alice
said
madden
as
he
walked
with
his
eldest
daughter
on
the
by
clevedon
shall
take
steps
for
insuring
my
life
for
a
thousand
pounds
it
was
the
outcome
of
a
long
and
intimate
conversation
alice
madden
aged
nineteen
a
plain
shy
girl
short
of
stature
and
in
movement
something
less
than
graceful
wore
a
pleased
look
as
she
glanced
at
her
father
face
and
then
turned
her
eyes
across
the
blue
channel
to
the
welsh
hills
she
was
flattered
by
the
confidence
reposed
in
her
for
madden
reticent
by
nature
had
never
been
known
to
speak
in
the
domestic
circle
about
his
pecuniary
affairs
he
seemed
to
be
the
kind
of
man
who
would
inspire
his
children
with
affection
grave
but
benign
amiably
diffident
with
a
hint
of
lurking
mirthfulness
about
his
eyes
and
lips
and
he
was
in
the
best
of
humours
professional
prospects
as
he
had
just
explained
to
alice
were
more
encouraging
than
hitherto
for
twenty
years
he
had
practised
medicine
at
clevedon
but
with
such
trifling
emolument
that
the
needs
of
his
large
family
left
him
scarce
a
margin
over
expenditure
now
at
the
age
of
it
was
he
looked
forward
with
a
larger
hope
might
he
not
reasonably
count
on
ten
or
fifteen
more
years
of
activity
clevedon
was
growing
in
repute
as
a
seaside
resort
new
houses
were
rising
assuredly
his
practice
would
continue
to
extend
do
think
girls
ought
to
be
troubled
about
this
kind
of
thing
he
added
apologetically
men
grapple
with
the
world
for
as
the
old
hymn
says
is
their
nature
to
i
should
grieve
indeed
if
i
thought
my
girls
would
ever
have
to
distress
themselves
about
money
matters
but
i
find
i
have
got
into
the
habit
alice
of
talking
to
you
very
much
as
i
should
talk
with
your
dear
mother
if
she
were
with
us
madden
having
given
birth
to
six
daughters
had
fulfilled
her
function
in
this
wonderful
world
for
two
years
she
had
been
resting
in
the
old
churchyard
that
looks
upon
the
severn
sea
father
and
daughter
sighed
as
they
recalled
her
memory
a
sweet
calm
unpretending
woman
admirable
in
the
domesticities
in
speech
and
thought
distinguished
by
a
native
refinement
which
in
the
most
fastidious
eyes
would
have
established
her
claim
to
the
title
of
lady
she
had
known
but
little
repose
and
secret
anxieties
told
upon
her
countenance
long
before
the
final
collapse
of
health
yet
pursued
the
doctor
doctor
only
by
courtesy
when
he
had
stooped
to
pluck
and
examine
a
flower
made
a
point
of
never
discussing
these
matters
with
her
as
no
doubt
you
guess
life
has
been
rather
an
uphill
journey
with
us
but
the
home
must
be
guarded
against
sordid
cares
to
the
last
possible
moment
nothing
upsets
me
more
than
the
sight
of
those
poor
homes
where
wife
and
children
are
obliged
to
talk
from
morning
to
night
of
how
the
sorry
earnings
shall
be
laid
out
no
no
women
old
or
young
should
never
have
to
think
about
money
the
magnificent
summer
sunshine
and
the
western
breeze
that
tasted
of
ocean
heightened
his
natural
cheeriness
madden
fell
into
a
familiar
strain
of
prescience
will
come
a
day
alice
when
neither
man
nor
woman
is
troubled
with
such
sordid
care
not
yet
awhile
no
no
but
the
day
will
come
human
beings
are
not
destined
to
struggle
for
ever
like
beasts
of
prey
give
them
time
let
civilization
grow
you
know
what
our
poet
says
there
the
common
sense
of
most
shall
hold
a
fretful
realm
in
awe
he
quoted
the
couplet
with
a
subdued
fervour
which
characterized
the
man
and
explained
his
worldly
lot
elkanah
madden
should
never
have
entered
the
medical
profession
mere
humanitarianism
had
prompted
the
choice
in
his
dreamy
youth
he
became
an
empiric
nothing
more
poet
said
the
doctor
clevedon
was
chiefly
interesting
to
him
for
its
literary
associations
tennyson
he
worshipped
he
never
passed
coleridge
cottage
without
bowing
in
spirit
from
the
contact
of
coarse
actualities
his
nature
shrank
when
he
and
alice
returned
from
their
walk
it
was
the
hour
of
family
tea
a
guest
was
present
this
afternoon
the
eight
persons
who
sat
down
to
table
were
as
many
as
the
little
parlour
could
comfortably
contain
of
the
sisters
next
in
age
to
alice
came
virginia
a
pretty
but
delicate
girl
of
seventeen
gertrude
martha
and
isabel
ranging
from
fourteen
to
ten
had
no
physical
charm
but
that
of
youthfulness
isabel
surpassed
her
eldest
sister
in
downright
plainness
of
feature
the
youngest
monica
was
a
bonny
little
maiden
only
just
five
years
old
dark
and
the
parents
had
omitted
no
care
in
shepherding
their
fold
partly
at
home
and
partly
in
local
schools
the
young
ladies
had
received
instruction
suitable
to
their
breeding
and
the
elder
ones
were
disposed
to
better
this
education
by
private
study
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
intellectual
books
especially
the
poets
lay
in
every
room
but
it
never
occurred
to
madden
that
his
daughters
would
do
well
to
study
with
a
professional
object
in
hours
of
melancholy
he
had
of
course
dreaded
the
risks
of
life
and
resolved
always
with
postponement
to
make
some
practical
provision
for
his
family
in
educating
them
as
well
as
circumstances
allowed
he
conceived
that
he
was
doing
the
next
best
thing
to
saving
money
for
if
a
fatality
befell
teaching
would
always
be
their
resource
the
thought
however
of
his
girls
having
to
work
for
money
was
so
utterly
repulsive
to
him
that
he
could
never
seriously
dwell
upon
it
a
vague
piety
supported
his
courage
providence
would
not
deal
harshly
with
him
and
his
dear
ones
he
enjoyed
excellent
health
his
practice
decidedly
improved
the
one
duty
clearly
before
him
was
to
set
an
example
of
righteous
life
and
to
develop
the
girls
minds
in
every
proper
direction
for
as
to
training
them
for
any
path
save
those
trodden
by
english
ladies
of
the
familiar
type
he
could
not
have
dreamt
of
any
such
thing
hopes
for
the
race
were
inseparable
from
a
maintenance
of
morals
and
conventions
such
as
the
average
man
assumes
in
his
estimate
of
women
the
guest
at
table
was
a
young
girl
named
rhoda
nunn
tall
thin
but
with
promise
of
bodily
vigour
she
was
singled
at
a
glance
as
no
member
of
the
madden
family
her
immaturity
but
fifteen
she
looked
two
years
older
appeared
in
nervous
restlessness
and
in
her
manner
of
speaking
childish
at
times
in
the
hustling
of
inconsequent
thoughts
yet
striving
to
imitate
the
talk
of
her
seniors
she
had
a
good
head
in
both
senses
of
the
phrase
might
or
might
not
develop
a
certain
beauty
but
would
assuredly
put
forth
the
fruits
of
intellect
her
mother
an
invalid
was
spending
the
summer
months
at
clevedon
with
madden
for
medical
adviser
and
in
this
way
the
girl
became
friendly
with
the
madden
household
its
younger
members
she
treated
rather
condescendingly
childish
things
she
had
long
ago
put
away
and
her
sole
pleasure
was
in
intellectual
talk
with
a
frankness
peculiar
to
her
indicative
of
pride
miss
nunn
let
it
be
known
that
she
would
have
to
earn
her
living
probably
as
a
school
teacher
study
for
examinations
occupied
most
of
her
day
and
her
hours
of
leisure
were
frequently
spent
either
at
the
maddens
or
with
a
family
named
smithson
people
these
latter
for
whom
she
had
a
profound
and
somewhat
mysterious
admiration
smithson
a
widower
with
a
consumptive
daughter
was
a
man
of
about
secretly
much
disliked
by
madden
because
of
his
aggressive
radicalism
if
women
observation
could
be
trusted
rhoda
nunn
had
simply
fallen
in
love
with
him
had
made
him
perhaps
unconsciously
the
object
of
her
earliest
passion
alice
and
virginia
commented
on
the
fact
in
their
private
colloquy
with
a
shamefaced
amusement
they
feared
that
it
spoke
ill
for
the
young
lady
breeding
none
the
less
they
thought
rhoda
a
remarkable
person
and
listened
to
her
utterances
respectfully
what
is
your
latest
paradox
miss
nunn
inquired
the
doctor
with
grave
facetiousness
when
he
had
looked
round
the
young
faces
at
his
board
i
forget
doctor
oh
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
do
you
think
women
ought
to
sit
in
parliament
no
was
the
response
as
if
after
due
consideration
they
are
there
at
all
they
ought
to
stand
i
ca
get
you
to
talk
seriously
rejoined
rhoda
with
an
air
of
vexation
whilst
the
others
were
laughing
smithson
thinks
there
ought
to
be
female
members
of
parliament
he
have
the
girls
told
you
that
there
a
nightingale
in
williams
orchard
it
was
always
thus
madden
did
not
care
to
discuss
even
playfully
the
radical
notions
which
rhoda
got
from
her
objectionable
friend
his
daughters
would
not
have
ventured
to
express
an
opinion
on
such
topics
when
he
was
present
apart
with
miss
nunn
they
betrayed
a
timid
interest
in
whatever
proposition
she
advanced
but
no
gleam
of
originality
distinguished
their
arguments
after
tea
the
little
company
fell
into
groups
some
out
of
doors
beneath
the
others
near
the
piano
at
which
virginia
was
playing
mendelssohn
monica
ran
about
among
them
with
her
prattle
ever
watched
by
her
father
who
lounged
in
a
canvas
chair
against
the
sunny
ivied
wall
pipe
in
mouth
madden
was
thinking
how
happy
they
made
him
these
kind
gentle
girls
how
his
love
for
them
seemed
to
ripen
with
every
summer
what
a
delightful
old
age
his
would
be
when
some
were
married
and
had
children
of
their
own
and
the
others
tended
him
they
whom
he
had
tended
virginia
would
probably
be
sought
in
marriage
she
had
good
looks
a
graceful
demeanour
a
bright
understanding
gertrude
also
perhaps
and
little
monica
ah
little
monica
she
would
be
the
beauty
of
the
family
when
monica
had
grown
up
it
would
be
time
for
him
to
retire
from
practice
by
then
he
would
doubtless
have
saved
money
he
must
find
more
society
for
them
they
had
always
been
too
much
alone
whence
their
shyness
among
strangers
if
their
mother
had
but
lived
wishes
you
to
read
us
something
father
said
his
eldest
girl
who
had
approached
whilst
he
was
lost
in
dream
he
often
read
aloud
to
them
from
the
poets
coleridge
and
tennyson
by
preference
little
persuasion
was
needed
alice
brought
the
volume
and
he
selected
the
girls
grouped
themselves
about
him
delighted
to
listen
many
an
hour
of
summer
evening
had
they
thus
spent
none
more
peaceful
than
the
present
the
reader
cadenced
voice
blended
with
the
song
of
a
thrush
let
us
alone
time
driveth
onward
fast
and
in
a
little
while
our
lips
are
dumb
let
us
alone
what
is
it
that
will
last
all
things
are
taken
from
us
there
came
an
interruption
hurried
peremptory
a
farmer
over
at
kingston
seymour
had
been
seized
with
alarming
illness
the
doctor
must
come
at
once
sorry
girls
tell
james
to
put
the
horse
in
sharp
as
he
can
in
ten
minutes
madden
was
driving
at
full
speed
alone
in
his
towards
the
scene
of
duty
about
seven
rhoda
nunn
took
leave
remarking
with
her
usual
directness
that
before
going
home
she
would
walk
along
the
in
the
hope
of
a
meeting
with
smithson
and
his
daughter
nunn
was
not
well
enough
to
leave
the
house
but
said
rhoda
the
invalid
preferred
being
left
alone
at
such
times
you
sure
she
prefers
it
alice
ventured
to
ask
the
girl
gave
her
a
look
of
surprise
should
mother
say
what
she
does
mean
it
was
uttered
with
an
ingenuousness
which
threw
some
light
on
character
by
nine
the
younger
trio
of
sisters
had
gone
to
bed
alice
virginia
and
gertrude
sat
in
the
parlour
occupied
with
books
from
time
to
time
exchanging
a
quiet
remark
a
tap
at
the
door
scarcely
drew
their
attention
for
they
supposed
it
was
the
coming
to
lay
supper
but
when
the
door
opened
there
was
a
mysterious
silence
alice
looked
up
and
saw
the
expected
face
wearing
however
so
strange
an
expression
that
she
rose
with
sudden
fear
i
speak
to
you
please
miss
the
dialogue
out
in
the
passage
was
brief
a
messenger
had
just
arrived
with
the
tidings
that
madden
driving
back
from
kingston
seymour
had
been
thrown
from
his
vehicle
and
lay
insensible
at
a
roadside
cottage
for
some
time
the
doctor
had
been
intending
to
buy
a
new
horse
his
faithful
old
roadster
was
very
weak
in
the
knees
as
in
other
matters
so
in
this
postponement
became
fatality
the
horse
stumbled
and
fell
and
its
driver
was
flung
head
forward
into
the
road
some
hours
later
they
brought
him
to
his
home
and
for
a
day
or
two
there
were
hopes
that
he
might
rally
but
the
sufferer
respite
only
permitted
him
to
dictate
and
sign
a
brief
will
this
duty
performed
madden
closed
his
lips
for
ever
chapter
ii
adrift
just
before
christmas
of
a
lady
past
her
twenties
and
with
a
look
of
discouraged
weariness
on
her
thin
face
knocked
at
a
in
a
little
street
by
lavender
hill
a
card
in
the
window
gave
notice
that
a
bedroom
was
here
to
let
when
the
door
opened
and
a
clean
grave
elderly
woman
presented
herself
the
visitor
regarding
her
anxiously
made
known
that
she
was
in
search
of
a
lodging
may
be
for
a
few
weeks
only
or
it
may
be
for
a
longer
period
she
said
in
a
low
tired
voice
with
an
accent
of
good
breeding
have
a
difficulty
in
finding
precisely
what
i
want
one
room
would
be
sufficient
and
i
ask
for
very
little
attendance
she
had
but
one
room
to
let
replied
the
other
it
might
be
inspected
they
went
upstairs
the
room
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
small
but
neatly
furnished
its
appearance
seemed
to
gratify
the
visitor
for
she
smiled
timidly
rent
should
you
ask
would
depend
mum
on
what
attendance
was
required
of
course
i
think
will
you
permit
me
to
sit
down
i
am
really
very
tired
thank
you
i
require
very
little
attendance
indeed
my
ways
are
very
simple
i
should
make
the
bed
myself
and
and
do
the
other
little
things
that
are
necessary
from
day
to
day
perhaps
i
might
ask
you
to
sweep
the
room
out
once
a
week
or
so
the
landlady
grew
meditative
possibly
she
had
had
experience
of
lodgers
who
were
anxious
to
give
as
little
trouble
as
possible
she
glanced
furtively
at
the
stranger
what
was
her
question
at
length
you
be
thinking
of
paying
i
had
better
explain
my
position
for
several
years
i
have
been
companion
to
a
lady
in
hampshire
her
death
has
thrown
me
on
my
own
resources
i
hope
only
for
a
short
time
i
have
come
to
london
because
a
younger
sister
of
mine
is
employed
here
in
a
house
of
business
she
recommended
me
to
seek
for
lodgings
in
this
part
i
might
as
well
be
near
her
whilst
i
am
endeavouring
to
find
another
post
perhaps
i
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
one
in
london
quietness
and
economy
are
necessary
to
me
a
house
like
yours
would
suit
me
very
well
very
well
indeed
could
we
not
agree
upon
terms
within
my
within
my
power
again
the
landlady
pondered
you
be
willing
to
pay
five
and
sixpence
i
would
pay
five
and
sixpence
if
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
could
let
me
live
in
my
own
way
with
satisfaction
to
yourself
i
in
fact
i
am
a
vegetarian
and
as
the
meals
i
take
are
so
very
simple
i
feel
that
i
might
just
as
well
prepare
them
myself
would
you
object
to
my
doing
so
in
this
room
a
kettle
and
a
saucepan
are
really
all
absolutely
all
that
i
should
need
to
use
as
i
shall
be
much
at
home
it
will
be
of
course
necessary
for
me
to
have
a
fire
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
an
agreement
had
been
devised
which
seemed
fairly
satisfactory
to
both
parties
not
one
of
the
graspin
ones
remarked
the
landlady
think
i
may
say
that
of
myself
if
i
make
five
or
six
shillings
a
week
out
of
my
spare
room
i
do
grumble
but
the
party
as
takes
it
must
do
their
duty
on
side
you
have
told
me
your
name
yet
mum
madden
my
luggage
is
at
the
railway
station
it
shall
be
brought
here
this
evening
and
as
i
am
quite
unknown
to
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
pay
my
rent
in
advance
i
do
ask
for
that
but
it
just
as
you
like
i
will
pay
you
five
and
sixpence
at
once
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
have
a
receipt
so
miss
madden
established
herself
at
lavender
hill
and
dwelt
there
alone
for
three
months
she
received
letters
frequently
but
only
one
person
called
upon
her
this
was
her
sister
monica
now
serving
at
a
draper
in
walworth
road
the
young
lady
came
every
sunday
and
in
bad
weather
spent
the
whole
day
up
in
the
little
bedroom
lodger
and
landlady
were
on
remarkably
good
terms
the
one
paid
her
dues
with
exactness
and
the
other
did
many
a
little
kindness
not
bargained
for
in
the
original
contract
time
went
on
to
the
spring
of
then
one
afternoon
miss
madden
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
tapped
in
her
usual
timid
way
at
the
door
you
at
leisure
conisbee
could
i
have
a
little
conversation
with
you
the
landlady
was
alone
and
with
no
more
engrossing
occupation
than
the
ironing
of
some
linen
she
had
recently
washed
have
mentioned
my
elder
sister
now
and
then
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
is
leaving
her
post
with
the
family
at
hereford
the
children
are
going
to
school
so
that
her
services
are
no
longer
needed
mum
for
a
shorter
or
longer
time
she
will
be
in
need
of
a
home
now
it
has
occurred
to
me
conisbee
that
that
i
would
ask
you
whether
you
would
have
any
objection
to
her
sharing
my
room
with
me
of
course
there
must
be
an
extra
payment
the
room
is
small
for
two
persons
but
then
the
arrangement
would
only
be
temporary
my
sister
is
a
good
and
experienced
teacher
and
i
am
sure
she
will
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
another
engagement
conisbee
reflected
but
without
a
shade
of
discontent
by
this
time
she
knew
that
her
lodger
was
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
it
if
can
manage
mum
she
replied
do
see
as
i
could
have
any
fault
to
find
if
you
thought
you
could
both
live
in
that
little
room
and
as
for
the
rent
should
be
quite
satisfied
if
we
said
seven
shillings
instead
of
five
and
six
you
conisbee
thank
you
very
much
indeed
i
will
write
to
my
sister
at
once
the
news
will
be
a
great
relief
to
her
we
shall
have
quite
an
enjoyable
little
holiday
together
a
week
later
the
eldest
of
the
three
miss
maddens
arrived
as
it
was
quite
impossible
to
find
space
for
her
boxes
in
the
bedroom
conisbee
allowed
them
to
be
deposited
in
the
room
occupied
by
her
daughter
which
was
on
the
same
floor
in
a
day
or
two
the
sisters
had
begun
a
life
of
orderly
tenor
when
weather
permitted
they
were
out
either
in
the
morning
or
afternoon
alice
madden
was
in
london
for
the
first
time
she
desired
to
see
the
sights
but
suffered
the
restrictions
of
poverty
and
after
nightfall
neither
she
nor
virginia
ever
left
home
there
was
not
much
personal
likeness
between
them
the
elder
now
tended
to
corpulence
the
result
of
sedentary
life
she
had
round
shoulders
and
very
short
legs
her
face
would
not
have
been
disagreeable
but
for
its
spoilt
complexion
the
homely
features
if
health
had
but
rounded
and
coloured
them
would
have
expressed
pleasantly
enough
the
gentleness
and
sincerity
of
her
character
her
cheeks
were
loose
puffy
and
permanently
of
the
hue
which
is
produced
by
cold
her
forehead
generally
had
a
few
pimples
her
shapeless
chin
lost
itself
in
two
or
three
fleshy
fissures
scarcely
less
shy
than
in
girlhood
she
walked
with
a
quick
ungainly
movement
as
if
seeking
to
escape
from
some
one
her
head
bent
forward
virginia
about
had
also
an
unhealthy
look
but
the
poverty
or
vitiation
of
her
blood
manifested
itself
in
less
unsightly
forms
one
saw
that
she
had
been
comely
and
from
certain
points
of
view
her
countenance
still
had
a
grace
a
sweetness
all
the
more
noticeable
because
of
its
threatened
extinction
for
she
was
rapidly
ageing
her
lax
lips
grew
laxer
with
emphasis
of
a
characteristic
one
would
rather
not
have
perceived
there
her
eyes
sank
into
deeper
hollows
wrinkles
extended
their
network
the
flesh
of
her
neck
wore
away
her
tall
meagre
body
did
not
seem
strong
enough
to
hold
itself
upright
alice
had
brown
hair
but
very
little
of
it
virginia
was
inclined
to
be
ruddy
it
surmounted
her
small
head
in
coils
and
plaits
not
without
beauty
the
voice
of
the
elder
sister
had
contracted
an
unpleasant
hoarseness
but
she
spoke
with
good
enunciation
a
slight
stiffness
and
pedantry
of
phrase
came
no
doubt
of
her
scholastic
habits
virginia
was
much
more
natural
in
manner
and
fluent
in
speech
even
as
she
moved
far
more
gracefully
it
was
now
sixteen
years
since
the
death
of
madden
of
clevedon
the
story
of
his
daughters
lives
in
the
interval
may
be
told
with
brevity
suitable
to
so
unexciting
a
narrative
when
the
doctor
affairs
were
set
in
order
it
was
found
that
the
patrimony
of
his
six
girls
amounted
as
nearly
as
possible
to
eight
hundred
pounds
eight
hundred
pounds
is
to
be
sure
a
sum
of
money
but
how
in
these
circumstances
was
it
to
be
applied
there
came
over
from
cheltenham
a
bachelor
uncle
aged
about
sixty
this
gentleman
lived
on
an
annuity
of
seventy
pounds
which
would
terminate
when
did
it
might
be
reckoned
to
him
for
righteousness
that
he
spent
the
railway
fare
between
cheltenham
and
clevedon
to
attend
his
brother
funeral
and
to
speak
a
kind
word
to
his
nieces
influence
he
had
none
initiative
very
little
there
was
no
reckoning
upon
him
for
aid
of
any
kind
from
richmond
in
yorkshire
in
reply
to
a
letter
from
alice
wrote
an
old
old
aunt
of
the
late
madden
who
had
occasionally
sent
the
girls
presents
her
communication
was
barely
legible
it
seemed
to
contain
fortifying
texts
of
scripture
but
nothing
in
the
way
of
worldly
counsel
this
old
lady
had
no
possessions
to
bequeath
and
as
far
as
the
girls
knew
she
was
their
mother
only
surviving
relative
the
executor
of
the
will
was
a
clevedon
tradesman
a
kind
and
capable
friend
of
the
family
for
many
years
a
man
of
parts
and
attainments
superior
to
his
station
in
council
with
certain
other
persons
who
regarded
the
maddens
circumstances
with
friendly
anxiety
hungerford
testamentary
instruction
allowing
him
much
freedom
of
action
decided
that
the
three
elder
girls
must
forthwith
become
and
that
the
three
younger
should
live
together
in
the
care
of
a
lady
of
small
means
who
offered
to
house
and
keep
them
for
the
bare
outlay
necessitated
a
prudent
investment
of
the
eight
hundred
pounds
might
by
this
arrangement
feed
clothe
and
in
some
sort
educate
martha
isabel
and
monica
to
see
thus
far
ahead
sufficed
for
the
present
fresh
circumstances
could
be
dealt
with
as
they
arose
alice
obtained
a
situation
as
at
sixteen
pounds
a
year
virginia
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
accepted
as
companion
by
a
gentlewoman
at
her
payment
twelve
pounds
gertrude
fourteen
years
old
also
went
to
weston
where
she
was
offered
employment
in
a
shop
her
payment
nothing
at
all
but
lodging
board
and
dress
assured
to
her
ten
years
went
by
and
saw
many
changes
gertrude
and
martha
were
dead
the
former
of
consumption
the
other
drowned
by
the
overturning
of
a
hungerford
also
was
dead
and
a
new
guardian
administered
the
fund
which
was
still
a
common
property
of
the
four
surviving
daughters
alice
plied
her
domestic
teaching
virginia
remained
a
isabel
now
aged
twenty
taught
in
a
board
school
at
bridgewater
and
monica
just
fifteen
was
on
the
point
of
being
apprenticed
to
a
draper
at
weston
where
virginia
abode
to
serve
behind
a
counter
would
not
have
been
monica
choice
if
any
more
liberal
employment
had
seemed
within
her
reach
she
had
no
aptitude
whatever
for
giving
instruction
indeed
had
no
aptitude
for
anything
but
being
a
pretty
cheerful
engaging
girl
much
dependent
on
the
love
and
gentleness
of
those
about
her
in
speech
and
bearing
monica
greatly
resembled
her
mother
that
is
to
say
she
had
native
elegance
certainly
it
might
be
deemed
a
pity
that
such
a
girl
could
not
be
introduced
to
one
of
the
higher
walks
of
life
but
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
something
and
the
people
to
whose
guidance
she
looked
had
but
narrow
experience
of
life
alice
and
virginia
sighed
over
the
contrast
with
bygone
hopes
but
their
own
careers
made
it
seem
probable
that
monica
would
be
better
off
business
than
in
a
more
strictly
genteel
position
and
there
was
every
likelihood
that
at
such
a
place
as
weston
with
her
sister
for
occasional
chaperon
she
would
ere
long
find
herself
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
working
for
a
livelihood
to
the
others
no
wooer
had
yet
presented
himself
alice
if
she
had
ever
dreamt
of
marriage
must
by
now
have
resigned
herself
to
spinsterhood
virginia
could
scarce
hope
that
her
faded
prettiness
her
health
damaged
by
attendance
upon
an
exacting
invalid
and
in
profitless
study
when
she
ought
to
have
been
sleeping
would
attract
any
man
in
search
of
a
wife
poor
isabel
was
so
extremely
plain
monica
if
her
promise
were
fulfilled
would
be
by
far
the
best
looking
as
well
as
the
sprightliest
of
the
family
she
must
marry
of
course
she
must
marry
her
sisters
gladdened
in
the
thought
isabel
was
soon
worked
into
illness
brain
trouble
came
on
resulting
in
melancholia
a
charitable
institution
ultimately
received
her
and
there
at
the
poor
girl
drowned
herself
in
a
bath
their
numbers
had
thus
been
reduced
by
half
up
to
now
the
income
of
their
eight
hundred
pounds
had
served
impartially
the
ends
now
of
this
now
of
that
one
doing
a
little
good
to
all
saving
them
from
many
an
hour
of
bitterness
which
must
else
have
been
added
to
their
lot
by
a
new
arrangement
the
capital
was
at
length
made
over
to
alice
and
virginia
jointly
the
youngest
sister
having
a
claim
upon
them
to
the
extent
of
an
annual
nine
pounds
a
trifle
but
it
would
buy
her
clothing
and
then
monica
was
sure
to
marry
thank
heaven
she
was
sure
to
marry
without
notable
event
matrimonial
or
other
time
went
on
to
this
present
year
of
late
in
june
monica
would
complete
her
year
the
elders
full
of
affection
for
the
sister
who
so
notably
surpassed
them
in
beauty
of
person
talked
much
about
her
as
the
time
approached
devising
how
to
procure
her
a
little
pleasure
on
her
birthday
virginia
thought
a
suitable
present
would
be
a
copy
of
christian
year
has
really
no
time
for
continuous
reading
a
verse
of
keble
just
one
verse
at
bedtime
and
in
the
morning
might
be
strength
to
the
poor
girl
alice
assented
must
join
to
buy
it
dear
she
added
with
anxious
look
would
be
justifiable
to
spend
more
than
two
or
three
shillings
fear
not
they
were
preparing
their
midday
meal
the
substantial
repast
of
the
day
in
a
little
saucepan
on
an
oil
was
some
plain
rice
bubbling
as
alice
stirred
it
virginia
fetched
from
downstairs
conisbee
had
assigned
to
them
a
shelf
in
her
larder
bread
butter
cheese
a
pot
of
preserve
and
arranged
the
table
three
feet
by
one
and
a
half
at
which
they
were
accustomed
to
eat
the
rice
being
ready
it
was
turned
out
in
two
proportions
made
savoury
with
a
little
butter
pepper
and
salt
it
invited
them
to
sit
down
as
they
had
been
out
in
the
morning
the
afternoon
would
be
spent
in
domestic
occupations
the
low
virginia
had
appropriated
to
her
sister
because
of
the
latter
headaches
and
backaches
and
other
disorders
she
herself
sat
on
an
ordinary
chair
of
the
bedside
species
to
which
by
this
time
she
had
become
used
their
sewing
when
they
did
any
was
strictly
indispensable
if
nothing
demanded
the
needle
both
preferred
a
book
alice
who
had
never
been
a
student
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
read
for
the
twentieth
time
a
few
volumes
in
her
possession
poetry
popular
history
and
half
a
dozen
novels
such
as
the
average
mother
of
children
would
have
approved
in
the
hands
with
virginia
the
case
was
somewhat
different
up
to
about
her
year
she
had
pursued
one
subject
with
a
zeal
limited
only
by
her
opportunities
study
absolutely
disinterested
seeing
that
she
had
never
supposed
it
would
increase
her
value
as
a
or
enable
her
to
take
any
better
position
her
one
intellectual
desire
was
to
know
as
much
as
possible
about
ecclesiastical
history
not
in
a
spirit
of
fanaticism
she
was
devout
but
in
moderation
and
never
spoke
bitterly
on
religious
topics
the
growth
of
the
christian
church
old
sects
and
schisms
the
councils
affairs
of
papal
policy
these
things
had
a
very
genuine
interest
for
her
circumstances
favouring
she
might
have
become
an
erudite
woman
but
the
conditions
were
so
far
from
favourable
that
all
she
succeeded
in
doing
was
to
undermine
her
health
upon
a
sudden
breakdown
there
followed
mental
lassitude
from
which
she
never
recovered
it
being
subsequently
her
duty
to
read
novels
aloud
for
the
lady
whom
she
new
novels
at
the
rate
of
a
volume
a
day
she
lost
all
power
of
giving
her
mind
to
anything
but
the
feebler
fiction
nowadays
she
procured
such
works
from
a
lending
library
on
a
subscription
of
a
shilling
a
month
ashamed
at
first
to
indulge
this
taste
before
alice
she
tried
more
solid
literature
but
this
either
sent
her
to
sleep
or
induced
headache
the
feeble
novels
reappeared
and
as
alice
made
no
adverse
comment
they
soon
came
and
went
with
the
old
regularity
this
afternoon
the
sisters
were
disposed
for
conversation
the
same
grave
thought
preoccupied
both
of
them
and
they
soon
made
it
their
subject
alice
began
by
murmuring
half
absently
shall
soon
hear
of
something
am
dreadfully
uneasy
on
my
own
account
her
sister
replied
think
the
person
at
southend
wo
write
again
afraid
not
and
she
seemed
so
unsatisfactory
positively
illiterate
oh
i
could
bear
that
virginia
gave
a
shudder
as
she
spoke
almost
wish
said
alice
i
had
accepted
the
place
at
plymouth
my
dear
five
children
and
not
a
penny
of
salary
it
was
a
shameless
proposal
was
indeed
sighed
the
poor
governess
there
is
so
little
choice
for
people
like
myself
certificates
and
even
degrees
are
asked
for
on
every
hand
with
nothing
but
references
to
past
employers
what
can
one
expect
i
know
it
will
end
in
my
taking
a
place
without
salary
seem
to
have
still
less
need
of
lamented
the
companion
wish
now
that
i
had
gone
to
norwich
as
your
health
would
have
supported
it
do
know
possibly
the
more
active
life
might
do
me
good
it
you
know
alice
the
other
admitted
this
possibility
with
a
deep
sigh
us
review
our
position
she
then
exclaimed
it
was
a
phrase
frequently
on
her
lips
and
always
made
her
more
cheerful
virginia
also
seemed
to
welcome
it
as
an
encouragement
said
the
companion
almost
as
serious
as
it
could
be
i
have
only
one
pound
left
with
the
exception
of
the
dividend
have
rather
more
than
four
pounds
still
now
let
us
think
alice
paused
we
neither
of
us
obtain
employment
before
the
end
of
this
year
we
have
to
live
in
that
case
more
than
six
months
you
on
seven
pounds
and
i
on
ten
impossible
said
virginia
us
see
put
it
in
another
form
we
have
both
to
live
together
on
seventeen
pounds
that
is
she
made
a
computation
on
a
piece
of
paper
is
two
pounds
sixteen
shillings
and
eightpence
a
month
let
us
suppose
this
month
at
an
end
that
represents
fourteen
shillings
and
twopence
a
week
yes
we
can
do
it
she
laid
down
her
pencil
with
an
air
of
triumph
her
dull
eyes
brightened
as
though
she
had
discovered
a
new
source
of
income
can
not
dear
urged
virginia
in
a
subdued
voice
shillings
rent
that
leaves
only
seven
and
twopence
a
week
for
everything
everything
do
it
dear
persisted
the
other
it
came
to
the
very
worst
our
food
need
not
cost
more
than
sixpence
a
day
three
and
sixpence
a
week
i
do
really
believe
virgie
we
could
support
life
on
less
say
on
fourpence
yes
we
could
dear
they
looked
fixedly
at
each
other
like
people
about
to
stake
everything
on
their
courage
such
a
life
worthy
of
the
name
asked
virginia
in
tones
of
awe
sha
be
driven
to
that
oh
we
certainly
shall
not
but
it
helps
one
to
know
that
strictly
speaking
we
are
for
another
six
months
that
word
gave
virginia
an
obvious
thrill
oh
alice
what
a
blessed
thing
is
independence
do
you
know
my
dear
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
exerted
myself
as
i
might
have
done
to
find
a
new
place
these
comfortable
lodgings
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
monica
once
a
week
have
tempted
me
into
idleness
it
really
my
wish
to
be
idle
i
know
the
harm
it
does
me
but
oh
if
one
could
work
in
a
home
of
one
own
alice
had
a
startled
apprehensive
look
as
if
her
sister
were
touching
on
a
subject
hardly
proper
for
discussion
or
at
least
dangerous
afraid
it
no
use
thinking
of
that
dear
she
answered
awkwardly
use
no
use
whatever
i
am
wrong
to
indulge
in
such
thoughts
happens
my
dear
said
alice
presently
with
all
the
impressiveness
of
tone
she
could
command
must
never
entrench
upon
our
capital
never
never
never
if
we
grow
old
and
useless
no
one
will
give
us
even
board
and
lodging
for
our
services
we
have
a
friend
to
look
to
alice
threw
in
as
though
they
were
answering
each
other
in
a
doleful
litany
indeed
we
shall
be
glad
that
nothing
tempted
us
to
entrench
on
our
capital
it
would
just
keep
us
her
voice
sank
the
workhouse
after
this
each
took
up
a
volume
and
until
teatime
they
read
quietly
from
six
to
nine
in
the
evening
they
again
talked
and
read
alternately
their
conversation
was
now
retrospective
each
revived
memories
of
what
she
had
endured
in
one
or
the
other
house
of
bondage
never
had
it
been
their
lot
to
serve
nice
people
this
phrase
of
theirs
was
anything
but
meaningless
they
had
lived
with
more
or
less
families
in
the
lower
middle
class
people
who
could
not
have
inherited
refinement
and
had
not
acquired
any
neither
proletarians
nor
gentlefolk
consumed
with
a
disease
of
vulgar
pretentiousness
inflated
with
the
miasma
of
democracy
it
would
have
been
but
a
natural
result
of
such
a
life
if
the
sisters
had
commented
upon
it
in
a
spirit
somewhat
akin
to
that
of
their
employers
but
they
spoke
without
rancour
without
scandalmongering
they
knew
themselves
superior
to
the
women
who
had
grudgingly
paid
them
and
often
smiled
at
recollections
which
would
have
moved
the
servile
mind
to
venomous
abuse
at
nine
they
took
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
a
biscuit
and
half
an
hour
later
they
went
to
bed
lamp
oil
was
costly
and
indeed
they
felt
glad
to
say
as
early
as
possible
that
another
day
had
gone
by
their
hour
of
rising
was
eight
conisbee
provided
hot
water
for
their
breakfast
on
descending
to
fetch
it
virginia
found
that
the
postman
had
left
a
letter
for
her
the
writing
on
the
envelope
seemed
to
be
a
stranger
she
ran
upstairs
again
in
excitement
can
this
be
from
alice
the
elder
sister
had
one
of
her
headaches
this
morning
she
was
clay
colour
and
tottered
in
moving
about
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
bedroom
would
alone
have
accounted
for
such
a
malady
but
an
unexpected
letter
made
her
for
the
moment
oblivious
of
suffering
in
london
she
said
examining
the
envelope
eagerly
one
you
have
been
in
correspondence
with
months
since
i
wrote
to
any
one
in
london
for
full
five
minutes
they
debated
the
mystery
afraid
of
dashing
their
hopes
by
breaking
the
envelope
at
length
virginia
summoned
courage
standing
at
a
distance
from
the
other
she
took
out
the
sheet
of
paper
with
tremulous
hand
and
glanced
fearfully
at
the
signature
you
think
it
miss
nunn
nunn
never
how
could
she
have
got
the
address
again
the
difficulty
was
discussed
whilst
its
ready
solution
lay
neglected
read
it
said
alice
at
length
her
throbbing
head
made
worse
by
the
agitation
obliging
her
to
sink
down
into
the
chair
the
letter
ran
thus
miss
madden
this
morning
i
chanced
to
meet
with
darby
who
was
passing
through
london
on
her
way
home
from
the
seaside
we
had
only
five
minutes
talk
it
was
at
a
railway
station
but
she
mentioned
that
you
were
at
present
in
london
and
gave
me
your
address
after
all
these
years
how
glad
i
should
be
to
see
you
the
struggle
of
life
has
made
me
selfish
i
have
neglected
my
old
friends
and
yet
i
am
bound
to
add
that
some
of
have
neglected
would
you
rather
that
i
came
to
your
lodgings
or
you
to
mine
which
you
like
i
hear
that
your
elder
sister
is
with
you
and
that
monica
is
also
in
london
somewhere
do
let
us
all
see
each
other
once
more
write
as
soon
as
you
can
my
kindest
regards
to
all
of
sincerely
yours
rhoda
nunn
like
her
exclaimed
virginia
when
she
had
read
this
aloud
remember
that
perhaps
we
may
not
care
to
receive
visitors
she
was
always
so
thoughtful
and
it
is
true
that
i
to
have
written
to
her
shall
go
to
her
of
course
yes
as
she
gives
us
the
choice
how
delightful
i
wonder
what
she
is
doing
she
writes
cheerfully
i
am
sure
she
must
be
in
a
good
position
what
is
the
address
queen
road
chelsea
oh
i
so
glad
it
not
very
far
we
can
walk
there
and
back
easily
for
several
years
they
had
lost
sight
of
rhoda
nunn
she
left
clevedon
shortly
after
the
maddens
were
scattered
and
they
heard
she
had
become
a
teacher
about
the
date
of
monica
apprenticeship
at
weston
miss
nunn
had
a
chance
meeting
with
virginia
and
the
younger
girl
she
was
still
teaching
but
spoke
of
her
work
with
extreme
discontent
and
hinted
at
vague
projects
whether
she
succeeded
in
releasing
herself
the
maddens
never
heard
it
was
a
morning
of
doubtful
fairness
before
going
to
bed
last
night
they
had
decided
to
walk
out
together
this
morning
and
purchase
the
present
for
monica
birthday
which
was
next
sunday
but
alice
felt
too
unwell
to
leave
the
house
virginia
should
write
a
reply
to
miss
nunn
letter
and
then
go
to
the
bookseller
alone
she
set
forth
at
nine
with
extreme
care
she
had
preserved
an
dress
into
the
third
summer
it
did
not
look
shabby
her
mantle
was
in
its
second
year
only
the
original
fawn
colour
had
gone
to
an
indeterminate
grey
her
hat
of
brown
straw
was
a
possession
for
ever
it
underwent
new
trimming
at
an
outlay
of
a
few
pence
when
that
became
unavoidable
yet
virginia
could
not
have
been
judged
anything
but
a
lady
she
wore
her
garments
as
only
a
lady
can
the
position
and
movement
of
the
arms
has
much
to
do
with
this
and
had
the
step
never
to
be
acquired
by
a
person
of
vulgar
instincts
a
very
long
walk
was
before
her
she
wished
to
get
as
far
as
the
strand
bookshops
not
only
for
the
sake
of
choice
but
because
this
region
pleased
her
and
gave
her
a
sense
of
holiday
past
battersea
park
over
chelsea
bridge
then
the
weary
stretch
to
victoria
station
and
the
upward
labour
to
charing
cross
five
miles
at
least
measured
by
pavement
but
virginia
walked
quickly
at
eleven
she
was
within
sight
of
her
goal
a
presentable
copy
of
keble
work
cost
less
than
she
had
imagined
this
rejoiced
her
but
after
leaving
the
shop
she
had
a
singular
expression
on
her
face
something
more
than
weariness
something
less
than
anxiety
something
other
than
calculation
in
front
of
charing
cross
station
she
stopped
looking
vaguely
about
her
perhaps
she
had
it
in
her
mind
to
return
home
by
omnibus
and
was
dreading
the
expense
yet
of
a
sudden
she
turned
and
went
up
the
approach
to
the
railway
at
the
entrance
again
she
stopped
her
features
were
now
working
in
the
strangest
way
as
though
a
difficulty
of
breathing
had
assailed
her
in
her
eyes
was
an
eager
yet
frightened
look
her
lips
stood
apart
another
quick
movement
and
she
entered
the
station
she
went
straight
to
the
door
of
the
refreshment
room
and
looked
in
through
the
glass
two
or
three
people
were
standing
inside
she
drew
back
a
tremor
passing
through
her
a
lady
came
out
then
again
virginia
approached
the
door
two
men
only
were
within
talking
together
with
a
hurried
nervous
movement
she
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
up
to
a
part
of
the
counter
as
far
as
possible
from
the
two
customers
bending
forward
she
said
to
the
barmaid
in
a
voice
just
above
a
whisper
give
me
a
little
brandy
beads
of
perspiration
were
on
her
face
which
had
turned
to
a
ghastly
pallor
the
barmaid
concluding
that
she
was
ill
served
her
promptly
and
with
a
sympathetic
look
virginia
added
to
the
spirit
twice
its
quantity
of
water
standing
as
she
did
so
half
turned
from
the
bar
then
she
sipped
hurriedly
two
or
three
times
and
at
length
took
a
draught
colour
flowed
to
her
cheeks
her
eyes
lost
their
frightened
glare
another
draught
finished
the
stimulant
she
hastily
wiped
her
lips
and
walked
away
with
firm
step
in
the
meantime
a
threatening
cloud
had
passed
from
the
sun
warm
rays
fell
upon
the
street
and
its
clamorous
life
virginia
felt
tired
in
body
but
a
delightful
animation
rarest
of
boons
gave
her
new
strength
she
walked
into
trafalgar
square
and
viewed
it
like
a
person
who
stands
there
for
the
first
time
smiling
interested
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
whilst
she
merely
enjoyed
the
air
the
sunshine
and
the
scene
about
her
such
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
calm
contented
unconsciously
hopeful
as
she
had
not
known
since
alice
coming
to
london
she
reached
the
house
by
one
bringing
in
a
paper
bag
something
which
was
to
serve
for
dinner
alice
had
a
wretched
appearance
her
head
ached
worse
than
ever
she
moaned
never
took
account
of
illness
you
know
we
must
keep
that
off
replied
the
other
sitting
down
with
a
look
of
exhaustion
she
smiled
but
no
longer
as
in
the
sunlight
of
trafalgar
square
i
must
struggle
against
it
we
will
have
dinner
as
soon
as
possible
i
feel
faint
if
both
of
them
had
avowed
their
faintness
as
often
as
they
felt
it
the
complaint
would
have
been
perpetual
but
they
generally
made
a
point
of
deceiving
each
other
and
tried
to
delude
themselves
professing
that
no
diet
could
be
better
for
their
particular
needs
than
this
which
poverty
imposed
it
a
good
sign
to
be
hungry
exclaimed
virginia
be
better
this
afternoon
dear
alice
turned
over
christian
year
and
endeavoured
to
console
herself
out
of
it
whilst
her
sister
prepared
the
meal
chapter
iii
an
independent
woman
virginia
reply
to
miss
nunn
letter
brought
another
note
next
morning
saturday
it
was
to
request
a
call
from
the
sisters
that
same
afternoon
alice
unfortunately
would
not
be
able
to
leave
home
her
disorder
had
become
a
feverish
cold
caught
doubtless
between
open
window
and
door
whilst
the
bedroom
was
being
aired
for
breakfast
she
lay
in
bed
and
her
sister
administered
remedies
of
the
chemist
advising
but
she
insisted
on
virginia
leaving
her
in
the
afternoon
miss
nunn
might
have
something
of
importance
to
tell
or
to
suggest
conisbee
sympathetic
in
her
crude
way
would
see
that
the
invalid
wanted
for
nothing
so
after
a
dinner
of
mashed
potatoes
and
milk
irish
peasantry
live
almost
entirely
on
that
croaked
alice
they
are
physically
a
fine
race
the
younger
sister
started
on
her
walk
to
chelsea
her
destination
was
a
plain
low
roomy
old
house
in
queen
road
over
against
the
hospital
gardens
on
asking
for
miss
nunn
she
was
led
to
a
back
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
there
waited
for
a
few
moments
several
large
bookcases
a
and
kindred
objects
indicated
that
the
occupant
of
the
house
was
studious
the
numerous
bunches
of
cut
flowers
which
agreeably
scented
the
air
seemed
to
prove
the
student
was
a
woman
miss
nunn
entered
younger
only
by
a
year
or
two
than
virginia
she
was
yet
far
from
presenting
any
sorrowful
image
of
a
person
on
the
way
to
she
had
a
clear
though
pale
skin
a
vigorous
frame
a
brisk
movement
all
the
signs
of
fairly
good
health
whether
or
not
she
could
be
called
a
comely
woman
might
have
furnished
matter
for
male
discussion
the
prevailing
voice
of
her
own
sex
would
have
denied
her
charm
of
feature
at
first
view
the
countenance
seemed
masculine
its
expression
somewhat
aggressive
eyes
shrewdly
observant
and
lips
consciously
impregnable
but
the
connoisseur
delayed
his
verdict
it
was
a
face
that
invited
that
compelled
study
intellectual
keenness
a
bright
humour
frank
courage
were
traits
legible
enough
and
when
the
lips
parted
to
show
their
warmth
their
fullness
when
the
eyelids
drooped
a
little
in
meditation
one
became
aware
of
a
suggestiveness
directed
not
solely
to
the
intellect
of
something
like
an
unfamiliar
sexual
type
remote
indeed
from
the
voluptuous
but
hinting
a
possibility
of
subtle
feminine
forces
that
might
be
released
by
circumstance
she
wore
a
black
serge
gown
with
white
collar
and
cuffs
her
thick
hair
rippled
low
upon
each
side
of
the
forehead
and
behind
was
gathered
into
loose
vertical
coils
in
shadow
the
hue
seemed
black
but
when
illumined
it
was
seen
to
be
the
darkest
warmest
brown
offering
a
strong
shapely
hand
she
looked
at
her
visitor
with
a
smile
which
betrayed
some
mixture
of
pain
in
the
hearty
welcome
how
long
have
you
been
in
london
it
was
the
tone
of
a
busy
practical
person
her
voice
had
not
much
softness
of
timbre
and
perhaps
on
that
account
she
kept
it
carefully
subdued
long
as
that
how
i
wish
i
had
known
you
were
so
near
i
have
been
in
london
myself
about
two
years
and
your
sisters
virginia
explained
alice
absence
adding
for
poor
monica
she
has
only
sunday
free
except
one
evening
a
month
she
is
at
business
till
nine
and
on
saturday
till
eleven
or
twelve
dear
dear
dear
exclaimed
the
other
rapidly
making
a
motion
with
her
hand
as
if
to
brush
away
something
disagreeable
will
never
do
you
must
put
a
stop
to
that
am
sure
we
ought
to
virginia
thin
timid
voice
and
weak
manner
were
thrown
into
painful
contrast
by
miss
nunn
personality
yes
we
will
talk
about
it
presently
poor
little
monica
but
do
tell
me
about
yourself
and
miss
madden
it
is
so
long
since
i
heard
about
you
i
ought
to
have
written
i
remember
that
at
the
end
of
our
correspondence
i
remained
in
your
debt
but
it
was
a
troublesome
and
depressing
time
with
me
i
had
nothing
but
groans
and
moans
to
send
did
stay
long
i
trust
with
that
trying
mrs
carr
years
sighed
virginia
your
patience
wished
to
leave
again
and
again
but
at
the
end
she
always
begged
me
not
to
desert
her
that
was
how
she
put
it
after
all
i
never
had
the
heart
to
go
kind
of
you
but
those
questions
are
so
difficult
to
decide
may
be
quite
wrong
i
afraid
you
think
so
asked
virginia
anxiously
i
am
sure
it
is
often
wrong
all
the
more
so
because
people
proclaim
it
a
virtue
without
any
reference
to
circumstances
then
how
did
you
get
away
at
last
poor
woman
died
then
i
had
a
place
scarcely
less
disagreeable
now
i
have
none
at
all
but
i
really
must
find
one
very
soon
she
laughed
at
this
allusion
to
her
poverty
and
made
nervous
motions
me
tell
you
what
my
own
course
has
been
said
miss
nunn
after
a
short
reflection
my
mother
died
i
determined
to
have
done
with
teaching
you
know
that
i
disliked
it
too
much
and
partly
of
course
because
i
was
incapable
half
my
teaching
was
a
sham
a
pretence
of
knowing
what
i
neither
knew
nor
cared
to
know
i
had
gone
into
it
like
most
girls
as
a
dreary
matter
of
course
poor
alice
i
afraid
it
a
distressing
subject
when
my
mother
left
me
that
little
sum
of
money
i
took
a
bold
step
i
went
to
bristol
to
learn
everything
i
could
that
would
help
me
out
of
school
life
shorthand
commercial
correspondence
i
had
lessons
in
them
all
and
worked
desperately
for
a
year
it
did
me
good
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
was
vastly
improved
in
health
and
felt
myself
worth
something
in
the
world
i
got
a
place
as
cashier
in
a
large
shop
that
soon
tired
me
and
by
dint
of
advertising
i
found
a
place
in
an
office
at
bath
it
was
a
move
towards
london
and
i
could
rest
till
i
had
come
the
whole
way
my
first
engagement
here
was
as
shorthand
writer
to
the
secretary
of
a
company
but
he
soon
wanted
some
one
who
could
use
a
typewriter
that
was
a
suggestion
i
went
to
learn
typewriting
and
the
lady
who
taught
me
asked
me
in
the
end
to
stay
with
her
as
an
assistant
this
is
her
house
and
here
i
live
with
her
energetic
you
have
been
fortunate
perhaps
i
must
tell
you
about
this
lady
miss
barfoot
she
has
private
means
not
large
but
sufficient
to
allow
of
her
combining
benevolence
with
business
she
makes
it
her
object
to
train
young
girls
for
work
in
offices
teaching
them
the
things
that
i
learnt
in
bristol
and
typewriting
as
well
some
pay
for
their
lessons
and
some
get
them
for
nothing
our
workrooms
are
in
great
portland
street
over
a
shop
one
or
two
girls
have
evening
lessons
but
our
pupils
for
the
most
part
are
able
to
come
in
the
day
miss
barfoot
has
much
interest
in
the
lower
classes
she
wishes
to
be
of
use
to
the
daughters
of
educated
people
and
she
is
of
use
she
is
doing
admirable
work
i
am
sure
she
must
be
what
a
wonderful
person
occurs
to
me
that
she
might
help
monica
do
you
think
she
would
exclaimed
virginia
with
eager
attention
grateful
we
should
be
is
monica
employed
a
draper
in
walworth
road
she
is
worked
to
death
every
week
i
see
a
difference
in
her
poor
child
we
hoped
to
persuade
her
to
go
back
to
the
shop
at
weston
but
if
this
you
speak
of
were
possible
how
better
we
have
never
reconciled
ourselves
to
her
being
in
that
position
never
see
no
harm
in
the
position
itself
replied
miss
nunn
in
her
rather
blunt
tone
i
see
a
great
deal
in
those
outrageous
hours
she
wo
easily
do
better
in
london
without
special
qualifications
and
probably
she
is
reluctant
to
go
back
to
the
country
she
is
very
reluctant
understand
it
said
the
other
with
a
nod
you
ask
her
to
come
and
see
me
a
servant
entered
with
tea
miss
nunn
caught
the
expression
in
her
visitor
eyes
and
said
cheerfully
had
no
midday
meal
and
really
i
feel
the
omission
mary
please
do
put
tea
in
the
and
bring
up
some
meat
miss
barfoot
she
added
in
explanation
to
virginia
is
out
of
town
and
i
am
a
shockingly
irregular
person
about
meals
i
am
sure
you
will
sit
down
with
me
virginia
sported
with
the
subject
months
of
miserable
eating
and
drinking
in
her
stuffy
bedroom
made
an
invitation
such
as
this
a
veritable
delight
to
her
seated
in
the
she
at
first
refused
the
offer
of
meat
alleging
her
vegetarianism
but
miss
nunn
convinced
that
the
poor
woman
was
starving
succeeded
in
persuading
her
a
slice
of
good
beef
had
much
the
same
effect
upon
virginia
as
her
more
dangerous
indulgence
at
charing
cross
station
she
brightened
wonderfully
let
us
go
back
to
the
library
said
miss
nunn
when
their
meal
was
over
shall
soon
see
each
other
again
i
hope
but
we
might
as
well
talk
of
serious
things
whilst
we
have
the
opportunity
will
you
allow
me
to
be
very
frank
with
you
the
other
looked
startled
could
you
possibly
say
that
would
offend
me
the
old
days
you
told
me
all
about
your
circumstances
are
they
still
the
same
the
same
most
happily
we
have
never
needed
to
entrench
upon
our
capital
whatever
happens
we
must
avoid
that
whatever
happens
quite
understand
you
but
would
it
be
possible
to
make
a
better
use
of
that
money
it
is
eight
hundred
pounds
i
think
have
you
never
thought
of
employing
it
in
some
practical
enterprise
virginia
at
first
shrank
in
alarm
then
trembled
deliciously
at
her
friend
bold
views
it
be
possible
really
you
think
can
only
suggest
of
course
one
must
argue
about
others
from
one
own
habit
of
thought
heaven
forbid
this
sounded
rather
profane
to
the
listener
i
should
urge
you
to
do
anything
you
would
think
rash
but
how
much
better
if
you
could
somehow
secure
independence
if
we
could
the
very
thing
we
were
saying
the
other
day
but
how
i
have
no
idea
how
miss
nunn
seemed
to
hesitate
do
advise
you
must
give
any
weight
to
what
i
say
except
in
so
far
as
your
own
judgment
approves
it
but
could
one
open
a
preparatory
school
for
instance
at
weston
suppose
where
already
you
know
a
good
many
people
or
even
at
clevedon
virginia
drew
in
her
breath
and
it
was
easy
for
miss
nunn
to
perceive
that
the
proposal
went
altogether
beyond
her
friend
scope
impossible
perhaps
to
inspire
these
worn
and
discouraged
women
with
a
particle
of
her
own
enterprise
perchance
they
altogether
lacked
ability
to
manage
a
school
for
even
the
youngest
children
she
did
not
press
the
subject
it
might
come
up
on
another
occasion
virginia
begged
for
time
to
think
it
over
then
remembering
her
invalid
sister
felt
that
she
must
not
prolong
the
visit
take
some
of
these
flowers
said
miss
nunn
collecting
a
rich
nosegay
from
the
vases
them
be
my
message
to
your
sister
and
i
should
be
so
glad
to
see
monica
sunday
is
a
good
time
i
am
always
at
home
in
the
afternoon
with
a
fluttering
heart
virginia
made
what
haste
she
could
homewards
the
interview
had
filled
her
with
a
turmoil
of
strange
new
thoughts
which
she
was
impatient
to
pour
forth
for
alice
wondering
comment
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
spoken
with
a
woman
daring
enough
to
think
and
act
for
herself
chapter
iv
monica
majority
in
the
drapery
establishment
where
monica
madden
worked
and
lived
it
was
not
as
is
sometimes
the
case
positively
forbidden
to
the
resident
employees
to
remain
at
home
on
sunday
but
they
were
strongly
recommended
to
make
the
utmost
possible
use
of
that
weekly
vacation
herein
no
doubt
appeared
a
laudable
regard
for
their
health
young
people
especially
young
women
who
are
laboriously
engaged
in
a
shop
for
thirteen
hours
and
a
half
every
weekday
and
on
saturday
for
an
average
of
sixteen
may
be
supposed
to
need
a
sabbath
of
open
air
scotcher
and
acted
like
conscientious
men
in
driving
them
forth
immediately
after
breakfast
and
enjoining
upon
them
not
to
return
until
bedtime
by
way
of
constraint
it
was
directed
that
only
the
very
scantiest
meals
plain
bread
and
cheese
in
fact
should
be
supplied
to
those
who
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
holiday
scotcher
and
were
men
not
only
did
they
insist
that
the
sunday
ought
to
be
used
for
bodily
recreation
but
they
had
no
objection
whatever
to
their
young
friends
taking
a
stroll
after
each
evening
nay
so
generous
and
confiding
were
they
that
to
each
young
person
they
allowed
a
latchkey
the
air
of
walworth
road
is
pure
and
invigorating
about
midnight
why
should
the
reposeful
ramble
be
hurried
by
consideration
for
weary
domestics
monica
always
felt
too
tired
to
walk
after
ten
moreover
the
usual
conversation
in
the
dormitory
which
she
shared
with
five
other
young
women
was
so
little
to
her
taste
that
she
wished
to
be
asleep
when
the
talkers
came
up
to
bed
but
on
sunday
she
gladly
followed
the
counsel
of
her
employers
if
the
weather
were
bad
the
little
room
at
lavender
hill
offered
her
a
retreat
when
the
sun
shone
she
liked
to
spend
a
part
of
the
day
in
free
wandering
about
london
which
even
yet
had
not
quite
disillusioned
her
and
it
shone
brightly
this
was
her
birthday
the
completion
of
her
year
alice
and
virginia
of
course
expected
her
early
in
the
morning
and
of
course
they
were
all
to
dine
together
at
the
table
measuring
three
feet
by
one
and
a
half
but
the
afternoon
and
evening
she
must
have
to
herself
the
afternoon
because
a
few
hours
of
her
sisters
talk
invariably
depressed
her
and
the
evening
because
she
had
an
appointment
to
keep
as
she
left
the
big
ugly
her
heart
beat
cheerfully
and
a
smile
fluttered
about
her
lips
she
did
not
feel
very
well
but
that
was
a
matter
of
course
the
ride
in
an
omnibus
would
perhaps
make
her
head
clearer
monica
face
was
of
a
recognized
type
of
prettiness
a
pure
oval
from
the
smooth
forehead
to
the
dimpled
little
chin
all
its
lines
were
soft
and
graceful
her
lack
of
colour
by
heightening
the
effect
of
black
eyebrows
and
darkly
lustrous
eyes
gave
her
at
present
a
more
spiritual
cast
than
her
character
justified
but
a
thoughtful
firmness
was
native
to
her
lips
and
no
possibility
of
smirk
or
simper
lurked
in
the
attractive
features
the
slim
figure
was
well
fitted
in
a
costume
of
pale
blue
cheap
but
becoming
a
modest
little
hat
rested
on
her
black
hair
her
gloves
and
her
sunshade
completed
the
dainty
picture
an
omnibus
would
be
met
in
kennington
park
road
on
her
way
thither
in
a
quiet
she
was
overtaken
by
a
young
man
who
had
left
the
house
of
business
a
moment
after
her
and
had
followed
at
a
short
distance
timidly
a
young
man
of
unhealthy
countenance
with
a
red
pimple
on
the
side
of
his
nose
but
not
otherwise
he
was
clad
with
propriety
hat
diagonal
frockcoat
grey
trousers
and
he
walked
with
a
springy
gait
madden
he
had
ventured
with
perturbation
in
his
face
to
overtake
monica
she
stopped
is
it
mr
bullivant
her
tone
was
far
from
encouraging
but
the
young
man
smiled
upon
her
with
timorous
tenderness
a
beautiful
morning
are
you
going
far
he
had
the
cockney
accent
but
not
in
an
offensive
degree
his
manners
were
not
flagrantly
of
the
shop
some
distance
monica
walked
slowly
on
you
allow
me
to
walk
a
little
way
with
you
he
pleaded
bending
towards
her
shall
take
the
omnibus
at
the
end
of
this
street
they
went
forward
together
monica
no
longer
smiled
but
neither
did
she
look
angry
her
expression
was
one
of
trouble
shall
spend
the
day
mr
bullivant
she
asked
at
length
with
an
effort
to
seem
unconcerned
really
do
know
should
think
it
would
be
very
nice
up
the
river
and
she
added
diffidently
eade
is
going
to
richmond
she
he
replied
vaguely
least
she
wished
to
go
if
she
could
find
a
companion
hope
she
will
enjoy
herself
said
bullivant
with
careful
civility
of
course
she
wo
enjoy
it
very
much
if
she
has
to
go
alone
as
you
have
no
particular
engagement
bullivant
would
it
be
kind
to
the
suggestion
was
incomplete
but
intelligible
could
ask
miss
eade
to
let
me
accompany
her
said
the
young
man
gravely
i
think
you
could
she
would
like
it
monica
looked
rather
frightened
at
her
boldness
and
quickly
added
i
must
say
there
comes
the
bus
bullivant
turned
desperately
in
that
direction
he
saw
there
was
as
yet
no
inside
passenger
allow
me
to
go
a
short
way
with
you
burst
from
his
lips
positively
do
know
how
i
shall
spend
the
morning
monica
had
signalled
to
the
driver
and
was
hurrying
forward
bullivant
followed
reckless
of
consequences
in
a
minute
both
were
seated
within
will
forgive
me
pleaded
the
young
fellow
remarking
a
look
of
serious
irritation
on
his
companion
face
must
be
with
you
a
few
minutes
longer
think
when
i
have
begged
you
not
to
know
how
bad
my
behaviour
must
seem
but
miss
madden
may
i
not
be
on
terms
of
friendship
with
you
course
you
may
but
you
are
not
content
with
that
indeed
i
be
content
foolish
to
say
so
have
you
broken
the
understanding
three
or
four
times
the
bus
stopped
for
a
passenger
a
man
who
mounted
to
the
top
am
so
sorry
murmured
bullivant
as
the
starting
horses
jolted
them
together
try
not
to
worry
you
think
of
my
position
you
have
told
me
that
there
is
no
one
else
who
whose
rights
i
ought
to
respect
feeling
as
i
do
it
is
in
human
nature
to
give
up
hope
will
you
let
me
ask
you
a
rude
question
me
question
miss
madden
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
support
a
wife
she
flushed
and
smiled
bullivant
dreadfully
discomposed
did
not
move
his
eyes
from
her
would
be
possible
for
some
time
he
answered
in
a
thick
voice
have
nothing
but
my
wretched
salary
but
every
one
hopes
reasonable
hope
have
you
monica
urged
forcing
herself
to
be
cruel
because
it
seemed
the
only
way
of
putting
an
end
to
this
situation
there
are
so
many
opportunities
in
our
business
i
could
point
to
half
a
dozen
successful
men
who
were
at
the
counter
a
few
years
ago
i
may
become
a
walker
and
get
at
least
three
pounds
a
week
if
i
were
lucky
enough
to
be
taken
on
as
a
buyer
i
might
make
why
some
make
many
hundreds
a
year
many
hundreds
you
would
ask
me
to
wait
on
and
on
for
one
of
these
wonderful
chances
i
could
move
your
feelings
miss
madden
he
began
with
a
certain
dolorous
dignity
but
there
his
voice
broke
he
saw
too
plainly
that
the
girl
had
neither
faith
in
him
nor
liking
for
him
bullivant
i
think
you
ought
to
wait
until
you
really
have
prospects
if
you
were
encouraged
by
some
person
it
would
be
a
different
thing
and
indeed
you
have
to
look
far
but
where
there
has
never
been
the
slightest
encouragement
you
are
really
wrong
to
act
in
this
way
a
long
engagement
where
everything
remains
doubtful
for
years
is
so
wretched
that
oh
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
try
to
persuade
a
girl
into
that
i
think
it
wrong
and
cruel
the
stroke
was
effectual
bullivant
averted
his
face
naturally
woebegone
and
sat
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
the
bus
again
drew
up
four
or
five
people
were
about
to
ascend
will
say
miss
madden
he
whispered
hurriedly
she
gave
her
hand
glanced
at
him
with
embarrassment
and
so
let
him
depart
ten
minutes
restored
the
mood
in
which
she
had
set
out
once
more
she
smiled
to
herself
indeed
her
head
was
better
for
the
fresh
air
and
the
movement
if
only
the
sisters
would
allow
her
to
get
away
soon
after
dinner
it
was
virginia
who
opened
the
door
to
her
and
embraced
and
kissed
her
with
wonted
fondness
are
nice
and
early
poor
alice
has
been
in
bed
since
the
day
before
yesterday
a
dreadful
cold
and
one
of
her
very
worst
headaches
but
i
think
she
is
a
little
better
this
morning
alice
a
sad
spectacle
was
propped
up
on
pillows
kiss
me
darling
she
said
in
a
voice
barely
audible
must
risk
getting
a
sore
throat
how
well
you
look
afraid
she
does
look
corrected
virginia
perhaps
she
has
a
little
more
colour
than
of
late
monica
dear
as
alice
can
hardly
use
her
voice
i
will
speak
for
both
of
us
and
wish
you
many
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
we
ask
you
to
accept
this
little
book
from
us
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
you
from
time
to
time
are
good
kind
dears
replied
monica
kissing
the
one
on
the
lips
and
the
other
on
her
head
no
use
saying
you
ought
to
have
spent
money
on
me
you
always
do
it
what
a
nice
christian
year
i
do
my
best
to
read
some
of
it
now
and
then
with
a
air
virginia
then
brought
from
some
corner
of
the
room
a
very
small
but
delicate
currant
cake
monica
must
eat
a
mouthful
of
this
she
always
had
such
a
wretched
breakfast
and
the
journey
from
walworth
road
was
enough
to
give
an
appetite
you
are
ruining
yourselves
foolish
people
the
others
exchanged
a
look
and
smiled
with
such
a
strange
air
that
monica
could
not
but
notice
it
know
she
cried
good
news
you
have
found
something
and
better
than
usual
virgie
so
who
knows
eat
your
slice
of
cake
like
a
good
child
and
then
i
shall
have
something
to
tell
you
obviously
the
two
were
excited
virginia
moved
about
with
the
recovered
step
of
girlhood
held
herself
upright
and
could
not
steady
her
hands
would
never
guess
whom
i
have
seen
she
began
when
monica
was
quite
ready
to
listen
had
a
letter
the
other
morning
which
did
puzzle
us
so
i
mean
the
writing
before
we
opened
it
and
it
was
from
miss
nunn
this
name
did
not
greatly
stir
monica
had
quite
lost
sight
of
her
had
you
she
remarked
i
did
suppose
we
should
ever
hear
of
her
again
but
nothing
more
fortunate
could
have
happened
my
dear
she
is
wonderful
at
considerable
length
virginia
detailed
all
she
had
learnt
of
miss
nunn
career
and
described
her
present
position
will
be
the
most
valuable
friend
to
us
oh
her
strength
her
resolution
the
way
in
which
she
discovers
the
right
thing
to
do
you
are
to
call
upon
her
as
soon
as
possible
this
very
after
noon
you
had
better
go
she
will
relieve
you
from
all
your
troubles
darling
her
friend
miss
barfoot
will
teach
you
typewriting
and
put
you
in
the
way
of
earning
an
easy
and
pleasant
livelihood
she
will
indeed
how
long
does
it
take
asked
the
astonished
girl
quite
a
short
time
i
should
think
we
did
speak
of
details
they
were
postponed
you
will
hear
everything
yourself
and
she
suggested
all
sorts
of
ways
pursued
virginia
with
quite
unintentional
exaggeration
which
we
could
make
better
use
of
our
invested
money
she
is
of
practical
expedients
the
most
wonderful
person
she
is
quite
like
a
in
energy
and
resources
i
never
imagined
that
one
of
our
sex
could
resolve
and
plan
and
act
as
she
does
monica
inquired
anxiously
what
the
projects
for
improving
their
income
might
be
is
decided
yet
was
the
reply
given
with
a
confident
smile
us
first
of
all
put
in
comfort
and
security
that
is
the
immediate
need
the
listener
was
interested
but
did
not
show
any
eagerness
for
the
change
proposed
presently
she
stood
at
the
window
and
lost
herself
in
thought
alice
gave
signs
of
an
inclination
to
doze
she
had
had
a
sleepless
night
in
spite
of
soporifics
though
no
sun
entered
the
room
it
was
very
hot
and
the
presence
of
a
third
person
made
the
air
oppressive
you
think
we
might
go
out
for
half
an
hour
monica
whispered
when
virginia
had
pointed
to
the
invalid
closed
eves
sure
very
unhealthy
for
us
all
to
be
in
this
little
place
i
do
like
to
leave
her
the
other
whispered
back
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
have
fresh
air
would
you
like
to
go
to
church
dear
the
bells
have
stopped
yet
the
elder
sisters
were
not
quite
regular
in
their
when
weather
or
lassitude
kept
them
at
home
on
sunday
morning
they
read
the
service
aloud
monica
found
the
duty
of
listening
rather
grievous
during
the
months
that
she
was
alone
in
london
she
had
fallen
into
neglect
of
public
worship
not
from
any
conscious
emancipation
but
because
her
companions
at
the
house
of
business
never
dreamt
of
entering
a
church
and
their
example
by
degrees
affected
her
with
carelessness
at
present
she
was
glad
of
the
pretext
for
escaping
until
she
went
forth
with
the
intention
of
deceiving
her
sisters
of
walking
to
clapham
common
and
on
her
return
inventing
some
sermon
at
a
church
the
others
never
visited
but
before
she
had
gone
many
yards
conscience
overcame
her
was
she
not
getting
to
be
a
very
girl
and
it
was
shameful
to
impose
upon
the
two
after
their
to
her
as
usual
her
little
was
in
her
pocket
she
walked
quickly
to
the
familiar
church
and
reached
it
just
as
the
doors
were
being
closed
of
all
the
congregation
she
probably
was
the
one
who
went
through
the
service
most
mechanically
not
a
word
reached
her
understanding
sitting
standing
or
on
her
knees
she
wore
the
same
preoccupied
look
with
ever
and
again
a
slight
smile
or
a
movement
of
the
lips
as
if
she
were
recalling
some
conversation
of
special
interest
last
sunday
she
had
had
an
adventure
the
first
of
any
real
moment
that
had
befallen
her
in
london
she
had
arranged
to
go
with
miss
eade
on
a
steamboat
up
the
river
they
were
to
meet
at
the
battersea
park
at
two
but
miss
eade
did
not
keep
her
appointment
and
monica
unwilling
to
lose
the
trip
started
alone
she
disembarked
at
richmond
and
strayed
about
for
an
hour
or
two
then
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bun
as
it
was
still
far
too
early
to
return
she
went
down
to
the
riverside
and
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
benches
many
boats
were
going
by
a
majority
of
them
containing
only
two
persons
a
young
man
who
pulled
and
a
girl
who
held
the
strings
of
the
tiller
some
of
these
couples
monica
disregarded
but
occasionally
there
passed
a
skiff
from
which
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
to
lie
back
like
that
on
the
cushions
and
converse
with
a
companion
who
had
nothing
of
the
about
him
it
seemed
hard
that
she
must
be
alone
poor
bullivant
would
gladly
have
taken
her
on
the
river
but
bullivant
she
thought
of
her
sisters
their
loneliness
was
for
life
poor
things
already
they
were
old
and
they
would
grow
older
sadder
perpetually
struggling
to
supplement
that
dividend
from
the
precious
capital
and
merely
that
they
might
keep
alive
oh
her
heart
ached
at
the
misery
of
such
a
prospect
how
much
better
if
the
poor
girls
had
never
been
born
her
own
future
was
more
hopeful
than
theirs
had
ever
been
she
knew
herself
men
had
followed
her
in
the
street
and
tried
to
make
her
acquaintance
some
of
the
girls
with
whom
she
lived
regarded
her
enviously
spitefully
but
had
she
really
the
least
chance
of
marrying
a
man
whom
she
could
respect
not
to
say
love
a
week
hence
at
weston
she
had
kept
tolerable
health
but
certainly
her
constitution
was
not
strong
and
the
slavery
of
walworth
road
threatened
her
with
premature
decay
her
sisters
counselled
wisely
coming
to
london
was
a
mistake
she
would
have
had
better
chances
at
weston
notwithstanding
the
extreme
discretion
with
which
she
was
obliged
to
conduct
herself
while
she
mused
thus
a
profound
discouragement
settling
on
her
sweet
face
some
one
took
a
seat
by
her
on
the
same
bench
that
is
to
say
glancing
aside
she
saw
that
it
was
an
oldish
man
with
grizzled
whiskers
and
rather
a
stern
visage
monica
sighed
was
it
possible
that
he
had
heard
her
he
looked
this
way
and
with
curiosity
ashamed
of
herself
she
kept
her
eyes
averted
for
a
long
time
presently
following
the
movement
of
a
boat
her
face
turned
unconsciously
towards
the
silent
companion
again
he
was
looking
at
her
and
he
spoke
the
gravity
of
his
appearance
and
manner
the
commonplace
that
fell
from
his
lips
could
not
alarm
her
a
dialogue
began
and
went
on
for
about
half
an
hour
how
old
might
he
be
after
all
he
was
probably
not
fifty
perchance
not
much
more
than
forty
his
utterance
fell
short
of
perfect
refinement
but
seemed
that
of
an
educated
man
and
certainly
his
clothes
were
such
as
a
gentleman
wears
he
had
thin
hairy
hands
unmarked
by
any
effect
of
labour
the
nails
could
not
have
been
better
cared
for
was
it
a
bad
sign
that
he
carried
neither
gloves
nor
his
talk
aimed
at
nothing
but
sober
friendliness
it
was
perfectly
inoffensive
indeed
respectful
now
and
then
not
too
often
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
for
an
instant
after
the
introductory
phrases
he
mentioned
that
he
had
had
a
long
drive
alone
his
horse
was
baiting
in
preparation
for
the
journey
back
to
london
he
often
took
such
drives
in
the
summer
though
generally
on
a
weekday
the
magnificent
sky
had
tempted
him
out
this
morning
he
lived
at
herne
hill
at
length
he
ventured
a
question
monica
affected
no
reluctance
to
tell
him
that
she
was
in
a
house
of
business
that
she
had
relatives
in
london
that
only
by
chance
she
found
herself
alone
should
be
sorry
if
i
never
saw
you
again
these
words
he
uttered
with
embarrassment
his
eyes
on
the
ground
monica
could
only
keep
silence
half
an
hour
ago
she
would
not
have
thought
it
possible
for
any
remark
of
this
man
seriously
to
occupy
her
mind
yet
now
she
waited
for
the
next
sentence
in
discomposure
which
was
quite
free
from
resentment
meet
in
this
casual
way
and
talk
and
then
say
why
may
i
tell
you
that
you
interest
me
very
much
and
that
i
am
afraid
to
trust
only
to
chance
for
another
meeting
if
you
were
a
man
he
smiled
should
give
you
my
card
and
ask
you
to
my
house
the
card
i
may
at
all
events
offer
whilst
speaking
he
drew
out
a
little
case
and
laid
a
on
the
bench
within
monica
reach
murmuring
her
you
she
took
the
bit
of
pasteboard
but
did
not
look
at
it
are
on
my
side
of
the
river
he
continued
still
with
scrupulous
modesty
of
tone
i
not
hope
to
see
you
some
day
when
you
are
walking
all
days
and
times
are
the
same
to
me
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
only
on
sunday
that
you
are
at
leisure
only
on
a
sunday
it
took
a
long
time
and
many
circumlocutions
but
in
the
end
an
appointment
was
made
monica
would
see
her
acquaintance
next
sunday
evening
on
the
river
front
of
battersea
park
if
it
rained
then
the
sunday
after
she
was
ashamed
and
confused
other
girls
were
constantly
doing
this
kind
of
thing
other
girls
in
business
but
it
seemed
to
put
her
on
the
level
of
a
servant
and
why
had
she
consented
the
man
could
never
be
anything
to
her
he
was
too
old
too
too
grave
well
on
that
very
account
there
would
be
no
harm
in
meeting
him
in
truth
she
had
not
felt
the
courage
to
refuse
in
a
manner
he
had
overawed
her
and
perhaps
she
would
not
keep
the
engagement
nothing
compelled
her
she
had
not
told
him
her
name
nor
the
house
where
she
was
employed
there
was
a
week
to
think
it
over
all
days
and
times
were
the
same
to
him
he
said
and
he
drove
about
the
country
for
his
pleasure
a
man
of
means
his
name
according
to
the
card
was
edmund
widdowson
he
was
upright
in
his
walk
and
strongly
built
she
noticed
this
as
he
moved
away
from
her
fearful
lest
he
should
turn
round
her
eyes
glanced
at
his
figure
from
moment
to
moment
but
he
did
not
once
look
back
now
to
god
the
father
the
bustle
throughout
the
church
wakened
her
from
reverie
so
complete
that
she
knew
not
a
syllable
of
the
sermon
after
all
she
must
deceive
her
sisters
by
inventing
a
text
and
perhaps
a
comment
by
an
arrangement
with
conisbee
dinner
was
down
in
the
parlour
a
luxurious
meal
moreover
for
in
her
excitement
virginia
had
resolved
to
make
a
feast
of
monica
birthday
there
was
a
tiny
piece
of
salmon
a
dainty
cutlet
and
a
cold
blackcurrant
tart
virginia
at
home
a
constant
vegetarian
took
no
share
of
the
fish
and
meat
which
was
only
enough
for
one
person
alice
alone
upstairs
made
a
dinner
of
gruel
monica
was
to
be
at
queen
road
chelsea
by
three
the
sisters
hoped
she
would
return
to
lavender
hill
with
her
news
but
that
was
left
uncertain
by
monica
herself
purposely
as
an
amusement
she
had
decided
to
keep
her
promise
to
edmund
widdowson
she
was
curious
to
see
him
again
and
receive
a
new
impression
of
his
personality
if
he
behaved
as
inoffensively
as
at
richmond
acquaintance
with
him
might
be
continued
for
the
variety
it
brought
into
her
life
if
anything
unpleasant
happened
she
had
only
to
walk
away
the
slight
very
slight
tremor
of
anticipation
was
reasonably
to
be
prized
by
a
at
scotcher
drawing
near
to
queen
road
the
keble
in
her
hand
she
began
to
wonder
whether
miss
nunn
would
have
any
serious
proposal
to
offer
virginia
report
and
ecstatic
forecasts
were
she
knew
not
completely
trustworthy
though
more
than
ten
years
her
sister
junior
monica
saw
the
world
with
eyes
much
less
disposed
to
magnify
and
colour
ordinary
facts
miss
barfoot
was
still
from
home
rhoda
nunn
received
the
visitor
in
a
pleasant
where
there
was
nothing
costly
nothing
luxurious
yet
to
monica
it
appeared
richly
furnished
a
sense
of
strangeness
amid
such
surroundings
had
more
to
do
with
her
constrained
silence
for
the
first
few
minutes
than
the
difficulty
with
which
she
recognized
in
this
lady
before
her
the
miss
nunn
whom
she
had
known
years
ago
should
never
have
known
you
said
rhoda
equally
surprised
one
thing
you
look
like
a
fever
patient
just
recovering
what
can
be
expected
your
sister
gave
me
a
shocking
account
of
how
you
live
work
is
very
hard
why
do
you
stay
at
such
a
place
monica
am
getting
experience
be
used
in
the
next
world
they
laughed
madden
is
better
i
hope
not
much
i
sorry
to
say
you
tell
me
something
more
about
the
experience
you
are
getting
for
instance
what
time
is
given
you
for
meals
rhoda
nunn
was
not
the
person
to
manufacture
light
gossip
when
a
matter
of
the
gravest
interest
waited
for
discussion
with
a
face
that
expressed
thoughtful
sympathy
she
encouraged
the
girl
to
speak
and
confide
in
her
twenty
minutes
for
each
meal
monica
explained
at
dinner
and
tea
one
is
very
likely
to
be
called
into
the
shop
before
finishing
if
you
are
long
away
you
find
the
table
cleared
arrangement
no
sitting
down
behind
the
counter
i
suppose
of
course
not
we
suffer
a
great
deal
from
that
some
of
us
get
diseases
a
girl
has
just
gone
to
the
hospital
with
varicose
veins
and
two
or
three
others
have
the
same
thing
in
a
less
troublesome
form
sometimes
on
saturday
night
i
lose
all
feeling
in
my
feet
i
have
to
stamp
on
the
floor
to
be
sure
it
still
under
me
that
saturday
night
it
bad
enough
now
but
at
christmas
there
was
a
week
or
more
of
saturday
night
going
on
to
one
in
the
morning
a
girl
by
me
was
twice
carried
out
fainting
one
night
after
another
they
gave
her
brandy
and
she
came
back
again
compelled
her
to
no
it
was
her
own
wish
her
book
of
takings
was
very
good
poor
thing
and
if
it
did
come
up
to
a
certain
figure
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
would
lose
her
place
she
lost
it
after
all
they
told
her
she
was
too
weak
after
christmas
she
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
place
as
a
at
pounds
a
year
at
scotcher
she
had
fifteen
but
we
heard
that
she
burst
a
and
now
she
in
the
hospital
at
brompton
story
have
you
an
day
had
before
i
went
there
but
only
for
about
three
months
then
the
agreement
broke
down
the
assistants
a
pity
the
establishment
does
follow
suit
you
would
say
so
miss
nunn
if
you
knew
how
terribly
hard
it
is
for
many
girls
to
find
a
place
even
now
know
it
perfectly
well
and
i
wish
it
were
harder
i
wish
girls
fell
down
and
died
of
hunger
in
the
streets
instead
of
creeping
to
their
garrets
and
the
hospitals
i
should
like
to
see
their
dead
bodies
collected
together
in
some
open
place
for
the
crowd
to
stare
at
monica
gazed
at
her
with
wide
eyes
mean
i
suppose
that
people
would
try
to
reform
things
knows
perhaps
they
might
only
congratulate
each
other
that
a
few
of
the
superfluous
females
had
been
struck
off
do
they
give
you
any
summer
holiday
week
with
salary
continued
with
salary
continued
that
takes
one
breath
are
many
of
the
girls
ladies
at
scotcher
they
nearly
all
come
from
the
country
several
are
daughters
of
small
farmers
and
those
are
dreadfully
ignorant
one
of
them
asked
me
the
other
day
in
what
country
africa
was
do
find
them
very
pleasant
company
or
two
are
nice
quiet
girls
rhoda
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
moved
with
impatience
do
you
think
you
had
about
enough
of
it
experience
and
all
might
go
into
a
country
business
it
would
be
easier
you
do
care
for
the
thought
wish
now
they
had
brought
me
up
to
something
different
alice
and
virginia
were
afraid
of
having
me
trained
for
a
school
you
remember
that
one
of
our
sisters
who
went
through
it
died
of
overwork
and
not
clever
miss
nunn
i
never
did
much
at
school
rhoda
regarded
her
smiling
gently
have
no
inclination
to
study
now
afraid
not
replied
the
other
looking
away
i
should
like
to
be
better
educated
but
i
do
think
i
could
study
seriously
to
earn
my
living
by
it
the
time
for
that
has
gone
by
so
but
there
are
things
you
might
manage
no
doubt
your
sister
told
you
how
i
get
my
living
there
a
good
deal
of
employment
for
women
who
learn
to
use
a
typewriter
did
you
ever
have
piano
lessons
more
did
i
and
i
was
sorry
for
it
when
i
went
to
typewriting
the
fingers
have
to
be
light
and
supple
and
quick
come
with
me
and
show
you
one
of
the
machines
they
went
to
a
room
downstairs
a
bare
little
room
by
the
library
here
were
two
remingtons
and
rhoda
patiently
explained
their
use
must
practise
until
one
can
do
fifty
words
a
minute
at
least
i
know
one
or
two
people
who
have
reached
almost
twice
that
speed
it
takes
a
good
six
months
work
to
learn
for
any
profitable
use
miss
barfoot
takes
pupils
monica
at
first
very
attentive
was
growing
absent
her
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
the
other
observed
her
closely
and
it
seemed
doubtfully
you
feel
any
impulse
to
try
for
it
should
have
to
live
for
six
months
without
earning
anything
is
by
no
means
impossible
for
you
i
think
really
impossible
monica
replied
with
hesitation
something
like
dissatisfaction
passed
over
miss
nunn
face
though
she
did
not
allow
monica
to
see
it
her
lips
moved
in
a
way
that
perhaps
signified
disdain
for
such
timidity
tolerance
was
not
one
of
the
virtues
expressed
in
her
physiognomy
us
go
back
to
the
and
have
some
tea
monica
could
not
become
quite
at
ease
this
energetic
woman
had
little
attraction
for
her
she
saw
the
characteristics
which
made
virginia
enthusiastic
but
feared
rather
than
admired
them
to
put
herself
in
miss
nunn
hands
might
possibly
result
in
a
worse
form
of
bondage
than
she
suffered
at
the
shop
she
would
never
be
able
to
please
such
a
person
and
failure
she
imagined
would
result
in
more
or
less
contemptuous
dismissal
then
of
a
sudden
as
it
she
had
divined
these
thoughts
rhoda
assumed
an
air
of
gaiety
of
frank
kindness
it
is
your
birthday
i
no
longer
keep
count
of
mine
and
tell
you
without
a
calculation
what
i
am
exactly
it
does
matter
you
see
or
is
much
the
same
for
a
woman
who
has
made
up
her
mind
to
live
alone
and
work
steadily
for
a
definite
object
but
you
are
still
a
young
girl
monica
my
best
wishes
monica
emboldened
herself
to
ask
what
the
object
was
for
which
her
friend
worked
shall
i
put
it
replied
the
other
smiling
make
women
i
think
i
understand
you
mean
that
you
like
to
see
them
live
unmarried
rhoda
laughed
merrily
say
that
almost
with
resentment
indeed
i
did
intend
it
monica
reddened
a
little
more
natural
if
you
have
done
at
your
age
i
should
have
resented
it
the
girl
hesitated
you
approve
of
any
one
marrying
i
not
so
severe
but
do
you
know
that
there
are
half
a
million
more
women
than
men
in
this
happy
country
of
ours
a
million
her
naive
alarm
again
excited
rhoda
to
laughter
like
that
they
say
so
many
women
no
making
a
pair
with
them
the
pessimists
call
them
useless
lost
futile
lives
i
naturally
being
one
of
them
myself
take
another
view
i
look
upon
them
as
a
great
reserve
when
one
woman
vanishes
in
matrimony
the
reserve
offers
a
substitute
for
the
world
work
true
they
are
not
all
trained
yet
far
from
it
i
want
to
help
in
that
to
train
the
reserve
married
woman
are
not
idle
protested
monica
earnestly
all
of
them
some
cook
and
rock
cradles
again
miss
nunn
mood
changed
she
laughed
the
subject
away
and
abruptly
began
to
talk
of
old
days
down
in
somerset
of
rambles
about
cheddar
cliffs
or
at
glastonbury
or
on
the
quantocks
monica
however
could
not
listen
and
with
difficulty
commanded
her
face
to
a
pleasant
smile
you
come
and
see
miss
barfoot
rhoda
asked
when
it
had
become
clear
to
her
that
the
girl
would
gladly
get
away
am
only
her
subordinate
but
i
know
she
will
wish
to
be
of
all
the
use
to
you
she
can
monica
expressed
her
thanks
and
promised
to
act
as
soon
as
possible
on
any
invitation
that
was
sent
her
she
took
leave
just
as
the
servant
announced
another
caller
chapter
v
the
casual
acquaintance
at
that
corner
of
battersea
park
which
is
near
albert
bridge
there
has
lain
for
more
than
twenty
years
a
curious
collection
of
architectural
fragments
chiefly
dismembered
columns
spread
in
order
upon
the
ground
and
looking
like
portions
of
a
razed
temple
it
is
the
colonnade
of
old
burlington
house
conveyed
hither
from
piccadilly
who
knows
why
and
likely
to
rest
here
the
sporting
ground
for
adventurous
infants
until
its
origin
is
lost
in
the
abyss
of
time
it
was
at
this
spot
that
monica
had
agreed
to
meet
with
her
casual
acquaintance
edmund
widdowson
and
there
from
a
distance
she
saw
his
lank
upright
figure
moving
backwards
and
forwards
upon
the
grass
even
at
the
last
moment
monica
doubted
whether
to
approach
emotional
interest
in
him
she
had
none
and
the
knowledge
of
life
she
had
gained
in
london
assured
her
that
in
thus
encouraging
a
perfect
stranger
she
was
doing
a
very
hazardous
thing
but
the
evening
must
somehow
be
spent
and
if
she
went
off
in
another
direction
it
would
only
be
to
wander
about
with
an
adventurous
mind
for
her
conversation
with
miss
nunn
had
had
precisely
the
opposite
effect
of
that
which
rhoda
doubtless
intended
she
felt
something
of
the
recklessness
which
formerly
excited
her
wonder
when
she
remarked
it
in
the
other
she
could
no
longer
be
without
a
male
companion
and
as
she
had
given
her
promise
to
this
man
he
had
seen
her
and
was
coming
forward
today
he
carried
a
and
wore
gloves
otherwise
his
appearance
was
the
same
as
at
richmond
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
he
raised
his
hat
not
very
gracefully
monica
did
not
offer
her
hand
nor
did
widdowson
seem
to
expect
it
but
he
gave
proof
of
an
intense
pleasure
in
the
meeting
his
sallow
cheeks
grew
warm
and
in
the
many
wrinkles
about
his
eyes
played
a
singular
smile
but
anxious
apprehensive
am
so
glad
you
were
able
to
come
he
said
in
a
low
voice
bending
towards
her
has
been
even
finer
than
last
sunday
was
monica
rather
vague
reply
as
she
glanced
at
some
people
who
were
passing
a
wonderful
day
but
i
only
left
home
an
hour
ago
shall
we
walk
this
way
they
went
along
the
path
by
the
river
widdowson
exhibited
none
of
the
artifices
of
gallantry
practised
by
men
who
are
in
the
habit
of
picking
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
smile
did
not
return
an
extreme
sobriety
characterized
his
manner
and
speech
for
the
most
part
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
when
silent
he
had
the
look
of
one
who
inwardly
debates
a
grave
question
you
been
into
the
country
was
one
of
his
first
inquiries
i
spent
the
morning
with
my
sisters
and
in
the
afternoon
i
had
to
see
a
lady
in
chelsea
sisters
are
older
than
yourself
some
years
older
it
long
since
you
went
to
live
apart
from
them
have
never
had
a
home
of
our
own
since
i
was
quite
a
child
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
went
on
to
give
a
brief
account
of
her
history
widdowson
listened
with
the
closest
attention
his
lips
twitching
now
and
then
his
eyes
half
closed
but
for
that
were
too
prominent
and
nostrils
rather
too
large
he
was
not
no
particular
force
of
character
declared
itself
in
his
countenance
and
his
mode
of
speech
did
not
suggest
a
very
active
brain
speculating
again
about
his
age
monica
concluded
that
he
must
be
two
or
three
and
forty
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
grizzled
beard
argued
for
a
higher
figure
he
had
brown
hair
untouched
by
any
sign
of
advanced
life
his
teeth
were
white
and
regular
and
something
she
could
not
make
clear
to
her
mind
exactly
what
convinced
her
that
he
had
a
right
to
judge
himself
comparatively
young
supposed
you
were
not
a
londoner
he
said
when
she
came
to
a
pause
speech
not
he
added
quickly
you
have
any
provincial
accent
and
even
if
you
had
been
a
londoner
you
would
not
have
shown
it
in
that
way
he
seemed
to
be
reproving
himself
for
a
blunder
and
after
a
short
silence
asked
in
a
tone
of
kindness
you
prefer
the
town
some
ways
not
in
all
am
glad
you
have
relatives
here
and
friends
so
many
young
ladies
come
up
from
the
country
who
are
quite
alone
many
their
progress
to
familiarity
could
hardly
have
been
slower
now
and
then
they
spoke
with
a
formal
coldness
which
threatened
absolute
silence
monica
brain
was
so
actively
at
work
that
she
lost
consciousness
of
the
people
who
were
moving
about
them
and
at
times
her
companion
was
scarcely
more
to
her
than
a
voice
they
had
walked
along
the
whole
front
of
the
park
and
were
near
chelsea
bridge
widdowson
gazed
at
the
lying
below
on
the
strand
and
said
diffidently
you
care
to
go
on
the
river
the
proposal
was
so
unexpected
that
monica
looked
up
with
a
startled
air
she
had
not
thought
of
the
man
as
likely
to
offer
any
kind
of
amusement
would
be
pleasant
i
think
he
added
tide
is
still
running
up
we
might
go
very
quietly
for
a
mile
or
two
and
be
back
as
soon
as
you
like
i
should
like
it
he
brightened
up
and
moved
with
a
livelier
step
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
chosen
their
boat
had
pushed
off
and
were
gliding
to
the
middle
of
the
broad
water
widdowson
managed
the
sculls
without
awkwardness
but
by
no
means
like
a
man
well
trained
in
this
form
of
exercise
on
sitting
down
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
stowed
it
away
and
put
on
a
little
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
monica
thought
this
became
him
after
all
he
was
not
a
companion
to
be
ashamed
of
she
looked
with
pleasure
at
his
white
hairy
hands
with
their
firm
grip
then
at
his
boots
very
good
boots
indeed
he
had
gold
links
in
his
white
and
a
gold
chosen
with
a
taste
am
at
your
service
he
said
with
an
approach
to
gaiety
me
shall
we
go
quickly
some
distance
or
only
just
a
little
quicker
than
the
tide
would
float
us
you
like
to
row
much
would
make
you
too
hot
would
like
to
go
some
distance
i
see
no
do
exactly
what
you
like
of
course
we
must
be
back
in
an
hour
or
two
he
drew
out
his
watch
now
ten
minutes
past
six
and
there
is
daylight
till
nine
or
after
when
do
you
wish
to
be
home
much
later
than
nine
monica
answered
with
the
insincerity
of
prudence
we
will
just
go
quietly
along
i
wish
we
could
have
started
early
in
the
afternoon
but
that
may
be
for
another
day
i
hope
on
her
lap
monica
had
the
little
parcel
which
contained
her
present
she
saw
that
widdowson
glanced
at
it
from
time
to
time
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
explain
what
it
was
was
very
much
afraid
that
i
should
not
see
you
he
said
as
they
glided
softly
by
chelsea
embankment
i
promised
to
come
if
it
was
fine
i
feared
something
might
prevent
you
you
are
very
kind
to
give
me
your
company
he
was
looking
at
the
tips
of
her
little
boots
ca
say
how
i
thank
you
much
embarrassed
monica
could
only
gaze
at
one
of
the
sculls
as
it
rose
and
fell
the
water
dripping
from
it
in
bright
beads
year
he
pursued
went
on
the
river
two
or
three
times
but
alone
this
year
i
have
been
in
a
boat
till
prefer
driving
it
only
chance
i
do
drive
a
good
deal
however
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
take
you
through
the
splendid
country
i
saw
a
day
or
two
ago
down
in
surrey
perhaps
some
day
you
will
let
me
i
live
rather
a
lonely
life
as
you
see
i
have
a
housekeeper
no
relative
lives
with
me
my
only
relative
in
london
is
a
and
we
very
seldom
meet
do
you
employ
yourself
in
any
way
very
idle
but
that
partly
because
i
have
worked
very
hard
and
hopelessly
all
my
life
till
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
began
to
earn
my
own
living
when
i
was
fourteen
and
now
i
am
is
your
birthday
said
monica
with
an
odd
look
the
other
could
not
understand
i
only
remembered
it
a
few
hours
ago
strange
that
such
a
treat
should
have
been
provided
for
me
yes
i
am
very
idle
a
year
and
a
half
ago
my
only
brother
died
he
had
been
very
successful
in
life
and
he
left
me
what
i
regard
as
a
fortune
though
it
was
only
a
small
part
of
what
he
had
the
listener
heart
throbbed
without
intending
it
she
pulled
the
tiller
so
that
the
boat
began
to
turn
towards
land
left
hand
a
little
said
widdowson
smiling
correctly
right
many
days
i
do
leave
home
i
am
fond
of
reading
and
now
i
make
up
for
all
the
time
lost
in
years
gone
by
do
you
care
for
books
never
read
very
much
and
i
feel
very
ignorant
that
is
only
for
want
of
opportunity
i
sure
he
glanced
at
the
parcel
acting
on
an
impulse
which
perturbed
her
monica
began
to
slip
off
the
string
and
to
unfold
the
paper
thought
it
was
a
book
exclaimed
widdowson
merrily
when
she
had
revealed
a
part
of
her
present
you
told
me
your
name
said
monica
ought
perhaps
to
have
told
you
mine
it
written
here
my
sisters
gave
me
this
she
offered
the
little
volume
he
took
it
as
though
it
were
something
fragile
and
the
sculls
fixed
under
his
elbows
turned
to
the
it
is
birthday
i
am
you
let
me
shake
hands
with
you
his
pressure
of
her
fingers
was
the
lightest
possible
that
rather
a
strange
thing
is
it
oh
i
remember
this
book
very
well
though
i
have
seen
it
or
heard
of
it
for
twenty
years
my
mother
used
to
read
it
on
sundays
and
it
is
really
your
birthday
i
am
more
than
twice
your
age
miss
madden
the
last
remark
was
uttered
anxiously
mournfully
then
as
if
to
reassure
himself
by
exerting
physical
strength
he
drove
the
boat
along
with
half
a
dozen
vigorous
strokes
monica
was
rustling
over
the
pages
but
without
seeing
them
do
think
said
her
companion
presently
are
very
well
contented
with
your
life
in
that
house
of
business
i
am
not
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
the
hardships
of
such
a
life
will
you
tell
me
something
about
yours
readily
she
gave
him
a
sketch
of
her
existence
from
sunday
to
sunday
but
without
indignation
and
as
if
the
subject
had
no
great
interest
for
her
must
be
very
strong
was
widdowson
comment
lady
i
went
to
see
this
afternoon
told
me
i
looked
course
i
can
see
the
effects
of
overwork
my
wonder
is
that
you
endure
it
at
all
is
that
lady
an
old
acquaintance
monica
answered
with
all
necessary
detail
and
went
on
to
mention
the
proposal
that
had
been
made
to
her
the
hearer
reflected
and
put
further
questions
unwilling
to
speak
of
the
little
capital
she
possessed
monica
told
him
that
her
sisters
might
perhaps
help
her
to
live
whilst
she
was
learning
a
new
occupation
but
widdowson
had
become
abstracted
he
ceased
pulling
crossed
his
arms
on
the
oars
and
watched
other
boats
that
were
near
two
deep
wrinkles
rippling
in
their
course
had
formed
across
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
widened
in
a
gaze
of
complete
abstraction
at
the
farther
shore
fell
from
him
at
length
as
though
in
continuation
of
something
he
had
been
saying
began
to
earn
my
bread
when
i
was
fourteen
my
father
was
an
auctioneer
at
brighton
a
few
years
after
his
marriage
he
had
a
bad
illness
which
left
him
completely
deaf
his
partnership
with
another
man
was
dissolved
and
as
things
went
worse
and
worse
with
him
my
mother
started
a
which
somehow
supported
us
for
a
long
time
she
was
a
sensible
good
and
brave
woman
i
afraid
my
father
had
a
good
many
faults
that
made
her
life
hard
he
was
of
a
violent
temper
and
of
course
the
deafness
did
improve
it
well
one
day
a
cab
knocked
him
down
in
the
king
road
and
from
that
injury
though
not
until
a
year
after
he
died
there
were
only
two
children
i
was
the
elder
my
mother
could
keep
me
at
school
very
long
so
at
fourteen
i
was
sent
into
the
office
of
the
man
who
had
been
my
father
partner
to
serve
him
and
learn
the
business
i
did
serve
him
for
years
and
for
next
to
no
payment
but
he
taught
me
nothing
more
than
he
could
help
he
was
one
of
those
heartless
utterly
selfish
men
that
one
meets
too
often
in
the
business
world
i
ought
never
to
have
been
sent
there
for
my
father
had
always
an
ill
opinion
of
him
but
he
pretended
a
friendly
interest
in
me
just
i
am
convinced
to
make
the
use
of
me
that
he
did
he
was
silent
and
began
rowing
again
happened
them
asked
monica
must
make
out
that
i
was
a
faultless
boy
he
continued
with
the
smile
that
graved
wrinkles
about
his
eyes
the
opposite
i
had
a
good
deal
of
my
father
temper
i
often
behaved
very
badly
to
my
mother
what
i
needed
was
some
stern
but
conscientious
man
to
look
after
me
and
make
me
work
in
my
spare
time
i
lay
about
on
the
shore
or
got
into
mischief
with
other
boys
it
needed
my
mother
death
to
make
a
more
sensible
fellow
of
me
and
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
i
mean
i
was
too
old
to
be
trained
into
profitable
business
habits
up
to
nineteen
i
had
been
little
more
than
an
errand
and
office
boy
and
all
through
the
after
years
i
never
got
a
much
better
position
ca
understand
that
remarked
monica
thoughtfully
not
seem
to
to
be
the
kind
of
man
that
would
make
your
way
i
the
description
pleased
him
he
laughed
cheerfully
i
never
found
what
my
way
was
to
be
i
have
always
hated
office
work
and
business
of
every
kind
yet
i
could
never
see
an
opening
in
any
other
direction
i
have
been
all
my
life
a
clerk
like
so
many
thousands
of
other
men
nowadays
if
i
happen
to
be
in
the
city
when
all
the
clerks
are
coming
away
from
business
i
feel
an
inexpressible
pity
for
them
i
feel
i
should
like
to
find
two
or
three
of
the
hardest
driven
and
just
divide
my
superfluous
income
between
a
clerk
life
a
life
of
the
office
without
any
hope
of
rising
that
is
a
hideous
fate
your
brother
got
on
well
why
did
he
help
you
could
agree
we
always
quarrelled
you
really
so
it
was
asked
in
monica
most
naive
tone
with
a
serious
air
of
investigation
which
at
first
confused
widdowson
then
made
him
laugh
i
was
a
lad
he
replied
have
never
quarrelled
with
any
one
except
my
brother
i
think
it
only
very
unreasonable
people
that
irritate
me
some
men
have
told
me
that
i
was
far
too
too
certainly
i
to
be
but
i
easily
make
friends
as
a
rule
i
ca
talk
to
strangers
i
keep
so
much
to
myself
that
those
who
know
me
only
a
little
think
me
surly
and
unsociable
your
brother
always
refused
to
help
you
was
easy
for
him
to
help
me
he
got
into
a
stockbroker
and
went
on
step
by
step
until
he
had
saved
a
little
money
then
he
speculated
in
all
sorts
of
ways
he
could
employ
me
himself
and
if
he
could
have
done
so
we
should
never
have
got
on
together
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
recommend
me
to
any
one
except
as
a
clerk
he
was
a
born
i
give
you
an
example
of
how
he
grew
rich
in
consequence
of
some
mortgage
business
he
came
into
possession
of
a
field
at
clapham
as
late
as
this
field
brought
him
only
a
rent
of
forty
pounds
it
was
freehold
property
and
he
refused
many
offers
of
purchase
well
in
the
year
before
he
died
the
from
that
field
now
covered
with
houses
were
seven
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
a
year
that
how
men
get
on
who
have
capital
and
know
how
to
use
it
if
had
had
capital
it
would
never
have
yielded
me
more
than
three
or
four
per
cent
i
was
doomed
to
work
for
other
people
who
were
growing
rich
it
does
matter
much
now
except
that
so
many
years
of
life
have
been
lost
your
brother
any
children
children
all
the
same
it
astonished
me
when
i
heard
his
will
i
had
expected
nothing
in
one
day
in
one
hour
i
passed
from
slavery
to
freedom
from
poverty
to
more
than
comfort
we
never
each
other
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
did
it
bring
you
friends
as
well
as
comfort
he
laughed
am
not
so
rich
as
to
have
people
pressing
for
my
acquaintance
i
have
only
about
six
hundred
a
year
monica
drew
in
her
breath
silently
then
gazed
at
the
distance
i
have
made
any
new
friends
the
one
or
two
men
i
care
for
are
not
much
better
off
than
i
used
to
be
and
i
always
feel
ashamed
to
ask
them
to
come
and
see
me
perhaps
they
think
i
shun
them
because
of
their
position
and
i
do
know
how
to
justify
myself
life
has
always
been
full
of
worrying
problems
for
me
i
ca
take
things
in
the
simple
way
that
comes
natural
to
other
men
you
think
we
ought
to
be
turning
back
mr
widdowson
we
will
i
am
sorry
the
time
goes
so
quickly
when
a
few
minutes
had
passed
in
silence
he
asked
you
feel
that
i
am
no
longer
quite
a
stranger
to
you
miss
madden
you
have
told
me
so
much
very
kind
of
you
to
listen
so
patiently
i
wish
i
had
more
interesting
things
to
tell
but
you
see
what
a
dull
life
mine
has
been
he
paused
and
let
the
boat
waver
on
the
stream
for
a
moment
i
dared
to
speak
to
you
last
sunday
i
had
only
the
faintest
hope
that
you
would
grant
me
your
acquaintance
you
ca
i
am
sure
repent
of
having
done
me
that
kindness
never
knows
i
doubted
whether
i
ought
to
talk
with
a
stranger
quite
rightly
it
was
my
perseverance
you
saw
i
hope
that
i
could
never
dream
of
giving
you
offence
the
rule
is
necessary
but
you
see
there
may
be
exceptional
cases
he
was
giving
a
lazy
stroke
now
and
then
which
as
the
tide
was
still
just
moved
the
boat
onwards
saw
something
in
your
face
that
me
to
speak
to
you
and
now
we
may
really
be
friends
i
hope
i
can
think
of
you
as
a
friend
mr
widdowson
a
large
boat
was
passing
with
four
or
five
young
men
and
girls
who
sang
in
good
time
and
tune
only
a
song
of
the
or
of
the
nigger
minstrels
but
it
sounded
pleasantly
with
the
plash
of
the
oars
a
fine
sunset
had
begun
to
glow
upon
the
river
its
warmth
gave
a
tone
to
monica
thin
cheeks
you
will
let
me
see
you
again
before
long
let
me
drive
you
to
hampton
court
next
sunday
or
any
other
place
you
would
choose
likely
i
shall
be
invited
to
my
friend
in
chelsea
you
seriously
think
of
leaving
the
shop
do
know
i
must
have
time
to
think
about
it
yes
but
if
i
write
a
line
to
you
say
on
friday
would
you
let
me
know
whether
you
can
come
to
let
me
refuse
for
next
sunday
the
one
after
perhaps
he
bent
his
head
looked
desperately
grave
and
drove
the
boat
on
monica
was
disturbed
but
held
to
her
resolution
which
widdowson
silently
accepted
the
rest
of
the
way
they
exchanged
only
brief
sentences
about
the
beauty
of
the
sky
the
scenes
on
river
or
bank
and
other
impersonal
matters
after
landing
they
walked
in
silence
towards
chelsea
bridge
i
must
go
quickly
home
said
monica
how
train
from
york
road
to
walworth
road
widdowson
cast
a
curious
glance
at
her
one
would
have
imagined
that
he
found
something
to
disapprove
in
this
ready
knowledge
of
london
transit
will
go
with
you
to
the
station
then
without
a
word
spoken
they
walked
the
short
distance
to
york
road
monica
took
her
ticket
and
offered
a
hand
for
may
write
to
you
said
widdowson
his
face
set
in
an
expression
of
anxiety
make
an
appointment
if
possible
for
the
sunday
after
next
shall
be
glad
to
come
if
i
can
will
be
a
very
long
time
to
me
with
a
faint
smile
monica
hurried
away
to
the
platform
in
the
train
she
looked
like
one
whose
mind
is
occupied
with
grave
trouble
fatigue
had
suddenly
overcome
her
she
leaned
back
and
closed
her
eyes
at
a
street
corner
very
near
to
scotcher
establishment
she
was
intercepted
by
a
tall
rather
girl
who
seemed
to
have
been
loitering
about
it
was
miss
eade
want
to
speak
to
you
miss
madden
where
did
you
go
with
bullivant
this
morning
the
voice
could
not
have
been
more
distinctive
of
a
london
its
tone
signified
irritation
bullivant
i
went
nowhere
with
him
i
you
both
get
into
the
bus
in
kennington
park
road
you
monica
returned
coldly
ca
help
it
if
bullivant
happened
to
be
going
the
same
way
very
well
i
thought
you
was
to
be
trusted
it
nothing
to
me
behave
very
foolishly
miss
eade
exclaimed
the
other
whose
nerves
at
this
moment
would
not
allow
her
to
use
patience
with
the
jealous
girl
can
only
tell
you
that
i
have
never
thought
again
of
bullivant
since
he
left
the
bus
somewhere
in
clapham
road
tired
of
talking
about
such
things
see
here
do
be
cross
come
and
walk
a
bit
and
tell
me
too
tired
and
there
nothing
whatever
to
tell
you
well
if
you
going
to
be
narsty
monica
walked
on
but
the
girl
caught
her
up
be
so
sharp
with
me
miss
madden
i
do
say
as
you
wanted
him
to
go
in
the
bus
with
you
but
you
might
tell
me
what
he
had
to
say
at
all
except
that
he
wished
to
know
where
i
was
going
which
was
no
business
of
his
i
did
what
i
could
for
you
i
told
him
that
if
he
asked
you
to
go
up
the
river
with
him
i
felt
sure
you
refuse
you
did
miss
eade
threw
up
her
head
do
think
it
was
a
very
delicate
thing
to
say
are
very
unreasonable
i
myself
do
think
it
was
very
delicate
but
have
you
worried
me
to
say
something
of
the
kind
that
i
sure
i
have
worrited
you
indeed
please
never
to
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
again
i
tired
of
it
what
did
say
when
you
said
that
ca
remember
you
narsty
really
you
are
if
it
had
been
the
other
way
about
i
never
have
treated
like
this
that
i
would
they
were
close
to
the
door
by
which
scotcher
resident
employees
entered
at
night
monica
had
taken
out
her
latchkey
but
miss
eade
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
left
in
torturing
ignorance
tell
me
she
whispered
do
anything
for
you
i
can
be
unkind
miss
madden
monica
turned
back
again
i
were
you
i
would
be
so
silly
i
ca
do
more
than
assure
you
and
promise
you
that
i
shall
never
listen
to
mr
bullivant
what
did
he
say
about
dear
miss
eade
kept
a
mortified
silence
had
much
better
not
think
of
him
at
all
i
would
have
more
pride
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
him
as
i
do
you
did
really
speak
about
me
oh
i
do
wish
you
find
some
one
to
go
out
with
then
perhaps
monica
stood
still
hesitated
and
at
length
said
i
found
some
one
have
the
girl
all
but
danced
with
joy
really
have
so
now
do
trouble
me
any
more
this
time
she
was
allowed
to
turn
back
and
enter
the
house
no
one
else
had
yet
come
in
monica
ate
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
cheese
which
was
in
readiness
on
the
long
table
down
in
the
basement
and
at
once
went
to
bed
but
no
welcome
drowsiness
fell
upon
her
at
eleven
when
two
of
the
other
five
girls
who
slept
in
the
room
made
their
appearance
she
was
still
changing
uneasily
from
side
to
side
they
lit
the
gas
it
was
not
turned
off
till
midnight
after
which
hour
the
late
arrivals
had
to
use
a
candle
of
their
own
procuring
and
began
a
lively
conversation
on
the
events
of
the
day
afraid
of
being
obliged
to
talk
monica
feigned
sleep
at
twelve
just
as
the
gas
went
out
another
pair
came
to
repose
they
had
been
quarrelling
and
were
very
gloomy
after
a
long
and
acrimonious
discussion
in
the
dark
as
to
which
of
them
should
find
a
candle
it
ended
in
one
of
the
girls
who
was
in
bed
impatiently
supplying
a
light
they
began
sullenly
to
throw
off
their
garments
miss
madden
awake
said
one
of
them
looking
in
monica
direction
there
was
no
reply
picked
up
some
feller
continued
the
speaker
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
round
at
her
companions
with
a
grin
else
she
had
him
all
along
i
should
wonder
heads
were
put
forward
eagerly
and
inquiries
whispered
oldish
i
should
say
i
caught
sight
of
them
just
as
they
was
going
off
in
a
boat
from
battersea
park
but
i
could
see
his
face
very
well
he
looked
rather
like
mr
thomas
thomas
was
a
member
of
the
drapery
firm
a
man
of
fifty
ugly
and
austere
at
this
description
the
listeners
giggled
and
uttered
exclamations
he
a
swell
asked
one
wonder
if
he
was
you
can
trust
miss
to
keep
her
eyes
open
she
one
of
the
sly
and
quiet
is
she
murmured
another
enviously
just
one
of
those
as
gets
made
a
fool
of
that
opinion
the
point
was
argued
for
some
minutes
it
led
to
talk
about
miss
eade
who
was
treated
with
frank
contempt
because
of
her
pursuit
of
a
mere
these
other
damsels
had
at
present
more
exalted
views
for
they
were
all
younger
than
miss
eade
just
before
one
when
silence
had
reigned
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
entered
with
much
bustle
the
last
occupant
of
the
bedroom
she
was
a
young
woman
with
a
morally
unenviable
reputation
though
some
of
her
colleagues
certainly
envied
her
money
came
to
her
with
remarkable
readiness
whenever
she
had
need
of
it
as
usual
she
began
to
talk
very
loud
at
first
with
innocent
vulgarity
exciting
a
little
laughter
she
became
anecdotic
and
very
scandalous
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
disrobe
and
when
the
candle
was
out
she
still
had
her
richest
story
to
relate
of
point
so
rabelaisian
that
one
or
two
voices
made
themselves
heard
in
serious
protest
the
gifted
anecdotist
replied
with
a
long
laugh
then
cried
young
ladies
and
sank
peacefully
to
slumber
as
for
monica
she
saw
the
white
dawn
peep
at
the
window
and
closed
her
eyes
only
when
the
life
of
a
new
week
had
begun
noisily
in
walworth
road
chapter
vi
a
camp
of
the
reserve
in
consequence
of
letters
exchanged
during
the
week
next
sunday
brought
the
three
miss
maddens
to
queen
road
to
lunch
with
miss
barfoot
alice
had
recovered
from
her
cold
but
was
still
ailing
and
took
rather
a
gloomy
view
of
the
situation
she
had
lately
reviewed
with
such
courage
virginia
maintained
her
enthusiastic
faith
in
miss
nunn
and
was
prepared
to
reverence
miss
barfoot
with
hardly
less
fervour
both
of
them
found
it
difficult
to
understand
their
young
sister
who
in
her
letters
had
betrayed
distaste
for
the
change
of
career
proposed
to
her
they
were
received
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
all
greatly
enjoyed
their
afternoon
for
not
even
monica
prejudice
against
a
house
which
in
her
own
mind
she
had
stigmatized
as
factory
could
resist
the
charm
of
the
hostess
though
miss
barfoot
had
something
less
than
a
woman
average
stature
the
note
of
her
presence
was
personal
dignity
she
was
handsome
and
her
carriage
occasionally
betrayed
a
consciousness
of
the
fact
according
to
circumstances
she
bore
herself
as
the
lady
of
aristocratic
tastes
as
a
genial
woman
of
the
world
or
as
a
fervid
prophetess
of
female
emancipation
and
each
character
was
supported
with
a
spontaneity
a
confidence
which
inspired
liking
and
respect
a
brilliant
complexion
and
eyes
that
sparkled
with
habitual
cheerfulness
gave
her
the
benefit
of
doubt
when
her
age
was
in
question
her
style
of
dress
gracefully
ornate
would
have
led
a
stranger
to
presume
her
a
wedded
lady
of
some
distinction
yet
mary
barfoot
had
known
many
troubles
poverty
among
them
her
experiences
and
struggles
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
those
which
rhoda
nunn
had
gone
through
and
the
time
of
trial
had
lasted
longer
mental
and
moral
stamina
would
have
assured
her
against
such
evils
of
celibacy
as
appeared
in
the
elder
maddens
but
it
was
to
a
change
of
worldly
fortune
that
she
owed
this
revival
of
youthful
spirit
and
energy
in
middle
life
and
i
must
be
friends
she
said
to
monica
holding
the
soft
little
hand
are
both
black
but
comely
the
compliment
to
herself
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
monica
blushed
with
pleasure
and
could
not
help
laughing
it
was
all
but
decided
that
monica
should
become
a
pupil
at
the
school
in
great
portland
street
in
a
brief
private
conversation
miss
barfoot
offered
to
lend
her
the
money
that
might
be
needful
but
a
business
transaction
miss
madden
you
can
give
me
security
you
will
repay
me
at
your
convenience
if
in
the
end
this
occupation
does
please
you
you
will
at
all
events
have
regained
health
it
is
clear
to
me
that
you
must
go
on
in
that
dreadful
place
you
described
to
miss
nunn
the
visitors
took
their
leave
at
about
five
things
poor
things
sighed
miss
barfoot
when
she
was
alone
with
her
friend
can
we
possibly
do
for
the
older
ones
are
excellent
creatures
said
rhoda
innocent
women
but
useful
for
nothing
except
what
they
have
done
all
their
lives
the
eldest
ca
teach
seriously
but
she
can
keep
young
children
out
of
mischief
and
give
them
a
nice
way
of
speaking
her
health
is
breaking
down
you
can
see
woman
one
of
the
saddest
types
virginia
is
quite
so
depressing
but
how
childish
all
strike
me
as
childish
monica
is
a
dear
little
girl
it
seemed
a
great
absurdity
to
talk
to
her
about
business
of
course
she
must
find
a
husband
suppose
so
rhoda
tone
of
slighting
concession
amused
her
companion
dear
after
all
we
do
desire
the
end
of
the
race
i
suppose
not
rhoda
admitted
with
a
laugh
word
of
caution
your
zeal
is
eating
you
up
at
this
rate
you
will
hinder
our
purpose
we
have
no
mission
to
prevent
girls
from
marrying
suitably
only
to
see
that
those
who
ca
shall
have
a
means
of
living
with
some
satisfaction
chance
is
there
that
this
girl
will
marry
suitably
who
knows
at
all
events
there
will
be
more
likelihood
of
it
if
she
comes
into
our
sphere
do
you
know
any
man
that
would
dream
of
marrying
her
not
at
present
it
was
clear
that
miss
barfoot
stood
in
some
danger
of
becoming
subordinate
to
her
more
vehement
friend
her
little
body
for
all
its
natural
dignity
put
her
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
presence
of
rhoda
who
towered
above
her
with
rather
imperious
stateliness
her
suavity
was
no
match
for
rhoda
vigorous
abruptness
but
the
two
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
by
this
time
thought
themselves
able
safely
to
dispense
with
the
forms
at
first
imposed
by
their
mutual
relations
she
marry
at
all
declared
miss
nunn
will
marry
badly
the
family
is
branded
they
belong
to
the
class
we
know
so
well
with
no
social
position
and
unable
to
win
an
individual
one
i
must
find
a
name
for
that
ragged
regiment
miss
barfoot
regarded
her
friend
thoughtfully
what
comfort
have
you
for
the
poor
in
spirit
whatever
i
afraid
my
mission
is
not
to
them
after
a
pause
she
added
have
their
religious
faith
i
suppose
and
it
answerable
for
a
good
deal
would
be
a
terrible
responsibility
to
rob
them
of
it
remarked
the
elder
woman
gravely
rhoda
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
a
terrible
responsibility
to
do
anything
at
all
but
glad
she
laughed
scornfully
it
not
my
task
to
release
them
mary
barfoot
mused
a
compassionate
shadow
on
her
fine
face
do
think
we
can
do
without
the
spirit
of
that
religion
she
said
at
length
essential
human
spirit
these
poor
women
one
ought
to
be
very
tender
with
them
i
do
like
your
ragged
regiment
phrase
when
i
grow
old
and
melancholy
i
think
i
shall
devote
myself
to
poor
hopeless
and
purposeless
women
try
to
warm
their
hearts
a
little
before
they
go
hence
murmured
rhoda
smiling
in
the
meantime
they
cumber
us
we
have
to
fight
she
threw
forward
her
arms
as
though
with
spear
and
buckler
miss
barfoot
was
smiling
at
this
palladin
attitude
when
a
servant
announced
two
ladies
smallbrook
and
miss
haven
they
were
aunt
and
niece
the
former
a
tall
ungainly
widow
the
latter
a
gentle
girl
of
am
so
glad
you
are
back
again
exclaimed
the
widow
as
she
shook
hands
with
miss
barfoot
speaking
in
a
hard
unsympathetic
voice
do
so
want
to
ask
your
advice
about
an
interesting
girl
who
has
applied
to
me
i
afraid
her
past
wo
bear
looking
into
but
most
certainly
she
is
a
reformed
character
winifred
is
most
favourably
impressed
with
her
miss
haven
the
winifred
in
question
began
to
talk
apart
with
rhoda
nunn
do
wish
my
aunt
would
exaggerate
so
she
said
in
a
subdued
voice
whilst
smallbrook
still
talked
loudly
and
urgently
never
said
that
i
was
favourably
impressed
the
girl
protests
far
too
much
she
has
played
on
aunt
weaknesses
i
fear
who
is
she
some
one
who
lost
her
character
long
ago
and
lives
i
should
say
on
charitable
people
just
because
i
said
that
she
must
once
have
had
a
very
nice
face
aunt
misrepresents
me
in
this
way
it
too
bad
she
an
educated
person
miss
barfoot
was
heard
to
ask
precisely
well
educated
the
lower
classes
then
do
like
that
term
you
know
of
the
classes
never
was
a
lady
put
in
miss
haven
quietly
but
decidedly
i
fear
i
can
be
of
no
use
said
the
hostess
betraying
some
of
her
secret
satisfaction
in
being
able
thus
to
avoid
request
winifred
a
pupil
at
great
portland
street
was
much
liked
by
both
her
teachers
but
the
aunt
with
her
ceaseless
philanthropy
at
other
people
expense
could
only
be
considered
a
bore
surely
you
do
limit
your
humanity
miss
barfoot
by
the
artificial
divisions
of
society
think
those
divisions
are
anything
but
artificial
replied
the
hostess
the
uneducated
classes
i
have
no
interest
whatever
you
have
heard
me
say
so
but
i
can
not
think
is
that
just
a
little
narrow
so
i
choose
my
sphere
that
all
let
those
work
for
the
lower
classes
i
must
call
them
lower
for
they
are
in
every
sense
let
those
work
for
them
who
have
a
call
to
do
so
i
have
none
i
must
keep
to
my
own
class
surely
miss
nunn
cried
the
widow
turning
to
rhoda
work
for
the
abolition
of
all
unjust
privilege
to
us
is
not
a
woman
a
woman
am
obliged
to
agree
with
miss
barfoot
i
think
that
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
meddle
with
uneducated
people
all
our
schemes
and
views
are
unsettled
we
have
to
learn
a
new
language
for
one
thing
but
your
missionary
enterprise
is
admirable
my
part
declared
smallbrook
aim
at
the
solidarity
of
woman
you
at
all
events
agree
with
me
winifred
really
do
think
aunt
that
there
can
be
any
solidarity
of
ladies
with
servant
girls
responded
miss
haven
encouraged
by
a
look
from
rhoda
i
grieve
that
your
charity
falls
so
far
below
the
christian
standard
miss
barfoot
firmly
guided
the
conversation
to
a
more
hopeful
subject
not
many
people
visited
this
house
every
wednesday
evening
from
eight
to
eleven
miss
barfoot
was
at
home
to
any
of
her
acquaintances
including
her
pupils
who
chose
to
call
upon
her
but
this
was
in
the
nature
of
an
association
with
recognized
objects
of
society
in
the
common
sense
miss
barfoot
saw
very
little
she
had
no
time
to
sacrifice
in
the
pursuit
of
idle
ceremonies
by
the
successive
deaths
of
two
relatives
a
widowed
sister
and
an
uncle
she
had
come
into
possession
of
a
modest
fortune
but
no
thought
of
a
life
such
as
would
have
suggested
itself
to
most
women
in
her
place
ever
tempted
her
her
studies
had
always
been
of
a
very
positive
nature
her
abilities
were
of
a
kind
uncommon
in
women
or
at
all
events
very
rarely
developed
in
one
of
her
sex
she
could
have
managed
a
large
and
complicated
business
could
have
filled
a
place
on
a
board
of
directors
have
taken
an
active
part
in
municipal
government
nay
perchance
in
national
and
this
turn
of
intellect
consisted
with
many
traits
of
character
so
strongly
feminine
that
people
who
knew
her
best
thought
of
her
with
as
much
tenderness
as
admiration
she
did
not
seek
to
become
known
as
the
leader
of
a
yet
her
quiet
work
was
probably
more
effectual
than
the
public
career
of
women
who
propagandize
for
female
emancipation
her
aim
was
to
draw
from
the
overstocked
profession
of
teaching
as
many
capable
young
women
as
she
could
lay
hands
on
and
to
fit
them
for
certain
of
the
pursuits
nowadays
thrown
open
to
their
sex
she
held
the
conviction
that
whatever
man
could
do
woman
could
do
equally
well
those
tasks
only
excepted
which
demand
great
physical
strength
at
her
instance
and
with
help
from
her
purse
two
girls
were
preparing
themselves
to
be
pharmaceutical
chemists
two
others
had
been
aided
by
her
to
open
a
bookseller
shop
and
several
who
had
clerkships
in
view
received
an
admirable
training
at
her
school
in
great
portland
street
thither
every
weekday
morning
miss
barfoot
and
rhoda
repaired
they
arrived
at
nine
and
with
an
hour
interval
work
went
on
until
five
entering
by
the
private
door
of
a
shop
they
ascended
to
the
second
story
where
two
rooms
had
been
furnished
like
comfortable
offices
two
smaller
on
the
floor
above
served
for
in
one
of
the
offices
typewriting
and
occasionally
other
kinds
of
work
that
demanded
intelligence
were
carried
on
by
three
or
four
young
women
regularly
employed
to
superintend
this
department
was
miss
nunn
chief
duty
together
with
business
correspondence
under
the
principal
direction
in
the
second
room
miss
barfoot
instructed
her
pupils
never
more
than
three
being
with
her
at
a
time
a
bookcase
full
of
works
on
the
woman
question
and
allied
topics
served
as
a
circulating
library
volumes
were
lent
without
charge
to
the
members
of
this
little
society
once
a
month
miss
barfoot
or
miss
nunn
by
turns
gave
a
brief
address
on
some
set
subject
the
hour
was
four
and
about
a
dozen
hearers
generally
assembled
both
worked
very
hard
miss
barfoot
did
not
look
upon
her
enterprise
as
a
source
of
pecuniary
profit
but
she
had
made
the
establishment
more
than
her
pupils
increased
in
number
and
the
working
department
promised
occupation
for
a
larger
staff
than
was
at
present
engaged
the
young
women
in
general
answered
their
friend
expectations
but
of
course
there
were
disappointing
instances
one
of
these
had
caused
miss
barfoot
special
distress
a
young
girl
whom
she
had
released
from
a
life
of
much
hardship
and
who
after
a
couple
of
months
trial
bade
fair
to
develop
noteworthy
ability
of
a
sudden
disappeared
she
was
without
relatives
in
london
and
miss
barfoot
endeavours
to
find
her
proved
for
several
weeks
very
futile
then
came
news
of
her
she
was
living
as
the
mistress
of
a
married
man
every
effort
was
made
to
bring
her
back
but
the
girl
resisted
presently
she
again
passed
out
of
sight
and
now
more
than
a
year
had
elapsed
since
miss
barfoot
last
interview
with
her
this
monday
morning
among
letters
delivered
at
the
house
was
one
from
the
strayed
girl
miss
barfoot
read
it
in
private
and
throughout
the
day
remained
unusually
grave
at
five
when
staff
and
pupils
had
all
departed
she
sat
for
a
while
in
meditation
then
spoke
to
rhoda
who
was
glancing
over
a
book
by
the
window
a
letter
i
should
like
you
to
read
that
has
been
troubling
you
since
morning
is
it
rhoda
took
the
sheet
and
quickly
ran
through
its
contents
her
face
hardened
and
she
threw
down
the
letter
with
a
smile
of
contempt
do
you
advise
asked
the
elder
woman
closely
observing
her
answer
in
two
lines
with
a
cheque
enclosed
if
you
see
fit
that
really
meet
the
case
than
meets
it
i
should
say
miss
barfoot
pondered
am
doubtful
that
is
a
letter
of
despair
and
i
ca
close
my
ears
to
it
had
an
affection
for
the
girl
help
her
by
all
means
if
you
feel
compelled
to
but
you
would
hardly
dream
of
taking
her
back
again
the
point
why
should
i
one
thing
replied
rhoda
looking
coldly
down
upon
her
friend
will
never
do
any
good
with
her
for
another
she
is
a
suitable
companion
for
the
girls
she
would
meet
here
ca
be
sure
of
either
objection
she
acted
with
deplorable
rashness
with
infatuation
but
i
never
discovered
any
sign
of
evil
in
her
did
you
well
what
does
the
word
mean
i
am
not
a
puritan
and
i
judge
her
as
the
ordinary
woman
would
but
i
think
she
has
put
herself
altogether
beyond
our
sympathy
she
was
years
old
no
child
and
she
acted
with
her
eyes
open
no
deceit
was
practised
with
her
she
knew
the
man
had
a
wife
and
she
was
base
enough
to
accept
a
share
of
his
attentions
do
you
advocate
polygamy
that
is
an
intelligible
position
i
admit
it
is
one
way
of
meeting
the
social
difficulty
but
not
mine
dear
rhoda
do
enrage
yourself
will
try
not
to
i
ca
see
the
temptation
to
do
so
come
and
sit
down
and
talk
quietly
no
i
have
no
fondness
for
polygamy
i
find
it
very
hard
to
understand
how
she
could
act
as
she
did
but
a
mistake
however
wretched
must
condemn
a
woman
for
life
that
the
way
of
the
world
and
decidedly
it
must
be
ours
this
point
i
practically
agree
with
the
world
see
you
do
and
it
astonishes
me
you
are
going
through
curious
changes
in
several
respects
a
year
ago
you
did
speak
of
her
like
this
because
i
did
know
you
well
enough
to
speak
my
mind
partly
yes
i
have
changed
a
good
deal
no
doubt
but
i
should
never
have
proposed
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
that
is
an
amiable
impulse
but
favourite
word
on
your
lips
just
now
rhoda
why
is
it
one
of
the
supreme
social
needs
of
our
day
is
the
education
of
women
in
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
men
chiefly
but
a
few
women
also
of
a
certain
temperament
who
cry
for
a
reckless
individualism
in
these
matters
they
would
tell
you
that
she
behaved
laudably
that
she
was
out
and
things
of
that
kind
but
i
did
think
you
shared
such
views
do
altogether
the
education
of
women
in
very
well
here
is
a
poor
woman
whose
has
given
way
under
grievous
temptation
circumstances
have
taught
her
that
she
made
a
wild
mistake
the
man
gives
her
up
and
bids
her
live
as
she
can
she
is
reduced
to
beggary
now
in
that
position
a
girl
is
tempted
to
sink
still
further
the
letter
of
two
lines
and
an
enclosed
cheque
would
as
likely
as
not
plunge
her
into
depths
from
which
she
could
never
be
rescued
it
would
assure
her
that
there
was
no
hope
on
the
other
hand
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
attempt
that
very
education
of
which
you
speak
she
has
brains
and
does
belong
to
the
vulgar
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
moved
by
illogical
impulses
and
certainly
anything
but
kind
ones
rhoda
only
grew
more
stubborn
say
she
yielded
to
a
grievous
temptation
what
temptation
will
it
bear
putting
into
words
yes
i
think
it
will
answered
miss
barfoot
with
her
gentlest
smile
fell
in
love
with
the
man
in
love
concentration
of
scorn
was
in
this
echo
for
what
is
that
phrase
responsible
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
which
i
have
never
ventured
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
miss
nunn
strong
features
were
moved
as
if
by
a
suppressed
laugh
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
grew
very
slightly
warm
am
a
normal
human
being
she
answered
with
an
impatient
gesture
understand
perfectly
well
what
the
phrase
signifies
is
no
answer
my
dear
have
you
ever
been
in
love
with
any
man
when
i
was
fifteen
not
since
rejoined
the
other
shaking
her
head
and
smiling
not
since
heaven
no
you
are
not
very
well
able
to
judge
this
case
i
on
the
other
hand
can
judge
it
with
the
very
largest
understanding
do
smile
so
witheringly
rhoda
i
shall
neglect
your
advice
for
once
will
bring
this
girl
back
and
continue
teaching
her
as
before
have
no
one
here
that
knows
her
and
with
prudence
she
need
never
be
talked
about
by
those
of
our
friends
who
did
weak
weak
weak
once
i
must
act
independently
and
at
a
stroke
change
the
whole
character
of
your
work
you
never
proposed
keeping
a
reformatory
your
aim
is
to
help
chosen
girls
who
promise
to
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
this
miss
royston
represents
the
profitless
average
no
she
is
below
the
average
are
you
so
blind
as
to
imagine
that
any
good
will
ever
come
of
such
a
person
if
you
wish
to
save
her
from
the
streets
do
so
by
all
means
but
to
put
her
among
your
chosen
pupils
is
to
threaten
your
whole
undertaking
let
it
once
become
known
and
it
become
known
that
a
girl
of
that
character
came
here
and
your
usefulness
is
at
an
end
in
a
year
time
you
will
have
to
choose
between
giving
up
the
school
altogether
and
making
it
a
refuge
for
outcasts
miss
barfoot
was
silent
she
tapped
with
her
fingers
on
the
table
feeling
is
misleading
you
rhoda
pursued
royston
had
a
certain
cleverness
i
grant
but
do
you
think
i
did
know
that
she
would
never
become
what
you
hoped
all
her
spare
time
was
given
to
if
every
novelist
could
be
strangled
and
thrown
into
the
sea
we
should
have
some
chance
of
reforming
women
the
girl
nature
was
corrupted
with
sentimentality
like
that
of
all
but
every
woman
who
is
intelligent
enough
to
read
what
is
called
the
best
fiction
but
not
intelligent
enough
to
understand
its
vice
love
love
love
a
sickening
sameness
of
vulgarity
what
is
more
vulgar
than
the
ideal
of
novelists
they
wo
represent
the
actual
world
it
would
be
too
dull
for
their
readers
in
real
life
how
many
men
and
women
in
not
one
in
every
ten
thousand
i
am
convinced
not
one
married
pair
in
ten
thousand
have
felt
for
each
other
as
two
or
three
couples
do
in
every
novel
there
is
the
sexual
instinct
of
course
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
the
novelists
dare
talk
about
that
the
paltry
creatures
dare
tell
the
one
truth
that
would
be
profitable
the
result
is
that
women
imagine
themselves
noble
and
glorious
when
they
are
most
near
the
animals
this
miss
royston
when
she
rushed
off
to
perdition
ten
to
one
she
had
in
mind
some
idiot
heroine
of
a
book
oh
i
tell
you
that
you
are
losing
sight
of
your
first
duty
there
are
people
enough
to
act
the
good
samaritan
have
quite
another
task
in
life
it
is
your
work
to
train
and
encourage
girls
in
a
path
as
far
as
possible
from
that
of
the
let
them
marry
later
if
they
must
but
at
all
events
you
will
have
cleared
their
views
on
the
subject
of
marriage
and
put
them
in
a
position
to
judge
the
man
who
offers
himself
you
will
have
taught
them
that
marriage
is
an
alliance
of
intellects
not
a
means
of
support
or
something
more
ignoble
still
but
to
do
this
with
effect
you
must
show
yourself
relentless
to
female
imbecility
if
a
girl
gets
to
know
that
you
have
received
back
such
a
person
as
miss
royston
she
will
be
corrupted
by
your
spirit
of
charity
corrupted
at
all
events
for
our
purposes
the
endeavour
to
give
women
a
new
soul
is
so
difficult
that
we
ca
be
cumbered
by
such
as
fishing
foolish
people
out
of
the
mud
they
have
walked
into
charity
for
human
weakness
is
all
very
well
in
its
place
but
it
is
precisely
one
of
the
virtues
that
you
must
teach
you
have
to
set
an
example
of
the
sterner
qualities
to
discourage
anything
that
resembles
sentimentalism
and
think
if
you
illustrate
in
your
own
behaviour
a
sympathy
for
the
very
vice
of
character
we
are
trying
our
hardest
to
extirpate
is
a
terrible
harangue
said
miss
barfoot
when
the
passionate
voice
had
been
silent
for
a
few
ticks
of
the
clock
quite
enter
into
your
point
of
view
but
i
think
you
go
beyond
practical
zeal
however
i
will
help
the
girl
in
some
other
way
if
possible
have
offended
you
to
take
offence
at
such
obvious
sincerity
surely
you
grant
the
force
of
what
i
say
differ
a
good
deal
rhoda
on
certain
points
which
as
a
rule
would
never
come
up
to
interfere
with
our
working
in
harmony
you
have
come
to
dislike
the
very
thought
of
marriage
and
everything
of
that
kind
i
think
it
a
danger
you
ought
to
have
avoided
true
we
wish
to
prevent
girls
from
marrying
just
for
the
sake
of
being
supported
and
from
degrading
themselves
as
poor
bella
royston
has
done
but
surely
between
ourselves
we
can
admit
that
the
vast
majority
of
women
would
lead
a
wasted
life
if
they
did
not
marry
maintain
that
the
vast
majority
of
women
lead
a
vain
and
miserable
life
because
they
marry
you
blame
the
institution
of
marriage
with
what
is
chargeable
to
human
fate
a
vain
and
miserable
life
is
the
lot
of
nearly
all
mortals
most
women
whether
they
marry
or
not
will
suffer
and
commit
endless
follies
women
as
life
is
at
present
arranged
for
them
things
are
changing
and
we
try
to
have
our
part
in
hastening
a
new
order
we
use
words
in
a
different
sense
i
speak
of
human
nature
not
of
the
effect
of
institutions
it
is
you
who
are
unpractical
those
views
lead
only
to
pessimism
and
paralysis
of
effort
miss
barfoot
rose
give
in
to
your
objection
against
bringing
the
girl
back
to
work
here
i
will
help
her
in
other
ways
it
quite
true
that
she
is
to
be
relied
upon
to
trust
her
in
any
detail
of
life
the
pity
is
that
her
degradation
ca
be
used
as
an
object
lesson
for
our
other
girls
again
we
differ
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
your
ideas
of
how
the
mind
is
influenced
the
misery
of
bella
royston
would
not
in
the
least
affect
any
other
girl
way
of
thinking
about
the
destiny
of
her
sex
we
must
avoid
exaggeration
if
our
friends
get
to
think
of
us
as
fanatics
all
our
usefulness
is
over
the
ideal
we
set
up
must
be
human
do
you
think
now
that
we
know
one
single
girl
who
in
her
heart
believes
it
is
better
never
to
love
and
never
to
marry
not
admitted
rhoda
more
cheerful
now
that
she
had
gained
her
point
we
know
several
who
will
not
dream
of
marrying
unless
reason
urges
them
as
strongly
as
inclination
miss
barfoot
laughed
who
ever
distinguished
in
such
a
case
between
reason
and
inclination
are
most
unusually
sceptical
said
rhoda
with
an
impatient
laugh
my
dear
we
happen
to
be
going
to
the
root
of
things
that
all
perhaps
it
as
well
to
do
so
now
and
then
oh
i
admire
you
immensely
rhoda
you
are
the
ideal
adversary
of
those
and
women
who
keep
the
world
back
but
do
prepare
for
yourself
a
woeful
disillusion
the
case
of
winifred
haven
urged
miss
nunn
is
a
and
charming
girl
and
some
one
or
other
will
want
to
marry
her
some
day
no
doubt
my
interrupting
you
there
is
great
doubt
she
has
no
money
but
what
she
can
earn
and
such
girls
unless
they
are
exceptionally
beautiful
are
very
likely
indeed
to
remain
unsought
but
let
us
suppose
she
has
an
offer
should
you
fear
for
her
prudence
has
much
good
sense
admitted
the
other
think
she
is
in
as
little
danger
as
any
girl
we
know
but
it
would
startle
me
if
she
made
the
most
lamentable
mistake
certainly
i
do
fear
it
the
girls
of
our
class
are
not
like
the
uneducated
who
for
one
reason
or
another
will
marry
almost
any
man
rather
than
remain
single
they
have
at
all
events
personal
delicacy
but
what
i
insist
upon
is
that
winifred
would
rather
marry
than
not
and
we
must
carefully
bear
that
fact
in
mind
a
strained
ideal
is
as
bad
practically
as
no
ideal
at
all
only
the
most
exceptional
girl
will
believe
it
her
duty
to
remain
single
as
an
example
and
support
to
what
we
call
the
odd
women
yet
is
the
most
human
way
of
urging
what
you
desire
by
taking
up
the
proud
position
that
a
woman
must
be
altogether
independent
of
sexual
things
you
damage
your
cause
let
us
be
glad
if
we
put
a
few
of
them
in
the
way
of
living
single
with
no
more
discontent
than
an
unmarried
man
experiences
that
an
unfortunate
comparison
said
rhoda
coldly
man
lives
in
celibacy
consider
that
unmentionable
fact
and
then
say
whether
i
am
wrong
in
refusing
to
forgive
miss
royston
women
battle
is
not
only
against
themselves
the
necessity
of
the
case
demands
what
you
call
a
strained
ideal
i
am
seriously
convinced
that
before
the
female
sex
can
be
raised
from
its
low
level
there
will
have
to
be
a
widespread
revolt
against
sexual
instinct
christianity
could
spread
over
the
world
without
help
of
the
ascetic
ideal
and
this
great
movement
for
woman
emancipation
must
also
have
its
ascetics
ca
declare
that
you
are
wrong
in
that
who
knows
but
it
good
policy
to
preach
it
to
our
young
disciples
shall
respect
your
wish
but
rhoda
paused
and
shook
her
head
dear
said
the
elder
woman
gravely
me
that
the
less
we
talk
or
think
about
such
things
the
better
for
the
peace
of
us
all
the
odious
fault
of
girls
in
town
and
country
alike
is
that
they
are
absorbed
in
preoccupation
with
their
animal
nature
we
thanks
to
our
education
and
the
tone
of
our
society
manage
to
keep
that
in
the
background
do
interfere
with
this
satisfactory
state
of
things
be
content
to
show
our
girls
that
it
is
their
duty
to
lead
a
life
of
effort
to
earn
their
bread
and
to
cultivate
their
minds
simply
ignore
marriage
that
the
wisest
behave
as
if
the
thing
did
exist
you
will
do
positive
harm
by
taking
the
other
course
the
aggressive
course
shall
obey
you
humble
creature
laughed
miss
barfoot
let
us
be
off
to
chelsea
did
miss
grey
finish
that
copy
for
mr
houghton
it
has
gone
to
post
here
a
big
manuscript
from
our
friend
the
antiquary
two
of
the
girls
must
get
to
work
on
it
at
once
in
the
morning
manuscripts
entrusted
to
them
were
kept
in
a
safe
when
this
had
been
locked
up
the
ladies
went
to
their
and
prepared
for
departure
the
people
who
lived
on

premises
were
responsible
for
cleaning
the
rooms
and
other

them

grave
and
silent
on
the
way

rhoda
annoyed
at
the
subject
that
doubtless
occupied

advance
a
week
notice
to
her
employers
would
release
monica
from
the
engagement
in
walworth
road
such
notice
must
be
given
on
monday
so
that
if
she
could
at
once
make
up
her
mind
to
accept
miss
offer
the
coming
week
would
be
her
last
of
slavery
behind
the
counter
on
the
way
home
from
queen
road
alice
and
virginia
pressed
for
immediate
decision
they
were
unable
to
comprehend
how
monica
could
hesitate
for
another
moment
the
question
of
her
place
of
abode
had
already
been
discussed
one
of
miss
barfoot
young
women
who
lived
at
a
convenient
distance
from
great
portland
street
would
gladly
accept
a
partner
in
her
lodging
an
arrangement
to
be
recommended
for
its
economy
yet
monica
shrank
from
speaking
the
final
word
do
know
whether
it
worth
while
she
said
after
a
long
silence
as
they
drew
near
to
york
road
station
whence
they
were
to
take
train
for
clapham
junction
worth
while
exclaimed
virginia
do
think
it
would
be
an
improvement
i
suppose
it
would
i
shall
see
how
i
feel
about
it
tomorrow
morning
she
spent
the
evening
at
lavender
hill
but
without
change
in
the
mood
thus
indicated
a
strange
inquietude
appeared
in
her
behaviour
it
was
as
though
she
were
being
urged
to
undertake
something
hard
and
repugnant
on
her
return
to
walworth
road
just
as
she
came
within
sight
of
the
shop
she
observed
a
man
figure
some
twenty
yards
distant
which
instantly
held
her
attention
the
dim
gaslight
occasioned
some
uncertainty
but
she
believed
the
figure
was
that
of
widdowson
he
was
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
away
from
her
when
the
man
was
exactly
opposite
scotcher
establishment
he
gazed
in
that
direction
but
without
stopping
monica
hastened
fearing
to
be
seen
and
approached
already
she
had
reached
the
door
when
widdowson
yes
he
it
was
turned
abruptly
to
walk
back
again
his
eye
was
at
once
upon
her
but
whether
he
recognized
her
or
not
monica
could
not
know
at
that
moment
she
opened
the
door
and
passed
in
a
fit
of
trembling
seized
her
as
if
she
had
barely
escaped
some
peril
in
the
passage
she
stood
motionless
listening
with
the
intensity
of
dread
she
could
hear
footsteps
on
the
pavement
she
expected
a
ring
at
the
if
he
were
so
thoughtless
as
to
come
to
the
door
she
would
on
no
account
see
him
but
there
was
no
ring
and
after
a
few
minutes
waiting
she
recovered
her
she
had
not
made
a
mistake
even
his
features
had
been
discernible
as
he
turned
towards
her
was
this
the
first
time
that
he
had
come
to
look
at
the
place
where
she
lived
possibly
to
spy
upon
her
she
resented
this
behaviour
yet
the
feeling
was
confused
with
a
certain
satisfaction
from
one
of
the
dormitories
there
was
a
view
of
walworth
road
she
ran
upstairs
softly
opened
the
door
of
that
room
and
peeped
in
the
low
burning
gas
showed
her
that
only
one
bed
had
an
occupant
who
appeared
to
be
asleep
softly
she
went
to
the
window
drew
the
blind
aside
and
looked
down
into
the
street
but
widdowson
had
disappeared
he
might
of
course
be
on
this
side
of
the
way
that
suddenly
asked
a
voice
from
the
occupied
bed
the
speaker
was
miss
eade
monica
looked
at
her
and
nodded
what
are
you
doing
here
wanted
to
see
if
some
one
was
standing
outside
mean
the
other
nodded
got
a
beastly
headache
i
could
hold
myself
up
and
i
had
to
come
home
at
eight
there
such
pains
all
down
my
back
too
i
sha
stay
at
this
beastly
place
much
longer
i
do
want
to
get
ill
like
miss
radford
somebody
went
to
see
her
at
the
hospital
this
afternoon
and
she
awfully
bad
well
have
you
seen
him
gone
and
monica
left
the
room
next
day
she
notified
her
intention
of
leaving
her
employment
no
questions
were
asked
she
was
of
no
particular
importance
fifty
or
for
the
matter
of
that
five
score
young
women
equally
capable
could
be
found
to
fill
her
place
on
tuesday
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
virginia
a
few
lines
requesting
her
to
meet
her
sisters
as
soon
as
possible
after
closing
time
that
evening
in
front
of
the
shop
have
something
to
tell
you
we
you
gave
notice
as
things
are
getting
so
bright
in
every
direction
at
a
quarter
to
ten
she
was
able
to
run
out
and
close
at
hand
were
the
two
eagerly
awaiting
her
darby
has
found
a
place
for
alice
began
virginia
heard
by
the
afternoon
post
yesterday
a
lady
at
yatton
wants
a
governess
for
two
young
children
is
it
fortunate
delightfully
convenient
for
what
we
were
thinking
of
put
in
the
eldest
with
her
croaking
voice
could
have
been
better
mean
about
the
school
said
monica
dreamily
the
school
virginia
replied
with
trembling
earnestness
is
convenient
both
for
clevedon
and
weston
alice
will
be
able
to
run
over
to
both
places
and
make
enquiries
and
ascertain
where
the
best
opening
would
be
miss
nunn
suggestion
hitherto
but
timidly
discussed
had
taken
hold
upon
their
minds
as
soon
as
alice
received
the
practical
call
to
her
native
region
both
were
enthusiastic
for
the
undertaking
it
afforded
them
a
novel
subject
of
conversation
and
inspirited
them
by
seeming
to
restore
their
after
all
they
might
have
a
mission
a
task
in
the
world
they
pictured
themselves
the
heads
of
a
respectable
and
thriving
establishment
with
subordinate
teachers
with
pleasant
social
relations
they
felt
young
again
and
capable
of
indefinite
activity
why
had
they
not
thought
of
this
long
ago
and
thereupon
they
reverted
to
antistrophic
laudation
of
rhoda
nunn
it
a
good
place
their
younger
sister
inquired
pretty
good
only
twelve
pounds
a
year
but
nice
people
darby
says
they
want
me
at
once
and
it
is
very
likely
that
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
go
with
them
to
the
seaside
have
been
better
cried
virginia
health
will
be
established
and
in
half
a
year
or
less
we
shall
be
able
to
come
to
a
decision
about
the
great
step
oh
and
have
you
given
notice
darling
i
have
both
clapped
their
hands
like
children
it
was
an
odd
little
scene
on
the
london
pavement
at
ten
at
night
so
intimately
domestic
amid
surroundings
the
very
antithesis
of
domesticity
only
a
few
yards
away
a
girl
to
whom
the
pavement
was
a
place
of
commerce
stood
laughing
with
two
men
the
sound
of
her
voice
hinted
to
monica
the
advisability
of
walking
as
they
conversed
and
they
moved
towards
walworth
road
station
thought
at
first
said
virginia
when
alice
had
gone
you
might
like
to
share
my
room
but
then
the
distance
from
great
portland
street
would
be
a
decided
objection
i
might
move
but
we
doubt
whether
that
would
be
worth
while
it
is
so
comfortable
with
conisbee
and
for
the
short
remaining
time
christmas
i
should
think
would
be
a
very
good
time
for
opening
if
it
were
possible
to
decide
upon
dear
old
clevedon
of
course
we
should
prefer
it
but
perhaps
weston
will
offer
more
scope
alice
will
weigh
all
the
arguments
on
the
spot
do
you
envy
her
monica
think
of
being
in
this
summer
weather
do
you
go
as
well
monica
asked
and
take
lodgings
you
mean
we
never
thought
of
that
but
we
still
have
to
consider
expenditure
very
seriously
you
know
if
possible
i
must
find
employment
for
the
rest
of
the
year
remember
how
very
likely
it
is
that
miss
nunn
will
have
something
to
suggest
for
me
and
when
i
think
it
will
be
of
so
much
practical
use
for
me
to
see
her
frequently
for
a
few
weeks
already
i
have
learnt
so
much
from
her
and
from
miss
barfoot
their
conversation
is
so
encouraging
i
feel
that
it
is
a
training
of
the
mind
to
be
in
contact
with
them
i
quite
share
that
view
said
alice
with
tremulous
earnestness
can
reap
much
profit
from
intercourse
with
them
they
have
the
new
ideas
in
education
and
it
would
be
so
good
if
our
school
began
with
the
advantage
of
quite
a
modern
system
monica
became
silent
when
her
sisters
had
talked
in
the
same
strain
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
said
absently
wrote
to
miss
barfoot
last
night
so
i
suppose
i
shall
be
able
to
move
to
those
lodgings
next
sunday
it
was
eleven
before
they
parted
having
taken
leave
of
her
sisters
near
the
station
monica
turned
to
walk
quickly
home
she
had
gone
about
half
the
way
when
her
name
was
spoken
just
behind
her
in
widdowson
voice
she
stopped
and
there
stood
the
man
offering
his
hand
are
you
here
at
this
time
she
asked
in
an
unsteady
voice
by
chance
i
had
a
hope
that
i
might
see
you
he
was
gloomy
and
looked
at
her
searchingly
must
wait
to
talk
now
widdowson
it
very
late
late
indeed
it
surprised
me
to
see
you
you
why
should
it
mean
that
it
seemed
so
very
unlikely
at
this
hour
how
could
you
have
hoped
to
see
me
monica
walked
on
with
an
air
of
displeasure
and
widdowson
kept
beside
her
incessantly
eyeing
her
countenance
i
did
really
think
of
seeing
you
miss
madden
i
wished
to
be
near
the
place
where
you
were
that
was
all
saw
me
come
out
i
dare
say
you
had
done
you
would
have
known
that
i
came
to
meet
two
ladies
my
sisters
i
walked
with
them
to
the
station
and
now
i
am
going
home
you
seem
to
think
an
explanation
necessary
forgive
me
what
right
have
i
to
ask
anything
of
the
kind
but
i
have
been
very
restless
since
sunday
i
wished
so
to
meet
you
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
only
an
hour
or
two
ago
i
posted
a
letter
to
you
monica
said
nothing
was
to
ask
you
to
meet
me
next
sunday
as
we
arranged
shall
you
be
able
to
do
so
afraid
i
ca
at
the
end
of
this
week
i
leave
my
place
here
and
on
sunday
i
shall
be
moving
to
another
part
of
london
are
leaving
you
have
decided
to
make
the
change
you
spoke
of
will
you
tell
me
where
you
are
going
to
live
lodgings
near
great
portland
street
i
must
say
widdowson
i
must
indeed
do
give
me
one
moment
ca
stay
i
ca
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
detain
her
ungracefully
he
caught
at
his
hat
made
the
salute
and
moved
away
with
rapid
uneven
strides
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
was
back
again
at
this
spot
he
walked
past
the
shop
many
times
without
pausing
his
eyes
devoured
the
front
of
the
building
and
noted
those
windows
in
which
there
was
a
glimmer
of
light
he
saw
girls
enter
by
the
private
door
but
monica
did
not
again
show
herself
some
time
after
midnight
when
the
house
had
long
been
dark
and
perfectly
quiet
the
uneasy
man
took
a
last
look
and
then
sought
a
cab
to
convey
him
home
the
letter
of
which
he
had
spoken
reached
monica
hands
next
morning
it
was
a
very
respectful
invitation
to
accompany
the
writer
on
a
drive
in
surrey
widdowson
proposed
to
meet
her
at
herne
hill
railway
station
where
his
vehicle
would
be
waiting
passing
i
shall
be
able
to
point
out
to
you
the
house
which
has
been
my
home
for
about
a
year
as
circumstances
were
it
would
be
hardly
possible
to
accept
this
invitation
without
exciting
curiosity
in
her
sisters
the
sunday
morning
would
be
occupied
probably
in
going
to
the
new
lodgings
and
making
the
acquaintance
of
her
future
companion
there
in
the
afternoon
her
sisters
were
to
pay
her
a
visit
as
alice
had
decided
to
start
for
somerset
on
the
monday
she
must
write
a
refusal
but
it
was
by
no
means
her
wish
to
discourage
widdowson
altogether
the
note
which
at
length
satisfied
her
ran
thus
widdowson
i
am
very
sorry
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
see
you
next
sunday
all
day
i
shall
be
occupied
my
eldest
sister
is
leaving
london
and
sunday
will
be
my
last
day
with
her
perhaps
for
a
long
time
please
do
not
think
that
i
make
light
of
your
kindness
when
i
am
settled
in
my
new
life
i
hope
to
be
able
to
let
you
know
how
it
suits
sincerely
yours
monica
madden
in
a
postscript
she
mentioned
her
new
address
it
was
written
in
very
small
characters
perhaps
an
unpurposed
indication
of
the
misgiving
with
which
she
allowed
herself
to
pen
the
words
two
days
went
by
and
again
a
letter
from
widdowson
was
delivered
miss
madden
my
chief
purpose
in
writing
again
so
soon
is
to
apologize
sincerely
for
my
behaviour
on
tuesday
evening
it
was
quite
unjustifiable
the
best
way
of
confessing
my
fault
is
to
own
that
i
had
a
foolish
dislike
of
your
walking
in
the
streets
unaccompanied
at
so
late
an
hour
i
believe
that
any
man
who
had
newly
made
your
acquaintance
and
had
thought
as
much
about
you
as
i
have
would
have
experienced
the
same
feeling
the
life
which
made
it
impossible
for
you
to
see
friends
at
any
other
time
of
the
day
was
so
evidently
unsuited
to
one
of
your
refinement
that
i
was
made
angry
by
the
thought
of
it
happily
it
is
coming
to
an
end
and
i
shall
be
greatly
relieved
when
i
know
that
you
have
left
the
house
of
business
remember
that
we
are
to
be
friends
i
should
be
much
less
than
your
friend
if
i
did
not
desire
for
you
a
position
very
different
from
that
which
necessity
forced
upon
you
thank
you
very
much
for
the
promise
to
tell
me
how
you
like
the
new
employment
and
your
new
friends
shall
you
not
henceforth
be
at
leisure
on
other
days
besides
sunday
as
you
will
now
be
near
regent
park
perhaps
i
may
hope
to
meet
you
there
some
evening
before
long
i
would
go
any
distance
to
see
you
and
speak
with
you
for
only
a
few
minutes
forgive
my
impertinence
and
believe
me
dear
miss
ever
yours
edmund
widdowson
now
this
undoubtedly
might
be
considered
a
and
it
was
the
first
of
its
kind
that
monica
had
ever
received
no
man
had
ever
written
to
her
that
he
was
willing
to
go
distance
for
the
reward
of
looking
on
her
face
she
read
the
composition
many
times
and
with
many
thoughts
it
did
not
enchant
her
presently
she
felt
it
to
be
dull
and
prosy
anything
but
the
ideal
of
a
even
at
this
early
stage
the
remarks
concerning
widdowson
made
in
the
bedroom
by
the
girl
who
fancied
her
asleep
had
greatly
disturbed
her
conception
of
him
he
was
old
and
looked
still
older
to
a
casual
eye
he
had
a
stiff
dry
way
and
already
had
begun
to
show
how
precise
and
exacting
he
could
be
a
year
or
two
ago
the
image
of
such
a
man
would
have
repelled
her
she
did
not
think
it
possible
to
regard
him
with
warm
feelings
yet
if
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
that
seemed
likely
to
happen
very
soon
almost
certainly
her
answer
would
be
yes
provided
of
course
that
all
he
had
told
her
about
himself
could
be
in
some
satisfactory
way
confirmed
her
acquaintance
with
him
was
an
extraordinary
thing
with
what
amazement
and
rapture
would
any
one
of
her
shop
companions
listen
to
the
advances
of
a
man
who
had
six
hundred
a
year
yet
monica
did
not
doubt
his
truthfulness
and
the
honesty
of
his
intentions
his
sounded
credible
enough
and
the
very
dryness
of
his
manner
inspired
confidence
as
things
went
in
the
marriage
war
she
might
esteem
herself
a
most
fortunate
young
woman
it
seemed
that
he
had
really
fallen
in
love
with
her
he
might
prove
a
devoted
husband
she
felt
no
love
in
return
but
between
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
of
esteem
and
that
of
no
marriage
at
all
there
was
little
room
for
hesitation
the
chances
were
that
she
might
never
again
receive
an
offer
from
a
man
whose
social
standing
she
could
respect
in
the
meantime
there
had
come
a
civil
little
note
from
the
girl
whose
rooms
she
was
to
share
barfoot
has
spoken
of
you
so
favourably
that
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
see
you
before
consenting
to
what
she
suggested
perhaps
she
has
told
you
that
i
have
my
own
furniture
it
is
very
plain
but
i
think
comfortable
for
the
two
rooms
with
attendance
i
pay
eight
and
sixpence
a
week
my
landlady
will
ask
eleven
shillings
when
there
are
two
of
us
so
that
your
share
would
be
i
hope
you
wo
think
this
is
too
much
i
am
a
quiet
and
i
think
a
very
reasonable
person
the
signature
was
h
vesper
the
day
of
release
arrived
as
it
poured
with
rain
all
the
morning
monica
the
less
regretted
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
postpone
her
meeting
with
widdowson
at
she
said
to
the
three
or
four
girls
in
whom
she
had
any
interest
miss
eade
was
delighted
to
see
her
go
this
rival
finally
out
of
the
way
bullivant
might
perchance
turn
his
attention
to
the
faithful
admirer
who
remained
she
went
by
train
to
great
portland
street
and
thence
by
cab
with
her
two
boxes
to
rutland
street
hampstead
road
an
uphill
little
street
of
small
houses
when
the
cab
stopped
the
door
of
the
house
she
sought
at
once
opened
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
a
short
prim
girl
who
smiled
a
welcome
are
miss
vesper
monica
said
approaching
her
very
pleased
to
see
you
miss
madden
as
london
cabmen
have
a
narrow
view
of
their
duties
i
help
you
to
get
the
boxes
in
monica
liked
the
girl
at
once
jehu
condescending
to
hand
down
the
luggage
they
transferred
it
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
then
the
fare
having
been
paid
went
up
to
the
second
floor
which
was
the
top
of
the
house
miss
vesper
two
rooms
were
very
humble
but
homely
she
looked
at
monica
to
remark
the
impression
produced
by
them
it
do
very
nicely
indeed
after
my
quarters
in
walworth
road
but
i
feel
ashamed
to
intrude
upon
you
have
been
trying
to
find
someone
to
share
my
rent
said
the
other
with
a
simple
frankness
that
was
very
agreeable
barfoot
was
full
of
your
praises
and
indeed
i
think
we
may
suit
each
other
shall
try
to
be
as
little
disturbance
to
you
as
possible
i
to
you
the
street
is
a
very
quiet
one
up
above
here
is
cumberland
market
a
hay
and
straw
market
quite
pleasant
odours
country
odours
reach
us
on
market
day
i
am
that
why
i
speak
of
such
a
trifle
am
i
said
monica
come
from
somerset
i
from
hampshire
do
you
know
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
all
the
really
nice
girls
in
london
country
girls
monica
had
to
look
at
the
speaker
to
be
sure
that
this
was
said
in
pleasantry
miss
vesper
was
fond
of
making
dry
little
jokes
in
the
gravest
tone
only
a
twinkle
of
her
eyes
and
a
movement
of
her
tight
little
lips
betrayed
her
i
ask
the
landlady
to
help
me
up
with
the
luggage
are
rather
pale
miss
madden
better
let
me
see
to
that
i
have
to
go
down
to
remind
hocking
to
put
salt
into
the
saucepan
with
the
potatoes
she
cooks
for
me
only
on
sunday
and
if
i
did
remind
her
every
week
she
would
boil
the
potatoes
without
salt
such
a
state
of
mind
is
curious
but
one
ends
by
accepting
it
as
a
fact
in
nature
they
joined
in
merry
laughter
when
miss
vesper
gave
way
to
open
mirth
she
enjoyed
it
so
thoroughly
that
it
was
a
delight
to
look
at
her
by
the
time
dinner
was
over
they
were
on
excellent
terms
and
had
exchanged
a
great
deal
of
personal
information
mildred
vesper
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
most
contented
of
young
women
she
had
sisters
and
brothers
whom
she
loved
all
scattered
about
england
in
pursuit
of
a
livelihood
it
was
rare
for
any
two
of
them
to
see
each
other
but
she
spoke
of
this
as
quite
in
the
order
of
things
for
miss
barfoot
her
respect
was
unbounded
had
made
more
of
me
than
any
one
else
could
have
done
when
i
first
met
her
three
years
ago
i
was
a
simpleton
i
thought
myself
because
i
had
to
work
hard
for
next
to
no
payment
and
live
in
solitude
now
i
should
be
ashamed
to
complain
of
what
falls
to
the
lot
of
thousands
of
girls
you
like
miss
nunn
asked
monica
so
well
as
miss
barfoot
but
i
think
very
highly
of
her
her
zeal
makes
her
exaggerate
a
little
now
and
then
but
then
the
zeal
is
so
splendid
i
have
it
myself
not
in
that
form
mean
mean
that
i
feel
a
shameful
delight
when
i
hear
of
a
girl
getting
married
it
very
weak
no
doubt
perhaps
i
shall
improve
as
i
grow
older
but
i
have
half
a
suspicion
do
you
know
that
miss
barfoot
is
not
without
the
same
weakness
monica
laughed
and
spoke
of
something
else
she
was
in
good
spirits
already
her
companion
view
of
life
began
to
have
an
effect
upon
her
she
thought
of
people
and
things
in
a
more
lightsome
way
and
was
less
disposed
to
commiserate
herself
the
bedroom
which
both
were
to
occupy
might
with
advantage
have
been
larger
but
they
knew
that
many
girls
of
instinct
no
less
delicate
than
their
own
had
to
endure
far
worse
accommodation
in
london
where
poverty
pays
for
its
sheltered
at
so
much
a
square
foot
it
was
only
of
late
that
miss
vesper
had
been
able
to
buy
furniture
four
sovereigns
it
cost
in
all
and
thus
to
allow
herself
the
luxury
of
two
rooms
at
the
rent
she
previously
paid
for
one
miss
barfoot
did
not
remunerate
her
workers
on
a
philanthropic
scale
but
strictly
in
accordance
with
market
prices
common
sense
dictated
this
principle
in
talking
over
their
arrangements
monica
decided
to
expend
a
few
shillings
on
the
purchase
of
a
for
her
own
use
often
have
nightmares
she
remarked
kick
a
great
deal
it
would
be
nice
to
give
you
bruises
a
week
passed
alice
had
written
from
yatton
and
in
a
cheerful
tone
virginia
chronically
excited
had
made
calls
at
rutland
street
and
at
queen
road
she
talked
like
one
who
had
suddenly
received
a
great
illumination
and
her
zeal
in
the
cause
of
independent
womanhood
rivalled
miss
nunn
without
enthusiasm
but
seemingly
contented
monica
worked
at
the
typewriting
machine
and
had
begun
certain
studies
which
her
friends
judged
to
be
useful
she
experienced
a
growth
of
it
was
much
to
have
risen
above
the
status
of
and
the
change
of
moral
atmosphere
had
a
very
beneficial
effect
upon
her
mildred
vesper
was
a
studious
little
person
after
a
fashion
of
her
own
she
possessed
four
volumes
of
maunder
and
to
one
or
other
of
these
she
applied
herself
for
at
least
an
hour
every
evening
nature
she
said
when
monica
sought
an
explanation
of
this
study
mind
is
frivolous
what
i
need
is
a
store
of
solid
information
to
reflect
upon
no
one
could
possibly
have
a
worse
memory
but
by
persevering
i
manage
to
learn
one
or
two
facts
a
day
monica
glanced
at
the
books
now
and
then
but
had
no
desire
to
cultivate
maunder
acquaintance
instead
of
reading
she
meditated
the
problems
of
her
own
life
edmund
widdowson
of
course
wrote
to
her
at
the
new
address
in
her
reply
she
again
postponed
their
meeting
whenever
she
went
out
in
the
evening
it
was
with
expectation
of
seeing
him
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
she
felt
assured
that
he
had
long
ago
come
to
look
at
the
house
and
more
likely
than
not
his
eyes
had
several
times
been
upon
her
that
did
not
matter
her
life
was
innocent
and
widdowson
might
watch
her
coming
and
going
as
much
as
he
would
at
length
about
nine
one
evening
she
came
face
to
face
with
him
it
was
in
hampstead
road
she
had
been
buying
at
a
draper
and
carried
the
little
parcel
at
the
moment
of
recognition
face
so
flushed
and
brightened
that
monica
could
not
help
a
sympathetic
feeling
of
pleasure
are
you
so
cruel
to
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
she
gave
her
hand
a
time
since
i
saw
you
that
really
true
she
replied
with
an
air
more
resembling
coquetry
than
any
he
had
yet
seen
in
her
i
spoke
to
you
then
did
you
see
me
evenings
ago
you
were
walking
in
tottenham
court
road
with
a
young
lady
vesper
the
friend
i
live
with
you
give
me
a
few
minutes
now
he
asked
humbly
it
too
late
for
reply
monica
moved
slowly
on
they
turned
up
one
of
the
ways
parallel
with
rutland
street
and
so
came
into
the
quiet
district
that
skirts
regent
park
widdowson
talking
all
the
way
in
a
strain
of
all
but
avowed
tenderness
his
head
bent
towards
her
and
his
voice
so
much
subdued
that
occasionally
she
lost
a
few
words
ca
live
without
seeing
you
he
said
at
length
you
refuse
to
meet
me
i
have
no
choice
but
to
come
wandering
about
the
places
where
you
are
do
pray
do
think
i
spy
upon
you
indeed
it
is
only
just
to
see
your
face
or
your
form
as
you
walk
along
when
i
have
had
my
journey
in
vain
i
go
back
in
misery
you
are
never
out
of
my
thoughts
never
am
sorry
for
that
mr
widdowson
are
you
really
sorry
do
you
think
of
me
with
less
friendliness
than
when
we
had
our
evening
on
the
river
not
with
less
friendliness
but
if
i
only
make
you
unhappy
one
way
unhappy
but
as
no
one
else
ever
had
the
power
to
if
you
would
let
me
meet
you
at
certain
times
my
restlessness
would
be
at
an
end
the
summer
is
going
so
quickly
wo
you
come
for
that
drive
with
me
next
sunday
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
at
any
place
you
like
to
appoint
if
you
could
imagine
what
joy
it
would
give
me
presently
monica
assented
if
it
were
fine
she
would
be
by
the
southeast
entrance
to
regent
park
at
two
he
thanked
her
with
words
of
the
most
submissive
gratitude
and
then
they
parted
the
day
proved
doubtful
but
she
kept
her
appointment
widdowson
was
on
the
spot
with
horse
and
trap
these
were
not
as
he
presently
informed
monica
his
own
property
but
hired
from
a
livery
stable
according
to
his
custom
wo
rain
he
exclaimed
gazing
at
the
sky
rain
these
few
hours
are
too
precious
to
me
would
be
very
awkward
if
it
monica
replied
in
merry
humour
as
they
drove
along
the
sky
threatened
till
sundown
but
widdowson
was
able
to
keep
declaring
that
rain
would
not
come
he
took
a
course
crossed
waterloo
bridge
and
thence
by
the
highways
made
for
herne
hill
monica
observed
that
he
made
a
short
detour
to
avoid
walworth
road
she
asked
his
reason
hate
the
road
widdowson
answered
with
vehemence
hate
it
you
slaved
and
suffered
there
if
i
had
the
power
i
would
destroy
it
every
house
many
a
time
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
you
were
lying
asleep
i
walked
up
and
down
there
in
horrible
misery
because
i
had
to
stand
at
a
counter
only
that
it
was
fit
for
you
to
work
in
that
way
but
the
people
about
you
i
hated
every
face
of
man
or
woman
that
passed
along
the
street
did
like
the
society
should
hope
not
of
course
i
know
you
did
why
did
you
ever
come
to
such
a
place
there
was
severity
rather
than
sympathy
in
his
look
was
tired
of
the
dull
country
life
monica
replied
frankly
then
i
did
know
what
the
shops
and
the
people
were
like
you
need
a
life
of
excitement
he
asked
with
a
sidelong
glance
no
but
one
must
have
change
when
they
reached
herne
hill
widdowson
became
silent
and
presently
he
allowed
the
horse
to
walk
is
my
house
miss
madden
the
one
monica
looked
and
saw
two
little
villas
built
together
with
stone
facings
porches
at
the
doors
and
ornamented
gables
only
wanted
to
show
it
you
he
added
quickly
nothing
pretty
or
noticeable
about
it
and
it
is
at
all
grandly
furnished
my
old
housekeeper
and
one
servant
manage
to
keep
it
in
order
they
passed
and
monica
did
not
allow
herself
to
look
back
think
it
a
nice
house
she
said
presently
my
life
i
have
wished
to
have
a
house
of
my
own
but
i
did
dare
to
hope
i
ever
should
men
in
general
do
seem
to
care
so
long
as
they
have
lodgings
that
suit
them
i
mean
unmarried
men
but
i
always
wanted
to
live
alone
without
strangers
that
is
to
say
i
told
you
that
i
am
not
very
sociable
when
i
got
my
house
i
was
like
a
child
with
a
toy
i
could
sleep
for
satisfaction
i
used
to
walk
all
over
it
day
after
day
before
it
was
furnished
there
was
something
that
delighted
me
in
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
on
the
staircases
and
the
bare
floors
here
i
shall
live
and
die
i
kept
saying
to
myself
not
in
solitude
i
hoped
perhaps
i
might
meet
some
one
monica
interrupted
him
to
ask
a
question
about
some
object
in
the
landscape
he
answered
her
very
briefly
and
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
then
the
girl
glancing
at
him
with
a
smile
of
apology
said
in
a
gentle
tone
were
telling
me
how
the
house
pleased
you
have
you
still
the
same
pleasure
in
living
there
but
lately
i
have
been
hoping
i
dare
say
more
you
will
interrupt
me
again
way
are
we
going
now
mr
widdowson
streatham
then
on
to
carshalton
at
five
we
will
use
our
right
as
travellers
and
get
some
innkeeper
to
make
tea
for
us
look
the
sun
is
trying
to
break
through
we
shall
have
a
fine
evening
yet
may
i
without
rudeness
say
that
you
look
better
since
you
left
that
abominable
place
i
feel
better
after
keeping
his
look
fixed
for
a
long
time
on
the
horse
ears
widdowson
turned
gravely
to
his
companion
told
you
about
my
would
you
be
willing
to
make
her
acquaintance
do
feel
able
to
do
that
widdowson
monica
answered
with
decision
prepared
for
this
reply
he
began
a
long
and
urgent
persuasion
it
was
useless
monica
listened
quietly
but
without
sign
of
yielding
the
subject
dropped
and
they
talked
of
indifferent
things
on
the
homeward
drive
when
the
dull
sky
grew
dusk
about
them
and
the
suburban
began
to
show
themselves
in
long
glimmering
lines
widdowson
returned
with
shamefaced
courage
to
the
subject
which
for
some
hours
had
been
in
abeyance
ca
part
from
you
this
evening
without
a
word
of
hope
to
remember
you
know
that
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
will
you
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
i
can
say
or
do
to
make
your
consent
possible
have
you
any
doubt
of
me
doubt
whatever
of
your
sincerity
one
sense
i
am
still
a
stranger
to
you
will
you
give
me
the
opportunity
of
making
things
between
us
more
regular
will
you
allow
me
to
meet
some
friend
of
yours
whom
you
trust
had
rather
you
did
yet
wish
to
know
still
more
of
me
personally
i
think
i
must
know
you
much
better
before
i
can
consent
to
any
step
of
that
kind
he
urged
we
became
acquaintances
in
the
ordinary
way
and
knew
each
other
friends
would
that
be
most
satisfactory
to
you
might
be
but
you
forget
that
so
much
would
have
to
be
explained
i
have
behaved
very
strangely
if
i
told
everything
to
my
friends
i
should
leave
myself
no
choice
why
not
you
would
be
absolutely
free
i
could
no
more
than
try
to
recommend
myself
to
you
if
i
am
so
unhappy
as
to
fail
how
would
you
be
anything
but
quite
free
surely
you
must
understand
me
in
this
position
i
must
either
not
speak
of
you
at
all
or
make
it
known
that
i
am
engaged
to
you
i
have
it
taken
for
granted
that
i
am
engaged
to
you
when
i
do
wish
to
be
widdowson
head
drooped
he
set
his
lips
in
a
hard
gloomy
expression
have
behaved
very
imprudently
continued
the
girl
but
i
see
i
ca
see
what
else
i
could
have
done
things
are
so
badly
arranged
it
was
possible
for
us
to
be
introduced
by
any
one
who
knew
us
both
so
i
had
either
to
break
off
your
acquaintance
after
that
first
conversation
or
conduct
myself
as
i
have
been
doing
i
think
it
a
very
hard
position
my
sisters
would
call
me
an
immodest
girl
but
i
do
think
it
is
true
i
may
perhaps
come
to
feel
you
as
a
girl
ought
to
when
she
marries
and
how
else
can
i
tell
unless
i
meet
you
and
talk
with
you
and
your
position
is
just
the
same
i
do
blame
you
for
a
moment
i
think
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
blame
you
yet
we
have
gone
against
the
ordinary
rule
and
people
would
make
us
suffer
for
it
or
me
at
all
events
her
voice
at
the
close
was
uncertain
widdowson
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
passionate
admiration
you
for
saying
that
for
putting
it
so
well
and
so
kindly
for
me
let
us
disregard
people
then
let
us
go
on
seeing
each
other
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
he
choked
a
little
at
this
first
utterance
of
the
solemn
word
your
rules
shall
be
mine
give
me
a
chance
of
winning
you
tell
me
if
i
offend
you
in
anything
if
there
anything
you
dislike
in
me
you
cease
coming
to
look
for
me
when
i
do
know
of
it
promise
you
i
will
never
come
again
and
you
will
meet
me
a
little
oftener
will
see
you
once
every
week
but
i
must
still
be
perfectly
free
i
will
only
try
to
win
you

man

loves

chapter
viii
cousin
everard
as
miss
barfoot
eye
fell
on
the
letters
brought
to
her
at
she
uttered
an
exclamation
doubtful
in
its
significance
rhoda
nunn
who
rarely
had
a
letter
from
any
one
looked
up
inquiringly
am
greatly
mistaken
if
that
is
my
cousin
everard
writing
i
thought
so
he
is
in
london
rhoda
made
no
remark
read
it
said
the
other
handing
her
friend
the
epistle
after
she
had
gone
through
it
the
handwriting
was
remarkably
bold
but
careful
punctuation
was
strictly
attended
to
and
in
places
a
word
had
been
obliterated
with
a
circular
scrawl
which
left
it
still
legible
cousin
mary
i
hear
that
you
are
still
active
in
an
original
way
and
that
civilization
is
more
and
more
indebted
to
you
since
my
arrival
in
london
a
few
weeks
ago
i
have
several
times
been
on
the
point
of
calling
at
your
house
but
scruples
withheld
me
our
last
interview
was
not
quite
friendly
on
your
side
you
will
remember
and
perhaps
your
failure
to
write
to
me
means
continued
displeasure
in
that
case
i
might
be
rejected
at
your
door
which
i
should
like
for
i
am
troubled
with
a
foolish
sense
of
personal
dignity
i
have
taken
a
flat
and
mean
to
stay
in
london
for
at
least
half
a
year
please
let
me
know
whether
i
may
see
you
indeed
i
should
like
to
nature
meant
us
for
good
friends
but
prejudice
came
between
us
just
a
line
either
of
welcome
or
get
thee
behind
me
in
spite
of
your
censures
i
always
was
and
still
am
affectionately
yours
everard
barfoot
rhoda
perused
the
sheet
very
attentively
impudent
letter
said
miss
barfoot
like
him
does
he
appear
from
i
suppose
but
prejudice
came
between
us
i
like
that
moral
conviction
is
always
prejudice
in
the
eyes
of
these
advanced
young
men
of
course
he
must
come
i
am
anxious
to
see
what
time
has
made
of
him
it
really
moral
censure
that
kept
you
from
writing
to
him
inquired
rhoda
with
a
smile
i
did
approve
of
him
at
all
as
i
have
frequently
told
you
i
gather
that
he
has
changed
much
in
theories
replied
miss
barfoot
is
to
be
expected
he
is
far
too
stubborn
but
in
mode
of
life
he
may
possibly
be
more
tolerable
two
or
three
years
in
japan
rejoined
rhoda
with
a
slight
raising
of
the
eyebrows
is
about
and
before
he
left
england
i
think
he
showed
possibilities
of
future
wisdom
of
course
i
disapprove
of
him
and
if
necessary
shall
let
him
understand
that
quite
as
plainly
as
before
but
there
no
harm
in
seeing
if
he
has
learnt
to
behave
himself
everard
barfoot
received
an
invitation
to
dine
it
was
promptly
accepted
and
on
the
evening
of
the
appointment
he
arrived
at
seven
his
cousin
sat
alone
in
the
at
his
entrance
she
regarded
him
with
keen
but
friendly
scrutiny
he
had
a
tall
muscular
frame
and
a
head
of
striking
outline
with
large
nose
full
lips
eyes
and
prominent
eyebrows
his
hair
was
the
richest
tone
of
chestnut
his
moustache
and
beard
the
latter
peaking
slightly
forward
inclined
to
redness
excellent
health
manifested
itself
in
the
warm
purity
of
his
skin
in
his
cheerful
aspect
and
the
lightness
of
his
bearing
the
lower
half
of
his
forehead
was
wrinkled
and
when
he
did
not
fix
his
look
on
anything
in
particular
his
eyelids
drooped
giving
him
for
the
moment
an
air
of
languor
on
sitting
down
he
at
once
abandoned
himself
to
a
posture
of
the
completest
ease
which
his
admirable
proportions
made
graceful
from
his
appearance
one
would
have
expected
him
to
speak
in
rather
loud
and
decided
tones
but
he
had
a
soft
voice
and
used
it
with
all
the
discretion
of
so
that
at
times
it
seemed
to
caress
the
ear
to
this
mode
of
utterance
corresponded
his
smile
which
was
frequent
but
restrained
to
the
expression
of
a
delicate
irony
one
had
told
me
of
your
return
were
miss
barfoot
first
words
as
she
shook
hands
with
him
fancy
because
no
one
knew
you
were
the
first
of
my
kinsfolk
to
whom
i
wrote
honour
everard
you
look
very
well
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
the
same
of
you
and
yet
i
hear
that
you
work
harder
than
ever
is
the
source
of
your
information
about
me
had
an
account
of
you
from
tom
in
a
letter
that
caught
me
at
constantinople
i
thought
he
had
forgotten
my
existence
who
told
him
about
me
i
ca
imagine
so
you
did
come
straight
home
from
japan
barfoot
was
nursing
his
knee
his
head
thrown
back
i
loitered
a
little
in
egypt
and
turkey
are
you
living
quite
alone
he
drawled
slightly
on
the
last
word
its
second
vowel
making
quite
a
musical
note
of
wonderful
expressiveness
the
clear
decision
of
his
cousin
reply
was
a
sharp
contrast
lady
lives
with
me
miss
nunn
she
will
join
us
in
a
moment
nunn
he
smiled
partner
in
your
activity
gives
me
valuable
help
must
hear
all
about
it
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
some
day
it
will
interest
me
greatly
you
always
were
the
most
interesting
of
our
family
brother
tom
promised
to
be
a
genius
but
marriage
has
blighted
the
hope
i
fear
marriage
was
a
very
absurd
one
it
i
feared
so
but
tom
seems
satisfied
i
suppose
they
will
stay
at
madeira
his
wife
is
tired
of
her
imaginary
phthisis
and
amuses
herself
with
imagining
some
other
ailment
that
requires
them
to
go
to
siberia
that
kind
of
person
is
she
he
smiled
indulgently
and
played
for
a
moment
with
the
lobe
of
his
right
ear
his
ears
were
small
and
of
the
ideal
contour
the
hand
too
thus
displayed
was
a
fine
example
of
blended
strength
and
elegance
rhoda
came
in
so
quietly
that
she
was
able
to
observe
the
guest
before
he
had
detected
her
presence
the
movement
of
miss
barfoot
eyes
first
informed
him
that
another
person
was
in
the
room
in
the
quietest
possible
way
the
introduction
was
performed
and
all
seated
themselves
dressed
like
the
hostess
in
black
and
without
ornaments
of
any
kind
save
a
silver
buckle
at
her
waist
rhoda
seemed
to
have
endeavoured
to
liken
herself
to
the
suggestion
of
her
name
by
the
excessive
plainness
with
which
she
had
arranged
her
hair
its
tight
smoothness
was
nothing
like
so
becoming
as
the
mode
she
usually
adopted
and
it
made
her
look
older
whether
by
accident
or
design
she
took
an
upright
chair
and
sat
upon
it
in
a
stiff
attitude
finding
it
difficult
to
suspect
rhoda
of
shyness
miss
barfoot
once
or
twice
glanced
at
her
with
curiosity
for
settled
conversation
there
was
no
time
a
servant
announced
dinner
almost
immediately
shall
be
no
forms
cousin
everard
said
the
hostess
to
follow
us
doing
so
everard
examined
miss
nunn
figure
which
in
its
way
was
strong
and
shapely
as
his
own
a
motion
of
his
lips
indicated
amused
approval
but
at
once
he
commanded
himself
and
entered
the
with
exemplary
gravity
naturally
he
sat
opposite
rhoda
and
his
eyes
often
skimmed
her
face
when
she
spoke
which
was
very
seldom
he
gazed
at
her
with
close
attention
during
the
first
part
of
the
meal
miss
barfoot
questioned
her
relative
concerning
his
oriental
experiences
everard
spoke
of
them
in
a
light
agreeable
way
avoiding
the
tone
of
instruction
and
in
short
giving
evidence
of
good
taste
rhoda
listened
with
a
look
of
civil
interest
but
asked
no
question
and
smiled
only
when
it
was
unavoidable
presently
the
talk
turned
to
things
of
home
you
heard
of
your
friend
mr
poppleton
the
hostess
asked
nothing
whatever
i
should
like
to
see
him
sorry
to
tell
you
he
is
in
a
lunatic
asylum
as
barfoot
kept
the
silence
of
astonishment
his
cousin
went
on
to
tell
him
that
the
unhappy
man
seemed
to
have
lost
his
wits
among
business
troubles
i
should
have
suggested
another
explanation
remarked
the
young
man
in
his
most
discreet
tone
never
met
mrs
poppleton
seeing
that
miss
nunn
had
looked
up
with
interest
he
addressed
himself
to
her
friend
poppleton
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
men
perhaps
the
best
and
kindest
i
ever
knew
and
so
overflowing
with
natural
wit
and
humour
that
there
was
no
resisting
his
cheerful
influence
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
who
knew
him
he
married
perhaps
the
dullest
woman
he
could
have
found
poppleton
not
only
never
made
a
joke
but
could
understand
what
joking
meant
only
the
flattest
literalism
was
intelligible
to
her
she
could
follow
nothing
but
the
very
macadam
of
conversation
had
no
palate
for
anything
but
the
of
talk
rhoda
eyes
twinkled
and
miss
barfoot
laughed
everard
was
allowing
himself
a
freedom
in
expression
which
hitherto
he
had
sedulously
avoided
he
continued
was
by
birth
a
lady
which
made
the
infliction
harder
to
bear
poor
old
poppleton
again
and
again
i
have
heard
him
what
do
you
think
laboriously
jests
to
her
that
was
a
trial
as
you
may
imagine
there
we
sat
we
three
in
the
unbeautiful
little
parlour
for
they
were
anything
but
rich
poppleton
would
say
something
that
convulsed
me
with
laughter
in
spite
of
my
efforts
for
i
always
dreaded
the
result
so
much
that
i
strove
my
hardest
to
do
no
more
than
smile
appreciation
my
laugh
compelled
poppleton
to
stare
at
me
oh
her
eyes
thereupon
her
husband
began
his
dread
performance
the
patience
the
heroic
patience
of
that
dear
good
fellow
i
have
known
him
explain
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
invariably
without
success
it
might
be
a
mere
pun
poppleton
no
more
understood
the
nature
of
a
pun
than
of
the
binomial
theorem
but
worse
was
when
the
jest
involved
some
allusion
when
i
heard
poppleton
begin
to
elucidate
to
expound
the
perspiration
already
on
his
forehead
i
looked
at
him
with
imploring
anguish
why
he
attempt
the
impossible
but
the
kind
fellow
disregard
his
wife
request
shall
i
ever
forget
her
oh
yes
i
see
when
obviously
she
saw
nothing
but
the
wall
at
which
she
sat
staring
have
known
her
like
said
miss
barfoot
merrily
am
convinced
his
madness
did
come
from
business
anxiety
it
was
the
necessity
ever
recurring
ever
before
him
of
expounding
jokes
to
his
wife
believe
me
it
was
nothing
but
that
seems
very
probable
asserted
rhoda
dryly
there
another
friend
of
yours
whose
marriage
has
been
unfortunate
said
the
hostess
tell
me
that
orchard
has
forsaken
his
wife
and
without
intelligible
reason
too
i
can
offer
an
explanation
replied
barfoot
quietly
you
may
doubt
whether
it
justifies
him
i
met
orchard
a
few
months
ago
in
alexandria
met
him
by
chance
in
the
street
and
recognize
him
until
he
spoke
to
me
he
was
worn
to
skin
and
bone
i
found
that
he
had
abandoned
all
his
possessions
to
orchard
and
just
kept
himself
alive
on
casual
work
for
the
magazines
wandering
about
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
like
an
uneasy
spirit
he
showed
me
the
thing
he
had
last
written
and
i
see
it
is
published
in
this
month
do
read
it
an
exquisite
description
of
a
night
in
alexandria
one
of
these
days
he
will
starve
to
death
a
pity
he
might
have
done
fine
work
we
await
your
explanation
what
business
has
he
to
desert
his
wife
and
children
me
give
an
account
of
a
day
i
spent
with
him
at
tintern
not
long
before
i
left
england
he
and
his
wife
were
having
a
holiday
there
and
i
called
on
them
we
went
to
walk
about
the
abbey
now
for
some
two
hours
i
will
be
strictly
truthful
whilst
we
were
in
the
midst
of
that
lovely
scenery
orchard
discoursed
unceasingly
of
one
subject
the
difficulty
she
had
with
her
domestic
servants
ten
or
twelve
of
these
handmaidens
were
marshalled
before
our
imagination
their
names
their
ages
their
antecedents
the
wages
they
received
were
carefully
specified
we
listened
to
a
of
the
plates
cups
and
other
utensils
that
they
had
broken
we
heard
of
the
enormities
which
in
each
case
led
to
their
dismissal
orchard
tried
repeatedly
to
change
the
subject
but
only
with
the
effect
of
irritating
his
wife
what
could
he
or
i
do
but
patiently
give
ear
our
walk
was
ruined
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
be
good
enough
to
extend
this
kind
of
thing
over
a
number
of
years
picture
orchard
sitting
down
in
his
home
to
literary
work
and
liable
at
any
moment
to
an
invasion
from
orchard
who
comes
to
tell
him
at
great
length
that
the
butcher
has
charged
for
a
joint
they
have
not
consumed
or
something
of
that
kind
he
assured
me
that
his
choice
lay
between
flight
and
suicide
and
i
firmly
believed
him
as
he
concluded
his
eyes
met
those
of
miss
nunn
and
the
latter
suddenly
spoke
will
men
marry
fools
barfoot
was
startled
he
looked
down
into
his
plate
smiling
most
sensible
question
said
the
hostess
with
a
laugh
indeed
a
difficult
one
to
answer
remarked
everard
with
his
most
restrained
smile
miss
nunn
narrow
social
opportunity
has
something
to
do
with
it
they
must
marry
some
one
and
in
the
case
of
most
men
choice
is
seriously
restricted
should
have
thought
replied
rhoda
elevating
her
eyebrows
to
live
alone
was
the
less
of
two
evils
but
men
like
these
two
we
have
been
speaking
of
have
a
very
logical
mind
miss
barfoot
changed
the
topic
when
not
long
after
the
ladies
left
him
to
meditate
over
his
glass
of
wine
everard
curiously
surveyed
the
room
then
his
eyelids
drooped
he
smiled
absently
and
a
calm
sigh
seemed
to
relieve
his
chest
the
claret
had
no
particular
quality
to
recommend
it
and
in
any
case
he
would
have
drunk
very
little
for
as
regards
the
bottle
his
nature
was
abstemious
is
as
i
expected
miss
barfoot
was
saying
to
her
friend
in
the
has
changed
very
noticeably
barfoot
is
quite
the
man
your
remarks
had
suggested
to
me
rhoda
replied
fancy
he
is
no
longer
the
man
i
knew
his
manners
are
wonderfully
improved
he
used
to
assert
himself
in
rather
alarming
ways
his
letter
to
be
sure
had
the
old
tone
or
something
of
it
will
go
to
the
library
for
an
hour
said
rhoda
who
had
not
seated
herself
barfoot
wo
leave
before
ten
i
suppose
do
think
there
will
be
any
private
talk
if
you
will
let
me
so
when
everard
appeared
he
found
his
cousin
alone
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
of
him
do
you
mean
how
do
i
propose
to
employ
myself
i
have
nothing
whatever
in
view
beyond
enjoying
life
your
age
young
or
so
old
which
young
of
course
you
deliberately
intend
to
waste
your
life
enjoy
it
i
said
i
am
not
prompted
to
any
business
or
profession
that
all
over
for
me
i
have
learnt
all
i
care
to
of
the
active
world
what
do
you
understand
by
enjoyment
asked
miss
barfoot
with
knitted
brows
the
spectacle
of
existence
quite
enough
to
occupy
one
through
a
lifetime
if
a
man
merely
travelled
could
he
possibly
exhaust
all
the
beauties
and
magnificences
that
are
offered
to
him
in
every
country
for
ten
years
and
more
i
worked
as
hard
as
any
man
i
shall
never
regret
it
for
it
has
given
me
a
feeling
of
liberty
and
opportunity
such
as
i
should
not
have
known
if
i
had
always
lived
at
my
ease
it
taught
me
a
great
deal
too
supplemented
my
education
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
but
to
work
for
ever
is
to
lose
half
of
life
i
ca
understand
those
people
who
reconcile
themselves
to
quitting
the
world
without
having
seen
a
millionth
part
of
it
am
quite
reconciled
to
that
an
infinite
picture
gallery
is
my
idea
of
enjoyment
mine
but
an
infinite
series
of
modes
of
living
a
ceaseless
exercise
of
all
one
faculties
of
pleasure
that
sounds
shameless
to
you
i
ca
understand
why
it
should
why
is
the
man
who
toils
more
meritorious
than
he
who
enjoys
what
is
the
sanction
for
this
judgment
usefulness
everard
admit
the
demand
for
social
usefulness
up
to
a
certain
point
but
really
i
have
done
my
share
the
mass
of
men
do
toil
with
any
such
ideal
but
merely
to
keep
themselves
alive
or
to
get
wealth
i
think
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
unnecessary
labour
is
an
old
proverb
about
satan
and
idle
hands
pardon
me
you
alluded
to
that
personage
in
your
letter
proverb
is
a
very
true
one
but
like
other
proverbs
it
applies
to
the
multitude
if
i
get
into
mischief
it
will
not
be
because
i
do
perspire
for
so
many
hours
every
day
but
simply
because
it
is
human
to
err
i
have
no
intention
whatever
of
getting
into
mischief
the
speaker
stroked
his
beard
and
smiled
with
a
distant
look
purpose
is
intensely
selfish
and
all
indulged
selfishness
reacts
on
the
character
replied
miss
barfoot
still
in
a
tone
of
the
friendliest
criticism
dear
cousin
for
anything
to
be
selfish
it
must
be
a
deliberate
refusal
of
what
one
believes
to
be
duty
i
do
admit
that
i
am
neglecting
any
duty
to
others
and
the
duty
to
myself
seems
very
clear
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
exclaimed
the
other
laughing
see
that
you
have
refined
your
arguments
my
arguments
only
i
hope
said
everard
modestly
time
has
been
very
ill
spent
if
i
have
in
some
degree
refined
my
nature
sounds
very
well
everard
but
when
it
comes
to
degrees
of
she
paused
and
made
a
gesture
of
dissatisfaction
comes
to
that
surely
with
every
man
but
we
certainly
shall
not
agree
on
this
subject
you
stand
at
the
social
point
of
view
i
am
an
individualist
you
have
the
advantage
of
a
tolerably
consistent
theory
whilst
i
have
no
theory
at
all
and
am
full
of
contradictions
the
only
thing
clear
to
me
is
that
i
have
a
right
to
make
the
most
of
my
life
matter
at
whose
expense
are
quite
mistaken
my
conscience
is
a
tender
one
i
dread
to
do
any
one
an
injury
that
has
always
been
true
of
me
in
spite
of
your
sceptical
look
and
the
tendency
increases
as
i
grow
older
let
us
have
done
with
so
unimportant
a
matter
is
miss
nunn
able
to
rejoin
us
will
come
presently
i
think
did
you
make
this
lady
acquaintance
miss
barfoot
explained
the
circumstances
makes
an
impression
resumed
everard
strong
character
of
course
more
decidedly
one
of
the
new
women
than
you
yourself
she
am
a
very
woman
women
have
thought
as
i
do
at
any
time
in
history
miss
nunn
has
much
more
zeal
for
womanhood
militant
should
delight
to
talk
with
her
really
you
know
i
am
very
strongly
on
your
side
miss
barfoot
laughed
sophist
you
despise
women
yes
the
great
majority
of
women
the
typical
woman
all
the
more
reason
for
my
admiring
the
exceptions
and
wishing
to
see
them
become
more
common
you
undoubtedly
despise
the
average
woman
despise
no
human
being
everard
in
a
sense
but
miss
nunn
i
feel
sure
would
agree
with
me
am
very
sure
miss
nunn
would
she
does
admire
the
feebler
female
but
that
is
very
far
from
being
at
one
with
point
of
view
my
cousin
everard
mused
with
a
smile
must
get
to
understand
her
line
of
thought
you
permit
me
to
call
upon
you
now
and
then
whenever
you
like
in
the
evening
except
miss
barfoot
added
evening
then
we
are
always
engaged
holidays
are
unknown
to
you
i
suppose
altogether
i
had
mine
a
few
weeks
ago
miss
nunn
will
be
going
away
in
a
fortnight
i
think
just
before
ten
when
barfoot
was
talking
of
some
acquaintances
he
had
left
in
japan
rhoda
entered
the
room
she
seemed
little
disposed
for
conversation
and
everard
did
not
care
to
assail
her
taciturnity
this
evening
he
talked
on
a
little
longer
observing
her
as
she
listened
and
presently
took
an
opportunity
to
rise
for
departure
is
the
forbidden
evening
is
it
not
he
said
to
his
cousin
that
is
devoted
to
business
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
the
friends
exchanged
a
look
each
understood
the
other
as
referring
to
this
point
of
wednesday
evening
but
neither
made
a
remark
they
were
silent
for
some
time
when
rhoda
at
length
spoke
it
was
in
a
tone
of
curiosity
are
sure
you
have
exaggerated
barfoot
failings
the
reply
was
delayed
for
a
moment
was
a
little
indiscreet
to
speak
of
him
at
all
but
no
i
exaggerate
mused
the
other
dispassionately
as
she
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
fender
hardly
strikes
one
as
that
kind
of
man
he
has
certainly
changed
a
great
deal
miss
barfoot
went
on
to
speak
of
her
cousin
resolve
to
pursue
no
calling
means
are
very
modest
i
feel
rather
guilty
before
him
his
father
bequeathed
to
me
much
of
the
money
that
would
in
the
natural
course
have
been
everard
but
he
is
quite
superior
to
any
feeling
of
grudge
on
that
score
his
father
disinherited
him
amounted
to
that
from
quite
a
child
everard
was
at
odds
with
his
father
a
strange
thing
for
in
so
many
respects
they
resembled
each
other
very
closely
physically
everard
is
his
father
walking
the
earth
again
in
character
too
i
think
they
must
be
very
much
alike
they
could
talk
about
the
simplest
thing
without
disagreeing
my
uncle
had
risen
from
the
ranks
but
he
disliked
to
be
reminded
of
it
he
disliked
the
commerce
by
which
he
made
his
fortune
his
desire
was
to
win
social
position
if
baronetcies
could
be
purchased
in
our
time
he
would
have
given
a
huge
sum
to
acquire
one
but
he
never
distinguished
himself
and
one
of
the
reasons
was
no
doubt
that
he
married
too
soon
i
have
heard
him
speak
bitterly
and
very
indiscreetly
of
early
marriages
his
wife
was
dead
then
but
every
one
knew
what
he
meant
rhoda
when
one
thinks
how
often
a
woman
is
a
clog
upon
a
ambition
no
wonder
they
regard
us
as
they
do
course
women
are
always
retarding
one
thing
or
another
but
men
are
intensely
stupid
not
to
have
remedied
that
long
ago
determined
that
his
boys
should
be
gentlemen
tom
the
elder
followed
his
wishes
exactly
he
was
remarkably
clever
but
idleness
spoilt
him
and
now
he
has
made
that
ridiculous
marriage
the
end
of
poor
tom
everard
went
to
eton
and
the
school
had
a
remarkable
effect
upon
him
it
made
him
a
furious
radical
instead
of
imitating
the
young
aristocrats
he
hated
and
scorned
them
there
must
have
been
great
force
of
originality
in
the
boy
of
course
i
do
know
whether
any
etonians
of
his
time
preached
radicalism
but
it
seems
unlikely
i
think
it
was
sheer
vigour
of
character
and
the
strange
desire
to
oppose
his
father
in
everything
from
eton
he
was
of
course
to
pass
to
oxford
but
at
that
stage
came
practical
rebellion
no
said
the
boy
he
would
go
to
a
university
to
fill
his
head
with
useless
learning
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
an
engineer
this
was
an
astonishment
to
every
one
engineering
did
seem
at
all
the
thing
for
him
he
had
very
little
ability
in
mathematics
and
his
bent
had
always
been
to
liberal
studies
but
nothing
could
shake
his
idea
he
had
got
it
into
his
head
that
only
some
such
work
as
engineering
something
of
a
practical
kind
that
called
for
strength
and
craftsmanship
was
worthy
of
a
man
with
his
opinions
he
would
rank
with
the
classes
that
keep
the
world
going
with
their
sturdy
toil
that
was
how
he
spoke
and
after
a
great
fight
he
had
his
way
he
left
eton
to
study
civil
engineering
rhoda
was
listening
with
an
amused
smile
pursued
her
friend
another
display
of
firmness
or
obstinacy
whichever
you
like
to
call
it
he
soon
found
out
that
he
had
made
a
complete
mistake
the
studies
did
suit
him
at
all
as
others
had
foreseen
but
he
would
have
worked
himself
to
death
rather
than
confess
his
error
none
of
us
knew
how
he
was
feeling
till
long
after
engineering
he
had
chosen
and
an
engineer
he
would
be
cost
him
what
effort
it
might
his
father
should
triumph
over
him
and
from
the
age
of
eighteen
till
nearly
thirty
he
stuck
to
a
profession
which
i
am
sure
he
loathed
by
force
of
resolve
he
even
got
on
to
it
and
reached
a
good
position
with
the
firm
he
worked
for
of
course
his
father
would
assist
him
with
money
after
he
came
of
age
he
had
to
make
his
way
just
like
any
young
man
who
has
no
influence
this
puts
him
in
quite
another
light
remarked
rhoda
it
would
be
all
very
well
if
there
were
no
vices
to
add
to
the
picture
i
never
experienced
such
a
revulsion
of
feeling
as
the
day
when
i
learnt
shameful
things
about
everard
you
know
i
always
regarded
him
as
a
boy
and
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
my
younger
brother
then
came
the
shock
a
shock
that
had
a
great
part
in
shaping
my
life
thenceforward
since
i
have
thought
of
him
as
i
have
spoken
of
him
to
you
as
an
illustration
of
evils
we
have
to
combat
a
man
of
the
world
would
tell
you
that
i
grossly
magnified
trifles
it
is
very
likely
that
everard
was
on
a
higher
moral
level
than
most
men
but
i
shall
never
forgive
him
for
destroying
my
faith
in
his
honour
and
nobility
of
feeling
rhoda
had
a
puzzled
look
even
now
you
are
unintentionally
misleading
me
she
said
have
supposed
him
an
outrageous
profligate
was
vicious
and
cowardly
i
ca
say
any
more
that
was
the
immediate
cause
of
his
father
leaving
him
poorly
provided
for
had
much
to
do
with
it
i
have
no
doubt
see
i
imagined
that
he
was
cast
out
of
all
decent
society
society
were
really
decent
he
would
have
been
it
strange
how
completely
his
radicalism
has
disappeared
i
believe
he
never
had
a
genuine
sympathy
with
the
labouring
classes
and
what
more
i
fancy
he
had
a
great
deal
of
his
father
desire
for
command
and
social
distinction
if
he
had
seen
his
way
to
become
a
great
engineer
a
director
of
vast
enterprises
he
would
have
abandoned
his
work
an
incredible
stubbornness
has
possibly
spoilt
his
whole
life
in
a
congenial
pursuit
he
might
by
this
time
have
attained
to
something
noteworthy
it
too
late
now
i
fear
rhoda
meditated
he
aim
at
nothing
whatever
wo
admit
any
ambition
he
has
no
society
his
friends
are
nearly
all
obscure
people
like
those
you
heard
him
speak
of
this
evening
all
what
ambition
should
he
have
said
rhoda
with
a
laugh
one
advantage
in
being
a
woman
a
woman
with
brains
and
will
may
hope
to
distinguish
herself
in
the
greatest
movement
of
our
time
that
of
emancipating
her
sex
but
what
can
a
man
do
unless
he
has
genius
the
emancipation
of
the
working
classes
that
is
the
great
sphere
for
men
and
everard
cares
no
more
for
the
working
classes
than
i
do
it
enough
to
be
free
oneself
mean
that
he
has
task
enough
in
striving
to
be
an
honourable
man
i
hardly
know
what
i
meant
miss
barfoot
mused
and
her
face
lighted
up
with
a
glad
thought
are
right
it
better
to
be
a
woman
in
our
day
with
us
is
all
the
joy
of
advance
the
glory
of
conquering
men
have
only
material
progress
to
think
about
but
we
we
are
winning
souls
propagating
a
new
religion
purifying
the
earth
rhoda
nodded
thrice
cousin
is
a
fine
specimen
of
a
man
after
all
in
body
and
mind
but
what
a
poor
ineffectual
creature
compared
with
rhoda
i
do
flatter
you
dear
i
tell
you
bluntly
of
your
faults
and
extravagances
but
i
am
proud
of
your
magnificent
independence
proud
of
your
pride
dear
and
of
your
stainless
heart
thank
heaven
we
are
women
it
was
rare
indeed
for
miss
barfoot
to
be
moved
to
rhapsody
again
rhoda
nodded
and
then
they
laughed
together
with
joyous
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
their
cause
chapter

seated
in
the
of
a
club
to
which
he
had
newly
procured
admission
everard
barfoot
was
glancing
over
the
advertisement
columns
of
a
literary
paper
his
eye
fell
on
an
announcement
that
had
a
personal
interest
to
him
and
at
once
he
went
to
the
to
pen
a
letter
micklethwaite
i
am
back
in
england
and
ought
before
this
to
have
written
to
you
i
see
you
have
just
published
a
book
with
an
alarming
title
a
treatise
on
trilinear
my
hearty
congratulations
on
the
completion
of
such
a
labour
were
you
not
the
most
disinterested
of
mortals
i
would
add
a
hope
that
it
may
somehow
benefit
you
financially
i
presume
there
people
who
purchase
such
works
but
of
course
the
main
point
with
you
is
to
have
delivered
your
soul
on
trilinear
shall
i
run
down
to
sheffield
to
see
you
or
is
there
any
chance
of
the
holidays
bringing
you
this
way

have
found

cheap
flat
poorly
furnished

who
let

to
be

is
absent
on

for
a
year
or
so

stay

be

old
times

sheffield
the
answer
directed
to
the
club
reached
him
in
three
days
dear
barfoot
i
also
am
in
london
your
letter
has
been
forwarded
from
the
school
which
i
quitted
last
easter
disinterested
or
not
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
i
have
got
a
vastly
better
appointment
let
me
know
when
and
where
to
meet
you
or
if
you
like
come
to
these
lodgings
of
mine
i
do
enter
upon
duties
till
end
of
october
and
am
at
present
revelling
in
mathematical
freedom
there
a
great
deal
to
sincerely
yours
thomas
micklethwaite
having
no
occupation
for
his
morning
barfoot
went
at
once
to
the
obscure
little
street
by
primrose
hill
where
his
friend
was
lodging
he
reached
the
house
about
noon
and
as
he
had
anticipated
found
the
mathematician
deep
in
study
micklethwaite
was
a
man
of
forty
bent
in
the
shoulders
sallow
but
not
otherwise
of
unhealthy
appearance
he
had
a
merry
countenance
a
great
deal
of
lank
disorderly
hair
and
a
beard
that
reached
to
the
middle
of
his
waistcoat
acquaintance
with
him
dated
from
ten
years
ago
when
micklethwaite
had
acted
as
his
private
tutor
in
mathematics
the
room
was
a
musty
little
on
the
ground
floor
perfectly
quiet
declared
its
occupant
that
all
i
care
for
two
other
lodgers
in
the
house
but
they
go
to
business
every
morning
at
eight
and
are
in
bed
by
ten
at
night
besides
it
only
temporary
i
have
great
things
in
view
portentous
changes
i
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
he
insisted
first
of
all
on
hearing
a
full
account
of
history
since
they
both
met
they
had
corresponded
about
twice
a
year
but
everard
was
not
fond
of
and
on
each
occasion
gave
only
the
briefest
account
of
himself
in
listening
micklethwaite
assumed
extraordinary
positions
the
result
presumably
of
a
need
of
physical
exercise
after
hours
spent
over
his
work
now
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
his
arms
extended
above
him
now
he
drew
up
his
legs
fixed
his
feet
on
the
chair
and
locked
his
hands
round
his
knees
thus
perched
he
swayed
his
body
backwards
and
forwards
till
it
seemed
likely
that
he
would
pitch
head
foremost
on
to
the
floor
barfoot
knew
these
eccentricities
of
old
and
paid
no
attention
to
them
what
is
the
appointment
you
have
got
he
asked
at
length
dismissing
his
own
affairs
with
impatience
it
was
that
of
mathematical
lecturer
at
a
london
college
shall
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
and
be
able
to
take
private
pupils
on
two
hundred
at
least
i
can
count
and
there
are
possibilities
i
wo
venture
to
speak
of
because
it
does
do
to
be
too
hopeful
two
hundred
a
year
is
a
great
advance
for
me
enough
i
suppose
said
everard
kindly
not
enough
i
must
make
a
little
more
somehow
why
this
spirit
of
avarice
all
at
once
the
mathematician
gave
a
shrill
cackling
laugh
and
rolled
upon
his
chair
must
have
more
than
two
hundred
i
should
be
satisfied
with
hundred
but
i
take
as
much
more
as
i
can
get
revered
tutor
this
is
shameless
i
came
to
pay
my
respects
to
a
philosopher
and
i
find
a
sordid
worldling
look
at
me
i
am
a
man
of
the
largest
needs
spiritual
and
physical
yet
i
make
my
pittance
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
suffice
and
never
grumble
perhaps
you
aim
at
an
income
equal
to
my
own
do
what
four
hundred
and
fifty
if
you
were
a
man
of
enterprise
you
would
double
or
treble
it
i
put
a
high
value
on
money
i
wish
to
be
are
either
mad
or
are
going
to
get
married
micklethwaite
cackled
louder
than
ever
am
planning
a
new
algebra
for
school
use
if
i
not
much
mistaken
i
can
turn
out
something
that
will
supplant
all
the
present
books
think
if
micklethwaite
algebra
got
accepted
in
all
the
schools
what
would
that
mean
to
mick
hundreds
a
year
my
boy
hundreds
never
knew
you
so
indecent
am
renewing
my
youth
nay
for
the
first
time
i
am
youthful
i
never
had
time
for
it
before
at
the
age
of
sixteen
i
began
to
teach
in
a
school
and
ever
since
i
have
pegged
away
at
it
school
and
private
now
luck
has
come
to
me
and
i
feel
when
i
was
really
i
felt
forty
what
has
that
to
do
with
mick
algebra
would
follow
naturally
mick
arithmetic
euclid
mick
trigonometry
twenty
years
hence
i
should
have
an
income
of
thousands
thousands
i
would
then
cease
to
teach
resign
my
professorship
that
is
to
say
for
of
course
i
should
be
professor
and
devote
myself
to
a
great
work
on
probability
many
a
man
has
begun
the
best
of
his
life
at
sixty
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
it
i
mean
barfoot
was
perplexed
he
knew
his
friend
turn
for
humorous
exaggeration
but
had
never
once
heard
him
scheme
for
material
advancement
and
evidently
this
present
talk
meant
something
more
than
a
jest
i
right
or
not
you
are
going
to
get
married
micklethwaite
glanced
at
the
door
then
said
in
a
tone
of
caution
do
care
to
talk
about
it
here
let
us
go
somewhere
and
eat
together
i
invite
you
to
have
dinner
with
me
or
lunch
as
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
in
your
aristocratic
language
you
had
better
have
lunch
with
me
come
to
my
club
your
impudence
am
i
not
your
father
in
mathematics
so
good
as
to
put
on
a
decent
pair
of
trousers
and
brush
your
hair
ah
here
is
your
trilinear
production
i
look
over
it
whilst
you
make
yourself
presentable
a
bad
misprint
in
the
preface
let
me
show
you
all
the
same
to
me
my
dear
fellow
but
micklethwaite
was
not
content
until
he
had
indicated
the
error
and
had
talked
for
five
minutes
about
the
absurdities
that
it
involved
do
you
suppose
i
got
the
thing
published
he
then
asked
bennet
the
sheffield
headmaster
is
security
for
loss
if
the
book
does
pay
for
itself
in
two
years
time
kind
of
him
was
it
he
pressed
the
offer
upon
me
and
i
think
he
prouder
of
the
book
than
i
am
myself
but
it
quite
remarkable
how
kind
people
are
when
one
is
fortunate
i
fancy
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
is
talked
about
the
enviousness
now
as
soon
as
it
got
known
that
i
was
coming
to
this
post
in
london
people
behaved
to
me
with
surprising
good
nature
all
round
old
bennet
talked
in
quite
an
affectionate
strain
of
course
he
said
i
have
long
known
that
you
ought
to
be
in
a
better
place
than
this
your
payment
is
altogether
inadequate
if
it
had
depended
upon
i
should
long
ago
have
increased
it
i
truly
rejoice
that
you
have
found
a
more
fitting
sphere
for
your
remarkable
abilities
no
i
maintain
that
the
world
is
always
ready
to
congratulate
you
with
sincerity
if
you
will
only
give
it
a
chance
gracious
of
you
to
give
it
the
chance
but
how
did
it
come
about
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
why
about
a
year
ago
i
wrote
an
answer
to
a
communication
signed
by
a
big
gun
in
one
of
the
scientific
papers
it
was
a
question
in
probability
you
would
understand
it
my
answer
was
printed
and
the
big
gun
wrote
privately
to
me
a
very
flattering
letter
that
correspondence
led
to
my
appointment
the
big
gun
exerted
himself
on
my
behalf
the
fact
is
the
world
is
bursting
with
good
nature
and
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
write
this
little
book
only
about
seven
years
the
actual
composition
i
never
had
much
time
to
myself
you
must
remember
a
good
soul
thomas
go
and
equip
yourself
for
civilized
society
to
the
club
they
repaired
on
foot
micklethwaite
would
talk
of
anything
but
that
which
his
companion
most
desired
to
hear
are
solemnities
in
life
he
answered
to
an
impatient
question
that
ca
be
spoken
of
in
the
highway
when
we
have
eaten
let
us
go
to
your
flat
and
there
i
will
tell
you
everything
they
lunched
joyously
the
mathematician
drank
a
bottle
of
excellent
hock
and
did
corresponding
justice
to
the
dishes
his
eyes
gleamed
with
happiness
again
he
enlarged
upon
the
benevolence
of
mankind
and
the
admirable
ordering
of
the
world
from
the
club
they
drove
to
bayswater
and
made
themselves
comfortable
in
barfoot
flat
which
was
very
plainly
but
sufficiently
furnished
micklethwaite
cigar
in
mouth
threw
his
legs
over
the
side
of
the
in
which
he
was
sitting
he
began
gravely
do
mind
telling
you
that
your
conjecture
was
right
i
going
to
be
married
said
the
other
have
reached
the
age
of
discretion
i
must
suppose
that
you
know
what
you
are
about
i
think
i
do
the
story
is
unexciting
i
am
not
a
romantic
person
nor
is
my
future
wife
now
you
must
know
that
when
i
was
about
years
old
i
fell
in
love
you
never
suspected
me
of
that
i
dare
say
not
i
did
fall
in
love
the
lady
was
a
clergyman
daughter
at
hereford
where
i
had
a
place
in
a
school
she
taught
the
infants
in
an
elementary
school
connected
with
ours
her
age
was
exactly
the
same
as
my
own
now
the
remarkable
thing
was
that
she
took
a
liking
for
me
and
when
i
was
scoundrel
enough
to
tell
her
of
my
feeling
she
reject
me
enough
why
scoundrel
but
i
had
a
penny
in
the
world
i
lived
at
the
school
and
received
a
salary
of
thirty
pounds
half
of
which
had
to
go
towards
the
support
of
my
mother
what
could
possibly
have
been
more
villainous
what
earthly
prospect
was
there
of
my
being
able
to
marry
grant
the
monstrosity
of
it
lady
a
very
little
lower
than
the
angels
declared
that
she
was
content
to
wait
an
indefinite
time
she
believed
in
me
and
hoped
for
my
future
her
father
the
mother
was
dead
sanctioned
our
engagement
she
had
three
sisters
one
of
them
a
governess
another
keeping
house
and
the
third
a
blind
girl
excellent
people
all
of
them
i
was
at
their
house
as
often
as
possible
and
they
made
much
of
me
it
was
a
pity
you
know
for
in
those
few
leisure
hours
i
ought
to
have
been
working
like
a
nigger
you
ought
i
left
hereford
and
went
to
a
school
at
gloucester
where
i
had
pounds
how
we
gloried
over
that
extra
five
pounds
but
it
no
use
going
on
with
the
story
in
this
way
it
would
take
me
till
morning
seven
years
went
by
we
were
thirty
years
old
and
no
prospect
whatever
of
our
engagement
coming
to
anything
i
had
worked
pretty
hard
i
had
taken
my
london
degree
but
not
a
penny
had
i
saved
and
all
i
could
spare
was
still
needful
to
my
mother
it
struck
me
all
at
once
that
i
had
no
right
to
continue
the
engagement
on
my
thirtieth
birthday
i
wrote
a
letter
to
fanny
that
is
her
name
and
begged
her
to
be
free
now
would
you
have
done
the
same
or
not
i
am
not
imaginative
enough
to
put
myself
in
such
a
position
it
would
need
a
stupendous
effort
at
all
events
was
there
anything
gross
in
the
proceeding
lady
took
it
ill
in
the
sense
of
being
offended
but
she
said
it
had
caused
her
much
suffering
she
begged
me
to
consider
free
she
would
remain
faithful
and
if
in
time
to
come
i
cared
to
write
to
her
again
after
all
these
years
i
ca
speak
of
it
without
huskiness
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
behaved
more
like
a
scoundrel
than
ever
i
thought
i
had
better
kill
myself
and
even
planned
ways
of
doing
it
i
did
indeed
but
after
all
we
decided
that
our
engagement
should
continue
course
think
it
natural
well
the
engagement
has
continued
till
this
day
a
month
ago
i
was
forty
so
that
we
have
waited
for
seventeen
years
micklethwaite
paused
on
a
note
of
awe
of
fanny
sisters
are
dead
they
never
married
the
blind
one
fanny
has
long
supported
and
she
will
come
to
live
with
us
long
long
ago
we
had
both
of
us
given
up
thought
of
marriage
i
have
never
spoken
to
any
one
of
the
engagement
it
was
something
too
absurd
and
also
too
sacred
the
smile
died
from
everard
face
and
he
sat
in
thought
when
are
going
to
marry
cried
micklethwaite
with
a
revival
of
his
cheerfulness
never
i
think
you
will
neglect
a
grave
duty
yes
it
is
the
duty
of
every
man
who
has
sufficient
means
to
maintain
a
wife
the
life
of
unmarried
women
is
a
wretched
one
every
man
who
is
able
ought
to
save
one
of
them
from
that
fate
should
like
my
cousin
mary
and
her
female
friends
to
hear
you
talk
in
that
way
they
would
overwhelm
you
with
scorn
sincere
scorn
is
my
belief
of
course
i
have
heard
of
that
kind
of
woman
tell
me
something
about
them
barfoot
was
led
on
to
a
broad
expression
of
his
views
admire
your
sentiment
micklethwaite
it
sits
well
on
you
and
you
a
fine
fellow
but
i
have
much
more
sympathy
with
the
new
idea
that
women
should
think
of
marriage
only
as
men
do
i
mean
not
to
grow
up
in
the
thought
that
they
must
marry
or
be
blighted
creatures
my
own
views
are
rather
extreme
perhaps
strictly
i
believe
in
marriage
at
all
and
i
have
anything
like
the
respect
for
women
as
women
that
you
have
you
belong
to
the
ruskin
school
and
i
well
perhaps
my
experience
has
been
unusual
though
i
do
think
so
you
know
that
my
relatives
consider
me
a
blackguard
affair
you
told
me
about
some
years
ago
that
i
have
a
good
mind
to
tell
you
the
true
story
i
care
to
at
the
time
i
accepted
the
charge
of
it
matter
much
my
cousin
will
never
forgive
me
though
she
has
an
air
of
friendliness
once
more
and
i
suspect
she
had
told
her
friend
miss
nunn
all
about
me
perhaps
to
put
miss
nunn
on
her
guard
heaven
knows
he
laughed
merrily
nunn
i
dare
say
needs
no
protection
against
you
had
an
odd
thought
whilst
i
was
there
everard
leaned
his
head
back
and
half
closed
his
eyes
nunn
i
warrant
considers
herself
proof
against
any
kind
of
wooing
she
is
one
of
the
grandly
severe
women
a
terror
i
imagine
to
any
young
girl
at
their
place
who
betrays
weak
thoughts
of
matrimony
now
it
rather
a
temptation
to
a
man
of
my
kind
there
would
be
something
piquant
in
making
vigorous
love
to
miss
nunn
just
to
prove
her
sincerity
micklethwaite
shook
his
head
of
you
barfoot
of
course
you
could
really
do
such
a
thing
such
women
really
challenge
one
if
she
were
rich
i
think
i
could
do
it
without
scruple
seem
to
be
taking
it
for
granted
said
the
mathematician
smiling
this
lady
would
would
respond
to
your
lovemaking
confess
to
you
that
women
have
spoilt
me
and
i
am
rather
resentful
when
any
one
cries
out
against
me
for
lack
of
respect
to
womanhood
i
have
been
the
victim
of
this
groundless
veneration
for
females
now
you
shall
hear
the
story
and
bear
in
mind
that
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
have
ever
told
it
i
never
tried
to
defend
myself
when
i
was
vilified
on
all
hands
probably
the
attempt
would
have
been
useless
and
then
it
would
certainly
have
increased
the
odium
in
which
i
stood
i
think
i
tell
cousin
mary
the
truth
some
day
it
would
be
good
for
her
the
listener
looked
uneasy
but
curious
now
i
was
staying
in
the
summer
with
some
friends
of
ours
at
a
little
place
called
upchurch
on
a
branch
line
from
oxford
the
people
were
goodall
their
name
and
went
in
for
philanthropy
goodall
always
had
a
lot
of
upchurch
girls
about
her
educated
and
not
her
idea
was
to
civilize
one
class
by
means
of
the
other
and
to
give
a
new
spirit
to
both
my
cousin
mary
was
staying
at
the
house
whilst
i
was
there
she
had
more
reasonable
views
than
goodall
but
took
a
great
interest
in
what
was
going
on
one
of
the
girls
in
process
of
spiritualization
was
called
amy
drake
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
i
should
have
met
her
but
she
served
in
a
shop
where
i
went
two
or
three
times
to
get
a
newspaper
we
talked
a
little
with
absolute
propriety
on
my
part
i
assure
you
and
she
knew
that
i
was
a
friend
of
the
goodalls
the
girl
had
no
parents
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
going
to
london
to
live
with
a
married
sister
happened
that
by
the
very
train
which
took
me
back
to
london
when
my
visit
was
over
this
girl
also
travelled
and
alone
i
saw
her
at
upchurch
station
but
we
did
speak
and
i
got
into
a
smoking
carriage
we
had
to
change
at
oxford
and
there
as
i
walked
about
the
platform
amy
put
herself
in
my
way
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
begin
talking
with
her
this
behaviour
rather
surprised
me
i
wondered
what
goodall
would
think
of
it
but
perhaps
it
was
a
sign
of
innocent
freedom
in
the
intercourse
of
men
and
women
at
all
events
amy
managed
to
get
me
into
the
same
carriage
with
herself
and
on
the
way
to
london
we
were
alone
you
foresee
the
end
of
it
at
paddington
station
the
girl
and
i
went
off
together
and
she
did
get
to
her
sister
till
the
evening
course
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
believe
my
account
of
the
matter
miss
drake
was
by
no
means
the
spiritual
young
person
that
goodall
thought
her
or
hoped
to
make
her
plainly
she
was
a
reprobate
of
experience
this
you
will
say
does
alter
the
fact
that
i
also
behaved
like
a
reprobate
no
from
the
moralist
point
of
view
i
was
to
blame
but
i
had
no
moral
pretentions
and
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
i
should
rebuke
the
young
woman
and
preach
her
a
sermon
you
admit
that
i
dare
say
the
mathematician
frowning
uncomfortably
gave
a
nod
of
assent
was
not
only
a
reprobate
but
a
rascal
she
betrayed
me
to
the
people
at
upchurch
and
i
am
quite
sure
meant
from
the
first
to
do
so
imagine
the
outcry
i
had
committed
a
monstrous
crime
had
led
astray
an
innocent
maiden
had
outraged
hospitality
and
so
on
in
amy
case
there
were
awkward
results
of
course
i
must
marry
the
girl
forthwith
but
of
course
i
was
determined
to
do
no
such
thing
for
the
reasons
i
have
explained
i
let
the
storm
break
upon
me
i
had
been
a
fool
to
be
sure
and
could
help
myself
no
one
would
have
believed
my
plea
no
one
would
have
allowed
that
the
truth
was
an
excuse
i
was
abused
on
all
hands
and
when
shortly
after
my
father
made
his
will
and
died
doubtless
he
cut
me
off
with
my
small
annuity
on
this
very
account
my
cousin
mary
got
a
good
deal
of
the
money
that
would
otherwise
have
been
mine
the
old
man
had
been
on
rather
better
terms
with
me
just
before
that
in
a
will
that
he
destroyed
i
believe
he
had
treated
me
handsomely
well
said
micklethwaite
one
knows
there
are
detestable
women
to
be
found
but
you
ought
to
let
this
affect
your
view
of
women
in
general
what
became
of
the
girl
made
her
a
small
allowance
for
a
year
and
a
half
then
her
child
died
and
the
allowance
ceased
i
know
nothing
more
of
her
probably
she
has
inveigled
some
one
into
marriage
barfoot
said
the
other
rolling
about
in
his
chair
opinion
remains
the
same
you
are
in
debt
to
some
worthy
woman
to
the
extent
of
half
your
income
be
quick
and
find
her
it
will
be
better
for
you
do
you
suppose
asked
everard
with
a
smile
of
indulgence
i
could
marry
on
four
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
why
not
impossible
a
wife
be
acceptable
to
me
but
marriage
with
poverty
i
know
myself
and
the
world
too
well
for
that
screamed
the
mathematician
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
poverty
for
married
people
micklethwaite
burst
into
indignant
eloquence
and
everard
sat
listening
with
the
restrained
smile
on
his
lips
chapter
x
first
principles
having
allowed
exactly
a
week
to
go
by
everard
barfoot
made
use
of
his
cousin
permission
and
called
upon
her
at
nine
in
the
evening
miss
barfoot
was
seven
she
and
rhoda
when
alone
rarely
sat
for
more
than
half
an
hour
at
table
and
in
this
summer
season
they
often
went
out
together
at
sunset
to
enjoy
a
walk
along
the
river
this
evening
they
had
returned
only
a
few
minutes
before
everard
ring
sounded
at
the
door
miss
barfoot
they
were
just
entering
the
library
looked
at
her
friend
and
smiled
should
wonder
if
that
is
the
young
man
very
flattering
if
he
has
come
again
so
soon
the
visitor
was
in
mirthful
humour
and
met
with
a
reception
of
corresponding
tone
he
remarked
at
once
that
miss
nunn
had
a
much
pleasanter
aspect
than
a
week
ago
her
smile
was
ready
and
agreeable
she
sat
in
a
sociable
attitude
and
answered
a
jesting
triviality
with
indulgence
of
my
reasons
for
coming
said
everard
to
tell
you
a
remarkable
story
it
connects
he
addressed
his
cousin
our
talk
about
the
matrimonial
disasters
of
those
two
friends
of
mine
do
you
remember
the
name
of
micklethwaite
a
man
who
used
to
cram
me
with
mathematics
i
thought
you
would
he
is
on
the
point
of
marrying
and
his
engagement
has
lasted
just
seventeen
years
wisest
of
your
friends
i
should
say
excellent
fellow
he
is
forty
and
the
lady
the
same
an
astonishing
case
of
constancy
how
is
it
likely
to
turn
out
ca
predict
as
the
lady
is
unknown
to
me
but
he
added
with
facetious
gravity
think
it
likely
that
they
are
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
each
other
nothing
but
sheer
poverty
has
kept
them
apart
pathetic
do
you
think
i
have
a
theory
that
when
an
engagement
has
lasted
ten
years
with
constancy
on
both
sides
and
poverty
still
prevents
marriage
the
state
ought
to
make
provision
for
a
man
in
some
way
according
to
his
social
standing
when
one
thinks
of
it
a
whole
socialistic
system
lies
in
that
suggestion
remarked
rhoda
were
first
provided
that
no
marriage
should
take
place
until
a
ten
years
engagement
barfoot
assented
in
his
smoothest
and
most
graceful
tone
completes
the
system
unless
you
like
to
add
that
no
engagement
is
permitted
except
between
people
who
have
passed
a
certain
examination
equivalent
let
us
say
to
that
which
confers
a
university
degree
and
no
marriage
except
where
both
for
the
whole
decennium
have
earned
their
living
by
work
that
the
state
recognizes
would
that
affect
micklethwaite
betrothed
asked
miss
barfoot
believe
she
has
supported
herself
all
along
by
teaching
course
exclaimed
the
other
impatiently
more
likely
than
not
with
loathing
of
her
occupation
the
usual
kind
of
drudgery
was
it
all
there
must
be
some
one
to
teach
children
to
read
and
write
but
people
who
are
thoroughly
well
trained
for
the
task
and
who
take
a
pleasure
in
it
this
lady
may
be
an
exception
but
i
picture
her
as
having
spent
a
lifetime
of
uncongenial
toil
longing
miserably
for
the
day
when
poor
micklethwaite
was
able
to
offer
her
a
home
that
the
ordinary
and
we
must
abolish
her
altogether
are
you
to
do
that
inquired
everard
suavely
average
man
labours
that
he
may
be
able
to
marry
and
the
average
woman
certainly
has
the
same
end
in
view
are
female
teachers
to
be
vowed
to
celibacy
of
the
kind
but
girls
are
to
be
brought
up
to
a
calling
in
life
just
as
men
are
it
because
they
have
no
calling
that
when
need
comes
they
all
offer
themselves
as
teachers
they
undertake
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
arduous
pursuits
as
if
it
were
as
simple
as
washing
up
dishes
we
ca
earn
money
in
any
other
way
but
we
can
teach
children
a
man
only
becomes
a
schoolmaster
or
tutor
when
he
has
gone
through
laborious
preparation
anything
but
wise
or
adequate
of
course
but
still
conscious
preparation
and
only
a
very
few
men
comparatively
choose
that
line
of
work
women
must
have
just
as
wide
a
choice
plausible
cousin
mary
but
remember
that
when
a
man
chooses
his
calling
he
chooses
it
for
life
a
girl
can
not
but
remember
that
if
she
marries
her
calling
at
once
changes
the
old
business
is
thrown
aside
henceforth
profitless
not
henceforth
profitless
there
the
very
point
i
insist
upon
so
far
is
it
from
profitless
that
it
has
made
her
a
wholly
different
woman
from
what
she
would
otherwise
have
been
instead
of
a
moping
mawkish
creature
with
in
most
instances
a
very
unhealthy
mind
she
is
a
complete
human
being
she
stands
on
an
equality
with
the
man
he
ca
despise
her
as
he
now
does
good
assented
everard
observing
miss
nunn
satisfied
smile
like
that
view
very
much
but
what
about
the
great
number
of
girls
who
are
claimed
by
domestic
duties
do
you
abandon
them
with
a
helpless
sigh
to
be
moping
and
mawkish
and
unhealthy
the
first
place
there
need
be
a
great
number
of
unmarried
women
claimed
by
such
duties
most
of
those
you
are
thinking
of
are
not
fulfilling
a
duty
at
all
they
are
only
pottering
about
the
house
because
they
have
nothing
better
to
do
and
when
the
whole
course
of
female
education
is
altered
when
girls
are
trained
as
a
matter
of
course
to
some
definite
pursuit
then
those
who
really
are
obliged
to
remain
at
home
will
do
their
duty
there
in
quite
a
different
spirit
home
work
will
be
their
serious
business
instead
of
a
disagreeable
drudgery
or
a
way
of
getting
through
the
time
till
marriage
offers
i
would
have
no
girl
however
wealthy
her
parent
grow
up
without
a
profession
there
should
be
no
such
thing
as
a
class
of
females
vulgarized
by
the
necessity
of
finding
daily
amusement
of
males
either
of
course
put
in
everard
stroking
his
beard
of
males
either
cousin
everard
thoroughly
approve
all
this
miss
nunn
yes
but
i
go
further
i
would
have
girls
taught
that
marriage
is
a
thing
to
be
avoided
rather
than
hoped
for
i
would
teach
them
that
for
the
majority
of
women
marriage
means
disgrace
now
do
let
me
understand
you
why
does
it
mean
disgrace
the
majority
of
men
are
without
sense
of
honour
to
be
bound
to
them
in
wedlock
is
shame
and
misery
everard
eyelids
drooped
and
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
you
seriously
think
miss
nunn
that
by
persuading
as
many
women
as
possible
to
abstain
from
marriage
you
will
improve
the
character
of
men
have
no
hope
of
sudden
results
barfoot
i
should
like
to
save
as
many
as
possible
of
the
women
now
living
from
a
life
of
dishonour
but
the
spirit
of
our
work
looks
to
the
future
when
women
high
and
low
alike
are
trained
to
then
men
will
regard
them
in
a
different
light
and
marriage
may
be
honourable
to
both
again
everard
was
silent
and
seemingly
impressed
go
on
with
this
discussion
another
time
said
miss
barfoot
with
cheerful
interruption
do
you
know
somerset
at
all
was
in
that
part
of
england
nunn
is
going
to
take
her
holiday
at
cheddar
and
we
have
been
looking
over
some
photographs
of
that
district
taken
by
her
brother
from
the
table
she
reached
a
scrapbook
and
everard
turned
it
over
with
interest
the
views
were
evidently
made
by
an
amateur
but
in
general
had
no
serious
faults
cheddar
cliffs
were
represented
in
several
aspects
had
no
idea
the
scenery
was
so
fine
cheddar
cheese
has
quite
overshadowed
the
hills
in
my
imagination
this
might
be
a
bit
of
cumberland
or
of
the
highlands
was
my
playground
when
i
was
a
child
said
rhoda
were
born
at
cheddar
at
axbridge
a
little
place
not
far
off
but
i
had
an
uncle
at
cheddar
a
farmer
and
very
often
stayed
with
him
my
brother
is
farming
there
now
here
is
a
view
of
the
what
a
delightful
old
town
of
the
sleepiest
spots
in
england
i
should
say
the
railway
goes
through
it
now
but
has
made
the
slightest
difference
nobody
pulls
down
or
builds
nobody
opens
a
new
shop
nobody
thinks
of
extending
his
trade
a
delicious
place
surely
you
find
no
pleasure
in
that
kind
of
thing
miss
nunn
yes
at
holiday
time
i
shall
doze
there
for
a
fortnight
and
forget
all
about
the
nineteenth
century
can
hardly
believe
it
there
will
be
a
disgraceful
marriage
at
this
beautiful
old
church
and
the
sight
of
it
will
exasperate
you
rhoda
laughed
gaily
it
will
be
a
marriage
of
the
golden
age
perhaps
i
shall
remember
the
bride
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
i
shall
give
her
a
kiss
and
pat
her
on
the
rosy
cheek
and
wish
her
joy
and
the
bridegroom
will
be
such
a
simpleton
unable
to
pronounce
and
i
mind
that
sort
of
marriage
a
bit
the
listeners
were
both
regarding
her
miss
barfoot
with
an
affectionate
smile
everard
with
a
puzzled
searching
look
ending
in
amusement
must
run
down
into
that
country
some
day
said
the
latter
he
did
not
stay
much
longer
but
left
only
because
he
feared
to
burden
the
ladies
with
too
much
of
his
company
again
a
week
passed
and
the
same
evening
found
barfoot
approaching
the
house
in
queen
road
to
his
great
annoyance
he
learnt
that
miss
barfoot
was
not
at
home
she
had
dined
but
afterwards
had
gone
out
he
did
not
venture
to
ask
for
miss
nunn
and
was
moving
disappointedly
away
when
rhoda
herself
returning
from
a
walk
came
up
to
the
door
she
offered
her
hand
gravely
but
with
friendliness
barfoot
i
am
sorry
to
say
has
gone
to
visit
one
of
our
girls
who
is
ill
but
i
think
she
will
very
soon
be
back
will
you
come
in
i
had
so
counted
on
an
hour
talk
rhoda
led
him
to
the
excused
herself
for
a
few
moments
and
came
back
in
her
ordinary
evening
dress
barfoot
noticed
that
her
hair
was
much
more
becomingly
arranged
than
when
he
first
saw
her
so
it
had
been
on
the
last
occasion
but
for
some
reason
its
appearance
attracted
his
eyes
this
evening
he
scrutinized
her
at
discreet
intervals
from
head
to
foot
to
everard
nothing
female
was
alien
woman
merely
as
woman
interested
him
profoundly
and
this
example
of
her
sex
had
excited
his
curiosity
in
no
common
degree
his
concern
with
her
was
purely
intellectual
she
had
no
sensual
attraction
for
him
but
he
longed
to
see
further
into
her
mind
to
probe
the
sincerity
of
the
motives
she
professed
to
understand
her
mechanism
her
process
of
growth
hitherto
he
had
enjoyed
no
opportunity
of
studying
this
type
for
his
cousin
was
a
very
different
person
by
habit
he
regarded
her
as
old
whereas
miss
nunn
in
spite
of
her
thirty
years
could
not
possibly
be
considered
past
youth
he
enjoyed
her
air
of
equality
she
sat
down
with
him
as
a
male
acquaintance
might
have
done
and
he
felt
sure
that
her
behaviour
would
be
the
same
under
any
circumstances
he
delighted
in
the
frankness
of
her
speech
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
regarded
any
subject
as
improper
for
discussion
between
mature
and
serious
people
part
cause
of
this
perhaps
was
her
calm
consciousness
that
she
had
not
a
beautiful
face
no
it
was
not
beautiful
yet
even
at
the
first
meeting
it
did
not
repel
him
studying
her
features
he
saw
how
fine
was
their
expression
the
prominent
forehead
with
its
little
unevenness
that
meant
brains
the
straight
eyebrows
strongly
marked
with
deep
vertical
furrows
generally
drawn
between
them
the
eyes
with
long
lashes
the
nose
thin
and
delicate
the
intellectual
lips
a
protrusion
of
the
lower
one
though
very
slight
marking
itself
when
he
caught
her
profile
the
big
strong
chin
the
shapely
neck
why
after
all
it
was
a
kind
of
beauty
the
head
might
have
been
sculptured
with
fine
effect
and
she
had
a
frame
he
observed
her
strong
wrists
with
exquisite
on
the
pure
white
probably
her
constitution
was
very
sound
she
had
good
teeth
and
a
healthy
brownish
complexion
with
reference
to
the
sick
girl
whom
miss
barfoot
was
visiting
everard
began
what
was
practically
a
resumption
of
their
last
talk
you
a
formal
society
with
rules
and
so
on
no
nothing
of
the
kind
you
of
course
select
the
girls
whom
you
instruct
or
employ
carefully
i
should
like
to
see
them
all
i
mean
he
added
with
a
laugh
would
be
so
very
interesting
the
truth
is
my
sympathies
are
strongly
with
you
in
much
of
what
you
said
the
other
day
about
women
and
marriage
we
regard
the
matter
from
different
points
of
view
but
our
ends
are
the
same
rhoda
moved
her
eyebrows
and
asked
calmly
you
serious
you
are
absorbed
in
your
present
work
that
of
strengthening
women
minds
and
character
for
the
final
issue
of
this
you
ca
care
much
but
to
me
that
is
the
practical
interest
in
my
mind
you
are
working
for
the
happiness
of
men
escaped
rhoda
lips
which
had
curled
in
irony
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
speaking
cynically
or
trivially
the
gain
of
women
is
also
the
gain
of
men
you
are
bitter
against
the
average
man
for
his
low
morality
but
that
fault
on
the
whole
is
directly
traceable
to
the
ignobleness
of
women
think
and
you
will
grant
me
this
see
what
you
mean
men
have
themselves
to
thank
for
it
they
have
i
say
that
i
am
on
your
side
our
civilization
in
this
point
has
always
been
absurdly
defective
men
have
kept
women
at
a
barbarous
stage
of
development
and
then
complain
that
they
are
barbarous
in
the
same
way
society
does
its
best
to
create
a
criminal
class
and
then
rages
against
the
criminals
but
you
see
i
am
one
of
the
men
and
an
impatient
one
too
the
mass
of
women
i
see
about
me
are
so
contemptible
that
in
my
haste
i
use
unjust
language
put
yourself
in
the
man
place
say
that
there
are
a
million
or
so
of
us
very
intelligent
and
highly
educated
well
the
women
of
corresponding
mind
number
perhaps
a
few
thousands
the
vast
majority
of
men
must
make
a
marriage
that
is
doomed
to
be
a
dismal
failure
we
fall
in
love
it
is
true
but
do
we
really
deceive
ourselves
about
the
future
a
very
young
man
may
why
we
know
of
very
young
men
who
are
so
frantic
as
to
marry
girls
of
the
working
class
mere
lumps
of
human
flesh
but
most
of
us
know
that
our
marriage
is
a
at
first
we
are
sad
about
it
then
we
grow
cynical
and
snap
our
fingers
at
moral
obligation
a
bad
case
very
much
worse
instead
of
bravely
bettering
it
but
human
nature
is
human
nature
i
am
only
urging
to
you
the
case
of
average
intelligent
men
as
likely
as
not
so
preposterous
are
our
conventions
you
have
never
heard
it
put
honestly
i
tell
you
the
simple
truth
when
i
say
that
more
than
half
these
men
regard
their
wives
with
active
disgust
they
will
do
anything
to
be
relieved
of
the
sight
of
them
for
as
many
hours
as
possible
at
a
time
if
circumstances
allowed
wives
would
be
abandoned
very
often
indeed
rhoda
laughed
regret
that
it
is
done
prefer
to
say
that
i
approve
it
when
it
is
done
without
disregard
of
common
humanity
there
my
friend
orchard
with
him
it
was
suicide
or
freedom
from
his
hateful
wife
most
happily
he
was
able
to
make
provision
for
her
and
the
children
and
had
strength
to
break
his
bonds
if
he
had
left
them
to
starve
i
should
have
it
but
could
have
approved
it
there
are
men
who
might
follow
his
example
but
prefer
to
put
up
with
a
life
of
torture
well
they
prefer
it
you
see
i
may
think
that
they
are
foolishly
weak
but
i
can
only
recognize
that
they
make
a
choice
between
two
forms
of
suffering
they
have
tender
consciences
the
thought
of
desertion
is
too
painful
to
them
and
in
a
great
number
of
cases
mere
considerations
of
money
and
the
like
keep
a
man
bound
but
conscience
and
habit
detestable
habit
and
fear
of
public
opinion
generally
hold
him
this
is
very
interesting
said
rhoda
with
grave
irony
under
the
head
of
detestable
habit
you
would
put
love
of
children
barfoot
hesitated
a
motive
i
ought
to
have
left
out
yet
i
believe
for
most
men
it
is
represented
by
conscience
the
love
of
children
would
not
generally
in
itself
be
strong
enough
to
outweigh
matrimonial
wretchedness
many
an
intelligent
and
man
has
been
driven
from
his
wife
notwithstanding
thought
for
his
children
he
provides
for
them
as
well
as
he
can
but
and
even
for
their
sakes
he
must
save
himself
the
expression
of
rhoda
countenance
suddenly
changed
an
extreme
mobility
of
facial
muscles
was
one
of
the
things
in
her
that
held
everard
attention
something
in
your
way
of
putting
it
that
i
do
like
she
said
with
much
frankness
of
course
i
agree
with
you
in
the
facts
i
am
convinced
that
most
marriages
are
hateful
from
every
point
of
view
but
there
will
be
no
improvement
until
women
have
revolted
against
marriage
from
a
reasonable
conviction
of
its
hatefulness
wish
you
all
success
most
sincerely
i
do
he
paused
looked
about
the
room
and
stroked
his
ear
then
in
a
grave
tone
own
ideal
of
marriage
involves
perfect
freedom
on
both
sides
of
course
it
could
only
be
realized
where
conditions
are
favourable
poverty
and
other
wretched
things
force
us
so
often
to
sin
against
our
best
beliefs
but
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
might
marry
on
these
ideal
terms
perfect
freedom
sanctioned
by
the
sense
of
intelligent
society
would
abolish
most
of
the
evils
we
have
in
mind
but
women
must
first
be
civilized
you
are
quite
right
in
that
the
door
opened
and
miss
barfoot
came
in
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
and
without
speaking
gave
her
hand
to
everard
is
your
patient
he
asked
little
better
i
think
it
is
nothing
dangerous
here
a
letter
from
your
brother
tom
perhaps
i
had
better
read
it
at
once
there
may
be
news
you
would
like
to
hear
she
sat
down
and
broke
the
envelope
whilst
she
was
reading
the
letter
to
herself
rhoda
quietly
left
the
room
there
is
news
said
miss
barfoot
presently
of
a
disagreeable
kind
a
few
weeks
ago
before
writing
that
is
he
was
thrown
off
a
horse
and
had
a
rib
fractured
how
is
he
going
on
right
again
he
says
and
they
are
coming
back
to
england
his
wife
consumptive
symptoms
have
disappeared
of
course
and
she
is
very
impatient
to
leave
madeira
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
will
allow
poor
tom
time
to
get
his
rib
set
probably
that
consideration
does
weigh
much
with
her
he
says
that
he
is
writing
to
you
by
the
same
mail
old
fellow
said
everard
with
feeling
he
complain
about
his
wife
never
has
done
till
now
but
there
a
sentence
here
that
reads
doubtfully
muriel
he
says
has
been
terribly
upset
about
my
accident
i
ca
persuade
her
that
i
did
get
thrown
on
purpose
yet
i
assure
you
i
did
everard
laughed
old
tom
becomes
ironical
he
must
be
hard
driven
i
have
no
great
longing
to
meet
mrs
thomas
a
silly
and
a
vulgar
woman
but
i
told
him
that
in
plain
terms
before
he
married
it
says
much
for
his
good
nature
that
he
remains
so
friendly
with
me
read
the
letter
everard
he
did
so
very
kind
things
about
me
good
old
tom
why
do
i
marry
well
now
one
would
have
thought
that
his
own
experience
miss
barfoot
began
to
talk
about
something
else
before
very
long
rhoda
came
back
and
in
the
conversation
that
followed
it
was
mentioned
that
she
would
leave
for
her
holiday
in
two
days
have
been
reading
about
cheddar
exclaimed
everard
with
animation
a
flower
grows
among
the
rocks
called
the
cheddar
pink
do
you
know
it
very
well
rhoda
answered
bring
you
some
specimens
you
that
very
kind
a
genuine
pound
or
two
of
the
cheese
rhoda
requested
miss
barfoot
gaily
will
what
they
sell
in
the
shops
there
is
all
sham
barfoot
like
so
much
else
in
this
world
care
nothing
about
the
cheese
that
all
very
well
for
a
person
like
cousin
mary
but
have
a
strong
vein
of
poetry
you
must
have
noticed
it
when
they
shook
hands
will
really
bring
me
the
flowers
everard
said
in
a
voice
sensibly
softened
will
make
a
note
of
it
was
the
reassuring
answer
chapter
xi
at
nature
bidding
the
sick
girl
whom
miss
barfoot
had
been
to
see
was
monica
madden
with
strange
suddenness
after
several
weeks
of
steady
application
to
her
work
in
a
cheerful
spirit
which
at
times
rose
to
gaiety
monica
became
dull
remiss
unhappy
then
violent
headaches
attacked
her
and
one
morning
she
declared
herself
unable
to
rise
mildred
vesper
went
to
great
portland
street
at
the
usual
hour
and
informed
miss
barfoot
of
her
companion
illness
a
doctor
was
summoned
to
him
it
seemed
probable
that
the
girl
was
suffering
from
consequences
of
overstrain
at
her
old
employment
there
was
nervous
collapse
hysteria
general
disorder
of
the
system
had
the
patient
any
mental
disquietude
was
trouble
of
any
kind
the
doctor
smiled
weighing
upon
her
miss
barfoot
unable
to
answer
these
questions
held
private
colloquy
with
mildred
but
the
latter
though
she
pondered
a
good
deal
with
corrugated
brows
could
furnish
no
information
in
a
day
or
two
monica
was
removed
to
her
sister
lodgings
at
lavender
hill
conisbee
managed
to
put
a
room
at
her
disposal
and
virginia
tended
her
thither
miss
barfoot
went
on
the
evening
when
everard
found
her
away
she
and
virginia
talking
together
after
being
with
the
invalid
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
agreed
that
there
was
considerable
improvement
but
felt
a
like
uneasiness
regarding
monica
state
of
mind
you
think
asked
the
visitor
she
regrets
the
step
i
persuaded
her
to
take
i
think
that
she
has
been
so
delighted
with
her
progress
each
time
i
have
seen
her
no
i
feel
sure
it
only
the
results
of
what
she
suffered
at
walworth
road
in
a
very
short
time
we
shall
have
her
at
work
again
and
brighter
than
ever
miss
barfoot
was
not
convinced
after
everard
departure
that
evening
she
talked
of
the
matter
with
rhoda
afraid
said
miss
nunn
monica
is
rather
a
silly
girl
she
does
know
her
own
mind
if
this
kind
of
thing
is
repeated
we
had
better
send
her
back
to
the
country
shop
work
again
might
be
better
i
do
like
the
thought
of
that
rhoda
had
one
of
her
fits
of
wrathful
eloquence
could
one
have
a
better
instance
than
this
madden
family
of
the
crime
that
parents
commit
when
they
allow
their
girls
to
go
without
rational
training
of
course
i
know
that
monica
was
only
a
little
child
when
they
were
left
orphans
but
her
sisters
had
already
grown
up
into
uselessness
and
their
example
has
been
harmful
to
her
all
along
her
guardians
dealt
with
her
absurdly
they
made
her
half
a
lady
and
half
a
i
do
think
she
ever
be
good
for
much
and
the
elder
ones
will
go
on
just
keeping
themselves
alive
you
can
see
that
they
never
start
the
school
that
there
so
much
talk
of
that
poor
helpless
foolish
virginia
alone
there
in
her
miserable
lodging
how
can
we
hope
that
any
one
will
take
her
as
a
companion
and
yet
they
are
capitalists
eight
hundred
pounds
between
them
think
what
capable
women
might
do
with
eight
hundred
pounds
am
really
afraid
to
urge
them
to
meddle
with
the
investments
course
so
am
i
one
is
afraid
to
do
or
propose
anything
virginia
is
starving
be
starving
poor
creature
i
can
never
forget
how
her
eyes
shone
when
i
put
that
joint
of
meat
before
her
do
do
wish
sighed
miss
barfoot
with
a
pained
smile
i
knew
some
honest
man
who
would
be
likely
to
fall
in
love
with
little
monica
in
spite
of
you
my
dear
i
would
devote
myself
to
making
the
match
but
there
no
one
i
would
help
laughed
rhoda
not
unkindly
fit
for
nothing
else
i
afraid
we
must
look
for
any
kind
of
heroism
in
monica
less
than
half
an
hour
after
miss
barfoot
had
left
the
house
at
lavender
hill
mildred
vesper
made
a
call
there
it
was
about
nine
the
invalid
after
sitting
up
since
midday
had
gone
to
bed
but
could
not
sleep
summoned
to
the
virginia
acquainted
miss
vesper
with
the
state
of
affairs
think
you
might
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
should
like
to
if
you
please
miss
madden
replied
mildred
who
had
a
rather
uneasy
look
she
went
upstairs
and
entered
the
bedroom
where
a
lamp
was
burning
at
the
sight
of
her
friend
monica
showed
much
satisfaction
they
kissed
each
other
affectionately
old
girl
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
come
back
tomorrow
or
at
all
events
the
day
after
it
so
frightfully
dull
here
oh
and
i
wanted
to
know
if
anything
any
letter
had
come
for
me
just
why
i
came
to
see
you
mildred
took
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
half
averted
her
face
as
she
handed
it
nothing
particular
said
monica
putting
it
away
under
her
pillow
you
dear
but
her
cheeks
had
become
hot
and
she
trembled
would
care
to
tell
me
about
anything
you
do
think
it
would
make
your
mind
easier
for
a
minute
monica
lay
back
gazing
at
the
wall
then
she
looked
round
quickly
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
very
silly
of
me
not
to
have
told
you
long
before
this
but
you
so
sensible
i
was
afraid
i
tell
you
everything
not
now
but
as
soon
as
i
get
to
rutland
street
i
shall
come
you
think
you
can
you
look
dreadfully
bad
still
sha
get
any
better
here
replied
the
invalid
in
a
whisper
virgie
does
depress
me
so
she
does
understand
that
i
ca
bear
to
hear
her
repeating
the
kind
of
things
she
has
heard
from
miss
barfoot
and
miss
nunn
she
tries
so
hard
to
look
forward
hopefully
but
i
she
is
miserable
and
it
makes
me
more
miserable
still
i
ought
to
have
left
you
i
should
have
been
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
with
you
to
help
me
you
do
milly
it
all
real
and
natural
good
spirits
it
has
done
me
good
only
to
see
your
dear
old
face
you
a
flatterer
and
do
you
really
feel
better
much
better
i
shall
go
to
sleep
very
soon
the
visitor
took
her
leave
when
a
few
minutes
after
monica
had
bidden
to
her
sister
requesting
that
the
lamp
might
be
left
she
read
what
mildred
had
brought
dearest
monica
the
missive
began
have
you
not
written
before
this
i
have
been
dreadfully
uneasy
ever
since
receiving
your
last
letter
your
headache
soon
went
away
i
hope
why
have
you
made
another
appointment
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
keep
from
breaking
my
promise
and
coming
to
ask
about
you
write
at
once
i
implore
you
my
dearest
it
no
use
telling
me
that
i
must
not
use
these
words
of
affection
they
come
to
my
lips
and
to
my
pen
irresistibly
you
know
so
well
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
ca
address
you
like
i
did
when
we
first
corresponded
my
darling
my
dear
sweet
beautiful
little
girl
four
close
pages
of
this
with
scarce
room
at
the
end
for
when
she
had
gone
through
it
monica
turned
her
face
upon
the
pillow
and
lay
so
for
a
long
time
a
clock
in
the
house
struck
eleven
this
roused
her
and
she
slipped
out
of
the
bed
to
hide
the
letter
in
her
not
long
after
she
was
asleep
the
next
day
on
returning
from
her
work
and
opening
the
door
mildred
vesper
was
greeted
with
a
merry
laugh
monica
had
been
here
since
three
and
had
made
tea
in
readiness
for
her
friend
arrival
she
looked
very
white
but
her
eyes
gleamed
with
pleasure
and
she
moved
about
the
room
as
actively
as
before
came
with
me
but
she
would
stay
she
says
she
has
a
most
important
letter
to
write
to
alice
about
the
school
of
course
oh
that
school
i
do
wish
they
could
make
up
their
minds
i
told
them
they
may
have
all
my
money
if
they
like
you
i
should
like
the
sensation
of
offering
hundreds
of
pounds
to
some
one
it
must
give
a
strange
feeling
of
dignity
and
importance
only
hundred
a
wretched
little
sum
are
a
person
of
large
ideas
as
i
have
often
told
you
where
did
you
get
them
i
wonder
put
on
that
face
it
the
one
i
like
least
of
all
your
many
faces
it
suspicious
mildred
went
to
take
off
her
things
and
was
quickly
at
the
she
had
a
somewhat
graver
look
than
usual
and
chose
rather
to
listen
than
talk
not
long
after
tea
when
there
had
been
a
long
and
unnatural
silence
mildred
making
pretence
of
absorption
in
a
and
her
companion
standing
at
the
window
whence
she
threw
back
furtive
glances
the
thunder
of
a
postman
knock
downstairs
caused
both
of
them
to
start
and
look
at
each
other
in
a
way
may
be
for
me
said
monica
stepping
to
the
door
go
and
look
her
conjecture
was
right
another
letter
from
widdowson
still
more
alarmed
and
vehement
than
the
last
she
read
it
rapidly
on
the
staircase
and
entered
the
room
with
sheet
and
envelope
squeezed
together
in
her
hand
going
to
tell
you
all
about
this
milly
the
other
nodded
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
sober
attention
in
relating
her
story
monica
moved
hither
and
thither
now
playing
with
objects
on
the
mantlepiece
now
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
hands
locked
nervously
behind
her
throughout
her
manner
was
that
of
defence
she
seemed
doubtful
of
herself
and
anxious
to
represent
the
case
as
favourably
as
possible
not
for
a
moment
had
her
voice
the
ring
of
courageous
passion
nor
the
softness
of
tender
feeling
the
narrative
hung
together
but
awkwardly
and
in
truth
gave
a
very
indistinct
notion
of
how
she
had
comported
herself
at
the
various
stages
of
the
irregular
courtship
her
behaviour
had
been
marked
by
far
more
delicacy
and
scruple
than
she
succeeded
in
representing
painfully
conscious
of
this
she
exclaimed
at
length
see
your
opinion
of
me
has
suffered
you
do
like
this
story
you
wonder
how
i
could
do
such
things
dear
i
certainly
wonder
how
you
could
begin
mildred
made
answer
with
her
natural
directness
but
gently
of
course
it
was
different
when
you
had
once
got
to
be
sure
that
he
was
a
gentleman
was
sure
of
that
so
soon
exclaimed
monica
her
cheeks
still
red
will
understand
it
much
better
when
you
have
seen
him
wish
me
to
am
going
to
write
now
and
say
that
i
will
marry
him
they
looked
long
at
each
other
are
really
i
made
up
my
mind
last
night
monica
you
must
mind
my
speaking
plainly
i
do
think
you
love
him
i
love
him
well
enough
to
feel
that
i
am
doing
right
in
marrying
him
she
sat
down
by
the
table
and
propped
her
head
on
her
hand
loves
me
i
ca
doubt
that
if
you
could
read
his
letters
you
would
see
how
strong
his
feeling
is
she
shook
with
the
cold
induced
by
excitement
her
voice
was
at
moments
all
but
choked
putting
love
aside
went
on
the
other
very
gravely
do
you
really
know
of
widdowson
nothing
whatever
but
what
he
has
told
you
himself
of
course
you
will
let
your
friends
make
inquiries
for
you
i
shall
tell
my
sisters
and
no
doubt
they
will
go
to
miss
nunn
at
once
i
do
want
to
do
anything
rash
but
it
will
be
all
right
i
mean
he
has
told
me
the
truth
about
everything
you
would
be
sure
of
that
if
you
knew
him
mildred
with
hands
before
her
on
the
table
made
the
tips
of
her
fingers
meet
her
lips
were
drawn
in
her
eyes
seemed
looking
for
something
minute
on
the
cloth
know
she
said
at
length
suspected
what
was
going
on
i
could
help
course
you
could
i
thought
it
was
some
one
whose
acquaintance
you
had
made
at
the
shop
i
think
of
marrying
any
one
of
that
kind
should
have
been
grieved
may
believe
me
milly
widdowson
is
a
man
you
will
respect
and
like
as
soon
as
you
know
him
he
could
have
behaved
to
me
with
more
delicacy
not
a
word
from
him
spoken
or
written
has
ever
pained
me
except
that
he
tells
me
he
suffers
so
dreadfully
and
of
course
i
ca
hear
that
without
pain
respect
and
even
to
like
a
man
is
at
all
the
same
as
loving
him
said
would
respect
and
like
him
exclaimed
monica
with
humorous
impatience
do
want
to
love
him
mildred
laughed
with
constraint
never
loved
any
one
yet
dear
and
it
very
unlikely
i
ever
shall
but
i
think
i
know
the
signs
of
the
feeling
monica
came
behind
her
and
leaned
upon
her
shoulder
loves
me
so
much
that
he
has
made
me
think
i
marry
him
and
i
am
glad
of
it
i
not
like
you
milly
i
ca
be
contented
with
this
life
miss
barfoot
and
miss
nunn
are
very
sensible
and
good
people
and
i
admire
them
very
much
but
i
go
their
way
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
dreadful
dreadful
to
live
one
life
alone
do
turn
round
and
snap
at
me
i
want
to
tell
you
the
truth
whilst
you
ca
see
me
whenever
i
think
of
alice
and
virginia
i
am
frightened
i
had
rather
oh
far
rather
kill
myself
than
live
such
a
life
at
their
age
you
ca
imagine
how
miserable
they
are
really
and
i
have
the
same
nature
as
theirs
you
know
compared
with
you
and
miss
haven
i
very
weak
and
childish
after
drumming
on
the
table
for
a
moment
with
wrinkled
brows
mildred
made
grave
response
must
let
tell
the
truth
as
well
i
think
you
going
to
marry
with
altogether
wrong
ideas
i
think
you
do
an
injustice
to
widdowson
you
will
marry
him
for
a
comfortable
home
that
what
it
amounts
to
and
you
repent
it
bitterly
some
day
you
repent
monica
raised
herself
and
stood
apart
one
thing
pursued
mildred
with
nervous
earnestness
too
old
your
habits
and
his
wo
suit
has
assured
me
that
i
shall
live
exactly
the
kind
of
life
i
please
and
that
will
be
what
pleases
i
feel
his
kindness
to
me
very
much
and
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
repay
him
a
very
nice
spirit
but
i
believe
married
life
is
no
easy
thing
even
when
the
people
are
well
matched
i
have
heard
the
most
dreadful
stories
of
quarrelling
and
all
sorts
of
unhappiness
between
people
i
thought
safe
from
any
such
dangers
you
be
fortunate
i
only
say
that
the
chances
are
very
much
against
it
marrying
from
such
motives
as
you
confess
monica
drew
herself
up
have
confessed
any
motive
to
be
ashamed
of
milly
say
you
have
decided
to
marry
now
because
you
are
afraid
of
never
having
another
chance
that
turning
it
very
unkindly
i
only
said
that
i
had
told
you
that
i
did
love
him
and
i
do
love
him
he
has
made
me
love
him
i
have
no
right
to
say
any
more
i
can
only
wish
you
happiness
mildred
heaved
a
sigh
and
pretended
to
give
her
attention
to
maunder
after
waiting
irresolutely
for
some
minutes
monica
looked
for
notepaper
and
took
it
together
with
her
inkstand
into
the
bedroom
she
was
absent
half
an
hour
on
her
return
there
was
a
stamped
letter
in
her
hand
is
going
milly
well
dear
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
give
me
up
for
lost
we
shall
see
it
was
spoken
again
she
left
the
room
put
on
her
things
and
went
to
post
the
letter
by
this
time
she
began
to
feel
the
results
of
exertion
and
excitement
headache
and
tremulous
failing
of
her
strength
obliged
her
to
go
to
bed
almost
as
soon
as
she
returned
mildred
waited
upon
her
with
undiminished
kindness
all
right
monica
murmured
as
her
head
sank
on
the
pillow
feel
so
relieved
and
so
glad
so
happy
now
i
have
done
it
dear
replied
the
other
with
a
kiss
and
went
back
to
her
semblance
of
reading
two
days
later
monica
called
unexpectedly
at
conisbee
being
told
by
that
worthy
woman
that
miss
madden
was
at
home
she
ran
upstairs
and
tapped
at
the
door
virginia
voice
inquired
hurriedly
who
was
there
and
on
monica
announcing
herself
there
followed
a
startled
exclamation
a
minute
my
love
only
a
minute
when
the
door
opened
monica
was
surprised
by
a
disorder
in
her
appearance
virginia
had
flushed
cheeks
curiously
vague
eyes
and
hair
ruffled
as
if
she
had
just
risen
from
a
nap
she
began
to
talk
in
a
hurried
disconnected
way
trying
to
explain
that
she
had
not
been
quite
well
and
was
not
yet
properly
dressed
a
strange
smell
monica
exclaimed
looking
about
the
room
like
brandy
notice
it
i
have
i
was
obliged
to
get
to
ask
conisbee
for
i
do
want
to
alarm
you
dear
but
i
felt
rather
faint
indeed
i
thought
i
should
have
a
fainting
fit
i
was
obliged
to
call
conisbee
but
do
think
anything
about
it
it
all
over
the
weather
is
very
trying
she
laughed
nervously
and
began
to
pat
monica
hand
the
girl
was
not
quite
satisfied
and
pressed
many
questions
but
in
the
end
she
accepted
virginia
assurances
that
nothing
serious
had
happened
then
her
own
business
occupied
her
she
sat
down
and
said
with
a
smile
have
brought
you
astonishing
news
if
you
did
faint
before
be
very
likely
to
do
so
now
her
sister
exhibited
fresh
agitation
and
begged
not
to
be
kept
in
suspense
nerves
are
in
a
shocking
state
it
be
the
weather
what
you
have
to
tell
me
monica
think
i
sha
need
to
go
on
with
typewriting
what
are
you
going
to
do
child
the
other
asked
sharply
i
am
going
to
be
married
the
shock
was
a
severe
one
virginia
hands
fell
her
eyes
started
her
mouth
opened
she
became
the
colour
of
clay
even
her
lips
losing
for
the
moment
all
their
colour
she
at
length
gasped
who
is
it
one
you
have
never
heard
of
his
name
is
edmund
widdowson
he
is
very
well
off
and
has
a
house
at
herne
hill
private
gentleman
he
used
to
be
in
business
but
is
retired
now
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
much
more
about
him
until
you
have
made
his
acquaintance
do
ask
a
lot
of
questions
you
are
to
come
with
me
this
afternoon
to
his
house
he
lives
alone
but
a
relative
of
his
his
is
going
to
be
with
him
to
meet
us
but
it
so
sudden
i
ca
go
to
pay
a
call
like
that
at
a
moment
notice
impossible
darling
what
it
all
mean
you
are
going
to
be
married
monica
i
ca
understand
it
i
ca
realize
it
who
is
this
gentleman
how
long
you
wo
get
me
to
tell
you
more
than
i
have
done
till
you
have
seen
him
what
you
told
me
i
could
grasp
it
i
am
quite
confused
what
was
the
name
it
took
half
an
hour
to
familiarize
virginia
with
the
simple
fact
when
she
was
convinced
of
its
truth
a
paroxysm
of
delight
appeared
in
her
she
laughed
uttered
cries
of
joy
even
clapped
her
hands
to
be
married
a
private
gentleman
a
large
fortune
my
darling
how
shall
i
ever
believe
it
yet
i
felt
so
sure
that
the
day
would
come
what
alice
say
and
rhoda
nunn
have
you
have
you
ventured
to
tell
her
that
i
have
i
want
you
to
do
that
you
shall
go
and
see
them
as
it
sunday
the
delight
alice
wo
be
able
to
contain
herself
we
always
said
the
day
would
come
wo
have
any
more
anxieties
virgie
you
can
take
the
school
or
not
as
you
like
widdowson
my
dear
interposed
virginia
with
sudden
dignity
shall
certainly
open
the
school
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
is
to
be
our
life
work
it
is
far
far
more
than
a
mere
means
of
subsistence
but
perhaps
we
shall
not
need
to
hurry
everything
can
be
matured
at
our
leisure
if
you
would
only
just
tell
me
darling
when
you
were
first
introduced
monica
laughed
gaily
and
refused
to
explain
it
was
time
for
virginia
to
make
herself
ready
and
here
arose
a
new
perturbation
what
had
she
suitable
for
wear
under
such
circumstances
monica
had
decked
herself
a
little
and
helped
the
other
to
make
the
best
of
her
narrow
resources
at
four
they
set
out
chapter
xii
weddings
when
they
reached
the
house
at
herne
hill
the
sisters
were
both
in
a
state
of
nervous
tremor
monica
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
the
kind
of
person
luke
widdowson
would
prove
to
be
and
virginia
seemed
to
herself
to
be
walking
in
a
dream
you
been
here
often
whispered
the
latter
as
soon
as
they
came
in
view
of
the
place
its
aspect
delighted
her
but
the
conflict
of
her
emotions
was
so
disturbing
that
she
had
to
pause
and
seek
the
support
of
her
sister
arm
never
been
inside
monica
answered
indistinctly
we
shall
be
unpunctual
do
wish
you
would
tell
me
dear
ca
talk
virgie
try
and
keep
quiet
and
behave
as
if
it
were
all
quite
natural
this
was
altogether
beyond
virginia
power
it
happened
most
luckily
though
greatly
to
widdowson
annoyance
that
the
luke
widdowson
arrived
nearly
half
an
hour
later
than
the
time
she
had
appointed
led
by
the
servant
into
a
comfortable
the
visitors
were
received
by
the
master
of
the
house
alone
with
a
grim
smile
the
result
of
his
embarrassment
with
profuse
apologies
and
a
courtesy
altogether
excessive
widdowson
did
his
best
to
put
them
at
their
ease
of
course
with
small
result
the
sisters
side
by
side
on
a
settee
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
the
host
seated
far
away
from
them
they
talked
with
scarcely
any
understanding
of
what
was
said
on
either
side
the
weather
and
the
vastness
of
london
serving
as
topics
until
of
a
sudden
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
there
appeared
a
person
of
such
imposing
presence
that
virginia
gave
a
start
and
monica
gazed
in
painful
fascination
luke
was
a
tall
and
portly
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
with
rather
a
high
colour
her
features
were
handsome
but
without
much
refinement
their
expression
a
condescending
her
mourning
garb
if
mourning
it
could
be
called
represented
an
extreme
of
the
prevailing
fashion
its
glint
and
rustle
inspired
awe
in
the
female
observer
a
moment
ago
the
had
seemed
empty
luke
in
her
sole
person
filled
and
illumined
it
widdowson
addressed
this
resplendent
personage
by
her
christian
name
his
familiarity
exciting
in
monica
an
irrational
surprise
he
presented
the
sisters
to
her
and
luke
bowing
grandly
at
a
distance
drew
from
her
bosom
a
through
which
she
scrutinized
monica
the
smile
which
followed
might
have
been
interpreted
in
several
senses
widdowson
alone
capable
of
remarking
it
answered
with
a
look
of
severe
dignity
luke
had
no
thought
of
apologizing
for
the
lateness
of
her
arrival
and
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
intend
to
stay
long
her
purpose
seemed
to
be
to
make
the
occasion
as
informal
as
possible
you
by
chance
know
the
hodgson
bulls
she
asked
of
her
relative
interrupting
him
in
the
nervous
commonplaces
with
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
smooth
the
way
to
a
general
conversation
she
had
the
accent
of
cultivation
but
spoke
rather
imperiously
never
heard
of
them
was
the
cold
reply
they
live
somewhere
about
here
i
have
to
make
a
call
on
them
i
suppose
my
coachman
will
find
the
place
there
was
an
awkward
silence
widdowson
was
about
to
say
something
to
monica
when
luke
who
had
again
closely
observed
the
girl
through
the
glasses
interposed
in
a
gentle
tone
you
like
this
neighbourhood
miss
madden
monica
gave
the
expected
answer
her
voice
sounding
very
weak
and
timid
by
comparison
and
so
for
some
ten
minutes
an
appearance
of
dialogue
was
sustained
luke
though
still
condescending
evinced
a
desire
to
be
agreeable
she
smiled
and
nodded
in
reply
to
the
girl
remarks
and
occasionally
addressed
virginia
with
careful
civility
conveying
the
impression
perhaps
involuntarily
that
she
commiserated
the
shy
and
person
tea
was
brought
in
and
after
pretending
to
take
a
cup
she
rose
for
departure
you
will
come
and
see
me
some
day
miss
madden
fell
from
her
with
unanticipated
graciousness
as
she
stepped
forward
to
the
girl
and
offered
her
hand
must
bring
you
at
some
quiet
time
when
we
can
talk
very
glad
to
have
met
you
very
glad
indeed
and
the
personage
was
gone
they
heard
her
carriage
roll
away
from
beneath
the
window
all
three
drew
a
breath
of
relief
and
widdowson
suddenly
quite
another
man
took
a
place
near
to
virginia
with
whom
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
conversing
in
the
friendliest
way
virginia
experiencing
a
like
relief
also
became
herself
she
found
courage
to
ask
needful
questions
which
in
every
case
were
satisfactorily
met
of
luke
there
was
no
word
but
when
they
had
taken
their
leave
the
visit
lasted
altogether
some
two
hours
monica
and
her
sister
discussed
that
great
lady
with
the
utmost
freedom
they
agreed
that
she
was
personally
detestable
very
rich
my
dear
said
virginia
in
a
murmuring
voice
can
see
that
i
have
met
such
people
before
they
have
a
manner
oh
of
course
widdowson
will
take
you
to
call
upon
her
nobody
else
is
likely
to
be
there
that
what
she
meant
remarked
monica
coldly
mind
my
love
you
do
wish
for
grand
society
i
am
very
glad
to
tell
you
that
edmund
impresses
me
very
favourably
he
is
reserved
but
that
is
no
fault
oh
we
must
write
to
alice
at
once
her
surprise
her
delight
when
on
the
next
day
monica
met
her
betrothed
in
regent
park
she
still
lived
with
mildred
vesper
but
no
longer
went
to
great
portland
street
their
talk
was
naturally
of
luke
widdowson
speedily
led
to
the
topic
had
told
you
he
said
with
careful
accent
i
see
very
little
of
her
i
ca
say
that
i
like
her
but
she
is
a
very
difficult
person
to
understand
and
i
fancy
she
often
gives
offence
when
she
does
at
all
mean
it
still
i
hope
you
were
not
displeased
monica
avoided
a
direct
answer
you
take
me
to
see
her
were
her
words
you
will
go
dear
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
be
present
at
our
wedding
unfortunately
she
my
only
relative
or
the
only
one
i
know
anything
about
after
our
marriage
i
do
think
we
shall
see
much
of
her
i
dare
say
not
was
monica
remark
and
thereupon
they
turned
to
pleasanter
themes
that
morning
widdowson
had
received
from
his
a
scribbled
asking
him
to
call
upon
luke
early
the
day
that
followed
of
course
this
meant
that
the
lady
was
desirous
of
further
talk
concerning
miss
madden
unwillingly
but
as
a
matter
of
duty
he
kept
the
appointment
it
was
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
when
admitted
to
the
flat
in
victoria
street
which
was
his
relative
abode
he
had
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
the
lady
appearance
luxurious
fashion
as
might
have
been
expected
distinguished
luke
costly
and
beautiful
things
superabounded
perfume
soothed
the
air
only
since
her
bereavement
had
widdowson
been
able
to
indulge
this
taste
for
modern
exuberance
in
domestic
adornment
the
deceased
luke
was
a
plain
man
of
business
who
clung
to
the
fashions
which
had
been
familiar
to
him
in
his
youth
his
second
wife
found
a
suburban
house
already
furnished
and
her
influence
with
him
could
not
prevail
to
banish
the
horrors
amid
which
he
chose
to
live
chairs
in
maroon
rep
brussels
carpets
of
red
roses
on
a
green
ground
sofas
of
the
most
uncomfortable
shape
ever
designed
antimacassars
everywhere
chimney
ornaments
of
cut
glass
trembling
in
sympathy
with
the
kindred
chandeliers
she
belonged
to
an
obscure
branch
of
a
house
that
culminated
in
an
obscure
baronetcy
penniless
and
ambitious
she
had
to
thank
her
imposing
physique
for
rescue
at
a
perilous
age
and
though
despising
luke
widdowson
for
his
plebeian
tastes
she
shrewdly
retained
the
of
a
husband
who
seemed
no
candidate
for
length
of
years
the
died
much
sooner
than
she
could
reasonably
have
hoped
and
left
her
an
income
of
four
thousand
pounds
thereupon
began
for
luke
a
life
of
feverish
aspiration
the
baronetcy
to
which
she
was
akin
had
inspired
her
even
from
childhood
with
an
aristocratic
ideal
a
handsome
widow
of
only
she
resolved
that
her
wealth
should
pave
the
way
for
her
to
a
titled
alliance
her
acquaintance
lay
among
city
people
but
with
the
opportunities
of
freedom
it
was
soon
extended
to
the
sphere
of
what
is
known
as
smart
society
her
flat
in
victoria
street
attracted
a
heterogeneous
cluster
of
and
among
them
one
or
two
vagrant
members
of
the
younger
aristocracy
she
lived
at
the
utmost
pace
compatible
with
technical
virtue
when
as
shortly
happened
it
became
evident
that
her
income
was
not
large
enough
for
her
serious
purpose
she
took
counsel
with
an
old
friend
great
in
finance
and
thenceforth
the
excitement
of
the
gambler
gave
a
new
zest
to
her
turbid
existence
like
most
of
her
female
associates
she
had
free
recourse
to
the
bottle
but
for
such
stimulus
the
life
of
a
smart
woman
would
be
physically
impossible
and
luke
enjoyed
life
enjoyed
it
vastly
the
goal
of
her
ambition
if
all
went
well
in
the
city
was
quite
within
reasonable
hope
she
foretasted
the
day
when
a
vulgar
prefix
would
no
longer
attach
to
her
name
and
when
the
journals
of
society
would
reflect
her
rising
effulgence
widdowson
was
growing
impatient
when
his
relative
at
length
appeared
she
threw
herself
into
a
deep
chair
crossed
her
legs
and
gazed
at
him
mockingly
it
is
quite
so
bad
as
i
feared
edmund
do
you
mean
she
a
decent
enough
little
girl
i
can
see
but
you
a
silly
fellow
for
all
that
you
could
have
deceived
me
you
know
if
there
been
anything
you
understand
i
should
have
spotted
it
at
once
do
relish
this
kind
of
talk
observed
widdowson
acidly
plain
english
you
supposed
i
was
going
to
marry
some
one
about
whom
i
could
confess
the
truth
course
i
did
now
come
tell
me
how
you
got
to
know
her
the
man
moved
uneasily
but
in
the
end
related
the
whole
story
luke
kept
nodding
with
an
amused
air
yes
she
managed
it
capitally
clever
little
witch
fetching
eyes
she
has
you
sent
for
me
to
make
insulting
remarks
i
come
to
the
wedding
gaily
but
you
a
silly
fellow
now
why
did
you
come
and
ask
me
to
find
you
a
wife
why
i
know
two
or
three
girls
of
really
good
family
who
would
have
jumped
simply
jumped
at
a
man
with
your
money
pretty
girls
too
but
you
always
were
so
horribly
unpractical
do
you
know
my
dear
boy
that
there
are
heaps
of
ladies
real
ladies
waiting
the
first
decent
man
who
offers
them
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
why
have
you
used
the
opportunities
that
you
knew
i
could
put
in
your
way
widdowson
rose
from
his
seat
and
stood
stiffly
see
you
do
understand
me
in
the
least
i
am
going
to
marry
because
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
met
the
woman
whom
i
can
respect
and
love
very
nice
and
proper
but
why
should
you
respect
and
love
a
girl
who
belongs
to
good
society
madden
is
a
lady
he
replied
indignantly
yes
to
be
sure
hummed
the
other
letting
her
head
roll
back
bring
her
here
some
day
when
we
can
lunch
quietly
together
i
see
it
no
use
you
not
a
sharp
man
edmund
you
seriously
tell
me
asked
widdowson
with
grave
curiosity
there
are
ladies
in
good
society
who
would
have
married
me
just
because
i
have
a
few
hundreds
a
year
dear
boy
i
would
get
together
a
round
dozen
in
two
or
three
days
girls
who
would
make
good
faithful
wives
in
mere
gratitude
to
the
man
who
saved
them
from
horrors
me
if
i
say
that
i
do
believe
it
luke
laughed
merrily
and
the
conversation
went
on
in
this
strain
for
another
ten
minutes
at
the
end
luke
made
herself
very
agreeable
praised
monica
for
her
sweet
face
and
gentle
manners
and
so
dismissed
the
solemn
man
with
a
renewed
promise
to
countenance
the
marriage
by
her
gracious
presence
when
rhoda
nunn
returned
from
her
holiday
it
wanted
but
a
week
to
monica
wedding
so
speedily
had
everything
been
determined
and
arranged
miss
barfoot
having
learnt
from
virginia
all
that
was
to
be
known
concerning
widdowson
felt
able
to
hope
for
the
best
a
grave
husband
of
mature
years
and
with
means
more
than
sufficient
seemed
to
the
eye
of
experience
no
unsuitable
match
for
a
girl
such
as
monica
this
view
of
the
situation
caused
rhoda
to
smile
with
contemptuous
tolerance
yet
she
remarked
have
heard
you
speak
severely
of
such
marriages
is
the
ideal
wedlock
replied
miss
barfoot
so
much
in
life
is
compromise
after
all
she
may
regard
him
more
affectionally
than
we
imagine
doubt
she
has
weighed
advantages
if
the
prospects
you
offered
her
had
proved
more
to
her
taste
she
would
have
dismissed
this
elderly
admirer
his
fate
has
been
decided
during
the
last
few
weeks
probable
that
the
invitation
to
your
wednesday
evenings
gave
her
a
hope
of
meeting
young
men
see
no
harm
if
it
did
said
miss
barfoot
smiling
miss
vesper
would
very
soon
undeceive
her
on
that
point
hardly
thought
of
her
as
a
girl
likely
to
make
chance
friendships
with
men
in
highways
and
more
did
i
and
that
makes
all
the
more
content
with
what
has
come
about
she
ran
a
terrible
risk
poor
child
you
see
rhoda
nature
is
too
strong
for
us
rhoda
threw
her
head
back
the
delight
of
her
sister
it
is
really
pathetic
the
mere
fact
that
monica
is
to
be
married
blinds
the
poor
woman
to
every
possibility
of
misfortune
in
the
course
of
the
same
conversation
rhoda
remarked
thoughtfully
strikes
me
that
widdowson
must
be
of
a
confiding
nature
i
do
think
men
in
general
at
all
events
those
with
money
care
to
propose
marriage
to
girls
they
encounter
by
the
way
suppose
he
saw
that
the
case
was
exceptional
was
he
to
see
that
are
severe
her
shop
training
accounts
for
much
the
elder
sisters
could
never
have
found
a
husband
in
this
way
the
revelation
must
have
shocked
them
at
first
rhoda
dismissed
the
subject
lightly
and
henceforth
showed
only
the
faintest
interest
in
monica
concerns
monica
meanwhile
rejoiced
in
her
liberation
from
the
work
and
philosophic
severities
of
great
portland
street
she
saw
widdowson
somewhere
or
other
every
day
and
heard
him
discourse
on
the
life
that
was
before
them
herself
for
the
most
part
keeping
silence
together
they
called
upon
luke
and
had
luncheon
with
her
monica
was
not
displeased
with
her
reception
and
began
secretly
to
hope
that
more
than
a
glimpse
of
that
gorgeous
world
might
some
day
be
vouchsafed
to
her
apart
from
her
future
husband
monica
was
in
a
sportive
mood
with
occasional
fits
of
exhilaration
which
seemed
rather
unnatural
she
had
declared
to
mildred
her
intention
of
inviting
miss
nunn
to
the
wedding
and
her
mind
was
evidently
set
on
carrying
out
this
joke
as
she
regarded
it
when
the
desire
was
intimated
by
letter
rhoda
replied
with
a
civil
refusal
she
would
be
altogether
out
of
place
at
such
a
ceremony
but
hoped
that
monica
would
accept
her
heartiest
good
wishes
virginia
was
then
dispatched
to
queen
road
and
appealed
so
movingly
that
the
prophetess
at
length
yielded
on
hearing
this
monica
danced
with
delight
and
her
companion
in
rutland
street
could
not
help
sharing
her
merriment
the
ceremony
was
performed
at
a
church
at
herne
hill
by
an
odd
arrangement
like
everything
else
in
the
story
of
this
pair
a
result
of
social
and
personal
embarrassments
monica
belongings
including
her
apparel
for
the
day
were
previously
dispatched
to
the
house
whither
in
company
with
virginia
the
bride
went
early
in
the
morning
it
was
one
of
the
quietest
of
weddings
but
all
ordinary
formalities
were
complied
with
widdowson
having
no
independent
views
on
the
subject
present
were
virginia
to
give
away
the
bride
miss
vesper
who
looked
decidedly
odd
in
a
pretty
dress
given
her
by
monica
rhoda
nunn
who
appeared
to
advantage
in
a
costume
of
quite
unexpected
appropriateness
widdowson
an
imposing
figure
evidently
feeling
that
she
had
got
into
strange
society
and
as
friend
of
the
bridegroom
one
newdick
a
musty
and
nervous
city
clerk
depression
was
manifest
on
every
countenance
not
excepting
widdowson
the
man
had
such
a
stern
gloomy
look
and
held
himself
with
so
much
awkwardness
that
he
might
have
been
imagined
to
stand
here
on
compulsion
for
an
hour
before
going
to
the
church
monica
cried
and
seemed
unutterably
doleful
she
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
her
face
was
ghastly
virginia
gladness
gave
way
just
before
the
company
assembled
and
she
too
shed
many
tears
there
was
a
breakfast
more
dismal
fooling
than
even
this
species
of
fooling
is
wont
to
be
newdick
trembling
and
bloodless
proposed
monica
health
widdowson
stern
and
dark
as
ever
gloomily
responded
and
then
was
happily
over
by
one
the
gathering
began
to
disperse
monica
drew
rhoda
nunn
aside
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
she
whispered
with
half
a
sob
all
seems
very
silly
and
i
sure
you
have
wished
yourself
away
a
hundred
times
i
am
really
seriously
grateful
to
you
rhoda
put
a
hand
on
each
side
of
the
girl
face
and
kissed
her
but
without
saying
a
word
and
thereupon
left
the
house
mildred
vesper
after
changing
her
dress
in
the
room
used
by
monica
as
she
had
done
on
arriving
went
off
by
train
to
her
duties
in
great
portland
street
virginia
alone
remained
to
see
the
married
couple
start
for
their
honeymoon
they
were
going
into
cornwall
and
on
the
return
journey
would
manage
to
see
miss
madden
at
her
somerset
retreat
for
the
present
virginia
was
to
live
on
at
conisbee
but
not
in
the
old
way
henceforth
she
would
have
proper
attendance
and
modify
her
vegetarian
diet
at
the
express
bidding
of
the
doctor
as
she
explained
to
her
landlady
though
that
very
evening
everard
barfoot
made
a
call
upon
his
friends
in
chelsea
the
first
since
rhoda
return
from
cheddar
he
heard
nothing
of
the
event
that
marked
the
day
but
miss
nunn
appeared
to
him
unlike
herself
she
was
absent
had
little
to
say
and
looked
what
he
had
never
yet
known
her
oppressed
by
low
spirits
for
some
reason
or
other
miss
barfoot
left
the
room
are
thinking
with
regret
of
your
old
home
everard
remarked
taking
a
seat
nearer
to
miss
nunn
why
should
you
fancy
that
because
you
seem
rather
sad
is
sometimes
like
to
see
you
with
that
look
may
i
remind
you
that
you
promised
me
some
flowers
from
cheddar
so
i
did
exclaimed
the
other
in
a
tone
of
natural
recollection
have
brought
them
scientifically
pressed
between
i
fetch
them
when
she
returned
it
was
together
with
miss
barfoot
and
the
conversation
became
livelier
a
day
or
two
after
this
everard
left
town
and
was
away
for
three
weeks
part
of
the
time
in
ireland
left
london
for
a
while
he
wrote
from
killarney
to
his
cousin
because
i
was
afraid
i
had
begun
to
bore
you
and
miss
nunn
do
you
regret
giving
me
permission
to
call
upon
you
the
fact
is
i
ca
live
without
intelligent
female
society
talking
with
women
as
i
talk
with
you
two
is
one
of
my
chief
enjoyments
i
hope
you
wo
get
tired
of
my
visits
in
fact
they
are
all
but
a
necessity
to
me
as
i
have
discovered
since
coming
away
but
it
was
fair
that
you
should
have
a
rest
be
afraid
miss
barfoot
replied
to
this
part
of
his
letter
are
not
at
all
weary
of
your
conversation
the
truth
is
i
like
it
much
better
than
in
the
old
days
you
seem
to
me
to
have
a
healthier
mind
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
society
of
intelligent
women
we
affect
no
foolish
miss
nunn
and
i
is
a
good
thing
for
you
come
back
to
us
as
soon
as
you
like
i
shall
welcome
you
it
happened
that
his
return
to
england
was
almost
simultaneous
with
the
arrival
from
madeira
of
and
thomas
barfoot
everard
at
once
went
to
see
his
brother
who
for
the
present
was
staying
at
torquay
dictated
his
choice
of
residence
thomas
was
still
suffering
from
the
results
of
his
accident
his
wife
had
left
him
at
a
hotel
and
was
visiting
relatives
in
different
parts
of
england
the
brothers
exhibited
much
affectionate
feeling
after
their
long
separation
they
spent
a
week
together
and
planned
for
another
meeting
when
thomas
should
have
returned
to
her
husband
an
engagement
called
everard
back
to
town
he
was
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
of
his
friend
micklethwaite
now
actually
on
the
point
of
taking
place
the
mathematician
had
found
a
suitable
house
very
small
and
of
very
low
rental
out
at
south
tottenham
and
thither
was
transferred
the
furniture
which
had
been
in
his
bride
possession
since
the
death
of
her
parents
micklethwaite
bought
only
a
few
new
things
by
discreet
inquiry
barfoot
had
discovered
that
though
musically
inclined
would
not
possess
a
piano
her
old
instrument
being
quite
worn
out
and
not
worth
the
cost
of
conveyance
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
a
day
or
two
before
the
wedding
micklethwaite
was
astonished
by
the
arrival
of
an
instrument
of
the
cottage
species
mysteriously
addressed
to
a
person
not
yet
in
existence
micklethwaite
scoundrel
he
cried
when
on
the
next
day
barfoot
presented
himself
at
the
house
is
doing
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
a
man
who
complains
of
poverty
well
it
the
greatest
kindness
i
ever
received
that
all
fanny
will
be
devoted
to
you
with
music
in
the
house
our
blind
sister
will
lead
quite
a
different
life
confound
it
i
want
to
begin
crying
why
man
i
not
accustomed
to
receive
presents
even
as
a
proxy
i
have
had
one
since
i
was
a
schoolboy
an
audacious
statement
when
you
told
me
that
miss
wheatley
never
allowed
your
birthday
to
pass
without
sending
something
fanny
but
i
have
never
thought
of
fanny
as
a
separate
person
upon
my
word
now
i
think
of
it
i
never
have
fanny
and
i
have
been
one
for
ages
that
evening
the
sisters
arrived
from
their
country
home
micklethwaite
gave
up
the
house
to
them
and
went
to
a
lodging
it
was
with
no
little
curiosity
that
on
the
appointed
morning
barfoot
repaired
to
south
tottenham
he
had
seen
a
photograph
of
miss
wheatley
but
it
dated
from
seventeen
years
ago
standing
in
her
presence
he
was
moved
with
compassion
and
with
another
feeling
more
rarely
excited
in
him
by
a
woman
face
that
of
reverential
tenderness
impossible
to
recognize
in
this
countenance
the
features
known
to
him
from
the
portrait
at
she
had
possessed
a
sweet
simple
comeliness
on
which
any
man
eye
would
have
rested
with
pleasure
at
forty
she
was
wrinkled
sallow
indelible
weariness
stamped
upon
her
brow
and
lips
she
looked
much
older
than
mary
barfoot
though
they
were
just
of
an
age
and
all
this
for
want
of
a
little
money
the
life
of
a
pure
gentle
woman
worn
away
in
hopeless
longing
and
in
hard
struggle
for
daily
bread
as
she
took
his
hand
and
thanked
him
with
an
exquisite
modesty
for
the
present
she
had
received
everard
felt
a
lump
rise
in
his
throat
he
was
ashamed
to
notice
that
the
years
had
dealt
so
unkindly
with
her
fixing
his
look
upon
her
eyes
he
gladdened
at
the
gladness
which
shone
in
them
at
the
soft
light
which
they
could
still
shed
forth
micklethwaite
was
probably
unconscious
of
the
poor
woman
faded
appearance
he
had
seen
her
from
time
to
time
and
always
with
the
love
which
idealizes
in
his
own
pathetic
phrase
she
was
simply
a
part
of
himself
he
no
more
thought
of
criticizing
her
features
than
of
standing
before
the
glass
to
mark
and
comment
upon
his
own
it
was
enough
to
glance
at
him
as
he
took
his
place
beside
her
the
proudest
and
happiest
of
men
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
for
him
kind
fate
in
giving
her
to
his
arms
had
blotted
out
those
long
years
of
sorrow
and
fanny
was
the
betrothed
of
his
youth
beautiful
in
his
sight
as
when
first
he
looked
upon
her
her
sister
younger
by
five
years
had
more
regular
lineaments
but
she
too
was
worn
with
suffering
and
her
sightless
eyes
made
it
more
distressing
to
contemplate
her
she
spoke
cheerfully
however
and
laughed
with
joy
in
fanny
happiness
barfoot
pressed
both
her
hands
with
the
friendliest
warmth
one
vehicle
conveyed
them
all
to
the
church
and
in
half
an
hour
the
lady
to
whom
the
piano
was
addressed
had
come
into
being
the
simplest
of
transformations
no
bridal
gown
no
veil
no
wreath
only
the
gold
ring
for
symbol
of
union
and
it
might
have
happened
nigh
a
score
of
years
ago
nigh
a
score
of
years
lost
from
the
span
of
human
life
all
for
want
of
a
little
money
will
say
to
you
here
muttered
everard
to
his
friend
at
the
church
door
the
married
man
gripped
him
by
the
arm
will
do
nothing
of
the
fanny
he
wants
to
be
off
at
once
you
wo
go
until
you
have
heard
my
wife
play
something
on
that
blessed
instrument
so
all
entered
a
cab
again
and
drove
back
to
the
house
a
servant
who
had
come
with
fanny
from
the
country
a
girl
of
fifteen
opened
the
door
to
them
smiling
and
curtseying
and
all
sat
together
in
happy
talk
the
blind
woman
gayest
among
them
she
wished
to
have
the
clergyman
described
to
her
and
the
appearance
of
the
church
then
micklethwaite
placed
herself
at
the
piano
and
played
simple
music
neither
well
nor
badly
but
to
the
infinite
delight
of
two
of
her
hearers
barfoot
said
the
sister
at
length
have
known
your
name
for
a
long
time
but
i
little
thought
to
meet
you
on
such
a
day
as
this
and
to
owe
you
such
endless
thanks
so
long
as
i
can
have
music
i
forget
that
i
ca
see
is
the
finest
fellow
on
earth
exclaimed
micklethwaite
least
he
would
be
if
he
understood
trilinear
strong
in
mathematics
mrs
micklethwaite
asked
everard
oh
dear
no
i
never
got
much
past
the
rule
of
three
but
tom
has
forgiven
me
that
long
ago
do
despair
of
getting
you
into
plane
trigonometry
fanny
we
will
gossip
about
sines
and
before
we
die
it
was
said
and
everard
could
not
but
burst
into
laughter
he
sat
down
with
them
to
their
plain
midday
meal
and
early
in
the
afternoon
took
his
leave
he
had
no
inclination
to
go
home
if
the
empty
flat
could
be
dignified
with
such
a
name
after
reading
the
papers
at
his
club
he
walked
aimlessly
about
the
streets
until
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
same
place
for
dinner
then
he
sat
with
a
cigar
dreaming
and
at
eight
went
to
the
royal
oak
station
and
journeyed
to
chelsea
chapter
xiii
discord
of
leaders
a
disappointment
awaited
him
miss
barfoot
was
not
well
enough
to
see
any
one
had
she
been
suffering
long
he
inquired
no
it
was
only
this
evening
she
had
not
dined
and
was
gone
to
her
room
miss
nunn
could
not
receive
him
he
went
home
and
wrote
to
his
cousin
the
next
morning
he
came
upon
a
passage
in
the
newspaper
which
seemed
to
suggest
a
cause
for
miss
barfoot
indisposition
it
was
the
report
of
an
inquest
a
girl
named
bella
royston
had
poisoned
herself
she
was
living
alone
without
occupation
and
received
visits
only
from
one
lady
this
lady
her
name
miss
barfoot
had
been
supplying
her
with
money
and
had
just
found
her
a
situation
in
a
house
of
business
but
the
girl
appeared
to
have
gone
through
troubles
which
had
so
disturbed
her
mind
that
she
could
not
make
the
effort
required
of
her
she
left
a
few
lines
addressed
to
her
benefactress
just
saying
that
she
chose
death
rather
than
the
struggle
to
recover
her
position
it
was
saturday
he
decided
to
call
in
the
afternoon
and
see
whether
mary
had
recovered
again
a
disappointment
miss
barfoot
was
better
and
had
been
away
since
breakfast
miss
nunn
was
also
absent
everard
sauntered
about
the
neighbourhood
and
presently
found
himself
in
the
gardens
of
chelsea
hospital
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
and
so
still
that
he
heard
the
fall
of
yellow
leaves
as
he
walked
hither
and
thither
along
the
alleys
his
failure
to
obtain
an
interview
with
miss
nunn
annoyed
him
but
for
her
presence
in
the
house
he
would
not
have
got
into
this
habit
of
going
there
as
far
as
ever
from
harbouring
any
serious
thoughts
concerning
rhoda
he
felt
himself
impelled
along
the
way
which
he
had
jokingly
indicated
in
talk
with
micklethwaite
he
was
tempted
to
make
love
to
her
as
an
interesting
pastime
to
observe
how
so
a
woman
would
conduct
herself
under
such
circumstances
had
she
or
not
a
vein
of
sentiment
in
her
character
was
it
impossible
to
move
her
as
other
women
are
moved
meditating
thus
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
she
was
seated
a
few
yards
away
and
seemingly
had
not
yet
become
aware
of
him
her
eyes
were
on
the
ground
and
troubled
reverie
appeared
in
her
countenance
have
just
called
at
the
house
miss
nunn
how
is
my
cousin
she
had
looked
up
only
a
moment
before
he
spoke
and
seemed
vexed
at
being
thus
discovered
believe
miss
barfoot
is
quite
well
she
answered
coldly
as
they
shook
hands
yesterday
she
was
not
so
headache
or
something
of
the
kind
he
was
astonished
rhoda
spoke
with
a
cold
indifference
she
had
risen
and
showed
her
wish
to
move
from
the
spot
had
to
attend
an
inquest
yesterday
perhaps
it
rather
upset
her
i
think
it
did
unable
to
adapt
himself
at
once
to
this
singular
mood
of
rhoda
but
resolved
not
to
let
her
go
before
he
had
tried
to
learn
the
cause
of
it
he
walked
along
by
her
side
in
this
part
of
the
gardens
there
were
only
a
few
nursemaids
and
children
it
would
have
been
a
capital
place
and
time
for
improving
his
intimacy
with
the
remarkable
woman
but
possibly
she
was
determined
to
be
rid
of
him
a
contest
between
his
will
and
hers
would
be
an
amusement
decidedly
to
his
taste
also
have
been
disturbed
by
it
miss
nunn
the
inquest
she
returned
with
barely
veiled
scorn
i
have
not
you
know
that
poor
girl
time
ago
it
is
only
natural
that
her
miserable
fate
should
sadden
you
he
spoke
as
if
with
respectful
sympathy
ignoring
what
she
had
said
has
no
effect
whatever
upon
me
rhoda
answered
glancing
at
him
with
surprise
and
displeasure
me
if
i
say
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
perhaps
you
she
interrupted
him
do
easily
forgive
anyone
who
charges
me
with
falsehood
mr
barfoot
you
take
it
too
seriously
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
i
was
going
to
say
that
perhaps
you
wo
allow
yourself
to
acknowledge
any
feeling
of
compassion
in
such
a
case
do
acknowledge
what
i
do
feel
i
will
bid
you
he
smiled
at
her
with
all
the
softness
and
persuasiveness
of
which
he
was
capable
she
had
offered
her
hand
with
cold
dignity
and
instead
of
taking
it
merely
for
he
retained
it
must
you
shall
forgive
me
i
shall
be
too
miserable
if
you
dismiss
me
in
this
way
i
see
that
i
was
altogether
wrong
you
know
all
the
particulars
of
the
case
and
i
have
only
read
a
brief
newspaper
account
i
am
sure
the
girl
did
deserve
your
pity
she
was
trying
to
draw
her
hand
away
everard
felt
the
strength
of
her
muscles
and
the
sensation
was
somehow
so
pleasant
that
he
could
not
at
once
release
her
do
pardon
me
miss
nunn
do
be
foolish
i
will
thank
you
to
let
my
hand
go
was
it
possible
her
cheek
had
coloured
ever
so
slightly
but
with
indignation
no
doubt
for
her
eyes
flashed
sternly
at
him
very
unwillingly
everard
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
the
command
you
have
the
kindness
to
tell
me
he
said
more
gravely
my
cousin
was
suffering
only
from
that
cause
ca
say
she
added
after
a
pause
have
spoken
with
miss
barfoot
for
two
or
three
days
he
looked
at
her
with
genuine
astonishment
have
seen
each
other
barfoot
is
angry
with
me
i
think
we
shall
be
obliged
to
part
part
what
can
possibly
have
happened
miss
barfoot
angry
with
i
satisfy
your
curiosity
barfoot
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
that
the
subject
of
our
difference
is
the
girl
you
mentioned
not
very
long
ago
she
tried
to
persuade
your
cousin
to
receive
her
again
to
give
her
lessons
at
the
place
in
great
portland
street
as
before
she
disgraced
herself
miss
barfoot
with
too
ready
was
willing
to
do
this
but
i
resisted
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
very
weak
and
wrong
thing
to
do
at
the
time
she
ended
by
agreeing
with
me
now
that
the
girl
has
killed
herself
she
throws
the
blame
upon
my
interference
we
had
a
painful
conversation
and
i
do
think
we
can
continue
to
live
together
barfoot
listened
with
gratification
it
was
much
to
have
compelled
rhoda
to
explain
herself
and
on
such
a
subject
even
to
work
together
he
asked
is
doubtful
rhoda
still
moved
forward
but
very
slowly
and
without
impatience
will
somehow
get
over
this
difficulty
i
am
sure
such
friends
as
you
and
mary
do
quarrel
like
ordinary
unreasonable
women
wo
you
let
me
be
of
use
asked
rhoda
with
surprise
shall
make
my
cousin
see
that
she
is
wrong
do
you
know
that
she
is
wrong
i
am
convinced
that
must
be
right
i
respect
judgment
but
i
respect
yours
still
more
rhoda
raised
her
head
and
smiled
compliment
she
said
me
less
than
the
one
you
have
uttered
without
intending
it
must
explain
said
that
by
making
miss
barfoot
see
she
was
wrong
you
could
alter
her
mind
towards
me
the
world
opinion
would
hardly
support
you
in
that
even
in
the
case
of
men
everard
laughed
this
is
better
now
we
are
talking
in
the
old
way
surely
you
know
that
the
world
opinion
has
no
validity
for
me
she
kept
silence
after
all
mary
wrong
i
not
afraid
to
ask
the
question
now
that
your
face
has
cleared
a
little
how
angry
you
were
with
me
but
surely
i
did
deserve
it
you
would
have
been
much
more
forbearing
if
you
had
known
what
delight
i
felt
when
i
saw
you
sitting
over
there
it
is
nearly
a
month
since
we
met
and
i
could
keep
away
any
longer
rhoda
swept
the
distance
with
indifferent
eyes
was
fond
of
this
girl
he
inquired
watching
her
she
was
her
distress
and
even
anger
are
natural
enough
we
discuss
the
girl
history
probably
i
know
all
that
i
need
to
but
whatever
her
misdoing
you
certainly
did
wish
to
drive
her
to
suicide
rhoda
deigned
no
reply
the
same
he
continued
in
his
gentlest
tone
turns
out
that
you
have
practically
done
so
if
mary
had
taken
the
girl
back
that
despair
would
most
likely
never
have
come
upon
her
is
it
natural
that
mary
should
repent
of
having
been
guided
by
you
and
perhaps
say
rather
severe
things
no
doubt
but
it
is
just
as
natural
for
me
to
resent
blame
where
i
have
done
nothing
blameworthy
are
absolutely
sure
that
this
is
the
case
thought
you
expressed
a
conviction
that
i
was
in
the
right
there
was
no
smile
but
everard
believed
that
he
detected
its
possibility
on
the
closed
lips
have
got
into
the
way
of
always
thinking
so
in
questions
of
this
kind
but
perhaps
you
tend
to
err
on
the
side
of
severity
perhaps
you
make
too
little
allowance
for
human
weakness
weakness
is
a
plea
that
has
been
much
abused
and
generally
in
an
interested
spirit
this
was
something
like
a
personal
rebuke
whether
she
so
meant
it
barfoot
could
not
determine
he
hoped
she
did
for
the
more
personal
their
talk
became
the
better
he
would
be
pleased
for
one
he
said
seldom
urge
that
plea
whether
in
my
own
defence
or
another
but
it
answers
to
a
spirit
we
ca
altogether
dispense
with
do
you
feel
ever
so
little
regret
that
your
severe
logic
prevailed
the
slightest
regret
everard
thought
this
answer
magnificent
he
had
anticipated
some
evasion
however
inappropriately
he
was
constrained
to
smile
i
admire
your
consistency
we
others
are
poor
halting
creatures
in
comparison
barfoot
said
rhoda
suddenly
have
had
enough
of
this
if
your
approval
is
sincere
i
do
ask
for
it
if
you
are
practising
your
powers
of
irony
i
had
rather
you
chose
some
other
person
i
will
go
my
way
if
you
please
she
just
bent
her
head
and
left
him
enough
for
the
present
having
raised
his
hat
and
turned
on
his
heels
barfoot
strolled
away
in
a
mood
of
peculiar
satisfaction
he
laughed
to
himself
she
was
certainly
a
fine
creature
yes
physically
as
well
her
appearance
on
the
whole
pleased
him
she
could
dress
very
plainly
without
disguising
the
advantages
of
figure
she
possessed
he
pictured
her
rambling
about
the
hills
and
longed
to
be
her
companion
on
such
an
expedition
there
would
be
no
consulting
with
feebleness
as
when
one
sets
forth
to
walk
with
the
everyday
woman
what
daring
topics
might
come
up
in
the
course
of
a
stretch
across
country
no
grundyism
in
rhoda
nunn
no
simpering
no
mincing
of
phrases
why
a
man
might
do
worse
than
secure
her
for
his
comrade
through
the
whole
journey
of
life
suppose
he
pushed
his
joke
to
the
very
point
of
asking
her
to
marry
him
undoubtedly
she
would
refuse
but
how
enjoyable
to
watch
the
proud
vigour
of
her
freedom
asserting
itself
yet
would
not
an
offer
of
marriage
be
too
commonplace
rather
propose
to
her
to
share
his
life
in
a
free
union
without
sanction
of
forms
which
neither
for
her
nor
him
were
sanction
at
all
was
it
too
bold
a
thought
not
if
he
really
meant
it
uttered
insincerely
such
words
would
be
insult
she
would
see
through
his
pretence
of
earnestness
and
then
farewell
to
her
for
ever
but
if
his
intellectual
sympathy
became
tinged
with
passion
and
did
he
discern
no
possibility
of
that
an
odd
thing
were
he
to
fall
in
love
with
rhoda
nunn
hitherto
his
ideal
had
been
a
widely
different
type
of
woman
he
had
demanded
rare
beauty
of
face
and
the
charm
of
a
refined
voluptuousness
to
be
sure
it
was
but
an
ideal
no
woman
that
approached
it
had
ever
come
within
his
sphere
the
dream
exercised
less
power
over
him
than
a
few
years
ago
perhaps
because
his
youth
was
behind
him
rhoda
might
well
represent
the
desire
of
a
mature
man
strengthened
by
modern
culture
and
with
his
senses
fairly
subordinate
to
reason
heaven
forbid
that
he
should
ever
tie
himself
to
the
tame
domestic
female
and
just
as
little
could
he
seek
for
a
mate
among
the
women
of
society
the
creatures
all
surface
with
empty
pates
and
vitiated
blood
no
marriage
for
him
in
the
common
understanding
of
the
word
he
wanted
neither
offspring
nor
a
rhoda
nunn
if
she
thought
of
such
things
at
all
probably
desired
a
union
which
would
permit
her
to
remain
an
intellectual
being
the
kitchen
the
cradle
and
the
had
no
power
over
her
imagination
as
likely
as
not
however
she
was
perfectly
content
with
single
life
even
regarded
it
as
essential
to
her
purposes
in
her
face
he
read
chastity
her
eye
avoided
no
scrutiny
her
palm
was
cold
one
does
not
break
the
heart
of
such
a
woman
heartbreak
is
a
very
disorder
associated
with
poverty
of
brain
if
rhoda
were
what
he
thought
her
she
enjoyed
this
opportunity
of
studying
a
modern
male
and
cared
not
how
far
he
proceeded
in
his
own
investigations
sure
that
at
any
moment
she
could
bid
him
fall
back
the
amusement
was
only
just
beginning
and
if
for
him
it
became
earnest
why
what
did
he
seek
but
strong
experiences
rhoda
in
the
meantime
had
gone
home
she
shut
herself
in
her
bedroom
and
remained
there
until
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
miss
barfoot
entered
the
just
before
her
they
sat
down
in
silence
and
through
the
meal
exchanged
but
a
few
sentences
relative
to
a
topic
of
the
hour
which
interested
neither
of
them
the
elder
woman
had
a
very
unhappy
countenance
she
looked
worn
out
her
eyes
never
lifted
themselves
from
the
table
dinner
over
miss
barfoot
went
to
the
alone
she
had
sat
there
about
half
an
hour
brooding
unoccupied
when
rhoda
came
in
and
stood
before
her
have
been
thinking
it
over
it
is
right
for
me
to
remain
here
such
an
arrangement
was
only
possible
whilst
we
were
on
terms
of
perfect
understanding
must
do
what
you
think
best
rhoda
the
other
replied
gravely
but
with
no
accent
of
displeasure
i
had
better
take
a
lodging
somewhere
what
i
wish
to
know
is
whether
you
can
still
employ
me
with
any
satisfaction
do
employ
you
that
is
not
the
word
to
describe
your
relations
with
me
if
we
must
use
business
language
you
are
simply
my
partner
your
kindness
put
me
into
that
position
when
you
no
longer
regard
me
as
a
friend
i
am
only
in
your
employment
have
ceased
to
regard
you
as
a
friend
the
estrangement
between
us
is
entirely
of
your
making
seeing
that
rhoda
would
not
sit
down
miss
barfoot
rose
and
stood
by
the
fireplace
ca
bear
reproaches
said
the
former
of
all
when
they
are
irrational
and
undeserved
i
reproached
you
it
was
in
a
tone
which
should
never
have
given
you
offence
one
would
think
that
i
had
rated
you
like
a
disobedient
servant
had
been
possible
answered
rhoda
with
a
faint
smile
should
never
have
been
here
you
said
that
you
bitterly
repented
having
given
way
to
me
on
a
certain
occasion
that
was
unreasonable
in
giving
way
you
declared
yourself
convinced
and
the
reproach
i
certainly
did
deserve
for
i
had
behaved
conscientiously
it
allowed
me
to
disapprove
of
what
your
conscience
dictates
when
you
have
taken
the
same
view
and
acted
upon
it
i
do
lay
claim
to
many
virtues
and
i
have
that
of
meekness
i
could
never
endure
anger
my
nature
resents
it
did
wrong
to
speak
angrily
but
indeed
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
saying
i
had
suffered
a
terrible
shock
i
loved
that
poor
girl
i
loved
her
all
the
more
for
what
i
had
seen
of
her
since
she
came
to
implore
my
help
your
utter
coldness
it
seemed
to
me
inhuman
i
shrank
from
you
if
your
face
had
shown
ever
so
little
compassion
no
compassion
you
have
hardened
your
heart
with
theory
guard
yourself
rhoda
to
work
for
women
one
must
keep
one
womanhood
you
are
becoming
you
are
wandering
as
far
from
the
true
way
oh
much
further
than
bella
did
ca
answer
you
when
we
argued
about
our
differences
in
a
friendly
spirit
all
was
permissible
now
if
i
spoke
my
thought
it
would
be
mere
harshness
and
cause
of
embitterment
i
fear
all
is
at
an
end
between
us
i
should
perpetually
remind
you
of
this
sorrow
there
was
a
silence
of
some
length
rhoda
turned
away
and
stood
in
reflection
us
do
nothing
hastily
said
miss
barfoot
have
more
to
think
of
than
our
own
feelings
have
said
that
i
am
quite
willing
to
go
on
with
my
work
but
it
must
be
on
a
different
footing
the
relation
between
us
can
no
longer
be
that
of
equals
i
am
content
to
follow
your
directions
but
your
dislike
of
me
will
make
this
impossible
you
misunderstand
me
wretchedly
i
think
rather
it
is
you
who
dislike
me
as
a
weak
woman
with
no
command
of
her
emotions
again
they
ceased
from
speech
presently
miss
barfoot
stepped
forward
i
shall
be
away
all
i
may
not
return
to
london
until
monday
morning
will
you
think
quietly
over
it
all
believe
me
i
am
not
angry
with
you
and
as
for
disliking
you
what
nonsense
are
we
talking
but
i
ca
regret
that
i
let
you
see
how
painfully
your
behaviour
impressed
me
that
hardness
is
not
natural
to
you
you
have
encouraged
yourself
in
it
and
you
are
warping
a
very
noble
character
wish
only
to
be
honest
where
you
felt
compassion
i
felt
indignation
we
have
gone
through
all
that
the
indignation
was
a
forced
exaggerated
sentiment
you
ca
see
it
in
that
light
perhaps
but
try
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
bella
had
been
your
sister
is
confusing
the
point
at
issue
rhoda
exclaimed
irritably
i
ever
denied
the
force
of
such
feelings
my
grief
would
have
blinded
me
to
all
larger
considerations
of
course
but
she
was
happily
my
sister
and
i
remained
free
to
speak
the
simple
truth
about
her
case
it
is
personal
feeling
that
directs
a
great
movement
in
civilization
if
you
were
right
i
also
was
right
you
should
have
recognized
the
inevitable
discord
of
our
opinions
at
that
moment
did
seem
to
me
inevitable
should
have
despised
myself
if
i
could
have
affected
sympathy
yes
have
really
felt
it
that
would
have
meant
that
i
did
not
know
myself
i
should
never
again
have
dared
to
speak
on
any
grave
subject
miss
barfoot
smiled
sadly
young
you
are
oh
there
is
far
more
than
ten
years
between
our
ages
rhoda
in
spirit
you
are
a
young
girl
and
i
an
old
woman
no
no
we
quarrel
your
companionship
is
far
too
precious
to
me
and
i
dare
to
think
that
mine
is
not
without
value
for
you
wait
till
my
grief
has
had
its
course
then
i
shall
be
more
reasonable
and
do
you
more
justice
rhoda
turned
towards
the
door
lingered
but
without
looking
back
and
so
left
the
room
miss
barfoot
was
absent
as
she
had
announced
returning
only
in
time
for
her
duties
in
great
portland
street
on
monday
morning
she
and
rhoda
then
shook
hands
but
without
a
word
of
personal
reference
they
went
through
the
day
work
as
usual
this
was
the
day
of
the
month
on
which
miss
barfoot
would
deliver
her
four
address
the
subject
had
been
announced
a
week
ago
as
an
invader
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
work
was
put
aside
and
seats
were
rapidly
arranged
for
the
small
audience
it
numbered
only
thirteen
the
girls
already
on
the
premises
and
a
few
who
came
specially
all
were
aware
of
the
tragedy
in
which
miss
barfoot
had
recently
been
concerned
her
air
of
sadness
so
great
a
contrast
to
that
with
which
she
was
wont
to
address
them
they
naturally
attributed
to
this
cause
as
always
she
began
in
the
simplest
conversational
tone
not
long
since
she
had
received
an
anonymous
letter
written
by
some
clerk
out
of
employment
abusing
her
roundly
for
her
encouragement
of
female
competition
in
the
clerkly
world
the
taste
of
this
epistle
was
as
bad
as
its
grammar
but
they
should
hear
it
she
read
it
all
through
now
whoever
the
writer
might
be
it
seemed
pretty
clear
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
person
with
whom
one
could
profitably
argue
no
use
in
replying
to
him
even
had
he
given
the
opportunity
for
all
that
his
uncivil
attack
had
a
meaning
and
there
were
plenty
of
people
ready
to
urge
his
argument
in
more
respectable
terms
will
tell
you
that
in
entering
the
commercial
world
you
not
only
unsex
yourselves
but
do
a
grievous
wrong
to
the
numberless
men
struggling
hard
for
bare
sustenance
you
reduce
salaries
you
press
into
an
already
overcrowded
field
you
injure
even
your
own
sex
by
making
it
impossible
for
men
to
marry
who
if
they
earned
enough
would
be
supporting
a
wife
continued
miss
barfoot
it
was
not
her
purpose
to
debate
the
economic
aspects
of
the
question
she
would
consider
it
from
another
point
of
view
repeating
perhaps
much
that
she
had
already
said
to
them
on
other
occasions
but
doing
so
because
these
thoughts
had
just
now
very
strong
possession
of
her
mind
this
abusive
correspondent
who
declared
that
he
was
supplanted
by
a
young
woman
who
did
his
work
for
smaller
payment
doubtless
had
a
grievance
but
in
the
miserable
disorder
of
our
social
state
one
grievance
had
to
be
weighed
against
another
and
miss
barfoot
held
that
there
was
much
more
to
be
urged
on
behalf
of
women
who
invaded
what
had
been
exclusively
the
men
sphere
than
on
behalf
of
the
men
who
began
to
complain
of
this
invasion
point
to
half
a
dozen
occupations
which
are
deemed
strictly
suitable
for
women
why
do
we
confine
ourselves
to
this
ground
why
do
i
encourage
girls
to
become
governesses
hospital
nurses
and
so
on
you
think
i
ought
to
reply
that
already
there
are
too
many
applicants
for
such
places
it
would
be
true
but
i
do
care
to
make
use
of
the
argument
which
at
once
involves
us
in
a
debate
with
the
clerk
no
to
put
the
truth
in
a
few
words
i
am
not
chiefly
anxious
that
you
should
but
that
women
in
general
shall
become
and
responsible
human
me
carefully
a
governess
a
nurse
may
be
the
most
admirable
of
women
i
will
dissuade
no
one
from
following
those
careers
who
is
distinctly
fitted
for
them
but
these
are
only
a
few
out
of
the
vast
number
of
girls
who
must
if
they
are
not
to
be
despicable
persons
somehow
find
serious
work
because
i
myself
have
had
an
education
in
clerkship
and
have
most
capacity
for
such
employment
i
look
about
for
girls
of
like
mind
and
do
my
best
to
prepare
them
for
work
in
offices
and
here
i
must
become
emphatic
once
more
i
am
to
have
entered
on
this
course
i
am
that
i
can
show
girls
the
way
to
a
career
which
my
opponents
call
unwomanly
see
why
womanly
and
womanish
are
two
very
different
words
but
the
latter
as
the
world
uses
it
has
become
practically
synonymous
with
the
former
a
womanly
occupation
means
practically
an
occupation
that
a
man
disdains
and
here
is
the
root
of
the
matter
i
repeat
that
i
am
not
first
of
all
anxious
to
keep
you
supplied
with
daily
bread
i
am
a
troublesome
aggressive
revolutionary
person
i
want
to
do
away
with
that
common
confusion
of
the
words
womanly
and
womanish
and
i
see
very
clearly
that
this
can
only
be
effected
by
an
armed
movement
an
invasion
by
women
of
the
spheres
which
men
have
always
forbidden
us
to
enter
i
am
strenuously
opposed
to
that
view
of
us
set
forth
in
such
charming
language
by
ruskin
for
it
tells
on
the
side
of
those
men
who
think
and
speak
of
us
in
a
way
the
reverse
of
charming
were
we
living
in
an
ideal
world
i
think
women
would
not
go
to
sit
all
day
in
offices
but
the
fact
is
that
we
live
in
a
world
as
far
from
ideal
as
can
be
conceived
we
live
in
a
time
of
warfare
of
revolt
if
woman
is
no
longer
to
be
womanish
but
a
human
being
of
powers
and
responsibilities
she
must
become
militant
defiant
she
must
push
her
claims
to
the
extremity
excellent
governess
a
perfect
hospital
nurse
do
work
which
is
invaluable
but
for
our
cause
of
emancipation
they
are
no
good
nay
they
are
harmful
men
point
to
them
and
say
imitate
these
keep
to
your
proper
world
our
proper
world
is
the
world
of
intelligence
of
honest
effort
of
moral
strength
the
old
types
of
womanly
perfection
are
no
longer
helpful
to
us
like
the
church
service
which
to
all
but
one
person
in
a
thousand
has
become
meaningless
gabble
by
dint
of
repetition
these
types
have
lost
their
effect
they
are
no
longer
educational
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
what
course
of
training
will
wake
women
up
make
them
conscious
of
their
souls
startle
them
into
healthy
activity
must
be
something
new
something
free
from
the
reproach
of
womanliness
i
do
care
whether
we
crowd
out
the
men
or
not
i
care
results
if
only
women
are
made
strong
and
and
nobly
independent
the
world
must
look
to
its
concerns
most
likely
we
shall
have
a
revolution
in
the
social
order
greater
than
any
that
yet
seems
possible
let
it
come
and
let
us
help
its
coming
when
i
think
of
the
contemptible
wretchedness
of
women
enslaved
by
custom
by
their
weakness
by
their
desires
i
am
ready
to
cry
let
the
world
perish
in
tumult
rather
than
things
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
moment
her
voice
failed
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
the
hearers
most
of
them
understood
what
made
her
so
passionate
they
exchanged
grave
looks
abusive
correspondent
shall
do
as
best
he
can
he
suffers
for
the
folly
of
men
in
all
ages
we
ca
help
it
it
is
very
far
from
our
wish
to
cause
hardship
to
any
one
but
we
ourselves
are
escaping
from
a
hardship
that
has
become
intolerable
we
are
educating
ourselves
there
must
be
a
new
type
of
woman
active
in
every
sphere
of
life
a
new
worker
out
in
the
world
a
new
ruler
of
the
home
of
the
old
ideal
virtues
we
can
retain
many
but
we
have
to
add
to
them
those
which
have
been
thought
appropriate
only
in
men
let
a
woman
be
gentle
but
at
the
same
time
let
her
be
strong
let
her
be
pure
of
heart
but
none
the
less
wise
and
instructed
because
we
have
to
set
an
example
to
the
sleepy
of
our
sex
we
must
carry
on
an
active
warfare
must
be
invaders
whether
woman
is
the
equal
of
man
i
neither
know
nor
care
we
are
not
his
equal
in
size
in
weight
in
muscle
and
for
all
i
can
say
we
may
have
less
power
of
brain
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
enough
for
us
to
know
that
our
natural
growth
has
been
stunted
the
mass
of
women
have
always
been
paltry
creatures
and
their
paltriness
has
proved
a
curse
to
men
so
if
you
like
to
put
it
in
this
way
we
are
working
for
the
advantage
of
men
as
well
as
for
our
own
let
the
responsibility
for
disorder
rest
on
those
who
have
made
us
despise
our
old
selves
at
any
cost
at
any
cost
we
will
free
ourselves
from
the
heritage
of
weakness
and
contempt
the
assembly
was
longer
than
usual
in
dispersing
when
all
were
gone
miss
barfoot
listened
for
a
footstep
in
the
other
room
as
she
could
detect
no
sound
she
went
to
see
if
rhoda
was
there
or
not
yes
rhoda
was
sitting
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
she
looked
up
smiled
and
came
a
few
paces
forward
was
very
good
thought
it
would
please
you
miss
barfoot
drew
nearer
and
added
was
addressed
to
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
had
forgotten
how
i
really
thought
about
these
things
have
been
rhoda
replied
is
one
of
my
faults
is
their
eyes
met
believe
continued
rhoda
i
ought
to
ask
your
pardon
right
or
wrong
i
behaved
in
an
unmannerly
way
i
think
you
did
rhoda
smiled
bending
her
head
to
the
rebuke
there
the
last
of
it

barfoot

and
be
friends
chapter
xiv
motives
meeting
when
barfoot
made
his
next
evening
call
rhoda
did
not
appear
he
sat
for
some
time
in
pleasant
talk
with
his
cousin
no
reference
whatever
being
made
to
miss
nunn
then
at
length
beginning
to
fear
that
he
would
not
see
her
he
inquired
after
her
health
miss
nunn
was
very
well
answered
the
hostess
smiling
at
home
this
evening
with
some
kind
of
study
i
think
plainly
the
difference
between
these
women
had
come
to
a
happy
end
as
barfoot
foresaw
that
it
would
he
thought
it
better
to
make
no
mention
of
his
meeting
with
rhoda
in
the
gardens
was
a
very
unpleasant
affair
that
i
saw
your
name
connected
with
last
week
he
said
presently
made
me
very
miserable
ill
indeed
for
a
day
or
two
was
why
you
could
see
me
in
your
reply
to
my
note
you
made
no
mention
of
the
circumstances
miss
barfoot
kept
silence
frowning
slightly
she
looked
at
the
fire
near
which
they
were
both
sitting
for
the
weather
had
become
very
cold
doubt
pursued
everard
glancing
at
her
refrained
out
of
delicacy
on
my
account
i
mean
we
talk
of
it
a
moment
please
you
are
very
friendly
with
me
nowadays
but
i
suppose
your
estimate
of
my
character
remains
very
much
the
same
as
years
ago
is
the
use
of
such
questions
ask
for
a
distinct
purpose
you
ca
regard
me
with
any
respect
tell
you
the
truth
everard
i
know
nothing
about
you
i
have
no
wish
to
revive
disagreeable
memories
and
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
you
may
be
worthy
of
respect
far
so
good
now
in
justice
please
answer
me
another
question
how
have
you
spoken
of
me
to
miss
nunn
can
it
matter
matters
a
good
deal
have
you
told
her
any
scandal
about
me
i
have
everard
looked
at
her
with
surprise
spoke
to
miss
nunn
about
you
she
continued
i
thought
of
your
coming
here
frankly
i
used
you
as
an
illustration
of
the
evils
i
abominate
are
a
courageous
and
woman
cousin
mary
said
everard
laughing
a
little
you
have
found
some
other
example
there
was
no
reply
he
proceeded
nunn
regards
me
as
a
proved
scoundrel
never
told
her
the
story
i
made
known
the
general
grounds
of
my
dissatisfaction
with
you
that
was
all
that
something
i
glad
you
did
amuse
her
with
that
unedifying
bit
of
fiction
fiction
said
everard
bluntly
am
not
going
into
details
the
thing
over
and
done
with
and
i
chose
my
course
at
the
time
but
as
well
to
let
you
know
that
my
behaviour
was
grossly
misrepresented
in
using
me
to
point
a
moral
you
were
grievously
astray
i
shall
say
no
more
if
you
can
believe
me
do
if
you
ca
dismiss
the
matter
from
your
mind
there
followed
a
silence
of
some
moments
then
with
a
perfectly
calm
manner
miss
barfoot
began
to
speak
of
a
new
subject
everard
followed
her
lead
he
did
not
stay
much
longer
and
on
leaving
asked
to
be
remembered
to
miss
nunn
a
week
later
he
again
found
his
cousin
alone
he
now
felt
sure
that
miss
nunn
was
keeping
out
of
his
way
her
parting
from
him
in
the
gardens
had
been
decidedly
abrupt
and
possibly
it
signified
more
serious
offence
than
at
the
time
he
attributed
to
her
it
was
so
difficult
to
be
sure
of
anything
in
regard
to
miss
nunn
if
another
woman
had
acted
thus
he
would
have
judged
it
coquetry
but
perhaps
rhoda
was
quite
incapable
of
anything
of
that
kind
perhaps
she
took
herself
so
very
seriously
that
the
mere
suspicion
of
banter
in
his
talk
had
moved
her
to
grave
resentment
or
again
she
might
be
half
ashamed
to
meet
him
after
confessing
her
disagreement
with
miss
barfoot
on
recovery
from
unmistakable
it
was
she
had
seen
her
behaviour
in
an
embarrassing
light
between
these
various
conjectures
he
wavered
whilst
talking
with
mary
but
he
did
not
so
much
as
mention
miss
nunn
name
some
ten
days
went
by
and
he
paid
a
call
at
the
hour
sanctioned
by
society
five
in
the
afternoon
it
being
saturday
one
of
his
reasons
for
coming
at
this
time
was
the
hope
that
he
might
meet
other
callers
for
he
felt
curious
to
see
what
sort
of
people
visited
the
house
and
this
wish
was
gratified
on
entering
the
whither
he
was
led
by
the
servant
straightway
after
the
manner
of
the
world
he
found
not
only
his
cousin
and
her
friend
but
two
strangers
ladies
a
glance
informed
him
that
both
of
these
were
young
and
one
being
a
type
that
particularly
pleased
him
dark
pale
with
very
bright
eyes
miss
barfoot
received
him
as
any
hostess
would
have
done
she
was
her
cheerful
self
once
more
and
in
a
moment
introduced
him
to
the
lady
with
whom
she
had
been
talking
the
dark
one
by
name
widdowson
rhoda
nunn
sitting
apart
with
the
second
lady
gave
him
her
hand
but
at
once
resumed
her
conversation
with
widdowson
he
was
soon
chatting
in
his
easy
and
graceful
way
miss
barfoot
putting
in
a
word
now
and
then
he
saw
that
she
had
not
long
been
married
a
pleasant
diffidence
and
the
maidenly
glance
of
her
bright
eyes
indicated
this
she
was
dressed
very
prettily
and
seemed
aware
of
it
went
to
hear
the
new
opera
at
the
savoy
last
night
she
said
to
miss
barfoot
with
a
smile
of
remembered
enjoyment
you
miss
nunn
and
i
were
there
everard
gazed
at
his
cousin
with
humorous
incredulity
it
possible
he
exclaimed
were
at
the
savoy
is
the
impossibility
why
should
miss
nunn
and
i
go
to
the
theatre
appeal
to
widdowson
she
also
was
astonished
indeed
i
was
miss
barfoot
exclaimed
the
younger
lady
with
a
merry
little
laugh
hesitated
before
speaking
of
such
a
frivolous
entertainment
lowering
her
voice
and
casting
a
smile
in
rhoda
direction
miss
barfoot
replied
have
to
make
a
concession
occasionally
on
miss
nunn
account
it
would
be
unkind
never
to
allow
her
a
little
recreation
the
two
at
a
distance
were
talking
earnestly
with
grave
countenances
in
a
few
moments
they
rose
and
the
visitor
came
towards
miss
barfoot
to
take
her
leave
thereupon
everard
crossed
to
miss
nunn
there
anything
very
good
in
the
new
gilbert
and
sullivan
opera
he
asked
good
things
you
really
have
been
yet
i
ashamed
to
say
go
this
evening
if
you
can
get
a
seat
which
part
of
the
theatre
do
you
prefer
his
eye
rested
on
her
but
he
could
detect
no
irony
a
poor
man
you
know
i
have
to
be
content
with
the
cheap
places
which
do
you
like
best
the
savoy
operas
or
the
burlesques
at
the
gaiety
a
few
more
such
questions
and
answers
of
laboured
commonplace
or
strained
flippancy
and
everard
after
searching
his
companion
face
broke
off
with
a
laugh
now
he
said
have
talked
in
the
approved
five
way
precisely
the
dialogue
i
heard
in
a
yesterday
it
goes
on
day
after
day
year
after
year
through
the
whole
of
people
lives
are
on
friendly
terms
with
such
people
am
on
friendly
terms
with
people
of
every
kind
he
added
in
an
undertone
hope
i
may
include
you
miss
nunn
but
to
this
she
paid
no
attention
she
was
looking
at
monica
and
miss
barfoot
who
had
just
risen
from
their
seats
they
approached
and
presently
barfoot
found
himself
alone
with
the
familiar
pair
cup
of
tea
everard
asked
his
cousin
you
who
was
the
young
lady
you
did
introduce
me
to
haven
one
of
our
pupils
she
think
of
going
into
business
has
just
got
a
place
in
the
publishing
department
of
a
weekly
paper
really
from
the
few
words
of
her
talk
that
fell
upon
my
ear
i
should
have
thought
her
a
highly
educated
girl
she
is
replied
miss
barfoot
is
your
objection
does
she
aim
at
some
better
position
miss
barfoot
and
rhoda
exchanged
smiles
nothing
could
be
better
for
her
some
day
she
hopes
to
start
a
paper
of
her
own
and
to
learn
all
the
details
of
such
business
is
just
what
she
wants
oh
you
are
still
very
conventional
everard
you
meant
she
ought
to
take
up
something
graceful
and
pretty
something
ladylike
no
it
all
right
i
thoroughly
approve
and
when
miss
haven
starts
her
paper
miss
nunn
will
write
for
it
hope
so
assented
his
cousin
make
me
feel
that
i
am
in
touch
with
the
great
movements
of
our
time
it
delightful
to
know
you
but
come
now
is
there
any
way
in
which
i
could
help
mary
laughed
whatever
i
afraid
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
if
everard
had
pleased
himself
he
would
have
visited
the
house
in
queen
road
every
other
day
as
this
might
not
be
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
in
other
society
not
caring
to
read
much
or
otherwise
occupy
his
solitude
starting
with
one
or
two
acquaintances
in
london
people
of
means
and
position
he
easily
extended
his
social
sphere
had
he
cared
to
marry
he
might
notwithstanding
his
poverty
have
wooed
with
fair
chance
in
a
certain
wealthy
family
where
two
daughters
the
sole
children
plain
but
girls
waited
for
the
men
of
brains
who
should
appreciate
them
so
rare
in
society
these
men
of
brains
and
alas
so
frequently
deserted
by
their
wisdom
when
it
comes
to
choosing
a
wife
it
being
his
principle
to
reflect
on
every
possibility
barfoot
of
course
asked
himself
whether
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
approach
one
or
other
of
these
young
women
the
miss
brissendens
he
needed
a
larger
income
he
wanted
to
travel
in
a
more
satisfactory
way
than
during
his
late
absence
agnes
brissenden
struck
him
as
a
very
calm
and
sensible
girl
not
at
all
likely
to
marry
any
one
but
the
man
who
would
be
a
suitable
companion
for
her
and
probably
disposed
to
look
on
marriage
as
a
permanent
friendship
which
must
not
be
endangered
by
feminine
follies
she
had
no
beauty
but
mental
powers
above
the
average
superior
certainly
to
her
sister
it
was
worth
thinking
about
but
in
the
meantime
he
wanted
to
see
much
more
of
rhoda
nunn
rhoda
he
was
beginning
to
class
with
women
who
are
attractive
both
physically
and
mentally
strange
how
her
face
had
altered
to
his
perception
since
the
first
meeting
he
smiled
now
when
he
beheld
it
smiled
as
a
man
does
when
his
senses
are
pleasantly
affected
he
was
getting
to
know
it
so
well
to
be
prepared
for
its
constant
changes
to
watch
for
certain
movements
of
brows
or
lips
when
he
had
said
certain
things
that
forcible
holding
of
her
hand
had
marked
a
stage
in
progressive
appreciation
since
then
he
felt
a
desire
to
repeat
the
experiment
if
thy
mistress
some
rich
anger
shows
imprison
her
soft
hand
and
let
her
rave
the
lines
occurred
to
his
memory
and
he
understood
them
better
than
heretofore
it
would
delight
him
to
enrage
rhoda
and
then
to
detain
her
by
strength
to
overcome
her
senses
to
watch
her
long
lashes
droop
over
the
eloquent
eyes
but
this
was
something
very
like
being
in
love
and
he
by
no
means
wished
to
be
seriously
in
love
with
miss
nunn
it
was
another
three
weeks
before
he
had
an
opportunity
of
private
talk
with
her
trying
a
sunday
afternoon
about
four
he
found
rhoda
alone
in
the
miss
barfoot
was
out
of
town
rhoda
greeting
had
a
frank
friendliness
which
she
had
not
bestowed
upon
him
for
a
long
time
not
indeed
since
they
met
on
her
return
from
cheddar
she
looked
very
well
readily
laughed
and
seemed
altogether
in
a
disposition
barfoot
noticed
that
the
piano
was
open
you
play
he
inquired
that
i
should
still
have
to
ask
the
question
only
a
hymn
on
sunday
she
answered
hymn
not
i
like
some
of
the
old
tunes
very
much
they
remind
me
of
the
golden
age
your
own
life
you
mean
she
nodded
have
once
or
twice
spoken
of
that
time
as
if
you
were
not
quite
happy
in
the
present
course
i
am
not
quite
happy
what
woman
is
i
mean
what
woman
above
the
level
of
a
petted
everard
was
leaning
towards
her
on
the
head
of
the
couch
where
he
sat
he
gazed
into
her
face
fixedly
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
remove
some
of
your
discontents
i
would
more
gladly
than
i
can
tell
you
abound
in
good
nature
barfoot
she
replied
laughing
unfortunately
you
ca
change
the
world
the
world
at
large
but
might
i
not
change
your
views
of
it
in
some
respects
i
do
see
how
you
could
i
think
i
had
rather
have
my
own
view
than
any
you
might
wish
to
substitute
for
it
in
this
humour
she
seemed
more
than
ever
a
challenge
to
his
manhood
she
was
armed
at
all
points
she
feared
nothing
that
he
might
say
no
flush
of
apprehension
no
nervous
tremor
no
weak
yet
he
saw
her
as
a
woman
and
desirable
views
are
not
ignoble
he
murmured
hope
not
but
they
are
the
views
of
a
man
and
woman
ought
to
see
life
with
much
the
same
eyes
they
perhaps
so
i
am
not
sure
but
they
never
will
in
our
time
may
the
man
and
woman
who
have
thrown
away
prejudice
and
superstition
you
and
i
for
instance
those
words
have
such
different
meanings
in
your
judgment
i
should
seem
full
of
idle
prejudice
she
liked
this
conversation
he
read
pleasure
in
her
face
saw
in
her
eyes
a
glint
of
merry
defiance
and
his
pulses
throbbed
the
quicker
for
it
have
a
prejudice
against
for
instance
did
you
go
to
the
savoy
inquired
rhoda
absently
have
no
intention
of
talking
about
the
savoy
miss
nunn
it
is
teacup
time
but
as
yet
we
have
the
room
to
ourselves
rhoda
went
and
rang
the
bell
teacups
shall
come
at
once
he
laughed
slightly
and
looked
at
her
from
beneath
drooping
lids
rhoda
went
on
with
talk
of
trifles
until
the
tea
was
brought
and
she
had
given
a
cup
having
emptied
it
at
two
draughts
he
resumed
his
former
leaning
position
you
were
saying
that
you
had
a
prejudice
against
me
of
course
my
cousin
mary
is
accountable
for
that
mary
has
used
me
rather
before
ever
you
saw
me
i
represented
to
your
mind
something
very
disagreeable
indeed
that
was
too
bad
of
my
cousin
rhoda
sipping
her
tea
had
a
cold
uninterested
expression
did
know
of
this
he
proceeded
we
met
that
day
in
the
gardens
and
when
i
made
you
so
angry
was
disposed
to
jest
about
what
had
happened
neither
was
i
you
quite
misunderstood
me
will
you
tell
me
how
that
unpleasantness
came
to
an
end
yes
i
admitted
that
i
had
been
and
obstinate
delightful
obstinate
i
have
a
great
deal
of
that
in
my
character
all
the
active
part
of
my
life
was
one
long
fit
of
obstinacy
as
a
lad
i
determined
on
a
certain
career
and
i
stuck
to
it
in
spite
of
conscious
unfitness
in
spite
of
a
great
deal
of
suffering
out
of
sheer
obstinacy
i
wonder
whether
mary
ever
told
you
that
mentioned
something
of
the
kind
once
could
hardly
believe
it
i
dare
say
i
am
a
far
more
reasonable
being
now
i
have
changed
in
so
many
respects
that
i
hardly
know
my
old
self
when
i
look
back
on
it
above
all
in
my
thoughts
about
women
if
i
had
married
during
my
twenties
i
should
have
chosen
as
the
average
man
does
some
simpleton
with
unpleasant
results
if
i
marry
now
it
will
be
a
woman
of
character
and
brains
marry
in
the
legal
sense
i
never
shall
my
companion
must
be
as
independent
of
forms
as
i
am
myself
rhoda
looked
into
her
teacup
for
a
second
or
two
then
said
with
a
smile
also
are
a
reformer
that
direction
he
had
difficulty
in
suppressing
signs
of
nervousness
the
bold
declaration
had
come
without
forethought
and
rhoda
calm
acceptance
of
it
delighted
him
of
marriage
she
went
on
to
say
interest
me
much
but
this
particular
reform
does
seem
very
practical
it
is
trying
to
bring
about
an
ideal
state
of
things
whilst
we
are
yet
struggling
with
elementary
obstacles
do
advocate
this
liberty
for
all
mankind
only
for
those
who
are
worthy
of
it
what
she
laughed
a
little
the
sure
signs
of
worthiness
i
think
it
would
be
very
needful
to
know
them
everard
kept
a
grave
face
but
a
free
union
presupposes
equality
of
position
no
honest
man
would
propose
it
for
instance
to
a
woman
incapable
of
understanding
all
it
involved
or
incapable
of
resuming
her
separate
life
if
that
became
desirable
i
admit
all
the
difficulties
one
must
consider
those
of
feeling
as
well
as
the
material
if
my
wife
should
declare
that
she
must
be
released
i
might
suffer
grievously
but
being
a
man
of
some
intelligence
i
should
admit
that
the
suffering
could
be
helped
the
brutality
of
enforced
marriage
does
seem
to
me
an
alternative
worth
considering
it
would
seem
so
to
any
woman
of
the
kind
i
mean
would
she
have
the
courage
to
urge
one
grave
difficulty
that
he
left
aside
no
he
fancied
her
about
to
speak
but
she
ended
by
offering
him
another
cup
of
tea
all
that
is
your
ideal
he
said
have
to
do
with
the
subject
at
all
rhoda
answered
with
perhaps
a
trace
of
impatience
work
and
thought
are
for
the
women
who
do
not
marry
the
women
i
call
them
they
alone
interest
me
one
must
undertake
too
much
you
resolutely
class
yourself
with
them
course
i
do
therefore
you
have
certain
views
of
life
which
i
should
like
to
change
you
are
doing
good
work
but
i
had
rather
see
any
other
woman
in
the
world
devote
her
life
to
it
i
am
selfish
enough
to
wish
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
announced
and
mrs
widdowson
with
perfect
miss
nunn
rose
and
stepped
forward
barfoot
rising
more
slowly
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
husband
of
the
pretty
woman
whom
he
had
already
met
widdowson
surprised
and
amused
him
how
had
this
stiff
stern
fellow
with
the
grizzled
beard
won
such
a
wife
not
that
widdowson
seemed
a
remarkable
person
but
certainly
it
was
an
union
she
came
and
shook
hands
as
he
spoke
a
few
natural
words
everard
chanced
to
notice
that
the
husband
eye
was
upon
him
and
with
what
a
look
if
ever
a
man
declared
in
his
countenance
the
worst
species
of
jealous
temper
widdowson
did
so
his
fixed
smile
became
sardonic
presently
barfoot
and
he
were
introduced
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
but
everard
maintained
a
brief
conversation
just
to
observe
the
man
turning
at
length
he
began
to
talk
with
widdowson
and
because
he
was
conscious
of
the
jealous
eye
assumed
an
especial
sprightliness
an
air
of
familiar
pleasantry
to
which
the
lady
responded
but
with
a
nervous
hesitation
the
arrival
of
these
people
was
an
intense
annoyance
to
him
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
things
would
have
come
to
an
exciting
pass
between
rhoda
and
himself
he
would
have
heard
how
she
received
a
declaration
of
love
rhoda
notwithstanding
he
believed
that
he
was
not
without
power
over
her
she
liked
to
talk
with
him
enjoyed
the
freedom
he
allowed
himself
in
choice
of
subject
perhaps
no
man
before
had
ever
shown
an
appreciation
of
her
qualities
as
woman
but
she
would
not
yield
was
in
no
real
danger
from
his
nay
the
danger
was
to
his
own
peace
he
felt
that
resistance
would
intensify
the
ardour
of
his
wooing
and
possibly
end
by
making
him
a
victim
of
genuine
passion
well
let
her
enjoy
that
triumph
if
she
were
capable
of
winning
it
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
outstay
the
widdowsons
who
clearly
would
not
make
a
long
call
but
the
fates
were
against
him
another
visitor
arrived
a
lady
named
cosgrove
who
settled
herself
as
if
for
at
least
an
hour
worse
than
that
he
heard
her
say
to
rhoda
then
do
come
and
dine
with
us
do
i
beg
will
with
pleasure
was
miss
nunn
reply
you
wait
and
take
me
with
you
useless
to
stay
longer
as
soon
as
the
widdowsons
had
departed
he
went
up
to
rhoda
and
silently
offered
his
hand
she
scarcely
looked
at
him
and
did
not
in
the
least
return
his
pressure
rhoda
dined
at
cosgrove
and
was
home
again
at
eleven
when
the
house
was
locked
up
and
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
she
sat
in
the
library
turning
over
a
book
that
she
had
brought
from
her
friend
house
it
was
a
volume
of
essays
one
of
which
dealt
with
the
relations
between
the
sexes
in
a
very
modern
spirit
treating
the
subject
as
a
perfectly
open
one
and
arriving
at
unorthodox
conclusions
cosgrove
had
spoken
of
this
dissertation
with
lively
interest
rhoda
perused
it
very
carefully
pausing
now
and
then
to
reflect
in
this
reading
of
her
mind
barfoot
came
near
the
truth
no
man
had
ever
made
love
to
her
no
man
to
her
knowledge
had
ever
been
tempted
to
do
so
in
certain
moods
she
derived
satisfaction
from
this
thought
using
it
to
strengthen
her
life
purpose
having
passed
her
thirtieth
year
she
might
take
it
as
a
settled
thing
that
she
would
never
be
sought
in
marriage
and
so
could
shut
the
doors
on
every
instinct
tending
to
trouble
her
intellectual
decisions
but
these
instincts
sometimes
refused
to
be
thus
treated
as
miss
barfoot
told
her
she
was
very
young
for
her
years
young
in
physique
young
in
emotion
as
a
girl
she
had
dreamt
passionately
and
the
fires
of
her
nature
though
hidden
beneath
aggregations
of
moral
and
mental
attainment
were
not
yet
smothered
an
hour
of
lassitude
filled
her
with
despondency
none
the
less
real
because
she
was
ashamed
of
it
if
only
she
had
once
been
loved
like
other
women
if
she
had
listened
to
an
offer
of
devotion
and
rejected
it
her
heart
would
be
more
securely
at
peace
so
she
thought
secretly
she
deemed
it
a
hard
thing
never
to
have
known
that
common
triumph
of
her
sex
and
moreover
it
took
away
from
the
merit
of
her
position
as
a
leader
and
encourager
of
women
living
independently
there
might
be
some
who
said
or
thought
that
she
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
everard
barfoot
advances
surprised
her
not
a
little
judging
him
as
a
man
wholly
without
principle
she
supposed
at
first
that
this
was
merely
his
way
with
all
women
and
resented
it
as
impertinence
but
even
then
she
did
not
dislike
the
show
of
homage
what
her
mind
regarded
with
disdain
her
heart
was
all
but
willing
to
feed
upon
after
its
long
hunger
barfoot
interested
her
and
not
the
less
because
of
his
evil
reputation
here
was
one
of
the
men
for
whom
women
doubtless
more
than
one
had
sacrificed
themselves
she
could
not
but
regard
him
with
sexual
curiosity
and
her
interest
grew
her
curiosity
was
more
haunting
as
their
acquaintance
became
a
sort
of
friendship
she
found
that
her
moral
disapprobation
wavered
or
was
altogether
forgotten
perhaps
it
was
to
compensate
for
this
that
she
went
the
length
of
outraging
miss
barfoot
feelings
on
the
death
of
bella
royston
certainly
she
thought
with
much
frequency
of
barfoot
and
looked
forward
to
his
coming
never
had
she
wished
so
much
to
see
him
again
as
after
their
encounter
in
chelsea
gardens
and
on
that
account
she
forced
herself
to
hold
aloof
when
he
came
it
was
not
love
nor
the
beginning
of
love
she
judged
it
something
less
possible
to
avow
the
man
presence
affected
her
with
a
perturbation
which
she
had
no
difficulty
in
concealing
at
the
time
though
afterwards
it
distressed
and
shamed
her
she
took
refuge
in
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
quality
of
his
mind
made
an
impression
upon
her
that
his
talk
was
sympathetic
miss
barfoot
submitted
to
this
influence
she
confessed
that
her
cousin
talk
had
always
had
a
charm
for
her
could
it
be
that
this
man
reciprocated
and
more
than
reciprocated
her
complex
feeling
only
accident
had
prevented
him
from
making
an
avowal
of
love
unless
she
strangely
mistook
him
all
the
evening
she
had
dwelt
on
this
thought
it
grew
more
and
more
astonishing
was
he
worse
than
she
had
imagined
under
cover
of
independent
thought
of
serious
moral
theories
did
he
conceal
mere
profligacy
and
heartlessness
it
was
an
extraordinary
thing
to
have
to
ask
such
questions
in
relation
to
herself
it
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
to
learn
herself
anew
to
form
a
fresh
conception
of
her
personality
she
the
object
of
a
man
passion
and
the
thought
was
exultant
even
thus
late
then
the
satisfaction
of
vanity
had
been
granted
her
nay
not
of
vanity
alone
he
must
be
sincere
what
motive
could
he
possibly
have
for
playing
a
part
might
it
not
be
true
that
he
was
a
changed
man
in
certain
respects
and
that
a
genuine
emotion
at
length
had
control
of
him
if
so
she
had
only
to
wait
for
his
next
speech
with
her
in
private
she
could
not
misjudge
a
lover
pleading
the
interest
would
only
be
that
of
comedy
she
did
not
love
everard
barfoot
and
saw
no
likelihood
of
ever
doing
so
on
the
whole
a
subject
for
thankfulness
nor
could
he
seriously
anticipate
an
assent
to
his
proposal
for
a
free
union
in
declaring
that
legal
marriage
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
he
had
removed
his
to
the
region
of
mere
ideal
sentiment
but
if
he
loved
her
these
theories
would
sooner
or
later
be
swept
aside
he
would
plead
with
her
to
become
his
legal
wife
to
that
point
she
desired
to
bring
him
offer
what
he
might
she
would
not
accept
it
but
the
secret
chagrin
that
was
upon
her
would
be
removed
love
would
no
longer
be
the
privilege
of
other
women
to
reject
a
lover
in
so
many
respects
desirable
whom
so
many
women
might
envy
her
would
fortify
her
and
enable
her
to
go
forward
in
the
chosen
path
with
firmer
tread
it
was
one
the
fire
had
died
out
and
she
began
to
shiver
with
cold
but
a
trembling
of
joy
at
the
same
time
went
through
her
limbs
again
she
had
the
sense
of
exultation
of
triumph
she
would
not
dismiss
him
peremptorily
he
should
prove
the
quality
of
his
love
if
love
it
were
coming
so
late
the
experience
must
yield
her
all
it
had
to
yield
of
delight
and
contentment

the
air
was
not
unpleasant
they
had
no
object
before
them
and
for
five
minutes
they
occupied
themselves
with
their
thoughts
then
widdowson
stopped
we
go
home
again
he
asked
just
glancing
at
monica
then
letting
his
eyes
stray
vaguely
in
the
gloom
should
like
to
see
milly
but
i
afraid
i
can
hardly
take
you
there
to
call
with
me
not
a
very
poor
little
you
know
and
she
might
have
some
friend
is
there
anywhere
you
could
go
and
meet
me
afterwards
frowning
widdowson
looked
at
his
watch
six
there
is
much
time
suppose
you
go
home
and
let
me
come
back
by
myself
you
would
mind
for
once
i
should
like
so
much
to
have
a
talk
with
milly
if
i
got
back
about
nine
or
i
could
have
a
little
supper
and
that
all
i
should
want
he
answered
abruptly
but
i
ca
have
you
going
about
alone
at
night
not
answered
monica
with
a
just
perceptible
note
of
irritation
you
afraid
i
shall
be
robbed
or
murdered
but
you
must
be
alone
i
always
use
to
be
alone
he
made
an
angry
gesture
have
begged
you
not
to
speak
of
that
why
do
you
say
what
you
know
is
disagreeable
to
me
you
used
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
that
you
never
ought
to
have
been
obliged
to
do
and
it
very
painful
to
remember
it
monica
seeing
that
people
were
approaching
walked
on
and
neither
spoke
until
they
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
road
think
we
had
better
go
home
widdowson
at
length
remarked
you
wish
it
but
i
really
do
see
why
i
should
call
on
milly
now
that
we
are
here
did
you
speak
of
it
before
we
left
home
you
ought
to
be
more
methodical
monica
each
morning
i
always
plan
how
my
day
is
to
be
spent
and
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
do
the
same
then
you
would
be
so
restless
and
uncertain
i
go
to
rutland
street
said
monica
without
heeding
this
admonition
you
leave
me
there
for
an
hour
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
should
have
thought
you
might
walk
about
it
a
pity
you
do
know
more
people
edmund
it
would
make
things
so
much
pleasanter
for
you
in
the
end
he
consented
to
see
her
safely
as
far
as
rutland
street
occupy
himself
for
an
hour
and
come
back
for
her
they
went
by
cab
which
was
dismissed
in
hampstead
road
widdowson
did
not
turn
away
until
he
had
ocular
proof
of
his
wife
admittance
to
the
house
where
miss
vesper
lived
and
even
then
he
walked
no
farther
than
the
neighbouring
streets
returning
about
every
ten
minutes
to
watch
the
house
from
a
short
distance
as
though
he
feared
monica
might
have
some
project
of
escape
his
look
was
very
bilious
trudging
mechanically
hither
and
thither
where
fewest
people
were
to
be
met
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
clumped
to
a
dismal
rhythm
with
the
end
of
his
in
the
three
or
four
months
since
his
marriage
he
seemed
to
have
grown
older
he
no
longer
held
himself
so
upright
at
the
very
moment
agreed
upon
he
was
waiting
close
by
the
house
five
minutes
passed
twice
he
had
looked
at
his
watch
and
he
grew
excessively
impatient
stamping
as
if
it
were
necessary
to
keep
himself
warm
another
five
minutes
and
he
uttered
a
nervous
ejaculation
he
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
knock
at
the
door
when
monica
came
forth
have
been
waiting
here
long
i
hope
she
said
cheerfully
minutes
but
it
does
matter
very
sorry
we
were
talking
on
but
one
must
always
be
punctual
i
wish
i
could
impress
that
upon
you
life
without
punctuality
is
quite
impossible
very
sorry
edmund
i
will
be
more
careful
please
do
lecture
me
dear
how
shall
we
go
home
had
better
take
a
cab
to
victoria
no
knowing
how
long
we
may
have
to
wait
for
a
train
when
we
get
there
do
be
so
grumpy
where
have
you
been
all
the
time
walking
about
what
else
was
i
to
do
on
the
drive
they
held
no
conversation
at
victoria
they
were
delayed
about
half
an
hour
before
a
train
started
for
herne
hill
monica
sat
in
a
and
her
husband
trudged
about
the
platform
still
clumping
rhythmically
with
his
stick
their
sunday
custom
was
to
dine
at
one
and
at
six
to
have
tea
widdowson
hated
the
slightest
interference
with
domestic
routine
and
he
had
reluctantly
indulged
monica
desire
to
go
to
chelsea
this
afternoon
hunger
was
now
added
to
his
causes
of
discontent
us
have
something
to
eat
at
once
he
said
on
entering
the
house
disorder
really
wo
do
we
must
manage
better
somehow
without
replying
monica
rang
the
bell
and
gave
orders
little
change
had
been
made
in
the
interior
of
the
house
since
its
master
marriage
the
adjoining
the
principal
was
adapted
to
monica
use
and
a
few
ornaments
were
added
to
the
unlike
his
deceased
brother
widdowson
had
the
elements
of
artistic
taste
in
furnishing
his
abode
he
took
counsel
with
approved
decorators
and
at
moderate
cost
had
made
himself
a
home
which
presented
no
original
features
but
gave
no
offence
to
a
cultivated
eye
the
first
sight
of
the
rooms
pleased
monica
greatly
she
declared
that
all
was
perfect
nothing
need
be
altered
in
those
days
if
she
had
bidden
him
spend
a
hundred
pounds
on
reconstruction
the
lover
would
have
obeyed
delighted
to
hear
her
express
a
wish
though
competence
had
come
to
him
only
after
a
lifetime
of
narrow
means
widdowson
felt
no
temptation
to
parsimony
secure
in
his
income
he
grudged
no
expenditure
that
could
bring
himself
or
his
wife
satisfaction
on
the
in
cornwall
devon
and
somerset
it
lasted
about
seven
weeks
monica
learnt
among
other
things
less
agreeable
that
her
husband
was
generous
with
money
he
was
anxious
she
should
dress
well
though
only
as
monica
soon
discovered
for
his
own
gratification
soon
after
they
had
settled
down
at
home
she
equipped
herself
for
the
cold
season
and
widdowson
cared
little
about
the
price
so
long
as
the
effect
of
her
new
costumes
was
pleasing
to
him
are
making
a
butterfly
of
me
said
monica
merrily
when
he
expressed
strong
approval
of
a
bright
morning
dress
that
had
just
come
home
beautiful
woman
he
replied
with
the
nervous
gravity
which
still
possessed
him
when
complimenting
her
or
saying
tender
things
beautiful
woman
ought
to
be
beautifully
clad
at
the
same
time
he
endeavoured
to
impress
her
with
the
gravest
sense
of
a
married
woman
obligations
his
raptures
genuine
enough
were
sometimes
interrupted
in
the
oddest
way
if
monica
chanced
to
utter
a
careless
remark
of
which
he
could
not
strictly
approve
and
such
interruptions
frequently
became
the
opportunity
for
a
long
and
solemn
review
of
the
wifely
status
without
much
trouble
he
had
brought
her
into
a
daily
routine
which
satisfied
him
during
the
whole
of
the
morning
she
was
to
be
absorbed
in
household
cares
in
the
afternoon
he
would
take
her
to
walk
or
drive
and
the
evening
he
wished
her
to
spend
either
in
or
library
occupied
with
a
book
monica
soon
found
that
his
idea
of
wedded
happiness
was
that
they
should
always
be
together
most
reluctantly
he
consented
to
her
going
any
distance
alone
for
whatever
purpose
public
entertainments
he
regarded
with
no
great
favour
but
when
he
saw
how
monica
enjoyed
herself
at
concert
or
theatre
he
made
no
objection
to
indulging
her
at
intervals
of
a
fortnight
or
so
his
own
fondness
for
music
made
this
compliance
easier
he
was
jealous
of
her
forming
new
acquaintances
indifferent
to
society
himself
he
thought
his
wife
should
be
satisfied
with
her
present
friends
and
could
not
understand
why
she
wished
to
see
them
so
often
the
girl
was
docile
and
for
a
time
he
imagined
that
there
would
never
be
conflict
between
his
will
and
hers
whilst
enjoying
their
holiday
they
naturally
went
everywhere
together
and
were
scarce
an
hour
out
of
each
other
presence
day
or
night
in
quiet
spots
by
the
seashore
when
they
sat
in
solitude
widdowson
tongue
was
loosened
and
he
poured
forth
his
philosophy
of
life
with
the
happy
assurance
that
monica
would
listen
passively
his
devotion
to
her
proved
itself
in
a
thousand
ways
week
after
week
he
grew
if
anything
more
kind
more
tender
yet
in
his
view
of
their
relations
he
was
unconsciously
the
most
complete
despot
a
monument
of
male
autocracy
never
had
it
occurred
to
widdowson
that
a
wife
remains
an
individual
with
rights
and
obligations
independent
of
her
wifely
condition
everything
he
said
presupposed
his
own
supremacy
he
took
for
granted
that
it
was
his
to
direct
hers
to
be
guided
a
display
of
energy
purpose
ambition
on
monica
part
which
had
no
reference
to
domestic
pursuits
would
have
gravely
troubled
him
at
once
he
would
have
set
himself
to
subdue
with
all
gentleness
impulses
so
inimical
to
his
idea
of
the
married
state
it
rejoiced
him
that
she
spoke
with
so
little
sympathy
of
the
principles
supported
by
miss
barfoot
and
miss
nunn
these
persons
seemed
to
him
but
grievously
mistaken
miss
nunn
he
judged
and
hoped
in
secret
that
monica
would
not
long
remain
on
terms
of
friendship
with
her
of
course
his
wife
former
pursuits
were
an
abomination
to
him
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
them
referred
to
sphere
is
the
home
monica
unfortunately
girls
are
often
obliged
to
go
out
and
earn
their
living
but
this
is
unnatural
a
necessity
which
advanced
civilization
will
altogether
abolish
you
shall
read
john
ruskin
every
word
he
says
about
women
is
good
and
precious
if
a
woman
can
neither
have
a
home
of
her
own
nor
find
occupation
in
any
one
else
she
is
deeply
to
be
pitied
her
life
is
bound
to
be
unhappy
i
sincerely
believe
that
an
educated
woman
had
better
become
a
domestic
servant
than
try
to
imitate
the
life
of
a
man
monica
seemed
to
listen
attentively
but
before
long
she
accustomed
herself
to
wear
this
look
whilst
in
truth
she
was
thinking
her
own
thoughts
and
as
often
as
not
they
were
of
a
nature
little
suspected
by
her
prosing
companion
he
believed
himself
the
happiest
of
men
he
had
taken
a
daring
step
but
fortune
smiled
upon
him
monica
was
all
he
had
imagined
in
his
knowledge
of
her
had
as
yet
brought
to
light
no
single
untruth
no
trait
of
character
that
he
could
condemn
that
she
returned
his
love
he
would
not
and
could
not
doubt
and
something
she
said
to
him
one
day
early
in
their
honeymoon
filled
up
the
measure
of
his
bliss
a
change
you
have
made
in
my
life
edmund
how
much
i
have
to
thank
you
for
that
was
what
he
had
hoped
to
hear
he
had
thought
it
himself
had
wondered
whether
monica
saw
her
position
in
this
light
and
when
the
words
actually
fell
from
her
lips
he
glowed
with
joy
this
to
his
mind
was
the
perfect
relation
of
wife
to
husband
she
must
look
up
to
him
as
her
benefactor
her
providence
it
would
have
pleased
him
still
better
if
she
had
not
possessed
a
penny
of
her
own
but
happily
monica
seemed
never
to
give
a
thought
to
the
sum
at
her
disposal
surely
he
was
the
easiest
of
men
to
live
with
when
he
first
became
aware
that
monica
suffered
an
occasional
discontent
it
caused
him
troublous
surprise
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
she
desired
more
freedom
of
movement
he
became
anxious
suspicious
irritable
nothing
like
a
quarrel
had
yet
taken
place
between
them
but
widdowson
began
to
perceive
that
he
must
exert
authority
in
a
way
he
had
imagined
would
never
be
necessary
all
his
fears
after
all
were
not
groundless
monica
undomestic
life
and
perhaps
the
association
with
those
chelsea
people
had
left
results
upon
her
mind
by
way
of
mild
discipline
he
first
of
all
suggested
a
closer
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
house
would
it
not
be
well
if
she
spent
an
hour
a
day
in
sewing
or
fancy
work
monica
so
far
obeyed
as
to
provide
herself
with
some
plain
needlework
but
widdowson
watching
with
keen
eye
soon
remarked
that
her
use
of
the
needle
was
only
a
feint
he
lay
awake
o
nights
pondering
darkly
on
the
present
evening
he
was
more
decidedly
out
of
temper
than
ever
hitherto
he
satisfied
his
hunger
hurriedly
and
in
silence
then
observing
that
monica
ate
only
a
few
morsels
he
took
offence
at
this
afraid
you
are
not
well
dear
you
have
had
no
appetite
for
several
days
much
as
usual
i
think
she
replied
absently
they
went
into
the
library
commonly
their
resort
of
an
evening
widdowson
possessed
several
hundred
volumes
of
english
literature
most
of
them
the
works
which
are
supposed
to
be
indispensible
to
a
man
though
very
few
men
even
make
a
pretence
of
reading
them
widdowson
deemed
it
his
duty
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
great
the
solid
authors
nor
was
his
study
of
them
affectation
for
the
poets
he
had
little
taste
the
novelists
he
considered
only
profitable
in
intervals
of
graver
reading
but
history
political
economy
even
metaphysics
genuinely
appealed
to
him
he
had
always
two
or
three
solid
books
on
hand
each
with
its
marker
he
studied
them
at
stated
hours
and
always
sitting
at
a
table
a
notebook
open
beside
him
a
little
work
once
todd
manual
had
formed
his
method
and
inspired
him
with
zeal
it
being
sunday
he
took
down
a
volume
of
barrow
sermons
though
not
strictly
orthodox
in
religious
faith
he
conformed
to
the
practices
of
the
church
of
england
and
since
his
marriage
had
been
more
scrupulous
on
this
point
than
before
he
abhorred
unorthodoxy
in
a
woman
and
would
not
on
any
account
have
suffered
monica
to
surmise
that
he
had
his
doubts
concerning
any
article
of
the
christian
faith
like
most
men
of
his
kind
he
viewed
religion
as
a
precious
and
powerful
instrument
for
directing
the
female
conscience
frequently
he
read
aloud
to
his
wife
but
this
evening
he
showed
no
intention
of
doing
so
monica
however
sat
unoccupied
after
glancing
at
her
once
or
twice
he
said
reprovingly
you
finished
your
sunday
book
quite
but
i
do
care
to
read
just
now
the
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
monica
herself
you
accepted
luke
invitation
to
dinner
she
asked
have
declined
it
was
the
reply
carelessly
given
monica
bit
her
lip
why
we
need
discuss
that
over
again
monica
his
eyes
were
still
on
the
book
and
he
stirred
impatiently
urged
his
wife
you
mean
to
break
with
her
altogether
if
so
i
think
it
very
unwise
edmund
what
an
opinion
you
must
have
of
me
if
you
think
i
ca
see
people
faults
i
know
it
very
true
all
you
say
about
her
but
she
wishes
to
be
kind
to
us
i
sure
and
i
like
to
see
something
of
a
life
so
different
from
our
own
widdowson
drummed
on
the
floor
with
his
foot
in
a
few
moments
ignoring
monica
remarks
he
stroked
his
beard
and
asked
with
a
show
of
casual
interest
was
it
you
knew
that
mr
barfoot
had
met
him
before
when
i
went
there
on
the
saturday
widdowson
eyes
fell
his
brow
was
wrinkled
often
there
then
do
know
perhaps
he
is
he
miss
barfoot
cousin
you
know
have
seen
him
more
than
once
before
why
do
you
ask
it
was
only
that
he
seemed
to
speak
as
if
you
were
old
acquaintances
his
way
i
suppose
monica
had
already
learnt
that
the
jealousy
which
widdowson
so
often
betrayed
before
their
manage
still
lurked
in
his
mind
perceiving
why
he
put
these
questions
she
could
not
look
entirely
unconcerned
and
the
sense
of
his
eye
being
upon
her
caused
her
some
annoyance
talked
to
him
did
you
she
said
changing
her
position
in
the
deep
chair
the
kind
of
talk
that
is
possible
with
a
perfect
stranger
i
suppose
he
is
in
some
profession
really
do
know
why
edmund
does
he
interest
you
that
one
likes
to
know
something
about
the
people
that
are
introduced
to
one
wife
widdowson
answered
rather
acridly
their
bedtime
was
ten
precisely
at
that
moment
widdowson
closed
his
book
glad
to
be
relieved
from
the
pretence
of
reading
and
walked
over
the
lower
part
of
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
right
he
had
a
passion
for
routine
every
night
before
going
upstairs
he
did
a
number
of
little
things
in
unvarying
sequence
changed
the
calendar
for
next
day
made
perfect
order
on
his
wound
up
his
watch
and
so
on
that
monica
could
not
direct
her
habits
with
like
exactitude
was
frequently
a
distress
to
him
if
she
chanced
to
forget
any
most
trivial
detail
of
daily
custom
he
looked
very
solemn
and
begged
her
to
be
more
vigilant
next
morning
after
breakfast
as
monica
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
rather
cheerlessly
at
a
leaden
sky
her
husband
came
towards
her
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
she
turned
and
saw
that
his
face
no
longer
wore
the
austere
expression
which
had
made
her
miserable
last
night
and
even
during
the
meal
this
morning
we
friends
he
said
with
the
attempt
at
playfulness
which
always
made
him
look
particularly
awkward
course
we
are
monica
answered
smiling
but
not
regarding
him
he
behave
gruffly
last
night
to
his
little
girl
a
little
what
can
the
old
bear
do
to
show
that
he
sorry
be
gruff
again
old
bear
is
sometimes
an
old
goose
as
well
and
torments
himself
in
the
silliest
way
tell
him
so
if
ever
he
begins
to
behave
badly
is
it
morning
i
come
to
you
at
eleven
if
we
have
a
nice
quiet
comfortable
week
i
take
you
to
the
crystal
palace
concert
next
saturday
monica
nodded
cheerfully
and
went
off
to
look
after
her
housekeeping
the
week
was
in
all
respects
what
widdowson
desired
not
a
soul
came
to
the
house
monica
went
to
see
no
one
save
on
two
days
it
rained
sleeted
drizzled
fogged
on
those
two
afternoons
they
had
an
walk
saturday
brought
no
improvement
of
the
atmosphere
but
widdowson
was
in
his
happiest
mood
he
cheerfully
kept
his
promise
about
the
concert
as
they
sat
together
at
night
his
contentment
overflowed
in
tenderness
like
that
of
the
first
days
of
marriage
why
ca
we
always
live
like
this
what
have
we
to
do
with
other
people
let
us
be
everything
to
each
other
and
forget
that
any
one
else
exists
ca
help
thinking
that
a
mistake
monica
ventured
to
reply
one
thing
if
we
saw
more
people
we
should
have
so
much
more
to
talk
about
when
we
are
alone
better
to
talk
about
ourselves
i
should
care
if
i
never
again
saw
any
living
creature
but
you
you
see
the
old
bear
loves
his
little
girl
better
than
she
loves
him
monica
was
silent
it
true
you
do
feel
that
my
company
would
be
enough
for
you
it
be
right
if
i
ceased
to
care
for
every
one
else
there
are
my
sisters
i
ought
to
have
asked
virginia
to
come
i
sure
she
thinks
i
neglect
her
and
it
must
be
dreadful
living
all
alone
like
she
does
they
made
up
their
mind
yet
about
the
school
i
sure
the
right
thing
for
them
to
do
if
the
venture
were
to
fail
and
they
lost
money
we
would
see
that
they
never
came
to
want
so
timid
about
it
and
it
would
be
nice
you
know
to
feel
they
were
going
to
be
dependent
upon
us
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
i
had
better
go
and
see
virgie
morning
and
bring
her
back
for
dinner
you
like
widdowson
assented
slowly
why
not
send
a
message
and
ask
her
to
come
here
had
rather
go
it
makes
a
change
for
me
this
was
a
word
widdowson
detested
change
on
monica
lips
always
seemed
to
mean
a
release
from
his
society
but
he
swallowed
his
dissatisfaction
and
finally
consented
to
the
arrangement
virginia
came
to
dinner
and
stayed
until
nightfall
thanks
to
her
sister
kindness
she
was
better
clad
than
in
former
days
but
her
face
signified
no
improvement
of
health
the
enthusiasm
with
which
rhoda
nunn
had
inspired
her
appeared
only
in
fitful
affectations
of
interest
when
monica
pressed
her
concerning
the
projected
undertaking
down
in
somerset
in
general
she
had
a
dreamy
reticent
look
and
became
uncomfortable
when
any
one
gazed
at
her
inquiringly
her
talk
was
of
the
most
insignificant
things
this
afternoon
she
spent
nearly
half
an
hour
in
describing
a
kitten
which
conisbee
had
given
her
care
of
the
little
animal
appeared
to
have
absorbed
her
whole
attention
for
many
days
past
another
visitor
was
newdick
the
city
clerk
who
had
been
present
at
monica
wedding
he
and
luke
widdowson
were
the
sole
friends
of
her
husband
that
monica
had
seen
newdick
enjoyed
coming
to
herne
hill
always
lugubrious
to
begin
with
he
gradually
cheered
up
and
by
the
time
for
departure
was
loquacious
but
he
had
the
oddest
ideas
of
talk
suitable
to
a
had
he
been
permitted
he
would
have
held
forth
to
monica
by
the
hour
on
the
history
of
the
business
firm
which
he
had
served
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
this
subject
alone
could
animate
him
his
anecdotes
were
as
often
as
not
quite
unintelligible
save
to
people
of
city
experience
for
all
that
monica
did
not
dislike
the
man
he
was
a
good
simple
unselfish
fellow
and
to
her
he
behaved
with
exaggeration
of
respect
a
few
days
later
monica
had
a
sudden
fit
of
illness
her
marriage
and
the
long
holiday
had
given
her
a
much
healthier
appearance
than
when
she
was
at
the
shop
but
this
present
disorder
resembled
the
attack
she
had
suffered
in
rutland
street
widdowson
hoped
that
it
signified
a
condition
for
which
he
was
anxiously
waiting
that
however
did
not
seem
to
be
the
case
the
medical
man
who
was
called
in
asked
questions
about
the
patient
mode
of
life
did
she
take
enough
exercise
had
she
wholesome
variety
of
occupation
at
these
inquiries
widdowson
inwardly
raged
he
was
tormented
with
a
suspicion
that
they
resulted
from
something
monica
had
said
to
the
doctor
she
kept
her
bed
for
three
or
four
days
and
on
rising
could
only
sit
by
the
fireside
silent
melancholy
widdowson
indulged
his
hope
though
monica
herself
laughed
it
aside
and
even
showed
annoyance
if
he
return
to
the
subject
her
temper
was
strangely
uncertain
some
chance
word
in
a
conversation
would
irritate
her
beyond
endurance
and
after
an
outburst
of
petulant
displeasure
she
became
obstinately
mute
at
other
times
she
behaved
with
such
exquisite
docility
and
sweetness
that
widdowson
was
beside
himself
with
rapture
after
a
week
of
convalescence
she
said
one
morning
we
go
away
somewhere
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
quite
well
staying
here
wretched
weather
replied
her
husband
but
there
are
places
where
it
would
be
like
this
you
mind
the
expense
do
you
edmund
not
i
indeed
but
were
you
thinking
of
abroad
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
had
suddenly
brightened
would
it
be
possible
people
do
go
out
of
england
in
the
winter
widdowson
plucked
at
his
grizzled
beard
and
fingered
his
it
was
a
temptation
why
not
take
her
away
to
some
place
where
only
foreigners
and
strangers
would
be
about
them
yet
the
enterprise
alarmed
him
have
never
been
out
of
england
he
said
with
misgiving
the
more
reason
why
we
should
go
i
think
miss
barfoot
could
advise
us
about
it
she
has
been
abroad
i
know
and
she
has
so
many
friends
do
see
any
need
to
consult
miss
barfoot
he
replied
stiffly
am
not
such
a
helpless
man
monica
yet
a
feeling
of
inability
to
grapple
with
such
an
undertaking
as
this
grew
on
him
the
more
he
thought
of
it
naturally
his
mind
busied
itself
with
such
vague
knowledge
as
he
had
gathered
of
those
places
in
the
south
of
france
where
rich
english
people
go
to
escape
their
own
climate
nice
cannes
he
could
not
imagine
himself
setting
forth
to
these
regions
doubtless
it
was
possible
to
travel
thither
and
live
there
when
one
arrived
without
a
knowledge
of
french
but
he
pictured
all
sorts
of
humiliating
situations
resulting
from
his
ignorance
above
everything
he
dreaded
humiliation
in
monica
sight
it
would
be
intolerable
to
have
her
comparing
him
with
men
who
spoke
foreign
languages
and
were
at
home
on
the
continent
nevertheless
he
wrote
to
his
friend
newdick
and
invited
him
to
dine
solely
for
the
purpose
of
talking
over
this
question
with
him
in
private
after
dinner
he
broached
the
subject
to
his
surprise
newdick
had
ideas
concerning
nice
and
cannes
and
such
places
he
had
heard
about
them
from
the
junior
partner
of
his
firm
a
young
gentleman
who
talked
largely
of
his
experiences
abroad
immoral
lot
there
he
said
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
goings
on
but
that
among
the
foreigners
is
it
thereupon
newdick
revealed
his
acquaintance
with
english
literature
you
ever
read
any
of
ouida
novels
i
never
did
advise
you
to
before
you
think
of
taking
your
wife
over
there
she
writes
a
great
deal
about
those
parts
people
get
mixed
up
so
it
seems
you
could
live
by
yourself
you
have
to
eat
at
public
tables
and
you
have
all
sorts
of
people
trying
to
make
acquaintance
with
widdowson
they
a
queer
lot
i
believe
he
abandoned
the
thought
at
once
and
utterly
when
monica
learnt
this
he
gave
only
vague
and
unsatisfactory
reasons
she
fell
back
into
her
despondent
mood
for
a
whole
day
she
scarcely
uttered
a
word
on
the
next
day
in
the
dreary
afternoon
they
were
surprised
by
a
call
from
luke
the
widow
less
than
ever
a
widow
in
externals
came
in
with
a
burst
of
exuberant
spirits
and
began
to
scold
the
moping
couple
like
an
affectionate
parent
are
you
silly
young
people
coming
to
an
end
of
your
honeymoon
do
you
sit
here
day
after
day
and
call
each
other
pretty
names
really
it
very
charming
in
its
way
i
never
knew
such
an
obstinate
monica
my
beauty
change
your
frock
and
come
with
me
to
look
up
the
hodgson
bulls
they
quite
too
awful
i
ca
face
them
alone
but
i
bound
to
keep
in
with
them
be
off
and
let
me
pitch
into
your
young
man
for
daring
to
refuse
my
dinner
do
you
know
sir
that
my
invitations
are
like
those
of
royalty
polite
commands
widdowson
kept
silence
waiting
to
see
what
his
wife
would
do
he
could
not
with
decency
object
to
her
accompanying
luke
yet
hated
the
thought
of
such
a
step
a
grim
smile
on
his
face
he
sat
stiffly
staring
at
the
wall
to
his
inexpressible
delight
monica
after
a
short
hesitation
excused
herself
she
was
not
well
she
did
not
feel
able
laughed
the
visitor
see
i
see
do
just
as
you
like
of
course
but
if
edmund
has
any
this
phrase
she
had
learnt
from
a
young
gentleman
late
of
oxford
now
of
tattersall
and
elsewhere
wo
let
you
sit
here
in
the
dumps
you
in
the
dumps
i
can
see
the
vivacious
lady
did
not
stay
long
when
she
had
rustled
forth
again
to
her
carriage
widdowson
broke
into
a
paean
of
amorous
gratitude
what
could
he
do
to
show
how
he
appreciated
monica
on
his
behalf
for
a
day
or
two
he
was
absent
rather
mysteriously
and
in
the
meantime
made
up
his
mind
after
consultation
with
newdick
to
take
his
wife
for
a
holiday
in
guernsey
monica
when
she
heard
of
this
project
was
at
first
moderately
grateful
but
in
a
day
or
two
showed
by
reviving
strength
and
spirits
that
she
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
departure
her
husband
advertised
for
lodgings
in
peter
port
he
would
not
face
the
disagreeable
chances
of
a
hotel
in
a
fortnight
time
all
their
preparations
were
made
during
their
absence
which
might
extend
over
a
month
virginia
was
to
live
at
herne
hill
in
supervision
of
the
two
servants
on
the
last
sunday
monica
went
to
see
her
friends
in
queen
road
widdowson
was
ashamed
to
offer
an
objection
he
much
disliked
her
going
there
alone
but
disliked
equally
the
thought
of
accompanying
her
for
at
miss
barfoot
he
could
not
pretend
to
sit
stand
or
converse
with
ease
it
happened
that
cosgrove
was
again
calling
on
the
first
occasion
of
meeting
with
monica
this
lady
paid
her
no
particular
attention
she
addressed
her
in
a
friendly
manner
and
their
conversation
led
to
the
discovery
that
both
of
them
were
about
to
spend
the
ensuing
month
in
the
same
place
cosgrove
hoped
they
might
occasionally
see
each
other
of
this
coincidence
monica
thought
better
to
say
nothing
on
her
return
home
she
could
not
be
sure
that
her
husband
might
not
at
the
last
moment
decide
to
stay
at
herne
hill
rather
than
incur
the
risk
of
her
meeting
an
acquaintance
in
guernsey
on
this
point
he
could
not
be
trusted
to
exercise
common
sense
for
the
first
time
monica
had
a
secret
she
desired
to
keep
from
him
and
the
necessity
was
one
which
could
not
but
have
an
unfavourable
effect
on
her
manner
of
regarding
widdowson
they
were
to
start
on
monday
evening
through
the
day
her
mind
was
divided
between
joy
in
the
thought
of
seeing
a
new
part
of
the
world
and
a
sense
of
weary
dislike
for
her
home
she
had
not
understood
until
now
how
terrible
would
be
the
prospect
of
living
here
for
a
long
time
with
no
companionship
but
her
husband
on
the
return
that
prospect
would
lie
before
her
but
no
their
way
of
life
must
somehow
be
modified
on
that
she
was
resolved
chapter
xvi
health
from
the
sea
from
herne
hill
to
peter
port
was
a
change
which
made
of
monica
a
new
creature
the
weather
could
not
have
been
more
propitious
day
after
day
of
still
air
and
magnificent
sky
with
temperature
which
made
a
brisk
walk
at
any
hour
thoroughly
enjoyable
yet
allowed
one
to
sit
at
ease
in
the
midday
sunshine
their
lodgings
were
in
the
best
part
of
the
town
high
up
looking
forth
over
blue
sea
to
the
cliffs
of
sark
widdowson
congratulated
himself
on
having
taken
this
step
it
was
like
a
revival
of
his
honeymoon
never
since
their
settling
down
at
home
had
monica
been
so
grateful
so
affectionate
why
his
wife
was
what
he
had
thought
her
from
the
first
perfect
in
every
wifely
attribute
how
lovely
she
looked
as
she
sat
down
to
the
after
breathing
sea
air
at
the
open
windows
in
her
charming
dress
her
black
hair
arranged
in
some
new
fashion
just
to
please
him
or
when
she
walked
with
him
about
the
quays
obviously
admired
by
men
who
passed
them
or
when
she
seated
herself
in
the
open
carriage
for
a
drive
which
would
warm
her
cheeks
and
make
her
lips
redder
and
sweeter
she
said
to
him
one
evening
as
they
talked
by
the
fireside
you
think
you
take
life
rather
too
gravely
he
laughed
do
i
seem
to
enjoy
myself
yes
just
now
but
still
in
a
rather
serious
way
one
would
think
you
always
had
cares
on
your
mind
and
were
struggling
to
get
rid
of
them
have
a
care
in
the
world
i
am
the
most
blessed
of
mortals
you
ought
to
think
yourself
but
when
we
get
back
again
how
will
it
be
you
wo
be
angry
with
me
i
really
do
think
i
can
live
again
as
we
were
doing
live
as
his
brow
darkened
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
ought
to
have
more
enjoyment
she
pursued
courageously
of
the
numbers
of
people
who
live
a
dull
monotonous
life
just
because
they
ca
help
it
how
they
would
envy
us
with
so
much
money
to
spend
free
to
do
just
what
we
like
does
it
seem
a
pity
to
sit
there
day
after
day
alone
my
darling
he
implored
that
makes
me
think
you
really
love
me
i
want
you
to
see
what
i
mean
i
am
not
one
of
the
silly
people
who
care
for
nothing
but
amusement
but
i
do
think
we
might
enjoy
our
lives
more
when
we
are
in
london
we
sha
live
for
ever
you
know
is
it
right
to
spend
day
after
day
sitting
there
in
the
house
come
come
we
have
our
occupations
surely
it
ought
to
be
a
pleasure
to
you
to
see
that
the
house
is
kept
in
order
there
are
duties
i
know
but
these
duties
i
could
perform
in
an
hour
or
two
thoroughly
thoroughly
enough
my
opinion
monica
a
woman
ought
never
to
be
so
happy
as
when
she
is
looking
after
her
home
it
was
the
old
pedantic
tone
his
figure
in
sympathy
with
it
abandoned
an
easy
attitude
and
became
awkward
but
monica
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
alarmed
during
the
past
week
she
had
conducted
herself
so
as
to
smooth
the
way
for
this
very
discussion
unsuspecting
husband
wish
to
do
my
duty
she
said
in
a
firm
tone
i
do
think
it
right
to
make
dull
work
for
oneself
when
one
might
be
living
i
do
think
it
living
to
go
on
week
after
week
like
that
if
we
were
poor
and
i
had
a
lot
of
children
to
look
after
as
well
as
all
the
housework
to
do
i
believe
i
should
grumble
at
least
i
hope
i
should
i
should
know
that
i
ought
to
do
what
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
and
make
the
best
of
it
but
the
best
of
it
he
interrupted
indignantly
an
expression
to
use
it
would
not
only
be
your
duty
dear
but
your
privilege
a
moment
edmund
if
you
were
a
shopman
earning
fifteen
shillings
a
week
and
working
from
early
morning
to
late
at
night
should
you
think
it
not
only
your
duty
but
your
privilege
he
made
a
wrathful
gesture
comparison
is
there
i
should
be
earning
a
hard
livelihood
by
slaving
for
other
people
but
a
married
woman
who
works
in
her
own
home
for
her
husband
children
is
work
and
when
a
woman
is
overburdened
with
it
she
must
find
it
difficult
not
to
weary
of
home
and
husband
and
children
all
together
but
of
course
i
do
mean
to
say
that
my
work
is
too
hard
all
i
mean
is
that
i
do
see
why
any
one
should
work
and
why
life
should
be
as
full
of
enjoyment
as
possible
you
have
got
these
ideas
from
those
people
at
chelsea
that
is
exactly
why
i
do
care
for
you
to
see
much
of
them
i
utterly
disapprove
of
you
are
mistaken
miss
barfoot
and
miss
nunn
are
all
for
work
they
take
life
as
seriously
as
you
do
what
kind
of
work
they
want
to
make
women
unwomanly
to
make
them
unfit
for
the
only
duties
women
ought
to
perform
you
know
very
well
my
opinions
about
that
kind
of
thing
he
was
trembling
with
the
endeavour
to
control
himself
to
speak
indulgently
do
think
edmund
there
much
real
difference
between
men
and
women
that
is
there
would
be
if
women
had
fair
treatment
much
difference
oh
come
you
are
talking
nonsense
there
as
much
difference
between
their
minds
as
between
their
bodies
they
are
made
for
entirely
different
duties
monica
sighed
that
word
duty
pained
unutterably
widdowson
bent
forward
and
took
her
hand
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
the
gravest
but
softest
rebuke
she
was
giving
entertainment
to
thoughts
that
would
lead
her
who
knew
whither
that
would
undermine
her
happiness
would
end
by
making
both
of
them
miserable
he
besought
her
to
put
all
such
monstrous
speculations
out
of
her
mind
good
little
wife
do
be
guided
by
your
husband
he
is
older
than
you
darling
and
has
seen
so
much
more
of
the
world
have
said
anything
dreadful
dear
my
thoughts
do
come
from
other
people
they
rise
naturally
in
my
own
head
what
do
you
really
want
you
say
you
ca
live
as
we
were
doing
what
change
would
you
make
should
like
to
make
more
friends
and
to
see
them
often
i
want
to
hear
people
talk
and
know
what
is
going
on
round
about
me
and
to
read
a
different
kind
of
books
books
that
would
really
amuse
me
and
give
me
something
i
could
think
about
with
pleasure
life
will
be
a
burden
to
me
before
long
if
i
do
have
more
freedom
i
do
think
there
any
harm
in
saying
that
he
glared
at
her
shall
begin
to
think
that
you
wish
you
had
never
married
me
should
only
wish
that
if
i
were
made
to
feel
that
you
shut
me
up
in
a
house
and
could
trust
me
to
go
where
i
chose
suppose
the
thought
took
you
that
you
would
go
and
walk
about
the
city
some
afternoon
and
you
wished
to
go
alone
just
to
be
more
at
ease
should
i
have
a
right
to
forbid
you
or
grumble
at
you
and
yet
you
are
very
dissatisfied
if
i
wish
to
go
anywhere
alone
here
the
old
confusion
i
am
a
man
you
are
a
woman
ca
see
that
that
makes
any
difference
a
woman
ought
to
go
about
just
as
freely
as
a
man
i
do
think
it
just
when
i
have
done
my
work
at
home
i
think
i
ought
to
be
every
bit
as
free
as
you
are
every
bit
as
free
and
i
sure
edmund
that
love
needs
freedom
if
it
is
to
remain
love
in
truth
he
looked
at
her
keenly
a
dreadful
thing
for
you
to
say
so
if
i
disapprove
of
your
becoming
the
kind
of
woman
that
acknowledges
no
law
you
will
cease
to
love
me
law
do
you
mean
the
natural
law
that
points
out
a
woman
place
and
he
added
with
shaken
voice
her
to
follow
her
husband
guidance
you
are
angry
we
must
talk
about
it
any
more
just
now
she
rose
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
her
hand
trembled
as
she
drank
widdowson
fell
into
gloomy
abstraction
later
as
they
lay
side
by
side
he
wished
to
renew
the
theme
but
monica
would
not
talk
she
declared
herself
too
sleepy
turned
her
back
to
him
and
soon
slept
indeed
that
night
the
weather
became
stormy
a
roaring
wind
swept
the
channel
and
when
day
broke
nothing
could
be
seen
but
cloud
and
rain
widdowson
who
had
rested
little
was
in
a
heavy
taciturn
mood
monica
on
the
other
hand
talked
gaily
seeming
not
to
observe
her
irresponsiveness
she
was
glad
of
the
wild
sky
now
they
would
see
another
aspect
of
island
life
the
fierce
and
perilous
surges
beating
about
these
granite
shores
they
had
brought
with
them
a
few
books
and
widdowson
after
breakfast
sat
down
by
the
fire
to
read
monica
first
of
all
wrote
a
letter
to
her
sister
then
as
it
was
still
impossible
to
go
out
she
took
up
one
of
the
volumes
that
lay
on
a
in
their
novels
left
by
former
lodgers
her
choice
was
something
or
other
with
yellow
back
widdowson
watching
all
her
movements
furtively
became
aware
of
the
pictured
cover
do
think
you
get
much
good
out
of
that
he
remarked
after
one
or
two
efforts
to
speak
harm
at
all
events
she
replied
not
so
sure
why
should
you
waste
your
time
take
guy
mannering
if
you
want
a
novel
see
how
i
like
this
first
he
felt
himself
powerless
and
suffered
acutely
from
the
thought
that
monica
was
in
rebellion
against
him
he
could
not
understand
what
had
brought
about
this
sudden
change
fear
of
losing
his
wife
love
restrained
him
from
practical
despotism
yet
he
was
very
near
to
uttering
a
definite
command
in
the
afternoon
it
no
longer
rained
and
the
wind
had
less
violence
they
went
out
to
look
at
the
sea
many
people
were
gathered
about
the
harbour
whence
was
a
fine
view
of
the
great
waves
that
broke
into
leaping
foam
and
spray
against
the
crags
of
sark
as
they
stood
thus
occupied
monica
heard
her
name
spoken
in
a
friendly
voice
that
of
cosgrove
have
been
expecting
to
see
you
said
the
lady
arrived
three
days
ago
widdowson
starting
with
surprise
turned
to
examine
the
speaker
he
saw
a
woman
of
something
less
than
middle
age
unfashionably
attired
with
an
air
of
high
spirits
only
when
she
offered
her
hand
to
him
did
he
remember
having
met
her
at
miss
barfoot
to
be
graceful
in
a
high
wind
is
difficult
for
any
man
the
ungainliness
with
which
he
returned
cosgrove
greeting
could
not
have
been
surpassed
and
probably
would
have
been
much
the
same
even
had
he
not
of
necessity
stood
clutching
at
his
felt
hat
the
three
talked
for
a
few
minutes
with
cosgrove
were
two
persons
a
younger
woman
and
a
man
of
about
thirty
the
latter
a
comely
and
vivacious
fellow
with
rather
long
hair
of
the
hue
these
looked
at
monica
but
cosgrove
made
no
introduction
and
see
me
will
you
she
said
mentioning
her
address
ca
get
out
much
in
the
evenings
i
shall
be
nearly
always
at
home
after
dinner
and
we
have
music
of
a
kind
monica
boldly
accepted
the
invitation
said
she
would
be
glad
to
come
then
cosgrove
took
leave
of
them
and
walked
landwards
with
her
companions
widdowson
stood
gazing
at
the
sea
there
was
no
misreading
his
countenance
when
monica
had
remarked
it
she
pressed
her
lips
together
and
waited
for
what
he
would
say
or
do
he
said
nothing
but
presently
turned
his
back
upon
the
waves
and
began
to
walk
on
neither
spoke
until
they
were
in
the
shelter
of
the
streets
then
widdowson
asked
suddenly
that
person
only
know
her
name
and
that
she
goes
to
miss
barfoot
a
most
extraordinary
thing
he
exclaimed
in
high
irritation
no
getting
out
of
the
way
of
those
people
monica
also
was
angry
her
cheeks
reddened
by
the
wind
grew
hotter
still
more
extraordinary
that
you
should
object
so
to
them
or
no
i
object
and
i
had
rather
you
did
go
to
see
that
woman
are
unreasonable
monica
answered
sharply
i
shall
go
and
see
her
forbid
you
to
do
so
if
you
go
it
will
be
in
defiance
of
my
wish
i
am
obliged
to
defy
your
wish
i
shall
certainly
go
his
face
was
frightfully
distorted
had
they
been
in
a
lonely
spot
monica
would
have
felt
afraid
of
him
she
moved
hurriedly
away
in
the
direction
of
their
lodgings
and
for
a
few
paces
he
followed
then
he
checked
himself
turned
round
about
took
an
opposite
way
with
strides
of
rage
he
went
along
by
the
quay
past
the
hotels
and
the
smaller
houses
that
follow
on
to
sampson
the
wind
again
preparing
for
a
tempestuous
night
beat
and
shook
and
at
moments
all
but
stopped
him
he
set
his
teeth
like
a
madman
and
raged
on
past
the
granite
quarries
at
bordeaux
harbour
then
towards
the
wild
north
extremity
of
the
island
the
sandy
waste
of
when
darkness
began
to
fall
no
human
being
was
in
his
range
of
sight
he
stood
on
one
spot
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
watching
or
appearing
to
watch
the
black
scud
their
time
for
dining
was
seven
shortly
before
this
widdowson
entered
the
house
and
went
to
the
monica
was
not
there
he
found
her
in
the
before
the
at
the
sight
of
his
reflected
face
she
turned
instantly
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
whispering
hoarsely
do
you
love
me
she
looked
away
not
replying
and
of
a
sudden
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
clasped
her
about
the
waist
burst
into
choking
sobs
you
no
love
for
me
my
darling
my
dear
beautiful
wife
have
you
begun
to
hate
me
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
implored
him
to
rise
and
command
himself
was
so
violent
so
brutal
with
you
i
spoke
without
thinking
should
you
speak
like
that
why
are
you
so
unreasonable
if
you
forbid
me
to
do
simple
things
with
not
the
least
harm
in
them
you
ca
expect
me
to
take
it
like
a
child
i
shall
resist
i
ca
help
it
he
had
risen
and
was
crushing
her
in
his
arms
his
hot
breath
on
her
neck
when
he
began
to
whisper
want
to
keep
you
all
to
myself
i
do
like
these
people
they
think
so
differently
they
put
such
hateful
ideas
into
your
mind
they
are
not
the
right
kind
of
friends
for
you
misunderstand
them
and
you
do
in
the
least
understand
me
oh
you
hurt
me
edmund
he
released
her
body
and
took
her
head
between
his
hands
had
rather
you
were
dead
than
that
you
should
cease
to
love
me
you
shall
go
to
see
her
i
wo
say
a
word
against
it
but
monica
be
faithful
be
faithful
to
me
to
you
she
echoed
in
astonishment
have
i
said
or
done
to
put
you
in
such
a
state
because
i
wish
to
make
a
few
friends
as
all
women
do
because
i
have
lived
so
much
alone
i
have
never
had
more
than
one
or
two
friends
and
i
am
absurdly
jealous
when
you
want
to
get
away
from
me
and
amuse
yourself
with
strangers
i
ca
talk
to
such
people
i
am
not
suited
for
society
if
i
had
met
you
in
that
strange
way
by
miracle
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
marry
if
i
allow
you
to
have
these
friends
do
like
to
hear
that
word
why
should
you
say
do
you
think
of
me
as
your
servant
edmund
know
how
i
think
of
you
it
is
i
who
am
your
servant
your
slave
i
ca
believe
that
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
cheeks
and
laughed
unnaturally
words
do
mean
anything
it
is
you
who
forbid
and
allow
and
command
and
will
never
again
use
such
words
only
convince
me
that
you
love
me
as
much
as
ever
is
so
miserable
to
begin
quarrelling
again
say
you
love
me
put
your
arms
round
my
neck
press
closer
to
me
she
kissed
his
cheek
but
did
not
utter
a
word
ca
say
that
you
love
me
think
i
am
always
showing
it
do
get
ready
for
dinner
now
it
past
seven
oh
how
foolish
you
have
been
of
course
their
talk
lasted
half
through
the
night
monica
held
with
remarkable
firmness
to
the
position
she
had
taken
a
much
older
woman
might
have
envied
her
steadfast
yet
quite
rational
assertion
of
the
right
to
live
a
life
of
her
own
apart
from
that
imposed
upon
her
by
the
duties
of
wedlock
a
great
deal
of
this
spirit
and
the
utterance
it
found
was
traceable
to
her
association
with
the
women
whom
widdowson
so
deeply
suspected
prior
to
her
sojourn
in
rutland
street
she
could
not
even
have
made
clear
to
herself
the
demands
which
she
now
very
clearly
formulated
believing
that
she
had
learnt
nothing
from
them
and
till
of
late
instinctively
opposing
the
doctrines
held
by
miss
barfoot
and
rhoda
nunn
monica
in
truth
owed
the
sole
bit
of
real
education
she
had
ever
received
to
those
few
weeks
of
attendance
in
great
portland
street
circumstances
were
now
proving
how
apt
a
pupil
she
had
been
even
against
her
will
marriage
as
is
always
the
case
with
women
capable
of
development
made
for
her
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
perhaps
on
no
single
subject
did
she
now
think
as
on
the
morning
of
her
must
either
trust
me
completely
she
said
not
at
all
if
you
ca
and
wo
trust
me
how
can
i
possibly
love
you
i
never
to
advise
asked
her
husband
baffled
and
even
awed
by
this
extraordinary
revelation
of
a
woman
he
had
supposed
himself
to
know
thoroughly
that
a
very
different
thing
from
forbidding
and
commanding
she
laughed
was
that
novel
this
morning
of
course
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
guy
mannering
is
better
but
that
does
say
i
am
not
to
form
my
opinion
of
other
books
you
must
be
afraid
to
leave
me
the
same
freedom
you
have
yourself
the
result
of
it
all
was
that
widdowson
felt
his
passionate
love
glow
with
new
fire
for
a
moment
he
thought
himself
capable
of
accepting
this
change
in
their
relations
the
marvellous
thought
of
equality
between
man
and
wife
that
gospel
which
in
days
will
refashion
the
world
for
an
instant
smote
his
imagination
and
exalted
him
above
his
native
level
monica
paid
for
the
energy
she
had
put
forth
by
a
day
of
suffering
her
head
ached
intolerably
she
had
feverish
symptoms
and
could
hardly
raise
herself
from
the
bed
it
passed
and
she
was
once
more
eager
to
go
forth
under
the
blue
sky
that
followed
the
tempest
you
go
with
me
to
cosgrove
this
evening
she
asked
of
her
husband
he
consented
and
after
dinner
they
sought
the
hotel
where
their
acquaintance
was
staying
widdowson
was
in
extreme
discomfort
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
no
dress
clothes
to
put
on
for
far
from
anticipating
or
desiring
any
such
intercourse
in
guernsey
he
had
never
thought
of
packing
an
evening
suit
had
he
known
cosgrove
this
uneasiness
would
have
been
spared
him
that
lady
was
in
revolt
against
far
graver
institutions
than
the
she
cared
not
a
button
in
what
garb
her
visitors
came
to
her
on
their
arrival
they
found
to
widdowson
horror
a
room
full
of
women
with
the
hostess
was
that
younger
lady
they
had
seen
on
the
quay
cosgrove
unmarried
sister
miss
knott
health
had
demanded
this
retreat
from
the
london
winter
the
guests
were
four
a
bevis
and
her
three
daughters
all
invalidish
persons
the
mother
somewhat
lackadaisical
the
girls
with
a
look
of
unwilling
spinsterhood
monica
noteworthy
among
the
gathering
for
her
sweet
bright
prettiness
and
the
finish
of
her
dress
soon
made
herself
at
home
she
chatted
gaily
with
the
girls
wondering
indeed
at
her
own
air
of
maturity
which
came
to
her
for
the
first
time
cosgrove
an
easy
woman
of
the
world
when
circumstances
required
it
did
her
best
to
get
something
out
of
widdowson
who
presently
thawed
a
little
then
miss
knott
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
played
more
than
tolerably
well
and
the
youngest
miss
bevis
sang
a
song
of
schubert
with
passable
voice
but
in
very
distressing
german
the
sole
person
distressed
by
it
being
the
hostess
meanwhile
monica
had
been
captured
by
bevis
who
discoursed
to
her
on
a
subject
painfully
familiar
to
all
the
old
lady
friends
you
know
my
son
widdowson
oh
i
thought
you
had
perhaps
met
him
you
will
do
so
this
evening
i
hope
he
is
over
here
on
a
fortnight
holiday
you
live
in
guernsey
monica
inquired
practically
live
here
and
one
of
my
daughters
is
always
with
me
the
other
two
live
with
their
brother
in
a
flat
in
bayswater
do
you
care
for
flats
mrs
widdowson
monica
could
only
say
that
she
had
no
experience
of
that
institution
do
think
them
such
a
boon
pursued
bevis
are
expensive
but
the
advantages
and
comforts
are
so
many
my
son
would
on
any
consideration
give
up
his
flat
as
i
was
saying
he
always
has
two
of
his
sisters
to
keep
house
for
him
he
is
quite
a
young
man
not
yet
thirty
but
would
you
believe
it
we
are
all
dependent
upon
him
my
son
has
supported
the
of
the
family
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
and
that
by
his
own
work
it
sounds
incredible
does
it
but
for
him
we
should
be
quite
unable
to
live
the
dear
girls
have
very
delicate
health
simply
impossible
for
them
to
exert
themselves
in
any
way
my
son
has
made
extraordinary
sacrifices
on
our
account
his
desire
was
to
be
a
professional
musician
and
every
one
thinks
he
would
have
become
eminent
myself
i
am
convinced
of
it
perhaps
that
is
only
natural
but
when
our
circumstances
began
to
grow
very
doubtful
and
we
really
did
know
what
was
before
us
my
son
consented
to
follow
a
business
career
that
of
wine
merchant
with
which
his
father
was
connected
and
he
exerted
himself
so
nobly
and
gave
proof
of
such
ability
that
very
soon
all
our
fears
were
at
an
end
and
now
before
he
is
thirty
his
position
is
quite
assured
we
have
no
longer
a
care
i
live
here
very
economically
really
sweet
lodgings
on
the
road
to
martin
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
me
and
the
girls
go
backwards
and
forwards
you
see
we
are
here
at
present
when
my
son
returns
to
london
he
will
take
the
eldest
and
the
youngest
with
him
the
middle
girl
dear
grace
she
is
thought
very
clever
in
and
i
am
quite
sure
if
it
were
necessary
she
could
pursue
the
arts
in
a
professional
spirit
bevis
entered
the
room
and
monica
recognized
the
sprightly
young
man
whom
she
had
seen
on
the
quay
the
hostess
presented
him
to
her
new
friends
and
he
got
into
talk
with
widdowson
requested
to
make
music
for
the
company
he
sang
a
gay
little
piece
which
to
monica
at
all
events
seemed
one
of
the
most
delightful
things
she
had
ever
heard
own
composition
whispered
miss
grace
bevis
then
sitting
by
widdowson
that
increased
her
delight
foolish
as
bevis
undoubtedly
was
she
perchance
had
not
praised
her
son
beyond
his
merits
he
looked
the
best
of
good
fellows
so
kind
and
merry
and
spirited
such
a
capable
man
too
it
struck
monica
as
a
very
hard
fate
that
he
should
have
this
family
on
his
hands
what
they
must
cost
him
probably
he
could
not
think
of
marrying
just
on
their
account
bevis
came
and
took
a
place
by
her
side
you
so
very
much
she
said
that
charming
song
is
it
published
dear
no
he
laughed
and
shook
his
thick
hair
about
one
of
two
or
three
that
i
somehow
struck
out
when
i
was
studying
in
germany
ages
ago
you
play
i
hope
monica
gave
a
sad
negative
what
does
it
matter
there
are
hosts
of
people
who
will
always
be
overjoyed
to
play
when
you
ask
them
it
would
be
a
capital
thing
if
only
those
children
were
allowed
to
learn
an
instrument
who
showed
genuine
talent
for
music
that
case
said
monica
certainly
would
be
hosts
of
people
ready
to
play
for
me
his
merry
laugh
was
repeated
must
mind
when
i
contradict
myself
it
one
of
my
habits
are
you
here
for
the
whole
winter
a
few
weeks
unfortunately
do
you
dread
the
voyage
back
tell
the
truth
i
do
i
had
a
very
unpleasant
time
coming
for
myself
how
i
ever
undertake
the
thing
i
really
do
know
one
of
these
times
i
shall
die
there
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
of
that
the
girls
always
have
to
carry
me
ashore
one
holding
me
by
the
hair
and
one
by
the
boots
happily
i
am
so
emaciated
that
my
weight
distress
them
i
pick
up
flesh
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
my
health
is
stupendous
as
at
present
you
see
how
marvellously
i
look
you
look
very
well
replied
monica
glancing
at
the
fair
comely
face
deceptive
all
our
family
have
wretched
constitutions
if
i
go
to
work
regularly
for
a
couple
of
months
without
a
holiday
i
sink
into
absolute
decrepitude
an
has
been
specially
made
for
me
to
hold
me
up
at
the
i
beg
your
pardon
for
this
clowning
widdowson
he
suddenly
added
in
another
voice
air
puts
me
in
such
spirits
what
air
it
is
speaking
quite
seriously
my
mother
was
saved
by
coming
to
live
here
we
believed
her
to
be
dying
and
now
i
have
hopes
that
she
will
live
ever
so
many
years
longer
he
spoke
of
his
mother
with
evident
affection
glancing
kindly
towards
her
with
his
blue
eyes
only
once
or
twice
had
monica
ventured
to
exchange
a
glance
with
her
husband
it
satisfied
her
that
he
managed
to
converse
what
his
mood
really
was
could
not
be
determined
until
afterwards
when
they
were
about
to
leave
she
saw
him
to
her
surprise
speaking
quite
pleasantly
with
bevis
a
carriage
was
procured
to
convey
them
home
and
as
soon
as
they
had
started
monica
asked
her
husband
with
a
merry
look
how
he
had
enjoyed
himself
is
not
much
harm
in
it
he
replied
dryly
how
like
you
edmund
to
put
it
that
way
now
confess
you
will
be
glad
to
go
again
shall
go
if
you
wish
man
you
ca
bring
yourself
to
admit
that
it
was
pleasant
to
be
among
new
people
i
believe
in
your
heart
you
think
all
enjoyment
is
wrong
the
music
was
nice
was
it
did
think
much
of
the
girl
singing
but
that
fellow
bevis
was
bad
monica
examined
him
as
he
spoke
and
seemed
to
suppress
a
laugh
he
was
at
all
bad
i
saw
you
talking
with
bevis
did
she
tell
you
anything
about
her
wonderful
son
particular
then
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
story
and
she
did
so
in
a
tone
half
of
jest
half
of
serious
approval
do
see
that
he
has
done
anything
more
than
his
duty
remarked
widdowson
at
the
end
he
is
a
bad
fellow
for
private
reasons
monica
contrasted
this
attitude
towards
bevis
with
the
disfavour
her
husband
had
shown
to
barfoot
and
was
secretly
much
amused
two
or
three
days
after
they
went
to
spend
the
morning
at
petit
bot
bay
and
there
encountered
with
bevis
and
his
three
sisters
the
result
was
an
invitation
to
go
back
and
have
lunch
at
bevis
lodgings
they
accepted
it
and
remained
with
their
acquaintances
till
dusk
the
young
man
holiday
was
at
an
end
next
morning
he
would
face
the
voyage
which
he
had
depicted
so
grotesquely
alone
he
lamented
to
monica
think
of
it
the
girls
are
all
rather
below
par
just
now
they
had
better
stay
here
for
the
present
in
london
you
will
be
alone
too
it
very
sad
i
must
bear
up
under
it
the
worst
of
it
is
i
am
naturally
subject
to
depression
in
solitude
i
sink
sink
but
the
subject
is
too
painful
do
let
us
darken
the
last
hours
with
such
reflections
widdowson
retained
his
indulgent
opinion
of
the
facetious
young
wine
merchant
he
even
laughed
now
and
then
in
recalling
some
phrase
or
other
that
bevis
had
used
to
him
subsequently
monica
had
several
long
conversations
with
the
old
lady
impelled
to
gossipy
frankness
about
all
her
affairs
bevis
allowed
it
to
be
understood
that
the
chief
reason
for
two
of
the
girls
always
being
with
their
brother
was
the
possibility
thus
afforded
of
their
people
that
is
to
say
of
their
having
a
chance
of
marriage
cosgrove
and
one
or
two
other
ladies
did
them
social
service
never
marry
said
monica
to
her
husband
rather
thoughtfully
than
with
commiseration
not
they
are
nice
enough
girls
but
they
have
no
money
and
she
smiled
see
that
they
want
to
find
husbands
do
see
that
the
first
matters
and
the
second
is
only
natural
monica
attempted
no
rejoinder
but
said
presently
they
are
just
the
kind
of
women
who
ought
to
find
something
to
do
to
do
why
they
attend
to
their
mother
and
their
brother
what
could
be
more
proper
proper
perhaps
but
they
are
miserable
and
always
will
be
they
have
no
to
be
miserable
they
are
doing
their
duty
and
that
ought
to
keep
them
cheerful
monica
could
have
said
many
things
but
she
overcame
the
desire
and
laughed
the
subject
aside
chapter
xvii
the
triumph
nor
till
did
barfoot
again
see
his
friends
the
micklethwaites
by
invitation
he
went
to
south
tottenham
on
new
eve
and
dined
with
them
at
seven
he
was
the
first
guest
that
had
entered
the
house
since
their
marriage
from
the
very
doorstep
everard
became
conscious
of
a
domestic
atmosphere
that
told
soothingly
upon
his
nerves
the
little
servant
who
opened
to
him
exhibited
a
gentle
noiseless
demeanour
which
was
no
doubt
the
result
of
careful
discipline
micklethwaite
himself
who
at
once
came
out
into
the
passage
gave
proof
of
a
like
influence
his
hearty
greeting
was
spoken
in
soft
tones
a
placid
happiness
beamed
from
his
face
in
the
micklethwaite
study
used
for
reception
because
the
other
had
to
serve
as
tempered
lamplight
and
the
glow
of
a
hospitable
fire
showed
the
hostess
and
her
blind
sister
standing
in
expectation
to
everard
eyes
both
of
them
looked
far
better
in
health
than
a
few
months
ago
micklethwaite
was
no
longer
so
distressingly
old
an
expression
that
resembled
girlish
pleasure
lit
up
her
countenance
as
she
stepped
forward
nay
if
he
mistook
not
there
came
a
gentle
warmth
to
her
cheek
and
the
momentary
downward
glance
was
as
graceful
and
modest
as
in
a
youthful
bride
never
had
barfoot
approached
a
woman
with
more
finished
courtesy
the
sincere
expression
of
his
feeling
the
blind
sister
he
regarded
in
like
spirit
his
voice
touched
its
softest
note
as
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
and
replied
to
her
pleasant
words
no
undue
indication
of
poverty
disturbed
him
he
saw
that
the
house
had
been
improved
in
many
ways
since
micklethwaite
had
taken
possession
of
it
pictures
ornaments
pieces
of
furniture
were
added
all
in
simple
taste
but
serving
to
heighten
the
effect
of
refined
comfort
where
the
average
woman
would
have
displayed
pretentious
emptiness
micklethwaite
had
made
a
home
which
in
its
way
was
beautiful
the
dinner
which
she
herself
had
cooked
and
which
she
assisted
in
serving
aimed
at
being
no
more
than
a
simple
decorous
meal
but
the
guest
unfeignedly
enjoyed
it
even
the
vegetables
and
the
bread
seemed
to
him
to
have
a
daintier
flavour
than
at
many
a
rich
table
he
could
not
help
noticing
and
admiring
the
skill
with
which
miss
wheatley
ate
without
seeing
what
was
before
her
had
he
not
known
her
misfortune
he
would
hardly
have
become
aware
of
it
by
any
peculiarity
as
she
sat
opposite
to
him
the
mathematician
had
learnt
to
sit
upon
a
chair
like
ordinary
mortals
for
the
first
week
or
two
it
must
have
cost
him
severe
restraint
now
he
betrayed
no
temptation
to
roll
and
jerk
and
twist
himself
when
the
ladies
retired
he
reached
from
the
sideboard
a
box
which
barfoot
viewed
with
uneasiness
you
smoke
here
in
this
room
why
not
everard
glanced
at
the
pretty
curtains
before
the
windows
my
boy
you
do
smoke
here
and
in
fact
i
like
your
claret
i
wo
spoil
the
flavour
of
it
you
please
but
i
think
fanny
will
be
distressed
shall
say
that
i
have
abandoned
the
weed
emotions
were
at
conflict
in
micklethwaite
mind
but
finally
he
beamed
with
gratitude
he
bent
forward
and
touched
his
friend
arm
are
angels
walking
the
earth
in
this
our
day
science
has
abolished
them
my
dear
fellow
and
i
do
think
it
ever
will
falls
to
the
lot
of
but
few
men
to
encounter
them
and
of
fewer
still
to
entertain
them
permanently
in
a
cottage
at
south
tottenham
are
right
micklethwaite
laughed
in
a
new
way
with
scarcely
any
sound
a
change
everard
had
already
noticed
two
sisters
but
i
had
better
not
speak
about
them
in
my
old
age
i
have
become
a
worshipper
a
mystic
a
man
of
dream
and
vision
about
worship
in
a
parochial
sense
inquired
barfoot
smiling
difficulty
of
that
point
conform
in
moderation
nothing
would
be
asked
of
me
there
is
no
fanaticism
no
intolerance
it
would
be
brutal
if
i
declined
to
go
to
church
on
a
sunday
morning
you
see
my
strictly
scientific
attitude
helps
in
avoiding
offence
fanny
ca
understand
it
but
my
lack
of
dogmatism
vastly
relieves
her
i
have
been
trying
to
explain
to
her
that
the
scientific
mind
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
materialism
the
new
order
of
ideas
is
of
course
very
difficult
for
her
to
grasp
but
in
time
in
time
heaven
sake
do
attempt
conversion
no
account
whatever
but
i
like
her
to
see
what
is
meant
by
perception
and
conception
by
the
relativity
of
time
and
space
and
a
few
simple
things
of
that
kind
barfoot
laughed
heartily
he
said
shifting
to
safer
ground
brother
tom
is
in
london
and
in
wretched
health
angel
is
from
the
wrong
quarter
from
the
nethermost
pit
i
seriously
believe
that
she
has
a
plan
for
killing
her
husband
you
remember
my
mentioning
in
a
letter
his
he
has
never
recovered
from
that
and
as
likely
as
not
never
will
his
wife
brought
him
away
from
madeira
just
when
he
ought
to
have
stopped
there
to
get
well
he
settled
himself
at
torquay
whilst
that
woman
ran
about
to
pay
visits
it
was
understood
that
she
should
go
back
to
him
at
torquay
but
this
she
at
length
refused
to
do
the
place
was
too
dull
it
did
suit
her
extremely
delicate
health
she
must
live
in
london
her
pure
native
air
if
tom
had
taken
any
advice
he
would
have
let
her
live
just
where
she
pleased
thanking
heaven
that
she
was
at
a
distance
from
him
but
the
poor
fellow
be
away
from
her
he
has
come
up
and
here
i
feel
convinced
he
will
die
it
a
very
monstrous
thing
but
uncommonly
like
women
in
general
who
have
got
a
man
into
their
power
micklethwaite
shook
his
head
are
too
hard
upon
them
you
have
been
unlucky
you
know
my
view
of
your
duty
begin
to
think
that
marriage
is
impossible
for
me
said
barfoot
with
a
grave
smile
capital
as
likely
as
not
it
will
be
marriage
without
forms
simply
a
free
union
the
mathematician
was
downcast
sorry
to
hear
that
it
wo
do
we
must
conform
besides
in
that
case
the
person
decidedly
is
suitable
to
you
you
of
all
men
must
marry
a
lady
should
never
think
of
any
one
that
was
a
lady
emancipation
getting
as
far
as
that
do
ladies
enter
into
that
kind
of
union
do
know
of
any
example
that
just
why
the
idea
tempts
me
barfoot
would
go
no
further
in
explanation
about
your
new
algebra
my
dear
boy
the
temptation
is
so
frightful
when
i
get
back
home
remember
that
i
have
never
known
what
it
was
to
sit
and
talk
through
the
evening
with
ordinary
friends
let
alone
it
too
much
for
me
just
yet
and
you
know
i
do
venture
to
work
on
sundays
that
will
come
all
in
good
time
i
must
grant
myself
half
a
year
of
luxury
after
such
a
life
as
mine
has
been
course
you
must
let
algebra
wait
think
it
over
of
course
at
odd
moments
church
on
sunday
morning
is
a
good
opportunity
barfoot
could
not
stay
to
see
the
old
year
out
but
good
wishes
were
none
the
less
heartily
exchanged
before
he
went
micklethwaite
walked
with
him
to
the
railway
station
at
a
few
paces
distance
from
his
house
he
stood
and
pointed
back
to
it
little
place
barfoot
is
one
of
the
sacred
spots
of
the
earth
strange
to
think
that
the
house
has
been
waiting
for
me
there
through
all
the
years
of
my
hopelessness
i
feel
that
a
mysterious
light
ought
to
shine
about
it
it
ought
to
look
just
like
common
houses
on
his
way
home
everard
thought
over
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
smiling
well
that
was
one
ideal
of
marriage
not
ideal
but
very
beautiful
amid
the
vulgarities
and
vileness
of
ordinary
experience
it
was
the
old
fashion
in
its
purest
presentment
the
consecrated
form
of
domestic
happiness
removed
beyond
reach
of
satire
only
to
be
touched
if
touched
at
all
with
the
very
gentlest
irony
a
life
by
no
means
for
him
if
he
tried
it
even
with
a
woman
so
perfect
he
would
perish
of
for
him
marriage
must
not
mean
repose
inevitably
tending
to
drowsiness
but
the
mutual
incitement
of
vigorous
minds
passion
yes
there
must
be
passion
at
all
events
to
begin
with
passion
not
impossible
of
revival
in
days
subsequent
to
its
first
indulgence
beauty
in
the
academic
sense
he
no
longer
demanded
enough
that
the
face
spoke
eloquently
that
the
limbs
were
vigorous
let
beauty
perish
if
it
can
not
ally
itself
with
mind
be
a
woman
what
else
she
may
let
her
have
brains
and
the
power
of
using
them
in
that
demand
the
maturity
of
his
manhood
expressed
itself
for
casual
amour
the
odalisque
could
still
prevail
with
him
but
for
the
life
of
wedlock
the
durable
companionship
of
man
and
woman
intellect
was
his
first
requirement
a
woman
with
man
capability
of
understanding
and
reasoning
free
from
superstition
religious
or
social
far
above
the
ignoble
weaknesses
which
men
have
been
base
enough
to
idealize
in
her
sex
a
woman
who
would
scorn
the
vulgarism
of
jealousy
and
yet
know
what
it
is
to
love
this
was
asking
much
of
nature
and
civilization
did
he
grossly
deceive
himself
in
thinking
he
had
found
the
paragon
for
thus
far
had
he
advanced
in
his
thoughts
of
rhoda
nunn
if
the
phrase
had
any
meaning
he
was
in
love
with
her
yet
strange
complex
of
emotions
he
was
still
only
half
serious
in
his
desire
to
take
her
for
a
wife
wishing
rather
to
amuse
and
flatter
himself
by
merely
inspiring
her
with
passion
therefore
he
refused
to
entertain
a
thought
of
formal
marriage
to
obtain
her
consent
to
marriage
would
mean
nothing
at
all
it
would
afford
him
no
satisfaction
but
so
to
play
upon
her
emotions
that
the
proud
intellectual
earnest
woman
was
willing
to
defy
society
for
his
sake
ah
that
would
be
an
end
worth
achieving
ever
since
the
dialogue
in
which
he
frankly
explained
his
position
and
all
but
declared
love
he
had
not
once
seen
rhoda
in
private
she
shunned
him
purposely
beyond
a
doubt
and
did
not
that
denote
a
fear
of
him
justified
by
her
inclination
the
postponement
of
what
must
necessarily
come
to
pass
between
them
began
to
try
his
patience
as
assuredly
it
inflamed
his
ardour
if
no
other
resource
offered
he
would
be
obliged
to
make
his
cousin
an
accomplice
by
requesting
her
beforehand
to
leave
him
alone
with
rhoda
some
evening
when
he
had
called
upon
them
but
it
was
time
that
chance
favoured
him
and
his
interview
with
miss
nunn
came
about
in
a
way
he
could
not
have
foreseen
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
january
he
was
invited
to
dine
at
miss
barfoot
the
afternoon
had
been
foggy
and
when
he
set
forth
there
seemed
to
be
some
likelihood
of
a
plague
of
choking
darkness
such
as
would
obstruct
traffic
as
usual
he
went
by
train
to
sloane
square
purposing
for
it
was
dry
under
foot
and
he
could
not
disregard
small
economies
to
walk
the
short
distance
from
there
to
queen
road
on
coming
out
from
the
station
he
found
the
fog
so
dense
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
could
reach
his
journey
end
cabs
were
not
to
be
had
he
must
either
explore
the
gloom
with
risk
of
getting
nowhere
at
all
or
give
it
up
and
take
a
train
back
but
he
longed
too
ardently
for
the
sight
of
rhoda
to
abandon
his
evening
without
an
effort
having
with
difficulty
made
his
way
into
king
road
he
found
progress
easier
on
account
of
the
shop
illuminations
the
fog
however
was
growing
every
moment
more
fearsome
and
when
he
had
to
turn
out
of
the
highway
his
case
appeared
desperate
literally
he
groped
along
feeling
the
fronts
of
the
houses
as
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
had
only
just
time
enough
to
reach
his
cousin
punctually
he
must
be
very
late
perhaps
they
would
conclude
that
he
had
not
ventured
out
on
such
a
night
and
were
already
dining
without
him
no
matter
as
well
go
one
way
as
another
now
after
abandoning
hope
several
times
and
all
but
asphyxiated
he
found
by
inquiry
of
a
man
with
whom
he
collided
that
he
was
actually
within
a
few
doors
of
his
destination
another
effort
and
he
rang
a
joyous
peal
at
the
bell
a
mistake
it
was
the
wrong
house
and
he
had
to
go
two
doors
farther
on
this
time
he
procured
admittance
to
the
familiar
little
hall
the
servant
smiled
at
him
but
said
nothing
he
was
led
to
the
and
there
found
rhoda
nunn
alone
this
fact
did
not
so
much
surprise
him
as
rhoda
appearance
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
her
dress
was
not
uniform
black
she
wore
a
red
silk
blouse
with
a
black
skirt
and
so
admirable
was
the
effect
of
this
costume
that
he
scarcely
refrained
from
a
delighted
exclamation
some
concern
was
visible
in
her
face
am
sorry
to
say
were
her
first
words
miss
barfoot
will
not
be
here
in
time
for
dinner
she
went
to
faversham
this
morning
and
ought
to
have
been
back
about
seven
but
a
telegram
came
some
time
ago
a
thick
fog
caused
her
to
miss
the
train
and
the
next
does
reach
victoria
till
ten
minutes
past
ten
it
was
now
eight
dinner
had
been
appointed
for
the
hour
barfoot
explained
his
lateness
in
arriving
it
so
bad
as
that
i
did
know
the
situation
embarrassed
both
of
them
barfoot
suspected
a
hope
on
miss
nunn
part
that
he
would
relieve
her
of
his
company
but
even
had
there
been
no
external
hindrance
he
could
not
have
relinquished
the
happy
occasion
to
use
frankness
was
best
of
the
question
for
me
to
leave
the
house
he
said
meeting
her
eyes
and
smiling
wo
be
hard
upon
a
starving
man
at
once
rhoda
made
a
pretence
of
having
felt
no
hesitation
of
course
we
will
dine
immediately
she
rang
the
bell
barfoot
took
it
for
granted
that
i
would
represent
her
look
the
fog
is
penetrating
even
to
our
fireside
very
what
is
mary
doing
at
faversham
one
she
has
been
corresponding
with
for
some
time
begged
her
to
go
down
and
give
an
address
to
a
number
of
ladies
on
a
certain
subject
mary
is
on
the
way
to
become
a
celebrity
against
her
will
as
you
know
they
went
to
dinner
and
barfoot
thoroughly
enjoying
the
abnormal
state
of
things
continued
to
talk
of
his
cousin
seems
to
me
that
she
ca
logically
refuse
to
put
herself
forward
work
of
her
kind
ca
be
done
in
a
corner
it
is
a
case
of
oh
teach
the
orphan
girl
to
sew
have
used
the
same
argument
to
her
said
rhoda
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
its
full
effect
upon
imagination
why
should
he
hold
by
a
resolve
of
which
he
did
not
absolutely
approve
the
motive
why
not
ask
her
simply
to
be
his
wife
and
so
remove
one
element
of
difficulty
from
his
pursuit
true
he
was
wretchedly
poor
marrying
on
such
an
income
he
would
at
once
find
his
freedom
restricted
in
every
direction
but
then
more
likely
than
not
rhoda
had
determined
against
marriage
and
of
him
especially
never
thought
for
a
moment
as
a
possible
husband
well
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
ascertain
they
conversed
naturally
enough
till
the
meal
was
over
then
their
embarrassment
revived
but
this
time
it
was
rhoda
who
took
the
initiative
i
leave
you
to
your
meditations
she
asked
moving
a
few
inches
from
the
table
should
much
prefer
your
society
if
you
will
grant
it
me
for
a
little
longer
without
speaking
she
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
there
sitting
at
a
formal
distance
from
each
other
they
talked
of
the
fog
would
miss
barfoot
be
able
to
get
back
at
all
said
everard
you
ever
read
the
city
of
dreadful
night
i
have
read
it
sympathy
of
course
of
course
do
i
seem
to
you
a
shallow
optimist
a
vigorous
and
rational
optimist
such
as
i
myself
aim
at
being
you
but
optimism
of
that
kind
must
be
proved
by
some
effort
on
behalf
of
society
the
effort
i
am
making
if
a
man
works
at
developing
and
fortifying
the
best
things
in
his
own
character
he
is
surely
doing
society
a
service
she
smiled
sceptically
no
doubt
but
how
do
you
develop
and
fortify
yourself
she
was
meeting
him
thought
everard
foreseeing
the
inevitable
she
wished
to
have
it
over
and
done
with
or
else
live
very
quietly
was
his
reply
of
grave
problems
most
of
my
time
you
know
i
am
a
great
deal
alone
anything
but
naturally
rhoda
said
nothing
he
waited
a
moment
then
moved
to
a
seat
much
nearer
hers
her
face
hardened
and
he
saw
her
fingers
lock
together
a
man
is
in
love
solitude
seems
to
him
the
most
unnatural
of
conditions
do
make
me
your
confidante
barfoot
rhoda
with
pleasantry
have
no
taste
for
that
kind
of
thing
i
ca
help
doing
so
it
is
you
that
i
am
in
love
with
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
happily
the
sentiment
will
not
long
trouble
you
he
read
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
a
profound
agitation
she
glanced
about
the
room
and
before
he
could
again
speak
had
risen
to
ring
the
bell
always
take
coffee
i
think
without
troubling
to
give
any
assent
he
moved
apart
and
turned
over
some
books
on
the
table
for
full
five
minutes
there
was
silence
the
coffee
was
brought
he
tasted
it
and
put
his
cup
down
seeing
that
rhoda
had
as
it
were
entrenched
herself
behind
the
beverage
and
would
continue
to
sip
at
it
as
long
as
might
be
necessary
he
went
and
stood
in
front
of
her
nunn
i
am
more
serious
than
you
will
give
me
credit
for
being
the
sentiment
as
you
call
it
has
troubled
me
for
some
time
and
will
last
her
refuge
failed
her
the
cup
she
was
holding
began
to
shake
a
little
let
me
put
it
aside
for
you
rhoda
allowed
him
to
do
so
and
then
locked
her
fingers
am
so
much
in
love
with
you
that
i
ca
keep
away
from
this
house
more
than
a
few
days
at
a
time
of
course
you
have
known
it
i
tried
to
disguise
why
i
came
here
so
often
it
so
seldom
that
i
see
you
alone
and
now
that
fortune
is
kind
to
me
i
must
speak
as
best
i
can
i
wo
make
myself
ridiculous
in
your
eyes
if
i
can
help
it
you
despise
the
of
ballrooms
and
garden
parties
so
do
i
most
heartily
let
me
speak
like
a
man
who
has
few
illusions
to
overcome
i
want
you
for
the
companion
of
my
life
i
do
see
very
well
how
i
am
to
do
without
you
you
know
i
think
that
i
have
only
a
moderate
competence
it
enough
to
live
upon
without
miseries
that
all
one
can
say
probably
i
shall
never
be
richer
for
i
ca
promise
to
exert
myself
to
earn
money
i
wish
to
live
for
other
things
you
can
picture
the
kind
of
life
i
want
you
to
share
you
know
me
well
enough
to
understand
that
my
wife
if
we
use
the
old
word
would
be
as
free
to
live
in
her
own
way
as
i
to
live
in
mine
all
the
same
it
is
love
that
i
am
asking
for
think
how
you
may
about
man
and
woman
you
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
between
them
and
that
the
love
of
a
man
and
a
woman
who
can
think
intelligently
may
be
the
best
thing
life
has
to
offer
them
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
but
she
was
smiling
in
a
forced
way
with
her
lips
close
set
you
insisted
on
speaking
she
said
at
length
had
no
choice
but
to
listen
it
is
usual
i
think
if
one
may
trust
the
novels
for
a
woman
to
return
thanks
when
an
offer
of
this
kind
has
been
made
to
her
so
thank
you
very
much
mr
barfoot
everard
seized
a
little
chair
that
was
close
by
planted
it
beside
rhoda
there
seated
himself
and
took
possession
of
one
of
her
hands
it
was
done
so
rapidly
and
vehemently
that
rhoda
started
back
her
expression
changing
from
sportive
mockery
to
all
but
alarm
will
have
no
such
thanks
he
uttered
in
a
low
voice
much
moved
a
smile
making
him
look
strangely
stern
shall
understand
what
it
means
when
a
man
says
that
he
loves
you
i
have
come
to
think
your
face
so
beautiful
that
i
am
in
torment
with
the
desire
to
press
my
lips
upon
yours
do
be
afraid
that
i
shall
be
brutal
enough
to
do
it
without
your
consent
my
respect
for
you
is
stronger
even
than
my
passion
when
i
first
saw
you
i
thought
you
interesting
because
of
your
evident
intelligence
nothing
more
indeed
you
were
not
a
woman
to
me
now
you
are
the
one
woman
in
the
world
no
other
can
draw
my
eyes
from
you
touch
me
with
your
fingers
and
i
shall
tremble
that
is
what
my
love
means
she
was
colourless
her
lips
just
parted
quivered
as
the
breath
panted
between
them
she
did
not
try
to
withdraw
her
hand
you
love
me
in
return
everard
went
on
his
face
still
nearer
i
anything
like
this
to
have
the
courage
you
boast
of
speak
to
me
as
one
human
being
to
another
plain
honest
words
do
love
you
in
the
least
and
if
i
did
i
would
never
share
your
life
the
voice
was
very
unlike
her
familiar
tones
it
seemed
to
hurt
her
to
speak
because
you
have
no
faith
in
me
ca
say
whether
i
have
or
not
i
know
absolutely
nothing
of
your
life
but
i
have
my
work
and
no
one
shall
ever
persuade
me
to
abandon
it
work
how
do
you
understand
it
what
is
its
importance
to
you
and
you
pretend
to
know
me
so
well
that
you
wish
me
to
be
your
companion
at
every
moment
she
laughed
mockingly
and
tried
to
draw
away
her
hand
for
it
was
burnt
by
the
heat
of
his
barfoot
held
her
firmly
your
work
copying
with
a
and
teaching
others
to
do
the
same
is
that
it
work
by
which
i
earn
money
yes
but
if
it
were
no
more
than
that
then
passion
was
overmastering
him
as
he
watched
the
fine
scorn
in
her
eyes
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
rhoda
exclaimed
with
sudden
wrath
respect
oh
i
appreciate
your
respect
she
wrenched
herself
from
his
grasp
and
went
apart
barfoot
rose
gazing
at
her
with
admiration
is
better
i
should
be
at
a
distance
from
you
he
said
want
to
know
your
mind
and
not
to
be
made
insensate
it
be
better
still
if
you
left
me
rhoda
suggested
mistress
of
herself
again
you
really
wish
it
he
remembered
the
circumstances
and
spoke
submissively
the
fog
gives
me
such
a
good
excuse
for
begging
your
indulgence
the
chances
are
i
should
only
lose
myself
in
an
inferno
it
strike
you
that
you
take
an
advantage
of
me
as
you
did
once
before
i
make
no
pretence
of
equalling
you
in
muscular
strength
yet
you
try
to
hold
me
by
force
he
divined
in
her
pleasure
akin
to
his
own
the
delight
of
conflict
otherwise
she
would
never
have
spoken
thus
it
is
true
love
revives
the
barbarian
it
would
mean
much
if
it
did
in
this
one
respect
i
suppose
no
man
however
civilized
would
wish
the
woman
he
loves
to
be
his
equal
marriage
by
capture
ca
quite
be
done
away
with
you
say
you
have
not
the
least
love
for
me
if
you
had
should
i
like
you
to
confess
it
instantly
a
man
must
plead
and
woo
but
there
are
different
ways
i
ca
kneel
before
you
and
exclaim
about
my
miserable
unworthiness
for
i
am
not
unworthy
of
you
i
shall
never
call
you
queen
and
goddess
unless
in
delirium
and
i
think
i
should
soon
weary
of
the
woman
who
put
her
head
under
my
foot
just
because
i
am
stronger
than
you
and
have
stronger
passions
i
take
that
advantage
try
to
overcome
as
i
may
the
womanly
resistance
which
is
one
of
your
charms
useless
then
for
us
to
talk
if
you
are
determined
to
remind
me
again
and
again
that
your
strength
puts
me
at
your
mercy
not
that
i
will
come
no
nearer
to
you
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
i
asked
rhoda
hesitated
but
at
length
took
the
chair
by
which
she
was
standing
are
resolved
never
to
marry
never
shall
rhoda
replied
firmly
suppose
marriage
in
no
way
interfered
with
your
work
would
interfere
hopelessly
with
the
best
part
of
my
life
i
thought
you
understood
this
what
would
become
of
the
encouragement
i
am
able
to
offer
our
girls
to
refuse
marriage
scorn
the
old
idea
that
a
woman
life
is
wasted
if
she
does
not
marry
my
work
is
to
help
those
women
who
by
sheer
necessity
must
live
alone
women
whom
vulgar
opinion
ridicules
how
can
i
help
them
so
effectually
as
by
living
among
them
one
of
them
and
showing
that
my
life
is
anything
but
weariness
and
lamentation
i
am
fitted
for
this
it
gives
me
a
sense
of
power
and
usefulness
which
i
enjoy
your
cousin
is
doing
the
same
work
admirably
if
i
deserted
i
should
despise
myself
if
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
living
without
you
i
should
bid
you
persevere
and
be
great
need
no
such
bidding
to
persevere
for
that
very
reason
because
you
are
capable
of
such
things
i
love
you
only
the
more
there
was
triumph
in
her
look
though
she
endeavoured
to
disguise
it
for
your
own
peace
she
said
must
hope
that
you
will
avoid
me
it
is
so
easily
done
we
have
nothing
in
common
mr
barfoot
ca
agree
with
that
for
one
thing
there
are
perhaps
not
half
a
dozen
women
living
with
whom
i
could
talk
as
i
have
talked
with
you
it
is
likely
that
i
shall
ever
meet
one
am
i
to
make
my
bow
and
abandon
in
resignation
the
one
chance
of
perfecting
my
life
do
know
me
we
differ
profoundly
on
a
thousand
essential
points
think
so
because
you
have
a
very
wrong
idea
of
me
rhoda
glanced
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
barfoot
she
said
in
a
changed
voice
will
forgive
me
if
i
remind
you
that
it
is
past
ten
he
sighed
and
rose
fog
certainly
can
not
be
so
thick
now
shall
i
ask
them
to
try
and
get
you
a
cab
shall
walk
to
the
station
one
more
word
she
assumed
a
quiet
dignity
which
he
could
not
disregard
have
spoken
in
this
way
for
the
last
time
you
will
not
oblige
me
to
take
all
sorts
of
trouble
merely
to
avoid
useless
and
painful
conversations
love
you
and
i
ca
abandon
hope
i
take
that
trouble
her
face
darkened
and
she
stood
in
expectation
of
his
departure
must
offer
to
shake
hands
said
everard
drawing
a
step
nearer
hope
you
can
remember
that
i
had
no
choice
but
to
be
your
hostess
the
face
and
tone
affected
him
with
a
brief
shame
bending
his
head
he
approached
her
and
held
her
offered
hand
without
pressure
only
for
an
instant
then
he
left
the
room
there
was
a
little
improvement
in
the
night
he
could
make
his
way
along
the
pavement
without
actual
groping
and
no
unpleasant
adventure
checked
him
before
he
reached
the
station
rhoda
face
and
figure
went
before
him
he
was
not
downcast
for
all
that
she
had
said
this
woman
soon
or
late
would
yield
herself
he
had
a
strange
unreasoning
assurance
of
it
perhaps
the
obstinacy
of
his
temper
supplied
him
with
that
confident
expectation
he
no
longer
cared
on
what
terms
he
obtained
her
legal
marriage
or
free
union
it
was
indifferent
to
him
but
her
life
should
be
linked
with
his
if
fierce
energy
of
will
meant
anything
miss
barfoot
arrived
at
eleven
after
many
delays
on
her
journey
she
was
pierced
with
cold
choked
with
the
poisonous
air
and
had
derived
very
little
satisfaction
from
her
visit
to
faversham
happened
was
her
first
question
as
rhoda
came
out
into
the
hall
with
sympathy
and
solicitude
the
fog
keep
our
guest
away
he
dined
here
was
just
as
well
you
have
been
lonely
they
spoke
no
more
on
the
subject
until
miss
barfoot
recovered
from
her
discomfort
and
was
enjoying
a
much
needed
supper
he
offer
to
go
away
was
really
impossible
it
took
him
more
than
half
an
hour
to
get
here
from
sloane
square
fellow
why
did
he
take
a
train
back
at
once
there
was
a
peculiar
brightness
in
rhoda
countenance
and
miss
barfoot
had
observed
it
from
the
first
you
quarrel
much
more
than
was
to
be
expected
did
think
of
staying
for
my
return
left
about
ten
course
quite
late
enough
under
the
circumstances
it
was
very
unfortunate
but
i
do
suppose
everard
cared
much
he
would
enjoy
the
opportunity
of
teasing
you
a
glance
told
her
that
everard
was
not
alone
in
his
enjoyment
of
the
evening
rhoda
led
the
talk
into
other
channels
but
miss
barfoot
continued
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
perceived
a
few
evenings
after
when
miss
barfoot
had
been
sitting
alone
for
an
hour
or
two
rhoda
came
to
the
library
and
took
a
place
near
her
the
elder
woman
glanced
up
from
her
book
and
saw
that
her
friend
had
something
special
to
say
is
it
dear
am
going
to
tax
your
to
ask
you
about
unpleasant
things
miss
barfoot
knew
immediately
what
this
meant
she
professed
readiness
to
answer
but
had
an
uneasy
look
you
tell
me
in
plain
terms
what
it
was
that
your
cousin
did
when
he
disgraced
himself
you
really
know
wish
to
know
there
was
a
pause
miss
barfoot
kept
her
eyes
on
the
page
open
before
her
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
an
old
friend
rhoda
why
do
you
wish
to
know
barfoot
answered
the
other
dryly
been
good
enough
to
say
that
he
is
in
love
with
me
their
eyes
met
suspected
it
i
felt
sure
it
was
coming
he
asked
you
to
marry
him
he
did
replied
rhoda
in
purposely
ambiguous
phrase
would
allow
him
to
all
events
it
did
come
to
that
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
let
me
know
what
i
asked
miss
barfoot
deliberated
but
finally
told
the
story
of
amy
drake
her
hands
supporting
one
knee
her
head
bent
rhoda
listened
without
comment
and
to
judge
from
her
features
without
any
emotion
of
any
kind
said
her
friend
at
the
close
the
story
as
it
was
understood
at
the
time
disgraceful
to
him
in
every
particular
he
knew
what
was
said
of
him
and
offered
not
a
word
of
contradiction
but
not
very
long
ago
he
asked
me
one
evening
if
you
had
been
informed
of
this
scandal
i
told
him
that
you
knew
he
had
done
something
which
i
thought
very
base
everard
was
hurt
and
thereupon
he
declared
that
neither
i
nor
any
other
of
his
acquaintances
knew
the
truth
that
he
had
been
maligned
he
refused
to
say
more
and
what
am
i
to
believe
rhoda
was
listening
with
livelier
attention
declared
that
he
was
to
blame
suppose
he
meant
that
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
course
the
truth
can
never
be
known
said
rhoda
with
sudden
indifference
it
does
matter
thank
you
for
satisfying
my
curiosity
miss
barfoot
waited
a
moment
then
laughed
day
rhoda
you
shall
satisfy
mine
if
we
live
long
enough
what
degree
of
blame
might
have
attached
to
barfoot
rhoda
did
not
care
to
ask
herself
she
thought
no
more
of
the
story
of
course
there
must
have
been
other
such
incidents
in
his
career
morally
he
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
men
in
general
she
viewed
with
contempt
the
women
who
furnished
such
opportunities
in
her
judgment
of
the
male
offenders
she
was
more
lenient
more
philosophical
than
formerly
she
had
gained
her
wish
had
enjoyed
her
triumph
a
raising
of
the
finger
and
everard
barfoot
would
marry
her
assured
of
that
she
felt
a
new
contentment
in
life
at
times
when
she
was
occupied
with
things
as
far
as
possible
from
this
experience
a
rush
of
joy
would
suddenly
fill
her
heart
and
make
her
cheek
glow
she
moved
among
people
with
a
conscious
dignity
quite
unlike
that
which
had
only
satisfied
her
need
of
distinction
she
spoke
more
softly
exercised
more
patience
smiled
where
she
had
been
wont
to
scoff
miss
nunn
was
altogether
a
more
amiable
person
yet
she
convinced
herself
essentially
quite
unchanged
she
pursued
the
aim
of
her
life
with
less
bitterness
in
a
larger
spirit
that
was
all
but
pursued
it
and
without
fear
of
being
diverted
from
the
generous
path
chapter
xviii
a
reinforcement
throughout
january
barfoot
was
endeavouring
to
persuade
his
brother
tom
to
leave
london
where
the
invalid
health
perceptibly
grew
worse
doctors
were
urgent
to
the
same
end
but
ineffectually
for
thomas
though
she
professed
to
be
amazed
at
her
husband
folly
in
remaining
where
he
could
not
hope
for
recovery
herself
refused
to
accompany
him
any
whither
this
pair
had
no
children
the
lady
always
spoke
of
herself
as
a
sad
sufferer
from
mysterious
infirmities
and
had
in
fact
a
tendency
to
hysteria
which
confused
itself
inextricably
with
the
results
of
evil
nurture
and
the
impulses
of
a
disposition
originally
base
nevertheless
she
made
a
figure
in
a
certain
sphere
of
vulgar
wealth
and
even
gave
opportunity
to
scandalous
tongues
her
husband
whatever
his
secret
thought
would
hear
nothing
against
her
his
temper
like
everard
was
marked
with
stubbornness
and
after
a
good
deal
of
wrangling
he
forbade
his
brother
to
address
him
again
on
the
subject
of
their
disagreement
is
dying
wrote
everard
early
in
february
to
his
cousin
in
queen
road
swain
assures
me
that
unless
he
be
removed
he
can
not
last
more
than
a
month
or
two
this
morning
i
saw
the
woman
it
was
thus
he
always
referred
to
his
talked
to
her
in
what
was
probably
the
plainest
language
she
ever
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
it
was
a
tremendous
scene
brought
to
a
close
only
by
her
flinging
herself
on
the
sofa
with
shrieks
which
terrified
the
whole
household
my
idea
is
that
we
must
carry
the
poor
fellow
away
by
force
his
infatuation
makes
me
rage
and
curse
but
i
am
bent
on
trying
to
save
his
life
will
you
come
and
give
your
help
a
week
later
they
succeeded
in
carrying
the
invalid
back
to
torquay
barfoot
had
abandoned
him
to
his
doctors
nurses
and
angry
relatives
she
declared
herself
driven
out
of
the
house
and
went
to
live
at
a
fashionable
hotel
everard
remained
in
devon
for
more
than
a
month
devoting
himself
with
affection
which
the
trial
of
his
temper
seemed
only
to
increase
to
his
brother
welfare
thomas
improved
a
little
once
more
there
was
hope
then
on
a
sudden
frantic
impulse
after
writing
fifty
letters
which
elicited
no
reply
he
travelled
in
pursuit
of
his
wife
and
three
days
after
his
arrival
in
london
he
was
dead
by
a
will
executed
at
torquay
he
bequeathed
to
everard
about
a
quarter
of
his
wealth
all
the
rest
went
to
barfoot
who
had
declared
herself
too
ill
to
attend
the
funeral
but
in
a
fortnight
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
visit
one
of
her
friends
in
the
country
everard
could
now
count
upon
an
income
of
not
much
less
than
fifteen
hundred
a
year
that
his
brother
death
would
enrich
him
he
had
always
foreseen
but
no
man
could
have
exerted
himself
with
more
ardent
energy
to
postpone
that
advantage
the
widow
charged
him
wherever
she
happened
to
be
with
deliberate
fratricide
she
vilified
his
reputation
by
word
of
mouth
or
by
letter
to
all
who
knew
him
and
protested
that
his
furious
wrath
at
not
having
profited
more
largely
by
the
will
put
her
in
fear
of
her
life
this
last
remarkable
statement
was
made
in
a
long
and
violent
epistle
to
miss
barfoot
which
the
recipient
showed
to
her
cousin
on
the
first
opportunity
everard
had
called
one
sunday
morning
it
was
the
end
of
march
to
say
on
his
departure
for
a
few
weeks
travel
having
read
the
letter
he
laughed
with
a
peculiar
fierceness
kind
of
thing
said
miss
barfoot
necessitate
your
prosecuting
her
there
is
a
limit
you
know
even
to
a
woman
licence
am
far
more
likely
he
replied
purchase
a
very
nice
little
cane
and
give
her
an
exemplary
thrashing
oh
my
word
i
see
no
reason
against
it
that
how
i
should
deal
with
a
man
who
talked
about
me
in
this
way
and
none
the
less
if
he
were
a
puny
creature
quite
unable
to
protect
himself
in
that
furious
scene
before
we
got
tom
away
i
felt
most
terribly
tempted
to
beat
her
there
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
i
am
quite
sure
that
many
a
labouring
man
who
pommels
his
wife
is
doing
exactly
the
right
thing
no
other
measure
would
have
the
least
result
you
see
what
comes
of
impunity
if
this
woman
saw
the
possibility
that
i
should
give
her
a
public
caning
she
would
be
far
more
careful
how
she
behaved
herself
let
us
ask
miss
nunn
opinion
rhoda
had
that
moment
entered
the
room
she
offered
her
hand
frankly
and
asked
what
the
subject
was
over
this
letter
said
barfoot
you
have
seen
it
i
propose
to
get
a
light
supple
dandyish
cane
and
to
give
thomas
barfoot
half
a
dozen
smart
cuts
across
the
back
in
her
own
some
afternoon
when
people
were
present
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
he
spoke
with
such
show
of
angry
seriousness
that
rhoda
paused
before
replying
sympathized
with
you
she
said
at
length
i
do
think
i
would
go
to
that
extremity
everard
repeated
the
argument
he
had
used
to
his
cousin
are
quite
right
rhoda
assented
think
many
women
deserve
to
be
beaten
and
ought
to
be
beaten
but
public
opinion
would
be
so
much
against
do
i
care
so
is
public
opinion
against
you
well
do
as
you
like
miss
barfoot
and
i
will
come
to
the
police
court
and
give
strong
evidence
in
your
favour
there
a
woman
exclaimed
everard
not
all
in
jest
for
appearance
had
made
his
nerves
thrill
and
his
pulse
beat
at
her
mary
do
you
wonder
that
i
would
walk
the
diameter
of
the
globe
to
win
her
love
rhoda
flushed
scarlet
and
miss
barfoot
was
much
embarrassed
neither
could
have
anticipated
such
an
utterance
as
this
the
simple
truth
went
on
everard
recklessly
she
knows
it
and
yet
listen
to
me
well
to
you
both
now
that
i
have
so
grossly
misbehaved
myself
she
has
a
good
excuse
for
refusing
even
to
enter
the
room
when
i
am
here
but
do
speak
a
word
for
me
whilst
i
am
away
mary
he
shook
hands
with
them
scarcely
looking
at
their
faces
and
abruptly
departed
the
women
stood
for
a
moments
at
a
distance
from
each
other
then
miss
barfoot
glanced
at
her
friend
and
laughed
my
poor
cousin
is
not
very
discreet
but
rhoda
answered
resting
on
the
back
of
a
chair
her
eyes
cast
down
you
think
he
will
really
cane
his
can
you
ask
such
a
question
would
be
amusing
i
should
think
better
of
him
for
it
make
it
a
condition
we
know
the
story
of
the
lady
and
her
glove
i
can
see
you
sympathize
with
her
rhoda
laughed
and
went
away
leaving
miss
barfoot
with
the
impression
that
she
had
revealed
a
genuine
impulse
it
seemed
not
impossible
that
rhoda
might
wish
to
say
to
her
lover
this
monstrous
scandal
and
i
am
yours
a
week
passed
and
there
arrived
a
letter
with
a
foreign
stamp
addressed
to
miss
nunn
happening
to
receive
it
before
miss
barfoot
had
come
down
to
breakfast
she
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
till
evening
leisure
and
made
no
mention
of
its
arrival
exhilaration
appeared
in
her
behaviour
through
the
day
after
dinner
she
disappeared
shutting
herself
up
to
read
the
letter
miss
nunn
i
am
sitting
at
a
little
marble
table
outside
a
café
on
the
cannibiere
does
that
name
convey
anything
to
you
the
cannibiere
is
the
principal
street
of
marseilles
street
of
gorgeous
cafés
and
restaurants
just
now
blazing
with
electric
light
you
no
doubt
are
shivering
by
the
fireside
here
it
is
like
an
evening
of
summer
i
have
dined
luxuriously
and
i
am
taking
my
coffee
whilst
i
write
at
a
table
near
to
me
sit
two
girls
engaged
in
the
liveliest
possible
conversation
of
which
i
catch
a
few
words
now
and
then
pretty
french
phrases
that
caress
the
ear
one
of
them
is
so
strikingly
beautiful
that
i
can
not
take
my
eyes
from
her
when
they
have
been
tempted
to
that
quarter
she
speaks
with
indescribable
grace
and
animation
has
the
sweetest
eyes
and
lips
all
the
time
i
am
thinking
of
some
one
else
ah
if
were
here
how
we
would
enjoy
ourselves
among
these
southern
scenes
alone
it
is
delightful
but
with
you
for
a
companion
with
you
to
talk
about
everything
in
your
splendidly
frank
way
this
french
girl
talk
is
of
course
only
silly
chatter
it
makes
me
long
to
hear
a
few
words
from
your
lips
strong
brave
intelligent
dream
of
the
ideal
possibility
suppose
i
were
to
look
up
and
see
you
standing
just
in
front
of
me
there
on
the
pavement
you
have
come
in
a
few
hours
straight
from
london
your
eyes
glow
with
delight
we
shall
travel
on
to
genoa
you
and
i
more
than
friends
and
infinitely
more
than
the
common
husband
and
wife
we
have
bidden
the
world
go
round
for
amusement
henceforth
it
is
our
occupation
to
observe
and
discuss
and
make
merry
it
all
in
vain
rhoda
if
you
never
love
me
my
life
will
be
poor
to
what
it
might
have
been
and
you
you
also
will
lose
something
in
imagination
i
kiss
your
hands
and
your
lips
everard
barfoot
there
was
an
address
at
the
head
of
this
letter
but
certainly
barfoot
expected
no
reply
and
rhoda
had
no
thought
of
sending
one
every
night
however
she
unfolded
the
sheet
of
thin
foreign
paper
and
read
more
than
once
what
was
written
upon
it
read
it
with
external
calm
with
a
brow
of
meditation
and
afterwards
sat
for
some
time
in
absent
mood
would
he
write
again
her
daily
question
was
answered
in
rather
more
than
a
fortnight
this
time
the
letter
came
from
italy
it
was
lying
on
the
hall
table
when
rhoda
returned
from
great
portland
street
and
miss
barfoot
was
the
first
to
read
the
address
they
exchanged
no
remark
on
breaking
the
envelope
she
did
so
at
once
rhoda
found
a
little
bunch
of
violets
crushed
but
fragrant
in
return
for
your
cheddar
pinks
began
the
informal
note
accompanying
the
flowers
had
them
an
hour
ago
from
a
pretty
girl
in
the
streets
of
parma
i
did
care
to
buy
and
walked
on
but
the
pretty
girl
ran
by
me
and
with
gentle
force
fixed
the
flowers
in
my
so
that
i
had
no
choice
but
to
stroke
her
velvety
cheek
and
give
her
a
lira
how
hungry
i
am
for
the
sight
of
your
face
think
of
me
sometimes
dear
friend
she
laughed
and
laid
the
letter
and
its
violets
away
with
the
other
must
depend
on
you
it
seems
for
news
of
everard
said
miss
barfoot
after
dinner
can
only
tell
you
rhoda
answered
lightly
he
has
travelled
from
the
south
of
france
to
the
north
of
italy
with
much
observation
of
female
countenances
informs
you
of
that
naturally
it
is
his
chief
interest
one
likes
people
to
tell
the
truth
barfoot
was
away
until
the
end
of
april
but
after
that
note
from
parma
he
did
not
write
one
bright
afternoon
in
may
a
saturday
he
presented
himself
at
his
cousin
house
and
found
two
or
three
callers
in
the
ladies
as
usual
one
of
them
was
miss
winifred
haven
another
was
widdowson
mary
received
him
without
effusiveness
and
after
a
few
minutes
talk
with
her
he
took
a
place
by
widdowson
who
it
struck
him
looked
by
no
means
in
such
good
spirits
as
during
the
early
days
of
her
marriage
as
soon
as
she
began
to
converse
his
impression
of
a
change
in
her
was
confirmed
the
girlishness
so
pleasantly
noticeable
when
first
he
knew
her
had
disappeared
and
the
gravity
substituted
for
it
was
suggestive
of
disillusion
of
trouble
she
asked
him
if
he
knew
some
people
named
bevis
who
occupied
a
flat
just
above
his
own
i
have
seen
the
name
on
the
index
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
i
do
know
them
personally
was
how
i
came
to
know
that
live
there
said
monica
husband
took
me
to
call
upon
the
bevises
and
there
we
saw
your
name
at
least
we
supposed
it
was
you
and
miss
barfoot
tells
me
we
were
right
yes
i
live
there
all
alone
a
gloomy
bachelor
how
delightful
if
you
knocked
at
my
door
some
day
when
you
and
widdowson
are
again
calling
on
your
friends
monica
smiled
and
her
eyes
wandered
restlessly
have
been
away
out
of
england
she
next
said
in
italy
envy
you
have
never
been
there
not
yet
he
talked
a
little
of
the
agreeables
and
disagreeables
of
life
in
that
country
but
widdowson
had
become
irresponsive
he
doubted
at
length
whether
she
was
listening
to
him
so
as
miss
haven
stepped
this
way
he
took
an
opportunity
of
a
word
aside
with
his
cousin
nunn
not
at
home
wo
be
till
well
was
better
would
you
care
to
come
back
and
dine
with
us
at
seven
course
i
should
with
this
pleasant
prospect
he
took
his
leave
the
afternoon
being
sunny
instead
of
walking
straight
to
the
station
to
return
home
he
went
out
on
to
the
embankment
and
sauntered
round
by
chelsea
bridge
road
as
he
entered
sloane
square
he
saw
widdowson
who
was
coming
towards
the
railway
she
walked
rather
wearily
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
did
not
become
aware
of
him
until
he
addressed
her
we
travelling
the
same
way
he
asked
i
am
going
all
the
way
round
to
portland
road
they
entered
the
station
barfoot
chatting
humorously
and
so
intent
was
he
on
the
expression
of
his
companion
downcast
face
that
he
allowed
an
acquaintance
to
pass
close
by
him
unobserved
it
was
rhoda
nunn
returning
sooner
than
miss
barfoot
had
expected
she
saw
the
pair
regarded
them
with
a
moment
keen
attentiveness
and
went
on
out
into
the
street
in
the
carriage
which
they
entered
there
was
no
other
passenger
as
far
as
barfoot
station
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
use
rather
an
intimate
tone
though
one
that
was
quite
conventional
in
the
hope
that
he
might
discover
something
of
widdowson
mind
he
began
by
asking
whether
she
thought
it
a
good
academy
this
year
she
had
not
yet
visited
it
but
hoped
to
do
so
on
monday
did
she
herself
do
any
kind
of
artistic
work
oh
nothing
whatever
she
was
a
very
useless
and
idle
person
he
believed
she
had
been
a
pupil
of
miss
barfoot
at
one
time
yes
for
a
very
short
time
indeed
just
before
her
marriage
was
she
not
an
intimate
friend
of
miss
nunn
hardly
intimate
they
knew
each
other
a
few
years
ago
but
miss
nunn
did
not
care
much
about
her
now
because
i
married
she
added
with
a
smile
miss
nunn
really
such
a
determined
enemy
of
marriage
thinks
it
pardonable
in
very
weak
people
in
my
case
she
was
indulgent
enough
to
come
to
the
wedding
this
piece
of
news
surprised
barfoot
came
to
your
wedding
and
wore
a
wedding
garment
yes
and
looked
very
nice
describe
it
to
me
can
you
remember
seeing
that
no
woman
ever
forgot
the
details
of
another
dress
on
however
trivial
an
occasion
and
at
whatever
distance
of
time
monica
was
of
course
able
to
satisfy
the
inquirer
her
curiosity
excited
she
ventured
in
turn
upon
one
or
two
insidious
questions
could
imagine
miss
nunn
in
such
a
costume
should
very
much
like
to
have
seen
her
has
a
very
striking
face
do
you
think
so
i
do
a
wonderful
face
their
eyes
met
barfoot
bent
forward
from
his
place
opposite
monica
me
the
most
interesting
of
all
faces
he
said
softly
his
companion
blushed
with
surprise
and
pleasure
it
seem
strange
to
you
mrs
widdowson
why
not
at
all
all
at
once
she
had
brightened
astonishingly
this
subject
was
not
pursued
but
for
the
rest
of
the
time
they
talked
with
a
new
appearance
of
mutual
confidence
and
interest
monica
retaining
her
pretty
smile
and
when
barfoot
alighted
at
bayswater
they
shook
hands
with
an
especial
friendliness
both
seeming
to
suggest
a
wish
that
they
might
soon
meet
again
they
did
so
not
later
than
the
following
monday
remembering
what
widdowson
had
said
of
her
intention
to
visit
burlington
house
barfoot
went
there
in
the
afternoon
if
he
chanced
to
encounter
the
pretty
little
woman
it
would
not
be
disagreeable
perhaps
her
husband
might
be
with
her
and
in
that
case
he
could
judge
of
the
terms
on
which
they
stood
a
surly
fellow
widdowson
very
likely
to
play
the
tyrant
he
thought
if
he
were
not
mistaken
she
had
wearied
of
him
and
regretted
her
bondage
the
old
story
thinking
thus
and
strolling
through
the
rooms
with
casual
glances
at
a
picture
he
discovered
his
acquaintance
catalogue
in
hand
alone
for
the
present
her
pensive
face
again
answered
to
his
smile
they
drew
back
from
the
pictures
and
sat
down
dined
with
our
friends
at
chelsea
on
saturday
evening
said
barfoot
saturday
you
did
tell
me
you
were
going
back
again
was
thinking
of
it
just
at
the
time
monica
hinted
an
amused
surprise
see
he
went
on
expected
nothing
and
happy
for
me
that
it
was
so
miss
nunn
was
in
her
severest
mood
i
think
she
did
smile
once
through
the
evening
i
will
confess
to
you
i
wrote
her
a
letter
whilst
i
was
abroad
and
it
offended
her
i
suppose
do
think
you
can
always
judge
of
her
thoughts
by
her
face
not
but
i
have
studied
her
face
so
often
and
so
closely
for
all
that
she
is
more
a
mystery
to
me
than
any
woman
i
have
ever
known
that
of
course
is
partly
the
reason
of
her
power
over
me
i
feel
that
if
ever
if
ever
she
should
disclose
herself
to
me
it
would
be
the
strangest
revelation
every
woman
wears
a
mask
except
to
one
man
but
rhoda
miss
nunn
is
i
fancy
a
far
completer
disguise
than
i
ever
tried
to
pierce
monica
had
a
sense
of
something
perilous
in
this
conversation
it
arose
from
a
secret
trouble
in
her
own
heart
which
she
might
involuntarily
be
led
to
betray
she
had
never
talked
thus
confidentially
with
any
man
not
in
truth
with
her
husband
there
was
no
fear
whatever
of
her
conceiving
an
undue
interest
in
barfoot
certain
reasons
assured
her
of
that
but
talk
that
was
at
all
sentimental
gravely
threatened
her
peace
what
little
remained
to
her
it
would
have
been
better
to
discourage
this
man
confidences
yet
they
flattered
her
so
pleasantly
and
afforded
such
a
fruitful
subject
for
speculation
that
she
could
not
obey
the
prompting
of
prudence
you
mean
she
said
miss
nunn
seems
to
disguise
her
feelings
is
supposed
to
be
wrong
is
it
for
a
man
to
ask
one
woman
her
opinion
of
another
ca
be
treacherous
if
i
wished
monica
replied
do
feel
that
i
understand
her
barfoot
wondered
how
much
intelligence
he
might
attribute
to
widdowson
obviously
her
level
was
much
below
that
of
rhoda
yet
she
seemed
to
possess
delicate
sensibilities
and
a
refinement
of
thought
not
often
met
with
in
women
of
her
position
seriously
desiring
her
aid
he
looked
at
her
with
a
grave
smile
and
asked
you
believe
her
capable
of
falling
in
love
monica
showed
a
painful
confusion
she
overcame
it
however
and
soon
answered
would
perhaps
try
not
not
to
acknowledge
it
to
herself
in
fact
it
had
happened
thinks
it
so
much
nobler
to
disregard
such
feelings
know
she
is
to
be
an
inspiring
example
to
the
women
who
can
not
hope
to
marry
he
laughed
silently
i
suppose
it
is
quite
possible
that
mere
shame
would
withhold
her
from
taking
the
opposite
course
think
she
is
very
strong
but
he
looked
eagerly
into
her
face
ca
tell
i
do
really
know
her
a
woman
may
be
as
much
a
mystery
to
another
woman
as
she
is
to
a
man
the
whole
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
believe
it
it
is
only
the
vulgar
that
hold
a
different
opinion
we
look
at
the
pictures
mr
barfoot
i
am
so
sorry
i
have
been
wasting
your
time
nervously
disclaiming
any
such
thought
monica
rose
and
drew
near
to
the
canvases
they
walked
on
together
for
some
ten
minutes
until
barfoot
who
had
turned
to
look
at
a
passing
figure
said
in
his
ordinary
voice
think
that
is
widdowson
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
monica
looked
quickly
round
and
saw
her
husband
as
if
occupied
with
the
pictures
glancing
in
her
direction
chapter
xix
the
clank
of
the
chains
since
saturday
evening
monica
and
her
husband
had
not
been
on
speaking
terms
a
visit
she
paid
to
mildred
vesper
after
her
call
at
miss
barfoot
prolonged
itself
so
that
she
did
not
reach
home
until
the
was
long
past
on
arriving
she
was
met
with
an
outburst
of
tremendous
wrath
to
which
she
opposed
a
resolute
and
haughty
silence
and
since
then
the
two
had
kept
as
much
apart
as
possible
widdowson
knew
that
monica
was
going
to
the
academy
he
allowed
her
to
set
forth
alone
and
even
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
indifferent
as
to
the
hour
of
her
return
but
she
had
not
long
been
gone
before
he
followed
insufferable
misery
possessed
him
his
married
life
threatened
to
terminate
in
utter
wreck
and
he
had
the
anguish
of
recognizing
that
to
a
great
extent
this
catastrophe
would
be
his
own
fault
resolve
as
he
might
he
found
it
impossible
to
repress
the
impulses
of
jealousy
which
as
soon
as
peace
had
been
declared
between
them
brought
about
a
new
misunderstanding
terrible
thoughts
smouldered
in
his
mind
he
felt
himself
to
be
one
of
those
men
who
are
driven
by
passion
into
crime
deliberately
he
had
brooded
over
a
tragic
close
to
the
wretchedness
of
his
existence
he
would
kill
himself
and
monica
should
perish
with
him
but
an
hour
of
contentment
sufficed
to
banish
such
visions
as
sheer
frenzy
he
saw
once
more
how
harmless
how
natural
were
monica
demands
and
how
peacefully
he
might
live
with
her
but
for
the
curse
of
suspicion
from
which
he
could
not
free
himself
any
other
man
would
deem
her
a
model
of
wifely
virtue
her
care
of
the
house
was
all
that
reason
could
desire
in
her
behaviour
he
had
never
detected
the
slightest
impropriety
he
believed
her
chaste
as
any
woman
living
she
asked
only
to
be
trusted
and
that
in
spite
of
all
was
beyond
his
power
in
no
woman
on
earth
could
he
have
put
perfect
confidence
he
regarded
them
as
born
to
perpetual
pupilage
not
that
their
inclinations
were
necessarily
wanton
they
were
simply
incapable
of
attaining
maturity
remained
throughout
their
life
imperfect
beings
at
the
mercy
of
craft
ever
liable
to
be
misled
by
childish
misconceptions
of
course
he
was
right
he
himself
represented
the
guardian
male
the
who
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
has
taken
abundant
care
that
woman
shall
not
outgrow
her
nonage
the
bitterness
of
his
situation
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
had
wedded
a
woman
who
irresistibly
proved
to
him
her
claims
as
a
human
being
reason
and
tradition
contended
in
him
to
his
ceaseless
torment
and
again
he
feared
that
monica
did
not
love
him
had
she
ever
loved
him
there
was
too
much
ground
for
suspecting
that
she
had
only
yielded
to
the
persistence
of
his
entreaties
with
just
liking
enough
to
permit
a
semblance
of
tenderness
and
glad
to
exchange
her
prospect
of
distasteful
work
for
a
comfortable
married
life
her
liking
he
might
have
fostered
during
those
first
happy
weeks
assuredly
he
had
done
so
for
no
woman
could
be
insensible
to
the
passionate
worship
manifest
in
his
every
look
his
every
word
later
he
took
the
wrong
path
seeking
to
oppose
her
instincts
to
reform
her
mind
eventually
to
become
her
lord
and
master
could
he
not
even
now
retrace
his
steps
supposing
her
incapable
of
bowing
before
him
of
kissing
his
feet
could
he
not
be
content
to
make
of
her
a
loyal
friend
a
delightful
companion
in
that
mood
he
hastened
towards
burlington
house
seeking
monica
through
the
galleries
he
saw
her
at
length
sitting
side
by
side
with
that
man
barfoot
they
were
in
closest
colloquy
barfoot
bent
towards
her
as
if
speaking
in
an
undertone
a
smile
on
his
face
monica
looked
at
once
pleased
and
troubled
the
blood
boiled
in
his
veins
his
first
impulse
was
to
walk
straight
up
to
monica
and
bid
her
follow
him
but
the
ecstasy
of
jealous
suffering
kept
him
an
observer
he
watched
the
pair
until
he
was
descried
there
was
no
help
for
it
though
his
brain
whirled
and
his
flesh
was
stabbed
he
had
no
choice
but
to
take
the
hand
barfoot
offered
him
smile
he
could
not
nor
speak
a
word
you
have
come
after
all
monica
was
saying
to
him
he
nodded
on
her
countenance
there
was
obvious
embarrassment
but
this
needed
no
explanation
save
the
history
of
the
last
day
or
two
looking
into
her
eyes
he
knew
not
whether
consciousness
of
wrong
might
be
read
there
how
to
get
at
the
secrets
of
this
woman
heart
barfoot
was
talking
pointing
at
this
picture
and
that
doing
his
best
to
smooth
what
he
saw
was
an
awkward
situation
the
gloomy
husband
more
like
a
tyrant
than
ever
muttered
incoherent
phrases
in
a
minute
or
two
everard
freed
himself
and
moved
out
of
sight
monica
turned
from
her
husband
and
affected
interest
in
the
pictures
they
reached
the
end
of
the
room
before
widdowson
spoke
long
do
you
want
to
stay
here
will
go
whenever
you
like
she
answered
without
looking
at
him
have
no
wish
to
spoil
your
pleasure
i
have
very
little
pleasure
in
anything
did
you
come
to
keep
me
in
sight
think
we
will
go
home
now
and
you
can
come
another
day
monica
assented
by
closing
her
catalogue
and
walking
on
without
a
word
they
made
the
journey
back
to
herne
hill
widdowson
shut
himself
in
the
library
and
did
not
appear
till
the
meal
was
a
pretence
for
both
of
them
and
as
soon
as
they
could
rise
from
the
table
they
again
parted
about
ten
monica
was
joined
by
her
husband
in
the
have
almost
made
up
my
mind
he
said
standing
near
her
take
a
serious
step
as
you
have
always
spoken
with
pleasure
of
your
old
home
clevedon
suppose
we
give
up
this
house
and
go
and
live
there
is
for
you
to
decide
want
to
know
whether
you
would
have
any
objection
shall
do
as
you
wish
that
is
enough
the
plan
i
have
in
mind
is
this
i
should
take
a
good
large
house
no
doubt
rents
are
low
in
the
neighbourhood
and
ask
your
sisters
to
come
and
live
with
us
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
both
for
them
and
for
you
ca
be
sure
that
they
would
agree
to
it
you
see
that
virginia
prefers
her
lodgings
to
living
here
oddly
enough
this
was
the
case
on
their
return
from
guernsey
they
had
invited
virginia
to
make
a
permanent
home
with
them
and
she
refused
her
reasons
monica
could
not
understand
those
which
she
alleged
vague
arguments
as
to
its
being
better
for
a
wife
relatives
not
to
burden
the
husband
hardly
seemed
genuine
it
was
possible
that
virginia
had
a
distaste
for
widdowson
society
think
they
both
would
be
glad
to
live
at
clevedon
he
urged
from
your
sisters
talk
it
plain
that
they
have
quite
given
up
the
idea
of
the
school
and
alice
you
tell
me
is
getting
dissatisfied
with
her
work
at
yatton
but
i
must
know
whether
you
will
enter
seriously
into
this
scheme
monica
kept
silence
answer
me
have
you
thought
of
it
do
think
i
need
explain
we
have
had
too
many
unpleasant
conversations
and
i
wish
to
act
for
the
best
without
saying
things
you
would
misunderstand
is
no
fear
of
my
misunderstanding
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
and
you
want
to
get
me
away
into
a
quiet
country
place
where
i
shall
be
under
your
eyes
every
moment
it
much
better
to
say
that
plainly
means
you
would
consider
it
going
to
prison
could
i
help
what
other
motive
have
you
he
was
prompted
to
make
brutal
declaration
of
authority
and
so
cut
the
knot
monica
unanswerable
argument
merely
angered
him
but
he
made
an
effort
over
himself
you
think
it
best
that
we
should
take
some
step
before
our
happiness
is
irretrievably
ruined
see
no
need
for
its
ruin
as
i
have
told
you
before
in
talking
like
that
you
degrade
yourself
and
insult
me
have
my
faults
i
know
them
only
too
well
one
of
them
is
that
i
can
not
bear
you
to
make
friends
with
people
who
are
not
of
my
kind
i
shall
never
be
able
to
endure
that
course
you
are
speaking
of
mr
barfoot
he
avowed
sullenly
was
a
very
unfortunate
thing
that
i
happened
to
come
up
just
as
he
was
in
your
company
are
so
very
unreasonable
exclaimed
monica
tartly
possible
harm
is
there
in
barfoot
when
he
meets
me
by
chance
in
a
public
place
having
a
conversation
with
me
i
wish
i
knew
twenty
such
men
such
conversation
gives
me
a
new
interest
in
life
i
have
every
reason
to
think
well
of
mr
barfoot
widdowson
was
in
anguish
i
he
replied
in
a
voice
shaken
with
angry
feeling
that
i
have
every
reason
to
dislike
and
suspect
him
he
is
not
an
honest
man
his
face
tells
me
that
i
know
his
life
would
bear
inspection
you
ca
possibly
be
as
good
a
judge
as
i
am
in
such
a
case
contrast
him
with
bevis
no
bevis
is
a
man
one
can
trust
one
talk
with
him
produces
a
lasting
favourable
impression
monica
silent
for
a
brief
space
looked
fixedly
before
her
her
features
all
but
expressionless
even
with
bevis
she
said
at
length
do
make
friends
that
is
the
fault
in
you
which
causes
all
this
trouble
you
have
a
sociable
spirit
your
dislike
of
barfoot
only
means
that
you
know
him
and
do
wish
to
and
you
are
completely
wrong
in
your
judgment
of
him
i
have
every
reason
for
being
sure
that
you
are
wrong
course
you
think
so
in
your
ignorance
of
the
world
you
think
very
proper
in
a
woman
she
interposed
caustically
i
do
that
kind
of
knowledge
is
harmful
to
a
woman
please
how
is
she
to
judge
her
acquaintances
married
woman
must
accept
her
husband
opinion
at
all
events
about
men
he
plunged
on
into
the
ancient
quagmire
man
may
know
with
impunity
what
is
injurious
if
it
enters
a
woman
mind
do
believe
that
i
ca
and
wo
believe
it
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
differ
hopelessly
it
was
all
very
well
to
discuss
these
things
when
you
could
do
so
in
a
friendly
spirit
now
you
say
whatever
you
know
will
irritate
me
and
you
say
it
on
purpose
to
irritate
me
indeed
i
do
not
but
you
are
quite
right
that
i
find
it
hard
to
be
friendly
with
you
most
earnestly
i
wish
to
be
your
friend
your
true
and
faithful
friend
but
you
wo
let
me
he
cried
scornfully
woman
who
has
become
my
wife
ought
to
be
something
more
than
a
friend
i
should
think
you
have
lost
all
love
for
me
there
the
misery
monica
could
not
reply
that
word
had
grown
a
weariness
to
her
upon
his
lips
she
did
not
love
him
could
not
pretend
to
love
him
every
day
the
distance
between
them
widened
and
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
had
to
struggle
with
a
sense
of
shrinking
of
disgust
the
union
was
unnatural
she
felt
herself
constrained
by
a
hateful
force
when
he
called
upon
her
for
the
show
of
wifely
tenderness
yet
how
was
she
to
utter
this
the
moment
such
a
truth
had
passed
her
lips
she
must
leave
him
to
declare
that
no
trace
of
love
remained
in
her
heart
and
still
to
live
with
him
that
was
impossible
the
dark
foresight
of
a
necessity
of
parting
from
him
corresponded
in
her
to
those
lurid
visions
which
at
times
shook
widdowson
with
a
horrible
temptation
do
love
me
he
continued
in
harsh
choking
tones
wish
to
be
my
that
how
you
try
to
compensate
me
for
the
loss
of
your
love
he
laughed
with
bitterness
you
say
that
monica
answered
you
ever
ask
yourself
whether
you
try
to
make
me
love
you
scenes
like
this
are
ruining
my
health
i
have
come
to
dread
your
talk
i
have
almost
forgotten
the
sound
of
your
voice
when
it
is
either
angry
or
complaining
widdowson
walked
about
the
room
and
a
deep
moan
escaped
him
is
why
i
have
asked
you
to
go
away
from
here
monica
we
must
have
a
new
home
if
our
life
is
to
begin
anew
have
no
faith
in
mere
change
of
place
you
would
be
the
same
man
if
you
can
not
command
your
senseless
jealousy
here
you
never
would
anywhere
else
he
made
an
effort
to
say
something
seemed
to
abandon
it
again
tried
and
spoke
in
a
thick
unnatural
voice
you
honestly
repeat
to
me
what
barfoot
was
saying
when
you
were
on
the
seat
together
monica
eyes
flashed
could
every
word
but
i
shall
not
try
to
do
so
if
i
beseech
you
to
monica
to
put
my
mind
at
rest
when
i
tell
you
that
you
might
have
heard
every
syllable
i
have
said
all
that
i
shall
it
mortified
him
profoundly
that
he
should
have
been
driven
to
make
so
humiliating
a
request
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
hid
his
face
sitting
thus
for
a
long
time
in
the
hope
that
monica
would
be
moved
to
compassion
but
when
she
rose
it
was
only
to
retire
for
the
night
and
with
wretchedness
in
her
heart
because
she
must
needs
go
to
the
same
chamber
in
which
her
husband
would
sleep
she
wished
so
to
be
alone
the
poorest
bed
in
a
servant
garret
would
have
been
thrice
welcome
to
her
liberty
to
lie
awake
to
think
without
a
disturbing
presence
to
shed
tears
if
need
be
that
seemed
to
her
a
precious
boon
she
thought
with
envy
of
the
in
walworth
road
wished
herself
back
there
what
unspeakable
folly
she
had
committed
and
how
true
was
everything
she
had
heard
from
rhoda
nunn
on
the
subject
of
marriage
the
next
day
widdowson
resorted
to
an
expedient
which
he
had
once
before
tried
in
like
circumstances
he
wrote
his
wife
a
long
letter
eight
close
pages
reviewing
the
cause
of
their
troubles
confessing
his
own
errors
insisting
gently
on
those
chargeable
to
her
and
finally
imploring
her
to
cooperate
with
him
in
a
sincere
endeavour
to
restore
their
happiness
this
he
laid
on
the
table
after
lunch
and
then
left
monica
alone
that
she
might
read
it
knowing
beforehand
all
that
the
letter
contained
monica
glanced
over
it
carelessly
an
answer
was
expected
and
she
wrote
one
as
briefly
as
possible
behaviour
seems
to
me
very
weak
very
unmanly
you
make
us
both
miserable
and
quite
without
cause
i
can
only
say
as
i
have
said
before
that
things
will
never
be
better
until
you
come
to
think
of
me
as
your
free
companion
not
as
your
if
you
ca
do
this
you
will
make
me
wish
that
i
had
never
met
you
and
in
the
end
i
am
sure
it
wo
be
possible
for
us
to
go
on
living
together
she
left
this
note
in
a
blank
envelope
on
the
hall
table
and
went
out
to
walk
for
an
hour
it
was
the
end
of
one
more
acute
stage
in
their
progressive
discord
by
keeping
at
home
for
a
fortnight
monica
soothed
her
husband
and
obtained
some
repose
for
her
own
nerves
but
she
could
no
longer
affect
a
cordial
reconciliation
caresses
left
her
cold
and
widdowson
saw
that
his
company
was
never
so
agreeable
to
her
as
solitude
when
they
sat
together
both
were
reading
monica
found
more
attraction
in
books
as
her
life
grew
more
unhappy
though
with
reluctance
widdowson
had
consented
to
a
subscription
at
mudie
and
from
the
new
catalogues
she
either
chose
for
herself
necessarily
at
random
or
by
the
advice
of
people
such
as
she
met
at
cosgrove
what
modern
teaching
was
to
be
got
from
these
volumes
her
mind
readily
absorbed
she
sought
for
opinions
and
arguments
which
were
congenial
to
her
mood
of
discontent
all
but
of
revolt
sometimes
the
perusal
of
a
embittered
her
lot
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
before
marriage
her
had
been
very
vague
elusive
it
found
scarcely
more
than
negative
expression
as
a
shrinking
from
the
vulgar
or
gross
desires
of
her
companions
in
the
shop
now
that
she
had
a
clearer
understanding
of
her
own
nature
the
type
of
man
correspondent
to
her
natural
sympathies
also
became
clear
in
every
particular
he
was
unlike
her
husband
she
found
a
suggestion
of
him
in
books
and
in
actual
life
already
perhaps
something
more
than
a
suggestion
widdowson
jealousy
in
so
far
as
it
directed
itself
against
her
longing
for
freedom
was
fully
justified
this
consciousness
often
made
her
sullen
when
she
desired
to
express
a
nobler
indignation
but
his
special
prejudice
led
him
altogether
astray
and
in
free
resistance
on
this
point
she
found
the
relief
which
enabled
her
to
bear
a
secret
her
refusal
to
repeat
the
substance
of
barfoot
conversation
was
in
some
degree
prompted
by
a
wish
for
the
continuance
of
his
groundless
fears
by
persevering
in
suspicion
of
barfoot
he
afforded
her
a
firm
foothold
in
their
quarrels
a
husband
misdirected
jealousy
excites
in
the
wife
derision
and
a
sense
of
superiority
more
often
than
not
it
fosters
an
unsuspected
attachment
prompts
to
a
perverse
pleasure
in
misleading
monica
became
aware
of
this
in
her
hours
of
misery
she
now
and
then
gave
a
harsh
laugh
the
result
of
thoughts
not
seriously
entertained
but
tempting
the
fancy
to
recklessness
what
she
asked
herself
again
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
ten
years
hence
would
she
have
subdued
her
soul
to
a
life
of
weary
insignificance
if
not
of
dishonour
for
it
was
dishonour
to
live
with
a
man
she
could
not
love
whether
her
heart
cherished
another
image
or
was
merely
vacant
a
dishonour
to
which
innumerable
women
submitted
a
dishonour
glorified
by
social
precept
enforced
under
dread
penalties
but
she
was
so
young
and
life
abounds
in
unexpected
changes
chapter
xx
the
first
lie
cosgrove
was
a
childless
widow
with
sufficient
means
and
a
very
mixed
multitude
of
acquaintances
in
the
general
belief
her
marriage
had
been
a
happy
one
when
she
spoke
of
her
deceased
husband
it
was
with
respect
and
not
seldom
with
affection
yet
her
views
on
the
matrimonial
relation
were
known
to
be
of
singular
audacity
she
revealed
them
only
to
a
small
circle
of
intimates
most
of
the
people
who
frequented
her
house
had
no
startling
theories
to
maintain
and
regarded
their
hostess
as
a
rather
eccentric
woman
who
loved
society
and
understood
how
to
amuse
her
guests
wealth
and
position
were
rarely
represented
in
her
nor
on
the
other
hand
was
bohemianism
cosgrove
belonged
by
birth
and
marriage
to
the
staid
middle
class
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
made
it
her
object
to
provide
with
social
entertainment
the
kind
of
persons
who
in
an
ordinary
way
would
enjoy
very
little
of
it
lonely
and
impecunious
girls
or
women
were
frequently
about
her
she
tried
to
keep
them
in
good
spirits
tried
to
marry
them
if
marriage
seemed
possible
and
it
was
whispered
used
a
good
deal
of
her
income
for
the
practical
benefit
of
those
who
needed
assistance
a
sprinkling
of
maidens
who
were
neither
lonely
nor
impecunious
served
to
attract
young
men
generally
strugglers
in
some
profession
or
other
on
the
lookout
for
a
wife
intercourse
went
on
with
a
minimum
of
formalities
chaperonage
save
for
that
represented
by
the
hostess
herself
was
as
often
as
not
dispensed
with
want
to
get
rid
of
a
lot
of
sham
propriety
so
she
urged
to
her
closer
friends
must
learn
to
trust
themselves
and
look
out
for
dangers
if
a
girl
can
only
be
kept
straight
by
incessant
watchfulness
why
let
her
go
where
she
will
and
learn
by
experience
in
fact
i
want
to
see
experience
substituted
for
precept
between
this
lady
and
miss
barfoot
there
were
considerable
divergences
of
opinion
yet
they
agreed
on
a
sufficient
number
of
points
to
like
each
other
very
well
occasionally
one
of
cosgrove
passed
into
miss
barfoot
hands
abandoning
the
thought
of
matrimony
for
study
in
great
portland
street
rhoda
nunn
also
had
a
liking
for
cosgrove
though
she
made
no
secret
of
her
opinion
that
cosgrove
influence
was
on
the
whole
decidedly
harmful
house
she
once
said
to
miss
barfoot
nothing
more
than
a
matrimonial
agency
so
is
every
house
where
many
people
are
entertained
in
the
same
way
cosgrove
was
speaking
to
me
of
some
girl
who
has
just
accepted
an
offer
of
marriage
i
do
think
they
suit
each
other
she
said
but
there
no
harm
in
trying
miss
barfoot
could
not
restrain
a
laugh
knows
perhaps
she
is
right
in
that
view
of
things
after
all
you
know
it
only
putting
into
plain
words
what
everybody
thinks
on
all
but
every
such
occasion
first
part
of
her
remark
yes
said
rhoda
caustically
as
for
the
no
harm
in
trying
well
let
us
ask
the
wife
opinion
in
a
year
time
midway
in
the
london
season
on
sunday
afternoon
about
a
score
of
visitors
were
assembled
in
cosgrove
there
were
two
of
them
with
a
landing
between
as
usual
some
one
sat
at
the
piano
but
a
hum
of
talk
went
on
as
undercurrent
to
the
music
downstairs
in
the
library
half
a
dozen
people
found
the
quietness
they
preferred
and
among
these
was
widdowson
she
had
an
album
of
portraits
on
her
lap
whilst
turning
them
over
she
listened
to
a
chat
going
on
between
the
sprightly
bevis
and
a
young
married
woman
who
laughed
ceaselessly
at
his
jokes
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
since
she
had
come
down
from
the
presently
her
eyes
encountered
a
glance
from
bevis
and
at
once
he
stepped
over
to
a
seat
beside
her
sisters
are
not
here
she
said
they
have
guests
of
their
own
and
when
are
you
coming
to
see
them
again
long
i
hope
bevis
looked
away
and
seemed
to
reflect
come
next
saturday
could
you
had
better
not
promise
try
and
he
lowered
his
voice
alone
forgive
me
for
saying
that
the
girls
are
rather
afraid
of
widdowson
that
the
truth
they
would
so
like
a
free
gossip
with
you
let
me
tell
them
to
expect
you
about
three
or
four
they
will
rise
up
and
call
me
blessed
laughing
monica
at
length
agreed
to
come
if
circumstances
were
favourable
her
talk
with
bevis
continued
for
a
long
time
until
people
had
begun
to
leave
some
other
acquaintance
then
claimed
her
but
she
was
now
dull
and
monosyllabic
as
if
conversation
had
exhausted
her
energies
at
six
she
stole
away
unobserved
and
went
home
widdowson
had
resigned
himself
in
appearance
at
all
events
to
these
absences
it
was
several
weeks
since
he
had
accompanied
his
wife
to
call
upon
any
one
a
sluggishness
was
creeping
over
him
strengthening
his
disinclination
for
society
the
futile
endeavour
to
act
with
decision
to
carry
monica
away
into
somerset
resulted
as
futile
efforts
of
that
kind
are
wont
to
do
in
increased
feebleness
of
the
will
he
was
less
capable
than
ever
of
exerting
the
authority
which
he
still
believed
himself
to
keep
for
the
last
resort
occasionally
some
days
went
by
without
his
leaving
the
house
instead
of
the
one
daily
newspaper
he
had
been
used
to
take
he
now
received
three
after
breakfast
he
sometimes
spent
a
couple
of
hours
over
the
and
the
evening
papers
often
occupied
him
from
dinner
to
bedtime
monica
noticed
with
a
painful
conflict
of
emotions
that
his
hair
had
begun
to
lose
its
uniform
colour
and
to
show
streaks
that
matched
with
his
grizzled
beard
was
responsible
for
this
on
the
saturday
when
she
was
to
visit
the
bevises
she
feared
lest
he
should
propose
to
go
with
her
she
wished
even
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
telling
him
where
she
was
going
as
she
rose
from
luncheon
widdowson
glanced
at
her
ordered
the
trap
monica
will
you
come
for
a
drive
have
promised
to
go
into
the
town
i
very
sorry
does
matter
this
was
his
latest
mode
of
appealing
to
her
with
an
air
of
pained
resignation
a
day
or
two
i
have
felt
at
all
well
he
continued
gloomily
thought
a
drive
might
do
me
good
i
hope
it
will
when
would
you
like
to
have
dinner
never
care
to
alter
the
hours
of
course
i
shall
be
back
at
the
usual
time
shall
be
yes
long
before
dinner
so
she
got
away
without
any
explanation
at
a
quarter
to
four
she
reached
the
block
of
flats
in
which
the
bevises
and
everard
barfoot
resided
with
a
fluttering
of
the
heart
she
went
very
quietly
upstairs
as
if
anxious
that
her
footsteps
should
not
be
heard
her
knock
at
the
door
was
timid
bevis
in
person
opened
to
her
i
thought
it
be
she
entered
and
walked
into
the
first
room
where
she
had
been
once
before
but
to
her
surprise
it
was
vacant
she
looked
round
and
saw
bevis
countenance
gleaming
with
satisfaction
sisters
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
few
minutes
at
most
will
you
take
this
chair
widdowson
how
delighted
i
am
that
you
were
able
to
come
so
perfectly
natural
was
his
manner
that
monica
after
the
first
moment
of
consternation
tried
to
forget
that
there
was
anything
irregular
in
her
presence
here
under
these
circumstances
as
regards
social
propriety
a
flat
differs
in
many
respects
from
a
house
in
an
ordinary
it
could
scarcely
have
mattered
if
bevis
entertained
her
for
a
short
space
until
his
sisters
arrival
but
in
this
little
set
of
rooms
it
was
doubtfully
permissible
for
her
to
sit
with
a
young
man
under
any
excuse
and
the
fact
of
his
opening
the
front
door
himself
seemed
to
suggest
that
not
even
a
servant
was
in
the
flat
a
tremor
grew
upon
her
as
she
talked
due
in
part
to
the
consciousness
that
she
was
glad
to
be
thus
alone
with
bevis
place
like
this
must
seem
to
you
to
be
very
unhomelike
he
was
saying
as
he
lounged
on
a
low
chair
not
very
far
from
her
girls
did
like
it
at
all
at
first
i
suppose
it
a
retrograde
step
in
civilization
servants
are
decidedly
of
that
opinion
we
have
a
great
difficulty
in
getting
them
to
stay
here
the
reason
seems
to
me
that
they
miss
the
congenial
gossip
of
the
area
door
at
this
moment
we
are
without
a
domestic
i
found
she
compensated
herself
for
disadvantages
by
stealing
my
tobacco
and
cigars
she
went
to
work
with
such
a
lack
of
discretion
abstracting
half
a
pound
of
honeydew
at
a
time
that
i
could
find
any
sympathy
for
her
moreover
when
charged
with
the
delinquency
she
became
abusive
so
very
abusive
that
we
were
obliged
to
insist
upon
her
immediate
departure
you
think
she
smoked
asked
monica
laughingly
have
debated
that
point
with
much
interest
she
was
a
person
of
advanced
ideas
as
you
see
practically
a
communist
but
i
doubt
whether
honeydew
had
any
charms
for
her
personally
it
seems
more
probable
that
some
milkman
or
baker
assistant
or
even
metropolitan
policeman
benefited
by
her
communism
indifferent
to
the
progress
of
time
bevis
talked
on
with
his
usual
jocoseness
now
and
then
shaking
his
tawny
hair
in
a
fit
of
laughter
the
most
contagious
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
said
at
length
more
seriously
am
going
to
leave
england
they
want
me
to
live
at
bordeaux
for
a
time
two
or
three
years
perhaps
it
a
great
bore
but
i
shall
have
to
go
i
am
not
my
own
master
your
sisters
will
go
to
guernsey
i
dare
say
i
shall
leave
about
the
end
of
july
he
became
silent
looking
at
monica
with
humorous
sadness
you
think
your
sisters
will
soon
be
here
mr
bevis
monica
asked
with
a
glance
round
the
room
think
so
do
you
know
i
did
a
very
silly
thing
i
wanted
your
visit
if
you
came
to
be
a
surprise
for
them
and
so
in
fact
i
said
nothing
about
it
when
i
got
here
from
business
a
little
before
three
they
were
just
going
out
i
asked
them
if
they
were
sure
they
would
be
back
in
less
than
an
hour
oh
they
were
quite
sure
not
a
doubt
about
it
i
do
hope
they
have
altered
their
mind
and
gone
to
call
somewhere
but
widdowson
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
with
my
own
fair
hands
as
the
novelists
say
monica
begged
that
he
would
not
trouble
under
the
circumstances
she
had
better
not
stay
she
would
come
again
very
soon
i
ca
i
ca
let
you
go
bevis
exclaimed
softening
his
gay
tone
as
he
stood
before
her
shall
i
entreat
you
if
you
knew
what
an
unforgettable
delight
it
will
be
to
me
to
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
i
shall
think
of
it
at
bordeaux
every
saturday
she
had
risen
but
exhibited
no
immutable
resolve
really
must
go
mr
bevis
drive
me
to
despair
i
am
capable
of
turning
my
poor
sisters
out
of
house
and
home
flat
and
home
i
mean
in
anger
at
their
delay
on
their
account
in
pity
for
their
youth
do
stay
widdowson
besides
i
have
a
new
song
that
i
want
you
to
hear
words
and
music
my
own
one
little
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
know
the
girls
will
be
here
directly
his
will
and
her
inclination
prevailed
monica
sat
down
again
and
bevis
disappeared
to
make
the
tea
water
must
have
been
already
boiling
for
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
young
man
returned
with
a
tray
on
which
all
the
necessaries
were
neatly
arranged
with
merry
homage
he
waited
upon
his
guest
monica
cheeks
were
warm
after
the
vain
attempt
to
release
herself
from
what
was
now
distinctly
a
compromising
situation
she
sat
down
in
an
easier
attitude
than
before
as
though
resolved
to
enjoy
her
liberty
whilst
she
might
there
was
a
suspicion
in
her
mind
that
bevis
had
arranged
this
interview
she
doubted
the
truth
of
his
explanation
and
indeed
she
hoped
that
his
sisters
would
not
return
until
after
her
departure
it
would
be
very
embarrassing
to
meet
them
whilst
talking
and
listening
she
silently
defended
herself
against
the
charge
of
impropriety
what
wrong
was
she
committing
what
matter
that
they
were
alone
their
talk
was
precisely
what
it
might
have
been
in
other
people
presence
and
bevis
such
a
frank
fellow
could
not
by
any
possibility
fail
in
respect
to
her
the
objections
were
all
cant
and
cant
of
the
worst
kind
she
would
not
be
a
slave
of
such
ignoble
prejudices
have
made
barfoot
acquaintance
yet
she
asked
i
have
there
seems
to
have
been
no
opportunity
did
you
seriously
wish
me
to
know
him
i
had
no
wish
in
the
matter
at
all
like
mr
barfoot
think
him
very
pleasant
delightful
to
be
praised
by
you
widdowson
now
if
any
one
speaks
to
you
about
when
i
have
left
england
will
you
find
some
nice
word
do
think
me
foolish
i
do
so
desire
the
good
opinion
of
my
friends
to
know
that
you
spoke
of
me
as
you
did
for
barfoot
would
give
me
a
whole
day
of
happiness
enviable
to
be
so
easily
made
happy
let
me
sing
you
this
song
of
mine
it
is
very
good
i
composed
for
years
but
he
sat
down
and
rattled
over
the
keys
monica
was
expecting
a
lively
air
and
spirited
words
as
in
the
songs
she
had
heard
at
guernsey
but
this
composition
told
of
sadness
and
longing
and
the
burden
of
a
lonely
heart
she
thought
it
very
beautiful
very
touching
bevis
looked
round
to
see
the
effect
it
produced
upon
her
and
she
could
not
meet
his
eyes
a
new
sort
of
thing
for
me
widdowson
does
it
strike
you
as
so
very
bad
not
at
all
you
ca
honestly
praise
it
he
sighed
in
dejection
meant
to
give
you
a
copy
i
made
this
one
specially
for
you
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
dedicating
it
to
you
songwriters
do
that
you
know
of
course
it
is
altogether
unworthy
of
your
acceptance
no
indeed
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
bevis
do
give
it
to
me
as
you
meant
to
will
have
it
he
cried
delightedly
for
a
triumphal
march
whilst
he
played
with
look
corresponding
to
the
exultant
strain
monica
rose
from
her
chair
she
stood
with
eyes
downcast
and
lips
pressed
together
when
the
last
chord
had
sounded
i
must
say
bevis
i
am
so
sorry
your
sisters
come
am
i
and
yet
i
am
not
i
have
enjoyed
the
happiest
of
my
life
you
give
me
the
piece
of
music
me
roll
it
up
there
it
wo
be
very
awkward
to
carry
but
of
course
i
shall
see
you
again
before
the
end
of
july
you
will
come
some
other
afternoon
miss
bevis
will
let
me
know
when
she
is
quite
sure
she
shall
do
you
know
i
do
think
i
shall
say
a
word
about
what
has
happened
this
afternoon
will
you
allow
me
to
keep
silence
about
your
call
widdowson
they
would
be
so
annoyed
and
really
it
was
a
silly
thing
not
to
tell
them
monica
gave
no
verbal
reply
she
looked
towards
the
door
bevis
stepped
forward
and
held
it
open
then
you
know
what
i
told
you
about
my
tendency
to
low
spirits
i
going
to
have
a
terrible
turn
down
down
down
she
laughed
and
offered
her
hand
he
held
it
very
lightly
looking
at
her
with
his
blue
eyes
which
indeed
expressed
a
profound
melancholy
you
he
murmured
you
for
your
great
kindness
and
thereupon
he
opened
the
front
door
for
her
without
another
look
monica
went
quickly
down
the
stairs
she
appreciated
his
motive
for
not
accompanying
her
to
the
exit
before
entering
the
house
she
had
managed
to
conceal
the
sheet
of
music
which
she
was
carrying
but
happily
widdowson
was
still
absent
half
an
hour
passed
half
an
hour
of
brooding
and
reverie
before
she
heard
his
footstep
ascending
the
stairs
on
the
landing
she
met
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
enjoyed
your
drive
well
do
you
feel
better
much
dear
but
it
is
worth
talking
about
later
he
inquired
where
she
had
been
had
an
appointment
with
milly
vesper
the
first
falsehood
she
had
ever
told
him
and
yet
uttered
with
such
perfect
assumption
of
sincerity
as
would
have
deceived
the
acutest
observer
he
nodded
discontented
as
usual
but
entertaining
no
doubt
and
from
that
moment
she
hated
him
if
he
had
plied
her
with
interrogations
if
he
had
seemed
to
suspect
anything
the
burden
of
untruth
would
have
been
more
endurable
his
simple
acceptance
of
her
word
was
the
sternest
rebuke
she
could
have
received
she
despised
herself
and
hated
him
for
the
degradation
which
resulted
from
his
lordship
over
her
chapter
xxi
towards
the
decisive
mary
barfoot
had
never
suffered
from
lack
of
interest
in
life
many
a
vivid
moment
dwelt
in
her
memory
joys
and
sorrows
personal
or
of
larger
scope
affected
her
the
more
deeply
because
of
that
ruling
intelligence
which
enabled
her
to
transmute
them
into
principles
no
longer
anticipating
or
desiring
any
great
change
in
her
own
environment
in
the
modes
and
motives
of
her
activity
she
found
it
a
sufficient
happiness
to
watch
and
when
possible
to
direct
the
tendency
of
younger
lives
so
kindly
had
nature
tempered
her
disposition
that
already
she
had
been
able
to
outlive
those
fervours
of
instinct
which
often
make
the
middle
life
of
an
unwedded
woman
one
long
repining
but
her
womanly
sympathies
remained
and
at
present
there
was
going
forward
under
her
own
roof
within
her
daily
observation
a
comedy
a
drama
which
had
power
to
excite
all
her
disinterested
emotions
it
had
been
in
progress
for
twelve
months
and
now
unless
she
was
strangely
mistaken
the
drew
very
near
for
all
her
her
unflinching
recognition
of
physical
and
psychical
facts
which
the
average
woman
blinks
over
mary
deceived
herself
as
to
the
date
of
that
final
triumph
which
permitted
her
to
observe
rhoda
nunn
with
perfect
equanimity
her
outbreak
of
angry
feeling
on
the
occasion
of
bella
royston
death
meant
something
more
than
she
would
acknowledge
before
the
inquisition
of
her
own
mind
it
was
just
then
that
she
had
become
aware
of
rhoda
changing
attitude
towards
everard
barfoot
trifles
such
as
only
a
woman
would
detect
had
convinced
her
that
everard
interest
in
rhoda
was
awakening
a
serious
response
and
this
discovery
though
it
could
not
surprise
her
caused
an
obscure
pang
which
she
attributed
to
impersonal
regret
to
mere
natural
misgiving
for
some
days
she
thought
of
rhoda
in
an
ironic
spirit
then
came
bella
suicide
and
the
conversation
in
which
rhoda
exhibited
a
seeming
heartlessness
the
result
undoubtedly
of
grave
emotional
disturbance
to
her
own
astonishment
mary
was
overcome
with
an
impulse
of
wrathful
hostility
and
spoke
words
which
she
regretted
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
her
lips
poor
bella
had
very
little
to
do
with
this
moment
of
discord
between
two
women
who
sincerely
liked
and
admired
each
other
she
only
offered
the
occasion
for
an
outburst
of
secret
feeling
which
probably
could
not
have
been
avoided
mary
barfoot
had
loved
her
cousin
everard
it
began
when
he
was
she
so
much
older
had
never
allowed
everard
or
any
one
else
to
suspect
her
passion
which
made
her
for
two
or
three
years
more
unhappy
than
she
had
ever
been
or
was
ever
to
be
when
once
her
strong
reason
had
prevailed
the
scandal
of
amy
drake
happening
long
after
revived
her
misery
which
now
took
the
form
of
truly
feminine
intolerance
she
tried
to
believe
that
everard
was
henceforth
of
less
than
no
account
to
her
that
she
detested
him
for
his
vices
amy
drake
however
she
detested
much
more
when
her
friendship
with
rhoda
nunn
had
progressed
to
intimacy
she
could
not
refrain
from
speaking
of
her
cousin
everard
absent
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
perchance
lost
to
her
sight
for
ever
her
mention
of
him
was
severe
yet
of
a
severity
so
obviously
blended
with
other
feeling
that
rhoda
could
not
but
surmise
the
truth
sentimental
confession
never
entered
miss
barfoot
mind
she
had
conquered
her
desires
and
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
make
herself
ridiculous
rhoda
nunn
of
all
women
seemed
the
least
likely
to
make
remarks
or
put
questions
such
as
would
endanger
a
betrayal
of
the
buried
past
yet
at
a
later
time
when
pressing
the
inquiry
whether
rhoda
had
ever
been
in
love
mary
did
not
scruple
to
suggest
that
her
own
knowledge
in
that
direction
was
complete
she
did
it
in
lightness
of
heart
secure
under
the
protection
of
her
forty
years
rhoda
of
course
understood
her
as
referring
to
everard
so
the
quarrel
was
one
of
jealousy
but
no
sooner
had
it
taken
place
when
mary
barfoot
experienced
a
shame
a
distress
which
in
truth
signified
the
completion
of
she
thought
herself
ashamed
of
being
angry
where
anger
was
uncalled
for
in
reality
she
chastised
herself
for
the
last
revival
of
a
conflict
practically
over
and
done
with
so
many
years
ago
and
on
this
very
account
precisely
because
she
was
deceiving
herself
as
to
her
state
of
mind
she
prolonged
the
painful
situation
she
said
to
herself
that
rhoda
had
behaved
so
wrongly
that
displeasure
was
justified
that
to
make
up
the
quarrel
at
once
would
be
unwise
for
miss
nunn
needed
a
little
discipline
this
insistence
upon
the
side
issue
helped
her
to
disregard
the
main
one
and
when
at
length
she
offered
rhoda
the
kiss
of
reconcilement
that
also
signified
something
other
than
was
professed
it
meant
a
hope
that
rhoda
might
know
the
happiness
which
to
her
friend
had
been
denied
everard
announcement
of
his
passion
for
miss
nunn
seemed
to
mary
a
piece
of
boldness
if
he
seriously
sought
rhoda
for
his
wife
this
frank
avowal
of
the
desire
before
a
third
person
might
remove
some
of
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
the
case
whether
willing
or
not
to
be
wooed
rhoda
in
mere
consistency
with
her
pronounced
opinions
must
needs
maintain
a
scornful
silence
on
the
subject
of
everard
by
assailing
this
proud
reserve
this
dignity
which
perchance
had
begun
to
burden
its
supporter
everard
made
possible
if
not
inevitable
a
discussion
of
his
suit
between
the
two
women
she
who
talks
of
her
lover
will
be
led
to
think
of
him
miss
barfoot
knew
not
whether
to
hope
for
the
marriage
of
this
strange
pair
she
was
distrustful
of
her
cousin
found
it
hard
to
imagine
him
a
loyal
husband
and
could
not
be
sure
whether
rhoda
qualities
were
such
as
would
ultimately
retain
or
repel
him
she
inclined
to
think
this
wooing
a
mere
caprice
but
rhoda
gave
ear
to
him
of
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
and
since
his
inheritance
of
ample
means
the
affair
began
to
have
a
new
aspect
that
everard
persevered
though
the
world
of
women
was
now
open
to
him
for
on
a
moderate
computation
any
man
with
barfoot
personal
advantages
and
armed
with
fifteen
hundred
a
year
may
choose
among
fifty
possible
maidens
seemed
to
argue
that
he
was
really
in
love
but
what
it
would
cost
rhoda
to
appear
before
her
friends
in
the
character
of
a
bride
what
a
humbling
of
her
glory
was
she
capable
of
the
love
which
defies
all
humiliation
or
loving
ardently
would
she
renounce
a
desired
happiness
from
dread
of
female
smiles
and
whispers
or
would
it
be
her
sufficient
satisfaction
to
reject
a
wealthy
suitor
and
thus
pose
more
grandly
than
ever
before
the
circle
who
saw
in
her
an
example
of
woman
independence
powerful
was
the
incitement
to
curiosity
in
a
situation
which
however
it
ended
would
afford
such
matter
for
emotional
hypothesis
they
did
not
talk
of
everard
whether
rhoda
replied
to
his
letters
from
abroad
miss
barfoot
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
but
after
his
return
he
had
a
very
cold
reception
due
perhaps
to
some
audacity
he
had
allowed
himself
in
his
correspondence
rhoda
again
avoided
meeting
with
him
and
as
miss
barfoot
noticed
threw
herself
with
increased
energy
into
all
her
old
pursuits
about
your
holiday
this
year
mary
asked
one
evening
in
june
you
go
first
or
shall
i
make
whatever
arrangements
you
like
miss
barfoot
had
a
reason
for
wishing
to
postpone
her
holiday
until
late
in
august
she
said
so
and
proposed
that
rhoda
should
take
any
three
weeks
she
liked
prior
to
that
vesper
she
added
manage
your
room
very
well
we
shall
be
much
more
at
ease
in
that
respect
than
last
year
miss
vesper
is
getting
to
be
very
useful
and
trustworthy
rhoda
mused
when
she
had
made
this
remark
you
know
she
asked
presently
she
sees
much
of
mrs
widdowson
have
no
idea
they
decided
that
rhoda
should
go
away
at
the
close
of
july
where
was
her
holiday
to
be
spent
miss
barfoot
suggested
the
lake
country
was
thinking
of
it
myself
said
rhoda
should
like
to
have
some
though
a
week
by
the
shore
and
then
the
rest
of
the
time
spent
in
vagabondage
among
the
mountains
would
suit
me
very
well
cosgrove
is
at
home
in
cumberland
i
must
ask
her
advice
this
was
done
and
there
resulted
a
scheme
which
seemed
to
excite
rhoda
with
joyous
anticipation
on
the
coast
of
cumberland
a
few
miles
south
of
st
bees
is
a
little
place
called
seascale
unknown
to
the
ordinary
tourist
but
with
a
good
hotel
and
a
few
scattered
houses
where
lodgings
can
be
obtained
not
far
away
rise
the
mountain
barriers
of
wastdale
clearly
discernible
at
seascale
then
rhoda
would
spend
her
first
week
the
quiet
shore
with
its
fine
stretch
of
sand
affording
her
just
the
retreat
that
she
desired
are
one
or
two
cosgrove
says
but
i
hope
to
avoid
such
abominations
how
delicious
it
was
in
one
childhood
when
one
ran
into
the
sea
naked
i
will
enjoy
that
sensation
once
more
if
i
have
to
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
about
this
time
barfoot
made
one
of
his
evening
calls
he
had
no
hope
of
seeing
rhoda
and
was
agreeably
surprised
by
her
presence
in
the
just
as
happened
a
year
ago
the
subject
of
miss
barfoot
making
a
direct
inquiry
with
lively
interest
mary
waited
for
the
reply
and
was
careful
not
to
smile
when
rhoda
made
known
her
intentions
you
planned
a
route
after
your
stay
at
seascale
barfoot
asked
i
shall
do
that
when
i
am
there
whether
or
not
he
intended
a
contrast
to
these
homely
projects
barfoot
presently
began
to
talk
of
travel
on
a
grander
scale
when
he
next
left
england
he
should
go
by
the
orient
express
right
away
to
constantinople
his
cousin
asked
questions
about
the
orient
express
and
he
supplied
her
with
details
very
exciting
to
the
imagination
of
any
one
who
longs
to
see
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
as
undoubtedly
rhoda
did
the
very
name
orient
express
has
a
certain
sublimity
such
as
attaches
more
or
less
to
all
the
familiar
nomenclature
of
he
talked
himself
into
fervour
and
kept
a
watch
on
rhoda
countenance
as
also
did
miss
barfoot
rhoda
tried
to
appear
unaffected
but
her
coldness
betrayed
its
insincerity
the
next
day
when
work
at
great
portland
street
was
just
finished
she
fell
into
conversation
with
mildred
vesper
miss
barfoot
had
an
engagement
to
dine
out
that
evening
and
rhoda
ended
by
inviting
milly
to
come
home
with
her
to
chelsea
to
milly
this
was
a
great
honour
she
hesitated
because
of
her
very
plain
dress
but
easily
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
when
she
saw
that
miss
nunn
really
desired
her
company
before
dinner
they
had
a
walk
in
battersea
park
rhoda
had
never
been
so
frank
and
friendly
she
induced
the
quiet
unpretending
girl
to
talk
of
her
early
days
her
schools
her
family
remarkable
was
quiet
contentedness
not
long
ago
she
had
received
an
increase
of
payment
from
miss
barfoot
and
one
would
have
judged
that
scarcely
a
wish
now
troubled
her
unless
it
were
that
she
might
see
her
scattered
brothers
and
sisters
all
of
whom
happily
were
doing
pretty
well
in
the
struggle
for
existence
must
feel
rather
lonely
in
your
lodgings
sometimes
said
rhoda
rarely
in
future
i
shall
have
music
in
the
evening
our
best
room
has
been
let
to
a
young
man
who
has
a
violin
and
he
plays
the
blue
bells
of
scotland
not
badly
rhoda
did
not
miss
the
humorous
intention
veiled
as
usual
under
a
manner
of
extreme
sedateness
widdowson
come
to
see
you
often
she
came
a
few
days
ago
go
to
her
house
sometimes
have
been
there
for
several
months
at
first
i
used
to
go
rather
frequently
but
it
a
long
way
to
this
subject
rhoda
returned
after
dinner
when
they
were
cosily
settled
in
the
widdowson
comes
here
now
and
then
and
we
are
always
very
glad
to
see
her
but
i
ca
help
thinking
she
looks
rather
unhappy
afraid
she
does
assented
the
other
gravely
and
i
were
both
at
her
wedding
it
was
very
cheerful
was
it
i
had
a
disagreeable
sense
of
bad
omens
all
the
time
do
you
think
she
is
sorry
really
afraid
she
is
rhoda
observed
the
look
that
accompanied
this
admission
girl
why
could
she
stay
with
us
and
keep
her
liberty
she
does
seem
to
have
made
any
new
friends
has
she
spoken
to
you
of
any
of
people
she
has
met
here
rhoda
yielded
or
seemed
to
yield
to
an
impulse
of
frankness
bending
slightly
forward
with
an
anxious
expression
she
said
in
confidential
tones
you
help
to
put
my
mind
at
rest
about
monica
you
saw
her
a
week
ago
did
she
say
anything
or
give
any
sign
that
might
make
one
really
uneasy
on
her
account
there
was
a
struggle
in
milly
before
she
answered
rhoda
added
you
had
rather
not
i
had
rather
tell
you
she
said
a
good
many
strange
things
and
i
been
uneasy
about
her
i
wished
i
could
speak
to
some
one
strange
that
i
should
feel
urged
to
ask
you
about
this
said
rhoda
her
eyes
peculiarly
bright
and
keen
fixed
on
the
girl
face
poor
thing
is
very
miserable
i
am
sure
her
husband
seems
to
leave
her
entirely
to
herself
milly
looked
surprised
made
quite
the
opposite
complaint
to
me
she
said
that
she
was
a
prisoner
very
odd
she
certainly
goes
about
a
good
deal
and
alone
did
know
that
said
milly
has
very
often
talked
to
me
about
a
woman
right
to
the
same
freedom
as
a
man
and
i
always
understood
that
widdowson
objected
to
her
going
anywhere
without
him
except
just
to
call
here
or
at
my
lodgings
you
think
she
has
any
acquaintance
that
he
dislikes
the
direct
answer
was
delayed
but
it
came
at
length
is
some
one
she
has
told
me
who
it
is
plain
words
widdowson
thinks
he
has
cause
for
jealousy
i
understand
monica
to
mean
that
rhoda
face
had
grown
very
dark
she
moved
her
hands
nervously
you
do
think
she
could
deceive
him
i
ca
think
that
replied
miss
vesper
with
much
earnestness
what
i
could
help
fearing
after
i
saw
her
last
was
that
she
might
almost
be
tempted
to
leave
her
husband
she
spoke
so
much
of
freedom
and
of
a
woman
right
to
release
herself
if
she
found
her
marriage
was
a
mistake
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
telling
me
all
this
we
must
try
to
help
her
of
course
i
will
make
no
mention
of
you
miss
vesper
then
you
are
really
under
the
impression
that
there
some
one
she
prefers
to
her
husband
ca
help
thinking
there
is
admitted
the
other
very
solemnly
was
so
sorry
for
her
and
felt
so
powerless
she
cried
a
little
all
i
could
do
was
to
entreat
her
not
to
behave
rashly
i
thought
her
sister
ought
to
know
miss
madden
is
useless
monica
can
not
look
to
her
for
advice
or
support
after
this
conversation
rhoda
passed
a
very
unquiet
night
and
gloom
appeared
in
her
countenance
for
the
next
few
days
she
wished
to
have
a
private
interview
with
monica
but
doubted
whether
it
would
in
any
degree
serve
her
purpose
that
of
discovering
whether
certain
suspicions
she
entertained
had
actual
ground
confidence
between
her
and
widdowson
had
never
existed
and
in
the
present
state
of
things
she
could
not
hope
to
probe
monica
secret
feelings
whilst
she
still
brooded
over
the
difficulty
there
came
a
letter
for
her
from
everard
barfoot
he
wrote
formally
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
of
some
slight
service
in
view
of
her
approaching
holiday
if
he
looked
through
the
and
jotted
down
the
outline
of
such
a
as
she
had
in
mind
this
he
had
done
and
the
results
were
written
out
on
an
enclosed
sheet
of
paper
rhoda
allowed
a
day
to
intervene
then
sent
a
reply
she
thanked
barfoot
sincerely
for
the
trouble
he
had
so
kindly
taken
see
you
limit
me
to
ten
miles
a
day
in
such
scenery
of
course
one
does
hurry
on
but
i
ca
help
informing
you
that
twenty
miles
would
alarm
me
i
think
it
very
likely
that
i
shall
follow
your
itinerary
after
my
week
of
bathing
and
idling
i
leave
on
monday
week
barfoot
did
not
call
again
every
evening
she
sat
in
expectation
of
his
coming
twice
miss
barfoot
was
away
until
a
late
hour
and
on
those
occasions
after
dinner
rhoda
sat
in
complete
idleness
her
face
declaring
the
troubled
nature
of
her
thoughts
on
the
sunday
before
her
departure
she
took
a
sudden
resolve
and
went
to
call
upon
monica
at
herne
hill
widdowson
she
learnt
from
the
servant
had
left
home
about
an
hour
since
widdowson
at
home
yes
he
was
and
rhoda
waited
for
some
time
in
the
until
he
made
his
appearance
of
late
widdowson
had
grown
so
careless
in
the
matter
of
toilet
that
an
unexpected
visit
obliged
him
to
hurry
through
a
change
of
apparel
before
he
could
present
himself
looking
upon
him
for
the
first
time
for
several
months
rhoda
saw
that
misery
was
undermining
the
man
health
words
could
not
have
declared
his
trouble
more
plainly
than
the
haggard
features
and
stiff
depressed
manner
he
fixed
his
sunken
eyes
upon
the
visitor
and
smiled
as
was
plain
only
for
civility
sake
rhoda
did
her
best
to
seem
at
ease
she
explained
standing
for
he
forgot
to
ask
her
to
be
seated
that
she
was
going
away
on
the
morrow
and
had
hoped
to
see
widdowson
who
she
was
told
had
not
been
very
well
of
late
she
is
not
in
very
good
health
said
widdowson
vaguely
has
gone
this
afternoon
to
cosgrove
i
think
you
know
her
less
encouragement
to
remain
could
not
have
been
offered
but
rhoda
conceived
a
hope
of
hearing
something
significant
if
she
persevered
in
conversation
the
awkwardness
of
doing
so
was
indifferent
to
her
you
be
leaving
town
shortly
mr
widdowson
are
not
quite
sure
but
pray
sit
down
miss
nunn
you
have
seen
my
wife
lately
he
took
a
chair
and
rested
his
hands
upon
his
knees
gazing
at
the
visitor
skirt
widdowson
has
been
to
see
us
for
more
than
a
month
if
i
remember
rightly
his
look
expressed
both
surprise
and
doubt
month
but
i
thought
i
had
an
idea
that
she
went
only
a
few
days
ago
the
day
time
great
portland
street
i
mean
to
hear
a
lecture
or
something
of
that
kind
by
miss
barfoot
rhoda
kept
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
replied
hastily
yes
very
likely
i
was
there
that
afternoon
see
that
would
explain
he
seemed
relieved
but
only
for
the
instant
then
his
eyes
glanced
hither
and
thither
with
painful
restlessness
rhoda
observed
him
closely
after
fidgeting
with
his
feet
he
suddenly
took
a
stiff
position
and
said
in
a
louder
voice
are
going
to
leave
london
altogether
i
have
decided
to
take
a
house
at
my
wife
native
place
clevedon
her
sisters
will
come
and
live
with
us
is
a
recent
decision
mr
widdowson
have
thought
about
it
for
some
time
london
does
suit
health
i
sure
it
does
she
will
be
much
better
in
the
country
i
think
that
very
likely
you
say
that
you
have
noticed
her
changed
looks
i
shall
lose
no
time
in
getting
away
he
made
a
great
show
of
determined
energy
few
weeks
we
will
go
down
to
clevedon
at
once
and
find
a
house
yes
we
will
go
or
the
day
after
miss
madden
also
is
very
far
from
well
i
wish
i
had
delayed
so
long
are
doing
very
wisely
i
think
i
had
meant
to
suggest
something
of
this
kind
to
widdowson
perhaps
if
i
went
at
once
to
cosgrove
i
might
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
her
still
there
might
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
go
away
tomorrow
for
three
weeks
ah
then
we
may
be
getting
ready
to
remove
when
you
come
back
the
change
that
had
come
over
him
was
remarkable
he
could
not
keep
his
seat
and
began
to
pace
the
end
of
the
room
seeing
no
possibility
of
prolonging
the
talk
for
her
own
purposes
rhoda
accepted
this
dismissal
and
with
the
briefest
went
her
way
to
cosgrove
she
was
deeply
agitated
monica
had
not
attended
that
lecture
of
miss
barfoot
and
so
it
was
evident
had
purposely
deceived
her
husband
to
what
end
where
were
those
hours
spent
mildred
vesper
report
supplied
grounds
for
sombre
conjecture
and
the
incident
at
sloane
square
station
the
recollection
of
monica
and
barfoot
absorbed
in
talk
seemed
to
have
a
possible
significance
which
fired
rhoda
with
resentment
her
arrival
at
cosgrove
was
too
late
monica
had
been
there
said
the
hostess
but
had
left
nearly
half
an
hour
ago
rhoda
instant
desire
was
to
go
on
to
bayswater
and
somehow
keep
watch
near
the
flats
where
barfoot
lived
monica
might
be
there
her
coming
forth
from
the
building
might
be
detected
but
the
difficulty
of
the
understanding
and
still
more
a
dread
of
being
seen
hovering
about
that
quarter
checked
her
purpose
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
she
returned
home
and
for
an
hour
or
two
kept
in
solitude
has
happened
asked
miss
barfoot
when
they
at
length
met
nothing
that
i
know
of
look
very
strange
imagination
i
have
been
packing
perhaps
it
from
stooping
over
the
trunk
this
by
no
means
satisfied
mary
who
felt
that
things
mysterious
were
going
on
about
her
but
she
could
only
wait
repeating
to
herself
that
the
grand
decidedly
was
not
far
off
at
nine
sounded
the
visitor
bell
if
as
she
thought
likely
the
caller
was
everard
miss
barfoot
decided
that
she
would
disregard
everything
but
the
dramatic
pressure
of
the
moment
and
leave
those
two
alone
together
for
half
an
hour
everard
it
was
he
entered
the
with
an
unusual
air
of
gaiety
have
been
in
the
country
all
day
were
his
first
words
and
he
went
on
to
talk
of
trivial
things
the
doings
of
a
cockney
excursion
party
that
had
come
under
his
notice
in
a
few
minutes
mary
made
an
excuse
for
absenting
herself
when
she
was
gone
rhoda
looked
steadily
at
barfoot
and
asked
you
really
been
out
of
town
should
you
doubt
it
left
this
morning
and
have
only
just
returned
i
told
you
she
averted
her
look
after
examining
her
curiously
everard
came
and
stood
before
her
want
to
ask
your
leave
to
meet
you
somewhere
during
these
next
three
weeks
at
any
point
on
your
route
we
could
have
a
day
ramble
together
and
then
say
lake
country
is
free
to
you
mr
barfoot
i
must
miss
you
you
will
leave
seascale
week
present
i
think
so
but
i
ca
restrict
myself
by
any
agreement
holiday
must
be
a
time
of
liberty
they
looked
at
each
other
she
with
a
carelessness
which
was
all
but
defiance
he
with
a
significant
smile
week
then
perhaps
we
may
meet
again
rhoda
made
no
reply
beyond
a
movement
of
her
eyebrows
as
if
to
express
indifference
wo
stay
longer
this
evening
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
he
shook
hands
and
left
the
room
in
the
hall
miss
barfoot
came
to
meet
him
they
exchanged
a
few
words
unimportant
and
without
reference
to
what
had
passed
between
him
and
rhoda
nor
did
rhoda
speak
of
the
matter
when
joined
by
her
friend
she
retired
early
having
settled
all
the
arrangements
for
her
departure
by
the
ten
express
from
euston
next
morning
her
luggage
was
to
consist
of
one
trunk
and
a
wallet
with
a
strap
which
would
serve
the
purposes
of
a
man
knapsack
save
the
indispensable
umbrella
she
carried
no
impeding
trifles
a
new
costume
suitable
for
shore
and
mountain
was
packed
away
in
the
trunk
miss
barfoot
had
judged
of
its
effect
and
was
of
opinion
that
it
became
the
wearer
admirably
but
rhoda
having
adjusted
everything
that
she
was
going
to
take
with
her
still
had
an
occupation
which
kept
her
up
for
several
hours
from
a
locked
drawer
she
brought
forth
packets
of
letters
the
storage
of
many
years
and
out
of
these
selected
carefully
perhaps
a
tithe
which
she
bound
together
and
deposited
in
a
box
the
remainder
she
burnt
in
the
empty
fireplace
moreover
she
collected
from
about
the
room
a
number
of
little
objects
ornaments
and
things
of
use
which
also
found
a
place
in
the
same
big
box
all
her
personal
property
which
had
any
value
for
her
except
books
was
finally
under
lock
and
key
and
in
portable
repositories
but
still
she
kept
moving
as
if
in
search
of
trifles
that
might
have
escaped
her
notice
silently
in
her
soft
slippers
she
strayed
hither
and
thither
till
the
short
summer
night
had
all
but
given
place
to
dawn
and
when
at
length
weariness
compelled
her
to
go
to
bed
she
was
not
able
to
sleep
nor
did
mary
barfoot
enjoy
much
sleep
that
night
she
lay
thinking
and
forecasting
strange
possibilities
on
monday
evening
returned
from
great
portland
street
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
visit
rhoda
chamber
the
ashes
of
burnt
paper
had
been
cleared
away
but
a
glance
informed
her
of
the
needless
and
unprecedented
care
with
which
miss
nunn
had
collected
and
packed
most
of
the
things
that
belonged
to
her
again
mary
had
a
troubled
night
chapter
xxii
honour
in
difficulties
at
cosgrove
this
sunday
afternoon
monica
had
eyes
and
thoughts
for
one
person
only
her
coming
at
all
was
practically
an
appointment
to
meet
bevis
whom
she
had
seen
twice
since
her
visit
to
the
flat
a
day
or
two
after
that
occasion
she
received
a
call
from
the
bevis
girls
who
told
her
of
their
brother
approaching
departure
for
bordeaux
and
thereupon
she
invited
the
trio
to
dine
with
her
a
fortnight
subsequently
to
the
dinner
she
had
a
chance
encounter
with
bevis
in
oxford
street
constraint
of
business
did
not
allow
him
to
walk
beside
her
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
but
they
spoke
of
cosgrove
on
the
following
sunday
and
there
accordingly
found
each
other
tremor
of
kept
monica
in
dread
of
being
watched
and
suspected
few
people
were
present
and
after
exchanging
formal
words
with
bevis
she
moved
away
to
talk
with
the
hostess
not
till
half
an
hour
had
passed
did
she
venture
to
obey
the
glances
which
her
all
but
avowed
lover
cast
towards
her
in
conversation
he
was
so
much
at
ease
so
like
what
she
had
always
known
him
that
monica
asked
herself
whether
she
had
not
mistaken
the
meaning
of
his
homage
one
moment
she
hoped
it
might
be
so
the
next
she
longed
for
some
sign
of
passionate
devotion
and
thought
with
anguish
of
the
day
now
so
near
when
he
would
be
gone
for
ever
this
she
ardently
believed
was
the
man
who
should
have
been
her
husband
him
she
could
love
with
heart
and
soul
could
make
his
will
her
absolute
law
could
live
on
his
smiles
could
devote
herself
to
his
interests
the
independence
she
had
been
struggling
to
assert
ever
since
her
marriage
meant
only
freedom
to
love
if
she
had
understood
herself
as
she
now
did
her
life
would
never
have
been
thus
cast
into
bondage
girls
bevis
was
saying
on
thursday
the
rest
of
the
week
i
shall
be
alone
on
monday
the
furniture
will
be
stowed
away
at
the
pantechnicon
and
on
tuesday
off
i
go
a
casual
listener
could
have
supposed
that
the
prospect
pleased
him

with
a
fixed
smile
looked
at
the
other
groups
conversing
in
the
room
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
her
in
the
same
moment
she
heard
a
murmur
from
her
companion
lips
he
was
speaking
still
but
in
a
voice
only
just
audible
on
friday
afternoon
about
four
her
heart
began
to
throb
painfully
and
she
knew
that
a
treacherous
colour
had
risen
to
her
checks
come
once
more
for
the
last
time
it
shall
be
just
as
before
just
as
before
an
hour
talk
and
we
will
say
to
each
other
she
was
powerless
to
breathe
a
word
bevis
noticing
that
cosgrove
had
thrown
a
look
in
their
direction
suddenly
laughed
as
if
at
some
jest
between
them
and
resumed
his
lively
strain
of
talk
monica
also
laughed
an
interval
of
and
again
the
soft
murmur
fell
upon
her
ear
shall
expect
you
i
know
you
wo
refuse
me
this
one
last
kindness
some
day
his
voice
was
all
but
extinguished
day
who
knows
dreadful
hope
struck
through
her
a
stranger
eyes
turned
their
way
and
again
she
laughed
friday
at
four
i
shall
expect
you
she
rose
looked
for
an
instant
about
the
room
then
offered
him
her
hand
uttering
some
commonplace
word
of
their
eyes
did
not
meet
she
went
up
to
cosgrove
and
as
soon
as
possible
left
the
house
widdowson
met
her
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
of
home
his
face
told
her
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
and
she
trembled
before
him
already
he
exclaimed
with
a
grim
smile
quick
and
take
your
things
off
and
come
to
the
library
if
he
had
discovered
anything
the
lie
for
instance
that
she
told
him
a
month
ago
or
that
more
recent
falsehood
when
she
pretended
without
serious
reason
to
have
been
at
miss
barfoot
lecture
he
would
not
look
and
speak
thus
hurrying
panting
she
made
a
change
of
dress
and
obeyed
his
summons
nunn
has
been
here
were
his
first
words
she
turned
pale
as
death
of
course
he
observed
it
she
was
now
preparing
for
anything
wanted
to
see
you
because
she
is
going
away
on
monday
what
the
matter
you
spoke
so
strangely
i
and
you
very
strangely
i
do
understand
you
miss
nunn
says
that
everybody
has
noticed
how
ill
you
seem
it
time
we
did
something
morning
we
are
going
down
into
somerset
to
clevedon
to
find
a
house
thought
you
had
given
up
that
idea
i
had
or
not
does
matter
in
the
determination
to
appear
and
be
energetic
he
spoke
with
a
rough
obstinacy
a
doggedness
that
now
and
then
became
violence
am
decided
on
it
now
there
a
train
to
bristol
at
you
will
pack
just
a
few
things
we
sha
be
away
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
by
friday
they
might
be
back
till
now
in
an
anguish
of
uncertainty
monica
had
made
up
her
mind
she
would
keep
the
appointment
on
friday
come
of
it
what
might
if
she
could
not
be
back
in
time
she
would
write
a
letter
are
you
talking
in
this
tone
she
said
coldly
tone
i
am
telling
you
what
i
have
decided
to
do
that
all
i
shall
easily
find
a
house
down
there
no
doubt
knowing
the
place
you
will
be
able
to
suggest
the
likely
localities
she
sat
down
for
strength
was
failing
her
quite
true
widdowson
went
on
staring
at
her
with
inflamed
eyes
are
beginning
to
look
like
a
ghost
oh
we
have
an
end
of
this
he
cackled
in
angry
laughter
a
day
unnecessary
delay
write
to
both
your
sisters
this
evening
and
tell
them
i
wish
them
both
to
come
and
live
with
us
well
wo
you
be
glad
wo
it
be
better
in
every
way
he
came
so
near
that
she
felt
his
feverish
breath
told
you
before
she
answered
do
just
as
you
liked
you
wo
talk
about
being
kept
a
prisoner
monica
laughed
no
i
wo
say
anything
at
all
she
scarcely
knew
what
words
fell
from
her
lips
let
him
propose
let
him
do
what
he
liked
to
her
it
was
indifferent
she
saw
something
before
her
something
she
durst
not
even
an
hour
ago
have
steadily
contemplated
it
drew
her
with
the
force
of
fate
know
we
could
go
on
living
like
this
do
you
monica
we
could
see
he
almost
shouted
in
triumph
misled
by
the
smile
on
her
face
that
was
needed
was
resolution
on
my
part
i
have
been
absurdly
weak
and
weakness
in
the
husband
means
unhappiness
in
the
wife
from
today
you
look
to
me
for
guidance
i
am
no
tyrant
but
i
shall
rule
you
for
your
own
good
still
she
smiled
there
an
end
of
our
misery
is
it
darling
what
misery
good
god
how
i
have
suffered
have
you
known
it
have
known
it
too
well
now
you
will
make
up
to
me
for
it
monica
again
prompted
by
the
irresistible
force
she
answered
mechanically
will
do
the
best
for
both
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
beside
her
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
that
is
my
own
dear
wife
once
more
your
face
has
altogether
changed
see
how
right
it
is
that
a
husband
should
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
our
second
year
of
marriage
shall
be
very
different
from
the
first
and
yet
we
happy
were
we
my
beautiful
it
only
this
cursed
london
that
has
come
between
us
at
clevedon
we
shall
begin
our
life
over
again
like
we
did
at
guernsey
all
our
trouble
i
am
convinced
has
come
of
your
this
air
has
never
suited
you
you
have
felt
miserable
and
could
be
at
peace
in
your
home
poor
little
girl
my
poor
darling
through
the
evening
he
was
in
a
state
of
transport
due
partly
to
the
belief
that
monica
really
welcomed
his
decision
partly
to
the
sense
of
having
behaved
at
length
like
a
resolute
man
his
eyes
were
severely
bloodshot
and
before
bedtime
headache
racked
him
intolerably
everything
was
carried
out
as
he
had
planned
it
they
journeyed
down
into
somerset
put
up
at
a
clevedon
hotel
and
began
on
wednesday
the
suitable
abode
was
discovered
a
house
of
modest
pretensions
but
roomy
and
well
situated
it
could
be
made
ready
for
occupation
in
a
fortnight
bent
on
continuing
his
exhibition
of
vigorous
promptitude
widdowson
signed
a
lease
that
same
evening
we
will
go
straight
home
and
make
our
preparations
for
removal
when
all
is
ready
you
shall
come
down
here
and
live
at
the
hotel
until
the
house
is
furnished
go
to
your
sister
virginia
and
simply
bid
her
do
as
you
wish
imitate
me
he
laughed
fatuously
listen
to
any
objection
when
you
have
once
got
her
away
she
will
thank
you
by
thursday
afternoon
they
were
back
at
herne
hill
widdowson
still
kept
up
the
show
of
extravagant
spirits
but
he
was
worn
out
he
spoke
so
hoarsely
that
one
would
have
thought
he
had
contracted
a
severe
sore
throat
it
resulted
merely
from
nervous
strain
after
a
pretence
of
dinner
he
seated
himself
as
if
to
read
glancing
at
him
a
few
minutes
later
monica
found
that
he
was
fast
asleep
she
could
not
bear
to
gaze
at
him
yet
her
eyes
turned
thither
again
and
again
his
face
was
repulsive
to
her
the
deep
furrows
the
red
eyelids
the
mottled
skin
moved
her
to
loathing
and
yet
she
pitied
him
his
frantic
exultation
was
the
cruelest
irony
what
would
he
do
what
would
become
of
him
she
turned
away
and
presently
left
the
room
for
the
sound
of
his
uneasy
breathing
made
her
suffer
too
much
when
he
woke
up
he
came
in
search
of
her
and
laughed
over
his
involuntary
nap
now
you
will
go
and
see
your
sister
morning
the
afternoon
i
think
do
let
us
have
any
procrastination
the
morning
the
morning
do
let
me
have
my
way
in
such
a
trifle
as
that
monica
exclaimed
nervously
have
all
sorts
of
things
to
see
to
here
before
i
can
go
out
he
caressed
her
sha
say
that
i
am
unreasonable
in
the
afternoon
then
and
do
listen
to
any
objections
no
it
was
friday
all
the
morning
widdowson
had
business
with
house
agents
and
furniture
removers
for
he
would
not
let
a
day
go
by
without
some
practical
step
towards
release
from
the
life
he
detested
monica
seemed
to
be
equally
active
in
her
own
department
she
was
turning
out
drawers
and
wardrobes
and
making
selection
of
things
on
some
principle
understood
by
herself
a
flush
remained
upon
her
cheeks
in
marked
contrast
to
the
pallor
which
for
a
long
time
had
given
her
an
appearance
of
wasting
away
that
and
her
singularly
bright
eyes
endowed
her
with
beauty
suggestive
of
what
she
might
have
gained
in
happy
marriage
they
had
luncheon
at
one
and
at
a
quarter
to
two
monica
started
by
train
for
clapham
junction
it
was
her
purpose
to
have
a
short
conversation
with
virginia
who
knew
of
the
trip
to
clevedon
and
to
speak
as
though
she
were
quite
reconciled
to
the
thought
of
removal
after
that
she
would
pursue
her
journey
so
as
to
reach
bayswater
by
four
but
virginia
was
not
at
home
conisbee
said
she
had
gone
out
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
with
the
intention
of
returning
by
teatime
after
a
brief
hesitation
monica
requested
the
landlady
to
deliver
a
message
ask
her
not
to
come
to
herne
hill
until
she
hears
from
me
as
i
am
not
likely
to
be
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
this
left
more
time
at
her
disposal
than
she
knew
how
to
employ
she
returned
to
the
railway
station
and
travelled
on
to
victoria
there
in
the
corner
of
a
she
sat
feverishly
impatient
until
her
watch
told
her
that
she
might
take
the
next
train
westward
a
possible
danger
was
before
her
though
perhaps
she
need
not
trouble
herself
with
the
thought
of
such
dangers
what
if
barfoot
happened
to
encounter
her
as
she
ascended
the
stairs
but
most
likely
he
had
no
idea
that
her
female
friends
who
dwelt
on
the
floor
above
him
were
gone
away
did
it
matter
what
he
might
think
in
a
day
or
two
she
came
to
the
street
approached
the
block
of
flats
involuntarily
casting
anxious
glances
about
her
and
when
she
was
within
twenty
yards
of
the
door
it
opened
and
forth
came
barfoot
her
first
sensation
was
unreasoning
terror
her
next
thankfulness
that
she
had
not
been
a
few
minutes
sooner
when
the
very
meeting
she
had
feared
within
the
building
itself
would
have
come
to
pass
he
walked
this
way
he
saw
her
and
the
pleasantest
smile
of
recognition
lit
up
his
face
widdowson
not
a
minute
ago
you
were
in
my
thoughts
i
wished
i
could
see
you
am
going
to
make
a
call
in
this
neighbourhood
she
could
not
command
herself
the
shock
had
left
her
trembling
and
the
necessity
of
feigning
calmness
was
a
new
trial
of
her
nerves
barfoot
she
felt
certain
was
reading
her
face
like
a
printed
page
he
saw
guilt
there
his
eyes
his
peculiar
smile
seemed
to
express
the
facile
tolerance
of
a
man
of
the
world
me
to
accompany
you
to
the
end
of
the
street
his
words
buzzed
in
her
ears
she
walked
on
without
conscious
effort
like
an
automaton
obedient
to
a
touch
know
that
miss
nunn
has
gone
down
into
cumberland
barfoot
was
saying
his
look
bent
upon
her
i
know
she
tried
to
glance
at
him
with
a
smile
he
pursued
am
going
there
myself
cumberland
shall
see
her
i
hope
perhaps
she
will
only
be
angry
with
me
but
perhaps
not
her
confusion
would
not
be
overcome
she
felt
a
burning
in
her
ears
on
her
neck
it
was
an
agony
of
shame
the
words
she
spoke
sounded
imbecile
mutterings
which
must
confirm
barfoot
in
his
worst
opinion
of
her
it
is
all
in
vain
he
continued
i
shall
say
and
there
an
end
hope
not
i
should
think
useless
she
set
her
lips
and
became
mute
if
only
he
would
leave
her
and
almost
immediately
he
did
so
with
a
few
words
of
kind
tone
she
felt
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
saw
him
walk
rapidly
away
doubtless
he
knew
this
was
what
she
desired
until
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
monica
kept
the
same
direction
then
she
turned
round
and
hurried
back
fearful
lest
the
detention
might
make
her
late
and
bevis
might
lose
hope
of
her
coming
there
could
be
no
one
in
the
building
now
whom
she
need
fear
to
meet
she
opened
the
big
entrance
door
and
went
up
bevis
must
have
been
waiting
for
the
sound
of
her
light
footstep
his
door
flew
open
before
she
could
knock
without
speaking
a
silent
laugh
of
joy
upon
his
lips
he
drew
back
to
make
room
for
her
entrance
and
then
pressed
both
her
hands
in
the
were
beginnings
of
disorder
pictures
had
been
taken
down
from
the
walls
and
light
ornaments
removed
sha
sleep
here
after
bevis
began
his
agitation
scarcely
less
obvious
than
monica
i
shall
be
packing
what
is
to
go
with
me
how
i
hate
it
all
monica
dropped
into
a
chair
near
the
door
not
there
he
exclaimed
where
you
sat
before
we
are
going
to
have
tea
together
again
his
utterances
were
forced
and
the
laugh
that
came
between
them
betrayed
the
quivering
of
his
nerves
me
what
you
have
been
doing
i
have
thought
of
you
day
and
night
he
brought
a
chair
close
to
her
and
when
he
had
seated
himself
he
took
one
of
her
hands
monica
scarcely
repressing
a
sob
the
result
of
reaction
from
her
fears
and
miseries
drew
the
hand
away
but
again
he
took
it
the
glove
on
it
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
harm
in
my
holding
your
glove
do
think
of
it
and
talk
to
me
i
love
music
but
no
music
is
like
your
voice
go
on
monday
it
was
her
lips
spoke
the
sentence
not
she
on
tuesday
i
think
widdowson
is
going
to
take
me
away
from
london
she
told
him
the
circumstances
bevis
kept
his
eyes
upon
her
face
with
a
look
of
rapt
adoration
which
turned
at
length
to
pain
and
woeful
perplexity
have
been
married
a
year
he
murmured
if
i
had
met
you
before
that
what
a
cruel
fate
that
we
should
know
each
other
only
when
there
was
no
hope
the
man
revealed
himself
in
this
dolorous
sentimentality
his
wonted
blitheness
and
facetiousness
his
healthy
features
his
supple
frame
suggested
that
when
love
awoke
within
him
he
would
express
it
with
virile
force
but
he
trembled
and
blushed
like
a
young
girl
and
his
accents
fell
at
last
into
a
melodious
whining
he
raised
the
gloved
fingers
to
his
lips
monica
bent
her
face
away
deadly
pale
with
closed
eyes
we
to
part
and
never
again
see
each
other
he
went
on
that
you
love
me
only
say
that
you
love
me
despise
me
for
coming
to
you
like
this
you
in
a
sudden
rapture
he
folded
his
arms
about
her
that
you
love
me
he
kissed
away
the
last
syllable
of
her
whispered
reply
what
is
there
before
us
how
can
i
leave
you
yielding
herself
for
the
moment
in
a
faintness
that
threatened
to
subdue
her
she
was
yet
able
when
his
caresses
grew
wild
with
passion
to
put
back
his
arms
and
move
suddenly
away
he
sprang
up
and
they
stood
speechless
again
he
drew
near
me
away
with
you
monica
then
cried
clasping
her
hands
together
ca
live
with
let
me
go
with
you
to
france
bevis
blue
eyes
widened
with
consternation
you
dare
you
do
that
he
stammered
i
what
courage
is
needed
how
i
remain
with
a
man
i
hate
must
leave
him
of
course
you
must
leave
him
before
another
day
has
passed
sobbed
monica
is
wrong
even
to
go
back
i
love
you
and
in
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
what
bitter
shame
to
be
living
with
practising
hypocrisy
he
makes
me
hate
myself
as
much
as
i
hate
he
behaved
brutally
to
you
dearest
have
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
except
that
he
persuaded
me
to
marry
him
made
me
think
that
i
could
love
him
when
i
did
know
what
love
meant
and
now
he
wishes
to
get
me
away
from
all
the
people
i
know
because
he
is
jealous
of
every
one
and
how
can
i
blame
him
has
he
cause
for
jealousy
i
am
deceiving
him
i
have
deceived
him
for
a
long
time
pretending
to
be
a
faithful
wife
when
i
have
often
wished
that
he
might
die
and
release
me
it
is
i
who
am
to
blame
i
ought
to
have
left
him
every
woman
who
thinks
of
her
husband
as
i
do
ought
to
go
away
from
him
it
is
base
and
wicked
to
stay
there
pretending
deceiving
bevis
came
towards
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
love
me
she
panted
under
his
hot
kisses
will
take
me
away
with
you
you
shall
come
we
must
travel
together
but
you
shall
come
when
i
am
settled
there
ca
i
go
with
you
own
darling
think
what
it
would
mean
if
our
secret
were
discovered
but
how
can
we
think
of
that
how
can
i
go
back
there
with
your
kisses
on
my
lips
oh
i
must
live
somewhere
in
secret
until
you
go
and
then
i
have
put
aside
the
few
things
that
i
want
to
take
i
could
never
have
continued
to
live
with
him
even
if
you
had
said
you
love
me
i
was
obliged
to
pretend
that
i
agreed
to
everything
but
i
will
beg
and
starve
rather
than
bear
that
misery
any
longer
you
love
me
enough
to
face
whatever
may
happen
love
you
with
all
my
soul
monica
sit
down
again
dearest
let
us
talk
about
it
and
see
what
we
can
do
he
half
led
half
carried
her
to
a
couch
and
there
holding
her
embraced
gave
way
to
such
amorous
frenzy
that
again
monica
broke
from
him
you
love
me
she
said
in
tones
of
bitter
distress
will
respect
me
as
much
as
before
i
came
to
you
help
me
i
am
suffering
so
dreadfully
say
at
once
that
i
shall
go
away
with
you
even
if
we
travel
as
strangers
if
you
are
afraid
of
it
becoming
known
i
will
do
everything
to
prevent
it
i
will
go
back
and
live
there
until
tuesday
and
come
away
only
at
the
last
hour
so
that
no
one
will
ever
suspect
where
i
do
care
how
humbly
i
live
when
we
are
abroad
i
can
have
lodgings
somewhere
in
the
same
town
or
near
and
you
will
come
his
hair
disordered
his
eyes
wild
quivering
throughout
with
excitement
he
stood
as
if
pondering
possibilities
i
be
a
burden
to
you
she
asked
in
a
faint
voice
the
expense
more
than
you
no
no
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
but
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
you
could
wait
here
until
i
oh
what
a
wretched
thing
to
have
to
seem
so
cowardly
to
you
but
the
difficulties
are
so
great
darling
i
shall
be
a
perfect
stranger
in
bordeaux
i
do
even
speak
the
language
at
all
well
when
i
reach
there
i
shall
be
met
at
the
station
by
one
of
our
people
and
just
think
how
could
we
manage
you
know
if
it
were
discovered
that
i
had
run
away
with
you
it
would
damage
my
position
terribly
i
ca
say
what
might
happen
my
darling
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
in
a
few
weeks
it
might
all
be
managed
very
easily
i
would
write
to
you
to
some
address
and
as
soon
as
ever
i
had
made
arrangements
monica
broke
down
the
unmanliness
of
his
tone
was
so
dreadful
a
disillusion
she
had
expected
something
so
entirely
different
swift
virile
passion
eagerness
even
to
anticipate
her
desire
of
flight
a
strength
a
courage
to
which
she
could
abandon
herself
body
and
soul
she
broke
down
utterly
and
wept
with
her
hands
upon
her
face
bevis
in
sympathetic
distraction
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
clutching
at
her
waist
do
he
wailed
ca
bear
that
i
will
do
as
you
wish
monica
tell
me
some
place
where
i
can
write
to
you
do
cry
darling
do
she
went
to
the
couch
again
and
rested
her
face
against
the
back
sobbing
for
a
time
they
exchanged
mere
incoherences
then
passion
seized
upon
both
and
they
clung
together
mute
motionless
i
shall
leave
him
whispered
monica
when
at
length
their
eyes
met
will
be
away
in
the
morning
and
i
can
take
what
i
need
tell
me
where
i
shall
go
to
dear
to
wait
until
you
are
ready
no
one
will
ever
suspect
that
we
have
gone
together
he
knows
i
am
miserable
with
him
he
will
believe
that
i
have
found
some
way
of
supporting
myself
in
london
where
shall
i
live
till
tuesday
bevis
scarcely
listened
to
her
words
the
temptation
of
the
natural
man
basely
selfish
was
strengthening
its
hold
upon
him
you
love
me
do
you
really
love
me
he
replied
to
her
with
thick
agitated
utterance
should
you
ask
that
how
can
you
doubt
it
you
really
love
me
his
face
and
tones
frightened
her
make
me
doubt
love
if
i
have
not
perfect
trust
in
you
what
will
become
of
me
yet
once
more
she
drew
resolutely
away
from
him
he
pursued
and
held
her
arms
with
violence
i
am
mistaken
in
you
monica
cried
in
fear
and
bitterness
do
know
what
love
means
as
feel
it
you
wo
speak
you
think
of
our
future
life
together
have
promised
loose
of
me
it
because
i
have
come
here
you
think
me
a
worthless
woman
without
sense
of
honour
with
no
he
protested
vehemently
the
anguished
look
in
her
eyes
had
its
effect
upon
his
senses
by
degrees
it
subjugated
him
and
made
him
ashamed
of
his
ignoble
impulse
i
find
a
lodging
for
you
till
tuesday
he
asked
after
moving
away
and
returning
you
are
sure
you
can
leave
home
without
being
suspected
i
am
sure
i
can
he
is
going
to
the
city
in
the
morning
appoint
some
place
where
i
can
meet
you
i
will
come
in
a
cab
and
then
you
can
take
me
on
to
the
you
are
forgetting
the
risks
if
you
take
a
cab
from
herne
hill
with
your
luggage
he
will
be
able
to
find
out
the
driver
afterwards
and
learn
where
you
went
i
will
drive
only
as
far
as
the
station
and
come
to
victoria
and
you
shall
meet
me
there
the
necessity
of
these
paltry
arrangements
filled
her
soul
with
shame
on
the
details
of
her
escape
she
had
hardly
reflected
all
such
considerations
were
she
deemed
naturally
the
care
of
her
lover
who
would
act
with
promptitude
and
so
as
to
spare
her
a
perplexity
she
had
imagined
everything
in
readiness
within
a
few
hours
on
no
responsibility
save
that
of
breaking
the
hated
bond
inevitably
she
turned
to
the
wretched
thought
that
bevis
regarded
her
as
a
burden
yes
he
had
already
his
mother
and
his
sisters
to
support
she
ought
to
have
remembered
that
time
would
it
be
he
was
asking
unable
to
reply
she
pursued
her
reflections
she
had
money
but
how
to
obtain
possession
of
it
afterwards
when
her
flight
was
accomplished
secrecy
it
appeared
would
be
no
less
needful
than
now
that
necessity
had
never
occurred
to
her
declaration
of
the
love
that
had
freed
her
seemed
inevitable
nay
desirable
her
demanded
it
only
thus
could
she
justify
herself
before
his
sisters
and
other
people
who
knew
her
perhaps
would
not
see
it
in
the
light
of
justification
but
that
mattered
little
her
own
conscience
would
approve
what
she
had
done
but
to
steal
away
and
live
henceforth
in
hiding
like
a
woman
dishonoured
even
in
her
own
eyes
from
that
she
shrank
with
repugnance
rather
than
that
would
it
not
be
preferable
to
break
with
her
husband
and
openly
live
apart
from
him
alone
honest
with
me
she
suddenly
exclaimed
you
rather
i
come
no
i
ca
live
without
you
if
that
is
true
why
have
you
the
courage
to
let
every
one
know
it
in
your
heart
you
must
think
that
we
are
acting
wrongly
do
i
believe
as
you
do
that
love
is
the
only
true
marriage
very
well
he
made
a
desperate
gesture
us
defy
all
consequences
for
your
sake
his
exaggerated
vehemence
could
not
deceive
monica
is
it
she
asked
you
most
fear
he
began
to
babble
protestations
but
she
would
not
listen
to
them
me
i
have
every
right
to
ask
what
you
most
fear
fear
nothing
if
are
with
me
let
my
relatives
say
and
think
what
they
like
i
have
made
great
sacrifices
for
them
to
give
up
would
be
too
much
yet
his
distress
was
evident
it
strained
the
corners
of
his
mouth
wrinkled
his
forehead
disgrace
would
be
more
than
you
could
bear
you
would
never
see
your
mother
and
your
sisters
again
they
are
so
prejudiced
so
unreasonable
i
ca
help
it
they
must
he
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
at
the
outer
door
blanched
herself
monica
saw
that
her
lover
face
turned
to
ghastly
pallor
can
that
be
he
whispered
hoarsely
expect
no
one
you
answer
it
be
have
you
been
followed
does
any
one
suspect
they
stared
at
each
other
still
and
stood
waiting
thus
until
the
knock
was
repeated
impatiently
dare
open
bevis
whispered
coming
close
to
her
as
if
on
the
impulse
of
seeking
protection
for
to
offer
it
was
assuredly
not
in
his
mind
might
be
that
impossible
dare
go
to
the
door
the
risk
is
too
frightful
he
will
go
away
whoever
it
is
if
no
one
answers
both
were
shaking
in
the
second
stage
of
terror
bevis
put
his
arm
about
monica
and
felt
her
heart
give
great
throbs
against
his
own
their
passion
for
the
moment
was
effectually
quenched
that
the
clink
of
the
a
card
or
something
has
been
put
in
then
it
all
right
i
wait
a
moment
he
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
room
opened
it
without
sound
and
at
once
heard
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
in
the
look
which
he
cast
back
at
her
a
grin
rather
than
a
smile
monica
saw
something
that
gave
her
a
pang
of
shame
on
his
behalf
on
going
to
the
he
found
a
card
with
a
few
words
scribbled
upon
it
one
of
our
partners
he
exclaimed
gleefully
to
see
me
of
course
he
took
it
for
granted
i
was
out
monica
was
looking
at
her
watch
past
five
think
i
must
go
she
said
timidly
what
are
our
arrangements
do
you
still
intend
is
it
for
you
to
decide
there
was
a
coldness
in
the
words
of
both
partly
the
result
of
the
great
shock
they
had
undergone
in
part
due
to
their
impatience
with
each
other
do
what
i
proposed
at
first
stay
for
a
few
days
until
i
am
settled
at
bordeaux
with
my
my
husband
she
used
the
word
purposely
significantly
to
see
how
it
would
affect
him
the
bitterness
of
her
growing
disillusion
allowed
her
to
think
and
speak
as
if
no
ardent
feeling
were
concerned
both
our
sakes
dearest
dearest
love
a
few
days
longer
until
i
have
written
to
you
and
told
you
exactly
what
to
do
the
journey
be
very
difficult
for
you
and
think
how
much
better
dear
monica
if
we
can
escape
discovery
and
live
for
each
other
without
any
shame
or
fear
to
disturb
us
you
will
be
my
own
dear
true
wife
i
will
love
and
guard
you
as
long
as
i
live
he
embraced
her
with
placid
tenderness
laying
his
cheek
against
hers
kissing
her
hands
must
see
each
other
again
he
continued
on
sunday
will
you
and
in
the
meantime
find
out
some
place
where
i
could
address
letters
to
you
you
can
always
find
a
stationer
shop
where
they
will
receive
letters
be
guided
by
me
dear
little
girl
only
a
week
or
two
to
save
the
happiness
of
our
whole
lives
monica
listened
but
with
her
look
fixed
on
the
floor
encouraged
by
her
silence
the
lover
went
on
in
a
strain
of
heightening
enthusiasm
depicting
the
raptures
of
their
retirement
from
the
world
in
some
suburb
of
bordeaux
how
this
retreat
was
to
escape
the
notice
of
his
business
companions
through
whom
the
scandal
might
get
wind
he
did
not
suggest
the
truth
was
bevis
found
himself
in
an
extremely
awkward
position
with
issues
he
had
not
contemplated
and
all
he
cared
for
was
to
avert
the
immediate
peril
of
public
discovery
the
kindly
fellow
had
never
considered
all
the
responsibility
involved
in
making
mild
love
timorously
selfish
from
the
first
to
a
married
woman
who
took
his
advances
with
desperate
seriousness
he
had
not
in
him
the
stuff
of
vigorous
rascality
still
less
the
only
other
quality
which
can
support
a
man
in
such
a
situation
as
this
heroism
of
moral
revolt
so
he
cut
a
very
poor
figure
and
was
dolefully
aware
of
it
he
talked
talked
trying
to
disguise
his
feebleness
in
tinsel
phrases
and
monica
still
kept
her
eyes
cast
down
when
another
had
passed
she
sighed
deeply
and
rose
from
her
seat
she
would
write
to
him
she
said
and
let
him
know
where
a
reply
would
reach
her
no
she
must
not
come
here
again
all
he
had
to
tell
her
would
be
communicated
by
letter
the
subdued
tone
the
simple
sadness
of
her
words
distressed
bevis
and
yet
he
secretly
congratulated
himself
he
had
done
nothing
for
which
this
woman
could
justly
reproach
him
marvellous
so
he
considered
had
been
his
absolutely
he
had
behaved
a
gentleman
to
be
sure
he
was
miserably
in
love
and
if
circumstances
by
any
means
allowed
of
it
would
send
for
monica
to
join
him
in
france
should
the
thing
prove
impossible
he
had
nothing
whatever
on
his
conscience
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
monica
shook
her
head
and
looked
away
once
more
that
you
love
me
darling
he
pleaded
shall
not
rest
for
an
hour
until
i
am
able
to
write
and
say
come
to
me
she
permitted
him
to
hold
her
once
more
in
his
soft
embrace
me
monica
she
put
her
lips
to
his
cheek
and
withdrew
them
still
shunning
his
look
not
that
kind
of
kiss
like
you
kissed
me
before
ca
she
replied
with
choking
voice
the
tears
again
starting
forth
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
love
me
less
dearest
he
kissed
the
falling
drops
murmuring
assurances
encouragements
sha
leave
me
until
i
have
heard
you
say
that
your
love
is
unchanged
whisper
it
to
me
sweetest
we
meet
again
not
now
frighten
me
monica
we
are
not
saying
for
ever
you
send
for
me
i
come
promise
faithfully
you
will
come
you
send
for
me
i
will
come
that
was
her
last
word
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
listened
as
she
departed
chapter
xxiii
in
ambush
hitherto
widdowson
had
entertained
no
grave
mistrust
of
his
wife
the
principles
she
had
avowed
directly
traceable
as
it
seemed
to
her
friendship
with
the
militant
women
in
chelsea
he
disliked
and
feared
but
her
conduct
he
fully
believed
to
be
above
reproach
his
jealousy
of
barfoot
did
not
glance
at
monica
attitude
towards
the
man
merely
at
the
man
himself
whom
he
credited
with
native
scoundreldom
barfoot
represented
to
his
mind
a
type
of
licentious
bachelor
why
he
could
not
have
made
perfectly
clear
to
his
own
understanding
possibly
the
ease
of
everard
bearing
the
something
aristocratic
in
his
countenance
and
his
speech
the
polish
of
his
manner
especially
in
formal
converse
with
women
from
the
first
gave
offence
to
essentially
sensibilities
if
monica
were
in
danger
at
all
it
was
he
felt
convinced
from
that
quarter
the
subject
of
his
wife
intimate
dialogue
with
barfoot
at
the
academy
still
remained
a
mystery
to
him
he
put
faith
in
her
rebellious
declaration
that
every
word
might
have
been
safely
repeated
in
his
hearing
but
be
the
matter
what
it
might
the
manner
of
barfoot
talk
meant
evil
of
that
conviction
he
could
not
get
rid
he
had
read
somewhere
that
a
persistently
jealous
husband
may
not
improbably
end
by
irritating
an
innocent
wife
into
affording
real
ground
for
jealousy
a
man
with
small
knowledge
of
the
world
is
much
impressed
by
dicta
such
as
these
they
get
into
the
crannies
of
his
mind
and
thence
direct
the
course
of
his
thinking
widdowson
before
his
marriage
had
never
suspected
the
difficulty
of
understanding
a
woman
had
he
spoken
his
serious
belief
on
that
subject
it
would
have
been
found
to
represent
the
most
primitive
male
conception
of
the
feminine
being
women
were
very
like
children
it
was
rather
a
task
to
amuse
them
and
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
therefore
the
blessedness
of
household
toil
in
especial
the
blessedness
of
and
all
that
followed
intimacy
with
monica
had
greatly
affected
his
views
yet
chiefly
by
disturbing
them
no
firmer
ground
offered
itself
to
his
treading
when
he
perforce
admitted
that
his
former
standpoint
was
every
day
assailed
by
some
incontestable
piece
of
evidence
woman
had
individual
characters
that
discovery
though
not
a
very
profound
one
impressed
him
with
the
force
of
something
arrived
at
by
independent
observation
monica
often
puzzled
him
gravely
he
could
not
find
the
key
to
her
satisfactions
and
discontents
to
regard
her
simply
as
a
human
being
was
beyond
the
reach
of
his
intelligence
he
cast
the
blame
of
his
difficulties
upon
sex
and
paid
more
attention
to
the
hints
on
such
topics
afforded
him
by
his
reading
he
would
endeavour
to
keep
his
jealousy
out
of
sight
lest
the
mysterious
tendency
of
the
female
nature
might
prompt
monica
to
deliberate
wrongdoing
for
the
first
time
there
flashed
across
him
the
thought
that
already
he
might
have
been
deceived
it
originated
in
a
peculiarity
of
monica
behaviour
at
luncheon
she
ate
scarcely
anything
she
seemed
hurried
frequently
glancing
at
the
clock
and
she
lost
herself
in
reverie
discovering
that
his
eye
was
upon
her
she
betrayed
uneasiness
and
began
to
talk
without
considering
what
she
meant
to
say
all
this
might
mean
nothing
more
than
her
regret
at
being
obliged
to
leave
london
but
widdowson
remarked
it
with
a
vivacity
of
feeling
perhaps
due
to
the
excitement
in
which
he
had
lived
for
the
past
week
perhaps
the
activity
the
resolution
to
which
he
had
urged
himself
caused
a
sharpening
of
his
perceptions
and
the
very
thought
never
out
of
his
mind
that
only
a
few
days
had
to
elapse
before
he
carried
off
his
wife
from
the
scene
of
peril
tended
to
make
him
more
vividly
conscious
of
that
peril
certain
it
was
that
a
moment
clairvoyance
assailed
his
peace
and
left
behind
it
all
manner
of
ugly
conjectures
women
so
said
the
books
are
adepts
at
dissimulation
was
it
conceivable
that
monica
had
taken
advantage
of
the
liberty
he
had
of
late
allowed
her
if
a
woman
could
not
endure
a
direct
searching
gaze
must
it
not
imply
some
enormous
wickedness
seeing
that
nature
has
armed
them
for
this
very
trial
in
her
setting
forth
for
the
railway
station
hurry
was
again
evident
and
disinclination
to
exchange
parting
words
if
the
eagerness
were
simple
and
honest
would
she
not
have
accepted
his
suggestion
and
have
gone
in
the
morning
for
five
minutes
after
her
departure
he
stood
in
the
hall
staring
before
him
a
new
jealousy
a
horrible
constriction
of
the
heart
had
begun
to
torture
him
he
went
and
walked
about
in
the
library
but
could
not
dispel
his
suffering
vain
to
keep
repeating
that
monica
was
incapable
of
baseness
of
that
he
was
persuaded
but
none
the
less
a
hideous
image
returned
upon
his
mental
vision
a
horror
a
pollution
of
thought
one
thing
he
could
do
to
restore
his
sanity
he
would
walk
over
to
lavender
hill
and
accompany
his
wife
on
her
return
home
indeed
the
mere
difficulty
of
getting
through
the
afternoon
advised
this
project
he
could
not
employ
himself
and
knew
that
his
imagination
once
inflamed
would
leave
him
not
a
moment
rest
yes
he
would
walk
to
lavender
hill
and
ramble
about
that
region
until
monica
had
had
reasonable
time
for
talk
with
her
sister
about
three
there
fell
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
strangely
against
his
habits
widdowson
turned
into
a
quiet
and
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
bar
drinking
a
glass
of
whisky
during
the
past
week
he
had
taken
considerably
more
wine
than
usual
at
meals
he
seemed
to
need
the
support
whilst
sipping
at
his
glass
of
spirits
he
oddly
enough
fell
into
talk
with
the
barmaid
a
young
woman
of
some
charms
and
what
appeared
to
be
unaffected
modesty
not
for
twenty
years
had
widdowson
conversed
with
a
member
of
this
sisterhood
their
dialogue
was
made
up
of
the
most
trifling
of
trivialities
weather
a
railway
accident
the
desirability
of
holidays
at
this
season
and
when
at
length
he
rose
and
put
an
end
to
the
chat
it
was
with
appreciable
reluctance
good
nice
sort
of
girl
he
went
away
saying
to
himself
she
should
be
serving
at
a
bar
hearing
doubtful
talk
and
seeing
very
often
vile
sights
a
nice
little
girl
and
he
mused
upon
her
remembered
face
with
a
complacency
which
soothed
his
feelings
of
a
sudden
he
was
checked
by
the
conversion
of
his
sentiment
into
thought
would
he
not
have
been
a
much
happier
man
if
he
had
married
a
girl
distinctly
his
inferior
in
mind
and
station
provided
she
were
sweet
lovable
docile
such
a
wife
would
have
spared
him
all
the
misery
he
had
known
with
monica
from
the
first
he
had
understood
that
monica
was
no
representative
shopgirl
and
on
that
very
account
he
had
striven
so
eagerly
to
win
her
but
it
was
a
mistake
he
had
loved
her
still
loved
her
with
all
the
emotion
of
which
he
was
capable
how
many
hours
genuine
happiness
of
soul
had
that
love
afforded
him
the
minutest
fraction
of
the
twelve
months
for
which
she
had
been
his
wife
and
of
suffering
often
amounting
to
frantic
misery
he
could
count
many
weeks
could
such
a
marriage
as
this
be
judged
a
marriage
at
all
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
me
ask
myself
a
question
if
monica
were
absolutely
free
to
choose
between
continuing
to
live
with
me
and
resuming
her
perfect
liberty
can
i
persuade
myself
that
she
would
remain
my
wife
she
would
not
not
for
a
day
not
for
an
hour
of
that
i
am
morally
convinced
and
i
acknowledge
the
grounds
of
her
dissatisfaction
we
are
unsuited
to
each
other
we
do
not
understand
each
other
our
marriage
is
physical
and
nothing
more
my
love
what
is
my
love
i
do
not
love
her
mind
her
intellectual
part
if
i
did
this
frightful
jealousy
from
which
i
suffer
would
be
impossible
my
ideal
of
the
wife
perfectly
suited
to
me
is
far
liker
that
girl
at
the
bar
than
monica
independence
of
thought
is
a
perpetual
irritation
to
me
i
do
know
what
her
thoughts
really
are
what
her
intellectual
life
signifies
and
yet
i
hold
her
to
me
with
the
sternest
grasp
if
she
endeavoured
to
release
herself
i
should
feel
capable
of
killing
her
is
not
this
a
strange
a
brutal
thing
widdowson
had
never
before
reached
this
height
of
speculation
in
the
moment
by
the
very
fact
of
admitting
that
monica
and
he
ought
not
to
be
living
together
he
became
more
worthy
of
his
wife
companionship
than
ever
hitherto
well
he
would
exercise
greater
forbearance
he
would
endeavour
to
win
her
respect
by
respecting
the
freedom
she
claimed
his
recent
suspicions
of
her
were
monstrous
if
she
knew
them
how
her
soul
would
revolt
from
him
what
if
she
took
an
interest
in
other
men
perchance
more
her
equals
than
he
why
had
he
not
just
been
thinking
of
another
woman
reflecting
that
she
or
one
like
her
would
have
made
him
a
more
suitable
wife
than
monica
yet
this
could
not
reasonably
be
called
unfaithfulness
they
were
bound
together
for
life
and
their
wisdom
lay
in
mutual
toleration
the
constant
endeavour
to
understand
each
other
aright
not
in
fierce
restraint
of
each
other
mental
liberty
how
many
marriages
were
anything
more
than
mutual
forbearance
perhaps
there
ought
not
to
be
such
a
thing
as
enforced
permanence
of
marriage
this
was
daring
speculation
he
could
not
have
endured
to
hear
it
from
monica
lips
but
perhaps
some
day
marriage
would
be
dissoluble
at
the
will
of
either
party
to
it
perhaps
the
man
who
sought
to
hold
a
woman
when
she
no
longer
loved
him
would
be
regarded
with
contempt
and
condemnation
what
a
simple
thing
marriage
had
always
seemed
to
him
and
how
far
from
simple
he
had
found
it
why
it
led
him
to
musings
which
overset
the
order
of
the
world
and
flung
all
ideas
of
religion
and
morality
into
wildest
confusion
it
would
not
do
to
think
like
this
he
was
a
man
wedded
to
a
woman
very
difficult
to
manage
there
was
the
practical
upshot
of
the
matter
his
duty
was
to
manage
her
he
was
responsible
for
her
right
conduct
with
intentions
perfectly
harmless
she
might
run
into
unknown
jeopardy
above
all
just
at
this
time
when
she
was
taking
reluctant
leave
of
her
friends
the
danger
justified
him
in
exceptional
vigilance
so
from
his
excursion
into
the
realms
of
reason
did
he
return
to
the
safe
sphere
of
the
commonplace
and
now
he
might
venture
to
press
on
towards
conisbee
house
for
it
was
four
and
already
monica
must
have
been
talking
with
her
sister
for
a
couple
of
hours
his
knock
at
the
door
was
answered
by
the
landlady
herself
she
told
of
widdowson
arrival
and
departure
ah
then
monica
had
no
doubt
gone
straight
home
again
but
as
miss
madden
had
returned
he
would
speak
with
her
poor
lady
is
very
well
sir
said
conisbee
fingering
the
hem
of
her
apron
very
well
but
could
i
see
her
for
a
moment
virginia
answered
this
question
by
appearing
on
the
staircase
one
for
me
mrs
conisbee
she
called
from
above
is
it
edmund
so
very
glad
i
sure
conisbee
will
have
the
kindness
to
let
you
come
into
her
what
a
pity
i
was
away
when
monica
called
i
had
business
to
see
to
in
town
and
walked
and
walked
until
i
really
hardly
able
she
sank
upon
a
chair
in
the
room
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
visitor
with
a
broad
benevolent
smile
her
head
moving
up
and
down
widdowson
was
for
a
moment
in
perplexity
if
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
could
be
trusted
miss
madden
indisposition
pointed
to
a
cause
so
strange
that
it
seemed
incredible
he
turned
to
look
for
conisbee
but
the
landlady
had
hurriedly
withdrawn
closing
the
door
behind
her
is
so
foolish
of
me
edmund
virginia
rambled
on
addressing
him
with
a
familiarity
she
had
never
yet
used
i
am
away
from
home
i
forget
all
about
my
meals
really
forget
and
then
all
at
once
i
find
that
i
am
quite
exhausted
quite
exhausted
as
you
see
and
the
worst
of
it
is
i
have
altogether
lost
my
appetite
by
the
time
i
get
back
i
could
eat
a
mouthful
of
food
not
a
mouthful
i
assure
you
i
could
and
it
does
so
distress
good
conisbee
she
is
exceedingly
kind
to
me
exceedingly
careful
about
my
health
oh
and
in
battersea
park
road
i
saw
such
a
shocking
sight
a
great
cart
ran
over
a
poor
little
dog
and
it
was
killed
on
the
spot
it
unnerved
me
dreadfully
i
do
think
edmund
those
drivers
ought
to
be
more
careful
i
was
saying
to
conisbee
only
the
other
day
and
that
reminds
me
i
do
so
want
to
know
all
about
your
visit
to
clevedon
dear
dear
clevedon
and
have
you
really
taken
a
house
there
edmund
oh
if
we
could
all
end
our
days
at
clevedon
you
know
that
our
dear
father
and
mother
are
buried
in
the
old
churchyard
you
remember
tennyson
lines
about
the
old
church
at
clevedon
oh
and
what
did
monica
decide
about
about
really
what
i
going
to
ask
it
is
so
foolish
of
me
to
forget
that
has
come
and
gone
i
get
so
exhausted
and
even
my
memory
fails
me
he
could
doubt
no
longer
this
poor
woman
had
yielded
to
one
of
the
temptations
that
beset
a
life
of
idleness
and
solitude
his
pity
was
mingled
with
disgust
only
wished
to
tell
you
he
said
gravely
we
have
taken
a
house
at
clevedon
really
she
clasped
her
hands
together
dial
hill
virginia
began
a
rhapsody
which
her
had
no
inclination
to
hear
he
rose
abruptly
you
had
better
come
and
see
us
monica
left
a
message
that
she
would
be
at
home
for
the
next
few
days
and
that
i
was
to
come
till
i
heard
from
her
at
home
i
think
there
a
mistake
impossible
we
ask
mrs
conisbee
she
went
to
the
door
and
called
from
the
landlady
widdowson
learnt
exactly
what
monica
had
said
he
reflected
for
a
moment
shall
write
to
you
then
do
come
just
yet
i
must
stay
any
longer
now
and
with
a
mere
pretence
of
shaking
hands
he
abruptly
left
the
house
suspicions
thickened
about
him
he
would
have
thought
it
utterly
impossible
for
miss
madden
to
disgrace
herself
in
this
vulgar
way
and
the
appalling
discovery
affected
his
view
of
monica
they
were
sisters
they
had
characteristics
in
common
family
traits
weaknesses
if
the
elder
woman
could
fall
into
this
degradation
might
there
not
be
possibilities
in
monica
character
such
as
he
had
refused
to
contemplate
was
there
not
terrible
reason
for
mistrusting
her
what
did
she
mean
by
her
message
to
virginia
black
and
haggard
he
went
home
as
fast
as
a
hansom
could
take
him
it
was
five
when
he
reached
the
house
his
wife
was
not
here
and
had
not
been
here
at
this
moment
monica
was
starting
by
train
from
bayswater
after
her
parting
with
bevis
arrived
at
victoria
she
crossed
to
the
main
station
and
went
to
the
ladies
for
the
purpose
of
bathing
her
face
she
had
red
swollen
eyes
and
her
hair
was
in
slight
disorder
this
done
she
inquired
as
to
the
next
train
for
herne
hill
one
had
just
gone
another
would
leave
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
dreadful
indecision
was
harassing
her
ought
she
did
she
dare
to
return
home
at
all
even
if
her
strength
sufficed
for
simulating
a
natural
manner
could
she
consent
to
play
so
base
a
part
there
was
but
one
possible
alternative
she
might
go
to
lodgings
and
there
remain
writing
to
her
husband
that
she
had
left
him
the
true
cause
need
not
be
confessed
she
would
merely
declare
that
life
with
him
had
become
intolerable
to
her
that
she
demanded
a
release
their
approaching
removal
to
clevedon
offered
the
occasion
she
would
say
that
her
endurance
failed
before
that
prospect
of
solitude
and
that
feeling
as
she
did
it
was
dishonourable
to
make
longer
pretence
of
doing
her
duty
as
a
wife
then
if
bevis
wrote
to
her
in
such
a
way
as
to
revive
her
love
if
he
seriously
told
her
to
come
to
him
all
difficulties
could
be
solved
by
her
disappearance
was
such
revival
of
disheartened
love
a
likely
or
a
possible
thing
at
this
moment
she
felt
that
to
flee
in
secret
and
live
with
bevis
as
he
proposed
would
be
no
less
dishonour
than
abiding
with
the
man
who
had
a
legal
claim
upon
her
companionship
her
lover
as
she
had
thought
of
him
for
the
past
two
or
three
months
was
only
a
figment
of
her
imagination
bevis
had
proved
himself
a
complete
stranger
to
her
mind
she
must
reshape
her
knowledge
of
him
his
face
was
all
that
she
could
still
dwell
upon
with
the
old
desire
nay
even
that
had
suffered
a
change
insensibly
the
minutes
went
by
whilst
she
sat
in
the
her
train
started
and
when
she
had
become
aware
of
that
her
irresolution
grew
more
tormenting
suddenly
there
came
upon
her
a
feeling
of
illness
of
nausea
perspiration
broke
out
on
her
forehead
her
eyes
dazzled
she
had
to
let
her
head
fall
back
it
passed
but
in
a
minute
or
two
the
fit
again
seized
her
and
with
a
moan
she
lost
consciousness
two
or
three
women
who
were
in
the
room
rendered
assistance
the
remarks
they
exchanged
though
expressing
uncertainty
and
discreetly
ambiguous
would
have
been
significant
to
monica
on
her
recovery
which
took
place
in
a
few
moments
she
at
once
started
up
and
with
hurried
thanks
to
those
about
her
listening
to
nothing
that
was
said
and
answering
no
inquiry
went
out
on
to
the
platform
there
was
just
time
to
catch
the
train
now
departing
for
herne
hill
she
explained
her
fainting
fit
by
the
hours
of
agitation
through
which
she
had
passed
there
was
no
room
for
surprise
she
had
suffered
indescribably
and
still
suffered
her
wish
was
to
get
back
into
the
quietness
of
home
to
rest
and
to
lose
herself
in
sleep
on
entering
she
saw
nothing
of
her
husband
his
hat
hung
on
the
and
he
was
perhaps
sitting
in
the
library
the
more
genial
temper
would
account
for
his
not
coming
forth
at
once
to
meet
her
as
had
been
his
custom
when
she
returned
from
an
absence
alone
she
changed
her
dress
and
disguised
as
far
as
was
possible
the
traces
of
suffering
on
her
features
weakness
and
tremor
urged
her
to
lie
down
but
she
could
not
venture
to
do
this
until
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband
supporting
herself
by
the
banisters
she
slowly
descended
and
opened
the
library
door
widdowson
was
reading
a
newspaper
he
did
not
look
round
but
said
carelessly
you
are
back
i
hope
you
did
expect
me
sooner
it
all
right
he
threw
a
rapid
glance
at
her
over
his
shoulder
a
long
talk
with
virginia
i
suppose
i
could
get
away
before
widdowson
seemed
to
be
much
interested
in
some
paragraph
he
put
his
face
closer
to
the
paper
and
was
silent
for
two
or
three
seconds
then
he
again
looked
round
this
time
observing
his
wife
steadily
but
with
a
face
that
gave
no
intimation
of
unusual
thoughts
she
consent
to
go
monica
replied
that
it
was
still
uncertain
she
thought
however
that
virginia
objections
would
be
overcome
look
very
tired
remarked
the
other
am
very
and
thereupon
she
withdrew
unable
to
command
her
countenance
scarce
able
to
remain
standing
for
another
moment
chapter
xxiv
tracked
when
widdowson
went
up
to
the
bedroom
that
night
monica
was
already
asleep
he
discovered
this
on
turning
up
the
gas
the
light
fell
upon
her
face
and
he
was
drawn
to
the
bedside
to
look
at
her
the
features
signified
nothing
but
repose
her
lips
were
just
apart
her
eyelids
lay
softly
with
their
black
fringe
of
exquisite
pencilling
and
her
hair
was
arranged
as
she
always
prepared
it
for
the
pillow
he
watched
her
for
full
five
minutes
and
detected
not
the
slightest
movement
so
profound
was
her
sleep
then
he
turned
away
muttering
savagely
under
his
breath
liar
but
for
a
purpose
in
his
thoughts
he
would
not
have
lain
down
beside
her
on
getting
into
bed
he
kept
as
far
away
as
possible
and
all
through
the
wakeful
night
his
limbs
shrank
from
the
touch
of
hers
he
rose
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
monica
had
long
been
awake
but
she
moved
so
seldom
that
he
could
not
be
sure
of
this
her
face
was
turned
from
him
when
he
came
back
to
the
room
after
his
bath
monica
propped
herself
on
her
elbow
and
asked
why
he
was
moving
so
early
want
to
be
in
the
city
at
nine
he
replied
with
a
show
of
cheerfulness
a
money
affair
i
must
see
after
that
going
wrong
afraid
so
i
must
lose
no
time
in
looking
to
it
what
plans
have
you
for
whatever
saturday
you
know
i
promised
to
see
newdick
this
afternoon
perhaps
i
may
bring
him
to
dinner
about
twelve
he
returned
from
his
business
at
two
he
went
away
again
saying
that
he
should
not
be
back
before
seven
it
might
be
a
little
later
in
monica
these
movements
excited
no
special
remark
they
were
merely
a
continuance
of
his
restlessness
but
no
sooner
had
he
departed
after
luncheon
than
she
went
to
her
and
began
to
make
slow
uncertain
preparations
for
leaving
home
herself
this
morning
she
had
tried
to
write
a
letter
for
bevis
but
vainly
she
knew
not
what
to
say
to
him
uncertain
of
her
own
desires
and
of
what
lay
before
her
yet
if
she
were
to
communicate
with
him
henceforth
at
all
it
was
necessary
this
very
afternoon
to
find
an
address
where
letters
could
be
received
for
her
and
to
let
him
know
of
it
sunday
was
useless
for
the
purpose
and
on
monday
it
might
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
out
alone
besides
that
she
could
not
be
sure
of
the
safety
of
a
letter
delivered
at
the
flat
on
monday
night
or
tuesday
morning
she
dressed
at
length
and
went
out
her
wisest
course
probably
was
to
seek
for
some
obliging
shopkeeper
near
lavender
hill
then
she
could
call
on
virginia
transact
the
business
she
had
pretended
to
discharge
yesterday
and
there
pen
a
note
to
bevis
her
moods
alternated
with
distracting
rapidity
a
hundred
times
she
had
resolved
that
bevis
could
be
nothing
more
to
her
and
again
had
thought
of
him
with
impulses
of
yearning
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
he
had
acted
well
and
wisely
a
hundred
times
she
determined
to
carry
out
her
idea
of
yesterday
to
quit
her
husband
and
resist
all
his
efforts
to
recall
her
and
again
had
all
but
resigned
herself
to
live
with
him
accepting
degradation
as
so
many
wives
perforce
did
her
mind
was
in
confusion
and
physically
she
felt
far
from
well
a
heaviness
weighed
upon
her
limbs
making
it
hardship
to
walk
however
short
a
distance
arrived
at
clapham
junction
she
began
to
search
wearily
indifferently
for
the
kind
of
shop
that
might
answer
her
purpose
the
receiving
of
letters
which
for
one
reason
or
another
must
be
dispatched
to
a
secret
address
is
a
very
ordinary
complaisance
on
the
part
of
small
london
stationers
hundreds
of
such
letters
are
sent
and
called
for
every
week
within
the
metropolitan
postal
area
it
did
not
take
monica
long
to
find
an
obliging
shopkeeper
the
first
to
whom
she
applied
a
decent
woman
behind
a
counter
which
displayed
newspapers
tobacco
and
fancy
articles
willingly
accepted
the
commission
she
came
out
of
the
shop
with
flushed
cheeks
another
step
in
shameful
descent
yet
it
had
the
result
of
strengthening
once
more
her
emotions
favourable
to
bevis
on
his
account
she
had
braved
this
ignominy
and
it
drew
her
towards
him
instead
of
producing
the
effect
which
would
have
seemed
more
natural
perhaps
the
reason
was
that
she
felt
herself
more
hopelessly
an
outcast
from
the
world
of
honourable
women
and
therefore
longed
in
her
desolation
for
the
support
of
a
man
love
did
he
not
love
her
it
was
fault
if
she
expected
him
to
act
with
a
boldness
that
did
not
lie
in
his
nature
perhaps
his
discretion
which
she
had
so
bitterly
condemned
as
weakness
meant
a
wise
regard
for
her
interests
as
well
as
his
own
the
public
scandal
of
divorce
was
a
hideous
thing
if
it
damaged
his
prospects
and
sundered
him
from
his
relatives
how
could
she
hope
that
his
love
of
her
the
cause
of
it
all
would
long
endure
the
need
of
love
overcame
her
she
would
submit
to
any
conditions
rather
than
lose
this
lover
whose
kisses
were
upon
her
lips
and
whose
arms
had
held
her
so
passionately
she
was
too
young
to
accept
a
life
of
resignation
too
ardent
why
had
she
left
him
in
despondency
in
doubt
whether
he
would
ever
again
see
her
she
turned
back
on
her
way
to
virginia
lodgings
the
station
and
journeyed
townwards
it
was
an
odd
incident
by
monica
unperceived
that
when
she
was
taking
her
ticket
there
stood
close
by
her
a
man
seemingly
a
mechanic
who
had
also
stood
within
hearing
when
she
booked
at
herne
hill
this
same
man
though
he
had
not
travelled
in
the
compartment
with
her
followed
her
when
she
alighted
at
bayswater
she
did
not
once
observe
him
instead
of
writing
she
had
resolved
to
see
bevis
again
if
it
were
possible
perhaps
he
would
not
be
at
the
flat
yet
his
wish
might
suggest
the
bare
hope
of
her
coming
the
risk
of
meeting
barfoot
probably
need
not
be
considered
for
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
travelling
into
cumberland
and
for
so
long
a
journey
he
would
be
sure
to
set
forth
in
the
morning
at
worst
she
would
suffer
a
disappointment
indulgence
of
her
fervid
feelings
had
made
her
as
eager
to
see
bevis
as
she
was
yesterday
words
of
tenderness
rushed
to
her
lips
for
utterance
when
she
reached
the
building
all
but
delirium
possessed
her
she
had
hurried
up
to
the
first
landing
when
a
footstep
behind
drew
her
attention
it
was
a
man
in
mechanic
dress
coming
up
with
head
bent
doubtless
for
some
task
or
other
in
one
of
the
flats
perhaps
he
was
going
to
bevis
she
went
forward
more
slowly
and
on
the
next
landing
allowed
the
man
to
pass
her
yes
more
likely
than
not
he
was
engaged
in
packing
her
lover
furniture
she
stood
still
at
that
moment
a
door
closed
above
and
another
step
lighter
and
quicker
that
of
a
woman
came
downstairs
as
far
as
her
ear
could
judge
this
person
might
have
left
bevis
flat
a
conflict
of
emotions
excited
her
to
panic
she
was
afraid
either
to
advance
or
to
retreat
and
in
equal
dread
of
standing
without
purpose
she
stepped
up
to
the
nearest
door
and
gave
a
summons
with
the
knocker
this
door
was
barfoot
she
knew
that
in
the
first
instant
of
fear
occasioned
by
the
workman
approach
she
had
glanced
at
the
door
and
reminded
herself
that
here
barfoot
dwelt
immediately
beneath
bevis
but
for
the
wild
alarm
due
to
her
state
she
could
not
have
risked
the
possibility
of
the
tenant
being
still
at
home
and
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
doing
the
only
thing
possible
under
the
circumstances
for
this
woman
whom
she
heard
just
above
might
perchance
be
one
of
bevis
sisters
returned
to
london
for
some
purpose
or
other
and
in
that
case
she
preferred
being
seen
at
barfoot
door
to
detection
as
she
made
for
her
lover
uncertainty
on
this
point
lasted
but
a
few
seconds
dreading
to
look
at
the
woman
monica
yet
did
so
just
as
she
passed
and
beheld
the
face
of
a
perfect
stranger
a
young
and
face
however
her
mind
sufficiently
tumultuous
received
a
new
impulse
of
disturbance
had
this
woman
come
forth
from
bevis
fiat
or
from
the
one
opposite
for
on
each
floor
there
were
two
dwellings
in
the
meantime
no
one
answered
her
knock
barfoot
had
gone
she
breathed
thankfully
now
she
might
venture
to
ascend
to
the
next
floor
but
then
sounded
a
knock
from
above
that
she
felt
convinced
was
at
bevis
door
and
if
so
her
conjecture
about
the
workman
was
correct
she
stood
waiting
for
certainty
as
if
still
expecting
a
reply
to
her
own
signal
at
barfoot
door
the
mechanic
looked
down
at
her
over
the
banisters
but
of
this
she
was
unaware
the
knock
above
was
repeated
yes
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
it
was
on
this
side
of
the
landing
that
is
to
say
at
her
door
but
the
door
did
not
open
thus
without
going
up
herself
she
received
assurance
that
bevis
was
not
at
home
he
might
come
later
she
still
had
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
so
as
if
disappointed
in
a
call
at
barfoot
she
descended
the
stairs
and
issued
into
the
street
agitation
had
exhausted
her
and
a
dazzling
of
her
eyes
threatened
a
recurrence
of
yesterday
faintness
she
found
a
shop
where
refreshments
were
sold
and
sat
for
half
an
hour
over
a
cup
of
tea
trying
to
amuse
herself
with
illustrated
papers
the
mechanic
who
had
knocked
at
bevis
door
passed
once
or
twice
along
the
pavement
and
as
long
as
she
remained
here
kept
the
shop
within
sight
at
length
she
asked
for
writing
materials
and
penned
a
few
lines
if
on
her
second
attempt
she
failed
to
see
bevis
she
would
drop
this
note
into
his
it
acquainted
him
with
the
address
to
which
he
might
direct
letters
assured
him
passionately
of
her
love
and
implored
him
to
be
true
to
her
to
send
for
her
as
soon
as
circumstances
made
it
possible
of
every
kind
was
natural
to
her
position
though
the
relief
of
escaping
from
several
distinct
dangers
had
put
her
mind
comparatively
at
ease
for
a
short
time
she
had
now
begun
to
suffer
a
fresh
uneasiness
with
reference
to
the
young
and
handsome
woman
who
came
downstairs
the
fact
that
no
one
answered
the
workman
knock
had
seemed
to
her
a
sufficient
proof
that
bevis
was
not
at
home
and
that
the
stranger
must
have
come
forth
from
the
flat
opposite
his
but
she
recollected
the
incident
which
had
so
alarmingly
disturbed
her
and
her
lover
yesterday
bevis
did
not
then
go
to
the
door
and
suppose
oh
it
was
folly
but
suppose
that
woman
had
been
with
him
suppose
he
did
not
care
to
open
to
a
visitor
whose
signal
sounded
only
a
minute
or
two
after
that
person
departure
had
she
not
anguish
enough
to
endure
without
the
addition
of
frantic
jealousy
she
would
not
give
another
thought
to
such
absurd
suggestions
the
woman
had
of
course
come
from
the
dwelling
opposite
yet
why
might
she
not
have
been
in
bevis
flat
when
he
himself
was
absent
suppose
her
an
intimate
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
a
if
any
such
connection
existed
might
it
not
help
to
explain
to
think
thus
was
courting
madness
unable
to
sit
still
any
longer
monica
left
the
shop
and
strayed
for
some
ten
minutes
about
the
neighbouring
streets
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
goal
finally
she
entered
the
building
and
went
upstairs
on
this
occasion
no
one
met
her
and
no
one
entered
in
her
rear
she
knocked
at
her
lover
door
and
stood
longing
praying
that
it
might
open
but
it
did
not
tears
started
to
her
eyes
she
uttered
a
moan
of
bitterest
disappointment
and
slipped
the
envelope
she
was
carrying
into
the
the
mechanic
had
seen
her
go
in
and
he
waited
outside
a
few
yards
away
either
she
would
soon
reappear
or
her
not
doing
so
would
show
that
she
had
obtained
admittance
somewhere
in
the
latter
case
this
workman
of
much
curiosity
and
leisure
had
only
to
lurk
about
the
staircase
until
she
came
forth
again
but
this
trial
of
patience
was
spared
him
he
found
that
he
had
simply
to
follow
the
lady
back
to
herne
hill
acting
on
very
suggestive
instructions
it
never
occurred
to
the
worthy
man
that
the
lady
second
visit
was
not
to
the
same
flat
as
in
the
former
instance
monica
was
home
again
long
before
when
that
hour
arrived
her
husband
had
not
yet
come
the
delay
no
doubt
was
somehow
connected
with
his
visit
to
newdick
but
this
went
on
at
nine
monica
still
sat
alone
hungry
yet
scarce
conscious
of
hunger
owing
to
her
miseries
widdowson
had
never
behaved
thus
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
she
heard
the
front
door
open
he
came
to
the
where
she
sat
waiting
late
you
are
are
you
alone
alone
have
had
dinner
he
seemed
to
be
in
rather
a
gloomy
mood
but
monica
noticed
nothing
that
alarmed
her
he
was
drawing
nearer
his
eyes
on
the
ground
you
had
bad
news
in
the
city
i
have
still
he
came
nearer
and
at
length
when
a
yard
or
two
away
raised
his
look
to
her
face
you
been
out
this
afternoon
she
was
prompted
to
a
falsehood
but
durst
not
utter
it
so
keenly
was
he
regarding
her
i
went
to
see
miss
barfoot
as
the
word
burst
from
his
lips
he
sprang
at
her
clutched
her
dress
at
the
throat
and
flung
her
violently
upon
her
knees
a
short
cry
of
terror
escaped
her
then
she
was
stricken
dumb
with
eyes
starting
and
mouth
open
it
was
well
that
he
held
her
by
the
garment
and
not
by
the
neck
for
his
hand
closed
with
murderous
convulsion
and
the
desire
of
crushing
out
her
life
was
for
an
instant
all
his
consciousness
again
burst
from
him
after
day
you
have
lied
to
me
liar
adultress
am
not
i
am
not
that
she
clung
upon
his
arms
and
strove
to
raise
herself
the
bloodless
lips
the
choked
voice
meant
dread
of
him
but
the
distortion
of
her
features
was
hatred
and
the
will
to
resist
that
what
is
your
word
worth
the
prostitute
in
the
street
is
sooner
to
be
believed
she
has
the
honesty
to
say
what
she
is
but
you
where
were
you
yesterday
when
you
were
not
at
your
sister
where
were
you
this
afternoon
she
had
nearly
struggled
to
her
feet
he
thrust
her
down
again
crushed
her
backwards
until
her
head
all
but
touched
the
floor
were
you
tell
the
truth
or
you
shall
never
speak
again
help
help
he
will
kill
me
her
cry
rang
through
the
room
them
up
let
them
come
and
look
at
you
and
hear
what
you
are
soon
enough
every
one
will
know
where
were
you
this
afternoon
you
were
watched
every
step
of
the
way
from
here
to
that
place
where
you
have
made
yourself
a
base
vile
unclean
creature
am
not
that
your
spies
have
misled
you
did
you
go
to
that
man
barfoot
door
and
knock
there
and
because
you
were
disappointed
did
you
wait
about
and
go
there
a
second
time
if
i
did
it
does
mean
what
you
think
you
go
time
after
time
to
the
private
chambers
of
an
unmarried
man
a
man
such
as
that
and
it
means
no
harm
have
never
been
there
before
expect
me
to
believe
you
widdowson
cried
with
savage
contumely
he
had
just
loosed
his
hold
of
her
and
she
was
upright
again
before
him
her
eyes
flashing
defiance
though
every
muscle
in
her
frame
quivered
did
your
lies
begin
was
it
when
you
told
me
you
had
been
to
hear
miss
barfoot
lecture
and
never
went
there
at
all
he
aimed
the
charge
at
a
venture
and
her
face
told
him
that
his
suspicion
had
been
grounded
how
many
weeks
for
how
many
months
have
you
been
dishonouring
me
and
yourself
am
not
guilty
of
what
you
believe
but
i
sha
try
to
defend
myself
thank
heaven
this
is
the
end
of
everything
between
us
charge
me
with
what
you
like
i
am
going
away
from
you
and
i
hope
we
may
never
meet
again
you
are
going
no
doubt
of
that
but
not
before
you
have
answered
my
questions
whether
with
lies
or
not
does
matter
much
you
shall
give
your
own
account
of
what
you
have
been
doing
both
panting
as
if
after
some
supreme
effort
of
their
physical
force
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
each
to
the
other
eyes
was
incredibly
transformed
monica
could
not
have
imagined
such
brutal
ferocity
in
her
husband
face
and
she
herself
had
a
wild
recklessness
in
her
eyes
a
scorn
and
abhorrence
in
all
the
lines
of
her
countenance
which
made
widdowson
feel
as
if
a
stranger
were
before
him
shall
answer
no
question
whatever
monica
replied
i
want
is
to
leave
your
house
and
never
see
you
again
he
regretted
what
he
had
done
the
result
of
the
first
day
espionage
being
a
piece
of
evidence
so
incomplete
he
had
hoped
to
command
himself
until
more
solid
proof
of
his
wife
guilt
were
forthcoming
but
jealousy
was
too
strong
for
such
prudence
and
the
sight
of
monica
as
she
uttered
her
falsehood
made
a
mere
madman
of
him
predisposed
to
believe
a
story
of
this
kind
he
could
not
reason
as
he
might
have
done
if
fear
of
barfoot
had
never
entered
his
thoughts
the
whole
course
of
dishonour
seemed
so
clear
he
traced
it
from
monica
earliest
meetings
with
barfoot
at
chelsea
wavering
between
the
impulse
to
cast
off
his
wife
with
every
circumstance
of
public
shame
and
the
piteous
desire
to
arrest
her
on
her
path
of
destruction
he
rushed
into
a
middle
course
compatible
with
neither
of
these
intentions
if
at
this
stage
he
chose
to
tell
monica
what
had
come
to
his
knowledge
it
should
have
been
done
with
the
sternest
calm
with
dignity
capable
of
shaming
her
guilt
as
it
was
he
had
spoilt
his
chances
in
every
direction
perhaps
monica
understood
this
he
had
begun
to
esteem
her
a
mistress
in
craft
and
intrigue
say
you
were
never
at
that
man
rooms
before
he
asked
in
a
lower
voice
i
have
said
you
must
take
the
trouble
to
recollect
i
shall
answer
no
question
again
the
impulse
assailed
him
to
wring
confession
from
her
by
terror
he
took
a
step
forward
the
demon
in
his
face
monica
in
that
moment
leapt
past
him
and
reached
the
door
of
the
room
before
he
could
stop
her
where
you
are
she
cried
your
hands
touch
me
again
i
shall
call
for
help
until
someone
comes
up
i
wo
endure
your
touch
you
pretend
you
are
innocent
of
any
crime
against
me
am
not
what
you
called
me
explain
everything
as
you
like
i
will
explain
nothing
i
want
only
to
be
free
from
you
she
opened
the
door
rapidly
crossed
the
landing
and
went
upstairs
feeling
it
was
useless
to
follow
widdowson
allowed
the
door
to
remain
wide
and
waited
five
minutes
passed
and
monica
came
down
again
dressed
for
leaving
the
house
are
you
going
he
asked
stepping
out
of
the
room
to
intercept
her
is
nothing
to
you
i
am
going
away
they
subdued
their
voices
which
might
else
have
been
audible
to
the
servants
below
that
you
shall
not
he
stepped
forward
to
block
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
again
monica
was
too
quick
for
him
she
fled
down
and
across
the
hall
and
to
the
only
there
as
she
was
arrested
by
the
difficulty
of
drawing
back
the
two
latches
did
widdowson
overtake
her
what
scandal
you
like
you
do
leave
this
house
his
tones
were
violent
rather
than
resolute
what
could
he
do
if
monica
persisted
what
means
had
he
of
confining
her
to
the
house
short
of
carrying
her
by
main
force
to
an
upper
room
and
there
locking
her
in
he
knew
that
his
courage
would
not
sustain
him
through
such
a
task
as
this
scandal
i
care
nothing
was
her
reply
way
or
another
i
will
leave
the
house
are
you
going
my
sister
his
hand
on
the
door
widdowson
stood
as
if
determined
in
opposition
but
her
will
was
stronger
than
his
only
by
homicide
can
a
man
maintain
his
dignity
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
widdowson
could
not
kill
his
wife
and
every
moment
that
he
stood
there
made
him
more
ridiculous
more
contemptible
he
turned
back
into
the
hall
and
reached
his
hat
whilst
he
was
doing
so
monica
opened
the
door
heavy
rain
was
falling
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
it
in
a
moment
widdowson
hastened
after
her
careless
he
too
of
the
descending
floods
her
way
was
towards
the
railway
station
but
the
driver
of
a
cab
chancing
to
attract
her
notice
she
accepted
the
offer
and
bade
him
drive
to
lavender
hill
on
the
first
opportunity
widdowson
took
like
refuge
from
the
rain
and
was
driven
in
the
same
direction
he
alighted
not
far
from
conisbee
house
that
monica
had
come
hither
he
felt
no
doubt
but
he
would
presently
make
sure
of
it
as
it
still
rained
he
sought
shelter
in
a
where
he
quenched
a
painful
thirst
and
then
satisfied
his
hunger
with
such
primitive
foods
as
a
licensed
victualler
is
disposed
to
vend
it
was
nearing
eleven
and
he
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
since
luncheon
after
that
he
walked
to
conisbee
and
knocked
at
the
door
the
landlady
came
you
please
to
tell
me
he
asked
widdowson
is
here
the
sly
curiosity
of
the
woman
face
informed
him
at
once
that
she
saw
something
unusual
in
these
circumstances
sir
widdowson
is
with
her
sister
you
without
another
word
he
departed
but
went
only
a
short
distance
and
until
midnight
kept
conisbee
door
in
view
the
rain
fell
the
air
was
raw
shelterless
and
often
shivering
with
fever
widdowson
walked
the
pavement
with
a
constable
regularity
he
could
not
but
remember
the
many
nights
when
he
thus
kept
watch
in
walworth
road
and
in
rutland
street
with
jealousy
then
too
burning
in
his
heart
but
also
with
amorous
ardours
never
again
to
be
revived
a
little
more
than
twelve
months
ago
and
he
had
waited
longed
for
marriage
through
half
a
lifetime
chapter
xxv
the
fate
of
the
ideal
rhoda
week
at
the
seashore
was
spoilt
by
uncertain
weather
only
two
days
of
abiding
sunshine
for
the
rest
mere
fitful
gleams
across
a
sky
heaped
with
stormclouds
over
wastdale
hung
a
black
canopy
from
scawfell
came
mutterings
of
thunder
and
on
the
last
night
of
the
week
when
monica
fled
from
her
home
in
pelting
rain
tempest
broke
upon
the
mountains
and
the
sea
wakeful
until
early
morning
and
at
times
watching
the
sky
from
her
window
rhoda
saw
the
rocky
heights
that
frown
upon
wastwater
illuminated
by
of
such
intensity
and
duration
that
miles
of
distance
were
annihilated
and
it
seemed
but
a
step
to
those
stern
crags
and
precipices
sunday
began
with
rain
but
also
with
promise
of
better
things
far
over
the
sea
was
a
broad
expanse
of
blue
and
before
long
the
foam
of
the
fallen
tide
glistened
in
strong
hopeful
rays
rhoda
wandered
about
the
shore
towards
st
bees
head
a
broad
stream
flowing
into
the
sea
stopped
her
progress
before
she
had
gone
very
far
the
only
way
of
crossing
it
was
to
go
up
on
to
the
line
of
railway
which
here
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
sands
but
she
had
little
inclination
to
walk
farther
no
house
no
person
within
sight
she
sat
down
to
gaze
at
the
gulls
fishing
by
the
little
their
screams
the
only
sound
that
blended
with
that
of
the
subdued
breakers
on
the
horizon
lay
a
long
low
shape
that
might
have
been
mistaken
for
cloud
though
it
resembled
land
it
was
the
isle
of
man
in
an
hour
or
two
the
outline
had
grown
much
clearer
the
heights
and
hollows
were
no
longer
doubtful
in
the
north
became
visible
another
remote
and
hilly
tract
it
was
the
coast
of
scotland
beyond
solway
firth
these
distant
objects
acted
as
incentives
to
rhoda
imagination
she
heard
everard
barfoot
voice
as
he
talked
of
travel
of
the
orient
express
that
joy
of
freedom
he
had
offered
her
perhaps
he
was
now
very
near
her
anxious
to
repeat
his
offer
if
he
carried
out
the
project
suggested
at
their
last
interview
she
would
see
him
or
morning
then
she
must
make
her
choice
to
have
a
day
walk
with
him
among
the
mountains
would
be
practically
deciding
but
for
what
if
she
rejected
his
proposal
of
a
free
union
was
he
prepared
to
marry
her
in
legal
form
yes
she
had
enough
power
over
him
for
that
but
how
would
it
affect
his
thought
of
her
constraining
him
to
legal
marriage
would
she
not
lower
herself
in
his
estimation
and
make
the
endurance
of
his
love
less
probable
barfoot
was
not
a
man
to
accept
with
genuine
satisfaction
even
the
appearance
of
bondage
and
more
likely
than
not
his
love
of
her
depended
upon
the
belief
that
in
her
he
had
found
a
woman
capable
of
regarding
life
from
his
own
point
of
view
a
woman
who
when
she
once
loved
would
be
scornful
of
the
formalities
clung
to
by
feeble
minds
he
would
yield
to
her
if
she
demanded
forms
but
afterwards
when
passion
had
subsided
a
week
had
been
none
too
long
to
ponder
these
considerations
by
themselves
but
they
were
complicated
with
doubts
of
a
more
disturbing
nature
her
mind
could
not
free
itself
from
the
thought
of
monica
that
widdowson
was
not
always
truthful
with
her
husband
she
had
absolute
proof
whether
that
supported
her
fear
of
an
intimacy
between
monica
and
everard
she
was
unable
to
determine
the
grounds
of
suspicion
seemed
to
her
very
grave
so
grave
that
during
her
first
day
or
two
in
cumberland
she
had
all
but
renounced
the
hopes
long
secretly
fostered
she
knew
herself
well
enough
to
understand
how
jealousy
might
wreck
her
life
even
if
it
were
only
retrospective
if
she
married
barfoot
forms
or
none
that
question
in
no
way
touched
this
other
she
would
demand
of
him
a
flawless
faith
her
pride
revolted
against
the
thought
of
possessing
only
a
share
in
his
devotion
the
moment
that
any
faithlessness
came
to
her
knowledge
she
would
leave
him
perforce
inevitably
and
what
miseries
were
then
before
her
was
flawless
faith
possible
to
everard
barfoot
his
cousin
would
ridicule
the
hope
of
any
such
thing
or
so
rhoda
believed
a
conventional
woman
would
of
course
see
the
completest
evidence
of
his
untrustworthiness
in
his
dislike
of
legal
marriage
but
rhoda
knew
the
idleness
of
this
argument
if
love
did
not
hold
him
assuredly
the
forms
of
marriage
could
be
no
restraint
upon
everard
married
ten
times
over
he
would
still
deem
himself
absolutely
free
from
any
obligation
save
that
of
love
yet
how
did
he
think
of
that
obligation
he
might
hold
it
perfectly
compatible
with
the
indulgence
of
casual
impulse
and
this
which
she
suspected
to
be
the
view
of
every
man
rhoda
had
no
power
of
tolerating
it
must
be
all
or
nothing
whole
faith
or
none
whatever
in
the
afternoon
she
suffered
from
impatient
expectancy
if
barfoot
came
she
imagined
him
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
approaching
seascale
as
the
time
of
his
appointment
drew
near
would
he
call
at
her
lodgings
the
address
she
had
not
given
him
but
doubtless
he
had
obtained
it
from
his
cousin
perhaps
he
would
prefer
to
meet
her
unexpectedly
not
a
difficult
thing
in
this
little
place
with
its
handful
of
residents
and
visitors
certain
it
was
she
desired
his
arrival
her
heart
leapt
with
joy
in
the
thought
that
this
very
evening
might
bring
him
she
wished
to
study
him
under
new
conditions
and
possibly
to
talk
with
him
even
more
frankly
than
ever
yet
for
there
would
be
opportunity
enough
about
six
a
train
coming
from
the
south
stopped
at
the
station
which
was
visible
from
rhoda
window
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
moment
she
could
not
go
to
the
station
and
did
not
venture
even
to
wait
anywhere
in
sight
of
the
exit
whether
any
passenger
had
alighted
must
remain
uncertain
if
everard
had
arrived
by
this
train
doubtless
he
would
go
to
the
hotel
which
stood
only
a
few
yards
from
the
line
he
would
take
a
meal
and
presently
come
forth
having
allowed
half
an
hour
to
elapse
she
dressed
and
walked
shoreward
seascale
has
no
street
no
shops
only
two
or
three
short
rows
of
houses
irregularly
placed
on
the
rising
ground
above
the
beach
to
cross
the
intervening
railway
rhoda
could
either
pass
through
the
little
station
in
which
case
she
would
also
pass
the
hotel
and
be
observable
from
its
chief
windows
or
descend
by
a
longer
road
which
led
under
a
bridge
and
in
this
way
avoid
the
hotel
altogether
she
took
the
former
route
on
the
sands
were
a
few
scattered
people
and
some
children
subdued
to
sunday
decorum
the
tide
was
rising
she
went
down
to
the
nearest
tract
of
hard
sand
and
stood
there
for
a
long
time
a
soft
western
breeze
playing
upon
her
face
if
barfoot
were
here
he
would
now
be
coming
out
to
look
for
her
from
a
distance
he
might
not
recognize
her
figure
clad
as
she
was
in
a
costume
such
as
he
had
never
seen
her
wearing
she
might
venture
now
to
walk
up
towards
the
dry
white
sandheaps
where
the
little
convolvulus
grew
in
abundance
and
other
flowers
of
which
she
neither
knew
nor
cared
to
learn
the
names
scarcely
had
she
turned
when
she
saw
everard
approaching
still
far
off
but
unmistakable
he
signalled
by
taking
off
his
hat
and
quickly
was
beside
her
you
know
me
before
i
happened
to
look
round
she
asked
laughingly
course
i
did
up
there
by
the
station
i
caught
sight
of
you
who
else
bears
herself
as
you
do
with
splendid
disdain
of
common
mortals
do
make
me
think
that
my
movements
are
ridiculous
are
superb
the
sea
has
already
touched
your
cheeks
but
i
am
afraid
you
have
had
abominable
weather
rather
bad
but
there
hope
where
do
you
come
from
train
only
from
carnforth
i
left
london
yesterday
morning
and
stopped
at
morecambe
some
people
i
know
are
there
as
trains
were
awkward
i
drove
from
morecambe
to
carnforth
did
you
expect
me
thought
you
might
come
as
you
spoke
of
it
i
have
got
through
the
week
i
could
tell
you
i
should
have
been
here
days
ago
but
i
was
afraid
let
us
go
nearer
to
the
sea
i
was
afraid
of
making
you
angry
better
to
keep
one
word
course
it
is
and
i
am
all
the
more
delighted
to
be
with
you
for
the
miserable
week
of
waiting
have
you
bathed
or
twice
had
a
swim
this
morning
before
breakfast
in
pouring
rain
now
ca
swim
i
ca
but
why
were
you
sure
about
it
because
it
so
rare
for
any
girl
to
learn
swimming
a
man
who
ca
swim
is
only
half
the
man
he
might
be
and
to
a
woman
i
should
think
it
must
be
of
even
more
benefit
as
in
everything
else
women
are
trammelled
by
their
clothes
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
them
and
to
move
about
with
free
and
brave
exertion
of
all
the
body
must
tend
to
every
kind
of
health
physical
mental
and
mortal
i
quite
believe
that
said
rhoda
gazing
at
the
sea
spoke
rather
exultantly
did
i
i
like
to
feel
myself
superior
to
you
in
some
things
you
have
so
often
pointed
out
to
me
what
a
paltry
ineffectual
creature
i
am
do
remember
ever
using
those
words
or
implying
them
does
the
day
stand
with
you
asked
everard
in
the
tone
of
perfect
comradeship
you
still
to
dine
dining
is
a
very
simple
matter
it
happens
at
one
about
nine
i
shall
have
supper
us
walk
a
little
then
and
may
i
smoke
not
everard
lit
a
cigar
and
as
the
tide
drove
them
back
they
moved
eventually
to
the
higher
ground
whence
there
was
a
fine
view
of
the
mountains
rich
in
evening
colours
you
leave
here
rhoda
answered
shall
go
by
railway
to
coniston
and
walk
from
there
towards
helvellyn
as
you
suggested
have
something
else
to
propose
a
man
i
talked
to
in
the
train
told
me
of
a
fine
walk
in
this
neighbourhood
from
ravenglass
just
below
here
there
a
little
line
runs
up
eskdale
to
a
terminus
at
the
foot
of
scawfell
a
place
called
boot
from
boot
one
can
walk
either
over
the
top
of
scawfell
or
by
a
lower
track
to
wastdale
head
it
very
grand
wild
country
especially
the
last
part
the
going
down
to
wastwater
and
not
many
miles
in
all
suppose
we
have
that
walk
from
wastdale
we
could
drive
back
to
seascale
in
the
evening
and
then
the
next
day
just
as
you
like
you
quite
sure
about
the
distances
i
have
the
ordnance
map
in
my
pocket
let
me
show
you
he
spread
the
map
on
the
top
of
a
wall
and
they
stood
side
by
side
inspecting
it
must
take
something
to
eat
i
provide
for
that
and
at
the
wastdale
head
hotel
we
can
have
dinner
about
three
or
four
probably
it
would
be
enjoyable
would
it
it
does
rain
hope
it
wo
as
we
go
back
we
can
look
out
the
trains
at
the
station
no
doubt
there
one
soon
after
breakfast
their
rambling
with
talk
in
a
strain
of
easy
friendliness
brought
them
back
to
seascale
half
an
hour
after
sunset
which
was
of
a
kind
that
seemed
to
promise
well
for
the
morrow
you
come
out
again
after
supper
barfoot
asked
again
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
urged
down
to
the
sea
and
back
have
been
walking
all
day
i
shall
be
glad
to
rest
and
read
well
morning
having
discovered
the
train
which
would
take
them
to
ravenglass
and
connect
with
one
on
the
eskdale
line
they
agreed
to
meet
at
the
station
barfoot
was
to
bring
with
him
such
refreshment
as
would
be
necessary
their
hopes
for
the
weather
had
complete
fulfilment
the
only
fear
was
lest
the
sun
heat
might
be
oppressive
but
this
anxiety
could
be
cheerfully
borne
slung
over
his
shoulders
barfoot
had
a
small
which
gave
him
matter
for
talk
on
the
railway
journey
it
had
been
his
companion
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
had
held
strange
kinds
of
food
the
journey
up
eskdale
from
ravenglass
to
boot
is
by
a
miniature
railway
with
the
oddest
little
engine
and
a
carriage
or
two
of
primitive
simplicity
at
each
station
on
the
upward
winding
track
stations
represented
only
by
a
wooden
shed
like
a
the
guard
jumps
down
and
acts
as
if
passengers
there
be
desirous
of
booking
in
a
few
miles
the
scenery
changes
from
beauty
to
grandeur
and
at
the
terminus
no
further
steaming
would
be
possible
for
the
great
flank
of
scawfell
bars
the
way
everard
and
his
companion
began
their
climb
through
the
pretty
straggling
village
of
boot
a
mountain
torrent
roared
by
the
wayside
and
the
course
they
had
marked
upon
the
map
showed
that
they
must
follow
this
stream
for
some
miles
up
to
the
tarn
where
it
originated
houses
human
beings
and
even
trodden
paths
they
soon
left
behind
coming
out
on
to
a
vast
moorland
with
hill
summits
near
and
far
scawfell
they
could
not
hope
to
ascend
with
the
walk
that
lay
before
them
it
was
enough
to
make
a
way
over
one
of
his
huge
shoulders
your
strength
fails
said
everard
merrily
when
for
an
hour
they
had
been
plodding
through
grey
solitudes
is
no
human
help
i
should
have
to
choose
between
carrying
you
back
to
boot
or
on
to
wastdale
strength
is
not
likely
to
fail
sooner
than
yours
was
the
laughing
reply
have
chicken
sandwiches
and
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
tell
me
when
hunger
overcomes
you
i
should
think
we
had
better
make
our
halt
at
burmoor
tarn
that
indeed
proved
to
be
the
convenient
a
wild
spot
a
hollow
amid
the
rolling
expanse
of
moorland
its
little
lake
of
black
water
glistening
under
the
midday
sun
and
here
stood
a
cottage
the
only
habitation
they
had
seen
since
leaving
boot
somewhat
uncertain
about
the
course
to
be
henceforth
followed
they
made
inquiry
at
this
cottage
and
a
woman
who
appeared
to
be
quite
alone
gave
them
the
needful
direction
thus
at
ease
in
mind
they
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
foot
of
the
tarn
and
just
beyond
it
found
a
spot
suitable
for
repose
everard
brought
forth
his
sandwiches
and
his
flask
of
wine
moreover
a
which
was
for
rhoda
use
they
ate
and
drank
festively
this
is
just
what
i
have
enjoyed
in
imagination
for
a
year
or
more
said
barfoot
when
the
luncheon
was
over
and
he
lay
propped
upon
his
elbow
gazing
at
rhoda
fine
eyes
and
her
cheeks
ideal
realized
for
once
in
one
life
a
perfect
moment
you
like
the
scent
of
burning
peat
from
that
cottage
i
like
everything
about
us
in
heaven
and
earth
and
most
of
all
i
like
your
companionship
rhoda
she
could
not
resent
this
first
use
of
her
christian
name
it
was
so
natural
so
inevitable
yet
she
moved
her
head
as
if
with
a
slight
annoyance
mine
as
agreeable
to
you
he
added
stroking
the
back
of
her
hand
with
a
spray
of
heather
do
you
just
tolerate
me
out
of
have
liked
your
companionship
all
the
way
from
seascale
disturb
my
enjoyment
of
it
for
the
rest
of
the
way
would
be
a
misfortune
indeed
the
whole
day
shall
be
perfect
not
a
note
of
discord
but
i
must
have
liberty
to
say
what
comes
into
my
mind
and
when
you
do
choose
to
answer
i
shall
respect
your
silence
you
like
to
smoke
a
cigar
before
we
start
again
but
i
like
still
better
not
to
the
scent
of
peat
is
pleasanter
to
you
than
that
of
tobacco
me
by
lighting
the
cigar
you
command
he
did
her
bidding
whole
day
shall
be
perfect
a
delightful
dinner
at
the
inn
a
drive
to
seascale
an
hour
or
two
of
rest
and
then
one
more
quiet
talk
by
the
sea
at
nightfall
but
the
last
i
shall
be
too
tired
i
must
have
that
hour
of
talk
by
the
sea
you
are
free
to
answer
me
or
not
but
your
presence
you
must
grant
me
we
are
in
an
ideal
world
remember
we
care
nothing
for
all
the
sons
and
daughters
of
men
you
and
i
will
spend
this
one
day
together
between
cloudless
heaven
and
silent
earth
a
memory
for
lifetime
at
nightfall
you
will
come
out
again
and
meet
me
down
by
the
sea
where
you
stood
when
i
first
saw
you
yesterday
rhoda
made
no
reply
she
looked
away
from
him
at
the
black
deep
water
an
opportunity
he
went
on
raising
his
hand
to
point
at
the
cottage
saying
the
silliest
of
conceivable
things
that
be
i
wonder
that
to
dwell
there
together
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
would
be
supreme
felicity
you
know
the
kind
of
man
that
would
say
that
personally
thank
goodness
week
a
month
even
with
weather
such
as
this
nay
with
a
storm
for
variety
clouds
from
the
top
of
scawfell
falling
thick
about
us
a
fierce
wind
shrieking
across
the
tarn
sheets
and
torrents
and
floods
of
rain
beating
upon
our
roof
and
you
and
i
by
the
with
a
good
supply
of
books
old
and
new
i
can
picture
it
for
three
months
for
half
a
year
on
your
guard
remember
that
kind
of
man
am
in
no
danger
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
six
months
and
all
one
life
when
the
was
over
we
would
leave
england
the
orient
express
they
laughed
together
rhoda
colouring
for
the
words
that
had
escaped
her
meant
too
much
for
mere
jest
the
orient
express
we
would
have
a
house
by
the
bosphorus
for
the
next
and
contrast
our
emotions
with
those
we
had
known
by
burmoor
tarn
think
what
a
rich
year
of
life
that
would
make
how
much
we
should
have
learnt
from
nature
and
from
each
other
how
dreadfully
tired
of
each
other
we
should
be
barfoot
looked
keenly
at
her
he
could
not
with
certainty
read
her
countenance
mean
that
he
asked
know
it
is
true
the
day
is
to
be
perfect
i
wo
admit
that
we
could
ever
tire
of
each
other
with
reasonable
variety
of
circumstance
you
to
me
are
infinitely
interesting
and
i
believe
that
i
might
become
so
to
you
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
vary
from
this
tone
of
fanciful
speculation
suited
to
the
idle
hour
rhoda
said
very
little
her
remarks
were
generally
a
purposed
interruption
of
everard
theme
when
the
cigar
was
smoked
out
they
rose
and
set
forward
again
this
latter
half
of
their
walk
proved
the
most
interesting
for
they
were
expectant
of
the
view
down
upon
wastdale
a
bold
summit
came
in
sight
dark
desolate
which
they
judged
to
be
great
gabel
and
when
they
had
pressed
on
eagerly
for
another
mile
the
valley
opened
beneath
them
with
such
striking
suddenness
that
they
stopped
on
the
instant
and
glanced
at
each
other
in
silence
from
a
noble
height
they
looked
down
upon
wastwater
sternest
and
blackest
of
the
lakes
on
the
fields
and
copses
of
the
valley
head
with
its
winding
stream
and
the
rugged
gorges
which
lie
beyond
in
mountain
shadow
the
descent
was
by
a
path
which
in
winter
becomes
the
bed
of
a
torrent
steep
and
stony
zigzagging
through
a
thick
wood
here
and
when
they
had
reached
the
level
road
leading
into
the
village
their
talk
was
in
the
same
natural
strain
as
before
they
rested
so
at
the
inn
where
they
dined
and
during
their
drive
homewards
by
the
dark
lake
with
its
woods
and
precipices
out
into
the
country
of
green
hills
and
thence
through
gosforth
on
the
long
road
descending
seaward
since
their
early
departure
scarcely
a
cloud
had
passed
over
the
sun
a
perfect
day
they
alighted
before
reaching
seascale
barfoot
discharged
his
debt
to
the
driver
who
went
on
to
bait
at
the
hotel
and
walked
with
rhoda
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
mile
this
was
his
own
idea
rhoda
made
no
remark
but
approved
his
discretion
is
six
said
everard
after
a
short
silence
remember
your
arrangement
at
eight
down
on
the
shore
should
be
much
more
comfortable
in
the
armchair
with
a
book
you
have
had
enough
of
books
it
time
to
live
time
to
rest
you
so
very
tired
poor
girl
the
day
has
been
rather
too
much
for
you
rhoda
laughed
could
walk
back
again
to
wastwater
if
it
were
necessary
course
i
knew
that
you
are
magnificent
at
eight
then
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
when
in
sight
of
rhoda
lodgings
they
parted
without
before
eight
everard
was
straying
about
the
beach
watching
the
sun
go
down
in
splendour
he
smiled
to
himself
frequently
the
hour
had
come
for
his
last
trial
of
rhoda
and
he
felt
some
confidence
as
to
the
result
if
her
mettle
endured
his
test
if
she
declared
herself
willing
not
only
to
abandon
her
avowed
ideal
of
life
but
to
defy
the
opinion
by
becoming
his
wife
without
forms
of
mutual
bondage
she
was
the
woman
he
had
imagined
and
by
her
side
he
would
go
cheerfully
on
his
way
as
a
married
man
legally
married
the
proposal
of
free
union
was
to
be
a
test
only
loving
her
as
he
had
never
thought
to
love
there
still
remained
with
him
so
much
of
the
temper
in
which
he
first
wooed
her
that
he
could
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
unconditional
surrender
delighting
in
her
independence
of
mind
he
still
desired
to
see
her
in
complete
subjugation
to
him
to
inspire
her
with
unreflecting
passion
tame
consent
to
matrimony
was
an
everyday
experience
agnes
brissenden
he
felt
sure
would
marry
him
whenever
he
chose
to
ask
her
and
would
make
one
of
the
best
wives
conceivable
but
of
rhoda
nunn
he
expected
and
demanded
more
than
this
she
must
rise
far
above
the
level
of
ordinary
intelligent
women
she
must
manifest
an
absolute
confidence
in
him
that
was
the
true
significance
of
his
present
motives
the
censures
and
suspicions
which
she
had
not
scrupled
to
confess
in
plain
words
must
linger
in
no
corner
of
her
mind
his
heart
throbbed
with
impatience
for
her
coming
come
she
would
it
was
not
in
rhoda
nature
to
play
tricks
if
she
had
not
meant
to
meet
him
she
would
have
said
so
resolutely
as
last
night
at
a
few
minutes
past
the
hour
he
looked
landward
and
saw
her
figure
against
the
golden
sky
she
came
down
from
the
sandbank
very
slowly
with
careless
loitering
steps
he
moved
but
a
little
way
to
meet
her
and
then
stood
still
he
had
done
his
part
it
was
now
hers
to
forego
female
privileges
to
obey
the
constraint
of
love
the
western
afterglow
touched
her
features
heightening
the
beauty
everard
had
learnt
to
see
in
them
still
she
loitered
stooping
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
seaweed
but
still
he
kept
his
place
motionless
and
she
came
nearer
you
see
the
light
of
sunset
on
the
mountains
he
replied
has
been
no
such
evening
since
i
came
you
wanted
to
sit
at
home
with
a
book
that
was
no
close
for
a
perfect
day
found
a
letter
from
your
cousin
she
was
with
her
friends
the
goodalls
yesterday
goodalls
i
used
to
know
them
the
word
was
uttered
with
significance
everard
understood
the
allusion
but
did
not
care
to
show
that
he
did
does
mary
get
on
without
you
no
difficulty
she
any
one
capable
of
taking
your
place
miss
vesper
can
do
all
that
necessary
to
inspiring
the
girls
with
zeal
for
an
independent
life
even
that
they
went
along
by
the
waves
in
the
twilight
until
the
houses
of
seascale
were
hidden
then
everard
stopped
we
go
to
coniston
he
said
smiling
as
he
stood
before
her
are
going
you
think
i
can
leave
you
rhoda
eyes
fell
she
held
the
long
strip
of
seaweed
with
both
hands
and
tightened
it
you
me
to
leave
you
he
added
mean
that
we
are
to
go
through
the
lakes
together
as
we
have
been
i
do
mean
that
rhoda
took
a
few
steps
onward
so
that
he
remained
standing
behind
another
moment
and
his
arms
had
folded
about
her
his
lips
were
on
hers
she
did
not
resist
his
embrace
grew
stronger
and
he
pressed
kiss
after
kiss
upon
her
mouth
with
exquisite
delight
he
saw
the
deep
crimson
flush
that
transfigured
her
countenance
saw
her
look
for
one
instant
into
his
eyes
and
was
conscious
of
the
triumphant
gleam
she
met
there
you
remember
my
saying
in
the
letter
how
i
hungered
to
taste
your
lips
i
do
know
how
i
have
refrained
so
long
is
your
love
worth
asked
rhoda
speaking
with
a
great
effort
she
had
dropped
the
seaweed
and
one
of
her
hands
rested
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
slight
repelling
pressure
your
whole
life
he
answered
with
a
low
glad
laugh
is
what
i
doubt
convince
me
of
that
you
with
more
kisses
but
what
is
love
worth
more
than
you
yet
understand
perhaps
more
than
you
understand
will
believe
that
rhoda
i
know
at
all
events
that
it
is
something
of
inestimable
price
the
knowledge
has
grown
in
me
for
a
year
and
more
me
stand
away
from
you
again
there
is
something
more
to
be
said
before
no
let
me
be
quite
apart
from
you
he
released
her
after
one
more
kiss
you
answer
me
a
question
with
perfect
truthfulness
her
voice
was
not
quite
steady
but
she
succeeded
in
looking
at
him
with
unflinching
eyes
i
will
answer
you
question
is
spoken
like
a
man
tell
me
then
is
there
at
this
moment
any
woman
living
who
has
a
claim
upon
you
a
moral
claim
such
woman
exists
do
we
speak
the
same
language
he
answered
with
great
earnestness
is
no
woman
to
whom
i
am
bound
by
any
kind
of
obligation
a
long
wave
rolled
up
broke
and
retreated
whilst
rhoda
stood
in
silent
uncertainty
must
put
the
question
in
another
way
during
the
past
month
the
past
three
months
have
you
made
profession
of
love
have
you
even
pretended
love
to
any
woman
no
woman
whatever
he
answered
firmly
satisfies
me
i
knew
what
is
in
your
mind
exclaimed
everard
laughing
sort
of
life
have
you
imagined
for
me
is
this
the
result
of
talk
immediately
she
planted
the
suspicion
believe
me
you
have
been
altogether
mistaken
i
never
was
the
kind
of
man
mary
thought
me
some
day
you
shall
understand
more
about
it
in
the
meantime
my
word
must
be
enough
i
have
no
thought
of
love
for
any
woman
but
you
did
i
frighten
you
with
those
joking
confessions
in
my
letters
i
wrote
them
purposely
as
you
must
have
seen
the
mean
paltry
jealousies
of
women
such
as
one
meets
every
day
are
so
hateful
to
me
they
argue
such
a
lack
of
brains
if
i
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
love
a
woman
who
looked
sour
when
i
praised
a
beautiful
face
i
would
snap
the
bond
between
us
like
a
bit
of
thread
but
you
are
not
one
of
those
poor
creatures
he
looked
at
her
with
some
gravity
you
think
me
a
poor
creature
if
i
resented
any
kind
of
unfaithfulness
whether
love
in
any
noble
sense
had
part
in
it
or
not
that
is
the
reasonable
understanding
between
man
and
wife
if
i
exact
fidelity
from
you
and
certainly
i
should
i
must
consider
myself
under
the
same
obligation
say
man
and
wife
do
you
say
it
with
the
ordinary
meaning
as
it
applies
to
us
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
if
we
can
not
trust
each
other
without
legal
bonds
any
union
between
us
would
be
unjustified
suppressing
the
agitation
which
he
felt
he
awaited
her
answer
they
could
still
read
each
other
faces
perfectly
in
a
pale
yellow
light
from
across
the
sea
rhoda
manifested
an
intense
conflict
all
you
doubt
of
your
love
for
me
said
barfoot
quietly
that
was
not
her
doubt
she
loved
with
passion
allowing
herself
to
indulge
the
luxurious
emotion
as
never
yet
she
longed
once
more
to
feel
his
arms
about
her
but
even
thus
she
could
consider
the
vast
issues
of
the
step
to
which
she
was
urged
the
temptation
to
yield
was
very
strong
for
it
seemed
to
her
an
easier
and
a
nobler
thing
to
proclaim
her
emancipation
from
social
statutes
than
to
announce
before
her
friends
the
simple
news
that
she
was
about
to
marry
that
announcement
would
excite
something
more
than
surprise
mary
barfoot
could
not
but
smile
with
gentle
irony
other
women
would
laugh
among
themselves
the
girls
would
feel
a
shock
as
at
the
fall
of
one
who
had
made
heroic
pretences
a
sure
way
of
averting
this
ridicule
was
by
furnishing
occasion
for
much
graver
astonishment
if
it
became
known
that
she
had
taken
a
step
such
as
few
women
would
have
dared
to
take
deliberately
setting
an
example
of
new
liberty
her
position
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
knew
her
remained
one
of
proud
independence
rhoda
character
was
specially
exposed
to
the
temptation
of
such
a
motive
for
months
this
argument
had
been
in
her
mind
again
and
again
she
decided
that
the
sensational
step
was
preferable
to
a
commonplace
renunciation
of
all
she
had
so
vehemently
preached
and
now
that
the
moment
of
actual
choice
had
come
she
felt
able
to
dare
everything
as
far
as
the
danger
concerned
herself
but
she
perceived
more
strongly
than
hitherto
that
not
only
her
own
future
was
involved
how
would
such
practical
heresy
affect
everard
position
she
uttered
this
thought
you
willing
for
the
sake
of
this
idea
to
abandon
all
society
but
that
of
the
very
few
people
who
would
approve
or
tolerate
what
you
have
done
look
upon
the
thing
in
this
way
we
are
not
called
upon
to
declare
our
principles
wherever
we
go
if
we
regard
each
other
as
married
why
we
married
i
am
no
quixote
hoping
to
convert
the
world
it
is
between
you
and
me
our
own
sense
of
what
is
reasonable
and
dignified
you
would
not
make
it
a
mere
deception
would
of
course
be
told
and
any
one
else
you
like
she
believed
him
entirely
serious
another
woman
might
have
suspected
that
he
was
merely
trying
her
courage
either
to
assure
himself
of
her
love
or
to
gratify
his
vanity
but
rhoda
idealism
enabled
her
to
take
him
literally
she
herself
had
for
years
maintained
an
exaggerated
standard
of
duty
and
merit
desirous
of
seeing
everard
in
a
nobler
light
than
hitherto
she
endeavoured
to
regard
his
scruple
against
formal
wedlock
as
worthy
of
all
respect
ca
answer
you
at
once
she
said
half
turning
away
must
here
and
at
once
the
one
word
of
assent
would
have
satisfied
him
this
he
obstinately
required
he
believed
that
it
would
confirm
his
love
beyond
any
other
satisfaction
she
could
render
him
he
must
be
able
to
regard
her
as
magnanimous
a
woman
who
had
proved
herself
worth
living
or
dying
for
and
he
must
have
the
joy
of
subduing
her
to
his
will
said
rhoda
firmly
ca
answer
you
tonight
i
ca
decide
so
suddenly
this
was
disingenuous
and
she
felt
humiliated
by
her
subterfuge
anything
but
a
sudden
decision
was
asked
of
her
before
leaving
chelsea
she
had
foreseen
this
moment
and
had
made
preparations
for
the
possibility
of
never
returning
to
miss
barfoot
house
knowing
the
nature
of
the
proposal
that
would
be
offered
to
her
but
the
practical
resolve
needed
a
greater
effort
than
she
had
imagined
above
all
she
feared
an
ignominious
failure
of
purpose
after
her
word
was
given
would
belittle
her
in
everard
eyes
and
so
shame
her
in
her
own
that
all
hope
of
happiness
in
marriage
must
be
at
an
end
are
still
doubtful
of
me
rhoda
he
took
her
hand
and
again
drew
her
close
but
she
refused
her
lips
are
you
doubtful
of
your
own
love
if
i
understand
what
love
means
i
love
you
give
me
the
kiss
i
am
waiting
for
you
have
not
kissed
me
yet
ca
until
i
am
sure
of
myself
of
my
readiness
her
broken
words
betrayed
the
passion
with
which
she
was
struggling
everard
felt
her
tremble
against
his
side
me
your
hand
he
whispered
left
hand
before
she
could
guess
his
purpose
he
had
slipped
a
ring
upon
her
finger
a
marriage
ring
rhoda
started
away
from
him
and
at
once
drew
off
the
perilous
symbol
that
proves
to
me
i
ca
what
should
we
gain
you
see
you
dare
not
be
quite
consistent
it
only
deceiving
the
people
who
do
know
us
i
have
explained
to
you
the
consistency
is
in
ourselves
our
own
minds
it
back
custom
is
too
strong
for
us
we
should
only
play
at
defying
it
take
it
back
or
i
shall
drop
it
on
the
sand
profoundly
mortified
everard
restored
the
gold
circlet
to
its
and
stood
gazing
at
the
dim
horizon
some
moments
passed
then
he
heard
his
name
murmured
he
did
not
look
round
dearest
was
that
rhoda
voice
so
low
tender
caressing
it
thrilled
him
and
with
a
silent
laugh
of
scorn
at
his
own
folly
he
turned
to
her
every
thought
burnt
up
in
passion
you
kiss
me
for
an
answer
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
gazed
at
him
barfoot
understood
he
smiled
constrainedly
and
said
in
a
low
voice
wish
for
that
old
idle
form
the
religious
form
which
has
no
meaning
for
either
of
us
but
have
been
living
here
seven
or
eight
days
stay
till
the
fifteenth
then
we
can
get
a
licence
from
the
registrar
of
the
district
does
that
please
you
her
eyes
made
reply
you
love
me
any
the
less
everard
me
she
did
and
consciousness
was
lost
for
them
as
their
mouths
clung
together
and
their
hearts
throbbed
like
one
it
better
rhoda
asked
as
they
walked
back
in
the
darkness
it
make
our
life
so
much
simpler
and
happier
know
it
will
she
laughed
joyously
trying
to
meet
his
look
you
are
right
shall
let
no
one
hear
of
it
until
then
let
us
go
abroad
dare
not
face
mary
dare
if
you
wish
it
of
course
she
will
laugh
at
me
they
will
all
laugh
at
me
you
may
laugh
as
well
you
have
spoilt
my
life
you
know
such
a
grand
life
it
might
have
been
why
did
you
come
and
interfere
with
me
and
you
have
been
so
terribly
obstinate
course
that
my
nature
but
after
all
i
have
been
weak
in
one
point
that
did
matter
to
you
at
all
it
was
the
only
way
of
making
sure
that
you
loved
me
barfoot
laughed
slightingly
what
if
i
needed
the
other
proof
that
you
loved
chapter
xxvi
the
unideal
tested
and
neither
was
content
barfoot
over
his
cigar
and
glass
of
whisky
at
the
hotel
fell
into
a
mood
of
chagrin
the
woman
he
loved
would
be
his
and
there
was
matter
enough
for
ardent
imagination
in
the
indulgence
of
that
thought
but
his
temper
disturbed
him
after
all
he
had
not
triumphed
as
usual
the
woman
had
her
way
she
played
upon
his
senses
and
made
him
her
obedient
slave
to
prolong
the
conflict
would
have
availed
nothing
rhoda
doubtless
was
in
part
actuated
by
the
desire
to
conquer
and
she
knew
her
power
over
him
so
it
was
a
mere
repetition
of
the
old
story
a
marriage
like
any
other
and
how
would
it
result
she
had
great
qualities
but
was
there
not
much
in
her
that
he
must
subdue
reform
if
they
were
really
to
spend
their
lives
together
her
energy
of
domination
perhaps
excelled
his
such
a
woman
might
be
unable
to
concede
him
the
liberty
in
marriage
which
theoretically
she
granted
to
be
just
perhaps
she
would
torment
him
with
restless
jealousies
suspecting
on
every
trivial
occasion
an
infringement
of
her
right
from
that
point
of
view
it
would
have
been
far
wiser
to
persist
in
rejecting
legal
marriage
that
her
dependence
upon
him
might
be
more
complete
later
if
all
went
well
the
concession
could
have
been
made
if
for
instance
she
became
a
mother
but
then
returned
the
exasperating
thought
that
rhoda
had
overcome
his
will
was
not
that
a
beginning
of
evil
augury
to
be
sure
after
marriage
their
relations
would
be
different
he
would
not
then
be
at
the
mercy
of
his
senses
but
how
miserable
to
anticipate
a
long
perhaps
bitter
struggle
for
predominance
after
all
that
could
hardly
come
about
the
commencement
of
any
such
discord
would
be
the
signal
for
separation
his
wealth
assured
his
freedom
he
was
not
like
the
poor
devils
who
must
perforce
live
with
an
intolerable
woman
because
they
can
not
support
themselves
and
their
families
in
different
places
need
he
entertain
that
worst
of
fears
the
dread
that
his
independence
might
fail
him
subdued
by
his
wife
will
free
as
he
boasted
himself
from
lover
silliness
he
had
magnified
rhoda
image
she
was
not
the
glorious
rebel
he
had
pictured
like
any
other
woman
she
mistrusted
her
love
without
the
sanction
of
society
well
that
was
something
relinquished
lost
marriage
would
after
all
be
a
compromise
he
had
not
found
his
ideal
though
in
these
days
it
assuredly
existed
and
rhoda
sitting
late
in
the
little
parlour
visited
her
soul
with
questionings
no
less
troublesome
everard
was
not
satisfied
with
her
he
had
yielded
perhaps
more
than
half
contemptuously
to
what
he
thought
a
feminine
weakness
in
going
with
her
to
the
registrar
office
he
would
feel
himself
to
be
acting
an
ignoble
part
was
it
not
a
bad
beginning
to
rule
him
against
his
conscience
she
had
triumphed
splendidly
in
the
world
eye
this
marriage
of
hers
was
far
better
than
any
she
could
reasonably
have
hoped
and
her
heart
approved
it
with
rapture
at
a
stage
in
life
when
she
had
sternly
reconciled
herself
never
to
know
a
man
love
this
love
had
sought
her
with
passionate
persistency
of
which
even
a
beautiful
young
girl
might
feel
proud
she
had
no
beauty
she
was
loved
for
her
mind
her
very
self
but
must
not
everard
conception
of
her
have
suffered
in
winning
her
had
he
obtained
the
woman
of
his
desire
why
was
she
not
more
politic
would
it
not
have
been
possible
to
gratify
him
and
yet
to
gain
his
consent
to
legal
marriage
by
first
of
all
complying
she
would
have
seemed
to
confirm
all
he
believed
of
her
and
then
his
ardour
at
height
how
simple
to
point
out
to
him
without
entreaty
without
show
of
much
concern
that
by
neglecting
formalities
they
gained
absolutely
nothing
artifice
of
that
kind
was
perhaps
demanded
by
the
mere
circumstances
possibly
he
himself
would
have
welcomed
it
after
the
grateful
sense
of
inspiring
such
complete
devotion
it
is
the
woman
part
to
exercise
tact
she
had
proved
herself
lamentably
deficient
in
that
quality
she
must
study
his
manner
if
she
discerned
any
serious
change
any
grave
indication
of
disappointment
what
was
her
life
to
be
at
first
they
would
travel
together
but
before
long
it
might
be
necessary
to
have
a
settled
home
and
what
then
would
be
her
social
position
her
duties
and
pleasures
housekeeping
mere
domesticities
could
never
occupy
her
for
more
than
the
smallest
possible
part
of
each
day
having
lost
one
purpose
in
life
dignified
absorbing
likely
to
extend
its
sphere
as
time
went
on
what
other
could
she
hope
to
substitute
for
it
love
of
husband
perhaps
of
child
there
must
be
more
than
that
rhoda
did
not
deceive
herself
as
to
the
requirements
of
her
nature
practical
activity
in
some
intellectual
undertaking
a
share
nay
leadership
in
some
movement
contact
with
the
revolutionary
life
of
her
time
the
impulses
of
her
heart
once
satisfied
these
things
would
again
claim
her
but
how
if
everard
resisted
such
tendencies
was
he
in
truth
capable
of
respecting
her
individuality
or
would
his
strong
instinct
of
lordship
urge
him
to
direct
his
wife
as
a
dependent
to
impose
upon
her
his
own
view
of
things
she
doubted
whether
he
had
much
genuine
sympathy
with
woman
emancipation
as
she
understood
it
yet
in
no
particular
had
her
convictions
changed
nor
would
they
change
she
herself
was
no
longer
one
of
the
women
fortune
had
or
seemed
to
have
been
kind
to
her
none
the
less
her
sense
of
a
mission
remained
no
longer
an
example
of
perfect
female
independence
and
unable
therefore
to
use
the
same
language
as
before
she
might
illustrate
woman
claim
of
equality
in
if
her
experience
proved
no
obstacle
next
morning
as
had
been
agreed
they
met
at
some
distance
from
seascale
and
spent
two
or
three
hours
together
there
was
little
danger
in
observation
unless
by
a
casual
peasant
for
the
most
part
their
privacy
could
not
have
been
more
secure
in
a
locked
chamber
lest
curiosity
should
be
excited
by
his
making
inquiries
at
the
hotel
barfoot
proposed
to
walk
over
to
gosforth
the
nearest
town
this
afternoon
and
learn
where
the
registrar
for
the
locality
of
seascale
might
be
found
by
neither
was
allusion
made
to
their
difference
of
last
evening
but
rhoda
distressed
herself
by
imagining
a
diminished
fervour
in
her
companion
he
seemed
unusually
silent
and
meditative
and
was
content
to
hold
her
hand
now
and
then
you
stay
here
all
the
week
she
inquired
you
wish
me
to
will
find
it
wearisome
with
you
here
but
if
i
run
up
to
london
for
a
day
or
two
it
might
be
better
there
are
preparations
we
shall
go
first
of
all
to
my
rooms
would
rather
not
have
stayed
in
london
thought
you
might
wish
to
make
purchases
us
go
to
some
other
town
and
spend
a
few
days
there
before
leaving
england
well
manchester
or
birmingham
speak
rather
impatiently
said
rhoda
looking
at
him
with
an
uneasy
smile
it
be
london
if
you
prefer
no
account
it
all
indifferent
to
me
so
long
as
we
get
safely
away
together
every
man
is
impatient
of
these
preliminaries
yes
in
that
case
i
must
of
course
go
up
to
london
and
back
on
saturday
a
shower
of
rain
caused
them
some
discomfort
through
the
afternoon
it
still
rained
at
intervals
whilst
barfoot
was
discharging
his
business
at
gosforth
he
was
to
see
rhoda
again
at
eight
and
as
the
time
threatened
to
hang
heavily
on
his
hands
he
returned
by
a
long
detour
reaching
the
seascale
hotel
about
six
no
sooner
had
he
entered
than
there
was
delivered
to
him
a
letter
brought
by
messenger
an
hour
or
two
ago
it
surprised
him
to
recognize
writing
on
the
envelope
which
seemed
to
contain
at
least
two
sheets
of
notepaper
what
now
some
whimsey
agitated
and
annoyed
by
the
anticipation
of
trouble
he
went
apart
and
broke
the
letter
open
first
appeared
an
enclosure
a
letter
in
his
cousin
mary
writing
he
turned
to
the
other
sheet
and
read
these
lines
send
you
something
that
has
come
by
post
this
afternoon
please
to
bring
it
with
you
when
you
meet
me
at
eight
if
you
still
care
to
do
so
his
face
flushed
with
anger
what
contemptible
woman
folly
was
this
you
still
care
to
do
so
and
written
in
a
hand
that
shook
if
this
was
to
be
his
experience
of
matrimonial
engagement
what
rubbish
had
mary
been
communicating
dear
rhoda
i
have
just
gone
through
a
very
painful
scene
and
i
feel
bound
to
let
you
know
of
it
without
delay
as
it
concern
you
this
evening
monday
when
i
came
home
from
great
portland
street
emma
told
me
that
widdowson
had
called
that
he
wished
to
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
and
would
be
here
again
at
six
he
came
and
his
appearance
alarmed
me
he
was
looking
so
dreadfully
ill
without
preface
he
said
my
wife
has
left
me
she
has
gone
to
her
sister
and
refuses
to
return
this
was
astonishing
in
itself
and
i
wondered
still
more
why
he
should
come
and
tell
about
it
in
so
strange
a
way
the
explanation
followed
very
promptly
and
you
may
judge
how
i
heard
it
widdowson
said
that
his
wife
had
been
behaving
very
badly
of
late
that
he
had
discovered
several
falsehoods
she
had
told
him
as
to
her
employment
during
absences
from
home
in
daytime
and
evening
having
cause
for
suspecting
the
worst
he
last
saturday
engaged
a
private
detective
to
follow
widdowson
wherever
she
went
this
man
saw
her
go
to
the
flats
in
bayswater
where
everard
lives
and
knock
at
door
as
no
one
replied
she
went
away
for
a
time
and
returned
but
again
found
no
one
at
home
this
being
at
once
reported
to
widdowson
he
asked
his
wife
where
she
had
been
that
afternoon
the
answer
was
false
she
said
she
had
been
here
with
me
thereupon
he
lost
command
of
himself
and
charged
her
with
infidelity
she
refused
to
offer
any
kind
of
explanation
but
denied
that
she
was
guilty
and
at
once
left
the
house
since
she
has
utterly
refused
to
see
him
her
sister
can
only
report
that
monica
is
very
ill
and
that
she
charges
her
husband
with
accusing
her
falsely
had
come
to
me
he
said
in
unspeakable
anguish
and
helplessness
to
ask
me
whether
i
had
seen
anything
suspicious
in
the
relations
between
monica
and
my
cousin
when
they
met
at
this
house
or
elsewhere
a
nice
question
of
course
i
could
only
reply
that
it
had
never
even
occurred
to
me
to
observe
them
that
to
my
knowledge
they
had
met
so
rarely
and
that
i
should
never
have
dreamt
of
suspecting
monica
yet
you
see
she
be
guilty
he
kept
on
repeating
i
said
no
that
i
thought
her
visit
have
an
innocent
significance
though
i
could
suggest
why
she
had
told
falsehoods
then
he
inquired
what
i
knew
about
everard
present
movements
i
answered
that
i
had
every
reason
to
think
that
he
was
out
of
town
but
did
know
when
he
went
or
when
he
might
be
expected
to
return
the
poor
man
was
grievously
dissatisfied
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
in
a
base
plot
against
him
it
was
an
immense
relief
when
he
went
away
after
begging
me
to
respect
his
confidence
write
very
hurriedly
as
you
see
that
i
to
write
is
i
think
clear
though
i
may
be
doing
lamentable
mischief
i
can
not
credit
this
charge
against
widdowson
there
must
surely
be
some
explanation
if
you
have
already
left
seascale
no
doubt
this
letter
will
be
ever
yours
dear
rhoda
mary
barfoot
everard
laughed
bitterly
the
completeness
of
the
case
against
him
in
rhoda
eyes
must
be
so
overwhelming
and
his
absolute
innocence
made
it
exasperating
to
have
to
defend
himself
how
indeed
was
he
to
defend
himself
the
story
was
strange
enough
could
he
be
right
in
the
interpretation
which
at
once
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
or
perhaps
to
his
vanity
he
remembered
the
meeting
with
widdowson
near
his
abode
on
friday
he
recollected
moreover
the
signs
of
interest
in
himself
which
as
he
now
thought
she
had
shown
on
previous
occasions
had
the
poor
little
woman
doubtless
miserable
with
her
husband
actually
let
herself
fall
in
love
with
him
but
even
in
that
case
what
a
reckless
thing
to
do
to
come
to
his
rooms
why
she
must
have
been
driven
by
a
despair
that
blinded
her
to
all
sense
of
delicacy
perhaps
had
he
been
at
home
she
would
have
made
a
pretence
of
wishing
to
speak
about
rhoda
nunn
that
was
imprudent
behaviour
of
his
making
such
a
person
his
confidante
but
he
was
tempted
by
his
liking
for
her
jove
he
muttered
overcome
by
the
thought
glad
i
was
at
home
but
then
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
going
away
on
saturday
how
could
she
expect
to
find
him
the
hour
of
her
visit
was
not
stated
probably
she
hoped
to
catch
him
before
he
left
and
was
her
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
on
friday
her
troubled
aspect
to
be
explained
as
an
abortive
attempt
to
have
a
private
interview
with
him
the
queerest
affair
and
maddening
in
its
issues
rhoda
was
raging
with
jealousy
well
he
too
would
rage
and
without
affectation
it
was
strange
that
he
felt
almost
glad
of
a
ground
of
quarrel
with
rhoda
all
day
he
had
been
in
an
irritable
temper
and
so
far
as
he
could
understand
himself
it
was
due
to
resentment
of
his
last
night
defeat
he
though
of
rhoda
as
ardently
as
ever
but
an
element
that
was
very
like
brutality
had
intruded
into
his
emotions
that
was
his
reason
from
refraining
from
caresses
this
morning
he
could
not
trust
himself
he
would
endure
no
absurdities
if
rhoda
did
not
choose
to
accept
his
simple
assurance
let
her
take
the
consequences
even
now
perhaps
he
would
bring
her
to
her
knees
before
him
let
her
wrong
him
by
baseless
accusation
then
it
would
no
longer
be
who
sued
for
favour
he
would
whistle
her
down
the
wind
and
await
her
penitent
reappearance
sooner
or
later
his
pride
and
hers
the
obstinacy
in
their
natures
must
battle
it
out
better
that
it
should
be
now
before
the
irrevocable
step
had
been
taken
he
ate
his
dinner
with
savage
appetite
and
drank
a
good
deal
more
wine
than
of
wont
then
he
smoked
until
the
last
minute
of
delay
that
his
engagement
allowed
of
course
she
had
sent
the
letter
to
the
hotel
because
he
might
be
unable
to
read
it
in
twilight
wise
precaution
and
he
was
glad
to
have
been
able
to
think
the
matter
over
to
work
himself
into
reasonable
wrath
if
ever
man
did
well
to
be
angry
there
she
was
down
by
the
edge
of
the
waves
she
would
not
turn
to
see
if
he
were
coming
he
felt
sure
of
that
whether
she
heard
his
footsteps
he
could
not
tell
when
quite
close
to
her
he
exclaimed
rhoda
she
must
have
known
of
his
approach
for
she
gave
no
start
she
faced
slowly
to
him
no
trace
of
tears
on
her
countenance
no
rhoda
was
above
that
gravity
of
the
sternest
that
was
all
he
continued
have
you
to
say
to
me
nothing
mean
that
it
is
my
business
to
explain
what
mary
has
told
you
i
ca
so
there
an
end
of
it
do
you
mean
by
that
she
asked
in
clear
distant
tones
what
i
say
rhoda
and
i
am
obliged
to
ask
what
mean
by
this
odd
way
of
speaking
to
me
what
has
happened
since
we
parted
this
morning
rhoda
could
not
suppress
her
astonishment
she
gazed
fixedly
at
him
you
ca
explain
this
letter
who
can
suppose
widdowson
would
be
able
to
account
for
her
doings
i
certainly
am
not
able
to
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
strangely
forgetful
of
something
that
passed
between
us
yesterday
what
she
asked
coldly
her
face
which
was
held
proudly
up
turning
towards
the
sea
you
accuse
me
of
concealing
something
from
you
please
to
remember
a
certain
plain
question
you
asked
me
and
the
equally
plain
answer
i
gave
he
detected
the
beginning
of
a
smile
about
her
rigid
lips
remember
she
said
you
can
still
behave
to
me
with
indignation
surely
the
indignation
should
be
on
my
side
you
are
telling
me
that
i
deceived
you
for
a
moment
rhoda
lost
her
can
i
help
thinking
so
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
misery
can
this
letter
mean
why
should
she
go
to
your
rooms
simply
do
know
rhoda
he
preserved
the
show
of
calmness
just
because
he
saw
that
it
provoked
her
to
anger
has
never
been
there
before
to
my
knowledge
rhoda
watched
his
face
with
greedy
attention
she
seemed
to
find
there
a
confirmation
of
her
doubts
indeed
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
credit
his
denials
after
what
she
had
observed
in
london
and
the
circumstances
which
even
before
mary
letter
had
made
her
suspicious
did
you
last
see
mrs
widdowson
i
sha
consent
to
be
replied
everard
with
a
disdainful
smile
soon
as
you
refuse
to
accept
my
word
it
folly
to
ask
further
questions
you
do
believe
me
say
it
honestly
and
let
us
understand
each
other
have
good
reason
for
thinking
that
you
could
explain
widdowson
behaviour
if
you
chose
there
no
misunderstanding
and
if
i
get
angry
i
am
an
unpardonable
brute
come
now
you
ca
be
offended
if
i
treat
you
as
simply
my
equal
rhoda
let
me
test
your
sincerity
suppose
i
had
seen
you
talking
somewhere
with
some
man
who
seemed
to
interest
you
very
much
and
then
let
us
say
i
heard
that
he
had
called
upon
you
when
you
were
alone
i
turn
with
a
savage
face
and
accuse
you
of
grossly
deceiving
me
in
the
worst
sense
what
would
your
answer
be
are
idle
suppositions
she
exclaimed
scornfully
the
case
is
possible
you
must
admit
i
want
you
to
realize
what
i
am
feeling
in
such
a
case
as
that
you
could
only
turn
from
me
with
contempt
how
else
can
i
behave
to
conscious
of
my
innocence
yet
in
the
nature
of
things
unable
to
prove
it
are
very
strongly
against
you
an
accident
to
me
quite
unaccountable
if
i
charged
you
with
dishonour
you
would
only
have
your
word
to
offer
in
reply
so
it
is
with
me
and
my
word
is
bluntly
rejected
you
try
me
rather
severely
rhoda
kept
silence
know
what
you
are
thinking
my
character
was
previously
none
of
the
best
there
is
a
prejudice
against
me
in
such
a
matter
as
you
shall
hear
some
more
plain
speech
altogether
for
your
good
my
record
is
not
immaculate
nor
i
believe
is
any
i
have
gone
here
and
there
and
have
had
my
adventures
like
other
men
one
of
them
you
have
heard
about
the
story
of
that
girl
amy
drake
the
subject
of
goodall
righteous
wrath
you
shall
know
the
truth
and
if
it
offends
your
ears
i
ca
help
it
the
girl
simply
threw
herself
into
my
arms
on
a
railway
journey
when
we
met
by
pure
chance
do
care
to
hear
that
said
rhoda
turning
away
you
hear
it
that
story
has
predisposed
you
to
believe
the
worst
things
of
me
if
i
hold
you
by
force
you
shall
hear
every
word
of
it
mary
seems
to
have
given
you
mere
dark
hints
she
has
told
me
the
details
i
know
it
all
their
point
of
view
very
well
that
saves
me
a
lot
of
narrative
what
those
good
people
did
understand
was
the
girl
character
they
thought
her
a
helpless
innocent
she
was
a
i
spare
you
the
word
she
simply
planned
to
get
me
into
her
power
thought
i
should
be
forced
to
marry
her
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
happens
far
oftener
than
you
would
suppose
that
the
reason
why
men
so
often
smile
in
what
you
would
call
a
brutal
way
when
certain
stories
are
told
to
other
discredit
you
will
have
to
take
this
into
account
rhoda
before
you
reach
satisfactory
results
on
the
questions
that
have
occupied
you
so
much
i
was
not
in
the
least
responsible
for
amy
drake
desertion
of
creditable
paths
at
the
worst
i
behaved
foolishly
and
knowing
i
had
done
so
knowing
how
thankless
it
was
to
try
and
clear
myself
at
her
expense
i
let
people
say
what
they
would
it
did
matter
and
you
do
believe
me
i
can
see
you
do
sexual
pride
wo
let
you
believe
me
in
such
a
case
the
man
must
necessarily
be
the
villain
you
mean
by
saying
you
only
behaved
foolishly
i
understand
not
and
i
ca
explain
as
i
once
did
in
telling
the
story
to
a
man
a
friend
of
mine
but
however
strict
your
moral
ideas
you
will
admit
that
a
girl
of
thoroughly
bad
character
is
a
subject
for
the
outcry
that
was
raised
about
miss
amy
drake
by
taking
a
little
trouble
i
could
have
brought
things
to
light
which
would
have
given
worthy
goodall
and
cousin
mary
a
great
shock
well
that
enough
i
have
never
pretended
to
sanctity
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
never
behaved
like
a
scoundrel
you
charge
me
deliberately
with
being
a
scoundrel
and
i
defend
myself
as
best
i
can
you
argue
that
the
man
who
would
mislead
an
innocent
girl
and
then
cast
her
off
is
more
likely
than
not
to
be
guilty
in
a
case
like
this
of
widdowson
when
appearances
are
decidedly
against
him
there
is
only
my
word
in
each
instance
the
question
is
will
you
accept
my
word
for
a
wonder
their
privacy
was
threatened
by
the
approach
of
two
men
who
were
walking
this
way
from
seascale
voices
in
conversation
caused
rhoda
to
look
round
barfoot
had
already
observed
the
strangers
us
go
up
on
to
the
higher
sand
he
said
without
reply
rhoda
accompanied
him
and
for
several
minutes
they
exchanged
no
word
the
men
talking
and
laughing
loudly
went
by
they
seemed
to
be
tourists
of
a
kind
that
do
not
often
trouble
this
quiet
spot
on
the
coast
their
cigars
glowed
in
the
dusk
all
this
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
rhoda
you
please
to
give
me
your
cousin
letter
she
said
coldly
it
is
now
you
will
go
back
to
your
lodgings
and
sit
with
that
letter
open
before
you
half
through
the
night
you
will
make
yourself
unutterably
wretched
and
all
for
what
he
felt
himself
once
more
in
danger
of
weakness
rhoda
in
her
haughty
resentful
mood
was
very
attractive
to
him
he
was
tempted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
until
she
softened
pleaded
with
him
he
wished
to
see
her
shed
tears
but
the
voice
in
which
she
now
spoke
to
him
was
far
enough
from
tearfulness
must
prove
to
me
that
you
have
been
wrongly
suspected
ah
that
was
to
be
her
line
of
conduct
she
believed
her
power
over
him
was
absolute
she
stood
on
her
dignity
would
bring
him
to
supplication
would
give
him
all
the
trouble
she
could
before
she
professed
herself
satisfied
am
i
to
prove
it
he
asked
bluntly
there
was
nothing
wrong
between
you
and
widdowson
there
must
be
some
very
simple
explanation
of
her
coming
to
your
rooms
and
being
so
anxious
to
see
you
is
it
my
business
to
discover
that
explanation
it
be
mine
must
either
be
yours
rhoda
or
no
one
i
shall
take
no
single
step
in
the
matter
the
battle
was
declared
each
stood
at
full
height
pertinacious
resolved
on
victory
are
putting
yourself
wildly
in
the
wrong
everard
continued
refusing
to
take
my
word
you
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
hope
that
we
could
live
together
as
we
imagined
the
words
fell
upon
her
heart
like
a
crushing
weight
but
she
could
not
yield
last
night
she
had
suffered
in
his
opinion
by
urging
what
he
thought
a
weak
womanly
scruple
she
had
condescended
to
plead
tenderly
with
him
and
had
won
her
cause
now
she
would
prevail
in
another
way
if
he
were
telling
the
truth
he
should
acknowledge
that
natural
suspicion
made
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
clear
so
strange
a
case
of
its
difficulties
if
he
were
guilty
of
deception
as
she
still
believed
though
willing
to
admit
to
herself
that
monica
might
be
most
at
fault
that
there
might
have
been
no
actual
wrongdoing
between
them
he
should
confess
with
humblest
penitence
and
beseech
pardon
impossible
to
take
any
other
attitude
impossible
to
marry
him
with
this
doubt
in
her
mind
equally
out
of
the
question
to
seek
monica
and
humiliate
herself
by
making
inquiries
on
such
a
subject
guilty
or
not
monica
would
regard
her
with
secret
disdain
with
woman
malice
were
she
to
believe
him
that
indeed
would
be
a
grand
consummation
of
their
love
an
ideal
union
of
heart
and
soul
listening
to
him
she
had
tried
to
put
faith
in
his
indignant
words
but
it
was
useless
the
incredulity
she
could
not
help
must
either
part
them
for
ever
or
be
to
her
an
occasion
of
new
triumph
do
refuse
to
take
your
word
she
said
with
conscious
quibbling
only
say
that
your
name
must
be
cleared
from
suspicion
widdowson
is
sure
to
tell
his
story
to
other
people
why
has
his
wife
left
him
neither
know
nor
care
must
prove
to
me
that
you
are
not
the
cause
of
it
shall
not
make
the
slightest
effort
to
do
so
rhoda
began
to
move
away
from
him
as
he
kept
silence
she
walked
on
in
the
seascale
direction
he
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
few
yards
watching
her
movements
when
they
had
gone
so
far
that
five
minutes
more
must
bring
them
within
sight
of
the
hotel
everard
spoke
she
paused
and
awaited
him
remember
that
i
was
going
to
london
it
seems
that
i
had
better
go
and
not
trouble
to
return
is
for
you
to
decide
you
rather
have
said
all
that
i
say
so
have
i
but
surely
you
must
be
unconscious
how
grossly
you
are
insulting
me
want
only
to
understand
what
purpose
widdowson
had
in
going
to
your
rooms
why
not
ask
her
you
are
friends
she
would
doubtless
tell
you
the
truth
she
comes
to
me
voluntarily
to
make
an
explanation
i
will
hear
it
but
i
shall
not
ask
her
view
of
the
fitness
of
things
is
that
i
should
request
her
to
wait
upon
you
for
that
purpose
are
others
who
can
act
for
you
well
then
we
are
at
a
deadlock
it
seems
to
me
that
we
had
better
shake
hands
like
sensible
people
and
say
better
if
it
seems
so
to
you
the
time
for
emotional
help
was
past
in
very
truth
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
being
now
hardened
in
obstinacy
each
suffered
from
the
other
coldness
each
felt
angry
with
the
stubborn
refusal
to
concede
a
point
of
dignity
everard
put
out
his
hand
you
are
ready
to
say
that
you
have
used
me
very
ill
i
shall
remember
only
yesterday
till
then
rhoda
she
made
a
show
of
taking
his
hand
but
said
nothing
and
so
they
parted
at
eight
next
morning
barfoot
was
seated
in
the
southward
train
he
rejoiced
that
his
strength
of
will
had
thus
far
asserted
itself
of
final
farewell
to
rhoda
he
had
no
thought
whatever
her
curiosity
would
of
course
compel
her
to
see
monica
one
way
or
another
she
would
learn
that
he
was
blameless
his
part
was
to
keep
aloof
from
her
and
to
wait
for
her
inevitable
submission
violent
rain
was
beating
upon
the
carriage
windows
it
drove
from
the
mountains
themselves
invisible
though
dense
low
clouds
marked
their
position
poor
rhoda
she
would
not
have
a
very
cheerful
day
at
seascale
perhaps
she
would
follow
him
by
a
later
train
certain
it
was
that
she
must
be
suffering
intensely
and
that
certainly
rejoiced
him
the
keener
her
suffering
the
sooner
her
submission
oh
but
the
submission
should
be
perfect
he
had
seen
her
in
many
moods
but
not
yet
in
the
anguish
of
broken
pride
she
must
shed
tears
before
him
declare
her
spirit
worn
and
subjugated
by
torment
of
jealousy
and
fear
then
he
would
raise
her
and
seat
her
in
the
place
of
honour
and
fall
down
at
her
feet
and
fill
her
soul
with
rapture
many
times
between
seascale
and
london
he
smiled
in
anticipation
of
that
hour
chapter
xxvii
the
reascent
whilst
the
rain
pelted
and
it
did
so
until
afternoon
rhoda
sat
in
her
little
parlour
no
whit
less
miserable
than
barfoot
imagined
she
could
not
be
sure
whether
everard
had
gone
to
london
at
the
last
moment
reflection
or
emotion
might
have
detained
him
early
in
the
morning
she
had
sent
to
post
a
letter
for
miss
barfoot
written
last
night
a
letter
which
made
no
revelation
of
her
feelings
but
merely
expressed
a
cold
curiosity
to
hear
anything
that
might
become
known
as
to
the
course
of
widdowson
domestic
troubles
may
still
write
to
this
address
if
i
leave
letters
shall
be
forwarded
when
the
sky
cleared
she
went
out
in
the
evening
she
again
rambled
about
the
shore
evidently
barfoot
had
gone
if
still
here
he
would
have
watched
and
joined
her
her
solitude
now
grew
insufferable
yet
she
could
not
decide
whither
to
betake
herself
the
temptation
to
return
to
london
was
very
strong
but
pride
prevailed
against
it
everard
might
perhaps
go
to
see
his
cousin
and
relate
all
that
had
happened
at
seascale
justifying
himself
as
he
had
here
done
whether
miss
barfoot
became
aware
of
the
story
or
not
rhoda
could
not
reconcile
it
with
her
to
curtail
the
stipulated
three
weeks
of
holiday
rather
she
would
strain
her
nerves
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
and
if
she
were
not
suffering
then
never
did
woman
suffer
another
cheerless
day
helped
her
to
make
up
her
mind
she
cared
nothing
now
for
lake
and
mountain
human
companionship
was
her
supreme
need
by
the
earliest
train
next
day
she
started
not
for
london
but
for
her
brother
home
in
somerset
and
there
she
remained
until
it
was
time
to
return
to
work
miss
barfoot
wrote
twice
in
the
interval
saying
that
she
had
heard
nothing
more
of
monica
of
everard
she
made
no
mention
rhoda
got
back
again
to
chelsea
on
the
appointed
saturday
afternoon
miss
barfoot
knew
when
she
would
arrive
but
was
not
at
home
to
meet
her
and
did
not
return
till
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
they
met
at
length
as
if
nothing
remarkable
had
occurred
during
the
three
weeks
mary
if
she
felt
any
solicitude
effectually
concealed
it
rhoda
talked
as
if
very
glad
to
be
at
home
again
explaining
her
desertion
of
the
lake
country
by
the
bad
weather
that
prevailed
there
it
was
not
till
after
dinner
that
the
inevitable
subject
came
up
between
them
you
seen
everard
since
you
went
away
miss
barfoot
began
by
asking
so
he
had
not
been
here
to
tell
his
story
and
plead
his
cause
or
it
seemed
not
i
saw
him
at
seascale
rhoda
replied
without
sign
of
emotion
or
after
that
news
came
before
and
after
i
showed
him
your
letter
and
all
he
had
to
say
was
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
all
he
has
to
say
to
me
i
have
seen
him
a
letter
i
sent
to
his
address
was
answered
after
a
week
from
a
place
i
never
heard
of
arromanches
in
normandy
the
shortest
and
rudest
letter
i
ever
had
from
him
practically
he
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
and
there
things
stand
rhoda
smiled
a
little
conscious
of
the
extreme
curiosity
her
friend
must
be
feeling
and
determined
not
to
gratify
it
for
by
this
time
though
her
sunken
cheeks
were
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
summer
holiday
she
had
matured
a
resolve
to
betray
nothing
of
what
she
had
gone
through
her
state
of
mind
resembled
that
of
the
ascetic
who
has
arrived
at
a
morbid
delight
in
she
regarded
the
world
with
an
intense
bitterness
and
persuaded
herself
not
only
that
the
thought
of
everard
barfoot
was
hateful
to
her
soul
but
that
sexual
love
had
become
and
would
ever
be
to
her
an
impure
idea
a
vice
of
blood
suppose
she
said
carelessly
widdowson
will
try
to
divorce
his
wife
am
in
dread
of
that
but
they
may
have
made
it
up
course
you
have
no
doubt
of
her
guilt
mary
tried
to
understand
the
hard
austere
face
with
its
touch
of
cynicism
conjecture
as
to
its
meaning
was
not
difficult
but
in
the
utter
absence
of
information
certainty
there
could
be
none
under
any
circumstances
it
was
to
be
expected
that
rhoda
would
think
and
speak
of
widdowson
no
less
severely
than
of
the
errant
bella
royston
have
doubt
was
miss
barfoot
answer
i
should
be
glad
of
some
one
else
favourable
opinion
to
help
my
charity
madden
has
been
here
you
see
she
certainly
would
have
come
if
she
had
felt
convinced
that
her
sister
was
wronged
a
day
or
two
saw
the
end
of
the
trouble
when
naturally
none
of
them
would
say
any
more
about
it
this
was
the
possibility
which
occupied
rhoda
reflections
as
long
as
she
lay
awake
that
night
her
feelings
on
entering
the
familiar
bedroom
were
very
strange
even
before
starting
for
her
holiday
she
had
bidden
it
and
at
seascale
that
night
following
upon
the
perfect
day
she
had
thought
of
it
as
a
part
of
her
past
life
a
place
abandoned
for
ever
already
infinitely
remote
her
first
sensation
when
she
looked
upon
the
white
bed
was
one
of
disgust
she
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
use
this
room
henceforth
and
that
she
must
ask
miss
barfoot
to
let
her
change
to
another
tonight
she
did
not
restore
any
of
the
ornaments
which
were
lying
packed
up
the
scent
of
the
room
revived
so
many
hours
of
conflict
of
hope
that
it
caused
her
a
sick
faintness
in
frenzy
of
detestation
she
cursed
the
man
who
had
so
disturbed
and
sullied
the
swift
pure
stream
of
her
life
arromanches
in
normandy
on
sunday
she
sought
the
name
on
a
map
but
it
was
not
marked
being
doubtless
too
insignificant
improbable
that
he
had
gone
to
such
a
place
alone
he
was
enjoying
himself
with
friends
careless
what
became
of
her
having
allowed
all
this
time
to
go
by
he
would
never
seek
her
again
he
found
that
her
will
was
the
equal
of
his
own
and
as
he
could
not
rule
her
she
was
numbered
among
the
women
who
had
afforded
him
interesting
experiences
to
be
thought
of
seriously
no
more
during
the
next
week
she
threw
herself
with
energy
upon
her
work
stifling
the
repugnance
with
which
at
first
it
affected
her
and
seeming
at
length
to
recover
the
old
enthusiasm
this
was
the
only
way
of
salvation
idleness
and
absence
of
purpose
would
soon
degrade
her
in
a
sense
she
had
never
dreamt
of
she
made
a
plan
of
daily
occupation
which
by
leaving
not
a
vacant
moment
from
early
morning
to
late
at
night
should
give
her
the
sleep
of
utter
weariness
new
studies
were
begun
in
the
hour
or
two
before
breakfast
she
even
restricted
her
diet
and
ate
only
just
enough
to
support
life
rejecting
wine
and
everything
that
was
most
agreeable
to
her
palate
she
desired
to
speak
privately
with
mildred
vesper
and
opportunity
might
have
been
made
but
as
part
of
her
scheme
of
this
conversation
was
postponed
until
the
second
week
it
took
place
one
evening
when
work
was
over
have
been
wanting
to
ask
you
rhoda
began
you
have
any
news
of
mrs
widdowson
wrote
to
her
not
long
ago
and
she
answered
from
a
new
address
she
said
she
had
left
her
husband
and
would
never
go
back
to
him
rhoda
nodded
gravely
what
i
had
heard
was
true
you
have
seen
her
asked
me
not
to
come
she
is
living
with
her
sister
she
give
you
any
reason
for
the
separation
from
her
husband
answered
mildred
she
said
it
was
no
secret
that
every
one
knew
that
why
i
have
spoken
to
you
about
it
as
i
should
have
done
otherwise
after
our
last
conversation
fact
is
no
secret
said
rhoda
coldly
why
will
she
offer
no
explanation
mildred
shook
her
head
signifying
inability
to
make
any
satisfactory
reply
and
there
the
dialogue
ended
for
rhoda
could
not
proceed
in
it
without
appearing
to
encourage
scandal
the
hope
of
eliciting
some
suggestive
information
had
failed
but
whether
mildred
had
really
disclosed
all
she
knew
seemed
doubtful
at
the
end
of
the
week
miss
barfoot
left
home
for
her
own
holiday
she
was
going
to
scotland
and
would
be
away
for
nearly
the
whole
of
september
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
work
in
great
portland
street
was
very
light
not
much
employment
offered
for
the
typewriters
and
the
pupils
numbered
only
about
half
a
dozen
nevertheless
it
pleased
rhoda
to
have
the
establishment
under
her
sole
direction
she
desired
authority
and
by
magnifying
the
importance
of
that
which
now
fell
into
her
hands
she
endeavoured
to
sustain
herself
under
the
secret
misery
which
for
all
her
efforts
weighed
no
less
upon
her
as
time
went
on
it
was
a
dreary
on
the
first
night
of
solitude
at
chelsea
she
shed
bitter
tears
and
not
only
wept
but
agonized
in
mute
frenzy
the
passions
of
her
flesh
torturing
her
until
she
thought
of
death
as
a
refuge
now
she
whispered
the
name
of
her
lover
with
every
word
and
phrase
of
endearment
that
her
heart
could
suggest
the
next
moment
she
cursed
him
with
the
fury
of
deadliest
hatred
in
the
of
sleeplessness
she
revolved
wild
impossible
schemes
for
revenging
herself
or
as
the
mood
changed
all
but
resolved
to
sacrifice
everything
to
her
love
to
accuse
herself
of
ignoble
jealousy
and
entreat
forgiveness
of
many
woeful
nights
this
was
the
worst
she
had
yet
suffered
it
recalled
to
her
with
much
vividness
a
memory
of
girlhood
or
indeed
of
childhood
she
thought
of
that
figure
in
the
dim
past
that
rugged
man
who
had
given
her
the
first
suggestion
of
independence
thrice
her
own
age
yet
the
inspirer
of
such
tumultuous
emotion
in
her
ignorant
heart
her
friend
at
clevedon
smithson
a
question
from
mary
barfoot
had
caused
her
to
glance
back
at
him
across
the
years
but
only
for
an
instant
and
with
what
she
now
endured
was
the
ripe
intensity
of
a
woe
that
fell
upon
her
at
fifteen
when
smithson
passed
from
her
sight
and
away
for
ever
childish
folly
but
the
misery
of
it
the
tossing
at
night
the
blank
outlook
how
contemptible
to
revive
such
sensations
with
mature
intellect
after
so
long
and
stern
a
discipline
dreading
the
sunday
so
terrible
in
its
depressing
effect
upon
the
lonely
and
unhappy
she
breakfasted
as
soon
as
possible
and
left
home
simply
to
walk
to
exert
herself
physically
that
fatigue
and
sleep
might
follow
there
was
a
dull
sky
but
no
immediate
fear
of
rain
the
weather
brightened
a
little
towards
noon
careless
of
the
direction
she
walked
on
and
on
until
the
last
maddening
church
bell
had
ceased
its
clangour
she
was
far
out
in
the
western
suburbs
and
weariness
began
to
check
her
quick
pace
then
she
turned
back
without
intending
it
she
passed
by
cosgrove
house
or
rather
would
have
passed
when
she
saw
cosgrove
at
the
window
making
signs
to
her
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
and
she
went
in
she
was
glad
of
this
accident
for
the
social
lady
might
have
something
to
tell
about
widdowson
who
often
visited
her
mercy
come
and
talk
to
me
exclaimed
cosgrove
am
quite
alone
and
feel
as
if
i
could
hang
myself
are
you
obliged
to
go
anywhere
i
was
having
a
walk
walk
what
astonishing
energy
it
never
occurs
to
me
to
take
a
walk
in
london
i
came
from
the
country
last
night
and
expected
to
find
my
sister
here
but
she
wo
arrive
till
tuesday
i
have
been
standing
at
the
window
for
an
hour
getting
crazy
with
they
went
to
the
it
was
not
long
before
cosgrove
made
an
allusion
which
enabled
rhoda
to
speak
of
widdowson
for
a
month
or
more
cosgrove
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
of
her
she
had
been
out
of
town
all
the
time
rhoda
hesitated
but
could
not
keep
silence
on
the
subject
that
had
become
a
morbid
preoccupation
of
her
mind
she
told
as
much
as
she
knew
excepting
the
suspicion
against
everard
barfoot
does
in
the
least
surprise
me
said
the
listener
with
interest
saw
they
would
be
able
to
live
together
very
well
without
children
the
thing
was
impossible
of
course
she
has
told
you
all
about
it
have
seen
her
since
it
happened
you
know
i
always
have
a
distinct
feeling
of
pleasure
when
i
hear
of
married
people
parting
how
horrible
that
would
seem
to
some
of
our
good
friends
but
it
is
a
malicious
pleasure
there
nothing
personal
in
it
as
i
have
told
you
before
i
think
i
led
a
very
contented
life
with
my
husband
but
marriage
in
general
is
a
humbug
you
forgive
the
word
course
it
is
assented
rhoda
laughing
with
forced
gaiety
am
glad
of
anything
that
seems
to
threaten
it
as
an
institution
in
its
present
form
a
scandalous
divorce
case
is
a
delight
to
me
anything
that
makes
it
evident
how
much
misery
would
be
spared
if
we
could
civilize
ourselves
in
this
respect
there
are
women
whose
conduct
i
think
personally
detestable
and
whom
yet
i
ca
help
thanking
for
their
assault
upon
social
laws
we
shall
have
to
go
through
a
stage
of
anarchy
you
know
before
reconstruction
begins
yes
in
that
sense
i
am
an
anarchist
seriously
i
believe
if
a
few
men
and
women
in
prominent
position
would
contract
marriage
of
the
free
kind
without
priest
or
lawyer
open
and
defiantly
they
would
do
more
benefit
to
their
kind
than
in
any
other
possible
way
i
do
declare
this
opinion
to
every
one
but
only
because
i
am
a
coward
whatever
one
believes
with
heart
and
soul
one
ought
to
make
known
rhoda
wore
a
look
of
anxious
reflection
needs
a
great
deal
of
courage
she
said
take
that
step
i
mean
course
we
need
martyrs
and
yet
i
doubt
whether
the
martyrdom
would
be
very
long
or
very
trying
to
intellectual
people
a
woman
of
brains
who
boldly
acted
upon
her
conviction
would
have
no
lack
of
congenial
society
the
best
people
are
getting
more
liberal
than
they
care
to
confess
to
each
other
wait
until
some
one
puts
the
matter
to
the
test
and
you
will
see
rhoda
became
so
busy
with
her
tumultuous
thoughts
that
she
spoke
only
a
word
now
and
then
allowing
cosgrove
to
talk
at
large
on
this
engrossing
theme
is
widdowson
living
the
revolutionist
at
length
inquired
do
know
but
i
can
get
you
her
address
do
i
shall
go
and
see
her
we
are
quite
friendly
enough
for
me
to
do
so
without
impertinence
having
lunched
with
her
acquaintance
rhoda
went
in
the
afternoon
to
mildred
vesper
lodgings
miss
vesper
was
at
home
reading
in
her
usual
placid
mood
she
gave
rhoda
the
address
that
was
on
widdowson
last
brief
note
and
that
evening
rhoda
sent
it
to
cosgrove
by
letter
in
two
days
she
received
a
reply
cosgrove
had
called
upon
widdowson
at
her
lodgings
at
clapham
is
ill
wretched
and
unwilling
to
talk
i
could
only
stay
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
to
ask
questions
was
impossible
she
mentioned
your
name
and
appeared
very
anxious
to
hear
about
you
but
when
i
asked
whether
she
would
like
you
to
call
she
grew
timid
all
at
once
and
said
she
hoped
you
unless
you
really
desired
to
see
her
poor
thing
of
course
i
know
what
it
all
means
but
i
came
away
with
maledictions
on
marriage
in
my
heart
one
is
always
safe
in
indulging
that
feeling
a
week
or
so
after
this
there
arrived
for
miss
barfoot
a
letter
from
everard
the
postmark
was
ostend
never
before
had
rhoda
been
tempted
to
commit
a
break
of
confidence
such
as
in
any
one
else
she
would
have
scorned
beyond
measure
she
had
heard
of
course
of
people
secretly
opening
letters
with
the
help
of
steam
whether
it
could
be
done
with
absolute
security
from
detection
she
did
not
feel
sure
but
her
thoughts
dwelt
on
the
subject
for
several
hours
it
was
terrible
to
hold
this
letter
of
writing
and
yet
be
obliged
to
send
it
away
without
knowledge
of
the
contents
which
perhaps
gravely
concerned
her
she
could
not
ask
miss
barfoot
to
let
her
know
what
everard
had
written
the
information
might
perhaps
be
voluntarily
granted
but
perhaps
not
to
steam
the
back
of
the
envelope
would
it
not
leave
marks
a
rumpling
or
discoloration
even
to
be
suspected
of
such
dishonour
would
be
more
bitter
to
her
than
death
could
she
even
think
of
it
how
she
was
degraded
by
this
hateful
passion
which
wrought
in
her
like
a
disease
with
two
others
which
that
day
had
arrived
she
put
the
letter
into
a
large
envelope
and
so
dispatched
it
but
no
satisfaction
rewarded
her
her
heart
raged
against
the
world
against
every
law
of
life
when
in
a
few
days
a
letter
came
to
her
from
miss
barfoot
she
tore
it
open
and
there
yes
there
was
everard
handwriting
mary
had
sent
the
communication
for
her
to
read
cousin
mary
after
all
i
was
rather
too
grumpy
in
my
last
note
to
you
but
my
patience
had
been
desperately
tried
i
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
now
at
last
i
am
recovering
sanity
and
can
admit
that
you
had
no
choice
but
to
ask
those
questions
i
know
and
care
nothing
about
widdowson
by
her
eccentric
behaviour
she
either
did
me
a
great
injury
or
a
great
service
i
not
quite
sure
which
but
i
incline
to
the
latter
view
here
is
a
conundrum
not
very
difficult
to
solve
i
dare
say
you
know
anything
about
arromanches
a
very
quiet
little
spot
on
the
normandy
coast
you
get
to
it
by
an
hour
coach
from
bayeux
not
infested
by
english
i
went
there
on
an
invitation
from
the
brissendens
who
discovered
the
place
last
year
excellent
people
these
i
like
them
better
the
more
i
know
of
them
a
great
deal
of
quiet
liberality
even
extreme
liberality
in
the
two
girls
they
would
suit
you
i
am
sure
well
instructed
agnes
the
younger
reads
half
a
dozen
languages
and
shames
me
by
her
knowledge
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
yet
delightfully
feminine
they
were
going
to
ostend
i
thought
i
might
as
well
follow
them
and
we
continue
to
see
each
other
pretty
frequently
i
shall
have
to
find
new
quarters
if
i
come
back
to
london
the
engineer
back
from
italy
after
a
longer
absence
than
he
anticipated
wants
his
flat
and
of
course
must
have
it
but
then
i
may
not
come
back
at
all
except
to
gather
my
traps
i
shall
not
call
on
you
unless
i
have
heard
that
you
do
doubt
the
assurance
i
have
now
twice
your
profligate
relative
e
b
think
wrote
mary
we
may
safely
believe
him
such
a
lie
would
be
too
bad
he
is
incapable
of
it
remember
i
have
never
charged
him
with
falsehood
i
shall
write
and
tell
him
that
i
accept
his
word
has
it
or
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
to
see
widdowson
herself
or
if
there
are
insuperable
objections
why
not
see
miss
madden
we
talk
to
each
other
in
a
sort
of
cypher
dear
rhoda
well
i
desire
nothing
but
your
good
as
i
think
you
know
and
you
must
decide
for
yourself
where
that
good
lies
everard
letter
put
rhoda
beside
herself
with
wrath
in
writing
it
he
knew
it
would
come
into
her
hands
he
hoped
to
sting
her
with
jealousy
so
widdowson
had
done
him
a
service
he
was
free
to
devote
himself
to
agnes
brissenden
with
her
six
languages
her
extreme
liberality
her
feminine
charm
if
she
could
not
crush
out
her
love
for
this
man
she
would
poison
herself
as
she
had
so
often
decided
she
would
do
if
ever
some
hopeless
malady
such
as
cancer
took
hold
upon
her
and
be
content
to
feed
his
vanity
to
give
him
the
lifelong
reflection
that
for
love
of
him
a
woman
excelled
by
few
in
qualities
of
brain
and
heart
had
died
like
a
rat
she
walked
about
the
rooms
here
and
there
upstairs
and
downstairs
in
a
fever
of
unrest
after
all
was
he
not
behaving
in
the
very
way
she
ought
to
desire
was
he
not
helping
her
to
hate
him
he
struck
at
her
with
unmanly
blows
thinking
no
doubt
to
quell
her
pride
and
bring
her
to
him
in
prostrate
humility
never
even
if
it
were
proved
in
the
clearest
way
that
she
ought
to
have
believed
him
she
would
make
no
submission
if
he
loved
her
he
must
woo
once
more
but
the
suggestion
in
mary
letter
was
not
fruitless
when
she
had
thought
over
it
for
a
day
or
two
she
wrote
to
virginia
madden
asking
her
as
a
favour
to
come
to
queen
road
on
saturday
afternoon
virginia
quickly
replied
with
a
promise
to
call
and
punctually
kept
the
engagement
though
she
was
much
better
dressed
than
in
the
days
previous
to
monica
marriage
she
had
lost
something
for
which
costume
could
not
compensate
her
face
had
no
longer
that
unmistakable
refinement
which
had
been
wont
to
make
her
attire
a
secondary
consideration
a
disagreeable
redness
tinged
her
eyelids
and
the
lower
part
of
her
nose
her
mouth
was
growing
coarse
and
lax
the
hanging
a
little
she
smiled
with
a
shrinking
apologetic
shyness
only
seen
in
people
who
have
done
something
to
be
ashamed
of
smiled
even
when
she
was
endeavouring
to
look
sorrowful
and
her
glance
was
furtive
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
like
an
anxious
applicant
for
work
or
charity
and
a
moistness
of
the
eyes
which
obliged
her
to
use
her
handkerchief
frequently
strengthened
this
resemblance
rhoda
could
not
play
at
smooth
phrases
with
this
poor
dispirited
woman
whose
change
during
the
last
few
years
and
especially
during
the
last
twelve
months
had
often
occupied
her
thoughts
in
a
very
unpleasant
way
she
came
almost
at
once
to
the
subject
of
their
interview
have
you
not
been
to
see
me
before
this
really
could
the
circumstances
everything
is
so
very
painful
you
know
of
course
you
know
what
has
happened
course
i
do
asked
virginia
timidly
the
news
first
of
all
reach
you
widdowson
came
here
and
told
miss
barfoot
everything
came
we
did
know
that
then
you
have
heard
the
accusation
he
makes
is
quite
unfounded
i
do
assure
you
monica
is
not
guilty
the
poor
child
has
done
nothing
it
was
an
indiscretion
nothing
more
than
indiscretion
am
very
anxious
to
believe
it
can
you
give
me
certainty
can
you
explain
monica
behaviour
not
only
on
that
one
occasion
but
the
deceit
she
practised
at
other
times
her
husband
told
miss
barfoot
that
she
had
frequently
told
him
untruths
such
as
saying
that
she
called
here
when
she
certainly
did
not
ca
explain
that
lamented
virginia
wo
tell
me
why
she
concealed
her
movements
how
can
you
ask
me
to
believe
your
assurance
that
she
guilty
the
sternness
of
this
question
caused
virginia
to
redden
and
become
utterly
disconcerted
she
dropped
her
handkerchief
fumbled
for
it
breathed
hard
miss
nunn
how
can
you
think
monica
you
know
her
better
sure
you
do
human
being
may
commit
a
crime
said
the
other
impatiently
exasperated
by
what
seemed
to
be
merely
new
evidence
against
barfoot
knows
any
one
well
enough
to
say
that
a
charge
be
unfounded
miss
madden
began
to
sob
afraid
that
is
true
but
my
sister
my
dear
sister
did
want
to
distress
you
do
command
yourself
and
let
us
talk
about
it
calmly
i
will
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
talk
about
it
with
you
oh
if
i
could
persuade
her
to
return
to
her
husband
he
is
willing
to
receive
her
i
meet
him
very
often
on
clapham
common
and
we
are
living
at
his
expense
when
monica
had
been
with
me
in
my
old
lodgings
for
about
a
week
he
took
these
new
rooms
for
us
and
monica
consented
to
remove
but
she
wo
hear
of
going
back
to
live
with
him
he
has
offered
to
let
us
have
the
house
to
ourselves
but
it
no
use
he
writes
to
her
but
she
wo
reply
do
you
know
that
he
has
taken
a
house
at
clevedon
a
beautiful
house
they
were
to
go
to
it
in
a
week
or
two
and
alice
and
i
would
have
gone
to
share
it
with
them
then
this
dreadful
thing
happened
and
widdowson
does
even
insist
on
her
telling
him
what
she
keeps
secret
he
is
willing
to
take
her
back
under
any
circumstances
and
she
is
so
ill
virginia
broke
off
as
if
there
were
something
more
that
she
did
not
venture
to
impart
her
cheeks
coloured
and
she
looked
distressfully
about
the
room
ill
do
you
mean
inquired
rhoda
with
difficulty
softening
her
voice
gets
up
each
day
but
i
often
afraid
that
she
has
had
fainting
fits
rhoda
gazed
at
the
speaker
with
pitiless
scrutiny
can
have
caused
this
is
it
the
result
of
her
being
falsely
accused
that
but
suddenly
virginia
rose
stepped
to
rhoda
side
and
whispered
a
word
or
two
rhoda
turned
pale
her
eyes
glared
fiercely
you
believe
her
innocent
has
sworn
to
me
that
she
is
innocent
she
says
that
she
has
a
proof
of
it
which
i
shall
see
some
day
and
her
husband
also
a
presentiment
has
fixed
itself
in
her
mind
that
she
ca
live
and
before
the
end
she
will
tell
everything
husband
knows
of
this
of
course
of
what
you
have
told
me
she
has
forbidden
me
to
say
anything
and
how
could
i
miss
nunn
she
has
made
me
promise
solemnly
that
he
shall
not
be
told
i
even
told
alice
but
she
will
know
very
soon
at
the
end
of
september
she
leaves
her
place
and
will
come
to
london
to
be
with
us
for
a
time
at
all
events
we
do
so
hope
that
we
shall
succeed
in
persuading
monica
to
go
to
the
house
at
clevedon
widdowson
is
keeping
it
and
will
move
the
furniture
from
herne
hill
at
any
moment
could
you
help
us
dear
miss
nunn
monica
would
listen
to
you
i
am
sure
she
would
afraid
i
can
be
of
no
use
rhoda
answered
coldly
has
been
hoping
to
see
you
has
said
so
in
so
many
words
but
i
am
sure
she
wishes
to
see
you
she
has
asked
about
you
several
times
and
when
your
note
came
she
was
very
pleased
it
would
be
a
great
kindness
to
us
she
declare
that
she
will
never
return
to
her
husband
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
does
but
the
poor
child
believes
that
she
has
only
a
short
time
to
live
nothing
will
shake
her
presentiment
i
shall
die
and
give
no
more
trouble
that
what
she
always
says
to
me
and
a
conviction
of
that
kind
is
so
likely
to
fulfil
itself
she
never
leaves
the
house
and
of
course
that
is
very
wrong
she
ought
to
go
out
every
day
she
wo
see
a
medical
man
widdowson
given
her
any
cause
for
disliking
him
rhoda
inquired
was
dreadfully
violent
when
he
discovered
i
afraid
it
was
natural
he
thought
the
worst
of
her
and
he
has
always
been
so
devoted
to
monica
she
says
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
killing
her
he
is
a
man
of
very
severe
nature
i
have
always
thought
he
never
could
bear
that
monica
should
go
anywhere
alone
they
were
very
very
unhappy
afraid
so
in
almost
every
respect
still
under
the
circumstances
surely
she
ought
to
return
to
him
ca
say
i
do
know
rhoda
voice
signified
a
conflict
of
feeling
had
she
been
disinterested
her
opinion
would
not
have
wavered
for
a
moment
she
would
have
declared
that
the
wife
inclination
must
be
the
only
law
in
such
a
case
as
it
was
she
could
only
regard
monica
with
profound
mistrust
and
repugnance
the
story
of
decisive
evidence
kept
back
seemed
to
her
only
a
weak
woman
falsehood
a
fiction
due
to
shame
and
despair
undoubtedly
it
would
give
some
vague
relief
to
her
mind
if
monica
were
persuaded
to
go
to
clevedon
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
think
of
visiting
the
suffering
woman
whatever
the
end
might
be
she
would
have
no
part
in
bringing
it
about
her
dignity
her
pride
should
remain
unsullied
by
such
hateful
contact
must
stay
longer
said
virginia
rising
after
a
painful
silence
am
always
afraid
to
be
away
from
her
even
for
an
hour
the
fear
of
dreadful
things
that
might
happen
haunts
me
day
and
night
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
alice
comes
rhoda
had
no
words
of
sympathy
her
commiseration
for
virginia
was
only
such
as
she
might
have
felt
for
any
stranger
involved
in
sordid
troubles
all
the
old
friendliness
had
vanished
nor
would
she
have
been
greatly
shocked
or
astonished
had
she
followed
miss
madden
on
the
way
to
the
railway
station
and
seen
her
after
a
glance
up
and
down
the
street
turn
quickly
into
a
and
come
forth
again
holding
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
a
feeble
purposeless
hopeless
woman
type
of
a
whole
class
living
only
to
deteriorate
will
purpose
was
not
in
danger
of
forgetting
these
watchwords
which
had
guided
her
life
out
of
youth
into
maturity
that
poor
creature
unhappiness
was
doubtless
in
great
measure
due
to
the
conviction
that
in
missing
love
and
marriage
she
had
missed
everything
so
thought
the
average
woman
and
in
her
darkest
hours
she
too
had
fallen
among
those
poor
of
spirit
the
flesh
prevailing
but
the
soul
in
her
had
not
finally
succumbed
passion
had
a
new
significance
her
conception
of
life
was
larger
more
liberal
she
made
no
vows
to
crush
the
natural
instincts
but
her
conscience
her
sincerity
should
not
suffer
wherever
destiny
might
lead
she
would
still
be
the
same
proud
and
independent
woman
responsible
only
to
herself
fulfilling
the
nobler
laws
of
her
existence
a
day
or
two
after
this
she
had
guests
to
dine
with
her
mildred
vesper
and
winifred
haven
among
the
girls
whom
she
had
helped
to
educate
these
two
seemed
by
far
the
most
the
most
courageous
and
hopeful
in
minor
details
of
character
they
differed
widely
and
intellectually
miss
haven
was
far
in
advance
rhoda
had
a
strong
desire
to
observe
them
as
they
talked
about
the
most
various
subjects
she
knew
them
well
but
hoped
to
find
in
them
some
new
suggestion
of
womanly
force
which
would
be
of
help
to
her
in
her
own
struggle
for
redemption
it
was
seldom
that
either
of
them
ailed
anything
mildred
still
showed
traces
of
her
country
breeding
she
was
the
more
robust
walked
with
a
heavier
step
had
less
polish
of
manner
under
strain
of
any
kind
winifred
health
would
sooner
give
way
but
her
natural
vivacity
promised
long
resistance
to
oppressing
influences
mildred
had
worked
harder
and
amid
privations
of
which
the
other
girl
knew
nothing
she
would
never
distinguish
herself
but
it
was
difficult
indeed
to
imagine
her
repining
so
long
as
she
had
her
strength
and
her
congenial
friends
twenty
years
hence
in
all
probability
she
would
keep
the
same
clear
steady
eye
the
same
honest
smile
and
the
same
dry
humour
in
her
talk
winifred
was
more
likely
to
traverse
a
latitude
of
storm
for
one
thing
her
social
position
brought
her
in
the
way
of
men
who
might
fall
in
love
with
her
whereas
mildred
lived
absolutely
apart
from
the
male
world
doubtless
too
her
passions
were
stronger
she
loved
literature
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
in
study
and
had
set
her
mind
upon
helping
to
establish
that
ideal
woman
paper
of
which
there
was
often
talk
at
miss
barfoot
in
this
company
rhoda
felt
her
old
ambitions
regaining
their
power
over
her
to
these
girls
she
was
an
exemplar
it
made
her
smile
to
think
how
little
they
could
dream
of
what
she
had
experienced
during
the
last
few
weeks
if
ever
a
moment
of
discontent
assailed
them
they
must
naturally
think
of
her
of
the
brave
encouraging
words
she
had
so
often
spoken
for
a
moment
she
had
deserted
them
abandoning
a
course
which
her
reason
steadily
approved
for
one
that
was
beset
with
perils
of
indignity
it
would
shame
her
if
they
knew
the
whole
truth
and
yet
she
wished
it
were
possible
for
them
to
learn
that
she
had
been
passionately
wooed
a
contemptible
impulse
of
vanity
away
with
it
there
was
a
chance
it
seemed
to
her
that
during
miss
absence
everard
might
come
to
the
house
mary
had
written
to
him
he
would
know
that
she
was
away
what
better
opportunity
if
he
had
not
dismissed
her
memory
from
his
thoughts
every
evening
she
made
herself
ready
to
receive
a
possible
visitor
she
took
thought
for
her
appearance
but
the
weeks
passed
by
miss
barfoot
returned
and
everard
had
given
no
sign
she
would
set
a
date
a
limit
if
before
christmas
he
neither
came
nor
wrote
all
was
at
an
end
after
that
she
would
not
see
him
whatever
his
plea
and
having
persuaded
herself
that
this
decision
was
irrevocable
she
thought
it
as
well
to
gratify
miss
barfoot
curiosity
for
by
now
she
felt
able
to
relate
what
had
happened
in
cumberland
with
a
certain
satisfaction
the
feeling
she
had
foreseen
when
in
the
beginning
of
her
acquaintance
with
everard
it
flattered
her
to
observe
his
growing
interest
her
narrative
to
which
mary
listened
with
downcast
eyes
presented
the
outlines
of
the
story
veraciously
she
told
of
wish
to
dispense
with
the
legal
bond
of
her
own
indecision
and
of
the
issue
your
letter
came
could
i
very
well
have
acted
otherwise
than
i
did
it
was
not
a
flat
refusal
to
believe
him
all
i
asked
was
that
things
should
be
cleared
up
before
our
marriage
for
his
own
sake
he
ought
to
have
willingly
agreed
to
that
he
preferred
to
take
my
request
as
an
insult
his
unreasonable
anger
made
me
angry
too
and
now
i
think
we
shall
ever
meet
again
unless
as
mere
acquaintances
think
commented
the
listener
he
behaved
with
extraordinary
impudence
the
first
proposal
but
i
myself
attach
no
importance
to
the
marriage
ceremony
why
did
you
insist
upon
it
asked
mary
with
a
smile
that
might
have
become
sarcastic
but
that
her
eye
met
rhoda
you
have
received
us
the
one
case
as
readily
as
in
the
other
rhoda
was
silent
and
darkly
thoughtful
i
never
felt
entire
confidence
in
him
mary
smiled
and
sighed
chapter
xxviii
the
burden
of
futile
souls
own
dearest
love
if
i
could
but
describe
to
you
all
i
have
suffered
before
sitting
down
to
write
this
letter
since
our
last
meeting
i
have
not
known
one
hour
of
quietness
to
think
that
i
missed
you
when
you
called
and
left
that
note
for
it
was
you
yourself
was
it
not
the
journey
was
horrible
and
the
week
that
i
have
spent
here
i
assure
you
i
have
not
slept
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
i
am
utterly
broken
down
by
misery
my
darling
etc
regard
myself
as
a
criminal
if
have
suffered
a
thousandth
part
of
what
have
i
deserve
any
punishment
that
could
be
devised
for
it
has
all
been
my
fault
knowing
as
i
did
that
our
love
could
never
end
in
happiness
it
was
my
duty
to
hide
what
i
felt
i
ought
never
to
have
contrived
that
first
meeting
alone
for
it
contrived
i
sent
my
sisters
away
on
purpose
i
ought
never
etc
only
reflection
that
can
ever
bring
me
comfort
is
that
our
love
has
been
pure
we
can
always
think
of
each
other
without
shame
and
why
should
this
love
ever
have
an
end
we
are
separated
and
perhaps
shall
never
see
each
other
again
but
may
not
our
hearts
remain
for
ever
true
may
we
not
think
etc
i
were
to
bid
you
leave
your
home
and
come
to
me
i
should
be
once
more
acting
with
base
selfishness
i
should
ruin
your
life
and
load
my
own
with
endless
i
find
that
even
mere
outward
circumstances
would
not
allow
of
what
for
a
moment
we
dreamt
might
be
possible
and
of
that
i
am
since
it
helps
me
to
overcome
the
terrible
temptation
oh
if
you
knew
how
that
temptation
etc
will
be
a
friend
to
both
of
us
dearest
monica
forget
each
other
we
never
can
we
will
but
our
unsullied
love
etc
monica
read
it
through
again
the
long
rigmarole
since
the
day
that
she
received
it
addressed
to
williamson
at
the
little
stationer
by
lavender
hill
the
day
before
she
consented
to
accompany
her
sister
into
new
lodgings
the
letter
had
lain
in
its
alone
this
afternoon
for
virginia
was
gone
to
call
on
miss
nunn
alone
and
miserable
every
printed
page
a
weariness
to
her
sight
she
took
out
the
envelope
and
tried
to
think
that
its
contents
interested
her
but
not
a
word
had
power
of
attraction
or
of
repulsion
the
tender
phrases
affected
her
no
more
than
if
they
had
been
addressed
to
a
stranger
love
was
become
a
meaningless
word
she
could
not
understand
how
she
had
ever
drifted
into
such
relations
with
the
writer
fear
and
anger
were
the
sole
passions
surviving
in
her
memory
from
those
days
which
had
violently
transformed
her
life
and
it
was
not
with
bevis
but
her
husband
that
these
emotions
were
connected
bevis
image
stood
in
that
already
distant
past
like
a
lay
figure
the
mere
semblance
of
a
man
and
with
such
conception
of
him
his
letter
corresponded
it
was
artificial
lifeless
as
if
extracted
from
some
vapid
novel
but
she
must
not
destroy
it
its
use
was
still
to
come
letter
and
envelope
must
go
back
again
into
hiding
and
await
the
day
which
would
give
them
power
over
human
lives
suffering
as
always
from
headache
and
lassitude
she
sat
by
the
window
and
watched
the
people
who
passed
along
her
daily
occupation
this
was
on
the
ground
floor
in
a
room
above
some
one
was
receiving
a
music
lesson
every
now
and
then
the
teacher
voice
became
audible
raised
in
sharp
impatience
and
generally
accompanied
by
a
clash
upon
the
keys
of
the
piano
at
the
area
gate
of
the
house
opposite
a
servant
was
talking
angrily
with
a
tradesman
errand
boy
who
at
length
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
with
insulting
significance
and
scampered
off
then
at
the
house
next
to
that
one
there
stopped
a
cab
from
which
three
men
alighted
cabs
full
of
people
were
always
stopping
at
that
door
monica
wondered
what
it
meant
who
might
live
there
she
thought
of
asking
the
landlady
virginia
return
aroused
her
she
went
upstairs
with
her
sister
into
the
room
which
they
occupied
have
you
heard
went
there
he
told
them
everything
did
miss
nunn
look
how
did
she
speak
she
was
very
very
distant
lamented
virginia
do
quite
know
why
she
sent
for
me
she
said
there
would
be
no
use
in
her
coming
to
see
you
and
i
do
think
she
ever
will
i
told
her
that
there
was
no
truth
in
how
did
she
look
asked
monica
impatiently
at
all
well
i
thought
she
had
been
away
for
her
holiday
but
it
does
seem
to
have
done
her
much
good
went
there
and
told
them
everything
just
after
it
happened
but
he
has
seen
them
since
that
i
could
see
they
believed
him
it
was
no
use
all
that
i
said
she
looked
so
stern
and
you
ask
anything
about
mr
barfoot
dear
i
did
venture
to
it
was
impossible
but
i
feel
quite
sure
that
they
must
have
broken
off
all
intercourse
with
him
whatever
he
may
have
said
they
evidently
did
believe
it
miss
barfoot
is
away
now
what
did
you
tell
her
about
me
that
you
said
i
might
dear
else
you
are
sure
virginia
coloured
but
made
asseveration
that
nothing
else
had
passed
her
lips
would
have
mattered
if
you
had
said
monica
indifferently
do
care
the
sister
struggling
with
shame
was
irritated
by
the
needlessness
of
her
falsehood
why
were
you
so
particular
to
forbid
me
monica
was
better
but
i
do
care
i
do
care
for
anything
let
them
believe
and
say
what
they
like
if
i
find
out
at
last
that
you
have
deceived
me
do
do
do
be
quiet
cried
the
other
wretchedly
shall
go
somewhere
and
live
alone
or
die
alone
you
worry
me
i
tired
of
it
are
not
very
grateful
monica
ca
be
grateful
you
must
expect
nothing
from
me
if
you
keep
talking
and
questioning
i
shall
go
away
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
the
sooner
i
die
the
better
scenes
such
as
this
had
been
frequent
lately
the
sisters
were
a
great
trial
to
each
other
nerves
tedium
and
pain
drove
monica
to
the
relief
of
altercation
and
virginia
through
her
secret
vice
was
losing
all
they
wrangled
wailed
talked
of
parting
and
only
became
quiet
when
their
emotions
had
exhausted
them
yet
no
resulted
from
these
disputes
virginia
had
a
rooted
faith
in
her
sister
innocence
when
angry
she
only
tried
to
provoke
monica
into
a
full
explanation
of
the
mystery
so
insoluble
by
unaided
conjecture
and
monica
say
what
she
might
repaid
this
confidence
with
profound
gratitude
strangely
she
had
come
to
view
herself
as
not
only
innocent
of
the
specific
charge
brought
against
her
but
as
a
woman
in
every
sense
maligned
so
utterly
void
of
significance
from
her
present
point
of
view
was
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
bevis
one
reason
for
this
lay
in
the
circumstance
that
when
exchanging
declarations
with
her
lover
she
was
ignorant
of
a
fact
which
had
she
known
it
would
have
made
their
meetings
impossible
her
husband
she
could
never
regard
but
as
a
cruel
enemy
none
the
less
nature
had
set
a
seal
upon
their
marriage
against
which
the
revolt
of
her
heart
was
powerless
if
she
lived
to
bear
a
child
that
child
would
be
his
widdowson
when
he
heard
of
her
condition
would
declare
it
the
final
proof
of
infidelity
and
this
injustice
it
was
that
exclusively
occupied
her
mind
on
this
account
she
could
think
only
of
the
accusation
which
connected
her
name
with
barfoot
all
else
was
triviality
had
there
been
no
slightest
ground
for
imputation
upon
her
conduct
she
could
not
have
resented
more
vigorously
her
refusal
to
acquit
her
of
dishonour
on
the
following
day
after
their
early
dinner
monica
unexpectedly
declared
that
she
must
go
out
with
me
we
go
into
the
town
you
refused
to
go
out
this
morning
when
it
was
fine
complained
virginia
now
you
can
see
it
will
rain
i
shall
go
alone
the
sister
at
once
started
up
no
i
quite
ready
where
do
you
wish
out
of
this
dead
place
we
go
by
train
and
walk
from
victoria
anywhere
to
the
abbey
if
you
like
must
be
very
careful
not
to
catch
cold
after
all
this
time
that
you
have
left
the
house
monica
cut
short
the
admonition
and
dressed
herself
with
feverish
impatience
as
they
set
forth
drops
of
rain
had
begun
to
fall
but
monica
would
not
hear
of
waiting
the
journey
by
train
made
her
nervous
but
affected
her
spirits
favourably
at
victoria
it
rained
so
heavily
that
they
could
not
go
out
into
the
street
does
matter
there
plenty
to
see
here
let
us
walk
about
and
look
at
things
we
buy
something
at
the
bookstall
to
take
back
as
they
turned
again
towards
the
platform
monica
was
confronted
by
a
face
which
she
at
once
recognized
though
it
had
changed
noticeably
in
the
eighteen
months
since
she
last
saw
it
the
person
was
miss
eade
her
old
acquaintance
at
the
shop
but
the
girl
no
longer
dressed
as
in
those
days
cheap
finery
of
the
description
arrayed
her
form
and
it
needed
little
scrutiny
to
perceive
that
her
thin
cheeks
were
artificially
reddened
the
surprise
of
the
meeting
was
not
only
reason
for
evincing
embarrassment
seeing
that
miss
eade
was
uncertain
whether
to
make
a
sign
of
acquaintance
she
felt
it
would
be
wiser
to
go
by
but
this
was
not
permitted
as
they
were
passing
each
other
the
girl
bent
her
head
and
whispered
want
to
speak
to
you
just
a
minute
virginia
perceived
the
communication
and
looked
in
surprise
at
her
sister
one
of
the
girls
from
walworth
road
said
monica
walk
on
i
meet
you
at
the
bookstall
my
dear
she
does
look
respectable
on
i
wo
be
a
minute
monica
motioned
to
miss
eade
who
followed
her
towards
a
more
retired
spot
have
left
the
shop
i
should
think
so
nearly
a
year
ago
i
told
you
i
stand
it
much
longer
are
you
married
monica
did
not
understand
why
the
girl
should
eye
her
so
suspiciously
are
said
miss
eade
that
i
know
i
suppose
a
stranger
to
you
the
other
made
an
unpleasant
click
with
her
tongue
and
looked
vaguely
about
her
then
she
remarked
inconsequently
that
she
was
waiting
the
arrival
of
her
brother
by
train
a
traveller
for
a
shop
makes
five
hundred
a
year
i
keep
house
for
him
because
of
course
he
a
widower
the
course
puzzled
monica
for
a
moment
but
she
remembered
that
it
was
an
unmeaning
expletive
much
used
by
people
of
miss
education
however
the
story
did
not
win
her
credence
by
this
time
her
disagreeable
surmises
had
too
much
support
there
anything
you
wished
particularly
to
speak
about
have
seen
nothing
of
mr
bullivant
to
what
a
remote
period
of
her
life
this
name
seemed
to
recall
monica
she
glanced
quickly
at
the
speaker
and
again
detected
suspicion
in
her
eyes
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
him
since
i
left
walworth
road
he
still
there
he
he
went
about
the
same
time
you
did
and
nobody
knew
where
he
hid
himself
why
should
he
hide
only
mean
he
got
out
of
sight
somewheres
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
come
across
him
i
have
now
i
must
say
that
lady
is
waiting
for
me
miss
eade
nodded
but
immediately
altered
her
mind
and
checked
monica
as
she
was
turning
away
would
mind
telling
me
what
your
married
name
may
be
really
does
concern
you
miss
eade
replied
the
other
stiffly
must
go
you
do
tell
me
i
follow
you
till
i
find
out
and
chance
it
the
change
from
tolerable
civility
to
coarse
insolence
was
so
sudden
that
monica
stood
in
astonishment
there
was
unconcealed
malignity
in
the
gaze
fixed
upon
her
do
you
mean
what
interest
have
you
in
learning
my
name
the
girl
brought
her
face
near
and
snarled
in
the
true
voice
of
the
pavement
it
a
name
as
you
ashamed
to
let
out
monica
walked
away
to
the
bookstall
when
she
had
joined
her
sister
she
became
aware
that
miss
eade
was
keeping
her
in
sight
us
buy
a
book
she
said
go
home
again
the
rain
wo
stop
they
selected
a
cheap
volume
and
having
their
return
tickets
moved
towards
the
departure
platform
before
she
could
reach
the
gates
monica
heard
miss
eade
voice
just
behind
her
it
had
changed
again
and
the
appealing
note
reminded
her
of
many
conversations
in
walworth
road
tell
me
i
beg
your
pardon
for
bein
rude
do
go
without
telling
me
the
meaning
of
this
importunity
had
already
flashed
upon
monica
and
now
she
felt
a
slight
pity
for
the
tawdry
abandoned
creature
in
whom
there
seemed
to
survive
that
hopeless
passion
of
old
days
name
she
said
abruptly
mrs
widdowson
you
telling
me
the
truth
have
told
you
what
you
wish
to
know
i
ca
talk
you
do
really
know
nothing
about
whatever
miss
eade
moved
sullenly
away
not
more
than
half
convinced
long
after
monica
disappearance
she
strayed
about
the
platform
and
the
approaches
to
the
station
her
brother
was
slow
in
arriving
once
or
twice
she
held
casual
colloquy
with
men
who
also
stood
waiting
perchance
for
their
sisters
and
ultimately
one
of
these
was
kind
enough
to
offer
her
refreshment
which
she
graciously
accepted
rhoda
nunn
would
have
classed
her
and
mused
about
her
a
not
unimportant
type
of
the
odd
woman
after
this
monica
frequently
went
out
always
accompanied
by
her
sister
it
happened
more
than
once
that
they
saw
widdowson
who
walked
past
the
house
at
least
every
other
day
he
did
approach
them
and
had
he
done
so
monica
would
have
kept
an
obstinate
silence
for
more
than
a
fortnight
he
had
not
written
to
her
at
length
there
came
a
letter
merely
a
repetition
of
his
former
appeals
hear
he
wrote
your
elder
sister
is
coming
to
london
why
should
she
live
here
in
lodgings
when
a
comfortable
house
is
at
the
disposal
of
you
all
let
me
again
entreat
you
to
go
to
clevedon
the
furniture
shall
be
moved
any
moment
you
wish
i
solemnly
promise
not
to
molest
you
in
any
way
not
even
by
writing
it
shall
be
understood
that
business
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
live
in
london
for
your
sake
do
accept
this
offer
if
i
could
see
you
in
private
i
should
be
able
to
give
you
a
very
good
reason
why
your
sister
virginia
would
benefit
by
the
change
perhaps
you
yourself
know
of
it
do
answer
me
monica
never
again
will
i
refer
by
word
or
look
to
what
has
passed
i
am
anxious
only
to
put
an
end
to
the
wretched
life
that
you
are
leading
do
go
to
the
house
at
clevedon
i
implore
you
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
hinted
darkly
at
a
benefit
that
might
accrue
to
virginia
if
she
left
london
monica
had
no
inkling
of
what
he
meant
she
showed
her
sister
this
communication
and
asked
if
she
could
understand
the
passage
which
concerned
her
have
the
least
idea
virginia
replied
her
hand
trembling
as
she
held
the
paper
can
only
suppose
that
he
thinks
that
i
am
not
looking
well
the
letter
was
burnt
as
all
the
others
had
been
no
answer
vouchsafed
virginia
mind
seemed
to
waver
with
regard
to
the
proposed
settlement
at
clevedon
occasionally
she
had
urged
monica
with
extreme
persistence
to
accept
what
was
offered
at
other
times
as
now
for
instance
she
said
nothing
yet
alice
had
written
beseeching
her
to
use
all
means
for
monica
persuasion
miss
madden
infinitely
preferred
the
thought
of
dwelling
at
clevedon
however
humble
the
circumstances
had
been
to
that
of
coming
back
into
london
lodgings
whilst
she
sought
for
a
new
engagement
the
situation
she
was
about
to
quit
had
proved
more
laborious
than
any
in
her
experience
at
first
merely
a
governess
she
had
gradually
become
children
nurse
as
well
and
for
the
past
three
months
had
been
expected
to
add
the
tendance
of
a
chronic
invalid
to
her
other
duties
not
a
day
holiday
since
she
came
she
was
broken
down
and
utterly
woebegone
but
monica
could
not
be
moved
she
refused
to
go
again
under
her
husband
roof
until
he
had
stated
that
his
charge
against
her
was
absolutely
unfounded
this
concession
went
beyond
widdowson
power
he
would
forgive
but
still
declined
to
stultify
himself
by
a
statement
that
could
have
no
meaning
to
what
extent
his
wife
had
deceived
him
might
be
uncertain
but
the
deception
was
a
proved
fact
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
monica
demand
had
a
significance
which
emphasized
the
name
of
barfoot
had
he
said
am
convinced
that
your
relations
with
barfoot
were
innocent
he
would
have
seemed
to
himself
to
be
acquitting
her
of
all
criminality
whereas
monica
from
her
point
of
view
illogically
supposed
that
he
might
credit
her
on
this
one
issue
without
overthrowing
all
the
evidence
that
declared
her
untrustworthy
in
short
she
expected
him
to
read
a
riddle
which
there
was
scarcely
a
possibility
of
his
understanding
alice
was
in
correspondence
with
the
gloomy
husband
she
promised
him
to
use
every
effort
to
gain
monica
confidence
perhaps
as
the
eldest
sister
she
might
succeed
where
virginia
had
failed
her
faith
in
monica
protestations
had
been
much
shaken
by
the
item
of
intelligence
which
virginia
secretly
communicated
she
thought
it
too
likely
that
her
unhappy
sister
saw
no
refuge
from
disgrace
but
in
stubborn
denial
of
guilt
and
in
the
undertaking
that
was
before
her
she
had
no
hope
save
through
the
influence
of
religion
with
her
a
much
stronger
force
than
with
either
of
the
others
her
arrival
was
expected
on
the
last
day
of
september
the
evening
before
monica
went
to
bed
soon
after
eight
for
a
day
or
two
she
had
suffered
greatly
and
at
length
had
allowed
a
doctor
to
be
called
whenever
her
sister
retired
very
early
virginia
also
went
to
her
own
bedroom
saying
that
she
preferred
to
sit
there
the
room
much
surpassed
in
comfort
that
which
she
had
occupied
at
conisbee
it
was
spacious
and
provided
with
a
couple
of
very
soft
armchairs
having
locked
her
door
virginia
made
certain
preparations
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
natural
repose
from
the
cupboard
she
brought
out
a
little
and
put
water
to
boil
then
from
a
more
private
repository
were
produced
a
bottle
of
gin
and
a
which
together
with
a
tumbler
and
spoon
found
a
place
on
a
little
table
drawn
up
within
reach
of
the
chair
where
she
was
going
to
sit
on
the
same
table
lay
a
novel
procured
this
afternoon
from
the
library
whilst
the
water
was
boiling
virginia
made
a
slight
change
of
dress
conducive
to
bodily
ease
finally
having
mixed
a
glass
of
gin
and
water
only
of
the
diluent
she
sat
down
with
one
of
her
frequent
sighs
and
began
to
enjoy
the
evening
the
last
the
very
last
of
such
enjoyment
so
she
assured
herself
alice
presence
in
the
house
would
render
impossible
what
she
had
hitherto
succeeded
in
disguising
from
monica
her
conscience
welcomed
the
restraint
which
was
coming
none
too
soon
for
her
will
could
no
longer
be
depended
upon
if
she
abstained
from
strong
liquors
for
three
or
four
days
it
was
now
a
great
triumph
yet
worthless
for
even
in
abstaining
she
knew
that
the
hour
of
indulgence
had
only
been
postponed
a
fit
of
unendurable
depression
soon
drove
her
to
the
only
resource
which
had
immediate
efficacy
the
relief
she
knew
was
another
downward
step
but
presently
she
would
find
courage
to
climb
back
again
up
to
the
sure
ground
save
for
her
trouble
on
account
the
temptation
would
already
have
been
conquered
and
now
alice
arrival
made
courage
a
mere
necessity
her
bottle
was
all
but
empty
she
would
finish
it
and
in
the
morning
as
her
custom
was
take
it
back
to
the
grocer
in
her
little
how
convenient
that
this
kind
of
thing
could
be
purchased
at
the
grocer
in
the
beginning
she
had
chiefly
made
use
of
railway
refreshment
rooms
only
on
rare
occasions
did
she
enter
a
and
always
with
the
bitterest
sense
of
degradation
to
sit
comfortably
at
home
the
bottle
beside
her
and
a
novel
on
her
lap
was
an
avoidance
of
the
worst
shame
attaching
to
this
vice
she
went
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
ah
the
morning
brought
its
punishment
but
she
incurred
no
risk
of
being
detected
brandy
had
first
of
all
been
her
drink
as
is
generally
the
case
with
women
of
the
educated
class
there
are
so
many
plausible
excuses
for
taking
a
drop
of
brandy
but
it
cost
too
much
whisky
she
had
tried
and
did
not
like
finally
she
had
recourse
to
gin
which
was
palatable
and
very
cheap
the
name
debased
by
such
foul
associations
still
confused
her
when
she
uttered
it
as
a
rule
she
wrote
it
down
in
a
list
of
groceries
which
she
handed
over
the
counter
she
drank
her
first
glass
quickly
a
consuming
thirst
was
upon
her
by
eight
the
second
was
gently
steaming
at
her
elbow
at
nine
she
had
mixed
the
third
it
must
last
a
long
time
for
the
bottle
was
now
empty
the
novel
entertained
her
but
she
often
let
her
thoughts
stray
from
it
she
reflected
with
exultation
that
indulgence
was
her
very
last
on
the
morrow
she
would
be
a
new
woman
alice
and
she
would
devote
themselves
to
their
poor
sister
and
never
rest
till
they
had
restored
her
to
a
life
of
dignity
this
was
a
worthy
a
noble
task
success
in
it
must
need
minister
to
her
own
peace
before
long
they
would
all
be
living
at
clevedon
a
life
of
ideal
contentment
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
think
of
the
school
but
she
would
exert
herself
for
the
moral
instruction
of
young
women
on
the
principles
inculcated
by
rhoda
nunn
the
page
before
her
was
no
longer
legible
the
book
dropped
from
her
lap
why
this
excited
her
laughter
she
could
not
understand
but
she
laughed
for
a
long
time
until
her
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
it
might
be
better
to
go
to
bed
what
was
the
hour
she
tried
vainly
to
read
her
watch
and
again
laughed
at
such
absurd
incapacity
then
surely
that
was
a
knock
at
her
door
yes
it
was
repeated
with
a
distinct
calling
of
her
name
she
endeavoured
to
stand
up
madden
it
was
the
landlady
voice
madden
are
you
in
bed
yet
virginia
succeeded
in
reaching
the
door
is
it
another
voice
spoke
is
i
virginia
i
have
come
this
evening
instead
of
please
let
me
come
in
you
ca
i
come
wait
downstairs
she
was
still
able
to
understand
the
situation
and
able
she
thought
to
speak
coherently
to
disguise
her
condition
the
things
on
the
table
must
be
put
out
of
sight
in
trying
to
do
this
she
upset
her
glass
and
knocked
the
empty
bottle
on
to
the
floor
but
in
a
few
minutes
bottle
glass
and
were
hidden
away
the
she
lost
sight
of
it
still
remained
in
its
former
place
then
she
opened
the
door
and
with
uncertain
step
went
out
into
the
passage
she
called
aloud
at
once
both
her
sisters
appeared
coming
out
of
monica
chamber
monica
had
partly
dressed
herself
have
you
come
virginia
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
her
own
ears
perfectly
natural
she
tottered
and
was
obliged
to
support
herself
against
the
wall
the
light
from
her
room
fell
full
upon
her
and
alice
who
had
stepped
forward
to
give
her
a
kiss
not
only
saw
but
smelt
that
something
very
strange
was
the
matter
the
odour
proceeding
from
the
bedroom
and
that
of
virginia
breath
left
small
doubt
as
to
the
cause
of
delay
in
giving
admittance
whilst
alice
stood
bewildered
monica
received
an
illumination
which
instantly
made
clear
to
her
many
things
in
virginia
daily
life
at
the
same
moment
she
understood
those
mysterious
hints
concerning
her
sister
in
widdowson
letters
into
the
room
she
said
abruptly
virgie
do
understand
why
has
alice
come
what
the
time
monica
took
hold
of
the
tottering
woman
arm
and
drew
her
out
of
the
passage
the
cold
air
had
produced
its
natural
effect
upon
virginia
who
now
with
difficulty
supported
herself
virgie
cried
the
eldest
sister
when
the
door
was
closed
is
the
matter
what
does
it
mean
already
she
had
been
shedding
tears
at
the
meeting
with
monica
and
now
distress
overcame
her
she
sobbed
and
lamented
have
you
been
doing
virgie
asked
monica
with
severity
i
feel
a
little
faint
surprise
did
expect
down
at
once
you
are
disgusting
look
alice
she
pointed
to
the
on
the
table
then
after
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
she
went
to
the
cupboard
and
threw
the
door
open
thought
so
look
alice
and
to
think
i
never
suspected
this
it
has
been
going
on
a
long
time
oh
a
long
time
she
was
doing
it
at
conisbee
before
i
was
married
i
remember
smelling
spirits
virginia
was
making
efforts
to
rise
are
you
talking
about
she
exclaimed
in
a
thick
voice
and
with
a
countenance
which
was
changing
from
dazed
astonishment
to
anger
only
when
i
feel
faint
do
you
suppose
i
drink
where
alice
was
alice
here
virgie
what
it
mean
how
you
to
bed
at
once
virginia
said
monica
ashamed
of
you
go
back
into
my
room
alice
and
i
get
her
to
bed
ultimately
this
was
done
with
no
slight
trouble
monica
persuaded
her
sister
to
undress
and
got
her
into
a
recumbent
position
virginia
all
the
time
protesting
that
she
had
perfect
command
of
her
faculties
that
she
needed
no
help
whatever
and
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
insults
directed
against
her
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
was
monica
last
word
uttered
contemptuously
she
extinguished
the
lamp
and
returned
to
her
own
room
where
alice
was
still
weeping
the
unexpected
arrival
had
already
been
explained
to
monica
sudden
necessity
for
housing
a
visitor
had
led
to
the
proposition
that
miss
madden
for
her
last
night
should
occupy
a
servant
bedroom
glad
to
get
away
alice
chose
the
alternative
of
leaving
the
house
at
once
it
had
been
arranged
that
she
should
share
virginia
room
but
this
did
not
seem
advisable
said
monica
must
talk
to
her
very
seriously
i
believe
she
has
been
drinking
like
that
night
after
night
it
explains
the
look
she
always
has
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
could
you
have
imagined
anything
so
disgraceful
but
alice
had
softened
towards
the
erring
woman
must
remember
what
her
life
has
been
dear
i
afraid
loneliness
is
very
often
a
cause
need
have
been
lonely
she
refused
to
come
and
live
at
herne
hill
and
now
of
course
i
understand
why
conisbee
must
have
known
about
it
and
it
was
her
duty
to
tell
me
widdowson
had
found
out
somehow
i
feel
sure
she
explained
the
reason
of
this
belief
know
what
it
all
points
to
said
miss
madden
drying
her
sallow
pimpled
cheeks
must
do
as
your
husband
wishes
dearest
we
must
go
to
clevedon
there
the
poor
girl
will
be
out
of
temptation
and
virgie
may
go
too
monica
my
dear
sister
it
is
your
duty
use
that
word
to
me
exclaimed
the
other
angrily
is
my
duty
it
can
be
no
woman
duty
to
live
with
a
man
she
hates
or
even
to
make
a
pretence
of
living
with
him
dearest
must
begin
this
alice
i
have
been
ill
all
day
and
now
my
head
is
aching
terribly
go
downstairs
and
eat
the
supper
they
have
laid
for
you
could
touch
a
morsel
sobbed
miss
madden
everything
is
too
dreadful
life
is
too
hard
monica
had
returned
to
bed
and
lay
there
with
her
face
half
hidden
against
the
pillow
you
do
want
any
supper
she
said
in
a
moment
go
and
tell
them
so
that
they
need
sit
up
for
you
alice
obeyed
when
she
came
up
again
her
sister
was
or
pretended
to
be
asleep
even
the
noise
made
by
bringing
luggage
into
the
room
did
not
cause
her
to
move
having
sat
in
despondency
for
a
while
miss
madden
opened
one
of
her
boxes
and
sought
in
it
for
the
bible
which
it
was
her
custom
to
make
use
of
every
night
she
read
in
the
book
for
about
half
an
hour
then
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
prayed
silently
this
was
refuge
from
the
barrenness
and
bitterness
of
life
chapter
xxix
confession
and
counsel
the
sisters
did
not
exchange
a
word
until
morning
but
both
of
them
lay
long
awake
monica
was
the
first
to
lose
consciousness
she
slept
for
about
an
hour
then
the
pains
of
a
horrid
dream
disturbed
her
and
again
she
took
up
the
burden
of
thought
such
waking
after
brief
broken
sleep
when
mind
and
body
are
beset
by
weariness
yet
can
not
rest
when
night
with
its
awful
hush
and
its
mysterious
movements
makes
a
strange
dread
habitation
for
the
spirit
such
waking
is
a
grim
trial
of
human
fortitude
the
blood
flows
sluggishly
yet
subject
to
sudden
tremors
that
chill
the
veins
and
for
an
instant
choke
the
heart
purpose
is
idle
the
will
impure
over
the
past
hangs
a
shadow
of
remorse
and
life
that
must
yet
be
lived
shows
lurid
a
steep
pathway
to
the
hopeless
grave
of
this
cup
monica
drank
deeply
a
fear
of
death
compassed
her
about
night
after
night
it
had
thus
haunted
her
in
the
daytime
she
could
think
of
death
with
resignation
as
a
refuge
from
miseries
of
which
she
saw
no
other
end
but
this
hour
of
silent
darkness
shook
her
with
terrors
reason
availed
nothing
its
exercise
seemed
criminal
the
old
faiths
never
abandoned
though
modified
by
the
breath
of
intellectual
freedom
that
had
just
touched
her
reasserted
all
their
power
she
saw
herself
as
a
wicked
woman
in
the
eye
of
truth
not
less
wicked
than
her
husband
declared
her
a
sinner
stubborn
in
impenitence
defending
herself
by
a
paltry
ambiguity
that
had
all
the
evil
of
a
direct
lie
her
soul
trembled
in
its
nakedness
what
redemption
could
there
be
for
her
what
path
of
spiritual
health
was
discoverable
she
could
not
command
herself
to
love
the
father
of
her
child
the
repugnance
with
which
she
regarded
him
seemed
to
her
a
sin
against
nature
yet
how
was
she
responsible
for
it
would
it
profit
her
to
make
confession
and
be
humbled
before
him
the
confession
must
some
day
be
made
if
only
for
her
child
sake
but
she
foresaw
in
it
no
relief
of
mind
of
all
human
beings
her
husband
was
the
one
least
fitted
to
console
and
strengthen
her
she
cared
nothing
for
his
pardon
from
his
love
she
shrank
but
if
there
were
some
one
to
whom
she
could
utter
her
thoughts
with
the
certainty
of
being
understood
her
sisters
had
not
the
sympathetic
intelligence
necessary
for
aiding
her
virginia
was
weaker
than
she
herself
and
alice
dealt
only
in
sorrowful
commonplaces
profitable
perhaps
to
her
own
heart
but
powerless
over
the
trouble
of
another
among
the
few
people
she
had
called
her
friends
there
was
one
strong
woman
strong
of
brain
and
capable
it
might
be
of
speaking
the
words
that
go
from
soul
to
soul
this
woman
she
had
deeply
offended
yet
owing
to
mere
mischance
whether
or
no
rhoda
nunn
had
lent
ear
to
barfoot
wooing
she
must
be
gravely
offended
she
had
given
proof
of
it
in
the
interview
reported
by
virginia
the
scandal
spread
abroad
by
widdowson
might
even
have
been
fatal
to
a
happiness
of
which
she
had
dreamt
to
rhoda
nunn
some
form
of
reparation
was
owing
and
might
not
an
avowal
of
the
whole
truth
elicit
from
her
counsel
of
gratitude
some
solace
some
guidance
amid
the
tremors
of
night
monica
felt
able
to
take
this
step
for
the
mere
chance
of
comfort
that
it
offered
but
when
day
came
the
resolution
had
vanished
shame
and
pride
again
compelled
her
to
silence
and
this
morning
she
had
new
troubles
to
think
about
virginia
was
keeping
her
room
would
admit
no
one
answered
every
whisper
of
appeal
with
brief
vague
words
that
signified
anything
or
nothing
the
others
breakfasted
in
gloom
that
harmonized
only
too
well
with
the
heavy
dripping
sky
visible
from
their
windows
only
at
midday
did
alice
succeed
in
obtaining
speech
with
her
remorseful
sister
they
were
closeted
together
for
more
than
an
hour
and
the
elder
woman
came
forth
at
last
with
red
eyes
must
leave
her
alone
today
she
said
to
monica
wo
take
any
meal
oh
the
wretched
state
she
is
in
if
only
i
could
have
known
of
this
before
it
been
going
on
for
very
long
began
soon
after
she
went
to
live
at
conisbee
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
poor
girl
poor
thing
whether
she
can
ever
break
herself
of
it
who
knows
she
says
that
she
will
take
the
pledge
of
total
abstinence
and
i
encouraged
her
to
do
so
it
may
be
some
use
do
you
think
i
do
know
i
have
no
faith
in
her
reforming
unless
she
goes
away
from
london
she
thinks
herself
that
only
a
new
life
in
a
new
place
will
give
her
the
strength
my
dear
at
conisbee
she
starved
herself
to
have
money
to
buy
spirits
she
went
without
any
food
but
dry
bread
day
after
day
course
that
made
it
worse
she
must
have
craved
for
support
course
and
your
husband
knows
about
it
he
came
once
when
she
was
in
that
state
when
you
were
away
monica
nodded
sullenly
her
eyes
averted
life
has
been
so
dreadfully
unhealthy
she
seems
to
have
become
all
her
old
interests
have
gone
she
reads
nothing
but
novels
day
after
day
have
noticed
that
can
we
help
her
monica
wo
you
make
a
sacrifice
for
the
poor
girl
sake
can
not
i
persuade
you
dear
your
position
has
a
bad
influence
on
her
i
can
see
it
has
she
worries
so
about
you
and
then
tries
to
forget
the
trouble
you
know
how
not
that
day
nor
the
next
could
monica
listen
to
these
entreaties
but
her
sister
at
length
prevailed
it
was
late
in
the
evening
virginia
had
gone
to
bed
and
the
others
sat
silently
without
occupation
miss
madden
after
several
vain
efforts
to
speak
bent
forward
and
said
in
a
low
grave
voice
you
are
deceiving
us
all
you
are
guilty
do
you
say
that
know
it
i
have
watched
you
you
betray
yourself
when
you
are
thinking
the
other
sat
with
brows
knitted
with
hard
defiant
lips
your
natural
affection
is
dead
and
only
guilt
could
have
caused
that
you
do
care
what
becomes
of
your
sister
only
the
fear
or
the
evil
pride
that
comes
of
guilt
could
make
you
refuse
what
we
ask
of
you
you
are
afraid
to
let
your
husband
know
of
your
condition
alice
could
not
have
spoken
thus
had
she
not
believed
what
she
said
the
conviction
had
become
irresistible
to
her
mind
her
voice
quivered
with
intensity
of
painful
emotion
last
is
true
said
her
sister
when
there
had
been
silence
for
a
minute
confess
it
o
monica
do
confess
what
you
think
went
on
the
younger
with
more
calmness
than
she
had
yet
commanded
in
these
discussions
that
i
am
guilty
i
am
afraid
of
his
knowing
because
he
will
never
believe
me
i
have
a
proof
which
would
convince
anyone
else
but
even
if
i
produced
it
it
would
be
no
use
i
do
think
it
is
possible
to
persuade
him
when
once
he
knows
you
were
innocent
you
would
disregard
that
to
me
alice
if
i
were
guilty
i
should
not
be
living
here
at
his
expense
i
only
consented
to
do
that
when
i
knew
what
my
condition
was
but
for
this
thing
i
should
have
refused
to
accept
another
penny
from
him
i
should
have
drawn
upon
my
own
money
until
i
was
able
to
earn
my
own
living
again
if
you
wo
believe
this
it
shows
you
know
nothing
of
me
your
reading
of
my
face
is
all
foolishness
would
to
god
i
were
sure
of
what
you
say
moaned
miss
madden
with
vehemence
which
seemed
extraordinary
in
such
a
feeble
flabby
person
know
that
i
told
my
husband
lies
exclaimed
monica
you
think
i
am
never
to
be
trusted
i
did
tell
him
lies
i
ca
deny
it
and
i
am
ashamed
of
it
but
i
am
not
a
deceitful
woman
i
can
say
that
boldly
i
love
the
truth
better
than
falsehood
if
it
were
for
that
i
should
never
have
left
home
a
deceitful
woman
in
my
circumstances
you
do
understand
them
would
have
cheated
her
husband
into
forgiving
her
such
a
husband
as
mine
she
would
have
calculated
the
most
profitable
course
i
left
my
husband
because
it
was
hateful
to
me
to
be
with
a
man
for
whom
i
had
lost
every
trace
of
affection
in
keeping
away
from
him
i
am
acting
honestly
but
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
also
afraid
of
his
making
a
discovery
i
want
him
to
believe
when
the
time
comes
she
broke
off
monica
you
ought
to
make
known
to
him
what
you
have
been
concealing
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
that
confession
ca
be
anything
very
dreadful
i
am
willing
to
make
an
agreement
if
my
husband
will
promise
never
to
come
near
clevedon
until
i
send
for
him
i
will
go
and
live
there
with
you
and
virgie
has
promised
that
darling
cried
miss
madden
delightedly
to
me
he
has
only
said
that
he
will
make
his
home
in
london
for
a
time
that
means
he
would
come
whenever
he
wished
if
it
were
only
to
speak
to
you
and
virgie
but
he
must
undertake
never
to
come
near
until
i
give
him
permission
if
he
will
promise
this
and
keep
his
word
i
pledge
myself
to
let
him
know
the
whole
truth
in
less
than
a
year
whether
i
live
or
die
he
shall
be
told
the
truth
in
less
than
a
year
before
going
to
bed
alice
wrote
and
dispatched
a
few
lines
to
widdowson
requesting
an
interview
with
him
as
soon
as
possible
she
would
come
to
his
house
at
any
hour
he
liked
to
appoint
the
next
afternoon
brought
a
reply
and
that
same
evening
miss
madden
went
to
herne
hill
as
a
result
of
what
passed
there
a
day
or
two
saw
the
beginning
of
the
removal
to
clevedon
widdowson
found
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
old
home
he
had
engaged
never
to
cross
the
bounds
of
somerset
until
he
received
his
wife
permission
as
soon
as
this
compact
was
established
monica
wrote
to
miss
nunn
a
short
submissive
letter
am
about
to
leave
london
and
before
i
go
i
very
much
wish
to
see
you
will
you
allow
me
to
call
at
some
hour
when
i
could
speak
to
you
in
private
there
is
something
i
must
make
known
to
you
and
i
can
not
write
it
after
a
day
interval
came
the
reply
which
was
still
briefer
miss
nunn
would
be
at
home
at
eight
this
or
the
next
evening
monica
announcement
that
she
must
go
out
alone
after
nightfall
alarmed
her
sisters
when
told
that
her
visit
was
to
rhoda
nunn
they
were
somewhat
relieved
but
alice
begged
to
be
permitted
to
accompany
her
will
be
lost
trouble
monica
declared
likely
than
not
there
is
a
spy
waiting
to
follow
me
wherever
i
go
your
assurance
that
i
really
went
to
miss
barfoot
wo
be
needed
when
the
others
still
opposed
her
purpose
she
passed
from
irony
into
anger
you
undertaken
to
save
him
the
expense
of
private
detectives
have
you
promised
never
to
let
me
go
out
of
your
sight
i
have
not
said
alice
i
dear
protested
virginia
has
never
asked
anything
of
the
kind
you
may
be
sure
that
the
spies
are
still
watching
me
let
them
have
something
to
do
poor
creatures
i
shall
go
alone
so
you
say
any
more
she
took
train
to
york
road
station
and
thence
as
the
night
was
fine
walked
to
chelsea
this
semblance
of
freedom
together
with
the
sense
of
having
taken
a
courageous
resolve
raised
her
spirits
she
hoped
that
a
detective
might
be
tracking
her
the
futility
of
such
measures
afforded
her
a
contemptuous
satisfaction
not
to
arrive
before
the
appointed
hour
she
loitered
on
chelsea
embankment
and
it
gave
her
pleasure
to
reflect
that
in
doing
this
she
was
outraging
the
proprieties
her
mind
was
in
a
strange
tumult
of
rebellious
and
distrustful
thought
she
had
determined
on
making
a
confession
to
rhoda
but
would
she
benefit
by
it
was
rhoda
generous
enough
to
appreciate
her
motives
it
did
not
matter
much
she
would
have
discharged
a
duty
at
the
expense
of
such
shame
and
this
fact
alone
might
strengthen
her
to
face
the
miseries
beyond
as
she
stood
at
miss
barfoot
door
her
heart
quailed
to
the
servant
who
opened
she
could
only
speak
miss
nunn
name
fortunately
instructions
had
been
given
and
she
was
straightway
led
to
the
library
here
she
waited
for
nearly
five
minutes
was
rhoda
doing
this
on
purpose
her
face
when
at
length
she
entered
made
it
seem
probable
a
cold
dignity
only
not
offensive
haughtiness
appeared
in
her
bearing
she
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
and
used
no
form
of
civility
beyond
requesting
her
visitor
to
be
seated
am
going
away
monica
began
when
silence
compelled
her
to
speak
so
you
told
me
can
see
that
you
ca
understand
why
i
have
come
note
only
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
their
eyes
met
and
monica
knew
in
the
moment
that
succeeded
that
she
was
being
examined
from
head
to
foot
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
undertaken
something
beyond
her
strength
her
impulse
was
to
invent
a
subject
of
brief
conversation
and
escape
into
the
darkness
but
miss
nunn
spoke
again
it
possible
that
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
you
might
be
but
i
find
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
what
i
rhoda
waited
offering
no
help
whatever
not
even
that
of
a
look
expressing
interest
you
tell
me
miss
nunn
why
you
behave
so
coldly
to
me
that
does
need
any
explanation
mrs
widdowson
mean
that
you
believe
everything
widdowson
has
said
widdowson
has
said
nothing
to
me
but
i
have
seen
your
sister
and
there
seemed
no
reason
to
doubt
what
she
told
me
could
tell
you
the
truth
because
she
does
know
it
presume
she
at
least
told
no
untruth
did
virginia
say
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
ask
that
rhoda
appeared
to
doubt
it
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
nearest
bookcase
and
for
a
moment
reflected
affairs
do
really
concern
me
widdowson
she
said
at
length
have
been
forced
upon
my
attention
and
perhaps
i
regard
them
from
a
wrong
point
of
view
unless
you
have
come
to
defend
yourself
against
a
false
accusation
is
there
any
profit
in
our
talking
of
these
things
come
for
that
i
am
not
so
unjust
as
to
refuse
to
hear
you
name
has
been
spoken
of
together
with
barfoot
this
is
wrong
it
began
from
a
mistake
monica
could
not
shape
her
phrases
hastening
to
utter
the
statement
that
would
relieve
her
from
miss
nunn
personal
displeasure
she
used
the
first
simple
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
i
went
to
bayswater
that
day
i
had
no
thought
of
seeing
barfoot
i
wished
to
see
someone
else
the
listener
manifested
more
attention
she
could
not
mistake
the
signs
of
sincerity
in
monica
look
and
speech
one
she
asked
coldly
was
living
with
mr
barfoot
some
one
in
the
same
building
in
another
flat
when
i
knocked
at
barfoot
door
i
knew
or
i
felt
sure
no
one
would
answer
i
knew
barfoot
was
going
away
that
day
going
into
cumberland
rhoda
look
was
fixed
on
the
speaker
countenance
knew
he
was
going
to
cumberland
she
asked
in
a
slow
careful
voice
told
me
so
i
met
him
quite
by
chance
the
day
before
did
you
meet
him
the
flats
monica
answered
colouring
had
just
come
out
i
saw
him
come
out
i
had
an
appointment
there
that
afternoon
and
i
walked
a
short
way
with
him
so
that
he
should
her
voice
failed
she
saw
that
rhoda
had
begun
to
mistrust
her
to
think
that
she
was
elaborating
falsehoods
the
burdensome
silence
was
broken
by
miss
nunn
saying
repellently
have
asked
for
your
confidence
remember
and
if
you
try
to
imagine
what
it
means
for
me
to
be
speaking
like
this
i
am
not
shameless
i
have
suffered
a
great
deal
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
come
here
and
tell
you
if
you
were
more
human
if
you
tried
to
believe
the
agitation
which
found
utterance
in
these
words
had
its
effect
upon
rhoda
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
touched
by
the
note
of
womanly
distress
have
you
come
why
do
you
tell
me
this
it
is
only
that
i
have
been
falsely
accused
i
felt
i
must
tell
you
that
barfoot
had
never
that
there
was
nothing
between
us
what
has
he
said
how
did
he
meet
the
charge
widdowson
made
against
him
by
denying
it
he
wished
to
appeal
to
do
know
i
have
heard
of
his
expressing
such
a
wish
i
see
that
you
are
called
upon
to
take
any
trouble
about
barfoot
he
ought
to
be
able
to
protect
his
own
reputation
he
done
so
monica
asked
eagerly
you
believe
him
when
he
denied
what
does
it
matter
whether
i
believed
him
or
not
would
think
it
mattered
a
great
deal
barfoot
would
think
so
why
told
me
how
much
he
wished
to
have
your
good
opinion
that
is
what
we
used
to
talk
about
i
do
know
why
he
took
me
into
his
confidence
it
happened
first
of
all
when
we
were
going
by
train
the
same
train
by
chance
after
we
had
both
been
calling
here
he
asked
me
many
questions
about
you
and
at
last
said
that
he
loved
you
or
something
that
meant
the
same
rhoda
eyes
had
fallen
that
pursued
monica
several
times
spoke
of
you
we
did
so
when
we
happened
to
meet
near
his
rooms
as
i
have
told
you
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
cumberland
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
and
i
understood
him
to
mean
he
wished
to
ask
you
the
sudden
and
great
change
in
miss
nunn
expression
checked
the
speaker
scornful
austerity
had
given
place
to
a
smile
stern
indeed
but
exultant
there
was
warmth
upon
her
face
her
lips
moved
and
relaxed
she
altered
her
position
in
the
chair
as
if
inclined
for
more
intimate
colloquy
was
never
more
than
that
between
us
pursued
monica
with
earnestness
interest
in
barfoot
was
only
on
your
account
i
hoped
he
might
be
successful
and
i
have
come
to
you
because
i
feared
you
would
believe
my
husband
as
i
see
you
have
done
rhoda
though
she
thought
it
very
unlikely
that
all
this
should
be
admirable
acting
showed
that
the
explanation
had
by
no
means
fully
satisfied
her
unwilling
to
put
the
crucial
question
she
waited
with
gravity
which
had
none
of
the
former
harshness
for
what
else
widdowson
might
choose
to
say
a
look
of
suffering
appeal
obliged
her
to
break
the
silence
am
very
sorry
you
have
laid
this
task
upon
yourself
still
monica
looked
at
her
and
at
length
murmured
only
i
could
know
that
i
had
done
any
good
said
rhoda
with
a
searching
glance
do
wish
me
to
repeat
what
you
have
said
was
only
for
you
i
thought
if
you
felt
able
to
let
barfoot
know
that
you
had
no
longer
any
a
flash
of
stern
intelligence
shot
from
the
listener
eyes
have
seen
him
then
she
asked
with
abrupt
directness
since
has
written
to
you
still
in
the
same
voice
he
has
not
barfoot
never
wrote
to
me
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
him
no
one
asked
me
to
come
to
you
do
think
that
no
one
knows
of
what
i
have
been
telling
you
again
rhoda
was
oppressed
by
the
difficulty
of
determining
how
much
credit
was
due
to
such
assertions
monica
understood
her
look
i
have
said
so
much
i
must
tell
you
all
it
would
be
dreadful
after
this
to
go
away
uncertain
whether
you
believed
me
or
not
human
feeling
prompted
the
listener
to
declare
that
she
had
no
doubts
left
yet
she
could
not
give
utterance
to
the
words
she
knew
they
would
sound
forced
insincere
shame
at
inflicting
shame
caused
her
to
bend
her
head
already
she
had
been
silent
too
long
will
tell
you
everything
monica
was
saying
in
low
tremulous
tones
no
one
else
believes
me
you
at
all
events
shall
i
have
not
done
what
i
ca
hear
this
rhoda
broke
in
the
speaker
voice
affecting
her
too
powerfully
will
believe
you
without
this
monica
broke
into
sobbing
the
strain
of
this
last
effort
had
overtaxed
her
strength
wo
talk
any
more
of
it
said
rhoda
with
an
endeavour
to
speak
kindly
have
done
all
that
could
be
asked
of
you
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
coming
on
my
account
the
other
controlled
herself
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
miss
nunn
will
you
hear
it
as
a
friend
i
want
to
put
myself
right
in
your
thoughts
i
have
told
no
one
else
i
shall
be
easier
in
mind
if
you
will
hear
me
my
husband
will
know
everything
before
very
long
but
perhaps
i
shall
not
be
alive
something
in
miss
nunn
face
suggested
to
monica
that
her
meaning
was
understood
perhaps
notwithstanding
her
denial
virginia
had
told
more
when
she
was
here
than
she
had
permission
to
make
known
should
you
wish
to
tell
asked
rhoda
uneasily
you
are
so
strong
you
will
say
something
that
will
help
me
i
know
you
think
that
i
have
committed
a
sin
which
it
is
a
shame
to
speak
of
that
is
true
if
it
were
true
i
should
never
consent
to
go
and
live
in
my
husband
house
are
returning
to
him
forgot
that
i
have
told
you
and
monica
related
the
agreement
that
had
been
arrived
at
when
she
spoke
of
the
time
that
must
elapse
before
she
would
make
a
confession
to
her
husband
it
again
seemed
to
her
that
miss
nunn
understood
is
a
reason
why
i
consent
to
be
supported
by
him
she
continued
it
were
true
that
i
had
sinned
as
he
suspects
i
would
rather
kill
myself
than
pretend
still
to
be
his
wife
the
day
before
he
had
me
watched
i
thought
i
had
left
him
forever
i
thought
that
if
i
went
back
to
the
house
again
it
would
only
be
to
get
a
few
things
that
i
needed
it
was
some
one
who
lived
in
the
same
building
as
barfoot
you
have
met
him
she
raised
her
eyes
for
an
instant
and
they
encountered
the
listener
rhoda
was
at
no
loss
to
supply
the
omitted
name
she
saw
at
once
how
plain
things
were
becoming
has
left
england
pursued
monica
in
a
hurried
but
clear
voice
thought
then
that
i
should
go
away
with
him
but
it
was
impossible
i
loved
him
or
thought
i
loved
him
but
i
was
guiltless
of
anything
more
than
consenting
to
leave
my
husband
will
you
believe
me
monica
i
do
believe
you
you
have
any
doubt
i
can
show
you
a
letter
he
wrote
to
me
from
abroad
which
will
prove
believe
you
absolutely
let
me
tell
you
more
i
must
explain
how
the
misunderstanding
rapidly
she
recounted
the
incidents
of
that
fatal
saturday
afternoon
at
the
conclusion
her
was
again
overcome
she
shed
tears
and
murmured
broken
entreaties
for
kindness
shall
i
do
miss
nunn
how
can
i
live
until
i
know
it
only
for
a
short
time
my
wretched
life
will
soon
be
at
an
end
there
is
one
thing
you
must
remember
the
voice
was
so
gentle
though
firm
so
unlike
what
she
had
expected
to
hear
that
the
sufferer
looked
up
with
grateful
attention
me
give
me
what
help
you
can
seems
so
bitter
to
you
that
you
are
in
despair
yet
is
it
your
duty
to
live
as
though
some
hope
were
before
you
monica
gazed
in
uncertainty
mean
she
faltered
think
you
will
understand
i
am
not
speaking
of
your
husband
whether
you
have
duties
to
him
or
not
i
ca
say
that
is
for
your
own
mind
and
heart
to
determine
but
is
it
true
that
your
health
has
a
graver
importance
than
if
you
yourself
only
were
concerned
you
have
understood
me
it
your
duty
to
remember
at
every
moment
that
your
thoughts
your
actions
may
affect
another
life
that
by
heedlessness
by
abandoning
yourself
to
despair
you
may
be
the
cause
of
suffering
it
was
in
your
power
to
avert
herself
strongly
moved
rhoda
had
never
spoken
so
impressively
had
never
given
counsel
of
such
earnest
significance
she
felt
her
power
in
quite
a
new
way
without
touch
of
vanity
without
posing
or
any
trivial
when
she
least
expected
it
an
opportunity
had
come
for
exerting
the
moral
influence
on
which
she
prided
herself
and
which
she
hoped
to
make
the
ennobling
element
of
her
life
all
the
better
that
the
case
was
one
calling
for
courage
for
contempt
of
vulgar
reticences
the
combative
soul
in
her
became
stronger
when
faced
by
such
conditions
seeing
that
her
words
were
not
in
vain
she
came
nearer
to
monica
and
spoke
yet
more
kindly
do
you
encourage
that
fear
of
your
life
coming
to
an
end
more
a
hope
than
a
fear
at
most
times
i
can
see
nothing
before
me
i
do
wish
to
live
morbid
it
is
yourself
that
speaks
but
your
trouble
you
are
young
and
strong
and
in
a
year
time
very
much
of
this
unhappiness
will
have
passed
have
felt
it
like
a
certainty
as
if
it
had
been
foretold
to
me
ever
since
i
knew
think
it
very
likely
that
young
wives
have
often
the
same
dread
it
is
physical
monica
and
in
your
case
there
is
so
little
relief
from
dark
brooding
but
again
you
must
think
of
your
responsibility
you
will
live
because
the
poor
little
life
will
need
your
care
monica
turned
her
head
away
and
moaned
shall
not
love
my
child
you
will
and
that
love
that
duty
is
the
life
to
which
you
must
look
forward
you
have
suffered
a
great
deal
but
after
such
sorrow
as
yours
there
comes
quietness
and
resignation
nature
will
help
you
if
you
could
give
me
some
of
strength
i
have
never
been
able
to
look
at
life
as
you
do
i
should
never
have
married
him
if
i
had
been
tempted
by
the
thoughts
of
living
easily
and
i
feared
so
that
i
might
always
be
alone
my
sisters
are
so
miserable
it
terrified
me
to
think
of
struggling
on
through
life
as
they
do
mistake
was
in
looking
only
at
the
weak
women
you
had
other
examples
before
you
girls
like
miss
vesper
and
miss
haven
who
live
bravely
and
work
hard
and
are
proud
of
their
place
in
the
world
but
it
idle
to
talk
of
the
past
and
just
as
foolish
to
speak
as
if
you
were
sorrowing
without
hope
how
old
are
you
monica
i
am
and
i
do
call
myself
old
when
you
have
reached
my
age
i
prophesy
you
will
smile
at
your
despair
of
ten
years
ago
at
your
age
one
talks
so
readily
of
wrecked
life
and
hopeless
future
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
my
dear
girl
you
may
live
to
be
one
of
the
most
contented
and
most
useful
women
in
england
your
life
is
wrecked
at
all
nonsense
you
have
gone
through
a
storm
true
but
more
likely
than
not
you
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
talk
or
think
about
simply
make
up
your
mind
that
you
wo
be
beaten
by
trials
and
hardships
there
can
not
can
there
be
the
least
doubt
as
to
how
you
ought
to
live
through
these
next
coming
months
your
duty
is
perfectly
clear
strengthen
yourself
in
body
and
mind
you
a
mind
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
a
great
many
women
think
bravely
and
nobly
of
yourself
say
to
yourself
this
and
that
it
is
in
me
to
do
and
i
will
do
it
monica
bent
suddenly
forward
and
took
one
of
her
friend
hands
and
clung
to
it
knew
you
could
say
something
that
would
help
me
you
have
a
way
of
speaking
but
it
is
only
now
i
shall
be
so
far
away
and
so
lonely
all
through
the
dark
winter
will
you
write
to
me
and
tell
you
all
we
are
doing
rhoda
voice
sank
for
a
moment
her
eyes
wandered
but
she
recovered
the
air
of
confidence
seemed
to
have
lost
you
but
before
long
you
will
be
one
of
us
again
i
mean
you
will
be
one
of
the
women
who
are
fighting
in
cause
you
will
prove
by
your
life
that
we
can
be
responsible
human
beings
trustworthy
conscious
of
purpose
me
do
you
think
it
right
for
me
to
live
with
my
husband
when
i
ca
even
regard
him
as
a
friend
that
i
dare
not
counsel
you
if
you
think
of
him
as
a
friend
in
time
to
come
surely
it
will
be
better
but
here
you
must
guide
yourself
you
seem
to
have
made
a
very
sensible
arrangement
and
before
long
you
will
see
many
things
more
clearly
try
to
recover
health
health
that
is
what
you
need
drink
in
the
air
of
the
severn
sea
it
will
be
a
cordial
to
you
after
this
stifling
london
next
summer
i
shall
i
hope
i
shall
be
at
cheddar
and
then
i
shall
come
over
to
clevedon
and
we
shall
laugh
and
talk
as
if
we
had
never
known
a
care
if
that
time
were
come
but
you
have
done
me
good
i
shall
try
she
rose
must
forget
said
rhoda
without
looking
at
her
i
owe
you
thanks
you
have
done
what
you
felt
was
right
in
spite
of
all
it
cost
you
and
you
have
very
greatly
relieved
my
mind
of
course
it
is
all
a
secret
between
us
if
i
make
it
understood
that
a
doubt
is
no
longer
troubling
me
i
shall
never
say
how
it
was
removed
i
wish
i
had
come
before
your
own
sake
if
i
have
really
helped
you
i
wish
you
had
but
as
for
anything
else
it
is
much
better
as
it
is
and
rhoda
stood
with
erect
head
smiling
her
smile
of
liberty
monica
did
not
dare
to
ask
any
question
she
moved
up
to
her
friend
holding
out
both
hands
timidly
next
summer
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
monica
when
she
had
withdrawn
her
hot
lips
again
murmuring
words
of
gratitude
then
in
silence
they
went
together
to
the
and
in
silence
parted
chapter

retreat
with
honour
alighting
on
his
return
to
london
at
the
savoy
hotel
barfoot
insensibly
prolonged
his
stay
there
for
the
present
he
had
no
need
of
a
more
private
dwelling
he
could
not
see
more
than
a
few
days
ahead
his
next
decisive
step
was
as
uncertain
as
it
had
been
during
the
first
few
months
after
his
coming
back
from
the
east
meantime
he
led
a
sufficiently
agreeable
life
the
brissendens
were
not
in
town
but
his
growing
intimacy
with
that
family
had
extended
his
social
outlook
and
in
a
direction
correspondent
with
the
change
in
his
own
circumstances
he
was
making
friends
in
the
world
with
which
he
had
a
natural
affinity
that
of
wealthy
and
cultured
people
who
seek
no
prominence
who
shrink
from
contact
with
the
circles
known
as
who
possess
their
souls
in
quiet
freedom
it
is
a
small
class
especially
distinguished
by
the
charm
of
its
women
everard
had
not
adapted
himself
without
difficulty
to
this
new
atmosphere
from
the
first
he
recognized
its
soothing
and
bracing
quality
but
his
experiences
had
accustomed
him
to
an
air
more
rudely
vigorous
it
was
only
after
those
weeks
spent
abroad
in
frequent
intercourse
with
the
brissendens
that
he
came
to
understand
the
full
extent
of
his
sympathy
with
the
social
principles
these
men
and
women
represented
in
the
houses
where
his
welcome
was
now
assured
he
met
some
three
or
four
women
among
whom
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
assign
the
precedence
for
grace
of
manner
and
of
mind
these
persons
were
not
in
declared
revolt
against
the
order
of
things
religious
ethical
or
social
that
is
to
say
they
did
not
think
it
worthwhile
to
identify
themselves
with
any
they
were
content
with
the
unopposed
right
of
liberal
criticism
they
lived
placidly
refraining
from
much
that
the
larger
world
enjoined
but
never
aggressive
everard
admired
them
with
increasing
fervour
with
one
exception
they
were
married
and
suitably
married
that
member
of
the
charming
group
who
kept
her
maiden
freedom
was
agnes
brissenden
and
it
seemed
to
barfoot
that
if
preference
were
at
all
justified
agnes
should
receive
the
palm
his
view
of
her
had
greatly
changed
since
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
in
fact
he
perceived
that
till
of
late
he
had
not
known
her
at
all
his
quick
assumption
that
agnes
was
at
his
disposal
if
he
chose
to
woo
her
had
been
mere
fatuity
he
misread
her
perfect
simplicity
of
demeanour
the
unconstraint
of
her
intellectual
sympathies
what
might
now
be
her
personal
attitude
to
him
he
felt
altogether
uncertain
and
the
result
was
a
genuine
humility
such
as
he
had
never
known
nor
was
it
agnes
only
that
subdued
his
masculine
her
sisters
in
grace
had
scarcely
less
dominion
over
him
and
at
times
as
he
sat
conversing
in
one
of
these
he
broke
off
to
marvel
at
himself
to
appreciate
the
perfection
of
his
own
suavity
the
vast
advance
he
had
been
making
in
polished
humanism
towards
the
end
of
november
he
learnt
that
the
brissendens
were
at
their
town
house
and
a
week
later
he
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
them
over
his
luncheon
at
the
hotel
everard
reflected
with
some
gravity
for
if
he
were
not
mistaken
the
hour
had
come
when
he
must
make
up
his
mind
on
a
point
too
long
in
suspense
what
was
rhoda
nunn
doing
he
had
heard
nothing
whatever
of
her
his
cousin
mary
wrote
to
him
whilst
he
was
at
ostend
in
a
kind
and
friendly
tone
informing
him
that
his
simple
assurance
with
regard
to
a
certain
disagreeable
matter
was
all
she
had
desired
and
hoping
that
he
would
come
and
see
her
as
usual
when
he
found
himself
in
london
but
he
had
kept
away
from
the
house
in
queen
road
and
it
was
probable
that
mary
did
not
even
know
his
address
as
the
result
of
meditation
he
went
to
his
and
with
an
air
of
reluctance
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
it
was
a
request
that
mary
would
let
him
see
her
somewhere
or
other
not
at
her
house
could
they
have
a
talk
at
the
place
in
great
portland
street
when
no
one
else
was
there
miss
barfoot
answered
with
brief
assent
if
he
liked
to
come
to
great
portland
street
at
three
on
saturday
she
would
be
awaiting
him
on
arriving
he
inspected
the
rooms
with
curiosity
have
often
wished
to
come
here
mary
show
me
over
the
premises
will
you
was
your
purpose
not
altogether
but
you
know
how
your
work
interests
me
mary
complied
and
freely
answered
his
various
questions
then
they
sat
down
on
hard
chairs
by
the
fire
and
everard
leaning
forward
as
if
to
warm
his
hands
lost
no
more
time
in
coming
to
the
point
want
to
hear
about
miss
nunn
hear
about
her
pray
what
do
you
wish
to
hear
she
well
well
indeed
very
glad
of
that
does
she
ever
speak
of
me
me
see
i
do
think
she
has
referred
to
you
lately
everard
looked
up
let
us
play
a
comedy
mary
i
want
to
talk
very
seriously
shall
i
tell
you
what
happened
when
i
went
to
seascale
you
went
to
seascale
did
you
you
know
that
he
asked
unable
to
decide
the
question
from
his
cousin
face
which
was
quite
friendly
but
inscrutable
went
when
miss
nunn
was
there
course
you
must
have
known
i
was
going
when
i
asked
you
for
her
seascale
address
what
did
happen
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
if
you
feel
at
liberty
to
tell
me
after
a
pause
everard
began
the
narrative
but
he
did
not
see
fit
to
give
it
with
all
the
detail
which
mary
had
learnt
from
her
friend
he
spoke
of
the
excursion
to
wastwater
and
of
the
subsequent
meeting
on
the
shore
end
of
it
was
that
miss
nunn
consented
to
marry
me
consented
comes
as
a
surprise
go
on
we
arranged
everything
rhoda
was
to
stay
till
the
fifteen
days
were
over
and
the
marriage
would
have
been
there
but
then
arrived
your
letter
and
we
quarrelled
about
it
i
was
disposed
to
beg
and
pray
for
justice
i
told
rhoda
that
her
wish
for
evidence
was
an
insult
that
i
would
take
no
step
to
understand
behaviour
rhoda
was
illogical
i
think
she
did
not
refuse
to
take
my
word
but
she
would
marry
me
until
the
thing
was
cleared
up
i
told
her
that
she
must
investigate
it
for
herself
and
so
we
parted
in
no
very
good
temper
miss
barfoot
smiled
and
mused
her
duty
she
now
felt
convinced
was
to
abstain
from
any
sort
of
meddling
these
two
people
must
settle
their
affairs
as
they
chose
to
interfere
was
to
incur
an
enormous
responsibility
for
what
she
had
already
done
in
that
way
mary
reproved
herself
i
want
to
ask
you
a
plain
question
everard
resumed
letter
you
wrote
to
me
at
ostend
did
it
represent
rhoda
mind
as
well
as
your
own
quite
impossible
for
me
to
say
i
did
know
rhoda
mind
perhaps
that
is
a
satisfactory
answer
it
implies
no
doubt
that
she
was
still
resolved
not
to
concede
the
point
on
which
i
insisted
but
since
then
has
she
come
to
a
decision
it
was
necessary
to
prevaricate
mary
knew
of
the
interview
between
miss
nunn
and
widdowson
knew
its
result
but
she
would
not
hint
at
this
have
no
means
of
judging
how
she
regards
you
everard
is
possible
she
even
thinks
me
a
liar
understood
you
to
say
that
she
never
refused
to
believe
you
he
made
a
movement
of
impatience
you
will
tell
me
nothing
have
nothing
to
tell
i
suppose
i
must
see
rhoda
perhaps
she
will
refuse
to
admit
me
ca
say
but
if
she
does
her
meaning
would
be
unmistakable
mary
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
think
you
will
be
very
glad
if
she
refuse
she
seemed
about
to
reply
with
some
pleasantry
but
checked
herself
and
spoke
in
a
serious
voice
i
have
no
such
feeling
whatever
you
both
agree
upon
will
satisfy
me
so
come
by
all
means
if
you
wish
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
had
better
write
and
ask
her
if
she
will
see
you
i
should
think
barfoot
rose
from
his
seat
and
mary
was
glad
to
be
released
so
quickly
from
a
disagreeable
situation
for
her
own
part
she
had
no
need
to
put
indiscreet
questions
everard
manner
acquainted
her
quite
sufficiently
with
what
was
going
on
in
his
thoughts
however
he
had
still
something
to
say
think
i
have
behaved
rather
badly
let
us
say
harshly
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
form
any
judgment
in
such
a
case
cousin
everard
as
a
woman
should
you
say
that
rhoda
had
reason
on
her
side
in
the
first
instance
think
mary
replied
with
reluctance
but
deliberately
she
was
not
unreasonable
in
wishing
to
postpone
her
marriage
until
she
knew
what
was
to
be
the
result
of
widdowson
indiscreet
behaviour
perhaps
she
was
not
everard
admitted
thoughtfully
what
been
the
result
only
know
that
widdowson
has
left
london
and
gone
to
live
at
a
house
her
husband
has
taken
somewhere
in
the
country
relieved
to
hear
that
the
little
lady
indiscreet
behaviour
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
ever
to
me
mary
replied
with
an
air
of
indifference
then
let
us
take
it
for
granted
that
i
was
rather
harsh
with
rhoda
but
suppose
she
still
meets
me
with
the
remark
that
things
are
just
as
they
were
that
nothing
has
been
explained
ca
discuss
your
relations
with
miss
nunn
you
defend
her
original
action
be
so
good
as
to
admit
that
i
ca
go
to
widdowson
and
request
her
to
publish
a
statement
that
i
have
never
shall
admit
nothing
interrupted
miss
barfoot
rather
tartily
have
advised
you
to
see
miss
nunn
if
she
is
willing
and
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
will
write
to
her
he
did
so
in
the
fewest
possible
words
and
received
an
answer
of
equal
brevity
in
accordance
with
permission
granted
on
the
monday
evening
he
found
himself
once
more
in
his
cousin
sitting
alone
waiting
miss
nunn
appearance
he
wondered
how
she
would
present
herself
in
what
costume
her
garb
proved
to
be
a
plain
dress
of
blue
serge
certainly
not
calculated
for
effect
but
his
eye
at
once
distinguished
the
fact
that
she
had
arranged
her
hair
as
she
wore
it
when
he
first
knew
her
a
fashion
subsequently
abandoned
for
one
that
he
thought
more
becoming
they
shook
hands
externally
barfoot
was
the
more
agitated
and
his
embarrassment
appeared
in
the
awkward
words
with
which
he
began
had
made
up
my
mind
never
to
come
until
you
let
me
know
that
i
was
tried
and
acquitted
but
after
all
it
is
better
to
have
reason
on
side
better
replied
rhoda
with
a
smile
which
emphasized
her
ambiguity
she
sat
down
and
he
followed
her
example
their
relative
positions
called
to
mind
many
a
conversation
they
had
held
in
this
room
barfoot
he
wore
settled
in
the
comfortable
chair
as
though
he
were
an
ordinary
guest
suppose
you
would
never
have
written
to
me
she
answered
quietly
you
are
too
proud
or
because
the
mystery
is
still
a
mystery
is
no
longer
any
mystery
everard
made
a
movement
of
surprise
you
have
discovered
what
it
all
meant
i
know
what
it
all
meant
you
gratify
my
not
unnatural
curiosity
can
say
nothing
about
it
except
that
i
know
how
the
misunderstanding
arose
rhoda
was
betraying
the
effort
it
had
cost
her
to
seem
so
when
she
entered
her
colour
had
deepened
and
she
spoke
hurriedly
unevenly
it
did
occur
to
you
that
it
would
be
a
kindness
not
inconsistent
with
your
dignity
to
make
me
in
some
way
acquainted
with
this
fact
feel
no
uneasiness
on
your
account
everard
laughed
frank
as
of
old
you
really
did
care
in
the
least
how
much
i
suffered
misunderstand
me
i
felt
sure
that
you
did
suffer
at
all
i
see
you
imagined
me
calm
in
the
assurance
that
i
should
some
day
be
justified
had
every
reason
for
imagining
it
rejoined
rhoda
you
would
have
given
some
sign
of
course
he
had
deeply
offended
her
by
his
persistent
silence
he
had
intended
to
do
so
first
of
all
and
afterwards
had
thought
it
might
be
as
well
now
that
he
had
got
over
the
difficulty
of
the
meeting
he
enjoyed
his
sense
of
security
how
the
interview
would
end
he
know
not
but
on
his
side
there
would
be
nothing
hasty
unconsidered
merely
emotional
had
rhoda
any
new
revelation
of
personality
within
her
resources
that
was
the
question
if
so
he
would
be
pleased
to
observe
it
if
not
why
it
was
only
the
end
to
which
he
had
long
ago
looked
forward
was
not
for
me
to
give
any
sign
he
remarked
you
have
said
that
it
is
well
to
have
reason
on
one
side
perhaps
a
softer
note
allowed
itself
to
be
detected
in
these
words
in
any
case
they
were
not
plainly
ironical
then
that
an
approach
was
due
from
me
i
have
made
it
i
am
here
rhoda
said
nothing
yet
she
had
not
an
air
of
expectancy
her
eye
was
grave
rather
sad
as
though
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
what
was
at
issue
and
had
lost
herself
in
remoter
thought
regarding
her
everard
felt
a
nobility
in
her
countenance
which
amply
justified
all
he
had
ever
felt
and
said
but
was
there
anything
more
any
new
power
we
go
back
he
pursued
our
day
at
wastwater
the
perfect
day
was
it
shall
never
wish
to
forget
it
said
rhoda
reflectively
we
stand
as
when
we
quitted
each
other
that
night
do
we
she
glanced
at
him
think
not
what
is
the
difference
he
waited
some
seconds
and
repeated
the
question
before
rhoda
answered
are
conscious
of
no
difference
she
said
have
elapsed
we
are
different
because
we
are
older
but
you
speak
as
if
you
were
conscious
of
some
greater
change
you
are
changed
noticeably
i
thought
i
knew
you
perhaps
i
did
now
i
should
have
to
learn
you
all
over
again
it
is
difficult
you
see
for
me
to
keep
pace
with
you
your
opportunities
are
so
much
wider
this
was
puzzling
did
it
signify
mere
jealousy
or
a
profounder
view
of
things
her
voice
had
something
even
of
pathos
as
though
she
uttered
a
simple
thought
without
caustic
intention
try
not
to
waste
my
life
he
answered
seriously
have
made
new
acquaintances
you
tell
me
about
them
me
first
about
yourself
you
say
you
would
never
have
written
to
me
that
means
i
think
that
you
never
loved
me
when
you
found
that
i
had
been
wrongly
suspected
and
you
suspected
me
yourself
say
what
you
will
if
you
had
loved
me
you
would
have
asked
forgiveness
have
a
like
reason
for
doubting
love
if
you
had
loved
me
you
could
never
have
waited
so
long
without
trying
to
remove
the
obstacle
that
was
between
us
was
you
who
put
the
obstacle
there
said
everard
smiling
an
unlucky
chance
did
that
or
a
lucky
one
who
knows
he
began
to
think
if
this
woman
had
enjoyed
the
social
advantages
to
which
agnes
brissenden
and
those
others
were
doubtless
indebted
for
so
much
of
their
charm
would
she
not
have
been
their
equal
or
more
for
the
first
time
he
compassionated
rhoda
she
was
brave
and
circumstances
had
not
been
kind
to
her
at
this
moment
was
she
not
contending
with
herself
was
not
her
honesty
her
dignity
struggling
against
the
impulses
of
her
heart
rhoda
love
had
been
worth
more
than
his
and
it
would
be
her
one
love
in
life
a
fatuous
reflection
perhaps
yet
every
moment
observation
seemed
to
confirm
it
now
he
said
the
question
which
we
must
decide
if
you
incline
to
think
that
the
chance
was
fortunate
she
would
not
speak
must
know
each
other
mind
that
is
so
difficult
rhoda
murmured
just
raising
her
hand
and
letting
it
fall
unless
we
give
each
other
help
let
us
imagine
ourselves
back
at
seascale
down
by
the
waves
how
cold
and
grim
it
must
be
there
i
repeat
what
i
said
then
rhoda
will
you
marry
me
she
looked
fixedly
at
him
did
say
that
then
do
the
words
matter
was
not
what
you
said
he
watched
the
agitation
of
her
features
until
his
gaze
seemed
to
compel
her
to
move
she
stepped
towards
the
fireplace
and
moved
a
little
screen
that
stood
too
near
the
fender
do
you
want
me
to
repeat
exactly
what
i
said
everard
asked
rising
and
following
her
speak
of
the
perfect
day
did
the
day
perfection
end
before
there
was
any
word
of
marriage
he
looked
at
her
with
surprise
she
had
spoken
without
turning
her
face
towards
him
it
was
visible
now
only
by
the
glow
of
the
fire
yes
what
she
said
was
true
but
a
truth
which
he
had
neither
expected
nor
desired
to
hear
had
the
new
revelation
prepared
itself
first
used
the
word
rhoda
i
did
there
was
silence
rhoda
stood
unmoving
the
fire
glow
upon
her
face
and
barfoot
watched
her
he
said
at
length
was
not
quite
serious
when
i
she
turned
sharply
upon
him
a
flash
of
indignation
in
her
eyes
quite
serious
yes
i
have
thought
that
and
were
you
quite
serious
in
you
said
loved
you
he
answered
curtly
answering
her
steady
look
wanted
to
see
whether
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
her
throat
quivered
loved
you
that
all
and
i
believe
i
still
love
you
rhoda
turned
to
the
fire
again
you
marry
me
he
asked
moving
a
step
nearer
think
you
are
not
quite
serious
have
asked
you
twice
i
ask
for
the
third
time
wo
marry
you
with
the
forms
of
marriage
rhoda
answered
in
an
abrupt
harsh
tone
it
is
you
who
play
with
a
serious
matter
said
we
had
both
changed
i
see
now
that
our
perfect
day
was
marred
by
my
weakness
at
the
end
if
you
wish
to
go
back
in
imagination
to
that
summer
night
restore
everything
only
let
be
what
i
now
am
everard
shook
his
head
it
must
be
then
or
now
for
both
of
us
marriage
she
said
glancing
at
him
acquired
some
new
sanction
for
you
since
then
the
whole
perhaps
it
has
but
i
shall
never
marry
so
we
will
speak
no
more
of
it
as
if
finally
dismissing
the
subject
she
walked
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
there
turned
towards
her
companion
with
a
cold
smile
other
words
then
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
i
no
longer
love
you
if
i
had
been
willing
to
revive
that
fantastic
idealism
as
you
thought
it
she
interrupted
him
sternly
it
a
kind
of
idealism
undoubtedly
i
was
so
bent
on
making
sure
that
you
loved
me
she
laughed
all
the
perfection
of
our
day
was
half
you
never
loved
me
with
entire
sincerity
and
you
will
never
love
any
woman
even
as
well
as
you
loved
me
my
soul
i
believe
it
rhoda
and
even
now
even
now
it
is
just
possible
for
us
to
say
goodbye
with
something
like
friendliness
but
not
if
you
talk
longer
do
let
us
spoil
it
things
are
so
straight
and
clear
a
threatened
sob
made
her
break
off
but
she
recovered
herself
and
offered
him
her
hand
he
walked
all
the
way
back
to
his
hotel
and
the
cold
clammy
night
restored
his
equanimity
a
fortnight
later
sending
a
christmas
present
with
greetings
to
and
micklethwaite
he
wrote
thus
am
about
to
do
my
duty
as
you
put
it
that
is
to
marry
the
name
of
my
future
wife
is
miss
agnes
brissenden
it
will
be
in
march
i
think
but
i
shall
see
you
before
then
and
give
you
a
fuller
account
of
myself
chapter
xxxi
a
new
beginning
widdowson
tried
two
or
three
lodgings
he
settled
at
length
in
a
small
house
at
hampstead
occupying
two
plain
rooms
here
at
long
intervals
his
friend
newdick
came
to
see
him
but
no
one
else
he
had
brought
with
him
a
selection
of
solid
books
from
his
library
and
over
these
the
greater
part
of
each
day
was
spent
not
that
he
studied
with
any
zeal
reading
and
of
a
kind
that
demanded
close
attention
was
his
only
resource
against
melancholia
he
knew
not
how
else
to
occupy
himself
adam
smith
classical
work
perused
with
laborious
thoroughness
gave
him
employment
for
a
couple
of
months
subsequently
he
plodded
through
all
the
volumes
of
hallam
his
landlady
and
the
neighbours
who
were
at
leisure
to
observe
him
when
he
went
out
for
his
two
hours
walk
in
the
afternoon
took
him
for
an
old
gentleman
of
or
so
he
no
longer
held
himself
upright
and
when
out
of
doors
seldom
raised
his
eyes
from
the
ground
grey
streaks
had
begun
to
brindle
his
hair
his
face
grew
yellower
and
more
deeply
furrowed
of
his
personal
appearance
even
of
cleanliness
he
became
neglectful
and
occasionally
it
happened
that
he
lay
in
bed
all
through
the
morning
reading
dozing
or
in
a
state
of
mental
vacuity
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
his
relative
the
sprightly
widow
but
he
had
heard
from
her
on
the
point
of
leaving
england
for
her
summer
holiday
luke
sent
him
a
few
lines
urging
him
in
the
language
of
the
world
to
live
more
sensibly
and
let
his
wife
her
head
now
and
then
it
would
be
better
for
both
of
them
then
followed
the
time
of
woe
and
for
many
weeks
he
gave
no
thought
to
luke
but
close
upon
the
end
of
the
year
he
received
one
day
a
certain
society
journal
addressed
in
a
hand
he
knew
to
the
house
at
herne
hill
in
it
was
discoverable
marked
with
a
red
pencil
the
following
paragraph
the
english
who
this
year
elected
to
take
their
repose
and
recreation
at
trouville
there
was
no
more
brilliant
figure
than
luke
widdowson
this
lady
is
well
known
in
the
where
one
never
where
smart
people
are
gathered
together
there
is
the
charming
widow
sure
to
be
seen
we
are
able
to
announce
that
before
leaving
trouville
widdowson
had
consented
to
a
private
engagement
with
capt
william
horrocks
no
other
indeed
than
captain
bill
the
universal
favourite
so
beloved
by
hostesses
as
a
sure
dancing
man
by
the
lamented
death
of
his
father
this
best
of
good
fellows
has
now
become
sir
william
and
we
understand
that
his
marriage
will
be
celebrated
after
the
proper
delays
our
congratulations
subsequently
arrived
a
newspaper
with
an
account
of
the
marriage
luke
was
now
lady
horrocks
she
had
the
title
desired
of
her
heart
another
two
months
went
by
and
there
came
a
letter
like
the
other
communications
at
the
post
office
in
which
the
wife
declared
herself
anxious
to
hear
of
her
friends
she
found
they
had
left
herne
hill
if
this
letter
reached
him
would
not
edmund
come
and
see
her
at
her
house
in
wimpole
street
misery
of
solitude
desire
for
a
woman
sympathy
and
counsel
impelled
him
to
use
this
opportunity
little
as
it
seemed
to
promise
he
went
to
wimpole
street
and
had
a
very
long
private
talk
with
lady
horrocks
who
in
some
way
he
could
not
understand
had
changed
from
her
old
self
she
began
frivolously
but
in
rather
a
dull
way
and
when
she
heard
that
widdowson
had
parted
from
his
wife
when
a
few
vague
miserable
words
had
suggested
the
domestic
drama
so
familiar
to
her
observation
she
at
once
grew
quiet
sober
sympathetic
as
if
really
glad
to
have
something
serious
to
talk
about
look
here
edmund
tell
the
whole
story
from
the
first
you
the
sort
of
man
to
make
awful
blunders
in
such
a
case
as
this
just
tell
me
all
about
it
i
not
a
bad
sort
you
know
and
i
have
troubles
of
my
own
i
do
mind
telling
you
so
much
women
make
fools
of
themselves
well
never
mind
just
tell
me
about
the
little
girl
and
see
if
we
ca
square
things
somehow
he
had
a
struggle
with
himself
but
at
length
narrated
everything
often
interrupted
by
shrewd
questions
one
writes
to
you
the
listener
finally
inquired
am
expecting
to
hear
from
them
was
widdowson
answer
as
he
sat
in
the
usual
position
head
hanging
forward
and
hands
clasped
between
his
knees
hear
what
think
i
shall
be
sent
for
for
to
make
it
up
is
going
to
give
birth
to
a
child
lady
horrocks
nodded
twice
thoughtfully
and
with
a
faint
smile
did
you
find
this
out
have
known
it
long
enough
her
sister
virginia
told
me
before
they
went
away
i
had
a
suspicion
all
at
once
and
i
forced
her
to
tell
me
if
you
are
sent
for
shall
you
go
widdowson
seemed
to
mutter
an
affirmative
and
added
shall
hear
what
she
has
to
tell
me
as
she
promised
it
is
it
possible
the
lady
question
remained
incomplete
widdowson
though
he
understood
it
vouchsafed
no
direct
answer
intense
suffering
was
manifest
in
his
face
and
at
length
he
spoke
vehemently
she
tells
me
how
can
i
believe
it
when
once
a
woman
has
lied
how
can
she
ever
again
be
believed
i
ca
be
sure
of
anything
that
fibbing
remarked
lady
horrocks
an
unpleasant
look
no
denying
it
she
got
entangled
somehow
but
i
think
you
had
better
believe
that
she
pulled
up
just
in
time
have
no
love
for
her
left
he
went
on
in
a
despairing
voice
all
perished
in
those
frightful
days
i
tried
hard
to
think
that
i
still
loved
her
i
kept
writing
letters
but
they
meant
nothing
or
they
only
meant
that
i
was
driven
half
crazy
by
wretchedness
i
had
rather
we
lived
on
as
we
have
been
doing
it
miserable
enough
for
me
god
knows
but
it
would
be
worse
to
try
and
behave
to
her
as
if
i
could
forget
everything
i
know
her
explanation
wo
satisfy
me
whatever
it
is
i
shall
still
suspect
her
i
do
know
that
the
child
is
mine
it
may
be
perhaps
as
it
grows
up
there
will
be
a
likeness
to
help
me
to
make
sure
but
what
a
life
every
paltry
trifle
will
make
me
uneasy
and
if
i
discovered
any
fresh
deceit
i
should
do
something
terrible
you
do
know
how
near
i
was
he
shuddered
and
hid
his
face
othello
business
wo
do
said
lady
horrocks
not
unkindly
could
have
gone
on
together
of
course
you
had
to
part
for
a
time
well
that
all
over
take
it
as
something
that
could
be
helped
you
were
behaving
absurdly
you
know
i
told
you
plainly
i
guessed
there
be
trouble
you
ought
to
have
married
at
all
that
the
fact
it
would
be
better
for
most
of
us
if
we
kept
out
of
it
some
marry
for
a
good
reason
some
for
a
bad
and
mostly
it
all
comes
to
the
same
in
the
end
but
there
never
mind
pull
yourself
together
dear
boy
it
all
nonsense
about
not
caring
for
her
of
course
eating
your
heart
out
for
want
of
her
and
i
tell
you
what
i
think
it
very
likely
monica
was
pulled
up
just
in
time
by
discovering
you
understand
that
she
was
more
your
wife
than
any
one
else
something
tells
me
that
how
it
was
just
try
to
look
at
it
in
that
way
if
the
child
lives
she
be
different
she
has
sowed
her
wild
oats
why
should
a
woman
as
well
as
a
man
go
down
to
clevedon
and
forgive
her
you
an
honest
man
and
it
is
every
woman
never
mind
i
could
tell
you
stories
about
people
but
you
would
care
to
hear
them
just
take
things
with
a
laugh
we
have
to
life
as
you
take
it
all
gloom
or
moderately
shiny
with
much
more
to
the
same
solacing
effect
for
the
time
widdowson
was
perchance
a
trifle
comforted
at
all
events
he
went
away
with
a
sense
of
gratitude
to
lady
horrocks
and
when
he
had
left
the
house
he
remembered
that
not
even
a
civil
formality
with
regard
to
sir
william
had
fallen
from
his
lips
but
sir
william
wife
for
whatever
reason
had
also
not
once
mentioned
the
baronet
name
only
a
few
days
passed
before
widdowson
received
the
summons
he
was
expecting
it
came
in
the
form
of
a
telegram
bidding
him
hasten
to
his
wife
not
a
word
of
news
added
at
the
time
of
its
arrival
he
was
taking
his
afternoon
walk
this
delay
made
it
doubtful
whether
he
could
get
to
paddington
by
the
last
train
which
would
enable
him
to
reach
clevedon
that
night
he
managed
it
with
only
two
or
three
minutes
to
spare
not
till
he
was
seated
in
the
railway
carriage
could
he
fix
his
thoughts
on
the
end
of
the
journey
an
inexpressible
repugnance
then
affected
him
he
would
have
welcomed
any
disaster
to
the
train
any
injury
which
might
prevent
his
going
to
monica
at
such
a
time
often
in
anticipation
the
event
which
was
now
come
to
pass
had
confused
and
darkened
his
mind
he
loathed
the
thought
of
it
if
the
child
perhaps
already
born
were
in
truth
his
it
must
be
very
long
before
he
could
regard
it
with
a
shadow
of
paternal
interest
uncertainty
to
which
he
was
condemned
would
in
all
likelihood
make
it
an
object
of
aversion
to
him
as
long
as
he
lived
he
was
at
bristol
by
a
quarter
past
nine
and
had
to
change
for
a
slow
train
which
by
ten
brought
him
to
yatton
the
little
junction
for
clevedon
it
was
a
fine
starry
night
but
extremely
cold
for
the
few
minutes
of
detention
he
walked
restlessly
about
the
platform
his
chief
emotion
was
now
a
fear
lest
all
might
not
go
well
with
monica
whether
he
could
believe
what
she
had
to
tell
him
or
not
it
would
be
worse
if
she
were
to
die
before
he
could
hear
her
exculpation
the
anguish
of
remorse
would
seize
upon
him
alone
in
his
compartment
he
did
not
sit
down
but
stamped
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
floor
and
before
the
train
stopped
he
jumped
out
no
cab
was
procurable
he
left
his
bag
at
the
station
and
hastened
with
all
speed
in
the
direction
that
he
remembered
but
very
soon
the
crossways
had
confused
him
as
he
met
no
one
whom
he
could
ask
to
direct
him
he
had
to
knock
at
a
door
streaming
with
perspiration
he
came
at
length
within
sight
of
his
own
house
a
church
clock
was
striking
eleven
alice
and
virginia
were
both
standing
in
the
hall
when
the
door
was
opened
they
beckoned
him
into
a
room
it
over
he
asked
staring
from
one
to
the
other
with
his
dazzled
eyes
four
this
afternoon
answered
alice
scarce
able
to
articulate
little
girl
had
to
have
chloroform
said
virginia
who
looked
a
miserable
lifeless
object
and
shook
like
one
in
an
ague
all
well
think
so
we
hope
so
they
stammered
together
alice
added
that
the
doctor
was
to
make
another
call
they
had
a
good
nurse
the
infant
seemed
healthy
but
was
a
very
very
little
mite
and
had
only
made
its
voice
heard
for
a
few
minutes
knows
you
sent
for
me
and
we
have
something
to
give
you
you
were
to
have
this
as
soon
as
you
arrived
miss
madden
handed
him
a
sealed
envelope
then
both
the
sisters
drew
away
as
if
fearing
the
result
of
what
they
had
done
widdowson
just
glanced
at
the
unaddressed
missive
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
must
have
something
to
eat
he
said
wiping
his
forehead
the
doctor
comes
i
see
him
this
visit
took
place
while
he
was
engaged
on
his
supper
on
coming
down
from
the
patient
the
doctor
gave
him
an
assurance
that
things
were
progressing
well
the
morning
probably
would
enable
him
to
speak
with
yet
more
confidence
widdowson
had
another
brief
conversation
with
the
sisters
then
bade
them
and
went
to
the
room
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
as
he
closed
the
door
he
heard
a
thin
faint
wail
and
stood
listening
until
it
ceased
it
came
from
a
room
on
the
floor
below
having
brought
himself
with
an
effort
to
open
the
envelope
he
had
received
he
found
several
sheets
of
notepaper
one
of
them
remarked
immediately
in
a
man
writing
at
this
he
first
glanced
and
the
beginning
showed
him
that
it
was
a
written
to
monica
he
threw
it
aside
and
took
up
the
other
sheets
which
contained
a
long
communication
from
his
wife
it
was
dated
two
months
ago
in
it
monica
recounted
to
him
with
scrupulous
truthfulness
the
whole
story
of
her
relations
with
bevis
only
make
this
confession
so
she
concluded
the
sake
of
the
poor
child
that
will
soon
be
born
the
child
is
yours
and
ought
not
to
suffer
because
of
what
i
did
the
enclosed
letter
will
prove
this
to
you
if
anything
can
for
myself
i
ask
nothing
i
do
think
i
shall
live
if
i
do
i
will
consent
to
anything
you
propose
i
only
ask
you
to
behave
without
any
pretence
if
you
can
not
forgive
me
do
not
make
a
show
of
it
say
what
your
will
is
and
that
shall
be
enough
he
did
not
go
to
bed
that
night
there
was
a
fire
in
the
room
and
he
kept
it
alight
until
daybreak
when
he
descended
softly
to
the
hall
and
let
himself
out
of
the
house
in
a
fierce
wind
that
swept
from
the
down
the
foaming
channel
he
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
careless
whither
the
roads
directed
him
all
he
desired
was
to
be
at
a
distance
from
that
house
with
its
hideous
silence
and
the
faint
cry
that
could
scarcely
be
called
a
sound
the
necessity
of
returning
of
spending
days
there
was
an
oppression
which
held
him
like
a
nightmare
monica
statement
he
neither
believed
nor
disbelieved
he
simply
could
not
make
up
his
mind
about
it
she
had
lied
to
him
so
resolutely
before
was
she
not
capable
of
elaborate
falsehood
to
save
her
reputation
and
protect
her
child
the
letter
from
bevis
might
have
been
a
result
of
conspiracy
between
them
that
bevis
was
the
man
against
whom
his
jealousy
should
have
been
directed
at
first
astounded
him
by
now
he
had
come
to
a
full
perception
of
his
stupidity
in
never
entertaining
such
a
thought
the
revelation
was
equivalent
to
a
second
offence
just
discovered
for
he
found
it
impossible
to
ignore
his
suspicion
of
barfoot
and
he
even
surmised
the
possibility
of
monica
having
listened
to
from
that
quarter
previously
to
her
intimacy
with
bevis
he
loathed
the
memory
of
his
life
since
marriage
and
as
for
pardoning
his
wife
he
could
as
soon
pardon
and
smile
upon
the
author
of
that
accursed
letter
from
bordeaux
but
go
back
to
the
house
he
must
by
obeying
his
impulse
and
straightway
returning
to
london
he
might
be
the
cause
of
a
fatal
turn
in
monica
illness
constraint
of
bare
humanity
would
keep
him
here
until
his
wife
was
out
of
danger
but
he
could
not
see
her
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
must
escape
from
such
unendurable
circumstances
at
eight
he
was
met
by
alice
who
seemed
to
have
slept
as
little
as
he
himself
had
done
they
went
into
the
has
been
inquiring
about
you
began
miss
madden
timorously
is
she
worse
i
believe
but
so
very
weak
she
wishes
me
to
ask
you
his
manner
did
not
encourage
the
poor
woman
shall
be
obliged
to
tell
her
something
if
i
have
nothing
to
say
she
will
fret
herself
into
a
dangerous
state
she
wants
to
know
if
you
have
read
her
letter
and
if
if
you
will
see
the
child
widdowson
turned
away
and
stood
irresolute
he
felt
miss
madden
hand
upon
his
arm
do
refuse
let
me
give
her
some
comfort
the
child
she
anxious
about
alice
admitted
it
looking
into
her
face
with
woeful
appeal
i
will
see
it
he
answered
have
it
brought
into
some
room
then
say
i
seen
it
i
take
her
a
word
of
forgiveness
say
i
forgive
her
she
does
wish
me
to
go
to
her
alice
shook
her
head
say
i
forgive
her
as
he
directed
so
it
was
done
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
miss
madden
brought
word
to
him
that
her
sister
had
experienced
great
relief
she
was
sleeping
but
the
doctor
thought
it
necessary
to
make
two
visits
before
nightfall
and
late
in
the
evening
he
came
again
he
explained
to
widdowson
that
there
were
complications
not
unlikely
to
be
dangerous
and
finally
he
suggested
that
if
the
morrow
brought
no
decided
improvement
a
second
medical
man
should
be
called
in
to
consult
this
consultation
was
held
in
the
afternoon
virginia
came
weeping
to
her
and
told
him
that
monica
was
delirious
that
night
the
whole
household
watched
another
day
was
passed
in
the
gravest
anxiety
and
at
dusk
the
medical
attendant
no
longer
disguised
his
opinion
that
widdowson
was
sinking
she
became
unconscious
soon
after
and
in
the
early
morning
breathed
her
last
widdowson
was
in
the
room
and
at
the
end
sat
by
the
bedside
for
an
hour
but
he
did
not
look
upon
his
wife
face
when
it
was
told
him
that
she
had
ceased
to
breathe
he
rose
and
went
into
his
own
chamber
but
tearless
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
monica
was
buried
in
the
cemetery
which
is
hard
by
the
old
church
widdowson
and
the
elder
sister
had
a
long
conversation
in
private
it
related
first
of
all
to
the
motherless
baby
widdowson
desire
was
that
miss
madden
should
undertake
the
care
of
the
child
she
and
virginia
might
live
wherever
they
preferred
their
needs
would
be
provided
for
alice
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
for
such
a
proposal
as
it
concerned
the
child
that
is
to
say
gladly
she
accepted
it
there
something
i
must
tell
you
she
said
with
embarrassed
appeal
in
her
wet
eyes
virginia
wishes
to
go
into
an
institution
widdowson
looked
at
her
not
understanding
whereupon
she
broke
into
tears
and
made
known
that
her
sister
was
such
a
slave
to
strong
drink
that
they
both
despaired
of
reformation
unless
by
help
of
the
measure
she
had
indicated
there
were
people
she
had
heard
who
undertook
the
care
of
inebriates
know
that
we
are
by
no
means
penniless
sobbed
alice
can
very
well
bear
the
expense
but
will
you
assist
us
to
find
a
suitable
place
he
promised
to
proceed
at
once
in
the
matter
when
she
is
cured
said
miss
madden
shall
come
and
live
with
me
and
when
baby
is
about
two
years
old
we
will
do
what
we
have
been
purposing
for
a
long
time
we
will
open
a
school
for
young
children
either
here
or
at
weston
that
will
afford
my
poor
sister
occupation
indeed
we
shall
both
be
better
for
the
exertion
of
such
an
undertaking
do
you
think
so
would
be
a
wise
thing
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
the
large
house
was
to
be
abandoned
and
as
much
of
the
furniture
as
seemed
needful
transported
to
a
smaller
dwelling
in
another
part
of
clevedon
for
alice
resolved
to
stay
here
in
spite
of
painful
associations
she
loved
the
place
and
looked
forward
with
quiet
joy
to
the
life
that
was
prepared
for
her
widdowson
books
would
go
back
to
london
not
to
the
hampstead
lodgings
however
fearful
of
solitude
he
proposed
to
his
friend
newdick
that
they
should
live
together
he
as
a
man
of
substance
bearing
the
larger
share
of
the
expense
and
this
plan
also
came
into
execution
three
months
went
by
and
on
a
day
of
summer
when
the
wooded
hills
and
green
lanes
and
rich
meadows
of
clevedon
looked
their
best
when
the
channel
was
still
and
blue
and
the
welsh
mountains
loomed
through
a
sunny
haze
rhoda
nunn
came
over
from
the
mendips
to
see
miss
madden
it
could
not
be
a
gladsome
meeting
but
rhoda
was
bright
and
natural
and
her
talk
as
inspiriting
as
ever
she
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
walked
about
with
it
for
a
long
time
in
the
garden
often
murmuring
little
child
dear
little
child
there
had
been
doubt
whether
it
would
live
but
the
summer
seemed
to
be
fortifying
its
health
alice
it
was
plain
had
found
her
vocation
she
looked
better
than
at
any
time
since
rhoda
had
known
her
her
complexion
was
losing
its
muddiness
and
spottiness
her
step
had
become
light
and
brisk
where
is
your
sister
inquired
miss
nunn
with
friends
at
present
she
will
be
back
before
long
i
hope
and
as
soon
as
baby
can
walk
we
are
going
to
think
very
seriously
about
the
school
you
remember
school
you
will
really
make
the
attempt
will
be
so
good
for
us
both
why
look
she
added
laughingly
is
one
pupil
growing
for
us
a
brave
woman
of
her
said
rhoda
kindly
will
try
ah
we
will
try
and
is
your
work
as
successful
as
ever
replied
rhoda
flourish
like
the
green
we
shall
have
to
take
larger
premises
you
must
read
the
paper
we
are
going
to
publish
the
first
number
will
be
out
in
a
month
though
the
name
is
quite
decided
upon
yet
miss
barfoot
was
never
in
such
health
and
spirit
nor
i
myself
the
world
is
moving
whilst
miss
madden
went
into
the
house

hospitalities
rhoda
still
nursing
sat
down
on
a
garden
bench
she
gazed
intently
at
those
diminutive
features
which
were
quite
placid
and
relaxing
in
soft
drowsiness
the
dark
bright
eye
was
monica
and
as
the
baby
sank
into
sleep
rhoda
vision
grew
dim
a
sigh
made
her
lips
quiver
and
once
more
she
murmured
little
child
