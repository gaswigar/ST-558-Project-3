i
adieu
to
the
united
states
one
wintry
night
i
bade
my
few
journalistic
friends
adieu
and
accompanied
by
my
mother
started
on
my
way
to
mexico
only
a
few
months
previous
i
had
become
a
newspaper
woman
i
was
too
impatient
to
work
along
at
the
usual
duties
assigned
women
on
newspapers
so
i
conceived
the
idea
of
going
away
as
a
correspondent
three
days
after
leaving
pittsburgh
we
awoke
one
morning
to
find
ourselves
in
the
lap
of
summer
for
a
moment
it
seemed
a
dream
when
the
porter
had
made
up
our
bunks
the
evening
previous
the
surrounding
country
had
been
covered
with
a
snowy
blanket
when
we
awoke
the
trees
were
in
leaf
and
the
balmy
breeze
mocked
our
wraps
three
days
from
dawn
until
dark
we
sat
at
the
end
of
the
car
inhaling
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
and
enjoying
the
glorious
western
sights
so
rich
in
originality
for
the
first
time
i
saw
women
plowing
while
their
lords
and
masters
sat
on
a
fence
smoking
i
never
longed
for
anything
so
much
as
i
did
to
shove
those
lazy
fellows
off
after
we
got
further
south
they
had
no
fences
i
was
glad
of
it
because
they
do
not
look
well
ornamented
with
lazy
men
the
land
was
so
beautiful
we
gazed
in
wonder
on
the
which
looked
when
moved
by
the
breezes
like
huge
foaming
breakers
in
their
mad
rush
for
the
shore
and
the
cowboys
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
real
live
cowboy
i
saw
on
the
plains
the
train
was
moving
at
a
pace
as
we
came
up
to
two
horsemen
they
wore
immense
sombreros
huge
spurs
and
had
lassos
hanging
to
the
side
of
their
saddles
i
knew
they
were
cowboys
so
jerking
off
a
red
scarf
i
waved
it
to
them
i
was
not
quite
sure
how
they
would
respond
from
the
thrilling
and
wicked
stories
i
had
read
i
fancied
they
might
begin
shooting
at
me
as
quickly
as
anything
else
however
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
them
lift
their
sombreros
in
a
manner
not
excelled
by
a
new
york
exquisite
and
urge
their
horses
into
a
mad
run
after
us
such
a
ride
the
feet
of
the
horses
never
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
by
this
time
nearly
all
the
passengers
were
watching
the
race
between
horse
and
steam
at
last
we
gradually
left
them
behind
i
waved
my
scarf
sadly
in
farewell
and
they
responded
with
their
sombreros
i
never
felt
as
much
reluctance
for
leaving
a
man
behind
as
i
did
to
leave
those
cowboys
the
people
at
the
different
looked
at
us
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
we
gazed
on
them
they
were
not
in
the
least
backward
about
asking
questions
or
making
remarks
one
woman
came
up
to
me
with
a
smile
and
said
missis
and
why
are
you
sittin
out
thar
when
thar
is
such
a
nice
cabin
to
be
in
she
could
not
understand
how
i
could
prefer
seeing
the
country
to
sitting
in
a
pullman
i
had
imagined
that
the
west
was
a
land
of
beef
and
cream
i
soon
learned
my
mistake
much
to
my
dismay
it
was
almost
an
impossibility
to
get
aught
else
than
salt
meat
and
cream
was
like
the
stars
out
of
reach
it
was
with
regret
we
learned
just
before
retiring
on
the
evening
of
our
third
day
out
from
louis
that
morning
would
find
us
in
el
paso
i
can
not
say
what
hour
it
was
when
the
porter
called
us
to
dress
that
the
train
would
soon
reach
its
destination
how
i
did
wish
i
had
remained
at
home
as
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
dress
on
my
knees
in
the
berth
it
so
dark
said
my
mother
as
she
parted
the
curtains
what
shall
we
do
when
we
arrive
well
i
glad
it
dark
because
i
wo
have
to
button
my
boots
or
comb
my
hair
i
replied
laughing
to
cheer
her
up
i
did
not
feel
as
cheerful
as
i
talked
when
we
left
the
train
it
had
been
our
home
for
three
days
and
now
we
were
cast
forth
in
a
strange
city
in
the
dark
the
train
employ√©s
were
running
about
with
their
lanterns
on
their
arms
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
drowsy
passengers
there
were
no
cabs
or
cabmen
or
even
wheelbarrows
around
and
the
darkness
prevented
us
from
getting
a
view
of
our
surroundings
this
has
taught
me
a
lesson
i
shall
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
first
man
who
mentions
marry
to
me
i
said
to
my
mother
as
we
wended
our
way
through
freight
and
baggage
to
the
then
i
will
have
some
one
to
look
after
me
she
looked
at
me
with
a
little
doubting
smile
and
gave
my
arm
a
reassuring
pressure
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
of
that
men
women
and
children
dogs
and
baggage
in
one
promiscuous
mass
the
dim
light
of
an
fell
with
dreary
effect
on
the
scene
some
were
sleeping
lost
for
awhile
to
all
the
cares
of
life
some
were
eating
some
were
smoking
and
a
group
of
men
were
passing
around
a
bottle
occasionally
as
they
dealt
out
a
greasy
pack
of
cards
it
was
evident
that
we
could
not
wait
the
glimpse
of
dawn
these
surroundings
with
my
mother
arm
still
tightly
clasped
in
mine
we
again
sought
the
outer
darkness
i
saw
a
man
with
a
lantern
on
his
arm
and
went
to
him
and
asked
directions
to
a
hotel
he
replied
that
they
were
all
closed
at
this
hour
but
if
i
could
be
satisfied
with
a
house
he
would
conduct
us
to
where
he
lived
we
were
only
too
glad
for
any
shelter
so
without
one
thought
of
where
he
might
take
us
we
followed
the
light
of
his
lantern
as
he
went
ahead
it
was
only
a
short
walk
through
the
sandy
streets
to
the
place
there
was
one
room
unoccupied
and
we
gladly
paid
for
it
and
by
the
aid
of
a
tallow
candle
found
our
way
to
bed
chapter
ii
el
paso
del
norte
my
dear
child
do
you
feel
rested
enough
i
heard
my
mother
ask
are
you
up
already
i
asked
turning
on
my
side
to
see
her
as
she
sat
dressed
by
the
open
window
through
which
came
a
lazy
southern
breeze
this
hour
she
replied
smiling
at
me
you
slept
so
well
i
did
not
want
to
rouse
you
but
the
morning
is
perfect
and
i
want
you
to
share
its
beauties
with
me
the
remembrance
of
our
midnight
arrival
faded
like
a
bad
nightmare
and
i
was
soon
happy
that
i
was
there
only
at
mealtime
did
i
long
for
home
we
learned
that
the
first
train
we
could
get
for
mexico
would
be
about
six
in
the
afternoon
so
we
decided
to
do
the
town
in
the
meanwhile
el
paso
which
is
spanish
for
the
pass
is
rather
a
lively
town
it
has
been
foretold
that
it
will
be
a
second
denver
so
rapid
is
its
growth
a
number
of
different
railway
lines
center
here
and
the
hotels
are
filled
the
year
round
with
health
and
pleasure
seekers
of
all
descriptions
while
it
is
always
warm
yet
its
climate
is
so
perfect
that
it
benefits
almost
any
sufferer
the
hotels
are
quite
modern
both
in
finish
and
price
and
the
on
a
par
with
those
in
the
east
the
prices
for
everything
are
something
dreadful
to
contemplate
the
houses
are
mostly
modern
with
here
and
there
the
adobe
huts
which
once
marked
this
border
the
courthouse
and
jail
combined
is
a
fine
brick
structure
that
any
large
city
might
boast
of
several
very
pretty
little
gardens
brighten
up
the
town
with
their
green
velvety
grasses
and
tropical
plants
and
trees
the
only
objection
i
found
to
el
paso
was
its
utter
lack
of
grass
the
people
of
position
are
mainly
those
who
are
there
for
their
health
or
to
enjoy
the
winter
in
the
balmy
climate
or
the
families
of
men
who
own
ranches
in
texas
the
chief
pleasure
is
driving
and
riding
and
the
display
during
the
driving
hour
would
put
to
shame
many
eastern
cities
the
citizens
are
perfectly
free
they
speak
and
do
and
think
as
they
please
in
our
walks
around
we
had
many
proffer
us
information
and
even
ask
permission
to
escort
us
to
points
of
interest
a
woman
offered
to
show
us
a
place
where
we
could
get
good
food
and
when
she
learned
that
we
were
leaving
that
evening
for
the
city
of
mexico
she
urged
us
to
get
a
basket
of
food
she
said
no
were
run
on
that
trip
and
the
eating
gotten
along
the
way
would
be
worse
than
americans
could
endure
we
afterward
felt
thankful
that
we
followed
her
advice
el
paso
the
american
town
and
el
paso
del
norte
the
pass
to
the
north
the
mexican
town
are
separated
as
new
york
from
brooklyn
as
pittsburgh
from
allegheny
the
rio
grande
running
swiftly
between
its
low
banks
its
waves
muddy
and
angry
or
sometimes
so
low
and
still
that
one
would
think
it
had
fallen
asleep
from
too
long
duty
divides
the
two
towns
communication
is
open
between
them
by
a
ferryboat
which
will
carry
you
across
for
two
and
one
half
cents
by
hack
buggies
and
saddle
horses
by
the
mexican
central
railway
which
transports
its
passengers
from
one
town
to
the
other
and
a
line
the
only
international
line
in
the
world
for
which
it
has
to
thank
texas
capitalists
it
is
not
possible
to
find
a
greater
contrast
than
these
two
cities
form
side
by
side
el
paso
is
a
progressive
lively
american
town
el
paso
del
norte
is
as
far
back
in
the
middle
ages
and
as
slow
as
it
was
when
the
first
adobe
hut
was
executed
in
it
is
rich
with
grass
and
shade
trees
while
el
paso
is
as
spare
of
grass
as
a
old
youth
is
of
beard
on
that
side
they
raise
the
finest
grapes
and
sell
the
most
exquisite
wine
that
ever
passed
mortals
lips
on
this
side
they
raise
vegetables
and
smuggle
the
wine
over
the
tobacco
is
pronounced
unequaled
and
the
american
pockets
will
carry
a
good
deal
every
trip
but
the
mexican
is
just
as
smart
in
paying
visits
and
carrying
back
what
can
be
only
gotten
at
double
the
price
on
his
side
but
the
mexican
officials
are
the
least
exacting
in
the
world
and
contrast
as
markedly
with
the
united
states
officials
as
the
two
towns
do
one
to
the
other
one
of
the
special
attractions
of
el
paso
del
norte
barring
the
tobacco
and
wine
is
a
queer
old
stone
church
which
is
said
to
be
nearly
years
old
it
is
low
and
dark
and
filled
with
peculiar
paintings
and
funnily
dressed
images
the
old
town
seems
to
look
with
proud
contempt
on
civilization
and
progress
and
the
little
preaches
against
free
schools
and
tells
his
poor
ignorant
followers
to
beware
of
the
hurry
and
worry
of
the
americans
to
live
as
their
and
did
so
in
obedience
they
keep
on
praying
and
attending
mass
sleeping
smoking
their
cigarettes
and
eating
beans
lazily
wondering
why
americans
can
not
learn
their
wise
way
of
enjoying
life
one
can
hardly
believe
that
americanism
is
separated
from
them
only
by
a
stream
if
they
were
thousands
of
miles
apart
they
could
not
be
more
unlike
there
smallpox
holds
undisputed
sway
in
the
dirty
streets
and
in
the
name
of
religion
vaccination
is
denounced
there
mexican
are
flogged
until
the
american
heart
burns
to
wipe
out
the
whole
colony
there
and
sundays
are
celebrated
by
the
most
inhuman
and
and
monte
games
of
all
descriptions
the
celebrated
on
the
border
are
the
most
inhuman
i
have
seen
in
all
of
mexico
the
horns
of
the
bulls
are
sawed
off
so
that
they
are
sensitive
and
can
make
but
little
attempt
at
defense
which
is
attended
with
extreme
pain
they
are
tortured
until
sinking
from
pain
and
fatigue
they
are
dispatched
by
the
butcher
el
paso
del
norte
boasts
of
a
real
mexican
prison
it
is
a
long
adobe
building
situated
quite
handy
to
the
main
plaza
and
within
hearing
of
the
of
the
town
there
are
no
cells
but
a
few
adobe
rooms
and
a
long
court
where
the
prisoners
talk
together
and
with
the
guards
and
count
the
time
as
it
laggingly
slips
away
they
very
often
play
cards
and
smoke
cigarettes
around
this
prison
is
a
line
of
soldiers
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
cross
it
without
detection
mexican
keepers
are
not
at
all
particular
that
the
prisoners
are
fed
every
day
an
american
at
the
hands
of
the
mexican
authorities
suffers
all
the
tortures
that
some
preachers
delight
to
tell
us
some
human
beings
will
find
in
the
world
to
come
fire
and
brimstone
it
is
nothing
to
the
torments
of
an
american
prisoner
in
a
mexican
jail
two
meals
not
enough
to
sustain
life
in
a
sick
cat
must
suffice
him
for
an
entire
week
there
are
no
beds
and
not
even
water
prisoners
also
have
the
not
very
comfortable
knowledge
that
if
they
get
too
troublesome
the
keepers
have
a
nasty
habit
of
making
them
stand
up
and
be
shot
in
the
back
the
reports
made
out
in
these
cases
are
shot
while
trying
to
escape
in
the
afternoon
i
exchanged
my
money
for
mexican
coin
getting
a
premium
of
twelve
cents
on
every
dollar
i
had
a
lunch
prepared
and
as
the
shades
of
night
began
to
envelop
the
town
we
boarded
the
train
for
mexico
after
we
crossed
the
rio
grande
our
baggage
was
examined
by
the
officers
while
we
ate
supper
at
a
restaurant
which
strangely
enough
was
run
by
chinamen
this
gave
us
a
foretaste
of
mexican
food
and
price
it
was
totally
dark
when
we
entered
the
car
again
and
we
were
quite
ready
to
retire
there
were
but
two
other
passengers
in
the
car
with
us
one
was
a
mexican
and
the
other
a
young
man
from
chicago
we
soon
bade
them
and
retired
to
our
berths
to
sleep
while
the
train
bore
us
swiftly
through
the
darkness
to
our
destination
chapter
iii
along
the
route
thirty
minutes
to
dress
for
breakfast
was
our
in
mexico
we
had
fallen
asleep
the
night
previous
as
easily
as
a
babe
in
its
crib
with
an
eager
anticipation
of
the
morrow
almost
before
the
pullman
porter
had
ceased
his
calling
our
window
shades
were
hoisted
and
we
were
trying
to
see
all
of
mexico
at
one
glance
that
glance
brought
disappointment
the
land
almost
as
far
as
the
eye
could
carry
which
is
a
wonderful
distance
in
the
clear
atmosphere
of
mexico
was
perfectly
level
barring
the
cacti
with
which
the
country
abounds
the
ground
was
bare
and
this
is
sunny
mexico
the
land
of
the
gods
i
exclaimed
in
disgust
by
the
time
we
had
completed
our
toilet
the
train
stopped
and
we
were
told
to
got
off
if
we
wanted
any
breakfast
we
followed
our
porter
to
a
side
track
where
in
an
old
freight
car
was
breakfast
we
climbed
up
the
high
steps
paying
our
dollar
as
we
entered
and
found
for
ourselves
places
at
the
long
table
it
was
surrounded
by
hungry
people
intent
only
on
helping
themselves
everything
was
on
the
table
even
to
the
coffee
i
made
an
effort
to
eat
it
was
impossible
my
mother
succeeded
no
better
are
you
not
glad
we
brought
a
lunch
she
asked
as
her
eyes
met
mine
we
went
back
to
the
car
and
managed
to
make
a
tolerable
breakfast
on
the
cold
chicken
and
other
eatables
we
found
in
our
basket
but
the
weather
it
was
simply
perfect
and
we
soon
forgot
little
annoyances
in
our
enjoyment
of
it
we
got
camp
chairs
and
from
morning
until
night
we
occupied
the
rear
platform
as
we
got
further
south
the
land
grew
more
interesting
we
gazed
in
wonder
at
the
groves
of
cacti
which
raised
their
heads
many
feet
in
the
air
and
topped
them
off
with
one
of
the
most
exquisite
blossoms
i
have
ever
seen
at
every
station
we
obtained
views
of
the
mexicans
as
the
train
drew
in
the
natives
of
whom
the
majority
still
retain
the
fashion
of
adam
minus
fig
leaves
would
rush
up
and
gaze
on
the
travelers
in
breathless
wonder
and
continue
to
look
after
the
train
as
if
it
was
the
one
event
of
their
lives
as
we
came
to
larger
towns
we
could
see
armed
horsemen
riding
at
a
speed
leaving
a
cloud
of
dust
in
their
wake
to
the
stations
when
the
train
stopped
they
formed
in
a
decorous
line
before
it
and
so
remained
until
the
train
started
again
on
its
journey
i
learned
that
they
were
a
government
guard
they
do
this
so
if
there
is
any
trouble
on
the
train
or
any
raised
at
the
station
during
their
stop
they
could
quell
it
hucksters
and
beggars
constitute
most
of
the
crowd
that
welcomes
the
train
from
the
former
we
bought
flowers
native
fruit
eggs
goat
milk
and
strange
mexican
food
the
pear
cacti
which
is
nursed
in
greenhouses
in
the
states
grows
wild
on
the
plains
to
a
height
of
twenty
feet
and
its
great
green
lobes
or
leaves
covered
thickly
with
thorns
are
frequently
three
feet
in
diameter
some
kinds
bear
a
fruit
and
others
yellow
when
gathered
they
are
in
a
thorny
shell
the
mexican
indians
gather
them
and
peel
them
and
sell
them
to
travelers
for
six
cents
a
dozen
it
is
called
tuna
and
is
considered
very
healthy
it
has
a
very
cool
and
pleasing
taste
from
this
or
cacti
the
mexicans
make
their
beer
which
they
call
pronounced
polke
it
is
also
used
by
the
natives
to
fence
in
their
mud
houses
and
forms
a
most
picturesque
and
impassable
surrounding
the
indians
seem
cleanly
enough
despite
all
that
been
said
to
the
contrary
along
the
gutters
by
the
railroad
they
could
be
seen
washing
their
few
bits
of
wearing
apparel
and
bathing
many
of
their
homes
are
but
holes
in
the
ground
with
a
straw
roof
the
smoke
creeps
out
from
the
doorway
all
day
and
at
night
the
family
sleep
in
the
ashes
they
seldom
lie
down
but
sleep
sitting
up
like
a
tailor
strange
to
say
but
they
never
nod
nor
fall
over
the
whirlwinds
or
sand
spouts
form
very
pretty
pictures
on
the
barren
plain
they
run
to
the
height
of
one
thousand
feet
and
travel
along
the
road
at
a
gait
going
up
the
mountain
side
as
majestic
as
a
queen
but
then
their
race
is
run
for
the
moment
they
begin
to
descend
their
spell
is
broken
and
they
fall
to
earth
again
to
become
only
common
sand
and
be
trod
by
the
bare
brown
feet
of
the
indian
and
the
dainty
hoofs
of
the
burro
some
one
told
me
that
when
a
man
sees
a
sand
spout
advancing
and
he
does
not
want
to
be
cornered
by
it
he
shoots
into
it
and
it
immediately
falls
i
ca
say
how
true
it
is
but
it
seems
very
probable
we
had
not
many
passengers
but
what
we
had
excepting
my
mother
and
myself
were
all
men
they
all
carried
among
them
was
one
young
mexican
gentleman
who
had
spent
several
years
in
europe
where
he
had
studied
the
english
language
he
was
very
attentive
to
us
and
taught
me
a
good
deal
of
spanish
he
had
been
away
long
enough
to
learn
that
the
mexicans
had
very
strange
ideas
and
he
quite
enjoyed
telling
incidents
about
them
when
the
mexican
railway
was
being
built
he
said
wheelbarrows
were
imported
for
the
native
laborers
they
had
never
seen
the
like
before
so
they
filled
them
with
earth
and
putting
them
on
their
backs
walked
off
to
the
place
of
deposit
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
be
made
to
understand
how
to
use
them
and
even
then
as
the
mexicans
are
very
weak
in
the
arms
little
work
could
be
accomplished
with
them
you
would
hardly
believe
it
he
continued
but
at
first
the
trains
were
regarded
as
the
devil
and
the
passengers
as
his
workers
once
a
settlement
of
natives
decided
to
overpower
the
devil
they
took
one
of
their
most
sacred
and
powerful
saints
and
placed
it
in
the
center
of
the
track
on
their
knees
with
great
faith
they
watched
the
advance
of
the
train
feeling
sure
the
saint
would
cause
it
to
stop
forever
in
its
endless
course
the
engineer
who
had
not
much
reverence
for
that
particular
saint
or
saints
in
general
struck
it
with
full
force
that
saint
reign
was
ended
since
then
they
are
allowed
to
remain
in
their
accustomed
nooks
in
the
churches
while
the
natives
still
have
the
same
faith
in
their
powers
but
are
not
anxious
to
test
them
come
i
want
you
to
see
the
strangest
mountain
in
the
world
interrupted
the
conductor
at
this
moment
we
followed
him
to
the
rear
platform
and
there
looked
curiously
at
the
mountain
he
pointed
out
it
rose
clear
and
alone
from
the
barren
plains
like
a
nose
on
one
face
it
seemed
to
be
of
brown
earth
but
it
contained
not
the
least
sign
of
vegetation
it
looked
as
high
as
the
brooklyn
bridge
from
the
water
to
top
and
was
about
the
same
length
in
an
oblong
shape
it
was
perfectly
straight
across
the
top
when
this
railroad
was
being
built
he
explained
i
went
with
a
party
of
engineers
in
search
of
something
new
through
curiosity
alone
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
land
we
decided
to
climb
that
strange
looking
mountain
from
here
you
can
not
see
the
vegetation
but
it
is
covered
with
a
low
brown
shrub
can
you
imagine
our
surprise
when
we
got
to
the
top
to
find
it
was
a
mammoth
basin
yes
that
hill
holds
in
it
the
most
beautiful
lake
i
ever
saw
that
seems
most
wonderful
i
exclaimed
rather
dubiously
it
is
not
more
wonderful
than
thousands
of
other
places
in
mexico
he
replied
in
the
state
of
chihuahua
is
a
laguna
in
which
the
water
is
as
clear
as
crystal
when
the
americans
who
were
superintending
the
work
on
the
railway
found
it
they
decided
to
have
a
nice
bath
it
had
been
many
days
since
they
had
seen
any
more
water
than
would
quench
their
thirst
in
coffee
of
course
accordingly
some
dozen
or
more
doffed
their
clothing
and
went
in
their
pleasure
was
for
their
bodies
began
to
burn
and
smart
and
they
came
out
looking
like
scalding
pigs
the
water
is
strongly
alkaline
the
fish
in
the
lake
are
said
to
be
white
even
to
their
eyes
they
are
unfit
to
eat
i
give
his
stories
for
what
they
are
worth
i
did
not
investigate
to
prove
their
truth
we
do
not
think
much
of
the
people
who
come
here
to
write
us
up
the
conductor
said
one
day
for
they
never
tell
the
truth
one
woman
who
came
down
here
to
make
herself
famous
pressed
me
one
day
for
a
story
i
told
her
that
out
in
the
country
the
natives
roasted
whole
hogs
heads
and
all
without
cleaning
and
so
served
them
on
the
table
she
jotted
it
down
as
a
rare
item
if
you
tell
strangers
untruths
about
your
own
land
can
you
complain
then
that
the
same
strangers
misrepresent
it
asked
my
little
mother
quietly
the
conductor
flushed
and
said
he
had
not
thought
of
it
in
that
light
before
while
yet
a
day
travel
distant
from
the
city
of
mexico
tomatoes
and
strawberries
were
procurable
it
was
january
the
venders
were
quite
up
to
the
tricks
of
the
hucksters
in
the
states
in
a
small
basket
they
place
cabbage
leaves
and
two
or
three
pebbles
to
give
weight
then
the
top
is
covered
with
strawberries
so
deftly
that
even
the
smartest
purchaser
thinks
he
is
getting
a
bargain
for
cents
at
larger
towns
a
change
for
the
better
was
noticeable
in
the
clothing
of
the
people
the
most
fashionable
dress
for
the
mexican
indian
was
white
muslin
panteloons
twice
as
wide
as
those
worn
by
the
dudes
last
summer
a
as
often
cotton
as
wool
wrapped
around
the
shoulders
a
straw
sombrero
and
sometimes
leather
sandals
bound
to
the
feet
with
leather
cords
the
women
wear
loose
sleeveless
waists
with
a
straight
piece
of
cloth
pinned
around
them
for
skirts
and
the
habitual
wrapped
about
the
head
and
holding
the
equally
habitual
baby
no
difference
how
cold
or
warm
the
day
nor
how
scant
the
lower
garments
the
and
are
never
laid
aside
and
none
seem
too
poor
to
own
one
apparently
the
natives
do
not
believe
much
in
standing
for
the
moment
they
stop
walking
they
hunker
down
on
the
ground
never
once
during
the
three
days
did
we
think
of
getting
tired
and
it
was
with
a
little
regret
mingled
with
a
desire
to
see
more
that
we
knew
when
we
awoke
in
the
morning
we
would
be
in
the
city
of
mexico
footnote
pronounced
chapter
iv
the
city
of
mexico
the
city
of
mexico
they
had
called
we
got
off
but
we
saw
no
city
we
soon
learned
that
the
train
did
not
go
further
and
that
we
would
have
to
take
a
carriage
to
convey
us
the
rest
of
the
way
carriages
lined
the
entrance
to
the
station
and
the
cab
men
were
apparently
from
their
actions
just
like
those
of
the
states
when
they
procure
a
permit
for
a
carriage
in
mexico
it
is
graded
and
marked
a
carriage
carries
a
white
flag
a
a
blue
flag
and
a
a
red
flag
the
prices
are
respectively
per
hour
one
dollar
cents
and
fifty
cents
this
is
meant
for
a
protection
to
travelers
but
the
drivers
are
very
cunning
often
at
night
they
will
remove
the
flag
and
charge
double
prices
but
they
can
be
punished
for
it
we
soon
arrived
at
the
hotel
yturbide
and
were
assigned
rooms
by
the
affable
clerk
the
hotel
was
once
the
home
of
the
emperor
yturbide
it
is
a
large
building
of
the
mexican
style
the
entrance
takes
one
into
a
large
open
court
or
square
all
the
rooms
are
arranged
around
this
court
opening
out
into
a
circle
of
balconies
the
lowest
floor
in
mexico
is
the
cheapest
the
higher
up
one
goes
the
higher
they
find
the
price
the
reason
of
this
is
that
at
the
top
one
escapes
any
possible
dampness
and
can
get
the
light
and
sun
our
room
had
a
red
brick
floor
it
was
large
but
had
no
ventilation
except
the
glass
doors
which
opened
onto
the
balcony
there
was
a
little
iron
cot
in
each
corner
of
the
room
a
table
washstand
and
wardrobe
it
all
looked
so
miserable
like
a
prisoner
cell
that
i
began
to
wish
i
was
at
home
at
dinner
we
had
quite
a
time
trying
to
understand
the
waiter
and
to
make
him
understand
us
the
food
we
thought
wretched
and
as
our
lunch
basket
was
long
since
emptied
we
felt
a
longing
for
some
united
states
eatables
i
found
we
could
not
learn
much
about
mexican
life
by
living
at
the
hotels
so
the
first
thing
was
to
find
some
one
who
could
speak
english
and
through
them
obtain
boarding
in
a
private
family
it
was
rather
difficult
but
i
succeeded
and
i
was
glad
to
exchange
quarters
the
city
of
mexico
makes
many
bright
promises
for
the
future
as
a
winter
resort
as
a
summer
resort
a
city
for
men
to
accumulate
fortunes
a
paradise
for
students
for
artists
a
rich
field
for
the
hunter
of
the
curious
the
beautiful
and
the
rare
its
bright
future
can
not
be
far
distant
already
its
wonders
are
related
to
the
enterprizing
people
of
other
climes
who
are
making
prospective
tours
through
the
land
that
held
cities
even
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
america
mexico
looks
the
same
all
over
every
white
street
terminates
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
look
which
way
you
will
the
streets
are
named
very
strangely
and
prove
quite
a
torment
to
strangers
every
block
or
square
is
named
separately
the
most
prominent
street
is
the
easiest
to
remember
and
even
it
is
peculiar
it
is
called
the
street
of
san
francisco
and
the
first
block
is
designated
as
first
san
francisco
the
second
as
second
san
francisco
and
so
on
the
entire
street
one
continually
sees
poverty
and
wealth
side
by
side
in
mexico
and
they
do
turn
up
their
noses
at
each
other
either
the
indian
has
as
much
room
on
the
fifth
avenue
of
mexico
as
the
millionaire
wife
not
but
what
that
land
as
this
bows
to
wealth
policemen
occupy
the
center
of
the
street
at
every
termination
of
a
block
reminding
one
as
they
look
down
the
streets
of
so
many
posts
they
wear
white
caps
with
numbers
on
blue
suits
and
nickel
buttons
a
mace
now
takes
the
place
of
the
sword
of
former
days
at
night
they
don
an
overcoat
and
hood
which
makes
them
look
just
like
the
pictures
of
veiled
knights
red
lanterns
are
left
in
the
street
where
the
policemen
stood
during
the
daytime
while
they
retire
to
some
doorway
where
it
is
said
they
sleep
as
soundly
as
their
brethren
in
the
states
every
hour
they
blow
a
whistle
like
those
used
by
street
car
drivers
which
is
answered
by
those
on
the
next
posts
thus
they
know
all
is
well
in
small
towns
they
call
out
the
time
of
night
ending
up
with
all
serene
from
which
the
mexican
youth
with
some
mischievous
yankeeism
have
named
them
chapter
in
the
streets
of
mexico
in
mexico
as
in
all
other
countries
the
average
tourist
rushes
to
the
cathedrals
and
places
of
historic
note
wholly
unmindful
of
the
most
intensely
interesting
feature
the
country
contains
the
people
street
scenes
in
the
city
of
mexico
form
a
brilliant
and
entertaining
panorama
for
which
no
charge
is
made
even
photographers
slight
this
wonderful
picture
if
you
ask
for
mexican
scenes
they
show
you
cathedrals
saints
cities
and
mountains
but
never
the
wonderful
things
that
are
right
under
their
eyes
daily
likewise
journalists
describe
this
cathedral
tell
you
the
age
of
that
one
paint
you
the
beauties
of
another
but
the
people
the
living
moving
masses
that
go
so
far
toward
making
the
population
of
mexico
are
passed
by
with
scarce
a
mention
it
is
not
a
clean
inviting
crowd
with
blue
eyes
and
sunny
hair
i
would
take
you
among
but
a
short
people
with
almost
black
skins
topped
off
with
the
blackest
eyes
and
masses
of
raven
hair
their
lives
are
as
dark
as
their
skins
and
hair
and
are
invaded
by
no
hope
that
through
effort
their
lives
may
amount
to
something
nine
women
out
of
ten
in
mexico
have
babies
when
at
a
very
tender
age
so
young
as
five
days
the
babies
are
completely
hidden
in
the
folds
of
the
and
strung
to
the
mother
back
in
close
proximity
to
the
mammoth
baskets
of
vegetables
on
her
head
and
suspended
on
either
side
of
the
human
freight
when
the
babies
get
older
their
heads
and
feet
appear
and
soon
they
give
their
place
to
another
or
share
their
quarters
as
it
is
no
unusual
sight
to
see
a
woman
carry
three
babies
at
one
time
in
her
they
are
always
good
their
little
eyes
gaze
out
on
what
is
to
be
their
world
in
solemn
wonder
no
baby
smiles
or
babyish
tears
are
ever
seen
on
their
faces
at
the
earliest
date
they
are
old
and
appear
to
view
life
just
as
it
is
to
them
in
all
its
blackness
they
know
no
home
they
have
no
school
and
before
they
are
able
to
talk
they
are
taught
to
carry
bundles
on
their
heads
or
backs
or
pack
a
younger
member
of
the
family
while
the
mother
carries
merchandise
by
which
she
gains
a
living
their
living
is
scarcely
worth
such
a
title
they
merely
exist
thousands
of
them
are
born
and
raised
on
the
streets
they
have
no
home
and
were
never
in
a
bed
going
along
the
streets
of
the
city
late
at
night
you
will
find
dark
groups
huddled
in
the
shadows
which
on
investigation
will
turn
out
to
be
whole
families
gone
to
bed
they
never
lie
down
but
sit
with
their
heads
on
their
knees
and
so
pass
the
night
when
they
get
hungry
they
seek
the
warm
side
of
the
street
and
there
hunkering
down
devour
what
they
scraped
up
during
the
day
consisting
of
refused
meats
and
offal
boiled
over
a
handful
of
charcoal
a
fresh
tortilla
is
the
sweetest
of
sweetbreads
the
men
appear
very
kind
and
are
frequently
to
be
seen
with
the
little
ones
tied
up
in
their
groups
of
these
at
dinner
would
furnish
rare
studies
for
rodgers
several
men
and
women
will
be
walking
along
when
suddenly
they
will
sit
down
in
some
sunny
spot
on
the
street
the
women
will
bring
fish
or
a
lot
of
stuff
out
of
a
basket
or
poke
which
is
to
constitute
their
coming
meal
meanwhile
the
men
who
also
sit
flat
on
the
street
will
be
looking
on
and
accepting
their
portion
like
hungry
but
dogs
this
type
of
life
be
it
understood
is
the
lowest
in
mexico
and
connects
in
no
way
with
the
upper
classes
the
mexicans
are
certainly
misrepresented
most
wrongfully
so
they
are
not
lazy
but
just
the
opposite
from
early
dawn
until
late
at
night
they
can
be
seen
filling
their
different
occupations
the
women
sell
papers
and
lottery
tickets
see
here
child
said
a
lottery
woman
in
spanish
buy
a
ticket
a
sure
chance
to
get
for
cents
being
told
that
we
had
no
faith
in
lotteries
she
replied
buy
one
the
blessed
virgin
will
bring
you
the
money
the
laundry
women
who
by
the
way
wash
clothes
whiter
and
iron
them
smoother
even
than
the
chinese
carry
the
clothes
home
unwrapped
that
is
they
carry
their
hands
high
above
their
head
from
which
stream
white
skirts
laces
furnishing
a
most
novel
and
interesting
sight
the
saddest
thing
i
ever
saw
said
theo
gestefeld
among
all
the
sad
things
in
mexico
was
an
incident
that
happened
when
i
first
arrived
here
noticing
a
policeman
talking
to
a
boy
around
whom
a
crowd
of
dusky
citizens
had
gathered
i
true
to
journalistic
instinct
went
up
to
investigate
the
boy
i
found
belonged
to
one
of
the
many
families
who
do
odd
jobs
in
day
time
for
a
little
food
and
sleep
at
night
in
some
dark
corner
strung
to
the
boy
back
was
a
dying
baby
its
little
eyes
were
half
closed
in
death
the
crowd
watched
in
breathless
fascination
its
last
slow
gasps
the
boy
had
no
home
to
go
to
he
knew
not
where
to
find
his
parents
at
that
hour
of
the
day
and
there
he
stood
while
the
babe
died
in
its
cradle
his
in
my
newspaper
career
i
have
witnessed
many
sad
scenes
but
i
never
saw
anything
so
heartrending
as
the
death
of
that
little
innocent
tortillas
is
not
only
one
of
the
great
mexican
dishes
but
one
of
the
women
chief
industries
in
almost
any
street
there
can
be
seen
women
on
their
knees
mashing
corn
between
smooth
stones
making
it
into
a
batter
and
finally
shaping
it
into
round
flat
cakes
they
spit
on
their
hands
to
keep
the
dough
from
sticking
and
bake
in
a
pan
of
hot
grease
kept
boiling
by
a
few
lumps
of
charcoal
rich
and
poor
buy
and
eat
them
apparently
unmindful
of
the
way
they
are
made
but
it
is
a
bread
that
americans
must
be
educated
to
many
surprise
the
mexicans
by
refusing
even
a
taste
after
they
see
the
bakers
there
are
some
really
beautiful
girls
among
this
low
class
of
people
hair
three
quarters
the
length
of
the
women
and
of
wonderful
thickness
is
common
it
is
often
worn
loose
but
more
frequently
in
two
long
plaits
wigmakers
find
no
employment
here
the
men
wear
long
heavy
bangs
there
is
but
one
thing
that
poor
and
rich
indulge
in
with
equal
delight
and
pleasure
that
is
cigarette
smoking
those
tottering
with
age
down
to
the
creeping
babe
are
continually
smoking
no
spot
in
mexico
is
sacred
from
them
in
churches
on
the
railway
cars
on
the
streets
in
the
theaters
everywhere
are
to
be
seen
men
and
women
of
the
smoking
the
mexicans
make
unsurpassed
servants
their
thievery
which
is
a
historic
complaint
must
be
confined
to
those
in
the
suburbs
for
those
in
houses
could
not
be
more
honest
there
cleanliness
is
something
overwhelming
when
one
recalls
the
tales
that
have
been
told
of
the
filth
of
the
greasers
early
in
the
mornings
the
streets
walks
in
the
plaza
and
pavements
are
swept
as
clean
as
anything
can
be
and
that
with
brooms
not
as
good
as
those
children
play
with
in
the
states
put
an
american
domestic
and
a
mexican
servant
together
even
with
the
difference
in
the
working
implements
and
the
american
will
get
left
every
time
but
this
cleanliness
may
be
confined
somewhat
to
such
work
as
sweeping
and
scrubbing
it
does
not
certainly
exist
in
the
preparation
of
food
pulque
which
is
sucked
from
the
mother
plant
into
a
man
mouth
and
thence
ejected
into
a
is
brought
to
town
in
the
skins
are
filled
and
then
tied
onto
burros
or
sometimes
not
frequently
carried
in
wagons
the
filled
skin
rolling
from
side
to
side
never
less
than
four
filled
skins
are
ever
loaded
onto
a
burro
oftener
eight
and
ten
the
burros
are
never
harnessed
but
go
along
in
trains
which
often
number
fifty
mexican
politeness
extends
even
among
the
lowest
classes
in
all
their
dealings
they
are
as
polite
as
a
dancing
master
the
moment
one
is
addressed
off
comes
his
poor
old
ragged
hat
and
he
stands
until
you
leave
him
they
are
not
only
polite
to
other
people
but
among
themselves
one
poor
ragged
woman
was
trying
to
sell
a
broken
knife
and
rusty
lock
at
a
pawnbroker
stand
will
you
buy
she
asked
plaintively
no
senora
i
thank
you
was
the
polite
reply
the
police
are
not
to
be
excelled
when
necessary
to
clear
a
hall
of
an
immense
crowd
not
a
rough
word
is
spoken
it
is
not
get
out
of
this
now
get
out
of
here
and
rough
and
tumble
push
and
rush
as
it
is
in
the
states
among
the
civilized
people
with
raised
cap
and
low
voice
the
officer
gently
says
in
spanish
gentlemen
it
is
not
my
will
but
it
is
time
to
close
the
door
ladies
allow
me
the
honor
to
accompany
you
toward
the
door
in
a
very
few
moments
the
hall
is
empty
without
noise
without
trouble
just
with
a
few
polite
words
among
people
who
can
not
read
who
wear
knives
in
their
boots
if
they
have
any
and
carry
immense
revolvers
strung
to
their
belts
people
who
have
been
trained
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
blood
to
be
bloodthirsty
what
a
marked
contrast
to
the
educated
cultured
inhabitants
of
the
states
beneath
all
this
ignorance
there
is
a
heart
as
sympathetic
in
its
way
as
that
of
any
educated
man
it
is
no
unusual
sight
to
see
a
man
walk
along
with
a
coffin
on
his
head
from
which
is
visible
the
remains
of
some
child
in
an
instant
all
the
men
in
the
gutters
on
the
walks
or
in
the
doorways
have
their
hats
off
and
remain
until
the
sad
procession
is
far
away
the
if
such
he
may
be
called
dodges
in
and
out
among
the
carriages
burros
and
wagons
which
fill
the
street
the
drivers
lift
their
hats
but
the
silent
bearer
generally
the
father
moves
along
unmindful
of
all
funeral
cars
meet
with
the
same
respect
in
passing
along
where
a
new
building
was
being
erected
attention
was
attracted
to
the
body
of
a
laborer
who
had
fallen
from
the
building
a
white
cloth
covered
all
of
the
body
except
his
sandaled
feet
the
virgin
rest
his
soul
virgin
mother
grant
him
grace
were
the
prayers
of
his
kind
as
the
policeman
commanded
his
body
to
be
carried
away
these
little
scenes
prove
they
are
not
brutes
that
they
are
a
little
better
than
some
intelligent
people
would
have
you
believe
the
meat
express
does
not
by
any
means
serve
to
make
the
meat
more
palatable
generally
an
old
mule
or
horse
that
has
reached
its
second
childhood
serves
for
the
express
a
long
iron
rod
from
which
hooks
project
is
fastened
on
the
back
of
the
beast
by
means
of
straps
the
meat
is
hung
on
these
hooks
where
it
is
exposed
to
the
mud
and
dirt
of
the
streets
as
well
as
the
hair
of
the
animal
men
with
two
large
baskets
one
in
front
one
behind
filled
with
the
refuse
of
meat
follow
near
by
if
they
wear
trousers
they
have
them
rolled
up
high
so
the
blood
from
the
dripping
meat
will
not
soil
them
but
run
down
their
bare
legs
and
be
absorbed
in
the
sand
it
is
asserted
that
the
poor
do
not
allow
this
mixture
in
the
basket
to
go
to
waste
but
are
as
glad
to
get
it
as
we
are
to
get
sirloin
steak
men
with
cages
of
fowls
baskets
of
eggs
and
bushels
of
roots
and
charcoal
come
from
the
mountain
in
droves
of
from
to
fifty
carrying
packs
which
average
three
hundred
pounds
one
form
of
politeness
here
is
that
when
complimenting
or
observing
anything
that
belongs
to
a
native
they
will
reply
it
is
yours
that
it
means
nothing
but
politeness
some
are
slow
to
learn
my
house
is
yours
you
have
but
to
command
me
said
the
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
but
he
made
no
move
to
vacate
a
greeny
from
the
states
who
was
working
for
the
mexican
central
tested
some
beer
that
was
on
its
way
to
the
city
that
is
good
beer
he
remarked
to
the
express
man
senor
it
is
yours
was
the
reply
green
was
elated
and
trudged
off
home
with
the
keg
much
to
the
consternation
and
distress
of
the
poor
express
man
who
was
compelled
to
pay
out
of
his
own
purse
for
his
politeness
you
have
very
handsome
coffins
was
remarked
to
a
man
who
probably
judging
from
our
looks
since
we
had
struck
mexican
diet
thought
he
had
found
a
customer
and
had
insisted
on
showing
every
coffin
in
the
house
even
to
the
handles
plates
and
linings
senorita
they
are
yours
thinking
they
would
be
an
unwelcome
elephant
on
our
hands
we
replied
with
thanks
and
made
our
exit
as
quickly
as
possible
a
young
spanish
gentleman
who
doubtless
was
employed
by
the
express
company
said
after
a
few
moments
conversation
the
express
company
and
myself
are
yours
we
confess
to
the
stupidity
of
not
accepting
the
bonanza
with
him
included
a
peep
into
doorways
shows
the
people
at
all
manner
of
occupations
men
always
use
the
machines
women
and
men
put
chairs
together
and
weave
bottoms
in
them
they
also
make
shoes
the
finest
and
most
artistic
shoe
in
the
world
and
the
cobblers
can
make
a
good
shoe
out
of
one
that
is
so
badly
worn
as
to
be
useless
to
our
grandmothers
as
a
rod
of
correction
the
is
one
of
the
most
common
objects
on
the
street
they
suspend
from
their
heads
one
in
front
one
back
around
their
bodies
are
leather
aprons
to
protect
them
from
the
water
which
they
get
at
big
fountains
and
basins
distributed
throughout
the
city
as
a
people
they
do
not
seem
malicious
quarrelsome
unkind
or
drunkenness
does
not
seem
to
be
frequent
and
the
men
in
their
uncouth
way
are
more
thoughtful
of
the
women
than
many
who
belong
to
a
higher
class
the
women
like
other
women
sometimes
cry
doubtless
for
very
good
cause
and
then
the
men
stop
to
console
them
patting
them
on
the
head
smoothing
back
their
hair
gently
wrapping
them
tighter
in
their
late
one
night
when
the
weather
was
so
cold
a
young
fellow
sat
on
the
curbstone
and
kept
his
arm
around
a
pretty
young
girl
he
had
taken
off
his
ragged
and
folded
it
around
her
shoulders
and
as
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
she
complained
of
the
cold
he
tried
to
comfort
her
and
that
without
a
complaint
of
his
own
condition
being
clad
only
in
muslin
trowsers
and
waist
which
hung
in
shreds
from
his
body
thus
we
leave
the
largest
part
of
the
population
of
mexico
their
condition
is
most
touching
homeless
poor
uncared
for
untaught
they
live
and
they
die
they
are
worse
off
by
thousands
of
times
than
were
the
slaves
of
the
united
states
their
lives
are
hopeless
and
they
know
it
that
they
are
capable
of
learning
is
proven
by
their
work
and
by
their
intelligence
in
other
matters
they
have
a
desire
to
gain
book
knowledge
or
at
least
so
says
a
servant
who
was
taken
from
the
streets
who
now
spends
every
nickel
and
every
leisure
moment
in
trying
to
learn
wisdom
from
books
chapter
vi
how
sunday
is
celebrated
a
right
good
land
to
live
in
and
a
pleasant
land
to
see
every
day
is
sunday
yet
no
day
is
sunday
and
sunday
is
less
sunday
than
any
other
day
in
the
week
still
the
mexican
way
of
spending
sunday
is
of
interest
to
people
of
other
climes
and
habits
with
the
dawn
of
day
people
are
to
be
seen
wending
their
willing
footsteps
toward
their
church
the
bells
chime
with
their
musical
clang
historic
to
mexico
and
men
and
women
cross
the
threshold
of
churches
older
than
the
united
states
pews
are
unknown
and
on
the
bare
floor
the
millionaire
is
seen
beside
the
indian
the
superbly
clad
lady
side
by
side
with
an
uncombed
half
naked
mexican
woman
no
distinction
no
difference
there
they
kneel
and
offer
their
prayers
of
penitence
and
thanks
unmindful
of
rank
or
condition
no
turning
of
heads
to
look
at
strange
or
gaze
on
new
garments
no
dividing
the
poor
from
the
rich
but
all
with
uniform
thought
and
purpose
go
down
on
their
knees
to
their
god
how
a
missionary
after
one
sight
like
this
can
wish
to
convert
them
into
a
faith
where
dress
and
money
bring
attention
and
front
pews
and
where
the
dirty
beggar
is
ousted
by
the
janitor
and
indignantly
scorned
down
by
those
in
affluence
is
incomprehensible
no
mexican
lady
thinks
it
proper
to
wear
a
hat
into
church
she
thinks
it
shows
disgust
hence
the
fashion
of
wearing
lace
mantillas
in
this
city
of
rights
there
is
nothing
handsomer
than
a
lady
neatly
clad
in
black
with
a
mantilla
gracefully
wrapped
around
her
head
under
which
are
visible
hair
sparkling
eyes
and
beautiful
teeth
a
ragged
skirt
and
encircling
a
babe
with
its
head
on
its
mother
shoulder
fast
asleep
black
silky
hair
which
trails
on
the
floor
as
she
kneels
her
wan
brown
pathetic
face
raised
suppliantly
in
devotion
is
one
of
the
prettiest
though
most
common
sights
in
mexico
on
sunday
morning
this
is
the
busiest
day
in
the
markets
everything
is
booming
and
the
people
even
on
their
way
to
and
from
church
walk
in
and
out
around
the
thousands
of
stalls
buying
their
marketing
for
dinner
hucksters
cry
out
their
wares
and
all
goes
as
merry
as
a
birthday
party
indians
from
the
mountains
are
there
in
swarms
with
their
marketing
the
majority
of
stores
are
open
and
the
stalls
on
the
cheap
corner
do
the
biggest
business
of
the
week
those
who
do
not
attend
church
find
mexico
delightful
on
sunday
in
the
alameda
park
three
military
bands
stationed
in
different
quarters
play
alternately
all
forenoon
the
poor
have
a
passion
for
music
and
they
crowd
the
park
after
one
band
has
finished
they
rush
to
the
stand
of
the
next
where
they
stay
until
it
has
finished
and
then
move
to
the
next
thus
all
morning
they
go
around
in
a
circle
the
music
of
which
the
mexican
band
was
a
sample
is
superb
even
the
birds
are
charmed
sitting
on
the
mammoth
trees
which
grace
the
alameda
they
add
their
little
songs
all
this
mingled
with
the
many
chimes
which
ring
every
fifteen
minutes
make
the
scene
one
that
is
never
forgotten
the
rich
people
promenade
around
and
enjoy
themselves
similar
to
the
poor
in
the
zocalo
a
plazo
at
the
head
of
the
main
street
and
facing
the
palace
and
cathedral
the
band
plays
in
the
evening
also
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
maximilian
planned
and
had
made
a
drive
which
led
to
his
castle
at
chapultepec
it
is
feet
long
wide
enough
to
drive
four
or
even
six
teams
abreast
it
is
planted
on
the
east
side
with
two
rows
of
trees
one
edging
the
drive
the
other
the
walk
which
is
as
wide
as
many
streets
the
trees
are
now
of
immense
size
rendering
this
drive
one
of
the
handsomest
as
well
as
most
pleasant
in
mexico
maximilian
called
it
the
boulevarde
emperiale
but
when
liberty
was
proclaimed
the
name
was
changed
to
the
boulevarde
of
the
reform
on
the
same
drive
are
handsome
nay
more
magnificent
statues
of
columbus
quatemoc
and
an
equestrian
statue
of
charles
iv
of
wonderful
size
which
has
also
been
pronounced
perfect
by
good
judges
a
statue
of
cortez
is
being
erected
this
paseo
is
the
fashionable
promenade
and
drive
from
five
to
seven
every
day
and
specially
on
sunday
afternoon
the
music
stands
are
occupied
and
no
vacant
benches
are
to
be
found
those
who
call
the
mexicans
greasers
and
think
them
a
dumb
ignorant
class
should
see
the
paseo
on
sunday
coaches
elegant
english
gigs
handsome
coupes
and
carriages
drawn
by
the
finest
studs
are
a
common
sight
pittsburg
on
this
line
is
nowhere
in
comparison
cream
horses
with
silver
manes
and
tails
like
those
so
valued
in
other
cities
are
a
common
kind
here
the
most
fashionable
horse
has
mane
and
tail
bobbed
it
might
be
added
this
style
prevails
to
a
great
very
great
extent
among
all
animals
cats
and
dogs
appear
minus
ears
and
tails
pets
of
every
kind
are
much
in
demand
ladies
carry
lap
dogs
and
gentlemen
have
chained
to
them
blooded
dogs
of
mammoth
size
the
poor
mexican
will
have
his
tame
birds
even
roosters
are
stylish
pets
mary
had
a
little
lamb
is
respected
too
much
here
to
be
called
chestnut
the
favorite
pets
of
children
are
fleecy
lambs
which
with
bells
and
ribbons
about
their
necks
accompany
the
children
on
their
daily
airing
mexico
while
in
the
land
of
churches
would
be
rightly
called
the
city
of
high
heels
hats
powder
and
canes
every
gentleman
wears
a
silk
hat
and
swings
a
nobby
cane
there
are
but
two
styles
of
hats
the
tile
hat
and
the
sombrero
every
woman
powders
lays
it
on
in
chunks
and
wears
the
high
heels
known
as
the
french
opera
heel
the
style
extends
even
to
the
men
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
distinguish
foreigners
from
natives
is
to
look
at
their
feet
the
native
has
a
neat
shoe
with
heels
from
two
inches
up
while
the
foreigner
has
a
broad
shoe
and
low
heel
these
people
certainly
possess
the
smallest
hands
and
feet
of
any
nation
in
the
world
ladies
wear
fancy
shoes
entirely
beaded
bronzed
colored
leather
etc
a
common
black
leather
shoe
such
as
worn
by
women
in
the
states
is
an
unsalable
article
yet
it
is
nothing
strange
to
see
a
lady
clad
in
silk
or
velvet
lift
her
dress
to
cross
a
street
or
enter
a
carriage
and
display
a
satin
shoe
of
exquisite
make
and
above
it
the
hosiery
of
eve
in
fact
very
few
women
ever
wear
stockings
at
all
this
city
is
a
second
paris
in
the
matter
of
dress
among
the
the
styles
and
materials
are
badly
parisian
and
americans
who
come
here
expecting
to
see
people
are
disappointed
like
people
in
the
sister
republic
the
mexicans
judge
persons
by
their
dress
it
is
the
dress
first
and
the
man
after
on
sundays
the
streets
and
parks
are
thronged
with
men
and
women
selling
ice
cream
pulque
candies
cakes
and
other
dainties
they
carry
their
stock
on
their
heads
while
moving
and
when
they
stop
they
set
it
on
a
tripod
which
they
carry
in
their
arms
the
flower
sellers
are
always
women
some
of
whom
look
quite
picturesque
in
their
costumes
all
the
flowers
are
elegant
and
are
arranged
in
bouquets
to
suit
either
ladies
or
gentlemen
bull
fights
take
no
little
part
in
the
sunday
list
of
amusements
where
the
poor
and
rich
mingle
freely
theaters
have
matinees
and
evening
performances
and
everything
takes
on
a
holiday
look
and
everybody
appears
happy
and
this
is
nothing
new
in
mexico
however
for
the
most
unusual
sight
is
a
fight
or
quarrel
these
are
left
to
the
numerous
dogs
which
belong
to
the
city
and
even
they
do
little
of
it
riding
horseback
is
a
favorite
pastime
ladies
only
ride
in
the
forenoon
as
custom
prevents
them
from
indulging
in
the
saddle
after
one
gentlemen
however
ride
mornings
and
evening
among
them
are
to
be
found
the
most
graceful
and
daring
riders
in
the
world
their
outfits
are
gorgeous
true
mexican
saddle
trimmed
with
gold
and
silver
graceful
flaps
of
the
finest
fur
on
bridles
finished
with
numberless
silver
chains
the
riders
are
superb
in
yellow
goatskin
suits
ornamented
with
silver
horse
shoes
whips
spurs
with
silver
braid
on
the
short
coat
a
handsome
sombrero
finished
in
silver
with
silver
monogram
of
the
owner
revolvers
and
proud
fiery
horse
completed
the
picture
the
ladies
habits
are
similar
to
those
now
in
the
states
except
the
fine
sombrero
which
replaces
the
ugly
ungraceful
high
silk
hats
all
day
sunday
is
like
a
pleasant
fourth
of
july
but
after
eight
the
carriages
become
scarcer
and
scarcer
the
people
go
to
the
theaters
and
to
their
homes
the
poor
seek
a
soft
flagstone
where
they
repose
for
the
night
and
by
nine
the
streets
make
one
think
of
a
deserted
city
mexicans
do
not
go
half
way
in
the
matter
of
style
at
one
sunday
afternoons
policemen
in
fancy
uniforms
mounted
on
handsome
horses
equipped
with
guns
and
lassoes
ride
down
the
boulevard
they
are
stationed
in
the
center
of
the
drive
one
hundred
yards
apart
every
alternate
horse
head
in
the
same
direction
there
they
remain
like
statues
the
entire
afternoon
sunday
is
a
favorite
day
for
funerals
and
change
of
residence
men
with
wardrobes
pianos
on
their
backs
are
seen
trotting
up
and
down
the
streets
like
our
moving
wagons
on
the
first
day
of
april
they
mean
well
by
work
on
sunday
but
it
would
appear
awful
to
some
of
our
good
people
at
home
there
is
this
advantage
at
least
they
have
something
better
to
do
than
to
congregate
in
saloons
or
loaf
on
the
streets
chapter
vii
a
horseback
ride
over
historic
grounds
a
sunday
in
mexico
is
one
long
feast
of
champagne
without
a
headache
the
next
day
when
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
appear
in
the
east
people
bob
out
from
this
street
and
that
hostlers
hurry
horses
off
to
private
residences
gay
riders
whirl
by
as
if
eager
to
catch
the
shades
of
night
as
they
are
sinking
in
the
west
and
by
it
looks
as
if
all
mexico
was
on
horseback
ladies
wear
beautiful
costumes
dark
habits
short
skirts
silver
and
gold
buttons
and
broad
sombreros
men
display
greater
variety
of
costumes
some
wear
yellow
buckskin
suits
trimmed
with
gold
or
silver
others
have
a
drab
skin
suit
artistically
trimmed
still
others
wear
light
cloth
suits
and
high
boots
buttoned
at
the
side
and
reaching
the
knee
a
belt
holding
a
revolver
and
a
mexican
saddle
to
which
is
fastened
a
sword
complete
this
beautiful
riding
suit
and
then
what
riders
it
is
the
poetry
of
motion
they
are
as
but
part
of
the
perfect
horse
they
ride
take
the
beautiful
horses
artistic
outfit
grand
eyes
glancing
at
you
from
beneath
a
pretty
sombrero
and
you
have
a
mexican
scene
which
is
irresistible
even
americans
are
a
thousand
times
handsomer
when
they
don
this
outfit
and
it
is
safe
to
wager
that
if
the
men
in
the
states
would
adopt
the
mexican
there
would
not
be
a
single
man
left
after
a
two
months
trial
after
searching
the
whole
city
over
we
at
last
found
a
woman
we
knew
who
owned
a
habit
certainly
you
may
have
it
with
great
pleasure
and
we
thought
what
an
angel
she
was
until
the
time
we
needed
it
when
she
sent
a
reply
my
is
as
i
told
you
at
your
service
any
day
in
the
week
but
sunday
i
am
surprised
that
you
find
need
of
it
on
that
blessed
day
that
evening
on
going
to
a
house
for
dinner
we
found
her
there
dressed
to
the
height
of
fashion
discussing
the
people
who
had
attended
church
in
the
morning
and
telling
what
a
lovely
drive
she
had
on
the
in
the
afternoon
she
is
a
missionary
however
as
the
sun
was
creeping
up
trying
to
catch
night
unawares
i
mounted
a
horse
clad
in
a
unique
and
original
costume
to
say
the
very
least
which
the
gallant
young
men
however
pronounced
odd
and
pretty
and
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
the
style
of
the
states
the
boulevard
of
the
reform
looked
as
cool
and
sweet
as
a
may
morning
in
the
country
and
finer
than
a
circus
parade
with
the
hundreds
of
horsemen
going
either
way
let
us
go
mucho
gusto
with
much
pleasure
was
our
reply
and
away
flew
our
willing
steeds
bearing
us
soon
to
the
paradise
of
mexico
chapultepec
greeting
the
guards
at
the
gate
we
entered
riding
under
trees
which
sheltered
montezuma
and
his
people
cortes
and
his
soldiers
poor
maximilian
and
charlotta
where
mexican
cadets
laid
down
their
lives
in
defense
of
their
country
where
the
last
battle
was
fought
with
the
americans
and
where
now
is
being
prepared
the
future
home
of
president
diaz
around
the
castle
and
through
the
grounds
we
at
last
emerged
at
the
opposite
side
here
a
scene
worthy
of
an
artist
brush
was
found
in
a
small
adobe
house
faced
in
front
by
a
porch
were
mexicans
dealing
out
coffee
and
pulque
to
the
horsemen
who
surrounded
the
place
one
had
even
ridden
into
the
house
awaiting
our
turn
we
viewed
the
scene
on
our
left
were
mounted
and
unmounted
uniformed
soldiers
guarding
one
of
the
gates
to
chapultepec
at
our
back
were
trains
of
loaded
burros
about
on
their
way
to
market
in
the
city
they
stood
around
and
about
the
old
aqueduct
the
picture
of
patience
some
few
had
lain
down
with
their
burdens
and
had
to
be
assisted
to
their
feet
by
their
masters
numerous
little
charcoal
fires
above
which
were
suspended
pans
and
kettles
were
being
fanned
by
enterprising
peons
who
had
started
this
restaurant
to
make
a
few
pennies
from
their
fellowmen
one
fellow
cut
all
kinds
of
meat
on
a
flat
stone
into
little
pieces
which
he
deposited
together
in
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
picking
them
out
again
with
a
long
stick
sold
them
to
the
waiting
people
some
women
were
busily
knitting
weaving
baskets
as
they
waited
for
this
dainty
repast
at
last
our
turn
came
and
we
turned
our
back
on
the
outdoor
restaurants
while
we
endeavored
to
swallow
a
little
bit
of
the
miserable
stuff
they
called
coffee
as
we
started
we
saw
the
people
adjust
the
burdens
to
their
backs
take
up
their
long
and
start
their
burros
toward
the
city
they
had
feasted
and
were
now
ready
to
continue
their
journey
leaping
a
ditch
we
left
the
highway
and
traveled
through
the
fields
stopping
to
gather
a
few
pepper
berries
with
which
to
decorate
ourselves
admiring
the
birds
flitting
from
tree
to
tree
another
ditch
which
the
horses
cleared
beautifully
was
left
behind
and
we
were
once
again
on
a
highway
with
dust
about
a
foot
deep
which
made
horses
cough
as
well
as
their
riders
this
is
bad
one
of
the
gentlemen
managed
to
say
at
last
we
were
only
able
to
give
a
sympathetic
grunt
and
then
had
to
gasp
fifteen
minutes
before
we
could
regain
our
breath
there
is
a
hacienda
near
where
we
will
get
a
drink
and
change
roads
vamos
off
we
went
leaving
the
dust
behind
and
were
soon
in
the
shaded
drive
leading
to
the
hacienda
here
at
huischal
we
soon
forgot
the
scorching
sun
and
blinding
dust
and
gave
ourselves
up
to
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
watching
the
ever
picturesque
people
gathered
in
groups
beneath
the
shade
under
the
trees
were
droves
of
horses
which
were
taken
two
by
two
and
led
into
a
large
walled
pond
a
peon
walked
on
the
wall
holding
the
bridle
of
the
tethered
horses
who
swam
from
one
end
to
the
other
covered
all
but
the
head
after
the
bath
the
horses
were
rubbed
well
until
they
glistened
like
satin
climbing
the
hill
we
passed
all
kinds
of
indians
and
huts
there
were
homes
built
entirely
of
the
maguey
plant
where
straw
mats
served
for
beds
the
people
were
all
awake
and
engaged
in
various
occupations
some
women
were
washing
some
were
making
their
toilet
combing
their
hair
with
the
same
kind
of
brush
they
scrub
with
and
washing
their
bodies
with
a
porous
soapstone
common
to
the
country
very
few
of
the
children
had
any
clothing
at
all
but
happiness
reigned
supreme
we
passed
several
plain
wooden
crosses
with
inscriptions
on
them
asking
travelers
to
pray
for
the
deceased
soul
it
brought
forcibly
to
mind
byron
childe
harold
quite
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
facing
chapultepec
gleams
a
marble
monument
erected
in
honor
of
the
mexicans
killed
while
defending
casa
de
mata
the
house
of
the
dead
and
el
molino
del
rey
the
mill
of
the
king
the
americans
discovered
while
encamped
near
here
that
cannon
were
being
manufactured
at
el
molino
so
they
decided
to
storm
the
place
they
found
the
work
more
difficult
than
they
expected
the
mexicans
were
fighting
for
a
country
they
loved
and
for
which
they
had
been
compelled
to
fight
for
generations
their
walls
were
strong
but
at
last
they
gave
way
before
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
americans
and
their
dead
covered
the
battlefield
casa
de
mata
is
now
a
garrison
and
the
soldiers
march
back
and
forth
with
sad
faces
el
molino
del
rey
now
furnishes
flour
for
the
city
it
shows
no
trace
of
the
assault
near
by
is
a
foundry
for
the
manufacture
of
guns
and
munitions
the
city
of
the
dead
dolores
lies
to
the
back
of
the
mill
funeral
cars
and
draped
street
cars
were
just
returning
from
the
cemetery
and
as
the
people
are
not
allowed
to
ride
or
drive
along
this
carway
we
crossed
into
a
plantation
of
pulque
plant
it
is
a
resentful
thing
and
a
whole
army
in
itself
it
ran
its
sharp
prongs
into
the
legs
of
the
men
endeavored
to
pull
the
skirts
off
the
women
and
played
spurs
on
the
horses
but
we
finally
emerged
at
the
entrance
of
the
cemetery
alive
but
wiser
from
our
experience
mexican
cemeteries
have
a
certain
peculiar
beauty
and
yet
they
are
ugly
no
one
is
allowed
to
ride
or
drive
through
coffins
are
carried
in
and
everybody
is
compelled
to
walk
beautiful
trees
are
cultivated
even
the
apple
and
the
peach
being
reared
for
ornament
the
walks
are
laid
out
nicely
spruce
trees
are
trained
to
form
an
arbor
for
long
distances
where
they
are
divided
or
meet
another
walk
flowing
fountains
with
large
basins
and
statues
grace
the
spot
one
statue
which
looked
rather
singular
was
apparently
carved
out
of
wood
it
represented
a
man
with
flowing
locks
and
beard
clad
in
a
long
gown
and
holding
in
one
hand
a
round
ball
time
had
its
hand
on
heavily
and
the
wood
was
seamed
and
browned
altogether
it
was
a
thing
the
keeper
said
it
represented
christ
with
the
world
in
his
hand
not
a
sprig
of
grass
is
permitted
to
grow
in
any
of
the
graveyards
and
they
are
swept
as
clean
as
our
grandmother
backyard
used
to
be
men
were
busy
digging
graves
and
new
ones
were
completely
hidden
by
fresh
flowers
and
the
flowers
on
others
were
withered
and
dead
as
if
the
one
so
lately
buried
was
already
forgotten
the
monuments
are
quite
fine
some
have
little
altars
on
which
candles
are
lighted
on
certain
days
the
prevailing
style
of
marble
shaft
is
coffin
shaped
some
graves
have
miniature
built
over
them
the
framework
covered
with
spanish
moss
the
effect
is
beautiful
the
poor
have
only
black
and
white
wooden
crosses
to
mark
their
ashes
one
family
had
built
a
cave
formed
of
volcanic
stone
over
the
grave
the
effect
being
quite
pretty
and
unique
after
partaking
of
refreshments
at
a
long
low
building
just
outside
the
cemetery
gate
we
rode
across
the
country
and
into
tacubaya
an
ancient
city
once
the
home
of
montezuma
favorite
chief
where
the
american
soldiers
were
encamped
now
the
home
of
mexican
millionaires
the
site
of
the
feast
of
the
gamblers
and
the
prettiest
village
in
mexico
the
gambling
feast
has
ended
and
the
town
has
been
restored
to
its
usual
quietness
in
the
center
plaza
a
band
was
holding
forth
as
is
the
custom
in
every
mexican
village
on
sunday
mornings
people
had
gathered
in
sun
and
shade
listening
the
markets
were
in
full
blast
the
thousands
of
luscious
fruits
looking
fresh
and
inviting
as
they
were
spread
on
the
ground
awaiting
buyers
the
native
ware
was
so
peculiar
and
the
merchant
brown
and
pleasant
was
more
than
we
could
resist
so
buying
two
small
cream
jugs
made
after
the
style
in
vogue
fifty
years
ago
we
paid
him
two
reals
fifty
cents
and
departed
leaving
him
happy
once
again
the
willing
horses
climbed
the
hill
and
reaching
the
summit
we
inspected
the
waterworks
which
have
so
faithfully
supplied
the
city
for
years
a
frame
house
hid
the
well
or
spring
that
has
given
such
a
generous
supply
a
wooden
wheel
as
large
as
the
house
itself
moved
slowly
as
if
age
and
rheumatism
had
stiffened
its
joints
the
water
flowed
gently
through
an
open
trench
into
another
building
whence
it
rushed
white
foaming
and
sparkling
into
the
ground
leaving
only
high
brick
to
mark
its
course
to
the
aqueduct
by
the
side
of
the
trench
a
woman
was
doing
her
washing
and
two
little
lads
with
poles
across
their
shoulders
and
buckets
suspended
from
either
end
were
carrying
water
to
the
houses
down
in
the
valley
an
old
cow
with
curly
horns
gazed
at
us
in
astonishment
as
we
invaded
her
private
meadow
to
get
a
view
of
a
paper
mill
which
is
built
in
the
shape
of
an
old
english
castle
down
in
a
deep
ravine
in
a
nest
of
lovely
green
trees
the
old
cow
had
evidently
come
to
the
conclusion
after
deliberate
reasoning
that
we
were
intruding
and
she
charged
our
horses
in
a
toro
style
there
were
no
to
attract
her
attention
no
for
us
to
hide
behind
so
we
thought
it
best
to
fly
which
we
did
with
a
maud
s
speed
i
did
not
mention
i
had
lost
my
hat
in
the
retreat
until
we
were
over
the
trench
and
one
of
the
young
men
gallantly
started
to
recover
it
against
the
protestations
of
the
entire
crowd
we
expected
to
see
him
killed
but
the
cow
stood
watching
him
as
he
dismounted
for
the
feminine
headgear
gesticulating
with
head
and
tail
and
beating
the
earth
with
her
fore
legs
remounting
he
saluted
her
then
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
he
cleared
the
ditch
leaving
the
baffled
and
angry
cow
on
the
other
side
la
castaneda
the
great
of
the
mexicans
was
next
visited
beautiful
flowers
shrubbery
and
marble
statues
grace
the
resort
neat
little
benches
cunning
little
nooks
secluded
deep
are
a
few
of
the
many
attractions
shaded
walks
and
twisting
stairways
would
always
bring
us
to
some
new
beauty
music
and
dancing
are
always
held
here
every
afternoon
and
although
it
was
nearly
noon
they
had
not
even
so
much
as
a
cracker
in
the
house
in
mexico
nothing
in
the
line
of
edibles
is
kept
in
the
house
overnight
at
mixcoac
we
visited
the
famous
flower
gardens
and
viewed
the
site
where
the
american
soldiers
were
garrisoned
during
the
war
the
mexicans
have
found
a
new
thing
a
pun
and
they
are
enjoying
it
heartily
it
is
not
very
brilliant
or
very
funny
but
it
is
traveling
over
the
city
and
every
person
has
to
repeat
it
to
you
an
american
wanted
to
see
mixcoac
pronounced
the
conductor
failed
to
let
him
out
at
the
place
and
turning
to
the
mexicans
he
said
we
have
but
it
was
funnier
still
to
an
american
who
was
being
showed
around
by
a
mexican
who
spoke
very
little
english
i
will
take
you
to
see
said
the
mexican
the
american
expressed
his
pleasure
and
willingness
this
is
all
said
the
mexican
pointing
around
the
entire
town
indeed
ejaculated
the
astonished
tourist
miss
quack
must
be
very
wealthy
down
the
dusty
road
we
came
passing
natives
shooting
the
pretty
birds
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
all
other
riders
had
disappeared
and
people
looked
at
us
from
beneath
the
shade
in
amazement
and
even
we
felt
a
little
tired
and
heated
after
a
ride
we
reached
home
at
one
since
then
i
have
been
wearing
blisters
on
my
cheeks
and
nose
and
making
frequent
applications
with
the
powder
rag
of
the
literary
widow
and
artist
who
room
across
the
way
chapter
viii
a
mexican
mexicans
are
always
mauana
until
it
comes
to
and
love
affairs
to
know
a
mexican
in
daily
life
is
to
witness
his
courtesy
his
politeness
gentleness
and
then
see
him
at
a
and
he
is
hardly
recognizable
he
is
literally
transformed
his
gentleness
and
mauana
have
disappeared
his
eyes
flash
his
cheeks
flush
in
fact
he
is
the
picture
of
diabolic
animation
it
is
all
hoy
with
him
even
the
spanish
lady
of
ease
and
high
heels
forgets
her
mannerisms
and
appears
like
some
painted
heathen
jubilant
over
the
roasting
of
a
zealous
missionary
there
have
been
some
very
good
lately
in
the
suburbs
for
fighting
is
prohibited
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
city
when
they
say
a
good
it
means
that
the
bulls
have
been
ferocious
and
many
horses
and
men
have
been
killed
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
majority
of
americans
who
visit
mexico
do
like
the
natives
even
on
the
first
sunday
attend
divine
service
in
the
morning
a
in
the
afternoon
and
theater
in
the
evening
but
it
is
with
regret
that
i
say
that
many
americans
who
are
residents
of
the
city
now
are
as
passionately
fond
of
the
national
inhuman
sport
as
a
native
who
has
been
reared
up
to
it
some
never
miss
a
fight
and
their
american
voice
outstrips
the
mexican
in
the
shouts
of
bravo
at
the
bloody
thrusts
yet
there
are
tourists
who
can
not
outsit
one
performance
and
have
no
desire
to
attend
a
second
while
we
americans
cry
brutal
against
the
national
amusement
they
in
return
cry
brutal
to
our
in
which
they
see
nothing
to
admire
and
a
is
beneath
their
contempt
your
humane
societies
would
prevent
in
the
states
said
a
spanish
gentleman
your
people
would
cry
out
against
them
yet
they
have
strong
men
trying
to
pound
one
another
to
death
and
the
people
clamor
for
admission
to
see
the
law
kill
men
and
women
while
in
health
and
youth
because
of
some
deed
done
in
the
flesh
yes
they
witness
and
allow
such
inhuman
treatment
to
a
fellow
mortal
and
turn
around
and
affect
holy
horror
at
us
for
taking
out
of
the
world
a
few
old
horses
and
furnishing
beef
for
the
poor
read
of
glorious
and
then
witness
one
and
the
scene
is
entirely
changed
the
day
of
their
glory
has
departed
when
maximilian
graced
the
country
with
his
presence
the
fights
were
indeed
fitted
for
royal
sight
the
costumes
were
of
the
costliest
material
the
horses
were
of
the
best
blood
and
breed
and
the
bulls
regular
roaring
texans
which
needed
no
second
sight
of
a
red
to
raise
their
feverish
ire
no
fight
cost
less
than
now
all
is
different
maximilian
lies
in
a
grave
to
which
a
treacherous
bullet
consigned
him
carlotta
still
what
that
bullet
made
her
a
raving
lunatic
and
a
widow
men
of
low
degree
are
permitted
to
grace
the
fights
which
are
but
miserable
shadows
a
farce
of
the
former
royal
days
the
national
a
narrow
gauge
and
the
mexican
central
run
special
trains
consisting
of
twenty
and
cars
first
second
and
to
the
fights
every
half
hour
tickets
are
sold
during
the
week
which
include
railroad
fare
admission
to
grounds
and
seat
long
before
the
time
for
leaving
carriages
pull
up
to
the
stations
and
blooming
senoras
fair
senoritas
handsome
senors
and
delicate
lovely
children
dressed
in
the
height
of
wealth
and
fashion
enter
the
railway
coach
and
proceed
to
make
themselves
comfortable
for
the
half
hour
or
hour
ride
which
is
to
bring
them
to
their
destination
bands
march
up
and
are
disposed
of
in
the
coaches
and
last
comes
a
troop
of
soldiers
clad
in
buckskin
suits
elaborately
trimmed
with
silver
ornaments
yard
wide
sombreros
and
armed
with
gun
revolver
sword
dagger
mace
and
lasso
which
they
have
no
hesitation
in
using
in
quite
a
characteristic
manner
asking
no
questions
expecting
no
information
performing
their
duties
fatally
they
are
the
daisies
of
mexico
and
in
appreciation
of
which
they
are
sent
to
grace
every
bull
fight
they
are
the
best
paid
soldiers
in
the
republic
receiving
a
day
while
the
highest
salary
paid
to
any
of
the
others
is
cents
daily
out
of
which
they
provide
their
own
wearing
apparel
and
food
the
same
daisies
were
all
outlaws
bandits
fierce
and
uncontrollable
their
many
deeds
always
done
in
the
name
of
the
law
are
fearful
to
relate
so
the
present
president
thought
it
policy
to
engage
their
services
they
ride
handsome
horses
furnished
by
the
government
and
are
said
to
be
the
most
faithful
reliable
men
in
the
employ
of
the
republic
their
only
fault
is
killing
without
asking
questions
for
which
they
go
without
even
so
much
as
a
rebuke
the
daisies
have
some
of
the
finest
specimens
of
manhood
in
mexico
and
number
in
their
list
some
handsome
youthful
boys
they
can
maintain
order
among
people
filled
with
pulque
without
uttering
one
word
their
presence
is
sufficient
on
speeds
the
train
above
the
din
arises
the
musical
sound
of
a
strange
language
a
view
from
the
window
exhibits
some
of
mexico
most
beautiful
scenery
now
we
pass
beautiful
farms
magnificent
artificial
lakes
covered
with
wild
duck
which
would
delight
the
heart
of
our
american
hunters
as
they
arise
in
dark
clouds
on
the
approach
of
the
train
and
move
off
to
a
more
secluded
spot
beautiful
fields
of
grain
and
acres
and
acres
of
pulque
plant
quaint
huts
picturesque
historic
churches
ancient
monastries
and
convents
now
used
for
other
purposes
all
surrounded
by
mountains
for
miles
we
keep
our
eyes
on
the
strangest
and
grandest
mountain
in
mexico
the
white
lady
or
the
sleeping
virgin
it
deserves
chapters
of
description
and
praise
but
feeling
our
inability
to
do
it
justice
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
a
brief
remark
outlined
against
a
blue
sky
only
such
skies
as
are
habitual
to
italy
and
mexico
is
a
mountain
in
form
of
a
woman
lying
on
a
straight
cot
on
the
head
is
a
snow
band
such
as
worn
by
sisters
of
mercy
the
arms
are
folded
peacefully
on
the
breast
and
the
snow
garments
fall
in
graceful
folds
over
the
feet
there
she
lies
and
has
lain
for
centuries
in
perfect
outline
and
peaceful
repose
even
as
we
look
the
clouds
play
fantastically
about
the
beauteous
form
now
they
cover
her
body
like
a
dark
shroud
again
they
drape
her
cot
like
a
pall
then
rise
in
a
threatening
attitude
above
her
fair
head
but
undisturbed
she
lies
there
with
hands
ever
folded
above
the
quiet
heart
proudly
indifferent
to
storm
or
shine
clad
in
her
pure
snowy
garments
truly
the
most
beauteous
sight
in
mexico
with
a
sigh
we
at
last
leave
her
behind
and
are
rudely
brought
to
earth
by
the
announcement
that
we
have
reached
our
destination
the
bull
ring
resembles
somewhat
a
racecourse
the
highest
row
is
covered
and
called
boxes
they
are
divided
into
small
squares
which
are
meant
to
hold
six
but
are
crowded
with
four
miserable
chairs
without
backs
are
the
comfortable
seats
below
is
the
amphitheater
arranged
exactly
like
circus
seats
different
prices
are
charged
and
the
cheapest
is
the
sunny
side
where
all
the
poor
sit
a
fence
painted
in
the
national
colors
red
green
and
white
of
some
six
feet
in
height
incloses
the
ring
three
equal
distances
apart
are
filled
with
brilliantly
uniformed
musicians
the
judge
is
appointed
by
the
municipality
but
the
fighters
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
fight
under
one
judge
whom
they
think
will
compel
them
to
take
unnecessary
risks
with
a
treacherous
bull
for
a
judge
once
chosen
his
commands
are
law
and
no
excuse
will
be
accepted
for
not
obeying
but
a
fine
deducted
from
the
fighter
salary
and
he
loses
cast
with
the
audience
the
judge
is
in
a
box
in
the
center
of
the
shady
side
with
him
is
some
prominent
man
for
every
fight
must
be
honored
with
the
presence
of
some
individual
while
behind
stands
the
bugler
a
small
boy
in
gay
uniform
with
a
bugle
slung
to
his
side
by
which
he
conveys
the
judge
whispered
commands
to
the
fighters
in
the
ring
below
the
judge
hangs
a
row
of
banderillas
they
are
wooden
sticks
about
two
feet
long
with
a
barbed
spear
of
steel
in
the
end
which
are
stuck
in
the
bull
to
gore
him
to
madness
they
are
always
gayly
decorated
with
tinsel
and
gaudy
streamers
of
the
national
colors
sometimes
firecrackers
are
ingeniously
inserted
which
go
off
when
the
banderilla
is
deftly
fastened
in
the
beast
quivering
flesh
the
bands
play
alternately
lively
airs
the
audience
for
once
find
no
charms
in
the
music
and
forget
to
murmur
mauana
but
soon
begin
to
cry
el
toro
el
toro
the
bull
the
bull
the
judge
nods
to
the
bugler
and
as
he
trumpets
forth
the
gate
is
swung
open
and
the
grand
entry
is
made
first
comes
el
capitan
or
matador
chief
of
the
ring
and
the
men
who
kill
the
bull
with
a
sword
next

elaborately
trimmed
with
silver

broad
expensive
sombreros

ride
fine

do
some
very
pretty
work

two
gayly
painted
clowns

unlike
those
in

never

anything

are
always
necessary

the

form
a
semicircle
around
a
door
el
capitan
draws
a
bolt
flings
it
open
and
as
the
bull
springs
forth
from
his
dark
and
narrow
cell
a
man
perched
above
sticks
two
into
his
neck
to
madden
him
with
a
snort
of
rage

rushes
for

equally
distant
at

a

faces
the

with

with

makes
for

so
silent
you
can

can
be
no

escape
for
the
man
but
just
as
you
think
the
bull
will
lift
him
on
his
horns
you
see
the
two
banderillas
stuck
one
in
either
side
of
the
neck
and
the
man
springs
safely
over
the
lowered
head
and
murderous
horns

infuriated
animal

it
rushes
forward
to
find
the
victim
has
escaped
the
audience
shout
bravo
and
wave
their
serapes
sombreros
and
clap
their
hands
the
bull
roars
with
pain
and
the
banderillas
toss
about
in
the
lacerated
flesh
from
which
the
blood
pours
in
crimson
streams
poor
beast
what
a
shame
we
think
and
even
then
the
order
is
given
for
the
picador
to
attack
the
bull
the
horse
on
which
the
picador
is
mounted
is
bought
only
to
be
killed
it
is
an
old
beast
whose
days
of
beauty
and
usefulness
are
over
or
buys
him
for
the
purpose
sometimes
he
is
hardly
able
to
walk
into
the
ring
first
the
brute
is
blindfolded
with
a
leather
band
and
a
leather
apron
is
fastened
around
his
neck
in
pretense
of
saving
him
from
being
gored
the
picador
guides
the
blinded
horse
to
face
the
bull
are
flung
before
the
bull
tauntingly
the
picador
dives
the
pica
into
the
beast
and
it
vents
its
pain
on
the
horse
blood
pours
from
the
wound
trembling
the
horse
stands
unable
to
see
what
has
wounded
it
again
they
coax
the
bull
to
charge
and
place
the
horse
so
that
the
murderous
horns
will
disembowel
it
down
goes
the
blinded
beast
and
the
capeadores
flaunt
their
at
the
bull
while
the
picadore
gets
off
the
dying
animal
which
is
lassoed
and
dragged
from
the
ring
another
horse
is
brought
in
and
the
same
work
is
gone
over
until
the
horse
is
killed
every
bull
is
allowed
to
kill
two
horses
and
then
the
people
shout
muerie
muerie
kill
the
bull
the
judge
gives
the
command
and
the
matador
bows
to
the
judge
and
then
teases
the
bull
with
his
red
the
laws
prohibit
a
fighter
to
strike
a
bull
until
it
first
charges
and
the
bull
has
the
chance
of
three
charges
at
the
matador
before
he
dares
to
strike
the
bull
never
appears
to
see
the
man
by
his
side
but
furiously
fights
the
red
held
before
him
then
plunges
the
sword
into
the
neck
between
the
shoulders
and
through
to
the
heart
if
deftly
done
after
which
the
bull
staggers
protrudes
its
tongue
tries
to
find
a
door
for
escape
stumbles
and
dies
again
the
people
shout
and
the
matador
as
he
makes
his
bow
to
the
judge
is
thrown
money
cigars
fruit
flowers
and
other
favors
men
fling
in
their
and
and
consider
it
a
great
honor
when
he
picks
them
up
and
tosses
them
back
during
all
this
the
three
mules
are
brought
in
at
the
sight
of
the
dead
bull
they
plunge
and
tear
but
are
finally
hitched
to
it
the
clowns
jump
on
the
dead
beast
and
it
is
hauled
from
the
ring
when
the
bull
is
tame
and
though
tortured
on
all
sides
still
refuses
to
gore
the
horse
the
people
hiss
and
shout
until
the
judge
gives
the
command
for
the
brute
that
is
more
humane
than
its
tormentors
to
be
removed
and
replaced
by
one
that
will
sate
their
feverish
desire
for
blood
now
is
the
time
for
the
to
get
in
some
pretty
work
the
space
is
small
and
cramped
but
with
a
deftness
that
is
bewildering
they
throw
the
loop
over
the
horns
the
knowing
horse
dodges
the
bull
loses
his
balance
and
the
horse
gives
a
sudden
jerk
throwing
the
bull
on
the
ground
he
is
then
allowed
to
arise
and
is
started
around
the
ring
at
a
merry
gallop
while
the
second
exhibits
great
skill
in
lassoing
the
feet
front
and
back
of
the
running
beast
the
bull
after
being
thrown
realizes
he
is
at
their
mercy
and
lies
passive
or
trembling
with
fear
and
pain
while
the
brutal
clowns
spring
astride
the
prostrated
beast
and
with
no
gentle
hand
tear
the
banderillas
from
the
quivering
flesh
which
still
warm
and
dripping
with
blood
are
sold
as
trophies
at
one
and
two
dollars
each
then
the
butcher
steps
forth
and
with
a
sharp
knife
cuts
the
spinal
cord
and
the
beast
is
done
for
when
a
bull
refuses
to
fight
before
he
is
cut
except
for
wounds
from
the
pica
and
banderillas
the
people
cry
in
spanish
he
is
a
weak
woman
until
the
judge
orders
his
removal
it
is
difficult
work
and
affords
much
fun
for
the
mexicans
for
the
bull
must
be
forced
back
into
the
dark
cell
whence
he
came
one
fight
consists
of
four
bulls
and
as
many
old
horses
as
they
can
be
compelled
to
kill
a
bull
is
not
considered
much
unless
he
can
kill
at
the
very
least
two
horses
the
poor
horses
are
very
seldom
killed
instantly
when
wounded
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
walk
they
are
dragged
from
the
ring
and
left
in
a
vacant
field
where
they
die
that
night
or
the
following
day
as
the
mexicans
do
not
consider
them
worth
a
bullet
the
bull
finds
more
mercy
if
not
killed
outright
by
the
matador
a
butcher
finishes
the
work
and
ends
the
misery
when
stabbed
fatally
he
often
staggers
along
the
fence
as
though
in
hopes
of
finding
an
exit
the
cruel
spectators
are
not
satisfied
that
he
is
dying
and
allow
him
some
little
mercy
but
stab
his
wounded
flesh
tear
open
his
death
wound
twist
his
tail
do
all
in
their
power
to
enhance
his
sufferings
until
he
falls
dead
one
would
suppose
the
heated
tortured
wounded
beef
would
be
of
no
account
but
such
is
not
the
case
before
many
hours
after
taken
from
the
scene
of
its
death
the
beef
is
being
sold
to
the
people
who
buy
it
without
the
least
hesitancy
or
disgust
even
boasting
that
they
eat
of
the
bull
that
killed
so
many
horses
and
if
it
happened
to
kill
a
man
it
is
considered
an
honor
to
eat
of
it
this
makes
an
american
want
little
beef
and
that
little
covered
with
red
pepper
to
kill
the
taste
when
seated
opposite
the
entrance
gate
one
has
full
view
of
the
butcher
at
work
the
hide
is
taken
off
the
toro
immediately
and
it
is
dissected
then
they
commence
on
the
horses
but
they
claim
the
horses
flesh
is
not
sold
for
beef
at
some
fights
the
spectators
are
favored
with
a
performer
who
allows
the
maddened
toro
to
attack
him
when
by
the
aid
of
a
long
pole
he
jumps
clear
over
it
this
is
a
dangerous
and
many
times
a
fatal
leap
but
is
a
favorite
sight
of
the
people
after
the
fight
comes
the
a
bull
with
balls
on
its
horns
is
led
in
all
the
paid
fighters
leave
the
ring
and
any
one
among
the
spectators
who
has
a
desire
to
try
the
sport
can
do
so
the
number
is
not
few
and
the
sight
is
really
funny
they
wave
their
at
the
bull
who
in
return
often
tosses
them
on
his
horns
the
prevent
him
from
trampling
them
and
it
is
very
seldom
anyone
is
killed
though
broken
arms
and
ribs
are
no
unusual
thing
this
is
the
proudest
day
of
the
mexican
life
when
he
gains
access
to
the
bull
ring
and
can
exhibit
to
people
his
activity
and
daring
the
most
risky
amateur
is
then
given
a
position
as
fighter
a
position
he
considers
greater
than
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
and
for
which
he
would
not
exchange
the
government
charges
a
license
of
for
each
fight
if
the
bulls
are
tame
the
show
is
fined
for
giving
a
poor
performance
and
swindling
the
people
the
el
capitan
whose
duty
it
is
to
strike
the
bull
heart
with
a
sword
gets
the
highest
salary
as
much
as
a
performance
the
other
fighters
receive
from
to
sometimes
a
fight
is
given
for
charitable
purposes
young
girls
dressed
like
brides
in
white
satin
veil
and
satin
shoes
do
all
the
directing
and
young
men
of
position
and
birth
are
the
fighters
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
when
a
man
is
killed
in
the
ring
the
fight
would
stop
but
that
only
seems
to
whet
their
desire
for
more
blood
and
a
dead
man
is
pulled
off
the
field
and
another
takes
his
place
amid
increased
enthusiasm
at
a
fight
two
weeks
ago
one
man
was
gored
almost
to
death
another
had
his
arm
broken
and
a
woman
who
had
witnessed
this
from
her
seat
entered
the
ring
and
tried
to
kill
the
bull
she
was
caught
on
its
horns
and
carried
once
around
the
ring
and
whirled
around
in
her
perilous
position
like
a
top
the
audience
shouted
and
was
much
disappointed
when
the
bull
cast
the
woman
to
the
ground
devoid
of
clothing
and
badly
bruised
but
alive
at
another
fight
three
men
were
killed
both
times
the
spectators
could
hardly
be
forced
to
leave
at
the
end
of
the
performance
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
that
beef
sold
at
a
high
price
bernardo

the
man
who
was
gored
almost
to
death
two
weeks

has
quite
a
history
he
came
from
spain
years
ago
and
is
years
old
the
oldest
fighter
in
mexico
and
the
most
famous
he
has
fought
in
every
bull

in

republic
and
has
killed
four

a
fellow

but
lacking
eighteen

of
one
hundred
is
as
strong
as

of
he
is
a
great
favorite
and
has
received
numerous
and
costly
presents
among
which
he
numbers
one
thousand
fine
bulls
but
he
is
very
poor
and
has
only
his
salary
he
is
unmarried
though
the
idol
and
favorite
of
the
people
they
shouted
with
joy
when
they
saw
him
being
gored
the
bull
caught
him
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
though
making
only
one
wound
outside
made
five
inside
he
was
carried
off
for
dead
but
though
having
a
wound
that
would
have
finished
any
other
man
he
is
still
living
and
asserts
he
will
repay
many
bulls
yet
for
his
sufferings

honor

a
nephew
juan

gives
promise

being
the

he
is
a
of
magnificent
build
with
a
handsome
face
fair
complexion
with

shouts
are
long

can
accomplish
the
daring
feat
of
striking
the
bull
heart
with
one
thrust
of
the
sword
which
he
withdraws
instantly
this
is
considered
scientific
for
when
the
sword
strikes
the
heart
it
is
very
difficult
to
withdraw
and
is
most
always
left
sticking
in
until
the
bull
dies
in
the
frontier
the
horns
are
sawed
off
the
bulls
before
they
go
in

cruel
torture

depart

their
way

manage
at

to
get
into

them
emerge

with

giving
their
opinions
of

do
not

point
of

the

which
is
in

not
the
kind
of
a
museum
where
you
have
a

for

place

hundred
and
pieces
used
by
maximilian
and
carlotta
each
piece
bears
the
arms
of
the
empire
and
the
mark
of
the
factory
cristofle
it
is
massive
and
elegant
little
silver
cupids
with
wreaths
of
flowers
are
placed
in
every
available
spot
many
of
the
pieces
are
a
load
for
two
men
a
bronze
bust

of
maximilian
has
decorations
and
ten
halberds
with
blue
and
gold
trimmings
ordered
by
the
emperor
to
be
used
by
the
palace
guard
on
state
occasions
are
all
placed
side
by
side
in
a
case
in
the
same
room
are
a
number
of
loose
pieces
of
armor
worn
by
the
conquerors
two
pieces
a
breast
plate
and
helmet
have
the
name
of

line
the
room
they
were
removed
from
the
national
palace
here
on
the
establishment
of
the
independence
of
the
republic
the
frames
are
of
black
wood
and
the
paintings
are
old
style
it
may
have
been
the
fashion
in
the
day
of
white
queues
to
always
have
one
off
eye
for
one
eye
in
nearly
all
the
pictures
goes
a
different
direction
from
its
mate
and
in
many
instances
the
off
eye
is
as
roguish
as
a
little
brother
making
you
imagine
the
old
rascals
are
going
to
wink
while
the
opposite
orb
gazes
out
in
expression
the
effect
is
ludicrous
the
of
the
emperor
iturbide
containing
excellent
portraits
of

and

is
also
shown
in
this

in
the

in
a

lying
on
a
red
satin

is
a
plaster

cast
of
the
face
of

the
much
beloved
indian
president
hairs
of
his
head
are
still
adhering
to
the
plaster
and
it
is
certainly
the
finest
thing
of
the
kind
ever
executed
the
portraits
of
fernando

agustin

one
of

who
was
the
third
president
of
the
republic
are
here
to
say
nothing
of
other
things
of
historic
value
such
as
the
arms
of
the
mexican
republic
made
in
surrounded
with
indian
mosaic
feather
work
an
old
worn
damask
banner
used
by
cortes
in
his
second
expedition
against
the
great
montezuma
and
the
arms
of
the
city
of
texcoco
presented
by
charles
of
germany
and
charles
of
spain
the
little
idols
perhaps
attract
more
attention
than
anything
else
at
the
museum
in
two
long
rooms
the
cases
lining
the
walls
are
filled
with
idols
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
made
of
stone
onyx
and
marble
some
of
the
pottery
is
horribly
exquisite
beads
used
by
the
indians
made
of
stones
teeth
and
bones
are
numerous
the
large
objects
on
the
pedestals
come
in
for
a
share
of
wonder
they
are
adorned
with
names
of
wondrous
length
and
and
stories
of
horror
izcozauhqui
the
fire
of
the
sun
is
in
ugly
red
and
yellow
clay
huitzilopoxtli
the
god
of
war
a
black
clay
image
equally
ugly
a
clay
urn
with
carved
faces
flowers
and
fruits
on
the
outside
is
called
the
funeral
urn
the
goddess
of
death
is
an
image
some
fifty
inches
in
height
with
large
round
eyes
formed
of
bone
and
outstretched
hands
of
the
same
material
her
skirts
are
formed
of
serpents
and
her
head
is
a
skull
large
brown
earthen
jars
said
once
to
have
held
sacred
fires
are
among
the
collection
it
may
be
historically
correct
and
all
the
horrible
tales
connected
with
these
things
true
but
the
more
one
looks
the
less
probable
it
seems
and
after
all
they
may
have
been
innocent
statues
and
flower
vases
used
by
this
people
in
former
days
it
is
just
as
likely
and
easier
to
be
believed
for
how
can
it
be
asserted
when
they
are
unearthed
after
centuries
that
they
were
used
for
any
special
purpose
of
course
the
more
sensational
the
story
the
better
for
print
but
it
is
much
easier
to
believe
they
were
only
harmless
objects
in
some
park
or
flower
garden
history
tells
us
the
aztecs
knew
no
alphabet
and
used
in
place
certain
signs
or
figures
for
every
subject
history
religion
feasts
wars
famines
and
even
poetry
the
art
of
writing
in
this
manner
was
taught
by
the
priests
and
handed
down
from
father
to
son
painters
had
to
be
frequently
called
to
decipher
the
documents
and
were
treated
with
the
highest
consideration
by
the
nobility
the
manuscript
employed
was
made
of
maguey
and
other
plants
and
of
skins
the
spanish
destroyed
the
majority
of
these
manuscripts
which
would
have
been
of
great
value
if
preserved
a
few
are
now
in
the
museum
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
they
are
horrid
the
colors
they
used
in
painting
are
nearly
always
indelible
and
very
bright
one
of
the
paintings
shows
a
mountain
popocatepetl
and
to
the
left
the
city
of
mexico
entirely
surrounded
by
water
a
fifty
foot
maguey
paper
painted
in
black
contains
the
history
of
the
aztecs
how
they
left
an
island
which
held
a
temple
and
came
to
mexico
establishing
the
city
with
all
the
principal
events
which
befell
them
in
their
wanderings
the
battle
of
noche
triste
and
the
advent
of
the
spanish
are
carefully
portrayed
this
is
one
of
the
famous
picture
writings
which
are
too
tiresome
to
enumerate
further
the
feather
shield
which
belonged
to
montezuma
is
in
a
frame
in
the
same
room
with
the
picture
writing
it
is
an
old
faded
thing
and
hangs
too
far
away
to
be
seen
well
it
was
among
the
curiosities
given
by
cortes
to
the
emperor
charles
he
in
turn
presented
it
to
the
museum
of
vienna
where
it
remained
until
maximilian
restored
it
to
mexico
one
room
is
devoted
to
the
display
of
mexican
marbles
stones
ores
etc
another
has
petrified
snakes
wood
human
and
animal
bones
cow
horns
measuring
seven
feet
from
tip
to
tip
were
excavated
somewhere
near
mexico
elephant
jaws
and
tusks
which
treble
the
size
of
those
sported
by
the
late
lamented
jumbo
are
also
from
the
historic
mysterious
earth
of
mexico
among
the
many
other
things
were
noticed
human
bones
protruding
through
a
rock
and
a
turtle
shell
which
if
opened
would
make
a
carpet
for
a
grand
salon
snakes
lizards
fish
and
crabs
of
all
kinds
fill
one
good
sized
room
divided
in
the
center
by
stuffed
alligators
swordfish
crocodiles
and
boa
constrictors
this
opens
into
another
department
and
here
you
meet
the
mexican
dudes
occasionally
there
are
few
collections
of
birds
to
equal
this
added
to
their
own
numerous
beautiful
and
rare
birds
are
specimens
from
all
parts
of
the
world
the
work
is
especially
fine
and
the
birds
and
fowls
appear
as
if
in
life
one
thing
to
be
regretted
is
they
have
no
butterflies
in
all
the
museum
they
have
but
one
small
case
and
they
are
the
beauties
which
come
from
brazil
the
collection
of
beetles
is
somewhat
larger
but
still
is
nothing
remarkable
monstrosities
are
quite
plenty
one
little
calf
has
one
head
one
large
eye
in
the
center
of
its
forehead
and
two
perfect
bodies
another
has
one
perfect
body
and
two
heads
two
pheasants
are
fastened
together
like
the
siamese
twins
dogs
cats
chickens
and
even
babies
come
in
for
their
share
of
doubling
up
into
all
kinds
of
queer
shapes
monkeys
baboons
gorillas
and
a
dilapidated
elephant
and
giraffe
finish
this
interesting
quarter
the
court
of
the
museum
is
planted
with
beautiful
flowers
and
trees
large
idols
were
once
standing
there
but
they
have
been
moved
inside
of
the
building
opposite
the
entrance
the
idols
can
lay
no
claim
to
beauty
and
are
anything
but
interesting
except
to
people
who
have
a
wonderful
amount
of
faith
and
a
capacity
to
believe
a
wild
imagination
scientific
gentlemen
with
long
faces
and
one
gaze
at
the
images
and
translate
or
at
least
pretend
to
the
hieroglyphics
which
cover
them
we
would
not
think
for
a
moment
of
putting
an
opinion
against
one
held
by
wise
men
since
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
we
would
not
like
to
say
bernal
diaz
had
an
object
in
making
the
indians
as
black
as
possible
but
we
would
like
to
gently
hint
our
little
observations
the
sacrificial
stone
where
they
claim
fifty
thousand
people
have
been
sacrificed
looks
little
as
if
intended
for
that
bloody
purpose
the
stone
is
perfectly
round
between
four
and
six
feet
across
and
about
two
feet
in
thickness
on
the
upper
side
is
sculptured
the
image
of
the
sun
or
moon
and
on
the
sides
are
groups
of
men
fifteen
in
number
and
fifteen
separate
groups
certain
hieroglyphics
accompany
each
group
the
work
is
fine
and
must
have
been
done
with
great
care
and
patience
by
a
master
hand
marring
the
top
is
a
rudely
cut
hole
with
a
shallow
groove
running
to
the
edge
if
these
people
were
making
a
sacrificial
stone
would
they
have
cut
fine
figures
requiring
care
and
time
and
then
spoil
them
by
cutting
out
a
big
hole
would
not
the
basin
have
been
cut
out
finely
and
the
carvings
made
to
fit
i
may
be
lacking
in
knowledge
and
faith
but
i
have
tried
to
believe
have
gazed
on
the
stone
with
the
thought
history
says
the
blood
of
fifty
thousand
human
beings
has
dripped
down
over
that
stone
but
proofs
assert
themselves
and
the
poor
scandalized
thing
seems
to
hold
up
every
side
and
the
ugly
marring
of
its
beauty
and
reply
now
do
i
look
as
if
i
was
made
for
that
purpose
though
believing
it
was
nothing
more
than
an
innocent
aztec
calendar
we
will
repeat
the
sensational
legend
that
covers
it
with
a
bloody
cloak
there
existed
an
aztec
order
which
worshiped
the
sun
and
on
this
stone
they
sacrificed
human
beings
calling
them
the
messenger
to
the
sun
the
messenger
who
was
always
a
prisoner
was
painted
half
red
and
half
white
even
his
face
was
divided
in
this
manner
a
white
plume
was
glued
to
his
head
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
gaily
trimmed
and
in
the
other
a
shield
with
cotton
on
it
and
on
his
back
was
a
small
bundle
of
different
articles
music
was
played
as
he
ascended
the
stairway
to
the
temple
there
he
was
greeted
by
some
high
priest
who
commanded
him
to
go
to
the
sun
present
the
articles
he
carried
and
deliver
messages
they
sent
finally
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
turned
toward
the
sun
and
in
a
loud
voice
proclaimed
what
was
told
him
then
they
took
away
his
bundles
and
cut
his
throat
drenching
the
sun
on
the
stone
and
filling
the
bowl
with
his
blood
when
the
blood
ceased
to
flow
the
heart
was
cut
out
and
held
aloft
to
the
sun
until
cold
then
the
message
was
delivered
it
is
said
the
aztec
calendar
was
carved
in
and
its
inauguration
was
celebrated
with
fearful
sacrifices
but
the
conquering
cortes
had
it
pulled
down
and
it
remained
buried
until
lowering
the
grade
of
the
ancient
pavement
in
when
it
was
built
in
the
southwestern
tower
of
the
cathedral
there
it
remained
until
about
a
year
ago
when
it
was
removed
to
the
museum
where
it
now
occupies
a
prominent
position
the
sad
indian
a
statue
because
it
was
unearthed
on
a
street
of
that
name
is
a
fellow
and
compels
one
admiration
despite
his
broad
nose
and
ugly
features
so
far
i
have
heard
no
tales
connected
with
him
but
the
wiseacre
shakes
his
head
solemnly
and
replies
hundreds
of
human
beings
were
sacrificed
on
his
account
but
the
history
has
escaped
my
memory
meanwhile
the
old
fellow
sits
there
with
folded
hands
and
a
comical
expression
on
his
face
thinking
probably
of
the
duties
which
he
once
performed
which
were
undoubtedly
holding
a
lamp
or
a
flag
as
the
hole
through
the
folded
hands
and
between
the
feet
directly
beneath
proves
it
is
quite
interesting
to
roam
around
and
examine
this
broad
face
and
that
slim
one
from
those
of
mammoth
size
to
ones
the
size
of
hand
we
grow
to
like
the
queer
objects
which
certainly
formed
some
part
in
the
lives
of
those
strange
people
who
lived
and
died
centuries
before
us
in
one
corner
locked
up
in
a
cell
by
itself
is
the
coach
of
maximilian
and
carlotta
it
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
and
is
similar
in
construction
and
finish
to
that
used
on
state
occasions
by
the
czar
of
russia
the
coach
was
a
present
to
carlotta
from
napoleon
ii
it
is
so
fine
that
it
is
difficult
to
give
a
description
of
it
the
royal
coat
of
arms
is
on
every
available
spot
on
the
doors
and
above
wrought
in
gold
and
embroidered
in
gold
on
the
crimson
velvet
which
covers
the
driver
seat
the
entire
coach
is
gold
and
crimson
except
for
the
inside
which
is
heavy
white
silk
cords
fringe
and
tassels
of
the
same
gold
cherubs
the
size
of
a
baby
finish
each
corner
the
carriage
was
drawn
by
eight
pure
white
horses
or
the
same
number
of
coal
black
ones
and
as
it
swept
down
the
grand
passes
to
superb
chapultepec
holding
its
royal
owners
it
must
have
been
a
sight
fit
for
kings
but
it
stands
a
silent
memento
of
a
murdered
young
emperor
and
a
blighted
empress
all
the
men
employed
at
the
museum
are
disabled
soldiers
and
it
speaks
well
of
the
government
to
give
them
this
employment
they
seem
to
rightly
belong
in
among
this
queer
stuff
for
it
would
take
half
a
dozen
of
them
to
make
a
whole
man
the
museum
is
open
only
from
ten
to
twelve
and
is
free
to
all
but
our
tourists
are
even
now
standing
on
the
outside
wondering
if
they
have
not
fasted
enough
to
do
penance
for
all
the
sins
ever
committed
and
if
they
will
get
much
else
than
frijoles
rice
and
red
peppers
for
dinner
or
more
properly
speaking
breakfast
we
know
just
what
they
will
visit
this
afternoon
and
if
you
care
to
see
it
also
we
will
try
in
our
humble
way
to
show
you
around
chapter
x
historic
tombs
and
lonely
graves
how
much
i
would
like
to
paint
the
beauties
of
mexico
in
colors
so
faithful
that
the
people
in
the
states
could
see
what
they
are
losing
by
not
coming
here
how
i
would
like
to
show
you
the
green
valley
where
the
heat
of
summer
and
blast
of
winter
never
dare
approach
where
every
foot
of
ground
recalls
wonderful
historical
events
extinct
races
of
men
and
animals
and
civilization
older
by
far
than
the
pyramids
then
would
i
take
you
from
the
to
the
mountain
where
we
descend
into
deep
canons
that
compare
in
their
strange
beauty
with
any
in
the
world
the
queer
separation
of
the
earth
not
more
than
feet
from
edge
to
edge
of
precipice
but
feet
deep
more
wonderful
still
is
the
sight
when
the
rainy
season
fills
these
gorges
with
a
mad
roaring
torrent
then
would
i
lead
you
to
the
edge
of
some
bluff
that
outrivals
the
palisades
and
let
you
look
down
the
dizzy
heights
feet
to
the
green
meadows
the
blooming
orchards
the
acres
of
pulque
plant
the
little
homes
that
nestle
at
the
foot
of
this
strange
wall
then
further
up
into
the
mountains
you
could
see
glaciers
grander
it
is
claimed
than
any
found
in
the
alps
here
are
buried
cities
older
than
pompeii
sculptures
thousands
of
years
old
hieroglyphics
for
the
wise
to
study
and
everywhere
the
picturesque
people
in
their
garb
and
manners
of
centuries
ago
and
all
this
within
a
day
travel
from
the
city
surely
in
all
the
world
there
is
none
other
such
wonderful
natural
museum
business
men
who
wish
to
rest
from
their
labors
find
perfect
quiet
in
this
paradise
all
cares
vanish
some
strange
magic
seems
to
rob
one
of
all
care
of
every
desire
to
hurry
railways
furnish
comfortable
and
safe
transportation
the
people
are
attentive
and
polite
and
as
many
comforts
are
attainable
as
at
any
other
place
away
from
the
states
people
who
have
any
desire
to
see
mexico
in
all
its
splendor
should
come
soon
for
civilization
curse
or
blessing
whichever
it
may
be
has
surely
set
a
firm
foot
here
and
in
a
few
years
yielding
to
its
influence
all
will
be
changed
already
the
senora
has
changed
the
lovely
graceful
mantilla
for
stiff
ugly
bonnets
and
hats
the
poor
indian
woman
is
replacing
the
fascinating
reboza
with
a
horrid
shawl
the
indian
man
is
changing
sandals
for
torturing
shoes
and
the
cool
linen
pantaloons
and
serape
for
american
pantaloons
and
coat
civilization
and
its
twin
sister
style
have
caught
them
in
their
grasp
and
unless
you
come
soon
mexico
will
cease
to
be
attractive
except
as
a
new
california
there
is
one
thing
i
hope
will
ever
remain
and
that
is
the
graveyard
of
san
fernando
where
most
of
the
illustrious
dead
of
mexico
are
entombed
but
it
is
doubtful
as
a
little
beyond
are
the
fine
houses
of
the
foreign
representatives
and
the
houses
are
crowding
up
to
the
gate
of
this
dead
city
as
though
trying
to
push
it
out
of
existence
an
old
cathedral
faced
by
a
green
plaza
rears
its
head
at
one
side
near
the
massive
iron
gates
which
the
keeper
sitting
just
within
its
portals
swings
open
and
admits
one
with
a
welcome
that
is
surprising
all
around
are
people
buried
in
the
walls
the
plates
are
decorated
in
all
manner
of
ways
some
have
a
little
niche
which
hold
the
image
of
the
virgin
and
several
candles
others
are
hung
with
wreaths
and
some
with
crepe
the
majority
have
places
to
hold
candles
which
are
burnt
there
on
certain
days
the
nearest
tomb
to
the
gate
holds
the
remains
of
a
young
girl
who
died
quite
suddenly
on
the
day
she
was
to
be
married
just
an
hour
before
the
time
appointed
near
here
is
erected
a
fine
shaft
in
honor
of
general
ignacio
comonfort
who
was
a
president
once
but
was
shot
at
molino
de
toria
november
by
the
americans
several
yards
beyond
is
a
plain
brown
stone
built
in
an
oblong
box
shape
with
a
large
stone
cross
in
the
center
it
is
and
worn
and
looks
to
be
centuries
old
all
the
information
it
gives
a
stranger
is
in
two
large
initials
rudely
cut
on
the
side
no
date
or
usual
verse
of
regret
from
loving
friends
is
inscribed
and
somehow
a
thrill
of
pity
strikes
one
for
as
it
seems
to
be
the
only
grave
in
all
that
quiet
city
that
bears
no
mark
of
loving
hands
i
took
my
penknife
and
hastily
cut
in
the
soft
stone
when
the
mexican
friend
who
had
during
this
time
been
engaged
with
the
gateman
getting
some
information
came
up
he
said
the
grave
you
stand
beside
is
that
of
general
tomas
mejia
who
was
shot
with
maximilian
and
here
is
the
tomb
of
the
other
it
was
similar
in
shape
to
general
mejia
but
some
kind
hand
had
hung
wreaths
on
the
cross
general
miguel
miramon
was
president
of
the
republic
before
maximilian
he
was
a
brave
and
good
man
and
the
emperor
well
knew
his
worth
when
they
stood
up
to
be
shot
maximilian
in
the
center
mejia
on
the
right
and
miramon
on
the
left
the
center
of
course
being
considered
the
place
of
honor
maximilian
touching
miramon
on
the
shoulder
said
you
are
more
worthy
this
place
than
i
and
he
exchanged
places
and
so
they
died
the
tomb
of
benito
juarez
the
indian
president
is
the
finest
in
the
place
it
is
a
long
marble
tomb
on
it
lies
the
body
of
juarez
partly
covered
with
a
mantle
sitting
at
his
head
with
her
hands
on
his
heart
is
a
beautiful
woman
representative
of
the
nation
mourning
for
its
much
beloved
president
the
whole
is
a
perfect
study
and
was
designed
and
executed
by
a
mexican
the
life
of
juarez
is
a
very
romantic
one
he
is
familiarly
known
as
the
lincoln
of
mexico
he
was
born
in
the
state
of
oaxaca
and
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
was
a
indian
and
could
not
even
speak
the
spanish
language
however
he
tried
to
improve
his
time
and
in
he
was
governor
of
his
native
state
he
went
to
new
orleans
on
being
banished
by
santa
anna
but
returned
to
mexico
in
and
became
president
of
the
court
of
justice
when
comonfort
was
overthrown
by
the
clerical
party
juarez
set
himself
up
at
vera
cruz
as
constitutional
president
of
the
republic
the
united
states
recognized
him
as
such
and
he
successfully
fought
the
priesthood
and
confiscated
all
the
church
property
when
maximilian
ascended
the
throne
juarez
sent
his
family
to
new
orleans
but
he
remained
here
until
compelled
to
cross
the
frontier
the
united
states
which
had
always
favored
juarez
interfered
in
his
behalf
at
the
termination
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
maximilian
was
betrayed
and
shot
and
juarez
was
in
and
died
in
office
june
he
has
a
daughter
who
is
married
and
living
in
mexico
in
greater
style
than
the
president
she
resembles
her
father
a
story
is
told
of
juarez
that
is
new
at
the
very
least
he
had
plenty
of
enemies
especially
among
the
church
party
one
day
he
sent
a
band
out
to
capture
an
outlaw
who
notwithstanding
his
enemies
stood
well
with
the
clergy
the
bandit
was
met
on
the
highway
and
shot
before
he
could
utter
a
prayer
they
said
his
soul
was
lost
and
juarez
was
to
blame
when
he
was
dying
it
was
endeavored
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
and
the
people
were
in
ignorance
of
his
fatal
illness
until
one
morning
they
saw
a
notice
posted
on
street
corners
which
read
in
this
style

open
now
to

they
no

register
dead

among
many
other
things
mexico
can
boast
of
is
the
public
library
it
is
situated
on
calle

in
the
old

the
little

plot
in

is
filled
with
rare
plants
and
fountains
the
face
of
the
church
is
a
mass
of
wondrous
carvings
and
the
vestibule
is
a
crown
of
splendid
architecture
directly
over
the
door
leading
into
the
room
is
the
world
on
one
side
brass
hands
and
figures
tell
the
hour
standing
on
one
foot
on
top
of
it
is
a
figure
of
time
in
bronze
the
attitude
the
scythe
over
the
shoulder
the
expression
on
the
face
the
long
flowing

are
perfect
opposite

and
at
the

end
of
the

and
in
the

a
large

with
a

in

marked
science
the
books
are
catalogued
under
the
heads
of
philosophy
history
fiction
and
are
placed
in
cases
alphabetically
they
are
in
all
languages
and
many
of
them
are
very
ancient
some
are
on
parchment
and
in

the
library
has
catalogued
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
volumes
and
owns
many
besides
that
are
not
yet
sorted
and
arranged
it
is
open
from
to
and
is
equally
free
to
all
it
is
well
patronized
by
men
but
it
is
safe
to
say
no
woman
has
ever
read
a
book
inside
its
walls
the
only
women
who
ever
enter
are
tourists
the
books
are
not
permitted
to
go
outside
the
building
a
man
gets
a
printed
card
on
it
he
writes
the
title
number
and
case
of
his
book
and
when
the
hour
comes
to
close
he
lays
the
book
on
the
desk
of
the
janitor
and
gives
his
card
to
the
superintendent
many
of
the
ancient
books
were
taken
at
the
time
of
the
confiscation
of
the
monasteries
and
convents
the
carnival
passed
off
very
quietly
as
i
said
before
mexico
is
becoming
civilized
and
doing
away
with
many
ancient
and
beautiful
customs
in
former
years
every
day
on
carnival
week
the
paseo
was
crowded
with
masked
men
and
women
in
historic
and
comic
garb
and
battles
were
fought
with
empty
and
queerly
constructed
things
for
the
same
purpose
this
year
every
person
went
but
only
the
fewest
number
were
masked
some
few
among
the
lower
class
threw
beyond
this
all
was
quiet
it
has
also
been
the
custom
to
give
and
masked
balls
in
all
the
theaters
public
balls
were
held
and
the
clubs
gave
private
receptions
the
french
club
had
their
rooms
nicely
decorated
and
the
best
people
attended
dressed
in
the
finest
and
most
original
costumes
perhaps
the
most
striking
one
was
a
creamy
satin
embroidered
with
red
roses
and
covered
with
natural
butterflies
of
gorgeous
and
brilliant
hue
the
young
ladies
all
wore
their
dresses
just
reaching
their
knees
and
the
fancy
boots
displayed
were
something
marvelous
satin
of
all
shades
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
and
trimmed
with
flowers
one
couple
who
have
been
lately
engaged
were
dressed
alike
the
girl
wore
a
short
dress
of
white
satin
profusely
trimmed
with
pompons
of
white
fur
white
satin
boots
trimmed
the
same
way
and
over
her
loose
hair
of
marvelous
length
and
thickness
was
a
point
lace
veil
the
groom
wore
satin
knee
breeches
short
coat
high
hat
and
boots
all
covered
with
the
white
fur
pompons
they
were
accompanied
by
the
mother
in
a
brocade
crimson
velvet
on
a
canary
background
and
rich
yellow
lace
and
en
train
and
the
father
in
common
dress
suit
the
mexican
boys
never
appeared
better
than
in
the
grand
old
dregs
of
former
days
mostly
crimson
velvet
and
satin
were
affected
showing
to
an
advantage
their
superb
eyes
and
complexion
the
women
were
remarkable
for
their
homeliness
a
grand
supper
of
courses
was
served
and
more
wine
champagne
and
cigarettes
consumed
than
would
be
done
at
forty
receptions
in
the
east
now
having
shown
you
now
they
do
at
private
balls
where
only
the
are
permitted
to
attend
would
you
like
to
don
a
mask
and
domino
and
sit
with
these
very
same
people
in
the
boxes
at
the
theaters
and
watch
the
promiscuous
crowd
beneath
it
is
not
a
select
crowd
by
any
means
but
one
composed
of
the
lowest
in
the
land
yet
men
take
their
wives
sisters
and
friends
masked
that
they
may
watch
through
opera
glasses
this
wonderful
sight
and
wives
and
sweethearts
get
friends
to
take
them
that
they
unseen
may
see
if
husband
or
lover
takes
part
in
the
revel
for
the
men
are
of
the
best
and
wealthiest
families
at
the
doors
are
flung
open
and
people
come
in
slowly
the
two
bands
play
alternately
the
spanish
danza
and
the
waltz
the
women
come
in
dressed
in
all
the
styles
ever
invented
one
beautiful
woman
wore
a
blue
satin
dress
embroidered
with
pink
rose
buds
another
wore
blue
trimmed
with
beaded
lace
which
glittered
like
hundreds
of
diamonds
in
the
two
came
together
one
in
black
the
other
in
crimson
velvet
profusely
and
gayly
embroidered
some
were
dressed
after
the
style
of
the
male
dudes
of
the
states
but
the
majority
wore
nothing
but
a
outfit
dotted
with
silver
or
gold
spangles
according
to
the
color
the
men
with
the
exception
of
a
half
dozen
wore
their
common
suits
and
never
removed
their
hats
nearly
all
the
women
wore
their
hair
short
which
they
had
powdered
at
first
they
wore
masks
but
in
a
short
time
they
were
removed
and
by
everybody
was
drunk
when
a
man
refused
to
dance
with
a
woman
a
fight
was
the
result
and
everybody
would
quit
dancing
until
it
was
settled
one
year
fifteen
men
were
killed
during
the
week
it
lasted
this
year
but
one
has
met
his
death
the
actions
and
dancing
of
this
mob
will
bear
no
description
and
at
the
performance
ended
the
manager
of
the
national
theater
has
promised
that
his
house
shall
never
be
used
for
this
purpose
again
the
carnival
was
celebrated
in
fine
style
at
amecameca
right
at
the
foot
of
the
white
lady
indians
came
from
all
parts
of
the
country
and
paraded
the
entire
week
around
the
church
and
temple
with
lighted
candles
at
puebla
they
had
egg
battles
and
in
all
little
places
the
feast
was
carried
on
as
in
former
days
sights
in
the
city
have
begun
to
assume
a
familiar
look
although
one
never
tires
of
them
and
i
begin
to
think
of
moving
elsewhere
the
buried
city
is
slowly
being
unearthed
at
san
juan
already
they
have
brought
to
light
a
house
of
magnificent
size
and
finish
and
in
a
few
days
it
will
be
well
worth
a
visit
tourists
have
been
going
down
regularly
but
beyond
a
few
men
at
work
little
was
to
be
seen
what
they
missed
they
furnished
with
their
imagination
as
did
also
some
correspondents
who
would
not
wait
to
get
legitimate
news
the
mint
which
is
situated
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
is
turning
out
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
silver
per
day
the
first
coin
struck
was
in
and
in
three
hundred
years
they
coined
the
men
employed
get
from
one
to
two
dollars
a
day
in
a
month
from
now
the
government
is
going
to
make
fifteen
million
cents
gold
coin
although
in
use
here
is
not
made
more
than
once
a
month
the
arsenal
is
in
a
fine
old
building
directly
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
mint
all
departments
are
not
running
for
the
lack
of
money
so
they
say
they
make
but
three
hundred
and
fifty
entire
guns
a
day
but
have
one
million
dollars
worth
in
stock
in
one
room
they
have
a
fine
collection
of
arms
such
as
are
used
by
every
nation
in
the
world
the
iron
and
wood
used
is
mexican
the
latter
a
superb
walnut
which
requires
no
oil
or
varnish
the
people
here
employed
get
from
one
real
twelve
and
a
half
cents
to
two
dollars
a
day
the
highest
that
is
paid
the
tourists
who
have
such
a
mania
for
mementos
have
brought
disgrace
on
themselves
and
others
also
the
governor
has
been
very
kind
and
has
thrown
open
the
embassadors
hall
without
reserve
for
their
inspection
it
is
a
beautiful
place
containing
paintings
of
washington
juarez
hidalgo
and
other
illustrious
men
the
chandeliers
hung
with
brilliant
pendants
terra
cotta
and
alabaster
vases
and
handsome
clocks
were
once
the
property
of
maximilian
at
either
end
of
the
long
hall
are
crimson
velvet
and
thrones
where
the
president
receives
his
guests
some
trophy
fiend
most
probably
some
girl
with
the
thought
of
a
crazy
patch
cut
a
large
piece
out
of
one
of
these
damask
curtains
consequently
the
governor
has
issued
orders
that
no
visitors
shall
be
admitted
and
the
yankees
have
gone
down
one
notch
further
in
the
scale
where
they
already
by
their
own
conduct
hold
a
low
position
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
those
who
come
in
the
future
may
act
so
that
no
more
shame
will
fall

us

anguish
love
and
marriage
form
the
basis
of
every
plot
play
comedy
tragedy
story
and
let
it
be
whispered
swell
the
purse
with
breach
of
promise
and
divorce
case
fees
yet
it
blooms
with
a
beauty
in
every
clime
and
as
there
is
no
land
in
all
the
world
more
suitable
for
romance
than
mexico
it
is
pertinent
to
show
how
love
is
planted
cultivated
and
reaped
in
this
paradise
so
as
to
let
our
single
readers
in
the
states
compare
the
system
here
with
home
customs
and
benefit
thereby
whether
by
making
good
use
of
their
own
free
style
or
cultivating
a
new
those
interested
must
decide
mexicans
may
be
slow
in
many
things
but
not
slow
in
love
the
laws
of
mexico
claim
girls
at
twelve
and
boys
at
thirteen
years
are
eligible
to
marriage
and
it
is
not
an
unusual
sight
to
see
a
woman
who
looks
no
more
than
a
as
children
the
mexicans
are
rather
pretty
but
when
a
girl
passes
twenty
she
gets
avoirdupois
and
at
thirty
she
sports
a
mustache
and
galways
that
would
cause
young
bachelors
in
the
states
to
turn
green
with
envy
the
men
on
the
contrary
are
slim
and
wiry
and
do
not
boast
of
their
hirsute
charms
especially
when
in
company
with
women
as
they
have
little
desire
to
call
attention
to
the
contrast
and
the
finds
other
means
of
display
than
stroking
and
twisting
an
imaginary
mustache
yet
this
exchange
of
charms
interferes
in
no
way
with
and
the
young
man
wafts
sweet
kisses
from
his
finger
tips
to
the
fair
no
dark
damsel
and
enjoys
it
as
much
as
if
that
black
silky
down
on
her
lip
were
fringing
the
gateway
to
his
stomach
boys
and
girls
even
in
babyhood
are
not
permitted
to
be
together
before
very
long
they
compel
their
eyes
to
speak
the
love
their
lips
dare
not
tell
and
with
a
little
practice
it
is
surprising
how
much
they
can
say
and
how
cold
and
insipid
sound
words
of
the
same
meaning
in
comparison
all
the
courting
is
done
on
the
street
when
evening
kindly
lends
its
sheltering
cloak
even
though
the
moon
smiles
at
the
many
she
is
witnessing
the
girl
opens
her
casement
window
and
with
guitar
in
her
hand
or
dreamily
watching
the
stars
she
awaits
her
lover
if
her
room
is
on
the
ground
floor
she
is
in
paradise
for
then
they
can
converse
he
can
even
touch
her
hand
through
the
bars
but
if
she
is
consigned
to
a
room
above
she
steps
out
on
the
balcony
if
the
distance
is
not
too
great
they
can
still
converse
but
otherwise
with
the
aid
of
pencil
paper
and
tiny
cord
they
manage
to
spend
the
evening
blissfully
without
burning
papa
coal
and
gas
and
staying
up
until
unseemly
hours
the
lovers
are
unmindful
of
the
people
who
pass
and
repass
and
the
policeman
never
even
thinks
of
telling
the
young
man
to
move
on
if
the
house
is
secluded
the
lover
tells
his
devotion
in
musical
strains
night
is
not
only
devoted
to
but
in
the
broad
light
of
day
the
young
man
will
stand
across
the
street
and
from
the
partly
opened
casement
of
the
fair
one
are
visible
a
hand
and
a
nose
of
course
she
has
full
view
but
that
is
all
that
can
be
seen
of
her
with
the
hand
they
converse
in
deaf
and
dumb
language
which
added
to
their
own
signs
makes
a
large
dictionary
it
is
not
likely
there
exists
a
mexican
who
is
not
an
adept
in
the
sign
language
courting
is
too
vulgar
a
word
for
them
so
they
call
it
translated
in
english
playing
the
bear
you
would
naturally
wonder
how
a
girl
who
never
leaves
her
or
chaperon
side
who
never
goes
to
parties
who
is
watched
like
a
condemned
murderess
would
ever
get
a
lover
but
notwithstanding
all
this
strictness
they
number
less
old
maids
and
more
admirers
than
their
sisters
in
the
states
perhaps
while
out
driving
at
the
theater
or
they
see
a
man
they
think
they
will
like
he
is
similarly
impressed
he
follows
his
one
home
and
she
knows
enough
to
be
on
the
balcony
awaiting
his
arrival
with
the
shades
of
night
he
may
play
the
bear
with
her
for
a
year
and
she
not
know
his
name
he
has
the
advantage
for
he
can
find
out
everything
about
her
family
and
thereby
determine
whether
she
is
a
desirable
bride
or
not
sometimes
they
play
the
bear
for
from
seven
to
fifteen
years
that
is
if
the
parents
are
very
wealthy
and
even
then
not
get
the
girl
for
with
all
their
passionate
love
they
number
many
flirts
often
one
girl
will
have
two
or
more
playing
the
bear
at
the
same
time
if
they
chance
to
meet
they
inquire
fiercely
whom
are
you
after
if
the
answer
demonstrates
the
same
girl
one
will
request
the
other
to
step
aside
if
he
refuses
a
duel
follows
after
that
the
girl
is
bound
by
the
custom
of
her
country
to
relinquish
both
if
a
brother
or
father
discovers
a
bear
the
latter
must
submit
to
a
thrashing
from
their
hands
if
he
still
desires
to
retain
the
girl
love
if
a
father
notices
the
attention
of
a
bear
and
looks
with
favor
upon
him
he
does
not
disturb
his
playing
when
he
concludes
he
has
served
long
enough
he
is
invited
into
the
house
this
means
the
same
as
if
he
had
asked
her
hand
in
marriage
and
has
been
accepted
he
is
the
intended
husband
but
never
for
a
moment
is
he
alone
with
his
he
may
aspire
to
take
the
driver
place
sometimes
or
to
take
the
entire
family
to
the
theater
a
young
american
had
been
received
in
great
favor
by
a
spanish
family
probably
the
old
man
thought
he
would
like
an
american
for
a
however
young
america
was
not
going
to
waste
any
time
sitting
in
the
house
with
the
old
folks
so
he
politely
requested
the
object
of
his
admiration
to
go
to
the
italian
opera
she
graciously
accepted
when
he
went
to
the
house
he
found
not
only
his
lady
love
but
the
entire
family
prepared
to
accompany
him
the
deed
was
done
he
could
not
back
out
and
for
the
privilege
of
talking
to
the
mother
with
the
daughter
sitting
on
the
other
side
casting
glances
from
her
splendid
eyes
he
paid
dollars
he
was
disgusted
and
accordingly
gave
up
his
chance
of
being
a
member
of
a
mexican
family
if
a
man
gets
impatient
and
feels
like
becoming
responsible
for
the
price
of
his
sweetheart
bonnets
he
asks
the
father
if
he
is
rejected
he
can
go
to
a
public
official
swear
out
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
his
and
the
girl
happiness
is
ruined
by
the
heartlessness
he
then
secures
a
warrant
which
gives
him
the
privilege
of
taking
the
girl
away
bodily
from
the
home
of
her
parents
this
is
a
mexican
elopement
if
on
the
other
hand
he
is
accepted
the
is
named
and
agreements
are
drawn
up
as
to
how
much
will
be
the
daughter
portion
at
the
death
of
her
parents
before
that
period
she
receives
nothing
the
intended
husband
furnishes
the
wedding
outfit
and
all
the
wearing
apparel
she
has
been
using
is
returned
to
her
parents
she
has
absolutely
nothing
the
groom
buys
the
customary
outfit
white
satin
boots
white
dress
and
veil
a
mexican
wedding
is
different
from
any
other
in
the
world
first
a
civil
marriage
is
performed
by
a
public
official
this
by
law
makes
the
children
of
that
couple
legitimate
and
lawful
inheritors
of
their
parents
property
this
is
recorded
and
in
a
few
days
the
day
following
or
a
month
after
just
as
desired
the
marriage
is
consummated
in
the
church
before
this
ceremony
the
bride
and
groom
are
no
more
allowed
alone
together
than
when
playing
the
bear
at
a
wedding
the
other
day
the
church
was
decorated
with
five
hundred
dollars
worth
of
white
roses
the
amount
can
be
estimated
when
it
is
stated
roses
cost
but
four
reals
fifty
cents
per
thousand
their
delicate
perfume
filled
the
grand
gloomy
old
edifice
which
was
lighted
by
thousands
of
large
and
small
wax
candles
carpet
was
laid
from
the
gate
into
the
church
and
when
the
bridal
party
marched
in
the
pipe
organ
and
band
burst
forth
in
one
joyous
strain
the
priest
clad
entirely
in
white
vestments
advanced
to
the
door
to
meet
them
followed
by
two
men
in
black
robes
carrying
different
articles
a
small
boy
in
red
skirt
and
lace
overdress
carrying
a
long
pole
topped
off
with
a
cross
the
bride
was
clad
in
white
silk
trimmed
with
beaded
lace
with
train
about
four
yards
long
dark
hair
and
waist
dressed
with
orange
blossoms
over
this
falling
down
to
her
feet
in
front
and
reaching
the
end
of
the
train
back
was
a

lace

magnificent
diamonds
were
the
ornaments
and
in
the
gloved
hands
was
a
she
entered
a
pew
near
the
door
with
her
mother
who
was
dressed
in
black
lace
on
one
side
and
her
father
on
the
other
after
answering
some
questions
they
stepped
out
and
the
groom
stood
beside
the
bride
with
groomsman
and
bridemaid
on
either
side
the
latter
dressed
in
dark
green
velvet
lace
and
bonnet
the
priest
read
a
long
while
and
then
addressing
the
girl
first
asked
her
many
questions
to
which
she
replied
si
senor
then
he
questioned
the
groom
likewise
afterward
he
handed
the
groom
a
diamond
ring
which
the
latter
placed
on
the
little
finger
of
the
left
hand
of
the
bride
the
priest
put
a
similar
ring
on
the
of
the
right
hand
of
the
groom
and
a
plain
wedding
ring
on
the
of
the
bride
right
hand
then
folding
the
two
ringed
hands
together
he
sprinkled
them
with
holy
water
and
crossed
them
repeatedly
the
band
played
yankee
doodle
and
the
bride
holding
on
to
an
embroidered
band
on
the
priest
arm
the
groom
doing
likewise
on
the
other
side
they
proceeded
up
to
the
altar
where
they
knelt
down
the
priest
blessed
them
sprinkled
them
with
holy
water
and
said
mass
for
them
the
band
playing
the
variations
of
yankee
doodle
a
man
in
black
robes
put
a
lace
scarf
over
the
head
of
the
bride
and
around
the
shoulders
of
the
groom
over
this
again
he
placed
a
silver
chain
symbolic
of
the
fact
that
they
were
bound
together
forever
nothing
could
separate
them
after
the
priest
finished
mass
he
blessed
and
sprinkled
them
once
more
then
from
a
plate
he
took
seventeen
gold
dollars
the
groom
had
furnished
and
emptied
them
into
his
hands
the
groom
in
turn
emptied
them
into
the
hand
of
his
bride
and
she
gave
them
to
the
priest
as
a
gift
to
the
church
and
a
token
that
they
will
always
sustain
protect
and
uphold
it
now
the
ceremony
which
always
lasts
two
to
four
hours
is
ended
and
the
newly
married
pair
go
into
an
adjoining
room
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
their
friends
the
marriage
festivities
are
often
kept
up
for
a
week
after
that
the
husband
claims
his
bride
and
right
jealously
does
he
guard
her
her
life
is
spent
in
seclusion
eating
drinking
sleeping
smoking
the
husband
is
desperately
jealous
and
the
wife
is
never
allowed
to
be
in
the
company
of
another
man
life
to
a
mexican
lady
in
an
view
is
not
worth
living
when
death
takes
one
away
the
dust
remains
buried
for
ten
years
if
the
husband
is
wealthy
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
bones
all
that
remains
in
this
country
are
lifted
placed
in
a
jar
and
taken
home

see
that
case
said
a
mexican
my
first
wife
is
in
that
even
to
her
fingernails
and
that
is
her
so
it
was
there
in
the
parlor
a
dismal
ornament
and
memento
mexican
carelessness
does
not
extend
to
the
saying
of
mass
a
man
had
three
daughters
and
each
was
to
inherit
for
this
reason
he
would
not
allow
them
to
marry
one

and
the
anniversary
of
her
death
was
celebrated
in
fine
style
high
mass
was
said
and
a
coffin
arranged
on
a
catafalque
feet
high
recalled
the
dead
woman
the
coffin
were
imported
from
paris
and
altogether
the
mass
cost

dying

mexicans
who
have
been
to
the
states
much
prefer
the
american
style
of
calling
on
ladies
but
it
is
not
likely
it
will
ever
be
the
custom
for
american
residents
here
have
adopted
the
mexican
style
for
their
daughters
and
most
ridiculous
and
affected
does
it
appear
american
boys
however
have
no
time
to
waste
on
such
manners
so
they
do
their
by
letters
and
go
back
to
the
states
for
their
brides
leaving
the
american
mammas
to
search
among
the
mexicans
for

and

as

many

as
well
represented
as
any
other
foreign
country
yankees
are
looked
on
favorably
by
some
of
the
better
and
more
educated
class
of
mexicans
but
others
still
retain
their
old
prejudices
however
one
can
hardly
blame
them
for
barring
a
few
the
american
colony
is
composed
of
what
is
not
considered
the
better
class
of
people
at
home
they
have
come
down
here
got
positions
away
above
their
standing
and
consequently
feel
their
importance
they
are
more
than
offensive
they
are
insulting
in
their
actions
and
language
toward
the
natives
and
endeavor
to
run
things
the
natives
offer
no
objections
to
others
coming
here
and
making
fortunes
in
their
land
but
they
have
lived
their
own
free
and
easy
life
and
they
do
not
propose
to
change
it
any
more
than
we
would
change
if
a
small
body
of
mexicans
would
settle
in
our
country
and
we
would
quickly
annihilate
them
if
they
would
offer
us
the
indignities
the
americans
subject
them
to
here
i
dread
the
return
and
reports
of
such
people
in
the
states
for
although
there
are
good
and
bad
here
the
mexicans
have
never
been
represented
correctly
before
leaving
home
i
was
repeatedly
advised
that
a
woman
was
not
safe
on
the
streets
of
mexico
that
thieves
and
murderers
awaited
one
at
every
corner
and
all
the
horrors
that
could
be
invented
were
poured
into
my
timid
ear
there
are
murders
committed
here
but
not
half
so
frequently
as
in
any
american
city
some
stealing
is
done
but
it
is
petty
work
there
are
no
wholesale
robberies
like
those
so
often
perpetrated
at
home
the
people
are
courteous
but
of
course
their
courtesy
differs
from
ours
and
the
women
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
are
safer
here
than
on
our
streets
where
it
is
supposed
everybody
has
the
advantage
of
education
and
civilization
if
one
goes
near
the
habitation
of
the
poor
in
the
suburbs
they
come
out
and
greet
you
like
a
long
absent
friend
they
extend
invitations
to
make
their
abode
your
home
and
offer
the
best
they
own
those
in
the
city
while
always
polite
and
kind
have
grown
more
worldly
wise
and
careful
the
people
who
give
the
natives
the
worst
name
are
those
who
treat
them
the
meanest
i
have
heard
men
who
received
some
kindness
address
the
donor
as
thief
scoundrel
and
many
times
worse
i
have
heard
american
women
address
their
faithful
servants
as
beasts
and
fools
one
woman
who
has
a
so
faithful
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
life
any
moment
for
his
little
charge
addressed
him
in
my
presence
as
you
dirty
brute
where
did
you
stay
so
long
they
are
very
quick
to
appreciate
a
kindness
and
are
sensitive
to
an
insult
speaking
of
honesty
they
say
the
aquadores
or
are
the
most
honest
fellows
in
the
city
they
have
a
company
and
if
any
one
is
even
suspected
of
stealing
he
is
prohibited
from
selling
any
more
water
at
intervals
all
over
the
city
are
large
basins
and
fountains
where
they
get
their
water
for
four
jars
two
journeys
as
they
carry
two
jars
at
once
they
receive
six
and
a
quarter
cents
or
one
real
twelve
and
a
half
cents
if
they
carry
it
their
dress
is
very
different
from
others
they
wear
pantaloons
and
shirt
like
an
american
and
a
large
leather
smock
which
not
only
saves
them
from
being
wet
but
prevents
the
jars
from
bruising
the
flesh
they
all
wear
caps
and
the
leather
band
of
the
jars
is
as
often
suspended
from
the
head
as
from
the
shoulders
americans
who
come
to
mexico
to
reside
should
take
out
identification
papers
the
first
thing
it
costs
but
little
and
saves
often
a
lot
of
trouble
people
when
arrested
have
little
chance
to
do
much
even
if
they
be
innocent
they
are
thrown
into
prison
and
allowed
to
remain
there
without
a
trial
for
often
a
year
and
it
is
said
a
mexican
prison
gains
nothing
in
comparison
with
libby
prison
of
war
fame
but
if
a
man
has
his
identification
papers
he
can
present
them
and
command
an
immediate
trial
and
it
is
given
there
is
an
american
now
lying
in
prison
here
for
shooting
a
mexican
woman
the
woman
was
only
shot
through
the
arm
and
yet
the
man
has
been
in
jail
without
even
a
change
of
clothing
for
over
a
year
he
is
in
a
deplorable
state
without
much
hope
of
it
being
bettered
the
american
consul
seems
to
have
a
disposition
to
help
his
countryman
he
has
been
here
but
a
month
and
his
first
work
deserves
praise
a
man
by
the
name
of
john
rivers
or
rodgers
shot
a
fellow
in
it
was
a
clear
case
but
the
main
witnesses
had
no
desire
to
lay
in
jail
as
the
law
requires
until
the
american
trial
came
up
so
they
fled
the
country
the
american
could
speak
no
spanish
his
trial
was
poorly
conducted
and
he
was
sentenced
to
be
executed
at
zocatagus
up
the
central
road
consul
porch
heard
of
the
case
he
studied
it
out
found
the
man
was
not
given
a
fair
trial
and
hastened
off
reaching
the
scene
of
execution
but
a
short
time
before
the
hour
appointed
but
in
time
at
least
to
postpone
the
tragedy
there
is
one
great
disadvantage
americans
suffer
from
and
that
is
the
government
sending
out
ministers
and
consuls
who
have
no
knowledge
of
the
language
in
the
country
to
which
they
go
it
would
be
a
mark
of
intelligence
if
they
would
make
a
law
like
that
in
some
countries
providing
that
no
man
could
represent
america
unless
he
had
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
foreign
tongue
with
which
he
would
have
to
deal
in
my
wanderings
around
the
city
i
found
a
street
on
which
there
are
no
business
houses
or
even
pulque
shops
nothing
but
coffin
manufacturers
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
you
see
in
every
door
men
and
boys
making
and
painting
all
kinds
and
sizes
of
coffins
the
dwelling
houses
are
old
and
dilapidated
and
the
street
narrow
and
dingy
here
the
men
work
day
after
day
and
never
whistle
talk
or
sing
as
they
go
at
their
hewing
painting
and
glueing
with
long
faces
as
if
they
were
driving
nails
into
their
own
coffins
i
soon
related
my
discovery
to
joaquin
miller
and
he
went
along
to
see
it
then
he
said
little
nell
you
are
a
second
columbus
you
have
discovered
a
street
that
has
no
like
in
the
world
and
i
have
been
over
the
world
twice
it
quite
fine
is
it
and
he
gave
a
hearty
laugh
of
course
there
may
be
other
streets
somewhere
just
the
same
we
could
find
no
name
for
our
new
treasure
so
we
simply
dubbed
it
coffin
street
i
am
sorry
i
have
no
picture
of
it
to
send
you
so
you
could
see
the
coffins
piled
up
to
the
ceiling
a
little
table
in
the
center
where
the
workman
puts
on
the
finishing
touches
after
which
they
are
placed
in
rows
against
the
building
by
the
and
silent
workers
to
await
a
purchaser
near
this
somber
thoroughfare
is
another
street
where
every
other
door
is
a
shoe
shop
the
one
between
being
a
many
of
the
shoemakers
have
their
shops
on
the
pavement
with
a
straw
mat
fastened
on
a
pole
to
keep
off
the
sun
here
he
sits
making
new
shoes
and
mending
old
ones
until
the
sun
goes
down
when
he
lowers
the
pole
and
taking
off
the
straw
mat
furnishes
a
bed
for
himself
in
some
corner
during
the
night
wealthy
americans
who
have
a
desire
to
invest
in
land
should
come
to
mexico
there
is
surely
no
other
place
in
the
world
where
one
could
get
so
much
out
of
a
piece
of
property
one
end
of
a
field
can
be
tilled
while
the
other
is
being
harvested
and
one
can
have
as
many
crops
a
year
as
he
has
energy
and
time
to
plant
there
is
no
doubt
that
anything
can
be
cultivated
here
of
course
peaches
and
apples
are
not
plenty
because
they
only
grow
wild
why
even
a
nurseryman
would
fail
to
recognize
them
in
the
small
scraggy
untrimmed
bushes
the
native
fruits
are
fine
from
the
reason
that
they
need
no
cultivating
or
trimming
if
they
did
mexico
would
have
a
famine
in
the
fruit
line
land
in
mexico
is
very
cheap
and
the
government
collects
a
tax
only
on
what
is
cultivated
one
sensible
man
by
the
name
of
hale
came
here
from
san
francisco
a
few
weeks
ago
to
buy
property
a
minister
of
the
gospel
a
particular
friend
of
hale
is
authority
for
it
that
senor
hale
bought
from
the
government
thousand
square
miles
larger
than
the
whole
of
england
i
believe
for
i
do
think
one
would
ever
tire
of
the
pictures
mexico
is
ever
presenting
though
in
mexico
two
months
i
can
find
something
new
every
time
i
glance
at
the
queer
people
this
little
basket
vender
is
but
one
of
thousands
but
we
find
he
is
the
first
one
to
wear
his
white
shirt
without
tying
the
two
sides
together
in
a
knot
in
front
he
must
surely
have
forgotten
that
part
of
his
toilet
as
it
is
the
universal
style
and
custom
among
them
all
very
few
mexicans
even
among
the
better
class
wear
suspenders
they
wrap
themselves
about
the
waist
with
a
scarf
with
fringed
ends
and
this
constitutes
suspenders
many
of
the
better
class
wear
embroidered
and
ruffled
shirt
fronts
the
fruit
venders
have
beautiful
voices
and
sing
out
their
wares
in
such
a
charming
manner
that
one
is
sorry
when
they
disappear
around
the
corner
they
are
sometimes
quite
picturesque
with
the
fruit
and
vegetables
tied
up
in
their
rebozo
and
baskets
in
their
hands
why
the
women
have
all
their
skirts
plain
behind
and
pleated
in
front
i
can
not
say
but
such
is
invariably
the
case
the
men
have
horrible
voices
when
they
are
out
selling
there
never
was
anything
to
equal
them
i
wonder
if
our
florists
would
not
like
to
buy
orchids
from
the
man
who
passes
our
door
every
morning
with
about
a
hundred
of
them
strung
to
a
pole
which
is
suspended
from
his
shoulder
only
two
reals
cents
for
exquisite
plants
with
the
rare
ones
but
little
higher
sborigi
a
pittsburger
was
in
mexico
on
a
visit
when
he
landed
in
vera
cruz
he
went
into
the
country
to
see
the
place
hearing
music
in
a
small
cabin
he
drew
nearer
and
recognized
familiar
tunes
wait
till
the
clouds
roll
by
and
fritz
lullaby
a
man
came
out
and
invited
him
in
and
after
a
short
time
he
said
he
was
a
colored
man
that
his
name
was
jones
and
he
came
from
pittsburg
pa
he
is
married
to
an
indian
woman
and
has
about
twenty
children
ranging
all
sizes
jones
is
king
of
the
villa
in
one
room
he
has
a
floor
a
thing
not
possessed
by
any
other
inhabitant
there
and
his
cabin
is
superior
to
all
others
he
is
very
proud
of
his
wife
and
children
and
has
not
the
least
desire
to
return
to
the
smoky
city
he
speaks
spanish
french
and
english
fluently
when
sborigi
was
asked
for
his
ticket
on
the
vera
cruz
line
he
jokingly
handed
the
conductor
an
envelope
that
he
had
put
in
his
pocket
at
new
orleans
on
it
was
printed
in
english
tickets
to
all
points
of
the
world
the
conductor
took
the
envelope
looked
at
it
punched
it
and
returned
it
to
the
donor
quite
amused
sborigi
tried
it
on
others
and
he
not
only
traveled
the
entire
distance
to
mexico
but
traveled
on
at
least
half
a
dozen
branch
roads
leading
from
the
vera
cruz
line
to
beautiful
towns
in
the
country
he
took
the
punched
envelope
back
to
pittsburg
as
a
memento
of
the
cheapest
journey
he
ever
took
chapter
xiii
in
mexican
theaters
mexico
does
not
know
how
a
nation
mourned
for
one
virginius
like
mccullough
has
never
witnessed
barrett
cassius
and
david
garrick
or
been
thrilled
with
monte

has
never
looked
on

exquisite

unconscious
of

has
never

in
spite
of
all
and
a

successfully
transformed
into
a
child
of
nine
fanchon
is
in
blissful
ignorance
of
pinafore
and
mikado
and
yet
she
lives
and
has
theaters
the
most
fashionable
theater
in
mexico
is
the
national
president
diaz
always
attends
and
of
course
the
elite
follow
suit
it
is
well
to
say
the
president
always
attends
for
there
is
little
else
to
go
to
theaters
and
driving
are
all
the
pleasures
of
mexican
life
the
president
gives
no
receptions
or
dinners
and
entertains
no
thursday
or
saturday
afternoon
callers
so
before
death
entered
his
family
circle
he
was
at
the
theater
almost
every
night
no
paid
advertising
is
done
by
theaters
in
the
papers
once
in
a
while
they
with
the
exception
of
the
national
send
around
bills
of
their
coming
plays
accompanied
by
two
tickets
for
this
they
get
a
advertising
cheap
rates
eh
besides
this
they
have
native
artists
who
select
the
most
horrible
scene
to
depict
in
water
colors
on
cloth
and
hang
at
the
entrance
these
cartels
changed
necessarily
with
every
play
as
billboards
are
in
the
states
and
some
of
them
are
most
ludicrous
and
horrible
in
the
extreme
the
saturday
i
reached
mexico
one
of
the
theaters
had
on
its
boards
a
play
the
cartel
of
which
represented
the
crucifixion
what
the
play
was
could
not
be
ascertained
sunday
is
the
most
fashionable
theater
day
every
person
who
can
possibly
collect
together
enough
money
goes
from
the
poor
naked
peon
to
the
spanish
millionaire
on
monday
all
amusement
houses
are
closed
and
many
are
only
open
every
other
day
throughout
the
entire
week
they
are
not
at
all
particular
about
fulfilling
engagements
a
play
may
be
billed
for
a
certain
night
and
on
arrival
there
the
servant
will
politely
inform
you
it
is
postponed
until
mauana
and
all
you
can
do
is
to
go
back
home
and
await
their
pleasure
the
national
theater
is
a
fine
building
with
accommodations
for
persons
the
first
entrance
is
a
wide
open
space
faced
with
mammoth
pillars
going
up
the
steps
you
enter
through
a
heavily
draped
doorway
the
vestibule
or
hall
along
the
sides
are
racks
where
gentlemen
and
ladies
deposit
their
wraps
the
orchestra
or
pit
the
fashionable
quarter
in
american
theaters
is
known
as
the
lunetas
the
seats
are
chairs
of
ancient
shape
and
most
uncomfortable
style
they
were
evidently
fashioned
more
for
durability
than
beauty
being
made
of
very
heavy
unpainted
wood
narrow
passageways
intersect
each
other
and
wooden
benches
are
placed
along
the
seats
to
serve
as
down
in
front
of
the
stage
is
the
orchestra
flanked
at
either
end
by
long
benches
running
lengthwise
of
the
stage
boxes
six
stories
in
height
look
out
upon
the
stage
and
balconies
circle
the
room
the
balconies
are
divided
into
compartments
holding
eight
persons
common
straight
chairs
with
large
mirrors
on
the
door
and
walls
are
the
only
furnishment
the
lunetas
command
cents
to
palcos
boxes
a
chair
and
the
galeria
the
sixth
row
of
balconies
cents
at
the
orchestra
strikes
up
people
come
in
and
find
their
places
and
about
the
curtain
goes
up
and
silence
reigns
the
enthusiasm
which
is
manifested
at
is
absent
here
everything
is
accepted
and
witnessed
with
an
air
of
boredom
and
martyrdom
that
is
quite
pathetic
more
time
is
spent
gazing
around
at
the
audience
than
at
the
players
everybody
carries
and
makes
good
use
of
them
without
doubt
you
would
like
to
know
how
they
dress
the
men
who
always
come
first
you
know
wear
handsome
suits
displaying
immaculate
and
collar
that
would
make
eastern
dudes
turn
green
with
envy
generally
the
suit
is
entirely
black
yet
some
wear
light
pantaloons
high
silk
and
a
large
display
of
jewelry
finish
the
handsome
spanish
man
the
ladies
wear
full
dress
always
light
in
color
pink
blue
pea
green
white
trimmed
with
flowers
ribbons
or
handsome
laces
the
hair
is
arranged
artistically
and
the
dresses
are
always
cut
very
low
displaying
neck
and
arms
such
as
only
mexican
women
possess
very
handsome
combs
and
pins
generally
grace
the
hair
young
girls
sometimes
wear
flowers
but
it
is
considered
better
taste
to
wear
the
artificial
article
because
the
real
are
so
cheap
and
the
former
unsurpassed
by
nature
command
very
high
prices
a
mexican
woman
would
not
be
dressed
without
the
expensive
fan
which
she
flits
before
her
face
with
exquisite
grace
the
prevailing
style
is
a
point
lace
fan
which
adds
beauty
to
the
face
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
hide
it
from
beholders
for
let
it
be
whispered
mexican
girls
are
fond
of
being
looked
at
a
lady
considers
it
the
highest
compliment
she
can
receive
for
a
man
to
stare
at
her
for
a
long
time
and
the
men
come
quite
up
to
the
point
of
being
extremely
complimentary
the
prompter
box
is
fixed
in
front
of
the
stage
and
his
voice
is
not
only
heard
continually
above
that
of
the
actors
but
his
candle
and
hands
are
always
visible
and
he
often
takes
time
to
peep
out
and
take
a
survey
of
the
audience
but
the
mexicans
do
not
notice
him
any
more
than
the
footlights
a
bell
which
sounds
as
heavy
as
a
church
bell
rings
and
the
curtain
falls
well
it
is
a
sight
the
managers
farm
out
the
to
business
men
by
the
square
the
enterprising
advertiser
has
painted
on
a
piece
of
cloth
his
place
of
business
and
curious
signs
one
shows
a
man
riding
a
fat
pig
and
from
out
the
mouth
comes
the
word
carne
beef
how
they
make
beef
out
of
pork
is
unknown
saloons
take
up
the
most
prominent
place
a
house
bearing
the
sign
pulque
had
the
side
knocked
out
displaying
a
barrel
which
filled
the
building
from
floor
to
roof
cupid
was
astride
a
barrel
sipping
pulque
from
an
immense
schooner
forgetting
in
his
enjoyment
his
usual
occupation
of
softening
other
people
brains
with
wine
one
fat
old
fellow
had
gone
to
sleep
with
a
generous
smile
on
his
open
countenance
while
from
a
large
glass
which
he
held
in
his
hand
the
drink
was
running
down
his
coat
sleeve
another
fellow
equally
fat
and
equally
bald
was
gazing
at
a
full
champagne
glass
in
drunken
adoration
these
are
a
few
of
the
curious
inducements
for
people
to
patronize
certain
stores
the
signs
are
only
pinned
on
and
as
the
curtain
comes
tumbling
down
they
fly
work
and
twist
in
the
most
comical
style
naturally
the
spectators
would
grow
tired
gazing
at
such
a
thing
so
between
acts
the
ladies
visit
one
another
and
the
men
rise
in
their
seats
put
on
their
hats
turn
their
backs
toward
the
stage
and
survey
the
people
english
fashion
they
smoke
their
cigarettes
chat
to
one
another
and
discuss
the
women
the
rings
again
people
commence
to
embrace
and
kiss
and
when
the
third
bell
rings
hats
are
off
cigarettes
extinguished
and
every
one
in
place
in
time
to
see
the
curtain
after
being
down
for
thirty
minutes
rise
theaters
close
anywhere
between
and
three
the
audience
applaud
very
little
unless
some
one
is
murdered
artistically
if
a
few
feel
like
applauding
other
fine
points
they
are
quickly
silenced
by
the
thousands
of
hisses
which
issue
from
all
quarters
of
the
house
and
a
mexican
hiss
has
no
equal
in
the
world
ladies
do
not
applaud
never
look
pleased
or
interested
but
sit
like
so
many
statues
calmly
and
stupidly
indifferent
after
the
play
every
one
who
can
afford
it
goes
to
some
restaurant
for
refreshments
mexicans
are
not
easily
pleased
with
plays
and
the
only
time
they
enjoy
themselves
is
when
they
have
a
zarzuela
a
cross
between
a
comic
opera
and
a
drama
then
they
forget
to
hiss
and
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
play
with
as
much
vim
as
an
american
some
mexicans
are
quite
famous
as
when
a
new
piece
is
ready
for
the
boards
a
house
is
rented
and
it
is
presented
in
fine
style
the
occasion
being
a
sort
of
social
gathering
being
invited
the
other
night
to
attend
one
i
concluded
to
see
what
it
was
like
the
author
had
one
of
his
plays
translated
into
english
the
name
now
forgotten
which
has
met
with
great
success
in
the
states
i
thought
this
would
be
endurable
as
i
entered
with
some
ladies
an
usher
in
full
dress
and
white
kid
gloves
presented
each
of
us
with
beautiful
bouquets
and
offering
his
arm
to
the
ladies
escorted
the
party
to
the
box
with
the
air
and
manner
of
a
prince
once
in
the
box
he
gave
us
little
programmes
went
out
and
locked
the
door
interested
i
watched
the
people
as
they
came
in
and
arranged
themselves
comfortably
much
amused
and
even
disconcerted
we
were
when
we
found
hundreds
of
glasses
turned
our
way
and
held
there
long
and
steadily
as
they
saw
we
were
greengoes
or
foreigners
and
with
feminine
timidity
we
thanked
our
lucky
stars
we
had
ventured
forth
without
a
bonnet
as
no
woman
ever
wears
a
hat
to
the
theater
here
so
that
the
difference
would
not
have
been
more
pronounced
at
last
the
curtain
went
up
and
before
the
actress
who
was
sitting
on
a
chair
crying
could
issue
one
blubber
dozens
of
bouquets
were
flung
at
her
feet
not
understanding
the
words
the
play
seemed
most
absurd
apparently
the
girl
could
not
marry
her
lover
because
her
mother
had
forbidden
it
as
another
sister
loved
the
same
man
and
as
he
did
not
reciprocate
she
was
dying
the
dying
sister
appeared
but
once
then
in
a
nightdress
and
soon
afterward
screamed
heartily
behind
the
scenes
and
was
pronounced
dead
by
the
actors
the
men
and
women
cried
continuously
all
the
evening
and
americans
dubbed
the
play
the
once
when
the
lover
told
his
sweetheart
he
was
going
out
to
fight
a
duel
with
a
dude
with
a
big
who
had
loved
the
dead
girl
she
fainted
on
his
breast
and
he
held
her
there
staggering
beneath
her
weight
while
he
delivered
a
eulogy
as
she
was
about
two
feet
taller
and
twice
as
heavy
as
he
the
scene
was
most
comical
particularly
when
she
tried
to
double
up
to
reach
his
shoulder
and
forgot
she
had
fainted
and
moved
her
hands
repeatedly
but
smothering
our
american
mirth
we
looked
on
in
sympathy
how
it
ended
i
can
not
tell
for
at
i
started
for
home
and
the
players
were
then
weeping
with
as
much
vigor
as
when
the
curtain
first
rose
the
carvings
and
finishing
of
the
national
theater
are
superb
it
is
surpassed
by
few
in
the
states
but
the
walls
are
smeared
and
dirty
no
curtains
deck
the
boxes
uncomfortable
chairs
are
alone
procurable
and
all
in
all
the
house
is
about
as
filthy
as
one
can
find
in
mexico
it
is
rumored
that
sarah
bernhardt
is
to
come
to
mexico
next
december
with
a
french
troupe
and
as
french
is
as
common
as
spanish
here
she
will
doubtless
have
large
houses
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
managers
will
awaken
to
the
fact
that
the
house
needs
a
scrubbing
down
and
fumigating
before
that
time
as
stated
before
young
men
do
not
need
to
keep
back
their
washerwoman
money
to
be
able
to
take
their
best
girl
to
the
theater
a
gentlemen
and
lady
are
never
seen
alone
even
husband
and
wife
if
they
have
no
friends
take
a
servant
along
mexico
supports
a
circus
all
winter
they
have
an
amphitheater
built
for
the
purpose
and
it
is
the
best
lighted
and
cleanest
spot
in
the
city
it
is
open
afternoons
and
evenings
except
monday
the
seats
are
arranged
pit
boxes
and
balconies
some
very
good
performing
is
done
but
spanish
jokes
by
the
clowns
and
very
daring
feats
on
horseback
are
the
only
acts
which
gain
applause
from
the
mexicans
the
menagerie
for
which
they
charge
cents
extra
is
not
well
attended
as
the
people
can
see
more
in
the
museum
for
nothing
and
they
prefer
the
beasts
stuffed
to
being
stuffed
themselves
or
stuffing
another
man
purse
for
the
sight
of
a
lion
monkey
and
striped
donkey
chapter
xiv
the
floating
gardens
of
course
everybody
has
heard
of
the
famous
floating
gardens
of
mexico
and
naturally
when
one
reaches
this
lovely
clime
their
first
desire
is
to
go
up
to
la
viga
i
wanted
to
visit
the
gardens
and
with
a
friend
who
put
up
a
nice
lunch
started
out
to
spend
the
day
on
the
water
the
sun
was
just
peeping
over
the
hilltops
when
we
took
a
car
marked
la
viga
and
off
we
went
we
spent
the
time
translating
signs
and
looking
at
the
queer
things
to
be
seen
the
oddest
sight
was
the
slaughter
shop
the
stone
building
looked
like
a
fortress
around
the
entrance
were
hundreds
of
mules
and
horses
on
which
men
were
hanging
meat
they
had
one
wagon
but
the
meat
after
rubbing
the
bony
sides
of
the
beasts
was
just
as
palatable
as
when
hauled
in
it
it
was
built
like
a
chicken
coop
and
elevated
on
two
large
wheels
on
each
side
of
the
coop
and
lying
in
a
large
heap
on
the
bottom
was
the
meat
astride
the
pile
sat
a
fellow
and
in
front
on
the
outside
sat
the
bloody
driver
trudging
along
in
a
string
of
about
forty
were
men
with
baskets
filled
with
the
refuse
from
which
the
blood
ran
in
little
rivers
until
they
looked
as
if
they
had
actually
bathed
in
gore
we
were
glad
when
our
car
passed
and
had
no
appetite
for
the
lunch
in
our
basket
when
the
car
reached
its
destination
we
alighted
and
were
instantly
surrounded
with
boatman
neatly
clad
in
suits
consisting
of
white
linen
blouse
and
pants
everyone
clamored
for
us
to
try
his
boat
and
the
crowd
was
so
dense
that
it
was
impossible
to
move
as
there
is
no
regular
price
we
had
to
make
a
bargain
so
we
selected
a
strong
brown
fellow
who
although
he
pressed
close
up
to
us
had
not
uttered
a
word
while
the
rest
had
been
dwelling
on
the
merits
of
their
boats
we
went
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
canal
and
looked
at
his
little
flat
covered
with
a
tin
roof
white
linen
kept
out
the
sun
at
the
sides
and
pink
calico
edged
with
red
and
green
fringe
covered
the
seats
the
bottom
was
scrubbed
very
white
and
the
mexican
colors
floated
from
the
pole
at
the
end
we
asked
his
price
six
dollars
he
answered
no
we
said
it
too
much
after
more
debating
and
deliberating
he
set
his
price
at
one
dollar
which
we
accepted
sunday
is
market
day
and
la
viga
was
consequently
the
prettiest
sight
we
had
yet
seen
in
mexico
it
was
completely
filled
with
boats
containing
produce
some
were
packed
full
of
fresh
vegetables
some
contained
gay
colored
birds
which
the
indians
trap
in
the
mountains
and
bring
to
market
here
and
others
were
a
mass
of
exquisite
flowers
while
the
man
piloted
his
boat
over
the
glassy
waters
the
ever
busy
woman
wove
wreaths
and
made
bouquets
from
the
stock
before
her
such
roses
i
can
yet
inhale
their
perfume
and
how
they
recalled
kind
friends
at
home
daisies
honeysuckles
bachelor
buttons
in
variety
unknown
in
the
states
and
the
poppies
surely
no
other
spot
on
earth
brings
forth
such
a
variety
of
shade
color
and
size
they
are
even
finer
than
the
peonies
of
the
states
but
this
boatful
has
passed
only
to
bring
others
ever
the
same
yet
always
new
they
look
at
us
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
we
answer
their
cheerful
salutes
with
a
happy
feeling
along
the
banks
we
see
people
decorating
their
straw
huts
with
a
long
plant
which
contains
yellow
and
red
flowers
they
plait
it
at
the
top
in
diamond
shape
and
not
only
put
it
on
their
homes
but
use
it
to
decorate
the
pulque
shops
and
stretch
across
streets
the
most
disagreeable
sight
was
the
butcher
at
work
every
here
and
there
along
the
shore
are
large
copper
kettles
filled
with
boiling
water
one
man
held
a
little
brown
pig
down
with
his
knee
and
cut
its
throat
while
another
held
a
small
bowl
in
which
he
caught
the
blood
still
further
up
we
saw
the
first
work
completed
and
on
sticks
put
in
the
ground
around
a
large
charcoal
fire
were
the
different
pieces
roasting
the
flies
were
as
thick
as
bumblebees
in
a
field
of
clover
and
we
realized
for
the
first
time
that
summer
with
all
its
pests
as
well
as
its
glories
was
on
our
heels
wash
day
like
everything
else
in
the
labor
line
here
comes
on
sunday
under
the
drooping
willows
were
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
the
men
were
nursing
the
babies
and
smoking
the
pipe
of
peace
while
the
women
were
washing
their
clothes
they
were
not
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
they
were
in
extreme
full
dress
a
little
more
so
than
that
of
the
fashionable
lady
of
the
period
for
none
of
them
possess
more
than
one
shirt
and
they
have
no
bed
to
go
to
while
that
is
being
washed
so
they
bask
in
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
the
nude
children
play
in
the
dark
waters
of
la
viga
like
so
many
sportive
lambs
on
a
green
lawn
while
the
industrious
wife
and
mother
washes
the
clothes
on
a
porous
stone
and
dries
them
on
the
banks
happy
cheerful
and
as
contented
as
though
she
were
a
queen
i
think
i
have
stated
before
that
mexico
can
not
be
entered
except
through
its
city
gates
which
are
not
only
guarded
by
soldiers
but
also
a
customs
officer
who
inspects
all
the
things
brought
in
by
the
poor
peons
and
puts
a
high
duty
on
them
a
poor
man
and
woman
may
travel
for
days
with
their
coops
filled
with
chickens
pay
duty
on
them
and
have
but
a
few
cents
extra
for
all
that
labor
and
travel
could
one
blame
them
then
if
they
were
lazy
and
live
on
what
nature
grows
for
them
without
cultivation
they
are
not
lazy
but
their
burden
will
not
be
lightened
until
this
outrageous
taxation
which
goes
to
line
the
pockets
of
some
individual
is
removed
even
on
la
viga
they
have
the
customs
gate
to
pass
the
officer
examines
everything
and
not
only
charges
the
price
but
always
takes
from
the
load
whatever
he
wishes
gratis
in
one
day
collection
he
not
only
has
enough
to
run
a
hotel
but
has
plenty
left
to
sell
when
a
boat
is
packed
with
vegetables
a
long
steel
prong
is
run
through
them
to
make
sure
there
is
nothing
beneath
la
viga
is
from
six
to
twelve
feet
deep
and
about
thirty
feet
wide
on
either
side
it
is
lined
with
willow
and
silver
maple
trees
it
starts
from
lake
tezcuco
about
eight
miles
from
the
city
forms
a
ring
and
goes
back
to
the
same
source
the
floating
gardens
so
called
are
found
just
above
the
custom
house
from
the
name
we
naturally
expected
to
see
some
kind
of
a
garden
floating
on
the
water
but
we
did
not
boatman
where
are
the
floating
gardens
there
senorita
he
answered
what
that
solid
dry
land
no
senorita
with
your
permission
we
will
take
a
canoe
and
go
in
among
them
con
mucho
gusto
we
replied
with
harry
greaser
talk
and
getting
into
a
little
dugout
we
were
pushed
at
the
risk
of
being
beheaded
under
a
low
stone
bridge
by
our
boatman
who
waded
in
the
water
we
saluted
the
owners
of
a
little
castle
built
of
cane
and
roofed
with
straw
and
went
on
impatient
to
see
the
gardens
in
blocks
of
fifteen
by
thirty
feet
nestle
the
gardens
surrounded
by
water
and
rising
two
feet
above
its
surface
the
ground
is
fertile
and
rich
and
will
grow
anything
some
have
fruit
trees
others
vegetables
and
some
look
like
one
bed
of
flowers
suspended
in
the
water
around
in
the
little
canals
through
which
we
drifted
were
hundreds
of
elegant
eagerly
we
gathered
them
with
a
desire
which
seemed
never
to
be
satisfied
and
even
when
our
boat
was
full
we
still
clutched
ones
which
were
the
prettiest
yet
on
some
gardens
were
cattle
and
horses
sheep
and
pigs
all
of
them
tied
to
trees
to
save
them
from
falling
into
the
water
the
quaint
little
homes
were
some
of
the
prettiest
features
they
were
surrounded
by
trees
and
flowers
and
many
of
them
had
exquisite
little
summer
houses
built
also
of
cane
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
gardens
the
hedges
or
walls
were
made
of
roses
which
were
all
in
bloom
sending
forth
a
perfume
that
was
entrancing
the
gardeners
water
their
plots
every
day
on
the
end
of
a
long
pole
they
fasten
a
dipper
and
with
it
they
dip
up
water
and
fling
it
over
their
vegetables
in
quite
a
deft
and
speedy
manner
no
the
gardens
do
not
float
but
a
visit
to
them
fully
repays
one
for
their
disappointment
in
finding
that
they
are
stationary
undoubtedly
many
years
ago
these
same
gardens
did
really
float
history
says
they
were
built
of
weeds
cane
and
roots
and
banked
up
with
earth
the
aztecs
had
not
only
their
gardens
on
them
but
their
little
homes
and
they
poled
them
around
whenever
they
wished
old
age
and
perhaps
rheumatism
has
stiffened
their
joints
and
they
are
now
and
forever
more
stationary
joaquin
miller
said
now
nellie
the
gardens
do
not
float
but
please
do
not
spoil
the
pretty
belief
by
telling
the
truth
about
them
but
either
our
respect
for
the
truth
or
a
desire
to
do
just
the
opposite
to
what
others
wish
has
made
us
tell
just
what
the
floating
gardens
really
are
at
the
very
least
they
repay
trouble
for
the
journey
as
it
was
about
the
hour
for
breakfast
we
opened
our
basket
and
found
one
dozen
eggs
two
loaves
of
bread
plenty
of
cold
chicken
and
meat
fruit
and
many
other
things
equally
good
and
bad
for
the
inner
tyrant
and
last
but
not
least
a
dozen
bottles
of
beer
that
is
not
horrible
because
no
one
drinks
water
here
as
it
is
very
impure
and
two
or
three
glasses
have
often
produced
fever
of
course
i
could
have
delicately
avoided
the
beer
bottles
in
my
articles
i
mean
but
i
could
not
resist
relating
the
funny
incident
connected
with
them
for
the
benefit
of
others
one
of
the
party
was
a
strict
temperance
advocate
and
when
the
bottles
were
opened
the
beer
was
found
to
be
sour
as
it
is
a
most
difficult
place
to
try
to
preserve
bottled
goods
we
immediately
refused
to
drink
it
but
the
said
he
would
test
it
so
we
gave
him
a
glass
which
he
drained
we
were
amused
but
courteously
restrained
our
smiles
but
as
bottle
after
bottle
was
opened
and
the
insisted
on
testing
each
one
our
mirth
got
the
best
of
us
and
i
burst
out
laughing
joined
heartily
by
the
rest
we
fed
our
boatman
and
i
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
his
hearty
thanks
his
good
appetite
his
humble
thankful
words
between
mouthfuls
did
me
a
world
of
good
the
sour
beer
which
was
left
by
the
we
gave
him
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
best
of
drinks
never
tasted
as
good
as
that
to
our
poor
boatman
on
the
gardens
they
have
put
up
wooden
crosses
and
tied
a
cotton
cloth
to
them
they
are
believed
to
be
a
preventive
of
storms
visiting
the
land
as
the
wind
after
playing
with
the
cotton
cloth
is
afterward
unable
to
blow
strong
enough
to
destroy
anything
when
we
anchored
at
one
of
the
villages
some
men
came
down
and
asked
us
to
come
to
their
houses
to
eat
each
told
of
the
good
things
his
wife
had
prepared
and
one
as
an
inducement
said
i
have
a
table
in
my
house
that
of
course
is
a
big
thing
here
as
not
one
indian
in
one
hundred
owns
a
table
or
chair
pulque
is
sold
very
cheap
at
these
villages
and
many
of
the
mexicans
come
up
in
boats
or
on
horseback
to
treat
themselves
along
each
side
of
la
viga
ore
beautiful
paseos
bordered
by
large
shade
trees
they
form
some
of
the
many
and
most
beautiful
drives
in
mexico
and
on
sunday
the
paseos
are
filled
with
crowds
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
horseback
it
is
also
one
of
the
favorite
places
for
racing
and
any
one
who
is
fond
of
fine
riding
will
have
a
chance
to
see
it
here
two
young
fellows
took
from
off
the
horses
the
saddles
and
bridles
then
removing
their
coats
and
hats
they
rode
a
mile
race
on
the
bare
horses
large
bets
were
made
on
it
and
every
one
enjoyed
the
exhibition
in
the
afternoon
we
turned
our
boat
toward
the
city
followed
by
a
boat
containing
a
family
the
father
and
largest
son
were
doing
the
poling
and
the
mother
was
bathing
her
babes
she
rubbed
them
with
soap
and
then
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
doused
them
up
and
down
in
the
water
after
she
had
finished
and
dressed
them
in
the
clothes
which
had
in
the
meanwhile
been
drying
in
the
boat
she
washed
her
face
and
hair
combed
it
with
a
and
let
it
hang
loose
over
her
back
to
dry
on
the
way
to
town
when
we
repassed
the
encountered
going
up
we
were
surprised
to
see
it
nearly
deserted
and
the
few
remaining
ones
donning
their
clean
linen
getting
into
their
canoes
and
paddling
around
the
canal
when
we
reached
santa
anita
a
village
of
straw
mansions
we
found
they
were
celebrating
an
annual
and
that
the
town
was
not
only
crowded
with
guests
but
la
viga
was
almost
impassable
for
boats
on
this
special
day
it
is
the
custom
for
everybody
to
wear
wreaths
of
poppies
the
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
street
were
selling
them
as
fast
as
they
could
hand
them
out
from
a
stand
a
brass
band
was
sending
forth
its
lovely
strains
and
beneath
were
the
people
dancing
they
have
no
square
dances
or
waltzes
but
the
dance
is
similar
to
an
irish
reel
without
touching
one
another
and
merely
balancing
back
forth
and
sideways
pulque
was
flowing
as
freely
as
niagara
falls
and
for
the
first
time
we
realized
what
dead
drunk
meant
one
woman
was
overcome
and
had
been
drawn
out
of
la
viga
into
which
she
had
fallen
she
lay
on
the
bank
wet
muddy
covered
with
flies
face
down
on
the
earth
with
no
more
life
than
a
corpse
she
was
really
paralyzed
after
we
tired
of
watching
them
we
continued
our
journey
our
boatman
wending
his
way
deftly
between
the
crowds
of
others
who
were
making
their
way
to
the
feast
they
all
greeted
us
and
said
many
pretty
things
because
i
had
put
on
a
wreath
they
considered
i
had
honored
them
nearly
every
boat
had
one
or
more
guitars
and
the
singing
and
music
added
a
finishing
touch
to
the
already
beautiful
and
interesting
scene
about
mounted
and
unmounted
soldiers
had
gone
out
to
keep
the
peace
but
they
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
as
much
as
the
others
and
doubtless
would
consume
just
as
much
pulque
before
midnight
hailing
a
passing
carriage
as
we
landed
we
drove
to
our
house
jotting
down
the
day
spent
on
la
viga
as
one
of
the
most
pleasant
of
our
delightful
sojourn
in
this
heavenly
land
chapter
xv
the
castle
of
chapultepec
when
maximilian
first
established
his
royal
presence
in
mexico
he
began
to
do
what
he
could
toward
beautifying
this
picturesque
valley
the
city
had
been
rebuilt
on
the
old
aztec
site
the
lowest
and
worst
spot
in
the
land
maximilian
concluded
to
draw
the
city
toward
a
better
locality
in
order
to
do
this
he
selected
chapultepec
as
the
place
for
his
castle
and
built
lovely
drives
running
from
all
directions
to
the
site
of
his
residence
the
drives
are
wide
bordered
with
tall
trees
and
form
one
of
the
prettiest
features
in
mexico
the
most
direct
drive
from
the
city
is
the
paseo
spoken
of
in
a
former
letter
as
the
drive
for
the
fashionable
maximilian
intended
his
home
should
be
the
center
of
the
new
mexico
and
the
paseo
boulevard
of
the
emperor
was
to
lead
to
the
gate
of
his
park
from
the
alameda
to
chapultepec
the
distance
is
yards
with
a
width
of
feet
the
paseo
contains
six
circular
plots
which
maximilian
intended
should
contain
statues
strange
to
say
this
plan
is
partly
being
executed
some
already
contain
an
equestrian
statue
of
charles
claimed
to
be
second
only
to
one
other
in
the
world
a
magnificent
bronze
statue
of
columbus
and
they
are
erecting
one
to
guatemoc
and
one
to
cortes
on
either
aide
of
the
paseo
are
grand
old
aqueducts
leaky
and
the
one
ending
at
the
castle
the
other
going
further
up
into
the
mountains
one
is
said
to
be
nine
miles
in
length
these
aqueducts
hold
very
beautiful
carved
pieces
and
niches
every
here
and
there
in
which
are
placed
images
of
the
virgin
terminating
the
avenue
rises
the
castle
on
a
rocky
hill
some
hundred
feet
high
the
castle
covers
the
entire
top
and
stands
like
a
guard
to
the
entire
valley
many
hundred
years
ago
the
king
of
the
aztec
indians
had
this
for
his
favorite
palace
here
he
ruled
beloved
by
all
until
the
stranger
invaded
his
land
outraged
his
hospitality
and
trust
stole
his
gold
and
jewels
and
replaced
them
with
glass
beads
tore
down
his
gods
and
replaced
them
with
a
new
butchered
his
people
and
not
only
made
him
an
imbecile
but
caused
him
to
die
at
the
hands
of
his
once
loving
subjects
the
despised
of
all
the
people
poor
montezuma
the
wisest
best
and
most
honorable
king
of
his
time
after
all
his
goodness
his
striving
for
the
light
of
learning
to
die
such
a
death
since
montezuma
wandered
beneath
the
shades
of
chapultepec
hill
of
the
grasshopper
it
has
been
the
chosen
resort
of
the
successive
rulers
of
mexico
the
theme
of
poets
the
dream
of
artists
and
the
admiration
of
all
beholders
a
massive
iron
gate
guarded
over
by
dozens
of
sentinels
admits
you
to
a
forest
of
cypress
which
excels
anything
on
this
continent
the
grand
old
trees
many
centuries
old
are
made
the
more
beautiful
by
the
heavy
dress
of
gray
moss
which
drapes
the
limbs
the
broad
carriage
road
to
which
the
sun
never
penetrates
and
where
the
beautiful
shadowy
twilight
ever
rests
winds
around
and
around
until
it
gains
the
summit
the
old
bath
of
montezuma
stands
a
lovely
ruin
in
this
lovely
grove
above
it
is
built
an
engine
house
for
the
waterworks
which
are
to
supply
the
city
instead
of
the
aqueduct
with
regret
we
gazed
on
it
the
only
blot
on
the
otherwise
perfect
paradise
and
wished
that
some
one
with
the
taste
of
maximilian
had
interfered
before
this
mark
of
progress
had
been
decided
upon
the
silvery
lake
alive
with
geese
and
ducks
and
bordered
with
lilies
of
the
nile
and
other
beautiful
flowers
nestles
like
a
birdling
in
the
heart
of
the
greensward
the
fountains
play
and
sing
their
everlasting
song
while
birds
of
exquisite
colors
mingle
their
sweet
melodies
with
the
tinkle
of
the
falling
waters
plots
of
flowers
vie
with
each
other
to
put
forth
the
most
beautiful
colors
all
nature
seems
to
be
doing
its
utmost
to
show
its
gratitude
for
being
assigned
to
this
beautiful
spot
far
back
in
the
forest
is
a
smooth
level
place
where
moonlight
picnics
are
often
held
the
soft
drapery
of
spanish
moss
hangs
low
yet
high
enough
not
to
interfere
with
the
headgear
beneath
its
shadows
one
would
fain
forget
the
world
we
no
longer
wonder
at
the
mauana
of
the
natives
and
can
clearly
see
why
they
wish
to
live
as
slow
and
as
long
as
possible
when
montezuma
reigned
supreme
he
was
accustomed
to
gather
together
his
wise
men
and
while
sitting
beneath
the
shade
of
a
monstrous
cypress
they
would
discuss
the
topics
of
the
day
for
this
reason
the
tree
is
named
the
tree
of
montezuma
it
is
said
to
be
two
hundred
feet
high
and
sixty
feet
in
circumference
it
is
heavily
draped
with
moss
and
is
the
most
magnificent
monument
any
king
could
have
half
way
up
the
hill
is
an
entrance
almost
hidden
by
moss
and
other
creeping
foliage
which
leads
into
a
cave
the
first
chamber
is
a
very
large
room
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
at
the
opposite
side
is
an
iron
door
barring
the
way
to
the
cave
proper
many
different
stories
are
told
of
it
one
is
that
the
cave
was
here
before
the
time
of
montezuma
and
that
untold
wealth
has
been
hidden
in
its
unexplored
recesses
when
different
tribes
went
to
war
another
says
that
when
cortes
was
forced
to
leave
he
buried
his
wealth
in
its
darkened
depths
the
less
romantic
story
is
that
the
subterranean
which
leads
down
from
the
garden
on
the
roof
of
the
castle
opens
into
the
cave
they
once
tried
to
explore
it
and
found
within
a
mammoth
hole
a
rock
thrown
in
was
not
heard
to
strike
the
bottom
and
even
the
bravest
feared
to
go
further
the
rocks
on
the
hill
are
covered
with
hieroglyphics
which
archaeologists
have
not
succeeded
in
translating
the
brick
fence
around
the
winding
drive
has
passed
its
day
of
beauty
and
the
posts
alone
remain
of
the
lamps
which
once
lighted
pathway
having
obtained
a
ticket
of
admission
to
the
castle
from
the
governor
of
the
national
palace
we
took
a
party
of
tourists
with
us
and
proceeded
to
investigate
when
we
had
mounted
the
hill
and
walked
through
the
iron
gate
into
the
yard
the
uniformed
sentinel
called
out
something
in
spanish
loud
and
long
and
a
drummer
boy
quite
near
beat
a
hasty
roll
they
must
think
we
intend
to
storm
the
castle
said
one
of
the
ladies
in
evident
alarm
but
her
fears
were
quieted
when
a
young
cadet
came
from
the
building
and
offered
to
show
us
around
can
you
speak
english
i
inquired
no
i
will
find
some
one
he
answered
in
spanish
and
off
he
went
however
we
lost
no
time
waiting
for
his
return
but
went
to
the
door
of
the
castle
and
handed
our
pass
to
the
guard
momento
he
said
and
he
also
disappeared
but
only
to
come
back
accompanied
by
a
handsome
officer
who
told
us
in
broken
english
our
pass
was
good
and
while
the
guard
would
take
us
through
the
castle
he
would
get
us
another
escort
for
the
rest
the
castle
is
being
renovated
for
a
mexican
white
house
a
new
york
firm
is
to
finish
it
at
a
cost
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
our
disappointment
increased
as
we
roamed
through
room
after
room
to
find
all
mementos
of
maximilian
and
carlotta
destroyed
even
what
had
been
their
bedchamber
was
a
total
ruin
the
only
things
that
remain
are
three
poor
pictures
on
the
wall
facing
the
garden
they
had
been
spoiled
and
before
many
hours
the
last
thing
to
recall
the
murdered
emperor
and
the
blighted
empress
would
be
totally
effaced
president
diaz
is
to
move
here
when
the
repairs
are
finished
but
if
they
are
no
faster
with
the
work
in
the
future
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
what
they
have
begun
will
be
before
the
rest
is
completed
and
mexico
will
have
added
two
or
three
more
names
to
its
list
of
presidents
on
top
of
the
castle
is
a
beautiful
garden
full
of
rare
plants
and
handsome
trees
and
shrubbery
fountains
are
plenty
and
statues
of
bronze
and
marble
are
strewn
around
in
profusion
the
stairway
is
made
of
imported
italian
marble
and
the
balconies
of
alternate
blocks
of
italian
and
puebla
marble
the
effect
is
superb
the
famous
leads
down
through
the
castle
from
the
center
of
the
garden
it
is
fenced
in
around
the
month
with
a
brass
railing
and
covered
with
green
vines
magnificent
aquariums
divide
the
flowers
at
intervals
and
the
little
gold
and
silver
fish
play
about
in
the
water
as
if
life
was
all
joy
when
one
looks
around
the
beautiful
landscape
the
romance
of
the
historic
past
fades
before
the
grand
reality
of
the
present
from
this
majestic
spot
one
commands
a
view
of
the
entire
valley
the
soft
green
meadows
the
avenues
of
proud
trees
which
outline
the
gray
roads
that
always
fade
away
at
the
foot
of
the
chain
of
mountains
which
encircle
the
valley
like
a
monstrous
wall
the
faint
blue
and
purple
lines
of
the
mountains
appear
small
and
insignificant
when
the
gaze
wanders
to
those
two
incomparable
beauties
popocatepetl
and
ixtaccihnatl
all
nature
seems
a
prayer
grand
old
popocatapetl
stands
with
its
white
snowy
head
at
the
feet
of
the
white
lady
perhaps
nature
has
assumed
this
tranquilness
while
awaiting
the
old
man
to
say
the
last
sad
words
over
that
beautiful
still
form
at
the
back
of
the
castle
is
the
military
academy
or
west
point
of
mexico
three
hundred
cadets
with
their
officers
are
housed
here
the
school
is
kept
in
the
best
of
order
and
when
the
cadets
finish
their
seven
years
course
they
are
well
prepared
for
future
duties
the
cadets
belong
to
the
best
families
and
number
a
lot
of
handsome
men
the
stairway
which
divides
or
rather
connects
the
two
buildings
is
an
odd
yet
pretty
structure
it
is
built
in
an
arch
to
the
height
of
ten
feet
then
starting
out
in
opposite
directions
are
two
other
arches
which
connect
the
buildings
these
arches
the
stairway
of
course
have
no
supports
whatever
and
one
is
almost
afraid
they
may
cave
in
with
their
weight
when
they
were
finished
some
one
remarked
to
the
builder
they
will
fall
down
if
one
man
mounts
them
bring
a
regiment
and
put
on
them
and
i
guarantee
they
stand
replied
the
builder
this
was
done
and
they
were
found
to
be
as
firm
as
a
mountain
they
are
certainly
one
of
the
prettiest
pieces
of
architectural
work
ever
executed
in
the
library
of
the
academy
are
oil
paintings
of
the
cadets
who
fell
in
defense
of
chapultepec
they
were
handsome
young
boys
and
a
fine
marble
shaft
inclosed
with
an
iron
fence
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
is
erected
in
commemoration
of
their
heroic
deed
the
prettiest
boy
of
the
lot
with
sunny
locks
and
blue
eyes
folded
the
flag
for
which
he
was
fighting
to
his
breast
and
stood
with
a
smile
on
his
face
while
his
enemies
cut
him
into
pieces
he
was
but
thirteen
years
old
his
picture
occupies
a
prominent
place
and
beneath
it
stands
the
flag
dyed
a
dark
crimson
with
his
heart
blood
the
cadets
keep
those
little
memories
green
every
morning
they
place
wreaths
of
flowers
on
the
monument
as
they
march
on
their
way
to
the
meadows
below
to
drill
the
cadets
have
two
queer
pets
a
wild
pig
and
a
monkey
the
latter
is
their
companion
he
performs
in
the
gymnasium
with
them
and
does
some
wonderful
feats
he
is
truly
a
smart
cunning
little
fellow
and
exhibits
much
intelligence
he
is
fond
of
the
boys
and
the
boys
return
his
affection
when
they
come
to
town
on
sundays
they
never
forget
to
take
some
sweetmeats
back
for
him
and
he
never
forgets
to
expect
the
treat
and
he
gets
very
loving
and
confidential
about
that
time
he
hugs
the
returned
youth
and
pries
into
his
pockets
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
though
he
had
been
absent
for
months
every
cadet
has
a
bed
with
his
name
number
on
it
a
combination
desk
and
wardrobe
stands
by
the
side
and
in
the
bottom
is
a
tin
pan
at
they
arise
and
when
the
order
is
given
they
take
up
their
tin
pans
and
march
out
to
the
side
of
the
building
from
a
large
basin
they
take
the
water
and
placing
their
pans
on
a
stone
bench
many
yards
long
they
wash
themselves
on
sundays
they
can
go
to
to
town
to
see
their
relatives
or
do
anything
they
wish

punishment
they
are
taught
french

have
not
the

objection
to
flirting
though
they
are
short
in
stature
they
have
good
forms
and
are
splendid

in

they
are
the

of
the

the

as
a
people
have
an
inordinate
passion
for
gambling
they
gamble
on
everything
poor
peons
have
been
known
when
their
money
was
gone
to
take
the
rags
off
their
backs
and
pawn
them
in
order
to
get
a
few
cents
to
lose
men
possessing
thousands

gone
into
houses
at
night
to
be
hauled
away
in
the
morning
a
corpse
without
a
dollar
to
pay
funeral
expenses
gambling
reached
such
a
stage
that
the
government
saw
it
must
interfere
consequently
they
prohibited
all
street
gambling
and
started
lotteries
in
which
prizes
are
drawn
every
other
day
the
main
prizes
range
from
to
crippled
blind
aged
men
and
women
are
on
the
streets
at
all
hours
selling
numbered
strips

tissue
paper
marked

the
seller
wears
a
brass
badge
in
the
shape
of
a

proof
that
he
or
she
is
employed
by
the
government
no
trouble
is
experienced
in
selling
the
tickets
as
everybody
buys
foreigners
as
well
as
mexicans
the
tickets
range
from
twelve
cents
to
dollars
when
the
drawing
is
held
a
printed
list
showing
the
fortunate
numbers
is
posted
in
the
court
people
of
all
nationalities
and
in
all
stages
of
dress
crowd
around
the
notice
many
turn
away
unhappy
while
some
few
smile
over
their
gains
it
is
said
the
proceeds
are
devoted
to
useful
and
charitable
works
the
income
at
any
rate
must
be
a
princely
one
gambling
houses
are
also
run
on
a
large
scale
they
are
licensed
by
the
government
once
every
year
in
the
month
of

gamblers

and

during

all
are

of

at

every

ladies
in

men
on
horseback
the
poor
in
the
street
cars
all
bound
for
the
one
destination
tacubaya
present
a
beautiful
sight
from
the
energy
displayed
the
hurry
to
pass
one
another
the
evident
desire
to
get
there
first
one
would
think
it
the
first
holiday
they
had
had
for
years
and
all
were
determined
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
to
reach
the
scene
the
tourist
must
take
a
drive
along
a
wide
road
bordered
on
either
side
with
trees
of
luxurious
growth
and
shade
beneath
which
beautiful
calla
lilies
and
geraniums
lift
their
pretty
heads
in
the
perfect
of
naturalness
and
liberty
dotted
here
and
there
over
the
lovely
valley
are
green
fields
adobe
huts
and
whitewashed
churches
with
superb
chapultepec
ever
in
view
as
a
crown
or
guard
to
the
vast
valley
beneath
the
gates
of
chapultepec
with
its
sentinels
and
mounted
guards
are
passed
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
are
in
tacubaya
we
will
have
to
alight
here
said
our
guide
the
streets
are
so
full
it
is
impossible
to
drive
through
impossible
to
drive
it
was
almost
impossible
to
walk
as
we
stepped
from
the
carriage
several
peons
who
had
come
to
meet
us
knelt
on
the
ground
and
spread
out
their
serapes
before
them
displaying
a
few
silver
dollars
big
copper
one
and
two
cent
pieces
and
three
cards
the
cards
were
deftly
crossed
face
downward
one
after
another
with
astonishing
rapidity
while
the
tosser
kept
singing
out
some
unintelligible
stuff
apparently
which
will
you
bet
on
quickly
a
peon
steps
forward
and
lays
a
bill
on
one
card
the
tosser
shuffles
again
the
man
wins
and
puts
many
silver
dollars
in
his
pocket
this
excites
the
watching
crowd
which
presses
forward
and
many
women
and
men
lay
down
their
money
on
certain
cards
only
to
see
it
go
into
the
pile
of
the
tosser
one
failure
does
not
discourage
them
but
they
try
as
long
as
their
money
lasts
for
it
is
impossible
to
win
the
tosser
has
one
or
two
accomplices
who
win
the
first
money
to
excite
the
crowd
or
again
to
increase
their
waning
energy
the
tosser
and
his
accomplices
will
follow
americans
or
greenoes
as
they
call
us
for
squares
when
you
pause
they
prostrate
themselves
before
you
the
always
wins
and
tries
to
induce
the
stranger
to
play
even
pinches
off
the
corner
of
the
card
saying
it
will
win
bet
on
it
senor
try
your
hand
senorita
you
will
be
lucky
whispers
the
accomplice
as
he
gazes
at
you
in
the
most
solemn
manner
women
who
smell
strongly
of
pulque
with
disheveled
hair
and
dirty
clothes
beg
for
money
to
try
their
luck
each
side
of
the
street
is
filled
with
tents
in
the
center
and
along
the
houses
are
women
squatted
on
the
ground
nursing
their
babies
and
selling
their
wares
which
consist
of
everything
ugly
some
build
little
charcoal
fires
above
it
suspend
a
flat
pan
and
on
it
fry
some
sort
of
horrible
cakes
and
red
pepper
which
are
sold
to
the
gamblers
at
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
sat
an
ugly
dirty
woman
from
a
big
earthen
jar
by
her
side
she
dealt
out
pulque
to
the
thirsty
people
the
jar
was
replenished
repeatedly
from
filled
pig
skins
at
another
place
tomatoes
and
salad
were
laid
out
in
little
piles
on
the
ground
a
little
naked
babe
lay
asleep
on
a
piece
of
matting
and
a
woman
was
busy
at
the
head
of
another
not
reading
her
bumps
but
taking
the
living
off
the
living
and
she
did
not
have
to
hunt
hard
either
similar
scenes
repeated
themselves
until
one
longed
for
something
new
the
restaurants
were
numerous
a
piece
of
matting
spread
on
the
ground
constituted
the
tables
with
the
exception
of
three
old
wrecks
that
could
hardly
stand
cups
of
all
shapes
but
none
whole
lay
claim
to
being
the
only
dishes
in
sight
large
clay
jars
tin
boilers
were
the
coffee
urns
among
all
the
mob
that
gathers
here
a
fight
is
an
thing
it
is
old
california
repeated
said
joaquin
miller
with
the
rough
people
left
out
rough
in
a
certain
sense
they
are
and
ignorant
yet
far
surpassing
the
same
class
of
people
in
the
states
they
possess
a
kindness
and
gentleness
for
one
another
the
police
carried
one
woman
who
was
paralyzed
from
pulque
as
tenderly
as
if
she
were
their
mother
while
a
sympathizing
crowd
followed
two
peons
supported
between
them
a
pulque
victim
who
was
so
happy
that
his
spirits
found
vent
in
trying
to
sing
a
hiccough
song
another
peon
only
half
sober
got
his
drunken
companion
on
his
back
and
trudged
off
in
a
wavering
manner
for
his
home
in
the
tents
along
the
street
a
second
class
of
people
gamble
some
tables
have
painted
on
them
three
faces
a
red
one
with
a
white
and
green
one
on
either
side
on
which
the
men
gamble
musicians
with
string
instruments
furnish
pleasing
airs
and
women
in
picturesque
costumes
do
the
singing
and
dancing
the
most
popular
song
is
i
am
a
pure
mexican
no
spanish
blood
in
me
the
people
scorn
the
idea
of
spanish
blood
and
boast
of
being
of
pure
indian
descent
over
the
top
of
high
walls
peep
the
green
trees
and
the
vines
crawl
over
hanging
low
down
on
the
outside
enter
the
gateway
and
you
will
see
a
garden
as
fine
as
any
city
park
a
smooth
walk
leads
to
all
sorts
of
cunning
little
nooks
large
trees
spread
out
their
heavy
arms
the
perfume
of
thousands
of
beautiful
flowers

the
air

fountains
mingle
their
music
with
the
exquisite
melody
of
the
string
bands
placed
at
intervals
throughout
the
grounds
statues
glisten
against
the
green
foliage
men
and
finely
clad
women
are
visible
on
every
spot
everything
animate
and
inanimate
adds
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
beautiful
scene
in
the
buildings
which
are
decorated
outside
with
pictures
from
happy
scones
in

of

these

are
left
unguarded
people
go
in
and
out
at
pleasure
but
all
are
too
honorable
to
take
one
piece
ladies

stand
around
smoking
their
cigarettes
and
betting

in
a
short
time
the
possessor
of

never
changed

and
after
getting
the
pot
together
he
exchanged
it
for
greenbacks
and
walked
off

fine

in

one
gambling
hall
is
hung
with
spanish
moss
in
the
shape
of
a
tent
which
reflects
in
the
mirrors
forming
the
walls
it
is
beautiful
and
reminds
one
forcibly
of
what
fairyland
is
supposed
to
be
every
large
house
has
a
notice
posted
informing
patrons
that
they
furnish
free
of
charge
conveyances
for
the
city
at
late
hours
one
man
almost
broke
the
bank
and
had
to
get
a
wagon
to
haul
his
money
to
mexico
others
won
and
but
notwithstanding
this
one
house
made
the
first
ten
days
electric
lights
enable
the
players
to
keep
the
game
up
all
night
and
unique
torches
furnish
just
enough
light
in
the
gardens
to
show
the
way
and
fascinate
the
sentimental
tired
at
last
we
wandered
forth
and
visited
the
beautiful
old
cathedral
which
all
mexican
towns
possess
walked
through
several
plazas
and
examined
the
fine
fountains
flowers
and
monuments
and
at
last
traveled
to
the
top
of
the
hill
in
order
to
view
the
country
around
about
seated
on
the
bank
of
the
military
road
we
watched
the
indians
going
to
and
from
the
city
first
came
a
drove
of
burros
walking
quite
briskly
as
if
they
feared
the
load
left
behind
might
catch
up
and
insist
again
on
being
carried
a
number
of
women
wrapped
up
in
a
straight
piece
of
flannel
and
a
piece
on
their
heads
in
the
style
of
the
peasant
girl
in
the
mascot
passed
by
on
their
back
were
huge
bundles
of
wood
and
buenas

senora
buenas
noches
senorita
buenas
noches
senors
they
cried
out
pleasantly
as
their
bare
feet
raised
enough
dust
to
encircle
them
their
black
eyes
gazed
on
us
in
a
friendly
manner
and
their
lovely
white
teeth
glistened
in
a
cordial
smile
poor
human
beasts
of
burden
give
the
little
one
some
money
we
whispered
here
this
is
yours
he
called
in
spanish
holding
forth
a
silver
dollar
the
smile
faded
from
her
face
gracias
no
senor
and
she
quickly
passed
on
too
proud
to
accept
what
in
all
probability
was
more
than
she
ever
owned
the
sun
had
long
gone
down
dark
clouds
draped
the
white
lady
chapultepec
looked
dim
and
hazy
with
regret
we
left
our
prominent
position
passed
the
handsome
palaces
of
escandon
mier
y
celis
and
barron
walked
through
one
of
the
handsomest
villages
in
mexico
tacubaya
and
in
a
few
moments
reached
our
carriage
homeward
bound
leaving
the
feast
of
the
gamblers
just
in
the
height
of
its
glory
chapter
xvii
feast
of
flowers
and
lenten
celebrations
if
they
had
put
both
in
a
kettle
and
after
constant
stirring
poured
the
contents
out
there
would
not
have
been
more
of
a
mixture
of
religion
and
amusement
than
there
was
during
lent
to
a
it
looked
as
if
the
two
forces
were
waging
a
battle
to
see
which
would
predominate
it
was
very
interesting
more
so
from
the
fact
that
in
no
other
place
on
earth
is
lent
celebrated
like
it
is
in
the
city
of
mexico
i
think
i
told
you
how
the
carnival
season
opened
with
balls
picnics
and
driving
in
full
dress
on
the
paseo
then
suddenly
everything
collapsed
and
the
city
put
on
somber
robes
bells
tolled
forth
from
morning
until
night
and
every
other
day
was
a
saint
day
when
catholic
or
otherwise
we
were
compelled
to
fast
the
stores
closed
and
everything
came
to
a
standstill
all
the
night
previous
fireworks
were
set
off
and
revolvers
cracked
until
one
wildest
wish
was
that
their
inventors
had
never
been
born
one
morning
i
was
surprised
to
learn
i
could
not
have
any
coffee
the
solitary
cup
which
constitutes
our
dainty
delicious
breakfast
here
my
limited
spanish
prevented
my
giving
vent
to
my
feelings
and
so
i
nursed
my
righteous
wrath
while
i
took
observations
the
whole
house
was
closed
and
darkened
the
mirrors
were
covered
with
purple
cloths
and
every
little
ornament
which
had
hitherto
decorated
the
house
was
missing
all
the
people
of
the
household
were
dressed
in
black
talked
in
whispers
and
walked
around
on
their
tiptoes
came
and
we
sat
down
to
a
bit
of
dry
toast
butter
is
an
thing
black
coffee
chile
or
red
pepper
and
beans
by
this
time
i
began
to
get
shaky
especially
as
they
did
not
talk
and
pulque
was
dispensed
with
after
saying
some
one
must
be
dead
they
must
have
gotten
into
some
kind
of
trouble
and
are
trying
to
make
believe
they
are
away
i
decided
to
quit
guessing
and
try
to
find
out
the
true
cause
of
these
strange
doings
finally
i
decided
to
see
if
any
of
my
mexican
bears
wore
visible
and
going
through
the
parlor
i
opened
the
window
leading
to
the
balcony
just
as
i
had
removed
all
the
monstrous
bars
my
landlady
came
rushing
to
me
with
a
burning
candle
in
one
hand
and
beads
in
another
and
in
louder
tones
than
she
had
spoken
before
she
besought
me
not
to
open
the
window
completely
mystified
and
feeling
sure
they
had
done
some
terrible
deed
i
closed
the
bars
with
one
longing
sigh
to
my
bears
and
then
catching
her
by
the
shoulder
asked
in
trembling
tones
tell
me
what
have
you
done
no
comprehende
she
ejaculated
looking
at
me
as
if
i
had
lost
my
senses
porque
i
asked
pulling
her
around
and
pointing
to
the
bare
tables
and
cabinets
the
draped
mirrors
the
barred
shutters
i
am
sad
because
it
is
my
saint
day
and
my
mother
day
she
explained
and
she
took
me
into
her
room
where
everything
was
draped
in
somber
colors
below
the
picture
of
her
mother
were
a
number
of
burning
candles
placed
around
a
large
cross
before
this
cross
the
rest
of
the
family
were
on
their
knees
and
as
i
slipped
out
and
closed
the
door
i
saw
her
sink
down
beside
them
with
a
look
of
submission
on
her
face
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
i
am
glad
that
before
a
similar
day
rolls
around
i
shall
be
over
the
rio
grande
and
doubtless
at
home
holy
week
began
on
piernes
de
dolores
friday
of
sorrow
april
as
early
as
in
the
morning
the
bells
began
to
toll
and
people
flocked
to
the
churches
at
five
we
started
for
la
viga
where
this
day
is
celebrated
by
the
feast
of
the
flowers
or
paseo
de
las
flores
flower
promenade
even
at
that
hour
the
way
was
crowded
with
people
laden
with
flowers
when
we
reached
la
viga
we
found
it
filled
with
canoes
and
boats
burdened
with
beautiful
flowers
of
every
description
as
far
as
we
could
see
up
la
viga
it
was
the
same
picturesque
people
paddling
their
equally
picturesque
boats
in
and
out
and
around
the
crowd
some
of
the
boats
were
ready
for
hire
they
had
awnings
made
of
cane
covered
with
ferns
and
flowers
very
few
could
resist
their
inviting
appearance
and
by
nine
there
was
not
an
empty
boat
to
be
found
along
the
fragrant
grassy
banks
sat
flower
girls
surrounded
by
heaps
of
ferns
creamy
lilies
delicious
pinks
of
hundreds
of
shades
geraniums
and
fuchsias
of
wonderful
size
and
color
and
roses
whose
colors
sizes
and
perfumes
bewildered
me
honeysuckles
roses
lilies
and
poppies
were
woven
into
wreaths
which
people
bought
and
wore
on
their
heads
and
around
their
shoulders
were
about
as
plentiful
as
the
flowers
and
everything
that
was
ever
made
in
mexico
was
here
for
sale
they
did
a
big
business
too
gay
crowds
would
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
take
breakfast
off
of
a
straw
petate
as
merrily
as
if
in
the
finest
some
of
these
booths
were
fixed
up
with
canvas
covers
and
flower
sides
other
long
booths
were
fitted
up
in
the
same
manner
hung
with
the
mexican
colors
and
filled
with
chairs
where
the
tired
could
pay
a
medio
six
and
one
quarter
cents
and
sit
down
three
bands
in
holiday
attire
sent
forth
lovely
strains
alternately
from
similar
booths
the
trees
on
either
side
kept
the
paseo
shady
it
was
filled
with
people
riding
and
driving
the
riders
who
numbered
many
ladies
formed
a
line
in
the
center
and
the
carriages
drove
around
and
around
down
one
way
and
up
the
other
most
of
those
out
driving
alighted
and
mingled
with
the
masses
it
was
certainly
a
most
enjoyable
scene
at
several
places
we
found
things
for
sale
which
looked
like
dahlias
with
a
strange
mixture
of
colors
none
could
determine
just
what
they
were
but
presently
we
found
a
man
and
woman
manufacturing
them
they
were
nothing
more
or
less
than
long
radishes
which
with
his
penknife
the
man
turned
into
all
kinds
of
flowers
as
well
as
crosses
and
other
designs
the
woman
delicately
touched
one
part
one
color
another
another
until
they
formed
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
many
strange
sights
on
la
viga
there
was
quite
a
rush
for
them
and
the
happy
purchasers
triumphantly
carried
them
off
while
the
less
fortunate
looked
on
with
regret
i
got
a
number
but
before
the
next
morning
their
beauty
had
departed
forever
and
their
perfume
was
loud
and
unmistakable
of
course
there
were
plenty
of
venders
and
beggars
there
the
venders
had
wax
figures
representing
ballet
dancers
angels
any
sort
of
female
that
was
skimp
in
her
wearing
apparel
others
had
men
fighting
bulls
monkeys
on
horseback
baby
dolls
made
of
rags
and
every
little
thing
which
could
be
invented
this
feast
lasted
until
sunday
evening
and
there
was
not
a
moment
from
three
friday
morning
until
twelve
sunday
night
but
what
the
place
was
crowded
worse
than
barnum
show
in
its
brightest
days
the
prettiest
sight
was
when
the
people
returned
to
town
every
carriage
even
to
the
driver
seat
was
filled
with
flowers
the
horses
and
riders
were
decorated
with
wreaths
and
in
this
manner
they
all
returned
to
their
homes
i
must
describe
one
rider
to
you
before
i
leave
la
viga
he
rode
a
beautiful
black
horse
the
mexican
saddle
was
a
bright
deep
yellow
covered
with
silver
ornaments
and
a
bright
sword
dangled
at
the
side
the
bridle
was
entirely
of
silver
even
to
the
reins
and
silver
cord
and
tassels
decorated
the
horse
neck
the
rider
pants
were
black
and
fitted
as
if
he
had
been
poured
into
them
a
row
of
silver
buttons
at
least
the
size
of
reached
from
waist
to
knee
where
they
were
met
by
high
boots
an
immense
silver
spur
completed
that
part
his
vest
was
yellow
velvet
his
coat
blue
and
his
wide
sombrero
red
all
heavily
trimmed
with
silver
while
at
the
back
peeping
beneath
his
coat
were
two
mammoth
revolvers
he
was
the
most
gorgeous
butterfly
i
ever
saw
and
attracted
attention
from
mexicans
as
well
as
myself
sunday
was
observed
by
the
churches
as
well
as
on
la
viga
it
was
palm
sunday
and
the
indians
had
made
pretty
things
out
of
dry
palms
which
they
sold
to
the
people
for
from
a
real
twelve
and
one
half
cents
up
to
cinco
pesos
the
devout
took
these
to
church
and
had
them
blessed
and
after
carrying
them
home
they
were
fixed
to
the
bars
of
windows
the
balconies
and
above
the
doors
where
they
will
stay
for
the
whole
year
they
say
they
keep
the
devil
out
and
that
is
their
reason
for
using
them
excursion
trains
were
run
in
from
all
the
connecting
points
people
appeared
in
the
most
gorgeous
hues
and
venders
had
no
trouble
in
selling
the
effigies
they
carried
holy
thursday
came
and
the
bells
tolled
from
early
morning
until
ten
when
every
one
was
silent
in
sorrow
for
the
crucifixion
mass
was
said
in
the
morning
and
all
turned
out
to
attend
divine
service
in
the
alameda
zocola
and
paseo
bands
to
the
number
of
three
or
four
delighted
their
hearers
it
seemed
rather
strange
to
stand
within
the
church
door
and
hear
the
voice
of
the
priest
repeating
mass
the
piano
playing
a
soft
prelude
no
pipe
organs
are
permitted
during
holy
week
and
the
band
mingling
the
lively
strains
of
some
light
opera
or
something
equally
ridiculous
with
this
solemn
service
the
altars
were
all
hung
with
squares
of
silver
or
gold
tinsel
which
were
constantly
in
motion
thousands
of
candles
lighted
up
the
gloomy
building
and
christ
and
the
virgin
were
the
only
images
in
sight
at
in
the
afternoon
they
brought
in
what
they
said
were
the
oldest
and
most
neglected
of
beggars
the
priest
washed
their
feet
and
after
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
holy
oil
upon
them
they
were
allowed
to
depart
i
noticed
these
men
feet
had
been
washed
recently
and
also
that
there
were
dirtier
and
poorer
people
in
the
audience
however
the
washer
took
good
care
not
to
touch
the
feet
without
an
intervening
towel
at
night
the
churches
were
brilliantly
illuminated
it
would
be
hard
to
give
an
estimate
of
the
candles
required
but
i
fully
believe
that
in
some
of
the
big
edifices
would
not
be
a
bad
guess
the
devout
were
all
on
their
knees
and
everything
was
as
silent
as
death
except
the
piano
which
still
kept
up
its
soft
soothing
melody
on
good
friday
all
the
men
and
women
were
dressed
in
black
and
every
church
was
draped
with
purple
the
virgin
was
dressed
in
heavy
black
velvet
the
poor
indians
laid
flowers
money
and
candles
around
the
image
and
they
could
not
have
been
more
deeply
touched
had
the
crucifixion
taken
place
then
instead
of
so
many
hundred
years
ago
they
kissed
her
feet
her
garments
and
the
floor
before
her
and
showed
in
a
thousand
humble
ways
their
love
and
devotion
the
ceremony
of
the
tres
horas
three
hours
was
celebrated
in
texcoco
first
a
lot
of
masked
men
ran
around
the
yard
with
sticks
beating
the
bushes
trees
and
flowers
as
though
in
search
of
something
then
one
of
the
men
who
was
far
from
representing
christ
in
form
feature
or
complexion
took
a
heavy
wooden
cross
on
his
shoulders
and
walked
into
the
church
being
lashed
with
a
leather
strap
by
the
masked
men
when
he
fell
the
people
covered
their
faces
and
groaned
he
fell
three
times
before
reaching
the
altar
where
an
effigy
was
nailed
to
the
cross
the
sounds
of
the
hammer
and
groans
and
cries
of
the
people
made
one
feel
as
if
somebody
had
dropped
a
piece
of
ice
down
their
back
finally
amid
the
most
heartrending
cries
the
cross
was
raised
and
the
ceremony
was
over
all
day
wagons
horses
boxes
everything
in
the
toy
line
with
a
racket
in
them
were
sold
to
the
people
all
the
venders
were
located
around
the
cathedral
and
zocolo
and
the
din
could
be
heard
several
squares
away
these
are
called
matracas
when
christ
was
on
earth
they
say
they
had
no
bells
with
which
to
call
the
people
to
mass
so
these
matracas
were
made
and
a
number
of
men
would
promenade
the
streets
swinging
them
around
to
keep
up
the
incessant
cracking
the
men
would
cry
out
the
hour
has
come
for
mass
the
hour
has
come
for
mass
and
the
faithful
would
hurry
away
to
count
their
beads
and
say
their
prayers
a
foreigner
told
me
this
custom
was
still
in
vogue
in
some
parts
of
his
country
france
during
holy
week
hideous
effigies
called
judas
were
for
sale
little
ones
made
of
lead
were
bought
and
tied
to
the
the
parasol
the
bracelet
the
belt
or
any
other
convenient
place
some
made
of
plaster
of
paris
and
paper
from
three
inches
to
twelve
feet
long
were
bought
by
old
and
young
and
carried
home
for
saturday
sabado
de
gloria
saturday
of
glory
came
bright
and
sunny
all
along
the
streets
were
strung
long
judases
some
having
pasted
on
them
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
for
which
he
betrayed
christ
the
image
was
made
in
the
most
horrible
form
as
a
negro
devil
monkey
half
beast
half
human
every
form
that
could
possibly
be
thought
of
at
the
bells
began
to
ring
merrily
as
though
rejoicing
over
the
fate
of
judas
and
a
match
was
applied
to
every
image
in
the
town
they
were
all
filled
with
powder
and
with
one
accord
there
was
a
universal
bursting
and
tearing
and
rejoicing
throughout
the
city
as
fervent
as
had
been
their
devotion
to
the
virgin
just
as
strong
was
their
hatred
of
judas
even
the
smallest
scraps
they
tramped
upon
by
gay
colors
were
resumed
carriages
which
had
been
rigorously
kept
out
of
sight
came
forth
and
were
flying
down
the
paseo
as
if
glad
that
the
time
of
quietness
was
past
all
places
of
amusement
which
had
been
closed
during
lent
began
sticking
up
posters
announcing
a
grand
opening
on
the
next
sunday
evening
the
noise
of
the
matracas
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
gradually
ceased
the
wind
picked
up
the
stray
pieces
of
judases
played
with
them
awhile
and
then
carried
them
out
of
sight
the
venders
who
had
jammed
the
zocalo
gradually
disappeared
the
music
in
the
different
parks
ceased
and
lent
seemed
as
far
gone
by
the
time
rang
forth
as
though
six
months
had
passed
such
is
life
on
sunday
the
theaters
circus
and
were
well
attended
the
were
advertised
as
the
last
of
the
season
the
one
i
attended
was
excellent
the
bulls
were
good
ones
and
some
very
new
and
striking
features
were
introduced
one
man
sat
down
on
a
chair
in
the
center
of
the
ring
with
two
banderillas
in
his
hand
the
door
was
opened
and
the
bull
rushed
in
and
at
him
he
sat
there
and
as
it
put
down
its
head
to
gore
him
he
stuck
the
banderillas
into
its
neck
and
sprung
aside
while
the
bull
knocked
the
chair
into
atoms
everybody
cheered
and
threw
the
fellow
money
and
cigars
after
this
toro
had
been
dispatched
one
man
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
another
stood
over
him
keeping
his
head
between
his
legs
again
they
opened
the
door
and
let
a
toro
in
it
rushed
for
the
men
but
the
one
standing
stuck
the
banderillas
into
it
with
such
force
that
it
roared
with
pain
and
took
after
one
of
the
other
fighters
in
the
ring
leaving
the
two
men
unhurt
the
very
daring
of
this
delighted
the
people
for
if
the
man
had
missed
the
bull
both
of
them
would
have
been
killed
without
the
least
trouble
one
toro
had
horns
about
four
feet
wide
and
at
the
first
plunge
it
killed
one
horse
then
it
caught
another
horse
and
threw
it
on
its
back
the
rider
underneath
the
fighters
tried
to
draw
it
off
but
it
stayed
there
until
the
horse
was
dead
all
that
could
be
seen
of
the
rider
was
his
head
which
he
tried
vainly
to
shield
with
his
arms
they
carried
him
off
for
dead
this
toro
was
very
hard
to
kill
it
required
seven
lunges
of
the
sword
to
convert
him
into
beef
one
toro
refused
to
fight
and
when
stuck
with
a
sharp
pica
he
jumped
over
the
fence
and
was
with
the
audience
such
a
scrambling
most
of
the
people
threw
themselves
into
the
ring
about
the
first
ones
to
go
being
the
guards
who
are
placed
around
to
take
care
of
the
people
it
was
quite
a
while
before
quiet
was
restored
and
the
toro
lassoed
and
removed
have
lasted
longer
this
season
than
ever
before
as
it
is
impossible
to
fight
during
the
rainy
season
now
a
man
comes
forward
and
says
he
is
going
to
cover
his
ring
and
have
fights
all
summer
this
will
make
the
light
in
the
ring
dim
and
the
fighters
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
not
being
able
to
calculate
their
distances
it
will
also
make
the
fights
more
dangerous
and
more
interesting
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
people
are
delighted
at
the
prospect
last
sunday
one
man
got
so
excited
over
the
big
toro
fighting
that
when
it
was
to
be
stabbed
he
got
down
into
the
ring
and
taking
off
his
high
silk
hat
asked
the
judge
permission
to
do
the
work
the
audience
rose
to
their
feet
and
shouted
yes
yes
but
the
judge
was
unkind
enough
to
refuse
and
thereby
deprived
us
of
seeing
a
fellow
in
broadcloth
gored
because
he
thought
he
could
kill
a
toro
congress
is
in
full
session
now
the
other
day
they
passed
a
bill
which
was
strongly
opposed
it
is
to
the
effect
that
any
one
caught
meddling
with
the
railroads
will
be
shot
down
instantly
without
a
warning
and
without
a
trial
doubtless
many
will
say
that
it
is
a
law
when
they
think
of
the
wrongs
committed
on
the
railways
in
mexico
but
it
is
such
a
law
as
will
allow
thousands
of
mexicans
whose
honor
desires
satisfaction
to
take
advantage
of
it
the
victim
is
shot
and
after
he
is
dead
the
shooter
steps
forward
and
swears
that
he
saw
him
meddling
with
the
railways
or
knew
he
had
designs
on
them
this
is
all
he
has
to
do
to
be
freed
of
the
murder
while
we
believe
in
dealing
out
unmerciful
punishment
to
train
wreckers
yet
this
law
is
fit
only
for
uncivilized
countries
and
least
of
all
for
mexico
where
people
shoot
on
the
least
provocation
ofttimes
just
for
amusement
or
to
test
their
unerring
aim
piercing
the
brain
or
heart
every
time
it
is
certainly
a
grand
chance
for
those
who
have
a
desire
for
revenge
to
obtain
it
and
go
however
the
law
is
only
to
be
tried
for
one
year
and
if
it
proves
good
it
will
be
adopted
permanently
now
is
the
time
for
those
who
claim
the
country
is
ruined
by
a
ring
to
remove
some
of
its
links
especially
the
key
and
padlock
and
by
doing
so
once
again
proclaim
liberty
and
prove
to
the
people
that
the
shoot
without
trial
law

chapter
xviii
guadalupe
and
its
romantic
legend
we
went
up
to
the
zocalo
to
take
a
car
for
guadalupe
all
the
street
cars
start
from
this
center
and
on
some
lines
trains
of
three
to
ten
in
number
are
made
up
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
resist
the
bandits
who
sometimes
attack
them
at
least
so
the
corporation
claims
we
determined
to
try
a
car
in
order
to
find
out
what
they
were
like
our
party
seated
ourselves
and
watched
the
crowd
as
they
came
surging
in
two
big
fellows
dressed
in
buckskin
suits
and
wearing
broad
sombreros
who
sat
opposite
never
removed
their
gaze
from
us
a
pretty
little
girl
and
an
old
man
who
sported
a
hat
about
two
inches
high
in
the
brim
deposited
themselves
on
one
side
of
us
and
a
black
old
fellow
occupied
the
other
when
the
car
was
about
filled
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
followed
by
her
mother
and
husband
came
in
the
women
sat
down
facing
us
while
the
husband
who
wore
a
linen
suit
pretty
dirty
too
and
carried
a
large
purple
woolen
serape
of
which
he
seemed
very
proud
wedged
himself
in
between
us
and
the
piece
of
parchment
on
our
left
side
we
were
inclined
to
resent
this
close
contact
and
were
beginning
to
regret
we
had
not
taken
the
other
car
where
the
people
are
a
shade
cleaner
when
a
lot
of
indian
women
with
babies
and
bundles
crowded
in
and
with
a
sudden
rush
which
knocked
the
standing
ones
on
to
the
laps
of
the
others
we
were
off
at
a
gait
the
women
sat
down
on
the
floor
of
the
car
except
one
who
was
dressed
a
little
better
than
the
others
she
came
up
to
the
dirty
indian
by
my
side
and
told
him
to
get
up
he
was
about
to
do
so
as
an
utterance
of
thanks
escaped
our
lips
when
his
and
wife
commanded
him
to
sit
down
again
this
he
did
in
all
humbleness
but
the
woman
in
black
commanded
him
to
rise
as
he
had
no
money
to
pay
his
fare
his
ire
was
up
however
and
she
ordered
him
to
display
his
wealth
he
took
out
a
handkerchief
untied
the
corner
and
displayed
one
silver
dollar
and
some
small
change
then
the
old
lady
dived
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
untying
a
similar
handkerchief
displayed
her
worldly
all
the
woman
in
black
was
convinced
she
had
struck
the
wrong
man
so
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
related
her
side
of
the
story
to
the
people
in
her
end
of
the
car
while
the
dealt
out
the
same
dose
at
the
other
end
the
conductor
came
in
and
straddling
over
the
women
on
the
floor
sold
the
tickets
for
six
and
a
half
cents
another
conductor
followed
to
collect
the
same
and
soon
we
reached
our
destination
guadalupe
is
the
holiest
shrine
in
mexico
it
is
the
scene
of
a
tradition
that
is
never
doubted
for
an
instant
by
the
people
in
the
virgin
appeared
one
evening
to
a
poor
peon
juan
diego
and
told
him
to
go
to
some
wealthy
man
and
say
it
was
her
will
that
a
church
be
built
on
that
spot
the
indian
in
a
great
fright
obeyed
her
command
but
the
wealthy
fellow
refused
to
put
credence
in
the
incredulous
story
so
the
peon
returned
and
told
the
virgin
who
was
still
there
of
his
failure
she
told
him
to
return
and
show
his
tilma
apron
as
proof
the
amazed
fellow
did
so
and
the
light
disclosed
the
picture
of
the
virgin
painted
on
the
apron
still
the
unbeliever
doubted
and
the
virgin
sent
for
the
third
time
a
bunch
of
fresh
roses
such
as
never
before
grew
in
this
country
the
infidel
took
the
flowers
and
the
picture
of
the
virgin
fell
from
the
heart
of
a
rose
he
was
convinced
and
built
a
large
church
on
the
spot
where
the
virgin
appeared
the
church
is
a
fine
one
decorated
with
statues
paintings
and
gold
the
silver
railing
weighs
tons
and
is
composed
of
a
metal
composite
the
church
authorities
have
received
numerous
offers
for
this
rich
relic
some
persons
desired
to
replace
the
railing
with
one
of
solid
silver
but
this
bargain
was
not
accepted
diego
apron
is
above
the
altar
in
a
frame
on
it
is
painted
a
picture
of
the
virgin
but
to
say
the
very
least
it
was
not
drawn
by
a
master
hand
the
bunch
of
roses
which
they
claim
never
fades
is
also
shown
in
a
glass
vase
and
is
gazed
on
with
reverence
by
the
believers
some
unbelievers
some
people
doubt
everything
say
fresh
roses
are
put
in
every
day
but
they
are
probably
preserved
it
is
the
common
belief
that
anything
asked
of
the
virgin
of
guadalupe
is
granted
i
have
seen
people
pray
with
their
hands
outstretched
and
after
awhile
murmur
gracious
gracious
and
get
up
as
if
the
favor
had
been
received
women
ofttimes
kiss
the
floor
when
they
think
they
have
received
mercy
at
the
hands
of
their
dear
saint
near
the
door
are
hundreds
of
rude
oil
paintings
representing
scenes
in
which
the
virgin
has
saved
the
lives
of
people
one
man
fell
from
a
window
and
by
murmuring
the
virgin
name
escaped
uninjured
another
was
not
crushed
to
death
although
his
horse
fell
on
him
one
was
released
from
prison
many
from
fatal
sicknesses
and
hundreds
of
canes
and
crutches
in
the
corner
testify
to
the
many
who
have
been
healed
a
little
green
plaza
filled
with
tall
trees
beautiful
flowers
and
flowing
fountains
separates
the
church
of
the
virgin
of
guadalupe
from
another
which
in
order
to
have
some
attraction
boasts
of
a
well
in
the
vestibule
which
is
ever
boiling
up
its
muddy
water
the
water
cures
any
disease
so
they
say
and
at
any
time
a
crowd
is
found
around
its
magic
brim
filling
jars
bottles
and
pitchers
to
take
home
or
supping
from
the
copper
bowl
that
is
chained
to
the
iron
bars
that
cover
the
well
very
few
can
suppress
the
look
of
disgust
when
they
try
to
swallow
the
vile
stuff
with
the
qualities
nor
are
these
all
the
churches
of
guadalupe
away
up
on
the
top
of
a
pile
of
rocks
some
hundred
feet
in
height
is
the
oldest
church
of
the
three
it
is
quite
small
and
filled
with
quaint
paintings
at
the
back
of
it
is
the
graveyard
where
lies
the
body
of
santa
anna
and
looking
down
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
tourist
can
see
the
building
where
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
with
the
americans
in
it
is
now
used
as
the
barracks
at
one
side
of
the
church
is
one
of
the
queer
monuments
raised
in
honor
of
the
virgin
the
escandon
family
who
are
believed
to
be
worth
some
once
had
a
vessel
out
to
sea
the
loss
of
which
would
have
put
them
in
bankruptcy
there
were
great
storms
and
the
vessel
had
been
overdue
so
long
that
everybody
gave
it
up
for
lost
the
escandons
went
to
the
church
in
a
body
and
prayed
to
the
virgin
to
restore
their
property
and
they
would
in
return
build
in
her
honor
a
stone
sail
it
must
have
been
considered
a
big
inducement
for
a
few
days
after
the
ship
came
in
safe
and
the
stone
sail
stands
a
memento
of
the
virgin
goodness
down
on
the
other
side
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
grotto
which
perhaps
is
the
only
one
of
the
kind
in
the
world
a
poor
indian
formed
the
rough
side
of
the
stone
hill
into
arches
benches
cunning
little
summer
houses
and
all
sorts
of
retreats
this
alone
would
not
have
been
very
attractive
so
he
came
to
town
and
gathered
up
all
the
pieces
of
china
glassware
and
with
a
cement
he
had
invented
covered
every
inch
with
this
stuff
fitting
them
neatly
smoothly
and
evenly
together
all
sorts
of
designs
he
made
the
mexican
coat
of
arms
serpents
birds
animals
scenes
from
life
eve
plucking
an
apple
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
handing
it
to
adam
the
work
was
done
so
well
that
it
now
looks
like
the
finest
mosaic
and
hence
it
is
called
the
mosaic
grotto
flowers
trees
and
vines
are
growing
inside
and
by
candle
light
it
looks
like
a
transformation
scene
there
are
potteries
located
here
where
the
indians
make
all
sorts
of
queer
little
things
which
have
some
claim
to
beauty
and
are
bought
by
the
natives
as
well
as
foreigners
there
is
some
talk
of
making
a
pleasure
resort
at
the
village
of
papotla
the
historic
noche
triste
where
cortes
when
flying
from
the
furious
aztecs
ordered
a
short
halt
and
sitting
down
under
an
old
knotted
and
gnarled
cypress
tree
wept
at
his
failure
the
tree
is
not
a
thing
of
beauty
and
has
very
little
life
remaining
in
it
now
the
top
has
been
removed
and
it
has
been
badly
burned
on
the
inside
by
some
one
who
had
no
love
for
the
memory
of
cortes
a
large
iron
fence
now
surrounds
it
and
effectually
blocks
the
destroyers
or
trophy
gatherer
hand
from
further
vandalism
a
pleasure
resort
might
do
well
here
as
the
surrounding
country
is
beautiful
between
here
and
the
city
is
the
canal
over
which
the
spanish
commander
alvavado
made
his
famous
leap
thereby
saving
his
life
stories
of
it
differ
one
says
that
a
wet
mossy
log
crossed
the
canal
and
the
spanish
seeing
this
their
only
means
of
escape
tried
to
cross
the
condition
of
the
log
caused
them
to
slip
and
they
were
drowned
in
the
depths
below
when
alvarado
came
to
it
and
saw
the
fate
of
the
others
he
stuck
his
spear
or
halberd
into
the
center
and
safely
sprung
over
still
others
claim
he
made
the
leap
without
the
aid
of
an
intervening
log
another
pretty
story
has
been
exploded
in
the
botanical
garden
at
the
palace
they
have
the
celebrated
flower
of
the
aztecs
the
story
runs
that
there
are
only
three
of
the
kind
in
the
world
one
one
at
the
palace
another
at
a
different
point
in
mexico
and
the
mother
plant
on
the
mountain
at
one
time
two
tribes
had
a
long
and
bloody
war
for
the
possession
of
it
so
the
story
goes
but
with
a
great
deal
more
exaggeration
the
plant
is
commonly
called
the
as
they
claim
that
inside
is
a
perfect
baby
hand
i
went
to
see
it
and
was
much
disappointed
the
tree
grows
to
a
good
height
the
leaves
are
thick
and
about
the
color
of
the
under
part
of
a
leaf
except
that
they
are
very
rough
which
prevents
them
from
glistening
like
the
maple
the
thick
red
blossom
grows
mouth
upward
and
inside
is
the
hand
it
has
five
fingers
and
one
thumb
but
looks
exactly
like
a
bird
claw
and
not
like
a
hand
the
story
ran
that
there
are
but
three
in
existence
without
doubt
the
plant
is
rare
and
there
may
be
no
more
than
a
dozen
if
that
many
in
the
world
but
i
have
seen
in
the
gardens
of
two
different
gentlemen
the
very
same
tree
one
of
these
gentlemen
is
in
europe
and
the
other
bought
his
plant
from
him
so
there
was
no
way
of
learning
where
the
tree
came
from
mexican
houses
are
built
to
last
centuries
it
is
a
common
thing
to
see
houses
two
hundred
years
old
and
they
are
better
than
many
they
are
putting
up
for
they
are
adopting
the
american
style
of
building
in
as
small
a
space
as
possible
the
structures
to
stand
for
a
few
years
the
house
where
humboldt
lived
is
near
the
center
of
the
city
it
is
not
kept
as
a
monument
to
his
memory
as
one
would
suppose
when
they
think
of
the
professed
love
of
mexico
for
him
but
is
occupied
by
a
private
family
the
only
thing
that
marks
the
house
from
those
surrounding
it
is
a
small
plate
above
the
door
on
which
is
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
alexander
humboldt
who
lived
in
this
house
in
the
year
in
the
centennial
anniversary
of
his
birth
the
german
residenters
september
at
tacubaya
two
miles
from
the
city
there
is
a
large
tree
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
feet
in
height
it
is
green
winter
and
summer
and
was
never
known
to
shed
its
leaves
which
are
of
a
peculiar
oblong
shape
and
a
beautiful
livid
green
for
the
reason
that
it
never
sheds
its
leaves
it
derived
the
name
of
the
blessed
tree
the
large
fountain
at
the
foot
which
furnishes
the
water
for
the
poor
of
the
village
is
called
the
fountain
of
the
blessed
tree
and
the
pulque
shop
and
grocery
store
opposite
are
named
the
pulque
shop
and
the
beautiful
store
of
the
blessed
tree
mexico
is
the
hotbed
of
children
the
land
is
flooded
with
them
and
a
small
family
is
a
thing
unknown
they
greet
you
at
every
window
at
every
corner
on
every
woman
back
they
fill
the
carriages
and
the
plaza
they
are
like
a
swarm
of
bees
around
a
honeysuckle
one
on
every
tiny
flower
and
hundreds
waiting
for
their
chance
a
man
died
the
other
day
who
was
followed
to
the
grave
by
sons
and
daughters
and
had
buried
thirteen
more
than
you
can
count
in
three
generations
in
the
states
so
he
was
a
father
to
the
grand
total
of
one
hundred
children
there
is
another
man
living
in
mexico
who
has
had
two
wives
and
who
has
living
children
down
in
a
small
village
out
from
vera
cruz
is
a
father
with
children
allowing
the
small
average
of
five

can
see
how
numerous
the
grandchildren
would
be

acquainted

mother

half
years
older

he

she
has
eighteen
more

is
a
blessed
thing
that
the

to
live
in
a
cane
hut

exist
on
beans

something
dreadful
chapter
xix
a
day
trip
on
a
street
car
after
being
annoyed
by
the
porter
for
two
hours
who
feared
we
would
miss
the
train
our
party
of
two
at
four
in
the
morning
started
for
jalapa
even
at
this
unholy
hour
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
at
the
station
where
they
busied
themselves
packing
their
luggage
aboard
every
woman
had
one
male
escort
some
several
the
mexicans
surveyed
myself
and
my
chaperone
in
amazement
but
i
defied
their
gaze
and
showed
them
that
a
free
american
girl
can
accommodate
herself
to
circumstances
without
the
aid
of
a
man
the
mozo
who
had
carried
the
bothersome
sachel
demanded
un
peso
one
dollar
which
i
very
promptly
refused
and
gave
him
the
smallest
change
from
my
purse
cents
the
seats
run
lengthwise
like
in
an
ordinary
street
car
and
a
frenchman
sitting
opposite
who
witnessed
our
little
transaction
and
my
very
limited
knowledge
of
spanish
remarked
well
mademoiselle
you
are
smarter
than
i
a
man
charged
me
one
dollar
and
a
half
just
for
the
same
service
that
one
rendered
you
and
although
i
speak
spanish
i
had
to
pay
it
the
occupants
of
the
car
were
the
frenchman
and
his
wife
a
musician
wife
and
a
mexican
and
frenchman
solitaire
as
they
say
here
and
ourselves
it
was
far
from
daylight
so
making
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
they
all
went
to
sleep
the
mexican
women
were
dressed
in
plain
black
with
black
veils
and
very
high
hats
they
carried
little
black
hand
sachels
wore
no
gloves
and
their
fingernails
easily
a
longer
than
the
finger
were
cut
in
the
shape
then
so
fashionable
the
frenchwoman
did
not
look
very
pretty
as
she
slept
with
her
mouth
open
she
was
dressed
in
red
silk
with
red
hat
and
veil
yellow
gloves
and
linen
duster
she
was
very
fleshy
and
had
besides
a
hand
sachel
a
cage
in
which
were
two
brown
birds
dotted
with
red
which
they
informed
us
later
were
french
canaries
her
husband
was
about
six
feet
three
inches
and
weighed
undoubtedly
three
hundred
pounds
the
solitaire
frenchman
was
and
had
white
which
stood
out
at
right
angles
to
the
length
of
one
foot
his
whiskers
were
the
largest
part
of
him
the
mexican
had
a
very
red
nose
extremely
thick
lips
and
was
rather
the
married
mexican
looked
exactly
like
a
jolly
something
very
extraordinary
after
i
had
finished
this
inspection
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
which
hung
in
the
center
of
the
car
i
too
went
to
sleep
and
knew
no
more
till
the
train
stopped
at
the
journey
end
a
few
miles
out
from
vera
cruz
it
ended
the
train
journey
but
not
ours
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
is
made
by
tramway
the
cars
are
very
high
have
four
seats
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
excluded
by
a
tin
roof
and
canvas
sides
six
mules
do
the
hauling
and
two
cars
first
and
are
run
each
way
daily
they
run
on
a
regular
iron
track
as
it
was
once
the
intention
to
run
steam
cars
here
a
great
deal
of
freight
is
hauled
in
this
manner
the
village
surrounding
this
station
is
entirely
composed
of
straw
huts
we
were
soon
seated
in
the
tram
car
our
number
increased
by
the
guardsmen
who
as
the
old
saying
goes
were
armed
to
the
teeth
a
bell
rang
and
off
we
started
with
a
rush
the
car
keeping
close
to
us
our
happiness
would
have
been
supreme
had
not
the
driver
lashed
his
mules
continually
the
scenery
was
fine
the
tall
graceful
palms
the
cocoa
trees
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
beautiful
orchids
and
wild
flowers
the
birds
some
piping
heavenly
strains
others
taking
their
morning
bath
in
the
running
stream
which
crept
along
the
wayside
with
a
dreamy
murmur
the
delightfully
fragrant
balmy
air
everything
seemed
to
lend
its
aid
to
make
the
scene
one
of
indescribable
loveliness
it
was
interesting
to
note
the
homes
and
home
life
of
the
natives
in
this
rural
spot
their
straw
houses
are
built
simply
by
setting
trees
for
corner
posts
and
sticking
the
cane
into
the
ground
around
them
the
roof
of
cane
grass
or
palm
leaves
always
runs
up
to
a
high
peak
generally
every
house
has
a
porch
and
more
rooms
than
one
but
never
any
other
floor
than
the
ground
sometimes
they
exhibit
good
taste
in
building
and
one
house
will
have
several
rooms
two
or
more
porches
and
pretty
peaks
and
curves
which
one
would
think
impossible
to
make
of
cane
the
furniture
does
not
cost
much
it
consists
entirely
of
petates
they
furnish
the
tables
the
beds
the
chairs
and
suspended
by
a
rope
make
a
comfortable
swinging
cradle
for
the
babies
this
useful
piece
of
furniture
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
mat
woven
by
themselves
in
plain
or
colored
straw
these
people
no
difference
how
poor
own
burros
dogs
chickens
pigs
and
other
domestic
animals
which
do
not
occupy
outside
or
separate
houses
but
live
sleep
and
eat
right
in
among
them
a
pig
is
as
much
at
home
in
the
kitchen
or
parlor
as
in
a
mud
puddle
it
is
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
sleeping
children
bound
on
one
side
by
a
pig
on
the
other
by
a
sheep
and
at
their
feet
either
a
dog
or
a
goat
dinner
was
secured
at
an
inn
situated
midway
on
the
line
the
landlord
taxed
each
passenger
one
dollar
for
the
frugal
repast
and
even
then
did
not
seem
satisfied
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
beating
fiercely
down
when
the
travelers
again
boarded
the
tram
car
one
woman
took
from
her
sachel
a
cross
and
prayer
book
and
read
herself
to
sleep
the
other
mexican
girl
leaned
her
head
on
the
back
of
the
seat
and
went
to
sleep
the
big
frenchwoman
turned
her
back
to
the
side
of
the
car
and
putting
her
knees
up
on
the
seat
she
too
went
to
sleep
her
husband
by
this
time
was
nodding
slowly
and
soothingly
while
the
other
frenchman
was
trying
to
tickle
him
by
running
a
straw
down
his
back
but
at
length
he
tired
of
efforts
unrewarded
and
sat
down
and
went
to
sleep
when
i
looked
at
the
two
mexicans
they
were
asleep
one
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
the
driver
had
tied
the
lines
around
the
brake
lock
and
was
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
nod
even
the
two
holders
of
defensive
weapons
who
were
there
to
guard
us
from
all
sorts
of
imaginary
evils
were
so
sound
asleep
that
a
cannon
shot
would
not
wake
them
even
the
little
birds
had
tucked
their
heads
carefully
under
their
wings
and
maybe
were
dreaming
it
was
all
so
comical
that
i
glanced
at
my
little
mother
to
find
she
was
bravely
trying
to
resist
the
sleepy
god
she
gave
me
a
drowsy
sympathetic
smile
while
i
buried
my
face
in
my
light
shawl
and
laughed
just
like
i
used
to
do
in
church
when
i
would
see
anything
funny
and
my
laughter
was
just
as
hearty
and
hard
to
control
the
mules
had
long
ago
gone
to
sleep
but
still
managed
to
move
slightly
the
situation
was
too
overpowering
and
i
must
confess
that
after
putting
myself
into
as
small
a
knot
as
possible
i
deposited
my
entire
body
on
the
seat
and
soon
went
sound
asleep
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
found
all
the
rest
awake
and
the
married
mexican
preparing
to
shoot
birds
the
driver
was
certainly
the
most
obliging
fellow
in
the
world
when
anything
was
shot
he
stopped
the
car
and
waited
until
the
other
got
off
and
procured
his
game
the
mexican
shot
at
everything
which
was
living
except
the
trees
and
flowers
but
he
got
off
for
nothing
but
squirrels
and
the
heartlessness
of
it
made
us
wish
they
had
a
humane
society
here
for
many
of
the
poor
birds
were
disabled
and
the
thought
that
they
must
live
on
in
pain
for
many
days
was
not
a
pleasant
one
our
route
lay
over
the
old
diligence
road
that
connected
mexico
with
the
end
of
the
world
cortes
the
french
and
the
americans
all
traveled
over
it
we
crossed
the
old
national
bridge
and
saw
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
forts
built
by
cortes
when
the
mexican
tired
of
his
killing
sport
the
three
ladies
joined
him
in
a
game
of
cards
which
the
passengers
and
driver
watched
with
absorbing
interest
while
the
mules
resumed
their
nap
i
was
bored
beyond
endurance
by
the
listlessness
of
the
company
and
was
not
sorry
when
their
attention
was
attracted
by
a
cart
drawn
by
four
oxen
which
was
descending
a
high
hill
in
the
distance
the
cards
were
put
aside
and
they
began
to
talk
about
the
hacienda
which
was
clearly
in
view
and
the
beautiful
mansion
cathedral
and
numerous
homes
for
the
laborers
which
held
a
commanding
position
on
top
of
the
same
high
hill
down
which
the
cart
was
coming
when
we
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
by
looking
back
we
could
see
a
white
streak
which
separated
sky
and
earth
and
were
told
it
was
the
sea
at
vera
cruz
sixty
miles
away
the
cart
stopped
at
this
point
where
the
motive
power
was
renewed
by
fresh
mules
and
its
passengers
three
women
kissed
and
hugged
the
trio
of
mexicans
in
our
party
the
hacienda
owned
by
our
fellow
travelers
once
belonged
to
santa
anna
when
we
resumed
the
journey
it
was
drawing
on
toward
evening
and
i
began
to
view
the
beautiful
surroundings
with
but
a
lazy
interest
the
queer
fences
built
of
mud
and
topped
with
cactus
plant
and
hedges
formed
of
beautiful
palms
fifty
or
one
hundred
years
old
commanded
but
a
passing
glance
pretty
little
homes
lovely
gardens
and
sugar
factories
had
ceased
to
be
of
interest
so
we
settled
down
to
rest
until
the
frenchman
stretched
out
his
arm
and
ejaculated
jalapa
in
a
moment
all
weariness
vanished
and
we
were
fresh
as
in
the
morning
i
wish
i
could
show
you
jalapa
just
as
i
saw
it
then
it
nestled
down
in
the
valley
like
a
kitten
in
a
cushioned
basket
the
white
houses
gleamed
like
silver
through
the
green
trees
while
the
surrounding
mountains
were
enveloped
in
a
light
bluish
mist
which
grew
black
as
the
distance
increased
the
sun
had
just
slipped
behind
one
leaving
its
golden
trail
the
black
and
white
clouds
the
misty
mountains
all
mixed
in
one
harmonious
mass
we
entered
the
town
with
a
rush
the
driver
blowing
his
tin
horn
to
warn
the
inhabitants
of
our
arrival
a
large
crowd
had
collected
at
the
station
but
only
two
hotel
runners
were
there
to
bother
us
and
as
all
the
other
passengers
were
citizens
they
clung
to
us
faithfully
the
frenchman
said
he
would
go
with
us
to
the
hotel
and
make
all
arrangements
he
took
us
to
what
he
thought
was
the
best
and
asked
the
woman
the
price
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
a
day
she
said
and
us
we
were
satisfied
he
bade
us
and
left
us
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
mexicans
the
hotel
was
certainly
very
clean
and
nice
in
the
courtyard
were
trees
and
flowers
a
porch
paved
with
brick
tile
surrounded
this
and
was
hung
at
every
available
space
with
bird
cages
the
building
only
was
painted
white
with
trimmings
of
blue
the
overhanging
roof
was
down
low
and
the
rafters
which
are
never
hidden
were
painted
a
light
blue
the
supper
was
undoubtedly
the
best
we
had
eaten
in
mexico
and
it
immediately
put
a
warm
place
in
our
heart
for
the
little
superintendent
who
lived
awhile
in
the
states
and
there
learned
to
cook
jalapa
is
at
present
the
capital
of
the
state
of
vera
cruz
the
capital
business
is
very
different
here
from
what
it
is
in
the
states
there
once
a
capital
always
a
capital
here
every
new
governor
locates
the
capital
where
it
best
suits
his
convenience
if
that
should
be
in
the
forest
orizaba
and
vera
cruz
have
both
served
repeated
terms
but
jalapa
made
a
successful
run
and
got
in
at
the
last
convention
it
is
a
very
old
town
and
not
only
noted
for
the
beauty
of
its
women
who
possess
light
hair
and
eyes
and
beautiful
complexions
but
for
the
beauty
of
its
location
it
is
known
as
the
flower
garden
of
mexico
and
the
old
familiar
saying
was
see
jalapa
and
die
as
it
was
supposed
to
contain
everything
worth
seeing
but
at
present
it
is
simply
a
beautiful
sleepy
paradise
reminding
one
of
a
pretty
child
in
death
quiet
and
still
almost
buried
in
a
wealth
of
flowers
the
government
buildings
and
churches
are
very
fine
but
the
houses
are
only
one
story
they
are
built
with
low
overhanging
roofs
and
are
tastily
painted
some
pink
houses
have
overhangers
and
versa
while
white
houses
have
blue
or
pink
and
the
yellow
have
blue
pink
and
white
trimmings
every
street
is
very
irregular
narrow
in
some
places
wide
in
others
and
as
crooked
as
the
path
of
a
sinner
one
can
walk
for
a
day
and
imagine
they
are
on
the
same
street
all
the
time
or
on
a
different
one
every
thirty
feet
just
as
fancy
dictates
one
would
willingly
spend
a
lifetime
on
this
spot
of
earth
let
down
from
heaven
as
the
mexicans
speak
of
it
away
over
hills
and
ravines
can
be
seen
the
great
cofre
de
perote
thirteen
thousand
five
hundred
and
feet
high
a
great
mass
of
white
porphyry
in
the
shape
of
a
chest
gleams
from
its
dark
side
from
this
it
derived
its
name
cofre
still
above
all
as
though
endeavoring
to
reach
heaven
is
the
snowy
peak
of
orizaba
the
former
is
within
a
day
travel
from
the
town
and
well
deserves
a
visit
to
the
northeast
thirty
miles
distant
is
the
lovely
village
of
misantla
noted
for
its
beautiful
scenery
and
aztec
temple
and
pyramid
a
little
further
north
is
another
pyramid
the
finest
and
oldest
in
mexico
jilatepec
is
only
seven
miles
away
it
is
a
lovely
indian
village
peculiarly
situated
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
valley
several
foreign
families
are
located
at
the
flower
town
of
cuatepec
owners
of
some
of
its
coffee
plantations
jalapa
has
a
population
of
and
an
elevation
of
feet
the
climate
is
cool
the
soil
fertile
and
the
town
never
visited
by
contagious
diseases
all
around
are
plantations
of
coffee
tobacco
vanilla
cotton
maize
and
jalapa
the
old
medicine
which
was
a
remedy
for
every
known
ill
to
which
flesh
is
heir
to
jalapa
is
pronounced
as
though
it
were
spelled
with
an
with
a
soft
sound
to
the
halapah
there
are
many
cotton
mills
around
the
suburbs
that
are
well
worth
the
time
it
takes
to
visit
them
we
visited
one
owned
by
our
polite
french
friend
the
building
once
sheltered
nuns
and
the
garden
which
surrounds
it
shows
what
it
might
once
have
been
but
is
now
one
tangled
mass
of
climbing
roses
lemon
orange
and
coffee
trees
and
numerous
flowers
for
which
i
know
no
name
at
the
back
from
a
little
stone
turret
one
can
view
a
smooth
green
plain
divided
by
a
silvery
stream
known
by
the
inappropriate
name
of
the
dry
river
while
it
was
never
known
to
go
dry
which
flows
on
to
make
that
ponderous
machinery
its
slave
as
it
turns
around
with
almost
diabolical
glee
men
and
women
do
the
work
they
receive
from
one
real
to
cents
a
day
the
machinery
all
comes
from
england
not
far
from
the
main
cathedral
are
the
ruins
of
the
convent
of
san
francisco

is
easily
three
hundred
years
old
and
is
of
immense
size
over
the
door
of
the
chapel
part
we
could
trace
property
of
king
philip
of
spain
while
cut
in
gilt
letters
on
a
black
plate
just
a
little
nearer
the
edge
of
the
building
is
the
inscription
land
of
benito
juarez
the
baths
are
now
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
costing
only
six
cents
the
open
swimming
baths
are
used
for
horses
and
dogs
the
former
costing
three
cents
the
latter
gratis
providing
the
canine
accompanies
the
horse
the
public
laundry
is
another
place
of
interest
it
is
situated
in
the
center
of
the
town
built
of
brick
with
stationary
porous
stones
for
washboards
the
city
charges
nothing
for
the
use
of
the
place
when
evening
came
i
called
my
old
landlady
up
and
offered
her
three
dollars
for
the
day
no
she
said
i
want
six
dollars
i
was
astonished
but
managed
with
a
mixture
of
english
and
spanish
to
tell
her
i
would
pay
no
more
she
went
to
her
husband
and
he
made
out
a
bill
payable
by
nellie
bly
for
two
supper
all
night
coffee
and
breakfast
six
dollars
i
told
her
it
was
all
wrong
and
added
that
she
was
bad
because
i
did
not
know
a
spanish
word
for
cheat
but
i
wanted
to
get
as
near
it
as
possible
at
last
i
tried
to
drive
some
sense
into
her
head
and
explained
that
the
bill
for
one
day
for
two
was
three
dollars
si
hay
pronounced
see
eye
she
asserted
well
i
came
last
night
was
here
till
this
afternoon
one
day
eh
no
two
was
her
astonishing
reply
well
madame
hours
is
one
day
in
the
united
states
and
if
it
is
so
here
i
will
start
it
now
i
gave
her
three
dollars
and
remembering
the
old
adage
that
he
who
fights
and
runs
away
lives
to
fight
another
day
and
having
no
desire
to
leave
my
bones
in
jalapa
or
go
to
vera
cruz
with
a
map
drawn
on
my
face
with
her
fingernails
returned
to
my
room
and
left
her
to
vent
her
rage
on
her
husband
or
servants
as
she
wished
but
she
was
not
going
to
be
beaten
by
a
gringo
so
she
sent
for
the
frenchman
who
brought
me
there
he
rapped
on
my
door
and
asked
what
was
wrong
i
told
him
the
old
lady
was
not
only
seeing
double
but
counted
everything
by
the
second
multiplication
table
he
laughed
and
said
she
thought
i
was
a
gringo
and
she
could
cheat
me
he
soon
made
her
see
clearer
and
we
remained
the
following
night
and
had
supper
for
cents
i
had
learned
pretty
well
how
to
make
all
arrangements
first
and
proposed
in
the
future
not
to
drink
a
glass
of
water
until
i
knew
the
price
i
had
no
intention
of
allowing
a
yankee
girl
to
be
cheated
by
a
mexican
man
or
woman
the
next
morning
we
started
on
our
return
trip
to
vera
cruz
we
looked
forward
to
it
with
pleasure
as
the
former
day
spent
on
a
street
car
was
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
unique
experiences
of
my
life
we
had
very
few
passengers
down
the
conductor
two
soldiers
driver
one
old
woman
and
ourselves
and
a
game
rooster
who
crowed
at
every
village
and
was
treated
with
as
much
consideration
as
a
babe
would
have
been
at
the
station
just
before
we
started
an
old
man
who
had
heard
us
speaking
english
came
up
and
spoke
to
us
he
was
an
american
but
having
lived
in
this
town
for
forty
years
had
forgotten
his
mother
tongue
his
english
was
about
as
good
as
the
newsboy
who
took
me
to
his
hotel
in
vera
cruz
the
old
woman
was
going
about
one
hundred
and
miles
to
see
her
married
daughter
and
she
was
this
woman
did
not
know
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
united
states
could
not
imagine
what
new
york
meant
and
had
never
heard
of
george
washington
not
to
mention
the
little
hatchet
and
the
democratic
cry
of
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
again
she
made
the
trip
alternately
smoking
a
cigarette
and
reading
her
a
short
way
out
on
the
road
the
driver
got
off
and
picked
up
a
little
gray
bird
by
the
roadside
on
examination
i
found
its
side
was
terribly
lacerated
by
a
shot
but
i
bound
it
up
with
my
silk
handkerchief
and
decided
to
carry
it
to
vera
cruz
where
i
would
try
my
hand
at
surgery
the
day
passed
similar
to
the
former
one
everybody
going
to
sleep
after
dinner
but
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
the
novelty
of
a
day
in
a
street
car
robbed
it
of
all
disagreeable
features
and
as
we
neared
vera
cruz
i
not
only
noted
this
the
spiciest
experience
of
my
life
but
said
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
any
other
in
the
republic
of
mexico
chapter
xx
where
maximilian
american
colony
lived
on
opening
my
door
one
morning
to
leave
for
the
railway
station
a
man
who
had
evidently
been
waiting
by
the
side
of
the
entrance
sprung
forward
and
seized
my
baggage
my
first
impression
was
that
he
was
a
robber
but
i
retained
my
screams
for
another
occasion
and
decided
it
was
a
mozo
who
wanted
to
help
me
to
the
train
remembering
former
experience
and
wishing
to
profit
thereby
i
rushed
after
and
caught
him
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
clutching
his
blouse
with
a
death
grip
i
yelled
cuanto
un
peso
he
answered
well
as
i
was
a
healthy
american
girl
and
as
strong
as
one
can
be
after
several
months
training
on
beans
and
cayenne
pepper
i
had
no
intention
of
giving
a
great
big
brown
fellow
for
carrying
a
sachel
half
a
square
i
said
no
in
a
pretty
forcible
manner
and
gave
weight
and
meaning
to
my
monosyllable
by
jerking
the
sachel
away
he
looked
at
me
in
amazement
and
as
he
saw
i
was
not
going
to
be
cheated
he
said
fifty
cents
i
said
nothing
and
picking
up
the
sachel
trudged
at
the
door
he
once
more
approached
me
and
asked
how
much
i
would
give
un
medio
six
and
a
quarter
cents
i
replied
bueno
he
said
and
took
it
at
the
price
while
i
congratulated
myself
on
saving
and
cents
the
car
was
full
of
people
who
we
found
out
afterward
composed
a
spanish
opera
troupe
although
they
were
not
many
they
filled
the
car
and
in
order
to
get
a
seat
we
had
to
put
down
shawls
beer
and
a
pet
dog
a
green
parrot
and
numerous
small
things
every
woman
had
at
least
three
children
which
were
cared
for
by
as
many
nurses
oh
what
a
howling
dirty
lazy
mob
the
pretty
little
town
of
cordoba
lies
about
two
miles
from
the
station
and
street
cars
hauled
by
four
mules
await
each
train
and
carry
the
passengers
to
the
village
twelve
and
a
half
cents
the
cars
wind
through
little
streets
shaded
on
either
side
by
beautiful
foliage
which
every
here
and
there
gives
the
tourist
tantalizing
glimpses
of
the
exquisite
tropical
gardens
within
the
street
car
passes
the
only
hotel
in
the
town
the
diligencia
it
is
a
low
structure
and
looks
more
like
a
than
a
habitation
for
human
beings
the
overhanging
roof
droops
toward
the
pavement
and
is
within
a
few
feet
of
the
ground
inside
one
sees
a
little
porch
on
one
side
which
covered
with
many
trailing
curling
vines
serves
for
the
opposite
is
an
office
and
bedroom
combined
where
at
the
desk
sits
a
man
writing
ever
writing
from
morning
until
night
shade
hides
the
tracing
from
his
aged
eyes
he
greets
one
with
a
weary
pathetic
smile
and
a
look
in
his
saddened
eyes
as
though
wondering
what
has
become
of
all
the
guests
who
used
to
trip
in
gayly
with
black
eyes
and
white
teeth
sparkling
in
evident
pleasure
at
reaching
his
hospitable
board
with
whom
he
grasped
hand
and
in
true
mexican
style
said
my
house
is
yours
and
that
friend
responded
your
humble
servant
poor
old
landlord
he
has
lived
too
long
the
advent
of
civilization
has
rushed
in
upon
his
friends
and
crushed
out
his
trade
the
noisy
old
diligencia
has
long
ceased
to
rattle
except
in
his
memory
and
the
modern
stops
at
his
door
once
in
many
months
to
leave
him
a
curious
stranger
whom
he
greets
with
that
strange
smile
and
then
returns
to
his
writing
waiting
for
that
which
is
nevermore
a
man
and
woman
came
in
on
the
same
train
and
the
latter
offered
her
services
to
us
being
able
to
speak
the
two
languages
when
we
entered
the
chambermaid
took
my
troublesome
baggage
and
led
us
back
to
where
the
rooms
formed
a
circle
around
the
court
in
the
center
stood
a
large
basin
where
several
old
horses
and
mules
which
looked
like
old
rip
after
his
long
sleep
were
lazily
drinking
they
paused
long
enough
to
survey
the
unusual
arrival
when
we
entered
our
room
the
chambermaid
who
is
always
of
the
male
gender
in
mexico
set
down
my
baggage
and
demanded
fifty
cents
i
not
feeling
disposed
to
throw
money
away
decided
not
to
pay
one
cent
accordingly
i
laid
aside
my
few
words
of
spanish
and
spoke
to
him
in
english
what
do
you
want
i
do
understand
etc
at
last
he
took
two
quarters
from
his
pockets
and
held
them
before
me
on
his
open
palm
i
calmly
reached
out
and
taking
them
was
going
to
transfer
them
to
my
pocket
when
he
in
great
alarm
yelled
no
no
and
grabbing
them
tied
them
up
in
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
with
great
haste
and
evident
pleasure
it
had
the
effect
of
curing
him
for
he
immediately
shook
hands
and
left
without
demanding
more
cordoba
or
cordora
was
established
april
with
inhabitants
it
was
during
the
time
of
the
viceroy
diego
fernandez
de
cordoba
marquis
of
guadalcazar
and
was
named
for
him
king
philip
iii
of
spain
issued
the
charter
on
november
of
the
same
year
the
population
composed
of
mexicans
germans
and
american
is
it
is
built
compactly
the
town
is
clean
and
healthful
nearly
all
the
streets
are
paved
but
everything
has
a
quiet
appearance
there
are
no
public
works
but
the
surrounding
plantations
which
mark
it
as
one
of
the
prettiest
places
in
mexico
furnish
work
for
the
populace
the
indians
are
cleaner
and
better
looking
than
those
around
the
city
of
mexico
and
children
are
not
so
plentiful
but
one
pulque
shop
is
running
consequently
there
are
less
drunken
people
than
elsewhere
yet
the
jail
is
full
of
prisoners
on
sunday
people
are
permitted
to
visit
their
friends
in
jail
they
can
not
go
in
but
they
can
go
as
far
as
the
bars
and
look
through
the
prisoners
are
herded
like
so
many
cattle
their
friends
carry
them
food
they
push
a
small
basket
through
the
bars
and
the
intervening
officer
puts
it
through
another
set
of
bars
into
the
hands
of
the
fortunate
receiver
sometimes
the
prisoners
get
a
few
pence
and
are
enabled
to
buy
what
they
want
from
the
venders
who
come
there
to
sell
indeed
it
is
ofttimes
difficult
to
say
which
mob
looks
the
worse
the
one
on
the
inside
or
the
visitors
the
market
at
present
is
situated
on
the
ground
around
the
plaza
but
some
spanish
gentleman
is
building
what
will
be
one
of
the
handsomest
market
houses
in
mexico
it
is
situated
on
the
edge
of
town
and
the
surroundings
are
most
pleasing
on
one
side
is
the
ruins
of
an
old
convent
famous
for
the
goodness
of
the
sisters
their
exquisite
needlework
their
intelligence
and
beauty
but
time
has
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
the
structure
and
it
has
fallen
into
decay
at
the
back
stands
a
high
marble
shaft
broken
at
the
top
and
dotted
with
green
cacti
which
have
sprung
forth
from
the
little
crevices
it
has
the
appearance
of
very
old
age
but
was
erected
in
honor
of
those
who
fell
in
the
fight
for
liberty
one
of
the
finest
gardens
in
mexico
bounds
the
other
side
it
is
the
property
of
the
gentleman
who
gave
the
ground
and
is
building
the
market
house
which
alone
will
cost
it
is
a
marvel
of
beautiful
walks
and
cunning
retreats
it
seems
absurd
that
such
a
spot
so
fitted
for
should
be
placed
in
a
country
where
they
do
know
how
to
make
use
of
it
in
the
center
stands
a
swiss
cottage
built
of
cane
with
a
window
a
stairway
also
of
cane
leads
to
the
second
story
and
little
balconies
surrounding
the
colored
windows
give
one
a
lovely
view
of
the
entire
valley
and
surrounding
hills
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
give
some
idea
of
the
bountiful
flowers
which
are
forever
opening
up
their
pretty
perfumed
faces
in
this
entrancing
spot
there
are
thousands
of
roses
of
all
colors
and
shades
from
the
size
of
a
gold
dollar
to
that
of
the
fashionable
female
hat
one
spot
shows
tiny
flowers
fit
for
the
fairies
of
wonderful
shade
and
mold
next
would
be
a
large
healthy
rugged
tree
which
bore
flowers
as
delicate
and
dainty
as
any
plant
in
existence
it
reminded
one
of
a
strong
father
with
his
tiny
babe
in
his
protecting
arms
the
handsome
avenues
are
perfect
bowers
of
beauty
the
little
birds
in
the
foliage
twitter
softly
but
incessantly
it
is
all
life
but
in
a
subdued
gentle
monotone
soft
as
the
last
lullaby
over
the
little
child
who
has
closed
its
eyes
and
with
a
smile
joined
that
heavenly
band
to
which
it
rightly
belongs
this
is
the
only
place
in
mexico
where
we
found
a
man
who
knew
enough
to
have
the
flowers
separated
by
a
green
lawn
it
is
the
universal
rule
here
to
grow
anything
but
grass
which
is
considered
an
unsightly
weed
a
spanish
gentleman
once
took
me
to
see
the
grounds
surrounding
a
mexican
mansion
the
trees
flowers
and
shrubs
as
well
as
the
statuary
and
fountains
could
not
be
excelled
but
the
ground
was
bare
as
mother
hubbard
cupboard
and
swept
as
clean
as
a
dancing
floor
this
place
cost
more
than
five
million
dollars
and
thousands
more
yearly
explained
the
gentleman
you
have
nothing
in
the
states
to
compare
with
it
cordoba
supports
three
public
schools
and
male
and
female
academies
one
theater
and
about
thirty
churches
the
finest
church
located
next
to
the
plaza
cost
thousands
of
dollars
it
has
a
marble
floor
and
twenty
altars
dressed
in
the
finest
lace
with
silver
and
gold
ornaments
the
frescoing
displays
exquisite
workmanship
the
images
are
and
quaint
the
plantations
surrounding
cordoba
grow
oranges
pineapples
coffee
bananas
tobacco
rice
cocoanuts
and
peanuts
coffee
was
introduced
into
the
west
indies
in
and
here
in
it
grows
best
in
a
temperate
zone
and
vera
cruz
raises
more
than
any
other
state
in
mexico
most
every
variety
requires
protection
from
the
sun
and
will
die
if
set
out
alone
so
those
having
large
groves
plant
coffee
in
them
others
make
double
use
of
their
fertile
land
by
planting
groves
of
cocoa
palms
with
the
alternate
rows
of
coffee
trees
the
leaf
and
bark
of
a
coffee
tree
resemble
that
of
a
black
cherry
the
blossom
is
white
and
with
a
faint
perfume
and
the
berries
grow
on
a
branch
like
gooseberries
a
tree
will
bear
three
years
after
planting
the
seed
and
on
one
branch
will
have
ripe
and
green
coffee
and
blossoms
all
at
the
same
time
when
ripe
it
is
gathered
and
laid
on
the
ground
to
dry
being
stirred
every
morning
to
dry
it
equally
this
whips
the
hull
off
and
it
is
taken
to
the
village
where
it
sells
for
four
cents
a
pound
each
hull
holds
two
grains
one
tree
will
live
and
bear
with
little
or
no
cultivation
for
eighty
years
bananas
are
four
years
old
before
they
bear
the
finer
banana
is
never
seen
in
the
states
as
it
will
not
bear
shipping
the
kind
shipped
there
the
people
here
consider
unfit
to
eat
unless
cooked
and
they
prepare
some
very
dainty
dishes
from
them
there
are
more
than
fifty
different
varieties
from
three
inches
in
length
to
of
a
yard
the
small
ones
are
the
best
the
leaves
are
used
by
the
merchants
for
and
by
the
indians
for
thousands
of
different
things
tobacco
now
grows
in
about
half
the
states
of
the
republic
and
thrives
up
to
an
elevation
of
six
thousand
feet
formerly
its
cultivation
was
restricted
to
orizaba
and
cordoba
and
a
leaf
of
it
found
growing
elsewhere
either
accidentally
or
for
private
consumption
was
by
law
promptly
uprooted
by
officials
appointed
to
watch
for
it
in
two
million
pounds
of
it
grew
in
this
district
but
now
the
output
is
greatly
decreased
owing
to
the
heavy
taxes
sugar
cane
grows
in
all
but
six
states
up
to
an
elevation
of
six
thousand
feet
it
requires
eighteen
months
for
crops
to
mature
except
in
warmer
soil
when
it
takes
from
eight
to
ten
months
one
remarkable
thing
is
that
the
men
who
own
the
fine
gardens
surrounding
the
village
do
not
live
near
them
as
one
would
suppose
but
inhabit
stuffy
little
houses
in
the
midst
of
the
town
one
bachelor
has
on
his
plantation
plants
from
all
parts
of
the
world
over
which
he
has
traveled
ten
times
he
cultivates
all
kinds
of
palms
in
existence
among
which
we
noticed
what
is
known
as
the
traveler
tree
it
is
a
strange
looking
thing
with
long
flat
thick
leaves
growing
up
as
though
planted
in
the
center
and
hanging
loose
at
the
ends
the
flower
is
beautiful
with
three
long
petals
the
upper
two
white
and
the
under
one
a
sky
blue
it
is
of
a
stiffness
readers
of
books
of
travel
will
be
familiar
with
the
tree
it
derives
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
grows
in
the
desert
where
no
water
is
to
be
found
on
thrusting
a
penknife
into
its
body
a
clear
stream
of
water
probably
a
pint
and
a
half
will
flow
from
one
cut
and
people
traveling
through
the
desert
quench
their
thirst
from
this
source
hence
its
name
the
water
is
very
cool
and
has
a
slight
mineral
taste
but
is
rather
good
and
pleasing
it
gives
water
freely
all
day
but
after
the
sun
sets
is
perfectly
dry
the
bread
and
quinine
trees
are
among
his
interesting
collection
one
odd
plant
attracted
attention
it
bore
a
round
green
leaf
but
wherever
there
is
to
be
a
blossom
the
four
leaves
turn
a
pretty
red
and
form
a
handsome
flower
each
leaf
forming
a
petal
the
true
blossom
which
does
not
amount
to
much
being
long
and
slim
like
a
honeysuckle
forms
the
stamens
it
is
of
foreign
importation
and
grows
in
a
climbing
vine
whole
arbors
being
covered
with
it
the
grounds
are
surrounded
by
a
hedge
of
cactus
which
is
strong
and
impassable
the
yucca
palm
and
fruit
cactus
grew
off
in
a
corner
by
themselves
several
small
streams
run
through
this
plantation
spanned
by
lovely
rustic
bridges
in
the
deep
ravines
are
found
ferns
of
every
variety
known
and
on
the
trees
a
collection
of
orchids
which
i
believe
has
no
equal
in
any
country
the
happy
owner
who
is
a
bachelor
worth
about
lives
in
a
little
house
in
the
center
of
this
town
which
has
never
been
furnished
until
last
winter
but
in
the
courtyard
he
has
plants
from
every
country
in
the
world
for
which
the
shipment
alone
cost
down
by
cordoba
i
found
a
tribe
of
indians
who
are
not
known
to
many
mexicans
excepting
those
in
their
vicinity
they
are
called
the
amatecos
and
their
village
which
lies
three
miles
from
cordoba
is
called
amatlan
their
houses
although
small
are
finer
and
handsomer
than
any
in
the
republic
flowers
fruit
and
vegetables
are
cultivated
by
them
and
all
the
pineapples
for
which
cordoba
is
famous
come
from
their
plantations
they
weave
all
their
own
clothing
and
have
their
own
priest
church
and
school
everything
is
a
model
of
cleanliness
and
throughout
the
entire
village
not
one
thing
can
be
found
out
of
place
the
women
are
about
the
medium
height
with
slim
but
shapely
bodies
their
hands
and
feet
are
very
small
and
their
faces
of
a
beautiful
grecian
shape
their
eyes
are
magnificent
and
their
hair
long
and
silky
they
dress
in
full
skirt
with
an
overdress
made
like
that
we
see
in
pictures
of
chinese
women
or
like
vestments
worn
by
priests
of
the
catholic
church
it
is
constructed
of
cotton
in
the
style
and
pattern
of
lace
around
the
neck
and
ends
it
is
beautifully
embroidered
in
colored
silk
the
dresses
always
being
white
on
the
feet
they
wear
woven
slippers
of
a
pink
color
and
on
their
heads
a
square
pink
cloth
long
enough
in
the
back
to
cover
the
neck
like
those
worn
by
peasant
girls
in
comic
operas
the
arms
are
bare
covered
alone
with
bands
and
ornaments
the
neck
is
encircled
with
beads
of
all
descriptions
and
is
also
hung
with
silver
and
gold
ornaments
the
earrings
are
very
large
hoops
like
those
introduced
into
the
states
last
fall
they
never
carry
a
baby
like
other
tribes
but
all
the
children
are
left
religiously
at
home
the
men
are
large
and
strongly
built
not
and
wear
a
very
white
blouse
and
pantaloons
which
come
down
the
distance
between
waist
and
knee
they
also
wear
many
chains
ornaments
bracelets
and
earrings
they
are
always
spotlessly
clean
and
if
they
have
a
scratch
on
their
body
of
which
they
get
many
traveling
the
thorny
roads
they
do
not
go
outside
their
village
until
entirely
healed
they
are
industrious
and
rich
and
never
leave
their
homes
but
once
a
week
where
they
bring
their
marketing
and
sell
to
the
indians
in
cordoba
as
they
are
never
venders
themselves
selling
always
by
the
wholesale
their
language
is
different
from
all
the
others
but
they
also
speak
spanish
the
women
are
sweet
and
innocent
they
look
at
one
with
a
smile
as
frank
as
a
baby
and
are
undoubtedly
the
handsomest
and
cleanest
people
in
the
republic
i
would
not
have
missed
them
for
anything
and
can
now
believe
there
are
some
indians
like
the
writers
of
old
painted
them
in
the
time
of
maximilian
a
colony
of
americans
asked
the
emperor
for
land
on
which
to
settle
he
kindly
gave
them
their
own
choice
and
they
settled
at
cordoba
where
they
had
the
advantage
of
the
tropical
clime
and
were
secure
from
yellow
fever
they
were
three
hundred
in
number
and
in
a
short
time
with
true
american
industry
they
made
business
brisk
three
american
hotels
were
established
and
the
plantations
were
the
finest
and
most
prosperous
in
the
land
maximilian
looked
on
the
little
band
with
favor
and
gave
them
ample
aid
and
protection
during
the
rebellion
the
liberty
party
made
raids
on
their
homes
destroyed
their
property
and
not
only
made
them
prisoners
and
hurried
them
off
to
yucatan
a
place
from
which
there
is
no
escape
but
murdered
them
whenever
they
wanted
some
new
amusement
maximilian
was
powerless
to
help
those
who
had
prospered
under
his
care
and
just
when
he
was
to
be
shot
the
last
of
the
colony
who
feared
the
liberty
party
deserted
their
once
happy
homes
and
went
to
another
country
only
one
remained
a
russell
who
has
been
the
solitary
american
here
for
twenty
years
the
hotels
have
disappeared
and
the
plantations
now
possessed
by
mexicans
bear
no
traces
of
their
once
tidy
and
prosperous
appearance
this
is
the
history
of
the
first
and
last
american
colony
ever
formed
in
mexico
given
me
by
the
last
remaining
colonist
who
reminds
one
of
the
last
chief
inconsolable
and
disconsolate
keeping
vigil
at
the
tombs
of
his
people
until
death
shall
claim
him
too
chapter
xxi
a
mexican
arcadia
if
you
come
over
here
you
will
get
a
better
view
spoke
a
gentleman
as
he
came
from
the
back
end
of
the
car
hauling
us
from
cordoba
to
this
place
we
were
nearly
breaking
our
backs
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
look
over
a
man
and
wife
surrounded
by
almost
as
many
children
as
belonged
to
the
old
woman
in
the
shoe
down
the
perpendicular
side
of
the
mountain
into
the
deep
ravine
beneath
we
took
a
survey
of
the
speaker
of
his
light
woolen
suit
with
wide
sombrero
to
match
his
pleasant
handsome
face
and
mentally
decided
that
he
was
not
only
worth
looking
at
but
also
worth
talking
to
by
the
time
the
train
had
passed
the
barranca
we
were
in
a
deep
conversation
quite
after
the
manner
of
americans
and
although
none
of
us
asked
any
impudent
questions
we
were
discussing
marriage
and
women
rights
i
think
every
woman
should
be
taught
some
useful
occupation
he
said
and
their
education
should
be
unlimited
but
the
one
great
fault
of
the
world
is
not
paying
a
woman
what
she
is
worth
there
are
few
things
in
which
a
woman
is
able
to
sell
her
talents
at
the
same
price
as
a
man
and
it
is
a
reproach
to
humanity
that
it
is
so
i
have
three
daughters
now
at
school
the
oldest
is
studying
to
be
a
physician
the
second
has
great
artistic
ability
which
she
is
cultivating
and
the
third
is
a
good
musician
in
either
of
these
vocations
they
can
take
their
place
among
men
and
receive
the
same
recompense
i
am
living
in
orizaba
now
he
continued
and
have
been
hunting
deer
for
the
past
few
days
just
below
cordoba
we
saw
plenty
but
our
man
and
dogs
did
not
understand
the
game
so
we
returned
empty
handed
the
only
thing
wounded
is
my
friend
back
there
who
fell
out
of
a
hammock
while
we
were
away
and
sprained
his
ankle
as
we
told
him
orizaba
was
also
our
destination
the
next
question
was
where
did
we
intend
to
stop
and
found
it
was
the
place
where
he
lived
after
he
had
given
the
wounded
man
into
the
care
of
friends
we
got
on
a
car
and
soon
reached
our
hotel
it
was
so
dainty
and
nice
that
i
can
not
resist
a
brief
description
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
may
some
day
be
in
its
locality
it
is
known
as
the
la
borda
and
is
near
the
station
as
well
as
the
best
in
the
town
the
rooms
are
a
model
of
cleanliness
and
neatly
furnished
from
the
front
one
can
survey
part
of
the
village
and
the
range
of
mountains
outlined
against
the
sky
like
immense
waves
each
one
climbing
higher
and
above
all
the
great
mountain
that
majestic
monument
which
wears
its
snowy
nightcap
seventeen
thousand
two
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
at
the
rear
of
the
house
just
below
the
windows
is
a
waterfall
which
goes
to
feed
some
mills
in
the
vicinity
in
the
first
glimmer
of
day
with
our
wakening
senses
we
hear
its
murmuring
song
with
that
of
the
birds
its
sound
is
in
a
gentle
manner
as
though
enticing
the
birds
to
come
nearer
to
its
brink
and
bathe
their
toes
and
quench
their
thirst
with
its
foaming
waves
near
it
gets
loud
and
boisterous
and
you
seem
to
hear
the
day
is
short
improve
your
time
over
and
over
with
a
monotony
that
rather
fascinates
us
directly
above
this
wonderful
fall
is
a
cozy
little
garden
cultivated
by
the
landlady
who
also
deserves
a
word
she
is
a
german
who
accompanied
her
husband
to
this
country
some
years
ago
he
died
and
left
her
in
a
strange
land
with
two
baby
girls
whom
she
maintains
by
running
this
hotel
she
is
quite
pretty
and
speaks
german
and
spanish
fluently
while
she
is
studying
english
and
understands
some
now
she
keeps
her
house
like
most
germans
as
clean
as
it
can
possibly
be
made
and
endeavors
to
have
all
her
guests
feel
at
home
the
cooking
is
so
good
and
everything
so
comfortable
that
one
would
fain
have
the
little
german
woman
and
the
la
borda
in
every
town
in
the
republic
orizaba
is
a
beautiful
little
valley
surrounded
by
a
chain
of
majestic
mountains
the
houses
are
white
and
most
generally
of
one
and
two
stories
there
are
inhabitants
it
was
for
a
long
time
the
capital
of
vera
cruz
when
this
place
was
first
founded
in
the
year
by
the
tlascaltacas
its
original
name
was
ahanializapan
which
translated
meant
pleasure
in
or
on
the
water
the
people
prospered
and
lived
in
peace
and
happiness
until
the
aztec
emperor
montezuma
reduced
them
to
his
dominion
in
still
under
such
a
good
and
wise
king
they
could
not
be
otherwise
than
happy
in
this
lovely
garden
until
gonzalo
sandoval
undertook
and
was
successful
in
conquering
them
in
but
even
war
did
not
stop
its
progress
and
in
ten
years
later
in
the
governor
gave
it
its
present
name
the
valley
of
orizaba
the
people
grew
in
intelligence
and
were
industrious
and
religious
in
they
built
their
first
parish
church
gonzalode
olmedo
and
as
early
as
had
put
up
a
building
and
opened
their
first
school
inhabitants
increased
rapidly
and
in
it
took
the
rank
of
town
not
satisfied
yet
they
built
up
and
the
population
increased
by
birth
and
new
settlers
until
in
it
was
declared
to
be
a
city
orizaba
was
for
a
long
time
capital
of
its
state
vera
cruz
and
is
now
the
pleasure
and
health
resort
for
people
from
all
over
the
republic
besides
being
the
home
of
the
wealthy
people
of
vera
cruz
no
yellow
fever
or
any
of
the
other
diseases
come
to
this
dainty
valley
yet
twelve
doctors
are
holding
forth
and
trying
to
gain
a
living
in
the
vicinity
all
are
spanish
with
the
exception
of
one
an
austrian
and
only
two
speak
english
one
of
whom
used
to
write
for
an
american
paper
for
the
entire
population
there
are
but
three
baths
banos
but
the
poor
can
go
to
the
river
which
runs
near
by
the
only
amusements
are
the
billiard
hall
bowling
alley
and
two
fine
theaters
one
contains
lunetas
eighteen
plateas
nineteen
palcos
and
one
galeria
the
other
cost
and
has
a
magnificent
interior
it
has
lunetas
eighty
balconies
three
grilles
thirteen
and
thirteen
palcos
and
one
galeria
on
the
map
there
are
recorded
but
eleven
churches
but
even
from
our
hotel
window
we
could
count
many
times
the
number
those
recorded
are
the
san
antonio
calverio
concordid
las
dolores
santa
gertrudes
san
jose
de
gracia
san
juan
de
dios
san
maria
tercer
orden
and
la
parroquis
which
is
the
largest
and
finest
it
is
situated
in
the
zocalo
and
has
had
its
steeple
knocked
off
three
times
by
earthquakes
the
latter
seem
to
have
a
special
grudge
against
this
one
church
for
although
they
have
caused
the
towers
of
many
others
to
lean
they
have
never
shaken
any
of
them
completely
down
orizaba
must
be
a
very
naughty
child
beautiful
children
most
always
are
for
dame
nature
often
gives
it
a
shaking
she
is
an
indulgent
and
not
very
severe
mother
as
little
or
no
damage
is
ever
done
by
the
correction
excepting
to
this
one
cathedral
during
our
stay
the
earth
shivered
as
though
struck
with
a
chill
but
the
people
paid
no
more
attention
to
it
than
we
do
to
a
summer
shower
not
half
so
much
in
fact
as
we
do
when
the
mentioned
shower
threatens
to
ruin
our
easter
bonnet
two
little
spanish
papers
of
four
pages
or
two
sheets
about
inches
square
retail
at
twelve
and
a
half
cents
and
furnish
the
news
for
the
inhabitants
the
children
here
should
not
be
lacking
in
education
as
there
are
ten
schools
for
boys
and
six
for
girls
they
can
start
at
any
age
and
go
as
long
as
they
wish
besides
this
the
government
sustains
a

college
of
one

students
at
the
yearly
cost
of
eleven
thousand

two

orizaba
has
rather
a
big
heart
they
furnish
a
free
home
for
men
and
one
for
women
with
hospitals
attached
but
one
do
dare
mention
their
cleanliness
or
order
they
are
under
the
superintendence
of
the
board
of
charity
there
is
also
a
retreat
for
the
insane
which
like
ours
in
the
states
occupies
a
spot
free
from
all
other
habitations
the
last

statistics
shows
that
they
received
indirect

municipal

are
scarce
there
being
only
three
besides
one
lithographer
one
public
garden
two
photographers
one
dentist
four
established
cigarette
manufactories
and
one
lottery
for
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
mexican
town
without
there
are
no
americans
in
the
town
except
those
who
belong
to
the
railroad
many
things
of
interest
are
to
be
seen
in
and
around
orizaba
one
who
cares
to
climb
can
ascend
the
cerro
del
berrego
and
view
the
old
ruins
which
mark
the
spot
where
the
mexicans
were
defeated
during
the
french
invasion
june
a
little
way
out
is
jalapilla
where
maximilian
resided
a
short
time
after
the
french
army
had
gone
and
where
he
held
the
famous
council
to
determine
whether
he
should
abdicate
or
not
one
and
a
half
miles
south
are
large
sugar
plantations
and
mills
besides
there
are
several
waterfalls
between
two
and
five
miles
distant
noted
for
their
beauty
and
strangeness
the
cascade
rincon
grande
is
about
one
mile
east
the
water
has
a
fall
of
over
fifty
feet
and
all
around
is
a
luxuriant
growth
of
vegetation
which
helps
to
make
the
spot
one
of
the
prettiest
in
mexico
donn
tonardo
cordoba
is
a
fall
which
disappears
in
a
round
hole
in
the
earth
falling
to
a
depth
that
has
never
been
measured
another
thing
interesting
to
foreigners
are
the
old
spanish
deeds
written
on
parchment
during
the
time
of
cortes
they
can
be
seen
at
the
register
office
by
giving
the
man
in
charge
two
reals
for
his
trouble
on
sunday
afternoon
are
held
in
an
old
convent
and
what
was
once
a
fine
church
is
now
the
barracks
for
a
garrison
and
hall
for
the
masonic
lodge
many
people
have
a
fancy
to
climb
the
peak
of
orizaba
which
is
feet
high
it
requires
but
five
hours
of
a
good
climb
to
reach
the
summit
the
last
eruptions
it
had
were
in
and
several
times
it
has
been
reported
smoking
but
the
rumors
were
finally
on
investigation
pronounced
unfounded
the
people
occupy
one
and
houses
with
overhanging
and
tile
roofs
while
the
poor
class
construct
their
mansions
out
of
old
boards
sugar
cane
stalks
barrel
staves
pieces
of
matting
bricks
and
thatch
them
with
palm
leaves
and
dried
strips
of
maguey
their
floor
is
always
the
ground
the
highest
temperature
in
the
shade
at
orizaba
is
the
lowest
but
the
average
is
mostly
with
always
an
east
wind
prevailing
orizaba
is
a
delightful
place
for
a
stranger
to
stroll
about
in
we
started
out
to
see
the
town
without
guide
or
companion
and
felt
ourselves
fully
repaid
by
the
many
strange
and
delightful
things
we
saw
we
went
to
the
market
which
is
situated
on
an
open
square
and
examined
all
the
curious
things
the
birds
especially
attracted
our
attention
the
many
varieties
colors
and
shapes
and
the
extremely
low
prices
some
selling
for
a
medio
cents
others
for
a
real
young
parrots
were
fifty
cents
and
buglers
a
bird
shaped
like
the
but
lighter
in
color
and
far
superior
in
song
and
all
that
restrains
one
from
making
a
large
investment
is
the
fact
that
many
can
not
live
in
cages
as
none
know
on
what
food
they
subsist
consequently
they
have
to
die
little
dogs
with
bright
black
eyes
and
hair
fine
as
silk
about
three
to
five
inches
in
length
sell
for
while
the
famous
chihuahua
dog
which
weighs
about
half
a
pound
when
full
grown
commands
from
to
since
tourists
have
ruined
the
prices
out
by
the
unlucky
cathedral
we
saw
the
hearse
of
the
town
it
is
the
shape
of
a
coffin
held
aloft
by
springs
above
four
wheels
it
is
draped
with
crape
and
plumes
two
black
mules
stuck
with
plumes
on
every
available
spot
draw
it
and
the
driver
dressed
in
black
with
high
hat
decorated
with
a
plume
handles
the
reins
perched
on
a
small
seat
about
four
feet
above
the
rest
of
the
hearse
the
coffin
is
slid
in
at
the
back
or
end
like
the
case
in
which
coffins
are
often
hermetically
scaled
selecting
a
poor
street
we
started
to
make
our
way
toward
the
mountains
on
it
we
found
a
row
of
houses
numbered
in
the
following
style
january
february
march
april
may
june
july
august
september
october
november
december
still
further
down
we
saw
one
called
the
place
of
providence
each
different
door
designated
as
the
place
of
providence
a
the
place
of
providence
b
and
so
on
throughout
the
alphabet
next
we
came
to
a
laundry
which
did
not
remind
us
in
the
least
of
those
at
home
the
river
was
the
tub
a
porous
stone
the
washboard
and
the
little
bushes
and
green
bank
the
clothesline
in
this
manner
all
the
washing
of
the
town
is
done
we
admired
the
washwomen
for
quite
a
while
as
they
rubbed
the
clothes
on
the
stone
and
then
doused
them
up
and
down
in
the
stream
at
last
we
concluded
to
jump
across
and
go
down
on
the
other
side
but
we
forgot
we
were
women
and
that
the
dress
of
last
fall
was
extremely
narrow
we
jumped
from
one
washboard
to
another
we
landed
on
it
all
right
but
we
did
not
stay
long
but
slipped
back
into
the
water
which
was
about
three
feet
deep
much
to
our
consternation
on
our
way
home
we
stopped
at
the
tivoli
the
and
the
main
alameda
which
is
situated
at
the
foot
of
an
immense
mountain
and
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
prettiest
in
the
republic
the
walks
and
drives
are
wide
and
nicely
paved
a
great
variety
of
trees
furnish
the
shade
and
musical
fountains
are
plentiful
a
music
stand
is
in
the
center
and
is
occupied
nightly
by
a
good
band
the
were
getting
their
supply
from
one
of
the
large
basins
they
were
also
different
from
others
we
have
seen
they
have
a
long
pole
across
their
shoulders
and
suspended
from
each
end
is
a
bucket
containing
the
water
after
the
style
of
the
milkmaids
in
the
states
it
seems
strange
that
though
every
city
has
its
and
that
every
one
in
the
same
town
carries
exactly
alike
yet
in
no
two
towns
do
they
carry
in
the
same
manner
i
can
not
forget
to
introduce
you
to
the
pleasant
gentleman
we
met
on
the
train
he
is
baker
her
britannic
majesty
consul
at
vera
cruz
he
speaks
fluently
fifteen
different
languages
and
when
i
asked
him
if
he
was
not
very
proud
of
the
fact
he
replied
yes
until
i
met
a
waiter
in
a
restaurant
who
could
speak
eighteen
he
is
a
widower
and
came
here
accompanied
by
his
only
son
while
his
three
daughters
are
at
school
in
europe
the
common
expression
made
of
him
here
is
that
he
is
good
enough
for
an
american
now
you
can
judge
how
agreeable
he
is
he
has
been
knighted
three
different
times
and
was
colonel
in
two
different
armies
yet
he
is
still
plain
baker
oh
i
had
ancestors
he
said
jokingly
as
we
were
discussing
little
vanities
and
they
came
over
in
the
ship
of
the
conquerors
also
my
forefather
was
a
cook
one
day
the
bread
was
exhausted
and
there
was
no
way
to
procure
more
so
the
cook
made
some
pancakes
and
waited
in
terror
while
they
were
taken
in
to
his
majesty
at
last
he
got
a
summons
to
appear
before
him
trembling
and
expecting
to
be
beheaded
the
poor
fellow
sank
at
his
sovereign
feet
when
instead
of
a
sentence
to
be
executed
he
heard
sir
baker
since
then
that
has
been
the
family
name
accompanied
by
baker
we
started
north
to
see
a
waterfall
and
to
take
the
train
at
the
next
station
we
got
in
a
car
and
went
winding
in
between
the
high
mountains
from
which
the
black
marble
is
quarried
until
we
reached
a
stretch
of
land
where
we
alighted
and
crossed
the
fields
until
we
came
to
that
wonderful
stream
the
water
is
quite
cold
and
mineral
and
as
clear
as
crystal
one
being
able
to
see
the
bottom
at
the
depth
of
twenty
feet
as
though
there
was
no
water
intervening
down
where
the
water
was
more
shallow
were
several
horses
fishing
for
the
grass
that
grows
in
the
bottom
they
thrust
in
their
heads
until
their
eyes
were
in
the
water
and
then
pulled
out
a
mouthful
of
grass
they
made
a
beautiful
picture
baths
are
situated
here
and
trees
grow
around
just
plentiful
enough
to
be
pretty
foot
logs
span
the
stream
and
the
cool
green
velvety
plots
invite
a
longer
stay
on
one
foot
log
we
discovered
what
appeared
to
be
walking
leaves
as
the
green
leaves
glided
along
moved
by
an
unseen
power
investigation
proved
them
to
be
an
army
of
ants
each
one
carrying
a
leaf
on
its
back
which
looked
like
a
little
sail
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
half
in
the
water
half
out
lay
a
branch
of
willow
these
little
things
climbed
it
risking
life
and
limb
and
cutting
off
a
leaf
hoisted
it
on
their
backs
and
marched
easily
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
their
home
they
had
a
path
of
road
about
five
inches
wide
made
along
the
grass
all
the
distance
the
street
cleaners
must
be
faithful
as
it
was
as
clean
as
could
be
shaded
on
either
side
by
the
grass
without
one
blade
in
their
way
they
crossed
the
foot
log
and
disappeared
in
a
hole
at
the
other
end
we
wondered
what
they
were
making
inside
with
those
many
leaves
they
were
so
interesting
at
their
work
that
it
was
with
reluctance
we
left
them
boarding
our
train
with
much
regret
we
were
soon
lost
to
sight
of
the
valley
of
orizaba
and
were
once
more
on
our
way
to
a
new
and
strange
city
chapter
xxii
the
wonders
of
puebla
if
the
tourists
believed
all
that
is
told
them
here
they
would
conclude
that
every
spot
and
town
of
interest
had
been
built
by
the
virgin
and
the
angels
one
night
many
many
years
ago
so
the
story
runs
one
good
priest
who
was
known
by
the
name
of
motolinia
which
means
humble
mean
lowly
had
a
vision
a
number
of
sweet
angels
all
of
the
feminine
gender
draped
with
some
soft
thin
material
with
long
silky
black
hair
that
fell
to
their
feet
in
heavy
folds
and
sparkling
black
eyes
took
the
good
father
in
their
arms
and
bore
him
through
the
air
to
a
spot
not
far
distant
from
his
little
hut
after
setting
up
a
stone
cross
which
at
their
petition
apparently
descended
from
the
skies
they
helped
him
to
build
churches
houses
factories
and
perhaps
it
took
seven
days
and
the
same
number
of
nights
to
build
the
world
but
the
city
of
puebla
was
built
in
a
few
moments
probably
the
fatigue
from
work
or
the
unusual
company
made
the
good
man
tired
and
drowsy
so
he
fell
asleep
as
sweetly
as
a
babe
fanned
by
the
wings
of
the
heavenly
beings
around
him
waking
from
a
most
refreshing
nap
in
which
he
had
dreamed
of
honey
golden
crowns
feathered
wings
and
regiments
of
beautiful
creatures
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
once
again
in
his
little
bed
with
no
angels
in
sight
they
have
gone
out
to
complete
the
work
while
i
lazy
creature
slept
thought
the
good
father
and
going
to
the
window
he
flung
it
open
he
saw
the
green
plain
undisturbed
at
first
he
was
surprised
and
disappointed
and
had
he
been
a
dyspeptic
all
would
have
ended
there
and
this
story
would
not
have
to
be
told
but
like
a
good
and
faithful
believer
he
worked
out
a
solution
of
the
strange
vision
which
was
that
the
angels
had
appeared
to
show
they
wanted
the
work
done
and
how
but
he
must
accomplish
it
himself
to
prove
beyond
doubt
their
visit
the
stone
cross
was
left
standing
where
their
angelic
hands
had
placed
it
so
encouraged
and
with
great
faith
he
related
his
vision
to
the
people
and
with
their
aid
began
to
build
the
city
of
puebla
around
the
stone
cross
leaving
more
than
a
square
vacant
where
it
stood
this
was
three
hundred
and
years
ago
on
the
of
april
the
square
is
now
used
for
the
city
market
and
the
stone
cross
revered
and
respected
is
standing
in
the
courtyard
of
what
was
the
convent
of
santo
domingo
but
now
a
church
where
at
the
same
place
they
will
take
from
the
altar
and
show
you
a
coat
which
was
once
worn
by
a
very
holy
monk
and
for
some
good
act
the
virgin
stamped
her
picture
on
the
sleeve
of
it
it
is
very
interesting
to
look
at
even
if
one
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
possess
but
little
faith
the
most
interesting
thing
in
puebla
is
its
churches
every
one
has
some
wonderful
tale
attached
puebla
was
named
in
honor
of
its
first
visitors
puebla
de
los
angles
town
of
the
angels
but
it
is
very
seldom
spoken
of
except
as
puebla
the
of
the
first
church
was
laid
in
and
that
of
the
first
cathedral
in
both
of
these
buildings
have
disappeared
as
they
were
originally
though
it
is
proven
that
part
of
the
former
is
the
present
sagrario
covered
with
parasites
and
in
almost
utter
ruins
the
present
cathedral
was
finished
in
and
is
one
of
the
finest
and
most
expensive
in
mexico
one
of
its
towers
alone
cost
the
high
altar
composed
of
mexican
marble
and
onyx
is
one
of
the
finest
ever
constructed
it
is
said
to
have
cost
this
altar
before
the
reform
was
loaded
with
gold
silver
and
jewels
the
bishops
sepulcher
is
beneath
a
beautiful
carving
in
ivory
of
the
virgin
which
was
completed
after
three
years
hard
labor
and
a
wonderful
curtain
which
was
a
present
from
the
king
of
spain
as
well
as
the
dungeons
beneath
are
a
few
of
the
things
worth
seeing
it
has
eighteen
bells
the
largest
weighs
nine
tons
the
chapel
of
conquistadora
contains
an
image
of
the
senora
de
los
remedios
which
was
presented
by
cortes
to
the
hascallan
don
axotecatl
cocomitzin
for
his
good
help
and
friendship
during
the
time
of
the
bitter
war
with
the
other
natives
upon
the
main
altar
lie
the
remains
of
the
man
who
first
introduced
oxen
into
mexico
and
who
for
many
years
was
the
means
of
passage
and
communication
between
mexico
and
vera
cruz
his
name
was
sebastian
de
aparicio
he
was
born
in
and
died
after
living
a
good
and
useful
life
in
at
the
dominican
monastery
they
showed
half
the
handkerchief
on
which
the
virgin
wept
and
wiped
her
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
the
people
claim
that
san
jose
protects
their
town
from
lightning
so
they
built
a
church
named
in
his
honor
and
have
in
it
a
strange
image
carved
from
what
was
a
tree
another
beautiful
church
has
a
picture
of
a
saint
which
has
been
heard
to
speak
still
another
contains
thorns
from
the
crown
of
christ
nearly
every
two
squares
boasts
a
church
and
every
church
has
some
wonderful
history
connected
with
it
the
church
of
san
francisco
which
was
founded
by
the
good
priest
motolinia
the
father
of
puebla
was
established
a
short
time
after
the
city
and
is
worth
seeing
if
from
nothing
else
than
an
architectural
point
of
view
the
choir
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
existence
it
is
flat
and
looks
as
though
it
would
tumble
down
every
moment
even
the
man
who
built
it
fled
for
fear
it
would
fall
when
taking
out
the
supporting
beams
and
kill
them
all
the
monks
then
decided
to
burn
them
down
and
then
if
the
choir
fell
no
one
would
be
hurt
well
they
burned
and
crumbled
down
but
the
choir
still
remained
firm
and
does
to
this
day
after
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
constant
use
puebla
is
fully
seventy
miles
from
the
city
of
mexico
and
is
the
capital
of
the
state
of
the
same
name
it
is
one
of
the
cleanest
and
prettiest
towns
in
the
republic
and
has
at
the
least
inhabitants
it
is
full
of
interesting
historical
events
cortes
located
here
general
de
zaragoza
won
a
victory
over
the
french
here
on
the
of
may
and
general
diaz
now
president
won
a
more
brilliant
victory
and
gained
greater
fame
for
himself
here
in
the
war
five
years
later
april
both
events
are
celebrated
in
fine
style
every
year
puebla
is
not
situated
on
the
main
line
of
the
vera
cruz
line
but
connects
with
a
narrow
gauge
which
runs
to
apizaco
miles
distant
it
takes
from
to
to
make
the
trip
but
one
forgets
the
length
of
time
by
looking
at
the
beautiful
valley
which
surrounds
them
when
we
were
out
a
short
distance
by
looking
back
over
the
way
we
traveled
we
saw
between
two
large
hills
surrounded
by
trees
flowers
and
rocks
the
cascade
del
molino
de
san
diego
showing
just
over
the
top
of
the
falling
waters
a
fine
old
stone
mill
inclosed
with
a
variety
of
different
green
trees
all
of
which
seem
to
be
springing
out
of
the
waters
whose
fall
faces
us
next
we
pass
the
pretty
little
village
of
santa
anna
interesting
not
only
because
it
is
named
in
honor
of
the
old
warrior
but
for
its
people
and
the
many
odd
things
which
they
make
so
deftly
and
sell
to
passing
tourists
mexican
drinks
and
ice
cream
called
agua
a
nieve
snow
water
made
simply
by
pouring
sweetened
and
flavored
milk
over
snow
which
is
brought
down
from
the
volcano
popocatapetl
and
the
white
lady
between
here
and
our
destination
we
can
see
by
the
door
of
every
little
hut
a
large
clay
object
shaped
somewhat
like
an
urn
taller
even
than
the
houses
they
are
translated
into
english
keepers
and
hold
the
water
used
by
the
people
they
have
no
wells
as
they
carry
their
supply
from
a
river
many
miles
away
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
a
deep
bluff
although
water
is
very
scarce
in
the
majority
of
places
in
mexico
this
is
the
only
spot
where
one
finds
the
keepers
another
town
and
we
enter
the
city
of
puebla
as
it
nestles
down
between
a
chain
of
mountains
like
a
kitten
in
the
sun
with
a
view
from
some
high
tower
it
looks
like
a
flower
garden
dotted
here
and
there
with
picturesque
houses
on
the
west
is
popocatapetl
and
ixtaelhuatl
sending
down
an
and
invigorating
breeze
which
plays
with
their
snowy
robes
and
then
descends
into
the
green
valley
to
salute
the
hot
brows
of
mortals
there
with
a
kiss
of
health
and
happiness
the
coat
of
arms
was
given
to
puebla
by
charles
of
spain
in
july
of
the
inhabitants
thirty
thousand
seven
hundred
are
men
and
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
women
besides
more
than
thirteen
thousand
people
who
work
in
public
establishments
which
number
in
all
about
one
hundred
there
are
paper
cotton
flour
and
wax
taper
mills
the
people
are
very
religious
and
fall
on
their
knees
when
the
bishop
carriage
passes
even
if
it
is
unoccupied
they
have
plenty
of
policemen
at
night
though
nearly
everybody
has
retired
by
and
not
only
are
they
on
the
streets
but
on
the
housetops
we
saw
the
little
red
lanterns
blazing
forth
from
almost
every
other
house
and
being
of
an
inquisitive
turn
we
made
inquiries
and
learned
the
above
facts
they
look
very
odd
and
on
a
dark
night
one
can
see
nothing
but
the
red
light
gleaming
forth
like
a
danger
signal
the
policemen
are
all
well
armed
but
it
strikes
an
american
that
the
lanterns
are
displayed
so
that
their
owners
can
not
accidentally
get
hurt
the
city
supports
several
free
hospitals
the
finest
one
was
established
a
few
years
since
and
is
the
best
building
of
the
kind
in
mexico
three
days
after
the
death
of
luis
rharo
a
bachelor
of
considerable
wealth
they
found
in
his
bible
a
will
leaving
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
build
this
home
and
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
be
invested
and
used
to
maintain
the
same
the
three
men
named
as
executors
clemente
lopez
marin
and
gutiores
were
all
wealthy
but
were
to
receive
for
managing
and
looking
after
the
home
apiece
the
building
alone
was
to
cost
and
after
it
was
finished
the
contractor
tamaris
would
accept
no
pay
and
allowed
the
price
to
go
back
into
the
original
sum
the
building
is
marble
the
floor
marble
tile
the
decorations
carved
onyx
and
this
palatial
mansion
is
the
home
of
hundreds
of
and
deserted
mothers
and
babies
when
mexico
feels
charitably
inclined
she
does
it
on
a
grand
scale
no
business
like
in
many
places
in
the
states
the
houses
here
are
generally
with
flat
roofs
and
fronts
inlaid
with
highly
glazed
tile
or
else
gaudily
painted
all
the
windows
facing
the
street
have
iron
balconies
and
all
the
courts
are
filled
with
flowers
birds
and
fountains
there
were
once
churches
nine
monasteries
and
thirty
nunneries
but
the
latter
have
been
abolished
and
with
the
exception
of
a
half
dozen
they
are
used
as
churches
one
is
a
round
house
for
the
engines
another
formed
the
theater
for
the
there
are
but
two
small
protestant
churches
which
are
not
well
attended
since
the
rebellion
there
have
been
established
schools
with
an
attendance
of
only
children
the
college
of
medicine
and
academy
of
arts
and
science
are
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
town
free
to
all
who
care
to
go
the
famous
pyramid
of
cholula
is
but
eight
miles
from
the
city
street
cars
run
out
about
four
times
a
day
and
charge
fifty
cents
a
trip
on
the
way
we
passed
a
large
rock
which
has
caused
a
sensation
lately
it
is
about
two
hundred
feet
high
and
at
the
very
least
six
hundred
feet
around
the
base
it
looks
very
strange
lying
on
an
otherwise
level
green
space
for
acres
around
the
stone
is
covered
with
parasitical
orchids
and
ferns
and
has
been
known
to
the
oldest
natives
by
the
name
of
cascomate
no
one
ever
thought
much
about
it
except
to
wonder
how
such
an
immense
rock
got
into
an
otherwise
rockless
spot
some
advanced
the
opinion
that
it
had
been
thrown
there
during
one
of
the
eruptions
of
popocatapetl
when
it
merited
the
name
of
the
smoking
mountain
a
german
who
spends
much
of
his
time
searching
for
the
queer
in
mexico
thought
one
morning
as
he
was
taking
a
walk
about
ten
days
ago
that
he
would
climb
to
the
top
of
this
rock
and
take
a
view
of
the
valley
the
ascent
was
very
difficult
but
he
persevered
and
on
reaching
the
top
was
surprised
to
find
a
big
opening
yawning
at
his
feet
the
stench
coming
from
it
was
very
strong
so
lighting
his
strongest
cigar
he
begun
to
investigate
the
opening
was
about
fifty
feet
in
circumference
and
easily
the
same
depth
at
the
bottom
were
lying
several
skeletons
he
quickly
returned
to
town
and
reported
his
discovery
but
so
far
no
investigations
have
been
made
one
man
who
was
talking
over
it
said
please
do
not
put
it
in
your
paper
because
mexico
has
a
nasty
name
for
foreigners
now
that
stone
he
continued
was
used
by
duelists
to
hide
their
victim
body
and
when
the
people
perceived
a
stench
they
reported
it
to
the
police
who
always
investigated
and
had
the
body
buried
if
that
is
true
why
is
it
that
everybody
considers
the
find
new
and
startling
and
no
one
has
come
forth
to
say
he
knows
what
use
it
was
put
to
before
this
if
the
police
investigated
and
took
out
the
bodies
why
did
they
not
have
the
hole
filled
up
and
why
are
there
so
many
skeletons
in
it
at
the
present
day
he
did
not
try
to
answer
these
questions
but
only
begged
our
silence
cholula
retains
little
of
its
grandeur
at
the
commencement
of
the
sixteenth
century
cortes
compared
it
to
the
largest
cities
of
spain
but
with
the
growth
of
puebla
it
has
diminished
until
the
present
day
it
is
but
a
small
village
its
streets
are
broad
and
unpaved
the
houses
one
story
with
flat
roofs
and
there
is
little
to
attract
one
although
they
have
some
few
manufacturers
except
the
pyramid
and
some
of
the
old
churches
one
of
these
churches
was
formerly
a
fortification
built
by
cortes
it
is
a
fine
massive
stone
building
of
immense
size
perfect
cannon
of
medium
size
answer
for
on
the
roof
in
the
door
of
the
main
entrance
there
are
nails
no
two
of
which
are
alike
when
the
building
was
being
erected
there
were
many
skilled
blacksmiths
in
the
vicinity
each
was
desirous
of
showing
his
skill
so
with
chisel
and
hammer
they
made
these
long
nails
and
presented
them
to
the
conqueror
making
the
door
one
of
the
strange
things
of
mexico
in
another
church
near
here
also
erected
at
the
command
of
cortes
is
a
black
velvet
altar
cloth
with
saints
embroidered
in
gold
all
over
it
the
workmanship
is
exquisite
and
some
of
the
likenesses
perfect
there
is
also
a
black
velvet
vestment
embroidered
in
the
same
manner
which
is
only
for
use
in
holy
week
they
were
both
a
present
from
charles
of
spain
the
bishop
of
mexico
has
been
anxious
to
obtain
possession
of
them
and
has
repeatedly
offered
for
the
two
pieces
but
they
refuse
to
sell
at
that
price
this
church
is
known
as
the
royal
chapel
its
architecture
is
very
pretty
yet
extremely
odd
every
way
one
counts
across
the
chapel
gives
seven
arches
lengthwise
cornerwise
the
end
is
always
the
same
seven
in
the
center
of
this
queer
construction
is
a
pure
well
the
waters
of
which
are
noted
for
their
coolness
healing
qualities
and
love
charms
one
strange
fact
about
this
church
is
that
the
morning
following
its
dedication
it
fell
to
the
ground
completely
demolished
but
was
immediately
rebuilt
in
this
vicinity
there
are
no
less
than
churches
which
can
be
counted
nestling
within
a
very
small
space
from
the
pyramid
which
is
left
for
another
chapter
chapter
xxiii
the
pyramid
of
cholula
the
pyramid
of
cholula
is
very
disappointing
to
any
one
who
has
seen
illustrations
of
it
in
histories
of
mexico
there
it
is
represented
as
a
mass
of
steps
growing
narrower
as
they
reach
the
top
at
present
it
looks
like
many
of
the
other
hills
which
one
sees
so
frequently
in
mexico
closer
inspection
shows
there
were
once
four
stories
to
it
but
it
is
now
badly
demolished
and
the
trainway
has
cut
through
one
side
damaging
the
effect
at
present
it
is
three
thousand
eight
hundred
and
sixty
feet
around
the
base
although
once
it
is
said
to
have
been
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty
feet
on
each
side
or
four
times
that
around
the
entire
base
some
say
its
height
is
no
more
than
two
hundred
feet
while
others
affirm
it
is
at
the
very
least
five
hundred
feet
high
the
ascent
is
made
by
a
spanish
stairway
of
hewed
stone
fifteen
feet
wide
and
there
is
a
second
stairway
of
two
hundred
steps
leading
from
the
main
one
to
the
church
door
the
little
church
on
top
was
first
built
by
the
spaniards
in
the
place
of
the
temple
called
quetzalcoatl
the
god
of
the
air
built
by
the
aztecs
the
church
was
first
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
but
alterations
have
been
made
of
late
years
destroying
entirely
the
original
design
it
was
dedicated
to
the
virgin
of
the
remedies
or
health
senora
de
los
remedios
and
she
is
said
to
have
performed
some
wonderful
miracles
at
any
rate
her
image
is
covered
with
tokens
of
her
goodness
there
is
a
desk
in
the
church
where
they
sell
beads
and
measures
of
the
virgin
face
which
are
said
to
keep
away
the
devil
and
bring
good
luck
to
the
wearer
a
little
tinseled
charm
on
the
beads
contains
some
part
of
the
virgin
garments
and
when
i
in
a
weak
moment
asked
the
seller
if
he
really
meant
it
i
knew
by
his
answer
i
had
met
george
washington
jr
it
was
senorita
i
can
not
lie
at
places
where
the
hill
is
dug
away
can
be
seen
the
layers
of
which
proves
undisputedly
that
the
pyramid
was
really
built
it
is
thought
to
have
served
as
a
cemetery
as
well
as
a
place
of
worship
the
indians
have
a
tradition
that
when
cortes
tarried
at
cholula
a
number
of
armed
warriors
plotted
to
fall
suddenly
upon
the
spanish
army
and
kill
them
all
cortes
may
have
had
a
suspicion
or
a
desire
for
more
blood
and
more
stolen
wealth
for
without
the
least
warning
he
attacked
the
citizens
of
puebla
and
killed
outright
besides
terribly
wounding
thousands
of
others
when
the
road
was
being
made
from
puebla
to
mexico
they
cut
through
the
first
story
of
the
pyramid
in
it
was
found
a
square
chamber
destitute
of
outlet
supported
by
beams
of
cypress
and
built
in
an
odd
and
remarkable
manner
curious
varnished
and
painted
vases
idols
in
basalt
and
skeletons
were
in
it
the
only
conclusion
offered
was
that
it
was
either
a
tomb
for
burial
or
else
the
warriors
who
wanted
revenge
on
the
spanish
were
by
some
means
buried
in
this
the
pyramid
is
now
covered
with
grass
trees
and
orchids
famous
stone
idols
are
found
in
this
vicinity
in
plowing
the
fields
or
digging
holes
they
are
turned
up
by
scores
in
all
shapes
and
sizes
the
tourist
pays
good
prices
for
them
and
the
more
sensational
the
story
attached
the
higher
the
tariff
the
guide
at
the
hotel
showed
me
a
white
arrow
flint
he
had
bought
it
the
day
before
at
cholula
for
a
medio
and
said
he
was
going
to
daub
it
with
chicken
blood
and
sell
it
to
the
next
party
of
tourists
as
a
wonderful
relic
which
had
been
used
on
the
sacrificial
stone
to
kill
thousands
of
people
he
would
tell
them
that
the
worshipers
of
the
sun
used
to
get
a
victim
and
the
one
who
could
send
the
arrow
with
this
flint
directly
in
the
center
of
the
victim
heart
stood
in
favor
with
their
god
the
sun
at
the
depot
besides
being
bothered
with
at
least
twenty
idol
peddlers
a
woman
with
a
baby
tried
to
make
me
buy
it
she
refused
to
sell
to
any
one
in
the
party
but
coaxed
me
to
take
it
telling
all
its
good
qualities
it
was
good
very
amiable
sympathetic
and
very
precious
partly
to
get
rid
of
her
i
asked
how
much
dos
reals
cents
was
her
astounding
reply
that
is
too
cheap
i
said
i
can
not
take
it
unless
the
price
is
evidently
she
did
not
understand
jesting
for
she
kept
on
saying
no
senorita
dos
reals
muy
benito
i
successfully
resisted
its
charms
as
well
as
her
persuasions
at
the
last
moment
when
the
car
started
she
ran
after
me
saying
i
could
have
the
baby
at
if
i
would
take
it
at
cents
but
the
car
soon
left
her
in
the
distance
and
we
had
a
good
laugh
at
the
poor
reasoning
powers
and
lack
of
business
qualities
the
tramway
ends
at
atlixco
a
lovely
little
village
midway
between
cholula
and
puebla
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
along
the
way
is
the
famous
tree
at
the
foot
of
michael
mountain
it
is
called
ahuehuete
it
is
many
centuries
old
and
a
very
curious
shape
its
trunk
is
hollow
with
a
hole
big
enough
for
a
horseman
to
enter
at
one
side
thirteen
men
on
horseback
can
find
plenty
of
room
in
its
big
body
the
orchards
at
this
village
are
valued
at
there
are
hotels
in
puebla
and
some
are
in
every
respect
they
serve
coffee
from
to
breakfast
to
and
dinner
to
the
penitentiary
looks
like
a
spanish
fortress
it
is
very
old
picturesque
and
covered
with
orchids
but
the
state
authorities
decided
they
needed
a
new
one
and
have
built
a
handsome
one
of
stone
and
brick
which
is
said
to
resemble
one
in
pennsylvania
whether
east
or
west
i
know
not
but
from
a
distance
it
looks
somewhat
like
the
western
although
all
similarity
faded
on
closer
inspection
there
are
several
parks
and
very
pretty
ones
too
in
puebla
in
the
main
one
they
have
music
nightly
at
the
east
end
of
the
town
they
have
sulphur
baths
which
are
considered
very
healthy
the
most
unique
of
the
whole
republic
are
held
here
one
sunday
they
fought
all
afternoon
in
the
regular
style
but
when
evening
came
they
turned
on
the
electric
lights
set
a
table
in
the
center
of
the
ring
put
on
it
tin
dishes
and
all
the
fighters
sat
down
as
though
to
eat
one
of
them
attired
in
a
long
white
dress
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
comfortably
the
gate
was
flung
open
and
the
toro
rushed
in
at
the
same
moment
two
banderillas
containing
were
stuck
into
him
and
as
they
exploded
the
maddened
bull
made
a
rush
for
the
table
the
occupants
jerked
up
the
tinware
and
with
it
began
to
fight
off
the
bull
then
they
jerked
the
table
apart
and
fought
it
with
the
pieces
when
the
men
and
beast
were
pretty
tired
the
bull
was
allowed
to
attack
the
one
in
white
the
bride
and
the
swordsman
who
of
course
represented
her
husband
defended
her
and
killed
the
bull
with
one
thrust
of
the
sword
it
was
simply
magnificent
and
so
exciting
that
everybody
was
standing
on
their
feet
yelling
lustily
at
every
new
move
the
fight
was
called
the
interrupted
bridal
party
the
next
sunday
they
fought
the
bulls
on
burros
instead
of
horses
the
men
had
their
bodies
protected
by
plates
of
tin
and
when
the
toro
charged
they
jumped
off
the
burro
and
ran
behind
screens
while
the
poor
little
animal
had
to
run
for
his
life
and
that
was
the
funniest
part
of
the
programme
the
following
sunday
all
the
fighters
stuffed
themselves
they
looked
as
if
they
had
feather
beds
around
their
bodies
then
they
dressed
up
in
fantastic
garb
no
horses
were
allowed
in
the
ring
when
the
time
came
the
men
lay
flat
on
their
backs
and
and
as
the
door
was
opened
and
the
bull
came
tearing
in
they
wiggled
their
legs
in
the
air
to
attract
its
attention
one
peculiar
feature
of
is
that
the
bull
will
never
attack
a
man
legs
but
always
strike
for
his
body
the
toro
would
rush
for
the
prostrate
form
and
the
american
auditors
would
hold
their
breath
and
think
that
the
fighter
end
had
come
but
just
then
the
bull
would
gore
him
in
the
stuffed
part
and
the
man
would
turn
a
complete
somersault
alighting
always
on
his
feet
safe
and
sound
the
bull
would
turn
those
men
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
without
either
hurting
them
or
himself
puebla
is
considered
the
richest
state
in
mexico
and
in
it
one
can
select
any
climate
he
desires
puebla
city
is
never
cold
is
never
warm
it
has
the
most
delicious
climate
in
the
world
just
the
degree
that
must
please
the
most
fastidious
in
the
state
are
wonderful
stone
quarries
every
color
of
clay
is
used
to
make
dishes
vases
and
brick
and
abundance
of
chalk
for
making
lime
in
the
rivers
and
small
streams
several
kinds
of
sand
are
secured
which
is
used
for
many
purposes
and
a
few
miles
away
are
large
veins
of
iron
and
other
minerals
there
are
mountains
of
different
varieties
of
marble
and
onyx
from
the
transparent
to
the
heaviest
known
extensive
fields
of
coal
quicksilver
lead
with
wonderful
mines
of
gold
and
silver
everywhere
there
is
one
strange
mountain
called
nahuatt
star
covered
with
rock
crystal
the
fragments
resembling
brilliant
diamonds
and
at
another
craggy
place
beautiful
emeralds
are
found
in
many
places
are
hot
springs
the
woods
are
fortunes
in
themselves
besides
all
the
mexican
varieties
are
cedar
ebony
mahogany
pine
oak
bamboo
liquid
amber
india
rubber
and
above
all
the
the
wood
of
which
has
been
pronounced
the
finest
by
five
countries
its
colored
veins
are
on
a
yellowish
ground
and
it
forms
thousands
of
strange
figures
monograms
words
and
profiles
then
there
are
the
silk
cotton
tree
the
logwood
and
thousands
of
others
some
of
them
produce
rich
essences
others
dyes
which
never
fade
a
cactus
also
grows
here
from
which
wine
is
made
which
they
say
far
excels
that
of
spain
or
italy
in
the
cold
and
warm
districts
are
raised
cotton
tobacco
vanilla
coffee
rice
tea
wheat
aniseseed
barley
pepper
chili
beans
corn
peas
and
all
the
fruits

there
are
salt
mines
and
land
where
cattle
horses
mules
burros
sheep
goats
and
pigs
are
raised
on
an
extensive
scale
the
flowers
are
so
varied
and
abundant
that
a
gentleman
who
has
been
exploring
the
paradise
says
their
products
would
supply
all
the
drug
stores
of
the
world
with
perfume
these
are
a
few
of
the
charms
of
the
state
of
puebla
there
is
quite
an
interesting
story
connected
with
the
emerald
district
the
indians
found
one
and
placed
it
on
the
altar
of
the
church
to
serve
as
a
consecration
stone
it
was
of
a
spanish
yard
or
a
little
over
english
yard
in
length
maximilian
during
his
short
reign
went
to
puebla
to
examine
it
and
offered
for
it
the
moment
the
jewel
expert
with
him
pronounced
it
extremely
fine
the
indians
refused
and
asked
afterward
an
armed
force
went
to
kill
the
tribe
and
carry
off
the
gem
but
were
themselves
whipped
the
indians
then
decided
to
bury
it
for
safe
keeping
when
a
wily
jesuit
promised
eternal
salvation
to
the
living
the
dead
and
the
unborn
if
they
would
give
it
him
in
the
name
of
the
holy
virgin
who
he
said
had
asked
for
it
the
poor
innocent
and
faithful
wretches
gave
their
immense
fortune
away
for
a
promise
that
was
worse
than
nothing
and
the
treacherous
purchaser
cut
it
into
small
portions
and
sent
it
across
the
sea
to
be
sold
he
reaping
the
benefit
the
god
quetzalcoatl
which
once
graced
the
top
of
the
pyramid
at
cholula
was
sold
to
an
american
a
few
years
since
for
a
few
miles
out
from
the
city
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
barren
plain
stands
the
magnificent
old
castle
of
perote
which
is
celebrated
in
mexican
history
as
the
last
home
of
many
of
her
senoras
who
have
either
pined
to
death
in
its
dreary
dungeons
or
been
murdered
during
revolutions
it
was
once
the
national
prison
of
the
republic
and
was
considered
one
of
the
strongest
buildings
in
the
world
even
now
it
is
stronger
and
more
formidable
than
most
fortresses
there
is
much
more
of
interest
historical
and
otherwise
to
be
seen
in
and
around
puebla
and
one
could
spend
months
of
every
day
and
still
have
something
worth
looking
at
if
a
gentleman
or
lady
resident
of
puebla
is
asked
where
their
home
is
they
will
quickly
answer
i
live
in
puebla
but
am
not
a
pueblaen
the
latter
word
translated
into
spanish
means
false
and
treacherous
hence
the
carefulness
of
the
people
always
to
add
it
i
can
not
end
this
until
i
give
you
a
sample
of
the
meanness
of
the
mexicans
other
than
indians
the
real
mexican
a
mixture
of
several
nationalities
has
a
great
greed
for
cold
cash
and
thinks
the
americano
yankee
or
gringo
was
sent
here
to
be
robbed
they
do
not
draw
the
line
on
americans
but
also
rob
the
poor
indian
of
everything
when
i
asked
for
my
hotel
bill
which
was
a
day
the
clerk
handed
me
a
bill
with
extra
what
is
the
extra
for
i
inquired
charming
senorita
he
answered
you
called
for
eggs
two
or
three
times
yes
i
replied
when
you
set
down
goat
meat
for
mutton
and
gave
me
strong
beef
i
had
seen
killed
by
the
matadore
in
the
the
day
before
well
he
continued
eggs
are
expensive
and
it
was
a
trouble
to
cook
them
my
dear
senor
i
have
no
intention
of
paying
your
salary
and
your
pocket
is
just
minus
an
expected
here
is
the
other
that
settled
it
while
looking
at
some
marble
objects
in
a
store
a
poor
indian
came
in
with
twelve
blocks
of
marble
twelve
by
twelve
on
his
back
the
poor
fellow
had
hewn
them
smooth
and
then
traveled
undoubtedly
two
days
or
more
on
foot
over
hills
and
through
valleys
the
ground
at
night
his
bed
and
the
wild
fruits
or
a
few
beans
brought
from
home
his
food
he
was
ragged
and
tired
and
dirty
but
he
had
a
good
honest
look
on
his
face
he
asked
the
shopkeeper
to
buy
the
marble
after
a
little
inspection
the
merchant
purchased
and
for
it
all
which
was
weeks
of
labor
to
the
poor
peon
and
meant
at
least
for
himself
he
gave
fifty
cents
nor
was
that
the
worst
of
it
the
two
quarters
were
counterfeit
and
the
indian
told
him
so
but
he
said
no
i
stepped
to
the
door
and
watched
the
peon
go
to
a
grocer
store
across
the
street
they
refused
to
take
the
money
and
he
came
back
and
told
the
marble
dealer
upon
his
refusing
to
give
good
money
the
indian
turned
to
me
for
help
whereupon
the
keeper
laughed
and
said
she
is
a
yankee
and
ca
understand
you
well
i
had
not
been
in
mexico
long
and
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
language
but
my
american
love
for
justice
was
aroused
and
in
broken
english
and
bad
spanish
i
managed
to
tell
him
i
knew
the
money
was
bad
and
that
the
merchant
was
like
the
money
that
by
even
giving
good
money
he
was
cheating
the
poor
peon
of
his
goods
he
was
surprised
that
is
if
a
mexican
can
be
surprised
and
he
gave
out
some
little
change
which
i
examined
and
not
being
sure
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
put
it
into
my
own
purse
giving
the
man
a
quarter
instead
he
thanked
me
warmly
tied
the
money
up
in
the
corner
of
a
rag
he
had
tied
around
his
waist
and
then
went
out
and
tried
the
other
quarter
this
also
failed
to
pass
and
he
returned
to
the
now
furious
storeman
who
threatened
to
call
the
police
if
he
did
not
go
away
if
you
do
i
will
tell
them
that
you
are
passing
counterfeit
money
i
said
whereupon
he
gave
the
peon
another
piece
and
the
poor
fellow
departed
happy
while
the
storekeeper
said
some
nasty
things
in
spanish
about
gringos
it
is
needless
to
add
i
did
not
buy
nor
had
he
the
least
desire
to
sell
to
me
chapter
xxiv
a
few
notes
about
mexican
presidents
very
few
people
outside
of
the
republic
of
mexico
have
the
least
conception
of
how
government
affairs
are
run
there
the
inhabitants
of
mexico
at
least
it
is
so
estimated
number
souls
being
indians
uneducated
and
very
poor
this
large
majority
has
no
voice
in
any
matter
whatever
so
the
government
is
conducted
by
the
smaller
but
better
class
my
residence
in
mexico
of
five
months
did
not
give
me
ample
time
to
see
all
these
things
personally
but
i
have
the
very
best
authority
for
all
statements
men
whom
i
know
to
be
honorable
have
given
me
a
true
statement
of
facts
which
have
heretofore
never
reached
the
public
prints
that
such
things
missed
the
public
press
will
rather
astonish
americans
who
are
used
to
a
free
press
but
the
mexican
papers
never
publish
one
word
against
the
government
or
officials
and
the
people
who
are
at
their
mercy
dare
not
breathe
one
word
against
them
as
those
in
position
are
more
able
than
the
most
tyrannical
czar
to
make
their
life
miserable
when
this
is
finished
the
worst
is
yet
untold
by
half
so
the
reader
can
form
some
idea
about
the
government
of
mexico
president
diaz
according
to
all
versions
was
a
brave
and
untiring
soldier
who
fought
valiantly
for
his
beautiful
country
he
was
born
of
humble
parents
his
father
being
a
horse
dealer
or
something
of
that
sort
but
he
was
ambitions
and
gaining
an
education
entered
the
field
as
an
although
he
mastered
his
profession
all
his
fame
was
gained
on
the
battlefield
perfirio
diaz
is
undoubtedly
a
man
being
what
is
called
a
a
mixture
of
indian
and
spaniard
he
is
tall
and
finely
built
with
his
manners
are
polished
with
the
pleasing
spanish
style
compelling
one
to
think
while
in
his
presence
that
he
could
commit
no
wrong
the
brilliancy
of
his
eyes
and
hair
is
intensified
by
the
carmine
of
cheek
and
whiteness
of
brow
which
gossip
says
are
put
there
by
the
hand
of
art
diaz
has
been
married
twice
first
to
an
indian
woman
if
i
remember
rightly
who
left
him
with
one
child
and
next
to
a
daughter
of
the
present
secretary
of
the
interior
manuel
romero
rubio
she
is
handsome
of
the
spanish
type
a
good
many
years
younger
than
the
president
and
finely
educated
speaking
spanish
french
and
english
fluently
diaz
has
no
children
but
is
to
two
a
daughter
and
a
son
of
the
president
the
president
so
far
as
rumor
goes
follows
not
in
the
footsteps
of
his
countrymen
has
no
more
loves
than
one
and
is
really
devoted
to
diaz
there
are
two
political
parties
a
sort
of
a
liberal
and
conservative
concern
but
if
you
ask
almost
any
man
not
in
an
official
position
he
will
hesitate
and
then
explain
that
there
are
really
two
parties
that
he
has
almost
forgotten
their
names
but
he
has
never
voted
no
use
etc
juarez
who
crushed
maximilian
while
a
good
president
in
some
respects
planted
the
seeds
of
dishonesty
when
he
claimed
the
churches
and
pocketed
the
spoils
therefrom
every
president
since
then
has
done
what
he
could
to
excel
juarez
in
this
line
when
diaz
first
took
the
presidency
he
had
the
confidence
and
respect
of
the
people
for
his
former
conduct
they
expected
great
things
of
him
but
praise
in
a
short
time
was
given
less
and
less
freely
and
the
people
again
realized
that
their
savior
had
not
yet
been
found
when
his
term
drew
near
a
close
his
first
bite
made
him
long
for
more
and
he
made
a
contract
with
manuel
gonzales
to
give
him
the
presidency
if
he
would
return
it
at
the
end
of
his
time
as
the
laws
of
mexico
do
not
permit
a
president
to
be
his
own
successor
but
after
the
expiration
of
another
term
four
years
lie
can
again
fill
the
position
the
constitution
of
mexico
is
said
to
excel
in
the
way
of
freedom
and
liberty
to
its
subjects
that
of
the
united
states
but
it
is
only
on
paper
it
is
a
republic
only
in
name
being
in
reality
the
worst
monarchy
in
existence
its
subjects
know
nothing
of
the
delights
of
a
presidential
campaign
they
are
men
of
a
voting
age
but
they
have
never
indulged
in
this
manly
pursuit
which
even
our
women
are
hankering
after
no
two
candidates
are
nominated
for
the
position
but
the
organized
ring
allows
one
of
its
members
whoever
has
the
most
power
to
say
who
shall
be
president
they
can
vote
though
they
are
not
known
to
do
so
they
think
it
saves
trouble
time
and
expense
to
say
at
first
this
is
the
president
and
not
go
to
the
trouble
of
having
a
whole
nation
come
forward
and
cast
the
votes
and
keep
the
people
in
drunken
suspense
for
hours
while
the
managers
miscount
the
ballots
and
then
issue
bulletins
stating
that
they
have
put
in
their
man
then
the
president
names
all
the
governors
and
divides
with
them
the
naming
of
the
senators
this
is
the
ballot
in
mexico
senor
manuel
gonzales
readily
accepted
diaz
proposition
and
stepped
into
the
presidency
he
had
also
been
a
loyal
soldier
and
was
as
handsome
as
diaz
though
some
years
his
senior
gonzales
is
a
brave
man
powerfully
built
but
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
his
right
arm
in
battle
he
has
however
learned
to
write
with
his
left
in
a
large
scrawling
style
he
has
a
legal
wife
from
whom
however
he
is
separated
while
he
was
filling
the
presidential
chair
she
made
a
trip
through
the
united
states
and
gained
some
notoriety
by
being
put
out
of
the
palmer
house
because
she
did
not
pay
bills
contracted
there
on
the
strength
of
being
the
wife
of
the
president
of
mexico
on
her
return
to
the
land
of
the
aztecs
she
found
that
the
law
could
not
touch
the
czar
gonzales
who
was
living
like
a
king
nor
could
she
get
a
divorce
as
mexico
does
not
sanction
such
luxuries
she
started
a
sewing
establishment
but
it
is
said
that
she
is
living
in
abject
poverty
and
like
all
mexican
women
with
the
door
to
the
way
of
gaining
an
honest
livelihood
barred
against
her
because
of
her
sex
their
family
consists
of
two
sons
both
captains
in
the
army
manuel
years
old
and
fernando
and
well
educated
the
latter
is
said
to
be
quite
good
to
his
mother
it
is
reported
that
manuel
gonzales
and
miss
diaz
the
only
daughter
of
the
president
are
to
be
married
shortly
gonzales
while
in
power
issued
several
million
dollars
worth
of
nickel
money
which
the
people
refused
to
accept
one
day
as
he
was
being
driven
from
the
palace
in
an
open
carriage
he
was
surrounded
by
a
mob
who
threw
bags
of
the
coin
on
him
while
others
cried
out
for
his
life
the
driver
who
by
the
way
was
at
that
time
the
only
negro
in
the
city
of
mexico
fiercely
fought
those
who
had
stopped
his
team
and
resisted
by
main
force
their
efforts
to
unseat
him
he
wanted
to
drive
the
horses
right
over
the
angry
howling
mob
but
gonzales
calmly
told
him
to
desist
and
then
revolver
in
hand
descended
from
the
carriage
asked
the
people
what
they
wanted
swore
roundly
at
them
and
commanded
them
to
disperse
the
effect
was
astonishing
without
one
outburst
as
though
quelled
by
an
immense
army
that
maddened
mob
moved
away
and
gonzales
his
carriage
triumphantly
and
was
driven
home
unmolested
and
uninjured
the
money
however
was
sold
for
almost
nothing
and
some
europeans
were
smart
enough
to
buy
in
a
short
time
the
government
bought
it
all
back
paying
cent
for
cent
and
i
know
personally
one
man
who
made
in
one
day
on
his
lot
in
truth
it
was
the
foundation
of
more
than
twenty
fortunes
in
mexico
at
the
present
time
eight
months
before
gonzales
retired
he
tried
to
force
the
people
to
accept
the
english
debt
law
they
refused
and
filled
the
halls
of
congress
in
which
they
had
congregated
with
cries
and
groans
they
would
not
cease
at
the
presidential
command
and
gonzales
ordered
the
soldiers
to
fire
on
them
several
times
it
was
impossible
that
in
such
a
narrow
space
all
should
escape
death
yet
no
true
report
was
ever
made
of
the
affair
when
gonzales
went
into
office
could
be
counted
in
the
treasury
on
the
last
day
of
his
term
his
annual
income
exceeded
and
his
salary
which
was
yearly
on
the
morning
of
his
last
day
he
sent
to
the
treasurer
to
know
how
much
money
yet
remained
in
the
treasury
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
the
reply
gonzales
requested
that
it
be
sent
to
him
and
when
the
treasurer
meekly
hinted
that
it
might
be
good
for
his
neck
to
know
to
whom
to
charge
it
gonzales
replied
that
if
he
did
not
know
that
much
he
had
better
send
in
his
resignation
the
money
was
in
the
hand
in
a
very
short
time
after
this
next
he
bought
a
ticket
from
the
state
national
lottery
and
with
it
sent
a
little
line
to
the
managers
see
that
this
draws
the
prize
the
first
prize
was
strange
to
relate
his
ticket
drew
the
fortunate
number
and
gonzales
closed
his
eyes
that
night
with
a
murmur
like
as
he
gazed
upon
the
sea
the
world
is
mine
that
evening
the
people
were
so
glad
that
they
gathered
in
an
impassable
mob
around
the
palace
and
cathedral
and
tried
to
enter
the
latter
that
they
might
proclaim
their
feelings
by
ringing
forth
from
the
numerous
bells
which
hang
in
the
mammoth
towers
one
happy
peal
but
an
army
was
soon
on
the
spot
and
prevented
any
demonstration
investigation
showed
missing
and
the
government
employ√©s
unpaid
experts
figure
out
that
gonzales
raked
in
in
his
four
years
of
official
life
and
he
did
have
to
go
to
canada
either
gonzales
immediately
went
to
guanajuato
as
governor
where
he
was
received
with
open
arms
and
when
the
people
who
found
the
bank
broke
just
as
they
expected
to
take
it
began
to
whisper
that
they
would
like
a
little
investigation
gonzales
swore
he
would
spend
every
cent
they
were
clamoring
after
in
raising
an
army
to
overthrow
the
diaz
government
on
hearing
this
diaz
slunk
off
like
a
cat
and
made
a
law
which
went
into
effect
june
taking
a
percentage
off
every
government
employ√©
to
help
pay
up
the
gonzales
deficiency
gonzales
is
modest
he
do
want
the
presidency
any
more
he
wisely
invested
his
cash
in
an
estate
his
palaces
and
haciendas
are
something
wonderful
for
size
beauty
and
furnishment
of
course
give
a
man
a
bad
name
and
everything
mean
is
laid
at
his
door
but
it
is
credited
to
him
that
he
took
a
fancy
to
a
very
rich
hacienda
and
he
told
the
owner
he
would
give
him
the
haciendado
said
it
had
belonged
to
his
family
since
the
time
of
cortes
and
he
had
not
the
least
desire
to
sell
besides
it
was
at
the
very
least
worth
immediately
all
sorts
of
evil
fell
upon
the
unhappy
owner
his
horses
were
shot
his
cattle
water
and
even
family
poisoned
at
last
when
hope
was
crushed
gonzales
accidentally
reappeared
and
told
the
man
that
he
would
give
him
for
this
place
the
hacienda
was
immediately
his
but
the
former
owner
is
still
looking
for
his
money
the
strange
part
is
that
gonzales
has
not
suffered
the
afflictions
visited
upon
the
former
owner
president
diaz
has
two
years
from
next
december
to
serve
that
is
providing
a
revolution
does
not
cut
his
term
short
the
people
will
not
say
much
about
his
going
out
as
one
just
as
bad
will
replace
him
they
always
know
one
year
in
advance
who
the
president
is
to
be
and
even
at
the
present
date
it
lies
between
diaz
romerio
rubio
or
mier
teran
governor
of
oaxaca
both
of
whom
belong
to
the
ring
diaz
fears
a
revolution
and
is
afraid
of
losing
his
life
it
is
said
he
hastened
his
removal
to
chapultepec
because
they
threatened
to
blow
up
his
house
on
calle
de
cadena
no
with
dynamite
last
january
a
party
of
revolutionists
laid
plans
to
overthrow
the
diaz
government
but
one
fellow
got
into
a
controversy
with
a
diaz
party
while
riding
on
the
paseo
and
so
they
came
to
blows
the
news
got
abroad
and
armies
paraded
through
the
streets
of
mexico
until
the
poor
little
body
of
righters
were
overawed
by
the
demonstration
gonzales
is
years
old
he
gets
along
nicely
as
governor
of
guanajuato
having
no
duties
and
being
looked
up
to
as
a
king
by
the
people
when
he
comes
to
mexico
for
a
few
days
they
prepare
expensive
receptions
for
his
return
they
are
his
humble
subjects
and
he
is
satisfied
to
be
king
of
that
state
chapter
xxv
mexican
soldiers
and
the
rurales
el
mexicano
thinks
it
would
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
as
well
as
one
of
the
easiest
things
in
the
world
to
whip
the
gringoes
while
the
latter
with
their
heads
a
little
swelled
perhaps
imagine
otherwise
and
scoff
at
the
idea
of
the
greasers
winning
even
one
battle
in
the
event
of
war
be
that
as
it
may
solid
unvarnished
facts
will
prove
to
the
most
headstrong
that
the
advantage
is
mostly
on
the
other
side
the
standing
army
in
mexico
is
said
to
number
forty
thousand
men
but
is
believed
to
be
more
every
little
village
of
a
few
hundred
people
has
its
army
and
every
day
that
army
is
being
increased
the
officers
range
from
those
who
have
gained
experience
and
fame
on
the
battlefield
to
the
young
ones
reared
and
trained
in
military
colleges
they
are
mostly
all
of
what
is
considered
the
highest
class
of
people
in
mexico
the
rank
and
file
are
mostly
or
indians
who
are
not
by
any
means
volunteers
they
are
nearly
all
convicts
when
a
man
is
convicted
of
some
misdemeanor
he
is
enlisted
in
the
regular
army
separated
from
his
home
and
to
serve
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
this
life
is
not
a
bed
of
roses
there
is
no
bed
at
all
and
out
of
a
medio
cents
a
day
he
has
to
furnish
his
food
and
comforts
the
dress
uniform
is
made
of
coarse
woolen
goods
with
yellow
stripes
on
the
sleeves
and
the
undress
uniform
which
is
worn
constantly
except
on
review
days
is
but
white
muslin
pants
waist
and
cap
some
of
the
indians
are
stolen
and
put
in
the
army
and
they
immediately
resign
themselves
to
their
fate
for
there
is
no
more
escape
for
them
than
there
is
from
death
the
wives
of
these
poor
fellows
are
very
faithful
and
very
often
follow
the
regiment
from
one
place
to
another
they
live
on
what
nature
grows
for
them
and
what
they
can
beg
or
steal
the
men
are
called
in
spanish
soldados
and
the
women
because
they
cling
to
their
husbands
soldadas
it
looks
very
pitiful
to
see
a
poor
indian
woman
with
a
babe
tied
to
her
back
and
one
clinging
to
her
skirts
dusty
hungry
and
footsore
traveling
for
miles
through
the
hot
sun
with
the
regiments
these
soldados
are
wonderfully
hardy
they
can
travel
for
a
week
through
the
hot
sun
with
nothing
to
drink
and
but
a
spoonful
of
boiled
beans
and
one
tortillia
a
small
flat
cake
for
two
rations
sleep
on
the
ground
at
night
and
be
us
fresh
for
service
as
a
mule
fight
well
those
who
imagine
it
such
an
easy
thing
to
whip
them
should
stand
off
and
witness
some
of
their
feats
first
they
love
their
country
and
consider
life
well
lost
in
defense
of
it
they
are
ignorant
it
is
true
but
seem
the
more
courageous
for
it
when
told
to
fight
they
go
at
it
with
as
much
vigor
as
a
bull
dog
after
a
cat
they
do
know
why
they
are
fighting
or
for
what
but
it
is
their
rule
and
custom
to
obey
not
to
reason
why
if
you
would
stop
one
soldier
in
the
midst
of
his
fighting
and
ask
why
are
you
fighting
he
would
answer
in
the
characteristic
words
of
his
people
quien
sabe
if
a
man
is
silly
enough
to
try
to
escape
from
this
bondage
he
is
immediately
shot
or
if
he
disobeys
orders
they
have
time
but
to
punish
him
with
death
a
short
time
before
leaving
mexico
some
guards
at
the
prison
tried
to
desert
and
immediately
every
regiment
was
notified
to
be
on
the
lookout
and
others
were
sent
out
to
recapture
them
and
as
soon
as
found
they
were
shot
the
soldiers
have
an
herb
named
marijuana
which
they
roll
into
small
cigaros
and
smoke
it
produces
intoxication
which
lasts
for
five
days
and
for
that
period
they
are
in
paradise
it
has
no
ill
yet
the
use
is
forbidden
by
law
it
is
commonly
used
among
prisoners
one
cigaro
is
made
and
the
prisoners
all
sitting
in
a
ring
partake
of
it
the
smoker
takes
a
draw
and
blows
the
smoke
into
the
mouth
of
the
nearest
man
he
likewise
gives
it
to
another
and
so
on
around
the
circle
one
cigaro
will
intoxicate
the
whole
lot
for
the
length
of
five
days
the
mexican
officers
are
unpleasantly
sarcastic
or
rather
they
have
a
custom
that
is
the
extreme
of
irony
it
is
known
as
la
ley
fuga
the
law
of
escape
they
will
tell
you
they
are
going
to
take
a
prisoner
or
soldier
as
the
case
may
be
out
to
the
suburbs
to
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
it
sounds
very
pleasant
to
the
stranger
they
will
for
example
politely
ask
the
railway
conductor
to
stop
the
train
in
some
quiet
place
as
they
want
to
let
a
prisoner
escape
the
american
conductor
finds
his
heart
warming
within
him
for
these
generous
officers
and
quickly
and
gladly
obeys
the
train
is
stopped
they
all
get
off
and
the
officers
form
in
a
single
line
with
guns
raised
to
the
shoulders
the
prisoner
is
placed
before
them
and
told
to
he
gives
one
glance
into
their
unchanging
faces
the
surrounding
land
and
then
starts
that
moment
he
falls
to
the
earth
riddled
with
a
dozen
bullets
and
the
executioners
the
train
and
are
speeding
fast
away
almost
before
the
echo
of
this
fatal
volley
died
away
they
can
not
waste
time
putting
his
body
beneath
the
ground
but
before
long
some
indians
traveling
that
way
find
it
he
is
one
of
them
and
their
turn
may
be
next
so
they
lay
him
in
a
hole
erect
a
wooden
cross
at
the
end
murmur
a
prayer
and
leave
him
to
return
to
that
from
which
he
sprung
this
is
the
merciful
law
of
escape
practiced
daily
in
mexico
once
every
year
to
commemorate
the
victory
over
the
french
on
the
of
may
the
president
reviews
all
the
troops
they
flock
to
the
city
from
mountain
valley
town
and
city
clad
in
holiday
attire
then
only
one
realizes
their
strength
as
they
march
before
the
palace
where
the
president
is
seated
on
the
balcony
the
finest
looking
men
in
the
whole
are
the
rurales
they
number
and
are
larger
men
than
mexicans
usually
are
these
rurales
are
a
band
of
outlaws
who
came
forward
with
their
chief
and
aided
diaz
during
the
war
when
it
was
over
diaz
recognized
their
power
and
was
so
afraid
of
them
that
he
offered
them
a
place
in
the
army
with
their
chief
as
general
and
they
are
not
only
the
best
paid
but
speaking
of
their
fighting
ability
the
best
men
in
mexico
in
the
first
place
they
are
large
and
powerful
and
known
over
the
entire
country
mountain
town
and
valley
as
thoroughly
as
we
know
our
a
b
they
fear
nothing
on
earth
or
out
of
it
and
will
fight
on
the
least
provocation
they
would
rather
fight
than
eat
and
have
a
great
aversion
to
exhibiting
themselves
as
they
demonstrated
on
the
of
may
last
when
only
could
be
persuaded
to
participate
they
have
their
own
bands
and
a
number
of
buglers
every
man
owns
his
horse
which
must
in
color
match
that
of
the
rest
of
the
regiment
their
uniform
is

with
silver
and
gold
upon
the
pants
and
on
the
back
front
and
sleeves
of
the
short
cutaway
jacket
their
wide
sombrero
is
the
same
color
finished
with
the
same
embroidery
and
a
silver
cord
and
tassel
their
saddles
also
match
their
suits
in
color
and
silver
finish
how
they
ride
it
is
simply
perfection
the
horse
and
rider
seem
to
be
one
i
do
think
they
could
carry
any
more
weapons
if
they
tried
each
man
has
a
good
carbine
a
sword
two
revolvers
the
same
number
of
daggers
and
two
lassos
and
they
fight
with
any
or
all
of
these
weapons
they
fight
very
cleverly
with
the
lasso
if
they
wish
to
take
a
prisoner
a
very
unusual
proceeding
on
their
part
they
with
the
rope
can
either
lasso
man
and
horse
together
or
two
or
more
men
the
other
lasso
is
of
wire
which
not
only
catches
the
fugitive
but
knocks
him
senseless
or
cuts
his
head
off
as
the
case
may
be
these
rurales
guide
tourists
through
the
interior
and
also
attend
all
public
places
to
keep
order
they
receive
one
dollar
a
day
which
is
enormous
compared
with
the
other
soldiers
pay
of
six
and
cents
they
have
their
horses
in
perfect
control
and
can
make
them
execute
all
kinds
of
movements
in
a
body
while
the
tricks
performed
by
individual
horses
are
numberless
the
mexicans
have
a
good
deal
of
suppressed
wrath
bothering
them
at
the
present
day
they
know
that
diaz
is
a
tyrannical
czar
and
want
to
overthrow
him
it
may
be
readily
believed
that
diaz
knows
they
are
bound
to
get
rid
of
this
superfluous
feeling
and
he
would
much
rather
have
them
vent
its
strength
on
the
americans
than
on
himself
thus
he
stands
on
the
war
question
he
is
a
good
general
and
has
many
good
tough
old
soldiers
the
best
of
whom
is
gonzales
to
aid
him

chapter
xxvi
the
press
of
mexico
the
press
of
mexico
is
like
any
of
the
other
subjects
of
that
monarchy
yet
it
is
a
growing
surprise
to
the
american
used
to
free
movement
speech
and
print
who
visits
mexico
with
the
attained
idea
that
it
is
a
republic
even
our
newspapers
have
been
wont
to
clip
from
the
little
sheets
which
issue
from
that
country
believing
them
untrammeled
and
quoting
them
as
the
best
authority
when
in
truth
they
are
but
tools
of
the
organized
ring
and
are
only
capable
of
deceiving
the
outsider
in
the
city
of
mexico
there
are
about
newspapers
published
and
throughout
the
empire
some
few
which
are
perused
by
the
smallest
possible
number
of
people
the
mexicans
understand
thoroughly
how
the
papers
are
run
and
they
consequently
have
not
the
slightest
respect
in
the
world
for
them
one
can
travel
for
miles
or
by
the
day
and
never
see
a
man
with
a
newspaper
they
possess
such
a
disgust
for
newspapers
that
they
will
not
even
use
one
of
them
as
a
subterfuge
to
hide
behind
in
a
street
car
when
some
woman
with
a
dozen
bundles
three
children
and
two
baskets
is
looking
for
a
seat
the
best
paper
in
mexico
is
monitor
the
republican
monitor
which
claims
to
have
in
the
city
suburbs
and
united
states
a
circulation
of
five
thousand
it
is
printed
entirely
in
spanish
the
is
a
weekly
paper
filled
with
advertisements
from
the
states
which
is
published
in
english
and
spanish
and
is
bought
only
by
those
who
want
to
learn
the
spanish
language
yet
it
is
the
best
english
paper
in
mexico
another
english
paper
is
published
by
an
american
howell
hunt
in
zacatecas
but
it
like
the
rest
is
of
little
or
no
account
one
of
the
newsiest
if
not
the
newsiest
is
the
times
which
is
squelched
about
every
fortnight
as
it
is
very
few
have
telegraphic
communication
with
the
outside
world
and
none
whatever
with
their
own
country
they
mostly
clip
and
translate
items
from
their
exchanges
heading
them
special
telegrams
when
in
reality
they
are
from
eight
to
ten
days
old
monitor
steals
from
its
exchanges
first
and
the
other
papers
copy
from
it
not
a
single
paper
has
a
reporter
two
men
are
considered
plenty
to
clip
and
translate
for
a
daily
and
it
is
not
unusual
for
them
to
borrow
type
to
set
the
paper
all
the
is
done
in
the
daytime
and
a
morning
paper
is
ready
for
sale
if
anybody
wanted
it
the
afternoon
before
while
our
morning
newspapers
allow
their
brains
to
rest
at
the
mexican
brethren
cease
labor
the
day
before
at
things
happening
on
the
streets
which
would
make
a
display
head
with
us
are
never
even
mentioned
by
them
one
day
i
saw
a
woman
fall
dead
two
squares
away
from
a
newspaper
office
and
after
a
long
time
read
in
the
same
paper
one
of
our
respected
contemporaries
is
authority
for
the
story
than
an
unknown
indian
woman
dropped
dead
on
the
street
about
two
weeks
ago
it
needed
no
label
castanado
chestnut
for
a
time
the
papers
imagined
they
had
an
item
there
was
an
old
frenchman
who
made
some
sort
of
taffy
and
with
it
used
to
perambulate
the
streets
crying
piruli
the
english
paper
came
out
quoting
a
notice
of
this
old
fellow
in
a
few
days
they
quoted
another
to
the
effect
that
the
old
fellow
had
died
of
smallpox
then
after
using
space
for
one
entire
week
changing
every
other
day
the
cause
of
the
old
man
death
and
substituting
some
new
disease
the
learned
editor
stated
that
according
to
all
reports
the
old
fellow
was
not
dead
at
all
but
had
charmed
some
rich
mexican
widow
with
his
musical
voice
or
taffy
and
was
enjoying
a
honeymoon
on
her
bank
account
we
even
did
not
get
peace
with
that
but
in
a
few
days
they
declared
the
report
false
and
gave
a
new
version
when
we
left
there
five
months
later
they
were
still
contradicting
themselves
about
the
old
quite
as
bad
was
their
treatment
of
a
small
forest
fire
located
about
twenty
miles
from
the
city
i
was
at
the
village
at
the
time
and
was
quite
amused
when
the
fires
were
extinguished
after
eight
burning
to
read
for
two
weeks
after
contradictory
stories
on
it
it
was
still
raging
with
renewed
energy
hundreds
of
lives
had
been
lost
until
one
morning
the
english
paper
said
according
to
a
letter
received
at
this
office
yesterday
the
forest
fire
only
lasted
a
few
hours
and
our
contemporaries
from
whom
we
have
been
quoting
have
made
a
big
mistake
no
lives
were
lost
when
a
new
member
was
added
to
the
royal
family
of
spain
the
notice
was
clipped
from
a
foreign
paper
in
which
it
stated
clearly
that
the
queen
regent
christina
had
given
birth
to
a
boy
baby
yet
it
was
headed
is
it
a
boy
when
it
grew
a
little
colder
than
usual
in
an
interior
town
they
headed
the
item
a
mexican
town
in
danger
when
roswell
flower
of
new
york
returned
from
his
trip
to
mexico
he
was
interviewed
by
some
reporter
and
while
he
said
nothing
in
favor
he
said
nothing
against
it
so
they
headed
the
clipping
he
loves
mexico
moralizing
is
quite
customary
at
least
with
the
english
paper
after
quoting
an
item
from
about
a
married
pair
quarreling
go
fiercely
that
the
took
bilious
fever
and
died
it
gave
a
sermon
entitled
let
not
your
angry
passions
rise
on
another
occasion
speaking
of
the
criminal
list
being
unusually
large
for
the
last
month
it
broke
out
with
oh
pulque
pulque
what
evils
are
committed
under
thine
influence
and
yet
verily
thou
art
a
most
excellent
aid
to
digestion
all
the
papers
which
i
know
of
are
subsidized
by
the
government
and
until
within
several
months
ago
they
were
paid
to
abstain
from
attacks
on
the
government
this
subsidy
has
stopped
through
want
of
funds
but
the
papers
say
nothing
against
the
government
as
they
care
too
much
for
their
easy
lives
so
they
circulate
among
foreigners
misrepresenting
all
mexican
affairs
and
putting
everything
in
a
fair
but
utterly
false
light
the
mexicans
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
papers
and
the
newspaper
men
have
no
standing
whatever
not
even
level
with
the
government
officials
whose
tools
they
are
if
a
newspaper
even
hints
that
government
affairs
could
be
bettered
the
editors
are
thrown
into
prison
too
filthy
for
brutes
until
they
die
or
swear
never
to
repeat
the
offense
the
papers
containing
the
libelous
items
are
all
hunted
up
by
the
police
and
destroyed
and
the
office
and
type
are
destroyed
these
arrests
are
not
unusual
indeed
they
are
of
frequent
occurrence
while
in
mexico
i
knew
of
at
least
one
man
being
sent
to
jail
every
two
weeks
they
are
taken
by
force
in
the
most
peculiar
manner
for
a
country
which
lays
claim
to
having
laws
not
to
speak
of
being
a
republic
just
for
an
imaginary
offense
in
their
writings
they
are
remanded
to
prison
and
are
kept
in
dark
and
dirty
cells
shut
off
from
connection
with
the
world
without
trial
without
even
enough
to
eat
a
satirical
paper
named
was
denounced
by
some
offended
government
officials
and
the
editor
was
thrown
into
jail
then
daniel
cabrera
started
another
mexican
puck
and
called
it
del
the
son
of
ahuizote
it
was
quite
clever
and
got
out
a
caricature
entitled
the
cemetery
of
the
press
showing
in
the
background
the
graves
of
the
different
papers
and
in
the
front
a
large
cross
engraved
the
independent
press
while
hanging
to
each
side
was
a
owl
with
a
spade
on
top
of
the
tomb
was
a
lighted
fuse
marked
liberty
underneath
it
read
the
sad
cemetery
of
the
press
of
mexico
filled
by
liberty
leaders
juarez
lerdo
diaz
and
gonzales
the
police
were
sent
out
to
gather
up
and
destroy
every
copy
of
this
paper
editor
cabrera
was
put
in
belem
where
he
remained
in
the
most
pitiable
condition
until
death
promised
release
through
the
influence
of
friends
they
took
him
home
to
die
guarding
his
house
with
a
regiment
until
he
should
be
fit
to
be
carried
back
to
jail
or
until
they
should
see
his
body
consigned
to
the
grave
to
say
libelous
things
is
as
dangerous
as
to
write
them
one
fellow
who
ran
a
liquor
shop
let
his
tongue
wag
too
much
for
wisdom
and
one
night
a
member
of
the
police
secret
service
went
in
and
as
the
proprietor
turned
to
get
the
drink
the
policeman
had
called
for
he
was
shot
in
the
back
and
again
in
the
body
after
he
had
fallen
the
notice
of
the
affair
ended
by
saying
it
is
not
known
whether
the
policeman
had
orders
to
do
the
shooting
cronicade
the
chronicle
editor
was
denounced
and
imprisoned
for
simply
speaking
about
the
rulings
of
one
of
the
judges
as
all
know
by
the
editor
cutting
case
even
a
foreigner
does
not
write
about
mexico
doings
as
they
really
are
i
had
some
regard
for
my
health
and
a
mexican
jail
is
the
least
desirable
abode
on
the
face
of
the
earth
so
some
care
was
exercised
in
the
selection
of
topics
while
we
were
inside
their
gates
quite
innocently
one
day
i
wrote
a
short
notice
about
some
editors
who
received
no
pay
from
the
government
being
put
in
jail
the
article
was
copied
from
one
paper
to
another
and
finally
reached
mexico
the
subsidized
sheets
threatened
to
denounce
me
and
said
in
spanish
one
button
was
enough
meaning
by
one
article
the
officials
could
see
what
my
others
were
like
but
by
means
of
a
little
bravado
i
convinced
them
that
i
had
the
upper
hand
and
they
left
me
unhurt
they
have
a
law
known
as
article
which
defines
the
fate
of
pernicious
foreigners
who
speak
or
write
too
freely
of
the
land
and
its
inhabitants
once
or
twice
they
have
been
kind
enough
to
take
the
offending
foreigner
and
march
him
with
a
regiment
of
soldiers
at
his
heels
across
the
boundary
line
professor
francis
wayland
of
brown
university
together
with
the
american
consul
porch
and
parsons
visited
the
prison
belem
to
ascertain
the
conditions
of
the
editors
imprisoned
there
they
were
not
granted
any
of
the
customary
privileges
but
one
little
paid
sheet
was
afraid
some
truth
would
reach
the
public
eye
as
professor
wayland
was
soon
to
return
to
the
states
in
referring
to
the
visit
this
paper
said
it
is
to
be
noted
that
these
men
wanted
to
enter
the
very
gallery
where
the
newspaper
men
were
confined
and
that
they
took
in
a
memorandum
book
of
all
answers
to
save
trouble
parsons
who
resides
in
mexico
said
they
merely
exchanged
the
usual
greeting
with
the
prisoners
some
of
the
editors
confined
thought
that
as
they
belonged
to
a
press
club
that
they
could
appeal
to
the
associated
press
of
the
united
states
for
aid
of
course
such
an
appeal
would
be
useless
the
papers
now
published
there
take
pride
in
copying
and
crediting
them
to
other
papers
no
dependence
can
be
put
in
any
of
them
for
a
true
statement
of
affairs
the

and
run
by
a
texan
major

lived
in
mexico
with
his
family
and
regularly
every
evening
used
to
take
a
walk
down
the
paseo
with
his
two
daughters
who
always
walked
a
couple
of
yards
in
advance
this
was
repeated
every
day
until
the
mexicans
used
to
say
there
is

able
to
translate

there
is
nothing
that
will
amuse
a
tourist
more
in
the
city
of
mexico
than
reading
the
street
and
store
signs
and
names
of
the
different
squares
streets
are
not
named
there
as
here
every
square
is
called
a
street
and
has
a
separate
name
the
same
with
all
the
stores
and
public
buildings
no
difference
how
small
they
have
some
long
fantastic
name
painted
above

we
used
to
get
lunch
at
a
restaurant
called
the
coffee
house

bought
her

were
all

of

to
they
never

to
their

if
none
will
fit
they
make
to
order
without
extra
charges
there
is
not

in

they
can
not

sold
one

on
a
prominent

attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
ridicule
the
mexican
women
have
lovely
feet
and
their
shoes
are
very
fancy
extremely
high
cut
french
or
opera
heels
and
pointed
toes
the
shoemakers
have
a
book
in
which
they
take
orders
for
shoes
first
they
set
the
foot
down
on
a
clean
page
and
mark
out
the
exact
size
then
they
write
on
it
the
measure
and
the
thickness
and
when
the
shoe
arrives
it
is
of
perfect
fit
let
it
be
added
as
encouragement
to
that
although
the
foot
is
exquisite
in
size
and
shape
she
walks
with
a
decided
stoop
caused
by
the
extremely
high
heels
she
has
worn
from
babyhood

from
telling

equally

there
are
eleven
streets
named
after
humboldt
in
the
city
of
mexico
curious
legends
are
attached
to
many
of
the
streets
but
many
have
been
forgotten
the
street
which
faces
the
national
palace
called
don
juan
manuel
is
very
interesting
from
its
story
which
they
say
is
every
word
true
as
we
have
no
power
with
which
to
test
its
veracity
it
must
pass
without
questioning
here
it
is
when
the
spaniards
first
settled
in
mexico
there
was
one
man
named
don
juan
manuel
who
although
blessed
with
a
handsome
wife
was
always
discontented
and
complaining
because
his
family
did
not
increase
this
melancholy
affected
his
digestive
organs
until
he
became
a
victim
of
dyspepsia
which
we
all
know
leads
to
various
whims
and
fancies
at
any
rate
ho
became
possessed
of
the
idea
that
his
wife
was
unfaithful
to
his
fitful
and
fretful
devotion
and
he
sat
up
at
night
brooding
over
this
and
writing
down
beautiful
names
he
would
hear
and
read
of
that
would
be
handy
in
case
of
any
sudden
and
unexpected
event
whereby
they
could
be
utilized
one
night
while
thus
occupied
the
devil
appeared
and
told
him
to
bring
his
nephew
from
spain
and
also
to
stand
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cape
such
as
is
yet
worn
by
his
countrymen
in
front
of
his
house
at
eleven
that
night
a
very
late
hour
for
a
spaniard
to
be
abroad
in
mexico
the
first
man
who
passed
would
be
the
one
who
had
stolen
his
wife
love
whispered
the
devil
and
don
juan
manuel
must
say
to
him
my
friend
what
is
the
hour
and
on
the
man
replying
continue
you
are
a
happy
man
you
know
the
hour
of
your
death
then
stab
him
to
the
heart
this
done
he
was
to
immediately
feel
relieved
his
wife
love
would
return
and
he
would
ever
after
be
supremely
happy
the
don
much
elated
at
the
promised
downfall
of
an
imaginary
rival
and
the
ease
it
would
bring
to
his
worried
mind
hastened
to
do
the
devil
bidding
the
very
next
night
wrapped
in
his
long
cloak
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
his
house
just
as
the
watchman
whistle
calling
the
hour
of
eleven
had
ceased
to
sound
way
off
in
the
distance
a
man
as
the
devil
predicted
came
walking
by
my
friend
what
is
the
hour
cried
don
juan
manuel
true
to
the
historic
courtesy
of
his
birth
the
stranger
politely
stopped
and
replied
with
your
permission
eleven
senor
don
you
are
a
happy
man
you
know
the
hour
of
your
death
and
the
unsuspecting
stranger
fell
stabbed
to
the
heart
while
don
manuel
hastened
into
his
casa
but
he
found
no
relief
while
he
had
no
regret
for
the
deed
his
jealousy
seemed
to
burn
with
increased
fire
so
the
devil
came
again
and
told
him
he
had
killed
the
wrong
man
but
he
must
persevere
go
out
again
kill
the
man
that
he
should
see
at
that
hour
and
at
last
he
would
find
the
right
one
the
people
began
to
talk
about
a
man
being
found
every
morning
dead
at
the
same
spot
and
in
the
same
manner
but
don
juan
was
one
of
their
highest
by
birth
and
rearing
and
was
above
suspicion
their
superstition
made
them
attribute
the
deaths
to
an
invisible
power
and
no
investigation
was
made
in
the
meantime
don
juan
dearly
beloved
nephew
had
arrived
from
spain
and
was
not
only
warmly
welcomed
by
him
but
by
his
wife
who
hoped
the
nephew
might
be
the
means
of
helping
to
bridge
the
chasm
which
for
months
had
steadily
been
increasing
between
herself
and
her
husband
night
came
on
and
the
don
went
out
to
perform
his
deadly
business
a
man
clad
like
himself
came
along
and
don
juan
approached
with
my
friend
what
is
the
hour
eleven
adois
briefly
answered
the
one
addressed
you
are
a
happy
man
you
know
the
hour
of
your
death
and
the
stranger
sank
with
a
slight
moan
while
the
don
fled
to
his
dreary
chambers
morning
dawned
and
a
dead
man
as
usual
was
found
don
manuel
met
them
carrying
the
body
into
his
casa
heard
the
screams
of
his
wife
and
saw
the
rigid
face
of
his
beloved
nephew
dead
and
by
his
hand
he
rushed
to
his
father
confessor
whom
he
had
not
visited
for
so
long
and
begged
absolution
thou
must
first
repent
said
the
father
repent
repent
cried
the
wretched
man
i
am
racked
with
misery
grant
me
absolution
prove
thy
repentance
first
answered
the
father
go
and
stand
beneath
the
scaffolding
in
front
of
the
official
building
when
the
bell
and
watchman
tolls
the
hour
for
midnight
prove
thy
repentance
by
doing
that
thrice
then
come
to
me
after
the
first
trial
he
returned
to
the
father
begging
that
absolution
be
granted
for
devils
had
wounded
his
flesh
and
tortured
him
as
he
had
stood
beneath
the
scaffolding
no
twice
more
must
thou
stand
there
was
the
unrelenting
reply
and
once
again
he
went
morning
brought
him
more
dead
than
alive
to
the
good
father
side
his
face
wore
the
hue
of
death
his
form
was
trembling
his
eyes
were
glassy
and
his
words
wild
i
can
not
endure
the
third
night
angels
and
devils
alike
surround
me
my
victims
ask
me
with
their
cold
hands
about
my
throat
and
glassy
eyes
staring
into
mine
to
name
the
hour
i
want
to
die
my
flesh
is
bruised
where
they
burn
and
prick
me
my
head
is
sore
from
the
frequent
pulling
of
my
hair
grant
me
absolution
they
have
showed
me
the
bottomless
pit
of
hell
and
i
can
not
return
the
good
father
prayed
long
and
earnestly
with
him
that
the
almighty
power
would
deal
leniently
with
his
many
crimes
but
commanded
the
trembling
wretch
to
spend
the
third
and
final
night
beneath
the
scaffolding
dawn
came
but
it
brought
no
hopeful
man
for
the
promised
absolution
they
found
him
hanging
on
the
scaffolding
dead
some
say
the
angels
took
him
away
because
he
had
suffered
sufficiently
for
his
sins
others
say
the
devils
hung
him
because
he
tried
to
escape
the
toil
he
had
willingly
accepted
but
he
was
dead
his
story
was
made
known
and
because
of
the
strangeness
of
it
this
street
was
named
after
him
and
i
never
traversed
it
while
in
mexico
but
that
i
felt
sorrow
for
the
poor
insane
wretch
as
he
stood
three
nights
beneath
the
scaffolding

chapter
xxviii
a
mexican
parlor
most
readers
will
probably
be
interested
to
know
how
custom
rules
that
a
parlor
shall
be
furnished
in
spanish
as
we
quaintly
say
in
mexico
for
the
knowledge
that
all
are
of
a
different
tongue
makes
a
rather
queer
impression
and
it
is
quite
common
for
foreigners
to
remark
oh
they
ca
hear
they
are
spanish
we
even
get
to
think
they
can
not
see
and
that
people
laugh
and
babies
cry
in
spanish
a
parlor
or
is
found
in
every
private
mexican
house
but
until
within
the
last
two
years
there
was
not
a
hotel
in
the
republic
that
had
a
parlor
boarders
entertained
their
friends
in
their
bedrooms
and
this
is
yet
considered
quite
the
proper
thing
to
do
some
of
the
hotels
now
advertise
as
on
the
strength
of
having
a
little
parlor
calling
or
visiting
is
quite
uncommon
as
there
is
no
society
and
little
sociability
outside
their
home
doors
yet
occasionally
relatives
call
on
one
another
still
i
have
been
with
cousins
who
accidentally
met
at
church
and
though
they
were
the
best
of
friends
living
within
a
dozen
squares
of
each
other
they
had
not
exchanged
visits
for
three
years
this
is
quite
common
i
know
two
sisters
living
within
four
squares
of
each
other
who
have
not
been
in
each
house
for
a
year
i
hardly
think
the
reason
is
a
lack
of
sociability
or
hospitality
as
once
within
the
massive
walls
of
their
the
spanish
courtesy
is
readily
exhibited
they
are
your
servants
and
their
house
is
yours
for
the
time
being
but
the
main
causes
are
the
gradual
decrease
of
their
once
princely
fortunes
and
their
laziness
the
latter
i
regard
from
close
observation
as
the
chief
fault
yet
with
all
their
retired
habits
they
retain
the
custom
of
former
generations
as
to
how
their
parlor
must
be
arranged
and
visits
paid
and
received
as
strictly
us
though
they
were
in
the
midst
of
an
ultra
society
circle
their
customs
i
have
been
informed
are
thoroughly
spanish
and
are
the
only
ones
practiced
both
in
spain
and
cuba
the
is
always
on
the
second
floor
as
none
but
servants
occupy
the
ground
or
first
floor
and
it
is
generally
the
only
room
in
the
house
which
boasts
of
a
carpet
in
several
cases
i
have
seen
the
floors
made
of
polished
wood
and
marble
tiling
the
walls
are
beautifully
frescoed
in
colors
and
the
ceiling
which
is
always
very
high
has
a
magnificent
painting
in
the
center
the
subject
invariably
of
angels
or
a
group
of
females
in
each
corner
there
are
round
openings
of
about
ten
inches
in
circumference
which
serve
as
ventilators
and
very
often
a
double
purpose
by
letting
scorpions
in
on
unwilling
victims
the
windows
are
but
glass
doors
opening
out
upon
little
balconies
shaded
by
awnings
each
is
transparent
and
as
the
light
shines
through
it
not
only
fills
the
room
with
some
beautiful
delicate
tints
but
discloses
a
lovely
southern
scene
cobweby
curtains
of
creamy
white
hang
from
brass
poles
suspended
at
least
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
window
forming
in
themselves
little
nooks
which
would
be
idolized
by
romantically
inclined
spoons
and
spooners
of
the
states
the
mexicans
are
all
good
judges
of
paintings
and
many
are
talented
artists
they
do
not
harrow
up
one
sensibilities
with
dollar
daubs
of
skies
and
a
mammoth
animal
with
horns
and
tail
standing
on
a
white
streak
in
the
foreground
which
the
animal
placed
could
stand
on
all
fours
and
never
touch
water
nor
does
one
eyes
have
to
long
for
the
waters
of
lethe
because
of
tea
prizes
and
mikado
ornaments
but
a
selection
of
good
oil
paintings
and
mirrors
all
framed
in
brass
grace
their
rooms
the
piano
is
almost
universal
and
occupies
some
nook
by
itself
the
furniture
for
the
is
always
cushioned
and
is
composed
mainly
of
easy
chairs
the
sofa
the
seat
of
honor
is
placed
against
the
wall
beneath
some
large
painting
or
mirror
and
a
large
rug
is
laid
in
front
starting
from
either
end
are
the
easy
chairs
which
form
an
unbroken
circle
around
the
sofa
all
thus
being
able
to
face
it
without
turning
their
backs
on
any
one
directly
at
the
back
of
the
chairs
or
facing
the
sofa
is
a
round
table
with
a
crazy
patchwork
cover
which
craze
has
invaded
even
that
country
or
a
knitted
scarf
then
it
is
actually
littered
with
ornaments
of
every
description
leaving
no
empty
space
as
an
englishman
rather
tersely
remarked
to
me
they
look
like
a
counter
in
a
crowded
pawn
shop
all
the
chairs
and
the
sofa
have
crocheted
tidies
on
the
backs
arms
and
seat
each
separate
and
enough
to
madden
a
talmage
convert
you
may
rise
up
slowly
with
an
andersonian
grace
and
first
one
female
politely
begs
permission
to
remove
one
of
her
tidies
from
your
hat
then
they
will
file
into
the
next
room
one
by
one
to
see
how
sombrero
becomes
them
while
another
removes
a
white
delicately
constructed
thing
from
your
tournure
what
they
dote
on
which
latter
they
have
been
dying
to
closely
inspect
and
to
find
how
you
manage
to
have
it
hang
so
prettily
and
after
you
remove
another
tidy
which
has
become
fastened
to
your
heel
although
you
ca
imagine
how
you
detach
yet
another
from
the
side
trimmings
of
your
dress
by
that
time
you
are
flustered
forget
the
andersonian
grace
and
utter
some
emphatic
words
about
tidies
and
tidy
matters
in
general
and
sit
down
with
a
real
castletonian
kick
the
is
not
complete
without
at
least
two
cabinets
to
hold
the
overflow
of
the
center
table
in
all
the
odd
corners
are
pedestals
on
which
are
statuettes
in
marble
bronze
or
just
as
the
owner
purse
permits
tropical
plants
in
quaint
jars
of
indian
design
and
construction
and
rustic
stands
are
grouped
about
and
parrots
and
birds
of
high
and
low
voices
complete
the
attractions
of
the
beautiful
mexican
chapter
xxix
love
and
courtship
in
mexico
why
the
world
are
all
thinking
about
it
and
as
for
myself
i
can
swear
if
i
fancied
that
heaven
were
without
it
i
scarce
feel
a
wish
to
be
there
beneath
the
mexican
skies
where
everybody
treats
life
as
if
it
were
one
long
holiday
they
love
with
a
passion
as
fervent
as
their
southern
sun
but
on
one
side
at
least
as
brilliant
and
transient
as
a
shooting
star
yet
there
is
a
fascination
about
it
which
makes
the
american
love
very
insipid
in
comparison
in
childhood
boys
and
girls
are
never
permitted
to
be
together
there
is
no
rather
sweet
remembrance
of
when
we
first
began
to
love
or
having
to
stand
with
our
face
in
the
corner
for
passing
love
letters
or
the
fun
of
playing
copenhagen
when
we
did
run
one
bit
hard
it
is
only
of
a
dirty
little
schoolroom
filled
with
dusky
all
of
the
same
wearing
apparel
who
studied
out
loud
a
fat
little
teacher
who
never
wore
tight
dresses
and
who
only
combed
her
hair
after
the
senoritas
had
gone
home
a
scolding
french
master
and
an
equally
bad
music
master
completes
the
memories
when
mexican
damsels
reach
that
hood
which
permits
of
long
dresses
and
big
bustles
they
are
in
feverish
expectation
until
during
a
walk
or
drive
a
flash
from
a
pair
of
soft
black
eyes
tells
its
tale
and
a
pair
of
starry
ones
sends
back
a
swift
reply
and
with
a
tender
sigh
she
realizes
she
has
learned
that
which
comes
into
the
lives
of
them
all
that
night
she
peeps
from
behind
her
curtains
and
watches
him
promenade
the
opposite
sidewalk
back
and
forth
the
gaslight
throwing
his
shadow
many
feet
in
advance
which
she
vows
next
to
him
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
she
ever
gazed
upon
she
does
not
show
herself
the
first
time
nor
does
he
expect
it
modesty
or
custom
prevents
just
as
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
breathe
a
farewell
to
her
balcony
a
white
handkerchief
flutters
forth
for
an
instant
he
kisses
his
finger
tips
the
light
goes
out
and
both
retire
longing
for
time
goes
on
and
she
gets
bold
enough
to
stand
on
the
balcony
in
full
glare
of
the
laughing
moon
whilst
he
walks
just
beneath
her
when
it
rains
he
will
stand
there
until
hat
and
clothing
are
ruined
to
show
his
devotion
when
she
goes
for
a
walk
he
is
sure
to
follow
slowly
behind
and
if
chance
offers
he
touches
his
hat
slightly
and
she
with
upraised
hand
deftly
gives
the
pretty
mexican
salutation
when
the
novelty
wears
off
all
this
she
gets
a
pencil
paper
and
cord
with
which
she
transfers
to
him
those
sweet
soft
little
nothings
which
the
are
so
fond
of
and
the
fair
fisheress
never
draws
in
an
empty
line
hers
are
but
the
repetition
of
what
almost
any
maiden
would
pen
badly
written
and
it
is
true
his
is
something
of
this
style
beautiful
entrancing
angel
your
loving
slave
has
been
made
to
feel
the
bliss
of
heaven
by
your
gracious
and
pleasing
condescension
to
notice
his
maddening
devotion
for
you
i
long
to
touch
your
exquisite
hand
that
i
may
be
made
to
realize
my
happiness
is
earthly
life
has
lost
all
charms
for
me
except
beneath
your
fortunate
balcony
which
has
the
honor
of
your
presence
only
bless
me
with
a
smile
and
i
am
forever
your
most
devoted
who
lives
only
to
promote
your
happiness
your
servant
who
bends
to
kiss
your
hand
every
letter
ends
with
this
last
as
we
end
ours
respectfully
if
they
do
not
care
to
write
it
out
fully
they
put
only
the
initials
for
every
word
if
a
girl
is
inclined
to
flirt
she
may
have
several
bears
but
her
fingers
tell
a
different
hour
for
each
if
two
should
meet
they
inquire
the
other
mission
and
their
hot
blood
leads
them
into
a
duel
which
however
is
less
frequent
of
late
years
no
difference
how
much
a
girl
may
care
for
a
duelist
she
does
not
see
him
after
he
has
fought
for
her
winter
comes
at
last
and
with
it
the
annual
receptions
of
the
different
clubs
a
mutual
understanding
and
many
fond
hearts
beat
in
anticipation
of
the
event
once
there
they
forget
the
eyes
of
their
chaperons
and
in
their
adorers
arms
they
dance
the
spanish
it
is
really
at
all
receptions
it
comes
in
every
other
dance
and
is
played
twice
the
length
of
any
it
is
the
one
moment
of
a
mexican
life
and
i
assure
you
they
improve
it
the
danza
is
rather
peculiar
and
not
at
all
pleasing
to
an
it
is
nearly
the
waltz
step
reduced
to
a
slow
graceful
motion
the
high
heels
and
tight
boots
prevent
any
swift
movement
the
gentleman
takes
the
lady
in
his
arms
and
she
does
likewise
with
him
as
nearly
as
possible
and
in
this
way
they
dance
about
three
minutes
then
encircling
as
two
loving
schoolgirls
walk
along
they
advance
and
clasping
hands
with
the
nearest
couple
the
four
dance
together
for
a
little
while
and
then
separate
this
repeated
by
the
hour
constitutes
the
spanish
danza
uninterrupted
conversation
is
held
continually
as
the
girl
cheek
rests
against
the
gentleman
shoulder
love
is
whispered
proposals
are
made
and
arrangements
for
future
actions
perfected
when
parents
notice
a
bear
if
they
are
favorably
inclined
they
invite
him
in
where
he
can
see
the
object
of
his
adoration
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
petticoats
of
forbidding
aspect
when
he
once
enters
the
house
it
means
that
he
has
been
accepted
as
the
girl
husband
and
there
is
no
backing
out
the
father
sets
a
time
for
a
private
interview
and
when
he
calls
they
settle
all
business
points
as
to
what
the
daughter
receives
at
the
father
death
when
the
marriage
shall
take
place
where
the
bride
is
to
live
and
how
much
the
intended
husband
has
to
support
her
the
lawyer
finishes
all
arrangements
and
escorts
the
engaged
pair
to
a
magistrate
where
a
civil
marriage
is
performed
that
their
children
may
be
legal
heirs
to
their
property
even
after
this
they
are
not
permitted
to
be
alone
together
the
intended
bridegroom
buys
all
the
wedding
outfit
for
the
bride
is
not
allowed
to
take
even
a
collar
from
what
her
father
bought
for
her
before
the
final
ceremony
is
performed
in
a
church
by
a
who
sprinkles
the
young
couple
with
holy
water
and
hands
an
engagement
ring
to
the
groom
which
he
puts
on
the
little
finger
of
his
bride
then
the
puts
a
marriage
ring
on
both
the
bride
and
groom
after
which
holding
on
to
the
priest
vestments
they
proceed
to
the
altar
where
they
kneel
while
he
puts
a
lace
scarf
around
their
shoulders
and
a
silver
chain
over
their
heads
symbolic
that
they
are
bound
together
irrevocably
as
there
is
no
such
thing
as
divorce
in
mexico
after
mass
is
said
the
marriage
festivities
take
place
and
last
as
long
as
the
husband
cares
to
pay
for
them
anywhere
from
three
days
to
a
month
and
then
like
the
last
scene
on
the
stage
the
curtain
goes
down
lights
are
put
out
and
you
see
no
more
of
the
actors
who
pleased
your
fancy
for
a
short
time
the
husband
puts
his
wife
in
his
home
which
is
henceforth
the
extent
of
her
life
she
is
devoted
tender
and
true
as
she
has
been
taught
she
expects
nothing
except
to
see
that
the
servants
attend
to
the
children
and
household
matters
and
she
gets
only
what
she
expects
he
finds
divers
amusements
for
according
to
the
customs
of
his
country
his
illusion
what
they
call
love
dies
after
a
few
days
spent
alone
with
his
bride
and
he
only
returns
at
stated
intervals
to
fondle
or
whip
his
captive
just
as
fancy
dictates
the
men
discuss
at
the
club
the
fact
that
he
has
more
loves
than
one
but
they
all
have
and
it
excites
no
censure
but
the
world
can
never
know
what
the
bride
thinks
private
affairs
are
never
made
public
he
can
even
kill
her
as
did
their
predecessor
cortes
and
it
will
excite
little
or
no
comment
when
matured
years
come
on
she
loses
what
good
looks
she
had
three
hundred
pounds
is
nothing
for
weight
and
on
her
lip
grows
a
heavy
black
mustache
she
cares
for
nothing
but
sleeping
eating
drinking
and
smoking
the
perpetual
cigarette
and
in
this
way
ends
the
fair
mexican
brief
dream
of
the
chapter
xxx
scenes
within
mexican
homes
the
city
of
mexico
makes
many
bright
promises
for
the
future
as
a
winter
resort
as
a
summer
resort
a
city
for
men
to
accumulate
fortunes
a
paradise
for
students
for
artists
a
rich
field
for
the
hunter
of
the
curious
the
beautiful
and
the
rare
its
bright
future
is
not
far
distant
already
its
wonders
are
related
to
the
enterprising
people
of
the
states
who
are
making
tours
through
the
land
that
held
cities
even
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
america
the
mexican
central
road
although
completed
only
five
years
ago
offers
every
and
even
more
comforts
than
old
established
eastern
roads
many
excursionists
have
had
delightful
visits
here
and
at
present
a
number
of
quakers
have
come
to
see
for
themselves
what
mexico
offers
one
of
the
party
was
quizzing
theo
gestefeld
editor
of
the
republics
on
the
advisability
of
opening
a
mission
for
the
poor
and
degraded
of
mexico
gestefeld
is
a
newspaper
man
formerly
employed
on
the
chicago
and
has
a
practical
and
common
sense
way
of
viewing
things
his
reply
should
be
studied
by
all
coming
to
mexico
to
stay
he
said
their
religion
has
been
the
people
faith
always
even
before
americans
lived
they
are
fanatics
and
trying
to
change
or
convert
them
is
wasting
time
let
their
faith
alone
and
go
out
and
buy
a
farm
on
the
and
teach
them
how
to
farm
and
how
to
live
you
will
find
them
ready
willing
even
anxious
to
learn
they
will
quickly
imitate
any
way
they
know
is
better
than
theirs
the
quaker
is
still
here
but
so
far
as
known
has
neither
started
a
mission
nor
bought
a
farm
mexico
is
colder
these
last
few
days
than
the
traditional
oldest
inhabitant
ever
remembered
but
it
is
a
pleasant
change
to
the
visitors
who
have
left
the
snowbound
country
even
if
a
fire
is
an
thing
people
who
read
history
form
wrong
ideas
of
how
mexican
houses
are
built
they
are
square
plastered
outside
and
decorated
many
are
three
and
four
stories
in
height
the
windows
which
are
always
curtained
are
finished
with
iron
balconies
massive
doors
on
which
are
ponderous
knockers
of
antique
shape
and
size
keep
from
view
the
inhabitants
of
the
casa
a
knock
and
the
doors
swing
open
and
a
brown
portero
dressed
in
the
garb
of
his
country
sombrero
serape
and
all
admits
you
to
the
lower
court
where
the
stables
are
kept
and
the
servants
live
beautiful
flowers
rare
orchids
and
tall
waving
palms
are
growing
in
rich
profusion
directly
up
through
the
center
is
a
large
open
square
a
stairway
decorated
in
the
highest
style
of
art
leads
to
the
different
departments
fine
statuary
singing
birds
and
fountains
mingling
with
the
flowers
aid
in
making
the
scene
superb
just
the
opposite
of
the
states
the
higher
up
a
room
is
the
better
it
is
considered
and
in
hotels
they
charge
accordingly
first
floor
second
third
and
so
on
a
room
is
not
healthy
unless
the
sun
shines
into
it
and
they
have
no
windows
just
glass
doors
all
the
hotels
in
mexico
are
run
on
the
european
plan
they
have
restaurants
attached
where
the
waiters
as
long
as
they
smile
can
not
do
too
much
for
their
customers
mexico
has
several
good
hotels
of
their
kind
and
most
of
them
equal
if
they
are
not
superior
to
the
iturbide
pronounced
eeturbeda
but
americans
who
run
after
royalty
want
to
stop
here
so
they
can
say
they
have
stayed
at
the
house
which
was
the
palace
of
the
first
emperor
after
mexico
was
independent
mexico
looks
the
same
all
over
every
white
street
terminates
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
look
which
way
you
will
the
streets
are
named
very
strangely
one
straight
street
having
half
a
dozen
names
each
square
has
a
different
name
or
designated
as
first
san
francisco
the
next
block
second
san
francisco
policemen
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
street
all
over
the
city
reminding
one
of
so
many
posts
they
wear
white
caps
with
numbers
on
blue
suits
nickel
buttons
a
mace
now
takes
the
place
of
the
sword
of
former
days
at
night
they
don
an
overcoat
and
hood
which
makes
them
look
just
like
the
pictures
of
veiled
knights
their
red
lanterns
are
left
in
the
place
they
occupied
during
the
daytime
while
they
retire
to
some
doorway
where
it
is
said
they
sleep
as
soundly
as
their
brethren
in
the
states
at
intervals
they
blow
a
whistle
like
those
used
by
street
car
drivers
which
are
answered
by
those
on
the
next
posts
thus
they
know
all
is
well
in
small
towns
they
call
out
the
time
of
night
ending
up
with
tiempo
sereno
all
serene
from
which
the
mexican
youth
with
some
mischievous
yankeeism
have
nicknamed
them
sereno
it
is
very
easy
for
those
unaccompanied
and
not
speaking
spanish
to
get
around
in
mexico
a
baggage
man
meets
the
train
out
from
the
city
who
not
only
attends
to
his
regular
duties
but
gives
any
information
regarding
hotels
that
visitors
may
want
numerous
carriages
of
all
kinds
and
descriptions
stand
around
the
depot
each
one
is
decorated
with
a
flag
by
which
the
visitor
may
know
the
price
without
asking
white
red
and
blue
fifty
cents
cents
and
one
dollar
the
drivers
often
try
to
get
the
best
of
a
tourist
especially
if
he
speaks
spanish
and
charge
him
one
dollar
for
a
cent
carriage
the
mexicans
do
not
differ
much
from
the
yankee
hackman
if
any
it
is
in
favor
of
the
mexican
they
do
not
cheat
so
much
because
they
are
not
sharp
enough
pulque
shops
where
they
deal
out
the
national
drink
are
quite
plenty
these
are
the
only
buildings
in
the
city
that
are
decorated
they
are
generally
corner
buildings
and
the
two
sides
have
pictures
of
ladies
men
on
horses
angels
floating
on
clouds
etc
numerous
flags
of
black
and
red
or
red
and
white
answer
for
a
sign
but
it
is
against
the
law
to
use
the
national
flag
these
saloons
or
shops
as
they
are
called
stand
wide
open
with
no
screens
to
hide
the
dirty
bar
and
drinkers
from
the
eyes
of
pedestrians
they
are
patronized
by
men
women
and
children
and
are
kept
open
all
the
time

los
angeles
en

de
vino
know
ye
not
pulque
that
liquor
divine
angels
in
heaven
prefer
it
to
wine
pulque
is
the
fermented
juice
of
the
agave
or
century
plant
which
matures
in
from
five
to
fifteen
years
instead
of
one
hundred
as
generally
believed
it
grows
wild
here
but
large
plantations
of
it
are
cultivated
just
before
the
plant
is
ready
to
blossom
the
natives
gather
the
big
fat
leaves
together
around
the
bud
forming
a
sort
of
basin
the
bud
is
then
cut
out
and
the
juice
from
the
stalk
collects
in
the
basin
one
stalk
will
yield
as
high
as
two
gallons
a
day
for
six
months
the
pulque
is
collected
in
jars
that
the
gatherers
carry
suspended
from
their
shoulders
it
is
sucked
out
of
the
basin
through
a
hollow
bamboo
or
reed
and
squirted
from
the
mouth
into
the
jar
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
does
not
render
the
stuff
any
more
palatable
to
foreigners
it
is
awfully
nasty
stuff
but
they
say
that
when
you
get
acquainted
with
it
you
like
it
real
well
mescal
is
a
sort
of
brandy
distilled
from
pulque
and
will
paralyze
almost
as
promptly
as
a
stroke
of
lightning
metheglin
honey
and
water

they
are
placed
in
a
piece
of

and
the
honey
squeezed
out
of
them
the
system
here
is
quite
unique
but
first
a
few
statistics
may
prove
interesting
they
run
on
ninety
miles
of
rails
and
carried
last
year
nine
million
passengers
the
company
owns
one
thousand
five
hundred
mules
and
horses
one
hundred
and
coaches
platform
or
freight
cars
and
funeral
cars
they
pay
an
annual
dividend
of
six
per
cent
on
a
capital
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
senor
castillo
speaks
spanish
and
english
they
are
very
particular
about
free
passes
and
so
far
this
year
have
only
issued
six
cars
are
exactly
like
those
in
the
states
and
the
look
just
like
the
black
maria
except
the
wheels
cars
just
like
open
freight
or
truck
cars
on
railroads
are
used
for
hauling
instead
of
wagons
and
a
dozen
of
these
loaded
with
merchandize
are
drawn
by
one
team
movings
and
everything
are
hauled
in
this
manner
the
price
charged
is
comparatively
small
cars
do
not
run
singly
but
in
groups
of
four
and
five
even
on
the
cars
men
smoke
as
much
as
they
wish
and
if
the
women
find
it
unbearable
they
go
out
and
stand
on
the
platform
there
are
two
conductors
on
each
car
one
sells
the
tickets
the
other
collects
them
when
the
line
was
first
opened
an
enterprising
stockholder
bought
up
all
the
hearses
in
the
city
and
had
funeral
cars
made
the
coffin
is
laid
on
one
draped
car
white
for
young
and
black
for
old
and
the

the

to
make

vigorously

which
the

makes
as

creeps

mexico
does
not
breakfast
when
people
go
into
the
restaurants
and
order
a
breakfast
the
waiters
look
at
them
in
wonder
and
inform
them
in
the
most
polite
terms
in
the
world
that
they
have
but
coffee
and
dry
bread
for
breakfast
it
is
asserted
that
to
eat
breakfast
will
cause
a
heaviness
and
dullness
for
the
entire
day
but
whether
this
is
true
or
otherwise
it
can
not
be
stated
for
since
our
arrival
in
mexico
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
other
than
as
before
mentioned
and
black
coffee
at
that
every
family
takes
their
coffee
in
their
bedrooms
it
takes
at
least
two
hours
to
get
through
an
ordinary
dinner
a
description
of
dinner
in
a
private
family
will
no
doubt
prove
interesting
to
most
readers
especially
if
they
understand
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
admission
into
a
family
a
mexican
will
be
all
politeness
will
do
anything
for
you
will
place
his
house
at
your
service
but
he
and
his
family
will
move
out
he
will
do
anything
but
admit
you
to
the
secrecy
of
his
house
so
this
experience
is
rare
dinner
was
announced
and
the
gentlemen
in
the
most
courteous
manner
offered
their
arms
and
we
walked
along
the
balcony
to
the
the
doors
were
swung
open
and
there
before
us
was
the
table
with
plate
knife
and
fork
and
a
penny
loaf
of
bread
at
each
place
we
sit
down
take
our
napkins
and
the
waiters
always
men
fill
our
glasses
from
the
elegant
water
bottles
that
grace
each
end
of
the
table
one
dish
containing
perhaps
cold
meat
salad
red
pepper
radishes
and
pickled
beans
is
served
on
plates
and
the
first
ones
taken
away
from
us
although
not
used
after
endeavoring
to
swallow
some
of
this
nauseating
stuff
which
the
natives
devour
with
relish
the
servant
removes
the
dish
our
plates
knives
and
forks
and
another
equally
strange
and
equally
detestable
dish
is
brought
on
thus
the
feast
continues
meanwhile
breaking
the
penny
loaf
in
bits
and
eating
without
a
spread
butter
which
commands
a
pound
is
never
seen
from
one
year
end
to
another
and
jelly
is
an
dish
the
last
dish
and
one
that
is
never
omitted
from
dinner
or
supper
is
frijoles
pronounced
consists
of
beans
brown
ones
with
a
sort
of
gravy
over
them
if
a
bostonian
were
but
to
visit
this
country
his
intellectual
stomach
or
appetite
would
be
sated
for
once
sliced
orange
covered
with
sugar
and
cinnamon
is
dessert
after
which
comes
chocolate
or
coffee
the
former
superb
the
latter
miserable
with
the
coffee
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
smoke
their
cigarettes
children
are
really
good
here
their
reverence
for
their
parents
being
something
beautiful
when
entering
the
dining
room
each
one
kisses
its
mother
hand
and
when
she
asks
them
if
they
wish
such
and
such
to
eat
they
reply
with
your
permission
although
all
are
smokers
they
could
not
be
persuaded
to
take
a
cigarette
in
their
mother
presence
the
pulque
which
is
also
given
around
with
the
coffee
they
refuse
through
respect
to
their
mother
but
they
drink
when
she
is
not
by
and
of
course
she
is
aware
of
the
fact
and
has
no
desire
to
prohibit
them
from
it
it
is
just
their
form
of
respect
to
refrain
in
her
presence
a
mexican
could
not
be
compelled
to
eat
of
two
different
dishes
from
one
plate
even
the
smallest
child
is
proof
against
persuasion
on
this
point
the
frijoles
or
beans
are
served
on
a
tortilla
a
sort
of
baked
in
the
shape
of
a
buckwheat
cake
another
tortilla
is
folded
together
and
answers
for
a
spoon
after
finishing
the
beans
it
is
not
considered
proper
or
polite
unless
you
eat
your
spoon
and
plate
every
family
has
at
least
half
a
dozen
servants
they
are
considered
excellent
when
they
receive
five
dollars
a
month
and
board
themselves
sometimes
they
are
paid
three
dollars
a
month
and
allowed
six
cents
a
day
to
furnish
what
they
want
to
eat
this
sum
is
called
the
retainer
women
do
the
cooking
and
the
men
wait
on
the
tables
make
the
beds
and
nurse
the
babies
contrary
to
the
usual
report
they
are
very
very
cleanly
every
room
in
the
house
is
swept
daily
balconies
and
uncarpeted
rooms
scrubbed
as
often
beds
which
are
always
single
iron
cots
like
those
used
in
hospitals
have
board
or
iron
bottoms
and
the
hardest
of
hard
pillows
brooms
are
an
unseen
article
notwithstanding
the
country
furnishes
the
most
beautiful
broom
corn
in
the
world
it
is
bought
in
bunches
and
tied
to
a
short
stick
and
used
in
that
manner
forcing
the
sweeper
to
bend
nearly
double
scrub
brushes
are
but
a
bunch
of
coarse
straw
tied
around
the
top
with
a
string
but
they
make
the
floors
perfectly
white
there
is
a
fortune
here
awaiting
some
lively
fellow
who
will
bring
machinery
and
make
brooms
and
brushes
for
the
natives
the
straw
costs
comparatively
nothing
and
is
of
the
very
best
quality
lotteries
swarm
here
and
are
a
curse
to
the
poor
men
women
and
children
sell
the
tickets
along
the
streets
and
the
poor
have
such
a
mania
for
buying
that
they
will
pawn
their
clothing
in
order
to
obtain
a
ticket
there
are
no
newsboys
in
this
country
occasionally
a
boy
is
seen
with
a
package
of
papers
but
he
does
not
call
out
like
they
do
in
the
states
women
generally
sell
papers
which
they
fold
and
hold
out
toward
never
saying
a
word
the
people
appear
just
the
opposite
of
lazy
they
move
along
the
streets
with
a
trot
equal
in
speed
to
the
burro
they
never
turn
their
heads
to
gaze
at
a
stranger
but
go
along
intent
on
their
own
affairs
as
if
they
realized
the
value
of
time
and
shortness
of
life
ladies
in
the
states
should
import
their
servants
from
mexico
their
hire
is
a
very
little
sum
they
furnish
their
own
food
they
are
the
most
polite
most
obedient
people
alive
and
are
faithful
their
only
fault
and
a
very
common
one
with
servants
is
that
they
are
slow
but
not
extremely
so
to
children
they
are
most
devoted
as
nurses
they
are
unexcelled
their
love
for
children
amounts
to
a
passion
a
mania
as
a
common
thing
here
a
girl
of
thirteen
is
not
happy
unless
she
has
a
baby
but
with
all
that
they
are
most
generous
with
them
much
amusement
was
caused
the
other
day
by
an
american
asking
a
pretty
little
girl
if
the
bouncing
babe
tied
to
her
back
was
hers
si
senor
and
yours
too
she
replied
politely
the
men
share
the
troubles
of
nursing
with
the
women
and
the
babies
tied
on
their
mother
or
father
back
seem
as
content
as
if
they
were
rocked
in
downy
cradles
babies
as
soon
as
born
are
clad
in
pantaloons
and
loose
waist
irrespective
of
sex
there
are
no
skirts
on
them
boys
retain
this
garb
but
girls
when
able
to
walk
are
wrapped
twice
around
the
body
with
a
straight
cloth
which
serves
for
skirts
if
you
ask
a
native
in
regard
to
the
sex
of
a
baby
he
will
not
say
it
is
a
boy
or
it
is
a
girl
but
el
hombre
a
man
or
la
mujer
the
woman
all
efforts
fail
to
make
them
say
hijo
son
or
hija
daughter
chapter
xxxi
the
romance
of
the
mexican
pulque
the
maguey
plant
is
put
to
as
many
uses
by
the
mexicans
as
the
cocoa
palm
is
by
the
south
sea
islanders
all
around
mexico
even
on
the
barren
plains
where
nothing
else
can
exist
it
grows
in
abundance
its
leaves
are
ten
and
more
feet
in
length
a
foot
in
breadth
and
about
eight
inches
thick
of
course
there
are
smaller
and
larger
growths
according
to
their
age
after
collecting
strength
for
about
seven
years
it
sprouts
from
the
center
a
giant
flower
stalk
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
on
which
often
cluster
three
thousand
flowers
of
a
greenish
yellow
color
these
wonderful
plants
in
bloom
along
the
plains
form
one
of
the
most
magnificent
sights
in
mexico
at
the
very
least
forty
have
been
seen
at
one
place
each
vieing
with
the
other
to
put
forth
the
most
beauty
a
prince
named
papautzin
of
the
noble
blood
of
the
toltec
discovered
some
fluid
in
a
plant
whose
flowering
spike
had
been
accidentally
broken
off
after
saving
it
for
some
time
he
had
the
curiosity
to
taste
it
and
that
taste
was
not
only
delicious
to
him
but
was
destined
to
moisten
the
throat
and
muddle
the
brain
of
the
mexicans
for
generations
and
generations
and
to
cause
the
curious
and
ever
inquiring
tourist
to
do
like
the
whale
did
at
the
taste
of
jonah
this
noble
prince
was
not
like
an
eastern
yankee
he
did
not
keep
his
month
shut
until
he
obtained
a
patent
if
he
had
telephones
and
gas
wells
would
be
nowhere
in
comparison
as
a
scheme
he
kindly
sent
some
to
his
sovereign
by
his
beautiful
daughter
xochitl
the
flower
of
tollan
the
noble
king
drank
and
looked
looked
and
drank
the
more
he
drank
the
more
he
liked
the
stuff
the
more
he
looked
the
more
he
liked
the
girl
so
he
kept
her
a
willing
prisoner
and
their
son
was
placed
upon
the
throne
generations
after
generations
rolled
by
lovely
xochitl
the
king
their
son
and
the
illustrious
discoverer
had
solved
the
wonderful
problem
the
maguey
plant
was
cultivated
by
thousands
and
oceans
of
its
fluid
had
gone
down
the
throats
of
the
natives
this
was
the
origin
of
the
mexican
national
drink
pulque
no
estimate
can
be
formed
of
the
amount
used
but
it
is
enormous
it
is
simply
water
for
the
natives
and
a
pulque
shop
graces
almost
invariably
every
corner
in
the
cities
as
stated
in
a
former
chapter
these
shops
are
the
finest
decorated
places
in
mexico
superb
paintings
of
all
scenes
grace
the
interior
and
exterior
flags
float
gracefully
over
the
doors
and
customers
are
always
plenty
men
women
and
children
can
be
seen
constantly
drinking
from
clay
pitchers
of
a
generous
size
for
the
full
of
which
they
pay
but
two
cents
no
respectable
mexican
would
enter
a
pulque
shop
but
they
all
drink
it
at
every
meal
the
maguey
is
planted
at
the
interval
of
three
yards
apart
and
in
such
a
manner
that
every
way
you
look
across
an
estate
the
plants
run
in
a
straight
line
they
thrive
in
almost
any
soil
and
after
planting
need
no
more
attention
until
the
time
of
flowering
which
is
anywhere
from
six
to
ten
years
the
indians
know
by
infallible
signs
just
when
the
flowering
stem
will
appear
and
at
that
time
they
cut
out
the
whole
heart
leaving
only
a
thick
outside
which
forms
a
natural
basin
into
this
the
sap
continually
oozes
and
it
is
removed
twice
sometimes
thrice
a
day
by
a
peon
who
sucks
it
into
his
mouth
and
then
ejects
it
into
the
jar
he
carries
on
his
back
as
soon
as
the
plant
exhausts
all
this
sap
which
was
originally
intended
to
give
strength
and
life
to
the
flowering
stem
it
dies
and
is
replaced
by
innumerable
suckers
from
the
old
root
great
care
must
be
exercised
in
cutting
the
plant
if
the
least
too
soon
or
too
late
it
is
the
death
of
it
when
first
extracted
the
sap
is
extremely
sweet
from
which
it
derives
its
name
aguamiel
honey
water
some
of
this
is
fermented
for
fifteen
and
days
when
it
is
called
madre
pulque
the
mother
of
pulque
this
is
distributed
in
very
small
quantities
among
different
pigskins
then
the
fresh
is
poured
on
it
and
in
hours
it
is
ready
for
sale
plants
ready
to
cut
are
valued
at
about
but
an
established
maguey
ground
will
produce
a
revenue
of
to
per
annum
pulque
is
brought
to
town
in
pig
and
goat
skins
it
has
a
peculiar
taste
and
smells
exactly
like
hop
yeast
from
the
mild
pulque
is
distilled
a
rum
called
mescal
it
is
of
a
lovely
brown
golden
color
and
very
pleasant
to
the
taste
one
can
drink
it
all
night
be
as
drunk
as
a
lord
and
have
no
big
head
in
the
morning
if
it
was
once
introduced
into
the
states
nothing
else
would
be
used
for
no
difference
how
much
is
drank
the
head
is
as
clear
and
bright
as
the
teetotaler
in
the
morning
nor
is
this
the
only
use
of
the
plant
poor
people
roof
their
huts
with
the
leaves
placing
one
on
the
other
like
shingles
the
hollowed
leaf
serves
as
a
trough
for
conducting
the
water
the
sharp
thorns
are
stripped
off
leaving
the
fibers
attached
and
the
natives
use
them
as
a
needle
already
threaded
paper
is
made
from
the
pulp
of
the
leaves
and
twine
and
thread
from
their
fibers
the
twine
is
woven
into
rugs
mats
sacks
ropes
harness
even
to
the
bits
and
dainty
little
purses
which
tourists
buy
up
like
precious
articles
the
wonderful
productive
powers
of
this
plant
do
not
end
here
the
expensive
cochineal
bug
used
for
coloring
purposes
and
for
paint
counts
this
maguey
its
on
its
wide
leaves
does
it
live
externally
and
internally
until
the
gatherer
comes
and
plucks
it
off
probably
to
color
some
dainty
maid
gown
in
the
far
distant
land
or
tint
some
sky
of
an
artist
dream
yet
maguey
thinks
it
has
not
done
enough
for
mortals
and
it
accomplishes
one
more
thing
for
which
the
mexicans
would
treasure
its
memory
but
americans
would
gladly
excuse
it
clinging
to
the
shadiest
side
in
a
childlike
confidence
is
a
long
green
worm
similar
to
the
unkillable
cabbage
worm
of
the
states
peons
in
a
gentle
manner
so
as
not
to
crush
or
hurt
pluck
these
tender
young
things
and
putting
them
in
a
vessel
bring
the
fruits
of
their
work
to
town
nothing
can
be
compared
to
the
way
and
haste
in
which
people
buy
them
fried
in
butter
a
little
brown
milk
gravy
around
and
they
are
set
on
the
table
as
the
greatest
delicacy
of
all
mexican
dishes
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
natives
eat
them
with
wonderful
relish
and
are
quick
to
say
we
know
what
these
dainty
things
are
but
you
folks
eat
oysters
chapter
xxxii
mexican
manners
among
the
most
interesting
things
in
mexico
are
the
customs
followed
by
the
people
which
are
quaint
and
in
many
cases
pretty
and
pleasing
mexican
politeness
while
not
always
sincere
is
vastly
more
agreeable
than
the
courtesy
current
among
americans
their
pleasing
manners
seem
to
be
inborn
yet
the
mexican
of
spanish
descent
can
not
excel
the
indian
in
courtesy
who
though
ignorant
unable
to
read
or
write
could
teach
politeness
to
a
chesterfield
the
moment
they
are
addressed
their
hat
is
in
hand
if
they
wish
to
pass
they
first
beg
your
permission
even
a
child
when
learning
to
talk
is
the
perfection
of
courtesy
if
you
ask
one
its
name
it
will
tell
you
and
immediately
add
i
am
your
servant
or
your
servant
to
command
this
grows
with
them
and
when
past
childhood
they
are
as
near
perfection
in
this
line
as
it
is
possible
to
be
when
woman
meets
woman
then
does
come
the
tug
of
war
but
instead
the
hug
and
kissing
the
kissing
is
never
on
the
lips
but
while
one
kisses
a
friend
on
the
right
cheek
she
is
being
kissed
on
the
left
and
then
they
change
off
and
kiss
the
other
side
both
sides
must
be
kissed
this
is
repeated
according
to
the
familiarity
existing
between
them
but
never
on
the
lips
although
with
an
introduction
the
lips
are
touched
the
hug
well
it
is
given
in
the
same
place
as
it
is
in
other
countries
and
in
a
right
tight
and
wholly
earnest
manner
from
the
first
moment
they
are
expected
to
address
each
other
only
by
their
christian
names
the
family
name
never
being
used
the
parlor
furniture
is
arranged
the
same
all
over
mexico
the
sofa
is
placed
against
the
wall
and
the
chairs
form
a
circle
around
it
the
visitor
is
given
the
sofa
which
is
the
seat
of
honor
and
the
family
sit
in
the
circle
the
eldest
nearest
the
sofa
the
visitor
expects
to
be
asked
to
play
the
piano
which
she
does
in
fine
style
and
then
the
hostess
must
play
after
her
or
commit
a
breach
of
courtesy
which
social
crime
she
also
commits
if
she
neglects
to
ask
the
guest
to
play
visitors
always
stay
half
a
day
and
before
leaving
she
is
treated
to
a
dish
of
fine
dulce
a
sweet
dessert
cigarettes
and
wine
then
mantillas
are
put
on
blessings
good
wishes
kisses
and
embraces
are
exchanged
each
says
my
house
is
yours
i
am
your
servant
and
depart
all
the
rules
of
decorum
have
been
obeyed
when
men
are
introduced
they
clasp
hands
not
the
way
americans
do
but
with
thumbs
interlocked
and
embrace
with
the
left
arm
then
the
left
hands
are
clasped
and
they
embrace
with
the
right
arm
patting
the
back
in
a
hearty
manner
the
more
intimate
they
become
the
closer
the
embrace
and
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
men
kiss
these
embraces
are
not
saved
for
private
or
home
use
but
are
as
frequent
on
the
streets
as
hat
tipping
is
here
the
hand
clasping
is
both
agreeable
and
hearty
they
clasp
hands
every
time
they
part
if
it
be
only
for
an
duration
and
again
when
they
meet
and
when
careless
americans
forget
the
rule
they
vote
them
very
rude
and
undoubtedly
as
a
nation
we
are
on
the
street
a
woman
is
not
permitted
to
recognize
a
man
first
she
must
wait
until
he
lifts
his
shining
silk
hat
then
she
raises
her
hand
until
on
a
level
with
her
face
turns
the
palm
inward
with
the
fingers
pointing
toward
the
face
then
holds
the
first
and
fourth
fingers
still
and
moves
the
two
center
ones
in
a
quick
motion
the
action
is
very
pretty
and
the
picture
of
grace
when
done
by
a
mexican
senora
but
is
inclined
to
deceive
the
green
american
and
lead
him
to
believe
it
is
a
gesture
calling
him
to
her
side
when
two
women
walk
along
together
the
youngest
is
always
given
the
inside
of
the
pavement
or
if
the
younger
happens
to
be
married
she
gets
the
outside
they
are
quite
strict
about
this
also
if
a
gentleman
is
with
a
mother
and
daughters
he
must
walk
with
the
mother
and
the
girls
must
walk
before
them
a
woman
who
professes
christianity
will
not
wear
a
hat
or
bonnet
to
church
but
gracefully
covers
her
head
with
a
lace
mantilla
no
difference
how
nicely
she
is
clad
she
is
not
considered
dressed
in
good
taste
unless
powdered
and
painted
to
the
height
reached
only
by
chorus
girls
four
years
ago
the
americans
tell
me
the
mexican
women
promenaded
the
streets
and
parks
and
took
drives
in
low
neck
sleeveless
and
with
enormous
trains
this
has
almost
been
stopped
although
the
finest
of
dresses
vivid
in
color
and
only
suitable
for
house
or
reception
wear
are
yet
worn
on
sundays
everybody
wears
jewelry
not
with
good
taste
but
piled
on
recklessly
i
have
seen
men
with
rings
on
every
finger
always
excepting
the
thumb
and
the
cologne
used
is
something
wonderful
you
can
smell
it
while
they
are
a
square
off
and
it
is
discernible
when
they
are
out
of
sight
a
man
is
not
considered
fashionable
unless
he
parts
his
hair
in
the
middle
from
his
forehead
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
dress
it
pompadour
the
handkerchief
is
always
carried
folded
in
a
square
and
is
used
alternately
to
wipe
his
dainty
little
boots
and
the
face
afterward
it
is
refolded
and
replaced
in
the
pocket
visitors
are
always
expected
to
call
first
to
see
their
friends
when
in
town
as
it
would
be
a
great
breach
of
decorum
for
a
family
to
call
on
a
visitor
before
he
or
she
came
to
their
house
if
two
or
more
people
meet
in
a
room
and
are
not
acquainted
they
must
speak
but
not
shake
hands
they
can
converse
until
some
one
comes
when
they
will
accept
an
introduction
and
embrace
as
if
they
had
just
that
instant
met
when
one
occupies
a
bench
in
the
park
with
a
stranger
neither
must
depart
without
bidding
the
other
farewell
and
very
often
while
murmuring
adieus
they
clasp
hands
and
lift
hats
mexicans
in
talking
employ
a
number
of
signs
which
mean
as
much
to
them
and
are
as
plainly
understood
as
english
words
would
be
to
us
they
speak
their
gracefully
indeed
they
are
a
very
graceful
people
and
yet
they
never
study
it
or
give
it
a
thought
when
they
want
a
waiter
in
a
restaurant
or
a
man
on
the
streets
they
never
call
or
whistle
as
we
would
do
but
simply
clap
the
hands
several
times
and
the
wanted
party
comes
the
system
is
very
convenient
and
far
more
pleasing
than
the
american
plan
when
wishing
to
beckon
any
one
they
throw
the
hand
from
them
in
the
same
manner
as
americans
do
if
they
want
any
one
to
move
on
to
go
away
they
hold
the
fingers
together
and
move
them
toward
the
body
they
never
say
that
a
man
is
drunk
it
sounds
vulgar
and
as
they
will
get
that
way
they
merely
place
the
index
finger
on
the
temple
and
incline
the
head
slightly
toward
the
person
meant
they
could
never
be
abrupt
enough
to
say
any
one
was
crazy
or
had
no
brains
so
they
touch
the
forehead
between
the
eyebrows
with
the
first
finger
to
speak
of
money
they
form
a
circle
of
the
thumb
and
forefinger
to
ask
you
to
take
a
drink
or
tell
the
servants
to
bring
one
the
thumb
is
turned
toward
the
mouth
to
ask
you
to
wait
a
little
while
the
first
finger
is
held
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
the
thumb
to
hold
the
palm
upward
and
slowly
move
the
hand
backward
and
forward
says
as
plain
as
english
i
am
going
to
whip
my
wife
or
i
whip
my
wife
if
they
want
you
to
play
a
game
at
cards
they
close
both
fists
and
hold
them
tightly
together
touching
the
thumb
rapidly
with
the
four
fingers
closed
means
you
have
much
or
many
of
anything
like
many
friends
making
a
scissors
sign
with
the
fist
and
second
finger
means
you
are
cutting
some
one
in
the
back
whittling
one
forefinger
with
the
other
means
you
got
left
when
courting
on
the
balcony
and
the
girl
smooths
her
lip
and
chin
you
are
warned
to
get
out
the
old
man
is
coming
in
company
when
one
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
sneeze
they
are
greatly
insulted
and
the
company
is
badly
wanting
in
good
manners
unless
just
as
the
sneeze
is
finished
every
one
ejaculates

noche
triste
tree
i
presume
everybody
who
knows
anything
about
history
remembers
reading
how
cortez
when
he
thought
he
was
going
to
lose
the
fight
for
mexico
on
july
retired
under
a
tree
and
wept
since
that
time
the
tree
has
been
known
to
the
inhabitants
as
the
noche
triste
the
sad
night
it
stands
before
an
ancient
chapel
in
a
public
square
of
the
little
village
of
popotla
i
do
know
why
for
i
could
never
think
of
cortez
except
as
a
thieving
murderer
but
the
noche
triste
receives
a
great
deal
of
attention
from
the
natives
and
all
the
tourists
on
the
second
of
may
the
tree
was
found
to
be
on
fire
a
citizen
of
popotla
senor
jose
maria
enriquez
who
venerated
the
old
relic
followed
by
hundreds
of
people
rushed
to
its
rescue
they
did
what
they
could
with
buckets
and
at
last
two
hand
pumps
were
brought
from
an
adjoining
college
it
is
said
that
fully
five
thousand
people
visited
the
burning
tree
that
day
after
burning
for
hours
the
flames
were
conquered
since
then
noche
triste
has
been
inclosed
by
a
high
iron
fence
despite
the
fire
it
is
yet
a
grand
old
tree
everybody
visits
the
cathedral
of
mexico
it
is
a
grand
old
building
of
enormous
size
and
covered
with
carved
figures
facing
the
zocalo
it
is
surrounded
by
gardens
in
which
are
many
beautiful
statues
and
ancient
aztec
figures
in
the
cathedral
is
the
tomb
of
the
emperor
yturbide
and
superb
paintings
some
by
murillo
the
history
of
the
cathedral
is
interesting
it
was
the
church
of
santa
maria
de
la
asuncion
until
january
when
it
was
declared
the
metropolitan
cathedral
of
mexico
philip
ii
issued
a
royal
decree
that
the
cathedral
should
correspond
to
the
magnificence
of
the
city
and
in
the
work
was
begun
it
occupies
the
very
ground
on
which
stood
the
principal
temple
of
the
aztecs
the
site
was
bought
from
the
franciscan
monks
for
forty
dollars
a
period
of
years
was
consumed
in
laying
the
foundations
raising
the
exterior
walls
building
the
transverse
walls
of
the
chapels
working
the
columns
to
the
height
of
the
capitals
and
making
some
progress
upon
the
domes
the
architecture
of
this
temple
pertains
to
the
doric
order
the
structure
is
one
hundred
and
spanish
yards
in
length
and
in
width
it
has
one
hundred
and
windows
and
is
divided
into
five
naves
the
principal
one
of
which
measures
feet
in
width
from
column
to
column
the
aisles
correspond
in
number
to
the
chapels
formed
by
twenty
pillars
ten
on
each
side
from
base
to
capital
the
pillars
measure
feet
in
height
and
fourteen
in
circumference
the
roof
is
composed
of
domes
or
vaults
resting
upon
arches
the
church
is
pyramidal
in
form
its
height
diminishing
in
regular
proportion
from
the
main
nave
to
the
chapels
there
are
three
on
the
southern
front
two
on
the
northern
and
two
on
each
of
the
sides
after
years
of
continual
work
the
final
solemn
dedication
was
celebrated
december
the
cost
of
the
cathedral
exclusive
of
the
external
decoration
at
least
of
the
sagrario
amounted
to
so
that
it
may
well
be
said
that
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
were
invested
in
the
two
churches
whose
erection
extended
over
more
than
a
century
during
my
six
months
in
mexico
i
received
hundreds
of
letters
from
men
asking
my
advice
about
their
coming
to
mexico
for
business
purposes
i
never
give
advice
but
if
i
were
a
man
and
had
a
certain
amount
of
patience
i
should
go
to
mexico
if
one
can
get
used
to
the
people
and
their
movements
the
place
is
perfect
the
land
in
most
localities
is
the
easiest
imaginable
to
cultivate
a
farmer
can
have
as
many
harvests
a
year
as
he
has
space
he
can
sow
in
one
place
and
harvest
in
another
so
perfect
is
the
climate
the
only
complaint
is
of
the
lack
of
water
but
as
it
is
always
to
be
found
six
feet
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
one
can
have
it
anything
will
grow
if
put
in
the
ground
i
visited
one
place
that
had
been
barren
three
years
previous
and
it
was
the
most
beautiful
garden
spot
in
mexico
the
trees
were
equal
to
any
nine
year
old
trees
in
the
states
there
is
no
weather
to
interfere
with
their
growth
a
great
number
of
englishmen
germans
and
french
have
settled
in
mexico
and
by
their
thrift
are
accumulating
fortunes
rapidly
barring
a
little
dislike
the
americans
have
the
same
chances
mexico
produces
better
than
the
united
states
and
for
the
smallest
possible
cost
and
trouble
very
few
farmers
interest
themselves
in
so
there
is
a
place
for
americans
to
step
in
and
make
money
silk
culture
could
also
be
made
one
of
mexico
principal
industries
it
can
be
carried
on
with
little
or
no
capital
any
one
who
possesses
a
few
mulberry
tries
can
without
abandoning
his
regular
work
care
for
an
ounce
of
eggs
costs
five
dollars
and
it
will
produce
not
less
than
fifty
kilogrammes
of
cocoons
that
are
worth
one
dollar
per
kilogramme
it
is
only
necessary
to
buy
eggs
the
first
time
for
the
worms
keep
producing
them
the
mulberry
tree
thrives
in
all
parts
of
mexico
and
the
silk
worm
needs
no
protection
of
any
kind
from
the
climate
nor
are
they
subjected
to
diseases
here
which
elsewhere
cause
great
loss
it
costs
less
to
raise
in
mexico
than
in
europe
and
a
far
better
quality
are
produced
mulberry
shoots
will
produce
sufficient
foliage
to
maintain
within
three
years
after
planting
the
eggs
while
containing
the
embryo
have
a
dull
lavender
color
but
after
discharging
the
worm
they
resembled
little
sugar
pills
the
worms
were
about
of
an
inch
long
but
the
first
week
of
moulting
shows
them
to
be
half
an
inch
long
and
the
second
week
one
inch
for
the
third
moulting
they
are
placed
on
perforated
paper
through
the
holes
of
which
the
worms
crawl
this
relieves
the
attendant
of
considerable
labor
in
transferring
them
the
fourth
week
the
head
is
white
and
the
worm
has
attained
its
normal
growth
there
is
nothing
now
for
the
worm
to
do
but
leaf
around
and
lunch
on
mulberry
leaves
until
the
eighth
or
ninth
day
after
shedding
its
skin
the
fourth
time
when
he
or
she
as
the
case
may
be
proceeds
to
form
its
cocoon
it
is
then
of
a
golden
transparent
color
it
takes
about
five
days
for
the
industrious
worm
to
finish
its
cocoon
then
to
destroy
the
moth
inside
it
is
subjected
to
heat
and
the
cocoon
is
then
ready
for
spinning
when
ready
for
use
the
cocoons
are
soaked
in
a
tub
of
water
until
all
the
glutinous
substance
is
removed
with
a
small
the
cocoon
is
brushed
until
ends
which
are
as
fine
as
a
cobweb
come
loose
they
will
then
reel
off
without
breaking
one
cocoon
will
give
four
hundred
yards
of
raw
silk
indian

little
notes
of
interest
superstition
is
the
ruin
of
mexico
while
we
were
there
some
children
found
a
shell
containing
an
image
of
the
virgin
the
matter
was
deemed
miraculous
and
they
directly
decided
to
build
a
chapel
on
the
spot
where
the
shell
was
found
in
the
state
of
morelos
exists
a
stone
that
they
say
was
used
before
the
conquest
to
call
the
people
to
labor
or
to
war
the
stone
appears
to
be
hewn
in
the
center
of
the
upper
part
is
a
hole
which
runs
into
the
heart
of
the
stone
forming
a
spiral
on
fitting
to
this
a
mouthpiece
and
blowing
the
sound
of
a
horn
is
produced
somewhat
melancholy
in
tone
but
so
loud
that
it
can
be
heard
a
great
distance
the
ranchmen
of
that
locality
employ
it
as
a
means
of
calling
their
flocks
and
the
animals
quickly
obey
the
summons
it
is
known
as
the
calling
stone
there
is
a
tradition
about
this
stone
they
say
that
no
difference
where
it
is
taken
that
by
some
invisible
means
it
always
goes
back
to
the
spot
it
has
occupied
for
the
past
century
they
say
that
once
it
was
even
chained
in
a
cellar
but
in
the
morning
it
was
missing
and
when
they
searched
for
it
it
was
found
in
its
old
position
mexico
abounds
with
the
most
beautiful
and
wonderful
flowers
many
are
unknown
even
to
horticulturists
one
of
the
novel
flowers
i
heard
of
was
one
which
grew
on
the
san
jose
hacienda
some
leagues
from
the
city
of
tehuantepec
in
the
morning
it
is
white
at
noon
it
is
red
and
at
night
it
is
blue
at
noon
it
has
a
beautiful
perfume
but
at
no
other
time
it
grows
on
a
tree
there
are
very
few
fires
in
mexico
and
it
is
a
blessing
to
the
citizens
they
have
one
fire
company
but
no
alarms
when
there
is
a
fire
the
policemen
nearest
give
the
customary
alarm
three
shots
in
the
air
from
his
revolver
the
next
policeman
does
the
same
and
on
up
until
they
come
to
the
policeman
near
the
firemen
office
the
fires
are
always
out
or
the
place
reduced
to
ashes
before
those
noble
laddies
put
in
an
appearance
on
every

is
hung
a
sign
giving

the

block
the
turkeys
in
mexico
are
the
most
obliging
things
i
ever
saw
they
are
brought
into
town
in
droves
and
they
never
scatter
but
walk
quietly
along
obeying
the
voice
of
their
driver
if
he
wants
a
drink
he
makes
them
lie
down
and
they
stay
until
he
returns

hung
in

they
are

a
piece
of

is
tied
to
the
iron
balcony
and
everybody
knows
what
it
means
no
taxes
are
paid
on
empty
houses
or
uncultivated

people
never
rent

the

is
well
supplied
with
public
swimming
baths
one
can
have
a
room
and
private
bath
for
cents
everybody
of
any
note
takes
a
bath
every
morning
it
is
quite
a
pretty
and
yet
strange
sight
to
see
the
beautiful
young
girls
coming
leisurely
up
the
prominent
thoroughfares
early
in
the
morning
with
their
exquisite
hair
hanging
in
tangled
masses
often
to
their
feet
they
are
always
attended
by
a
maid
mexican
ladies
have
a
contempt
for
people
who
do
not
have
servants
they
never
carry
anything
on
the
streets
but
always
have
a
mozo
even
to
carry
an
umbrella

has
such
a

death
rate
from
yellow

the
mexicans
have
named
it
ciudad
de

the
city
of
the
dead
in
yucatan
the
maya
language
is
still
used
it
is
very
musical
and
is
written
all
in
capitals
it
is
considered
polite
and
quite
a
compliment
for
a
man
to
stare
at
a
lady
on
the
streets
i
might
add
that
the
men
by
this
rule
are
remarkably
polite
families
employ
street
musicians
by
the
month
to
visit
them
for
a
certain
time
daily
the
there
are
most
musical
instruments
shoes
are
never
marked
with
a
number
but
are
fitted
until
they
please
the
buyer
the
shoes
worn
on
the
street
are
what
would
be
the
pride
of
an
actress
they
are
very
cheap
the
easiest
english

for
the
mexican

they
all
like
to
speak

butter
is
seldom
seen
in

the
only
way
they
have
of
getting

by
its
forming
from

back
while
being
brought

town
it
is
skimmed
off
the
milk
by
the
hand
and
is
sold
at
a
big
price
it
is
never
salted
the
butter
is
always
wrapped
in
corn
husks
looking
exactly
like
an
ear
of
corn
until
it
is
opened
they
also
make
and
tying
it
up
in
green
reeds
sell
it
salt
is
very
expensive
it
costs
a
single
man
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
for
his

rent
and

he
must
also

the
mexicans
began
to
call
the

during
the

they
say
the
way
the
title
originated
was
this
at
that
time
an
old
ballad
green
grows
the
rushes
o
was
very
popular
and
all
the
american
soldiers
were
singing
it
the
mexicans
could
only
catch

and
so
they
have
ever
since
called

some
mexican
legends
there
is
hardly
a
spot
in
mexico
that
has
not
some
romantic
history
connected
with
it
and
the
tales
are
always
so
beautiful
and
full
of
thrilling
romance
i
would
like
to
live
in
mexico
some
time
and
devote
all
my
attention
to
gathering
these
interesting
stories
i
have
given
samples
of
them
in
the
history
of
don
juan
manuel
the
street
of
the
jewel
is
also
connected
with
a
story
full
of
love
and
its
companion
despair
here
dwelled
gasper
villareal
and
his
wife
violante
armejo
gasper
was
a
man
of
moderate
means
but
he
had
enough
to
preserve
his
wife
from
labor
she
was
of
wondrous
beauty
but
quite
strange
she
only
cared
to
hide
herself
in
her
home
she
loved
her
husband
and
he
was
as
jealous
as
a
mexican
can
be
one
day
a
young
noble
diego
de
fajardo
rode
by
the
door
and
being
thirsty
he
asked
the
mozo
for
a
drink
violante
sat
in
the
corridor
looking
upon
the
garden
and
dreaming
doubtless
of
her
absent
lord
true
to
the
instincts
of
her
race
she
ordered
the
mozo
to
take
the
stranger
a
glass
of
wine
the
servant
did
her
bidding
explaining
to
the
young
cavalier
the
reason
of
the
change
in
his
refreshments
diego
de
fajardo
felt
that
it
would
be
churlish
to
ride
away
without
acknowledging
the
gracious
hospitality
he
tossed
his
bridle
to
the
man
and
passed
into
the
garden
violante
still
sat
in
her
hammock
garbed
in
spotless
white
the
perfection
of
beauty
grace
and
innocence
the
young
had
not
uttered
his
thanks
until
he
had
vowed
to
win
gasper
lovely
wife
day
after
day
he
watched
the
casa
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
find
the
wife
alone
at
last
fate
favored
him
it
was
near
nightfall
when
he
saw
the
husband
come
forth
and
taking
saddle
ride
toward
the
city
in
a
moment
eager
and
confident
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
violante
and
confessed
his
love
she
did
not
full
into
his
arms
but
she
spurned
him
and
with
such
anger
that
he
saw
his
conduct
in
its
true
light
and
repentant
he
arose
from
his
knees
and
left
her
violante
started
to
her
chamber
to
seek
her
rosary
and
to
cool
her
throbbing
brow
with
the
touch
of
holy
water
when
her
foot
struck
a
sparkling
object
it
was
a
bracelet
with
her
name
violante
in
diamonds
close
beside
the
coronet
and
arms
of
de
fajardo
as
she
stood
her
husband
entered
having
to
return
for
something
he
had
been
struck
with
horror
to
see
a
man
rush
from
his
gateway
there
stood
his
wife
with
the
jewel
in
her
hand
the
evidence
of
her
guilt
without
a
word
he
sunk
his
dagger
in
her
breast
as
she
sunk
lifeless
to
the
floor
he
snatched
the
gleaming
bracelet
from
her
stiffening
fingers
and
left
the
house
diego
do
fajardo
was
wakened
in
the
morning
by
his
mozo
something
had
happened
and
he
was
wanted
to
go
out
in
the
street
to
see
if
he
could
understand
it
tremblingly
he

overflowed
and
almost
submerged
the
city
of
mexico
among
the
objects
found
drifting
upon
the
water
was
a
large
canvas
on
which
appeared
a
beautiful
representation
of
the
virgin
none
could
determine
where
it
came
from
so
a
chapel
was
built
for
it
it
is
called
our
lady
of
the
angels
for
centuries
it
has
received
the
veneration
of
man
another
inundation
occurred
in
and
all
the
chapel
except
the
side
holding
the
virgin
picture
was
washed
away
despite
all
the
storms
the
picture
was
said
to
be
as
bright
as
if
just
from
the
painter
brush
a
new
chapel
was
built
around
this
marvelous
painting
which
stood
until
when
another
flood
took
it
all
away
excepting
the
one
wall
holding
the
virgin
likeness
there
neglected
and
unprotected
it
stood
as
the
storms
had
left
it
until
when
a
succession
of
public
calamities
drove
the
people
to
implore
the
succor
of
the
virgin
a
building
was
again
erected
around
the
uninjured
painting
thus
until
the
present
day
the
people
in
need
seek
the
painting
to
pour
forth
their
prayers
at
its
feet
el

charming
spot

the
convent
was
a
group
of
massive
buildings
domes
and
turrets
now
crumbling
into
decay
in
the
monks
retreated
to
this
wilderness
to
mortify
the

strange
stories
of

their
sparkling

of

come
creeping
down
through

the

chapter
xxxvii
princess
josefa
de
yturbide
i
can
not
close
this
little
book
without
speaking
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
brilliant
women
in
mexico
the
only
daughter
of
the
emperor
after
the
execution
of
the
emperor
the
family
came
to
the
states
and
settled
in
philadelphia
josefa
was
sent
to
georgetown
to
receive
an
english
education
and
she
yet
retains
a
love
for
america
and
its
people
when
maximilian
entered
mexico
he
restored
the
titles
to
the
yturbide
family
and
invited
the
cultured
princess
to
become
a
member
of
his
imperial
household
subsequently
emperor
maximilian
adopted
augustin
yturbide
grandson
of
the
late
emperor
and
appointed
the
princess
josefa
guardian
of
the
prince
imperial
maximilian
soon
recognized
the
wonderful
executive
abilities
of
the
princess
and
he
consulted
her
on
momentous
occasions
had
he
taken
her
advice
i
doubt
not
but
that
mexico
would
have
had
an
empire
after
the
fall
of
maximilian
yturbide
formerly
alice
green
of
washington
claimed
and
recovered
her
son
who
had
been
temporarily
heir
presumptive
to
the
throne
of
mexico
the
princess
josefa
went
to
the
court
of
austria
nine
years
ago
she
returned
to
mexico
where
she
lives
in
seclusion
she
is
one
of
the
loveliest
women
in
every
respect
i
ever
met
her
rooms
at
the
hotel
humboldt
are
plain
but
contain
many
little
mementos
of
former
glory
the
pictures
and
busts
of
the
unfortunate
emperor
and
empress
occupy
prominent
positions
carlotta
was
only
years
old
when
she
came
to
mexico
said
the
princess
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
a
creamy
complexion
dark
eyes
and
hair
she
worshiped
her
young
husband
as
he
did
her
and
she
was
ambitious
for
his
sake
what
a
sad
fate
was
theirs
the
princess
then
showed
me
five
letters
she
had
received
from
carlotta
written
in
english
after
the
emperor
death
they
gave
no
evidence
of
her
insanity
the
princess
has
never
received
any
recompense
for
the
land
which
the
government
took
from
her
father
and
even
a
pension
due
her
which
now
amounts
to
some
hundred
thousands
has
never
been
paid
she
receives
many
promises
from
diaz
but
never
the
money
the
worst
things
the
mexicans
ever
did
for
themselves
was
to
shoot
maximilian
they
have
never
had
one
quarter
so
good
government
since
they
had
sworn
good
faith
to
the
emperor
and
said
if
he
sent
part
of
the
french
army
back
they
would
support
him
he
believed
them
and
when
he
found
that
they
were
dishonest
he
applied
to
napoleon
for
aid
when
he
received
no
answer
the
empress
eager
to
save
her
noble
husband
started
to
beg
napoleon
personally
for
help
much
against
the
wish
of
maximilian
the
republican
powers
getting
too
strong
for
the
emperor
some
advised
him
to
seek
refuge
until
things
grew
calmer
the
refuge
he
sought
was
the
prison
they
had
prepared
for
him
he
walked
into
it
and
he
never
came
forth
until
the
day
he
was
shot
his
bosom
friend
lopez
whom
the
emperor
had
enriched
had
made
a
general
and
intrusted
him
with
all
his
secrets
betrayed
him
to
his
enemies
on
june
maximilian
and
his
brave
comrades
miramon
and
mejia
were
led
forth
to
a
little
hill
near
queretaro
and
shot
maximilian
last
words
were
poor
carlotta
three
little
black
crosses
now
mark
the
spot
where
those
noble
men
died
