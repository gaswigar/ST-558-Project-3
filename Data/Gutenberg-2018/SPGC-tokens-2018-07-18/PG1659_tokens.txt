the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
is
the
third
part
of
a
trilogy
part
one
is
entitled
ferragus
and
part
two
is
the
duchesse
de
langeais
the
three
stories
are
frequently
combined
under
the
title
the
thirteen
dedication
to
eugene
delacroix
painter
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
one
of
those
sights
in
which
most
horror
is
to
be
encountered
is
surely
the
general
aspect
of
the
parisian
populace
a
people
fearful
to
behold
gaunt
yellow
tawny
is
not
paris
a
vast
field
in
perpetual
turmoil
from
a
storm
of
interests
beneath
which
are
whirled
along
a
crop
of
human
beings
who
are
more
often
than
not
reaped
by
death
only
to
be
born
again
as
pinched
as
ever
men
whose
twisted
and
contorted
faces
give
out
at
every
pore
the
instinct
the
desire
the
poisons
with
which
their
brains
are
pregnant
not
faces
so
much
as
masks
masks
of
weakness
masks
of
strength
masks
of
misery
masks
of
joy
masks
of
hypocrisy
all
alike
worn
and
stamped
with
the
indelible
signs
of
a
panting
cupidity
what
is
it
they
want
gold
or
pleasure
a
few
observations
upon
the
soul
of
paris
may
explain
the
causes
of
its
cadaverous
physiognomy
which
has
but
two
ages
youth
and
decay
youth
wan
and
colorless
decay
painted
to
seem
young
in
looking
at
this
excavated
people
foreigners
who
are
not
prone
to
reflection
experience
at
first
a
movement
of
disgust
towards
the
capital
that
vast
workshop
of
delights
from
which
in
a
short
time
they
can
not
even
extricate
themselves
and
where
they
stay
willingly
to
be
corrupted
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
justify
physiologically
the
almost
infernal
hue
of
parisian
faces
for
it
is
not
in
mere
sport
that
paris
has
been
called
a
hell
take
the
phrase
for
truth
there
all
is
smoke
and
fire
everything
gleams
crackles
flames
evaporates
dies
out
then
lights
up
again
with
shooting
sparks
and
is
consumed
in
no
other
country
has
life
ever
been
more
ardent
or
acute
the
social
nature
even
in
fusion
seems
to
say
after
each
completed
work
pass
on
to
another
just
as
nature
says
herself
like
nature
herself
this
social
nature
is
busied
with
insects
and
flowers
of
a
day
ephemeral
trifles
and
so
too
it
throws
up
fire
and
flame
from
its
eternal
crater
perhaps
before
analyzing
the
causes
which
lend
a
special
physiognomy
to
each
tribe
of
this
intelligent
and
mobile
nation
the
general
cause
should
be
pointed
out
which
bleaches
and
discolors
tints
with
blue
or
brown
individuals
in
more
or
less
degree
by
dint
of
taking
interest
in
everything
the
parisian
ends
by
being
interested
in
nothing
no
emotion
dominating
his
face
which
friction
has
rubbed
away
it
turns
gray
like
the
faces
of
those
houses
upon
which
all
kinds
of
dust
and
smoke
have
blown
in
effect
the
parisian
with
his
indifference
on
the
day
for
what
the
morrow
will
bring
forth
lives
like
a
child
whatever
may
be
his
age
he
grumbles
at
everything
consoles
himself
for
everything
jests
at
everything
forgets
desires
and
tastes
everything
seizes
all
with
passion
quits
all
with
indifference
his
kings
his
conquests
his
glory
his
idols
of
bronze
or
glass
as
he
throws
away
his
stockings
his
hats
and
his
fortune
in
paris
no
sentiment
can
withstand
the
drift
of
things
and
their
current
compels
a
struggle
in
which
the
passions
are
relaxed
there
love
is
a
desire
and
hatred
a
whim
there
s
no
true
kinsman
but
the
note
no
better
friend
than
the
pawnbroker
this
universal
toleration
bears
its
fruits
and
in
the
salon
as
in
the
street
there
is
no
one
there
is
no
one
absolutely
useful
or
absolutely
harmful
knaves
or
fools
men
of
wit
or
integrity
there
everything
is
tolerated
the
government
and
the
guillotine
religion
and
the
cholera
you
are
always
acceptable
to
this
world
you
will
never
be
missed
by
it
what
then
is
the
dominating
impulse
in
this
country
without
morals
without
faith
without
any
sentiment
wherein
however
every
sentiment
belief
and
moral
has
its
origin
and
end
it
is
gold
and
pleasure
take
those
two
words
for
a
lantern
and
explore
that
great
stucco
cage
that
hive
with
its
black
gutters
and
follow
the
windings
of
that
thought
which
agitates
sustains
and
occupies
it
consider
and
in
the
first
place
examine
the
world
which
possesses
nothing
the
artisan
the
man
of
the
proletariat
who
uses
his
hands
his
tongue
his
back
his
right
arm
his
five
fingers
to
live
well
this
very
man
who
should
be
the
first
to
economize
his
vital
principle
outruns
his
strength
yokes
his
wife
to
some
machine
wears
out
his
child
and
ties
him
to
the
wheel
the
manufacturer
or
i
know
not
what
secondary
thread
which
sets

all
these

of

and
patience
with
promises
of
lavish
wages
either
in
the
name
of
the
town

or
with
the
voice
of
the
monster
dubbed

thus
these
set
themselves
to
watch
work
and
suffer
to
fast
sweat
and
bestir
them
then
careless
of
the
future
greedy
of
pleasure
counting
on
their
right
arm
as
the
painter
on
his
palette
lords
for
one
day
they
throw
their
money
on
mondays
to
the
which
gird
the
town
like
a
belt
of
mud
haunts
of
the
most
shameless
of
the

of

in
which
the
periodical
money
of
this
people
as
ferocious
in
their
pleasures
as
they
are
calm
at
work
is
squandered
as
it
had
been
at
play
for
five
days
then
there
is
no
repose
for
this
laborious
portion
of
paris
it
is
given
up
to
actions
which
make
it
warped
and
rough
lean
and
pale
gush
forth
with
a
thousand
fits
of
creative
energy
and
then
its
pleasure
its
repose
are
an
exhausting
debauch
swarthy
and
black
with
blows
white
with
intoxication
or
yellow
with
indigestion
it
lasts
but
two
days
but
it
steals
s

wretched

emblem
of

hideous
nation
sublime
in
its
mechanical
intelligence
patient
in
its
season
and
once
in

terrible
inflammable
as

ripe
with
brandy
for
the
madness
of

with
wits
enough
in

to
take
fire
at
a
captious
word

signifies
to
it
always
gold
and
pleasure
if
we
comprise
in
it
all
those
who
hold
out
their

for

for

to
look
forward
has
met
with
a
wife
and
found
himself
a
father
and
after
some
years
of
hard
privation
he
embarks
in
some
little
draper

business
hires
a
shop
if
neither
sickness
nor

blocks
his

if
he
has
prospered
there
is
the
sketch
of
this
normal
life
and
in

hail
to
that
king
of
parisian
activity
to
whom
time
and
space
give
way
yes
hail
to
that
being
composed
of
saltpetre
and
gas
who
makes
children
for
france
during
his
laborious
nights
and
in
the
day
multiplies
his
personality
for
the
service
glory
and
pleasure
of

this
man
solves
the
problem
of
sufficing
at
once
to
his
amiable
wife
to
his
hearth
to
the
to
his
office
to
the
national
guard
to
the
opera
and
to
god
but
only
in
order
that
the
his
office
the
national
guard
the
opera
his
wife
and
god
may
be
changed
into
coin
in
fine
hail
to
an
irreproachable
pluralist
up
every
day
at
five
o
clock
he
traverses
like
a
bird
the
space
which
separates
his
dwelling
from
the
rue
montmartre
let
it
blow
or
thunder
rain
or
snow
he
is
at
the
and
waits
there
for
the
load
of
newspapers
which
he
has
undertaken
to
distribute
he
receives
this
political
bread
with
eagerness
takes
it
bears
it
away
at
nine
o
clock
he
is
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
flings
a
jest
to
his
wife
snatches
a
loud
kiss
from
her
gulps
down
a
cup
of
coffee
or
scolds
his
children
at
a
quarter
to
ten
he
puts
in
an
appearance
at
the
there
stuck
upon
a
stool
like
a
parrot
on
its
perch
warmed
by
paris
town
he
registers
until
four
o
clock
with
never
a
tear
or
a
smile
the
deaths
and
births
of
an
entire
district
the
sorrow
the
happiness
of
the
parish
flow
beneath
his
pen
as
the
essence
of
the
traveled
before
upon
his
shoulders
nothing
weighs
upon
him
he
goes
always
straight
before
him
takes
his
patriotism
ready
made
from
the
newspaper
contradicts
no
one
shouts
or
applauds
with
the
world
and
lives
like
a
bird
two
yards
from
his
parish
in
the
event
of
an
important
ceremony
he
can
yield
his
place
to
an
assistant
and
betake
himself
to
chant
a
requiem
from
a
stall
in
the
church
of
which
on
sundays
he
is
the
fairest
ornament
where
his
is
the
most
imposing
voice
where
he
distorts
his
huge
mouth
with
energy
to
thunder
out
a
joyous
so
is
he
chorister
at
four
o
clock
freed
from
his
official
servitude
he
reappears
to
shed
joy
and
gaiety
upon
the
most
famous
shop
in
the
city
happy
is
his
wife
he
has
no
time
to
be
jealous
he
is
a
man
of
action
rather
than
of
sentiment
his
mere
arrival
spurs
the
young
ladies
at
the
counter
their
bright
eyes
storm
the
customers
he
expands
in
the
midst
of
all
the
finery
the
lace
and
muslin
kerchiefs
that
their
cunning
hands
have
wrought
or
again
more
often
still
before
his
dinner
he
waits
on
a
client
copies
the
page
of
a
newspaper
or
carries
to
the
doorkeeper
some
goods
that
have
been
delayed
every
other
day
at
six
he
is
faithful
to
his
post
a
permanent
bass
for
the
chorus
he
betakes
himself
to
the
opera
prepared
to
become
a
soldier
or
an
arab
prisoner
savage
peasant
spirit
camel
s
leg
or
lion
a
devil
or
a
genie
a
slave
or
a
eunuch
black
or
white
always
ready
to
feign
joy
or
sorrow
pity
or
astonishment
to
utter
cries
that
never
vary
to
hold
his
tongue
to
hunt
or
fight
for
rome
or
egypt
but
always
at
heart
a
huckster
still
at
midnight
he
returns
a
man
the
good
husband
the
tender
father
he
slips
into
the
conjugal
bed
his
imagination
still
afire
with
the
illusive
forms
of
the
operatic
nymphs
and
so
turns
to
the
profit
of
conjugal
love
the
world
s
depravities
the
voluptuous
curves
of
taglioni
s
leg
and
finally
if
he
sleeps
he
sleeps
apace
and
hurries
through
his
slumber
as
he
does
his
life
this
man
sums
up
all
things
history
literature
politics
government
religion
military
science
is
he
not
a
living
encyclopaedia
a
grotesque
atlas
ceaselessly
in
motion
like
paris
itself
and
knowing
not
repose
he
is
all
legs
no
physiognomy
could
preserve
its
purity
amid
such
toils
perhaps
the
artisan
who
dies
at
thirty
an
old
man
his
stomach
tanned
by
repeated
doses
of
brandy
will
be
held
according
to
certain
leisured
philosophers
to
be
happier
than
the
huckster
is
the
one
perishes
in
a
breath
and
the
other
by
degrees
from
his
eight
industries
from
the
labor
of
his
shoulders
his
throat
his
hands
from
his
wife
and
his
business
the
one
derives
as
from
so
many
farms
children
some
thousands
of
francs
and
the
most
laborious
happiness
that
has
ever
diverted
the
heart
of
man
this
fortune
and
these
children
or
the
children
who
sum
up
everything
for
him
become
the
prey
of
the
world
above
to
which
he
brings
his
ducats
and
his
daughter
or
his
son
reared
at
college
who
with
more
education
than
his
father
raises
higher
his
ambitious
gaze
often
the
son
of
a
retail
tradesman
would
fain
be

himself
with

honestly
earned
monday
is
on
sunday
his
rest
a
drive
in
a
hired
carriage
a
country
excursion
during
which
his
wife
and
children
glut
themselves
merrily
with
dust
or
bask
in
the
sun
his
dissipation
is
at
the
restaurateur
s
whose
poisonous
dinner
has
won
renown
or
at
some
family
ball
where
he
suffocates
till
midnight
some
fools
are
surprised
at
the
phantasmagoria
of
the
monads
which
they
see
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
in
a
drop
of
water
but
what
would
rabelais
gargantua
that
misunderstood
figure
of
an
audacity
so
sublime
what
would
that
giant
say
fallen
from
the
celestial
spheres
if
he
amused
himself
by
contemplating
the
motions
of
this
secondary
life
of
paris
of
which
here
is
one
of
the
formulae
have
you
seen
one
of
those
little
constructions
cold
in
summer
and
with
no
other
warmth
than
a
small
stove
in
winter
placed
beneath
the
vast
copper
dome
which
crowns
the
madame
is
there
by
morning
she
is
engaged
at
the
markets
and
makes
by
this
occupation
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
people
say
monsieur
when
madame
is
up
passes
into
a
gloomy
office
where
he
lends
money
till
the
to
the
tradesmen
of
his
district
by
nine
o
clock
he
is
at
the
passport
office
of
which
he
is
one
of
the
minor
officials
by
evening
he
is
at
the
of
the
theatre
italien
or
of
any
other
theatre
you
like
the
children
are
put
out
to
nurse
and
only
return
to
be
sent
to
college
or
to
monsieur
and
madame
live
on
the
third
floor
have
but
one
cook
give
dances
in
a
salon
twelve
foot
by
eight
lit
by
argand
lamps
but
they
give
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
to
their
daughter
and
retire
at
the
age
of
fifty
an
age
when
they
begin
to
show
themselves
on
the
balcony
of
the
opera
in
a
at
longchamps
or
on
sunny
days
in
faded
clothes
on
the
boulevards
the
fruit
of
all
this
sowing
respected
by
their
neighbors
in
good
odor
with
the
government
connected
with
the
upper
middle
classes
monsieur
obtains
at
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
his
daughter
s
a
parochial
mayor
invites
him
to
his
evenings
these
labors
then
are
for
the
good
of
the
children
whom
these
lower
middle
classes
are
inevitably
driven
to
exalt
thus
each
sphere
directs
all
its
efforts
towards
the
sphere
above
it
the
son
of
the
rich
grocer
becomes
a
notary
the
son
of
the
timber
merchant
becomes
a
magistrate
no
link
is
wanting
in
the
chain
and
everything
stimulates
the
upward
march
of
money
thus
we
are
brought
to
the
third
circle
of
this
hell
which
perhaps
will
some
day
find
its
dante
in
this
third
social
circle
a
sort
of
parisian
belly
in
which
the
interests
of
the
town
are
digested
and
where
they
are
condensed
into
the
form
known
as
there
moves
and
agitates
as
by
some
acrid
and
bitter
intestinal
process
the
crowd
of
lawyers
doctors
notaries
councillors
business
men
bankers
big
merchants
speculators
and
magistrates
here
are
to
be
found
even
more
causes
of
moral
and
physical
destruction
than
elsewhere
these
people
almost
all
of
them
live
in
unhealthy
offices
in
fetid
in
little
barred
dens
and
spend
their
days
bowed
down
beneath
the
weight
of
affairs
they
rise
at
dawn
to
be
in
time
not
to
be
left
behind
to
gain
all
or
not
to
lose
to
overreach
a
man
or
his
money
to
open
or
wind
up
some
business
to
take
advantage
of
some
fleeting
opportunity
to
get
a
man
hanged
or
set
him
free
they
infect
their
horses
they
overdrive
and
age
and
break
them
like
their
own
legs
before
their
time
time
is
their
tyrant
it
fails
them
it
escapes
them
they
can
neither
expand
it
nor
cut
it
short
what
soul
can
remain
great
pure
moral
and
generous
and
consequently
what
face
retain
its
beauty
in
this
depraving
practice
of
a
calling
which
compels
one
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
public
sorrows
to
analyze
them
to
weigh
them
estimate
them
and
mark
them
out
by
rule
where
do
these
folk
put
aside
their
hearts
i
do
not
know
but
they
leave
them
somewhere
or
other
when
they
have
any
before
they
descend
each
morning
into
the
abyss
of
the
misery
which
puts
families
on
the
rack
for
them
there
is
no
such
thing
as
mystery
they
see
the
reverse
side
of
society
whose
confessors
they
are
and
despise
it
then
whatever
they
do
owing
to
their
contact
with
corruption
they
either
are
horrified
at
it
and
grow
gloomy
or
else
out
of
lassitude
or
some
secret
compromise
espouse
it
in
fine
they
necessarily
become
callous
to
every
sentiment
since
man
his
laws
and
his
institutions
make
them
steal
like
jackals
from
corpses
that
are
still
warm
at
all
hours
the
financier
is
trampling
on
the
living
the
attorney
on
the
dead
the
pleader
on
the
conscience
forced
to
be
speaking
without
a
rest
they
all
substitute
words
for
ideas
phrases
for
feelings
and
their
soul
becomes
a
larynx
neither
the
great
merchant
nor
the
judge
nor
the
pleader
preserves
his
sense
of
right
they
feel
no
more
they
apply
set
rules
that
leave
cases
out
of
count
borne
along
by
their
headlong
course
they
are
neither
husbands
nor
fathers
nor
lovers
they
glide
on
sledges
over
the
facts
of
life
and
live
at
all
times
at
the
high
pressure
conduced
by
business
and
the
vast
city
when
they
return
to
their
homes
they
are
required
to
go
to
a
ball
to
the
opera
into
society
where
they
can
make
clients
acquaintances
protectors
they
all
eat
to
excess
play
and
keep
vigil
and
their
faces
become
bloated
flushed
and
emaciated
to
this
terrific
expenditure
of
intellectual
strength
to
such
multifold
moral
contradictions
they
oppose
not
indeed
pleasure
it
would
be
too
pale
a
contrast
but
debauchery
a
debauchery
both
secret
and
alarming
for
they
have
all
means
at
their
disposal
and
fix
the
morality
of
society
their
genuine
stupidity
lies
hid
beneath
their
specialism
they
know
their
business
but
are
ignorant
of
everything
which
is
outside
it
so
that
to
preserve
their
they
question
everything
are
crudely
and
crookedly
critical
they
appear
to
be
sceptics
and
are
in
reality
simpletons
they
swamp
their
wits
in
interminable
arguments
almost
all
conveniently
adopt
social
literary
or
political
prejudices
to
do
away
with
the
need
of
having
opinions
just
as
they
adapt
their
conscience
to
the
standard
of
the
code
or
the
tribunal
of
commerce
having
started
early
to
become
men
of
note
they
turn
into
mediocrities
and
crawl
over
the
high
places
of
the
world
so
too
their
faces
present
the
harsh
pallor
the
deceitful
coloring
those
dull
tarnished
eyes
and
garrulous
sensual
mouths
in
which
the
observer
recognizes
the
symptoms
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
thought
and
its
rotation
in
the
circle
of
a
special
idea
which
destroys
the
creative
faculties
of
the
brain
and
the
gift
of
seeing
in
large
of
generalizing
and
deducing
no
man
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
caught
in
the
revolutions
of
the
gear
of
these
huge
machines
can
ever
become
great
if
he
is
a
doctor
either
he
has
practised
little
or
he
is
an
exception
a
bichat
who
dies
young
if
a
great
merchant
something
remains
he
is
almost
jacques

did
robespierre
practise
danton
was
an
idler
who
waited
but
who
moreover
has
ever
felt
envious
of
the
figures
of
danton
and
robespierre
however
lofty
they
were
these
men

affairs

money
to
them
and
hoard
it
in
order
to
ally
themselves
with
aristocratic
families
if
the
ambition
of
the
is
that
of
the
small
tradesman
here
too
are
the
same
passions
the
type
of
this
class
might
be
either
an
ambitious
bourgeois
who
after
a
life
of
privation
and
continual
scheming
passes
into
the
council
of
state
as
an
ant
passes
through
a
chink
or
some
newspaper
editor
jaded
with
intrigue
whom
the
king
makes
a
peer
of
france
perhaps
to
revenge
himself
on
the
nobility
or
some
notary
become
mayor
of
his
parish
all
people
crushed
with
business
who
if
they
attain
their
end
are
literally
in
its
attainment
in
france
the
usage
is
to
glorify
wigs
napoleon
louis
the
great
rulers
alone
have
always
wished
for
young
men
to
fulfil
their
projects
above
this
sphere
the
artist
world
exists
but
here
too
the
faces
stamped
with
the
seal
of
originality
are
worn
nobly
indeed
but
worn
fatigued
nervous
harassed
by
a
need
of
production
outrun
by
their
costly
fantasies
worn
out
by
devouring
genius
hungry
for
pleasure
the
artists
of
paris
would
all
regain
by
excessive
labor
what
they
have
lost
by
idleness
and
vainly
seek
to
reconcile
the
world
and
glory
money
and
art
to
begin
with
the
artist

ceaselessly
panting
under
his
creditors
his
necessities
beget
his
debts
and
his

of
him

his
labor
his
pleasure

the

before
his

the
journalist
is
a
marching
thought
like
the
soldier
when
at
war
the
painter
who
is

fashion
is
crushed
with
work
the

with
no
occupation

he
feels
himself
to

gnaws
his
entrails

in
desperation
plunge
into
the
abyss
of
vice
others
die
young
and
unknown
because
they
have
discounted
their
future
too
soon
few
of
these
figures
originally
sublime
remain
beautiful
on
the
other
hand
the
flagrant
beauty
of
their
heads
is
not
understood
an
artist
s
face
is
always
exorbitant
it
is
always
above
or
below
the
conventional
lines
of
what
fools
call
the
what
power
is
it
that
destroys
them
passion
every
passion
in
paris
resolves
into
two
terms
gold
and
pleasure
now
do
you
not
breathe
again
do
you
not
feel
air
and
space
purified
here
is
neither
labor
nor
suffering
the
soaring
arch
of
gold
has
reached
the
summit
from
the
lowest
gutters
where
its
stream
commences
from
the
little
shops
where
it
is
stopped
by
puny
from
the
heart
of
the
and
great
workshops
where
its
volume
is
that
of
ingots
gold
in
the
shape
of
dowries
and
inheritances
guided
by
the
hands
of
young
girls
or
the
bony
fingers
of
age
courses
towards
the
aristocracy
where
it
will
become
a
blazing
expansive
stream
but
before
leaving
the
four
territories
upon
which
the
utmost
wealth
of
paris
is
based
it
is
fitting
having
cited
the
moral
causes
to
deduce
those
which
are
physical
and
to
call
attention
to
a
pestilence
latent
as
it
were
which
incessantly
acts
upon
the
faces
of
the
porter
the
artisan
the
small
shopkeeper
to
point
out
a
deleterious
influence
the
corruption
of
which
equals
that
of
the
parisian
administrators
who
allow
it
so
complacently
to
exist
if
the
air
of
the
houses
in
which
the
greater
proportion
of
the
middle
classes
live
is
noxious
if
the
atmosphere
of
the
streets
belches
out
cruel
miasmas
into
stuffy
where
there
is
little
air
realize
that
apart
from
this
pestilence
the
forty
thousand
houses
of
this
great
city
have
their
foundations
in
filth
which
the
powers
that
be
have
not
yet
seriously
attempted
to
enclose
with
mortar
walls
solid
enough
to
prevent
even
the
most
fetid
mud
from
filtering
through
the
soil
poisoning
the
wells
and
maintaining
subterraneously
to
lutetia
the
tradition
of
her
celebrated
name
half
of
paris
sleeps
amidst
the
putrid
exhalations
of
courts
and
streets
and
sewers
but
let
us
turn
to
the
vast
saloons
gilded
and
airy
the
hotels
in
their
gardens
the
rich
indolent
happy
moneyed
world
there
the
faces
are
lined
and
scarred
with
vanity
there
nothing
is
real
to
seek
for
pleasure
is
it
not
to
find
people
in
society
have
at
an
early
age
warped
their
nature
having
no
occupation
other
than
to
wallow
in
pleasure
they
have
speedily
misused
their
sense
as
the
artisan
has
misused
brandy
pleasure
is
of
the
nature
of
certain
medical
substances
in
order
to
obtain
constantly
the
same
effects
the
doses
must
be
doubled
and
death
or
degradation
is
contained
in
the
last
all
the
lower
classes
are
on
their
knees
before
the
wealthy
and
watch
their
tastes
in
order
to
turn
them
into
vices
and
exploit
them
thus
you
see
in
these
folk
at
an
early
age
tastes
instead
of
passions
romantic
fantasies
and
lukewarm
loves
there
impotence
reigns
there
ideas
have
ceased
they
have
evaporated
together
with
energy
amongst
the
affectations
of
the
boudoir
and
the
cajolements
of
women
there
are
fledglings
of
forty
old
doctors
of
sixty
years
the
wealthy
obtain
in
paris
wit
and
science
formulated
opinions
which
save
them
the
need
of
having
wit
science
or
opinion
of
their
own
the
irrationality
of
this
world
is
equaled
by
its
weakness
and
its
licentiousness
it
is
greedy
of
time
to
the
point
of
wasting
it
seek
in
it
for
affection
as
little
as
for
ideas
its
kisses
conceal
a
profound
indifference
its
urbanity
a
perpetual
contempt
it
has
no
other
fashion
of
love
flashes
of
wit
without
profundity
a
wealth
of
indiscretion
scandal
and
above
all
commonplace
such
is
the
sum
of
its
speech
but
these
happy
fortunates
pretend
that
they
do
not
meet
to
make
and
repeat
maxims
in
the
manner
of
la
rochefoucauld
as
though
there
did
not
exist
a
mean
invented
by
the
eighteenth
century
between
a
superfluity
and
absolute
blank
if
a
few
men
of
character
indulge
in
witticism
at
once
subtle
and
refined
they
are
misunderstood
soon
tired
of
giving
without
receiving
they
remain
at
home
and
leave
fools
to
reign
over
their
territory
this
hollow
life
this
perpetual
expectation
of
a
pleasure
which
never
comes
this
permanent
and
emptiness
of
soul
heart
and
mind
the
lassitude
of
the
upper
parisian
world
is
reproduced
on
its
features
and
stamps
its
parchment
faces
its
premature
wrinkles
that
physiognomy
of
the
wealthy
upon
which
impotence
has
set
its
grimace
in
which
gold
is
mirrored
and
whence
intelligence
has
fled
such
a
view
of
moral
paris
proves
that
physical
paris
could
not
be
other
than
it
is
this
coroneted
town
is
like
a
queen
who
being
always
with
child
has
desires
of
irresistible
fury
paris
is
the
crown
of
the
world
a
brain
which
perishes
of
genius
and
leads
human
civilization
it
is
a
great
man
a
perpetually
creative
artist
a
politician
with
who
must
of
necessity
have
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
the
vices
of
a
great
man
the
fantasies
of
the
artist
and
the
politician
s
disillusions
its
physiognomy
suggests
the
evolution
of
good
and
evil
battle
and
victory
the
moral
combat
of
the
clarion
calls
of
which
still
in
every
corner
of
the
world
and
also
the
downfall
of
thus
this
city
can
no
more
be
moral
or
cordial
or
clean
than
the
engines
which
impel
those
proud
leviathans
which
you
admire
when
they
cleave
the
waves
is
not
paris
a
sublime
vessel
laden
with
intelligence
yes
her
arms
are
one
of
those
oracles
which
fatality
sometimes
allows
the
of

her
great
mast
all
of
bronze
carved
with

and
for

the
barque

roll

but
she
cleaves
the
world
illuminates
it
through
the
hundred
mouths
of
her
tribunes
ploughs
the
seas
of
science
rides
with
full

cries
from
the
height
of
her
tops
with
the
voice
of
her
scientists
and
artists
onward

follow
me
she
carries
a
huge
crew
which
delights
in
adorning
her
with
fresh
streamers
boys
and
urchins
laughing
in
the
rigging
ballast
of
heavy
and
touched
with
tar
in
her
cabins
the
lucky
passengers
elegant
midshipmen
smoke
their
cigars
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
then
on
the
deck
her
soldiers
innovators
or
ambitious
would
accost
every
fresh
shore
and
shooting
out
their
bright
lights
upon
it
ask
for
glory
which
is
pleasure
or
for
love

thus
the
exorbitant
movement
of
the
proletariat
the
corrupting
influence
of
the
interests
which
consume
the
two
middle
classes
the
cruelties
of
the
artist
s
thought
and
the
excessive
pleasure
which
is
sought
for
incessantly
by
the
great
explain
the
normal
ugliness
of
the
parisian
physiognomy
it
is
only
in
the
orient
that
the
human
race
presents
a
magnificent
figure
but
that
is
an
effect
of
the
constant
calm
affected
by
those
profound
philosophers
with
their
long
pipes
their
short
legs
their
square
contour
who
despise
and
hold
activity
in
horror
whilst
in
paris
the
little
and
the
great
and
the
mediocre
run
and
leap
and
drive
whipped
on
by
an
inexorable
goddess
necessity
the
necessity
for
money
glory
and
amusement
thus
any
face
which
is
fresh
and
graceful
and
reposeful
any
really
young
face
is
in
paris
the
most
extraordinary
of
exceptions
it
is
met
with
rarely
should
you
see
one
there
be
sure
it
belongs
either
to
a
young
and
ardent
ecclesiastic
or
to
some
good
abbe
of
forty
with
three
chins
to
a
young
girl
of
pure
life
such
as
is
brought
up
in
certain
families
to
a
mother
of
twenty
still
full
of
illusions
as
she
suckles
her
to
a
young
man
newly
embarked
from
the
provinces
and
intrusted
to
the
care
of
some
devout
dowager
who
keeps
him
without
a
sou
or
perhaps
to
some
shop
assistant
who
goes
to
bed
at
midnight
wearied
out
with
folding
and
unfolding
calico
and
rises
at
seven
o
clock
to
arrange
the
window
often
again
to
some
man
of
science
or
poetry
who
lives
monastically
in
the
embrace
of
a
fine
idea
who
remains
sober
patient
and
chaste
else
to
some
fool
feeding
himself
on
folly
reeking
of
health
in
a
perpetual
state
of
absorption
with
his
own
smile
or
to
the
soft
and
happy
race
of
loungers
the
only
folk
really
happy
in
paris
which
unfolds
for
them
hour
by
hour
its
moving
poetry
nevertheless
there
is
in
paris
a
proportion
of
privileged
beings
to
whom
this
excessive
movement
of
industries
interests
affairs
arts
and
gold
is
profitable
these
beings
are
women
although
they
also
have
a
thousand
secret
causes
which
here
more
than
elsewhere
destroy
their
physiognomy
there
are
to
be
found
in
the
feminine
world
little
happy
colonies
who
live
in
oriental
fashion
and
can
preserve
their
beauty
but
these
women
rarely
show
themselves
on
foot
in
the
streets
they
lie
hid
like
rare
plants
who
only
unfold
their
petals
at
certain
hours
and
constitute
veritable
exotic
exceptions
however
paris
is
essentially
the
country
of
contrasts
if
true
sentiments
are
rare
there
there
also
are
to
be
found
as
elsewhere
noble
friendships
and
unlimited
devotion
on
this
battlefield
of
interests
and
passions
just
as
in
the
midst
of
those
marching
societies
where
egoism
triumphs
where
every
one
is
obliged
to
defend
himself
and
which
we
call
it
seems
as
though
sentiments
liked
to
be
complete
when
they
showed
themselves
and
are
sublime
by
juxtaposition
so
it
is
with
faces
in
paris
one
sometimes
sees
in
the
aristocracy
set
like
stars
the
ravishing
faces
of
young
people
the
fruit
of
quite
exceptional
manners
and
education
to
the
youthful
beauty
of
the
english
stock
they
unite
the
firmness
of
southern
traits
the
fire
of
their
eyes
a
delicious
bloom
on
their
lips
the
lustrous
black
of
their
soft
locks
a
white
complexion
a
distinguished
caste
of
features
render
them
the
flowers
of
the
human
race
magnificent
to
behold
against
the
mass
of
other
faces
worn
old
wrinkled
and
grimacing
so
women
too
admire
such
young
people
with
that
eager
pleasure
which
men
take
in
watching
a
pretty
girl
elegant
gracious
and
embellished
with
all
the
virginal
charms
with
which
our
imagination
pleases
to
adorn
the
perfect
woman
if
this
hurried
glance
at
the
population
of
paris
has
enabled
us
to
conceive
the
rarity
of
a
raphaelesque
face
and
the
passionate
admiration
which
such
an
one
must
inspire
at
the
first
sight
the
prime
interest
of
our
history
will
have
been
justified
erat
if
one
may
be
permitted
to
apply
scholastic
formulae
to
the
science
of
manners
upon
one
of
those
fine
spring
mornings
when
the
leaves
although
unfolded
are
not
yet
green
when
the
sun
begins
to
gild
the
roofs
and
the
sky
is
blue
when
the
population
of
paris
issues
from
its
cells
to
swarm
along
the
boulevards
glides
like
a
serpent
of
a
thousand
coils
through
the
rue
de
la
paix
towards
the
tuileries
saluting
the
hymeneal
magnificence
which
the
country
puts
on
on
one
of
these
joyous
days
then
a
young
man
as
beautiful
as
the
day
itself
dressed
with
taste
easy
of
manner
to
let
out
the
secret
he
was
a
the
natural
son
of
lord
dudley
and
the
famous
marquise
de
vordac
was
walking
in
the
great
avenue
of
the
tuileries
this
adonis
by
name
henri
de
marsay
was
born
in
france
when
lord
dudley
had
just
married
the
young
lady
already
henri
s
mother
to
an
old
gentleman
called
de
marsay
this
faded
and
almost
extinguished
butterfly
recognized
the
child
as
his
own
in
consideration
of
the
life
interest
in
a
fund
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
definitively
assigned
to
his
putative
son
a
generosity
which
did
not
cost
lord
dudley
too
dear
french
funds
were
worth
at
that
time
seventeen
francs
fifty
centimes
the
old
gentleman
died
without
having
ever
known
his
wife
madame
de
marsay
subsequently
married
the
marquis
de
vordac
but
before
becoming
a
marquise
she
showed
very
little
anxiety
as
to
her
son
and
lord
dudley
to
begin
with
the
declaration
of
war
between
france
and
england
had
separated
the
two
lovers
and
fidelity
at
all
costs
was
not
and
never
will
be
the
fashion
of
paris
then
the
successes
of
the
woman
elegant
pretty
universally
adored
crushed
in
the
parisienne
the
maternal
sentiment
lord
dudley
was
no
more
troubled
about
his
offspring
than
was
the
mother
the
speedy
infidelity
of
a
young
girl
he
had
ardently
loved
gave
him
perhaps
a
sort
of
aversion
for
all
that
issued
from
her
moreover
fathers
can
perhaps
only
love
the
children
with
whom
they
are
fully
acquainted
a
social
belief
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
peace
of
families
which
should
be
held
by
all
the
celibate
proving
as
it
does
that
paternity
is
a
sentiment
nourished
artificially
by
woman
custom
and
the
law
poor
henri
de
marsay
knew
no
other
father
than
that
one
of
the
two
who
was
not
compelled
to
be
one
the
paternity
of
de
marsay
was
naturally
most
incomplete
in
the
natural
order
it
is
but
for
a
few
fleeting
instants
that
children
have
a
father
and
de
marsay
imitated
nature
the
worthy
man
would
not
have
sold
his
name
had
he
been
free
from
vices
thus
he
squandered
without
remorse
in
gambling
hells
and
drank
elsewhere
the
few
dividends
which
the
national
treasury
paid
to
its
bondholders
then
he
handed
over
the
child
to
an
aged
sister
a
demoiselle
de
marsay
who
took
much
care
of
him
and
provided
him
out
of
the
meagre
sum
allowed
by
her
brother
with
a
tutor
an
abbe
without
a
farthing
who
took
the
measure
of
the
youth
s
future
and
determined
to
pay
himself
out
of
the
hundred
thousand
livres
for
the
care
given
to
his
pupil
for
whom
he
conceived
an
affection
as
chance
had
it
this
tutor
was
a
true
priest
one
of
those
ecclesiastics
cut
out
to
become
cardinals
in
france
or
borgias
beneath
the
tiara
he
taught
the
child
in
three
years
what
he
might
have
learned
at
college
in
ten
then
the
great
man
by
name
the
abbe
de
maronis
completed
the
education
of
his
pupil
by
making
him
study
civilization
under
all
its
aspects
he
nourished
him
on
his
experience
led
him
little
into
churches
which
at
that
time
were
closed
introduced
him
sometimes
behind
the
scenes
of
theatres
more
often
into
the
houses
of
courtesans
he
exhibited
human
emotions
to
him
one
by
one
taught
him
politics
in
the
where
they
simmered
at
the
time
explained
to
him
the
machinery
of
government
and
endeavored
out
of
attraction
towards
a
fine
nature
deserted
yet
rich
in
promise
virilely
to
replace
a
mother
is
not
the
church
the
mother
of
orphans
the
pupil
was
responsive
to
so
much
care
the
worthy
priest
died
in
a
bishop
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
left
in
this
world
a
child
whose
heart
and
mind
were
so
well
moulded
that
he
could
outwit
a
man
of
forty
who
would
have
expected
to
have
found
a
heart
of
bronze
a
brain
of
steel
beneath
external
traits
as
seductive
as
ever
the
old
painters
those
naive
artists
had
given
to
the
serpent
in
the
terrestrial
paradise
nor
was
that
all
in
addition
the
prelate
had
procured
for
the
child
of
his
choice
certain
acquaintances
in
the
best
parisian
society
which
might
equal
in
value
in
the
young
man
s
hand
another
hundred
thousand
invested
livres
in
fine
this
priest
vicious
but
politic
sceptical
yet
learned
treacherous
yet
amiable
weak
in
appearance
yet
as
vigorous
physically
as
intellectually
was
so
genuinely
useful
to
his
pupil
so
complacent
to
his
vices
so
fine
a
calculator
of
all
kinds
of
strength
so
profound
when
it
was
needful
to
make
some
human
reckoning
so
youthful
at
table
at
frascati
at
i
know
not
where
that
the
grateful
henri
de
marsay
was
hardly
moved
at
aught
in
except
when
he
looked
at
the
portrait
of
his
beloved
bishop
the
only
personal
possession
which
the
prelate
had
been
able
to
bequeath
him
admirable
type
of
the
men
whose
genius
will
preserve
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
compromised
for
the
moment
by
the
feebleness
of
its
recruits
and
the
decrepit
age
of
its
pontiffs
but
if
the
church
likes
the
continental
war
prevented
young
de
marsay
from
knowing
his
real
father
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
was
aware
of
his
name
a
deserted
child
he
was
equally
ignorant
of
madame
de
marsay
naturally
he
had
little
regret
for
his
putative
father
as
for
mademoiselle
de
marsay
his
only
mother
he
built
for
her
a
handsome
little
monument
in
pere
lachaise
when
she
died
monseigneur
de
maronis
had
guaranteed
to
this
old
lady
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
skies
so
that
when
he
saw
her
die
happy
henri
gave
her
some
egotistical
tears
he
began
to
weep
on
his
own
account
observing
this
grief
the
abbe
dried
his
pupil
s
tears
bidding
him
observe
that
the
good
woman
took
her
snuff
most
offensively
and
was
becoming
so
ugly
and
deaf
and
tedious
that
he
ought
to
return
thanks
for
her
death
the
bishop
had
emancipated
his
pupil
in
then
when
the
mother
of
de
marsay
remarried
the
priest
chose
in
a
family
council
one
of
those
honest
dullards
picked
out
by
him
through
the
windows
of
his
confessional
and
charged
him
with
the
administration
of
the
fortune
the
revenues
of
which
he
was
willing
to
apply
to
the
needs
of
the
community
but
of
which
he
wished
to
preserve
the
capital
towards
the
end
of
then
henri
de
marsay
had
no
sentiment
of
obligation
in
the
world
and
was
as
free
as
an
unmated
bird
although
he
had
lived
years
he
appeared
to
be
barely
seventeen
as
a
rule
the
most
fastidious
of
his
rivals
considered
him
to
be
the
prettiest
youth
in
paris
from
his
father
lord
dudley
he
had
derived
a
pair
of
the
most
amorously
deceiving
blue
eyes
from
his
mother
the
bushiest
of
black
hair
from
both
pure
blood
the
skin
of
a
young
girl
a
gentle
and
modest
expression
a
refined
and
aristocratic
figure
and
beautiful
hands
for
a
woman
to
see
him
was
to
lose
her
head
for
him
do
you
understand
to
conceive
one
of
those
desires
which
eat
the
heart
which
are
forgotten
because
of
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
them
because
women
in
paris
are
commonly
without
tenacity
few
of
them
say
to
themselves
after
the
fashion
of
men
the
of
the
house
of
orange
underneath
this
fresh
young
life
and
in
spite
of
the
limpid
springs
in
his
eyes
henri
had
a
lion
s
courage
a
monkey
s
agility
he
could
cut
a
ball
in
half
at
ten
paces
on
the
blade
of
a
knife
he
rode
his
horse
in
a
way
that
made
you
realize
the
fable
of
the
centaur
drove
a
with
grace
was
as
light
as
a
cherub
and
quiet
as
a
lamb
but
knew
how
to
beat
a
townsman
at
the
terrible
game
of
or
cudgels
moreover
he
played
the
piano
in
a
fashion
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
become
an
artist
should
he
fall
on
calamity
and
owned
a
voice
which
would
have
been
worth
to
barbaja
fifty
thousand
francs
a
season
alas
that
all
these
fine
qualities
these
pretty
faults
were
tarnished
by
one
abominable
vice
he
believed
neither
in
man
nor
woman
god
nor
devil
capricious
nature
had
commenced
by
endowing
him
a
priest
had
completed
the
work
to
render
this
adventure
comprehensible
it
is
necessary
to
add
here
that
lord
dudley
naturally
found
many
women
disposed
to
reproduce
samples
of
such
a
delicious
pattern
his
second
masterpiece
of
this
kind
was
a
young
girl
named
euphemie
born
of
a
spanish
lady
reared
in
havana
and
brought
to
madrid
with
a
young
creole
woman
of
the
antilles
and
with
all
the
ruinous
tastes
of
the
colonies
but
fortunately
married
to
an
old
and
extremely
rich
spanish
noble
don
hijos
marquis
de
who
since
the
occupation
of
spain
by
french
troops
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
paris
and
lived
in
the
rue
lazare
as
much
from
indifference
as
from
any
respect
for
the
innocence
of
youth
lord
dudley
was
not
in
the
habit
of
keeping
his
children
informed
of
the
relations
he
created
for
them
in
all
parts
that
is
a
slightly
inconvenient
form
of
civilization
it
has
so
many
advantages
that
we
must
overlook
its
drawbacks
in
consideration
of
its
benefits
lord
dudley
to
make
no
more
words
of
it
came
to
paris
in
to
take
refuge
from
the
pursuit
of
english
justice
which
protects
nothing
oriental
except
commerce
the
exiled
lord
when
he
saw
henri
asked
who
that
handsome
young
man
might
be
then
upon
hearing
the
name
ah
it
is
my
son
what
a
pity
he
said
such
was
the
story
of
the
young
man
who
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
april
was
walking
indolently
up
the
broad
avenue
of
the
tuileries
after
the
fashion
of
all
those
animals
who
knowing
their
strength
pass
along
in
majesty
and
peace
matrons
turned
back
naively
to
look
at
him
again
other
women
without
turning
round
waited
for
him
to
pass
again
and
engraved
him
in
their
minds
that
they
might
remember
in
due
season
that
fragrant
face
which
would
not
have
disadorned
the
body
of
the
fairest
among
themselves
what
are
you
doing
here
on
sunday
said
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
to
henri
as
he
passed
there
s
a
fish
in
the
net
answered
the
young
man
this
exchange
of
thoughts
was
accomplished
by
means
of
two
significant
glances
without
it
appearing
that
either
de
ronquerolles
or
de
marsay
had
any
knowledge
of
the
other
the
young
man
was
taking
note
of
the
with
that
promptitude
of
eye
and
ear
which
is
peculiar
to
the
parisian
who
seems
at
first
to
see
and
hear
nothing
but
who
sees
and
hears
all
at
that
moment
a
young
man
came
up
to
him
and
took
him
familiarly
by
the
arm
saying
to
him
how
are
you
my
dear
de
marsay
extremely
well
de
marsay
answered
with
that
air
of
apparent
affection
which
amongst
the
young
men
of
paris
proves
nothing
either
for
the
present
or
the
future
in
effect
the
youth
of
paris
resemble
the
youth
of
no
other
town
they
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
young
man
who
has
something
and
the
young
man
who
has
nothing
or
the
young
man
who
thinks
and
he
who
spends
but
be
it
well
understood
this
applies
only
to
those
natives
of
the
soil
who
maintain
in
paris
the
delicious
course
of
the
elegant
life
there
exist
as
well
plenty
of
other
young
men
but
they
are
children
who
are
late
in
conceiving
parisian
life
and
who
remain
its
dupes
they
do
not
speculate
they
study
they
as
the
others
say
finally
there
are
to
be
found
besides
certain
young
people
rich
or
poor
who
embrace
careers
and
follow
them
with
a
single
heart
they
are
somewhat
like
the
emile
of
rousseau
of
the
flesh
of
citizens
and
they
never
appear
in
society
the
diplomatic
impolitely
dub
them
fools
be
they
that
or
no
they
augment
the
number
of
those
mediocrities
beneath
the
yoke
of
which
france
is
bowed
down
they
are
always
there
always
ready
to
bungle
public
or
private
concerns
with
the
dull
trowel
of
their
mediocrity
bragging
of
their
impotence
which
they
count
for
conduct
and
integrity
this
sort
of
social
infests
the
administration
the
army
the
magistracy
the
chambers
the
courts
they
diminish
and
level
down
the
country
and
constitute
in
some
manner
in
the
body
politic
a
lymph
which
infects
it
and
renders
it
flabby
these
honest
folk
call
men
of
talent
immoral
or
rogues
if
such
rogues
require
to
be
paid
for
their
services
at
least
their
services
are
there
whereas
the
other
sort
do
harm
and
are
respected
by
the
mob
but
happily
for
france
elegant
youth
stigmatizes
them
ceaselessly
under
the
name
of
louts
at
the
first
glance
then
it
is
natural
to
consider
as
very
distinct
the
two
sorts
of
young
men
who
lead
the
life
of
elegance
the
amiable
corporation
to
which
henri
de
marsay
belonged
but
the
observer
who
goes
beyond
the
superficial
aspect
of
things
is
soon
convinced
that
the
difference
is
purely
moral
and
that
nothing
is
so
deceptive
as
this
pretty
outside
nevertheless
all
alike
take
precedence
over
everybody
else
speak
rightly
or
wrongly
of
things
of
men
literature
and
the
fine
arts
have
ever
in
their
mouth
the
pitt
and
coburg
of
each
year
interrupt
a
conversation
with
a
pun
turn
into
ridicule
science
and
the
despise
all
things
which
they
do
not
know
or
which
they
fear
set
themselves
above
all
by
constituting
themselves
the
supreme
judges
of
all
they
would
all
hoax
their
fathers
and
be
ready
to
shed
crocodile
tears
upon
their
mothers
breasts
but
generally
they
believe
in
nothing
blaspheme
women
or
play
at
modesty
and
in
reality
are
led
by
some
old
woman
or
an
evil
courtesan
they
are
all
equally
eaten
to
the
bone
with
calculation
with
depravity
with
a
brutal
lust
to
succeed
and
if
you
plumbed
for
their
hearts
you
would
find
in
all
a
stone
in
their
normal
state
they
have
the
prettiest
exterior
stake
their
friendship
at
every
turn
are
captivating
alike
the
same
badinage
dominates
their
jargon
they
seek
for
oddity
in
their
toilette
glory
in
repeating
the
stupidities
of
such
and
such
actor
who
is
in
fashion
and
commence
operations
it
matters
not
with
whom
with
contempt
and
impertinence
in
order
to
have
as
it
were
the
first
move
in
the
game
but
woe
betide
him
who
does
not
know
how
to
take
a
blow
on
one
cheek
for
the
sake
of
rendering
two
they
resemble
in
fine
that
pretty
white
spray
which
crests
the
stormy
waves
they
dress
and
dance
dine
and
take
their
pleasure
on
the
day
of
waterloo
in
the
time
of
cholera
or
revolution
finally
their
expenses
are
all
the
same
but
here
the
contrast
comes
in
of
this
fluctuating
fortune
so
agreeably
flung
away
some
possess
the
capital
for
which
the
others
wait
they
have
the
same
tailors
but
the
bills
of
the
latter
are
still
to
pay
next
if
the
first
like
sieves
take
in
ideas
of
all
kinds
without
retaining
any
the
latter
compare
them
and
assimilate
all
the
good
if
the
first
believe
they
know
something
know
nothing
and
understand
everything
lend
all
to
those
who
need
nothing
and
offer
nothing
to
those
who
are
in
need
the
latter
study
secretly
others
thoughts
and
place
out
their
money
like
their
follies
at
big
interest
the
one
class
have
no
more
faithful
impressions
because
their
soul
like
a
mirror
worn
from
use
no
longer
reflects
any
image
the
others
economize
their
senses
and
life
even
while
they
seem
like
the
first
to
be
flinging
them
away
broadcast
the
first
on
the
faith
of
a
hope
devote
themselves
without
conviction
to
a
system
which
has
wind
and
tide
against
it
but
they
leap
upon
another
political
craft
when
the
first
goes
adrift
the
second
take
the
measure
of
the
future
sound
it
and
see
in
political
fidelity
what
the
english
see
in
commercial
integrity
an
element
of
success
where
the
young
man
of
possessions
makes
a
pun
or
an
epigram
upon
the
restoration
of
the
throne
he
who
has
nothing
makes
a
public
calculation
or
a
secret
reservation
and
obtains
everything
by
giving
a
handshake
to
his
friends
the
one
deny
every
faculty
to
others
look
upon
all
their
ideas
as
new
as
though
the
world
had
been
made
yesterday
they
have
unlimited
confidence
in
themselves
and
no
crueler
enemy
than
those
same
selves
but
the
others
are
armed
with
an
incessant
distrust
of
men
whom
they
estimate
at
their
value
and
are
sufficiently
profound
to
have
one
thought
beyond
their
friends
whom
they
exploit
then
of
evenings
when
they
lay
their
heads
on
their
pillows
they
weigh
men
as
a
miser
weighs
his
gold
pieces
the
one
are
vexed
at
an
aimless
impertinence
and
allow
themselves
to
be
ridiculed
by
the
diplomatic
who
make
them
dance
for
them
by
pulling
what
is
the
main
string
of
these
puppets
their
vanity
thus
a
day
comes
when
those
who
had
nothing
have
something
and
those
who
had
something
have
nothing
the
latter
look
at
their
comrades
who
have
achieved
positions
as
cunning
fellows
their
hearts
may
be
bad
but
their
heads
are
strong
he
is
very
strong
is
the
supreme
praise
accorded
to
those
who
have
attained
political
rank
a
woman
or
a
fortune
amongst
them
are
to
be
found
certain
young
men
who
play
this
by
commencing
with
having
debts
naturally
these
are
more
dangerous
than
those
who
play
it
without
a
farthing
the
young
man
who
called
himself
a
friend
of
henri
de
marsay
was
a
who
had
come
from
the
provinces
and
whom
the
young
men
then
in
fashion
were
teaching
the
art
of
running
through
an
inheritance
but
he
had
one
last
leg
to
stand
on
in
his
province
in
the
shape
of
a
secure
establishment
he
was
simply
an
heir
who
had
passed
without
any
transition
from
his
pittance
of
a
hundred
francs
a
month
to
the
entire
paternal
fortune
and
who
if
he
had
not
wit
enough
to
perceive
that
he
was
laughed
at
was
sufficiently
cautious
to
stop
short
at
of
his
capital
he
had
learned
at
paris
for
a
consideration
of
some
thousands
of
francs
the
exact
value
of
harness
the
art
of
not
being
too
respectful
to
his
gloves
learned
to
make
skilful
meditations
upon
the
right
wages
to
give
people
and
to
seek
out
what
bargain
was
the
best
to
close
with
them
he
set
store
on
his
capacity
to
speak
in
good
terms
of
his
horses
of
his
pyrenean
hound
to
tell
by
her
dress
her
walk
her
shoes
to
what
class
a
woman
belonged
to
study
remember
a
few
fashionable
catchwords
and
win
by
his
sojourn
in
parisian
society
the
necessary
authority
to
import
later
into
his
province
a
taste
for
tea
and
silver
of
an
english
fashion
and
to
obtain
the
right
of
despising
everything
around
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
de
marsay
had
admitted
him
to
his
society
in
order
to
make
use
of
him
in
the
world
just
as
a
bold
speculator
employs
a
confidential
clerk
the
friendship
real
or
feigned
of
de
marsay
was
a
social
position
for
paul
de
manerville
who
on
his
side
thought
himself
astute
in
exploiting
after
his
fashion
his
intimate
friend
he
lived
in
the
reflecting
lustre
of
his
friend
walked
constantly
under
his
umbrella
wore
his
boots
gilded
himself
with
his
rays
when
he
posed
in
henri
s
company
or
walked
at
his
side
he
had
the
air
of
saying
don
t
insult
us
we
are
real
he
often
permitted
himself
to
remark
fatuously
if
i
were
to
ask
henri
for
such
and
such
a
thing
he
is
a
good
enough
friend
of
mine
to
do
but
he
was
careful
never
to
ask
anything
of
him
he
feared
him
and
his
fear
although
imperceptible
reacted
upon
the
others
and
was
of
use
to
de
marsay
de
marsay
is
a
man
of
a
thousand
said
paul
ah
you
will
see
he
will
be
what
he
likes
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
him
one
of
these
days
minister
of
foreign
affairs
nothing
can
withstand
he
made
of
de
marsay
what
corporal
trim
made
of
his
cap
a
perpetual
instance
ask
de
marsay
and
you
will
see
or
again
the
other
day
we
were
hunting
de
marsay
and
i
he
would
not
believe
me
but
i
jumped
a
hedge
without
moving
on
my
horse
or
again
we
were
with
some
women
de
marsay
and
i
and
upon
my
word
of
honor
i
was
etc
thus
paul
de
manerville
could
not
be
classed
amongst
the
great
illustrious
and
powerful
family
of
fools
who
succeed
he
would
one
day
be
a
deputy
for
the
time
he
was
not
even
a
young
man
his
friend
de
marsay
defined
him
thus
you
ask
me
what
is
paul
paul
why
paul
de
manerville
i
am
surprised
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
de
marsay
to
see
you
here
on
a
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
is
it
an
intrigue
an
bah
i
can
mention
it
to
you
without
compromising
my
passion
besides
a
woman
who
comes
to
the
tuileries
on
sundays
is
of
no
account
aristocratically
ah
ah
hold
your
tongue
then
or
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
your
laugh
is
too
loud
you
will
make
people
think
that
we
have
lunched
too
well
last
thursday
here
on
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
i
was
walking
along
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
but
when
i
got
to
the
gate
of
the
rue
de
castiglione
by
which
i
intended
to
leave
i
came
face
to
face
with
a
woman
or
rather
a
young
girl
who
if
she
did
not
throw
herself
at
my
head
stopped
short
less
i
think
from
human
respect
than
from
one
of
those
movements
of
profound
surprise
which
affect
the
limbs
creep
down
the
length
of
the
spine
and
cease
only
in
the
sole
of
the
feet
to
nail
you
to
the
ground
i
have
often
produced
effects
of
this
nature
a
sort
of
animal
magnetism
which
becomes
enormously
powerful
when
the
relations
are
reciprocally
precise
but
my
dear
fellow
this
was
not
stupefaction
nor
was
she
a
common
girl
morally
speaking
her
face
seemed
to
say
what
is
it
you
my
ideal
the
creation
of
my
thoughts
of
my
morning
and
evening
dreams
what
are
you
there
why
this
morning
why
not
yesterday
take
me
i
am
thine
good
i
said
to
myself
another
one
then
i
scrutinize
her
ah
my
dear
fellow
speaking
physically
my
incognita
is
the
most
adorable
feminine
person
whom
i
ever
met
she
belongs
to
that
feminine
variety
which
the
romans
call
the
woman
of
fire
and
in
chief
what
struck
me
the
most
what
i
am
still
taken
with
are
her
two
yellow
eyes
like
a
tiger
s
a
golden
yellow
that
gleams
living
gold
gold
which
thinks
gold
which
loves
and
is
determined
to
take
refuge
in
your
my
dear
fellow
we
are
full
of
her
cried
paul
she
comes
here
sometimes
girl
with
the
golden
that
is
the
name
we
have
given
her
she
is
a
young
creature
not
more
than
and
i
have
seen
her
here
in
the
time
of
the
bourbons
but
with
a
woman
who
was
worth
a
hundred
thousand
of
silence
paul
it
is
impossible
for
any
woman
to
surpass
this
girl
she
is
like
the
cat
who
rubs
herself
against
your
legs
a
white
girl
with
hair
delicate
in
appearance
but
who
must
have
downy
threads
on
the
third
phalanx
of
her
fingers
and
all
along
her
cheeks
a
white
down
whose
line
luminous
on
fine
days
begins
at
her
ears
and
loses
itself
on
her
ah
the
other
my
dear
de
marsay
she
has
black
eyes
which
have
never
wept
but
which
burn
black
eyebrows
which
meet
and
give
her
an
air
of
hardness
contradicted
by
the
compact
curve
of
her
lips
on
which
the
kisses
do
not
stay
lips
burning
and
fresh
a
moorish
color
that
warms
a
man
like
the
sun
but
upon
my
word
of
honor
she
is
like
you
you
flatter
her
a
firm
figure
the
tapering
figure
of
a
corvette
built
for
speed
which
rushes
down
upon
the
merchant
vessel
with
french
impetuosity
which
grapples
with
her
and
sinks
her
at
the
same
after
all
my
dear
fellow
answered
de
marsay
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
me
since
i
have
never
seen
her
ever
since
i
have
studied
women
my
incognita
is
the
only
one
whose
virginal
bosom
whose
ardent
and
voluptuous
forms
have
realized
for
me
the
only
woman
of
my
dreams
of
my
dreams
she
is
the
original
of
that
ravishing
picture
called
femme
caressant
sa
the
warmest
the
most
infernal
inspiration
of
the
genius
of
antiquity
a
holy
poem
prostituted
by
those
who
have
copied
it
for
frescoes
and
mosiacs
for
a
heap
of
bourgeois
who
see
in
this
gem
nothing
more
than
a
and
hang
it
on
their
whereas
it
is
the
whole
woman
an
abyss
of
pleasure
into
which
one
plunges
and
finds
no
end
whereas
it
is
the
ideal
woman
to
be
seen
sometimes
in
reality
in
spain
or
italy
almost
never
in
france
well
i
have
again
seen
this
girl
of
the
gold
eyes
this
woman
caressing
her
chimera
i
saw
her
on
friday
i
had
a
presentiment
that
on
the
following
day
she
would
be
here
at
the
same
hour
i
was
not
mistaken
i
have
taken
a
pleasure
in
following
her
without
being
observed
in
studying
her
indolent
walk
the
walk
of
the
woman
without
occupation
but
in
the
movements
of
which
one
devines
all
the
pleasure
that
lies
asleep
well
she
turned
back
again
she
saw
me
once
more
she
adored
me
once
more
trembled
shivered
it
was
then
i
noticed
the
genuine
spanish
duenna
who
looked
after
her
a
hyena
upon
whom
some
jealous
man
has
put
a
dress
a
well
paid
no
doubt
to
guard
this
delicious
creature
ah
then
the
duenna
made
me
deeper
in
love
i
grew
curious
on
saturday
nobody
and
here
i
am
waiting
for
this
girl
whose
chimera
i
am
asking
nothing
better
than
to
pose
as
the
monster
in
the
there
she
is
said
paul
every
one
is
turning
round
to
look
at
the
unknown
blushed
her
eyes
shone
she
saw
henri
she
shut
them
and
passed
by
you
say
that
she
notices
you
cried
paul
facetiously
the
duenna
looked
fixedly
and
attentively
at
the
two
young
men
when
the
unknown
and
henri
passed
each
other
again
the
young
girl
touched
him
and
with
her
hand
pressed
the
hand
of
the
young
man
then
she
turned
her
head
and
smiled
with
passion
but
the
duenna
led
her
away
very
quickly
to
the
gate
of
the
rue
de
castiglione
the
two
friends
followed
the
young
girl
admiring
the
magnificent
grace
of
the
neck
which
met
her
head
in
a
harmony
of
vigorous
lines
and
upon
which
a
few
coils
of
hair
were
tightly
wound
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
had
that
arched
slender
foot
which
presents
so
many
attractions
to
the
dainty
imagination
moreover
she
was
shod
with
elegance
and
wore
a
short
skirt
during
her
course
she
turned
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
henri
and
appeared
to
follow
the
old
woman
regretfully
seeming
to
be
at
once
her
mistress
and
her
slave
she
could
break
her
with
blows
but
could
not
dismiss
her
all
that
was
perceptible
the
two
friends
reached
the
gate
two
men
in
livery
let
down
the
step
of
a
tasteful
emblazoned
with
armorial
bearings
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
was
the
first
to
enter
it
took
her
seat
at
the
side
where
she
could
be
best
seen
when
the
carriage
turned
put
her
hand
on
the
door
and
waved
her
handkerchief
in
the
duennna
s
despite
in
contempt
of
what
might
be
said
by
the
curious
her
handkerchief
cried
to
henri
openly
follow
me
have
you
ever
seen
a
handkerchief
better
thrown
said
henri
to
paul
de
manerville
then
observing
a
fiacre
on
the
point
of
departure
having
just
set
down
a
fare
he
made
a
sign
to
the
driver
to
wait
follow
that
carriage
notice
the
house
and
the
street
where
it
stops
you
shall
have
ten
francs
paul
the
cab
followed
the
the
stopped
in
the
rue
saint
lazare
before
one
of
the
finest
houses
of
the
neighborhood
de
marsay
was
not
impulsive
any
other
young
man
would
have
obeyed
his
impulse
to
obtain
at
once
some
information
about
a
girl
who
realized
so
fully
the
most
luminous
ideas
ever
expressed
upon
women
in
the
poetry
of
the
east
but
too
experienced
to
compromise
his
good
fortune
he
had
told
his
coachman
to
continue
along
the
rue
saint
lazare
and
carry
him
back
to
his
house
the
next
day
his
confidential
valet
laurent
by
name
as
cunning
a
fellow
as
the
frontin
of
the
old
comedy
waited
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
inhabited
by
the
unknown
for
the
hour
at
which
letters
were
distributed
in
order
to
be
able
to
spy
at
his
ease
and
hang
about
the
house
he
had
followed
the
example
of
those
police
officers
who
seek
a
good
disguise
and
bought
up
clothes
of
an
auvergnat
the
appearance
of
whom
he
sought
to
imitate
when
the
postman
who
went
the
round
of
the
rue
saint
lazare
that
morning
passed
by
laurent
feigned
to
be
a
porter
unable
to
remember
the
name
of
a
person
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
a
parcel
and
consulted
the
postman
deceived
at
first
by
appearances
this
personage
so
picturesque
in
the
midst
of
parisian
civilization
informed
him
that
the
house
in
which
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
dwelt
belonged
to
don
hijos
marquis
de
grandee
of
spain
naturally
it
was
not
with
the
marquis
that
the
auvergnat
was
concerned
my
parcel
he
said
is
for
the
she
is
away
replied
the
postman
her
letters
are
forwarded
to
then
the
marquise
is
not
a
young
girl
who
ah
said
the
postman
interrupting
the
de
and
observing
him
attentively
you
are
as
much
a
porter
as
i
m
laurent
chinked
some
pieces
of
gold
before
the
functionary
who
began
to
smile
come
here
s
the
name
of
your
quarry
he
said
taking
from
his
leather
wallet
a
letter
bearing
a
london
stamp
upon
which
the
address
to
mademoiselle
paquita
valdes
rue
saint
lazare
hotel
paris
was
written
in
long
fine
characters
which
spoke
of
a
woman
s
hand
could
you
tap
a
bottle
of
chablis
with
a
few
dozen
oysters
and
a
with
mushrooms
to
follow
it
said
laurent
who
wished
to
win
the
postman
s
valuable
friendship
at
nine
when
my
round
is
finished
where
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
antin
and
the
rue
at
the
sans
said
laurent
hark
ye
my
friend
said
the
postman
when
he
rejoined
the
valet
an
hour
after
this
encounter
if
your
master
is
in
love
with
the
girl
he
is
in
for
a
famous
task
i
doubt
you
ll
not
succeed
in
seeing
her
in
the
ten
years
that
i
ve
been
postman
in
paris
i
have
seen
plenty
of
different
kinds
of
doors
but
i
can
tell
you
and
no
fear
of
being
called
a
liar
by
any
of
my
comrades
there
never
was
a
door
so
mysterious
as
de
s
no
one
can
get
into
the
house
without
the
lord
knows
what
and
notice
it
has
been
selected
on
purpose
between
a
courtyard
and
a
garden
to
avoid
any
communication
with
other
houses
the
porter
is
an
old
spaniard
who
never
speaks
a
word
of
french
but
peers
at
people
as
vidocq
might
to
see
if
they
are
not
thieves
if
a
lover
a
thief
or
you
i
make
no
comparisons
could
get
the
better
of
this
first
wicket
well
in
the
first
hall
which
is
shut
by
a
glazed
door
you
would
run
across
a
butler
surrounded
by
lackeys
an
old
joker
more
savage
and
surly
even
than
the
porter
if
any
one
gets
past
the
porter
s
lodge
my
butler
comes
out
waits
for
you
at
the
entrance
and
puts
you
through
a
like
a
criminal
that
has
happened
to
me
a
mere
postman
he
took
me
for
an
eavesdropper
in
disguise
he
said
laughing
at
his
nonsense
as
for
the
servants
don
t
hope
to
get
aught
out
of
them
i
think
they
are
mutes
no
one
in
the
neighborhood
knows
the
color
of
their
speech
i
don
t
know
what
wages
they
can
pay
them
to
keep
them
from
talk
and
drink
the
fact
is
they
are
not
to
be
got
at
whether
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
shot
or
that
they
have
some
enormous
sum
to
lose
in
the
case
of
an
indiscretion
if
your
master
is
fond
enough
of
mademoiselle
paquita
valdes
to
surmount
all
these
obstacles
he
certainly
won
t
triumph
over
dona
concha
marialva
the
duenna
who
accompanies
her
and
would
put
her
under
her
petticoats
sooner
than
leave
her
the
two
women
look
as
if
they
were
sewn
to
one
all
that
you
say
worthy
postman
went
on
laurent
after
having
drunk
off
his
wine
confirms
me
in
what
i
have
learned
before
upon
my
word
i
thought
they
were
making
fun
of
me
the
fruiterer
opposite
told
me
that
of
nights
they
let
loose
dogs
whose
food
is
hung
up
on
stakes
just
out
of
their
reach
these
cursed
animals
think
therefore
that
any
one
likely
to
come
in
has
designs
on
their
victuals
and
would
tear
one
to
pieces
you
will
tell
me
one
might
throw
them
down
pieces
but
it
seems
they
have
been
trained
to
touch
nothing
except
from
the
hand
of
the
the
porter
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
whose
garden
joins
at
the
top
that
of
the
hotel
told
me
the
same
thing
replied
the
postman
good
my
master
knows
him
said
laurent
to
himself
do
you
know
he
went
on
leering
at
the
postman
i
serve
a
master
who
is
a
rare
man
and
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
kiss
the
sole
of
the
foot
of
an
empress
she
would
have
to
give
in
to
him
if
he
had
need
of
you
which
is
what
i
wish
for
you
for
he
is
generous
could
one
count
on
you
lord
monsieur
laurent
my
name
is
moinot
my
name
is
written
exactly
like
magpie
exactly
said
laurent
i
live
at
no
rue
des
trois
freres
on
the
fifth
floor
went
on
moinot
i
have
a
wife
and
four
children
if
what
you
want
of
me
doesn
t
transgress
the
limits
of
my
conscience
and
my
official
duties
you
understand
i
am
your
you
are
an
honest
fellow
said
laurent
shaking
his
hand
paquita
valdes
is
no
doubt
the
mistress
of
the
marquis
de
the
friend
of
king
ferdinand
only
an
old
spanish
mummy
of
eighty
years
is
capable
of
taking
such
precautions
said
henri
when
his
de
had
related
the
result
of
his
researches
monsieur
said
laurent
unless
he
takes
a
balloon
no
one
can
get
into
that
you
are
a
fool
is
it
necessary
to
get
into
the
hotel
to
have
paquita
when
paquita
can
get
out
of
it
but
sir
the
duenna
we
will
shut
her
up
for
a
day
or
two
your
so
we
shall
have
paquita
said
laurent
rubbing
his
hands
rascal
answered
henri
i
shall
condemn
you
to
the
concha
if
you
carry
your
impudence
so
far
as
to
speak
so
of
a
woman
before
she
has
become
mine
turn
your
thoughts
to
dressing
me
i
am
going
henri
remained
for
a
moment
plunged
in
joyous
reflections
let
us
say
it
to
the
praise
of
women
he
obtained
all
those
whom
he
deigned
to
desire
and
what
could
one
think
of
a
woman
having
no
lover
who
should
have
known
how
to
resist
a
young
man
armed
with
beauty
which
is
the
intelligence
of
the
body
with
intelligence
which
is
a
grace
of
the
soul
armed
with
moral
force
and
fortune
which
are
the
only
two
real
powers
yet
in
triumphing
with
such
ease
de
marsay
was
bound
to
grow
weary
of
his
triumphs
thus
for
about
two
years
he
had
grown
very
weary
indeed
and
diving
deep
into
the
sea
of
pleasures
he
brought
back
more
grit
than
pearls
thus
had
he
come
like
potentates
to
implore
of
chance
some
obstacle
to
surmount
some
enterprise
which
should
ask
the
employment
of
his
dormant
moral
and
physical
strength
although
paquita
valdes
presented
him
with
a
marvelous
concentration
of
perfections
which
he
had
only
yet
enjoyed
in
detail
the
attraction
of
passion
was
almost
with
him
constant
satiety
had
weakened
in
his
heart
the
sentiment
of
love
like
old
men
and
people
disillusioned
he
had
no
longer
anything
but
extravagant
caprices
ruinous
tastes
fantasies
which
once
satisfied
left
no
pleasant
memory
in
his
heart
amongst
young
people
love
is
the
finest
of
the
emotions
it
makes
the
life
of
the
soul
blossom
it
nourishes
by
its
solar
power
the
finest
inspirations
and
their
great
thoughts
the
first
fruits
in
all
things
have
a
delicious
savor
amongst
men
love
becomes
a
passion
strength
leads
to
abuse
amongst
old
men
it
turns
to
vice
impotence
tends
to
extremes
henri
was
at
once
an
old
man
a
man
and
a
youth
to
afford
him
the
feelings
of
a
real
love
he
needed
like
lovelace
a
clarissa
harlowe
without
the
magic
lustre
of
that
unattainable
pearl
he
could
only
have
either
passions
rendered
acute
by
some
parisian
vanity
or
set
determinations
with
himself
to
bring
such
and
such
a
woman
to
such
and
such
a
point
of
corruption
or
else
adventures
which
stimulated
his
curiosity
the
report
of
laurent
his
de
had
just
given
an
enormous
value
to
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
it
was
a
question
of
doing
battle
with
some
secret
enemy
who
seemed
as
dangerous
as
he
was
cunning
and
to
carry
off
the
victory
all
the
forces
which
henri
could
dispose
of
would
be
useful
he
was
about
to
play
in
that
eternal
old
comedy
which
will
be
always
fresh
and
the
characters
in
which
are
an
old
man
a
young
girl
and
a
lover
don
hijos
paquita
de
marsay
if
laurent
was
the
equal
of
figaro
the
duenna
seemed
incorruptible
thus
the
living
play
was
supplied
by
chance
with
a
stronger
plot
than
it
had
ever
been
by
dramatic
author
but
then
is
not
chance
too
a
man
of
genius
it
must
be
a
cautious
game
said
henri
to
himself
well
said
paul
de
manerville
as
he
entered
the
room
how
are
we
getting
on
i
have
come
to
breakfast
with
so
be
it
said
henri
you
won
t
be
shocked
if
i
make
my
toilette
before
you
how
absurd
we
take
so
many
things
from
the
english
just
now
that
we
might
well
become
as
great
prudes
and
hypocrites
as
themselves
said
henri
laurent
had
set
before
his
master
such
a
quantity
of
utensils
so
many
different
articles
of
such
elegance
that
paul
could
not
refrain
from
saying
but
you
will
take
a
couple
of
hours
over
that
no
said
henri
two
hours
and
a
well
then
since
we
are
by
ourselves
and
can
say
what
we
like
explain
to
me
why
a
man
as
superior
as
yourself
for
you
are
superior
should
affect
to
exaggerate
a
foppery
which
can
not
be
natural
why
spend
two
hours
and
a
half
in
adorning
yourself
when
it
is
sufficient
to
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
your
bath
to
do
your
hair
in
two
minutes
and
to
dress
there
tell
me
your
i
must
be
very
fond
of
you
my
good
dunce
to
confide
such
high
thoughts
to
you
said
the
young
man
who
was
at
that
moment
having
his
feet
rubbed
with
a
soft
brush
lathered
with
english
soap
have
i
not
the
most
devoted
attachment
to
you
replied
paul
de
manerville
and
do
i
not
like
you
because
i
know
your
superiority
you
must
have
noticed
if
you
are
in
the
least
capable
of
observing
any
moral
fact
that
women
love
fops
went
on
de
marsay
without
replying
in
any
way
to
paul
s
declaration
except
by
a
look
do
you
know
why
women
love
fops
my
friend
fops
are
the
only
men
who
take
care
of
themselves
now
to
take
excessive
care
of
oneself
does
it
not
imply
that
one
takes
care
in
oneself
of
what
belongs
to
another
the
man
who
does
not
belong
to
himself
is
precisely
the
man
on
whom
women
are
keen
love
is
essentially
a
thief
i
say
nothing
about
that
excess
of
niceness
to
which
they
are
so
devoted
do
you
know
of
any
woman
who
has
had
a
passion
for
a
sloven
even
if
he
were
a
remarkable
man
if
such
a
fact
has
occurred
we
must
put
it
to
the
account
of
those
morbid
affections
of
the
breeding
woman
mad
fancies
which
float
through
the
minds
of
everybody
on
the
other
hand
i
have
seen
most
remarkable
people
left
in
the
lurch
because
of
their
carelessness
a
fop
who
is
concerned
about
his
person
is
concerned
with
folly
with
petty
things
and
what
is
a
woman
a
petty
thing
a
bundle
of
follies
with
two
words
said
to
the
winds
can
you
not
make
her
busy
for
four
hours
she
is
sure
that
the
fop
will
be
occupied
with
her
seeing
that
he
has
no
mind
for
great
things
she
will
never
be
neglected
for
glory
ambition
politics
art
those
prostitutes
who
for
her
are
rivals
then
fops
have
the
courage
to
cover
themselves
with
ridicule
in
order
to
please
a
woman
and
her
heart
is
full
of
gratitude
towards
the
man
who
is
ridiculous
for
love
in
fine
a
fop
can
be
no
fop
unless
he
is
right
in
being
one
it
is
women
who
bestow
that
rank
the
fop
is
love
s
colonel
he
has
his
victories
his
regiment
of
women
at
his
command
my
dear
fellow
in
paris
everything
is
known
and
a
man
can
not
be
a
fop
there
you
who
have
only
one
woman
and
who
perhaps
are
right
to
have
but
one
try
to
act
the
fop
you
will
not
even
become
ridiculous
you
will
be
dead
you
will
become
a
foregone
conclusion
one
of
those
men
condemned
inevitably
to
do
one
and
the
same
thing
you
will
come
to
signify
as
inseparably
as
de
la
fayette
signifies
de
talleyrand
desaugiers
de
segur
if
they
once
forsake
their
own
line
people
no
longer
attach
any
value
to
what
they
do
so
foppery
my
friend
paul
is
the
sign
of
an
incontestable
power
over
the
female
folk
a
man
who
is
loved
by
many
women
passes
for
having
superior
qualities
and
then
poor
fellow
it
is
a
question
who
shall
have
him
but
do
you
think
it
is
nothing
to
have
the
right
of
going
into
a
of
looking
down
at
people
from
over
your
cravat
or
through
your
and
of
despising
the
most
superior
of
men
should
he
wear
an
waistcoat
laurent
you
are
hurting
me
after
breakfast
paul
we
will
go
to
the
tuileries
and
see
the
adorable
girl
with
the
golden
when
after
making
an
excellent
meal
the
two
young
men
had
traversed
the
terrasse
de
feuillants
and
the
broad
walk
of
the
tuileries
they
nowhere
discovered
the
sublime
paquita
valdes
on
whose
account
some
fifty
of
the
most
elegant
young
men
in
paris
where
to
be
seen
all
scented
with
their
high
scarfs
spurred
and
booted
riding
walking
talking
laughing
and
damning
themselves
mightily
it
s
a
white
mass
said
henri
but
i
have
the
most
excellent
idea
in
the
world
this
girl
receives
letters
from
london
the
postman
must
be
bought
or
made
drunk
a
letter
opened
read
of
course
and
a
slipped
in
before
it
is
sealed
up
again
the
old
tyrant
is
certain
to
know
the
person
who
writes
the
letters
from
london
and
has
ceased
to
be
suspicious
of
the
day
after
de
marsay
came
again
to
walk
on
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
and
saw
paquita
valdes
already
passion
had
embellished
her
for
him
seriously
he
was
wild
for
those
eyes
whose
rays
seemed
akin
to
those
which
the
sun
emits
and
whose
ardor
set
the
seal
upon
that
of
her
perfect
body
in
which
all
was
delight
de
marsay
was
on
fire
to
brush
the
dress
of
this
enchanting
girl
as
they
passed
one
another
in
their
walk
but
his
attempts
were
always
vain
but
at
one
moment
when
he
had
repassed
paquita
and
the
duenna
in
order
to
find
himself
on
the
same
side
as
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
when
he
returned
paquita
no
less
impatient
came
forward
hurriedly
and
de
marsay
felt
his
hand
pressed
by
her
in
a
fashion
at
once
so
swift
and
so
passionately
significant
that
it
was
as
though
he
had
received
the
emotions
surged
up
in
his
heart
when
the
two
lovers
glanced
at
one
another
paquita
seemed
ashamed
she
dropped
her
eyes
lest
she
should
meet
the
eyes
of
henri
but
her
gaze
sank
lower
to
fasten
on
the
feet
and
form
of
him
whom
women
before
the
revolution
called
i
am
determined
to
make
this
girl
my
mistress
said
henri
to
himself
as
he
followed
her
along
the
terrace
in
the
direction
of
the
place
louis
he
caught
sight
of
the
aged
marquis
de
who
was
walking
on
the
arm
of
his
valet
stepping
with
all
the
precautions
due
to
gout
and
decrepitude
dona
concha
who
distrusted
henri
made
paquita
pass
between
herself
and
the
old
man
oh
for
you
said
de
marsay
to
himself
casting
a
glance
of
disdain
upon
the
duenna
if
one
can
not
make
you
capitulate
with
a
little
opium
one
can
make
you
sleep
we
know
mythology
and
the
fable
of
before
entering
the
carriage
the
girl
exchanged
certain
glances
with
her
lover
of
which
the
meaning
was
unmistakable
and
which
enchanted
henri
but
one
of
them
was
surprised
by
the
duenna
she
said
a
few
rapid
words
to
paquita
who
threw
herself
into
the
with
an
air
of
desperation
for
some
days
paquita
did
not
appear
in
the
tuileries
laurent
who
by
his
master
s
orders
was
on
watch
by
the
hotel
learned
from
the
neighbors
that
neither
the
two
women
nor
the
aged
marquis
had
been
abroad
since
the
day
upon
which
the
duenna
had
surprised
a
glance
between
the
young
girl
in
her
charge
and
henri
the
bond
so
flimsy
withal
which
united
the
two
lovers
was
already
severed
some
days
later
none
knew
by
what
means
de
marsay
had
attained
his
end
he
had
a
seal
and
wax
exactly
resembling
the
seal
and
wax
affixed
to
the
letters
sent
to
mademoiselle
valdes
from
london
paper
similar
to
that
which
her
correspondent
used
moreover
all
the
implements
and
stamps
necessary
to
affix
the
french
and
english
postmarks
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
which
he
gave
all
the
appearances
of
a
letter
sent
from
london
my
dear
paquita
i
shall
not
try
to
paint
to
you
in
words
the
passion
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
if
to
my
happiness
you
reciprocate
it
understand
that
i
have
found
a
means
of
corresponding
with
you
my
name
is
adolphe
de
gouges
and
i
live
at
no
rue
de
l
universite
if
you
are
too
closely
watched
to
be
able
to
write
to
me
if
you
have
neither
pen
nor
paper
i
shall
understand
it
by
your
silence
if
then
you
have
not
between
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
thrown
a
letter
over
the
wall
of
your
garden
into
that
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
where
it
will
be
waited
for
during
the
whole
of
the
day
a
man
who
is
entirely
devoted
to
me
will
let
down
two
flasks
by
a
string
over
your
wall
at
ten
o
clock
the
next
morning
be
walking
there
at
that
hour
one
of
the
two
flasks
will
contain
opium
to
send
your
argus
to
sleep
it
will
be
sufficient
to
employ
six
drops
the
other
will
contain
ink
the
flask
of
ink
is
of
cut
glass
the
other
is
plain
both
are
of
such
a
size
as
can
easily
be
concealed
within
your
bosom
all
that
i
have
already
done
in
order
to
be
able
to
correspond
with
you
should
tell
you
how
greatly
i
love
you
should
you
have
any
doubt
of
it
i
will
confess
to
you
that
to
obtain
an
interview
of
one
hour
with
you
i
would
give
my
at
least
they
believe
that
poor
creatures
said
de
marsay
but
they
are
right
what
should
we
think
of
a
woman
who
refused
to
be
beguiled
by
a
accompanied
by
such
convincing
accessories
this
letter
was
delivered
by
master
moinot
postman
on
the
following
day
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
the
porter
of
the
hotel
in
order
to
be
nearer
to
the
field
of
action
de
marsay
went
and
breakfasted
with
paul
who
lived
in
the
rue
de
la
pepiniere
at
two
o
clock
just
as
the
two
friends
were
laughingly
discussing
the
discomfiture
of
a
young
man
who
had
attempted
to
lead
the
life
of
fashion
without
a
settled
income
and
were
devising
an
end
for
him
henri
s
coachman
came
to
seek
his
master
at
paul
s
house
and
presented
to
him
a
mysterious
personage
who
insisted
on
speaking
himself
with
his
master
this
individual
was
a
mulatto
who
would
assuredly
have
given
talma
a
model
for
the
part
of
othello
if
he
had
come
across
him
never
did
any
african
face
better
express
the
grand
vengefulness
the
ready
suspicion
the
promptitude
in
the
execution
of
a
thought
the
strength
of
the
moor
and
his
childish
lack
of
reflection
his
black
eyes
had
the
fixity
of
the
eyes
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
they
were
framed
like
a
vulture
s
by
a
bluish
membrane
devoid
of
lashes
his
forehead
low
and
narrow
had
something
menacing
evidently
this
man
was
under
the
yoke
of
some
single
and
unique
thought
his
sinewy
arm
did
not
belong
to
him
he
was
followed
by
a
man
whom
the
imaginations
of
all
folk
from
those
who
shiver
in
greenland
to
those
who
sweat
in
the
tropics
would
paint
in
the
single
phrase
was
an
unfortunate
from
this
phrase
everybody
will
conceive
him
according
to
the
special
ideas
of
each
country
but
who
can
best
imagine
his
face
white
and
wrinkled
red
at
the
extremities
and
his
long
beard
who
will
see
his
lean
and
yellow
scarf
his
greasy
his
battered
hat
his
green
frock
coat
his
deplorable
trousers
his
dilapidated
waistcoat
his
imitation
gold
pin
and
battered
shoes
the
strings
of
which
were
plastered
in
mud
who
will
see
all
that
but
the
parisian
the
unfortunate
man
of
paris
is
the
unfortunate
man
for
he
has
still
enough
mirth
to
know
the
extent
of
his
misfortune
the
mulatto
was
like
an
executioner
of
louis
xi
leading
a
man
to
the
gallows
who
has
hunted
us
out
these
two
extraordinary
creatures
said
henri
faith
there
is
one
of
them
who
makes
me
shudder
replied
paul
who
are
you
you
fellow
who
look
the
most
like
a
christian
of
the
two
said
henri
looking
at
the
unfortunate
man
the
mulatto
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
two
young
men
like
a
man
who
understood
nothing
and
who
sought
no
less
to
divine
something
from
the
gestures
and
movements
of
the
lips
i
am
a
public
scribe
and
interpreter
i
live
at
the
palais
de
justice
and
am
named
good
and
this
one
said
henri
to
poincet
looking
towards
the
mulatto
i
do
not
know
he
only
speaks
a
sort
of
spanish
and
he
has
brought
me
here
to
make
himself
understood
by
the
mulatto
drew
from
his
pocket
the
letter
which
henri
had
written
to
paquita
and
handed
it
to
him
henri
threw
it
in
the
fire
ah
so
the
game
is
beginning
said
henri
to
himself
paul
leave
us
alone
for
a
i
translated
this
letter
for
him
went
on
the
interpreter
when
they
were
alone
when
it
was
translated
he
was
in
some
place
which
i
don
t
remember
then
he
came
back
to
look
for
me
and
promised
me
two
to
fetch
him
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
nigger
asked
henri
i
did
not
translate
said
the
interpreter
waiting
for
the
mulatto
s
reply
he
said
sir
went
on
the
interpreter
after
having
listened
to
the
unknown
that
you
must
be
at
ten
night
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
near
the
cafe
you
will
see
a
carriage
there
in
which
you
must
take
your
place
saying
to
the
man
who
will
wait
to
open
the
door
for
you
the
word
a
spanish
word
which
means
added
poincet
casting
a
glance
of
congratulation
upon
henri
the
mulatto
was
about
to
bestow
the
two
but
de
marsay
would
not
permit
it
and
himself
rewarded
the
interpreter
as
he
was
paying
him
the
mulatto
began
to
speak
what
is
he
saying
he
is
warning
me
replied
the
unfortunate
that
if
i
commit
a
single
indiscretion
he
will
strangle
me
he
speaks
fair
and
he
looks
remarkably
as
if
he
were
capable
of
carrying
out
his
i
am
sure
of
it
answered
henri
he
would
keep
his
he
says
as
well
replied
the
interpreter
that
the
person
from
whom
he
is
sent
implores
you
for
your
sake
and
for
hers
to
act
with
the
greatest
prudence
because
the
daggers
which
are
raised
above
your
head
would
strike
your
heart
before
any
human
power
could
save
you
from
he
said
that
so
much
the
better
it
will
be
more
amusing
you
can
come
in
now
paul
he
cried
to
his
friend
the
mulatto
who
had
not
ceased
to
gaze
at
the
lover
of
paquita
valdes
with
magnetic
attention
went
away
followed
by
the
interpreter
well
at
last
i
have
an
adventure
which
is
entirely
romantic
said
henri
when
paul
returned
after
having
shared
in
a
certain
number
i
have
finished
by
finding
in
paris
an
intrigue
accompanied
by
serious
accidents
by
grave
perils
the
deuce
what
courage
danger
gives
a
woman
to
torment
a
woman
to
try
and
contradict
her
doesn
t
it
give
her
the
right
and
the
courage
to
scale
in
one
moment
obstacles
which
it
would
take
her
years
to
surmount
of
herself
pretty
creature
jump
then
to
die
poor
child
daggers
oh
imagination
of
women
they
can
not
help
trying
to
find
authority
for
their
little
jests
besides
can
one
think
of
it
paquita
can
one
think
of
it
my
child
the
devil
take
me
now
that
i
know
this
beautiful
girl
this
masterpiece
of
nature
is
mine
the
adventure
has
lost
its
for
all
his
light
words
the
youth
in
henri
had
reappeared
in
order
to
live
until
the
morrow
without
too
much
pain
he
had
recourse
to
exorbitant
pleasure
he
played
dined
supped
with
his
friends
he
drank
like
a
fish
ate
like
a
german
and
won
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
he
left
the
rocher
de
cancale
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
slept
like
a
child
awoke
the
next
morning
fresh
and
rosy
and
dressed
to
go
to
the
tuileries
with
the
intention
of
taking
a
ride
after
having
seen
paquita
in
order
to
get
himself
an
appetite
and
dine
the
better
and
so
kill
the
time
at
the
hour
mentioned
henri
was
on
the
boulevard
saw
the
carriage
and
gave
the
to
a
man
who
looked
to
him
like
the
mulatto
hearing
the
word
the
man
opened
the
door
and
quickly
let
down
the
step
henri
was
so
rapidly
carried
through
paris
and
his
thoughts
left
him
so
little
capacity
to
pay
attention
to
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
that
he
did
not
know
where
the
carriage
stopped
the
mulatto
let
him
into
a
house
the
staircase
of
which
was
quite
close
to
the
entrance
this
staircase
was
dark
as
was
also
the
landing
upon
which
henri
was
obliged
to
wait
while
the
mulatto
was
opening
the
door
of
a
damp
apartment
fetid
and
unlit
the
chambers
of
which
barely
illuminated
by
the
candle
which
his
guide
found
in
the
seemed
to
him
empty
and
ill
furnished
like
those
of
a
house
the
inhabitants
of
which
are
away
he
recognized
the
sensation
which
he
had
experienced
from
the
perusal
of
one
of
those
romances
of
anne
radcliffe
in
which
the
hero
traverses
the
cold
sombre
and
uninhabited
saloons
of
some
sad
and
desert
spot
at
last
the
mulatto
opened
the
door
of
a
the
condition
of
the
old
furniture
and
the
dilapidated
curtains
with
which
the
room
was
adorned
gave
it
the
air
of
the
of
a
house
of
ill
fame
there
was
the
same
pretension
to
elegance
and
the
same
collection
of
things
in
bad
taste
of
dust
and
dirt
upon
a
sofa
covered
with
red
utrecht
velvet
by
the
side
of
a
smoking
hearth
the
fire
of
which
was
buried
in
ashes
sat
an
old
poorly
dressed
woman
her
head
capped
by
one
of
those
turbans
which
english
women
of
a
certain
age
have
invented
and
which
would
have
a
mighty
success
in
china
where
the
artist
s
ideal
is
the
monstrous
the
room
the
old
woman
the
cold
hearth
all
would
have
chilled
love
to
death
had
not
paquita
been
there
upon
an
ottoman
in
a
loose
voluptuous
wrapper
free
to
scatter
her
gaze
of
gold
and
flame
free
to
show
her
arched
foot
free
of
her
luminous
movements
this
first
interview
was
what
every
must
be
between
persons
of
passionate
disposition
who
have
stepped
over
a
wide
distance
quickly
who
desire
each
other
ardently
and
who
nevertheless
do
not
know
each
other
it
is
impossible
that
at
first
there
should
not
occur
certain
discordant
notes
in
the
situation
which
is
embarrassing
until
the
moment
when
two
souls
find
themselves
in
unison
if
desire
gives
a
man
boldness
and
disposes
him
to
lay
restraint
aside
the
mistress
under
pain
of
ceasing
to
be
woman
however
great
may
be
her
love
is
afraid
of
arriving
at
the
end
so
promptly
and
face
to
face
with
the
necessity
of
giving
herself
which
to
many
women
is
equivalent
to
a
fall
into
an
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
they
know
not
what
they
shall
find
the
involuntary
coldness
of
the
woman
contrasts
with
her
confessed
passion
and
necessarily
reacts
upon
the
most
passionate
lover
thus
ideas
which
often
float
around
souls
like
vapors
determine
in
them
a
sort
of
temporary
malady
in
the
sweet
journey
which
two
beings
undertake
through
the
fair
domains
of
love
this
moment
is
like
a
waste
land
to
be
traversed
a
land
without
a
tree
alternatively
damp
and
warm
full
of
scorching
sand
traversed
by
marshes
which
leads
to
smiling
groves
clad
with
roses
where
love
and
his
retinue
of
pleasures
disport
themselves
on
carpets
of
soft
verdure
often
the
witty
man
finds
himself
afflicted
with
a
foolish
laugh
which
is
his
only
answer
to
everything
his
wit
is
as
it
were
suffocated
beneath
the
icy
pressure
of
his
desires
it
would
not
be
impossible
for
two
beings
of
equal
beauty
intelligence
and
passion
to
utter
at
first
nothing
but
the
most
silly
commonplaces
until
chance
a
word
the
tremor
of
a
certain
glance
the
communication
of
a
spark
should
have
brought
them
to
the
happy
transition
which
leads
to
that
flowery
way
in
which
one
does
not
walk
but
where
one
sways
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
lapse
such
a
state
of
mind
is
always
in
proportion
with
the
violence
of
the
feeling
two
creatures
who
love
one
another
weakly
feel
nothing
similar
the
effect
of
this
crisis
can
even
be
compared
with
that
which
is
produced
by
the
glow
of
a
clear
sky
nature
at
the
first
view
appears
to
be
covered
with
a
gauze
veil
the
azure
of
the
firmament
seems
black
the
intensity
of
light
is
like
darkness
with
henri
as
with
the
spanish
girl
there
was
an
equal
intensity
of
feeling
and
that
law
of
statics
in
virtue
of
which
two
identical
forces
cancel
each
other
might
have
been
true
also
in
the
moral
order
and
the
embarrassment
of
the
moment
was
singularly
increased
by
the
presence
of
the
old
hag
love
takes
pleasure
or
fright
at
all
all
has
meaning
for
it
everything
is
an
omen
of
happiness
or
sorrow
for
it
this
decrepit
woman
was
there
like
a
suggestion
of
catastrophe
and
represented
the
horrid
fish
s
tail
with
which
the
allegorical
geniuses
of
greece
have
terminated
their
chimeras
and
sirens
whose
figures
like
all
passions
are
so
seductive
so
deceptive
although
henri
was
not
a
the
phrase
is
always
a
mockery
but
a
man
of
extraordinary
power
a
man
as
great
as
a
man
can
be
without
faith
the
conjunction
struck
him
moreover
the
strongest
men
are
naturally
the
most
impressionable
and
consequently
the
most
superstitious
if
indeed
one
may
call
superstition
the
prejudice
of
the
first
thoughts
which
without
doubt
is
the
appreciation
of
the
result
in
causes
hidden
to
other
eyes
but
perceptible
to
their
own
the
spanish
girl
profited
by
this
moment
of
stupefaction
to
let
herself
fall
into
the
ecstasy
of
that
infinite
adoration
which
seizes
the
heart
of
a
woman
when
she
truly
loves
and
finds
herself
in
the
presence
of
an
idol
for
whom
she
has
vainly
longed
her
eyes
were
all
joy
all
happiness
and
sparks
flew
from
them
she
was
under
the
charm
and
fearlessly
intoxicated
herself
with
a
felicity
of
which
she
had
dreamed
long
she
seemed
then
so
marvelously
beautiful
to
henri
that
all
this
phantasmagoria
of
rags
and
old
age
of
worn
red
drapery
and
of
the
green
mats
in
front
of
the
armchairs
the
red
tiles
all
this
sick
and
dilapidated
luxury
disappeared
the
room
seemed
lit
up
and
it
was
only
through
a
cloud
that
one
could
see
the
fearful
harpy
fixed
and
dumb
on
her
red
sofa
her
yellow
eyes
betraying
the
servile
sentiments
inspired
by
misfortune
or
caused
by
some
vice
beneath
whose
servitude
one
has
fallen
as
beneath
a
tyrant
who
brutalizes
one
with
the
flagellations
of
his
despotism
her
eyes
had
the
cold
glitter
of
a
caged
tiger
knowing
his
impotence
and
being
compelled
to
swallow
his
rage
of
destruction
who
is
that
woman
said
henri
to
paquita
but
paquita
did
not
answer
she
made
a
sign
that
she
understood
no
french
and
asked
henri
if
he
spoke
english
de
marsay
repeated
his
question
in
english
she
is
the
only
woman
in
whom
i
can
confide
although
she
has
sold
me
already
said
paquita
tranquilly
my
dear
adolphe
she
is
my
mother
a
slave
bought
in
georgia
for
her
rare
beauty
little
enough
of
which
remains
she
only
speaks
her
native
the
attitude
of
this
woman
and
her
eagerness
to
guess
from
the
gestures
of
her
daughter
and
henri
what
was
passing
between
them
were
suddenly
explained
to
the
young
man
and
this
explanation
put
him
at
his
ease
paquita
he
said
are
we
never
to
be
free
then
never
she
said
with
an
air
of
sadness
even
now
we
have
but
a
few
days
before
she
lowered
her
eyes
looked
at
and
counted
with
her
right
hand
on
the
fingers
of
her
left
revealing
so
the
most
beautiful
hands
which
henri
had
ever
seen
one
two
three
she
counted
up
to
twelve
yes
she
said
we
have
twelve
and
after
after
she
said
showing
the
absorption
of
a
weak
woman
before
the
executioner
s
axe
and
slain
in
advance
as
it
were
by
a
fear
which
stripped
her
of
that
magnificent
energy
which
nature
seemed
to
have
bestowed
upon
her
only
to
aggrandize
pleasure
and
convert
the
most
vulgar
delights
into
endless
poems
after
she
repeated
her
eyes
took
a
fixed
stare
she
seemed
to
contemplate
a
threatening
object
far
away
i
do
not
know
she
said
this
girl
is
mad
said
henri
to
himself
falling
into
strange
reflections
paquita
appeared
to
him
occupied
by
something
which
was
not
himself
like
a
woman
constrained
equally
by
remorse
and
passion
perhaps
she
had
in
her
heart
another
love
which
she
alternately
remembered
and
forgot
in
a
moment
henri
was
assailed
by
a
thousand
contradictory
thoughts
this
girl
became
a
mystery
for
him
but
as
he
contemplated
her
with
the
scientific
attention
of
the
man
famished
for
new
pleasures
like
that
eastern
king
who
asked
that
a
pleasure
should
be
created
for
him
a
horrible
thirst
with
which
great
souls
are
seized
henri
recognized
in
paquita
the
richest
organization
that
nature
had
ever
deigned
to
compose
for
love
the
presumptive
play
of
this
machinery
setting
aside
the
soul
would
have
frightened
any
other
man
than
henri
but
he
was
fascinated
by
that
rich
harvest
of
promised
pleasures
by
that
constant
variety
in
happiness
the
dream
of
every
man
and
the
desire
of
every
loving
woman
too
he
was
infuriated
by
the
infinite
rendered
palpable
and
transported
into
the
most
excessive
raptures
of
which
the
creature
is
capable
all
that
he
saw
in
this
girl
more
distinctly
than
he
had
yet
seen
it
for
she
let
herself
be
viewed
complacently
happy
to
be
admired
the
admiration
of
de
marsay
became
a
secret
fury
and
he
unveiled
her
completely
throwing
a
glance
at
her
which
the
spaniard
understood
as
though
she
had
been
used
to
receive
such
if
you
are
not
to
be
mine
mine
only
i
will
kill
you
he
cried
hearing
this
speech
paquita
covered
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
naively
holy
virgin
what
have
i
brought
upon
myself
she
rose
flung
herself
down
upon
the
red
sofa
and
buried
her
head
in
the
rags
which
covered
the
bosom
of
her
mother
and
wept
there
the
old
woman
received
her
daughter
without
issuing
from
her
state
of
immobility
or
displaying
any
emotion
the
mother
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
that
gravity
of
savage
races
the
impassiveness
of
a
statue
upon
which
all
remarks
are
lost
did
she
or
did
she
not
love
her
daughter
beneath
that
mask
every
human
emotion
might
brood
good
and
evil
and
from
this
creature
all
might
be
expected
her
gaze
passed
slowly
from
her
daughter
s
beautiful
hair
which
covered
her
like
a
mantle
to
the
face
of
henri
which
she
considered
with
an
indescribable
curiosity
she
seemed
to
ask
by
what
fatality
he
was
there
from
what
caprice
nature
had
made
so
seductive
a
man
these
women
are
making
sport
of
me
said
henri
to
himself
at
that
moment
paquita
raised
her
head
cast
at
him
one
of
those
looks
which
reach
the
very
soul
and
consume
it
so
beautiful
seemed
she
that
he
swore
he
would
possess
such
a
treasure
of
beauty
my
paquita
be
mine
wouldst
thou
kill
me
she
said
fearfully
palpitating
and
anxious
but
drawn
towards
him
by
an
inexplicable
force
kill
thee
i
he
said
smiling
paquita
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
said
a
word
to
the
old
woman
who
authoritatively
seized
henri
s
hand
and
that
of
her
daughter
she
gazed
at
them
for
a
long
time
and
then
released
them
wagging
her
head
in
a
fashion
horribly
significant
be
mine
this
evening
this
moment
follow
me
do
not
leave
me
it
must
be
paquita
dost
thou
love
me
come
in
a
moment
he
had
poured
out
a
thousand
foolish
words
to
her
with
the
rapidity
of
a
torrent
coursing
between
the
rocks
and
repeating
the
same
sound
in
a
thousand
different
forms
it
is
the
same
voice
said
paquita
in
a
melancholy
voice
which
de
marsay
could
not
overhear
and
the
same
ardor
she
added
so
be
it
yes
she
said
with
an
abandonment
of
passion
which
no
words
can
describe
yes
but
not
adolphe
i
gave
too
little
opium
to
la
concha
she
might
wake
up
and
i
should
be
lost
at
this
moment
the
whole
household
believes
me
to
be
asleep
in
my
room
in
two
days
be
at
the
same
spot
say
the
same
word
to
the
same
man
that
man
is
my
cristemio
worships
me
and
would
die
in
torments
for
me
before
they
could
extract
one
word
against
me
from
him
farewell
she
said
seizing
henri
by
the
waist
and
twining
round
him
like
a
serpent
she
pressed
him
on
every
side
at
once
lifted
her
head
to
his
and
offered
him
her
lips
then
snatched
a
kiss
which
filled
them
both
with
such
a
dizziness
that
it
seemed
to
henri
as
though
the
earth
opened
and
paquita
cried
enough
depart
in
a
voice
which
told
how
little
she
was
mistress
of
herself
but
she
clung
to
him
still
still
crying
depart
and
brought
him
slowly
to
the
staircase
there
the
mulatto
whose
white
eyes
lit
up
at
the
sight
of
paquita
took
the
torch
from
the
hands
of
his
idol
and
conducted
henri
to
the
street
he
left
the
light
under
the
arch
opened
the
door
put
henri
into
the
carriage
and
set
him
down
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
with
marvelous
rapidity
it
was
as
though
the
horses
had
in
their
veins
the
scene
was
like
a
dream
to
de
marsay
but
one
of
those
dreams
which
even
when
they
fade
away
leave
a
feeling
of
supernatural
voluptuousness
which
a
man
runs
after
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
a
single
kiss
had
been
enough
never
had
been
spent
in
a
manner
more
decorous
or
chaste
or
perhaps
more
coldly
in
a
spot
of
which
the
surroundings
were
more
gruesome
in
presence
of
a
more
hideous
divinity
for
the
mother
had
remained
in
henri
s
imagination
like
some
infernal
cowering
thing
cadaverous
monstrous
savagely
ferocious
which
the
imagination
of
poets
and
painters
had
not
yet
conceived
in
effect
no
had
ever
irritated
his
senses
more
revealed
more
audacious
pleasures
or
better
aroused
love
from
its
centre
to
shed
itself
round
him
like
an
atmosphere
there
was
something
sombre
mysterious
sweet
tender
constrained
and
expansive
an
intermingling
of
the
awful
and
the
celestial
of
paradise
and
hell
which
made
de
marsay
like
a
drunken
man
he
was
no
longer
himself
and
he
was
withal
great
enough
to
be
able
to
resist
the
intoxication
of
pleasure
in
order
to
render
his
conduct
intelligible
in
the
catastrophe
of
this
story
it
is
needful
to
explain
how
his
soul
had
broadened
at
an
age
when
young
men
generally
belittle
themselves
in
their
relations
with
women
or
in
too
much
occupation
with
them
its
growth
was
due
to
a
concurrence
of
secret
circumstances
which
invested
him
with
a
vast
and
unsuspected
power
this
young
man
held
in
his
hand
a
sceptre
more
powerful
than
that
of
modern
kings
almost
all
of
whom
are
curbed
in
their
least
wishes
by
the
laws
de
marsay
exercised
the
autocratic
power
of
an
oriental
despot
but
this
power
so
stupidly
put
into
execution
in
asia
by
brutish
men
was
increased
tenfold
by
its
conjunction
with
european
intelligence
with
french
wit
the
most
subtle
the
keenest
of
all
intellectual
instruments
henri
could
do
what
he
would
in
the
interest
of
his
pleasures
and
vanities
this
invisible
action
upon
the
social
world
had
invested
him
with
a
real
but
secret
majesty
without
emphasis
and
deriving
from
himself
he
had
not
the
opinion
which
louis
xiv
could
have
of
himself
but
that
which
the
proudest
of
the
caliphs
the
pharoahs
the
xerxes
who
held
themselves
to
be
of
divine
origin
had
of
themselves
when
they
imitated
god
and
veiled
themselves
from
their
subjects
under
the
pretext
that
their
looks
dealt
forth
death
thus
without
any
remorse
at
being
at
once
the
judge
and
the
accuser
de
marsay
coldly
condemned
to
death
the
man
or
the
woman
who
had
seriously
offended
him
although
often
pronounced
almost
lightly
the
verdict
was
irrevocable
an
error
was
a
misfortune
similar
to
that
which
a
thunderbolt
causes
when
it
falls
upon
a
smiling
parisienne
in
some
hackney
coach
instead
of
crushing
the
old
coachman
who
is
driving
her
to
a
thus
the
bitter
and
profound
sarcasm
which
distinguished
the
young
man
s
conversation
usually
tended
to
frighten
people
no
one
was
anxious
to
put
him
out
women
are
prodigiously
fond
of
those
persons
who
call
themselves
pashas
and
who
are
as
it
were
accompanied
by
lions
and
executioners
and
who
walk
in
a
panoply
of
terror
the
result
in
the
case
of
such
men
is
a
security
of
action
a
certitude
of
power
a
pride
of
gaze
a
leonine
consciousness
which
makes
women
realize
the
type
of
strength
of
which
they
all
dream
such
was
de
marsay
happy
for
the
moment
with
his
future
he
grew
young
and
pliable
and
thought
of
nothing
but
love
as
he
went
to
bed
he
dreamed
of
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
as
the
young
and
passionate
can
dream
his
dreams
were
monstrous
images
unattainable
extravagances
full
of
light
revealing
invisible
worlds
yet
in
a
manner
always
incomplete
for
an
intervening
veil
changes
the
conditions
of
vision
for
the
next
and
succeeding
day
henri
disappeared
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
his
power
only
belonged
to
him
under
certain
conditions
and
happily
for
him
during
those
two
days
he
was
a
private
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
demon
to
whom
he
owed
his
talismanic
existence
but
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
he
was
waiting
and
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
carriage
the
mulatto
approached
henri
in
order
to
repeat
to
him
in
french
a
phrase
which
he
seemed
to
have
learned
by
heart
if
you
wish
to
come
she
told
me
you
must
consent
to
have
your
eyes
and
cristemio
produced
a
white
silk
handkerchief
no
said
henri
whose
omnipotence
revolted
suddenly
he
tried
to
leap
in
the
mulatto
made
a
sign
and
the
carriage
drove
off
yes
cried
de
marsay
furious
at
the
thought
of
losing
a
piece
of
good
fortune
which
had
been
promised
him
he
saw
moreover
the
impossibility
of
making
terms
with
a
slave
whose
obedience
was
as
blind
as
the
hangman
s
nor
was
it
this
passive
instrument
upon
whom
his
anger
could
fall
the
mulatto
whistled
the
carriage
returned
henri
got
in
hastily
already
a
few
curious
onlookers
had
assembled
like
sheep
on
the
boulevard
henri
was
strong
he
tried
to
play
the
mulatto
when
the
carriage
started
at
a
gallop
he
seized
his
hands
in
order
to
master
him
and
retain
by
subduing
his
attendant
the
possession
of
his
faculties
so
that
he
might
know
whither
he
was
going
it
was
a
vain
attempt
the
eyes
of
the
mulatto
flashed
from
the
darkness
the
fellow
uttered
a
cry
which
his
fury
stifled
in
his
throat
released
himself
threw
back
de
marsay
with
a
hand
like
iron
and
nailed
him
so
to
speak
to
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
then
with
his
free
hand
he
drew
a
triangular
dagger
and
whistled
the
coachman
heard
the
whistle
and
stopped
henri
was
unarmed
he
was
forced
to
yield
he
moved
his
head
towards
the
handkerchief
the
gesture
of
submission
calmed
cristemio
and
he
bound
his
eyes
with
a
respect
and
care
which
manifested
a
sort
of
veneration
for
the
person
of
the
man
whom
his
idol
loved
but
before
taking
this
course
he
had
placed
his
dagger
distrustfully
in
his
side
pocket
and
buttoned
himself
up
to
the
chin
that
nigger
would
have
killed
me
said
de
marsay
to
himself
once
more
the
carriage
moved
on
rapidly
there
was
one
resource
still
open
to
a
young
man
who
knew
paris
as
well
as
henri
to
know
whither
he
was
going
he
had
but
to
collect
himself
and
count
by
the
number
of
gutters
crossed
the
streets
leading
from
the
boulevards
by
which
the
carriage
passed
so
long
as
it
continued
straight
along
he
could
thus
discover
into
which
lateral
street
it
would
turn
either
towards
the
seine
or
towards
the
heights
of
montmartre
and
guess
the
name
or
position
of
the
street
in
which
his
guide
should
bring
him
to
a
halt
but
the
violent
emotion
which
his
struggle
had
caused
him
the
rage
into
which
his
compromised
dignity
had
thrown
him
the
ideas
of
vengeance
to
which
he
abandoned
himself
the
suppositions
suggested
to
him
by
the
circumstantial
care
which
this
girl
had
taken
in
order
to
bring
him
to
her
all
hindered
him
from
the
attention
which
the
blind
have
necessary
for
the
concentration
of
his
intelligence
and
the
perfect
lucidity
of
his
recollection
the
journey
lasted
half
an
hour
when
the
carriage
stopped
it
was
no
longer
on
the
street
the
mulatto
and
the
coachman
took
henri
in
their
arms
lifted
him
out
and
putting
him
into
a
sort
of
litter
conveyed
him
across
a
garden
he
could
smell
its
flowers
and
the
perfume
peculiar
to
trees
and
grass
the
silence
which
reigned
there
was
so
profound
that
he
could
distinguish
the
noise
made
by
the
drops
of
water
falling
from
the
moist
leaves
the
two
men
took
him
to
a
staircase
set
him
on
his
feet
led
him
by
his
hands
through
several
apartments
and
left
him
in
a
room
whose
atmosphere
was
perfumed
and
the
thick
carpet
of
which
he
could
feel
beneath
his
feet
a
woman
s
hand
pushed
him
on
to
a
divan
and
untied
the
handkerchief
for
him
henri
saw
paquita
before
him
but
paquita
in
all
her
womanly
and
voluptuous
glory
the
section
of
the
boudoir
in
which
henri
found
himself
described
a
circular
line
softly
gracious
which
was
faced
opposite
by
the
other
perfectly
square
half
in
the
midst
of
which
a
shone
of
gold
and
white
marble
he
had
entered
by
a
door
on
one
side
hidden
by
a
rich
tapestried
screen
opposite
which
was
a
window
the
semicircular
portion
was
adorned
with
a
real
turkish
divan
that
is
to
say
a
mattress
thrown
on
the
ground
but
a
mattress
as
broad
as
a
bed
a
divan
fifty
feet
in
circumference
made
of
white
cashmere
relieved
by
bows
of
black
and
scarlet
silk
arranged
in
panels
the
top
of
this
huge
bed
was
raised
several
inches
by
numerous
cushions
which
further
enriched
it
by
their
tasteful
comfort
the
boudoir
was
lined
with
some
red
stuff
over
which
an
indian
muslin
was
stretched
fluted
after
the
fashion
of
corinthian
columns
in
plaits
going
in
and
out
and
bound
at
the
top
and
bottom
by
bands
of
stuff
on
which
were
designs
in
black
arabesque
below
the
muslin
the
poppy
turned
to
rose
that
amorous
color
which
was
matched
by
which
were
of
indian
muslin
lined
with
taffeta
and
set
off
with
a
fringe
of
and
black
six
arms
each
supporting
two
candles
were
attached
to
the
tapestry
at
an
equal
distance
to
illuminate
the
divan
the
ceiling
from
the
middle
of
which
a
lustre
of
unpolished
silver
hung
was
of
a
brilliant
whiteness
and
the
cornice
was
gilded
the
carpet
was
like
an
oriental
shawl
it
had
the
designs
and
recalled
the
poetry
of
persia
where
the
hands
of
slaves
had
worked
on
it
the
furniture
was
covered
in
white
cashmere
relieved
by
black
and
ornaments
the
clock
the
candelabra
all
were
in
white
marble
and
gold
the
only
table
there
had
a
cloth
of
cashmere
elegant
held
roses
of
every
kind
flowers
white
or
red
in
fine
the
least
detail
seemed
to
have
been
the
object
of
loving
thought
never
had
richness
hidden
itself
more
coquettishly
to
become
elegance
to
express
grace
to
inspire
pleasure
everything
there
would
have
warmed
the
coldest
of
beings
the
caresses
of
the
tapestry
of
which
the
color
changed
according
to
the
direction
of
one
s
gaze
becoming
either
all
white
or
all
rose
harmonized
with
the
effects
of
the
light
shed
upon
the
diaphanous
tissues
of
the
muslin
which
produced
an
appearance
of
mistiness
the
soul
has
i
know
not
what
attraction
towards
white
love
delights
in
red
and
the
passions
are
flattered
by
gold
which
has
the
power
of
realizing
their
caprices
thus
all
that
man
possesses
within
him
of
vague
and
mysterious
all
his
inexplicable
affinities
were
caressed
in
their
involuntary
sympathies
there
was
in
this
perfect
harmony
a
concert
of
color
to
which
the
soul
responded
with
vague
and
voluptuous
and
fluctuating
ideas
it
was
out
of
a
misty
atmosphere
laden
with
exquisite
perfumes
that
paquita
clad
in
a
white
wrapper
her
feet
bare
orange
blossoms
in
her
black
hair
appeared
to
henri
knelt
before
him
adoring
him
as
the
god
of
this
temple
whither
he
had
deigned
to
come
although
de
marsay
was
accustomed
to
seeing
the
utmost
efforts
of
parisian
luxury
he
was
surprised
at
the
aspect
of
this
shell
like
that
from
which
venus
rose
out
of
the
sea
whether
from
an
effect
of
contrast
between
the
darkness
from
which
he
issued
and
the
light
which
bathed
his
soul
whether
from
a
comparison
which
he
swiftly
made
between
this
scene
and
that
of
their
first
interview
he
experienced
one
of
those
delicate
sensations
which
true
poetry
gives
perceiving
in
the
midst
of
this
retreat
which
had
been
opened
to
him
as
by
a
fairy
s
magic
wand
the
masterpiece
of
creation
this
girl
whose
warmly
colored
tints
whose
soft
skin
soft
but
slightly
gilded
by
the
shadows
by
i
know
not
what
vaporous
effusion
of
love
gleamed
as
though
it
reflected
the
rays
of
color
and
light
his
anger
his
desire
for
vengeance
his
wounded
vanity
all
were
lost
like
an
eagle
darting
on
his
prey
he
took
her
utterly
to
him
set
her
on
his
knees
and
felt
with
an
indescribable
intoxication
the
voluptuous
pressure
of
this
girl
whose
richly
developed
beauties
softly
enveloped
him
come
to
me
paquita
he
said
in
a
low
voice
speak
speak
without
fear
she
said
this
retreat
was
built
for
love
no
sound
can
escape
from
it
so
greatly
was
it
desired
to
guard
avariciously
the
accents
and
music
of
the
beloved
voice
however
loud
should
be
the
cries
they
would
not
be
heard
without
these
walls
a
person
might
be
murdered
and
his
moans
would
be
as
vain
as
if
he
were
in
the
midst
of
the
great
who
has
understood
jealousy
and
its
needs
so
well
never
question
me
as
to
that
she
answered
untying
with
a
gesture
of
wonderful
sweetness
the
young
man
s
scarf
doubtless
in
order
the
better
to
behold
his
neck
yes
there
is
the
neck
i
love
so
well
she
said
wouldst
thou
please
me
this
interrogation
rendered
by
the
accent
almost
lascivious
drew
de
marsay
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
by
paquita
s
authoritative
refusal
to
allow
him
any
research
as
to
the
unknown
being
who
hovered
like
a
shadow
about
them
and
if
i
wished
to
know
who
reigns
here
paquita
looked
at
him
trembling
it
is
not
i
then
he
said
rising
and
freeing
himself
from
the
girl
whose
head
fell
backwards
where
i
am
i
would
be
strike
strike
said
the
poor
slave
a
prey
to
terror
for
what
do
you
take
me
then
will
you
answer
paquita
got
up
gently
her
eyes
full
of
tears
took
a
poniard
from
one
of
the
two
ebony
pieces
of
furniture
and
presented
it
to
henri
with
a
gesture
of
submission
which
would
have
moved
a
tiger
give
me
a
feast
such
as
men
give
when
they
love
she
said
and
whilst
i
sleep
slay
me
for
i
know
not
how
to
answer
thee
hearken
i
am
bound
like
some
poor
beast
to
a
stake
i
am
amazed
that
i
have
been
able
to
throw
a
bridge
over
the
abyss
which
divides
us
intoxicate
me
then
kill
me
ah
no
no
she
cried
joining
her
hands
do
not
kill
me
i
love
life
life
is
fair
to
me
if
i
am
a
slave
i
am
a
queen
too
i
could
beguile
you
with
words
tell
you
that
i
love
you
alone
prove
it
to
you
profit
by
my
momentary
empire
to
say
to
you
take
me
as
one
tastes
the
perfume
of
a
flower
when
one
passes
it
in
a
king
s
then
after
having
used
the
cunning
eloquence
of
woman
and
soared
on
the
wings
of
pleasure
after
having
quenched
my
thirst
i
could
have
you
cast
into
a
pit
where
none
could
find
you
which
has
been
made
to
gratify
vengeance
without
having
to
fear
that
of
the
law
a
pit
full
of
lime
which
would
kindle
and
consume
you
until
no
particle
of
you
were
left
you
would
stay
in
my
heart
mine
henri
looked
at
the
girl
without
trembling
and
this
fearless
gaze
filled
her
with
joy
no
i
shall
not
do
it
you
have
fallen
into
no
trap
here
but
upon
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
adores
you
and
it
is
i
who
will
be
cast
into
the
all
this
appears
to
me
prodigiously
strange
said
de
marsay
considering
her
but
you
seem
to
me
a
good
girl
a
strange
nature
you
are
upon
my
word
of
honor
a
living
riddle
the
answer
to
which
is
very
difficult
to
paquita
understood
nothing
of
what
the
young
man
said
she
looked
at
him
gently
opening
wide
eyes
which
could
never
be
stupid
so
much
was
pleasure
written
in
them
come
then
my
love
she
said
returning
to
her
first
idea
wouldst
thou
please
me
i
would
do
all
that
thou
wouldst
and
even
that
thou
wouldst
not
answered
de
marsay
with
a
laugh
he
had
recovered
his
foppish
ease
as
he
took
the
resolve
to
let
himself
go
to
the
climax
of
his
good
fortune
looking
neither
before
nor
after
perhaps
he
counted
moreover
on
his
power
and
his
capacity
of
a
man
used
to
adventures
to
dominate
this
girl
a
few
hours
later
and
learn
all
her
secrets
well
said
she
let
me
arrange
you
as
i
would
paquita
went
joyously
and
took
from
one
of
the
two
chests
a
robe
of
red
velvet
in
which
she
dressed
de
marsay
then
adorned
his
head
with
a
woman
s
bonnet
and
wrapped
a
shawl
round
him
abandoning
herself
to
these
follies
with
a
child
s
innocence
she
laughed
a
convulsive
laugh
and
resembled
some
bird
flapping
its
wings
but
he
saw
nothing
beyond
if
it
be
impossible
to
paint
the
delights
which
these
two
creatures
made
by
heaven
in
a
joyous
moment
found
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
translate
metaphysically
the
extraordinary
and
almost
fantastic
impressions
of
the
young
man
that
which
persons
in
the
social
position
of
de
marsay
living
as
he
lived
are
best
able
to
recognize
is
a
girl
s
innocence
but
strange
phenomenon
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
might
be
virgin
but
innocent
she
was
certainly
not
the
fantastic
union
of
the
mysterious
and
the
real
of
darkness
and
light
horror
and
beauty
pleasure
and
danger
paradise
and
hell
which
had
already
been
met
with
in
this
adventure
was
resumed
in
the
capricious
and
sublime
being
with
which
de
marsay
dallied
all
the
utmost
science
or
the
most
refined
pleasure
all
that
henri
could
know
of
that
poetry
of
the
senses
which
is
called
love
was
excelled
by
the
treasures
poured
forth
by
this
girl
whose
radiant
eyes
gave
the
lie
to
none
of
the
promises
which
they
made
she
was
an
oriental
poem
in
which
shone
the
sun
that
saadi
that
hafiz
have
set
in
their
pulsing
strophes
only
neither
the
rhythm
of
saadi
nor
that
of
pindar
could
have
expressed
the
ecstasy
full
of
confusion
and
stupefaction
which
seized
the
delicious
girl
when
the
error
in
which
an
iron
hand
had
caused
her
to
live
was
at
an
end
dead
she
said
i
am
dead
adolphe
take
me
away
to
the
world
s
end
to
an
island
where
no
one
knows
us
let
there
be
no
traces
of
our
flight
we
should
be
followed
to
the
gates
of
hell
god
here
is
the
day
escape
shall
i
ever
see
you
again
yes
i
will
see
you
if
i
have
to
deal
death
to
all
my
warders
to
have
that
joy
till
she
pressed
him
in
her
arms
with
an
embrace
in
which
the
terror
of
death
mingled
then
she
touched
a
spring
which
must
have
been
in
connection
with
a
bell
and
implored
de
marsay
to
permit
his
eyes
to
be
bandaged
and
if
i
would
not
and
if
i
wished
to
stay
here
you
would
be
the
death
of
me
more
speedily
she
said
for
now
i
know
i
am
certain
to
die
on
your
henri
submitted
in
the
man
who
had
just
gorged
himself
with
pleasure
there
occurs
a
propensity
to
forgetfulness
i
know
not
what
ingratitude
a
desire
for
liberty
a
whim
to
go
elsewhere
a
tinge
of
contempt
and
perhaps
of
disgust
for
his
idol
in
fine
indescribable
sentiments
which
render
him
ignoble
and
ashamed
the
certainty
of
this
confused
but
real
feeling
in
souls
who
are
not
illuminated
by
that
celestial
light
nor
perfumed
with
that
holy
essence
from
which
the
performance
of
sentiment
springs
doubtless
suggested
to
rousseau
the
adventures
of
lord
edward
which
conclude
the
letters
of
the
if
rousseau
is
obviously
inspired
by
the
work
of
richardson
he
departs
from
it
in
a
thousand
details
which
leave
his
achievement
magnificently
original
he
has
recommended
it
to
posterity
by
great
ideas
which
it
is
difficult
to
liberate
by
analysis
when
in
one
s
youth
one
reads
this
work
with
the
object
of
finding
in
it
the
lurid
representation
of
the
most
physical
of
our
feelings
whereas
serious
and
philosophical
writers
never
employ
its
images
except
as
the
consequence
or
the
corollary
of
a
vast
thought
and
the
adventures
of
lord
edward
are
one
of
the
most
europeanly
delicate
ideas
of
the
whole
work
henri
therefore
found
himself
beneath
the
domination
of
that
confused
sentiment
which
is
unknown
to
true
love
there
was
needful
in
some
sort
the
persuasive
grip
of
comparisons
and
the
irresistible
attraction
of
memories
to
lead
him
back
to
a
woman
true
love
rules
above
all
through
recollection
a
woman
who
is
not
engraven
upon
the
soul
by
excess
of
pleasure
or
by
strength
of
emotion
how
can
she
ever
be
loved
in
henri
s
case
paquita
had
established
herself
by
both
of
these
reasons
but
at
this
moment
seized
as
he
was
by
the
satiety
of
his
happiness
that
delicious
melancholy
of
the
body
he
could
hardly
analyze
his
heart
even
by
recalling
to
his
lips
the
taste
of
the
liveliest
gratifications
that
he
had
ever
grasped
he
found
himself
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
at
the
break
of
day
gazed
stupidly
at
the
retreating
carriage
produced
two
cigars
from
his
pocket
lit
one
from
the
lantern
of
a
good
woman
who
sold
brandy
and
coffee
to
workmen
and
street
arabs
and
chestnut
venders
to
all
the
parisian
populace
which
begins
its
work
before
daybreak
then
he
went
off
smoking
his
cigar
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
with
a
air
which
did
him
small
honor
what
a
good
thing
a
cigar
is
that
s
one
thing
a
man
will
never
tire
of
he
said
to
himself
of
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
over
whom
at
that
time
all
the
elegant
youth
of
paris
was
mad
he
hardly
thought
the
idea
of
death
expressed
in
the
midst
of
their
pleasure
and
the
fear
of
which
had
more
than
once
darkened
the
brow
of
that
beautiful
creature
who
held
to
the
houris
of
asia
by
her
mother
to
europe
by
her
education
to
the
tropics
by
her
birth
seemed
to
him
merely
one
of
those
deceptions
by
which
women
seek
to
make
themselves
interesting
she
is
from
havana
the
most
spanish
region
to
be
found
in
the
new
world
so
she
preferred
to
feign
terror
rather
than
cast
in
my
teeth
indisposition
or
difficulty
coquetry
or
duty
like
a
parisian
woman
by
her
golden
eyes
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
he
saw
a
hackney
coach
standing
at
the
corner
of
frascati
s
waiting
for
some
gambler
he
awoke
the
driver
was
driven
home
went
to
bed
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dissipated
which
for
some
queer
reason
of
which
no
rhymer
has
yet
taken
advantage
is
as
profound
as
that
of
innocence
perhaps
it
is
an
instance
of
the
proverbial
axiom
about
noon
de
marsay
awoke
and
stretched
himself
he
felt
the
grip
of
that
sort
of
voracious
hunger
which
old
soldiers
can
remember
having
experienced
on
the
morrow
of
victory
he
was
delighted
therefore
to
see
paul
de
manerville
standing
in
front
of
him
for
at
such
a
time
nothing
is
more
agreeable
than
to
eat
in
company
well
his
friend
remarked
we
all
imagined
that
you
had
been
shut
up
for
the
last
ten
days
with
the
girl
of
the
golden
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
i
have
forgotten
her
faith
i
have
other
fish
to
fry
ah
you
are
playing
at
why
not
asked
de
marsay
with
a
laugh
my
dear
fellow
discretion
is
the
best
form
of
calculation
listen
however
no
i
will
not
say
a
word
you
never
teach
me
anything
i
am
not
disposed
to
make
you
a
gratuitous
present
of
the
treasures
of
my
policy
life
is
a
river
which
is
of
use
for
the
promotion
of
commerce
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
most
sacred
in
life
of
cigars
i
am
no
professor
of
social
economy
for
the
instruction
of
fools
let
us
breakfast
it
costs
less
to
give
you
a
tunny
omelette
than
to
lavish
the
resources
of
my
brain
on
do
you
bargain
with
your
friends
my
dear
fellow
said
henri
who
rarely
denied
himself
a
sarcasm
since
all
the
same
you
may
some
day
need
like
anybody
else
to
use
discretion
and
since
i
have
much
love
for
you
yes
i
like
you
upon
my
word
if
you
only
wanted
a
note
to
keep
you
from
blowing
your
brains
out
you
would
find
it
here
for
we
haven
t
yet
done
any
business
of
that
sort
eh
paul
if
you
had
to
fight
i
would
measure
the
ground
and
load
the
pistols
so
that
you
might
be
killed
according
to
rule
in
short
if
anybody
besides
myself
took
it
into
his
head
to
say
ill
of
you
in
your
absence
he
would
have
to
deal
with
the
somewhat
nasty
gentleman
who
walks
in
my
shoes
there
s
what
i
call
a
friendship
beyond
question
well
my
good
fellow
if
you
should
ever
have
need
of
discretion
understand
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
discretion
the
active
and
the
negative
negative
discretion
is
that
of
fools
who
make
use
of
silence
negation
an
air
of
refusal
the
discretion
of
locked
doors
mere
impotence
active
discretion
proceeds
by
affirmation
suppose
at
the
club
this
evening
i
were
to
say
upon
my
word
of
honor
the
was
not
worth
all
she
cost
me
everybody
would
exclaim
when
i
was
gone
did
you
hear
that
fop
de
marsay
who
tried
to
make
us
believe
that
he
has
already
had
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
it
s
his
way
of
trying
to
disembarrass
himself
of
his
rivals
he
s
no
but
such
a
ruse
is
vulgar
and
dangerous
however
gross
a
folly
one
utters
there
are
always
idiots
to
be
found
who
will
believe
it
the
best
form
of
discretion
is
that
of
women
when
they
want
to
take
the
change
out
of
their
husbands
it
consists
in
compromising
a
woman
with
whom
we
are
not
concerned
or
whom
we
do
not
love
in
order
to
save
the
honor
of
the
one
whom
we
love
well
enough
to
respect
it
is
what
is
called
the
ah
here
is
laurent
what
have
you
got
for
us
some
ostend
oysters
monsieur
le
you
will
know
some
day
paul
how
amusing
it
is
to
make
a
fool
of
the
world
by
depriving
it
of
the
secret
of
one
s
affections
i
derive
an
immense
pleasure
in
escaping
from
the
stupid
jurisdiction
of
the
crowd
which
knows
neither
what
it
wants
nor
what
one
wants
of
it
which
takes
the
means
for
the
end
and
by
turns
curses
and
adores
elevates
and
destroys
what
a
delight
to
impose
emotions
on
it
and
receive
none
from
it
to
tame
it
never
to
obey
it
if
one
may
ever
be
proud
of
anything
is
it
not
a
power
of
which
one
is
at
once
the
cause
and
effect
the
principle
and
the
result
well
no
man
knows
what
i
love
nor
what
i
wish
perhaps
what
i
have
loved
or
what
i
may
have
wished
will
be
known
as
a
drama
which
is
accomplished
is
known
but
to
let
my
game
be
seen
weakness
mistake
i
know
nothing
more
despicable
than
strength
outwitted
by
cunning
can
i
initiate
myself
with
a
laugh
into
the
ambassador
s
part
if
indeed
diplomacy
is
as
difficult
as
life
i
doubt
it
have
you
any
ambition
would
you
like
to
become
something
but
henri
you
are
laughing
at
me
as
though
i
were
not
sufficiently
mediocre
to
arrive
at
good
paul
if
you
go
on
laughing
at
yourself
you
will
soon
be
able
to
laugh
at
everybody
at
breakfast
by
the
time
he
had
started
his
cigars
de
marsay
began
to
see
the
events
of
the
night
in
a
singular
light
like
many
men
of
great
intelligence
his
perspicuity
was
not
spontaneous
as
it
did
not
at
once
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
things
as
with
all
natures
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
living
greatly
in
the
present
of
extracting
so
to
speak
the
essence
of
it
and
assimilating
it
his
had
need
of
a
sort
of
slumber
before
it
could
identify
itself
with
causes
cardinal
de
richelieu
was
so
constituted
and
it
did
not
debar
in
him
the
gift
of
foresight
necessary
to
the
conception
of
great
designs
de
marsay
s
conditions
were
alike
but
at
first
he
only
used
his
weapons
for
the
benefit
of
his
pleasures
and
only
became
one
of
the
most
profound
politicians
of
his
day
when
he
had
saturated
himself
with
those
pleasures
to
which
a
young
man
s
thoughts
when
he
has
money
and
power
are
primarily
directed
man
hardens
himself
thus
he
uses
woman
in
order
that
she
may
not
make
use
of
him
at
this
moment
then
de
marsay
perceived
that
he
had
been
fooled
by
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
seeing
as
he
did
in
perspective
all
that
night
of
which
the
delights
had
been
poured
upon
him
by
degrees
until
they
had
ended
by
flooding
him
in
torrents
he
could
read
at
last
that
page
in
effect
so
brilliant
divine
its
hidden
meaning
the
purely
physical
innocence
of
paquita
the
bewilderment
of
her
joy
certain
words
obscure
at
first
but
now
clear
which
had
escaped
her
in
the
midst
of
that
joy
all
proved
to
him
that
he
had
posed
for
another
person
as
no
social
corruption
was
unknown
to
him
as
he
professed
a
complete
indifference
towards
all
perversities
and
believed
them
to
be
justified
on
the
simple
ground
that
they
were
capable
of
satisfaction
he
was
not
startled
at
vice
he
knew
it
as
one
knows
a
friend
but
he
was
wounded
at
having
served
as
sustenance
for
it
if
his
presumption
was
right
he
had
been
outraged
in
the
most
sensitive
part
of
him
the
mere
suspicion
filled
him
with
fury
he
broke
out
with
the
roar
of
a
tiger
who
has
been
the
sport
of
a
deer
the
cry
of
a
tiger
which
united
a
brute
s
strength
with
the
intelligence
of
the
demon
i
say
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
paul
nothing
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
were
to
be
asked
whether
you
had
anything
against
me
and
were
to
reply
with
a
like
that
it
would
be
a
sure
case
of
fighting
the
next
i
fight
no
more
duels
said
de
marsay
that
seems
to
me
even
more
tragical
do
you
assassinate
then
you
travesty
words
i
my
dear
friend
said
paul
your
jokes
are
of
a
very
sombre
color
this
what
would
you
have
pleasure
ends
in
cruelty
why
i
don
t
know
and
am
not
sufficiently
curious
to
try
and
find
out
these
cigars
are
excellent
give
your
friend
some
tea
do
you
know
paul
i
live
a
brute
s
life
it
should
be
time
to
choose
oneself
a
destiny
to
employ
one
s
powers
on
something
which
makes
life
worth
living
life
is
a
singular
comedy
i
am
frightened
i
laugh
at
the
inconsequence
of
our
social
order
the
government
cuts
off
the
heads
of
poor
devils
who
may
have
killed
a
man
and
licenses
creatures
who
despatch
medically
speaking
a
dozen
young
folks
in
a
season
morality
is
powerless
against
a
dozen
vices
which
destroy
society
and
which
nothing
can

they
talk
to
us
about
the
immorality
of
the
and
any
other
book
you
like
with
a
vulgar
reputation
but
there
exists
a
book
horrible
filthy
fearful
corrupting
which
is
always
open
and
will
never
be
shut
the
great
book
of
the
world
not
to
mention
another
book
a
thousand
times
more
dangerous
which
is
composed
of
all
that
men
whisper
into
each
other
s
ears
or
women
murmur
behind
their
fans
of
an
evening
in
henri
there
is
certainly
something
extraordinary
the
matter
with
you
that
is
obvious
in
spite
of
your
active
yes
come
i
must
kill

time
until
this
evening

tables

rose
took
a
handful
of
banknotes
and
folded
them
into
his
dressed
himself
and
took
advantage
of
paul
s
carriage
to
repair
to
the
salon
des
etrangers
where
until
dinner
he
consumed
the
time
in
those
exciting
alternations
of
loss
and
gain
which
are
the
last
resource
of
powerful
organizations
when
they
are
compelled
to
exercise
themselves
in
the
void
in
the
evening
he
repaired
to
the
and
submitted
complacently
to
having
his
eyes
bandaged
then
with
that
firm
will
which
only
really
strong
men
have
the
faculty
of
concentrating
he
devoted
his
attention
and
applied
his
intelligence
to
the
task
of
divining
through
what
streets
the
carriage
passed
he
had
a
sort
of
certitude
of
being
taken
to
the
rue
and
being
brought
to
a
halt
at
the
little
gate
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
when
he
passed
as
on
the
first
occasion
through
this
gate
and
was
put
in
a
litter
carried
doubtless
by
the
mulatto
and
the
coachman
he
understood
as
he
heard
the
gravel
grate
beneath
their
feet
why
they
took
such
minute
precautions
he
would
have
been
able
had
he
been
free
or
if
he
had
walked
to
pluck
a
twig
of
laurel
to
observe
the
nature
of
the
soil
which
clung
to
his
boots
whereas
transported
so
to
speak
ethereally
into
an
inaccessible
mansion
his
good
fortune
must
remain
what
it
had
been
hitherto
a
dream
but
it
is
man
s
despair
that
all
his
work
whether
for
good
or
evil
is
imperfect
all
his
labors
physical
or
intellectual
are
sealed
with
the
mark
of
destruction
there
had
been
a
gentle
rain
the
earth
was
moist
at
certain
vegetable
perfumes
are
far
stronger
than
during
the
day
henri
could
smell
therefore
the
scent
of
the
mignonette
which
lined
the
avenue
along
which
he
was
conveyed
this
indication
was
enough
to
light
him
in
the
researches
which
he
promised
himself
to
make
in
order
to
recognize
the
hotel
which
contained
paquita
s
boudoir
he
studied
in
the
same
way
the
turnings
which
his
bearers
took
within
the
house
and
believed
himself
able
to
recall
them
as
on
the
previous
night
he
found
himself
on
the
ottoman
before
paquita
who
was
undoing
his
bandage
but
he
saw
her
pale
and
altered
she
had
wept
on
her
knees
like
an
angel
in
prayer
but
like
an
angel
profoundly
sad
and
melancholy
the
poor
girl
no
longer
resembled
the
curious
impatient
and
impetuous
creature
who
had
carried
de
marsay
on
her
wings
to
transport
him
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
love
there
was
something
so
true
in
this
despair
veiled
by
pleasure
that
the
terrible
de
marsay
felt
within
him
an
admiration
for
this
new
masterpiece
of
nature
and
forgot
for
the
moment
the
chief
interest
of
his
assignation
what
is
the
matter
with
thee
my
paquita
my
friend
she
said
carry
me
away
this
very
night
bear
me
to
some
place
where
no
one
can
answer
there
is
a
girl
with
a
golden
gaze
here
who
has
long
yonder
i
will
give
thee
as
many
pleasures
as
thou
wouldst
have
of
me
then
when
you
love
me
no
longer
you
shall
leave
me
i
shall
not
complain
i
shall
say
nothing
and
your
desertion
need
cause
you
no
remorse
for
one
day
passed
with
you
only
one
day
in
which
i
have
had
you
before
my
eyes
will
be
worth
all
my
life
to
me
but
if
i
stay
here
i
am
i
can
not
leave
paris
little
one
replied
henri
i
do
not
belong
to
myself
i
am
bound
by
a
vow
to
the
fortune
of
several
persons
who
stand
to
me
as
i
do
to
them
but
i
can
place
you
in
a
refuge
in
paris
where
no
human
power
can
reach
no
she
said
you
forget
the
power
of
never
did
phrase
uttered
by
human
voice
express
terror
more
absolutely
what
could
reach
you
then
if
i
put
myself
between
you
and
the
world
poison
she
said
dona
concha
suspects
you
already
and
she
resumed
letting
the
tears
fall
and
glisten
on
her
cheeks
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
i
am
no
longer
the
same
well
if
you
abandon
me
to
the
fury
of
the
monster
who
will
destroy
me
your
holy
will
be
done
but
come
let
there
be
all
the
pleasures
of
life
in
our
love
besides
i
will
implore
i
will
weep
and
cry
out
and
defend
myself
perhaps
i
shall
be
whom
will
your
implore
he
asked
silence
said
paquita
if
i
obtain
mercy
it
will
perhaps
be
on
account
of
my
give
me
my
robe
said
henri
insidiously
no
no
she
answered
quickly
be
what
you
are
one
of
those
angels
whom
i
have
been
taught
to
hate
and
in
whom
i
only
saw
ogres
whilst
you
are
what
is
fairest
under
the
skies
she
said
caressing
henri
s
hair
you
do
not
know
how
silly
i
am
i
have
learned
nothing
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
have
been
shut
up
without
ever
seeing
any
one
i
can
neither
read
nor
write
i
can
only
speak
english
and
how
is
it
then
that
you
receive
letters
from
london
my
letters
see
here
they
are
she
said
proceeding
to
take
some
papers
out
of
a
tall
japanese
vase
she
offered
de
marsay
some
letters
in
which
the
young
man
saw
with
surprise
strange
figures
similar
to
those
of
a
rebus
traced
in
blood
and
illustrating
phrases
full
of
passion
but
he
cried
marveling
at
these
hieroglyphics
created
by
the
alertness
of
jealousy
you
are
in
the
power
of
an
infernal
genius
infernal
she
repeated
but
how
then
were
you
able
to
get
out
ah
she
said
that
was
my
ruin
i
drove
dona
concha
to
choose
between
the
fear
of
immediate
death
and
anger
to
be
i
had
the
curiosity
of
a
demon
i
wished
to
break
the
bronze
circle
which
they
had
described
between
creation
and
me
i
wished
to
see
what
young
people
were
like
for
i
knew
nothing
of
man
except
the
marquis
and
cristemio
our
coachman
and
the
lackey
who
accompanies
us
are
old
men
but
you
were
not
always
thus
shut
up
your
health
ah
she
answered
we
used
to
walk
but
it
was
at
night
and
in
the
country
by
the
side
of
the
seine
away
from
are
you
not
proud
of
being
loved
like
that
no
she
said
no
longer
however
full
it
be
this
hidden
life
is
but
darkness
in
comparison
with
the
what
do
you
call
the
light
thee
my
lovely
adolphe
thee
for
whom
i
would
give
my
life
all
the
passionate
things
that
have
been
told
me
and
that
i
have
inspired
i
feel
for
thee
for
a
certain
time
i
understood
nothing
of
existence
but
now
i
know
what
love
is
and
hitherto
i
have
been
the
loved
one
only
for
myself
i
did
not
love
i
would
give
up
everything
for
you
take
me
away
if
you
like
take
me
as
a
toy
but
let
me
be
near
you
until
you
break
you
will
have
no
regrets
not
one
she
said
letting
him
read
her
eyes
whose
golden
tint
was
pure
and
clear
am
i
the
favored
one
said
henri
to
himself
if
he
suspected
the
truth
he
was
ready
at
that
time
to
pardon
the
offence
in
view
of
a
love
so
single
minded
i
shall
soon
see
he
thought
if
paquita
owed
him
no
account
of
the
past
yet
the
least
recollection
of
it
became
in
his
eyes
a
crime
he
had
therefore
the
sombre
strength
to
withhold
a
portion
of
his
thought
to
study
her
even
while
abandoning
himself
to
the
most
enticing
pleasures
that
ever
peri
descended
from
the
skies
had
devised
for
her
beloved
paquita
seemed
to
have
been
created
for
love
by
a
particular
effort
of
nature
in
a
night
her
feminine
genius
had
made
the
most
rapid
progress
whatever
might
be
the
power
of
this
young
man
and
his
indifference
in
the
matter
of
pleasures
in
spite
of
his
satiety
of
the
previous
night
he
found
in
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
that
seraglio
which
a
loving
woman
knows
how
to
create
and
which
a
man
never
refuses
paquita
responded
to
that
passion
which
is
felt
by
all
really
great
men
for
the
infinite
that
mysterious
passion
so
dramatically
expressed
in
faust
so
poetically
translated
in
manfred
and
which
urged
don
juan
to
search
the
heart
of
women
in
his
hope
to
find
there
that
limitless
thought
in
pursuit
of
which
so
many
hunters
after
spectres
have
started
which
wise
men
think
to
discover
in
science
and
which
mystics
find
in
god
alone
the
hope
of
possessing
at
last
the
ideal
being
with
whom
the
struggle
could
be
constant
and
tireless
ravished
de
marsay
who
for
the
first
time
for
long
opened
his
heart
his
nerves
expanded
his
coldness
was
dissipated
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
ardent
soul
his
hard
and
fast
theories
melted
away
and
happiness
colored
his
existence
to
the
tint
of
the
rose
and
white
boudoir
experiencing
the
sting
of
a
higher
pleasure
he
was
carried
beyond
the
limits
within
which
he
had
hitherto
confined
passion
he
would
not
be
surpassed
by
this
girl
whom
a
somewhat
artificial
love
had
formed
all
ready
for
the
needs
of
his
soul
and
then
he
found
in
that
vanity
which
urges
a
man
to
be
in
all
things
a
victor
strength
enough
to
tame
the
girl
but
at
the
same
time
urged
beyond
that
line
where
the
soul
is
mistress
over
herself
he
lost
himself
in
these
delicious
limboes
which
the
vulgar
call
so
foolishly
the
imaginary
he
was
tender
kind
and
confidential
he
affected
paquita
almost
to
madness
why
should
we
not
go
to
sorrento
to
nice
to
chiavari
and
pass
all
our
life
so
will
you
he
asked
of
paquita
in
a
penetrating
voice
was
there
need
to
say
to
me
will
you
she
cried
have
i
a
will
i
am
nothing
apart
from
you
except
in
so
far
as
i
am
a
pleasure
for
you
if
you
would
choose
a
retreat
worthy
of
us
asia
is
the
only
country
where
love
can
unfold
his
wings
you
are
right
answered
henri
let
us
go
to
the
indies
there
where
spring
is
eternal
where
the
earth
grows
only
flowers
where
man
can
display
the
magnificence
of
kings
and
none
shall
say
him
nay
as
in
the
foolish
lands
where
they
would
realize
the
dull
chimera
of
equality
let
us
go
to
the
country
where
one
lives
in
the
midst
of
a
nation
of
slaves
where
the
sun
shines
ever
on
a
palace
which
is
always
white
where
the
air
sheds
perfumes
the
birds
sing
of
love
and
where
when
one
can
love
no
more
one
dies
and
where
one
dies
together
said
paquita
but
do
not
let
us
start
let
us
start
this
moment
take
faith
pleasure
is
the
fairest
climax
of
life
let
us
go
to
asia
but
to
start
my
child
one
needs
much
gold
and
to
have
gold
one
must
set
one
s
affairs
in
she
understood
no
part
of
these
ideas
gold
there
is
a
pile
of
it
here
as
high
as
that
she
said
holding
up
her
hand
it
is
not
what
does
that
matter
she
went
on
if
we
have
need
of
it
let
us
take
it
does
not
belong
to
belong
she
repeated
have
you
not
taken
me
when
we
have
taken
it
it
will
belong
to
he
gave
a
laugh
poor
innocent
you
know
nothing
of
the
nay
but
this
is
what
i
know
she
cried
clasping
henri
to
her
at
the
very
moment
when
de
marsay
was
forgetting
all
and
conceiving
the
desire
to
appropriate
this
creature
forever
he
received
in
the
midst
of
his
joy
a
which
paquita
who
had
lifted
him
vigorously
in
the
air
as
though
to
contemplate
him
exclaimed
oh
margarita
margarita
cried
the
young
man
with
a
roar
now
i
know
all
that
i
still
tried
to
he
leaped
upon
the
cabinet
in
which
the
long
poniard
was
kept
happily
for
paquita
and
for
himself
the
cupboard
was
shut
his
fury
waxed
at
this
impediment
but
he
recovered
his
tranquillity
went
and
found
his
cravat
and
advanced
towards
her
with
an
air
of
such
ferocious
meaning
that
without
knowing
of
what
crime
she
had
been
guilty
paquita
understood
none
the
less
that
her
life
was
in
question
with
one
bound
she
rushed
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
escape
the
fatal
knot
which
de
marsay
tried
to
pass
round
her
neck
there
was
a
struggle
on
either
side
there
was
an
equality
of
strength
agility
and
suppleness
to
end
the
combat
paquita
threw
between
the
legs
of
her
lover
a
cushion
which
made
him
fall
and
profited
by
the
respite
which
this
advantage
gave
to
her
to
push
the
button
of
the
spring
which
caused
the
bell
to
ring
promptly
the
mulatto
arrived
in
a
second
cristemio
leaped
on
de
marsay
and
held
him
down
with
one
foot
on
his
chest
his
heel
turned
towards
the
throat
de
marsay
realized
that
if
he
struggled
at
a
single
sign
from
paquita
he
would
be
instantly
crushed
why
did
you
want
to
kill
me
my
beloved
she
said
de
marsay
made
no
reply
in
what
have
i
angered
you
she
asked
speak
let
us
understand
each
henri
maintained
the
phlegmatic
attitude
of
a
strong
man
who
feels
himself
vanquished
his
countenance
cold
silent
entirely
english
revealed
the
consciousness
of
his
dignity
in
a
momentary
resignation
moreover
he
had
already
thought
in
spite
of
the
vehemence
of
his
anger
that
it
was
scarcely
prudent
to
compromise
himself
with
the
law
by
killing
this
girl
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
before
he
had
arranged
the
murder
in
such
a
manner
as
should
insure
his
impunity
my
beloved
went
on
paquita
speak
to
me
do
not
leave
me
without
one
loving
farewell
i
would
not
keep
in
my
heart
the
terror
which
you
have
just
inspired
in
it
will
you
speak
she
said
stamping
her
foot
with
anger
de
marsay
for
all
reply
gave
her
a
glance
which
signified
so
plainly
must
die
that
paquita
threw
herself
upon
him
ah
well
you
want
to
kill
me
if
my
death
can
give
you
any
pleasure
kill
me
she
made
a
sign
to
cristemio
who
withdrew
his
foot
from
the
body
of
the
young
man
and
retired
without
letting
his
face
show
that
he
had
formed
any
opinion
good
or
bad
with
regard
to
paquita
that
is
a
man
said
de
marsay
pointing
to
the
mulatto
with
a
sombre
gesture
there
is
no
devotion
like
the
devotion
which
obeys
in
friendship
and
does
not
stop
to
weigh
motives
in
that
man
you
possess
a
true
i
will
give
him
you
if
you
like
she
answered
he
will
serve
you
with
the
same
devotion
that
he
has
for
me
if
i
so
instruct
she
waited
for
a
word
of
recognition
and
went
on
with
an
accent
replete
with
tenderness
adolphe
give
me
then
one
kind
word
it
is
nearly
henri
did
not
answer
the
young
man
had
one
sorry
quality
for
one
considers
as
something
great
everything
which
resembles
strength
and
often
men
invent
extravagances
henri
knew
not
how
to
pardon
that
upon
which
is
one
of
the
soul
s
graces
was
a
sense
for
him
the
ferocity
of
the
northern
man
with
which
the
english
blood
is
deeply
tainted
had
been
transmitted
to
him
by
his
father
he
was
inexorable
both
in
his
good
and
evil
impulses
paquita
s
exclamation
had
been
all
the
more
horrible
to
him
in
that
it
had
dethroned
him
from
the
sweetest
triumph
which
had
ever
flattered
his
man
s
vanity
hope
love
and
every
emotion
had
been
exalted
with
him
all
had
lit
up
within
his
heart
and
his
intelligence
then
these
torches
illuminating
his
life
had
been
extinguished
by
a
cold
wind
paquita
in
her
stupefaction
of
grief
had
only
strength
enough
to
give
the
signal
for
departure
what
is
the
use
of
that
she
said
throwing
away
the
bandage
if
he
does
not
love
me
if
he
hates
me
it
is
all
she
waited
for
one
look
did
not
obtain
it
and
fell
half
dead
the
mulatto
cast
a
glance
at
henri
so
horribly
significant
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
young
man
to
whom
no
one
denied
the
gift
of
rare
courage
trembled
you
do
not
love
her
well
if
you
give
her
the
least
pain
i
will
kill
such
was
the
sense
of
that
brief
gaze
de
marsay
was
escorted
with
a
care
almost
obsequious
along
the
dimly
lit
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
he
issued
by
a
secret
door
into
the
garden
of
the
hotel
the
mulatto
made
him
walk
cautiously
through
an
avenue
of
lime
trees
which
led
to
a
little
gate
opening
upon
a
street
which
was
at
that
hour
deserted
de
marsay
took
a
keen
notice
of
everything
the
carriage
awaited
him
this
time
the
mulatto
did
not
accompany
him
and
at
the
moment
when
henri
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
look
once
more
at
the
gardens
of
the
hotel
he
encountered
the
white
eyes
of
cristemio
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
glance
on
either
side
there
was
a
provocation
a
challenge
the
declaration
of
a
savage
war
of
a
duel
in
which
ordinary
laws
were
invalid
where
treason
and
treachery
were
admitted
means
cristemio
knew
that
henri
had
sworn
paquita
s
death
henri
knew
that
cristemio
would
like
to
kill
him
before
he
killed
paquita
both
understood
each
other
to
perfection
the
adventure
is
growing
complicated
in
a
most
interesting
way
said
henri
where
is
the
gentleman
going
to
asked
the
coachman
de
marsay
was
driven
to
the
house
of
paul
de
manerville
for
more
than
a
week
henri
was
away
from
home
and
no
one
could
discover
either
what
he
did
during
this
period
nor
where
he
stayed
this
retreat
saved
him
from
the
fury
of
the
mulatto
and
caused
the
ruin
of
the
charming
creature
who
had
placed
all
her
hope
in
him
whom
she
loved
as
never
human
heart
had
loved
on
this
earth
before
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
about
eleven
o
clock
at
night
henri
drove
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
little
gate
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
four
men
accompanied
him
the
driver
was
evidently
one
of
his
friends
for
he
stood
up
on
his
box
like
a
man
who
was
to
listen
an
attentive
sentinel
for
the
least
sound
one
of
the
other
three
took
his
stand
outside
the
gate
in
the
street
the
second
waited
in
the
garden
leaning
against
the
wall
the
last
who
carried
in
his
hand
a
bunch
of
keys
accompanied
de
marsay
henri
said
his
companion
to
him
we
are
by
whom
my
good
ferragus
they
are
not
all
asleep
replied
the
chief
of
the
devourers
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
some
one
in
the
house
has
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
look
see
that
light
we
have
a
plan
of
the
house
from
where
does
it
come
i
need
no
plan
to
know
replied
ferragus
it
comes
from
the
room
of
the
ah
cried
de
marsay
no
doubt
she
arrived
from
london
the
woman
has
robbed
me
even
of
my
revenge
but
if
she
has
anticipated
me
my
good
gratien
we
will
give
her
up
to
the
listen
listen
the
thing
is
settled
said
ferragus
to
henri
the
two
friends
listened
intently
and
heard
some
feeble
cries
which
might
have
aroused
pity
in
the
breast
of
a
tiger
your
marquise
did
not
think
the
sound
would
escape
by
the
chimney
said
the
chief
of
the
devourers
with
the
laugh
of
a
critic
enchanted
to
detect
a
fault
in
a
work
of
merit
we
alone
we
know
how
to
provide
for
every
contingency
said
henri
wait
for
me
i
want
to
see
what
is
going
on
upstairs
i
want
to
know
how
their
domestic
quarrels
are
managed
by
god
i
believe
she
is
roasting
her
at
a
slow
de
marsay
lightly
scaled
the
stairs
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
recognized
the
passage
leading
to
the
boudoir
when
he
opened
the
door
he
experienced
the
involuntary
shudder
which
the
sight
of
bloodshed
gives
to
the
most
determined
of
men
the
spectacle
which
was
offered
to
his
view
was
moreover
in
more
than
one
respect
astonishing
to
him
the
marquise
was
a
woman
she
had
calculated
her
vengeance
with
that
perfection
of
perfidy
which
distinguishes
the
weaker
animals
she
had
dissimulated
her
anger
in
order
to
assure
herself
of
the
crime
before
she
punished
it
too
late
my
beloved
said
paquita
in
her
death
agony
casting
her
pale
eyes
upon
de
marsay
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
expired
in
a
bath
of
blood
the
great
illumination
of
candles
a
delicate
perfume
which
was
perceptible
a
certain
disorder
in
which
the
eye
of
a
man
accustomed
to
amorous
adventures
could
not
but
discern
the
madness
which
is
common
to
all
the
passions
revealed
how
cunningly
the
marquise
had
interrogated
the
guilty
one
the
white
room
where
the
blood
showed
so
well
betrayed
a
long
struggle
the
prints
of
paquita
s
hands
were
on
the
cushions
here
she
had
clung
to
her
life
here
she
had
defended
herself
here
she
had
been
struck
long
strips
of
the
tapestry
had
been
torn
down
by
her
bleeding
hands
which
without
a
doubt
had
struggled
long
paquita
must
have
tried
to
reach
the
window
her
bare
feet
had
left
their
imprints
on
the
edge
of
the
divan
along
which
she
must
have
run
her
body
mutilated
by
the
of
her
executioner
told
of
the
fury
with
which
she
had
disputed
a
life
which
henri
had
made
precious
to
her
she
lay
stretched
on
the
floor
and
in
her
had
bitten
the
ankles
of
madame
de
who
still
held
in
her
hand
her
dagger
dripping
blood
the
hair
of
the
marquise
had
been
torn
out
she
was
covered
with
bites
many
of
which
were
bleeding
and
her
torn
dress
revealed
her
in
a
state
of
with
the
scratches
on
her
breasts
she
was
sublime
so
her
head
eager
and
maddened
exhaled
the
odor
of
blood
her
panting
mouth
was
open
and
her
nostrils
were
not
sufficient
for
her
breath
there
are
certain
animals
who
fall
upon
their
enemy
in
their
rage
do
it
to
death
and
seem
in
the
tranquillity
of
victory
to
have
forgotten
it
there
are
others
who
prowl
around
their
victim
who
guard
it
in
fear
lest
it
should
be
taken
away
from
them
and
who
like
the
achilles
of
homer
drag
their
enemy
by
the
feet
nine
times
round
the
walls
of
troy
the
marquise
was
like
that
she
did
not
see
henri
in
the
first
place
she
was
too
secure
of
her
solitude
to
be
afraid
of
witnesses
and
secondly
she
was
too
intoxicated
with
warm
blood
too
excited
with
the
fray
too
exalted
to
take
notice
of
the
whole
of
paris
if
paris
had
formed
a
circle
round
her
a
thunderbolt
would
not
have
disturbed
her
she
had
not
even
heard
paquita
s
last
sigh
and
believed
that
the
dead
girl
could
still
hear
her
die
without
confessing
she
said
go
down
to
hell
monster
of
ingratitude
belong
to
no
one
but
the
fiend
for
the
blood
you
gave
him
you
owe
me
all
your
own
die
die
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
i
have
been
too
kind
i
was
only
a
moment
killing
you
i
should
have
made
you
experience
all
the
tortures
that
you
have
bequeathed
to
me
i
i
shall
live
i
shall
live
in
misery
i
have
no
one
left
to
love
but
god
she
gazed
at
her
she
is
dead
she
said
to
herself
after
a
pause
in
a
violent
reaction
dead
oh
i
shall
die
of
grief
the
marquise
was
throwing
herself
upon
the
divan
stricken
with
a
despair
which
deprived
her
of
speech
when
this
movement
brought
her
in
view
of
henri
de
marsay
who
are
you
she
asked
rushing
at
him
with
her
dagger
raised
henri
caught
her
arm
and
thus
they
could
contemplate
each
other
face
to
face
a
horrible
surprise
froze
the
blood
in
their
veins
and
their
limbs
quivered
like
those
of
frightened
horses
in
effect
the
two
menoechmi
had
not
been
more
alike
with
one
accord
they
uttered
the
same
phrase
lord
dudley
must
have
been
your
father
the
head
of
each
was
drooped
in
affirmation
she
was
true
to
the
blood
said
henri
pointing
to
paquita
she
was
as
little
guilty
as
it
is
possible
to
be
replied
margarita
euphemia
porraberil
and
she
threw
herself
upon
the
body
of
paquita
giving
vent
to
a
cry
of
despair
poor
child
oh
if
i
could
bring
thee
to
life
again
i
was
wrong
forgive
me
paquita
dead
and
i
live
i
i
am
the
most
at
that
moment
the
horrible
face
of
the
mother
of
paquita
appeared
you
are
come
to
tell
me
that
you
never
sold
her
to
me
to
kill
cried
the
marquise
i
know
why
you
have
left
your
lair
i
will
pay
you
twice
over
hold
your
she
took
a
bag
of
gold
from
the
ebony
cabinet
and
threw
it
contemptuously
at
the
old
woman
s
feet
the
chink
of
the
gold
was
potent
enough
to
excite
a
smile
on
the
georgian
s
impassive
face
i
come
at
the
right
moment
for
you
my
sister
said
henri
the
law
will
ask
of
you
nothing
replied
the
marquise
one
person
alone
might
ask
for
a
reckoning
for
the
death
of
this
girl
cristemio
is
and
the
mother
said
henri
pointing
to
the
old
woman
will
you
not
always
be
in
her
power
she
comes
from
a
country
where
women
are
not
beings
but
things
chattels
with
which
one
does
as
one
wills
which
one
buys
sells
and
slays
in
short
which
one
uses
for
one
s
caprices
as
you
here
use
a
piece
of
furniture
besides
she
has
one
passion
which
dominates
all
the
others
and
which
would
have
stifled
her
maternal
love
even
if
she
had
loved
her
daughter
a
passion
what
henri
asked
quickly
interrupting
his
sister
play
god
keep
you
from
it
answered
the
marquise
but
whom
have
you
said
henri
looking
at
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
who
will
help
you
to
remove
the
traces
of
this
fantasy
which
the
law
would
not
overlook
i
have
her
mother
replied
the
marquise
designating
the
georgian
to
whom
she
made
a
sign
to
remain
we
shall
meet
again
said
henri
who
was
thinking
anxiously
of
his
friends
and
felt
that
it
was
time
to
leave
no
brother
she
said
we
shall
not
meet
again
i
am
going
back
to
spain
to
enter
the
convent
of
you
are
too
young
yet
too
lovely
said
henri
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
giving
her
a
kiss
she
said
there
is
no
consolation
when
you
have
lost
that
which
has
seemed
to
you
