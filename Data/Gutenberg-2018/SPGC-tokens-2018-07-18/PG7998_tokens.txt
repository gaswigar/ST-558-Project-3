aristophanes
greatest
of
comic
writers
in
greek
and
in
the
opinion
of
many
in
any
language
is
the
only
one
of
the
attic
comedians
any
of
whose
works
has
survived
in
complete
form
he
was
born
in
athens
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
b
c
and
had
his
first
comedy
produced
when
he
was
so
young
that
his
name
was
withheld
on
account
of
his
youth
he
is
credited
with
over
forty
plays
eleven
of
which
survive
along
with
the
names
and
fragments
of
some
others
his
satire
deal
with
political
religious
and
literary
topics
and
with
all
its
humor
and
fancy
is
evidently
the
outcome
of
profound
conviction
and
a
genuine
patriotism
the
attic
comedy
was
produced
at
the
festivals
of
dionysus
which
were
marked
by
great
license
and
to
this
rather
than
to
the
individual
taste
of
the
poet
must
be
ascribed
the
undoubted
coarseness
of
many
of
the
jests
aristophanes
seems
indeed
to
have
been
regarded
by
his
contemporaries
as
a
man
of
noble
character
he
died
shortly
after
the
production
of
his
plutus
in
the
frogs
was
produced
the
year
after
the
death
of
euripides
and
laments
the
decay
of
greek
tragedy
which
aristophanes
attributed
to
that
writer
it
is
an
admirable
example
of
the
brilliance
of
his
style
and
of
that
mingling
of
wit
and
poetry
with
rollicking
humor
and
keen
satirical
point
which
is
his
chief
characteristic
here
as
elsewhere
he
stands
for
tradition
against
innovation
of
all
kinds
whether
in
politics
religion
or
art
the
hostility
to
euripides
displayed
here
and
in
several
other
plays
like
his
attacks
on
socrates
is
a
result
of
this
attitude
of
conservatism
the
present
play
is
notable
also
as
a
piece
of
elaborate
if
not
literary
criticism

the
pen
of

great

throng

thousand
abide
with
more
than
a

on

lips
of
that
foreigner

of

the
bane

disgrace

is
shrieking
his
kinsman

garrulous
swallow
of

perch
of
exotic
descent
rejoicing
her
sorrow
to
vent

pours
to

spirit

a
nightingale
woeful
lament
that
though
the
voting
be
equal
his
ruin
will
soon
be
the
sequel
well
it
suits
the
holy
chorus
evermore
with
counsel

to
exhort

teach
the
city
this
we
therefore
now
advise
end
the
townsmen
apprehensions
equalize
the
rights
of
all

by
phrynichus
wrestlings
some
perchance
sustained
a
fall

to
these
is
surely
open
having
put
away
their
sin
for
their
slips
and
vacillations
pardon
at
your
hands
to
win
give
your
brethren
back
their
franchise
sin
and
shame
it
were
that
slaves
who
have
once
with
stern
devotion
fought
your
battle
on
the
waves
should
be
straightway
lords
and
masters
yea
plataeans
fully
blown
not
that
this
deserves
our
censure
there
i
praise
you
there
alone
has
the
city
in
her
anguish
policy
and
wisdom
shown
nay
but
these
of
old
accustomed
on
our
ships
to
fight
and
win
they
their
father
too
before
them
these
our
very
kith
and
kin
you
should
likewise
when
they
ask
you
pardon
for
their
single
sin
o
by
nature
best
and
wisest
o
relax
your
jealous
ire
let
us
all
the
world
as
kinsfolk
and
as
citizens
acquire
all
who
on
our
ships
will
battle
well
and
bravely
by
our
side
if
we
cocker
up
our
city
narrowing
her
with
senseless
pride
now
when
she
is
rocked
and
reeling
in
the
cradles
of
the
sea
here
again
will
after
ages
deem
we
acted
brainlessly
and
o
if
i
able
to
scan
the
habits
and
life
of
a
man
who
shall
rue
his
iniquities
soon
not
long
shall
that
little
baboon
that
cleigenes
shifty

small

wickedest
bathman
of

of
the
earth

is
brought
from
the
isle
of
cimolus
and
wrought
with
nitre
and
lye
into
soap
not
long
shall
he
vex
us
i
hope
and
this
the
unlucky
one
knows
yet
ventures
a
peace
to
oppose
and
being
addicted
to
blows
he
carries
a
stick
as
he
goes
lest
while
he
is
tipsy
and
reeling
some
robber
his
cloak
should
be
stealing
often
has
it
crossed
my
fancy
that
the
city
loves
to
deal
with
the
very
best
and
noblest
members
of
her
commonweal
just
as
with
our
ancient
coinage
and
the
gold
yea
for
these
our
sterling
pieces
all
of
pure
athenian
mould
all
of
perfect
die
and
metal
all
the
fairest
of
the
fair
all
of
workmanship
unequalled
proved
and
valued
both
amongst
our
own
hellenes
and
barbarians
far
away
these
we
use
not
but
the
worthless
pinchbeck
coins
of
yesterday
vilest
die
and
basest
metal
now
we
always
use
instead
even
so
our
sterling
townsmen
nobly
born
and
nobly
bred
men
of
worth
and
rank
and
metal
men
of
honourable
fame
trained
in
every
liberal
science
choral
dance
and
manly
game
these
we
treat
with
scorn
and
insult
but
the
strangers
newliest
come
worthless
sons
of
worthless
fathers
pinchbeck
townsmen
yellowy
scum
whom
in
earlier
days
the
city
hardly
would
have
stooped
to
use

for
her
scapegoat
victims
these
for
every
task
we
choose
o
unwise
and
foolish
people
yet
to
mend
your
ways
begin

why
what
the
matter
aeac
there
a
custom
here
with
all
the
crafts
the
good
and
noble
crafts
that
the
chief
master
of

in

shall
have
his
dinner
in

hall
and
sit
by
pluto
side
xan
i
understand
aeac
until
another
comes
more
wise
than
he
in
the
same
art
then
must
the
first
give
way
xan
and
how
has
this
disturbed
our
aeschylus
aeac
was
he
that
occupied
the
tragic
chair
as
in
his
craft
the
noblest
xan
who
does
now
aeac
but
when
euripides
came
down
he
kept
flourishing
off
before
the
highwaymen
thieves
burglars
parricides
these
form
our
mob
in
hades
till
with
listening
to
his
twists
and
turns
and
pleas
and
counterpleas
they
went
mad
on
the
man
and
hailed
him
first
and
wisest
elate
with
this
he
claimed
the
tragic
chair
where
aeschylus
was
seated
xan
was
he
pelted
aeac
not
he
the
populace
clamoured
out
to
try
which
of
the
twain
was
wiser
in
his
art
xan
you
mean
the
rascals
aeac
aye
as
high
as
heaven
xan
but
were
there
none
to
side
with
aeschylus
aeac
scanty
and
sparse
the
good
the
the
same
as
here
xan
and
what
does
pluto
now
propose
to
do
aeac
he
means
to
hold
a
tournament
and
bring
their
tragedies
to
the
proof
xan
but
sophocles
how
came
not
he
to
claim
the
tragic
chair
aeac
claim
it
not
he
when
came
down
he
kissed
with
reverence
aeschylus
and
clasped
his
hand
and
yielded
willingly
the
chair
to
him
but
now
he
going
says
cleidemides
to
sit
and
then
if
aeschylus
win
he
stay
content
if
not
for
his
art
sake
he
fight
to
the
death
against
euripides
xan
will
it
come
off
aeac
o
yes
by
zeus
directly
and
then
i
hear
will
wonderful
things
be
done
the
art
poetic
will
be
weighed
in
scales
xan
what
weigh
out
tragedy
like
butcher
meat
aeac
levels
they
bring
and
for
words
and
moulded
oblongs
xan
is
it
bricks
they
are
making
aeac
wedges
and
compasses
for
euripides
vows
that
he
test
the
dramas
word
by
word
xan
aeschylus
chafes
at
this
i
fancy
aeac
well
he
lowered
his
brows
upglaring
like
a
bull
xan
and
who
to
be
the
judge
aeac
there
came
the
rub
skilled
men
were
hard
to
find
for
with
the
athenians
aeschylus
somehow
did
not
hit
it
off
xan
too
many
burglars
i
expect
he
thought
aeac
and
all
the
rest
he
said
were
trash
and
nonsense
to
judge
poetic
wits
so
then
at
last
they
chose
your
lord
an
expert
in
the
art
but
go
we
in
for
when
our
lords
are
bent
on
urgent
business
that
means
blows
for

o
surely
with
terrible
wrath
will
the
monarch
be
filled
when
he
sees
his
opponent
beside
him
the
tonguester
the
stand
whetting
his
tusks
for
the
fight
o
surely
his
eyes
will
with
terrible
madness
be
fraught
o
then
will
be
charging
of
words
with
their
mane
and
then
will
be
whirling
of
splinters
and
phrases
smoothed
down
with
the
plane
when
the
man
would
the
maxims
the
language
gigantic
repel
of
the
of

there
will
his
crest
upbristle
for
anger

woe

his
fury
will
launch
at
the
foe
masses
of
words

exertion
titanic
up
tearing

planks
for

here
will
the
tongue
be
at
work

detracting

envious

embittered

will
scatter
a

of

now
then
commence
your

you
both
display
true
wit
not
metaphors
nor
things
which
any
fool
could
say
eur
as
for
myself
good
people
all
i
tell
you
my
own
poetic
worth
and
claims
but
first
of
all
i
try
to
show
how
this
portentous
quack
beguiled
the
silly
fools
whose
tastes
were
nurtured
ere
he
came
in
phrynichus
schools
he
bring
some
single
mourner
on
seated
and
veiled
be
achilles
say
or
niobe
the
face
you
could
not
see
an
empty
show
of
tragic
woe
who
uttered
not
one
thing
dio
tis
true
eur
then
in
the
chorus
came
and
rattled
off
a
string
of
four
continuous
lyric
odes
the
mourner
never
stirred
dio
i
liked
it
too
i
sometimes
think
that
i
those
mutes
preferred
to
all
your
chatterers
eur
because
if
you
must
know
you
were
an
ass
dio
an
ass
no
doubt
what
made
him
do
it
though
eur
that
was
his
quackery
do
you
see
to
set
the
audience
guessing
when
niobe
would
speak
meanwhile
the
drama
was
progressing
dio
the
rascal
how
he
took
me
in
was
shameful
was
it
not
what
makes
you
stamp
and
fidget
so
eur
he
catching
it
so
hot
so
when
he
had
humbugged
thus
awhile
and
now
his
wretched
play
was
halfway
through
a
dozen
words
great
words
he
say
fierce
bugaboos
with
bristling
crests
and
shaggy
eyebrows
too
which
not
a
soul
could
understand
aesch
o
heavens
dio
be
quiet
do
eur
but
not
one
single
word
was
clear
dio
st
do
your
teeth
be
gnashing

was
all
scamanders
moated

and
flashing
in
burnished
copper
on

expressions
hard
to
comprehend
dio
aye
by
the
powers
and
i
full
many
a
sleepless
night
have
spent
in
anxious
thought
because
i
find
the
tawny

sort
of

was
aesch
it
was
a
sign
you
stupid
dolt
engraved

supposed
it
was
philoxenus

eur
now
really
should
a
cock
be
brought
into
a
tragic
play
aesch
you
enemy
of

what
was
practice
pray
eur
no
in

by

no
there
see
such
figures
as
are
blazoned
forth
in

when
first
i
took
the
art
from

bloated
and
swoln
poor

with
turgid
gasconading
words
and
heavy
dieting
first
i
reduced
and
toned
her
down
and
made
her
slim
and
neat
with
wordlets
and
with
exercise
and
poultices
of
beet
and
next
a
dose
of
chatterjuice
distilled
from
books
i
gave
her
and
monodies
she
took
with
sharp
cephisophon
for
flavour
i
never
used
haphazard
words
or
plunged
abruptly
in

explained
at
large
the

and

its
source
i
really
trust

better
than

then
from
the
very
opening
lines
no
idleness
was
shown
the
mistress
talked
with
all
her

the
servant
talked
as
much

then
next
i
taught
all

i
would

mischief

you
did

i
showed

out

now
the

trace
the

better

high
verse
to

and
tragic

from

to
raise
pour
forth
thy

with

aesch
my
wrath
is
hot
at
this
vile
mischance
and
my
spirit
revolts
at
the
thought
that
i
must
bandy
words
with
a
fellow
like
but
lest
he
should
vaunt
that
i
ca
reply
come
tell
me
what
are
the
points
for
which
a
noble
poet
our
praise
obtains
eur
for
his
ready
wit
and
his
counsels
sage
and
because
the
citizen
folk
he
trains
to
be
better
townsmen
and
worthier
men
aesch
if
then
you
have
done
the
very
reverse
found
and
virtuous
men
and
altered
them
each
and
all
for
the
worse
pray
what
is
the
need
you
deserve
to
get
dio
nay
ask
not
he
deserves
to
die
aesch
for
just
consider
what
style
of
men
he
received
from
me
great
heroical
souls
who
never
would
blench
from
a
townsman
duties
in
peace
or
war
not
idle
loafers
or
low
buffoons
or
rascally
scamps
such
as
now
they
are
but
men
who
were
breathing
spears
and
helms
and
the
plume
in
its
crested
pride
the
greave
and
the
dart
and
the
warrior
heart
in
its
casing
of
tough
dio
he
stun
me
i
know
with
his
this
business
is
going
from
bad
to
worse
eur
and
how
did
you
manage
to
make
them
so
grand
exalted
and
brave
with
your
wonderful
verse
dio
come
aeschylus
answer
and
do
stand
mute
in
your
pride
and
arrogant
spleen
aesch
a
drama
i
wrote
with
the
filled
dio
its
name
aesch
is
the
seven
against
thebes
that
i
mean
which
who
so
beheld
with
eagerness
swelled
to
rush
to
the
battlefield
there
and
then
dio
o
that
was
a
scandalous
thing
you
did
you
have
made
the
thebans
mightier
men
more
eager
by
far
for
the
business
of
war
now
therefore
receive
this
punch
on
the
head
aesch
ah
might
have
practised
the
same
yourselves
but
ye
turned
to
other
pursuits
instead
then
next
the
persians
i
wrote
in
praise
of
the
noblest
deed
that
the
world
can
show
and
each
man
longed
for
the
victor
wreath
to
fight
and
to
vanquish
his
country
foe
dio
i
was
pleased
i
own
when
i
heard
their
moan
for
old
darius
their
great
king
dead
when
they
smote
together
their
hands
like
this
and
the
chorus
said
aesch
aye
such
are
the
poet
appropriate
works
and
just
consider
how
all
along
from
the
very
first
they
have
wrought
you
good
the
noble
bards
the
masters
of
song
first
orpheus
taught
you
religious
rites
and
from
bloody
murder
to
stay
your
hands
musaeus
healing
and
oracle
lore
and
hesiod
all
the
culture
of

the
time
to
gather
the
time
to
plough
and
gat
not
homer
his
glory
divine
by
singing
of
valour
and
honour
and
right
and
the
sheen
of
the
line
the
ranging
of
troops
and
the
arming
of
men
dio
o
ay
but
he
did
teach
i
opine
to
pantacles
when
he
was
leading
the
show
i
could
imagine
what
he
was
at
he
had
fastened
his
helm
on
the
top
of
his
head
he
was
trying
to
fasten
his
plume
upon
that
aesch
but
others
many
and
brave
he
taught
of
whom
was
lamachus
hero

and
thence
my
spirit
the
impress
took
and
many

phaedras

stheneboeas

no

and
none
can

that
ever
i
drew
a

for

pat
you
showed
how

and
lo
you
were
struck
yourself
by
the
very

fate
eur
but
say
you
censor
of
mine
how
stheneboeas
could
harm
the
state
aesch
full
many
a
noble

the
wife
of
a
noble
citizen
hemlock
took
and
died
unable
the
shame
and
sin
of
your
bellerophonscenes
to
brook
eur
was
then
i
wonder
the
tale
i
told
of
phaedra
passionate
love
untrue
aesch
not
so
but
tales
of
incestuous
vice
the
sacred
poet
should
hide
from
view
nor
ever
exhibit
and
blazon
forth
on
the
public
stage
to
the
public
ken
for
boys
a
teacher
at
school
is
found
but
we
the
poets
are
teachers
of
men
we
are
bound
things
honest
and
pure
to
speak
eur
and
to
speak
great
lycabettuses
pray
and
massive
blocks
of
parnassian
rocks
is
things
honest
and
pure
to
say
in
human
fashion
we
ought
to
speak
aesch
alas
poor
witling
and
ca
you
see
that
for
mighty
thoughts
and
heroic
aims
the
words
themselves
must
appropriate
be
and
grander
belike
on
the
ear
should
strike
the
speech
of
heroes
and
godlike
powers
since
even
the
robes
that
invest
their
limbs
are
statelier
grander
robes
than
ours
such
was
plan
but
when
began
you
spoilt
and
degraded
it
all
eur
how
so
aesch
your
kings
in
tatters
and
rags
you
dressed
and
brought
them
on
a
beggarly
show
to
move
forsooth
our
pity
and
ruth
eur
and
what
was
the
harm
i
should
like
to
know
aesch
no
more
will
a
wealthy
citizen
now
equip
for
the
state
a
galley
of
war
he
wraps
his
limbs
in
tatters
and
rags
and
whines
is
poor
too
poor
by
dio
but
under
his
rags
he
is
wearing
a
vest
as
woolly
and
soft
as
a
man
could
wish
let
him
gull
the
state
and
he
off
to
the
mart
an
eager
extravagant
buyer
of
fish
aesch
moreover
to
prate
to
harangue
to
debate
is
now
the
ambition
of
all
in
the
state
each
is
in
consequence
found
deserted
and
empty
to
evil
repute
your
lessons
have
brought
our
youngsters
and
taught
our
sailors
to
challenge
discuss
and
refute
the
orders
they
get
from
their
captains
and
yet
when
was
alive
i
protest
that
the
knaves
knew
nothing
at
all
save
for
rations
to
call
and
to
sing
rhyppapae
as
they
pulled
through
the
waves
dio
and
bedad
to
let
fly
from
their
sterns
in
the
eye
of
the
fellow
who
tugged
at
the
undermost
oar
and
a
jolly
young
messmate
with
filth
to
besmirch
and
to
land
for
a
filching
adventure
ashore
but
now
they
harangue
and
dispute
and
wo
row
and
idly
and
aimlessly
float
to
and
fro
aesch
of
what
ills
is
he
not
the
creator
and
cause
consider
the
scandalous
scenes
that
he
draws
his
bawds
and
his
panders
his
women
who
give
give
birth
in
the
sacredest
shrine
whilst
others
with
brothers
are
wedded
and
bedded
and
others
opine
that
not
to
be
living
is
truly
to
live
and
therefore
our
city
is
swarming
with
clerks
and
with
who
play
their
jackanape
tricks
at
all
times
in
all
places
deluding
the
people
of
athens
but
none
has
training
enough
in
athletics
to
run
with
the
torch
in
his
hand
at
the
races
dio
by
the
powers
you
are
right
at
the
panathenaea
i
laughed
till
i
felt
like
a
potsherd
to
see
a
pale
paunchy
young
gentleman
pounding
along
with
his
head
butting
forward
the
last
of
the
throng
in
the
direst
of
straits
and
behold
at
the
gates
the
ceramites
flapped
him
and
smacked
him
and
slapped
him
in
the
ribs
and
the
loin
and
the
flank
and
the
groin
and
still
as
they
spanked
him
he
puffed
and
he
panted
till
at
one
mighty
cuff
he
discharged
such
a
puff
that
he
blew
out
his
torch
and
levanted
