the
early
day
in
the
northwest
by
john
kinzie
of
chicago
if
we
but
knew
the
exact
meaning
of
the
word
we
should
be
the
dawn
the
break
of
day
philadelphia
preface
every
work
partaking
of
the
nature
of
an
autobiography
is
supposed
to
demand
an
apology
to
the
public
to
refuse
such
a
tribute
would
be
to
recognize
the
justice
of
the
charge
so
often
brought
against
our
countrymen
of
a
too
great
willingness
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
domestic
history
and
private
affairs
of
their
neighbors
it
is
doubtless
to
refute
this
calumny
that
we
find
travellers
for
the
most
part
modestly
offering
some
such
form
of
explanation
as
this
to
the
reader
that
the
matter
laid
before
him
was
in
the
first
place
simply
letters
to
friends
never
designed
to
be
submitted
to
other
eyes
and
only
brought
forward
now
at
the
solicitation
of
wiser
judges
than
the
author
himself
no
such
plea
can
in
the
present
instance
be
offered
the
record
of
events
in
which
the
writer
had
herself
no
share
was
preserved
in
compliance
with
the
suggestion
of
a
revered
relative
whose
name
often
appears
in
the
following
pages
my
child
she
would
say
write
these
things
down
as
i
tell
them
to
you
hereafter
our
children
and
even
strangers
will
feel
interested
in
hearing
the
story
of
our
early
lives
and
sufferings
and
it
is
a
matter
of
no
small
regret
and
that
much
very
much
thus
narrated
was
through
negligence
or
a
spirit
of
procrastination
suffered
to
pass
unrecorded
with
regard
to
the
pictures
of
domestic
life
and
experience
preserved
as
will
be
seen
in
journals
letters
and
otherwise
it
is
true
their
publication
might
have
been
deferred
until
the
writer
had
passed
away
from
the
scene
of
action
and
such
it
was
supposed
would
have
been
their
lot
that
they
would
only
have
been
dragged
forth
hereafter
to
show
to
a
succeeding
generation
what
the
early
day
of
our
western
homes
had
been
it
never
entered
the
anticipations
of
the
most
sanguine
that
the
march
of
improvement
and
prosperity
would
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
have
so
obliterated
the
traces
of
the
first
beginning
that
a
vast
and
intelligent
multitude
would
be
crying
out
for
information
in
regard
to
the
early
settlement
of
this
portion
of
our
country
which
so
few
are
left
to
furnish
an
opinion
has
been
expressed
that
a
comparison
of
the
present
times
with
those
that
are
past
would
enable
our
young
people
emigrating
from
their
luxurious
homes
at
the
east
to
bear
in
a
spirit
of
patience
and
contentment
the
slight
privations
and
hardships
they
are
at
this
day
called
to
meet
with
if
in
one
instance
this
should
be
the
case
the
writer
may
well
feel
happy
to
have
incurred
even
the
charge
of
egotism
in
giving
thus
much
of
her
own
history
it
may
be
objected
that
all
that
is
strictly
personal
might
have
been
more
modestly
put
forth
under
the
name
of
a
third
person
or
that
the
events
themselves
and
the
scenes
might
have
been
described
while
those
participating
in
them
might
have
been
kept
more
in
the
background
in
the
first
case
the
narrative
would
have
lost
its
air
of
truth
and
reality
in
the
second
the
experiment
would
merely
have
been
tried
of
dressing
up
a
theatre
for
representation
and
omitting
the
actors
some
who
read
the
following
sketches
may
be
inclined
to
believe
that
a
residence
among
our
native
brethren
and
an
attachment
growing
out
of
our
peculiar
relation
to
them
have
exaggerated
our
sympathies
and
our
sense
of
the
wrongs
they
have
received
at
the
hands
of
the
whites
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
that
point
there
is
a
tribunal
at
which
man
shall
be
judged
for
that
which
he
has
meted
out
to
his
may
our
countrymen
take
heed
that
their
legislation
shall
never
unfit
them
to
appear
with
joy
and
not
with
grief

that
tribunal

the

chapter
i
departure
from
detroit
it
was
on
a
dark
rainy
evening
in
the
month
of
september
that
we
went
on
board
the
steamer
henry
clay
to
take
passage
for
green
bay
all
our
friends
in
detroit
had
congratulated
us
upon
our
good
fortune
in
being
spared
the
voyage
in
one
of
the
little
schooners
which
at
this
time
afforded
the
ordinary
means
of
communication
with
the
few
and
distant
settlements
on
lakes
huron
and
michigan
each
one
had
some
experience
to
relate
of
his
own
or
of
his
mischances
in
these
precarious
journeys
long
detentions
on
the
clair
flats
furious
off
thunder
bay
or
interminable
calms
at
mackinac
or
the
manitous
that
which
most
enhanced
our
sense
of
peculiar
good
luck
was
the
true
story
of
one
of
our
relatives
having
left
detroit
in
the
month
of
june
and
reached
chicago
in
the
september
following
having
been
actually
three
months
in
performing
what
is
sometimes
accomplished
by
even
a
in
four
days
but
the
certainty
of
encountering
similar
misadventures
would
have
weighed
little
with
me
i
was
now
to
visit
nay
more
to
become
a
resident
of
that
land
which
had
for
long
years
been
to
me
a
region
of
romance
since
the
time
when
as
a
child
my
highest
delight
had
been
in
the
letters
of
a
dear
relative
describing
to
me
his
home
and
mode
of
life
in
the
indian
country
and
still
later
in
his
felicitous
narration
of
a
tour
with
general
cass
in
to
the
sources
of
the
mississippi
nay
even
earlier
in
the
days
when
i
stood
at
my
knee
and
spelled
out
the
long
word
that
distant
land
with
its
vast
lakes
its
boundless
prairies
and
its
mighty
forests
had
possessed
a
wonderful
charm
for
my
imagination
now
i
was
to
see
it
it
was
to
be
my
home
our
ride
to
the
quay
through
the
dark
in
a
cart
the
only
vehicle
which
at
that
day
could
navigate
the
muddy
unpaved
streets
of
detroit
was
a
theme
for
much
merriment
and
not
less
so
our
descent
of
the
narrow
perpendicular
by
which
we
reached
the
little
apartment
called
the
ladies
cabin
we
were
highly
delighted
with
the
accommodations
which
by
comparison
seemed
the
very
climax
of
comfort
and
convenience
more
especially
as
the
occupants
of
the
cabin
consisted
beside
myself
of
but
a
lady
and
two
little
girls
nothing
could
exceed
the
pleasantness
of
our
trip
for
the
first
hours
there
were
some
officers
old
friends
among
the
passengers
we
had
plenty
of
books
the
gentlemen
read
aloud
occasionally
admired
the
solitary
magnificence
of
the
scenery
around
us
the
primeval
woods
or
the
vast
expanse
of
water
unenlivened
by
a
single
sail
and
then
betook
themselves
to
their
cigar
or
their
game
of
euchre
to
while
away
the
hours
for
a
time
the
passage
over
thunder
bay
was
delightful
but
alas
it
was
not
destined
in
our
favor
to
belie
its
name
a
storm
came
on
fast
and
furious
what
was
worse
it
was
of
long
duration
the
pitching
and
rolling
of
the
little
boat
the
closeness
and
even
the
we
bore
as
became
us
they
were
what
we
had
expected
and
were
prepared
for
but
a
new
feature
of
discomfort
appeared
which
almost
upset
our
philosophy
the
rain
which
fell
in
torrents
soon
made
its
way
through
every
seam
and
pore
of
deck
or
moulding
down
the
through
the
joints
and
crevices
it
came
saturating
first
the
carpet
then
the
bedding
until
finally
we
were
completely
driven
by
stress
of
weather
into
the
gentlemen
cabin
way
was
made
for
us
very
gallantly
and
every
provision
resorted
to
for
our
comfort
and
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
on
having
found
a
haven
in
our
distress
when
lo
the
seams
above
opened
and
down
upon
our
devoted
heads
poured
such
a
flood
that
even
umbrellas
were
an
insufficient
protection
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
ladies
and
children
but
to
betake
ourselves
to
the
berths
which
in
this
apartment
fortunately
remained
dry
and
here
we
continued
ensconced
the
livelong
day
our
dinner
was
served
up
to
us
on
our
pillows
the
gentlemen
chose
the
dryest
spots
raised
their
umbrellas
and
sat
under
them
telling
amusing
anecdotes
and
saying
funny
things
to
cheer
us
until
the
rain
ceased
and
at
nine
in
the
evening
we
were
gladdened
by
the
intelligence
that
we
had
reached
the
pier
at
mackinac
we
were
received
with
the
most
affectionate
cordiality
by
and
robert
stuart
at
whose
hospitable
mansion
we
had
been
for
some
days
expected
the
repose
and
comfort
of
an
asylum
like
this
can
be
best
appreciated
by
those
who
have
reached
it
after
a
tossing
and
drenching
such
as
ours
had
been
a
bright
warm
fire
and
countenances
beaming
with
kindest
interest
dispelled
all
sensations
of
fatigue
or
annoyance
after
a
season
of
pleasant
conversation
the
servants
were
assembled
the
chapter
of
god
word
was
solemnly
read
the
hymn
chanted
the
prayer
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
offered
and
we
were
conducted
to
our
place
of
repose
it
is
not
my
purpose
here
to
attempt
a
portrait
of
those
noble
friends
whom
i
thus
met
for
the
first
time
to
an
abler
pen
than
mine
should
be
assigned
the
honor
of
writing
the
biography
of
robert
stuart
all
who
have
enjoyed
the
happiness
of
his
acquaintance
or
still
more
a
sojourn
under
his
hospitable
roof
will
carry
with
them
to
their
latest
hour
the
impression
of
his
noble
bearing
his
genial
humor
his
untiring
benevolence
his
upright
uncompromising
adherence
to
principle
his
ardent
philanthropy
his
noble
disinterestedness
irving
in
his
astoria
and
franchere
in
his
narrative
give
many
striking
traits
of
his
early
character
together
with
events
of
his
history
of
a
thrilling
and
romantic
interest
but
both
have
left
the
most
valuable
portion
unsaid
his
namely
as
a
christian
gentleman
of
his
beloved
partner
who
still
survives
him
mourning
on
her
bereaved
and
solitary
pilgrimage
yet
cheered
by
the
recollection
of
her
long
and
useful
course
as
a
mother
in
israel
we
will
say
no
more
than
to
offer
the
incense
of
loving
hearts
and
prayers
for
the
best
blessings
from
her
father

michilimackinac
that
gem
of
the
lakes
how
bright
and
beautiful
it
looked
as
we
walked
abroad
on
the
following
morning
the
rain
had
passed
away
but
had
left
all
things
glittering
in
the
light
of
the
sun
as
it
rose
up
over
the
waters
of
lake
huron
far
away
to
the
east
before
us
was
the
lovely
bay
scarcely
yet
tranquil
after
the
storm
but
dotted
with
canoes
and
the
boats
of
the
fishermen
already
getting
out
their
nets
for
the
trout
and
whitefish
those
treasures
of
the
deep
along
the
beach
were
scattered
the
wigwams
or
lodges
of
the
ottawas
who
had
come
to
the
island
to
trade
the
inmates
came
forth
to
gaze
upon
us
a
shout
of
welcome
was
sent
forth
as
they
recognized
who
from
a
seven
years
residence
among
them
was
well
known
to
each
individual
a
shake
of
the
hand
and
an
emphatic
is
the
customary
salutation
between
the
indian
and
the
white
man

i
inquired
of
my
husband
no
this
is
a
fashion
they
have
learned
of
the
french
traders
during
many
years
of
intercourse
not
less
hearty
was
the
greeting
of
each
canadian
as
he
trotted
forward
to
pay
his
respects
to
monsieur
john
and
to
utter
a
long
string
of
felicitations
in
a
most
incomprehensible
i
was
forced
to
take
for
granted
all
the
good
wishes
showered
upon
madame
john
of
which
i
could
comprehend
nothing
but
the
hope
that
i
should
be
happy
and
contented
in
my
the
object
of
our
early
walk
was
to
visit
the
and
school
which
had
been
some
few
years
previously
established
at
this
place
by
the
presbyterian
board
of
missions
it
was
an
object
of
especial
interest
to
and
stuart
and
its
flourishing
condition
at
this
period
and
the
prospects
of
extensive
future
usefulness
it
held
out
might
well
gladden
their
philanthropic
hearts
they
had
lived
many
years
on
the
island
and
had
witnessed
its
transformation
through
blessing
on
christian
efforts
from
a
worldly
dissipated
community
to
one
of
which
it
might
almost
be
said
religion
was
every
business
this
mission
establishment
was
the
beloved
child
and
the
common
centre
of
interest
of
the
few
protestant
families
clustered
around
it
through
the
zeal
and
good
management
of
and
mrs
ferry
and
the
fostering
encouragement
of
the
congregation
the
school
was
in
great
repute
and
it
was
pleasant
to
observe
the
effect
of
mental
and
religious
culture
in
subduing
the
mischievous
tricky
propensities
of
the
and
rousing
the
stolid
apathy
of
the
genuine
indian
these
were
the
palmy
days
of
mackinac
as
the
of
the
american
fur
company
and
the
entrepôt
of
the
whole
northwest
all
the
trade
in
supplies
and
goods
on
the
one
hand
and
in
furs
and
products
of
the
indian
country
on
the
other
was
in
the
hands
of
the
parent
establishment
or
its
numerous
outposts
scattered
along
lakes
superior
and
michigan
the
mississippi
or
through
still
more
distant
regions
probably
few
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
all
the
indian
tribes
with
the
exception
of
the
miamis
and
the
wyandots
had
since
the
transfer
of
the
old
french
possessions
to
the
british
crown
maintained
a
firm
alliance
with
the
latter
the
independence
achieved
by
the
united
states
did
not
alter
the
policy
of
the
natives
nor
did
our
government
succeed
in
winning
or
purchasing
their
friendship
great
britain
it
is
true
bid
high
to
retain
them
every
year
the
leading
men
of
the
chippewas
ottawas
pottowattamies
menomonees
winnebagoes
sauks
and
foxes
and
even
still
more
remote
tribes
journeyed
from
their
distant
homes
to
fort
malden
in
upper
canada
to
receive
their
annual
amount
of
presents
from
their
great
father
across
the
water
it
was
a
thus
to
keep
them
in
pay
and
had
enabled
those
who
practised
it
to
do
fearful
execution
through
the
aid
of
such
allies
in
the
last
war
between
the
two
countries
the
presents
they
thus
received
were
of
considerable
value
consisting
of
blankets
broadcloths
or
calicoes
guns
kettles
traps
comprising
bracelets
brooches
and
combs
and
various
other
trinkets
distributed
with
no
niggardly
hand
the
magazines
and
of
the
fur
company
at
mackinac
were
the
resort
of
all
the
upper
tribes
for
the
sale
of
their
commodities
and
the
purchase
of
all
such
articles
as
they
had
need
of
including
those
above
enumerated
and
also
ammunition
which
as
well
as
money
and
liquor
their
british
friends
very
commendably
omitted
to
furnish
them
besides
their
furs
various
in
kind
and
often
of
great
value
beaver
otter
marten
mink
and
red
fox
wolf
bear
and
and
smoked
the
indians
brought
for
trade
in
abundance
considerable
quantities
of
both
indian
corn
and
beans
and
the
or
wild
rice
while
the
squaws
added
to
their
quota
of
merchandise
a
contribution
in
the
form
of
moccasins
mococks
or
little
boxes
of
embroidered
with
and
filled
with
mats
of
a
neat
and
durable
fabric
and
of
indian
cradles
canoes
etc
it
was
no
unusual
thing
at
this
period
to
see
a
hundred
or
more
canoes
of
indians
at
once
approaching
the
island
laden
with
their
articles
of
traffic
and
if
to
these
we
add
the
squadrons
of
large
mackinac
boats
constantly
arriving
from
the
outposts
with
the
furs
peltries
and
collected
by
the
distant
traders
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
extensive
operations
and
important
position
of
the
american
fur
company
as
well
as
of
the
vast
circle
of
human
beings
either
immediately
or
remotely
connected
with
it
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
philanthropic
mind
surveying
these
races
of
uncultivated
heathen
should
stretch
forward
to
the
time
when
through
an
unwearied
devotion
of
the
white
man
energies
and
an
untiring
sacrifice
of
self
and
fortune
his
red
brethren
might
rise
in
the
scale
of
social
civilization
when
education
and
christianity
should
go
hand
in
hand
to
make
the
wilderness
blossom
as
the
rose
little
did
the
noble
souls
at
that
day
rejoicing
in
the
success
of
their
labors
at
mackinac
anticipate
that
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
there
would
remain
of
all
these
numerous
tribes
but
a
few
scattered
bands
squalid
degraded
with
scarce
a
vestige
remaining
of
their
former
lofty
character
their
lands
cajoled
or
wrested
from
them
the
graves
of
their
fathers
turned
up
by
the
ploughshare
themselves
chased
farther
and
farther
towards
the
setting
sun
until
they
were
literally
grudged
a
on
the
face
of
the
earth
our
visit
to
the
was
of
short
duration
for
the
henry
clay
was
to
leave
at
two
and
in
the
mean
time
we
were
to
see
what
we
could
of
the
village
and
its
environs
and
after
that
dine
with
mitchell
an
old
friend
of
my
husband
as
we
walked
leisurely
along
over
the
white
gravelly
road
many
of
the
residences
of
the
old
inhabitants
were
pointed
out
to
me
there
was
the
dwelling
of
madame
laframboise
an
ottawa
woman
whose
husband
had
taught
her
to
read
and
write
and
who
had
ever
after
continued
to
use
the
knowledge
she
had
acquired
for
the
instruction
and
improvement
of
the
youth
among
her
own
people
it
was
her
custom
to
receive
a
class
of
young
pupils
daily
at
her
house
that
she
might
give
them
lessons
in
the
branches
mentioned
and
also
in
the
principles
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
to
which
she
was
deeply
devoted
she
was
a
woman
of
a
vast
deal
of
energy
and
enterprise
of
a
tall
and
commanding
figure
and
most
dignified
deportment
after
the
death
of
her
husband
who
was
killed
while
away
at
his
by
a
winnebago
named
she
was
accustomed
to
visit
herself
the
superintend
the
clerks
and
engagés
and
satisfy
herself
that
the
business
was
carried
on
in
a
regular
and
profitable
manner
the
with
its
unusual
luxuries
of
piazza
and
gardens
was
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
the
fort
was
built
it
was
a
lovely
spot
notwithstanding
the
stunted
and
dwarfish
appearance
of
all
cultivated
vegetation
in
this
cold
northern
latitude
the
collection
of
rickety
buildings
occupied
by
the
officials
of
the
fur
company
reflected
no
great
credit
on
the
architectural
skill
of
my
husband
who
had
superintended
their
construction
he
told
me
when
little
more
than
a
boy
there
were
besides
these
the
residences
of
the
dousmans
the
abbotts
the
biddles
the
drews
and
the
lashleys
stretching
away
along
the
base
of
the
beautiful
hill
crowned
with
the
white
walls
and
buildings
of
the
fort
the
ascent
to
which
was
so
steep
that
on
the
precipitous
face
nearest
the
beach
staircases
were
built
by
which
to
mount
from
below
my
head
ached
intensely
the
effect
of
the
motion
of
the
boat
on
the
previous
day
but
i
did
not
like
to
give
up
to
it
so
after
i
had
been
shown
all
that
could
be
seen
of
the
little
settlement
in
the
short
time
allowed
us
we
repaired
to
mitchell
we
were
received
by
an
extremely
pretty
delicate
woman
part
french
and
part
sioux
whose
early
life
had
been
passed
at
prairie
du
chien
on
the
mississippi
she
had
been
a
great
belle
among
the
young
officers
at
fort
crawford
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
suicide
of
the
was
attributed
to
an
unsuccessful
attachment
he
had
conceived
for
her
i
was
greatly
struck
with
her
soft
and
gentle
manners
and
the
musical
intonation
of
her
voice
which
i
soon
learned
was
a
distinguishing
peculiarity
of
those
women
in
whom
are
united
the
french
and
native
blood
a
lady
then
upon
a
visit
to
the
mission
was
of
the
company
she
insisted
on
my
lying
down
upon
the
sofa
and
ministered
most
kindly
to
my
suffering
head
as
she
sat
by
my
side
and
expatiated
upon
the
new
sphere
opening
before
me
she
inquired
do
you
not
realize
very
strongly
the
entire
deprivation
of
religious
privileges
you
will
be
obliged
to
suffer
in
your
distant
home
the
deprivation
said
i
will
doubtless
be
great
but
not
for
i
shall
have
my
and
though
destitute
of
a
church
we
need
not
be
without
a
of
worship
how
often
afterwards
when
cheered
by
the
consolations
of
that
precious
book
in
the
midst
of
the
lonely
wilderness
did
i
remember
this
conversation
and
bless
god
that
i
could
never
while
retaining
it
be
without
religious
privileges
we
had
not
yet
left
the
when
the
bell
of
the
little
steamer
sounded
to
summon
us
on
board
and
we
bade
a
hurried
farewell
to
all
our
kind
friends
bearing
with
us
their
hearty
wishes
for
a
safe
and
prosperous
voyage
a
finer
sight
can
scarcely
be
imagined
than
mackinac
from
the
water
as
we
steamed
away
from
the
shore
the
view
came
full
upon
us
the
sloping
beach
with
the
scattered
wigwams
and
canoes
drawn
up
here
and
there
the
irregular
houses
the
white
walls
of
the
fort
and
beyond
one
eminence
still
more
lofty
crowned
with
the
remains
of
old
fort
holmes
the
whole
picture
completed
showed
the
perfect
outline
that
had
given
the
island
its
original
indian
name
the
big
turtle
then
those
pure
living
waters
in
whose
depths
the
fish
might
be
seen
gliding
and
darting
to
and
fro
whose
clearness
is
such
that
an
object
dropped
to
the
bottom
may
be
discerned
at
the
depth
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
a
dollar
lying
far
down
on
its
green
bed
looking
no
larger
than
a
half
dime
i
could
hardly
wonder
at
the
enthusiastic
lady
who
exclaimed
oh
i
could
wish
to
be
drowned
in
these
pure
beautiful
waters
as
we
passed
the
extreme
western
point
of
the
island
my
husband
pointed
out
to
me
far
away
to
the
northwest
a
promontory
which
he
told
me
was
point
ignace
it
possessed
great
historic
interest
as
one
of
the
earliest
white
settlements
on
this
continent
the
jesuit
missionaries
had
established
here
a
church
and
school
as
early
as
the
same
year
in
which
a
white
settlement
was
made
at
augustine
in
florida
and
one
year
before
the
founding
of
jamestown
virginia
all
that
remains
of
the
enterprises
of
these
devoted
men
is
the
remembrance
of
their
labors
perpetuated
in
most
instances
only
by
the
names
of
the
spots
which
witnessed
their
efforts
of
love
in
behalf
of
their
savage
brethren
the
little
french
church
at
sandwich
opposite
detroit
alone
is
left
a
witness
of
the
zeal
and
of
these
pioneers
of
christianity
passing
old
mackinac
on
the
main
land
which
forms
the
southern
border
of
the
straits
we
soon
came
out
into
the
broad
waters
of
lake
michigan
every
traveller
and
every
reader
of
our
history
is
familiar
with
the
incidents
connected
with
the
taking
of
the
old
fort
by
the
indians
in
the
days
of
pontiac
how
by
means
of
a
game
of
ball
played
in
an
apparently
friendly
spirit
outside
the
walls
and
of
which
the
officers
and
soldiers
had
come
forth
to
be
spectators
the
ball
was
dexterously
tossed
over
the
wall
and
the
savages
rushing
in
under
pretext
of
finding
it
soon
got
possession
and
massacred
the
garrison
the
little
indian
village
of
croche
gleamed
far
away
south
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
with
that
exception
there
was
no
sign
of
living
habitation
along
that
vast
and
wooded
shore
the
gigantic
and
here
and
there
the
little
glades
of
prairie
opening
to
the
water
showed
a
landscape
that
would
have
gladdened
the
eye
of
the
agriculturist
with
its
promise
of
fertility
but
it
was
evidently
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
and
we
left
it
in
its
solitude
as
we
took
our
course
westward
across
the
waters
the
rainy
and
gusty
weather
so
incident
to
the
equinoctial
season
overtook
us
again
before
we
reached
the
mouth
of
green
bay
and
kept
us
company
until
the
night
of
our
arrival
upon
the
flats
about
three
miles
below
the
settlement
here
the
little
steamer
grounded
fast
and
hard
as
almost
every
one
preferred
braving
the
elements
to
remaining
cooped
up
in
the
quarters
we
had
occupied
for
the
past
week
we
decided
to
trust
ourselves
to
the
little
boat
spite
of
wind
and
rain
and
darkness
and
in
due
time
we
reached
the
shore
chapter
iii
green
bay
our
arrival
at
green
bay
was
at
an
unfortunate
moment
it
was
the
time
of
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
menomonees
and
waubanakees
consequently
not
only
the
commissioners
of
the
treaty
with
their
clerks
and
officials
but
traders
claimants
travellers
and
idlers
innumerable
were
upon
the
ground
most
of
these
were
congregated
in
the
only
hotel
the
place
afforded
this
was
a
house
near
the
and
as
we
entered
the
long
cold
and
dripping
from
the
open
boat
we
were
infinitely
amused
at
the
motley
assemblage
it
contained
various
groups
were
seated
around
new
comers
like
ourselves
stood
here
and
there
for
there
were
not
seats
enough
to
accommodate
all
who
sought
entertainment
the
landlord
sat
calm
and
indifferent
his
hands
in
his
pockets
exhibiting
all
the
phlegm
of
a
pennsylvania
dutchman
his
fat
notable
spouse
was
trotting
round
now
stopping
to
scold
about
some
one
who
burn
his
skin
had
fallen
short
in
his
duty
now
laughing
until
her
sides
shook
at
some
witticism
addressed
to
her
she
welcomed
us
very
cordially
but
to
our
inquiry
can
you
accommodate
us
her
reply
was
not
i
have
got
twice
as
many
people
now
as
i
know
what
to
do
with
i
have
had
to
turn
my
own
family
out
of
their
quarters
what
with
the
commissioners
and
the
lot
of
folks
that
has
come
in
upon
us
what
are
we
to
do
then
it
is
too
late
and
stormy
to
go
up
to
to
seek
for
lodgings
well
sit
you
down
and
take
your
supper
and
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
and
she
actually
did
contrive
to
find
a
little
nook
in
which
we
were
glad
to
take
refuge
from
the
multitudes
around
us
a
slight
board
partition
separated
us
from
the
apartment
occupied
by
general
root
of
new
york
one
of
the
commissioners
of
the
treaty
the
steamer
in
which
we
came
had
brought
the
mail
at
that
day
a
rare
blessing
to
the
distant
settlements
the
opening
and
reading
of
all
the
dispatches
which
the
general
received
about
had
of
course
to
be
gone
through
with
before
he
could
retire
to
rest
his
eyes
being
weak
his
secretaries
were
employed
to
read
the
communications
he
was
a
little
deaf
withal
and
through
the
slight
division
between
the
two
apartments
the
contents
of
the
letters
and
his
comments
upon
them
were
unpleasantly
audible
as
he
continually
admonished
his
secretary
to
raise
his
voice
what
is
that
walter
read
that
over
again
in
vain
we
coughed
and
hemmed
and
knocked
over
sundry
pieces
of
furniture
they
were
too
deeply
interested
to
hear
aught
that
passed
around
them
and
if
we
had
been
politicians
we
should
have
had
all
the
secrets
of
the
at
our
disposal
out
of
which
to
have
made
capital
the
next
morning
it
was
still
rain
rain
nothing
but
rain
in
spite
of
it
however
the
gentlemen
would
take
a
small
boat
to
row
to
the
steamer
to
bring
up
the
luggage
not
the
least
important
part
of
that
which
appertained
to
us
being
sundry
boxes
of
silver
for
paying
the
annuities
to
the
winnebagoes
at
the
portage
i
went
out
with
some
others
of
the
company
upon
the
piazza
to
witness
their
departure
a
gentleman
pointed
out
to
me
fort
howard
on
a
projecting
point
of
the
opposite
shore
about
of
a
mile
distant
the
old
barracks
the
picketed
inclosure
the
walls
all
looking
quaint
and
considering
their
modern
erection
really
ancient
and
venerable
presently
we
turned
our
attention
to
the
boat
which
had
by
this
time
gained
the
middle
of
the
river
one
of
the
passengers
was
standing
up
in
the
stern
apparently
giving
some
directions
that
is
rather
a
venturesome
fellow
remarked
one
if
he
is
not
careful
he
will
lose
his
balance
and
at
this
moment
we
saw
him
actually
perform
a
summerset
backward
and
disappear
in
the
water
oh
cried
i
he
will
be
drowned
the
gentlemen
laughed
no
there
he
is
they
are
helping
him
in
again
the
course
of
the
boat
was
immediately
changed
and
the
party
returned
to
the
shore
it
was
not
until
one
disembarked
and
came
dripping
and
laughing
towards
me
that
i
recognized
him
as
my
own
peculiar
property
he
was
pleased
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
joke
but
i
thought
it
rather
a
sad
beginning
of
western
experience
he
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
intrust
the
care
of
his
effects
to
his
friends
and
having
changed
his
dress
prepared
to
remain
quietly
with
me
when
just
at
this
moment
a
vehicle
drove
up
to
the
door
and
we
recognized
the
pleasant
familiar
face
of
our
old
friend
judge
doty
he
had
received
the
news
of
our
arrival
and
had
come
to
take
us
at
once
to
his
hospitable
mansion
we
were
only
too
happy
to
gather
together
our
bags
and
and
accompany
him
without
farther
ceremony
our
drive
took
us
first
along
the
edge
of
navarino
next
through
the
latter
a
far
more
appropriate
name
than
the
former
amid
mud
and
mire
over
bad
roads
and
up
and
down
hilly
places
until
we
reached
the
little
brick
dwelling
of
our
friends
doty
received
us
with
such
true
sisterly
kindness
and
everything
seemed
so
full
of
welcome
that
we
soon
felt
ourselves
at
home
we
found
that
expecting
our
arrival
invitations
had
already
been
prepared
to
assemble
the
whole
circle
of
green
bay
society
to
meet
us
at
an
evening
party
this
in
a
new
country
being
the
established
mode
of
doing
honor
to
guests
or
strangers
we
learned
upon
inquiry
that
captain
harney
who
had
kindly
offered
to
come
with
a
boat
and
crew
of
soldiers
from
fort
winnebago
to
convey
us
to
that
place
our
destined
home
had
not
yet
arrived
we
therefore
felt
at
liberty
to
make
arrangements
for
a
few
days
of
social
enjoyment
at
the
bay
it
was
pleasant
to
people
secluded
in
such
a
degree
from
the
world
at
large
to
bear
all
the
news
we
had
brought
all
the
particulars
of
life
and
manners
the
thousand
little
items
that
the
newspapers
of
that
day
did
not
dream
of
furnishing
the
fashions
and
that
general
gossip
in
short
which
a
lady
is
erroneously
supposed
more
of
than
a
gentleman
i
well
remember
that
in
giving
and
receiving
information
the
day
passed
in
a
pretty
uninterrupted
stream
of
communication
all
the
party
except
myself
had
made
the
journey
or
rather
voyage
up
the
fox
river
and
down
the
wisconsin
to
the
mississippi
there
were
plenty
of
anecdotes
of
a
certain
trip
performed
by
the
three
in
company
with
a
french
trader
and
his
two
sisters
then
making
their
debut
as
western
travellers
the
manner
in
which
mademoiselle
julie
would
borrow
without
leave
a
fine
damask
napkin
or
two
to
wipe
out
the
ducks
in
preparation
for
cooking
the
difficulty
of
persuading
either
of
the
sisters
of
the
propriety
of
washing
and
rinsing
their
table
apparatus
nicely
before
packing
it
away
in
the
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
another
nice
napkin
must
be
stealthily
whisked
out
to
wipe
the
dishes
when
the
hour
for
meals
arrived
the
fun
of
the
young
gentleman
in
hunting
up
his
stray
articles
thus
misappropriated
from
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
boat
tying
them
with
a
cord
and
hanging
them
over
the
stern
to
make
their
way
down
the
wisconsin
to
prairie
du
chien
then
there
was
a
capital
story
of
rolette
himself
at
one
point
on
the
route
i
think
in
crossing
winnebago
lake
the
travellers
met
one
of
the
company
boats
on
its
way
to
green
bay
for
supplies
rolette
was
one
of
the
agents
of
the
company
and
the
people
in
the
boat
were
his
employés
of
course
after
an
absence
of
some
weeks
from
home
the
meeting
on
these
lonely
waters
and
the
exchanging
of
news
was
an
occasion
of
great
excitement
the
boats
were
stopped
earnest
greetings
interchanged
question
followed
question
have
they
finished
the
new
house
la
cheminée
does
the
chimney
smoke
and
the
harvest
how
is
that
very
fine
indeed
is
the
mill
at
work
yes
plenty
of
water
how
is
whip
his
favorite
horse
oh
whip
is
everything
in
short
about
the
store
the
farm
the
business
of
various
descriptions
being
satisfactorily
gone
over
there
was
no
occasion
for
farther
delay
it
was
time
to
proceed
bien
adieu
bon
voyage
mes
gens
go
ahead
men
then
suddenly
arrêtez
stop
stop
se
portent
madame
rolette
et
les
enfans
how
are
rolette
and
the
children
this
day
with
its
excitement
was
at
length
over
and
we
retired
to
our
rest
thankful
that
we
had
not
general
root
and
his
secretary
close
to
our
bed
head
with
their
budget
of
political
news
my
slumbers
were
not
destined
however
to
be
quite
undisturbed
i
was
awakened
at
the
first
slight
peep
of
dawn
by
a
sound
from
an
apartment
beneath
our
own
a
plaintive
monotonous
chant
rising
and
then
falling
in
a
sort
of
mournful
cadence
it
seemed
to
me
a
wail
of
something
unearthly
so
wild
so
strange
so
unaccountable
in
terror
i
awoke
my
husband
who
reassured
me
by
telling
me
it
was
the
morning
salutation
of
the
indians
to
the
opening
day
some
menomonees
had
been
kindly
given
shelter
for
the
night
in
the
kitchen
below
and
having
fulfilled
their
unvarying
custom
of
chanting
their
morning
hymn
they
now
ceased
and
again
composed
themselves
to
sleep
but
not
so
their
auditor
there
was
to
me
something
inexpressibly
beautiful
in
this
morning
song
of
praise
from
the
untaught
sons
of
the
forest
what
a
lesson
did
it
preach
to
the
civilized
christianized
world
too
many
of
whom
lie
down
and
rise
up
without
an
aspiration
of
thanksgiving
to
their
almighty
preserver
without
even
a
remembrance
of
his
care
who
gives
his
angels
charge
concerning
them
never
has
the
impression
of
that
simple
act
of
worship
faded
from
my
mind
i
have
loved
to
think
that
with
some
these
strains
might
be
the
outpouring
of
a
devotion
as
pure
as
that
of
the
christian
when
he
utters
the
inspiring
words
of
the
sainted
ken
awake
my
soul
and
with
the
sun
etc
among
the
visitors
who
called
to
offer
me
a
welcome
to
the
west
were
and
miss
cadle
who
were
earnestly
engaged
in
the
first
steps
of
their
afterwards
flourishing
enterprise
for
the
education
of
indian
and
children
the
and
chapel
were
not
yet
erected
but
we
visited
their
proposed
site
and
listened
with
great
interest
to
bright
anticipations
of
the
future
good
that
was
to
be
accomplished
the
success
that
was
to
crown
their
efforts
for
taming
the
heathen
and
teaching
them
the
knowledge
of
their
saviour
and
the
blessings
of
civilized
life
the
sequel
has
shown
how
little
the
zeal
of
the
few
can
accomplish
when
opposed
to
the
cupidity
of
the
many
our
evening
party
went
off
as
parties
do
elsewhere
the
most
interesting
feature
to
me
because
the
most
novel
was
the
conversation
of
some
young
ladies
to
whom
i
was
introduced
natives
of
green
bay
or
its
vicinity
their
mother
was
a
menomonee
but
their
father
was
a
frenchman
a
descendant
of
a
settler
some
generations
back
and
who
there
is
reason
to
believe
was
a
branch
of
the
same
family
of
grignon
to
which
the
daughter
of
madame
de
sévigné
belonged
at
least
it
is
said
there
are
in
the
possession
of
the
family
many
old
papers
and
records
which
would
give
that
impression
although
the
orthography
of
the
name
has
become
slightly
changed
be
that
as
it
may
the
miss
grignons
were
strikingly
dignified
young
ladies
and
there
was
a
charm
about
their
soft
voices
and
original
unsophisticated
remarks
very
attractive
to
a
stranger
they
opened
to
me
however
a
new
field
of
apprehension
for
on
my
expressing
my
great
impatience
to
see
my
new
home
they
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
wonder
donc
pas
peur
des
snakes
was
it
possible
there
were
snakes
at
fort
winnebago
at
the
portage
oh
yes
one
can
never
walk
out
for
them
all
sorts
i
am
not
naturally
timid
but
i
must
confess
that
the
idea
of
the
and
the
was
not
quite
a
subject
of
indifference
there
was
one
among
these
young
ladies
whose
tall
graceful
figure
rich
blooming
complexion
and
dark
glancing
eye
would
have
distinguished
her
in
any
and
another
whose
gentle
sweetness
and
cultivated
taste
made
it
a
matter
of
universal
regret
that
she
was
afterwards
led
to
adopt
the
seclusion
of
a
convent
captain
harney
and
his
boat
arrived
in
due
time
and
active
preparations
far
the
comfort
of
our
journey
commenced
under
the
kind
supervision
of
doty
the
was
stowed
with
good
things
of
every
description
ham
and
tongue
biscuit
and
not
to
mention
the
substantiate
of
crackers
bread
and
boiled
pork
the
latter
of
which
however
a
lady
was
supposed
to
be
too
fastidious
to
think
of
touching
even
if
starving
in
the
woods
we
had
engaged
three
canadian
voyageurs
to
take
charge
of
our
tent
and
matters
and
things
in
general
their
business
it
was
to
be
to
cut
the
wood
for
our
fires
prepare
our
meals
and
give
a
helping
hand
to
whatever
was
going
forward
a
messenger
had
also
been
sent
to
the
kakalin
or
rapids
miles
above
to
notify
the
most
accomplished
guide
through
the
difficult
passes
of
the
river
to
be
in
readiness
for
our
service
on
a
specified
day
in
the
mean
time
we
had
leisure
for
one
more
party
and
it
was
to
be
a
real
western
hop
everybody
will
remember
that
dance
at
baird
all
the
people
young
and
old
that
would
be
gathered
throughout
or
as
it
was
the
fashion
to
express
it
green
bay
were
assembled
the
young
officers
were
up
from
fort
howard
looking
so
smart
in
their
uniforms
treasures
of
finery
long
uncalled
forth
were
now
brought
to
light
everybody
was
bound
to
do
honor
to
the
strangers
by
appearing
in
their
very
best
it
was
to
be
an
entertainment
unequalled
by
any
given
before
all
the
house
was
put
in
requisition
for
the
occasion
desks
and
seats
were
unceremoniously
dismissed
from
mr
b
office
which
formed
one
wing
to
afford
more
space
for
the
dancers
not
only
the
front
portion
of
the
dwelling
but
even
the
kitchen
was
made
fit
for
the
reception
of
company
in
case
any
primitive
visitor
as
was
sometimes
the
case
should
prefer
sitting
down
quietly
there
and
smoking
his
cigar
this
was
an
emergency
that
in
those
days
had
always
to
be
provided
for
nothing
could
exceed
the
mirth
and
hilarity
of
the
company
no
restraint
but
of
good
manners
no
excess
of
conventionalities
genuine
hearty
and
enjoyment
such
as
pleasant
hospitable
people
with
just
enough
of
the
french
element
to
add
zest
to
anything
like
amusement
could
furnish
to
make
the
entertainment
agreeable
in
a
country
so
new
and
where
in
a
social
gathering
the
number
of
the
company
was
more
important
than
the
quality
the
circle
was
not
always
strictly
speaking
select
i
was
aware
of
this
and
was
therefore
more
amused
than
surprised
when
a
clumsy
little
man
with
a
broad
red
laughing
face
waddled
across
the
room
to
where
i
had
taken
my
seat
after
a
dance
and
thus
addressed
me
k
nobody
hai
never
introduced
you
to
me
but
i
seen
you
a
good
many
times
and
i
know
your
husband
very
well
so
i
thought
i
might
just
as
well
come
and
speak
to
you
my
name
is
a
ah
a
i
hope
you
are
enjoying
yourself
how
is
your
sister
oh
she
is
a
great
deal
worse
her
cold
has
got
into
her
eye
and
it
is
all
then
turning
full
upon
a
lady
who
sat
near
radiant
with
youth
and
beauty
sparkling
with
wit
and
genuine
humor
oh
beall
he
began
what
a
beautiful
gown
you
have
got
on
and
how
handsome
you
do
look
i
declare
you
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
room
and
dance
the
handsomest
indeed
a
replied
she
suppressing
her
love
of
fun
and
assuming
a
demure
look
i
am
afraid
you
flatter
me
no
i
do
i
in
earnest
i
just
come
to
ask
you
to
dance
such
was
the
penalty
of
being
too
charming
chapter
iv
voyage
up
fox
river
it
had
been
arranged
that
judge
doty
should
accompany
us
in
our
boat
as
far
as
the
butte
des
morts
at
which
place
his
attendant
would
be
waiting
with
horses
to
convey
him
to
mineral
point
where
he
was
to
hold
court
it
was
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
when
we
left
his
pleasant
home
to
commence
our
passage
up
the
fox
river
captain
harney
was
proposing
to
remain
a
few
days
longer
at
the
bay
but
he
called
to
escort
us
to
the
boat
and
instal
us
in
all
its
comforts
as
he
helped
me
along
over
the
ploughed
ground
and
other
inequalities
in
our
way
to
the
where
the
boat
lay
he
told
me
how
impatiently
twiggs
the
wife
of
the
commanding
officer
who
since
the
past
spring
had
been
the
only
white
lady
at
fort
winnebago
was
now
expecting
a
companion
and
friend
we
had
met
in
new
york
shortly
after
her
marriage
and
were
therefore
not
quite
unacquainted
i
for
my
part
felt
sure
that
when
there
were
two
of
our
sex
when
my
piano
was
safely
there
when
the
post
library
which
we
had
purchased
should
be
unpacked
when
all
should
be
fairly
arranged
and
settled
we
should
be
although
far
away
in
the
wilderness
the
happiest
little
circle
imaginable
all
my
anticipations
were
of
the
most
sanguine
and
cheerful
character
it
was
a
mackinac
boat
with
a
crew
of
soldiers
and
our
own
three
voyageurs
in
addition
that
lay
waiting
for
us
a
structure
of
some
thirty
feet
in
length
placed
in
the
centre
was
a
of
slight
posts
supporting
a
roof
of
canvas
with
curtains
of
the
same
which
might
be
let
down
at
the
sides
and
ends
after
the
manner
of
a
country
or
rolled
up
to
admit
the
light
and
air
in
the
midst
of
this
little
cabin
or
saloon
was
placed
the
box
containing
my
piano
and
on
it
a
mattress
which
was
to
furnish
us
a
divan
through
the
day
and
a
place
of
repose
at
night
should
the
weather
at
any
time
prove
too
wet
or
unpleasant
for
encamping
the
boxes
of
silver
with
which
my
husband
was
to
pay
the
annuities
due
his
red
children
by
were
stowed
next
our
was
in
a
convenient
vicinity
and
we
had
purchased
a
couple
of
large
square
covered
baskets
of
the
waubanakees
or
new
york
indians
to
hold
our
various
necessary
articles
of
outward
apparel
and
bedding
and
at
the
same
time
to
answer
as
very
convenient
little
work
or
as
a
true
daughter
of
new
england
it
is
to
be
taken
for
granted
i
had
not
forgotten
to
supply
myself
with
and
embroidery
books
and
pencils
were
a
matter
of
course
the
greater
part
of
our
furniture
together
with
the
various
articles
for
housekeeping
with
which
we
had
supplied
ourselves
in
new
york
and
detroit
were
to
follow
in
another
boat
under
the
charge
of
people
whose
business
it
professed
to
be
to
take
cargoes
safely
up
the
rapids
and
on
to
fort
winnebago
this
was
an
enterprise
requiring
some
three
weeks
of
time
and
a
great
amount
of
labor
so
that
the
owners
of
the
goods
transported
might
think
themselves
happy
to
receive
them
at
last
however
wet
broken
and
dilapidated
their
condition
might
be
it
was
for
this
reason
that
we
took
our
choicest
possessions
with
us
even
at
the
risk
of
being
a
little
crowded
until
now
i
had
never
seen
a
gentleman
attired
in
a
colored
shirt
a
spotless
white
collar
and
bosom
being
one
of
those
notions
that
boston
and
consequently
new
england
folks
entertained
of
the
becoming
in
a
gentleman
toilette
cass
had
laughingly
forewarned
me
that
not
only
calico
shirts
but
were
an
indispensable
part
of
a
travelling
equipment
and
thanks
to
the
taste
and
skill
of
some
tidy
little
frenchwoman
i
found
our
all
accommodated
in
the
brightest
and
most
variegated
garb
the
judge
and
my
husband
were
gay
with
the
deepest
of
blue
and
pink
each
was
prepared
besides
with
a
bright
red
cap
a
or
as
the
voyageurs
call
it
which
out
of
respect
for
the
lady
was
to
be
donned
only
when
a
hearty
dinner
a
dull
book
or
the
want
of
exercise
made
an
afternoon
nap
indispensable
the
judge
was
an
admirable
travelling
companion
he
had
lived
many
years
in
the
country
had
been
with
general
cass
on
his
expedition
to
the
of
the
mississippi
and
had
a
vast
fund
of
anecdote
regarding
early
times
customs
and
inhabitants
some
instances
of
the
mode
of
administering
justice
in
those
days
i
happen
to
recall
there
was
an
old
frenchman
at
the
bay
named
réaume
excessively
ignorant
and
grasping
although
otherwise
tolerably
this
man
was
appointed
justice
of
the
peace
two
men
once
appeared
before
him
the
one
as
plaintiff
the
other
as
defendant
the
justice
listened
patiently
to
the
complaint
of
the
one
and
the
defence
of
the
other
then
rising
with
dignity
he
pronounced
his
decision
you
are
both
wrong
you
to
the
plaintiff
you
bring
me
one
load
of
hay
and
you
crély
to
the
defendant
you
bring
me
one
load
of
wood
and
now
the
matter
is
settled
it
does
not
appear
that
any
exceptions
were
taken
to
this
verdict
this
anecdote
led
to
another
the
scene
of
which
was
prairie
du
chien
on
the
mississippi
there
was
a
frenchman
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
was
universally
known
by
the
name
of
old
boilvin
his
office
was
just
without
the
walls
of
the
fort
and
it
was
much
the
fashion
among
the
officers
to
lounge
in
there
of
a
morning
to
find
sport
for
an
idle
hour
and
to
take
a
glass
of
with
the
old
gentleman
which
he
called
taking
a
little
a
soldier
named
fry
had
been
accused
of
stealing
and
killing
a
calf
belonging
to
rolette
and
the
constable
a
bricklayer
of
the
name
of
bell
had
been
dispatched
to
arrest
the
culprit
and
bring
him
to
trial
while
the
gentlemen
were
making
their
customary
morning
visit
to
the
justice
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
entry
and
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
cried
old
boilvin
rising
and
walking
toward
the
door
here
sir
i
have
brought
fry
to
you
as
you
ordered
fry
you
great
rascal
what
for
you
kill
rolette
calf
i
did
not
kill
rolette
calf
shaking
his
fist
you
lie
you
great
rascal
bell
take
him
to
jail
come
gentlemen
come
us
take
a
leetle
the
canadian
boatmen
always
sing
while
rowing
or
paddling
and
nothing
encourages
them
so
much
as
to
hear
the
bourgeois
take
the
lead
in
the
music
if
the
passengers
more
especially
those
of
the
fair
sex
join
in
the
refrain
the
compliment
is
all
the
greater
their
songs
are
of
a
light
cheerful
character
generally
embodying
some
little
satire
or
witticism
calculated
to
produce
a
spirited
sometimes
an
uproarious
chorus
the
song
and
refrain
are
carried
on
somewhat
in
the
following
style
chez
ma
tante
chez

and
thus
it
continues
until
the
advice
is
given
successively
ne
prenez
pas
une
noire
car
elles
aiment
trop
à
boire
ne
prenez
pas
une
rousse
car
elles
sont
trop
jalouses
and
by
the
time
all
the
different
qualifications
are
rehearsed
and
objected
to
lengthened
out
by
the
interminable
repetition
of
the
chorus
the
shout
of
the
bourgeois
is
heard
whoop
la
à
terre
à
terre
pour
la
pipe
it
is
an
invariable
custom
for
the
voyageurs
to
stop
every
five
or
six
miles
to
rest
and
smoke
so
that
it
was
formerly
the
way
of
measuring
distances
so
many
pipes
instead
of
so
many
miles
the
canadian
melodies
are
sometimes
very
beautiful
and
a
more
exhilarating
mode
of
travel
can
hardly
be
imagined
than
a
voyage
over
these
waters
amid
all
the
wild
magnificence
of
nature
with
the
measured
strokes
of
the
oar
keeping
time
to
the
strains
of
rosier
en
roulant
ma
or
ton
pied
ma
jolie
bergère
the
climax
of
fun
seemed
to
be
in
a
comic
piece
which
however
oft
repeated
appeared
never
to
grow
stale
it
was
somewhat
after
this
fashion
michaud
est
monté
dans
un
prunier
pour
treiller
des
prunes
la
branche
a
cassé
michaud
a
tombé
ou
est
il
est
en
bas
oh
reveille
reveille
reveille
oh
reveille
michaud
est
en
haut
it
was
always
a
point
of
etiquette
to
look
astonished
at
the
luck
of
michaud
in
remaining
in
the
tree
spite
of
the
breaking
of
the
branch
and
the
joke
had
to
be
repeated
through
all
the
varieties
of
that
michaud
might
be
supposed
able
to
climb
by
evening
of
the
first
day
we
arrived
at
where
another
branch
of
the
grignon
family
resided
we
were
very
pleasantly
entertained
although
in
my
anxiety
to
begin
my
forest
life
i
would
fain
have
had
the
tent
pitched
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
have
laid
aside
at
once
the
indulgences
of
civilization
this
however
would
have
been
a
slight
perhaps
an
affront
so
we
did
much
better
and
partook
of
the
good
cheer
that
was
offered
us
in
the
shape
of
hot
venison
steaks
and
crêpes
and
that
excellent
cup
of
coffee
which
none
can
prepare
like
a
frenchwoman
and
which
is
so
refreshing
after
a
day
in
the
open
air
the
kakalin
is
a
rapid
of
the
fox
river
sufficiently
important
to
make
the
portage
of
the
heavy
lading
of
a
boat
necessary
the
boat
itself
being
poled
or
dragged
up
with
cords
against
the
current
it
is
one
of
a
series
of
rapids
and
or
falls
which
occur
between
this
point
and
lake
winnebago
twenty
miles
above
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
took
leave
of
our
hosts
and
prepared
to
pursue
our
journey
the
bourgeois
from
an
early
hour
had
been
occupied
in
superintending
his
men
in
getting
the
boat
and
its
loading
over
the
kakalin
as
the
late
rains
had
made
the
paths
through
the
woods
and
along
the
banks
of
the
river
somewhat
muddy
and
uncomfortable
for
walking
i
was
put
into
an
to
be
jolted
over
the
unequal
road
saluting
impartially
all
the
stumps
and
stones
that
lay
in
our
way
the
only
means
of
avoiding
which
seemed
to
be
when
the
little
frenchman
our
conductor
bethought
him
of
suddenly
guiding
his
cattle
into
a
projecting
tree
or
to
the
great
detriment
not
only
of
my
straw
bonnet
but
of
my
very
eyes
but
we
got
through
at
last
and
arriving
at
the
head
of
the
rapids
i
found
the
boat
lying
there
all
in
readiness
for
our
our
menomonee
guide
a
fine
stalwart
indian
with
an
open
one
might
almost
say
countenance
came
forward
to
be
presented
to
me
was
his
laughing
salutation
again
i
was
surprised
not
as
before
at
the
french
for
to
that
i
had
become
accustomed
but
at
the
respectable
title
he
was
pleased
to
bestow
upon
me
yes
said
my
husband
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
receive
a
very
numerous
and
family
consisting
of
all
the
winnebagoes
pottowattamies
chippewas
and
ottawas
together
with
such
sioux
sacs
and
foxes
and
iowas
as
have
any
point
to
gain
in
applying
to
me
by
the
tribe
in
virtue
of
my
office
and
by
the
others
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
i
am
always
addressed
as
you
of
course
will
be
their
and
i
were
soon
good
friends
my
husband
interpreting
to
me
the
chippewa
language
in
which
he
spoke
we
were
impatient
to
be
off
the
morning
being
already
far
advanced
and
all
things
being
in
readiness
the
word
was
given
au
large
mes
gens
push
out
my
men
at
this
moment
a
boat
was
seen
leaving
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
making
towards
us
it
contained
white
men
and
they
showed
by
signs
that
they
wished
to
detain
us
until
they
came
up
they
drew
near
and
we
found
them
to
be
marsh
a
missionary
among
the
waubanakees
or
the
new
york
indians
lately
brought
into
this
country
and
the
rev
eleazar
williams
who
was
at
that
time
living
among
his
red
brethren
on
the
right
bank
of
the
fox
river
to
persons
so
situated
even
more
emphatically
than
to
those
of
the
settlements
the
arrival
of
visitors
from
the
east
countrie
was
a
godsend
indeed
we
had
to
give
all
the
news
of
various
kinds
that
we
had
brought
political
ecclesiastical
and
social
as
well
as
a
tolerably
detailed
account
of
what
we
proposed
to
do
or
rather
what
we
hoped
to
be
able
to
do
among
our
native
children
at
the
portage
i
was
obliged
for
my
part
to
confess
that
being
almost
entirely
a
stranger
to
the
indian
character
and
habits
i
was
going
among
them
with
no
settled
plans
of
any
kind
general
and
a
hope
of
making
them
my
friends
being
the
only
principles
i
could
lay
claim
to
at
present
i
must
leave
it
for
time
and
a
better
acquaintance
to
show
me
in
what
way
the
principle
could
be
carried
out
for
their
greatest
good
williams
was
a
man
having
always
heard
him
spoken
of
by
his
relations
in
connecticut
as
our
indian
cousin
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
his
belonging
to
that
race
although
i
now
think
that
if
i
had
met
him
elsewhere
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
spaniard
or
a
mexican
his
complexion
had
decidedly
more
of
the
olive
than
the
copper
hue
and
his
countenance
was
grave
almost
melancholy
he
was
very
silent
during
this
interview
asking
few
questions
and
offering
no
observations
except
in
reply
to
some
question
addressed
to
him
it
was
a
hard
pull
for
the
men
up
the
rapids
whose
clear
sonorous
voice
was
the
bugle
of
the
party
shouted
and
whooped
each
one
answered
with
a
chorus
and
a
still
more
vigorous
effort
the
boat
would
become
firmly
set
between
two
huge
stones
whoop
la
whoop
whoop
another
pull
and
another
straining
every
nerve
in
vain
she
will
not
budge
men
overboard
and
instantly
every
rower
is
over
the
side
and
into
the
water
by
pulling
pushing
and
tugging
the
boat
is
at
length
released
from
her
position
and
the
men
walk
along
beside
her
helping
and
guiding
her
until
they
reach
a
space
of
comparatively
smooth
water
when
they
again
take
their
seats
and
their
oars
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
there
were
few
songs
this
day
but
very
frequent
to
refresh
the
poor
fellows
after
such
an
arduous
service
it
was
altogether
a
new
spectacle
to
me
in
fact
i
had
hardly
ever
before
been
called
upon
to
witness
severe
bodily
exertion
and
my
sympathies
and
sensibilities
were
for
this
reason
the
more
enlisted
on
the
occasion
it
seemed
a
sufficient
hardship
to
have
to
labor
in
this
violent
manner
but
to
walk
in
cold
water
up
to
their
waists
and
then
to
sit
down
in
their
soaking
garments
without
going
near
a
fire
poor
men
this
was
too
much
to
be
borne
what
then
was
my
consternation
to
see
my
husband
who
shortly
after
our
meal
had
surprised
me
by
making
his
appearance
in
a
pair
of
duck
trowsers
and
light
jacket
at
the
first
cry
of
fast
again
spring
over
into
the
water
with
the
men
and
bear
a
hand
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
long
stretch
when
he
returned
on
board
it
was
to
take
the
oar
of
a
poor
boy
one
of
the
company
of
soldiers
who
from
the
first
had
suffered
with
bleeding
at
the
nose
on
every
unusual
exertion
i
was
not
surprised
on
inquiring
to
find
that
this
lad
was
a
recruit
just
entered
the
service
he
passed
by
the
name
of
gridley
but
that
was
undoubtedly
an
assumed
name
he
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
delicately
nurtured
and
had
probably
enlisted
without
at
all
appreciating
the
hardships
and
discomforts
of
a
soldier
life
this
is
evident
from
the
dissatisfaction
he
always
continued
to
feel
until
at
length
he
deserted
from
his
post
this
was
some
months
subsequent
to
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
he
was
once
retaken
and
kept
for
a
time
in
confinement
but
immediately
on
his
release
deserted
again
and
his
remains
were
found
the
following
spring
not
many
miles
from
the
fort
he
had
died
either
of
cold
or
starvation
this
is
a
sad
interlude
we
will
return
to
our
boating
with
all
our
tugging
and
toiling
we
had
accomplished
but
thirteen
miles
since
leaving
the
kakalin
and
it
was
already
late
when
we
arrived
in
view
of
the
grande
chûte
near
which
we
were
to
encamp
we
had
passed
the
little
chûte
the
spot
where
the
town
of
appleton
now
stands
without
any
further
observation
than
that
it
required
a
vast
deal
of
extra
exertion
to
buffet
with
the
rushing
stream
and
come
off
as
we
did
victorious
the
brilliant
light
of
the
setting
sun
was
resting
on
the
high
wooded
banks
through
which
broke
the
beautiful
foaming
dashing
waters
of
the
chûte
the
boat
was
speedily
turned
towards
a
little
headland
projecting
from
the
left
bank
which
had
the
advantage
of
a
long
strip
of
level
ground
sufficiently
spacious
to
afford
a
good
encamping
ground
i
jumped
ashore
before
the
boat
was
fairly
pulled
up
by
the
men
and
with
the
judge
help
made
my
way
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
a
point
lower
down
the
river
from
which
he
said
the
best
view
of
the
chûte
could
be
obtained
i
was
anxious
to
make
a
sketch
before
the
daylight
quite
faded
away
the
left
bank
of
the
river
was
to
the
west
and
over
a
portion
less
elevated
than
the
rest
the
sun
parting
rays
fell
upon
the
boat
the
men
with
their
red
caps
and
belts
and
the
two
tents
already
pitched
the
smoke
now
beginning
to
ascend
from
the
evening
fires
the
high
wooded
bank
beyond
up
which
the
steep
portage
path
could
just
be
discerned
and
more
remote
still
the
long
stretch
of
waterfall
now
darkening
in
the
shadow
of
the
overhanging
forests
formed
a
lovely
landscape
to
which
the
pencil
of
an
artist
could
alone
do
justice
this
was
my
first
encampment
and
i
was
quite
enchanted
with
the
novelty
of
everything
about
me
the
fires
had
been
made
of
small
saplings
and
underbrush
hastily
collected
the
mildness
of
the
weather
rendering
anything
beyond
what
sufficed
for
the
purposes
of
cooking
and
drying
the
men
clothes
superfluous
the
soldiers
tent
was
pitched
at
some
distance
from
our
own
but
not
too
far
for
us
to
hear
distinctly
their
laughter
and
apparent
enjoyment
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
under
the
careful
superintendence
of
corporal
kilgour
however
their
hilarity
never
passed
the
bounds
of
respectful
propriety
and
by
the
time
we
had
eaten
our
suppers
cooked
in
the
open
air
with
the
simple
apparatus
of
a
and
we
were
one
and
all
ready
to
retire
to
our
rest
the
first
sound
that
saluted
our
ears
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
following
morning
was
the
call
of
the
bourgeois
how
how
how
uttered
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
all
start
at
that
summons
and
the
men
are
soon
turning
out
of
their
tents
or
rousing
from
their
slumbers
beside
the
fire
and
preparing
for
the
duties
of
the
day
the
fire
is
replenished
the
kettles
set
on
to
boil
the
opened
and
a
portion
of
their
contents
brought
forth
to
be
made
ready
for
breakfast
one
frenchman
spreads
our
mat
within
the
tent
whence
the
bedding
has
all
been
carefully
removed
and
packed
up
for
stowing
in
the
boat
the
tin
cups
and
plates
are
placed
around
on
the
the
heavy
dews
make
it
a
little
too
damp
for
us
to
breakfast
in
the
open
air
otherwise
our
preparations
would
be
made
outside
upon
the
green
grass
in
an
incredibly
short
time
our
smoking
coffee
and
broiled
ham
are
placed
before
us
to
which
are
added
from
time
to
time
slices
of
toast
brought
hot
and
fresh
from
the
glowing
coals
there
is
after
all
no
breakfast
like
a
breakfast
in
the
woods
with
a
frenchman
for
master
of
ceremonies
it
was
a
hard
day
work
to
which
the
men
now
applied
themselves
that
of
dragging
the
heavy
boat
up
the
chûte
it
had
been
thought
safest
to
leave
the
piano
in
its
place
on
board
but
the
rest
of
the
lading
had
to
be
carried
up
the
steep
bank
and
along
its
summit
a
distance
of
some
hundreds
of
rods
to
the
smooth
water
beyond
where
all
the
difficulties
of
our
navigation
terminated
the
judge
kindly
took
charge
of
me
while
the
bourgeois
superintended
this
important
business
and
with
reading
sketching
and
strolling
about
the
morning
glided
away
twelve
came
and
still
the
preparations
for
starting
were
not
yet
completed
in
my
rambles
about
to
seek
out
some
of
the
finest
of
the
wild
flowers
for
a
bouquet
before
my
husband
return
i
came
upon
the
of
the
soldiers
a
tall
young
man
in
fatigue
dress
was
attending
a
kettle
of
soup
the
savory
steams
of
which
were
very
attractive
seeing
that
i
was
observing
his
occupation
he
politely
ladled
out
a
of
the
liquid
and
offered
it
to
me
i
declined
it
saying
we
should
have
our
dinner
immediately
they
left
me
here
to
get
their
dinner
said
he
apparently
not
displeased
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
make
some
soup
down
on
the
german
flats
where
i
come
from
they
always
like
soup
ah
you
are
from
the
german
flats
then
your
name
must
be
bellinger
or
weber
no
it
is
it
krissman
well
krissman
how
do
you
like
the
service
very
well
i
was
only
recruited
last
summer
i
used
to
ride
horse
on
the
and
as
i
can
blow
a
horn
i
expect
i
will
soon
be
able
to
play
on
a
bugle
and
then
when
i
get
to
be
musician
you
know
i
shall
have
extra
pay
i
did
not
know
it
but
i
expressed
due
pleasure
at
the
information
and
wishing
krissman
all
manner
of
success
in
his
dreams
of
ambition
or
rather
i
should
say
of
avarice
for
the
hopes
of
extra
pay
evidently
preponderated
over
those
of
fame
i
returned
to
my
own
quarters
my
husband
with
his
french
tastes
was
inclined
to
be
somewhat
disappointed
when
i
told
him
of
this
little
incident
and
my
refusal
of
krissman
soup
but
we
were
soon
gratified
by
seeing
his
tall
awkward
form
bearing
a
kettle
of
the
composition
which
he
set
down
before
the
two
gentlemen
by
whom
to
his
infinite
satisfaction
it
was
pronounced
excellent
everything
being
at
length
in
readiness
the
tents
were
struck
and
carried
around
the
portage
and
my
husband
the
judge
and
i
followed
at
our
leisure
the
woods
were
brilliant
with
wild
flowers
although
it
was
so
late
in
the
season
that
the
glory
of
the
summer
was
past
but
the
lupin
the
and
the
yellow
wallflower
with
all
the
varieties
of
the
helianthus
the
aster
and
the
solidago
spread
their
gay
charms
around
the
gentlemen
gathered
clusters
of
the
bittersweet
celastrus
scandens
from
the
overhanging
boughs
to
make
a
wreath
for
my
hat
as
we
trod
the
tangled
pathway
which
like
that
of
christabel
was
now
in
glimmer
and
now
in
gloom
through
the
alternations
of
open
glade
and
shady
thicket
soon
like
the
same
lovely
heroine
we
reached
the
place
right
glad
we
were
and
without
further
delay
we
were
again
on
board
our
little
boat
and
skimming
over
the
now
placid
waters
chapter
winnebago
lake
miss
our
encampment
this
night
was
the
most
charming
that
can
be
imagined
owing
to
the
heavy
service
the
men
had
gone
through
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
we
took
but
a
short
stage
for
the
afternoon
and
having
pulled
some
seven
or
eight
miles
to
a
spot
a
short
distance
below
the
little
butte
we
drew
in
at
a
beautiful
opening
among
the
trees
the
soldiers
now
made
a
regular
business
of
encamping
by
cutting
down
a
large
tree
for
their
fire
and
applying
themselves
to
the
preparing
of
a
sufficient
quantity
of
food
for
their
next
day
journey
a
long
stretch
namely
of
miles
across
winnebago
lake
our
frenchmen
did
the
same
the
fire
caught
in
the
light
dry
grass
by
which
we
were
surrounded
and
soon
all
was
blaze
and
crackle
fortunately
the
wind
was
sufficient
to
take
the
flames
all
in
one
direction
and
besides
there
was
not
enough
fuel
to
have
made
them
a
subject
of
any
alarm
we
hopped
upon
the
fallen
logs
and
dignified
the
little
circumscribed
affair
with
the
name
of
a
prairie
on
fire
the
most
serious
inconvenience
was
its
having
consumed
all
the
dry
grass
some
armfuls
of
which
spread
under
the
in
my
tent
i
had
found
the
night
before
a
great
improvement
to
my
place
of
repose
our
supper
was
truly
delightful
at
the
pleasant
sunset
hour
under
the
tall
trees
beside
the
waters
that
ran
murmuring
by
and
when
the
bright
broad
moon
arose
and
shed
her
flood
of
light
over
the
scene
so
wild
yet
so
beautiful
in
its
vast
solitude
i
felt
that
i
might
well
be
an
object
of
envy
to
the
friends
i
had
left
behind
but
all
things
have
an
end
and
so
must
at
last
my
enthusiasm
for
the
beauties
around
me
and
albeit
unwillingly
i
closed
my
tent
and
took
my
place
within
so
near
the
fall
of
canvas
that
i
could
raise
it
occasionally
and
peep
forth
upon
the
night
in
time
all
was
quiet
the
men
had
become
silent
and
appeared
to
have
retired
to
rest
and
we
were
just
sinking
to
our
slumbers
when
a
heavy
tread
and
presently
a
bluff
voice
were
heard
outside
kinzie
mr
kinzie
who
is
there
what
is
it
i
krissman
did
you
mean
sir
that
the
men
should
have
any
liquor
of
course
i
did
has
not
kilgour
given
out
your
rations
no
he
says
you
did
not
say
anything
particular
about
it
and
he
was
not
coming
to
ask
you
if
you
forgot
it
but
i
thought
i
would
be
bashful
i
just
come
and
ask
that
is
right
tell
kilgour
i
should
like
to
have
him
serve
out
a
ration
apiece
thank
you
sir
in
a
most
cheerful
tone
i
tell
him
krissman
was
getting
to
be
quite
a
character
with
us
a
row
of
a
few
miles
on
the
following
morning
brought
us
to
village
at
the
entrance
to
winnebago
lake
a
picturesque
cluster
of
indian
huts
spread
around
on
a
pretty
green
glade
and
shaded
by
fine
lofty
trees
we
were
now
fairly
in
the
winnebago
country
and
i
soon
learned
that
the
name
of
the
place
was
derived
from
the
principal
chief
of
the
nation
whose
residence
it
was
the
inhabitants
were
absent
having
in
all
probability
departed
to
their
wintering
grounds
we
here
took
leave
of
our
friend
at
the
borders
of
whose
country
we
had
now
arrived
chon
john
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
completed
his
adieu
as
we
pushed
off
into
the
lake
and
left
him
smoking
his
and
waiting
until
the
spirit
should
move
him
to
take
up
his
long
towards
his
home
in
the
menomonee
country
with
him
our
sunshine
seemed
to
have
departed
the
skies
hitherto
so
bright
and
serene
became
overcast
and
instead
of
the
charming
voyage
we
had
anticipated
over
the
silver
waters
of
the
lake
we
were
obliged
to
keep
ourselves
housed
under
our
canvas
shelter
only
peeping
out
now
and
then
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
surrounding
prospect
through
the
pouring
rain
it
was
what
might
have
been
expected
on
an
autumnal
day
but
we
were
unreasonable
enough
to
find
it
tedious
so
to
beguile
the
time
and
lessen
my
disappointment
my
husband
related
to
me
some
incidents
of
his
early
history
apropos
to
the
subject
of
while
he
was
living
at
prairie
du
chien
in
the
employ
of
the
american
fur
company
the
chiefs
and
other
indians
from
the
upper
mississippi
used
frequently
to
come
to
the
place
to
sell
their
furs
and
peltries
and
to
purchase
merchandise
ammunition
trinkets
etc
as
is
usual
with
all
who
are
not
yet
acclimated
he
was
seized
with
chills
and
fever
one
day
while
suffering
with
an
unusually
severe
access
of
the
latter
a
chief
of
the
family
a
brother
to
the
one
before
mentioned
came
in
to
the
company
warehouse
to
trade
there
is
no
ceremony
or
restraint
among
the
indians
so
hearing
that
was
sick
instantly
made
his
way
to
him
to
offer
his
sympathy
and
prescribe
the
proper
remedies
every
one
who
has
suffered
from
ague
and
the
intense
fever
that
succeeds
it
knows
how
insupportable
is
the
protracted
conversation
of
an
inconsiderate
person
and
will
readily
believe
that
the
longer
continued
his
pratings
the
higher
mounted
the
fever
of
the
patient
and
the
more
intolerable
became
the
pain
of
head
back
and
limbs
at
length
the
old
man
arrived
at
the
climax
of
what
he
had
to
say
it
was
not
good
for
a
young
man
suffering
with
sickness
and
away
from
his
family
to
be
without
a
home
and
a
wife
he
had
a
nice
daughter
at
home
handsome
and
healthy
a
capital
nurse
the
best
hand
in
all
the
tribe
at
trapping
beaver
and
he
was
coming
down
again
in
the
spring
and
he
would
bring
her
with
him
and
should
see
that
he
had
told
no
falsehood
about
her
should
he
go
now
and
bring
his
daughter
the
next
time
he
came
stunned
with
his
importunate
babble
and
anxious
only
for
rest
and
quiet
poor
eagerly
assented
and
the
chief
took
his
departure
so
nearly
had
his
disorder
been
aggravated
to
delirium
that
the
young
man
forgot
entirely
for
a
time
the
interview
and
the
proposal
which
had
been
made
him
but
it
was
recalled
to
his
memory
some
months
after
when
made
his
appearance
bringing
with
him
a
squaw
of
mature
age
and
a
very
hecate
for
ugliness
she
carried
on
her
shoulders
an
immense
pack
of
furs
which
approaching
with
her
awkward
gait
she
threw
at
his
feet
thus
marking
by
an
indian
custom
her
sense
of
the
relation
that
existed
between
them
the
conversation
with
her
father
now
flashed
across
his
mind
and
he
began
to
be
sensible
that
he
had
got
into
a
position
that
it
would
require
some
skill
to
extricate
himself
from
he
bade
one
of
the
young
clerks
take
up
the
pack
and
carry
it
into
the
magazine
where
the
furs
were
stored
then
he
coolly
went
on
talking
with
the
chief
about
indifferent
matters
sat
awhile
with
a
sulky
discontented
air
at
length
she
broke
out
humph
he
seems
to
take
no
more
notice
of
me
than
if
i
was
nobody
he
again
turned
to
the
give
her
a
calico
shirt
and
half
a
dozen
this
did
not
dissipate
the
gloom
on
her
countenance
finding
that
he
must
commence
the
subject
the
father
says
well
i
have
brought
you
my
daughter
according
to
our
agreement
how
do
you
like
her
ah
yes
she
is
a
very
nice
young
woman
and
would
make
a
wife
i
have
no
doubt
but
do
you
know
a
very
strange
thing
has
happened
since
you
were
here
our
father
governor
cass
has
sent
for
me
to
come
to
detroit
that
he
may
send
me
among
the
wyandottes
and
other
nations
to
learn
their
customs
and
manners
now
if
i
go
as
i
shall
be
obliged
to
do
i
shall
be
absent
two
or
three
years
perhaps
four
what
then
why
the
people
will
say
has
married
daughter
and
then
has
hated
her
and
run
away
from
her
and
so
everybody
will
laugh
at
her
and
she
will
be
ashamed
it
will
be
better
to
take
some
good
valuable
presents
blankets
guns
and
to
marry
her
to
one
of
her
own
people
who
will
always
stay
by
her
and
take
care
of
her
the
old
man
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
it
was
wisest
to
make
the
best
bargain
he
could
i
have
no
doubt
it
cost
a
round
sum
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
injured
damsel
though
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
how
much
this
i
know
that
the
young
gentleman
took
care
not
to
make
his
next
bargain
while
in
a
fit
of
the
ague
the
lady
up
on
the
mississippi
is
called
in
derision
by
his
name
to
this
day
about
midway
of
the
lake
we
passed
garlic
island
a
lovely
spot
deserving
of
a
more
attractive
name
it
belonged
together
with
the
village
on
the
opposite
shore
to
wild
cat
a
fat
jolly
fellow
by
no
means
the
formidable
animal
his
name
would
imply
he
and
his
band
were
absent
like
their
neighbors
of
village
so
there
was
nothing
to
vary
the
monotony
of
our
sail
it
was
too
wet
to
sing
and
the
men
although
wrapped
in
their
overcoats
looked
like
drowned
chickens
they
were
obliged
to
ply
their
oars
with
unusual
vigor
to
keep
themselves
warm
and
comfortable
and
thus
probably
felt
less
than
we
the
dulness
and
listlessness
of
the
cold
rainy
october
day
towards
evening
the
sun
shone
forth
we
had
passed
into
the
fox
river
and
were
just
entering
that
beautiful
little
expanse
known
as
butte
des
morts
lake
at
the
farther
extremity
of
which
we
were
to
encamp
for
the
night
the
water
along
its
shores
was
green
with
the
fields
of
wild
rice
the
gathering
of
which
just
at
this
season
is
an
important
occupation
of
the
indian
women
they
push
their
canoes
into
the
thick
masses
of
the
rice
bend
it
forward
over
the
side
with
their
paddles
and
then
beat
the
ripe
husks
off
the
stalks
into
a
cloth
spread
in
the
canoe
after
this
it
is
rubbed
to
separate
the
grain
from
the
husk
and
fanned
in
the
open
air
it
is
then
put
in
their
cordage
bags
and
packed
away
for
winter
use
the
grain
is
longer
and
more
slender
than
the
carolina
rice
it
is
of
a
color
and
although
it
forms
a
pleasant
article
of
food
it
is
far
from
being
particularly
nutritive
the
indians
are
fond
of
it
in
the
form
of
soup
with
the
addition
of
birds
or
venison
chapter
vi
breakfast
at
betty
more
the
earth
the
trees
and
the
shrubbery
were
all
too
much
filled
with
the
heavy
rain
which
had
fallen
to
allow
us
to
think
of
encamping
so
we
made
arrangements
to
bestow
ourselves
in
our
little
saloon
for
the
night
it
was
rather
a
difficult
matter
to
light
a
fire
but
among
the
underbrush
in
a
wild
undisturbed
spot
there
will
always
be
found
some
fragments
of
dried
branches
and
tufts
of
grass
which
the
rain
has
not
reached
and
by
the
assistance
of
the
spunk
or
with
which
travellers
always
go
well
provided
a
comforting
fire
was
at
length
blazing
brightly
after
our
chilling
tedious
day
it
was
pleasant
to
gather
round
it
to
sit
on
the
end
of
the
blazing
logs
and
watch
the
frenchmen
preparing
our
supper
the
kettle
nestling
in
a
little
nook
of
bright
glowing
coals
the
slices
of
ham
browning
and
crisping
on
the
forked
sticks
or
broches
which
the
voyageurs
dexterously
cut
and
set
around
the
burning
brands
the
savory
messes
of
pork
and
onions
hissing
in
the
always
a
tempting
regale
to
the
hungry
frenchmen
truly
it
needs
a
wet
chilly
journey
taken
nearly
fasting
as
ours
had
been
to
enable
one
to
enjoy
to
its
full
extent
that
social
meal
a
supper
the
bright
sun
setting
amid
brilliant
masses
of
clouds
such
as
are
seen
only
in
our
western
skies
gave
promise
of
a
fine
day
on
the
morrow
with
which
comforting
assurance
we
were
glad
to
take
our
leave
of
him
and
soon
after
of
each
other
we
had
hardly
roused
up
the
following
morning
in
obedience
to
the
call
of
the
bourgeois
when
our
eyes
were
greeted
with
the
sight
of
an
addition
to
our
company
a
tall
stalwart
young
or
accompanied
by
two
or
three
indians
vociferous
and
joyous
were
the
salutations
of
the
latter
to
their
father
and
their
new
mother
they
were
the
first
winnebagoes
i
had
seen
and
they
were
decidedly
not
the
finest
specimens
of
their
tribe
the
mitiff
a
scion
of
the
tree
of
the
grignons
was
the
bearer
of
an
invitation
to
us
from
judge
law
who
with
one
or
two
green
bay
friends
was
encamped
a
few
miles
above
to
come
and
breakfast
with
him
in
his
tent
we
had
not
dreamed
of
finding
white
neighbors
here
but
our
vicinity
could
be
no
secret
to
them
as
long
as
there
was
an
indian
in
the
neighborhood
so
delaying
only
for
the
soldiers
to
finish
their
breakfast
we
pushed
on
for
the
butte
des
morts
or
as
a
always
persisted
in
calling
it
the
white
tent
of
the
judge
gleamed
in
the
morning
sun
as
we
approached
the
little
rising
ground
on
which
it
stood
the
river
was
filled
with
canoes
paddled
principally
by
squaws
many
indians
were
to
be
seen
on
the
banks
all
with
their
guns
and
hunting
accoutrements
for
the
air
was
filled
in
every
direction
with
flocks
of
teal
which
at
this
season
are
most
abundant
and
delicious
the
immense
fields
of
wild
rice
abounding
here
and
in
the
little
lake
below
make
this
vicinity
their
favorite
place
of
resort
in
the
autumn
months
the
effect
of
this
nourishing
food
is
to
make
the
flesh
of
the
birds
so
fat
so
white
and
so
tender
that
a
caution
is
always
given
to
a
young
sportsman
to
fire
only
at
such
as
fly
very
low
for
if
shot
high
in
the
air
they
are
bruised
to
pieces
and
rendered
unfit
for
eating
by
their
fall
to
the
ground
we
were
hemmed
in
by
a
little
fleet
of
canoes
which
surrounded
us
the
women
chattering
laughing
and
eagerly
putting
forward
their
little
wooden
bowls
of
fresh
cranberries
as
an
offering
of
welcome
to
me
i
amused
myself
with
tossing
crackers
to
them
some
of
which
would
reach
them
others
would
fall
into
the
water
and
then
such
a
scrambling
and
shouting
hands
and
paddles
were
in
requisition
and
loud
was
the
triumph
of
her
who
was
successful
in
reaching
a
floating
one
among
the
indians
with
whom
was
now
engaged
in
shaking
hands
and
who
all
seemed
old
friends
were
many
fine
straight
figures
all
of
them
exhibiting
frames
capable
of
enduring
fatigue
and
the
hardships
of
their
mode
of
life
one
was
describing
with
much
gesticulation
the
abundance
of
the
game
in
the
neighborhood
and
he
seemed
greatly
delighted
at
receiving
a
quantity
of
ammunition
with
which
he
instantly
departed
to
make
good
his
boasts
in
the
matter
after
walking
a
short
distance
we
reached
the
tent
where
i
was
introduced
to
judge
law
and
a
pleasant
little
french
gentleman
of
the
name
of
porlier
several
voyageurs
and
were
near
the
former
busily
at
work
the
latter
lounging
for
the
most
part
and
going
through
with
what
they
had
to
do
with
a
sort
of
listless
indifference
the
contrast
between
the
air
of
the
one
class
and
the
apathetic
manner
of
the
other
was
quite
striking
after
a
short
conversation
among
the
members
of
the
party
breakfast
was
announced
and
we
entered
the
tent
and
took
our
seats
on
the
ground
around
the
indian
mat
which
supplied
the
place
of
a
table
the
post
of
honor
namely
the
of
the
table
was
of
course
given
to
me
so
that
i
could
not
only
look
around
upon
the
circle
of
the
company
but
also
enjoy
a
fine
view
out
of
the
open
door
of
the
tent
and
take
an
observation
of
all
that
was
going
on
at
the
outside
judge
doty
sat
opposite
me
with
his
back
to
the
opening
of
the
tent
and
the
other
gentlemen
on
either
hand
we
had
for
our
waiter
the
tall
mitiff
who
had
been
the
messenger
of
the
morning
he
was
still
in
the
same
garb
calico
shirt
scarf
around
his
waist
and
on
his
head
a
straw
hat
encircled
with
a
band
of
black
ostrich
feathers
the
usual
dress
of
his
class
the
tin
cups
which
were
to
hold
our
coffee
were
duly
set
around
then
of
the
same
metal
with
knives
and
forks
then
followed
the
viands
among
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
was
a
large
tin
pan
of
boiled
ducks
the
judge
wishing
to
show
probably
that
although
we
were
in
the
vast
wilderness
all
fastidious
nicety
had
not
been
left
behind
took
up
the
plate
which
had
been
set
before
him
and
seeing
something
adhering
to
it
which
did
not
exactly
please
him
handed
it
over
his
shoulder
to
grignon
requesting
him
to
wipe
it
carefully
grignon
complied
by
pulling
a
black
silk
barcelona
handkerchief
out
of
his
bosom
where
it
had
been
snugly
tucked
away
to
answer
any
occasion
that
might
present
itself
and
giving
the
tin
a
furious
polishing
handed
it
back
again
the
judge
looked
at
it
with
a
smile
of
approbation
and
giving
a
glance
around
the
table
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
how
i
choose
to
have
things
done
applied
himself
to
his
breakfast
the
trail
for
fort
winnebago
then
led
from
the
shore
opposite
butte
des
morts
through
swamp
and
past
green
lake
and
it
was
well
for
the
judge
that
his
horses
stood
waiting
for
him
to
mount
and
away
as
early
as
possible
after
breakfast
or
i
am
afraid
the
story
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
tell
would
have
made
his
ride
an
uncomfortable
one
throughout
the
day
we
had
hardly
finished
breakfast
when
our
hunter
who
had
received
the
ammunition
returned
bringing
with
him
about
fifty
fine
ducks
which
he
had
shot
in
little
more
than
an
hour
from
that
time
until
the
close
of
our
journey
our
supply
of
these
delicate
birds
was
never
wanting
chapter
vii
butte
des
morts
lake
puckaway
the
butte
des
morts
or
hillock
of
the
dead
was
the
scene
long
since
of
a
most
sanguinary
battle
between
the
french
and
the
or
foxes
so
great
was
the
carnage
in
this
engagement
that
the
memory
of
it
has
been
perpetuated
by
the
gloomy
appellation
given
to
the
mound
where
the
dead
were
buried
the
foxes
up
to
this
time
had
inhabited
the
shores
of
the
river
to
which
they
had
given
their
name
but
being
completely
overwhelmed
and
beaten
in
this
conflict
they
retired
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
mississippi
and
sought
an
asylum
among
their
allies
the
saukies
or
as
they
are
now
called
the
sauks
with
whom
they
became
gradually
incorporated
until
the
combined
tribes
came
to
be
known
as
at
present
by
the
name
of
sauks
and
foxes
among
the
french
inhabitants
of
the
upper
country
each
tribe
of
indians
has
a
particular
appellation
descriptive
of
some
peculiarity
of
either
their
habits
or
their
personal
appearance
thus
the
chippewas
from
their
agility
are
denominated
sauteurs
or
jumpers
the
ottawas
the
or
the
menomonees
from
the
wild
rice
so
abundant
in
their
country
are
called
folles
avoines
the
winnebagoes
from
their
custom
of
wearing
the
fur
of
a
polecat
on
their
legs
when
equipped
for
war
are
termed
les
puans
the
pottowattamies
from
their
uncleanly
habits
les
poux
the
foxes
are
les
renards
etc
etc
hence
you
will
never
hear
a
french
or
resident
of
the
country
mention
an
indian
in
any
other
style
such
a
person
is
a
is
that
woman
a
no
she
is
a
avoine
in
this
manner
a
stranger
is
somewhat
puzzled
at
first
to
classify
the
acquaintances
he
forms
all
the
native
friends
with
whom
we
were
here
surrounded
were
les
puans
or
to
use
their
own
euphonious
appellation
the
having
with
great
regret
said
adieu
to
our
friend
judge
doty
whose
society
had
contributed
so
much
to
the
pleasure
of
our
trip
and
whose
example
moreover
had
given
us
a
valuable
lesson
to
take
things
as
we
find
them
we
bade
at
an
early
hour
after
breakfast
to
our
kind
hosts
and
set
forward
on
our
journey
from
butte
des
morts
to
the
portage
the
distance
by
land
is
about
seventy
miles
by
water
it
is
not
less
than
a
hundred
and
thirty
so
serpentine
is
the
course
of
the
river
through
the
low
swampy
prairies
which
stretch
over
a
great
portion
of
this
part
of
the
country
about
six
miles
above
the
butte
a
tolerably
broad
stream
called
wolf
river
joins
the
fox
and
as
it
is
much
the
more
direct
and
promising
of
the
two
strangers
have
sometimes
mistaken
it
for
the
main
stream
and
journeyed
up
it
a
considerable
distance
before
discovering
to
their
great
chagrin
that
they
must
retrace
their
steps
beyond
this
place
the
river
begins
to
play
its
pranks
with
the
compass
as
i
was
always
looking
out
for
pretty
scenery
to
sketch
i
was
at
one
spot
much
attracted
by
a
picturesque
group
on
a
bank
quite
close
to
the
stream
there
were
broad
overhanging
trees
and
two
or
three
wigwams
nestled
under
their
shade
little
children
quite
unencumbered
with
clothing
were
sporting
about
and
their
two
mothers
were
sitting
on
the
ground
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
mat
for
their
lodge
it
was
a
pretty
scene
and
i
commenced
a
sketch
as
usual
the
whole
party
on
the
bank
set
up
a
shout
when
they
recognized
it
was
an
occasion
on
which
they
became
demonstrative
after
a
little
time
we
proceeded
and
i
went
on
to
complete
my
drawing
the
sun
kept
coming
more
and
more
into
the
wrong
place
he
had
been
just
behind
me
presently
he
was
on
my
left
hand
now
he
was
straight
ahead
i
moved
from
time
to
time
at
length
the
sun
was
decidedly
on
my
right
hand
what
could
be
the
matter
i
looked
up
oh
here
is
a
pretty
scene
i
must
have
this
too
but
how
surprisingly
like
the
one
i
have
just
finished
only
in
a
different
direction
again
we
were
greeted
with
shouts
and
laughter
it
was
the
same
spot
which
we
had
passed
not
an
hour
before
and
having
taken
a
circuit
of
nearly
four
miles
we
had
returned
to
find
that
we
had
made
an
actual
progress
of
only
the
width
of
the
bank
on
which
the
trees
and
wigwams
stood
decidedly
not
very
encouraging
to
an
impatient
traveller
we
reached
lake
puckaway
late
in
the
evening
of
our
second
day
from
butte
des
morts
here
lived
a
white
man
named
gleason
the
same
concerning
whom
owing
to
his
vast
powers
of
exaggeration
poor
hooe
was
fond
of
uttering
his
little
pun
all
is
not
gold
that
gleasons
we
did
not
seek
shelter
at
his
house
for
late
as
the
season
was
we
found
the
shore
so
infested
with
mosquitoes
that
we
were
glad
to
choose
a
spot
as
far
as
possible
from
the
bank
and
make
ourselves
comfortable
in
our
boat
this
lake
has
its
name
from
the
long
flags
or
rushes
which
are
found
in
its
waters
in
great
abundance
and
of
which
the
squaws
manufacture
the
coarse
matting
used
in
covering
their
wigwams
their
mode
of
fabricating
this
is
very
primitive
and
simple
seated
on
the
ground
with
the
rushes
laid
side
by
side
and
fastened
at
each
extremity
they
pass
their
shuttle
a
long
flat
needle
made
of
bone
to
which
is
attached
a
piece
of
cordage
formed
of
the
bark
of
a
tree
through
each
rush
thus
confining
it
very
closely
and
making
a
fine
substantial
mat
these
mats
are
seldom
more
than
five
or
six
feet
in
length
as
a
greater
size
would
be
inconvenient
in
adjusting
and
preparing
the
lodges
it
is
a
species
of
labor
usually
assigned
to
the
elder
women
of
the
family
when
they
become
broken
down
and
worn
out
with
exposure
and
hardship
so
that
they
can
not
cut
down
trees
hoe
corn
or
carry
heavy
burdens
they
are
set
to
weaving
mats
taking
care
of
the
children
and
disciplining
the
dogs
with
which
every
indian
lodge
abounds
lac
de
boeuf
or
buffalo
lake
into
which
our
course
next
brought
us
is
a
lovely
sheet
of
water
in
some
places
its
banks
are
exceedingly
picturesque
with
beautiful
headlands
jutting
out
into
the
clear
depths
where
they
and
the
magnificent
groups
of
trees
which
crown
them
lie
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
now
and
then
we
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
deer
darting
across
the
glades
which
at
intervals
opened
through
the
woodlands
or
a
pair
of
cranes
would
rise
slowly
flapping
their
wings
and
seek
a
place
of
more
undisturbed
repose
the
flocks
of
teal
now
skimming
the
surface
of
the
water
now
rising
higher
towards
the
shelter
of
the
forests
tempted
our
sportsman
sorely
but
as
there
was
little
prospect
of
finding
his
game
when
it
was
brought
down
he
did
not
give
way
to
the
wanton
pleasure
of
shooting
merely
to
destroy
life
in
quitting
this
charming
lake
and
again
entering
the
narrow
tortuous
course
of
the
river
we
bade
adieu
to
everything
like
scenery
until
we
should
reach
our
journey
end
we
had
now
seventy
miles
to
pass
through
a
country
perfectly
monotonous
and
uninteresting
the
distastefulness
of
which
was
aggravated
by
the
knowledge
that
we
could
had
we
been
provided
with
horses
or
a
carriage
of
any
kind
have
crossed
over
to
the
portage
from
gleason
through
a
pleasant
country
in
little
more
than
three
hours
even
our
great
resource
the
cheering
animating
songs
of
our
voyageurs
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
river
though
deep
is
so
narrow
that
in
many
places
there
is
no
room
for
the
regular
play
of
the
oars
and
the
voices
of
frenchmen
can
never
keep
tune
unless
their
oars
can
keep
time
lapierre
one
of
our
men
did
his
best
with
a
paddle
or
as
he
called
it
the
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
it
not
besides
this
the
wild
rice
abounds
to
such
an
extent
in
many
places
that
it
almost
completely
obstructs
the
progress
of
even
a
boat
so
that
a
passage
through
its
tangled
masses
is
with
difficulty
forced
by
the
oars
tedious
and
monotonous
as
was
the
whole
course
of
the
two
following
days
the
climax
of
impatience
and
discouragement
was
not
reached
until
we
arrived
in
sight
of
the
white
walls
of
fort
winnebago
looking
down
from
a
rising
ground
upon
the
vast
expanse
of
low
land
through
which
the
river
winds
the
indians
have
a
tradition
that
a
vast
serpent
once
lived
in
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
and
that
taking
a
freak
to
visit
the
great
lakes
he
left
his
trail
through
the
prairies
which
collecting
the
waters
from
the
meadows
and
the
rains
of
heaven
as
they
fell
at
length
became
the
fox
river
the
little
lakes
along
its
course
were
probably
the
spots
where
he
flourished
about
in
his
uneasy
slumbers
at
night
he
must
have
played
all
the
antics
of
a
kitten
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
portage
when
the
fort
was
first
pointed
out
to
me
i
exclaimed
with
delight
oh
we
shall
be
there
in
half
an
hour
not
quite
so
soon
said
my
husband
smiling
wait
and
see
we
sat
and
watched
we
seemed
approaching
the
very
spot
where
we
were
to
disembark
we
could
distinguish
the
officers
and
a
lady
on
the
bank
waiting
to
receive
us
now
we
were
turning
our
backs
on
them
and
shooting
out
into
the
prairie
again
anon
we
approached
another
bank
on
which
was
a
range
of
log
houses
that
the
agency
said
my
husband
the
largest
house
belongs
to
paquette
the
interpreter
and
the
others
are
the
dwellings
of
our
frenchmen
the
little
building
just
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
is
the
blacksmith
shop
kept
there
by
the
government
that
the
indians
may
have
their
guns
and
traps
mended
free
of
expense
but
are
we
going
to
stop
there
no
do
you
not
see
we
are
going
back
to
the
fort
and
to
be
sure
our
course
had
now
turned
and
we
were
setting
in
our
first
direction
in
this
manner
after
tacking
to
the
right
and
left
and
putting
backwards
and
forwards
during
the
greater
part
of
two
hours
we
at
length
reached
the
little
landing
on
which
the
assembled
party
stood
ready
to
greet
us
chapter
viii
fort
winnebago
major
and
twiggs
and
a
few
of
the
younger
officers
for
nearly
all
of
the
older
ones
were
absent
with
our
brother
robert
or
as
he
is
called
throughout
all
the
indian
tribes
bob
gave
us
a
cordial
welcome
how
cordial
those
alone
can
know
who
have
come
like
us
to
a
remote
isolated
home
in
the
wilderness
the
major
insisted
on
our
taking
possession
at
once
of
vacant
quarters
in
the
fort
instead
of
at
the
agency
as
had
been
proposed
no
we
must
be
under
the
same
roof
with
them
twiggs
had
been
without
a
companion
of
her
own
sex
for
more
than
four
months
and
would
certainly
not
hear
of
a
separation
now
but
we
must
be
their
guests
until
the
arrival
of
the
boats
containing
our
furniture
which
under
the
care
of
our
old
acquaintance
hamilton
arndt
was
making
its
way
slowly
up
from
green
bay
a
dinner
had
been
prepared
for
us
this
is
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
zigzag
approach
by
the
fox
river
travellers
never
take
their
friends
by
surprise
and
when
the
whole
circle
sat
down
to
the
hospitable
board
we
were
indeed
a
merry
company
after
dinner
twiggs
showed
me
the
quarters
assigned
to
us
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spacious
hall
they
consisted
of
two
large
rooms
on
each
of
the
three
floors
or
stories
of
the
building
on
the
the
front
room
was
vacant
the
one
in
the
rear
was
to
be
the
as
was
evident
from
a
huge
unwieldy
bedstead
of
proportions
amply
sufficient
to
have
accommodated
og
the
king
of
bashan
with
og
and
the
children
into
the
bargain
we
could
not
repress
our
laughter
but
the
bedstead
was
nothing
to
another
structure
which
occupied
a
second
corner
of
the
apartment
this
edifice
had
been
built
under
the
immediate
superintendence
of
one
of
our
young
lieutenants
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
upon
it
both
he
and
the
soldiers
who
fabricated
it
had
exhausted
all
their
architectural
skill
the
timbers
of
which
it
was
composed
had
been
grooved
and
carved
the
pillars
that
supported
the
front
swelled
in
and
out
in
a
most
fanciful
manner
the
doors
were
not
only
panelled
but
radiated
in
a
way
to
excite
the
admiration
of
all
unsophisticated
eyes
a
similar
piece
of
workmanship
had
been
erected
in
each
set
of
quarters
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
closets
an
inconvenience
which
had
never
occurred
until
too
late
to
the
bachelors
who
planned
them
the
three
apartments
of
which
each
structure
was
composed
were
unquestionably
designed
for
and
such
at
least
were
the
uses
to
which
twiggs
had
appropriated
the
one
assigned
to
her
there
was
this
slight
difficulty
that
in
the
latter
the
shelves
were
too
close
to
admit
of
setting
in
even
a
but
they
made
up
in
number
what
was
wanting
in
space
we
christened
the
whole
affair
in
honor
of
its
projector
a
davis
thus
placing
the
first
laurel
on
the
brow
of
one
who
was
afterwards
to
signalize
himself
in
making
of
quite
a
different
character
the
bold
promontory
on
which
fort
winnebago
was
built
looked
down
upon
the
extended
prairie
and
the
fox
river
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
stretched
away
into
the
ridge
that
led
off
to
belle
fontaine
and
lake
puckaway
in
front
lay
an
extent
of
meadow
across
which
was
the
portage
road
of
about
two
miles
in
length
leading
between
the
fox
and
the
wisconsin
rivers
teams
of
oxen
and
a
driver
were
kept
at
the
agency
by
the
government
to
transport
the
canoes
of
the
indians
across
this
place
which
at
many
seasons
was
wet
miry
and
almost
impassable
the
woods
were
now
brilliant
with
the
many
tints
of
autumn
and
the
scene
around
was
further
enlivened
by
groups
of
indians
in
all
directions
and
their
lodges
which
were
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
vicinity
of
the
agency
buildings
on
the
low
grounds
might
be
seen
the
white
tents
of
the
traders
already
prepared
to
furnish
winter
supplies
to
the
indians
in
exchange
for
the
annuity
money
they
were
about
to
receive
a
great
concourse
had
been
for
many
days
assembling
in
anticipation
of
the
payment
which
was
expected
to
take
place
as
soon
as
should
arrive
with
the
silver
preparatory
to
this
event
the
great
chief
of
the
nation
whose
village
we
had
passed
at
the
entrance
to
winnebago
lake
had
thought
proper
to
take
a
little
carouse
as
is
too
apt
to
be
the
custom
when
the
savages
come
into
the
neighborhood
of
a
sutler
establishment
in
the
present
instance
the
facilities
for
a
season
of
intoxication
had
been
augmented
by
the
presence
on
the
ground
of
some
traders
too
regardless
of
the
very
stringent
laws
prohibiting
the
sale
of
liquor
to
the
indians
poor
could
not
stand
this
full
tide
of
prosperity
unchecked
by
the
presence
of
his
father
the
agent
he
carried
his
indulgence
to
such
excess
that
he
fell
a
victim
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
his
funeral
had
been
celebrated
with
unusual
pomp
the
day
before
our
arrival
and
great
was
my
disappointment
at
finding
myself
too
late
to
witness
all
the
ceremonies
his
body
according
to
their
custom
having
been
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
placed
in
a
rude
coffin
along
with
his
guns
tomahawk
pipes
and
a
quantity
of
tobacco
had
been
carried
to
the
most
elevated
point
of
the
hill
opposite
the
fort
followed
by
an
immense
procession
of
his
people
whooping
beating
their
drums
howling
and
making
altogether
what
is
emphatically
termed
a
after
the
interment
of
the
body
a
stake
was
planted
at
its
head
on
which
was
painted
in
vermilion
a
series
of
hieroglyphics
descriptive
of
the
great
deeds
and
events
of
his
life
the
whole
was
then
surrounded
with
pickets
of
the
trunks
of
the
and
hither
the
friends
would
come
for
many
successive
days
to
renew
the
expression
of
their
grief
and
to
throw
over
the
grave
tobacco
and
other
offerings
to
the
great
spirit
it
was
a
consolation
to
find
that
although
delayed
we
were
yet
in
time
to
furnish
a
quantity
of
white
cotton
for
a
flag
to
wave
over
the
grave
and
also
to
pay
a
considerable
bill
at
the
sutler
for
the
different
articles
that
had
been
found
necessary
for
the
funeral
parade
it
being
a
duty
expected
of
their
father
to
bury
the
dead
suitably
the
funeral
observances
in
honor
of
the
chief
had
not
yet
ceased
throughout
the
day
and
all
that
night
the
sound
of
instruments
mingled
with
doleful
lamentations
and
with
the
discordant
whoops
and
yells
of
those
in
a
partial
state
of
intoxication
filled
the
air
and
disturbed
our
repose
to
these
were
added
occasionally
the
plaintive
sounds
of
the
indian
flute
upon
which
the
young
savage
plays
when
he
is
in
love
grief
and
whiskey
had
made
their
hearts
tender
and
the
woods
resounded
to
their
melancholy
strains
early
the
following
morning
before
i
left
my
room
i
was
startled
by
the
sounds
of
lamentation
and
woe
proceeding
from
the
adjoining
apartment
on
entering
it
i
found
several
squaws
seated
on
the
floor
with
downcast
looks
expressive
of
condolence
and
sympathy
while
in
their
midst
sat
a
little
ugly
woman
in
tattered
garments
with
blackened
face
and
dishevelled
hair
sobbing
and
wailing
bitterly
not
doubting
they
were
the
family
of
the
deceased
chief
i
was
quite
troubled
at
my
inability
to
express
otherwise
than
by
gestures
my
participation
in
their
sorrows
unacquainted
as
i
was
with
their
customs
i
took
it
for
granted
from
their
wretched
appearance
that
poverty
and
destitution
formed
one
of
the
sources
of
their
affliction
one
of
the
party
at
least
seemed
in
the
very
depths
of
misery
can
it
be
possible
said
i
to
myself
that
this
poor
creature
has
only
these
scanty
rags
to
cover
her
stepping
back
to
my
own
room
i
brought
out
a
pretty
calico
wrapper
which
i
presented
to
the
little
dirty
blackened
object
she
took
it
and
commenced
a
fresh
series
of
sobbing
and
sighing
i
made
signs
to
her
to
put
it
on
opening
it
and
explaining
to
her
how
it
was
to
be
worn
and
recommending
to
her
by
gestures
to
lose
no
time
in
making
herself
more
comfortable
at
this
the
other
women
burst
into
a
laugh
very
thought
i
and
somewhat
unfeeling
at
that
moment
my
husband
entering
explained
to
me
that
the
chief
mourner
was
madame
the
widow
that
she
had
undoubtedly
a
comfortable
wardrobe
at
home
but
that
it
was
part
of
the
etiquette
of
mourning
to
go
for
a
season
with
neglected
persons
and
blackened
faces
all
this
was
told
me
in
the
intervals
of
shaking
hands
and
offering
and
receiving
condolences
in
the
most
uncouth
guttural
language
i
had
ever
heard
their
father
at
length
dismissed
them
with
a
promise
of
some
presents
to
help
dry
up
their
tears
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
the
grief
of
the
poor
little
widow
was
not
sincere
on
the
contrary
she
was
greatly
attached
to
her
husband
and
had
had
great
influence
not
only
with
him
but
with
the
nation
at
large
she
was
a
fox
woman
and
spoke
the
chippewa
which
is
the
court
language
among
all
the
tribes
so
that
she
was
often
called
upon
to
act
as
interpreter
and
had
in
fact
been
in
the
habit
of
accompanying
her
husband
and
assisting
him
by
her
counsels
upon
all
occasions
she
was
a
person
of
great
shrewdness
and
judgment
and
as
i
afterwards
experienced
of
strong
and
tenacious
affections
after
breakfast
i
received
a
visit
from
the
principal
chiefs
who
had
put
on
their
best
of
apparel
and
paint
to
receive
their
new
mother
there
was
or
the
walking
turtle
now
the
principal
chief
of
the
nation
a
stalwart
indian
with
a
broad
pleasant
countenance
the
great
peculiarity
of
which
was
an
immense
under
lip
hanging
nearly
to
his
chin
there
was
the
old
the
most
noble
dignified
and
venerable
of
his
own
or
indeed
of
any
tribe
his
fine
roman
countenance
rendered
still
more
striking
by
his
bald
head
with
one
solitary
tuft
of
long
silvery
hair
neatly
tied
and
falling
back
on
his
shoulders
his
perfectly
neat
appropriate
dress
almost
without
ornament
and
his
courteous
demeanor
never
laid
aside
under
any
circumstances
all
combined
to
give
him
the
highest
place
in
the
consideration
of
all
who
knew
him
it
will
hereafter
be
seen
that
his
traits
of
character
were
not
less
grand
and
striking
than
were
his
personal
appearance
and
deportment
there
was
whose
lowering
surly
face
was
well
described
by
his
name
the
fierce
expression
of
his
countenance
was
greatly
heightened
by
the
masses
of
heavy
black
hair
hanging
round
it
quite
contrary
to
the
usual
fashion
among
the
winnebagoes
they
for
the
most
part
remove
a
portion
of
their
hair
the
remainder
of
which
is
drawn
to
the
back
of
the
head
clubbed
and
ornamented
with
beads
ribbons
feathers
or
if
they
are
so
entitled
an
eagle
feather
for
every
scalp
taken
from
an
enemy
there
was
a
remarkably
handsome
powerful
young
indian
who
received
his
name
in
the
following
manner
he
was
one
of
a
party
of
sixteen
winnebagoes
who
had
by
invitation
accompanied
their
agent
and
major
forsyth
or
the
chippewa
as
he
was
called
on
a
visit
to
the
president
at
washington
the
year
previous
on
the
journey
the
question
naturally
addressed
to
them
by
people
not
familiar
with
western
indians
was
do
you
talk
english
the
young
fellow
being
very
observant
came
to
his
father
what
do
they
mean
by
this
everybody
says
to
me
english
the
agent
interpreted
the
words
to
him
ah
very
well
the
next
place
they
arrived
at
was
lockport
in
the
state
of
new
york
jumping
off
the
upon
the
lock
he
ran
up
to
the
first
man
he
met
and
thrusting
forward
his
face
cried
out
talk
eengeesh
yes
said
the
man
do
you
talk
english
from
that
time
forward
he
always
bore
the
name
of
and
was
registered
on
the
by
a
title
of
which
he
was
not
a
little
proud
the
little
elk
was
another
of
the
distinguished
men
of
the
tribe
he
had
likewise
been
at
washington
henry
clay
when
he
visited
them
after
looking
carefully
at
the
countenances
and
bearing
of
all
the
members
of
the
deputation
had
indicated
him
as
the
one
possessing
the
greatest
talent
and
he
was
greatly
pleased
when
informed
that
he
was
the
principal
orator
of
the
nation
and
decidedly
superior
in
abilities
to
any
other
individual
of
the
tribe
our
indian
falstaff
in
all
save
the
cowardice
and
falsehood
i
have
already
mentioned
then
there
was
the
white
crow
a
rock
river
indian
who
afterwards
distinguished
himself
as
the
friend
of
the
whites
during
the
sauk
war
he
was
called
by
the
french
le
borgne
from
having
lost
an
eye
and
the
black
silk
handkerchief
which
he
wore
drooping
over
the
left
side
of
his
face
to
disguise
the
blemish
taken
with
his
native
costume
gave
him
a
very
singular
appearance
there
was
a
nephew
of
the
defunct
chief
to
whom
with
justice
was
given
by
both
whites
and
indians
the
appellation
of
the
dandy
when
out
of
mourning
his
dress
was
of
the
most
studied
and
fanciful
character
a
shirt
when
he
condescended
to
wear
any
of
the
brightest
colors
ornamented
with
innumerable
rows
of
silver
brooches
set
thickly
together
never
less
than
two
pairs
of
silver
leggings
and
moccasins
of
the
most
elaborate
embroidery
in
ribbons
and
everything
that
he
could
devise
in
the
shape
of
ornament
hanging
to
his
club
of
hair
behind
a
feather
fan
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
mirror
in
which
he
contemplated
himself
every
five
minutes
these
with
the
variety
and
brilliancy
of
the
colors
upon
his
face
the
suitable
choice
and
application
of
which
occupied
no
small
portion
of
the
hours
allotted
to
his
toilet
made
up
the
equipment
of
young
this
devotion
to
dress
and
appearance
seemed
not
altogether
out
of
place
in
a
youthful
dandy
but
we
had
likewise
an
old
one
of
the
same
stamp
pawnee
blanc
or
the
white
pawnee
surpassed
his
younger
competitor
if
possible
in
attention
to
his
personal
attractions
upon
the
present
occasion
he
appeared
in
all
his
finery
and
went
through
the
customary
salutations
with
an
air
of
solemn
dignity
then
walked
as
did
the
others
into
the
parlor
for
i
had
received
them
in
the
hall
where

pretty

if
this
is
to
be
the
way
they
pay
their

watched

long
pipes

the
other
inconveniences

absolute
dismay
the
visit
of

was
succeeded
by

from

and
his

all
the

husbands
found
employment

housekeeping
as
the
boats
might
be
expected
in
a
few
days
it
was
thought
best
to
begin
at
once
what
preparations
were
in
my
power
towards
housekeeping
these
were
simply
the
fitting
and
sewing
of
my
carpets
in
which
i
was
kindly
assisted
by
twiggs
and
the
wife
of
one
of
our
frenchmen
having
come
over
from
the
agency
and
made
everything
tidy
and
comfortable
the
carpets
were
soon
tacked
down
and
the
rooms
were
ready
for
the
reception
of
the
rest
of
the
furniture
i
had
made
many
fruitless
attempts
both
in
detroit
and
green
bay
to
procure
a
to
accompany
me
to
my
new
home
sometimes
one
would
present
herself
but
before
we
could
come
to
a
final
agreement
the
thoughts
of
the
distance
of
the
savages
the
hardships
of
the
journey
or
perhaps
the
objections
of
friends
would
interfere
to
break
off
the
negotiation
so
that
i
had
at
length
been
obliged
to
rest
satisfied
with
the
simple
hope
held
out
by
my
husband
that
one
of
his
french
employés
with
his
wife
would
be
contented
to
take
up
their
abode
with
us
in
this
state
of
things
all
difficulties
seemed
to
be
obviated
by
the
proposal
of
major
twiggs
that
we
should
take
into
our
service
a
young
colored
girl
whom
he
had
brought
from
buffalo
in
the
spring
to
wait
on
until
her
own
servants
should
arrive
from
the
south
louisa
was
accordingly
sent
for
an
uncommonly
handsome
young
negress
with
an
intelligent
but
very
demure
countenance
who
called
herself
fifteen
years
of
age
but
who
from
the
progress
in
vice
and
iniquity
i
afterwards
discovered
her
to
have
made
must
have
been
at
least
several
years
older
be
that
as
it
may
she
now
seemed
to
have
no
fault
but
carelessness
and
inexperience
both
of
which
i
had
great
hopes
she
would
get
the
better
of
under
careful
training
my
first
week
visit
with
twiggs
had
just
expired
when
word
was
given
that
the
boats
were
in
sight
the
boats
that
contained
our
furniture
and
the
expected
arrival
of
louis
philippe
to
visit
queen
victoria
could
scarcely
have
created
a
more
universal
sensation
than
did
this
announcement
in
our
little
community
although
we
knew
that
some
hours
must
yet
elapse
before
they
could
reach
the
spot
for
disembarkation
we
were
constantly
on
the
watch
and
at
length
all
the
young
officers
followed
by
as
many
of
the
soldiers
as
were
off
duty
accompanied
kinzie
down
the
bank
to
the
landing
to
witness
and
if
necessary
to
assist
in
helping
everything
safe
to
land
sad
was
the
plight
in
which
matters
were
found
the
water
poured
out
of
the
corners
of
the
boxes
as
they
were
successively
hoisted
on
shore
too
impatient
to
wait
until
they
could
be
carried
up
to
the
fort
the
gentlemen
soon
furnished
themselves
with
hammers
and
hatchets
and
fell
eagerly
to
work
opening
the
boxes
to
explore
the
extent
of
the
damage
alas
for
the
mahogany
not
a
piece
from
which
the
edges
and
veneering
were
not
starting
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
having
lain
under
the
grande
chûte
for
days
poor
hamilton
was
load
in
his
protestations
and
excuses
it
was
the
fault
of
the
men
of
the
weather
of
the
way
the
things
were
packed
confound
it
he
had
taken
the
best
care
of
the
things
he
possibly
could
better
than
he
had
ever
taken
before
it

done
there
was
nothing
but
to
be
patient
and
make
the
best
of
it

the
pretty

had
been
thoroughly
rubbed
and
set
up

all
the

arranged

were
hung
at
the
windows

in
its
proper
place
in

our
parlor
was
pronounced
magnificent
at

so
seemed
to
think
hamilton
who
came
to
give
one
admiring
look
and
to
hear
the
music
of
the
piano
which
was
a
perfect
novelty
to
him
his
description
of
it
to
the
young
officers
after
his
return
to
the
bay
was
expressive
of
his
admiration
and
wonder
there
it
stood
on
its
four
legs
anybody
might
go
up
and
touch
it

carefully
bestowed
in

with
sundry
jars
of
sweetmeats
that
i
had
prepared
in

were
placed
in

supplied

the
barrel
of
eggs
and
tubs
of
butter
brought
all
the
way
from

were
ranged
in

a
suitable
quantity
of
salt
pork
and
flour
was
purchased
from
the
commissary
and
there
being
no
lack
of
game
of
every
description
the
offering
of
our
red
children
we
were
ready
to
commence
housekeeping
the
first
dinner
in
her
own
home
is
an
era
in
the
life
of
a
young
housekeeper
i
shall
certainly
never
forget
mine
while
i
was
in
the
lower
regions
superintending
my
very
inexpert
little
cook
my
husband
made
his
appearance
to
say
that
as
the
payment
then
the
topic
of
interest
would
not
commence
until
afternoon
he
had
invited
rolette
hempstead
and
four
other
gentlemen
to
dine
with
us
so
unexpected
so
unprepared
for
never
mind
give
them
anything
you
have
they
have
been
living
for
some
days
in
tents
and
anything
will
taste
well
to
them
my
dinner
had
been
intended
to
consist
chiefly
of
a
venison
pasty
and
fortunately
the
only
dish
among
my
store
was
of
very
large
proportions
so
that
there
was
already
smoking
in
the
oven
a
pie
of
a
size
nearly
equal
to
the
famous
norwich
pudding
thus
with
some
trifling
additions
to
the
bill
of
fare
we
made
out
very
well
and
the
master
of
the
house
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
the
impromptu
dinner
very
much
commended
by
his
six
guests

washington
there
were
two
divisions
of
the
winnebago
indians
one
of
which
was
paid
by
the
agent
at
the
portage
the
other
at

between
four
and
five
thousand

a
considerable
amount
of
presents
and
a
certain
number
of
rations
of
bread
and
pork
to
be
issued
in
times
of
emergency
throughout
the
year
the
principal

of
this
division

were
at

were

before

the
different

to
notify
the

the
number
in

lodges
to
be
registered

paying
a
certain
sum
of
money
is
apportioned
to
each
individual
it
is
of
course
an
object
to
the
head
of
a
lodge
to
make
the
number
registered
as
great
as
possible
each
one
brings
his
little
bundle
of
sticks
and
presents
it
to
the
agent
to
register
sometimes
a
dialogue
like
the
following
occurs
how
many
have
you
in
your
lodge
the
indian
carefully
and
with
great
ceremony
counts
his
bundle
of
sticks

how
many

the
agent
lays
aside
two
sticks
how
many
women
three
three
more
sticks
are
separated
how
many
children
eight
eight
sticks
are
added
to
the
heap
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
two
sticks
that
remain
the
culprit
whose
arithmetic
has
not
served
him
to
carry
out
his
deception
disappears
amid
the
shouts
and
jeers
of
his
companions
who
are
always
well
pleased
at
the
detection
of
any
roguery
in
which
they
have
had
no
share
the
young
officers
generally
assisted
in
counting
out
and
delivering
the
money
at
these
payments
and
it
was
no
unusual
thing
as
the
last
band
came
up
for
the
chiefs
to
take
a
quantity
of
silver
out
of
the
box
and
request
their
father
to
pay
his
friends
for
their
trouble
seeming
really
disturbed
at
his
refusal
in
this
as
in
almost
every
instance
we
see
the
native
courtesy
and
politeness
which
are
never
lost
sight
of
among
them
if
a
party
comes
to
their
father
to
beg
for
provisions
and
food
is
offered
them
however
hungry
they
may
be
each
waits
patiently
until
one
of
the
company
makes
an
equal
distribution
of
the
whole
and
then
taking
his
share
eats
it
quietly
with
the
greatest
moderation
i
never
saw
this
rule
violated
save
in
one
instance
our
friend
pawnee
blanc
old
once
came
with
a
party
of
indians
requesting
permission
to
dance
for
us
in
the
open
space
before
the
door
it
was
a
warm
dusty
afternoon
and
as
our
friends
grew
heated
and
fatigued
with
the
violent
and
exercise
a
pitcher
of
raspberry
negus
was
prepared
and
sent
out
to
them
pawnee
received
the
pitcher
and
tumbler
and
pouring
the
latter
about
half
full
gave
it
to
the
first
of
the
circle
then
filled
the
same
for
the
next
and
so
on
until
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
look
into
the
pitcher
what
he
saw
there
determined
his
course
of
action
so
setting
the
tumbler
upon
the
ground
he
raised
the
pitcher
with
both
hands
to
his
lips
and
gave
a
hearty
pull
after
which
he
went
on
giving
less
and
less
until
he
was
called
to
have
the
pitcher
replenished
all
present
agreed
it
was
the
only
instance
they
had
ever
witnessed
of
an
indian
appearing
afraid
of
getting
less
of
a
thing
than
his
share
during
the
payment
a
good
many
kegs
of
whiskey
find
their
way
into
the
lodges
of
the
indians
notwithstanding
the
watchfulness
of
both
officers
and
agent
where
there
is
a
demand
there
will
always
be
a
supply
let
the
legal
prohibitions
be
what
they
may
the
last
day
of
the
payment
is
invariably
one
of
general
carousing
when
the
men
begin
their
the
women
carefully
gather
all
the
guns
knives
tomahawks
and
weapons
of
every
description
and
secrete
them
that
as
little
mischief
as
possible
may
be
done
in
the
absence
of
all
restraint
and
reason
i
am
sorry
to
record
that
our
little
friend
pawnee
blanc
was
greatly
addicted
to
the
pleasures
of
the
bottle
among
the
presents
for
the
chiefs
which
had
brought
from
the
east
was
a
trunk
of
blue
cloth
coats
trimmed
with
broad
gold
lace
and
a
box
of
round
black
hats
ornamented
in
a
similar
manner
all
who
are
familiar
with
indians
of
whatever
tribe
will
have
observed
that
their
first
step
towards
civilization
whether
in
man
or
woman
is
mounting
a
man
hat
decorated
with
tinsel
ribbons
or
feathers
pawnee
was
among
the
happy
number
remembered
in
the
distribution
so
donning
at
once
his
new
costume
and
tying
a
few
additional
bunches
of
ribbons
to
a
long
spear
that
was
always
his
baton
of
ceremony
he
came
at
once
followed
by
an
admiring
train
chiefly
of
women
to
pay
me
a
visit
of
state
the
solemn
gravity
of
his
countenance
as
he
motioned
away
those
who
would
approach
too
near
and
finger
his
finery
the
dignity
with
which
he
strutted
along
edging
this
way
and
that
to
avoid
any
possible
contact
from
homely
wardrobes
augured
well
for
a
continuance
of
propriety
and
and
a
due
consideration
of
the
good
opinion
of
all
around
but
alas
for
pawnee
late
in
the
day
we
saw
him
assisted
towards
his
lodge
by
two
stout
young
indians
who
had
pulled
him
out
of
a
ditch
his
fine
coat
covered
with
mud
his
hat
battered
and
bruised
his
spear
shorn
of
its
gay
streamers
and
poor
pawnee
himself
weeping
and
uttering
all
the
doleful
lamentations
of
a
tipsy
indian
among
the
women
with
whom
i
early
made
acquaintance
was
the
wife
of
yellow
she
had
accompanied
her
husband
who
was
one
of
the
deputation
to
visit
the
president
and
from
that
time
forth
she
had
been
known
as
the
washington
woman
she
had
a
pleasant
sort
of
air
in
greeting
me
as
much
as
to
say
you
and
i
have
seen
something
of
the
world
no
expression
of
surprise
or
admiration
escaped
her
lips
as
her
companions
with
childlike
laughing
simplicity
exclaimed
and
clapped
their
hands
at
the
different
wonderful
objects
i
showed
them
her
deportment
said
plainly
yes
yes
my
children
i
have
seen
all
these
things
before
it
was
not
until
i
put
to
her
ear
a
tropical
shell
of
which
i
had
a
little
cabinet
and
she
heard
its
murmuring
sound
that
she
laid
aside
her
apathy
of
manner
she
poked
her
finger
into
the
opening
to
get
at
the
animal
within
shook
it
violently
then
raised
it
to
her
ear
again
and
finally
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
laid
it
down
acknowledging
by
her
looks
that
this
was
beyond
her
comprehension
i
had
one
shell
of
peculiar
beauty
my
favorite
in
the
whole
collection
a
small
conch
covered
with
rich
dark
veins
each
of
the
visitors
successively
took
up
this
shell
and
by
words
and
gestures
expressed
her
admiration
evidently
showing
that
she
had
an
eye
for
beauty
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
parting
visit
of
my
red
daughters
shortly
after
the
payment
had
been
completed
and
the
indians
had
left
i
discovered
that
my
valued
shell
was
missing
from
the
collection
could
it
be
that
one
of
the
squaws
had
stolen
it
it
was
possible
they
would
occasionally
though
rarely
do
such
things
under
the
influence
of
strong
temptation
i
tried
to
recollect
which
among
the
party
looked
most
likely
to
have
been
the
culprit
it
could
not
have
been
the
washington
woman
she
was
partly
civilized
and
knew
better
a
few
weeks
afterwards
again
made
her
appearance
and
carefully
unfolding
a
chintz
shawl
which
she
carried
rolled
up
in
her
hand
she
produced
the
shell
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
me
i
did
not
know
whether
to
show
by
my
countenance
displeasure
at
the
trick
she
had
played
me
or
joy
at
receiving
my
treasure
back
again
but
at
length
decided
that
it
was
the
best
policy
to
manifest
no
emotion
whatever
she
prolonged
her
visit
until
my
husband
return
and
he
then
questioned
her
about
the
matter
she
had
taken
the
shell
to
her
village
to
show
to
some
of
her
people
who
did
not
come
to
the
payment
why
had
she
not
asked
her
mother
leave
before
carrying
it
away
because
she
saw
that
her
mother
liked
the
shell
and
she
was
afraid
she
would
say
no
this
was
not
the
first
instance
in
which
madame
washington
had
displayed
the
shrewdness
which
was
a
predominant
trait
in
her
character
during
the
visit
of
the
indians
to
the
eastern
cities
they
were
taken
to
various
exhibitions
museums
menageries
theatres
etc
it
did
not
escape
their
observation
that
some
silver
was
always
paid
before
entrance
and
they
inquired
the
reason
it
was
explained
to
them
the
woman
brightened
up
as
if
struck
with
an
idea
how
much
do
you
pay
for
each
one
her
father
told
her
how
do
you
say
that
in
english
two
shillings
shinnin
good
the
next
day
when
as
usual
visitors
began
to
flock
to
the
rooms
where
the
indians
were
sojourning
the
woman
and
a
young
indian
her
confederate
took
their
station
by
the
door
which
they
kept
closed
when
any
one
knocked
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
and
the
woman
extending
her
hand
exclaimed
this
was
readily
paid
in
each
instance
and
the
game
went
on
until
she
had
accumulated
a
considerable
sum
but
this
did
not
satisfy
her
at
the
first
attempt
of
a
visitor
to
leave
the
room
the
door
was
held
close
as
before
the
hand
was
extended
and
again
met
his
ear
he
tried
to
explain
that
having
paid
for
his
entrance
he
must
go
out
free
with
an
innocent
shake
of
the
head
was
all
the
english
she
could
understand
the
agent
who
had
entered
a
short
time
before
and
who
overhearing
the
dialogue
sat
laughing
behind
his
newspaper
waiting
to
see
how
it
would
all
end
now
came
forward
and
interfered
and
the
guests
were
permitted
to
go
forth
without
a
further
contribution
the
good
woman
was
moreover
admonished
that
it
was
far
from
the
custom
of
white
people
to
tax
their
friends
and
visitors
in
this
manner
and
that
the
practice
must
be
laid
aside
in
future
another
instance
of
the
disposition
of
the
indians
to
avail
themselves
of
all
the
goods
that
fortune
throws
in
their
way
was
the
following
upon
the
same
trip
while
passing
through
ohio
one
of
the
party
inquired
of
the
agent
do
you
pay
for
all
those
provisions
that
are
set
before
us
at
the
hotels
yes
why
do
you
ask
nothing
i
thought
you
perhaps
paid
for
just
what
we
ate
of
them
at
the
next
a
fine
breakfast
was
set
upon
the
table
of
which
as
usual
they
partook
plentifully
just
as
they
had
finished
the
horn
sounded
for
all
to
take
their
places
in
the
each
sprang
to
his
feet
one
seized
the
plates
of
biscuits
and
poured
them
into
the
corner
of
his
blanket
another
the
remains
of
a
pair
of
chickens
a
third
emptied
the
each
laid
hold
of
what
was
nearest
him
and
in
a
trice
nothing
was
left
upon
the
table
but
the
empty
plates
and
dishes
the
landlord
and
waiters
meanwhile
stood
laughing
and
enjoying
the
trick
as
much
as
any
of
the
spectators
upon
another
occasion
their
father
had
endeavored
to
impress
upon
them
the
unseemliness
of
throwing
their
refuse
pieces
bones
and
fragments
of
food
about
on
the
pointing
out
to
them
the
orderly
manner
of
the
whites
at
table
and
the
propriety
of
keeping
everything
neat
and
nice
around
them
at
their
next
meal
they
were
served
first
with
a
of
which
they
ate
very
heartily
and
the
accumulation
of
bones
on
their
plates
was
very
abundant
presently
another
and
more
favorite
dish
appeared
a
fine
large
roasted
turkey
a
gentleman
sat
near
and
was
evidently
preparing
to
carve
it
no
time
was
to
be
lost
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
bones
they
looked
around
in
some
perplexity
a
large
was
standing
near
the
most
eager
drew
it
towards
him
and
quick
as
thought
all
the
bones
were
deposited
upon
it
while
with
a
triumphant
laugh
at
the
happy
idea
he
coolly
transferred
the
bird
to
his
own
dish
and
proceeded
to
distribute
it
among
his
companions
the
amazed
stranger
soon
joined
in
the
laugh
at
the
unceremonious
manner
in
which
his
share
of
the
dinner
had
vanished
chapter
xi
louisa
on
education
the
payment
was
now
over
and
the
indians
had
dispersed
and
gone
to
their
wintering
grounds
the
traders
too
had
departed
laden
with
a
good
share
of
the
silver
in
exchange
for
which
each
family
had
provided
itself
as
far
as
possible
with
clothing
guns
traps
ammunition
and
the
other
necessaries
for
their
winter
use
the
indians
are
good
at
a
bargain
they
are
not
easily
overreached
on
the
contrary
they
understand
at
once
when
a
charge
is
exorbitant
and
a
trader
who
tries
his
shrewdness
upon
them
is
sure
to
receive
an
expressive
which
ever
after
clings
to
him
for
instance
rolette
was
called
by
them
because
as
they
said
let
them
offer
what
number
of
skins
they
might
in
bartering
for
an
article
his
terms
were
invariably
five
more
upon
one
occasion
a
lady
remarked
to
him
oh
rolette
i
would
not
be
engaged
in
the
indian
trade
it
seems
to
me
a
system
of
cheating
the
poor
indians
let
me
tell
you
madame
replied
he
with
great
it
is
not
so
easy
a
thing
to
cheat
the
indians
as
you
imagine
i
have
tried
it
these
twenty
years
and
have
never
succeeded
we
were
now
settled
down
to
a
quiet
domestic
life
the
military
system
under
which
everything
was
conducted
the
followed
by
the
music
of
a
very
good
band
at
reveille
the
light
animated
strains
for
and
soon
after
for
breakfast
the
longer
ceremony
of
the
old
english
to
announce
the
the
sweet
plaintive
strains
of
lochaber
no
more
followed
most
incongruously
by
the
little
at
retreat
and
finally
the
long
rolling
tattoo
late
in
the
evening
made
pleasant
divisions
of
our
time
which
by
the
aid
of
books
music
and
drawing
in
addition
to
household
occupations
seemed
to
fly
more
swiftly
than
ever
before
it
was
on
sunday
that
i
most
missed
my
eastern
home
i
had
planned
beforehand
what
we
should
do
on
the
first
recurrence
of
this
sacred
day
under
our
own
roof
we
shall
have
at
least
said
i
to
myself
the
sabbath
quiet
and
repose
and
i
can
among
other
things
benefit
poor
louisa
by
giving
her
some
additional
lessons
of
a
serious
character
so
while
she
was
removing
the
i
said
to
her
now
louisa
get
your
work
all
finished
and
everything
put
neatly
aside
and
then
come
here
to
me
again
yes
we
sat
down
to
our
books
and
read
and
waited
we
waited
and
read
another
hour
no
louisa
there
was
music
and
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
parade
in
front
of
our
windows
but
that
did
not
disturb
us
it
was
what
we
were
daily
accustomed
to
i
must
go
at
length
and
see
what
could
be
keeping
my
damsel
so
i
descended
to
the
kitchen
the
stood
upon
the
table
the
kettles
and
spider
upon
the
hearth
the
fire
was
out
the
kitchen
empty
passing
back
into
the
hall
which
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
house
and
opened
in
front
upon
the
parade
i
perceived
a
group
collected
in
the
area
of
all
shades
and
colors
and
in
the
midst
one
round
woolly
head
which
i
could
not
mistake
bobbing
up
and
down
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
while
peals
of
laughter
were
issuing
from
the
whole
group
louisa
i
called
come
here
what
are
you
doing
there
looking
at
inspection
but
why
are
not
your
washed
and
your
kitchen
swept
did
i
not
tell
you
i
wished
you
to
come
up
and
learn
your
lessons
yes
but
i
had
to
see
inspection
first
everybody
looks
at
inspection
on
sunday
i
found
it
was
in
vain
to
expect
to
do
more
for
louisa
than
give
her
an
afternoon
lesson
and
with
that
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
i
felt
that
it
would
be
very
pleasant
and
perhaps
profitable
for
all
the
inmates
of
the
garrison
to
assemble
on
this
day
one
of
our
number
might
be
found
who
would
read
a
portion
of
the
with
a
sermon
from
one
of
our
different
selections
i
approached
the
subject
cautiously
with
an
inquiry
to
this
effect
are
there
none
among
the
officers
who
are
religiously
disposed
oh
yes
replied
the
one
whom
i
addressed
there
is
s
when
he
is
half
tipsy
he
takes
his
bible
and
works
and
goes
to
bed
and
cries
over
them
he
thinks
in
this
way
he
is
excessively
pious
s
was
among
the
officers
who
had
never
called
upon
us
it
was
fair
to
infer
that
if
his
religious
principles
did
not
correct
his
own
evil
habits
they
would
not
aid
much
in
improving
others
therefore
it
seemed
useless
to
call
in
his
in
any
scheme
for
a
better
observance
of
the
lord
day
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
writing
to
our
friends
at
the
east
to
interest
themselves
in
getting
a
missionary
sent
to
us
who
should
officiate
as
chaplain
in
the
garrison
a
plan
that
seemed
to
find
favor
with
the
officers
the
hope
of
any
united
religious
services
was
for
the
present
laid
aside
the
having
obtained
a
furlough
his
place
was
supplied
by
newhall
of
galena
and
thus
by
the
addition
of
his
gentle
quiet
wife
our
circle
of
ladies
was
now
enlarged
to
three
here
we
were
in
a
wilderness
but
yet
how
contented
and
happy
a
gloom
was
soon
to
replace
this
envied
tranquillity
in
our
home
a
frenchman
named
letendre
one
day
suddenly
presented
himself
he
had
come
from
chicago
with
the
distressing
intelligence
of
the
extreme
indeed
hopeless
illness
of
our
dear
relative
wolcott
my
husband
immediately
commenced
his
preparations
for
instant
departure
i
begged
to
be
permitted
to
accompany
him
but
the
rapidity
with
which
he
proposed
to
journey
obliged
him
to
refuse
my
entreaties
in
a
few
hours
his
provisions
horses
and
all
other
things
necessary
for
the
journey
were
in
readiness
and
he
set
off
with
petaille
grignon
his
usual
attendant
on
such
expeditions
leaving
letendre
to
follow
as
soon
as
recruited
from
his
fatigue
sad
and
dreary
were
the
hours
of
his
absence
notwithstanding
the
kind
efforts
of
our
friends
to
cheer
me
in
a
few
days
i
received
the
news
of
the
fatal
termination
of
illness
brought
by
another
messenger
that
noble
heart
so
full
of
warm
and
kindly
affections
had
ceased
to
beat
and
sad
and
desolate
indeed
were
those
who
had
so
loved
and
honored
him
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
leave
his
family
my
husband
returned
and
it
was
fortunate
that
he
had
delayed
no
longer
for
the
winter
now
began
to
set
in
and
with
severity
our
quarters
were
spacious
but
having
been
constructed
of
the
green
trees
of
the
forest
cut
down
and
sawed
into
boards
by
the
bands
of
the
soldiers
they
were
considerably
given
to
shrinking
and
warping
thus
leaving
many
a
yawning
crevice
stuffing
the
cracks
with
cotton
batting
and
pasting
strips
of
paper
over
them
formed
the
employment
of
many
a
leisure
hour
then
the
chimneys
spite
of
all
the
currents
of
air
which
might
have
been
expected
to
create
a
draught
had
a
sad
habit
of
smoking
to
remedy
this
a
couple
of
were
by
order
of
the
commanding
officer
sawed
off
and
inserted
in
the
hearth
one
on
each
side
of
the
in
the
hope
that
the
air
from
the
room
below
might
help
to
carry
the
smoke
into
its
proper
place
the
chimney
the
next
morning
after
this
had
been
done
louisa
was
washing
the
hearth
pray
said
she
what
are
these
things
put
in
here
for
i
explained
their
use
oh
i
am
so
glad
it
is
only
that
uncle
ephraim
major
servant
said
they
were
to
be
filled
with
powder
and
fired
off
christmas
day
and
he
was
terribly
afraid
they
would
blow
the
house
up
and
we
in
it
ephraim
who
was
a
most
faithful
and
valuable
servant
often
amused
himself
with
playing
upon
the
credulity
of
the
younger
portions
of
the
colored
fraternity
is
it
true
asked
louisa
one
day
that
pillon
and
plante
were
once
what
an
idea
why
do
you
ask
such
a
foolish
question
because
uncle
ephraim
says
they
and
all
the
frenchmen
about
here
were
once
and
that
living
so
near
the
white
people
they
grow
after
a
time
to
be
like
them
and
learn
to
talk
and
dress
like
them
and
then
when
they
get
to
be
old
they
turn
back
into
again
and
that
all
the
wolves
that
the
officers
bait
with
their
dogs
used
to
be
frenchmen
once
after
a
time
however
i
ceased
to
straighten
out
these
stories
of
uncle
ephraim
for
i
was
gradually
arriving
at
the
conviction
that
my
little
colored
damsel
was
by
no
means
so
simple
and
unsophisticated
as
she
would
have
me
believe
and
that
i
was
after
all
the
one
who
was
imposed
upon
the
snow
this
winter
was
prodigious
and
the
cold
intense
the
water
would
freeze
in
our
parlors
at
a
very
short
distance
from
the
fire
for
although
the
kept
the
halls
filled
with
wood
almost
up
to
the
ceiling
that
did
not
counterbalance
the
inconvenience
of
having
the
wide
doors
thrown
open
to
the
outer
air
for
a
great
portion
of
the
day
to
allow
of
their
bringing
it
in
we
northerners
should
have
had
specially
for
the
purpose
and
not
only
have
kept
our
great
closed
but
have
likewise
protected
them
with
a
but
the
florida
frontier
was
not
a
climate
in
which
our
southern
bachelors
could
have
acquired
the
knowledge
available
when
the
thermometer
was
degrees
below
zero
a
point
at
which
brandy
congealed
in
the
sideboard
the
arrival
of
christmas
and
brought
us
our
indian
friends
again
they
had
learned
something
of
the
observance
of
these
holidays
from
their
french
neighbors
and
i
had
been
forewarned
that
i
should
see
the
squaws
kissing
every
white
man
they
met
although
not
crediting
this
to
its
full
extent
i
could
readily
believe
that
they
would
each
expect
a
present
as
a
compliment
of
the
season
so
i
duly
prepared
myself
with
a
supply
of
beads
ribbons
combs
and
other
trinkets
knowing
them
to
be
fond
of
dainties
i
had
also
a
quantity
of
crullers
and
doughnuts
made
ready
the
day
before
as
a
treat
to
them
to
my
great
surprise
and
annoyance
only
a
moderate
share
of
the
cakes
the
frying
of
which
had
been
intrusted
to
louisa
were
brought
up
to
be
placed
in
the
davis
where
are
the
rest
of
the
cakes
louisa
that
great
fellow
hancock
came
in
with
the
to
fill
the
and
while
i
had
just
stepped
into
the
to
get
some
more
flour
he
carried
off
all
i
had
got
cooked
and
louisa
made
a
face
and
whined
as
if
she
had
not
herself
treated
every
soldier
who
had
set
his
foot
in
the
premises
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
i
had
quite
a
levee
of
the
matrons
they
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
and
i
was
sorry
to
observe
that
the
application
of
a
little
soap
and
water
to
their
blankets
had
formed
no
part
of
their
holiday
preparations
there
being
no
one
to
interpret
i
thought
i
would
begin
the
conversation
in
a
way
intelligible
to
themselves
so
i
brought
out
of
the
sideboard
a
china
dish
filled
with
the
nice
brown
crullers
over
which
i
had
grated
according
to
custom
a
goodly
quantity
of
white
sugar
i
handed
it
to
the
first
of
the
circle
she
took
the
dish
from
my
hand
and
deliberately
pouring
all
the
cakes
into
the
corner
of
her
blanket
returned
it
to
me
empty
she
must
be
a
meat
voracious
person
thought
i
but
i
will
manage
better
the
next
time
i
refilled
the
dish
and
approached
the
next
one
taking
care
to
keep
a
fast
hold
of
it
as
i
offered
the
contents
of
which
i
supposed
she
would
modestly
take
one
not
so
however
she
scooped
out
the
whole
with
her
two
hands
and
like
the
former
bestowed
them
in
her
blanket
my
sense
of
politeness
revolted
at
handing
them
out
one
by
one
as
we
do
to
children
so
i
sat
down
to
deliberate
what
was
to
be
done
for
evidently
the
supply
would
not
long
answer
such
an
ample
demand
and
there
would
be
more
visitors
anon
while
i
was
thus
perplexed
those
who
had
received
the
cakes
commenced
a
distribution
and
the
whole
number
was
equitably
divided
among
the
company
but
i
observed
they
did
not
eat
them
they
passed
their
fingers
over
the
grated
sugar
looked
in
each
other
faces
and
muttered
in
low
tones
there
was
evidently
something
they
did
not
understand
presently
one
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
wet
her
fingers
and
taking
up
a
few
grains
of
the
sugar
put
it
cautiously
to
her
mouth
sugar
was
her
delighted
exclamation
and
they
all
broke
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
cakes
disappeared
with
all
the
celerity
they
deemed
compatible
with
never
having
seen
any
sugar
but
the
brown
or
yellow
maple
they
had
supposed
the
white
substance
to
be
salt
and
for
that
reason
had
hesitated
to
taste
it
their
visit
was
prolonged
until
made
his
appearance
and
then
having
been
made
happy
by
their
various
gifts
they
all
took
their
departure
about
this
time
kinzie
received
a
letter
from
colonel
richard
johnson
of
kentucky
this
gentleman
had
interested
himself
greatly
in
a
school
established
in
that
state
for
the
education
of
indian
youths
and
children
the
purport
of
his
letter
was
to
request
the
agent
to
use
every
endeavor
to
induce
the
winnebagoes
not
only
to
send
their
children
to
this
institution
for
their
education
but
also
what
was
still
more
important
to
set
apart
a
portion
of
their
to
assist
in
sustaining
it
there
happened
to
be
at
this
holiday
season
a
number
of
the
chiefs
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
portage
and
a
messenger
was
sent
to
convene
them
all
at
the
house
of
paquette
the
interpreter
that
their
father
might
hold
a
talk
with
them
on
the
day
appointed
they
all
assembled
the
of
the
letter
was
laid
before
them
and
all
the
advantages
of
civilization
and
education
duly
set
forth
the
benefits
which
would
arise
to
their
nation
if
even
a
small
portion
of
the
younger
members
could
be
well
taught
by
the
whites
and
then
return
to
their
tribe
to
instruct
them
in
the
learning
the
arts
manufactures
and
habits
of
civilized
life
to
each
paragraph
as
it
was
uttered
to
them
they
responded
with
a
unanimous
humph
good
when
their
father
address
was
ended
the
oldest
and
most
venerable
among
the
chiefs
rose
and
spoke
as
follows
father
the
great
spirit
made
the
white
man
and
the
indian
he
did
not
make
them
alike
he
gave
the
white
man
a
heart
to
love
peace
and
the
arts
of
a
quiet
life
he
taught
him
to
live
in
towns
to
build
houses
to
make
books
to
learn
all
things
that
would
make
him
happy
and
prosperous
in
the
way
of
life
appointed
him
to
the
red
man
the
great
spirit
gave
a
different
character
he
gave
him
a
love
of
the
woods
of
a
free
life
of
hunting
and
fishing
of
making
war
with
his
enemies
and
taking
scalps
the
white
man
does
not
live
like
the
indian
it
is
not
his
nature
neither
does
the
indian
love
to
live
like
the
white
man
the
great
spirit
did
not
make
him
so
father
we
do
not
wish
to
do
anything
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
great
spirit
if
he
had
made
us
with
white
skins
and
characters
like
the
white
men
then
we
would
send
our
children
to
this
school
to
be
taught
like
the
white
children
father
we
think
that
if
the
great
spirit
had
wished
us
to
be
like
the
whites
he
would
have
made
us
so
as
he
has
not
seen
fit
to
do
so
we
believe
he
would
be
displeased
with
us
to
try
and
make
ourselves
different
from
what
he
thought
good
father
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
this
is
what
we
think
if
we
change
our
minds
we
will
let
you
know
it
will
be
seen
from
these
remarks
of
that
the
indians
entertain
a
conviction
that
the
great
spirit
himself
teaches
the
white
man
the
arts
and
sciences
and
since
he
has
given
the
red
man
no
instruction
in
these
branches
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
him
to
attempt
to
acquire
them
in
an
irregular
manner
with
little
incidents
of
this
kind
and
with
an
occasional
or
to
the
young
officers
sometimes
given
at
the
quarters
sometimes
at
our
own
our
course
of
life
passed
pleasantly
on
at
times
i
would
amuse
myself
by
making
something
in
the
form
of
a
fruit
cake
or
pie
to
send
to
the
quarters
of
the
young
officers
as
a
present
it
being
supposed
that
possibly
without
a
lady
to
preside
over
their
mess
it
might
be
sometimes
deficient
in
these
delicacies
twiggs
was
so
fortunate
as
to
have
servants
to
do
for
her
that
which
thanks
to
my
little
dark
handmaid
always
fell
to
my
share
one
day
i
had
made
some
mince
pies
which
the
major
and
my
husband
greatly
approved
and
i
thought
i
would
send
one
to
each
of
the
young
officers
it
happened
that
my
husband
that
day
in
returning
from
superintending
his
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
had
occasion
to
call
on
some
errand
at
captain
harney
quarters
dinner
had
just
been
placed
upon
the
table
and
the
captain
insisted
on
his
visitor
sitting
down
and
partaking
with
him
and
another
gentleman
who
was
present
the
pork
and
beans
were
pronounced
excellent
and
being
removed
there
followed
a
mince
pie
the
captain
cut
it
and
helped
his
guests
then
taking
a
piece
himself
he
commenced
tasting
it
pushing
back
his
plate
with
an
exclamation
and
a
sudden
jerk
he
called
to
his
servant
a
little
mulatto
who
waited
david
you
yellow
rascal
how
dare
you
put
such
a
pie
on
my
table
and
turning
to
the
company
apologetically
he
said
if
there
is
anything
on
earth
david
understand
it
is
how
to
make
a
mince
pie
and
here
he
has
filled
this
with
brandy
so
we
can
not
eat
a
morsel
of
it
please
sir
said
david
modestly
i
did
not
make
the
pie
it
is
one
kinzie
sent
as
a
present
the
poor
captain
was
now
in
a
predicament
he
raved
at
himself
at
the
same
time
conjuring
my
husband
most
earnestly
not
to
tell
me
what
a
mistake
he
had
made
an
injunction
that
was
lost
sight
of
as
soon
as
the
latter
returned
to
his
home
as
for
the
unlucky
captain
he
did
not
venture
to
call
on
me
again
until
he
felt
sure
i
had
forgotten
the
circumstance
chapter
xii
preparations
for
a
journey
early
in
january
the
snow
fell
in
great
abundance
we
had
an
unusual
quantity
at
the
portage
but
in
the
diggings
as
the
country
was
called
it
was
of
an
depth
five
or
six
feet
upon
a
level
an
express
had
been
dispatched
to
chicago
by
the
officers
to
take
our
letters
and
bring
back
the
mail
from
that
place
a
tough
hardy
soldier
named
sulky
acted
as
messenger
and
he
had
hitherto
made
light
of
his
burden
or
the
length
of
the
way
notwithstanding
that
his
task
was
performed
on
foot
with
his
pack
upon
his
shoulders
but
now
sulky
had
been
absent
some
weeks
and
we
had
given
him
up
entirely
persuaded
that
he
must
have
perished
with
cold
and
starvation
at
length
he
appeared
nearly
blind
from
travelling
in
the
snow
he
had
lain
by
three
weeks
in
an
indian
lodge
the
snow
being
too
deep
to
permit
him
to
journey
the
account
he
gave
put
an
end
to
the
hopes
i
had
begun
to
entertain
of
being
able
to
visit
our
friends
at
chicago
in
the
course
of
this
winter
we
had
before
the
last
heavy
fall
of
snow
been
forming
plans
to
that
effect
captain
harney
had
kindly
commenced
preparing
some
trains
or
boxes
placed
on
sledges
which
it
was
thought
would
when
lined
with
furnish
a
very
comfortable
kind
of
vehicle
for
the
journey
and
i
was
still
inclined
to
think
a
good
deep
bed
of
snow
over
the
whole
country
no
great
obstacle
to
a
the
whole
matter
was
however
cut
short
by
the
commanding
officer
who
from
the
first
had
violently
opposed
the
scheme
declaring
that
he
would
order
the
sentinels
to
fire
on
us
if
we
attempted
to
leave
the
fort
so
finding
the
majority
against
us
we
were
obliged
to
yield
the
arrival
of
sweet
lovely
little
lizzie
twiggs
before
january
was
quite
past
was
an
event
that
shed
light
and
joy
in
at
least
two
dwellings
it
seemed
as
if
she
belonged
to
all
of
us
and
as
she
increased
in
size
and
beauty
it
was
hard
to
say
who
among
us
all
was
most
proud
of
her
if
we
had
ever
felt
any
languid
hours
before
we
could
have
none
now
she
was
the
pet
the
darling
the
joint
property
of
both
households
whatever
regret
i
might
have
had
previous
to
this
event
at
the
idea
of
leaving
my
friend
for
the
three
weeks
to
which
we
proposed
to
limit
our
visit
to
chicago
i
felt
now
that
she
would
scarcely
miss
me
and
that
we
might
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
improvement
in
the
weather
to
put
this
favorite
project
in
execution
during
the
latter
part
of
february
the
cold
became
less
severe
the
snows
melted
away
and
by
the
beginning
of
march
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
genial
that
we
were
quite
confident
of
being
able
to
make
the
journey
on
horseback
without
any
serious
difficulty
our
plans
once
settled
upon
the
first
thing
to
be
provided
was
warm
and
comfortable
apparel
a
of
stout
broadcloth
was
pronounced
indispensable
to
my
equipment
but
of
such
an
article
i
was
destitute
nothing
among
my
wedding
travelling
gear
seemed
in
any
way
to
offer
a
substitute
what
was
to
be
done
the
requisite
material
was
to
be
found
in
abundance
at
the
sutler
store
as
it
was
technically
termed
but
how
to
get
it
manufactured
into
a
suitable
garment
was
the
question
the
regimental
tailor
was
summoned
he
was
cook
to
one
of
the
companies
and
there
were
at
first
some
doubts
whether
he
could
be
permitted
to
forsake
the
spit
for
the
needle
during
the
time
i
should
require
his
services
all
his
had
heretofore
been
done
at
odd
times
on
a
bench
in
the
company
kitchen
and
thither
he
now
proposed
to
carry
the
i
suggested
that
in
order
to
superintend
the
work
i
should
thus
be
driven
to
take
up
my
abode
for
the
time
being
in
the
barracks
which
would
be
a
decided
inconvenience
to
remedy
the
difficulty
he
was
finally
so
happy
as
to
find
a
soldier
in
company
d
who
consented
to
officiate
in
his
place
as
cook
until
his
term
of
service
to
me
should
expire
behold
then
a
little
man
in
his
seated
on
an
indian
mat
by
my
parlor
window
he
had
made
all
his
arrangements
himself
and
i
deemed
it
wisest
not
to
interfere
with
him
the
was
the
most
difficult
part
and
as
he
had
never
made
a
lady
that
task
fell
to
my
share
i
was
as
great
a
novice
as
himself
and
i
must
admit
that
this
my
first
effort
was
open
to
criticism
but
the
little
tailor
was
of
a
different
opinion
he
was
in
an
ecstasy
with
our
joint
performance
upon
my
word
madam
he
would
exclaim
surveying
it
with
admiring
eyes
we
shall
have
a
very
respectable
garment
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
he
repeated
this
during
the
three
days
that
the
work
was
in
progress
i
believe
he
had
not
perfect
confidence
in
the
culinary
powers
of
his
comrade
of
company
d
for
regularly
a
before
beat
of
drum
his
work
was
folded
and
laid
aside
his
snips
gathered
up
and
all
things
being
restored
to
order
he
would
slip
out
resume
his
shoes
which
he
had
left
outside
the
door
and
speed
over
to
the
to
see
how
matters
were
going
on
in
the
mean
time
great
preparations
were
making
below
under
the
supervision
of
our
tidy
active
little
french
servant
pillon
the
wife
of
one
of
the
by
whom
the
irregular
and
unmanageable
louisa
had
been
replaced
biscuits
were
baked
a
ham
some
tongues
and
sundry
pieces
of
salt
pork
were
boiled
coffee
roasted
and
ground
sugar
cracked
isinglass
cut
in
pieces
of
the
size
requisite
for
a
pot
of
coffee
for
the
reception
of
all
these
different
articles
cotton
bags
of
different
sizes
had
been
previously
prepared
large
sacks
of
skin
called
by
the
canadians
were
also
provided
to
hold
the
more
bulky
provisions
for
our
journey
was
to
be
a
long
one
the
distance
from
fort
winnebago
to
chicago
was
not
very
formidable
it
is
true
if
the
direct
route
were
taken
but
that
we
knew
to
be
impossible
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
route
by
was
out
of
the
question
all
the
indians
being
absent
from
their
villages
in
the
winter
and
the
ice
being
now
gone
we
could
have
no
means
of
crossing
the
rock
river
at
that
place
there
remained
therefore
no
alternative
but
to
proceed
south
to
dixon
or
as
it
was
then
called
ogie
ferry
the
only
certain
means
of
crossing
this
broad
and
rapid
stream
this
route
being
so
much
out
of
our
direct
course
that
we
could
not
hope
to
accomplish
it
in
less
than
six
days
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
accordingly
while
the
wardrobe
and
provisions
were
thus
in
preparation
arrangements
were
also
being
made
as
to
our
retinue
and
mode
of
conveyance
kinzie
decided
to
take
with
him
but
two
men
plante
and
pierre
roy
the
former
to
act
as
guide
on
the
assurance
that
he
knew
every
mile
of
the
way
from
the
portage
to
ogie
ferry
and
from
ogie
ferry
to
chicago
the
claims
of
the
different
were
discussed
and
the
most
eligible
one
was
selected
for
my
use
we
hesitated
for
a
time
between
le
gris
and
souris
two
animals
belonging
to
paquette
the
interpreter
at
length
being
determined
like
most
of
my
sex
by
a
regard
for
exterior
i
chose
le
gris
and
souris
was
assigned
to
young
roy
my
own
little
stumpy
pony
brunet
being
pronounced
just
the
thing
for
a
my
husband
rode
his
own
bay
horse
tom
while
plante
the
gayest
and
proudest
of
the
party
bestrode
a
fine
large
animal
called
jerry
which
had
lately
been
purchased
for
my
use
and
thus
was
our
complete
chapter
xiii
departure
from
fort
winnebago
having
taken
a
tender
leave
of
our
friends
the
morning
of
the
of
march
saw
us
mounted
and
equipped
for
our
journey
the
weather
was
fine
the
streams
already
fringed
with
green
were
sparkling
in
the
sun
everything
gave
promise
of
an
early
and
genial
season
in
vain
when
we
reached
the
ferry
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
the
fort
stood
did
major
twiggs
repeat
his
endeavors
to
dissuade
us
from
commencing
a
journey
which
he
assured
me
would
be
perilous
beyond
what
i
could
anticipate
i
was
resolute
our
party
was
augmented
by
an
escort
of
all
the
young
officers
who
politely
insisted
on
accompanying
us
as
far
as
duck
creek
four
miles
distant
indeed
there
were
some
who
would
gladly
have
prosecuted
the
whole
journey
with
us
and
escaped
the
monotony
of
their
solitary
uneventful
life
in
our
rear
followed
an
ox
cart
on
which
was
perched
a
canoe
destined
to
transport
us
over
the
creek
and
also
an
extensive
marsh
beyond
it
which
was
invariably
at
this
season
overflowed
with
water
to
a
considerable
depth
we
had
much
amusement
in
watching
the
progress
of
this
vehicle
as
it
bumped
and
thumped
over
the
road
unconscious
hitherto
of
the
dignity
of
a
wheeled
carriage
our
little
sunburnt
canadian
who
happened
most
miraculously
to
be
the
husband
of
my
pretty
servant
pillon
shouted
vociferously
as
the
animals
lagged
in
their
pace
or
jolted
against
a
stump
to
our
infinite
diversion
i
was
in
high
spirits
foreseeing
no
hardships
or
dangers
but
rather
imagining
myself
embarked
on
a
pleasure
excursion
across
the
prairies
it
had
not
even
suggested
itself
to
me
that
a
straw
bonnet
and
kid
gloves
were
no
suitable
equipment
for
such
an
expedition
never
having
travelled
at
so
inclement
a
season
i
was
heedlessly
ignorant
of
the
mode
of
preparing
against
it
and
had
resisted
or
laughed
at
my
husband
suggestions
to
provide
myself
with
blanket
socks
and
a
woollen
for
my
head
and
shoulders
and
now
although
the
wind
occasionally
lifted
my
with
a
rude
puff
and
my
hands
ere
long
became
swollen
and
stiffened
with
the
cold
i
persuaded
myself
that
these
were
trifling
evils
to
which
i
should
soon
get
accustomed
i
was
too
well
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
my
outfit
with
my
in
a
gay
scabbard
hanging
from
my
neck
and
my
tin
cup
at
my
to
regard
minor
inconveniences
on
reaching
duck
creek
we
took
leave
of
our
young
friends
who
remained
on
the
bank
long
enough
to
witness
our
passage
across
ourselves
in
the
canoe
and
the
poor
horses
swimming
the
stream
now
filled
with
cakes
of
floating
ice
beyond
the
rising
ground
which
formed
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
extended
a
marsh
of
perhaps
three
hundred
yards
across
to
this
the
men
carried
the
canoe
which
was
to
bear
us
over
the
water
was
not
deep
so
our
attendants
merely
took
off
the
pack
from
brunet
and
my
from
le
gris
for
fear
of
accidents
and
then
mounted
their
own
steeds
leading
the
two
extra
ones
my
husband
placed
the
furniture
of
the
and
my
saddle
in
the
centre
of
the
canoe
which
he
was
to
paddle
across
now
wifie
said
he
jump
in
and
seat
yourself
flat
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
oh
no
said
i
i
will
sit
on
the
little
trunk
in
the
centre
i
shall
be
so
much
more
comfortable
and
i
can
balance
the
canoe
exactly
as
you
please
but
i
think
you
will
find
it
is
not
the
best
way
a
vigorous
push
sent
us
a
few
feet
from
the
bank
at
that
instant
two
favorite
greyhounds
whom
we
had
brought
with
us
and
who
had
stood
whining
upon
the
bank
reluctant
to
take
to
the
water
as
they
were
ordered
gave
a
sudden
bound
and
alighted
full
upon
me
the
canoe
balanced
a
moment
then
yielded
and
quick
as
thought
dogs
furniture
and
lady
were
in
the
deepest
of
the
water
my
husband
who
was
just
preparing
to
spring
into
the
canoe
when
the
dogs
thus
unceremoniously
took
precedence
of
him
was
at
my
side
in
a
moment
and
seizing
me
by
the
collar
of
my
cloak
begged
me
not
to
be
frightened
i
was
not
in
the
least
and
only
laughed
as
he
raised
and
placed
me
again
upon
the
bank
the
unfortunate
saddle
and
little
trunk
were
then
rescued
but
not
until
they
had
received
a
pretty
thorough
wetting
our
merriment
was
still
further
increased
by
the
sight
of
the
maladroit
pillon
who
was
attempting
to
ride
my
spirited
jerry
across
the
marsh
he
was
clinging
to
the
neck
of
the
animal
with
a
countenance
distorted
with
terror
as
he
shouted
forth
all
manner
of
french
objurgations
jerry
pranced
and
curveted
and
finally
shot
forward
his
rider
or
rather
his
headforemost
a
distance
of
several
feet
into
the
water
a
general
outcry
of
mirth
saluted
the
unfortunate
frenchman
which
was
redoubled
as
he
raised
himself
puffing
and
snorting
from
his
watery
bed
and
waddled
back
to
his
the
horse
meanwhile
very
sensibly
making
his
way
to
join
his
companions
who
had
already
reached
the
farther
bank
well
wifie
said
kinzie
i
can
not
trust
you
in
the
canoe
again
there
is
no
way
but
to
carry
you
across
the
marsh
like
a
pappoose
will
you
take
a
ride
on
my
shoulders
with
all
my
heart
if
you
will
promise
to
take
me
safely
and
i
was
soon
mounted
i
most
confess
that
the
gentleman
staggered
now
and
then
under
his
burden
which
was
no
slight
one
and
i
was
sadly
afraid
more
than
once
that
i
should
meet
a
similar
fate
to
old
pillon
but
happily
we
reached
the
other
side
in
safety
there
my
husband
insisted
on
my
putting
on
dry
shoes
and
stockings
and
must
i
confess
it
drinking
a
little
brandy
to
obviate
the
effects
of
my
icy
bath
he
would
fain
have
made
a
halt
to
kindle
a
fire
and
dry
my
apparel
and
wardrobe
properly
but
this
i
would
not
listen
to
i
endeavored
to
prove
to
him
that
the
delay
would
expose
me
to
more
cold
than
riding
in
my
wet
habit
and
cloak
and
so
indeed
it
might
have
been
but
along
with
my
convictions
upon
the
subject
there
was
mingled
a
spice
of
reluctance
that
our
friends
at
the
fort
should
have
an
opportunity
as
they
certainly
would
have
done
of
laughing
at
our
inauspicious
commencement
soon
our
horses
were
put
in
order
and
our
march
recommenced
the
day
was
fine
for
the
season
i
felt
no
inconvenience
from
my
wet
garments
the
exercise
of
riding
taking
away
all
feeling
of
chilliness
it
was
to
me
a
new
mode
of
travelling
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
more
from
having
been
secluded
for
more
than
five
months
within
the
walls
of
the
fort
scarcely
varying
the
tenor
of
our
lives
by
an
occasional
walk
of
half
a
mile
into
the
surrounding
woods
we
had
still
another
detention
upon
the
road
from
meeting
lapierre
the
blacksmith
from
sugar
creek
who
with
one
of
his
associates
was
going
to
the
portage
for
supplies
so
that
we
had
not
travelled
more
than
miles
when
we
came
to
our
proposed
it
was
upon
a
beautiful
stream
a
tributary
of
one
of
the
four
lakes
that
chain
whose
banks
are
unrivalled
for
romantic
loveliness
i
could
not
but
admire
the
sagacity
of
the
horses
who
seemed
with
human
intelligence
to
divine
our
approach
to
the
spot
where
their
toils
were
to
cease
while
still
remote
from
the
point
of
woods
which
foretold
a
halt
they
pricked
up
their
ears
accelerated
their
pace
and
finally
arrived
at
the
spot
on
a
full
gallop
we
alighted
at
an
open
space
just
within
the
verge
of
the
wood
or
as
it
is
called
by
western
travellers
the
timber
my
husband
recommended
to
me
to
walk
about
until
a
fire
should
be
made
which
was
soon
accomplished
by
our
active
and
experienced
woodsmen
to
whom
the
felling
of
a
large
tree
was
the
work
of
a
very
few
minutes
the
dry
grass
around
furnished
an
excellent
tinder
which
ignited
by
the
sparks
from
the
flint
there
were
no
in
those
days
and
aided
by
the
broken
branches
and
bits
of
soon
produced
a
cheering
flame
the
bourgeois
in
the
mean
time
busied
himself
in
setting
up
the
tent
taking
care
to
place
it
opposite
the
fire
but
in
such
a
direction
that
the
wind
would
carry
the
smoke
and
flame
away
from
the
opening
or
door
within
upon
the
ground
were
spread
first
a
then
two
or
three
blankets
of
which
each
equestrian
had
carried
two
one
under
the
saddle
and
one
above
it
after
which
the
remainder
of
the
luggage
being
brought
in
i
was
able
to
divest
myself
of
all
my
wet
clothing
and
replace
it
with
dry
some
idea
of
the
state
of
the
thermometer
may
be
formed
from
the
fact
that
my
being
placed
over
the
end
of
the
huge
log
against
which
our
fire
was
made
was
in
a
very
few
minutes
frozen
so
stiff
as
to
stand
upright
giving
the
appearance
of
a
dress
out
of
which
a
lady
had
vanished
in
some
unaccountable
manner
it
would
be
but
a
repetition
of
our
experience
upon
the
fox
river
to
describe
the
ham
broiled
upon
the
broches
the
toasted
bread
the
steaming
coffee
the
primitive
there
is
however
this
difference
that
of
the
latter
we
carry
with
us
in
our
journeys
on
horseback
only
a
a
and
each
rider
his
tin
cup
and
the
deportment
at
table
is
marked
by
an
absence
of
ceremony
the
knife
is
drawn
from
the
scabbard
those
who
remember
to
do
so
vouchsafe
it
a
wipe
upon
the
napkin
its
first
office
is
to
stir
the
cup
of
coffee
next
to
divide
the
piece
of
ham
which
is
placed
on
the
half
of
a
travelling
biscuit
held
in
the
left
hand
to
fulfil
the
office
of
a
plate
it
is
an
art
only
to
be
acquired
by
long
practice
to
cut
the
meat
so
skilfully
as
not
at
the
same
time
to
destroy
the
dish
we
take
our
places
around
the
mat
to
enjoy
what
after
our
fatiguing
ride
we
find
delicious
food
the
frenchmen
are
seated
at
a
little
distance
receiving
their
supplies
of
coffee
meat
and
bread
and
occasionally
passing
jokes
with
the
bourgeois
who
is
their
and
for
whom
their
respect
and
devotion
are
never
lessened
by
his
affability
or
condescension
the
meal
being
finished
the
is
rinsed
in
hot
water
and
set
aside
until
morning
a
wisp
of
dry
is
supposed
in
most
cases
to
render
the
knife
fit
to
be
restored
to
the
scabbard
and
there
being
at
this
season
of
the
year
no
amusement
but
that
of
watching
the
awkward
movements
of
the
spancelled
horses
in
their
progress
from
spot
to
spot
in
search
of
pasturage
we
are
usually
soon
disposed
to
arrange
our
blankets
and
retire
to
rest
at
break
of
day
we
are
aroused
by
the
shout
of
the
bourgeois
how
how
how
all
start
from
their
slumbers
the
fire
which
has
been
occasionally
replenished
through
the
night
is
soon
kindled
into
a
flame
the
horses
are
caught
and
saddled
while
a
breakfast
similar
in
kind
to
the
meal
of
the
preceding
evening
is
preparing
the
tent
is
struck
the
loaded
as
the
canadian
says
the
breakfast
finished
we
rinse
our
kettles
and
cups
tie
them
to
our
and
then
mount
and
away
leaving
our
fire
or
rather
our
smoke
to
tell
of
our
visit
march
our
journey
this
day
led
us
past
the
first
of
the
four
lakes
scattered
along
its
banks
was
an
encampment
of
winnebagoes
they
greeted
their
father
with
vociferous
joy
how
do
you
do
to
this
succeeded
the
usual
announcement
i
have
no
bread
this
is
their
form
of
begging
but
we
could
not
afford
to
be
generous
for
the
uncertainty
of
obtaining
a
supply
should
our
own
be
exhausted
obliged
us
to
observe
the
strictest
economy
how
beautiful
the
entrapment
looked
in
the
morning
sun
the
matted
lodges
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
from
their
tops
the
trees
and
bushes
powdered
with
a
light
snow
which
had
fallen
through
the
night
the
lake
shining
and
sparkling
almost
at
our
feet
even
the
indians
in
their
peculiar
costume
adding
to
the
picturesque
i
was
sorry
to
leave
it
as
we
were
compelled
to
do
in
all
haste
souris
the
having
taken
it
into
his
head
to
decamp
while
we
were
in
conversation
with
our
red
friends
as
he
had
very
sensibly
concluded
to
pursue
his
journey
in
the
right
direction
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
overtake
him
after
a
short
race
and
having
received
much
scolding
and
some
blows
from
young
roy
whose
charge
he
specially
was
he
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
cavalcade
as
a
mark
of
disgrace
for
his
breach
of
duty
our
road
after
leaving
the
lake
lay
over
a
rolling
prairie
now
bare
and
desolate
enough
the
hollows
were
filled
with
snow
which
being
partly
thawed
furnished
an
uncertain
footing
for
the
horses
and
i
could
not
but
join
in
the
ringing
laughter
of
oar
frenchmen
as
occasionally
brunet
and
souris
the
two
ponies
would
flounder
almost
imbedded
through
the
yielding
mass
even
the
vainglorious
plante
who
piqued
himself
on
his
equestrian
skill
was
once
or
twice
nearly
unhorsed
from
having
chosen
his
road
badly
sometimes
the
elevations
were
covered
with
a
thicket
or
copse
in
which
our
dogs
would
generally
rouse
up
one
or
more
deer
their
first
bound
or
lope
was
the
signal
for
a
chase
the
horses
seemed
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
as
halloo
answered
halloo
but
we
were
never
so
fortunate
as
to
get
a
shot
at
one
for
although
the
dogs
once
or
twice
caught
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
hold
them
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
we
reached
the
blue
mound
i
rejoiced
much
to
have
got
so
far
for
i
was
sadly
fatigued
and
every
mile
now
seemed
like
two
to
me
in
fact
the
miles
are
unconscionably
long
in
this
country
when
i
was
told
that
we
had
still
seven
miles
to
go
to
morrison
where
we
proposed
stopping
for
the
night
i
was
almost
in
despair
it
was
my
first
journey
on
horseback
and
i
had
not
yet
become
inured
to
the
exercise
when
we
reached
morrison
i
was
so
much
exhausted
that
as
my
husband
attempted
to
lift
me
from
the
saddle
i
fell
into
his
arms
this
will
never
do
said
he
we
must
turn
our
faces
towards
fort
winnebago
again
the
door
opened
hospitably
to
receive
us
we
were
welcomed
by
a
lady
with
a
most
sweet
benignant
countenance
and
by
her
companion
some
years
younger
the
first
was
morrison
the
other
miss
elizabeth
dodge
daughter
of
general
dodge
my
husband
laid
me
upon
a
small
bed
in
the
room
where
the
ladies
had
been
sitting
at
work
they
took
off
my
bonnet
and
chafed
my
hands
and
prepared
me
some
warm
wine
and
water
by
which
i
was
soon
revived
a
repose
so
refreshed
me
that
i
was
able
to
converse
with
the
ladies
and
to
relieve
my
husband
mind
of
all
anxiety
on
my
account
tea
was
announced
soon
after
and
we
repaired
to
an
adjoining
building
for
morrison
like
the
establishment
of
all
settlers
of
that
period
consisted
of
a
group
of
detached
log
houses
or
each
containing
one
or
at
most
two
apartments
the
table
groaned
with
good
cheer
and
brought
to
mind
some
that
i
had
seen
among
the
dutch
residents
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
i
had
recovered
my
spirits
and
we
were
quite
a
cheerful
party
morrison
told
us
that
during
the
first
eighteen
months
she
passed
in
this
country
she
did
not
speak
with
a
white
woman
the
only
society
she
had
being
that
of
her
husband
and
two
black
a
tennessee
woman
had
called
in
with
her
little
son
just
before
tea
and
we
amused
kinzie
with
a
description
of
the
pair
the
visit
was
simply
one
of
courtesy
she
was
a
little
dumpy
woman
with
a
complexion
burned
perfectly
red
by
the
sun
and
hair
of
an
exact
braided
up
from
her
forehead
in
front
and
from
her
neck
behind
these
tails
meeting
on
the
top
of
her
head
were
fastened
with
a
small
tin
comb
her
dress
was
of
checkered
homespun
a
very
tight
fit
and
as
she
wore
no
ruff
or
handkerchief
around
her
neck
she
looked
as
if
just
prepared
for
execution
she
was
evidently
awestruck
at
the
sight
of
visitors
and
seemed
inclined
to
take
her
departure
at
once
but
the
boy
not
so
easily
intimidated
would
not
understand
her
signs
and
pinches
until
he
had
sidled
up
to
morrison
and
drawing
his
old
hat
still
farther
over
his
eyes
begged
for
a
meaning
a
narrow
strip
of
the
lady
very
obligingly
cut
one
from
a
large
smoked
skin
which
she
produced
from
its
receptacle
and
mother
and
son
took
their
leave
with
a
smiling
but
rather
a
scared
look
after
tea
we
returned
to
morrison
parlor
where
she
kindly
insisted
on
my
again
reposing
myself
on
the
little
bed
to
recruit
me
as
she
said
for
the
ensuing
day
journey
my
husband
in
the
mean
time
went
to
look
after
the
accommodation
of
his
men
and
horses
during
the
conversation
that
ensued
i
learned
that
morrison
had
passed
much
time
in
the
neighborhood
of
my
recent
home
in
oneida
county
that
many
of
the
friends
i
had
loved
and
valued
were
likewise
her
friends
and
that
she
had
even
proposed
to
visit
me
at
fort
winnebago
on
hearing
of
my
arrival
there
in
order
to
commence
an
acquaintance
which
had
thus
been
brought
about
by
other
and
unexpected
means
long
and
pleasant
was
the
discourse
we
held
together
until
a
late
hour
and
mutual
was
the
satisfaction
with
which
we
passed
old
friends
and
events
in
review
much
to
the
edification
of
miss
dodge
and
of
the
gentlemen
when
they
once
more
joined
us
chapter
xiv
william
hamilton
kellogg
grove
the
next
morning
after
a
cheerful
breakfast
at
which
we
were
joined
by
the
rev
kent
of
galena
we
prepared
for
our
journey
i
had
reconciled
my
husband
to
continuing
our
route
towards
chicago
by
assuring
him
that
i
felt
as
fresh
and
bright
as
when
i
first
set
out
from
home
there
seemed
some
apprehension
however
that
we
might
have
difficulty
in
striking
the
trail
to
hamilton
our
next
point
of
destination
the
directions
we
received
were
certainly
obscure
we
were
to
pursue
a
given
trail
for
a
certain
number
of
miles
when
we
should
come
to
a
crossing
into
which
we
were
to
turn
taking
an
easterly
direction
after
a
time
this
would
bring
us
to
a
deep
trail
leading
straight
to
hamilton
in
this
open
country
there
are
no
landmarks
one
elevation
is
so
exactly
like
another
that
if
you
lose
your
trail
there
is
almost
as
little
hope
of
regaining
it
as
of
finding
a
pathway
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
the
trail
it
must
be
remembered
is
not
a
broad
highway
but
a
narrow
path
deeply
indented
by
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
on
which
the
indians
travel
in
single
file
so
deeply
is
it
sunk
in
the
sod
which
covers
the
prairies
that
it
is
difficult
sometimes
to
distinguish
it
at
a
distance
of
a
few
rods
it
was
new
ground
to
kinzie
whose
journeys
from
the
portage
to
chicago
had
hitherto
been
made
in
the
direct
route
by
he
therefore
obliged
morrison
to
repeat
the
directions
again
and
again
though
plante
our
guide
swaggered
and
talked
big
averring
that
he
knew
every
hill
and
stream
and
point
of
woods
from
that
spot
to
chicago
we
had
not
proceeded
many
miles
on
our
journey
however
before
we
discovered
that
monsieur
plante
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
country
so
that
kinzie
was
obliged
to
take
the
lead
himself
and
make
his
way
as
he
was
best
able
according
to
the
directions
he
had
received
nothing
however
like
the
cross
trails
we
had
been
promised
met
our
view
and
the
path
on
which
we
had
set
out
diverged
so
much
from
what
we
knew
to
be
the
right
direction
that
we
were
at
length
compelled
to
abandon
it
altogether
we
travelled
the
livelong
day
barely
making
a
halt
at
noon
to
bait
our
horses
and
refresh
ourselves
with
a
luncheon
the
ride
was
as
gloomy
and
desolate
as
could
well
be
imagined
a
rolling
prairie
unvaried
by
forest
or
stream
hillock
rising
after
hillock
at
every
ascent
of
which
we
vainly
hoped
to
see
a
distant
fringe
of
but
the
same
cheerless
unbounded
prospect
everywhere
met
the
eye
diversified
only
here
and
there
by
the
oblong
openings
like
gigantic
graves
which
marked
an
unsuccessful
search
for
indications
of
a
so
great
was
our
anxiety
to
recover
our
trail
for
the
weather
was
growing
more
cold
and
the
wind
more
sharp
and
piercing
that
we
were
not
tempted
to
turn
from
our
course
even
by
the
appearance
more
than
once
of
a
gaunt
peering
over
the
nearest
and
seeming
to
dare
us
to
an
encounter
the
frenchmen
it
is
true
would
instinctively
give
a
shout
and
spur
on
their
horses
while
the
hounds
kelda
and
cora
would
rush
to
the
chase
but
the
bourgeois
soon
called
them
back
with
a
warning
that
we
must
attend
strictly
to
the
prosecution
of
our
journey
just
before
sunset
we
crossed
with
some
difficulty
a
muddy
stream
which
was
bordered
by
a
scanty
belt
of
trees
making
a
tolerable
and
of
this
we
gladly
availed
ourselves
although
we
knew
not
whether
it
was
near
or
remote
from
the
place
we
were
in
search
of
we
had
ridden
at
least
fifty
miles
since
leaving
morrison
yet
i
was
sensible
of
very
little
fatigue
there
was
however
a
vague
feeling
of
discomfort
at
the
idea
of
being
lost
in
this
wild
cold
region
altogether
different
from
anything
i
had
ever
before
experienced
the
encouraging
tones
of
my
husband
voice
however
cheer
up
wifie
we
will
find
the
trail
served
to
dissipate
all
uneasiness
the
exertions
of
the
men
soon
made
our
camp
comfortable
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
driving
the
into
the
frozen
ground
and
the
want
of
trees
sufficiently
large
to
make
a
fire
the
place
was
a
as
it
would
be
called
in
new
england
where
such
things
abound
but
we
were
not
disposed
to
be
fastidious
so
we
ate
our
salt
ham
and
toasted
our
bread
and
lent
a
pleased
ear
to
the
chatter
of
our
frenchmen
who
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
heroism
of
madame
john
amid
the
vicissitudes
that
befell
her
the
wind
which
at
was
sufficiently
high
to
be
uncomfortable
increased
during
the
night
it
snowed
heavily
and
we
were
every
moment
in
dread
that
the
tent
would
be
carried
away
but
the
matter
was
settled
differently
by
the
snapping
of
the
poles
and
the
falling
of
the
whole
with
its
superincumbent
weight
of
snow
in
a
mass
upon
us
kinzie
roused
up
his
men
and
at
their
head
he
sallied
into
the
neighboring
wood
to
cut
a
new
set
of
poles
leaving
me
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
whole
upon
my
shoulders
my
only
safety
from
the
storm
being
to
keep
snugly
housed
beneath
the
canvas
with
some
difficulty
a
sort
of
support
was
at
length
adjusted
for
the
which
answered
our
purpose
tolerably
well
until
the
break
of
day
when
our
damp
and
miserable
condition
made
us
very
glad
to
rise
and
hang
round
the
fire
until
breakfast
was
dispatched
and
the
horses
once
more
saddled
for
our
journey
the
prospect
was
not
an
encouraging
one
around
us
was
an
unbroken
sheet
of
snow
we
had
no
compass
and
the
air
was
so
obscured
by
the
driving
sleet
that
it
was
often
impossible
to
tell
in
which
direction
the
sun
was
i
tied
my
husband
silk
over
my
veil
to
protect
my
face
from
the
wind
and
icy
particles
with
which
the
air
was
filled
and
which
cut
like
a
razor
but
although
shielded
in
every
way
that
circumstances
rendered
possible
i
suffered
intensely
from
the
cold
we
pursued
our
way
mile
after
mile
entering
every
point
of
woods
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
at
least
some
indian
wigwam
at
which
we
could
gain
intelligence
every
spot
was
solitary
and
deserted
not
even
the
trace
of
a
recent
fire
to
cheer
us
with
the
hope
of
human
beings
within
miles
of
us
suddenly
a
shout
from
the
foremost
of
the
party
made
each
heart
bound
with
joy
clôture
une
clôture
a
fence
a
fence
it
was
almost
like
life
to
the
dead
we
spurred
on
and
indeed
perceived
a
few
straggling
rails
crowning
a
rising
ground
at
no
great
distance
never
did
music
sound
so
sweet
as
the
crowing
of
a
cock
which
at
this
moment
saluted
our
ears
following
the
course
of
the
inclosure
down
the
opposite
slope
we
came
upon
a
group
of
log
cabins
low
shabby
and
unpromising
in
their
appearance
but
a
most
welcome
shelter
from
the
pelting
storm
whose
cabins
are
these
asked
kinzie
of
a
man
who
was
cutting
wood
at
the
door
of
one
hamilton
was
his
reply
and
he
stepped
forward
at
once
to
assist
us
to
alight
hospitality
being
a
matter
of
course
in
these
wild
regions
we
were
shown
into
the
most
of
the
buildings
a
large
fire
was
burning
in
the
clay
chimney
and
the
room
was
of
a
genial
warmth
notwithstanding
the
apertures
many
inches
in
width
beside
the
doors
and
windows
a
woman
in
a
tidy
calico
dress
and
shabby
black
silk
cap
trimmed
with
still
shabbier
lace
rose
from
her
seat
beside
a
sort
of
which
fulfilled
the
office
of
cradle
to
a
fine
fat
baby
she
made
room
for
us
at
the
fire
but
was
either
too
timid
or
too
ignorant
to
relieve
me
of
wrappings
and
defences
now
heavy
with
the
snow
i
soon
contrived
with
my
husband
aid
to
disembarrass
myself
of
them
and
having
seen
me
comfortably
disposed
of
and
in
a
fair
way
to
be
thawed
after
my
freezing
ride
he
left
me
to
see
after
his
men
and
horses
he
was
a
long
time
absent
and
i
expected
he
would
return
accompanied
by
our
host
but
when
he
reappeared
it
was
to
tell
me
laughing
that
hamilton
hesitated
to
present
himself
before
me
being
unwilling
that
one
who
had
been
acquainted
with
his
family
at
the
east
should
see
him
in
his
present
mode
of
life
however
this
feeling
apparently
wore
off
for
before
dinner
he
came
in
and
was
introduced
to
me
and
was
as
agreeable
and
polite
as
the
son
of
alexander
hamilton
would
naturally
be
the
housekeeper
who
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
miners
prepared
us
a
plain
comfortable
dinner
and
a
table
as
long
as
the
dimensions
of
the
cabin
would
admit
was
set
out
the
end
nearest
the
fire
being
covered
with
somewhat
nicer
furniture
and
more
delicate
fare
than
the
remaining
portion
the
blowing
of
a
horn
was
the
signal
for
the
entrance
of
ten
or
twelve
miners
who
took
their
places
below
us
at
the
table
they
were
the
set
of
men
i
ever
beheld
and
their
language
was
as
uncouth
as
their
persons
they
wore
trowsers
and
moccasins
of
the
former
being
ornamented
at
the
seams
with
a
fringe
of
the
same
while
a
colored
belt
around
the
waist
in
which
was
stuck
a
large
gave
each
the
appearance
of
a
brigand
hamilton
although
so
much
their
superior
was
addressed
by
them
uniformly
as
uncle
billy
and
i
could
not
but
fancy
there
was
something
desperate
about
them
that
it
was
necessary
to
propitiate
by
this
familiarity
this
feeling
was
further
confirmed
by
the
remarks
of
one
of
the
company
who
lingered
behind
after
the
rest
of
the
had
taken
their
departure
he
had
learned
that
we
came
from
fort
winnebago
and
having
informed
us
that
he
was
a
discharged
soldier
and
would
like
to
make
some
inquiries
about
his
old
station
and
comrades
he
unceremoniously
seated
himself
and
commenced
questioning
us
the
bitterness
with
which
he
spoke
of
his
former
officers
made
me
quite
sure
he
was
a
deserter
and
i
rather
suspected
he
had
made
his
escape
from
the
service
in
consequence
of
some
punishment
his
countenance
was
fairly
distorted
as
he
spoke
of
captain
to
whose
company
he
had
belonged
there
is
a
man
in
the
mines
said
he
who
has
been
in
his
hands
and
if
he
ever
gets
a
chance
to
come
within
shot
of
him
i
guess
the
captain
will
remember
it
he
knows
well
enough
he
dars
set
his
foot
in
the
diggings
and
there
is
not
much
better
everybody
thought
it
a
great
pity
that
fellow
gun
snapped
when
he
so
nearly
him
at
green
bay
having
delivered
himself
of
these
sentiments
he
marched
out
to
my
great
relief
hamilton
passed
most
of
the
afternoon
with
us
for
the
storm
raged
so
without
that
to
proceed
on
our
journey
was
out
of
the
question
he
gave
us
many
pleasant
anecdotes
and
reminiscences
of
his
early
life
in
new
york
and
of
his
adventures
since
he
had
come
to
the
western
wilderness
when
obliged
to
leave
us
for
awhile
he
furnished
us
with
some
books
to
entertain
us
the
most
interesting
of
which
was
the
biography
of
his
father
could
this
illustrious
man
have
foreseen
in
what
a
scene
the
dwelling
of
his
son
this
book
was
to
be
one
day
perused
what
would
have
been
his
sensations
the
most
amusing
part
of
our
experience
was
yet
to
come
i
had
been
speculating
as
evening
approached
on
our
prospects
for
the
accommodation
as
our
pale
landlady
and
her
fat
baby
were
evidently
the
only
specimens
of
the
feminine
gender
about
the
establishment
it
was
hardly
reasonable
to
suppose
that
any
of
the
other
cabins
contained
wherewithal
to
furnish
us
a
comfortable
lodging
and
the
one
in
which
we
were
offered
nothing
of
the
sort
to
view
but
two
beds
uncurtained
extended
against
the
farther
wall
my
doubts
were
after
a
time
resolved
by
observing
the
hostess
stretch
a
cord
between
the
two
on
which
she
hung
some
petticoats
and
extra
garments
by
way
of
a
partition
after
which
she
invited
us
to
occupy
one
of
them
my
only
preparation
was
to
wrap
my
cloak
around
me
and
lie
down
with
my
face
to
the
wall
but
the
good
people
were
less
ceremonious
for
at
the
distance
of
scarcely
two
feet
we
could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
sound
of
their
garments
being
not
laid
aside
but
whipped
over
the
between
us
our
waking
thoughts
however
were
only
those
of
thankfulness
for
so
comfortable
a
lodging
after
the
trials
and
fatigues
we
had
undergone
and
even
these
were
of
short
duration
for
our
eyes
were
soon
closed
in
slumber
the
next
day
sun
rose
clear
and
bright
refreshed
and
invigorated
we
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
a
recommencement
of
our
journey
confident
of
meeting
no
more
mishaps
by
the
way
hamilton
kindly
offered
to
accompany
us
to
his
next
neighbor
the
trifling
distance
of
miles
from
kellogg
to
ogie
ferry
on
the
rock
river
the
road
being
much
travelled
we
should
be
in
no
danger
said
of
again
losing
our
way
the
miner
who
owned
the
wife
and
baby
and
who
consequently
was
somewhat
more
humanized
than
his
comrades
in
taking
leave
of
us
wished
us
well
out
of
the
country
and
that
we
might
never
have
occasion
to
return
to
it
i
pity
a
body
said
he
when
i
see
them
making
such
an
awful
mistake
as
to
come
out
this
way
for
comfort
this
western
country
we
found
hamilton
as
agreeable
a
companion
as
on
the
preceding
day
but
a
most
desperate
rider
he
galloped
on
at
such
a
rate
that
had
i
not
exchanged
my
pony
for
the
fine
noble
jerry
i
should
have
been
in
danger
of
being
left
behind
well
mounted
as
we
all
were
he
sometimes
nearly
distanced
us
we
were
now
among
the
branches
of
the
pickatonick
and
the
country
had
lost
its
prairie
character
and
become
rough
and
broken
we
went
dashing
on
sometimes
down
ravines
sometimes
through
narrow
passes
where
as
i
followed
i
left
fragments
of
my
veil
upon
the
projecting
and
interwoven
branches
once
my
hat
became
entangled
and
had
not
my
husband
sprung
to
my
rescue
i
must
have
shared
the
fate
of
absalom
jerry
ambition
to
keep
his
place
in
the
race
making
it
probable
he
would
do
as
did
the
mule
who
was
under
the
unfortunate
prince
there
was
no
halting
upon
the
route
and
as
we
kept
the
same
pace
until
three
in
the
afternoon
it
was
beyond
a
question
that
when
we
reached
kellogg
we
had
travelled
at
least
thirty
miles
one
of
my
greatest
annoyances
during
the
ride
had
been
the
behavior
of
the
little
beast
brunet
he
had
been
hitherto
used
as
a
and
had
been
accustomed
to
a
station
in
the
file
near
the
guide
or
leader
he
did
not
relish
being
put
in
the
background
as
a
and
accordingly
whenever
we
approached
a
stream
where
the
file
broke
up
to
permit
each
horseman
to
choose
his
own
place
of
fording
it
was
invariably
the
case
that
just
as
i
was
reining
jerry
into
the
water
brunet
would
come
rushing
past
and
throw
himself
into
our
very
footsteps
plunging
snorting
and
splashing
me
with
water
and
sometimes
even
starting
jerry
into
a
leap
aside
he
more
than
once
brought
me
into
imminent
danger
of
being
tossed
into
the
stream
it
was
in
vain
that
after
one
or
two
such
adventures
i
learned
to
hold
back
and
give
the
vexatious
little
animal
the
precedence
his
passion
seemed
to
be
to
go
into
the
water
precisely
at
the
moment
jerry
did
and
i
was
obliged
at
last
to
make
a
bargain
with
young
roy
to
dismount
and
hold
him
at
every
stream
until
i
had
got
safely
across
kellogg
was
a
comfortable
mansion
just
within
the
verge
of
a
pleasant
grove
of
timber
as
a
small
forest
is
called
by
western
travellers
we
found
kellogg
a
very
matron
who
soon
informed
us
she
was
from
the
city
of
new
york
she
appeared
proud
and
delighted
to
entertain
hamilton
for
whose
family
she
took
occasion
to
tell
us
she
had
in
former
days
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
worthy
woman
provided
us
an
excellent
dinner
and
afterwards
installed
me
in
a
beside
a
large
fire
with
the
life
of
fletcher
to
entertain
me
while
the
gentlemen
explored
the
premises
visited
kellogg
stock
and
took
a
careful
look
at
their
own
we
had
intended
to
go
to
dixon
the
same
afternoon
but
the
snow
beginning
again
to
fall
obliged
us
to
content
ourselves
where
we
were
in
the
mean
time
finding
we
were
journeying
to
chicago
kellogg
came
to
the
determination
to
accompany
us
having
as
he
said
some
business
to
accomplish
at
that
place
so
kellogg
busied
herself
in
preparing
him
to
set
off
with
us
the
following
morning
i
pleaded
hard
to
remain
yet
another
day
as
the
following
was
sunday
on
which
i
objected
to
travel
but
in
view
of
the
necessities
of
the
case
the
uncertainty
of
the
weather
and
the
importance
of
getting
as
quickly
as
possible
through
this
wild
country
my
objections
were
overruled
and
i
could
only
obtain
a
delay
in
starting
until
so
late
in
the
afternoon
as
would
give
us
just
time
to
ride
the
sixteen
miles
to
dixon
before
sunset
no
great
time
was
required
for
kellogg
preparations
he
would
take
he
said
only
two
days
provisions
for
at
his
dixon
we
should
get
our
supper
and
breakfast
and
the
route
from
there
to
chicago
could
he
well
knew
be
accomplished
in
a
day
and
a
half
although
according
to
this
calculation
we
had
sufficient
remaining
of
our
stores
to
carry
us
to
the
end
of
our
journey
yet
my
husband
took
the
precaution
of
begging
kellogg
to
bake
us
another
bag
of
biscuits
in
case
of
accidents
and
he
likewise
suggested
to
kellogg
the
prudence
of
furnishing
himself
with
something
more
than
his
limited
allowance
but
the
good
man
objected
that
he
was
unwilling
to
burden
his
horse
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
seeing
that
at
this
season
of
the
year
we
were
obliged
to
carry
fodder
for
the
animals
in
addition
to
the
rest
of
their
load
it
will
be
seen
that
we
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
our
own
foresight
my
experience
of
the
previous
night
had
rendered
me
somewhat
less
fastidious
than
when
i
commenced
my
journey
so
that
when
introduced
to
our
which
i
found
we
were
to
share
with
six
men
travellers
like
ourselves
my
only
feeling
was
one
of
thankfulness
that
each
bed
was
furnished
with
a
full
suit
of
blue
checked
curtains
which
formed
a
very
tolerable
substitute
for
a
chapter
xv
rock
river
hours
of
trouble
it
was
late
on
the
following
day
march
when
we
took
leave
of
our
kind
hostess
she
loaded
us
with
cakes
good
wishes
and
messages
to
her
sister
dixon
and
the
children
we
journeyed
pleasantly
along
through
a
country
beautiful
in
spite
of
its
wintry
appearance
there
was
a
house
at
buffalo
grove
at
which
we
stopped
for
half
an
hour
and
where
a
young
girl
presented
us
with
some
of
her
own
making
she
entertained
us
with
the
history
of
a
contest
between
two
rival
claimants
for
the
patronage
of
the
the
proprietors
of
which
had
not
decided
whether
to
send
it
by
buffalo
grove
or
by
another
route
which
she
pointed
out
to
us
at
no
great
distance
the
she
took
care
to
inform
us
was
in
favor
of
the
former
and
the
blush
with
which
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
to
our
inquiry
is
he
a
young
man
explained
the
whole
matter
satisfactorily
at
length
just
at
sunset
we
reached
the
dark
rapid
waters
of
the
rock
river
the
ferry
which
we
had
travelled
so
far
out
of
our
way
to
take
advantage
of
proved
to
be
merely
a
small
boat
or
skiff
the
larger
one
having
been
swept
off
into
the
stream
and
carried
down
in
the
of
the
ice
the
week
previous
my
husband
first
care
was
to
get
me
across
he
placed
me
with
the
saddles
packs
etc
in
the
boat
and
as
at
that
late
hour
no
time
was
to
be
lost
he
ventured
at
the
same
time
to
hold
the
bridles
of
the
two
most
docile
horses
to
guide
them
in
swimming
the
river
when
we
had
proceeded
a
few
rods
from
the
shore
we
were
startled
by
a
loud
puffing
and
blowing
near
us
and
looking
around
to
our
great
surprise
discovered
little
brunet
just
upon
our
determined
not
to
be
outdone
by
his
model
jerry
he
had
taken
to
the
water
on
his
own
responsibility
and
arrived
at
the
opposite
shore
as
soon
as
any
of
the
party
all
being
safely
landed
a
short
walk
brought
us
to
the
house
of
dixon
although
so
recently
come
into
the
country
he
had
contrived
to
make
everything
comfortable
around
him
and
when
he
ushered
us
into
dixon
and
seated
us
by
a
glowing
wood
fire
while
dixon
busied
herself
in
preparing
us
a
nice
supper
i
felt
that
the
comfort
overbalanced
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
journey
dixon
was
surrounded
by
several
children
one
leaning
against
the
was
dressed
in
the
full
indian
costume
calico
shirt
blanket
and
leggings
his
dark
complexion
and
full
melancholy
eyes
which
he
kept
fixed
upon
the
ashes
in
which
he
was
making
marks
with
a
stick
rarely
raising
them
to
gaze
on
us
as
children
are
wont
to
do
interested
me
exceedingly
and
i
inquired
of
an
intelligent
little
girl
evidently
a
daughter
of
our
host
who
is
that
boy
oh
that
is
john
ogie
answered
she
what
is
the
matter
with
him
he
looks
very
sad
oh
he
is
fretting
after
his
mother
is
she
dead
then
some
say
she
is
dead
and
some
say
she
is
gone
away
i
guess
she
is
dead
and
buried
up
in
one
of
those
graves
yonder
pointing
to
two
or
three
little
picketed
inclosures
upon
a
rising
ground
opposite
the
window
i
felt
a
strong
sympathy
with
the
child
which
was
increased
when
the
little
spokeswoman
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
has
he
no
father
replied
oh
yes
but
he
goes
away
and
drinks
and
do
care
for
his
children
and
what
becomes
of
john
then
he
stays
here
with
us
and
we
teach
him
to
read
and
he
learns
fast
when
the
boy
at
length
turned
his
large
dark
eyes
upon
me
it
went
to
my
heart
it
was
such
a
look
and
it
was
explained
when
long
afterwards
i
learned
his
further
history
his
mother
was
still
living
and
he
knew
it
although
with
the
reserve
peculiar
to
his
people
he
never
spoke
of
her
to
his
young
companions
unable
to
endure
the
continued
ill
treatment
of
her
husband
a
surly
intemperate
canadian
she
had
left
him
and
returned
to
her
own
family
among
the
pottowattamies
years
after
this
boy
and
a
brother
who
had
also
been
left
behind
with
their
father
found
their
way
to
the
upper
missouri
to
join
their
mother
who
with
the
others
of
her
tribe
had
been
removed
by
the
government
from
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
a
most
savory
supper
of
ducks
and
venison
with
their
accompaniments
soon
smoked
upon
the
board
and
we
did
ample
justice
to
it
travelling
is
a
great
sharpener
of
the
appetite
and
so
is
cheerfulness
and
the
latter
was
increased
by
the
encouraging
account
dixon
gave
us
of
the
remainder
of
the
route
yet
before
us
there
is
no
difficulty
said
he
if
you
keep
a
little
to
the
north
and
strike
the
great
if
you
get
too
far
to
the
south
you
will
come
upon
the
winnebago
swamp
and
once
in
that
there
is
no
telling
when
you
will
ever
get
out
again
as
for
the
distance
it
is
nothing
at
all
to
speak
of
two
young
men
came
out
here
from
chicago
on
foot
last
fall
they
got
here
the
evening
of
the
second
day
and
even
with
a
lady
in
your
party
you
could
go
on
horseback
in
less
time
than
that
the
only
thing
is
to
be
sure
and
get
on
the
great
track
that
the
sauks
have
made
in
going
every
year
from
the
mississippi
to
canada
to
receive
their
presents
from
the
british
indian
agent
the
following
morning
which
was
a
bright
and
lovely
one
for
that
season
of
the
year
we
took
leave
of
and
dixon
in
high
spirits
we
travelled
for
the
first
few
miles
along
the
beautiful
undulating
banks
of
the
rock
river
always
in
an
easterly
direction
keeping
the
beaten
path
or
rather
road
which
led
to
fort
clark
or
peoria
the
sauk
trail
we
had
been
told
would
cross
this
road
at
the
distance
of
about
six
miles
after
having
travelled
as
we
judged
fully
that
distance
we
came
upon
a
trail
bearing
northeast
and
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
the
probability
of
its
being
the
one
we
were
in
search
of
kinzie
was
of
opinion
that
it
tended
too
much
to
the
north
and
was
moreover
too
faint
and
obscure
for
a
trail
so
much
used
and
by
so
large
a
body
of
indians
in
their
annual
journeys
plante
was
positive
as
to
its
being
the
very
spot
where
he
and
piché
in
their
journey
to
port
winnebago
the
year
before
struck
into
the
great
road
on
that
very
at
the
point
of
woods
he
remembered
perfectly
well
stopping
to
shoot
ducks
which
they
ate
for
their
supper
kellogg
was
but
sided
alternately
with
each
speaker
as
plante
was
the
guide
and
withal
so
confident
of
being
right
it
was
decided
to
follow
him
not
without
some
demurring
however
on
the
part
of
the
bourgeois
who
every
now
and
then
called
to
halt
to
discuss
the
state
of
affairs
now
plante
he
would
say
i
am
sure
you
are
leading
us
too
far
north
why
man
if
we
keep
on
in
this
direction
following
the
course
of
the
river
we
shall
bring
up
at
instead
of
chicago
ah
mon
bourgeois
would
the
canadian
reply
would
i
tell
you
this
is
the
road
if
i
were
not
quite
certain
only
one
year
ago
i
travelled
it
and
can
i
forget
so
soon
oh
no
i
remember
every
foot
of
it
but
monsieur
plante
was
convinced
of
his
mistake
when
the
trail
brought
us
to
the
great
bend
of
the
river
with
its
bold
rocky
bluffs
are
you
satisfied
now
plante
asked
kinzie
by
your
leave
i
will
now
play
pilot
myself
and
he
struck
off
from
the
trail
in
a
direction
as
nearly
east
as
possible
the
weather
had
changed
and
become
intensely
cold
and
we
felt
that
the
detention
we
had
met
with
even
should
we
now
be
in
the
right
road
was
no
trifling
matter
we
had
not
added
to
our
stock
of
provisions
at
dixon
wishing
to
carry
as
much
forage
as
we
were
able
for
our
horses
for
whom
the
scanty
picking
around
our
afforded
an
insufficient
meal
but
we
were
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
that
we
were
in
the
right
path
at
last
and
we
journeyed
on
until
night
when
we
reached
a
comfortable
encampment
in
the
edge
of
a
grove
near
a
small
stream
oh
how
bitterly
cold
that
night
was
the
salted
provisions
to
which
i
was
accustomed
occasioned
me
an
intolerable
thirst
and
my
husband
was
in
the
habit
of
placing
the
little
tin
filled
with
water
at
my
bed
head
when
we
went
to
rest
but
this
night
it
was
frozen
solid
long
before
midnight
we
were
so
well
wrapped
up
in
blankets
that
we
did
not
suffer
from
cold
while
within
the
tent
but
the
open
air
was
severe
in
the
extreme
march
we
were
roused
by
the
bourgeois
at
peep
of
day
to
make
preparations
for
starting
we
must
find
the
sauk
trail
this
day
at
all
hazards
what
would
become
of
us
should
we
fail
to
do
so
it
was
a
question
no
one
liked
to
ask
and
certainly
one
that
none
could
have
answered
on
leaving
our
encampment
we
found
ourselves
entering
a
marshy
tract
of
country
myriads
of
wild
geese
brant
and
ducks
rose
up
screaming
at
our
approach
the
more
distant
lakes
and
ponds
were
black
with
them
but
the
shallow
water
through
which
we
attempted
to
make
our
way
was
frozen
by
the
severity
of
the
night
to
a
thickness
not
quite
sufficient
to
bear
the
horses
but
just
such
as
to
cut
their
feet
and
ankles
at
every
step
as
they
broke
through
it
sometimes
the
difficulty
of
going
forward
was
so
great
that
we
were
obliged
to
retrace
our
steps
and
make
our
way
round
the
head
of
the
marsh
thus
adding
to
the
discomforts
of
our
situation
by
the
conviction
that
while
journeying
diligently
we
were
in
fact
making
very
little
progress
this
swampy
region
at
length
passed
we
came
upon
more
solid
ground
chiefly
the
open
prairie
but
now
a
new
trouble
assailed
us
the
weather
had
moderated
and
a
blinding
came
on
without
a
trail
that
we
could
rely
upon
and
destitute
of
a
compass
our
only
dependence
had
been
the
sun
to
point
out
our
direction
but
the
atmosphere
was
now
so
obscure
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
in
what
quarter
of
the
heavens
he
was
we
pursued
our
way
however
and
a
devious
one
it
must
have
been
after
travelling
in
this
way
many
miles
we
came
upon
an
indian
trail
deeply
indented
running
at
right
angles
with
the
course
we
were
pursuing
the
snow
had
ceased
and
the
clouds
becoming
thinner
we
were
able
to
observe
the
direction
of
the
sun
and
to
perceive
that
the
trail
ran
north
and
south
what
should
we
do
was
it
safest
to
pursue
our
easterly
course
or
was
it
probable
that
by
following
this
new
path
we
should
fall
into
the
direct
one
we
had
been
so
long
seeking
if
we
decided
to
take
the
trail
should
we
go
north
or
south
kinzie
was
for
the
latter
he
was
of
opinion
we
were
still
too
far
north
somewhere
about
the
grand
marais
or
kellogg
and
plante
were
for
taking
the
northerly
direction
the
latter
was
positive
his
bourgeois
had
already
gone
too
far
south
in
fact
that
we
must
now
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
illinois
river
finding
himself
in
the
minority
my
husband
yielded
and
we
turned
our
horses
heads
north
much
against
his
will
after
proceeding
a
few
miles
however
he
took
a
sudden
determination
you
may
go
north
if
you
please
said
he
but
i
am
convinced
that
the
other
course
is
right
and
i
shall
face
about
follow
who
will
so
we
wheeled
round
and
rode
south
again
and
many
a
long
and
weary
mile
did
we
travel
the
monotony
of
our
ride
broken
only
by
the
querulous
remarks
of
poor
kellogg
i
am
really
afraid
we
are
wrong
kinzie
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
the
young
man
is
right
it
looks
most
natural
to
me
that
we
should
take
a
northerly
course
and
not
be
stretching
away
so
far
to
the
south
to
all
this
kinzie
turned
a
deaf
ear
the
frenchmen
rode
in
silence
they
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
cutting
off
their
right
hand
as
showing
opposition
to
the
bourgeois
when
he
had
once
expressed
his
decision
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
offering
an
opinion
or
remark
unless
called
upon
to
do
so
the
road
which
had
continued
many
miles
through
the
prairie
at
length
in
winding
round
a
point
of
woods
brought
us
suddenly
upon
an
indian
village
a
shout
of
joy
broke
from
the
whole
party
but
no
answering
shout
was
returned
not
even
a
bark
of
friendly
welcome
as
we
galloped
up
to
the
wigwams
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
we
rode
round
and
round
then
dismounted
and
looked
into
several
of
the
spacious
huts
they
had
evidently
been
long
deserted
nothing
remained
but
the
bare
walls
of
bark
from
which
everything
in
the
shape
of
furniture
had
been
stripped
by
the
owners
and
carried
with
them
to
their
to
be
brought
back
in
the
spring
when
they
returned
to
make
their
and
occupy
their
summer
cabins
our
disappointment
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
with
heavy
hearts
we
mounted
and
once
more
pursued
our
way
the
snow
again
falling
and
adding
to
the
discomforts
of
our
position
at
length
we
halted
for
the
night
we
had
long
been
aware
that
our
stock
of
provisions
was
insufficient
for
another
day
and
here
we
were
nobody
knew
where
in
the
midst
of
woods
and
prairies
certainly
far
from
any
human
habitation
with
barely
enough
food
for
a
slender
evening
meal
the
poor
dogs
came
whining
round
us
to
beg
their
usual
portion
but
they
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
a
bare
bone
and
we
retired
to
rest
with
the
feeling
that
if
not
actually
hungry
then
we
should
certainly
be
so
the
morrow
came
plante
and
roy
had
a
bright
fire
and
a
nice
pot
of
coffee
for
us
it
was
our
only
breakfast
for
on
shaking
the
bag
and
turning
it
inside
out
we
could
make
no
more
of
our
stock
of
bread
than
three
crackers
which
the
rest
of
the
party
insisted
i
should
put
in
my
pocket
for
my
dinner
i
was
much
touched
by
the
kindness
of
kellogg
who
drew
from
his
wallet
a
piece
of
tongue
and
a
slice
of
which
he
said
he
had
been
saving
for
since
the
day
before
for
he
saw
how
matters
were
a
going
poor
man
it
would
have
been
well
if
he
had
listened
to
kinzie
and
provided
himself
at
the
outset
with
a
larger
store
of
provisions
as
it
was
those
he
brought
with
him
were
exhausted
early
in
the
second
day
and
he
had
been
with
us
for
the
last
two
meals
we
still
had
the
trail
to
guide
us
and
we
continued
to
follow
it
until
about
nine
when
in
emerging
from
a
wood
we
came
upon
a
broad
and
rapid
river
a
collection
of
indian
wigwams
stood
upon
the
opposite
bank
and
as
the
trail
led
directly
to
the
water
it
was
fair
to
infer
that
the
stream
was
fordable
we
had
no
opportunity
of
testing
it
however
for
the
banks
were
so
lined
with
ice
which
was
piled
up
tier
upon
tier
by
the
of
the
previous
week
that
we
tried
in
vain
to
find
a
path
by
which
we
could
descend
the
bank
to
the
water
the
men
shouted
again
and
again
in
hopes
some
straggling
inhabitant
of
the
village
might
be
at
hand
with
his
canoe
no
answer
was
returned
save
by
the
echoes
what
was
to
be
done
i
looked
at
my
husband
and
saw
that
care
was
on
his
brow
although
he
still
continued
to
speak
cheerfully
we
will
follow
this
down
the
bank
of
the
river
said
he
there
must
be
indians
wintering
near
in
some
of
these
points
of
wood
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
somewhat
dismayed
at
our
prospects
but
i
kept
up
a
show
of
courage
and
did
not
allow
my
despondency
to
be
seen
all
the
party
were
dull
and
gloomy
enough
we
kept
along
the
bank
which
was
considerably
elevated
above
the
water
and
bordered
at
a
little
distance
with
a
thick
wood
all
at
once
my
horse
who
was
mortally
afraid
of
indians
began
to
jump
and
prance
snorting
and
pricking
up
his
ears
as
if
an
enemy
were
at
hand
i
screamed
with
delight
to
my
husband
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
file
oh
john
john
there
are
indians
near
look
at
jerry
at
this
instant
a
little
indian
dog
ran
out
from
under
the
bushes
by
the
roadside
and
began
barking
at
us
never
were
sounds
more
welcome
we
rode
directly
into
the
thicket
and
descending
into
a
little
hollow
found
two
squaws
crouching
behind
the
bushes
trying
to
conceal
themselves
from
our
sight
they
appeared
greatly
relieved
when
kinzie
addressed
them
in
the
pottowattamie
language
what
are
you
doing
here
digging
indian
potatoes
a
species
of
artichoke
where
is
your
lodge
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
good
then
you
have
a
canoe
here
can
you
take
us
across
yes
the
canoe
is
very
small
they
conducted
us
down
the
bank
to
the
water
edge
where
the
canoe
was
it
was
indeed
my
husband
explained
to
them
that
they
must
take
me
across
first
and
then
return
for
the
others
of
the
party
will
you
trust
yourself
alone
over
the
river
inquired
he
you
see
that
but
one
can
cross
at
a
time
oh
yes
and
i
was
soon
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
lying
flat
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
while
the
older
squaw
took
the
paddle
in
her
hand
and
placed
herself
on
her
knees
at
my
head
and
the
younger
a
girl
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
stationed
herself
at
my
feet
there
was
just
room
enough
for
me
to
lie
in
this
position
each
of
the
others
kneeling
in
the
opposite
ends
of
the
canoe
while
these
preparations
were
making
kinzie
questioned
the
women
as
to
our
whereabout
they
knew
no
name
for
the
river
but
saumanong
this
was
not
definite
it
being
the
generic
term
for
any
large
stream
but
he
gathered
that
the
village
we
had
passed
higher
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
was
and
then
he
knew
that
we
were
on
the
fox
river
and
probably
about
fifty
miles
from
chicago
the
squaw
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
assured
him
that
chicago
was
close
by
that
means
said
he
that
it
is
not
so
far
off
as
canada
we
must
not
be
too
sanguine
the
men
set
about
unpacking
the
horses
and
i
in
the
mean
time
was
paddled
across
the
river
the
old
woman
immediately
returned
leaving
the
younger
one
with
me
for
company
i
seated
myself
on
the
fallen
trunk
of
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
snow
and
looked
across
the
dark
waters
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
my
weakness
for
the
first
time
on
my
journey
i
shed
tears
it
was
neither
hunger
nor
fear
nor
cold
which
extorted
them
from
me
it
was
the
utter
desolation
of
spirit
the
sickness
of
heart
which
hope
deferred
ever
occasions
and
which
of
all
evils
is
the
hardest
to
bear
the
poor
little
squaw
looked
into
my
face
with
a
wondering
and
sympathizing
expression
probably
she
was
speculating
in
her
own
mind
what
a
person
who
rode
so
fine
a
horse
and
wore
so
comfortable
a
broadcloth
dress
could
have
to
cry
about
i
pointed
to
a
seat
beside
me
on
the
log
but
she
preferred
standing
and
gazing
at
me
with
the
same
pitying
expression
presently
she
was
joined
by
a
young
companion
and
after
a
short
chattering
of
which
i
was
evidently
the
subject
they
both
trotted
off
into
the
woods
and
left
me
to
my
own
solitary
reflections
what
would
my
friends
at
the
east
think
said
i
to
myself
if
they
could
see
me
now
what
would
poor
old
welsh
say
she
who
warned
me
that
i
came
away
so
far
to
the
west
i
should
break
my
heart
would
she
not
rejoice
to
find
how
likely
her
prediction
was
to
be
fulfilled
these
thoughts
roused
me
i
dried
up
my
tears
and
by
the
time
my
husband
with
his
party
and
all
his
horses
and
luggage
were
across
i
had
recovered
my
cheerfulness
and
was
ready
for
fresh
adventures
chapter
xvi
relief
we
followed
the
old
squaw
to
her
lodge
which
was
at
no
great
distance
in
the
woods
i
had
never
before
been
in
an
indian
lodge
although
i
had
occasionally
peeped
into
one
of
the
many
always
clustered
round
the
house
of
the
interpreter
at
the
portage
this
one
was
very
nicely
arranged
four
sticks
of
wood
placed
to
form
a
square
in
the
centre
answered
the
purpose
of
a
hearth
within
which
the
fire
was
built
the
smoke
escaping
through
an
opening
in
the
top
the
mats
of
which
the
lodge
was
constructed
were
very
neat
and
new
and
against
the
sides
depending
from
the
poles
or
hung
various
bags
of
indian
manufacture
containing
their
dried
food
and
other
household
treasures
sundry
ladles
small
kettles
and
wooden
bowls
also
hung
from
the
and
dangling
from
the
centre
by
an
iron
chain
was
a
large
kettle
in
which
some
dark
substance
was
seething
over
the
scanty
fire
on
the
floor
of
the
lodge
between
the
fire
and
the
outer
wall
were
spread
mats
upon
which
my
husband
invited
me
to
be
seated
and
make
myself
comfortable
the
first
demand
of
an
indian
on
meeting
a
white
man
is
for
of
which
they
are
exceedingly
fond
and
i
knew
enough
of
the
pottowattamie
language
to
comprehend
the
timid
i
have
no
bread
with
which
the
squaw
commenced
our
conversation
after
my
husband
had
left
the
lodge
i
shook
my
head
and
endeavored
to
convey
to
her
that
so
far
from
being
able
to
give
i
had
had
no
breakfast
myself
she
understood
me
and
instantly
produced
a
bowl
into
which
she
ladled
a
quantity
of
indian
potatoes
from
the
kettle
over
the
fire
and
set
them
before
me
i
was
too
hungry
to
be
fastidious
and
owing
partly
no
doubt
to
the
sharpness
of
my
appetite
i
really
found
them
delicious
two
little
girls
inmates
of
the
lodge
sat
gazing
at
me
with
evident
admiration
and
astonishment
which
were
increased
when
i
took
my
little
prayer
book
from
my
pocket
and
began
to
read
they
had
undoubtedly
never
seen
a
book
before
and
i
was
amused
at
the
care
with
which
they
looked
from
me
while
they
questioned
their
mother
about
my
strange
employment
and
listened
to
her
replies
while
thus
occupied
i
was
startled
by
a
sudden
sound
of
hogh
and
the
mat
which
hung
over
the
entrance
of
the
lodge
was
raised
and
an
indian
entered
with
that
graceful
bound
which
is
peculiar
to
themselves
it
was
the
master
of
the
lodge
who
had
been
out
to
shoot
ducks
and
was
just
returned
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
cheerful
open
countenance
and
he
listened
to
what
his
wife
in
a
quiet
tone
related
to
him
while
he
divested
himself
of
his
accoutrements
in
the
most
unembarrassed
manner
imaginable
soon
my
husband
joined
us
he
had
been
engaged
in
attending
to
the
comfort
of
his
horses
and
assisting
his
men
in
making
their
fire
and
pitching
their
tent
which
the
rising
storm
made
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
from
the
indian
he
learned
that
we
were
in
what
was
called
the
big
woods
or
piché
grove
from
a
frenchman
of
that
name
living
not
far
from
the
spot
that
the
river
we
had
crossed
was
the
fox
river
that
he
could
guide
us
to
from
which
the
road
was
perfectly
plain
or
even
into
chicago
if
we
preferred
but
that
we
had
better
remain
encamped
for
that
day
as
there
was
a
storm
coming
on
and
in
the
mean
time
he
would
go
and
shoot
some
ducks
for
our
dinner
and
supper
he
was
accordingly
furnished
with
powder
and
shot
and
set
off
again
for
game
without
delay
i
had
put
into
my
pocket
on
leaving
home
a
roll
of
scarlet
ribbon
in
case
a
stout
string
should
be
wanted
and
i
now
drew
it
forth
and
with
the
knife
which
hung
around
my
neck
i
cut
off
a
couple
of
yards
for
each
of
the
little
girls
they
received
it
with
great
delight
and
their
mother
dividing
each
portion
into
two
tied
a
piece
to
each
of
the
little
clubs
into
which
their
hair
was
knotted
on
the
temples
they
laughed
and
exclaimed
saum
as
they
gazed
at
each
other
and
their
mother
joined
in
their
mirth
although
as
i
thought
a
little
unwilling
to
display
her
maternal
exultation
before
a
stranger
the
tent
being
all
in
order
my
husband
came
for
me
and
we
took
leave
of
our
friends
in
the
wigwam
with
grateful
hearts
the
storm
was
raging
without
the
trees
were
bending
and
cracking
around
us
and
the
air
was
completely
filled
with
the
screaming
and
as
they
made
their
way
southward
before
the
blast
our
tent
was
among
the
trees
not
far
from
the
river
my
husband
took
me
to
the
bank
to
look
for
a
moment
at
what
we
had
escaped
the
wind
was
sweeping
down
from
the
north
in
a
perfect
hurricane
the
water
was
filled
with
masses
of
snow
and
ice
dancing
along
upon
the
torrent
over
which
were
hurrying
thousands
of
making
the
woods
resound
to
their
deafening
clamor
had
we
been
one
hour
later
we
could
not
possibly
have
crossed
the
stream
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
for
us
but
to
have
remained
and
starved
in
the
wilderness
could
we
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
that
kind
providence
that
had
brought
us
safely
through
such
dangers
the
men
had
cut
down
an
immense
tree
and
built
a
fire
against
it
but
the
wind
shifted
so
continually
that
every
five
minutes
the
tent
would
become
completely
filled
with
smoke
so
that
i
was
driven
into
the
open
air
for
breath
then
i
would
seat
myself
on
one
end
of
the
huge
log
as
near
the
fire
as
possible
for
it
was
dismally
cold
but
the
wind
seemed
actuated
by
a
kind
of
caprice
for
in
whatever
direction
i
took
my
seat
just
that
way
came
the
smoke
and
hot
ashes
puffing
in
my
face
until
i
was
nearly
blinded
neither
veil
nor
silk
handkerchief
afforded
an
effectual
protection
and
i
was
glad
when
the
arrival
of
our
huntsmen
with
a
quantity
of
ducks
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
diverting
my
thoughts
from
my
own
sufferings
by
aiding
the
men
to
pick
them
and
get
them
ready
for
our
meal
we
borrowed
a
kettle
from
our
indian
friends
it
was
not
remarkably
clean
but
we
heated
a
little
water
in
it
and
it
out
before
consigning
our
birds
to
it
and
with
a
bowl
of
indian
potatoes
a
present
from
our
kind
neighbors
we
soon
had
an
excellent
soup
what
with
the
cold
the
smoke
and
the
driving
ashes
and
cinders
this
was
the
most
uncomfortable
afternoon
i
had
yet
passed
and
i
was
glad
when
night
came
and
i
could
creep
into
the
tent
and
cover
myself
up
in
the
blankets
out
of
the
way
of
all
three
of
these
evils
the
storm
raged
with
tenfold
violence
during
the
night
we
were
continually
startled
by
the
crashing
of
the
falling
trees
around
us
and
who
could
tell
but
that
the
next
would
be
upon
us
spite
of
our
fatigue
we
passed
an
almost
sleepless
night
when
we
arose
in
the
morning
we
were
made
fully
alive
to
the
perils
by
which
we
had
been
surrounded
at
least
fifty
trees
the
giants
of
the
forest
lay
prostrate
within
view
of
the
tent
when
we
had
taken
our
scanty
breakfast
and
were
mounted
and
ready
for
departure
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
thread
our
way
so
completely
was
it
obstructed
by
the
fallen
trunks
our
indian
guide
had
joined
us
at
an
early
hour
and
after
conducting
us
carefully
out
of
the
wood
and
pointing
out
to
us
numerous
for
which
he
said
that
grove
was
famous
he
set
off
at
a
long
trot
and
about
nine
brought
us
to
a
log
cabin
on
a
rising
ground
looking
off
over
the
broad
prairie
to
the
east
we
had
hoped
to
get
some
refreshment
here
piché
being
an
old
acquaintance
of
some
of
the
party
but
alas
the
master
was
from
home
we
found
his
cabin
occupied
by
indians
and
travellers
the
latter
few
the
former
numerous
there
was
no
temptation
to
a
halt
except
that
of
warming
ourselves
at
a
bright
fire
that
was
burning
in
the
clay
chimney
a
man
in
quaker
costume
stepped
forward
to
answer
our
inquiries
and
offered
to
become
our
escort
to
chicago
to
which
place
he
was
bound
so
we
dismissed
our
indian
friend
with
a
satisfactory
remuneration
for
all
the
trouble
he
had
so
kindly
taken
for
us
a
long
reach
of
prairie
extended
from
piché
to
the
du
page
between
the
two
forks
of
which
dogherty
our
new
acquaintance
told
us
we
should
find
the
dwelling
of
a
hawley
who
would
give
us
a
comfortable
dinner
the
weather
was
intensely
cold
the
wind
sweeping
over
the
wide
prairie
with
nothing
to
break
its
force
chilled
our
very
hearts
i
beat
my
feet
against
the
saddle
to
restore
the
circulation
when
they
became
benumbed
with
the
cold
until
they
were
so
bruised
i
could
beat
them
no
longer
not
a
house
or
wigwam
not
even
a
clump
of
trees
as
a
shelter
offered
itself
for
many
a
weary
mile
at
length
we
reached
the
west
fork
of
the
du
page
it
was
frozen
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
bear
the
horses
our
only
resource
was
to
cut
a
way
for
them
through
the
ice
it
was
a
work
of
time
for
the
ice
had
frozen
to
several
inches
in
thickness
during
the
last
bitter
night
plante
went
first
with
an
axe
and
cut
as
far
as
he
could
reach
then
mounted
one
of
the
hardy
little
ponies
and
with
some
difficulty
broke
the
ice
before
him
until
he
had
opened
a
passage
to
the
opposite
shore
how
the
poor
animals
shivered
as
they
were
reined
in
among
the
floating
ice
and
we
who
sat
waiting
in
the
piercing
wind
were
not
much
better
off
probably
brunet
was
of
the
same
opinion
for
with
his
usual
perversity
he
plunged
in
immediately
after
plante
and
stood
shaking
and
quaking
behind
him
every
now
and
then
looking
around
him
as
much
as
to
say
i
got
ahead
of
you
this
time
we
were
all
across
at
last
and
spurred
on
our
horses
until
we
reached
hawley
a
large
commodious
dwelling
near
the
east
fork
of
the
river
the
good
woman
welcomed
us
kindly
and
soon
made
us
warm
and
comfortable
we
felt
as
if
we
were
in
a
civilized
land
once
more
she
proceeded
immediately
to
prepare
dinner
for
us
and
we
watched
her
with
eager
eyes
as
she
took
down
a
huge
ham
from
the
rafters
out
of
which
she
cut
innumerable
slices
then
broke
a
dozen
or
more
of
fine
fresh
eggs
into
a
pan
in
readiness
for
frying
then
mixed
a
and
placed
it
against
a
board
in
front
of
the
fire
to
bake
it
seemed
to
me
that
even
with
the
aid
of
this
fine
bright
fire
the
dinner
took
an
unconscionable
time
to
cook
but
cooked
it
was
at
last
and
truly
might
the
good
woman
stare
at
the
travellers
appetites
we
had
brought
with
us
she
did
not
know
what
short
commons
we
had
been
on
for
the
last
two
days
we
found
upon
inquiry
that
we
could
by
pushing
on
reach
lawton
on
the
aux
plaines
that
night
we
should
then
be
within
twelve
miles
of
chicago
of
course
we
made
no
unnecessary
delay
but
set
off
as
soon
after
dinner
as
possible
the
crossing
of
the
east
fork
of
the
du
page
was
more
perilous
than
the
former
one
had
been
the
ice
had
become
broken
either
by
the
force
of
the
current
or
by
some
equestrians
having
preceded
us
and
cut
through
it
so
that
when
we
reached
the
bank
the
ice
was
floating
down
in
large
cakes
the
horses
had
to
make
a
rapid
dart
through
the
water
which
was
so
high
and
rushing
in
such
a
torrent
that
if
i
had
not
been
mounted
on
jerry
the
tallest
horse
in
the
cavalcade
i
must
have
got
a
terrible
splashing
as
it
was
i
was
well
frightened
and
grasped
both
bridle
and
mane
with
the
utmost
tenacity
after
this
we
travelled
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
order
to
reach
our
place
of
destination
before
dark
dogherty
a
tall
man
half
quaker
half
methodist
did
his
best
to
entertain
me
by
giving
me
a
thorough
schedule
of
his
religious
opinions
with
the
reasons
from
scripture
upon
which
they
were
based
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
perfectionist
and
evidently
looked
upon
himself
with
no
small
satisfaction
as
a
living
illustration
of
his
favorite
doctrine
john
says
this
was
the
style
of
his
discourse
john
says
that
is
born
of
god
doth
not
commit
sin
now
i
am
born
of
god
i
do
not
commit
sin
i
was
too
cold
and
too
weary
to
argue
the
point
so
i
let
him
have
it
all
his
own
way
i
believe
he
must
have
thought
me
rather
a
dull
companion
but
at
least
he
gave
me
the
credit
of
being
a
good
listener
it
was
almost
dark
when
we
reached
lawton
the
aux
plaines
was
frozen
and
the
house
was
on
the
other
side
by
loud
shouting
we
brought
out
a
man
from
the
building
and
he
succeeded
in
cutting
the
ice
and
bringing
a
canoe
over
to
us
but
not
until
it
had
become
difficult
to
distinguish
objects
in
the
darkness
a
very
comfortable
house
was
lawton
after
we
did
reach
it
carpeted
and
with
a
warm
stove
in
fact
quite
in
civilized
style
mr
weeks
the
man
who
brought
us
across
was
the
during
the
temporary
absence
of
lawton
lawton
was
a
young
woman
and
not
she
complained
bitterly
of
the
loneliness
of
her
condition
and
having
been
brought
out
there
into
the
woods
which
was
a
thing
she
had
not
expected
when
she
came
from
the
east
we
did
not
ask
her
with
what
expectations
she
had
come
to
a
wild
unsettled
country
but
we
tried
to
comfort
her
with
the
assurance
that
things
would
grow
better
in
a
few
years
she
said
she
did
not
mean
to
wait
for
that
she
should
go
back
to
her
family
in
the
east
if
lawton
did
not
invite
some
of
her
young
friends
to
come
and
stay
with
her
and
make
it
agreeable
we
could
hardly
realize
on
rising
the
following
morning
that
only
twelve
miles
of
prairie
intervened
between
us
and
le
as
i
could
not
but
name
it
we
could
look
across
the
extended
plain
and
on
its
farthest
verge
were
visible
two
tall
trees
which
my
husband
pointed
out
to
me
as
the
planting
of
his
own
hand
when
a
boy
already
they
had
become
so
lofty
as
to
serve
as
landmarks
and
they
were
constantly
in
view
as
we
travelled
the
beaten
road
i
was
continually
repeating
to
myself
there
live
the
friends
i
am
so
longing
to
see
there
will
terminate
all
our
trials
and
hardships
a
wentworth
joined
us
on
the
road
and
of
him
we
inquired
after
the
welfare
of
the
family
from
whom
we
had
for
a
long
time
received
no
intelligence
when
we
reached
chicago
he
took
us
to
a
little
tavern
at
the
forks
of
the
river
this
portion
of
the
place
was
then
called
from
its
having
been
the
residence
of
an
indian
named
or
the
wolf
dear
me
said
the
old
landlady
at
the
little
tavern
what
dreadful
cold
weather
you
must
have
had
to
travel
in
why
two
days
ago
the
river
was
all
open
here
and
now
it
frozen
hard
enough
for
folks
to
cross
notwithstanding
this
assurance
my
husband
did
not
like
to
venture
so
he
determined
to
leave
his
horses
and
proceed
on
foot
to
the
residence
of
his
mother
and
sister
a
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
we
set
out
on
our
walk
which
was
first
across
the
ice
then
down
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
as
we
approached
the
house
we
were
espied
by
genevieve
a
servant
of
the
family
she
did
not
wait
to
salute
us
but
flew
into
the
house
crying
oh
madame
kinzie
who
do
you
think
has
come
monsieur
john
and
madame
john
all
the
way
from
fort
winnebago
on
foot
soon
we
were
in
the
arms
of
our
dear
kind
friends
a
messenger
was
dispatched
to
the
garrison
for
the
remaining
members
of
the
family
and
for
that
day
at
least
i
was
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
the
whole
circle
for
the
dangers
i
had
seen
chapter
xvii
chicago
in
fort
dearborn
at
that
day
consisted
of
the
same
buildings
as
at
present
they
were
of
course
in
a
better
state
of
preservation
though
still
considerably
dilapidated
they
had
been
erected
in
under
the
supervision
of
captain
hezekiah
bradley
and
there
was
a
story
current
that
such
was
his
patriotic
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
government
he
obliged
the
soldiers
to
fashion
wooden
pins
instead
of
spikes
and
nails
to
fasten
the
timbers
of
the
buildings
and
that
he
even
called
on
the
junior
officers
to
aid
in
their
construction
along
with
the
soldiers
whose
business
it
was
if
this
were
true
the
captain
must
have
labored
under
the
delusion
excusable
in
one
who
had
lived
long
on
the
frontier
that
government
would
thank
its
servants
for
any
excess
of
economical
zeal
the
fort
was
inclosed
by
high
pickets
with
bastions
at
the
alternate
angles
large
gates
opened
to
the
north
and
south
and
there
were
small
posterns
here
and
there
for
the
accommodation
of
the
inmates
the
bank
of
the
river
which
stretches
to
the
west
now
covered
by
the
buildings
and
inclosed
by
docks
was
then
occupied
by
the
of
the
garrison
beyond
the
which
extended
south
of
the
pickets
were
the
company
gardens
well
filled
with
and
young
the
fort
stood
at
what
might
naturally
be
supposed
to
be
the
mouth
of
the
river
it
was
not
so
however
for
in
those
days
the
latter
took
a
turn
sweeping
round
the
promontory
on
which
the
fort
was
built
towards
the
south
and
joining
the
lake
about
half
a
mile
below
these
buildings
stood
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
the
left
being
a
long
spit
of
land
extending
from
the
northern
shore
of
which
it
formed
a
part
after
the
cutting
through
of
this
portion
of
the
left
bank
in
by
the
united
states
engineers
employed
to
construct
a
harbor
at
this
point
and
the
throwing
out
of
the
piers
the
water
overflowed
this
long
tongue
of
land
and
continually
encroaching
on
the
southern
bank
robbed
it
of
many
valuable
acres
while
by
the
same
action
of
the
vast
body
of
the
lake
an
accretion
was
constantly
taking
place
on
the
north
of
the
harbor
the
residence
of
jean
baptiste
beaubien
stood
at
this
period
between
the
gardens
and
the
and
still
farther
south
was
a
rickety
tenement
built
many
years
before
by
john
dean
the
sutler
of
the
post
a
short
time
after
the
commencement
of
the
growth
of
chicago
the
foundations
of
this
building
were
undermined
by
the
gradual
encroachment
of
the
lake
and
it
tumbled
backward
down
the
bank
where
it
long
lay
a
melancholy
spectacle
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
directly
facing
the
fort
was
the
family
mansion
of
my
husband
it
was
a
long
low
building
with
a
piazza
extending
along
its
front
a
range
of
four
or
five
rooms
a
broad
green
space
was
inclosed
between
it
and
the
river
and
shaded
by
a
row
of
lombardy
poplars
two
immense
stood
in
the
rear
of
the
building
one
of
which
still
remains
as
an
ancient
landmark
a
fine
garden
extended
to
the
north
of
the
dwelling
and
surrounding
it
were
various
buildings
appertaining
to
the
establishment
dairy
for
the
frenchmen
and
stables
a
vast
range
of
covered
with
stunted
cedars
pines
and
intervened
between
the
house
and
the
lake
which
was
at
this
time
not
more
than
thirty
rods
distant
proceeding
from
this
point
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
we
came
first
to
the
agency
house
cobweb
castle
as
it
had
been
denominated
while
long
the
residence
of
a
bachelor
and
the
adhered
to
it
ever
after
it
stood
at
what
is
now
the
southwest
corner
of
wolcott
and
water
streets
many
will
still
remember
it
a
substantial
compact
little
building
of
logs
hewed
and
squared
with
a
centre
two
wings
and
strictly
speaking
two
since
when
there
was
found
no
more
room
for
additions
at
the
sides
they
were
placed
in
the
rear
whereon
a
vacant
spot
could
be
found
these
appendages
did
not
mar
the
symmetry
of
the
whole
as
viewed
from
the
front
but
when
in
the
process
of
the
town
improvement
a
street
was
maliciously
opened
directly
in
the
rear
of
the
building
the
whole
establishment
with
its
comical
little
adjuncts
was
a
constant
source
of
amusement
to
the
no
matter
there
were
pleasant
happy
hours
passed
under
its
roof
as
many
of
chicago
early
settlers
can
testify
around
the
agency
house
were
grouped
a
collection
of
log
buildings
the
residences
of
the
different
persons
in
the
employ
of
government
appertaining
to
that
establishment
blacksmith
striker
and
laborers
these
were
for
the
most
part
canadians
or
with
occasionally
a
stray
yankee
to
set
all
things
going
by
his
activity
and
enterprise
there
was
still
another
house
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
built
by
a
former
resident
by
the
name
of
miller
but
he
had
removed
to
rivière
du
chemin
or
trail
creek
which
about
this
time
began
to
be
called
michigan
city
this
house
which
stood
near
the
forks
of
the
river
was
at
this
time
vacant
there
was
no
house
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
between
the
fort
and
the
point
as
the
forks
of
the
river
were
then
called
the
land
was
a
low
wet
prairie
scarcely
affording
good
walking
in
the
dryest
summer
weather
while
at
other
seasons
it
was
absolutely
impassable
a
muddy
streamlet
or
as
it
is
called
in
this
country
a
after
winding
around
from
about
the
present
site
of
the
tremont
house
fell
into
the
river
at
the
foot
of
state
street
at
the
point
on
the
south
side
stood
a
house
just
completed
by
mark
beaubien
it
was
a
pretentious
white
building
with
wooden
shutters
the
admiration
of
all
the
little
circle
at
wolf
point
here
a
canoe
ferry
was
kept
to
transport
people
across
the
south
branch
of
the
river
facing
down
the
river
from
the
west
was
first
a
small
tavern
kept
by
wentworth
familiarly
known
as
old
geese
not
from
any
want
of
shrewdness
on
his
part
but
in
compliment
to
one
of
his
own
cant
expressions
near
him
were
two
or
three
log
cabins
occupied
by
robinson
the
pottowattamie
chief
and
some
of
his
wife
connexions
billy
caldwell
the
too
resided
here
occasionally
with
his
wife
who
was
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
most
famous
chiefs
of
the
nation
a
little
remote
from
these
residences
was
a
small
square
log
building
originally
designed
for
a
but
occasionally
used
as
a
place
of
worship
whenever
any
itinerant
minister
presented
himself
the
family
of
clybourn
had
previous
to
this
time
established
themselves
near
their
present
residence
on
the
north
branch
they
called
their
place
four
miles
up
the
south
branch
was
an
old
building
which
was
at
one
time
an
object
of
great
interest
as
having
been
the
theatre
of
some
stirring
events
during
the
troubles
of
it
was
denominated
lee
place
or
hardscrabble
here
lived
at
this
time
a
settler
named
heacock
owing
to
the
badness
of
the
roads
a
greater
part
of
the
year
the
usual
mode
of
communication
between
the
fort
and
the
point
was
by
a
boat
rowed
up
the
river
or
by
a
canoe
paddled
by
some
skilful
hand
by
the
latter
means
too
an
intercourse
was
kept
up
between
the
residents
of
the
fort
and
the
agency
house
there
were
at
this
time
two
companies
of
soldiers
in
the
garrison
but
of
the
officers
one
lieutenant
furman
had
died
the
autumn
previous
and
several
of
the
others
were
away

i
think
this
enumeration
comprises
all
the
white
inhabitants
of
chicago
at
a
period
less
than
half
a
century
ago
to
many
who
may
read
these
pages
the
foregoing
particulars
will
doubtless
appear
uninteresting
but
to
those
who
visit
chicago
and
still
more
to
those
who
come
to
make
it
their
home
it
may
be
not
without
interest
to
look
back
to
its
first
beginnings
to
contemplate
the
almost
magical
change
which
a
few
years
have
wrought
and
from
the
past
to
augur
the
marvellous
prosperity
of
the
future
the
origin
of
the
name
chicago
is
a
subject
of
discussion
some
of
the
indians
deriving
it
from
the
fitch
or
polecat
others
from
the
wild
onion
with
which
the
woods
formerly
abounded
but
all
agree
that
the
place
received
its
name
from
an
old
chief
who
was
drowned
in
the
stream
in
former
times
that
this
event
although
so
carefully
preserved
by
tradition
must
have
occurred
in
a
very
remote
period
is
evident
from
an
old
french
manuscript
brought
by
general
cass
from
france
in
this
paper
which
purports
to
be
a
letter
from
de
ligney
at
green
bay
to
de
siette
among
the
illinois
dated
as
early
as
the
place
is
designated
as
this
orthography
is
also
found
in
old
family
letters
of
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
in
giving
the
early
history
of
chicago
the
indians
say
with
great
simplicity
the
first
white
man
who
settled
here
was
a
negro
this
was
jean
baptiste
a
native
of
domingo
who
about
the
year
found
his
way
to
this
remote
region
and
commenced
a
life
among
the
indians
there
is
usually
a
strong
affection
between
these
two
races
and
jean
baptiste
imposed
upon
his
new
friends
by
making
them
believe
that
he
had
been
a
great
chief
among
the
whites
perhaps
he
was
disgusted
at
not
being
elected
to
a
similar
dignity
by
the
pottowattamies
for
he
quitted
this
vicinity
and
finally
terminated
his
days
at
peoria
under
the
roof
of
his
friend
glamorgan
another
domingo
negro
who
had
obtained
large
spanish
grants
in
louis
and
its
environs
and
who
at
one
time
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
an
extensive
landed
estate
had
made
some
improvements
at
chicago
which
were
taken
possession
of
by
a
frenchman
named
le
mai
who
commenced
trading
with
the
indians
after
a
few
years
le
mai
establishment
was
purchased
by
john
kinzie
who
at
that
time
resided
at
bertrand
or
aux
as
it
was
then
called
near
niles
in
michigan
as
this
gentleman
was
for
nearly
twenty
years
with
the
exception
of
the
military
the
only
white
inhabitant
of
northern
illinois
some
particulars
of
his
early
life
may
not
be
uninteresting
he
was
born
in
quebec
in
his
mother
had
been
previously
married
to
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
haliburton
the
only
daughter
of
this
marriage
was
the
mother
of
general
fleming
nicholas
low
and
charles
king
of
new
york
she
is
described
as
a
lady
of
remarkable
beauty
and
accomplishments
kinzie
was
the
only
child
of
the
second
marriage
his
father
died
in
his
infancy
and
his
mother
married
a
third
time
a
forsyth
after
which
they
removed
to
the
city
of
new
york
at
the
age
of
ten
or
eleven
years
he
was
placed
at
school
with
two
of
his
at
williamsburg
a
negro
servant
was
sent
from
the
city
every
saturday
to
bring
the
children
home
to
remain
until
the
following
monday
morning
upon
one
occasion
when
the
messenger
arrived
at
the
school
he
found
all
things
in
commotion
johnny
kinzie
was
missing
search
was
made
in
all
directions
every
place
was
ransacked
it
was
all
in
vain
no
johnny
kinzie
could
be
found
the
heavy
tidings
were
carried
home
to
his
mother
by
some
it
was
supposed
the
lad
was
drowned
by
others
that
he
had
strayed
away
and
would
return
weeks
passed
by
and
months
and
he
was
at
length
given
up
and
mourned
as
lost
in
the
mean
time
the
boy
was
fulfilling
a
determination
he
had
long
formed
to
visit
his
native
city
of
quebec
and
make
his
way
in
life
for
himself
he
had
by
some
means
succeeded
in
crossing
from
williamsburg
to
the
city
of
new
york
and
finding
at
one
of
the
docks
on
the
north
river
a
sloop
bound
for
albany
he
took
passage
on
board
of
her
while
on
his
way
up
the
river
he
was
noticed
by
a
gentleman
who
taking
an
interest
in
the
little
lonely
passenger
questioned
him
about
his
business
he
was
going
to
quebec
where
he
had
some
friends
had
he
the
means
to
carry
him
there
not
much
but
he
thought
he
could
get
along
it
happened
fortunately
that
the
gentleman
himself
was
going
to
quebec
he
took
the
boy
under
his
care
paid
his
expenses
the
whole
distance
and
finally
parted
with
him
in
the
streets
of
the
city
where
he
was
in
truth
a
stranger
he
wandered
about
for
a
time
looking
into
various
stores
and
workshops
at
length
on
entering
the
shop
of
a
silversmith
he
was
satisfied
with
the
expression
he
read
in
the
countenance
of
the
master
and
he
inquired
if
he
wanted
an
apprentice
what
you
my
little
fellow
what
can
you
do
anything
you
can
teach
me
well
we
will
make
a
trial
and
see
the
trial
was
satisfactory
he
remained
in
the
family
of
his
kind
friend
for
more
than
three
years
when
his
parents
who
in
removing
to
detroit
had
necessarily
returned
to
canada
discovered
his
place
of
abode
and
he
was
restored
to
them
there
were
five
younger
of
the
name
of
forsyth
in
the
old
family
bible
we
find
the
following
touching
record
of
an
event
that
occurred
after
the
family
had
removed
to
detroit
george
forsyth
was
lost
in
the
woods
august
when
henry
hays
and
mark
stirling
ran
away
and
left
him
the
remains
of
george
forsyth
were
found
by
an
indian
the
of
october
close
by
the
prairie
ronde
it
seems
a
singular
fatality
that
the
unhappy
mother
should
have
been
twice
called
to
suffer
a
similar
affliction
the
loss
of
a
child
in
a
manner
worse
than
death
inasmuch
as
it
left
room
for
all
the
horrors
that
imagination
can
suggest
the
particulars
of
the
loss
of
this
little
brother
were
these
as
he
came
from
school
one
evening
he
met
the
colored
on
horseback
going
to
the
common
for
the
cows
the
stood
quite
near
the
old
fort
and
all
beyond
that
towards
the
west
was
a
wild
uncultivated
tract
called
the
common
the
child
begged
of
the
servant
to
take
him
up
and
give
him
a
ride
but
the
other
refused
bidding
him
return
home
at
once
he
was
accompanied
by
two
other
boys
somewhat
older
and
together
they
followed
the
negro
for
some
distance
hoping
to
prevail
upon
him
to
give
them
a
ride
as
it
grew
dark
the
two
older
boys
turned
back
but
the
other
kept
on
when
the
negro
returned
he
had
not
again
seen
the
child
nor
were
any
tidings
ever
received
of
him
notwithstanding
the
diligent
search
made
by
the
whole
little
community
until
as
related
in
the
record
his
remains
were
found
the
following
year
by
an
indian
there
was
nothing
to
identify
them
except
the
auburn
curls
of
his
hair
and
the
little
boots
he
had
worn
he
must
have
perished
very
shortly
after
having
lost
his
way
for
the
prairie
ronde
was
too
near
the
settlement
to
have
prevented
his
bearing
the
calls
and
sounding
horns
of
those
in
search
of
him
had
he
been
living
kinzie
enterprising
and
adventurous
disposition
led
him
as
he
grew
older
to
live
much
on
the
frontier
he
early
entered
into
the
indian
trade
and
had
establishments
at
sandusky
and
maumee
about
the
year
he
pushed
farther
west
to
joseph
michigan
in
this
year
he
married
mckillip
the
widow
of
a
british
officer
and
in
came
to
make
his
home
at
chicago
it
was
in
this
year
that
the
first
fort
was
built
by
major
john
whistler
by
degrees
more
remote
were
established
by
him
all
contributing
to
the
parent
one
at
chicago
at
milwaukie
with
the
menomonees
at
rock
river
with
the
winnebagoes
and
the
pottowattamies
on
the
illinois
river
and
kankakee
with
the
pottowattamies
of
the
prairies
and
with
the
kickapoos
in
what
was
called
being
the
widely
extended
district
afterwards
erected
into
sangamon
county
each
had
its
superintendent
and
its
complement
of
engagés
its
train
of
and
its
equipment
of
boats
and
canoes
from
most
of
the
stations
the
furs
and
peltries
were
brought
to
chicago
on
and
the
goods
necessary
for
the
trade
were
transported
in
return
by
the
same
method
the
vessels
which
came
in
the
spring
and
fall
seldom
more
than
two
or
three
annually
to
bring
the
supplies
and
goods
for
the
trade
took
the
furs
that
were
already
collected
to
mackinac
the
depôt
of
the
southwest
and
american
fur
companies
at
other
seasons
they
were
sent
to
that
place
in
boats
coasting
around
the
lake
of
the
canadian
voyageurs
or
engagés
a
race
that
has
now
so
nearly
passed
away
some
notice
may
very
properly
here
be
given
they
were
unlike
any
other
class
of
men
like
the
poet
they
seemed
born
to
their
vocation
sturdy
enduring
ingenious
and
they
possessed
a
spirit
capable
of
adapting
itself
to
any
emergency
no
difficulties
baffled
no
hardships
discouraged
them
while
their
affectionate
nature
led
them
to
form
attachments
of
the
warmest
character
to
their
bourgeois
or
master
as
well
as
to
the
native
inhabitants
among
whom
their
engagements
carried
them
montreal
or
according
to
their
own
pronunciation
was
their
depôt
it
was
at
that
place
that
the
agents
commissioned
to
make
up
the
quota
for
the
different
companies
and
traders
found
the
material
for
their
selections
the
terms
of
engagement
were
usually
from
four
to
six
hundred
livres
ancient
quebec
currency
per
annum
as
wages
with
rations
of
one
quart
of
lyed
corn
and
two
ounces
of
tallow
per
diem
or
its
equivalent
in
whatever
sort
of
food
is
to
be
found
in
the
indian
country
instances
have
been
known
of
their
submitting
cheerfully
to
fare
upon
fresh
fish
and
for
a
whole
winter
when
cut
off
from
other
supplies
it
was
a
common
saying
keep
an
engagé
to
his
corn
and
tallow
he
will
serve
you
well
give
him
pork
and
bread
and
he
soon
gets
beyond
your
management
they
regard
the
terms
of
their
engagement
as
binding
to
the
letter
an
old
trader
berthelet
engaged
a
crew
at
montreal
the
terms
of
agreement
were
that
they
should
eat
when
their
bourgeois
did
and
what
he
did
it
was
a
piece
of
fun
on
the
part
of
the
old
gentleman
but
the
simple
canadians
believed
it
to
be
a
signal
instance
of
good
luck
that
had
provided
them
such
luxurious
prospects
the
bourgeois
stuffed
his
pockets
with
crackers
and
when
sure
of
being
quite
unobserved
would
slily
eat
one
pipe
after
pipe
passed
the
men
grew
hungry
but
observing
that
there
were
no
preparations
of
a
meal
for
the
bourgeois
they
bore
their
fast
without
complaining
at
length
the
matter
became
too
serious
they
could
stand
it
no
longer
in
their
distress
they
begged
off
from
the
bargain
and
gladly
compounded
to
take
the
customary
rations
instead
of
the
dainty
fare
they
had
been
promising
themselves
with
their
master
on
arriving
at
mackinac
which
was
the
entrepôt
of
the
fur
trade
a
small
proportion
of
the
voyageur
wages
was
advanced
him
to
furnish
his
winter
outfit
his
pipes
and
tobacco
his
needles
and
thread
some
pieces
of
ribbons
and
red
and
yellow
gartering
quality
binding
with
which
to
purchase
their
little
necessaries
from
the
indians
to
these
if
his
destination
were
lake
superior
or
a
post
far
to
the
north
where
such
articles
could
not
be
readily
obtained
were
added
one
or
two
smoked
for
moccasins
thus
equipped
he
entered
upon
his
three
years
service
to
toil
by
day
and
laugh
joke
sing
and
tell
stories
when
the
evening
hour
brought
rest
and
liberty
there
was
not
wanting
here
and
there
an
instance
of
obstinate
adherence
to
the
exact
letter
of
the
agreement
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
employment
although
as
a
general
thing
the
engagé
held
himself
ready
to
fulfil
the
behests
of
his
bourgeois
as
faithfully
as
ever
did
vassal
those
of
his
chief
a
story
is
told
of
jean
a
trader
on
the
upper
mississippi
who
upon
a
certain
occasion
ordered
one
of
his
frenchmen
to
accompany
a
party
to
the
forest
to
chop
wood
the
man
refused
he
was
not
hired
he
said
to
chop
wood
ah
for
what
then
were
you
hired
to
steer
a
boat
very
well
steer
a
boat
then
since
you
prefer
it
it
was
the
recusant
was
marched
to
the
and
placed
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
which
lay
fastened
in
the
ice
after
serving
a
couple
of
hours
at
his
legitimate
employment
with
the
thermometer
below
zero
he
was
quite
content
to
take
his
place
with
the
and
never
again
thought
it
good
policy
to
choose
work
for
himself
there
is
an
aristocracy
in
the
voyageur
service
which
is
quite
amusing
the
engagement
is
usually
made
for
three
years
the
engagé
of
the
first
year
who
is
called
a
or
is
looked
down
upon
with
the
most
sovereign
contempt
by
an
or
one
who
has
already
passed
a
winter
in
the
country
he
will
not
only
not
associate
with
him
but
if
invited
by
him
to
join
him
in
a
friendly
glass
he
will
make
some
excuse
for
declining
the
most
inveterate
drunkard
while
tortured
by
a
longing
to
partake
his
favorite
indulgence
will
yet
never
suffer
himself
to
be
enticed
into
an
infringement
of
this
custom
after
the
first
winter
the
rises
from
his
freshman
class
and
takes
his
place
where
he
can
in
turn
lord
it
over
all
another
peculiarity
of
the
voyageurs
is
their
fancy
for
transforming
the
names
of
their
bourgeois
into
something
funny
which
resembles
it
in
sound
thus
kinzie
would
be
called
by
one
fifteen
noses
by
another
monkeyfied
kercheval
was
denominated
short
horse
the
judge
of
probate
juge
too
foolish
etc
the
following
is
an
instance
in
point
shaw
one
of
the
agents
of
the
northwest
fur
company
had
passed
many
years
on
the
frontier
and
was
by
the
voyageurs
called
monsieur
le
chat
on
quitting
the
indian
country
he
married
a
canadian
lady
and
became
the
father
of
several
children
some
years
after
his
return
to
canada
his
old
foreman
named
louis
la
liberté
went
to
montreal
to
spend
the
winter
he
had
heard
of
his
old
bourgeois
marriage
and
was
anxious
to
see
him
shaw
was
walking
in
the
champ
de
mars
with
a
couple
of
officers
when
la
liberté
espied
him
he
immediately
ran
up
and
seizing
him
by
both
hands
accosted
him
mon
cher
monsieur
le
chat
comment

dear
cat

how

was
too
much
for
shaw
he
answered
shortly
that
the
were
all
and
turned
away
with
his
military
friends
leaving
poor
louizon
quite
astonished
at
the
abruptness
of
his
departure
cut
off
in
the
manner
described
from
the
world
at
large
with
no
society
but
the
military
thus
lived
the
family
of
kinzie
in
great
contentment
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
comforts
together
with
most
of
the
luxuries
of
life
the
indians
reciprocated
the
friendship
that
was
shown
them
and
formed
for
them
an
attachment
of
no
ordinary
strength
as
was
manifested
during
the
scenes
of
the
year
eight
years
after
kinzie
first
came
to
live
among
them
some
of
the
most
prominent
events
of
that
year
are
recorded
in
the
following
narrative
chapter
xviii
massacre
at
chicago
it
was
the
evening
of
the
of
april
the
children
of
kinzie
were
dancing
before
the
fire
to
the
music
of
their
father
violin
the
was
spread
and
they
were
awaiting
the
return
of
their
mother
who
had
gone
to
visit
a
sick
neighbor
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
river
suddenly
their
sports
were
interrupted
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
kinzie
rushed
in
pale
with
terror
and
scarcely
able
to
articulate
the
indians
the
indians
the
indians
what
where
eagerly
demanded
they
all
up
at
lee
place
killing
and
scalping
with
difficulty
kinzie
composed
herself
sufficiently
to
give
the
information
that
while
she
was
up
at
burns
a
man
and
a
boy
were
seen
running
down
with
all
speed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
that
they
had
called
across
to
give
notice
to
barns
family
to
save
themselves
for
were
at
lee
place
from
which
they
had
just
made
their
escape
having
given
this
terrifying
news
they
had
made
all
speed
for
the
fort
which
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
that
they
then
were
all
was
now
consternation
and
dismay
the
family
were
hurried
into
two
old
that
lay
moored
near
the
house
and
paddled
with
all
possible
haste
across
the
river
to
take
refuge
in
the
fort
all
that
the
man
and
boy
who
had
made
their
escape
were
able
to
tell
was
soon
known
but
in
order
to
render
their
story
more
intelligible
it
is
necessary
to
describe
the
scene
of
action
since
known
by
the
name
of
hardscrabble
was
a
farm
intersected
by
the
chicago
river
about
four
miles
from
its
mouth
the
stood
on
the
western
bank
of
the
south
branch
of
this
river
on
the
north
side
of
the
main
stream
but
quite
near
its
junction
with
lake
michigan
stood
as
has
already
been
described
the
and
of
kinzie
the
fort
was
situated
on
the
southern
bank
directly
opposite
this
mansion
the
river
and
a
few
rods
of
sloping
green
turf
on
either
side
being
all
that
intervened
between
them
the
fort
was
differently
constructed
from
the
one
erected
on
the
same
site
in
it
had
two
on
the
southern
side
and
on
the
northern
a
or
subterranean
passage
from
the
to
the
river
this
was
designed
either
to
facilitate
escape
in
case
of
an
emergency
or
as
a
means
of
supplying
the
garrison
with
water
during
a
siege
the
officers
in
the
fort
at
this
period
were
captain
heald
the
commanding
officer
lieutenant
helm
the
of
kinzie
and
ensign
ronan
the
two
last
were
very
young
men
and
the
surgeon
van
voorhees
the
command
numbered
about
men
very
few
of
whom
were
effective
a
constant
and
friendly
intercourse
had
been
maintained
between
these
troops
and
the
indians
it
is
true
that
the
principal
men
of
the
pottowattamie
nation
like
those
of
most
other
tribes
went
yearly
to
fort
malden
in
canada
to
receive
a
large
amount
of
presents
with
which
the
british
government
had
for
many
years
been
in
the
habit
of
purchasing
their
alliance
and
it
was
well
known
that
many
of
the
pottowattamies
as
well
as
winnebagoes
had
been
engaged
with
the
ottawas
and
shawnees
at
the
battle
of
tippecanoe
the
preceding
autumn
yet
as
the
principal
chiefs
of
all
the
bands
in
the
neighborhood
appeared
to
be
on
the
most
amicable
terms
with
the
americans
no
interruption
of
their
harmony
was
at
any
time
anticipated
after
the
of
august
however
many
circumstances
were
recollected
that
might
have
opened
the
eyes
of
the
whites
had
they
not
been
lulled
in
a
fatal
security
one
instance
in
particular
may
be
mentioned
in
the
spring
preceding
the
destruction
of
the
fort
two
indians
of
the
calumet
band
came
to
the
fort
on
a
visit
to
the
commanding
officer
as
they
passed
through
the
quarters
they
saw
heald
and
mrs
helm
playing
at
battledoor
turning
to
the
interpreter
one
of
them
remarked
the
white
chiefs
wives
are
amusing
themselves
very
much
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
are
hoeing
in
our
this
was
considered
at
the
time
an
idle
threat
or
at
most
an
ebullition
of
jealous
feeling
at
the
contrast
between
the
situation
of
their
own
women
and
that
of
the
white
chiefs
wives
some
months
after
how
bitterly
was
it
remembered
the
farm
at
lee
place
was
occupied
by
a
white
and
three
persons
employed
by
him
in
the
care
of
the
farm
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
our
narrative
commences
a
party
of
ten
or
twelve
indians
dressed
and
painted
arrived
at
the
house
and
according
to
the
custom
among
savages
entered
and
seated
themselves
without
ceremony
something
in
their
appearance
and
manner
excited
the
suspicions
of
one
of
the
family
a
frenchman
who
remarked
i
do
not
like
the
appearance
of
these
indians
they
are
none
of
our
folks
i
know
by
their
dress
and
paint
that
they
are
not
pottowattamies
another
of
the
family
a
discharged
soldier
then
said
to
the
boy
who
was
present
if
that
is
the
case
we
had
better
get
away
from
them
if
we
can
say
nothing
but
do
as
you
see
me
do
as
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
the
soldier
walked
leisurely
towards
the
canoes
of
which
there
were
two
tied
near
the
bank
some
of
the
indians
inquired
where
he
was
going
he
pointed
to
the
cattle
which
were
standing
among
the
haystacks
on
the
opposite
bank
and
made
signs
that
they
must
go
and
fodder
them
and
then
they
should
return
and
get
their
supper
he
got
into
one
canoe
and
the
boy
into
the
other
the
stream
was
narrow
and
they
were
soon
across
when
they
had
gained
the
opposite
side
they
pulled
some
hay
for
the
cattle
made
a
show
of
collecting
them
and
when
they
had
gradually
made
a
circuit
so
that
their
movements
were
concealed
by
the
haystacks
they
took
to
the
woods
which
were
close
at
hand
and
made
for
the
fort
they
had
run
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
they
heard
the
discharge
of
two
guns
successively
which
they
supposed
to
have
been
levelled
at
the
companions
they
had
left
behind
they
stopped
not
nor
stayed
until
they
arrived
opposite
burns
where
as
before
related
they
called
across
to
advertise
the
family
of
their
danger
and
then
hastened
on
to
the
fort
it
now
occurred
to
those
who
had
secured
their
own
safety
that
the
family
of
burns
was
at
this
moment
exposed
to
the
most
imminent
peril
the
question
was
who
would
hazard
his
own
life
to
bring
them
to
a
place
of
safety
a
gallant
young
officer
ensign
ronan
volunteered
with
a
party
of
five
or
six
soldiers
to
go
to
their
rescue
they
ascended
the
river
in
a
scow
and
took
the
mother
with
her
infant
of
scarcely
a
day
old
upon
her
bed
to
the
boat
in
which
they
carefully
conveyed
her
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
to
the
fort
a
party
of
soldiers
consisting
of
a
corporal
and
six
men
had
that
afternoon
obtained
leave
to
go
up
the
river
to
fish
they
had
not
returned
when
the
fugitives
from
lee
place
arrived
at
the
fort
and
fearing
that
they
might
encounter
the
indians
the
commanding
officer
ordered
a
cannon
to
be
fired
to
warn
them
of
danger
they
were
at
the
time
about
two
miles
above
lee
place
hearing
the
signal
they
took
the
hint
put
out
their
torches
for
it
was
now
night
and
dropped
down
the
river
towards
the
garrison
as
silently
as
possible
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
since
the
battle
of
tippecanoe
the
preceding
november
had
rendered
every
man
vigilant
and
the
slightest
alarm
was
an
admonition
to
beware
of
the
indians
when
the
reached
lee
place
it
was
proposed
to
stop
and
warn
the
inmates
to
be
upon
their
guard
as
the
signal
from
the
fort
indicated
danger
of
some
kind
all
was
still
as
death
around
the
house
they
groped
their
way
along
and
as
the
corporal
jumped
over
the
small
enclosure
he
placed
his
hand
upon
the
dead
body
of
a
man
by
the
sense
of
touch
he
soon
ascertained
that
the
head
was
without
a
scalp
and
otherwise
mutilated
the
faithful
dog
of
the
murdered
man
stood
guarding
the
lifeless
remains
of
his
master
the
tale
was
now
told
the
men
retreated
to
their
canoes
and
reached
the
fort
unmolested
about
eleven
at
night
the
next
morning
a
party
of
the
citizens
and
soldiers
volunteered
to
go
to
lee
place
to
learn
further
the
fate
of
its
occupants
the
body
of
white
was
found
pierced
by
two
balls
and
with
eleven
stabs
in
the
breast
the
frenchman
as
already
described
lay
dead
with
his
dog
still
beside
him
their
bodies
were
brought
to
the
fort
and
buried
in
its
immediate
vicinity
it
was
subsequently
ascertained
from
traders
out
in
the
indian
country
that
the
perpetrators
of
this
bloody
deed
were
a
party
of
winnebagoes
who
had
come
into
this
neighborhood
to
take
some
white
scalps
their
plan
had
been
to
proceed
down
the
river
from
lee
place
and
kill
every
white
man
without
the
walls
of
the
fort
hearing
however
the
report
of
the
cannon
and
not
knowing
what
it
portended
they
thought
it
best
to
remain
satisfied
with
this
one
exploit
and
forthwith
retreated
to
their
homes
on
rock
river
the
inhabitants
outside
the
fort
consisting
of
a
few
discharged
soldiers
and
some
families
of
now
intrenched
themselves
in
the
agency
house
this
stood
west
of
the
fort
between
the
pickets
and
the
river
and
distant
about
twenty
rods
from
the
former
it
was
an
log
building
with
a
hall
running
through
the
centre
and
one
large
room
on
each
side
piazzas
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
building
in
front
and
rear
these
were
planked
up
for
greater
security
were
cut
and
sentinels
posted
at
night
as
the
enemy
were
believed
to
be
lurking
still
in
the
neighborhood
or
emboldened
by
former
success
likely
to
return
at
any
moment
an
order
was
issued
prohibiting
any
soldier
or
citizen
from
leaving
the
vicinity
of
the
garrison
without
a
guard
one
night
a
sergeant
and
private
who
were
out
on
a
patrol
came
suddenly
upon
a
party
of
indians
in
the
pasture
adjoining
the
esplanade
the
sergeant
fired
his
piece
and
both
retreated
towards
the
fort
before
they
could
reach
it
an
indian
threw
his
tomahawk
which
missed
the
sergeant
and
struck
a
wagon
standing
near
the
sentinel
from
the
immediately
fired
and
with
effect
while
the
men
got
safely
in
the
next
morning
it
was
ascertained
from
traces
of
blood
to
a
considerable
distance
into
the
prairie
and
from
the
appearance
of
a
body
having
been
laid
among
the
long
grass
that
some
execution
had
been
done
on
another
occasion
the
enemy
entered
the
esplanade
to
steal
horses
not
finding
them
in
the
stable
as
they
had
expected
they
made
themselves
amends
for
their
disappointment
by
stabbing
all
the
sheep
in
the
stable
and
then
letting
them
loose
the
poor
animals
flocked
towards
the
fort
this
gave
the
alarm
the
garrison
was
aroused
parties
were
sent
out
but
the
marauders
escaped
unmolested
the
inmates
of
the
fort
experienced
no
farther
alarm
for
many
weeks
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
august
winnemeg
or
a
pottowattamie
chief
arrived
at
the
post
bringing
despatches
from
general
hull
these
announced
the
declaration
of
war
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
that
general
hull
at
the
head
of
the
northwestern
army
had
arrived
at
detroit
also
that
the
island
of
mackinac
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
british
the
orders
to
captain
heald
were
to
evacuate
the
fort
if
practicable
and
in
that
event
to
distribute
all
the
united
states
property
contained
in
the
fort
and
in
the
united
states
factory
or
agency
among
the
indians
in
the
neighborhood
after
having
delivered
his
despatches
winnemeg
requested
a
private
interview
with
kinzie
who
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
the
fort
he
stated
to
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
purport
of
the
communications
he
had
brought
and
begged
him
to
ascertain
if
it
were
the
intention
of
captain
heald
to
evacuate
the
post
he
advised
strongly
against
such
a
step
inasmuch
as
the
garrison
was
well
supplied
with
ammunition
and
with
provisions
for
six
months
it
would
therefore
be
far
better
he
thought
to
remain
until
a
reinforcement
could
be
sent
to
their
assistance
if
however
captain
heald
should
decide
upon
leaving
the
post
it
should
by
all
means
be
done
immediately
the
pottowattamies
through
whose
country
they
must
pass
being
ignorant
of
the
object
of
winnemeg
mission
a
forced
march
might
be
made
before
those
who
were
hostile
in
their
feelings
were
prepared
to
interrupt
them
of
this
advice
so
earnestly
given
captain
heald
was
immediately
informed
he
replied
that
it
was
his
intention
to
evacuate
the
post
but
that
inasmuch
as
he
had
received
orders
to
distribute
the
united
states
property
he
should
not
feel
justified
in
leaving
it
until
he
had
collected
the
indians
of
the
neighborhood
and
made
an
equitable
division
among
them
winnemeg
then
suggested
the
expediency
of
marching
out
and
leaving
all
things
standing
possibly
while
the
indians
were
engaged
in
the
partition
of
the
spoils
the
troops
might
effect
their
retreat
unmolested
this
advice
was
strongly
seconded
by
kinzie
but
did
not
meet
the
approbation
of
the
commanding
officer
the
order
for
evacuating
the
post
was
read
next
morning
upon
parade
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
captain
heald
in
such
an
emergency
omitted
the
usual
form
of
calling
a
council
of
war
with
his
officers
it
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
of
a
want
of
harmonious
feeling
between
himself
and
one
of
his
junior
officers
ensign
ronan
a
and
somewhat
overbearing
but
brave
and
generous
young
man
in
the
course
of
the
day
finding
that
no
council
was
called
the
officers
waited
on
captain
heald
to
be
informed
what
course
he
intended
to
pursue
when
they
learned
his
intentions
they
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
following
grounds
first
it
was
highly
improbable
that
the
command
would
be
permitted
to
pass
through
the
country
in
safety
to
fort
wayne
for
although
it
had
been
said
that
some
of
the
chiefs
had
opposed
an
attack
upon
the
fort
planned
the
preceding
autumn
yet
it
was
well
known
that
they
had
been
actuated
in
that
matter
by
motives
of
private
regard
to
one
family
that
of
kinzie
and
not
to
any
general
friendly
feeling
towards
the
americans
and
that
at
any
rate
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
these
few
individuals
would
be
able
to
control
the
whole
tribe
who
were
thirsting
for
blood
in
the
next
place
their
march
must
necessarily
be
slow
as
their
movements
must
be
accommodated
to
the
helplessness
of
the
women
and
children
of
whom
there
were
a
number
with
the
detachment
that
of
their
small
force
some
of
the
soldiers
were
superannuated
others
invalid
therefore
since
the
course
to
be
pursued
was
left
discretional
their
unanimous
advice
was
to
remain
where
they
were
and
fortify
themselves
as
strongly
as
possible
succors
from
the
other
side
of
the
peninsula
might
arrive
before
they
could
be
attacked
by
the
british
from
mackinac
and
even
should
they
not
it
were
far
better
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
latter
than
to
become
the
victims
of
the
savages
captain
heald
argued
in
reply
that
a
special
order
had
been
issued
by
the
war
department
that
no
post
should
be
surrendered
without
battle
having
been
given
and
his
force
was
totally
inadequate
to
an
engagement
with
the
indians
that
he
should
unquestionably
be
censured
for
remaining
when
there
appeared
a
prospect
of
a
safe
march
through
and
that
upon
the
whole
he
deemed
it
expedient
to
assemble
the
indians
distribute
the
property
among
them
and
then
ask
of
them
an
escort
to
fort
wayne
with
the
promise
of
a
considerable
reward
upon
their
safe
arrival
adding
that
he
had
full
confidence
in
the
friendly
professions
of
the
indians
from
whom
as
well
as
from
the
soldiers
the
capture
of
mackinac
had
been
kept
a
profound
secret
from
this
time
the
officers
held
themselves
aloof
and
spoke
but
little
upon
the
subject
though
they
considered
the
project
of
captain
heald
little
short
of
madness
the
dissatisfaction
among
the
soldiers
hourly
increased
until
it
reached
a
high
pitch
of
insubordination
upon
one
occasion
as
captain
heald
was
conversing
with
kinzie
upon
the
parade
he
remarked
i
could
not
remain
even
if
i
thought
it
best
for
i
have
but
a
small
store
of
provisions
why
captain
said
a
soldier
who
stood
near
forgetting
all
etiquette
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
you
have
cattle
enough
to
last
the
troops
six
months
but
replied
captain
heald
i
have
no
salt
to
preserve
it
with
then
jerk
it
said
the
man
as
the
indians
do
their
venison
the
indians
now
became
daily
more
unruly
entering
the
fort
in
defiance
of
the
sentinels
they
made
their
way
without
ceremony
into
the
officers
quarters
on
one
occasion
an
indian
took
up
a
rifle
and
fired
it
in
the
parlor
of
the
commanding
officer
as
an
expression
of
defiance
some
were
of
opinion
that
this
was
intended
among
the
young
men
as
a
signal
for
an
attack
the
old
chiefs
passed
backwards
and
forwards
among
the
assembled
groups
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
lively
agitation
while
the
squaws
rushed
to
and
fro
in
great
excitement
and
evidently
prepared
for
some
fearful
scene
any
further
manifestation
of
ill
feeling
was
however
suppressed
for
the
present
and
captain
heald
strange
as
it
may
seem
continued
to
entertain
a
conviction
of
having
created
so
amicable
a
disposition
among
the
indians
as
would
insure
the
safety
of
the
command
on
their
march
to
fort
wayne
thus
passed
the
time
until
the
of
august
the
feelings
of
the
inmates
of
the
fort
during
this
time
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
each
morning
that
dawned
seemed
to
bring
them
nearer
to
that
most
appalling
fate
butchery
by
a
savage
foe
and
at
night
they
scarcely
dared
yield
to
slumber
lest
they
should
be
aroused
by
the
and
tomahawk
gloom
and
mistrust
prevailed
and
the
want
of
unanimity
among
the
officers
debarred
them
the
consolation
they
might
have
found
in
mutual
sympathy
and
encouragement
the
indians
being
assembled
from
the
neighboring
villages
a
council
was
held
with
them
on
the
afternoon
of
the
captain
heald
alone
attended
on
the
part
of
the
military
he
requested
his
officers
to
accompany
him
but
they
declined
they
had
been
secretly
informed
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
young
chiefs
to
fall
upon
the
officers
and
massacre
them
while
in
council
but
they
could
not
persuade
captain
heald
of
the
truth
of
their
information
they
waited
therefore
only
until
he
had
left
the
garrison
accompanied
by
kinzie
when
they
took
command
of
the
which
overlooked
the
esplanade
on
which
the
council
was
held
opened
the
and
pointed
the
cannon
so
as
to
command
the
whole
assembly
by
this
means
probably
the
lives
of
the
whites
who
were
present
in
council
were
preserved
in
council
the
commanding
officer
informed
the
indians
that
it
was
his
intention
to
distribute
among
them
the
next
day
not
only
the
goods
lodged
in
the
united
states
factory
but
also
the
ammunition
and
provisions
with
which
the
garrison
was
well
supplied
he
then
requested
of
the
pottowattamies
an
escort
to
fort
wayne
promising
them
a
liberal
reward
on
arriving
there
in
addition
to
the
presents
they
were
now
about
to
receive
with
many
professions
of
friendship
and
good
will
the
savages
assented
to
all
be
proposed
and
promised
all
he
required
after
the
council
kinzie
who
understood
well
not
only
the
indian
character
but
the
present
tone
of
feeling
among
them
had
a
long
interview
with
captain
heald
in
hopes
of
opening
his
eyes
to
the
present
posture
of
affairs
he
reminded
him
that
since
the
troubles
with
the
indians
upon
the
wabash
and
its
vicinity
there
had
appeared
a
settled
plan
of
hostilities
towards
the
whites
in
consequence
of
which
it
had
been
the
policy
of
the
americans
to
withhold
from
them
whatever
would
enable
them
to
carry
on
their
warfare
upon
the
defenceless
inhabitants
of
the
frontier
kinzie
also
recalled
to
captain
heald
how
that
having
left
home
for
detroit
the
preceding
autumn
on
receiving
when
he
had
proceeded
as
far
as
de
charme
the
intelligence
of
the
battle
of
tippecanoe
he
had
immediately
returned
to
chicago
that
he
might
dispatch
orders
to
his
traders
to
furnish
no
ammunition
to
the
indians
in
consequence
of
which
all
they
had
on
hand
was
secreted
and
such
of
the
traders
as
had
not
already
started
for
their
took
neither
powder
nor
shot
with
them
captain
heald
was
struck
with
the
impolicy
of
furnishing
the
enemy
for
such
they
must
now
consider
their
old
neighbors
with
arms
against
himself
and
determined
to
destroy
all
the
ammunition
except
what
should
be
necessary
for
the
use
of
his
own
troops
on
the
the
goods
consisting
of
blankets
broadcloths
calicoes
paints
were
distributed
as
stipulated
the
same
evening
the
ammunition
and
liquor
were
carried
part
into
the
and
thrown
into
a
well
which
had
been
dug
there
to
supply
the
garrison
with
water
in
case
of
emergency
the
remainder
was
transported
as
secretly
as
possible
through
the
northern
gate
the
heads
of
the
barrels
knocked
in
and
the
contents
poured
into
the
river
the
same
fate
was
shared
by
a
large
quantity
of
alcohol
belonging
to
kinzie
which
had
been
deposited
in
a
warehouse
near
his
residence
opposite
the
fort
the
indians
suspected
what
was
going
on
and
crept
as
near
the
scene
of
action
as
possible
but
a
vigilant
watch
was
kept
up
and
no
one
was
suffered
to
approach
but
those
engaged
in
the
affair
all
the
muskets
not
necessary
for
the
command
on
the
march
were
broken
up
and
thrown
into
the
well
together
with
the
bags
of
shot
flints
gunscrews
and
in
short
everything
relating
to
weapons
of
offence
some
relief
to
the
general
feeling
of
despondency
was
afforded
by
the
arrival
on
the
of
august
of
captain
wells
with
fifteen
friendly
miamis
of
this
brave
man
who
forms
so
conspicuous
a
figure
in
our
frontier
annals
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
say
more
than
that
he
had
been
residing
from
his
boyhood
among
the
indians
and
consequently
possessed
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
character
and
habits
he
had
heard
at
fort
wayne
of
the
order
for
evacuating
the
fort
at
chicago
and
knowing
the
hostile
determination
of
the
pottowattamies
he
had
made
a
rapid
march
across
the
country
to
prevent
the
exposure
of
his
relative
captain
heald
and
his
troops
to
certain
destruction
but
he
came
all
too
late
when
he
reached
the
post
he
found
that
the
ammunition
had
been
destroyed
and
the
provisions
given
to
the
indians
there
was
therefore
now
no
alternative
and
every
preparation
was
made
for
the
march
of
the
troops
on
the
following
morning
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
a
second
council
was
held
with
the
indians
they
expressed
great
indignation
at
the
destruction
of
the
ammunition
and
liquor
notwithstanding
the
precautions
that
had
been
taken
to
preserve
secrecy
the
noise
of
knocking
in
the
heads
of
the
barrels
had
betrayed
the
operations
of
the
preceding
night
indeed
so
great
was
the
quantity
of
liquor
thrown
into
the
river
that
the
taste
of
the
water
the
next
morning
was
as
one
expressed
it
strong
grog
murmurs
and
threats
were
everywhere
heard
among
the
savages
it
was
evident
that
the
first
moment
of
exposure
would
subject
the
troops
to
some
manifestation
of
their
disappointment
and
resentment
among
the
chiefs
were
several
who
although
they
shared
the
general
hostile
feeling
of
their
tribe
towards
the
americans
yet
retained
a
personal
regard
for
the
troops
at
this
post
and
for
the
few
white
citizens
of
the
place
these
chiefs
exerted
their
utmost
influence
to
allay
the
revengeful
feelings
of
the
young
men
and
to
avert
their
sanguinary
designs
but
without
effect
on
the
evening
succeeding
the
council
a
conspicuous
chief
entered
the
quarters
of
the
commanding
officer
father
said
he
i
come
to
deliver
up
to
you
the
medal
i
wear
it
was
given
me
by
the
americans
and
i
have
long
worn
it
in
token
of
our
mutual
friendship
but
our
young
men
are
resolved
to
imbrue
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
whites
i
can
not
restrain
them
and
i
will
not
wear
a
token
of
peace
while
i
am
compelled
to
act
as
an
enemy
had
further
evidence
been
wanting
this
circumstance
would
have
sufficiently
proved
to
the
devoted
band
the
justice
of
their
melancholy
anticipations
nevertheless
they
went
steadily
on
with
the
necessary
preparations
and
amid
the
horrors
of
their
situation
there
were
not
wanting
gallant
hearts
who
strove
to
encourage
in
their
desponding
companions
the
hopes
of
escape
they
were
far
from
indulging
themselves
of
the
ammunition
there
had
been
reserved
but
rounds
besides
one
box
of
cartridges
contained
in
the
this
must
under
any
circumstances
of
danger
have
proved
an
inadequate
supply
but
the
prospect
of
a
fatiguing
march
in
their
present
ineffective
state
forbade
the
troops
embarrassing
themselves
with
a
larger
quantity

narrative
of
the
massacre
continued
the
morning
of
the
arrived
all
things
were
in
readiness
and
nine
was
the
hour
named
for
starting
kinzie
having
volunteered
to
accompany
the
troops
in
their
march
had
intrusted
his
family
to
the
care
of
some
friendly
indians
who
promised
to
convey
them
in
a
boat
around
the
head
of
lake
michigan
to
a
point
on
the
joseph
river
there
to
be
joined
by
the
troops
should
the
prosecution
of
their
march
be
permitted
them
early
in
the
morning
kinzie
received
a
message
from
a
chief
of
the
joseph
band
informing
him
that
mischief
was
intended
by
the
pottowattamies
who
had
engaged
to
escort
the
detachment
and
urging
him
to
relinquish
his
design
of
accompanying
the
troops
by
land
promising
him
that
the
boat
containing
himself
and
family
should
be
permitted
to
pass
in
safety
to
joseph
kinzie
declined
acceding
to
this
proposal
as
he
believed
that
his
presence
might
operate
as
a
restraint
upon
the
fury
of
the
savages
so
warmly
were
the
greater
part
of
them
attached
to
himself
and
his
family
the
party
in
the
boat
consisted
of
kinzie
and
her
four
younger
children
their
nurse
josette
a
clerk
of
kinzie
two
servants
and
the
boatmen
besides
the
two
indians
who
acted
as
their
protectors
the
boat
started
but
had
scarcely
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
it
will
be
recollected
was
here
half
a
mile
below
the
fort
when
another
messenger
from
arrived
to
detain
them
where
they
were
there
was
no
mistaking
the
reason
of
this
detention
in
breathless
anxiety
sat
the
wife
and
mother
she
was
a
woman
of
uncommon
energy
and
strength
of
character
yet
her
heart
died
within
her
as
she
folded
her
arms
around
her
helpless
infants
and
gazed
upon
the
march
of
her
husband
and
eldest
child
to
certain
destruction
as
the
troops
left
the
fort
the
band
struck
up
the
dead
march
on
they
came
in
military
array
but
with
solemn
mien
captain
wells
took
the
lead
at
the
head
of
his
little
band
of
miamis
he
had
blackened
his
face
before
leaving
the
garrison
in
token
of
his
impending
fate
they
took
their
route
along
the
lake
shore
when
they
reached
the
point
where
commenced
a
range
of
intervening
between
the
prairie
and
the
beach
the
escort
of
pottowattamies
in
number
about
five
hundred
kept
the
level
of
the
prairie
instead
of
continuing
along
the
beach
with
the
americans
and
miamis
they
had
marched
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
when
captain
wells
who
had
kept
somewhat
in
advance
with
his
miamis
came
riding
furiously
back
they
are
about
to
attack
us
shouted
he
form
instantly
and
charge
upon
them
scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
when
a
volley
was
showered
from
among
the
the
troops
were
hastily
brought
into
line
and
charged
up
the
bank
one
man
a
veteran
of
seventy
winters
fell
as
they
ascended
the
remainder
of
the
scene
is
best
described
in
the
words
of
an
and
participator
in
the
tragedy
mrs
helm
the
wife
of
captain
then
lieutenant
helm
and
of
kinzie
after
we
had
left
the
bank
the
firing
became
general
the
miamis
fled
at
the
outset
their
chief
rode
up
to
the
pottowattamies
and
said
have
deceived
the
americans
and
us
you
have
done
a
bad
action
and
brandishing
his
tomahawk
i
will
be
the
first
to
head
a
party
of
americans
to
return
and
punish
your
treachery
so
saying
he
galloped
after
his
companions
who
were
now
scouring
across
the
prairies
the
troops
behaved
most
gallantly
they
were
but
a
handful
but
they
seemed
resolved
to
sell
their
lives
as
dearly
as
possible
our
horses
pranced
and
bounded
and
could
hardly
be
restrained
as
the
balls
whistled
among
them
i
drew
off
a
little
and
gazed
upon
my
husband
and
father
who
were
yet
unharmed
i
felt
that
my
hour
was
come
and
endeavored
to
forget
those
i
loved
and
prepare
myself
for
my
approaching
fate
while
i
was
thus
engaged
the
surgeon
van
voorhees
came
up
he
was
badly
wounded
his
horse
had
been
shot
under
him
and
he
had
received
a
ball
in
his
leg
every
muscle
of
his
face
was
quivering
with
the
agony
of
terror
he
said
to
me
you
think
they
will
take
our
lives
i
am
badly
wounded
but
i
think
not
mortally
perhaps
we
might
purchase
our
lives
by
promising
them
a
large
reward
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
van
voorhees
said
i
not
let
us
waste
the
few
moments
that
yet
remain
to
us
in
such
vain
hopes
our
fate
is
inevitable
in
a
few
moments
we
must
appear
before
the
bar
of
god
let
us
make
what
preparation
is
yet
in
our
power
i
can
not
die
exclaimed
he
am
not
fit
to
die
if
i
had
but
a
short
time
to
prepare
death
is
awful
i
pointed
to
ensign
ronan
who
though
mortally
wounded
and
nearly
down
was
still
fighting
with
desperation
on
one
knee
at
that
man
said
i
least
he
dies
like
a
soldier
replied
the
unfortunate
man
with
a
convulsive
gasp
he
has
no
terrors
of
the
future
he
is
an
unbeliever
at
this
moment
a
young
indian
raised
his
tomahawk
at
me
by
springing
aside
i
partially
avoided
the
blow
which
was
intended
for
my
skull
but
which
alighted
on
my
shoulder
i
seized
him
around
the
neck
and
while
exerting
my
utmost
efforts
to
get
possession
of
his
which
hung
in
a
scabbard
over
his
breast
i
was
dragged
from
his
grasp
by
another
and
older
indian
the
latter
bore
me
struggling
and
resisting
towards
the
lake
notwithstanding
the
rapidity
with
which
i
was
harried
along
i
recognized
as
i
passed
them
the
lifeless
remains
of
the
unfortunate
surgeon
some
murderous
tomahawk
had
stretched
him
upon
the
very
spot
where
i
had
last
seen
him
i
was
immediately
plunged
into
the
water
and
held
there
with
a
forcible
hand
notwithstanding
my
resistance
i
soon
perceived
however
that
the
object
of
my
captor
was
not
to
drown
me
for
he
held
me
firmly
in
such
a
position
as
to
place
my
head
above
water
this
reassured
me
and
regarding
him
attentively
i
soon
recognized
in
spite
of
the
paint
with
which
he
was
disguised
black
when
the
firing
had
nearly
subsided
my
preserver
bore
me
from
the
water
and
conducted
me
up
the
it
was
a
burning
august
morning
and
walking
through
the
sand
in
my
drenched
condition
was
inexpressibly
painful
and
fatiguing
i
stooped
and
took
off
my
shoes
to
free
them
from
the
sand
with
which
they
were
nearly
filled
when
a
squaw
seized
and
carried
them
off
and
i
was
obliged
to
proceed
without
them
when
we
had
gained
the
prairie
i
was
met
by
my
father
who
told
me
that
my
husband
was
safe
and
but
slightly
wounded
they
led
me
gently
back
towards
the
chicago
river
along
the
southern
bank
of
which
was
the
pottowattamie
encampment
at
one
time
i
was
placed
upon
a
horse
without
a
saddle
but
finding
the
motion
insupportable
i
sprang
off
supported
partly
by
my
kind
conductor
and
partly
by
another
indian
who
held
dangling
in
his
hand
a
scalp
which
by
the
black
ribbon
around
the
queue
i
recognized
as
that
of
captain
wells
i
dragged
my
fainting
steps
to
one
of
the
wigwams
the
wife
of
a
chief
from
the
illinois
river
was
standing
near
and
seeing
my
exhausted
condition
she
seized
a
kettle
dipped
up
some
water
from
a
stream
that
flowed
near
threw
into
it
some
and
stirring
it
up
with
her
hand
gave
it
me
to
drink
this
act
of
kindness
in
the
midst
of
so
many
horrors
touched
me
most
sensibly
but
my
attention
was
soon
diverted
to
other
objects
the
fort
had
become
a
scene
of
plunder
to
such
as
remained
after
the
troops
marched
out
the
cattle
had
been
shot
down
as
they
ran
at
large
and
lay
dead
or
dying
around
this
work
of
butchery
had
commenced
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
fort
i
well
remembered
a
remark
of
ensign
ronan
as
the
firing
went
on
turning
to
me
to
be
our
fate
to
be
shot
down
like
brutes
sir
said
the
commanding
officer
who
overheard
him
you
afraid
replied
the
young
man
can
march
up
to
the
enemy
where
you
dare
not
show
your
face
and
his
subsequent
gallant
behavior
showed
this
to
be
no
idle
boast
as
the
noise
of
the
firing
grew
gradually
less
and
the
stragglers
from
the
victorious
party
came
dropping
in
i
received
confirmation
of
what
my
father
had
hurriedly
communicated
in
our
on
the
lake
shore
namely
that
the
whites
had
surrendered
after
the
loss
of
about
of
their
number
they
had
stipulated
through
the
interpreter
peresh
leclerc
for
the
preservation
of
their
lives
and
those
of
the
remaining
women
and
children
and
for
their
delivery
at
some
of
the
british
posts
unless
ransomed
by
traders
in
the
indian
country
it
appears
that
the
wounded
prisoners
were
not
considered
as
included
in
the
stipulation
and
a
horrid
scene
ensued
upon
their
being
brought
into
camp
an
old
squaw
infuriated
by
the
loss
of
friends
or
excited
by
the
sanguinary
scenes
around
her
seemed
possessed
by
a
demoniac
ferocity
she
seized
a
and
assaulted
one
miserable
victim
who
lay
groaning
and
writhing
in
the
agony
of
his
wounds
aggravated
by
the
scorching
beams
of
the
sun
with
a
delicacy
of
feeling
scarcely
to
have
been
expected
under
such
circumstances
stretched
a
mat
across
two
poles
between
me
and
this
dreadful
scene
i
was
thus
spared
in
some
degree
a
view
of
its
horrors
although
i
could
not
entirely
close
my
ears
to
the
cries
of
the
sufferer
the
following
night
five
more
of
the
wounded
prisoners
were
tomahawked
the
americans
it
appears
after
their
first
attack
by
the
indians
charged
upon
those
who
had
concealed
themselves
in
a
sort
of
ravine
intervening
between
the
and
the
prairie
the
latter
gathered
themselves
into
a
body
and
after
some
hard
fighting
in
which
the
number
of
whites
had
become
reduced
to
this
little
band
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
enemy
and
gaining
a
rising
ground
not
far
from
the
oak
woods
further
contest
now
seeming
hopeless
lieutenant
helm
sent
peresh
leclerc
a
boy
in
the
service
of
kinzie
who
had
accompanied
the
detachment
and
fought
manfully
on
their
side
to
propose
terms
of
capitulation
it
was
stipulated
that
the
lives
of
all
the
survivors
should
be
spared
and
a
ransom
permitted
as
soon
as
practicable
but
in
the
mean
time
a
horrible
scene
had
been
enacted
one
young
savage
climbing
into
the
containing
the
children
of
the
white
families
twelve
in
number
tomahawked
the
entire
group
this
was
during
the
engagement
near
the
when
captain
wells
who
was
fighting
near
beheld
it
he
exclaimed
is
that
their
game
butchering
the
women
and
children
then
i
will
kill
too
so
saying
he
turned
his
horse
head
and
started
for
the
indian
camp
near
the
fort
where
had
been
left
their
squaws
and
children
several
indians
pursued
him
as
he
galloped
along
he
laid
himself
flat
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
loading
and
firing
in
that
position
as
he
would
occasionally
turn
on
his
pursuers
at
length
their
balls
took
effect
killing
his
horse
and
severely
wounding
himself
at
this
moment
he
was
met
by
and
who
endeavored
to
save
him
from
the
savages
who
had
now
overtaken
him
as
they
supported
him
along
after
having
disengaged
him
from
his
horse
he
received
his
from
another
indian
who
stabbed
him
in
the
back
the
heroic
resolution
of
one
of
the
soldiers
wives
deserves
to
be
recorded
she
was
a
corbin
and
had
from
the
first
expressed
the
determination
never
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
savages
believing
that
their
prisoners
were
always
subjected
to
tortures
worse
than
death
when
therefore
a
party
came
upon
her
to
make
her
a
prisoner
she
fought
with
desperation
refusing
to
surrender
although
assured
by
signs
of
safety
and
kind
treatment
and
literally
suffered
herself
to
be
cut
to
pieces
rather
than
become
their
captive
there
was
a
sergeant
holt
who
early
in
the
engagement
received
a
ball
in
the
neck
finding
himself
badly
wounded
he
gave
his
sword
to
his
wife
who
was
on
horseback
near
him
telling
her
to
defend
herself
he
then
made
for
the
lake
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
balls
holt
rode
a
very
fine
horse
which
the
indians
were
desirous
of
possessing
and
they
therefore
attacked
her
in
hopes
of
dismounting
her
they
fought
only
with
the
of
their
guns
for
their
object
was
not
to
kill
her
she
hacked
and
hewed
at
their
pieces
as
they
were
thrust
against
her
now
on
this
side
now
that
finally
she
broke
loose
from
them
and
dashed
out
into
the
prairie
the
indians
pursued
her
shouting
and
laughing
and
now
and
then
calling
out
the
brave
woman
do
not
hurt
her
at
length
they
overtook
her
again
and
while
she
was
engaged
with
two
or
three
in
front
one
succeeded
in
seizing
her
by
the
neck
behind
and
dragging
her
although
a
large
and
powerful
woman
from
her
horse
notwithstanding
that
their
guns
had
been
so
hacked
and
injured
and
even
themselves
cut
severely
they
seemed
to
regard
her
only
with
admiration
they
took
her
to
a
trader
on
the
illinois
river
by
whom
she
was
restored
to
her
friends
after
having
received
every
kindness
during
her
captivity
those
of
the
family
of
kinzie
who
had
remained
in
the
boat
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
were
carefully
guarded
by
and
another
indian
they
had
seen
the
smoke
then
the
blaze
and
immediately
after
the
report
of
the
first
tremendous
discharge
sounded
in
their
ears
then
all
was
confusion
they
realized
nothing
until
they
saw
an
indian
come
towards
them
from
the
leading
a
horse
on
which
sat
a
lady
apparently
wounded
that
is
heald
cried
kinzie
that
indian
will
kill
her
run
chandonnai
to
one
of
kinzie
clerks
take
the
mule
that
is
tied
there
and
offer
it
to
him
to
release
her
her
captor
by
this
time
was
in
the
act
of
disengaging
her
bonnet
from
her
head
in
order
to
scalp
her
chandonnai
ran
up
and
offered
the
mule
as
a
ransom
with
the
promise
of
ten
bottles
of
whiskey
as
soon
as
they
should
reach
his
village
the
latter
was
a
strong
temptation
but
said
the
indian
she
is
badly
wounded
she
will
die
will
you
give
me
the
whiskey
at
all
events
chandonnai
promised
that
he
would
and
the
bargain
was
concluded
the
savage
placed
the
lady
bonnet
on
his
own
head
and
after
an
ineffectual
effort
on
the
part
of
some
squaws
to
rob
her
of
her
shoes
and
stockings
she
was
brought
on
board
the
boat
where
she
lay
moaning
with
pain
from
the
many
she
had
received
in
both
arms
the
horse
heald
had
ridden
was
a
fine
spirited
animal
and
being
desirous
of
possessing
themselves
of
it
uninjured
the
indians
had
aimed
their
shots
so
as
to
disable
the
rider
without
injuring
her
steed
she
had
not
lain
long
in
the
boat
when
a
young
indian
of
savage
aspect
was
seen
appapproaching
buffalo
robe
was
hastily
drawn
over
her
and
she
was
admonished
to
suppress
all
sound
of
complaint
as
she
valued
her
life
the
heroic
woman
remained
perfectly
silent
while
the
savage
drew
near
he
had
a
pistol
in
his
hand
which
he
rested
on
the
side
of
the
boat
while
with
a
fearful
scowl
he
looked
pryingly
around
black
jim
one
of
the
servants
who
stood
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
seized
an
axe
that
lay
near
and
signed
to
him
that
if
he
shot
he
would
cleave
his
skull
telling
him
that
the
boat
contained
only
the
family
of
upon
this
the
indian
retired
it
afterwards
appeared
that
the
object
of
his
search
was
burnett
a
trader
from
joseph
with
whom
he
had
some
account
to
settle
when
the
boat
was
at
length
permitted
to
return
to
the
mansion
of
kinzie
and
heald
was
removed
to
the
house
it
became
necessary
to
dress
her
wounds
applied
to
an
old
chief
who
stood
by
and
who
like
most
of
his
tribe
possessed
some
skill
in
surgery
to
extract
a
ball
from
the
arm
of
the
sufferer
no
father
replied
he
i
can
not
do
it
it
makes
me
sick
here
placing
his
hand
on
his
heart
kinzie
then
performed
the
operation
himself
with
his
penknife
at
their
own
mansion
the
family
of
kinzie
were
closely
guarded
by
their
indian
friends
whose
intention
it
was
to
carry
them
to
detroit
for
security
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
remained
at
the
wigwams
of
their
captors
the
following
morning
the
work
of
plunder
being
completed
the
indians
set
fire
to
the
fort
a
very
equitable
distribution
of
the
finery
appeared
to
have
been
made
and
shawls
ribbons
and
feathers
fluttered
about
in
all
directions
the
ludicrous
appearance
of
one
young
fellow
who
had
arrayed
himself
in
a
muslin
gown
and
the
bonnet
of
one
of
the
ladies
would
under
other
circumstances
have
afforded
matter
of
amusement
black
partridge
and
with
two
other
indians
having
established
themselves
in
the
porch
of
the
building
as
sentinels
to
protect
the
family
from
any
evil
that
the
young
men
might
be
excited
to
commit
all
remained
tranquil
for
a
short
space
after
the
conflagration
very
soon
however
a
party
of
indians
from
the
wabash
made
their
appearance
these
were
decidedly
the
most
hostile
and
implacable
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
pottowattamies
being
more
remote
they
had
shared
less
than
some
of
their
brethren
in
the
kindness
of
kinzie
and
his
family
and
consequently
their
sentiments
of
regard
for
them
were
less
powerful
runners
had
been
sent
to
the
villages
to
apprise
them
of
the
intended
evacuation
of
the
post
as
well
as
of
the
plan
of
the
indians
assembled
to
attack
the
troops
thirsting
to
participate
in
such
a
scene
they
hurried
on
and
great
was
their
mortification
on
arriving
at
the
river
aux
plaines
to
meet
with
a
party
of
their
friends
having
with
them
their
chief
badly
wounded
and
to
learn
that
the
battle
was
over
the
spoils
divided
and
the
scalps
all
taken
on
arriving
at
chicago
they
blackened
their
faces
and
proceeded
towards
the
dwelling
of
kinzie
from
his
station
on
the
piazza
black
partridge
had
watched
their
approach
and
his
fears
were
particularly
awakened
for
the
safety
of
mrs
helm
kinzie
who
had
recently
come
to
the
post
and
was
personally
unknown
to
the
more
remote
indians
by
his
advice
she
was
made
to
assume
the
ordinary
dress
of
a
frenchwoman
of
the
country
namely
a
short
gown
and
petticoat
with
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
wrapped
around
her
head
in
this
disguise
she
was
conducted
by
black
partridge
himself
to
the
house
of
ouilmette
a
frenchman
with
a
wife
who
formed
a
part
of
the
establishment
of
kinzie
and
whose
dwelling
was
close
at
hand
it
so
happened
that
the
indians
came
first
to
this
house
in
their
search
for
prisoners
as
they
approached
the
inmates
fearful
that
the
fair
complexion
and
general
appearance
of
mrs
helm
might
betray
her
for
an
american
raised
a
large
feather
bed
and
placed
her
under
the
edge
of
it
upon
the
bedstead
with
her
face
to
the
wall
bisson
a
the
sister
of
ouilmette
wife
then
seated
herself
with
her
sewing
upon
the
front
of
the
bed
it
was
a
hot
day
in
august
and
the
feverish
excitement
of
fear
and
agitation
together
with
her
position
which
was
nearly
suffocating
became
so
intolerable
that
mrs
helm
at
length
entreated
to
be
released
and
given
up
to
the
indians
i
can
but
die
said
she
let
them
put
an
end
to
my
misery
at
once
bisson
replied
your
death
would
be
the
destruction
of
us
all
for
black
partridge
has
resolved
that
if
one
drop
of
the
blood
of
your
family
is
spilled
he
will
take
the
lives
of
all
concerned
in
it
even
his
nearest
friends
and
if
once
the
work
of
murder
commences
there
will
be
no
end
of
it
so
long
as
there
remains
one
white
person
or
in
the
country
this
expostulation
nerved
mrs
helm
with
fresh
resolution
the
indians
entered
and
she
could
occasionally
see
them
from
her
gliding
about
and
stealthily
inspecting
every
part
of
the
room
though
without
making
any
ostensible
search
until
apparently
satisfied
that
there
was
no
one
concealed
they
left
the
house
all
this
time
bisson
had
kept
her
seat
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
calmly
sorting
and
arranging
the
of
the
quilt
on
which
she
was
engaged
and
preserving
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
tranquillity
although
she
knew
not
but
that
the
next
moment
she
might
receive
a
tomahawk
in
her
brain
her
unquestionably
saved
the
lives
of
all
present
from
ouilmette
house
the
party
of
indians
proceeded
to
the
dwelling
of
kinzie
they
entered
the
parlor
in
which
the
family
were
assembled
with
their
faithful
protectors
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
floor
in
silence
black
partridge
perceived
from
their
moody
and
revengeful
looks
what
was
passing
in
their
minds
but
he
dared
not
remonstrate
with
them
he
only
observed
in
a
low
tone
to
we
have
endeavored
to
save
our
friends
but
it
is
in
vain
nothing
will
save
them
now
at
this
moment
a
friendly
whoop
was
heard
from
a
party
of
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
black
partridge
sprang
to
meet
their
leader
as
the
canoes
in
which
they
had
hastily
embarked
touched
the
bank
near
the
house
who
are
you
demanded
he
a
man
who
are
a
man
like
yourself
but
tell
me
you
are
meaning
tell
me
your
disposition
and
which
side
you
are
for
i
am
a
then
make
all
speed
to
the
house
your
friend
is
in
danger
and
you
alone
can
save
him
for
it
was
he
entered
the
parlor
with
a
calm
step
and
without
a
trace
of
agitation
in
his
manner
he
deliberately
took
off
his
accoutrements
and
placed
them
with
his
rifle
behind
the
door
then
saluted
the
hostile
savages
how
now
my
friends
a
to
you
i
was
told
there
were
enemies
here
but
i
am
glad
to
find
only
friends
why
have
you
blackened
your
faces
is
it
that
you
are
mourning
for
the
friends
you
have
lost
in
battle
purposely
misunderstanding
this
token
of
evil
designs
or
is
it
that
you
are
fasting
if
so
ask
our
friend
here
and
he
will
give
you
to
eat
he
is
the
indian
friend
and
never
yet
refused
them
what
they
had
need
of
thus
taken
by
surprise
the
savages
were
ashamed
to
acknowledge
their
bloody
purpose
they
therefore
said
modestly
that
they
came
to
beg
of
their
friends
some
white
cotton
in
which
to
wrap
their
dead
before
interring
them
this
was
given
to
them
with
some
other
presents
and
they
took
their
departure
peaceably
from
the
premises
along
with
kinzie
party
was
a
officer
who
had
made
his
escape
in
a
singular
manner
as
the
troops
were
about
leaving
the
fort
it
was
found
that
the
of
the
surgeon
had
strayed
off
the
griffith
was
sent
to
collect
them
and
bring
them
on
it
being
absolutely
necessary
to
recover
them
since
their
packs
contained
part
of
the
surgeon
apparatus
and
the
medicines
for
the
march
this
man
had
been
for
a
long
time
on
the
sick
report
and
for
this
reason
was
given
the
charge
of
the
baggage
instead
of
being
placed
with
the
troops
his
efforts
to
recover
the
horses
being
unsuccessful
he
was
hastening
to
rejoin
his
party
alarmed
at
some
appearances
of
disorder
and
hostile
indications
among
the
indians
when
he
was
met
and
made
prisoner
by
having
taken
from
him
his
arms
and
accoutrements
the
chief
put
him
into
a
canoe
and
paddled
him
across
the
river
bidding
him
make
for
the
woods
and
secrete
himself
this
he
did
and
the
following
day
in
the
afternoon
seeing
from
his
that
all
appeared
quiet
he
ventured
to
steal
cautiously
into
the
garden
of
ouilmette
where
he
concealed
himself
for
a
time
behind
some
at
length
he
determined
to
enter
the
house
and
accordingly
climbed
up
through
a
small
back
window
into
the
room
where
the
family
were
this
was
just
as
the
wabash
indians
had
left
the
house
of
ouilmette
for
that
of
kinzie
the
danger
of
the
sergeant
was
now
imminent
the
family
stripped
him
of
his
uniform
and
arrayed
him
in
a
suit
of
with
belt
moccasins
and
pipe
like
a
french
engagé
his
dark
complexion
and
large
black
whiskers
favored
the
disguise
the
family
were
all
ordered
to
address
him
in
french
and
although
utterly
ignorant
of
the
language
he
continued
to
pass
for
a
and
as
such
to
accompany
kinzie
and
his
family
undetected
by
his
enemies
until
they
reached
a
place
of
safety
on
the
third
day
after
the
battle
the
family
of
kinzie
with
the
clerks
of
the
establishment
were
put
into
a
boat
under
the
care
of
françois
a
interpreter
and
conveyed
to
joseph
where
they
remained
until
the
following
november
under
the
protection
of
band
they
were
then
conducted
to
detroit
under
the
escort
of
chandonnai
and
their
trusty
indian
friend
and
delivered
up
as
prisoners
of
war
to
colonel
mckee
the
british
indian
agent
kinzie
was
not
allowed
to
leave
joseph
with
his
family
his
indian
friends
insisting
on
his
remaining
and
endeavoring
to
secure
some
remnant
of
his
scattered
property
during
his
excursions
with
them
for
that
purpose
he
wore
the
costume
and
paint
of
the
tribe
in
order
to
escape
capture
and
perhaps
death
at
the
hands
of
those
who
were
still
thirsting
for
blood
in
time
however
his
anxiety
for
his
family
induced
him
to
follow
them
to
detroit
where
in
the
month
of
january
he
was
received
and
paroled
by
general
proctor
captain
and
heald
were
sent
across
the
lake
to
joseph
the
day
after
the
battle
the
former
had
received
two
wounds
the
latter
seven
in
the
engagement
lieutenant
helm
who
was
likewise
wounded
was
carried
by
some
friendly
indians
to
their
village
on
the
au
sable
and
thence
to
peoria
where
he
was
liberated
by
the
intervention
of
thomas
forsyth
the
of
kinzie
mrs
helm
accompanied
her
parents
to
joseph
where
they
resided
in
the
family
of
alexander
robinson
receiving
from
them
all
possible
kindness
and
hospitality
for
several
months
after
their
arrival
in
detroit
mrs
helm
was
joined
by
her
husband
when
they
were
both
arrested
by
order
of
the
british
commander
and
sent
on
horseback
in
the
dead
of
winter
through
canada
to
fort
george
on
the
niagara
frontier
when
they
arrived
at
that
post
there
had
been
no
official
appointed
to
receive
them
and
notwithstanding
their
long
and
fatiguing
journey
in
weather
the
most
cold
and
inclement
mrs
helm
a
delicate
woman
of
seventeen
years
was
permitted
to
sit
waiting
in
her
saddle
outside
the
gate
for
more
than
an
hour
before
the
refreshment
of
fire
or
food
or
even
the
shelter
of
a
roof
was
offered
them
when
colonel
sheaffe
who
had
been
absent
at
the
time
was
informed
of
this
brutal
inhospitality
he
expressed
the
greatest
indignation
he
waited
on
mrs
helm
immediately
apologized
in
the
most
courteous
manner
and
treated
both
her
and
lieutenant
helm
with
the
most
considerate
kindness
until
by
an
exchange
of
prisoners
they
were
liberated
and
found
means
to
reach
their
friends
in
steuben
county
captain
heald
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
an
indian
from
the
kankakee
who
had
a
strong
personal
regard
for
him
and
who
when
he
saw
the
wounded
and
enfeebled
state
of
heald
released
her
husband
that
he
might
accompany
his
wife
to
joseph
to
the
latter
place
they
were
accordingly
carried
as
has
been
related
by
chandonnai
and
his
party
in
the
mean
time
the
indian
who
had
so
nobly
released
his
prisoner
returned
to
his
village
on
the
kankakee
where
he
had
the
mortification
of
finding
that
his
conduct
had
excited
great
dissatisfaction
among
his
band
so
great
was
the
displeasure
manifested
that
he
resolved
to
make
a
journey
to
joseph
and
reclaim
his
prisoner
news
of
his
intention
being
brought
to
and
under
whose
care
the
prisoners
were
they
held
a
private
council
with
chandonnai
kinzie
and
the
principal
men
of
the
village
the
result
of
which
was
a
determination
to
send
captain
and
heald
to
the
island
of
mackinac
and
deliver
them
up
to
the
british
they
were
accordingly
put
in
a
bark
canoe
and
paddled
by
robinson
and
his
wife
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
along
the
coast
of
michigan
and
surrendered
as
prisoners
of
war
to
the
commanding
officer
at
mackinac
as
an
instance
of
the
procrastinating
spirit
of
captain
heald
it
may
be
mentioned
that
even
after
he
had
received
certain
intelligence
that
his
indian
captor
was
on
his
way
from
the
kankakee
to
joseph
to
retake
him
he
would
still
have
delayed
another
day
at
that
place
to
make
preparation
for
a
more
comfortable
journey
to
mackinac
the
soldiers
with
their
wives
and
surviving
children
were
dispersed
among
the
different
villages
of
the
pottowattamies
upon
the
illinois
wabash
rock
river
and
at
milwaukie
until
the
following
spring
when
they
were
for
the
most
part
carried
to
detroit
and
ransomed
burns
with
her
infant
became
the
prisoner
of
a
chief
who
carried
her
to
his
village
and
treated
her
with
great
kindness
his
wife
from
jealousy
of
the
favor
shown
to
the
white
woman
and
her
child
always
treated
them
with
great
hostility
on
one
occasion
she
struck
the
infant
with
a
tomahawk
and
narrowly
missed
her
aim
of
putting
an
end
to
it
altogether
they
were
not
left
long
in
the
power
of
the
old
hag
after
this
demonstration
but
on
the
first
opportunity
were
carried
to
a
place
of
safety
the
family
of
lee
had
resided
in
a
house
on
the
lake
shore
not
far
from
the
fort
lee
was
the
owner
of
lee
place
which
he
cultivated
as
a
farm
it
was
his
son
who
ran
down
with
the
discharged
soldier
to
give
the
alarm
of
indians
at
the
fort
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
april
the
father
the
son
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
fallen
victims
on
the
of
august
except
lee
and
her
young
infant
these
were
claimed
by
black
partridge
and
carried
to
his
village
on
the
au
sable
he
had
been
particularly
attached
to
a
little
girl
of
lee
about
twelve
years
of
age
this
child
had
been
placed
on
horseback
for
the
march
and
as
she
was
unaccustomed
to
the
exercise
she
was
tied
fast
to
the
saddle
lest
by
any
accident
she
should
slip
off
or
be
thrown
she
was
within
reach
of
the
balls
at
the
commencement
of
the
engagement
and
was
severely
wounded
the
horse
set
off
on
a
full
gallop
which
partly
threw
her
but
she
was
held
fast
by
the
bands
which
confined
her
and
hung
dangling
as
the
animal
ran
violently
about
in
this
state
she
was
met
by
black
partridge
who
caught
the
horse
and
disengaged
her
from
the
saddle
finding
her
so
much
wounded
that
she
could
not
recover
and
that
she
was
suffering
great
agony
he
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
her
at
once
with
his
tomahawk
he
afterwards
said
that
this
was
the
hardest
thing
he
ever
tried
to
do
but
he
did
it
because
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
suffer
he
took
the
mother
and
her
infant
to
his
village
where
he
became
warmly
attached
to
the
former
so
much
so
that
he
wished
to
marry
her
but
as
she
very
naturally
objected
he
treated
her
with
the
greatest
respect
and
consideration
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
release
her
for
he
was
in
hopes
of
prevailing
on
her
to
become
his
wife
in
the
course
of
the
winter
her
child
fell
finding
that
none
of
the
remedies
within
their
reach
were
effectual
black
partridge
proposed
to
take
the
little
one
to
chicago
where
there
was
now
a
french
trader
living
in
the
mansion
of
kinzie
and
procure
some
medical
aid
from
him
wrapping
up
his
charge
with
the
greatest
care
he
set
out
on
his
journey
when
he
arrived
at
the
residence
of
du
pin
he
entered
the
room
where
he
was
and
carefully
placed
his
burden
on
the
floor
what
have
you
there
asked
du
pin
a
young
raccoon
which
i
have
brought
you
as
a
present
was
the
reply
and
opening
the
pack
he
showed
the
little
sick
infant
when
the
trader
had
prescribed
for
its
complaint
and
black
partridge
was
about
to
return
to
his
home
he
told
his
friend
of
the
proposal
he
had
made
to
lee
to
become
his
wife
and
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
received
du
pin
entertaining
some
fears
that
the
chief
honorable
resolution
to
leave
it
to
the
lady
herself
whether
to
accept
his
addresses
or
not
might
not
hold
out
entered
at
once
into
a
negotiation
for
her
ransom
and
so
effectually
wrought
upon
the
good
feelings
of
black
partridge
that
he
consented
to
bring
his
fair
prisoner
at
once
to
chicago
that
she
might
be
restored
to
her
friends
whether
the
kind
trader
had
at
the
outset
any
other
feeling
in
the
matter
than
sympathy
and
brotherly
kindness
we
can
not
say
we
only
know
that
in
process
of
time
lee
became
madame
du
pin
and
that
the
worthy
couple
lived
together
in
great
happiness
for
many
years
after
the
fate
of
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
calumet
village
and
who
is
mentioned
in
the
early
part
of
the
narrative
deserves
to
be
recorded
daring
the
battle
of
the
of
august
the
chief
object
of
his
attack
was
one
sergeant
hays
a
man
from
whom
he
had
received
many
acts
of
kindness
after
hays
had
received
a
ball
through
the
body
this
indian
ran
up
to
him
to
tomahawk
him
when
the
sergeant
collecting
his
remaining
strength
pierced
him
through
the
body
with
his
bayonet
they
fell
together
other
indians
running
up
soon
dispatched
hays
and
it
was
not
until
then
that
his
bayonet
was
extracted
from
the
body
of
his
adversary
the
wounded
chief
was
carried
after
the
battle
to
his
village
on
the
calumet
where
he
survived
for
several
days
finding
his
end
approaching
he
called
together
his
young
men
and
enjoined
them
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
regard
the
safety
of
their
prisoners
after
his
death
and
to
take
the
lives
of
none
of
them
from
respect
to
his
memory
as
he
deserved
his
fate
from
the
hands
of
those
whose
kindness
he
had
so
ill
requited
chapter
xx
captivity
of
kinzie
an
amusing
mistake
it
had
been
a
stipulation
of
general
hull
at
the
surrender
of
detroit
which
took
place
the
day
after
the
massacre
at
chicago
that
the
inhabitants
should
be
permitted
to
remain
undisturbed
in
their
homes
accordingly
the
family
of
kinzie
took
up
their
quarters
with
their
friends
in
the
old
mansion
which
many
will
still
recollect
as
standing
on
the
northwest
corner
of
jefferson
avenue
and
wayne
street
the
feelings
of
indignation
and
sympathy
were
constantly
aroused
in
the
hearts
of
the
citizens
during
the
winter
that
ensued
they
were
almost
daily
called
upon
to
witness
the
cruelties
practised
upon
the
american
prisoners
brought
in
by
their
indian
captors
those
who
could
scarcely
drag
their
wounded
bleeding
feet
over
the
frozen
ground
were
compelled
to
dance
for
the
amusement
of
the
savages
and
these
exhibitions
sometimes
took
place
before
the
government
house
the
residence
of
colonel
mckee
some
of
the
british
officers
looked
on
from
their
windows
at
these
performances
for
the
honor
of
humanity
we
will
hope
such
instances
were
rare
everything
that
could
be
made
available
among
the
effects
of
the
citizens
was
offered
to
ransom
their
countrymen
from
the
hands
of
these
inhuman
beings
the
prisoners
brought
in
from
the
river
raisin
those
unfortunate
men
who
were
permitted
after
their
surrender
to
general
proctor
to
be
tortured
and
murdered
by
inches
by
his
savage
allies
excited
the
sympathies
and
called
for
the
action
of
the
whole
community
private
houses
were
turned
into
hospitals
and
every
one
was
forward
to
get
possession
of
as
many
as
possible
of
the
survivors
to
effect
this
even
the
articles
of
their
apparel
were
bartered
by
the
ladies
of
detroit
as
they
watched
from
their
doors
or
windows
the
miserable
victims
carried
about
for
sale
in
the
dwelling
of
kinzie
one
large
room
was
devoted
to
the
reception
of
the
sufferers
few
of
them
survived
among
those
spoken
of
as
objects
of
the
deepest
interest
were
two
young
gentlemen
of
kentucky
brothers
both
severely
wounded
and
their
wounds
aggravated
to
a
mortal
degree
by
subsequent
ill
usage
and
hardships
their
solicitude
for
each
other
and
their
exhibition
in
various
ways
of
the
most
tender
fraternal
affection
created
an
impression
never
to
be
forgotten
the
last
bargain
made
was
by
black
jim
and
one
of
the
children
who
had
permission
to
redeem
a
negro
servant
of
the
gallant
colonel
allen
with
an
old
white
horse
the
only
available
article
that
remained
among
their
possessions
a
brother
of
colonel
allen
afterwards
came
to
detroit
and
the
negro
preferred
returning
to
servitude
rather
than
remaining
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
kinzie
as
has
been
related
joined
his
family
at
detroit
in
the
month
of
january
a
short
time
after
suspicions
arose
in
the
mind
of
general
proctor
that
he
was
in
correspondence
with
general
harrison
who
was
now
at
fort
meigs
and
who
was
believed
to
be
meditating
an
advance
upon
detroit
lieutenant
watson
of
the
british
army
waited
upon
kinzie
one
day
with
an
invitation
to
the
quarters
of
general
proctor
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
saying
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
on
business
quite
unsuspicious
he
complied
with
the
invitation
when
to
his
surprise
he
was
ordered
into
confinement
and
strictly
guarded
in
the
house
of
his
former
partner
patterson
of
sandwich
finding
that
he
did
not
return
to
his
home
kinzie
informed
some
of
the
indian
chiefs
his
particular
friends
who
immediately
repaired
to
the
of
the
commanding
officer
demanded
their
friend
release
and
brought
him
back
to
his
home
after
waiting
a
time
until
a
favorable
opportunity
presented
itself
the
general
sent
a
detachment
of
dragoons
to
arrest
kinzie
they
had
succeeded
in
carrying
him
away
and
crossing
the
river
with
him
just
at
this
moment
a
party
of
friendly
indians
made
their
appearance
where
is
the
was
the
first
question
there
replied
his
wife
pointing
across
the
river
in
the
hands
of
the
who
are
taking
him
away
again
the
indians
ran
to
the
river
seized
some
canoes
that
they
found
there
and
crossing
over
to
sandwich
compelled
general
proctor
a
second
time
to
forego
his
intentions
a
third
time
this
officer
made
the
attempt
and
succeeded
in
arresting
kinzie
and
conveying
him
heavily
ironed
to
fort
malden
in
canada
at
the
mouth
of
the
detroit
river
here
he
was
at
first
treated
with
great
severity
but
after
a
time
the
rigor
of
his
confinement
was
somewhat
relaxed
and
he
was
permitted
to
walk
on
the
bank
of
the
river
for
air
and
exercise
on
the
of
september
as
he
was
taking
his
promenade
under
the
close
supervision
of
a
guard
of
soldiers
the
whole
party
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
guns
upon
lake
erie
at
no
great
distance
below
what
could
it
mean
it
must
be
commodore
barclay
firing
into
some
of
the
yankees
the
firing
continued
the
time
allotted
the
prisoner
for
his
daily
walk
expired
but
neither
he
nor
his
guard
observed
the
lapse
of
time
so
anxiously
were
they
listening
to
what
they
now
felt
sure
was
an
engagement
between
ships
of
war
at
length
kinzie
was
reminded
that
the
hour
for
his
return
to
confinement
had
arrived
he
petitioned
for
another
let
me
stay
said
he
till
we
can
learn
how
the
battle
has
gone
very
soon
a
sloop
appeared
under
press
of
sail
rounding
the
point
and
presently
two
in
chase
of
her
she
is
running
she
bears
the
british
colors
cried
he
yes
yes
they
are
lowering
she
is
striking
her
flag
now
turning
to
the
soldiers
i
will
go
back
to
prison
contented
i
know
how
the
battle
has
gone
the
sloop
was
the
little
belt
the
last
of
the
squadron
captured
by
the
gallant
perry
on
that
memorable
occasion
which
he
announced
in
the
immortal
words
we
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
ours
matters
were
growing
critical
and
it
was
necessary
to
transfer
all
prisoners
to
a
place
of
greater
security
than
the
frontier
was
now
likely
to
be
it
was
resolved
therefore
to
send
kinzie
to
the
nothing
has
ever
appeared
which
would
explain
the
course
of
general
proctor
in
regard
to
this
gentleman
he
had
been
taken
from
the
bosom
of
his
family
where
he
was
living
quietly
under
the
parole
which
he
had
received
and
protected
by
the
stipulations
of
the
surrender
he
was
kept
for
months
in
confinement
now
he
was
placed
on
horseback
under
a
strong
guard
who
announced
that
they
had
orders
to
shoot
him
through
the
head
if
he
offered
to
speak
to
a
person
upon
the
road
he
was
tied
upon
the
saddle
to
prevent
his
escape
and
thus
they
set
out
for
quebec
a
little
incident
occurred
which
will
help
to
illustrate
the
course
invariably
pursued
towards
our
citizens
at
this
period
by
the
british
army
on
the
northwestern
frontier
the
saddle
on
which
kinzie
rode
had
not
been
properly
fastened
and
owing
to
the
rough
motion
of
the
animal
on
which
it
was
it
turned
so
as
to
bring
the
rider
into
a
most
awkward
and
painful
position
his
limbs
being
fastened
he
could
not
disengage
himself
and
in
this
manner
he
was
compelled
by
those
who
had
charge
of
him
to
ride
until
he
was
nearly
exhausted
before
they
had
the
humanity
to
release
him
arrived
at
quebec
he
was
put
on
board
a
small
vessel
to
be
sent
to
england
the
vessel
when
a
few
days
out
at
sea
was
chased
by
an
american
frigate
and
driven
into
halifax
a
second
time
she
set
sail
when
she
sprung
a
leak
and
was
compelled
to
put
back
the
attempt
to
send
him
across
the
ocean
was
now
abandoned
and
he
was
returned
to
quebec
another
step
equally
inexplicable
with
his
arrest
was
soon
after
taken
this
was
his
release
and
that
of
macomb
of
detroit
who
was
also
in
confinement
in
quebec
and
the
permission
given
them
to
return
to
their
friends
and
families
although
the
war
was
not
yet
ended
it
may
possibly
be
imagined
that
in
the
treatment
these
gentlemen
received
the
british
sheltered
himself
under
the
plea
of
their
being
british
subjects
and
perhaps
when
it
was
ascertained
that
kinzie
was
indeed
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
it
was
thought
safest
to
release
him
in
the
mean
time
general
harrison
at
the
head
of
his
troops
had
reached
detroit
he
landed
on
the
of
september
all
the
citizens
went
forth
to
meet
him
kinzie
leading
her
children
by
the
hand
was
of
the
number
the
general
accompanied
her
to
her
home
and
took
up
his
abode
there
on
his
arrival
he
was
introduced
to
who
happened
to
be
on
a
visit
to
the
family
at
that
time
the
general
had
seen
the
chief
the
preceding
year
at
the
council
at
vincennes
and
the
meeting
was
one
of
great
cordiality
and
interest
in
kinzie
and
his
family
again
returned
to
chicago
the
fort
was
rebuilt
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
than
the
former
one
it
was
not
until
the
return
of
the
troops
that
the
bones
of
the
unfortunate
americans
who
had
been
massacred
four
years
before
were
collected
and
buried
an
indian
agency
under
the
charge
of
charles
jewett
of
kentucky
was
established
he
was
succeeded
in
by
alexander
wolcott
of
connecticut
who
occupied
that
position
until
his
death
in
the
troops
were
removed
from
the
garrison
in
but
restored
in
after
the
winnebago
war
this
was
a
disturbance
between
the
winnebagoes
and
white
settlers
on
and
near
the
mississippi
after
some
murders
had
been
committed
the
young
chief
red
bird
was
taken
and
imprisoned
at
prairie
du
chien
to
await
his
trial
where
he
committed
suicide
in
consequence
of
chagrin
and
the
irksomeness
of
confinement
it
was
feared
that
the
pottowattamies
would
make
common
cause
with
the
winnebagoes
and
commence
a
general
system
of
havoc
and
bloodshed
on
the
frontier
they
were
deterred
from
such
a
step
probably
by
the
exertions
of
billy
caldwell
robinson
and
who
made
an
expedition
among
the
rock
river
bands
to
argue
and
persuade
them
into
remaining
tranquil
the
few
citizens
of
chicago
in
those
days
lived
for
the
most
part
a
very
quiet
unvaried
life
the
great
abundance
of
game
and
the
immense
fertility
of
the
lands
they
cultivated
furnished
them
with
a
superabundance
of
all
the
luxuries
of
garden
and
dairy
the
question
was
once
asked
by
a
friend
in
the
east
countrie
how
do
you
dispose
of
all
the
good
things
you
raise
you
have
no
market
no
and
you
can
not
consume
them
all
yourselves
no
what
then
do
you
do
with
them
why
we
manage
when
a
vessel
arrives
to
persuade
the
captain
to
accept
a
few
kegs
of
butter
and
stores
of
corn
and
vegetables
as
a
present
and
that
helps
us
to
get
rid
of
some
of
our
overplus
the
mails
arrived
as
may
be
supposed
at
very
rare
intervals
they
were
brought
occasionally
from
fort
clark
peoria
but
more
frequently
from
fort
wayne
or
across
the
peninsula
of
michigan
which
was
still
a
wilderness
peopled
with
savages
the
hardy
adventurer
who
acted
as
express
was
not
unfrequently
obliged
to
imitate
the
birds
of
heaven
and
lodge
among
the
branches
in
order
to
insure
the
safety
of
himself
and
his
charge
visitors
were
very
rare
unless
it
was
a
friend
who
came
to
sojourn
for
several
months
and
share
a
life
in
the
wilderness
a
traveller
however
occasionally
found
his
way
to
the
spot
in
passing
to
or
from
parts
unknown
and
such
a
one
was
sure
of
a
hospitable
and
hearty
welcome
a
gentleman
journeying
from
the
southern
settlements
once
arrived
late
in
the
evening
at
wolf
point
where
was
then
the
small
of
george
hunt
and
a
wallace
he
stopped
and
inquired
if
he
could
have
accommodation
for
the
night
for
himself
and
his
horse
the
answer
was
that
they
were
ill
provided
to
entertain
a
stranger
the
house
was
small
and
they
were
keeping
bachelor
hall
is
there
no
place
inquired
the
traveller
where
i
can
obtain
a
lodging
oh
yes
you
will
find
a
very
comfortable
house
kinzie
about
half
a
mile
below
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
stranger
turned
his
horse
head
and
took
the
road
indicated
arrived
at
the
spot
his
first
inquiry
was
is
this
the
residence
of
mr
kinzie
yes
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
get
accommodation
for
myself
and
horse
certainly
sir
walk
in
the
horse
was
taken
to
the
stable
while
the
gentleman
was
ushered
into
a
parlor
where
were
two
ladies
the
usual
preliminary
questions
and
answers
were
gone
through
for
in
a
new
country
people
soon
become
acquainted
and
the
gentleman
ere
long
found
himself
seated
at
a
comfortable
hot
supper
we
will
venture
to
say
a
fine
supper
since
the
table
in
this
domestic
establishment
has
always
been
somewhat
famous
apparently
the
gentleman
enjoyed
it
for
he
made
himself
quite
at
home
he
even
called
for
a
after
tea
and
drew
off
his
boots
the
ladies
were
a
little
surprised
but
they
had
lived
a
good
while
out
of
the
world
and
they
did
not
know
what
changes
in
etiquette
might
have
taken
place
during
their
retirement
before
taking
his
leave
for
the
night
the
traveller
signified
what
it
would
please
him
to
have
for
breakfast
which
was
duly
prepared
the
next
day
proved
stormy
the
gentleman
was
satisfied
with
his
quarters
and
having
taken
care
to
ascertain
that
there
was
no
neglect
or
deficiency
of
accommodation
so
far
as
his
horse
was
concerned
he
got
through
the
day
very
comfortably
now
and
then
when
he
was
tired
of
reading
he
would
converse
with
the
family
and
seemed
upon
the
whole
by
no
means
disposed
to
hold
himself
aloof
but
to
indulge
in
a
little
becoming
sociability
seeing
they
were
all
there
away
in
the
woods
the
second
day
the
weather
brightened
the
traveller
signified
his
intention
to
depart
he
ordered
his
horse
to
the
door
then
he
called
for
his
bill
my
house
is
not
a
tavern
sir
was
the
astounding
reply
not
a
tavern
good
heavens
have
i
been
making
myself
at
home
in
this
manner
in
a
private
family
he
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
which
however
were
quite
unnecessary
for
the
family
had
perceived
from
the
first
the
mistake
he
had
fallen
into
and
they
had
amused
themselves
during
his
whole
visit
in
anticipating
the
consternation
of
their
guest
when
he
should
be
undeceived
it
was
in
the
year
the
year
of
the
rebuilding
of
the
fort
after
its
destruction
by
the
indians
that
the
tract
of
land
on
which
chicago
stands
together
with
the
surrounding
country
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
the
pottowattamies
they
remained
the
peaceful
occupants
of
it
however
for
twenty
years
longer
it
was
not
until
that
they
were
removed
by
government
to
lands
appropriated
for
their
use
on
the
upper
missouri
in
the
year
the
town
of
chicago
was
laid
out
into
lots
by
commissioners
appointed
by
the
state
at
this
time
the
prices
of
these
lots
ranged
from
ten
to
sixty
dollars
kinzie
who
from
the
geographical
position
of
this
place
and
the
vast
fertility
of
the
surrounding
country
had
always
foretold
its
eventual
prosperity
and
importance
was
not
permitted
to
witness
the
realization
of
his
predictions
he
closed
his
useful
and
energetic
life
on
the
of
january
having
just
completed
his
year
chapter
xxi
a
sermon
chicago
was
not
at
the
period
of
my
first
visit
the
cheerful
happy
place
it
had
once
been
the
death
of
wolcott
of
lieutenant
furman
and
of
a
promising
young
son
of
beaubien
all
within
a
few
weeks
of
each
other
had
thrown
a
gloom
over
the
different
branches
of
the
social
circle
the
weather
too
was
inclement
and
stormy
beyond
anything
that
had
been
known
before
only
twice
during
a
period
of
two
months
did
the
sun
shine
out
through
the
entire
day
so
late
as
the
second
week
in
april
when
my
husband
had
left
to
return
to
fort
winnebago
the
storms
were
so
severe
that
he
and
his
men
were
obliged
to
lie
by
two
or
three
days
in
an
indian
lodge
robert
kinzie
medard
beaubien
and
billy
caldwell
had
gone
at
the
same
time
to
the
calumet
to
hunt
and
as
they
did
not
make
their
appearance
for
many
days
we
were
persuaded
they
had
perished
with
cold
they
returned
at
length
however
to
our
infinite
joy
having
only
escaped
freezing
by
the
forethought
of
robert
and
caldwell
in
carrying
each
two
blankets
instead
of
one
our
only
recreation
was
an
occasional
ride
on
horseback
when
the
weather
would
permit
through
the
woods
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
or
across
the
prairie
along
the
lake
shore
on
the
south
when
we
went
in
the
former
direction
a
little
took
us
along
what
is
now
rush
street
the
thick
boughs
of
the
trees
arched
over
our
heads
and
we
were
often
compelled
as
we
rode
to
break
away
the
projecting
branches
of
the
shrubs
which
impeded
our
path
the
little
prairie
west
of
wright
woods
was
the
usual
termination
of
our
ride
in
this
direction
when
we
chose
the
path
across
the
prairie
towards
the
south
we
generally
passed
a
harmon
superintending
the
construction
of
a
at
a
spot
he
had
chosen
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
this
inclosure
he
occupied
himself
as
the
season
advanced
in
planting
of
all
descriptions
to
make
ready
a
garden
and
orchard
for
future
enjoyment
we
usually
stopped
to
have
a
little
chat
the
two
favorite
themes
of
the
doctor
were
horticulture
and
the
certain
future
importance
of
chicago
that
it
was
destined
to
be
a
great
city
was
his
unalterable
conviction
and
in
deed
by
this
time
all
forest
and
prairie
as
it
was
we
half
began
to
believe
it
ourselves
on
the
pleasant
afternoons
which
we
occasionally
enjoyed
as
the
season
advanced
we
found
no
small
amusement
in
practising
the
place
appropriated
to
this
sport
was
outside
the
pickets
the
mark
being
placed
on
a
panel
in
one
of
the
bastions
the
gentlemen
must
not
be
offended
if
i
record
that
in
process
of
time
the
ladies
acquired
a
degree
of
skill
that
enabled
them
as
a
general
thing
to
come
off
triumphant
one
of
the
ladies
hunter
was
a
great
shot
having
brought
down
her
grouse
on
the
wing
to
the
no
small
delight
of
one
of
the
officers
captain
martin
scott
of
raccoon
celebrity
now
and
then
there
was
a
little
excitement
within
the
fort
aroused
by
the
discovery
that
had
been
engaged
in
selling
instead
of
milk
to
the
soldiers
thereby
interfering
in
no
small
degree
with
the
regularity
and
perfect
discipline
of
the
service
the
first
step
was
to
drum
out
the
offender
with
all
the
honors
of
war
that
is
with
a
dress
and
the
rogue
march
played
behind
him
the
next
to
place
all
the
victims
of
this
piece
of
deception
in
the
where
the
commanding
officer
lady
supplied
them
bountifully
with
coffee
and
hot
cakes
by
way
of
opening
their
eyes
to
the
enormity
of
their
offence
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
officers
sometimes
complained
of
its
being
more
of
a
strife
with
the
soldiers
who
should
get
into
the
than
who
should
keep
out
of
it
the
poor
fellows
knew
when
they
were
well
off
once
upon
a
sunday
we
were
rowed
up
to
wolf
point
to
attend
a
religious
service
conducted
by
father
see
as
he
was
called
we
saw
a
tall
slender
man
dressed
in
a
green
from
the
sleeves
of
which
dangled
a
pair
of
hands
giving
abundant
evidence
together
with
the
rest
of
his
dress
that
he
placed
small
faith
in
the
axiom
cleanliness
is
a
part
of
holiness
he
stepped
briskly
upon
a
little
platform
behind
a
table
and
commenced
his
discourse
his
subject
was
the
fear
of
god
there
was
a
kind
of
fear
he
told
us
that
was
very
nearly
to
love
so
nearly
that
it
was
not
worth
while
splitting
hairs
for
the
difference
he
then
went
on
to
describe
this
kind
of
fear
he
grew
more
and
more
involved
as
he
proceeded
with
his
description
until
at
length
quite
bewildered
he
paused
and
exclaimed
come
let
stop
a
little
while
and
clear
away
the
brush
he
unravelled
as
well
as
he
was
able
the
tangled
thread
of
his
ideas
and
went
on
with
his
subject
but
soon
again
losing
his
way
he
came
to
a
second
halt
now
said
he
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
many
degrees
from
clean
now
suppose
we
drive
back
a
little
piece
thus
he
recapitulated
what
he
wished
to
impress
upon
us
of
the
necessity
of
cherishing
a
fear
that
maketh
wise
unto
salvation
which
fear
said
he
may
we
all
enjoy
that
together
we
may
soar
away
on
the
rolling
clouds
of
aether
to
a
boundless
and
happy
eternity
which
is
the
wish
of
your
humble
servant
and
flourishing
abroad
his
hands
with
the
best
of
bows
he
took
his
seat
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
we
felt
our
own
religious
exercises
at
home
to
be
more
edifying
than
such
as
this
and
that
we
confined
ourselves
to
them
for
the
future
the
return
of
our
brother
robert
kinzie
from
palestine
not
the
holy
land
but
the
seat
of
the
land
office
with
the
certificate
of
the
title
of
the
family
to
that
portion
of
chicago
since
known
as
addition
was
looked
upon
as
establishing
a
home
for
us
at
some
future
day
if
the
glorious
dreams
of
good
harmon
and
a
few
others
should
come
to
be
realized
one
little
incident
will
show
how
moderate
were
the
anticipations
of
most
persons
at
that
period
the
certificate
which
was
issued
in
robert
name
he
representing
the
family
in
making
the
application
described
only
a
fractional
of
one
hundred
and
two
acres
instead
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
the
river
and
lake
michigan
cutting
off
acres
on
the
southern
and
eastern
lines
of
the
quarter
the
applicants
had
liberty
to
select
their
complement
of
acres
out
of
any
unappropriated
land
that
suited
them
now
my
son
said
his
mother
to
robert
lay
your
claim
on
the
at
wolf
point
it
is
fine
land
and
will
always
be
valuable
for
cultivation
besides
as
it
faces
down
the
main
river
the
situation
will
always
be
a
convenient
one
the
answer
was
a
hearty
laugh
hear
mother
said
robert
we
have
just
got
a
hundred
and
two
acres
more
than
we
shall
ever
want
or
know
what
to
do
with
and
now
she
would
have
me
go
and
claim
acres
more
take
my
advice
my
boy
repeated
his
mother
or
you
may
live
one
day
to
regret
it
well
i
can
not
see
how
i
can
ever
regret
not
getting
more
than
we
can
possibly
make
use
of
and
so
the
matter
ended
the
acres
were
never
claimed
and
there
was
i
think
a
very
general
impression
that
asking
for
our
just
rights
in
the
case
would
have
a
very
grasping
covetous
look
how
much
wiser
years
have
made
us
during
my
sojourn
of
two
months
at
chicago
our
mother
often
entertained
me
with
stories
of
her
early
life
and
adventures
the
following
is
her
history
of
her
captivity
among
the
senecas
which
i
have
put
in
the
form
of
a
tale
although
without
the
slightest
variation
from
the
facts
as
i
received
them
from
her
lips
and
those
of
her
sister
william
forsyth
of
sandwich
the
little
maggie
of
the
story
chapter
xxii
the
captives
it
is
well
known
that
previous
to
the
war
of
the
revolution
the
whole
of
the
western
portion
of
pennsylvania
was
inhabited
by
different
indian
tribes
of
these
the
delawares
were
the
friends
of
the
whites
and
after
the
commencement
of
the
great
struggle
took
part
with
the
united
states
the
iroquois
on
the
contrary
were
the
friends
and
allies
of
the
very
few
white
settlers
had
ventured
beyond
the
susquehanna
the
numerous
roving
bands
of
shawanoes
nanticokes
although
at
times
professing
friendship
with
the
americans
and
acting
in
concert
with
the
delawares
or
lenape
as
allies
at
others
suffered
themselves
to
be
seduced
by
their
neighbors
the
iroquois
to
show
a
most
sanguinary
spirit
of
hostility
for
this
reason
the
life
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
frontier
was
one
of
constant
peril
and
alarm
many
a
scene
of
dismal
barbarity
was
enacted
as
the
history
of
the
times
testifies
and
even
those
who
felt
themselves
in
some
measure
protected
by
their
immediate
neighbors
the
delawares
never
lost
sight
of
the
caution
required
by
their
exposed
situation
the
vicinity
of
the
military
garrison
at
pittsburg
or
fort
pitt
as
it
was
then
called
gave
additional
security
to
those
who
had
pushed
farther
west
among
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
alleghany
and
monongahela
among
these
were
the
family
of
lytle
who
some
years
previous
to
the
opening
of
our
story
had
removed
from
baltimore
to
path
valley
near
carlisle
and
subsequently
settled
himself
on
the
banks
of
plum
river
a
tributary
of
the
alleghany
here
with
his
wife
and
five
children
he
had
continued
to
live
in
comfort
and
security
undisturbed
by
any
hostile
visit
and
only
annoyed
by
occasional
false
alarms
from
his
more
timorous
neighbors
who
having
had
more
experience
in
frontier
life
were
prone
to
anticipate
evil
as
well
as
to
magnify
every
appearance
of
danger
on
a
bright
afternoon
in
the
autumn
of
two
children
of
lytle
a
girl
of
nine
and
her
brother
two
years
younger
were
playing
in
a
little
dingle
or
hollow
in
the
rear
of
their
father
house
some
large
trees
which
had
been
recently
felled
were
lying
here
and
there
still
untrimmed
of
their
branches
and
many
logs
prepared
for
fuel
were
scattered
around
upon
one
of
these
the
children
wearied
with
their
sports
seated
themselves
and
to
beguile
the
time
they
fell
into
conversation
upon
a
subject
that
greatly
perplexed
them
while
playing
in
the
same
place
a
few
hours
previous
they
had
imagined
they
saw
an
indian
lurking
behind
one
of
the
fallen
trees
the
indians
of
the
neighborhood
were
in
the
habit
of
making
occasional
visits
to
the
family
and
they
had
become
familiar
and
even
affectionate
with
many
of
them
but
this
seemed
a
stranger
and
after
the
first
hasty
glance
they
fled
in
alarm
to
the
house
their
mother
chid
them
for
the
report
they
brought
which
she
endeavored
to
convince
them
was
without
foundation
you
know
said
she
you
are
always
alarming
us
unnecessarily
the
neighbors
children
have
frightened
you
to
death
go
back
to
your
play
and
learn
to
be
more
courageous
so
the
children
returned
to
their
sports
hardly
persuaded
by
their
mother
arguments
while
they
were
thus
seated
upon
the
trunk
of
the
tree
their
discourse
was
interrupted
by
the
note
apparently
of
a
quail
not
far
off
listen
said
the
boy
as
a
second
note
answered
the
first
do
you
hear
that
yes
was
the
reply
and
after
a
few
moments
silence
do
you
not
hear
a
rustling
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
yonder
perhaps
it
is
a
squirrel
but
look
what
is
that
surely
i
saw
something
red
among
the
branches
it
looked
like
a
fawn
popping
up
its
head
at
this
moment
the
children
who
had
been
gazing
so
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
fallen
tree
that
all
other
objects
were
forgotten
felt
themselves
seized
from
behind
and
pinioned
in
an
iron
grasp
what
were
their
horror
and
dismay
to
find
themselves
in
the
arms
of
savages
whose
terrific
countenances
and
gestures
plainly
showed
them
to
be
enemies
they
made
signs
to
the
children
to
be
silent
on
pain
of
death
and
hurried
them
off
half
dead
with
terror
in
a
direction
leading
from
their
father
habitation
after
travelling
some
distance
in
profound
silence
the
severity
of
their
captors
somewhat
relaxed
and
as
night
approached
the
party
halted
after
adopting
the
usual
precautions
to
secure
themselves
against
a
surprise
in
an
agony
of
uncertainty
and
terror
torn
from
their
beloved
home
and
parents
and
anticipating
all
the
horrors
with
which
the
rumors
of
the
times
had
invested
a
captivity
among
the
indians
perhaps
even
a
torturing
death
the
poor
children
could
no
longer
restrain
their
grief
but
gave
vent
to
sobs
and
lamentations
their
distress
appeared
to
excite
the
compassion
of
one
of
the
party
a
man
of
mild
aspect
who
approached
and
endeavored
to
soothe
them
he
spread
them
a
couch
of
the
long
grass
which
grew
near
the
offered
them
a
portion
of
his
own
stock
of
dried
meat
and
parched
corn
and
gave
them
to
understand
by
signs
that
no
farther
evil
was
intended
them
these
kindly
demonstrations
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
another
party
of
the
enemy
bringing
with
them
the
mother
of
the
little
prisoners
with
her
youngest
child
an
infant
of
three
months
old
it
had
so
happened
that
the
father
of
the
family
with
his
had
gone
early
in
the
day
to
a
at
a
few
miles
distance
and
the
house
had
thus
been
left
without
a
defender
the
long
period
of
tranquillity
which
they
had
enjoyed
free
from
all
molestation
or
alarm
from
the
savages
had
thrown
the
settlers
quite
off
their
guard
and
they
had
recently
laid
aside
some
of
the
caution
they
had
formerly
deemed
necessary
these
indians
by
lying
in
wait
had
found
the
favorable
moment
for
seizing
the
defenceless
family
and
making
them
prisoners
judging
from
their
paint
and
other
marks
by
which
the
early
settlers
learned
to
distinguish
the
various
tribes
lytle
conjectured
that
those
into
whose
hands
she
and
her
children
had
fallen
were
senecas
nor
was
she
mistaken
it
was
a
party
of
that
tribe
who
had
descended
from
their
village
with
the
intention
of
falling
upon
some
isolated
band
of
their
enemies
the
delawares
but
failing
in
this
had
made
themselves
amends
by
capturing
a
few
white
settlers
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
generally
mild
disposition
of
this
tribe
together
with
the
magnanimous
character
of
the
chief
who
accompanied
the
party
that
their
prisoners
in
the
present
instance
escaped
the
fate
of
most
of
the
americans
who
were
so
unhappy
as
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
iroquois
the
children
learned
from
their
mother
that
she
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
fate
of
their
remaining
brother
and
sister
a
boy
of
six
and
a
little
girl
of
four
years
of
age
but
she
was
in
hopes
they
had
made
good
their
escape
with
the
who
had
likewise
disappeared
from
the
commencement
after
remaining
a
few
hours
to
recruit
the
exhausted
frames
of
the
prisoners
the
savages
again
started
on
their
march
one
of
the
older
indians
offering
to
relieve
the
mother
from
the
burden
of
her
infant
which
she
had
hitherto
carried
in
her
arms
pleased
with
the
unexpected
kindness
she
resigned
to
him
her
tender
charge
thus
they
pursued
their
way
the
savage
who
carried
the
infant
lingering
somewhat
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
until
finding
a
spot
convenient
for
his
purpose
he
grasped
his
innocent
victim
by
the
feet
and
with
one
whirl
to
add
strength
to
the
blow
dashed
out
its
brains
against
a
tree
leaving
the
body
upon
the
spot
he
rejoined
the
party
the
mother
unsuspicious
of
what
had
passed
regarded
him
earnestly
as
he
reappeared
without
the
child
then
gazed
wildly
around
on
the
rest
of
the
group
her
beloved
little
one
was
not
there
its
absence
spoke
its
fate
but
suppressing
the
shriek
of
agony
for
she
knew
that
the
lives
of
the
remaining
ones
depended
upon
her
firmness
in
that
trying
hour
she
drew
them
yet
closer
to
her
and
pursued
her
melancholy
way
without
a
word
spoken
or
a
question
asked
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
cried
unto
him
who
is
able
to
save
and
he
comforted
her
with
hopes
of
deliverance
for
the
surviving
ones
for
she
saw
that
if
blood
had
been
their
sole
object
the
scalps
of
herself
and
her
children
would
have
been
taken
upon
the
spot
where
they
were
made
prisoners
she
read
too
in
the
eyes
of
one
who
was
evidently
the
commander
of
the
party
an
expression
more
merciful
than
she
had
even
dared
to
hope
particularly
had
she
observed
his
soothing
manner
and
manifest
partiality
towards
her
eldest
child
the
little
girl
of
whom
we
have
spoken
and
she
built
many
a
bright
hope
of
escape
or
ransom
upon
these
slender
foundations
after
a
toilsome
and
painful
march
of
many
days
the
party
reached
the
seneca
village
upon
the
of
the
alleghany
near
what
is
now
called
olean
point
on
their
arrival
the
chief
their
conductor
who
was
distinguished
by
the
name
of
the
white
led
his
prisoners
to
the
principal
lodge
this
was
occupied
by
his
mother
the
widow
of
the
of
that
band
and
who
was
called
by
them
the
on
entering
her
presence
her
son
presented
her
the
little
girl
saying
my
mother
i
bring
you
a
child
to
supply
the
place
of
my
brother
who
was
killed
by
the
lenape
six
moons
ago
she
shall
dwell
in
my
lodge
and
be
to
me
a
sister
take
the
white
woman
and
her
children
and
treat
them
kindly
our
father
will
give
us
many
horses
and
guns
to
buy
them
back
again
he
referred
to
the
british
indian
agent
of
his
tribe
colonel
johnson
an
excellent
and
benevolent
gentleman
who
resided
at
port
niagara
on
the
british
side
of
the
river
of
that
name
the
old
queen
fulfilled
the
injunctions
of
her
son
she
received
the
prisoners
and
every
comfort
was
provided
them
that
her
simple
and
primitive
mode
of
life
rendered
possible
we
must
now
return
to
the
place
and
period
at
which
our
story
commences
late
in
the
evening
of
that
day
the
father
returned
to
his
dwelling
all
within
and
around
was
silent
and
desolate
no
trace
of
a
living
creature
was
to
be
found
throughout
the
house
or
grounds
his
nearest
neighbors
lived
at
a
considerable
distance
but
to
them
he
hastened
frantically
demanding
tidings
of
his
family
as
he
aroused
them
from
their
slumbers
one
and
another
joined
him
in
the
search
and
at
length
at
the
house
of
one
of
them
was
found
the
who
had
effected
her
escape
her
first
place
of
refuge
she
said
had
been
a
large
in
an
outer
kitchen
under
which
she
had
at
the
first
alarm
secreted
herself
until
the
departure
of
the
indians
who
were
evidently
in
haste
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
fleeing
to
a
place
of
safety
she
could
give
no
tidings
of
her
mistress
and
the
children
except
that
they
had
not
been
murdered
in
her
sight
or
hearing
at
length
having
scoured
the
neighborhood
without
success
lytle
remembered
an
old
settler
who
lived
alone
far
up
the
valley
thither
he
and
his
friends
immediately
repaired
and
from
him
they
learned
that
being
at
work
in
his
field
just
before
sunset
he
had
seen
a
party
of
strange
indians
passing
at
a
short
distance
from
his
cabin
as
they
wound
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
he
could
perceive
that
they
had
prisoners
with
them
a
woman
and
a
child
the
woman
he
knew
to
be
a
white
as
she
carried
her
infant
in
her
arms
instead
of
upon
her
back
after
the
manner
of
the
savages
day
had
now
begun
to
break
for
the
night
had
been
passed
in
fruitless
searches
and
the
agonized
father
after
a
consultation
with
his
kind
friends
and
neighbors
accepted
their
offer
to
accompany
him
to
fort
pitt
to
ask
advice
and
assistance
of
the
commandant
and
indian
agent
at
that
place
proceeding
down
the
valley
as
they
approached
a
hut
which
the
night
before
they
had
found
apparently
deserted
they
were
startled
by
observing
two
children
standing
upon
the
high
bank
in
front
of
it
the
delighted
father
recognized
two
of
his
missing
flock
but
no
tidings
could
they
give
him
of
their
mother
and
the
other
lost
ones
their
story
was
simple
and
touching
they
were
playing
in
the
garden
when
they
were
alarmed
by
seeing
the
indians
enter
the
yard
near
the
house
unperceived
by
them
the
brother
who
was
but
six
years
of
age
helped
his
little
sister
over
the
fence
into
a
field
overrun
with
bushes
of
the
blackberry
and
wild
raspberry
they
concealed
themselves
among
these
for
awhile
and
then
finding
all
quiet
they
attempted
to
force
their
way
to
the
side
of
the
field
farthest
from
the
house
unfortunately
the
little
girl
in
her
play
in
the
garden
had
pulled
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
the
briers
tearing
and
wounding
her
tender
feet
she
with
difficulty
could
refrain
from
crying
out
her
brother
took
off
his
stockings
and
put
them
on
her
feet
he
attempted
too
to
protect
them
with
his
shoes
but
they
were
too
large
and
kept
slipping
off
so
that
she
could
not
wear
them
for
a
time
they
persevered
in
making
what
they
considered
their
escape
from
certain
death
for
as
i
have
said
the
children
had
been
taught
by
the
tales
they
had
heard
to
regard
all
strange
indians
as
ministers
of
torture
and
of
horrors
worse
than
death
exhausted
with
pain
and
fatigue
the
poor
little
girl
at
length
declared
she
could
go
no
farther
then
maggie
said
her
brother
i
must
kill
you
for
i
can
not
let
you
be
killed
by
the
indians
oh
no
thomas
pleaded
she
do
not
pray
do
not
kill
me
i
do
not
think
the
indians
will
find
us
oh
yes
they
will
maggie
and
i
could
kill
you
so
much
easier
than
they
would
for
a
long
time
he
endeavored
to
persuade
her
and
even
looked
about
for
a
stick
sufficiently
large
for
his
purpose
but
despair
gave
the
little
creature
strength
and
she
promised
her
brother
that
she
would
neither
complain
nor
falter
if
he
would
assist
her
in
making
her
way
out
of
the
field
the
idea
of
the
little
boy
that
he
could
save
his
sister
from
savage
barbarity
by
taking
her
life
himself
shows
what
tales
of
horror
the
children
of
the
early
settlers
were
familiar
with
after
a
few
more
efforts
they
made
their
way
out
of
the
field
into
an
uninclosed
where
to
their
great
delight
they
saw
some
cows
feeding
they
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
granny
myers
an
old
woman
who
lived
at
some
little
distance
but
in
what
direction
from
the
place
they
then
were
they
were
utterly
ignorant
with
a
sagacity
beyond
his
years
the
boy
said
let
us
hide
ourselves
till
sunset
when
the
cows
will
go
home
and
we
will
follow
them
they
did
so
but
to
their
dismay
when
they
reached
granny
myers
they
found
the
house
deserted
the
old
woman
had
been
called
by
some
business
down
the
valley
and
did
not
return
that
night
tired
and
hungry
they
could
go
no
farther
but
after
an
almost
fruitless
endeavor
to
get
some
milk
from
the
cows
they
laid
themselves
down
to
sleep
under
an
old
bedstead
that
stood
behind
the
house
their
father
and
his
party
had
caused
them
additional
terror
in
the
night
the
shouts
and
calls
which
had
been
designed
to
arouse
the
inmates
of
the
house
they
had
mistaken
for
the
whoop
of
the
indians
and
not
being
able
to
distinguish
friends
from
foes
they
had
crept
close
to
one
another
as
far
out
of
sight
as
possible
when
found
the
following
morning
they
were
debating
what
course
to
take
next
for
safety
the
commandant
at
fort
pitt
entered
warmly
into
the
affairs
of
lytle
and
readily
furnished
him
with
a
detachment
of
soldiers
to
aid
him
and
his
friends
in
the
pursuit
of
the
marauders
some
circumstances
having
occurred
to
throw
suspicion
upon
the
senecas
the
party
soon
directed
their
search
among
the
villages
of
that
tribe
their
inquiries
were
prosecuted
in
various
directions
and
always
with
great
caution
for
all
the
tribes
of
the
iroquois
or
as
they
pompously
called
themselves
the
five
nations
being
allies
of
great
britain
were
inveterate
in
their
hostility
to
the
americans
thus
some
time
elapsed
before
the
father
with
his
attendants
reached
the
village
of
the
white
a
treaty
was
immediately
entered
into
for
the
ransom
of
the
captives
which
was
easily
accomplished
in
regard
to
lytle
and
the
younger
child
but
no
offers
no
entreaties
no
promises
could
procure
the
release
of
the
little
eleanor
the
adopted
child
of
the
tribe
no
the
chief
said
she
was
his
sister
he
had
taken
her
to
supply
the
place
of
his
brother
who
was
killed
by
the
enemy
she
was
dear
to
him
and
he
would
not
part
with
her
finding
every
effort
unavailing
to
shake
this
resolution
the
father
was
compelled
to
take
his
sorrowful
departure
with
such
of
his
beloved
ones
as
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
recover
we
will
not
attempt
to
depict
the
grief
of
parents
compelled
thus
to
give
up
a
darling
child
and
to
leave
her
in
the
hands
of
savages
whom
until
now
they
had
too
much
reason
to
regard
as
merciless
but
there
was
no
alternative
commending
her
to
the
care
of
their
heavenly
father
and
cheered
by
the
manifest
tenderness
with
which
she
had
thus
far
been
treated
they
set
out
on
their
melancholy
journey
homeward
trusting
that
some
future
effort
would
be
more
effectual
for
the
recovery
of
their
little
girl
having
placed
his
family
in
safety
at
pittsburg
lytle
still
assisted
by
the
commandant
and
the
indian
agent
undertook
an
expedition
to
the
frontier
to
the
residence
of
the
british
agent
colonel
johnson
his
representation
of
the
case
warmly
interested
the
feelings
of
that
benevolent
officer
who
promised
him
to
spare
no
exertions
in
his
behalf
this
promise
he
religiously
performed
he
went
in
person
to
the
village
of
the
big
white
man
as
soon
as
the
opening
of
the
spring
permitted
and
offered
him
many
splendid
presents
of
guns
and
horses
but
the
chief
was
inexorable
time
rolled
on
and
every
year
the
hope
of
recovering
the
little
captive
became
more
faint
she
in
the
mean
time
continued
to
wind
herself
more
and
more
closely
around
the
heart
of
her
indian
brother
nothing
could
exceed
the
consideration
and
affection
with
which
she
was
treated
not
only
by
himself
but
by
his
mother
the
all
their
stock
of
brooches
and
wampum
was
employed
in
the
decoration
of
her
person
the
principal
seat
and
the
most
delicate
viands
were
invariably
reserved
for
her
and
no
efforts
were
spared
to
promote
her
happiness
and
to
render
her
forgetful
of
her
former
home
and
kindred
thus
though
she
had
beheld
with
a
feeling
almost
amounting
to
despair
the
departure
of
her
parents
and
dear
little
brother
and
had
for
a
long
time
resisted
every
attempt
at
consolation
preferring
even
death
to
a
life
of
separation
from
all
she
loved
yet
time
as
it
ever
does
brought
its
soothing
balm
and
she
at
length
grew
contented
and
happy
from
her
activity
and
the
energy
of
her
character
qualities
for
which
she
was
remarkable
to
the
latest
period
of
her
life
the
name
was
given
her
of
ship
under
full
the
only
drawback
to
the
happiness
of
the
little
prisoner
aside
from
her
longings
after
her
own
dear
home
was
the
enmity
she
encountered
from
the
wife
of
the
big
white
man
this
woman
from
the
day
of
her
arrival
at
the
village
and
adoption
into
the
family
as
a
sister
had
conceived
for
her
the
greatest
animosity
which
at
first
she
had
the
prudence
to
conceal
from
the
observation
of
her
husband
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
a
wife
should
give
way
to
some
feelings
of
jealousy
at
seeing
her
own
place
in
the
heart
of
her
husband
usurped
by
the
child
of
their
enemy
the
american
but
these
feelings
were
aggravated
by
a
bad
and
vindictive
temper
and
by
the
indifference
with
which
her
husband
listened
to
her
complaints
and
murmurings
as
she
had
no
children
of
her
own
to
engage
her
attention
her
mind
was
the
more
engrossed
and
inflamed
with
her
fancied
wrongs
and
with
devising
means
for
their
redress
an
opportunity
of
attempting
the
latter
was
not
long
wanting
during
the
absence
of
the
big
white
man
upon
some
or
his
little
sister
was
taken
ill
with
fever
and
ague
she
was
nursed
with
the
utmost
tenderness
by
the
old
queen
and
the
wife
of
the
chief
to
lull
suspicion
and
thereby
accomplish
her
purpose
was
likewise
unwearied
in
her
assiduities
to
the
little
favorite
one
afternoon
during
the
temporary
absence
of
the
old
queen
her
entered
the
lodge
with
a
bowl
of
something
she
had
prepared
and
stooping
down
to
the
mat
on
which
the
child
lay
said
in
an
affectionate
accent
drink
my
sister
i
have
brought
you
that
which
will
drive
this
fever
far
from
you
on
raising
her
head
to
reply
the
little
girl
perceived
a
pair
of
eyes
peeping
through
a
crevice
in
the
lodge
and
fixed
upon
her
with
a
very
peculiar
and
significant
expression
with
the
quick
perception
acquired
partly
from
nature
and
partly
from
her
intercourse
with
this
people
she
replied
faintly
set
it
down
my
sister
when
this
fit
of
the
fever
has
passed
i
will
drink
your
medicine
the
squaw
too
cautious
to
use
importunity
busied
herself
about
in
the
lodge
for
a
short
time
then
withdrew
to
another
near
at
hand
meantime
the
bright
eyes
continued
peering
through
the
opening
until
they
had
watched
their
object
fairly
out
of
sight
then
a
low
voice
the
voice
of
a
young
friend
and
playfellow
spoke
do
not
drink
that
which
your
brother
wife
has
brought
you
she
hates
you
and
is
only
waiting
an
opportunity
to
rid
herself
of
you
i
have
watched
her
all
the
morning
and
have
seen
her
gathering
the
most
deadly
roots
and
herbs
i
knew
for
whom
they
were
intended
and
came
hither
to
warn
you
take
the
bowl
said
the
little
invalid
and
carry
it
to
my
lodge
this
was
accordingly
done
the
contents
of
the
bowl
were
found
to
consist
principally
of
a
decoction
of
the
root
of
the
the
most
deadly
poison
known
among
the
indians
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
language
to
describe
the
indignation
that
pervaded
the
little
community
when
this
discovery
was
made
known
the
squaws
ran
to
and
fro
as
is
their
custom
when
excited
each
vying
with
the
other
in
heaping
invectives
upon
the
culprit
no
further
punishment
was
however
for
the
present
inflicted
upon
her
but
the
first
burst
of
rage
over
she
was
treated
with
silent
abhorrence
the
little
patient
was
removed
to
the
lodge
of
the
old
queen
and
strictly
guarded
while
her
enemy
was
left
to
wander
in
silence
and
solitude
about
the
fields
and
woods
until
the
return
of
her
husband
should
determine
her
punishment
in
a
few
days
the
excursion
being
over
the
big
white
man
and
his
party
returned
to
the
village
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
of
savages
he
did
not
in
his
first
transport
at
learning
the
attempt
on
the
life
of
his
little
sister
take
summary
vengeance
on
the
offender
he
contented
himself
with
banishing
her
from
his
lodge
never
to
return
and
condemning
her
to
hoe
corn
in
a
distant
part
of
the
large
field
or
inclosure
which
served
the
whole
community
for
a
garden
although
she
would
still
show
her
vindictive
disposition
whenever
by
chance
the
little
girl
with
her
companions
wandered
into
that
vicinity
by
striking
at
her
with
her
hoe
or
by
some
other
spiteful
manifestation
yet
she
was
either
too
well
watched
or
stood
too
much
in
awe
of
her
former
husband
to
repeat
the
attempt
upon
his
sister
life
four
years
had
now
elapsed
since
the
capture
of
little
nelly
her
heart
was
by
nature
warm
and
affectionate
so
that
the
unbounded
tenderness
of
those
she
dwelt
among
had
called
forth
a
corresponding
feeling
in
her
heart
she
regarded
the
chief
and
his
mother
with
love
and
reverence
and
had
so
completely
learned
their
language
and
customs
as
almost
to
have
forgotten
her
own
so
identified
had
she
become
with
the
tribe
that
the
remembrance
of
her
home
and
family
had
nearly
faded
from
her
memory
all
but
her
mother
her
mother
whom
she
had
loved
with
a
strength
of
affection
natural
to
her
warm
and
ardent
character
and
to
whom
her
heart
still
clung
with
a
fondness
that
no
time
or
change
could
destroy
the
peace
of
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
now
took
place
a
general
pacification
of
the
indian
tribes
was
the
consequence
and
fresh
hopes
were
renewed
in
the
bosoms
of
and
lytle
they
removed
with
their
family
to
fort
niagara
near
which
on
the
american
side
was
the
great
of
the
senecas
colonel
johnson
readily
undertook
a
fresh
negotiation
with
the
chief
but
in
order
to
make
sure
every
chance
of
success
he
again
proceeded
in
person
to
the
village
of
the
big
white
man
his
visit
was
most
opportune
it
was
the
feast
of
the
green
corn
when
he
arrived
among
them
this
observance
which
corresponds
so
strikingly
with
the
jewish
feast
of
tabernacles
that
together
with
other
customs
it
has
led
many
to
believe
the
indian
nations
the
descendants
of
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
made
it
a
season
of
general
joy
and
festivity
all
other
occupations
were
suspended
to
give
place
to
social
enjoyment
in
the
open
air
or
in
arbors
formed
of
the
green
branches
of
the
trees
every
one
appeared
in
his
that
of
the
little
adopted
child
consisted
of
a
petticoat
of
blue
broadcloth
bordered
with
ribbons
a
sack
or
upper
garment
of
black
silk
ornamented
with
three
rows
of
silver
brooches
the
centre
ones
from
the
throat
to
the
hem
being
of
large
size
and
those
from
the
shoulders
down
being
no
larger
than
a
and
set
as
closely
as
possible
around
her
neck
were
innumerable
strings
of
white
and
purple
wampum
an
indian
ornament
manufactured
from
the
inner
surface
of
the
her
hair
was
clubbed
behind
and
loaded
with
beads
of
various
colors
leggings
of
scarlet
cloth
and
moccasins
of
embroidered
with
completed
her
costume
colonel
johnson
was
received
with
all
the
consideration
due
to
his
position
and
to
the
long
friendship
that
had
subsisted
between
him
and
the
tribe
observing
that
the
hilarity
of
the
festival
had
warmed
and
opened
all
hearts
he
took
occasion
in
an
interview
with
the
chief
to
expatiate
upon
the
parental
affection
which
had
led
the
father
and
mother
of
his
little
sister
to
give
up
their
friends
and
home
and
come
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
the
single
hope
of
sometimes
looking
upon
and
embracing
her
the
heart
of
the
chief
softened
as
he
listened
to
this
representation
and
he
was
induced
to
promise
that
at
the
grand
council
soon
to
be
held
at
fort
niagara
on
the
british
side
of
the
river
he
would
attend
bringing
his
little
sister
with
him
he
exacted
a
promise
however
from
colonel
johnson
that
not
only
no
effort
should
be
made
to
reclaim
the
child
but
that
even
no
proposition
to
part
with
her
should
be
offered
him
the
time
at
length
arrived
when
her
heart
bounding
with
joy
little
nelly
was
placed
on
horseback
to
accompany
her
indian
brother
to
the
great
council
of

senecas
she
had
promised
him
that
she
would
never
leave
him
without
his
permission
and
he
relied
confidently
on
her
word
thus
given
as
the
chiefs
and
warriors
arrived
in
successive
bands
to
meet
their
father
the
agent
at
the
how
did
the
anxious
hearts
of
the
parents
beat
with
alternate
hope
and
fear
the
officers
of
the
fort
had
kindly
given
them
quarters
for
the
time
being
and
the
ladies
whose
sympathies
were
strongly
excited
had
accompanied
the
mother
to
the
place
of
council
and
joined
in
her
longing
watch
for
the
first
appearance
of
the
band
from
the
alleghany
river
at
length
they
were
discerned
emerging
from
the
forest
on
the
opposite
or
american
side
boats
were
sent
across
by
the
commanding
officer
to
bring
the
chief
and
his
party
the
father
and
mother
attended
by
all
the
officers
and
ladies
stood
upon
the
grassy
bank
awaiting
their
approach
they
had
seen
at
a
glance
that
the
was
with
them
when
about
to
enter
the
boat
the
chief
said
to
some
of
his
young
men
stand
here
with
the
horses
and
wait
until
i
return
he
was
told
that
the
horses
should
be
ferried
across
and
taken
care
of
no
said
he
let
them
wait
he
held
his
darling
by
the
hand
until
the
river
was
passed
until
the
boat
touched
the
bank
until
the
child
sprang
forward
into
the
arms
of
the
mother
from
whom
she
had
been
so
long
separated
when
the
chief
witnessed
that
outburst
of
affection
he
could
withstand
no
longer
she
shall
go
said
he
the
mother
must
have
her
child
again
i
will
go
back
alone
with
one
silent
gesture
of
farewell
he
turned
and
stepped
on
board
the
boat
no
arguments
or
entreaties
could
induce
him
to
remain
at
the
council
but
having
gained
the
other
side
of
the
niagara
he
mounted
his
horse
and
with
his
young
men
was
soon
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
after
a
sojourn
of
a
few
weeks
at
niagara
lytle
dreading
lest
the
resolution
of
the
big
white
man
should
give
way
and
measures
be
taken
to
deprive
him
once
more
of
his
child
came
to
the
determination
of
again
changing
his
place
of
abode
he
therefore
took
the
first
opportunity
of
crossing
lake
erie
with
his
family
and
settled
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
detroit
where
he
continued
afterwards
to
reside
saw
her
friend
the
chief
no
more
but
she
never
forgot
him
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
remembered
with
tenderness
and
gratitude
her
brother
the
big
white
man
and
her
friends

playfellows

it
was
afterwards
called
at
the

rapids
in
a
detachment
of
british
troops
had
been
sent
down
from

to
take
possession
of
this
post
general

was
then
on
a
campaign
against
the
indians
and
the
british
government
thought
proper
to
make
a
few
demonstrations
in
behalf
of
their
allies
having
gone
out
with
a
party
to
reconnoitre
colonel
mckillip
was
returning
to
his
post
after
dark
when
he
was
fired
upon
and
killed
by
one
of
his
own
sentinels
mrs
helm
was
the
daughter
of
this
marriage
during
the
widowhood
of
mckillip
she
resided
with
her
parents
at
grosse
pointe
eight
miles
above
detroit
and
it
was
during
this
period
that
an
event
occurred
which
from
the
melancholy
and
mysterious
circumstances
attending
it
was
always
dwelt
upon
by
her
with
peculiar
interest
her
second
brother
thomas
lytle
was
from
his
amiable
and
affectionate
character
the
most
dearly
beloved
by
her
of
all
the
numerous
family
circle
he
was
paying
his
addresses
to
a
young
lady
who
resided
at
the
river
trench
as
it
was
then
called
now
the
river
thames
a
stream
emptying
into
lake
clair
about
twenty
miles
above
detroit
in
visiting
this
young
lady
it
was
his
custom
to
cross
the
detroit
river
by
the
ferry
with
his
horse
and
then
proceed
by
land
to
the
river
trench
which
was
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
a
fordable
stream
on
a
fine
forenoon
late
in
the
spring
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
mother
and
sister
for
one
of
these
periodical
visits
which
were
usually
of
two
or
three
days
duration
after
dinner
as
his
sister
was
sitting
at
work
by
an
open
window
which
looked
upon
a
little
side
inclosure
filled
with
she
was
startled
by
observing
some
object
opposite
the
window
between
her
and
the
light
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
her
brother
thomas
he
was
without
his
horse
and
carried
his
saddle
upon
his
shoulders
surprised
that
she
had
not
heard
the
gate
opening
for
his
entrance
and
also
at
his
singular
appearance
laden
in
that
manner
she
addressed
him
and
inquired
what
had
happened
and
why
he
had
returned
so
soon
he
made
her
no
reply
but
looked
earnestly
in
her
face
as
he
moved
slowly
along
the
paved
walk
that
led
to
the
stables
she
waited
a
few
moments
expecting
he
would
reappear
to
give
an
account
of
himself
and
his
adventures
but
at
length
growing
impatient
at
his
delay
she
put
down
her
work
and
went
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
to
find
him
the
first
person
she
met
was
her
mother
have
you
seen
thomas
she
inquired
thomas
he
has
gone
to
the
river
trench
no
he
has
returned
i
saw
him
pass
the
window
not
fifteen
minutes
since
then
he
will
be
in
presently
his
sister
however
could
not
wait
she
proceeded
to
the
stables
she
searched
in
all
directions
no
thomas
no
horse
no
saddle
she
made
inquiry
of
the
domestics
no
one
had
seen
him
she
then
returned
and
told
her
mother
what
had
happened
you
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
it
said
her
mother
no
indeed
i
was
wide
awake
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
gave
me
no
answer
but
such
a
look
all
the
afternoon
she
felt
an
uneasiness
she
could
not
reason
herself
out
of
the
next
morning
came
a
messenger
from
the
river
trench
with
dismal
tidings
the
bodies
of
the
young
man
and
his
horse
had
been
found
drowned
a
short
distance
below
the
ford
of
the
river
it
appeared
that
on
arriving
at
the
bank
of
the
river
he
found
it
swollen
beyond
its
usual
depth
by
the
recent
rains
it
being
necessary
to
swim
the
stream
with
his
horse
he
had
taken
off
his
clothes
and
made
them
into
a
packet
which
he
fastened
upon
his
shoulders
it
was
supposed
that
the
strength
of
the
rapid
torrent
displaced
the
bundle
which
thus
served
to
draw
his
head
under
water
and
keep
it
there
without
the
power
of
raising
it
all
this
was
gathered
from
the
position
and
appearance
of
the
bodies
when
found
from
the
time
at
which
he
had
been
seen
passing
a
house
which
stood
near
the
stream
on
his
way
to
the
ford
it
was
evident
that
he
must
have
met
his
fate
at
the
very
moment
his
sister
saw
or
thought
she
saw
him
passing
before
her
i
could
not
but
suggest
the
inquiry
when
these
sad
particulars
were
narrated
to
me
mother
is
it
not
possible
this
might
have
been
a
dream
a
dream
no
indeed
my
child
i
was
perfectly
wide
awake
as
much
so
as
i
am
at
this
moment
i
am
not
superstitious
i
have
never
believed
in
ghosts
or
witches
but
nothing
can
ever
persuade
me
that
this
was
not
a
warning
sent
from
god
to
prepare
me
for
my
brother
death
and
those
who
knew
her
rational
good
sense
her
freedom
from
fancies
or
fears
and
the
calm
that
never
deserted
her
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
would
almost
be
won
to
view
the
matter
in
the
light
she
did
the
order
for
the
evacuation
of
port
dearborn
and
the
removal
of
the
troops
to
fort
howard
green
bay
had
now
been
received
the
family
circle
was
to
be
broken
up
our
mother
our
sister
mrs
helm
and
her
little
son
were
to
return
with
us
to
fort
winnebago
the
other
members
of
the
family
except
robert
were
to
move
with
the
command
to
green
bay
the
schooner
napoleon
was
to
be
sent
from
detroit
to
convey
the
troops
with
their
goods
and
chattels
to
their
destined
post
our
immediate
party
was
to
make
the
journey
by
land
we
were
to
choose
however
a
shorter
and
pleasanter
route
than
the
one
we
had
taken
in
coming
hither
my
husband
with
his
frenchmen
petaille
grignon
and
simon
lecuyer
had
arrived
and
all
hands
were
now
busily
occupied
with
the
necessary
preparations
for
breaking
up
and
removal
i
should
be
doing
injustice
to
the
hospitable
settlers
of
hickory
creek
were
i
to
pass
by
without
notice
an
entertainment
with
which
they
honored
our
chicago
beaux
about
this
time
the
was
to
be
a
ball
and
the
five
single
gentlemen
of
chicago
were
invited
dole
who
was
a
declined
lieutenant
foster
was
on
duty
but
he
did
what
was
still
better
than
accepting
the
invitation
he
loaned
his
beautiful
horse
to
medard
beaubien
who
with
robert
kinzie
and
gholson
kercheval
promised
himself
much
fun
in
eclipsing
the
beaux
and
creating
a
sensation
among
the
belles
of
hickory
creek
chicago
was
then
as
now
looked
upon
as
the
city
its
few
inhabitants
were
supposed
to
have
seen
something
of
the
world
and
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
the
arrival
of
the
smart
and
dashing
young
men
was
an
event
looked
forward
to
with
more
satisfaction
by
the
fair
of
the
little
settlement
than
by
the
swains
whose
rivals
they
might
become
the
day
arrived
and
the
gentlemen
set
off
in
high
spirits
they
took
care
to
be
in
good
season
for
the
dancing
was
to
commence
at
two
in
the
afternoon
they
were
well
mounted
each
priding
himself
upon
the
animal
he
rode
and
they
wore
their
best
suits
as
became
city
gallants
who
were
bent
on
cutting
out
their
less
fashionable
neighbors
and
breaking
the
hearts
of
the
admiring
country
damsels
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
appointed
they
were
received
with
great
politeness
their
steeds
were
taken
care
of
and
a
dinner
was
provided
them
after
which
they
were
ushered
into
the
all
the
beauty
of
the
neighboring
precincts
was
assembled
the
ladies
were
for
the
most
part
white
or
what
passed
for
such
with
an
occasional
dash
of
copper
color
there
was
no
lack
of
bombazet
gowns
and
large
white
perfumed
with
oil
of
cinnamon
and
as
they
took
their
places
in
long
rows
on
the
puncheon
floor
they
were
a
merry
and
a
happy
company
but
the
city
gentlemen
grew
more
and
more
gallant
the
girls
more
and
more
delighted
with
their
attentions
the
country
swains
alas
more
and
more
scowling
and
jealous
in
vain
they
and
in
vain
they
nearly
dislocated
hips
and
shoulders
at
hoe
corn
and
dig
potatoes
they
had
the
mortification
to
perceive
that
the
smart
young
sprigs
from
chicago
had
their
pick
and
choose
among
their
very
sweethearts
and
that
they
themselves
were
fairly
danced
off
the
ground
the
revelry
lasted
until
daylight
and
it
was
now
time
to
think
of
returning
there
was
no
one
ready
with
obliging
politeness
to
bring
them
their
horses
from
the
stable
poor
fellows
said
one
of
the
party
with
a
compassionate
sort
of
laugh
they
could
not
stand
it
they
have
gone
home
to
bed
serves
them
right
said
another
they
better
not
ask
us
down
among
their
girls
again
they
groped
their
way
to
the
stable
and
went
in
there
were
some
animals
standing
at
the
manger
but
evidently
not
their
horses
what
could
they
be
had
the
rogues
been
trying
to
cheat
them
by
putting
these
strange
nondescripts
into
their
place
they
led
them
forth
into
the
gray
of
the
morning
and
then
such
a
trio
as
met
their
gaze
there
were
the
original
bodies
it
is
true
but
where
were
their
manes
and
tails
a
scrubby
pickety
ridge
along
the
neck
and
a
bare
stump
projecting
behind
were
all
that
remained
of
the
flowing
honors
with
which
they
had
come
gallivanting
down
to
bear
away
the
bell
at
hickory
creek
or
in
the
emphatic
language
of
the
country
to
take
the
rag
off
the
bush
gholson
sat
down
on
a
log
and
cried
outright
medard
took
the
matter
more
philosophically
the
horse
was
none
of
his
it
was
lieutenant
foster
robert
characteristically
looked
around
to
see
whom
he
could
knock
down
on
the
occasion
but
there
was
no
one
visible
on
whom
to
wreak
their
vengeance
the
bumpkins
had
stolen
away
and
in
some
safe
quiet
nook
were
snugly
enjoying
their
triumph
and
doubtless
the
deceitful
fair
ones
were
by
this
time
at
their
sides
sharing
their
mirth
and
exultation
the
unlucky
gallants
mounted
their
steeds
and
set
their
faces
homeward
never
was
there
a
more
crestfallen
and
cavalcade
the
poor
horses
seemed
to
realize
that
they
had
met
the
same
treatment
as
the
messengers
of
king
david
at
the
hands
of
the
hanun
they
hung
their
heads
and
evidently
wished
that
they
could
have
tarried
at
jericho
for
a
season
unfortunately
there
was
in
those
days
no
back
way
by
which
they
could
steal
in
unobserved
across
the
prairie
in
view
of
the
whole
community
must
their
approach
be
made
and
to
add
to
their
confusion
in
the
rarity
of
stirring
events
it
was
the
custom
of
the
whole
settlement
to
turn
out
and
welcome
the
arrival
of
any
as
hasty
a
retreat
as
possible
was
beaten
amid
the
shouts
the
jeers
and
the
condolences
of
their
acquaintances
and
it
is
on
record
that
these
three
young
gentlemen
were
in
no
hurry
to
accept
at
any
future
time
an
invitation
to
partake
of
the
festivities
of
hickory
creek
in
due
time
the
napoleon
made
her
appearance
alas
that
this
great
name
should
be
used
in
the
feminine
gender
as
there
was
at
this
period
no
harbor
vessels
anchored
outside
the
bar
or
tongue
of
land
which
formed
the
left
bank
of
the
river
and
the
lading
and
unlading
were
carried
on
by
boats
pulling
in
and
out
through
the
mouth
of
the
river
some
distance
below
of
course
it
always
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
get
a
vessel
loaded
as
quickly
as
possible
that
she
might
be
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
fair
wind
and
be
off
from
such
an
exposed
and
hazardous
for
this
reason
we
had
lived
for
many
days
intending
only
to
see
our
friends
safe
on
board
and
then
commence
our
own
journey
back
to
fort
winnebago
our
heavy
articles
of
furniture
trunks
etc
had
been
sent
on
board
the
napoleon
to
be
brought
round
to
us
by
way
of
fox
river
we
had
retained
only
such
few
necessaries
as
could
be
conveniently
carried
on
a
and
in
a
light
dearborn
wagon
lately
brought
by
kercheval
from
detroit
the
first
luxury
of
the
kind
ever
seen
on
the
prairies
and
which
my
husband
had
purchased
as
an
agreeable
mode
of
conveyance
for
his
mother
and
little
nephew
it
was
a
matter
requiring
no
small
amount
of
time
and
labor
to
transport
in
the
slow
method
described
the
effects
of
so
many
families
of
officers
and
soldiers
with
the
various
etceteras
incident
to
a
total
change
and
removal
it
was
all
however
happily
accomplished
everything
even
to
the
last
article
sent
on
board
nothing
remaining
on
shore
but
the
passengers
whose
turn
it
would
be
next
it
was
a
moment
of
great
relief
for
captain
hinckley
had
been
in
a
fever
and
a
fuss
many
hours
predicting
a
change
of
weather
and
murmuring
at
what
he
thought
the
unnecessary
amount
of
to
be
taken
on
board
those
who
had
leisure
to
be
looking
out
towards
the
schooner
which
had
continued
anchored
about
half
a
mile
out
in
the
lake
had
at
this
crisis
the
satisfaction
to
see
her
hoist
sail
and
leave
her
station
for
the
open
lake
those
who
were
a
little
later
could
just
discern
her
bearing
away
to
a
distance
as
if
she
had
got
all
on
board
that
she
had
any
idea
of
taking
here
we
were
and
here
we
might
remain
a
week
or
more
if
it
so
pleased
captain
hinckley
and
the
schooner
napoleon
and
the
good
east
wind
which
was
blowing
with
all
its
might
there
was
plenty
of
provisions
to
be
obtained
so
the
fear
of
starvation
was
not
the
trouble
but
how
were
the
cooking
and
the
table
to
be
provided
for
various
expedients
were
resorted
to
engle
in
her
quarters
ate
her
breakfast
off
a
shingle
with
her
husband
and
when
she
had
finished
sent
them
down
to
lieutenant
foster
for
his
accommodation
we
were
at
the
old
mansion
on
the
north
side
and
the
news
soon
flew
up
the
river
that
the
napoleon
had
gone
off
with
the
plunder
and
left
the
people
behind
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
supplied
by
portier
our
kind
victoire
with
dishes
knives
forks
and
all
the
other
conveniences
which
our
failed
to
supply
this
state
of
things
lasted
a
couple
of
days
and
then
early
one
fine
morning
the
gratifying
intelligence
spread
like
that
the
napoleon
was
at
anchor
out
beyond
the
bar
there
was
no
unnecessary
delay
this
time
and
at
an
early
hour
in
the
afternoon
we
had
taken
leave
of
our
dear
friends
and
they
were
sailing
away
from
chicago
chapter
xxiv
return
to
fort
winnebago
a
great
part
of
the
command
with
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
officers
and
soldiers
had
a
day
or
two
previous
to
the
time
of
our
departure
set
out
on
their
march
by
land
to
green
bay
fort
winnebago
lieutenant
foster
under
whose
charge
they
were
had
lingered
behind
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
joining
our
party
and
we
in
turn
had
delayed
in
order
to
see
the
other
members
of
our
family
safely
on
board
the
napoleon
but
now
all
things
being
ready
we
set
our
faces
once
more
homeward
we
took
with
us
a
little
josette
a
bright
pretty
child
of
ten
years
of
age
a
daughter
of
ouilmette
a
frenchman
who
had
lived
here
at
the
time
of
the
massacre
and
of
a
pottowattamie
mother
she
had
been
at
the
joseph
under
mccoy
and
she
was
now
full
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
a
journey
all
the
way
to
the
portage
with
monsieur
and
madame
john
we
had
also
a
negro
boy
harry
brought
a
year
before
from
kentucky
by
kercheval
in
the
transfer
at
that
time
from
a
slave
state
to
a
free
one
harry
position
became
somewhat
changed
he
could
be
no
more
than
an
indentured
servant
he
was
about
to
become
a
member
of
household
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
choose
a
guardian
all
this
was
explained
to
him
on
his
being
brought
into
the
parlor
where
the
family
were
assembled
my
husband
was
then
a
young
man
on
a
visit
to
his
home
now
harry
it
was
said
to
him
you
must
choose
your
guardian
and
the
natural
expectation
was
that
harry
would
select
the
person
of
his
acquaintance
of
the
greatest
age
and
dignity
but
rolling
round
his
great
eyes
and
hanging
his
head
on
one
side
he
said
i
have
master
john
for
my
guardian
from
that
day
forward
harry
felt
as
if
he
belonged
in
a
measure
to
master
john
and
at
the
of
the
family
in
chicago
he
was
naturally
transferred
to
our
establishment
there
were
three
ladies
of
our
travelling
party
our
mother
our
sister
mrs
helm
and
myself
to
guard
against
the
burning
effect
of
the
sun
and
the
prairie
winds
upon
our
faces
i
had
during
some
of
the
last
days
of
my
visit
prepared
for
each
of
us
a
mask
of
brown
linen
with
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
fitted
to
our
features
and
to
enhance
their
hideousness
i
had
worked
eyebrows
eyelashes
and
a
circle
around
the
opening
for
the
mouth
in
black
silk
gathered
in
plaits
under
the
chin
and
with
strings
to
confine
them
above
and
below
they
furnished
a
complete
protection
against
the
sun
and
wind
though
nothing
can
be
imagined
more
frightful
than
the
appearance
we
presented
when
fully
equipped
it
was
who
should
be
called
the
ugliest
we
left
amid
the
good
wishes
and
laughter
of
our
few
remaining
acquaintances
our
wagon
had
been
provided
with
a
pair
of
excellent
travelling
horses
and
sister
margaret
and
myself
being
accommodated
with
the
best
pacers
the
country
could
afford
we
set
off
in
high
spirits
towards
the
aux
plaines
our
old
friend
billy
caldwell
the
with
our
brother
robert
and
gholson
kercheval
accompanying
us
to
that
point
of
our
journey
there
was
no
one
at
barney
lawton
when
we
reached
there
save
a
frenchman
and
a
small
number
of
indians
my
sister
and
i
dismounted
and
entered
the
dwelling
the
door
of
which
stood
open
two
indians
were
seated
on
the
floor
smoking
they
raised
their
eyes
as
we
appeared
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
expression
of
wonder
and
horror
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
both
their
lips
relaxed
until
the
pipe
of
one
fell
upon
the
floor
their
eyes
seemed
starting
from
their
heads
and
raising
their
outspread
hands
as
if
to
wave
us
from
them
they
slowly
ejaculated
a
spirit
as
we
raised
our
masks
and
smiling
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
them
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
fairly
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
our
familiar
faces
maman
was
their
salutation
and
they
instantly
plunged
out
of
doors
to
relate
to
their
companions
what
had
happened
our
afternoon
ride
was
over
a
prairie
stretching
away
to
the
northeast
no
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
upon
its
broad
expanse
but
flying
and
circling
over
our
heads
were
innumerable
flocks
of
curlews
screaming
their
wild
notes
to
the
listening
waste
their
peculiar
shrill
cry
of
crack
crack
crack
rackety
rackety
rackety
repeated
from
the
throats
of
dozens
as
they
sometimes
stooped
quite
close
to
our
ears
became
at
length
almost
unbearable
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
lost
their
senses
in
the
excitement
of
so
unusual
and
splendid
a
cortége
in
their
hitherto
desolate
domain
the
accelerated
pace
of
our
horses
as
we
approached
a
beautiful
wooded
knoll
warned
us
that
this
was
to
be
our
place
of
repose
for
the
night
these
animals
seem
to
know
by
instinct
a
favorable
and
this
was
one
of
the
most
lovely
imaginable
the
trees
which
near
the
lake
had
owing
to
the
coldness
and
tardiness
of
the
season
presented
the
appearance
of
unfledged
goslings
were
here
bursting
into
full
leaf
the
ground
around
was
carpeted
with
flowers
we
could
not
bear
to
have
them
crushed
by
the
felling
of
a
tree
and
the
pitching
of
our
tent
among
them
the
birds
sent
forth
their
sweetest
notes
in
the
warm
lingering
sunlight
and
the
opening
buds
of
the
young
hickory
and
sassafras
filled
the
air
with
perfume
nothing
could
be
more
perfect
than
our
enjoyment
of
this
sylvan
and
beautiful
retreat
after
our
ride
in
the
glowing
sun
the
children
were
in
ecstasies
they
delighted
to
find
ways
of
making
themselves
useful
to
pile
up
the
saddles
to
break
boughs
for
the
fire
to
fill
the
little
kettles
with
water
for
petaille
and
lecuyer
the
frenchmen
who
were
preparing
our
supper
their
amusement
at
the
awkward
movements
of
the
horses
after
they
were
spancelled
knew
no
bounds
to
our
little
nephew
edwin
everything
was
new
and
josette
who
had
already
made
more
than
one
horseback
journey
to
joseph
manifested
all
the
pride
of
an
old
traveller
in
explaining
to
him
whatever
was
novel
or
unaccountable
they
were
not
the
last
to
spring
up
at
the
call
how
how
on
the
following
morning
the
fire
was
replenished
the
preparations
for
breakfast
commenced
and
the
frenchmen
dispatched
to
bring
up
the
horses
in
readiness
for
an
early
start
harry
and
josette
played
their
parts
under
our
direction
in
preparing
the
simple
meal
and
we
soon
seated
ourselves
each
with
cup
and
knife
around
the
the
meal
was
over
but
no
men
no
horses
appeared
when
another
had
passed
my
husband
took
harry
and
commenced
exploring
in
search
of
the
missing
ones
the
day
wore
on
and
first
one
and
then
another
would
make
his
appearance
to
report
progress
petaille
and
lecuyer
at
length
brought
two
of
the
horses
but
the
others
could
nowhere
be
found
in
time
kinzie
and
harry
returned
wet
to
their
knees
by
the
dew
upon
the
long
but
with
no
tidings
again
the
men
were
dispatched
after
having
broken
their
fast
but
returned
unsuccessful
as
before
the
morning
had
been
passed
by
our
party
at
the
encampment
in
speculating
upon
the
missing
animals
could
they
have
been
stolen
by
the
indians
hardly
these
people
seldom
committed
robberies
in
time
of
peace
never
upon
our
family
whom
they
regarded
as
their
best
friends
the
horses
would
doubtless
be
found
they
had
probably
been
carelessly
fastened
the
preceding
evening
and
had
therefore
been
able
to
stray
farther
than
was
their
wont
a
council
was
held
at
which
it
was
decided
to
send
grignon
back
to
chicago
to
get
some
fresh
horses
from
gholson
kercheval
and
return
as
speedily
as
possible
if
on
his
return
our
encampment
were
deserted
he
might
conclude
we
had
found
the
horses
and
proceeded
to
fox
river
where
he
would
doubtless
overtake
us
he
had
not
been
gone
more
than
an
hour
before
slowly
hopping
out
of
a
point
of
woods
to
the
north
of
us
a
spot
which
each
of
the
seekers
averred
he
had
explored
over
and
over
again
and
making
directly
for
the
place
where
we
were
appeared
the
vexatious
animals
they
came
up
as
demurely
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
seemed
rather
surprised
to
be
received
with
a
hearty
scolding
instead
of
being
patted
and
caressed
as
usual
it
was
the
work
of
a
very
short
to
strike
and
pack
the
tent
stow
away
the
mats
and
kettles
saddle
the
horses
and
mount
for
our
journey
whoever
pleases
may
take
my
place
in
the
carriage
said
our
mother
i
have
travelled
so
many
years
on
horseback
that
i
find
any
other
mode
of
conveyance
too
fatiguing
so
spite
of
her
sixty
years
she
mounted
sister
margaret
pacer
with
the
activity
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
lieutenant
foster
had
left
us
early
in
the
morning
feeling
it
necessary
to
rejoin
his
command
and
now
having
seen
us
ready
to
set
off
with
a
serene
sky
above
us
and
all
things
right
and
tight
for
the
journey
our
friend
the
took
leave
of
us
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
chicago
we
pursued
our
way
through
a
lovely
country
of
alternate
glade
and
forest
until
we
reached
the
fox
river
the
current
ran
clear
and
rippling
along
and
as
we
descended
the
steep
bank
to
the
water
the
question
so
natural
to
a
traveller
in
an
unknown
region
presented
itself
is
it
fordable
petaille
to
whom
the
ground
was
familiar
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
lecuyer
was
quite
ignorant
upon
the
subject
the
troops
had
evidently
preceded
us
by
this
very
trail
true
but
they
were
on
horseback
the
difficulty
was
could
we
get
the
carriage
through
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
doubt
was
not
about
the
depth
of
the
water
but
about
the
hardness
of
the
bottom
of
the
stream
it
was
agreed
that
two
or
three
of
the
equestrians
should
make
the
trial
first
my
mother
lecuyer
and
myself
advanced
cautiously
across
to
the
opposite
bank
each
choosing
a
different
point
for
leaving
the
water
in
order
to
find
the
firmest
spot
the
bottom
was
hard
and
firm
until
we
came
near
the
shore
then
it
yielded
a
little
with
one
step
however
we
were
each
on
dry
ground
beau
called
my
husband
who
was
driving
oui
monsieur
yes
john
come
just
here
it
is
perfectly
good
no
no
go
a
little
farther
down
see
the
white
gravel
just
there
it
will
be
firmer
still
there
such
were
the
contradictory
directions
given
he
chose
the
latter
and
when
it
wanted
but
one
step
more
to
the
bank
down
sunk
both
horses
until
little
more
than
their
backs
were
visible
the
white
gravel
proved
to
be
a
bed
of
treacherous
yellow
clay
which
gleaming
through
the
water
had
caused
so
unfortunate
a
deception
with
frantic
struggles
for
they
were
nearly
suffocated
with
mud
and
water
the
horses
made
desperate
efforts
to
free
themselves
from
the
harness
my
husband
sprang
out
upon
the
pole
some
one
give
me
a
knife
he
cried
i
was
back
in
the
water
in
a
moment
and
approaching
as
near
as
i
dared
handed
him
mine
from
the
scabbard
around
my
neck
whatever
you
do
do
not
cut
the
traces
cried
his
mother
he
severed
some
of
the
when
just
as
he
had
reached
the
extremity
of
the
pole
and
was
stretching
forward
to
separate
the
one
of
the
horses
gave
a
furious
plunge
which
caused
his
fellow
to
rear
and
throw
himself
nearly
backwards
my
husband
was
between
them
for
a
moment
we
thought
he
was
gone
trampled
down
by
the
excited
animals
but
he
presently
showed
himself
nearly
obscured
by
the
mud
and
water
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
harry
who
was
near
him
now
sprang
forward
on
the
pole
and
in
an
instant
with
his
sharp
which
he
had
ready
divided
the
straps
that
confined
their
heads
the
horses
were
at
this
moment
lying
floating
on
the
water
one
apparently
dead
the
other
as
if
gasping
out
his
last
breath
but
hardly
did
they
become
sensible
of
the
release
of
their
heads
from
bondage
than
they
made
simultaneously
another
furious
effort
to
free
themselves
from
the
pole
to
which
they
were
still
attached
by
the
failing
in
this
they
tried
another
expedient
and
by
a
few
judicious
twists
and
turns
succeeded
in
wrenching
the
pole
asunder
and
finally
carried
it
off
in
triumph
across
the
river
again
and
up
the
bank
where
they
stood
waiting
to
decide
what
were
the
next
steps
to
be
taken
here
was
a
predicament
a
few
hours
before
we
had
thought
ourselves
uncomfortable
enough
because
some
of
our
horses
were
missing
now
a
greater
evil
had
befallen
us
the
wagon
was
in
the
river
the
harness
cut
to
pieces
and
what
was
worse
carried
off
in
the
most
independent
manner
by
tom
and
his
companion
the
pole
was
twisted
to
fragments
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
stick
on
our
side
of
the
river
with
which
to
replace
it
at
this
moment
a
whoop
from
the
opposite
bank
echoed
by
two
or
three
hearty
ones
from
our
party
announced
the
reappearance
of
petaille
grignon
he
dismounted
and
took
charge
of
the
horses
who
were
resting
themselves
after
their
fatigues
under
a
shady
tree
and
by
this
time
lecuyer
had
crossed
the
river
and
now
joined
him
in
bringing
back
the
delinquents
in
the
mean
time
we
had
been
doing
our
best
to
minister
to
our
sister
margaret
she
with
her
little
son
edwin
had
been
in
the
wagon
at
the
time
of
the
accident
and
it
had
been
a
work
of
some
difficulty
to
get
them
out
and
bring
them
on
horseback
to
shore
the
effect
of
the
agitation
and
excitement
was
to
throw
her
into
a
fit
of
the
ague
and
she
now
lay
blue
and
trembling
among
the
long
grass
of
the
little
prairie
which
extended
along
the
bank
the
tent
which
had
been
packed
in
the
rear
of
the
wagon
was
too
much
saturated
with
mud
and
water
to
admit
of
its
being
used
as
a
shelter
it
could
only
be
stretched
in
the
sun
to
dry
we
opened
an
umbrella
over
our
poor
sister
head
and
now
began
a
discussion
of
ways
and
means
to
repair
damages
the
first
thing
was
to
cut
a
new
pole
for
the
wagon
and
for
this
the
master
and
men
must
recross
the
river
and
choose
an
out
of
the
forest
then
for
the
harness
with
provident
care
a
little
box
had
been
placed
under
the
seat
of
the
wagon
containing
an
awl
waxed
ends
and
various
other
little
conveniences
exactly
suited
to
an
emergency
like
the
present
it
was
question
and
answer
like
cock
robin
who
can
mend
the
harness
i
can
for
i
learned
when
i
was
a
young
girl
to
make
shoes

and
i
can
surely
now
as
a
matter
of
usefulness
and
duty
put
all
those
wet
dirty
pieces
of
leather
together
so
we
all
seated
ourselves
on
the
grass
under
the
shade
of
the
only
two
umbrellas
we
could
muster
i
stitched
away
diligently
blistering
my
hands
i
must
own
in
no
small
degree
a
suitable
young
tree
had
been
brought
and
the
hatchets
without
which
one
never
travels
in
the
woods
were
busy
fashioning
it
into
shape
when
a
peculiar
hissing
noise
was
heard
and
instantly
the
cry
serpent
a
rattlesnake
all
sprang
to
their
feet
even
the
poor
shaking
invalid
just
in
time
to
see
the
reptile
glide
past
within
three
inches
of
my
mother
feet
while
the
men
assailed
the
spot
it
had
left
with
whips
missiles
and
whatever
would
help
along
the
commotion
this
little
incident
proved
an
excellent
remedy
for
the
ague
one
excitement
drives
away
another
and
by
means
of
this
upon
the
homoeopathic
principle
sister
margaret
was
so
much
improved
that
by
the
time
all
the
mischiefs
were
repaired
she
was
ready
to
take
her
place
in
the
cavalcade
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
the
rest
of
us
so
great
had
been
the
delay
occasioned
by
all
these
untoward
circumstances
that
our
afternoon
ride
was
but
a
short
one
bringing
us
no
farther
than
the
shores
of
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
now
known
as
crystal
lake
its
clear
surface
was
covered
with
loons
and
a
species
of
rail
with
which
at
certain
seasons
this
region
abounds
the
indians
have
the
genius
of
aesop
for
depicting
animal
life
and
character
and
there
is
among
them
a
fable
or
legend
illustrative
of
every
peculiarity
in
the
personal
appearance
habits
or
dispositions
of
each
variety
of
the
animal
creation
the
back
of
the
little
rail
is
very
concave
or
hollow
the
indians
tell
us
that
it
became
so
in
the
following
manner
story
of
the
little
rail
or
there
is
supposed
by
most
of
the
northwestern
tribes
to
exist
an
invisible
being
corresponding
to
the
genie
of
oriental
story
without
being
exactly
the
father
of
evil
is
a
spirit
whose
office
it
is
to
punish
what
is
amiss
he
is
represented
too
as
constantly
occupied
in
entrapping
and
making
examples
of
all
the
animals
that
come
in
his
way
one
pleasant
evening
as
he
walked
along
the
banks
of
a
lake
he
saw
a
flock
of
ducks
sailing
and
enjoying
themselves
on
the
blue
waters
he
called
to
them
ho
come
with
me
into
my
lodge
and
i
will
teach
you
to
dance
some
of
the
ducks
said
among
themselves
it
is
let
us
not
go
others
were
of
a
contrary
opinion
and
his
words
being
fair
and
his
voice
insinuating
a
few
turned
their
faces
towards
the
land
all
the
rest
soon
followed
and
with
many
pleasant
quackings
trooped
after
him
and
entered
his
lodge
when
there
he
first
took
an
indian
sack
with
a
wide
mouth
which
he
tied
by
the
strings
around
his
neck
so
that
it
would
hang
over
his
shoulders
leaving
the
mouth
unclosed
then
placing
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
lodge
he
ranged
the
ducks
in
a
circle
around
him
now
said
he
you
must
all
shut
your
eyes
whoever
opens
his
eyes
at
all
something
dreadful
will
happen
to
him
i
will
take
my
indian
flute
and
play
upon
it
and
you
will
at
the
word
i
shall
give
open
your
eyes
and
commence
dancing
as
you
see
me
do
the
ducks
obeyed
shutting
their
eyes
and
keeping
time
to
the
music
by
stepping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
all
impatient
for
the
dancing
to
begin
presently
a
sound
was
heard
like
a
smothered
quack
but
the
ducks
did
not
dare
to
open
their
eyes
again
and
again
the
sound
of
the
flute
would
be
interrupted
and
a
gurgling
cry
of
be
heard
there
was
one
little
duck
much
smaller
than
the
rest
who
at
this
juncture
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
open
one
eye
cautiously
she
saw
as
he
played
his
flute
holding
it
with
one
hand
stoop
a
little
at
intervals
and
seize
the
duck
nearest
him
which
he
throttled
and
stuffed
into
the
bag
on
his
shoulders
so
edging
a
little
out
of
the
circle
and
getting
nearer
the
door
which
had
been
left
partly
open
to
admit
the
light
she
cried
out
open
your
eyes
is
choking
you
all
and
putting
you
into
his
bag
with
that
she
flew
but
pounced
upon
her
his
hand
grasped
her
back
yet
with
desperate
force
she
released
herself
and
gained
the
open
air
her
companions
flew
quacking
and
screaming
after
her
some
escaped
and
some
fell
victims
to
the
sprite
the
little
duck
had
saved
her
life
but
she
had
lost
her
beauty
she
ever
after
retained
the
attitude
she
had
been
forced
into
in
her
moment
of
danger
her
back
pressed
down
in
the
centre
and
her
head
and
neck
unnaturally
stretched
forward
into
the
air
chapter
xxv
return
journey
continued
the
third
day
of
our
journey
rose
brilliantly
clear
like
the
two
preceding
ones
and
we
shaped
our
course
more
to
the
north
than
we
had
hitherto
done
in
the
direction
of
lake
now
known
by
the
somewhat
hackneyed
appellation
lake
of
geneva
our
journey
this
day
was
without
mishaps
or
disasters
of
any
kind
the
air
was
balmy
the
foliage
of
the
forests
fresh
and
fragrant
the
little
brooks
clear
and
sparkling
everything
in
nature
spoke
the
praises
of
the
beneficent
creator
it
is
in
scenes
like
this
far
removed
from
the
bustle
the
strife
and
the
sin
of
civilized
life
that
we
most
fully
realize
the
presence
of
the
great
author
of
the
universe
here
can
the
mind
most
fully
adore
his
majesty
and
goodness
for
here
only
is
the
command
obeyed
let
all
the
earth
keep
silence
before
him
it
can
not
escape
observation
that
the
deepest
and
most
solemn
devotion
is
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
shut
out
from
the
worship
of
god
in
temples
made
with
hands
are
led
to
commune
with
him
amid
the
boundless
magnificence
that
his
own
power
has
framed
this
day
was
not
wholly
without
incident
as
we
stopped
for
our
refreshment
and
dismounting
threw
ourselves
on
the
fresh
herbage
just
at
the
verge
of
a
pleasant
thicket
we
were
startled
by
a
tender
near
us
and
presently
breaking
its
way
through
the
low
branches
there
came
upon
us
a
sweet
little
dappled
fawn
evidently
in
search
of
its
mother
it
did
not
seem
in
the
least
frightened
at
the
sight
of
us
as
poor
selkirk
might
have
been
parodied
it
was
so
unacquainted
with
man
its
tameness
was
charming
to
us
but
the
vociferous
delight
of
the
children
soon
drove
it
bounding
again
into
the
woods
and
all
hopes
of
catching
it
for
a
pet
were
at
once
at
an
end
we
had
travelled
well
this
day
and
were
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
fatigued
when
just
before
sunset
we
came
upon
a
ridge
overlooking
one
of
the
loveliest
little
dells
imaginable
it
was
an
oak
opening
and
browsing
under
the
shade
of
the
tall
trees
which
were
scattered
around
were
the
cattle
and
horses
of
the
soldiers
who
had
got
thus
far
on
their
journey
two
or
three
white
tents
were
pitched
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
beside
a
clear
stream
the
were
already
lighted
and
the
men
singly
or
in
groups
were
busied
in
their
various
preparations
for
their
own
comfort
or
that
of
their
animals
lieutenant
foster
came
forward
with
great
delight
to
welcome
our
arrival
and
accepted
without
hesitation
an
invitation
to
join
our
mess
again
as
long
as
we
should
be
together
we
soon
found
a
pleasant
far
enough
removed
from
the
other
party
to
secure
us
against
all
inconvenience
and
our
supper
having
received
the
addition
of
a
kettle
of
fine
fresh
milk
kindly
brought
us
by
gardiner
the
hospital
matron
who
with
her
little
covered
cart
formed
no
unimportant
feature
in
the
military
group
we
partook
of
our
evening
meal
with
much
hilarity
and
enjoyment
if
people
are
ever
companionable
it
is
when
thrown
together
under
circumstances
like
the
present
there
has
always
been
sufficient
incident
through
the
day
to
furnish
themes
for
discourse
and
subjects
of
merriment
as
long
as
the
company
feel
disposed
for
conversation
which
is
truth
to
tell
not
an
unconscionable
length
of
time
after
their
supper
is
over
the
poor
lieutenant
looked
grave
enough
when
we
set
out
in
advance
of
him
the
next
morning
none
of
his
party
were
acquainted
with
the
road
but
after
giving
him
directions
both
general
and
particular
kinzie
promised
to
a
tree
or
up
a
for
a
guide
at
every
place
which
appeared
more
than
usually
doubtful
we
now
found
ourselves
in
a
much
more
diversified
country
than
any
we
had
hitherto
travelled
gently
swelling
hills
lovely
valleys
and
bright
sparkling
streams
were
the
features
of
the
landscape
but
there
was
little
animate
life
now
and
then
a
shout
from
the
leader
of
the
party
for
according
to
custom
we
travelled
indian
file
would
call
our
attention
to
a
herd
of
deer
loping
as
the
westerners
say
through
the
forest
or
an
additional
spur
would
be
given
to
the
horses
on
the
appearance
of
some
small
dark
object
far
distant
on
the
trail
before
us
but
the
game
invariably
contrived
to
disappear
before
we
could
reach
it
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
leave
the
beaten
track
for
a
regular
hunt
soon
after
we
descended
a
long
sloping
knoll
and
by
a
sudden
turn
came
full
in
view
of
the
beautiful
sheet
of
water
denominated
by
the
french
by
the
natives
and
by
ourselves
from
the
chief
whose
village
overlooked
its
waters
bold
swelling
hills
jutted
forward
into
the
clear
blue
expanse
or
retreated
slightly
to
afford
a
green
level
nook
as
a
for
the
dwelling
of
man
on
the
nearer
shore
stretched
a
bright
gravelly
beach
across
which
coursed
here
and
there
a
pure
sparkling
rivulet
to
join
the
larger
sheet
of
water
on
a
rising
ground
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
bold
bluffs
in
the
middle
distance
a
collection
of
neat
wigwams
formed
with
their
surrounding
gardens
no
unpleasant
feature
in
the
picture
a
shout
of
delight
burst
involuntarily
from
the
whole
party
as
this
charming
landscape
met
our
view
it
was
like
the
hudson
only
less
bold
no
it
was
like
the
lake
of
the
forest
cantons
in
the
picture
of
the
chapel
of
william
tell
what
could
be
imagined
more
enchanting
oh
i
if
our
friends
at
the
east
could
but
enjoy
it
with
us
we
paused
long
to
admire
and
then
spurred
on
skirting
the
head
of
the
lake
and
were
soon
ascending
the
broad
platform
on
which
stood
the
village
of
or
the
inhabitants
who
had
witnessed
our
approach
from
a
distance
were
all
assembled
in
front
of
their
wigwams
to
greet
us
if
friends
if
otherwise
whatever
the
occasion
should
demand
it
was
the
first
time
such
a
spectacle
had
ever
presented
itself
to
their
wondering
eyes
their
salutations
were
not
less
cordial
than
we
expected
and
his
mother
who
was
known
throughout
the
tribe
by
the
touching
appellation
our
friend
wife
were
welcomed
most
kindly
and
an
animated
conversation
commenced
which
i
could
understand
only
so
far
as
it
was
conveyed
by
gestures
so
i
amused
myself
by
taking
a
minute
survey
of
all
that
met
my
view
the
chief
was
a
large
ugly
indian
with
a
countenance
bloated
by
intemperance
and
with
a
sinister
unpleasant
expression
he
had
a
handkerchief
upon
his
head
and
was
otherwise
attired
in
his
best
in
compliment
to
the
strangers
it
was
to
this
chief
that
chambly
or
as
he
is
now
called
billy
caldwell
and
robinson
were
dispatched
by
wolcott
their
agent
during
the
winnebago
war
in
to
use
their
earnest
endeavors
to
prevent
this
chief
and
his
band
from
joining
the
hostile
indians
with
some
difficulty
they
succeeded
and
were
thus
the
means
doubtless
of
saving
the
lives
of
all
the
settlers
who
lived
exposed
upon
the
frontier
among
the
various
groups
of
his
people
there
was
none
attracted
my
attention
so
forcibly
as
a
young
man
of
handsome
face
and
a
figure
that
was
striking
even
where
all
were
fine
and
symmetrical
he
too
had
a
gay
handkerchief
on
his
head
a
shirt
of
the
brightest
calico
an
abundance
of
silver
ornaments
and
what
gave
his
dress
a
most
fanciful
appearance
one
legging
of
blue
and
the
other
of
bright
scarlet
i
was
not
ignorant
that
this
peculiar
feature
in
his
toilet
indicated
a
heart
suffering
from
the
tender
passion
the
flute
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
added
confirmation
to
the
fact
while
the
joyous
animated
expression
of
his
countenance
showed
with
equal
plainness
that
he
was
not
a
despairing
lover
i
could
have
imagined
him
to
have
recently
returned
from
the
chase
laden
with
booty
with
which
he
had
as
is
the
custom
entered
the
lodge
of
the
fair
one
and
thrown
his
burden
at
the
feet
of
her
parents
with
an
indifferent
superb
sort
of
air
as
much
as
to
say
here
is
some
meat
it
is
a
mere
trifle
but
it
will
show
you
what
you
might
expect
with
me
for
a
i
could
not
doubt
that
the
damsel
had
stepped
forward
and
gathered
it
up
in
token
that
she
accepted
the
offering
and
the
donor
along
with
it
there
was
nothing
in
the
appearance
or
manner
of
any
of
the
maidens
by
whom
we
were
surrounded
to
denote
which
was
the
happy
fair
neither
although
i
peered
anxiously
into
all
their
countenances
could
i
there
detect
any
blush
of
consciousness
so
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
selecting
the
youngest
and
prettiest
of
the
group
and
go
on
weaving
my
romance
to
my
own
satisfaction
the
village
stood
encircled
by
an
amphitheatre
of
hills
so
precipitous
and
with
gorges
so
steep
and
narrow
that
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
scale
them
even
on
horseback
how
then
could
we
hope
to
accomplish
the
ascent
of
the
carriage
this
was
the
point
now
under
discussion
between
my
husband
and
the
pottowattamies
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
make
the
effort
selecting
the
pass
that
the
inhabitants
pointed
out
as
the
most
practicable
petaille
went
first
and
i
followed
on
my
favorite
jerry
it
was
such
a
scramble
as
is
not
often
taken
almost
perpendicularly
through
what
seemed
the
dry
bed
of
a
torrent
now
filled
with
loose
stones
and
scarcely
affording
one
secure
foothold
from
the
bottom
to
the
summit
i
clang
fast
to
the
mane
literally
at
times
clasping
jerry
around
his
neck
and
amid
the
encouraging
shouts
and
cheers
of
those
below
we
at
length
arrived
safely
though
nearly
breathless
on
the
pinnacle
and
sat
looking
down
to
view
the
success
of
the
next
party
the
horses
had
been
taken
from
the
carriage
the
luggage
it
contained
being
placed
upon
the
shoulders
of
some
of
the
young
indians
to
be
up
the
steep
ropes
were
now
attached
to
its
sides
and
a
regular
bevy
of
our
red
friends
headed
by
our
two
frenchmen
placed
to
man
them
two
or
three
more
took
their
places
in
the
rear
to
hold
the
vehicle
and
keep
it
from
slipping
backwards
then
the
labor
commenced
such
a
pulling
such
a
shouting
such
a
clapping
of
hands
by
the
spectators
of
both
sexes
such
a
stentorian
word
of
command
or
encouragement
from
the
bourgeois
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
slight
halt
a
wavering
as
if
carriage
and
men
were
about
to
tumble
backwards
into
the
plain
below
but
no
they
would
recover
themselves
and
after
incredible
efforts
they
too
safely
gained
the
above
in
process
of
time
all
were
landed
there
and
having
remunerated
our
friends
to
their
satisfaction
the
goods
and
chattels
were
collected
the
wagon
repacked
and
we
set
off
for
our
encampment
at
turtle
creek
the
exertions
and
excitement
of
our
laborious
ascent
together
with
the
increasing
heat
of
the
sun
made
this
afternoon
ride
more
uncomfortable
than
anything
we
had
previously
felt
we
were
truly
rejoiced
when
the
whoop
of
our
guide
and
the
sight
of
a
few
scattered
lodges
gave
notice
that
we
had
reached
our
we
chose
a
beautiful
sequestered
spot
by
the
side
of
a
clear
sparkling
stream
and
having
dismounted
and
seen
that
our
horses
were
made
comfortable
my
husband
after
giving
his
directions
to
his
men
led
me
to
a
retired
spot
where
i
could
lay
aside
my
hat
and
mask
and
bathe
my
flushed
face
and
aching
head
in
the
cool
refreshing
waters
never
had
i
felt
anything
so
grateful
so
delicious
i
sat
down
and
leaned
my
head
against
one
of
the
tall
overshadowing
trees
and
was
almost
dreaming
when
summoned
to
partake
of
our
evening
meal
the
indians
had
brought
us
as
a
present
some
fine
brook
trout
which
our
frenchmen
had
prepared
in
the
most
tempting
fashion
and
before
the
bright
moon
rose
and
we
were
ready
for
oar
rest
all
headache
and
fatigue
had
alike
disappeared
one
of
the
most
charming
features
of
this
mode
of
travelling
is
the
joyous
vocal
life
of
the
forest
at
early
dawn
when
all
the
feathered
tribe
come
forth
to
pay
their
cheerful
salutations
to
the
opening
day
the
rapid
chattering
flourish
of
the
the
soft
whistle
of
the
thrush
the
tender
coo
of
the
the
deep
warbling
bass
of
the
grouse
the
drumming
of
the
partridge
the
melodious
trill
of
the
lark
the
gay
carol
of
the
robin
the
friendly
familiar
call
of
the
duck
and
the
teal
resound
from
tree
and
knoll
and
lowland
prompting
the
expressive
exclamation
of
the
simple
voilà
la
forêt
qui
parle
it
seems
as
if
man
must
involuntarily
raise
his
voice
to
take
part
in
the
general
chorus
the
mating
song
of
praise
birds
and
flowers
and
the
soft
balmy
airs
of
morning
must
it
not
have
been
in
a
scene
like
this
that
milton
adam
poured
out
his
beautiful
hymn
of
adoration
these
are
thy
glorious
works
parent
of
good
this
day
we
were
journeying
in
hopes
to
reach
at
an
early
hour
that
broad
expanse
of
the
rock
river
which
here
forms
the
the
appellation
of
this
water
rendered
doubly
affecting
by
the
subsequent
fate
of
its
people
imports
lake
we
live
our
road
for
the
early
part
of
the
day
led
through
forests
so
thick
and
tangled
that
grignon
and
lecuyer
were
often
obliged
to
go
in
advance
as
pioneers
with
their
axes
to
cut
away
the
obstructing
shrubs
and
branches
it
was
slow
work
and
at
times
quite
discouraging
but
we
were
through
with
it
at
last
and
then
we
came
into
a
country
of
altogether
a
different
description
low
prairies
intersected
with
deep
narrow
streams
like
canals
the
passage
of
which
either
by
horses
or
carriages
was
often
a
matter
of
delay
and
even
difficulty
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
the
horses
were
to
be
taken
from
the
carriage
and
the
latter
pulled
and
pushed
across
the
deep
narrow
channels
as
best
it
might
the
wooded
banks
of
the
were
never
welcomed
with
greater
delight
than
by
us
when
they
at
length
broke
upon
our
sight
a
ride
of
five
or
six
miles
through
the
beautiful
oak
openings
brought
us
to
village
a
collection
of
neat
bark
wigwams
with
extensive
fields
on
each
side
of
corn
beans
and
squashes
recently
planted
but
already
giving
promise
of
a
fine
crop
in
front
was
the
broad
blue
lake
the
shores
of
which
to
the
south
were
open
and
marshy
but
near
the
village
and
stretching
far
away
to
the
north
were
bordered
by
fine
lofty
trees
the
village
was
built
but
a
short
distance
below
the
point
where
the
rock
river
opens
into
the
lake
and
during
a
conversation
between
our
party
and
the
indians
at
the
village
an
arrangement
was
made
with
them
to
take
us
across
at
a
spot
about
half
a
mile
above
after
a
short
halt
we
again
took
up
our
line
of
march
through
the
woods
along
the
bank
of
the
river
a
number
of
the
winnebagoes
for
we
had
been
among
our
own
people
since
leaving
lake
set
out
for
the
appointed
place
by
water
paddling
their
canoes
of
which
they
had
selected
the
largest
and
strongest
arrived
at
the
spot
indicated
we
dismounted
and
the
men
commenced
the
task
of
unsaddling
and
unloading
we
were
soon
placed
in
the
canoes
and
paddled
across
to
the
opposite
bank
next
the
horses
were
swum
across
after
them
was
to
come
the
carriage
two
long
wooden
canoes
were
securely
lashed
together
side
by
side
and
being
of
sufficient
width
to
admit
of
the
carriage
standing
within
them
the
passage
was
commenced
again
and
again
the
tottering
barks
would
sway
from
side
to
side
and
a
cry
or
a
shout
would
arise
from
our
party
on
shore
as
the
whole
mass
seemed
about
to
plunge
sideways
into
the
water
but
it
would
presently
recover
itself
and
at
length
after
various
deviations
from
the
perpendicular
it
reached
the
shore
in
safety
we
now
hoped
that
our
troubles
were
at
an
end
and
that
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
mount
and
trot
on
as
fast
as
possible
to
fort
winnebago
but
no
half
a
mile
farther
on
was
a
formidable
swamp
of
no
great
width
it
is
true
but
with
a
depth
of
from
two
to
three
feet
of
mud
and
water
it
was
a
question
whether
with
the
carriage
we
could
get
through
it
at
all
several
of
the
indians
accompanied
us
to
this
place
partly
to
give
us
their
aid
and
counsel
and
partly
to
enjoy
the
fun
of
the
spectacle
on
reaching
the
swamp
we
were
disposed
to
laugh
at
the
formidable
representations
which
had
been
made
to
us
we
saw
only
a
strip
of
what
seemed
rather
low
land
covered
with
tall
dry
rushes
it
is
true
the
ground
looked
a
little
wet
but
there
seemed
nothing
to
justify
all
the
apprehensions
that
had
been
excited
great
was
my
surprise
then
to
see
my
husband
who
had
been
a
few
minutes
absent
return
to
our
circle
attired
in
his
duck
trousers
and
without
shoes
or
stockings
what
are
you
going
to
do
inquired
i
carry
you
through
the
swamp
on
my
shoulders
come
petaille
you
are
the
strongest
you
are
to
carry
madame
kinzie
and
there
pointing
to
a
tall
stout
winnebago
he
will
take
madame
helm
wait
a
moment
said
i
and
seating
myself
on
the
grass
i
deliberately
took
off
my
own
boots
and
stockings
what
is
that
for
they
all
asked
because
i
do
not
wish
to
ride
with
wet
feet
all
the
rest
of
the
day
no
danger
of
that
said
they
and
no
one
followed
my
example
by
the
time
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
swamp
however
they
found
my
precaution
had
been
by
no
means
useless
the
water
through
which
our
bearers
had
to
pass
was
of
such
a
depth
that
no
efforts
of
the
ladies
were
sufficient
to
keep
their
feet
above
the
surface
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
my
burden
upon
my
husband
shoulders
was
much
less
from
my
being
able
to
keep
my
first
position
instead
of
changing
constantly
to
avoid
a
contact
with
the
water
the
laugh
was
quite
on
my
side
when
i
resumed
my
equipment
and
mounted
into
my
saddle
it
will
be
perceived
that
journeying
in
the
woods
is
in
some
degree
a
deranger
of
ceremony
and
formality
that
it
necessarily
restricts
us
somewhat
in
our
conventionalities
the
only
remedy
is
to
make
ourselves
amends
by
a
double
share
when
we
return
to
the
civilized
walks
of
life
by
dint
of
much
pulling
shouting
encouraging
and
threatening
the
horses
at
length
dragged
the
carriage
through
the
difficult
pass
and
our
red
friends
were
left
to
return
to
their
village
with
doubtless
a
very
exaggerated
and
amusing
account
of
all
that
they
had
seen
and
assisted
in
we
had
not
forgotten
our
promise
to
lieutenant
foster
to
put
up
a
of
some
sort
for
his
accommodation
in
following
us
we
therefore
upon
several
occasions
carried
with
us
from
the
woods
a
few
pieces
of
three
or
four
feet
in
length
which
we
planted
at
certain
points
with
a
transverse
stick
through
a
cleft
in
the
top
thus
marking
the
direction
he
and
his
party
were
to
take
we
therefore
felt
sure
that
although
a
few
days
later
he
would
find
our
trail
and
avail
himself
of
the
same
assistance
as
we
had
in
getting
through
the
difficulties
of
the
way
our
this
night
was
to
be
not
far
distant
from
the
four
lakes
we
were
greatly
fatigued
with
the
heat
and
exercise
of
the
day
and
most
anxiously
did
we
look
out
for
the
clumps
of
willows
and
alders
which
were
to
mark
the
spot
where
water
would
be
found
we
felt
hardly
equal
to
pushing
on
quite
to
the
bank
of
the
nearest
lake
indeed
it
would
have
taken
us
too
much
off
our
direct
course
when
we
at
a
late
hour
came
upon
a
spot
fit
for
our
purpose
we
exchanged
mutual
congratulations
that
this
was
to
be
our
last
night
upon
the
road
the
next
day
we
should
be
at
winnebago
our
journey
had
been
most
delightful
a
continued
scene
of
exhilaration
and
enjoyment
for
the
various
mishaps
although
for
the
moment
they
had
perplexed
yet
in
the
end
had
but
added
to
our
amusement
still
with
the
inconstancy
of
human
nature
we
were
pleased
to
exchange
its
excitement
for
the
quiet
repose
of
home
our
next
morning
ride
was
of
a
more
tranquil
character
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
for
at
an
early
hour
we
entered
upon
what
was
known
as
the
prairie
and
i
may
be
permitted
to
observe
that
the
miles
are
wonderfully
long
on
the
prairies
our
passage
over
this
was
except
the
absence
of
the
sand
like
crossing
the
desert
mile
after
mile
of
unbroken
expanse
not
a
tree
not
a
living
object
except
ourselves
the
sun
as
if
to
make
himself
amends
for
his
two
months
seclusion
shone
forth
with
redoubled
brilliancy
there
is
no
such
thing
as
carrying
an
umbrella
on
horseback
though
those
in
the
wagon
were
able
to
avail
themselves
of
such
a
shelter
our
mother
energies
had
sustained
her
in
the
saddle
until
this
day
but
she
was
now
fairly
obliged
to
give
in
and
yield
her
place
on
little
brunet
to
sister
margaret
thus
we
went
on
one
little
knoll
rising
beyond
another
from
the
summit
of
each
of
which
in
succession
we
hoped
to
descry
the
distant
woods
which
were
to
us
as
the
promised
land
take
courage
were
the
cheering
words
often
repeated
very
soon
you
will
begin
to
see
the
timber
another
hour
would
pass
heavily
by
now
when
we
reach
the
rising
ground
just
ahead
look
we
would
look
sharp
nothing
but
the
same
unvarying
landscape
there
were
not
even
streams
to
allay
the
feverish
thirst
occasioned
by
fatigue
and
impatience
at
length
a
whoop
from
broke
the
silence
in
which
we
were
pursuing
our
way
le
voilà
there
it
is
our
less
practised
eye
could
not
at
first
discern
the
faint
blue
strip
edging
the
horizon
but
it
grew
and
grew
upon
our
vision
and
fatigue
and
all
discomfort
proportionably
disappeared
we
were
in
fine
spirits
by
the
time
we
reached
hastings
woods
a
noble
forest
watered
by
a
clear
sparkling
stream
grateful
as
was
the
refreshment
of
the
green
foliage
and
the
cooling
waters
we
did
not
allow
ourselves
to
forget
that
the
day
was
wearing
on
and
that
we
must
if
possible
complete
our
journey
before
sunset
so
we
soon
braced
up
our
minds
to
continue
our
route
although
we
would
gladly
have
lingered
another
hour
the
marsh
of
duck
creek
was
thanks
to
the
heat
of
the
past
week
in
a
very
different
state
from
what
it
had
been
a
few
months
previous
when
i
had
been
so
unfortunately
submerged
in
its
icy
waters
we
passed
it
without
difficulty
and
soon
found
ourselves
upon
the
banks
of
the
creek
the
stream
at
this
point
was
supposed
to
be
always
fordable
and
even
were
it
not
so
that
to
the
majority
of
our
party
would
have
been
a
matter
of
little
moment
to
the
ladies
however
the
subject
seemed
to
demand
consideration
this
water
looks
very
deep
are
you
sure
we
can
cross
it
on
horseback
oh
yes
petaille
go
before
and
let
us
see
how
the
water
is
petaille
obeyed
he
was
mounted
on
a
horse
like
a
giraffe
and
extending
his
feet
horizontally
he
certainly
managed
to
pass
through
the
stream
without
much
of
a
wetting
it
seemed
certain
that
the
water
would
come
into
the
wagon
but
that
was
of
the
less
consequence
as
in
case
of
the
worst
the
passengers
could
mount
upon
the
seats
my
horse
jerry
was
above
the
medium
height
so
that
i
soon
passed
over
with
no
inconvenience
but
that
of
being
obliged
to
disengage
my
feet
from
the
stirrups
and
tuck
them
up
snugly
against
the
mane
of
the
horse
sister
margaret
was
still
upon
brunet
she
was
advised
to
change
him
for
one
of
the
taller
horses
but
while
the
matter
was
under
debate
it
was
settled
by
the
perverse
little
wretch
taking
to
the
water
most
unceremoniously
in
obedience
to
the
example
of
the
other
animals
he
was
soon
beyond
his
depth
and
we
were
at
once
alarmed
and
diverted
at
seeing
his
rider
with
surprising
adroitness
draw
her
feet
from
the
stirrups
and
perch
herself
upon
the
top
of
the
saddle
where
she
held
her
position
and
navigated
her
little
refractory
steed
safely
to
land
this
was
the
last
of
our
adventures
a
pleasant
ride
of
four
miles
brought
us
to
the
fort
just
as
the
sun
was
throwing
his
last
beams
over
the
glowing
landscape
and
on
reaching
the
ferry
we
were
at
once
conducted
by
the
friends
who
were
awaiting
us
to
the
hospitable
roof
of
major
twiggs
chapter
xxvi
the
dandy
the
companies
of
the
first
infantry
which
had
hitherto
been
stationed
at
fort
winnebago
had
before
our
arrival
received
orders
to
move
on
to
the
mississippi
as
soon
as
relieved
by
a
portion
of
the
fifth
now
at
fort
howard
as
many
of
the
officers
of
the
latter
regiment
were
married
we
had
reason
to
expect
that
all
the
quarters
at
the
post
would
be
put
in
requisition
for
this
reason
although
strongly
pressed
by
major
twiggs
to
take
up
our
residence
again
in
the
fort
until
he
should
go
on
furlough
we
thought
it
best
to
establish
ourselves
at
once
at
the
agency
it
seemed
laughable
to
give
so
grand
a
name
to
so
very
insignificant
a
concern
we
had
been
promised
by
the
heads
of
department
at
washington
a
comfortable
dwelling
so
soon
as
there
should
be
an
appropriation
by
congress
sufficient
to
cover
any
extra
expense
in
the
indian
department
it
was
evident
that
congress
had
a
great
spite
at
us
for
it
had
delayed
for
two
sessions
attending
to
our
accommodation
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
therefore
but
to
make
ourselves
comfortable
with
the
best
means
in
our
power
the
old
log
barracks
which
had
been
built
for
the
officers
and
soldiers
on
the
first
establishment
of
the
post
two
years
previous
had
been
removed
by
our
french
engagés
and
put
up
again
upon
the
little
hill
opposite
the
fort
to
these
some
additions
were
now
made
in
the
shape
of
dairy
stables
constructed
of
tamarack
logs
brought
from
the
neighboring
swamp
the
whole
presented
a
very
rough
and
primitive
appearance
the
main
building
consisted
of
a
range
of
four
rooms
no
two
of
which
communicated
with
each
other
but
each
opened
by
a
door
into
the
outward
air
a
small
window
cut
through
the
logs
in
front
and
rear
gave
light
to
the
apartment
an
immense
clay
chimney
for
every
two
rooms
occupied
one
side
of
each
and
the
ceiling
overhead
was
composed
of
a
few
rough
boards
laid
upon
the
transverse
logs
that
supported
the
roof
it
was
surprising
how
soon
a
comfortable
homelike
air
was
given
to
the
old
dilapidated
rooms
by
a
few
indian
mats
spread
upon
the
floor
the
piano
and
other
furniture
ranged
in
their
appropriate
places
and
even
a
few
pictures
hung
against
the
logs
the
latter
alas
had
soon
to
be
displaced
for
with
the
first
heavy
shower
the
rain
found
entrance
through
sundry
crevices
and
we
saw
ourselves
obliged
to
put
aside
carefully
everything
that
could
be
injured
by
the
moisture
we
made
light
of
these
evils
however
packed
away
our
carpets
and
superfluous
furniture
upon
the
boards
above
which
we
dignified
with
the
name
of
attic
and
contentedly
resolved
to
await
the
time
when
government
should
condescend
to
remember
us
the
greatest
inconvenience
i
experienced
was
from
the
necessity
of
wearing
my
straw
bonnet
throughout
the
day
as
i
journeyed
from
bedroom
to
parlor
and
from
parlor
to
kitchen
i
became
so
accustomed
to
it
that
i
even
sometimes
forgot
to
remove
it
when
i
sat
down
to
table
or
to
my
quiet
occupations
with
my
mother
and
sister
permission
was
however
in
time
received
to
build
a
house
for
the
blacksmith
that
is
the
person
kept
in
pay
by
the
government
at
this
station
to
mend
the
guns
traps
etc
of
the
indians
it
happened
most
fortunately
for
us
that
monsieur
isidore
morrin
was
a
bachelor
and
quite
satisfied
to
continue
boarding
with
his
friend
louis
frum
manaigre
so
that
when
the
new
house
was
fairly
commenced
we
planned
it
and
hurried
it
forward
entirely
on
our
own
account
it
was
not
very
magnificent
it
is
true
consisting
of
but
a
parlor
and
two
bedrooms
on
the
and
two
low
chambers
under
the
roof
with
a
kitchen
in
the
rear
but
compared
with
the
rambling
old
building
we
now
inhabited
it
seemed
quite
a
palace
before
it
was
completed
kinzie
was
notified
that
the
money
for
the
annual
indian
payment
was
awaiting
his
arrival
in
detroit
to
take
it
in
charge
and
superintend
its
transportation
to
the
portage
and
he
was
obliged
to
set
off
at
once
to
fulfil
this
part
of
his
duty
the
workmen
who
had
been
brought
from
the
mississippi
to
erect
the
main
building
were
fully
competent
to
carry
on
their
work
without
an
overseer
but
the
kitchen
was
to
be
the
task
of
the
frenchmen
and
the
question
was
how
could
it
be
executed
in
the
absence
of
the
you
will
have
to
content
yourselves
in
the
old
quarters
until
my
return
said
my
husband
and
then
we
will
soon
have
things
in
order
his
journey
was
to
be
a
long
and
tedious
one
for
the
operations
of
government
were
not
carried
on
by
railroad
and
telegraph
in
those
days
after
his
departure
i
said
to
the
men
come
you
have
all
your
logs
cut
and
hauled
the
squaws
have
brought
the
bark
for
the
roof
what
is
to
prevent
our
finishing
the
house
and
getting
all
moved
and
settled
to
surprise
monsieur
john
on
his
return
ah
to
be
sure
madame
john
said
plante
who
was
always
the
spokesman
provided
the
one
who
plants
a
green
bough
on
the
is
to
have
a
treat
certainly
all
hands
fall
to
work
and
see
who
will
win
the
treat
upon
the
strength
of
such
an
inducement
to
the
one
who
should
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
building
plante
pillon
and
manaigre
whom
the
waggish
plante
persisted
in
calling
mon
nègre
whenever
he
felt
himself
out
of
the
reach
of
the
other
arm
all
went
vigorously
to
work
building
a
log
house
is
a
somewhat
curious
process
first
as
will
be
conceived
the
logs
are
laid
one
upon
another
and
jointed
at
the
corners
until
the
walls
have
reached
the
required
height
the
chimney
is
formed
by
four
poles
of
the
proper
length
interlaced
with
a
of
small
branches
a
hole
or
pit
is
dug
near
at
hand
and
with
a
mixture
of
clay
and
water
a
sort
of
mortar
is
formed
large
wisps
of
hay
are
filled
with
this
thick
substance
and
fashioned
with
the
hands
into
what
are
technically
called
and
these
are
filled
in
among
the
of
the
chimney
until
not
a
chink
is
left
the
whole
is
then
covered
with
a
smooth
coating
of
the
wet
clay
which
is
denominated
plastering
between
the
logs
which
compose
the
walls
of
the
building
small
bits
of
wood
are
driven
quite
near
together
this
is
called
chinking
and
after
it
is
done
clay
cats
are
introduced
and
smoothed
over
with
the
plaster
when
all
is
dry
both
walls
and
chimney
are
whitewashed
and
present
a
comfortable
and
tidy
appearance
the
roof
is
formed
by
laying
upon
the
transverse
logs
thick
sheets
of
bark
around
the
chimney
for
greater
security
against
the
rain
we
took
care
to
have
placed
a
few
layers
of
the
palisades
that
had
been
left
when
peach
an
odd
little
itinerant
genius
had
fenced
in
our
garden
the
pride
and
wonder
of
the
surrounding
settlement
and
wigwams
while
all
these
matters
were
in
progress
we
received
frequent
visits
from
our
indian
friends
first
and
foremost
among
them
was
the
young
dandy
one
fine
morning
he
made
his
appearance
accompanied
by
two
squaws
whom
he
introduced
as
his
wives
he
could
speak
a
little
chippewa
and
by
this
means
he
and
our
mother
contrived
to
keep
up
something
of
a
conversation
he
was
dressed
in
all
his
finery
brooches
wampum
fan
and
all
the
paint
upon
his
face
and
chest
showed
that
he
had
devoted
no
small
time
to
the
labors
of
his
toilet
he
took
a
chair
as
he
had
seen
done
at
washington
and
made
signs
to
his
women
to
sit
down
upon
the
floor
the
custom
of
taking
two
wives
is
not
very
general
among
the
indians
they
seem
to
have
the
sagacity
to
perceive
that
the
fewer
they
have
to
manage
the
more
complete
is
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
wigwam
nevertheless
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
husband
takes
a
foolish
fancy
for
a
second
squaw
and
in
that
case
he
uses
all
his
cunning
and
eloquence
to
reconcile
the
first
to
receiving
a
new
inmate
in
the
lodge
of
course
it
is
a
matter
that
must
be
managed
adroitly
in
order
that
harmony
may
be
preserved
my
dear
your
health
is
not
very
good
it
is
time
you
should
have
some
rest
you
have
worked
very
hard
and
it
grieves
me
that
you
should
have
to
labor
any
longer
let
me
get
you
some
nice
young
squaw
to
wait
upon
you
that
you
may
live
at
ease
all
the
rest
of
your
life
the
first
wife
consents
indeed
she
has
no
option
if
she
is
of
a
jealous
vindictive
disposition
what
a
life
the
leads
the
old
one
maintains
all
her
rights
of
dowager
and
duenna
and
the
husband
tenderness
is
hardly
a
compensation
for
all
the
evils
the
young
rival
is
made
to
suffer
it
was
on
sunday
morning
that
this
visit
of
the
dandy
was
made
to
us
we
were
all
seated
quietly
engaged
in
reading
inquired
of
my
mother
why
we
were
so
occupied
and
why
everything
around
us
was
so
still
my
mother
explained
to
him
our
observance
of
the
day
of
rest
that
we
devoted
it
to
worshipping
and
serving
the
great
spirit
as
he
had
commanded
in
his
holy
word
gave
a
nod
of
approbation
that
was
very
right
he
said
he
was
glad
to
see
us
doing
our
duty
he
was
very
religious
himself
and
he
liked
to
see
others
so
he
always
took
care
that
his
squaws
attended
to
their
duties
not
reading
perhaps
but
such
as
the
great
spirit
liked
and
such
as
he
thought
proper
and
becoming
he
seemed
to
have
no
fancy
for
listening
to
any
explanation
of
our
points
of
difference
the
impression
among
the
winnebagoes
that
if
the
great
spirit
had
wished
them
different
from
what
they
are
he
would
have
made
them
so
seems
too
strong
to
yield
to
either
argument
or
persuasion
sometimes
those
who
are
desirous
of
appearing
somewhat
civilized
will
listen
quietly
to
all
that
is
advanced
on
the
subject
of
christianity
then
coolly
saying
yes
we
believe
that
too
will
change
the
conversation
to
other
subjects
as
a
general
thing
they
do
not
appear
to
perceive
that
there
is
anything
to
be
gained
by
adopting
the
religion
and
the
customs
of
the
whites
look
at
them
they
say
always
toiling
and
striving
always
wearing
a
brow
of
care
shut
up
in
houses
afraid
of
the
wind
and
the
rain
suffering
when
they
are
deprived
of
the
comforts
of
life
we
on
the
contrary
live
a
life
of
freedom
and
happiness
we
hunt
and
fish
and
pass
our
time
pleasantly
in
the
open
woods
and
prairies
if
we
are
hungry
we
take
some
game
or
if
we
do
not
find
that
we
can
go
without
if
our
enemies
trouble
us
we
can
kill
them
and
there
is
no
more
said
about
it
what
should
we
gain
by
changing
ourselves
into
white
men
christian
missionaries
with
all
their
efforts
to
convert
them
had
at
this
day
made
little
progress
in
enlightening
their
minds
upon
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
mazzuchelli
a
roman
catholic
priest
accompanied
by
miss
elizabeth
grignon
as
interpreter
made
a
missionary
visit
to
the
portage
during
our
residence
there
and
after
some
instruction
from
him
about
forty
consented
to
be
baptized
christian
names
were
given
to
them
with
which
they
seemed
much
pleased
and
not
less
so
with
the
little
plated
crucifixes
which
each
received
and
which
the
women
wore
about
their
necks
these
they
seemed
to
regard
with
a
devotional
feeling
but
i
was
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
their
language
to
gather
from
them
whether
they
understood
the
doctrine
the
symbol
was
designed
to
convey
certain
it
is
they
expressed
no
wish
to
learn
our
language
in
order
that
they
might
gain
a
fuller
knowledge
of
the
saviour
nor
any
solicitude
to
be
taught
more
about
him
than
they
had
received
during
the
missionary
short
visit
one
woman
to
whom
the
name
of
charlotte
had
been
given
signified
a
desire
to
learn
the
domestic
ways
of
the
whites
and
asked
of
me
as
a
favor
through
madame
paquette
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
come
on
and
learn
of
my
servants
our
way
of
managing
the
business
a
tub
was
given
her
and
my
woman
instructed
her
by
signs
and
example
how
she
was
to
manage
as
i
was
not
a
little
curious
to
observe
how
things
went
on
i
proceeded
after
a
time
to
the
kitchen
where
they
all
were
charlotte
was
at
her
tub
scouring
and
rubbing
with
all
her
might
at
her
little
crucifix
two
other
squaws
sat
upon
the
floor
near
her
watching
the
operation
that
is
the
work
she
has
been
at
for
the
last
said
josette
in
a
tone
of
great
impatience
never
learn
to
charlotte
however
soon
fell
diligently
to
work
and
really
seemed
as
if
she
would
tear
her
arms
off
with
her
violent
exertions
after
a
time
supposing
that
she
must
feel
a
good
deal
fatigued
and
exhausted
with
the
unaccustomed
labor
i
did
what
it
was
at
that
day
very
much
the
fashion
to
do
what
at
home
i
had
always
seen
done
on
what
in
short
i
imagine
was
then
a
general
custom
among
housekeepers
i
went
to
the
closet
intending
to
give
charlotte
a
glass
of
wine
or
brandy
and
water
my
cupboard
proved
to
be
in
the
state
of
the
luckless
mother
hubbard
nothing
of
the
kind
could
i
find
but
a
bottle
of
orange
shrub
of
this
i
poured
out
a
wineglassful
and
carrying
it
out
offered
it
to
the
woman
she
took
it
with
an
expression
of
great
pleasure
but
in
carrying
it
to
her
lips
she
stopped
short
and
exclaiming
whiskey
immediately
returned
it
to
me
i
would
still
have
pressed
it
upon
her
for
in
my
inexperience
i
really
believed
it
was
a
cordial
she
needed
but
pointing
to
her
crucifix
she
shook
her
head
and
returned
to
her
work
i
received
this
as
a
lesson
more
powerful
than
twenty
sermons
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
ever
seen
spirituous
liquors
rejected
upon
a
religious
principle
and
it
made
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
never
forgot
chapter
xxvii
the
among
the
women
of
the
tribe
with
whom
we
early
became
acquainted
our
greatest
favorite
was
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
this
family
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
boasted
in
some
remote
generation
a
cross
of
the
french
blood
and
this
fact
might
account
for
the
fair
complexion
and
soft
curling
hair
which
distinguished
our
friend
she
had
a
noble
forehead
full
expressive
eyes
and
fine
teeth
unlike
the
women
of
her
people
she
had
not
grown
brown
and
haggard
with
advancing
years
indeed
with
the
exception
of
one
feature
she
might
be
called
beautiful
she
had
many
years
before
married
a
or
fox
indian
and
according
to
the
custom
among
all
the
tribes
the
husband
came
home
to
the
wife
family
and
lived
among
the
winnebagoes
it
is
this
custom
so
exactly
the
reverse
of
civilized
ways
that
makes
the
birth
of
a
daughter
a
subject
of
peculiar
rejoicing
in
an
indian
family
she
will
bring
another
hunter
to
our
lodge
is
the
style
of
mutual
congratulation
the
continued
for
some
few
years
to
live
among
his
relations
but
as
no
children
blessed
their
union
he
at
length
became
tired
of
his
new
friends
and
longed
to
return
to
his
own
people
he
tried
for
a
time
to
persuade
his
wife
to
leave
her
home
and
accompany
him
to
the
mississippi
on
the
banks
of
which
the
sauks
and
foxes
lived
but
in
vain
she
could
not
resolve
to
make
the
sacrifice
one
day
after
many
fruitless
efforts
to
persuade
her
he
flew
into
a
violent
passion
then
if
you
will
not
go
with
me
said
he
i
will
leave
you
but
you
shall
never
be
the
wife
of
any
other
man
i
will
mark
you
saying
this
he
flew
upon
her
and
bit
off
the
end
of
her
nose
this
the
usual
punishment
for
conjugal
infidelity
is
the
greatest
disgrace
a
woman
can
receive
it
bars
her
forever
from
again
entering
the
pale
of
matrimony
the
wretch
fled
to
his
own
people
but
his
revenge
fell
short
of
its
aim
was
too
well
known
and
too
universally
respected
to
suffer
opprobrium
in
any
member
of
his
family
this
bright
loving
creature
in
particular
won
all
hearts
upon
a
first
acquaintance
she
certainly
did
ours
from
the
outset
she
suffered
much
from
rheumatism
and
a
remedy
we
gave
her
soon
afforded
her
almost
entire
relief
her
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
notwithstanding
that
from
long
suffering
she
had
become
partially
crippled
she
would
walk
all
the
way
from
the
barribault
a
distance
of
ten
miles
as
often
as
once
in
two
or
three
weeks
to
visit
us
then
to
sit
and
gaze
at
us
to
laugh
with
childish
glee
at
everything
new
or
strange
that
we
employed
ourselves
about
to
pat
and
stroke
us
every
time
we
came
near
her
sometimes
to
raise
our
hand
or
arm
and
kiss
it
these
were
her
demonstrations
of
affection
and
we
loved
her
in
return
it
was
always
a
joyful
announcement
when
looking
out
over
the
portage
road
somebody
called
out
the
is
coming
in
time
however
we
learned
to
call
her
by
her
baptismal
name
of
elizabeth
for
she
too
was
one
of
mazzuchelli
converts
she
came
one
day
accompanied
by
a
boy
carrying
a
young
fawn
she
had
brought
me
as
a
present
i
was
delighted
with
the
pretty
creature
with
its
soft
eyes
and
dappled
coat
but
having
often
heard
the
simile
as
wild
as
a
fawn
i
did
not
anticipate
much
success
in
taming
it
to
my
great
surprise
it
soon
learned
to
follow
me
like
a
dog
wherever
i
went
there
fan
was
sure
to
be
at
breakfast
she
would
lie
down
at
my
feet
under
the
table
one
of
her
first
tokens
of
affection
was
to
gnaw
off
all
the
trimming
from
my
black
silk
apron
as
she
lay
pretending
to
caress
and
fondle
me
nor
was
this
her
only
style
of
mischief
one
day
we
heard
a
great
rattling
among
the
crockery
in
the
kitchen
we
ran
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
found
that
miss
fan
had
made
her
way
to
a
shelf
of
the
dresser
about
two
feet
from
the
ground
and
was
endeavoring
to
find
a
comfortable
place
to
lie
down
among
the
plates
and
dishes
i
soon
observed
that
it
was
the
shelter
of
the
shelf
above
her
head
that
was
the
great
attraction
and
that
she
was
in
the
habit
of
seeking
out
a
place
of
repose
under
a
chair
or
something
approaching
to
an
umbrageous
bower
so
after
this
i
took
care
as
the
hour
for
her
morning
nap
approached
to
open
a
large
green
parasol
and
set
it
on
the
matting
in
the
corner
then
when
i
called
fan
fan
she
would
come
and
nestle
under
it
and
soon
fall
fast
asleep
one
morning
fan
was
missing
in
vain
we
called
and
sought
her
in
the
garden
in
the
enclosure
for
the
cattle
at
the
houses
of
the
frenchmen
along
the
hill
towards
paquette
no
fan
was
to
be
found
we
thought
she
had
asserted
her
own
wild
nature
and
sped
away
to
the
woods
it
was
a
hot
forenoon
and
the
doors
were
all
open
about
in
rushed
fan
panting
violently
and
threw
herself
upon
her
side
where
she
lay
with
her
feet
outstretched
her
mouth
foaming
and
exhibiting
all
the
signs
of
mortal
agony
we
tried
to
give
her
water
to
soothe
her
if
perhaps
it
might
be
fright
that
so
affected
her
but
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
gasp
and
a
spasm
she
breathed
her
last
whether
she
had
been
chased
by
the
greyhounds
or
whether
she
had
eaten
some
poisonous
weed
which
occasioning
her
suffering
had
driven
her
to
her
best
friends
for
aid
we
never
knew
but
we
lost
our
pretty
pet
and
many
were
the
tears
shed
for
her
very
shortly
after
the
departure
of
my
husband
we
received
a
visit
from
the
white
crow
the
little
priest
and
several
others
of
the
principal
chiefs
of
the
bock
river
indians
they
seemed
greatly
disappointed
at
learning
that
their
father
was
from
home
even
though
his
errand
was
to
get
the
silver
we
sent
for
paquette
who
interpreted
for
us
the
object
of
their
visit
they
had
come
to
inform
us
that
the
sauk
chief
black
hawk
and
his
band
who
in
compliance
with
a
former
treaty
had
removed
some
time
previous
to
the
west
of
the
mississippi
had
now
returned
to
their
old
homes
and
and
expressed
a
determination
not
to
relinquish
them
but
to
drive
off
the
white
settlers
who
had
begun
to
occupy
them
the
latter
in
fact
the
chief
had
already
done
and
having
as
it
was
said
induced
some
of
the
pottowattamies
to
join
him
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
he
might
persuade
some
of
the
winnebagoes
to
follow
their
example
these
chiefs
had
come
to
counsel
with
their
father
and
to
assure
him
that
they
should
do
all
in
their
power
to
keep
their
young
men
quiet
they
had
heard
that
troops
were
being
raised
down
among
the
whites
in
illinois
and
they
had
hopes
that
their
people
would
be
wise
enough
to
keep
out
of
difficulty
furthermore
they
begged
that
their
father
on
his
return
would
see
that
the
soldiers
did
not
meddle
with
them
so
long
as
they
remained
quiet
and
behaved
in
a
friendly
manner
white
crow
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
impress
it
upon
me
that
if
any
danger
should
arise
in
absence
he
should
come
with
his
people
to
protect
me
and
my
family
i
relied
upon
his
assurances
for
he
had
ever
shown
himself
an
upright
and
honorable
indian
notwithstanding
this
the
thoughts
of
indian
troubles
so
near
us
in
the
absence
of
our
guardian
and
protector
occasioned
us
many
an
anxious
moment
and
it
was
not
until
we
learned
of
the
peaceable
retreat
of
the
sauks
and
foxes
west
of
the
mississippi
that
we
were
able
wholly
to
lay
aside
our
fears
we
were
now
called
to
part
with
our
friends
major
twiggs
and
his
family
which
we
did
with
heartfelt
regret
he
gave
me
a
few
parting
words
about
our
old
acquaintance
krissman
when
i
went
into
the
barracks
the
other
day
said
he
about
the
time
the
men
were
taking
their
dinner
i
noticed
a
great
soldier
standing
against
the
crying
and
blubbering
said
i
on
earth
does
this
mean
that
fellow
there
said
krissman
for
it
was
he
scrowged
me
out
of
my
place
a
pretty
soldier
your
protége
will
make
madam
added
the
major
i
never
heard
more
of
my
hero
whether
he
went
to
exhibit
his
prowess
against
the
seminoles
and
mexicans
or
whether
he
returned
to
till
the
fertile
soil
of
his
native
german
flats
and
blow
his
favorite
horn
must
be
left
for
some
future
historian
to
tell
there
is
one
more
character
to
be
disposed
of
louisa
an
opportunity
offering
in
the
spring
the
major
placed
her
under
the
charge
of
a
person
going
to
buffalo
that
she
might
be
returned
to
her
parents
in
compliment
to
the
new
acquaintances
she
had
formed
she
shortened
her
skirts
mounted
a
pair
of
scarlet
leggings
embroidered
with
and
took
her
leave
of
military
life
having
deposited
with
the
gentleman
who
took
charge
of
her
sixty
dollars
for
safe
keeping
which
she
remarked
she
had
out
of
her
wages
at
a
dollar
a
week
through
the
winter
a
very
short
time
after
we
were
settled
in
our
new
home
at
the
agency
we
attempted
the
commencement
of
a
little
edwin
harry
and
josette
were
our
most
reliable
scholars
but
besides
them
there
were
the
two
little
manaigres
thérèse
paquette
and
her
florence
courville
a
pretty
young
girl
of
fifteen
none
of
these
girls
had
even
learned
their
letters
they
spoke
only
french
or
rather
the
canadian
and
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
give
them
at
once
the
sound
of
the
words
and
their
signification
which
they
were
careful
to
inquire
besides
this
there
was
the
task
of
correcting
the
false
ideas
and
remedying
the
ignorance
and
superstition
which
presented
so
formidable
an
obstacle
to
rational
improvement
we
did
our
best
however
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
after
a
time
making
really
respectable
progress
with
their
and
what
was
still
more
encouraging
acquiring
a
degree
of
light
and
knowledge
in
regard
to
better
things
in
process
of
time
however
florence
was
often
absent
from
her
class
her
sister
she
said
could
not
always
spare
her
she
wanted
her
to
keep
house
while
she
herself
went
over
oil
sunday
to
visit
her
friends
the
roys
who
lived
on
the
wisconsin
we
reasoned
with
madame
paquette
on
the
subject
could
she
not
spare
florence
on
some
hour
of
the
day
we
would
gladly
teach
her
on
a
for
she
seemed
anxious
to
learn
but
we
had
always
been
told
that
for
that
there
was
no
time
well
she
would
see
madame
alum
helm
and
madame
john
were
so
kind
there
was
no
improvement
however
in
regularity
after
a
time
manaigre
was
induced
to
send
his
children
to
cadle
at
green
bay
thérèse
accompanied
them
and
very
soon
florence
discontinued
her
attendance
altogether
we
were
obliged
from
that
time
forward
to
confine
our
instructions
to
our
own
domestic
circle
chapter
xxviii
indian
customs
and
dances
before
we
had
any
right
to
look
for
my
husband
return
i
one
day
received
a
message
inviting
me
to
come
up
to
the
new
house
we
all
went
in
a
body
for
we
had
purposely
stayed
away
a
few
days
expecting
this
summons
of
which
we
anticipated
the
meaning
plante
in
full
glee
was
seated
astride
of
a
small
keg
on
the
roof
close
beside
the
kitchen
chimney
on
the
very
summit
of
which
he
had
planted
a
green
bough
to
this
he
held
fast
with
one
hand
while
he
exultingly
waved
the
other
and
called
out
ban
madame
john
à
cette
heure
pour
le
régal
yes
plante
you
are
entitled
to
a
treat
and
i
hope
you
will
not
enjoy
it
the
less
that
pillon
and
manaigre
are
to
share
it
with
you
a
suitable
gratification
made
them
quite
contented
with
their
against
whom
plante
had
sometimes
been
inclined
to
grumble
because
as
he
said
she
had
him
called
up
too
early
in
the
morning
he
might
have
added
because
too
she
could
not
understand
the
philosophy
of
his
coming
in
to
work
in
his
own
garden
under
the
plea
that
it
was
too
rainy
to
work
in
monsieur
john
it
was
with
no
ordinary
feelings
of
satisfaction
that
we
quitted
the
old
log
tenement
and
took
possession
of
our
new
dwelling
small
and
insignificant
though
it
was
i
was
only
too
happy
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
a
real
bedchamber
in
place
of
the
parlor
floor
which
i
had
occupied
as
such
for
more
than
two
months
it
is
true
that
our
culinary
arrangements
were
still
upon
no
greatly
improved
plan
the
clay
chimney
was
not
of
sufficient
strength
to
hold
the
trammel
and
which
at
that
day
had
not
been
superseded
by
the
and
our
fire
was
made
as
in
the
olden
time
with
vast
logs
behind
and
smaller
sticks
in
front
laid
across
upon
the
andirons
or
upon
these
sticks
were
placed
such
of
the
as
could
not
be
accommodated
on
the
hearth
but
woe
to
the
dinner
or
the
supper
if
through
a
little
want
of
care
or
scrutiny
one
treacherous
piece
was
suffered
to
burn
away
down
would
come
the
whole
arrangement
kettles
saucepans
burning
brands
and
cinders
in
one
almost
inextricable
mass
how
often
this
happened
under
the
supervision
of
harry
or
little
josette
while
the
mistress
was
playing
lady
to
some
visitor
in
the
parlor
vain
to
tell
then
spite
of
monsieur
plante
palisades
round
the
chimney
in
a
hard
shower
the
rain
would
come
pelting
down
and
the
hearth
unfortunately
sloping
a
little
the
wrong
way
the
fire
would
become
extinguished
while
the
bark
on
the
roof
failing
to
do
its
duty
we
were
now
and
then
so
completely
deluged
that
there
was
no
resource
but
to
catch
up
the
breakfast
or
dinner
and
tuck
it
under
the
table
until
better
times
that
is
till
fair
weather
came
again
in
spite
of
all
these
little
adverse
occurrences
however
we
enjoyed
our
new
quarters
exceedingly
our
garden
was
well
furnished
with
vegetables
and
even
the
which
we
had
brought
from
chicago
with
us
tied
in
a
bundle
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
had
produced
us
some
fruit
the
indian
women
were
very
constant
in
their
visits
and
their
presents
sometimes
it
was
venison
sometimes
ducks
or
pigeons
whortleberries
wild
plums
or
cranberries
according
to
the
season
neat
pretty
mats
for
the
floor
or
the
table
wooden
bowls
or
ladles
fancy
work
of
or
these
they
would
bring
in
and
throw
at
my
feet
if
through
inattention
i
failed
to
appear
pleased
to
raise
the
articles
from
the
floor
and
lay
them
carefully
aside
a
look
of
mortification
and
the
observation
our
mother
hates
our
gifts
showed
how
much
their
feelings
were
wounded
it
was
always
expected
that
a
present
would
be
received
graciously
and
returned
with
something
twice
its
value
meantime
week
after
week
wore
on
and
still
was
the
return
of
the
master
delayed
the
rare
arrival
of
a
schooner
at
green
bay
in
which
to
take
passage
for
detroit
made
it
always
a
matter
of
uncertainty
what
length
of
time
would
be
necessary
for
a
journey
across
the
lakes
and
back
so
that
it
was
not
until
the
last
of
august
that
he
again
reached
his
home
great
was
his
surprise
to
find
us
so
nicely
moved
and
settled
and
under
his
active
supervision
the
evils
of
which
we
had
had
to
complain
were
soon
remedied
my
husband
had
met
at
fort
gratiot
and
brought
with
him
my
young
brother
julian
whom
my
parents
were
sending
at
our
request
to
reside
with
us
edwin
was
overjoyed
to
have
a
companion
once
more
for
he
had
hitherto
been
very
solitary
the
boys
soon
had
enough
to
occupy
their
attention
as
in
obedience
to
a
summons
sent
to
the
different
villages
the
indians
very
shortly
came
flocking
in
to
the
payment
there
was
among
their
number
this
year
one
whom
i
had
never
before
seen
the
mother
of
the
elder
no
one
could
tell
her
age
but
all
agreed
that
she
must
have
seen
upwards
of
a
hundred
winters
her
eyes
dimmed
and
almost
white
with
age
her
face
dark
and
withered
like
a
baked
apple
her
voice
tremulous
and
feeble
except
when
raised
in
fury
to
reprove
her
graceless
grandsons
who
were
fond
of
playing
her
all
sorts
of
mischievous
tricks
indicated
the
very
great
age
she
must
have
attained
she
usually
went
upon
not
having
strength
to
hold
herself
erect
on
the
day
of
the
payment
having
received
her
portion
which
she
carefully
hid
in
the
corner
of
her
blanket
she
came
crawling
along
and
seated
herself
on
the
to
count
her
treasure
my
sister
and
i
were
watching
her
movements
from
the
open
window
presently
just
as
she
had
unobserved
as
she
thought
spread
out
her
silver
before
her
two
of
her
descendants
came
suddenly
upon
her
at
first
they
seemed
begging
for
a
share
but
she
repulsed
them
with
angry
gestures
when
one
of
them
made
a
sudden
swoop
and
possessed
himself
of
a
handful
she
tried
to
rise
to
pursue
him
but
was
unable
to
do
more
than
clutch
the
remainder
and
utter
the
most
unearthly
screams
of
rage
at
this
instant
the
boys
raised
their
eyes
and
perceived
us
regarding
them
they
burst
into
a
laugh
and
with
a
sort
of
mocking
gesture
they
threw
her
the
and
ran
back
to
the
in
spite
of
their
vexatious
tricks
she
seemed
very
fond
of
them
and
never
failed
to
beg
something
of
her
father
that
she
might
bestow
upon
them
she
crept
into
the
parlor
one
morning
then
straightening
herself
up
and
supporting
herself
by
the
frame
of
the
door
she
cried
in
a
most
piteous
tone
i
have
no
my
husband
smiling
and
taking
up
the
same
little
tone
cried
in
return
do
you
wish
to
look
at
yourself
mother
the
idea
seemed
to
her
so
irresistibly
comic
that
she
laughed
until
she
was
fairly
obliged
to
seat
herself
upon
the
floor
and
give
way
to
her
enjoyment
she
then
owned
that
it
was
for
one
of
the
boys
that
she
wanted
the
little
mirror
when
her
father
had
given
it
to
her
she
found
that
she
had
no
comb
then
that
she
had
no
knife
then
that
she
had
no
calico
shawl
until
it
ended
as
it
generally
did
by
paying
pretty
dearly
for
his
joke
when
the
indians
arrived
and
when
they
departed
my
sense
of
rights
was
often
greatly
outraged
the
master
of
the
family
as
a
general
thing
came
leisurely
bearing
his
gun
and
perhaps
a
lance
in
his
hand
the
woman
with
the
mats
and
poles
of
her
lodge
upon
her
shoulders
her
pappoose
if
she
had
one
her
kettles
sacks
of
corn
and
wild
rice
and
not
unfrequently
the
household
dog
perched
on
the
top
of
all
if
there
is
a
horse
or
pony
in
the
list
of
family
possessions
the
man
rides
the
squaw
trudges
after
this
unequal
division
of
labor
is
the
result
of
no
want
of
kind
affectionate
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
husband
it
is
rather
the
instinct
of
the
sex
to
assert
their
superiority
of
position
and
importance
when
a
proper
occasion
offers
when
out
of
the
reach
of
observation
and
in
no
danger
of
compromising
his
own
dignity
the
husband
is
willing
enough
to
relieve
his
spouse
from
the
burden
that
custom
imposes
on
her
by
sharing
her
labors
and
hardships
the
payment
had
not
passed
without
its
appropriate
number
of
complimentary
and
medicine
dances
the
latter
take
place
only
at
rare
intervals
the
former
whenever
an
occasion
demanding
a
manifestation
of
respect
and
courtesy
presents
itself
it
is
the
custom
to
ask
permission
of
the
person
to
be
complimented
to
dance
for
him
this
granted
preparation
is
made
by
painting
the
face
elaborately
and
marking
the
person
which
is
usually
bare
about
the
chest
and
shoulders
after
the
most
approved
pattern
all
the
ornaments
that
can
be
mustered
are
added
to
the
hair
or
headdress
happy
is
he
who
in
virtue
of
having
taken
one
or
more
scalps
is
entitled
to
proclaim
it
by
a
corresponding
number
of
eagle
feathers
the
less
fortunate
make
a
substitute
of
the
feathers
of
the
wild
turkey
or
better
still
of
the
first
unlucky
rooster
that
falls
in
their
way
my
poor
fowls
during
the
time
of
payment
were
always
thoroughly
plucked
when
their
preparations
are
completed
the
dancers
assemble
at
some
convenient
place
whence
they
come
marching
to
the
spot
appointed
accompanied
by
the
music
of
the
indian
drum
and
or
rattle
they
range
themselves
in
a
circle
and
dance
with
violent
contortions
and
gesticulations
some
of
them
graceful
others
only
energetic
the
squaws
who
stand
a
little
apart
and
mingle
their
discordant
voices
with
the
music
of
the
instruments
rarely
participating
in
the
dance
occasionally
however
when
excited
by
the
general
gaiety
a
few
of
them
will
form
a
circle
outside
and
perform
a
sort
of
ungraceful
movement
which
has
no
merit
save
the
perfect
time
which
is
kept
and
for
which
the
indians
seem
without
exception
to
possess
a
natural
ear
the
dance
finished
which
is
only
when
the
strength
of
the
dancers
is
quite
exhausted
a
quantity
of
presents
are
brought
and
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
by
order
of
the
party
complimented
an
equitable
distribution
is
made
by
one
of
their
number
and
the
object
of
all
this
display
having
been
accomplished
they
retire
the
medicine
dance
is
carried
on
chiefly
to
celebrate
the
skill
of
the
in
curing
diseases
this
functionary
belongs
to
a
fraternity
who
are
supposed
to
add
to
their
other
powers
some
skill
in
interpreting
the
will
of
the
great
spirit
in
regard
to
the
conduct
of
his
people
he
occasionally
makes
offerings
and
sacrifices
which
are
regarded
as
propitiatory
in
this
sense
the
term
priest
may
be
deemed
applicable
to
him
he
is
also
a
prophet
in
so
far
as
he
is
in
a
limited
degree
an
instructor
but
he
does
not
claim
to
possess
the
gift
of
foretelling
future
events
a
person
is
selected
to
join
the
fraternity
of
the
by
those
already
initiated
chiefly
on
account
of
some
skill
or
sagacity
that
has
been
observed
in
him
sometimes
it
happens
that
a
person
who
has
had
a
severe
illness
which
has
yielded
to
the
prescriptions
of
one
of
the
members
is
considered
a
proper
object
of
choice
from
a
sort
of
claim
thus
established
when
he
is
about
to
be
initiated
a
great
feast
is
made
of
course
at
the
expense
of
the
candidate
for
in
simple
as
in
civilized
life
the
same
principle
of
politics
holds
good
honors
must
be
paid
for
an
animal
is
killed
and
dressed
of
which
the
people
at
large
partake
there
are
dances
and
songs
and
speeches
in
abundance
then
the
chief
takes
the
candidate
and
privately
instructs
him
in
all
the
ceremonies
and
knowledge
necessary
to
make
him
an
accomplished
member
of
the
fraternity
sometimes
the
new
member
selected
is
still
a
child
in
that
case
he
is
taken
by
the
so
soon
as
he
reaches
a
proper
age
and
qualified
by
instruction
and
example
to
become
a
creditable
member
of
the
fraternity
among
the
winnebagoes
there
seems
a
considerable
belief
in
magic
each
has
a
bag
or
sack
in
which
is
supposed
to
be
inclosed
some
animal
to
whom
in
the
course
of
their
he
addresses
himself
crying
to
him
in
the
note
common
to
his
imagined
species
and
the
people
seem
to
be
persuaded
that
the
answers
which
are
announced
are
really
communications
in
this
form
from
the
great
spirit
the
indians
appear
to
have
no
idea
of
a
retribution
beyond
this
life
they
have
a
strong
appreciation
of
the
great
fundamental
virtues
of
natural
religion
the
worship
of
the
great
spirit
brotherly
love
parental
affection
honesty
temperance
and
chastity
any
infringement
of
the
laws
of
the
great
spirit
by
a
departure
from
these
virtues
they
believe
will
excite
his
anger
and
draw
down
punishment
these
are
their
principles
that
their
practice
evinces
more
and
more
a
departure
from
them
under
the
debasing
influences
of
a
proximity
to
the
whites
is
a
melancholy
truth
which
no
one
will
admit
with
so
much
sorrow
as
those
who
lived
among
them
and
esteemed
them
before
this
signal
change
had
taken
place
one
of
the
first
improvements
that
suggested
itself
about
our
new
dwelling
was
the
removal
of
some
very
unsightly
pickets
surrounding
two
or
three
indian
graves
on
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
house
such
however
is
the
reverence
in
which
these
are
held
that
we
felt
we
must
approach
the
subject
with
great
delicacy
and
consideration
my
husband
at
length
ventured
to
propose
to
pawnee
blanc
the
nearest
surviving
relative
of
the
person
interred
to
replace
the
pickets
with
a
neat
wooden
platform
the
idea
pleased
her
much
for
through
her
intimacy
in
family
she
had
acquired
something
of
a
taste
for
civilization
accordingly
a
little
platform
about
a
foot
in
height
properly
finished
with
a
moulding
around
the
edge
was
substituted
for
the
worn
and
blackened
pickets
and
it
was
touching
to
witness
the
mournful
satisfaction
with
which
two
or
three
old
crones
would
come
regularly
every
evening
at
sunset
to
sit
and
gossip
over
the
ashes
of
their
departed
relatives
on
the
fine
moonlight
nights
too
there
might
often
be
seen
a
group
sitting
there
and
enjoying
what
is
to
them
a
solemn
hour
for
they
entertain
the
poetic
belief
that
the
moon
was
made
to
give
light
to
the
dead
the
reverence
of
the
indians
for
the
memory
of
their
departed
friends
and
their
dutiful
attention
in
visiting
and
making
offerings
to
the
great
spirit
over
their
last
is
an
example
worthy
of
imitation
among
their
more
enlightened
brethren
not
so
however
with
some
of
their
customs
in
relation
to
the
dead
the
news
of
the
decease
of
one
of
their
number
is
a
signal
for
a
general
mourning
and
lamentation
it
is
also
in
some
instances
i
am
sorry
to
say
when
the
means
and
appliances
can
be
found
the
apology
for
a
general
carouse
the
relatives
weep
and
howl
for
grief
the
friends
and
acquaintance
bear
them
company
through
sympathy
a
few
of
their
number
are
deputed
to
wait
upon
their
father
to
inform
him
of
the
event
and
to
beg
some
presents
to
help
them
as
they
express
it
dry
up
their
tears
we
received
such
a
visit
one
morning
not
long
after
the
payment
was
concluded
a
drunken
little
indian
named
by
the
french
people
around
old
boilvin
from
his
resemblance
to
an
indian
agent
of
that
name
at
prairie
du
chien
was
the
person
on
account
of
whose
death
the
application
was
made
he
had
been
fishing
they
said
on
the
shores
of
one
of
the
little
lakes
near
the
portage
and
having
taken
a
little
too
much
had
fallen
into
the
water
and
been
drowned
nothing
of
him
had
been
found
but
his
blanket
on
the
bank
so
there
could
be
no
funeral
ceremonies
but
his
friends
were
prepared
to
make
a
great
lamentation
about
him
their
father
presented
them
with
tobacco
knives
calico
and
in
proportion
to
what
he
thought
might
be
their
reasonable
grief
at
the
loss
of
such
a
worthless
vagabond
and
they
departed
there
was
no
difficulty
notwithstanding
the
stringent
prohibitions
on
the
subject
in
procuring
a
keg
of
whiskey
from
some
of
the
traders
who
yet
remained
armed
with
that
and
their
other
treasures
they
assembled
at
an
appointed
spot
not
far
from
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
and
sitting
down
with
the
keg
in
their
midst
they
commenced
their
affliction
the
more
they
drank
the
more
clamorous
became
their
grief
and
the
faster
flowed
their
tears
in
the
midst
of
these
demonstrations
a
little
figure
bent
and
staggering
covered
with
mud
and
all
in
disorder
with
a
countenance
full
of
wonder
and
sympathy
approached
them
and
began
why
what
what
who
dead
who
dead
repeated
they
looking
up
in
astonishment
why
dead
you
were
drowned
in
swan
lake
did
not
we
find
your
blanket
there
come
sit
down
and
help
us
mourn
the
old
man
did
not
wait
for
a
second
invitation
he
took
his
seat
and
cried
and
drank
with
the
rest
weeping
and
lamenting
as
bitterly
as
any
of
them
and
the
strange
scene
was
continued
as
long
as
they
had
power
to
articulate
or
any
portion
of
the
whiskey
was
left
chapter
xxix
story
of
the
red
fox
the
indians
of
whatever
tribe
are
exceedingly
fond
of
narrating
or
listening
to
tales
and
stories
whether
historical
or
fictitious
they
have
their
professed
storytellers
like
the
oriental
nations
and
these
go
about
from
village
to
village
collecting
an
admiring
and
attentive
audience
however
and
familiar
the
matter
they
recite
it
is
in
this
way
that
their
traditions
are
preserved
and
handed
down
unimpaired
from
generation
to
generation
their
knowledge
of
the
geography
of
their
country
is
wonderfully
exact
i
have
seen
an
indian
sit
in
his
lodge
and
draw
a
map
in
the
ashes
of
the
northwestern
states
not
of
their
statistical
but
their
geographical
features
lakes
rivers
and
mountains
with
the
greatest
accuracy
giving
their
relative
distances
by
days
journeys
without
hesitation
and
even
extending
his
drawings
and
explanations
as
far
as
kentucky
and
tennessee
of
biography
they
preserve
not
only
the
leading
events
in
the
life
of
the
person
but
his
features
appearance
and
bearing
his
manners
and
whatever
little
trait
or
peculiarity
characterized
him
the
women
are
more
fond
of
fiction
and
some
of
their
stories
have
a
strange
mingling
of
humor
and
pathos
i
give
the
two
which
follow
as
specimens
the
indian
names
contained
in
them
are
in
the
ottawa
or
language
but
the
same
tales
are
current
in
all
the
different
tongues
and
dialects
story
of
the
red
fox
this
is
an
animal
to
which
many
peculiarities
are
attributed
he
is
said
to
resemble
the
jackal
in
his
habit
of
molesting
the
graves
of
the
dead
and
the
indians
have
a
superstitious
dread
of
hearing
his
bark
at
night
believing
that
it
forebodes
calamity
and
death
they
say
too
that
he
was
originally
of
one
uniform
color
but
that
his
legs
became
black
in
the
manner
related
in
the
story
there
was
a
chief
of
a
certain
village
who
had
a
beautiful
daughter
he
resolved
upon
one
occasion
to
make
a
feast
and
invite
all
the
animals
when
the
invitation
was
brought
to
the
red
fox
he
inquired
what
are
you
going
to
have
for
supper
was
the
reply
this
is
a
porridge
made
of
parched
corn
slightly
cracked
the
fox
turned
up
his
little
sharp
nose
no
i
thank
you
said
he
i
can
get
plenty
of
that
at
home
the
messenger
returned
to
the
chief
and
reported
the
contemptuous
refusal
of
the
fox
go
back
to
him
said
the
chief
and
tell
him
we
are
going
to
have
a
nice
fresh
body
and
we
will
have
it
cooked
in
the
most
delicate
manner
possible
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
such
a
treat
the
fox
gave
a
very
hearty
assent
to
the
second
invitation
the
hour
arrived
and
he
set
off
for
the
lodge
of
the
chief
to
attend
the
feast
the
company
were
all
prepared
for
him
for
they
made
common
cause
with
their
friend
who
had
been
insulted
as
the
fox
entered
the
guest
next
the
door
with
great
courtesy
rose
from
his
place
and
begged
the
to
be
seated
immediately
the
person
next
him
also
rose
and
insisted
that
the
fox
should
occupy
his
place
as
it
was
still
nearer
the
fire
the
post
of
honor
then
the
third
with
many
expressions
of
civility
pressed
him
to
exchange
with
him
and
thus
with
many
ceremonious
flourishes
he
was
passed
along
the
circle
always
approaching
the
fire
where
a
huge
cauldron
stood
in
which
the
good
cheer
was
still
cooking
the
fox
was
by
no
means
unwilling
to
occupy
the
highest
place
in
the
assembly
and
besides
he
was
anxious
to
take
a
peep
into
the
kettle
for
he
had
his
suspicions
that
he
might
be
disappointed
of
the
delicacies
he
had
been
expecting
so
by
degrees
he
was
ushered
nearer
and
nearer
the
great
blazing
fire
until
by
a
dexterous
push
and
shove
he
was
hoisted
into
the
seething
kettle
his
feet
were
dreadfully
scalded
but
he
leaped
out
and
ran
home
to
his
lodge
howling
and
crying
with
pain
his
grandmother
with
whom
according
to
the
custom
of
animals
he
lived
demanded
of
him
an
account
of
the
affair
when
he
had
faithfully
related
all
the
circumstances
for
unlike
the
civilized
animals
he
did
not
think
of
telling
his
grandmother
a
story
she
reproved
him
very
strongly
you
have
committed
two
great
faults
said
she
in
the
first
place
you
were
very
rude
to
the
chief
who
was
so
kind
as
to
invite
you
and
by
returning
insult
for
civility
you
made
yourself
enemies
who
were
determined
to
punish
you
in
the
next
place
it
was
very
unbecoming
in
you
to
be
so
forward
to
take
the
place
of
honor
had
you
been
contented
modestly
to
keep
your
seat
near
the
door
you
would
have
escaped
the
misfortune
that
has
befallen
you
all
this
was
not
very
consolatory
to
the
poor
fox
who
continued
to
whine
and
cry
most
piteously
while
his
grandmother
having
finished
her
lecture
proceeded
to
bind
up
his
wounds
great
virtue
is
supposed
to
be
added
to
all
medical
prescriptions
and
applications
by
a
little
dancing
so
the
dressing
having
been
applied
the
grandmother
fell
to
dancing
with
all
her
might
round
and
round
in
the
lodge
when
she
was
nearly
exhausted
the
fox
said
grandmother
take
off
the
bandages
and
see
if
my
legs
are
healed
she
did
as
he
requested
but
no
the
burns
were
still
fresh
she
danced
and
danced
again
now
and
then
as
he
grew
impatient
she
would
remove
the
coverings
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
remedies
at
length
towards
morning
she
looked
and
to
be
sure
the
burns
were
quite
healed
but
oh
cried
she
your
legs
are
as
black
as
a
coal
they
were
so
badly
burned
that
they
will
never
return
to
their
color
the
poor
fox
who
like
many
another
brave
was
vain
of
his
legs
fell
into
a
transport
of
lamentation
oh
my
legs
my
pretty
red
legs
what
shall
i
do
the
young
girls
will
all
despise
me
i
shall
never
dare
to
show
myself
among
them
again
he
cried
and
sobbed
until
his
grandmother
fatigued
with
her
exercise
fell
asleep
by
this
time
he
had
decided
upon
his
plan
of
revenge
he
rose
and
stole
softly
out
of
his
lodge
and
pursuing
his
way
rapidly
towards
the
village
of
the
chief
he
turned
his
face
in
the
direction
of
the
principal
lodge
and
barked
when
the
inhabitants
heard
this
sound
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
their
hearts
trembled
they
knew
that
it
foreboded
sorrow
and
trouble
to
some
one
of
their
number
a
very
short
time
elapsed
before
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
chief
fell
sick
and
she
grew
rapidly
worse
and
worse
spite
of
medicines
charms
and
dances
at
length
she
died
the
fox
had
not
intended
to
bring
misfortune
on
the
village
in
this
shape
for
he
loved
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
chief
so
he
kept
in
his
lodge
and
mourned
and
fretted
for
her
death
preparations
were
made
for
a
magnificent
funeral
but
the
friends
of
the
deceased
were
in
great
perplexity
if
we
bury
her
in
the
earth
said
they
the
fox
will
come
and
disturb
her
remains
he
has
barked
her
to
death
and
he
will
be
glad
to
come
and
finish
his
work
of
revenge
they
took
counsel
together
and
determined
to
hang
her
body
high
in
a
tree
as
a
place
of
sepulture
they
thought
the
fox
would
go
groping
about
in
the
earth
and
not
lift
up
his
eyes
to
the
branches
above
his
head
but
the
grandmother
had
been
at
the
funeral
and
she
returned
and
told
the
fox
all
that
had
been
done
now
my
son
said
she
listen
to
me
do
not
meddle
with
the
remains
of
the
chief
daughter
you
have
done
mischief
enough
already
leave
her
in
peace
as
soon
as
the
grandmother
was
asleep
at
night
the
fox
rambled
forth
he
soon
found
the
place
he
sought
and
came
and
sat
under
the
tree
where
the
young
girl
had
been
placed
he
gazed
and
gazed
at
her
all
the
livelong
night
and
she
appeared
as
beautiful
as
when
in
life
but
when
the
day
dawned
and
the
light
enabled
him
to
see
more
clearly
then
he
observed
that
decay
was
doing
its
work
that
instead
of
a
beautiful
she
presented
only
a
loathsome
appearance
he
went
home
sad
and
afflicted
and
passed
all
the
day
mourning
in
his
lodge
have
you
disturbed
the
remains
of
the
chief
beautiful
daughter
was
his
parent
anxious
question
no
grandmother
and
he
uttered
not
another
word
thus
it
went
on
for
many
days
and
nights
the
fox
always
took
care
to
quit
his
watch
at
the
early
dawn
of
day
for
he
knew
that
her
friends
would
suspect
him
and
come
betimes
to
see
if
all
was
right
at
length
he
perceived
that
gradually
the
young
girl
looked
less
and
less
hideous
in
the
morning
light
and
that
she
by
degrees
resumed
the
appearance
she
had
presented
in
life
so
that
in
process
of
time
her
beauty
and
look
of
health
quite
returned
to
her
one
day
he
said
grandmother
give
me
my
pipe
that
i
may
take
a
smoke
ah
cried
she
you
begin
to
be
comforted
you
have
never
smoked
since
the
death
of
the
chief
beautiful
daughter
have
you
heard
some
good
news
never
you
mind
said
he
bring
the
pipe
he
sat
down
and
smoked
and
smoked
after
a
time
he
said
grandmother
sweep
your
lodge
and
put
it
all
in
order
for
this
day
you
will
receive
a
visit
from
your
the
grandmother
did
as
she
was
desired
she
swept
her
lodge
and
arranged
it
with
all
the
taste
she
possessed
and
then
both
sat
down
to
await
the
visit
when
you
hear
a
sound
at
the
door
said
the
fox
you
must
give
the
salutation
and
say
come
in
when
they
had
been
thus
seated
for
a
time
the
grandmother
heard
a
faint
rustling
sound
she
looked
towards
the
door
to
her
surprise
the
mat
which
usually
hung
as
a
curtain
was
rolled
up
and
the
door
was
open
cried
she
something
like
a
faint
faint
shadow
appeared
to
glide
in
it
took
gradually
a
more
distinct
outline
as
she
looked
and
looked
she
began
to
discern
the
form
and
features
of
the
chief
beautiful
daughter
but
it
was
long
before
she
appeared
like
a
reality
and
took
her
place
in
the
lodge
like
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
they
kept
the
matter
hid
very
close
for
they
would
not
for
the
world
that
the
father
or
friends
of
the
bride
should
know
what
had
happened
soon
however
it
began
to
be
rumored
about
that
the
chief
beautiful
daughter
had
returned
to
life
and
was
living
in
the
red
fox
lodge
how
it
ever
became
known
was
a
mystery
for
of
course
the
grandmother
never
spoke
of
it
be
that
as
it
may
the
news
created
great
excitement
in
the
village
this
must
never
be
said
they
all
he
barked
her
to
death
once
and
who
knows
what
he
may
do
next
time
the
father
took
at
once
a
decided
part
the
red
fox
is
not
worthy
of
my
daughter
he
said
i
had
promised
her
to
the
hart
the
finest
and
most
elegant
among
the
animals
now
that
she
has
returned
to
life
i
shall
keep
my
word
so
the
friends
all
went
in
a
body
to
the
lodge
of
the
red
fox
the
bridegroom
the
bride
and
the
grandmother
made
all
the
resistance
possible
but
they
were
overpowered
by
numbers
and
the
hart
having
remained
conveniently
waiting
on
the
outside
where
there
was
no
danger
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
chief
was
placed
upon
his
back
and
he
coursed
away
through
the
forest
to
carry
her
to
his
own
home
when
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
lodge
however
he
turned
his
head
but
no
bride
was
in
the
place
where
he
expected
to
see
her
he
had
thought
his
burden
very
light
from
the
beginning
but
that
he
supposed
was
natural
to
spirits
returned
from
the
dead
he
never
imagined
she
had
at
the
outset
glided
from
her
seat
and
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
slipped
back
unobserved
to
her
chosen
husband
one
or
two
attempts
were
made
by
the
friends
after
this
to
repossess
themselves
of
the
young
creature
but
all
without
success
then
they
said
let
her
remain
where
she
is
it
is
true
the
red
fox
occasioned
her
death
but
by
his
watchfulness
and
care
he
caressed
her
into
life
again
therefore
she
rightfully
belongs
to
him
so
the
red
fox
and
his
beautiful
bride
lived
long
together
in
great
peace
and
happiness
chapter
xxx
story
of
there
was
a
young
man
named
the
little
duck
paddling
his
canoe
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
two
girls
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
seeing
him
the
elder
said
to
the
younger
let
us
call
to
him
to
take
us
a
sail
it
must
be
remarked
that
in
all
indian
stories
where
two
or
more
sisters
are
the
the
elder
is
invariably
represented
as
silly
ridiculous
and
disgusting
the
younger
as
wise
and
beautiful
in
the
present
case
the
younger
remonstrated
oh
no
said
she
let
us
not
do
such
a
thing
what
will
he
think
of
us
but
the
other
persevered
and
called
to
him
ho
come
and
take
us
into
your
canoe
the
young
man
obeyed
and
approaching
the
shore
he
took
them
with
him
into
the
canoe
who
are
you
asked
the
elder
sister
i
am
replied
he
the
great
chief
this
was
something
of
a
fairy
for
when
surrounded
by
his
followers
and
wishing
to
confer
favors
on
them
he
had
a
habit
of
coughing
slightly
when
there
would
fly
forth
from
his
mouth
quantities
of
silver
brooches
and
other
ornaments
for
which
it
was
the
custom
of
his
people
to
scramble
each
striving
as
in
more
civilized
life
to
get
more
than
his
share
accordingly
the
elder
sister
said
if
you
are
let
us
see
you
cough
had
a
few
of
these
silver
ornaments
which
he
had
got
by
scrambling
and
which
he
kept
stowed
away
in
the
sides
of
his
mouth
in
case
of
emergency
so
he
gave
some
spasmodic
coughs
and
brought
forth
a
few
which
the
girl
eagerly
seized
after
a
time
as
they
paddled
along
a
fine
noble
elk
came
forth
from
the
forest
and
approached
the
water
to
drink
what
is
that
asked
the
spokeswoman
for
the
younger
sister
sat
silent
and
modest
all
the
time
it
is
my
dog
that
i
hunt
with
call
him
to
us
that
i
may
see
him
called
but
the
elk
turned
and
fled
into
the
woods
he
does
not
seem
to
obey
you
however
no
it
is
because
you
inspire
him
with
disgust
and
therefore
he
flies
from
you
soon
a
bear
made
his
appearance
by
the
water
edge
what
is
that
one
of
my
servants
again
he
was
requested
to
call
him
and
as
the
call
was
disregarded
the
same
reason
as
before
was
assigned
their
excursion
was
at
length
ended
there
had
been
a
little
magic
in
it
for
although
the
young
girls
had
supposed
themselves
to
be
in
a
canoe
there
was
in
reality
no
canoe
at
all
they
only
imagined
it
to
have
been
so
now
lived
with
his
grandmother
and
to
her
lodge
he
conducted
his
young
friends
they
stood
outside
while
he
went
in
grandmother
said
he
i
have
brought
you
two
young
girls
who
will
be
your
invite
them
into
your
lodge
upon
this
the
old
woman
called
ho
come
in
and
they
entered
they
were
made
welcome
and
treated
to
the
best
of
everything
in
the
mean
time
the
real
the
great
chief
made
preparations
for
a
grand
feast
when
he
was
sending
his
messenger
out
with
the
invitations
he
said
to
him
be
very
particular
to
bid
to
the
feast
for
as
he
is
the
smallest
and
meanest
person
in
the
tribe
you
must
use
double
ceremony
with
him
or
he
will
be
apt
to
think
himself
slighted
was
sitting
in
his
lodge
with
his
new
friends
when
the
messenger
arrived
ho
cried
he
you
are
invited
to
a
great
feast
that
is
to
give
to
all
his
subjects
but
took
no
notice
of
the
invitation
he
only
whistled
and
pretended
not
to
hear
the
messenger
repeated
his
words
then
finding
that
no
attention
was
paid
to
them
he
went
his
way
the
young
girls
looked
at
each
other
during
the
scene
greatly
astonished
at
length
the
elder
spoke
what
does
this
mean
said
she
why
does
he
call
you
and
invite
you
to
visit
oh
said
it
is
one
of
my
followers
that
always
likes
to
be
a
little
impudent
i
am
obliged
to
put
up
with
it
sometimes
but
you
observed
that
i
treated
him
with
silent
contempt
the
messenger
returned
to
the
chief
and
reported
the
manner
in
which
the
invitation
had
been
received
oh
said
the
chief
it
is
because
he
feels
that
he
is
poor
and
insignificant
go
back
again
call
him
by
my
name
and
make
a
flourishing
speech
to
him
the
messenger
fulfilled
his
mission
as
he
was
bid
said
he
pompously
a
great
feast
is
to
be
given
and
i
am
sent
most
respectfully
to
solicit
the
honor
of
your
company
did
i
not
tell
you
said
to
the
maidens
then
nodding
with
careless
condescension
he
added
tell
them
i
come
at
night
dressed
himself
in
his
very
best
paint
feathers
and
ornaments
but
before
his
departure
he
took
his
grandmother
aside
be
sure
said
he
that
you
watch
these
young
people
closely
until
i
come
back
shut
up
your
lodge
tight
let
no
one
come
in
or
go
out
and
above
all
things
do
not
go
to
sleep
these
orders
given
he
went
his
way
the
grandmother
tried
her
best
to
keep
awake
but
finding
herself
growing
more
and
more
sleepy
as
the
night
wore
on
she
took
a
strong
cord
and
laced
across
the
mat
which
hung
before
the
entrance
to
the
lodge
as
the
indians
lace
up
the
mouths
of
their
bags
then
having
seen
all
things
secure
and
the
girls
quiet
in
bed
she
lay
down
and
soon
fell
into
a
comfortable
sleep
the
young
girls
in
the
mean
while
were
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
what
had
become
of
and
as
soon
as
they
were
sure
the
old
lady
was
asleep
they
prepared
to
follow
him
and
see
what
was
going
on
fearing
however
that
the
grandmother
might
awake
and
discover
their
absence
they
took
two
logs
of
wood
and
putting
them
under
the
blanket
so
disposed
them
as
to
present
the
appearance
of
persons
sleeping
quietly
they
then
cut
the
cords
that
fastened
the
door
and
guided
by
the
sounds
of
the
music
the
dancing
and
the
they
soon
found
their
way
to
the
dwelling
of
when
they
entered
they
saw
the
chief
seated
on
a
throne
surrounded
by
light
and
splendor
everything
was
joy
and
amusement
crowds
of
courtiers
were
in
the
apartment
all
dressed
in
the
most
brilliant
array
the
strangers
looked
around
for
their
friend
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
now
and
then
the
chief
would
cough
when
a
shower
of
silver
ornaments
and
precious
things
would
fly
in
all
directions
and
instantly
a
scramble
would
commence
among
the
company
to
gather
them
up
and
appropriate
them
as
they
thus
rushed
forward
the
saw
their
poor
little
friend
crowded
up
into
a
corner
where
nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
except
to
push
him
aside
or
step
on
him
whenever
he
was
in
the
way
he
uttered
piteous
little
squeaks
as
one
and
another
would
thus
maltreat
him
but
he
was
too
busy
taking
care
of
himself
to
perceive
that
those
whom
he
had
left
snug
at
home
in
the
lodge
were
witnesses
of
all
that
was
going
on
at
length
the
signal
was
given
for
the
company
to
retire
all
but
the
two
young
damsels
upon
whom
had
set
his
eye
and
to
whom
he
had
sent
by
one
of
his
assistants
great
offers
to
induce
them
to
remain
with
him
and
become
his
wives
poor
returned
to
his
lodge
but
what
was
his
consternation
to
find
the
door
open
ho
grandmother
cried
he
is
this
the
way
you
keep
watch
the
old
woman
started
up
there
are
my
said
she
pointing
to
the
two
logs
of
wood
threw
himself
on
the
ground
between
them
his
back
was
broken
by
coming
so
violently
in
contact
with
them
but
that
he
did
not
mind
he
thought
only
of
revenge
and
the
recovery
of
his
sweethearts
he
waited
but
to
get
some
powerful
poison
and
prepare
it
and
then
he
stole
softly
back
to
the
wigwam
of
all
was
silent
and
he
crept
in
without
making
the
slightest
noise
there
lay
the
chief
with
a
young
girl
on
each
side
of
him
they
were
all
sound
asleep
the
chief
lying
on
his
back
with
his
mouth
wide
open
before
he
was
aware
of
it
the
poison
was
down
his
throat
and
had
retreated
quietly
to
his
own
lodge
the
next
morning
the
cry
went
through
the
village
that
had
been
found
dead
in
his
bed
of
course
it
was
attributed
to
at
the
feast
all
was
grief
and
lamentation
let
us
go
and
tell
poor
said
one
he
was
so
fond
of
they
found
him
sitting
on
a
bank
fishing
he
had
been
up
at
peep
of
day
to
make
preparation
for
receiving
the
intelligence
he
had
caught
two
or
three
fish
and
extracting
their
bladders
had
filled
them
with
blood
and
tied
them
under
his
arm
when
the
friends
of
saw
him
they
called
out
to
him
oh
your
friend
is
dead
with
a
gesture
of
despair
drew
his
knife
and
plunged
it
not
into
his
heart
but
into
the
bladders
filled
with
blood
that
he
had
prepared
as
he
fell
apparently
lifeless
to
the
ground
the
messengers
began
to
reproach
themselves
oh
why
did
we
tell
him
so
suddenly
we
might
have
known
he
would
not
survive
it
poor
he
loved
so
to
their
great
surprise
the
day
after
the
funeral
came
walking
towards
the
wigwam
of
the
dead
chief
as
he
walked
he
sang
or
rather
chaunted
to
a
monotonous
strain
the
following
is
dead
is
dead
i
know
who
killed
him
i
guess
it
was
i
i
guess
it
was
i
all
the
village
was
aroused
everybody
flew
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
but
he
evaded
them
and
escaped
to
a
place
of
safety
soon
after
he
again
made
his
appearance
mincing
as
he
walked
and
singing
to
the
same
strain
as
before
if
you
wish
to
take
and
punish
me
let
the
widows
come
and
catch
me
it
seemed
a
good
idea
and
the
young
women
were
recommended
to
go
and
entice
the
culprit
into
the
village
so
that
the
friends
of
the
deceased
could
lay
hold
of
him
they
went
forth
on
their
errand
would
suffer
them
to
approach
then
he
would
dance
off
a
little
now
he
would
allow
them
to
come
quite
near
anon
he
would
retreat
a
little
before
them
all
the
time
singing
come
pretty
widows
come
and
catch
me
thus
he
decoyed
them
on
occasionally
using
honeyed
words
and
flattering
speeches
until
he
had
gained
their
consent
to
return
with
him
to
his
lodge
and
take
up
their
abode
with
him
the
friends
of
the
murdered
chief
were
scandalized
at
such
inconstancy
and
resolved
to
punish
all
three
as
soon
as
they
could
catch
them
they
surrounded
his
lodge
with
cries
and
threatenings
but
and
his
two
brides
had
contrived
to
elude
their
vigilance
and
gain
his
canoe
which
lay
in
the
river
close
at
hand
hardly
were
they
on
board
when
their
escape
was
discovered
the
whole
troop
flew
after
them
some
plunged
into
the
stream
and
seized
the
canoe
in
the
struggle
it
was
upset
but
immediately
on
touching
the
water
whether
from
the
magical
properties
of
the
canoe
or
the
necromantic
skill
of
the
grandmother
they
were
transformed
into
ducks
and
flew
quacking
away
since
that
time
the
of
this
species
are
always
found
in
companies
of
three
two
females
and
a
male
the
de
or
mallard
and
the
or
wood
duck
are
of
different
habits
from
the
foregoing
flying
in
pairs
indeed
the
constancy
of
the
latter
is
said
to
be
so
great
that
if
he
loses
his
mate
he
never
takes
another
partner
but
goes
mourning
to
the
end
of
his
days
chapter
xxxi
a
visit
to
green
bay
swamp
the
payment
over
and
the
indians
dispersed
we
prepared
ourselves
to
settle
down
quietly
in
our
little
home
but
now
a
new
source
of
disturbance
arose
my
husband
accounts
of
disbursements
as
agent
of
the
winnebagoes
which
he
had
forwarded
to
the
department
at
washington
had
failed
to
reach
there
of
which
he
received
due
notice
that
is
to
say
such
a
notice
as
could
reach
us
by
the
circuitous
and
uncertain
mode
of
conveyance
by
which
intercourse
with
the
eastern
world
was
then
kept
up
if
the
vouchers
for
the
former
expenditures
together
with
the
recent
payment
of
annuity
money
should
not
be
forthcoming
it
might
place
him
in
a
very
awkward
position
he
therefore
decided
to
go
at
once
to
washington
and
be
the
bearer
himself
of
his
duplicate
accounts
should
you
like
to
go
and
see
your
father
and
mother
said
he
to
me
one
morning
and
show
them
how
the
west
agrees
with
you
it
was
a
most
joyful
suggestion
after
a
year
separation
and
in
a
few
days
all
things
were
in
readiness
for
our
departure
there
was
visiting
us
at
that
time
miss
brush
of
detroit
who
had
come
from
green
bay
with
and
whitney
and
miss
frances
henshaw
on
an
excursion
to
the
mississippi
our
little
house
had
contrived
to
expand
itself
for
the
accommodation
of
the
whole
party
during
the
very
pleasant
visit
they
made
us
the
arrival
of
two
young
ladies
had
been
as
may
be
imagined
quite
a
godsend
to
the
unmarried
lieutenants
and
when
tired
of
the
journey
or
intimidated
by
the
snow
which
fell
eight
inches
on
the
of
october
miss
brush
determined
to
give
up
the
remainder
of
her
excursion
and
accept
our
pressing
invitation
to
remain
with
us
until
the
return
of
her
friends
we
were
looked
upon
as
public
benefactors
she
was
now
to
accompany
us
to
green
bay
and
possibly
to
detroit
our
voyage
down
the
river
was
without
incident
and
we
reached
green
bay
just
as
all
the
place
was
astir
in
the
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
one
of
newbery
schooners
this
important
event
was
the
subject
of
interest
to
the
whole
community
from
fort
howard
to
dickenson
to
some
its
arrival
would
bring
friends
to
some
supplies
to
the
ladies
the
fashions
to
the
gentlemen
the
news
for
it
was
the
happy
bearer
of
the
mails
not
for
that
place
alone
but
for
all
the
upper
country
in
a
few
days
the
vessel
arrived
she
brought
a
mail
for
fort
winnebago
it
being
only
in
the
winter
season
that
letters
were
carried
by
land
to
that
place
via
and
chicago
in
virtue
of
his
office
as
postmaster
my
husband
opened
the
and
took
possession
of
his
own
letters
one
informed
him
of
the
satisfactory
appearance
at
the
department
of
the
missing
accounts
but
oh
sad
disappointment
another
brought
the
news
that
my
parents
had
gone
to
kentucky
for
the
winter
not
to
any
city
or
accessible
place
but
up
the
sandy
and
over
among
the
mountains
of
virginia
hunting
up
old
belonging
to
my
grandfather
estate
it
was
vain
to
hope
to
follow
them
we
might
hardly
expect
to
find
them
during
the
short
period
we
could
be
absent
from
home
not
even
were
we
to
receive
the
lucid
directions
once
given
my
father
by
an
old
settler
during
his
explorations
through
that
wild
region
you
must
go
up
said
the
man
and
down
and
fall
over
on
to
we
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
undertake
such
an
expedition
and
therefore
made
up
our
minds
to
retrace
our
steps
to
fort
winnebago
no
boats
were
in
readiness
to
ascend
the
river
our
old
friend
hamilton
promised
to
have
one
in
preparation
at
once
but
time
passed
by
and
no
boat
was
made
ready
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
november
we
were
passing
our
time
very
pleasantly
with
the
irwins
and
whitneys
and
at
the
residence
of
colonel
stambaugh
the
indian
agent
but
still
this
delay
was
inconvenient
and
vexatious
i
suggested
undertaking
the
journey
on
horseback
no
indeed
was
the
answer
i
invariably
received
no
mortal
woman
has
ever
gone
that
road
unless
it
was
some
native
on
foot
nor
ever
could
but
suppose
we
set
out
in
the
boat
and
get
frozen
in
on
the
way
we
can
neither
pass
the
winter
there
nor
possibly
find
our
way
to
a
human
habitation
we
have
had
one
similar
experience
already
is
it
not
better
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
can
do
what
you
and
others
of
your
sex
have
done
finley
the
at
fort
howard
on
hearing
the
matter
debated
offered
me
immediately
his
favorite
horse
charlie
he
is
very
the
doctor
alleged
and
capital
in
a
marsh
or
troublesome
stream
by
land
then
it
was
decided
to
go
and
as
soon
as
our
old
menomonee
friend
who
was
as
good
a
guide
by
land
as
by
water
could
be
summoned
we
set
off
leaving
our
trunks
to
be
forwarded
by
hamilton
whenever
it
should
please
him
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
sending
up
his
boat
we
waited
until
a
late
hour
on
the
morning
of
our
departure
for
our
wing
of
monroe
and
philleo
of
galena
but
finding
they
did
not
join
us
we
resolved
to
lose
no
time
confident
that
we
should
all
meet
at
the
kakalin
in
the
course
of
the
evening
after
crossing
the
river
at
what
is
now
depere
and
entering
the
wild
unsettled
country
on
the
west
of
the
river
we
found
a
succession
of
wooded
hills
separated
by
ravines
so
narrow
and
steep
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
animals
but
mules
or
goats
could
make
their
way
among
them
took
the
lead
the
horse
he
rode
was
accustomed
to
the
country
and
well
trained
to
this
style
of
road
as
for
charlie
he
was
perfectly
admirable
when
he
came
to
a
precipitous
descent
he
would
set
forward
his
forefeet
and
slide
down
on
his
haunches
in
the
most
scientific
manner
while
my
only
mode
of
preserving
my
balance
was
to
hold
fast
by
the
bridle
and
lay
myself
braced
almost
flat
against
his
back
then
our
position
would
suddenly
change
and
we
would
be
scaling
the
opposite
bank
at
the
imminent
risk
of
falling
backward
into
the
ravine
below
it
was
amusing
to
see
as
he
scrambled
on
ahead
now
and
then
turning
partly
round
to
see
how
i
fared
and
when
panting
and
laughing
i
at
length
reached
the
summit
he
would
throw
up
his
hands
and
shout
with
the
utmost
glee
mamma
manitou
my
mother
is
a
spirit
our
old
acquaintances
the
grignons
seemed
much
surprised
that
i
should
have
ventured
on
such
a
journey
they
had
never
undertaken
it
although
they
had
lived
so
long
at
the
kakalin
but
then
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
have
done
so
they
could
always
command
a
canoe
or
a
boat
when
they
wished
to
visit
the
bay
as
we
had
anticipated
our
gentlemen
joined
us
at
supper
they
had
delayed
to
take
dinner
with
colonel
stambaugh
had
had
a
delightful
gallop
up
from
the
bay
had
seen
no
ravines
nor
anything
but
fine
smooth
roads
might
have
been
asleep
but
if
so
were
not
conscious
of
it
this
was
the
account
they
gave
of
themselves
to
our
no
small
amusement
from
the
kakalin
to
the
butte
des
morts
where
lived
a
man
named
knaggs
was
our
next
day
stage
the
country
was
rough
and
wild
much
like
that
we
had
passed
through
the
spring
before
in
going
from
diggings
to
kellogg
grove
but
we
were
fortunate
in
having
rather
than
uncle
billy
for
our
guide
so
that
we
could
make
our
way
with
some
degree
of
moderation
we
had
travelled
but
forty
miles
when
we
reached
knaggs
yet
i
was
both
cold
and
fatigued
so
that
the
cosy
little
room
in
which
we
found
knaggs
and
the
bright
fire
were
most
cheering
objects
and
as
we
had
only
broken
our
fast
since
morning
with
a
few
crackers
we
carried
in
our
pockets
i
must
own
we
did
ample
justice
to
her
nice
coffee
and
cakes
not
to
mention
and
bear
meat
the
latter
of
which
i
had
never
before
tasted
our
supper
over
we
looked
about
for
a
place
of
repose
the
room
in
which
we
had
taken
our
meal
was
of
small
dimensions
just
sufficient
to
accommodate
a
bed
a
table
placed
against
the
wall
and
the
few
chairs
on
which
we
sat
there
was
no
room
for
any
kind
of
a
shakedown
where
can
you
put
us
for
the
night
inquired
my
husband
of
knaggs
when
he
made
his
appearance
why
there
is
no
place
that
i
know
of
unless
you
can
camp
down
in
the
old
building
outside
we
went
to
look
at
it
it
consisted
of
one
room
bare
and
dirty
a
huge
chimney
in
which
a
few
brands
were
burning
occupied
nearly
one
side
of
the
apartment
against
another
was
built
a
rickety
sort
of
bunk
this
was
the
only
vestige
of
furniture
to
be
seen
the
floor
was
thickly
covered
with
mud
and
dirt
in
the
midst
of
which
near
the
fire
was
seated
an
old
indian
with
a
pan
of
boiled
corn
on
his
lap
which
he
was
scooping
up
with
both
hands
and
devouring
with
the
utmost
voracity
we
soon
discovered
that
he
was
blind
on
hearing
footsteps
and
voices
he
instinctively
gathered
his
dish
of
food
close
to
him
and
began
some
morose
grumblings
but
when
he
was
told
that
it
was
who
was
addressing
him
his
features
relaxed
into
a
more
agreeable
expression
and
be
even
held
forth
his
dish
and
invited
us
to
share
its
contents
but
are
we
to
stay
here
i
asked
can
we
not
sleep
we
have
no
tent
replied
my
husband
and
the
weather
is
too
cold
to
risk
the
exposure
without
one
i
could
sit
in
a
chair
all
night
by
the
fire
then
you
would
not
be
able
to
ride
to
bellefontaine
there
was
no
alternative
the
only
thing
knaggs
could
furnish
in
the
shape
of
bedding
was
a
small
the
bunk
was
a
trifle
less
filthy
than
the
floor
so
upon
its
boards
we
spread
first
the
skin
then
our
and
with
a
pair
of
for
a
bolster
i
wrapped
myself
in
my
cloak
and
resigned
myself
to
my
distasteful
accommodations
the
change
of
position
from
that
i
had
occupied
through
the
day
probably
brought
some
rest
but
sleep
i
could
not
even
on
a
softer
and
more
agreeable
couch
the
snoring
of
the
old
indian
and
two
or
three
companions
who
had
joined
him
and
his
frequent
querulous
exclamations
as
he
felt
himself
encroached
upon
in
the
darkness
would
have
effectually
banished
slumber
from
my
eyes
it
was
a
relief
to
rise
with
early
morning
and
prepare
for
the
journey
of
the
day
where
our
had
bestowed
themselves
i
knew
not
but
they
evidently
had
fared
no
better
than
we
they
were
in
fine
spirits
however
and
we
cheerfully
took
our
breakfast
and
were
ferried
over
the
river
to
continue
on
the
trail
from
that
point
to
bellefontaine
twelve
miles
distant
from
fort
winnebago
the
great
of
this
road
swamp
was
the
next
thing
to
be
encountered
we
reached
it
about
nine
it
spread
before
us
a
vast
expanse
of
morass
about
half
a
mile
in
width
and
of
length
interminable
partly
covered
with
water
with
black
knobs
rising
here
and
there
above
the
surface
affording
a
precarious
foothold
for
the
animals
in
crossing
it
where
the
water
was
not
there
lay
in
place
of
it
a
bed
of
black
oozy
mud
which
looked
as
if
it
might
give
way
under
the
foot
and
let
it
at
each
step
sink
to
an
unknown
depth
this
we
were
now
to
traverse
all
three
of
the
gentlemen
went
in
advance
of
me
each
hoping
as
he
said
to
select
the
surest
and
firmest
path
for
me
to
follow
one
and
another
would
call
here
madam
come
this
way
this
is
the
best
path
wifie
follow
me
but
often
charlie
knew
better
than
either
and
selected
a
path
according
to
his
own
judgment
which
proved
the
best
of
the
whole
on
he
went
picking
his
way
so
slowly
and
cautiously
now
pausing
on
one
little
hillock
now
on
another
and
anon
turning
aside
to
avoid
a
patch
of
mud
which
seemed
more
than
usually
suspicious
that
all
the
company
had
got
some
little
distance
ahead
of
me
on
raising
my
eyes
which
had
been
kept
pretty
closely
on
my
horse
footsteps
i
saw
my
husband
on
foot
striving
to
lead
his
horse
by
the
bridle
from
a
difficult
position
into
which
he
had
got
wing
and
his
great
white
floundering
animal
lying
sideways
in
the
mud
the
rider
using
all
his
efforts
to
extricate
himself
from
the
stirrups
and
philleo
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
his
steed
who
was
doing
his
best
to
rise
up
from
a
deep
bog
into
which
he
had
pitched
himself
it
was
a
formidable
sight
they
all
called
out
with
one
accord
oh
do
not
come
this
way
indeed
cried
i
i
have
no
thought
of
it
charlie
and
i
know
better
and
trusting
to
the
sagacious
creature
he
picked
his
way
carefully
along
and
carried
me
safely
past
the
dismounted
company
i
could
not
refrain
from
a
little
triumphant
flourish
with
my
whip
as
i
looked
back
upon
them
and
watched
their
progress
to
their
saddles
once
more
three
hours
had
we
been
thus
unpleasantly
engaged
and
yet
we
were
not
over
the
slough
of
despond
at
length
we
drew
near
its
farthest
verge
here
ran
a
deep
stream
some
five
or
six
feet
in
width
the
gentlemen
as
they
reached
it
dismounted
and
began
debating
what
was
to
be
done
jump
off
jump
off
madam
cried
wing
and
jump
off
jump
off
echoed
philleo
we
are
just
consulting
how
we
are
to
get
you
across
what
do
you
think
about
it
asked
my
husband
charlie
will
show
you
replied
i
come
charlie
and
as
i
raised
his
bridle
quickly
with
a
pat
on
his
neck
and
an
encouraging
chirp
he
bounded
over
the
stream
as
lightly
as
a
deer
and
landed
me
safe
on
poor
wing
had
fared
the
worst
of
the
company
the
clumsy
animal
he
rode
seeming
to
be
of
opinion
when
he
got
into
a
difficulty
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
lie
down
and
resign
himself
to
his
fate
while
his
rider
not
being
particularly
light
and
agile
was
generally
undermost
and
half
imbedded
in
the
mire
before
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
course
of
action
it
was
therefore
a
wise
movement
in
him
when
he
reached
the
little
stream
to
plunge
into
it
and
wade
across
thus
washing
out
as
much
as
possible
the
traces
of
the
morning
adventures
from
himself
and
his
steed
and
the
other
gentlemen
having
no
alternative
concluded
to
follow
his
example
we
did
not
halt
long
on
the
rising
ground
beyond
the
morass
for
we
had
a
long
stretch
before
us
to
bellefontaine
miles
and
those
none
of
the
shortest
our
horses
travelled
admirably
the
whole
afternoon
charlie
keeping
a
canter
all
the
way
but
it
was
growing
dark
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
landmarks
which
were
to
indicate
our
near
approach
to
the
desired
haven
can
we
not
stop
and
rest
for
a
few
moments
under
one
of
the
trees
inquired
i
for
i
was
almost
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
to
add
to
our
discomfort
a
cold
november
rain
was
pouring
upon
us
if
it
were
possible
we
would
was
the
reply
but
see
how
dark
it
is
growing
if
we
should
lose
our
way
it
would
be
worse
than
being
wet
and
tired
so
we
kept
on
just
at
dark
we
crossed
a
clear
stream
that
said
my
husband
is
i
think
two
miles
from
bellefontaine
cheer
up
we
shall
soon
be
there
quite
encouraged
we
pursued
our
way
more
cheerfully
mile
after
mile
we
passed
but
still
no
light
gleamed
friendly
through
the
trees
we
have
certainly
travelled
more
than
six
miles
now
said
i
yes
that
could
not
have
been
the
creek
it
was
eight
when
we
reached
bellefontaine
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
made
cheerful
by
a
huge
blazing
fire
wing
and
philleo
had
arrived
before
us
and
there
were
other
travellers
on
their
way
from
the
mississippi
i
was
received
with
great
kindness
and
volubility
by
the
immense
hostess
la
grosse
américaine
as
she
was
called
and
she
soon
installed
me
in
the
in
the
warmest
corner
and
in
due
time
set
an
excellent
supper
before
us
but
her
hospitality
did
not
extend
to
giving
up
her
only
bed
for
my
accommodation
she
spread
all
the
things
she
could
muster
on
the
hard
floor
before
the
fire
and
did
what
she
could
to
make
me
comfortable
then
observing
my
husband
solicitude
lest
i
might
feel
ill
from
the
effects
of
the
fatigue
and
rain
she
remarked
in
tones
of
admiring
sympathy
how
kind
your
is
to
you
an
expression
which
as
it
was
then
new
to
us
amused
us
not
a
little
our
travelling
companions
started
early
in
the
morning
for
the
fort
which
was
but
twelve
miles
distant
and
they
were
so
kind
as
to
take
charge
of
a
note
to
our
friends
at
home
requesting
them
to
send
plante
with
the
carriage
to
take
us
the
rest
of
the
distance
we
reached
the
portage
in
safety
and
thus
ended
the
first
journey
by
land
that
any
white
woman
had
made
from
green
bay
to
fort
winnebago
i
felt
not
a
little
raised
in
my
own
esteem
when
my
husband
informed
me
that
the
distance
i
had
the
previous
day
travelled
from
knaggs
to
bellefontaine
was
miles
chapter
xxxii
commencement
of
the
sauk
war
a
few
weeks
after
our
return
my
husband
took
his
mother
to
prairie
du
chien
for
the
benefit
of
medical
advice
from
beaumont
of
the
army
the
journey
was
made
in
a
large
open
boat
down
the
wisconsin
river
and
it
was
proposed
to
take
this
opportunity
to
bring
back
a
good
supply
of
corn
for
the
winter
use
of
both
men
and
cattle
the
ice
formed
in
the
river
however
so
early
that
after
starting
with
his
load
he
was
obliged
to
return
with
it
to
the
prairie
and
wait
until
the
thick
winter
ice
enabled
him
to
make
a
second
journey
and
bring
it
up
in
sleighs
with
so
great
an
expense
of
time
labor
and
exposure
were
the
necessaries
of
life
conveyed
from
one
point
to
another
through
that
wild
and
desolate
region
the
arrival
of
my
brother
arthur
from
kentucky
by
way
of
the
mississippi
in
the
latter
part
of
april
brought
us
the
uncomfortable
intelligence
of
new
troubles
with
the
sauks
and
foxes
black
hawk
had
with
the
flower
of
his
nation
recrossed
the
mississippi
once
more
to
take
possession
of
their
old
homes
and
it
was
not
long
before
our
own
indians
came
flocking
in
to
confirm
the
tidings
and
to
assure
us
of
their
intention
to
remain
faithful
friends
to
the
americans
we
soon
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
illinois
rangers
in
the
rock
river
country
also
of
the
progress
of
the
regular
force
under
general
atkinson
in
pursuit
of
the
hostile
indians
who
by
the
reports
were
always
able
to
elude
their
vigilance
it
not
being
their
custom
to
stop
and
give
battle
the
sauks
soon
scattered
themselves
through
the
country
trusting
to
some
lucky
accident
and
such
arrived
alas
only
too
often
to
enable
them
to
fall
upon
their
enemies
unexpectedly
the
experience
of
the
pursuing
army
was
for
the
most
part
to
make
their
way
by
toilsome
and
fatiguing
marches
to
the
spot
where
they
imagined
the
sauks
would
be
waiting
to
receive
them
and
then
to
discover
that
the
rogues
had
scampered
off
to
quite
a
different
part
of
the
country
wherever
these
latter
went
their
course
was
marked
by
the
most
atrocious
barbarities
though
the
worst
had
not
at
this
time
reached
our
ears
we
were
only
assured
that
they
were
down
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
rock
river
and
kishwaukee
and
that
they
lost
no
opportunity
of
falling
upon
the
defenceless
inhabitants
and
cruelly
murdering
them
as
soon
as
it
became
certain
that
the
sauks
and
foxes
would
not
pursue
the
same
course
they
had
on
the
previous
year
that
is
retreat
peaceably
across
the
mississippi
kinzie
resolved
to
hold
a
council
with
all
the
principal
chiefs
of
the
winnebagoes
who
were
accessible
at
this
time
he
knew
that
the
sauks
would
use
every
effort
to
induce
their
neighbors
to
join
them
and
that
there
existed
in
the
breasts
of
too
many
of
the
young
savages
a
desire
to
distinguish
themselves
by
taking
some
white
scalps
they
did
not
love
the
americans
why
should
they
by
them
they
had
been
gradually
dispossessed
of
the
broad
and
beautiful
domains
of
their
forefathers
and
hunted
from
place
to
place
and
the
only
equivalent
they
had
received
in
exchange
had
been
a
few
thousands
annually
in
silver
and
presents
together
with
the
pernicious
example
the
debasing
influence
and
the
positive
ill
treatment
of
too
many
of
the
new
settlers
upon
their
lands
with
all
these
facts
in
view
therefore
their
father
felt
that
the
utmost
watchfulness
was
necessary
and
that
the
strongest
arguments
must
be
brought
forward
to
preserve
the
young
men
of
the
winnebagoes
in
their
allegiance
to
the
americans
of
the
older
members
he
felt
quite
sure
about
fifty
lodges
had
come
at
the
commencement
of
the
disturbances
and
encamped
around
our
dwelling
saying
that
if
the
sauks
attacked
us
it
must
be
after
killing
them
and
knowing
them
well
we
had
perfect
confidence
in
their
assurances
but
their
vicinity
while
it
gave
us
a
feeling
of
protection
likewise
furnished
us
with
a
channel
of
the
most
exciting
and
agitating
daily
communications
as
the
theatre
of
operations
approached
nearer
and
nearer
intelligence
was
brought
in
by
their
runners
now
that
captain
barney
head
had
been
recognized
in
the
sauk
camp
where
it
had
been
brought
the
day
previous
next
that
the
sauks
were
carrying
lieutenant
beall
head
on
a
pole
in
front
of
them
as
they
marched
to
meet
the
whites
sometimes
it
was
a
story
which
we
afterwards
found
to
be
unhappily
true
as
that
of
the
murder
of
their
agent
st
vrain
at
kellogg
grove
by
the
sauks
themselves
who
ought
to
have
protected
him
it
was
after
the
news
of
this
last
occurrence
that
the
appointed
council
with
the
winnebagoes
was
to
be
held
at
the
four
lakes
miles
distant
from
fort
winnebago
in
vain
we
pleaded
and
remonstrated
against
such
an
exposure
it
was
his
duty
to
assemble
his
people
and
talk
to
them
my
husband
said
and
he
must
run
the
risk
if
there
were
any
he
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
winnebagoes
the
enemy
by
all
he
could
learn
were
now
far
distant
from
the
four
lakes
probably
at
he
would
set
off
early
in
the
morning
with
paquette
bold
his
council
and
return
to
us
the
same
evening
it
were
useless
to
attempt
to
describe
our
feelings
during
that
long
and
dreary
day
when
night
arrived
the
cry
of
a
drunken
indian
or
even
the
barking
of
a
dog
would
fill
our
hearts
with
terror
as
we
sat
at
a
late
hour
at
the
open
window
listening
to
every
sound
with
what
joy
did
we
at
length
distinguish
the
tramp
of
horses
we
knew
it
to
be
griffin
and
jerry
ascending
the
hill
and
a
cheerful
shout
soon
announced
that
all
was
well
my
husband
and
his
interpreter
had
ridden
seventy
miles
that
day
besides
holding
a
long
talk
with
the
indians
the
winnebagoes
in
council
had
promised
to
use
their
utmost
endeavors
to
preserve
peace
and
good
order
among
their
young
men
they
informed
their
father
that
the
bands
on
the
rock
river
with
the
exception
of
were
all
determined
to
remain
friendly
and
keep
aloof
from
the
sauks
to
that
end
they
were
abandoning
their
villages
and
and
moving
north
that
their
great
father
the
president
might
not
feel
dissatisfied
with
them
with
regard
to
and
his
people
they
professed
themselves
unable
to
answer
time
went
on
and
brought
with
it
stories
of
fresh
outrages
among
these
were
the
murders
of
auberry
green
and
force
at
blue
mound
and
the
attack
on
apple
fort
the
tidings
of
the
latter
were
brought
by
old
crély
the
father
of
paquette
who
rode
express
from
galena
and
who
averred
that
he
once
passed
a
bush
behind
which
the
sauks
were
hiding
but
that
his
horse
smelt
the
grass
with
which
they
always
adorn
their
persons
when
on
a
and
set
out
on
such
a
gallop
that
he
never
stopped
until
he
arrived
at
the
portage
another
bearer
of
news
was
a
young
gentleman
named
follett
whose
eyes
had
become
so
protruded
and
set
from
keeping
an
anxious
for
the
enemy
that
it
was
many
days
after
his
arrival
at
a
place
of
safety
before
they
resumed
their
accustomed
limits
and
expression
among
other
rumors
which
at
this
time
reached
us
was
one
that
an
attack
upon
fort
winnebago
was
in
contemplation
among
the
sauks
that
this
was
in
no
state
of
defence
the
indians
very
well
knew
all
the
effective
men
had
been
withdrawn
upon
a
requisition
from
general
atkinson
to
join
him
at
his
fort
at
fort
winnebago
was
not
picketed
in
there
were
no
defences
to
the
barracks
or
officers
quarters
except
slight
panelled
doors
and
venetian
blinds
nothing
that
would
long
resist
the
blows
of
clubs
or
hatchets
there
was
no
artillery
and
the
commissary
store
was
without
the
bounds
of
the
fort
under
the
hill
kinzie
had
from
the
first
called
the
attention
of
the
officers
to
the
insecurity
of
their
position
in
case
of
danger
but
he
generally
received
a
scoffing
answer
never
fear
they
would
say
the
sauks
are
not
coming
here
to
attack
us
one
afternoon
we
were
over
on
a
visit
to
some
ladies
in
the
garrison
and
several
officers
being
present
the
conversation
as
usual
turned
upon
the
present
position
of
affairs
do
you
not
think
it
wiser
inquired
i
of
a
blustering
young
officer
to
be
prepared
against
possible
danger
not
against
these
fellows
replied
he
contemptuously
i
do
not
think
i
would
even
take
the
trouble
to
fasten
the
blinds
to
my
quarters
at
least
said
i
if
you
some
night
find
a
tomahawk
raised
to
cleave
your
skull
you
will
have
the
consolation
of
remembering
that
you
have
not
been
one
of
those
foolish
fellows
who
keep
on
the
safe
side
he
seemed
a
little
nettled
at
this
and
still
more
so
when
sister
margaret
observed
for
my
part
i
am
of
governor
cass
opinion
he
was
at
chicago
during
the
winnebago
war
we
were
all
preparing
to
move
into
the
fort
on
the
first
alarm
some
were
for
being
brave
and
delaying
like
our
friends
here
come
said
the
governor
into
the
fort
as
fast
as
possible
there
is
no
merit
in
being
brave
with
the
indians
it
is
the
height
of
folly
to
stay
and
meet
danger
which
you
may
by
prudence
avoid
in
a
few
days
our
friends
waked
up
to
the
conviction
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
the
first
step
was
to
forbid
any
winnebago
coming
within
the
garrison
lest
they
should
find
out
what
they
had
known
as
well
as
ourselves
for
three
months
past
namely
the
feebleness
of
the
means
of
resistance
the
next
was
to
send
into
the
woods
under
the
protection
of
a
guard
to
cut
pickets
for
inclosing
the
garrison
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
enemy
were
not
very
far
distant
and
that
their
object
in
coming
north
was
to
break
a
way
into
the
chippewa
country
where
they
would
find
a
place
of
security
among
their
friends
and
allies
the
story
that
our
indian
runners
brought
in
most
frequently
was
that
the
sauks
were
determined
to
fall
upon
the
whites
at
the
portage
and
fort
and
massacre
all
except
the
families
of
the
agent
and
interpreter
plante
and
pillon
with
their
families
had
departed
at
the
first
word
of
danger
there
only
remained
with
us
manaigre
whose
wife
was
a
isidore
morrin
and
the
blacksmiths
from
sugar
creek
mâtâ
and
turcotte
at
night
we
were
all
regularly
armed
and
our
posts
assigned
us
after
every
means
had
been
taken
to
make
the
house
secure
the
orders
were
given
sister
margaret
and
i
in
case
of
attack
were
to
mount
with
the
children
to
the
rooms
above
while
my
husband
and
his
men
were
to
make
good
their
defence
as
long
as
possible
against
the
enemy
since
i
had
shown
my
sportsmanship
by
bringing
down
accidentally
a
blackbird
on
the
wing
i
felt
as
if
i
could
do
some
execution
with
my
little
pistols
which
were
regularly
placed
beside
my
pillow
at
night
and
i
was
fully
resolved
to
use
them
if
necessity
required
i
do
not
remember
to
have
felt
the
slightest
compunction
at
the
idea
of
taking
the
lives
of
two
sauks
as
i
had
no
doubt
i
should
do
and
this
explains
to
me
what
i
had
before
often
wondered
at
the
indifference
namely
of
the
soldier
on
the
field
of
battle
to
the
destruction
of
human
life
had
i
been
called
upon
however
to
use
my
weapons
effectually
i
should
no
doubt
have
looked
back
upon
it
with
horror
surrounded
as
we
were
by
indian
lodges
which
seldom
became
perfectly
quiet
and
excited
as
our
nerves
had
become
by
all
that
we
were
daily
in
the
habit
of
hearing
we
rarely
slept
very
soundly
one
night
after
we
had
as
much
as
possible
composed
ourselves
we
were
startled
at
a
late
hour
by
a
tap
upon
the
window
at
the
head
of
our
bed
and
a
call
of
chon
chon
john
john
what
is
it
it
was
the
little
elk
he
spoke
rapidly
and
in
a
tone
of
great
agitation
i
could
not
understand
him
and
i
lay
trembling
and
dreading
to
hear
his
errand
interpreted
now
and
then
i
could
distinguish
the
words
sauks
and
horse
and
they
were
not
very
reassuring
the
trouble
i
soon
learned
was
this
a
fresh
trail
had
been
observed
near
the
petit
rocher
on
the
wisconsin
and
the
people
at
the
villages
on
the
barribault
were
in
a
state
of
great
alarm
fearing
it
might
be
the
sauks
there
was
the
appearance
of
a
hundred
or
more
horses
having
passed
by
this
trail
had
been
dispatched
at
once
to
tell
their
father
and
to
ask
his
advice
after
listening
to
all
he
had
to
communicate
his
father
told
him
the
trail
was
undoubtedly
that
of
general
henry
troops
who
were
said
to
have
come
north
looking
for
the
enemy
that
as
the
marks
of
the
hoofs
showed
them
by
this
report
to
have
been
shod
that
was
sufficient
proof
that
it
was
not
the
trail
of
the
sauks
he
thought
that
the
people
at
the
villages
need
not
feel
any
uneasiness
very
well
father
replied
i
will
go
back
and
tell
my
people
what
you
say
they
will
believe
you
for
you
always
tell
them
the
truth
you
are
not
like
us
indians
who
sometimes
deceive
each
other
so
saying
he
returned
to
his
friends
much
comforted
the
completion
of
the
picketing
and
other
defences
together
with
the
arrival
of
a
detachment
of
troops
from
fort
howard
under
lieutenant
hunter
at
our
fort
now
seemed
to
render
the
latter
the
place
of
greatest
safety
we
therefore
regularly
every
evening
immediately
before
dusk
took
up
our
line
of
march
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
repaired
to
quarters
that
had
been
assigned
us
within
the
garrison
leaving
our
own
house
and
chattels
to
the
care
of
the
frenchmen
and
our
friends
the
winnebagoes
it
was
on
one
of
these
days
that
we
were
sitting
at
the
windows
which
looked
out
over
the
portage
indeed
we
seldom
sat
anywhere
else
our
almost
sole
occupation
being
to
look
abroad
and
see
what
was
coming
next
when
a
loud
long
shrill
whoop
from
a
distance
gave
notice
of
something
to
be
heard
the
what
could
it
portend
what
were
we
about
to
hear
by
gazing
intently
towards
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
road
we
could
perceive
a
moving
body
of
horsemen
which
as
they
approached
we
saw
to
be
indians
they
were
in
full
costume
scarlet
streamers
fluttered
at
the
ends
of
their
lances
their
arms
glittered
in
the
sun
presently
as
they
drew
nearer
their
paint
and
feathers
and
brooches
became
visible
there
were
fifty
or
more
warriors
they
passed
the
road
which
turns
to
the
fort
and
rode
directly
up
the
hill
leading
to
the
agency
was
absent
the
interpreter
had
been
sent
for
on
the
first
distant
appearance
of
the
strangers
but
had
not
yet
arrived
the
party
having
ascended
the
hill
halted
near
the
blacksmith
shop
but
did
not
dismount
our
hearts
trembled
it
must
surely
be
the
enemy
at
this
moment
my
husband
appeared
from
the
direction
of
the
interpreter
house
we
called
to
entreat
him
to
stop
but
he
walked
along
towards
the
to
our
infinite
joy
we
saw
the
chief
of
the
party
dismount
and
all
the
others
following
his
example
and
approaching
to
shake
hands
a
space
was
soon
cleared
around
the
leader
and
my
husband
when
the
former
commenced
an
oration
flourishing
his
sword
and
using
much
violent
gesticulation
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
an
indian
armed
with
that
weapon
and
i
dreaded
to
perceive
it
in
such
hands
sometimes
he
appeared
as
if
he
were
about
to
take
off
the
head
of
his
auditor
at
a
blow
and
our
hearts
sank
as
we
remembered
the
stratagems
at
mackinac
and
detroit
in
former
days
at
length
the
speech
was
concluded
another
shaking
of
hands
took
place
and
we
saw
my
husband
leading
the
way
to
his
storehouse
from
which
some
of
his
men
presently
brought
tobacco
and
pipes
and
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
chief
our
suspense
was
soon
relieved
by
being
informed
that
the
strangers
were
the
principal
chief
of
the
rock
river
indians
who
had
come
with
his
band
to
hold
a
talk
and
bring
information
these
indians
were
under
the
special
care
of
henry
gratiot
and
his
efforts
had
been
most
judicious
and
unremitting
in
preserving
the
good
feeling
of
this
the
most
dangerous
portion
of
the
winnebagoes
the
intelligence
that
who
was
a
most
noble
indian
in
appearance
and
character
brought
us
confirmed
that
already
received
namely
that
the
sauks
were
gradually
drawing
north
towards
the
portage
although
he
evidently
did
not
know
exactly
their
whereabouts
there
was
soon
after
they
had
taken
leave
an
arrival
of
another
party
of
winnebagoes
and
these
requested
permission
to
dance
for
their
father
the
compliment
having
been
accepted
they
assembled
as
usual
on
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
house
my
sister
the
children
and
myself
stationed
ourselves
at
the
open
windows
according
to
custom
and
my
husband
sat
on
the
broad
step
before
the
door
which
opened
from
the
outer
air
directly
into
the
parlor
where
we
were
the
performance
commenced
and
as
the
dancers
proceeded
following
each
other
round
and
round
in
the
progress
of
the
dance
my
sister
mrs
helm
remarked
to
me
look
at
that
small
dark
indian
with
the
green
boughs
on
his
person
that
is
sauk
they
always
mark
themselves
in
this
manner
with
white
clay
and
ornament
themselves
with
leaves
when
they
dance
in
truth
i
had
never
seen
this
costume
among
our
own
indians
and
as
i
gazed
at
this
one
with
green
chaplets
round
his
head
and
his
legs
and
even
his
gun
wreathed
in
the
same
manner
while
his
body
displayed
no
paint
except
the
white
transverse
streaks
with
which
it
was
covered
i
saw
that
he
was
indeed
a
stranger
without
owing
anything
to
the
exaggeration
of
fear
his
countenance
was
truly
ferocious
he
held
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
every
time
the
course
of
the
dance
brought
him
directly
in
front
of
where
we
sat
he
would
turn
his
gaze
full
upon
us
and
club
his
weapon
before
him
with
what
we
interpreted
into
an
air
of
defiance
we
sat
as
still
as
death
for
we
knew
it
would
not
be
wise
to
exhibit
any
appearance
of
fear
but
my
sister
remarked
in
a
low
tone
i
have
always
thought
that
i
was
to
lose
my
life
by
the
hands
of
the
indians
this
is
the
third
indian
war
i
have
gone
through
and
now
i
suppose
it
will
be
the
last
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
her
lose
her
she
was
always
remarkably
calm
and
resolute
but
now
i
could
see
that
she
trembled
still
we
sat
there
there
was
a
sort
of
fascination
as
our
imaginations
became
more
and
more
excited
presently
some
began
to
fall
the
indians
continued
their
dance
for
a
few
minutes
longer
then
with
whoopings
and
shoutings
they
rushed
simultaneously
towards
the
house
we
fled
into
my
apartment
and
closed
the
door
which
my
sister
at
first
held
fast
but
she
presently
came
and
seated
herself
by
me
on
the
bed
for
she
saw
that
i
could
not
compose
myself
of
all
forms
of
death
that
by
the
hands
of
savages
is
the
most
difficult
to
face
calmly
and
i
fully
believed
that
our
hour
was
come
there
was
no
interruption
to
the
dance
which
the
indians
carried
on
in
the
parlor
leaping
and
yelling
as
if
they
would
bring
down
the
roof
over
our
heads
in
vain
we
tried
to
persuade
my
husband
and
the
children
through
a
crevice
of
the
door
to
come
and
join
us
the
latter
feeling
no
danger
were
too
much
delighted
with
the
exhibition
to
leave
it
and
the
former
only
came
for
a
moment
to
reassure
me
and
then
judged
it
wisest
to
return
and
manifest
his
satisfaction
at
the
compliment
by
his
presence
he
made
light
of
our
fears
and
would
not
admit
that
the
object
of
our
suspicions
was
in
fact
a
sauk
but
only
some
young
winnebago
who
had
as
is
sometimes
the
custom
imitated
them
in
costume
and
appearance
it
may
have
been
good
fun
to
him
to
return
to
his
village
and
tell
how
he
frightened
the
white
squaws
such
a
trick
would
not
be
unnatural
in
a
white
youth
and
perhaps
since
human
nature
is
everywhere
the
same
it
might
not
be
out
of
the
way
in
an
indian
chapter
xxxiii
fleeing
from
the
indians
the
danger
had
now
become
so
imminent
that
my
husband
determined
to
send
his
family
to
fort
howard
a
point
which
was
believed
to
be
far
out
of
the
range
of
the
enemy
it
was
in
vain
that
i
pleaded
to
be
permitted
to
remain
he
was
firm
i
must
not
leave
my
post
said
he
while
there
is
any
danger
my
departure
would
perhaps
be
the
signal
for
an
immediate
alliance
of
the
winnebagoes
with
the
sauks
i
am
certain
that
as
long
as
i
am
here
my
presence
will
act
as
a
restraint
upon
them
you
wish
to
remain
and
share
my
dangers
your
doing
so
would
expose
us
both
to
certain
destruction
in
case
of
attack
by
the
aid
of
my
friends
in
both
tribes
i
could
hope
to
preserve
my
own
life
if
i
were
alone
but
surrounded
by
my
family
that
would
be
impossible
we
should
all
fall
victims
together
my
duty
plainly
is
to
send
you
to
a
place
of
safety
an
opportunity
for
doing
this
soon
occurred
paquette
the
interpreter
who
was
likewise
an
agent
of
the
american
fur
company
had
occasion
to
send
a
of
furs
to
green
bay
on
their
way
to
mackinac
kinzie
having
seen
it
as
comfortably
fitted
up
as
an
open
boat
of
that
description
could
be
with
a
fastened
on
a
of
over
the
centre
and
lined
with
a
blanket
and
having
placed
on
board
an
abundant
store
of
provisions
and
other
comforts
committed
us
to
the
joint
care
of
my
brother
arthur
and
our
faithful
blacksmith
mâtâ
this
latter
was
a
tall
gaunt
frenchman
with
a
freckled
face
a
profusion
of
crisp
sandy
hair
and
an
inveterate
propensity
to
speak
english
his
knowledge
of
the
language
was
somewhat
limited
and
he
burlesqued
it
by
adding
an
s
to
almost
every
word
and
giving
out
each
phrase
with
a
jerk
davids
he
was
wont
to
say
to
the
little
yellow
fiddler
after
an
evening
frolic
at
the
interpreter
davids
clear
away
the
tables
and
the
glasses
and
play
he
was
a
kind
affectionate
creature
and
his
devotion
to
monsieur
johns
and
madame
johns
knew
no
bounds
besides
these
two
protectors
three
trusty
indians
the
chief
of
whom
was
called
were
engaged
to
escort
our
party
the
crew
of
the
boat
consisted
entirely
of
french
engagés
in
the
service
of
the
fur
company
they
were
six
merry
fellows
lightening
their
labor
with
their
pipe
and
their
songs
in
which
latter
they
would
have
esteemed
it
a
great
compliment
to
be
joined
by
the
ladies
who
listened
to
them
but
our
hearts
alas
were
now
too
heavy
to
participate
in
their
enjoyment
the
fourth
of
july
the
day
on
which
we
left
our
home
was
a
gloomy
one
indeed
to
those
who
departed
and
to
the
one
left
behind
who
knew
if
we
should
ever
meet
again
the
experience
which
some
of
the
circle
had
had
in
indian
warfare
was
such
as
to
justify
the
saddest
forebodings
there
was
not
even
the
consolation
of
a
certainty
that
this
step
would
secure
our
safety
the
sauks
might
possibly
be
on
the
other
side
of
us
and
the
route
we
were
taking
might
perhaps
though
not
probably
carry
us
into
their
very
midst
it
was
no
wonder
then
that
our
was
a
solemn
one
a
parting
which
all
felt
might
be
for
this
world
not
however
for
the
gay
cheerful
frenchmen
laughed
and
sang
and
cracked
their
jokes
and
assured
monsieur
john
that
they
would
take
madame
john
and
madame
alum
safe
to
the
bay
spite
of
sauks
or
wind
or
weather
thus
we
set
out
on
our
journey
for
many
miles
the
fort
was
in
sight
as
the
course
of
the
river
alternately
approached
and
receded
from
its
walls
and
it
was
not
until
nearly
that
we
caught
the
last
glimpse
of
our
home
at
the
meal
or
pipe
of
the
voyageurs
an
alarming
discovery
was
made
no
bread
had
been
put
on
board
for
the
crew
how
this
oversight
had
occurred
no
one
could
tell
one
was
certain
that
a
large
quantity
had
been
brought
from
the
for
their
use
that
very
morning
another
had
even
seen
the
sacks
of
loaves
standing
in
paquette
kitchen
be
that
as
it
may
there
we
were
many
miles
on
our
journey
and
with
no
provisions
for
the
six
frenchmen
except
some
salted
pork
a
few
beans
and
some
onions
a
consultation
was
held
in
this
emergency
should
they
return
to
the
portage
for
supplies
the
same
danger
that
made
their
departure
necessary
still
existed
and
the
utmost
dispatch
had
been
enjoined
upon
them
we
found
upon
examination
that
the
store
of
bread
and
crackers
with
which
our
party
had
been
provided
was
what
we
could
possibly
require
and
we
thought
it
would
be
sufficient
to
allow
of
rations
to
the
frenchmen
until
we
should
reach
powell
at
the
butte
des
morts
the
day
but
one
following
where
we
should
undoubtedly
be
able
to
procure
a
fresh
supply
this
decided
on
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
always
in
profound
silence
for
a
song
or
a
loud
laugh
was
now
strictly
prohibited
until
we
should
have
passed
the
utmost
limits
of
country
where
the
enemy
might
possibly
be
we
had
been
warned
beforehand
that
a
certain
point
where
the
low
marshy
meadows
through
which
the
river
had
hitherto
run
rises
into
a
more
firm
and
elevated
country
was
the
border
of
the
menomonee
territory
and
the
spot
where
the
sauks
if
they
had
fled
north
of
the
wisconsin
towards
the
chippewa
country
would
be
most
likely
to
be
encountered
as
we
received
intimation
on
the
forenoon
of
the
second
day
that
we
were
drawing
near
this
spot
i
must
confess
that
we
held
our
breath
for
awe
the
three
winnebagoes
were
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
old
smoker
the
chief
squatted
upon
his
feet
on
the
bench
of
the
foremost
rowers
we
looked
at
him
he
was
gazing
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
wooded
point
we
were
approaching
our
eyes
followed
his
and
we
saw
three
indians
step
forward
and
stand
upon
the
bank
we
said
in
a
low
voice
to
each
other
if
they
are
sauks
we
are
lost
for
the
whole
body
must
be
in
that
thicket
the
boat
continued
to
approach
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
dip
of
the
paddle
and
perhaps
the
beating
hearts
of
some
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
stillness
again
we
looked
at
the
chief
his
nostrils
were
dilated
his
eyes
almost
glaring
suddenly
with
a
bound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
uttered
his
long
shrill
whoop
hoh
hoh
hoh
neechee
friend
all
was
now
joy
and
gladness
every
one
was
forward
to
shake
hands
with
the
strangers
as
soon
as
we
could
reach
them
in
token
of
our
satisfaction
that
they
were
menomonees
and
not
sauks
of
the
latter
of
whom
by
the
way
they
could
give
us
no
intelligence
by
noon
of
that
day
we
considered
ourselves
to
be
out
of
the
region
of
danger
still
caution
was
deemed
necessary
and
when
at
the
pipe
the
boat
was
pushed
ashore
under
a
beautiful
overhanging
bank
crowned
with
a
thick
wood
the
usual
vigilance
was
somewhat
relaxed
and
the
young
people
under
the
escort
of
arthur
and
mâtâ
were
permitted
to
roam
about
a
little
in
the
vicinity
of
the
boat
they
soon
came
back
with
the
report
that
the
woods
were
alive
with
pigeons
they
could
almost
knock
them
down
with
sticks
and
earnestly
did
they
plead
to
be
allowed
to
shoot
at
least
enough
for
supper
but
no
the
enemy
might
be
nearer
than
we
imagined
the
firing
of
a
gun
would
betray
our
whereabouts
it
was
most
prudent
to
give
no
notice
to
friend
or
foe
so
very
reluctantly
they
were
compelled
to
return
to
the
boat
without
their
game
the
next
morning
brought
us
to
powell
at
the
butte
des
morts
sad
were
the
faces
of
the
poor
frenchmen
at
learning
that
not
a
loaf
of
bread
was
to
be
had
our
own
store
too
was
by
this
time
quite
exhausted
the
only
substitute
we
could
obtain
was
a
bag
of
dark
looking
bitter
flour
with
this
provision
for
our
whole
party
we
were
forced
to
be
contented
and
we
left
the
hillock
of
the
dead
feeling
that
it
had
been
indeed
the
grave
of
our
hopes
by
dint
of
good
rowing
our
crew
soon
brought
us
to
the
spot
where
the
river
enters
that
beautiful
sheet
of
water
winnebago
lake
though
there
was
but
little
wind
when
we
reached
the
lake
the
frenchmen
hoisted
their
sail
in
hopes
to
save
themselves
the
labor
of
rowing
across
but
in
vain
did
they
whistle
with
all
the
force
of
their
lungs
in
vain
did
they
supplicate
with
a
comical
mixture
of
fun
and
reverence
as
a
last
resource
it
was
at
length
suggested
by
some
one
that
their
only
chance
lay
in
propitiating
the
goddess
of
the
winds
with
an
offering
of
some
garment
application
was
made
all
round
by
guardapié
the
chief
spokesman
of
the
crew
alas
not
one
of
the
poor
voyageurs
could
boast
a
spare
article
a
few
old
rags
were
at
length
rummaged
out
of
the
little
receptacle
of
food
clothing
and
dirt
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
cast
into
the
waves
for
a
moment
all
flattered
themselves
that
the
experiment
had
been
successful
the
sail
fluttered
swelled
a
little
and
then
flapped
idly
down
against
the
mast
the
party
were
in
despair
until
after
a
whispered
consultation
together
julian
and
edwin
stepped
forward
as
messengers
of
mercy
in
a
trice
they
divested
themselves
of
jacket
and
vest
and
made
a
proffer
of
their
next
garment
to
aid
in
raising
the
wind
at
first
there
seemed
a
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
boatmen
whether
they
ought
to
accept
so
magnificent
an
offer
but
finding
on
giving
them
a
preparatory
shake
that
the
value
of
the
contribution
was
less
than
they
had
imagined
they
with
many
shouts
and
much
laughter
consigned
them
to
the
waves
to
the
great
delight
and
astonishment
of
the
boys
a
breeze
at
this
moment
sprang
up
which
carried
the
little
vessel
beautifully
over
the
waters
for
about
half
the
distance
to
garlic
island
by
this
time
the
charm
was
exhausted
nor
was
it
found
possible
to
renew
it
by
a
repetition
of
similar
offerings
all
expedients
were
tried
without
success
and
with
sundry
rather
disrespectful
reflections
upon
the
lady
whose
aid
they
had
invoked
the
frenchmen
were
compelled
to
betake
themselves
to
their
oars
until
they
reached
the
island
two
or
three
canoes
of
winnebagoes
arrived
at
the
same
moment
and
their
owners
immediately
stepped
forward
with
an
offering
of
some
sturgeon
which
they
had
caught
in
the
lake
as
this
promised
to
be
an
agreeable
variety
to
the
meal
at
least
for
the
frenchmen
it
was
decided
to
stop
and
kindle
a
fire
for
the
purpose
of
cooking
it
we
took
advantage
of
this
interval
to
recommend
to
the
boys
a
stroll
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
where
the
clear
shallow
water
and
pebbly
beach
offered
temptation
to
a
refreshing
bath
while
they
availed
themselves
of
this
under
the
supervision
of
harry
the
black
boy
we
amused
ourselves
with
gathering
the
fine
red
raspberries
with
which
the
island
abounded
our
enjoyment
was
cut
short
however
by
discovering
that
the
whole
place
vines
shrubs
and
even
apparently
the
earth
itself
was
infested
with
myriads
of
the
a
little
insect
that
having
fastened
to
the
skin
penetrates
into
the
very
flesh
causing
a
swelling
and
irritation
exceeding
painful
and
even
dangerous
the
alarm
was
sounded
to
bring
the
boys
back
in
all
haste
to
the
open
and
more
frequented
part
of
the
island
but
we
soon
found
we
had
not
left
our
tormentors
behind
throughout
the
day
we
continued
to
be
sensible
of
their
proximity
from
the
effects
of
their
attacks
we
were
not
relieved
for
several
succeeding
days
those
which
had
succeeded
in
burying
themselves
in
the
flesh
having
to
be
removed
with
the
point
of
a
penknife
or
a
large
needle
after
partaking
of
our
dinner
we
stepped
on
board
our
boat
and
the
wind
having
risen
we
were
carried
by
the
breeze
to
the
farther
verge
of
the
lake
and
into
the
entrance
of
the
river
or
as
it
was
called
the
winnebago
rapids
on
the
point
of
land
to
the
right
stood
a
collection
of
neat
bark
wigwams
this
was
village
it
was
an
exciting
and
somewhat
hazardous
passage
down
the
rapids
and
over
the
grand
chûte
a
fall
of
several
feet
but
it
was
safely
passed
and
at
the
approach
of
evening
the
boat
reached
the
settlement
of
the
waubanakees
at
the
head
of
the
little
chûte
these
are
the
stockbridge
or
brothertown
indians
the
remains
of
the
old
mohicans
who
had
a
few
years
before
emigrated
from
oneida
county
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
a
tract
granted
them
by
the
united
states
on
the
fertile
banks
of
the
fox
river
they
had
already
cleared
extensive
openings
in
the
forest
and
built
some
substantial
and
comfortable
houses
near
the
banks
of
the
river
which
were
here
quite
high
and
covered
for
the
most
part
with
gigantic
trees
it
was
determined
to
ask
hospitality
of
these
people
to
the
extent
of
borrowing
a
corner
of
their
fire
to
boil
our
and
bake
the
which
had
been
now
for
nearly
two
days
our
substitute
for
bread
its
manufacture
had
been
a
subject
of
much
merriment
the
ingredients
consisting
of
powell
black
flour
some
salt
and
a
little
butter
were
mixed
in
the
tin
box
which
had
held
our
meat
this
was
then
reversed
and
having
been
properly
cleansed
supplied
the
place
of
a
the
served
the
office
of
and
a
shallow
tin
dish
formed
the
appliance
for
baking
the
waubanakees
were
so
good
as
to
lend
us
an
iron
and
superintend
the
cooking
of
our
cake
after
harry
had
carried
it
up
to
their
dwelling
so
kind
and
hospitable
did
they
show
themselves
that
the
crew
of
the
boat
took
the
resolution
of
asking
a
lodging
on
shore
by
way
of
relief
after
their
crowded
quarters
in
the
boat
for
the
last
three
nights
arthur
and
mâtâ
soon
adopted
the
same
idea
and
we
were
invited
to
follow
their
example
with
the
assurance
that
the
houses
were
extremely
neat
and
orderly
we
preferred
however
as
it
was
a
fine
night
and
all
things
were
so
comfortably
arranged
in
the
boat
to
remain
on
board
keeping
edwin
and
josette
with
us
the
boat
was
tightly
moored
for
the
little
chûte
was
just
below
and
if
our
craft
should
break
loose
in
the
rapid
current
and
drift
down
over
the
falls
it
would
be
a
very
serious
matter
as
an
additional
precaution
one
man
was
left
on
board
to
keep
all
things
safe
and
in
order
and
these
arrangements
having
been
made
the
others
ascended
the
bank
and
took
up
their
night
lodgings
in
the
waubanakee
cabins
it
was
a
beautiful
calm
moonlight
night
the
air
just
sufficiently
warm
to
be
agreeable
while
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
rapids
and
of
the
fall
at
no
great
distance
soon
lulled
our
party
to
repose
how
long
we
had
slumbered
we
knew
not
when
we
were
aroused
by
a
rushing
wind
it
bent
the
poles
supporting
the
awning
snapped
them
and
another
gust
succeeding
tent
and
blanket
were
carried
away
on
the
blast
down
the
stream
the
moonlight
was
gone
but
a
flash
of
lightning
showed
them
sailing
away
like
a
spectre
in
the
distance
the
storm
increased
in
violence
the
rain
began
to
pour
in
torrents
and
the
thunder
and
lightning
to
succeed
each
other
in
fearful
rapidity
my
sister
sprang
to
waken
the
frenchman
get
up
vitelle
quick
cried
she
in
french
run
up
the
bank
for
mâtâ
and
arthur
tell
them
to
come
and
get
us
instantly
the
man
made
her
no
reply
but
fell
upon
his
knees
invoking
the
virgin
most
vociferously
do
not
wait
for
the
virgin
but
go
as
quickly
as
possible
do
you
not
see
we
shall
all
be
killed
oh
not
for
the
world
madame
not
for
the
world
said
vitelle
burying
his
head
in
a
pack
of
furs
would
i
go
up
that
bank
in
this
storm
and
here
he
began
crying
most
lustily
to
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
it
was
indeed
awful
the
roaring
of
the
thunder
and
the
flashing
of
the
lightning
around
us
were
like
the
continued
discharge
of
a
park
of
artillery
i
with
some
difficulty
drew
forth
my
cloak
and
enveloped
myself
and
josette
sister
margaret
did
the
same
with
edwin
oh
i
madame
said
the
poor
little
girl
her
teeth
chattering
with
cold
and
fright
wo
we
be
drowned
very
well
said
my
sister
to
the
frenchman
you
see
that
madame
john
is
at
the
last
agony
if
you
will
not
go
for
help
i
must
and
monsieur
john
must
know
that
you
left
his
wife
to
perish
this
was
too
much
for
vitelle
if
i
must
i
must
said
he
and
with
a
desperate
bound
he
leaped
on
shore
and
sped
up
the
hill
with
might
and
main
in
a
few
minutes
though
it
seemed
ages
to
us
a
whole
posse
came
flying
down
the
hill
the
incessant
lightning
made
all
things
appear
as
in
the
glare
of
day
mâtâ
curly
hair
fairly
stood
on
end
and
his
eyes
rolled
with
ghastly
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
oh
my
god
madame
johns
what
would
monsieur
johns
say
to
see
you
nows
exclaimed
he
as
he
seized
me
in
his
arms
and
bore
me
up
the
hill
arthur
followed
with
sister
margaret
and
two
others
with
edwin
and
josette
nobody
carried
vitelle
for
he
had
taken
care
not
to
risk
his
precious
life
by
venturing
again
to
the
boat
on
arriving
at
the
cabin
where
arthur
and
mâtâ
had
been
lodged
a
fire
was
with
some
difficulty
kindled
and
our
trunks
having
been
brought
up
from
the
boat
we
were
at
length
able
to
exchange
our
drenched
garments
and
those
of
the
children
for
others
more
comfortable
after
which
we
laid
ourselves
upon
the
clean
but
homely
bed
and
slept
until
daylight
as
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
what
degree
of
damage
the
cargo
of
furs
had
sustained
an
early
start
was
proposed
apparently
the
inhabitants
of
the
cottages
had
become
weary
in
for
they
declined
preparing
breakfast
for
us
although
we
assured
them
they
should
be
well
compensated
for
their
trouble
we
consequently
saw
ourselves
compelled
to
depart
with
very
slender
prospects
of
a
morning
meal
when
we
reached
the
boat
what
a
scene
presented
itself
bedclothes
cloaks
trunks
packs
of
furs
all
bearing
the
marks
of
a
complete
deluge
the
boat
in
water
literally
no
place
on
board
where
we
could
either
stand
or
sit
after
some
bailing
out
and
an
attempt
at
disposing
some
of
the
packs
of
furs
which
had
suffered
least
from
the
flood
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
divan
in
the
centre
of
the
boat
nothing
better
seemed
to
offer
than
to
and
endure
what
could
not
be
cured
our
position
was
not
an
enviable
one
wherever
a
foot
or
hand
was
placed
the
water
gushed
up
with
a
bubbling
sound
and
oh
the
state
of
the
bandboxes
and
breakfast
there
was
none
for
on
examining
the
everything
it
contained
was
found
mingled
in
one
undistinguishable
mass
tea
pepper
salt
all
floating
together
it
was
a
hopeless
case
but
this
was
not
the
worst
as
the
fervid
july
sun
rose
higher
in
the
heavens
the
steam
which
exhaled
from
every
object
on
board
was
nearly
suffocating
the
boat
was
old
the
packs
of
skins
were
old
their
vicinity
in
a
dry
day
had
been
anything
but
agreeable
now
it
was
intolerable
there
was
no
retreating
from
it
however
so
we
encouraged
the
children
to
arm
themselves
with
patience
for
the
short
time
that
yet
remained
of
our
voyage
seated
on
our
odoriferous
couch
beneath
the
shade
of
a
single
umbrella
to
protect
our
whole
party
from
the
scorching
sun
we
glided
wearily
down
the
stream
through
that
long
tedious
day
as
we
passed
successively
the
kakalin
the
rapids
dickenson
the
agency
with
what
longing
eyes
did
we
gaze
at
human
habitations
where
others
were
enjoying
the
shelter
of
a
roof
and
the
comforts
of
food
and
how
eagerly
did
we
count
the
hours
which
must
elapse
before
we
could
reach
port
howard
there
were
no
songs
from
the
poor
frenchmen
this
day
music
and
fasting
do
not
go
well
together
at
length
we
stopped
at
where
the
boat
was
to
be
unloaded
all
hands
fell
to
work
to
transfer
the
cargo
to
the
warehouse
of
the
fur
company
which
stood
near
the
landing
it
was
not
a
long
operation
for
all
worked
heartily
this
being
accomplished
the
voyageurs
one
and
all
prepared
to
take
their
leave
in
vain
mâtâ
stormed
and
raved
in
vain
arthur
remonstrated
no
they
said
they
had
brought
the
boat
and
cargo
to
the
warehouse
that
was
all
of
their
job
and
they
turned
to
go
guardapié
said
i
do
you
intend
to
leave
us
here
bien
madame
it
is
the
place
we
always
stop
at
does
monsieur
john
pay
you
for
bringing
his
family
down
oh
yes
monsieur
john
has
given
us
an
order
on
the
sutler
at
the
fort
down
below
to
be
paid
when
you
deliver
us
safe
at
the
fort
down
below
it
seems
i
shall
be
there
before
you
and
i
shall
arrange
that
matter
monsieur
john
never
dreamed
that
this
would
be
your
conduct
the
frenchmen
consulted
together
and
the
result
was
that
guardapié
with
two
others
jumped
into
the
boat
took
their
oars
and
rather
sulkily
rowed
us
the
remaining
two
miles
to
fort
howard
chapter
xxxiv
fort
howard
our
return
home
we
soon
learned
that
a
great
panic
prevailed
at
green
bay
on
account
of
the
sauks
the
people
seemed
to
have
possessed
themselves
with
the
idea
that
the
enemy
would
visit
this
place
on
their
way
to
canada
to
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
british
government
how
they
were
to
get
there
from
this
point
whether
they
were
to
stop
and
fabricate
themselves
bark
canoes
for
the
purpose
or
whether
they
were
to
charter
one
of
newbery
schooners
for
the
trip
the
good
people
did
not
seem
fully
to
have
made
up
their
minds
one
thing
is
certain
a
portion
of
the
citizens
were
nearly
frightened
to
death
and
were
fully
convinced
that
there
was
no
safety
for
them
but
within
the
walls
of
the
old
dilapidated
fort
from
which
nearly
all
the
troops
had
been
withdrawn
and
sent
to
fort
winnebago
some
time
previous
their
fears
were
greatly
aggravated
by
a
report
brought
by
some
traveller
that
he
had
slept
at
night
on
the
very
spot
where
the
sauks
breakfasted
the
next
morning
now
as
the
sauks
were
known
to
be
reduced
to
very
short
commons
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
if
the
man
had
waited
half
an
hour
longer
they
would
have
eaten
him
so
he
was
considered
to
have
made
a
wonderful
escape
our
immediate
friends
and
acquaintances
were
far
from
joining
in
these
fears
the
utter
improbability
of
such
a
movement
was
obvious
to
all
who
considered
the
nature
of
the
country
to
be
traversed
and
the
efficient
and
numerous
body
of
whites
by
whom
they
must
be
opposed
on
their
entrance
into
that
neighborhood
there
were
some
however
who
could
not
be
persuaded
that
there
was
any
security
but
in
flight
and
eagerly
was
the
arrival
of
the
mariner
looked
for
as
the
anxiety
grew
more
and
more
intense
the
mariner
appeared
at
last
it
was
early
in
the
morning
in
one
hour
from
the
time
of
her
arrival
the
fearful
news
she
brought
had
spread
the
whole
length
of
the
settlement
the
cholera
was
in
this
country
it
was
in
detroit
it
was
among
the
troops
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
seat
of
war
whole
companies
had
died
of
it
in
the
river
clair
and
the
survivors
had
been
put
on
shore
at
port
gratiot
to
save
their
lives
as
best
they
might
we
were
shut
in
between
the
savage
foe
on
one
hand
and
the
pestilence
on
the
other
to
those
who
had
friends
at
the
east
the
news
was
most
appalling
it
seemed
to
unman
every
one
who
heard
it
an
officer
who
had
exhibited
the
most
distinguished
prowess
in
the
and
also
in
some
private
enterprises
demanding
unequalled
courage
and
daring
was
the
first
to
bring
us
the
news
when
he
had
communicated
it
he
laid
his
head
against
the
and
wept
like
a
child
those
who
must
perforce
rejoin
friends
near
and
dear
left
the
bay
in
the
mariner
all
others
considered
their
present
home
the
safest
and
so
it
proved
for
the
dreadful
scourge
did
not
visit
green
bay
that
season
the
weather
was
intensely
hot
and
the
mosquitoes
so
thick
that
we
did
not
pretend
to
walk
on
the
parade
after
sunset
unless
armed
with
two
fans
or
green
branches
to
keep
constantly
in
motion
in
order
to
disperse
them
this
by
the
way
was
the
surest
method
of
attracting
them
we
had
somehow
forgotten
the
apathetic
indifference
which
had
often
excited
our
wonder
in
old
smoker
as
we
had
observed
him
calmly
sitting
and
allowing
his
naked
arms
and
person
to
become
literally
with
the
tormenting
insects
then
he
would
quietly
wipe
off
a
handful
the
blood
following
the
movement
of
the
hand
over
his
skin
and
stoically
wait
for
an
occasion
to
repeat
the
movement
it
is
said
that
the
mosquito
if
undisturbed
until
he
has
taken
his
fill
leaves
a
much
less
inflamed
bite
than
if
brushed
away
in
the
midst
of
his
feast
by
day
the
air
was
at
this
season
filled
with
what
is
called
the
green
bay
fly
a
species
of
with
which
the
outer
walls
of
the
houses
are
at
times
so
covered
that
their
color
is
hardly
distinguishable
their
existence
is
very
ephemeral
scarcely
lasting
more
than
a
day
their
dead
bodies
are
seen
adhering
to
the
walls
and
windows
within
and
they
fall
without
in
such
numbers
that
after
a
high
wind
has
gathered
them
into
rows
along
the
sides
of
the
quarters
one
may
walk
through
them
and
toss
them
up
with
their
feet
like
the
dry
leaves
in
autumn
as
we
walked
across
the
parade
our
attention
was
sometimes
called
to
a
tapping
upon
the
bars
of
the
dungeon
in
which
a
criminal
was
confined
it
was
the
murderer
of
lieutenant
foster
it
may
be
remembered
that
this
amiable
young
officer
had
been
our
travelling
companion
in
our
journey
from
chicago
the
preceding
year
some
months
after
his
arrival
at
port
howard
he
had
occasion
to
order
a
soldier
of
his
company
named
doyle
into
confinement
for
intoxication
the
man
a
few
days
afterwards
prevailed
on
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
to
escort
him
to
lieutenant
foster
quarters
on
the
plea
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
him
he
ascended
the
stairs
to
the
young
officer
room
while
the
sergeant
and
another
soldier
remained
at
the
foot
near
the
door
doyle
entered
and
addressing
lieutenant
foster
said
will
you
please
tell
me
lieutenant
what
i
am
confined
for
no
sir
replied
the
officer
you
know
your
offence
well
enough
return
to
your
place
of
confinement
the
man
ran
wrenched
the
gun
from
the
sergeant
hand
and
rushing
back
discharged
it
at
the
heart
of
lieutenant
foster
he
turned
to
go
to
his
inner
apartment
but
exclaiming
ah
me
he
fell
dead
before
the
entrance
doyle
having
been
tried
by
a
civil
court
was
now
under
sentence
awaiting
his
execution
he
was
a
hardened
villain
never
exhibiting
the
slightest
compunction
for
his
crime
the
commanding
officer
major
clark
sent
to
him
one
day
to
inquire
if
he
wanted
anything
for
his
comfort
if
the
major
pleased
he
replied
he
should
like
to
have
a
light
and
a
copy
of
byron
works
some
fears
were
entertained
that
he
would
contrive
to
make
way
with
himself
before
the
day
of
execution
and
to
guard
against
it
he
was
deprived
of
everything
that
could
furnish
him
a
weapon
his
food
was
served
to
him
in
a
wooden
bowl
lest
a
bit
of
broken
crockery
might
he
used
as
a
means
of
self
destruction
one
morning
he
sent
a
little
package
to
the
commanding
officer
as
a
present
it
contained
a
strong
rope
fabricated
from
strips
of
his
blanket
that
he
had
carefully
separated
and
with
a
large
stout
spike
at
the
end
of
it
the
message
accompanying
it
was
he
wished
major
clark
to
see
that
if
he
chose
to
put
an
end
to
himself
he
could
find
means
to
do
it
in
spite
of
him
and
this
hardened
frame
of
mind
continued
to
the
last
when
he
was
led
out
for
execution
in
passing
beyond
the
gate
he
observed
a
quantity
of
lumber
recently
collected
for
the
construction
of
a
new
warehouse
ah
captain
what
are
you
going
to
build
here
inquired
he
of
captain
scott
who
attended
him
doyle
replied
his
captain
you
have
but
a
few
moments
to
live
you
had
better
employ
your
thoughts
about
something
else
it
is
for
that
very
reason
captain
said
he
that
i
am
inquiring
as
my
time
is
short
i
wish
to
gain
all
the
information
i
can
while
it
lasts
we
were
not
suffered
to
remain
long
in
suspense
in
regard
to
the
friends
we
had
left
behind
in
less
than
two
weeks
old
smoker
again
made
his
appearance
he
was
the
bearer
of
letters
from
my
husband
informing
me
that
general
dodge
was
then
with
him
at
port
winnebago
that
generals
henry
and
alexander
were
likewise
at
the
fort
and
that
as
soon
as
they
had
recruited
their
men
and
horses
which
were
pretty
well
worn
out
with
scouring
the
country
after
black
hawk
they
would
march
again
in
pursuit
of
him
towards
the
of
the
rock
river
where
they
had
every
reason
from
information
lately
brought
in
by
the
winnebagoes
to
believe
he
would
be
found
as
he
charged
us
to
lay
aside
all
uneasiness
on
his
account
and
moreover
held
forth
the
hope
of
soon
coming
or
sending
for
us
our
minds
became
more
tranquil
not
long
after
this
i
was
told
one
morning
that
wished
to
see
me
at
the
front
door
i
obeyed
the
summons
and
to
my
surprise
was
greeted
by
my
friend
after
much
demonstration
of
joy
at
seeing
me
such
as
putting
her
two
hands
together
over
her
forehead
and
then
parting
them
in
a
waving
kind
of
gesture
laughing
and
patting
me
on
my
arms
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
letter
from
my
husband
of
which
she
was
the
bearer
it
was
to
this
effect
generals
dodge
and
henry
left
here
a
few
days
since
accompanied
by
paquette
they
met
the
sauks
near
the
wisconsin
on
the
a
battle
ensued
in
which
upwards
of
fifty
of
the
enemy
were
killed
our
loss
was
one
killed
and
eight
wounded
the
are
well
pleased
that
all
this
has
been
accomplished
without
any
aid
from
white
the
war
must
be
near
its
close
for
the
militia
and
regulars
together
will
soon
finish
the
remaining
handful
of
fugitives
the
arrival
of
lieutenant
hunter
who
had
obtained
leave
of
absence
in
order
to
escort
us
soon
put
all
things
in
train
for
our
return
to
fort
winnebago
no
mackinac
boat
was
to
be
had
but
in
lieu
of
it
a
durham
boat
was
procured
this
is
of
a
description
longer
and
shallower
than
the
other
with
no
convenience
for
rigging
up
an
awning
or
shelter
of
any
kind
over
the
centre
but
its
size
was
better
fitted
to
accommodate
our
party
which
consisted
besides
our
own
family
of
lieutenant
and
hunter
the
wife
of
another
officer
now
stationed
at
port
winnebago
and
our
cousin
miss
forsyth
we
made
up
our
minds
as
will
be
supposed
to
pretty
close
quarters
our
crew
was
composed
partly
of
frenchmen
and
partly
of
soldiers
and
all
things
being
in
readiness
we
set
off
one
fine
bright
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
july
our
second
day
alternate
rowing
and
poling
brought
us
to
the
grande
chûte
early
in
the
afternoon
here
it
is
the
custom
to
disembark
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
and
ascending
the
high
bank
walk
around
the
fall
while
the
men
pull
the
boat
up
through
the
foaming
waters
most
of
our
party
had
already
stepped
on
shore
when
a
sudden
thought
seized
one
of
the
ladies
and
myself
let
us
stay
in
the
boat
said
we
and
be
pulled
up
the
chûte
the
rest
of
the
company
went
on
while
we
sat
and
watched
with
great
interest
the
preparations
the
men
were
making
they
were
soon
overboard
in
the
water
and
attaching
a
strong
rope
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
all
lent
their
aid
in
pulling
as
they
marched
slowly
along
with
their
heavy
load
the
cargo
consisting
only
of
our
trunks
and
stores
which
were
of
no
very
considerable
weight
had
not
been
removed
we
went
on
now
and
then
getting
a
tremendous
bump
against
a
hidden
rock
and
frequently
splashed
by
a
shower
of
foam
as
the
waves
roared
and
boiled
around
us
the
men
kept
as
close
as
possible
to
the
high
precipitous
bank
where
the
water
was
smoothest
at
the
head
of
the
was
a
merry
simpleton
of
a
frenchman
who
was
constantly
turning
his
head
to
grin
with
delight
at
our
evident
enjoyment
and
excitement
we
were
indeed
in
high
glee
is
not
this
charming
cried
one
i
only
wish
the
wish
whatever
it
was
was
cut
short
by
a
shout
and
a
crash
have
a
care
robineau
mind
where
you
are
taking
the
boat
was
the
cry
but
it
came
too
late
more
occupied
with
the
ladies
than
with
his
duty
the
leader
had
guided
us
into
the
midst
of
a
sharp
projecting
tree
that
hung
from
the
bank
the
first
tug
ripped
out
the
side
of
the
boat
which
immediately
began
to
fill
with
water
my
companion
and
i
jumped
upon
the
nearest
rocks
that
showed
their
heads
above
the
foam
our
screams
and
the
shouts
of
the
men
brought
lieutenant
hunter
and
some
indians
who
were
above
on
the
bank
dashing
down
to
our
rescue
they
carried
us
in
their
arms
to
land
while
the
men
worked
lustily
at
fishing
up
the
contents
of
the
boat
now
thoroughly
saturated
with
water
we
scrambled
up
the
high
bank
in
a
miserable
plight
to
join
in
the
general
lamentation
over
the
probable
consequences
of
the
accident
oh
my
husband
new
uniform
cried
one
and
oh
the
miniatures
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
sighed
another
while
oh
the
silk
dresses
and
the
ribbons
and
the
finery
formed
the
general
chorus
no
one
thought
of
the
provisions
although
we
had
observed
in
our
progress
to
shore
the
barrel
of
bread
and
the
tub
of
ice
which
lieutenant
hunter
had
providently
brought
for
our
refreshment
sailing
away
on
the
dancing
waves
among
the
boxes
brought
to
land
and
toted
up
the
steep
bank
was
one
containing
some
loaves
of
sugar
and
packages
of
tea
which
i
had
bought
for
our
winter
supply
from
the
sutler
at
the
post
the
young
indian
who
was
the
bearer
of
it
set
it
upon
the
ground
and
soon
called
my
attention
to
a
thick
white
stream
that
was
oozing
from
the
corners
i
made
signs
for
him
to
taste
it
he
dipped
his
finger
in
it
and
exclaimed
with
delight
to
his
companions
when
he
perceived
what
it
was
i
then
pointed
to
his
hatchet
and
motioned
him
to
open
the
box
he
did
not
require
a
second
invitation
it
was
soon
backed
to
pieces
then
as
i
beckoned
up
all
the
rest
of
the
youngsters
who
were
looking
on
full
of
wonder
such
a
scrambling
and
shouting
with
delight
succeeded
as
put
us
all
particularly
the
boys
into
fits
of
laughter
bowls
dippers
hands
everything
that
could
contain
even
the
smallest
quantity
were
put
in
requisition
the
squaws
were
most
active
those
who
could
do
no
better
took
the
stoutest
fragments
of
the
blue
paper
in
which
the
sugar
had
been
enveloped
and
in
a
trice
nothing
remained
but
the
wet
yellow
bundles
of
tea
and
the
fragments
of
the
splintered
box
which
had
contained
it
by
this
time
fires
had
been
made
and
the
articles
from
the
trunks
were
soon
seen
covering
every
shrub
and
bush
in
the
vicinity
fortunately
the
box
containing
the
new
uniform
had
been
piled
high
above
the
others
in
the
centre
of
the
boat
and
had
received
but
little
damage
but
sad
was
the
condition
of
the
wardrobes
in
general
not
a
white
article
was
to
be
seen
all
was
mottled
blue
green
red
and
black
intermingling
in
streaks
and
dripping
from
ends
and
corners
to
add
to
the
trouble
the
rain
began
to
fall
as
rain
is
apt
to
do
at
an
inconvenient
moment
and
soon
the
garments
had
to
be
gathered
out
of
the
smoke
and
huddled
away
in
a
most
discouraging
condition
the
tent
was
pitched
wet
as
it
was
and
the
blankets
wrung
out
of
the
water
and
partially
dried
were
spread
upon
the
ground
for
our
accommodation
at
night
a
hamburg
cheese
which
had
been
a
part
of
my
stores
was
voted
to
me
for
a
pillow
and
after
a
supper
the
best
part
of
which
was
a
portion
of
one
of
the
wet
loaves
which
had
remained
in
a
barrel
too
tightly
wedged
to
drift
away
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
repose
the
next
morning
rose
hot
and
sultry
the
mosquitoes
which
the
rain
had
kept
at
bay
through
the
night
now
began
to
make
themselves
amends
and
to
torment
us
unmercifully
after
our
most
uncomfortable
and
unpalatable
breakfast
the
first
question
for
consideration
was
what
we
were
to
do
with
ourselves
our
boat
lay
submerged
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
up
the
rapids
the
nearest
habitation
among
the
waubanakees
was
some
miles
distant
and
this
there
was
no
means
of
reaching
but
by
an
indian
canoe
if
some
of
our
present
friends
and
neighbors
would
be
so
obliging
as
to
bring
one
for
our
use
even
then
it
was
doubtful
if
boats
could
be
found
sufficient
to
convey
all
our
numerous
party
back
to
green
bay
in
the
midst
of
these
perplexing
consultations
a
whoop
was
heard
from
beyond
the
hill
which
here
sloped
away
to
the
north
at
the
head
of
the
rapids
there
is
john
that
is
certainly
his
voice
cried
more
than
one
of
the
company
it
was
indeed
my
husband
and
in
a
moment
he
was
among
us
never
was
arrival
more
opportune
more
evidently
providential
not
having
learned
our
plans
for
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
had
prevented
our
sending
him
word
he
had
come
provided
with
a
boat
to
take
us
back
to
fort
winnebago
our
drying
operations
which
we
had
recommenced
this
morning
were
soon
cut
short
everything
was
shuffled
away
in
the
most
expeditious
manner
possible
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
we
were
transferred
to
the
other
boat
which
lay
quietly
above
the
chûte
and
were
pulling
away
towards
winnebago
lake
we
had
resolved
to
go
only
so
far
as
the
vicinity
of
the
lake
where
the
breeze
would
render
the
mosquitoes
less
intolerable
and
then
to
stop
and
make
one
more
attempt
at
drying
our
clothing
accordingly
when
we
reached
a
beautiful
high
bank
near
the
little
butte
we
stopped
for
that
purpose
again
unpacked
our
trunks
and
soon
every
bush
and
twig
was
fluttering
with
the
spoils
of
the
cruel
waves
hardly
had
we
thus
disposed
of
the
last
rag
or
ribbon
when
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
followed
by
loud
shouts
and
cheers
ringing
through
the
forest
a
company
of
about
horsemen
with
banners
flying
veils
fluttering
from
their
hats
and
arms
glittering
in
the
sun
rode
into
our
midst
and
amid
greetings
and
roars
of
laughter
inquired
into
the
nature
and
reasons
of
our
singular
state
of
confusion
they
were
colonel
stambough
and
alexander
irwin
of
green
bay
with
a
company
of
young
volunteers
and
followed
by
a
whooping
band
of
menomonees
all
bound
for
the
seat
of
war
we
comforted
them
with
the
assurance
that
the
victories
were
by
this
time
all
won
and
the
scalps
taken
but
expressing
the
hope
that
there
were
yet
a
few
laurels
to
be
earned
they
bade
us
adieu
and
rapidly
pursued
their
march
we
crossed
lake
winnebago
by
the
clear
beautiful
light
of
a
summer
moon
the
soft
air
was
just
enough
to
swell
the
sail
and
thus
save
the
men
their
labor
at
the
oar
the
witchery
of
the
hour
was
not
however
sufficient
to
induce
us
to
forego
our
repose
after
the
heat
and
annoyances
of
the
day
we
therefore
disposed
ourselves
betimes
to
be
packed
away
in
the
centre
of
the
boat
how
it
was
accomplished
no
one
of
the
numerous
company
could
tell
if
any
accident
had
occurred
to
disturb
our
arrangement
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
a
chinese
puzzle
to
put
us
back
again
in
our
places
the
men
on
the
outside
had
much
the
best
of
it
and
we
rather
envied
those
who
were
off
watch
their
ability
to
snore
and
change
position
as
the
humor
took
them
we
reached
powell
just
in
time
to
have
gone
ashore
and
prepare
our
breakfast
had
we
had
wherewithal
to
prepare
it
we
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
procure
some
supplies
here
for
hitherto
we
had
been
living
on
the
remains
of
my
husband
ample
stock
that
was
now
so
nearly
exhausted
that
when
we
found
the
could
not
be
replenished
at
this
place
we
began
to
talk
of
putting
ourselves
on
allowance
the
wet
bread
of
which
there
had
remained
an
ample
store
had
as
may
be
readily
imagined
soon
fermented
under
the
influence
of
a
july
sun
the
tea
too
notwithstanding
our
careful
efforts
at
drying
it
on
newspapers
and
pieces
of
board
ere
long
became
musty
and
unfit
for
use
there
was
literally
nothing
left
except
the
salted
meat
and
a
few
crackers
hardly
sufficient
for
the
present
day
the
men
were
therefore
urged
to
make
all
the
speed
possible
that
we
might
reach
gleason
at
lake
puckaway
in
good
season
on
the
following
day
at
evening
when
we
stopped
to
take
our
tea
at
a
beautiful
little
opening
among
the
trees
we
found
our
old
enemies
the
mosquitoes
worse
than
ever
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
our
cloaks
and
gloves
and
tie
our
veils
close
around
our
throats
only
venturing
to
introduce
a
cracker
or
a
cup
of
tea
under
this
protection
in
the
most
stealthy
manner
the
men
rowed
well
and
brought
us
to
gleason
about
eleven
the
next
day
we
were
greeted
with
the
most
enthusiastic
demonstrations
by
my
old
friend
grosse
américaine
who
had
removed
here
from
bellefontaine
oh
armstrong
cried
we
get
us
some
breakfast
we
are
famishing
at
that
instant
who
should
appear
but
our
faithful
mâtâ
driving
the
old
calèche
in
which
we
were
in
the
habit
of
making
our
little
excursions
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
port
he
had
ridden
over
hoping
to
meet
us
in
the
idea
that
some
of
us
would
prefer
this
method
of
reaching
our
home
with
provident
thoughtfulness
he
had
brought
tea
roasted
coffee
fresh
butter
eggs
lest
we
should
be
short
of
such
luxuries
in
that
advanced
stage
of
our
journey
his
madame
johns
how
do
you
dos
was
a
pleasant
and
welcome
sound
we
could
not
wait
for
our
breakfast
but
gathered
round
la
grosse
américaine
like
a
parcel
of
children
while
she
cut
and
spread
slices
of
for
us
after
our
regular
meal
was
finished
it
was
decided
that
sister
margaret
should
take
josette
and
return
with
mâtâ
to
open
the
house
and
make
it
ready
for
our
reception
it
had
been
the
of
militia
indians
and
stragglers
of
various
descriptions
during
our
absence
and
we
could
easily
imagine
that
a
little
misrule
and
unreason
might
have
had
sway
for
that
period
we
had
yet
miles
by
the
devious
winding
course
of
the
river
over
first
the
beautiful
waters
of
lac
de
boeuf
and
then
through
the
low
marshy
lands
that
spread
away
to
the
portage
an
attempt
was
made
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
to
create
a
little
excitement
among
the
ladies
as
we
approached
the
spot
where
it
had
been
supposed
the
sauks
might
pass
on
their
way
to
the
chippewa
country
who
knows
said
he
gravely
but
they
may
be
lurking
in
this
neighborhood
yet
if
so
we
shall
probably
have
some
signal
we
must
be
on
the
alert
some
of
the
ladies
began
to
turn
pale
and
look
about
them
after
an
interval
of
perfect
silence
a
low
prolonged
whistle
was
heard
there
was
so
much
agitation
and
even
actual
terror
that
the
mischievous
author
of
the
trick
was
obliged
to
confess
at
once
and
receive
a
hearty
scolding
for
the
pain
he
had
caused
just
before
sunset
of
the
second
day
from
gleason
we
reached
our
home
every
thing
was
with
neatness
and
good
order
with
the
efficient
aid
of
our
good
manaigre
and
his
wife
the
house
had
been
whitewashed
from
the
roof
to
the
a
thorough
scrubbing
and
cleansing
effected
the
carpets
unpacked
and
spread
upon
the
floors
the
furniture
arranged
and
though
last
not
least
a
noble
supper
smoked
upon
the
board
by
the
time
we
had
made
once
more
a
civilized
toilet
many
of
our
friends
from
the
fort
were
there
to
greet
us
and
a
more
happy
or
thankful
party
has
seldom
been
assembled
chapter
xxxv
surrender
of
winnebago
prisoners
the
war
was
now
considered
at
an
end
the
news
of
the
battle
of
the
bad
axe
where
the
regulars
the
militia
and
the
steamboat
warrior
combined
had
made
a
final
end
of
the
remaining
handful
of
sauks
had
reached
us
and
restored
tranquillity
to
the
hearts
and
homes
of
the
frontier
settlers
it
may
seem
wonderful
that
an
enemy
so
few
in
number
and
so
insignificant
in
resources
could
have
created
such
a
panic
and
required
so
vast
an
amount
of
opposing
force
to
subdue
them
the
difficulty
had
been
simply
in
never
knowing
where
to
find
them
either
to
attack
or
guard
against
them
probably
at
the
outset
every
military
man
thought
and
felt
like
the
noble
old
veteran
general
brady
give
me
two
infantry
companies
mounted
said
he
and
i
will
engage
to
whip
the
sauks
out
of
the
country
in
one
week
true
but
to
whip
the
enemy
you
must
first
meet
him
and
in
order
to
pursue
effectually
and
the
indians
a
peculiar
training
is
necessary
a
training
which
at
that
day
few
even
of
the
frontier
militia
could
boast
in
some
portions
of
this
campaign
there
was
another
difficulty
the
want
of
concert
between
the
two
branches
of
the
service
the
regular
troops
looked
with
contempt
upon
the
unprofessional
movements
of
the
militia
the
militia
railed
at
the
dilatory
and
useless
formalities
of
the
regulars
each
avowed
the
conviction
that
matters
could
be
much
better
conducted
without
the
other
and
the
militia
being
prompt
to
act
sometimes
took
matters
into
their
own
hands
and
brought
on
defeat
and
disgrace
as
in
the
affair
of
stillman
run
the
feeling
of
contempt
which
the
army
officers
entertained
for
the
militia
extended
itself
to
their
subordinates
and
dependants
after
the
visit
of
the
ranger
officers
to
fort
winnebago
before
the
battle
of
the
wisconsin
the
officer
of
the
mess
where
they
had
been
entertained
called
up
his
servant
one
day
to
inquire
into
the
sutler
accounts
he
was
the
same
little
yellow
david
who
had
formerly
appertained
to
captain
harney
david
said
the
young
gentleman
i
see
three
bottles
of
charged
in
the
month
account
of
the
mess
at
the
sutler
what
does
that
mean
if
you
please
lieutenant
said
david
respectfully
it
was
to
sweeten
up
the
and
quarters
after
them
milish
officers
were
here
visiting
black
hawk
and
a
few
of
his
warriors
had
escaped
to
the
north
where
they
were
shortly
after
captured
by
the
and
his
party
and
brought
prisoners
to
general
street
at
prairie
du
chien
the
women
and
children
of
the
band
had
been
put
in
canoes
and
sent
down
the
mississippi
in
hopes
of
being
permitted
to
cross
and
reach
the
rest
of
that
tribe
the
canoes
had
been
tied
together
and
many
of
them
were
upset
and
the
children
drowned
their
mothers
being
too
weak
and
exhausted
to
rescue
them
the
survivors
were
taken
prisoners
and
starving
and
miserable
were
brought
to
prairie
du
chien
our
mother
was
at
the
port
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
she
described
their
condition
as
wretched
and
reduced
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
witnessed
one
woman
who
spoke
a
little
chippewa
gave
her
an
account
of
the
sufferings
and
hardships
they
had
endured
it
was
truly
appalling
after
having
eaten
such
of
the
horses
as
could
be
spared
they
had
subsisted
on
acorns
or
even
grass
many
had
died
of
starvation
and
their
bodies
were
found
lying
in
their
trail
by
the
pursuing
whites
this
poor
woman
had
lost
her
husband
in
battle
and
all
her
children
by
the
upsetting
of
the
canoe
in
which
they
were
and
her
only
wish
now
was
to
go
and
join
them
poor
indians
who
can
wonder
that
they
do
not
love
the
whites
but
a
very
short
time
had
we
been
quietly
at
home
when
a
summons
came
to
my
husband
to
collect
the
principal
chiefs
of
the
winnebagoes
and
meet
general
scott
and
governor
reynolds
at
rock
island
where
it
was
proposed
to
bold
a
treaty
for
the
purchase
of
all
the
lands
east
and
south
of
the
wisconsin
messengers
were
accordingly
sent
to
collect
the
principal
men
and
accompanied
by
as
many
as
chose
to
report
themselves
he
set
off
on
his
journey
he
had
been
gone
about
two
weeks
and
i
was
beginning
to
count
the
days
which
must
elapse
before
i
could
reasonably
expect
his
return
when
one
afternoon
i
went
over
to
pay
a
visit
to
my
sister
at
the
fort
as
i
passed
into
the
large
hall
of
one
range
of
quarters
lieutenant
lacy
came
suddenly
in
from
the
opposite
direction
and
almost
without
stopping
cried
bad
news
madam
have
you
heard
it
no
what
is
it
the
cholera
has
broken
out
at
rock
island
and
they
are
dying
by
five
hundred
a
day
finley
has
just
arrived
with
the
news
so
saying
he
vanished
without
stopping
to
answer
a
question
the
cholera
at
rock
island
and
my
husband
there
i
flew
to
the
other
door
of
the
hall
which
looked
out
upon
the
a
sentinel
was
walking
near
soldier
cried
i
will
you
run
to
the
young
officers
quarters
and
ask
finley
to
come
here
for
a
moment
the
man
shook
his
head
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
his
post
presently
lacy
appeared
from
a
door
under
the
steps
she
was
a
worthless
creature
but
where
was
so
scarce
ladies
could
not
afford
to
keep
a
scrupulous
tariff
of
moral
qualification
oh
catharine
said
i
will
you
run
over
and
ask
finley
to
come
here
a
moment
i
must
hear
what
news
he
has
brought
from
rock
island
she
put
on
a
modest
look
and
said
i
do
not
like
to
go
to
the
young
officers
quarters
i
was
indignant
at
her
hypocrisy
but
i
was
also
wild
with
impatience
when
to
my
great
joy
finley
made
his
appearance
where
is
my
husband
cried
i
on
his
way
home
madam
safe
and
sound
he
will
probably
be
here
he
then
gave
me
an
account
of
the
ravages
the
cholera
was
making
among
the
troops
which
were
indeed
severe
although
less
so
than
rumor
had
at
first
proclaimed
notwithstanding
the
doctor
assurance
of
his
safety
my
husband
was
seized
with
cholera
on
his
journey
by
the
kind
care
of
paquette
and
the
plentiful
use
of
which
the
poor
woman
at
whose
cabin
he
stopped
administered
to
him
he
soon
recovered
and
reached
his
home
in
safety
having
taken
prairie
du
chien
in
his
route
and
brought
his
mother
with
him
again
to
her
home
the
indians
had
consented
to
the
sale
of
their
beautiful
domain
indeed
there
is
no
alternative
in
such
cases
if
they
persist
in
retaining
them
and
become
surrounded
and
hemmed
in
by
the
white
settlers
their
situation
is
more
deplorable
than
if
they
surrendered
their
homes
altogether
this
they
are
aware
of
and
therefore
as
a
general
thing
they
give
up
their
lands
at
the
proposal
of
government
and
only
take
care
to
make
the
best
bargain
they
can
for
themselves
in
this
instance
they
were
to
receive
as
an
equivalent
a
tract
of
land
extending
to
the
interior
of
iowa
and
an
additional
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
annually
one
of
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
was
the
surrender
by
the
winnebagoes
of
certain
individuals
of
their
tribe
accused
of
having
participated
with
the
sauks
in
some
of
the
murders
on
the
frontier
in
order
that
they
might
be
tried
by
our
laws
and
acquitted
or
punished
as
the
case
might
be
the
little
snake
voluntarily
gave
himself
as
a
hostage
until
the
delivery
of
the
suspected
persons
he
was
accordingly
received
by
the
agent
and
marched
over
and
placed
in
confinement
at
the
fort
until
the
seven
accused
should
appear
to
redeem
him
it
was
a
work
of
some
little
time
on
the
part
of
the
nation
to
persuade
these
suspected
individuals
to
place
themselves
in
the
hands
of
the
whites
that
they
might
receive
justice
according
to
the
laws
of
the
latter
the
trial
of
red
bird
and
his
languishing
death
in
prison
were
still
fresh
in
their
memories
and
it
needed
a
good
deal
of
resolution
as
well
as
a
strong
conviction
of
conscious
innocence
to
brace
them
up
to
such
a
step
it
had
to
be
brought
about
by
arguments
and
persuasions
for
the
nation
would
never
have
resorted
to
force
to
compel
the
fulfilment
of
their
stipulation
in
the
mean
time
a
solemn
talk
was
held
with
the
principal
chiefs
assembled
at
the
agency
a
great
part
of
the
nation
were
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
in
obedience
to
a
notice
sent
by
governor
porter
who
in
virtue
of
his
office
of
governor
of
michigan
territory
was
also
superintendent
of
the
northwest
division
of
the
indians
instead
of
calling
upon
the
agent
to
take
charge
of
the
annuity
money
as
had
heretofore
been
the
custom
the
governor
had
announced
his
intention
of
bringing
it
himself
to
fort
winnebago
and
being
present
at
the
payment
the
time
appointed
had
now
arrived
and
with
it
the
main
body
of
the
winnebagoes
such
of
the
indians
as
had
not
attended
the
treaty
at
rock
island
and
been
instrumental
in
the
cession
of
their
country
were
loud
in
their
condemnation
of
the
step
and
their
lamentations
over
it
foremost
among
these
was
the
falstaff
of
garlic
island
and
its
vicinity
it
was
little
wonder
that
he
should
shed
bitter
tears
as
he
did
over
the
loss
of
his
beautiful
home
on
the
blue
waters
of
winnebago
lake
if
he
had
not
been
accidentally
stopped
he
said
on
his
way
to
the
treaty
and
detained
until
it
was
too
late
he
would
never
never
have
permitted
the
bargain
his
father
who
knew
that
a
desperate
frolic
into
which
had
been
enticed
by
the
way
was
the
cause
of
his
failing
to
accompany
his
countrymen
to
rock
island
replied
gravely
that
he
had
heard
of
the
chief
misfortune
on
this
occasion
how
that
in
ascending
the
fox
river
a
couple
of
kegs
of
had
come
floating
down
the
stream
which
running
foul
of
his
canoe
with
great
force
had
injured
it
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
stop
several
days
at
the
to
repair
damages
the
shouts
of
laughter
which
greeted
this
explanation
were
so
contagious
that
poor
himself
was
compelled
to
join
in
it
and
treat
his
misfortune
as
a
joke
the
suspected
indians
having
engaged
the
services
of
judge
doty
to
defend
them
on
their
future
trial
notice
was
at
length
given
that
on
a
certain
day
they
would
be
brought
to
the
portage
and
surrendered
to
their
father
to
be
by
him
transferred
to
the
keeping
of
the
military
officer
appointed
to
receive
them
it
was
joyful
news
to
poor
that
the
day
of
his
release
was
at
hand
every
time
that
we
had
been
within
the
walls
of
the
fort
we
had
been
saluted
by
a
call
from
him
as
he
kept
his
station
at
the
window
do
you
hear
anything
of
those
indians
when
are
they
coming
that
i
may
be
let
out
we
had
endeavored
to
lighten
his
confinement
by
seeing
that
he
was
well
supplied
with
food
and
his
father
and
paquette
had
paid
him
occasional
visits
but
notwithstanding
these
attentions
and
the
kindness
he
had
received
at
the
fort
his
confinement
was
inexpressibly
irksome
on
the
morning
of
a
bright
autumnal
day
the
authorities
were
notified
that
the
chiefs
of
the
nation
would
present
themselves
at
the
agency
to
deliver
the
suspected
persons
as
prisoners
to
the
americans
at
the
hour
of
ten
as
we
looked
out
over
the
portage
road
we
could
descry
a
moving
concourse
of
people
in
which
brilliant
color
glittering
arms
and
as
they
approached
still
nearer
certain
white
objects
of
unusual
appearance
could
be
distinguished
general
dodge
major
plympton
and
one
or
two
other
officers
took
their
seats
with
kinzie
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
door
of
our
mansion
to
receive
them
while
we
stationed
ourselves
at
the
window
where
we
could
both
see
and
hear
the
procession
wound
up
the
hill
and
approached
marching
slowly
towards
us
it
was
a
grand
and
solemn
sight
first
came
some
of
the
principal
chiefs
in
their
most
brilliant
array
next
the
prisoners
all
habited
in
white
cotton
in
token
of
their
innocence
with
girdles
round
their
waists
the
music
of
the
drum
and
the
accompanied
their
which
they
were
chaunting
they
wore
no
paint
no
ornaments
their
countenances
were
grave
and
thoughtful
it
might
well
be
a
serious
moment
to
them
for
they
knew
but
little
of
the
customs
of
the
whites
and
that
little
was
not
such
as
to
inspire
cheerfulness
only
their
father
assurance
that
they
should
receive
strict
justice
would
probably
have
induced
them
to
comply
with
the
engagements
of
the
nation
in
this
manner
the
remainder
of
the
procession
was
made
up
of
a
long
train
of
winnebagoes
all
decked
out
in
their
holiday
garb
the
chiefs
approached
and
shook
hands
with
the
gentlemen
who
stood
ready
to
receive
their
greeting
then
the
prisoners
came
forward
and
went
through
the
same
salutation
with
the
officers
when
they
offered
their
hands
to
their
father
he
declined
no
said
he
you
have
come
here
accused
of
great
crimes
of
having
assisted
in
taking
the
lives
of
some
of
the
defenceless
settlers
when
you
have
been
tried
by
the
laws
of
the
land
and
been
proved
innocent
then
your
father
will
give
you
his
hand
they
looked
still
more
serious
at
this
address
as
if
they
thought
it
indicated
that
their
father
too
believed
them
guilty
and
stepping
back
a
little
they
seated
themselves
without
speaking
in
a
row
upon
the
ground
facing
their
father
and
the
officers
the
other
indians
all
took
seats
in
a
circle
around
them
except
the
chief
the
white
crow
who
had
been
deputed
to
deliver
the
prisoners
to
the
agent
he
made
a
speech
in
which
he
set
forth
that
although
asserting
their
innocence
of
the
charges
preferred
against
them
his
countrymen
were
quite
willing
to
be
tried
by
the
laws
of
white
men
he
hoped
they
would
not
be
detained
long
but
that
the
matter
would
be
investigated
soon
and
that
they
would
come
out
of
it
clear
and
white
in
reply
he
was
assured
that
all
things
would
be
conducted
fairly
and
impartially
exactly
as
if
the
accused
were
white
men
and
the
hope
was
added
that
they
would
be
found
to
have
been
good
and
true
citizens
and
peaceful
children
of
their
great
father
the
president
when
this
was
over
white
crow
requested
permission
to
transfer
the
medal
he
had
received
as
a
mark
of
friendship
from
the
president
to
his
son
who
stood
beside
him
and
who
had
been
chosen
by
the
nation
to
fill
his
place
as
chief
an
office
he
was
desirous
of
resigning
the
speeches
made
upon
this
occasion
as
interpreted
by
paquette
the
modest
demeanor
of
the
young
man
and
the
dignified
yet
feeling
manner
of
the
father
throughout
made
the
whole
ceremony
highly
impressive
and
when
the
latter
took
the
medal
from
his
neck
and
hung
it
around
that
of
his
son
addressing
him
a
few
appropriate
words
i
think
no
one
could
have
witnessed
the
scene
unmoved
i
had
watched
the
countenances
of
the
prisoners
as
they
sat
on
the
ground
before
me
while
all
these
ceremonies
were
going
forward
with
one
exception
they
were
open
calm
and
expressive
of
conscious
innocence
of
that
one
i
could
not
but
admit
there
might
be
reasonable
doubts
one
was
remarkably
another
was
a
boy
of
certainly
not
more
than
seventeen
and
during
the
transfer
of
the
medal
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
listened
to
what
was
uttered
by
the
speakers
with
an
air
and
expression
of
even
childlike
interest
and
satisfaction
our
hearts
felt
sad
for
them
as
the
ceremonies
finished
they
were
conducted
by
a
file
of
soldiers
and
committed
to
the
dungeon
of
the
until
such
time
as
they
should
be
summoned
to
attend
the
court
appointed
to
try
their
cause

escape
of

the
indians
did
not
disperse
after
the
ceremonies
of
the
surrender
had
been
gone
through
they
continued
still
in
the
vicinity
of
the
portage
in
the
constant
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
annuity
money
which
they
had
been
summoned
there
to
receive
but
the
time
for
setting
out
on
his
journey
to
bring
it
was
postponed
by
governor
porter
from
week
to
week
had
he
foreseen
all
the
evils
this
delay
was
to
occasion
he
would
possibly
have
been
more
prompt
in
fulfilling
his
appointment
many
causes
conspired
to
make
an
early
payment
desirable
in
the
first
place
the
winnebagoes
having
been
driven
from
their
homes
by
their
anxiety
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
fraternizing
with
the
sauks
had
made
this
year
no
gardens
nor
they
had
therefore
no
provisions
on
hand
either
for
present
use
or
for
their
winter
consumption
except
their
scanty
supplies
of
wild
rice
while
this
was
disappearing
during
their
protracted
detention
at
the
portage
they
were
running
the
risk
of
leaving
themselves
quite
unprovided
with
food
in
case
of
a
bad
during
the
winter
and
spring
in
the
next
place
the
rations
which
the
agent
had
been
accustomed
by
the
permission
of
government
to
deal
out
occasionally
to
them
were
now
cut
off
by
a
scarcity
in
the
commissary
department
the
frequent
levies
of
the
militia
during
the
summer
campaign
and
the
reinforcement
of
the
garrison
by
the
troops
from
port
howard
had
drawn
so
largely
on
the
stores
at
this
post
that
there
was
necessity
for
the
most
rigid
economy
in
the
issuing
of
supplies
foreseeing
this
state
of
things
kinzie
as
soon
as
the
war
was
at
an
end
commissioned
kercheval
then
sutler
at
fort
howard
to
procure
him
a
couple
of
of
corn
to
be
distributed
among
the
indians
unfortunately
there
was
no
corn
to
be
obtained
from
michigan
it
was
necessary
to
bring
it
from
ohio
and
by
the
time
it
at
length
reached
green
bay
for
in
those
days
business
was
never
done
in
a
hurry
the
navigation
of
the
fox
river
had
closed
and
it
was
detained
there
to
be
brought
up
the
following
spring
as
day
after
day
wore
on
and
the
silver
did
not
make
its
appearance
the
indians
were
advised
by
their
father
to
disperse
to
their
to
procure
food
with
the
promise
that
they
should
be
summoned
immediately
on
the
arrival
of
governor
porter
and
this
advice
they
followed
while
they
had
been
in
our
neighborhood
they
had
more
than
once
asked
permission
to
dance
the
before
our
door
this
is
the
most
frightful
exhibition
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
the
scalps
are
stretched
on
little
hoops
or
frames
and
carried
on
the
end
of
slender
poles
these
are
brandished
about
in
the
course
of
the
dance
with
cries
shouts
and
furious
gestures
the
women
who
commence
as
spectators
becoming
excited
with
the
scene
and
the
music
which
their
own
discordant
notes
help
to
make
more
deafening
rush
in
seize
the
scalps
from
the
hands
of
the
owners
and
toss
them
frantically
about
with
the
screams
and
yells
of
demons
i
have
seen
as
many
as
forty
or
fifty
scalps
figuring
in
one
dance
upon
one
occasion
one
was
borne
by
an
indian
who
approached
quite
near
me
and
i
shuddered
as
i
observed
the
long
fair
hair
evidently
that
of
a
woman
another
indian
had
the
skin
of
a
human
hand
stretched
and
prepared
with
as
much
care
as
if
it
had
been
some
costly
jewel
when
these
dances
occurred
as
they
sometimes
did
by
moonlight
they
were
peculiarly
horrid
and
revolting
amid
so
many
events
of
a
painful
character
there
were
not
wanting
occasionally
some
that
bordered
on
the
ludicrous
one
evening
while
sitting
at
tea
we
were
alarmed
by
the
sound
of
guns
firing
in
the
direction
of
the
wisconsin
all
started
up
and
prepared
instinctively
for
flight
to
the
garrison
as
we
left
the
house
we
found
the
whole
bluff
and
the
meadow
below
in
commotion
indians
running
with
their
guns
and
spears
across
their
shoulders
to
the
scene
of
alarm
squaws
and
children
standing
in
front
of
their
lodges
and
looking
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
the
unusual
and
unaccountable
sounds
groups
of
french
and
like
ourselves
fleeing
to
gain
the
bridge
and
place
themselves
within
the
pickets
so
lately
erected
as
one
company
of
indians
passed
us
hurriedly
some
weapon
carelessly
carried
hit
one
of
our
party
on
the
side
of
the
head
oh
shrieked
she
i
am
killed
an
indian
has
tomahawked
me
and
she
was
only
reassured
by
finding
she
could
still
run
as
fast
as
the
best
of
us
when
we
reached
the
within
the
fort
we
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
grotesque
appearance
we
presented
some
without
hats
or
shawls
others
with
packages
of
valuables
hastily
secured
at
the
moment
one
with
her
piece
of
in
hand
which
she
had
not
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
lay
aside
when
she
took
to
flight
the
alarm
was
in
the
end
found
to
have
proceeded
from
a
party
of
winnebagoes
from
one
of
the
barribault
villages
who
being
about
to
leave
their
home
for
a
period
were
going
through
the
ceremony
of
burying
the
scalps
which
they
and
their
fathers
had
taken
like
the
military
funerals
among
civilized
nations
their
solemnities
were
closed
on
this
occasion
by
the
discharge
of
several
volleys
over
the
grave
of
their
trophies
at
length
about
the
beginning
of
november
two
months
after
the
time
appointed
governor
porter
accompanied
by
major
forsyth
and
kercheval
arrived
with
the
annuity
money
the
indians
were
again
assembled
the
payment
was
made
and
having
supplied
themselves
with
a
larger
quantity
of
ammunition
than
usual
for
they
saw
the
necessity
of
a
good
hunt
to
remedy
past
and
present
deficiencies
they
set
off
for
their
wintering
grounds
we
were
ourselves
about
changing
our
quarters
to
our
no
small
satisfaction
notwithstanding
the
indian
disturbances
the
new
agency
house
permission
to
build
which
had
after
much
delay
been
accorded
by
government
had
been
going
steadily
on
and
soon
after
the
departure
of
the
governor
and
his
party
we
took
possession
of
it
we
had
been
settled
but
a
few
weeks
when
one
morning
lieutenant
davies
appeared
just
as
we
were
sitting
down
to
breakfast
with
a
face
full
of
consternation
indian
prisoners
had
escaped
from
the
the
commanding
officer
colonel
cutler
had
sent
for
kinzie
to
come
over
to
the
fort
and
counsel
with
him
what
was
to
be
done
the
prisoners
had
probably
commenced
their
operations
very
soon
after
being
placed
in
the
a
dungeon
in
the
basement
of
the
they
observed
that
their
meals
were
brought
regularly
three
times
a
day
and
that
in
the
intervals
they
were
left
entirely
to
themselves
with
their
knives
they
commenced
excavating
an
opening
the
earth
from
which
as
it
was
withdrawn
they
spread
about
on
the
floor
of
their
prison
a
blanket
was
placed
over
the
hole
and
one
of
the
company
was
always
seated
upon
it
before
the
regular
time
for
the
soldier
who
had
charge
of
them
to
make
his
appearance
when
the
periodical
visit
was
made
the
indians
were
always
observed
to
be
seated
smoking
in
the
most
orderly
and
quiet
manner
there
was
never
anything
in
their
appearance
to
excite
suspicion
the
prisoners
had
never
read
the
memoirs
of
baron
trenck
but
they
had
watched
the
proceedings
of
the
badgers
so
profiting
by
their
example
they
worked
on
shaping
the
opening
spirally
until
in
about
six
weeks
they
came
out
to
the
open
air
beyond
the
walls
of
the
fort
that
they
might
be
as
little
encumbered
as
possible
in
their
flight
they
left
their
blankets
behind
them
and
although
it
was
bitter
december
weather
they
took
to
the
woods
and
prairies
with
only
their
calico
shirts
and
leggings
for
covering
we
can
readily
believe
that
hope
and
exultation
kept
them
comfortably
warm
until
they
reached
an
asylum
among
their
friends
it
would
be
compromising
our
own
reputation
as
loyal
and
patriotic
citizens
to
tell
of
the
secret
rejoicing
this
news
occasioned
us
the
question
now
was
how
to
get
the
fugitives
back
again
the
agent
could
promise
no
more
than
that
he
would
communicate
with
the
chiefs
and
represent
the
wishes
of
the
officers
that
the
prisoners
should
once
more
surrender
themselves
and
thus
free
those
who
had
had
the
charge
of
them
from
the
imputation
of
carelessness
which
the
government
would
be
very
likely
to
throw
upon
them
when
according
to
their
custom
many
of
the
chiefs
assembled
at
the
agency
on
day
their
father
laid
the
subject
before
them
the
indians
replied
that
they
saw
the
young
they
would
tell
them
what
the
officers
would
like
to
have
them
do
they
could
themselves
do
nothing
in
the
matter
they
had
fulfilled
their
engagement
by
bringing
them
once
and
putting
them
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
the
government
had
had
them
in
its
power
once
and
could
not
keep
them
it
must
now
go
and
catch
them
itself
the
government
having
had
some
experience
the
past
summer
in
catching
indians
wisely
concluded
to
drop
the
matter
about
this
time
another
event
occurred
which
occasioned
no
small
excitement
in
our
little
community
robineau
the
striker
from
the
blacksmith
establishment
at
sugar
creek
near
the
four
lakes
arrived
one
very
cold
day
at
the
agency
he
had
come
to
procure
medical
aid
for
mâtâ
eldest
daughter
sophy
who
while
sliding
on
the
lake
had
fallen
on
the
ice
and
been
badly
hurt
her
father
was
absent
having
gone
to
prairie
du
chien
to
place
his
youngest
daughter
at
school
two
or
three
days
had
elapsed
since
the
accident
had
happened
a
high
fever
had
set
in
and
the
poor
girl
was
in
a
state
of
great
suffering
it
had
therefore
been
thought
best
to
send
robineau
to
us
for
advice
and
aid
leaving
turcotte
and
a
friendly
indian
woman
from
a
neighboring
lodge
to
take
charge
of
poor
sophy
the
commanding
officer
did
not
think
it
prudent
when
the
subject
was
laid
before
him
to
permit
the
surgeon
to
leave
the
post
but
he
very
cheerfully
granted
leave
of
absence
to
currie
the
hospital
steward
a
young
man
who
possessed
some
knowledge
of
medicine
and
surgery
as
it
was
important
that
sophy
should
have
an
experienced
nurse
we
procured
the
services
of
madame
bellaire
the
wife
of
the
frenchman
who
was
generally
employed
as
express
to
chicago
and
as
an
aid
and
companion
agathe
a
daughter
of
who
lived
in
family
was
added
to
the
party
of
agathe
i
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
the
weather
was
excessively
cold
when
robineau
currie
and
the
two
women
set
out
for
sugar
creek
a
distance
of
about
forty
miles
we
had
provided
them
with
a
good
store
of
rice
crackers
tea
and
sugar
for
the
invalid
all
of
which
with
their
provisions
for
the
way
were
packed
on
the
horse
robineau
had
ridden
to
the
portage
it
was
expected
they
would
reach
their
place
of
destination
on
the
second
day
what
then
was
our
surprise
to
see
turcotte
make
his
appearance
on
the
fourth
day
after
their
departure
to
inquire
why
robineau
had
not
returned
with
aid
for
poor
sophy
there
was
but
one
solution
of
the
mystery
robineau
had
guided
them
as
ill
as
he
had
guided
the
boat
at
the
grande
chûte
the
summer
before
and
although
he
could
not
shipwreck
them
he
had
undoubtedly
lost
them
in
the
woods
or
prairies
one
comfort
was
that
they
could
not
well
starve
for
the
rice
and
crackers
would
furnish
them
with
several
days
provisions
and
with
agathe
who
must
be
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
life
they
could
not
fail
in
time
of
finding
indians
and
being
brought
back
to
the
portage
still
day
after
day
went
on
and
we
received
no
tidings
of
them
turcotte
returned
to
sugar
creek
with
comforts
and
prescriptions
for
sophy
and
colonel
cutler
sent
out
a
party
to
hunt
for
the
missing
ones
among
whom
poor
currie
from
his
delicate
constitution
was
the
object
of
our
greatest
commiseration
as
the
snow
fell
and
the
winds
howled
we
could
employ
ourselves
about
nothing
but
walking
from
window
to
window
watching
in
hopes
of
seeing
some
one
appear
in
the
distance
no
indians
were
at
hand
whom
we
could
dispatch
upon
the
search
and
by
the
tenth
day
we
had
almost
given
up
in
despair
it
was
then
that
the
joyful
news
was
suddenly
brought
us
they
are
found
they
are
at
the
fort
a
party
of
soldiers
who
had
been
exploring
had
encountered
them
at
hastings
woods
twelve
miles
distant
slowly
and
feebly
making
their
way
back
to
the
portage
they
knew
they
were
on
the
right
track
but
had
hardly
strength
to
pursue
it
exhausted
with
cold
and
hunger
for
their
provisions
had
given
out
two
days
before
they
had
thought
seriously
of
killing
the
horse
and
eating
him
nothing
but
currie
inability
to
proceed
on
foot
and
the
dread
of
being
compelled
to
leave
him
in
the
woods
to
perish
had
deterred
them
agathe
had
from
the
first
been
convinced
that
they
were
on
the
wrong
track
but
robineau
with
his
usual
obstinacy
persevered
in
keeping
it
until
it
brought
them
to
the
rock
river
when
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
his
error
and
they
commenced
retracing
their
steps
agathe
according
to
the
custom
of
her
people
had
carried
her
hatchet
with
her
and
thus
they
had
always
had
a
fire
at
night
and
boughs
to
shelter
them
from
the
storms
otherwise
they
must
inevitably
have
perished
there
were
two
circumstances
which
aroused
in
us
a
stronger
feeling
even
than
that
of
sympathy
the
first
was
the
miserable
robineau
having
demanded
of
currie
first
all
his
money
and
afterwards
his
watch
as
a
condition
of
his
bringing
the
party
back
into
the
right
path
which
he
averred
he
knew
perfectly
well
the
second
was
bellaire
giving
his
kind
excellent
wife
a
hearty
flogging
for
going
off
as
he
said
on
such
a
fool
errand
the
latter
culprit
was
out
of
our
jurisdiction
but
mons
robineau
was
discharged
on
the
spot
and
warned
that
he
might
think
himself
happy
to
escape
a
legal
process
for
swindling
i
am
happy
to
say
that
sophy
mâtâ
in
whose
behalf
all
these
sufferings
had
been
endured
was
quite
recovered
by
the
time
her
father
returned
from
the
prairie
chapter
xxxvii
agathe
tomah
agathe
was
the
daughter
of
an
indian
who
was
distinguished
by
the
name
of
whether
he
merited
the
appellation
must
be
determined
hereafter
he
was
brother
to
the
grand
old
chief
of
that
name
but
as
unlike
him
as
it
is
possible
for
those
of
the
same
blood
to
be
the
were
a
very
handsome
family
and
this
daughter
was
remarkable
for
her
fine
personal
endowments
a
tall
form
a
round
sweet
face
and
that
peculiarly
soft
melodious
voice
which
belongs
to
the
women
of
her
people
would
have
attracted
the
attention
of
a
stranger
while
the
pensive
expression
of
her
countenance
irresistibly
drew
the
hearts
of
all
towards
her
and
prompted
the
wish
to
know
more
of
her
history
as
i
received
it
from
her
friend
paquette
it
was
indeed
a
touching
one
a
young
officer
at
the
fort
had
seen
her
and
had
set
i
will
not
say
his
heart
it
may
be
doubted
if
he
had
one
but
his
mind
upon
her
he
applied
to
paquette
to
negotiate
what
he
called
a
marriage
with
her
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
paquette
was
induced
to
enter
into
this
scheme
he
knew
full
well
the
sin
of
making
false
representations
to
the
family
of
agathe
and
he
knew
the
misery
he
was
about
to
bring
upon
her
the
poor
girl
had
been
betrothed
to
a
young
man
of
her
own
people
and
as
is
generally
the
case
the
attachment
on
both
sides
was
very
strong
among
these
simple
people
who
have
few
subjects
of
thought
or
speculation
beyond
the
interests
of
their
daily
life
their
affections
and
their
animosities
form
the
warp
and
woof
of
their
character
all
their
feelings
are
intense
from
being
concentrated
on
so
few
objects
family
relations
particularly
with
the
women
engross
the
whole
amount
of
their
sensibilities
the
marriage
connection
is
a
sacred
and
indissoluble
tie
i
have
read
in
a
recent
report
to
the
historical
society
of
wisconsin
that
in
former
times
a
temporary
marriage
between
a
white
man
and
a
menomonee
woman
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
and
that
such
an
arrangement
brought
no
scandal
i
am
afraid
that
if
such
eases
were
investigated
a
good
deal
of
deceit
and
misrepresentation
would
be
found
to
have
been
added
to
the
other
sins
of
the
transaction
and
that
the
woman
would
be
found
to
have
been
a
victim
instead
of
a
willing
participant
in
such
a
connection
at
all
events
no
system
of
this
kind
exists
among
the
winnebagoes
the
strictest
sense
of
female
propriety
is
a
distinguishing
trait
among
them
a
woman
who
transgresses
it
is
said
to
have
forgotten
herself
and
is
sure
to
be
cast
off
and
forgotten
by
her
friends
the
marriage
proposed
between
the
young
officer
and
the
daughter
of
was
understood
as
intended
to
be
true
and
lasting
the
father
would
not
have
exposed
himself
to
the
contempt
of
his
whole
nation
by
selling
his
daughter
to
become
the
mistress
of
any
man
the
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
were
not
a
little
proud
of
a
remote
cross
of
french
blood
which
mingled
with
the
aboriginal
stream
in
their
veins
and
probably
in
acceding
to
the
proposed
connection
the
father
of
agathe
was
as
much
influenced
by
what
he
considered
the
honor
to
be
derived
as
by
the
amount
of
valuable
presents
which
accompanied
the
overtures
made
to
him
be
that
as
it
may
the
poor
girl
was
torn
from
her
lover
and
transferred
from
her
father
lodge
to
the
quarters
of
the
young
officer
there
were
no
ladies
in
the
garrison
at
that
time
had
there
been
such
a
step
would
hardly
have
been
ventured
far
away
in
the
wilderness
shut
out
from
the
salutary
influences
of
religious
and
social
cultivation
what
wonder
that
the
moral
sense
sometimes
becomes
blinded
and
that
the
choice
is
made
evil
be
thou
my
good
the
first
step
in
wrong
was
followed
by
one
still
more
aggravated
in
cruelty
the
young
officer
left
the
post
as
he
said
on
furlough
but
never
the
news
came
after
a
time
that
he
was
married
and
when
he
again
joined
his
regiment
it
was
at
another
post
there
was
a
natural
feeling
in
the
strength
of
the
woe
pronounced
against
him
by
more
tongues
than
one
he
will
never
said
my
informant
dare
show
himself
in
this
country
again
not
an
indian
who
knows
the
but
would
take
his
life
if
he
should
meet
him
every
tie
was
broken
for
poor
agathe
but
that
which
bound
her
to
her
infant
she
never
returned
to
her
father
lodge
for
she
felt
that
being
deserted
she
was
dishonored
her
sole
ambition
seemed
to
be
to
bring
up
her
child
like
those
of
the
whites
she
attired
it
in
the
costume
of
the
french
children
with
a
dress
of
bright
calico
and
a
cap
of
the
same
trimmed
with
narrow
black
lace
it
was
a
fine
child
and
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
a
smile
cross
her
face
was
when
it
was
commended
and
caressed
by
some
member
of
our
family
even
this
her
only
source
of
happiness
poor
agathe
was
called
upon
to
resign
during
our
absence
at
green
bay
while
the
sauks
were
in
the
neighborhood
the
child
was
taken
violently
ill
the
house
at
paquette
which
was
the
mother
home
was
thronged
with
indians
and
of
course
there
was
much
noise
and
disturbance
my
husband
had
a
place
prepared
for
her
under
our
roof
where
she
could
be
more
quiet
and
receive
the
attendance
of
the
post
physician
it
was
all
in
vain
nothing
could
save
the
little
creature
life
the
bitter
agony
of
the
mother
as
she
hung
over
the
only
treasure
she
possessed
on
earth
was
described
to
me
as
truly
when
compelled
to
part
with
it
it
seemed
almost
more
than
nature
could
bear
there
were
friends
not
of
her
own
nation
or
color
who
strove
to
comfort
her
did
the
father
ever
send
a
thought
or
an
inquiry
after
the
fate
of
his
child
or
of
the
young
being
whose
life
he
had
rendered
dark
and
desolate
we
will
hope
that
he
did
that
he
repented
and
asked
pardon
from
above
for
the
evil
he
had
wrought
agathe
had
been
baptized
by
mazzuchelli
perhaps
she
may
have
acquired
some
religious
knowledge
which
could
bring
her
consolation
in
her
sorrows
and
compensate
her
for
the
hopes
and
joys
so
early
blasted
she
came
some
months
after
the
death
of
her
child
in
company
with
several
of
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
to
pay
me
a
visit
of
respect
and
congratulation
on
the
advent
of
the
when
she
looked
at
her
little
brother
as
he
was
called
and
took
his
soft
tiny
hand
within
her
own
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
she
spoke
some
little
words
of
tenderness
which
showed
that
her
heart
was
full
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
mingling
my
tears
with
hers
as
i
thought
on
all
the
sorrow
and
desolation
that
one
selfishness
had
occasioned
early
in
february
my
husband
and
lieutenant
hunter
in
company
with
one
or
two
others
set
off
on
a
journey
to
chicago
that
place
had
become
so
much
of
a
town
it
contained
perhaps
fifty
inhabitants
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
proprietors
of
kinzie
addition
to
lay
out
lots
and
open
streets
through
their
property
all
this
was
accomplished
during
the
visit
in
question
while
they
were
upon
the
ground
with
a
surveyor
the
attention
of
my
husband
was
drawn
towards
a
very
boy
in
indian
costume
who
went
hopping
along
by
the
side
of
the
assistant
that
carried
the
chain
mimicking
him
as
in
the
course
of
his
operations
he
cried
stick
stuck
he
inquired
who
the
lad
was
and
to
his
surprise
learned
that
he
was
the
brother
of
the
old
family
servants
victoire
genevieve
and
baptiste
tomah
for
that
was
his
name
had
never
been
arrayed
in
civilized
costume
he
was
in
blanket
and
leggings
and
had
always
lived
in
a
wigwam
my
husband
inquired
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
fort
winnebago
with
him
and
learn
to
be
a
white
boy
the
idea
pleased
him
much
and
his
mother
having
given
her
sanction
to
the
arrangement
he
was
packed
in
a
wagon
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
their
travelling
gear
when
they
set
forth
on
their
tomah
had
been
equipped
in
jacket
and
trousers
with
the
other
articles
of
apparel
necessary
to
his
new
sphere
and
character
they
were
near
the
aux
plaines
and
approaching
the
residence
of
glode
claude
laframboise
where
tomah
knew
he
should
meet
acquaintances
he
asked
leave
to
get
out
of
the
wagon
and
walk
a
little
way
when
the
gentlemen
next
saw
him
he
was
in
full
pottowattamie
costume
although
it
was
bitter
winter
weather
he
had
put
on
his
uncomfortable
native
garb
rather
than
show
himself
to
his
old
friends
in
a
state
of
transformation
on
his
arrival
at
fort
winnebago
our
first
care
was
to
furnish
him
with
a
complete
wardrobe
which
having
been
placed
in
a
box
in
his
was
put
under
his
charge
words
can
not
express
his
delight
as
the
valuable
possessions
were
confided
to
him
every
spare
moment
was
devoted
to
their
contemplation
now
and
then
tomah
would
be
missing
he
was
invariably
found
seated
by
the
side
of
his
little
trunk
folding
and
refolding
his
clothes
laying
them
now
lengthwise
now
crosswise
the
happiest
of
mortals
our
next
step
was
to
teach
him
to
be
useful
such
little
offices
were
assigned
to
him
at
first
as
might
be
supposed
not
altogether
new
to
him
but
we
soon
observed
that
when
there
was
anything
in
the
shape
of
work
tomah
slipped
off
to
bed
even
if
it
were
before
he
had
taken
his
supper
some
fish
were
given
him
one
evening
to
scale
it
was
just
at
dark
but
tom
according
to
custom
retired
at
once
to
bed
the
cook
came
to
inquire
what
was
to
be
done
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
calling
in
my
husband
aid
as
interpreter
he
sent
for
tomah
when
he
came
into
the
parlor
kinzie
said
to
him
in
pottowattamie
there
are
some
fish
tomah
in
the
kitchen
and
we
want
you
to
scale
them
now
exclaimed
tom
with
an
expression
of
amazement
it
is
very
late
a
young
lady
miss
rolette
who
was
visiting
us
and
who
understood
the
language
could
not
refrain
from
bursting
into
a
laugh
at
the
simplicity
with
which
the
words
were
uttered
and
we
joined
her
in
sympathy
at
which
tom
looked
a
little
indignant
but
when
he
understood
that
it
was
the
to
scale
the
fish
at
night
and
put
salt
and
pepper
on
them
he
was
soon
reconciled
to
do
his
duty
in
the
matter
his
next
office
was
to
lay
the
table
there
was
a
best
service
of
china
which
was
only
used
when
we
had
company
and
a
best
set
of
teaspoons
which
i
kept
in
the
drawer
of
a
bureau
in
my
own
room
i
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
this
drawer
locked
and
putting
the
key
under
a
small
clock
on
the
the
first
time
that
i
had
shown
tomah
how
to
arrange
matters
for
visitors
i
had
brought
the
silver
and
put
it
on
the
table
myself
soon
after
we
were
to
have
company
to
tea
again
and
i
explained
to
tomah
that
the
best
china
must
be
used
what
was
my
surprise
on
going
through
the
a
short
time
after
to
see
not
only
the
new
china
but
the
company
silver
also
on
the
table
i
requested
our
mother
who
could
speak
with
him
to
inquire
into
the
matter
tomah
said
very
coolly
he
got
the
silver
where
it
was
kept
did
he
find
the
drawer
open
no
he
opened
it
with
a
key
was
the
key
in
the
drawer
no
it
was
under
that
thing
on
the
shelf
how
did
he
know
it
was
kept
there
this
was
what
tomah
declined
telling
we
could
never
ascertain
whether
he
had
watched
my
movements
at
any
time
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
in
that
part
of
the
house
and
yet
scarcely
an
article
could
be
mentioned
of
which
tomah
did
not
know
the
whereabouts
if
any
one
was
puzzled
to
find
a
thing
it
was
always
ask
tomah
he
will
tell
you
and
so
in
fact
he
did
he
was
a
subject
of
much
amusement
to
the
young
officers
we
were
to
have
a
one
evening
all
the
families
and
young
officers
from
the
fort
to
make
tomah
appearance
as
professional
as
possible
we
made
him
a
white
apron
with
long
sleeves
to
put
on
while
he
was
helping
mary
and
josette
to
carry
round
tea
for
i
must
acknowledge
that
clothes
were
not
kept
in
as
nice
order
out
of
the
trunk
as
in
it
tom
was
delighted
with
his
new
costume
as
well
as
with
the
new
employment
he
acquitted
himself
to
perfection
for
he
had
never
any
difficulty
in
imitating
what
he
saw
another
do
after
tea
we
had
some
music
as
i
was
standing
by
the
piano
at
which
one
of
the
ladies
was
seated
lieutenant
vancleve
said
to
me
in
a
low
tone
look
behind
you
a
moment
i
turned
there
sat
tom
between
two
of
the
company
as
stately
as
possible
with
his
white
apron
smoothed
down
and
his
hands
clasped
before
him
listening
to
the
music
and
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
himself
and
all
around
him
julian
and
edwin
were
hardly
able
to
restrain
their
merriment
but
they
were
afraid
to
do
or
say
anything
that
would
cause
him
to
move
before
the
company
had
had
a
full
enjoyment
of
the
scene
it
was
voted
unanimously
that
tomah
should
be
permitted
to
remain
and
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
society
for
one
evening
but
with
characteristic
restlessness
he
got
tired
as
soon
as
the
music
was
over
and
unceremoniously
took
his
leave
of
the
company
chapter
xxxviii
conclusion
what
we
had
long
anticipated
of
the
sufferings
of
the
indians
began
to
manifest
itself
as
the
spring
drew
on
its
extent
was
first
brought
to
our
knowledge
by
those
who
came
in
little
parties
begging
for
food
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
issue
occasional
rations
their
father
continued
to
do
so
but
the
supplies
in
the
commissary
department
were
now
so
much
reduced
that
colonel
cutler
did
not
feel
justified
in
authorizing
anything
beyond
a
scanty
relief
and
this
only
in
extreme
cases
we
had
ourselves
throughout
the
winter
used
the
greatest
economy
with
our
own
stores
that
we
might
not
exhaust
our
slender
stock
of
flour
and
meal
before
it
could
be
replenished
from
below
we
had
even
purchased
some
sour
flour
which
had
been
condemned
by
the
commissary
and
had
contrived
by
a
plentiful
use
of
saleratus
and
a
due
proportion
of
potatoes
to
make
of
it
a
very
palatable
kind
of
bread
but
as
we
had
continued
to
give
to
party
after
party
when
they
would
come
to
us
to
represent
their
famishing
condition
the
time
at
length
arrived
when
we
had
nothing
to
give
the
families
of
the
neighborhood
who
had
like
ourselves
continued
to
share
with
the
needy
as
long
as
their
own
stock
lasted
were
now
obliged
of
necessity
to
refuse
further
assistance
these
women
often
came
to
lament
with
us
over
the
sad
accounts
that
were
brought
from
the
wintering
grounds
it
had
been
a
very
open
winter
the
snow
had
scarcely
been
enough
at
any
time
to
permit
the
indians
to
track
the
deer
in
fact
all
the
game
had
been
driven
off
by
the
troops
and
scouring
the
country
through
the
preceding
summer
we
heard
of
their
dying
by
companies
from
mere
inanition
and
lying
stretched
in
the
road
to
the
portage
whither
they
were
striving
to
drag
their
exhausted
frames
soup
made
of
the
bark
of
the
slippery
elm
or
stewed
acorns
were
the
only
food
that
many
had
subsisted
on
for
weeks
we
had
for
a
long
time
received
our
own
food
by
daily
rations
from
the
garrison
for
things
had
got
to
such
a
pass
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
obtaining
a
barrel
of
flour
at
a
time
after
our
meals
were
finished
i
always
went
into
the
pantry
and
collecting
carefully
every
remaining
particle
of
food
set
it
aside
to
be
given
to
some
of
the
wretched
applicants
by
whom
we
were
constantly
thronged
one
day
as
i
was
thus
employed
a
face
appeared
at
the
window
with
which
i
had
once
been
familiar
it
was
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
elder
she
had
formerly
visited
us
often
watching
with
great
interest
our
employments
our
sewing
our
weeding
and
cultivating
the
garden
or
our
reading
of
the
latter
i
had
many
times
endeavored
to
give
her
some
idea
showing
her
the
plates
in
the
family
bible
and
doing
my
best
to
explain
them
to
her
but
of
late
i
had
quite
lost
sight
of
her
now
how
changed
how
wan
she
looked
as
i
addressed
her
with
my
ordinary
phrase
what
is
it
she
gave
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
sob
she
did
not
beg
but
her
countenance
spoke
volumes
i
took
my
dish
and
handed
it
to
her
expecting
to
see
her
devour
the
contents
eagerly
but
no
she
took
it
and
making
signs
that
she
would
soon
return
walked
away
when
she
brought
it
back
i
was
almost
sure
she
had
not
tasted
a
morsel
herself
oh
the
boats
the
boats
with
the
corn
why
did
they
not
come
we
both
wrote
and
sent
to
hasten
them
but
alas
everything
and
everybody
moved
so
slowly
in
those
unenterprising
times
we
could
only
feel
sure
that
they
would
come
when
they
were
ready
and
not
a
moment
before
we
were
soon
obliged
to
keep
both
doors
and
windows
fast
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
misery
we
could
not
relieve
if
a
door
were
opened
for
the
admission
of
a
member
of
the
family
some
wretched
mother
would
rush
in
grasp
the
hand
of
my
infant
and
placing
that
of
her
famishing
child
within
it
tell
us
pleadingly
that
he
was
imploring
his
little
brother
for
food
the
stoutest
man
could
not
have
beheld
with
dry
eyes
the
spectacle
which
often
presented
itself
it
was
in
vain
that
we
screened
the
lower
portion
of
our
windows
with
curtains
they
would
climb
up
on
the
outside
and
tier
upon
tier
of
gaunt
wretched
faces
would
peer
in
above
to
watch
us
and
see
if
indeed
we
were
as
ill
provided
as
we
represented
ourselves
the
noble
old
came
one
day
from
the
barribault
to
apprise
us
of
the
state
of
his
village
more
than
forty
of
his
people
he
said
had
now
been
for
many
days
without
food
save
bark
and
roots
my
husband
accompanied
him
to
the
commanding
officer
to
tell
his
story
and
ascertain
if
any
amount
of
food
could
be
obtained
from
that
quarter
the
result
was
the
promise
of
a
small
allowance
of
flour
sufficient
to
alleviate
the
cravings
of
his
own
family
when
this
was
explained
to
the
chief
he
turned
away
no
he
said
if
his
people
could
not
be
relieved
he
and
his
family
would
starve
with
them
and
he
refused
for
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
the
proffered
succor
until
all
could
share
alike
the
announcement
at
length
that
the
boats
were
in
sight
was
a
thrilling
and
most
joyful
sound
hundreds
of
poor
creatures
were
assembled
on
the
bank
watching
their
arrival
oh
how
torturing
was
their
slow
approach
by
the
winding
course
of
the
river
through
the
extended
prairie
as
the
first
boat
touched
the
land
we
who
were
gazing
on
the
scene
with
anxiety
and
impatience
only
equalled
by
that
of
the
sufferers
could
scarcely
refrain
from
laughing
to
see
old
who
had
somewhat
fallen
off
in
his
huge
amount
of
flesh
seize
the
washington
woman
in
his
arms
and
hug
and
dance
with
her
in
the
ecstasy
of
his
delight
their
father
made
a
sign
to
them
all
to
fall
to
work
with
their
hatchets
which
they
had
long
held
ready
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
barrel
after
barrel
of
corn
was
broken
open
and
emptied
while
even
the
little
children
possessed
themselves
of
pans
and
kettles
full
and
hastened
to
the
fires
that
were
blazing
around
to
parch
and
cook
that
which
they
had
seized
from
this
time
forward
there
was
no
more
destitution
the
present
abundance
was
immediately
followed
by
the
arrival
of
supplies
for
the
commissary
department
and
refreshed
and
invigorated
our
poor
children
departed
once
more
to
their
villages
to
make
ready
their
crops
for
the
ensuing
season
in
the
course
of
the
spring
we
received
a
visit
from
the
rev
kent
and
kent
of
galena
this
event
is
memorable
as
being
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
gospel
according
to
the
protestant
faith
was
preached
at
fort
winnebago
the
large
parlor
of
the
hospital
was
fitted
up
for
the
service
and
gladly
did
we
each
say
to
the
other
let
us
go
to
the
house
of
the
lord
for
nearly
three
years
had
we
lived
here
without
the
blessing
of
a
public
service
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
we
regarded
this
commencement
as
an
omen
of
better
times
and
our
little
worked
with
renewed
industry
to
raise
a
fund
which
might
be
available
hereafter
in
securing
the
permanent
services
of
a
missionary
not
long
after
this
on
a
fine
spring
morning
as
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
a
party
of
indians
entered
the
parlor
and
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
we
were
two
of
them
passed
through
and
went
out
upon
a
small
portico
the
third
remained
standing
in
the
at
which
he
had
at
first
appeared
he
was
nearly
opposite
me
and
as
i
raised
my
eyes
spite
of
his
change
of
dress
and
the
paint
with
which
he
was
covered
i
at
once
recognized
him
i
continued
to
pour
the
coffee
and
as
i
did
so
i
remarked
to
my
husband
the
one
behind
you
with
whom
you
are
speaking
is
one
of
the
escaped
prisoners
without
turning
his
head
kinzie
continued
to
listen
to
all
the
directions
they
were
giving
him
about
the
repairing
of
their
guns
traps
which
they
wished
to
leave
with
the
blacksmith
as
they
went
on
he
carelessly
turned
towards
the
parlor
door
and
replied
to
the
one
speaking
to
him
when
he
again
addressed
me
it
was
to
say
you
are
right
but
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
we
are
none
of
us
to
look
so
as
to
give
him
notice
that
we
suspect
anything
they
are
undoubtedly
innocent
and
have
suffered
enough
already
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
their
father
did
not
ask
their
names
but
wrote
their
directions
which
he
tied
to
their
different
implements
and
then
bade
them
go
and
deliver
them
themselves
to
morrin
the
rest
of
our
circle
were
greatly
pleased
at
the
young
audacity
and
we
quite
longed
to
tell
the
officers
that
we
could
have
caught
one
of
their
fugitives
for
them
if
we
had
had
a
mind
the
time
had
now
come
when
we
began
to
think
seriously
of
leaving
our
pleasant
home
and
taking
up
our
residence
at
detroit
while
making
arrangements
for
a
permanent
settlement
at
chicago
this
intelligence
when
communicated
to
our
winnebago
children
brought
forth
great
lamentations
and
demonstrations
of
regret
from
the
surrounding
country
they
came
flocking
in
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
the
tidings
they
had
heard
and
to
petition
earnestly
that
we
would
continue
to
live
and
die
among
them
among
them
all
no
one
seemed
so
overwhelmed
with
affliction
as
elizabeth
our
poor
when
we
first
told
her
of
our
intention
she
sat
for
hours
in
the
same
spot
wiping
away
the
tears
that
would
find
their
way
down
her
cheeks
with
the
corner
of
the
chintz
shawl
she
wore
pinned
across
her
bosom
no
i
never
never
never
shall
i
find
such
friends
again
she
would
exclaim
you
will
go
away
and
i
shall
be
left
here
too
the
fat
jolly
gave
way
to
the
most
audible
lamentations
oh
my
little
brother
he
said
to
the
baby
on
the
morning
of
our
departure
when
he
had
insisted
on
taking
him
and
seating
him
on
his
fat
dirty
knee
you
will
never
come
back
to
see
your
poor
brother
again
and
having
taken
an
extra
glass
on
the
occasion
he
wept
like
an
infant
it
was
with
sad
hearts
that
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
we
bade
adieu
to
the
long
cortége
which
followed
us
to
the
boat
now
waiting
to
convey
us
to
green
bay
where
we
were
to
meet
governor
porter
and
brush
and
proceed
under
their
escort
to
detroit
when
they
had
completed
their
tender
farewells
they
turned
to
accompany
their
father
across
the
portage
on
his
route
to
chicago
and
long
after
we
could
see
them
winding
along
the
road
and
hear
their
loud
lamentations
at
a
parting
which
they
foresaw
would
be
forever
appendix
i
as
i
have
given
throughout
the
narrative
of
the
sauk
war
the
impressions
we
received
from
our
own
observation
or
from
information
furnished
us
at
the
time
i
think
it
but
justice
to
black
hawk
and
his
party
to
insert
by
way
of
appendix
the
following
account
preserved
among
the
manuscript
records
of
the
late
thomas
forsyth
of
louis
who
after
residing
among
the
indians
many
years
as
a
trader
was
until
the
year
the
agent
of
the
sauks
and
foxes
the
manuscript
was
written
in
while
black
hawk
and
his
compatriots
were
in
prison
at
jefferson
barracks
the
united
states
troops
under
the
command
of
major
stoddard
arrived
here
and
took
possession
of
this
country
in
the
month
of
february
in
the
spring
of
that
year
a
white
person
a
man
or
boy
was
killed
in
cuivre
settlement
by
a
sauk
indian
some
time
in
the
summer
following
a
party
of
united
states
troops
were
sent
up
to
the
sauk
village
on
rocky
biver
and
a
demand
made
of
the
sauk
chiefs
for
the
murderer
the
sauk
chiefs
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
but
delivered
him
up
to
the
commander
of
the
troops
who
brought
him
down
and
delivered
him
over
to
the
civil
authority
in
this
place
louis
some
time
in
the
ensuing
autumn
some
sauk
and
fox
indians
came
to
this
place
and
had
a
conversation
with
general
harrison
then
governor
of
indiana
territory
and
acting
governor
of
this
state
then
territory
of
louisiana
on
the
subject
of
liberating
their
relative
then
in
prison
at
this
place
for
the
murder
a
sauk
chief
who
was
the
head
man
of
this
party
has
repeatedly
said
pierre
chouteau
came
several
times
to
my
camp
offering
that
if
i
would
sell
the
lands
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
river
governor
harrison
would
liberate
my
relation
meaning
the
sauk
indian
then
in
prison
as
above
related
to
which
i
at
last
agreed
and
sold
the
lands
from
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
up
the
mississippi
river
as
high
as
the
mouth
of
rocky
river

and
east
to
the

that
divides

treaty
dated

the
sauk
and
fox
nations
were
never
consulted
nor
had
any
hand
in
this
treaty
nor
knew
anything
about
it
it
was
made
and
signed
by
two
sauk
chiefs
one
fox
chief
and
one
warrior
when
the
annuities
were
delivered
to
the
sauk
and
fox
nations
of
indians
according
to
the
treaty
above
referred
to
amounting
to
per
annum
the
indians
always
thought
they
were
presents
as
the
annuity
for
the
first
twenty
years
was
always
paid
in
goods
sent
on
from
georgetown
district
of
columbia
and
poor
articles
of
merchandise
they
were
very
often
damaged
and
not
suitable
for
indians
until
i
as
their
agent
convinced
them
of
the
contrary
in
the
summer
of
when
the
indians
heard
that
the
goods
delivered
to
them
were
annuities
for
land
sold
by
them
to
the
united
states
they
were
astonished
and
refused
to
accept
of
the
goods
denying
that
they
ever
sold
the
lands
as
stated
by
me
their
agent
the
black
hawk
in
particular
who
was
present
at
the
time
made
a
great
noise
about
this
land
and
would
never
receive
any
part
of
the
annuities
from
that
time
forward
he
always
denied
the
authority
of
and
others
to
sell
any
part
of
their
lands
and
told
the
indians
not
to
receive
any
presents
or
annuities
from
any
american
otherwise
their
lands
would
be
claimed
at
some
future
day
as
the
united
states
do
insist
and
retain
the
lands
according
to
the
treaty
of
november
why
do
they
not
fulfil
part
of
that
treaty
as
equity
demands
the
sauk
and
fox
nations
are
allowed
according
to
that
treaty
live
and
hunt
on
the
lands
so
ceded
as
long
as
the
aforesaid
lands
belong
to
the
united
states
in
the
spring
of
the
year
about
twelve
or
fifteen
families
of
squatters
arrived
and
took
possession
of
the
sauk
village
near
the
mouth
of
the
rocky
river
they
immediately
commenced
destroying
the
indians
bark
boats
some
were
burned
others
were
torn
to
pieces
and
when
the
indians
arrived
at
the
village
and
found
fault
with
the
destruction
of
their
property
they
were
beaten
and
abused
by
the
squatters
the
indians
made
complaint
to
me
as
their
agent
i
wrote
to
general
clarke
stating
to
him
from
time
to
time
what
happened
and
giving
a
minute
detail
of
everything
that
passed
between
the
whites
squatters
and
the
indians
the
squatters
insisted
that
the
indians
should
be
removed
from
their
village
saying
that
as
soon
as
the
land
was
brought
into
market
they
the
squatters
would
buy
it
all
it
became
needless
for
me
to
show
them
the
treaty
and
the
right
the
indians
had
to
remain
on
their
lands
they
tried
every
method
to
annoy
the
indians
by
shooting
their
dogs
claiming
their
horses
complaining
that
the
indians
horses
broke
into
their
selling
them
whiskey
for
the
most
trifling
articles
contrary
to
the
wishes
and
request
of
the
chiefs
particularly
the
black
hawk
who
both
solicited
and
threatened
them
on
the
subject
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
president
directed
those
lands
to
be
sold
at
the
land
office
in
springfield
illinois
accordingly
when
the
time
came
that
they
were
to
be
offered
for
sale
in
the
autumn
of
there
were
about
twenty
families
of
squatters
at
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
old
sauk
village
most
of
whom
attended
the
sale
and
but
one
of
them
could
purchase
a
if
we
except
george
davenport
a
trader
who
resides
in
rocky
island
therefore
all
the
land
not
sold
still
belonged
to
the
united
states
and
the
indians
had
still
a
right
by
treaty
to
hunt
and
live
on
those
lands
this
right
however
was
not
allowed
them
they
must
move
off
in
the
principal
chiefs
and
others
of
the
sauk
and
fox
indians
who
resided
at
the
old
village
near
rocky
river
acquainted
me
that
they
would
remove
to
their
village
on
ihoway
river
these
chiefs
advised
me
to
write
to
general
clarke
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
at
this
place
louis
to
send
up
a
few
militia
that
the
black
hawk
and
his
followers
would
then
see
that
everything
was
in
earnest
and
they
would
remove
to
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
to
their
own
lands
the
letter
as
requested
by
the
chiefs
was
written
and
sent
by
me
to
general
clarke
but
he
did
not
think
proper
to
answer
it
therefore
everything
remained
as
formerly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
black
hawk
and
his
party
thought
the
whole
matter
of
removing
from
the
old
village
had
blown
over
in
the
spring
of
the
black
hawk
and
his
party
were
augmented
by
many
indians
from
ihoway
river
this
augmentation
of
forces
made
the
black
hawk
very
proud
and
he
supposed
nothing
would
be
done
about
removing
him
and
his
party
general
gaines
visited
the
black
hawk
and
his
party
this
season
with
a
force
of
regulars
and
militia
and
compelled
them
to
remove
to
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
river
on
their
own
lands
when
the
black
hawk
and
party
recrossed
to
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
river
in
they
numbered
three
hundred
and
men
they
were
hampered
with
many
women
and
children
and
had
no
intention
to
make
war
when
attacked
by
general
stillman
detachment
they
defended
themselves
like
men
and
i
would
ask
who
would
not
do
so
likewise
thus
the
war
commenced
the
indians
had
been
defeated
dispersed
and
some
of
the
principal
chiefs
are
now
in
prison
and
in
chains
at
jefferson
barracks
it
is
very
well
known
by
all
who
know
the
black
hawk
that
he
has
always
been
considered
a
friend
to
the
whites
often
has
he
taken
into
his
lodge
the
wearied
white
man
given
him
good
food
to
eat
and
a
good
blanket
to
sleep
on
before
the
fire
many
a
good
meal
has
given
to
people
travelling
past
his
village
and
very
many
stray
horses
has
he
recovered
from
the
indians
and
restored
to
their
rightful
owners
without
asking
any
recompense
whatever
what
right
have
we
to
tell
any
people
shall
not
cross
the
mississippi
river
on
any
pretext
whatever
when
the
sauk
and
fox
indians
wish
to
cross
the
mississippi
to
visit
their
relations
among
the
pottowattamies
of
fox
river
illinois
they
are
prevented
by
us
we
have
the
i
omit
the
old
gentleman
occasional
comments
upon
the
powers
that
dictated
and
the
forces
which
carried
on
the
warfare
of
this
unhappy
summer
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
had
his
suggestions
been
listened
to
and
had
he
continued
the
agent
of
the
sauks
and
foxes
a
sad
record
might
have
been
spared
we
should
assuredly
not
have
been
called
to
chronicle
the
untimely
fate
of
his
successor
the
unfortunate
vrain
who
a
comparative
stranger
to
his
people
was
murdered
by
them
in
their
exasperated
fury
at
kellogg
grove
soon
after
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
ii
it
seems
appropriate
to
notice
in
this
place
the
subsequent
appearance
before
the
public
of
one
of
the
personages
casually
mentioned
in
the
foregoing
narrative
in
the
autumn
of
we
saw
advertised
for
exhibition
at
wood
museum
chicago
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
longevity
on
record
the
venerable
joseph
crély
born
on
the
of
september
and
having
consequently
reached
at
this
date
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
years
sundry
particulars
followed
of
his
life
and
history
and
above
all
of
his
recollections
well
done
for
old
crély
said
my
husband
when
he
had
gone
through
the
long
array
come
let
us
go
over
to
wood
museum
and
renew
our
acquaintance
with
the
venerable
gentleman
i
did
not
need
a
second
invitation
for
i
was
curious
to
witness
the
wonders
which
the
whirligig
of
time
had
wrought
with
our
old
we
chose
an
early
hour
for
our
visit
that
we
might
pay
our
respects
to
both
him
and
the
granddaughter
who
had
him
in
charge
unembarrassed
by
the
presence
of
strangers
in
a
large
room
on
the
second
floor
of
the
building
among
cages
of
birds
and
animals
some
stuffed
others
still
living
we
perceived
seated
by
a
window
a
figure
clad
in
bright
cashmere
and
gay
tasselled
cap
tranquilly
smoking
a
or
long
indian
pipe
his
form
was
upright
his
face
florid
and
less
changed
than
might
have
been
expected
by
the
years
that
had
elapsed
since
we
had
last
seen
him
he
was
alone
and
my
husband
addressed
him
at
first
in
english
crély
do
you
remember
me
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
je
ne
comprends
pas
je
ne
me
ressouviens
de
rien
je
suis
vieux
vieux
le
treize
septembre
mil
sept
cent
je
suis
né
non
non
with
a
few
gentle
shakes
of
the
head
je
ne
puis
rappeler
rien
je
suis
vieux
vieux
my
husband
changed
his
inquiries
to
the
patois
which
crély
could
not
feign
not
to
comprehend
where
is
your
granddaughter
i
am
acquainted
with
her
and
would
like
to
speak
with
her
the
old
man
sprang
up
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
running
to
a
door
in
the
wooden
partition
which
cut
off
a
corner
of
the
room
and
thus
furnished
an
apartment
for
the
ancient
phenomenon
he
rapped
vigorously
and
called
in
accents
quite
unlike
his
former
feeble
drawling
tones
thérèse
thérèse
il
y
a
icite
un
monsieur
qui
voudrait

the
granddaughter
presently
made
her
appearance
she
looked
shyly
at
my
husband
from
under
her
brows
do
you
know
me
thérèse
he
asked
yes
sir
it
is
mr
kinzie
and
do
you
know
me
also
i
said
approaching
she
looked
at
me
and
shook
her
head
no
i
do
not
she
replied
what
thérèse
have
you
forgotten
madame
john
who
taught
you
to
read
you
and
all
the
little
girls
at
the
portage
oh
my
heavens
mrs
kinzie
but
you
have
changed
so
yes
thérèse
i
have
grown
old
in
all
these
years
but
i
have
not
grown
old
quite
so
fast
as
your
grandpapa
here
there
was
a
flash
in
her
eye
that
told
she
felt
my
meaning
she
hung
her
head
without
speaking
while
the
color
deepened
over
her
countenance
now
said
i
in
french
to
the
grandfather
you
remember
me
he
interrupted
me
with
a
protest
non
non
je
ne
puis
rappeler
rien
je
suis
vieux
vieux
le
treize
septembre
mil
sept
cent
je
suis
né
à
detroit
and
you
recollect
i
went
on
not
heeding
his
formula
how
i
came
to
the
portage
a
bride
and
lived
in
the
old
cabins
that
the
soldiers
had
occupied
eh
oui
oui
and
how
you
helped
make
the
garden
for
me
and
how
plante
and
manaigre
finished
the
new
house
so
nicely
while
monsieur
john
was
away
for
the
silver
and
how
there
was
a
feast
after
it
was
completed
ah
oui
oui
pour
le
sûr
and
where
are
all
our
people
now
i
asked
turning
to
thérèse
louis
frum
manaigre
is
he
living
oh
madame
kinzie
you
remember
that
manaigre
having
two
names
yes
thérèse
i
remember
everything
connected
with
those
old
times
at
the
portage
who
among
our
people
there
are
living
only
manaigre
is
left
she
said
mais
mais
thérèse
interposed
the
old
man
manaigre
daughter
geneviève
is
living
it
was
a
comfort
to
find
our
visit
of
such
miraculous
benefit
to
his
memory
and
the
puans
are
any
of
them
left
i
asked
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
i
think
again
her
grandfather
promptly
contradicted
her
mais
mais
je
compte
y
en
a
quinze
ou
seize
thérèse
and
he
went
quite
glibly
over
the
names
of
such
of
his
red
friends
as
still
hovered
around
their
old
home
in
that
vicinity
he
was
in
the
full
tide
of
gay
reminiscence
touching
upon
experiences
and
adventures
of
long
ago
and
recalling
indian
and
acquaintances
of
former
days
when
footsteps
approached
and
the
entrance
of
eager
curious
visitors
suddenly
reminded
him
of
his
appointed
rôle
it
was
marvellous
how
instantaneously
he
subsided
into
the
superannuated
driveller
who
was
to
bear
away
the
bell
from
old
parr
and
all

alexander

not
another
phrase
could
all
the
king
armies
or
all
the
king
men
have
extorted
from
him
so
we
left
him
to
the
admiring
comments
of
the
i
think
it
should
be
added
in
extenuation
of
what
would
otherwise
seem
a
gross
imposture
that
his
granddaughter
was
really
ignorant
of
crély
exact
age
that
he
being
ever
a
gasconading
fellow
was
quite
ready
to
personate
that
certain
joseph
crély
whose
name
appears
on
the
baptismal
records
of
the
church
in
detroit
of
the
year
he
was
moreover
pleased
with
the
idea
of
being
gaily
dressed
and
going
on
a
tour
to
see
the
world
and
doubtless
rejoiced
also
in
the
prospect
of
relieving
his
poor
granddaughter
of
a
part
of
the
burden
of
his
maintenance
he
was
probably
at
this
time
about
years
of
age
there
are
those
that
knew
him
from
who
maintain
that
his
age
was
a
few
years
less
but
i
take
the
estimate
of
kinzie
and
dousman
of
prairie

who
set
him
down
in
at
about
the
