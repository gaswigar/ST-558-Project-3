the

prologue
upon
an
evening
after
a
long
and
tiring
trek
i
arrived
at
dreamdorp
the
local
atmosphere
combined
with
a
heavy
meal
are
responsible
for
the
following
nightmare
consisting
of
a
series
of
dreams
to
make
the
sequence
of
the
whole
intelligible
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
though
the
scene
of
each
vision
was
the
same
yet
by
some
curious
mental
process
i
had
no
recollection
of
the
place
whatsoever
in
each
dream
the
locality
was
totally
new
to
me
and
i
had
an
entirely
fresh
detachment
thus
i
had
not
the
great
advantage
of
working
over
familiar
ground
one
thing
and
one
only
was
carried
on
from
dream
to
dream
and
that
was
the
vivid
recollection
of
the
general
lessons
previously
learnt
these
finally
produced
success
the
whole
series
of
dreams
however
remained
in
my
memory
as
a
connected
whole
when
i
awoke
first
dream
any
fool
can
get
into
a
hole
chinese
if
left
to
you
for
defence
make
spades
i
felt
lonely
and
not
a
little
sad
as
i
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
river
near
duffer
drift
and
watched
the
red
dust
haze
raised
by
the
southward
departing
column
in
the
distance
turn
slowly
into
gold
as
it
hung
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
it
was
just
three
and
here
i
was
on
the
banks
of
the
silliaasvogel
river
left
behind
by
my
column
with
a
party
of
fifty
and
men
to
hold
the
drift
it
was
an
important
ford
because
it
was
the
only
one
across
which
wheeled
traffic
could
pass
for
some
miles
up
or
down
the
river
illustration
map
of
duffer
drift
the
river
was
a
sluggish
stream
not
now
in
flood
crawling
along
at
the
very
bottom
of
its
bed
between
steep
banks
which
were
almost
vertical
or
at
any
rate
too
steep
for
wagons
everywhere
except
at
the
drift
itself
the
banks
from
the
river
edge
to
their
tops
and
some
distance
outwards
were
covered
with
dense
thorn
and
other
bushes
which
formed
a
screen
impenetrable
to
the
sight
they
were
also
broken
by
small
ravines
and
holes
where
the
earth
had
been
eaten
away
by
the
river
when
in
flood
and
were
consequently
very
rough
some
two
thousand
odd
yards
north
of
the
drift
was
a
rocky
mountain
and
about
a
mile
to
the
northeast
appeared
the
usual
kopje
covered
with
bushes
and
boulders
steep
on
the
south
but
gently
falling
to
the
north
this
had
a
farm
on
the
near
side
of
it
about
a
thousand
yards
south
of
the
drift
was
a
convex
and
smooth
hill
somewhat
like
an
inverted
basin
sparsely
sown
with
small
boulders
and
with
a
kaffir
kraal
consisting
of
a
few
grass
and
mud
huts
on
top
between
the
river
and
the
hills
on
the
north
the
ground
consisted
of
open
and
almost
level
veldt
on
the
south
bank
the
veldt
was
more
undulating
and
equally
open
the
whole
place
was
covered
with
my
orders
were
to
hold
duffer
drift
at
all
costs
that
i
should
probably
be
visited
by
some
column
within
three
or
four
days
time
that
i
might
possibly
be
attacked
before
that
time
but
that
this
was
very
unlikely
as
no
enemy
were
known
to
be
within
a
hundred
miles
that
the
enemy
had
guns
it
all
seemed
plain
enough
except
that
the
true
inwardness
of
the
last
piece
of
information
did
not
strike
me
at
the
time
though
in
company
with
fifty
good
men
and
true
it
certainly
made
me
feel
somewhat
lonely
and
marooned
to
be
left
out
there
comparatively
alone
on
the
boundless
veldt
but
the
chance
of
an
attack
filled
me
and
i
am
quite
sure
my
men
with
martial
ardor
and
at
last
here
was
the
chance
i
had
so
often
longed
for
this
was
my
first
show
my
first
independent
command
and
i
was
determined
to
carry
out
my
orders
to
the
bitter
end
i
was
young
and
inexperienced
it
is
true
but
i
had
passed
all
my
examinations
with
fair
success
my
men
were
a
good
willing
lot
with
the
traditions
of
a
glorious
regiment
to
uphold
and
would
i
knew
do
all
i
should
require
of
them
we
were
also
well
supplied
with
ammunition
and
rations
and
had
a
number
of
picks
shovels
and
sandbags
which
i
confess
had
been
rather
forced
on
me
as
i
turned
towards
my
gallant
little
detachment
visions
of
a
bloody
and
desperate
fight
crossed
my
mind
a
fight
to
the
last
cartridge
and
then
an
appeal
to
cold
steel
with
ultimate
victory
and
but
a
discreet
cough
at
my
elbow
brought
me
back
to
realities
and
warned
me
that
my
was
waiting
for
orders
after
a
moment
consideration
i
decided
to
pitch
my
small
camp
on
a
spot
just
south
of
the
drift
because
it
was
slightly
rising
ground
which
i
knew
should
be
chosen
for
a
camp
whenever
possible
it
was
moreover
quite
close
to
the
drift
which
was
also
in
its
favor
for
as
everyone
knows
if
you
are
told
off
to
guard
anything
you
mount
a
guard
quite
close
to
it
and
place
a
sentry
if
possible
standing
on
top
of
it
the
place
picked
out
by
me
also
had
the
river
circling
round
three
sides
of
it
in
a
regular
horseshoe
bend
which
formed
a
kind
of
ditch
or
as
the
book
says
a
natural
obstacle
i
was
indeed
lucky
to
have
such
an
ideal
place
close
at
hand
nothing
could
have
been
more
suitable
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
the
enemy
were
not
within
a
hundred
miles
there
would
be
no
need
to
place
the
camp
in
a
state
of
defence
till
the
following
day
besides
the
men
were
tired
after
their
long
trek
and
it
would
be
quite
as
much
as
they
could
do
comfortably
to
arrange
nice
and
shipshape
all
the
stores
and
tools
which
had
been
dumped
down
anyhow
in
a
heap
pitch
the
camp
and
get
their
teas
before
dark
between
you
and
me
i
was
really
relieved
to
be
able
to
put
off
my
defensive
measures
till
the
morrow
because
i
was
a
wee
bit
puzzled
as
to
what
to
do
in
fact
the
more
i
thought
the
more
puzzled
i
grew
the
only
measures
of
defence
i
could
recall
for
the
moment
were
how
to
tie
a
thumb
or
overhand
knot
and
how
long
it
takes
to
cut
down
an
apple
tree
of
six
inches
diameter
unluckily
neither
of
these
useful
facts
seemed
quite
to
apply
now
if
they
had
given
me
a
job
like
fighting
the
battle
of
waterloo
or
sedan
or
bull
run
i
knew
all
about
that
as
i
had
crammed
it
up
and
been
examined
in
it
too
i
also
knew
how
to
take
up
a
position
for
a
division
or
even
an
army
corps
but
the
stupid
little
subaltern
game
of
the
defence
of
a
drift
with
a
small
detachment
was
curiously
enough
most
perplexing
i
had
never
really
considered
such
a
thing
however
in
the
light
of
my
habitual
dealings
with
army
corps
it
would
no
doubt
be
after
a
little
thought
having
issued
my
immediate
orders
accordingly
i
decided
to
explore
the
neighborhood
but
was
for
a
moment
puzzled
as
to
which
direction
i
should
take
for
having
no
horse
i
could
not
possibly
get
all
round
before
dark
after
a
little
thought
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
obviously
i
should
go
to
the
north
the
bulk
of
the
enemy
being
away
to
the
north
that
of
course
must
be
the
i
knew
naturally
that
there
must
be
a
front
because
in
all
the
schemes
i
had
had
to
prepare
or
the
exams
i
had
undergone
there
was
always
a
front
or
the
place
where
the
enemies
come
from
how
often
also
had
i
not
had
trouble
in
getting
out
of
a
dull
sentry
which
his
front
and
what
his
beat
was
the
north
then
being
my
front
the
east
and
west
were
my
flanks
where
there
might
possibly
be
enemies
and
the
south
was
my
where
naturally
there
were
none
i
settled
these
knotty
points
to
my
satisfaction
and
off
i
trudged
with
my
and
of
course
my
kodak
directing
my
steps
towards
the
dutch
farm
with
gleaming
white
walls
nestling
under
the
kopje
to
the
northeast
it
was
quite
a
snug
little
farm
for
south
africa
surrounded
by
blue
gums
and
fruit
trees
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
farm
i
was
met
by
the
owner
andreas
brink
a
tame
or
surrendered
boer
farmer
and
his
two
sons
piet
and
gert
such
a
nice
man
too
with
a
pleasant
face
and
long
beard
he
would
insist
on
calling
me
captain
and
as
any
correction
might
have
confused
him
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
make
any
and
after
all
i
was
so
very
far
from
my
company
the
three
of
them
positively
bristled
with
and
dirty
passes
from
every
provost
marshal
in
south
africa
which
they
insisted
on
showing
me
i
had
not
thought
of
asking
for
them
and
was
much
impressed
to
have
so
many
they
must
be
special
men
they
escorted
me
to
the
farm
where
the
guid
wife
and
several
daughters
met
us
and
gave
me
a
drink
of
milk
which
was
most
acceptable
after
my
long
and
dusty
trek
the
whole
family
appeared
either
to
speak
or
to
understand
english
and
we
had
a
very
friendly
chat
during
the
course
of
which
i
gathered
that
there
were
no
boer
commandoes
anywhere
within
miles
that
the
whole
family
cordially
hoped
that
there
never
would
be
again
and
that
brink
was
really
a
most
loyal
briton
and
had
been
much
against
the
war
but
had
been
forced
to
go
on
commando
with
his
two
sons
their
loyalty
was
evident
because
there
was
an
oleograph
of
the
queen
on
the
wall
and
one
of
the
numerous
flappers
was
playing
our
national
anthem
on
the
harmonium
as
i
entered
the
farmer
and
the
boys
took
a
great
interest
in
all
my
personal
gear
especially
a
pair
of
which
they
tried
with
much
delight
and
many
exclamations
of
allermachtig
they
evidently
appreciated
them
extremely
but
could
not
imagine
any
use
for
my
kodak
in
even
after
i
had
taken
a
family
group
funny
simple
fellows
they
asked
and
got
permission
from
me
to
sell
milk
eggs
and
butter
in
the
camp
and
i
strolled
on
my
way
congratulating
myself
on
the
good
turn
i
was
thus
able
to
do
myself
and
detachment
none
of
whom
had
even
smelt
such
luxuries
for
weeks
after
an
uneventful
round
i
directed
my
steps
back
towards
the
thin
blue
threads
of
smoke
rising
vertically
in
the
still
air
which
alone
showed
the
position
of
my
little
post
and
as
i
walked
the
peacefulness
of
the
whole
scene
impressed
me
the
landscape
lay
bathed
in
the
warm
light
of
the
setting
sun
whose
parting
rays
tinged
most
strongly
the
various
heights
within
view
and
the
hush
of
approaching
evening
was
only
broken
by
the
distant
lowing
of
oxen
and
by
the
indistinct
and
cheerful
hum
of
the
camp
which
gradually
grew
louder
as
i
approached
i
strolled
along
in
quite
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
meditating
over
the
rather
curious
names
which
mr
brink
had
given
me
for
the
surrounding
features
of
the
landscape
the
kopje
above
his
farm
was
called
incidentamba
the
mountain
some
two
miles
to
the
north
was
called
regret
table
mountain
and
the
gently
rising
hill
close
to
the
drift
on
the
south
of
the
river
was
called
waschout
hill
everything
was
going
on
well
and
the
men
were
at
their
teas
when
i
got
back
the
nice
dutchman
with
his
apostolic
face
and
the
lanky
piet
and
gert
were
already
there
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
men
to
whom
they
were
selling
their
wares
at
exorbitant
rates
the
three
of
them
strolled
about
the
camp
showing
great
interest
in
everything
asking
most
intelligent
questions
about
the
british
forces
and
the
general
position
of
affairs
and
seemed
really
relieved
to
have
a
strong
british
post
near
they
did
not
even
take
offence
when
some
of
the
rougher
men
called
them
blarsted
dutchmen
and
refused
to
converse
with
them
or
buy
their
skoff
about
dusk
they
left
with
many
promises
to
return
with
a
fresh
supply
on
the
morrow
after
writing
out
my
orders
for
next
day
one
of
which
was
for
digging
some
trenches
round
the
camp
an
operation
which
i
knew
my
men
as
becomes
good
british
soldiers
disliked
very
much
and
regarded
as
fatigues
i
saw
the
two
guards
mounted
one
at
the
drift
and
the
other
some
little
way
down
the
river
each
furnishing
one
sentry
on
the
river
bank
when
all
had
turned
in
and
the
camp
was
quite
silent
it
was
almost
comforting
to
hear
the
cry
of
the
sentries
number
one
all
is
well
number
two
all
is
well
by
this
sound
i
was
able
to
locate
them
and
knew
they
were
at
their
proper
posts
on
going
round
sentries
about
midnight
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
they
were
both
alert
and
that
as
it
was
a
cold
night
each
guard
had
built
a
bonfire
silhouetted
in
the
cheerful
blaze
of
which
stood
the
sentry
a
monument
to
all
round
that
here
was
a
british
sentry
fully
on
the
after
impressing
them
with
their
orders
the
extent
of
their
beat
and
the
direction
of
their
front
i
turned
in
the
fires
they
had
built
besides
being
a
comfort
to
themselves
were
also
useful
to
me
because
twice
during
the
night
when
i
looked
out
i
could
without
leaving
my
tent
plainly
see
them
at
their
posts
i
finally
fell
asleep
and
dreamt
of
being
decorated
with
a
crossbelt
made
of
and
and
of
wearing
red
tabs
all
down
my
back
i
was
suddenly
awoken
about
the
grey
of
dawn
by
a
hoarse
cry
halt
who
goes
cut
short
by
the
unmistakable
of
a
mauser
rifle
before
i
was
off
my
valise
the
reports
of
mausers
rang
around
the
camp
from
every
side
these
mingled
with
the
smack
of
the
bullets
as
they
hit
the
ground
and
stripped
the
zipzip
of
the
leaden
hail
through
the
tents
and
the
curses
and
groans
of
men
who
were
hit
as
they
lay
or
stumbled
about
trying
to
get
out
made
a
hellish
din
there
was
some
wild
shooting
in
return
from
my
men
but
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
and
as
i
managed
to
wriggle
out
of
my
tent
the
whole
place
was
swarming
with
bearded
men
shooting
into
the
heaving
canvas
at
that
moment
i
must
have
been
clubbed
on
the
head
for
i
knew
no
more
until
i
found
myself
seated
on
an
empty
case
having
my
head
which
was
dripping
with
blood
tied
up
by
one
of
my
men
our
losses
were
ten
men
killed
including
both
sentries
and
wounded
the
boers
one
killed
and
two
wounded
later
on
as
at
the
order
of
the
not
but
very
frowzy
boer
commandant
i
was
gloomily
taking
off
the
saucy
warm
spotted
waistcoat
knitted
for
me
by
my
sister
i
noticed
our
friends
of
the
previous
evening
in
very
animated
and
friendly
conversation
with
the
burghers
and
pappa
was
curiously
enough
carrying
a
rifle
and
bandolier
and
my
new
he
was
laughing
and
pointing
towards
something
lying
on
the
ground
through
which
he
finally
put
his
foot
this
to
my
horror
i
recognized
as
my
unhappy
camera
here
i
suppose
my
mind
must
have
slightly
wandered
for
i
found
myself
repeating
some
latin
lines
once
my
favorite
imposition
but
forgotten
since
my
timeo
danaos
et
dona
ferentes
when
suddenly
the
voice
of
the
field
cornet
broke
into
my
musing
with
your
breeches
too
captain
trekking
all
that
day
on
foot
sockless
and
in
the
boots
of
another
i
had
much
to
think
of
besides
my
throbbing
head
the
sight
of
the
long
boer
convoy
with
guns
which
had
succeeded
so
easily
in
crossing
the
drift
was
to
have
held
was
a
continual
reminder
of
my
failure
and
of
my
responsibility
for
the
dreadful
losses
to
my
poor
detachment
i
gradually
gathered
from
the
boers
what
i
had
already
partially
guessed
namely
that
they
had
been
fetched
and
guided
all
round
our
camp
by
friend
brink
had
surrounded
it
in
the
dark
crawling
about
in
the
bush
on
the
river
bank
and
had
carefully
marked
down
our
two
poor
sentries
these
they
had
at
once
shot
on
the
alarm
being
given
and
had
then
rushed
the
camp
from
the
dense
cover
on
three
sides
towards
evening
my
head
got
worse
and
its
rhythmic
throbbing
seemed
gradually
to
take
a
meaning
and
hammered
out
the
following
lessons
the
result
of
much
pondering
on
my
failure
do
not
put
off
taking
your
measures
of
defence
till
the
morrow
as
this
is
more
important
than
the
comfort
of
your
men
or
the
shipshape
arrangement
of
your
camp
choose
the
position
of
your
camp
mainly
with
reference
to
your
defence
do
not
in
show
stray
men
of
the
enemy
breed
all
over
your
camp
be
they
never
so
kind
and
full
of
butter
and
do
not
be
hypnotized
by
numerous
passes
at
once
to
confide
in
them
do
not
let
your
sentries
advertise
their
position
to
the
whole
world
including
the
enemy
by
standing
in
the
full
glare
of
a
fire
and
making
much
noise
every
half
hour
do
not
if
avoidable
be
in
tents
when
bullets
are
ripping
through
them
at
such
times
a
hole
in
the
ground
is
worth
many
tents
after
these
lessons
had
been
dinned
into
my
soul
millions
and
millions
of
times
so
that
i
could
never
forget
them
a
strange
thing
came
to
pass
there
was
a
kaleidoscopic
change
i
had
another
dream
second
dream
and
what
did
ye
look
they
should
compass
warcraft
learnt
in
a
breath
knowledge
unto
occasion
at
the
first
far
view
of
death
kipling
i
suddenly
found
myself
dumped
down
at
duffer
drift
with
the
same
orders
as
already
detailed
and
an
equal
detachment
composed
of
entirely
different
men
as
before
and
on
every
subsequent
occasion
i
had
ample
stores
ammunition
and
tools
my
position
was
precisely
similar
to
my
former
one
with
this
important
exception
running
through
my
brain
were
lessons
as
soon
as
i
received
my
orders
therefore
i
began
to
make
out
my
plan
of
operations
without
wasting
any
time
over
the
landscape
the
setting
sun
or
the
departing
column
which
having
all
our
stores
soon
vanished
i
was
determined
to
carry
out
all
the
lessons
i
had
learnt
as
well
as
i
knew
how
to
prevent
any
strangers
friendly
or
otherwise
from
coming
into
my
position
and
spying
out
the
elaborate
defences
i
was
going
to
make
i
sent
out
at
once
two
examining
posts
of
one
and
three
men
each
one
to
the
top
of
waschout
hill
and
the
other
some
yards
out
on
the
veldt
to
the
north
of
the
drift
their
orders
were
to
watch
the
surrounding
country
and
give
the
alarm
in
the
event
of
the
approach
of
any
body
of
men
whatever
boers
were
of
course
improbable
but
still
just
possible
and
also
to
stop
any
individuals
friendly
or
not
from
coming
anywhere
near
camp
and
to
shoot
at
once
on
with
the
order
to
halt
if
the
had
any
provisions
to
sell
these
were
to
be
sent
in
with
a
list
by
one
of
the
guard
who
would
return
with
the
money
but
the
strangers
were
not
to
be
allowed
nearer
the
camp
on
any
account
having
thus
arranged
a
safeguard
against
spies
i
proceeded
to
choose
a
i
chose
the
site
already
described
in
my
former
dream
and
for
the
same
reasons
which
still
appealed
to
me
so
long
as
i
was
entrenched
it
appeared
the
best
place
around
we
started
making
our
trenches
as
soon
as
i
had
marked
off
a
nice
squarish
little
enclosure
which
would
about
contain
our
small
camp
though
of
course
the
north
was
the
front
i
thought
having
a
camp
it
would
be
best
to
have
an
defence
as
a
sort
of
obstacle
the
majority
of
the
men
were
told
off
to
dig
which
they
did
not
relish
a
few
being
detailed
to
pitch
camp
and
prepare
tea
as
the
length
of
trench
was
rather
great
for
the
available
number
of
diggers
and
the
soil
was
hard
we
were
only
able
by
dark
by
which
time
the
men
were
quite
done
up
by
their
hard
day
to
make
quite
a
low
parapet
and
shallow
trench
still
we
were
entrenched
which
was
the
great
thing
and
the
trench
was
all
round
our
camp
so
we
were
well
prepared
even
should
we
be
attacked
during
the
night
or
early
next
morning
which
was
out
of
the
question
during
this
time
one
or
two
strangers
had
approached
the
guard
of
the
north
from
a
farm
under
incidentamba
as
they
had
eggs
and
butter
to
sell
these
were
brought
in
as
arranged
for
the
man
sent
in
with
the
stuff
reported
that
the
elder
of
the
dutchmen
was
a
most
pleasant
man
and
had
sent
me
a
present
of
a
pat
of
butter
and
some
eggs
with
his
compliments
and
would
i
allow
him
to
come
in
and
speak
to
me
however
not
being
such
a
fool
as
to
allow
him
in
my
defences
i
went
out
instead
in
case
he
had
any
information
his
only
information
was
that
there
were
no
boers
anywhere
near
he
was
an
old
man
but
though
he
had
a
museum
of
passes
i
was
not
to
be
chloroformed
by
them
into
confidence
as
he
seemed
friendly
and
possibly
loyal
i
walked
part
of
the
way
back
to
his
farm
with
him
in
order
to
look
around
at
dark
the
two
examining
posts
came
in
and
two
guards
were
mounted
close
by
the
object
i
was
to
watch
namely
the
drift
at
the
same
places
as
in
my
previous
dream
this
time
however
there
was
no
shouting
nor
were
there
any
fires
and
the
sentries
had
orders
not
to
challenge
but
to
shoot
any
person
they
might
see
outside
camp
at
once
they
were
placed
standing
down
the
river
bank
just
high
enough
to
see
over
the
top
and
were
thus
not
unnecessarily
exposed
teas
had
been
eaten
and
all
fires
put
out
at
dusk
and
after
dark
all
turned
in
but
in
the
trenches
instead
of
in
tents
after
going
round
sentries
to
see
everything
snug
for
the
night
i
lay
down
myself
with
a
sense
of
having
done
my
duty
and
neglected
no
possible
precaution
for
our
safety
just
before
dawn
much
the
same
happened
as
already
described
in
my
first
dream
except
that
the
ball
was
started
by
a
shot
without
challenge
from
one
of
our
sentries
at
something
moving
among
the
bush
which
resulted
in
close
range
fire
opening
onto
us
from
all
sides
this
time
we
were
not
rushed
but
a
perfect
hail
of
bullets
whistled
in
from
every
direction
from
in
front
of
each
trench
along
each
trench
and
from
behind
each
trench
and
over
and
through
our
parapet
it
was
sufficient
to
put
a
hand
or
head
up
to
have
a
dozen
bullets
through
and
all
round
it
and
the
strange
part
was
we
saw
no
one
as
the
detachment
wag
plaintively
remarked
we
could
have
seen
lots
of
boers
if
was
for
the
bushes
in
between
after
vainly
trying
until
bright
daylight
to
see
the
enemy
in
order
to
do
some
damage
in
return
so
many
men
were
hit
and
the
position
seemed
so
utterly
hopeless
that
i
had
to
hoist
the
white
flag
we
had
by
then
men
killed
and
six
wounded
as
soon
as
the
white
flag
went
up
the
boers
ceased
firing
at
once
and
stood
up
every
bush
and
up
to
yards
range
seemed
to
have
hid
a
boer
behind
it
this
close
range
explained
the
marvelous
accuracy
of
their
shooting
and
the
great
proportion
of
our
killed
who
were
nearly
all
shot
through
the
head
to
our
wounded
as
we
were
collecting
ourselves
preparatory
to
marching
off
there
were
one
or
two
things
which
struck
me
one
was
that
the
dutchman
who
had
presented
me
with
eggs
and
butter
was
in
earnest
confabulation
with
the
boer
commandant
who
was
calling
him
oom
most
affectionately
i
also
noticed
that
all
the
male
kaffirs
from
the
neighboring
kraal
had
been
fetched
and
impressed
to
assist
in
getting
the
boer
guns
and
wagons
across
the
drift
and
to
load
up
our
captured
gear
and
generally
do
odd
and
dirty
jobs
these
same
kaffirs
did
their
work
with
amazing
alacrity
and
looked
as
if
they
enjoyed
it
there
was
no
backchat
when
an
order
was
given
usually
by
friend
oom
again
as
i
trudged
with
blistered
feet
that
livelong
day
did
i
think
over
my
failure
it
seemed
so
strange
i
had
done
all
i
knew
and
yet
here
we
were
ignominiously
captured
of
us
killed
and
the
boers
over
the
drift
ah
my
boy
i
thought
there
must
be
a
few
more
lessons
to
be
learnt
besides
those
you
already
know
and
in
order
to
find
out
what
these
were
i
pondered
deeply
over
the
details
of
the
fight
how
the
boers
must
have
known
of
our
position
and
how
they
had
managed
to
get
close
up
all
round
within
snapshooting
range
without
being
discovered
what
a
tremendous
advantage
they
had
had
in
shooting
from
among
the
bushes
on
the
bank
where
they
could
not
be
seen
over
us
who
had
to
show
up
over
a
parapet
every
time
we
looked
for
an
enemy
and
show
up
moreover
just
in
the
very
place
where
every
boer
expected
us
to
and
was
watching
there
seemed
to
be
some
fault
in
the
position
how
the
bullets
seemed
sometimes
to
come
through
the
parapet
and
how
those
that
passed
over
one
side
hit
the
men
defending
the
other
side
in
the
back
how
on
the
whole
that
natural
obstacle
the
river
bed
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
disadvantage
than
a
protection
eventually
the
following
lessons
framed
themselves
in
my
head
some
of
them
quite
new
some
of
them
supplementing
those
four
i
had
already
learnt
with
modern
rifles
to
guard
a
drift
or
locality
does
necessitate
sitting
on
top
of
it
as
if
it
could
be
picked
up
and
carried
away
unless
the
locality
is
suitable
to
hold
for
other
and
defensive
reasons
it
may
even
be
much
better
to
take
up
your
defensive
position
some
way
from
the
spot
and
so
away
from
concealed
ground
which
enables
the
enemy
to
crawl
up
to
very
close
range
concealed
and
unperceived
and
to
fire
from
cover
which
hides
them
even
when
shooting
it
would
be
better
if
possible
to
have
the
enemy
in
the
open
or
to
have
what
is
called
a
clear
field
of
fire
a
proof
parapet
or
shelter
which
is
visible
serves
merely
to
attract
bullets
instead
of
keeping
them
out
the
can
be
easily
tested
practically
when
fired
at
by
an
enemy
at
close
range
from
nearly
all
round
a
low
parapet
and
shallow
trench
are
not
of
much
use
as
what
bullets
do
not
hit
the
defenders
on
one
side
hit
those
on
another
it
is
enough
to
keep
strange
men
of
the
enemy
breed
away
from
your
actual
defences
letting
them
go
free
to
warn
their
friends
of
your
existence
and
whereabouts
even
though
they
do
not
know
the
details
of
your
defences
it
would
be
very
much
better
to
gather
in
all
such
strangers
and
kindly
but
firmly
to
take
care
of
them
so
that
they
should
not
be
under
temptation
to
impart
any
knowledge
they
may
have
obtained
another
way
as
the
cookery
book
says
more
economical
in
lives
would
be
as
follows
gather
and
warmly
greet
a
sufficiency
of
strangers
stuff
well
with
chestnuts
as
to
the
large
force
about
to
join
you
in
a
few
hours
garnish
with
corroborative
detail
and
season
according
to
taste
with
whiskey
or
tobacco
this
will
very
likely
be
sufficient
for
the
nearest
commando
probable
cost
some
heavy
and
glib
lying
but
no
lives
will
be
expended
it
is
not
business
to
allow
lazy
black
men
even
though
they
be
brothers
and
neutrals
to
sit
and
pick
their
teeth
outside
their
kraals
whilst
tired
white
men
are
breaking
their
hearts
trying
to
do
heavy
labor
in
short
time
it
is
more
the
duty
of
a
christian
soldier
to
teach
the
dusky
neutral
the
dignity
of
labor
and
to
keep
him
under
guard
to
prevent
his
going
away
to
talk
about
it
by
the
time
the
above
lessons
had
been
well
burnt
into
my
brain
beyond
all
chance
of
forgetfulness
a
strange
thing
happened
i
had
a
fresh
dream
third
dream
so
when
we
take
tea
with
a
few
guns
o
course
you
will
know
what
to
do
hoo
hoo
kipling
i
was
at
duffer
drift
on
a
similar
sunny
afternoon
and
under
precisely
similar
conditions
except
that
i
now
had
lessons
running
through
my
mind
i
at
once
sent
out
two
patrols
each
of
one
and
three
men
one
to
the
north
and
one
to
the
south
they
were
to
visit
all
neighboring
farms
and
kraals
and
bring
in
all
dutchmen
and
boys
and
male
kaffirs
by
persuasion
if
possible
but
by
force
if
necessary
this
would
prevent
the
news
of
our
arrival
being
carried
around
to
any
adjacent
commandoes
and
would
also
assist
to
solve
the
labor
question
a
small
guard
was
mounted
on
the
top
of
waschout
hill
as
a
i
decided
that
as
the
drift
could
not
get
up
and
run
away
it
was
not
necessary
to
take
up
my
post
or
position
quite
close
to
it
especially
as
such
a
position
would
be
under
close
rifle
fire
from
the
river
bank
to
which
the
approaches
were
quite
concealed
and
which
gave
excellent
cover
the
very
worst
place
for
such
a
position
seemed
to
be
anywhere
within
the
horseshoe
bend
of
the
river
as
this
would
allow
an
enemy
practically
to
surround
it
my
choice
therefore
fell
on
a
spot
to
which
the
ground
gently
rose
from
the
river
bank
some
to
yards
south
of
the
drift
here
i
arranged
to
dig
a
trench
roughly
facing
the
front
north
which
thus
would
have
about
yards
clear
ground
on
its
front
we
started
to
make
a
trench
about
fifty
yards
long
for
my
fifty
men
according
to
the
usual
rule
some
little
time
after
beginning
the
patrols
came
in
having
collected
three
dutchmen
and
two
boys
and
about
thirteen
kaffirs
the
former
the
leader
of
whom
seemed
a
man
of
education
and
some
importance
were
at
first
inclined
to
protest
when
they
were
given
tools
to
dig
trenches
for
themselves
showed
bundles
of
passes
and
talked
very
big
about
complaining
to
the
general
and
even
as
to
a
question
in
the
house
about
our
brutality
this
momentarily
staggered
me
as
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
might
happen
to
poor
if
the
member
for
upper
tooting
should
raise
the
point
but
westminster
was
far
away
and
i
hardened
my
heart
finally
they
had
the
humor
to
see
the
force
of
the
argument
that
it
was
after
all
necessary
for
their
own
health
as
they
would
otherwise
be
out
in
the
open
veldt
should
the
post
be
attacked
the
kaffirs
served
as
a
welcome
relief
to
my
men
as
they
got
tired
they
also
dug
a
separate
hole
for
themselves
on
one
side
of
and
behind
our
trench
in
a
small
ravine
by
evening
we
had
quite
a
decent
trench
dug
the
parapet
was
about
two
feet
six
inches
thick
at
the
top
and
was
quite
as
i
tested
it
our
trench
was
not
all
in
one
straight
line
but
in
two
portions
broken
back
at
a
slight
angle
so
as
to
get
a
more
divergent
fire
rather
cunning
of
me
though
each
half
was
of
course
as
straight
as
i
could
get
it
it
was
astonishing
what
difficulty
i
had
to
get
the
men
to
dig
in
a
nice
straight
line
i
was
particular
as
to
this
point
because
i
once
heard
a
certain
captain
severely
told
off
at
manoeuvres
by
a
very
senior
officer
for
having
his
trenches
out
of
dressing
no
one
could
tell
whether
some
brass
hat
might
not
come
around
and
inspect
us
next
day
so
it
was
as
well
to
be
prepared
for
anything
at
dusk
the
guard
on
waschout
hill
for
whom
a
trench
had
also
been
dug
was
relieved
and
increased
to
six
men
and
after
teas
and
giving
out
the
orders
for
the
next
day
we
all
turned
in
in
our
trenches
the
tents
were
not
pitched
as
we
were
not
going
to
occupy
them
and
it
was
no
good
merely
showing
up
our
position
a
guard
was
mounted
over
our
prisoners
or
rather
guests
and
furnished
one
sentry
to
watch
over
them
before
falling
asleep
i
ran
over
my
seven
lessons
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
left
nothing
undone
which
could
possibly
help
towards
success
we
were
entrenched
had
a
good
defence
all
our
rations
and
ammunition
close
at
hand
in
the
trenches
and
filled
it
was
with
a
contented
feeling
of
having
done
everything
right
and
of
being
quite
the
little
boy
that
i
gradually
dozed
off
next
morning
dawned
brightly
and
uneventfully
and
we
had
about
an
hour
work
improving
details
of
our
trenches
before
breakfasts
were
ready
just
as
breakfast
was
over
the
sentry
on
waschout
hill
reported
a
cloud
of
dust
away
to
the
north
by
regret
table
mountain
this
was
caused
by
a
large
party
of
men
mounted
with
wheeled
transport
of
some
sort
they
were
most
probably
the
enemy
and
seemed
to
be
trekking
in
all
innocence
of
our
presence
for
the
drift
what
a
scoop
i
thought
if
they
come
on
quite
unsuspecting
and
cross
the
drift
in
a
lump
without
discerning
our
position
i
shall
lie
low
let
the
advanced
party
go
past
without
a
shot
and
wait
until
the
main
body
gets
over
this
side
within
close
range
and
then
open
magazine
fire
into
the
thick
of
them
yes
it
will
be
just
when
they
reach
that
broken
about
yards
away
that
i
shall
give
the
word
fire
however
it
was
not
to
be
after
a
short
time
the
enemy
halted
apparently
for
consideration
the
advanced
men
seemed
to
have
a
consultation
and
then
gradually
approached
incidentamba
farm
with
much
caution
two
or
three
women
ran
out
and
waved
whereupon
these
men
galloped
up
to
the
farm
at
once
what
passed
of
course
we
could
not
tell
but
evidently
the
women
gave
information
as
to
our
arrival
and
position
because
the
effect
was
electrical
the
advanced
boers
split
up
into
two
main
parties
one
riding
towards
the
river
a
long
way
to
the
east
and
another
going
similarly
to
the
west
one
man
galloped
back
with
the
information
obtained
to
the
main
body
which
became
all
bustle
and
started
off
with
their
wagons
behind
incidentamba
when
they
were
lost
to
sight
of
course
they
were
all
well
out
of
range
and
as
we
were
quite
ready
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
wait
till
they
came
out
in
the
open
within
range
and
then
to
shoot
them
down
the
minutes
seemed
to
crawl
five
then
ten
minutes
passed
with
no
further
sign
of
the
enemy
suddenly
beg
pardon
sir
i
think
i
see
somethink
on
top
of
that
on
the
fur
side
yonder
one
of
the
men
drew
my
attention
to
a
few
specks
which
looked
like
wagons
moving
about
on
the
flatish
shoulder
of
incidentamba
whilst
i
was
focussing
my
glasses
there
was
a
boom
from
the
hill
followed
by
a
sharp
report
and
a
puff
of
smoke
up
in
the
air
quite
close
by
then
the
sound
as
of
heavy
rain
pattering
down
some
two
hundred
feet
in
front
of
the
trench
each
drop
raising
its
own
little
cloud
of
dust
this
of
course
called
forth
the
remarks
of
what
ho
she
bumps
and
now
we
sha
be
long
which
proved
only
too
true
i
was
aghast
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
possibility
of
guns
being
used
against
me
though
had
i
remembered
their
existence
i
do
not
know
with
my
then
knowledge
what
difference
it
would
have
made
to
my
defensive
measures
as
there
was
some
little
uneasiness
among
my
men
i
quite
cheerful
in
the
security
of
our
nice
trench
with
the
thick
parapet
at
once
shouted
out
it
all
right
men
keep
under
cover
and
they
ca
touch
us
a
moment
later
there
was
a
second
boom
the
shell
whistled
over
our
heads
and
the
hillside
some
way
behind
the
trench
was
spattered
with
bullets
by
this
time
we
were
crouching
as
close
as
possible
to
the
parapet
which
though
it
had
seemed
only
quite
a
short
time
before
so
complete
now
suddenly
felt
most
woefully
inadequate
with
those
beastly
shells
dropping
their
bullets
down
from
the
sky
another
boom
this
time
the
shell
burst
well
and
the
whole
ground
in
front
of
the
trench
was
covered
with
bullets
one
man
being
hit
at
this
moment
rifle
fire
began
on
waschout
hill
but
no
bullets
came
our
way
almost
immediately
another
shot
followed
which
showered
bullets
all
over
us
a
few
more
men
were
hit
whose
groans
were
unpleasant
to
listen
to
tools
were
seized
and
men
began
frantically
to
try
and
dig
themselves
deeper
into
the
hard
earth
as
our
trench
seemed
to
give
no
more
protection
from
the
dropping
bullets
than
a
saucer
would
from
a
storm
of
rain
but
it
was
too
late
we
could
not
sink
into
the
earth
fast
enough
the
boers
had
got
the
range
of
the
trench
to
a
nicety
and
the
shells
burst
over
us
now
with
a
horrible
methodic
precision
several
men
were
hit
and
there
was
no
reason
why
the
enemy
should
cease
to
rain
shrapnel
over
us
until
we
were
all
killed
as
we
were
absolutely
powerless
to
do
anything
i
put
up
the
white
flag
all
i
could
do
was
to
thank
providence
that
the
enemy
had
no
field
guns
or
though
we
had
not
been
long
we
should
have
been
blotted
out
before
we
could
have
hoisted
it
as
soon
as
the
ceased
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
no
party
of
boers
came
down
from
their
artillery
position
on
incidentamba
to
take
our
surrender
but
within
three
minutes
some
fifty
boers
galloped
up
from
the
river
bank
on
the
east
and
the
west
and
a
few
more
came
up
from
the
south
round
waschout
hill
the
guard
on
waschout
hill
which
had
done
a
certain
amount
of
damage
to
the
enemy
had
two
men
wounded
by
rifle
fire
not
a
single
shell
had
come
near
them
though
they
were
close
to
the
kaffir
huts
which
were
plain
enough
what
an
the
reality
had
been
from
the
pleasurable
anticipations
of
the
early
morn
when
i
had
first
sighted
the
boers
of
course
the
women
on
the
farm
had
betrayed
us
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
why
the
boers
had
at
first
halted
and
begun
to
be
suspicious
before
they
had
seen
the
women
at
the
farm
what
could
they
have
discovered
i
failed
entirely
to
solve
this
mystery
during
the
day
trek
the
following
lessons
slowly
evolved
themselves
and
were
stored
in
my
mind
in
addition
to
those
already
learnt
when
collecting
the
friendly
stranger
and
his
sons
in
order
to
prevent
their
taking
information
to
the
enemy
of
your
existence
and
whereabouts
if
you
are
wishful
for
a
surprise
packet
do
not
forget
also
to
gather
his
wife
and
his
daughter
his
manservant
and
his
maidservant
who
also
have
tongues
and
his
ox
and
his
ass
which
may
possibly
serve
the
enemy
of
course
if
they
are
very
numerous
or
very
far
off
this
is
impossible
only
do
not
then
hope
to
surprise
the
enemy
do
not
forget
that
if
guns
are
going
to
be
used
against
you
a
shallow
trench
with
a
low
parapet
some
way
from
it
is
worse
than
useless
even
though
the
parapet
be
ten
times
over
the
trench
gives
the
gunners
an
object
to
lay
on
and
gives
no
protection
from
shrapnel
against
artillery
fire
it
would
be
better
to
scatter
the
defenders
in
the
open
hidden
in
grass
and
bushes
or
behind
stones
or
than
to
keep
them
huddled
in
such
a
trench
with
your
men
scattered
around
you
can
safely
let
the
enemy
fill
your
trench
to
the
brim
with
shrapnel
bullets
though
to
stop
a
shrapnel
bullet
much
less
actual
thickness
of
earth
is
necessary
than
to
stop
a
rifle
bullet
yet
this
earth
must
be
in
the
right
place
for
protection
you
must
be
able
to
get
right
close
under
the
cover
as
narrow
a
trench
as
possible
with
the
sides
and
inside
of
the
parapet
as
steep
as
they
will
stand
will
give
you
the
best
chance
to
hollow
out
the
bottom
of
the
trench
sides
to
give
extra
room
will
be
even
better
because
the
open
top
of
the
trench
can
be
kept
the
less
wide
the
more
like
a
mere
slit
the
open
top
of
the
trench
is
the
fewer
shrapnel
bullets
will
get
in
while
chewing
over
these
lessons
learnt
from
bitter
experience
i
had
yet
another
dream
fourth
dream
o
wad
some
power
the
giftie
gie
us
to
see
oursels
as
others
see
us
burns
again
did
i
find
myself
facing
the
same
problem
this
time
with
lessons
to
guide
me
i
started
off
by
sending
out
patrols
as
described
in
my
last
dream
but
their
orders
were
slightly
different
all
human
beings
were
to
be
brought
into
our
post
and
any
animals
which
could
be
of
use
to
the
enemy
were
to
be
shot
as
we
had
no
place
for
them
for
my
defensive
post
i
chose
the
position
already
described
in
my
last
dream
which
seemed
very
suitable
for
the
reasons
already
given
we
consequently
dug
a
trench
similar
in
plan
to
that
already
described
but
as
i
feared
the
possibility
of
guns
being
used
against
us
it
was
of
a
very
different
section
in
plan
it
faced
north
generally
and
was
slightly
broken
forward
to
the
front
each
half
being
quite
straight
in
section
it
was
about
three
feet
six
inches
deep
with
a
parapet
about
twelve
inches
high
in
front
of
it
we
made
the
trench
as
narrow
as
possible
at
the
top
compatible
with
free
movement
each
man
hollowed
out
the
under
part
of
the
trench
to
suit
himself
and
made
his
own
portion
of
the
parapet
to
suit
his
height
the
parapet
was
about
two
feet
six
inches
thick
at
the
top
and
quite
steep
inside
being
built
up
of
pieces
of
broken
which
were
nearly
as
hard
as
stone
the
patrols
returned
shortly
with
their
bag
of
a
few
men
women
and
children
the
women
indulged
in
much
useless
abuse
and
refused
to
obey
orders
taking
the
matter
less
philosophically
than
their
mankind
here
was
evidently
an
opportunity
of
making
use
of
the
short
training
i
had
once
had
as
i
tried
it
i
treated
the
ladies
with
tons
of
tact
in
my
suavest
manner
and
repeated
the
only
dutch
words
of
comfort
i
knew
al
zal
recht
kom
but
to
no
purpose
they
had
not
been
brought
up
to
appreciate
tact
in
fact
they
were
not
taking
any
i
turned
regretfully
round
to
the
winked
solemnly
and
officially
and
seeing
an
answering
but
respectful
quiver
in
his
left
eyelid
said
sir
which
do
you
think
is
the
best
way
of
setting
alight
to
a
farm
well
sir
some
prefer
the
large
bedstead
and
straw
but
i
think
the
and
a
little
kerosene
in
one
corner
is
as
neat
as
anything
there
was
no
need
for
more
the
ladies
quite
understood
this
sort
of
tact
the
trouble
was
over
the
dutchmen
and
kaffirs
were
at
once
started
digging
shelters
for
themselves
and
the
women
and
children
the
latter
were
placed
together
and
were
put
into
a
small
ravine
not
far
from
the
trench
as
it
was
necessary
to
place
them
in
a
really
deep
trench
firstly
to
keep
them
safe
and
secondly
to
prevent
their
waving
or
signalling
to
the
enemy
the
existence
of
this
ravine
therefore
saved
much
digging
as
it
only
required
some
hollowing
out
at
the
bottom
and
a
little
excavation
to
suit
admirably
all
dug
with
a
will
and
by
night
the
shelters
for
the
women
and
children
and
men
prisoners
and
the
firing
trench
were
nearly
done
all
arrangements
for
the
guards
and
sentries
were
the
same
as
those
described
in
the
last
dream
and
after
seeing
everything
was
all
correct
and
the
ladies
provided
with
tents
to
crawl
under
they
had
their
own
blankets
i
went
to
sleep
with
a
feeling
of
security
at
daybreak
next
morning
as
there
were
no
signs
of
any
enemy
we
continued
to
improve
our
trench
altering
the
depth
and
alignment
where
necessary
each
man
suiting
the
size
of
the
trench
to
his
own
legs
in
the
end
the
trench
really
looked
quite
neat
with
the
fresh
red
earth
contrasting
with
the
yellow
of
the
veldt
as
one
of
my
reservists
remarked
it
only
wanted
an
edging
of
oyster
shells
or
bottles
to
be
like
his
little
broccoli
patch
at
home
upon
these
important
details
and
breakfast
a
good
two
hours
had
been
spent
when
a
force
was
reported
to
the
north
in
the
same
position
as
described
in
the
previous
dream
it
advanced
in
the
same
manner
except
of
course
the
advance
men
were
met
by
no
one
at
the
farm
when
i
saw
this
i
could
not
help
patting
myself
on
the
back
and
smiling
at
the
dutch
ladies
in
the
pit
who
only
scowled
at
me
in
return
and
whisper
spat
the
advanced
party
of
the
enemy
came
on
scouting
carefully
and
stalking
the
farm
as
they
came
as
they
appeared
quite
unwarned
i
was
wondering
if
i
should
be
able
to
surprise
them
all
innocent
of
our
presence
with
a
volley
and
then
magazine
fire
into
their
midst
when
suddenly
one
man
stopped
and
the
others
gathered
round
him
this
was
when
they
were
some
yards
away
about
on
a
level
with
the
end
of
incidentamba
they
had
evidently
seen
something
and
sniffed
danger
for
there
was
a
short
palaver
and
much
pointing
a
messenger
then
galloped
back
to
the
main
body
which
turned
off
behind
incidentamba
with
its
wagons
etc
a
small
number
including
a
man
on
a
white
horse
rode
off
in
a
vague
way
to
the
west
the
object
of
this
move
i
could
not
quite
see
they
appeared
to
have
a
vehicle
with
them
of
some
sort
the
advanced
party
split
up
as
already
described
as
all
were
still
at
long
range
we
could
only
wait
very
shortly
boom
went
a
gun
from
the
top
of
incidentamba
and
a
shrapnel
shell
burst
not
far
from
us
a
second
and
third
followed
after
which
they
soon
picked
up
our
range
exactly
and
the
shell
began
to
burst
all
about
us
however
we
were
quite
snug
and
happy
in
our
nice
deep
trench
where
we
contentedly
crouched
the
waste
of
good
and
valuable
shrapnel
shell
by
the
enemy
was
the
cause
of
much
amusement
to
the
men
who
were
in
great
spirits
and
as
one
of
them
remarked
were
as
cosy
as
cockroaches
in
a
crack
at
the
expenditure
of
many
shells
two
men
only
were
hit
in
the
legs
after
a
time
the
guns
ceased
fire
and
we
at
once
manned
the
parapet
and
stood
up
to
repel
an
attack
but
we
could
see
no
boers
though
the
air
began
at
once
to
whistle
and
hum
with
bullets
nearly
all
these
seemed
to
come
from
the
in
front
to
the
north
and
and
kept
the
parapet
one
continual
spirt
of
dust
as
they
smacked
into
it
all
we
could
do
was
to
fire
by
sound
at
various
likely
bushes
on
the
and
this
we
did
with
the
greatest
possible
diligence
but
no
visible
result
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
had
had
five
men
shot
through
the
head
the
most
exposed
part
the
mere
raising
of
a
head
to
fire
seemed
to
be
absolutely
fatal
as
it
had
on
a
former
occasion
when
we
were
attempting
to
fire
at
close
range
over
a
parapet
against
the
enemy
concealed
i
saw
two
poor
fellows
trying
to
build
up
a
pitiful
little
kind
of
house
of
cards
with
stones
and
pieces
of
anthill
through
which
to
fire
this
was
as
conspicuous
as
a
on
top
of
the
parapet
and
was
at
once
shot
to
powder
before
they
had
even
used
it
but
not
before
it
had
suggested
to
me
the
remedy
for
this
state
of
affairs
of
course
we
wanted
in
such
a
case
head
cover
and
loopholes
as
usual
i
was
wise
after
the
event
for
we
had
no
chance
of
making
them
then
even
had
we
not
been
otherwise
harassed
suddenly
the
noise
of
firing
became
much
more
intense
but
with
the
smack
of
the
bullets
striking
the
earth
all
round
quite
close
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
from
which
direction
this
fresh
firing
came
at
the
same
time
the
men
seemed
to
be
dropping
much
oftener
and
i
was
impressing
them
with
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
a
brisker
fire
to
the
front
when
i
noticed
a
bullet
hit
side
of
the
parapet
it
then
became
clear
the
enemy
must
evidently
have
got
into
the
donga
behind
us
to
which
i
paid
no
attention
as
it
was
to
the
rear
and
were
shooting
us
in
the
back
as
we
stood
up
to
our
parapet
this
i
thought
must
be
what
is
called
being
taken
in
and
it
was
by
the
time
i
had
gathered
what
was
happening
about
a
dozen
more
men
had
been
bowled
over
i
then
ordered
the
whole
lot
to
take
cover
in
the
trench
and
only
pop
up
to
take
a
shot
to
the
front
or
rear
but
no
more
could
be
done
by
us
towards
the
rear
than
to
the
front
the
conditions
were
the
same
no
boers
to
be
seen
at
this
moment
two
of
the
guard
from
waschout
hill
started
to
run
in
to
our
trench
and
a
terrific
fusillade
was
opened
on
to
them
the
bullets
kicking
up
the
dust
all
round
them
as
they
ran
one
poor
fellow
was
dropped
but
the
other
managed
to
reach
our
trench
and
fall
into
it
he
too
was
badly
hit
but
just
had
the
strength
to
gasp
out
that
except
himself
and
the
man
who
had
started
with
him
all
the
guard
on
waschout
hill
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
that
the
boers
were
gradually
working
their
way
up
to
the
top
this
was
indeed
cheering
so
hot
was
the
fire
now
that
no
one
could
raise
his
head
above
ground
without
being
shot
and
by
crouching
down
altogether
and
not
attempting
to
aim
but
merely
firing
our
rifles
over
the
edge
of
the
trench
we
remained
for
a
short
time
without
casualties
this
respite
however
was
short
for
the
men
in
the
right
half
of
the
trench
began
to
drop
unaccountably
whilst
they
were
sitting
well
under
cover
and
not
exposing
themselves
at
all
i
gradually
discovered
the
cause
of
this
some
snipers
must
have
reached
the
top
of
waschout
hill
and
were
shooting
straight
down
our
right
half
trench
as
the
bullets
snicked
in
thicker
and
thicker
it
was
plain
the
number
of
snipers
was
being
increased
this
i
thought
must
be
being
from
a
flank
it
was
so
without
any
order
we
had
all
instinctively
vacated
the
right
half
of
our
trench
and
crowded
into
the
left
half
which
by
great
good
luck
could
not
be
enfiladed
from
any
point
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
nor
indeed
by
from
anywhere
as
owing
to
the
ground
its
prolongation
on
the
right
was
up
above
ground
into
the
open
air
and
to
the
left
did
not
touch
ground
for
some
yards
away
on
the
veldt
on
the
north
bank
though
we
were
huddled
together
quite
helpless
like
rats
in
a
trap
still
it
was
in
a
small
degree
comforting
to
think
that
short
of
charging
the
enemy
could
do
nothing
for
that
we
fixed
bayonets
and
grimly
waited
if
they
did
make
an
assault
we
had
bayonets
and
they
had
not
and
we
could
sell
our
lives
very
dearly
in
a
alas
i
was
again
deceived
there
was
to
be
no
chance
of
close
quarters
and
cold
steel
for
suddenly
we
heard
far
away
out
on
the
veldt
to
the
north
a
sound
as
of
some
one
beating
a
tin
tray
and
a
covey
of
little
shells
whistled
into
the
ground
close
by
the
trench
two
of
these
burst
on
touching
the
ground
right
out
of
away
on
the
open
veldt
on
the
north
i
saw
a
party
of
boers
with
a
white
horse
and
a
vehicle
then
i
knew
but
how
had
they
managed
to
hit
off
so
well
the
right
spot
to
go
to
to
enfilade
our
trench
before
they
even
knew
where
we
were
pompom
pompompom
again
and
the
little
steel
devils
ploughed
their
way
into
the
middle
of
us
in
our
mangling
seven
men
i
at
once
diagnosed
the
position
with
great
professional
acumen
we
were
now
from
flanks
but
the
knowledge
was
acquired
too
late
to
help
us
for
we
lay
bare
as
the
paunch
of
the
purser
sow
to
the
hail
of
the
nordenfeldt
this
was
the
last
straw
there
was
nothing
left
but
surrender
or
entire
annihilation
at
long
range
i
surrendered
boers
as
usual
sprang
up
from
all
round
we
had
fought
for
three
hours
and
had
killed
and
seventeen
wounded
of
these
seven
only
had
been
hit
by
the
shrapnel
and
from
the
all
the
rest
had
been
killed
or
hit
from
the
where
there
should
be
few
enemies
or
the
where
there
should
be
none
this
fact
convinced
me
that
my
preconceived
notions
as
to
the
and
its
danger
relative
to
the
other
points
of
the
compass
needed
considerable
modification
all
my
cherished
ideas
were
being
ruthlessly
swept
away
and
i
was
plunged
into
a
sea
of
doubt
groping
for
certain
or
fixed
to
lay
hold
of
could
longfellow
when
he
wrote
that
immortal
line
things
are
not
what
they
seem
ever
have
been
in
my
position
the
survivors
were
naturally
a
little
disheartened
at
their
total
discomfiture
when
all
had
started
so
well
with
them
in
their
crack
this
expressed
itself
in
different
ways
as
one
man
said
to
a
corporal
who
was
plugging
a
hole
in
his
ear
with
a
bit
of
rag
somethink
sickening
i
call
it
this
enfilading
racket
you
never
know
which
way
it
will
take
yer
i
fairly
fed
up
to
which
the
gloomy
reply
enfiladed
of
course
we
been
enfiladed
this
trench
should
have
been
wiggled
about
a
bit
and
then
there
would
not
have
been
quite
so
much
of
it
yes
wiggled
about
that
what
it
should
have
been
to
which
chipped
in
a
third
yes
and
somethink
to
keep
the
blighters
from
shooting
us
in
the
back
would
done
us
much
anyway
there
were
evidently
more
things
in
than
i
had
hitherto
dreamt
of
in
my
philosophy
as
we
trekked
away
to
the
north
under
a
detached
guard
of
boers
many
little
points
such
as
the
above
sank
into
my
soul
but
i
could
not
for
some
time
solve
the
mystery
of
why
we
had
not
succeeded
in
surprising
the
enemy
there
were
no
men
women
children
or
kaffirs
who
knew
of
our
arrival
who
could
have
warned
them
how
did
they
spot
our
presence
so
soon
as
they
evidently
must
have
done
when
they
stopped
and
consulted
in
the
morning
it
was
not
until
passing
incidentamba
as
i
casually
happened
to
look
round
and
survey
the
scene
of
the
fight
from
the
enemy
point
of
view
that
i
discovered
the
simple
answer
to
the
riddle
there
on
the
smooth
yellow
slope
of
the
veldt
just
south
of
the
drift
was
a
streak
as
plain
as
the
long
man
of
wilmington
on
the
dear
old
sussex
downs
which
positively
shrieked
aloud
hi
hi
hi
this
way
for
the
british
defence
i
then
grimly
smiled
to
think
of
myself
sitting
like
a
slick
alick
in
that
poster
of
a
trench
and
expecting
to
surprise
anybody
besides
having
been
enfiladed
and
also
taken
in
reverse
we
had
again
found
ourselves
at
a
disadvantage
as
compared
with
the
concealed
enemy
shooting
at
close
range
from
having
to
show
up
at
a
fixed
place
in
order
to
fire
eventually
i
collected
the
following
lessons
for
a
small
isolated
post
and
an
active
enemy
there
are
no
no
or
to
put
it
otherwise
it
is
all
beware
of
being
taken
in
take
care
when
placing
and
making
your
defences
that
when
you
are
engaged
in
shooting
the
enemy
to
the
front
of
your
trench
his
pal
can
not
sneak
up
and
shoot
you
in
the
back
beware
of
being
it
is
nasty
from
one
flank
far
worse
from
both
flanks
remember
also
that
though
you
may
arrange
matters
so
that
you
can
not
be
enfiladed
by
yet
you
may
be
open
to
it
from
long
range
by
means
of
gun
or
pompom
fire
there
are
few
straight
trenches
that
can
not
be
enfiladed
from
somewhere
if
the
enemy
can
only
get
there
you
can
sometimes
prevent
being
enfiladed
by
so
placing
your
trench
that
no
one
can
get
into
prolongation
of
it
to
fire
down
it
or
you
can
wiggle
it
about
in
many
ways
so
that
it
is
not
straight
or
make
traverses
across
it
or
dig
separate
trenches
for
every
two
or
three
men
do
not
have
your
trench
near
rising
ground
over
which
you
can
not
see
and
which
you
can
not
hold
do
not
huddle
all
your
men
together
in
a
small
trench
like
sheep
in
a
pen
give
them
air
as
once
before
cover
from
sight
is
often
worth
more
than
cover
from
bullets
for
close
shooting
from
a
trench
with
is
an
advantage
this
should
be
and
not
be
conspicuously
on
the
top
of
the
parapet
so
as
to
draw
fire
or
it
will
be
far
more
dangerous
than
having
none
to
surprise
the
enemy
is
a
great
advantage
if
you
wish
to
obtain
this
advantage
your
position
though
for
promotion
it
may
be
sound
to
advertise
your
position
for
defence
it
is
not
to
test
the
concealment
or
otherwise
of
your
position
look
at
it
from
the
enemy
point
of
view
fifth
dream
a
trifling
sum
of
misery
new
added
to
the
foot
of
thy
account
dryden
jack
frost
looked
forth
one
still
clear
night
and
he
said
i
shall
be
out
of
sight
so
over
the
valley
and
over
the
height
in
silence
i
take
my
way
gould
again
i
faced
the
same
task
with
a
fresh
mind
and
fresh
hopes
all
that
remained
with
me
of
my
former
attempts
being
lessons
having
detailed
the
two
patrols
and
the
guard
on
waschout
hill
as
already
described
i
spent
some
twenty
minutes
whilst
the
stores
were
being
arranged
in
walking
about
to
choose
a
position
to
hold
in
the
light
of
my
nineteen
lessons
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
any
good
being
near
the
top
of
a
hill
and
yet
not
the
top
i
would
make
my
post
on
the
top
of
waschout
hill
where
i
could
not
be
overlooked
from
any
place
within
and
where
i
should
i
believed
have
command
i
was
not
quite
certain
what
command
meant
but
i
knew
it
was
important
it
says
so
in
the
book
besides
in
all
the
manoeuvres
i
had
attended
and
tactical
schemes
i
had
seen
the
defence
always
held
a
position
on
top
of
a
hill
or
ridge
my
duty
was
plain
waschout
hill
seemed
the
only
place
which
did
not
contravene
any
of
the
nineteen
lessons
i
had
learnt
and
up
it
i
walked
as
i
stood
near
one
of
the
huts
i
got
an
excellent
view
of
the
drift
and
its
southern
approach
just
over
the
bulge
of
the
hill
and
a
clear
view
of
the
river
further
east
and
west
i
thought
at
first
i
would
demolish
the
few
grass
and
matting
huts
which
with
some
empty
kerosene
tins
and
heaps
of
bones
and
formed
the
kaffir
kraal
but
on
consideration
i
decided
to
play
cunning
and
that
this
same
kaffir
kraal
would
materially
assist
me
to
hide
my
defences
i
made
out
my
plan
of
operations
in
detail
and
we
had
soon
conveyed
all
our
stores
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
started
work
upon
the
return
of
the
patrols
with
their
prisoners
the
dutchmen
and
boys
were
told
off
to
dig
for
themselves
and
their
females
the
kaffirs
of
the
kraal
we
had
impressed
to
assist
at
once
my
arrangements
were
as
follows
all
round
the
huts
on
the
and
close
to
them
we
dug
some
ten
short
lengths
of
deep
curved
in
plan
and
each
long
enough
to
hold
five
men
these
trenches
had
extremely
low
parapets
really
only
serving
as
some
of
the
excavated
earth
being
heaped
up
the
trenches
to
the
height
of
a
foot
or
so
the
remainder
being
dealt
with
as
described
later
in
most
cases
the
parapets
were
provided
with
grooves
to
fire
through
at
the
parapet
on
each
side
being
high
enough
to
just
protect
the
head
as
with
the
background
the
men
heads
were
not
really
visible
it
was
unnecessary
to
provide
proper
loopholes
which
would
have
necessitated
also
the
use
of
new
sandbags
which
would
be
rather
conspicuous
and
troublesome
to
conceal
when
the
men
using
these
trenches
were
firing
their
heads
would
be
just
above
the
level
of
the
ground
these
having
been
got
well
under
way
the
communication
trenches
were
started
these
were
to
be
narrow
and
deep
leading
from
one
trench
to
the
next
and
also
leading
from
each
trench
back
to
four
of
the
huts
which
were
to
be
arranged
as
follows
to
allow
of
men
to
fire
standing
up
without
being
seen
round
the
inside
of
the
walls
of
these
huts
part
of
the
excavated
earth
of
which
there
was
ample
would
be
built
up
with
sand
bags
piece
of
anthill
stones
to
a
height
that
a
man
can
fire
over
about
four
and
a
half
feet
and
to
a
thickness
of
some
two
and
a
half
feet
at
the
top
and
loopholes
which
would
be
quite
invisible
cut
through
the
hut
sides
above
this
parapet
there
was
room
in
each
hut
for
three
men
to
fire
in
three
of
them
i
meant
to
place
my
best
shots
to
act
as
snipers
as
they
would
have
a
more
favorable
position
than
the
men
in
the
trenches
below
and
the
fourth
was
a
conning
tower
for
myself
all
the
tents
and
stores
were
stacked
inside
one
of
the
huts
out
of
sight
that
evening
in
spite
of
the
hardness
of
the
work
which
caused
much
grousing
among
my
men
we
had
got
the
firing
trenches
complete
but
the
others
were
not
finished
they
were
only
half
the
necessary
depth
the
inside
the
huts
were
also
not
quite
completed
the
kaffirs
and
dutch
had
deep
pits
as
before
in
three
of
the
huts
ammunition
and
rations
were
distributed
round
the
trenches
the
last
thing
before
we
turned
in
i
also
had
all
and
every
vessel
that
would
hold
water
such
as
empty
tins
kaffir
gourds
and
filled
and
distributed
in
case
of
a
long
and
protracted
fight
having
issued
orders
as
to
the
necessity
for
the
greatest
secrecy
in
not
giving
away
our
position
should
boers
turn
up
early
next
morning
i
went
to
sleep
with
confidence
we
had
anyhow
a
very
good
position
and
though
our
communications
were
not
quite
perfect
these
we
could
soon
improve
if
we
had
any
time
to
ourselves
the
next
morning
next
morning
broke
no
enemy
in
sight
this
was
excellent
and
before
daylight
we
were
hard
at
it
finishing
the
work
still
undone
by
this
time
the
men
had
fully
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
were
quite
keen
on
surprising
brother
boer
if
possible
while
the
digging
was
proceeding
the
dixies
were
being
boiled
for
the
breakfasts
inside
four
some
of
which
we
found
lying
about
so
as
to
show
nothing
but
some
very
natural
smoke
above
the
kraal
i
picked
out
one
or
two
of
my
smartest
and
instructed
them
to
walk
down
the
hill
in
different
directions
to
the
and
try
if
they
could
see
the
heads
of
the
men
in
the
firing
trenches
against
the
sky
if
so
the
heaps
of
earth
tins
bones
should
be
so
as
to
give
a
background
to
every
man
head
to
review
the
place
generally
i
and
my
orderly
walked
off
some
to
the
north
of
the
river
as
we
were
going
some
distance
we
doffed
our
helmets
and
wrapped
ourselves
in
two
beautiful
orange
and
magenta
striped
blankets
borrowed
from
our
kaffir
lady
guests
in
case
any
stray
boer
should
be
lurking
around
as
he
might
be
interested
to
see
two
khakis
wandering
about
on
the
veldt
it
was
awkward
trying
to
walk
with
our
rifles
hidden
under
our
blankets
and
moreover
every
two
minutes
we
had
to
look
around
to
see
if
the
sentry
at
the
camp
had
signalled
any
enemy
in
sight
this
was
to
be
done
by
raising
a
pole
on
the
highest
hut
the
result
of
our
work
was
splendid
we
saw
a
kaffir
kraal
on
a
hill
and
to
us
it
was
nothing
more
there
were
the
heaps
of
usually
round
a
kraal
looking
most
natural
but
no
heads
were
visible
and
no
trenches
there
was
only
one
fault
and
that
was
that
a
few
thoughtless
men
began
as
we
looked
to
spread
their
brown
army
blankets
out
in
the
sun
on
top
of
the
huts
and
on
the
veldt
to
the
veriest
new
chum
these
square
blots
like
squares
of
brown
all
around
the
kraal
would
have
betokened
something
unusual
to
remedy
this
before
it
was
too
late
i
hastened
back
after
we
had
done
our
breakfasts
and
some
three
hours
after
dawn
the
sentry
in
one
of
the
huts
reported
a
force
to
the
north
we
could
do
nothing
but
wait
and
hope
everything
was
ready
and
every
man
knew
what
to
do
no
head
was
to
be
raised
nor
a
rifle
to
be
fired
until
i
whistled
from
my
then
every
man
would
pop
up
and
empty
his
magazine
into
any
of
the
enemy
in
range
if
we
were
shelled
the
men
in
the
huts
could
at
once
drop
into
the
deep
trenches
and
be
safe
standing
in
my
from
the
loopholes
of
which
i
could
see
the
drift
i
thought
over
the
possibilities
before
us
with
great
luck
perhaps
the
boer
scouts
would
pass
us
on
either
side
and
so
allow
us
to
lie
low
for
the
main
body
with
a
view
to
seeing
exactly
how
far
i
would
let
the
latter
come
before
opening
fire
and
to
marking
the
exact
spot
when
it
would
be
best
to
give
the
word
i
got
down
into
the
facing
the
drift
and
the
road
south
to
see
how
matters
appeared
from
the
level
of
the
rifles
to
my
intense
horror
i
found
that
from
these
trenches
neither
the
drift
nor
the
road
on
the
near
bank
of
the
river
until
it
got
a
long
way
south
of
waschout
hill
be
the
bulging
convexity
of
the
hill
hid
all
this
it
must
be
it
was
the
very
spot
where
i
could
best
catch
the
enemy
where
they
pass
was
not
under
my
fire
at
most
the
northern
loopholes
of
the
conning
tower
and
one
other
hut
alone
could
give
fire
on
the
drift
how
i
cursed
my
stupidity
however
it
was
no
good
i
could
not
now
start
digging
fresh
trenches
further
down
the
hill
it
would
betray
our
whole
position
at
once
i
determined
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
we
were
not
discovered
by
the
scouts
to
open
fire
on
the
main
body
when
they
were
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
bunched
up
on
the
bank
waiting
for
those
in
front
here
we
could
fire
on
them
but
it
would
be
at
a
much
longer
range
than
i
had
intended
it
was
really
a
stroke
of
luck
that
i
had
discovered
this
serious
fault
for
otherwise
we
might
have
let
the
bulk
of
the
enemy
cross
the
drift
without
discovering
the
little
fact
of
the
dead
ground
till
too
late
i
reflected
also
though
it
was
not
much
consolation
that
i
had
erred
in
good
company
for
how
often
had
i
not
seen
a
ride
along
on
horseback
and
from
that
height
fix
the
exact
position
for
trenches
in
which
the
rifles
would
be
little
above
the
ground
these
trenches
however
had
not
been
put
to
the
test
of
actual
use
my
error
was
not
going
to
escape
in
the
same
way
meanwhile
the
enemy
scouts
had
advanced
in
much
the
same
way
as
detailed
before
except
that
after
coming
past
incidentamba
farm
they
had
not
halted
suspiciously
but
came
on
in
small
groups
or
clumps
they
crossed
the
river
in
several
places
and
examined
the
bushy
banks
most
carefully
but
finding
no
khakis
there
they
evidently
suspected
none
on
the
open
veldt
beyond
them
for
they
advanced
any
way
without
care
several
of
the
clumps
joined
together
and
came
on
chatting
in
one
body
of
some
thirty
men
would
they
examine
the
kraal
or
would
they
pass
on
my
heart
beat
the
little
hill
we
were
on
would
unluckily
be
certain
to
prove
an
attraction
for
them
because
it
was
an
excellent
vantage
ground
whence
to
scan
the
horizon
to
the
south
and
to
signal
back
to
the
main
body
to
the
north
the
kraal
was
also
a
suitable
place
to
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
main
body
came
up
to
the
drift
and
it
meant
possibly
a
fire
and
therefore
a
cup
of
coffee
they
rode
up
towards
it
laughing
chatting
and
smoking
quite
unsuspecting
we
uttered
no
sound
our
dutch
and
kaffir
guests
uttered
no
sound
either
for
in
their
pits
was
a
man
with
a
rifle
alongside
them
at
last
they
halted
a
moment
some
yards
away
on
the
northeast
where
the
slope
of
the
hill
was
more
gradual
and
showed
them
all
up
a
few
dismounted
the
rest
started
again
straight
towards
us
it
was
not
magnificent
but
it
was
war
i
whistled
about
ten
of
them
succeeded
in
galloping
off
also
some
loose
horses
five
or
six
of
them
on
the
ground
threw
up
their
hands
and
came
into
the
post
on
the
ground
there
remained
a
mass
of
kicking
horses
and
dead
or
groaning
men
the
other
parties
of
scouts
to
east
and
west
had
at
once
galloped
back
to
the
river
where
they
dismounted
under
cover
and
began
to
pepper
us
anyway
we
had
done
as
soon
as
our
immediate
enemy
were
disposed
of
we
opened
fire
on
the
main
body
some
yards
away
who
had
at
once
halted
and
opened
out
to
these
we
did
a
good
deal
of
damage
causing
great
confusion
which
was
comforting
to
watch
the
boer
in
command
of
the
main
body
must
have
gathered
that
the
was
clear
for
he
made
a
very
bold
move
he
drove
the
whole
of
the
wagons
straight
on
as
fast
as
possible
over
the
odd
yards
to
the
river
and
down
the
drift
into
the
where
they
were
safe
from
our
fire
their
losses
must
have
been
heavy
over
this
short
distance
for
they
had
to
abandon
two
of
their
wagons
on
the
way
to
the
river
this
was
done
under
cover
of
the
fire
from
a
large
number
of
riflemen
who
had
at
once
galloped
up
to
the
dismounted
and
opened
fire
at
us
and
also
of
two
guns
and
a
pompom
which
had
immediately
been
driven
a
short
distance
back
and
then
outwards
to
the
east
and
west
it
was
really
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
and
if
he
had
only
known
that
we
could
not
fire
on
the
ground
to
the
south
of
the
drift
he
might
have
come
straight
on
with
a
rush
we
had
so
far
scored
but
now
ensued
a
period
of
stalemate
we
were
being
fired
at
from
the
on
the
north
and
from
anthills
pretty
well
all
round
and
were
also
under
the
intermittent
from
the
two
guns
they
made
most
excellent
practice
at
the
huts
which
were
soon
knocked
to
bits
but
not
till
they
had
well
served
their
turn
some
of
the
new
white
sandbags
from
inside
the
huts
were
scattered
out
in
full
view
of
the
enemy
and
it
was
instructive
to
see
what
a
splendid
target
they
made
for
and
how
often
they
were
hit
they
must
have
drawn
a
lot
of
fire
away
from
the
actual
trenches
until
the
boers
discovered
that
they
could
advance
south
from
the
drift
without
being
under
from
our
position
they
were
held
up
would
they
discover
it
as
they
had
ridden
all
round
us
by
now
well
out
of
range
they
must
know
all
about
us
and
our
isolation
after
dark
by
which
time
we
had
one
man
killed
and
two
wounded
the
firing
died
away
into
a
continuous
but
desultory
with
an
occasional
dropping
shell
from
the
guns
under
cover
of
dark
i
tried
to
guard
the
drift
and
dead
ground
to
the
south
of
it
by
men
standing
up
and
firing
at
that
level
but
towards
midnight
i
was
forced
to
withdraw
them
into
the
trenches
after
several
casualties
as
the
enemy
then
apparently
woke
up
and
kept
up
a
furious
upon
us
for
over
an
hour
during
this
time
the
guns
went
through
some
mysterious
evolutions
at
first
we
got
it
very
hot
from
the
north
where
the
guns
had
been
all
along
then
suddenly
a
gun
was
opened
on
us
away
from
the
southwest
and
we
were
shelled
for
a
short
time
from
both
sides
after
a
little
the
shelling
on
the
north
ceased
and
continued
from
the
southwest
only
for
twenty
minutes
after
this
the
guns
ceased
and
the
also
gradually
died
away
when
day
dawned
not
a
living
soul
was
to
be
seen
there
were
the
dead
men
horses
and
the
deserted
wagons
i
feared
a
trap
but
gradually
came
to
the
conclusion
the
boers
had
retired
after
a
little
we
discovered
the
was
deserted
as
well
but
the
boers
had
not
retired
they
had
discovered
the
dead
ground
and
under
the
mutually
supporting
fire
of
their
guns
which
had
kept
us
to
our
trenches
had
all
the
and
trekked
south
true
we
were
not
captured
and
had
very
few
losses
and
had
severely
mauled
the
enemy
they
had
crossed
the
drift
it
must
have
evidently
been
of
great
importance
to
them
to
go
on
or
they
would
have
attempted
to
capture
us
as
they
were
about
to
our
i
had
failed
in
my
duty
during
the
next
few
hours
we
buried
the
dead
tended
the
wounded
and
took
some
rest
and
i
had
ample
leisure
to
consider
my
failure
and
the
causes
the
lessons
i
derived
from
the
fight
were
beware
of
convex
hills
and
especially
take
care
to
have
some
place
where
the
enemy
come
under
your
fire
choose
the
exact
position
of
your
with
your
eye
at
the
level
of
the
men
who
will
eventually
use
them
a
hill
may
not
after
all
though
it
has
command
be
the
best
place
to
hold
necessarily
a
conspicuous
bluff
trench
may
cause
the
enemy
to
waste
much
ammunition
and
draw
fire
away
from
the
actual
defences
in
addition
to
these
lessons
another
little
matter
on
my
mind
was
what
my
colonel
would
say
at
my
failure
lying
on
my
back
looking
up
at
the
sky
i
was
trying
to
get
a
few
winks
of
sleep
myself
before
we
started
to
improve
our
defences
against
a
possible
further
attack
but
it
was
no
use
sleep
evaded
me
the
clear
blue
vault
of
heaven
was
suddenly
overcast
by
clouds
which
gradually
assumed
the
frowning
face
of
my
colonel
you
mean
to
say
forethought
the
boers
have
but
luckily
for
me
before
more
could
be
said
the
face
began
slowly
to
fade
away
like
that
of
the
cheshire
puss
in
alice
in
wonderland
leaving
nothing
but
the
awful
frown
across
the
sky
this
too
finally
dissolved
and
the
whole
scene
changed
i
had
another
dream
sixth
dream
sweet
are
the
uses
of
adversity
once
more
was
i
fated
to
essay
the
task
of
defending
duffer
drift
this
time
i
had
lessons
below
my
belt
to
help
me
out
and
in
the
oblivion
of
my
dream
i
was
saved
that
sense
of
monotony
which
by
now
may
possibly
have
overtaken
you
gentle
reader
after
sending
out
the
patrols
and
placing
a
guard
on
waschout
hill
as
already
described
and
whilst
the
stores
were
being
collected
i
considered
deeply
what
position
i
should
take
up
and
walked
up
to
the
top
of
waschout
hill
to
spy
out
the
land
on
the
top
i
found
a
kaffir
kraal
which
i
saw
would
assist
me
much
to
concealment
should
i
decide
to
hold
this
hill
this
i
was
very
inclined
to
do
but
after
a
few
minutes
trial
of
the
shape
of
the
ground
with
the
help
of
some
men
walking
about
down
below
and
my
eyes
a
little
above
i
found
that
its
convexity
was
such
that
to
see
and
fire
on
the
drift
and
the
approach
on
the
south
side
i
should
have
to
abandon
the
top
of
the
hill
and
so
the
friendly
concealment
of
the
kaffir
huts
and
take
up
a
position
on
the
open
hillside
some
way
down
this
was
of
course
quite
feasible
especially
if
i
held
a
position
at
the
top
of
the
hill
as
well
near
the
huts
on
the
east
and
southeast
sides
but
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
really
conceal
ourselves
on
the
bare
hillside
it
meant
giving
up
all
idea
of
surprising
the
enemy
which
i
wished
to
do
i
must
therefore
find
some
other
place
which
would
lend
itself
to
easy
and
good
concealment
and
also
have
the
drift
or
its
approaches
under
close
but
where
to
find
such
a
place
as
i
stood
deep
in
thought
considering
this
knotty
problem
an
idea
gently
wormed
itself
into
my
mind
which
i
at
once
threw
out
again
as
being
absurd
and
out
of
the
question
this
idea
was
to
hold
the
river
bed
and
banks
on
each
side
of
the
drift
to
give
up
all
idea
of
command
and
instead
of
seeking
the
nearest
high
ground
which
comes
as
natural
to
the
student
of
tactics
as
rushing
for
a
tree
does
to
a
squirrel
to
take
the
lowest
ground
even
though
it
should
be
all
among
thick
cover
instead
of
being
nicely
in
the
open
no
it
was
absolutely
revolutionary
and
against
every
canon
i
had
ever
read
or
heard
of
it
was
evidently
the
freak
of
a
sorely
tried
and
worried
brain
i
would
none
of
it
and
i
put
it
firmly
from
me
but
the
more
i
argued
to
myself
the
absurdity
of
it
the
more
this
idea
obtained
possession
of
me
the
more
i
said
it
was
impossible
the
more
allurements
were
spread
before
me
in
its
favor
until
each
of
my
conscientious
objections
was
enmeshed
and
smothered
in
a
network
of
specious
reasons
as
to
the
advantages
of
the
proposal
i
resisted
i
struggled
but
finally
fell
to
temptation
dressed
up
in
the
plausible
guise
of
reason
i
would
hold
the
the
advantages
i
thus
hoped
to
obtain
were
perfect
concealment
and
cover
from
sight
trenches
and
protection
against
both
rifle
and
gun
fire
practically
ready
made
communications
under
good
cover
the
enemy
would
be
out
in
the
open
veldt
except
along
the
where
we
being
in
position
first
would
still
have
the
advantage
plentiful
at
hand
true
there
were
a
few
dead
animals
near
the
drift
and
the
tainted
air
seemed
to
hang
heavy
over
the
but
the
carcasses
could
be
quickly
buried
under
the
steep
banks
and
after
all
one
could
not
expect
luxury
as
our
clear
field
of
fire
which
in
the
north
was
only
bounded
by
the
range
of
our
rifles
was
on
the
south
limited
by
waschout
hill
a
suitable
position
for
the
enemy
to
occupy
i
decided
to
hold
the
top
of
it
as
well
as
the
all
i
could
spare
for
this
would
be
two
and
eight
men
who
would
be
able
to
defend
the
south
side
of
the
hill
the
north
being
under
our
fire
from
the
having
detailed
this
party
i
gave
my
instructions
for
the
work
which
was
soon
started
in
about
a
couple
of
hours
the
patrols
returned
with
their
prisoners
which
were
dealt
with
as
before
for
the
post
on
waschout
hill
the
scheme
was
that
the
trenches
should
be
concealed
much
in
the
same
way
as
described
in
the
last
dream
but
great
care
should
be
taken
that
no
one
in
the
post
should
be
exposed
to
from
our
main
position
in
the
river
i
did
not
wish
the
fire
of
the
main
body
to
be
in
any
degree
hampered
by
a
fear
of
hitting
the
men
on
waschout
hill
especially
at
night
if
we
knew
it
was
not
possible
to
hit
them
we
could
shoot
freely
all
over
the
hill
this
detachment
was
to
have
a
double
lot
of
besides
every
available
receptacle
collected
in
the
kraal
filled
with
water
in
anticipation
of
a
prolonged
struggle
the
general
idea
for
the
main
defensive
position
was
to
hold
both
sides
of
the
river
improving
the
existing
steep
banks
and
ravines
into
to
contain
from
one
to
four
men
these
could
with
very
little
work
be
made
to
give
cover
from
all
sides
as
such
a
large
amount
of
the
work
was
already
done
for
us
we
were
enabled
to
dig
many
more
of
these
pits
than
the
exact
number
required
for
our
party
pathways
leading
between
these
were
to
be
cut
into
the
bank
so
that
we
should
be
able
to
shift
about
from
one
position
to
another
besides
the
advantage
this
would
give
us
in
the
way
of
moving
about
according
as
we
wished
to
fire
it
also
meant
that
we
should
probably
be
able
to
mislead
the
enemy
as
to
our
numbers
which
by
such
shifting
tactics
might
for
a
time
at
least
be
much
exaggerated
the
pits
for
fire
to
the
north
and
south
were
nearly
all
so
placed
as
to
allow
the
occupants
to
fire
at
over
the
veldt
they
were
placed
well
among
the
bushes
only
just
sufficient
scrub
being
cut
away
to
allow
a
man
to
see
all
round
without
exposing
the
position
of
his
trench
on
each
side
of
the
river
just
by
the
drift
were
some
spoil
heaps
of
earth
excavated
from
the
road
ramp
these
stood
some
five
or
six
feet
above
the
general
level
and
were
as
rough
as
the
banks
in
outline
these
heaps
were
large
enough
to
allow
of
a
few
pits
being
made
on
them
which
had
the
extra
advantage
of
height
in
some
of
the
pits
to
give
loopholes
of
sandbags
were
made
though
in
most
cases
this
was
not
needed
owing
to
the
concealment
of
the
bushes
i
found
it
was
necessary
to
examine
personally
every
loophole
and
correct
the
numerous
mistakes
made
in
their
construction
some
had
the
new
clean
sandbags
exposed
to
full
view
thus
serving
as
mere
whited
sepulchres
to
their
occupants
others
were
equally
conspicuous
from
their
absurd
appearance
others
were
not
whilst
others
again
would
allow
of
shooting
in
one
direction
or
into
the
ground
at
a
few
yards
range
or
up
into
the
blue
sky
as
i
corrected
all
these
faults
i
thought
that
loopholes
not
made
under
supervision
might
prove
rather
a
snare
the
result
was
in
the
way
of
concealment
splendid
from
these
pits
with
our
heads
at
we
could
see
quite
clearly
out
on
to
the
veldt
beyond
either
from
under
the
thicker
part
of
the
bushes
or
even
through
those
which
were
close
to
our
eyes
from
the
open
on
the
other
hand
we
were
quite
invisible
even
from
yards
distance
and
would
have
been
more
so
had
we
had
the
whiskers
of
the
brethren
it
was
quite
evident
to
me
that
these
same
whiskers
were
a
wise
provision
of
nature
for
this
very
purpose
and
part
of
her
universal
scheme
of
protective
mimicry
the
numerous
small
dongas
and
rifts
lent
themselves
readily
to
flanking
fire
and
in
many
places
the
vertical
banks
required
no
cutting
in
order
to
give
ideal
protection
against
even
artillery
in
others
the
sides
of
the
crooked
waterways
had
to
be
merely
scooped
out
a
little
or
a
shelf
cut
to
stand
upon
in
one
of
these
deeper
ravines
two
tents
which
being
below
were
quite
invisible
were
pitched
for
the
women
and
children
and
small
caves
cut
for
them
in
case
of
a
bombardment
the
position
extended
for
a
length
of
some
yards
on
each
side
of
the
drift
along
both
banks
of
the
river
and
at
its
extremities
where
an
attack
was
most
to
be
feared
pits
were
dug
down
the
and
across
the
dry
these
also
were
concealed
as
well
as
possible
the
flanks
or
ends
were
of
course
our
greatest
danger
for
it
was
from
here
we
might
expect
to
be
rushed
and
not
from
the
open
veldt
i
was
undecided
for
some
time
as
to
whether
to
clear
a
field
of
fire
along
the
or
not
as
i
had
no
wish
to
give
away
our
presence
by
any
suspicious
nudity
of
the
banks
at
each
end
of
our
position
i
finally
decided
in
order
to
prevent
this
to
clear
the
scrub
for
as
great
a
range
as
possible
from
the
ends
of
the
position
everywhere
below
the
and
also
on
the
level
ground
except
for
a
good
fringe
just
on
the
edges
of
the
banks
this
fringe
i
thought
would
be
sufficient
to
hide
the
clearance
to
any
one
not
very
close
i
now
blessed
the
man
who
had
left
us
some
cutting
tools
whilst
all
this
was
being
carried
out
i
paced
out
some
ranges
to
the
north
and
south
and
these
we
marked
by
a
few
empty
tins
placed
on
etc
at
dusk
when
we
had
nearly
all
the
pits
finished
and
some
of
the
clearance
done
tents
and
gear
were
hidden
ammunition
and
rations
distributed
to
all
and
orders
in
case
of
an
attack
given
out
as
i
could
not
be
everywhere
i
had
to
rely
on
the
outlying
groups
of
men
fully
understanding
my
aims
beforehand
and
acting
on
their
own
to
prevent
our
chance
of
a
volley
into
the
enemy
being
spoilt
by
some
or
jumpy
man
opening
fire
at
long
range
i
gave
orders
that
fire
was
to
be
held
as
long
as
possible
and
that
no
man
was
to
fire
a
shot
until
firing
had
already
commenced
elsewhere
which
sounded
rather
irish
or
my
whistle
sounded
this
was
unless
the
enemy
were
so
close
to
him
that
further
silence
was
useless
firing
having
once
started
every
man
was
to
blaze
away
at
any
enemy
within
range
as
judged
by
our
range
marks
finally
we
turned
in
to
our
pits
for
the
night
with
some
complacency
each
eight
men
furnishing
their
own
sentry
we
had
about
three
hours
next
morning
before
any
enemy
were
reported
from
waschout
hill
the
signal
for
this
was
the
raising
of
a
pole
from
one
of
the
huts
this
time
was
employed
in
perfecting
our
defences
in
various
ways
we
managed
to
clear
away
the
scrub
in
the
dry
and
banks
for
some
yards
beyond
our
line
of
pits
on
each
side
and
actually
attained
to
the
refinement
of
an
obstacle
for
at
the
extremity
of
this
clearance
a
sort
of
entanglement
was
made
with
the
wire
from
an
adjacent
fence
which
the
men
had
discovered
during
the
morning
i
visited
the
post
on
waschout
hill
found
everything
correct
and
took
the
opportunity
of
showing
the
detachment
the
exact
limits
of
our
position
in
the
and
explained
what
we
were
going
to
do
after
about
three
hours
work
somebody
in
sight
was
signalled
and
we
soon
after
saw
from
our
position
a
cloud
of
dust
away
to
the
north
this
force
which
proved
to
be
a
commando
approached
as
already
described
in
the
last
dream
all
we
could
do
meanwhile
was
to
sit
tight
in
concealment
their
scouts
came
on
in
clumps
of
twos
and
threes
which
extended
over
some
mile
of
front
the
centre
of
the
line
heading
for
the
drift
as
the
scouts
got
closer
the
natural
impulse
to
make
for
the
easiest
crossing
place
was
obeyed
by
two
or
three
of
the
parties
on
each
side
of
the
one
approaching
the
drift
and
they
inclined
inwards
and
joined
forces
with
it
this
was
evidently
the
largest
party
we
could
hope
to
surprise
and
we
accordingly
lay
for
it
when
about
yards
away
the
brethren
stopped
rather
suspiciously
this
was
too
much
for
some
man
on
the
east
side
who
let
fly
and
the
air
was
rent
by
the
rattle
as
we
emptied
our
magazines
killing
five
of
this
special
scouting
party
and
two
from
other
groups
further
out
on
either
side
we
continued
to
fire
at
the
scouts
as
they
galloped
back
dropping
two
more
and
also
at
the
column
which
was
about
a
mile
away
but
afforded
a
splendid
target
till
it
opened
out
in
a
very
few
moments
our
position
was
being
shelled
by
three
guns
but
with
the
only
result
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
of
having
one
man
wounded
by
though
the
firing
went
on
slowly
till
dark
to
be
accurate
i
should
say
the
river
was
being
shelled
our
position
incidentally
for
shells
were
bursting
along
the
river
for
some
half
mile
the
boers
were
evidently
quite
at
sea
as
regards
the
extent
of
our
position
and
strength
and
wasted
many
shells
we
noticed
much
galloping
of
men
away
to
the
east
and
west
out
of
range
and
guessed
that
these
were
parties
who
intended
to
strike
the
river
at
some
distance
away
and
gradually
work
along
the
bed
in
order
probably
to
get
into
close
range
during
the
night
we
exchanged
a
few
shots
during
the
night
along
the
river
bed
and
not
much
was
done
on
either
side
though
of
course
we
were
on
the
all
the
time
but
it
was
not
till
near
one
in
the
morning
that
waschout
hill
had
an
inning
as
i
had
hoped
the
fact
that
we
held
the
kraal
had
not
been
spotted
by
the
enemy
and
a
large
body
of
them
crawling
up
the
south
side
of
the
hill
in
order
to
get
a
good
fire
on
to
us
in
the
river
struck
a
snag
in
the
shape
of
a
volley
from
our
detachment
as
the
night
was
not
very
dark
in
the
panic
following
the
first
volley
our
men
were
able
as
i
learnt
afterwards
to
stand
right
up
and
shoot
at
the
surprised
burghers
bolting
down
the
hill
however
their
panic
did
not
last
long
to
judge
by
the
sound
for
after
the
first
volley
from
our
and
the
subsequent
minute
independent
firing
the
reports
of
our
rifles
were
soon
mingled
with
the
softer
reports
of
the
mausers
and
we
shortly
observed
flashes
on
our
side
of
waschout
hill
as
these
could
not
be
our
men
we
knew
the
enemy
were
endeavoring
to
surround
the
detachment
we
knew
the
ranges
fairly
well
and
though
as
we
could
not
see
our
sights
the
shooting
was
rather
guesswork
we
soon
put
a
stop
to
this
manoeuvre
by
firing
a
small
volley
from
three
or
four
rifles
at
each
flash
on
the
so
the
night
passed
without
much
incident
during
the
dark
we
had
taken
the
opportunity
cunningly
to
place
some
new
white
sandbags
which
i
had
found
among
the
stores
in
full
view
at
some
little
distance
from
our
actual
trenches
and
pits
some
men
had
even
gone
further
and
added
a
helmet
here
and
a
coat
there
peeping
over
the
top
this
ruse
had
been
postponed
until
our
position
was
discovered
so
as
not
to
betray
our
presence
but
after
the
fighting
had
begun
no
harm
was
done
by
it
next
morning
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
see
the
very
accurate
shooting
made
by
brother
at
these
sandbags
as
betokened
by
the
little
spurts
of
dust
during
this
day
the
veldt
to
the
north
and
south
was
deserted
by
the
enemy
except
at
distance
but
a
continuous
sniping
fire
was
kept
up
along
the
on
each
side
the
boer
guns
were
shifted
one
to
the
top
of
incidentamba
and
one
to
the
east
and
west
in
order
to
enfilade
the
river
bank
but
owing
to
our
good
cover
we
escaped
with
two
killed
and
three
wounded
the
enemy
did
not
shell
quite
such
a
length
of
river
this
time
i
confidently
expected
an
attack
along
the
river
bank
that
night
and
slightly
strengthened
my
flanks
even
at
the
risk
of
dangerously
denuding
the
north
bank
i
was
not
disappointed
under
cover
of
the
dark
the
enemy
came
up
to
within
perhaps
yards
on
the
open
veldt
on
the
north
and
round
the
edges
of
waschout
hill
on
the
south
and
kept
up
a
furious
fire
probably
to
distract
our
attention
whilst
the
guns
shelled
us
for
about
an
hour
as
soon
as
the
ceased
they
tried
to
rush
us
along
the
east
and
west
but
owing
to
the
and
the
holes
in
the
ground
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
very
dark
night
they
were
unsuccessful
however
it
was
touch
and
go
and
a
few
of
the
boers
did
succeed
in
getting
into
our
position
only
to
be
bayoneted
luckily
the
enemy
did
not
know
our
strength
or
rather
our
weakness
or
they
would
have
persisted
in
their
attempt
and
succeeded
as
it
was
they
must
have
lost
or
men
killed
and
wounded
next
morning
with
so
many
men
out
of
my
original
out
of
action
not
to
include
waschout
hill
whose
losses
i
did
not
know
matters
seemed
to
be
serious
and
i
was
greatly
afraid
that
another
night
would
be
the
end
of
us
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
detachment
on
waschout
hill
had
still
got
its
tail
well
up
for
they
had
hoisted
a
red
rag
at
the
masthead
true
this
was
not
the
national
flag
probably
only
a
mere
handkerchief
but
it
was
not
white
the
day
wore
on
with
intermittent
shelling
and
sniping
and
we
all
felt
that
the
enemy
must
have
by
now
guessed
our
weakness
and
were
saving
themselves
for
another
night
attack
relying
upon
our
being
tired
out
we
did
our
best
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
by
turns
during
the
day
and
i
did
all
i
could
to
keep
the
spirits
of
the
little
force
up
by
saying
that
relief
could
not
be
very
far
off
but
it
was
with
a
gloomy
desperation
at
best
that
we
saw
the
day
wear
on
and
morning
turn
into
afternoon
the
boer
guns
had
not
been
firing
for
some
two
hours
and
the
silence
was
just
beginning
to
get
irritating
and
mysterious
when
the
booming
of
guns
in
the
distance
aroused
us
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
we
were
saved
we
could
not
say
what
guns
these
were
they
might
be
british
or
boer
but
any
way
it
proved
the
neighborhood
of
another
force
all
faces
lighted
up
for
somehow
the
welcome
sound
at
once
drew
the
tired
feeling
out
of
us
in
order
to
prevent
any
chance
of
the
fresh
force
missing
our
whereabouts
i
collected
a
few
men
and
at
once
started
to
fire
some
good
old
british
volleys
into
the
scrub
ready
present
fire
which
were
not
to
be
mistaken
shortly
afterwards
we
heard
musketry
in
the
distance
and
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
to
the
northeast
we
were
relieved
our
total
losses
were
killed
and
wounded
but
we
had
held
the
drift
and
so
enabled
a
victory
to
be
won
i
need
not
here
touch
upon
the
and
results
of
the
holding
of
drift
of
the
prevention
thereby
of
boer
guns
ammunition
and
reinforcements
reaching
one
of
their
sorely
pressed
forces
at
a
critical
moment
and
the
ensuing
victory
gained
by
our
side
it
is
now
of
course
all
public
knowledge
that
this
was
the
in
the
war
though
we
the
humble
instruments
did
not
know
what
vital
results
hung
upon
our
action
that
evening
the
relieving
force
halted
at
the
drift
and
after
burying
the
dead
we
spent
some
time
examining
the
lairs
of
the
boer
snipers
the
men
collecting
bits
of
shell
and
as
mementoes
only
to
be
thrown
away
at
once
we
found
some
dead
and
partially
buried
boers
to
whom
we
gave
burial
that
night
i
did
not
trek
but
lay
down
in
my
own
breeches
and
spotted
waistcoat
as
the
smoke
from
the
prime
segar
presented
to
me
by
my
colonel
was
eddying
in
spirals
over
my
head
these
gradually
changed
into
clouds
of
rosy
glory
and
i
heard
brass
bands
in
the
distance
playing
a
familiar
air
see
the
conquering
hero
comes
it
was
they
were
playing
i
felt
a
tap
on
my
shoulder
and
heard
a
gentle
voice
say
arise
sir
backsight
forethought
but
in
a
trice
my
dream
of
bliss
was
shattered
the
gentle
voice
changed
into
the
croak
of
my
servant
time
to
pack
your
kit
on
the
wagon

up
some
time
now

old
dreamdorp
