philadelphia

kris
kringle
it
was
christmas
eve
the
snow
had
clad
the
rolling
hills
in
white
as
if
in
preparation
for
the
sacred
morrow
the
winds
boisterous
all
day
long
at
fall
of
night
ceased
to
roar
amidst
the
naked
forest
and
now
the
silent
industry
of
the
falling
flakes
made
of
pine
and
spruce
tall
white
tents
at
last
as
the
darkness
grew
a
deepening
stillness
came
on
hill
and
valley
and
all
nature
seemed
to
wait
expectant
of
the
coming
of
the
christmas
time
above
the
broad
river
a
long
gray
stone
house
lay
quiet
its
vine
and
roof
heavy
with
the
snow
and
showing
no
sign
of
light
or
life
except
in
a
feeble
red
glow
through
the
venetian
blinds
of
the
many
windows
of
one
large
room
within
a
huge
fire
of
mighty
logs
lit
up
with
distinctness
only
the
middle
space
and
fell
with
variable
illumination
on
a
silent
group
about
the
hearth
on
one
side
a
mother
sat
with
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
her
elbow
on
the
table
gazing
steadily
into
the
fire
on
the
other
side
were
two
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
he
on
a
cushion
she
in
a
low
chair
some
sadness
repressed
for
these
little
ones
the
usual
gay
christmas
humor
of
the
hopeful
hour
commonly
so
full
for
them
of
that
anticipative
joy
to
which
life
brings
shadowy
sadness
as
the
years
run
on
now
and
then
the
boy
looked
across
the
room
pleased
when
the
leaping
flames
sent
flaring
over
floor
and
wall
long
shadows
from
the
tall
brass
andirons
or
chair
and
table
sometimes
he
glanced
shyly
at
the
mother
but
getting
no
answering
smile
kept
silence
once
or
twice
the
girl
whispered
a
word
to
him
as
the
logs
fell
and
a
sheet
of
flame
from
the
hickory
and
the
birch
set
free
the
sunshine
of
many
a
summer
day
a
moment
later
the
girl
caught
the
boy
arm
oh
hear
the
ice
hugh
she
cried
for
mysterious
noises
came
up
from
the
river
and
died
away
yes
it
is
the
ice
dear
said
the
mother
i
like
to
hear
it
as
she
spoke
she
struck
a
match
and
lit
two
candles
which
stood
on
the
table
beside
her
for
a
few
minutes
as
she
stood
her
gaze
wandered
along
the
walls
over
the
portraits
of
men
and
women
once
famous
in
colonial
days
the
great
china
bowls
set
high
for
safety
on
top
of
the
tankards
and
tall
candelabra
troubled
her
with
memories
of
more
prosperous
times
whatever
emotions
these
relics
of
departed
pride
and
joy
excited
they
left
neither
on
brow
nor
on
cheek
the
unrelenting
signals
of
life
disasters
a
glance
distinctly
tender
and
distinctly
proud
made
sweet
her
face
for
a
moment
as
she
turned
to
look
upon
the
children
the
little
fellow
on
the
cushion
at
her
feet
looked
up
mamma
we
do
want
to
know
why
christmas
comes
only
once
a
year
hush
dear
i
can
not
talk
to
you
now
not
not
at
all
but
was
not
christ
always
born
he
persisted
yes
yes
she
replied
but
i
can
not
talk
to
you
now
be
quiet
a
little
while
i
have
something
to
do
and
so
saying
she
drew
to
her
side
a
basket
of
old
letters
the
children
remained
silent
or
made
little
signs
to
one
another
as
they
watched
the
fire
meanwhile
the
mother
considered
the
papers
now
with
a
gleam
of
anger
in
her
eyes
as
she
read
and
now
with
a
momentary
blur
of
vision
most
of
the
letters
she
threw
at
once
on
the
fire
they
writhed
a
moment
like
living
creatures
and
of
a
sudden
blazed
out
as
if
tormented
into
sudden
confession
of
the
passions
of
years
gone
by
then
they
fell
away
to
black
unmemoried
things
curling
crumpled
in
the
heat
the
children
saw
them
burn
with
simple
interest
in
each
new
conflagration
something
in
the
mother
ways
quieted
them
and
they
became
intuitively
conscious
of
sadness
in
the
hour
and
the
task
at
last
the
boy
grew
uneasy
at
the
long
repose
of
tongue
o
alice
see
the
red
sparks
going
about
he
said
looking
at
the
wandering
points
of
light
in
the
blackening
scrolls
of
shrivelled
paper
nurse
says
those
are
people
going
to
church
said
his
sister
authoritatively
her
mother
looked
up
smiling
ah
that
is
what
they
used
to
tell
me
when
i
was
little
they
said
the
boy
like
in
a
vewy
dark
night
now
and
then
his
r
troubled
him
a
little
and
conscious
of
his
difficulty
he
spoke
at
times
with
oddly
serious
deliberation
you
really
must
be
quiet
said
the
mother
now
do
keep
still
or
you
will
have
to
go
to
bed
and
so
saying
she
turned
anew
to
the
basket
presently
the
girl
exclaimed
why
do
you
burn
the
letters
she
had
some
of
her
mother
persistency
and
was
not
readily
controlled
this
time
the
mother
made
no
reply
a
sharp
spasm
of
pain
went
over
her
features
looking
into
the
fire
as
if
altogether
unconscious
of
the
quick
spies
at
her
side
she
said
aloud
oh
i
can
no
more
let
them
wait
what
a
fool
i
was
what
a
fool
and
abruptly
pushed
the
basket
aside
the
little
fellow
leaped
up
and
cast
his
arms
about
her
while
his
long
yellow
hair
fell
on
her
neck
and
shoulder
o
mamma
he
cried
do
read
any
more
let
burn
them
i
hate
them
to
hurt
you
she
smiled
on
him
through
tears
rare
things
for
her
every
one
must
bear
his
own
troubles
hugh
you
could
help
me
you
could
know
dear
what
to
burn
but
i
know
said
the
girl
decisively
i
know
i
had
a
letter
once
but
hugh
never
had
a
letter
i
wish
kris
kringle
would
take
them

said
the
boy
nurse
says
kris

no

but
the
great
blue
eyes
filled
as
he
spoke
the
mother

there

hugh
only
only
more
love
from

from
one
another
and
you

said
the
girl
hush
said
hugh
and
i
do
want
a
doll
i
told
you
to
be
quiet
alice
returned
the
mother
a
rising
note
of
anger
in
her
voice
in
fact
she
was
close
upon
a
burst
of
tears
but
the
emotions
are
all
near
of
kin
and
linked
in
mystery
of
relationship
pity
and
love
for
the
moment
became
unreasoning
wrath
you
are
disobedient
she
continued
o
mamma
we
are
vewy
sorry
said
the
lad
who
had
been
the
less
offending
culprit
well
well
no
matter
it
is
children
now
to
bed
and
no
more
nonsense
i
ca
have
it
i
ca
bear
it
the
children
rose
submissively
and
kissing
her
were
just
leaving
the
room
when
she
said
oh
but
we
must
not
lose
our
manners
you
forget
the
girl
pausing
near
the
doorway
dropped
a
courtesy
that
was
very
well
done
alice
ah
that
was
better
the
little
fellow
made
a
bow
quite
worthy
of
the
days
of
minuet
and
hoop
and
then
running
back
kissed
the
tall
mother
with
a
certain
passionate
tenderness
saying
softly
now
do
you
cry
when
we
are
gone
dear
dear
mamma
and
then
in
a
whisper
i
will
pway
god
not
to
let
you
cwy
and
so
fled
away
leaving
her
still
perilously
close
to
tears
very
soon
the
old
nurse
troubled
by
the
children
disappointment
was
assuring
them
with
eager
mendacity
that
kris
would
be
certain
to
make
his
usual
visit
while
the
mother
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
she
had
that
miserable
gift
an
unfailing
memory
of
anniversaries
and
now
despite
herself
the
long
years
rolled
back
upon
her
so
that
under
the
sad
power
of
their
recurrent
memories
she
seemed
a
helpless
prey
illustration
and
opened
the
case
of
a
miniature
slowly
and
with
deliberate
care
while
the
children
were
yet
too
young
to
recognize
their
loss
the
great
calamity
of
her
life
had
come
then
by
degrees
the
wreck
of
her
fortune
had
gone
to
pieces
and
now
at
last
the
home
of
her
own
people
deeply
mortgaged
was
about
to
pass
from
her
forever
much
that
was
humbling
had
fallen
to
her
in
life
but
nothing
as
sore
as
this
final
disaster
at
length
she
rose
took
a
lighted
candle
from
the
table
and
walked
slowly
around
the
great
library
room
the
sombre
bindings
of
the
books
her
childhood
knew
called
back
dim
recollections
the
great
china
bowls
the
tall
silver
tankards
the
shining
sconces
and
above
all
the
stuart
portraits
or
the
copleys
of
the
men
who
shone
in
colonial
days
and
helped
to
make
a
more
than
imperial
nation
each
and
all
disturbed
her
as
she
gazed
at
last
she
returned
to
the
fireside
sat
down
and
began
anew
her
unfinished
task
with
hasty
hands
she
tumbled
over
the
letters
and
at
length
came
upon
a
package
tied
with
a
faded
ribbon
one
of
those
thin
silk
bands
with
which
cigars
are
tied
in
bundles
she
threw
it
aside
with
a
quick
movement
of
disdain
and
opened
the
case
of
a
miniature
slowly
and
with
deliberate
care
a
letter
fell
on
to
her
lap
as
she
bent
over
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
the
day
the
time
the
need
to
dispose
of
accumulated
letters
had
brought
her
to
this
which
she
meant
to
be
a
final
settlement
of
one
of
life
grim
accounts
for
awhile
she
steadily
regarded
the
relics
of
happier
hours
then
throwing
herself
back
in
her
chair
she
cried
aloud
how
long
i
hoped
how
hopeless
was
my
hope
and
he
said
he
said
i
was
cruel
and
hard
that
i
loved
him
no
more
oh
that
was
a
lie
a
bitter
lie
but
a
sot
a
sot
and
my
children
to
grow
up
and
see
what
i
saw
and
learn
to
bear
what
i
have
borne
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
chose
between
two
duties
and
i
was
right
i
was
the
man
of
the
two
and
i
sent
him
away
forever
he
said
yes
i
was
right
but
my
god
how
cruel
is
life
i
would
never
have
gone
never
never
there
she
exclaimed
and
threw
back
the
miniature
into
the
basket
closing
it
with
violence
as
she
did
so
as
one
may
shut
an
unpleasant
book
read
and
done
with
for
a
moment
and
with
firmer
face
she
considered
the
letter
reading
scraps
of
it
aloud
as
if
testing
her
resolution
to
make
an
end
of
it
all
hard
was
i
yes
would
i
had
been
sooner
hard
my
children
would
have
been
better
off
went
because
you
bid
me
yes
i
did
will
he
ever
know
what
that
cost
me
shall
never
come
again
until
you
bid
me
come
not
in
this
world
then
she
cried
o
hugh
hugh
and
in
a
passion
of
tears
that
told
of
a
too
great
trial
still
resolute
despite
her
partial
defeat
she
tore
the
letter
and
cast
it
on
the
fire
there
she
cried
would
to
god
i
loved
him
less
and
then
with
strange
firmness
she
took
up
a
book
and
sternly
set
herself
to
comprehend
what
she
read
the
hours
went
by
and
at
last
she
rose
wearily
put
out
one
candle
raked
ashes
over
the
embers
and
taking
the
other
light
went
slowly
up
to
bed
she
paused
a
moment
at
the
nursery
door
where
she
heard
voices
what
awake
still
we
was
only
talking
about
khwis
said
the
small
boy
we
wo
any
more
will
we
alice
she
thinks
he
wo
come
but
i
think
he
will
come
because
we
are
both
so
good
all
no
no
he
will
not
come
this
christmas
my
darlings
go
to
sleep
go
to
sleep
and
with
too
full
a
heart
she
turned
away
but
the
usual
tranquil
slumber
of
childhood
was
not
theirs
the
immense
fact
that
they
were
soon
to
leave
their
home
troubled
the
imaginative
little
man
then
too
a
great
wind
began
to
sweep
over
the
hills
and
to
shake
the
pines
on
its
way
it
carried
anew
from
the
ice
of
the
river
wild
sounds
of
disturbance
and
at
last
in
the
mid
hours
of
night
an
avalanche
of
snow
slid
from
the
roof
hugh
sat
up
he
realized
well
enough
what
had
happened
but
presently
the
quick
ear
of
childhood
was
aware
of
other
and
less
familiar
sounds
was
it
kris
kringle
oh
if
he
could
only
see
him
once
he
touched
the
sister
asleep
in
her
bed
near
by
and
at
last
shook
her
gently
what
is
it
hugh
she
said
i
hear
khwis
i
know
it
is
khwis
o
hugh
i
hear
too
but
it
might
be
a
robber
no

on

be
a
wobber
it
is
khwis
i

outside

alice
there

but

oh

but
they
nevah

and
you
need

but
are
you
sure
oh
do

she
added
both
heard
the
creaking
noise
of
footsteps
in
the
dry
snow
illustration
khwis
kwingle
are
you
there
or
is
you
a
wobber
i
will
look
i
must
look
cried
hugh
slipping
from
his
bed
in
a
moment
he
had
raised
the
sash
and
was
looking
out
into
the
night
the
sounds
he
had
heard
ceased
he
could
see
no
one
he
has
gone
alice
then
he
cried
khwis
kwingle
are
you
there
or
is
you
a
wobber
as
he
spoke
a
cloaked
man
came
from
behind
a
great
pine
and
stood
amid
the
flakes
why
that
is
hugh
he
said
hugh
he
does
know
my
name
whispered
the
lad
to
the
small
counsellor
now
at
his
side
and
of
course
i
am
kris
kringle
and
i
have
a
bag
full
of
presents
but
come
softly
down
and
let
me
in
and
do
make
a
noise
or
away
i
go
and
bring
alice
the
girl
was
still
in
doubt
but
her
desire
for
the
promised
gifts
was
strong
and
in
the
very
blood
of
the
boy
was
the
spirit
of
daring
adventure
there
was
a
moment
of
whispered
indecision
resulting
in
two
bits
of
conclusive
wisdom
said
alice
if
we
go
together
hugh
and
he
takes
one
the
other
can
squeal
oh
very
loud
like
a
bear
a
bear
and
said
hugh
i
will
get
my
gweat
gwandpapa
sword
and
with
this
he
got
upon
a
chair
and
by
the
failing
light
of
the
nursery
fire
carefully
took
down
from
over
the
chimney
the
dress
rapier
which
had
figured
at
peaceful
levees
of
other
days
now
he
said
if
you
are
afwaid
i
will
go
all
alone
myself
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
said
she
but
i
will
go
too
so
she
hastily
slipped
on
a
little
white
wrapper
and
he
his
brown
velvet
knickerbocker
trousers
neither
had
ever
known
a
being
they
had
reason
to
fear
and
so
with
beating
hearts
but
brave
enough
they
stole
quietly
out
in
their
sweet
innocence
and
hand
in
hand
went
down
the
dark
staircase
still
hearing
faint
noises
as
they
felt
their
way
they
crossed
the
great
warm
library
and
entered
the
hall
where
with
much
effort
they
unlocked
the
door
and
lifted
the
bar
which
guarded
it
the
cold
air
swept
in
and
before
them
was
a
tall
man
in
a
cloak
half
white
with
snow
he
said
at
once
oh
hugh
alice
pleasant
christmas
to
you
let
us
get
in
out
of
the
cold
but
carefully
carefully
no
sound
as
he
spoke
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
come
he
said
and
seeming
to
know
the
way
went
before
them
into
the
library
oh
i
so
frightened
said
alice
to
hugh
in
a
whisper
i
wish
i
was
in
bed
not
so
the
boy
the
man
pushed
away
the
ashes
from
the
smouldering
logs
and
took
from
the
wood
basket
a
quantity
of
birch
bark
and
great
cones
of
the
pine
as
he
cast
them
on
the
quick
embers
a
fierce
red
blaze
went
up
and
the
room
was
all
alight
and
now
he
turned
quickly
for
hugh
of
a
mind
to
settle
the
matter
was
standing
on
guard
between
him
and
the
door
to
the
stairway
which
they
had
left
open
when
they
came
down
the
man
smiled
as
he
saw
the
lad
push
his
sister
back
and
come
a
step
or
two
forward
he
made
a
pretty
picture
in
his
white
shirt
brown
and
little
bare
legs
the
yellow
locks
about
his
shoulders
the
rapier
in
his
hand
alert
and

brilliant
blaze
the
man
leaned
heavily
upon
a
chair
back
his
lips
moving
a
great
stir
of
emotion
shaking
him
as
he
gazed
on

alice
on
more
sordid
things
intent
that
the
way
with
girls
kwingle
they
ca
wait
ah
well
well
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
bad
boy
and
he
was
very
naughty
and
no
one
loved
him
because
he
spent
love
like
money
till
it
was
all
gone
when
he
found
he
had
no
more
love
given
him
he
went
away
and
away
to
a
far
country
like
the
man
in
the
bible
said
hugh
promptly
the
the
his
name
alice
the
prodigal
son
said
kris
you

the
pwodigal
son
yes
like
the
prodigal
son
well
at

he
came
to
the
black
hills
and
there
he
lived
with
other
rough
men
but
you
did
say
he
was
a
boy
said
alice
accurately
critical
he
was
gwowed
up
alice
do
you
int
inter
interrupt
you
goosey
said
alice
one
christmas
eve
these
men
fell
to
talking
of
their
homes
and
made
up
their
minds
to
have
a
good
dinner
but
hugh
oh
exclaimed
the
lad
hugh
chris
nodded
and
continued
but
hugh
felt
very
weak
because
he
was
just
getting
well
of
a
fever
yet
they
persuaded
him
to
come
to
table
with
the
rest
one
man
a
german
stood
up
and
said
is
the
eve
of
christmas
i
will
say
our
grace
what
we
say
at
home
one
man
laughed
but
the
others
were
still
then
the
german
said
lord
christ
and
be
our
guest
take
with
us
what
thou
hast
blest
when
hugh
heard
the
words
the
german
said
he
began
to
think
of
home
and
of
many
christmas
eves
and
because
he
felt
a
strangeness
in
his
head
he
said
not
well
i
will
go
into
the
air
as
he
moved
he
saw
before
him
a
man
in
the
doorway
the
face
of
the
man
was
sad
and
his
garment
was
white
as
snow
he
said
me
but
no
others
except
hugh
saw
or
heard
now
when
hugh
went
outside
the
man
he
had
seen
was
gone
but
being
still
confused
hugh
went
over
the
hard
snow
and
among
trees
not
knowing
what
he
did
and
at
last
after
wandering
a
long
time
he
came
to
a
steep
hillside
here
he
slipped
and
rolling
down
fell
over
a
high
place
down
down
down
he
fell
and
he
fell
oh
make
him
stop
cried
little
hugh
he
fell
on
to
a
deep
bed
of
soft
snow
and
was
not
hurt
but
soon
got
up
and
thought
he
was
buried
in
a
white
tomb
but
soon
he
understood
and
his
head
grew
clearer
and
he
beat
the
snow
away
and
got
out
then
first
he
said
a
prayer
and
that
was
the
only
prayer
he
had
said
in
a
long
time
oh
my
cried
little
hugh
i
did
think
people
could
nevah
sleep
unless
they
say
their
prayers
that
what
nurse
says
does
she
alice
and
just
here
kris
had
to
wipe
his
eyes
but
he
took
the
little
fellow
hand
in
his
and
went
on
soon
he
found
shelter
under
a
cliff
where
no
snow
was
and
with
his
flint
and
steel
struck
a
light
and
made
with
sticks
and
logs
a
big
fire
after
this
he
felt
warm
and
better
all
over
and
fell
asleep
when
he
woke
up
it
was
early
morning
and
looking
about
he
saw
in
the
rock
little
yellow
streaks
and
small
lumps
and
then
he
knew
he
had
found
a
great
mine
of
gold
no
man
had
ever
seen
before
by
and
by
he
got
out
of
the
valley
and
found
his
companions
and
in
the
spring
he
went
to
his
mine
which
because
he
had
found
it
was
all
his
own
and
he
got
people
to
work
there
and
dig
out
the
gold
after
that
he
was
no
longer
poor
but
very
very
rich
and
was
he
good
then
said
hugh
and
did
he
go
home
said
alice
and
buy
things
yes
he
went
one
day
he
went
home
and
at
night
saw
his
house
and
little
children
and
but
he
will
not
stay
because
there
is
no
love
waiting
in
his
house
and
all
the
money
in
the
world
is
no
good
unless
there
is
some
love
too
you
see
dear
a
house
is
just
a
house
of
brick
and
mortar
but
when
it
is
full
of
love
then
it
is
a
home
i
like
that
man
said
hugh
tell
me
more
but
first
said
alice
oh

do
want
to
see
all
our
presents
ah
well
that
is
all
i
think
and
the
presents
now
for
the
presents
then
he
opened
a
bag
and
took
out
first
a
string
of
great
pearls
and
said
as
he
hung
them
around
alice
neck
there
these
the
oysters
made
for
you
years
ago
under
the
deep
blue
sea
they
are
for
a
wedding
gift
from
chris
they
are
too
fine
for
a
little
maid
no
queen
has
prettier
pearls
but
when
you
are
married
and
some
one
you
love
vexes
you
or
is
unkind
look
at
these
pearls
and
forgive
oh
a
hundred
times
over
twice
thrice
for
every
pearl
because
kris
said
it
you
wo
understand
now
but
some
day
you
will
yes
sir
said
alice
puzzled
and
playing
with
the
pearls
said
hugh

khwis
that
the
oysters

the
oysters

replied
kris
if
a
bit
of
something
rough
or
sharp
gets
inside
the
oyster
house
and
it
ca
be
got
rid
of
the
oyster
begins
to
make
a
pearl
of
it
and
covers
it
over
and
over
until
the
rough
rude
thing
is
one
of
these
beautiful
pearls
i
see
said
hugh
that
is
a
little
fairy
tale
i
made
for
myself
i
often
make
stories
for
myself
that

be
very
nice
khwis
how
nice
it
must
be
for
your
little
children
every
night
when
you

them

yes
and
here
kris
had
to
wipe
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief

alice
looking
at
the
bag
yes

kris
drew
forth
a
delicate
eastern
scarves
and
cast

around
the
girl
neck
as
she
stood
delighted
and
now
i
want

he
seemed
to
doubt
it
oh
yes
they
cried
and
cast
their
little
arms
about
him
while
he
held
them
in
a
long
embrace
loath
to
let
them
go
o
alice
said
hugh
khwis

cwying

said
once
i

little
children
and
you

alice
silently

on
the

hugh
said

kris
lit
a
candle
and
took
paper
and
pen
from
the
table
and
as
they
sat
quietly
waiting
full
of
the
marvel
of
this
famous
adventure
he
wrote
busily
now
and
then
pausing
to
smile
on
them
until
he
closed
and
gave
the
letter
to
the
boy

things
he
said

the

kissed
them
again
and
went
by
and
opened
the
door
to
the
stairway
we
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
hugh
and
standing
aside
he
waited
for
alice
to
pass
having
in
his
ways
something
of
the
grave
courtesy
of
the
ancestors
who
looked
down
on
him
from
the
walls
alice
courtesied
and
the
small
cavalier
still
with
the
old
rapier
in
hand
bowed
low
kris
stood
at
the
door
and
listened
to
the
patter
of
little
feet
upon
the
stair
then
he
closed
it
with
noiseless
care
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
put
out
the
candles
resumed
his
cloak
and
left
the
house
the
snow
no
longer
fell
the
waning
night
was
clearer
and
to
eastward
a
faint
rosy
gleam
foretold
the
coming
of
the
sun
of
christmas
kris
glanced
up
at
the
house
and
turning
went
slowly
down
the
garden
path
long
before
their
usual
hour
of
rising
the
children
burst
into
the
mother
room

from

while

great
pearls

over
and
lay
on
the
sunlit

i
say
wife
i
promised
to
come
no
more
until
you
asked
me
to
come
i
can
stand
it
no
longer
i
came
only
meaning
to
see
the
dear
home
and
to
send
you
and
my
dear
children
a
remembrance
but
i
you
know
the
rest
if
in
those
dark
days
the
mother
care
and
fear
instinctively
set
aside
what
little
love
was
left
for
me
i
do
not
now
wonder
was
it
well
or
ill
what
you
did
when
you
bid
me
go
in
god
time
i
have
learned
to
think
it
well
that
hour
is
to
me
now
like
a
blurred
dream
i
can
bless
the
anger
and
the
sense
of
duty
to
our
children
which
drove
me
forth
too
debased
a
thing
to
realize
my
loss
i
have
won
again
my
thank
god
am
a
man
once
more
you
have
have
always
had
my
love
you
have
again
a
dozen
times
the
fortune
i
meanly
squandered
i
shall
never
touch
it
it
is
yours
and
your
children
and
now
alice
is
all
love
dead
for
me
and
is
it
yes
or
no
and
shall
i
be
always
to
my
little
ones
kris
and
a
mysterious
memory
or
shall
i
be
once
more
your
hugh
a
letter
to
the
bank
will
find
me
as
she
read
the
quick
tears
came
aflood
she
turned
to
her
desk
and
wrote
in
tremulous
haste
come
come
at
once
and
ringing
for
the
maid
sent
it
off
to
the
address
he
gave
the
next
morning
she
dressed
with
unusual
care
at
the
sound
of
the
whistle
of
the
train
she
went
down
to
the
door
presently
a
strong
erect
eager
man
came
swiftly
up
the
pathway
she
was
in
his
arms
a
minute
after
little
hugh
exclaiming
o
alice
khwis
is
kissing
mamma
