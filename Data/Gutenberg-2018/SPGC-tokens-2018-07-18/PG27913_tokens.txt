chapter
one
the
father
of
waters
father
of
waters
i
worship
thy
mighty
stream
as
the
hindoo
by
the
shores
of
his
sacred
river
i
kneel
upon
thy
banks
and
pour
forth
my
soul
in
wild
adoration
far
different
are
the
springs
of
our
devotion
to
him
the
waters
of
his
yellow
ganges
are
the
symbols
of
a
superstitious
awe
commingled
with
dark
fears
for
the
mystic
future
to
me
thy
golden
wares
are
the
souvenirs
of
joy
binding
the
present
to
the
known
and
happy
past
yes
mighty
river
i
worship
thee
in
the
past
my
heart
fills
with
joy
at
the
very
mention
of
thy
name
father
of
waters
i
know
thee
well
in
the
land
of
a
thousand
lakes
on
the
summit
of
the
de
i
have
leaped
thy
tiny
stream
upon
the
bosom
of
the
blue
lakelet
the
fountain
of
thy
life
i
have
launched
my
birchen
boat
and
yielding
to
thy
current
have
floated
softly
southward
i
have
passed
the
meadows
where
the
wild
rice
ripens
on
thy
banks
where
the
white
birch
mirrors
its
silvery
stem
and
tall
fling
their
pyramid
shapes
on
thy
surface
i
have
seen
the
red
chippewa
cleave
thy
crystal
waters
in
his
bark
canoe
the
giant
moose
lave
his
flanks
in
thy
cooling
flood
and
the
stately
wapiti
bound
gracefully
along
thy
banks
i
have
listened
to
the
music
of
thy
shores
the
call
of
the
cacawee
the
laugh
of
the
goose
and
the
of
the
great
northern
swan
yes
mighty
river
even
in
that
far
northern
land
thy
wilderness
home
have
i
worshipped
thee
onward
through
many
parallels
of
latitude
through
many
degrees
of
the
thermal
line
i
stand
upon
thy
banks
where
thou
leapest
the
rocks
of
saint
antoine
and
with
bold
frothing
current
cleavest
thy
way
to
the
south
already
i
note
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
thy
shores
the
have
disappeared
and
thou
art
draped
with
a
deciduous
foliage
of
livelier
hue
oaks
elms
and
maples
mingle
their
frondage
and
stretch
their
broad
arms
over
thee
though
i
still
look
upon
woods
that
seem
illimitable
i
feel
that
the
wilderness
is
past
my
eyes
are
greeted
by
the
signs
of
civilisation
its
sounds
fall
upon
my
ear
the
hewn
cabin
picturesque
in
its
rudeness
stands
among
prostrate
trunks
and
the
ring
of
the
lumberer
axe
is
heard
in
the
far
depths
of
the
forest
the
silken
blades
of
the
maize
wave
in
triumph
over
fallen
trees
its
golden
tassels
giving
promise
of
a
rich
return
the
spire
of
the
church
peers
above
the
green
spray
of
the
woods
and
the
prayer
of
the
christian
ascends
to
heaven
sublimely
mingling
with
the
roar
of
thy
waters
i
launch
my
boat
once
more
on
thy
buoyant
wave
and
with
heart
as
buoyant
glide
onward
and
southward
i
pass
between
bold
bluffs
that
hem
thy
surging
waves
and
trace
with
pleasant
wonder
their
singular
and
varied
outlines
now
soaring
abruptly
upward
now
carried
in
gentle
undulations
along
the
blue
horizon
i
behold
the
towering
form
of
that
noted
landmark
montaigne
qui
trempe
a
and
the
swelling
cone
on
whose
summit
the
pitched
his
tent
i
glide
over
the
mirrored
bosom
of
pepin
lake
regarding
with
admiration
its
turreted
shores
i
gaze
with
deeper
interest
upon
that
precipitous
escarpment
the
lover
leap
whose
rocky
wall
has
oft
echoed
back
the
joyous
chaunt
of
the
voyageur
and
once
a
sadder
strain
the
of
wanona
beautiful
wanona
who
sacrificed
life
to
love
onward
i
glide
where
the
boundless
prairies
of
the
west
impinge
upon
thy
stream
and
my
eye
wanders
with
delight
over
their
fadeless
green
i
linger
a
moment
to
gaze
upon
the
painted
warrior
spurring
his
wild
steed
along
thy
banks
to
gaze
upon
the
dacotah
girls
bathing
their
lithe
limbs
in
thy
crystal
wave
then
on
again
past
the
cornice
rocks
the
metalliferous
shores
of
galena
and
dubuque
the
aerial
tomb
of
the
adventurous
miner
i
reach
the
point
where
the
turbid
missouri
rushes
rudely
upon
thee
as
though
he
would
force
thee
from
thy
onward
course
poised
in
my
light
canoe
i
watch
the
struggle
fierce
but
short
it
is
for
thou
triumphest
and
thy
conquered
rival
is
compelled
to
pay
his
golden
tribute
to
thy
flood
that
rolls
majestically
onward
upon
thy
victorious
wave
i
am
borne
still
southward
i
behold
huge
green
mounds
the
sole
monuments
of
an
ancient
people
who
once
trod
thy
shores
near
at
hand
i
look
upon
the
dwellings
of
a
far
different
race
i
behold
tall
spires
soaring
to
the
sky
domes
and
cupolas
glittering
in
the
sun
palaces
standing
upon
thy
banks
and
palaces
floating
upon
thy
wave
i
behold
a
great
city
a
metropolis
i
linger
not
here
i
long
for
the
sunny
south
and
trusting
myself
once
more
to
thy
current
i
glide
onward
i
pass
the
estuary
of
the
ohio
and
the
embouchure
of
another
of
thy
mightiest
tributaries
the
famed
river
of
the
plains
how
changed
the
aspect
of
thy
shores
i
no
longer
look
upon
bold
bluffs
and
beetling
cliffs
thou
hast
broken
from
the
hills
that
enchained
thee
and
now
rollest
far
and
free
cleaving
a
wide
way
through
thine
own
alluvion
thy
very
banks
are
the
creation
of
thine
own
fancy
the
slime
thou
hast
flung
from
thee
in
thy
moments
of
wanton
play
and
thou
canst
break
through
their
barriers
at
will
forests
again
fringe
thee
forests
of
giant
trees
the
spreading
the
tall
and
the
rising
in
terraced
groves
from
the
margin
of
thy
waters
forests
stand
upon
thy
banks
and
the
wreck
of
forests
is
borne
upon
thy
bubbling
bosom
i
pass
thy
last
great
affluent
whose
crimson
flood
just
tinges
the
hue
of
thy
waters
down
thy
delta
i
glide
amid
scenes
rendered
classic
by
the
sufferings
of
de
soto
by
the
adventurous
daring
of
iberville
and
la
salle
and
here
my
soul
reaches
the
acme
of
its
admiration
dead
to
beauty
must
be
heart
and
eye
that
could
behold
thee
here
in
this
thy
southern
land
without
a
thrill
of
sublimest
emotion
i
gaze
upon
lovely
landscapes
ever
changing
like
scenes
of
enchantment
or
the
pictures
of
a
panorama
they
are
the
loveliest
upon
earth
for
where
are
views
to
compare
with
thine
not
upon
the
rhine
with
its
castled
rocks
not
upon
the
shores
of
that
ancient
inland
sea
not
among
the
isles
of
the
ind
no
in
no
part
of
the
world
are
scenes
like
these
nowhere
is
soft
beauty
blended
so
harmoniously
with
wild
picturesqueness
and
yet
not
a
mountain
meets
the
eye
not
even
a
hill
but
the
dark
draped
with
the
silvery
form
a
background
to
the
picture
with
all
the
grandeur
of
the
pyrogenous
granite
the
forest
no
longer
fringes
thee
here
it
has
long
since
fallen
before
the
planter
axe
and
the
golden
the
silvery
rice
and
the
snowy
flourish
in
its
stead
forest
enough
has
been
left
to
adorn
the
picture
i
behold
vegetable
forms
of
tropic
aspect
with
broad
shining
foliage
the
palm
the
anona
the
tupelo
the
catalpa
with
its
large
trumpet
flowers
the
melting
and
the
mangolia
blending
their
foliage
with
these
fair
are
an
hundred
lovely
exotics
the
orange
lemon
and
fig
the
and
tamarind
olives
myrtles
and
bromelias
while
the
babylonian
willow
contrasts
its
drooping
fronds
with
the
erect
reeds
of
the
giant
cane
or
the
blades
of
the
embowered
amidst
these
beautiful
forms
i
behold
villas
and
mansions
of
grand
and
varied
aspect
varied
as
the
races
of
men
who
dwell
beneath
their
roofs
and
varied
are
they
for
the
nations
of
the
world
dwell
together
upon
thy
banks
each
having
sent
its
tribute
to
adorn
thee
with
the
emblems
of
a
glorious
and
universal
civilisation
father
of
waters
farewell
though
not
born
in
this
fair
southern
land
i
have
long
lingered
there
and
i
love
it
better
than
the
land
of
my
i
have
there
spent
the
hours
of
bright
youth
of
adventurous
manhood
and
the
retrospect
of
these
hours
is
fraught
with
a
thousand
memories
tinged
with
a
romance
that
can
never
die
there
my
young
heart
yielded
to
the
influence
of
love
a
first
and
virgin
love
no
wonder
the
spot
should
be
to
me
the
most
hallowed
on
earth
reader
listen
to
the
story
of
that
love
chapter
two
six
months
in
the
crescent
city
like
other
striplings
escaped
from
college
i
was
no
longer
happy
the
yearning
for
travel
was
upon
me
and
i
longed
to
make
acquaintance
with
that
world
as
yet
only
known
to
me
through
the
medium
of
books
my
longing
was
soon
to
be
gratified
and
without
a
sigh
i
beheld
the
hills
of
my
native
land
sink
behind
the
black
waves
not
much
caring
whether
i
should
ever
see
them
again
though
emerging
from
the
walls
of
a
classic
college
i
was
far
from
being
tinctured
with
classic
sympathies
ten
years
spent
in
pondering
over
the
wild
hyperbole
of
homer
the
mechanical
of
virgil
and
the
dry
indelicacies
of
horatius
flaccus
had
failed
to
imbue
me
with
a
perception
of
that
classic
beauty
felt
or
pretended
to
be
felt
by
the
spectacled
my
mind
was
not
formed
to
live
on
the
ideal
or
dream
over
the
past
i
delight
rather
in
the
real
the
positive
and
the
present
don
quixotes
may
play
the
troubadour
among
ruined
castles
and
mincing
misses
cover
the
ground
of
the
for
my
part
i
have
no
belief
in
the
romance
of
life
in
the
modern
tell
i
behold
a
hireling
ready
to
barter
his
brawny
limbs
to
the
use
of
whatever
tyrant
and
the
picturesque
mazzaroni
upon
closer
acquaintance
dwindles
down
to
the
standard
of
a
thief
amid
the
crumbling
walls
of
athens
and
the
ruins
of
rome
i
encounter
inhospitality
and
hunger
i
am
not
a
believer
in
the
picturesqueness
of
poverty
i
have
no
relish
for
the
romance
of
rags
and
yet
it
was
a
yearning
for
the
romantic
that
called
me
from
home
i
longed
for
the
poetic
and
picturesque
for
i
was
just
at
that
age
when
the
mind
is
imbued
with
its
strongest
faith
in
their
reality
ha
mine
is
not
yet
disabused
of
this
belief
i
am
older
now
but
the
hour
of
disenchantment
has
not
yet
come
upon
me
nor
ever
will
there
is
a
romance
in
life
that
is
no
illusion
it
lives
not
in
the
effete
forms
and
childish
ceremonies
of
the
fashionable
it
has
no
illustration
in
the
tinsel
trappings
and
gaudy
puerilities
of
a
court
stars
garters
and
titles
are
its
antidotes
red
cloth
and
plush
the
of
its
existence
its
home
is
elsewhere
amid
the
grand
and
sublime
scenes
of
nature
though
these
are
not
necessary
accompaniments
it
is
no
more
incidental
to
field
and
forest
rock
river
and
mountain
than
to
the
ways
of
the
its
home
is
in
human
hearts
hearts
that
throb
with
high
aspirations
bosoms
that
burn
with
the
noble
passions
of
liberty
and
love
my
steps
then
were
not
directed
towards
classic
shores
but
to
lands
of
newer
and
more
vigorous
life
westward
went
i
in
search
of
romance
i
found
it
in
its
most
attractive
form
under
the
glowing
skies
of
louisiana
in
the
month
of
january
i
set
foot
upon
the
soil
of
the
upon
a
spot
stained
with
english
blood
the
polite
skipper
who
had
carried
me
across
the
atlantic
landed
me
in
his
gig
i
was
curious
to
examine
the
field
of
this
decisive
action
for
at
that
period
of
my
life
i
had
an
inclination
for
martial
affairs
but
something
more
than
mere
curiosity
prompted
me
to
visit
the
of
new
orleans
i
then
held
an
opinion
deemed
heterodox
namely
that
the
soldier
is
under
certain
circumstances
quite
equal
to
the
professional
hireling
and
that
long
military
drill
is
not
essential
to
victory
the
story
of
war
superficially
studied
would
seem
to
antagonise
this
theory
which
conflicts
also
with
the
testimony
of
all
military
men
but
the
testimony
of
mere
military
men
on
such
a
matter
is
without
value
who
ever
heard
of
a
military
man
who
did
not
desire
to
have
his
art
considered
as
mythical
as
possible
moreover
the
rulers
of
the
world
have
spared
no
pains
to
imbue
their
people
with
false
ideas
upon
this
point
it
is
necessary
to
put
forward
some
excuse
for
that
terrible
incubus
upon
the
nations
the
standing
army
my
desire
to
view
the
upon
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
had
chiefly
reference
to
this
question
the
action
itself
had
been
one
of
my
strong
arguments
in
favour
of
my
belief
for
upon
this
spot
some
six
thousand
men
who
had
never
heard
the
absurd
command
eyes
right
whipped
in
fact
nearly
annihilated
a
and
veteran
army
of
twice
their
number
since
standing
upon
that
i
have
carried
a
sword
in
more
than
one
field
of
action
what
i
then
held
only
as
a
theory
i
have
since
proved
as
an
experience
the
drill
is
a
delusion
the
standing
army
a
cheat
in
another
hour
i
was
wandering
through
the
streets
of
the
crescent
city
no
longer
thinking
of
military
affairs
my
reflections
were
turned
into
a
far
different
channel
the
social
life
of
the
with
all
its
freshness
and
vigour
was
moving
before
my
eyes
like
a
panorama
and
despite
of
my
assumption
of
the
i
could
not
help
as
i
and
one
of
my
earliest
surprises
one
that
met
me
on
the
very
threshold
of
transatlantic
existence
was
the
discovery
of
my
own
utter
uselessness
i
could
point
to
my
desk
and
say
there
lie
the
proofs
of
my
erudition
the
highest
prizes
of
my
college
class
but
of
what
use
they
the
dry
theories
i
had
been
taught
had
no
application
to
the
purposes
of
real
life
my
logic
was
the
prattle
of
the
parrot
my
classic
lore
lay
upon
my
mind
like
lumber
and
i
was
altogether
about
as
well
prepared
to
struggle
with
life
to
benefit
either
my
or
myself
as
if
i
had
graduated
in
chinese
mnemonics
and
oh
ye
pale
professors
who
drilled
me
in
syntax
and
scansion
ye
would
deem
me
ungrateful
indeed
were
i
to
give
utterance
to
the
contempt
and
indignation
which
i
then
felt
for
ye
then
when
i
looked
back
upon
ten
years
of
wasted
existence
spent
under
your
tutelage
then
when
after
believing
myself
an
educated
man
the
illusion
vanished
and
i
awoke
to
the
knowledge
that
i
with
some
money
in
my
purse
and
very
little
knowledge
in
my
head
i
wandered
through
the
streets
of
new
orleans
wondering
as
i
went
six
months
later
and
i
was
traversing
the
same
streets
with
very
little
money
in
my
purse
but
with
my
stock
of
knowledge
vastly
augmented
during
this
six
months
i
had
acquired
an
experience
of
the
world
more
extensive
than
in
any
six
years
of
my
previous
life
i
had
paid
somewhat
dearly
for
this
experience
my
travelling
fund
had
melted
away
in
the
alembic
of
cafes
theatres
masquerades
and
quadroon
balls
some
of
it
had
been
deposited
in
that
bank
faro
which
returns
neither
principal
nor
interest
i
was
almost
afraid
to
take
stock
of
my
affairs
at
length
with
an
effort
i
did
so
and
found
after
paying
my
hotel
bills
a
balance
in
my
favour
of
exactly
dollars
dollars
to
live
upon
until
i
could
write
home
and
receive
an
answer
a
period
of
three
months
at
the
least
for
i
am
talking
of
a
time
antecedent
to
the
introduction
of
atlantic
steamers
for
six
months
i
had
been
sinning
bravely
i
was
now
all
repentance
and
desirous
of
making
amends
i
was
even
willing
to
engage
in
some
employment
but
my
cold
classic
training
that
had
not
enabled
me
to
protect
my
purse
was
not
likely
to
aid
me
in
replenishing
it
and
in
all
that
busy
city
i
could
find
no
office
that
i
was
fitted
to
fill
friendless
dispirited
a
little
disgusted
not
a
little
anxious
in
regard
to
my
immediate
future
i
sauntered
about
the
streets
my
acquaintances
were
becoming
scarcer
every
day
i
missed
them
from
their
usual
haunts
the
haunts
of
pleasure
whither
had
they
gone
there
was
no
mystery
in
their
disappearance
it
was
now
the
weather
had
become
intensely
hot
and
every
day
the
mercury
mounted
higher
upon
the
scale
it
was
already
dancing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
degrees
of
fahrenheit
in
a
week
or
two
might
be
expected
that
annual
but
unwelcome
visitor
known
by
the
soubriquet
of
yellow
jack
whose
presence
is
alike
dreaded
by
young
and
old
and
it
was
the
terror
inspired
by
him
that
was
driving
the
fashionable
world
of
new
orleans
like
birds
of
passage
to
a
northern
clime
i
am
not
more
courageous
than
the
rest
of
mankind
i
had
no
inclination
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
dreaded
demon
of
the
swamps
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
too
had
better
get
out
of
his
way
to
do
this
it
was
only
necessary
to
step
on
board
a
steamboat
and
be
carried
to
one
of
the
towns
beyond
the
reach
of
that
tropical
malaria
in
which
the
delights
to
dwell
saint
louis
was
at
this
time
the
place
of
most
attractive
name
and
i
resolved
to
go
thither
though
how
i
was
to
live
there
i
could
not
tell
since
my
funds
would
just
avail
to
land
me
on
the
spot
upon
reflection
it
could
scarce
be
out
of
the
into
the
fire
and
my
resolution
to
go
to
saint
louis
became
fixed
so
packing
up
my
i
stepped
on
board
the
steamboat
belle
of
the
west
bound
for
the
far
city
of
the
mounds
chapter
three
the
belle
of
the
west
i
was
on
board
at
the
advertised
time
but
punctuality
on
a
mississippi
steamboat
must
not
be
expected
and
i
found
myself
too
early
by
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
the
time
was
not
thrown
away
i
spent
it
to
some
profit
in
examining
the
peculiar
craft
in
which
i
had
embarked
i
say
for
the
steamers
employed
upon
the
mississippi
and
its
tributary
waters
are
unlike
those
of
any
other
country
even
unlike
those
in
use
in
the
atlantic
or
eastern
states
they
are
strictly
and
could
not
live
in
anything
like
a
rough
sea
though
the
reckless
owners
of
some
of
them
have
occasionally
risked
them
along
the
coast
from
mobile
to
galveston
texas
the
hull
is
built
like
that
of
a
sea
boat
but
differs
materially
from
the
latter
in
depth
of
hold
so
shallow
is
it
that
there
is
but
little
allowed
and
the
surface
of
the
main
deck
is
but
a
few
inches
above
the
indeed
when
the
boat
is
heavily
laden
the
waves
lip
over
the
gunwales
upon
the
deck
is
placed
the
machinery
and
there
rest
the
huge
boilers
and
the
grates
or
furnaces
necessarily
large
because
the
propelling
power
is
produced
from
logs
of
wood
there
also
most
of
the
freight
is
stowed
on
account
of
the
light
capacity
of
the
hold
and
on
every
part
not
occupied
by
the
machinery
and
boilers
may
be
seen
piles
of
hogsheads
of
tobacco
or
bags
of
corn
rising
to
the
height
of
many
feet
this
is
the
freight
of
a
on
the
return
trip
of
course
the
commodities
are
of
a
different
character
and
consist
of
boxes
of
yankee
furniture
farming
implements
and
notions
brought
round
by
ship
from
boston
coffee
in
bags
from
the
west
indies
rice
sugar
oranges
and
other
products
of
the
tropical
south
on
the
of
this
deck
is
a
space
allotted
to
the
humbler
class
of
travellers
known
as
deck
passengers
these
are
never
americans
some
are
labouring
irish
some
poor
german
emigrants
on
their
way
to
the
far
the
rest
are
negroes
free
or
more
generally
slaves
i
dismiss
the
hull
by
observing
that
there
is
a
good
reason
why
it
is
built
with
so
little
depth
of
hold
it
is
to
allow
the
boats
to
pass
the
shoal
water
in
many
parts
of
the
river
and
particularly
during
the
season
of
drought
for
such
purpose
the
lighter
the
draught
the
greater
the
advantage
and
a
mississippi
captain
boasting
of
the
capacity
of
his
boat
in
this
respect
declared
that
all
he
wanted
was
heavy
dew
upon
the
grass
to
enable
him
to
propel
her
across
the
if
there
is
but
little
of
a
mississippi
steamboat
under
the
water
the
reverse
is
true
of
what
may
be
seen
above
its
surface
fancy
a
house
some
two
hundred
feet
in
length
built
of
plank
and
painted
to
the
whiteness
of
snow
fancy
along
the
upper
story
a
row
of
windows
or
rather
doors
thickly
set
and
opening
out
upon
a
narrow
balcony
fancy
a
flattish
or
slightly
rounded
roof
covered
with
tarred
canvas
and
in
the
centre
a
range
of
like
glass
fancy
towering
above
all
two
enormous
black
cylinders
of
each
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
nearly
ten
times
as
high
the
funnels
of
the
boat
a
smaller
cylinder
to
one
side
the
a
tall
standing
up
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
bow
with
the
banner
flying
from
its
peak
fancy
all
these
and
you
may
form
some
idea
of
the
characteristic
features
of
a
steamboat
on
the
mississippi
enter
the
cabin
and
for
the
first
time
you
will
be
struck
with
the
novelty
of
the
scene
you
will
there
observe
a
splendid
saloon
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
in
length
richly
carpeted
and
adorned
throughout
you
will
note
the
elegance
of
the
furniture
costly
chairs
sofas
tables
and
lounges
you
will
note
the
walls
richly
gilded
and
adorned
with
appropriate
designs
the
crystal
chandeliers
suspended
from
the
ceiling
the
hundred
doors
that
lead
to
the
on
each
side
and
the
immense
of
stained
or
ornamental
glass
which
shuts
in
the
sacred
precinct
of
the
ladies
saloon
in
short
you
will
note
all
around
you
a
style
and
luxuriance
to
which
you
as
a
european
traveller
have
not
been
accustomed
you
have
only
read
of
such
a
scene
in
some
oriental
tale
in
mary
montagu
or
the
arabian
nights
and
yet
all
this
magnificence
is
sometimes
sadly
at
variance
with
the
style
of
the
company
that
occupies
it
for
this
splendid
saloon
is
as
much
the
property
of
the
coarse
rowdy
as
of
the
refined
gentleman
you
are
startled
by
the
apparition
of
a
rough
boot
elevated
along
the
edge
of
the
shining
mahogany
and
a
dash
of
brown
nicotian
juice
may
have
somewhat
altered
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
but
these
things
are
exceptional
more
exceptional
now
than
in
the
times
of
which
i
write
having
satisfied
myself
with
examining
the
interior
structure
of
the
belle
of
the
west
i
sauntered
out
in
front
of
the
cabin
here
a
large
open
space
usually
known
as
the
awning
forms
an
excellent
for
the
male
passengers
it
is
simply
the
continuation
of
the
projected
forward
and
supported
by
pillars
that
rest
upon
the
main
deck
below
the
roof
or
also
carried
forward
to
the
same
point
and
resting
on
slight
wooden
props
screens
this
part
from
sun
or
rain
and
a
low
running
around
it
renders
it
safe
being
open
in
front
and
at
both
sides
it
affords
the
best
view
and
having
the
advantage
of
a
cool
breeze
brought
about
by
the
motion
of
the
boat
is
usually
a
favourite
resort
a
number
of
chairs
are
here
placed
to
accommodate
the
passengers
and
smoking
is
permitted
he
must
take
very
little
interest
in
the
movements
of
human
life
who
can
not
kill
an
hour
by
observing
it
upon
the
levee
of
new
orleans
and
having
seated
myself
and
lighted
my
cigar
i
proceeded
to
spend
an
hour
in
that
interesting
occupation
chapter
four
the
rival
boats
the
part
of
the
levee
under
my
eyes
was
that
known
as
the
steamboat
landing
some
twenty
or
thirty
boats
lay
along
a
series
of
wooden
wharves
that
projected
slightly
into
the
river
some
had
just
arrived
from
towns
and
were
discharging
their
freight
and
passengers
at
this
season
a
scanty
list
others
surrounded
by
a
bustling
swarm
were
getting
up
steam
while
still
others
appeared
to
be
abandoned
by
both
officers
and
crew
who
were
no
doubt
at
the
time
enjoying
themselves
in
the
brilliant
cafes
and
restaurants
occasionally
might
be
seen
a
clerk
with
blue
cottonade
trowsers
white
linen
coat
costly
panama
hat
shirt
with
cambric
ruffles
and
diamond
studs
this
stylish
gentleman
would
appear
for
a
few
minutes
by
one
of
the
deserted
boats
perhaps
transact
a
little
business
with
some
one
and
then
hurry
off
again
to
his
more
pleasant
haunts
in
the
city
there
were
two
points
upon
the
levee
where
the
bustle
of
active
life
was
more
especially
observable
these
were
the
spaces
in
front
of
two
large
boats
one
was
that
on
which
i
had
taken
passage
the
other
as
i
could
read
upon
her
was
the
magnolia
the
latter
was
also
upon
the
eve
of
starting
as
i
could
tell
by
the
movements
of
her
people
by
the
red
fires
seen
in
her
furnaces
and
the
hissing
of
steam
that
every
now
and
then
screamed
sharply
from
the
direction
of
her
boilers
on
the
levee
directly
in
front
of
her
drays
were
depositing
their
last
loads
passengers
were
hurrying
forward
in
hand
in
fear
they
might
be
too
late
trunks
boxes
bags
and
barrels
were
being
rudely
pushed
or
rolled
over
the
the
clerks
armed
with
book
and
pencil
were
checking
them
off
and
everything
denoted
the
intention
of
a
speedy
departure
a
scene
exactly
similar
was
being
enacted
in
front
of
the
belle
of
the
west
i
had
not
been
regarding
these
movements
very
long
before
i
observed
that
there
was
something
unusual
in
the
wind
the
boats
lay
at
no
great
distance
from
each
other
and
their
crews
by
a
slight
elevation
of
voice
could
converse
this
they
were
freely
doing
and
from
some
expressions
that
reached
me
coupled
with
a
certain
tone
of
defiance
in
which
they
were
uttered
i
could
perceive
that
the
magnolia
and
the
belle
of
the
west
were
rival
boats
i
soon
gathered
the
further
information
that
they
were
about
to
start
at
the
same
time
and
that
a
race
was
in
contemplation
i
knew
that
this
was
no
unusual
occurrence
among
what
are
termed
crack
boats
and
both
the
belle
and
her
rival
came
under
that
category
both
were
of
the
in
size
and
magnificence
of
fitting
both
ran
in
the
same
trade
that
is
from
new
orleans
to
saint
louis
and
both
were
commanded
by
and
popular
river
captains
they
could
not
be
otherwise
than
rivals
and
this
feeling
was
shared
in
by
the
crews
of
both
from
captain
to
as
regards
the
owners
and
officers
in
such
cases
there
is
a
substantial
at
the
bottom
of
this
rivalry
the
boat
that
whips
in
one
of
these
races
wins
also
the
future
patronage
of
the
public
the
fast
boat
becomes
the
fashionable
boat
and
is
ever
afterwards
sure
of
a
strong
list
of
passengers
at
a
high
rate
of
fare
for
there
is
this
peculiarity
among
americans
many
of
them
will
spend
their
last
dollar
to
be
able
to
say
at
the
end
of
his
journey
that
he
came
upon
the
fashionable
boat
just
as
in
england
you
find
many
people
desirous
of
making
it
known
that
they
travelled
snobbery
is
peculiar
to
no
country
it
appears
to
be
universal
with
regard
to
the
contemplated
trial
of
speed
between
the
belle
of
the
west
and
the
magnolia
the
feeling
of
rivalry
pervaded
not
only
the
crews
of
both
boats
but
i
soon
discovered
that
the
passengers
were
affected
with
it
most
of
these
seemed
as
eager
for
the
race
as
an
english
blackleg
for
the
derby
some
no
doubt
looked
forward
to
the
sport
and
excitement
but
i
soon
perceived
that
the
greater
number
were
betting
upon
the
result
the
belle
boun
to
win
cried
a
fellow
at
my
shoulder
i
go
twenty
dollars
on
the
belle
will
you
bet
stranger
no
i
replied
somewhat
angrily
as
the
fellow
had
taken
a
liberty
by
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
well
retorted
he
jest
as
you
like
that
and
addressing
himself
to
some
one
else
he
continued
the
belle
the
conquering
boat
for
twenty
dollars
twenty
dollars
on
the
belle
i
confess
i
had
no
very
pleasant
reflections
at
that
moment
it
was
my
first
trip
upon
an
american
steamboat
and
my
memory
was
brimful
of
stories
of
boiler
burstings
snaggings
blowings
up
and
boats
on
fire
i
had
heard
that
these
races
not
infrequently
resulted
in
one
or
other
of
the
catastrophes
and
i
had
reason
to
know
that
my
information
was
correct
many
of
the
passengers
the
more
sober
and
respectable
ones
shared
my
feelings
and
some
talked
of
appealing
to
the
captain
not
to
allow
the
race
but
they
knew
they
were
in
the
minority
and
held
their
peace
i
had
made
up
my
mind
at
least
to
ask
the
captain
his
intentions
i
was
prompted
rather
by
curiosity
than
by
any
other
motive
i
left
my
seat
therefore
and
having
crossed
the
staging
walked
toward
the
top
of
the
wharf
where
this
gentleman
was
standing
chapter
five
a
desirable
before
i
had
entered
into
conversation
with
the
captain
i
saw
a
barouche
approaching
on
the
opposite
side
apparently
coming
from
the
french
quarter
of
the
city
it
was
a
handsome
equipage
driven
by
a
and
evidently
black
and
as
it
drew
near
i
could
perceive
that
it
was
occupied
by
a
young
and
lady
i
can
not
say
why
but
i
felt
a
presentiment
accompanied
perhaps
by
a
silent
wish
that
the
occupant
of
the
barouche
was
about
to
be
a
it
was
not
long
before
i
learnt
that
such
was
her
intention
the
barouche
drew
up
on
the
crest
of
the
levee
and
i
saw
the
lady
directing
some
inquiry
to
a
bystander
who
immediately
pointed
to
our
captain
the
latter
perceiving
that
he
was
the
object
inquired
after
stepped
up
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
bowed
to
the
lady
i
was
close
to
the
spot
and
every
word
reached
me
monsieur
are
you
the
captain
of
the
belle
of
the
west
the
lady
spoke
in
french
a
smattering
of
which
the
captain
in
his
intercourse
with
the
creoles
had
picked
up
yes
madame
was
the
reply
i
wish
to
take
passage
with
you
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
accommodate
you
madame
there
is
still
one
disengaged
i
believe
mr
shirley
here
the
captain
appealed
to
the
clerk
in
order
to
ascertain
if
such
was
the
case
never
mind
said
the
lady
interrupting
him
for
the
matter
of
a
it
is
of
no
importance
you
will
reach
my
plantation
before
midnight
and
therefore
i
shall
not
require
to
sleep
aboard
the
phrase
my
plantation
evidently
had
an
effect
upon
the
captain
naturally
not
a
rude
man
it
seemed
to
render
him
still
more
attentive
and
polite
the
proprietor
of
a
louisiana
plantation
is
a
somebody
not
to
be
treated
with
nonchalance
but
when
that
proprietor
chances
to
be
a
young
and
charming
lady
who
could
be
otherwise
than
amiable
not
captain
commander
of
the
belle
of
the
west
the
very
name
of
his
boat
negatived
the
presumption
smiling
blandly
he
inquired
where
he
was
to
land
his
fair
charge
at
bringiers
replied
the
lady
my
residence
is
a
little
below
but
our
landing
is
not
a
good
one
besides
there
is
some
freight
which
it
would
be
better
to
put
ashore
at
bringiers
here
the
occupant
of
the
barouche
pointed
to
a
train
of
drays
loaded
with
barrels
and
boxes
that
had
just
driven
up
and
halted
in
the
rear
of
the
carriage
the
sight
of
the
freight
had
a
still
further
pleasant
effect
on
the
captain
who
was
himself
of
his
boat
he
became
profuse
in
offers
of
service
and
expressed
his
willingness
to
accommodate
his
new
passenger
in
every
way
she
might
desire
monsieur
capitaine
continued
this
handsome
lady
still
remaining
seated
in
her
carriage
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
seriousness
i
must
make
one
condition
with
you
please
to
name
it
madame
well
then
it
is
reported
that
your
boat
is
likely
to
have
a
race
with
some
other
one
if
that
be
so
i
can
not
become
your
passenger
the
captain
looked
somewhat
disconcerted
the
fact
is
continued
she
i
had
a
narrow
escape
once
before
and
i
am
determined
to
run
no
such
risk
in
future
madame
stammered
the
captain
then
hesitating
oh
then
interrupted
the
lady
if
you
can
not
give
me
the
assurance
that
you
will
not
race
i
must
wait
for
some
other
boat
the
captain
hung
his
head
for
some
seconds
he
was
evidently
reflecting
upon
his
answer
to
be
thus
denied
the
anticipated
excitement
and
pleasure
of
the
race
the
victory
which
he
confidently
expected
and
its
grand
consequences
to
appear
as
it
were
afraid
of
trying
the
speed
of
his
boat
afraid
that
she
would
be
beaten
would
give
his
rival
a
large
opportunity
for
future
bragging
and
would
place
himself
in
no
enviable
light
in
the
eyes
of
his
crew
and
passengers
all
of
whom
had
already
made
up
their
minds
for
a
race
on
the
other
hand
to
refuse
the
request
of
the
lady
not
very
unreasonable
when
properly
viewed
and
still
more
reasonable
when
it
was
considered
that
that
lady
was
the
proprietress
of
several
of
freight
and
when
still
further
considered
that
that
lady
was
a
rich
of
the
french
coast
and
might
see
fit
next
fall
to
send
several
hundred
casks
of
sugar
and
as
many
hogsheads
of
tobacco
down
on
his
the
captain
boat
these
considerations
i
say
made
the
request
quite
reasonable
and
so
we
suppose
upon
reflection
it
must
have
appeared
to
captain
b
for
after
a
little
hesitation
he
granted
it
not
with
the
best
grace
however
it
evidently
cost
him
a
struggle
but
interest
prevailed
and
he
granted
it
i
accept
your
conditions
madame
the
boat
shall
run
i
give
you
my
promise
to
that
effect
thanks
monsieur
le
capitaine
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
have
my
freight
taken
aboard
the
carriage
goes
along
this
gentleman
is
my
steward
here
antoine
he
will
look
to
everything
and
now
pray
capitaine
when
do
you
contemplate
starting
in
fifteen
minutes
madame
at
the
latest
are
you
sure
of
that
mon
capitaine
she
inquired
with
a
significant
laugh
which
told
she
was
no
stranger
to
the
want
of
punctuality
of
the
boats
quite
sure
madame
replied
the
captain
you
may
depend
on
the
time
ah
then
i
shall
go
aboard
at
once
and
so
saying
she
lightly
tripped
down
the
steps
of
the
barouche
and
giving
her
arm
to
the
captain
who
had
gallantly
proffered
himself
was
conducted
to
the
ladies
cabin
and
of
course
for
a
time
lost
to
the
admiring
eyes
not
only
of
myself
but
of
a
goodly
number
of
others
who
had
already
been
attracted
to
gaze
upon
this
beautiful
apparition
chapter
six
antoine
the
steward
i
had
been
very
much
struck
by
the
appearance
of
this
dame
not
so
much
on
account
of
her
physical
beauty
though
that
was
of
a
rare
kind
as
by
the
air
that
characterised
her
i
should
feel
a
difficulty
in
describing
this
which
consisted
in
a
certain
that
bespoke
courage
and
there
was
no
coarseness
of
manner
only
the
levity
of
a
heart
gay
as
summer
and
light
as
gossamer
but
capable
when
occasion
required
of
exhibiting
a
wonderful
boldness
and
strength
she
was
a
woman
that
would
be
termed
beautiful
in
any
country
but
with
her
beauty
there
was
combined
elegance
both
in
dress
and
manner
that
told
you
at
once
she
was
a
lady
accustomed
to
society
and
the
world
and
this
although
still
young
she
certainly
could
not
have
been
much
over
twenty
louisiana
has
a
precocious
climate
however
and
a
creole
of
twenty
will
count
for
an
englishwoman
of
ten
years
older
was
she
married
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
so
besides
the
expressions
my
plantation
and
my
steward
would
scarcely
have
been
used
by
a
lady
who
had
somebody
at
home
unless
indeed
that
somebody
were
held
in
very
low
estimation
in
short
considered
a
nobody
a
widow
she
might
be
a
very
young
widow
but
even
that
did
not
seem
to
me
probable
she
had
not
the
cut
of
a
widow
in
my
eyes
and
there
was
not
the
semblance
of
a
weed
either
about
her
dress
or
her
looks
the
captain
had
styled
her
but
he
was
evidently
unacquainted
with
her
and
also
with
the
french
idiom
in
a
doubtful
case
such
as
this
it
should
have
been
mademoiselle
inexperienced
as
i
was
at
the
time
green
as
the
americans
have
it
i
was
not
without
some
curiosity
in
regard
to
women
especially
when
these
chanced
to
be
beautiful
my
curiosity
in
the
present
case
had
been
stimulated
by
several
circumstances
first
by
the
attractive
loveliness
of
the
lady
herself
second
by
the
style
of
her
conversation
and
the
facts
it
had
revealed
third
by
the
circumstance
that
the
lady
was
or
i
fancied
her
to
be
a
creole
i
had
as
yet
had
but
little
intercourse
with
people
of
this
peculiar
race
and
was
somewhat
curious
to
know
more
about
them
i
had
found
them
by
no
means
ready
to
open
their
doors
to
the
saxon
stranger
especially
the
old
creole
who
even
to
this
hour
regard
their
somewhat
in
the
light
of
invaders
and
usurpers
this
feeling
was
at
one
time
deeply
rooted
with
time
however
it
is
dying
out
a
fourth
spur
to
my
curiosity
was
found
in
the
fact
that
the
lady
in
passing
had
eyed
me
with
a
glance
of
more
than
ordinary
inquisitiveness
do
not
be
too
hasty
in
blaming
me
for
this
declaration
hear
me
first
i
did
not
for
a
moment
fancy
that
that
glance
was
one
of
admiration
i
had
no
such
thoughts
i
was
too
young
at
the
time
to
flatter
myself
with
such
fancies
besides
at
that
precise
moment
i
was
far
from
being
in
my
zenith
with
scarce
five
dollars
in
my
purse
i
felt
rather
forlorn
and
how
could
i
have
fancied
that
a
brilliant
beauty
such
as
she
a
star
of
first
magnitude
a
rich
proprietress
the
owner
of
a
plantation
a
steward
and
a
host
of
slaves
would
condescend
to
look
admiringly
on
such
a
friendless
wretch
as
i
in
truth
i
did
not
flatter
myself
with
such
thoughts
i
supposed
that
it
was
simple
curiosity
on
her
part
and
no
more
she
saw
that
i
was
not
of
her
own
race
my
complexion
the
colour
of
my
eyes
the
cut
of
my
garments
perhaps
something
in
my
manner
told
her
i
was
a
stranger
to
the
soil
and
that
had
excited
her
interest
for
a
passing
moment
a
mere
ethnological
reflection
nothing
more
the
act
however
had
helped
to
pique
my
curiosity
and
i
felt
desirous
of
knowing
at
least
the
name
of
this
distinguished
creature
the
steward
thought
i
may
serve
my
purpose
and
i
turned
towards
that
individual
he
was
a
tall
lathy
old
frenchman
and
sufficiently
to
have
passed
for
the
lady
father
his
aspect
too
was
quite
venerable
giving
you
the
idea
of
long
service
and
a
very
old
family
i
saw
as
i
approached
him
that
my
chances
were
but
indifferent
i
found
him
as
close
as
a
clam
our
conversation
was
very
brief
his
answers
laconic
monsieur
may
i
ask
who
is
your
mistress
a
lady
true
any
one
may
tell
that
who
has
the
good
fortune
of
looking
at
her
it
was
her
name
i
asked
for
it
does
not
concern
you
to
know
it
not
if
it
be
of
so
much
importance
to
keep
it
a
secret
this
exclamation
muttered
rather
than
spoken
aloud
ended
the
dialogue
and
the
old
fellow
turned
away
on
giving
expression
to
it
no
doubt
cursing
me
in
his
heart
as
a
meddling
yankee
i
applied
myself
to
the
sable
jehu
of
the
barouche
but
with
no
better
success
he
was
getting
his
horses
aboard
and
not
liking
to
give
direct
answers
to
my
questions
he
dodged
them
by
dodging
around
his
horses
and
appearing
to
be
very
busy
on
the
offside
even
the
i
was
unable
to
get
out
of
him
and
i
also
gave
up
in
despair
the
name
however
was
furnished
me
shortly
after
from
an
unexpected
source
i
had
returned
to
the
boat
and
had
seated
myself
once
more
under
the
awning
watching
the
boatmen
with
red
shirts
use
their
brawny
arms
in
getting
their
freight
aboard
i
saw
it
was
the
same
which
had
been
delivered
from
the
drays
the
property
of
the
lady
it
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
barrels
of
pork
and
flour
with
a
quantity
of
dried
hams
and
some
bags
of
coffee
provisions
for
her
large
establishment
soliloquised
i
just
then
some
packages
of
a
different
character
were
pushed
upon
the
staging
these
were
leathern
trunks
travelling
bags
rosewood
cases
and
the
like
ha
her
personal
luggage
i
again
reflected
and
continued
to
puff
my
cigar
regarding
the
transfer
of
the
trunks
my
eye
was
suddenly
attracted
to
some
lettering
that
appeared
upon
one
of
the
packages
a
leathern
portmanteau
i
sprang
from
my
seat
and
as
the
article
was
carried
up
the
gangway
stair
i
met
it
halfway
i
glanced
my
eye
over
the
lettering
and
read
eugenie
chapter
seven
the
starting
the
last
bell
rings
the
folks
rush
ashore
the
is
drawn
in
some
heedless
wight
has
to
jump
for
it
the
cable
is
pulled
aboard
and
coiled
the
engineer
bell
tinkles
the
great
wheels
revolve
lashing
the
brown
water
into
foam
the
steam
whistles
and
screams
at
the
boilers
and
booms
from
the
in
regular
repetitions
neighbouring
boats
are
pressed
out
of
their
places
their
planks
cringe
and
crackle
guards
are
broken
or
the
slight
timbers
of
causing
a
of
curses
between
the
crews
and
after
some
minutes
of
this
pandemoniac
confusion
the
huge
craft
clears
herself
and
rides
out
upon
the
broad
bosom
of
the
river
she
heads
a
few
strokes
of
the
revolving
paddles
and
the
current
is
mastered
and
the
noble
boat
yielding
to
the
mighty
propulsion
cleaves
her
liquid
way
walking
the
water
like
a
thing
of
life
perchance
the
boom
of
a
cannon
announces
her
departure
perchance
it
is
animated
by
the
harmonious
swell
of
brazen
instruments
or
still
more
appropriate
some
old
boatman
song
with
its
lively
chorus
is
heard
issuing
from
the
rude
though
not
unmusical
throats
of
the
hands
below
lafayette
and
carrolton
are
soon
passed
the
humbler
roofs
of
stores
and
dwellings
sink
out
of
sight
and
the
noble
dome
of
saint
charles
the
spires
of
churches
and
the
towers
of
the
great
cathedral
are
all
of
the
crescent
city
that
remain
above
the
horizon
these
at
length
go
down
and
the
floating
palace
moves
on
in
stately
grandeur
between
the
picturesque
shores
of
the
mississippi
i
have
said
picturesque
this
word
does
not
satisfy
me
nor
can
i
think
of
one
that
will
delineate
my
idea
i
must
make
use
of
a
phrase
picturesquely
beautiful
to
express
my
admiration
of
the
scenery
of
those
shores
i
have
no
hesitation
in
pronouncing
it
the
finest
in
the
world
i
am
not
gazing
upon
it
with
a
mere
cold
i
can
not
separate
scenery
from
its
associations
not
its
associations
of
the
past
but
with
the
present
i
look
upon
the
ruined
castles
of
the
rhine
and
their
story
impresses
me
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
for
what
i
look
upon
its
modern
homes
and
their
dwellers
i
am
equally
filled
with
disgust
for
what
in
the
bay
of
naples
i
experience
a
similar
feeling
and
roaming
around
the
lordly
parks
of
england
i
see
them
through
an
enclosure
of
wretchedness
and
rags
till
their
loveliness
seems
an
illusion
here
alone
upon
the
banks
of
this
majestic
river
do
i
behold
wealth
widely
diffused
intelligence
broadcast
and
comfort
for
all
here
in
almost
every
house
do
i
meet
the
refined
taste
of
high
civilisation
the
hospitality
of
generous
hearts
combined
with
the
power
to
dispense
it
here
can
i
converse
with
men
by
thousands
whose
souls
are
free
not
politically
alone
but
free
from
vulgar
error
and
fanatic
superstition
here
in
short
have
i
witnessed
not
the
perfectedness
for
that
belongs
to
a
far
future
time
but
the
most
advanced
stage
of
civilisation
yet
reached
upon
the
globe
a
dark
shadow
crosses
my
and
my
heart
is
stung
with
sudden
pain
it
is
the
shadow
of
a
human
being
with
a
black
skin
is
a
for
a
moment
or
two
the
scene
looks
black
what
is
there
to
admire
here
in
these
fields
of
golden
of
waving
maize
of
cotton
what
to
admire
in
those
grand
mansions
with
their
orangeries
their
flowery
gardens
their
drooping
and
their
soft
arbours
all
this
is
but
the
sweat
of
the
slave
for
a
while
i
behold
without
admiring
the
scene
has
lost
its
de
and
a
gloomy
wilderness
is
before
me
i
reflect
slowly
and
gradually
the
cloud
passes
away
and
the
brightness
returns
i
reflect
and
compare
true
he
with
the
black
skin
is
a
slave
but
not
a
slave
that
is
a
difference
in
his
favour
at
least
in
other
lands
mine
own
among
them
i
see
around
me
slaves
as
well
and
far
more
numerous
not
the
slaves
of
an
individual
but
of
an
association
of
individuals
a
class
an
oligarchy
not
slaves
of
the
corvee
serfs
of
the
feud
but
victims
of
its
modern
representative
the
tax
which
is
simply
its
commutation
and
equally
baneful
in
its
effects
on
my
soul
i
hold
that
the
slavery
of
the
louisiana
black
is
less
degrading
than
that
of
the
white
pleb
of
england
the
poor
helot
is
the
victim
of
conquest
and
may
claim
to
place
himself
in
the
honourable
category
of
a
prisoner
of
war
he
has
not
willed
his
own
bondage
while
you
my
grocer
and
butcher
and
baker
ay
and
you
my
fine
city
merchant
who
fondly
fancy
yourself
a
freeman
ye
are
voluntary
in
your
serfdom
ye
are
loyal
to
a
political
juggle
that
annually
robs
ye
of
half
your
year
industry
that
annually
requires
some
hundred
thousands
of
your
class
to
be
sloughed
off
into
exile
lest
your
whole
body
should
gangrene
and
die
and
all
this
without
even
a
protest
nay
worse
you
are
ever
ready
to
cry
crucify
to
him
who
would
attempt
to
counteract
this
condition
ever
ready
to
glorify
the
man
and
the
motion
that
would
fix
another
rivet
in
your
fetters
even
while
i
write
the
man
who
loves
you
least
he
who
for
forty
years
for
all
his
life
in
fact
has
been
your
systematic
enemy
is
the
most
popular
of
your
rulers
even
while
i
write
the
roman
wheel
is
revolving
before
your
eyes
squibs
and
crackers
sound
sweetly
in
your
ears
and
you
are
screaming
forth
your
rejoicings
over
the
acts
of
a
convention
that
had
for
its
sole
object
the
strengthening
of
your
chains
but
a
short
twelve
months
ago
you
were
just
as
enthusiastic
for
a
war
that
was
equally
antagonistic
to
your
interests
equally
hostile
to
the
liberties
of
your
kind
miserable
delusion
i
repeat
what
i
have
uttered
with
a
feeling
of
solemnity
on
my
soul
i
hold
that
the
slavery
of
the
louisiana
black
is
less
degrading
than
that
of
the
white
pleb
of
england
true
this
black
man
is
a
and
there
are
three
millions
of
his
race
in
the
same
condition
painful
thought
but
less
painful
when
accompanied
by
the
reflection
that
the
same
broad
land
is
trodden
by
millions
of
free
and
sovereign
three
millions
of
slaves
to
twenty
millions
of
masters
in
mine
own
land
the
proportion
is
exactly
reversed
the
truth
may
be
obscure
for
all
that
i
dare
say
there
are
some
who
will
understand
it
ah
how
pleasant
to
turn
from
these
but
painful
thoughts
to
the
calmer
contemplation
of
themes
furnished
by
science
and
nature
how
sweet
was
it
to
study
the
many
novel
forms
that
presented
themselves
to
my
eyes
on
the
shores
of
that
magnificent
stream
there
is
a
pleasaunce
even
in
the
retrospect
and
as
i
now
sit
dreaming
over
them
far
away
perhaps
never
more
to
behold
them
with
mortal
eye
i
am
consoled
by
a
fond
and
faithful
memory
whose
magic
power
enables
me
to
recall
them
before
the
eye
of
my
mind
in
all
their
vivid
colouring
of
green
and
gold
chapter
eight
the
coast
of
the
mississippi
as
soon
as
we
had
fairly
started
i
ascended
to
the
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
scenery
through
which
we
were
passing
in
this
place
i
was
alone
for
the
silent
pilot
boxed
up
in
his
little
tower
of
glass
could
hardly
be
called
a
companion
i
make
the
following
observations
the
breadth
of
the
mississippi
river
has
been
much
exaggerated
it
is
here
about
half
a
mile
wide
sometimes
more
occasionally
less
this
average
width
it
preserves
for
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
its
mouth
its
waters
run
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
miles
to
the
hour
and
are
of
a
yellowish
cast
with
a
slight
tincture
of
red
the
yellow
colour
it
derives
from
the
missouri
while
the
deeper
tint
is
obtained
by
the
influx
of
the
red
driftwood
floats
thickly
upon
its
surface
here
in
single
logs
there
in
clusters
to
run
a
boat
against
one
of
these
is
attended
with
danger
and
the
pilot
avoids
them
sometimes
one
swimming
below
the
surface
escapes
his
eye
and
then
a
heavy
bumping
against
the
bows
shakes
the
boat
and
startles
the
equanimity
of
the
less
experienced
passengers
the
snag
is
most
dreaded
that
is
a
dead
tree
with
heavy
roots
still
adhering
these
from
their
weight
have
settled
upon
the
bottom
and
the
gathering
around
holds
them
firmly
imbedded
the
lighter
top
riven
of
its
branches
rises
towards
the
surface
but
the
pressure
of
the
current
prevents
it
from
attaining
to
the
perpendicular
and
it
is
held
in
a
slanting
position
when
its
top
rises
above
the
water
the
danger
is
but
trifling
unless
in
a
very
dark
night
it
is
when
the
top
is
hidden
a
foot
or
two
below
the
surface
that
the
snag
is
feared
then
a
boat
running
upon
it
is
lost
to
a
certainty
the
roots
firmly
imbedded
in
the
bottom
mud
prevent
the
pile
from
yielding
and
the
top
usually
a
spiky
one
penetrates
the
bow
timbers
of
the
boat
sinking
her
almost
instantly
a
boat
properly
snagged
will
go
down
in
a
few
minutes
the
sawyer
is
a
log
fixed
in
the
water
similarly
to
the
snag
but
kept
bobbing
up
and
down
by
the
current
thus
suggesting
the
idea
of
a
sawyer
engaged
at
his
work
hence
the
name
a
boat
getting
aground
upon
a
sunken
log
is
sometimes
snagged
upon
its
branches
and
sometimes
broken
into
two
pieces
by
the
pressure
of
her
own
weight
among
the
drift
i
notice
odd
matters
that
interest
me
stalks
of
that
have
been
crushed
in
the
a
hundred
miles
farther
up
i
should
not
meet
these
leaves
and
stems
of
the
maize
plant
pieces
of
broken
tufts
of
raw
cotton
split
now
and
then
the
carcase
of
some
animal
with
a
buzzard
or
black
vulture
and
perched
upon
it
or
hovering
above
i
am
within
the
geographical
range
of
the
alligator
but
here
the
great
saurian
is
seldom
seen
he
prefers
the
more
sluggish
or
the
streams
whose
shores
are
still
wild
in
the
rapid
current
of
the
mississippi
and
along
its
banks
he
is
but
rarely
observed
by
the
passing
traveller
alternately
the
boat
approaches
both
shores
of
the
river
coasts
they
are
called
the
land
is
an
alluvion
of
no
very
ancient
formation
it
is
a
mere
strip
of
varying
in
breadth
from
a
few
hundred
yards
to
several
miles
and
gradually
declining
from
the
banks
so
that
the
river
is
actually
running
along
the
top
of
a
ridge
beyond
this
strip
commences
the
swamp
a
tract
that
is
annually
inundated
and
consists
of
a
series
of
lagoons
and
marshes
covered
with
coarse
grass
and
reeds
this
extends
in
some
places
for
a
score
of
miles
or
even
farther
a
complete
wilderness
of
morass
some
portions
of
this
where
the
inundation
is
only
annual
are
covered
with
dark
and
almost
impenetrable
forests
between
the
cultivated
strip
on
the
immediate
bank
of
the
river
and
the
swamp
in
the
rear
runs
a
belt
of
this
forest
which
forms
a
kind
of
background
to
the
picture
answering
to
the
in
other
lands
it
is
a
high
dark
forest
principally
composed
of
but
there
are
other
kinds
peculiar
to
this
soil
such
as
the
the
the
tupelo
the
the
with
and
various
species
of
cornus
juglans
and
oaks
here
an
underwood
of
palmettoes
palms
and
various
species
of
there
thick
brakes
of
cane
grow
among
the
trees
while
from
their
branches
is
suspended
in
long
festoons
that
singular
parasite
the
spanish
moss
imparting
a
sombre
character
to
the
forest
between
this
dank
forest
and
the
lie
the
cultivated
fields
the
river
current
is
often
several
feet
above
their
level
but
they
are
protected
by
the
levee
an
artificial
embankment
which
has
been
formed
on
both
sides
of
the
river
to
a
distance
of
several
hundred
miles
from
its
mouth
in
these
fields
i
observe
the
culture
of
the
of
the
of
tobacco
and
cotton
of
indigo
and
maize
i
see
the
gangs
of
black
slaves
at
their
work
in
their
cotton
dresses
of
striped
and
gaudy
colours
in
which
predominates
i
see
huge
waggons
drawn
by
mules
or
oxen
returning
from
the
or
slowly
toiling
along
the
banks
i
see
the
creole
in
cottonade
jacket
and
trousers
of
bright
blue
mounted
upon
his
small
spanish
horse
and
galloping
along
the
levee
road
i
see
the
grand
mansion
of
the
planter
with
its
and
gardens
its
green
venetians
cool
verandahs
and
pretty
palings
i
see
the
huge
or
or
cotton
pickery
and
there
too
are
the
neat
cabins
clustering
together
or
running
in
a
row
like
the
at
a
fashionable
now
we
are
passing
a
plantation
where
they
are
making
merry
a
many
horses
stand
under
the
trees
hitched
in
the
shade
with
saddles
on
not
a
few
of
which
are
ladies
saddles
in
the
verandah
the
lawn
and
through
the
orange
shrubbery
may
be
seen
moving
about
gentlemen
and
ladies
richly
attired
music
is
heard
and
there
is
dancing
in
the
open
air
one
can
not
help
envying
these
happy
creoles
the
enjoyment
of
their
arcadian
life
scenes
varied
and
lovely
were
passing
before
my
eyes
lost
in
admiration
of
them
i
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
chapter
nine
eugenie
besancon
no
eugenie
besancon
was
not
forgotten
every
now
and
then
her
form
flitted
before
my
imagination
and
i
could
not
help
associating
it
with
the
scenery
through
which
we
were
passing
and
amidst
which
no
doubt
she
was
born
and
nurtured
its
fair
the
glimpse
of
the
where
several
girls
were
conspicuous
brought
her
more
forcibly
into
my
thoughts
and
descending
from
the
i
entered
the
cabin
with
some
curiosity
once
more
to
look
upon
this
interesting
lady
for
some
time
i
dreaded
disappointment
the
great
glass
of
the
ladies
cabin
was
closed
and
although
there
were
several
ladies
outside
in
the
main
saloon
the
creole
was
not
among
the
number
the
ladies
cabin
which
occupies
the
of
the
boat
is
a
sacred
precinct
into
which
bachelors
are
admitted
only
when
they
enjoy
the
privilege
of
having
a
friend
inside
then
only
at
certain
hours
i
was
not
one
of
the
privileged
out
of
the
hundred
and
odd
passengers
on
board
i
did
not
know
a
soul
male
or
female
and
i
had
the
happiness
or
misfortune
of
being
equally
unknown
to
them
under
these
circumstances
my
entry
into
the
ladies
cabin
would
have
been
deemed
an
intrusion
and
i
sat
down
in
the
main
saloon
and
occupied
myself
in
studying
the
physiognomy
and
noting
the
movements
of
my
they
were
a
mixed
throng
some
were
wealthy
merchants
bankers
money
or
commission
brokers
from
new
orleans
with
their
wives
and
daughters
on
their
annual
migration
to
the
north
to
escape
from
the
yellow
fever
and
indulge
in
the
more
pleasant
epidemic
of
life
at
a
fashionable
there
were
corn
and
from
the
on
their
return
home
and
storekeepers
from
the
towns
boatmen
who
in
jean
trousers
and
red
flannel
shirts
had
pushed
a
flat
two
thousand
miles
down
stream
and
who
were
now
making
the
back
trip
in
shining
broadcloth
and
linen
what
lions
would
these
be
on
getting
back
to
their
homes
about
the
sources
of
salt
river
the
cumberland
the
licking
or
the
miami
there
were
creoles
too
old
of
the
french
quarter
and
their
families
the
men
distinguished
by
a
superabundance
of
ruffles
plaited
pantaloons
shining
jewellery
and
cloth
boots
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
clerks
privileged
to
leave
new
orleans
in
the
dull
season
and
there
were
some
still
more
gentlemen
with
the
finest
of
cloth
in
their
coats
the
whitest
of
linen
and
raffles
the
brightest
of
diamonds
in
their
studs
and
the
most
massive
of
these
last
were
sportsmen
they
had
already
fathered
around
a
table
in
the
and
were
fingering
a
span
new
pack
of
cards
the
implements
of
their
peculiar
industry
among
these
i
observed
the
fellow
who
had
so
loudly
challenged
me
to
bet
upon
the
he
had
passed
me
several
times
regarding
me
with
a
glance
that
appeared
anything
but
friendly
our
close
friend
the
steward
was
seated
in
the
saloon
you
must
not
suppose
that
his
holding
the
office
of
steward
or
overseer
disentitled
him
to
the
privileges
of
the
cabin
there
is
no
second
saloon
on
board
an
american
steamer
such
a
distinction
is
not
known
so
far
west
as
the
mississippi
the
overseers
of
plantations
are
usually
men
of
rude
and
brutal
dispositions
the
very
nature
of
their
calling
makes
them
so
this
frenchman
however
seemed
to
be
an
exception
he
appeared
a
most
respectable
old
gentleman
i
rather
liked
his
looks
and
began
to
feel
quite
an
interest
in
him
though
he
by
no
means
appeared
to
reciprocate
the
feeling
some
one
complained
of
the
mosquitoes
and
suggested
the
opening
of
the
of
the
ladies
cabin
this
suggestion
was
backed
up
by
several
others
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
clerk
of
the
boat
is
the
man
charged
with
such
responsibilities
he
was
at
length
appealed
to
the
appeal
was
reasonable
it
was
successful
and
the
great
gates
of
the
steamboat
paradise
were
thrown
open
the
result
was
a
current
of
air
which
swept
through
the
long
saloon
from
stem
to
stern
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
not
a
mosquito
remained
on
board
except
such
as
had
escaped
the
blast
by
taking
shelter
in
the
this
was
certainly
a
great
relief
the
were
permitted
to
remain
open
an
arrangement
quite
satisfactory
to
all
but
particularly
to
a
number
of
the
young
clerks
who
could
now
command
a
full
view
of
the
interior
of
the
harem
several
of
them
might
be
observed
taking
advantage
of
the
new
arrangement
not
staring
broadly
as
that
would
be
accounted
rude
and
noted
against
them
they
only
appealed
to
the
sacred
shrine
by
or
over
books
which
they
pretended
to
read
or
pacing
up
and
down
approached
the
favoured
limit
glancing
in
at
intervals
as
if
undesignedly
some
appeared
to
have
acquaintances
inside
though
not
upon
terms
of
sufficient
familiarity
to
give
them
the
right
of
entry
others
were
in
hopes
of
making
acquaintances
should
opportunity
offer
i
could
detect
expressive
looks
and
occasionally
a
smile
that
seemed
to
denote
a
mutual
intelligence
many
a
pleasant
thought
is
conveyed
without
words
the
tongue
is
often
a
sad
disenchanter
i
have
known
it
to
spoil
many
a
nice
silently
conceived
and
almost
ripe
for
being
carried
out
i
was
amused
at
this
speechless
pantomime
and
sat
for
some
minutes
regarding
it
my
eyes
wandered
at
intervals
towards
the
interior
of
the
ladies
saloon
guided
thither
partly
by
a
common
curiosity
i
have
an
observant
habit
anything
new
interests
me
and
this
on
an
american
steamboat
was
entirely
new
and
not
a
little
i
desired
to
study
it
perhaps
i
was
somewhat
interested
in
another
way
desirous
of
having
one
more
look
at
the
young
creole
besancon
my
desire
then
was
gratified
i
saw
the
lady
at
last
she
had
come
out
of
her
and
was
moving
around
the
saloon
graceful
and
gay
she
was
now
unbonneted
and
her
rich
golden
tresses
were
arranged
la
a
creole
fashion
as
well
the
thick
masses
coiled
into
a
large
club
at
the
back
of
the
head
denoted
the
luxuriance
of
her
hair
and
the
style
of
coiffure
displaying
her
noble
forehead
and
neck
became
her
well
fair
hair
with
blonde
complexion
although
rare
among
the
creoles
is
sometimes
met
with
dark
hair
with
a
brunette
skin
is
the
rule
to
which
eugenie
besancon
was
a
remarkable
exception
her
features
expressed
gaiety
approaching
to
volatility
yet
one
could
not
help
feeling
that
there
was
firmness
of
character
her
figure
was
beyond
criticism
and
the
face
if
not
strikingly
beautiful
was
one
that
you
could
not
look
upon
without
emotions
of
pleasure
she
appeared
to
know
some
of
her
at
least
she
was
conversing
with
them
in
a
style
of
easy
freedom
women
however
rarely
exhibit
embarrassment
among
themselves
women
of
french
race
never
one
thing
i
observed
her
cabin
companions
appeared
to
regard
her
with
deference
perhaps
they
had
already
learnt
that
the
handsome
carriage
and
horses
belonged
to
her
that
was
very
very
likely
i
continued
to
gaze
upon
this
interesting
lady
girl
i
can
not
call
her
for
although
young
enough
she
had
the
air
of
a
woman
a
woman
of
experience
she
appeared
quite
at
ease
seemed
mistress
of
herself
and
indeed
of
everything
else
what
an
air
of
thought
i
that
woman
is
not
in
love
i
can
not
tell
why
i
should
have
made
these
reflections
or
why
the
thought
pleased
me
but
certainly
it
did
why
she
was
nothing
to
me
she
was
far
above
me
i
dared
scarce
look
upon
her
i
regarded
her
as
some
superior
being
and
with
timid
stolen
glances
as
i
would
regard
beauty
in
a
church
ho
she
was
nothing
to
me
in
another
hour
it
would
be
night
and
she
was
to
land
in
the
night
i
should
never
see
her
again
i
should
think
of
her
though
for
an
hour
or
two
perhaps
for
a
day
the
longer
that
was
now
foolish
enough
to
sit
gazing
upon
her
i
was
weaving
a
net
for
myself
a
little
agony
that
might
last
for
some
time
after
she
was
gone
i
had
formed
a
resolution
to
withdraw
from
the
fascinating
influence
and
return
to
my
meditation
on
the
a
last
look
at
the
fair
creole
and
i
should
depart
just
at
that
moment
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
it
was
of
the
kind
known
as
a
and
its
motions
displayed
the
fine
proportion
and
outlines
of
her
form
as
she
now
sat
she
was
facing
the
door
and
her
eye
for
the
first
time
rested
upon
me
by
heavens
she
was
gazing
on
me
just
as
before
what
meant
that
strange
glance
those
burning
eyes
stedfast
and
fixed
they
remained
bent
upon
mine
and
mine
trembled
to
answer
them
thus
for
some
moments
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
me
without
motion
or
change
of
direction
i
was
too
young
at
that
time
to
understand
the
expression
that
was
in
them
i
could
translate
such
an
one
afterwards
but
not
then
at
length
she
rose
from
her
seat
with
an
air
of
uneasiness
as
if
displeased
either
with
herself
or
me
and
turning
away
her
head
she
opened
the
latticed
door
and
passed
into
her
had
i
done
anything
to
give
offence
no
not
by
word
nor
look
nor
gesture
i
had
not
spoken
i
had
not
moved
and
my
timid
glance
could
not
have
been
construed
into
one
of
rudeness
i
was
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
conduct
of
mademoiselle
besancon
and
in
the
full
belief
that
i
should
never
see
her
again
i
hurried
away
from
the
saloon
and
once
more
climbed
up
to
the
chapter
ten
a
new
mode
of
raising
the
steam
it
was
near
sunset
the
fiery
disc
was
going
down
behind
the
dark
outline
of
cypress
forest
that
belted
the
western
horizon
and
a
yellow
light
fell
upon
the
river
promenading
back
and
forward
upon
the
roof
i
was
gazing
upon
the
scene
wrapt
in
admiration
of
its
glowing
beauty
my
reverie
was
interrupted
on
looking
down
the
river
i
saw
that
a
large
boat
was
in
our
wake
and
coming
rapidly
after
us
the
volume
of
smoke
rolling
up
out
of
her
tall
funnels
and
the
red
glowing
of
her
fires
showed
that
she
was
moving
under
a
full
head
of
steam
her
size
as
well
as
the
loud
reports
of
her
told
that
she
was
a
boat
of
the
she
was
the
magnolia
she
was
moving
with
great
velocity
and
i
had
not
watched
her
long
before
i
perceived
that
she
was
fast
gaining
upon
us
at
this
moment
my
ears
were
assailed
by
a
variety
of
sounds
coming
from
below
loud
voices
in
earnest
tones
the
stamping
and
pattering
of
feet
as
of
men
rushing
over
the
wooden
decks
and
along
the
the
voices
of
women
too
were
mingled
in
the
medley
i
surmised
what
all
this
meant
the
approach
of
the
rival
boat
was
the
cause
of
the
excitement
up
to
this
time
the
seemed
to
have
been
nearly
forgotten
it
had
got
abroad
among
both
hands
and
passengers
that
the
captain
did
not
intend
to
run
and
although
this
had
been
loudly
censured
at
first
the
feeling
of
disappointment
had
partially
subsided
the
crew
had
been
busy
at
their
work
of
stowage
the
firemen
with
their
huge
billets
of
the
gamblers
with
their
cards
and
the
passengers
in
general
with
their
portmanteaus
or
the
journal
of
the
day
the
other
boat
not
starting
at
the
same
time
had
been
out
of
sight
until
now
and
the
feeling
of
rivalry
almost
out
of
mind
the
appearance
of
the
rival
produced
a
sudden
change
the
gamblers
flung
down
the
pack
in
hopes
of
having
something
more
exciting
to
bet
upon
the
readers
hastily
closed
their
books
and
tossed
aside
their
newspapers
the
rummagers
of
trunks
banged
down
the
lids
the
fair
occupants
of
suddenly
sprang
to
their
feet
and
all
ran
out
of
the
cabins
and
pressed
towards
the
of
the
boat
my
position
on
the
was
the
best
possible
for
a
good
view
of
the
rival
boat
and
i
was
soon
joined
by
a
number
of
my
i
wished
however
to
witness
the
scene
on
the
and
went
below
on
reaching
the
main
saloon
i
found
it
quite
forsaken
all
the
passengers
both
male
and
female
had
gone
out
upon
the
and
leaning
against
the
guards
were
anxiously
watching
the
approach
of
the
magnolia
i
found
the
captain
under
the
awning
he
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
all
of
whom
appeared
to
be
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
one
after
the
other
was
proffering
speech
to
him
they
were
urging
him
to
raise
the
steam
the
captain
evidently
wishing
to
escape
from
these
importunities
kept
passing
from
place
to
place
it
was
to
no
purpose
wherever
he
went
he
was
met
or
followed
by
a
knot
of
individuals
all
with
the
same
request
in
their
mouths
some
even
begging
him
for
god
sake
not
to
let
the
magnolia
pass
him
wal
cap
cried
one
if
the
belle
do
run
i
guess
she
never
be
heerd
of
on
these
waters
agin
she
wo
you
right
added
another
for
my
part
the
next
trip
i
make
try
the
magnolia
she
a
fast
boat
that
magnolia
remarked
a
third
she
ai
anything
else
rejoined
the
first
speaker
she
got
her
steam
on
a
few
i
reckon
i
walked
out
on
the
in
the
direction
of
the
ladies
cabin
the
inmates
of
the
latter
were
clustered
along
the
guards
and
seemingly
as
much
interested
in
the
as
the
men
i
could
hear
several
of
them
expressing
their
wishes
aloud
that
the
boats
would
run
all
idea
of
risk
or
fear
of
consequences
had
departed
and
i
believe
that
if
the
company
had
been
polled
at
the
moment
in
favour
of
the
race
there
would
not
have
been
three
dissentient
voices
i
confess
that
i
myself
would
have
voted
for
running
i
had
caught
the
infection
and
no
longer
thought
of
snags
sawyers
or
bursting
boilers
as
the
magnolia
drew
near
the
excitement
increased
it
was
evident
that
in
a
few
minutes
more
she
would
be
alongside
and
then
pass
us
the
idea
was
unsupportable
to
some
of
the
passengers
and
loud
words
could
be
heard
now
and
then
interspersed
with
an
angry
oath
the
poor
captain
had
to
bear
all
this
for
it
was
known
that
the
rest
of
the
officers
were
well
disposed
for
a
trial
of
speed
it
was
the
captain
only
who
showed
the
white
feather
the
magnolia
was
close
in
our
wake
her
head
bearing
a
little
to
one
side
she
was
evidently
preparing
to
pass
us
her
officers
and
crew
were
moving
actively
about
both
pilots
were
seen
above
at
the
the
firemen
were
all
at
work
upon
the
deck
the
were
glowing
and
the
bright
blaze
stood
several
feet
above
the
tops
of
her
tall
funnels
one
might
have
fancied
she
was
on
fire
they
are
burning
bacon
hams
shouted
a
voice
they
are
by
exclaimed
another
see
yonder
a
pile
of
them
in
front
of
the
furnace
i
turned
my
eyes
in
that
direction
it
was
quite
true
a
mass
of
objects
lay
upon
the
deck
in
front
of
the
fires
their
size
shape
and
colour
told
what
they
were
dried
hams
of
bacon
the
firemen
were
seen
taking
them
from
the
pile
and
thrusting
them
one
after
another
up
the
red
tunnels
of
the
furnace
the
magnolia
was
still
gaining
upon
us
already
her
head
was
even
with
the
of
the
belle
on
the
latter
boat
the
excitement
increased
and
the
noise
along
with
it
an
occasional
taunt
from
the
passengers
of
the
rival
boat
added
fuel
to
the
flame
and
the
captain
was
once
more
abjured
to
run
men
almost
threatened
him
with
violence
the
magnolia
continued
to
advance
she
was
now
head
for
head
with
us
another
minute
passed
a
minute
of
deep
silence
the
crews
and
passengers
of
both
boats
watched
their
progress
with
hearts
too
full
for
utterance
another
minute
and
the
magnolia
had
shot
ahead
a
triumphant
cheer
rang
along
her
decks
mingled
with
taunting
shouts
and
expressions
of
insult
throw
us
a
line
and
we
tow
you
cried
one
whar
yer
old
ark
now
shouted
another
hurraw
for
the
magnolia
three
groans
for
the
belle
of
the
west
three
groans
for
the
old
dugout
vociferated
a
third
amidst
jeers
and
shouts
of
laughter
i
can
hardly
describe
the
mortification
felt
by
those
on
board
the
belle
it
was
not
confined
to
the
officers
and
crew
the
passengers
one
and
all
seemed
to
partake
of
the
feeling
i
shared
it
myself
more
than
i
could
have
believed
to
be
possible
one
dislikes
to
be
among
the
conquered
even
on
any
terms
of
association
besides
one
involuntarily
catches
the
impulse
of
the
moment
the
sentiment
that
surrounds
you
perhaps
by
physical
laws
which
you
can
not
resist
for
the
moment
becomes
your
own
and
even
when
you
know
the
object
of
exultation
to
be
worthless
or
absurd
you
are
controlled
by
the
electric
current
to
join
in
the
enthusiasm
i
remember
once
being
thus
carried
away
and
mingled
my
voice
with
the
rude
throats
that
cheered
the
passing
cortege
of
royalty
the
moment
it
was
past
however
my
heart
fell
abashed
at
its
own
meanness
and
wickedness
both
his
crew
and
passengers
seemed
to
think
our
captain
imprudent
in
his
prudence
and
a
general
clamour
mingled
with
cries
of
shame
was
heard
all
over
the
boat
the
poor
captain
i
had
my
eyes
upon
him
all
this
while
i
really
pitied
him
i
was
perhaps
the
only
passenger
on
board
beside
the
fair
creole
who
knew
his
secret
and
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
chivalric
fortitude
with
which
he
kept
it
to
himself
i
saw
his
cheek
glow
and
his
eye
sparkle
with
vexation
and
i
felt
satisfied
that
had
he
been
called
upon
to
make
that
promise
then
he
would
not
have
done
so
for
the
privilege
of
carrying
all
the
freight
upon
the
river
just
then
as
if
to
escape
the
importunities
that
beset
him
i
saw
him
steal
back
and
pass
through
the
ladies
cabin
there
he
was
at
once
recognised
and
a
general
onset
was
made
upon
him
by
his
fair
passengers
who
were
almost
as
noisy
in
their
petitions
as
the
men
several
threatened
him
laughingly
that
they
would
never
travel
by
his
boat
again
while
others
accused
him
of
a
want
of
gallantry
surely
it
was
impossible
to
resist
such
banterings
and
i
watched
the
captain
closely
expecting
a
crisis
one
way
or
the
other
the
crisis
was
at
hand
drawing
himself
up
in
the
midst
of
a
knot
of
these
importunates
he
thus
addressed
them
ladies
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
to
gratify
you
but
before
leaving
new
orleans
i
gave
my
promise
in
fact
passed
my
word
of
honour
to
a
lady
here
the
gallant
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
young
lady
who
rushing
up
from
another
part
of
the
boat
cried
out
oh
capitaine
cher
capitaine
do
not
let
that
wicked
boat
get
ahead
of
us
do
put
on
more
steam
and
pass
her
that
is
a
dear
captain
why
mademoiselle
replied
the
captain
in
astonishment
it
was
to
you
i
gave
the
promise
not
to
run
it
was
pardieu
exclaimed
mademoiselle
besancon
for
it
was
she
so
you
did
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
oh
cher
capitaine
i
release
you
from
that
promise
i
hope
it
is
not
too
late
for
heaven
sake
try
to
pass
her
les
how
they
taunt
us
the
captain
face
brightened
up
for
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
resumed
its
vexed
expression
he
replied
mademoiselle
although
grateful
to
you
i
regret
to
say
that
under
the
circumstances
i
can
not
hope
to
run
successfully
against
the
magnolia
we
are
not
on
equal
terms
is
burning
bacon
of
which
she
has
a
large
supply
i
should
have
had
the
same
but
after
promising
you
not
to
run
i
of
course
did
not
take
any
on
board
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
a
race
with
only
common
unless
indeed
the
belle
be
much
the
faster
boat
which
we
do
not
yet
know
as
we
have
never
tried
her
speed
here
appeared
to
be
a
dilemma
and
some
of
the
ladies
regarded
mademoiselle
besancon
with
looks
of
displeasure
bacon
hams
she
exclaimed
bacon
hams
did
you
say
cher
capitaine
how
many
would
be
enough
would
two
hundred
be
enough
oh
less
than
that
replied
the
captain
here
antoine
antoine
continued
she
calling
to
the
old
steward
how
many
bacon
hams
have
you
on
board
ten
barrels
of
them
mademoiselle
answered
the
steward
bowing
respectfully
ten
barrels
that
will
do
i
suppose
cher
capitaine
they
are
at
your
service
mademoiselle
i
shall
pay
you
for
them
said
the
captain
brightening
up
and
becoming
imbued
with
the
general
enthusiasm
no
no
no
let
the
expense
be
mine
i
have
hindered
you
they
were
for
my
plantation
people
but
they
are
not
in
want
we
shall
send
down
for
more
go
antoine
go
to
the
firemen
knock
in
the
heads
of
the
barrels
use
them
as
you
please
but
do
not
let
us
be
beaten
by
that
wicked
magnolia
hark
how
they
cheer
ha
we
shall
pass
them
yet
so
saying
the
fiery
creole
rushed
back
to
the
followed
by
a
group
of
admirers
the
captain
dander
was
now
fairly
up
and
the
story
of
the
bacon
hams
soon
spreading
over
the
boat
still
further
heightened
the
enthusiasm
of
both
passengers
and
crew
three
loud
cheers
were
given
for
the
young
lady
which
seemed
to
mystify
the
magnolians
who
had
now
been
for
some
time
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
triumph
and
had
forged
a
considerable
distance
ahead
all
hands
went
to
work
with
a
will
the
barrels
were
their
heads
knocked
in
and
part
of
their
contents
chucked
up
the
blazing
furnace
the
iron
walls
soon
grew
red
the
steam
rose
the
boat
trembled
under
the
increased
action
of
the
engine
the
bells
of
the
engineers
tinkled
their
signals
the
wheels
revolved
more
rapidly
and
an
increase
of
velocity
was
soon
perceptible
hope
had
stifled
clamour
comparative
silence
was
restored
there
was
heard
only
an
occasional
utterance
the
expression
of
an
opinion
upon
the
speed
of
the
rival
boats
the
fixing
the
conditions
of
a
bet
and
now
and
then
some
allusion
to
the
story
of
the
bacon
hams
at
intervals
all
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
water
eagerly
glancing
along
the
line
that
separated
the
rival
steamers
chapter
eleven
a
upon
the
mississippi
it
had
now
become
quite
dark
there
was
no
moon
in
the
sky
not
a
speck
of
a
star
a
clear
heaven
over
the
lower
region
of
the
mississippi
at
night
is
rather
rare
than
otherwise
the
film
of
the
swamp
too
often
obscures
it
there
was
light
enough
for
the
race
the
yellow
water
shone
clear
it
was
easily
distinguishable
from
the
land
the
track
was
a
wide
one
and
the
pilots
of
both
boats
old
hands
knew
every
shute
and
of
the
river
the
rival
steamers
were
quite
visible
to
one
another
no
lamps
needed
to
be
hung
out
although
the
gaff
over
the
bow
of
each
boat
carried
its
coloured
signal
the
cabin
windows
of
both
were
full
of
light
and
the
blaze
of
the
bacon
fires
flung
a
vermilion
glare
far
over
the
water
upon
each
boat
the
spectators
could
be
seen
from
the
other
in
their
windows
or
leaning
against
the
guards
in
attitudes
that
betokened
their
interest
by
the
time
the
belle
had
fairly
got
up
steam
the
magnolia
was
a
full
in
advance
of
her
this
distance
though
nothing
where
there
is
a
large
difference
of
speed
is
not
so
easily
overtaken
where
the
swiftness
of
the
boats
approximates
to
anything
like
an
equality
it
was
a
long
while
therefore
before
the
people
of
the
belle
could
be
certain
as
to
whether
she
was
gaining
upon
her
rival
for
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
tell
this
when
one
vessel
is
running
in
the
wake
of
the
other
questions
were
put
by
passengers
to
the
various
officials
and
to
one
another
and
guesses
were
continually
being
made
on
this
interesting
point
at
length
an
assurance
was
derived
from
the
captain
that
several
hundred
yards
had
been
already
taken
up
this
produced
general
joy
though
not
for
there
were
some
unpatriotic
individuals
on
board
the
belle
who
had
risked
their
dollars
on
the
magnolia
in
another
hour
however
it
was
clear
to
all
that
our
boat
was
fast
gaining
upon
the
magnolia
as
she
was
now
within
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
her
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
smooth
water
appears
but
a
short
distance
and
the
people
of
the
two
boats
could
hold
converse
at
will
the
opportunity
was
not
neglected
by
those
of
the
belle
to
pay
back
the
boasts
of
the
magnolians
shouts
of
banter
reached
their
ears
and
their
former
taunts
were
now
returned
with
interest
have
you
any
message
for
saint
louis
we
going
up
there
and
will
be
happy
to
carry
it
for
you
shouted
one
from
the
belle
hurraw
for
the
belle
vociferated
another
how
are
you
off
for
bacon
hams
asked
a
third
we
can
lend
you
a
few
if
you
out
where
shall
we
say
we
left
you
inquired
a
fourth
in
bend
and
loud
peals
of
laughter
followed
this
joking
allusion
to
a
point
in
the
river
to
the
boatmen
it
had
now
approached
the
hour
of
midnight
and
not
a
soul
on
either
boat
had
thought
of
retiring
to
rest
the
interest
in
the
race
precluded
the
idea
of
sleep
and
both
men
and
women
stood
outside
the
cabins
or
glided
out
and
in
at
short
intervals
to
note
the
progress
the
excitement
had
led
to
drinking
and
i
noticed
that
several
of
the
passengers
were
already
half
intoxicated
the
officers
too
led
on
by
those
were
indulging
too
freely
and
even
the
captain
showed
symptoms
of
a
similar
condition
no
one
thought
of
censure
prudence
had
fled
from
the
boat
it
is
near
midnight
and
amidst
the
growling
and
grinding
of
the
machinery
the
boats
are
moving
on
there
is
deep
darkness
upon
the
water
but
this
is
no
impediment
the
red
fires
glow
the
blaze
stands
high
above
the
tall
funnels
steam
booms
from
the
iron
pipes
the
huge
paddles
lash
the
water
into
foam
the
timbers
creak
and
tremble
under
the
fierce
pressure
and
the
boats
move
on
it
is
near
midnight
a
space
of
two
hundred
yards
alone
separates
the
steamers
the
belle
is
bounding
upon
the
waves
of
the
magnolia
in
less
than
ten
minutes
her
head
will
overlap
the
stern
of
her
rival
in
less
than
twenty
and
the
cheer
of
victory
rising
from
her
deck
will
peal
from
shore
to
shore
i
was
standing
by
the
captain
of
our
boat
regarding
him
not
without
a
feeling
of
solicitude
i
regretted
to
see
him
pass
so
often
to
the
bar
he
was
drinking
deeply
he
had
returned
to
his
station
by
the
and
was
gazing
ahead
some
straggling
lights
were
gleaming
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
a
mile
farther
up
the
sight
of
these
caused
him
to
start
and
utter
a
wild
exclamation
by
heavens
it
is
drawled
the
pilot
at
his
elbow
we
reached
it
in
quick
time
i
reckon
great
god
i
must
lose
the
race
how
said
the
other
not
comprehending
him
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
must
land
there
i
must
i
must
the
lady
who
gave
us
the
hams
i
must
land
her
oh
replied
the
phlegmatic
pilot
a
darned
pity
it
is
he
added
but
if
you
must
you
must
darn
the
luck
we
them
into
shucks
in
another
quarter
i
reckon
darn
the
luck
we
must
give
it
up
said
the
captain
turn
her
head
in
saying
this
he
hurried
below
and
observing
his
excited
manner
i
followed
him
a
group
of
ladies
stood
upon
the
where
the
captain
descended
over
the
the
creole
was
among
them
mademoiselle
said
the
captain
addressing
himself
to
this
lady
we
must
lose
the
race
after
all
why
asked
she
in
surprise
are
there
not
enough
antoine
have
you
delivered
them
all
no
mademoiselle
replied
the
captain
it
is
not
that
thanks
to
your
generosity
you
see
those
lights
yes
well
that
is
oh
it
is
is
it
yes
and
of
course
you
must
be
landed
there
and
that
would
lose
you
the
race
certainly
then
of
course
i
must
be
landed
there
what
care
i
for
a
day
i
am
not
so
old
but
that
i
can
spare
one
ha
ha
ha
you
shall
not
lose
your
race
and
the
reputation
of
your
fine
boat
on
my
account
think
not
of
landing
cher
capitaine
take
me
on
to
baton
rouge
i
can
get
back
in
the
morning
a
cheer
rose
from
the
auditory
and
the
captain
rushing
back
to
the
pilot
countermanded
his
late
order
the
belle
again
stands
in
the
wake
of
the
magnolia
and
again
scarce
two
hundred
yards
of
the
river
lie
between
the
rumbling
of
their
machinery
the
booming
of
their
steam
the
plashing
of
their
paddles
the
creaking
of
their
planks
the
shouts
of
those
on
board
mingle
in
rude
concert
up
forges
the
belle
up
up
gaining
in
spite
of
the
throes
of
her
antagonist
up
nearer
still
nearer
till
her
head
laps
upon
the
stern
then
the
then
the
foredeck
of
the
magnolia
now
the
lights
of
both
cross
each
other
their
fires
glow
together
upon
the
water
they
are
head
and
head
another
foot
is
gained
the
captain
waves
his
hat
and
the
cheer
of
triumph
peals
forth
that
cheer
was
never
finished
its
first
notes
had
scarce
broke
upon
the
midnight
air
when
it
was
interrupted
by
an
explosion
like
the
bursting
of
some
vast
magazine
an
explosion
that
shook
the
air
the
earth
and
the
water
timbers
crashed
and
flew
upward
men
shouted
as
their
bodies
were
projected
to
the
heavens
smoke
and
vapour
filled
the
air
and
one
wild
cry
of
agony
arose
upon
the
night
chapter
twelve
the
the
concussion
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
heard
was
nevertheless
significant
of
the
nature
of
the
catastrophe
i
felt
an
instantaneous
conviction
that
the
boilers
had
burst
and
such
in
reality
was
the
fact
at
the
moment
i
chanced
to
be
on
the
balcony
in
rear
of
my
i
was
holding
by
the
else
the
shock
and
the
sudden
lurch
of
the
boat
would
have
flung
me
headlong
scarce
knowing
what
i
did
i
staggered
into
my
and
through
the
opposite
door
into
the
main
saloon
here
i
paused
and
looked
around
me
the
whole
forward
part
of
the
boat
was
shrouded
in
steam
and
smoke
and
already
a
portion
of
the
hot
scalding
vapour
floated
through
the
cabin
dreading
the
contact
of
this
i
rushed
aft
but
by
a
fortunate
chance
the
lurch
of
the
boat
had
brought
her
stern
to
windward
and
the
breeze
blew
the
dangerous
element
away
the
engine
was
now
silent
the
wheels
had
ceased
to
move
the
no
longer
gave
out
its
booming
notes
but
instead
of
these
sounds
others
of
terrible
import
fell
upon
the
ear
the
shouts
of
men
mingled
with
oaths
wild
awful
imprecations
the
more
shrill
piercing
shrieks
of
women
the
groans
of
rounded
from
the
deck
below
the
agonised
cry
of
those
blown
into
the
water
and
drowning
all
rang
upon
the
ear
with
terrible
emphasis
how
changed
the
tones
from
those
that
but
a
moment
before
pealed
from
the
lips
the
smoky
vapour
was
soon
partially
blown
off
and
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
there
a
complete
chaos
met
the
eye
the
the
bar
with
its
contents
the
front
awning
and
part
of
the
starboard
were
completely
carried
away
blown
up
as
if
a
mine
had
been
sprung
beneath
them
and
the
huge
funnels
had
fallen
forward
upon
the
deck
at
a
glance
i
was
convinced
that
captain
pilots
all
who
had
been
upon
that
part
of
the
boat
must
have
perished
of
course
such
reflections
passed
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
itself
and
occupied
me
not
a
moment
of
time
i
felt
that
was
still
unhurt
and
my
first
natural
thought
was
that
of
preserving
my
life
i
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
know
there
was
no
danger
of
a
second
explosion
but
i
perceived
that
the
boat
was
badly
injured
and
already
leaning
to
one
side
how
long
would
she
swim
i
had
hardly
asked
myself
the
question
when
it
was
answered
by
a
voice
that
in
terrified
accents
shouted
out
good
god
she
is
sinking
she
is
sinking
this
announcement
was
almost
simultaneous
with
the
cry
of
fire
and
at
the
same
moment
flames
were
seen
bursting
forth
and
shooting
up
to
the
height
of
the
whether
by
burning
up
or
going
down
it
was
evident
the
wreck
would
afford
us
but
short
refuge
the
thoughts
of
the
survivors
were
now
turned
to
the
magnolia
i
looked
in
the
direction
of
that
boat
i
perceived
that
she
was
doing
her
best
to
back
and
put
round
toward
us
but
she
was
still
several
hundred
yards
off
in
consequence
of
the
belle
having
steered
a
while
towards
the
bringiers
landing
the
boats
no
longer
ran
in
the
same
track
and
although
they
were
head
and
head
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
they
were
separated
from
each
other
by
a
wide
stretch
of
the
river
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
appeared
the
magnolia
and
it
was
evident
that
a
considerable
time
must
elapse
before
she
could
get
alongside
would
the
wreck
of
the
belle
keep
afloat
so
long
at
a
glance
i
was
convinced
it
would
not
i
felt
it
settling
down
under
my
feet
inch
by
inch
and
the
blaze
already
threatened
the
of
the
boat
licking
the
light
of
the
gaudy
saloon
as
if
it
had
been
flax
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
we
must
take
voluntarily
to
the
water
be
drawn
in
by
the
sinking
wreck
or
driven
to
it
by
the
fire
one
of
the
three
was
inevitable
you
will
fancy
me
to
have
been
in
a
state
of
extreme
terror
at
this
moment
such
however
was
not
the
case
i
had
not
the
slightest
fear
for
my
own
safety
not
that
i
was
redeemed
from
the
common
lot
by
any
superior
courage
but
simply
that
i
had
confidence
my
though
sufficiently
reckless
in
my
temperament
i
have
never
been
a
fatalist
i
have
saved
my
life
more
than
once
by
acts
of
volition
by
presence
of
mind
and
adroitness
the
knowledge
of
this
has
freed
me
from
the
superstitions
of
and
fatalism
and
therefore
when
not
too
indolent
i
take
precautions
against
danger
i
had
done
so
on
the
occasion
of
which
i
am
writing
in
my
portmanteau
i
carried
i
do
so
habitually
a
very
simple
contrivance
a
i
always
carry
it
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
ready
to
the
hand
it
is
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
adjust
this
and
with
it
around
my
body
i
feel
no
fear
of
being
plunged
into
the
broadest
river
or
even
a
channel
of
the
sea
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
and
not
any
superior
courage
that
supported
me
i
ran
back
to
my
the
portmanteau
was
open
and
in
another
moment
i
held
the
piece
of
quilted
cork
in
my
hands
in
a
few
seconds
its
strap
was
over
my
head
and
the
strings
securely
knotted
around
my
waist
thus
accoutred
i
stood
the
intending
to
remain
there
till
the
wreck
should
sink
nearer
the
surface
of
the
water
settling
rapidly
as
it
was
i
was
convinced
i
should
not
have
long
to
wait
i
closed
the
inner
door
of
the
room
and
turned
the
bolt
the
outer
one
i
held
slightly
ajar
my
hand
firmly
clutching
the
handle
i
had
my
object
in
thus
shutting
myself
up
i
should
be
less
exposed
to
the
view
of
the
wretches
that
ran
to
and
fro
like
spectres
for
any
fear
i
now
had
was
of
not
of
the
water
i
knew
that
should
the
be
discovered
i
should
have
a
crowd
around
me
in
a
moment
in
fact
that
escape
by
such
means
would
be
hopeless
dozens
would
follow
me
into
the
water
would
cling
to
my
limbs
would
drag
me
in
their
despairing
grasp
to
the
bottom
i
knew
this
and
clutching
the
venetian
door
with
firmer
grasp
i
stood
peering
through
the
apertures
in
stealthy
silence
chapter
thirteen
blesse
i
had
not
been
in
this
position
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
some
figures
appeared
in
front
of
the
door
and
voices
fell
upon
my
ear
that
i
thought
i
recognised
another
glance
revealed
the
speakers
they
were
the
young
creole
and
her
steward
the
conversation
passing
between
them
was
not
a
dialogue
but
a
series
of
exclamations
the
hurried
language
of
terror
the
old
man
had
got
together
a
few
cabin
chairs
and
with
trembling
hands
was
endeavouring
to
bind
them
together
with
the
design
of
forming
a
raft
he
had
no
other
cord
than
a
handkerchief
and
some
strips
of
silk
which
his
young
mistress
was
tearing
from
her
dress
it
would
have
been
but
a
feeble
raft
had
it
been
completed
not
fit
to
have
floated
a
cat
it
was
but
the
effort
of
the
drowning
man
catching
at
straws
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
would
afford
to
neither
of
them
the
respite
of
a
minute
life
the
chairs
were
of
heavy
rosewood
and
perchance
would
have
gone
to
the
bottom
of
themselves
the
scene
produced
upon
me
an
impression
indescribably
strange
i
felt
myself
standing
upon
a
crisis
i
felt
called
upon
to
choose
between
self
and
had
the
choice
left
no
chance
of
saving
my
own
life
i
fear
i
should
have
obeyed
the
first
law
of
nature
but
as
already
stated
of
my
own
life
i
felt
secure
the
question
was
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
me
also
to
save
the
lady
i
reasoned
rapidly
and
as
follows
the
a
very
small
one
will
not
sustain
us
both
what
if
i
fasten
it
upon
her
and
swim
alongside
a
little
help
from
it
now
and
then
will
be
sufficient
to
keep
me
afloat
i
am
a
good
swimmer
how
far
is
it
to
the
shore
i
looked
in
that
direction
the
glare
of
the
blazing
boat
lit
up
the
water
to
a
wide
circumference
i
could
see
the
brown
bank
distinctly
it
was
full
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
with
a
sharp
running
between
it
and
the
wreck
surely
i
can
swim
it
thought
i
sink
or
swim
i
shall
make
the
attempt
to
save
her
i
will
not
deny
that
other
reflections
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
was
forming
this
resolve
i
will
not
deny
that
there
was
a
little
gallantry
mixed
up
with
better
motives
instead
of
being
young
and
lovely
had
mademoiselle
besancon
been
old
and
plain
i
think
that
is
i
i
fear
she
would
have
been
left
to
antoine
and
his
raft
of
chairs
as
it
was
my
resolve
was
made
and
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
upon
motives
mademoiselle
besancon
i
called
out
of
the
door
ha
some
one
calls
me
said
she
turning
suddenly
mon
dieu
who
is
there
one
who
mademoiselle
muttered
the
old
steward
angrily
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
my
face
he
was
under
the
belief
that
i
wished
to
share
his
raft
he
repeated
not
carry
two
monsieur
nor
one
i
replied
mademoiselle
i
continued
addressing
myself
to
the
lady
those
chairs
will
not
serve
they
will
rather
be
the
means
of
drowning
you
here
take
this
it
will
save
your
life
as
i
spoke
i
had
pulled
off
the
preserver
and
held
it
towards
her
what
is
this
she
inquired
hastily
and
then
comprehending
all
she
continued
no
no
no
monsieur
yourself
yourself
i
believe
i
can
swim
ashore
without
it
take
it
mademoiselle
quick
quick
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
in
three
minutes
the
boat
will
go
down
the
other
is
not
near
yet
besides
she
may
fear
to
approach
the
fire
see
the
flames
they
come
this
way
quick
permit
me
to
fasten
it
for
you
my
god
my
god
generous
stranger
no
words
now
now
it
is
on
now
to
the
water
have
no
fear
plunge
in
and
strike
out
from
the
wreck
fear
not
i
shall
follow
and
guide
you
away
the
girl
partly
influenced
by
terror
and
partly
yielding
to
my
remonstrances
sprang
off
into
the
water
and
the
next
moment
i
saw
her
body
afloat
distinguishable
by
the
whitish
drapery
of
her
dress
that
still
kept
above
the
surface
at
that
instant
i
felt
some
one
grasping
me
by
the
hand
i
turned
round
it
was
antoine
forgive
me
noble
youth
forgive
me
he
cried
while
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
i
would
have
replied
but
at
the
moment
i
perceived
a
man
rush
forward
to
the
guards
over
which
the
girl
had
just
passed
i
could
see
that
his
eye
was
fixed
upon
her
and
that
he
had
marked
the
his
intention
was
evident
he
had
mounted
the
and
was
just
springing
off
as
i
reached
the
spot
i
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
drew
him
back
as
i
did
so
his
face
came
under
the
blaze
and
i
recognised
my
betting
bully
not
so
fast
sir
said
i
still
holding
him
he
uttered
but
one
word
in
reply
and
that
was
a
fearful
oath
but
at
the
moment
i
saw
in
his
uplifted
hand
the
shining
blade
of
a
so
unexpectedly
did
this
weapon
appear
that
i
had
no
chance
of
evading
the
blow
and
the
next
moment
i
felt
the
cold
steel
passing
through
my
arm
it
was
not
a
fatal
stab
however
and
before
the
brute
could
repeat
it
i
had
in
the
phraseology
of
the
ring
planted
a
blow
upon
his
chin
that
sent
him
sprawling
over
the
chairs
while
at
the
same
time
the
knife
flew
out
of
his
grasp
this
i
caught
up
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
whether
to
use
it
upon
the
ruffian
but
my
better
feelings
overcame
my
passion
and
i
flung
the
weapon
into
the
river
almost
instantaneously
i
plunged
after
i
had
no
time
to
tarry
the
blaze
had
reached
the
close
to
which
we
were
and
the
heat
was
no
longer
to
be
borne
my
last
glance
at
the
spot
showed
me
antoine
and
my
antagonist
struggling
among
the
chairs
the
white
drapery
served
me
for
a
beacon
and
i
swam
after
it
the
current
had
already
carried
it
some
distance
from
the
boat
and
directly
down
stream
i
had
hurriedly
divested
myself
of
coat
and
boots
and
as
my
other
garments
were
of
light
material
they
did
not
impede
me
after
a
few
strokes
i
swam
perfectly
free
and
keeping
the
white
dress
before
my
eyes
i
continued
on
down
the
river
now
and
then
i
raised
my
head
above
the
surface
and
looked
back
i
still
had
fears
that
the
ruffian
might
follow
and
i
had
nerved
myself
for
a
struggle
in
the
water
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
alongside
my
and
after
hurried
words
of
encouragement
i
laid
hold
of
her
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
endeavoured
to
direct
our
course
towards
the
shore
in
this
way
the
current
carried
us
in
a
diagonal
line
but
we
still
floated
down
stream
at
a
rapid
rate
a
long
and
weary
swim
it
seemed
to
me
had
it
been
much
longer
i
never
should
have
reached
the
end
of
it
at
length
we
appeared
to
be
near
the
bank
but
as
we
approached
it
my
strokes
became
feebler
and
my
left
hand
grasped
my
companion
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
effort
i
remember
reaching
land
however
i
remember
crawling
up
the
bank
with
great
difficulty
my
companion
assisting
me
i
remember
seeing
a
large
house
directly
in
front
of
where
we
had
come
ashore
i
remember
hearing
the
words
drole
ma
maison
i
remember
staggering
across
a
road
led
by
a
soft
hand
and
entering
a
gate
and
a
garden
where
there
were
benches
and
statues
and
flowers
i
remember
seeing
servants
come
from
the
house
with
lights
and
that
my
arms
were
red
and
my
sleeves
dripping
with
blood
i
remember
from
a
female
voice
the
cry
followed
by
a
wild
shriek
and
of
that
scene
i
remember
no
more
chapter
fourteen
where
am
i
when
i
awoke
to
consciousness
it
was
day
a
bright
sun
was
pouring
his
yellow
light
across
the
floor
of
my
chamber
and
from
the
diagonal
slanting
of
the
beam
i
could
perceive
that
it
was
either
very
early
in
the
morning
or
near
sunset
but
birds
were
singing
without
it
must
be
morning
reasoned
i
perceived
that
i
was
upon
a
low
couch
of
elegant
construction
without
curtains
but
in
their
stead
a
spread
its
gauzy
meshes
above
and
around
me
the
colour
and
fineness
of
the
linen
the
silken
gloss
of
the
counterpane
and
the
soft
yielding
mattress
beneath
imparted
to
me
the
knowledge
that
i
lay
upon
a
luxurious
bed
but
for
its
extreme
elegance
and
fineness
i
might
not
have
noticed
this
for
i
awoke
to
a
sense
of
severe
bodily
pain
the
incidents
of
the
preceding
night
soon
came
into
my
memory
and
passed
rapidly
one
by
one
as
they
had
occurred
up
to
our
reaching
the
bank
of
the
river
and
climbing
out
of
the
water
they
were
all
clear
enough
beyond
that
time
i
could
recall
nothing
distinctly
a
house
a
large
gateway
a
garden
trees
flowers
statues
lights
black
servants
were
all
jumbled
together
on
my
memory
there
was
an
impression
on
my
mind
of
having
beheld
amid
this
confusion
a
face
of
extraordinary
beauty
the
face
of
a
lovely
girl
something
angelic
it
seemed
but
whether
it
had
been
a
real
face
that
i
had
seen
or
only
the
vision
of
a
dream
i
could
not
now
tell
and
yet
its
lineaments
were
still
before
me
so
plainly
visible
to
the
eye
of
my
mind
so
clearly
outlined
that
had
i
been
an
artist
i
could
have
portrayed
them
the
face
alone
i
could
remember
nothing
else
i
remembered
it
as
the
his
dream
or
as
one
remembers
a
beautiful
face
seen
during
an
hour
of
intoxication
when
all
else
is
forgotten
strange
to
say
i
did
not
associate
this
face
with
my
companion
of
the
night
and
my
remembrance
painted
it
not
at
all
like
that
of
eugenie
besancon
was
there
any
one
besides
any
one
on
board
the
boat
that
my
dream
resembled
no
not
one
i
could
not
think
of
one
there
was
none
in
whom
i
had
taken
even
a
momentary
interest
with
the
exception
of
the
creole
but
the
lineaments
my
fancy
or
memory
now
conjured
up
were
entirely
unlike
to
hers
in
fact
of
quite
an
opposite
character
before
my
mind
eye
hung
masses
of
glossy
black
hair
waving
along
the
brows
and
falling
over
the
shoulders
in
curling
clusters
within
this
ebon
framework
were
features
to
mock
the
sculptor
chisel
the
mouth
with
its
delicate
ellipse
the
nose
with
smooth
straight
outline
and
small
recurvant
nostril
the
arching
brows
of
jet
the
long
fringes
upon
the
eyelids
all
were
vividly
before
me
and
all
unlike
the
features
of
eugenie
besancon
the
colour
of
the
skin
too
even
that
was
different
it
was
not
that
circassian
white
that
characterised
the
complexion
of
the
creole
but
a
colour
equally
clear
though
tinged
with
a
blending
of
brown
and
olive
which
gave
to
the
red
upon
the
cheeks
a
tint
of
crimson
the
eye
i
fancied
or
remembered
well
better
than
aught
else
it
was
large
rounded
and
of
colour
but
its
peculiarity
consisted
in
a
certain
expression
strange
but
lovely
its
brilliance
was
extreme
but
it
neither
flashed
nor
sparkled
it
was
more
like
a
gorgeous
gem
viewed
by
the
spectator
while
at
rest
its
light
did
not
blaze
it
seemed
rather
to
burn
despite
some
pain
which
i
felt
i
lay
for
many
minutes
pondering
over
this
lovely
portrait
and
wondering
whether
it
was
a
memory
or
a
dream
a
singular
reflection
crossed
my
mind
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
such
a
face
were
real
i
could
forget
mademoiselle
besancon
despite
the
romantic
incident
that
had
attended
our
introduction
the
pain
of
my
arm
at
length
dissipated
the
beautiful
vision
and
recalled
me
to
my
present
situation
on
throwing
back
the
counterpane
i
observed
with
surprise
that
the
wound
had
been
dressed
and
evidently
by
a
surgeon
satisfied
on
this
head
i
cast
my
eye
abroad
to
make
a
reconnoissance
of
my
quarters
the
room
i
occupied
was
small
but
notwithstanding
the
obstruction
of
the
mosquito
bar
i
could
see
that
it
was
furnished
with
taste
and
elegance
the
furniture
was
light
mostly
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
matting
of
finely
woven
and
stained
into
various
colours
the
windows
were
garnished
with
curtains
of
silk
damask
and
muslin
corresponding
to
the
colour
of
the
a
table
richly
inlaid
was
near
the
centre
of
the
floor
another
with
pens
and
ornamental
ink
stand
stood
by
the
wall
and
over
this
last
was
a
collection
of
books
ranged
upon
shelves
of
red
a
handsome
clock
adorned
the
mantelpiece
and
in
the
open
fireplace
was
a
pair
of
small
andirons
with
silver
knobs
cast
after
a
fanciful
device
and
richly
chased
of
course
there
was
no
fire
at
that
season
of
the
year
even
the
heat
caused
by
the
mosquito
bar
would
have
been
annoying
but
that
the
large
on
one
side
and
the
window
on
the
other
both
standing
open
gave
passage
to
the
breeze
that
penetrated
through
the
nettings
of
my
couch
along
with
this
breeze
came
the
most
delicious
fragrance
the
essence
of
flowers
through
both
door
and
window
i
could
see
their
thousand
clustering
corollas
roses
red
pink
and
white
the
rare
camelia
azaleas
and
jessamines
the
and
farther
off
a
little
i
could
distinguish
the
waxen
leaves
and
huge
blossoms
of
the
great
american
laurel
the
i
could
hear
the
voices
of
many
and
a
low
monotonous
hum
that
i
supposed
to
be
the
noise
of
falling
water
these
were
the
only
sounds
that
reached
my
ears
was
i
alone
i
looked
inquiringly
around
the
chamber
it
appeared
so
no
living
thing
met
my
glance
i
was
struck
with
a
peculiarity
in
the
apartment
i
occupied
it
appeared
to
stand
by
itself
and
did
not
communicate
with
any
other
the
only
door
i
could
see
opened
directly
to
the
outside
so
did
the
window
reaching
to
the
ground
both
appeared
to
lead
into
a
garden
filled
with
shrubs
and
flowers
excepting
the
chimney
i
could
perceive
no
other
inlet
or
outlet
to
the
apartment
this
at
first
seemed
odd
but
a
moment
reflection
explained
it
it
is
not
uncommon
upon
american
plantations
to
have
a
kind
of
office
or
apart
from
the
main
building
and
often
fitted
up
in
a
style
of
comfort
and
luxuriance
this
becomes
upon
occasions
the
stranger
room
perhaps
i
was
in
such
an
apartment
at
all
events
i
was
under
an
hospitable
roof
and
in
good
hands
that
was
evident
the
manner
in
which
i
was
encouched
along
with
certain
preparations
the
signs
of
a
projected
that
appeared
upon
the
table
attested
this
but
who
was
my
host
or
was
it
a
hostess
was
it
eugenie
besancon
did
she
not
say
something
of
her
house
or
did
i
only
dream
it
i
lay
guessing
and
reflecting
over
a
mass
of
confused
memories
but
i
could
not
from
these
arrive
at
any
knowledge
of
whose
guest
i
was
nevertheless
i
had
a
sort
of
belief
that
i
was
in
the
house
of
my
last
night
companion
i
became
anxious
and
in
my
weakness
perhaps
felt
a
little
vexed
at
being
left
alone
i
would
have
rung
but
no
bell
was
within
reach
at
that
moment
however
i
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
romantic
miss
you
will
fancy
that
those
footsteps
were
light
and
soft
made
by
a
small
satin
slipper
scarcely
discomposing
the
loosest
tiniest
pebble
stealthily
drawing
near
lest
their
sound
might
awake
the
sleeping
invalid
and
then
in
the
midst
of
and
humming
waters
and
the
sweet
perfume
of
flowers
a
fair
form
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
i
saw
a
gentle
face
with
a
pair
of
soft
lovely
eyes
in
a
timid
inquiring
glance
gazing
upon
me
you
will
fancy
all
this
no
doubt
but
your
fancy
is
entirely
at
fault
and
not
at
all
like
the
reality
the
footsteps
i
heard
were
made
by
a
pair
of
thick
brogans
of
alligator
leather
and
full
thirteen
inches
in
length
which
brogans
the
next
moment
rested
upon
the
sill
of
the
door
directly
before
my
eyes
on
raising
my
glance
a
little
higher
i
perceived
a
pair
of
legs
in
wide
jeans
pantaloons
and
carrying
my
eye
still
higher
i
perceived
a
broad
heavy
chest
covered
with
a
striped
cotton
shirt
a
pair
of
massive
arms
and
huge
shoulders
surmounted
by
the
shining
face
and
woolly
head
of
a
jet
black
negro
the
face
and
head
came
under
my
observation
last
but
on
these
my
eyes
dwelt
longest
scanning
them
over
and
over
until
i
at
length
despite
the
pain
i
was
suffering
burst
out
into
a
sonorous
laugh
if
i
had
been
dying
i
could
not
have
helped
it
there
was
something
so
comic
so
irresistibly
ludicrous
in
the
physiognomy
of
this
sable
intruder
he
was
a
and
rather
large
negro
as
black
as
charcoal
with
a
splendid
tier
of
ivories
and
with
eyeballs
pupil
and
irides
excepted
as
white
as
his
teeth
but
it
was
not
these
that
had
tickled
my
fancy
it
was
the
peculiar
contour
of
his
head
and
the
set
and
size
of
his
ears
the
former
was
as
round
as
a
globe
and
thickly
covered
with
small
kinky
curlets
of
black
wool
so
closely
set
that
they
seemed
to
root
at
both
ends
and
form
a
nap
from
the
sides
of
this
sable
sphere
stood
out
a
pair
of
enormous
ears
suggesting
the
idea
of
wings
and
giving
to
the
head
a
singularly
ludicrous
appearance
it
was
this
peculiarity
that
had
set
me
laughing
and
indecorous
though
it
was
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
it
my
visitor
however
did
not
seem
to
take
it
amiss
on
the
contrary
he
at
once
opened
his
thick
lips
and
displaying
the
splendid
armature
of
his
mouth
in
a
broad
and
grin
began
laughing
as
loudly
as
myself
was
he
his
ears
had
infused
nothing
of
the
vampire
into
his
character
no
the
very
type
of
jollity
and
fun
was
the
broad
black
face
of
scipio
besancon
for
such
was
the
cognomen
of
my
visitor
chapter

the
finishing
exclamation
was
one
of
those
thoracic
efforts
peculiar
to
the
american
negro
and
bearing
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
snort
of
a
hippopotamus
its
utterance
signified
that
my
companion
had
finished
his
sentence
and
waited
for

to
speak

who

and
daat
ole
fox
gayarre
he
no
good
here
the
speaker
suddenly
interrupted
himself
as
if
he
feared
that
his
tongue
was
going
too
freely
the
name
he
had
pronounced
and
the
expression
by
which
it
was
qualified
at
once
awakened
my
curiosity
the
name
more
than
the
qualification
if
it
be
the
same
thought
i
scipio
has
characterised
him
not
otherwise
than
justly
can
it
be
the
same
you
mean
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
the
i
asked
after
a
pause
scipio
great
white
eyeballs
rolled
about
with
an
expression
of
mingled
surprise
and
apprehension
and
rather
stammeringly
he
replied
daat
am
de
name
know
young
only
very
slightly
i
answered
and
this
answer
seemed
to
set
my
companion
at
his
ease
again
the
truth
is
i
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
individual
mentioned
but
during
my
stay
in
new
orleans
accident
had
brought
me
in
contact
with
the
name
a
little
adventure
had
befallen
me
in
which
the
bearer
of
it
figured
not
to
advantage
on
the
contrary
i
had
conceived
a
strong
dislike
for
the
man
who
as
already
stated
was
a
lawyer
or
of
the
new
orleans
bar
scipio
man
was
no
doubt
the
same
the
name
was
too
rare
a
one
to
be
borne
by
two
individuals
besides
i
had
heard
that
he
was
owner
of
a
plantation
somewhere
up
the
coast
at
bringiers
i
remembered
the
probabilities
were
it
was
he
if
so
and
mademoiselle
besancon
had
no
other
friend
then
indeed
had
scipio
spoken
truly
when
he
said
she
hab
no
friends
leff
scipio
observation
had
not
only
roused
my
curiosity
but
had
imparted
to
me
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
was
now
deeply
interested
in
this
young
creole
a
man
who
has
saved
a
life
the
life
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
could
not
well
be
indifferent
to
the
of
her
he
has
rescued
was
it
a
lover
interest
that
had
been
awakened
within
me
my
heart
answered
no
to
my
own
astonishment
it
gave
this
answer
on
the
boat
i
had
fancied
myself
half
in
love
with
this
young
lady
and
now
after
a
romantic
incident
one
that
might
appear
a
very
provocative
to
the
sublime
passion
i
lay
on
my
couch
contemplating
the
whole
affair
with
a
coolness
that
surprised
even
myself
i
felt
that
i
had
lost
much
blood
had
my
incipient
passion
flowed
out
of
my
veins
at
the
same
time
i
endeavoured
to
find
some
explanation
for
this
rare
psychological
fact
but
at
that
time
i
was
but
an
indifferent
student
of
the
mind
the
land
of
love
was
to
me
a
one
thing
was
odd
enough
whenever
i
essayed
to
recall
the
features
of
the
creole
the
rose
up
before
me
more
palpable
than
ever
strange
thought
i
this
lovely
vision
this
dream
of
my
diseased
brain
oh
what
would
i
not
give
to
embody
this
fair
spectral
form
i
had
no
longer
a
doubt
about
it
i
was
certain
i
did
not
love
mademoiselle
besancon
and
yet
i
was
far
from
feeling
indifferent
towards
her
friendship
was
the
feeling
that
now
actuated
me
the
interest
i
felt
for
her
was
that
of
a
friend
strong
enough
was
it
to
render
me
anxious
on
her
account
to
make
me
desirous
of
knowing
more
both
of
herself
and
her
affairs
scipio
was
not
of
secretive
habit
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
was
the
confidant
of
all
he
knew
eugenie
besancon
was
the
daughter
and
only
child
of
a
creole
planter
who
had
died
some
two
years
before
as
some
thought
wealthy
while
others
believed
that
his
affairs
were
embarrassed
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
had
been
left
of
the
estate
with
the
steward
antoine
both
being
guardiums
sic
scipio
of
the
young
lady
gayarre
had
been
the
lawyer
of
besancon
and
antoine
his
faithful
servitor
hence
the
trust
reposed
in
the
old
steward
who
in
latter
years
stood
in
the
relation
of
friend
and
companion
rather
than
of
servant
to
besancon
himself
in
a
few
months
mademoiselle
would
be
of
age
but
whether
her
inheritance
was
large
scipio
could
not
tell
he
only
knew
that
since
her
father
death
monsieur
dominique
the
principal
executor
had
furnished
her
with
ample
funds
whenever
called
upon
that
she
had
not
been
restricted
in
any
way
that
she
was
generous
that
she
was
profuse
in
her
expenditure
or
as
scipio
described
it
berry
wasteful
an
flung
about
de
shinin
dollars
as
ef
dey
war
the
black
gave
some
glowing
details
of
many
a
grand
ball
and
that
had
taken
place
on
the
plantation
and
hinted
at
the
expensive
life
which
young
missa
led
while
in
the
city
where
she
usually
resided
during
most
part
of
the
winter
all
this
i
could
easily
credit
from
what
had
occurred
on
the
boat
and
other
circumstances
i
was
impressed
with
the
belief
that
eugenie
besancon
was
just
the
person
to
answer
to
the
description
of
scipio
ardent
of
soul
full
of
warm
impulses
generous
to
a
fault
reckless
in
expenditure
living
altogether
in
the
present
and
not
caring
to
make
any
calculation
for
the
future
just
such
an
heiress
as
would
exactly
suit
the
purposes
of
an
unprincipled
administrator
i
could
see
that
poor
scipio
had
a
great
regard
for
his
young
mistress
but
even
ignorant
as
he
was
he
had
some
suspicion
that
all
this
profuse
outlay
boded
no
good
he
shook
his
head
as
he
talked
of
these
matters
adding
afeerd
young
it
nebber
nebber
last
de
bank
hisseff
would
be
broke
by
such
a
constant
drawin
ob
money
when
scipio
came
to
speak
of
gayarre
he
shook
his
head
still
more
significantly
he
had
evidently
some
strange
suspicions
about
this
individual
though
he
was
unwilling
just
then
to
declare
them
i
learnt
enough
to
identify
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
with
my
of
the
rue
new
orleans
no
doubt
remained
on
my
mind
that
it
was
the
same
a
lawyer
by
profession
but
more
of
a
speculator
in
stocks
a
in
other
words
usurer
in
the
country
a
planter
owning
the
plantation
adjoining
that
of
besancon
with
more
than
a
hundred
slaves
whom
he
treats
with
the
utmost
severity
all
this
is
in
correspondence
with
the
calling
and
character
of
my
monsieur
dominique
they
are
the
same
scipio
gives
me
some
additional
details
of
him
he
was
the
law
adviser
and
the
companion
of
monsieur
besancon
scipio
says
too
often
for
ole
good
and
believes
that
the
latter
suffered
much
from
his
acquaintance
or
as
scipio
phrases
it
gayarre
humbug
ole
he
cheat
many
an
many
a
time
certain
furthermore
i
learn
from
my
attendant
that
gayarre
resides
upon
his
plantation
during
the
summer
months
that
he
is
a
daily
visitor
at
the
big
house
the
residence
of
mademoiselle
besancon
where
he
makes
himself
quite
at
home
acting
says
scipio
as
ef
de
place
to
him
and
he
war
de
boss
ob
de
plantation
i
fancied
scipio
knew
something
more
about
this
man
some
definite
matter
that
he
did
not
like
to
talk
about
it
was
natural
enough
considering
our
recent
acquaintance
i
could
see
that
he
had
a
strong
dislike
towards
gayarre
did
he
found
it
on
some
actual
knowledge
of
the
latter
or
was
it
instinct
a
principle
strongly
developed
in
these
poor
slaves
who
are
not
permitted
to
his
information
however
comprised
too
many
facts
to
be
the
product
of
mere
instinct
it
savoured
of
actual
knowledge
he
must
have
learnt
these
things
from
some
quarter
where
could
he
have
gathered
them
who
told
you
all
this
scipio
aurore
aurore
chapter
sixteen
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
i
felt
a
sudden
desire
amounting
almost
to
anxiety
to
learn
who
was
aurore
why
was
it
the
singularity
and
beauty
of
the
name
for
novel
and
beautiful
it
sounded
in
my
saxon
ears
no
was
it
the
mere
euphony
of
the
word
its
mythic
associations
its
less
ideal
application
to
the
rosy
hours
of
the
orient
or
the
shining
phosphorescence
of
the
north
was
it
any
of
these
associate
thoughts
that
awoke
within
me
this
mysterious
interest
in
the
name
aurore
i
was
not
allowed
time
to
reflect
or
question
scipio
farther
at
that
moment
the
door
was
darkened
by
the
entrance
of
two
men
who
without
saying
a
word
stepped
inside
the
apartment
da
doctor
whispered
scipio
falling
back
and
permitting
the
gentlemen
to
approach
of
the
two
it
was
not
difficult
to
tell
which
was
the
doctor
the
professional
face
was
unmistakeable
and
i
knew
that
the
tall
pale
man
who
regarded
me
with
interrogative
glance
was
a
disciple
of
esculapius
as
certainly
as
if
he
had
carried
his
diploma
in
one
hand
and
his
in
the
other
he
was
a
man
of
forty
not
though
the
face
was
not
one
that
would
be
termed
handsome
it
was
however
interesting
from
a
quiet
intellectuality
that
characterised
it
as
well
as
an
habitual
expression
of
kind
feeling
it
had
been
a
german
face
some
two
or
three
generations
before
but
an
american
climate
political
i
mean
had
tamed
down
the
rude
lines
produced
by
ages
of
european
despotism
and
had
almost
restored
it
to
its
primitive
nobility
of
feature
afterwards
when
better
acquainted
with
american
types
i
should
have
known
it
as
a
pennsylvanian
face
and
such
in
reality
it
was
i
saw
before
me
a
graduate
of
one
of
the
great
medical
schools
of
philadelphia
dr
edward
reigart
the
name
confirmed
my
suspicion
of
german
origin
altogether
my
medical
attendant
made
a
pleasing
impression
upon
me
at
first
sight
how
different
was
that
i
received
on
glancing
toward
his
companion
antagonism
hatred
contempt
disgust
a
face
purely
french
not
that
noble
french
face
we
see
in
the
duguesclins
the
jean
barts
and
among
many
of
the
old
huguenot
heroes
and
in
modern
days
in
a
rollin
a
hugo
an
arago
or
a
pyat
but
such
an
one
as
you
may
see
any
day
by
hundreds
sneaking
around
the
bourse
or
the
of
the
opera
or
in
thousands
scowling
from
under
a
shako
in
the
ranks
of
a
ruffian
soldiery
a
countenance
that
i
can
not
describe
better
than
by
saying
that
its
features
forcibly
reminded
me
of
those
of
a
fox
i
am
not
in
jest
i
observed
this
resemblance
plainly
i
observed
the
same
obliquity
of
eyes
the
same
sharp
quick
glance
that
betokened
the
presence
of
deep
dissimulation
of
utter
selfishness
of
cruel
inhumanity
in
the
doctor
companion
i
beheld
a
type
of
this
face
the
fox
in
human
form
and
with
all
the
attributes
of
this
animal
highly
developed
my
instincts
chimed
with
scipio
for
i
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
before
me
stood
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
it
was
he
a
man
of
small
stature
he
was
and
thinly
built
but
evidently
one
who
could
endure
a
great
deal
before
parting
with
life
he
had
all
the
subtle
wiry
look
of
the
as
well
as
their
disposition
the
eyes
as
already
observed
obliqued
strongly
downwards
the
balls
were
not
but
rather
obtuse
cones
of
which
the
pupil
was
the
apex
both
pupils
and
irides
were
black
and
glistened
like
the
eyes
of
a
weasel
they
seemed
to
sparkle
in
a
sort
of
habitual
smile
but
this
smile
was
purely
cynical
and
deceptive
if
any
one
knew
themselves
guilty
of
a
weakness
or
a
crime
they
felt
certain
that
dominique
gayarre
knew
it
and
it
was
at
this
he
was
laughing
when
a
case
of
misfortune
did
really
present
itself
to
his
knowledge
his
smile
became
more
intensely
satirical
and
his
small
prominent
eyes
sparkled
with
evident
delight
he
was
a
lover
of
himself
and
a
hater
of
his
kind
for
the
rest
he
had
black
hair
thin
and
limp
shaggy
dark
brows
set
obliquely
face
without
beard
of
pale
cadaverous
hue
and
surmounted
by
a
nose
of
large
dimensions
his
dress
had
somewhat
of
a
professional
cut
and
consisted
of
dark
broadcloth
with
vest
of
black
satin
and
around
his
neck
instead
of
cravat
he
wore
a
broad
black
ribbon
in
age
he
looked
fifty
the
doctor
felt
my
pulse
asked
me
how
i
had
slept
looked
at
my
tongue
felt
my
pulse
a
second
time
and
then
in
a
kindly
way
desired
me
to
keep
myself
as
quiet
as
possible
as
an
inducement
to
do
so
he
told
me
i
was
still
very
weak
that
i
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
blood
but
hoped
that
a
few
days
would
restore
me
to
my
strength
scipio
was
charged
with
my
diet
and
was
ordered
to
prepare
tea
toast
and
broiled
chicken
for
my
breakfast
the
doctor
did
not
inquire
how
i
came
by
my
wound
this
i
thought
somewhat
strange
but
ascribed
it
to
his
desire
that
i
should
remain
quiet
he
fancied
no
doubt
that
any
allusion
to
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
night
might
cause
me
unnecessary
excitement
i
was
too
anxious
about
antoine
to
remain
silent
and
inquired
the
news
nothing
more
had
been
heard
of
him
he
was
certainly
lost
i
recounted
the
circumstances
under
which
i
had
parted
with
him
and
of
course
described
my
encounter
with
the
bully
and
how
i
had
received
the
wound
i
could
not
help
remarking
a
strange
expression
that
marked
the
features
of
gayarre
as
i
spoke
he
was
all
attention
and
when
i
told
of
the
raft
of
chairs
and
expressed
my
conviction
that
they
would
not
support
the
steward
a
single
moment
i
fancied
i
saw
the
dark
eyes
of
the
flashing
with
delight
there
certainly
was
an
expression
in
them
of
satisfaction
that
was
hideous
to
behold
i
might
not
have
noticed
this
or
at
all
events
not
have
understood
it
but
for
what
scipio
had
already
told
me
now
its
meaning
was
unmistakeable
and
notwithstanding
the
poor
monsieur
antoine
to
which
the
hypocrite
repeatedly
gave
utterance
i
saw
plainly
that
he
was
secretly
delighted
at
the
idea
of
the
old
steward
having
gone
to
the
bottom
when
i
had
finished
my
narrative
gayarre
drew
the
doctor
aside
and
the
two
conversed
for
some
moments
in
a
low
tone
i
could
hear
part
of
what
passed
between
them
the
doctor
seemed
not
to
care
whether
i
overheard
him
while
the
other
appeared
equally
anxious
that
their
conversation
should
not
reach
me
from
the
replies
of
the
doctor
i
could
make
out
that
the
wily
lawyer
wished
to
have
me
removed
from
my
present
quarters
and
taken
to
an
hotel
in
the
village
he
urged
the
peculiar
position
in
which
the
young
lady
mademoiselle
besancon
would
be
placed
alone
in
her
house
with
a
stranger
a
young
man
etcetera
etcetera
the
doctor
did
not
see
the
necessity
of
my
removal
on
such
grounds
the
lady
herself
did
not
wish
it
in
fact
would
not
hear
of
it
he
the
peculiarity
of
the
situation
good
doctor
reigart
the
accommodation
of
the
hotel
was
none
of
the
best
besides
it
was
already
crowded
with
other
sufferers
and
here
the
speaker
voice
sank
so
low
i
could
only

reply
to
this
last
objection
was
that
would
be

for
my

bill
this
was
intentionally
spoken
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
it
and
i
should
have
felt
grateful
for
such
an
offer
had
i
not
suspected
some
sinister
motive
for
the
lawyer
generosity
the
doctor
met
the
proposal
with
still
further
objections

on

risk
would

or

when
stronger
the
promise
of
my
removal
in
a
day
or
two
appeared
to
satisfy
the
weasel
gayarre
or
rather
he
became
satisfied
that
such
was
the
only
course
that
could
be
taken
with
me
and
the
consultation
ended
gayarre
now
approached
the
bed
to
take
leave
and
i
could
trace
that
ironical
expression
playing
in
the
pupils
of
his
little
eyes
as
he
pronounced
some
pretended
phrases
of
consolation
he
little
knew
to
whom
he
was
speaking
had
i
uttered
my
name
it
would
perhaps
have
brought
the
colour
to
his
pale
cheek
and
caused
him
to
make
an
abrupt
exit
prudence
prevented
me
from
declaring
it
and
when
the
doctor
requested
to
know
upon
whom
he
had
the
honour
of
attending
i
adopted
the
pardonable
strategy
in
use
among
distinguished
travellers
of
giving
a
du
i
assumed
my
maternal
patronymic
of
rutherford
edward
rutherford
recommending
me
to
keep
myself
quiet
not
to
attempt
leaving
my
bed
to
take
certain
prescriptions
at
certain
hours
etcetera
etcetera
the
doctor
took
his
leave
gayarre
having
already
gone
out
before
him
chapter
seventeen
aurore
i
was
for
the
moment
alone
scipio
having
betaken
himself
to
the
kitchen
in
search
of
the
tea
toast
and
chicken
fixings
i
lay
reflecting
upon
the
interview
just
ended
and
especially
upon
the
conversation
between
the
doctor
and
gayarre
in
which
had
occurred
several
points
that
suggested
singular
ideas
the
conduct
of
the
doctor
was
natural
enough
indeed
betokened
the
true
gentleman
but
for
the
other
there
was
a
sinister
design
i
could
not
doubt
it
why
the
desire
an
anxiety
in
fact
to
have
me
removed
to
the
hotel
evidently
there
was
some
strong
motive
since
he
proposed
to
pay
the
expenses
for
from
my
slight
knowledge
of
the
man
i
knew
him
to
be
the
very
opposite
to
generous
what
can
be
his
motive
for
my
removal
i
asked
myself
ha
i
have
it
i
have
the
explanation
i
see
through
his
designs
clearly
this
fox
this
cunning
this
guardian
is
no
doubt
in
love
with
his
own
ward
she
is
young
rich
beautiful
a
belle
and
he
old
ugly
mean
and
contemptible
but
what
of
that
he
does
not
think
himself
either
one
or
the
other
and
she
bah
he
may
even
hope
far
less
reasonable
hopes
have
been
crowned
with
success
he
knows
the
world
he
is
a
lawyer
he
knows
at
least
her
world
he
is
her
solicitor
holds
her
affairs
entirely
in
his
hands
he
is
guardian
executor
agent
all
has
perfect
and
complete
control
with
such
advantages
what
can
he
not
effect
all
that
he
may
desire
her
marriage
or
her
ruin
poor
lady
i
pity
her
strange
to
say
it
was
only
that
it
was
not
another
feeling
was
a
mystery
i
could
not
comprehend
the
entrance
of
scipio
interrupted
my
reflections
a
young
girl
assisted
him
with
the
plates
and
dishes
this
was
chloe
his
daughter
a
child
of
thirteen
or
thereabouts
but
not
black
like
the
father
she
was
a
yellow
girl
with
rather
handsome
features
scipio
explained
this
the
mother
of
his
leettle
chlo
as
he
called
her
was
a
mulatta
and
hab
taken
arter
de
ole
hya
hya
the
tone
of
scipio
laugh
showed
that
he
was
more
than
satisfied
proud
in
fact
of
being
the
father
of
so
and
pretty
a
little
creature
as
chloe
chloe
like
all
her
kind
was
brimful
of
curiosity
and
in
rolling
about
the
whites
of
her
eyes
to
get
a
peep
at
the
buckra
stranger
who
had
saved
her
mistress
life
she
came
near
breaking
cups
plates
and
dishes
for
which
negligence
scipio
would
have
boxed
her
ears
but
for
my
intercession
the
odd
expressions
and
gestures
the
novel
behaviour
of
both
father
and
daughter
the
peculiarity
of
this
interested
me
i
had
a
keen
appetite
notwithstanding
my
weakness
i
had
eaten
nothing
on
the
boat
in
the
excitement
of
the
race
supper
had
been
forgotten
by
most
of
the
passengers
myself
among
the
number
scipio
preparations
now
put
my
palate
in
tune
and
i
did
ample
justice
to
the
skill
of
chloe
mother
who
as
scipio
informed
me
was
de
boss
in
de
kitchen
the
tea
strengthened
me
the
chicken
delicately
fricasseed
and
garnished
upon
rice
seemed
to
refill
my
veins
with
fresh
blood
with
the
exception
of
the
slight
pain
of
my
wound
i
already
felt
quite
restored
my
attendants
removed
the
breakfast
things
and
after
a
while
scipio
returned
to
remain
in
the
room
with
me
for
such
were
his
orders
and
now
scipio
i
said
as
soon
as
we
were
alone

could
you

scipio
it
was
not
idle
curiosity
that
prompted
me
to
put
this
question
a
stronger
motive
impelled
me
the
still
haunted
me
those
features
of
strange
type
its
expression
not
caucasian
not
indian
not
asiatic
was
it
possible
probable
could
you
describe
her
scipio
i
repeated
her
daat
what
you
mean
ye
yes
i
had
no
hope
of
a
very
lucid
painting
but
perhaps
a
few
points
would
serve
to
identify
the
likeness
of
my
vision
in
my
mind
the
portrait
was
as
plainly
drawn
as
if
the
real
face
were
before
my
eyes
i
should
easily
tell
if
aurore
and
my
dream
were
one
i
began
to
think
it
was
no
dream
but
a
reality
well
some
folks
says
she
am
proud
case
de
common
niggers
envy
ob
her
daat
de

she

proud
to

read
and
de
ole
chloe
and
de
leettle
chloe
an
she
it
is
a
description
of
her
person
i
ask
for
scipio
oh
a
ob
her
person
ye
daat
is
what
am
she
like
so
what
sort
of
hair
for
instance
what
colour
is
it
brack
brack
as
a
boot
is
it
straight
hair
no
ob
course
not
aurore
am
a
quaderoom
it
curls
well
not
dzactly
like
this
hyar
here
scipio
pointed
to
his
own
kinky
but
for
all
daat
it
curls
what
folks
call
de
wave
i
understand
it
falls
down
to
her
shoulders
daat
it
do
down
to
de
berry
small
ob
her
back
luxuriant
what
am
dat
thick
bushy
golly
it
am
as
bushy
as
de
ole
coon
tail
now
the
eyes
scipio
description
of
the
quadroon
eyes
was
rather
a
confused
one
he
was
happy
in
a
simile
however
which
i
felt
satisfied
with
dey
am
big
an
round
dey
shine
like
de
eyes
of
a
deer
the
nose
puzzled
him
but
after
some
elaborate
questioning
i
could
make
out
that
it
was
straight
and
small
the
eyebrows
the
teeth
the
complexion
were
all
faithfully
pictured
that
of
the
cheeks
by
a
simile
like
de
red
ob
a
georgium
peach
comic
as
was
the
description
given
i
had
no
inclination
to
be
amused
with
it
i
was
too
much
interested
in
the
result
and
listened
to
every
detail
with
an
anxiety
i
could
not
account
for
the
portrait
was
finished
at
length
and
i
felt
certain
it
must
be
that
of
the
lovely
apparition
when
scipio
had
ended
speaking
i
lay
upon
my
couch
burning
with
an
intense
desire
to
see
this
fair
this
priceless
quadroon
just
then
a
bell
rang
from
the
house
scipio
wanted
daat
him
bell
be
back
in
a
minute
so
saying
the
negro
left
me
and
ran
towards
the
house
i
lay
reflecting
on
the
singular
somewhat
romantic
situation
in
which
circumstances
had
suddenly
placed
me
but
yesterday
but
the
night
before
a
traveller
without
a
dollar
in
my
purse
and
not
knowing
what
roof
would
next
shelter
me
the
guest
of
a
lady
young
rich
unmarried
the
invalid
guest
laid
up
for
an
indefinite
period
well
cared
for
and
well
attended
these
thoughts
soon
gave
way
to
others
the
drove
them
out
of
my
mind
and
i
found
myself
comparing
it
with
scipio
picture
of
the
quadroon
the
more
i
did
so
the
more
i
was
struck
with
their
correspondence
how
could
i
have
dreamt
a
thing
so
palpable
scarce
probable
surely
i
must
have
seen
it
why
not
forms
and
faces
were
around
me
when
i
fainted
and
was
carried
in
why
not
hers
among
the
rest
this
was
indeed
probable
and
would
explain
all
but
was
she
among
them
i
should
ask
scipio
on
his
return
the
long
conversation
i
had
held
with
my
attendant
had
wearied
me
weak
and
exhausted
as
i
was
the
bright
sun
shining
across
my
chamber
did
not
prevent
me
from
feeling
drowsy
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
sank
back
upon
my
pillow
and
fell
asleep
chapter
eighteen
the
creole
and
quadroon
i
slept
for
perhaps
an
hour
soundly
then
something
awoke
me
and
i
lay
for
some
moments
only
half
sensible
to
outward
impressions
pleasant
impressions
they
were
sweet
perfumes
floated
around
me
and
i
could
distinguish
a
soft
silky
rustling
such
as
betokens
the
presence
of
women
he
wakes
half
whispered
a
sweet
voice
my
eyes
now
open
rested
upon
the
speaker
for
some
moments
i
thought
it
was
but
the
continuation
of
my
dream
there
was
the
the
black
profuse
hair
the
brilliant
orbs
the
arching
brows
the
small
curving
lips
the
damask
cheek
all
before
me
is
it
a
dream
no
she
breathes
she
moves
she
speaks
see
he
looks
at
us
surely
he
is
awake
it
is
no
dream
then
no
vision
it
is
she
it
is
aurore
up
to
this
moment
i
was
still
but
half
conscious
the
thought
had
passed
from
my
lips
but
perhaps
only
the
last
phrase
was
uttered
loud
enough
to
be
heard
an
ejaculation
that
followed
fully
awoke
me
and
i
now
saw
two
female
forms
close
by
the
side
of
my
couch
they
stood
regarding
each
other
with
looks
of
surprise
one
was
eugenie
beyond
doubt
the
other
was
aurore
your
name
said
the
astonished
mistress
my
name
repeated
the
equally
astonished
slave
but
how
he
knows
your
name
how
i
can
not
tell
have
you
been
here
before
no
not
till
this
moment
is
very
strange
said
the
young
lady
turning
towards
me
with
an
inquiring
glance
i
was
now
awake
and
in
full
possession
of
my
senses
enough
to
perceive
that
i
had
been
talking
too
loud
my
knowledge
of
the
quadroon
name
would
require
an
explanation
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
knew
not
what
to
say
to
tell
what
i
had
been
thinking
to
account
for
the
expressions
i
had
uttered
would
have
placed
me
in
a
very
absurd
position
and
yet
to
maintain
silence
might
leave
besancon
busy
with
some
strange
thoughts
something
must
be
said
a
little
deceit
was
absolutely
necessary
in
hopes
she
would
speak
first
and
perchance
give
me
a
key
to
what
i
should
say
i
remained
for
some
moments
without
opening
my
lips
i
pretended
to
feel
pain
from
my
wound
and
turned
uneasily
on
the
bed
she
seemed
not
to
notice
this
but
remained
in
her
attitude
of
surprise
simply
repeating
the
words
is
very
strange
he
should
know
your
name
my
imprudent
speech
had
made
an
impression
i
could
remain
silent
no
longer
and
turning
my
face
once
more
i
pretended
now
for
the
first
time
to
be
aware
of
mademoiselle
presence
at
the
same
time
offering
my
congratulations
and
expressing
my
joy
at
seeing
her
after
one
or
two
anxious
inquiries
in
relation
to
my
wound
she
asked
but
how
came
you
to
name
aurore
aurore
i
replied
oh
you
think
it
strange
that
i
should
know
her
name
thanks
to
scipio
faithful
portraiture
i
knew
at
the
first
glance
that
this
was
aurore
i
pointed
to
the
quadroon
who
had
retired
a
pace
or
two
and
stood
silent
and
evidently
astonished
oh
scipio
has
been
speaking
of
her
yes
he
and
i
have
had
a
busy
morning
of
it
i
have
drawn
largely
on
scipio
knowledge
of
plantation
affairs
i
am
already
acquainted
with
aunt
chloe
and
little
chloe
and
a
whole
host
of
your
people
these
things
interest
me
who
am
strange
to
your
louisiana
life
monsieur
replied
the
lady
seemingly
satisfied
with
my
explanation
i
am
glad
you
are
so
well
the
doctor
has
given
me
the
assurance
you
will
soon
recover
noble
stranger
i
have
heard
how
you
received
your
wound
for
me
it
was
in
my
defence
oh
how
shall
i
ever
repay
you
how
thank
you
for
my
life
no
thanks
are
necessary
it
was
the
fulfilment
of
a
simple
duty
on
my
part
i
ran
no
great
risk
in
saving
you
no
risk
monsieur
every
risk
from
the
knife
of
an
assassin
from
the
waves
no
risk
but
monsieur
i
can
assure
you
my
gratitude
shall
be
in
proportion
to
your
generous
gallantry
my
heart
tells
me
so
alas
poor
heart
it
is
filled
at
once
with
gratitude
and
grief
yes
i
understand
you
have
much
to
lament
in
the
loss
of
a
faithful
servant
faithful
servant
monsieur
say
rather
friend
faithful
indeed
since
my
poor
father
death
he
has
been
my
father
all
my
cares
were
his
all
my
affairs
in
his
hands
i
knew
not
trouble
but
now
alas
i
know
not
what
is
before
me
suddenly
changing
her
manner
she
eagerly
inquired
when
you
last
saw
him
monsieur
you
say
he
was
struggling
with
the
ruffian
who
wounded
you
he
it
was
the
last
i
saw
of
either
there
is
no
hope
none
the
boat
went
down
a
few
moments
after
poor
antoine
poor
antoine
again
she
burst
into
tears
for
she
had
evidently
been
weeping
before
i
could
offer
no
consolation
i
did
not
attempt
it
it
was
better
she
should
weep
tears
alone
could
relieve
her
the
coachman
pierre
too
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
my
people
he
too
is
lost
i
grieve
for
him
as
well
but
antoine
was
my
friend
he
was
mine
oh
the
loss
the
loss
friendless
and
yet
perhaps
i
soon
need
friends
pauvre
she
wept
as
she
uttered
these
phrases
aurore
was
also
in
tears
i
could
not
restrain
myself
the
eyes
of
childhood
returned
and
i
too
wept
this
solemn
scene
was
at
length
brought
to
a
termination
by
eugenie
who
appearing
suddenly
to
gain
the
mastery
over
her
grief
approached
the
bedside
monsieur
said
she
i
fear
for
some
time
you
will
find
in
me
a
sad
host
i
can
not
easily
forget
my
friend
but
i
know
you
will
pardon
me
for
thus
indulging
in
a
moment
of
sorrow
for
the
present
adieu
i
shall
return
soon
and
see
that
you
are
properly
waited
upon
i
have
lodged
you
in
this
little
place
that
you
might
be
out
of
reach
of
noises
that
would
disturb
you
indeed
i
am
to
blame
for
this
present
intrusion
the
doctor
has
ordered
you
not
to
be
visited
but
i
i
could
not
rest
till
i
had
seen
the
preserver
of
my
life
and
offered
him
my
thanks
adieu
adieu
come
aurore
i
was
left
alone
and
lay
reflecting
upon
the
interview
it
had
impressed
me
with
a
profound
feeling
of
friendship
for
eugenie
besancon
more
than
friendship
sympathy
for
i
could
not
resist
the
belief
that
somehow
or
other
she
was
in
peril
that
over
that
young
heart
late
so
light
and
gay
a
cloud
was
gathering
i
felt
for
her
regard
friendship
sympathy
nothing
more
and
why
nothing
more
why
did
i
not
love
her
young
rich
beautiful
why
because
i
loved
another
loved
chapter
nineteen
a
louisian
landscape
life
in
the
chamber
of
an
invalid
who
cares
to
listen
to
its
details
they
can
interest
no
one
scarce
the
invalid
himself
mine
was
a
daily
routine
of
trifling
acts
and
consequent
reflections
a
monotony
broken
however
at
intervals
by
the
presence
of
the
being
i
loved
at
such
moments
i
was
no
longer
my
spirit
escaped
from
its
lassitude
and
the
sick
chamber
for
the
time
seemed
an
elysium
alas
these
scenes
were
but
of
a
few
minutes
duration
while
the
intervals
between
them
were
hours
long
hours
so
long
i
fancied
them
days
twice
every
day
i
was
visited
by
my
fair
host
and
her
companion
neither
ever
came
alone
there
was
constraint
on
my
part
often
bordering
upon
perplexity
my
conversation
was
with
the
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
with
the
latter
i
dare
but
exchange
glances
etiquette
restrained
the
tongue
though
all
the
conventionalities
of
the
world
could
not
hinder
the
eyes
from
speaking
in
their
own
silent
but
expressive
language
even
in
this
there
was
constraint
my
were
given
by
stealth
they
were
guided
by
a
double
dread
on
one
hand
the
fear
that
their
expression
should
not
be
understood
and
reciprocated
by
the
quadroon
on
the
other
that
they
might
be
too
well
understood
by
the
creole
who
would
regard
me
with
scorn
and
contempt
i
never
dreamt
that
they
might
awaken
jealousy
i
thought
not
of
such
a
thing
eugenie
was
sad
grateful
and
friendly
but
in
her
calm
demeanour
and
firm
tone
of
voice
there
was
no
sign
of
love
indeed
the
terrible
shock
occasioned
by
the
tragic
occurrence
appeared
to
have
produced
a
complete
change
in
her
character
the
elasticity
of
her
mind
formerly
a
characteristic
seemed
to
have
quite
forsaken
her
from
a
gay
girl
she
had
all
at
once
become
a
serious
woman
she
was
not
the
less
beautiful
but
her
beauty
impressed
me
only
as
that
of
the
statue
it
failed
to
enter
my
heart
already
filled
with
beauty
of
a
still
rarer
and
more
glowing
kind
the
creole
loved
me
not
and
strange
to
say
the
reflection
instead
of
piquing
my
vanity
rather
gratified
me
how
different
when
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
quadroon
did
love
me
this
was
the
question
for
whose
answer
my
heart
yearned
with
fond
eagerness
she
always
attended
upon
mademoiselle
during
her
visits
but
not
a
word
dare
i
exchange
with
although
my
heart
was
longing
to
yield
up
its
secret
i
even
feared
that
my
burning
glances
might
betray
me
oh
if
mademoiselle
but
knew
of
my
love
she
would
scorn
and
despise
me
what
in
love
with
a
slave
her
slave
i
understood
this
feeling
well
this
black
crime
of
her
nation
what
was
it
to
me
why
should
i
care
for
customs
and
conventionalities
which
i
at
heart
despised
even
outside
the
levelling
influence
of
love
but
under
that
influence
less
did
i
care
to
respect
them
in
the
eyes
of
love
rank
loses
its
fictitious
charm
titles
seem
trivial
things
for
me
beauty
wears
the
crown
so
far
as
regarded
my
feelings
i
would
not
have
cared
a
straw
if
the
whole
world
had
known
of
my
love
not
a
straw
for
its
scorn
but
there
were
other
considerations
the
courtesy
due
to
hospitality
to
friendship
and
there
were
considerations
of
a
less
delicate
but
still
graver
nature
the
promptings
of
the
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
was
most
peculiar
and
i
knew
it
i
knew
that
my
passion
even
if
reciprocated
must
be
secret
and
silent
talk
of
making
love
to
a
young
miss
closely
watched
by
governess
or
guardian
a
ward
in
chancery
an
heiress
of
expectant
thousands
it
is
but
child
play
to
break
through
the
that
surrounds
one
of
such
to
scribble
sonnets
and
scale
walls
is
but
an
easy
task
compared
with
the
bold
effrontery
that
challenges
the
passions
and
prejudices
of
a
people
my
wooing
promised
to
be
anything
but
easy
my
was
likely
to
be
a
rugged
one
notwithstanding
the
monotony
of
confinement
to
my
chamber
the
hours
of
my
convalescence
passed
pleasantly
enough
everything
was
furnished
me
that
could
contribute
to
my
comfort
or
recovery
ices
delicious
drinks
flowers
rare
and
costly
fruits
were
constantly
supplied
to
me
for
my
dishes
i
was
indebted
to
the
skill
of
scipio
helpmate
chloe
and
through
her
i
became
acquainted
with
the
creole
delicacies
of
gumbo
fish
chowder
fricasseed
frogs
hot
waffles
stewed
tomatoes
and
many
other
dainties
of
the
louisiana
from
the
hands
of
scipio
himself
i
did
not
refuse
a
slice
of
roasted
and
went
even
so
far
as
to
taste
a
steak
but
only
once
and
i
regarded
it
as
once
too
often
scipio
however
had
no
scruples
about
eating
this
creature
and
could
demolish
the
greater
part
of
one
at
a
single
sitting
by
degrees
i
became
initiated
into
the
little
habitudes
and
customs
of
life
upon
a
louisiana
plantation
ole
zip
was
my
instructor
as
he
continued
to
be
my
constant
attendant
when
scipio
talk
tired
me
i
had
recourse
to
books
of
which
a
good
stock
mostly
french
authors
filled
the
little
in
my
apartment
i
found
among
them
nearly
every
work
that
related
to
louisiana
a
proof
of
rare
judgment
on
the
part
of
whoever
had
made
the
collection
among
others
i
read
the
graceful
romance
of
chateaubriand
and
the
history
of
du
pratz
in
the
former
i
could
not
help
remarking
that
want
of
which
in
my
opinion
forms
the
great
charm
of
a
novel
and
which
must
ever
be
absent
where
an
author
attempts
the
painting
of
scenes
or
costumes
not
known
to
him
by
actual
observation
with
regard
to
the
historian
he
indulges
largely
in
those
childish
exaggerations
so
characteristic
of
the
writers
of
the
time
this
remark
applies
without
exception
to
all
the
old
writers
on
american
subjects
whether
english
spanish
or
french
the
chroniclers
of
snakes
crocodiles
twenty
yards
long
and
was
big
enough
to
swallow
both
horse
and
rider
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
these
old
authors
gained
credence
for
their
incongruous
stories
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
science
was
not
then
sufficiently
advanced
to
audit
their
accounts
more
than
in
anything
else
was
i
interested
in
the
adventures
and
melancholy
fate
of
la
salle
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
that
american
writers
have
done
so
little
to
illustrate
the
life
of
the
brave
chevalier
surely
the
most
picturesque
passage
in
their
early
history
the
story
and
the
scene
equally
inviting
the
scene
ah
lovely
indeed
with
such
an
exclamation
did
i
hail
it
when
for
the
first
time
i
sat
at
my
window
and
gazed
out
upon
a
louisiana
landscape
the
windows
as
in
all
creole
houses
reached
down
to
the
floor
and
seated
in
my
with
the
sashes
wide
open
with
the
beautiful
french
curtains
thrown
back
i
commanded
an
extended
view
of
the
country
a
gorgeous
picture
it
presented
the
pencil
of
the
painter
could
scarcely
exaggerate
its
vivid
colouring
my
window
faces
westward
and
the
great
river
rolls
its
yellow
flood
before
my
face
its
ripples
glittering
like
gold
on
its
farther
shore
i
can
see
cultivated
fields
where
wave
the
tall
graceful
culms
of
the
easily
distinguished
from
the
of
darker
hue
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
and
nearly
opposite
stands
a
noble
mansion
something
in
the
style
of
an
italian
villa
with
green
venetians
and
verandah
it
is
embowered
in
groves
of
orange
and
whose
frondage
of
yellowish
green
glistens
gaily
in
the
distance
no
mountains
meet
the
view
there
is
not
a
mountain
in
all
louisiana
but
the
tall
dark
wall
of
cypress
rising
against
the
western
rim
of
the
sky
produces
an
effect
very
similar
to
a
mountain
background
on
my
own
side
of
the
river
the
view
is
more
gardenesque
as
it
consists
principally
of
the
enclosed
of
the
plantation
besancon
here
i
study
objects
more
in
detail
and
am
able
to
note
the
species
of
trees
that
form
the
shrubbery
i
observe
the
with
large
white
flowers
somewhat
resembling
the
giant
of
guiana
some
of
these
have
already
disappeared
and
in
their
stead
are
seen
the
scarce
less
ornamental
than
the
flowers
themselves
side
by
side
with
this
queen
almost
rivalling
her
in
beauty
and
fragrance
and
almost
rivalling
her
in
fame
is
a
lovely
exotic
a
native
of
orient
climes
though
here
long
naturalised
its
large
leaves
of
dark
and
lighter
green
for
both
shades
are
observed
on
the
same
tree
its
flowers
hanging
in
axillary
clusters
from
the
extremities
of
the
shoots
its
yellow
fruits
some
of
which
are
already
formed
all
point
out
its
species
it
is
one
of
the
or
the
or
pride
of
china
the
nomenclature
bestowed
upon
this
fine
tree
by
different
nations
indicates
the
estimation
in
which
it
is
held
tree
of
lays
the
poetic
persian
of
whose
land
it
is
a
native
tree
of
paradise
de
echoes
the
spaniard
of
whose
land
it
is
an
exotic
such
are
its
titles
many
other
trees
both
natives
and
exotics
meet
my
gaze
among
the
former
i
behold
the
catalpa
with
its
silvery
bark
and
blossoms
the
osage
orange
with
its
dark
shining
leaves
and
the
red
mulberry
with
thick
shady
foliage
and
long
crimson
fruits
of
exotics
i
note
the
orange
the
lime
the
west
indian
guava
and
the
guava
of
florida
with
its
boxwood
leaves
the
tamarisk
with
its
spreading
minute
foliage
and
splendid
panicles
of
pale
flowers
the
pomegranate
symbol
of
democracy
the
queen
who
carries
her
crown
upon
her
bosom
and
the
legendary
but
flowerless
here
not
supported
against
the
wall
but
rising
as
a
standard
to
the
height
of
thirty
feet
scarcely
exotic
are
the
with
their
spherical
heads
of
sharp
radiating
blades
scarcely
exotic
the
of
varied
forms
for
species
of
both
are
indigenous
to
the
soil
and
both
are
found
among
the
flora
of
a
not
region
the
scene
before
my
window
is
not
one
of
still
life
over
the
shrubbery
i
can
see
the
gates
leading
to
the
mansion
and
outside
of
these
runs
the
levee
road
although
the
foliage
hinders
me
from
a
full
view
of
the
road
itself
i
see
at
intervals
the
people
passing
along
it
in
the
dress
of
the
creoles
the
colour
predominates
and
the
hats
are
usually
palmetto
or
grass
or
the
costlier
panama
with
broad
brims
now
and
then
a
negro
gallops
past
turbaned
like
a
turk
for
the
chequered
madras
toque
has
much
the
appearance
of
the
turkish
but
is
lighter
and
even
more
picturesque
now
and
then
an
open
carriage
rolls
by
and
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
ladies
in
their
gossamer
i
hear
their
clear
ringing
laughter
and
i
know
they
are
on
their
way
to
some
gay
festive
scene
the
travellers
upon
the
road
the
labourers
in
the
distant
chanting
their
chorus
songs
occasionally
a
boat
booming
past
on
the
river
more
frequently
a
flat
silently
floating
downward
a
keel
or
a
raft
with
its
crew
are
all
before
my
eyes
emblems
of
active
life
nearer
still
are
the
winged
creatures
that
live
and
move
around
my
window
the
pipes
from
the
top
of
the
tallest
magnolia
and
his
cousin
the
half
intoxicated
with
the
berries
of
the
rivals
him
in
his
sweet
song
the
oriole
hops
among
the
and
the
bold
red
cardinal
spreads
his
scarlet
wings
amidst
the
spray
of
the
lower
shrubbery
now
and
then
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
coming
and
going
like
the
sparkle
of
a
gem
its
favourite
haunt
is
among
the
red
and
scentless
flowers
of
the
or
the
large
blossoms
of
the
such
was
the
view
from
the
window
of
my
chamber
i
thought
i
never
beheld
so
fair
a
scene
perhaps
i
was
not
looking
upon
it
with
an
impartial
eye
the
was
in
my
glance
and
that
may
have
imparted
to
it
a
portion
of
its
de
i
could
not
look
upon
the
scene
without
thinking
of
that
fair
being
whose
presence
alone
was
wanted
to
make
the
picture
perfect
chapter
twenty
my
journal
i
varied
the
monotony
of
my
invalid
existence
by
keeping
a
journal
the
journal
of
a
sick
chamber
must
naturally
be
barren
of
incident
mine
was
a
diary
of
reflections
rather
than
acts
i
transcribe
a
few
passages
from
it
not
on
account
of
any
remarkable
interest
which
they
possess
but
because
dotted
down
at
the
time
they
represent
more
faithfully
some
of
the
thoughts
and
incidents
that
occurred
to
me
during
the
remainder
of
my
stay
on
the
plantation
besancon
i
am
able
to
sit
up
and
write
a
little
the
weather
is
intensely
hot
it
would
be
intolerable
were
it
not
for
the
breeze
which
sweeps
across
my
apartment
charged
with
the
delicious
perfume
of
the
flowers
this
breeze
blows
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
lakes
borgne
pontchartrain
and
maauepas
i
am
more
than
one
hundred
miles
from
the
gulf
itself
that
is
following
the
direction
of
the
river
but
these
great
inland
seas
deeply
penetrate
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
and
through
them
the
tidal
wave
approaches
within
a
few
miles
of
new
orleans
and
still
farther
to
the
north
might
be
reached
through
the
swamps
at
a
short
distance
to
the
rear
of
bringiers
this
is
a
great
benefit
to
the
inhabitants
of
lower
louisiana
without
its
cooling
influence
new
orleans
during
the
summer
months
would
hardly
be
habitable
scipio
tells
me
that
a
new
overseer
has
arrived
on
the
plantation
and
thinks
that
he
has
been
appointed
through
the
agency
of
dominick
he
brought
a
letter
from
the
it
is
therefore
probable
enough
my
attendant
does
not
seem
very
favourably
impressed
with
the
new
comer
whom
he
represents
as
a
poor
white
man
from
de
norf
an
a
yankee
at
daat
among
the
blacks
i
find
existing
an
antipathy
towards
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
poor
white
men
individuals
who
do
not
possess
slave
or
landed
property
the
phrase
itself
expresses
this
antipathy
and
when
applied
by
a
negro
to
a
white
man
is
regarded
by
the
latter
as
a
dire
insult
and
usually
procures
for
the
imprudent
black
a
scoring
with
the
cowskin
or
a
slight
rubbing
down
with
the
oil
of
hickory
among
the
slaves
there
is
a
general
impression
that
their
most
tyrannical
overseers
are
from
the
new
england
states
or
yankees
as
they
are
called
in
the
south
this
term
which
foreigners
apply
contemptuously
to
all
americans
in
the
united
states
has
a
restricted
meaning
and
when
used
reproachfully
it
is
only
applied
to
natives
of
new
england
at
other
times
it
is
used
jocularly
in
a
patriotic
spirit
and
in
this
sense
every
american
is
proud
to
call
himself
a
yankee
among
the
southern
blacks
yankee
is
a
term
of
reproach
associated
in
their
minds
with
poverty
of
fortune
meanness
of
spirit
wooden
nutmegs
cypress
hams
and
chicanes
sad
and
strange
to
say
it
is
also
associated
with
the
whip
the
shackle
and
the
cowhide
strange
because
these
men
are
the
natives
of
a
land
peculiarly
distinguished
for
its
puritanism
a
land
where
the
purest
religion
and
strictest
morality
are
professed
this
would
seem
an
anomaly
and
yet
perhaps
it
is
not
so
much
an
anomaly
after
all
i
had
it
explained
to
me
by
a
southerner
who
spoke
thus
the
countries
where
puritan
principles
prevail
are
those
which
produce
vice
and
particularly
the
smaller
vices
in
greatest
abundance
the
villages
of
new
england
the
foci
of
blue
laws
and
furnish
the
greatest
number
of
the
du
of
new
york
philadelphia
baltimore
and
new
orleans
and
even
furnish
a
large
export
of
them
to
the
catholic
capital
of
cuba
from
the
same
prolific
soil
spring
most
of
the
sharpers
quacks
and
cheating
traders
who
disgrace
the
american
name
this
is
not
an
anomaly
it
is
but
the
inexorable
result
of
a
outward
observance
worship
and
the
various
forms
are
engrafted
in
the
mind
and
thus
by
complicating
the
true
duties
which
man
owes
to
his
obscure
or
take
precedence
of
them
the
latter
grow
to
be
esteemed
as
only
of
secondary
importance
and
are
consequently
neglected
the
explanation
was
at
least
ingenious
twice
visited
by
mademoiselle
who
as
usual
was
accompanied
by
aurore
our
conversation
does
not
flow
easily
or
freely
nor
is
it
of
long
continuance
she
mademoiselle
is
still
evidently
suffering
and
there
is
a
tone
of
sadness
in
everything
she
says
at
first
i
attributed
this
to
her
sorrow
for
antoine
but
it
has
now
continued
too
long
to
be
thus
explained
some
other
grief
presses
upon
her
spirit
i
suffer
from
restraint
the
presence
of
aurore
restrains
me
and
i
can
ill
give
utterance
to
those
required
in
an
ordinary
conversation
she
aurore
takes
no
part
in
the
dialogue
but
lingers
by
the
door
or
stands
behind
her
mistress
respectfully
listening
when
i
regard
her
steadfastly
her
fringed
eyelids
droop
and
shut
out
all
communion
with
her
soul
that
i
could
make
her
understand
scipio
is
confirmed
in
his
dislike
for
the
new
overseer
his
first
impressions
were
correct
from
two
or
three
little
matters
which
i
have
heard
about
this
gentleman
i
am
satisfied
that
he
is
a
bad
successor
to
the
good
antoine
of
poor
antoine
it
was
reported
that
his
body
had
been
washed
up
among
some
below
the
plantation
but
the
report
proved
incorrect
a
body
found
but
not
that
of
the
steward
some
other
unfortunate
who
had
met
with
a
similar
fate
i
wonder
if
the
wretch
who
wounded
me
is
yet
above
water
there
are
still
many
of
the
sufferers
at
bringiers
some
have
died
of
the
injuries
they
received
on
board
the
boat
a
terrible
death
is
this
scalding
by
steam
many
who
fancied
themselves
scarce
injured
are
now
in
their
last
agonies
the
doctor
has
given
me
some
details
that
are
horrifying
one
of
the
men
a
fireman
whose
nose
is
nearly
gone
and
who
is
conscious
that
he
has
but
a
short
while
to
live
requested
to
see
his
face
in
a
upon
the
request
being
granted
he
broke
into
a
diabolical
laugh
crying
out
at
the
same
time
in
a
loud
voice
what
a
damned
ugly
corpse
i
make
this
reckless
indifference
to
life
is
a
characteristic
of
these
wild
boatmen
the
race
of
mike
fink
is
not
extinct
many
true
representatives
of
this
still
navigate
the
great
rivers
of
the
west
much
better
the
doctor
tells
me
that
in
a
week
i
may
leave
my
room
this
is
cheering
and
yet
a
week
seems
a
long
while
to
one
not
used
to
being
caged
in
this
way
the
books
enable
me
to
kill
time
famously
all
honour
to
the
men
who
make
books
scipio
opinion
of
the
new
overseer
is
not
improved
his
name
is
larkin
scipio
says
that
he
is
in
the
village
as
bully
bill
larkin
a
soubriquet
which
may
serve
as
a
key
to
his
character
several
of
the
complain
to
scipio
of
his
severity
which
they
say
is
daily
on
the
increase
he
goes
about
constantly
armed
with
a
cowhide
and
has
already
once
or
twice
made
use
of
it
in
a
barbarous
manner
is
sunday
and
i
can
tell
from
the
hum
that
reaches
me
from
the
negro
quarters
that
it
is
a
day
of
rejoicing
i
can
see
the
blacks
passing
the
levee
road
dressed
in
their
gayest
attire
the
men
in
white
hats
blue
coats
and
shirts
with
enormous
ruffles
the
women
in
gaudy
patterns
of
cotton
and
not
a
few
in
silks
brilliant
enough
for
a
many
carry
silk
parasols
of
course
of
the
brightest
colours
one
would
almost
be
tempted
to
believe
that
in
this
there
was
no
great
hardship
after
all
but
the
sight
of
mr
larkin
cowhide
must
produce
a
very
opposite
impression
i
noticed
more
than
ever
the
melancholy
that
seems
to
press
upon
the
spirit
of
mademoiselle
i
am
now
convinced
that
antoine
death
is
not
the
cause
of
it
there
is
some
source
of
distraction
which
renders
her
ill
at
ease
i
have
again
observed
that
singular
glance
with
which
she
at
first
regarded
me
but
it
was
so
transitory
i
could
not
read
its
meaning
and
my
heart
and
eyes
were
searching
elsewhere
aurore
gazes
upon
me
less
timidly
and
seems
to
be
interested
in
my
conversation
though
it
is
not
addressed
to
her
would
that
it
were
converse
with
her
would
perhaps
relieve
my
heart
which
burns
all
the
more
fiercely
under
the
restraint
of
silence
several
of
the
indulged
too
freely
on
yesternight
they
had
passes
to
the
town
and
came
back
late
bully
bill
has
flogged
them
all
this
morning
and
very
severely
so
as
to
draw
the
blood
from
their
backs
this
is
rough
enough
for
a
overseer
but
scipio
learns
that
he
is
an
old
hand
at
the
business
surely
mademoiselle
does
not
know
of
these
barbarities
the
doctor
promises
to
let
me
out
in
three
days
i
have
grown
to
esteem
this
man
particularly
since
i
made
the
discovery
that
he
is
a
friend
of
gayarre
he
is
not
his
medical
attendant
either
there
is
another
in
the
village
who
has
charge
of
monsieur
dominique
and
his
blacks
as
also
the
slaves
of
the
besancon
plantation
the
latter
chanced
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
so
reigart
was
called
to
me
professional
etiquette
partly
and
partly
my
own
interference
forbade
any
change
in
this
arrangement
and
the
latter
continued
to
attend
me
i
have
seen
the
other
gentleman
who
came
once
in
reigart
company
and
he
appears
much
more
suited
to
be
the
friend
of
the
reigart
is
a
stranger
in
bringiers
but
seems
to
be
rapidly
rising
in
the
esteem
of
the
neighbouring
planters
indeed
many
of
these
the
grandees
among
them
keep
physicians
of
their
own
and
pay
them
handsomely
too
it
would
be
an
unprofitable
speculation
to
neglect
the
health
of
the
slave
and
on
this
account
it
is
better
looked
after
than
that
of
the
poor
white
folks
in
many
a
european
state
i
have
endeavoured
to
draw
from
the
doctor
some
facts
regarding
the
connexion
existing
between
gayarre
and
the
family
of
besancon
i
could
only
make
distant
allusion
to
such
a
subject
i
obtained
no
very
satisfactory
information
the
doctor
is
what
might
be
termed
a
close
man
and
too
much
talking
would
not
make
one
of
his
profession
very
popular
in
louisiana
he
either
knows
but
little
of
their
affairs
or
affects
not
to
know
and
yet
from
some
expressions
that
dropped
from
him
i
suspect
the
latter
to
be
the
more
probable
poor
young
lady
said
he
quite
alone
in
the
world
i
believe
there
is
an
aunt
or
something
of
the
kind
who
lives
in
new
orleans
but
she
has
no
male
relation
to
look
after
her
affairs
gayarre
seems
to
have
everything
in
his
hands
i
gathered
from
the
doctor
that
eugenie
father
had
been
much
richer
at
one
period
one
of
the
most
extensive
planters
on
the
coast
that
he
had
kept
a
sort
of
open
house
and
dispensed
hospitality
in
princely
style
fetes
on
a
grand
scale
had
been
given
and
this
more
particularly
of
late
years
even
since
his
death
profuse
hospitality
has
been
carried
on
and
mademoiselle
continues
to
receive
her
guests
after
her
father
fashion
suitors
she
has
in
plenty
but
the
doctor
has
heard
of
no
one
who
is
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
lover
gayarre
had
been
the
intimate
friend
of
besancon
why
no
one
could
tell
for
their
natures
were
as
opposite
as
the
poles
it
was
thought
by
some
that
their
friendship
had
a
little
of
the
character
of
that
which
usually
exists
between
and
the
information
thus
imparted
by
the
doctor
confirms
what
scipio
has
already
told
me
it
confirms
too
my
suspicions
in
regard
to
the
young
creole
that
there
is
a
cloud
upon
the
horizon
of
her
future
darker
than
any
that
has
shadowed
her
past
darker
even
than
that
produced
by
the
memory
of
antoine
gayarre
has
been
here
at
the
house
i
mean
in
fact
he
visits
mademoiselle
nearly
every
day
but
scipio
tells
me
something
new
and
strange
it
appears
that
some
of
the
slaves
who
had
been
flogged
complained
of
the
overseer
to
their
young
mistress
and
she
in
her
turn
spoke
to
gayarre
on
the
subject
his
reply
was
that
the
black
rascals
deserved
all
they
had
got
and
more
and
somewhat
rudely
upheld
the
ruffian
larkin
who
is
beyond
a
doubt
his
the
lady
was
silent
scipio
learns
these
facts
from
aurore
there
is
something
ominous
in
all
this
poor
scipio
has
made
me
the
confidant
of
another
and
a
private
grief
he
suspects
that
the
overseer
is
looking
too
kindly
upon
him
kettle
chloe
the
brute
if
this
be
so
my
blood
boils
at
the
thought
oh
slavery
i
hear
of
gayarre
again
he
has
been
to
the
house
and
made
a
longer
stay
with
mademoiselle
than
usual
what
can
he
have
to
do
with
her
can
his
society
be
agreeable
to
her
surely
that
is
impossible
and
yet
such
frequent
visits
such
long
conferences
if
she
marry
such
a
man
as
this
i
pity
her
poor
victim
for
victim
will
she
be
he
must
have
some
power
over
her
to
act
as
he
is
doing
he
seems
master
of
the
plantation
says
scipio
and
issues
his
orders
to
every
one
with
the
air
of
its
owner
all
fear
him
and
his
as
the
ruffian
larkin
is
called
the
latter
is
more
feared
by
scipio
who
has
noticed
some
further
rude
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
overseer
towards
him
leettle
chloe
poor
fellow
he
is
greatly
distressed
and
no
wonder
when
even
the
law
does
not
allow
him
to
protect
the
honour
of
his
own
child
i
have
promised
to
speak
to
mademoiselle
about
the
affair
but
i
fear
from
what
reaches
my
ears
that
she
is
almost
as
powerless
as
scipio
himself
for
the
first
time
i
am
able
to
go
out
of
my
room
i
have
taken
a
walk
through
the
shrubbery
and
garden
i
encountered
aurore
among
the
gathering
the
golden
fruit
but
she
was
accompanied
by
little
chloe
who
held
the
basket
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
have
found
her
alone
a
word
or
two
only
was
i
able
to
exchange
with
her
and
she
was
gone
she
expressed
her
pleasure
at
seeing
me
able
to
be
abroad
she
pleased
i
fancied
she
felt
so
i
never
saw
her
look
so
lovely
the
exercise
of
shaking
down
the
oranges
had
brought
out
the
rich
crimson
bloom
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
large
brown
eyes
were
shining
like
sapphires
her
full
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
her
excited
breathing
and
the
light
wrapper
she
wore
enabled
me
to
trace
the
noble
outlines
of
her
form
i
was
struck
with
the
gracefulness
of
her
gait
as
she
walked
away
it
exhibited
an
undulating
motion
produced
by
a
peculiarity
of
figure
a
certain
characteristic
of
her
race
she
was
large
and
womanly
yet
of
perfect
proportion
and
fine
delicate
outlines
her
hands
were
small
and
slender
and
her
little
feet
seemed
hardly
to
press
upon
the
pebbles
my
eyes
followed
her
in
a
delirium
of
admiration
the
fire
in
my
heart
burned
fiercer
as
i
returned
to
my
solitary
chamber
chapter
twenty
one
a
change
of
quarters
i
was
thinking
over
my
short
interview
with
aurore
congratulating
myself
upon
some
expressions
she
had
dropped
happy
in
the
anticipation
that
such
encounters
would
recur
frequently
now
that
i
was
able
to
be
abroad
when
in
the
midst
of
my
pleasant
reverie
the
door
of
my
apartment
became
darkened
i
looked
up
and
beheld
the
hated
face
of
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
it
was
his
first
visit
since
the
morning
after
my
arrival
upon
the
plantation
what
could
want
with
i
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
for
my
visitor
without
even
apologising
for
his
intrusion
opened
his
business
abruptly
and
at
once
monsieur
began
he
i
have
made
arrangements
for
your
removal
to
the
hotel
at
bringiers
you
have
said
i
interrupting
him
in
a
tone
as
abrupt
and
something
more
indignant
than
his
own
and
who
sir
may
i
ask
has
commissioned
to
take
this
trouble
ah
oh
stammered
he
somewhat
tamed
down
by
his
brusque
reception
i
beg
pardon
monsieur
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
i
am
the
agent
the
friend
in
fact
the
guardian
of
mademoiselle
besancon
and
and
is
it
mademoiselle
besancon
wish
that
i
go
to
bringiers
well
the
truth
is
not
exactly
her
wish
but
you
see
my
dear
sir
it
is
a
delicate
affair
your
remaining
here
now
that
you
are
almost
quite
recovered
upon
which
i
congratulate
you
and
and
go
on
sir
your
remaining
here
any
longer
under
the
circumstances
would
be
you
can
judge
for
yourself
sir
would
be
in
fact
a
thing
that
would
be
talked
about
in
the
neighbourhood
in
fact
considered
highly
improper
hold
monsieur
gayarre
i
am
old
enough
not
to
require
lessons
in
etiquette
from
you
sir
i
beg
pardon
sir
i
do
not
mean
that
but
i
you
will
observe
i
as
the
lawful
guardian
of
the
young
lady
enough
sir
i
understand
you
perfectly
for
purposes
whatever
they
you
do
not
wish
me
to
remain
any
longer
on
this
plantation
your
desire
shall
be
gratified
i
shall
leave
the
place
though
certainly
not
with
any
intention
of
accommodating
you
i
shall
go
hence
this
very
evening
the
words
upon
which
i
had
placed
emphasis
startled
the
coward
like
a
galvanic
shock
i
saw
him
turn
pale
as
they
were
uttered
and
the
wrinkles
deepened
about
his
eyes
i
had
touched
a
chord
which
he
deemed
a
secret
one
and
its
music
sounded
harsh
to
him
however
he
commanded
himself
and
without
taking
notice
of
my
insinuation
replied
in
a
tone
of
whining
hypocrisy
my
dear
monsieur
i
regret
this
necessity
but
the
fact
is
you
see
the
world
the
busy
meddling
world
spare
your
homilies
sir
your
business
i
fancy
is
ended
at
all
events
your
company
is
no
longer
desired
humph
muttered
he
i
regret
you
should
take
it
in
this
way
i
am
sorry
and
with
a
string
of
similar
incoherent
phrases
he
made
his
exit
i
stepped
up
to
the
door
and
looked
after
to
see
which
way
he
would
take
he
walked
direct
to
the
house
i
saw
him
go
in
this
visit
and
its
object
had
taken
me
by
surprise
though
i
had
not
been
without
some
anticipation
of
such
an
event
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
between
him
and
the
doctor
rendered
it
probable
that
such
would
be
the
result
though
i
hardly
expected
being
obliged
to
change
my
quarters
so
soon
for
another
week
or
two
i
had
intended
to
stay
where
i
was
when
quite
recovered
i
should
have
moved
to
the
hotel
of
my
own
accord
i
felt
vexed
and
for
several
reasons
it
chagrined
me
to
think
that
this
wretch
possessed
such
a
controlling
influence
for
i
did
not
believe
that
mademoiselle
besancon
had
anything
to
do
with
my
removal
quite
the
contrary
she
had
visited
me
but
a
few
hours
before
and
not
a
word
had
been
said
of
the
matter
perhaps
she
might
have
thought
of
it
and
did
not
desire
to
mention
it
but
no
this
could
hardly
be
i
noticed
no
change
in
her
manner
during
the
interview
the
same
kindness
the
same
interest
in
my
recovery
the
same
solicitude
about
the
little
arrangements
of
my
food
and
attendance
were
shown
by
her
up
to
the
last
moment
she
evidently
contemplated
no
change
so
sudden
as
that
proposed
by
gayarre
reflection
convinced
me
that
the
proposal
had
been
made
without
any
previous
communication
with
what
must
be
the
influence
of
this
man
that
he
dare
thus
step
between
her
and
the
rites
of
hospitality
it
was
a
painful
thought
to
me
to
see
this
fair
creature
in
the
power
of
such
a
villain
but
another
thought
was
still
more
painful
the
thought
of
parting
with
aurore
though
i
did
not
fancy
that
parting
was
to
be
for
ever
no
had
i
believed
that
i
should
not
have
yielded
so
easily
i
should
have
put
monsieur
dominique
to
the
necessity
of
a
positive
expulsion
of
course
i
had
no
apprehension
that
by
removing
to
the
village
i
should
be
debarred
from
visiting
the
plantation
as
often
as
i
felt
inclined
had
that
been
the
condition
my
reflections
would
have
been
painful
indeed
after
all
the
change
would
signify
little
i
should
return
as
a
visitor
and
in
that
character
be
more
independent
than
as
a
guest
more
free
perhaps
to
approach
the
object
of
my
love
i
could
come
as
often
as
i
pleased
the
same
opportunities
of
seeing
her
would
still
be
open
to
me
i
wanted
but
one
one
moment
alone
with
aurore
and
then
bliss
or
blighted
hopes
but
there
were
other
considerations
that
troubled
me
at
this
moment
how
was
i
to
live
at
the
hotel
would
the
proprietor
believe
in
promises
and
wait
until
my
letters
already
sent
off
could
be
answered
already
i
had
been
provided
with
suitable
apparel
mysteriously
indeed
i
awoke
one
morning
and
found
it
by
my
bedside
i
made
no
inquiry
as
to
how
it
came
there
that
would
be
an
but
with
regard
to
money
how
was
that
to
be
obtained
must
i
become
debtor
or
am
i
to
be
under
obligations
to
gayarre
cruel
dilemma
at
this
juncture
i
thought
of
reigart
his
calm
kind
face
came
up
before
me
an
alternative
soliloquised
i
he
will
help
me
the
thought
seemed
to
have
summoned
him
for
at
that
moment
the
good
doctor
entered
the
room
and
became
the
confidant
of
my
wishes
i
had
not
misjudged
him
his
purse
lay
open
upon
the
table
and
i
became
his
debtor
for
as
much
of
its
contents
as
i
stood
in
need
of
very
strange
said
he
this
desire
of
hurrying
you
off
on
the
part
of
monsieur
gayarre
there
is
something
more
in
it
than
solicitude
for
the
character
of
the
lady
something
more
what
can
it
all
mean
the
doctor
said
this
partly
in
soliloquy
and
as
if
searching
his
own
thoughts
for
an
answer
i
am
almost
a
stranger
to
mademoiselle
besancon
he
continued
else
i
should
deem
it
my
duty
to
know
more
of
this
matter
but
monsieur
gayarre
is
her
guardian
and
if
he
desire
you
to
leave
it
will
perhaps
be
wiser
to
do
so
may
not
be
her
own
mistress
poor
thing
i
fear
there
is
debt
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
and
if
so
she
will
be
more
a
slave
than
any
of
her
own
people
poor
young
lady
reigart
was
right
my
remaining
longer
might
add
to
her
embarrassments
i
felt
satisfied
of
this
i
am
desirous
to
go
at
once
doctor
my
barouche
is
at
the
gate
then
you
can
have
a
seat
in
it
i
can
set
you
down
at
the
hotel
thanks
thanks
the
very
thing
i
should
have
asked
of
you
and
i
accept
your
offer
i
have
but
few
preparations
to
make
and
will
be
ready
for
you
in
a
moment
shall
i
step
over
to
the
house
and
prepare
mademoiselle
for
your
departure
be
so
kind
i
believe
gayarre
is
now
there
no
i
met
him
near
the
gate
of
his
own
plantation
returning
home
i
think
she
is
alone
i
shall
see
her
and
return
for
you
the
doctor
left
me
and
walked
over
to
the
house
he
was
absent
but
a
few
minutes
when
he
returned
to
make
his
report
he
was
still
further
perplexed
at
what
he
had
learnt
mademoiselle
had
heard
from
gayarre
just
an
hour
before
that
had
expressed
my
of
removing
to
the
hotel
she
had
been
surprised
at
this
as
i
had
said
nothing
about
it
at
our
late
interview
she
would
not
hear
of
it
at
first
but
gayarre
had
used
to
convince
her
of
the
policy
of
such
a
step
and
the
doctor
on
my
part
had
also
urged
it
she
had
at
length
though
reluctantly
consented
such
was
the
report
of
the
doctor
who
further
informed
me
that
she
was
waiting
to
receive
me
guided
by
scipio
i
made
my
way
to
the
i
found
her
seated
but
upon
my
entrance
she
rose
and
came
forward
to
meet
me
with
both
hands
extended
i
saw
that
was
in
is
it
true
you
intend
leaving
us
monsieur
yes
mademoiselle
i
am
now
quite
strong
again
i
have
come
to
thank
you
for
your
kind
hospitality
and
say
adieu
hospitality
ah
monsieur
you
have
reason
to
think
it
cold
hospitality
since
i
permit
you
to
leave
us
so
soon
i
would
you
had
remained
but
here
she
became
embarrassed
but
you
are
not
to
be
a
stranger
although
you
go
to
the
hotel
bringiers
is
near
promise
that
you
will
visit
us
often
in
fact
every
day
i
need
not
say
that
the
promise
was
freely
and
joyfully
given
now
said
she
since
you
have
given
that
promise
with
less
regret
i
can
say
adieu
she
extended
her
hand
for
a
parting
salute
i
took
her
fingers
in
mine
and
respectfully
kissed
them
i
saw
the
tears
freshly
filling
in
her
eyes
as
she
turned
away
to
conceal
them
i
was
convinced
she
was
acting
under
constraint
and
against
her
inclination
else
i
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
depart
hers
was
not
the
spirit
to
fear
gossip
or
scandal
some
other
was
upon
her
i
was
passing
out
through
the
hall
my
eyes
eagerly
turning
in
every
direction
where
was
was
i
not
to
have
a
parting
at
that
moment
a
was
gently
opened
my
heart
beat
wildly
as
it
turned
upon
its
hinge
aurore
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
speak
aloud
it
would
have
been
overheard
in
the
a
look
a
whisper
a
silent
pressure
of
the
hand
and
i
hurried
away
but
the
return
of
that
pressure
slight
and
almost
imperceptible
as
it
was
fired
my
veins
with
delight
and
i
walked
on
towards
the
gate
with
the
proud
step
of
a
conqueror
chapter
twenty
two
aurore
loves
me
loves
the
thought
thus
expressed
was
of
younger
date
than
the
day
of
my
removing
to
bringiers
from
the
plantation
a
month
had
elapsed
since
that
day
the
details
of
my
life
during
that
month
would
possess
but
little
interest
for
you
reader
though
to
me
every
hour
was
fraught
with
hopes
or
fears
that
still
hold
a
vivid
place
in
my
memory
when
the
heart
is
charged
with
love
every
trifle
connected
with
that
love
assumes
the
magnitude
of
an
important
matter
and
thoughts
or
incidents
that
otherwise
would
soon
be
forgotten
hold
a
firm
place
in
the
memory
i
could
write
a
volume
about
my
affairs
of
that
month
every
line
of
which
would
be
deeply
interesting
to
but
not
to
therefore
i
write
it
not
i
shall
not
even
present
you
with
the
journal
that
holds
its
history
i
continued
to
live
in
the
hotel
at
bringiers
i
grew
rapidly
stronger
i
spent
most
of
my
time
in
rambling
through
the
fields
and
along
the
levee
boating
upon
the
river
fishing
in
the
bayous
hunting
through
the
and
and
occasionally
killing
time
at
a
game
of
billiards
for
every
louisiana
village
has
its
billiard
salon
the
society
of
reigart
whom
i
now
called
friend
i
enjoyed
when
his
professional
engagements
permitted
his
books
too
were
my
friends
and
from
these
i
drew
my
first
lessons
in
botany
i
studied
the
of
the
surrounding
woods
till
at
a
glance
i
could
distinguish
every
tree
and
its
kind
the
giant
cypress
emblem
of
sorrow
with
tall
shaft
shooting
out
of
the
apex
of
its
pyramidal
base
and
crowned
with
its
full
head
of
sad
dark
foliage
sadder
from
its
drapery
of
the
tupelo
that
nymph
that
loves
the
water
with
long
delicate
leaves
and
fruit
the
persimmon
or
american
lotus
with
its
beautiful
green
foliage
and
red
the
gorgeous
magnolia
grandiflora
and
its
congener
the
tall
the
and
of
the
same
genus
the
whose
light
pinnated
leaves
scarce
veil
the
sun
the
sycamore
with
its
smooth
trunk
and
limbs
of
silvery
hue
the
exuding
its
golden
drops
the
aromatic
but
sanitary
sassafras
the
of
aroma
the
oaks
of
many
species
at
the
head
of
which
might
be
placed
that
majestic
evergreen
of
the
southern
forests
the
the
red
ash
with
its
hanging
bunches
of
the
shady
with
its
large
cordate
leaves
and
black
drupes
and
last
though
not
least
interesting
the
such
is
the
sylva
that
covers
the
alluvion
of
louisiana
it
is
a
region
beyond
the
limits
of
the
true
but
this
has
its
representative
in
the
palmetto
latanier
of
the
french
the
palm
of
the
botanist
of
more
than
one
species
forming
in
many
places
the
underwood
and
giving
a
tropical
character
to
the
forest
i
studied
the
parasites
the
huge
llianas
with
branches
like
black
and
gnarled
the
with
pretty
flowers
the
muscadine
with
their
dark
purple
clusters
the
with
corollas
the
among
which
are
conspicuous
the
the
thick
and
the
balsamic
sarsaparilla
not
less
interesting
were
the
vegetable
forms
of
cultivation
the
staples
from
which
are
drawn
the
wealth
of
the
land
these
were
the
the
the
maize
and
the
cotton
shrub
and
the
indigo
all
were
new
to
me
and
i
studied
their
propagation
and
culture
with
interest
though
a
month
apparently
passed
in
idleness
it
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
profitably
employed
of
my
life
in
that
short
month
i
acquired
more
real
knowledge
than
i
had
done
during
years
of
classic
study
but
i
had
learnt
one
fact
that
i
prized
above
all
and
that
was
that
was
beloved
by
i
learnt
it
not
from
her
lips
no
words
had
given
me
the
assurance
and
yet
i
was
certain
that
it
so
certain
as
that
i
lived
not
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
could
have
given
me
the
pleasure
of
that
one
thought
loves
this
was
my
exclamation
as
one
morning
i
emerged
from
the
village
upon
the
road
leading
to
the
plantation
three
times
a
week
sometimes
even
more
frequently
i
had
made
this
journey
sometimes
i
encountered
strangers
at
the
house
friends
of
mademoiselle
sometimes
i
found
her
alone
or
in
company
with
aurore
the
latter
i
could
never
find
alone
oh
how
i
longed
for
that
opportunity
my
visits
of
course
were
ostensibly
to
mademoiselle
i
dared
not
seek
an
interflow
with
the
slave
eugenie
still
preserved
the
air
of
melancholy
that
now
appeared
to
have
settled
upon
her
sometimes
she
was
even
sad
at
no
time
cheerful
as
i
was
not
made
the
confidant
of
her
sorrows
i
could
only
guess
at
the
cause
gayarre
of
course
i
believed
to
be
the
fiend
of
him
i
had
learnt
little
he
shunned
me
on
the
road
or
in
the
fields
and
upon
grounds
i
never
trespassed
i
found
that
he
was
held
in
but
little
respect
except
among
those
who
worshipped
his
wealth
how
he
was
prospering
in
his
suit
with
eugenie
i
knew
not
the
world
talked
of
such
a
thing
as
among
the
probabilities
though
one
of
the
strange
ones
it
was
deemed
i
had
sympathy
for
the
young
creole
but
i
might
have
felt
it
more
profoundly
under
other
circumstances
as
it
was
my
whole
soul
was
under
the
influence
of
a
stronger
passion
my
love
for
aurore
yes
aurore
loves
me
i
repeated
to
myself
as
i
passed
out
from
the
village
and
faced
down
the
levee
road
i
was
mounted
reigart
in
his
generous
hospitality
had
even
made
me
master
of
a
horse
a
fine
animal
that
rose
buoyantly
under
me
as
though
he
was
also
imbued
by
some
noble
passion
my
steed
followed
the
path
without
need
of
guidance
and
dropping
the
bridle
upon
his
neck
i
left
him
to
go
at
will
and
pursued
the
train
of
my
reflections
i
loved
this
young
girl
passionately
and
devotedly
i
loved
her
she
loved
me
she
had
not
declared
it
in
words
but
her
looks
and
now
and
then
a
slight
incident
scarce
more
than
a
fleeting
glance
or
gesture
had
convinced
me
that
it
was
so
love
taught
me
its
own
language
i
needed
no
interpreter
no
tongue
to
tell
i
was
beloved
these
reflections
were
pleasant
far
more
than
pleasant
but
others
followed
them
of
a
very
different
nature
with
whom
was
i
in
love
a
slave
true
a
beautiful
slave
but
still
a
slave
how
the
world
would
laugh
how
louisiana
would
laugh
nay
scorn
and
persecute
the
very
proposal
to
make
her
my
wife
would
subject
me
to
derision
and
abuse
what
marry
a
slave
is
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
land
dared
i
to
marry
her
even
were
she
free
she
a
i
should
be
hunted
from
the
land
or
shut
up
in
one
of
its
prisons
all
this
i
knew
but
not
one
straw
cared
i
for
it
the
world
obloquy
in
one
scale
my
love
for
aurore
in
the
other
the
former
weighed
but
a
feather
true
i
had
deep
regret
that
aurore
was
a
slave
but
it
sprang
not
from
that
consideration
far
different
was
the
reason
of
my
regret
was
i
to
obtain
her
that
was
the
question
that
troubled
me
up
to
this
time
i
had
made
light
of
the
matter
before
i
knew
that
i
was
beloved
it
seemed
a
sequence
very
remote
but
it
was
now
brought
nearer
and
all
the
faculties
of
my
mind
became
concentrated
on
that
one
thought
how
was
i
to
obtain
her
freedom
had
she
been
an
ordinary
slave
the
answer
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
though
not
rich
my
fortune
was
still
equal
to
the
of
a
human
in
my
eyes
aurore
was
priceless
would
she
also
appear
so
in
the
eyes
of
her
young
mistress
was
my
bride
for
sale
on
any
terms
but
even
if
money
should
be
deemed
an
equivalent
would
mademoiselle
her
to
an
odd
proposal
that
of
buying
slave
for
my
wife
what
would
eugenie
besancon
think
of
it
the
very
idea
of
this
proposal
awed
me
but
the
time
to
make
it
had
not
yet
arrived
i
must
first
have
an
interview
with
aurore
demand
a
confession
of
her
love
and
then
if
she
consent
to
become
mine
the
rest
may
be
arranged
i
see
not
clearly
the
way
but
a
love
like
mine
will
triumph
over
everything
my
passion
nerves
me
with
power
with
courage
with
energy
obstacles
must
yield
opposing
wills
be
coaxed
or
crushed
everything
must
give
way
that
stands
between
myself
and
my
love
aurore
i
come
i
come
chapter
twenty
three
a
surprise
my
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
neighing
of
my
horse
i
glanced
forward
to
ascertain
the
cause
i
was
opposite
the
plantation
besancon
a
carriage
was
just
wheeling
out
from
the
gate
the
horses
were
headed
down
the
levee
road
and
going
off
at
a
trot
were
soon
lost
behind
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
hoofs
and
wheels
i
recognised
the
carriage
it
was
the
barouche
of
mademoiselle
besancon
i
could
not
tell
who
were
its
occupants
though
from
the
slight
glimpse
i
had
got
of
them
i
saw
there
were
ladies
in
it
mademoiselle
herself
accompanied
by
aurore
no
doubt
i
believed
that
they
had
not
observed
me
as
the
high
fence
concealed
all
but
my
head
and
the
carriage
had
turned
abruptly
on
passing
out
of
the
gate
i
felt
disappointed
i
had
had
my
ride
for
nothing
and
might
now
ride
back
again
to
bringiers
i
had
drawn
bridle
with
this
intent
when
it
occurred
to
me
i
could
still
overtake
the
carriage
and
change
words
with
its
occupants
with
even
the
interchange
of
a
glance
was
worth
such
a
gallop
i
laid
the
spur
to
the
ribs
of
my
horse
and
sprang
him
forward
as
i
came
opposite
the
house
i
saw
scipio
by
the
gate
he
was
just
closing
it
after
the
carriage
oh
thought
i
i
may
as
well
be
sure
as
to
whom
i
am
galloping
after
with
this
idea
i
inclined
my
horse
head
a
little
and
drew
up
in
front
of
scipio
gollies
how
young
ride
ef
he
do
do
daat
business
jes
up
to
de
hub
daat
do
wugh
without
taking
notice
of
his
complimentary
speech
i
inquired
hastily
if
mademoiselle
was
at
home
no
she
jes
dis
moment
gone
out
she
drive
to
marigny
alone
ye
of
course
aurore
is
with
her
no
she
gone
out
by
harseff
she
at
home
if
the
negro
had
been
observant
he
might
have
noticed
the
effect
of
this
announcement
upon
me
for
i
am
sure
it
must
have
been
sufficiently
apparent
i
felt
it
in
the
instant
upheaving
of
my
heart
and
the
flushing
that
suddenly
fevered
my
cheeks
aurore
at
home
and
alone
it
was
the
first
time
during
all
the
course
of
my
wooing
that
such
a
chance
had
offered
and
i
almost
gave
expression
to
my
agreeable
surprise
fortunately
i
did
not
for
even
the
faithful
scipio
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
such
a
secret
with
an
effort
i
collected
myself
and
tamed
down
my
horse
now
chafing
to
continue
his
gallop
in
doing
so
his
head
was
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
village
scipio
thought
i
was
going
to
ride
back
sure
not
go
till
he
rest
a
bit
missa
not
home
but
dar
am
get
glass
ob
claret

um
sangaree
day
berry
berry
hot
wugh
you
are
about
right
scipio
i
replied
pretending
to
yield
to
his
persuasion
take
my
horse
round
to
the
stable
i
shall
rest
a
few
minutes
i
dismounted
and
passing
the
bridle
to
scipio
stepped
inside
the
gate
it
was
about
a
hundred
paces
to
the
house
by
the
direct
walk
that
led
from
the
gate
to
the
front
door
but
there
were
two
other
paths
that
wound
around
the
sides
of
the
shrubbery
through
copses
of
low
trees
laurels
myrtles
and
oranges
a
person
approaching
by
either
of
these
could
not
be
seen
from
the
house
until
close
to
the
very
windows
from
each
of
these
paths
the
low
verandah
could
be
reached
without
going
by
the
front
there
were
steps
leading
into
it
into
the
interior
of
the
house
as
well
for
the
windows
that
fronted
upon
the
verandah
were
after
the
creole
fashion
glass
that
opened
to
the
bottom
so
that
the
floors
of
the
rooms
and
were
upon
the
same
level
on
passing
through
the
gate
i
turned
into
one
of
these
for
certain
reasons
giving
it
the
preference
and
walked
silently
on
towards
the
house
i
had
taken
the
longer
way
and
advanced
slowly
for
the
purpose
of
composing
myself
i
could
hear
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
and
feel
its
quick
nervous
throbs
quicker
than
my
steps
as
i
approached
the
interview
i
believe
i
should
have
been
more
collected
in
going
up
to
the
muzzle
of
an
antagonist
pistol
the
long
yearning
for
such
an
opportunity
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
it
the
anticipation
of
that
sweetest
pleasure
on
earth
the
pleasure
of
being
alone
with
her
i
loved
all
blended
in
my
thoughts
no
wonder
they
were
wild
and
somewhat
bewildered
i
should
now
meet
aurore
face
to
face
alone
with
but
love
god
as
a
witness
i
should
speak
unrestrainedly
and
free
i
should
hear
voice
listen
to
the
soft
confession
that
she
loved
me
i
should
fold
her
in
my
arms
against
my
bosom
i
should
drink
love
from
her
swimming
eyes
taste
it
on
her
crimson
cheek
her
coral
lips
oh
i
should
speak
love
and
hear
it
spoken
i
should
listen
to
its
delirious
ravings
a
heaven
of
happiness
was
before
me
no
wonder
my
thoughts
were
wild
no
wonder
i
vainly
strove
to
calm
them
i
reached
the
house
and
mounted
the
two
or
three
steps
that
led
up
into
the
verandah
the
latter
was
carpeted
with
a
mat
of
and
my
was
light
so
that
my
tread
was
as
silent
as
that
of
a
girl
it
could
scarce
have
been
heard
within
the
chamber
whose
windows
i
was
passing
i
proceeded
on
toward
the
which
opened
to
the
front
by
two
of
the
large
already
mentioned
i
turned
the
angle
and
the
next
moment
would
have
passed
the
first
of
these
windows
had
a
sound
not
reached
me
that
caused
me
to
arrest
my
steps
the
sound
was
a
voice
that
came
from
the
whose
windows
stood
open
i
listened
it
was
the
voice
of
aurore
in
conversation
with
some
one
with
whom
perhaps
little
chloe
her
mother
some
one
of
the
domestics
i
listened
by
heaven
it
is
the
voice
of
a
man
who
can
he
be
scipio
no
scipio
can
not
yet
have
left
the
stable
it
can
not
be
he
some
other
of
the
plantation
people
jules
the
the
baptiste
ha
it
is
not
a
negro
voice
no
it
is
the
voice
of
a
white
man
the
overseer
as
this
idea
came
into
my
head
a
pang
at
the
same
time
shot
through
my
heart
a
pang
not
of
jealousy
but
something
like
it
i
was
angry
at
rather
than
jealous
with
as
yet
i
had
heard
nothing
to
make
me
jealous
his
being
present
with
her
and
in
conversation
was
no
cause
so
my
bold
thought
i
you
have
got
over
your
predilection
for
the
little
chloe
not
to
be
wondered
at
who
would
waste
time
gazing
at
stars
when
there
is
such
a
moon
in
the
sky
brute
that
you
are
you
are
not
blind
i
see
you
too
have
an
eye
to
opportunities
and
know
when
to
enter
the
hush
again
i
listened
when
i
had
first
halted
it
was
through
motives
of
delicacy
i
did
not
wish
to
appear
too
suddenly
before
the
open
window
which
would
have
given
me
a
full
view
of
the
interior
of
the
apartment
i
had
paused
intending
to
herald
my
approach
by
some
noise
a
feigned
cough
or
a
stroke
of
my
foot
against
the
floor
my
motives
had
undergone
a
change
i
now
listened
with
a
design
i
could
not
help
it
aurore
was
speaking
i
bent
my
ear
close
to
the
window
the
voice
was
at
too
great
a
distance
or
uttered
too
low
for
me
to
hear
what
was
said
i
could
hear
the
silvery
tones
but
could
not
distinguish
the
words
she
must
be
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
thought
i
upon
the
this
conjecture
led
me
to
painful
imaginings
till
the
throbbings
of
my
heart
drowned
the
murmur
that
was
causing
them
at
length
aurore
speech
was
ended
i
waited
for
the
reply
perhaps
i
might
gather
from
that
what
had
said
the
tones
of
the
male
voice
would
be
loud
enough
to
enable
me
hush
hark
i
listened
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
voice
but
not
the
words
the
sound
was
enough
it
caused
me
to
start
as
if
stung
by
an
adder
was
the
voice
of
monsieur
dominique
chapter
twenty
four
a
rival
i
can
not
describe
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
this
discovery
it
was
like
a
shock
of
paralysis
it
nailed
me
to
the
spot
and
for
some
moments
i
felt
as
rigid
as
a
statue
and
almost
as
senseless
even
had
the
words
uttered
by
gayarre
been
loud
enough
to
reach
me
i
should
scarce
have
heard
them
my
surprise
for
the
moment
had
rendered
me
deaf
the
antagonism
i
had
conceived
towards
the
speaker
so
long
as
i
believed
it
to
be
the
brute
larkin
was
of
a
gentle
character
compared
with
that
which
agitated
me
now
larkin
might
be
young
and
handsome
by
scipio
account
the
latter
he
certainly
was
but
even
so
i
had
little
fear
of
rivalry
i
felt
confident
that
i
held
the
heart
of
aurore
and
i
knew
that
the
overseer
had
no
power
over
he
was
overseer
of
the
and
other
slaves
of
the
plantation
their
master
with
full
licence
of
tongue
and
lash
but
with
all
that
i
knew
that
he
had
no
authority
over
aurore
for
reasons
i
could
not
fathom
the
treatment
of
the
quadroon
was
and
had
always
been
different
from
the
other
slaves
of
the
plantation
it
was
not
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
her
beauty
neither
that
had
gained
her
this
distinction
these
it
is
true
often
modify
the
hard
lot
of
the
female
slave
sometimes
detailing
upon
her
a
still
more
cruel
fate
but
in
the
case
of
aurore
there
was
some
very
different
reason
for
the
kindness
shown
her
though
could
only
at
it
she
had
been
tenderly
reared
alongside
her
young
mistress
had
received
almost
as
good
an
education
and
in
fact
was
treated
rather
as
a
than
a
except
from
mademoiselle
she
received
no
commands
the
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
i
had
therefore
no
dread
of
any
unlawful
influence
on
his
part
far
different
were
my
suspicions
when
i
found
the
voice
belonged
to
gayarre
had
power
not
only
over
the
slave
but
the
mistress
as
well
though
suitor
as
i
still
believed
him
of
mademoiselle
he
could
not
be
blind
to
the
superior
charms
of
aurore
hideous
wretch
as
i
thought
him
he
might
for
all
be
sensible
to
love
the
plainest
may
have
a
passion
for
the
fairest
the
beast
loved
beauty
the
hour
he
had
chosen
for
his
visit
too
that
was
suspicious
of
itself
just
as
mademoiselle
had
driven
out
had
he
been
there
before
she
went
out
and
been
left
by
her
in
the
house
not
likely
scipio
know
nothing
of
his
being
there
else
he
would
have
told
me
the
black
was
aware
of
my
antipathy
to
gayarre
and
that
i
did
not
desire
to
meet
him
he
would
certainly
have
told
me
no
doubt
thought
i
the
visit
is
a
stolen
one
the
lawyer
has
come
the
back
way
from
his
own
plantation
has
watched
till
the
carriage
drove
off
and
then
skulked
in
for
the
very
purpose
of
finding
the
quadroon
alone
all
this
flashed
upon
my
mind
with
the
force
of
conviction
i
no
longer
doubted
that
his
presence
there
was
the
result
of
design
and
not
a
mere
accident
he
was
aurore
my
thoughts
took
this
homely
shape
when
the
first
shock
of
my
surprise
had
passed
away
my
senses
returned
fuller
and
more
vigorous
than
ever
my
nerves
seemed
freshly
strung
and
my
ears
new
set
i
placed
them
as
close
to
the
open
window
as
prudence
would
allow
and
listened
it
was
not
i
own
but
in
dealing
with
this
wretch
i
seemed
to
lose
all
sense
of
honour
by
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
that
moment
i
was
tempted
from
the
strict
path
but
it
was
the
eavesdropping
of
a
jealous
lover
and
i
cry
you
mercy
for
the
act
i
listened
with
an
effort
i
stifled
the
feverish
throbbings
of
my
heart
and
listened
and
i
heard
every
word
that
from
that
moment
was
said
the
voices
had
become
louder
or
rather
the
speakers
had
approached
nearer
they
were
but
a
few
feet
from
the
window
gayarre
was
speaking
and
does
this
young
fellow
dare
to
make
love
to
your
mistress
monsieur
dominique
how
should
i
know
i
am
sure
i
never
saw
aught
of
the
kind
he
is
very
modest
and
so
mademoiselle
thinks
him
i
never
knew
him
to
speak
one
word
of
love
not
he
i
fancied
i
heard
a
sigh
if
he
dare
rejoined
gayarre
in
a
tone
of
bravado
if
he
dare
hint
at
such
a
thing
to
mademoiselle
ay
or
to
aurore
i
shall
make
the
place
too
hot
for
him
he
shall
visit
here
no
more
the
naked
adventurer
on
that
i
am
resolved
oh
monsieur
gayarre
i
sure
that
would
vex
mademoiselle
very
much
remember
he
saved
her
life
she
is
full
of
gratitude
to
him
she
continually
talks
of
it
and
it
would
grieve
her
if
monsieur
edouard
was
to
come
no
more
i
am
sure
it
would
grieve
her
there
was
an
earnestness
a
in
the
tone
of
the
speaker
that
sounded
pleasant
to
my
ears
it
suggested
the
idea
that
too
might
be
if
monsieur
edouard
were
to
come
no
more
a
like
thought
seemed
to
occur
to
gayarre
upon
whom
however
it
made
a
very
different
sort
of
impression
there
was
irony
mixed
with
anger
in
his
reply
which
was
half
interrogative
perhaps
it
would
grieve
one
perhaps
you
all
indeed
is
it
so
you
love
him
there
was
a
hissing
emphasis
upon
the
concluding
word
that
expressed
anger
and
pain
the
pain
of
bitter
jealousy
oh
monsieur
replied
the
quadroon
how
can
you
speak
thus
love
i
a
poor
slave
alas
alas
neither
the
tone
nor
substance
of
this
speech
exactly
pleased
me
i
felt
a
hope
however
that
it
was
but
one
of
the
little
stratagems
of
love
a
species
of
deceit
i
could
easily
pardon
it
seemed
to
produce
a
pleasant
effect
on
gayarre
for
all
at
once
his
voice
changed
to
a
lighter
and
gayer
tone
you
a
beautiful
aurore

the
quadroon
interrupting
him

monsieur
she
is
not
capricious

gayarre
interrupting
in
his
turn
and
again
assuming
his
tone
of
bravado
what
care

if
she
did
think

i
trouble
my
head
about

it
if
you

my

monsieur
enough
your
insult
i
hear
no
more
the
voice
was
firm
and
indignant
hurrah
nay
dearest
loveliest
aurore
do
not
go
yet
hear
me
i
hear
no
more
sir
mademoiselle
shall
know
a
word
a
word
one
kiss
aurore
on
my
knees
i
beg
i
heard
the
knocking
of
a
pair
of
knees
on
the
floor
followed
by
a
struggling
sound
and
loud
angry
exclamations
on
the
part
of
aurore
this
i
considered
to
be
my
cue
and
three
steps
brought
me
within
the
room
and
within
as
many
feet
of
the
kneeling
gallant
the
wretch
was
actually
on
his
holding
the
girl
by
the
wrist
and
endeavouring
to
draw
her
towards
him
she
on
the
contrary
was
exerting
all
her
women
strength
to
get
away
which
not
being
so
inconsiderable
resulted
in
the
ludicrous
spectacle
of
the
kneeling
suitor
being
dragged
somewhat
rapidly
across
the
carpet
his
back
was
toward
me
as
i
entered
and
the
first
intimation
he
had
of
my
presence
was
a
boisterous
laugh
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
restrain
it
lasted
until
long
after
he
had
released
his
captive
and
gathered
his
limbs
into
an
upright
position
and
indeed
so
loud
did
it
sound
in
my
own
ears
that
i
did
not
hear
the
threats
of
vengeance
he
was
muttering
in
return
what
business
have
here
sir
was
his
first
intelligible
question
i
need
not
ask
the
same
of
you
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
business
i
can
tell
well
enough
ha
ha
ha
i
ask
you
sir
he
repeated
in
a
still
angrier
tone
what
your
business
here
i
did
not
come
here
on
monsieur
said
i
still
keeping
up
the
tone
of
levity
i
did
not
come
here
on
business
more
than
the
emphasis
on
the
last
words
seemed
to
render
him
furious
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
then
he
shouted
with
a
bullying
frown
for
whom
i
inquired
for
yourself
sir
was
the
reply
i
had
now
also
lost
temper
though
not
altogether
command
of
myself
monsieur
said
i
advancing
and
confronting
him
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
the
house
of
mademoiselle
besancon
is
the
property
of
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
if
it
were
so
i
would
be
less
disposed
to
respect
the
sanctity
of
its
roof
you
sir
have
not
respected
it
you
have
acted
infamously
towards
this
young
girl
this
young
for
she
merits
the
title
as
much
as
the
best
blood
in
your
land
i
have
witnessed
your
dastardly
conduct
and
heard
your
insulting
proposals
here
gayarre
started
but
said
nothing
i
continued
you
are
not
a
gentleman
sir
and
therefore
not
worthy
to
stand
before
my
pistol
the
owner
of
this
house
is
not
at
home
at
present
it
is
as
much
mine
as
yours
and
i
promise
you
that
if
you
are
not
out
of
it
in
ten
seconds
you
shall
have
my
whip
laid
with
severity
upon
your
shoulders
i
said
all
this
in
a
tone
sufficiently
moderate
and
in
cool
blood
gayarre
must
have
seen
that
i
meant
it
for
i
mean
it
you
shall
pay
dearly
for
this
he
hissed
out
you
shall
find
that
this
is
not
the
country
for
a
go
sir
and
you
my
fine
pattern
of
quadroon
virtue
he
added
bending
a
malicious
glance
upon
aurore
there
may
come
a
day
when
you
be
less
prudish
a
day
when
you
not
find
such
a
gallant
protector
another
word
and
the
uplifted
whip
would
have
fallen
on
his
shoulders
he
did
not
wait
for
that
but
gliding
through
the
door
shuffled
off
over
the
verandah
i
stopped
outside
to
make
sure
that
he
was
gone
advancing
to
the
end
of
the
platform
i
looked
over
the
paling
the
chattering
of
the
birds
told
me
that
some
one
was
passing
through
the
shrubbery
i
watched
till
i
saw
the
gate
open
i
could
just
distinguish
a
head
above
the
palings
moving
along
the
road
i
easily
recognised
it
as
that
of
the
disappointed
seducer
as
i
turned
back
towards
the
i
forgot
that
such
a
creature
existed
chapter
twenty
five
an
hour
of
bliss
sweet
is
gratitude
under
any
circumstances
how
much
sweeter
when
expressed
in
the
eyes
and
uttered
by
the
lips
of
those
we
love
i
the
room
my
heart
swelling
with
delightful
emotions
gratitude
was
poured
forth
in
lavish
yet
graceful
expressions
before
i
could
utter
a
word
or
stretch
out
a
hand
to
hinder
the
beautiful
girl
had
glided
across
the
room
and
fallen
into
a
kneeling
posture
at
my
feet
her
thanks
came
from
her
heart
rise
lovely
aurore
said
i
taking
her
unresisting
hand
and
leading
her
to
a
seat
what
i
have
done
is
scarce
worth
thanks
like
thine
who
would
have
acted
otherwise
ah
monsieur
many
many
you
know
not
this
land
there
are
few
to
protect
the
poor
slave
the
chivalry
so
much
boasted
here
extends
not
to
we
in
whose
veins
runs
the
accursed
blood
are
beyond
the
pale
both
of
honour
and
protection
ah
me
noble
stranger
you
know
not
for
how
much
i
am
your
debtor
call
me
not
aurore
it
is
true
we
have
had
but
slight
opportunity
of
conversing
but
our
acquaintance
is
old
enough
to
render
that
title
no
longer
applicable
i
would
you
would
speak
to
me
by
one
more
endearing
monsieur
i
do
not
understand
you
her
large
brown
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
in
a
gaze
of
wonder
but
they
also
interrogated
me
yes
endearing
i
mean
aurore
that
you
will
not
shun
me
that
you
will
give
me
your
confidence
that
you
will
regard
me
as
a
friend
a
a
brother
you
monsieur
you
as
my
brother
a
white
a
gentleman
and
educated
i
i
oh
heavens
what
am
i
a
slave
a
slave
whom
men
love
only
to
o
god
why
is
my
destiny
so
hard
o
god
aurore
i
cried
gathering
courage
from
her
agony
aurore
listen
to
me
to
me
your
friend
your
she
removed
her
hands
that
had
been
clasped
across
her
face
and
looked
up
her
swimming
eyes
were
bent
steadfastly
upon
mine
and
regarded
me
with
a
look
of
interrogation
at
that
moment
a
train
of
thought
crossed
my
mind
in
words
it
was
thus
how
long
may
we
be
alone
we
may
be
interrupted
so
fair
an
opportunity
may
not
offer
again
there
is
no
time
to
waste
in
idle
converse
i
must
at
once
to
the
object
of
my
visit
aurore
i
said
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
met
alone
i
have
longed
for
this
interview
i
have
a
word
that
can
only
be
spoken
to
you
alone
to
me
alone
monsieur
what
is
it
i
love
love
oh
monsieur
it
is
not
possible
ah
more
than
possible
it
is
listen
aurore
from
the
first
hour
i
beheld
you
i
might
almost
say
before
that
hour
for
you
were
in
my
heart
before
i
was
conscious
of
having
seen
you
from
that
first
hour
i
loved
you
not
with
a
villain
love
such
as
you
have
this
moment
spurned
but
with
a
pure
and
honest
passion
and
passion
i
may
well
call
it
for
it
absorbs
every
other
feeling
of
my
soul
morning
and
night
aurore
i
think
but
of
you
you
are
in
my
dreams
and
equally
the
companion
of
my
waking
hours
do
not
fancy
my
love
so
calm
because
i
am
now
speaking
so
calmly
about
it
circumstances
render
me
so
i
have
approached
you
with
a
determined
purpose
one
long
resolved
upon
and
that
perhaps
gives
me
this
firmness
in
declaring
my
love
i
have
said
aurore
that
i
love
you
i
repeat
it
again
my
heart
and
soul
i
love
love
poor
girl
there
was
something
so
ambiguous
in
the
utterance
of
the
last
phrase
that
i
paused
a
moment
in
my
reply
it
seemed
as
though
the
sympathetic
interjection
had
been
meant
for
some
third
person
rather
than
herself
aurore
i
continued
after
a
pause
i
have
told
you
all
i
have
been
candid
i
only
ask
equal
candour
in
return
you
love
i
should
have
put
this
question
less
calmly
but
that
i
felt
already
of
the
answer
we
were
seated
on
the
sofa
and
near
each
other
before
i
had
finished
speaking
i
felt
her
soft
fingers
touch
mine
close
upon
them
and
press
them
gently
together
when
the
question
was
delivered
her
head
fell
forward
on
my
breast
and
i
heard
murmuring
from
her
lips
the
simple
words
too
from
the
first
my
arms
hitherto
restrained
were
now
twined
around
the
yielding
form
and
for
some
moments
neither
uttered
a
word
love
paroxysm
is
best
enjoyed
in
silence
the
wild
intoxicating
kiss
the
deep
mutual
glance
the
pressure
of
hands
and
arms
and
burning
lips
all
these
need
no
tongue
to
make
them
intelligible
for
long
moments
ejaculations
of
delight
phrases
of
tender
endearment
were
the
only
words
that
escaped
us
we
were
too
happy
to
converse
our
lips
paid
respect
to
the
solemnity
of
our
hearts
it
was
neither
the
place
nor
time
for
love
to
go
blind
and
prudence
soon
recalled
me
to
myself
there
was
still
much
to
be
said
and
many
plans
to
be
discussed
before
our
happiness
should
be
secured
to
us
both
were
aware
of
the
abyss
that
still
yawned
between
us
both
were
aware
that
a
thorny
path
must
be
trodden
before
we
could
reach
the
elysium
of
our
hopes
notwithstanding
our
present
bliss
the
future
was
dark
and
dangerous
and
the
thought
of
this
soon
startled
us
from
our
short
sweet
dream
aurora
had
no
longer
any
of
my
love
she
did
not
even
wrong
me
with
suspicion
she
doubted
not
my
purpose
to
make
her
my
love
and
gratitude
stifled
every
doubt
and
we
now
conversed
with
a
mutual
confidence
which
years
of
friendship
could
scarce
have
established
but
we
talked
with
hurried
words
we
knew
not
the
moment
we
might
be
interrupted
we
knew
not
when
again
we
might
meet
alone
we
had
need
to
be
brief
i
explained
to
her
my
circumstances
that
in
a
few
days
i
expected
a
sum
of
money
enough
i
believed
for
the
purpose
what
purpose
purchase
of
my
then
added
i
nothing
remains
but
to
get
married
aurore
alas
replied
she
with
a
sigh
even
were
i
free
we
could
not
be
married
is
it
not
a
wicked
law
that
persecutes
us
even
when
pretending
to
give
us
freedom
i
assented
we
could
not
get
married
she
continued
evidently
suffering
under
painful
emotion
we
could
not
unless
you
could
swear
there
was
african
blood
in
your
veins
only
think
of
such
a
law
in
a
christian
land
think
of
it
aurore
said
i
wishing
to
cheer
her
there
shall
be
no
difficulty
about
swearing
that
i
shall
take
this
gold
pin
from
your
hair
open
this
beautiful
blue
vein
in
your
arm
drink
from
it
and
take
the
oath
the
quadroon
smiled
but
the
moment
after
her
look
of
sadness
returned
come
dearest
aurore
chase
away
such
thoughts
what
care
we
to
be
married
here
we
shall
go
elsewhere
there
are
lands
as
fair
as
louisiana
and
churches
as
fine
as
saint
gabriel
to
be
married
in
we
shall
go
northward
to
england
to
france
anywhere
let
not
that
grieve
you
it
is
not
that
which
grieves
me
what
then
dearest
oh
it
is
i
fear
tear
not
to
tell
me
that
you
will
not
be
able
declare
it
aurore
to
become
buy
here
the
poor
girl
hung
her
head
as
if
ashamed
to
speak
of
such
conditions
i
saw
the
hot
tears
springing
from
her
eyes
and
why
do
you
fear
i
inquired
others
have
tried
large
sums
they
offered
larger
even
than
that
you
have
named
and
they
could
not
they
failed
in
their
intentions
and
oh
how
grateful
was
i
to
mademoiselle
that
was
my
only
protection
she
would
not
part
with
me
how
glad
was
i
then
but
now
now
how
different
the
very
opposite
but
i
shall
give
more
my
whole
fortune
surely
that
will
suffice
the
offers
you
speak
of
were
infamous
proposals
like
that
of
monsieur
gayarre
mademoiselle
knew
it
she
was
too
good
to
accept
them
that
is
true
but
she
will
equally
refuse
yours
i
fear
it
alas
alas
nay
i
shall
confess
all
to
mademoiselle
i
shall
declare
to
her
my
honourable
design
i
shall
implore
her
consent
surely
she
will
not
refuse
surely
she
feels
gratitude
oh
monsieur
cried
aurore
interrupting
me
she
grateful
you
know
not
how
grateful
but
never
never
will
she
you
know
not
all
alas
alas
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
filling
her
eyes
the
beautiful
girl
sank
down
on
the
sofa
hiding
her
face
under
the
folds
of
her
luxuriant
hair
i
was
puzzled
by
these
expressions
and
about
to
ask
for
an
explanation
when
the
noise
of
fell
upon
my
ear
i
sprang
forward
to
the
open
window
and
looked
over
the
tops
of
the
i
could
just
see
the
head
of
a
man
whom
i
recognised
as
the
coachman
of
mademoiselle
besancon
the
carriage
was
approaching
the
gate
in
the
then
tumult
of
my
feelings
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
meet
the
lady
and
bidding
a
hurried
adieu
to
aurore
i
rushed
from
the
apartment
when
outside
i
saw
that
if
i
went
by
the
front
gate
i
should
risk
an
encounter
i
knew
there
was
a
small
that
led
to
the
stables
and
a
road
ran
thence
to
the
woods
this
would
carry
me
to
bringiers
by
a
back
way
and
stepping
off
from
the
verandah
i
passed
through
the
wicket
and
directed
myself
towards
the
stables
in
the
rear
chapter
twenty
six
the
nigger
quarter
i
soon
reached
the
stables
where
i
was
welcomed
by
a
low
whimper
from
my
horse
scipio
was
not
there
he
is
gone
upon
some
other
business
thought
i
perhaps
to
meet
the
carriage
no
matter
i
shall
not
summon
him
the
saddle
is
on
and
i
can
bridle
the
steed
myself
only
poor
scipio
loses
his
i
soon
had
my
steed
bitted
and
bridled
and
leading
the
animal
outside
i
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
rode
off
the
path
i
was
taking
led
past
the
negro
quarters
and
then
through
some
fields
to
the
dark
cypress
and
tupelo
woods
in
the
rear
from
these
led
a
that
would
bring
me
out
again
upon
the
levee
road
i
had
travelled
this
path
many
a
time
and
knew
it
well
enough
the
nigger
quarter
was
distant
some
two
hundred
yards
from
the
grande
maison
or
big
house
of
the
plantation
it
consisted
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
little
cabins
neatly
built
and
standing
in
a
double
row
with
a
broad
way
between
each
cabin
was
a
facsimile
of
its
neighbour
and
in
front
of
each
grew
a
magnolia
or
a
beautiful
under
the
shade
of
whose
green
leaves
and
flowers
little
negroes
might
be
seen
all
the
livelong
day
disporting
their
bodies
in
the
dust
these
of
all
sizes
from
the
piccaninny
to
the
chunk
of
a
boy
and
of
every
shade
of
from
the
quadroon
to
the
black
bambarra
on
whom
by
an
american
witticism
of
doubtful
truthfulness
charcoal
would
make
a
white
mark
divesting
them
of
dust
you
would
have
no
difficulty
in
determining
their
complexion
their
little
plump
bodies
were
nude
from
the
top
of
their
woolly
heads
to
their
long
projecting
heels
there
roll
they
black
and
yellow
urchins
all
the
day
playing
with
pieces
of
or
or
cheerful
and
happy
as
any
little
lords
could
be
in
their
nurseries
in
the
midst
of
the
costliest
toys
of
the
german
bazaar
on
entering
the
negro
quarter
you
can
not
fail
to
observe
tall
papaw
poles
or
stuck
up
in
front
of
many
of
the
cabins
and
carrying
upon
their
tops
large
yellow
each
perforated
with
a
hole
in
the
side
these
are
the
dwellings
of
the
purple
martin
the
most
beautiful
of
american
swallows
and
a
great
favourite
among
the
simple
negroes
as
it
had
been
long
before
their
time
among
the
red
aborigines
of
the
soil
you
will
notice
too
hanging
in
festoons
along
the
walls
of
the
cabins
strings
of
red
and
green
species
of
capsicum
and
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
some
dried
herb
of
medicinal
virtue
belonging
to
the
negro
all
these
are
the
property
of
aunt
phoebe
or
aunty
cleopatra
or
ole
aunt
phillis
and
the
delicious
pepper
pot
that
any
one
of
those
aunts
can
make
out
of
the
aforesaid
green
and
red
capsicums
assisted
by
a
few
other
ingredients
from
the
little
garden
patch
in
the
rear
of
the
cabin
would
bring
water
to
the
teeth
of
an
epicure
perhaps
on
the
cabin
walls
you
will
see
suspended
representatives
of
the
animal
kingdom
perhaps
the
skin
of
a
rabbit
a
raccoon
an
opossum
or
the
grey
fox
perhaps
also
that
of
the
or
rarer
still
the
swamp
bay
lynx
the
owner
of
the
cabin
upon
which
hangs
the
will
be
the
nimrod
of
the
hour
for
the
cat
is
among
the
rarest
and
noblest
game
of
the
mississippi
the
skin
of
the
panther
or
deer
you
will
not
see
for
although
both
inhabit
the
neighbouring
forest
they
are
too
high
game
for
the
negro
hunter
who
is
not
permitted
the
use
of
a
gun
the
smaller
varmints
already
enumerated
can
be
captured
without
such
aid
and
the
pelts
you
see
hanging
upon
the
cabins
are
the
produce
of
many
a
moonlight
hunt
undertaken
by
caesar
or
scipio
or
hannibal
or
pompey
judging
by
the
nomenclature
of
the
negro
quarter
you
might
fancy
yourself
in
ancient
rome
or
carthage
the
great
men
however
are
never
trusted
with
such
a
dangerous
weapon
as
a
rifle
to
their
alone
do
they
owe
their
success
in
the
chase
and
their
weapons
are
only
a
stick
an
axe
and
a
of
mongrel
race
several
of
these
last
you
may
see
rolling
about
in
the
dust
among
the
piccaninnies
and
apparently
as
happy
as
they
but
the
hunting
trophies
that
adorn
the
walls
do
not
hang
there
as
mere
ornaments
no
they
are
spread
out
to
dry
and
will
soon
give
place
to
others
for
there
is
a
constant
export
going
on
when
uncle
ceez
or
zip
or
hanny
or
pomp
get
on
their
sunday
finery
and
repair
to
the
village
each
carries
with
him
his
stock
of
small
pelts
there
the
storekeeper
has
a
talk
with
them
and
a
pic
picayune
for
the
mussrat
a
bit
spanish
real
for
the
and
a
quarter
for
the
fox
or
cat
enable
these
four
avuncular
hunters
to
lay
in
a
great
variety
of
small
luxuries
for
the
four
aunties
at
home
which
little
comforts
are
most
likely
excluded
from
the
regular
rations
of
the
plantation
so
much
is
a
little
bit
of
the
domestic
economy
of
the
negro
quarter
on
entering
the
little
village
for
the
negro
quarter
of
a
grand
plantation
merits
the
title
you
can
not
fail
to
observe
all
of
these
little
matters
they
are
the
salient
points
of
the
picture
you
will
observe
too
the
house
of
the
overseer
standing
apart
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
plantation
besancon
at
the
end
of
the
double
row
and
fronting
the
main
avenue
this
of
course
is
of
a
more
pretentious
style
of
architecture
can
boast
of
venetian
blinds
to
the
windows
two
stories
of
height
and
a
porch
it
is
enclosed
with
a
paling
to
keep
off
the
intrusion
of
the
children
but
the
dread
of
the
painted
cowhide
renders
the
paling
almost
superfluous
as
i
approached
the
quarter
i
was
struck
with
the
peculiar
character
of
the
picture
it
presented
the
overseer
house
towering
above
the
humbler
cabins
seeming
to
protect
and
watch
over
them
suggesting
the
similarity
of
a
hen
with
her
brood
of
chickens
here
and
there
the
great
purple
swallows
boldly
cleft
the
air
or
poised
on
wing
by
the
entrance
of
their
dwellings
uttered
their
cheerful
tweet
tweet
tweet
while
the
fragrant
odour
of
the
and
magnolias
scented
the
atmosphere
to
a
long
distance
around
when
nearer
still
i
could
distinguish
the
hum
of
human
voices
of
men
women
and
children
in
that
peculiar
tone
which
characterises
the
voice
of
the
african
i
fancied
the
little
community
as
i
had
before
seen
it
the
men
and
women
engaged
in
various
occupations
some
resting
from
their
labour
for
it
was
now
after
field
hours
seated
in
front
of
their
cabins
under
the
or
standing
in
little
groups
gaily
chatting
with
each
other
some
by
the
door
mending
their
and
tackle
by
which
they
intended
to
capture
the
great
cat
and
buffalo
fish
of
the
bayous
some
chopping
firewood
at
the
common
which
urchins
were
toating
to
the
cabins
so
that
aunty
might
prepare
the
i
was
musing
on
the
patriarchal
character
of
such
a
picture
towards
the
power
if
not
in
the
shape
of
a
slaveholder
yet
something
after
the
style
of
rapp
and
his
social
economists
what
a
saving
of
state
machinery
soliloquised
i
in
this
patriarchal
form
how
charmingly
simple
and
yet
how
complete
and
efficient
just
so
but
i
had
overlooked
one
thing
and
that
was
the
imperfectness
of
human
nature
the
possibility
the
probability
nay
the
almost
certainty
that
the
will
pass
into
the
hark
a
voice
louder
than
common
it
is
a
cry
of
cheerful
import
no
on
the
contrary
it
sounds
like
the
utterance
of
some
one
in
pain
it
is
a
cry
of
agony
the
murmur
of
other
voices
too
heard
at
short
intervals
carries
to
my
ear
that
deep
portentous
sound
which
accompanies
some
unnatural
occurrence
again
i
hear
the
cry
of
agony
deeper
and
louder
than
before
it
comes
from
the
direction
of
the
negro
quarter
what
is
causing
it
i
gave
the
spur
to
my
horse
and
galloped
in
the
direction
of
the
cabins
chapter
twenty
seven
the
devil
douche
in
a
few
seconds
i
entered
the
wide
avenue
between
the
cabins
and
drawing
bridle
sat
glancing
around
me
my
patriarchal
dreams
vanished
at
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
before
me
was
a
scene
of
tyranny
of
torture
a
scene
from
the
tragedy
of
at
the
upper
end
of
the
quarter
and
on
one
side
of
the
house
was
an
enclosure
it
was
the
enclosure
of
the
a
large
building
which
stood
a
little
further
back
inside
the
fence
was
a
tall
pump
rising
full
ten
feet
in
height
with
the
spout
near
its
top
the
purpose
of
this
pump
was
to
yield
a
stream
of
water
which
was
conducted
to
the
by
means
of
a
slender
trough
that
served
as
an
aqueduct
a
platform
was
raised
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
so
as
to
enable
the
person
working
the
pump
to
reach
its
handle
to
this
spot
my
attention
was
directed
by
seeing
that
the
negroes
of
the
quarter
were
grouped
around
it
while
the
women
and
children
clinging
along
the
fence
had
their
eyes
bent
in
the
same
direction
the
faces
of
all
men
women
and
children
wore
an
ominous
and
gloomy
expression
and
the
attitudes
in
which
they
stood
betokened
terror
and
alarm
murmurs
i
could
hear
now
and
then
ejaculations
and
sobs
that
bespoke
sympathy
with
some
one
who
suffered
i
saw
scowling
brows
as
if
knit
by
thoughts
of
vengeance
but
these
last
were
few
the
more
general
expression
was
one
of
terror
and
submission
it
was
not
difficult
to
tell
that
the
cry
i
had
heard
proceeded
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pump
and
a
glance
unfolded
the
cause
some
poor
slave
was
undergoing
punishment
a
group
of
negroes
hid
the
unfortunate
from
my
view
but
over
their
heads
i
could
see
the
slave
gabriel
his
body
naked
to
the
breech
mounted
upon
the
platform
and
working
the
pump
with
all
his
might
this
gabriel
was
a
bambarra
negro
of
huge
size
and
strength
branded
on
both
shoulders
with
the
he
was
a
man
of
fierce
aspect
and
as
i
had
heard
of
fierce
and
brutal
habit
feared
not
only
by
the
other
negroes
but
by
the
whites
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
it
was
not
he
that
was
undergoing
punishment
on
the
contrary
he
was
the
instrument
of
torture
and
torture
it
was
i
knew
the
punishment
well
the
trough
or
aqueduct
had
been
removed
and
the
victim
was
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
pump
directly
under
the
spout
he
was
fast
bound
in
a
species
of
stocks
and
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
not
move
his
head
which
the
continuous
jet
in
the
very
centre
of
the
torture
no
doubt
you
are
incredulous
you
fancy
there
can
be
no
great
torture
in
that
a
simple
shock
a
nothing
more
you
are
right
for
the
first
or
so
it
is
but
a
shock
a
but
then
believe
me
when
i
declare
to
you
that
a
stream
of
molten
lead
an
axe
continually
crashing
through
the
skull
would
not
be
more
painful
than
the
falling
of
this
jet
it
is
torture
beyond
endurance
agony
indescribable
well
may
it
be
called
the
devil
douche
again
the
agonised
cry
came
from
the
pump
almost
curdling
my
blood
as
i
have
said
i
could
not
see
the
sufferer
at
first
a
row
of
bodies
was
interposed
between
him
and
me
the
negroes
however
seeing
me
ride
up
eagerly
opened
their
ranks
and
fell
back
a
pace
as
if
desiring
i
should
be
a
witness
to
what
was
going
forward
they
all
knew
me
and
all
had
some
impression
that
i
with
their
unfortunate
race
this
opening
gave
me
a
full
view
of
the
horrid
spectacle
disclosing
a
group
that
made
me
start
in
the
saddle
under
the
torture
was
the
victim
a
man
of
sable
hue
close
by
him
a
large
mulatto
woman
and
a
young
girl
of
the
same
complexion
mother
and
daughter
stood
folded
in
each
other
arms
both
weeping
bitterly
i
could
hear
their
sobs
and
ejaculations
even
at
the
distance
of
a
score
of
yards
and
above
the
plashing
sound
of
the
falling
water
i
recognised
at
a
glance
who
these
were
they
were
the
little
chloe
and
her
mother
quick
as
lightning
my
eyes
were
directed
towards
the
sufferer
the
water
as
it
bounded
from
his
crown
spread
into
a
glassy
sheet
that
completely
concealed
his
head
but
the
huge
projecting
ears
told
me
who
was
the
victim
it
was
scipio
again
his
cry
of
agony
pealed
upon
my
ears
deep
and
prolonged
as
though
it
issued
from
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
soul
i
did
not
wait
till
that
cry
was
ended
a
fence
of
six
rails
separated
me
from
the
sufferer
but
what
of
that
i
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
but
winding
my
horse
round
to
give
him
the
run
i
headed
him
at
the
leap
and
with
a
touch
of
the
spur
lifted
him
into
the
inclosure
i
did
not
even
stay
to
dismount
but
galloping
up
to
the
platform
laid
my
whip
across
the
naked
shoulders
of
the
bambarra
with
all
the
force
that
lay
in
my
arm
the
astonished
savage
dropped
the
as
if
it
had
been
iron
at
a
white
heat
and
leaping
from
the
platform
ran
off
howling
to
his
cabin
exclamations
and
loud
murmurings
of
applause
followed
but
my
horse
brought
so
suddenly
to
this
exciting
work
snorted
and
plunged
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
quiet
him
while
thus
engaged
i
observed
that
the
exclamations
were
suddenly
discontinued
and
the
murmurs
of
applause
were
succeeded
by
a
dead
ominous
silence
i
could
hear
several
of
the
negroes
nearest
me
muttering
some
words
of
caution
as
though
meant
for
me
among
others
the
cry
of
de
oberseer
de
oberseer
look
out
dar
he
kum
at
that
moment
an
abominable
oath
uttered
in
a
loud
voice
reached
my
ears
i
looked
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
as
i
anticipated
it
was
the
overseer
he
was
just
issuing
from
the
of
his
house
from
a
window
of
which
he
had
been
all
the
while
a
spectator
of
scipio
torture
i
had
not
come
in
contact
with
this
person
before
and
i
now
saw
approaching
a
man
of
fierce
and
brutal
aspect
somewhat
flashily
dressed
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
thick
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
livid
with
rage
and
that
he
was
directing
himself
to
attack
me
i
had
no
weapon
but
my
and
with
this
i
prepared
to
receive
his
assault
he
came
on
at
a
run
all
the
while
venting
the
most
diabolical
curses
when
he
had
got
nearly
up
to
my
horse
head
he
stopped
a
moment
and
thundered
out
who
the
hell
are
you
meddling
with
my
affairs
who
the
damn
are
he
suddenly
paused
in
his
speech
and
stood
staring
in
astonishment
i
reciprocated
that
astonishment
for
i
had
now
recognised
in
the
brutal
overseer
my
antagonist
of
the
boat
the
hero
of
the
at
the
same
instant
he
recognised
me
the
pause
which
was
the
result
of
our
mutual
surprise
lasted
but
a
moment
hell
and
furies
cried
the
ruffian
changing
his
former
tone
only
into
one
more
horribly
furious
it
is
it
whip
be
damned
i
something
else
for
and
as
he
said
this
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
coat
and
hastily
cocking
it
aimed
it
at
my
breast
i
was
still
on
horseback
and
in
motion
else
he
would
no
doubt
have
delivered
his
fire
at
once
but
my
horse
reared
up
at
the
gleam
of
the
pistol
and
his
body
was
thus
interposed
between
mine
and
its
muzzle
as
i
have
said
i
had
no
weapon
but
the
whip
fortunately
it
was
a
stout
with
loaded
butt
i
hastily
turned
it
in
my
hand
and
just
as
the
hoofs
of
my
horse
came
back
to
the
earth
i
drove
the
spur
so
deeply
into
his
ribs
that
he
sprang
forward
more
than
his
own
length
this
placed
me
in
the
very
spot
i
wanted
to
be
alongside
my
ruffian
antagonist
who
taken
aback
by
my
sudden
change
of
position
hesitated
a
moment
before
taking
fresh
aim
before
he
could
pull
trigger
the
butt
of
my
whip
descended
upon
his
skull
and
doubled
him
up
in
the
dust
his
pistol
went
off
as
he
fell
and
the
bullet
ploughed
up
the
ground
between
my
horse
hoofs
but
fortunately
hit
no
one
the
weapon
itself
new
out
of
his
hand
and
lay
beside
him
where
he
had
fallen
it
was
a
mere
lucky
hit
all
owing
to
the
spur
being
touched
and
my
horse
having
sprung
forward
in
good
time
had
i
missed
the
blow
i
should
not
likely
have
had
a
second
chance
the
pistol
was
and
on
examination
i
found
he
carried
another
of
a
similar
kind
he
was
now
lying
as
still
as
if
asleep
and
i
began
to
fear
i
had
killed
him
this
would
have
been
a
serious
matter
although
perfectly
justifiable
in
me
to
have
done
so
who
was
to
show
that
the
evidence
of
those
around
me
the
whole
of
them
together
was
not
worth
the
asseveration
of
one
white
man
and
under
the
circumstances
not
worth
a
straw
indeed
considering
what
had
immediately
led
to
the
rencontre
such
testimony
would
have
been
more
likely
to
my
case
than
otherwise
i
felt
myself
in
an
awkward
situation
i
now
dismounted
and
approached
the
prostrate
form
around
which
the
blacks
were
congregating
they
made
way
for
me
i
knelt
down
and
examined
the
head
it
was
cut
and
bleeding
but
the
skull
was
still
sound
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
set
my
mind
at
rest
and
before
i
rose
to
my
feet
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
that
the
fellow
was
coming
to
his
senses
under
the
influence
of
a
douche
of
the
butt
of
the
second
pistol
came
under
my
eye
as
it
stuck
out
from
the
breast
of
his
coat
i
drew
it
forth
and
along
with
its
fellow
took
them
into
my
own
keeping
tell
him
said
i
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
himself
that
when
he
next
attacks
me
i
shall
have
pistols
as
well
as
he
having
ordered
him
to
be
carried
into
the
house
i
now
turned
my
attention
to
his
victim
poor
scipio
he
had
been
most
cruelly
tortured
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
recovered
his
faculties
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
me
why
he
had
been
thus
punished
the
relation
he
at
length
gave
and
it
made
the
blood
boil
afresh
within
my
veins
he
had
surprised
the
overseer
in
some
of
the
outbuildings
with
little
chloe
in
his
arms
the
child
crying
out
and
struggling
to
get
free
natural
indignation
on
the
part
of
the
father
led
to
a
blow
an
offence
for
which
scipio
might
have
lost
an
arm
but
the
white
wretch
knowing
that
he
dare
not
for
his
own
sake
expose
the
motive
had
commuted
scipio
legal
punishment
to
a
little
private
torture
under
the
pump
my
first
impulse
on
hearing
this
sad
story
was
to
return
to
the
house
report
what
had
occurred
to
mademoiselle
and
urge
upon
her
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
this
savage
overseer
at
all
risk
after
a
little
reflection
i
changed
my
mind
i
purposed
to
return
upon
the
morrow
on
business
of
to
me
much
greater
importance
it
was
my
intention
to
for
i
can
then
thought
i
introduce
the
case
of
poor
scipio
perhaps
it
may
be
an
introduction
to
the
theme
having
promised
this
much
to
my
old
attendant
i
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
off
amidst
a
shower
of
blessings
as
i
passed
through
the
avenue
at
a
walk
women
and
girls
hurried
from
their
doors
and
kissed
my
feet
as
they
hung
in
the
stirrups
the
burning
love
which
so
late
filled
my
heart
was
for
a
moment
unfelt
its
place
was
occupied
by
a
calm
sweet
happiness
the
happiness
that
springs
from
benefaction
chapter
twenty
eight
gayarre
and
bully
bill
on
riding
out
from
the
quarter
i
changed
my
intention
of
taking
the
back
road
my
visit
would
no
doubt
become
known
to
mademoiselle
and
it
differed
not
if
i
should
now
be
seen
from
the
house
my
blood
was
up
so
was
that
of
my
horse
a
was
nothing
to
either
of
us
now
so
heading
round
i
cleared
a
couple
of
palings
and
then
striking
across
a
arrived
once
more
on
the
levee
road
after
a
while
as
soon
as
i
had
cooled
down
my
horse
i
rode
slowly
reflecting
upon
what
had
just
happened
it
was
evident
that
this
ruffian
had
been
put
upon
the
plantation
by
gayarre
for
some
secret
purpose
whether
he
and
the
lawyer
had
had
previous
acquaintance
i
could
not
guess
but
such
men
have
a
sort
of
instinctive
knowledge
of
one
another
and
he
might
be
only
a
waif
that
the
latter
had
picked
up
since
the
night
of
the
wreck
on
the
boat
i
had
supposed
him
to
be
some
rough
gambler
by
the
propensity
he
exhibited
for
betting
and
possibly
he
might
have
been
playing
that
of
late
it
was
evident
however
that
was
his
trade
at
all
events
it
was
not
new
to
him
strange
that
he
had
been
all
this
time
on
the
plantation
without
knowing
of
me
but
that
could
be
easily
accounted
for
he
had
never
seen
me
during
my
stay
at
the
house
moreover
he
may
have
been
ignorant
that
mademoiselle
was
the
lady
with
whom
he
intended
to
have
shared
the
this
last
hypothesis
was
probable
enough
for
there
were
other
ladies
who
escaped
by
means
of
rafts
and
sofas
and
i
fancied
he
had
not
seen
mademoiselle
until
she
was
springing
over
the
guards
and
would
therefore
scarce
recognise
her
again
the
cause
of
my
being
an
invalid
was
only
known
to
mademoiselle
aurore
and
scipio
and
the
latter
had
been
charged
not
to
carry
this
knowledge
to
the
negro
quarter
then
the
fellow
was
but
new
on
the
plantation
and
had
but
little
intercourse
with
its
mistress
as
he
received
most
of
his
orders
from
gayarre
besides
he
was
but
a
dull
brute
after
all
it
was
just
like
enough
that
up
to
the
moment
of
our
late
encounter
he
had
no
suspicion
either
that
i
was
his
former
antagonist
on
the
boat
or
eugenie
besancon
the
lady
who
had
escaped
him
he
must
have
known
of
my
presence
on
the
plantation
but
only
as
one
of
the
survivors
of
the
wreck
badly
wounded
scalded
perhaps
but
there
had
been
a
number
of
others
picked
up
scarce
a
house
for
some
distance
along
the
coast
but
had
given
shelter
to
some
wounded
or
unfortunate
he
had
been
busy
with
his
own
affairs
or
rather
perhaps
those
of
gayarre
for
i
had
no
doubt
there
was
some
conspiracy
between
them
in
which
this
fellow
was
to
play
a
part
dull
as
he
was
he
had
something
which
his
employer
might
regard
of
more
value
than
intellect
something
too
which
the
latter
himself
lacked
brute
strength
and
brute
courage
gayarre
no
doubt
had
a
use
for
him
else
he
would
not
have
been
there
he
knew
me
now
and
was
not
likely
soon
to
forget
me
would
he
seek
revenge
beyond
doubt
he
would
but
i
fancied
it
would
be
by
some
base
underhand
means
i
had
no
fear
that
he
would
again
attack
me
openly
at
least
by
himself
i
felt
quite
sure
that
i
had
conquered
and
encowardiced
him
i
had
encountered
his
like
before
i
know
that
his
courage
was
not
of
that
character
to
outlive
defeat
it
was
the
courage
of
the
bravo
i
had
no
fear
of
an
open
attack
all
i
had
to
apprehend
was
some
secret
revenge
or
perhaps
the
law
you
will
wonder
that
any
thought
or
dread
of
the
latter
should
have
occurred
to
me
but
it
did
and
i
had
my
reasons
the
knowledge
of
gayarre
designs
the
detection
of
his
villainous
purpose
with
aurore
and
my
rencontre
with
larkin
had
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
i
was
filled
with
anxiety
and
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
interview
with
mademoiselle
in
relation
to
what
was
nearest
to
my
heart
purchase
of
the
there
was
no
reason
why
a
single
hour
should
be
wasted
now
that
aurore
and
i
understood
each
other
and
had
in
fact
ourselves
i
even
thought
of
riding
back
at
once
and
had
turned
my
horse
for
the
purpose
i
hesitated
my
resolution
wavered
i
wheeled
round
again
and
kept
on
to
bringiers
with
the
determination
to
return
to
the
plantation
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
i
entered
the
village
and
proceeded
straight
to
the
hotel
on
my
table
i
found
a
letter
containing
a
cheque
for
two
hundred
pounds
on
the
bringiers
bank
it
was
from
my
banking
agent
in
new
orleans
who
had
received
it
from
england
the
letter
also
contained
the
information
that
five
hundred
more
would
reach
me
in
a
few
days
the
sum
received
was
a
pleasant
relief
and
would
enable
me
to
discharge
my
pecuniary
obligations
to
reigart
which
in
the
next
hour
i
had
the
pleasure
of
doing
i
passed
a
night
of
great
anxiety
almost
a
sleepless
night
no
wonder
was
to
be
a
crisis
for
me
happiness
or
misery
was
in
the
womb
of
a
thousand
hopes
and
fears
hung
suspended
on
the
result
of
my
interview
with
eugenie
besancon
i
actually
looked
forward
to
this
interview
with
more
anxiety
than
i
had
done
but
a
few
hours
ago
to
that
with
aurore
perhaps
because
i
had
less
confidence
in
a
favourable
result
as
early
as
etiquette
would
allow
of
a
morning
visit
i
was
in
the
saddle
and
heading
towards
the
plantation
besancon
as
i
rode
out
of
the
village
i
noticed
that
men
regarded
me
with
glances
that
bespoke
an
unusual
interest
my
affair
with
the
overseer
is
already
known
thought
i
no
doubt
the
negroes
have
spread
the
report
of
it
such
matters
soon
become
public
i
was
unpleasantly
impressed
with
an
idea
that
the
expression
on
people
faces
was
anything
but
a
friendly
one
had
i
committed
an
unpopular
act
in
protecting
myself
usually
the
conqueror
in
such
an
encounter
is
rather
popular
than
otherwise
in
the
chivalric
land
of
louisiana
why
then
did
men
look
scowling
upon
me
what
had
i
done
to
merit
reproach
i
had
whipped
a
rude
fellow
whom
men
esteemed
a
bully
and
in
had
i
acted
the
act
should
have
gained
me
applause
according
to
the
code
of
the
country
why
then
ha
stay
i
had
interfered
between
and
i
had
a
slave
from
perhaps
that
might
account
for
the
disagreeable
expression
i
had
observed
i
could
just
guess
at
another
cause
of
a
very
different
and
somewhat
ludicrous
character
it
had
got
rumoured
abroad
that
i
was
upon
good
terms
with
mademoiselle
besancon
and
that
it
was
not
unlikely
that
one
of
these
fine
days
the
adventurer
whom
nobody
knew
anything
about
would
carry
off
the
rich
plantress
there
is
no
part
of
the
world
where
such
a
is
not
regarded
with
envy
the
united
states
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
and
i
had
reason
to
know
that
on
account
of
this
absurd
rumour
i
was
not
very
favourably
regarded
by
some
of
the
young
planters
and
dandy
storekeepers
who
loitered
about
the
streets
of
bringiers
i
rode
on
without
heeding
the
black
looks
that
were
cast
upon
me
and
indeed
soon
ceased
thinking
of
them
my
mind
was
too
full
of
anxiety
about
the
approaching
interview
to
be
impressed
with
minor
cares
of
course
eugenie
would
have
heard
all
about
the
affair
of
yesterday
what
would
be
her
feelings
in
relation
to
it
i
felt
certain
that
this
ruffian
was
forced
upon
her
by
gayarre
she
would
have
no
sympathy
with
the
question
was
would
she
have
the
courage
nay
the
to
discharge
him
from
her
service
even
on
hearing
he
was
it
was
doubtful
enough
i
was
overwhelmed
with
sympathy
for
this
poor
girl
i
felt
satisfied
that
gayarre
must
be
her
creditor
to
a
large
amount
and
in
that
way
had
her
in
his
power
what
he
had
said
to
aurore
convinced
me
that
such
was
the
case
indeed
reigart
had
heard
some
whisper
that
his
debt
had
already
been
proved
before
the
courts
in
new
orleans
that
no
opposition
had
been
made
that
he
had
obtained
a
verdict
and
could
seize
upon
her
property
or
as
much
of
it
as
would
satisfy
his
demands
at
any
moment
it
was
only
the
night
before
reigart
had
told
me
this
and
the
information
had
rendered
me
all
the
more
anxious
to
hasten
my
business
in
relation
to
aurore
i
spurred
into
a
gallop
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
plantation
having
arrived
at
the
gate
i
dismounted
there
was
no
one
to
hold
my
horse
but
that
is
a
slight
matter
in
america
where
a
or
a
branch
of
a
tree
often
serves
as
a
groom
bethinking
me
of
this
ready
expedient
i
tossed
my
rein
over
one
of
the
palings
and
walked
toward
the
house
chapter
twenty
nine
elle
it
was
natural
i
should
have
thoughts
about
my
yesterday
antagonist
would
i
encounter
him
not
likely
the
butt
of
my
whip
had
no
doubt
given
him
a
headache
that
would
confine
him
for
some
days
to
his
quarters
but
i
was
prepared
for
any
event
under
my
waistcoat
were
his
own
pistols
which
i
intended
to
use
if
attacked
it
was
my
first
essay
at
carrying
concealed
weapons
but
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
country
at
the
time
a
fashion
followed
by
nineteen
out
of
every
twenty
persons
you
met
by
planters
merchants
lawyers
doctors
and
even
divines
so
prepared
i
had
no
fear
of
an
encounter
with
bully
bill
if
my
pulse
beat
quick
and
my
step
was
nervous
it
was
on
account
of
the
anticipated
interview
with
his
mistress
with
all
the
coolness
i
could
command
i
entered
the
house
i
found
mademoiselle
in
the
she
received
me
without
reserve
or
embarrassment
to
my
surprise
as
well
as
gratification
she
appeared
more
cheerful
than
usual
i
could
even
detect
a
significant
smile
i
fancied
she
was
pleased
at
what
had
occurred
for
of
course
she
was
aware
of
it
all
i
could
understand
this
well
enough
aurore
was
not
present
i
was
glad
she
was
not
i
hoped
she
would
not
come
into
the
room
least
for
a
i
was
embarrassed
i
scarce
knew
how
to
open
the
conversation
much
less
to
break
to
mademoiselle
the
matter
that
was
nearest
my
heart
a
few
ordinary
phrases
passed
between
us
and
then
our
conversation
turned
upon
the
affair
of
yesterday
i
told
her
all
everything
except
the
scene
with
aurore
that
was
omitted
i
hesitated
for
some
time
whether
i
should
let
her
know
her
overseer
was
when
she
should
ascertain
that
he
was
the
fellow
who
had
wounded
me
on
the
boat
and
who
but
for
me
would
have
taken
away
her
chances
of
safety
i
felt
certain
she
would
insist
upon
getting
rid
of
him
at
all
risks
for
a
moment
i
reflected
upon
the
consequences
she
will
never
be
safe
thought
i
with
such
a
ruffian
at
her
side
better
for
her
to
make
stand
at
once
under
this
belief
i
boldly
came
out
with
the
information
she
seemed
astounded
and
clasping
her
hands
remained
for
some
moments
in
an
attitude
of
mute
agony
at
length
she
cried
out
gayarre
gayarre
it
is
you
monsieur
gayarre
oh
dieu
mon
where
is
my
father
where
is
antoine
god
have
mercy
upon
me
the
expression
of
grief
upon
her
lovely
countenance
went
to
my
heart
she
looked
an
angel
of
sorrow
sad
but
beautiful
i
interrupted
her
with
consolatory
phrases
of
the
ordinary
kind
though
i
could
only
guess
the
nature
of
her
sorrow
she
listened
to
me
patiently
and
i
fancied
that
what
i
said
gave
her
pleasure
taking
courage
from
this
i
proceeded
to
inquire
more
particularly
the
cause
of
her
grief
mademoiselle
said
i
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
i
am
taking
but
for
some
time
i
have
observed
or
fancied
that
you
have
a
cause
of
of
unhappiness
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
me
in
a
gaze
of
silent
wonder
i
hesitated
a
moment
under
this
strange
regard
and
then
continued
pardon
me
mademoiselle
if
i
speak
too
boldly
i
assure
you
my
motive
speak
on
monsieur
she
said
in
a
calm
sad
voice
i
noticed
this
the
more
because
when
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
your
manner
was
so
very
different
in
fact
quite
the
reverse
a
sigh
and
a
sad
smile
were
the
only
reply
these
interrupted
me
for
but
a
moment
and
i
proceeded
when
first
observing
this
change
mademoiselle
i
attributed
it
to
grief
for
the
loss
of
your
faithful
servitor
and
friend
another
melancholy
smile
but
the
period
of
sorrowing
for
such
a
cause
is
surely
past
and
yet
and
yet
you
observe
that
i
am
still
sad
just
so
mademoiselle
true
monsieur
it
is
even
so
i
have
ceased
therefore
to
regard
that
as
the
cause
of
your
melancholy
and
have
been
forced
to
think
of
some
other
the
gaze
of
half
surprise
half
interrogation
that
now
met
mine
caused
me
for
a
moment
to
suspend
my
speech
after
a
pause
i
resumed
it
determined
to
come
at
once
to
the
point
you
will
pardon
me
mademoiselle
for
this
free
interest
in
your
affairs
you
will
pardon
me
for
asking
do
i
not
recognise
in
monsieur
gayarre
the
cause
of
your
unhappiness
she
started
at
the
question
and
turned
visibly
paler
in
a
moment
however
she
seemed
to
recover
herself
and
replied
calmly
but
with
a
look
of
strange
significance
helas
monsieur
your
suspicions
are
but
correct
helas
oh
god
support
me
she
added
in
a
tone
that
sounded
like
despair
then
as
if
by
an
effort
her
manner
seemed
to
undergo
a
sudden
alteration
and
she
continued
please
monsieur
let
us
change
the
subject
i
owe
you
life
and
gratitude
would
i
knew
how
to
repay
you
for
your
generous
gallantry
your
your
perhaps
some
day
you
may
know
all
i
would
tell
you
now
but
but
monsieur
there
are
i
can
not
mademoiselle
besancon
i
entreat
you
do
not
for
a
moment
let
the
questions
i
have
asked
have
any
consideration
they
were
not
put
from
idle
curiosity
i
need
not
tell
you
mademoiselle
that
my
motive
was
of
a
higher
kind
i
know
it
monsieur
i
know
it
but
no
more
of
it
now
i
pray
you
let
us
speak
on
some
other
subject
some
other
subject
i
had
no
longer
the
choice
of
one
i
had
no
longer
control
of
my
tongue
the
subject
which
was
nearest
my
heart
sprang
spontaneously
to
my
lips
and
in
hurried
words
i
declared
my
love
for
aurore
i
detailed
the
whole
course
of
my
passion
from
the
hour
of
my
dreamlike
vision
up
to
that
when
we
had
plighted
our
mutual
troth
my
listener
was
seated
upon
the
low
ottoman
directly
before
me
but
from
motives
of
bashfulness
i
had
kept
my
eyes
averted
during
the
time
i
was
speaking
she
heard
me
without
interruption
and
i
augured
well
from
this
silence
i
concluded
at
length
and
with
trembling
heart
was
awaiting
her
reply
when
a
deep
sigh
followed
by
a
rustling
sound
caused
me
suddenly
to
turn
had
fallen
upon
the
with
a
glance
i
saw
she
had
fainted
i
flung
my
arms
around
her
and
carried
her
to
the
sofa
i
was
about
to
call
for
assistance
when
the
door
opened
and
a
form
glided
into
the
room
was
exclaimed
the
latter
faire
mourir
elle
elle
chapter
thirty
thoughts
that
night
i
passed
without
repose
how
was
it
with
eugenie
how
with
aurore
mine
was
a
night
of
reflections
in
which
pleasure
and
pain
were
singularly
blended
the
love
of
the
quadroon
was
my
source
of
pleasure
but
alas
pain
predominated
as
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
creole
that
the
latter
loved
me
i
no
longer
doubted
and
this
assurance
so
far
from
giving
me
joy
filled
me
with
keen
regret
accursed
vanity
that
can
enjoy
such
a
triumph
vile
heart
that
can
revel
in
a
love
it
is
unable
to
return
mine
did
not
it
grieved
instead
in
thought
i
reviewed
the
short
hours
of
intercourse
that
had
passed
between
us
eugenie
besancon
and
myself
i
communed
with
my
conscience
asking
myself
the
question
was
i
innocent
had
i
done
aught
either
by
word
or
look
or
gesture
to
occasion
this
love
to
produce
the
first
delicate
impression
that
upon
a
heart
susceptible
as
hers
soon
becomes
a
fixed
and
vivid
picture
upon
the
boat
or
afterwards
i
remembered
that
at
first
sight
i
had
gazed
upon
her
with
admiring
eyes
i
remembered
that
in
hers
i
had
beheld
that
strange
expression
of
interest
which
i
had
attributed
to
curiosity
or
some
other
cause
i
knew
not
what
vanity
of
which
no
doubt
i
possess
my
share
had
not
interpreted
those
tender
glances
aright
had
not
even
whispered
me
they
were
the
flowers
of
love
easily
ripened
to
its
fruits
had
i
been
instrumental
in
nurturing
those
flowers
of
the
heart
had
i
done
aught
to
beguile
them
to
their
fatal
blooming
i
examined
the
whole
course
of
my
conduct
and
pondered
over
all
that
had
passed
between
us
i
thought
of
all
that
had
occurred
during
our
passage
upon
the
boat
during
the
tragic
scene
that
followed
i
could
not
remember
aught
either
of
word
look
or
gesture
by
which
i
might
condemn
myself
i
gave
full
play
to
my
conscience
and
it
declared
me
innocent
afterwards
after
that
terrible
night
after
those
burning
eyes
and
that
strange
face
had
passed
dreamlike
before
my
disordered
senses
after
that
moment
i
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
aught
that
was
trivial
during
the
hours
of
my
convalescence
during
the
whole
period
of
my
stay
upon
the
plantation
i
could
remember
nothing
in
my
intercourse
with
eugenie
besancon
to
give
me
cause
for
regret
towards
her
i
had
observed
a
studied
respect
nothing
more
secretly
i
felt
friendship
and
sympathy
more
especially
after
i
had
noted
the
change
in
her
manner
and
feared
that
some
cloud
was
shadowing
her
fortune
alas
poor
eugenie
little
did
i
guess
the
nature
of
that
cloud
little
did
i
dream
how
dark
it
was
notwithstanding
my
i
still
felt
pain
had
eugenie
besancon
been
a
woman
of
ordinary
character
i
might
have
borne
my
reflections
more
lightly
but
to
a
heart
so
highly
attuned
so
noble
so
passionate
what
would
be
the
shock
of
an
unrequited
love
terrible
it
must
be
perhaps
the
more
so
at
thus
finding
her
rival
in
her
own
slave
strange
confidante
had
i
chosen
for
my
secret
strange
ear
into
which
i
had
poured
the
tale
of
my
love
oh
that
i
had
not
made
my
confession
what
suffering
had
i
caused
this
fair
this
unfortunate
lady
such
painful
reflections
coursed
through
my
mind
but
there
were
others
equally
bitter
and
with
bitterness
springing
from
a
far
different
source
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
disclosure
how
would
it
affect
our
future
the
future
of
myself
and
aurore
how
would
eugenie
act
towards
me
towards
aurore
my
confession
had
received
no
response
the
mute
lips
murmured
neither
reply
nor
adieu
i
had
gazed
but
a
moment
on
the
insensible
form
aurore
had
beckoned
me
away
and
i
had
left
the
room
in
a
state
of
embarrassment
and
confusion
i
scarce
remembered
how
what
would
be
the
result
i
trembled
to
think
bitterness
hostility
revenge
surely
a
soul
so
pure
so
noble
could
not
harbour
such
passions
as
these
no
thought
i
eugenie
besancon
is
too
gentle
too
womanly
to
give
way
to
them
is
there
a
hope
that
she
may
have
pity
on
as
i
pity
or
is
there
not
she
is
a
creole
she
inherits
the
fiery
passions
of
her
race
should
these
be
aroused
to
jealousy
to
revenge
her
gratitude
will
soon
pass
away
her
love
be
changed
to
scorn
own
ah
i
well
understood
the
meaning
of
this
relationship
though
i
can
not
make
it
plain
to
you
you
can
ill
comprehend
the
horrid
feeling
talk
of
a
of
the
aristocratic
lord
with
the
daughter
of
his
peasant
retainer
of
the
dame
with
her
plebeian
groom
talk
of
the
scandal
and
scorn
to
which
such
rare
events
give
rise
all
this
is
little
is
mild
when
compared
with
the
positive
disgust
and
horror
felt
for
the
white
who
would
ally
himself
with
a
no
matter
how
white
be
no
matter
how
beautiful
even
lovely
as
aurore
he
who
would
make
her
his
must
bear
her
away
from
her
native
land
far
from
the
scenes
where
she
has
hitherto
been
known
his
all
that
is
another
affair
an
alliance
of
this
nature
is
pardonable
the
society
of
the
south
is
satisfied
with
the
but
the
that
is
an
impossibility
an
incongruity
not
to
be
borne
i
knew
that
the
gifted
eugenie
was
above
the
common
prejudices
of
her
class
but
i
should
have
expected
too
much
to
suppose
that
she
was
above
this
one
no
noble
indeed
must
be
the
soul
that
could
have
thrown
off
this
chain
coiled
around
it
by
education
by
habit
by
example
by
every
form
of
social
life
notwithstanding
all
notwithstanding
the
relations
that
existed
between
herself
and
aurore
i
could
not
expect
this
much
aurore
was
her
companion
her
friend
but
still
aurore
was
i
trembled
for
the
result
i
trembled
for
our
next
interview
in
the
future
i
saw
darkness
and
danger
i
had
but
one
hope
one
joy
the
love
of
aurore
i
rose
from
my
sleepless
couch
i
dressed
and
ate
my
breakfast
hurriedly
mechanically
that
finished
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
should
i
return
to
the
plantation
and
seek
another
interview
with
eugenie
no
not
then
i
had
not
the
courage
it
would
be
better
i
reflected
to
permit
some
time
to
pass
a
day
or
two
before
going
back
perhaps
mademoiselle
would
send
for
me
perhaps
at
all
events
it
would
be
better
to
allow
some
days
to
elapse
long
days
they
would
be
to
me
i
could
not
bear
the
society
of
any
one
i
shunned
conversation
although
i
observed
as
on
the
preceding
day
that
i
was
the
object
of
scrutiny
the
subject
of
comment
among
the
loungers
of
the
bar
and
my
acquaintances
of
the
to
avoid
them
i
remained
inside
my
room
and
endeavoured
to
kill
time
by
reading
i
soon
grew
tired
of
this
and
upon
the
third
morning
i
seized
my
gun
and
plunged
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
i
moved
amidst
the
huge
pyramidal
trunks
of
the
cypresses
whose
thick
umbellated
foliage
meeting
overhead
shut
out
both
sun
and
sky
the
very
gloom
occasioned
by
their
shade
was
congenial
to
my
thoughts
and
i
wandered
on
my
steps
guided
rather
by
accident
than
design
i
did
not
search
for
game
i
was
not
thinking
of
sport
my
gun
rested
idly
in
the
hollow
of
my
arm
the
raccoon
which
in
the
more
open
woods
is
nocturnal
is
here
abroad
by
day
i
saw
the
creature
plunging
his
food
into
the
waters
of
the
bayou
and
skulking
around
the
trunks
of
the
cypresses
i
saw
the
opossum
gliding
along
the
fallen
log
and
the
red
squirrel
like
a
stream
of
fire
brushing
up
the
bark
of
the
tall
i
saw
the
large
leap
from
her
form
by
the
selvage
of
the
and
still
more
tempting
game
the
twice
bounded
before
me
roused
from
its
covert
in
the
shady
thickets
of
the
the
wild
turkey
too
in
all
the
glitter
of
his
metallic
plumage
crossed
my
path
and
upon
the
bayou
whose
bank
i
for
some
time
followed
i
had
ample
opportunity
of
discharging
my
piece
at
the
blue
heron
or
the
egret
the
summer
duck
or
the
the
slender
ibis
or
the
stately
crane
even
the
king
of
winged
creatures
the
eagle
was
more
than
once
within
range
of
my
gun
screaming
his
maniac
note
among
the
tops
of
the
tall
taxodiums
and
still
the
brown
tubes
rested
idly
across
my
arm
nor
did
i
once
think
of
casting
my
eye
along
their
sights
no
ordinary
game
could
have
tempted
me
to
interrupt
the
current
of
my
thoughts
that
were
dwelling
upon
a
theme
to
me
the
most
interesting
in
the
world
aurore
the
quadroon
chapter
thirty
one
dreams
yielding
up
my
soul
to
its
sweet
i
wandered
on
where
and
how
long
i
can
not
tell
for
i
had
taken
no
note
either
of
distance
or
direction
i
was
roused
from
my
reverie
by
observing
a
brighter
light
gleaming
before
me
and
soon
after
i
emerged
from
the
darker
shadow
of
the
forest
my
steps
had
guided
me
into
a
pretty
glade
where
the
sun
shone
warmly
and
the
ground
was
gay
with
flowers
it
was
a
little
wild
garden
enamelled
by
blossoms
of
many
colours
among
which
bignonias
and
the
showy
corollas
of
the
were
conspicuous
even
the
forest
that
bordered
and
enclosed
this
little
parterre
was
a
forest
of
they
were
magnolias
of
several
kinds
on
some
of
which
the
large
liliaceous
blossoms
had
given
place
to
the
scarcely
less
conspicuous
of
glowing
red
whose
powerful
but
pleasant
odour
filled
the
atmosphere
around
other
beautiful
trees
grew
alongside
mingling
their
perfume
with
that
of
the
magnolias
scarce
less
interesting
were
the
with
their
pretty
pinnate
leaves
and
long
legumes
the
virginian
lotus
with
its
oval
drupes
and
the
singular
tree
with
its
large
pericarps
reminding
one
of
the
of
the
tropics
the
autumn
was
just
beginning
to
paint
the
forest
and
already
some
touches
from
his
glowing
palette
appeared
among
the
leaves
of
the
sassafras
laurel
the
sumach
the
persimmon
the
tupelo
and
those
other
species
of
the
american
that
love
to
array
themselves
so
gorgeously
before
parting
with
their
deciduous
foliage
yellow
orange
scarlet
crimson
with
many
an
intermediate
tint
met
the
eye
and
all
these
colours
flashing
under
the
brilliant
beams
of
a
noonday
sun
produced
an
indescribable
the
scene
resembled
the
gaudy
of
a
theatre
more
than
the
sober
reality
of
a
natural
landscape
i
stood
for
some
minutes
wrapt
in
admiration
the
dream
of
love
in
which
i
had
been
indulging
became
heightened
in
its
effect
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
aurore
were
but
present
to
enjoy
that
lovely
scene
to
wander
with
me
over
that
flowery
glade
to
sit
by
my
side
under
the
shade
of
the
magnolia
laurel
then
indeed
would
my
happiness
be
complete
earth
itself
had
no
fairer
scene
than
this
a
very
it
appeared
nor
was
it
unoccupied
by
lovers
for
two
pretty
doves
birds
emblematic
of
the
tender
passion
sat
side
by
side
upon
the
bough
of
a
their
bronzed
throats
swelling
at
intervals
with
soft
amorous
notes
oh
how
i
envied
those
little
creatures
how
i
should
have
rejoiced
in
a
destiny
like
theirs
thus
mated
and
happy
amidst
bright
flowers
and
sweet
perfumes
loving
the
livelong
day
loving
through
all
their
lives
they
deemed
me
an
intruder
and
rose
on
whirring
wing
at
my
approach
perchance
they
feared
my
glittering
gun
they
had
not
need
i
had
no
intention
of
harming
them
far
was
it
from
my
heart
to
spoil
their
perfect
bliss
but
no
they
feared
me
not
else
their
flight
would
have
been
more
distant
they
only
flitted
to
the
next
tree
and
there
again
seated
side
by
side
resumed
their
absorbed
in
mutual
fondness
they
had
already
forgotten
my
presence
i
followed
to
watch
these
pretty
creatures
the
types
of
gentleness
and
love
i
flung
me
on
the
grass
and
gazed
upon
thorn
tenderly
kissing
and
cooing
i
envied
their
delight
my
nerves
that
for
days
had
been
dancing
with
more
than
ordinary
excitement
were
now
experiencing
the
natural
reaction
and
i
felt
weary
there
was
a
drowsiness
in
the
air
a
narcotic
influence
produced
by
the
combined
action
of
the
sun
rays
and
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
it
acted
upon
my
spirit
and
i
fell
asleep
i
slept
only
about
an
hour
but
it
was
a
sleep
of
dreams
and
during
that
short
period
i
passed
through
many
scenes
many
a
visionary
tableau
appeared
before
the
eye
of
my
slumbering
soul
and
then
melted
away
there
were
more
or
less
characters
in
each
but
in
all
of
them
two
were
constant
both
well
defined
in
form
and
features
they
were
eugenie
and
aurore
gayarre
too
was
in
my
dreams
and
the
ruffian
overseer
and
scipio
and
the
mild
face
of
reigart
and
what
i
could
remember
of
the
good
antoine
even
the
unfortunate
captain
of
the
boat
the
boat
herself
the
magnolia
and
the
scene
of
the
wreck
all
were
reproduced
with
a
painful
distinctness
but
my
visions
were
not
all
of
a
painful
character
some
were
the
very
opposite
scenes
of
bliss
in
company
with
aurore
i
was
wandering
through
flowery
glades
and
exchanging
the
sweet
converse
of
mutual
love
the
very
spot
where
i
lay
the
scene
around
me
was
pictured
in
the
dream
strangest
of
all
i
thought
that
eugenie
was
with
us
and
that
she
too
was
happy
that
she
had
consented
to
my
marrying
aurore
and
had
even
assisted
us
in
bringing
about
this
happy
consummation
in
this
vision
gayarre
was
the
fiend
and
i
thought
that
after
a
while
he
endeavoured
to
drag
aurore
from
me
a
struggle
followed
and
then
the
scene
ended
with
confused
abruptness
a
new
tableau
arose
a
new
vision
in
this
played
the
part
of
the
evil
genius
i
thought
she
had
refused
my
requests
refused
to
i
fancied
her
jealous
hostile
vengeful
i
thought
she
was
loading
me
with
imprecations
my
betrothed
with
threats
aurore
was
weeping
it
was
a
painful
vision
the
scene
changed
again
aurore
and
i
were
happy
she
was
free
she
was
now
mine
and
we
were
married
but
there
was
a
cloud
upon
our
happiness
was
yes
dead
i
thought
i
was
bending
over
her
and
had
taken
her
hand
suddenly
her
fingers
closed
upon
mine
and
held
them
with
a
firm
pressure
i
thought
that
the
contact
was
disagreeable
and
i
endeavoured
to
withdraw
my
hand
but
could
not
my
fingers
remained
bound
within
that
cold
clammy
grasp
and
with
all
my
strength
i
was
unable
to
release
them
suddenly
i
was
stung
and
at
the
same
instant
the
chill
hand
relaxed
its
grasp
and
set
me
free
the
stinging
sensation
however
awoke
me
and
my
eyes
mechanically
turned
towards
the
hand
where
i
still
felt
pain
sure
enough
my
wrist
was
punctured
and
bleeding
a
feeling
of
horror
ran
through
my
veins
as
the
of
the
sounded
in
my
ear
and
looking
around
i
saw
the
glittering
body
of
the
reptile
extended
along
the
grass
and
gliding
rapidly
away
chapter
thirty
two
stung
by
a
snake
the
pain
was
not
a
dream
the
blood
upon
my
wrist
was
no
illusion
both
were
real
i
was
bitten
by
a
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
with
an
action
altogether
mechanical
passed
my
hand
over
the
wound
and
wiped
away
the
blood
it
was
but
a
trifling
puncture
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
the
point
of
a
lancet
and
only
a
few
drops
of
blood
oozed
from
it
such
a
wound
need
not
have
terrified
a
child
so
far
as
appearance
went
but
i
a
man
terrified
for
i
knew
that
that
little
incision
had
been
made
by
a
dread
instrument
by
the
envenomed
fang
of
a
serpent
and
one
hour
i
might
be
my
first
impulse
was
to
pursue
the
snake
and
destroy
it
but
before
i
could
act
upon
that
impulse
the
reptile
had
escaped
beyond
my
reach
a
hollow
log
lay
near
the
trunk
of
a
large
with
the
decayed
and
gone
the
snake
had
made
for
this
no
doubt
its
haunt
and
before
i
could
come
up
with
it
i
saw
the
long
slimy
body
with
its
rhomboid
spots
disappear
within
the
dark
cavity
another
reached
my
ears
as
it
glided
out
of
sight
it
seemed
a
note
of
triumph
as
if
uttered
to
tantalise
me
the
reptile
was
now
beyond
my
reach
but
its
destruction
would
not
have
availed
me
its
death
could
not
counteract
the
effect
of
its
poison
already
in
my
veins
i
knew
that
well
enough
but
for
all
i
would
have
killed
it
had
it
been
in
my
power
to
do
so
i
felt
angry
and
vengeful
this
was
but
my
first
impulse
it
suddenly
became
changed
to
a
feeling
of
terror
there
was
something
so
weird
in
the
look
of
the
reptile
something
so
strange
in
the
manner
of
its
attack
and
subsequent
escape
that
on
losing
sight
of
it
i
became
suddenly
impressed
with
a
sort
of
supernatural
awe
a
belief
that
the
creature
was
possessed
of
a
fiendish
intelligence
under
this
impression
i
remained
for
some
moments
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
the
sight
of
the
blood
and
the
stinging
sensation
of
the
wound
soon
brought
me
to
my
senses
again
and
admonished
me
of
the
necessity
of
taking
immediate
steps
to
procure
an
antidote
to
the
poison
but
what
antidote
what
knew
i
of
such
things
i
was
but
a
classical
scholar
true
i
had
lately
given
some
attention
to
botanical
studies
but
my
new
knowledge
extended
only
to
the
of
the
forest
and
none
of
these
with
which
i
was
acquainted
possessed
alexipharmic
virtues
i
knew
nothing
of
the
herbaceous
plants
the
and
that
would
now
have
served
me
the
woods
might
have
been
filled
with
antidotal
remedies
and
i
have
died
in
their
midst
yes
i
might
have
lain
down
upon
a
bed
of
seneca
root
and
amidst
terrible
convulsions
have
breathed
my
last
breath
without
knowing
that
the
rhizome
of
the
humble
plant
crushed
beneath
my
body
would
in
a
few
short
hours
have
expelled
the
venom
from
my
veins
and
given
me
life
and
health
i
lost
no
time
in
speculating
upon
such
a
means
of
safety
i
had
but
one
thought
and
that
was
to
reach
bringiers
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
my
hopes
rested
upon
reigart
i
hastily
took
up
my
gun
and
plunging
once
more
under
the
dark
shadows
of
the
i
hurried
on
with
nervous
strides
i
ran
as
fast
as
my
limbs
would
carry
me
but
the
shock
of
terror
i
had
experienced
seemed
to
have
enfeebled
my
whole
frame
and
my
knees
knocked
against
each
other
as
i
went
on
i
struggled
regardless
of
my
weakness
regardless
of
everything
but
the
thought
of
reaching
bringiers
and
reigart
over
fallen
trees
through
dense
through
clumps
of
palmettoes
and
pawpaw
thickets
i
passed
dashing
the
branches
from
my
path
and
lacerating
my
skin
at
every
step
onward
through
sluggish
rivulets
of
water
through
tough
miry
mud
through
slimy
pools
filled
with
horrid
newts
and
the
spawn
of
the
huge
whose
hoarse
loud
croak
at
every
step
sounded
ominous
in
my
ear
onward
ho
whither
am
i
going
where
is
the
path
where
the
tracks
of
my
former
footsteps
not
here
not
there
good
god
i
have
lost
them
lost
lost
quick
as
lightning
came
these
thoughts
i
looked
around
with
eager
glances
on
every
side
i
scanned
the
ground
i
saw
no
path
no
tracks
but
those
i
had
just
made
i
saw
no
marks
that
i
could
remember
i
had
lost
my
way
beyond
a
doubt
i
was
lost
a
thrill
of
despair
ran
through
me
the
blood
curdled
cold
in
my
veins
at
the
thought
of
my
peril
no
wonder
if
lost
in
the
forest
then
was
i
lost
indeed
a
single
hour
might
be
enough
in
that
time
the
poison
would
do
its
work
i
should
be
found
only
by
the
wolves
and
vultures
o
god
as
if
to
make
my
horrid
fate
appear
more
certain
i
now
remembered
to
have
heard
that
it
was
the
very
season
of
the
year
the
hot
autumn
when
the
venom
of
the
is
most
virulent
and
does
its
work
in
the
shortest
period
of
time
cases
are
recorded
where
in
a
single
hour
its
bite
has
proved
fatal
merciful
heaven
thought
i
in
another
hour
i
shall
be
no
more
and
the
thought
was
followed
by
a
groan
the
danger
nerved
me
to
renewed
efforts
i
turned
back
on
my
tracks
it
seemed
the
best
thing
i
could
do
for
in
the
gloomy
circle
around
there
was
no
point
that
indicated
my
approach
to
the
open
ground
of
the
plantations
not
a
bit
of
sky
could
i
discover
that
welcome
beacon
to
the
denoting
the
proximity
of
the
clearings
even
the
heaven
above
was
curtained
from
my
view
and
when
i
appealed
to
it
in
prayer
my
eyes
rested
only
upon
the
thick
black
foliage
of
the
with
their
mournful
drapery
of
i
had
no
choice
but
to
go
back
and
endeavour
to
find
the
path
i
had
lost
or
wander
on
trusting
to
mere
chance
i
chose
the
former
alternative
again
i
broke
through
the
and
again
i
forded
sluggish
bayous
and
waded
across
muddy
pools
i
had
not
proceeded
more
than
a
hundred
yards
on
the
back
track
when
that
also
became
doubtful
i
had
passed
over
a
reach
of
ground
higher
and
drier
than
the
rest
here
no
footprints
appeared
and
i
knew
not
which
way
i
had
taken
i
tried
in
several
directions
but
could
not
discover
my
way
i
became
confused
and
at
length
completely
bewildered
again
was
i
lost
to
have
been
lost
in
the
forest
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
mattered
little
an
hour
or
two
of
wandering
perhaps
a
night
spent
under
the
shade
of
some
tree
with
the
slight
inconvenience
of
a
hungry
stomach
but
how
very
different
was
my
prospect
then
with
the
fearful
thoughts
that
were
pressing
upon
me
the
poison
was
fast
inoculating
my
blood
i
fancied
i
already
felt
it
crawling
through
my
veins
one
more
struggle
to
find
the
clearings
i
rushed
on
now
guided
by
chance
i
endeavoured
to
keep
in
a
straight
line
but
to
no
purpose
the
huge
pyramidal
buttresses
of
the
trees
so
characteristic
of
these
barred
my
way
and
in
passing
around
them
i
soon
lost
all
knowledge
of
my
direction
i
wandered
on
now
dragging
wearily
across
the
dull
ditches
now
floundering
through
tracts
of
swamp
or
climbing
over
huge
prostrate
logs
in
my
passage
i
startled
the
thousand
denizens
of
the
dank
forest
who
greeted
me
with
their
cries
the
screamed
the
hooted
the
bullfrog
uttered
his
and
the
hideous
alligator
horribly
bellowing
from
his
gaunt
jaws
crawled
sulkily
out
of
my
way
at
times
appearing
as
if
he
would
turn
and
assail
me
ho
yonder
is
light
the
sky
it
was
but
a
small
patch
of
the
blue
heaven
a
disc
not
larger
than
a
but
oh
you
can
not
understand
with
what
joy
i
greeted
that
bright
spot
it
was
the
lighthouse
to
the
lost
mariner
it
must
be
the
clearings
yes
i
could
see
the
sun
shining
through
the
trees
and
the
horizon
open
as
i
advanced
no
doubt
the
plantations
were
before
me
once
there
i
should
soon
cross
the
fields
and
reach
the
town
i
should
yet
be
safe
reigart
would
surely
know
how
to
extract
the
poison
or
apply
some
antidote
i
kept
on
with
bounding
heart
and
straining
eyes
on
for
the
bright
meteor
before
me
the
blue
spot
grew
larger
other
pieces
of
sky
appeared
the
forest
grew
thinner
as
i
advanced
i
was
drawing
nearer
to
its
verge
the
ground
became
firmer
and
drier
at
every
step
and
the
timber
of
a
lighter
growth
the
shapeless
cypress
knees
no
longer
impeded
my
progress
i
now
passed
among
dogwoods
and
magnolias
less
densely
grew
the
trunks
lighter
and
less
shadowy
became
the
foliage
above
until
at
length
i
pushed
through
the
last
selvage
of
the
underwood
and
stood
in
the
open
sunshine
a
cry
of
agony
rose
upon
my
lips
it
was
wrung
from
me
by
despair
i
had
arrived
at
my
point
of
starting
i
was
once
more
within
the
glade
i
sought
not
to
go
farther
fatigue
disappointment
and
chagrin
had
for
the
moment
paralysed
my
strength
i
staggered
forward
to
a
prostrate
trunk
the
very
one
which
sheltered
my
reptile
assassin
and
sat
down
in
a
state
of
irresolution
and
bewilderment
it
seemed
as
though
i
were
destined
to
die
in
that
lovely
glade
amidst
those
bright
flowers
in
the
midst
of
that
scene
i
had
so
lately
admired
and
upon
the
very
spot
where
i
had
received
my
fatal
wound
chapter
thirty
three
the
runaway
man
rarely
yields
up
his
life
without
an
extreme
effort
to
preserve
it
despair
is
a
strong
feeling
but
there
are
those
whose
spirit
it
can
not
prostrate
in
later
life
mine
own
would
not
have
given
way
to
such
circumstances
as
surrounded
me
at
that
time
but
i
was
then
young
and
little
experienced
in
peril
the
paralysis
of
my
thoughts
did
not
continue
long
my
senses
returned
again
and
i
resolved
to
make
a
new
effort
for
the
salvation
of
my
life
i
had
conceived
no
plan
further
than
to
endeavour
once
more
to
escape
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
woods
and
morass
in
which
i
had
become
entangled
and
make
as
before
for
the
village
i
thought
i
knew
the
direction
in
which
it
lay
by
observing
the
side
at
which
i
had
first
entered
the
glade
but
after
all
there
was
no
certainty
in
this
it
was
mere
conjecture
i
had
entered
the
glade
with
negligent
steps
i
had
strayed
all
around
it
before
lying
down
to
sleep
perhaps
i
had
gone
around
its
sides
before
entering
it
for
i
had
been
wandering
all
the
morning
while
these
reflections
were
passing
rapidly
through
my
mind
and
despair
once
more
taking
possession
of
my
spirits
i
all
at
once
remembered
having
heard
that
tobacco
is
a
powerful
antidote
to
strange
the
idea
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
but
indeed
there
was
nothing
wonderful
that
it
did
not
as
up
to
that
moment
i
had
only
thought
of
making
my
way
to
bringiers
with
no
reliance
upon
my
own
knowledge
i
had
thought
only
of
a
doctor
it
was
only
when
i
became
apprehensive
of
not
being
able
to
get
to
that
i
began
to
think
of
what
resources
lay
within
my
reach
i
now
remembered
the
tobacco
quick
as
the
thought
my
was
in
my
fingers
to
my
joy
one
cigar
still
remained
and
drawing
it
out
i
proceeded
to
macerate
the
tobacco
by
chewing
this
i
had
heard
was
the
mode
of
applying
it
to
the
snakebite
dry
as
was
my
mouth
at
first
the
bitter
weed
soon
supplied
me
with
saliva
and
in
a
few
moments
i
had
reduced
the
leaves
to
a
pulp
though
nauseated
almost
poisoned
by
the
powerful
i
laid
the
moistened
mass
upon
my
wrist
and
at
the
same
time
rubbed
it
forcibly
into
the
wound
i
now
perceived
that
my
arm
was
sensibly
swollen
even
up
to
the
elbow
and
a
singular
pain
began
to
be
felt
throughout
its
whole
length
o
god
the
poison
was
spreading
surely
and
rapidly
spreading
i
fancied
i
could
feel
it
like
liquid
fire
crawling
and
filtering
through
my
veins
though
i
had
made
application
of
the
nicotine
i
had
but
little
faith
in
it
i
had
only
heard
it
casually
talked
of
as
a
remedy
it
might
thought
i
be
one
of
the
thousand
fancies
that
people
love
to
indulge
in
and
i
had
only
used
it
as
a
forlorn
hope
i
bound
the
mass
to
my
wrist
a
torn
sleeve
serving
for
lint
and
then
turning
my
face
in
the
direction
i
intended
to
take
i
started
off
afresh
i
had
scarce
made
three
strides
when
my
steps
were
suddenly
arrested
i
stopped
on
observing
a
man
on
the
edge
of
the
glade
and
directly
in
front
of
me
he
had
just
come
out
of
the
underwood
towards
which
i
was
advancing
and
on
perceiving
me
had
suddenly
halted
perhaps
surprised
at
the
sight
of
one
of
his
own
kind
in
such
a
wild
place
i
hailed
his
appearance
with
a
shout
of
joy
a
guide
a
deliverer
thought
i
what
was
my
astonishment
my
chagrin
my
indignation
when
the
man
suddenly
turned
his
back
upon
me
and
plunging
into
the
bushes
disappeared
from
my
sight
i
was
astounded
at
this
strange
conduct
i
had
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
face
as
he
turned
away
i
had
seen
that
he
was
a
negro
and
i
had
noticed
that
he
appeared
to
be
frightened
but
what
was
there
about
me
to
terrify
him
i
called
out
to
him
to
stop
to
come
back
i
shouted
in
tones
of
entreaty
of
command
of
menace
in
vain
he
made
neither
stop
nor
stay
i
heard
the
branches
crackle
as
he
broke
through
the
thicket
each
moment
the
noise
appearing
more
distant
it
was
my
only
chance
for
a
guide
i
must
not
lose
it
and
bracing
myself
for
a
run
i
started
after
him
if
i
possess
any
physical
accomplishment
in
which
i
have
confidence
it
is
my
fleetness
of
foot
at
that
time
an
indian
runner
could
not
have
escaped
me
much
less
a
clumsy
negro
i
knew
that
if
i
could
once
more
got
my
eyes
upon
the
black
i
would
soon
overhaul
him
but
therein
lay
the
difficulty
in
my
hesitation
i
had
given
him
a
long
start
and
he
was
now
out
of
sight
in
the
depth
of
the
thicket
but
i
could
hear
him
breaking
through
the
bushes
like
a
hog
and
guiding
myself
by
the
sound
i
kept
up
the
pursuit
i
was
already
somewhat
jaded
by
my
previous
exertions
but
the
conviction
that
life
depended
on
overtaking
the
kindled
my
energies
afresh
and
i
ran
like
a
greyhound
unfortunately
it
was
not
a
question
of
simple
speed
else
the
chase
would
soon
have
been
brought
to
an
end
it
was
in
getting
through
the
bushes
and
dodging
round
the
trunks
of
the
trees
that
the
hindrance
lay
and
i
had
many
a
struggle
among
the
branches
and
many
a
zigzag
turn
to
make
before
i
could
get
my
eyes
upon
the
object
i
was
in
pursuit
of
however
i
at
length
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
underwood
came
to
an
end
the
misshapen
cypress
trunks
alone
stood
up
out
of
the
miry
black
soil
and
far
off
down
one
of
their
dark
aisles
i
caught
sight
of
the
negro
still
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
fortunately
his
garments
were
else
under
the
sombre
shadow
i
could
not
have
made
him
out
as
it
was
i
had
only
a
glimpse
of
him
and
at
a
good
distance
off
but
i
had
cleared
the
thicket
and
could
run
freely
swiftness
had
now
everything
to
do
with
the
race
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
i
was
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
black
and
calling
to
him
to
halt
stop
i
shouted
for
god
sake
stop
no
notice
was
taken
of
my
appeals
the
negro
did
not
even
turn
his
head
but
ran
on
floundering
through
the
mud
stop
i
repeated
as
loudly
as
my
exhausted
breath
would
permit
stop
man
why
do
you
run
from
me
i
mean
you
no
harm
neither
did
this
speech
produce
any
effect
no
reply
was
given
if
anything
i
fancied
that
he
increased
his
speed
or
rather
perhaps
he
had
got
through
the
quagmire
and
was
running
upon
firm
ground
while
i
was
just
entering
upon
the
former
i
fancied
that
the
distance
between
us
was
again
widening
and
began
to
fear
he
might
still
elude
me
i
felt
that
my
life
was
on
the
result
without
him
to
guide
me
from
the
forest
i
would
miserably
perish
he
guide
me
willing
or
unwilling
i
should
force
him
to
the
office
stop
i
again
cried
out
halt
or
i
fire
i
had
raised
my
gun
both
barrels
were
loaded
i
had
spoken
in
all
seriousness
i
should
in
reality
have
fired
not
to
kill
but
to
detain
him
the
shot
might
injure
him
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
had
no
choice
no
other
means
of
saving
my
own
life
i
repeated
the
awful
summons
stop
or
i
fire
this
time
my
tone
was
earnest
it
left
no
doubt
of
my
intention
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
impression
it
produced
upon
the
black
for
suddenly
halting
in
his
tracks
he
wheeled
about
and
stood
facing
me
fire
and
be
dam
cried
he
have
a
care
white
man
do
you
miss
by
if
ya
do
your
life
mine
see
dis
knife
fire
now
and
be
dam
as
he
spoke
he
stood
full
fronting
me
his
broad
chest
thrown
out
as
if
courageously
to
receive
the
shot
and
in
his
uplifted
hand
i
saw
the
shining
blade
of
a
knife
a
few
steps
brought
me
close
up
and
in
the
man
that
stood
before
me
i
recognised
the
form
and
ferocious
aspect
of
the
chapter
thirty
four
gabriel
the
bambarra
the
huge
stature
of
the
black
his
determined
attitude
the
sullen
glare
of
his
lurid
bloodshot
eyes
set
in
a
look
of
desperate
resolve
the
white
gleaming
teeth
rendered
him
a
terrible
object
to
behold
under
other
circumstances
i
might
have
dreaded
an
encounter
with
such
a
adversary
for
an
i
deemed
him
i
remembered
the
flogging
i
had
given
him
with
my
whip
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
remembered
it
too
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
now
upon
his
errand
of
revenge
instigated
partly
by
the
insult
i
had
put
upon
him
and
partly
set
on
by
his
cowardly
master
he
had
been
dogging
me
through
the
forest
all
the
day
perhaps
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
execute
his
purpose
but
why
had
he
run
away
from
me
was
it
because
he
feared
to
attack
me
openly
certainly
it
was
he
feared
my
gun
but
i
had
been
asleep
he
might
have
approached
me
then
he
might
have
ha
this
ejaculation
escaped
my
lips
as
a
singular
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
the
bambarra
was
a
i
had
heard
so
could
handle
the
most
venomous
serpents
at
rail
could
guide
and
direct
them
was
it
not
he
who
had
guided
the
to
where
i
lay
who
had
caused
me
to
be
bitten
strange
as
it
may
appear
this
supposition
at
that
moment
crossed
my
mind
and
seemed
probable
nay
more
i
actually
i
remembered
that
i
had
been
struck
with
a
peculiarity
about
the
reptile
its
weird
look
the
superior
cunning
exhibited
in
its
mode
of
escape
and
not
less
peculiar
the
fact
of
its
having
stung
me
unprovoked
a
rare
thing
for
the
rattlesnake
to
do
all
these
points
rushing
simultaneously
into
my
mind
produced
the
conviction
that
for
the
fatal
wound
on
my
wrist
i
was
indebted
not
to
chance
but
to
gabriel
the
not
half
the
time
i
have
been
telling
you
of
it
not
the
tenth
nor
the
hundredth
part
of
the
time
was
i
in
forming
this
horrid
conviction
it
was
done
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
the
more
rapid
that
every
circumstance
guiding
to
such
a
conclusion
was
fresh
in
my
memory
in
fact
the
black
had
not
changed
his
attitude
of
menace
nor
i
mine
of
surprise
at
recognising
him
until
all
these
thoughts
had
passed
through
my
mind
almost
with
equal
rapidity
was
i
disabused
of
the
singular
delusion
in
another
minute
i
became
aware
that
my
suspicions
were
unjust
i
had
been
wronging
the
man
who
stood
before
me
all
at
once
his
attitude
changed
his
uplifted
arm
fell
by
his
side
the
expression
of
fierce
menace
disappeared
and
in
as
mild
a
tone
as
his
rough
voice
was
capable
of
giving
utterance
to
he
said
oh
you
mass
brack
man
friend
dam
thought
da
cussed
yankee
driber
and
was
that
why

so
runaway
do
mind
tell
you
truss
you
he
know
you
am
poor
nigga
friend
as
he
uttered
this
last
phrase
he
pulled
off
the
scanty
rag
of
a
shirt
that
covered
his
shoulders
and
bared
his
back
before
my
eyes
a
horrid
sight
it
was
besides
the
and
many
other
old
brands
there
were
sears
of
more
recent
date
long
wales
and
swollen
traversed
the
brown
skin
in
every
direction
forming
perfect
network
here
they
were
traceable
by
the
darker
colour
of
the
extravasatod
blood
while
there
the
flesh
itself
lay
bare
where
it
had
been
exposed
to
some
prominent
fold
of
the
cowskin
the
old
shirt
itself
was
stained
with
black
blotches
that
had
once
been
red
the
blood
that
had
oozed
out
during
the
infliction
the
sight
sickened
me
and
called
forth
the
involuntary
utterance
poor
fellow
this
expression
of
sympathy
evidently
touched
the
rude
heart
of
the
bambarra
ah
mass
he
continued
you

with
dat
bress

for

mass

but
here
the
speaker
hesitated
while
his
face
resumed
its
fierce
expression
but
continued

yankee
dam

the
hoarse

with
which
the
runaway
expressed
his
satisfaction
sounded
strangely
on
my
ear
and
you
have
run
away
from
the
plantation
jes
so
mass
edward
nebber
go
back
after
a
pause
he
added
with
increased
emphasis
go
back
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
broad
chest
at
the
same
time
throwing
his
body
into
an
attitude
of
earnest
determination
i
saw
at
once
that
i
had
mistaken
the
character
of
this
man
i
had
had
it
from
his
enemies
the
whites
who
feared
him
with
all
the
ferocity
of
expression
that
characterised
his
features
there
was
evidently
something
noble
in
his
heart
he
had
been
flogged
for
refusing
to
flog
a
he
had
resented
the
punishment
and
struck
down
his
brutal
oppressor
by
so
doing
he
had
risked
a
far
more
terrible
punishment
even
life
itself
it
required
courage
to
do
all
this
a
spirit
of
liberty
alone
could
have
inspired
him
with
that
courage
the
same
spirit
which
impelled
the
swiss
patriot
to
strike
down
the
cap
of
gessler
as
the
negro
stood
with
his
thick
muscular
fingers
spread
over
his
brawny
chest
with
form
erect
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
fixed
in
stern
resolve
i
was
impressed
with
an
air
of
grandeur
about
him
and
could
not
help
thinking
that
in
the
black
form
before
me
scantily
clad
in
coarse
cotton
there
was
the
soul
and
spirit
of
a
man
chapter
thirty
five
the
with
admiring
eyes
i
looked
for
some
moments
on
this
bold
black
man

i
might
have
gazed

but
the
burning
sensation
in
my
arm
reminded
me

i
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
peculiar
reputation
which
the
black
enjoyed
that
of
a
and
as
well
although
i
had
so
late
been
thinking
of
it
the
remembrance
of
this
fact
now
returned
accompanied
by
a
very
different
train
of
reflections
no
doubt
thought
i
he
possesses
the
requisite
knowledge
knows
the
antidote
and
how
to
apply
it
no
doubt
he
is
the
very
man
the
doctor
as
he
says
may
not
understand
how
to
treat
me
i
had
no
very
great
confidence
that
the
doctor
could
cure
me
i
was
only
running
to
him
as
a
sort
of
this
gabriel
this
is
the
very
man
how
fortunate
i
should
have
met
with
him
after
a
moment
hesitation
during
the
time
these
reflections
were
passing
through
my
mind
i
called
out
to
the
black
lead
on
i
follow
you
whither
did
he
intend
to
guide
me
what
was
he
going
to
do
where
was
to
find
an
antidote
how
was
he
to
cure
me
to
these
questions
hurriedly
put
i
received
no
reply
you
truss
me
mass
edward
you
foller
me
were
all
the
words
the
black
would
utter
as
he
strode
off
among
the
trees
i
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
him
after
proceeding
several
hundred
yards
through
the
cypress
swamp
i
saw
some
spots
of
sky
in
front
of
us
this
indicated
an
opening
in
the
woods
and
for
that
i
saw
my
guide
was
heading
i
was
not
surprised
on
reaching
this
opening
to
find
that
it
was
the
glade
again
the
fatal
glade
to
my
eyes
how
changed
its
aspect
i
could
not
bear
the
bright
sun
that
gleamed
into
it
the
sheen
of
its
flowers
wearied
my
sight
their
perfume
made
me
sick
maybe
i
only
fancied
this
i
was
sick
but
from
a
very
different
cause
the
poison
was
mingling
with
my
blood
it
was
setting
my
veins
on
fire
i
was
tortured
by
a
choking
sensation
of
thirst
and
already
felt
that
spasmodic
compression
of
the
chest
and
difficulty
of
breathing
the
symptoms
experienced
by
the
victims
of
it
may
be
that
i
only
fancied
most
of
this
i
knew
that
a
venomous
serpent
had
bitten
me
and
that
knowledge
may
have
excited
my
imagination
to
an
extreme
susceptibility
whether
the
symptoms
did
in
reality
exist
i
suffered
them
all
the
same
my
fancy
had
all
the
painfulness
of
reality
my
companion
directed
me
to
be
seated
moving
about
he
said
was
not
good
he
desired
me
to
be
calm
and
patient
once
more
begging
me
to
truss
i
resolved
to
be
quiet
though
patient
i
could
not
be
my
peril
was
too
great
physically
i
obeyed
him
i
sat
down
upon
a
log
that
same
log
of
the
liriodendron
and
under
the
shade
of
a
spreading
with
all
the
patience
i
could
command
i
sat
awaiting
the
orders
of
the
he
had
gone
off
a
little
way
and
was
now
wandering
around
the
glade
with
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
he
appeared
to
be
searching
for
something
some
plant
thought
i
he
expects
to
find
growing
there
i
watched
his
movements
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
i
need
hardly
have
said
this
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
say
that
i
felt
my
life
depended
on
the
result
of
his
search
his
success
or
his
failure
were
life
or
death
to
me
how
my
heart
leaped
when
i
saw
him
bend
forward
and
then
stoop
still
lower
as
if
clutching
something
upon
the
ground
an
exclamation
of
joy
that
escaped
his
lips
was
echoed
in
a
louder
key
from
my
own
and
forgetting
his
directions
to
remain
quiet
i
sprang
up
from
the
log
and
ran
towards
him
as
i
approached
he
was
upon
his
knees
and
with
his
was
digging
around
a
plant
as
if
to
raise
it
by
the
roots
it
was
a
small
herbaceous
plant
with
erect
simple
stem
oblong
lanceolate
leaves
and
a
terminal
spike
of
not
very
conspicuous
white
flowers
though
i
knew
it
not
then
it
was
the
famed
in
a
few
moments
he
had
removed
the
earth
and
then
drawing
out
the
plant
shook
its
roots
free
of
the
mould
i
noticed
that
a
mass
of
woody
contorted
rhizomes
somewhat
thicker
than
those
of
the
sarsaparilla
briar
adhered
to
the
stem
they
were
covered
with
bark
and
quite
inodorous
amid
the
fibres
of
these
roots
lay
the
antidote
to
the
in
their
sap
was
the
saviour
of
my
rife
not
a
moment
was
lost
in
preparing
them
there
were
no
hieroglyphics
nor
latinic
phraseology
employed
in
the
prescription
of
the
it
was
comprised
in
the
phrase
and
along
with
this
simple
direction
a
piece
of
the
root
scraped
clear
of
the
bark
was
put
into
my
hand
i
did
as
i
was
desired
and
in
a
moment
i
had
reduced
the
root
to
a
pulp
and
was
swallowing
its
sanitary
juices
the
taste
was
at
first
rather
sweetish
and
engendered
a
slight
feeling
of
nausea
but
as
i
continued
to
chew
it
became
hot
and
pungent
producing
a
peculiar
tingling
sensation
in
the
fauces
and
throat
the
black
now
ran
to
the
nearest
brook
filled
one
of
his
brogans
with
water
and
returning
washed
my
wrist
until
the
tobacco
juice
was
all
removed
from
the
wound
having
himself
chewed
a
number
of
the
leaves
of
the
plant
into
a
pulpy
mass
he
placed
it
directly
upon
the
bitten
part
and
then
bound
up
the
wound
as
before
everything
was
now
done
that
could
be
done
i
was
instructed
to
abide
the
result
patiently
and
without
fear
in
a
very
short
time
a
profuse
perspiration
broke
out
over
my
whole
body
and
i
began
to
expectorate
freely
i
felt
moreover
a
strong
inclination
to
vomit
which
i
should
have
done
had
i
swallowed
any
more
of
the
juice
for
taken
in
large
doses
the
seneca
root
is
a
powerful
emetic
but
of
the
feelings
i
experienced
at
that
moment
the
most
agreeable
was
the
belief
that
was
strange
to
say
this
belief
almost
at
once
impressed
my
mind
with
the
force
of
a
conviction
i
no
longer
doubted
the
skill
of
the
chapter
thirty
six
charming
the
crotalus
i
was
destined
to
witness
still
further
proofs
of
the
wonderful
capabilities
of
my
new
acquaintance
i
felt
the
natural
joy
of
one
whose
life
has
been
saved
from
destruction
singularly
almost
miraculously
saved
like
one
who
has
escaped
from
drowning
from
the
field
of
slaughter
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
the
reaction
was
delightful
i
felt
gratitude
too
for
him
who
had
saved
me
i
could
have
embraced
my
sable
companion
black
and
fierce
as
he
was
like
a
brother
we
sat
side
by
side
upon
the
log
and
chatted
gaily
gaily
as
men
may
whose
future
is
dark
and
unsettled
alas
it
was
so
with
both
of
us
mine
had
been
dark
for
days
past
and
his
what
was
his
poor
helot
but
even
in
the
gloom
of
sadness
the
mind
has
its
moments
of
joy
nature
has
not
allowed
that
grief
may
be
continuous
and
at
intervals
the
spirit
must
soar
above
its
sorrows
such
an
interval
was
upon
me
then
joy
and
gratitude
were
in
my
heart
i
had
grown
fond
of
this
slave
this
runaway
slave
and
was
for
the
moment
happy
in
his
companionship
it
was
natural
our
conversation
should
be
of
snakes
and
and
many
a
strange
fact
he
imparted
to
me
relating
to
reptile
life
a
herpetologist
might
have
envied
me
the
hour
i
spent
upon
that
log
in
the
company
of
gabriel
the
bambarra
in
the
midst
of
our
conversation
my
companion
abruptly
asked
the
question
whether
i
had
killed
the
snake
that
had
bitten
me
no
i
replied
it
escaped
mass
whar
did
um
go
it
took
shelter
in
a
hollow
log
the
very
one
on
which
we
are
seated
the
eyes
of
the
negro
sparkled
with
delight
dam
exclaimed
he
starting
to
his
feet
mass

repeated

nigga

rattlesnake
right
out
ob
boots
please
young
mass
keep
still
do
speak
de
breff
ole
varmint
he
hear
ebbery
word
the
black
now
talked
in
whispers
as
he
glided
stealthily
around
the
log
i
followed
his
directions
and
remained
perfectly
still
watching
every
movement
of
my
singular
companion
some
young
reeds
of
the
american
bamboo
were
growing
near
a
number
of
these
he
cut
down
with
his
knife
and
then
sharpening
their
lower
ends
stuck
them
into
the
ground
near
the
end
of
the
log
he
arranged
the
reeds
in
such
a
manner
that
they
stood
side
by
side
like
the
strings
of
a
harp
only
closer
together
he
next
chose
a
small
sapling
from
the
thicket
and
trimmed
it
so
that
nothing
remained
but
a
straight
wand
with
a
forked
end
with
this
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
split
cane
in
the
other
he
placed
himself
flat
along
the
log
in
such
a
position
that
his
face
was
directly
over
the
entrance
to
the
cavity
he
was
also
close
to
the
row
of
canes
so
that
with
his
outstretched
hand
he
could
conveniently
reach
them
his
arrangements
were
now
completed
and
the
charm
commenced
laying
aside
the
forked
sapling
ready
to
his
hand
he
took
the
piece
of
split
reed
and
drew
it
backward
and
forward
across
the
row
of
upright
canes
this
produced
a
sound
which
was
an
exact
imitation
of
the
skerr
of
the
rattlesnake
go
like
that
a
person
hearing
it
without
knowing
what
caused
it
would
undoubtedly
have
mistaken
it
for
the
latter
so
like
that
the
black
knew
the
reptile
itself
would
be
deceived
by
it
he
did
not
however
trust
to
this
alone
to
allure
his
victim
aided
by
an
instrument
which
he
had
hastily
constructed
out
of
the
lanceolate
leaves
of
the
cane
he
at
the
same
time
imitated
the
scream
and
chatter
of
the
red
cardinal
just
as
when
that
bird
is
engaged
in
battle
either
with
a
serpent
an
opossum
or
some
other
of
its
habitual
enemies
the
sounds
produced
were
exactly
similar
to
those
often
heard
in
the
depths
of
the
american
forest
when
the
dread
plunders
the
nest
of
the
virginian
nightingale
the
stratagem
proved
successful
in
a
few
moments
the
head
of
the
reptile
appeared
outside
the
cavity
its
forking
tongue
was
protruded
at
short
intervals
and
its
small
dark
eyes
glittered
with
rage
its
rattle
could
be
heard
announcing
its
determination
to
take
part
in
the
fray
which
it
supposed
was
going
on
outside
it
had
glided
out
nearly
the
full
length
of
its
body
and
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
deception
for
it
was
turning
round
to
retreat
but
the
is
one
of
the
most
sluggish
of
snakes
and
before
it
could
get
back
within
the
log
the
forked
sapling
descended
upon
its
neck
and
pinned
it
fast
to
the
ground
its
body
now
writhed
over
the
grass
in
helpless
contortions
a
formidable
creature
to
behold
it
was
a
snake
of
the
largest
size
for
its
species
being
nearly
eight
feet
in
length
and
as
thick
as
the
wrist
of
the
bambarra
himself
even
he
was
astonished
at
its
proportions
and
assured
me
it
was
the
largest
of
its
kind
he
had
ever
encountered
i
expected
to
see
the
black
put
an
end
to
its
struggles
at
once
by
killing
it
and
i
essayed
to
help
him
with
my
gun
no
mass
cried
he
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
for
luv
ob
de
ormighty
do
fire
de
gun
mass
forget
dat
dis
poor
nigga
am
runaway
i
understood
his
meaning
and
lowered
the
piece
continued
he
got
somethin

mass
yet
he
like
see
curious
thing
he
like
see
de
big
snake

i
replied
in
the
affirmative
well

stick

now
berry
curious

i
see
berry
curious
berry
scace
dat
plant
i
seed
it
in
de
catch
mass
while
i
go
get
um
i
took
hold
of
the
sapling
and
held
it
as
desired
though
not
without
some
apprehension
of
the
hideous
reptile
that
curled
and
writhed
at
my
feet
i
had
no
need
to
fear
however
the
fork
was
exactly
across
the
small
of
the
creature
neck
and
it
could
not
raise
its
head
to
strike
me
large
as
it
was
there
was
no
danger
from
anything
but
its
fangs
for
the
unlike
serpents
of
the
genus
possesses
but
a
very
feeble
power
of
compression
gabriel
had
gone
off
among
the
bushes
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
him
returning
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
plant
which
as
before
he
had
pulled
up
by
the
roots
like
the
former
it
was
a
herbaceous
plant
but
of
a
very
different
appearance
the
leaves
of
this
one
were
and
acuminate
its
stem
sinuous
and
its
flowers
of
a
dark
purple
colour
as
the
black
approached
i
saw
that
he
was
chewing
some
parts
both
of
the
leaves
and
root
what
did
he
mean
to
do
i
was
not
left
long
in
suspense
as
soon
as
he
had
arrived
upon
the
ground
he
stooped
down
and
spat
a
quantity
of
the
juice
over
the
head
of
the
snake
then
taking
the
sapling
out
of
my
hand
he
plucked
it
up
and
flung
it
away
to
my
dismay
the
snake
was
now
set
free
and
i
lost
no
time
in
springing
backward
and
mounting
upon
the
log
not
so
my
companion
who
once
more
stooped
down
caught
hold
of
the
hideous
reptile
fearlessly
raised
it
from
the
ground
and
flung
it
around
his
neck
as
coolly
as
if
it
had
been
a
piece
of
rope
the
snake
made
no
effort
to
bite
him
neither
did
it
seem
desirous
of
escaping
from
his
grasp
it
appeared
rather
to
be
stupefied
and
without
the
power
of
doing
injury
after
playing
with
it
for
some
moments
the
bambarra
threw
it
back
to
the
ground
even
there
it
made
no
effort
to
escape
the
charmer
now
turned
to
me
and
said
in
a
tone
of
triumph
now
mass
edward
you
shall
hab
rebenge
look
at
dis
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
his
thumb
against
the
fauces
of
the
serpent
until
its
mouth
stood
wide
open
i
could
plainly
see
its
terrible
fangs
and
poison
glands
then
holding
its
head
close
up
to
his
lips
he
injected
the
dark
saliva
into
its
throat
and
once
more
flung
it
to
the
ground
up
to
this
time
he
had
used
no
violence
nothing
that
would
have
killed
a
creature
so
retentive
of
life
as
a
snake
and
i
still
expected
to
see
the
reptile
make
its
escape
not
so
however
it
made
no
effort
to
move
from
the
spot
but
lay
stretched
out
in
loose
irregular
folds
without
any
perceptible
motion
beyond
a
slight
quivering
of
the
body
in
less
than
two
minutes
after
this
motion
ceased
and
the
snake
had
all
the
appearance
of
being
dead
it
am
dead
mass
replied
the
black
to
my
inquiring
glance
dead
as
julium
caesar
and
what
is
this
plant
gabriel
ah
dat
is
a
great
yerb
mass
dat
is
a
scace
plant
a
berry
scace
plant
eat
some
ob
dat
no
snake
bite
you
as
you
jes
seed
dat
is
de
plant
ob
de
the
botanical
knowledge
of
my
sable
companion
went
no
farther
in
after
years
however
i
was
enabled
to
classify
his
charm
which
was
no
other
than
the
a
species
closely
allied
to
the
bejuco
de
guaco
that
alexipharmic
rendered
so
celebrated
by
the
pens
of
mutis
and
humboldt
my
companion
now
desired
me
to
chew
some
of
the
roots
for
though
he
had
every
confidence
in
the
other
remedy
he
deemed
it
no
harm
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
he
extolled
the
virtues
of
the
plant
and
told
me
he
should
have
administered
it
instead
of
the
seneca
root
but
he
had
despaired
of
finding
it
as
it
was
of
much
more
rare
occurrence
in
that
part
of
the
country
i
eagerly
complied
with
his
request
and
swallowed
some
of
the
juice
like
the
seneca
root
it
tasted
hot
and
pungent
with
something
of
the
flavour
of
spirits
of
camphor
but
the
polygala
is
quite
inodorous
while
the
guaco
gives
forth
a
strong
aromatic
smell
resembling
valerian
i
had
already
experienced
relief
this
would
have
given
it
to
me
almost
instantaneously
in
a
very
short
time
time
the
swelling
completely
subsided
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
binding
around
my
wrist
i
should
have
forgotten
that
i
had
been
wounded
chapter
thirty
seven
killing
a
trail
an
hour
or
more
we
had
spent
since
entering
the
glade
now
no
longer
terrible
once
more
its
flowers
looked
bright
and
their
perfume
had
recovered
its
sweetness
once
more
the
singing
of
the
birds
and
the
hum
of
the
fell
soothingly
upon
my
ears
and
there
as
before
sat
the
pretty
doves
still
repeating
their
soft
the
endearing
expression
of
their
loves
i
could
have
lingered
long
in
the
midst
of
this
fair
scene
long
have
enjoyed
its
sylvan
beauty
but
the
intellectual
must
over
yield
to
the
physical
i
felt
sensations
of
hunger
and
soon
the
appetite
began
to
distress
me
where
was
i
to
obtain
relief
from
this
pain
where
obtain
food
i
could
not
ask
my
companion
to
guide
me
to
the
plantations
now
that
i
knew
the
risk
he
would
run
in
so
doing
i
knew
that
it
really
was
as
he
had
stated
loss
of
an
arm
perhaps
of
life
should
he
be
there
was
but
little
hope
of
mercy
for
him
the
less
so
as
he
had
no
master
with
power
to
protect
him
and
who
might
be
in
his
not
being
thus
crippled
by
approaching
the
open
country
on
the
edge
of
the
clearings
he
would
not
only
run
the
hazard
of
being
seen
but
what
he
feared
still
more
being
by
this
mode
of
searching
for
runaways
was
not
uncommon
and
there
were
even
white
men
base
enough
to
follow
it
as
a
calling
so
learnt
i
from
my
companion
his
information
was
afterwards
confirmed
my
own
i
was
hungry
what
was
to
be
done
i
could
not
find
my
way
alone
i
might
again
get
lost
and
have
to
spend
the
night
in
the
swamp
what
had
i
best
do
i
appealed
to
my
companion
he
had
been
silent
for
some
time
busy
with
his
thoughts
they
were
running
on
the
same
subject
as
my
own
the
brave
fellow

not
forgotten

reptile
while
he
was
talking
and
having
pinned
neck
and
tail
together
with
a
sharp
stick
he
lifted
the
glittering
body
and
flinging
it
over
his
shoulders
stood
ready
to
depart
come
now
mass
continued
he
come
wi
ole
gabe
he
find
you
somethin
to
eat
so
saying
he
turned
round
and
walked
off
into
the
bushes
i
took
up
my
gun
and
followed
i
could
not
do
better
to
have
attempted
to
find
my
own
way
back
to
the
clearings
might
again
have
resulted
in
failure
since
i
had
twice
failed
i
had
nothing
to
hurry
me
back
it
would
be
quite
as
well
if
i
returned
to
the
village
after
night
the
more
prudent
course
in
fact
as
then
my
and
habiliments
would
be
less
likely
to
attract
attention
and
this
i
desired
to
avoid
i
was
contented
therefore
to
follow
the
runaway
to
his
lair
and
share
it
with
him
till
after
sunset
for
some
hundred
yards
he
led
on
in
silence
his
eyes
wandered
around
the
forest
as
though
he
was
seeking
for
something
they
were
not
directed
upon
the
ground
but
upward
to
the
trees
and
therefore
i
know
it
was
not
the
path
he
was
in
search
of
a
slight
exclamation
escaped
him
and
suddenly
turning
in
his
tracks
he
struck
off
in
a
direction
different
to
that
we
had
been
following
i
walked
after
and
now
saw
that
he
had
halted
by
a
tall
tree
and
was
looking
up
among
its
branches
the
tree
was
the
frankincense
or
loblolly
pine
that
much
of
botany
i
knew
i
could
tell
the
species
by
the
large
spinous
cones
and
needles
why
had
he
stopped
there
mass
edwad
soon
see
he
said
in
answer
to
my
interrogatory
please
mass
he
continued
hold
de
snake
a
bit
do
let
um
touch
de
groun
dam
dogs
dey
smell
um
i
relieved
him
of
his
burden
and
holding
it
as
he
desired
stood
watching
him
in
silence
the
loblolly
pine
grows
with
a
straight
naked
shaft
and
pyramidal
head
often
without
branches
to
the
height
of
fifty
feet
in
this
case
however
several
fronds
stood
out
from
the
trunk
at
less
than
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
these
were
loaded
with
large
green
cones
full
five
inches
in
length
and
it
appeared
to
be
these
that
my
companion
desired
to
obtain
though
for
what
purpose
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
after
a
while
he
procured
a
long
pole
and
with
the
end
of
this
knocked
down
several
of
the
cones
along
with
pieces
of
the
branchlets
to
which
they
adhered
as
soon
as
he
believed
he
had
a
sufficient
quantity
for
his
purpose
he
desisted
and
flung
the
pole
away
what
next
i
watched
with
increasing
interest
he
now
gathered
up
both
the
cones
and
the
adhering
spray
but
to
my
surprise
he
flung
the
former
away
it
was
not
the
cones
then
he
wanted
but
the
young
shoots
that
grew
on
the
very
tops
of
the
branches
these
were
of
a
colour
and
thickly
coated
with
resin
for
the
is
more
resinous
than
any
tree
of
its
kind
emitting
a
strong
aromatic
odour
which
has
given
to
it
one
of
its
trivial
names
having
collected
the
shoots
until
he
had
both
hands
full
my
guide
now
bent
down
and
rubbed
the
resin
over
both
the
soles
and
upper
surface
of
his
coarse
brogans
he
then
advanced
to
where
i
stood
stooped
down
again
and
treated
my
boots
to
a
similar
polishing
now
mass
all
right
de
dam
no
scent
ole
gabe
now
dat
de
come
mass
edwad
come
saying
this
he
again
shouldered
the
snake
and
started
off
leaving
me
to
follow
in
his
tracks
chapter
thirty
eight
the
pirogue
we
soon
after
entered
the
there
the
surface
was
mostly
without
underwood
the
black
taxodiums
standing
thickly
usurped
the
ground
their
umbellated
crowns
covered
with
hoary
epiphytes
whose
pendulous
drapery
shut
out
the
sun
that
would
otherwise
have
nourished
on
that
rich
soil
a
luxuriant
herbaceous
vegetation
but
we
were
now
within
the
limits
of
the
annual
inundation
and
but
few
plants
can
thrive
there
after
a
while
i
could
see
we
were
approaching
a
stagnant
water
there
was
no
perceptible
descent
but
the
dank
damp
odour
of
the
swamp
the
noise
of
the
piping
frogs
the
occasional
scream
of
some
wading
bird
or
the
bellowing
of
the
alligator
admonished
me
that
some
constant
water
some
lake
or
pond
was
near
we
were
soon
upon
its
margin
it
was
a
large
pond
though
only
a
small
portion
of
it
came
under
the
eye
for
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
grew
up
out
of
the
water
their
huge
buttresses
spreading
out
so
as
almost
to
touch
each
other
here
and
there
the
black
knees
protruded
above
the
surface
their
fantastic
shapes
suggesting
the
idea
of
horrid
and
lending
a
supernatural
character
to
the
scene
thus
canopied
over
the
water
looked
black
as
ink
and
the
atmosphere
felt
heavy
and
oppressive
the
picture
was
one
from
which
dante
might
have
drawn
ideas
for
his
inferno
on
arriving
near
this
gloomy
pond
my
guide
came
to
a
stop
a
huge
tree
that
had
once
stood
near
the
edge
had
fallen
and
in
such
a
position
that
its
top
extended
far
out
into
the
water
its
branches
were
yet
undecayed
and
the
parasites
still
clung
to
them
in
thick
tufts
giving
the
whole
the
appearance
of
a
mass
of
hay
loosely
thrown
together
part
of
this
was
under
water
but
a
still
larger
portion
remained
above
the
surface
high
and
dry
it
was
at
the
root
of
this
fallen
tree
that
my
guide
had
halted
he
remained
but
a
moment
waiting
only
till
i
came
up
as
soon
as
i
had
reached
the
spot
he
mounted
upon
the
trunk
and
beckoning
me
to
follow
him
walked
along
the
log
in
the
direction
of
its
top
i
climbed
up
and
balancing
myself
as
well
as
i
could
followed
him
out
into
the
water
on
reaching
the
head
of
the
tree
we
entered
among
the
thick
limbs
and
winding
around
these
kept
still
farther
towards
the
top
branches
i
expected
that
there
we
should
reach
our
at
length
my
companion
came
to
a
stop
and
i
now
saw
to
my
astonishment
a
small
pirogue
resting
upon
the
water
and
hidden
under
the
moss
so
completely
was
it
concealed
that
it
was
not
possible
to
have
seen
it
from
any
point
except
that
where
we
now
stood
this
then
thought
i
is
the
object
for
which
we
have
crawled
out
upon
the
tree
the
sight
of
the
pirogue
led
me
to
conjecture
that
we
had
farther
to
go
the
black
now
loosed
the
canoe
from
its
moorings
and
beckoned
me
to
get
in
i
stepped
into
the
frail
craft
and
sat
down
my
companion
followed
and
laying
hold
of
the
branches
impelled
the
vessel
outward
till
it
was
clear
of
the
tops
of
the
tree
then
seizing
the
paddle
under
its
repeated
strokes
we
passed
silently
over
the
gloomy
surface
of
the
water
for
the
first
two
or
three
hundred
yards
our
progress
was
but
slow
the
cypress
knees
and
huge
buttocks
of
the
trees
stood
thickly
in
the
way
and
it
was
necessary
to
observe
some
caution
in
working
the
pirogue
through
among
them
but
i
saw
that
my
companion
well
understood
the
of
his
craft
and
wielded
a
paddle
with
the
skill
of
a
chippewa
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
and
bayou
fisherman
and
in
these
pursuits
no
doubt
he
had
picked
up
his
it
was
the
most
singular
voyage
i
had
ever
made
the
pirogue
floated
in
an
element
that
more
resembled
ink
than
water
not
a
ray
of
sun
glanced
across
our
path
the
darkness
of
twilight
was
above
and
around
us
we
glided
along
shadowy
aisles
and
amidst
huge
black
trunks
that
rose
like
columns
supporting
a
canopy
of
fronds
from
this
vegetable
root
hung
the
mournful
sometimes
drooping
down
to
the
very
surface
of
the
water
so
as
to
sweep
our
faces
and
shoulders
as
we
passed
under
it
we
were
not
the
only
living
things
even
this
hideous
place
had
its
denizens
it
was
the
haunt
and
secure
abode
of
the
great
whose
horrid
form
could
be
distinguished
in
the
gloom
now
crawling
along
some
prostrate
trunk
now
half
mounted
upon
the
protruding
knees
of
the
cypresses
or
swimming
with
slow
and
stealthy
stroke
through
the
black
liquid
huge
could
be
seen
causing
a
tiny
ripple
as
they
passed
from
tree
to
tree
or
lying
coiled
upon
the
projecting
buttocks
the
hovered
on
silent
wing
and
large
brown
bats
pursued
their
insect
prey
sometimes
these
came
near
fluttering
in
our
very
faces
so
that
we
could
perceive
the
mephitic
odour
of
their
bodies
while
their
horny
jaws
gave
forth
a
noise
like
the
clinking
of
castanets
the
novelty
of
the
scene
interested
me
but
i
could
not
help
being
impressed
with
a
slight
feeling
of
awe
classic
memories
too
stirred
within
me
the
fancies
of
the
roman
poet
were
here
realised
i
was
upon
the
styx
and
in
my
rower
i
recognised
the
redoubtable
charon
suddenly
a
light
broke
through
the
gloom
a
few
more
strokes
of
the
paddle
and
the
pirogue
shot
out
into
the
bright
sunlight
what
a
relief
i
now
beheld
a
space
of
open
water
a
sort
of
circular
lake
it
was
in
reality
the
lake
for
what
we
had
been
passing
over
was
but
the
inundation
and
at
certain
seasons
this
portion
covered
with
forest
became
almost
dry
the
open
water
on
the
contrary
was
constant
and
too
deep
even
for
the
cypress
to
grow
in
it
the
space
thus
clear
of
timber
was
not
of
very
large
extent
a
surface
of
or
so
on
all
sides
it
was
enclosed
by
the
forest
that
rose
around
it
like
a
grey
wall
and
in
the
very
centre
grew
a
clump
of
the
same
character
that
in
the
distance
appeared
to
be
an
island
this
solitary
tarn
was
far
from
being
silent
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
scene
of
stirring
life
it
seemed
the
rendezvous
for
the
many
species
of
wild
winged
creatures
that
people
the
great
of
louisiana
there
were
the
egrets
the
ibises
both
white
and
scarlet
the
various
species
of
the
cranes
and
the
red
flamingoes
there
too
was
the
singular
and
rare
darter
swimming
with
body
immersed
and
head
just
appearing
above
the
water
and
there
were
the
white
unwieldy
forms
of
the
tyrant
pelicans
standing
on
the
watch
for
their
finny
prey
swimming
birds
speckled
the
surface
various
species
of
swans
geese
and
ducks
while
the
air
was
filled
with
flights
of
gulls
and
curlews
or
was
cut
by
the
strong
whistling
wings
of
the
mallards
other
than
waterfowl
had
chosen
this
secluded
spot
for
their
favourite
the
osprey
could
be
seen
wheeling
about
in
the
air
now
shooting
down
like
a
star
upon
the
unfortunate
fish
that
had
approached
too
near
the
surface
and
anon
yielding
up
his
prey
to
the
tyrant
such
were
the
varied
forms
of
feathered
creatures
that
presented
themselves
to
my
eye
on
entering
this
lonely
lake
of
the
woods
i
looked
with
interest
upon
the
scene
it
was
a
true
scene
of
nature
and
made
a
vivid
impression
upon
me
at
the
moment
not
so
with
my
companion
to
whom
it
was
neither
novel
nor
interesting
it
was
an
old
picture
to
his
eyes
and
he
saw
it
from
a
different
point
of
view
he
did
not
stay
to
look
at
it
but
lightly
dipping
his
paddle
pressed
the
pirogue
on
in
the
direction
of
the
island
a
few
strokes
carried
us
across
the
open
water
and
the
canoe
once
more
entered
under
the
shadow
of
trees
but
to
my
surprise
was
no
what
i
had
taken
for
an
island
was
but
a
single
that
grew
upon
a
spot
where
the
lake
was
shallow
its
branches
extending
on
every
side
were
loaded
with
the
hoary
parasites
that
drooped
down
to
the
very
surface
of
the
water
and
shadowed
a
space
of
half
an
acre
in
extent
its
trunk
rested
upon
a
base
of
enormous
dimensions
huge
buttresses
flanked
it
on
every
side
slanting
out
into
the
water
and
rising
along
its
stem
to
a
height
of
many
yards
the
whole
mass
appearing
as
large
as
an
ordinary
cabin
its
sides
were
indented
with
deep
bays
and
as
we
approached
under
the
screen
i
could
perceive
a
dark
cavity
which
showed
that
this
singular
buttock
was
hollow
within
the
bow
of
the
pirogue
was
directed
into
one
of
the
bays
and
soon
struck
against
the
tree
i
saw
several
steps
cut
into
the
wood
and
leading
to
the
cavity
above
my
companion
pointed
to
these
steps
the
screaming
of
the
startled
birds
prevented
me
from
hearing
what
he
said
but
i
saw
that
it
was
a
sign
for
me
to
mount
upward
i
hastened
to
obey
his
direction
and
climbing
out
of
the
canoe
sprawled
up
the
sloping
ridge
at
the
top
was
the
entrance
just
large
enough
to
admit
the
body
of
a
man
and
pressing
through
this
i
stood
inside
the
hollow
tree
we
had
reached
our
destination
i
was
in
the
of
the
chapter
thirty
nine
the
the
interior
was
dark
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
distinguish
any
object
presently
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
sombre
light
and
i
was
enabled
to
trace
the
outlines
of
this
singular
its
dimensions
somewhat
astonished
me
a
dozen
men
could
have
been
accommodated
in
it
and
there
was
ample
room
for
that
number
either
sitting
or
standing
in
fact
the
whole
pyramidal
mass
which
supported
the
tree
was
nothing
more
than
a
thin
shell
all
the
heart
having
perished
by
decay
the
floor
by
the
falling
of
this
of
rotten
wood
was
raised
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
felt
firm
and
dry
underfoot
near
its
centre
i
could
perceive
the
ashes
and
embers
of
an
extinct
fire
and
along
one
side
was
strewed
a
thick
covering
of
dry
that
had
evidently
been
used
as
a
bed
an
old
blanket
lying
upon
the
moss
gave
further
testimony
that
this
was
its
purpose
there
was
no
furniture
a
rude
block
a
cypress
knee
that
had
been
carried
there
formed
the
only
substitute
for
a
chair
and
there
was
nothing
to
serve
for
a
table
he
who
had
made
this
singular
cave
his
residence
required
no
luxuries
to
sustain
him
necessaries
however
he
had
provided
as
my
eyes
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
light
i
could
make
out
a
number
of
objects
i
had
not
at
first
seen
an
earthen
a
large
water
gourd
a
tin
cup
an
old
axe
some
and
one
or
two
coarse
rags
of
clothing
what
interested
me
more
than
all
these
was
the
sight
of
several
articles
that
were
there
was
a
chunk
of
cooked
pork
a
gigantic
pone
of
several
boiled
ears
of
maize
and
the
better
half
of
a
roast
fowl
all
these
lay
together
upon
a
large
wooden
dish
rudely
carved
from
the
wood
of
the
of
such
a
fashion
as
i
had
often
observed
about
the
cabins
of
the
negro
quarter
beside
this
dish
lay
several
immense
bodies
of
colour
with
other
smaller
ones
of
a
yellow
hue
these
were
water
and
musk
melons
not
a
bad
prospect
for
a
dessert
i
had
made
this
reconnoissance
while
my
companion
was
engaged
in
fastening
his
pirogue
to
the
tree

had
finished
my

saying
he
set
the
wooden
platter
with
its
contents
before
me
and
the
conversation
was
now
interrupted
as
both
myself
and
my
companion
attacked
the
viands
with
right
the
millyuns
constituted
a
delicious
dessert
and
for
a
full
we
continued
to
fight
against
the
appetite
of
hunger
we
conquered
it
at
length
but
not
until
the
store
of
the
runaway
had
been
greatly
reduced
in
bulk
after
dinner
we
sat
conversing
for
a
long
time
we
were
not
without
the
soothing
nicotian
weed
my
companion
had
several
bunches
of
dry
among
his
stores
and
a
with
a
piece
of
served
for
a
pipe
through
which
the
smoke
was
inhaled
with
all
the
aromatic
fragrance
of
the
costliest
havanna
partly
from
gratitude
for
the
saving
of
my
life
i
had
grown
to
feel
a
strong
interest
in
the
runaway
and
his
future
prospects
became
the
subject
of
our
converse
he
had
formed
no
plan
of
escape
though
some
thoughts
of
an
attempt
to
reach
canada
or
mexico
or
to
get
off
in
a
ship
by
new
orleans
had
passed
through
his
mind
a
plan
occurred
to
me
though
i
did
not
communicate
it
to
him
as
i
might
never
be
able
to
carry
it
out
i
begged
of
him
however
not
to
leave
his
present
abode
until
i
could
see
him
again
promising
that
i
should
do
what
i
could
to
find
him
a
kinder
master
he
readily
agreed
to
my
proposal
and
as
it
was
now
sunset
i
made
preparations
for
my
departure
from
the
lake
a
signal
was
agreed
upon
so
that
when
i
should
return
to
visit
him
he
could
bring
the
pirogue
to
ferry
me
across
and
this
being
arranged
we
once
more
entered
the
canoe
and
set
out
for
the
plantations
we
soon
recrossed
the
lake
and
leaving
the
little
boat
safely
moored
by
the
fallen
tree
started
off
through
the
woods
the
path
with
gabriel
for
my
guide
was
now
easy
and
at
intervals
as
we
went
along
he
directed
my
attention
to
certain
blazes
upon
the
trees
and
other
marks
by
which
i
should
know
it
again
in
less
than
an
hour
after
we
parted
on
the
edge
of
the
clearings
he
going
to
some
rendezvous
already
appointed
whilst
i
kept
on
to
the
village
the
road
to
which
now
ran
between
parallel
fences
that
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
go
astray
chapter
forty
hotel
gossip
it
was
yet
early
when
i
entered
the
village
i
glided
stealthily
through
the
streets
desirous
to
avoid
observation
unfortunately
i
had
to
pass
through
the
bar
of
the
hotel
in
order
to
reach
my
room
it
was
just
before
the
hour
of
supper
and
the
guests
had
assembled
in
the
bar
saloon
and
around
the
porch
my
tattered
habiliments
in
places
stained
with
blood
and
profusely
soiled
with
mud
could
not
escape
notice
nor
did
they
men
turned
and
gazed
after
me
loiterers
looked
with
eyes
that
expressed
their
astonishment
some
in
the
portico
and
others
in
the
bar
hailed
me
as
i
passed
asking
me
where
i
had
been
to
one
cried
out
hillow
mister
you
had
a
tussle
with
the
cats
hai
you
i
did
not
make
reply
i
pushed
on
and
found
relief
in
the
privacy
of
my
chamber
i
had
been
badly
torn
by
the
bushes
my
wounds
needed
dressing
i
despatched
a
messenger
for
reigart
fortunately
he
was
at
home
and
in
a
few
minutes
followed
my
messenger
to
the
hotel
he
entered
my
room
and
stood
staring
at
me
with
a
look
of
surprise
my
dear
r
where
have
you
been
he
inquired
at
length
to
the
swamp
and
those
wounds
your
clothes
torn
blood
that
all
but
where
have
you
been
in
the
swamp
in
the
swamp
but
how
came
you
to
get
such
a
mauling
i
have
been
bitten
by
a
rattlesnake
what
bitten
by
a
rattlesnake
do
you
speak
seriously
quite
true
it
is
but
i
have
taken
the
antidote
i
am
cured
antidote
cured
and
what
cure
who
gave
you
an
antidote
a
friend
whom
i
met
in
the
swamp
a
friend
in
the
swamp
exclaimed
reigart
his
astonishment
increasing
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
necessity
of
keeping
my
secret
i
saw
that
i
had
spoken
imprudently
inquisitive
eyes
were
peeping
in
at
the
door
ears
were
listening
to
catch
every
sound
although
the
inhabitant
of
the
mississippi
is
by
no
means
of
a
curious
disposition
the
statements
of
gossiping
tourists
the
unexplained
and
forlorn
appearance
i
presented
on
my
return
was
enough
to
excite
a
degree
of
interest
even
among
the
most
apathetic
people
and
a
number
of
the
guests
of
the
hotel
had
gathered
in
the
lobby
around
the
door
of
my
chamber
and
were
eagerly
asking
each
other
what
had
happened
to
me
i
could
overhear
their
conversation
though
they
did
not
know
it
he
been
fightin
a
painter
said
one
interrogatively
a
painter
or
a
bar
answered
another
some
desprit
varmint
anyhow
it
hez
left
its
mark
on
him
that
it
hez
it
the
same
fellow
that
laid
out
bully
bill
ai
it
the
same
replied
some
one
english
ai
he
do
know
he
a
britisher
i
believe
english
irish
or
scotch
he
a
hull
team
an
a
cross
dog
under
the
wagon
by
god
he
laid
out
bully
bill
straight
as
a
wi
nothin
but
a
bit
o
a
whup
and
then
tuk
bill
pistols
away
from
him
ha
ha
ha
jehosophat
he
jest
a
feller
to
whip
his
weight
in
he
killed
the
catamount
i
reckon
no
doubt
he
done
that
i
had
supposed
that
my
encounter
with
bully
bill
had
made
me
enemies
among
his
class
it
was
evident
from
the
tone
and
tenor
of
their
conversation
that
such
was
not
the
case
though
perhaps
a
little
piqued
that
a
stranger
a
mere
youth
as
i
then
was
should
have
conquered
one
of
their
bullies
these
backwoodsmen
are
not
intensely
clannish
and
bully
bill
was
no
favourite
had
i
whipped
him
on
any
other
grounds
i
should
have
gained
a
positive
popularity
by
the
act
but
in
defence
of
a
slave
and
i
a
foreigner
a
britisher
too
that
was
a
presumption
not
to
be
pardoned
that
was
the
drawback
on
my
victory
and
henceforth
i
was
likely
to
be
a
marked
man
in
the
neighbourhood
these
observations
had
served
to
amuse
me
while
i
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
reigart
though
up
to
a
certain
point
i
took
but
little
interest
in
them
a
remark
that
now
reached
my
ears
however
suddenly
changed
the
nature
of
my
thoughts
it
was
this
after
miss
besancon
they
i
was
now
interested
i
stepped
to
the
door
and
placing
my
ear
close
to
the
keyhole
listened
i
guess
he
arter
said
another
and
the
remark
was
followed
by
a
significant
laugh
well
then
rejoined
a
voice
in
a
more
solemn
and
emphatic
tone
he
after
what
he
wo
get
how
how
demanded
several
he
may
get
lady
preehaps
continued
the
same
voice
in
the
same
measured
tones
but
not
plantation
how
what
do
you
mean
mr
moxley
again
demanded
the
chorus
of
voices
i
mean
what
i
say
gentlemen
replied
the
solemn
speaker
and
then
repeated
again
his
former
words
in
a
like
measured
drawl
he
may
get
the
lady
but
not
plantation
oh
the
report
true
then
said
another
voice
interrogatively
insolvent
eh
old
gayarre
owns
plantation
and
niggers
every
skin
o
them
the
sheriff
will
take
possession
a
murmur
of
astonishment
reached
my
ears
it
was
mingled
with
expressions
of
disapprobation
or
sympathy
poor
girl
it
a
pity
o
well
it
no
wonder
she
made
the
money
fly
since
the
old
died
some
say
he
did
leave
so
much
after
all
most
part
mortgaged
before
the
entrance
of
the
doctor
interrupted
this
conversation
and
relieved
me
for
the
moment
from
the
torture
which
it
was
inflicting
upon
me
a
friend
in
the
swamp
did
you
say
again
interrogated
reigart
i
had
hesitated
to
reply
thinking
of
the
crowd
by
the
door
i
said
to
the
doctor
in
a
low
earnest
voice
my
dear
friend
i
have
met
with
an
adventure
am
badly
scratched
as
you
see
dress
my
wounds
but
do
not
press
me
for
details
i
have
my
reasons
for
being
silent
you
will
one
day
learn
all
but
not
now
therefore
enough
enough
said
the
doctor
interrupting
me
do
not
be
uneasy
let
me
look
at
your
scratches
the
good
doctor
became
silent
and
proceeded
to
the
dressing
of
my
wounds
under
other
circumstances
the
manipulation
of
my
wounds
for
they
now
felt
painful
might
have
caused
me
annoyance
it
did
not
then
what
i
had
just
heard
had
produced
a
feeling
within
that
neutralised
the
external
pain
and
i
felt
it
not
i
was
really
in
mental
agony
i
burned
with
impatience
to
question
reigart
about
the
affairs
of
the
plantation
about
eugenie
and
aurore
i
could
not
we
were
not
alone
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
and
a
negro
attendant
had
entered
the
room
and
were
assisting
the
doctor
in
his
operations
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
in
their
presence
i
was
forced
to
nurse
my
impatience
until
all
was
over
and
both
landlord
and
servant
had
left
us
now
doctor
this
news
of
mademoiselle
besancon
do
not
know
all
only
what
i
have
heard
this
moment
from
those
gossips
outside
the
room
i
detailed
to
reigart
the
remarks
that
had
been
made
really
i
thought
you
must
have
been
acquainted
with
the
whole
matter
i
had
fancied
that
to
be
the
cause
of
your
long
absence
though
i
did
not
even
conjecture
how
you
might
be
engaged
in
the
matter
i
know
nothing
more
than
what
i
have
thus
accidentally
overheard
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
all
is
it
true
substantially
true
i
grieve
to
say
poor
eugenie
the
estate
was
heavily
mortgaged
to
gayarre
i
have
long
suspected
this
and
fear
there
has
been
some
foul
play
gayarre
has
foreclosed
the
mortgage
and
indeed
it
is
said
is
already
in
possession
everything
is
now
his
everything
everything
upon
the
plantation
the
slaves
certainly
all
all
and
and
aurore
i
hesitated
as
i
put
the
interrogatory
reigart
had
no
knowledge
of
my
attachment
to
aurore
the
quadroon
girl
you
mean
of
course
she
with
the
others
she
is
but
a
slave
like
the
rest
she
will
be
sold
a
slave
sold
with
the
this
reflection
was
not
uttered
aloud
i
can
not
describe
the
tumult
of
my
feelings
as
i
listened
the
blood
was
boiling
within
my
veins
and
i
could
scarce
restrain
myself
from
some
wild
expression
i
strove
to
the
utmost
to
hide
my
thoughts
but
scarce
succeeded
for
i
noticed
that
the
usually
cold
eye
of
reigart
was
kindled
in
surprise
at
my
manner
if
he
divined
my
secret
he
was
generous
for
he
asked
no
explanation
the
slaves
are
all
to
be
sold
then
i
faltered
out
no
doubt
everything
will
be
sold
that
is
the
law
in
such
cases
it
is
likely
gayarre
will
buy
in
the
whole
estate
as
the
plantation
lies
contiguous
to
his
own
gayarre
villain
oh
and
mademoiselle
besancon
what
will
become
of
her
has
she
no
friends
i
have
heard
something
of
an
aunt
who
has
some
though
not
much
property
she
lives
in
the
city
it
is
likely
that
mademoiselle
will
live
with
her
in
future
i
believe
the
aunt
has
no
children
of
her
own
and
eugenie
will
inherit
this
however
i
can
not
vouch
for
i
know
it
only
as
a
rumour
reigart
spoke
these
words
in
a
cautious
and
reserved
manner
i
noticed
something
peculiar
in
the
tone
in
which
he
uttered
them
but
i
knew
his
reason
for
being
cautious
he
was
under
a
mistaken
impression
as
to
the
feelings
with
which
i
regarded
eugenie
i
did
not
undeceive
him
poor
eugenie
a
double
sorrow
no
wonder
at
the
change
i
had
observed
of
late
no
wonder
she
appeared
sad
all
this
was
but
my
own
silent
reflections
doctor
said
i
elevating
my
voice
i
must
go
to
the
plantation
not
now
my
dear
mr
you
must
not
why
it
is
impossible
i
can
not
permit
it
you
will
have
a
fever
it
may
cost
you
your
life
but
i
can
not
hear
you
i
assure
you
you
are
now
on
the
verge
of
a
fever
you
must
remain
in
your
room
at
least
until
perhaps
then
you
may
go
out
with
safety
now
it
is
impossible
i
was
compelled
to
acquiesce
though
i
am
not
certain
but
that
had
i
taken
my
own
way
it
would
have
been
better
for
my
fever
within
me
was
a
of
much
stronger
than
any
exposure
to
the
night
air
my
throbbing
heart
and
blood
soon
acted

my
brain

chapter

one
the
letter
during
all
the
night
my
sleep
was
broken
at
intervals
and
the
hours
divided
between
dreaming
and
half
delirium
i
awoke
in
the
morning
not
much
refreshed
with
my
night
rest
i
lay
for
some
time
passing
over
in
my
mind
the
occurrences
of
yesterday
and
considering
what
course
i
should
pursue
after
a
time
i
determined
upon
going
direct
to
the
plantation
and
learning
for
myself
how
matters
stood
there
i
arose
with
this
intention
as
i
was
dressing
my
eye
fell
upon
a
letter
that
lay
upon
the
table
it
bore
no
postmark
but
the
writing
was
in
a
female
hand
and
i
guessed
whence
it
came
i
tore
open
the
seal
and
read
by
the
laws
of
louisiana
i
am
a
woman
and
none
more
unhappy
in
all
the
land
the
same
sun
that
has
risen
upon
the
natal
day
of
my
majority
looks
down
upon
the
ruin
of
my
was
my
design
to
have
you
to
have
proved
that
i
am
not
ungrateful
alas
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
i
am
no
more
the
proprietor
of
the
plantation
more
the
mistress
of
aurore
all
is
gone
from
me
and
eugenie
besancon
is
now
a
beggar
ah
monsieur
it
is
a
sad
tale
and
i
know
not
what
will
be
its
there
are
griefs
harder
to
hear
than
the
loss
of
fortune
that
may
in
time
be
repaired
but
the
anguish
of
unrequited
strong
and
single
and
pure
as
mine
long
endure
perchance
for
monsieur
that
in
the
bitter
cup
it
is
my
destiny
to
drink
there
is
not
one
drop
of
jealousy
or
reproach
i
alone
have
made
the
misery
that
is
my
monsieur
adieu
and
farewell
it
is
better
we
should
never
meet
again
o
be
happy
no
plaint
of
mine
shall
ever
reach
your
ear
to
cloud
the
sunshine
of
your
happiness
henceforth
the
walls
sacre
coeur
alone
witness
the
sorrows
of
the
unfortunate
but
eugenie
the
letter
was
dated
the
day
before
i
knew
that
that
was
the
birthday
of
the
writer
in
common
parlance
the
day
on
which
she
was
of
age
poor
eugenie
reflected
i
her
happiness
has
ended
with
her
girlhood
poor
eugenie
the
tears
ran
fast
over
my
cheeks
as
i
finished
reading
i
swept
them
hastily
away
and
ringing
the
bell
i
ordered
my
horse
to
be
saddled
i
hurried
through
with
my
toilet
the
horse
was
soon
brought
to
the
door
and
mounting
him
i
rode
rapidly
for
the
plantation
shortly
after
leaving
the
village
i
passed
two
men
who
were
also
on
horseback
going
in
the
same
direction
as
myself
but
riding
at
a
slower
pace
than
i
they
were
dressed
in
the
customary
style
of
planters
and
a
casual
observer
might
have
taken
them
for
such
there
was
something
about
them
however
that
led
me
to
think
they
were
not
planters
nor
merchants
nor
men
whose
calling
relates
to
any
of
the
ordinary
industries
of
life
it
was
not
in
their
dress
i
saw
this
something
but
in
a
certain
expression
of
countenance
this
expression
i
can
not
well
describe
but
i
have
ever
noticed
it
in
the
faces
and
features
of
men
who
have
anything
to
do
with
the
execution
of
the
laws
even
in
america
where
distinctive
costume
and
badge
are
absent
i
have
been
struck
with
this
peculiarity
so
much
so
that
i
believe
i
could
detect
a
detective
in
the
plainest
clothes
the
two
men
in
question
had
this
expression
strongly
marked
i
had
no
doubt
they
were
in
some
way
connected
with
the
execution
of
the
laws
i
had
no
doubt
they
were
constables
or
sheriff
officers
with
such
a
slight
glance
as
i
gave
to
them
in
passing
i
might
not
have
troubled
myself
with
this
conjecture
had
it
not
been
for
other
circumstances
then
in
my
thoughts
i
had
not
saluted
these
men
but
as
i
passed
i
could
perceive
that
my
presence
was
not
without
interest
to
them
on
glancing
back
i
saw
that
one
of
them
had
ridden
close
up
to
the
other
that
they
were
conversing
earnestly
and
from
their
gestures
i
could
tell
that
i
was
the
subject
of
their
talk
i
had
soon
ridden
far
ahead
and
ceased
to
think
any
more
about
them
i
had
hurried
forward
without
any
preconceived
plan
of
action
i
had
acted
altogether
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
and
thought
only
of
reaching
the
house
and
ascertaining
the
state
of
affairs
either
from
eugenie
or
aurore
herself
thus
i
had
reached
the
borders
of
the
plantation
it
now
occurred
to
me
to
ride
more
slowly
in
oder
to
gain
a
few
moments
to
manage
my
thoughts
i
even
halted
awhile
there
was
a
slight
bend
in
the
and
the
road
crossed
this
like
a
chord
to
its
arc
the
part
cut
off
was
a
piece
of
waste
a
common
and
as
there
was
no
fence
i
forsook
the
road
and
walked
my
horse
out
on
the
there
i
drew
up
but
remained
seated
in
my
saddle
i
endeavoured
to
sketch
out
some
plan
of
action
what
should
i
say
to
eugenie
what
to
aurore
would
the
former
see
me
after
what
she
had
written
in
her
note
she
had
said
farewell
but
it
was
not
a
time
to
stand
upon
punctilious
ceremony
and
if
not
should
i
find
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
aurore
i
see
who
should
prevent
me
i
had
much
to
say
to
her
my
heart
was
full
nothing
but
an
interview
with
my
betrothed
could
relieve
it
still
without
any
definite
plan
i
once
more
turned
my
horse
head
down
the
river
used
the
spur
and
galloped
onward
on
arriving
near
the
gate
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
two
saddled
horses
standing
there
i
instantly
recognised
them
as
the
horses
i
had
passed
on
the
road
they
had
overtaken
me
again
while
i
was
halted
by
the
bend
of
the
river
and
had
arrived
at
the
gate
before
me
the
saddles
were
now
empty
the
riders
had
gone
into
the
house
a
black
man
was
holding
the
horses
it
was
my
old
friend
zip
i
rode
up
and
without
dismounting
addressed
myself
to
scipio
who
were
they
who
had
gone
in
i
was
hardly
surprised
at
the
answer
my
conjecture
was
right
they
were
men
of
the
law
the
deputy
sheriff
of
the
and
his
assistant
it
was
scarce
necessary
to
inquire
their
i
guessed
that
i
only
asked
scipio
the
details
briefly
scipio
gave
them
at
least
so
far
as
i
allowed
him
to
proceed
without
interruption
a
sheriff
officer
was
in
charge
of
the
house
and
all
its
contents
larkin
still
ruled
the
negro
quarter
but
the
slaves
were
all
to
be
sold
gayarre
was
back
and
forward
and
am
gone
gone
away
and
whither
do
know
she
gone
to
de
city
she
leab
last
night
in
de
and
i
hesitated
a
moment
till
my
heart
should
still
its
heavy
throbbings
aurore
i
interrogated
with
an
effort
gone
too
she
gone
long
wi
missa
aurore
gone
yes
she
gone
daat
de
troof
i
was
astounded
by
the
information
as
well
as
puzzled
by
this
mysterious
departure
eugenie
gone
and
in
the
night
aurore
gone
with
her
what
could
it
mean
whither
had
they
gone
my
reiterated
appeal
to
the
black
threw
no
light
upon
the
subject
he
was
ignorant
of
all
their
movements
ignorant
of
everything
but
what
related
to
the
negro
quarter
he
had
heard
that
himself
his
wife
his
daughter
the
leetle
chloe
with
all
their
were
to
be
carried
down
to
the
city
and
to
be
sold
in
the
by
auction
they
were
to
be
taken
the
following
day
they
were
already
advertised
that
was
all
he
knew
no
not
all
one
other
piece
of
information
he
had
in
store
for
me
it
was
authentic
he
had
heard
the
white
folks
talk
of
it
to
one
another
larkin
gayarre
and
a
who
was
to
be
concerned
in
this
sale
it
regarded
the
quadroon
was
to
be
sold
among
the
the
blood
boiled
in
my
veins
as
the
black
imparted
this
information
it
was
authentic
scipio
statement
of
what
he
had
heard
minutely
detailed
bore
the
internal
evidence
of
authenticity
i
could
not
doubt
the
report
i
felt
the
conviction
that
it
was
true
the
plantation
besancon
had
no
more
attractions
i
had
no
longer
any
business
at
bringiers
new
orleans
was
now
the
scene
of
action
for
me
with
a
kind
word
to
scipio
i
wheeled
my
horse
and
galloped
away
from
the
gate
the
fiery
animal
caught
my
excitement
and
sprang
wildly
along
the
road
it
required
all
his
buoyant
spirit
to
keep
pace
with
the
quick
dancing
of
my
nerves
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
consigned
him
to
his
groom
and
climbing
to
my
chamber
commenced
preparing
for
my
departure
chapter
forty
two
the
i
now
only
waited
a
boat
to
convey
me
to
new
orleans
i
knew
that
i
should
not
have
long
to
wait
the
annual
epidemic
was
on
the
decline
and
the
season
of
business
and
pleasure
in
the
crescent
city
was
about
commencing
already
the
steamers
were
afloat
on
all
the
tributary
streams
of
the
mighty
mississippi
laden
with
the
produce
of
its
almost
limitless
valley
and
converging
towards
the
great
southern
entrepot
of
american
commerce
i
might
expect
a
every
day
or
rather
indeed
every
hour
i
resolved
to
take
the
first
boat
that
came
along
the
hotel
in
which
i
dwelt
as
well
as
the
whole
village
stood
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
boat
landing
it
had
been
built
so
from
precaution
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
at
this
place
and
for
a
thousand
miles
above
and
below
are
elevated
but
a
few
feet
above
the
surface
level
of
its
water
and
in
consequence
of
the
continuous
detrition
it
is
no
uncommon
occurrence
for
large
slips
to
give
way
and
be
swept
off
in
the
red
whirling
current
it
might
be
supposed
that
in
time
this
action
of
the
water
would
widen
the
stream
to
unnatural
dimensions
but
no
for
every
encroachment
on
one
bank
there
is
a
corresponding
formation
against
the
opposite
a
deposit
caused
by
the
eddy
which
the
new
curve
has
produced
so
that
the
river
thus
preserves
its
original
breadth
this
remarkable
action
may
be
noted
from
the
of
the
ohio
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
itself
though
at
certain
points
the
extent
of
the
encroachment
and
the
formation
that
neutralises
it
is
much
greater
than
at
others
in
some
places
the
wearing
away
of
the
bank
operates
so
rapidly
that
in
a
few
days
the
whole
site
of
a
village
or
even
a
plantation
may
disappear
not
unfrequently
too
during
the
high
this
eccentric
stream
takes
a
near
cut
across
the
neck
of
one
of
its
own
bends
and
in
a
few
hours
a
channel
is
formed
through
which
pours
the
whole
current
of
the
river
perhaps
a
plantation
may
have
been
established
in
the
concavity
of
this
bend
perhaps
three
or
four
of
them
and
the
planter
who
has
gone
to
sleep
under
the
full
belief
that
he
had
built
his
house
upon
a
awakes
in
the
morning
to
find
himself
the
inhabitant
of
an
island
with
dismay
he
beholds
the
vast
volume
of
water
rolling
past
and
cutting
off
his
communication
with
the
mainland
he
can
no
longer
ride
to
his
neighbouring
village
without
the
aid
of
an
expensive
ferry
his
wagons
will
no
longer
serve
him
to
haul
to
market
his
huge
or
hogsheads
of
sugar
and
tobacco
and
prompted
by
a
feeling
of
insecurity
lest
the
next
wild
sweep
of
the
current
may
carry
himself
his
house
and
his
several
hundred
negroes
along
with
it
he
flees
from
his
home
and
retires
to
some
other
part
of
the
stream
where
he
may
deem
the
land
in
less
danger
of
such
unwelcome
intrusion
in
consequence
of
these
eccentricities
a
safe
site
for
a
town
is
extremely
rare
upon
the
lower
mississippi
there
are
but
few
points
in
the
last
five
hundred
miles
of
its
course
where
natural
elevations
offer
this
advantage
the
artificial
embankment
known
as
the
levee
has
in
some
measure
remedied
the
deficiency
and
rendered
the
towns
and
plantations
secure
as
already
stated
my
hotel
was
somewhat
out
of
the
way
a
boat
might
touch
at
the
landing
and
be
off
again
without
my
being
warned
of
it
a
already
laden
and
not
caring
to
obtain
further
freight
would
not
stop
long
and
in
a
tavern
upon
the
mississippi
you
must
not
confide
in
the
punctuality
of
boots
as
you
would
in
a
london
hotel
your
chances
of
being
waked
by
sambo
ten
times
sleepier
than
yourself
are
scarcely
one
in
a
hundred
i
had
ample
experience
of
this
and
fearing
that
the
boat
might
pass
if
i
remained
at
the
hotel
i
came
to
the
resolve
to
settle
my
affairs
in
that
quarter
and
at
once
transport
myself
and
my
to
the
landing
i
should
not
be
entirely
without
shelter
there
was
no
house
but
an
old
steamboat
long
since
condemned
as
not
lay
at
the
landing
this
hulk
moored
by
strong
cables
to
the
bank
formed
an
excellent
floating
wharf
while
its
spacious
deck
cabins
and
saloons
served
as
a
storehouse
for
all
sorts
of
merchandise
it
was
in
fact
used
both
as
a
landing
and
warehouse
and
was
known
as
the
it
was
late
nearly
midnight
as
i
stepped
aboard
the
stragglers
from
the
town
who
may
have
had
business
there
had
all
gone
away
and
the
owner
of
the
was
himself
absent
a
drowsy
negro
his
was
the
only
human
thing
that
offered
itself
to
my
eyes
the
lower
deck
of
the
boat
was
tenanted
by
this
individual
who
sat
behind
a
counter
that
enclosed
one
corner
of
the
apartment
upon
this
counter
stood
a
pair
of
scales
with
weights
a
large
ball
of
coarse
twine
a
rude
knife
and
such
other
implements
as
may
be
seen
in
a
country
store
and
upon
shelves
at
the
back
were
ranged
bottles
of
coloured
liquors
glasses
boxes
of
hard
biscuit
western
reserve
cheeses
kegs
of
rancid
butter
plugs
of
tobacco
and
bundles
of
inferior
cigars
in
short
all
the
etceteras
of
a
regular
grocery
the
remaining
portion
of
the
ample
room
was
littered
with
merchandise
packed
in
various
forms
there
were
boxes
barrels
bags
and
bales
some
on
their
way
that
had
come
by
new
orleans
from
distant
lands
while
others
were
destined
downward
the
rich
product
of
the
soil
to
be
borne
thousands
of
miles
over
the
wide
atlantic
with
these
various
packages
every
part
of
the
floor
was
occupied
and
i
looked
in
vain
for
a
spot
on
which
to
stretch
myself
a
better
light
might
have
enabled
me
to
discover
such
a
place
but
the
tallow
candle
guttering
down
the
sides
of
an
empty
but
dimly
lit
up
the
confusion
it
just
sufficed
to
guide
me
to
the
only
occupant
of
the
place
upon
whose
sombre
face
the
light
faintly
flickered
asleep
uncle
i
said
approaching
him
a
gruff
reply
from
an
american
negro
is
indeed
a
rarity
and
never
given
to
a
question
politely
put
the
familiar
style
of
my
address
touched
a
sympathetic
chord
in
the
bosom
of
the
darkie
and
a
smile
of
satisfaction
gleamed
upon
his
features
as
he
made
answer
of
course
he
was
asleep
but
my
idle
question
was
only
meant
as
the
prelude
to
further
discourse
ah

eyes

the
satisfaction

experienced
at
the
sight
of
the
shining
piece
of
metal
without
more
ado
he
seized
the
that
hold
the
candle
and
gliding
among
the
boxes
and
bales
conducted
me
to
a
stairway

led
to

and
so
saying
the
black
set
the
upon
the
floor
and
passing
down
the
stair
again
left
me
to
my
reflections
with
such
poor
light
as
the
candle
afforded
i
took
a
careless
survey
of
my
apartment
there
was
plenty
of
room
as
uncle
sam
had
said
it
was
the
cabin
of
the
old
steamboat
and
as
the
had
been
broken
off
and
carried
away
the
ladies
cabin
main
saloon
and
front
were
now
all
in
one
together
they
formed
a
hall
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
length
and
from
where
i
stood
near
the
centre
both
ends
were
lost
to
my
view
in
the
darkness
the
on
each
side
were
still
there
with
their
green
venetian
doors
some
of
these
were
shut
while
others
stood
ajar
or
quite
open
the
gilding
and
ornaments
dim
from
age
and
use
adorned
the
sides
and
ceiling
of
the
hall
and
over
the
arched
entrance
of
the
main
saloon
the
word
sultana
in
gold
letters
that
still
glittered
brightly
informed
me
that
i
was
now
inside
the
carcase
of
one
of
the
most
famous
boats
that
ever
cleft
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
strange
thoughts
came
into
my
mind
as
i
stood
regarding
this
desolate
saloon
silent
and
solitary
it
seemed
even
more
so
i
thought
than
would
some
lonely
spot
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
the
very
absence
of
those
sounds
that
one
is
accustomed
to
hear
in
such
a
place
the
grinding
of
the
machinery
the
hoarse
detonations
of
the
the
voices
of
men
the
busy
hum
of
conversation
or
the
ringing
laugh
the
absence
of
the
sights
too
the
brilliant
chandeliers
the
long
tables
sparkling
with
crystal
the
absence
of
these
and
yet
the
presence
of
the
scene
associated
with
such
sights
and
sounds
gave
to
the
place
an
air
of
indescribable
desolation
i
felt
as
one
within
the
ruins
of
some
old
convent
or
amidst
the
tombs
of
an
antique
cemetery
no
furniture
of
any
kind
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
place
the
only
visible
objects
were
the
coarse
strewed
over
the
floor
and
upon
which
uncle
sam
had
made
me
welcome
to
repose
myself
after
surveying
my
odd
chamber
and
giving
way
to
some
singular
reflections
i
began
to
think
of
disposing
of
myself
for
sleep
i
was
wearied
my
health
was
not
yet
restored
the
clean
bast
of
the
looked
inviting
i
dragged
of
them
together
placed
them
side
by
side
and
then
throwing
myself
upon
my
back
drew
my
cloak
over
me
the
yielded
to
the
weight
of
my
body
giving
me
a
comfortable
position
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
fell
asleep
chapter
forty
three
the
norway
rat
i
must
have
slept
an
hour
or
more
i
did
not
think
of
consulting
my
watch
before
going
to
sleep
and
i
had
little
thought
about
such
a
thing
after
i
awoke
but
that
i
had
slept
at
least
an
hour
i
could
tell
by
the
length
of
my
candle
a
fearful
hour
that
was
as
any
i
can
remember
to
have
spent
an
hour
of
horrid
dreaming
but
i
am
wrong
to
call
it
so
it
was
no
dream
though
at
the
time
i
thought
it
one
listen
as
i
have
said
i
lay
down
upon
my
back
covering
myself
with
my
ample
cloak
from
the
chin
to
the
ankles
my
face
and
feet
were
alone
free
i
had
placed
one
of
the
bags
for
a
pillow
and
thus
raised
my
head
in
such
a
position
that
i
had
a
full
view
of
the
rest
of
my
person
the
light
set
just
a
little
way
beyond
my
heels
was
right
before
my
eyes
and
i
could
see
the
floor
in
that
direction
to
the
distance
of
several
yards
i
have
said
that
in
five
minutes
i
was
asleep
i
thought
that
i
was
asleep
and
to
this
hour
i
think
so
and
yet
my
eyes
were
open
and
i
plainly
saw
the
candle
before
them
and
that
portion
of
the
floor
illumined
by
its
rays
i
thought
that
i
endeavoured
to
close
my
eyes
but
could
not
nor
could
i
change
my
position
but
lay
regarding
the
light
and
the
surface
of
the
floor
around
it
presently
a
strange
sight
was
presented
to
me
a
number
of
small
shining
objects
began
to
dance
and
scintillate
in
the
darkness
beyond
at
first
i
took
them
for
but
although
these
were
plenty
enough
without
it
was
not
usual
to
find
them
inside
an
enclosed
apartment
moreover
those
i
saw
were
low
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
saloon
and
not
suspended
in
the
air
as
they
should
have
been
gradually
the
number
of
these
shining
objects
increased
there
were
now
some
dozens
of
them
and
what
was
singular
they
seemed
to
move
in
pairs
they
were
i
began
to
experience
a
sensation
of
alarm
i
began
to
feel
that
there
was
danger
in
these
fiery
spots
that
sparkled
in
such
numbers
along
the
floor
what
on
earth
could
they
be
i
had
scarce
asked
myself
the
question
when
i
was
enabled
to
answer
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
senses
but
not
to
the
tranquillising
of
my
fears
the
horrid
truth
now
flashed
upon
me
each
pair
of
sparkling
points
was
a
of
it
was
no
relief
to
me
to
know
they
were
the
eyes
of
rats
you
may
smile
at
my
fears
but
i
tell
you
in
all
seriousness
that
i
would
not
have
been
more
frightened
had
i
awaked
and
found
a
panther
crouching
to
spring
upon
me
i
had
heard
such
tales
of
these
norway
rats
had
in
fact
been
witness
to
their
bold
and
ferocious
feats
in
new
orleans
where
at
that
time
they
swarmed
in
countless
numbers
that
the
sight
of
them
filled
me
with
disgust
and
horror
but
what
was
most
horrible
of
all
i
saw
that
they
were
approaching
me
that
they
were
each
moment
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
that
was
unable
to
get
out
of
their
yes
i
could
not
move
my
arms
and
limbs
felt
like
solid
blocks
of
stone
and
my
muscular
power
was
quite
gone
i
thought
that
i
was
yes
reflected
i
for
i
still
possessed
the
power
of
reflection
yes
i
am
only
dreaming
a
horrid
dream
though
horrid
would
i
could
wake
myself
is
nightmare
i
know
it
if
i
could
but
move
something
my
toes
my
fingers
oh
these
reflections
actually
passed
through
my
mind
they
have
done
so
at
other
times
when
i
have
been
under
the
influence
of
nightmare
and
i
now
no
longer
dread
this
incubus
since
i
have
learnt
how
to
throw
it
off
i
could
not
i
lay
like
one
dead
whose
eyelids
have
been
left
unclosed
and
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
dreaming
or
awake
my
soul
had
not
yet
reached
its
climax
of
horror
as
i
continued
to
gaze
i
perceived
that
the
number
of
the
hideous
animals
increased
every
moment
i
could
now
see
their
brown
hairy
bodies
for
they
had
approached
close
to
the
candle
and
were
full
under
its
light
they
were
upon
the
it
appeared
to
be
alive
with
them
and
in
motion
like
water
under
a
gale
hideous
sight
to
behold
still
nearer
they
came
i
could
distinguish
their
sharp
teeth
the
long
grey
bristles
upon
their
snouts
the
spiteful
expression
in
their
small
penetrating
eyes
nearer
still
they
climb
upon
the
they
crawl
along
my
legs
and
body
they
chase
each
other
over
the
folds
of
my
cloak
they
are
gnawing
at
my
boots
horror
horror
they
will
devour
me
they
are
around
me
in
myriads
i
can
not
see
on
either
side
but
i
know
that
they
are
all
around
i
can
hear
their
shrill
screaming
the
air
is
loaded
with
the
odour
of
their
filthy
bodies
i
feel
as
though
it
will
suffocate
me
horror
horror
oh
merciful
god
arouse
me
from
this
terrible
dream
such
were
my
thoughts
such
my
feelings
at
that
moment
i
had
a
perfect
consciousness
of
all
that
was
passing
so
perfect
that
i
believed
it
a
dream
i
made
every
effort
to
awake
myself
to
move
hand
and
limb
it
was
all
in
vain
i
could
not
move
a
muscle
every
nerve
of
my
body
was
asleep
my
blood
lay
stagnant
within
my
veins
i
lay
suffering
this
monstrous
pain
for
a
long
long
while
i
lay
in
fear
of
being
eaten
up
piecemeal
the
fierce
animals
had
only
attacked
my
boots
and
my
cloak
but
my
terror
was
complete
i
waited
to
feel
them
at
my
throat
was
it
my
face
and
my
eyes
staring
open
that
kept
them
off
i
am
certain
my
eyes
were
open
all
the
while
was
it
that
that
deterred
them
from
attacking
me
no
doubt
it
was
they
scrambled
over
all
parts
of
my
body
even
up
to
my
breast
but
they
seemed
to
avoid
my
head
and
face
whether
they
would
have
continued
under
the
restraint
of
this
salutary
fear
i
know
not
for
a
sudden
termination
was
put
to
the
horrid
scene
the
candle
had
burnt
to
its
end
and
the
remnant
fell
with
a
hissing
sound
through
the
neck
of
the
bottle
thus
extinguishing
the
light
frightened
by
the
sudden
transition
from
light
to
darkness
the
hideous
animals
uttered
their
terrible
squeaking
and
broke
off
in
every
direction
i
could
hear
the
pattering
of
their
feet
upon
the
planks
as
they
scampered
away
the
light
seemed
to
have
been
the
spell
that
bound
me
in
the
iron
chain
of
the
nightmare
the
moment
it
went
out
i
found
myself
again
in
possession
of
muscular
strength
and
springing
to
my
feet
i
caught
up
my
cloak
and
swept
it
wildly
around
me
shouting
at
the
top
of
my
voice
the
cold
perspiration
was
running
from
every
pore
in
my
skin
and
my
hair
felt
as
if
on
end
i
still
believed
i
was
dreaming
and
it
was
not
until
the
astonished
negro
appeared
with
a
light
and
i
had
evidence
of
the
presence
of
my
hairy
visitors
in
the
condition
of
my
cloak
and
boots
that
i
was
convinced
the
terrible
episode
was
a
reality
i
remained
no
longer
in
the
saloon
but
wrapping
my
cloak
around
me
betook
myself
to
the
open
air
chapter
forty
four
the
houma
i
had
not
much
longer
to
remain
on
the
the
hoarse
barking
of
a
fell
upon
my
ear
and
shortly
after
the
fires
of
a
steamboat
furnace
appeared
glittering
red
upon
the
stream
then
was
heard
the
crashing
plunging
sound
of
the
as
they
beat
the
brown
water
and
then
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
shouts
of
command
passing
from
captain
to
mate
and
from
mate
to
deck
hands
and
in
five
minutes
after
the
houma
red
lay
side
by
side
with
the
old
sultana
i
stepped
aboard
threw
my
luggage
over
the
guard
and
climbing
seated
myself
under
the
awning
ten
minutes
of
apparent
confusion
the
quick
trampling
of
feet
over
the
decks
and
staging
passengers
hastening
ashore
others
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
the
screeching
of
the
steam
the
rattling
of
huge
thrust
endways
up
the
furnace
at
intervals
the
loud
words
of
command
a
peal
of
laughter
at
some
rude
jest
or
the
murmur
of
voices
in
the
sadder
accents
of
adieu
ten
minutes
of
these
sights
and
sounds
and
again
was
heard
the
ringing
of
the
large
bell
the
signal
that
the
boat
was
about
to
continue
her
course
i
had
flung
myself
into
a
chair
that
stood
beside
one
of
the
and
close
to
the
guards
from
my
position
i
commanded
a
view
of
the
gangway
the
and
the
contiguous
which
i
had
just
left
i
was
looking
listlessly
on
what
was
passing
below
taking
note
of
nothing
in
particular
if
i
had
a
special
thought
in
my
mind
the
subject
of
it
was
not
there
and
the
thought
itself
caused
me
to
turn
my
eyes
away
from
the
busy
groups
and
bend
them
downward
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
perhaps
a
sigh
was
the
concomitant
of
these
occasional
glances
but
in
the
intervals
between
my
mind
dwelt
upon
nothing
in
particular
and
the
forms
that
hurried
to
and
fro
impressed
me
only
as
shadows
this
apathy
was
suddenly
interrupted
my
eyes
by
pure
accident
fell
upon
two
figures
whose
movements
at
once
excited
my
attention
they
stood
upon
the
deck
of
the
not
near
the
where
the
torch
cast
its
glare
over
the
hurrying
passengers
but
in
a
remote
corner
under
the
shadow
of
the
awning
i
could
see
them
only
in
an
obscure
light
in
fact
could
scarce
make
out
their
forms
shrouded
as
they
were
in
dark
cloaks
but
the
attitudes
in
which
they
stood
the
fact
of
their
keeping
thus
apart
in
the
most
obscure
quarter
of
the
boat
the
apparent
earnestness
with
which
they
were
conversing
all
led
me
to
conjecture
that
they
were
lovers
my
heart
guided
by
the
sweet
instinct
of
love
at
once
accepted
this
explanation
and
looked
for
no
other
yes
lovers
how
happy
no
perhaps
not
so
happy
it
is
a
some
youth
who
makes
a
trip
down
to
the
city
perhaps
some
young
clerk
or
merchant
who
goes
to
spend
his
winter
there
what
of
that
he
will
return
in
spring
again
to
press
those
delicate
fingers
again
to
fold
that
fair
form
in
his
arms
again
to
speak
those
tender
words
that
will
sound
all
the
sweeter
after
the
long
interval
of
silence
happy
youth
happy
girl
light
is
the
misery
of
a
parting
like
yours
how
easy
to
endure
when
compared
with
that
violent
separation
which
i
have
experienced
aurore
aurore
would
that
you
were
free
would
that
you
were
some
dame
not
that
i
should
love
you
the
more
impossible
but
then
might
i
boldly
woo
and
freely
win
then
i
might
hope
but
now
alas
this
horrid
gulf
this
social
abyss
that
yawns
between
us
well
it
can
not
separate
souls
our
love
shall
bridge
it
ha
hilloa
mister
what
gwine
wrong
anybody
fell
overboard
i
heeded
not
the
rude
interrogatory
a
deeper
pang
absorbed
my
soul
forcing
from
me
the
wild
exclamation
that
had
given
the
speaker
cause
the
two
forms
parted
with
a
mutual
pressure
of
the
hand
with
a
kiss
they
parted
the
young
man
hastened
across
the
staging
i
did
not
observe
his
face
as
he
passed
under
the
light
i
had
taken
no
notice
of
my
eyes
by
some
strange
fascination
remaining
fixed
upon
i
was
curious
to
observe
how
would
act
in
this
final
moment
of
the
planks
were
drawn
aboard
the
sounded
i
could
perceive
that
we
were
moving
away
at
this
moment
the
shrouded
form
of
the
lady
glided
forward
into
the
light
she
was
advancing
to
catch
a
farewell
glance
of
her
lover
a
few
steps
brought
her
to
the
edge
of
the
where
the
torch
was
glaring
her
was
thrown
back
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
glistened
along
the
undulating
masses
of
black
hair
that
shrouded
her
temples
and
danced
in
her
glorious
eyes
good
god
they
were
the
eyes
of
no
wonder
i
uttered
the
wild
ejaculation
it
is
she
what
a
female
overboard
do
you
say
where
where
the
man
was
evidently
in
earnest
my
soliloquy
had
been
loud
enough
to
reach
his
ears
he
believed
it
to
be
a
reply
to
his
previous
question
and
my
excited
manner
confirmed
him
in
the
belief
that
a
woman
had
actually
fallen
into
the
river
his
questions
and
exclamations
were
overheard
and
repeated
in
the
voices
of
others
who
stood
near
like
wildfire
an
alarm
ran
through
the
boat
passengers
rushed
from
the
cabins
along
the
guards
and
out
to
the
front
awning
and
mingled
their
hurried
interrogatories
who
what
where
a
loud
voice
cried
out
some
one
overboard
a
woman
it
a
woman
knowing
the
cause
of
this
ridiculous
alarm
i
gave
no
heed
to
it
my
mind
was
occupied
with
a
far
different
matter
the
first
shock
of
a
hideous
passion
absorbed
my
whole
soul
and
i
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
around
me
i
had
scarce
recognised
the
face
when
the
boat
rounding
brought
the
angle
of
the
cabin
between
it
and
me
i
rushed
forward
as
far
as
the
gangway
i
was
too
late
the
obstructed
the
view
i
did
not
halt
but
ran
on
directing
myself
towards
the
top
of
the
passengers
in
their
excitement
were
rushing
along
the
guards
they
hindered
my
progress
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
climb
up
the
and
stand
upon
its
rounded
roof
i
did
so
at
length
but
too
late
the
boat
had
forged
several
hundred
yards
into
the
stream
i
could
see
the
with
its
glaring
lights
i
could
even
see
human
forms
standing
along
its
deck
but
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
that
one
that
my
eyes
were
in
search
of
disappointed
i
stepped
on
to
the
which
was
almost
a
continuation
of
the
roof
of
the
there
i
could
be
alone
and
commune
with
my
now
bitter
thoughts
i
was
not
to
have
that
luxury
just
then
shouts
the
trampling
of
heavy
boots
bounding
over
the
planks
and
the
pattering
of
lighter
feet
sounded
in
my
ears
and
next
moment
a
stream
of
passengers
male
and
female
came
pouring
up
the
sides
of
the
that
the
gentleman
that
him
cried
a
voice
in
another
instant
the
excited
throng
was
around
me
several
inquiring
at
once
who
overboard
who
where
of
course
i
saw
that
these
interrogatories
were
meant
for
me
i
saw
too
that
an
answer
was
necessary
to
allay
their
ludicrous
alarm
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
said
there
is
no
one
overboard
that
i
am
aware
of
why
do
you
ask
hilloa
mister
cried
the
cause
of
all
this
confusion
did
you
tell
me
i
told
you
nothing
but
did
i
ask
you
if
thar
wa
some
one
overboard
you
did
and
you
said
in
reply
i
said
nothing
in
reply
darned
if
you
did
you
said
she
is
or
was
she
or
something
o
that
sort
i
turned
towards
the
speaker
who
i
perceived
was
rather
losing
credit
with
his
auditory
mister
said
i
imitating
his
tone
it
is
evident
you
have
never
heard
of
the
man
who
grew
immensely
rich
by
minding
his
own
business
my
remark
settled
the
affair
it
was
received
by
a
yell
of
laughter
that
completely
discomfited
my
meddling
antagonist
who
after
some
little
swaggering
and
loud
talk
at
length
went
below
to
the
bar
to
soothe
his
mortified
spirit
with
a
the
others
dropped
away
one
by
one
and
dispersed
themselves
through
the
various
cabins
and
saloons
and
i
found
myself
once
more
the
sole
occupant
of
the
chapter
forty
five
jealousy
have
you
ever
loved
in
humble
life
some
fair
young
girl
whose
lot
was
among
the
lowly
but
whose
brilliant
beauty
in
your
eyes
annihilated
all
social
inequalities
love
levels
all
distinctions
is
an
adage
old
as
the
hills
it
brings
down
the
proud
heart
and
teaches
condescension
to
the
haughty
spirit
but
its
tendency
is
to
elevate
to
ennoble
it
does
not
make
a
peasant
of
the
prince
but
a
prince
of
the
peasant
behold
the
object
of
your
adoration
engaged
in
her
ordinary
duties
she
fetches
a
jar
of
water
from
the
well
barefoot
she
treads
the
path
those
nude
pellucid
feet
are
fairer
in
their
nakedness
than
the
most
delicate
of
silk
and
satin
the
wreaths
and
pearl
circlets
the
pins
of
gold
and
drupes
of
coral
the
costliest
of
the
dress
circle
all
seem
plain
and
poor
compared
with
the
glossy
of
those
bright
tresses
the
earthen
jar
sits
upon
her
head
with
the
grace
of
a
golden
coronet
every
attitude
is
the
of
a
statue
a
study
for
a
sculptor
and
the
coarse
garment
that
drapes
that
form
is
in
your
eyes
more
becoming
than
a
robe
of
richest
velvet
you
care
not
for
that
you
are
not
thinking
of
the
casket
but
of
the
pearl
it
conceals
she
disappears
within
the
cottage
her
humble
home
humble
in
your
eyes
no
longer
humble
that
little
kitchen
with
its
wooden
chairs
and
scoured
dresser
its
deal
shelf
with
mugs
cups
and
plates
its
walls
and
cheap
prints
of
the
red
soldier
and
the
blue
sailor
that
little
museum
of
the
of
the
poor
is
now
filled
with
a
light
that
renders
it
more
brilliant
than
the
gilded
saloons
of
wealth
and
fashion
that
cottage
with
its
low
roof
and
woodbine
trellis
has
become
a
palace
the
light
of
love
has
transformed
it
a
paradise
you
are
forbidden
to
enter
yes
with
all
your
wealth
and
power
your
fine
looks
and
your
titles
of
distinction
your
superfine
cloth
and
bright
lacquered
boots
mayhap
you
dare
not
enter
there
and
oh
how
you
envy
those
who
dare
how
you
envy
the
spruce
apprentice
and
the
lout
in
the
smock
who
cracks
his
whip
and
whistles
with
as
much
as
if
he
was
between
the
handles
of
his
plough
as
though
the
awe
of
that
fair
presence
should
not
freeze
his
lips
to
stone
that
he
is
how
you
envy
him
his
how
you
could
slaughter
him
for
those
sweet
smiles
that
appear
to
be
lavished
upon
him
there
maybe
no
meaning
in
those
smiles
they
may
be
the
expressions
of
of
simple
friendship
perhaps
of
a
little
coquetry
for
all
that
you
can
not
behold
them
without
envy
without
if
there
be
a
meaning
if
they
be
the
smiles
of
love
if
the
heart
of
that
simple
girl
has
made
its
lodgement
either
upon
the
young
apprentice
or
him
of
the
smock
then
are
you
fated
to
the
bitterest
pang
that
human
breast
can
know
it
is
not
jealousy
of
the
ordinary
kind
it
is
far
more
painful
wounded
vanity
adds
a
poison
to
the
sting
oh
it
is
hard
to
bear
a
pang
of
this
nature
i
suffered
as
i
paced
that
high
platform
fortunately
they
had
left
me
alone
the
feelings
that
worked
within
me
could
not
be
concealed
my
looks
and
wild
gestures
must
have
betrayed
them
i
should
have
been
a
subject
for
satire
and
laughter
but
i
was
alone
the
pilot
in
his
did
not
notice
me
his
back
was
towards
me
and
his
keen
eye
bent
steadily
upon
the
water
was
too
busy
with
logs
and
and
snags
and
sawyers
to
take
note
of
my
delirium
it
aurore
of
that
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
her
face
was
not
to
be
mistaken
for
any
other
there
was
none
like
it
none
so
lovely
alas
too
fatally
fair
who
could
be
some
young
spark
of
the
town
some
clerk
in
one
of
the
stores
a
young
planter
who
maybe
and
with
this
thought
came
that
bitter
pang
one
of
her
own
proscribed
race
a
young
man
of
colour
a
mulatto
a
quadroon
a
slave
ha
to
be
rivalled
by
a
slave
worse
than
infamous
coquette
why
had
i
yielded
to
her
fascinations
why
had
i
mistaken
her
craft
for
her
falsehood
for
truth
who
could
be
i
should
search
the
boat
till
i
found
him
unfortunately
i
had
taken
no
marks
either
of
his
face
or
his
dress
my
eyes
had
remained
fixed
upon
her
after
their
parting
in
the
shadow
i
had
seen
him
only
indistinctly
and
as
he
passed
under
the
lights
i
saw
him
not
how
preposterous
then
to
think
of
looking
for
him
i
could
not
recognise
him
in
such
a
crowd
i
went
below
and
wandered
through
the
cabins
under
the
front
awning
and
along
the
i
scanned
every
face
with
an
eagerness
that
to
some
must
have
appeared
impertinence
wherever
one
was
young
and
handsome
he
was
an
object
of
my
scrutiny
and
jealousy
there
were
several
such
among
the
male
passengers
and
i
endeavoured
to
distinguish
those
who
had
come
aboard
at
bringiers
there
were
some
young
men
who
appeared
as
if
they
had
lately
shipped
themselves
but
i
had
no
clue
to
guide
me
and
i
failed
to
find
my
rival
in
the
chagrin
of
disappointment
i
returned
once
more
to
the
roof
but
i
had
hardly
reached
it
when
a
new
thought
came
into
my
mind
i
remembered
that
the
slaves
of
the
plantation
were
to
be
sent
down
to
the
city
by
the
first
boat
were
they
not
travelling
by
that
very
one
i
had
seen
a
crowd
of
blacks
men
women
and
children
hastily
driven
aboard
i
had
paid
but
little
heed
to
such
a
common
spectacle
one
that
may
be
witnessed
daily
hourly
i
had
not
thought
of
it
that
those
might
be
the
slaves
of
the
plantation
besancon
if
they
were
then
indeed
there
might
still
be
hope
aurore
had
not
gone
with
them
but
what
of
that
though
like
them
only
a
slave
it
was
not
probable
she
would
have
been
forced
to
herd
with
them
upon
the
deck
but
she
had
not
come
aboard
the
staging
had
been
already
taken
in
as
i
recognised
her
on
the
on
the
supposition
that
the
slaves
of
besancon
were
aboard
my
heart
felt
relieved
i
was
filled
with
a
hope
that
all
might
yet
be
well
why
you
may
ask
i
answer
simply
because
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
the
youth
who
so
tenderly
parted
from
aurore
be
a
brother
or
some
near
i
had
not
heard
of
such
relationship
it
might
be
so
however
and
my
heart
reacting
from
its
hour
of
keen
anguish
was
eager
to
relieve
itself
by
any
hypothesis
i
could
not
endure
doubt
longer
and
turning
on
my
heel
i
hastened
below
down
the
kleets
of
the
along
the
then
down
the
main
stairs
to
the
threading
my
way
among
bags
of
maize
and
hogsheads
of
sugar
now
stooping
under
the
great
axle
now
climbing
over
huge
i
reached
the
of
the
lower
deck
usually
appropriated
to
the
deck
passengers
the
poor
immigrants
of
ireland
and
germany
who
here
huddle
miscellaneously
with
the
swarthy
bondsmen
of
the
south
as
i
had
hoped
there
were
they
those
black
but
friendly
faces
every
one
of
them
old
zip
and
aunt
chloe
and
the
little
chloe
hannibal
the
new
coachman
and
caesar
and
pompey
and
all
all
on
their
way
to
the
dreaded
mart
i
had
halted
a
second
or
two
before
approaching
them
the
light
was
in
my
favour
and
i
saw
them
before
discovering
my
presence
there
were
no
signs
of
mirth
in
that
sable
group
i
heard
no
laughter
no
light
revelry
as
was
their
wont
to
indulge
in
in
days
gone
by
among
their
little
cabins
in
the
quarter
a
deep
melancholy
had
taken
possession
of
the
features
of
all
gloom
was
in
every
glance
even
the
children
usually
reckless
of
the
unknown
future
seemed
impressed
with
the
same
sentiment
they
rolled
not
about
tumbling
over
each
other
they
played
not
at
all
they
sat
without
stirring
and
silent
even
they
poor
infant
helots
knew
enough
to
fear
for
their
dark
future
to
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
the
all
were
downcast
no
wonder
they
had
been
used
to
kind
treatment
they
might
pass
to
a
hard
taskmaster
not
one
of
them
knew
where
in
another
day
should
be
his
home
what
sort
of
tyrant
should
be
his
lord
but
that
was
not
all
still
worse
friends
they
were
going
to
be
parted
relatives
they
would
be
torn
asunder
perhaps
never
to
meet
more
husband
looked
upon
wife
brother
upon
sister
father
upon
child
mother
upon
infant
with
dread
in
the
heart
and
agony
in
the
eye
it
was
painful
to
gaze
upon
this
sorrowing
group
to
contemplate
the
suffering
the
mental
anguish
that
spoke
plainly
in
every
face
to
think
of
the
wrongs
which
one
man
can
legally
put
upon
another
the
deep
sinful
wrongs
the
outrage
of
every
human
principle
oh
it
was
terribly
painful
to
look
on
that
picture
it
was
some
relief
to
me
to
know
that
my
presence
threw
at
least
a
momentary
light
over
its
shade
smiles
chased
away
the
sombre
shadows
as
i
appeared
and
joyous
exclamations
hailed
me
had
i
been
their
saviour
i
could
not
have
met
a
more
eager
welcome
amidst
their
fervid
ejaculations
i
could
distinguish
earnest
appeals
that
i
would
buy
them
that
i
would
become
their
master
mingled
with
zealous
protestations
of
service
and
devotion
alas
they
knew
not
how
heavily
at
that
moment
the
price
of
one
of
their
number
lay
upon
my
heart
i
strove
to
be
gay
to
cheer
them
with
words
of
consolation
i
rather
needed
to
be
myself
consoled
during
this
while
my
eyes
were
busy
i
scanned
the
faces
of
all
there
was
light
enough
glimmering
from
two
to
enable
me
to
do
so
several
were
young
mulattoes
upon
these
my
glance
rested
one
after
the
other
how
my
heart
throbbed
in
this
examination
it
triumphed
at
length
surely
there
was
no
face
there
that
could
love
were
they
all
present
yes
all
so
scipio
said
all
but
aurore
and
aurore
i
asked
have
you
heard
any
more
of
her
no
mass
gone
to
de
city
she
go
by
de
road
in
a
carriage
not
by
de
boat
some
ob
de
folks
say
daat
i
this
was
strange
enough
taking
the
black
aside
tell
me
scipio
i
asked
has
aurore
any
relative
among
you
any
brother
or
sister
or
cousin
no
mass
a
one
golly
mass
she
near
white
as
missa
all
de
rest
be
black
or
yeller
she
quaderoom
yeller
folks
all
mulatto
no
kin
to
no
i
was
perplexed
and
puzzled
my
former
doubts
came
crowding
back
upon
me
my
jealousy
returned
scipio
could
not
clear
up
the
mystery
his
answer
to
other
questions
which
i
put
to
him
gave
me
no
solution
to
it
and
i
returned
with
a
heart
that
suffered
under
the
pressure
of
disappointment
the
only
reflection
from
which
i
drew
comfort
was
that
i
might
have
been
mistaken
perhaps
after
all
it
was
aurore
chapter
forty
six
a
scientific
julep
to
drown
care
and
sorrow
men
drink
the
spirit
of
wine
freely
quaffed
will
master
either
bodily
pain
or
mental
suffering
for
a
time
there
is
no
form
of
the
one
or
phase
of
the
other
so
difficult
to
subdue
as
the
pang
of
jealousy
wine
must
be
deeply
quaffed
before
that
corroding
poison
can
be
washed
free
from
the
heart
but
there
is
a
partial
relief
in
the
and
i
sought
it
i
knew
it
to
be
only
temporary
and
that
the
sorrow
would
soon
return
but
even
so
even
a
short
respite
was
to
be
desired
i
could
bear
my
thoughts
no
longer
i
am
not
brave
in
bearing
pain
i
have
more
than
once
intoxicated
myself
to
deaden
the
pitiful
pain
of
a
toothache
by
the
same
means
i
resolved
to
relieve
the
dire
aching
of
my
heart
the
spirit
of
wine
was
nigh
at
hand
and
might
be
imbibed
in
many
forms
in
one
corner
of
the
was
the
bar
with
its
elegant
adornments
its
rows
of
decanters
and
bottles
with
silver
stoppers
and
labels
its
glasses
and
lemons
and
its
bouquet
of
aromatic
mint
and
fragrant
pines
its
bunches
of
straw
tubes
for
sucking
the

the
claret
sangaree
in
the
midst
of
this
stood
the
and
in
this
individual
do
not
picture
to
yourself
some
seedy
personage
of
the
waiter
class
with
bloodless
cheeks
and
clammy
skin
such
as
those
monstrosities
of
an
english
hotel
who
give
you
a
very
for
your
dinner
on
the
contrary
behold
an
of
latest
fashion
that
is
the
fashion
of
his
country
and
class
the
men
of
the
river
he
wears
neither
coat
nor
vest
while
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
but
his
shirt
will
merit
an
observation
it
is
of
the
finest
fabric
of
the
irish
loom
too
fine
to
be
worn
by
those
who
have
woven
it
and
no
bond
street
could
equal
its
make
up
gold
buttons
glance
at
the
sleeves
and
diamonds
sparkle
amid
the
profuse
ruffles
on
the
bosom
the
collar
is
turned
down
over
a
black
silk
riband
knotted
la
but
a
tropic
sun
has
more
to
do
with
this
fashion
than
any
desire
to
imitate
the
over
this
shirt
stretch
silk
braces
elaborately
and
still
further
adorned
by
buckles
of
pure
gold
a
hat

the
costly
grass
from
the
shores
of
the
south
sea
crowns
his
locks
and
thus
you
have
the
of
the
boat
his
nether
man
need
not
be
described
that
is
the
unseen
portion
of
his
person
which
is
below
the
level
of
the
bar
no
cringing
smirking
obsequious
he
but
a
dashing
sprig
who
perhaps
his
bar
and
all
its
contents
and
who
holds
his
head
as
high
as
either
the
clerk
or
captain
as
i
approached
this
gentleman
he
placed
a
glass
upon
the
counter
and
threw
into
it
some
broken
fragments
of
ice
all
this
was
done
without
a
word
having
passed
between
us
i
had
no
need
to
give
an
order
he
saw
in
my
eye
the
determination
to
drink
cobbler
no
said
i
a
very
well
i
mix
you
a
julep
that
set
your
teeth
for
you
thank
you
just
what
i
want
the
gentleman
now
placed
side
by
side
two
glasses
tumblers
of
large
size
into
one
he
put
first
a
spoonful
of
crushed
white
sugar
then
a
slice
of
lemon
ditto
of
orange
next
a
few
sprigs
of
green
mint
after
that
a
handful
of
broken
ice
a
gill
of
water
and
lastly
a
large
glass
measure
of
cognac
this
done
he
lifted
the
glasses
one
in
each
hand
and
poured
the
contents
from
one
to
the
other
so
rapidly
that
ice
brandy
lemons
and
all
seemed
to
be
constantly
suspended
in
the
air
and
oscillating
between
the
glasses
the
tumblers
themselves
at
no
time
approached
nearer
than
two
feet
from
each
other
this
adroitness
peculiar
to
his
craft
and
only
obtained
after
long
practice
was
evidently
a
source
of
professional
pride
after
some
of
these
revolutions
the
drink
was
permitted
to
rest
in
one
glass
and
was
then
set
down
upon
the
counter
there
yet
remained
to
be
given
the
finishing
touch
a
thin
slice
of
was
cut
freshly
from
the
fruit
this
held
between
the
finger
and
thumb
was
doubled
over
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
then
passed
with
an
adroit
sweep
round
the
circumference
that
the
latest
orleans
touch
remarked
the
with
a
smile
as
he
completed
the
manoeuvre
there
was
a
double
purpose
in
this
little
operation
the
not
only
cleared
the
glass
of
the
grains
of
sugar
and
broken
leaves
of
mint
but
left
its
fragrant
juice
to
mingle
its
aroma
with
the
beverage
the
latest
orleans
touch
he
repeated
scientific
style
i
nodded
my
assent
the
julep
was
now
mixed
which
fact
was
made
known
to
me
by
the
glass
being
pushed
a
little
nearer
across
the
marble
surface
of
the
counter
have
a
straw
was
the
laconic
inquiry
yes
thank
you
a
joint
of
wheaten
straw
was
plunged
into
the
glass
and
taking
this
between
my
lips
i
drew
in
large
draughts
of
perhaps
the
most
delicious
of
all
intoxicating
drinks
the
the
aromatic
liquid
had
scarce
passed
my
lips
when
i
began
to
feel
its
effects
my
pulse
ceased
its
wild
throbbing
my
blood
became
cool
and
flowed
in
a
more
gentle
current
through
my
veins
and
my
heart
seemed
to
be
bathing
in
the
waters
of
lethe
the
relief
was
almost
instantaneous
and
i
only
wondered
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
though
still
far
from
happy
i
felt
that
i
held
in
my
hands
what
would
soon
make
me
so
transitory
that
happiness
might
be
yet
the
reaction
was
welcome
at
the
moment
and
the
prospect
of
it
pleasant
to
my
soul
i
eagerly
swallowed
the
inspiring
beverage
swallowed
it
in
large
draughts
till
the
straw
tube
rattling
among
the
fragments
of
ice
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
admonished
me
that
the
fluid
was
all
gone
another
if
you
please
you
liked
it
i
guess
most
excellent
said
so
i
reckon
stranger
we
can
get
up
a
on
board
this
here
boat
equal
to
either
saint
charles
or
verandah
if
not
a
leetle
superior
to
either
a
superb
drink
we
can
mix
a
too
that
ai
hard
to
take
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
i
not
fond
of
sherry
i
prefer
this
you
right
so
do
i
the
a
new
idea
but
an
improvement
i
think
i
think
so
too
have
a
fresh
straw
thank
you
this
young
fellow
was
unusually
civil
i
fancied
that
his
civility
proceeded
from
my
having
eulogised
his
it
was
not
that
as
i
afterwards
ascertained
these
western
people
are
little
accessible
to
cheap
flattery
i
owed
his
good
opinion
of
me
to
a
far
different
cause
discomfiture
i
had
put
on
the
meddling
i
believe
he
had
also
learnt
that
it
was
i
who
had
chastised
the
bully
larkin
such
feats
of
arms
soon
become
known
in
the
region
of
the
mississippi
valley
where
strength
and
courage
are
qualities
of
high
esteem
hence
in
the
view
i
was
one
who
deserved
a
civil
word
and
thus
talking
together
on
the
best
of
terms
i
swallowed
my
second
julep
and
called
upon
him
for
a
third
aurore
was
for
the
moment
forgotten
or
when
remembered
it
was
with
less
of
bitterness
now
and
then
that
parting
scene
came
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
but
the
pang
that
rose
with
it
was
each
moment
growing
feebler
and
easier
to
be
endured
chapter
forty
seven
a
game
of
whist
in
the
centre
of
the
there
was
a
table
and
around
it
some
men
were
seated
other
stood
behind
these
looking
over
their
shoulders
the
attitudes
of
all
and
their
eager
glances
suggested
the
nature
of
their
occupation
the
flouting
of
pasteboard
the
chink
of
dollars
and
the
words
of
ace
jack
and
trump
put
it
beyond
a
doubt
that
that
occupation
was
gaming
euchre
was
the
game
curious
to
observe
this
popular
american
game
i
stepped
up
and
stood
watching
the
players
my
friend
who
had
raised
the
false
alarm
was
one
of
them
but
his
back
was
towards
me
and
i
remained
for
some
time
unseen
by
him
some
two
or
three
of
those
who
played
were
men
their
coats
were
of
the
finest
cloth
their
ruffles
of
the
costliest
cambric
and
jewels
sparkled
in
their
shirt
bosoms
and
glittered
upon
their
fingers
these
fingers
however
told
a
tale
they
told
plainly
as
words
that
they
to
whom
they
belonged
had
not
always
been
accustomed
to
such
elegant
adornment
toilet
soap
had
failed
to
soften
the
corrugated
skin
and
obliterate
the
abrasions
the
souvenirs
of
toil
this
was
nothing
they
might
be
gentlemen
for
all
that
birth
is
of
slight
consequence
in
the
far
west
the
may
become
the
president
still
there
was
an
air
about
these
men
an
air
i
can
not
describe
but
which
led
me
at
the
moment
to
doubt
their
it
was
not
from
any
swagger
or
assumption
on
their
part
on
the
contrary
they
appeared
the
individuals
around
the
table
they
were
certainly
the
most
sedate
and
quiet
perhaps
it
was
this
very
sedateness
this
polished
reserve
that
formed
the
spring
of
my
suspicion
true
gentlemen
bloods
from
tennessee
or
kentucky
young
planters
of
the
mississippi
coast
or
french
creoles
of
orleans
would
have
offered
different
characteristics
the
cool
complacency
with
which
these
individuals
spoke
and
acted
no
symptoms
of
perturbation
as
the
trump
was
turned
no
signs
of
ruffled
temper
when
luck
went
against
them
told
two
things
first
that
they
were
men
of
the
world
and
secondly
that
they
were
not
now
playing
their
maiden
game
of
euchre
beyond
that
i
could
form
no
judgment
about
them
they
might
be
doctors
lawyers
or
gentlemen
of
elegant
leisure
a
class
by
no
means
uncommon
in
the
world
of
america
at
that
time
i
was
still
too
new
to
far
west
society
to
be
able
to
distinguish
its
features
besides
in
the
united
states
and
particularly
in
the
western
portion
of
the
country
those
peculiarities
of
dress
and
habit
which
in
the
form
as
it
were
the
landmarks
of
the
professions
do
not
exist
you
may
meet
the
preacher
wearing
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
the
judge
with
a
green
one
the
doctor
in
a
white
linen
jacket
and
the
baker
in
glossy
black
broadcloth
from
top
to
toe
where
every
man
assumes
the
right
to
be
a
gentleman
the
costumes
and
badges
of
trade
are
studiously
avoided
even
the
tailor
is
undistinguishable
in
the
mass
of
his
the
land
of
lies
farther
to
the
mexico
is
that
land
i
stood
for
some
time
watching
the
gamesters
and
the
game
had
i
not
known
something
of
the
banking
peculiarities
of
the
west
i
should
have
believed
that
they
were
gambling
for
enormous
sums
at
each
man
right
elbow
lay
a
huge
pile
of
flanked
by
a
few
pieces
of
silver
dollars
halves
and
quarters
accustomed
as
my
eyes
had
been
to
of
five
pounds
in
value
the
table
would
have
presented
to
me
a
rich
appearance
had
i
not
known
that
these
showy
parallelograms
of
and
were
mere
representing
amounts
that
varied
from
the
value
of
one
dollar
to
that
of
six
and
a
quarter
cents
notwithstanding
the
bets
were
far
from
being
low
twenty
fifty
and
even
a
hundred
dollars
frequently
changed
hands
in
a
single
game
i
perceived
that
the
hero
of
the
false
alarm
was
one
of
the
players
his
back
was
towards
me
where
i
stood
and
he
was
too
much
engrossed
with
his
game
to
look
around
in
dress
and
general
appearance
he
differed
altogether
from
the
rest
he
wore
a
white
beaver
hat
with
broad
brim
and
a
coat
of
great
jeans
and
he
had
the
look
of
a
from
indiana
or
a
from
cincinnati
yet
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
told
you
was
not
new
to
him
it
was
not
his
first
trip
down
south
most
probably
the
second
supposition
was
the
correct
one
he
was
a
dealer
in
one
of
the
fine
gentlemen
i
have
described
sat
opposite
to
where
i
was
standing
he
appeared
to
be
losing
considerable
sums
which
the
farmer
or
was
winning
it
proved
that
the
luck
of
the
cards
was
not
in
favour
of
the
players
an
inducement
to
other
plain
people
to
try
a
hand
i
began
to
feel
sympathy
for
the
elegant
gentleman
his
losses
were
so
severe
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
composure
with
which
he
bore
them
at
length
he
looked
up
and
scanned
the
faces
of
those
who
stood
around
he
seemed
desirous
of
giving
up
the
play
his
eye
met
mine
he
said
in
a
careless
way
perhaps
stranger
wish
to
take
a
hand
you
may
have
my
place
if
you
do
i
have
no
luck
i
could
not
win
under
any
circumstances
i
shall
give
up
playing
this
appeal
caused
the
rest
of
the
players
to
turn
their
faces
towards
me
and
among
others
the
i
expected
an
ebullition
of
anger
from
this
individual
i
was
disappointed
on
the
contrary
he
hailed
me
in
a
friendly
tone
hilloa
mister
cried
he
i
hope
you
a
miffed
at
me
not
in
the
least
i
replied
fact
i
meant
no
offence
did
think
thar
war
a
some
overboard
me
if
i
did
oh
i
have
taken
no
offence
rejoined
i
to
prove
it
i
ask
you
now
to
drink
with
me
the
juleps
and
the
late
reaction
from
bitter
thought
had
rendered
me
of
a
jovial
disposition
the
free
apology
at
once
won
my
forgiveness
good
as
wheat
assented
the
i
your
man
but
stranger
you
must
allow
me
to
pay
you
see
i
won
a
trifle
here
right
to
pay
for
the
drinks
oh
i
have
no
objection
well
then
let
all
licker
stand
drinks
all
round
what
say
you
fellars
a
murmur
of
assent
answered
the
interrogatory
good
continued
the
speaker
hyar
drinks
for
the
crowd
and
so
saying
he
of
the
and
jeans
coat
stepped
forward
to
the
bar
and
placed
a
couple
of
dollars
upon
the
counter
all
who
were
near
followed
him
shouting
each
out
the
name
of
the
beverage
most
to
his
liking
in
the
various
calls
of
cocktail
cobbler
julep
and
interesting
mixtures
in
america
men
do
not
sit
and
sip
their
liquor
but
drink
standing
one
might
say
for
be
it
hot
or
cold
mixed
or
neat
it
is
gone
in
a
gulp
and
then
the
drinkers
retire
to
their
chairs
to
smoke
chew
and
wait
for
the
fresh
invitation
let
all
licker
in
a
few
seconds
we
had
all
liquored
and
the
players
once
more
took
their
seats
around
the
table
the
gentleman
who
had
proposed
to
me
to
become
his
successor
did
not
return
to
his
place
he
had
no
luck
he
again
said
and
would
not
play
any
more
that
night
who
would
accept
his
place
and
his
partner
i
was
appealed
to
i
thanked
my
new
acquaintances
but
the
thing
was
impossible
as
i
had
never
played
euchre
and
therefore
knew
nothing
about
the
game
beyond
the
few
points
i
had
picked
up
while
watching
them
that
ar
awkward
said
the
ai
we
nohow
able
to
get
up
a
set
come
mr
chorley
i
believe
that
your
name
sir
this
was
addressed
to
the
gentleman
who
had
risen
you
ai
to
desart
us
that
away
we
ca
make
up
a
game
if
you
do
i
should
only
lose
if
i
played
longer
reiterated
chorley
no
continued
he
i
wo
risk
it
perhaps
this
gentleman
plays
suggested
another
alluding
to
me
you
an
englishman
sir
i
believe
i
never
knew
one
of
your
countrymen
who
was
not
a
good
true
i
can
play
whist
i
replied
carelessly
well
then
what
say
you
all
to
a
game
of
whist
inquired
the
last
speaker
glancing
around
the
table
do
know
much
about
the
game
bluntly
answered
the
mout
play
it
on
a
pinch
rayther
than
spoil
sport
but
whoever
hez
me
for
a
partner
have
to
keep
a
sharp
for
himself
i
reckon
i
guess
you
know
the
game
as
well
as
i
do
replied
the
one
who
had
proposed
it
i
hai
played
a
rubber
o
whist
for
many
a
year
but
if
we
ca
make
up
the
set
at
euchre
let
try
one
oh
if
you
goin
to
play
whist
interposed
the
gentleman
who
had
seceded
from
the
game
of
euchre
if
you
going
to
play
whist
i
mind
taking
a
hand
at
it
may
change
my
luck
and
if
this
gentleman
has
no
objection
i
like
him
for
my
partner
as
you
say
sir
englishmen
are
good
it
their
national
game
i
believe
wo
be
a
fair
match
mr
chorley
said
the
dealer
in
but
since
you
propose
it
if
mr
hatcher
here
your
name
sir
i
believe
hatcher
is
my
name
replied
the
person
addressed
the
same
who
suggested
whist
if
mr
hatcher
here
continued
has
no
objection
to
the
arrangement
i
not
back
out
doggoned
if
i
do
oh
i
do
care
said
hatcher
in
a
tone
of
reckless
indifference
anything
to
get
up
a
game
now
i
was
never
fond
of
gambling
either
amateur
or
otherwise
but
circumstances
had
made
me
a
tolerable
and
i
knew
there
were
few
who
could
beat
me
at
it
if
my
partner
knew
the
game
as
well
i
felt
certain
we
could
not
be
badly
damaged
and
according
to
all
accounts
he
understood
it
well
this
was
the
opinion
of
one
or
two
of
the
bystanders
who
whispered
in
my
ear
that
he
was
a
whole
team
at
whist
partly
from
the
reckless
mood
i
was
in
partly
that
a
secret
purpose
urged
me
on
a
purpose
which
developed
itself
more
strongly
afterwards
and
partly
that
i
had
been
bantered
and
as
it
were
cornered
into
the
thing
i
consented
to
play
chorley
and
i
hatcher
and
the
we
took
our
seats
partners
the
cards
were
shuffled
cut
dealt
and
the
game
began
chapter
forty
eight
the
game
interrupted
we
played
the
first
two
or
three
games
for
low
stakes
a
dollar
each
this
was
agreeable
to
the
desire
of
hatcher
and
the
who
did
not
like
to
risk
much
as
they
had
nearly
forgotten
the
game
both
however
made
hedge
bets
freely
against
my
partner
chorley
and
against
any
one
who
chose
to
take
them
up
these
bets
were
on
the
the
colour
the
honours
or
the
odd
trick
my
partner
and
i
won
the
two
first
games
and
rapidly
i
noted
several
instances
of
bad
play
on
the
part
of
our
opponent
i
began
to
believe
that
they
really
were
not
a
match
for
us
chorley
said
so
with
an
air
of
triumph
as
though
we
were
playing
merely
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
and
the
stakes
were
of
no
consequence
after
a
while
as
we
won
another
game
he
repeated
the
boast
the
and
his
partner
seemed
to
get
a
little
nettled
it
the
cards
said
the
latter
with
an
air
of
pique
of
coorse
it
the
cards
repeated
had
nothing
but
darned
rubbish
since
the
game
begun
thar
again
bad
cards
again
inquired
his
partner
with
a
sombre
countenance
bad
as
blazes
could
win
with
come
gentlemen
cried
my
partner
chorley
not
exactly
fair
that
no
hints
bah
ejaculated
the
dealer
mout
show
you
my
hand
for
that
matter
thar
ai
a
trick
in
it
we
won
again
our
adversaries
getting
still
more
nettled
at
our
success
now
proposed
doubling
the
stakes
this
was
agreed
to
and
another
game
played
again
chorley
and
i
were
winners
and
the
asked
his
partner
if
he
would
double
again
the
latter
consented
after
a
little
hesitation
as
though
he
thought
the
amount
too
high
of
course
we
the
winners
could
not
object
and
once
more
we
swept
the
as
chorley
euphoniously
expressed
it
the
stakes
were
again
doubled
and
possibly
would
have
increased
in
the
same
ratio
again
and
again
had
i
not
made
a
positive
objection
i
remembered
the
amount
of
cash
i
carried
in
my
pocket
and
knew
that
at
such
a
rate
should
fortune
go
against
us
my
purse
would
not
hold
out
i
consented
however
to
a
stake
of
ten
dollars
each
and
at
this
amount
we
continued
the
play
it
was
well
we
had
not
gone
higher
for
from
this
time
fortune
seemed
to
desert
us
we
lost
almost
every
time
and
at
the
rate
of
ten
dollars
a
game
i
felt
my
purse
grow
sensibly
lighter
i
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
cleared
out
my
partner
hitherto
so
cool
seemed
to
lose
patience
at
intervals
anathematising
the
cards
and
wishing
he
had
never
consented
to
a
game
of
nasty
whist
whether
it
was
this
excitement
that
caused
it
i
could
not
tell
but
certainly
he
played
badly
much
worse
than
at
the
beginning
several
times
he
flung
down
his
cards
without
thought
or
caution
it
seemed
as
if
his
temper
ruffled
at
our
repeated
losses
rendered
him
careless
and
even
reckless
about
the
result
i
was
the
more
surprised
at
this
as
but
an
hour
before
at
euchre
i
had
seen
him
lose
sums
of
double
the
amount
apparently
with
the
utmost
indifference
we
had
not
bad
luck
neither
each
hand
our
cards
were
good
and
several
times
i
felt
certain
we
should
have
won
had
my
partner
played
his
hand
more
skilfully
as
it
was
we
continued
to
lose
until
i
felt
satisfied
that
nearly
half
of
my
money
was
in
the
pockets
of
hatcher
and
the
no
doubt
the
whole
of
it
would
soon
have
found
its
way
into
the
same
receptacles
had
not
our
game
been
suddenly
and
somewhat
mysteriously
interrupted
some
loud
words
were
heard
apparently
from
the
lower
deck
followed
by
a
double
report
as
of
two
pistols
discharged
in
rapid
succession
and
the
moment
after
a
voice
called
out
great
god
there
a
man
shot
the
cards
fell
from
our
fingers
each
seized
his
share
of
the
stakes
springing
to
his
feet
as
he
did
so
and
then
players
backers
and
all
making
for
front
and
side
entrances
rushed
out
of
the
saloon
some
ran
down
stairs
some
sprang
up
to
the
some
took
aft
others
forward
all
crying
out
who
is
it
where
is
he
who
fired
is
he
killed
and
a
dozen
like
interrogatories
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
screams
of
the
ladies
in
their
cabins
the
alarm
of
the
woman
overboard
was
nothing
to
this
new
scene
of
excitement
and
confusion
but
what
was
most
mysterious
was
the
fact
that
no
killed
or
wounded
individual
could
be
found
nor
any
one
who
had
either
fired
a
pistol
or
had
seen
one
fired
no
man
had
been
shot
nor
had
any
man
shot
him
what
the
deuce
could
it
mean
who
had
cried
out
that
some
one
was
shot
that
no
one
could
tell
mystery
indeed
lights
were
carried
round
into
all
the
dark
corners
of
the
boat
but
neither
dead
nor
wounded
nor
trace
of
blood
could
be
discovered
and
at
length
men
broke
out
in
laughter
and
stated
their
belief
that
the
hul
thing
was
a
hoax
so
declared
the
dealer
in
who
seemed
rather
gratified
that
he
no
longer
stood
alone
as
a
contriver
of
false
alarms
chapter
forty
nine
the
sportsmen
of
the
mississippi
before
things
had
reached
this
point
i
had
gained
an
explanation
of
the
mysterious
alarm
i
alone
knew
it
along
with
the
individual
who
had
caused
it
on
hearing
the
shots
i
had
run
forward
under
the
front
awning
and
stood
looking
over
the
guards
i
was
looking
down
upon
the
for
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
loud
words
that
preceded
the
reports
had
issued
thence
though
i
also
thought
that
the
shots
had
been
fired
at
some
point
nearer
most
of
the
people
had
gone
out
by
the
side
entrances
and
were
standing
over
the
gangways
so
that
i
was
alone
in
the
darkness
or
nearly
so
i
had
not
been
many
seconds
in
this
situation
when
some
one
glided
alongside
of
me
and
touched
me
on
the
arm
i
turned
and
inquired
who
it
was
and
what
was
wanted
a
voice
answered
me
in
french
a
friend
monsieur
who
wishes
to
do
you
a
service
ha
that
voice
it
was
you
then
who
called
out
it
was
and
i
who
fired
the
shots
precisely
there
is
no
one
killed
then
not
that
i
know
of
my
pistol
was
pointed
to
the
sky
besides
it
was
loaded
blank
i
glad
of
that
monsieur
but
for
what
purpose
may
i
ask
have
you
simply
to
do
a
service
as
i
have
said
but
how
do
you
contemplate
serving
me
by
firing
off
pistols
and
frightening
the
passengers
of
the
boat
out
of
their
senses
oh
as
to
that
there
no
harm
done
they
soon
got
over
their
little
alarm
i
wanted
to
speak
with
you
alone
i
could
think
of
no
other
device
to
separate
you
from
your
new
acquaintances
the
firing
of
my
pistol
was
only
a
to
effect
that
purpose
it
has
succeeded
you
perceive
ha
monsieur
it
was
you
then
who
whispered
the
word
in
my
ear
as
i
sat
down
to
play
yes
have
i
not
prophesied
truly
so
far
you
have
it
was
you
who
stood
opposite
me
in
the
corner
of
the
saloon
it
was
i
let
me
explain
these
two
last
interrogatories
as
i
was
about
consenting
to
the
game
of
whist
some
one
plucked
my
sleeve
and
whispered
in
french
do
play
monsieur
you
are
certain
to
lose
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
and
saw
a
young
man
just
leaving
my
side
but
was
not
certain
whether
it
was
he
who
had
given
this
prudent
counsel
as
is
known
i
did
not
heed
it
again
while
engaged
in
the
game
i
noticed
this
same
young
man
standing
in
front
of
me
but
in
a
distant
and
somewhat
dark
corner
of
the
saloon
notwithstanding
the
darkness
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
me
as
i
played
this
fact
would
have
drawn
my
attention
of
itself
but
there
was
also
an
expression
in
the
face
that
at
once
fixed
my
interest
and
each
time
while
the
cards
were
being
dealt
i
took
the
opportunity
to
turn
my
eyes
upon
this
strange
individual
he
was
a
slender
youth
under
the
medium
height
and
apparently
scarce
twenty
years
of
age
but
a
melancholy
tone
that
pervaded
his
countenance
made
him
look
a
little
older
his
features
were
small
but
finely
chiselled
the
nose
and
lips
resembling
more
those
of
a
woman
his
cheek
was
almost
colourless
and
dark
silky
hair
fell
in
profuse
curls
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
for
such
at
that
time
was
the
creole
fashion
i
felt
certain
the
youth
was
a
creole
partly
from
his
french
cast
of
countenance
partly
from
the
fashion
and
material
of
his
dress
and
partly
because
he
spoke
french
for
i
was
under
the
impression
it
was
he
who
had
spoken
to
me
his
costume
was
altogether
of
creole
fashion
he
wore
a
blouse
of
brown
linen
not
after
the
mode
of
that
famous
garment
as
known
in
france
but
as
the
creole
with
plaited
body
and
skirt
its
material
moreover
the
fine
unbleached
linen
showed
that
the
style
was
one
of
choice
not
a
mere
necessary
covering
his
pantaloons
were
of
the
finest
the
produce
of
the
looms
of
opelousas
they
were
plaited
very
full
below
the
waist
and
open
at
the
bottoms
with
rows
of
buttons
to
close
them
around
the
ankles
when
occasion
required
there
was
no
vest
its
place
was
supplied
by
ample
frills
of
cambric
lace
that
puffed
out
over
the
breast
the
consisted
of
of
drab
tipped
with
patent
leather
and
fastened
over
the
front
with
a
silk
lace
a
panama
hat
completed
the
dress
and
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
this
truly
southern
costume
there
was
nothing
about
either
the
shirt
the
pantaloons
the
or
all
were
in
keeping
all
were
in
a
style
that
at
that
period
was
the
upon
the
lower
mississippi
it
was
not
therefore
the
dress
of
this
youth
that
had
arrested
my
attention
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
such
every
day
it
could
not
be
that
no
the
dress
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
interest
which
he
had
excited
perhaps
my
regarding
him
as
the
author
of
the
brief
counsel
that
had
been
uttered
in
my
ear
had
a
little
to
do
with
it
but
not
all
independent
of
that
there
was
something
in
the
face
itself
that
forcibly
attracted
my
regard
so
forcibly
that
i
began
to
ponder
whether
i
had
ever
seen
it
before
if
there
had
been
a
better
light
i
might
have
resolved
the
doubt
but
he
stood
in
shadow
and
i
could
not
get
a
fair
view
of
him
it
was
just
about
this
time
that
i
missed
him
from
his
station
in
the
corner
of
the
saloon
and
a
minute
or
two
later
were
heard
the
shouts
and
shots
from
without
and
now
monsieur
may
i
inquire
why
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
and
what
you
have
to
say
i
was
beginning
to
feel
annoyed
at
the
interference
of
this
young
fellow
a
man
does
not
relish
being
suddenly
pulled
up
from
a
game
of
whist
and
not
a
bit
the
more
that
he
has
been
losing
at
it
why
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
is
because
i
feel
an
interest
in
you
what
i
have
to
say
you
shall
hear
an
interest
in
me
and
pray
sir
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
interest
is
it
not
enough
that
you
are
a
stranger
likely
to
be
plundered
of
your
purse
a
how
monsieur
nay
do
not
be
angry
with
me
that
is
the
phrase
which
i
have
heard
applied
to
you
by
more
than
one
of
your
new
acquaintances
if
you
return
to
play
with
them
i
think
you
will
merit
the
title
come
monsieur
this
is
too
bad
you
interfere
in
a
matter
that
does
not
concern
you
true
it
does
not
but
it
concerns
and
yet
ah
i
was
about
to
leave
this
meddling
youth
and
hurry
back
to
the
game
when
the
strange
melancholy
tone
of
his
voice
caused
me
to
hesitate
and
remain
by
him
a
little
longer
well
i
said
you
have
not
yet
told
me
what
you
wished
to
say
indeed
i
have
said
already
i
have
told
you
not
to
play
that
you
would
lose
if
you
did
i
repeat
that
counsel
true
i
have
lost
a
little
but
it
does
not
follow
that
fortune
will
be
always
on
one
side
it
is
rather
my
partner
fault
who
seems
a
bad
player
your
partner
if
i
mistake
not
is
one
of
the
best
players
on
the
river
i
think
i
have
seen
that
gentleman
before
ha
you
know
him
them
something
of
him
not
much
but
that
much
i
know
do
know
him
never
saw
him
before
nor
any
of
the
others
they
are
all
equally
strangers
to
me
you
are
not
aware
then
that
you
are
playing
with
no
but
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
i
am
something
of
a
sportsman
myself
as
fond
of
dogs
horses
and
guns
as
any
of
the
three
i
warrant
ha
monsieur
you
misapprehend
a
sportsman
in
your
country
and
a
sportsman
in
a
mississippi
steamboat
are
two
very
distinct
things
foxes
hares
and
partridges
are
the
game
of
your
sportsman
greenhorns
and
their
purses
are
the
game
of
gentry
like
these
the
men
with
whom
i
am
playing
then
are
professional
gamblers
steamboat
sharpers
are
you
sure
of
this
monsieur
quite
sure
of
it
oh
i
often
travel
up
and
down
to
new
orleans
i
have
seen
them
all
before
but
one
of
them
has
the
look
of
a
farmer
or
a
merchant
as
i
thought
a
from
cincinnati
his
talk
ran
that
way
farmer
merchant
ha
ha
ha
a
farmer
without
acres
a
merchant
without
trade
monsieur
that
old
fellow
is
said
to
be
the
that
is
the
yankee
word
the
smartest
sportsman
in
the
mississippi
valley
and
such
are
not
scarce
i
trow
after
all
they
are
strangers
to
each
other
and
one
of
them
is
my
partner
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
strangers
to
each
other
interrupted
my
new
friend
since
when
have
they
become
acquainted
i
myself
have
seen
the
three
in
company
and
at
the
same
business
almost
every
time
i
have
journeyed
on
the
river
true
they
talk
to
each
other
as
if
they
had
accidentally
met
that
is
part
of
their
arrangement
for
cheating
such
as
you
so
you
believe
they
have
actually
been
cheating
me
since
the
stakes
have
been
raised
to
ten
dollars
they
have
but
how
oh
it
is
very
simple
sometimes
your
partner
designedly
played
the
wrong
card
ha
i
see
now
i
believe
it
it
did
not
need
that
though
even
had
you
had
an
honest
partner
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
in
the
end
your
opponents
have
a
system
of
signals
by
which
they
can
communicate
to
each
other
many
facts
the
sort
of
cards
they
hold
the
colour
of
the
cards
their
value
and
so
forth
you
did
not
observe
how
they
placed
their
fingers
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
did
one
finger
laid
horizontally
denoted
one
trump
two
fingers
placed
in
a
similar
manner
two
trumps
three
for
three
and
so
on
a
slight
curving
of
the
fingers
told
how
many
of
the
trumps
were
honours
a
certain
movement
of
the
thumbs
bespoke
an
ace
and
in
this
way
each
of
your
adversaries
knew
almost
to
a
card
what
his
partner
had
got
it
needed
not
the
third
to
bring
about
the
desired
result
as
it
was
there
were
seven
knaves
about
the
table
four
in
the
cards
and
three
among
the
players
this
is
infamous
true
i
would
have
admonished
you
of
it
sooner
but
of
course
i
could
not
find
an
opportunity
it
would
have
been
no
slight
danger
for
me
to
have
told
you
openly
and
exposed
the
rascals
hence
the
i
have
been
compelled
to
adopt
these
are
no
common
swindlers
any
of
the
three
would
resent
the
slightest
imputation
upon
their
honour
two
of
them
are
noted
duellists
most
likely
i
should
have
been
called
out
and
shot
and
you
would
scarce
have
thanked
me
for
my
my
dear
sir
i
am
exceedingly
grateful
to
you
i
am
convinced
that
what
you
say
is
true
how
would
you
have
me
act
simply
give
up
the
game
let
your
losses
go
you
can
not
recover
them
but
i
am
not
disposed
to
be
thus
outraged
and
plundered
with
impunity
i
shall
try
another
game
watch
them
and
no
you
would
be
foolish
to
do
so
i
tell
you
monsieur
these
men
are
noted
duellists
as
well
as
and
possess
courage
one
of
them
your
partner
has
given
proof
of
it
by
having
travelled
over
three
hundred
miles
to
fight
with
a
gentleman
who
had
slandered
him
or
rather
had
spoken
the
truth
about
him
he
succeeded
moreover
in
killing
his
man
i
tell
you
monsieur
you
can
gain
nothing
by
quarrelling
with
such
men
except
a
fair
chance
of
having
a
bullet
through
you
i
know
you
are
a
stranger
in
our
country
be
advised
then
and
act
as
i
have
said
leave
them
to
their
gains
it
is
late
retire
to
your
and
think
no
more
on
what
you
have
lost
whether
it
was
the
late
excitement
consequent
upon
the
false
alarm
or
whether
it
was
the
strange
development
i
had
just
listened
to
aided
by
the
cool
river
breeze
i
know
not
but
the
intoxication
passed
away
and
my
brain
became
clear
i
doubted
not
for
a
moment
that
the
young
creole
had
told
me
the
truth
his
manner
as
well
as
words
connected
with
the
circumstances
that
had
just
transpired
produced
full
conviction
i
felt
impressed
with
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
to
him
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
and
at
such
risk
to
himself
for
even
the
he
had
adopted
might
have
had
an
awkward
ending
for
him
had
any
one
seen
him
fire
off
his
pistols
why
had
he
acted
thus
why
this
interest
in
my
affairs
had
he
assigned
the
true
reason
was
it
a
feeling
of
pure
chivalry
that
had
prompted
him
i
had
heard
of
just
such
instances
of
noble
nature
among
the
of
louisiana
was
this
another
illustration
of
that
character
i
say
i
was
impressed
with
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
and
resolved
to
follow
his
advice
i
shall
do
as
you
say
i
replied
on
one
condition
name
it
monsieur
that
you
will
give
me
your
address
so
that
when
we
arrive
in
new
orleans
i
may
have
the
opportunity
of
renewing
your
acquaintance
and
proving
to
you
my
gratitude
alas
monsieur
i
have
no
address
i
felt
embarrassed
the
melancholy
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
was
not
to
be
mistaken
some
grief
pressed
heavily
on
that
young
and
generous
heart
it
was
not
for
me
to
inquire
into
its
cause
least
of
all
at
that
time
but
my
own
secret
sorrow
enabled
me
to
sympathise
the
more
deeply
with
others
and
i
felt
i
stood
beside
one
whose
sky
was
far
from
serene
i
felt
embarrassed
by
his
answer
it
left
me
in
a
delicate
position
to
make
reply
i
said
at
length
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
call
upon
me
i
live
at
the
hotel
saint
luis
i
shall
do
so
with
pleasure
night
i
shall
stay
at
home
for
you
monsieur
we
parted
each
taking
the
way
to
his
in
ten
minutes
after
i
lay
in
my
bed
asleep
and
in
ten
hours
after
i
was
drinking
my
in
the
hotel
saint
luis
chapter
fifty
the
city
i
am
strongly
in
favour
of
a
country
life
i
am
a
lover
of
the
chase
and
the
angle
perhaps
if
i
were
to
analyse
the
feeling
i
might
find
that
these
predilections
have
their
source
in
a
purer
fountain
the
love
of
nature
herself
i
follow
the
deer
in
his
tracks
because
they
lead
me
into
the
wildest
solitudes
of
the
forest
i
follow
the
trout
in
its
stream
because
i
am
guided
into
still
retreats
by
the
margin
of
shady
pools
where
human
foot
rarely
treads
once
in
the
haunts
of
the
fish
and
the
game
my
sporting
energy
dies
within
me
my
pierces
the
turf
my
gun
lies
neglected
by
my
side
and
i
yield
up
my
soul
to
a
diviner
dalliance
with
the
beauties
of
nature
oh
i
am
a
rare
lover
of
the
sylvan
scene
and
yet
for
all
this
i
freely
admit
that
the
first
hours
spent
in
a
great
city
have
for
me
a
peculiar
fascination
a
world
of
new
pleasures
is
suddenly
placed
within
reach
a
world
of
luxury
opened
up
the
soul
is
charmed
with
rare
joys
beauty
and
song
wine
and
the
dance
vary
their
allurements
love
or
it
may
be
passion
beguiles
you
into
many
an
incident
of
romantic
adventure
for
romance
may
be
found
within
the
walled
city
the
human
heart
is
its
home
and
they
are
but
quixotic
dreamers
who
fancy
that
steam
and
civilisation
are
antagonistic
to
the
purest
aspirations
of
poetry
a
sophism
indeed
is
the
chivalry
of
the
savage
his
rags
so
picturesque
often
cover
a
shivering
form
and
a
hungry
stomach
soldier
though
i
may
claim
to
be
i
prefer
the
cheering
roll
of
the
busy
mill
to
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
i
regard
the
tall
chimney
with
its
banner
of
black
smoke
a
far
nobler
sight
than
the
fortress
turret
with
its
flouting
and
fickle
flag
i
hear
sweet
music
in
the
plashing
of
the
and
in
my
ears
a
nobler
sound
is
the
scream
of
the
iron
horse
than
the
neigh
of
the
pampered
a
nation
of
monkeys
may
manage
the
business
of
gunpowder
they
must
be
men
to
control
the
more
powerful
element
of
steam
these
ideas
will
not
suit
the
puling
sentimentalism
of
the
boudoir
and
the
the
quixotism
of
the
modern
time
will
be
angry
with
the
rough
writer
who
thus
rudely
lays
his
hand
upon
the
helm
of
the
mailed
knight
and
would
deflower
it
of
its
glory
and
glossy
plumes
it
is
hard
to
yield
up
prejudices
and
preconceptions
however
false
and
the
writer
himself
in
doing
so
confesses
to
the
cost
of
a
struggle
of
no
ordinary
violence
it
was
hard
to
give
up
the
homeric
illusion
and
believe
that
greeks
were
men
not
demigods
hard
to
recognise
in
the
and
the
the
descendants
of
those
heroes
portrayed
in
the
poetic
pictures
of
a
virgil
and
yet
in
the
days
of
my
dreamy
youth
when
i
turned
my
face
to
the
west
i
did
so
under
the
full
conviction
that
the
land
of
prose
was
before
me
and
the
land
of
poetry
behind
my
back
thanks
to
saint
hubert
and
the
golden
ring
of
the
word
mexico
i
did
turn
my
face
in
that
direction
and
no
sooner
had
i
set
foot
on
those
glorious
shores
trodden
by
a
columbus
and
a
cortez
than
i
recognised
the
home
both
of
the
poetic
and
the
picturesque
in
that
very
land
called
prosaic
the
land
of
dollars
i
inhaled
the
very
acme
of
the
poetic
spirit
not
from
the
rhythm
of
books
but
expressed
in
the
most
beautiful
types
of
the
human
form
in
the
noblest
impulses
of
the
human
soul
in
rock
and
stream
in
bird
and
leaf
and
flower
in
that
very
city
which
thanks
to
perjured
and
prejudiced
travellers
i
had
been
taught
to
regard
as
a
sort
of
outcast
camp
i
found
humanity
in
its
fairest
forms
progress
blended
with
pleasure
civilisation
adorned
with
the
spirit
of
chivalry
as
with
a
wreath
prosaic
indeed
a
people
i
make
bold
to
assert
that
in
the
concave
of
that
little
crescent
where
lies
the
city
of
new
orleans
will
be
found
a
psychological
of
greater
variety
and
interest
than
exists
in
any
space
of
equal
extent
on
the
globe
surface
there
the
passions
favoured
by
the
clime
reach
their
fullest
highest
development
love
and
hate
joy
and
grief
avarice
ambition
all
attain
to
perfect
vigour
there
too
the
moral
virtues
are
met
with
in
full
purity
cant
has
there
no
home
hypocrisy
must
be
deep
indeed
to
avoid
exposure
and
punishment
genius
is
almost
universal
universal
too
is
activity
the
stupid
and
the
slothful
can
not
exist
in
this
moving
world
of
busy
life
and
enjoyment
an
ethnological
as
well
this
singular
city
presents
perhaps
no
other
city
exhibits
so
great
a
variety
of
nationalities
as
in
its
streets
founded
by
the
french
held
by
the
spaniards
annexed
by
the
americans
these
three
nations
form
the
elements
of
its
population
but
you
may
nevertheless
there
meet
with
representatives
of
most
other
civilised
and
of
many
savage
people
the

his
turban
the

with
the

the

the
yankee
and
the

an
odd

mosaic
a
mottled
piebald
mixture
is
the
population
of
the
crescent
city
in
truth
new
orleans
is
a
great
metropolis
more
of
a
city
than
places
of
much
greater
population
either
in
europe
or
america
in
passing
through
its
streets
you
feel
that
you
are
not
in

provincial
town

shops
exhibit
the
richest
goods
of
best
workmanship
hotels

architectural
temples
in
which
you
may
witness
the
drama
well
performed
in
french

german
and
english
and
in
its
season
you
may
listen
to
the
music
of
the
italian
opera
if
you
are
a
lover
of
the
terpsichorean
art
you
will
fold
new
orleans
the
town
to
your
taste
i
knew
the
capacities
of
new
orleans
to
afford
pleasure
i
was
acquainted
with
the
sources
of
enjoyment
yet
i
sought
them
not
after
a
long
interval
of
country
life
i
entered
the
city
without
a
thought
of
its
gaieties
a
rare
event
in
the
life
even
of
the
most
sedate
the
masquerades
the
the
drama
the
sweet
strains
of
the
opera
had
lost
their
attractions
for
me
no
amusement
could
amuse
me
at
that
moment
one
thought
alone
had
possession
of
my
heart
aurore
there
was
room
for
no
other
i
pondered
as
to
how
i
should
act
place
yourself
in
my
position
and
you
will
surely
acknowledge
it
a
difficult
one
first
i
was
in
love
with
this
beautiful
quadroon
in
love
beyond
redemption
secondly
she
the
object
of
my
passion
was
for
and
by
thirdly
i
was
jealous
ay
jealous
of
that
which
might
be
sold
and
bought
like
a
bale
of
cotton
a
barrel
of
sugar
fourthly
i
was
still
uncertain
whether
i
should
have
it
in
my
power
to
become
the
purchaser
i
was
still
uncertain
whether
my
banker
letter
had
yet
reached
new
orleans
ocean
steamers
were
not
known
at
this
period
and
the
date
of
a
european
mail
could
not
be
relied
upon
with
any
degree
of
certainty
should
that
not
come
to
hand
in
due
time
then
indeed
should
my
misery
reach
its
culminating
point
some
one
else
would
become
possessed
of
all
i
held
dear
on
earth
would
be
her
lord
and
master
with
power
to
do
aught
oh
god
the
idea
was
fearful
i
could
not
bear
to
dwell
upon
it
again
even
should
my
letter
reach
me
in
time
would
the
amount
i
expected
be
enough
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
five
times
five
hundred
dollars
would
hundred
be
the
price
of
that
which
was
priceless
i
even
doubted
whether
it
would
i
knew
that
a
thousand
dollars
was
at
that
time
the
average
value
of
a
slave
and
it
was
rare
when
one
yielded
twice
that
amount
it
must
be
a
man
a
skilful
mechanic
a
good
blacksmith
an
expert
barber
to
be
worth
such
a
sum
but
for
aurore
oh
i
had
heard
strange
tales
of
fancy
prices
for
such
a
lot
of
brisk
competition
in
the
bidding
of
men
with
long
purses
and
lustful
thoughts
eagerly
contending
for
such
a
prize
such
thoughts
might
harrow
the
soul
even
under
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
what
was
their
effect
upon
me
i
can
not
describe
the
feelings
i
experienced
should
the
sum
reach
me
in
time
should
it
prove
enough
should
i
even
succeed
in
becoming
the
of
aurore
what
then
what
if
my
jealousy
were
well
founded
what
if
she
loved
me
not
worse
dilemma
than
ever
i
should
only
have
her
body
then
her
heart
and
soul
would
be
another
i
should
live
in
exquisite
torture
the
slave
of
a
slave
why
should
i
attempt
to
purchase
her
at
all
why
not
make
a
bold
effort
and
free
myself
from
this
delirious
passion
she
is
not
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
i
would
make
for
her
no
she
has
deceived
me
surely
she
has
deceived
me
why
not
break
my
promise
plighted
though
it
be
in
words
of
fervid
love
why
not
flee
from
the
spot
and
endeavour
to
escape
the
torture
that
is
maddening
both
my
heart
and
brain
oh
why
not
in
calmer
moments
such
questions
might
be
thought
worthy
of
an
answer
i
could
not
answer
them
i
did
not
even
entertain
them

like
shadows
they
flitted
across
my
mind
in

then
state

feelings

had
no
place

would
not

cold
counsels

who
have
passionately
loved

me

the

without

my

at

had
filled
it
with
such
noble
resolves
and
now
to
set
her
free
when
was
this
hideous
exhibition
this
important
sale
to
come
off
when
was
my
betrothed
to
be
sold
and
i
to
assist
at
the
spectacle
i
took
up
the
paper
again
to
ascertain
the
time
and
place
the
place
i
knew
well
the
rotundo
of
the
saint
louis
exchange
adjoining
the
hotel
and
within
twenty
yards
of
where
i
sat
that
was
the
but
the
time
it
was
of
more
importance
indeed
of
all
importance
strange
i
did
not
think
of
this
before
should
it
be
at
an
early
date
and
my
letter
not
have
arrived
i
dared
not
trust
myself
with
such
a
supposition
surely
it
would
be
a
week
several
days
at
the
least
before
a
sale
of
so
much
importance
would
take
place
ha
it
may
have
been
advertised
for
some
days
the
negroes
may
have
been
brought
down
only
at
the
last
moment
my
hands
trembled
as
my
eyes
sought
the
paragraph
at
length
they
rested
upon
it
i
read
with
painful
surprise
at
i
looked
to
the
date
of
the
journal
all
correct
it
was
the
issue
of
that
morning
i
looked
to
the
dial
on
the
wall
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
just
one
day
to
elapse
o
god
if
my
letter
should
not
have
arrived
i
drew
forth
my
purse
and
mechanically
told
over
its
contents
i
knew
not
why
i
did
so
i
knew
it
contained
but
a
hundred
dollars
the
sportsmen
had
reduced
it
in
bulk
when
i
had
finished
counting
it
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
a
hundred
dollars
the
quadroon
housekeeper
etcetera
a
hundred
dollars
the
auctioneer
would
not
be
likely
to
repeat
the
bid
all
now
depended
on
the
english
mail
if
it
had
not
arrived
already
or
did
not
before
the
morning
i
would
be
helpless
without
the
letter
on
my
new
orleans
banker
i
could
not
raise
fifty
pounds
watch
jewels
and
all
as
to
borrowing
i
did
not
think
of
such
a
thing
who
was
to
lend
me
money
who
to
an
almost
perfect
stranger
would
advance
such
a
sum
as
i
required
no
one
i
felt
certain
reigart
could
not
have
helped
me
to
so
large
an
amount
even
had
there
been
time
to
communicate
with
him
no
there
was
no
one
who
that
have
favoured
me
no
one
i
could
think
of
stop
the
banker
himself
happy
thought
the
banker
brown
good
generous
brown
of
the
english
house
brown
and
who
with
smiling
face
has
already
cashed
my
drafts
for
me
he
will
do
it
the
very
man
why
did
i
not
think
of
him
sooner
yes
if
the
letter
have
not
reached
him
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
expect
it
every
day
and
its
amount
he
will
advance
the
money
twelve
gone
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
he
in
his
by
this
i
shall
at
once
apply
to
him
i
seized
my
hat
and
hastening
out
of
the
hotel
took
my
way
through
the
streets
towards
the
of
brown
and
chapter
fifty
two
brown
and
co
the
of
brown
and
was
in
canal
street
from
the
saint
louis
exchange
canal
street
may
be
approached
by
the
rue
conti
or
the
parallel
street
of
the
rue
royale
the
latter
is
the
favourite
promenade
of
the
gay
as
saint
charles
street
is
for
the
fashionable
americans
you
will
wonder
at
this
of
french
and
english
in
the
nomenclature
of
streets
the
truth
is
that
new
orleans
has
a
peculiarity
somewhat
rare
it
is
composed
of
two
distinct
cities
a
french
and
an
american
one
i
might
even
say
for
there
is
a
spanish
quarter
with
a
character
distinct
from
either
and
where
you
may
see
on
the
corner
the
spanish
designation
calle
as
the
de
casacalvo
calle
del
etcetera
this
peculiarity
is
explained
by
referring
to
the
history
of
louisiana
it
was
colonised
by
the
french
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
new
orleans
being
founded
in
the
french
held
louisiana
till
when
it
was
ceded
to
spain
and
remained
in
her
possession
for
a
period
of
nearly
fifty
years
till
when
france
once
more
became
its
master
five
years
after
in
napoleon
sold
this
valuable
country
to
the
american
government
for
of
dollars
the
best
bargain
which
brother
jonathan
has
ever
made
and
apparently
a
slack
one
on
the
part
of
napoleon
after
all
napoleon
was
right
the
sagacious
corsican
no
doubt
foresaw
that
it
could
not
have
long
remained
the
property
of
france
sooner
or
later
the
american
flag
would
wave
over
the
crescent
city
and
napoleon
easy
bargain
has
no
doubt
saved
america
a
war
and
france
a
humiliation
this
change
of
masters
will
explain
the
peculiarity
of
the
population
of
new
orleans
the
characteristics
of
all
three
nations
are
visible
in
its
streets
in
its
houses
in
the
features
habits
and
dress
of
its
citizens
in
nothing
are
the
national
traces
more
distinctly
marked
than
in
the
different
styles
of
architecture
in
the
american
quarter
you
have
tall
brick
dwellings
several
stories
in
height
their
shining
fronts
half
occupied
with
rows
of
windows
combining
the
light
and
ornamental
with
the
substantial
and
useful
this
is
typical
of
the
equally
typical
of
the
french
character
are
the
light
wooden
houses
painted
in
gay
colours
with
green
verandah
palings
windows
that
open
as
doors
and
a
profusion
of
gauzy
curtains
hanging
behind
them
equally
a
type
of
the
grand
solemn
character
of
the
spaniard
are
the
massive
sombre
structures
of
stone
and
lime
of
the
imposing
moorish
style
that
is
still
seen
in
many
of
the
streets
of
new
orleans
of
these
the
great
cathedral
is
a
fine
specimen
that
will
stand
as
a
monument
of
spanish
occupancy
long
after
both
the
spanish
and
french
population
has
been
absorbed
and
melted
down
in
the
alembic
of
the
propagandism
the
american
part
of
new
orleans
is
that
which
is
highest
on
the
river
known
as
the
faubourgs
saint
mary
and
annunciation
canal
street
separates
it
from
the
french
quarter
which
last
is
the
old
city
chiefly
inhabited
by
and
spaniards
a
few
years
ago
the
french
and
american
populations
were
about
equal
now
the
saxon
element
predominates
and
rapidly
absorbs
all
the
others
in
time
the
indolent
creole
must
yield
to
the
more
energetic
american
in
other
words
new
orleans
will
be
americanised
progress
and
civilisation
will
gain
by
this
at
the
expense
according
to
the
sentimental
school
of
the
poetic
and
picturesque
two
distinct
cities
then
are
there
in
new
orleans
each
has
its
exchange
distinct
from
the
other
a
distinct
municipal
court
and
public
offices
each
has
its
centre
of
fashionable
resort
its
favourite
promenade
for
the
of
which
the
metropolis
can
boast
a
large
crowd
its
own
theatres
ballrooms
hotels
and
cafes
in
fact
a
walk
of
a
few
paces
transports
one
into
quite
a
different
world
the
crossing
of
canal
street
is
like
being
transferred
from
broadway
to
the
boulevards
in
their
occupations
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
quarters
the
americans
deal
in
the
strong
staples
of
human
life
the
great
depots
of
provisions
of
cotton
of
tobacco
of
lumber
and
the
various
sorts
of
raw
produce
will
be
found
among
them
on
the
other
hand
the
finer
fabrics
the
laces
the
jewels
the
modes
and
modistes
the
silks
and
satins
and
all
articles
of
and
pass
through
the
lighter
fingers
of
the
creoles
for
these
inherit
both
the
skill
and
taste
of
their
parisian
progenitors
fine
old
rich
too
will
be
found
in
the
french
part
who
have
made
fortunes
by
importing
the
wines
of
bordeaux
and
champagne
for
claret
and
champagne
are
the
wines
that
flow
most
freely
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
a
feeling
of
jealousy
is
not
wanting
between
the
two
races
the
strong
energetic
kentuckian
affects
to
despise
the
gay
frenchman
while
the
latter
particularly
the
old
creole
noblesse
regard
with
contempt
the
of
the
northern
so
that
feuds
and
collisions
between
them
are
not
infrequent
new
orleans
is
the
city
of
the
duello
in
all
matters
of
this
kind
the
kentuckian
finds
the
creole
quite
his
equal
his
full
match
in
spirit
courage
and
skill
i
know
many
creoles
who
are
notorious
for
the
number
of
their
duels
an
or
frequently
causes
half
a
score
or
more
according
to
her
merits
or
mayhap
her
demerits
the
masqued
and
are
also
frequent
scenes
of
quarrel
among
the
bloods
who
frequent
them
let
no
one
fancy
that
life
in
new
orleans
is
without
incident
or
adventure
a
less
prosaic
city
it
would
be
hard
to
find
these
subjects
did
come
before
my
mind
as
i
walked
towards
the
of
brown
and
my
thoughts
were
occupied
with
a
far
different
theme
one
that
caused
me
to
press
on
with
an
agitated
heart
and
hurried
steps
the
walk
was
long
enough
to
give
me
time
for
many
a
hypothetic
calculation
should
my
letter
and
the
bill
of
exchange
have
arrived
i
should
be
put
in
possession
of
funds
at
once
enough
as
i
supposed
for
my
purpose
enough
to
buy
my
if
not
yet
arrived
how
then
would
brown
advance
the
money
my
heart
throbbed
audibly
as
i
asked
myself
this
question
its
answer
affirmative
or
negative
would
be
to
me
like
the
pronouncement
of
a
sentence
of
life
or
death
and
yet
i
felt
more
than
half
certain
that
brown
would
do
so
i
could
not
fancy
his
smiling
generous
face
clouded
with
the
seriousness
of
a
refusal
its
great
importance
to
me
at
that
moment
the
certainty
of
its
being
repaid
and
in
a
few
days
or
hours
at
the
farthest
surely
he
would
not
deny
me
what
to
him
a
man
of
millions
could
be
the
inconvenience
of
advancing
five
hundred
pounds
oh
he
would
do
it
to
a
certainty
no
fear
but
he
would
do
it
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
man
of
money
my
spirits
buoyant
with
sweet
anticipation
when
i
recrossed
it
my
soul
was
saddened
with
bitter
disappointment
my
letter
had
not
yet
arrived
brown
refused
the
advance
i
was
too
inexperienced
in
business
to
comprehend
its
sordid
calculations
its
cold
courtesy
what
cared
the
banker
for
my
pressing
wants
what
to
him
was
my
ardent
appeal
even
had
i
told
him
my
motives
my
object
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
that
game
cold
denying
smile
would
have
been
the
reply
ay
even
had
my
life
depended
upon
it
i
need
not
detail
the
interview
it
was
brief
enough
i
was
told
with
a
bland
smile
that
my
letter
had
not
yet
come
to
hand
to
my
proposal
for
the
advance
the
answer
was
blunt
enough
the
kind
generous
smile
blanked
off
brown
ruddy
face
it
was
not
business
it
could
not
be
done
there
was
no
sign
thrown
out
no
invitation
to
talk
farther
i
might
have
appealed
in
a
more
fervent
strain
i
might
have
confessed
the
purpose
for
which
i
wanted
the
money
but
brown
face
gave
me
no
encouragement
perhaps
it
was
as
well
i
did
not
brown
would
have
chuckled
over
my
delicate
secret
the
town
over
its
would
have
relished
it
as
a
rich
joke
enough
my
letter
had
not
arrived
brown
refused
the
advance
with
hope
behind
me
and
despair
in
front
i
hurried
back
to
the
hotel
chapter
fifty
three
eugene
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
was
occupied
in
searching
for
aurore
i
could
learn
nothing
of
her
not
even
whether
she
had
yet
reached
the
city
in
search
of
her
i
went
to
the
quarters
where
the
others
had
their
temporary
lodgment
she
was
not
these
she
had
either
not
yet
arrived
or
was
kept
at
some
other
place
they
had
not
seen
her
they
knew
nothing
about
her
disappointed
and
wearied
with
running
through
the
hot
and
dusty
streets
i
returned
to
the
hotel
i
waited
for
night
i
waited
for
the
coming
of
eugene
for
such
was
the
name
of
my
new
acquaintance
i
was
strangely
interested
in
this
young
man
our
short
interview
had
inspired
me
with
a
singular
confidence
in
him
he
had
given
proof
of
a
friendly
design
towards
me
and
still
more
had
impressed
me
with
a
high
idea
of
his
knowledge
of
the
world
young
as
he
was
i
could
not
help
fancying
him
a
being
possessed
of
some
mysterious
power
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
in
some
way
he
might
aid
me
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
his
being
so
young
and
still
to
all
the
mysteries
of
life
precocity
is
the
privilege
of
the
american
especially
the
native
of
new
orleans
a
creole
at
fifteen
is
a
man
i
felt
satisfied
that
about
my
own
age
knew
far
more
of
the
world
than
i
who
had
been
half
my
life
cloistered
within
the
walls
of
an
antique
university
i
had
an
instinct
that
he
both
and
serve
me
how
you
may
ask
by
lending
me
the
money
i
required
it
could
not
be
thus
i
believed
that
he
was
himself
without
funds
or
possessed
of
but
little
far
too
little
to
be
of
use
to
me
my
reason
for
thinking
so
was
the
reply
he
had
made
when
i
asked
for
his
address
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
his
answer
that
led
me
to
the
thought
that
he
was
without
fortune
even
without
a
home
perhaps
a
clerk
out
of
place
thought
i
or
a
poor
artist
his
dress
was
rich
enough
but
dress
is
no
criterion
on
a
mississippi
steamboat
with
these
reflections
it
was
strange
i
should
have
been
impressed
with
the
idea
could
serve
me
but
i
was
so
and
had
therefore
resolved
to
make
him
the
confidant
of
my
secret
the
secret
of
my
love
the
secret
of
my
misery
perhaps
another
impulse
acted
upon
me
and
aided
in
bringing
me
to
this
determination
he
whose
heart
has
been
charged
with
a
deep
grief
must
know
the
relief
which
sympathy
can
afford
the
sympathy
of
friendship
is
sweet
and
soothing
there
is
balm
in
the
counsel
of
a
kind
companion
my
sorrow
had
been
long
pent
up
within
my
own
bosom
and
yearned
to
find
expression
stranger
among
strangers
i
had
no
one
to
share
it
with
me
even
to
the
good
reigart
i
had
not
confessed
myself
with
the
exception
of
aurore
herself
eugenie
poor
eugenie
was
alone
mistress
of
my
secret
would
that
she
of
all
had
never
known
it
now
to
this
youth
eugene
strange
coincidence
of
name
i
was
resolved
to
impart
it
resolved
to
unburden
my
heart
perhaps
in
so
doing
i
might
find
consolation
or
relief
i
waited
for
the
night
it
was
at
night
he
had
promised
to
come
i
waited
with
impatience
with
my
eyes
bent
almost
continuously
on
the
index
finger
of
time
and
chafing
at
the
slow
measured
strokes
of
the
pendulum
i
was
not
disappointed
he
came
at
length
his
silvery
voice
rang
in
my
ears
and
he
stood
before
me
as
he
entered
my
room
i
was
once
more
struck
with
the
melancholy
expression
of
his
countenance
the
pale
cheek
the
resemblance
to
some
face
i
had
met
before
the
room
was
close
and
hot
the
summer
had
not
yet
quite
departed
i
proposed
a
walk
we
could
converse
as
freely
in
the
open
air
and
there
was
a
lovely
moon
to
light
us
on
our
way
as
we
sallied
forth
i
offered
my
visitor
a
cigar
this
he
declined
giving
his
reason
he
did
not
smoke
strange
thought
i
for
one
of
a
race
who
almost
universally
indulge
in
the
habit
another
peculiarity
in
the
character
of
my
new
acquaintance
we
passed
up
the
rue
royale
and
turned
along
canal
street
in
the
direction
of
the
swamp
presently
we
crossed
the
rue
des
rampartes
and
soon
found
ourselves
outside
the
limits
of
the
city
some
buildings
appeared
beyond
but
they
were
not
houses
at
least
not
for
the
living
the
numerous
cupolas
crowned
with
crosses
the
broken
columns
the
monuments
of
white
marble
gleaming
under
the
moon
told
us
that
we
looked
upon
a
city
of
the
dead
it
was
the
great
cemetery
of
new
orleans
that
cemetery
where
the
poor
after
death
are
and
the
rich
fare
no
better
for
they
are
the
gate
stood
open
the
scene
within
invited
me
its
solemn
character
was
in
unison
with
my
spirit
my
companion
made
no
objection
and
we
entered
after
wending
our
way
among
tombs
and
statues
and
monuments
miniature
temples
columns
obelisks
sarcophagi
carved
in
marble
passing
graves
that
spoke
of
recent
affliction
others
of
older
date
but
garnished
with
fresh
flowers
the
symbols
of
lore
or
affection
that
still
lingered
we
seated
ourselves
upon
a
slab
with
the
fronds
of
the
babylonian
willow
waving
above
our
heads
and
drooping
mournfully
around
us
chapter
fifty
four
pity
for
love
along
the
way
we
had
conversed
upon
several
topics
indifferently
of
my
gambling
adventure
on
the
boat
of
the
sportsmen
of
new
orleans
of
the
fine
moonlight
until
after
entering
the
cemetery
and
taking
our
seats
upon
the
tomb
i
had
disclosed
nothing
of
that
which
altogether
engrossed
my
thoughts
the
time
had
now
arrived
for
unbosoming
myself
and
after
eugene
knew
the
story
of
my
love
i
confided
to
him
all
that
had
occurred
from
the
time
of
my
leaving
new
orleans
up
to
the
period
of
our
meeting
upon
the
houma
my
interview
with
the
banker
brown
and
my
fruitless
search
that
day
for
aurore
were
also
detailed
from
first
to
last
he
listened
without
interrupting
me
only
once
when
i
described
the
scene
of
my
confession
to
eugenie
and
its
painful
ending
the
details
of
this
seemed
to
interest
him
exceedingly
in
fact
to
give
him
pain
more
than
once
i
was
interrupted
by
his
sobs
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
could
see
that
he
was
in
tears
noble
youth
thought
i
thus
to
be
affected
by
the
sufferings
of
a
stranger
poor
eugenie
murmured
he
is
not
to
be
pitied
pitied
ah
monsieur
you
know
not
how
much
i
pity
her
that
scene
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
if
pity
friendship
any
sacrifice
could
make
amends
how
willingly
would
i
bestow
it
upon
her
all
but
that
which
is
not
in
my
power
to
give
my
love
deeply
monsieur
deeply
do
i
grieve
for
that
noble
lady
oh
that
i
could
pluck
the
sting
from
her
heart
which
i
have
been
the
innocent
cause
of
placing
there
but
surely
she
will
recover
from
this
unfortunate
passion
surely
in
time
ah
never
never
interrupted
with
an
earnestness
of
manner
that
surprised
me
why
say
you
so
monsieur
why
because
i
have
some
skill
in
such
affairs
young
as
you
think
me
have
experienced
a
similar
misfortune
poor
eugenie
a
wound
is
hard
to
she
will
not
recover
from
it
ah
never
indeed
i
pity
her
with
my
whole
soul
i
pity
her
you
should
seek
her
and
say
so
why
i
asked
somewhat
astonished
at
the
suggestion
perhaps
your
pity
expressed
to
her
might
give
consolation
impossible
it
would
have
the
contrary
effect
you
misjudge
monsieur
unrequited
love
is
far
less
hard
to
bear
when
it
meets
with
sympathy
it
is
only
haughty
contempt
and
heartless
triumph
that
wring
from
the
heart
sympathy
is
balm
to
the
wounds
of
love
believe
me
it
is
so
feel
it
to
be
so
oh
i
feel
it
to
so
the
last
two
phrases
he
spoke
with
an
earnestness
that
sounded
strangely
in
my
ears
mysterious
youth
thought
i
so
gentle
so
compassionate
and
yet
so
i
felt
as
though
i
conversed
with
some
spiritual
being
some
superior
mind
who
comprehended
all
his
doctrine
was
new
to
me
and
quite
contrary
to
the
general
belief
at
a
later
period
of
my
life
i
became
convinced
of
its
truth
if
i
thought
my
sympathy
would
have
such
an
effect
replied
i
i
should
seek
eugenie
i
should
offer
her
there
will
be
a
time
for
that
afterward
said
interrupting
me
your
present
business
is
more
pressing
you
purpose
to
this
i
did
so
this
morning
alas
i
have
no
longer
a
hope
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
how
much
money
have
these
sharpers
left
you
not
much
over
one
hundred
dollars
ha
that
will
not
do
from
your
description
of
her
she
will
bring
ten
times
the
amount
a
misfortune
indeed
my
own
purse
is
still
lighter
than
yours
i
have
not
a
hundred
dollars
it
is
a
sad
affair
pressed
his
head
between
his
hands
and
remained
for
some
moments
silent
apparently
in
deep
meditation
from
his
manner
i
could
not
help
believing
that
he
really
sympathised
with
me
and
that
he
was
thinking
of
some
plan
to
assist
me
after
all
he
muttered
to
himself
just
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
what
was
said
if
she
should
not
succeed
if
she
should
not
find
the
papers
then
she
too
must
be
a
sacrifice
oh
it
is
a
terrible
risk
it
might
be
better
not
it
might
be
monsieur
i
said
interrupting
him
of
what
are
you
speaking
oh
ah
pardon
me
it
is
an
affair
i
was
thinking
of
we
had
better
return
monsieur
it
is
cold
the
atmosphere
of
this
solemn
place
chills
me
he
said
all
this
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
as
though
he
had
been
speaking
his
thoughts
unintentionally
though
astonished
at
what
he
had
uttered
i
could
not
press
him
for
an
explanation
but
yielding
to
his
wish
i
rose
up
to
depart
i
had
lost
hope
plainly
he
had
it
not
in
his
power
to
serve
me
at
this
moment
a
resource
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
or
rather
the
forlorn
hope
of
a
resource
i
communicated
it
to
my
companion
i
have
still
these
two
hundred
dollars
said
i
they
are
of
no
more
service
to
me
for
the
purchase
of
aurore
than
if
they
were
so
many
pebbles
suppose
i
try
to
increase
the
amount
at
the
oh
i
fear
it
would
be
an
idle
attempt
you
would
lose
as
before
that
is
not
so
certain
monsieur
the
chances
at
least
are
equal
i
need
not
play
with
men
of
skill
like
those
upon
the
boat
here
in
new
orleans
there
are
plenty
of
them
where
of
are
carried
on
these
are
of
various
kinds
as
craps
and
i
can
choose
some
one
of
these
where
bets
are
made
on
the
tossing
of
a
die
or
the
turning
of
a
card
it
is
just
as
likely
i
may
win
as
lose
what
say
you
monsieur
give
me
your
counsel
you
speak
truly
replied
he
there
is
a
chance
in
the
game
it
offers
a
hope
of
your
winning
if
you
lose
you
will
be
no
worse
off
as
regards
your
intentions
for
if
you
win
true
true
if
i
win
you
must
not
lose
time
then
it
is
growing
late
these
should
be
open
at
this
hour
no
doubt
they
are
now
in
the
very
tide
of
their
business
let
us
find
one
you
will
go
with
me
thanks
monsieur
thanks
we
hastily
traversed
the
walk
that
led
to
the
entrance
of
the
cemetery
and
issuing
from
the
gate
took
our
way
back
into
the
town
we
headed
for
our
point
of
departure
the
rue
saint
louis
for
i
knew
that
in
that
neighbourhood
lay
the
principal
gambling
hells
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
them
at
that
period
there
was
no
concealment
required
in
such
matters
the
gambling
passion
among
the
creoles
inherited
from
the
original
possessors
of
the
city
was
too
rife
among
all
classes
to
be
put
down
by
a
police
the
municipal
authorities
in
the
american
quarter
had
taken
some
steps
toward
the
suppression
of
this
vice
but
their
laws
had
no
force
on
the
french
side
of
canal
street
and
creole
police
had
far
different
ideas
as
well
as
different
instructions
in
the
french
faubourgs
gaming
was
not
considered
so
hideous
a
crime
and
the
houses
appropriated
to
it
were
open
and
avowed
as
you
passed
along
rue
conti
or
saint
louis
or
the
rue
bourbon
you
could
not
fail
to
notice
several
large
gilded
lamps
upon
which
you
might
read
faro
and
craps
loto
or
roulette
odd
words
to
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
but
well
enough
understood
by
those
whose
business
it
was
to
traverse
the
streets
of
the
first
municipality
our
hurrying
stops
soon
brought
us
in
front
of
one
of
these
establishments
whose
lamp
told
us
in
plain
letters
that
faro
was
played
inside
it
was
the
first
that
offered
and
without
hesitating
a
moment
i
entered
followed
by
we
had
to
climb
a
wide
stairway
at
the
top
of
which
we
were
received
by
a
whiskered
and
moustached
fellow
in
waiting
i
supposed
that
he
was
about
to
demand
some
fee
for
admission
i
was
mistaken
in
my
conjecture
admission
was
perfectly
free
the
purpose
of
this
individual
in
staying
us
was
to
divest
us
of
arms
for
which
he
handed
us
a
ticket
that
we
might
reclaim
them
in
going
out
that
he
had
disarmed
a
goodly
number
before
our
turn
came
was
evident
from
the
numerous
butts
of
pistols
hafts
of
and
handles
of
daggers
that
protruded
from
the
of
a
structure
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
passage
the
whole
proceeding
reminded
me
of
the
scenes
i
had
often
witnessed
the
surrender
of
canes
umbrellas
and
parasols
on
entering
a
or
a
museum
no
doubt
it
was
a
necessary
precaution
the
of
which
would
have
led
to
many
a
scene
of
blood
over
the
we
yielded
up
our
weapons
i
a
pair
of
pistols
and
my
companion
a
small
silver
dagger
these
were
ticketed
duplicates
delivered
to
us
and
we
were
allowed
to
pass
on
into
the
chapter
fifty
five
on
games
and
gambling
the
passion
of
gaming
is
universal
amongst
men
every
nation
indulges
in
it
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
every
nation
civilised
or
savage
has
its
game
from
whist
and
cribbage
at
almacks
to
and
upon
the
prairies
moral
england
fancies
herself
clear
of
the
stain
her
gossiping
traveller
rarely
fails
to
fling
a
stone
at
the
foreigner
on
this
head
french
german
spaniard
and
mexican
are
in
turn
accused
of
an
undue
propensity
for
this
vice
cant
all
cant
there
is
more
gambling
in
moral
england
than
in
any
country
of
my
knowing
i
do
not
speak
of
about
the
purlieus
of
piccadilly
go
to
epsom
races
on
a
derby
day
and
there
you
may
form
an
idea
of
the
scale
upon
which
english
gaming
is
carried
on
for
gaming
it
is
in
the
very
lowest
sense
of
the
word
talk
of
noble
sport
of
an
admiration
for
that
fine
animal
the
horse
bah
noble
indeed
fancy
those
seedy
scamps
who
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
flock
upon
every
fancy
them
and
their
harlotic
companions
possessed
with
the
idea
of
anything
fine
or
noble
of
all
who
crowd
there
the
horse
alone
is
noble
naught
could
be
more
ignoble
than
his
no
moral
england
you
are
no
pattern
for
the
nations
in
this
respect
you
are
not
free
from
the
stain
as
you
imagine
yourself
you
have
a
larger
population
of
gamblers
if
you
will
than
any
other
people
and
however
noble
be
your
game
i
make
bold
to
affirm
that
your
gamesters
are
the
seediest
snobbiest
and
most
revolting
of
the
tribe
there
is
something
indescribably
mean
in
the
life
and
habits
of
those
vultures
who
hang
about
the
corners
of
coventry
street
and
the
haymarket
out
at
elbows
out
at
heels
sneaking
from
tavern
to
and
from
to
tavern
there
is
a
meanness
a
positive
cowardice
in
the
very
nature
of
their
game
their
small
ventures
and
timid
hedging
of
bets
in
comparison
the
bold
ringer
of
dice
has
something
noble
in
him
your
apathetic
don
who
stakes
his
gold
onzas
on
a
single
throw
of
the
ivory
your
mexican
who
risks
his
doubloons
on
each
turn
of
the
cards
are
to
some
extent
dignified
by
the
very
boldness
of
their
venture
with
them
gambling
is
a
passion
its
excitement
their
lure
but
brown
and
smith
and
jones
can
not
even
plead
even
would
exalt
them
of
all
gamblers
by
profession
the
sportsman
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
i
have
already
alluded
to
their
elegant
style
of
attire
but
independent
of
that
there
is
a
dash
of
the
gentleman
a
certain
of
character
which
distinguishes
them
from
all
others
of
their
calling
during
the
wilder
episodes
of
my
life
i
have
been
with
the
acquaintance
of
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
can
not
help
bearing
a
somewhat
high
testimony
in
their
favour
several
have
i
met
of
excellent
moral
character
though
perhaps
not
quite
up
to
the
standard
of
exeter
hall
some
i
have
known
of
noble
and
generous
hearts
doers
of
noble
actions
who
though
outcasts
in
society
were
not
outcasts
to
their
own
natures
men
who
would
bravely
resent
the
slightest
insult
that
might
be
put
upon
them
of
course
there
were
others
as
the
chorleys
and
hatchers
who
would
scarce
answer
to
this
description
of
western
sportsmen
but
i
really
believe
that
such
are
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
a
word
about
the
games
of
america
the
true
national
game
of
the
united
states
is
the
election
the
local
or
state
elections
afford
so
many
opportunities
of
betting
just
as
the
minor
do
in
england
while
the
great
quadrennial
the
presidential
election
is
the
derby
day
of
america
the
enormous
sums
that
change
hands
upon
such
occasions
and
the
enormous
number
of
them
would
be
incredible
a
statistic
of
these
bets
could
such
be
given
and
their
amount
would
surprise
even
the
most
enlightened
citizen
of
the
states
themselves
foreigners
can
not
understand
the
intense
excitement
which
is
felt
during
an
election
time
throughout
the
united
states
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
it
in
a
country
where
men
generally
know
that
the
fate
of
the
particular
candidate
has
after
all
but
a
slight
influence
on
their
material
interests
true
party
spirit
and
the
great
stake
of
all
the
spoils
of
office
will
account
for
some
of
the
interest
taken
in
the
result
but
not
for
all
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
balance
of
the
excitement
may
be
set
down
to
the
credit
of
the
gaming
passion
nearly
every
second
man
you
meet
has
a
bet
or
rather
a
book
upon
the
presidential
election
election
therefore
is
the
true
national
game
indulged
in
by
high
low
rich
and
poor
to
bet
upon
an
election
however
is
not
considered
it
is
not
gambling
the
games
for
that
purpose
are
of
various
kinds
in
most
of
which
cards
are
relied
upon
to
furnish
the
chances
dice
and
billiards
are
also
in
vogue
billiards
to
a
considerable
extent
it
is
a
very
mean
village
in
the
united
states
particularly
in
the
south
and
west
that
does
not
furnish
one
or
more
public
and
among
americans
may
be
found
some
of
the
most
expert
crack
players
in
the
world
the
creoles
of
louisiana
are
distinguished
at
this
game
is
also
a
very
general
game
and
every
town
has
its
alley
but
billiards
and
are
not
true
gambling
games
the
first
is
patronised
rather
as
an
elegant
amusement
and
the
latter
as
an
excellent
exercise
cards
and
dice
are
the
real
weapons
of
the
sportsman
but
particularly
the
former
besides
the
english
games
of
whist
and
cribbage
and
the
french
games
of
etcetera
the
american
gambler
plays
poker
euchre
and
a
variety
of
others
in
new
orleans
there
is
a
favourite
of
the
creoles
called
craps
a
dice
game
and
keno
and
loto
and
roulette
played
with
balls
and
a
revolving
wheel
farther
to
the
south
among
the
you
meet
the
game
of
monte
a
card
game
distinct
from
all
the
others
monte
is
the
national
game
of
mexico
to
all
other
modes
of
getting
at
your
money
the
sportsman
prefers
faro
it
is
a
game
of
spanish
origin
as
its
name
imports
indeed
it
differs
but
little
from
monte
and
was
no
doubt
obtained
from
the
spaniards
of
new
orleans
whether
native
or
exotic
to
the
towns
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
all
of
them
it
has
become
perfectly
naturalised
and
there
is
no
sportsman
of
the
west
who
does
not
understand
and
practise
it
the
game
of
faro
is
simple
enough
the
following
are
its
leading
features
a
green
cloth
or
baize
covers
the
table
upon
this
the
thirteen
cards
of
a
suite
are
laid
out
in
two
rows
with
their
faces
turned
up
they
are
usually
attached
to
the
cloth
by
gum
to
prevent
them
from
getting
out
of
place
a
square
box
like
an
overgrown
is
next
produced
it
is
of
the
exact
size
and
shape
to
hold
two
packs
of
cards
it
is
of
solid
silver
any
other
metal
would
serve
as
well
but
a
professed
faro
dealer
would
scorn
to
carry
a
mean
implement
of
his
calling
the
object
of
this
box
is
to
hold
the
cards
to
be
dealt
and
to
assist
in
dealing
them
i
can
not
explain
the
internal
mechanism
of
this
mysterious
box
but
i
can
say
that
it
is
without
a
lid
open
at
one
edge
where
the
cards
are
pressed
in
and
contains
an
interior
spring
which
touched
by
the
finger
of
the
dealer
pushes
out
the
cards
one
by
one
as
they
lie
in
the
pack
this
contrivance
is
not
at
all
essential
to
the
game
which
may
be
played
without
the
box
its
object
is
to
insure
a
fair
deal
as
no
card
can
be
recognised
by
any
mark
on
its
back
since
up
to
the
moment
of
drawing
they
are
all
invisible
within
the
box
a
stylish
faro
box
is
the
ambition
of
every
faro
dealer
the
specific
title
of
all
sportsmen
whose
game
is
faro
two
packs
of
cards
well
shuffled
are
first
put
into
the
box
and
the
dealer
resting
the
left
hand
upon
it
and
holding
the
right
in
readiness
with
the
thumb
extended
pauses
a
moment
until
some
bets
are
made
the
dealer
is
in
reality
your
antagonist
in
the
game
he
is
the
banker
who
pays
all
your
gains
and
pockets
all
your
losses
as
many
may
bet
as
can
sit
or
stand
around
the
table
but
all
are
betting
against
the
dealer
himself
of
course
in
this
case
the
faro
dealer
must
be
something
of
a
proprietor
to
play
the
game
at
all
and
the
faro
bank
has
usually
a
capital
of
several
thousands
of
dollars
often
hundreds
of
thousands
to
back
it
not
unfrequently
after
an
unlucky
run
the
bank
gets
broke
and
the
proprietor
of
it
may
be
years
before
he
can
establish
another
an
assistant
or
croupier
usually
sits
beside
the
dealer
his
business
is
to
exchange
the
cheques
for
money
to
pay
the
bets
lost
and
gather
in
those
which
the
bank
has
won
the
cheques
used
in
the
game
are
pieces
of
ivory
of
circular
form
of
the
diameter
of
dollars
they
are
white
red
or
blue
with
the
value
engraved
upon
them
and
they
are
used
as
being
more
convenient
than
the
money
itself
when
any
one
wishes
to
leave
off
playing
he
can
demand
from
the
bank
to
the
amount
specified
on
the
cheques
he
may
then
hold
the
simplest
method
of
betting
against
faro
is
by
placing
the
money
on
the
face
of
any
particular
one
of
the
cards
that
lie
on
the
table
you
may
choose
which
you
will
of
the
thirteen
say
you
have
selected
the
ace
and
placed
your
money
upon
the
face
of
that
card
the
dealer
then
commences
and
draws
the
cards
out
of
the
box
one
by
one
after
drawing
each
two
he
makes
a
pause
until
two
aces
follow
each
other
with
no
other
card
between
there
is
no
decision
when
two
aces
come
together
the
bet
is
declared
if
both
appear
in
the
drawing
of
the
two
cards
then
the
dealer
takes
your
money
if
only
one
is
pulled
out
and
the
other
follows
in
the
next
drawing
you
have
won
you
may
then
renew
your
bet
upon
the
ace
double
it
if
you
will
or
remove
it
to
any
other
card
and
these
changes
you
may
make
at
any
period
of
the
deal
provided
it
is
not
done
after
the
first
of
the
two
cards
has
been
drawn
of
course
the
game
goes
on
whether
you
play
or
not
the
table
is
surrounded
by
betters
some
on
one
card
some
on
another
some
by
paralee
on
two
or
more
cards
at
a
time
so
that
there
is
a
constant
falling
due
of
bets
a
constant
rattling
of
cheques
and
chinking
of
dollars
it
is
all
a
game
of
chance
skill
has
naught
to
do
with
the
game
of
faro
and
you
might
suppose
as
many
do
that
the
chances
are
exactly
equal
for
the
dealer
and
his
opponents
such
however
is
not
the
case
a
peculiar
arrangement
of
the
cards
produces
a
percentage
in
favour
of
the
former
else
there
would
be
no
faro
bank
and
although
a
rare
run
of
may
go
against
the
dealer
for
a
time
if
he
can
only
hold
out
long
enough
he
is
bound
to
beat
you
in
the
end
a
similar
percentage
will
be
against
you
in
all
games
of
chance
faro
monte
or
craps
wherever
you
bet
against
a
banker
of
course
the
banker
will
not
deny
this
but
answers
you
that
that
percentage
is
to
pay
for
the
game
it
usually
does
and
well
such
is
faro
the
game
at
which
i
had
resolved
to
empty
my
purse
or
win
the
price
of
my
betrothed
chapter
fifty
six
the
faro
bank
we
entered
the
saloon
the
game
at
one
end
was
the
table
the
bank
we
could
see
neither
bank
nor
dealer
both
were
hidden
by
the
double
ring
of
bettors
who
encircled
the
table
one
line
seated
the
other
standing
behind
there
were
women
too
mingled
in
the
crowd
seated
and
standing
in
every
attitude
gay
and
beautiful
women
decked
out
in
the
finery
of
fashion
but
with
a
certain
of
manner
that
betokened
their
unfortunate
character
had
guessed
aright
the
game
was
at
its
height
the
look
and
attitudes
of
the
betters
their
arms
constantly
in
motion
placing
their
stakes
the
incessant
rattling
of
the
ivory
cheques
and
the
clinking
together
of
dollars
all
told
that
the
game
was
progressing
briskly
a
grand
chandelier
suspended
above
the
table
cast
its
brilliant
light
over
the
play
and
the
players
near
the
middle
of
the
saloon
stood
a
large
table
amply
furnished
with
refreshments
cold
fowls
ham
and
tongue
chicken
salad
and
lobsters
decanters
tilled
with
wine
brandy
and
other
liquors
garnished
this
table
some
of
the
plates
and
glasses
bore
the
traces
of
having
been
already
used
while
others
were
clean
and
ready
for
anyone
who
chose
to
play
knife
and
fork
a
while
it
was
in
fact
a
free
lunch
or
rather
supper
free
to
any
guest
who
chose
to
partake
of
it
such
is
the
custom
of
an
american
the
rich
viands
did
not
tempt
either
my
companion
or
myself
we
passed
the
table
without
halting
and
walked
directly
up
to
the
bank
we
reached
the
outer
circle
and
looked
over
the
shoulders
of
the
players
of
fortuna
chorley
and
yes
there
sat
the
two
sharpers
side
by
side
behind
the
not
as
mere
bettors
but
acting
respectively
as
banker
and
croupier
of
the
game
chorley
held
the
in
his
fingers
while
hatcher
sat
upon
his
right
with
cheques
dollars
and
piled
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
a
glance
around
the
ring
of
faces
showed
us
the
as
well
there
sat
he
in
his
loose
jeans
coat
and
broad
talking
betting
bravely
and
altogether
a
stranger
to
both
banker
and
croupier
my
companion
and
i
regarded
each
other
with
a
look
of
surprise
after
all
there
was
nothing
to
surprise
us
a
faro
bank
needs
no
charter
no
further
preliminaries
to
its
establishment
than
to
light
up
a
table
spread
a
green
baize
over
it
and
commence
operations
the
sportsmen
were
no
doubt
quite
at
home
here
their
excursion
was
only
by
way
of
a
little
variety
an
interlude
incidental
to
the
summer
the
season
of
new
orleans
was
now
commencing
and
they
had
just
returned
in
time
for
it
therefore
there
was
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
in
our
finding
them
where
we
did
at
first
seeing
them
however
i
felt
astonishment
and
my
companion
seemed
to
share
it
i
turned
towards
him
and
was
about
proposing
that
we
should
leave
the
room
again
when
the
wandering
eye
of
the
pseudo
fell
upon
me
hilloa
stranger
he
cried
out
with
an
air
of
astonishment
you
hyar
i
believe
so
i
replied
unconcernedly
wal
wal
i
you
war
lost
whar
did
you
go
anyhow
he
inquired
in
a
tone
of
vulgar
familiarity
and
loud
enough
to
turn
the
attention
of
all
present
upon
myself
and
my
companion
ay
did
i
go
i
responded
keeping
my
temper
and
concealing
the
annoyance
i
really
felt
at
the
fellow
impudence
yes
that
jest
what
i
wanted
to
know
are
you
very
anxious
i
asked
oh
no
not
particklerly
so
i
am
glad
of
that
i
responded
as
i
do
intend
telling
you
with
all
his
swagger
i
could
see
that
his
crest
fell
a
little
at
the
general
burst
of
laughter
that
my
somewhat
remark
had
called
forth
come
stranger
he
said
in
a
tone
you
need
a
be
so
about
it
i
guess
i
did
mean
no
offence
but
you
know
you
left
us
so
suddintly
never
mind
no
business
o
mine
you
going
to
take
a
hand
at
faro
ai
you
perhaps
wal
then
it
appears
a
nice
game
i
jest
trying
it
for
the
first
time
myself
it
all
chance
i
believe
jest
like
odds
and
evens
a
winnin
anyhow
he
turned
his
face
to
the
bank
and
appeared
to
busy
himself
in
arranging
his
bets
a
fresh
deal
had
commenced
and
the
players
drawn
off
for
a
moment
by
our
conversation
became
once
more
engaged
in
what
was
of
greater
interest
to
them
the
little
upon
the
cards
of
course
both
chorley
and
hatcher
recognised
me
but
they
had
restricted
their
recognitions
to
a
friendly
nod
and
a
glance
that
plainly
said
he
here
all
right
he
not
go
till
he
has
tried
to
get
back
his
hundred
dollars
he
have
a
shy
at
the
bank
no
fear
but
he
will
if
such
were
their
thoughts
they
were
not
far
astray
my
own
reflections
were
as
follows
i
may
as
well
risk
my
money
here
as
elsewhere
a
faro
bank
is
a
faro
bank
all
the
same
there
is
no
opportunity
for
cheating
where
cards
are
thus
dealt
the
arrangement
of
the
bets
precludes
every
possibility
of
such
a
thing
where
one
player
loses
to
the
bank
another
may
win
from
it
by
the
very
same
turn
and
this
of
course
checks
the
dealer
from
drawing
the
cards
falsely
even
if
it
were
possible
for
him
to
do
so
so
i
may
as
well
play
against
chorley
and
hatcher
bank
as
any
other
better
indeed
for
if
i
am
to
win
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
the
which
those
gentlemen
owe
me
i
shall
play
here
then
do
you
advise
me
monsieur
part
of
the
above
reflections
and
the
interrogatory
that
wound
them
up
were
addressed
in
a
whisper
to
the
young
creole
he
acknowledged
their
justice
he
advised
me
to
remain
he
was
of
the
opinion
i
might
as
well
tempt
fortune
there
as
go
farther
enough
i
took
out
a
and
placed
it
upon
the
ace
no
notice
was
taken
of
this
neither
banker
nor
croupier
even
turning
their
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
bet
such
a
sum
as
five
dollars
would
not
decompose
the
nerves
of
these
gentlemen
where
sums
of
ten
twenty
or
even
fifty
times
the
amount
were
constantly
passing
to
and
from
their
the
deal
proceeded
chorley
drawing
the
cards
with
that
air
of
imperturbable
so
characteristic
of
his
class
ace
wins
cried
a
voice
as
two
aces
came
forth
together
pay
you
in
cheques
sir
asked
the
croupier
i
assented
and
a
flat
round
piece
of
ivory
of
a
red
colour
with
the
figure
in
its
centre
was
placed
upon
my
i
permitted
both
to
remain
upon
the
ace
the
deal
went
on
and
after
a
while
two
aces
came
out
together
and
two
more
of
the
red
cheques
were
mine
i
suffered
all
four
pieces
now
worth
twenty
dollars
to
lie
i
had
not
come
there
to
amuse
myself
my
purpose
was
very
different
and
impelled
by
that
purpose
i
was
resolved
not
to
waste
time
if
fortune
was
to
prove
favourable
to
me
her
favours
were
as
likely
to
be
mine
soon
as
late
and
when
i
thought
of
the
real
stake
for
which
i
was
playing
i
could
not
endure
the
suspense
no
more
was
i
satisfied
at
contact
with
the
coarse
and
bawd
company
that
surrounded
the
table
the
deal
went
on
and
after
some
time
aces
again
came
out
this
time
i
lost
without
a
word
passing
from
his
lips
the
croupier
drew
in
the
cheques
and
depositing
them
in
his
japanned
i
took
out
my
purse
and
tried
ten
dollars
upon
the
queen
i
won
i
doubled
the
bet
and
lost
again
another
ten
dollars
won
another
lost
another
and
another
and
so
on
now
winning
now
losing
now
betting
with
cheques
now
with
until
at
length
i
felt
to
the
bottom
of
my
purse
without
encountering
a
coin
chapter
fifty
seven
the
watch
and
ring
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
turned
towards
with
a
glance
of
despair
i
needed
not
to
tell
him
the
result
my
look
would
have
announced
it
but
he
had
been
gazing
over
my
shoulder
and
knew
all
shall
we
go
monsieur
i
asked
not
yet
stay
a
moment
replied
he
placing
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
why
i
asked
i
have
not
a
dollar
i
have
lost
all
i
might
have
known
it
would
be
so
why
stay
here
sir
i
spoke
somewhat
brusquely
i
confess
i
was
at
the
moment
in
anything
but
an
amiable
mood
in
addition
to
my
prospects
for
the
morrow
a
suspicion
had
flashed
across
my
mind
that
my
new
friend
was
not
loyal
his
knowledge
of
these
men
his
having
counselled
me
to
play
there
the
accident
to
say
the
least
a
strange
one
of
our
again
meeting
with
the
sportsmen
of
the
boat
and
under
such
a
new
phase
the
great
celerity
with
which
my
purse
had
been
cleared
out
all
these
circumstances
passing
rapidly
through
my
mind
led
me
naturally
enough
to
suspect
of
treason
i
ran
rapidly
over
our
late
conversation
i
tried
to
remember
whether
he
had
said
or
done
anything
to
guide
me
into
this
particular
hell
certainly
he
had
not
proposed
my
playing
but
rather
opposed
it
and
i
could
not
remember
that
by
word
or
act
he
had
endeavoured
to
introduce
me
to
the
game
moreover
he
seemed
as
much
astonished
as
myself
at
seeing
these
gentlemen
behind
the
table
what
of
all
that
the
surprise
might
have
been
well
feigned
possibly
enough
and
after
my
late
experience
of
the
probably
enough
monsieur
was
also
a
partner
in
the
firm
of
chorley
hatcher
and
co
i
wheeled
round
with
an
angry
expression
on
my
lips
when
the
current
of
my
thoughts
was
suddenly
checked
and
turned
into
a
new
channel
the
young
creole
stood
looking
up
in
my
face
he
was
not
so
tall
as
i
gazing
upon
me
out
of
his
beautiful
eyes
and
waiting
until
my
moment
of
abstraction
should
pass
something
glittered
in
his
outstretched
hand
it
was
a
purse
i
could
see
the
yellow
coins
shining
through
the
silken
network
it
was
a
purse
of
gold
take
it
he
said
in
his
soft
silvery
voice
my
heart
fell
abashed
within
me
i
could
scarce
stammer
forth
a
reply
had
he
but
known
my
latest
thoughts
he
might
have
been
able
to
read
the
flush
of
shame
that
so
suddenly
mantled
my
cheeks
no
monsieur
i
replied
this
is
too
generous
of
you
i
can
not
accept
it
come
come
why
not
take
it
i
pray
try
fortune
again
she
has
frowned
on
you
of
late
but
remember
she
is
a
fickle
goddess
and
may
yet
smile
on
you
take
the
purse
man
indeed
monsieur
i
can
not
after
what
i
pardon
me
if
you
knew
then
must
play
for
you
remember
the
purpose
that
brought
us
here
remember
aurore
oh
this
ejaculation
wrung
from
my
heart
was
the
only
answer
i
could
make
before
the
young
creole
had
turned
to
the
and
was
placing
his
gold
upon
the
cards
i
stood
watching
him
with
feelings
of
astonishment
and
admiration
mingled
with
anxiety
for
the
result
what
small
white
hands
what
a
brilliant
jewel
sparkling
on
his
finger
a
diamond
it
has
caught
the
eyes
of
the
players
who
gloat
upon
it
as
it
passes
back
and
forward
to
the
cards
chorley
and
hatcher
have
both
noticed
it
i
saw
them
exchange
their
peculiar
glance
as
they
did
so
both
are
polite
to
him
by
the
large
bets
he
is
laying
he
has
won
their
esteem
their
attention
in
calling
out
the
card
when
he
wins
and
in
handing
him
his
cheques
is
marked
and
assiduous
he
is
the
favoured
better
of
the
ring
and
oh
how
the
eyes
of
those
fair
lemans
gleam
upon
him
with
their
wild
and
wicked
meaning
not
one
of
them
that
would
not
love
him
for
that
sparkling
gem
i
stood
on
one
side
watching
with
great
anxiety
greater
than
if
the
stake
had
been
my
own
but
it
my
own
it
was
the
generous
youth
was
playing
away
his
gold
for
my
suspense
was
not
likely
to
be
of
long
duration
he
was
losing
rapidly
recklessly
losing
he
had
taken
my
place
at
the
table
and
along
with
it
my
almost
every
bet
he
made
was
raked
into
the
bank
until
his
last
coin
lay
upon
the
cards
another
turn
and
that
too
chinked
as
it
fell
into
the
of
the
croupier
come
now
come
away
i
whispered
leaning
over
and
laying
hold
of
his
arm
how
much
against
this
he
asked
the
banker
without
heeding
me
how
much
sir
as
he
put
the
question
he
raised
the
gold
guard
over
his
head
at
the
same
time
drawing
forth
his
watch
i
suspected
this
was
his
intention
when
i
first
spoke
i
repeated
my
request
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
all
in
vain
he
pressed
chorley
for
a
reply
the
latter
was
not
the
man
to
waste
words
at
such
a
crisis
a
hundred
dollars
said
he
for
the
watch
fifty
more
upon
the
chain
beautiful
exclaimed
one
of
the
players
they
worth
more
muttered
another
even
in
the
hearts
around
that
table
there
were
human
feelings
there
is
always
a
touch
of
sympathy
for
him
who
loses
boldly
and
an
expression
of
this
in
favour
of
the
creole
youth
could
be
heard
from
time
to
time
as
his
money
parted
from
him
yes
that
watch
and
chain
are
worth
more
said
a
tall
man
who
sat
near
the
end
of
the
table
this
remark
was
made
in
a
firm
confident
tone
of
voice
that
seemed
to
command
chorley
attention
i
look
at
it
again
if
you
please
said
he
stretching
across
the
table
to
who
still
held
the
watch
in
his
hand
the
latter
surrendered
it
once
more
to
the
gambler
who
opened
the
case
and
commenced
inspecting
the
interior
it
was
an
elegant
watch
and
chain
also
of
the
fashion
usually
worn
by
ladies
they
were
worth
more
than
chorley
had
offered
though
that
did
not
appear
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
it
a
good
pile
o
money
is
a
hundred
an
fifty
dollars
drawled
he
a
good
biggish
pile
i
reckon
i
do
know
much
about
such
fixins
meself
but
it
full
valley
for
that
ar
watch
an
chain
i
shed
say
nonsense
cried
several
two
hundred
dollars
it
worth
it
all
see
the
jewels
chorley
cut
short
the
discussion
well
said
he
i
do
think
it
worth
more
than
what
i
bid
sir
but
since
you
wish
to
get
back
what
you
already
lost
i
do
mind
staking
two
hundred
against
watch
and
chain
together
does
that
satisfy
you
play
on
was
the
only
answer
made
by
the
impatient
creole
as
he
took
back
his
watch
and
laid
it
down
upon
one
of
the
cards
it
was
a
cheap
watch
to
chorley
it
cost
him
but
the
drawing
out
of
cards
and
it
became
his
how
much
against
this
drew
off
his
ring
and
held
it
before
the
dazzled
eyes
of
the
dealer
at
this
crisis
i
once
more
interfered
but
my
remonstrance
was
unheeded
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
stay
the
fiery
spirit
of
the
creole
the
ring
was
a
diamond
or
rather
a
collection
of
diamonds
in
a
gold
setting
it
like
the
watch
was
also
of
the
fashion
worn
by
ladies
and
i
could
hear
some
characteristic
remarks
muttered
around
the
table
such
as
that
young
blood
got
a
rich
girl
somewhere
there
more
where
they
come
from
and
the
like
the
ring
was
evidently
one
of
much
value
as
chorley
after
an
examination
of
it
proposed
to
stake
four
hundred
dollars
the
tall
man
in
dark
whiskers
again
interfered
and
put
it
at
five
hundred
the
circle
backed
him
and
the
dealer
at
length
agreed
to
give
that
sum
will
you
take
cheques
sir
he
inquired
addressing
or
do
you
mean
to
stake
it
at
one
bet
at
one
bet
was
the
answer
no
no
cried
several
voices
inclined
to
favour
at
one
bet
repeated
he
in
a
determined
tone
place
it
upon
the
ace
as
you
wish
sir
responded
chorley
with
perfect
at
the
same
time
handing
back
the
ring
to
its
owner
took
the
jewel
in
his
slender
white
fingers
and
laid
it
on
the
centre
of
the
card
it
was
the
only
bet
made
the
other
players
had
become
so
interested
in
the
result
that
they
withheld
their
stakes
in
order
to
watch
it
chorley
commenced
drawing
the
cards
each
one
as
it
came
forth
caused
a
momentary
thrill
of
expectancy
and
when
aces
deuces
or
tres
with
their
broad
white
margins
appeared
outside
the
edge
of
that
mysterious
box
the
excitement
became
intense
it
was
a
long
time
before
two
aces
came
together
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
importance
of
the
stakes
called
for
more
than
the
usual
time
to
decide
the
bet
it
was
decided
at
length
the
ring
followed
the
watch
i
caught
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
away
from
the
table
this
time
he
followed
me
unresistingly
as
he
had
nothing
more
to
lay
what
matters
it
said
he
with
a
gay
air
as
we
passed
together
out
of
the
saloon
ah
yes
he
continued
changing
his
tone
ah
yes
it
does
matter
it
matters
to
and
chapter
fifty
eight
my
forlorn
hope
it
was
pleasant
escaping
from
that
hot
hell
into
the
cool
night
air
into
the
soft
light
of
a
southern
moon
it
would
have
been
pleasant
under
other
circumstances
but
then
the
sweetest
clime
and
loveliest
scene
would
have
made
no
impression
upon
me
my
companion
seemed
to
share
my
bitterness
of
soul
his
words
of
consolation
were
not
without
their
influence
i
knew
they
were
the
expressions
of
a
real
sympathy
his
acts
had
already
proved
it
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
night
the
white
moon
rode
buoyantly
through
fleecy
clouds
that
thinly
dappled
the
azure
sky
of
louisiana
and
a
soft
breeze
played
through
the
now
silent
streets
a
lovely
night
too
sweet
and
balmy
my
spirit
would
have
preferred
a
storm
oh
for
black
clouds
red
lightning
and
thunder
rolling
and
crashing
through
the
sky
oh
for
the
whistling
wind
and
the
quick
pattering
of
the
oh
for
a
hurricane
without
consonant
to
the
storm
that
was
raging
within
me
it
was
but
a
few
steps
to
the
hotel
but
we
did
not
stop
there
we
could
think
better
in
the
open
air
and
converse
as
well
sleep
had
no
charms
for
me
and
my
companion
seemed
to
share
my
impulses
so
passing
once
more
from
among
the
houses
we
went
on
towards
the
swamp
caring
not
whither
we
went
we
walked
side
by
side
for
some
time
without
exchanging
speech
our
thoughts
were
running
upon
the
same
theme
the
business
of
no
longer
for
the
tolling
of
the
great
cathedral
clock
had
just
announced
the
hour
of
midnight
in
twelve
hours
more
the
de
would
commence
in
twelve
hours
more
they
would
be
bidding
for
my
betrothed
our
steps
were
towards
the
shell
road
and
soon
our
feet
crunched
upon
the
fragments
of
unios
and
bivalves
that
strewed
the
path
here
was
a
scene
more
in
unison
with
our
thoughts
above
and
around
waved
the
dark
solemn
fit
emblems
of
grief
rendered
doubly
lugubrious
in
their
expression
by
the
hoary
that
draped
them
like
a
couch
of
the
dead
the
sounds
too
that
here
saluted
our
ears
had
a
soothing
effect
the
melancholy
of
the
the
creaking
chirp
of
the
and
cicadas
the
solemn
of
the
the
hoarse
of
the
greater
batrachian
and
high
overhead
the
wild
treble
of
the
all
mingled
together
in
a
concert
that
however
disagreeable
under
other
circumstances
now
fell
upon
my
ears
like
music
and
even
imparted
a
kind
of
sad
pleasure
to
my
soul
and
yet
it
was
not
my
darkest
hour
a
darker
was
yet
in
store
for
me
despite
the
very
hopelessness
of
the
prospect
i
still
clung
to
hope
a
vague
feeling
it
was
but
it
sustained
me
against
despair
the
trunk
of
a
taxodium
lay
prostrate
by
the
side
of
our
path
upon
this
we
sat
down
we
had
exchanged
scarce
a
dozen
words
since
emerging
from
the
hell
i
was
busy
with
thoughts
of
the
morrow
my
young
companion
whom
i
now
regarded
in
the
light
of
an
old
and
tried
friend
was
thinking
of
the
same
what
generosity
towards
a
stranger
what
little
did
i
then
know
of
the
vast
noble
grandeur
of
that
there
now
remains
but
one
chance
i
said
the
chance
that
mail
or
rather
may
bring
my
letter
it
might
still
arrive
in
time
the
mail
is
due
by
ten
in
the
morning
true
replied
my
companion
seemingly
too
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
to
give
much
heed
to
what
i
had
said
if
not
i
continued
then
there
is
only
the
hope
that
he
who
shall
become
the
purchaser
may
afterwards
sell
her
to
i
care
not
at
what
price
if
i
ah
interrupted
suddenly
waking
from
his
reverie
it
is
just
that
which
troubles
me
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
thinking
upon
i
fear
monsieur
i
fear
speak
on
i
fear
there
is
no
hope
that
he
who
buys
her
will
be
willing
to
sell
her
again
and
why
will
not
a
large
sum
no
no
i
fear
that
he
who
buys
will
not
give
her
up
again
any
ha
why
do
you
think
so
monsieur
i
have
my
suspicion
that
a
certain
individual
designs
who
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
oh
heavens
gayarre
gayarre
yes
from
what
you
have
told
me
from
what
i
know
myself
for
i
too
have
some
knowledge
of
dominique
gayarre
gayarre
gayarre
oh
god
i
could
only
ejaculate
the
announcement
had
almost
deprived
me
of
the
power
of
speech
a
sensation
of
numbness
seemed
to
creep
over
me
a
prostration
of
spirit
as
if
some
horrid
danger
was
impending
and
nigh
and
i
without
the
power
to
avert
it
strange
this
thought
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
i
had
supposed
that
the
quadroon
would
be
sold
to
some
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
some
one
who
would
be
disposed
to
at
a
profit
perhaps
an
enormous
one
but
in
time
i
should
be
prepared
for
that
strange
i
had
never
thought
of
gayarre
becoming
the
purchaser
but
indeed
since
the
hour
when
i
first
heard
of
the
bankruptcy
my
thoughts
had
been
running
too
wildly
to
permit
me
to
reflect
calmly
upon
anything
now
it
was
clear
it
was
no
longer
a
conjecture
most
certainly
gayarre
would
become
the
master
of
aurore
ere
another
night
her
body
would
be
his
property
her
soul
oh
god
am
i
awake
do
i
dream
i
had
a
suspicion
of
this
before
continued
for
i
may
tell
you
i
know
something
of
this
family
history
of
eugenie
besancon
of
aurore
of
gayarre
the
avocat
i
had
a
suspicion
before
that
gayarre
might
desire
to
be
the
owner
of
aurore
but
now
that
you
have
told
me
of
the
scene
in
the
i
no
longer
doubt
this
design
oh
it
is
infamous
still
further
proof
of
it
continued
there
was
a
man
on
the
boat
you
did
not
notice
him
perhaps
an
agent
for
gayarre
in
such
matters
a
a
fit
tool
for
such
a
purpose
no
doubt
his
object
in
coming
down
to
the
city
is
to
be
present
at
the
sale
to
bid
for
the
poor
girl
but
why
i
asked
catching
at
a
straw
of
hope
why
since
he
wishes
to
possess
aurore
could
he
not
have
effected
it
by
private
contract
why
send
her
to
the
to
public
auction
the
law
requires
it
the
slaves
of
an
estate
in
bankruptcy
must
be
sold
publicly
to
the
highest
bidder
besides
monsieur
bad
as
may
be
this
man
he
dare
not
for
the
sake
of
his
character
act
as
you
have
suggested
he
is
a
thorough
hypocrite
and
with
all
his
wickedness
wishes
to
stand
well
before
the
world
there
are
many
who
believe
gayarre
a
good
man
he
dare
not
act
openly
in
this
villainous
design
and
will
not
appear
in
it
to
save
scandal
the
will
be
supposed
to
purchase
for
himself
it
is
infamous
beyond
conception
oh
what
is
to
be
done
to
save
her
from
this
fearful
man
to
save
me
it
is
of
that
i
am
thinking
and
have
been
for
the
last
hour
be
of
good
cheer
monsieur
all
hope
is
not
lost
there
is
still
one
chance
of
saving
aurore
there
is
one
hope
left
alas
i
have
known
the
time
i
too
have
been
unfortunate
sadly
sadly
unfortunate
no
matter
now
we
shall
not
talk
of
my
sorrows
till
yours
have
been
relieved
perhaps
at
some
future
time
you
may
know
me
and
my
griefs
no
more
of
that
now
there
is
still
one
chance
for
aurore
and
she
and
you
both
may
yet
be
happy
it
must
be
so
i
am
resolved
upon
it
be
a
wild
act
but
it
is
a
wild
story
enough
i
have
no
time
to
spare
i
must
be
gone
now
to
your
hotel
go
and
rest
at
twelve
i
shall
be
with
you
at
twelve
in
the
rotundo
good
night
adieu
without
allowing
me
time
to
ask
for
an
explanation
or
make
any
reply
the
creole
parted
from
me
and
plunging
into
a
narrow
street
soon
passed
out
of
sight
pondering
over
his
incoherent
words
over
his
unintelligible
promise
upon
his
strange
looks
and
manner
i
walked
slowly
to
my
hotel
without
undressing
i
flung
myself
on
my
bed
without
a
thought
of
going
to
sleep
chapter
fifty
nine
the
rotundo
the
thousand
and
one
reflections
of
a
sleepless
night
the
thousand
and
one
alternations
of
hope
and
doubt
and
fear
the
theoretic
tentation
of
a
hundred
projects
all
passed
before
my
waking
spirit
yet
when
morning
came
and
the
yellow
sunlight
fell
painfully
on
my
eyes
i
had
advanced
no
farther
in
any
plan
of
proceeding
all
my
hopes
centred
upon
for
i
no
longer
dwelt
upon
the
chances
of
the
mail
to
be
assured
upon
this
head
however
as
soon
as
it
had
arrived
i
once
more
sought
the
of
brown
and
co
the
negative
answer
to
my
inquiry
was
no
longer
a
disappointment
i
had
anticipated
it
when
did
money
ever
arrive
in
time
for
a
crisis

the

course
of

yet
those

affairs

some
cause

sending
it
so
swore
i
as
i
parted
from
the

and
co
it
was
twelve
when
i
returned
to
the
rue
saint
louis
i
did
not
the
hotel
i
walked
direct
to
the
my
pen
fails
to
paint
the
dark
emotions
of
my
soul
as
i
stepped
under
the
shadow
of
that
spacious
dome
i
remember
no
fooling
akin
to
what
i
experienced
at
that
moment
i
have
stood
under
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
grand
cathedral
and
felt
the
solemnity
of
religious
awe
i
have
passed
through
the
gilded
saloons
of
a
regal
palace
that
inspired
me
with
pity
and
contempt
pity
for
the
slaves
who
had
sweated
for
that
gilding
and
contempt
for
the
sycophants
who
surrounded
me
i
have
inspected
the
sombre
cells
of
a
prison
with
feelings
of
pain
but
remembered
no
scene
that
had
so
painfully
impressed
me
as
that
which
now
presented
itself
before
my
eyes
not
sacred
was
that
spot
on
the
contrary
i
stood
upon
ground
desecrated
by
acts
of
the
deepest
infamy
this
was
the
famed
of
new
the
place
where
human
bodies
i
might
almost
say
were
bought
and
sold
many
a
forced
and
painful
parting
had
these
walls
witnessed
oft
had
the
husband
been
here
severed
from
his
wife
the
mother
from
her
child
oft
had
the
bitter
that
marble
pavement
oft
had
that
vaulted
dome
echoed
back
the
sigh
nay
more
the
cry
of
the
anguished
heart
i
repeat
it
my
soul
was
filled
with
dark
emotions
as
i
entered
within
the
precincts
of
that
spacious
hall
and
no
wonder
with
such
thoughts
in
my
heart
and
such
a
scene
before
my
eyes
as
i
then
looked
upon
you
will
expect
a
description
of
that
scene
i
must
disappoint
you
i
can
not
give
one
had
i
been
there
as
an
ordinary
spectator
a
reporter
cool
and
unmoved
by
what
was
passing
i
might
have
noted
the
details
and
set
them
before
you
but
the
case
was
far
otherwise
one
thought
alone
was
in
my
mind
my
eyes
sought
for
one
sole
object
and
that
prevented
me
from
observing
the
varied
features
of
the
spectacle
a
few
things
i
do
remember
i
remember
that
the
rotundo
as
its
name
imports
was
a
circular
hall
of
large
extent
with
a
flagged
floor
an
arched
coiling
and
white
walls
these
were
without
windows
for
the
hall
was
lighted
from
above
on
one
side
near
the
wall
stood
a
desk
or
rostrum
upon
an
elevated
dais
and
by
the
side
of
this
a
large
block
of
cut
stone
of
the
form
of
a
parallelopipedon
the
use
of
these
two
objects
i
divined
a
stone
kerb
or
banquette
ran
around
one
portion
of
the
wall
the
purpose
of
this
was
equally
apparent
the
hall
when
i
entered
was
half
filled
with
people
they
appeared
to
be
of
all
ages
and
sorts
they
stood
conversing
in
groups
just
as
men
do
when
assembled
for
any
business
ceremony
or
amusement
and
waiting
for
the
affair
to
begin
it
was
plain
however
from
the
demeanour
of
these
people
that
what
they
waited
for
did
not
impress
them
with
any
feelings
of
solemnity
on
the
contrary
a
might
have
been
anticipated
judging
from
the
rough
jests
and
coarse
peals
of
laughter
that
from
time
to
time
rang
through
the
hall
there
was
one
group
however
which
gave
out
no
such
signs
or
sounds
seated
along
the
stone
banquette
and
standing
beside
it
squatted
down
upon
the
floor
or
leaning
against
the
wall
in
any
and
every
attitude
were
the
individuals
of
this
group
their
black
and
brown
skins
the
woolly
covering
of
their
skulls
their
rough
red
brogans
their
coarse
garments
of
cheap
cottonade
of
jeans
of
nigger
cloth
died
cinnamon
colour
by
the
juice
of
the
these
characteristics
marked
them
as
distinct
from
all
the
other
groups
in
the
hall
a
distinct
race
of
beings
but
even
without
the
distinctions
of
dress
or
complexion
even
without
the
thick
lips
or
high
cheekbones
and
woolly
hair
it
was
easy
to
tell
that
those
who
sat
upon
the
banquette
were
under
different
circumstances
from
these
who
strutted
over
the
floor
while
these
talked
loudly
and
laughed
gaily
those
were
silent
and
sad
these
moved
about
with
the
air
of
the
conqueror
those
were
motionless
with
the
passive
look
and
downcast
mien
of
the
captive
these
were
those
were
they
were
the
slaves
of
the
plantation
besancon
all
were
silent
or
spoke
only
in
whispers
most
of
them
seemed
ill
at
ease
mothers
sat
holding
their
piccaninnies
in
their
sable
embrace
murmuring
expressions
of
endearment
or
endeavouring
to
hush
them
to
rest
here
and
there
big
tears
rolled
over
their
swarthy
cheeks
as
the
maternal
heart
rose
and
fell
with
swelling
emotions
fathers
looked
on
with
drier
eyes
but
with
the
stern
helpless
gaze
of
despair
which
bespoke
the
consciousness
that
they
had
no
power
to
avert
their
fate
no
power
to
undo
whatever
might
be
decreed
by
the
pitiless
wretches
around
them
not
all
of
them
wore
this
expression
several
of
the
younger
slaves
both
boys
and
girls
were
in
stuffs
of
brilliant
colours
with
flounces
frills
and
ribbons
most
of
these
appeared
indifferent
to
their
future
some
even
seemed
happy
laughing
and
chatting
gaily
to
each
other
or
occasionally
exchanging
a
light
word
with
one
of
the
white
folks
a
change
of
masters
could
not
be
such
a
terrible
idea
after
the
usage
they
had
lately
had
some
of
them
rather
anticipated
such
an
event
with
hopeful
pleasure
these
were
the
dandy
young
men
and
the
yellow
belles
of
the
plantation
they
would
perhaps
be
allowed
to
remain
in
that
great
city
of
which
they
had
so
often
heard
perhaps
a
brighter
future
was
before
them
dark
must
it
be
to
be
darker
than
their
proximate
past
i
glanced
over
the
different
groups
but
my
eyes
rested
not
long
upon
them
a
glance
was
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
was
not
there
there
was
no
danger
of
mistaking
any
one
of
those
forms
or
faces
for
that
of
aurore
she
was
not
there
thank
heaven
i
was
spared
the
humiliation
of
seeing
her
in
such
a
crowd
she
was
no
doubt
near
at
hand
and
would
be
brought
in
when
her
turn
came
i
could
ill
brook
the
thought
of
seeing
her
exposed
to
the
rude
and
insulting
glances
perhaps
insulting
speeches
of
which
she
might
be
the
object
and
yet
that
ordeal
was
in
store
for
me
i
did
not
discover
myself
to
the
slaves
i
knew
their
impulsive
natures
and
that
a
scene
would
be
the
result
i
should
be
the
recipient
of
their
salutations
and
entreaties
uttered
loud
enough
to
draw
the
attention
of
all
upon
me
to
avoid
this
i
took
my
station
behind
one
of
the
groups
of
white
men
that
screened
me
from
their
notice
and
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
entrance
watching
for
in
him
now
lay
my
last
and
only
hope
i
could
not
help
noting
the
individuals
who
passed
out
and
in
of
course
they
were
all
of
my
own
sex
but
of
every
variety
there
was
the
regular
a
tall
lathy
fellow
with
harsh
features
careless
dress
loose
coat
slouching
hat
coarse
boots
and
painted
quirt
of
raw
hide
the
cowskin
fit
emblem
of
his
calling
in
strong
contrast
to
him
was
the
creole
in
coat
of
claret
or
blue
with
gold
buttons
plated
pantaloons
gaiter
bootees
laced
shirt
and
diamond
studs
an

variety
of
the

might
be
seen

of
buff

the

and

but
gaily

the

the
rich
planter
of
the
coast
the
proprietor
of
the
cotton
press
or
pickery
with
a
sprinkling
of
nondescripts
made
up
the
crowd
that
had
now
assembled
in
the
rotundo
as
i
stood
noting
these
various
forms
and
costumes
a
large
man
with
florid
face
and
dressed
in
a
green
coat
passed
through
the
entrance
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
bundle
of
papers
and
in
the
other
a
small
mallet
with
ivory
head
that
at
once
proclaimed
his
calling
his
entrance
produced
a
buzz
and
set
the
various
groups
in
motion
i
could
hear
the
phrases
here
he
comes
yon
him
here
comes
the
major
this
was
not
needed
to
proclaim
to
all
present
who
was
the
individual
in
the
green
the
beautiful
dome
of
saint
charles
itself
was
not
better
known
to
the
citizens
of
new
orleans
than
was
major
b
the
celebrated
auctioneer
in
another
minute
the
bright
bland
face
of
the
major
appeared
above
the
rostrum
a
few
smart
raps
of
his
hammer
commanded
silence
and
the
sale
began
scipio
was
ordered
first
upon
the
block
the
crowd
of
intended
bidders
pressed
around
him
poked
their
fingers
between
his
ribs
felt
his
limbs
as
if
he
had
been
a
fat
ox
opened
his
mouth
and
examined
his
teeth
as
if
he
had
been
a
horse
and
then
bid
for
him
just
like
he
had
been
one
or
the
other
under
other
circumstances
i
could
have
felt
compassion
for
the
poor
fellow
but
my
heart
was
too
full
there
was
no
room
in
it
for
scipio
and
i
averted
my
face
from
the
disgusting
spectacle
chapter
sixty
the
i
once
more
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
entrance
scrutinising
every
form
that
passed
in
as
yet
no
appearance
of
surely
he
would
soon
arrive
he
said
at
twelve
it
was
now
one
and
still
he
had
not
come
no
doubt
he
would
come
and
in
proper
time
after
all
i
need
not
be
so
anxious
as
to
the
time
her
name
was
last
upon
the
list
it
would
be
a
long
time
i
had
full
reliance
upon
my
new
friend
almost
unknown
but
not
untried
his
conduct
on
the
previous
night
had
inspired
me
with
perfect
confidence
he
would
not
disappoint
me
his
being
thus
late
did
not
shake
my
faith
in
him
there
was
some
difficulty
about
his
obtaining
the
money
for
it
was
i
expected
him
to
bring
he
had
hinted
as
much
no
doubt
it
was
that
that
was
detaining
him
but
he
would
be
in
time
he
knew
that
her
name
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
the
last
lot
lot
notwithstanding
my
confidence
in
i
was
it
was
very
natural
i
should
be
so
and
requires
no
explanation
i
kept
my
gaze
upon
the
door
hoping
moment
to
see
him
enter
behind
me
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
in
constant
and
monotonous
repetition
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
smart
rap
of
his
ivory
mallet
i
knew
that
the
sale
was
going
on
and
by
the
frequent
strokes
of
the
hammer
i
could
tell
that
it
was
rapidly
progressing
although
but
some
of
the
slaves
had
yet
been
disposed
of
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
they
were
galloping
down
the
list
and
that
turn
would
soon
come
too
soon
with
the
fancy
my
heart
beat
quicker
and
wilder
surely
will
not
disappoint
me
a
group
stood
near
me
talking
gaily
they
were
all
young
men
and
fashionably
dressed
the
scions
i
could
tell
of
the
creole
noblesse
they
conversed
in
a
tone
sufficiently
loud
for
me
to
overhear
them
perhaps
i
should
not
have
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
had
not
one
of
them
mentioned
a
particular
name
that
fell
harshly
upon
my
ear
the
name
was
i
had
an
unpleasant
recollection
associated
with
this
name
it
was
a
marigny
of
whom
scipio
had
spoken
to
me
a
marigny
who
had
proposed
to
of
course
i
remembered
the
name
marigny
i
listened
so

to
bid

one
replied
a
young
sprig
stylishly
and
somewhat
foppishly
dressed
oui
he
continued
with
a
languid
drawl
as
he
drew
tighter
his
lavender
gloves
and
twirled
his
tiny
cane

yes
how
high
will

eugenie
ay
where
is
she
monsieur
asked
another
of
the
party
very
strange
said
several
at
once
where
can
she
be
le
ber
you
must
know
i
know
nothing
of
the
movements
of
mademoiselle
besancon
answered
the
young
man
with
an
air
of
chagrin
and
surprise
too
as
if
he
was
really
ignorant
upon
the
subject
as
well
as
vexed
by
the
remarks
which
his
companions
were
making
there
something
mysterious
in
all
this
continued
one
of
the
number
i
should
be
astonished
at
it
if
it
were
any
one
else
than
eugenie
besancon
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
conversation
interested
me
every
word
of
it
fell
like
a
spark
of
fire
upon
my
heart
and
i
could
have
strangled
these
fellows
one
and
all
of
them
as
they
stood
little
knew
they
that
the
young
englishman
was
near
listening
to
them
and
as
little
the
dire
effect
their
words
were
producing
it
was
not
what
they
said
of
eugenie
that
gave
me
pain
it
was
their
free
speech
about
aurore
i
have
not
repeated
their
ribald
talk
in
relation
to
her
their
jesting
innuendoes
their
base
hypotheses
and
coldly
brutal
sneers
whenever
her
chastity
was
named
one
in
particular
a
certain
monsieur
sevigne
was
more
than
any
of
his
companions
and
once
or
twice
i
was
upon
the
point
of
turning
upon
him
it
cost
me
an
effort
to
restrain
myself
but
that
effort
was
successful
and
i
stood
unmoved
perhaps
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
endure
it
much
longer
but
for
the
interposition
of
an
event
which
at
once
drove
these
gossips
and
their
idle
talk
out
of
my
mind
that
event
was
entrance
of
they
had
again
commenced
speaking
of
her
of
her
chastity
of
her
rare
charms
they
were
dismissing
the
probabilities
as
to
who
would
become
possessed
of
her
and
the
that
she
would
be
the
of
whoever
did
they
were
waxing
warmer
in
their
eulogium
of
her
beauty
and
beginning
to
lay
wagers
on
the
result
of
the
sale
when
all
at
once
the
clack
of
their
conversation
ceased
and
two
or
three
cried
out
voila
elle
i
turned
mechanically
at
the
words
aurore
was
in
the
entrance
chapter
sixty
one
bidding
for
my
betrothed
yes
aurore
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
that
infernal
hall
and
stood
timidly
pausing
upon
its
threshold
she
was
not
alone
a
mulatto
girl
was
by
her
side
like
herself
a
slave
like
herself
brought
there
be
a
third
individual
was
of
the
party
or
rather
with
it
for
he
did
not
walk
by
the
side
of
the
girls
but
in
front
evidently
conducting
them
to
the
place
of
sale
this
individual
was
no
other
than
larkin
the
brutal
overseer
come
along
said
he
roughly
at
the
same
time
beckoning
to
aurore
and
her
companion
this
way
gals
foller
me
they
obeyed
his
rude
signal
and
passing
in
followed
him
across
the
hall
towards
the
rostrum
i
stood
with
slouched
hat
and
averted
face
aurore
saw
me
not
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
past
and
their
backs
towards
me
my
eyes
followed
them
oh
beautiful
aurore
beautiful
as
ever
i
was
not
single
in
my
admiration
the
appearance
of
the
quadroon
created
a
sensation
the
din
ceased
as
if
by
a
signal
every
voice
became
hushed
and
every
eye
was
bent
upon
her
as
she
moved
across
the
floor
men
hurried
forward
from
distant
parts
of
the
hall
to
get
a
nearer
glance
others
made
way
for
her
stepping
politely
back
as
if
she
had
been
a
queen
men
did
this
who
would
have
scorned
to
offer
politeness
to
another
of
her
race
to
the
yellow
girl
for
instance
who
walked
by
her
side
oh
the
power
of
beauty
never
was
it
more
markedly
shown
than
in
the
of
that
poor
slave
i
heard
the
whispers
i
observed
the
glances
of
admiration
of
passion
i
marked
the
longing
eyes
that
followed
her
noting
her
splendid
form
and
its
undulating
outlines
as
she
moved
forward
all
this
gave
me
pain
it
was
a
feeling
worse
than
mere
jealousy
i
experienced
it
was
jealousy
embittered
by
the
very
brutality
of
my
rivals
aurore
was
simply
attired
there
was
no
affectation
of
the
fine
lady
none
of
the
ribbons
and
flounces
that
bedecked
the
dresses
of
her
companion
such
would
have
ill
assorted
with
the
noble
melancholy
that
appeared
upon
her
beautiful
countenance
none
of
all
this
a
robe
of
muslin
tastefully
made
with
long
skirt
and
tight
sleeves
as
was
the
fashion
of
the
time
a
fashion
that
displayed
the
pleasing
rotundity
of
her
figure
her
was
that
worn
by
all
quadroons
the
toque
of
the
madras
kerchief
which
sat
upon
her
brow
like
a
coronet
its
green
crimson
and
yellow
checks
contrasting
finely
with
the
raven
blackness
of
her
hair
she
wore
no
ornaments
excepting
the
broad
gold
rings
that
glittered
against
the
rich
glow
of
her
cheeks
and
upon
her
finger
one
other
circlet
of
gold
the
token
of
her
betrothal
i
knew
it
well
i
buried
myself
in
the
crowd
slouching
my
hat
on
that
side
towards
the
rostrum
i
desired
she
should
not
see
me
while
i
could
not
help
gazing
upon
her
i
had
taken
my
stand
in
such
a
situation
that
i
could
still
command
a
view
of
the
entrance
more
than
ever
was
i
anxious
about
the
coming
of
aurore
had
been
placed
near
the
foot
of
the
rostrum
i
could
just
see
the
edge
of
her
turban
over
the
shoulders
of
the
crowd
by
elevating
myself
on
my
toes
i
could
observe
her
face
which
by
chance
was
turned
towards
me
oh
how
my
heart
heaved
as
i
struggled
to
read
its
expression
as
i
endeavoured
to
divine
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
she
looked
sad
and
anxious
that
was
natural
enough
but
i
looked
for
another
expression
that
unquiet
anxiety
produced
by
the
alternation
of
hope
and
fear
her
eye
wandered
over
the
crowd
she
scanned
the
sea
of
faces
that
surrounded
her
was
searching
for
some
one
was
it
for
i
held
down
my
face
as
her
glance
passed
over
the
spot
i
dared
not
meet
her
gaze
i
feared
that
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
addressing
her
sweet
aurore
i
again
looked
up
her
eye
was
still
wandering
in
fruitless
search
oh
surely
it
is
for
me
again
i
cowered
behind
the
crowd
and
her
glance
was
carried
onward
i
raised
myself
once
more
i
saw
the
shadow
darkening
upon
her
face
her
eye
filled
with
a
deeper
expression
it
was
the
look
of
despair
courage
courage
i
whispered
to
myself
look
again
lovely
aurore
this
time
i
shall
meet
you
i
shall
speak
to
you
from
mine
eyes
i
shall
give
back
glance
for
glance
she
sees
she
recognises
me
that
start
the
flash
of
joy
in
her
eyes
the
smile
curling
upon
her
lips
her
glance
wanders
no
more
her
gaze
is
fixed
proud
heart
it
for
me
yes
our
eyes
met
at
length
met
melting
and
swimming
with
love
mine
had
escaped
from
my
control
for
some
moments
i
could
not
turn
them
aside
but
surrendered
them
to
the
impulse
of
my
passion
it
was
mutual
i
doubted
it
not
i
felt
as
though
the
ray
of
was
passing
between
us
i
had
almost
forgotten
where
i
stood
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
and
a
movement
restored
me
to
my
senses
her
stedfast
gaze
had
been
noticed
and
by
many
skilled
to
interpret
such
glances
had
been
understood
these
in
turning
round
to
see
who
was
the
object
of
that
glance
had
caused
the
movement
i
had
observed
it
in
time
and
turned
my
face
in
another
direction
i
watched
the
entrance
for
why
had
he
not
arrived
my
anxiety
increased
with
the
minutes
true
it
would
still
be
an
hour
perhaps
two
before
her
time
should
ha
what
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
something
of
interest
was
going
on
i
looked
towards
the
rostrum
for
an
explanation
a
dark
man
had
climbed
upon
one
of
the
steps
and
was
whispering
to
the
auctioneer
he
remained
but
a
moment
he
appeared
to
have
asked
some
favour
which
was
at
once
conceded
him
and
he
stepped
back
to
his
place
among
the
crowd
a
minute
or
two
intervened
and
then
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
i
saw
the
overseer
take
aurore
by
the
arm
and
raise
her
upon
the
block
the
intention
was
plain
was
to
be
sold
in
the
moments
that
followed
i
can
not
remember
exactly
how
i
acted
i
ran
wildly
for
the
entrance
i
looked
out
into
the
street
up
and
down
i
glanced
with
anxious
eyes
no
i
rushed
back
into
the
hall
again
through
the
outer
circles
of
the
crowd
in
the
direction
of
the
rostrum
the
bidding
had
begun
i
had
not
heard
the
preliminaries
but
as
i
there
fell
upon
my
ears
the
terrible
words
thousand
dollars
for
the
thousand
dollars
o
heaven
has
deceived
me
she
is
lost
lost
in
my
desperation
i
was
about
to
interrupt
the
sale
i
was
about
to
proclaim
aloud
its
unfairness
in
the
fact
that
the
quadroon
had
been
out
of
the
order
even
on
this
poor
plea
i
rested
a
hope
it
was
the
straw
to
the
drowning
man
but
i
was
determined
to
grasp
it
i
had
opened
my
lips
to
call
out
when
some
one
pulling
me
by
the
sleeve
caused
me
to
turn
round
it
was
thank
heaven
it
was
i
could
scarce
restrain
myself
from
shouting
with
joy
his
look
told
me
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
bright
gold
in
time
and
none
to
spare
whispered
he
thrusting
a
between
my
fingers
there
is
three
thousand
dollars
that
will
surely
be
enough
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
procure
i
can
not
stay
here
there
are
those
i
do
not
wish
to
see
i
shall
meet
you
after
the
sale
is
over
adieu
i
scarce
thanked
him
i
saw
not
his
parting
my
eyes
were
elsewhere
fifteen
hundred

good
housekeeper
sempstress
fifteen
hundred
dollars
i
called
out
my
voice
husky
with
emotion
the
sudden
leap
over
such
a
large
sum
drew
the
attention
of
the
crowd
upon
me
looks
smiles
and
innuendoes
were
freely
exchanged
at
my
expense
i
saw
or
rather
heeded
them
not
i
saw
aurore
only
aurore
standing
upon
the
dais
like
a
statue
upon
its
pedestal
the
type
of
sadness
and
beauty
the
sooner
i
could
take
her
thence
the
happier
for
me
and
with
that
object
in
view
i
had
made
my
bid

i
again
cried
out
in
as
firm
a
voice
as
i
could
command
hundred
dollars
repeated
the
auctioneer
in
his
monotonous
drawl
six
you
sir
thank
you

oh
god

nodded
the
tall
dark
man
who
had
whispered
to
the
auctioneer
hundred

two
thousand
nine
hundred
three

i
gasped
out
in
despair
it
was
my
last
bid
i
could
go
no
farther
i
waited
for
the
result
as
the
condemned
waits
for
the
falling
of
the
trap
or
the
descent
of
the
axe
my
heart
could
not
have
endured
very
long
that
terrible
suspense
but
i
had
not
long
to
endure
it
thousand
one
hundred
three
thousand
one
hundred
bid
hundred
dollars
i
cast
one
look
upon
aurore
it
was
a
look
of
hopeless
despair
and
turning
away
i
staggered
mechanically
across
the
hall
before
i
had
reached
the
entrance
i
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
in
the
same
prolonged
drawl
calling
out
three
thousand
five
hundred
bid
for
the
quadroon
girl
i
halted
and
listened
the
sale
was
coming
to
its
close
three
thousand
five
hundred
going
at
three
thousand
five
hundred
going
going
the
sharp
stroke
of
the
hammer
fell
upon
my
ear
it
drowned
the
final
word
gone
but
my
heart
pronounced
that
word
in
the
emphasis
of
its
agony
there
was
a
noisy
scene
of
confusion
loud
words
and
high
excitement
among
the
crowd
of
disappointed
bidders
who
was
the
fortunate
one
i
leant
over
to
ascertain
the
tall
dark
man
was
in
conversation
with
the
auctioneer
aurore
stood
beside
him
i
now
remembered
having
seen
the
man
on
the
boat
he
was
the
agent
of
whom
had
spoken
the
creole
had
guessed
aright
and
so
too
had
le
ber
had
outbid
them
chapter
sixty
two
the
for
a
while
i
lingered
in
the
hall
irresolute
and
almost
without
purpose
she
whom
i
loved
and
who
loved
me
in
return
was
wrested
from
me
by
an
infamous
law
ruthlessly
torn
from
me
she
would
be
borne
away
before
my
eyes
and
i
might
perhaps
never
behold
her
again
probable
enough
was
this
thought
i
might
never
behold
her
again
lost
to
me
more
hopelessly
lost
than
if
she
had
become
the
of
another
far
more
hopelessly
lost
then
at
least
she
would
have
been
free
to
think
to
act
to
go
abroad
to
then
i
might
have
hoped
to
meet
her
again
to
see
her
to
gaze
upon
her
even
if
only
at
a
distance
to
worship
her
in
the
secret
silence
of
my
heart
to
console
myself
with
the
belief
that
she
still
loved
me
yes
the
bride
the
wife
of
another
even
that
i
could
have
borne
with
calmness
but
now
not
the
bride
of
another
but
the
the
forced
unwilling
and
that
other
oh
how
my
heart
writhed
under
its
horrible
imaginings
what
next
how
was
i
to
act
resign
myself
to
the
situation
make
no
further
effort
to
recover
to
save
her
no
it
had
not
come
to
that
discouraging
as
the
prospect
was
a
ray
of
hope
was
visible
one
ray
yet
illumed
the
dark
future
sustaining
and
bracing
my
mind
for
further
action
the
plan
was
still
undefined
but
the
purpose
had
been
formed
and
that
purpose
was
to
free
aurore
to
make
her
mine
every
i
thought
no
longer
of
buying
her
i
knew
that
gayarre
had
become
her
owner
i
felt
satisfied
that
to
purchase
her
was
no
longer
possible
he
who
had
paid
such
an
enormous
sum
would
not
be
likely
to
part
with
her
at
any
price
my
whole
fortune
would
not
suffice
i
gave
not
a
thought
to
it
i
felt
certain
it
would
be
impossible
far
different
was
the
resolve
that
was
already
forming
itself
in
my
mind
and
cheering
me
with
new
hopes
forming
itself
do
i
say
it
had
already
taken
a
definite
shape
even
before
the
echoes
of
the
voice
had
died
upon
my
ears
with
the
clink
of
his
hammer
my
mind
was
made
up
the
purpose
was
formed
it
was
only
the
that
remained
indefinite
i
had
resolved
to
outrage
the
laws
to
become
thief
or
robber
whichever
it
might
please
circumstances
to
make
me
i
had
resolved
to
my
disgrace
there
might
be
danger
i
knew
there
was
not
only
to
my
liberty
but
my
life
i
cared
but
little
about
the
disgrace
i
recked
not
of
the
danger
my
purpose
was
fixed
my
determination
taken
brief
had
been
the
mental
process
that
conducted
me
to
this
determination
the
more
brief
that
the
thought
had
passed
through
my
mind
before
the
more
brief
that
i
believed
there
was
positively
no
other
means
i
could
adopt
it
was
the
only
course
of
action
left
me
either
that
or
yield
up
all
that
i
loved
without
a
struggle
and
as
i
was
i
was
not
going
to
yield
certain
disgrace
even
death
itself
appeared
more
welcome
than
this
alternative
i
had
formed
not
yet
the
shadow
of
a
plan
that
must
be
thought
of
afterwards
but
even
at
that
moment
was
action
required
my
poor
heart
was
on
the
rack
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
a
single
night
should
pass
and
she
under
the
same
roof
with
that
hideous
man
wherever
she
should
pass
the
night
i
was
determined
that
i
should
not
be
from
her
walls
might
separate
us
but
she
should
know
i
was
near
just
that
much
of
a
plan
i
thought
of
stepping
to
a
retired
spot
i
took
out
my
and
wrote
upon
one
of
its
leaves
soir
edouard
i
had
no
time
to
be
more
particular
for
i
feared
every
moment
she
would
be
hurried
out
of
my
sight
i
tore
out
the
leaf
and
hastily
folding
it
returned
to
the
entrance
of
the
rotundo
just
as
i
got
back
to
the
door
a
drove
up
and
halted
in
front
i
conjectured
its
use
and
lost
no
time
in
providing
another
from
a
stand
close
by
this
done
i
returned
within
the
hall
i
was
yet
in
time
as
i
entered
i
saw
aurore
being
led
away
from
the
rostrum
i
pressed
into
the
crowd
and
stood
in
such
a
position
that
she
would
have
to
pass
near
me
and
she
did
so
our
hands
met
and
the
note
parted
from
my
fingers
there
was
no
time
for
a
further
recognition
not
even
a
for
the
moment
after
she
was
hurried
on
through
the
crowd
and
the
closed
after
her
the
mulatto
girl
accompanied
her
and
another
of
the
female
slaves
all
were
put
into
the
carriage
the
climbed
to
the
box
alongside
the
coachman
and
the
vehicle
rattled
off
over
the
stony
pavement
a
word
to
my
driver
was
enough
who
giving
the
whip
to
his
horses
followed
at
like
speed

confidants
of

a
a
hundred
yards
in
front
rolled
the
carriage
that
had
taken
aurore
now
turning
round
corners
now
passing
among
drays
laden
with
huge
or
hogsheads
of
sugar
but
my
driver
had
fixed
his
knowing
eye
upon
it
and
i
had
no
need
to
be
uneasy
it
passed
up
the
rue
chartres
but
a
short
distance
and
then
turned
into
one
of
the
short
streets
that
ran
from
this
at
right
angles
towards
the
levee
i
fancied
for
a
moment
it
was
making
for
the
steamboat
wharves
but
on
reaching
the
corner
i
saw
that
it
had
stopped
about
half
way
down
the
street
my
driver
according
to
the
instructions
i
had
given
him
pulled
up
at
the
corner
and
awaited
my
further
orders
the
carriage
i
had
followed
was
now
standing
in
front
of
a
house
and
just
as
i
rounded
the
corner
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
several
figures
crossing
the
banquette
and
entering
the
door
no
doubt
all
that
had
ridden
in
the
carriage
aurore
with
the
rest
had
gone
inside
the
house
presently
a
man
came
out
and
handing
his
fare
to
the
turned
and
went
back
into
the
house
the
latter
gathering
up
his
reins
gave
the
whip
to
his
horses
and
wheeling
round
came
back
by
the
rue
chartres
as
he
passed
me
i
glanced
through
the
open
windows
of
his
vehicle
it
was
empty
she
had
gone
into
the
house
then
i
had
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
where
she
had
been
taken
i
read
on
the
corner
rue
bienville
the
house
where
the
carriage
had
stopped
was
the
town
residence
of
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
i
remained
for
some
minutes
in
the
cab
considering
what
i
had
best
do
was
this
to
be
her
future
home
or
was
she
only
brought
here
temporarily
to
be
afterwards
taken
up
to
the
plantation
some
thought
or
instinct
perhaps
whispered
me
that
she
was
not
to
remain
in
the
rue
bienville
but
would
be
carried
to
the
gloomy
old
mansion
at
bringiers
i
can
not
tell
why
i
thought
so
perhaps
it
was
because
i
wished
it
so
i
saw
the
necessity
of
watching
the
house
so
that
she
might
not
be
taken
away
without
my
knowing
it
wherever
she
went
i
was
determined
to
follow
fortunately
i
was
prepared
for
any
journey
the
three
thousand
dollars
lent
me
by
remained
intact
with
that
i
could
travel
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
i
wished
that
the
young
creole
had
been
with
me
i
wanted
his
counsel
his
company
how
should
i
find
him
he
had
not
said
where
we
should
meet
only
that
he
would
join
me
when
the
sale
should
be
over
i
saw
nothing
of
him
on
leaving
the
rotundo
perhaps
he
meant
to
meet
me
there
or
at
my
hotel
but
how
was
i
to
get
back
to
either
of
these
places
without
leaving
my
post
i
was
perplexed
as
to
how
i
should
communicate
with
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
i
had
not
yet
dismissed
him
might
remain
and
watch
the
house
while
i
went
in
search
of
the
creole
i
had
only
to
pay
the
jehu
he
would
obey
me
of
course
and
right
willingly
i
was
about
arranging
with
the
man
and
had
already
given
him
some
instructions
when
i
heard
wheels
rumbling
along
the
street
and
a
somewhat
coach
drawn
by
a
pair
of
mules
turned
into
the
rue
bienville
a
negro
driver
was
upon
the
box
there
was
nothing
odd
in
all
this
such
a
carriage
and
such
a
coachman
were
to
be
seen
every
hour
in
new
orleans
and
drawn
by
mules
as
often
as
horses
but
this
pair
of
mules
and
the
negro
who
drove
them
i
recognised
yes
i
recognised
the
equipage
i
had
often
met
it
upon
the
levee
road
near
bringiers
it
was
the
carriage
of
monsieur
dominique
i
was
further
assured
upon
this
point
by
seeing
the
vehicle
draw
up
in
front
of
the
avocat
house
i
at
once
gave
up
my
design
of
going
back
for
climbing
back
into
the
hack
i
ensconced
myself
in
such
a
position
that
i
could
command
a
view
of
what
passed
in
the
rue
bienville
some
one
was
evidently
about
to
become
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
the
door
of
the
house
stood
open
and
a
servant
was
speaking
to
the
coachman
i
could
tell
by
the
actions
of
the
latter
that
he
expected
soon
to
drive
off
the
servant
now
appeared
outside
with
several
parcels
which
he
placed
upon
the
coach
then
a
man
came
out
the
who
mounted
the
box
another
man
shot
across
the
banquette
but
in
such
a
hurried
gait
that
i
could
not
recognise
him
i
guessed
however
who
was
two
others
now
came
from
the
house
a
mulatto
woman
and
a
young
girl
in
spite
of
the
cloak
in
which
she
was
enveloped
i
recognised
aurore
the
mulatto
woman
conducted
the
girl
to
the
carriage
and
then
stepped
in
after
at
this
moment
a
man
on
horseback
appeared
in
the
street
and
riding
up
halted
by
the
carriage
after
speaking
to
some
one
inside
he
again
put
his
horse
in
motion
and
rode
off
this
horseman
was
larkin
the
overseer
the
clash
of
the
closing
door
was
immediately
followed
by
the
crack
of
the
coachman
whip
and
the
mules
trotting
off
down
the
street
turned
to
the
right
and
headed
up
the
levee
my
driver
who
had
already
been
instructed
gave
the
whip
to
his
hack
and
followed
keeping
a
short
distance
in
the
rear
it
was
not
till
we
had
traversed
the
long
street
of
tehoupitoulas
through
the
faubourg
marigny
and
were
some
distance
upon
the
road
to
the
suburban
village
of
lafayette
that
i
thought
of
where
i
was
going
my
sole
idea
had
been
to
keep
in
sight
the
carriage
of
gayarre
i
now
bethought
me
for
what
purpose
i
was
driving
after
him
did
i
intend
to
follow
him
to
his
house
some
thirty
miles
distant
in
a
even
had
i
been
so
determined
it
was
questionable
whether
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
could
have
been
tempted
to
humour
my
caprice
or
whether
his
wretched
hack
could
have
accomplished
such
a
feat
for
what
purpose
then
was
i
galloping
after
to
overtake
these
men
upon
the
road
and
deliver
aurore
from
their
keeping
no
there
were
three
of
them
well
armed
no
doubt
and
i
alone
but
it
was
not
until
i
had
gone
several
miles
that
i
began
to
reflect
on
the
absurdity
of
my
conduct
i
then
ordered
my
coachman
to
pull
up
i
remained
seated
and
from
the
window
of
the
hack
gazed
after
the
carriage
until
it
was
hidden
by
a
turn
in
the
road
after
all
i
muttered
to
myself
i
have
done
right
in
following
i
am
now
sure
of
their
destination
back
to
the
hotel
saint
luis
the
last
phrase
was
a
command
to
my
coachman
who
turning
his
horse
drove
back
as
i
had
promised
to
pay
for
speed
it
was
not
long
before
the
wheels
of
my
hackney
rattled
over
the
pave
of
the
rue
saint
luis
having
dismissed
the
carriage
i
entered
the
hotel
to
my
joy
i
found
awaiting
my
return
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
communicated
to
him
my
determination
to
carry
off
aurore
bare
friendship
his
he
approved
of
my
resolve
rare
devotion
he
proposed
to
take
part
in
my
enterprise
i
warned
him
of
its
perils
to
no
purpose
with
an
enthusiasm
i
could
not
account
for
and
that
greatly
astonished
me
at
the
time
he
still
insisted
upon
sharing
them
perhaps
i
might
more
earnestly
have
admonished
him
against
such
a
purpose
but
i
felt
how
much
i
stood
in
need
of
him
i
could
not
explain
the
strange
feeling
of
confidence
with
which
the
presence
of
this
gentle
but
heroic
youth
had
inspired
me
the
reluctance
with
which
i
accepted
his
offer
was
only
apparent
it
was
not
felt
my
heart
was
struggling
against
my
will
i
was
but
too
glad
when
he
stated
his
determination
to
accompany
me
there
was
no
boat
going
up
that
night
but
we
were
not
without
the
means
to
travel
a
pair
of
horses
were
hired
the
best
that
money
could
procure
and
before
we
had
cleared
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
were
riding
along
the
road
that
conducts
to
the
village
of
bringiers
chapter
sixty
four
two
villains
we
travelled
rapidly
there
were
no
hills
to
impede
our
progress
our
route
lay
along
the
levee
road
which
leads
from
new
orleans
by
the
bank
of
the
river
passing
plantations
and
settlements
at
every
few
hundred
yards
distance
the
path
was
as
level
as
a
and
the
hoof
fell
gently
upon
the
soft
dusty
surface
enabling
us
to
ride
with
ease
the
horses
we
bestrode
were
from
the
prairies
of
texas
trained
to
that
gait
the
pace
peculiar
to
the
of
the
states
excellent
pacers
both
were
and
before
the
night
came
down
we
had
made
more
than
half
of
our
journey
up
to
this
time
we
had
exchanged
only
a
few
words
i
was
busy
with
my
thoughts
busy
planning
my
enterprise
my
young
companion
appeared
equally
occupied
with
his
the
darkening
down
of
the
night
brought
us
closer
together
and
i
now
unfolded
to
the
plan
which
i
had
proposed
to
myself
there
was
not
much
of
plan
about
it
my
intention
was
simply
this
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
plantation
of
gayarre
stealthily
to
approach
the
house
to
communicate
with
aurore
through
some
of
the
slaves
of
the
plantation
failing
in
this
to
find
out
if
possible
in
what
part
of
the
house
she
would
pass
the
night
to
enter
her
room
after
all
had
gone
to
sleep
propose
to
her
to
fly
with
me
and
then
make
our
escape
the
best
way
we
could
once
clear
of
the
house
i
had
scarce
thought
of
a
plan
of
action
that
seemed
easy
enough
our
horses
would
carry
us
back
to
the
city
there
we
might
remain
concealed
until
some
friendly
ship
should
bear
us
from
the
country
this
was
all
the
plan
i
had
conceived
and
having
communicated
it
to
i
awaited
his
response
after
some
moments
silence
he
replied
signifying
his
approval
of
it
like
me
he
could
think
of
no
other
course
to
be
followed
aurore
must
be
carried
away
at
all
hazards
we
now
conversed
about
the
details
we
debated
every
chance
of
failure
and
success
our
main
difficulty
both
agreed
would
be
in
communicating
with
aurore
could
we
do
so
surely
she
would
not
be
locked
in
surely
gayarre
would
not
be
suspicious
enough
to
have
her
guarded
and
watched
he
was
now
the
full
owner
of
this
coveted
treasure
no
one
could
legally
deprive
him
of
his
slave
no
one
could
carry
her
away
without
the
risk
of
a
fearful
punishment
and
although
he
no
doubt
suspected
that
some
understanding
existed
between
the
quadroon
and
myself
i
would
never
dream
of
such
a
love
as
that
which
i
felt
a
love
that
would
lead
me
to
risk
even
life
itself
as
i
now
intended
no
gayarre
judging
from
his
own
vile
passion
might
believe
that
i
like
himself
had
been
struck
with
the
girl
beauty
and
that
i
was
willing
to
pay
a
certain
sum
three
thousand
dollars
to
possess
her
but
the
fact
that
i
had
bid
no
more
no
doubt
exactly
reported
to
him
by
his
agent
was
proof
that
my
love
had
its
limits
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
as
a
rival
he
would
hear
of
me
no
more
no
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
would
never
suspect
a
passion
like
mine
would
never
dream
of
such
a
purpose
as
the
one
to
which
that
passion
now
impelled
me
an
enterprise
so
romantic
was
not
within
the
bounds
of
probability
therefore
so
reasoned
and
i
it
was
not
likely
aurore
would
be
either
guarded
or
watched
but
even
though
she
might
not
be
how
were
we
to
communicate
with
her
that
would
be
extremely
difficult
i
built
my
hopes
on
the
little
slip
of
paper
on
the
words
soir
surely
upon
this
night
aurore
would
my
heart
told
me
she
would
not
and
the
thought
rendered
me
proud
and
sanguine
that
very
night
should
i
make
the
attempt
to
carry
her
off
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
she
should
pass
even
a
single
night
under
the
roof
of
her
tyrant
and
the
night
promised
to
befriend
us
the
sun
had
scarcely
gone
down
when
the
sky
became
sullen
turning
to
the
hue
of
lead
as
soon
as
the
short
twilight
passed
the
whole
canopy
had
grown
so
dark
that
we
could
scarce
distinguish
the
outline
of
the
forest
from
the
sky
itself
not
a
star
could
be
seen
a
thick
pall
of
clouds
hid
them
from
the
view
even
the
yellow
surface
of
the
river
was
scarce
perceptible
from
its
bank
and
the
white
dust
of
the
road
alone
guided
us
in
the
woods
or
upon
the
darker
ground
of
the
plantation
fields
to
find
a
path
would
have
been
impossible
so
intense
was
the
darkness
that
enveloped
us
we
might
have
augured
trouble
from
this
we
might
have
feared
losing
our
way
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
any
such
result
i
felt
assured
that
the
star
of
love
itself
would
guide
me
the
darkness
would
be
in
our
favour
under
its
friendly
shadow
we
could
approach
the
house
and
act
with
safety
whereas
had
it
been
a
moonlight
night
we
should
have
been
in
great
danger
of
being
discovered
i
read
in
the
sudden
change
of
sky
no
ill
augury
but
an
omen
of
success
there
were
signs
of
an
approaching
storm
what
to
me
would
have
been
kindly
weather
anything
a
a
tempest
a
hurricane
anything
but
a
fine
night
was
what
i
desired
it
was
still
early
when
we
reached
the
plantation
besancon
not
quite
midnight
we
had
lost
no
time
on
the
road
our
object
in
hurrying
forward
was
to
arrive
at
the
place
before
the
household
of
gayarre
should
go
to
rest
our
hopes
were
that
we
might
find
some
means
of
communicating
with
aurore
through
the
slaves
one
of
those
i
know
i
had
done
him
a
slight
favour
during
my
residence
at
bringiers
i
had
gained
his
confidence
enough
to
render
him
accessible
to
a
bribe
he
might
be
found
and
might
render
us
the
desired
assistance
all
was
silent
upon
the
plantation
besancon
the
appeared
deserted
there
were
no
lights
to
be
seen
one
glimmered
in
the
rear
in
a
window
of
the
overseer
house
the
negro
quarter
was
dark
and
silent
the
buzz
usual
at
that
hour
was
not
heard
they
whose
voices
used
to
echo
through
its
little
street
were
now
far
away
the
cabins
were
empty
the
song
the
jest
and
the
cheerful
laugh
were
hushed
and
the
howling
for
his
absent
master
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
of
the
place
we
passed
the
gate
riding
in
silence
and
watching
the
road
in
front
of
us
we
were
observing
the
greatest
caution
as
we
advanced
we
might
meet
those
whom
above
all
others
we
desired
not
to
encounter
the
overseer
the
agent
gayarre
himself
even
to
have
been
seen
by
one
of
gayarre
negroes
might
have
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
our
plans
so
fearful
was
i
of
this
that
but
for
the
darkness
of
the
night
i
should
have
left
the
road
sooner
and
tried
a
path
through
the
woods
which
i
knew
of
it
was
too
dark
to
traverse
this
path
without
difficulty
and
loss
of
time
we
therefore
clung
to
the
road
intending
to
leave
it
when
we
should
arrive
opposite
the
plantation
of
gayarre
between
the
two
plantations
a
for
led
to
the
forest
it
was
this
road
i
intended
to
take
we
should
not
be
likely
to
meet
any
one
upon
it
and
it
was
our
design
to
conceal
our
horses
among
the
trees
in
the
rear
of
the
on
such
a
night
not
even
the
negro
would
have
any
business
in
the
woods
creeping
along
with
caution
we
had
arrived
near
the
point
where
this
when
voices
reached
our
ears
some
persons
were
coming
down
the
road
we
reined
up
and
listened
there
were
men
in
conversation
and
from
their
voices
each
moment
growing
more
distinct
we
could
tell
that
they
were
approaching
us
they
were
coming
down
the
main
road
from
the
direction
of
the
village
the
told
us
they
were
on
horseback
and
consequently
that
they
were
white
men
a
large
tree
stood
on
the
waste
ground
on
one
side
of
the
road
the
long
flakes
of
spanish
moss
hanging
from
its
branches
nearly
touched
the
ground
it
offered
the
readiest
place
of
concealment
and
we
had
just
time
to
spur
our
horses
behind
its
giant
trunk
when
the
horsemen
came
abreast
of
the
tree
dark
as
it
was
we
could
see
them
in
passing
their
forms
two
of
them
there
were
were
faintly
outlined
against
the
yellow
surface
of
the
water
had
they
been
silent
we
might
have
remained
in
ignorance
as
to
who
they
were
but
their
voices
betrayed
them
they
were
larkin
and
the
trader
good
whispered
as
we
recognised
them
they
have
left
gayarre
they
are
on
their
way
home
to
the
plantation
besancon
the
very
same
thought
had
occurred
to
myself
no
doubt
they
were
returning
to
their
homes
the
overseer
to
the
plantation
besancon
and
the
trader
to
his
own
house
which
i
know
to
be
farther
down
the
coast
i
now
remembered
having
often
seen
this
man
in
company
with
gayarre
the
thought
had
occurred
to
myself
as
spoke
but
how
knew
he
must
be
well
acquainted
with
the
country
thought
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
or
ask
him
any
question
the
conversation
of
these
two
ruffians
for
ruffians
both
were
occupied
all
my
attention
they
were
evidently
in
high
glee
laughing
as
they
went
and
jesting
as
they
talked
no
doubt
their
vile
work
had
been
remunerative
wal
bill
said
the
trader
it
air
the
biggest
price
i
ever
giv
for
a
nigger
darn
the
old
french
fool
he
paid
well
for
his
whistle
this
time
he
ai
allers
so
dog
darned
if
he
is
wal
she
air
dear
an
she
ai
when
a
man
has
the
dollars
to
spare
she
as
putty
a
piece
o
goods
as
there
air
in
all
louisiana
i
would
mind
myself
ha
ha
ha
boisterously
laughed
the
overseer
i
guess
you
can
get
a
chance
if
you
a
mind
to
he
added
in
a
significant
tone
say
bill
tell
me
be
candid
old
feller
have
you
ever
wal
to
tell
the
truth
i
hai
but
i
reckon
i
mout
if
i
had
pushed
the
thing
i
wa
long
enough
on
the
plantation
beside
she
so
stuck
up
with
cussed
pride
an
larnin
that
she
thinks
herself
as
good
as
white
i
calclate
old
foxey
bring
down
her
notions
a
bit
she
wo
be
long
wi
him
till
she
be
glad
to
take
a
ramble
in
the
woods
wi
anybody
that
asks
her
there
be
chance
enough
yet
i
reckon
the
trader
muttered
some
reply
to
this
prophetic
speech
but
both
were
now
so
distant
that
their
conversation
was
no
longer
audible
what
i
had
heard
absurd
as
it
was
caused
me
a
feeling
of
pain
and
if
possible
heightened
my
desire
to
save
aurore
from
the
terrible
fate
that
awaited
her
giving
the
word
to
my
companion
we
rode
out
from
behind
the
tree
and
a
few
minutes
after
turned
into
the
that
led
to
the
woods
chapter
sixty
five
the
pawpaw
thicket
our
progress
along
this
was
slow
there
was
no
white
dust
upon
the
path
to
guide
us
we
had
to
grope
our
way
as
well
as
we
could
between
the
zigzag
fences
now
and
then
our
horses
stumbled
in
the
deep
ruts
made
by
the
and
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
force
them
forward
my
companion
seemed
to
manage
better
than
i
and
whipped
his
horse
onward
as
if
he
were
more
familiar
with
the
path
or
else
more
reckless
i
wondered
at
this
without
making
any
remark
after
struggling
we
reached
the
angle
of
the
where
the
enclosure
ended
and
the
woods
began
another
hundred
yards
brought
us
under
the
shadow
of
the
tall
timber
where
we
reined
up
to
take
breath
and
concert
what
was
next
to
be
done
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
pawpaw
thicket
near
this
place
if
we
could
find
it
i
said
to
my
companion
and
leave
our
horses
there
we
may
easily
do
that
was
the
reply
though
is
scarce
worth
while
searching
for
a
thicket
the
darkness
will
sufficiently
conceal
ha
not
so
as
spoke
a
blue
flash
lit
up
the
whole
canopy
of
heaven
even
the
gloomy
aisles
of
the
forest
were
illuminated
so
that
we
could
distinguish
the
trunks
and
branches
of
the
trees
to
a
long
distance
around
us
the
light
wavered
for
some
seconds
like
a
lamp
about
being
extinguished
and
then
went
suddenly
out
leaving
the
darkness
more
opaque
than
before
there
was
no
noise
accompanying
this
phenomenon
at
least
none
produced
by
the
lightning
itself
it
caused
some
noise
however
among
the
wild
creatures
of
the
woods
it
woke
the
haliaetus
perched
upon
the
head
of
the
tall
taxodium
and
his
maniac
laugh
sounded
harsh
and
shrill
it
woke
the
grallatores
of
the
swamp
the
the
curlews
and
the
tall
blue
herons
who
screamed
in
concert
the
owl
already
awake
hooted
louder
its
solemn
note
and
from
the
deep
profound
of
the
forest
came
the
howl
of
the
wolf
and
the
more
thrilling
cry
of
the
cougar
all
nature
seemed
startled
by
this
sudden
blaze
of
light
that
filled
the
firmament
but
the
moment
after
all
was
darkness
and
silence
as
before
the
storm
will
soon
be
on
i
suggested
no
said
my
companion
there
will
be
no
storm
you
hear
no
thunder
when
it
is
thus
we
shall
have
no
rain
a
very
black
night
with
lightning
at
intervals
nothing
more
again
the
exclamation
was
drawn
forth
by
a
second
blaze
of
lightning
that
like
the
first
lit
up
the
woods
on
all
sides
around
us
and
as
before
unaccompanied
by
thunder
neither
the
slightest
rumble
nor
clap
was
heard
but
the
wild
creatures
once
more
uttered
their
varied
cries
we
must
conceal
the
horses
then
said
my
companion
some
straggler
might
be
abroad
and
with
this
light
they
could
be
seen
far
off
the
pawpaw
thicket
is
the
very
place
let
us
seek
it
it
lies
in
this
direction
rode
forward
among
the
i
followed
mechanically
i
felt
satisfied
he
know
the
ground
better
than
i
he
must
have
been
here
before
was
my
reflection
we
had
not
gone
many
steps
before
the
blue
light
blazed
a
third
time
and
we
could
see
directly
in
front
of
us
the
smooth
shining
branches
and
broad
green
leaves
of
the
forming
the
underwood
of
the
forest
when
the
lightning
flashed
again
we
had
entered
the
thicket
dismounting
in
its
midst
we
hastily
tied
our
bridles
to
the
branches
and
then
leaving
our
horses
to
themselves
we
returned
towards
the
open
ground
ten
minutes
walking
enabled
us
to
regain
the
zigzag
railing
that
shut
in
the
plantation
of
gayarre
directing
ourselves
along
this
in
ten
minutes
after
we
arrived
opposite
the
house
which
by
the
electric
blaze
we
could
distinguish
shining
among
the
tall
trees
that
grew
around
it
at
this
point
we
again
made
a
stop
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
consider
how
we
should
proceed
a
wide
field
stretched
from
the
fence
almost
to
the
walls
a
garden
enclosed
by
palings
lay
between
the
field
and
the
house
and
on
one
side
we
could
perceive
the
roofs
of
numerous
cabins
denoting
the
negro
quarter
at
some
distance
in
the
same
direction
stood
the
and
other
outbuildings
and
near
these
the
house
of
gayarre
overseer
this
point
was
to
be
avoided
even
the
negro
quarter
must
be
shunned
lest
we
might
give
alarm
the
dogs
would
be
our
worst
enemies
i
knew
that
gayarre
kept
several
i
had
often
seen
them
along
the
roads
large
fierce
animals
they
were
how
were
they
to
be
shunned
they
would
most
likely
be
rambling
about
the
outbuildings
or
the
negro
cabins
therefore
our
safest
way
would
be
to
approach
from
the
opposite
side
if
we
should
fail
to
discover
the
apartment
of
aurore
then
it
would
be
time
to
make
reconnaissance
in
the
direction
of
the
quarter
and
endeavour
to
find
the
boy
caton
we
saw
lights
in
the
house
several
windows
all
upon
the
were
shining
through
the
darkness
more
than
one
apartment
therefore
was
occupied
this
gave
us
hope
one
of
them
might
be
occupied
by
aurore
and
now
monsieur
said
after
we
had
discussed
the
various
details
suppose
we
fail
suppose
some
alarm
be
given
and
we
be
detected
before
i
turned
and
looking
my
young
companion
full
in
the
face
interrupted
him
in
what
he
was
about
to
say
said
i
perhaps
i
may
never
be
able
to
repay
your
generous
friendship
it
has
already
exceeded
all
bounds
but
you
must
not
risk
for
me
that
i
can
not
permit
and
how
risk
life
monsieur
if
i
fail
if
alarm
be
given
if
i
am
opposed
i
opened
the
breast
of
my
coat
exposing
to
his
view
my
pistols
yes
i
continued
i
am
reckless
enough
i
shall
use
them
if
necessary
i
shall
take
life
if
it
stand
in
the
way
i
am
resolved
but
you
must
not
risk
an
encounter
you
must
remain
here
i
shall
go
to
the
house
alone
no
no
he
answered
promptly
i
go
with
you
i
can
not
permit
it
monsieur
it
is
better
for
you
to
remain
here
you
can
stay
by
the
fence
until
i
return
to
you
until
return
i
should
say
for
i
come
not
back
without
do
not
act
rashly
monsieur
no
but
i
am
determined
i
am
desperate
we
must
not
go
farther
and
why
not
too
have
an
interest
in
this
you
i
asked
surprised
at
the
words
as
well
as
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
you
an
interest
of
course
coolly
replied
my
companion
i
love
adventure
that
gives
me
an
interest
you
must
permit
me
to
accompany
you
i
must
go
along
with
you
as
you
will
then
monsieur
fear
not
i
shall
act
with
prudence
come
on
i
sprang
over
the
fence
followed
by
my
companion
and
without
another
word
having
passed
between
us
we
struck
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
the
house
chapter
sixty
six
the
elopement
it
was
a
field
of
the
canes
were
of
that
species
known
as
ratoons
suckers
from
old
roots
and
the
thick
bunches
at
their
bases
as
well
as
the
tall
columns
enabled
us
to
pass
among
them
unobserved
even
had
it
been
day
we
might
have
approached
the
house
unseen
we
soon
reached
the
here
we
stopped
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
a
short
survey
was
sufficient
we
saw
the
very
place
where
we
could
approach
and
conceal
ourselves
the
house
had
an
antique
look
not
without
some
pretensions
to
grandeur
it
was
a
wooden
building
two
stories
in
height
with
gable
roofs
and
large
windows
all
of
which
had
venetian
shutters
that
opened
to
the
outside
both
walls
and
had
once
been
painted
but
the
paint
was
old
and
rusty
and
the
colour
of
the
venetians
once
green
could
hardly
be
distinguished
from
the
grey
of
the
walls
all
round
the
house
ran
an
open
gallery
or
verandah
raised
some
three
or
four
feet
from
the
ground
upon
this
gallery
the
windows
and
doors
opened
and
a
paling
or
encompassed
the
whole
opposite
the
doors
a
stairway
of
steps
led
up
but
at
all
other
parts
the
space
underneath
was
open
in
front
so
that
by
stooping
a
little
one
might
get
under
the
floor
of
the
gallery
by
crawling
close
up
in
front
of
the
verandah
and
looking
through
the
rails
we
should
be
able
to
command
a
full
view
of
all
the
windows
in
the
house
and
in
case
of
alarm
we
could
conceal
ourselves
in
the
dark
cavity
underneath
we
should
be
safe
there
unless
scented
by
the
dogs
our
plan
was
matured
in
whispers
it
was
not
much
of
a
plan
we
were
to
advance
to
the
edge
of
the
verandah
peep
through
the
windows
until
we
could
discover
the
apartment
of
aurore
then
do
our
best
to
communicate
with
her
and
get
her
out
our
success
depended
greatly
upon
accident
or
good
fortune
before
we
could
make
a
move
forward
fortune
seemed
as
though
she
was
going
to
favour
us
in
one
of
the
windows
directly
before
our
face
a
figure
appeared
a
glance
told
us
it
was
the
quadroon
the
window
as
before
stated
reached
down
to
the
floor
of
the
verandah
and
as
the
figure
appeared
behind
the
glass
we
could
see
it
from
head
to
foot
the
madras
kerchief
on
the
head
the
gracefully
undulating
figure
outlined
upon
the
background
of
the
lighted
room
left
no
doubt
upon
our
minds
as
to
who
it
was
is
aurore
whispered
my
companion
how
could
tell
did
he
know
her
all
i
remembered
he
had
seen
her
that
morning
in
the
rotundo
it
is
she
i
replied
my
beating
heart
scarce
allowing
me
to
make
utterance
the
window
was
curtained
but
she
had
raised
the
curtain
in
one
hand
and
was
looking
out
there
was
that
in
her
attitude
that
betokened
earnestness
she
appeared
as
if
trying
to
penetrate
the
gloom
even
in
the
distance
i
could
perceive
this
and
my
heart
bounded
with
joy
she
had
understood
my
note
she
was
looking
for
me
thought
so
as
well
our
prospects
were
brightening
if
she
guessed
our
design
our
task
would
be
easier
she
remained
but
a
few
moments
by
the
window
she
turned
away
and
the
curtain
dropped
into
its
place
but
before
it
had
screened
the
view
the
dark
shadow
of
a
man
fell
against
the
back
wall
of
the
room
gayarre
no
doubt
i
could
hold
back
no
longer
but
climbing
over
the
i
crept
forward
followed
by
in
a
few
seconds
both
of
us
had
gained
the
desired
position
directly
in
front
of
the
window
from
which
we
were
now
separated
only
by
the
of
the
verandah
standing
our
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
floor
of
the
room
the
curtain
had
not
fallen
properly
into
its
place
a
single
pane
of
the
glass
remained
unscreened
and
through
this
we
could
see
nearly
the
whole
interior
of
the
apartment
our
ears
too
were
at
the
proper
elevation
to
catch
every
sound
and
persons
conversing
within
the
room
we
could
hear
distinctly
we
were
right
in
our
conjecture
it
was
aurore
we
had
seen
gayarre
was
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
i
shall
not
paint
that
scene
i
shall
not
repeat
the
words
to
which
we
listened
i
shall
not
detail
the
speeches
of
that
mean
villain
at
first
fulsome
and
flattering
then
coarse
bold
and
brutal
until
at
length
failing
to
effect
his
purpose
by
entreaties
he
had
recourse
to
threats
held
me
back
begging
me
in
earnest
whispers
to
be
patient
once
or
twice
i
had
almost
determined
to
spring
forward
dash
aside
the
sash
and
strike
the
ruffian
to
the
floor
thanks
to
the
prudent
interference
of
my
companion
i
restrained
myself
the
scene
ended
by
gayarre
going
out
of
the
room
indignant
but
somewhat
the
bold
upright
bearing
of
the
quadroon
whose
strength
at
least
equalled
that
of
her
puny
assailant
had
evidently
intimidated
him
for
the
moment
else
he
might
have
resorted
to
personal
violence
his
threats
however
as
he
took
his
departure
left
no
doubt
of
his
intention
soon
to
renew
his
brutal
assault
he
felt
certain
of
his
victim
she
was
his
slave
and
must
yield
he
had
ample
time
and
opportunity
he
need
not
at
once
proceed
to
extremes
he
could
wait
until
his
valour
somewhat
cowed
should
return
again
and
imbue
him
with
a
fresh
impulse
the
disappearance
of
gayarre
gave
us
an
opportunity
to
make
our
presence
known
to
aurore
i
was
about
to
climb
up
to
the
verandah
and
tap
on
the
glass
but
my
companion
prevented
me
from
doing
so
it
is
not
necessary
he
whispered
she
certainly
knows
you
will
be
here
leave
it
to
she
will
return
to
the
window
presently
patience
monsieur
a
false
step
will
ruin
all
remember
the
dogs
there
was
prudence
in
these
counsels
and
i
gave
way
to
them
a
few
minutes
would
decide
and
we
both
crouched
close
and
watched
the
movements
of
the
quadroon
the
apartment
in
which
she
was
attracted
our
notice
it
was
not
the
of
the
house
nor
yet
a
bedroom
it
was
a
sort
of
library
or
studio
as
shelves
filled
with
books
and
a
table
covered
with
papers
and
testified
it
was
no
doubt
the
office
of
the
avocat
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
do
his
writing
why
was
aurore
in
that
room
such
a
question
occurred
to
us
but
we
had
little
time
to
dwell
upon
it
my
companion
suggested
that
as
they
had
just
arrived
she
may
have
been
placed
there
while
an
apartment
was
being
prepared
for
her
the
voices
of
servants
overhead
and
the
noise
of
furniture
being
moved
over
the
floor
was
what
led
him
to
make
this
suggestion
it
was
just
as
if
a
room
was
being
set
in
order
this
led
me
into
a
new
train
of
reflection
she
might
be
suddenly
removed
from
the
library
and
taken
it
would
then
be
more
difficult
to
communicate
with
her
it
would
be
better
to
make
the
attempt
at
once
contrary
to
the
wish
of
i
was
about
to
advance
forward
to
the
window
when
the
movements
of
aurore
herself
caused
me
to
hesitate
the
door
through
which
gayarre
had
just
made
his
exit
was
visible
from
where
we
stood
i
saw
the
quadroon
approach
this
with
silent
tread
as
if
meditating
some
design
placing
her
hand
upon
the
key
she
turned
it
in
the
lock
so
that
the
door
was
thus
bolted
inside
with
what
design
had
she
doing
this
it
occurred
to
us
that
she
was
about
to
make
her
escape
out
by
the
window
and
that
she
had
fastened
the
door
for
the
purpose
of
delaying
pursuit
if
so
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
remain
quiet
and
leave
her
to
complete
the
design
it
would
be
time
enough
to
warn
her
of
our
presence
when
she
should
reach
the
window
this
was
advice
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
a
large
mahogany
desk
and
over
its
head
was
ranged
a
screen
of
of
the
kind
known
as
these
were
filled
with
papers
and
parchments
no
doubt
wills
deeds
and
other
documents
relating
to
the
business
of
the
lawyer
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
the
quadroon
as
soon
as
she
had
secured
the
door
hastily
approach
this
desk
and
stand
directly
in
front
of
it
her
eyes
eagerly
bent
upon
the
shelves
as
though
she
was
in
search
of
some
document
such
was
in
reality
the
case
for
she
now
stretched
forth
her
hand
drew
a
bundle
of
folded
papers
from
the
box
and
after
resting
her
eyes
upon
them
for
a
moment
suddenly
concealed
them
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
heavens
i
mentally
ejaculated
what
can
it
mean
i
had
no
time
to
give
way
to
conjectures
for
in
a
second
time
aurore
had
glided
across
the
floor
and
was
standing
in
the
window
as
she
raised
the
curtain
the
light
streamed
full
on
the
faces
of
myself
and
my
companion
and
at
the
first
glance
she
saw
us
a
slight
exclamation
escaped
her
but
it
was
of
joy
not
surprise
and
she
suddenly
checked
herself
the
ejaculation
was
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
across
the
room
the
sash
opened
noiselessly
with
silent
tread
the
verandah
was
crossed
and
in
another
moment
my
betrothed
was
in
my
arms
i
lifted
her
over
the
balustrade
and
we
passed
hastily
along
the
walks
of
the
garden
the
outer
field
was
reached
without
any
alarm
having
been
given
and
directing
ourselves
between
the
rows
of
the
canes
we
speeded
on
towards
the
woods
that
loomed
up
like
a
dark
wall
in
the
distance
chapter
sixty
seven
the
lost
mustangs
the
lightning
continued
to
play
at
intervals
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
our
way
we
recrossed
near
the
same
place
where
we
had
entered
the
field
and
guiding
ourselves
along
the
fence
hurried
on
towards
the
thicket
of
pawpaws
where
we
had
left
our
horses
my
design
was
to
take
to
the
road
at
once
and
endeavour
to
reach
the
city
before
daybreak
once
there
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
keep
concealed
both
myself
and
my
betrothed
until
some
opportunity
offered
of
getting
out
to
sea
or
up
the
river
to
one
of
the
free
states
i
never
thought
of
taking
to
the
woods
chance
had
made
me
acquainted
with
a
rare
and
no
doubt
we
might
have
found
concealment
there
for
a
time
the
advantage
of
this
had
crossed
my
mind
but
i
did
not
entertain
the
idea
for
a
moment
such
a
refuge
could
be
but
temporary
we
should
have
to
flee
from
it
in
the
end
and
the
difficulty
of
escaping
from
the
country
would
be
as
great
as
ever
either
for
victim
or
criminal
there
is
no
place
of
concealment
so
safe
as
the
crowded
haunts
of
the
populous
city
and
in
new
orleans
half
of
which
consists
of
a
floating
population
incognito
is
especially
easily
to
be
preserved
my
design
therefore
and
approved
it
was
to
mount
our
horses
and
make
direct
for
the
city
hard
work
i
had
cut
out
for
our
poor
animals
especially
the
one
that
should
have
to
carry
double
tough
hacks
they
were
and
had
done
the
journey
up
cleverly
enough
but
it
would
stretch
all
their
muscle
to
take
us
back
before
daylight
aided
by
the
flashes
we
wound
our
way
amid
the
trunks
of
the
trees
until
at
length
we
came
within
sight
of
the
pawpaw
thicket
easily
distinguished
by
the
large
oblong
leaves
of
the
which
had
a
whitish
sheen
under
the
electric
light
we
hurried
forward
with
joyful
anticipation
once
mounted
we
should
soon
get
beyond
the
reach
of
pursuit
strange
the
horses
do
not
neigh
or
give
some
sign
of
their
presence
one
would
have
thought
our
approach
would
have
startled
them
but
no
there
is
no
whimper
no
yet
we
must
be
close
to
them
now
i
never
knew
of
horses
remaining
so
still
what
can
they
be
doing
where
are
they
ay
where
are
they
echoed
surely
this
is
the
spot
where
we
left
them
here
it
certainly
was
yes
here
this
is
the
very
sapling
to
which
i
fastened
my
bridle
see
here
are
their
by
heaven
the
are
i
uttered
this
with
a
full
conviction
of
its
truth
there
was
no
room
left
for
doubt
there
was
the
trampled
earth
where
they
had
stood
there
the
very
tree
to
which
we
had
tied
them
i
easily
recognised
it
for
it
was
the
largest
in
the
grove
who
had
taken
them
away
this
was
the
question
that
first
occurred
to
us
some
one
had
been
dogging
us
or
had
it
been
some
one
who
had
come
across
the
animals
by
accident
the
latter
supposition
was
the
less
probable
who
would
have
been
wandering
in
the
woods
on
such
a
night
or
even
if
any
one
had
what
would
have
taken
them
into
the
pawpaw
thicket
ha
a
new
thought
came
into
my
head
perhaps
the
horses
had
got
loose
of
themselves
that
was
likely
enough
well
we
should
be
able
to
tell
as
soon
as
the
lightning
flashed
again
whether
they
had
set
themselves
free
or
whether
some
human
hand
had
undone
the
knotted
bridles
we
stood
by
the
tree
waiting
for
the
light
it
did
not
tarry
long
and
when
it
came
it
enabled
us
to
solve
the
doubt
my
conjecture
was
correct
the
horses
had
freed
themselves
the
broken
branches
told
the
tale
something
the
lightning
or
more
likely
a
prowling
wild
beast
had
them
and
they
had
broken
off
into
the
woods
we
now
reproached
ourselves
for
having
so
negligently
fastened
them
for
having
tied
them
to
a
branch
of
the
whose
soft
succulent
wood
possesses
scarcely
the
toughness
of
an
ordinary
herbaceous
plant
i
was
rather
pleased
at
the
discovery
that
the
animals
had
freed
themselves
there
was
a
hope
they
had
not
strayed
far
we
might
yet
find
them
near
at
hand
with
trailing
bridles
cropping
the
grass
without
loss
of
time
we
went
in
search
of
them
took
one
direction
i
another
while
aurore
remained
in
the
thicket
of
the
pawpaws
i
ranged
around
the
neighbourhood
went
back
to
the
fence
followed
it
to
the
road
and
even
went
some
distance
along
the
road
i
searched
every
nook
among
the
trees
pushed
through
thickets
and
and
whenever
it
flashed
examined
the
ground
for
tracks
at
intervals
i
returned
to
the
point
of
starting
to
find
that
had
been
equally
unsuccessful
after
nearly
an
hour
spent
in
this
fruitless
search
i
resolved
to
give
it
up
i
had
no
longer
a
hope
of
finding
the
horses
and
with
despairing
step
i
turned
once
more
in
the
direction
of
the
thicket
had
arrived
before
me
as
i
approached
the
quivering
gleam
enabled
me
to
distinguish
his
figure
he
was
standing
beside
aurore
he
was
conversing
familiarly
with
her
i
fancied
he
was
to
her
and
that
she
seemed
pleased
there
was
something
in
this
slight
scene
that
made
a
painful
impression
upon
me
neither
had
he
found
any
traces
of
the
missing
steeds
it
was
no
use
looking
any
longer
for
them
and
we
agreed
to
discontinue
the
search
and
pass
the
night
in
the
woods
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
consented
to
this
but
we
had
no
alternative
afoot
we
could
not
possibly
reach
new
orleans
before
morning
and
to
have
been
found
on
the
road
after
daybreak
would
have
insured
our
capture
such
as
we
could
not
pass
without
observation
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
at
the
earliest
hour
a
pursuing
party
would
take
the
road
to
the
city
our
most
prudent
plan
was
to
remain
all
night
where
we
were
and
renew
our
search
for
the
horses
as
soon
as
it
became
day
if
we
should
succeed
in
finding
them
we
might
conceal
them
in
the
swamp
till
the
following
night
and
then
make
for
the
city
if
we
should
not
recover
them
then
by
starting
at
an
earlier
hour
we
might
attempt
the
journey
on
foot
the
loss
of
the
horses
had
placed
us
in
an
unexpected
dilemma
it
had
seriously
diminished
our
chances
of
escape
and
increased
the
peril
of
our
position
i
have
said
and
in
such
we
stood
peril
of
no
trifling
kind
you
will
with
difficulty
comprehend
the
nature
of
our
situation
you
will
imagine
yourself
reading
the
account
of
some
ordinary
escapade
a
mere
runaway
match
la
gretna
rid
yourself
of
this
fancy
know
that
all
three
of
us
had
committed
an
act
for
which
we
were
amenable
know
that
my
rendered
me
liable
to
certain
and
severe
punishment
by
the
of
the
that
a
still
more
terrible
sentence
might
be
feared
the
laws
of
the
i
knew
all
this
i
knew
that
life
itself
was
imperilled
by
the
act
i
had
committed
think
of
our
danger
and
it
may
enable
you
to
form
some
idea
of
what
were
our
feelings
after
returning
from
our
bootless
hunt
after
the
horses
we
had
no
choice
but
stay
where
we
were
till
morning
we
spent
in
dragging
the
from
the
trees
and
collecting
the
soft
leaves
of
the
pawpaws
with
these
i
strewed
the
ground
and
placing
aurore
upon
it
i
covered
her
with
my
cloak
for
myself
i
needed
no
couch
i
sat
down
near
my
beloved
with
my
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
i
would
fain
have
pillowed
her
head
upon
my
breast
but
the
presence
of
restrained
me
even
that
might
not
have
hindered
me
but
the
slight
proposal
which
i
made
had
been
declined
by
aurore
even
the
hand
that
i
had
taken
in
mine
was
respectfully
withdrawn
i
will
confess
that
this
coyness
surprised
and
piqued
me
chapter
sixty
eight
a
night
in
the
woods
lightly
clad
as
i
was
the
cold
dews
of
the
night
would
have
prevented
me
from
sleeping
but
i
needed
not
that
to
keep
me
awake
i
could
not
have
slept
upon
a
couch
of
eider
had
generously
offered
me
his
cloak
which
i
declined
he
too
was
clad
in
cottonade
and
linen
though
that
was
not
the
reason
for
my
declining
his
offer
even
had
i
been
suffering
i
could
not
have
accepted
it
i
began
to
fear
him
aurore
was
soon
asleep
the
lightning
showed
me
that
her
eyes
were
closed
and
i
could
tell
by
her
soft
regular
breathing
that
she
slept
this
too
annoyed
me
i
watched
for
each
new
gleam
that
i
might
look
upon
her
each
time
as
the
quivering
light
illumined
her
lovely
features
i
gazed
upon
them
with
mingled
feelings
of
passion
and
pain
oh
could
there
be
falsehood
under
that
fair
face
could
sin
exist
in
that
noble
soul
after
all
was
i
beloved
even
so
there
was
no
withdrawing
now
no
going
back
from
my
purpose
the
race
in
which
i
had
embarked
must
be
run
to
the
end
even
at
the
sacrifice
both
of
heart
and
life
i
thought
only
of
the
purpose
that
had
brought
us
there
as
my
mind
became
calmer
i
again
reflected
on
the
means
of
carrying
it
out
as
soon
as
day
should
break
i
would
go
in
search
of
the
horses
track
them
if
possible
to
where
they
had
strayed
recover
them
and
then
remain
concealed
in
the
woods
until
the
return
of
another
night
should
we
not
recover
the
horses
what
then
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
think
of
what
was
best
to
be
done
in
such
a
contingency
at
length
an
idea
suggested
itself
a
plan
so
feasible
that
i
could
not
help
communicating
it
to
who
like
myself
was
awake
the
plan
was
simple
enough
and
i
only
wondered
i
had
not
thought
of
it
sooner
it
was
that
he
should
proceed
to
bringiers
procure
other
horses
or
a
carriage
there
and
at
an
early
hour
of
the
following
night
meet
us
on
the
levee
road
what
could
be
better
than
this
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
his
obtaining
the
horses
at
bringiers
the
carriage
more
likely
was
not
known
at
least
no
one
would
suspect
his
having
any
relations
with
me
i
was
satisfied
that
the
disappearance
of
the
quadroon
would
be
at
once
attributed
to
me
gayarre
himself
would
know
that
and
therefore
i
alone
would
be
suspected
and
sought
after
agreed
with
me
that
this
would
be
the
very
plan
to
proceed
upon
in
case
our
horses
could
not
be
found
and
having
settled
the
details
we
awaited
with
less
apprehension
for
the
approach
of
day
day
broke
at
length
the
grey
light
slowly
struggled
through
the
shadowy
until
it
became
clear
enough
to
enable
us
to
renew
the
search
aurore
remained
upon
the
ground
while
and
i
taking
different
directions
set
out
after
the
horses
went
farther
into
the
woods
while
i
took
the
opposite
route
i
soon
arrived
at
the
zigzag
fence
bounding
the
fields
of
gayarre
for
we
were
still
upon
the
very
borders
of
his
plantation
on
reaching
this
i
turned
along
its
edge
and
kept
on
for
the
point
where
the
entered
the
woods
it
was
by
this
we
had
come
in
on
the
previous
night
and
i
thought
it
probable
the
horses
might
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
stray
back
the
same
way
i
was
right
in
my
conjecture
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
embouchure
of
the
road
i
espied
the
of
both
animals
going
out
towards
the
river
i
saw
also
those
we
had
made
on
the
previous
night
coming
in
i
compared
them
the
tracks
leading
both
ways
were
made
by
the
same
horses
one
had
a
broken
shoe
which
enabled
me
at
a
glance
to
tell
they
were
the
same
i
noted
another
sign
upon
the
trail
i
noted
that
our
horses
in
passing
out
dragged
their
bridles
with
branches
adhering
to
them
this
confirmed
the
original
supposition
that
they
had
broken
loose
it
was
now
a
question
of
how
far
they
had
gone
should
i
follow
and
endeavour
to
overtake
them
it
was
now
bright
daylight
and
the
risk
would
be
great
long
before
this
gayarre
and
his
friends
would
be
up
and
on
the
alert
no
doubt
parties
were
already
traversing
the
levee
road
as
well
as
the
among
the
plantations
at
every
step
i
might
expect
to
meet
either
a
scout
or
a
pursuer
the
tracks
of
the
horses
showed
they
had
been
travelling
rapidly
and
straight
onward
they
had
not
stopped
to
browse
likely
they
had
gone
direct
to
the
levee
road
and
turned
back
to
the
city
they
were
livery
horses
and
no
doubt
knew
the
road
well
besides
they
were
of
the
mexican
breed
mustangs
with
these
lively
animals
the
trick
of
returning
over
a
day
journey
without
their
riders
is
not
uncommon
to
attempt
to
overtake
them
seemed
hopeless
as
well
as
perilous
and
i
at
once
gave
up
the
idea
and
turned
back
into
the
woods
as
i
approached
the
pawpaw
thicket
i
walked
with
lighter
tread
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
the
reason
foul
thoughts
were
in
my
heart
the
murmur
of
voices
fell
upon
my
ear
by
heaven
has
again
got
back
before
me
i
struggled
for
some
moments
with
my
honour
it
gave
way
and
i
made
my
further
approach
among
the
pawpaws
with
the
silence
of
a
thief
and
she
in
close
and
friendly
converse
they
stand
fronting
each
other
their
faces
almost
meet
their
attitudes
betoken
a
mutual
interest
they
talk
in
an
earnest
tone
in
the
low
murmuring
of
lovers
o
god
at
this
moment
the
scene
on
the
flashed
on
my
recollection
i
remembered
the
youth
wore
a
cloak
and
that
he
was
of
low
stature
it
was
he
who
was
standing
before
me
that
puzzle
was
explained
i
was
but
a
waif
a
foil
a
thing
for
a
coquette
to
play
with
there
stood
the
lover
of
aurore
i
stopped
like
one
stricken
the
sharp
aching
of
my
heart
oh
i
may
never
describe
it
felt
as
if
a
poisoned
arrow
had
pierced
to
its
very
core
and
there
remained
fixed
and
rankling
i
felt
faint
and
sick
i
could
have
fallen
to
the
ground
she
has
taken
something
from
her
bosom
she
is
handing
it
to
him
a
a
no
i
am
in
error
it
is
the
parchment
the
paper
taken
from
the
desk
of
the
avocat
what
does
it
mean
what
mystery
is
this
oh
i
shall
demand
a
full
explanation
from
both
of
you
i
shall
patience
heart
patience
has
taken
the
papers
and
hidden
them
under
his
cloak
he
turns
away
his
face
is
now
towards
me
his
eyes
are
upon
me
i
am
seen
ho
monsieur
he
inquired
advancing
to
meet
me
what
success
you
have
seen
nothing
of
the
horses
i
made
an
effort
to
speak
calmly
their
tracks
i
replied
even
in
this
short
phrase
my
voice
was
quivering
with
emotion
he
might
easily
have
noticed
my
agitation
and
yet
he
did
not
seem
to
do
so
only
their
tracks
monsieur
whither
did
they
lead
to
the
levee
road
no
doubt
they
have
returned
towards
the
city
we
need
have
no
farther
dependence
on
them
then
i
shall
go
to
bringiers
at
once
this
was
put
hypothetically
the
proposal
gave
me
pleasure
i
wished
him
away
i
wished
to
be
alone
with
aurore
it
would
be
as
well
i
assented
if
you
do
not
deem
it
too
early
oh
no
besides
i
have
business
in
bringiers
that
will
occupy
me
all
the
day
ah
doubt
not
my
return
to
meet
you
i
am
certain
to
procure
either
horses
or
a
carriage
after
twilight
you
will
find
me
at
the
end
of
the
fear
not
monsieur
i
have
a
strong
presentiment
that
for
you
all
will
yet
be
well
for
ah
a
deep
sigh
escaped
him
as
he
uttered
the
last
phrase
what
did
it
mean
was
he
mocking
me
had
this
strange
youth
a
secret
beyond
secret
did
he
that
aurore
loved
was
he
so
confident
so
sure
of
her
heart
that
he
recked
not
thus
leaving
her
alone
with
me
was
he
playing
with
me
as
the
tiger
with
its
victim
were
playing
with
me
these
horrid
thoughts
crowding
up
prevented
me
from
making
a
definite
rejoinder
to
his
remarks
i
muttered
something
about
hope
but
he
seemed
hardly
to
heed
my
remark
for
some
reason
he
was
evidently
desirous
of
being
gone
and
bidding
aurore
and
myself
adieu
he
turned
abruptly
off
and
with
quick
light
steps
threaded
his
way
through
the
woods
with
my
eyes
i
followed
his
retreating
form
until
it
was
hidden
by
the
intervening
branches
i
felt
relief
that
he
was
gone
i
could
have
wished
that
he
was
gone
for
ever
despite
the
need
we
had
of
his
assistance
despite
the
absolute
necessity
for
his
return
at
that
moment
i
could
have
wished
that
we
should
never
see
him
again

for

with

now
to
give
vent
to
the
dire
passion
of
jealousy
to
relieve
my
heart
with
recriminations
with
the
vengeance
of
reproach
i
could
stifle
the
foul
emotion
no
longer
no
longer
conceal
it
it
must
have
expression
in
words
i
had
purposely
remained
standing
with
my
face
averted
from
her
till
was
gone
out
of
sight
longer
too
i
was
endeavouring
to
still
the
wild
throbbings
of
my
breast
to
affect
the
calmness
of
indifference
vain
hypocrisy
to
her
eyes
my
spite
must
have
been
patent
for
in
this
the
keen
instincts
of
woman
are
not
to
be
baffled
it
was
even
so
she
comprehended
all
hence
the
wild
act
the
to
which
at
that
moment
she
gave
way
i
was
turning
to
carry
out
my
design
when
i
felt
the
soft
pressure
of
her
body
against
mine
her
arms
encircled
my
neck
her
head
with
face
upturned
rested
upon
my
bosom
and
her
large
lustrous
eyes
sought
mine
with
a
look
of
melting
inquiry
that
look
should
have
satisfied
me
surely
no
eyes
but
the
eyes
of
love
could
have
borne
such
expression
and
yet
i
was
not
content

even
this
did
not
still
my
suspicious
thoughts
the
circumstances
had
been
too
strong
jealousy
had
taken
too
firm
a
hold
to
be
plucked
out
by
mere
assurances
explanation
alone
could
satisfy
me
that
or
confession
having
made
a
commencement
i
went
on
i
detailed
what
i
had
seen
at
the
landing
the
after
conduct
of
what
i
had
observed
the
preceding
night
what
i
had
just
that
moment
witnessed
i
detailed
all
i
added
no
reproaches
there
was
time
enough
for
them
when
i
should
receive
her
answer
it
came
in
the
midst
of
tears
she
had
known
before
that
was
acknowledged
there
a
mystery
in
the
relations
that
existed
between
them
i
was
solicited
not
to
require
an
explanation
my
patience
was
appealed
to
it
was
not
her
secret
i
should
soon
know
all
in
due
time
all
would
be
revealed
how
readily
my
heart
yielded
to
these
delicious
words
i
no
longer
doubted
how
could
i
with
those
large
eyes
full
of
shining
through
the
lashes
my
heart
yielded
once
more
my
arms
closed
affectionately
around
the
form
of
my
betrothed
and
a
fervent
kiss
renewed
the
vow
of
our
betrothal
we
could
have
remained
long
upon
this
spot
but
prudence
prompted
us
to
leave
it
we
were
too
near
to
the
point
of
danger
at
the
distance
of
two
hundred
yards
was
the
fence
that
separated
plantation
from
the
wild
woods
and
from
that
could
even
be
seen
the
house
itself
far
off
over
the
fields
the
thicket
concealed
this
it
was
true
but
should
pursuit
lead
that
way
the
thicket
would
be
the
first
place
that
would
be
searched
it
would
be
necessary
to
seek
a
farther
off
in
the
woods
i
bethought
me
of
the
flowery
glade
the
scene
of
my
adventure
with
the
around
it
the
underwood
was
thick
and
shady
and
there
were
spots
where
we
could
remain
screened
from
the
observation
of
the
keenest
eyes
at
that
moment
i
thought
only
of
such
concealment
it
never
entered
my
head
that
there
were
means
of
discovering
us
even
in
the
heart
of
the
tangled
thicket
or
the
pathless
maze
of
the
i
resolved
therefore
to
make
at
once
for
the
glade
the
pawpaw
thicket
where
we
had
passed
the
night
lay
near
the
angle
of
gayarre
plantation
to
reach
the
glade
it
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
pass
a
mile
or
more
to
the
northward
by
taking
a
diagonal
line
through
the
woods
the
chances
were
ten
to
one
we
should
lose
our
way
and
perhaps
not
find
a
proper
place
of
concealment
the
chances
were
too
that
we
might
not
find
a
path
through
the
network
of
swamps
and
bayous
that
traversed
the
forest
in
every
direction
i
resolved
therefore
to
skirt
the
plantation
until
i
had
reached
the
path
that
i
had
before
followed
to
the
glade
and
which
i
now
remembered
there
would
be
some
risk
until
we
had
got
to
the
northward
of
gayarre
plantation
but
we
should
keep
at
a
distance
from
the
fence
and
as
much
as
possible
in
the
underwood
fortunately
a
belt
of
palmetto
land
marking
the
limits
of
the
annual
inundation
extended
northward
through
the
woods
and
parallel
to
the
line
of
fence
this
singular
vegetation
with
its
broad
fronds
formed
an
excellent
cover
and
a
person
passing
through
it
with
caution
could
not
be
observed
from
any
great
distance
the
partial
of
its
leaves
was
rendered
more
complete
by
the
tall
of
the
and
other
malvaceous
plants
that
shared
the
ground
with
the
palmettos
directing
ourselves
within
the
selvage
of
this
rank
vegetation
we
advanced
with
caution
and
soon
came
opposite
the
place
where
we
had
crossed
the
fence
on
the
preceding
night
at
this
point
the
woods
approached
nearest
to
the
house
of
gayarre
as
already
stated
but
one
field
lay
between
but
it
was
nearly
a
mile
in
length
it
was
dead
level
however
and
did
not
appear
half
so
long
by
going
forward
to
the
fence
we
could
have
seen
the
house
at
the
opposite
end
and
very
distinctly
i
had
no
intention
of
gratifying
my
curiosity
at
that
moment
by
such
an
act
and
was
moving
on
when
a
sound
fell
upon
my
ear
that
caused
me
suddenly
to
halt
while
a
thrill
of
terror
ran
through
my
veins
my
companion
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
looked
inquiringly
in
my
face
a
caution
to
her
to
be
silent
was
all
the
reply
i
could
make
and
leaning
a
little
lower
so
as
to
bring
my
ear
nearer
to
the
ground
i
listened
the
suspense
was
short
i
heard
the
sound
again
my
first
conjecture
was
right
it
was
the
growl
of
a
hound
there
was
no
mistaking
that
prolonged
and
note
i
was
too
fond
a
disciple
of
saint
hubert
not
to
recognise
the
bay
of
a
molossian
though
distant
and
low
like
the
hum
of
a
forest
bee
i
was
not
deceived
in
the
sound
it
fell
upon
my
ears
with
a
terrible
import
and
why
terrible
was
the
baying
of
a
hound
to
me
above
all
others
whose
ears
attuned
to
the
tally
ho
and
the
view
hilloa
regarded
these
sounds
as
the
sweetest
of
music
why
terrible
ah
you
must
think
of
the
circumstances
in
which
i
was
placed
you
must
think
too
of
the
hours
i
spent
with
the
of
the
tales
he
told
me
in
that
dark
the
stories
of
runaways
of
of
and
practices
long
thought
to
be
confined
to
cuba
but
which
i
found
as
rife
upon
the
soil
of
louisiana
you
must
think
of
all
these
and
then
you
will
understand
why
i
trembled
at
the
distant
baying
of
a
hound
the
howl
i
heard
was
still
very
distant
it
came
from
the
direction
of
gayarre
house
it
broke
forth
at
intervals
it
was
not
like
the
utterance
of
a
hound
upon
the
trail
but
that
of
dogs
just
cleared
from
the
kennel
and
giving
tongue
to
their
joy
at
the
prospect
of
sport
fearful
apprehensions
were
stirred
within
me
at
the
moment
a
terrible
conjecture
rushed
across
my
brain
were
after
us
with
chapter
seventy
hounds
on
our
trail
o
god
after
us
with
hounds
either
after
us
or
about
to
be
was
the
hypothetic
form
of
my
conjecture
i
could
proceed
no
farther
upon
our
path
till
i
had
become
satisfied
leaving
aurore
among
the
palmettoes
i
ran
directly
forward
to
the
fence
which
was
also
the
boundary
of
the
woods
on
reaching
this
i
grasped
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
swung
myself
up
to
such
an
elevation
as
would
enable
me
to
see
over
the
tops
of
the
cane
this
gave
me
a
full
view
of
the
house
shining
under
the
sun
that
had
now
risen
in
all
his
splendour
at
a
glance
i
saw
that
i
had
guessed
aright
distant
as
the
house
was
i
could
plainly
see
men
around
it
many
of
them
on
horseback
their
heads
were
moving
above
the
canes
and
now
and
then
the
deep
bay
of
hounds
told
that
several
dogs
were
loose
about
the
enclosure
the
scene
was
just
as
if
a
party
of
hunters
had
assembled
before
going
out
upon
a
deer
drive
and
but
for
the
place
the
time
and
the
circumstances
that
had
already
transpired
i
might
have
taken
it
for
such
far
different
however
was
the
impression
it
made
upon
me
i
knew
well
why
was
that
gathering
around
the
house
of
gayarre
i
knew
well
the
game
they
were
about
to
pursue
i
lingered
but
a
moment
upon
my
perch
long
enough
to
perceive
that
the
were
all
mounted
and
ready
to
start
with
pulse
i
retraced
my
steps
and
soon
rejoined
my
companion
who
stood
awaiting
me
with
trembling
apprehension
i
did
not
need
to
tell
her
the
result
of
my
reconnoissance
she
read
it
in
my
looks
she
too
had
heard
the
baying
of
the
dogs
she
was
a
native
and
knew
the
customs
of
the
land
she
knew
that
hounds
were
used
to
hunt
deer
and
foxes
and
of
the
woods
but
she
knew
also
that
on
many
plantations
there
were
some
kept
for
a
far
different
purpose
to
the
hunting
of
had
she
been
of
slow
comprehension
i
might
have
attempted
to
conceal
from
her
what
i
had
learnt
but
she
was
far
from
that
and
with
quick
instinct
she
divined
all
our
first
feeling
was
that
of
utter
hopelessness
there
seemed
no
chance
of
our
escaping
go
where
we
would
hounds
trained
to
the
scent
of
a
human
track
could
not
fail
to
follow
and
find
us
it
would
be
of
no
use
hiding
in
the
swamp
or
the
bush
the
tallest
sedge
or
the
thickest
underwood
could
not
give
us
shelter
from
pursuers
like
these
our
first
feeling
then
was
that
of
hopelessness
quickly
followed
by
a
resolve
to
go
no
farther
to
stand
our
ground
and
be
taken
we
had
not
death
to
fear
though
i
knew
that
if
taken
i
might
make
up
my
mind
to
some
rough
handling
i
knew
the
feeling
that
was
abroad
in
relation
to
the
abolitionists
at
that
time
raging
like
a
fever
i
had
heard
of
the
barbarous
treatment
which
some
of
these
fanatics
as
they
were
called
had
experienced
at
the
hands
of
the
incensed
i
should
no
doubt
be
reckoned
in
the
same
category
or
maybe
still
worse
be
charged
as
a
in
any
case
i
had
to
fear
chastisement
and
of
no
light
kind
either
but
my
dread
of
this
was
nothing
when
compared
with
the
reflection
that
if
taken
must
go
back
to
it
was
this
thought
more
than
any
other
that
made
my
pulse
beat
quickly
it
was
this
thought
that
determined
me
not
to
surrender
until
after
every
effort
to
escape
should
fail
us
i
stood
for
some
moments
pondering
on
what
course
to
pursue
all
at
once
a
thought
came
into
my
mind
that
saved
me
from
despair
that
thought
was
of
gabriel
the
runaway
do
not
imagine
that
i
had
forgotten
him
or
his
all
this
time
do
not
fancy
i
had
not
thought
of
him
before
often
since
we
had
entered
the
woods
had
he
and
his
arisen
in
my
memory
and
i
should
have
gone
there
for
concealment
but
that
the
distance
deterred
me
as
we
intended
to
return
to
the
levee
road
after
sunset
i
had
chosen
the
glade
for
our
on
account
of
its
being
nearer
even
then
when
i
learnt
that
hounds
would
be
after
us
i
had
again
thought
of
making
for
the
bambarra
but
had
dismissed
the
idea
because
it
occurred
to
me
that
hounds
could
follow
us
and
that
by
taking
shelter
with
the
runaway
we
should
only
guide
his
tyrants
upon
so
quick
and
confused
had
been
all
these
reflections
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
hounds
not
trail
us
across
it
was
only
at
that
moment
when
pondering
how
i
could
throw
them
off
the
track
thinking
of
the
and
his
that
i
remembered
the
water
sure
enough
in
that
still
lay
a
hope
and
i
could
now
appreciate
the
remarkable
cunning
with
which
the
lair
of
the
runaway
had
been
chosen
it
was
just
the
place
to
seek
refuge
from
de
dam
the
moment
i
thought
of
it
i
resolved
to
flee
thither
i
would
be
sure
to
know
the
way
i
had
taken
especial
pains
to
remember
it
for
even
on
the
day
of
my
some
thoughts
something
more
like
a
presentiment
than
a
plan
had
passed
through
my
mind
vaguely
pointing
to
a
contingency
like
the
present
later
events
and
particularly
my
design
of
escaping
to
the
city
at
once
had
driven
these
thoughts
out
of
my
mind
for
all
that
i
still
remembered
the
way
by
which
the
bambarra
had
guided
me
and
could
follow
it
with
hurried
steps
though
there
was
neither
road
nor
path
save
the
devious
tracks
made
by
cattle
or
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
but
i
was
certain
i
knew
it
well
i
should
remember
the
signs
and
blazes
to
which
the
guide
had
called
my
attention
i
should
remember
where
it
crossed
the
big
bayou
by
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
that
served
as
a
i
should
remember
where
it
ran
through
a
strip
of
marsh
impassable
for
horses
through
the
among
the
great
knees
and
buttocks
of
the
cypresses
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
that
huge
tree
with
its
prostrate
trunk
projecting
out
into
the
lake
and
its
branches
that
cunning
harbour
for
the
little
pirogue
i
should
be
sure
to
remember
neither
had
i
forgotten
the
signal
by
which
i
was
to
warn
the
runaway
whenever
i
should
return
it
was
a
peculiar
whistle
he
had
instructed
me
to
give
and
also
the
number
of
times
i
was
to
utter
it
i
had
not
waited
for
all
these
reflections
many
of
them
were
that
occurred
along
the
way
the
moment
i
remembered
the
lake
i
resolved
upon
my
course
and
with
a
word
of
cheer
to
my
companion
we
again
moved
forward
chapter
seventy
one
the
signal
the
change
in
our
plans
made
no
change
in
the
direction
we
continued
on
in
the
same
course
the
way
to
the
lake
passed
by
the
glade
where
we
had
purposed
going
indeed
through
the
middle
of
it
lay
the
nearest
path
to
the
lair
of
the
runaway
not
far
from
the
angle
of
gayarre
plantation
was
the
spot
where
i
had
parted
with
the
black
on
the
night
of
my
adventure
with
him
it
was
at
this
point
the
path
entered
the
woods
the
blaze
upon
a
which
i
remembered
well
showed
me
the
direction
i
was
but
too
glad
to
turn
off
here
and
leave
the
open
woods
the
more
so
that
just
as
we
had
reached
the
the
cry
of
the
hounds
came
swelling
upon
the
air
loud
and
prolonged
from
the
direction
of
the
sound
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
were
already
in
the
and
lifting
our
trail
of
the
preceding
night
for
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
the
timber
was
thin
the
axe
had
been
flourished
there
as
the
numerous
stumps
testified
it
was
there
the
firewood
was
procured
for
the
use
of
the
plantation
and
cords
of
it
already
cut
and
piled
could
be
seen
on
both
sides
of
our
path
we
passed
among
these
with
trembling
haste
we
feared
to
meet
with
some
of
the
woodcutters
or
the
driver
of
a
such
an
encounter
would
have
been
a
great
misfortune
as
whoever
might
have
seen
us
would
have
guided
our
pursuers
on
the
track
had
i
reasoned
calmly
i
would
not
have
felt
uneasiness
on
this
head
i
might
have
known
that
if
the
dogs
succeeded
in
tracking
us
thus
far
they
would
need
no
direction
from
either
wagoner
or
but
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
i
did
not
think
of
this
and
i
felt
relief
when
we
had
passed
through
the
tract
of
broken
woods
and
were
entering
under
the
more
sombre
shadow
of
the
virgin
forest
it
was
now
a
question
of
time
a
question
of
whether
we
should
be
able
to
reach
the
lake
summon
the
bambarra
with
his
pirogue
and
be
paddled
out
of
sight
before
the
dogs
should
trail
us
to
the
edge
of
the
water
should
we
succeed
in
doing
so
we
should
then
have
a
fair
prospect
of
escape
no
doubt
the
dogs
would
guide
our
pursuers
to
the
place
of
our
embarkation
the
fallen
tree
but
then
both
dogs
and
men
would
be
at
fault
that
gloomy
lake
of
the
woods
was
a
rare
labyrinth
though
the
open
water
was
a
surface
of
small
extent
neither
it
nor
the
motte
of
timber
in
its
centre
was
visible
from
the
place
of
embarkation
and
besides
the
lake
itself
the
inundation
covered
a
large
tract
of
the
forest
even
should
our
pursuers
be
certain
that
we
had
escaped
by
the
water
they
might
despair
of
finding
us
in
the
midst
of
such
a
maze
where
the
atmosphere
at
that
season
of
fall
foliage
had
the
hue
of
a
dark
twilight
but
they
would
hardly
be
convinced
of
our
escape
in
that
way
there
was
no
trace
left
where
the
pirogue
was
moored
no
mark
upon
the
tree
they
would
scarce
suspect
the
existence
of
a
canoe
in
such
an
spot
where
the
water
a
mere
stagnant
pond
had
no
communication
either
with
the
river
or
the
adjacent
bayous
we
were
leaving
no
tracks
i
took
care
of
that
that
could
be
perceived
under
the
forest
gloom
and
our
pursuers
might
possibly
conclude
that
the
dogs
had
been
running
upon
the
trail
of
a
bear
a
cougar
or
the
swamp
all
of
which
animals
freely
take
the
water
when
pursued
with
such
probabilities
i
was
cheering
myself
and
my
companion
as
we
kept
rapidly
along
our
course
my
greatest
source
of
apprehension
was
the
delay
we
should
have
to
make
after
giving
the
signal
to
the
runaway
would
he
hear
it
at
once
would
he
attend
to
it
in
due
haste
would
he
arrive
in
time
these
were
the
points
about
which
i
felt
chiefly
anxious
time
was
the
important
consideration
in
that
lay
the
conditions
of
our
danger
oh
that
i
had
thought
of
this
purpose
before
oh
that
we
had
started
earlier
how
long
would
it
take
our
pursuers
to
come
up
i
could
scarce
trust
myself
to
think
of
a
reply
to
this
question
mounted
as
they
were
they
would
travel
faster
than
we
the
dogs
would
guide
them
at
a
run
one
thought
alone
gave
me
hope
they
would
soon
find
our
of
the
night
they
would
see
where
we
had
slept
by
the
and
the
moss
they
could
not
fail
to
be
certain
of
all
that
but
would
they
so
easily
trail
us
thence
in
our
search
after
the
horses
we
had
tracked
the
woods
in
all
directions
i
had
gone
back
to
the
and
some
distance
along
it
all
this
would
surely
baffle
the
dogs
for
a
while
besides
at
starting
had
left
the
pawpaw
thicket
by
a
different
route
from
that
we
had
taken
they
might
go
off
on
trail
would
that
they
might
follow
all
these
conjectures
passed
rapidly
through
my
mind
as
we
hurried
along
i
even
thought
of
making
an
attempt
to
throw
the
hounds
off
the
scent
i
thought
of
the
practised
by
the
bambarra
with
the
spray
of
the
loblolly
pine
but
unfortunately
i
could
not
see
any
of
these
trees
on
our
way
and
feared
to
lose
time
by
going
in
search
of
one
i
had
doubts
too
of
the
efficacy
of
such
a
proceeding
though
the
black
had
solemnly
assured
me
of
it
the
common
red
onion
he
had
afterwards
told
me
would
be
equally
effective
for
the
like
purpose
but
the
red
onion
grew
not
in
the
woods
and
the
de
i
could
not
find
for
all
that
i
did
not
proceed
without
precautions
youth
though
i
was
i
was
an
old
hunter
and
had
some
knowledge
of
woodcraft
gathered
in
deerstalking
and
in
the
pursuit
of
other
game
among
my
native
hills
moreover
my
nine
months
of
life
had
not
all
been
passed
within
city
walls
and
i
had
already
become
initiated
into
many
of
the
mysteries
of
the
great
american
forest
i
did
not
proceed
then
in
mere
reckless
haste
where
precautions
could
be
observed
i
adopted
them
a
strip
of
marsh
had
to
be
crossed
it
was
stagnant
water
out
of
which
grew
flags
and
the
shrub
called
de
it
was
and
could
he
waded
i
knew
this
for
i
had
crossed
it
before
hand
in
hand
we
waded
through
and
got
safe
to
the
opposite
side
but
on
entering
i
took
pains
to
choose
a
place
where
we
stepped
at
once
from
the
dry
ground
into
the
water
on
going
out
i
observed
a
like
precaution
so
that
our
tracks
might
not
appear
in
the
mud
perhaps
i
should
not
have
taken
all
this
trouble
had
i
known
that
there
were
hunters
among
those
who
pursued
us
i
fancied
the
crowd
i
had
seen
were
but
planters
or
people
of
the
town
hurriedly
brought
together
by
gayarre
and
his
friends
i
fancied
they
might
not
have
much
skill
in
tracking
and
that
my
simple
trick
might
be
sufficient
to
mislead
them
had
i
known
that
at
their
head
was
a
man
of
whom
gabriel
had
told
me
much
a
man
made
his
and
who
was
the
most
noted
tracker
in
all
the
country
i
might
have
saved
myself
both
the
time
and
the
trouble
i
was
taking
but
i
knew
not
that
this
ruffian
and
his
trained
dogs
were
after
us
and
i
did
my
utmost
to
throw
my
pursuers
off
shortly
after
passing
the
marsh
we
crossed
the
big
bayou
by
means
of
its
oh
that
i
could
have
destroyed
that
log
or
hurled
it
from
its
position
i
consoled
myself
with
the
idea
that
though
the
dogs
might
follow
us
over
it
it
would
delay
the
pursuers
awhile
who
no
doubt
were
all
on
horseback
we
now
passed
through
the
glade
but
i
halted
not
there
we
stopped
not
to
look
upon
its
bright
flowers
we
perceived
not
their
fragrance
once
i
had
wished
to
share
this
lovely
scene
in
the
company
of
aurore
we
were
now
in
its
midst
but
under
what
circumstances
what
wild
thoughts
were
passing
through
my
brain
as
we
hurried
across
this
flowery
tract
under
bright
sunshine
and
then
plunged
once
more
into
the
sombre
atmosphere
of
the
woods
the
path
i
remembered
well
and
was
able
to
pursue
it
without
hesitancy
now
and
then
only
did
i
pause
partly
to
listen
and
partly
to
rest
my
companion
whose
bosom
heaved
quick
and
high
with
the
rude
exertion
but
her
glance
testified
that
her
courage
was
firm
and
her
smile
cheered
on
at
length
we
entered
among
the
that
bordered
the
lake
and
gliding
around
their
massive
trunks
soon
reached
the
edge
of
the
water
we
approached
the
fallen
tree
and
climbing
up
advanced
along
its
trunk
until
we
stood
among
its
branches
i
had
provided
myself
with
an
instrument
a
simple
joint
of
the
cane
which
grew
plenteously
around
and
which
with
my
knife
i
had
shaped
after
a
fashion
i
had
been
already
taught
by
the
bambarra
with
this
i
could
produce
a
sound
that
would
be
heard
at
a
great
distance
off
and
plainly
to
the
remotest
part
of
the
lake
taking
hold
of
the
branches
i
now
bent
down
until
my
face
almost
touched
the
surface
of
the
water
and
placing
the
reed
to
my
lips
i
gave
utterance
to
the
signal
chapter
seventy
two
the
the
shrill
whistle
pealing
along
the
water
pierced
the
dark
aisles
of
the
forest
it
aroused
the
wild
denizens
of
the
lake
who
startled
by
such
an
unusual
sound
answered
it
with
their
various
cries
in
a
screaming
concert
the
screech
of
the
crane
and
the
louisiana
heron
the
hoarse
hooting
of
owls
and
the
hoarser
croak
of
the
pelican
mingled
together
and
louder
than
all
the
scream
of
the
osprey
and
the
voice
of
the
bald
eagle
the
last
falling
upon
the
ear
with
sharp
metallic
repetitions
that
exactly
resembled
the
filing
of
saws
for
some
moments
this
commotion
was
kept
up
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
had
to
repeat
the
signal
then
it
would
not
have
been
heard
shrill
as
it
was
it
could
scarce
have
been
distinguished
in
such
a
din
crouching
among
the
branches
we
remained
to
await
the
result
we
made
no
attempts
at
idle
converse
the
moments
were
too
perilous
for
aught
but
feelings
of
extreme
anxiety
now
and
then
a
word
of
cheer
a
muttered
hope
were
all
the
communications
that
passed
between
us
with
earnest
looks
we
watched
the
water
with
glances
of
fear
we
regarded
the
land
on
one
side
we
listened
for
the
plashing
of
a
paddle
on
the
other
we
dreaded
to
hear
the
howl
of
a
hound
never
can
i
forget
those
moments
those
moments
till
death
i
may
not
forget
them
every
thought
at
the
time
every
incident
however
minute
now
rushes
into
my
remembrance
as
if
it
were
a
thing
of
yesterday
i
remember
that
once
or
twice
away
under
the
trees
we
perceived
a
ripple
along
the
surface
of
the
water
our
hearts
were
full
of
hope
we
thought
it
was
the
canoe
it
was
a
fleeting
joy
the
waves
were
made
by
the
great
saurian
whose
hideous
body
large
almost
as
the
pirogue
itself
next
moment
passed
before
our
eyes
cleaving
the
water
with
velocity
i
remember
entertaining
the
supposition
that
the
runaway
not
be
in
his
he
might
be
off
in
the
forest
in
search
of
food
or
on
any
other
errand
then
the
reflection
followed
if
such
were
the
case
i
should
have
found
the
pirogue
by
the
tree
still
he
might
have
other
around
the
lake
on
the
other
side
perhaps
he
had
not
told
me
whether
or
no
and
it
was
probable
enough
these
hypothetic
conjectures
increased
my
anxiety
but
there
arose
another
far
more
dreadful
because
far
more
probable
black
might
be
far
more
probable
because
night
was
his
day
and
day
his
night
at
night
he
was
abroad
roaming
and
busy
by
day
he
was
at
home
and
slept
oh
heavens
if
he
should
be
asleep
and
not
have
heard
the
signal
such
was
the
terrible
fancy
that
rushed
across
my
brain
i
felt
suddenly
impelled
to
repeat
the
signal
though
i
thought
at
the
time
if
my
conjecture
were
correct
there
was
but
little
hope
he
would
hear
me
a
negro
sleeps
like
a
torpid
bear
the
report
of
a
gun
or
a
alone
could
awake
one
there
was
no
chance
for
a
puny
pipe
like
mine
the
more
especially
as
the
screaming
concert
still
continued
even
if
he
should
hear
it
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
distinguish
the
whistle
from
merciful
heavens
i
was
speaking
to
my
companion
when
this
exclamation
interrupted
me
it
came
from
my
own
lips
but
with
involuntary
utterance
it
was
called
forth
by
a
sound
of
dread
import
a
sound
that
i
could
hear
above
the
shrill
screaming
of
the
birds
and
hearing
could
interpret
it
was
the
baying
of
a
hound
i
stood
bent
and
listening
i
heard
it
again
there
was
no
mistaking
that
note
i
had
the
ears
of
a
hunter
i
knew
the
music
well
oh
how
unlike
to
music
then
it
fell
upon
my
ears
like
a
cry
of
vengeance
like
a
knell
of
death
i
thought
no
longer
of
repeating
the
signal
even
if
heard
it
would
be
too
late
i
flung
the
reed
away
as
a
useless
toy
i
drew
aurore
along
the
tree
passing
her
behind
me
and
raising
myself
erect
stood
fronting
the
land
again
the
gowl
broke
out
its
loud
echoes
rolling
through
the
woods
this
time
so
near
that
every
moment
i
expected
to
see
the
animal
that
had
uttered
it
i
had
not
long
to
wait
a
hundred
yards
off
was
a
i
could
perceive
a
motion
among
the
tall
reeds
their
tops
swayed
to
and
fro
and
their
hollow
culms
rattled
against
each
other
as
they
were
jerked
about
and
borne
downward
some
living
thing
was
pressing
through
their
midst
the
motion
reached
their
verge
the
last
canes
gave
way
and
i
now
saw
what
i
had
looked
for
the
spotted
body
of
a
hound
with
a
spring
the
animal
came
forth
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
open
ground
and
then
uttering
a
prolonged
howl
took
up
the
scent
and
galloped
forward
close
upon
his
heels
came
a
second
the
waving
cane
closed
behind
them
and
both
ran
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
log
as
there
was
no
longer
any
underwood
i
had
a
full
view
of
their
bodies
gloomy
as
the
place
was
i
could
see
them
with
sufficient
distinctness
to
note
their
kind
huge
gaunt
black
and
tan
from
the
manner
of
their
approach
they
had
evidently
been
trained
to
their
work
and
that
was
the
hunting
of
deer
no
ordinary
hound
would
have
run
upon
a
human
track
as
they
were
running
upon
ours
the
moment
i
saw
these
dogs
i
made
ready
for
a
conflict
their
huge
size
their
broad
heavy
jaws
and
ferocious
looks
told
what
savage
brutes
they
were
and
i
felt
satisfied
they
would
attack
me
as
soon
as
they
came
up
with
this
belief
i
drew
forth
a
pistol
and
laying
hold
of
a
branch
to
steady
me
i
stood
waiting
their
approach
i
had
not
miscalculated
on
reaching
the
prostrate
trunk
he
scarcely
made
a
pause
but
leaping
upward
came
running
along
the
log
he
had
dropped
the
scent
and
now
advanced
with
eyes
glaring
evidently
meditating
to
spring
upon
me
my
position
could
not
have
been
better
had
i
spent
an
hour
in
choosing
it
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
my
assailant
could
neither
dodge
to
the
right
nor
the
left
but
was
compelled
to
approach
me
in
a
line
as
straight
as
an
arrow
i
had
nought
to
do
but
hold
my
weapon
firm
and
properly
directed
a
novice
with
could
hardly
have
missed
such
an
object
my
nerves
were
strung
with
anger
a
feeling
of
intense
indignation
was
burning
in
my
breast
that
rendered
me
as
firm
as
steel
i
was
cool
from
very
passion
at
the
thought
of
being
thus
hunted
like
a
wolf
i
waited
until
the
muzzle
of
the
hound
almost
met
that
of
the
pistol
and
then
i
fired
the
dog
tumbled
from
the
log
i
saw
the
other
close
upon
his
heels
i
aimed
through
the
smoke
and
again
pulled
trigger
the
good
weapon
did
not
fail
me
again
the
report
was
followed
by
a
plunge
the
hounds
were
no
longer
upon
the
log
they
had
fallen
right
and
left
into
the
black
water
below
chapter
seventy
three
the
the
hounds
had
fallen
into
the
water
one
dead
the
other
badly
wounded
the
latter
could
not
have
escaped
as
one
of
his
legs
had
been
struck
by
the
bullet
and
his
efforts
to
swim
were
but
the
throes
of
desperation
in
a
few
minutes
he
must
have
gone
to
the
bottom
but
it
was
not
his
fate
to
die
by
drowning
it
was
predestined
that
his
howling
should
be
brought
to
a
termination
in
a
far
different
manner
the
voice
of
the
dog
is
music
to
the
ear
of
the
alligator
of
all
other
animals
this
is
the
favourite
prey
of
the
great
saurian
and
the
howl
of
hound
or
cur
will
attract
him
from
any
distance
where
it
may
be
heard
naturalists
have
endeavoured
to
explain
this
in
a
different
way
they
say
and
such
is
the
fact
that
the
howling
of
a
dog
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
voice
of
the
young
alligator
and
that
the
old
ones
are
attracted
towards
the
spot
where
it
is
heard
the
mother
to
protect
it
and
the
male
parent
to
devour
it
this
is
a
disputed
point
in
natural
history
but
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
the
alligator
eagerly
preys
upon
the
dog
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
seizing
the
canine
victim
in
his
terrible
jaws
and
carrying
it
off
to
his
aqueous
retreat
this
he
does
with
an
air
of
such
earnest
avidity
as
to
leave
no
doubt
but
that
he
esteems
the
dog
a
favourite
morsel
i
was
not
surprised
then
to
see
of
these
gigantic
reptiles
emerging
from
amid
the
dark
and
hastily
swimming
towards
the
wounded
hound
the
continued
howling
of
the
latter
guided
them
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
had
surrounded
the
spot
where
he
struggled
and
were
dashing
forward
upon
their
victim
a
shoal
of
sharks
could
not
have
finished
him
more
expeditiously
a
blow
from
the
tail
of
one
silenced
his
howling
three
or
four
pair
of
gaunt
jaws
closed
upon
him
at
the
same
time
a
short
scuffle
ensued
then
the
long
bony
heads
separated
and
the
huge
reptiles
were
seen
swimming
off
again
each
with
a
morsel
in
his
teeth
a
few
bubbles
and
blotches
of
red
froth
mottling
the
inky
surface
of
the
water
were
all
that
remained
where
the
hound
had
lately
been
plunging
almost
a
similar
scene
occurred
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
log
for
the
water
was
but
a
few
feet
in
depth
and
the
dead
hound
was
visible
as
he
lay
at
the
bottom
several
of
the
reptiles
approaching
on
that
side
had
seen
this
one
at
the
same
time
and
rushing
forward
they
served
him
precisely
as
his
companion
had
been
served
by
the
others
a
crumb
of
bread
could
not
have
disappeared
sooner
among
a
shoal
of
hungry
minnows
than
did
the
brace
of
down
the
throats
of
these
ravenous
reptiles
singular
as
was
the
incident
it
had
scarce
drawn
my
notice
i
had
far
other
things
to
think
of
after
firing
the
pistol
i
remained
standing
upon
the
tree
with
my
eyes
fixed
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
hounds
i
gazed
intently
among
the
away
up
the
dark
vistas
of
the
forest
i
watched
the
to
note
the
slightest
motion
in
the
reeds
i
listened
to
every
sound
while
i
stood
silent
myself
and
enjoined
silence
upon
my
trembling
companion
i
had
but
little
hope
then
there
would
be
more
dogs
no
doubt
slower
hounds
following
in
the
distance
and
with
them
the
mounted
they
could
not
be
far
behind
they
could
not
fail
to
come
up
soon
the
sooner
that
the
report
of
my
pistol
would
guide
them
to
the
spot
it
would
be
of
no
use
making
opposition
to
a
crowd
of
angry
men
i
could
do
nothing
else
than
surrender
to
them
my
companion
entreated
me
to
this
course
abjured
me
not
to
use
my
weapons
for
i
now
held
the
second
pistol
in
my
hand
but
i
had
no
intention
of
using
them
should
the
crowd
of
men
come
up
i
had
only
taken
out
the
pistol
as
a
precaution
against
the
attack
of
the
dogs
should
any
more
appear
for
a
good
while
i
heard
no
sounds
from
the
forest
and
saw
no
signs
of
our
pursuers
what
could
be
detaining
them
perhaps
the
crossing
of
the
bayou
or
the
tract
of
marsh
i
knew
the
horsemen
must
there
leave
the
trail
but
were
they
all
mounted
i
began
to
hope
that
gabriel
might
yet
be
in
time
if
he
had
not
heard
the
he
must
have
heard
the
reports
of
my
pistol
but
on
second
thoughts
that
might
only
keep
him
back
he
would
not
understand
the
firing
and
might
fear
to
come
with
the
pirogue
perhaps
he
had
heard
the
first
signal
and
was
now
on
his
way
it
was
not
too
late
to
entertain
such
a
supposition
notwithstanding
what
had
passed
we
had
been
yet
but
a
short
while
upon
the
spot
if
on
the
way
he
might
think
the
shots
were
fired
from
my
gun
fired
at
some
game
he
might
not
be
deterred
there
was
still
a
hope
he
might
come
in
time
if
so
we
would
be
able
to
reach
his
in
safety
there
was
no
trace
of
the
dogs
save
a
blotch
or
two
of
blood
upon
the
rough
bark
of
the
log
and
that
was
not
visible
from
the
shore
unless
there
were
other
dogs
to
guide
them
to
the
spot
the
men
might
not
in
the
darkness
so
easily
discover
these
marks
we
might
yet
baffle
them
with
fresh
hope
i
turned
once
more
towards
the
water
and
gazed
in
the
direction
in
which
i
expected
the
pirogue
to
come
alas
there
was
no
sign
of
it
no
sound
came
from
the
lake
save
the
wild
calling
of
the
affrighted
birds
i
turned
once
more
to
the
land
i
saw
the
in
motion
the
tall
culms
vibrated
and
crackled
under
the
heavy
tread
of
a
man
who
the
next
moment
emerging
into
the
open
ground
advanced
at
a
slinging
trot
towards
the
water
he
was
alone
and
afoot
there
were
no
dogs
with
him
but
the
long
rifle
poised
upon
his
shoulder
and
the
hunting
accoutrements
around
his
body
told
me
at
a
glance
he
was
the
owner
of
the
his
black
bushy
beard
his
leggings
and
buckskin
shirt
his
red
neckcloth
and
raccoon
cap
but
above
all
the
brutal
ferocity
of
his
visage
left
me
in
no
doubt
as
to
who
this
character
was
the
description
of
the
runaway
answered
him
in
every
particular
he
could
be
no
other
than
the
chapter
seventy
four
shot
for
shot
yes
the
individual
who
now
advanced
was
ruffin
the
and
the
dogs
i
had
killed
were
his
a
brace
of
in
the
settlement
as
being
specially
trained
to
tracking
the
unfortunate
blacks
that
driven
by
cruel
treatment
had
taken
to
the
woods
too
was
their
master
a
dissipated
brutal
fellow
half
hunter
half
who
dwelt
in
the
woods
like
an
indian
savage
and
hired
himself
out
to
such
of
the
planters
as
needed
the
aid
of
him
and
his
horrid
hounds
as
i
have
said
i
had
never
seen
this
individual
though
i
had
heard
of
him
often
from
scipio
from
the
boy
caton
and
lastly
from
gabriel
the
bambarra
had
described
him
minutely
had
told
me
wild
stories
of
the
man
wickedness
and
ferocious
cruelty
how
he
had
taken
the
lives
of
several
runaways
while
in
pursuit
of
them
and
caused
others
to
be
torn
and
mangled
by
his
savage
dogs
he
was
the
terror
and
aversion
of
every
negro
quarter
along
the
coast
and
his
name
appropriate
to
his
character
oft
served
the
sable
mother
as
a
bogey
to
frighten
her
squalling
piccaninny
into
silence
such
was
ruffin
the
as
he
was
known
among
the
black
helots
of
the
plantations
the
and
the
red
cowhide
were
not
half
so
terrible
as
he
in
comparison
with
him
such
characters
as
bully
bill
the
flogging
overseer
might
be
esteemed
mild
and
humane
the
sight
of
this
man
at
once
deprived
me
of
all
farther
thought
of
escape
i
permitted
my
pistol
arm
to
drop
loosely
by
my
side
and
stood
awaiting
his
advance
with
the
intention
of
surrendering
ourselves
up
resistance
would
be
vain
and
could
only
lead
to
the
idle
spilling
of
blood
with
this
intention
i
remained
silent
having
cautioned
my
companion
to
do
the
same
on
first
emerging
from
the
the
hunter
did
not
see
us
i
was
partially
screened
by
the
moss
where
i
stood
aurore
entirely
so
besides
the
man
eyes
were
not
turned
in
our
direction
they
were
bent
upon
the
ground
no
doubt
he
had
heard
the
reports
of
my
pistol
but
he
trusted
more
to
his
tracking
instincts
and
from
his
bent
attitude
i
could
tell
that
he
was
trailing
his
own
dogs
almost
as
one
of
themselves
would
have
done
as
he
neared
the
edge
of
the
pond
the
of
the
water
reached
him
and
suddenly
halting
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
forward
the
sight
of
the
pond
seemed
to
puzzle
him
and
his
astonishment
was
expressed
in
the
short
sharp
expression
hell
the
next
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
prostrate
tree
then
quickly
swept
along
its
trunk
and
rested
full
upon
me
hell
and
scissors
he
exclaimed
thar
are
ye
whar
my
dogs
i
stood
eyeing
him
back
but
made
no
reply
you
hear
damn
yer
whar
my
dogs
i
still
remained
silent
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
log
he
saw
the
upon
the
hark
he
remembered
the
shots
hell
and
damn
cried
he
with
horrid
emphasis
you
kilt
my
dogs
and
then
followed
a
volley
of
mingled
oaths
and
threats
while
the
ruffian
gesticulated
as
if
he
had
suddenly
gone
mad
after
a
while
he
ceased
from
these
idle
demonstrations
and
planting
himself
firmly
he
raised
his
rifle
muzzle
towards
me
and
cried
out
come
off
that
log
and
fetch
your
with
you
quick
damn
yer
come
off
that
log
another
minnit
an
i
plug
ye
i
have
said
that
at
first
sight
of
the
man
i
had
given
up
all
idea
of
resistance
and
intended
to
surrender
at
once
but
there
was
something
so
arrogant
in
the
demand
so
insulting
in
the
tone
with
which
the
ruffian
made
it
that
it
fired
my
very
flesh
with
indignation
and
determined
me
to
stand
at
bay
anger
at
being
thus
hunted
both
my
heart
and
my
arm
the
brute
had
bayed
me
and
i
resolved
to
risk
resistance
another
reason
for
changing
my
determination
i
now
saw
that
he
was
he
had
followed
the
dogs
afoot
while
the
others
on
horseback
had
no
doubt
been
stopped
or
delayed
by
the
bayou
and
morass
had
the
crowd
come
up
i
must
have
yielded
but
the
himself
formidable
antagonist
though
he
appeared
was
still
but
and
to
surrender
tamely
to
a
single
individual
was
more
than
my
spirit
inherited
from
border
ancestry
could
brook
there
was
too
much
of
the
blood
in
my
veins
for
that
and
i
resolved
que
to
risk
the
encounter
my
pistol
was
once
more
firmly
grasped
and
looking
the
ruffian
full
into
his
bloodshot
eyes
i
shouted
back
fire
at
your
peril
miss
and
you
are
mine
the
sight
of
my
uplifted
pistol
caused
him
to
quail
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
had
opportunity
offered
he
would
have
withdrawn
from
the
contest
he
had
expected
no
such
a
reception
but
he
had
gone
too
far
to
recede
his
rifle
was
already
at
his
shoulder
and
the
next
moment
i
saw
the
flash
and
heard
the
sharp
crack
the
thud
of
his
bullet
too
fell
upon
my
ear
as
it
struck
into
the
branch
against
which
i
was
leaning
good
marksman
as
he
was
reputed
the
sheen
of
my
pistols
had
spoiled
his
aim
and
he
had
missed
me
i
did
not
miss
he
fell
to
the
shot
with
a
demoniac
howl
and
as
the
smoke
thinned
off
i
could
see
him
writhing
and
scrambling
in
the
black
mud
i
hesitated
whether
to
give
him
the
second
barrel
for
i
was
angry
and
desired
his
life
but
at
this
moment
noises
reached
me
from
behind
i
heard
the
plunging
paddle
with
the
sounds
of
a
manly
voice
and
turning
i
beheld
the
bambarra
the
latter
had
shot
the
pirogue
among
the
close
to
where
we
stood
and
with
voice
and
gesture
now
urged
us
to
get
aboard
quick
mass
quick
gal
jump
into
de
dugout
jump
in
truss
ole
gabe
he
stand
by
young
mass
to
de
deff
almost
mechanically
i
yielded
to
the
solicitations
of
the
runaway
though
i
now
saw
but
little
chance
of
our
ultimate
escape
and
having
assisted
aurore
into
the
pirogue
i
followed
and
took
my
seat
beside
her
the
strong
arm
of
the
negro
soon
impelled
us
far
out
from
the
shore
and
in
five
minutes
after
we
were
crossing
the
open
lake
toward
the
cypress
clump
in
its
midst
chapter
seventy
five
love
in
the
hour
of
peril
we
glided
into
the
shadow
of
the
tree
and
passed
under
its
trailing
parasites
the
pirogue
touched
its
trunk
mechanically
i
climbed
along
the
sloping
buttress
mechanically
assisted
aurore
we
stood
within
the
hollow
chamber
the
of
the
runaway
and
for
the
present
were
safe
from
pursuit
but
there
was
no
joy
in
our
hearts
we
knew
it
was
but
a
respite
without
any
hope
of
ultimate
concealment
the
encounter
with
ruffin
had
ruined
all
our
prospects
whether
the
hunter
were
yet
dead
or
alive
his
presence
would
guide
the
pursuit
the
way
we
had
got
off
would
easily
be
conjectured
and
our
could
not
long
remain
undiscovered
what
had
passed
would
be
likely
to
aggravate
our
pursuers
and
strengthen
their
determination
to
capture
us
before
ruffin
came
up
there
was
yet
a
chance
of
safety
most
of
those
engaged
in
the
pursuit
would
regard
it
as
the
mere
ordinary
affair
of
a
chase
after
a
runaway
negro
a
sport
of
which
they
might
get
tired
whenever
they
should
lose
the
track
considering
for
whom
the
hunt
was
got
up
a
man
so
unpopular
as
gayarre
none
would
have
any
great
interest
in
the
result
excepting
himself
and
his
ruffian
aids
had
we
left
no
traces
where
we
embarked
in
the
pirogue
the
gloomy
labyrinth
of
water
might
have
discouraged
our
pursuers
most
of
whom
would
have
given
up
at
the
doubtful
prospect
and
returned
to
their
homes
we
might
have
been
left
undisturbed
until
nightfall
and
it
was
my
design
to
have
then
recrossed
the
lake
landed
at
some
new
point
and
under
the
guidance
of
the
bambarra
get
back
to
the
levee
road
where
we
were
to
meet
with
the
horses
thence
as
originally
agreed
upon
to
the
city
all
this
programme
i
had
hastily
conceived
and
previous
to
the
appearance
of
ruffin
there
was
every
probability
i
should
succeed
in
carrying
it
out
even
after
i
had
shot
the
dogs
i
did
not
wholly
despair
there
were
still
many
chances
of
success
that
occurred
to
me
the
pursuers
thought
i
detained
by
the
bayou
might
have
lost
the
dogs
and
would
not
follow
their
track
so
easily
some
time
would
be
wasted
at
all
events
even
should
they
form
a
correct
guess
as
to
the
fate
of
the
hounds
neither
men
afoot
nor
on
horseback
could
penetrate
to
our
they
would
need
boats
or
canoes
more
time
would
be
consumed
in
bringing
these
from
the
river
and
perhaps
night
would
be
down
before
this
could
be
effected
on
night
and
i
still
had
confidence
that
was
previous
to
the
conflict
with
the
after
that
affair
circumstances
had
undergone
a
change
alive
or
dead
ruffin
would
guide
the
pursuit
to
where
we
were
if
still
living
and
now
that
my
angry
feeling
had
passed
away
i
hoped
he
was
he
would
at
once
direct
the
pursuers
upon
us
i
believed
he
was
not
dead
only
wounded
his
behaviour
after
receiving
the
shot
had
not
been
like
that
of
a
man
mortally
wounded
i
believed
and
hoped
that
he
still
lived
not
that
i
felt
at
all
remorseful
at
what
had
happened
but
from
mere
prudential
considerations
if
dead
his
body
by
the
prostrate
tree
would
soon
be
discovered
and
would
tell
the
tale
to
those
who
came
up
we
should
be
captured
all
the
same
and
might
expect
the
more
terrible
consequences
the
rencontre
with
this
ruffian
had
been
altogether
unfortunate
it
had
changed
the
face
of
affairs
blood
had
been
spilt
defence
of
a
the
news
would
return
rapidly
to
the
town
it
would
spread
through
the
plantations
with
the
whole
community
would
be
fired
and
roused
the
number
of
our
pursuers
quadrupled
i
should
be
hunted
as
a
outlaw
and
with
the
hostile
energy
of
vengeance
i
knew
all
this
and
no
longer
speculated
upon
the
probabilities
of
deliverance
there
was
not
the
remotest
prospect
of
our
being
able
to
get
away
i
drew
my
betrothed
near
me
i
folded
her
in
my
arms
and
pressed
her
to
my
heart
till
death
she
would
be
mine
she
swore
it
in
that
shadowy
spot
in
that
dread
and
darksome
hour
till
death
she
would
be
mine
her
love
inspired
me
with
courage
and
with
courage
i
awaited
the
result
another
hour
passed
despite
our
fearful
anticipations
that
hour
was
pleasantly
spent
strange
it
is
to
say
so
but
it
was
in
reality
one
of
the
happiest
hours
i
can
remember
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
enabled
to
hold
free
converse
with
aurore
since
the
day
of
our
betrothal
we
were
now
alone
for
the
faithful
black
stood
sentinel
below
by
the
hawser
of
his
pirogue
the
reaction
consequent
upon
my
late
jealousy
had
kindled
my
love
to
a
renewed
and
fiercer
life
for
such
is
the
law
of
nature
in
the
very
ardour
of
my
affection
i
almost
forgot
our
desperate
situation
over
and
over
again
we
vowed
eternal
troth
over
and
over
plighted
our
mutual
faith
in
fond
burning
words
the
eloquence
of
our
heartfelt
passion
oh
it
was
a
happy
hour
alas
it
came
to
an
end
it
ended
with
a
painful
regret
but
not
with
surprise
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
horns
sounding
through
the
woods
and
signal
shouts
answering
each
other
in
different
directions
i
was
not
surprised
when
voices
came
pealing
across
the
water
loud
oaths
and
ejaculations
mingled
with
the
plashing
of
paddles
and
the
plunging
of
oars
and
when
the
negro
announced
that
several
boats
filled
with
armed
men
were
in
the
open
water
and
approaching
the
tree
it
did
not
take
me
by
surprise
i
had
foreseen
all
this
i
descended
to
the
base
of
the
cypress
and
stooping
down
looked
out
under
the
hanging
moss
i
could
see
the
surface
of
the
lake
i
could
see
the
men
in
their
canoes
and
skiffs
rowing
and
gesticulating
when
near
the
middle
of
the
open
water
they
lay
upon
their
oars
and
held
a
short
consultation
after
a
moment
they
separated
and
rowed
in
circles
around
evidently
with
the
design
of
encompassing
the
tree
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
executed
this
manoeuvre
and
now
closed
in
until
their
vessels
floated
among
the
drooping
branches
of
the
cypress
a
shout
of
triumph
told
that
they
had
discovered
our
retreat
and
i
now
saw
their
faces
peering
through
the
curtain
of
straggling
they
could
see
the
pirogue
and
both
the
negro
and
myself
standing
by
the
bow
surrender
shouted
a
voice
in
a
loud
firm
tone
if
you
resist
your
lives
be
on
your
own
heads
notwithstanding
this
summons
the
boats
did
not
advance
any
nearer
they
knew
that
i
carried
pistols
and
that
i
knew
how
to
handle
them
the
proofs
were
fresh
they
approached
therefore
with
caution
thinking
i
might
still
use
my
weapons
they
had
no
need
to
be
apprehensive
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
so
resistance
against
twenty
men
for
there
were
that
number
in
the
boats
twenty
men
well
armed
would
have
been
a
piece
of
desperate
folly
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
though
if
i
had
i
believe
the
bambarra
would
have
stood
by
me
to
the
death
the
brave
fellow
steeled
to
a
supernatural
courage
by
the
prospect
of
his
punishment
had
even
proposed
fight
but
his
courage
was
madness
and
i
entreated
him
not
to
resist
as
they
would
certainly
have
slain
him
on
the
spot
i
meant
no
resistance
but
i
hesitated
a
moment
in
making
answer
we
all
armed
continued
the
speaker
who
seemed
to
have
some
authority
over
the
others
it
is
useless
for
you
to
resist
you
had
better
give
up
damn
them
cried
another
and
a
rougher
voice
do
waste
talk
on
them
let
fire
the
tree
and
smoke
out
that
moss
burn
i
reckon
i
recognised
the
voice
that
uttered
this
inhuman
suggestion
it
came
from
bully
bill
i
have
no
intention
of
making
resistance
i
called
out
in
reply
to
the
first
speaker
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
i
have
committed
no
crime
for
what
i
have
done
i
am
ready
to
answer
to
the
laws
you
shall
answer
to
replied
one
who
had
not
before
spoken
are
the
laws
here
there
was
an
ambiguity
in
this
speech
that
i
liked
not
but
there
was
no
further
parley
the
skiffs
and
canoes
had
suddenly
closed
in
around
the
tree
a
dozen
muzzles
of
pistols
and
rifles
were
pointed
at
me
and
a
dozen
voices
commanded
the
negro
and
myself
to
get
into
one
of
the
boats
from
the
fierce
determined
glances
of
these
rough
men
i
saw
it
was
death
or
obedience
i
turned
to
bid
adieu
to
aurore
who
had
rushed
out
of
the
and
stood
near
me
weeping
as
i
faced
round
several
men
sprang
upon
the
buttress
and
seizing
me
from
behind
held
me
in
their
united
grasp
then
drawing
my
arms
across
my
back
tied
them
fast
with
a
rope
i
could
just
speak
one
parting
word
with
aurore
who
no
longer
in
tears
stood
regarding
my
captors
with
a
look
of
scornful
indignation
as
they
led
me
unresistingly
into
the
boat
her
high
spirit
gave
way
to
words
and
she
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
scorn
cowards
cowards
not
one
of
you
dare
meet
him
in
a
fair
field
no
not
one
of
you
the
lofty
spirit
of
my
betrothed
echoed
mine
and
gave
me
proof
of
her
love
i
was
pleased
with
it
and
could
have
applauded
but
my
mortified
captors
gave
me
no
time
to
reply
for
the
next
moment
the
pirogue
in
which
i
had
been
placed
shot
out
through
the
branches
and
floated
on
the
open
water
of
the
lake
chapter
seventy
six
a
terrible
fate
i
saw
no
more
of
aurore
neither
was
the
black
brought
along
i
could
gather
from
the
conversation
of
my
captors
that
they
were
to
be
taken
in
one
of
the
skiffs
that
had
stayed
behind
that
they
were
to
be
landed
at
a
different
point
from
that
to
which
we
were
steering
i
could
gather
too
that
the
poor
bambarra
was
doomed
to
a
terrible
punishment
the
same
he
already
dreaded
the
losing
of
an
arm
i
was
pained
at
such
a
thought
but
still
more
by
the
rude
jests
i
had
now
to
listen
to
my
betrothed
and
myself
were
reviled
with
a
disgusting
coarseness
which
i
can
not
repeat
i
made
no
attempt
to
defend
either
her
or
myself
i
did
not
even
reply
i
sat
with
my
eyes
bent
gloomily
upon
the
water
and
it
was
a
sort
of
relict
to
me
when
the
pirogue
again
passed
in
among
the
trunks
of
the
and
their
dark
shadow
half
concealed
my
face
from
the
view
of
my
captors
i
was
brought
back
to
the
landing
by
the
old
on
nearing
this
i
saw
that
a
crowd
of
men
awaited
us
on
the
shore
and
among
them
i
recognised
the
ferocious
ruffin
with
his
arm
slung
in
his
red
kerchief
bandaged
and
bloody
he
was
standing
up
with
the
rest
thank
heaven
i
have
not
killed
him
was
my
mental
ejaculation
so
much
the
less
have
i
to
answer
for
the
canoes
and
skiffs
with
the
exception
of
that
which
carried
aurore
and
the
black
had
all
arrived
at
this
point
and
my
captors
were
landing
in
all
there
were
some
thirty
or
forty
men
with
a
proportion
of
boys
most
of
them
were
armed
with
either
pistols
or
rifles
under
the
grey
gloom
of
the
trees
they
presented
a
picturesque
tableau
but
at
that
moment
my
feelings
were
not
attuned
to
enjoy
it
i
was
landed
among
the
rest
and
with
two
armed
men
one
before
and
another
immediately
at
my
back
i
was
marched
off
through
the
woods
the
crowd
accompanied
us
some
in
the
advance
some
behind
while
others
walked
alongside
these
were
the
boys
and
the
more
brutal
of
the
men
who
occasionally
taunted
me
with
rude
speech
i
might
have
lost
patience
and
grown
angry
had
that
served
me
but
i
knew
it
would
only
give
pleasure
to
my
tormentors
without
bettering
my
condition
i
therefore
observed
silence
and
kept
my
eyes
averted
or
turned
upon
the
ground
we
passed
on
rapidly
as
fast
as
the
crowd
could
make
way
through
the
bushes
and
i
was
glad
of
this
i
presumed
i
was
about
to
be
conducted
before
a
magistrate
or
justice
of
the
peace
as
there
called
well
thought
i
under
legal
authority
and
in
the
keeping
of
the
officers
i
should
be
protected
from
the
gibes
and
insults
that
were
being
showered
upon
me
everything
short
of
personal
violence
was
offered
and
there
were
some
that
seemed
sufficiently
disposed
even
for
this
i
saw
the
forest
opening
in
front
i
supposed
we
had
gone
by
some
shorter
way
to
the
clearings
it
was
not
so
for
the
next
moment
we
emerged
into
the
glade
again
the
glade
here
my
captors
came
to
a
halt
and
now
in
the
open
light
i
had
an
opportunity
to
know
who
they
were
at
a
glance
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
hands
of
a
desperate
crowd
gayarre
himself
was
in
their
midst
and
beside
him
his
own
overseer
and
the
and
the
brutal
larkin
with
these
were
some
of
the
poorer
class
of
weavers
of
cottonade
or
small
planters
the
rest
of
the
mob
was
composed
of
the
very
scum
of
the
settlement
the
drunken
boatmen
whom
i
had
used
to
see
gossiping
in
front
of
the
groceries
and
other
dissipated
rowdies
of
the
place
not
one
respectable
planter
appeared
upon
the
ground
not
one
respectable
man
for
what
had
they
stopped
in
the
glade
i
was
impatient
to
be
taken
before
the
justice
and
chafed
at
the
delay
why
am
i
detained
here
i
asked
in
a
tone
of
anger
ho
mister
replied
one
do
be
in
such
a
hell
of
a
hurry
find
out
soon
enough
i
reckon
i
protest
against
this
i
continued
i
insist
upon
being
taken
before
the
justice
an
so
ye
will
damn
you
you
ai
got
far
to
go
justice
is
who
where
i
inquired
under
the
impression
that
a
magistrate
was
upon
the
ground
i
had
heard
of
acting
as
justices
of
the
peace
in
fact
had
met
with
one
or
two
of
them
and
among
the
rude
forms
that
surrounded
me
there
might
be
one
of
these
where
is
the
justice
i
demanded
oh
he
about
never
you
fear
replied
one
whar
the
justice
shouted
another
ay
whar
the
justice
whar
are
ye
judge
cried
a
third
as
if
appealing
to
some
one
in
the
crowd
come
on
hyar
judge
he
added
come
along
hyar
a
fellar
wants
to
see
you
i
really
thought
the
man
was
in
earnest
i
really
believed
there
was
such
an
individual
in
the
mob
the
only
impression
made
upon
me
was
astonishment
at
this
rudeness
towards
the
magisterial
representative
of
the
law
my
misconception
was
for
at
this
moment
ruffin
the
bandaged
and
bloody
ruffin
came
close
up
to
me
and
after
scowling
upon
me
with
his
fierce
bloodshot
eyes
bent
forward
until
his
lips
almost
touched
my
face
and
then
hissed
out
perhaps
mister
you
niver
heerd
ov
a
thrill
of
horror
run
through
my
veins
the
fearful
conviction
flashed
before
my
mind
that
were
to
lynch
chapter
seventy
seven
the
sentence
of
judge
lynch
an
undefined
suspicion
of
something
of
this
sort
had
already
crossed
my
thoughts
i
remembered
the
reply
made
from
the
boats
you
shall
answer
to
are
the
law
i
had
heard
some
mysterious
innuendoes
as
we
passed
through
the
woods
i
had
noticed
too
that
on
our
arrival
in
the
glade
we
found
those
who
had
gone
in
the
advance
halted
there
as
if
waiting
for
the
others
to
come
up
and
i
could
not
comprehend
why
we
had
stopped
there
at
all
i
now
saw
that
the
men
of
the
party
were
drawing
to
one
side
and
forming
a
sort
of
irregular
ring
with
that
peculiar
air
of
solemnity
that
bespeaks
some
serious
business
it
was
only
the
boys
and
some
negroes
for
these
too
had
taken
part
in
our
capture
who
remained
near
me
ruffin
had
simply
approached
to
gratify
his
revengeful
feelings
by
tantalising
me
all
these
appearances
had
aroused
wild
suspicions
within
me
but
up
to
that
moment
they
had
assumed
no
definite
form
i
had
even
endeavoured
to
keep
back
such
a
suspicion
under
the
vague
belief
that
by
the
very
imagination
of
it
i
might
in
some
way
aid
in
bringing
it
about
it
was
no
longer
suspicion
it
was
now
conviction
they
were
going
to
lynch
me
the
significant
interrogatory
on
account
of
the
manner
in
which
it
was
put
was
hailed
by
the
boys
with
a
shout
of
laughter
ruffin
continued
no
i
guess
you
ha
heerd
ov
that
ar
justice
since
yur
a
stranger
in
these
parts
an
a
britisher
you
ha
got
sich
a
one
among
yur
bigwigs
i
reckin
he
the
fellar
that
ai
to
keep
you
long
in
chancery
no
by
god
he
do
yur
business
in
time
hell
and
scissors
yu
see
if
he
do
throughout
all
this
speech
the
brutal
fellow
taunted
me
with
gestures
as
well
as
words
drawing
from
his
auditory
repeated
bursts
of
laughter
so
provoked
was
i
that
had
i
not
been
fast
bound
i
should
have
sprung
upon
him
but
bound
as
i
was
and
vulgar
brute
as
was
this
adversary
i
could
not
hold
my
tongue
were
i
free
you
ruffian
you
would
not
dare
taunt
me
thus
at
all
events
have
come
off
but
second
best
i
crippled
for
life
though
it
do
matter
much
seeing
what
a
clumsy
use
you
make
of
a
rifle
this
speech
produced
a
terrible
effect
upon
the
brute
the
more
so
that
the
boys
now
laughed
at
these
boys
were
not
all
bad
they
were
incensed
against
me
as
an
abolitionist
or
as
they
phrased
it
and
under
the
countenance
and
guidance
of
their
elders
their
worst
passions
were
now
at
play
but
for
all
that
they
were
not
essentially
wicked
they
were
rough
backwoods
boys
and
the
spirit
of
my
retort
pleased
them
after
that
they
held
back
from
jeering
me
not
so
with
ruffin
who
now
broke
forth
into
a
string
of
vindictive
oaths
and
menaces
and
appeared
as
if
about
to
grapple
me
with
his
one
remaining
hand
at
this
moment
he
was
called
off
by
the
men
who
needed
him
in
the
caucus
and
after
shaking
his
fist
in
my
face
and
uttering
a
parting
imprecation
he
left
me
i
was
for
some
minutes
kept
in
suspense
i
could
not
tell
what
this
dread
council
were
debating
or
what
they
meant
to
do
with
me
though
i
now
felt
quite
certain
that
they
did
not
intend
taking
me
before
any
magistrate
from
frequent
phrases
that
reached
my
ears
such
as
flog
the
scoundrel
tar
and
feathers
i
began
to
conjecture
that
some
such
punishment
awaited
me
to
my
astonishment
however
i
found
upon
listening
a
while
that
a
number
of
my
judges
were
actually
opposed
to
these
punishments
as
being
too
mild
some
declared
openly
that
but
my
life
could
satisfy
the
outraged
the
took
this
view
of
the
case
and
it
was
to
add
to
their
strength
that
ruffin
had
been
summoned
a
feeling
of
terrible
fear
crept
over
me
say
rather
a
feeling
of
horror
but
it
was
only
complete
when
the
ring
of
men
suddenly
broke
up
and
i
saw
two
of
their
number
lay
hold
of
a
rope
and
commence
reeving
it
over
the
limb
of
a
that
stood
by
the
edge
of
the
glade
there
had
been
a
trial
and
a
sentence
too
even
judge
lynch
has
his
formality
when
the
rope
was
adjusted
one
of
the
men
the
it
was
approached
me
and
in
a
sort
of
rude
paraphrase
of
a
judge
summed
up
and
pronounced
the
sentence
i
had
outraged
the
laws
i
had
committed
two
capital
crimes
i
had
stolen
slaves
and
endeavoured
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
a
jury
of
twelve
men
had
tried
and
found
me
guilty
and
sentenced
me
to
death
by
hanging
even
this
was
not
permitted
to
go
forth
in
an
informal
manner
the
very
phraseology
was
adopted
i
was
to
be
hung
by
the
neck
until
i
should
be
dead
dead
you
will
deem
this
relation
exaggerated
and
improbable
you
will
think
that
i
am
sporting
with
you
you
will
not
believe
that
such
lawlessness
can
exist
in
a
christian
a
civilised
land
you
will
fancy
that
these
men
were
sporting
with
and
that
in
the
end
they
did
not
seriously
intend
to
i
can
not
help
it
if
you
think
so
but
i
solemnly
declare
that
such
was
their
design
and
i
felt
as
certain
at
that
moment
that
they
intended
to
have
hanged
me
as
i
now
feel
that
i
was
not
hanged
believe
it
or
not
you
must
remember
that
i
would
not
have
been
the
first
victim
by
many
and
that
thought
was
vividly
before
my
mind
at
the
time
along
with
it
there
was
the
rope
there
the
tree
there
stood
my
judges
before
me
their
looks
alone
might
have
produced
conviction
there
was
not
a
ray
of
mercy
to
be
seen
at
that
awful
moment
i
knew
not
what
i
said
or
how
i
acted
i
remember
only
that
my
fears
were
somewhat
modified
by
my
indignation
that
i
protested
menaced
swore
that
my
ruthless
judges
answered
me
with
mockery
they
were
actually
proceeding
to
put
the
sentence
into
execution
and
had
already
carried
me
across
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
when
the
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
fell
upon
our
ears
and
the
next
moment
a
party
of
horsemen
galloped
into
the
glade
chapter
seventy
eight
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
at
sight
of
these
horsemen
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
for
among
the
foremost
i
beheld
the
calm
resolute
face
of
edward
reigart
behind
him
rode
the
sheriff
of
the
parish
followed
by
a
posse
of
about
a
dozen
men
among
whom
i
recognised
several
of
the
most
respectable
planters
of
the
neighbourhood
every
one
of
the
party
was
armed
either
with
a
rifle
or
pistols
and
the
manner
in
which
they
rode
forward
upon
the
ground
showed
that
they
had
come
in
great
haste
and
with
a
determined
purpose
i
say
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
an
actual
criminal
standing
upon
the
platform
of
the
gallows
could
not
have
been
more
joyed
at
sight
of
the
messenger
that
brought
him
reprieve
or
pardon
in
the
i
recognised
friends
in
their
countenances
i
read
rescue
i
was
not
displeased
therefore
when
the
sheriff
dismounting
advanced
to
my
side
and
placing
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
told
me
i
was
his
prisoner
in
the
name
of
the
law
though
brusquely
done
and
apparently
with
a
degree
of
rudeness
i
was
not
displeased
either
by
the
act
or
the
manner
the
latter
was
plainly
assumed
for
a
purpose
and
in
the
act
itself
i
hailed
the
salvation
of
my
life
i
felt
like
a
rescued
man
the
proceeding
did
not
equally
content
my
former
judges
who
loudly
murmured
their
dissatisfaction
they
alleged
that
i
had
already
been
tried
by
a
jury
of
free
that
i
had
been
found
guilty
of
that
i
had
stolen
that
i
had
resisted
when
pursued
and
had
wownded
one
of
my
pursuers
and
that
as
all
this
had
been
clarly
made
out
they
could
see
what
more
was
wanted
to
establish
my
guilt
and
that
i
ought
to
be
on
the
spot
without
further
loss
of
time
the
sheriff
replied
that
such
a
course
would
be
illegal
that
the
majesty
of
the
law
must
be
respected
that
if
i
was
guilty
of
the
crimes
alleged
against
me
the
law
would
most
certainly
measure
out
full
punishment
to
me
but
that
i
must
first
be
brought
before
a
justice
and
the
charge
legally
and
formally
made
out
and
finally
expressed
his
intention
to
take
me
before
justice
claiborne
the
magistrate
of
the
district
an
angry
altercation
ensued
between
the
mob
and
the
sheriffs
party
in
which
but
slight
show
of
respect
was
paid
to
the
high
executive
and
for
some
time
i
was
actually
in
dread
that
the
ruffians
would
carry
their
point
but
an
american
sheriff
is
entirely
a
different
sort
of
character
from
the
idle
gentleman
who
fills
that
office
in
an
english
county
the
former
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
man
of
proved
courage
and
action
and
sheriff
hickman
with
whom
my
judges
had
to
deal
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
his
posse
moreover
hurriedly
collected
by
my
friend
reigart
chanced
to
have
among
their
number
several
men
of
a
similar
stamp
reigart
himself
though
a
man
of
peace
was
to
possess
a
cool
and
determined
spirit
and
there
was
the
landlord
of
my
hotel
and
several
of
the
planters
who
accompanied
several
of
the
young
planters
behaved
in
a
handsome
manner
and
the
law
prevailed
yes
thank
heaven
and
noble
men
the
law
prevailed
else
i
should
never
have
gone
out
of
that
glade
alive
justice
lynch
had
to
give
way
to
justice
claiborne
and
a
respite
was
obtained
from
the
cruel
verdict
of
the
former
the
victorious
sheriff
and
his
party
bore
me
off
in
their
midst
but
though
my
ferocious
judges
had
yielded
for
the
present
it
was
not
certain
that
they
would
not
still
attempt
to
rescue
me
from
the
hands
of
the
law
to
prevent
this
the
sheriff
mounted
me
upon
a
horse
he
himself
riding
upon
one
side
while
an
assistant
of
tried
courage
took
the
opposite
reigart
and
the
planters
kept
close
to
me
before
and
behind
while
the
shouting
blaspheming
mob
followed
both
on
horseback
and
afoot
in
this
way
we
passed
through
the
woods
across
the
fields
along
the
road
leading
into
bringiers
and
then
to
the
residence
of
squire
claiborne
justice
of
the
peace
for
that
district
attached
to
his
dwelling
was
a
large
room
or
office
where
the
squire
was
used
to
administer
the
magisterial
law
of
the
land
it
was
entered
by
a
separate
door
from
the
house
itself
and
had
no
particular
marks
about
it
to
denote
that
it
was
a
hall
of
justice
beyond
the
fact
that
it
was
furnished
with
a
bench
or
two
to
serve
as
seats
and
a
small
desk
or
rostrum
in
one
corner
at
this
desk
the
squire
was
in
the
habit
of
settling
petty
disputes
administering
affidavits
at
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
each
and
arranging
other
small
civic
matters
but
oftener
was
his
magisterial
function
employed
in
sentencing
the
mutinous
darkie
to
his
due
the
sheriff
sterling
men
who
were
lovers
of
the
law
and
lovers
of
fair
play
as
well
and
those
armed
to
the
teeth
would
have
laid
down
their
lives
on
the
spot
in
defence
of
the
sheriff
and
his
demand
true
they
were
in
the
minority
in
point
of
numbers
but
they
had
the
law
upon
their
side
and
that
gave
them
strength
there
was
one
point
in
my
favour
above
all
others
and
that
was
my
accusers
chanced
to
be
unpopular
men
gayarre
as
already
stated
although
professing
a
high
standard
of
morality
was
not
esteemed
by
the
neighbouring
planters
particularly
by
those
of
american
origin
the
others
most
forward
against
me
were
known
to
be
secretly
instigated
by
the
lawyer
as
to
ruffin
whom
i
had
wounded
those
upon
the
ground
had
heard
the
crack
of
his
rifle
and
knew
that
had
fired
in
their
calmer
moments
my
resistance
would
have
been
deemed
perfectly
justifiable
so
far
as
that
individual
was
concerned
had
the
circumstances
been
different
had
the
two
niggers
i
had
belonged
to
a
popular
planter
and
not
to
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
had
ruffin
been
a
respectable
citizen
instead
of
the
dissipated
half
outlaw
that
he
was
had
there
not
been
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
many
present
that
it
was
a
case
of
ordinary
then
indeed
might
it
have
gone
ill
with
me
in
spite
of
the
sheriff
and
his
party
even
as
it
was
a
long
and
angry
altercation
ensued
loud
words
oaths
and
gestures
of
menace
were
freely
exchanged
and
both
rifles
and
pistols
were
cocked
and
firmly
grasped
before
the
discussion
ended
but
the
brave
sheriff
remained
resolute
reigart
acted
a
most
courageous
part
my
host
and
proportion
of
stripes
on
the
complaint
of
a
conscientious
master
for
after
all
such
theoretical
protection
does
the
poor
slave
enjoy
into
this
room
then
was
i
hurried
by
the
sheriff
and
his
assistants
the
mob
rushing
in
after
until
every
available
space
was
occupied
chapter
seventy
nine
the
crisis
no
doubt
a
messenger
had
preceded
us
for
we
found
squire
claiborne
in
his
chair
of
office
ready
to
hear
the
case
in
the
tall
thin
old
man
with
white
hair
and
dignified
aspect
i
recognised
a
fit
representative
of
justice
one
of
those
venerable
magistrates
who
command
respect
not
only
by
virtue
of
age
and
office
but
from
the
dignity
of
their
personal
character
in
spite
of
the
noisy
rabble
that
surrounded
me
i
read
in
the
serene
firm
look
of
the
magistrate
the
determination
to
show
fair
play
i
was
no
longer
uneasy
on
the
way
reigart
had
told
me
to
be
of
good
cheer
he
had
whispered
something
about
strange
developments
to
be
made
but
i
had
not
fully
heard
him
and
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
he
meant
in
the
hurry
and
crush
i
had
found
no
opportunity
for
an
explanation
keep
up
your
spirits
said
he
as
he
pushed
his
horse
alongside
me
do
have
any
fear
about
the
result
it
rather
an
odd
affair
and
will
have
an
odd
ending
rather
unexpected
for
somebody
i
should
say
ha
ha
ha
reigart
actually
laughed
aloud
and
appeared
to
be
in
high
glee
what
could
such
conduct
mean
i
was
not
permitted
to
know
for
at
that
moment
the
sheriff
in
a
high
tone
of
authority
commanded
that
no
one
should
hold
communication
with
the
prisoner
and
my
friend
and
i
were
abruptly
separated
strange
i
did
not
dislike
the
sheriff
for
this
i
had
a
secret
belief
that
his
manner
apparently
somewhat
hostile
to
me
was
assumed
for
a
purpose
the
mob
required
conciliation
and
all
this
was
a
bit
of
management
on
the
part
of
sheriff
hickman
on
arriving
before
justice
claiborne
it
required
all
the
authority
of
both
sheriff
and
justice
to
obtain
silence
a
partial
lull
however
enabled
the
latter
to
proceed
with
the
case
now
gentlemen
said
he
speaking
in
a
firm
magisterial
tone
i
am
ready
to
hear
the
charge
against
this
young
man
of
what
is
he
accused
colonel
hickman
inquired
the
justice
turning
to
the
sheriff
of
i
believe
replied
the
latter
who
prefers
the
charge
dominique
gayarre
replied
a
voice
from
the
crowd
which
i
recognised
as
that
of
gayarre
himself
is
monsieur
gayarre
present
inquired
the
justice
the
voice
again
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
the
face
of
the
avocat
now
presented
itself
in
front
of
the
rostrum
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
said
the
magistrate
recognising
him
what
is
the
charge
you
bring
against
the
prisoner
state
it
in
full
and
upon
oath
gayarre
having
gone
through
the
formula
of
the
oath
proceeded
with
his
plaint
in
true
lawyer
style
i
need
not
follow
the
circumlocution
of
legal
phraseology
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
were
several
counts
in
his
indictment
i
was
first
accused
of
having
endeavoured
to
instigate
to
mutiny
and
revolt
the
slaves
of
the
plantation
besancon
by
having
interfered
to
prevent
one
of
their
number
from
receiving
his
punishment
secondly
i
had
caused
another
of
these
to
strike
down
his
overseer
and
afterwards
had
induced
him
to
run
away
to
the
woods
and
aided
him
in
so
doing
this
was
the
slave
gabriel
who
had
just
that
day
been
captured
in
my
company
thirdly
and
gayarre
now
came
to
the
cream
of
his
accusation
thirdly
continued
he
i
accuse
this
person
of
having
entered
my
house
on
the
night
of
october
the
and
having
stolen
therefrom
the
female
slave
aurore
besancon
it
is
false
cried
a
voice
interrupting
him
it
is
false
is
a
gayarre
started
as
though
some
one
had
thrust
a
knife
into
him
who
says
that
he
demanded
though
with
a
voice
that
evidently
faltered
i
replied
the
voice
and
at
the
same
instant
a
young
man
leaped
upon
one
of
the
benches
and
stood
with
his
head
overtopping
the
crowd
it
was
i
say
it
he
repeated
in
the
same
firm
tone
besancon
is
no
slave
but
a
free
here
justice
claiborne
continued
do
me
the
favour
to
read
this
document
at
the
same
time
the
speaker
handed
a
folded
parchment
across
the
room
the
sheriff
passed
it
to
the
magistrate
who
opened
it
and
read
aloud
it
proved
to
be
the
free
papers
of
aurore
the
quadroon
the
certificate
of
her
manumission
regularly
signed
and
attested
by
her
master
auguste
besancon
and
left
by
him
in
his
will
the
astonishment
was
extreme
so
much
so
that
the
crowd
seemed
petrified
and
preserved
silence
their
feelings
were
on
the
turn
the
effect
produced
upon
gayarre
was
visible
to
all
he
seemed
covered
with
confusion
in
his
embarrassment
he
faltered
out
i
protest
against
this
that
paper
has
been
stolen
from
my
bureau
and
so
much
the
better
monsieur
gayarre
said
again
interrupting
him
so
much
the
better
you
confess
to
its
being
stolen
and
therefore
you
confess
to
its
being
genuine
now
sir
having
this
document
in
your
possession
and
knowing
its
contents
how
could
you
claim
aurore
besancon
as
your
slave
gayarre
was
confounded
his
cadaverous
face
became
of
a
white
sickly
hue
and
his
habitual
look
of
malice
rapidly
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
terror
he
appeared
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
gone
and
already
crouched
behind
the
taller
men
who
stood
around
him
stop
monsieur
gayarre
continued
the
inexorable
i
have
not
done
with
you
yet
here
justice
claiborne
i
have
another
document
that
may
interest
you
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
give
it
your
attention
saying
this
the
speaker
held
out
a
second
folded
parchment
which
was
handed
to
the
magistrate
who
as
before
opened
the
document
and
read
it
aloud
this
was
a
codicil
to
the
will
of
auguste
besancon
by
which
the
sum
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
bank
stock
was
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
eugenie
besancon
to
be
paid
to
her
upon
the
day
on
which
she
should
be
of
age
by
the
joint
executors
of
the
estate
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
and
antoine
lereux
and
these
executors
were
instructed
not
to
make
known
to
the
recipient
the
existence
of
this
sum
in
her
favour
until
the
very
day
of
its
payment
now
monsieur
dominique
gayarre
continued
as
soon
as
the
reading
was
finished
i
charge
you
with
the
embezzlement
of
this
fifty
thousand
dollars
with
various
other
sums
of
which
more
hereafter
i
charge
you
with
having
concealed
the
existence
of
this
money
of
having
withheld
it
from
the
assets
of
the
estate
besancon
of
having
appropriated
it
to
your
own
use
this
is
a
serious
charge
said
justice
claiborne
evidently
impressed
with
its
truth
and
prepared
to
entertain
it
your
name
sir
if
you
please
continued
he
interrogating
in
a
mild
tone
of
voice
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
in
the
full
light
of
day
all
that
had
yet
passed
between
us
had
taken
place
either
in
the
darkness
of
night
or
by
the
light
of
lamps
that
morning
alone
had
we
been
together
for
a
few
minutes
by
daylight
but
even
then
it
was
under
the
sombre
shadow
of
the
woods
where
i
could
have
but
a
faint
view
of
his
features
now
that
he
stood
in
the
light
of
the
open
window
i
had
a
full
clear
view
of
his
face
the
resemblance
to
some
one
i
had
seen
before
again
impressed
me
it
grew
stronger
as
i
gazed
and
before
the
interrogatory
had
received
its
reply
the
shock
of
my
astonishment
had
passed
your
name
sir
if
you
please
repeated
the
justice
at
the
same
instant
the
hat
was
pulled
off
the
black
curls
were
drawn
aside
and
the
fair
golden
tresses
of
the
beautiful
creole
exhibited
to
the
view
a
loud
huzza
broke
out
in
which
all
joined
excepting
gayarre
and
his
two
or
three
ruffian
adherents
i
felt
that
i
was
free
the
conditions
had
suddenly
changed
and
the
plaintiff
had
taken
the
place
of
the
defendant
even
before
the
excitement
had
quieted
down
i
saw
the
sheriff
at
the
instigation
of
reigart
and
others
stride
forward
to
gayarre
and
placing
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
latter
arrest
him
as
his
prisoner
it
is
false
cried
gayarre
a
plot
a
damnable
plot
these
documents
are
forgeries
the
signatures
are
false
false
not
so
monsieur
gayarre
said
the
justice
interrupting
him
those
documents
are
not
forgeries
this
is
the
handwriting
of
auguste
besancon
i
knew
him
well
this
is
his
signature
i
could
myself
swear
to
it
and
i
responded
a
voice
in
a
deep
solemn
tone
which
drew
the
attention
of
all
the
transformation
of
eugene
to
eugenie
besancon
had
astonished
the
crowd
but
a
greater
surprise
awaited
them
in
the
resurrection
of
the
reader
my
story
is
ended
here
upon
our
little
drama
must
the
curtain
drop
i
might
offer
you
other
tableaux
to
illustrate
the
after
history
of
our
characters
but
a
slight
summary
must
suffice
your
fancy
will
supply
the
details
it
will
glad
you
to
know
then
that
eugenie
besancon
recovered
the
whole
of
her
property
which
was
soon
restored
to
its
flourishing
condition
under
the
faithful
stewardship
of
antoine
alas
there
was
that
that
could
never
be
restored
the
young
cheerful
heart
the
buoyant
spirit
the
virgin
love
but
do
not
imagine
that
eugenie
besancon
yielded
to
despair
that
she
was
ever
after
the
victim
of
that
unhappy
passion
no
hers
was
a
mighty
will
and
all
its
energies
were
employed
to
pluck
the
fatal
arrow
from
her
heart
time
and
a
virtuous
life
have
much
power
but
far
more
effective
was
that
sympathy
of
the
object
beloved
that
for
which
to
her
was
fully
accorded
her
heart
young
hope
was
crushed
her
gay
spirit
shrouded
but
there
are
other
joys
in
life
besides
the
play
of
the
passions
and
it
may
be
the
path
of
love
is
not
the
true
road
to
happiness
oh
that
i
could
believe
this
oh
that
i
could
reason
myself
into
the
belief
that
that
calm
and
unruffled
mien
that
soft
sweet
smile
were
the
tokens
of
a
heart
at
rest
alas
i
can
not
fate
will
have
its
victims
poor
eugenie
god
be
merciful
to
thee
oh
that
i
could
steep
thy
heart
in
the
waters
of
lethe
and
reigart
you
reader
will
be
glad
to
know
that
the
good
doctor
prospered
prospered
until
he
was
enabled
to
lay
aside
his
lancet
and
become
a
grandee
planter
nay
more
a
distinguished
legislator
one
of
those
to
whom
belongs
the
credit
of
having
modelled
the
present
system
of
louisiana
law
the
most
advanced
code
in
the
civilised
world
you
will
be
glad
to
learn
that
scipio
with
his
chloe
and
the
leetle
chloe
were
brought
back
to
their
old
and
now
happy
home
that
the
still
retained
his
brawny
arms
and
never
afterwards
had
occasion
to
seek
refuge
in
his
you
will
not
be
grieved
to
know
that
gayarre
passed
several
years
of
his
in
the
of
baton
rouge
and
then
disappeared
altogether
from
the
scene
it
was
said
that
under
a
changed
name
he
returned
to
france
his
native
country
his
conviction
was
easy
antoine
had
long
suspected
him
of
a
design
to
plunder
their
joint
ward
and
had
determined
to
put
him
to
the
proof
the
raft
of
chairs
had
floated
after
all
and
by
the
help
of
these
the
faithful
steward
had
gained
the
shore
far
down
the
river
no
one
knew
of
his
escape
and
the
idea
occurred
to
this
strange
old
man
to
remain
for
a
while
a
silent
spectator
of
the
conduct
of
monsieur
dominique
no
sooner
did
gayarre
believe
him
gone
than
the
latter
advanced
boldly
upon
his
purpose
and
hurried
events
to
the
described
crisis
it
was
just
what
antoine
had
expected
and
acting
himself
as
the
accuser
the
conviction
of
the
avocat
was
easy
and
certain
a
sentence
of
five
years
to
the
state
penitentiary
wound
up
gayarre
connexion
with
the
characters
of
our
story
it
will
scarce
grieve
you
to
know
that
bully
bill
experienced
a
somewhat
similar
fate
that
ruffin
the
was
drowned
by
a
sudden
rising
of
the
swamp
and
that
the
afterwards
became
a
and
for
that
crime
was
sentenced
at
the
court
of
judge
lynch
to
the
punishment
of
tar
and
feathers
the
sportsmen
chorley
and
hatcher
i
never
saw
again
though
their
future
is
not
unknown
to
me
chorley
the
brave
and
accomplished
but
wicked
chorley
was
killed
in
a
duel
by
a
creole
of
new
orleans
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
at
play
hatcher
bank
got
broke
soon
after
and
a
series
of
at
length
reduced
him
to
the
condition
of
a
and
small
sharper
in
general
the
i
met
many
years
afterward
as
a
successful
dealer
in
the
halls
of
the
montezumas
thither
he
had
gone
a
of
the
american
army
and
had
accumulated
an
enormous
fortune
by
keeping
a
for
the
officers
he
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
his
evil
gains
the
caught
him
at
vera
cruz
and
his
dust
is
now
mingled
with
the
sands
of
that
dreary
shore
thus
reader
it
has
been
my
happy
fortune
to
record
to
the
various
characters
that
have
figured
in
the
pages
of
our
history
i
hear
you
exclaim
that
two
have
been
forgotten
the
hero
and
heroine
ah
no
not
forgotten
would
you
have
me
paint
the
ceremony
the
pomp
and
splendour
the
ribbons
and
rosettes
the
of
perfect
bliss
hymen
forbid
all
these
must
be
left
to
your
fancy
if
your
fancy
deign
to
act
but
the
interest
of
a
lover
adventures
usually
ends
with
the
consummation
of
his
hopes
not
even
always
extending
to
the
altar
and
you
reader
will
scarce
be
curious
to
lift
the
curtain
that
veils
the
tranquil
of
myself
and
my
beautiful
quadroon
note
to
the
preface
after
what
has
been
stated
in
the
preface
it
will
scarce
be
necessary
to
say
that
the
and
some
of
the
mentioned
in
this
book
are
fictitious
some
of
the
scenes
and
many
of
the
characters
that
figure
in
these
pages
are
and
there
are
those
living
who
will
recognise
them
the
book
is
founded
upon
an
actual
experience
it
was
written
many
years
ago
and
would
have
been
then
published
but
for
the
interference
of
a
work
which
treated
of
similar
scenes
and
subjects
that
work
appeared
just
as
the
quadroon
was
about
to
be
put
to
press
and
the
author
of
the
the
latter
not
willing
to
risk
the
chances
of
being
considered
an
imitator
had
determined
on
keeping
the
quadroon
from
the
public
circumstances
have
ruled
it
otherwise
and
having
some
parts
of
the
work
he
now
presents
it
to
the
reader
as
a
painting
somewhat
coarse
and
crude
perhaps
of
life
in
louisiana
the
author
disclaims
all
intention
the
book
has
been
written
neither
to
aid
the
abolitionist
nor
glorify
the
planter
the
author
does
not
believe
that
by
such
means
he
could
benefit
the
slave
else
he
would
not
fear
to
avow
it
on
the
other
hand
he
is
too
true
a
republican
to
be
the
instrument
that
would
add
one
drop
to
the
bad
blood
which
unfortunately
for
the
cause
of
human
freedom
has
already
arisen
between
north
and
south
no
he
will
be
the
last
man
to
aid
european
despots
in
this
their
dearest
wish
and
desperate
hope
