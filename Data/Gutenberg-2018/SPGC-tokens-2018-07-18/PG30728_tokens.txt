felt
excitement
surge
like
a
living
tide
about
him
as
he
came
with
the
other
directors
into
the
vast
tribunal
hall
sixty
years
ago
inexcusable
carelessness
had
deprived
earth
of
its
first
chance
to
obtain
a
true
interstellar

the

of
that
great
political

called

controlled
the

a
half
should
learn
enough
of

of
the

to
insure
that
it
would
soon
be
in

possession
menesee
entered
his
box
between
those
of
directors
cornelius
and
ojeda
immediately
to
the
right
of
the
spokesman
platform
and
with
an
excellent
view
of
the
prisoner
when
administrator
bradshaw
and
spokesman
dorn
had
taken
their
places
on
the
platform
menesee
seated
himself
drawing
the
transcript
of
the
day
proceedings
towards
him
however
instead
of
glancing
over
it
at
once
he
spent
some
seconds
in
a
study
of
the
prisoner
the
fellow
appeared
to
be
still
young
he
was
a
magnificent
physical
specimen
tall
and
strongly
muscled
easily
surpassing
in
this
respect
any
of
the
directors
present
his
face
showed
alert
intelligence
giving
no
indication
of
the
fact
that
for
two
of
the
three
days
since
his
capture
he
had
been
drugged
and
subject
to
constant
hypnotic
suggestion
he
had
given
his
name
as
rainbolt
acknowledged
freely
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
group
of
malcontent
deserters
known
in
the
records
of
the
machine
as
the
mars
convicts
but
described
himself
as
being
a
missionary
of
oneness
whose
purpose
was
to
bring
the
benefits
of
some
of
the
principles
of
oneness
to
earth
he
had
refused
to
state
whether
he
had
any
understanding
of
the
stardrive
by
the
use
of
which
the
mars
convicts
had
made
their
mass
escape
from
the
penal
settlements
of
the
fourth
planet
sixty
years
before
though
the
drive
obviously
had
been
employed
in
bringing
him
out
of
the
depths
of
interstellar
space
to
the
solar
system
and
earth
at
the
moment
while
the
significance
of
the
bank
of
torture
instruments
on
his
right
could
hardly
have
escaped
him
his
expression
was
serious
but
not
detectably
concerned
here
is
an
interesting
point
director
ojeda
voice
said
on
menesee
right
menesee
glanced
over
at
him
ojeda
was
tapping
the
transcript
with
a
finger
this
rainbolt
he
said
has
slept
since
he
was
captured
he
states
furthermore
that
he
has
never
slept
since
he
became
an
adult
menesee
frowned
slightly
failing
to
see
any
great
significance
in
the
fact
that
the
fellow
belonged
to
some
curious
cult
which
had
developed
among
the
mars
convicts
following
their
flight
from
the
solar
system
was
already
known
earth
science
had
methods
of
inducing
permanent
sleeplessness
but
knew
too
that
in
most
instances
the
condition
eventually
gave
rise
to
very
serious
side
effects
which
more
than
offset
any
advantages
to
be
gained
from
it
he
picked
up
his
transcript
indicating
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
drawn
into
conversation
his
eyes
scanned
quickly
over
the
pages
most
of
it
was
information
he
already
had
rainbolt
ship
had
been
detected
four
days
earlier
probing
the
outermost
of
the
multiple
globes
of
force
screens
which
had
enclosed
earth
for
fifty
years
as
a
defense
both
against
missiles
and
mars
convict
spies
the
ship
was
alone
a
procedure
had
been
planned
for
such
an
event
and
it
was
now
followed
the
ship
was
permitted
to
penetrate
the
first
two
screens
which
were
closed
again
behind
it
rainbolt
ship
for
all
its
incredible
speed
was
then
a
prisoner
unhurriedly
it
was
worked
closer
to
earth
until
it
came
within
range
of
giant
scanners
for
an
instant
a
large
section
of
its
interior
was
visible
to
the
instruments
of
the
watchers
on
earth
then
the
picture
blurred
and
vanished
again
presumably
automatic
devices
had
gone
into
action
the
photographed
view
was
disappointing
in
that
it
revealed
no
details
of
the
engines
or
their
instruments
it
did
show
however
that
the
ship
had
been
designed
for
the
use
of
one
man
and
that
it
was
neither
armored
or
armed
its
hull
was
therefore
bathed
with
paralytics
which
in
theory
should
have
left
the
pilot
helpless
and
ships
of
the
machine
were
then
sent
up
to
tow
the
interstellar
captive
down
to
earth
at
that
point
the
procedure
collapsed
the
ship
was
in
atmosphere
when
an
escape
capsule
was
suddenly
ejected
from
it
which
later
was
found
to
contain
rainbolt
alert
and
obviously
not
affected
by
the
paralysis
beams
a
moment
later
the
ship
itself
became
a
cloud
of
swiftly
dissipating
hot
gas
the
partial
failure
of
the
capture
might
have
been
unavoidable
in
any
case
but
the
manner
in
which
it
occurred
still
reflected
very
poorly
menesee
thought
on
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
plans
had
been
prepared
the
directors
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
operation
would
not
be
dealt
with
lightly
he
became
aware
suddenly
that
the
proceedings
of
the
day
had
begun
and
hastily
put
down
the
transcript
spokesman
dorn
the
machine
executive
officer
sitting
beside
administrator
bradshaw
at
a
transparent
desk
on
the
raised
platform
to
menesee
left
had
enclosed
the
area
about
the
prisoner
with
a
sound
block
and
was
giving
a
brief
verbal
resume
of
the
background
of
the
situation
few
of
the
directors
in
the
tribunal
hall
would
have
needed
such
information
but
the
matter
was
being
carried
on
the
grand
assembly
circuit
and
in
hundreds
of
auditoriums
on
earth
the
first
and
second
echelons
of
the
officials
of
the
machine
had
gathered
to
witness
the
interrogation
of
the
mars
convict
spy
the
penal
settlements
on
mars
had
been
established
almost
a
century
earlier
for
the
dual
purpose
of
mining
the
mineral
riches
of
the
fourth
planet
and
of
utilizing
the
talents
of
political
dissidents
with
a
scientific
background
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
in
research
and
experimental
work
considered
either
too
dangerous
to
be
conducted
on
earth
or
requiring
more
space
than
could
easily
be
made
available
there
one
of
these
projects
had
been
precisely
the
development
of
more
efficient
spacedrives
to
do
away
with
the
costly
and
tedious
manoeuverings
required
for
travel
even
among
the
inner
planets
work
of
such
importance
of
course
was
supposed
to
be
carried
out
only
under
close
guard
and
under
the
direct
supervision
of
reliable
scientists
of
the
machine
even
allowing
for
criminal
negligence
the
fact
that
the
mars
convicts
were
able
to
develop
and
test
their
stardrive
under
such
circumstances
without
being
detected
suggested
that
it
could
not
be
a
complicated
device
they
did
at
any
rate
develop
it
armed
themselves
and
the
miners
of
the
other
penal
settlements
and
overwhelmed
their
guards
in
surprise
attack
when
the
next
ship
arrived
from
earth
two
giant
ore
carriers
and
a
number
of
smaller
guard
ships
had
been
outfitted
with
the
drive
and
the
mars
convicts
had
disappeared
in
them
their
speed
was
such
that
only
the
faintest
and
briefest
of
disturbances
had
been
registered
on
the
tracking
screens
of
space
stations
near
mars
the
cause
of
which
remained
unsuspected
until
the
news
came
out
anything
which
could
have
thrown
any
light
on
the
nature
of
the
drive
naturally
had
been
destroyed
by
the
deserters
before
they
left
and
the
few
machine
scientists
who
had
survived
the
fighting
were
unable
to
provide
information
though
they
were
questioned
intensively
for
several
years
before
being
executed
what
it
added
up
to
was
that
some
eighteen
thousand
sworn
enemies
of
the
machine
had
disappeared
into
space
equipped
with
an
instrument
of
unknown
type
which
plainly
could
be
turned
into
one
of
the
deadliest
of
all
known
weapons
the
superb
organization
of
the
machine
swung
into
action
instantly
to
meet
the
threat
though
the
situation
became
complicated
by
the
fact
that
rumors
of
the
manner
in
which
the
mars
convicts
had
disappeared
filtered
out
to
the
politically
dissatisfied
on
earth
and
set
off
an
unprecedented
series
of
local
uprisings
which
took
over
a
decade
to
quell
in
spite
of
such
difficulties
the
planet
economy
was
geared
over
to
the
new
task
and
presently
defenses
were
devised
and
being
constructed
which
would
stop
missiles
arriving
at
speeds
greater
than
that
of
light
simultaneously
the
greatest
research
project
in
history
had
begun
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
either
duplicating
the
fantastic
drive
some
scientific
minds
on
mars
had
come
upon
chiefly
it
was
concluded
by
an
improbable
stroke
of
good
luck
or
of
matching
its
effects
through
a
different
approach
since
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
it
could
be
done
there
was
no
question
that
in
time
the
trained
men
of
the
machine
would
achieve
their
goal
then
the
armed
might
of
the
machine
would
move
into
space
to
take
control
of
any
colony
established
by
the
mars
convicts
and
their
descendants
that
was
the
basic
plan
the
task
of
developing
a
stardrive
remained
a
huge
one
because
of
the
complete
lack
of
information
about
the
direction
organized
research
should
take
that
difficulty
would
be
overcome
easily
only
by
a
second
unpredictable
twist
of
fortune
unless
one
of
the
mars
convicts
ftl
ships
ventured
close
enough
to
earth
to
be
captured
the
last
had
now
happened
the
ship
had
been
destroyed
before
it
could
be
investigated
so
that
advantage
was
again
lost
the
ship
pilot
however
remained
in
their
hands
the
fact
that
he
disclaimed
having
information
pertinent
to
the
drive
meant
nothing
so
far
as
he
knew
he
might
very
well
be
speaking
the
truth
but
he
had
piloted
a
ship
that
employed
the
stardrive
was
familiar
with
instruments
which
controlled
it
had
been
schooled
in
their
use
a
detailed
investigation
of
his
memories
could
not
fail
to
provide
literally
hundreds
of
meaningful
clues
and
the
machine
scientists
in
their
superficially
still
fruitless
search
for
the
nature
of
the
drive
had
in
fact
covered
basic
possibilities
with
such
comprehensive
thoroughness
that
a
few
indisputably
valid
clues
would
show
them
now
what
it
be
the
prisoner
still
demonstrating
an
extraordinary
degree
of
obliviousness
to
what
lay
in
store
for
him
appeared
to
welcome
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
the
directors
of
the
machine
menesee
leaning
back
in
his
chair
studied
the
man
thoughtfully
giving
only
partial
attention
to
what
was
said
this
was
the
standard
opening
stage
of
a
tribunal
interrogation
an
underplayed
exchange
of
questions
and
answers
innocuous
as
it
seemed
it
was
part
of
a
procedure
which
had
become
refined
almost
to
an
unvarying
ritual
a
ritual
of
beautiful
and
terrible
precision
which
never
failed
to
achieve
its
goals
every
man
watching
and
listening
in
the
auditoriums
across
the
world
was
familiar
with
the
swift
processes
by
which
a
normal
human
being
was
transformed
into
a
babbling
puppet
his
every
significant
thought
becoming
available
for
the
upper
echelons
to
regard
and
evaluate
they
would
of
course
use
torture
it
was
part
of
the
interlocking
mechanisms
of
interrogation
no
more
to
be
omitted
than
the
preliminary
conditioning
by
drug
and
hypnosis
menesee
was
not
unduly
squeamish
but
he
felt
some
relief
that
it
would
not
be
the
crude
instruments
ranked
beside
the
prisoner
which
would
be
used
they
were
reserved
as
a
rule
for
offending
members
of
the
organization
providing
a
salutary
warning
for
any
others
who
might
be
tempted
to
act
against
the
interests
of
the
machine
or
fail
culpably
in
their
duties
this
prisoner
as
an
individual
meant
nothing
to
the
machine
he
was
simply
a
source
of
valuable
information
therefore
only
direct
nerve
stimulation
would
be
employed
in
the
manipulation
of
which
spokesman
dorn
was
a
master
so
far
the
spokesman
had
restricted
himself
to
asking
the
prisoner
questions
his
voice
and
manner
gravely
courteous
to
surprised
interest
he
had
just
inquired
whether
two
men
of
the
last
earth
ship
to
visit
mars
who
had
disappeared
there
might
not
have
been
captured
by
mars
convicts
operating
secretly
within
the
solar
system
yes
sir
rainbolt
replied
readily
they
were
i
happy
to
say
that
they
still
alive
and
well
menesee
recalled
the
incident
now
after
the
mass
escape
of
the
mars
convicts
the
penal
settlements
had
been
closed
down
and
the
mining
operations
abandoned
to
guard
the
desert
planet
against
ftl
raiders
as
earth
was
guarded
was
technically
infeasible
but
twice
each
decade
a
patrol
ship
went
there
to
look
for
signs
that
the
mars
convicts
had
returned
the
last
of
these
patrols
had
been
conducted
two
years
before
the
missing
men
were
believed
to
have
been
inspecting
a
deserted
settlement
in
a
ground
vehicle
when
they
vanished
but
no
trace
of
them
or
the
vehicle
could
be
discovered
administrator
bradshaw
seated
to
the
spokesman
left
leaned
forward
as
if
to
speak
but
then
sat
back
again
menesee
thought
that
rainbolt
blunt
admission
had
angered
him
bradshaw
and
huge
in
build
had
been
for
many
years
the
nominal
head
of
the
machine
but
in
practice
the
powers
of
the
administrator
were
less
than
those
of
the
spokesman
and
it
would
have
been
a
breach
of
protocol
for
bradshaw
to
intervene
in
the
interrogation
dorn
appeared
to
have
noticed
nothing
he
went
on
what
was
the
reason
for
capturing
these
men
it
was
necessary
rainbolt
explained
to
find
out
what
the
conditions
on
earth
were
like
at
present
at
the
time
we
did
want
to
risk
discovery
by
coming
too
close
to
earth
itself
and
your
two
men
were
able
to
tell
us
all
we
needed
to
know
what
was
that
the
spokesman
said
rainbolt
was
silent
a
moment
then
said
you
see
sir
most
of
the
past
sixty
years
have
been
spent
in
finding
new
worlds
on
which
human
beings
can
live
without
encountering
too
many
difficulties
but
then
dorn
interrupted
quietly
you
found
such
worlds
yes
sir
we
did
rainbolt
said
we
established
in
about
equal
numbers
on
planets
of
three
star
systems
of
course
i
not
allowed
to
give
you
more
precise
information
on
that
at
present
quite
understandable
the
spokesman
agreed
dryly
menesee
was
conscious
of
a
stir
of
intense
interest
among
the
listening
directors
in
the
hall
this
was
news
indeed
mingled
with
the
interest
was
surprised
amusement
at
the
prisoner
artless
assumption
that
he
had
any
choice
about
what
he
would
or
would
not
tell
but
now
that
we
established
rainbolt
went
on
apparently
unaware
of
the
sensation
he
had
created
our
next
immediate
concern
is
to
resume
contact
with
earth
naturally
we
ca
do
that
freely
while
your
machine
remains
in
political
control
of
the
planet
we
found
out
from
the
two
captured
men
that
it
still
is
in
control
we
hoped
that
after
sixty
years
government
in
such
a
form
would
have
become
obselete
here
menesee
heard
an
astonished
murmuring
from
the
director
boxes
on
his
right
and
felt
himself
that
the
fellow
impudent
last
remark
might
well
have
been
answered
by
a
pulse
of
nerve
stimulation
spokesman
dorn
however
replied
calmly
that
the
machine
happened
to
be
indispensable
to
earth
a
planetary
economy
and
one
on
the
verge
of
becoming
an
interplanetary
and
even
interstellar
economy
was
simply
too
intricate
and
precariously
balanced
a
structure
to
maintain
without
the
assistance
of
a
very
tightly
organized
governing
class
if
the
machine
were
to
vanish
today
he
explained
earth
would
approach
a
state
of
complete
chaos
before
the
month
was
out
in
a
year
a
billion
human
beings
would
be
starving
to
death
there
would
be
fighting
wars
he
shrugged
you
name
it
no
my
friend
the
machine
is
here
to
stay
and
the
mars
convicts
may
as
well
resign
themselves
to
the
fact
rainbolt
replied
earnestly
that
he
was
not
too
well
informed
in
economics
that
not
being
his
field
however
he
had
been
told
and
believed
that
while
the
situation
described
by
the
spokesman
would
be
true
today
it
should
not
take
many
years
to
train
the
populations
of
earth
to
run
their
affairs
quite
as
efficiently
as
the
machine
had
done
and
without
loss
of
personal
and
political
liberties
at
any
rate
the
mars
convicts
and
their
descendants
did
not
intend
to
give
up
the
independence
they
had
acquired
on
the
other
hand
they
had
two
vital
reasons
for
wanting
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
earth
one
was
that
they
might
waste
centuries
in
attempting
to
accomplish
by
themselves
what
they
could
now
do
immediately
if
earth
vast
resources
were
made
available
to
them
and
the
other
of
course
was
the
obvious
fact
that
earth
would
not
remain
indefinitely
without
a
stardrive
of
its
own
if
an
unfriendly
government
was
in
control
when
it
obtained
one
the
mars
convicts
would
be
forced
either
to
abandon
their
newly
settled
planets
and
retreat
farther
into
the
galaxy
or
submit
to
earth
superior
strength
meanwhile
however
they
had
developed
the
principles
of
oneness
oneness
was
in
essence
a
philosophy
but
it
had
many
practical
applications
and
it
was
in
such
practical
applications
that
he
rainbolt
was
a
trained
specialist
he
had
therefore
been
dispatched
to
earth
to
introduce
the
principles
which
would
in
time
bring
about
the
orderly
disintegration
of
the
system
of
the
machine
to
be
followed
by
the
establishment
of
an
earth
government
with
which
the
mars
convicts
could
deal
without
detriment
to
themselves
menesee
had
listened
with
a
sense
of
growing
angry
incredulity
the
fellow
could
be
as
much
of
a
fool
as
he
seemed
therefore
he
had
devised
this
hoax
after
he
realised
he
would
be
captured
to
cover
up
his
real
purpose
which
could
only
be
that
of
a
spy
menesee
saw
that
administrator
bradshaw
was
saying
something
in
a
low
voice
to
the
spokesman
his
face
stony
dorn
glanced
over
at
him
then
looked
back
at
the
prisoner
and
said
impassively
so
the
goal
of
your
missionary
work
here
is
the
disintegration
of
the
machine
rainbolt
nodded
with
an
air
almost
of
eagerness
yes
sir
it
is
and
if
i
will
now
be
permitted
to
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
permitted
to
do
nothing
spokesman
dorn
said
dryly
except
of
course
to
answer
the
number
of
questions
we
intend
to
ask
you
rainbolt
checked
himself
looking
startled
the
spokesman
hand
had
moved
very
slightly
on
the
desk
before
him
and
rainbolt
had
just
had
his
first
experience
with
direct
nerve
stimulation
he
stood
kneading
his
right
hand
with
his
left
staring
up
at
the
spokesman
mouth
half
open
menesee
smiled
in
grim
amusement
it
would
have
been
a
pulse
of
course
but
even
a
pulse
arriving
unexpectedly
was
a
very
unpleasant
surprise
he
had
foreseen
the
action
had
in
fact
felt
a
sympathetic
imaginary
twinge
in
his
own
right
hand
as
the
pulse
reached
the
prisoner
rainbolt
swallowed
said
in
a
changed
voice
sir
we
heard
from
the
two
captured
men
that
the
machine
has
retained
its
practice
of
torture
during
interrogations
it
is
necessary
to
convince
me
that
you
are
serious
about
this
do
the
questions
you
referred
to
have
to
do
with
the
stardrive
the
spokesman
nodded
of
course
rainbolt
said
stubbornly
then
sir
it
can
do
you
no
good
at
all
to
torture
me
i
simply
do
have
such
information
we
do
plan
to
make
the
stardrive
freely
available
to
earth
but
not
while
earth
is
ruled
by
the
organization
of
the
machine
this
time
menesee
did
not
observe
the
motion
of
the
spokesman
hand
instead
he
saw
rainbolt
jerk
violently
to
the
right
at
the
same
moment
a
blast
of
intense
fiery
almost
unbearable
pain
shot
up
his
own
arm
as
he
grasped
his
arm
sweat
spurting
out
on
his
face
he
heard
screams
from
the
box
on
his
left
and
realized
it
was
director
cornelius
who
screamed
there
were
answering
screams
from
around
the
hall
illustration
then
the
pain
suddenly
subsided
menesee
started
about
breathing
raggedly
the
had
been
severe
enough
to
affect
his
vision
the
great
hall
looked
momentarily
darker
than
it
should
have
been
and
although
the
actual
pain
had
ended
the
muscles
of
his
arm
and
shoulder
were
still
trying
to
cramp
into
knots
there
was
no
more
screaming
from
the
right
came
director
gasping
voice
what
happened
did
something
go
wrong
with
the
stimulating
devices
we
might
all
have
been
killed
menesee
did
reply
wherever
he
looked
he
saw
faces
whitened
with
shock
apparently
everyone
in
the
tribunal
hall
from
the
administrator
and
spokesman
dorn
on
down
to
the
directors
attendants
and
the
two
guards
flanking
the
prisoner
area
had
felt
the
same
thing
here
and
there
men
who
had
collapsed
were
struggling
awkwardly
back
to
their
feet
he
heard
a
hoarse
whisper
behind
him
sir
director
cornelius
appears
to
have
fainted
menesee
glanced
around
saw
cornelius
attendant
behind
the
box
then
cornelius
himself
slumped
forward
face
down
and
motionless
sprawling
half
across
his
table
let
him
lie
there
and
keep
quiet
fool
menesee
ordered
the
man
sharply
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
center
of
the
hall
as
spokesman
dorn
announced
in
a
voice
which
held
more
of
an
edge
than
was
normal
but
had
lost
none
of
its
strength
and
steadiness
before
any
moves
are
suggested
i
shall
tell
you
what
has
been
done
the
tribunal
hall
has
been
sealed
and
further
events
in
it
will
be
monitored
from
without
no
one
will
be
able
to
leave
until
the
matter
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
here
has
been
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
machine
next
any
of
you
who
believe
that
an
instrument
failure
was
involved
in
the
experience
we
shared
can
disabuse
themselves
the
same
effect
was
reported
immediately
from
two
other
auditoriums
on
the
great
circuit
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
it
was
repeated
in
all
of
them
rainbolt
grimacing
and
massaging
his
right
arm
vigorously
nodded
it
was
repeated
in
all
of
them
sir
the
spokesman
ignored
him
went
on
the
tribunal
hall
has
therefore
been
cut
out
of
the
grand
assembly
circuit
how
circuit
energies
could
have
been
employed
to
transmit
such
physical
sensations
is
not
clear
but
they
will
not
be
used
in
that
manner
again
menesee
felt
a
flash
of
admiration
his
own
thoughts
had
been
turning
in
the
same
direction
but
he
could
have
approached
spokesman
dorn
decisive
speed
of
action
dorn
turned
his
attention
now
to
rainbolt
what
happened
he
said
apparently
was
caused
by
yourself
rainbolt
nodded
yes
sir
it
was
it
was
an
application
of
oneness
at
present
i
acting
as
a
focal
point
of
oneness
until
that
condition
is
changed
whatever
i
experience
here
will
be
simultaneously
experienced
by
yourselves
menesee
thought
that
the
effects
of
the
machine
discipline
became
splendidly
apparent
at
that
point
no
one
stirred
in
the
great
hall
though
it
must
have
been
obvious
to
every
man
present
that
words
might
have
doomed
them
along
with
himself
rainbolt
went
on
addressing
spokesman
dorn
there
is
only
one
mistake
in
your
reasoning
sir
the
demonstrated
effect
of
oneness
is
not
carried
by
the
energies
of
the
grand
assembly
circuit
though
i
made
use
of
those
energies
in
establishing
an
initial
connection
with
the
other
auditoriums
and
the
people
in
them
you
see
sir
we
learned
from
the
two
men
captured
on
mars
about
your
practice
of
having
the
two
highest
echelons
of
your
organization
attend
significant
hearings
in
the
tribunal
hall
through
the
assembly
circuit
our
plan
was
based
on
that
we
knew
that
if
anything
was
to
be
accomplished
with
the
oneness
principles
on
earth
it
would
have
to
be
through
a
situation
in
which
they
could
be
applied
simultaneously
to
the
entire
leadership
of
the
machine
that
has
now
been
done
and
the
fact
that
you
had
the
tribunal
hall
taken
out
of
the
assembly
circuit
did
not
change
the
oneness
contact
it
remains
in
full
effect
spokesman
dorn
stared
at
him
for
an
instant
said
we
can
test
the
truth
of
that
statement
immediately
of
course
and
we
shall
his
hand
moved
on
the
desk
menesee
felt
pain
surge
through
his
left
arm
it
was
not
nearly
as
acute
a
sensation
as
the
previous
pulse
had
been
but
it
lasted
longer
a
good
ten
seconds
menesee
let
his
breath
out
carefully
as
it
again
ebbed
away
he
heard
the
spokesman
saying
rainbolt
claim
appears
to
be
verified
i
received
a
report
that
the
pulse
was
being
experienced
in
one
of
the
auditoriums
and
yes
now
in
several
rainbolt
nodded
it
was
a
valid
claim
believe
me
sir
he
said
earnestly
the
applications
of
our
principles
have
been
very
thoroughly
explored
and
the
effects
are
invariable
naturally
our
strategem
would
have
been
useless
if
i
been
able
to
maintain
contact
only
long
enough
to
provide
you
with
a
demonstration
of
oneness
such
a
contact
can
be
broken
again
of
course
but
until
i
act
deliberately
to
break
it
it
maintains
itself
automatically
to
make
that
clear
i
should
explain
that
distance
direction
and
intervening
shielding
materials
do
not
change
the
strength
of
the
contact
distance
at
least
does
not
until
it
is
extended
to
approximately
fifty
thousand
miles
and
what
happens
then
the
spokesman
asked
watching
him
at
that
point
rainbolt
acknowledged
oneness
contacts
do
become
tenuous
and
begin
to
dissolve
he
added
almost
apologetically
however
that
offers
you
no
practical
solution
to
your
problem
why
not
dorn
asked
he
smiled
faintly
why
should
we
simply
lock
you
into
a
spaceship
and
direct
the
ship
through
the
defense
fields
and
out
into
the
solar
system
on
automatic
control
i
sincerely
hope
you
do
try
it
sir
experiments
in
dissolving
contacts
in
that
manner
have
been
invariably
fatal
to
all
connected
individuals
the
spokesman
hesitated
you
and
every
member
of
the
machine
with
whom
you
are
now
in
contact
would
die
together
if
that
were
done
yes
sir
that
is
certain
what
the
results
of
those
experiments
show
administrator
bradshaw
who
had
been
staring
coldly
at
rainbolt
asked
in
a
hard
flat
voice
if
you
do
nothing
to
break
the
contact
how
long
will
this
situation
continue
rainbolt
looked
at
him
indefinitely
sir
he
said
there
is
nothing
i
need
to
do
about
it
it
is
a
static
condition
in
that
case
bradshaw
said
icily
should
serve
to
break
the
contact
through
you
as
his
hand
came
up
leveling
a
gun
menesee
was
half
out
of
his
chair
hands
raised
in
alarmed
protest
stop
him
menesee
shouted
but
administrator
bradshaw
already
was
sagging
sideways
over
the
armrest
of
this
chair
head
lolling
backwards
the
gun
slid
from
his
hand
dropped
to
the
platform
director
menesee
dorn
said
coolly
from
beside
bradshaw
i
thank
you
for
your
intended
warning
since
the
administrator
and
the
spokesman
are
the
only
persons
permitted
to
bear
arms
in
the
tribunal
hall
i
was
naturally
prepared
to
paralyze
administrator
bradshaw
if
he
showed
intentions
of
resorting
to
thoughtless
action
he
looked
down
at
rainbolt
are
director
menesee
and
i
correct
in
assuming
that
if
you
died
violently
the
persons
with
whom
you
are
in
contact
would
again
suffer
the
same
experience
yes
sir
rainbolt
said
that
is
implicit
in
the
principles
of
oneness
he
shrugged
under
most
circumstances
it
is
a
very
undesirable
effect
but
here
we
have
made
use
of
it
the
situation
spokesman
dorn
told
the
directors
in
the
tribunal
hall
some
minutes
later
is
then
this
there
has
been
nothing
haphazard
about
the
mars
convicts
plan
to
coerce
us
into
accepting
their
terms
considering
the
probable
quality
of
the
type
of
minds
which
developed
both
the
stardrive
and
the
extraordinary
we
have
encountered
today
that
could
be
taken
for
granted
from
the
start
we
can
not
kill
their
emissary
here
or
subject
him
to
serious
pain
or
injury
since
we
would
pay
a
completely
disproportionate
penalty
in
doing
it
however
that
does
mean
that
we
should
surrender
to
the
mars
convicts
in
fact
for
all
their
cleverness
they
appear
to
be
acting
out
of
something
very
close
to
desperation
they
have
gained
no
essential
advantage
through
their
trick
and
we
must
assume
they
made
the
mistake
of
underestimating
us
this
gentleman
they
sent
to
earth
has
been
given
thorough
physical
examinations
they
show
him
to
be
in
excellent
health
he
is
also
younger
by
many
years
than
most
of
us
so
he
will
be
confined
to
quarters
where
he
will
be
comfortable
and
provided
with
whatever
he
wishes
but
where
he
will
not
be
provided
with
any
way
of
doing
harm
to
himself
and
then
i
believe
we
can
simply
forget
about
him
he
will
receive
the
best
of
attention
including
medical
care
under
such
circumstances
we
can
expect
his
natural
life
span
to
exceed
our
own
meanwhile
we
shall
continue
our
program
of
developing
our
own
spacedrive
as
the
mars
convicts
themselves
foresee
we
gain
it
eventually
and
will
then
be
more
than
a
match
for
them
until
then
the
defense
fields
around
earth
will
remain
closed
no
ship
will
leave
earth
and
no
ship
will
be
admitted
to
it
and
in
the
long
run
we
will
win
the
spokesman
paused
added
if
there
are
no
other
suggestions
this
man
will
now
be
conducted
to
the
hospital
of
the
machine
where
he
is
to
be
detained
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
across
the
hall
from
menesee
a
figure
arose
deliberately
in
one
of
the
boxes
a
heavy
voice
said
spokesman
dorn
i
very
definitely
do
have
a
suggestion
dorn
looked
over
nodded
warily
go
ahead
director
squires
menesee
grimaced
in
distaste
he
had
no
liking
for
squires
a
harsh
arrogant
man
notorious
for
his
relentless
persecution
of
any
director
or
officer
who
in
squires
opinion
had
become
slack
in
his
duties
to
the
machine
but
he
had
a
large
following
in
the
upper
echelons
and
his
words
carried
weight
squires
folded
his
arms
said
unhurriedly
as
if
savoring
each
word
as
you
pointed
out
spokesman
dorn
we
can
not
hurt
the
person
of
this
prisoner
his
immediate
accomplices
also
remain
beyond
our
reach
at
present
however
our
hands
are
not
as
you
seem
to
imply
so
completely
tied
that
we
can
not
strike
back
at
these
rascals
at
once
there
are
camps
on
earth
filled
with
people
of
the
same
political
stripe
potential
supporters
of
the
mars
convicts
who
would
be
in
fullest
sympathy
with
their
goals
if
they
learned
of
them
i
suggest
that
these
people
serve
now
as
an
object
lesson
to
show
the
mars
convicts
the
full
measure
of
our
determination
to
submit
to
no
threats
of
force
let
this
prisoner
and
the
other
convicts
who
doubtless
are
lurking
in
nearby
space
beyond
earth
defense
fields
know
that
every
their
obscene
threat
against
the
high
officers
of
the
machine
continues
hundreds
of
malcontents
who
would
welcome
them
on
earth
will
be
painfully
executed
let
them
pain
doubled
menesee
abruptly
over
the
table
before
him
a
savage
compressing
pain
very
different
from
the
fiery
touch
of
the
nerve
stimulators
which
held
him
immobile
unable
to
cry
out
or
draw
breath
it
relaxed
almost
as
instantaneously
as
it
had
come
on
menesee
slumped
back
in
his
chair
shaken
and
choking
fighting
down
bitter
nausea
his
eyes
refocused
painfully
on
rainbolt
but
on
his
feet
in
the
prisoner
area
you
will
find
rainbolt
was
saying
that
director
squires
is
dead
and
so
i
very
much
afraid
is
every
other
member
of
the
upper
echelons
whose
heart
was
in
no
better
condition
than
his
this
was
a
demonstration
i
had
not
intended
to
give
you
but
since
it
has
been
given
it
should
serve
as
a
reminder
that
while
it
is
true
we
could
not
force
you
directly
to
do
as
we
wish
there
are
things
we
are
resolved
not
to
tolerate
ojeda
was
whispering
shakily
near
menesee
he
controls
his
body
to
the
extent
that
he
was
able
to
bring
on
a
heart
attack
in
himself
and
project
it
to
all
of
us
he
counted
on
his
own
superb
physical
condition
to
pull
him
through
it
unharmed
is
why
he
seem
frightened
when
the
administrator
threatened
him
with
a
gun
even
if
the
spokesman
had
acted
that
gun
never
would
have
been
fired
menesee
no
precautions
we
could
take
will
stop
that
monster
from
killing
us
all
whenever
he
finally
chooses
simply
by
committing
suicide
through
an
act
of
will
spokesman
dorn
voice
seemed
to
answer
ojeda
director
squires
dorn
voice
said
still
thinned
by
pain
but
oddly
triumphant
became
a
victim
of
his
own
pointless
vindictiveness
it
was
a
mistake
which
i
am
certain
no
member
of
the
machine
will
care
to
repeat
otherwise
this
incident
has
merely
served
to
confirm
that
the
mars
convicts
operate
under
definite
limitations
they
kill
us
but
ca
afford
to
do
it
if
they
are
to
thrive
in
space
they
need
earth
and
earth
resources
they
are
aware
that
if
the
leadership
dies
earth
will
lapse
into
utter
anarchy
and
turn
its
tremendous
weapons
upon
itself
the
mars
convicts
could
gain
nothing
from
a
ruined
and
depopulated
planet
therefore
the
situation
as
it
stands
remains
a
draw
we
shall
devote
every
effort
to
turn
it
into
a
victory
for
us
the
agreement
we
come
to
eventually
with
the
mars
convicts
will
be
on
our
terms
and
there
is
essentially
nothing
they
or
this
man
with
all
his
powers
can
do
to
prevent
it
the
missionary
of
oneness
swung
his
bronzed
legs
over
the
side
of
the
hammock
and
sat
up
with
an
expression
of
great
interest
he
watched
spokesman
dorn
coming
across
the
sun
room
towards
him
from
the
entrance
corridor
of
his
hospital
suite
it
was
the
first
visit
he
had
from
any
member
of
the
organization
of
the
machine
in
the
two
years
he
had
been
confined
here
for
spokesman
dorn
it
had
been
to
judge
by
his
appearance
a
strenuous
two
years
he
had
lost
weight
and
there
were
dark
smudges
of
fatigue
under
his
eyes
at
the
moment
however
his
face
appeared
relaxed
it
might
have
been
the
relaxation
a
man
feels
who
has
been
emptied
out
by
a
hard
stint
of
work
but
knows
he
has
accomplished
everything
that
could
possibly
have
been
done
dorn
came
to
a
stop
a
dozen
feet
from
the
hammock
for
some
seconds
the
two
men
regarded
each
other
without
speaking
on
my
way
here
dorn
remarked
then
i
was
wondering
whether
you
might
already
know
what
i
come
to
tell
you
rainbolt
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
think
i
could
guess
what
it
is
i
pick
up
generalized
impressions
from
outside
but
i
do
really
know
spokesman
dorn
considered
that
a
moment
chewing
his
lower
lip
reflectively
then
he
shrugged
so
actual
does
happen
to
be
one
of
your
talents
he
said
i
was
rather
sure
of
that
though
others
had
a
different
opinion
of
course
considering
what
you
are
able
to
do
it
really
make
much
difference
well
this
morning
we
sent
out
a
general
call
by
space
radio
to
any
mars
convict
ships
which
might
be
in
the
solar
system
to
come
in
the
call
was
answered
earth
defense
fields
have
been
shut
down
and
the
first
ftl
ships
will
land
within
an
hour
for
what
purpose
rainbolt
said
curiously
there
a
strong
popular
feeling
spokesman
dorn
said
that
your
colleagues
should
take
part
in
deciding
what
pattern
earth
permanent
form
of
government
will
take
in
recent
months
we
handled
things
in
a
rather
provisional
and
haphazard
manner
but
the
situation
is
straightened
out
well
enough
now
to
permit
giving
attention
to
such
legalistic
details
incidentally
you
will
naturally
be
free
to
leave
when
i
do
transportation
is
available
for
you
if
you
wish
to
welcome
your
friends
at
the
spaceport
thank
you
said
rainbolt
i
believe
i
will
spokesman
dorn
shrugged
what
could
we
do
he
said
almost
disinterestedly
you
never
slept
in
the
beginning
you
were
drugged
a
number
of
times
as
you
probably
know
but
we
soon
discovered
that
drugging
you
seemed
to
make
no
difference
at
all
it
does
rainbolt
agreed
day
after
day
dorn
went
on
we
find
thoughts
and
inclinations
coming
into
our
minds
we
never
wanted
there
it
was
an
eerie
experience
though
personally
i
found
it
even
more
disconcerting
to
awaken
in
the
morning
and
discover
that
my
attitudes
had
changed
in
some
particular
or
other
and
as
a
rule
changed
irrevocably
rainbolt
said
in
a
sense
those
were
really
your
attitudes
you
know
they
were
results
of
the
conditioning
of
the
machine
it
was
the
conditioning
i
was
undermining
perhaps
it
was
that
dorn
said
it
seems
to
make
very
little
difference
now
he
paused
frowned
when
the
first
talk
of
initiating
change
began
in
the
councils
there
were
numerous
executions
i
know
now
that
we
were
badly
frightened
men
then
those
of
us
who
had
ordered
the
executions
found
themselves
wanting
similar
changes
presently
we
had
a
majority
and
the
changes
began
to
be
brought
about
reforms
you
would
call
them
and
reforms
i
suppose
they
actually
were
there
was
considerable
general
disturbance
of
course
but
we
retained
the
organization
to
keep
that
within
reasonable
bounds
we
expected
that
you
would
rainbolt
said
it
has
really
been
too
bad
spokesman
dorn
said
reflectively
it
was
simply
an
extraordinary
amount
of
work
to
change
the
structure
of
things
that
had
been
imposed
on
earth
by
the
machine
for
the
past
century
and
a
half
and
the
curious
part
of
it
is
you
know
that
now
it
done
we
do
even
feel
resentment
we
actually
would
want
to
go
back
to
what
we
had
before
you
obtained
an
incredible
hold
on
our
minds
and
frankly
i
expect
that
when
at
last
you
do
relinquish
your
control
we
commit
suicide
or
go
mad
rainbolt
shook
his
head
there
been
just
one
mistake
in
what
said
he
remarked
spokesman
dorn
looked
at
him
with
tired
eyes
what
that
he
asked
i
said
i
was
undermining
the
conditioning
of
the
machine
i
did
and
after
that
i
did
nothing
you
people
simply
have
been
doing
what
most
of
you
always
would
have
preferred
to
do
spokesman
i
relinquished
control
of
the
last
of
you
over
six
months
ago
