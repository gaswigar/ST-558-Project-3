chapter
one
a
little
dinner
with
lucullus
fyshe
the
mausoleum
club
stands
on
the
quietest
corner
of
the
best
residential
street
in
the
city
it
is
a
grecian
building
of
white
stone
about
it
are
great
elm
trees
with
birds
the
most
expensive
kind
of
birds
singing
in
the
branches
the
street
in
the
softer
hours
of
the
morning
has
an
almost
reverential
quiet
great
motors
move
drowsily
along
it
with
solitary
chauffeurs
returning
at
after
conveying
the
earlier
of
the
millionaires
to
their
downtown
offices
the
sunlight
flickers
through
the
elm
trees
illuminating
expensive
wheeling
valuable
children
in
little
perambulators
some
of
the
children
are
worth
millions
and
millions
in
europe
no
doubt
you
may
see
in
the
unter
den
linden
avenue
or
the
champs
elysees
a
little
prince
or
princess
go
past
with
a
clattering
military
guard
of
honour
but
that
is
nothing
it
is
not
half
so
impressive
in
the
real
sense
as
what
you
may
observe
every
morning
on
plutoria
avenue
beside
the
mausoleum
club
in
the
quietest
part
of
the
city
here
you
may
see
a
little
toddling
princess
in
a
rabbit
suit
who
owns
fifty
distilleries
in
her
own
right
there
in
a
lacquered
perambulator
sails
past
a
little
hooded
head
that
controls
from
its
cradle
an
entire
new
jersey
corporation
the
united
states
is
suing
her
as
she
sits
in
a
vain
attempt
to
make
her
dissolve
herself
into
constituent
companies
near
by
is
a
child
of
four
in
a
khaki
suit
who
represents
the
merger
of
two
railways
you
may
meet
in
the
flickered
sunlight
any
number
of
little
princes
and
princesses
far
more
real
than
the
poor
survivals
of
europe
incalculable
infants
wave
their
ivory
rattles
in
an
inarticulate
greeting
to
one
another
a
million
dollars
of
preferred
stock
laughs
merrily
in
recognition
of
a
majority
control
going
past
in
a
drawn
by
an
imported
nurse
and
through
it
all
the
sunlight
falls
through
the
elm
trees
and
the
birds
sing
and
the
motors
hum
so
that
the
whole
world
as
seen
from
the
boulevard
of
plutoria
avenue
is
the
very
pleasantest
place
imaginable
just
below
plutoria
avenue
and
parallel
with
it
the
trees
die
out
and
the
brick
and
stone
of
the
city
begins
in
earnest
even
from
the
avenue
you
see
the
tops
of
the
buildings
in
the
big
commercial
streets
and
can
hear
or
almost
hear
the
roar
of
the
elevated
railway
earning
dividends
and
beyond
that
again
the
city
sinks
lower
and
is
choked
and
crowded
with
the
tangled
streets
and
little
houses
of
the
slums
in
fact
if
you
were
to
mount
to
the
roof
of
the
mausoleum
club
itself
on
plutoria
avenue
you
could
almost
see
the
slums
from
there
but
why
should
you
and
on
the
other
hand
if
you
never
went
up
on
the
roof
but
only
dined
inside
among
the
palm
trees
you
would
never
know
that
the
slums
existed
which
is
much
better
there
are
broad
steps
leading
up
to
the
club
so
broad
and
so
agreeably
covered
with
matting
that
the
physical
exertion
of
lifting
oneself
from
one
motor
to
the
door
of
the
club
is
reduced
to
the
smallest
compass
the
richer
members
are
not
ashamed
to
take
the
steps
one
at
a
time
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
and
at
tight
money
periods
when
there
is
a
black
cloud
hanging
over
the
stock
exchange
you
may
see
each
and
every
one
of
the
members
of
the
mausoleum
club
dragging
himself
up
the
steps
after
this
fashion
his
restless
eyes
filled
with
the
dumb
pathos
of
a
man
wondering
where
he
can
put
his
hand
on
half
a
million
dollars
but
at
gayer
times
when
there
are
gala
receptions
at
the
club
its
steps
are
all
buried
under
expensive
carpet
soft
as
moss
and
covered
over
with
a
long
pavilion
of
red
and
white
awning
to
catch
the
snowflakes
and
beautiful
ladies
are
poured
into
the
club
by
the
motorful
then
indeed
it
is
turned
into
a
veritable
arcadia
and
for
a
beautiful
pastoral
scene
such
as
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
a
poet
who
understood
the
cost
of
things
commend
me
to
the
mausoleum
club
on
just
such
an
evening
its
broad
corridors
and
deep
recesses
are
filled
with
shepherdesses
such
as
you
never
saw
dressed
in
beautiful
shimmering
gowns
and
wearing
feathers
in
their
hair
that
droop
off
sideways
at
every
angle
known
to
trigonometry
and
there
are
shepherds
too
with
broad
white
waistcoats
and
little
patent
leather
shoes
and
heavy
faces
and
congested
cheeks
and
there
is
dancing
and
conversation
among
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
with
such
brilliant
flashes
of
wit
and
repartee
about
the
rise
in
wabash
and
the
fall
in
cement
that
the
soul
of
louis
quatorze
would
leap
to
hear
it
and
later
there
is
supper
at
little
tables
when
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
consume
preferred
stocks
and
bonds
in
the
shape
of
chilled
champagne
and
iced
asparagus
and
great
platefuls
of
dividends
and
special
quarterly
bonuses
are
carried
to
and
fro
in
silver
dishes
by
chinese
philosophers
dressed
up
to
look
like
waiters
but
on
ordinary
days
there
are
no
ladies
in
the
club
but
only
the
shepherds
you
may
see
them
sitting
about
in
little
groups
of
two
and
three
under
the
palm
trees
drinking
whiskey
and
soda
though
of
course
the
more
temperate
among
them
drink
nothing
but
whiskey
and
lithia
water
and
those
who
have
important
business
to
do
in
the
afternoon
limit
themselves
to
whiskey
and
radnor
or
whiskey
and
magi
water
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
bubbling
gurgling
mineral
waters
in
the
caverns
of
the
mausoleum
club
as
ever
sparkled
from
the
rocks
of
homeric
greece
and
when
you
have
once
grown
used
to
them
it
is
as
impossible
to
go
back
to
plain
water
as
it
is
to
live
again
in
the
forgotten
house
in
a
side
street
that
you
inhabited
long
before
you
became
a
member
thus
the
members
sit
and
talk
in
undertones
that
float
to
the
ear
through
the
haze
of
havana
smoke
you
may
hear
the
older
men
explaining
that
the
country
is
going
to
absolute
ruin
and
the
younger
ones
explaining
that
the
country
is
forging
ahead
as
it
never
did
before
but
chiefly
they
love
to
talk
of
great
national
questions
such
as
the
protective
tariff
and
the
need
of
raising
it
the
sad
decline
of
the
morality
of
the
working
man
the
spread
of
syndicalism
and
the
lack
of
christianity
in
the
labour
class
and
the
awful
growth
of
selfishness
among
the
mass
of
the
people
so
they
talk
except
for
two
or
three
that
drop
off
to
meetings
till
the
afternoon
fades
and
darkens
into
evening
and
the
noiseless
chinese
philosophers
turn
on
soft
lights
here
and
there
among
the
palm
trees
presently
they
dine
at
white
tables
glittering
with
cut
glass
and
green
and
yellow
rhine
wines
and
after
dinner
they
sit
again
among
the
in
the
blue
smoke
still
talking
of
the
tariff
and
the
labour
class
and
trying
to
wash
away
the
memory
and
the
sadness
of
it
in
floods
of
mineral
waters
so
the
evening
passes
into
night
and
one
by
one
the
great
motors
come
throbbing
to
the
door
and
the
mausoleum
club
empties
and
darkens
till
the
last
member
is
borne
away
and
the
arcadian
day
ends
in
repose
i
want
you
to
give
me
your
opinion
very
very
frankly
said
lucullus
fyshe
on
one
side
of
the
luncheon
table
to
the
rev
fareforth
furlong
on
the
other
by
all
means
said
furlong
fyshe
poured
out
a
wineglassful
of
soda
and
handed
it
to
the
rector
to
drink
now
tell
me
very
truthfully
he
said
is
there
too
much
carbon
in
it
by
no
means
said
furlong
and
quite
frankly
not
too
much
hydrogen
oh
decidedly
not
and
you
would
not
say
that
the
percentage
of
sodium
bicarbonate
was
too
great
for
the
ordinary
taste
i
certainly
should
not
said
furlong
and
in
this
he
spoke
the
truth
very
good
then
said
fyshe
i
shall
use
it
for
the
duke
of
dulham
this
afternoon
he
uttered
the
name
of
the
duke
with
that
quiet
democratic
carelessness
which
meant
that
he
did
care
whether
half
a
dozen
other
members
lunching
at
the
club
could
hear
or
not
after
all
what
was
a
duke
to
a
man
who
was
president
of
the
people
traction
and
suburban
and
the
republican
soda
and
siphon
and
chief
director
of
the
people
district
loan
and
savings
if
a
man
with
a
broad
basis
of
popular
support
like
that
was
proposing
to
entertain
a
duke
surely
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
his
motives
none
at
all
naturally
too
if
a
man
manufactures
soda
himself
he
gets
a
little
about
the
possibility
of
his
guests
noticing
the
existence
of
too
much
carbon
in
it
in
fact
ever
so
many
of
the
members
of
the
mausoleum
club
manufacture
things
or
cause
them
to
be
manufactured
or
what
is
the
same
thing
merge
them
when
they
are
manufactured
this
gives
them
their
peculiar
chemical
attitude
towards
their
food
one
often
sees
a
member
suddenly
call
the
head
waiter
at
breakfast
to
tell
him
that
there
is
too
much
ammonia
in
the
bacon
and
another
one
protest
at
the
amount
of
glucose
in
the
olive
oil
and
another
that
there
is
too
high
a
percentage
of
nitrogen
in
the
anchovy
a
man
of
distorted
imagination
might
think
this
tasting
of
chemicals
in
the
food
a
sort
of
nemesis
of
fate
upon
the
members
but
that
would
be
very
foolish
for
in
every
case
the
head
waiter
who
is
the
chief
of
the
chinese
philosophers
mentioned
above
says
that
he
see
to
it
immediately
and
have
the
percentage
removed
and
as
for
the
members
themselves
they
are
about
as
much
ashamed
of
manufacturing
and
merging
things
as
the
marquis
of
salisbury
is
ashamed
of
the
founders
of
the
cecil
family
what
more
natural
therefore
than
that
lucullus
fyshe
before
serving
the
soda
to
the
duke
should
try
it
on
somebody
else
and
what
better
person
could
be
found
for
this
than
furlong
the
saintly
young
rector
of
asaph
who
had
enjoyed
the
kind
of
expensive
college
education
calculated
to
develop
all
the
faculties
moreover
a
rector
of
the
anglican
church
who
has
been
in
the
foreign
mission
field
is
the
kind
of
person
from
whom
one
can
find
out
more
or
less
incidentally
how
one
should
address
and
converse
with
a
duke
and
whether
you
call
him
your
grace
or
his
grace
or
just
grace
or
duke
or
what
all
of
which
things
would
seem
to
a
director
of
the
people
bank
and
the
president
of
the
republican
soda
so
trivial
in
importance
that
he
would
scorn
to
ask
about
them
so
that
was
why
fyshe
had
asked
furlong
to
lunch
with
him
and
to
dine
with
him
later
on
in
the
same
day
at
the
mausoleum
club
to
meet
the
duke
of
dulham
and
furlong
realizing
that
a
clergyman
must
be
all
things
to
all
men
and
not
avoid
a
man
merely
because
he
is
a
duke
had
accepted
the
invitation
to
lunch
and
had
promised
to
come
to
dinner
even
though
it
meant
postponing
the
willing
workers
tango
class
of
asaph
until
the
following
friday
thus
it
had
come
about
that
fyshe
was
seated
at
lunch
consuming
a
cutlet
and
a
pint
of
moselle
in
the
plain
downright
fashion
of
a
man
so
democratic
that
he
is
practically
a
revolutionary
socialist
and
does
mind
saying
so
and
the
young
rector
of
asaph
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
in
a
religious
ecstasy
over
a
of
duck
the
duke
arrived
this
morning
did
he
not
said
furlong
from
new
york
said
fyshe
he
is
staying
at
the
grand
palaver
i
sent
a
telegram
through
one
of
our
new
york
directors
of
the
traction
and
his
grace
has
very
kindly
promised
to
come
over
here
to
dine
is
he
here
for
pleasure
asked
the
rector
i
understand
he
is
fyshe
was
going
to
say
about
to
invest
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
in
american
securities
but
he
thought
better
of
it
even
with
the
clergy
it
is
well
to
be
careful
so
he
substituted
is
very
much
interested
in
studying
american
conditions
does
he
stay
long
asked
furlong
had
lucullus
fyshe
replied
quite
truthfully
he
would
have
said
not
if
i
can
get
his
money
out
of
him
quickly
but
he
merely
answered
that
i
do
know
he
will
find
much
to
interest
him
went
on
the
rector
in
a
musing
tone
the
position
of
the
anglican
church
in
america
should
afford
him
an
object
of
much
consideration
i
understand
he
added
feeling
his
way
that
his
grace
is
a
man
of
deep
piety
very
deep
said
fyshe
and
of
great
philanthropy
very
great
and
i
presume
said
the
rector
taking
a
devout
sip
of
the
unfinished
soda
that
he
is
a
man
of
immense
wealth
i
suppose
so
answered
fyshe
quite
carelessly
all
these
fellows
are
fyshe
generally
referred
to
the
british
aristocracy
as
these
fellows
land
you
know
feudal
estates
sheer
robbery
i
call
it
how
the
the
proletariat
stand
for
such
tyranny
is
more
than
i
can
see
mark
my
words
furlong
some
day
they
rise
and
the
whole
thing
will
come
to
a
sudden
end
fyshe
was
here
launched
upon
his
favourite
topic
but
he
interrupted
himself
just
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
the
waiter
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
he
said
by
serving
asparagus
very
sorry
sir
said
the
waiter
shall
i
take
it
out
take
it
out
of
course
take
it
out
and
see
that
you
do
serve
me
stuff
of
that
sort
again
or
i
report
you
very
sorry
sir
said
the
waiter
fyshe
looked
at
the
vanishing
waiter
with
contempt
upon
his
features
these
pampered
fellows
are
getting
unbearable
he
said
by
gad
if
i
had
my
way
i
fire
the
whole
lot
of
them
lock
out
put
on
the
street
that
would
teach
yes
furlong
you
live
to
see
it
that
the
whole
will
one
day
rise
against
the
tyranny
of
the
upper
classes
and
society
will
be
overwhelmed
but
if
fyshe
had
realized
that
at
that
moment
in
the
kitchen
of
the
mausoleum
club
in
those
sacred
precincts
themselves
there
was
a
walking
delegate
of
the
waiters
international
union
leaning
against
a
sideboard
with
his
bowler
hat
over
one
corner
of
his
eye
and
talking
to
a
little
group
of
the
chinese
philosophers
he
would
have
known
that
perhaps
the
social
catastrophe
was
a
little
nearer
than
even
he
suspected
are
you
inviting
anyone
else
tonight
asked
furlong
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
your
father
said
fyshe
but
unfortunately
he
is
out
of
town
what
fyshe
really
meant
was
i
am
extremely
glad
not
to
have
to
ask
your
father
whom
i
would
not
introduce
to
the
duke
on
any
account
indeed
furlong
senior
the
father
of
the
rector
of
asaph
who
was
president
of
the
new
amalgamated
hymnal
corporation
and
director
of
the
hosanna
pipe
and
steam
organ
limited
was
entirely
the
wrong
man
for
fyshe
present
purpose
in
fact
he
was
reputed
to
be
as
smart
a
man
as
ever
sold
a
bible
at
this
moment
he
was
out
of
town
busied
in
new
york
with
the
preparation
of
the
plates
of
his
new
hindu
testament
copyright
but
had
he
learned
that
a
duke
with
several
millions
to
invest
was
about
to
visit
the
city
he
would
not
have
left
it
for
the
whole
of
hindustan
i
suppose
you
are
asking
boulder
said
the
rector
no
answered
fyshe
very
decidedly
dismissing
the
name
absolutely
indeed
there
was
even
better
reason
not
to
introduce
boulder
to
the
duke
fyshe
had
made
that
sort
of
mistake
once
and
never
intended
to
make
it
again
it
was
only
a
year
ago
on
the
occasion
of
the
visit
of
young
viscount
fitzthistle
to
the
mausoleum
club
that
fyshe
had
introduced
boulder
to
the
viscount
and
had
suffered
grievously
thereby
for
boulder
had
no
sooner
met
the
viscount
than
he
invited
him
up
to
his
in
wisconsin
and
that
was
the
last
thing
known
of
the
investment
of
the
fitzthistle
fortune
this
boulder
of
whom
fyshe
spoke
might
indeed
have
been
seen
at
that
moment
at
a
further
table
of
the
lunch
room
eating
a
solitary
meal
an
oldish
man
with
a
great
frame
suggesting
broken
strength
with
a
white
beard
and
with
falling
that
made
him
look
as
if
he
were
just
about
to
cry
his
eyes
were
blue
and
far
away
and
his
still
mournful
face
and
his
great
bent
shoulders
seemed
to
suggest
all
the
power
and
mystery
of
high
finance
gloom
indeed
hung
over
him
for
when
one
heard
him
talk
of
listed
stocks
and
cumulative
dividends
there
was
as
deep
a
tone
in
his
quiet
voice
as
if
he
spoke
of
eternal
punishment
and
the
wages
of
sin
under
his
great
hands
a
chattering
viscount
or
a
sturdy
duke
or
a
popinjay
italian
marquis
was
as
nothing
boulder
methods
with
titled
visitors
investing
money
in
america
were
deep
he
never
spoke
to
them
of
money
not
a
word
he
merely
talked
of
the
great
american
forest
he
had
been
born
years
back
in
a
lumber
state
and
when
he
spoke
of
primeval
trees
and
the
howl
of
the
wolf
at
night
among
the
pines
there
was
the
stamp
of
reality
about
it
that
held
the
visitor
spellbound
and
when
he
fell
to
talking
of
his
far
away
in
the
wisconsin
timber
duke
earl
or
baron
that
had
ever
handled
a
express
rifle
listened
and
was
lost
i
have
a
little
place
boulder
would
say
in
his
deep
tones
that
seemed
almost
like
a
sob
a
sort
of
shooting
box
i
think
you
call
it
up
in
wisconsin
just
a
plain
place
he
would
add
almost
crying
made
of
logs
oh
really
the
visitor
would
interject
made
of
logs
by
jove
how
interesting
all
titled
people
are
fascinated
at
once
with
logs
and
boulder
knew
it
at
least
subconsciously
yes
logs
he
would
continue
still
in
deep
sorrow
just
the
plain
cedar
not
squared
you
know
the
old
original
timber
i
had
them
cut
right
out
of
the
forest
by
this
time
the
visitor
excitement
was
obvious
and
is
there
game
there
he
would
ask
we
have
the
said
boulder
his
voice
half
choking
at
the
sadness
of
the
thing
and
of
course
the
jack
wolf
and
the
lynx
and
are
they
ferocious
oh
extremely
so
quite
uncontrollable
on
which
the
titled
visitor
was
all
excitement
to
start
for
wisconsin
at
once
even
before
boulder
invitation
was
put
in
words
and
when
he
returned
a
week
later
all
tanned
and
wearing
boots
and
covered
with
wolf
bites
his
whole
available
fortune
was
so
completely
invested
in
boulder
securities
that
you
could
have
shaken
cents
out
of
him
upside
down
yet
the
whole
thing
had
been
done
merely
incidentally
round
a
big
fire
under
the
wisconsin
timber
with
a
dead
wolf
or
two
lying
in
the
snow
so
no
wonder
that
fyshe
did
not
propose
to
invite
boulder
to
his
little
dinner
no
indeed
in
fact
his
one
aim
was
to
keep
boulder
and
his
log
house
hidden
from
the
duke
and
equally
no
wonder
that
as
soon
as
boulder
read
of
the
arrival
in
new
york
and
saw
by
the
echo
and
financial
that
he
might
come
to
the
city
looking
for
investments
he
telephoned
at
once
to
his
little
place
in
wisconsin
which
had
of
course
a
primeval
telephone
wire
running
to
it
and
told
his
steward
to
have
the
place
well
aired
and
good
fires
lighted
and
he
especially
enjoined
him
to
see
if
any
of
the
shanty
men
thereabouts
could
catch
a
wolf
or
two
as
he
might
need
them
is
no
one
else
coming
then
asked
the
rector
oh
yes
president
boomer
of
the
university
we
shall
be
a
party
of
four
i
thought
the
duke
might
be
interested
in
meeting
boomer
he
may
care
to
hear
something
of
the
archaeological
remains
of
the
continent
if
the
duke
did
so
care
he
certainly
had
a
splendid
chance
in
meeting
the
gigantic
boomer
the
president
of
plutoria
university
if
he
wanted
to
know
anything
of
the
exact
distinction
between
the
mexican
pueblo
and
the
navajo
tribal
house
he
had
his
opportunity
right
now
if
he
was
eager
to
hear
a
short
talk
say
half
an
hour
on
the
relative
antiquity
of
the
neanderthal
skull
and
the
gravel
deposits
of
the
missouri
his
chance
had
come
he
could
learn
as
much
about
the
stone
age
and
the
bronze
age
in
america
from
president
boomer
as
he
could
about
the
gold
age
and
the
age
of
paper
securities
from
fyshe
and
boulder
so
what
better
man
to
meet
a
duke
than
an
archaeological
president
and
if
the
duke
should
feel
inclined
as
a
result
of
his
american
visit
for
boomer
who
knew
everything
understood
what
the
duke
had
come
for
inclined
let
us
say
to
endow
a
chair
in
primitive
anthropology
or
do
any
useful
little
thing
of
the
sort
that
was
only
fair
business
all
round
or
if
he
even
was
willing
to
give
a
moderate
sum
towards
the
general
fund
of
plutoria
university
enough
let
us
say
to
enable
the
president
to
dismiss
an
old
professor
and
hire
a
new
one
that
surely
was
reasonable
enough
the
president
therefore
had
said
yes
to
fyshe
invitation
with
alacrity
and
had
taken
a
look
through
the
list
of
his
more
incompetent
professors
to
refresh
his
memory
the
duke
of
dulham
had
landed
in
new
york
five
days
before
and
had
looked
round
eagerly
for
a
field
of
turnips
but
had
seen
any
he
had
been
driven
up
fifth
avenue
and
had
kept
his
eyes
open
for
potatoes
but
there
were
none
nor
had
he
seen
any
shorthorns
in
central
park
nor
any
southdowns
on
broadway
for
the
duke
of
course
like
all
dukes
was
agricultural
from
his
norfolk
jacket
to
his
hobnailed
boots
at
his
restaurant
he
had
cut
a
potato
in
two
and
sent
half
of
it
to
the
head
waiter
to
know
if
it
was
bermudian
it
had
all
the
look
of
an
early
bermudian
but
the
duke
feared
from
the
shading
of
it
that
it
might
be
only
a
late
trinidad
and
the
head
waiter
sent
it
to
the
chef
mistaking
it
for
a
complaint
and
the
chef
sent
it
back
to
the
duke
with
a
message
that
it
was
not
a
bermudian
but
a
prince
edward
island
and
the
duke
sent
his
compliments
to
the
chef
and
the
chef
sent
his
compliments
to
the
duke
and
the
duke
was
so
pleased
at
learning
this
that
he
had
a
similar
potato
wrapped
up
for
him
to
take
away
and
tipped
the
head
waiter
cents
feeling
that
in
an
extravagant
country
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
the
people
one
better
so
the
duke
carried
the
potato
round
for
five
days
in
new
york
and
showed
it
to
everybody
but
beyond
this
he
got
no
sign
of
agriculture
out
of
the
place
at
all
no
one
who
entertained
him
seemed
to
know
what
the
beef
that
they
gave
him
had
been
fed
on
no
one
even
in
what
seemed
the
best
society
could
talk
rationally
about
preparing
a
hog
for
the
breakfast
table
people
seemed
to
eat
cauliflower
without
distinguishing
the
denmark
variety
from
the
oldenburg
and
few
if
any
knew
silesian
bacon
even
when
they
tasted
it
and
when
they
took
the
duke
out
miles
into
what
was
called
the
country
there
were
still
no
turnips
but
only
real
estate
and
railway
embankments
and
advertising
signs
so
that
altogether
the
obvious
and
visible
decline
of
american
agriculture
in
what
should
have
been
its
leading
centre
saddened
the
duke
heart
thus
the
duke
passed
four
gloomy
days
agriculture
vexed
him
and
still
more
of
course
the
money
concerns
which
had
brought
him
to
america
money
is
a
troublesome
thing
but
it
has
got
to
be
thought
about
even
by
those
who
were
not
brought
up
to
it
if
on
account
of
money
matters
one
has
been
driven
to
come
over
to
america
in
the
hope
of
borrowing
money
the
awkwardness
of
how
to
go
about
it
naturally
makes
one
gloomy
and
preoccupied
had
there
been
broad
fields
of
turnips
to
walk
in
and
holstein
cattle
to
punch
in
the
ribs
one
might
have
managed
to
borrow
it
in
the
course
of
gentlemanly
intercourse
as
from
one
to
another
but
in
new
york
amid
piles
of
masonry
and
roaring
and
glittering
lunches
and
palatial
residences
one
simply
could
do
it
herein
lay
the
truth
about
the
duke
of
dulham
visit
and
the
error
of
lucullus
fyshe
fyshe
was
thinking
that
the
duke
had
come
to
money
in
reality
he
had
come
to
it
in
fact
the
duke
was
reckoning
that
by
putting
a
second
mortgage
on
dulham
towers
for
twenty
thousand
sterling
and
by
selling
his
scotch
shooting
and
leasing
his
irish
grazing
and
his
welsh
coal
rent
he
could
raise
altogether
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
this
for
a
duke
is
an
enormous
sum
if
he
once
had
it
he
would
be
able
to
pay
off
the
first
mortgage
on
dulham
towers
buy
in
the
rights
of
the
present
tenant
of
the
scotch
shooting
and
the
claim
of
the
present
mortgagee
of
the
irish
grazing
and
in
fact
be
just
where
he
started
this
is
ducal
finance
which
moves
always
in
a
circle
in
other
words
the
duke
was
really
a
poor
man
not
poor
in
the
american
sense
where
poverty
comes
as
a
sudden
blighting
stringency
taking
the
form
of
an
inability
to
get
hold
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
no
matter
how
badly
one
needs
it
and
where
it
passes
like
a
and
is
gone
but
poor
in
that
permanent
and
distressing
sense
known
only
to
the
british
aristocracy
the
duke
case
of
course
was
notorious
and
fyshe
ought
to
have
known
of
it
the
duke
was
so
poor
that
the
duchess
was
compelled
to
spend
three
or
four
months
every
year
at
a
fashionable
hotel
on
the
riviera
simply
to
save
money
and
his
eldest
son
the
young
marquis
of
beldoodle
had
to
put
in
most
of
his
time
shooting
big
game
in
uganda
with
only
twenty
or
beaters
and
with
so
few
carriers
and
couriers
and
such
a
dearth
of
elephant
men
and
hyena
boys
that
the
thing
was
a
perfect
scandal
the
duke
indeed
was
so
poor
that
a
younger
son
simply
to
add
his
efforts
to
those
of
the
rest
was
compelled
to
pass
his
days
in
mountain
climbing
in
the
himalayas
and
the
duke
daughter
was
obliged
to
pay
long
visits
to
minor
german
princesses
putting
up
with
all
sorts
of
hardship
and
while
the
ducal
family
wandered
about
in
this
way
climbing
mountains
and
shooting
hyenas
and
saving
money
the
duke
place
or
seat
dulham
towers
was
practically
shut
up
with
no
one
in
it
but
servants
and
housekeepers
and
gamekeepers
and
tourists
and
the
picture
galleries
except
for
artists
and
visitors
and
villagers
were
closed
and
the
town
house
except
for
the
presence
of
servants
and
tradesmen
and
secretaries
was
absolutely
shut
but
the
duke
knew
that
rigid
parsimony
of
this
sort
if
kept
up
for
a
generation
or
two
will
work
wonders
and
this
sustained
him
and
the
duchess
knew
it
and
it
sustained
her
in
fact
all
the
ducal
family
knowing
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
generation
or
two
took
their
misfortune
very
cheerfully
the
only
thing
that
bothered
the
duke
was
borrowing
money
this
was
necessary
from
time
to
time
when
loans
or
mortgages
fell
in
but
he
hated
it
it
was
beneath
him
his
ancestors
had
often
taken
money
but
had
never
borrowed
it
and
the
duke
chafed
under
the
necessity
there
was
something
about
the
process
that
went
against
the
grain
to
sit
down
in
pleasant
converse
with
a
man
perhaps
almost
a
gentleman
and
then
lead
up
to
the
subject
and
take
his
money
from
him
seemed
to
the
duke
mind
essentially
low
he
could
have
understood
knocking
a
man
over
the
head
with
a
fire
shovel
and
taking
his
money
but
not
borrowing
it
so
the
duke
had
come
to
america
where
borrowing
is
notoriously
easy
any
member
of
the
mausoleum
club
for
instance
would
borrow
fifty
cents
to
buy
a
cigar
or
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
buy
a
house
or
five
millions
to
buy
a
railroad
with
complete
indifference
and
pay
it
back
too
if
he
could
and
think
nothing
of
it
in
fact
ever
so
many
of
the
duke
friends
were
known
to
have
borrowed
money
in
america
with
magical
ease
pledging
for
it
their
seats
or
their
pictures
or
one
of
their
daughters
anything
so
the
duke
knew
it
must
be
easy
and
yet
incredible
as
it
may
seem
he
had
spent
four
days
in
new
york
entertained
everywhere
and
made
much
of
and
had
borrowed
a
cent
he
had
been
asked
to
lunch
in
a
riverside
palace
and
fool
that
he
was
had
come
away
without
so
much
as
a
dollar
to
show
for
it
he
had
been
asked
to
a
country
house
on
the
hudson
and
like
an
idiot
he
admitted
it
himself
had
asked
his
host
for
as
much
as
his
train
fare
he
had
been
driven
twice
round
central
park
in
a
motor
and
had
been
taken
tamely
back
to
his
hotel
not
a
dollar
the
richer
the
thing
was
childish
and
he
knew
it
but
to
save
his
life
the
duke
did
know
how
to
begin
none
of
the
things
that
he
was
able
to
talk
about
seemed
to
have
the
remotest
connection
with
the
subject
of
money
the
duke
was
able
to
converse
reasonably
well
over
such
topics
as
the
approaching
downfall
of
england
they
had
talked
of
it
at
dulham
towers
for
sixty
years
or
over
the
duty
of
england
towards
china
or
the
duty
of
england
to
persia
or
its
duty
to
aid
the
young
turk
movement
and
its
duty
to
check
the
old
servia
agitation
the
duke
became
so
interested
in
these
topics
and
in
explaining
that
while
he
had
never
been
a
little
englander
he
had
always
been
a
big
turk
and
that
he
stood
for
a
small
bulgaria
and
a
restricted
austria
that
he
got
further
and
further
away
from
the
topic
of
money
which
was
what
he
really
wanted
to
come
to
and
the
duke
rose
from
his
conversations
with
a
look
of
such
obvious
distress
on
his
face
that
everybody
realized
that
his
anxiety
about
england
was
killing
him
and
then
suddenly
light
had
come
it
was
on
his
fourth
day
in
new
york
that
he
unexpectedly
ran
into
the
viscount
belstairs
they
had
been
together
as
young
men
in
nigeria
and
as
men
in
petersburg
and
belstairs
who
was
in
abundant
spirits
and
who
was
returning
to
england
on
the
at
noon
the
next
day
explained
to
the
duke
that
he
had
just
borrowed
fifty
thousand
pounds
on
security
that
would
be
worth
a
halfpenny
in
england
and
the
duke
said
with
a
sigh
how
the
deuce
do
you
do
it
belstairs
do
what
borrow
it
said
the
duke
how
do
you
manage
to
get
people
to
talk
about
it
here
i
am
wanting
to
borrow
a
hundred
thousand
and
hanged
if
i
can
even
find
an
opening
at
which
the
viscount
had
said
pooh
pooh
you
do
need
any
opening
just
borrow
it
straight
out
ask
for
it
across
a
dinner
table
just
as
you
ask
for
a
match
they
think
nothing
of
it
here
across
the
dinner
table
repeated
the
duke
who
was
a
literal
man
certainly
said
the
viscount
not
too
soon
you
know
say
after
a
second
glass
of
wine
i
assure
you
it
absolutely
nothing
and
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
a
telegram
was
handed
to
the
duke
from
lucullus
fyshe
praying
him
as
he
was
reported
to
be
visiting
the
next
day
the
city
where
the
mausoleum
club
stands
to
make
acquaintance
with
him
by
dining
at
that
institution
and
the
duke
being
as
i
say
a
literal
man
decided
that
just
as
soon
as
fyshe
should
give
him
a
second
glass
of
wine
that
second
glass
should
cost
fyshe
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
oddly
enough
at
about
the
same
moment
fyshe
was
calculating
that
provided
he
could
make
the
duke
drink
a
second
glass
of
the
mausoleum
champagne
that
glass
would
cost
the
duke
about
five
million
dollars
so
the
very
morning
after
that
the
duke
had
arrived
on
the
new
york
express
in
the
city
and
being
an
ordinary
democratic
commercial
sort
of
place
absorbed
in
its
own
affairs
it
made
no
fuss
over
him
whatever
the
morning
edition
of
the
simply
said
we
understand
that
the
duke
of
dulham
arrives
at
the
grand
palaver
this
morning
after
which
it
traced
the
duke
pedigree
back
to
jock
of
ealing
in
the
twelfth
century
and
let
the
matter
go
at
that
and
the
noon
edition
of
the
merely
wrote
we
learn
that
duke
dulham
is
in
town
he
is
a
relation
of
jack
ealing
but
the
echo
and
financial
appearing
at
four
printed
in
its
columns
the
announcement
we
understand
that
the
duke
of
dulham
who
arrives
in
town
today
is
proposing
to
invest
a
large
sum
of
money
in
american
industrials
and
of
course
that
announcement
reached
every
member
of
the
mausoleum
club
within
twenty
minutes
the
duke
of
dulham
entered
the
mausoleum
club
that
evening
at
exactly
seven
of
the
clock
he
was
a
short
thick
man
with
a
shaven
face
red
as
a
brick
and
grizzled
hair
and
from
the
look
of
him
he
could
have
got
a
job
at
sight
in
any
lumber
camp
in
wisconsin
he
wore
a
dinner
jacket
just
like
an
ordinary
person
but
even
without
his
norfolk
coat
and
his
hobnailed
boots
there
was
something
in
the
way
in
which
he
walked
up
the
long
main
hall
of
the
mausoleum
club
that
every
imported
waiter
in
the
place
recognized
in
an
instant
the
duke
cast
his
eye
about
the
club
and
approved
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
a
modest
quiet
place
very
different
from
the
staring
ostentation
that
one
sees
too
often
in
a
german
hof
or
an
italian
palazzo
he
liked
it
fyshe
and
furlong
were
standing
in
a
deep
alcove
or
bay
where
there
was
a
fire
and
trees
and
pictures
with
shaded
lights
and
a
table
there
the
duke
joined
them
fyshe
he
had
met
already
that
afternoon
at
the
palaver
and
he
called
him
fyshe
as
if
he
had
known
him
forever
and
indeed
after
a
few
minutes
he
called
the
rector
of
asaph
simply
furlong
for
he
had
been
familiar
with
the
anglican
clergy
in
so
many
parts
of
the
world
that
he
knew
that
to
attribute
any
peculiar
godliness
to
them
socially
was
the
worst
possible
taste
by
jove
said
the
duke
turning
to
tap
the
leaf
of
a
rubber
tree
with
his
finger
that
fellow
a
nigerian
is
he
i
hardly
know
said
fyshe
i
imagine
so
and
he
added
been
in
nigeria
duke
oh
some
years
ago
said
the
duke
after
big
game
you
know
fine
place
for
it
did
you
get
any
asked
fyshe
not
much
said
the
duke
a
hippo
or
two
ah
said
fyshe
and
of
course
now
and
then
a
giro
the
duke
went
on
and
added
my
sister
was
luckier
though
she
potted
a
rhino
one
day
straight
out
of
a
doolie
i
call
that
rather
good
fyshe
called
it
that
too
ah
now
here
a
good
thing
the
duke
went
on
looking
at
a
picture
he
carried
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
an
eyeglass
that
he
used
for
pictures
and
for
tamworth
hogs
and
he
put
it
to
his
eye
with
one
hand
keeping
the
other
in
the
left
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
this
this
is
a
very
good
thing
i
believe
so
said
fyshe
you
really
have
some
awfully
good
things
here
continued
the
duke
he
had
seen
far
too
many
pictures
in
too
many
places
ever
to
speak
of
values
or
compositions
or
anything
of
that
sort
the
duke
merely
looked
at
a
picture
and
said
now
here
a
good
thing
or
ah
here
now
is
a
very
good
thing
or
i
say
here
a
really
good
thing
no
one
could
get
past
this
sort
of
criticism
the
duke
had
long
since
found
it
they
showed
me
some
rather
good
things
in
new
york
he
went
on
but
really
the
things
you
have
here
seem
to
be
awfully
good
things
indeed
the
duke
was
truly
pleased
with
the
pictures
for
something
in
their
composition
or
else
in
the
soft
expensive
light
that
shone
on
them
enabled
him
to
see
in
the
distant
background
of
each
a
hundred
thousand
sterling
and
that
is
a
very
beautiful
picture
indeed
when
you
come
to
our
side
of
the
water
fyshe
said
the
duke
i
must
show
you
my
botticelli
had
fyshe
who
knew
nothing
of
art
expressed
his
real
thought
he
would
have
said
show
me
your
which
but
he
only
answered
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
it
in
any
case
there
was
no
time
to
say
more
for
at
this
moment
the
portly
figure
and
the
great
face
of
boomer
president
of
plutoria
university
loomed
upon
them
and
with
him
came
a
great
burst
of
conversation
that
blew
all
previous
topics
into
fragments
he
was
introduced
to
the
duke
and
shook
hands
with
furlong
and
talked
to
both
of
them
and
named
the
kind
of
cocktail
that
he
wanted
all
in
one
breath
and
in
the
very
next
he
was
asking
the
duke
about
the
babylonian
hieroglyphic
bricks
that
his
grandfather
the
thirteenth
duke
had
brought
home
from
the
euphrates
and
which
every
archaeologist
knew
were
preserved
in
the
duke
library
at
dulham
towers
and
though
the
duke
had
known
about
the
bricks
himself
he
assured
boomer
that
his
grandfather
had
collected
some
really
good
things
quite
remarkable
and
the
duke
having
met
a
man
who
knew
about
his
grandfather
felt
in
his
own
element
in
fact
he
was
so
delighted
with
boomer
and
the
nigerian
rubber
tree
and
the
shaded
pictures
and
the
charm
of
the
whole
place
and
the
certainty
that
half
a
million
dollars
was
easily
findable
in
it
that
he
put
his
eyeglass
back
in
his
pocket
and
said
a
charming
club
you
have
here
really
most
charming
yes
said
fyshe
in
a
casual
tone
a
comfortable
place
we
like
to
think
but
if
he
could
have
seen
what
was
happening
below
in
the
kitchens
of
the
mausoleum
club
fyshe
would
have
realized
that
just
then
it
was
turning
into
a
most
uncomfortable
place
for
the
walking
delegate
with
his
hat
on
sideways
who
had
haunted
it
all
day
was
busy
now
among
the
assembled
chinese
philosophers
writing
down
names
and
distributing
strikers
cards
of
the
international
union
and
assuring
them
that
the
boys
of
the
grand
palaver
had
all
walked
out
at
seven
and
that
all
the
boys
of
the
commercial
and
the
union
and
of
every
restaurant
in
town
were
out
an
hour
ago
and
the
philosophers
were
taking
their
cards
and
hanging
up
their
waiters
coats
and
putting
on
shabby
jackets
and
bowler
hats
worn
sideways
and
changing
themselves
by
a
wonderful
transformation
from
respectable
chinese
to
slouching
loafers
of
the
lowest
type
but
fyshe
being
in
an
alcove
and
not
in
the
kitchens
saw
nothing
of
these
things
not
even
when
the
head
waiter
shaking
with
apprehension
appeared
with
cocktails
made
by
himself
in
glasses
that
he
himself
had
had
to
wipe
did
fyshe
absorbed
in
the
easy
urbanity
of
the
duke
notice
that
anything
was
amiss
neither
did
his
guests
for
boomer
having
discovered
that
the
duke
had
visited
nigeria
was
asking
him
his
opinion
of
the
famous
bimbaweh
remains
of
the
lower
niger
the
duke
confessed
that
he
really
noticed
them
and
the
doctor
assured
him
that
strabo
had
indubitably
mentioned
them
he
would
show
the
duke
the
very
passage
and
that
they
apparently
lay
if
his
memory
served
him
about
halfway
between
oohat
and
ohat
whether
above
oohat
and
below
ohat
or
above
ohat
and
below
oohat
he
would
not
care
to
say
for
a
certainty
for
that
the
duke
must
wait
till
the
president
had
time
to
consult
his
library
and
the
duke
was
fascinated
forthwith
with
the
president
knowledge
of
nigerian
geography
and
explained
that
he
had
once
actually
descended
from
below
timbuctoo
to
oohat
in
a
doolie
manned
only
by
four
swats
so
presently
having
drunk
the
cocktails
the
party
moved
solemnly
in
a
body
from
the
alcove
towards
the
private
upstairs
still
busily
talking
of
the
bimbaweh
remains
and
the
swats
and
whether
the
doolie
was
or
was
not
the
original
goatskin
boat
of
the
book
of
genesis
and
when
they
entered
the
private
with
its
table
and
cut
glass
and
flowers
as
arranged
by
a
retreating
philosopher
now
heading
towards
the
gaiety
theatre
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
the
duke
again
exclaimed
really
you
have
a
most
comfortable
club
delightful
so
they
sat
down
to
dinner
over
which
furlong
offered
up
a
grace
as
short
as
any
that
are
known
even
to
the
anglican
clergy
and
the
head
waiter
now
in
deep
distress
for
he
had
been
sending
out
telephone
messages
in
vain
to
the
grand
palaver
and
the
continental
like
the
captain
of
a
sinking
ship
served
oysters
that
he
had
opened
himself
and
poured
rhine
wine
with
a
trembling
hand
for
he
knew
that
unless
by
magic
a
new
chef
and
a
waiter
or
two
could
be
got
from
the
palaver
all
hope
was
lost
but
the
guests
still
knew
nothing
of
his
fears
boomer
was
eating
his
oysters
as
a
nigerian
hippo
might
eat
up
the
crew
of
a
doolie
in
great
mouthfuls
and
commenting
as
he
did
so
upon
the
luxuriousness
of
modern
life
and
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
oysters
he
illustrated
for
the
duke
with
two
pieces
of
bread
the
essential
difference
in
structure
between
the
mexican
and
the
tribal
house
of
the
navajos
and
lest
the
duke
should
confound
either
or
both
of
them
with
the
adobe
hut
of
the
bimbaweh
tribes
he
showed
the
difference
at
once
with
a
couple
of
olives
by
this
time
of
course
the
delay
in
the
service
was
getting
noticeable
fyshe
was
directing
angry
glances
towards
the
door
looking
for
the
reappearance
of
the
waiter
and
growling
an
apology
to
his
guests
but
the
president
waved
the
apology
aside
in
my
college
days
he
said
i
should
have
considered
a
plate
of
oysters
an
ample
meal
i
should
have
asked
for
nothing
more
we
eat
he
said
too
much
this
of
course
started
fyshe
on
his
favourite
topic
luxury
he
exclaimed
i
should
think
so
it
is
the
curse
of
the
age
the
appalling
growth
of
luxury
the
piling
up
of
money
the
ease
with
which
huge
fortunes
are
made
good
thought
the
duke
here
we
are
coming
to
it
these
are
the
things
that
are
going
to
ruin
us
mark
my
words
the
whole
thing
is
bound
to
end
in
a
tremendous
crash
i
do
mind
telling
you
duke
my
friends
here
i
am
sure
know
it
already
that
i
am
more
or
less
a
revolutionary
socialist
i
am
absolutely
convinced
sir
that
our
modern
civilization
will
end
in
a
great
social
catastrophe
mark
what
i
say
and
here
fyshe
became
exceedingly
impressive
a
great
social
catastrophe
some
of
us
may
not
live
to
see
it
perhaps
but
you
for
instance
furlong
are
a
younger
man
you
certainly
will
but
here
fyshe
was
understating
the
case
they
were
all
going
to
live
to
see
it
right
on
the
spot
for
it
was
just
at
this
moment
when
fyshe
was
talking
of
the
social
catastrophe
and
explaining
with
flashing
eyes
that
it
was
bound
to
come
that
it
came
and
when
it
came
it
lit
of
all
places
in
the
world
right
there
in
the
private
of
the
mausoleum
club
for
the
gloomy
head
waiter
and
leaned
over
the
back
of
fyshe
chair
and
whispered
to
him
eh
what
said
fyshe
the
head
waiter
his
features
stricken
with
inward
agony
whispered
again
the
infernal
damn
scoundrels
said
fyshe
starting
back
in
his
chair
on
strike
in
this
club
it
an
outrage
i
very
sorry
sir
i
did
like
to
tell
you
sir
i
hoped
i
might
have
got
help
from
the
outside
but
it
seems
sir
the
hotels
are
all
the
same
way
do
you
mean
to
say
said
fyshe
speaking
very
slowly
that
there
is
no
dinner
i
sorry
sir
moaned
the
waiter
it
appears
the
chef
had
even
cooked
it
beyond
what
on
the
table
sir
there
nothing
the
social
catastrophe
had
come
fyshe
sat
silent
with
his
fist
clenched
boomer
with
his
great
face
transfixed
stared
at
the
empty
thinking
perhaps
of
his
college
days
the
duke
with
his
hundred
thousand
dashed
from
his
lips
in
the
second
cup
of
champagne
that
was
never
served
thought
of
his
politeness
first
and
murmured
something
about
taking
them
to
his
hotel
but
there
is
no
need
to
follow
the
unhappy
details
of
the
unended
dinner
fyshe
one
idea
was
to
be
gone
he
was
too
true
an
artist
to
think
that
finance
could
be
carried
on
over
the
of
a
restaurant
or
on
an
empty
stomach
in
a
deserted
club
the
thing
must
be
done
over
again
he
must
wait
his
time
and
begin
anew
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
little
dinner
party
of
lucullus
fyshe
dissolved
itself
into
its
constituent
elements
like
broken
pieces
of
society
in
the
great
cataclysm
portrayed
by
fyshe
himself
the
duke
was
bowled
home
in
a
snorting
motor
to
the
brilliant
rotunda
of
the
grand
palaver
itself
waiterless
and
supperless
the
rector
of
asaph
wandered
off
home
to
his
rectory
musing
upon
the
contents
of
its
pantry
and
fyshe
and
the
gigantic
doctor
walked
side
by
side
homewards
along
plutoria
avenue
beneath
the
elm
trees
nor
had
they
gone
any
great
distance
before
boomer
fell
to
talking
of
the
duke
a
charming
man
he
said
delightful
i
feel
extremely
sorry
for
him
no
worse
off
i
presume
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
growled
fyshe
who
was
feeling
in
the
sourest
of
democratic
moods
a
man
does
need
to
be
a
duke
to
have
a
stomach
oh
pooh
pooh
said
the
president
waving
the
topic
aside
with
his
hand
in
the
air
i
do
refer
to
that
oh
not
at
all
i
was
thinking
of
his
financial
position
an
ancient
family
like
the
dulhams
it
seems
too
bad
altogether
for
of
course
to
an
archaeologist
like
boomer
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
pedigree
and
fortunes
of
the
greater
ducal
families
from
jock
of
ealing
downwards
was
nothing
it
went
without
saying
as
beside
the
neanderthal
skull
and
the
bimbaweh
ruins
it
did
count
fyshe
stopped
absolutely
still
in
his
tracks
his
financial
position
he
questioned
quick
as
a
lynx
certainly
said
boomer
i
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
the
dulham
family
are
practically
ruined
the
duke
i
imagine
is
under
the
necessity
of
mortgaging
his
estates
indeed
i
should
suppose
he
is
here
in
america
to
raise
money
fyshe
was
a
man
of
lightning
action
any
man
accustomed
to
the
stock
exchange
learns
to
think
quickly
one
moment
he
cried
i
see
we
are
right
at
your
door
may
i
just
run
in
and
use
your
telephone
i
want
to
call
up
boulder
for
a
moment
two
minutes
later
fyshe
was
saying
into
the
telephone
oh
is
that
you
boulder
i
was
looking
for
you
in
vain
today
wanted
you
to
meet
the
duke
of
dulham
who
came
in
quite
unexpectedly
from
new
york
felt
sure
you
like
to
meet
him
wanted
you
at
the
club
for
dinner
and
now
it
turns
out
that
the
club
all
upset
waiters
strike
or
some
such
rascality
and
the
palaver
so
i
hear
is
in
the
same
fix
could
you
possibly
here
fyshe
paused
listening
a
moment
and
then
went
on
yes
yes
an
excellent
idea
most
kind
of
you
pray
do
send
your
motor
to
the
hotel
and
give
the
duke
a
bite
of
dinner
no
i
would
join
you
thanks
most
kind
good
night
and
within
a
few
minutes
more
the
motor
of
boulder
was
rolling
down
from
plutoria
avenue
to
the
grand
palaver
hotel
what
passed
between
boulder
and
the
duke
that
evening
is
not
known
that
they
must
have
proved
congenial
company
to
one
another
there
is
no
doubt
in
fact
it
would
seem
that
dissimilar
as
they
were
in
many
ways
they
found
a
common
bond
of
interest
in
sport
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
boulder
may
have
mentioned
that
he
had
a
what
the
duke
would
call
a
in
wisconsin
woods
and
that
it
was
made
of
logs
rough
cedar
logs
not
squared
and
that
the
timber
wolves
and
others
which
surrounded
it
were
of
a
ferocity
without
parallel
those
who
know
the
duke
best
could
measure
the
effect
of
that
upon
his
temperament
at
any
rate
it
is
certain
that
lucullus
fyshe
at
his
next
morning
chuckled
with
suppressed
joy
to
read
in
the
the
item
we
learn
that
the
duke
of
dulham
who
has
been
paying
a
brief
visit
to
the
city
leaves
this
morning
with
asmodeus
boulder
for
the
wisconsin
woods
we
understand
that
boulder
intends
to
show
his
guest
who
is
an
ardent
sportsman
something
of
the
american
wolf
and
so
the
duke
went
whirling
westwards
and
northwards
with
boulder
in
the
end
of
a
pullman
car
that
was
all
littered
up
with
express
rifles
and
leather
game
bags
and
lynx
catchers
and
wolf
traps
and
heaven
knows
what
and
the
duke
had
on
his
very
roughest
made
apparently
of
alligator
hide
and
as
he
sat
there
with
a
rifle
across
his
knees
while
the
train
swept
onwards
through
open
fields
and
broken
woods
the
real
country
at
last
towards
the
wisconsin
forest
there
was
such
a
light
of
genial
happiness
in
his
face
that
had
not
been
seen
there
since
he
had
been
marooned
in
the
mud
jungles
of
upper
burmah
and
opposite
boulder
looked
at
him
with
fixed
silent
eyes
and
murmured
from
time
to
time
some
renewed
information
of
the
ferocity
of
the
but
of
wolves
other
than
the
and
fiercer
still
into
whose
hands
the
duke
might
fall
in
america
he
spoke
never
a
word
nor
is
it
known
in
the
record
what
happened
in
wisconsin
and
to
the
mausoleum
club
the
duke
and
his
visit
remained
only
as
a
passing
and
a
pleasant
memory
chapter
two
the
wizard
of
finance
down
in
the
city
itself
just
below
the
residential
street
where
the
mausoleum
club
is
situated
there
stands
overlooking
central
square
the
grand
palaver
hotel
it
is
in
truth
at
no
great
distance
from
the
club
not
half
a
minute
in
one
motor
in
fact
one
could
almost
walk
it
but
in
central
square
the
quiet
of
plutoria
avenue
is
exchanged
for
another
atmosphere
there
are
fountains
that
splash
unendingly
and
mingle
their
music
with
the
sound
of
the
and
the
clatter
of
the
cabs
there
are
real
trees
and
little
green
benches
with
people
reading
yesterday
newspaper
and
grass
cut
into
plots
among
the
asphalt
there
is
at
one
end
a
statue
of
the
first
governor
of
the
state
cut
in
stone
and
at
the
other
a
statue
of
the
last
ever
so
much
larger
than
life
cast
in
bronze
and
all
the
people
who
pass
by
pause
and
look
at
this
statue
and
point
at
it
with
because
it
is
of
extraordinary
interest
in
fact
it
is
an
example
of
the
new
process
of
casting
by
which
you
can
cast
a
state
governor
any
size
you
like
no
matter
what
you
start
from
those
who
know
about
such
things
explain
what
an
interesting
contrast
the
two
statues
are
for
in
the
case
of
the
governor
of
a
hundred
years
ago
one
had
to
start
from
plain
rough
material
and
work
patiently
for
years
to
get
the
effect
whereas
now
the
material
matter
at
all
and
with
any
sort
of
scrap
treated
in
the
gas
furnace
under
tremendous
pressure
one
may
make
a
figure
of
colossal
size
like
the
one
in
central
square
so
naturally
central
square
with
its
trees
and
its
fountains
and
its
statues
is
one
of
the
places
of
chief
interest
in
the
city
but
especially
because
there
stands
along
one
side
of
it
the
vast
pile
of
the
grand
palaver
hotel
it
rises
fifteen
stories
high
and
fills
all
one
side
of
the
square
it
has
overlooking
the
trees
in
the
square
twelve
hundred
rooms
with
three
thousand
windows
and
it
would
have
held
all
george
washington
army
even
people
in
other
cities
who
have
never
seen
it
know
it
well
from
its
advertising
the
most
homelike
hotel
in
america
so
it
is
labelled
in
all
the
magazines
the
expensive
ones
on
the
continent
in
fact
the
aim
of
the
company
that
owns
the
grand
palaver
and
they
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
is
to
make
the
place
as
much
a
home
as
possible
therein
lies
its
charm
it
is
a
home
you
realize
that
when
you
look
up
at
the
grand
palaver
from
the
square
at
night
when
the
twelve
hundred
guests
have
turned
on
the
lights
of
the
three
thousand
windows
you
realize
it
at
theatre
time
when
the
great
string
of
motors
come
sweeping
to
the
doors
of
the
palaver
to
carry
the
twelve
hundred
guests
to
twelve
hundred
seats
in
the
theatres
at
four
dollars
a
seat
but
most
of
all
do
you
appreciate
the
character
of
the
grand
palaver
when
you
step
into
its
rotunda
aladdin
enchanted
palace
was
nothing
to
it
it
has
a
vast
ceiling
with
a
hundred
glittering
lights
and
within
it
night
and
day
is
a
surging
crowd
that
is
never
still
and
a
babel
of
voices
that
is
never
hushed
and
over
all
there
hangs
an
enchanted
cloud
of
thin
blue
tobacco
smoke
such
as
might
enshroud
the
conjured
vision
of
a
magician
of
baghdad
or
damascus
in
and
through
the
rotunda
there
are
palm
trees
to
rest
the
eye
and
rubber
trees
in
boxes
to
soothe
the
mind
and
there
are
great
leather
lounges
and
deep
armchairs
and
here
and
there
huge
brass
as
big
as
etruscan
along
one
side
is
a
counter
with
grated
wickets
like
a
bank
and
behind
it
are
five
clerks
with
flattened
hair
and
tall
collars
dressed
in
long
black
all
day
like
members
of
a
legislature
they
have
great
books
in
front
of
them
in
which
they
study
unceasingly
and
at
their
lightest
thought
they
strike
a
bell
with
the
open
palm
of
their
hand
and
at
the
sound
of
it
a
page
boy
in
a
monkey
suit
with
stamped
all
over
him
in
brass
bounds
to
the
desk
and
off
again
shouting
a
call
into
the
unheeding
crowd
vociferously
the
sound
of
it
fills
for
a
moment
the
great
space
of
the
rotunda
it
echoes
down
the
corridors
to
the
side
it
floats
softly
melodious
through
the
palm
trees
of
the
ladies
palm
room
it
is
heard
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distant
grill
and
in
the
depths
of
the
barber
shop
below
the
level
of
the
street
the
barber
arrests
a
moment
the
drowsy
hum
of
his
shampoo
brushes
to
catch
the
sound
as
might
a
miner
in
the
sunken
galleries
of
a
coastal
mine
cease
in
his
toil
a
moment
to
hear
the
distant
murmur
of
the
sea
and
the
clerks
call
for
the
pages
the
pages
call
for
the
guests
and
the
guests
call
for
the
porters
the
bells
clang
the
elevators
rattle
till
home
itself
was
never
half
so
homelike
a
call
for
tomlinson
a
call
for
mr
tomlinson
so
went
the
sound
echoing
through
the
rotunda
and
as
the
page
boy
found
him
and
handed
him
on
a
salver
a
telegram
to
read
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
about
him
turned
for
a
moment
to
look
upon
the
figure
of
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
there
he
stood
in
his
hat
and
his
long
black
coat
his
shoulders
slightly
bent
with
his
years
anyone
who
had
known
him
in
the
olden
days
on
his
bush
farm
beside
tomlinson
creek
in
the
country
of
the
great
lakes
would
have
recognized
him
in
a
moment
there
was
still
on
his
face
that
strange
puzzled
look
that
it
habitually
wore
only
now
of
course
the
financial
papers
were
calling
it
unfathomable
there
was
a
certain
way
in
which
his
eye
roved
to
and
fro
inquiringly
that
might
have
looked
like
perplexity
were
it
not
that
the
had
recognized
it
as
the
searching
look
of
a
captain
of
industry
one
might
have
thought
that
for
all
the
goodness
in
it
there
was
something
simple
in
his
face
were
it
not
that
the
and
pictorial
had
called
the
face
inscrutable
and
had
proved
it
so
with
an
illustration
that
left
no
doubt
of
the
matter
indeed
the
face
of
tomlinson
of
creek
now
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
was
not
commonly
spoken
of
as
a
by
the
paragraphers
of
the
saturday
magazine
sections
but
was
more
usually
referred
to
as
a
mask
and
it
would
appear
that
napoleon
the
first
had
had
one
also
the
saturday
editors
were
never
tired
of
describing
the
strange
impressive
personality
of
tomlinson
the
great
dominating
character
of
the
newest
and
highest
finance
from
the
moment
when
the
interim
prospectus
of
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
had
broken
like
a
tidal
wave
over
stock
exchange
circles
the
picture
of
tomlinson
the
sleeping
shareholder
of
uncomputed
millions
had
filled
the
imagination
of
every
dreamer
in
a
nation
of
poets
they
all
described
him
and
when
each
had
finished
he
began
again
the
face
so
wrote
the
editor
of
the
our
own
men
section
of
is
that
of
a
typical
american
captain
of
finance
hard
yet
with
a
certain
softness
broad
but
with
a
certain
length
ductile
but
not
without
its
own
firmness
the
mouth
so
wrote
the
editor
of
the
success
column
of
is
strong
but
pliable
the
jaw
firm
and
yet
movable
while
there
is
something
in
the
set
of
the
ear
that
suggests
the
swift
eager
mind
of
the
born
leader
of
men
so
from
state
to
state
ran
the
portrait
of
tomlinson
of
creek
drawn
by
people
who
had
never
seen
him
so
did
it
reach
out
and
cross
the
ocean
till
the
french
journals
inserted
a
picture
which
they
used
for
such
occasions
and
called
it
tomlinson
nouveau
capitaine
de
la
haute
finance
en
and
the
german
weeklies
inserting
also
a
suitable
picture
from
their
stock
marked
it
tomlinson
amerikanischer
industrie
und
thus
did
tomlinson
float
from
tomlinson
creek
beside
lake
erie
to
the
very
banks
of
the
danube
and
the
drave
some
writers
grew
lyric
about
him
what
visions
they
asked
could
one
but
read
them
must
lie
behind
the
quiet
dreaming
eyes
of
that
inscrutable
face
they
might
have
read
them
easily
enough
had
they
but
had
the
key
anyone
who
looked
upon
tomlinson
as
he
stood
there
in
the
roar
and
clatter
of
the
great
rotunda
of
the
grand
palaver
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
fumbling
at
the
wrong
end
to
open
it
might
have
read
the
visions
of
the
had
he
but
known
their
nature
they
were
simple
enough
for
the
visions
in
the
mind
of
tomlinson
wizard
of
finance
were
for
the
most
part
those
of
a
hillside
farm
beside
lake
erie
where
tomlinson
creek
runs
down
to
the
low
edge
of
the
lake
and
where
the
wind
ripples
the
rushes
of
the
shallow
water
that
and
the
vision
of
a
frame
house
and
the
snake
fences
of
the
fourth
concession
road
where
it
falls
to
the
lakeside
and
if
the
eyes
of
the
man
are
dreamy
and
abstracted
it
is
because
there
lies
over
the
vision
of
this
vanished
farm
an
infinite
regret
greater
in
its
compass
than
all
the
shares
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
has
ever
thrown
upon
the
market
when
tomlinson
had
opened
the
telegram
he
stood
with
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hand
looking
the
boy
full
in
the
face
his
look
had
in
it
that
peculiar
quality
that
the
newspapers
were
calling
napoleonic
abstraction
in
reality
he
was
wondering
whether
to
give
the
boy
cents
or
fifty
the
message
that
he
had
just
read
was
worded
morning
quotations
show
preferred
falling
rapidly
recommend
instant
sale
no
confidence
send
instructions
the
wizard
of
finance
took
from
his
pocket
a
pencil
it
was
a
carpenter
pencil
and
wrote
across
the
face
of
the
message
buy
me
quite
a
bit
more
of
the
same
yours
truly
this
he
gave
to
the
boy
take
it
over
to
him
he
said
pointing
to
the
telegraph
corner
of
the
rotunda
then
after
another
pause
he
mumbled
here
sonny
and
gave
the
boy
a
dollar
with
that
he
turned
to
walk
towards
the
elevator
and
all
the
people
about
him
who
had
watched
the
signing
of
the
message
knew
that
some
big
financial
deal
was
going
through
a
in
fact
they
called
it
the
elevator
took
the
wizard
to
the
second
floor
as
he
went
up
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
gripped
a
quarter
then
changed
his
mind
and
felt
for
a
piece
and
finally
gave
them
both
to
the
elevator
boy
after
which
he
walked
along
the
corridor
till
he
reached
the
corner
suite
of
rooms
a
palace
in
itself
for
which
he
was
paying
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
ever
since
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
company
had
begun
tearing
up
the
bed
of
tomlinson
creek
in
cahoga
county
with
its
hydraulic
dredges
well
mother
he
said
as
he
entered
there
was
a
woman
seated
near
the
window
a
woman
with
a
plain
homely
face
such
as
they
wear
in
the
farm
kitchens
of
cahoga
county
and
a
set
of
fashionable
clothes
upon
her
such
as
they
sell
to
the
ladies
of
plutoria
avenue
this
was
mother
the
wife
of
the
wizard
of
finance
and
eight
years
younger
than
himself
and
she
too
was
in
the
papers
and
the
public
eye
and
whatsoever
the
shops
had
fresh
from
paris
at
fabulous
prices
that
they
sold
to
mother
they
had
put
a
balkan
hat
upon
her
with
an
upright
feather
and
they
had
hung
gold
chains
on
her
and
everything
that
was
most
expensive
they
had
hung
and
tied
on
mother
you
might
see
her
emerging
any
morning
from
the
grand
palaver
in
her
jacket
and
her
balkan
hat
a
figure
of
infinite
pathos
and
whatever
she
wore
the
lady
editors
of
and
du
wrote
it
out
in
french
and
one
paper
had
called
her
a
and
another
had
spoken
of
her
as
a
grande
dame
which
the
tomlinsons
thought
must
be
a
misprint
but
in
any
case
for
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
it
was
a
great
relief
to
have
as
his
wife
a
woman
like
mother
because
he
knew
that
she
had
taught
school
in
cahoga
county
and
could
hold
her
own
in
the
city
with
any
of
them
so
mother
spent
her
time
sitting
in
her
beetle
jacket
in
the
suite
reading
new
novels
in
brilliant
paper
covers
and
the
wizard
on
his
trips
up
and
down
to
the
rotunda
brought
her
the
very
best
the
ones
that
cost
a
dollar
fifty
because
he
knew
that
out
home
she
had
only
been
able
to
read
books
like
nathaniel
hawthorne
and
walter
scott
that
were
only
worth
ten
cents
how
fred
said
the
wizard
laying
aside
his
hat
and
looking
towards
the
closed
door
of
an
inner
room
is
he
better
some
said
mother
he
dressed
but
he
lying
down
fred
was
the
son
of
the
wizard
and
mother
in
the
inner
room
he
lay
on
a
sofa
a
great
hulking
boy
of
seventeen
in
a
flowered
fancying
himself
ill
there
was
a
packet
of
cigarettes
and
a
box
of
chocolates
on
a
chair
beside
him
and
he
had
the
blind
drawn
and
his
eyes
to
impress
himself
yet
this
was
the
same
boy
that
less
than
a
year
ago
on
creek
had
worn
a
rough
store
suit
and
set
his
sturdy
shoulders
to
the
at
present
fortune
was
busy
taking
from
him
the
golden
gifts
which
the
fairies
of
cahoga
county
lake
erie
had
laid
in
his
cradle
seventeen
years
ago
the
wizard
into
the
inner
room
and
from
the
open
door
his
listening
wife
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
boy
saying
in
a
tone
as
of
one
distraught
with
suffering
is
there
any
more
of
that
jelly
could
he
have
any
do
you
suppose
asked
tomlinson
coming
back
it
all
right
said
mother
if
it
will
sit
on
his
stomach
for
this
in
the
dietetics
of
cahoga
county
is
the
sole
test
all
those
things
can
be
eaten
which
will
sit
on
the
stomach
anything
that
sit
there
is
not
eatable
do
you
suppose
i
could
get
them
to
get
any
questioned
tomlinson
would
it
be
all
right
to
telephone
down
to
the
office
or
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
ring
perhaps
said
his
wife
it
would
be
better
to
look
out
into
the
hall
and
see
if
there
is
someone
round
that
would
tell
them
this
was
the
kind
of
problem
with
which
tomlinson
and
his
wife
in
their
suite
in
the
grand
palaver
grappled
all
day
and
when
presently
a
tall
waiter
in
appeared
and
said
jelly
yes
sir
immediately
sir
would
you
like
sir
maraschino
sir
or
portovino
sir
tomlinson
gazed
at
him
gloomily
wondering
if
he
would
take
five
dollars
what
does
the
doctor
say
is
wrong
with
fred
asked
tomlinson
when
the
waiter
had
gone
he
do
just
say
said
mother
he
said
he
must
keep
very
quiet
he
looked
in
this
morning
for
a
minute
or
two
and
he
said
he
look
in
later
in
the
day
again
but
he
said
to
keep
fred
very
quiet
exactly
in
other
words
fred
had
pretty
much
the
same
complaint
as
the
rest
of
slyder
patients
on
plutoria
avenue
and
was
to
be
treated
in
the
same
way
slyder
who
was
the
most
fashionable
practitioner
in
the
city
spent
his
entire
time
moving
to
and
fro
in
an
almost
noiseless
motor
earnestly
advising
people
to
keep
quiet
you
must
keep
very
quiet
for
a
little
while
he
would
say
with
a
sigh
as
he
sat
beside
a
as
he
drew
on
his
gloves
in
the
hall
below
he
would
shake
his
head
very
impressively
and
say
you
must
keep
him
very
quiet
and
so
pass
out
quite
soundlessly
by
this
means
slyder
often
succeeded
in
keeping
people
quiet
for
weeks
it
was
all
the
medicine
that
he
knew
but
it
was
enough
and
as
his
patients
always
got
well
there
being
nothing
wrong
with
them
his
reputation
was
immense
very
naturally
the
wizard
and
his
wife
were
impressed
with
him
they
had
never
seen
such
therapeutics
in
cahoga
county
where
the
practice
of
medicine
is
carried
on
with
forceps
pumps
squirts
splints
and
other
instruments
of
violence
the
waiter
had
hardly
gone
when
a
boy
appeared
at
the
door
this
time
he
presented
to
tomlinson
not
one
telegram
but
a
little
bundle
of
them
the
wizard
read
them
with
a
lengthening
face
the
first
ran
something
like
this
congratulate
you
on
your
daring
market
turned
instantly
and
the
next
your
opinion
justified
market
rose
have
sold
at
points
profit
and
a
third
your
forecast
entirely
correct
rose
at
once
send
further
instructions
these
and
similar
messages
were
from
brokers
offices
and
all
of
them
were
in
the
same
tone
one
told
him
that
was
up
and
another
had
passed
and
another
that
had
risen
ten
all
of
which
things
were
imputed
to
the
wonderful
sagacity
of
tomlinson
whereas
if
they
had
told
him
that
y
had
risen
to
the
moon
he
would
have
been
just
as
wise
as
to
what
it
meant
well
said
the
wife
of
the
wizard
as
her
husband
finished
looking
through
the
reports
how
are
things
this
morning
are
they
any
better
no
said
tomlinson
and
he
sighed
as
he
said
it
this
is
the
worst
day
yet
it
just
been
a
shower
of
telegrams
and
mostly
all
the
same
i
ca
do
the
figuring
of
it
like
you
can
but
i
reckon
i
must
have
made
another
hundred
thousand
dollars
since
yesterday
you
do
say
so
said
mother
and
they
looked
at
one
another
gloomily
and
half
a
million
last
week
was
it
said
tomlinson
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
i
afraid
mother
he
continued
it
no
good
we
do
know
how
we
were
brought
up
to
it
all
of
which
meant
that
if
the
editor
of
the
or
had
been
able
to
know
what
was
happening
with
the
two
wizards
he
could
have
written
up
a
news
story
calculated
to
electrify
all
america
for
the
truth
was
that
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
was
attempting
to
carry
out
a
greater
than
any
as
yet
attributed
to
him
by
the
press
he
was
trying
to
lose
his
money
that
in
the
sickness
of
his
soul
crushed
by
the
grand
palaver
overwhelmed
with
the
burden
of
high
finance
had
become
his
aim
to
be
done
with
it
to
get
rid
of
his
whole
fortune
but
if
you
own
a
fortune
that
is
computed
anywhere
from
fifty
millions
up
with
no
limit
at
the
top
if
you
own
of
all
the
preferred
stock
of
an
erie
auriferous
consolidated
that
is
digging
gold
in
hydraulic
bucketfuls
from
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
river
bed
the
task
of
losing
it
is
no
easy
matter
there
are
men
no
doubt
versed
in
finance
who
might
succeed
in
doing
it
but
they
have
a
training
that
tomlinson
lacked
invest
it
as
he
would
in
the
worst
securities
that
offered
the
most
rickety
of
stock
the
most
fraudulent
bonds
back
it
came
to
him
when
he
threw
a
handful
away
back
came
two
in
its
place
and
at
every
new
coup
the
crowd
applauded
the
incomparable
daring
the
unparalleled
prescience
of
the
wizard
like
the
touch
of
midas
his
hand
turned
everything
to
gold
mother
he
repeated
it
no
use
it
like
this
here
destiny
as
the
books
call
it
the
great
fortune
that
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
was
trying
his
best
to
lose
had
come
to
him
with
wonderful
suddenness
as
yet
it
was
hardly
six
months
old
as
to
how
it
had
originated
there
were
all
sorts
of
stories
afloat
in
the
weekly
illustrated
press
they
agreed
mostly
on
the
general
basis
that
tomlinson
had
made
his
vast
fortune
by
his
own
indomitable
pluck
and
dogged
industry
some
said
that
he
had
been
at
one
time
a
mere
farm
hand
who
by
sheer
doggedness
had
fought
his
way
from
the
to
the
control
of
the
produce
market
of
seventeen
states
others
had
it
that
he
had
been
a
lumberjack
who
by
sheer
doggedness
had
got
possession
of
the
whole
lumber
forest
of
the
lake
district
others
said
that
he
had
been
a
miner
in
a
lake
superior
copper
mine
who
had
by
the
doggedness
of
his
character
got
a
practical
monopoly
of
the
copper
supply
these
saturday
articles
at
any
rate
made
the
saturday
reader
rigid
with
sympathetic
doggedness
himself
which
was
all
that
the
editor
who
was
doggedly
trying
to
make
the
paper
pay
wanted
to
effect
but
in
reality
the
making
of
tomlinson
fortune
was
very
simple
the
recipe
for
it
is
open
to
anyone
it
is
only
necessary
to
own
a
hillside
farm
beside
lake
erie
where
the
uncleared
bush
and
the
broken
fields
go
straggling
down
to
the
lake
and
to
have
running
through
it
a
creek
such
as
that
called
tomlinson
brawling
among
the
stones
and
willows
and
to
discover
in
the
bed
of
a
creek
a
gold
mine
that
is
all
nor
is
it
necessary
in
these
days
to
discover
the
gold
for
one
self
one
might
have
lived
a
lifetime
on
the
farm
as
father
had
and
never
discover
it
for
one
self
for
that
indeed
the
best
medium
of
destiny
is
a
geologist
let
us
say
the
senior
professor
of
geology
at
plutoria
university
that
was
how
it
happened
the
senior
professor
so
it
chanced
was
spending
his
vacation
near
by
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
his
time
was
mostly
passed
for
how
better
can
a
man
spend
a
month
of
pleasure
in
looking
for
outcroppings
of
devonian
rock
of
the
period
for
which
purpose
he
carried
a
vacation
hammer
in
his
pocket
and
made
from
time
to
time
a
note
or
two
as
he
went
along
or
filled
his
pockets
with
the
chippings
of
vacation
rocks
so
it
chanced
that
he
came
to
tomlinson
creek
at
the
very
point
where
a
great
slab
of
devonian
rock
bursts
through
the
clay
of
the
bank
when
the
senior
professor
of
geology
saw
it
and
noticed
a
stripe
like
a
mark
on
a
tiger
back
a
fault
he
called
it
that
ran
over
the
face
of
the
block
he
was
at
it
in
an
instant
beating
off
fragments
with
his
little
hammer
tomlinson
and
his
boy
fred
were
logging
in
the
underbrush
near
by
with
a
long
chain
and
yoke
of
oxen
but
the
geologist
was
so
excited
that
he
did
not
see
them
till
the
sound
of
his
eager
hammer
had
brought
them
to
his
side
they
took
him
up
to
the
frame
house
in
the
clearing
where
the
chatelaine
was
hoeing
a
potato
patch
with
a
man
hat
on
her
head
and
they
gave
him
buttermilk
and
soda
cakes
but
his
hand
shook
so
that
he
could
hardly
eat
them
the
geologist
left
cahoga
station
that
night
for
the
city
with
a
newspaper
full
of
specimens
inside
his
and
he
knew
that
if
any
person
or
persons
would
put
up
money
enough
to
tear
that
block
of
rock
away
and
follow
the
fissure
down
there
would
be
found
there
something
to
astonish
humanity
geologists
and
all
after
that
point
in
the
launching
of
a
gold
mine
the
rest
is
easy
generous
men
interested
in
geology
were
soon
found
there
was
no
stint
of
money
the
great
rock
was
torn
sideways
from
its
place
and
from
beneath
it
the
crumbled
glittering
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
was
sent
in
little
boxes
to
the
testing
laboratories
of
plutoria
university
there
the
senior
professor
of
geology
had
sat
up
with
it
far
into
the
night
in
a
darkened
laboratory
with
little
blue
flames
playing
underneath
crucibles
as
in
a
magician
cavern
and
with
the
door
locked
and
as
each
sample
that
he
tested
was
set
aside
and
tied
in
a
cardboard
box
by
itself
he
labelled
it
aur
and
the
pen
shook
in
his
hand
as
he
marked
it
for
to
professors
of
geology
those
symbols
mean
this
is
per
cent
pure
gold
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
senior
professor
of
geology
working
far
into
the
night
among
the
blue
flames
shook
with
excitement
not
of
course
for
the
gold
sake
as
money
he
had
no
time
to
think
of
that
but
because
if
this
thing
was
true
it
meant
that
an
auriferous
vein
had
been
found
in
what
was
devonian
rock
of
the
stratification
and
if
that
was
so
it
upset
enough
geology
to
spoil
a
textbook
it
would
mean
that
the
professor
could
read
a
paper
at
the
next
conference
that
would
turn
the
whole
assembly
into
a
bedlam
it
pleased
him
too
to
know
that
the
men
he
was
dealing
with
were
generous
they
had
asked
him
to
name
his
own
price
or
the
tests
that
he
made
and
when
he
had
said
two
dollars
per
sample
they
had
told
him
to
go
right
ahead
the
professor
was
not
i
suppose
a
mercenary
man
but
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
he
could
clean
up
sixteen
dollars
in
a
single
evening
in
his
laboratory
it
showed
at
any
rate
that
businessmen
put
science
at
its
proper
value
strangest
of
all
was
the
fact
that
the
men
had
told
him
that
even
this
ore
was
apparently
nothing
to
what
there
was
it
had
all
come
out
of
one
single
spot
in
the
creek
not
the
hundredth
part
of
the
whole
claim
lower
down
where
they
had
thrown
the
big
dam
across
to
make
the
bed
dry
they
were
taking
out
this
same
stuff
and
even
better
so
they
said
in
cartloads
the
hydraulic
dredges
were
tearing
it
from
the
bed
of
the
creek
all
day
and
at
night
a
great
circuit
of
arc
lights
gleamed
and
sputtered
over
the
roaring
labour
of
the
friends
of
geological
research
thus
had
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
broken
in
a
tidal
wave
over
financial
circles
on
the
stock
exchange
in
the
downtown
offices
and
among
the
palm
trees
of
the
mausoleum
club
they
talked
of
nothing
else
and
so
great
was
the
power
of
the
wave
that
it
washed
tomlinson
and
his
wife
along
on
the
crest
of
it
and
landed
them
fifty
feet
up
in
their
suite
in
the
grand
palaver
and
as
a
result
of
it
mother
wore
a
jacket
and
tomlinson
received
a
hundred
telegrams
a
day
and
fred
quit
school
and
ate
chocolates
but
in
the
business
world
the
most
amazing
thing
about
it
was
the
wonderful
shrewdness
of
tomlinson
the
first
sign
of
it
had
been
that
he
had
utterly
refused
to
allow
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
as
the
friends
of
geology
called
themselves
to
take
over
the
top
half
of
the
tomlinson
farm
for
the
bottom
part
he
let
them
give
him
of
the
preferred
stock
in
the
company
in
return
for
their
supply
of
development
capital
this
was
their
own
proposition
in
fact
they
reckoned
that
in
doing
this
they
were
trading
about
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
machinery
for
say
ten
million
dollars
of
gold
but
it
frightened
them
when
tomlinson
said
yes
to
the
offer
and
when
he
said
that
as
to
common
stock
they
might
keep
it
it
was
no
use
to
him
they
were
alarmed
and
uneasy
till
they
made
him
take
a
block
of
it
for
the
sake
of
market
confidence
but
the
top
end
of
the
farm
he
refused
to
surrender
and
the
friends
of
applied
geology
knew
that
there
must
be
something
pretty
large
behind
this
refusal
the
more
so
as
the
reason
that
tomlinson
gave
was
such
a
simple
one
he
said
that
he
did
want
to
part
with
the
top
end
of
the
place
because
his
father
was
buried
on
it
beside
the
creek
and
so
he
did
want
the
dam
higher
up
not
for
any
consideration
this
was
regarded
in
business
circles
as
a
piece
of
great
shrewdness
says
his
father
is
buried
there
eh
devilish
shrewd
that
it
was
so
long
since
any
of
the
members
of
the
exchange
or
the
mausoleum
club
had
wandered
into
such
places
as
cahoga
county
that
they
did
not
know
that
there
was
nothing
strange
in
what
tomlinson
said
his
father
was
buried
there
on
the
farm
itself
in
a
grave
overgrown
with
raspberry
bushes
and
with
a
wooden
headstone
encompassed
by
a
square
of
cedar
rails
and
slept
as
many
another
pioneer
of
cahoga
is
sleeping
devilish
smart
idea
they
said
and
forthwith
half
the
financial
men
of
the
city
buried
their
fathers
or
professed
to
have
done
so
in
likely
places
along
the
prospective
of
a
suburban
railway
for
example
in
fact
in
any
place
that
marked
them
out
for
the
joyous
resurrection
of
an
expropriation
purchase
thus
the
astounding
shrewdness
of
tomlinson
rapidly
became
a
legend
the
more
so
as
he
turned
everything
he
touched
to
gold
they
narrated
little
stories
of
him
in
the
corners
of
the
mausoleum
club
i
put
it
to
him
in
a
casual
way
related
for
example
lucullus
fyshe
casually
but
quite
frankly
i
said
here
this
is
just
a
bagatelle
to
you
no
doubt
but
to
me
it
might
be
of
some
use
bonds
i
said
risen
and
a
half
in
a
week
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
they
are
only
collateral
trust
and
that
the
stock
underneath
never
could
and
never
can
earn
a
par
dividend
now
i
said
tomlinson
tell
me
what
all
that
means
would
you
believe
it
the
fellow
looked
me
right
in
the
face
in
that
queer
way
he
has
and
he
said
do
know
he
said
he
did
know
repeated
the
listener
in
a
tone
of
amazement
and
respect
by
jove
eh
he
said
he
did
know
the
man
a
wizard
and
he
looked
as
if
he
did
went
on
fyshe
that
the
deuce
of
it
that
man
when
he
wants
to
can
put
on
a
look
sir
that
simply
means
nothing
absolutely
nothing
in
this
way
tomlinson
had
earned
his
name
of
the
wizard
of
american
finance
and
meantime
tomlinson
and
his
wife
within
their
suite
at
the
grand
palaver
had
long
since
reached
their
decision
for
there
was
one
aspect
and
only
one
in
which
tomlinson
was
really
and
truly
a
wizard
he
saw
clearly
that
for
himself
and
his
wife
the
vast
fortune
that
had
fallen
to
them
was
of
no
manner
of
use
what
did
it
bring
them
the
noise
and
roar
of
the
city
in
place
of
the
silence
of
the
farm
and
the
racket
of
the
great
rotunda
to
drown
the
remembered
murmur
of
the
waters
of
the
creek
so
tomlinson
had
decided
to
rid
himself
of
his
new
wealth
save
only
such
as
might
be
needed
to
make
his
son
a
different
kind
of
man
from
himself
for
fred
of
course
he
said
it
different
but
out
of
such
a
lot
as
that
it
be
easy
to
keep
enough
for
him
it
be
a
grand
thing
for
fred
this
money
he
wo
have
to
grow
up
like
you
and
me
have
opportunities
we
never
got
he
was
getting
them
already
the
opportunity
to
wear
seven
dollar
patent
leather
shoes
and
a
overcoat
with
a
silk
collar
to
lounge
into
shows
and
eat
chocolates
and
smoke
cigarettes
all
these
opportunities
he
was
gathering
immediately
presently
when
he
learned
his
way
round
a
little
he
would
get
still
bigger
ones
he
improving
fast
said
mother
she
was
thinking
of
his
patent
leather
shoes
he
popular
said
his
father
i
notice
it
downstairs
he
sasses
any
of
them
just
as
he
likes
and
no
matter
how
busy
they
are
as
soon
as
they
see
it
fred
they
all
ready
to
have
a
laugh
with
him
certainly
they
were
as
any
hotel
clerk
with
plastered
hair
is
ready
to
laugh
with
the
son
of
a
multimillionaire
it
a
certain
sense
of
humour
that
they
develop
but
for
us
mother
said
the
wizard
we
be
rid
of
it
the
gold
is
there
it
not
right
to
keep
it
back
but
we
just
find
a
way
to
pass
it
on
to
folks
that
need
it
worse
than
we
do
for
a
time
they
had
thought
of
giving
away
the
fortune
but
how
who
did
they
know
that
would
take
it
it
had
crossed
their
minds
for
who
could
live
in
the
city
a
month
without
observing
the
imposing
buildings
of
plutoria
university
as
fine
as
any
departmental
store
in
town
that
they
might
give
it
to
the
college
but
there
it
seemed
the
way
was
blocked
you
see
mother
said
the
puzzled
wizard
we
not
known
strangers
i
look
fine
going
up
there
to
the
college
and
saying
want
to
give
you
people
a
million
dollars
they
laugh
at
me
but
do
one
read
it
in
the
papers
his
wife
had
protested
where
carnegie
gives
ever
so
much
to
the
colleges
more
than
all
got
and
they
take
it
that
different
said
the
wizard
he
in
with
them
they
all
know
him
why
he
a
sort
of
chairman
of
different
boards
of
colleges
and
he
knows
all
the
heads
of
the
schools
and
the
professors
so
it
no
wonder
that
if
he
offers
to
give
a
pension
or
anything
they
take
it
just
think
of
me
going
up
to
one
of
the
professors
up
there
in
the
middle
of
his
teaching
and
saying
like
to
give
you
a
pension
for
life
imagine
it
think
what
he
say
but
the
tomlinsons
could
imagine
it
which
was
just
as
well
so
it
came
about
that
they
had
embarked
on
their
system
mother
who
knew
most
arithmetic
was
the
leading
spirit
she
tracked
out
all
the
stocks
and
bonds
in
the
front
page
of
the
and
on
her
recommendation
the
wizard
bought
they
knew
the
stocks
only
by
their
letters
but
this
itself
gave
a
touch
of
high
finance
to
their
deliberations
i
buy
some
of
this
if
i
was
you
said
mother
it
gone
down
from
to
in
two
days
and
i
reckon
it
be
all
gone
in
ten
days
or
so
would
deb
be
better
it
goes
down
quicker
well
it
a
quick
one
she
assented
but
it
do
go
down
so
steady
you
ca
rely
on
it
you
take
ones
like
and
pfd
they
go
down
all
the
time
and
you
know
where
you
are
as
a
result
of
which
tomlinson
would
send
his
instructions
he
did
it
all
from
the
rotunda
in
a
way
of
his
own
that
he
had
evolved
with
a
telegraph
clerk
who
told
him
the
names
of
brokers
and
he
dealt
thus
through
brokers
whom
he
never
saw
as
a
result
of
this
the
sluggish
and
would
take
as
sudden
a
leap
into
the
air
as
might
a
mule
with
a
galvanic
shock
applied
to
its
tail
at
once
the
word
was
whispered
that
the
tomlinson
interests
were
after
the
to
reorganize
it
and
the
whole
floor
of
the
exchange
scrambled
for
the
stock
and
so
it
was
that
after
a
month
or
two
of
these
operations
the
wizard
of
finance
saw
himself
beaten
it
no
good
mother
he
repeated
it
just
a
kind
of
destiny
destiny
perhaps
it
was
but
if
the
wizard
of
finance
had
known
it
at
this
very
moment
when
he
sat
with
the
aladdin
palace
of
his
golden
fortune
reared
so
strangely
about
him
destiny
was
preparing
for
him
still
stranger
things
destiny
so
it
would
seem
was
devising
its
own
ways
and
means
of
dealing
with
tomlinson
fortune
as
one
of
the
ways
and
means
destiny
was
sending
at
this
moment
as
its
special
emissaries
two
huge
portly
figures
wearing
gigantic
goloshes
and
striding
downwards
from
the
halls
of
plutoria
university
to
the
grand
palaver
hotel
and
one
of
these
was
the
gigantic
boomer
the
president
of
the
college
and
the
other
was
his
professor
of
greek
almost
as
gigantic
as
himself
and
they
carried
in
their
capacious
pockets
bundles
of
pamphlets
on
archaeological
remains
of
mitylene
and
the
use
of
the
greek
pluperfect
and
little
treatises
such
as
education
and
philanthropy
by
boomer
and
the
excavation
of
mitylene
an
estimate
of
cost
by
boyster
boomer
on
the
foundation
and
maintenance
of
chairs
etc
many
a
man
in
city
finance
who
had
seen
boomer
enter
his
office
with
a
bundle
of
these
monographs
and
a
fighting
glitter
in
his
eyes
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
in
dismay
for
it
meant
that
boomer
had
tracked
him
out
for
a
benefaction
to
the
university
and
that
all
resistance
was
hopeless
when
boomer
once
laid
upon
a
capitalist
desk
his
famous
pamphlet
on
the
use
of
the
greek
pluperfect
it
was
as
if
an
arabian
sultan
had
sent
the
fatal
to
a
condemned
pasha
or
morgan
the
buccaneer
had
served
the
on
a
shuddering
pirate
so
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
shouldering
the
the
sound
of
them
as
they
talked
was
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
as
homer
heard
it
never
did
castor
and
pollux
come
surging
into
battle
as
boomer
and
boyster
bore
down
upon
the
grand
palaver
hotel
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
had
hesitated
about
going
to
the
university
the
university
was
coming
to
him
as
for
those
millions
of
his
he
could
take
his
choice
dormitories
apparatus
campuses
buildings
endowment
anything
he
liked
but
choose
he
must
and
if
he
feared
that
after
all
his
fortune
was
too
vast
even
for
such
a
disposal
boomer
would
show
him
how
he
might
use
it
in
digging
up
ancient
mitylene
or
modern
smyrna
or
the
lost
cities
of
the
plain
of
pactolus
if
the
size
of
the
fortune
troubled
him
boomer
would
dig
him
up
the
whole
african
sahara
from
alexandria
to
morocco
and
ask
for
more
but
if
destiny
held
all
this
for
tomlinson
in
its
outstretched
palm
before
it
it
concealed
stranger
things
still
beneath
the
folds
of
its
toga
there
were
enough
surprises
there
to
turn
the
faces
of
the
whole
directorate
of
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
as
yellow
as
the
gold
they
mined
for
at
this
very
moment
while
the
president
of
plutoria
university
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
grand
palaver
hotel
the
senior
professor
of
geology
was
working
again
beside
the
blue
flames
in
his
darkened
laboratory
and
this
time
there
was
no
shaking
excitement
over
him
nor
were
the
labels
that
he
marked
as
sample
followed
sample
in
the
tests
the
same
as
those
of
the
previous
marking
not
by
any
means
and
his
grave
face
as
he
worked
in
silence
was
as
still
as
the
stones
of
the
period
chapter
three
the
arrested
philanthropy
of
tomlinson
this
tomlinson
is
our
campus
said
president
boomer
as
they
passed
through
the
iron
gates
of
plutoria
university
for
camping
said
the
wizard
not
exactly
answered
the
president
though
it
would
of
course
suit
for
that
humunum
eh
and
he
broke
into
a
loud
explosive
laugh
while
his
spectacles
irradiated
that
peculiar
form
of
glee
derived
from
a
latin
quotation
by
those
able
to
enjoy
it
boyster
walking
on
the
other
side
of
tomlinson
joined
in
the
laugh
in
a
deep
reverberating
chorus
the
two
had
the
wizard
of
finance
between
them
and
they
were
marching
him
up
to
the
university
he
was
taken
along
much
as
is
an
arrested
man
who
has
promised
to
go
quietly
they
kept
their
hands
off
him
but
they
watched
him
sideways
through
their
spectacles
at
the
least
sign
of
restlessness
they
doused
him
with
latin
the
wizard
of
finance
having
been
marked
out
by
boomer
and
boyster
as
a
prospective
benefactor
was
having
latin
poured
over
him
to
reduce
him
to
the
proper
degree
of
plasticity
they
had
already
put
him
through
the
first
stage
they
had
three
days
ago
called
on
him
at
the
grand
palaver
and
served
him
with
a
pamphlet
on
the
excavation
of
mitylene
as
a
sort
of
writ
tomlinson
and
his
wife
had
looked
at
the
pictures
of
the
ruins
and
from
the
appearance
of
them
they
judged
that
mitylene
was
in
mexico
and
they
said
that
it
was
a
shame
to
see
it
in
that
state
and
that
the
united
states
ought
to
intervene
as
the
second
stage
on
the
path
of
philanthropy
the
wizard
of
finance
was
now
being
taken
to
look
at
the
university
boomer
knew
by
experience
that
no
rich
man
could
look
at
it
without
wanting
to
give
it
money
and
here
the
president
had
found
that
there
is
no
better
method
of
dealing
with
businessmen
than
to
use
latin
on
them
for
other
purposes
the
president
used
other
things
for
example
at
a
friendly
dinner
at
the
mausoleum
club
where
light
conversation
was
in
order
boomer
chatted
as
has
been
seen
on
the
archaeological
remains
of
the
navajos
in
the
same
way
at
dante
luncheons
he
generally
talked
of
the
italian
and
whether
gian
gobbo
della
scala
had
left
a
greater
name
than
can
grande
della
spiggiola
but
such
talk
as
that
was
naturally
only
for
women
businessmen
are
much
too
shrewd
for
that
kind
of
thing
in
fact
so
shrewd
are
they
as
president
boomer
had
long
since
discovered
that
nothing
pleases
them
so
much
as
the
quiet
firm
assumption
that
they
know
latin
it
is
like
writing
them
up
an
asset
so
it
was
that
boomer
would
greet
a
business
acquaintance
with
a
roaring
salutation
of
quaterque
or
stand
wringing
his
hand
off
to
the
tune
of
et
presidium
et
dulce
decus
this
caught
them
every
time
you
do
said
tomlinson
the
wizard
in
a
hesitating
tone
as
he
looked
at
the
smooth
grass
of
the
campus
i
suppose
raise
anything
on
it
no
no
this
is
only
for
field
sports
said
the
president
quos
to
which
boyster
on
the
other
side
added
like
a
chorus
this
was
their
favourite
quotation
it
always
gave
president
boomer
a
chance
to
speak
of
the
final
letter
m
in
latin
poetry
and
to
say
that
in
his
opinion
the
elision
of
the
final
m
was
more
properly
a
dropping
of
the
vowel
with
a
repercussion
of
the
two
last
consonants
he
supported
this
by
quoting
ammianus
at
which
boyster
exclaimed
pooh
ammianus
more
dog
latin
and
appealed
to
tomlinson
as
to
whether
any
rational
man
nowadays
cared
what
ammianus
thought
to
all
of
which
tomlinson
answered
never
a
word
but
looked
steadily
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
boomer
said
afterwards
that
the
penetration
of
tomlinson
was
wonderful
and
that
it
was
excellent
to
see
how
boyster
tried
in
vain
to
draw
him
and
boyster
said
afterwards
that
the
way
in
which
tomlinson
quietly
refused
to
be
led
on
by
boomer
was
delicious
and
that
it
was
a
pity
that
aristophanes
was
not
there
to
do
it
justice
all
of
which
was
happening
as
they
went
in
at
the
iron
gates
and
up
the
elm
avenue
of
plutoria
university
the
university
as
everyone
knows
stands
with
its
great
gates
on
plutoria
avenue
and
with
its
largest
buildings
those
of
the
faculties
of
industrial
and
mechanical
science
fronting
full
upon
the
street
these
buildings
are
exceptionally
fine
standing
fifteen
stories
high
and
comparing
favourably
with
the
best
departmental
stores
or
factories
in
the
city
indeed
after
nightfall
when
they
are
all
lighted
up
for
the
evening
technical
classes
and
when
their
testing
machinery
is
in
full
swing
and
there
are
students
going
in
and
out
in
overall
suits
people
have
often
mistaken
the
university
or
this
newer
part
of
it
for
a
factory
a
foreign
visitor
once
said
that
the
students
looked
like
plumbers
and
president
boomer
was
so
proud
of
it
that
he
put
the
phrase
into
his
next
commencement
address
and
from
there
the
newspapers
got
it
and
the
associated
press
took
it
up
and
sent
it
all
over
the
united
states
with
the
heading
have
appearance
of
plumbers
plutoria
university
congratulated
on
character
of
students
and
it
was
a
proud
day
indeed
for
the
heads
of
the
industrial
science
faculty
but
the
older
part
of
the
university
stands
so
quietly
and
modestly
at
the
top
end
of
the
elm
avenue
so
hidden
by
the
leaves
of
it
that
no
one
could
mistake
it
for
a
factory
this
indeed
was
once
the
whole
university
and
had
stood
there
since
colonial
days
under
the
name
concordia
college
it
had
been
filled
with
generations
of
presidents
and
professors
of
the
older
type
with
long
white
beards
and
rusty
black
clothes
and
salaries
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
but
the
change
both
of
name
and
of
character
from
concordia
college
to
plutoria
university
was
the
work
of
president
boomer
he
had
changed
it
from
an
college
of
the
type
to
a
university
in
the
true
modern
sense
at
plutoria
they
now
taught
everything
concordia
college
for
example
had
no
teaching
of
religion
except
lectures
on
the
bible
now
they
had
lectures
also
on
confucianism
mohammedanism
buddhism
with
an
optional
course
on
atheism
for
students
in
the
final
year
and
of
course
they
had
long
since
admitted
women
and
there
were
now
beautiful
creatures
with
cleo
de
merode
hair
studying
astronomy
at
oaken
desks
and
looking
up
at
the
teacher
with
eyes
like
comets
the
university
taught
everything
and
did
everything
it
had
whirling
machines
on
the
top
of
it
that
measured
the
speed
of
the
wind
and
deep
in
its
basements
it
measured
earthquakes
with
a
seismograph
it
held
classes
on
forestry
and
dentistry
and
palmistry
it
sent
life
classes
into
the
slums
and
death
classes
to
the
city
morgue
it
offered
such
a
vast
variety
of
themes
topics
and
subjects
to
the
students
that
there
was
nothing
that
a
student
was
compelled
to
learn
while
from
its
own
presses
in
its
own
it
sent
out
a
shower
of
bulletins
and
monographs
like
driven
snow
from
a
rotary
plough
in
fact
it
had
become
as
president
boomer
told
all
the
businessmen
in
town
not
merely
a
university
but
a
in
the
true
sense
and
every
one
of
its
faculties
was
now
a
in
the
real
acceptance
of
the
word
and
its
studies
properly
and
truly
indeed
if
the
businessmen
would
only
build
a
few
more
dormitories
and
put
up
enough
money
to
form
an
adequate
or
then
the
good
work
might
be
looked
upon
as
complete
as
the
three
walked
up
the
elm
avenue
there
met
them
a
little
stream
of
students
with
college
books
and
female
students
with
hats
and
professors
with
last
year
overcoats
and
some
went
past
with
a
smile
and
others
with
a
shiver
that
professor
withers
said
the
president
in
a
sympathetic
voice
as
one
of
the
shivering
figures
went
past
poor
withers
and
he
sighed
what
wrong
with
him
said
the
wizard
is
he
sick
no
not
sick
said
the
president
quietly
and
sadly
merely
inefficient
inefficient
unfortunately
so
mind
you
i
do
mean
in
every
sense
by
no
means
if
anyone
were
to
come
to
me
and
say
can
you
put
your
hand
for
me
on
a
botanist
i
say
withers
i
say
it
in
a
minute
this
was
true
he
would
have
in
fact
if
anyone
had
made
this
kind
of
rash
speech
boomer
would
have
given
away
half
the
professoriate
well
what
wrong
with
him
repeated
tomlinson
i
suppose
he
quite
up
to
the
mark
in
some
ways
eh
precisely
said
the
president
not
quite
up
to
the
mark
a
very
happy
way
of
putting
it
imperii
nisi
as
no
doubt
you
are
thinking
to
yourself
the
fact
is
that
withers
though
an
excellent
fellow
ca
manage
large
classes
with
small
classes
he
is
all
right
but
with
large
classes
the
man
is
lost
he
ca
handle
them
he
ca
eh
said
the
wizard
no
but
what
can
i
do
there
he
is
i
ca
dismiss
him
i
pension
him
i
no
money
for
it
here
the
president
slackened
a
little
in
his
walk
and
looked
sideways
at
the
prospective
benefactor
but
tomlinson
gave
no
sign
a
second
professorial
figure
passed
them
on
the
other
side
there
again
said
the
president
that
another
case
of
inefficiency
professor
shottat
our
senior
professor
of
english
what
wrong
with
asked
the
wizard
he
ca
handle
classes
said
the
president
with
large
classes
he
is
really
excellent
but
with
small
ones
the
man
is
simply
hopeless
in
this
fashion
before
tomlinson
had
measured
the
length
of
the
avenue
he
had
had
ample
opportunity
to
judge
of
the
crying
need
of
money
at
plutoria
university
and
of
the
perplexity
of
its
president
he
was
shown
professors
who
could
handle
the
first
year
but
were
powerless
with
the
second
others
who
were
all
right
with
the
second
but
broke
down
with
the
third
while
others
could
handle
the
third
but
collapsed
with
the
fourth
there
were
professors
who
were
all
right
in
their
own
subject
but
perfectly
impossible
outside
of
it
others
who
were
so
occupied
outside
of
their
own
subject
that
they
were
useless
inside
of
it
others
who
knew
their
subject
but
could
lecture
and
others
again
who
lectured
admirably
but
did
know
their
subject
in
short
it
was
clear
as
it
was
meant
to
be
that
the
need
of
the
moment
was
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
enable
the
president
to
dismiss
everybody
but
himself
and
boyster
the
latter
stood
in
a
class
all
by
himself
he
had
known
the
president
for
years
ever
since
he
was
a
fat
little
boy
with
spectacles
in
a
classical
academy
stuffing
himself
on
irregular
greek
verbs
as
readily
as
if
on
oysters
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
need
for
dismissing
the
professors
was
only
part
of
the
trouble
there
were
the
buildings
to
consider
this
i
am
ashamed
to
say
said
boomer
as
they
passed
the
imitation
greek
portico
of
the
old
concordia
college
building
is
our
original
home
the
et
of
our
studies
our
faculty
of
arts
it
was
indeed
a
dilapidated
building
yet
there
was
a
certain
majesty
about
it
too
especially
when
one
reflected
that
it
had
been
standing
there
looking
much
the
same
at
the
time
when
its
students
had
trooped
off
in
a
flock
to
join
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
much
the
same
indeed
three
generations
before
that
when
the
classes
were
closed
and
the
students
clapped
hats
on
their
heads
and
were
off
to
enlist
as
minute
men
with
flintlock
muskets
under
general
washington
but
boomer
one
idea
was
to
knock
the
building
down
and
to
build
on
its
site
a
real
ten
storeys
high
with
elevators
in
it
tomlinson
looked
about
him
humbly
as
he
stood
in
the
main
hall
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
awed
him
there
were
bulletins
and
and
notices
stuck
on
the
walls
that
gave
evidence
of
the
activity
of
the
place
professor
slithers
will
be
unable
to
meet
his
classes
today
ran
one
of
them
and
another
professor
withers
will
not
meet
his
classes
this
week
and
another
owing
to
illness
professor
shottat
will
not
lecture
this
month
while
still
another
announced
owing
to
the
indisposition
of
professor
podge
all
botanical
classes
are
suspended
but
professor
podge
hopes
to
be
able
to
join
in
the
botanical
picnic
excursion
to
loon
lake
on
saturday
afternoon
you
could
judge
of
the
grinding
routine
of
the
work
from
the
nature
of
these
notices
anyone
familiar
with
the
work
of
colleges
would
not
heed
it
but
it
shocked
tomlinson
to
think
how
often
the
professors
of
the
college
were
stricken
down
by
overwork
here
and
there
in
the
hall
set
into
niches
were
bronze
busts
of
men
with
roman
faces
and
bare
necks
and
the
edge
of
a
toga
cast
over
each
shoulder
who
would
these
be
asked
tomlinson
pointing
at
them
some
of
the
chief
founders
and
benefactors
of
the
faculty
answered
the
president
and
at
this
the
hopes
of
tomlinson
sank
in
his
heart
for
he
realized
the
class
of
man
one
had
to
belong
to
in
order
to
be
accepted
as
a
university
benefactor
a
splendid
group
of
men
are
they
not
said
the
president
we
owe
them
much
this
is
the
late
hogworth
a
man
of
singularly
large
heart
here
he
pointed
to
a
bronze
figure
wearing
a
wreath
of
laurel
and
inscribed
guliemus
hogworth
litt
doc
he
had
made
a
great
fortune
in
the
produce
business
and
wishing
to
mark
his
gratitude
to
the
community
he
erected
the
anemometer
the
on
the
roof
of
the
building
attaching
to
it
no
other
condition
than
that
his
name
should
be
printed
in
the
weekly
reports
immediately
beside
the
velocity
of
the
wind
the
figure
beside
him
is
the
late
underbugg
who
founded
our
lectures
on
the
four
gospels
on
the
sole
stipulation
that
henceforth
any
reference
of
ours
to
the
four
gospels
should
be
coupled
with
his
name
what
that
after
his
name
asked
tomlinson
litt
said
the
president
doctor
of
letters
our
honorary
degree
we
are
always
happy
to
grant
it
to
our
benefactors
by
a
vote
of
the
faculty
here
boomer
and
boyster
wheeled
half
round
and
looked
quietly
and
steadily
at
the
wizard
of
finance
to
both
their
minds
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
an
honourable
bargain
was
being
struck
yes
tomlinson
said
the
president
as
they
emerged
from
the
building
no
doubt
you
begin
to
realize
our
unhappy
position
money
money
money
he
repeated
if
i
had
the
money
i
have
that
whole
building
down
and
dismantled
in
a
fortnight
from
the
central
building
the
three
passed
to
the
museum
building
where
tomlinson
was
shown
a
vast
skeleton
of
a
diplodocus
maximus
and
was
specially
warned
not
to
confuse
it
with
the
dinosaurus
perfectus
whose
bones
however
could
be
bought
if
anyone
any
man
of
large
heart
would
come
to
the
university
and
say
straight
out
gentlemen
what
can
i
do
for
you
better
still
it
appeared
the
whole
museum
which
was
hopelessly
antiquated
being
years
old
could
be
entirely
knocked
down
if
a
sufficient
sum
was
forthcoming
and
its
curator
who
was
as
ancient
as
the
dinosaurus
itself
could
be
dismissed
on
if
any
man
had
a
heart
large
enough
for
the
dismissal
from
the
museum
they
passed
to
the
library
where
there
were
portraits
of
more
founders
and
benefactors
in
long
red
robes
holding
scrolls
of
paper
and
others
sitting
holding
pens
and
writing
on
parchment
with
a
greek
temple
and
a
thunderstorm
in
the
background
and
here
again
it
appeared
that
the
crying
need
of
the
moment
was
for
someone
to
come
to
the
university
and
say
gentlemen
what
can
i
do
for
you
on
which
the
whole
library
for
it
was
twenty
years
old
and
out
of
date
might
be
blown
up
with
dynamite
and
carted
away
but
at
all
this
the
hopes
of
tomlinson
sank
lower
and
lower
the
red
robes
and
the
scrolls
were
too
much
for
him
from
the
library
they
passed
to
the
tall
buildings
that
housed
the
faculty
of
industrial
and
mechanical
science
and
here
again
the
same
pitiful
lack
of
money
was
everywhere
apparent
for
example
in
the
physical
science
department
there
was
a
mass
of
apparatus
for
which
the
university
was
unable
to
afford
suitable
premises
and
in
the
chemical
department
there
were
vast
premises
for
which
the
university
was
unable
to
buy
apparatus
and
so
on
indeed
it
was
part
of
boomer
method
to
get
himself
endowed
first
with
premises
too
big
for
the
apparatus
and
then
by
appealing
to
public
spirit
to
call
for
enough
apparatus
to
more
than
fill
the
premises
by
means
of
which
system
industrial
science
at
plutoria
university
advanced
with
increasing
and
gigantic
strides
but
most
of
all
the
electric
department
interested
the
wizard
of
finance
and
this
time
his
voice
lost
its
hesitating
tone
and
he
looked
straight
at
boomer
as
he
began
i
have
a
boy
ah
said
boomer
with
a
huge
ejaculation
of
surprise
and
relief
you
have
a
boy
there
were
volumes
in
his
tone
what
it
meant
was
now
indeed
we
have
got
you
where
we
want
you
and
he
exchanged
a
meaning
look
with
the
professor
of
greek
within
five
minutes
the
president
and
tomlinson
and
boyster
were
gravely
discussing
on
what
terms
and
in
what
way
fred
might
be
admitted
to
study
in
the
faculty
of
industrial
science
the
president
on
learning
that
fred
had
put
in
four
years
in
cahoga
county
section
no
school
and
had
been
head
of
his
class
in
ciphering
nodded
his
head
gravely
and
said
it
would
simply
be
a
matter
of
a
that
in
fact
he
felt
sure
that
fred
might
be
admitted
but
the
real
condition
on
which
they
meant
to
admit
him
was
of
course
not
mentioned
one
door
only
in
the
faculty
of
industrial
and
mechanical
science
they
did
not
pass
a
heavy
oak
door
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
bearing
the
painted
inscription
geological
and
metallurgical
laboratories
stuck
in
the
door
was
a
card
with
the
words
they
were
conceived
in
the
courteous
phrases
of
mechanical
science
which
is
almost
a
branch
of
business
in
the
real
sense
busy
keep
out
boomer
looked
at
the
card
ah
yes
he
said
gildas
is
no
doubt
busy
with
his
tests
we
wo
disturb
him
the
president
was
always
proud
to
find
a
professor
busy
it
looked
well
but
if
boomer
had
known
what
was
going
on
behind
the
oaken
door
of
the
department
of
geology
and
metallurgy
he
would
have
felt
considerably
disturbed
himself
for
here
again
gildas
senior
professor
of
geology
was
working
among
his
blue
flames
at
a
final
test
on
which
depended
the
fate
of
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
and
all
connected
with
it
before
him
there
were
some
twenty
or
thirty
packets
of
crumpled
dust
and
splintered
ore
that
glittered
on
the
it
had
been
taken
up
from
the
creek
along
its
whole
length
at
even
spaces
twenty
yards
apart
by
an
expert
sent
down
in
haste
by
the
directorate
after
gildas
second
report
and
heavily
bribed
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
as
professor
gildas
stood
and
worked
at
the
samples
and
tied
them
up
after
analysis
in
little
white
cardboard
boxes
he
marked
each
one
very
carefully
and
neatly
with
the
words
pyrites
worthless
beside
the
professor
worked
a
young
demonstrator
of
last
graduation
class
it
was
he
in
fact
who
had
written
the
polite
notice
on
the
card
what
is
the
stuff
anyway
he
asked
a
sulphuret
of
iron
said
the
professor
or
iron
pyrites
in
colour
and
appearance
it
is
practically
identical
with
gold
indeed
in
all
ages
he
went
on
dropping
at
once
into
the
classroom
tone
and
adopting
the
professional
habit
of
jumping
backwards
twenty
centuries
in
order
to
explain
anything
properly
it
has
been
readily
mistaken
for
the
precious
metal
the
ancients
called
it
gold
martin
frobisher
brought
back
four
shiploads
of
it
from
baffin
land
thinking
that
he
had
discovered
an
eldorado
there
are
large
deposits
of
it
in
the
mines
of
cornwall
and
it
is
just
possible
here
the
professor
measured
his
words
as
if
speaking
of
something
that
he
promise
that
the
cassiterides
of
the
phoenicians
contained
deposits
of
the
same
sulphuret
indeed
i
defy
anyone
he
continued
for
he
was
piqued
in
his
scientific
pride
to
distinguish
it
from
gold
without
a
in
large
quantities
i
concede
its
lack
of
weight
would
betray
it
to
a
trained
hand
but
without
testing
its
solubility
in
nitric
acid
or
the
fact
of
its
burning
with
a
blue
flame
under
the
it
can
not
be
detected
in
short
when
crystallized
in
dodecahedrons
is
it
any
good
broke
in
the
demonstrator
good
said
the
professor
oh
you
mean
commercially
not
in
the
slightest
much
less
valuable
than
let
us
say
ordinary
mud
or
clay
in
fact
it
is
absolutely
good
for
nothing
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
watching
the
blue
flames
above
the
brazier
then
gildas
spoke
again
oddly
enough
he
said
the
first
set
of
samples
were
undoubtedly
pure
gold
not
the
faintest
doubt
of
that
that
is
the
really
interesting
part
of
the
matter
these
gentlemen
concerned
in
the
enterprise
will
of
course
lose
their
money
and
i
shall
therefore
decline
to
accept
the
very
handsome
fee
which
they
had
offered
me
for
my
services
but
the
main
feature
the
real
point
of
interest
in
this
matter
remains
here
we
have
undoubtedly
a
sporadic
deposit
what
miners
call
a
pocket
of
pure
gold
in
a
devonian
formation
of
the
period
this
once
established
we
must
revise
our
entire
theory
of
the
distribution
of
igneous
and
aqueous
rocks
in
fact
i
am
already
getting
notes
together
for
a
paper
for
the
under
the
heading
auriferous
excretions
in
the
devonian
strata
a
working
hypothesis
i
hope
to
read
it
at
the
next
meeting
the
young
demonstrator
looked
at
the
professor
with
one
eye
i
do
think
i
would
if
i
were
you
he
said
now
this
young
demonstrator
knew
nothing
or
practically
nothing
of
geology
because
he
came
of
one
of
the
richest
and
best
families
in
town
and
did
need
to
but
he
was
a
smart
young
man
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
with
brown
boots
and
a
crosswise
tie
and
he
knew
more
about
money
and
business
and
the
stock
exchange
in
five
minutes
than
professor
gildas
in
his
whole
existence
why
not
said
the
professor
why
do
you
see
what
happened
eh
said
gildas
what
happened
to
those
first
samples
when
that
bunch
got
interested
and
planned
to
float
the
company
do
you
see
somebody
salted
them
on
you
them
on
me
repeated
the
professor
mystified
yes
salted
them
somebody
got
wise
to
what
they
were
and
swopped
them
on
you
for
the
real
thing
so
as
to
get
your
certified
report
that
the
stuff
was
gold
i
begin
to
see
muttered
the
professor
somebody
exchanged
the
samples
some
person
no
doubt
desirous
of
establishing
the
theory
that
a
sporadic
outcropping
of
the
sort
might
be
found
in
a
formation
i
see
i
see
no
doubt
he
intended
to
prepare
a
paper
on
it
and
prove
his
thesis
by
these
tests
i
see
it
all
the
demonstrator
looked
at
the
professor
with
a
sort
of
pity
you
on
he
said
and
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
well
said
boomer
after
tomlinson
had
left
the
university
what
do
you
make
of
him
the
president
had
taken
boyster
over
to
his
house
beside
the
campus
and
there
in
his
study
had
given
him
a
cigar
as
big
as
a
rope
and
taken
another
himself
this
was
a
sign
that
boomer
wanted
boyster
opinion
in
plain
english
without
any
latin
about
it
remarkable
man
said
the
professor
of
greek
wonderful
penetration
and
a
man
of
very
few
words
of
course
his
game
is
clear
enough
entirely
so
asserted
boomer
it
clear
enough
that
he
means
to
give
the
money
on
two
conditions
exactly
said
the
president
first
that
we
admit
his
son
who
is
quite
unqualified
to
the
senior
studies
in
electrical
science
and
second
that
we
grant
him
the
degree
of
doctor
of
letters
those
are
his
terms
can
we
meet
them
oh
certainly
as
to
the
son
there
is
no
difficulty
of
course
as
to
the
degree
it
only
a
question
of
getting
the
faculty
to
vote
it
i
think
we
can
manage
it
vote
it
they
did
that
very
afternoon
true
if
the
members
of
the
faculty
had
known
the
things
that
were
being
whispered
and
more
than
whispered
in
the
city
about
tomlinson
and
his
fortune
no
degree
would
ever
have
been
conferred
on
him
but
it
so
happened
that
at
that
moment
the
whole
professoriate
was
absorbed
in
one
of
those
great
educational
crises
which
from
time
to
time
shake
a
university
to
its
base
the
meeting
of
the
faculty
that
day
bid
fair
to
lose
all
vestige
of
decorum
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
for
as
dean
elderberry
foible
the
head
of
the
faculty
said
the
motion
that
they
had
before
them
amounted
practically
to
a
revolution
the
proposal
was
nothing
less
than
the
permission
of
the
use
of
instead
of
pen
and
ink
in
the
sessional
examinations
of
the
university
anyone
conversant
with
the
inner
life
of
a
college
will
realize
that
to
many
of
the
professoriate
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
last
wild
onslaught
of
socialistic
democracy
against
the
solid
bulwarks
of
society
they
must
fight
it
back
or
die
on
the
walls
to
others
it
was
one
more
step
in
the
splendid
progress
of
democratic
education
comparable
only
to
such
things
as
the
abandonment
of
the
cap
and
gown
and
the
omission
of
the
word
sir
in
speaking
to
a
professor
no
wonder
that
the
fight
raged
elderberry
foible
his
fluffed
white
hair
almost
on
end
beat
in
vain
with
his
gavel
for
order
finally
chang
of
physiology
who
was
a
perfect
dynamo
of
energy
and
was
known
frequently
to
work
for
three
or
four
hours
at
a
stretch
proposed
that
the
faculty
should
adjourn
the
question
and
meet
for
its
further
discussion
on
the
following
saturday
morning
this
revolutionary
suggestion
involving
work
on
saturday
reduced
the
meeting
to
a
mere
turmoil
in
the
midst
of
which
elderberry
foible
proposed
that
the
whole
question
of
the
use
of
should
be
adjourned
till
that
day
six
months
and
that
meantime
a
new
special
committee
of
seventeen
professors
with
power
to
add
to
their
number
to
call
witnesses
and
if
need
be
to
hear
them
should
report
on
the
entire
matter
this
motion
after
the
striking
out
of
the
words
and
the
insertion
of
was
finally
carried
after
which
the
faculty
sank
back
completely
exhausted
into
its
chair
the
need
of
afternoon
tea
and
toast
stamped
on
every
face
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
president
boomer
who
understood
faculties
as
few
men
have
done
quietly
entered
the
room
laid
his
silk
hat
on
a
volume
of
demosthenes
and
proposed
the
vote
of
a
degree
of
doctor
of
letters
for
edward
tomlinson
he
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
remind
the
faculty
of
tomlinson
services
to
the
nation
they
knew
them
of
the
members
of
the
faculty
indeed
some
thought
that
he
meant
the
tomlinson
who
wrote
the
famous
monologue
on
the
iota
subscript
while
others
supposed
that
he
referred
to
the
celebrated
philosopher
tomlinson
whose
new
book
on
the
indivisibility
of
the
inseparable
was
just
then
maddening
the
entire
world
in
any
case
they
voted
the
degree
without
a
word
still
faint
with
exhaustion
but
while
the
university
was
conferring
on
tomlinson
the
degree
of
doctor
of
letters
all
over
the
city
in
business
circles
they
were
conferring
on
him
far
other
titles
idiot
scoundrel
swindler
were
the
least
of
them
every
stock
and
share
with
which
his
name
was
known
to
be
connected
was
coming
down
with
a
run
wiping
out
the
accumulated
profits
of
the
wizard
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
dollars
a
minute
they
not
only
questioned
his
honesty
but
they
went
further
and
questioned
his
business
capacity
the
man
said
lucullus
fyshe
sitting
in
the
mausoleum
club
and
breathing
freely
at
last
after
having
disposed
of
all
his
holdings
in
the
erie
auriferous
is
an
ignoramus
i
asked
him
only
the
other
day
quite
casually
a
perfectly
simple
business
question
i
said
to
him
bonds
have
risen
and
a
half
in
a
week
you
know
and
i
know
that
they
are
only
collateral
trust
and
that
the
stock
underneath
never
could
and
never
would
earn
a
par
dividend
now
i
said
for
i
wanted
to
test
the
fellow
me
what
that
means
would
you
believe
me
he
looked
me
right
in
the
face
in
that
stupid
way
of
his
and
he
said
do
know
he
said
he
did
know
repeated
the
listener
contemptuously
the
man
is
a
damn
fool
the
reason
of
all
this
was
that
the
results
of
the
researches
of
the
professor
of
geology
were
being
whispered
among
the
directorate
of
the
erie
auriferous
and
the
directors
and
chief
shareholders
were
busily
performing
the
interesting
process
called
unloading
nor
did
ever
a
farmer
of
cahoga
county
in
haying
time
with
a
thunderstorm
threatening
unload
with
greater
rapidity
than
did
the
major
shareholders
of
the
auriferous
lucullus
fyshe
traded
off
a
quarter
of
his
stock
to
an
unwary
member
of
the
mausoleum
club
at
a
drop
of
thirty
per
cent
and
being
too
prudent
to
hold
the
rest
on
any
terms
he
conveyed
it
at
once
as
a
benefaction
in
trust
to
the
plutorian
orphans
and
home
while
the
purchaser
of
fyshe
stock
learning
too
late
of
his
folly
rushed
for
his
lawyers
to
have
the
shares
conveyed
as
a
gift
to
the
home
for
incurables
asmodeus
boulder
transferred
his
entire
holdings
to
the
relief
society
and
furlong
senior
passed
his
over
to
a
chinese
mission
as
fast
as
pen
could
traverse
paper
down
at
the
office
of
skinyer
and
beatem
the
lawyers
of
the
company
they
were
working
overtime
drawing
up
deeds
and
conveyances
and
trusts
in
perpetuity
with
hardly
time
to
put
them
into
typewriting
within
hours
the
entire
stock
of
the
company
bid
fair
to
be
in
the
hands
of
idiots
orphans
protestants
foundlings
imbeciles
missionaries
chinese
and
other
unfinancial
people
with
tomlinson
the
wizard
of
finance
as
the
senior
shareholder
and
majority
control
and
whether
the
gentle
wizard
as
he
sat
with
mother
planning
his
vast
benefaction
to
plutoria
university
would
have
felt
more
at
home
with
his
new
group
of
than
his
old
it
were
hard
to
say
but
meantime
at
the
office
of
skinyer
and
beatem
all
was
activity
for
not
only
were
they
drafting
the
conveyances
of
the
perpetual
trusts
as
fast
as
legal
brains
working
overtime
could
do
it
but
in
another
part
of
the
office
a
section
of
the
firm
were
busily
making
their
preparations
against
the
expected
actions
for
fraud
and
warrants
of
distraint
and
injunctions
against
disposal
of
assets
and
the
whole
battery
of
artillery
which
might
open
on
them
at
any
moment
and
they
worked
like
a
corps
of
military
engineers
fortifying
an
escarpment
with
the
joy
of
battle
in
their
faces
the
storm
might
break
at
any
moment
already
at
the
office
of
the
the
type
was
set
for
a
special
extra
with
a
heading
three
inches
high
collapse
of
the
erie
consolidated
arrest
of
the
man
tomlinson
expected
this
afternoon
skinyer
and
beatem
had
paid
the
editor
who
was
crooked
two
thousand
dollars
cash
to
hold
back
that
extra
for
hours
and
the
editor
had
paid
the
reporting
staff
who
were
crooked
dollars
each
to
keep
the
news
quiet
and
the
compositors
who
were
also
crooked
ten
dollars
per
man
to
hold
their
mouths
shut
till
the
morning
with
the
result
that
from
editors
and
and
reporters
and
compositors
the
news
went
seething
forth
in
a
flood
that
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
was
going
to
shatter
into
fragments
like
the
bursting
of
a
dynamite
bomb
it
rushed
with
a
thousand
whispering
tongues
from
street
to
street
till
it
filled
the
corridors
of
the
law
courts
and
the
lobbies
of
the
offices
and
till
every
honest
man
that
held
a
share
of
the
stock
shivered
in
his
tracks
and
reached
out
to
give
sell
or
destroy
it
only
the
unwinking
idiots
and
the
mild
orphans
and
the
calm
deaf
mutes
and
the
impassive
chinese
held
tight
to
what
they
had
so
gathered
the
storm
till
all
the
town
like
the
great
rotunda
of
the
grand
palaver
was
filled
with
a
silent
call
for
tomlinson
voiceless
and
ominous
and
while
all
this
was
happening
and
while
at
skinyer
and
they
worked
with
frantic
pens
and
clattering
type
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
hesitant
and
uncertain
and
before
the
eyes
of
the
astounded
office
there
stood
in
his
hat
and
long
black
coat
the
figure
of
the
man
tomlinson
himself
and
skinyer
the
senior
partner
no
sooner
heard
what
tomlinson
wanted
than
he
dashed
across
the
outer
office
to
his
partner
room
with
his
hyena
face
all
excitement
as
he
said
beatem
beatem
come
over
to
my
room
this
man
is
absolutely
the
biggest
thing
in
america
for
sheer
calmness
and
nerve
i
never
heard
of
anything
to
approach
him
what
do
you
think
he
wants
to
do
what
said
beatem
why
he
giving
his
entire
fortune
to
the
university
by
gad
ejaculated
beatem
and
the
two
lawyers
looked
at
one
another
lost
in
admiration
of
the
marvellous
genius
and
assurance
of
tomlinson
yet
what
had
happened
was
very
simple
tomlinson
had
come
back
from
the
university
filled
with
mingled
hope
and
hesitation
the
university
he
saw
needed
the
money
and
he
hoped
to
give
it
his
entire
fortune
to
put
boomer
in
a
position
to
practically
destroy
the
whole
place
but
like
many
a
modest
man
he
lacked
the
assurance
to
speak
out
he
felt
that
up
to
the
present
the
benefactors
of
the
university
had
been
men
of
an
entirely
different
class
from
himself
it
was
mother
who
solved
the
situation
for
him
well
father
she
said
there
one
thing
i
learned
already
since
we
had
money
if
you
want
to
get
a
thing
done
you
can
always
find
people
to
do
it
for
you
if
you
pay
them
why
not
go
to
those
lawyers
that
manage
things
for
the
company
and
get
them
to
arrange
it
all
for
you
with
the
college
as
a
result
tomlinson
had
turned
up
at
the
door
of
the
skinyer
and
beatem
office
quite
so
tomlinson
said
skinyer
with
his
pen
already
dipped
in
the
ink
a
perfectly
simple
matter
i
can
draw
up
a
draft
of
conveyance
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pen
in
fact
we
can
do
it
on
the
spot
what
he
meant
was
in
fact
we
can
do
it
so
fast
that
i
can
pocket
a
fee
of
five
hundred
dollars
right
here
and
now
while
you
have
the
money
to
pay
me
now
then
he
continued
let
us
see
how
it
is
to
run
well
said
tomlinson
i
want
you
to
put
it
that
i
give
all
my
stock
in
the
company
to
the
university
all
of
it
said
skinyer
with
a
quiet
smile
to
beatem
every
cent
of
it
sir
said
tomlinson
just
write
down
that
i
give
all
of
it
to
the
college
very
good
said
skinyer
and
he
began
to
write
i
and
of
the
county
of
cahoga
i
think
you
said
mr
tomlinson
yes
sir
said
the
wizard
i
was
raised
there
do
hereby
give
assign
devise
transfer
and
the
transfer
is
hereby
given
devised
and
assigned
all
those
stocks
shares
hereditaments
which
i
hold
in
the
all
several
and
whatever
you
will
observe
tomlinson
i
am
expressing
myself
with
as
great
brevity
as
possible
to
that
institution
academy
college
school
university
now
known
and
reputed
to
be
plutoria
university
of
the
city
of
etc
he
paused
a
moment
now
what
special
objects
or
purposes
shall
i
indicate
he
asked
whereupon
tomlinson
explained
as
best
he
could
and
skinyer
working
with
great
rapidity
indicated
that
the
benefaction
was
to
include
a
demolition
fund
for
the
removal
of
buildings
a
retirement
fund
for
the
removal
of
professors
an
apparatus
fund
for
the
destruction
of
apparatus
and
a
general
sinking
fund
for
the
obliteration
of
anything
not
otherwise
mentioned
and
i
like
to
do
something
if
i
could
for
boomer
himself
just
as
man
to
man
said
tomlinson
all
right
said
beatem
and
he
could
hardly
keep
his
face
straight
give
him
a
chunk
of
the
stock
give
him
half
a
million
i
will
said
tomlinson
he
deserves
it
undoubtedly
said
skinyer
and
within
a
few
minutes
the
whole
transaction
was
done
and
tomlinson
filled
with
joy
was
wringing
the
hands
of
skinyer
and
beatem
and
telling
them
to
name
their
own
fee
they
had
meant
to
anyway
is
that
legal
do
you
suppose
said
beatem
to
skinyer
after
the
wizard
had
gone
will
it
hold
water
oh
i
do
think
so
said
skinyer
not
for
a
minute
in
fact
rather
the
other
way
if
they
make
an
arrest
for
fraudulent
flotation
this
conveyance
i
should
think
would
help
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
but
i
very
much
doubt
if
they
can
arrest
him
mind
you
the
fellow
is
devilish
shrewd
you
know
and
i
know
that
he
planned
this
whole
flotation
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
fraud
and
know
it
very
good
but
we
know
it
more
from
our
trained
instinct
in
such
things
than
by
any
proof
the
fellow
has
managed
to
surround
himself
with
such
an
air
of
good
faith
from
start
to
finish
that
it
will
be
deuced
hard
to
get
at
him
what
will
he
do
now
said
beatem
i
tell
you
what
he
do
mark
my
words
within
hours
he
clear
out
and
be
out
of
the
state
and
if
they
want
to
get
him
they
have
to
extradite
i
tell
you
he
a
man
of
extraordinary
capacity
the
rest
of
us
are
nowhere
beside
him
in
which
perhaps
there
was
some
truth
well
mother
said
the
wizard
when
he
reached
the
suite
after
his
interview
with
skinyer
and
beatem
his
face
irradiated
with
simple
joy
it
done
i
put
the
college
now
in
a
position
it
never
was
in
before
nor
any
other
college
the
lawyers
say
so
themselves
that
good
said
mother
yes
and
it
a
good
thing
i
did
lose
the
money
when
i
tried
to
you
see
mother
what
i
had
realized
was
the
good
that
could
be
done
with
all
that
money
if
a
man
put
his
heart
into
it
they
can
start
in
as
soon
as
they
like
and
tear
down
those
buildings
my
but
it
just
wonderful
what
you
can
do
with
money
i
glad
i
did
lose
it
so
they
talked
far
into
the
evening
that
night
they
slept
in
an
aladdin
palace
filled
with
golden
fancies
and
in
the
morning
the
palace
and
all
its
visions
fell
tumbling
about
their
heads
in
sudden
and
awful
catastrophe
for
with
tomlinson
first
descent
to
the
rotunda
it
broke
the
whole
great
space
seemed
filled
with
the
bulletins
and
the
broadside
sheets
of
the
morning
papers
the
crowd
surging
to
and
fro
buying
the
papers
men
reading
them
as
they
stood
and
everywhere
in
great
letters
there
met
his
eye
collapse
of
the
erie
auriferous
the
great
gold
swindle
arrest
of
the
man
tomlinson
expected
this
morning
so
stood
the
wizard
of
finance
beside
a
pillar
the
paper
fluttering
in
his
hand
his
eyes
fixed
while
about
him
a
thousand
eager
eyes
and
rushing
tongues
sent
shame
into
his
stricken
heart
and
there
his
boy
fred
sent
from
upstairs
found
him
and
at
the
sight
of
the
seething
crowd
and
his
father
stricken
face
aged
as
it
seemed
all
in
a
moment
the
boy
soul
woke
within
him
what
had
happened
he
could
not
tell
only
that
his
father
stood
there
dazed
beaten
and
staring
at
him
on
every
side
in
giant
letters
arrest
of
the
man
tomlinson
come
father
come
upstairs
he
said
and
took
him
by
the
arm
dragging
him
through
the
crowd
in
the
next
as
they
sat
and
waited
for
the
arrest
in
the
false
grandeur
of
the
his
wife
and
boy
learnt
more
than
all
the
teaching
of
the
industrial
faculty
of
plutoria
university
could
have
taught
him
in
a
decade
adversity
laid
its
hand
upon
him
and
at
its
touch
his
adolescent
heart
turned
to
finer
stuff
than
the
salted
gold
of
the
erie
auriferous
as
he
looked
upon
his
father
broken
figure
waiting
meekly
for
arrest
and
his
mother
blubbered
face
a
great
wrath
burned
itself
into
his
soul
when
the
sheriff
comes
said
tomlinson
and
his
lip
trembled
as
he
spoke
he
had
no
other
picture
of
arrest
than
that
they
ca
arrest
you
father
broke
out
the
boy
you
done
nothing
you
never
swindled
them
i
tell
you
if
they
try
to
arrest
you
i
and
his
voice
broke
and
stopped
upon
a
sob
and
his
hands
clenched
in
passion
you
stay
here
you
and
mother
i
go
down
give
me
your
money
and
i
go
and
pay
them
and
we
get
out
of
this
and
go
home
they
stop
us
there
nothing
to
arrest
you
for
nor
was
there
fred
paid
the
bill
unmolested
save
for
the
prying
eyes
and
babbling
tongues
of
the
rotunda
and
a
few
hours
from
that
while
the
town
was
still
ringing
with
news
of
his
downfall
the
wizard
with
his
wife
and
son
walked
down
from
their
suite
into
the
corridor
their
hands
burdened
with
their
satchels
a
waiter
with
something
between
a
sneer
and
an
obsequious
smile
upon
his
face
reached
out
for
the
valises
wondering
if
it
was
still
worth
while
you
get
to
hell
out
of
that
said
fred
he
had
put
on
again
his
rough
store
suit
in
which
he
had
come
from
cahoga
county
and
there
was
a
dangerous
look
about
his
big
shoulders
and
his
set
jaw
and
the
waiter
slunk
back
so
did
they
pass
unarrested
and
unhindered
through
corridor
and
rotunda
to
the
outer
portals
of
the
great
hotel
beside
the
door
of
the
palaver
as
they
passed
out
was
a
tall
official
with
a
uniform
and
a
round
hat
he
was
called
by
the
authorities
a
or
a
or
some
foreign
name
to
mean
that
he
did
nothing
at
the
sight
of
him
the
wizard
face
flushed
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
his
old
perplexity
i
wonder
he
began
to
murmur
how
much
i
ought
not
a
damn
cent
father
said
fred
as
he
shouldered
past
the
magnificent
let
him
work
with
which
admirable
doctrine
the
wizard
and
his
son
passed
from
the
portals
of
the
grand
palaver
nor
was
there
any
arrest
either
then
or
later
in
spite
of
the
expectations
of
the
rotunda
and
the
announcements
of
the
the
man
tomlinson
was
arrested
neither
as
he
left
the
grand
palaver
nor
as
he
stood
waiting
at
the
railroad
station
with
fred
and
mother
for
the
outgoing
train
for
cahoga
county
there
was
nothing
to
arrest
him
for
that
was
not
the
least
strange
part
of
the
career
of
the
wizard
of
finance
for
when
all
the
affairs
of
the
erie
auriferous
consolidated
were
presently
calculated
up
by
the
labours
of
skinyer
and
beatem
and
the
legal
representatives
of
the
orphans
and
the
idiots
and
the
they
resolved
themselves
into
the
most
beautiful
and
complete
cipher
conceivable
the
salted
gold
about
paid
for
the
cost
of
the
incorporation
certificate
the
development
capital
had
disappeared
and
those
who
lost
most
preferred
to
say
the
least
about
it
and
as
for
tomlinson
if
one
added
up
his
gains
on
the
stock
market
before
the
fall
and
subtracted
his
bill
at
the
grand
palaver
and
the
thousand
dollars
which
he
gave
to
skinyer
and
beatem
to
recover
his
freehold
on
the
lower
half
of
his
farm
and
the
cost
of
three
tickets
to
cahoga
station
the
debit
and
credit
account
balanced
to
a
hair
thus
did
the
whole
fortune
of
tomlinson
vanish
in
a
night
even
as
the
golden
palace
seen
in
the
mirage
of
a
desert
sunset
may
fade
before
the
eyes
of
the
beholder
and
leave
no
trace
behind
it
was
some
months
after
the
collapse
of
the
erie
auriferous
that
the
university
conferred
upon
tomlinson
the
degree
of
doctor
of
letters
a
university
must
keep
its
word
and
dean
elderberry
foible
who
was
honesty
itself
had
stubbornly
maintained
that
a
vote
of
the
faculty
of
arts
once
taken
and
written
in
the
minute
book
became
as
irrefragable
as
the
devonian
rock
itself
so
the
degree
was
conferred
and
dean
elderberry
foible
standing
in
a
long
red
gown
before
boomer
seated
in
a
long
blue
gown
read
out
after
the
ancient
custom
of
the

statement
of
the
award
of
the
degree
of

and
a
great
many
other
things
all
ending
in
but
the
recipient
was
not
there
to
receive
he
stood
at
that
moment
with
his
boy
fred
on
a
windy
hillside
beside
lake
erie
where
tomlinson
creek
ran
again
untrammelled
to
the
lake
nor
was
the
scene
altered
to
the
eye
for
tomlinson
and
his
son
had
long
since
broken
a
hole
in
the

with
pickaxe
and
crowbar
and
day
by

the
angry

carried
down
the

all
were

the

of
their

nature
reached
out
its
hand
and
drew
its
coverlet
of
green
over
the
grave
of
the
vanished
eldorado
and
as
the
wizard
and
his
son
stood
upon
the
hillside
they
saw
nothing
but
the
land
sloping
to

and

chapter
four
the
oriental
society
of
lived
on
plutoria
avenue
in
a
vast
sandstone
palace
in
which
she
held
those
fashionable
entertainments
which
have
made
the
name
of
what
it
is
lived
there
also
the
exterior
of
the
house
was
more
or
less
a
model
of
the
facade
of
an
italian
palazzo
of
the
sixteenth
century
if
one
questioned
at
dinner
in
regard
to
this
which
was
only
a
fair
return
for
drinking
five
dollar
champagne
she
answered
that
the
facade
was
but
that
it
reproduced
also
the
saracenic
mullioned
window
of
the
siennese
school
but
if
the
guest
said
later
in
the
evening
to
that
he
understood
that
his
house
was
he
answered
that
he
guessed
it
was
after
which
remark
and
an
interval
of
silence
would
probably
ask
the
guest
if
he
was
dry
so
from
that
one
can
tell
exactly
the
sort
of
people
the
were
in
other
words
was
a
severe
handicap
to
he
was
more
than
that
the
word
is
strong
enough
he
was
as
herself
confessed
to
her
confidential
circle
of
three
hundred
friends
a
drag
he
was
also
a
tie
and
a
weight
and
a
burden
and
in
religious
moments
a
crucifix
even
in
the
early
years
of
their
married
life
some
twenty
or
years
ago
her
husband
had
been
a
drag
on
her
by
being
in
the
coal
and
wood
business
it
is
hard
for
a
woman
to
have
to
realize
that
her
husband
is
making
a
fortune
out
of
coal
and
wood
and
that
people
know
it
it
ties
one
down
what
a
woman
wants
most
of
all
this
of
course
is
merely
a
quotation
from
own
thoughts
as
expressed
to
her
three
hundred
friends
is
room
to
expand
to
grow
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
be
stifled
and
there
is
nothing
more
stifling
than
a
husband
who
does
know
a
giotto
from
a
carlo
dolci
but
who
can
distinguish
nut
coal
from
egg
and
is
never
asked
to
dinner
without
talking
about
the
furnace
these
of
course
were
early
trials
they
had
passed
to
some
extent
or
were
at
any
rate
garlanded
with
the
roses
of
time
but
the
drag
remained
even
when
the
retail
coal
and
wood
stage
was
long
since
over
it
was
hard
to
have
to
put
up
with
a
husband
who
owned
a
coal
mine
and
who
bought
pulp
forests
instead
of
illuminated
missals
of
the
twelfth
century
a
coal
mine
is
a
dreadful
thing
at
a
it
humbles
one
so
before
one
guests
it
would
have
been
so
bad
this
herself
admitted
if
anything
this
phrase
should
be
clearly
understood
it
meant
if
there
was
any
one
thing
that
he
for
instance
if
he
had
only
anything
thus
there
was
lucullus
fyshe
who
made
but
at
the
same
time
everybody
knew
that
he
had
the
best
collection
of
broken
italian
furniture
on
the
continent
there
was
a
sound
piece
among
the
lot
and
there
was
the
similar
example
of
old
feathertop
he
exactly
things
he
repudiated
the
name
he
was
wont
to
say
do
call
me
a
collector
i
i
simply
pick
things
up
just
where
i
happen
to
be
rome
warsaw
bucharest
anywhere
and
it
is
to
be
noted
what
fine
places
these
are
to
happen
to
be
and
to
think
that
would
never
put
his
foot
outside
of
the
united
states
whereas
feathertop
would
come
back
from
what
he
called
a
run
to
europe
and
everybody
would
learn
in
a
week
that
he
had
picked
up
the
back
of
a
violin
in
dresden
actually
discovered
it
in
a
violin
shop
and
the
lid
of
an
etruscan
kettle
he
had
lighted
on
it
by
pure
chance
in
a
kettle
shop
in
etruria
and
would
feel
faint
with
despair
at
the
nonentity
of
her
husband
so
one
can
understand
how
heavy
her
burden
was
my
dear
she
often
said
to
her
bosom
friend
miss
snagg
i
mind
things
so
much
the
things
she
would
mind
were
let
us
say
the
two
million
dollars
of
standing
timber
which
brown
limited
the
ominous
business
name
of
were
buying
that
year
if
anything
but
he
does
every
morning
after
breakfast
off
to
his
wretched
office
and
never
back
till
dinner
and
in
the
evening
nothing
but
his
club
or
some
business
meeting
one
would
think
he
would
have
more
ambition
how
i
wish
i
had
been
a
man
it
was
certainly
a
shame
so
it
came
that
in
almost
everything
she
undertook
had
to
act
without
the
least
help
from
her
husband
every
wednesday
for
instance
when
the
dante
club
met
at
her
house
they
selected
four
lines
each
week
to
meditate
on
and
then
discussed
them
at
lunch
had
to
carry
the
whole
burden
of
it
her
very
phrase
the
whole
burden
alone
anyone
who
has
carried
four
lines
of
dante
through
a
moselle
lunch
knows
what
a
weight
it
is
in
all
these
things
her
husband
was
useless
quite
useless
it
is
not
right
to
be
ashamed
of
one
husband
and
to
do
her
justice
always
explained
to
her
three
hundred
intimates
that
she
was
ashamed
of
him
in
fact
that
she
to
be
but
it
was
hard
to
see
him
brought
into
comparison
at
their
own
table
with
superior
men
put
him
for
instance
beside
sikleigh
snoop
the
and
where
was
he
nowhere
he
could
even
understand
what
snoop
was
saying
and
when
snoop
would
stand
on
the
with
a
cup
of
tea
balanced
in
his
hand
and
discuss
whether
sex
was
or
was
not
the
dominant
note
in
botticelli
would
be
skulking
in
a
corner
in
his
dress
suit
his
wife
would
often
catch
with
an
agonized
ear
such
scraps
of
talk
as
when
i
was
first
in
the
coal
and
wood
business
or
it
a
coal
that
burns
quicker
than
egg
but
it
has
the
heating
power
of
nut
or
even
in
a
low
undertone
the
words
if
you
feeling
while
he
reading
and
this
at
a
time
when
everybody
in
the
room
ought
to
have
been
listening
to
snoop
nor
was
even
this
the
whole
burden
of
there
was
another
part
of
it
which
was
perhaps
more
though
herself
never
put
it
into
words
in
fact
of
this
part
of
her
burden
she
never
spoke
even
to
her
bosom
friend
miss
snagg
nor
did
she
talk
about
it
to
the
ladies
of
the
dante
club
nor
did
she
make
speeches
on
it
to
the
members
of
the
women
afternoon
art
society
nor
to
the
monday
bridge
club
but
the
members
of
the
bridge
club
and
the
art
society
and
the
dante
club
all
talked
about
it
among
themselves
stated
very
simply
it
was
this
drank
it
was
not
meant
that
he
was
a
drunkard
or
that
he
drank
too
much
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
drank
that
was
all
there
was
no
excess
about
it
of
course
began
the
day
with
an
and
after
all
what
alert
man
does
not
wish
his
eyes
well
open
in
the
morning
he
followed
it
usually
just
before
breakfast
with
a
bracer
and
what
wiser
precaution
can
a
businessman
take
than
to
brace
his
breakfast
on
his
way
to
business
he
generally
had
his
motor
stopped
at
the
grand
palaver
for
a
moment
if
it
was
a
raw
day
and
dropped
in
and
took
something
to
keep
out
the
damp
if
it
was
a
cold
day
he
took
something
to
keep
out
the
cold
and
if
it
was
one
of
those
clear
sunny
days
that
are
so
dangerous
to
the
system
he
took
whatever
the
bartender
a
recognized
health
expert
suggested
to
tone
the
system
up
after
which
he
could
sit
down
in
his
office
and
transact
more
business
and
bigger
business
in
coal
charcoal
wood
pulp
pulpwood
and
woodpulp
in
two
hours
than
any
other
man
in
the
business
could
in
a
week
naturally
so
for
he
was
braced
and
propped
and
toned
up
and
his
eyes
had
been
opened
and
his
brain
cleared
till
outside
of
very
big
business
indeed
few
men
were
on
a
footing
with
him
in
fact
it
was
business
itself
which
had
compelled
to
drink
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
junior
clerk
on
twenty
dollars
a
week
to
do
his
work
on
sandwiches
and
malted
milk
in
big
business
it
is
not
possible
when
a
man
begins
to
rise
in
business
as
had
begun
years
ago
he
finds
that
if
he
wants
to
succeed
he
must
cut
malted
milk
clear
out
in
any
position
of
responsibility
a
man
has
got
to
drink
no
really
big
deal
can
be
put
through
without
it
if
two
keen
men
sharp
as
flint
get
together
to
make
a
deal
in
which
each
intends
to
outdo
the
other
the
only
way
to
succeed
is
for
them
to
adjourn
to
some
such
place
as
the
of
the
mausoleum
club
and
both
get
partially
drunk
this
is
what
is
called
the
personal
element
in
business
and
beside
it
plodding
industry
is
nowhere
most
of
all
do
these
principles
hold
true
in
such
manly
enterprises
as
the
forest
and
timber
business
where
one
deals
constantly
with
chief
rangers
and
pathfinders
and
whose
very
names
seem
to
suggest
a
horn
of
whiskey
under
a
hemlock
tree
but
let
it
be
repeated
and
carefully
understood
there
was
no
excess
about
drinking
indeed
whatever
he
might
be
compelled
to
take
during
the
day
and
at
the
mausoleum
club
in
the
evening
after
his
return
from
his
club
at
night
made
it
a
fixed
rule
to
take
nothing
he
might
perhaps
as
he
passed
into
the
house
step
into
the
and
take
a
very
small
drink
at
the
sideboard
but
this
he
counted
as
part
of
the
return
itself
and
not
after
it
and
he
might
if
his
brain
were
drop
down
later
in
the
night
in
his
pajamas
and
when
the
house
was
quiet
and
compose
his
mind
with
a
brandy
and
water
or
something
suitable
to
the
stillness
of
the
hour
but
this
was
not
really
a
drink
called
it
a
and
of
course
any
man
may
need
a
at
a
time
when
he
would
scorn
a
drink
but
after
all
a
woman
may
find
herself
again
in
her
daughter
there
at
least
is
consolation
for
as
herself
admitted
her
daughter
dulphemia
was
herself
again
there
were
of
course
differences
certain
differences
of
face
and
appearance
snoop
had
expressed
this
fact
exquisitely
when
he
said
that
it
was
the
difference
between
a
and
a
dante
gabriel
rossetti
but
even
at
that
the
mother
and
daughter
were
so
alike
that
people
certain
people
were
constantly
mistaking
them
on
the
street
and
as
everybody
that
mistook
them
was
apt
to
be
asked
to
dine
on
champagne
there
was
plenty
of
temptation
towards
error
there
is
no
doubt
that
dulphemia
was
a
girl
of
remarkable
character
and
intellect
so
is
any
girl
who
has
beautiful
golden
hair
parted
in
thick
bands
on
her
forehead
and
deep
blue
eyes
soft
as
an
italian
sky
even
the
oldest
and
most
serious
men
in
town
admitted
that
in
talking
to
her
they
were
aware
of
a
grasp
a
reach
a
depth
that
surprised
them
thus
old
judge
longerstill
who
talked
to
her
at
dinner
for
an
hour
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
felt
sure
from
the
way
in
which
she
looked
up
in
his
face
at
intervals
and
said
how
interesting
that
she
had
the
mind
of
a
lawyer
and
brace
the
consulting
engineer
who
showed
her
on
the
at
dessert
with
three
forks
and
a
spoon
the
method
in
which
the
overflow
of
the
spillway
of
the
gatun
dam
is
regulated
felt
assured
from
the
way
she
leaned
her
face
on
her
hand
sideways
and
said
how
extraordinary
that
she
had
the
brain
of
an
engineer
similarly
foreign
visitors
to
the
social
circles
of
the
city
were
delighted
with
her
viscount
fitzthistle
who
explained
to
dulphemia
for
half
an
hour
the
intricacies
of
the
irish
situation
was
captivated
at
the
quick
grasp
she
showed
by
asking
him
at
the
end
without
a
hesitation
and
which
are
the
nationalists
this
kind
of
thing
represents
female
intellect
in
its
best
form
every
man
that
is
really
a
man
is
willing
to
recognize
it
at
once
as
to
the
young
men
of
course
they
flocked
to
the
residence
in
shoals
there
were
batches
of
them
every
sunday
afternoon
at
five
encased
in
long
black
sitting
very
rigidly
in
upright
chairs
trying
to
drink
tea
with
one
hand
one
might
see
athletic
young
college
men
of
the
football
team
trying
hard
to
talk
about
italian
music
and
italian
tenors
from
the
grand
opera
doing
their
best
to
talk
about
college
football
there
were
young
men
in
business
talking
about
art
and
young
men
in
art
talking
about
religion
and
young
clergymen
talking
about
business
because
of
course
the
residence
was
the
kind
of
cultivated
home
where
people
of
education
and
taste
are
at
liberty
to
talk
about
things
they
do
know
and
to
utter
freely
ideas
that
they
have
got
it
was
only
now
and
again
when
one
of
the
professors
from
the
college
across
the
avenue
came
booming
into
the
room
that
the
whole
conversation
was
pulverized
into
dust
under
the
hammer
of
accurate
knowledge
the
whole
process
was
what
was
called
by
those
who
understood
such
things
a
many
people
said
that
afternoons
at
home
were
exactly
like
the
delightful
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
whether
the
gatherings
were
or
were
not
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
whose
care
certain
favoured
guests
dropped
quietly
into
the
back
alcove
of
the
did
his
best
to
put
the
gathering
on
a
par
with
the
best
saloons
of
the
twentieth
now
it
so
happened
that
there
had
come
a
singularly
slack
moment
in
the
social
life
of
the
city
the
grand
opera
had
sung
itself
into
a
huge
deficit
and
closed
there
remained
nothing
of
it
except
the
efforts
of
a
committee
of
ladies
to
raise
enough
money
to
enable
signor
puffi
to
leave
town
and
the
generous
attempt
of
another
committee
to
gather
funds
in
order
to
keep
signor
pasti
in
the
city
beyond
this
opera
was
dead
though
the
fact
that
the
deficit
was
nearly
twice
as
large
as
it
had
been
the
year
before
showed
that
public
interest
in
music
was
increasing
it
was
indeed
a
singularly
trying
time
of
the
year
it
was
too
early
to
go
to
europe
and
too
late
to
go
to
bermuda
it
was
too
warm
to
go
south
and
yet
still
too
cold
to
go
north
in
fact
one
was
almost
compelled
to
stay
at
home
which
was
dreadful
as
a
result
and
her
three
hundred
friends
moved
backwards
and
forwards
on
plutoria
avenue
seeking
novelty
in
vain
they
washed
in
waves
of
silk
from
tango
teas
to
bridge
afternoons
they
poured
in
liquid
avalanches
of
colour
into
crowded
receptions
and
they
sat
in
glittering
rows
and
listened
to
lectures
on
the
enfranchisement
of
the
female
sex
but
for
the
moment
all
was
weariness
now
it
happened
whether
by
accident
or
design
that
just
at
this
moment
of
general
and
her
three
hundred
friends
first
heard
of
the
presence
in
the
city
of
the
celebrated
oriental
mystic
he
was
so
celebrated
that
nobody
even
thought
of
asking
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
they
merely
told
one
another
and
repeated
it
that
he
was
celebrated
they
added
for
those
who
needed
the
knowledge
that
the
name
was
pronounced
and
that
the
doctrine
taught
by
was
boohooism
this
latter
if
anyone
inquired
further
was
explained
to
be
a
form
of
shoodooism
only
rather
more
intense
in
fact
it
was
esoteric
on
receipt
of
which
information
everybody
remarked
at
once
how
infinitely
superior
the
oriental
peoples
are
to
ourselves
now
as
was
always
a
leader
in
everything
that
was
done
in
the
best
circles
on
plutoria
avenue
she
was
naturally
among
the
first
to
visit
my
dear
she
said
in
describing
afterwards
her
experience
to
her
bosom
friend
miss
snagg
it
was
interesting
we
drove
away
down
to
the
queerest
part
of
the
city
and
went
to
the
strangest
little
house
imaginable
up
the
narrowest
stairs
one
ever
saw
quite
eastern
in
fact
just
like
a
scene
out
of
the
koran
how
fascinating
said
miss
snagg
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
house
had
been
inhabited
as
it
might
have
been
by
a
streetcar
conductor
or
a
railway
brakesman
would
have
thought
it
in
any
way
peculiar
or
fascinating
it
was
all
hung
with
curtains
inside
she
went
on
with
figures
of
snakes
and
indian
gods
perfectly
weird
and
did
you
see
mr
asked
miss
snagg
oh
no
my
dear
i
only
saw
his
assistant
ram
spudd
such
a
queer
little
round
man
a
bengalee
i
believe
he
put
his
back
against
a
curtain
and
spread
out
his
arms
sideways
and
would
let
me
pass
he
said
that
was
in
meditation
and
must
be
disturbed
how
delightful
echoed
miss
snagg
but
in
reality
was
sitting
behind
the
curtain
eating
a
can
of
pork
and
beans
what
i
like
most
about
eastern
people
went
on
is
their
wonderful
delicacy
of
feeling
after
i
had
explained
about
my
invitation
to
to
come
and
speak
to
us
on
boohooism
and
was
going
away
i
took
a
dollar
bill
out
of
my
purse
and
laid
it
on
the
table
you
should
have
seen
the
way
ram
spudd
took
it
he
made
the
deepest
salaam
and
said
guard
you
beautiful
lady
such
perfect
courtesy
and
yet
with
the
air
of
scorning
the
money
as
i
passed
out
i
could
help
slipping
another
dollar
into
his
hand
and
he
took
it
as
if
utterly
unaware
of
it
and
muttered
keep
you
o
flower
of
women
and
as
i
got
into
the
motor
i
gave
him
another
dollar
and
he
said
and
osiris
both
prolong
your
existence
o
lily
of
the
ricefield
and
after
he
had
said
it
he
stood
beside
the
door
of
the
motor
and
waited
without
moving
till
i
left
he
had
such
a
strange
rapt
look
as
if
he
were
still
expecting
something
how
exquisite
murmured
miss
snagg
it
was
her
business
in
life
to
murmur
such
things
as
this
for
on
the
whole
reckoning
grand
opera
tickets
and
dinners
she
did
very
well
out
of
it
is
it
not
said
so
different
from
our
men
i
felt
so
ashamed
of
my
chauffeur
our
new
man
you
know
he
seemed
such
a
contrast
beside
ram
spudd
the
rude
way
in
which
the
opened
the
door
and
the
rude
way
in
which
he
climbed
on
to
his
own
seat
and
the
with
which
he
turned
on
the
power
i
felt
positively
ashamed
and
he
so
managed
it
i
am
sure
he
did
it
on
purpose
that
the
car
splashed
a
lot
of
mud
over
spudd
as
it
started
yet
oddly
enough
the
opinion
of
other
people
on
this
new
chauffeur
that
of
miss
dulphemia
herself
for
example
to
whose
service
he
was
specially
attached
was
very
different
the
great
recommendation
of
him
in
the
eyes
of
miss
dulphemia
and
her
friends
and
the
thing
that
gave
him
a
touch
of
mystery
was
and
what
higher
qualification
can
a
chauffeur
want
that
he
did
look
like
a
chauffeur
at
all
my
dear
dulphie
whispered
miss
philippa
furlong
the
rector
sister
who
was
at
that
moment
dulphemia
second
self
as
they
sat
behind
the
new
chauffeur
do
tell
me
that
he
is
a
chauffeur
because
he
he
can
chauffe
of
course
but
that
nothing
for
the
new
chauffeur
had
a
bronzed
face
hard
as
metal
and
a
stern
eye
and
when
he
put
on
a
chauffeur
overcoat
some
how
it
seemed
to
turn
into
a
military
greatcoat
and
even
when
he
put
on
the
round
cloth
cap
of
his
profession
it
was
converted
straightway
into
a
military
shako
and
by
miss
dulphemia
and
her
friends
it
was
presently
reported
or
was
invented
that
he
had
served
in
the
philippines
which
explained
at
once
the
scar
upon
his
forehead
which
must
have
been
received
at
iloilo
or
or
some
other
suitable
place
but
what
affected
miss
dulphemia
brown
herself
was
the
splendid
rudeness
of
the
chauffeur
manner
it
was
so
different
from
that
of
the
young
men
of
the
thus
when
sikleigh
snoop
handed
her
into
the
car
at
any
time
he
would
dance
about
saying
allow
me
and
permit
me
and
would
dive
forward
to
arrange
the
robes
but
the
philippine
chauffeur
merely
swung
the
door
open
and
said
to
dulphemia
get
in
and
then
slammed
it
this
of
course
sent
a
thrill
up
the
spine
and
through
the
imagination
of
miss
dulphemia
because
it
showed
that
the
chauffeur
was
a
gentleman
in
disguise
she
thought
it
very
probable
that
he
was
a
british
nobleman
a
younger
son
very
wild
of
a
ducal
family
and
she
had
her
own
theories
as
to
why
he
had
entered
the
service
of
the
to
be
quite
candid
about
it
she
expected
that
the
philippine
chauffeur
meant
to
elope
with
her
and
every
time
he
drove
her
from
a
dinner
or
a
dance
she
sat
back
luxuriously
wishing
and
expecting
the
elopement
to
begin
but
for
the
time
being
the
interest
of
dulphemia
as
of
everybody
else
that
was
anybody
at
all
centred
round
and
the
new
cult
of
boohooism
after
the
visit
of
a
great
number
of
ladies
also
in
motors
drove
down
to
the
house
of
and
all
of
them
whether
they
saw
himself
or
his
bengalee
assistant
ram
spudd
came
back
delighted
such
exquisite
tact
said
one
such
delicacy
as
i
was
about
to
go
i
laid
a
five
dollar
gold
piece
on
the
edge
of
the
little
table
spudd
scarcely
seemed
to
see
it
he
murmured
help
you
and
pointed
to
the
ceiling
i
raised
my
eyes
instinctively
and
when
i
lowered
them
the
money
had
disappeared
i
think
he
must
have
caused
it
to
vanish
oh
i
sure
he
did
said
the
listener
others
came
back
with
wonderful
stories
of
occult
powers
especially
his
marvellous
gift
of
reading
the
future
buncomhearst
who
had
just
lost
her
third
husband
by
divorce
had
received
from
a
glimpse
into
the
future
that
was
almost
uncanny
in
its
exactness
she
had
asked
for
a
divination
and
had
effected
one
by
causing
her
to
lay
six
pieces
on
the
table
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
mystic
serpent
over
these
he
had
bent
and
peered
deeply
as
if
seeking
to
unravel
their
meaning
and
finally
he
had
given
her
the
prophecy
many
things
are
yet
to
happen
before
others
begin
how
he
do
it
asked
everybody
as
a
result
of
all
this
it
naturally
came
about
that
and
ram
spudd
were
invited
to
appear
at
the
residence
of
and
it
was
understood
that
steps
would
be
taken
to
form
a
special
society
to
be
known
as
the
oriental
society
sikleigh
snoop
the
was
the
leading
spirit
in
the
organization
he
had
a
special
fitness
for
the
task
he
had
actually
resided
in
india
in
fact
he
had
spent
six
weeks
there
on
a
ticket
of
a
dollar
steamship
pilgrimage
and
he
knew
the
whole
country
from
jehumbapore
in
bhootal
to
jehumbalabad
in
the
carnatic
so
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
great
authority
on
india
china
mongolia
and
all
such
places
by
the
ladies
of
plutoria
avenue
next
in
importance
was
buncomhearst
who
became
later
by
a
perfectly
natural
process
the
president
of
the
society
she
was
already
president
of
the
daughters
of
the
revolution
a
society
confined
exclusively
to
the
descendants
of
washington
officers
and
others
she
was
also
president
of
the
sisters
of
england
an
organization
limited
exclusively
to
women
born
in
england
and
elsewhere
of
the
daughters
of
kossuth
made
up
solely
of
hungarians
and
friends
of
hungary
and
other
nations
and
of
the
circle
of
franz
joseph
which
was
composed
exclusively
of
the
partisans
and
others
of
austria
in
fact
ever
since
she
had
lost
her
third
husband
buncomhearst
had
thrown
herself
that
was
her
phrase
into
outside
activities
her
one
wish
was
on
her
own
statement
to
lose
herself
so
very
naturally
looked
at
once
to
buncomhearst
to
preside
over
the
meetings
of
the
new
society
the
large
at
the
had
been
cleared
out
as
a
sort
of
auditorium
and
in
it
some
fifty
or
sixty
of
more
intimate
friends
had
gathered
the
whole
meeting
was
composed
of
ladies
except
for
the
presence
of
one
or
two
men
who
represented
special
cases
there
was
of
course
little
spillikins
with
his
vacuous
face
and
football
hair
who
was
there
as
everybody
knew
on
account
of
dulphemia
and
there
was
old
judge
longerstill
who
sat
leaning
on
a
stick
with
his
head
sideways
trying
to
hear
some
fraction
of
what
was
being
said
he
came
to
the
gathering
in
the
hope
that
it
would
prove
a
likely
place
for
seconding
a
vote
of
thanks
and
saying
a
few
words
half
an
hour
talk
perhaps
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
failing
that
he
felt
sure
that
at
least
someone
would
call
him
this
eminent
old
gentleman
and
even
that
was
better
than
staying
at
home
but
for
the
most
part
the
audience
was
composed
of
women
and
they
sat
in
a
little
buzz
of
conversation
waiting
for
i
wonder
called
buncomhearst
from
the
chair
if
some
lady
would
be
good
enough
to
write
minutes
miss
snagg
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
write
minutes
could
you
i
shall
be
delighted
said
miss
snagg
but
i
afraid
there
hardly
time
to
write
them
before
we
begin
is
there
oh
but
it
would
be
all
right
to
write
them
chorussed
several
ladies
who
understood
such
things
it
quite
often
done
that
way
and
i
should
like
to
move
that
we
vote
a
constitution
said
a
stout
lady
with
a
double
is
that
carried
said
buncomhearst
all
those
in
favour
please
signify
nobody
stirred
carried
said
the
president
and
perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
fyshe
she
said
turning
towards
the
stout
lady
to
the
constitution
do
you
think
it
necessary
to
it
said
fyshe
i
should
like
to
move
if
i
may
that
i
almost
wonder
whether
it
is
necessary
to
write
the
constitution
unless
of
course
anybody
thinks
that
we
really
ought
to
ladies
said
the
president
you
have
heard
the
motion
all
those
against
it
there
was
no
sign
all
those
in
favour
of
it
there
was
still
no
sign
lost
she
said
then
looking
across
at
the
clock
on
the
and
realizing
that
must
have
been
delayed
and
that
something
must
be
done
she
said
and
now
ladies
as
we
have
in
our
midst
a
most
eminent
gentleman
who
probably
has
thought
more
deeply
about
constitutions
than
all
eyes
turned
at
once
towards
judge
longerstill
but
as
fortune
had
it
at
this
very
moment
sikleigh
snoop
entered
followed
by
and
ram
spudd
was
tall
his
drooping
oriental
costume
made
him
taller
still
he
had
a
long
brown
face
and
liquid
brown
eyes
of
such
depth
that
when
he
turned
them
full
upon
the
ladies
before
him
a
shiver
of
interest
and
apprehension
followed
in
the
track
of
his
glance
my
dear
said
miss
snagg
afterwards
he
seemed
simply
to
see
right
through
us
this
was
correct
he
did
ram
spudd
presented
a
contrast
to
his
superior
he
was
short
and
round
with
a
dimpled
mahogany
face
and
eyes
that
twinkled
in
it
like
little
puddles
of
molasses
his
head
was
bound
in
a
turban
and
his
body
was
swathed
in
so
many
bands
and
sashes
that
he
looked
almost
circular
the
clothes
of
both
and
ram
spudd
were
covered
with
the
mystic
signs
of
buddha
and
the
seven
serpents
of
vishnu
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
or
ram
spudd
to
address
the
audience
their
knowledge
of
english
was
known
to
be
too
slight
for
that
their
communications
were
expressed
entirely
through
the
medium
of
snoop
and
even
he
explained
afterwards
that
it
was
very
difficult
the
only
languages
of
india
which
he
was
able
to
speak
he
said
with
any
fluency
were
gargamic
and
gumaic
both
of
these
being
old
dravidian
dialects
with
only
two
hundred
and
three
words
in
each
and
hence
in
themselves
very
difficult
to
converse
in
answered
in
what
snoop
understood
to
be
the
iramic
of
the
vedas
a
very
rich
language
but
one
which
unfortunately
he
did
not
understand
the
dilemma
is
one
familiar
to
all
oriental
scholars
all
of
this
snoop
explained
in
the
opening
speech
which
he
proceeded
to
make
and
after
this
he
went
on
to
disclose
amid
deep
interest
the
general
nature
of
the
cult
of
boohooism
he
said
that
they
could
best
understand
it
if
he
told
them
that
its
central
doctrine
was
that
of
bahee
indeed
the
first
aim
of
all
followers
of
the
cult
was
to
attain
to
bahee
anybody
who
could
spend
a
certain
number
of
hours
each
day
say
sixteen
in
silent
meditation
on
boohooism
would
find
his
mind
gradually
reaching
a
condition
of
bahee
the
chief
aim
of
bahee
itself
was
sacrifice
a
true
follower
of
the
cult
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
his
friends
or
his
relatives
and
even
strangers
in
order
to
reach
bahee
in
this
way
one
was
able
fully
to
realize
oneself
and
enter
into
the
higher
indifference
beyond
this
further
meditation
and
fasting
by
which
was
meant
living
solely
on
fish
fruit
wine
and
meat
one
presently
attained
to
complete
swaraj
or
control
of
self
and
might
in
time
pass
into
the
absolute
nirvana
or
the
negation
of
emptiness
the
supreme
goal
of
boohooism
as
a
first
step
to
all
this
snoop
explained
each
neophyte
or
candidate
for
holiness
must
after
searching
his
own
heart
send
ten
dollars
to
gold
it
appeared
was
recognized
in
the
cult
of
boohooism
as
typifying
the
three
chief
virtues
whereas
silver
or
paper
money
did
not
even
national
banknotes
were
only
regarded
as
do
or
a
halfway
palliation
and
outside
currencies
such
as
canadian
or
mexican
bills
were
looked
upon
as
entirely
boo
or
contemptible
the
oriental
view
of
money
said
snoop
was
far
superior
to
our
own
but
it
also
might
be
attained
by
deep
thought
and
as
a
beginning
by
sending
ten
dollars
to
after
this
snoop
in
conclusion
read
a
very
beautiful
hindu
poem
translating
it
as
he
went
along
it
began
o
cow
standing
beside
the
ganges
and
apparently
without
visible
occupation
and
it
was
voted
exquisite
by
all
who
heard
it
the
absence
of
rhyme
and
the
entire
removal
of
ideas
marked
it
as
far
beyond
anything
reached
as
yet
by
occidental
culture
when
snoop
had
concluded
the
president
called
upon
judge
longerstill
for
a
few
words
of
thanks
which
he
gave
followed
by
a
brief
talk
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
after
this
the
society
was
declared
constituted
made
four
salaams
one
to
each
point
of
the
compass
and
the
meeting
dispersed
and
that
evening
over
fifty
dinner
tables
everybody
discussed
the
nature
of
bahee
and
tried
in
vain
to
explain
it
to
men
too
stupid
to
understand
now
it
so
happened
that
on
the
very
afternoon
of
this
meeting
at
the
philippine
chauffeur
did
a
strange
and
peculiar
thing
he
first
asked
for
a
few
hours
leave
of
absence
to
attend
the
funeral
of
his
mother
this
was
a
request
which
on
principle
never
refused
to
a
whereupon
the
philippine
chauffeur
no
longer
attired
as
one
visited
the
residence
of
he
let
himself
in
with
a
marvellous
little
key
which
he
produced
from
a
very
wonderful
bunch
of
such
he
was
in
the
house
for
nearly
half
an
hour
and
when
he
emerged
the
notebook
in
his
breast
pocket
had
there
been
an
eye
to
read
it
would
have
been
seen
to
be
filled
with
stranger
details
in
regard
to
oriental
mysticism
than
even
had
given
to
the
world
so
strange
were
they
that
before
the
philippine
chauffeur
returned
to
the
residence
he
telegraphed
certain
and
sundry
parts
of
them
to
new
york
but
why
he
should
have
addressed
them
to
the
head
of
a
detective
bureau
instead
of
to
a
college
of
oriental
research
it
passes
the
imagination
to
conceive
but
as
the
chauffeur
duly
reappeared
at
in
the
evening
the
incident
passed
unnoticed
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
narrative
to
trace
the
progress
of
boohooism
during
the
splendid
but
brief
career
of
the
oriental
society
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
its
success
its
principles
appealed
with
great
strength
to
all
the
more
cultivated
among
the
ladies
of
plutoria
avenue
there
was
something
in
the
oriental
mysticism
of
its
doctrines
which
rendered
previous
belief
stale
and
puerile
the
practice
of
the
sacred
rites
began
at
once
the
ladies
counters
of
the
plutorian
banks
were
inundated
with
requests
for
pieces
in
exchange
for
banknotes
at
dinner
in
the
best
houses
nothing
was
eaten
except
a
thin
soup
or
bru
followed
by
fish
succeeded
by
meat
or
by
game
especially
such
birds
as
are
particularly
pleasing
to
buddha
as
the
partridge
the
pheasant
and
the
woodcock
after
this
except
for
fruits
and
wine
the
principle
of
swaraj
or
denial
of
self
was
rigidly
imposed
special
oriental
dinners
of
this
sort
were
given
followed
by
listening
to
the
reading
of
oriental
poetry
with
closed
eyes
and
with
the
mind
as
far
as
possible
in
a
state
of
stoj
or
negation
of
thought
by
this
means
the
general
doctrine
of
boohooism
spread
rapidly
indeed
a
great
many
of
the
members
of
the
society
soon
attained
to
a
stage
of
bahee
or
the
higher
indifference
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
equal
outside
of
juggapore
or
jumbumbabad
for
example
when
buncomhearst
learned
of
the
remarriage
of
her
second
husband
she
had
lost
him
three
years
before
owing
to
a
difference
of
opinion
on
the
emancipation
of
women
she
showed
the
most
complete
bahee
possible
and
when
miss
snagg
learned
that
her
brother
in
venezuela
had
died
a
very
sudden
death
brought
on
by
drinking
rum
for
seventeen
years
and
had
left
her
ten
thousand
dollars
the
bahee
which
she
exhibited
almost
amounted
to
nirvana
in
fact
the
very
general
dissemination
of
the
oriental
idea
became
more
and
more
noticeable
with
each
week
that
passed
some
members
attained
to
so
complete
a
bahee
or
higher
indifference
that
they
even
ceased
to
attend
the
meetings
of
the
society
others
reached
a
swaraj
or
control
of
self
so
great
that
they
no
longer
read
its
pamphlets
while
others
again
actually
passed
into
nirvana
to
a
complete
negation
of
self
so
rapidly
that
they
did
not
even
pay
their
subscriptions
but
features
of
this
sort
of
course
are
familiar
wherever
a
successful
occult
creed
makes
its
way
against
the
prejudices
of
the
multitude
the
really
notable
part
of
the
whole
experience
was
the
marvellous
demonstration
of
occult
power
which
attended
the
final
seance
of
the
society
the
true
nature
of
which
is
still
wrapped
in
mystery
for
some
weeks
it
had
been
rumoured
that
a
very
special
feat
or
demonstration
of
power
by
was
under
contemplation
in
fact
the
rapid
spread
of
swaraj
and
of
nirvana
among
the
members
rendered
such
a
feat
highly
desirable
just
what
form
the
demonstration
would
take
was
for
some
time
a
matter
of
doubt
it
was
whispered
at
first
that
would
attempt
the
mysterious
eastern
rite
of
burying
ram
spudd
alive
in
the
garden
of
the
residence
and
leaving
him
there
in
a
state
of
stoj
or
suspended
inanition
for
eight
days
but
this
project
was
abandoned
owing
to
some
doubt
apparently
in
the
mind
of
ram
spudd
as
to
his
astral
fitness
for
the
high
state
of
stoj
necessitated
by
the
experiment
at
last
it
became
known
to
the
members
of
the
poosh
or
inner
circle
under
the
seal
of
confidence
that
would
attempt
nothing
less
than
the
supreme
feat
of
occultism
namely
a
reincarnation
or
more
correctly
a
reastralization
of
buddha
the
members
of
the
inner
circle
shivered
with
a
luxurious
sense
of
mystery
when
they
heard
of
it
has
it
ever
been
done
before
they
asked
of
snoop
only
a
few
times
he
said
once
i
believe
by
the
famous
yogi
of
the
carnatic
once
perhaps
twice
by
boohoo
the
founder
of
the
sect
but
it
is
looked
upon
as
extremely
rare
yahi
tells
me
that
the
great
danger
is
that
if
the
slightest
part
of
the
formula
is
incorrectly
observed
the
person
attempting
the
astralization
is
swallowed
up
into
nothingness
however
he
declares
himself
willing
to
try
the
seance
was
to
take
place
at
residence
and
was
to
be
at
midnight
at
midnight
said
each
member
in
surprise
and
the
answer
was
yes
at
midnight
you
see
midnight
here
is
exactly
midday
in
allahabad
in
india
this
explanation
was
of
course
ample
midnight
repeated
everybody
to
everybody
else
is
exactly
midday
in
allahabad
that
made
things
perfectly
clear
whereas
if
midnight
had
been
midday
in
timbuctoo
the
whole
situation
would
have
been
different
each
of
the
ladies
was
requested
to
bring
to
the
seance
some
ornament
of
gold
but
it
must
be
plain
gold
without
any
setting
of
stones
it
was
known
already
that
according
to
the
cult
of
boohooism
gold
plain
gold
is
the
seat
of
the
three
virtues
beauty
wisdom
and
grace
therefore
according
to
the
creed
of
boohooism
anyone
who
has
enough
gold
plain
gold
is
endowed
with
these
virtues
and
is
all
right
all
that
is
needed
is
to
have
enough
of
it
the
virtues
follow
as
a
consequence
but
for
the
great
experiment
the
gold
used
must
not
be
set
with
stones
with
the
one
exception
of
rubies
which
are
known
to
be
endowed
with
the
three
attributes
of
hindu
worship
modesty
loquacity
and
pomposity
in
the
present
case
it
was
found
that
as
a
number
of
ladies
had
nothing
but
gold
ornaments
set
with
diamonds
a
second
exception
was
made
especially
as
on
appeal
decided
that
diamonds
though
less
pleasing
to
buddha
than
rubies
possessed
the
secondary
hindu
virtues
of
divisibility
movability
and
disposability
on
the
evening
in
question
the
residence
of
might
have
been
observed
at
midnight
wrapped
in
utter
darkness
no
lights
were
shown
a
single
taper
brought
by
ram
spudd
from
the
taj
mohal
and
resembling
in
its
outer
texture
those
sold
at
the
store
near
spudd
residence
burned
on
a
small
table
in
the
vast
the
servants
had
been
sent
upstairs
and
expressly
enjoined
to
retire
at
half
past
ten
moreover
had
had
to
attend
that
evening
at
the
mausoleum
club
a
meeting
of
the
trustees
of
the
church
of
asaph
and
he
had
come
home
at
eleven
as
he
always
did
after
diocesan
work
of
this
sort
quite
used
up
in
fact
so
fatigued
that
he
had
gone
upstairs
to
his
own
suite
of
rooms
sideways
his
knees
bending
under
him
so
utterly
used
up
was
he
with
his
church
work
that
as
far
as
any
interest
in
what
might
be
going
on
in
his
own
residence
he
had
attained
to
a
state
of
bahee
or
higher
indifference
that
even
buddha
might
have
envied
the
guests
as
had
been
arranged
arrived
noiselessly
and
on
foot
all
motors
were
left
at
least
a
block
away
they
made
their
way
up
the
steps
of
the
darkened
house
and
were
admitted
without
ringing
the
door
opening
silently
in
front
of
them
and
ram
spudd
who
had
arrived
on
foot
carrying
a
large
parcel
were
already
there
and
were
behind
a
screen
in
the
darkened
room
reported
to
be
in
meditation
at
a
whispered
word
from
snoop
who
did
duty
at
the
door
all
furs
and
wraps
were
discarded
in
the
hall
and
laid
in
a
pile
then
the
guests
passed
silently
into
the
great
dining
room
there
was
no
light
in
it
except
the
dim
taper
which
stood
on
a
little
table
on
this
table
each
guest
as
instructed
laid
an
ornament
of
gold
and
at
the
same
time
was
uttered
in
a
low
voice
the
word
ksvoo
this
means
o
buddha
i
herewith
lay
my
unworthy
offering
at
thy
feet
take
it
and
keep
it
for
ever
it
was
explained
that
this
was
only
a
form
what
is
he
doing
whispered
the
assembled
guests
as
they
saw
pass
across
the
darkened
room
and
stand
in
front
of
the
sideboard
hush
said
snoop
he
laying
the
propitiatory
offering
for
buddha
it
an
indian
rite
whispered
could
be
seen
dimly
moving
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
sideboard
there
was
a
faint
clinking
of
glass
he
has
to
set
out
a
glass
of
burmese
brandy
powdered
over
with
nutmeg
and
aromatics
whispered
i
had
the
greatest
hunt
to
get
it
all
for
him
he
said
that
nothing
but
burmese
brandy
would
do
because
in
the
hindu
religion
the
god
can
only
be
invoked
with
burmese
brandy
or
failing
that
hennessy
with
three
stars
which
is
not
entirely
displeasing
to
buddha
the
aromatics
whispered
snoop
are
supposed
to
waft
a
perfume
or
incense
to
reach
the
nostrils
of
the
god
the
glass
of
propitiatory
wine
and
the
aromatic
spices
are
mentioned
in
the
his
preparations
completed
was
now
seen
to
stand
in
front
of
the
sideboard
bowing
deeply
four
times
in
an
oriental
salaam
the
light
of
the
single
taper
had
by
this
time
burned
so
dim
that
his
movements
were
vague
and
uncertain
his
body
cast
great
flickering
shadows
on
the
wall
from
his
throat
there
issued
a
low
wail
in
which
the
word
wah
wah
could
be
distinguished
the
excitement
was
intense
what
does
wah
mean
whispered
spillikins
hush
said
snoop
it
means
buddha
wherever
thou
art
in
thy
lofty
nirvana
descend
yet
once
in
astral
form
before
our
eyes
rose
he
was
seen
to
place
one
finger
on
his
lips
and
then
silently
moving
across
the
room
he
disappeared
behind
the
screen
of
what
ram
spudd
was
doing
during
this
period
there
is
no
record
it
was
presumed
that
he
was
still
praying
the
stillness
was
now
absolute
we
must
wait
in
perfect
silence
whispered
snoop
from
the
extreme
tips
of
his
lips
everybody
sat
in
strained
intensity
silent
looking
towards
the
vague
outline
of
the
sideboard
the
minutes
passed
no
one
moved
all
were
spellbound
in
expectancy
still
the
minutes
passed
the
taper
had
flickered
down
till
the
great
room
was
almost
in
darkness
could
it
be
that
by
some
neglect
in
the
preparations
the
substitution
perhaps
of
the
wrong
brandy
the
astralization
could
not
be
effected
but
no
quite
suddenly
it
seemed
everybody
in
the
darkened
room
was
aware
of
a
that
was
the
word
as
afterwards
repeated
in
a
hundred
confidential
discussions
a
one
could
call
it
a
body
it
was
it
was
a
figure
an
astral
form
a
presence
buddha
they
gasped
as
they
looked
at
it
just
how
the
figure
entered
the
room
the
spectators
could
never
afterwards
agree
some
thought
it
appeared
through
the
wall
deliberately
astralizing
itself
as
it
passed
through
the
bricks
others
seemed
to
have
seen
it
pass
in
at
the
farther
door
of
the
room
as
if
it
had
astralized
itself
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
back
of
the
hall
outside
be
that
as
it
may
there
it
stood
before
them
the
astralized
shape
of
the
indian
deity
so
that
to
every
lip
there
rose
the
word
buddha
or
at
least
to
every
lip
except
that
of
from
her
there
came
no
sound
the
figure
as
afterwards
described
was
attired
in
a
long
such
as
is
worn
by
the
grand
llama
of
tibet
and
resembling
if
the
comparison
were
not
profane
a
modern
the
legs
if
one
might
so
call
them
of
the
apparition
were
enwrapped
in
loose
punjahamas
a
word
which
is
said
to
be
the
origin
of
the
modern
pyjamas
while
the
feet
if
they
were
feet
were
encased
in
loose
slippers
buddha
moved
slowly
across
the
room
arrived
at
the
sideboard
the
astral
figure
paused
and
even
in
the
uncertain
light
buddha
was
seen
to
raise
and
drink
the
propitiatory
offering
that
much
was
perfectly
clear
whether
buddha
spoke
or
not
is
doubtful
certain
of
the
spectators
thought
that
he
said
a
fagotnit
which
is
hindustanee
for
blessings
on
this
house
to
distracted
mind
it
seemed
as
if
buddha
said
i
must
have
forgotten
it
but
this
wild
fancy
she
never
breathed
to
a
soul
silently
buddha
recrossed
the
room
slowly
wiping
one
arm
across
his
mouth
after
the
hindu
gesture
of
farewell
for
perhaps
a
full
minute
after
the
disappearance
of
buddha
not
a
soul
moved
then
quite
suddenly
unable
to
stand
the
tension
any
longer
pressed
an
electric
switch
and
the
whole
room
was
flooded
with
light
there
sat
the
affrighted
guests
staring
at
one
another
with
pale
faces
but
to
the
amazement
and
horror
of
all
the
little
table
in
the
centre
stood
empty
not
a
single
gem
not
a
fraction
of
the
gold
that
had
lain
upon
it
was
left
all
had
disappeared
the
truth
seemed
to
burst
upon
everyone
at
once
there
was
no
doubt
of
what
had
happened
the
gold
and
the
jewels
had
been
deastralized
under
the
occult
power
of
the
vision
they
had
been
demonetized
engulfed
into
the
astral
plane
along
with
the
vanishing
buddha
filled
with
the
sense
of
horror
still
to
come
somebody
pulled
aside
the
little
screen
they
fully
expected
to
find
the
lifeless
bodies
of
and
the
faithful
ram
spudd
what
they
saw
before
them
was
more
dreadful
still
the
outer
oriental
garments
of
the
two
devotees
lay
strewn
upon
the
floor
the
long
sash
of
and
the
thick
turban
of
ram
spudd
were
side
by
side
near
them
almost
sickening
in
its
repulsive
realism
was
the
thick
black
head
of
hair
of
the
junior
devotee
apparently
torn
from
his
scalp
as
if
by
lightning
and
bearing
a
horrible
resemblance
to
the
wig
of
an
actor
the
truth
was
too
plain
they
are
engulfed
cried
a
dozen
voices
at
once
it
was
realized
in
a
flash
that
and
ram
spudd
had
paid
the
penalty
of
their
daring
with
their
lives
through
some
fatal
neglect
against
which
they
had
fairly
warned
the
participants
of
the
seance
the
two
orientals
had
been
carried
bodily
in
the
astral
plane
how
dreadful
murmured
snoop
we
must
have
made
some
awful
error
are
they
deastralized
murmured
buncomhearst
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
snoop
and
then
another
voice
in
the
group
was
heard
to
say
we
must
hush
it
up
we
have
it
known
on
which
a
chorus
of
voices
joined
in
everybody
urging
that
it
must
be
hushed
up
could
you
try
to
reastralize
them
said
somebody
to
snoop
no
no
said
snoop
still
shaking
better
not
try
to
we
must
hush
it
up
if
we
can
and
the
general
assent
to
this
sentiment
showed
that
after
all
the
principles
of
bahee
or
indifference
to
others
had
taken
a
real
root
in
the
society
hush
it
up
cried
everybody
and
there
was
a
general
move
towards
the
hall
good
heavens
exclaimed
buncomhearst
our
wraps
deastralized
said
the
guests
there
was
a
moment
of
further
consternation
as
everybody
gazed
at
the
spot
where
the
pile
of
furs
and
wraps
had
lain
never
mind
said
everybody
let
go
without
them
do
stay
just
think
if
the
police
should
and
at
the
word
police
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
heard
in
the
street
the
clanging
of
a
bell
and
the
racing
gallop
of
the
horses
of
the
police
patrol
wagon
the
police
cried
everybody
hush
it
up
hush
it
up
for
of
course
the
principles
of
bahee
are
not
known
to
the
police
in
another
moment
the
doorbell
of
the
house
rang
with
a
long
and
violent
peal
and
in
a
second
as
it
seemed
the
whole
hall
was
filled
with
bulky
figures
uniformed
in
blue
it
all
right
cried
a
loud
firm
voice
from
the
sidewalk
we
have
them
both
everything
is
here
we
got
them
before
they
gone
a
block
but
if
you
do
mind
the
police
must
get
a
couple
of
names
for
witnesses
in
the
warrant
it
was
the
philippine
chauffeur
but
he
was
no
longer
attired
as
such
he
wore
the
uniform
of
an
inspector
of
police
and
there
was
the
metal
badge
of
the
detective
department
now
ostentatiously
outside
his
coat
and
beside
him
one
on
each
side
of
him
there
stood
the
deastralized
forms
of
and
ram
spudd
they
wore
long
overcoats
doubtless
the
contents
of
the
magic
parcels
and
the
philippine
chauffeur
had
a
grip
of
iron
on
the
neck
of
each
as
they
stood
spudd
had
lost
his
oriental
hair
and
the
face
of
perhaps
in
the
struggle
which
had
taken
place
had
been
scraped
white
in
patches
they
were
making
no
attempt
to
break
away
indeed
spudd
with
that
complete
bahee
or
submission
to
fate
which
is
attained
only
by
long
services
in
state
penitentiaries
was
smiling
and
smoking
a
cigarette
we
were
waiting
for
them
explained
a
tall
police
officer
to
the
two
or
three
ladies
who
now
gathered
round
him
with
a
return
of
courage
they
had
the
stuff
in
a
and
were
pushing
it
away
the
chief
caught
them
at
the
corner
and
rang
the
patrol
from
there
you
find
everything
all
right
i
think
ladies
he
added
as
a
burly
assistant
was
seen
carrying
an
armload
of
furs
up
the
steps
somehow
many
of
the
ladies
realized
at
the
moment
what
cheery
safe
reliable
people
policemen
in
blue
are
and
what
a
friendly
familiar
shelter
they
offer
against
the
wiles
of
oriental
occultism
are
they
old
criminals
someone
asked
yes
they
worked
this
same
thing
in
four
cities
already
and
both
of
them
have
done
time
and
lots
of
it
they
only
been
out
six
months
no
need
to
worry
over
them
he
concluded
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
so
the
furs
were
restored
and
the
gold
and
the
jewels
parcelled
out
among
the
owners
and
in
due
course
and
ram
spudd
were
lifted
up
into
the
patrol
wagon
where
they
seated
themselves
with
a
composure
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
jehumbabah
and
bahoolapore
in
fact
spudd
was
heard
to
address
the
police
as
boys
and
to
remark
that
they
had
got
them
good
that
time
so
the
seance
ended
and
the
guests
vanished
and
the
society
terminated
itself
without
even
a
vote
of
dissolution
and
in
all
the
later
confidential
discussions
of
the
episode
only
one
point
of
mysticism
remained
after
they
had
time
really
to
reflect
on
it
free
from
all
danger
of
arrest
the
members
of
the
society
realized
that
on
one
point
the
police
were
entirely
off
the
truth
of
things
for
whether
a
thief
or
not
and
whether
he
came
from
the
orient
or
as
the
police
said
from
missouri
had
actually
succeeded
in
reastralizing
buddha
nor
was
anyone
more
emphatic
on
this
point
than
herself
for
after
all
she
said
if
it
was
not
buddha
who
was
it
and
the
question
was
never
answered
chapter
five
the
love
story
of
peter
spillikins
almost
any
day
on
plutoria
avenue
or
thereabouts
you
may
see
little
spillikins
out
walking
with
his
four
tall
sons
who
are
practically
as
old
as
himself
to
be
exact
spillikins
is
and
bob
the
oldest
of
the
boys
must
be
at
least
twenty
their
exact
ages
are
no
longer
known
because
by
a
dreadful
accident
their
mother
forgot
them
this
was
at
a
time
when
the
boys
were
all
at
wackem
academy
for
exceptional
youths
in
the
foothills
of
tennessee
and
while
their
mother
everleigh
was
spending
the
winter
on
the
riviera
and
felt
that
for
their
own
sake
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
have
the
boys
with
her
but
now
of
course
since
everleigh
has
remarried
and
become
there
is
no
need
to
keep
them
at
wackem
any
longer
spillikins
is
able
to
look
after
them
spillikins
generally
wears
a
little
top
hat
and
an
english
morning
coat
the
boys
are
in
eton
jackets
and
black
trousers
which
at
their
mother
wish
are
kept
just
a
little
too
short
for
them
this
is
because
feels
that
the
day
will
come
some
day
say
fifteen
years
hence
when
the
boys
will
no
longer
be
children
and
meantime
it
is
so
nice
to
feel
that
they
are
still
mere
boys
bob
is
the
eldest
but
sib
the
youngest
is
the
tallest
whereas
willie
the
third
boy
is
the
dullest
although
this
has
often
been
denied
by
those
who
claim
that
gib
the
second
boy
is
just
a
trifle
duller
thus
at
any
rate
there
is
a
certain
equality
and
good
fellowship
all
round
is
not
to
be
seen
walking
with
them
she
is
probably
at
the
being
taken
there
by
captain
cormorant
of
the
united
states
navy
which
spillikins
considers
very
handsome
of
him
every
now
and
then
the
captain
being
in
the
navy
is
compelled
to
be
at
sea
for
perhaps
a
whole
afternoon
or
even
several
days
in
which
case
is
very
generally
taken
to
the
hunt
club
or
the
country
club
by
lieutenant
hawk
which
spillikins
regards
as
awfully
thoughtful
of
him
or
if
lieutenant
hawk
is
also
out
of
town
for
the
day
as
he
sometimes
has
to
be
because
he
is
in
the
united
states
army
is
taken
out
by
old
colonel
shake
who
is
in
the
state
militia
and
who
is
at
leisure
all
the
time
during
their
walks
on
plutoria
avenue
one
may
hear
the
four
boys
addressing
spillikins
as
father
and
dad
in
deep
voices
say
dad
drawls
bob
could
we
all
go
to
the
ball
game
no
say
dad
says
gib
let
all
go
back
to
the
house
and
play
pool
in
the
all
right
boys
says
spillikins
and
a
few
minutes
later
one
may
see
them
all
hustling
up
the
steps
of
the
mansion
quite
eager
at
the
prospect
and
all
talking
together
now
the
whole
of
this
daily
panorama
to
the
eye
that
can
read
it
represents
the
outcome
of
the
tangled
love
story
of
spillikins
which
culminated
during
the
summer
houseparty
at
castel
casteggio
the
woodland
retreat
of
and
newberry
but
to
understand
the
story
one
must
turn
back
a
year
or
so
to
the
time
when
peter
spillikins
used
to
walk
on
plutoria
avenue
alone
or
sit
in
the
mausoleum
club
listening
to
the
advice
of
people
who
told
him
that
he
really
ought
to
get
married
in
those
days
the
first
thing
that
one
noticed
about
peter
spillikins
was
his
exalted
view
of
the
other
sex
every
time
he
passed
a
beautiful
woman
in
the
street
he
said
to
himself
i
say
even
when
he
met
a
moderately
beautiful
one
he
murmured
by
jove
when
an
easter
hat
went
sailing
past
or
a
group
of
summer
parasols
stood
talking
on
a
leafy
corner
spillikins
ejaculated
my
word
at
the
opera
and
at
tango
teas
his
projecting
blue
eyes
almost
popped
out
of
his
head
similarly
if
he
happened
to
be
with
one
of
his
friends
he
would
murmur
i
say
look
at
that
beautiful
girl
or
would
exclaim
i
say
do
look
but
is
that
an
awfully
pretty
girl
across
the
street
or
at
the
opera
old
man
do
let
her
see
you
looking
but
do
you
see
that
lovely
girl
in
the
box
opposite
one
must
add
to
this
that
spillikins
in
spite
of
his
large
and
bulging
blue
eyes
enjoyed
the
heavenly
gift
of
short
sight
as
a
consequence
he
lived
in
a
world
of
amazingly
beautiful
women
and
as
his
mind
was
focused
in
the
same
way
as
his
eyes
he
endowed
them
with
all
the
virtues
and
graces
which
ought
to
adhere
to
flowered
hats
and
cerise
parasols
with
ivory
handles
nor
to
do
him
justice
did
spillikins
confine
his
attitude
to
his
view
of
women
alone
he
brought
it
to
bear
on
everything
every
time
he
went
to
the
opera
he
would
come
away
enthusiastic
saying
by
jove
is
it
simply
splendid
of
course
i
have
the
ear
to
appreciate
it
i
not
musical
you
know
but
even
with
the
little
that
i
know
it
great
it
absolutely
puts
me
to
sleep
and
of
each
new
novel
that
he
bought
he
said
it
a
perfectly
wonderful
book
of
course
i
have
the
head
to
understand
it
so
i
did
finish
it
but
simply
thrilling
similarly
with
painting
it
one
of
the
most
marvellous
pictures
i
ever
saw
he
would
say
of
course
i
no
eye
for
pictures
and
i
could
see
anything
in
it
but
it
wonderful
the
career
of
spillikins
up
to
the
point
of
which
we
are
speaking
had
hitherto
not
been
very
satisfactory
or
at
least
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
boulder
who
was
his
uncle
and
trustee
first
idea
had
been
to
have
spillikins
attend
the
university
boomer
the
president
had
done
his
best
to
spread
abroad
the
idea
that
a
university
education
was
perfectly
suitable
even
for
the
rich
that
it
did
follow
that
because
a
man
was
a
university
graduate
he
need
either
work
or
pursue
his
studies
any
further
that
what
the
university
aimed
to
do
was
merely
to
put
a
certain
stamp
upon
a
man
that
was
all
and
this
stamp
according
to
the
tenor
of
the
president
convocation
addresses
was
perfectly
harmless
no
one
ought
to
be
afraid
of
it
as
a
result
a
great
many
of
the
very
best
young
men
in
the
city
who
had
no
need
for
education
at
all
were
beginning
to
attend
college
it
marked
said
boomer
a
revolution
spillikins
himself
was
fascinated
with
his
studies
the
professors
seemed
to
him
living
wonders
by
jove
he
said
the
professor
of
mathematics
is
a
marvel
you
ought
to
see
him
explaining
trigonometry
on
the
blackboard
you
understand
a
word
of
it
he
hardly
knew
which
of
his
studies
he
liked
best
physics
he
said
is
a
wonderful
study
i
got
five
per
cent
in
it
but
by
jove
i
had
to
work
for
it
i
go
in
for
it
altogether
if
they
let
me
but
that
was
just
the
trouble
they
would
and
so
in
course
of
time
spillikins
was
compelled
for
academic
reasons
to
abandon
his
life
work
his
last
words
about
it
were
gad
i
nearly
passed
in
trigonometry
and
he
always
said
afterwards
that
he
had
got
a
tremendous
lot
out
of
the
university
after
that
as
he
had
to
leave
the
university
his
trustee
boulder
put
spillikins
into
business
it
was
of
course
his
own
business
one
of
the
many
enterprises
for
which
spillikins
ever
since
he
was
had
already
been
signing
documents
and
countersigning
cheques
so
spillikins
found
himself
in
a
mahogany
office
selling
wholesale
oil
and
he
liked
it
he
said
that
business
sharpened
one
up
tremendously
i
afraid
spillikins
a
caller
in
the
mahogany
office
would
say
that
we
ca
meet
you
at
five
dollars
four
seventy
is
the
best
we
can
do
on
the
present
market
my
dear
chap
said
spillikins
that
all
right
after
all
thirty
cents
is
much
eh
what
dash
it
old
man
we
wo
fight
about
thirty
cents
how
much
do
you
want
well
at
four
seventy
we
take
twenty
thousand
barrels
by
jove
said
spillikins
twenty
thousand
barrels
gad
you
want
a
lot
do
you
pretty
big
sale
eh
for
a
beginner
like
me
i
guess
uncle
be
tickled
to
death
so
tickled
was
he
that
after
a
few
weeks
of
boulder
urged
spillikins
to
retire
and
wrote
off
many
thousand
dollars
from
the
capital
value
of
his
estate
so
after
this
there
was
only
one
thing
for
spillikins
to
do
and
everybody
told
him
so
namely
to
get
married
spillikins
said
his
friends
at
the
club
after
they
had
taken
all
his
loose
money
over
the
card
table
you
ought
to
get
married
think
so
said
spillikins
goodness
knows
he
was
willing
enough
in
fact
up
to
this
point
spillikins
whole
existence
had
been
one
long
aspiring
sigh
directed
towards
the
joys
of
matrimony
in
his
brief
college
days
his
timid
glances
had
wandered
by
an
irresistible
attraction
towards
the
seats
on
the
side
of
the
class
room
where
the
girls
of
the
first
year
sat
with
golden
pigtails
down
their
backs
doing
trigonometry
he
would
have
married
any
of
them
but
when
a
girl
can
work
out
trigonometry
at
sight
what
use
can
she
possibly
have
for
marriage
none
spillikins
knew
this
and
it
kept
him
silent
and
even
when
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
class
married
the
demonstrator
and
thus
terminated
her
studies
in
her
second
year
spillikins
realized
that
it
was
only
because
the
man
was
undeniably
a
demonstrator
and
knew
things
later
on
when
spillikins
went
into
business
and
into
society
the
same
fate
pursued
him
he
loved
for
at
least
six
months
georgiana
mcteague
the
niece
of
the
presbyterian
minister
of
osoph
he
loved
her
so
well
that
for
her
sake
he
temporarily
abandoned
his
pew
at
asaph
which
was
episcopalian
and
listened
to
fourteen
consecutive
sermons
on
hell
but
the
affair
got
no
further
than
that
once
or
twice
indeed
spillikins
walked
home
with
georgiana
from
church
and
talked
about
hell
with
her
and
once
her
uncle
asked
him
into
the
manse
for
cold
supper
after
evening
service
and
they
had
a
long
talk
about
hell
all
through
the
meal
and
upstairs
in
the
afterwards
but
somehow
spillikins
could
get
no
further
with
it
he
read
up
all
he
could
about
hell
so
as
to
be
able
to
talk
with
georgiana
but
in
the
end
it
failed
a
young
minister
fresh
from
college
came
and
preached
at
osoph
six
special
sermons
on
the
absolute
certainty
of
eternal
punishment
and
he
married
miss
mcteague
as
a
result
of
it
and
meantime
spillikins
had
got
engaged
or
practically
so
to
adelina
lightleigh
not
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
but
he
considered
himself
bound
to
her
for
her
sake
he
had
given
up
hell
altogether
and
was
dancing
till
two
in
the
morning
and
studying
action
bridge
out
of
a
book
for
a
time
he
felt
so
sure
that
she
meant
to
have
him
that
he
began
bringing
his
greatest
friend
edward
ruff
of
the
college
football
team
of
whom
spillikins
was
very
proud
up
to
the
residence
he
specially
wanted
adelina
and
edward
to
be
great
friends
so
that
adelina
and
he
might
ask
edward
up
to
the
house
after
he
was
married
and
they
got
to
be
such
great
friends
and
so
quickly
that
they
were
married
in
new
york
that
autumn
after
which
spillikins
used
to
be
invited
up
to
the
house
by
edward
and
adelina
they
both
used
to
tell
him
how
much
they
owed
him
and
they
too
used
to
join
in
the
chorus
and
say
you
know
peter
you
awfully
silly
not
to
get
married
now
all
this
had
happened
and
finished
at
about
the
time
when
the
society
ran
its
course
at
its
first
meeting
spillikins
had
met
dulphemia
at
the
very
sight
of
her
he
began
reading
up
the
life
of
buddha
and
a
translation
of
the
upanishads
so
as
to
fit
himself
to
aspire
to
live
with
her
even
when
the
society
ended
in
disaster
spillikins
love
only
burned
the
stronger
consequently
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
and
were
going
away
for
the
summer
and
that
dulphemia
was
to
go
to
stay
with
the
newberrys
at
castel
casteggio
this
latter
place
the
summer
retreat
of
the
newberrys
became
the
one
spot
on
earth
for
peter
spillikins
naturally
therefore
spillikins
was
presently
transported
to
the
seventh
heaven
when
in
due
course
of
time
he
received
a
note
which
said
we
shall
be
so
pleased
if
you
can
come
out
and
spend
a
week
or
two
with
us
here
we
will
send
the
car
down
to
the
thursday
train
to
meet
you
we
live
here
in
the
simplest
fashion
possible
in
fact
as
newberry
says
we
are
just
roughing
it
but
i
am
sure
you
mind
for
a
change
dulphemia
is
with
us
but
we
are
quite
a
small
party
the
note
was
signed
margaret
newberry
and
was
written
on
heavy
cream
paper
with
a
silver
monogram
such
as
people
use
when
roughing
it
the
newberrys
like
everybody
else
went
away
from
town
in
the
summertime
newberry
being
still
in
business
after
a
fashion
it
would
not
have
looked
well
for
him
to
remain
in
town
throughout
the
year
it
would
have
created
a
bad
impression
on
the
market
as
to
how
much
he
was
making
in
fact
in
the
early
summer
everybody
went
out
of
town
the
few
who
ever
revisited
the
place
in
august
reported
that
they
had
seen
a
soul
on
the
street
it
was
a
sort
of
longing
for
the
simple
life
for
nature
that
came
over
everybody
some
people
sought
it
at
the
seaside
where
nature
had
thrown
out
her
broad
plank
walks
and
her
long
piers
and
her
vaudeville
shows
others
sought
it
in
the
heart
of
the
country
where
nature
had
spread
her
oiled
motor
roads
and
her
wayside
inns
others
like
the
newberrys
preferred
to
rough
it
in
country
residences
of
their
own
some
of
the
people
as
already
said
went
for
business
reasons
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
having
to
work
all
the
year
round
others
went
to
europe
to
avoid
the
reproach
of
living
always
in
america
others
perhaps
most
people
went
for
medical
reasons
being
sent
away
by
their
doctors
not
that
they
were
ill
but
the
doctors
of
plutoria
avenue
such
as
doctor
slyder
always
preferred
to
send
all
their
patients
out
of
town
during
the
summer
months
no
doctor
cares
to
be
bothered
with
them
and
of
course
patients
even
when
they
are
anxious
to
go
anywhere
on
their
own
account
much
prefer
to
be
sent
there
by
their
doctor
my
dear
madam
slyder
would
say
to
a
lady
who
as
he
knew
was
most
anxious
to
go
to
virginia
there
really
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
here
he
spoke
the
truth
it
not
a
case
of
treatment
simply
a
matter
of
dropping
everything
and
going
away
now
why
you
go
for
a
month
or
two
to
some
quiet
place
where
you
will
simply
nothing
she
never
as
he
knew
did
anything
anyway
what
do
you
say
to
hot
springs
virginia
absolute
quiet
good
golf
not
a
soul
there
plenty
of
tennis
or
else
he
would
say
my
dear
madam
you
simply
why
do
you
just
drop
everything
and
go
to
canada
perfectly
quiet
not
a
soul
there
and
i
believe
nowadays
quite
fashionable
thus
after
all
the
patients
had
been
sent
away
slyder
and
his
colleagues
of
plutoria
avenue
managed
to
slip
away
themselves
for
a
month
or
two
heading
straight
for
paris
and
vienna
there
they
were
able
so
they
said
to
keep
in
touch
with
what
continental
doctors
were
doing
they
probably
were
now
it
so
happened
that
both
the
parents
of
miss
dulphemia
had
been
sent
out
of
town
in
this
fashion
distressing
experience
with
had
left
her
in
a
condition
in
which
she
was
utterly
fit
for
nothing
except
to
go
on
a
mediterranean
cruise
with
about
eighty
other
people
also
fit
for
nothing
himself
though
never
exactly
an
invalid
had
confessed
that
after
all
the
fuss
of
the
business
he
needed
bracing
up
needed
putting
into
shape
and
had
put
himself
into
slyder
hands
the
doctor
had
examined
him
questioned
him
searchingly
as
to
what
he
drank
and
ended
by
prescribing
port
wine
to
be
taken
firmly
and
unflinchingly
during
the
evening
and
for
the
daytime
at
any
moment
of
exhaustion
a
light
cordial
such
as
rye
whiskey
or
rum
and
vichy
water
in
addition
to
which
slyder
had
recommended
to
leave
town
why
do
you
go
down
to
nagahakett
on
the
atlantic
he
said
is
that
in
maine
said
in
horror
oh
dear
me
no
answered
the
doctor
reassuringly
it
in
new
brunswick
canada
excellent
place
most
liberal
licence
laws
first
class
cuisine
and
a
bar
in
the
hotel
no
tourists
no
golf
too
cold
to
swim
just
the
place
to
enjoy
oneself
so
had
gone
away
also
and
as
a
result
dulphemia
at
the
particular
moment
of
which
we
speak
was
declared
by
the
boudoir
and
society
column
of
the
daily
to
be
staying
with
and
newberry
at
their
charming
retreat
castel
casteggio
the
newberrys
belonged
to
the
class
of
people
whose
one
aim
in
the
summer
is
to
lead
the
simple
life
newberry
himself
said
that
his
one
idea
of
a
vacation
was
to
get
right
out
into
the
bush
and
put
on
old
clothes
and
just
eat
when
he
felt
like
it
this
was
why
he
had
built
castel
casteggio
it
stood
about
forty
miles
from
the
city
out
among
the
wooded
hills
on
the
shore
of
a
little
lake
except
for
the
fifteen
or
twenty
residences
like
it
that
dotted
the
sides
of
the
lake
it
was
entirely
isolated
the
only
way
to
reach
it
was
by
the
motor
road
that
wound
its
way
among
leafy
hills
from
the
railway
station
fifteen
miles
away
every
foot
of
the
road
was
private
property
as
all
nature
ought
to
be
the
whole
country
about
castel
casteggio
was
absolutely
primeval
or
at
any
rate
as
primeval
as
scotch
gardeners
and
french
landscape
artists
could
make
it
the
lake
itself
lay
like
a
sparkling
gem
from
nature
workshop
except
that
they
had
raised
the
level
of
it
ten
feet
the
sides
cleared
out
the
brush
and
put
a
motor
road
round
it
beyond
that
it
was
pure
nature
castel
casteggio
itself
a
beautiful
house
of
white
brick
with
sweeping
piazzas
and
glittering
conservatories
standing
among
great
trees
with
rolling
lawns
broken
with
as
the
ground
sloped
to
the
lake
was
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
house
of
all
at
any
rate
it
was
an
ideal
spot
to
wear
old
clothes
in
to
dine
early
at
and
except
for
tennis
parties
parties
lawn
teas
and
golf
to
live
absolutely
to
oneself
it
should
be
explained
that
the
house
was
not
called
castel
casteggio
because
the
newberrys
were
italian
they
were
not
nor
because
they
owned
estates
in
italy
they
did
nor
had
travelled
there
they
had
indeed
for
a
time
they
had
thought
of
giving
it
a
welsh
name
or
a
scotch
but
the
beautiful
country
residence
of
the
had
stood
close
by
in
the
same
primeval
country
was
already
called
and
the
woodland
retreat
of
the
just
across
the
little
lake
was
called
and
the
charming
chalet
of
the
was
called
so
it
seemed
fairer
to
select
an
italian
name
by
jove
miss
furlong
how
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
down
the
little
suburban
train
two
cars
only
both
first
class
for
the
train
went
nowhere
except
out
into
the
primeval
wilderness
had
drawn
up
at
the
diminutive
roadside
station
spillikins
had
alighted
and
there
was
miss
philippa
furlong
sitting
behind
the
chauffeur
in
the
newberrys
motor
she
was
looking
as
beautiful
as
only
the
younger
sister
of
a
high
church
episcopalian
rector
can
look
dressed
in
white
the
colour
of
saintliness
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
july
there
was
no
doubt
about
philippa
furlong
her
beauty
was
of
that
peculiar
and
almost
sacred
kind
found
only
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
high
church
clergy
it
was
admitted
by
all
who
envied
or
admired
her
that
she
could
enter
a
church
more
gracefully
move
more
swimmingly
up
the
aisle
and
pray
better
than
any
girl
on
plutoria
avenue
spillikins
as
he
gazed
at
her
in
her
white
summer
dress
and
wide
picture
hat
with
her
parasol
nodding
above
her
head
realized
that
after
all
religion
as
embodied
in
the
younger
sisters
of
the
high
church
clergy
fills
a
great
place
in
the
world
by
jove
he
repeated
how
awfully
good
of
you
not
a
bit
said
philippa
hop
in
dulphemia
was
coming
but
she
could
is
that
all
you
have
with
you
the
last
remark
was
ironical
it
referred
to
the
two
quite
large
steamer
trunks
of
spillikins
that
were
being
loaded
together
with
his
tennis
racket
and
golf
kit
on
to
the
fore
part
of
the
motor
spillikins
as
a
young
man
of
social
experience
had
roughed
it
before
he
knew
what
a
lot
of
clothes
one
needs
for
it
so
the
motor
sped
away
and
went
bowling
noiselessly
over
the
oiled
road
and
turning
corners
where
the
green
boughs
of
the
great
trees
almost
swished
in
their
faces
and
rounding
and
twisting
among
curves
of
the
hills
as
it
carried
spillikins
and
philippa
away
from
the
lower
domain
or
ordinary
fields
and
farms
up
into
the
enchanted
country
of
private
property
and
the
magic
castles
of
casteggio
and
spillikins
must
have
assured
philippa
at
least
a
dozen
times
in
starting
off
how
awfully
good
it
was
of
her
to
come
down
in
the
motor
and
he
was
so
pleased
at
her
coming
to
meet
him
that
philippa
never
even
hinted
that
the
truth
was
that
she
had
expected
somebody
else
on
the
same
train
for
to
a
girl
brought
up
in
the
principles
of
the
high
church
the
truth
is
a
very
sacred
thing
she
keeps
it
to
herself
and
naturally
with
such
a
sympathetic
listener
it
was
not
long
before
spillikins
had
begun
to
talk
of
dulphemia
and
his
hopes
i
do
know
whether
she
really
cares
for
me
or
not
said
spillikins
but
i
have
pretty
good
hope
the
other
day
or
at
least
about
two
months
ago
at
one
of
the
meetings
you
were
not
in
that
were
you
he
said
breaking
off
only
just
at
the
beginning
said
philippa
we
went
to
bermuda
oh
yes
i
remember
do
you
know
i
thought
it
pretty
rough
at
the
end
especially
on
ram
spudd
i
liked
him
i
sent
him
two
pounds
of
tobacco
to
the
penitentiary
last
week
you
can
get
it
in
to
them
you
know
if
you
know
how
but
what
were
you
going
to
say
asked
philippa
oh
yes
said
spillikins
and
he
realized
that
he
had
actually
drifted
off
the
topic
of
dulphemia
a
thing
that
had
never
happened
to
him
before
i
was
going
to
say
that
at
one
of
the
meetings
you
know
i
asked
her
if
i
might
call
her
dulphemia
and
what
did
she
say
to
that
asked
philippa
she
said
she
did
care
what
i
called
her
so
i
think
that
looks
pretty
good
do
you
awfully
good
said
philippa
and
a
little
after
that
i
took
her
slippers
home
from
the
charity
ball
at
the
grand
palaver
archie
jones
took
her
home
herself
in
his
car
but
i
took
her
slippers
she
forgotten
them
i
thought
that
a
pretty
good
sign
was
it
you
would
let
a
chap
carry
round
your
slippers
unless
you
knew
him
pretty
well
would
you
miss
philippa
oh
no
nobody
would
said
philippa
this
of
course
was
a
standing
principle
of
the
anglican
church
and
a
little
after
that
dulphemia
and
charlie
mostyn
and
i
were
walking
to
buncomhearst
musical
and
we
only
just
started
along
the
street
when
she
stopped
and
sent
me
back
for
her
music
me
mind
you
not
charlie
that
seems
to
me
awfully
significant
it
seems
to
speak
volumes
said
philippa
does
it
said
spillikins
you
do
mind
my
telling
you
all
about
this
miss
philippa
he
added
incidentally
spillikins
felt
that
it
was
all
right
to
call
her
miss
philippa
because
she
had
a
sister
who
was
really
miss
furlong
so
it
would
have
been
quite
wrong
as
spillikins
realized
to
have
called
miss
philippa
by
her
surname
in
any
case
the
beauty
of
the
morning
was
against
it
i
do
mind
a
bit
said
philippa
i
think
it
awfully
nice
of
you
to
tell
me
about
it
she
did
add
that
she
knew
all
about
it
already
you
see
said
spillikins
you
so
awfully
sympathetic
it
makes
it
so
easy
to
talk
to
you
with
other
girls
especially
with
clever
ones
even
with
dulphemia
i
often
feel
a
perfect
jackass
beside
them
but
i
don
t
feel
that
way
with
you
at
all
do
you
really
said
philippa
but
the
honest
admiration
in
spillikin
protruding
blue
eyes
forbade
a
sarcastic
answer
by
jove
said
spillikins
presently
with
complete
irrelevance
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
saying
it
but
you
look
awfully
well
in
white
stunning
he
felt
that
a
man
who
was
affianced
or
practically
so
was
allowed
the
smaller
liberty
of
paying
honest
compliments
oh
this
old
thing
laughed
philippa
with
a
contemptuous
shake
of
her
dress
but
up
here
you
know
we
just
wear
anything
she
say
that
this
old
thing
was
only
two
weeks
old
and
had
cost
eighty
dollars
or
the
equivalent
of
one
person
pew
rent
at
asaph
for
six
months
and
after
that
they
had
only
time
so
it
seemed
to
spillikins
for
two
or
three
remarks
and
he
had
scarcely
had
leisure
to
reflect
what
a
charming
girl
philippa
had
grown
to
be
since
she
went
to
bermuda
the
effect
no
doubt
of
the
climate
of
those
fortunate
islands
when
quite
suddenly
they
rounded
a
curve
into
an
avenue
of
nodding
trees
and
there
were
the
great
lawn
and
wide
piazzas
and
the
conservatories
of
castel
casteggio
right
in
front
of
them
here
we
are
said
philippa
and
there
newberry
out
on
the
lawn
now
here
newberry
was
saying
a
little
later
waving
his
hand
is
where
you
get
what
i
think
the
finest
view
of
the
place
he
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
lawn
where
it
sloped
dotted
with
great
trees
to
the
banks
of
the
little
lake
and
was
showing
spillikins
the
beauties
of
castel
casteggio
newberry
wore
on
his
short
circular
person
the
summer
costume
of
a
man
taking
his
ease
and
careless
of
dress
plain
white
flannel
trousers
not
worth
more
than
six
dollars
a
leg
an
ordinary
white
silk
shirt
with
a
rolled
collar
that
could
have
cost
more
than
fifteen
dollars
and
on
his
head
an
ordinary
panama
hat
say
forty
dollars
by
jove
said
spillikins
as
he
looked
about
him
at
the
house
and
the
beautiful
lawn
with
its
great
trees
it
a
lovely
place
is
it
said
newberry
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
it
when
i
took
hold
of
it
to
make
the
motor
road
alone
i
had
to
dynamite
out
about
a
hundred
yards
of
rock
and
then
i
fetched
up
cement
tons
and
tons
of
it
and
boulders
to
buttress
the
embankment
did
you
really
said
spillikins
looking
at
newberry
with
great
respect
yes
and
even
that
was
nothing
to
the
house
itself
do
you
know
i
had
to
go
at
least
forty
feet
for
the
foundations
first
i
went
through
about
twenty
feet
of
loose
clay
after
that
i
struck
sand
and
i
no
sooner
got
through
that
than
by
george
i
landed
in
eight
feet
of
water
i
had
to
pump
it
out
i
think
i
took
out
a
thousand
gallons
before
i
got
clear
down
to
the
rock
then
i
took
my
solid
steel
beams
in
lengths
here
newberry
imitated
with
his
arms
the
action
of
a
man
setting
up
a
steel
beam
and
set
them
upright
and
bolted
them
on
the
rock
after
that
i
threw
my
steel
girders
across
clapped
on
my
roof
rafters
all
steel
in
pieces
and
then
just
held
it
easily
just
supported
it
a
bit
and
let
it
sink
gradually
to
its
place
newberry
illustrated
with
his
two
arms
the
action
of
a
huge
house
being
allowed
to
sink
slowly
to
a
firm
rest
you
do
say
so
said
spillikins
lost
in
amazement
at
the
wonderful
physical
strength
that
newberry
must
have
excuse
me
just
a
minute
broke
off
newberry
while
i
smooth
out
the
gravel
where
you
standing
you
rather
disturbed
it
afraid
oh
i
awfully
sorry
said
spillikins
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
his
host
i
do
mind
in
the
least
it
only
on
account
of
mcalister
who
asked
spillikins
my
gardener
he
does
care
to
have
us
walk
on
the
gravel
paths
it
scuffs
up
the
gravel
so
but
sometimes
one
forgets
it
should
be
said
here
for
the
sake
of
clearness
that
one
of
the
chief
glories
of
castel
casteggio
lay
in
its
servants
all
of
them
it
goes
without
saying
had
been
brought
from
great
britain
the
comfort
they
gave
to
and
newberry
was
unspeakable
in
fact
as
they
themselves
admitted
servants
of
the
kind
are
simply
not
to
be
found
in
america
our
scotch
gardener
newberry
always
explained
is
a
perfect
character
i
do
know
how
we
could
get
another
like
him
do
you
know
my
dear
he
simply
wo
allow
us
to
pick
the
roses
and
if
any
of
us
walk
across
the
grass
he
is
furious
and
he
positively
refuses
to
let
us
use
the
vegetables
he
told
me
quite
plainly
that
if
we
took
any
of
his
young
peas
or
his
early
cucumbers
he
would
leave
we
are
to
have
them
later
on
when
he
finished
growing
them
how
delightful
it
is
to
have
servants
of
that
sort
the
lady
addressed
would
murmur
so
devoted
and
so
different
from
servants
on
this
side
of
the
water
just
imagine
my
dear
my
chauffeur
when
i
was
in
colorado
actually
threatened
to
leave
me
merely
because
i
wanted
to
reduce
his
wages
i
think
it
these
wretched
labour
unions
i
sure
it
is
of
course
we
have
trouble
with
mcalister
at
times
but
he
always
very
reasonable
when
we
put
things
in
the
right
light
last
week
for
example
i
was
afraid
that
we
had
gone
too
far
with
him
he
is
always
accustomed
to
have
a
quart
of
beer
every
morning
at
ten
the
maids
are
told
to
bring
it
out
to
him
and
after
that
he
goes
to
sleep
in
the
little
arbour
beside
the
tulip
bed
and
the
other
day
when
he
went
there
he
found
that
one
of
our
guests
who
had
been
told
was
actually
sitting
in
there
reading
of
course
he
was
i
was
afraid
for
the
moment
that
he
would
give
notice
on
the
spot
what
you
have
done
positively
my
dear
i
do
know
but
we
explained
to
him
at
once
that
it
was
only
an
accident
and
that
the
person
had
known
and
that
of
course
it
would
occur
again
after
that
he
was
softened
a
little
but
he
went
off
muttering
to
himself
and
that
evening
he
dug
up
all
the
new
tulips
and
threw
them
over
the
fence
we
saw
him
do
it
but
we
did
dare
say
anything
oh
no
echoed
the
other
lady
if
you
had
you
might
have
lost
him
exactly
and
i
do
think
we
could
possibly
get
another
man
like
him
at
least
not
on
this
side
of
the
water
but
come
said
newberry
after
he
had
finished
adjusting
the
gravel
with
his
foot
there
are
newberry
and
the
girls
on
the
verandah
let
go
and
join
them
a
few
minutes
later
spillikins
was
talking
with
newberry
and
dulphemia
and
telling
newberry
what
a
beautiful
house
she
had
beside
them
stood
philippa
furlong
and
she
had
her
arm
around
dulphemia
waist
and
the
picture
that
they
thus
made
with
their
heads
close
together
dulphemia
hair
being
golden
and
philippa
was
such
that
spillikins
had
no
eyes
for
newberry
nor
for
castel
casteggio
nor
for
anything
so
much
so
that
he
practically
did
see
at
all
the
little
girl
in
green
that
stood
unobtrusively
on
the
further
side
of
newberry
indeed
though
somebody
had
murmured
her
name
in
introduction
he
could
have
repeated
it
if
asked
two
minutes
afterwards
his
eyes
and
his
mind
were
elsewhere
but
hers
were
not
for
the
little
girl
in
green
looked
at
spillikins
with
wide
eyes
and
when
she
looked
at
him
she
saw
all
at
once
such
wonderful
things
about
him
as
nobody
had
ever
seen
before
for
she
could
see
from
the
poise
of
his
head
how
awfully
clever
he
was
and
from
the
way
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
side
pockets
she
could
see
how
manly
and
brave
he
must
be
and
of
course
there
was
firmness
and
strength
written
all
over
him
in
short
she
saw
as
she
looked
such
a
peter
spillikins
as
truly
never
existed
or
could
exist
or
at
least
such
a
peter
spillikins
as
no
one
else
in
the
world
had
ever
suspected
before
all
in
a
moment
she
was
ever
so
glad
that
she
accepted
invitation
to
castel
casteggio
and
had
been
afraid
to
come
for
the
little
girl
in
green
whose
christian
name
was
norah
was
only
what
is
called
a
poor
relation
of
newberry
and
her
father
was
a
person
of
no
account
whatever
who
did
belong
to
the
mausoleum
club
or
to
any
other
club
and
who
lived
with
norah
on
a
street
that
nobody
who
was
anybody
lived
upon
norah
had
been
asked
up
a
few
days
before
out
of
the
city
to
give
her
air
which
is
the
only
thing
that
can
be
safely
and
freely
given
to
poor
relations
thus
she
had
arrived
at
castel
casteggio
with
one
diminutive
trunk
so
small
and
shabby
that
even
the
servants
who
carried
it
upstairs
were
ashamed
of
it
in
it
were
a
pair
of
brand
new
tennis
shoes
at
ninety
cents
reduced
to
and
a
white
dress
of
the
kind
that
is
called
almost
evening
and
such
few
other
things
as
poor
relations
might
bring
with
fear
and
trembling
to
join
in
the
simple
rusticity
of
the
rich
thus
stood
norah
looking
at
spillikins
as
for
him
such
is
the
contrariety
of
human
things
he
had
no
eyes
for
her
at
all
what
a
perfectly
charming
house
this
is
spillikins
was
saying
he
always
said
this
on
such
occasions
but
it
seemed
to
the
little
girl
in
green
that
he
spoke
with
wonderful
social
ease
i
am
so
glad
you
think
so
said
newberry
this
was
what
she
always
answered
you
no
idea
what
work
it
has
been
this
year
we
put
in
all
this
new
glass
in
the
east
conservatory
over
a
thousand
panes
such
a
tremendous
business
i
was
just
telling
spillikins
said
newberry
about
the
work
we
had
blasting
out
the
motor
road
you
can
see
the
gap
where
it
lies
better
from
here
i
think
spillikins
i
must
have
exploded
a
ton
and
a
half
of
dynamite
on
it
by
jove
said
spillikins
it
must
be
dangerous
work
eh
i
wonder
you
are
afraid
of
it
one
simply
gets
used
to
it
that
all
said
newberry
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
of
course
it
is
dangerous
i
blew
up
two
italians
on
the
last
job
he
paused
a
minute
and
added
musingly
hardy
fellows
the
italians
i
prefer
them
to
any
other
people
for
blasting
did
you
blow
them
up
yourself
asked
spillikins
i
was
here
answered
newberry
in
fact
i
never
care
to
be
here
when
i
blasting
we
go
to
town
but
i
had
to
foot
the
bill
for
them
all
the
same
quite
right
too
the
risk
of
course
was
mine
not
theirs
that
the
law
you
know
they
cost
me
two
thousand
each
but
come
said
newberry
i
think
we
must
go
and
dress
for
dinner
franklin
will
be
frightfully
put
out
if
we
late
franklin
is
our
butler
she
went
on
seeing
that
spillikins
did
understand
the
reference
and
as
we
brought
him
out
from
england
we
have
to
be
rather
careful
with
a
good
man
like
franklin
one
is
always
so
afraid
of
losing
him
and
after
last
night
we
have
to
be
doubly
careful
why
last
night
asked
spillikins
oh
it
was
much
said
newberry
in
fact
it
was
merely
an
accident
only
it
just
chanced
that
at
dinner
quite
late
in
the
meal
when
we
had
had
nearly
everything
we
dine
very
simply
here
spillikins
newberry
who
was
thirsty
and
who
was
really
thinking
what
he
was
saying
asked
franklin
to
give
him
a
glass
of
hock
franklin
said
at
once
very
sorry
sir
i
do
care
to
serve
hock
after
the
entree
and
of
course
he
was
right
said
dulphemia
with
emphasis
exactly
he
was
perfectly
right
they
know
you
know
we
were
afraid
that
there
might
be
trouble
but
newberry
went
and
saw
franklin
afterwards
and
he
behaved
very
well
over
it
but
suppose
we
go
and
dress
six
already
and
we
only
an
hour
in
this
congenial
company
spillikins
spent
the
next
three
days
life
at
castel
casteggio
as
the
newberrys
loved
to
explain
was
conducted
on
the
very
simplest
plan
early
breakfast
country
fashion
at
nine
after
that
nothing
to
eat
till
lunch
unless
one
cared
to
have
lemonade
or
bottled
ale
sent
out
with
a
biscuit
or
a
macaroon
to
the
tennis
court
lunch
itself
was
a
perfectly
plain
midday
meal
lasting
till
about
and
consisting
simply
of
cold
meats
say
four
kinds
and
salads
with
perhaps
a
made
dish
or
two
and
for
anybody
who
cared
for
it
a
hot
steak
or
a
chop
or
both
after
that
one
had
coffee
and
cigarettes
in
the
shade
of
the
piazza
and
waited
for
afternoon
tea
this
latter
was
served
at
a
wicker
table
in
any
part
of
the
grounds
that
the
gardener
was
not
at
that
moment
clipping
trimming
or
otherwise
using
afternoon
tea
being
over
one
rested
or
walked
on
the
lawn
till
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
this
simple
routine
was
broken
only
by
irruptions
of
people
in
motors
or
motor
boats
from
or
chalet
the
whole
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
spillikins
or
dulphemia
or
philippa
represented
rusticity
itself
to
the
little
girl
in
green
it
seemed
as
brilliant
as
the
court
of
versailles
especially
evening
dinner
a
plain
home
meal
as
the
others
thought
it
when
she
had
four
glasses
to
drink
out
of
and
used
to
wonder
over
such
problems
as
whether
you
were
supposed
when
franklin
poured
out
wine
to
tell
him
to
stop
or
to
wait
till
he
stopped
without
being
told
to
stop
and
other
similar
mysteries
such
as
many
people
before
and
after
have
meditated
upon
during
all
this
time
spillikins
was
nerving
himself
to
propose
to
dulphemia
in
fact
he
spent
part
of
his
time
walking
up
and
down
under
the
trees
with
philippa
furlong
and
discussing
with
her
the
proposal
that
he
meant
to
make
together
with
such
topics
as
marriage
in
general
and
his
own
unworthiness
he
might
have
waited
indefinitely
had
he
not
learned
on
the
third
day
of
his
visit
that
dulphemia
was
to
go
away
in
the
morning
to
join
her
father
at
nagahakett
that
evening
he
found
the
necessary
nerve
to
speak
and
the
proposal
in
almost
every
aspect
of
it
was
most
successful
by
jove
spillikins
said
to
philippa
furlong
next
morning
in
explaining
what
had
happened
she
was
awfully
nice
about
it
i
think
she
must
have
guessed
in
a
way
do
you
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
at
any
rate
she
was
awfully
nice
let
me
say
everything
i
wanted
and
when
i
explained
what
a
fool
i
was
she
said
she
did
think
i
was
half
such
a
fool
as
people
thought
me
but
it
all
right
it
turns
out
that
she
is
thinking
of
getting
married
i
asked
her
if
i
might
always
go
on
thinking
of
her
and
she
said
i
might
and
that
morning
when
dulphemia
was
carried
off
in
the
motor
to
the
station
spillikins
without
exactly
being
aware
how
he
had
done
it
had
somehow
transferred
himself
to
philippa
is
she
a
splendid
girl
he
said
at
least
ten
times
a
day
to
norah
the
little
girl
in
green
and
norah
always
agreed
because
she
really
thought
philippa
a
perfectly
wonderful
creature
there
is
no
doubt
that
but
for
a
slight
shift
of
circumstances
spillikins
would
have
proposed
to
miss
furlong
indeed
he
spent
a
good
part
of
his
time
rehearsing
little
speeches
that
began
of
course
i
know
i
an
awful
ass
in
a
way
or
of
course
i
know
that
i
not
at
all
the
sort
of
fellow
and
so
on
but
not
one
of
them
ever
was
delivered
for
it
so
happened
that
on
the
thursday
one
week
after
spillikins
arrival
philippa
went
again
to
the
station
in
the
motor
and
when
she
came
back
there
was
another
passenger
with
her
a
tall
young
man
in
tweed
and
they
both
began
calling
out
to
the
newberrys
from
a
distance
of
at
least
a
hundred
yards
and
both
the
newberrys
suddenly
exclaimed
why
it
tom
and
rushed
off
to
meet
the
motor
and
there
was
such
a
laughing
and
jubilation
as
the
two
descended
and
carried
tom
valises
to
the
verandah
that
spillikins
felt
as
suddenly
and
completely
out
of
it
as
the
little
girl
in
green
herself
especially
as
his
ear
had
caught
among
the
first
things
said
the
words
congratulate
us
newberry
we
engaged
after
which
spillikins
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
and
listening
while
it
was
explained
in
wicker
chairs
on
the
verandah
that
philippa
and
tom
had
been
engaged
already
for
ever
so
long
in
fact
nearly
two
weeks
only
they
had
agreed
not
to
say
a
word
to
anybody
till
tom
had
gone
to
north
carolina
and
back
to
see
his
people
and
as
to
who
tom
was
or
what
was
the
relation
between
tom
and
the
newberrys
spillikins
neither
knew
or
cared
nor
did
it
interest
him
in
the
least
that
philippa
had
met
tom
in
bermuda
and
that
she
had
known
that
he
even
knew
the
newberry
nor
any
other
of
the
exuberant
disclosures
of
the
moment
in
fact
if
there
was
any
one
period
rather
than
another
when
spillikins
felt
corroborated
in
his
private
view
of
himself
it
was
at
this
moment
so
the
next
day
tom
and
philippa
vanished
together
we
shall
be
quite
a
small
party
now
said
newberry
in
fact
quite
by
ourselves
till
everleigh
comes
and
she
wo
be
here
for
a
fortnight
at
which
the
heart
of
the
little
girl
in
green
was
glad
because
she
had
been
afraid
that
other
girls
might
be
coming
whereas
she
knew
that
everleigh
was
a
widow
with
four
sons
and
must
be
ever
so
old
past
forty
the
next
few
days
were
spent
by
spillikins
almost
entirely
in
the
society
of
norah
he
thought
them
on
the
whole
rather
pleasant
days
but
slow
to
her
they
were
an
uninterrupted
dream
of
happiness
never
to
be
forgotten
the
newberrys
left
them
to
themselves
not
with
any
intent
it
was
merely
that
they
were
perpetually
busy
walking
about
the
grounds
of
castel
casteggio
blowing
up
things
with
dynamite
throwing
steel
bridges
over
gullies
and
hoisting
heavy
timber
with
derricks
nor
were
they
to
blame
for
it
for
it
had
not
always
been
theirs
to
command
dynamite
and
control
the
forces
of
nature
there
had
been
a
time
now
long
ago
when
the
two
newberrys
had
lived
both
of
them
on
twenty
dollars
a
week
and
newberry
had
made
her
own
dresses
and
newberry
had
spent
vigorous
evenings
in
making
shelves
for
their
that
was
long
ago
and
since
then
newberry
like
many
other
people
of
those
earlier
days
had
risen
to
wealth
and
castel
casteggio
while
others
like
norah
father
had
stayed
just
where
they
were
so
the
newberrys
left
peter
and
norah
to
themselves
all
day
even
after
dinner
in
the
evening
newberry
was
very
apt
to
call
to
his
wife
in
the
dusk
from
some
distant
corner
of
the
lawn
margaret
come
over
here
and
tell
me
if
you
do
think
we
might
cut
down
this
elm
tear
the
stump
out
by
the
roots
and
throw
it
into
the
ravine
and
the
answer
was
one
minute
edward
just
wait
till
i
get
a
wrap
before
they
came
back
the
dusk
had
grown
to
darkness
and
they
had
redynamited
half
the
estate
during
all
of
which
time
spillikins
sat
with
norah
on
the
piazza
he
talked
and
she
listened
he
told
her
for
instance
all
about
his
terrific
experiences
in
the
oil
business
and
about
his
exciting
career
at
college
or
presently
they
went
indoors
and
norah
played
the
piano
and
spillikins
sat
and
smoked
and
listened
in
such
a
house
as
the
newberry
where
dynamite
and
the
greater
explosives
were
everyday
matters
a
little
thing
like
the
use
of
tobacco
in
the
did
count
as
for
the
music
go
right
ahead
said
spillikins
i
not
musical
but
i
do
mind
music
a
bit
in
the
daytime
they
played
tennis
there
was
a
court
at
one
end
of
the
lawn
beneath
the
trees
all
chequered
with
sunlight
and
mingled
shadow
very
beautiful
norah
thought
though
spillikins
explained
that
the
spotted
light
put
him
off
his
game
in
fact
it
was
owing
entirely
to
this
bad
light
that
spillikins
fast
drives
wonderful
though
they
were
somehow
never
got
inside
the
service
court
norah
of
course
thought
spillikins
a
wonderful
player
she
was
glad
in
fact
it
suited
them
both
when
he
beat
her
six
to
nothing
she
did
know
and
did
care
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
world
that
spillikins
could
beat
like
that
once
he
even
said
to
her
by
gad
you
do
play
half
a
bad
game
you
know
i
think
you
know
with
practice
you
come
on
quite
a
lot
after
that
the
games
were
understood
to
be
more
or
less
in
the
form
of
lessons
which
put
spillikins
on
a
pedestal
of
superiority
and
allowed
any
bad
strokes
on
his
part
to
be
viewed
as
a
form
of
indulgence
also
as
the
tennis
was
viewed
in
this
light
it
was
norah
part
to
pick
up
the
balls
at
the
net
and
throw
them
back
to
spillikins
he
let
her
do
this
not
from
rudeness
for
it
was
in
him
but
because
in
such
a
primeval
place
as
castel
casteggio
the
natural
primitive
relation
of
the
sexes
is
bound
to
reassert
itself
but
of
love
spillikins
never
thought
he
had
viewed
it
so
eagerly
and
so
often
from
a
distance
that
when
it
stood
here
modestly
at
his
very
elbow
he
did
not
recognize
its
presence
his
mind
had
been
fashioned
as
it
were
to
connect
love
with
something
stunning
and
sensational
with
easter
hats
and
harem
skirts
and
the
luxurious
consciousness
of
the
unattainable
even
at
that
there
is
no
knowing
what
might
have
happened
tennis
in
the
chequered
light
of
sun
and
shadow
cast
by
summer
leaves
is
a
dangerous
game
there
came
a
day
when
they
were
standing
one
each
side
of
the
net
and
spillikins
was
explaining
to
norah
the
proper
way
to
hold
a
racquet
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
those
magnificent
backhand
sweeps
of
his
by
which
he
generally
drove
the
ball
halfway
to
the
lake
and
explaining
this
involved
putting
his
hand
right
over
on
the
handle
of
the
racquet
so
that
for
just
half
a
second
her
hand
was
clasped
tight
in
his
and
if
that
had
been
lengthened
out
into
a
whole
second
it
is
quite
possible
that
what
was
already
subconscious
in
his
mind
would
have
broken
its
way
triumphantly
to
the
surface
and
norah
hand
would
have
stayed
in
his
how
willingly
for
the
rest
of
their
two
lives
but
just
at
that
moment
spillikins
looked
up
and
he
said
in
quite
an
altered
tone
by
jove
who
that
awfully
woman
getting
out
of
the
motor
and
their
hands
unclasped
norah
looked
over
towards
the
house
and
said
why
it
everleigh
i
thought
she
was
coming
for
another
week
i
say
said
spillikins
straining
his
short
sight
to
the
uttermost
what
perfectly
wonderful
golden
hair
eh
why
it
norah
began
and
then
she
stopped
it
did
seem
right
to
explain
that
everleigh
hair
was
dyed
and
who
that
tall
chap
standing
beside
her
said
spillikins
i
think
it
captain
cormorant
but
i
do
think
he
going
to
stay
he
only
brought
her
up
in
the
motor
from
town
by
jove
how
good
of
him
said
spillikins
and
this
sentiment
in
regard
to
captain
cormorant
though
he
did
know
it
was
to
become
a
keynote
of
his
existence
i
did
know
she
was
coming
so
soon
said
norah
and
there
was
weariness
already
in
her
heart
certainly
she
did
know
it
still
less
did
she
know
or
anyone
else
that
the
reason
of
coming
was
because
spillikins
was
there
she
came
with
a
set
purpose
and
she
sent
captain
cormorant
directly
back
in
the
motor
because
she
did
want
him
on
the
premises
ought
we
to
go
up
to
the
house
said
norah
all
right
said
spillikins
with
great
alacrity
let
go
now
as
this
story
began
with
the
information
that
everleigh
is
at
present
there
is
no
need
to
pursue
in
detail
the
stages
of
spillikins
wooing
its
course
was
swift
and
happy
spillikins
having
seen
the
back
of
everleigh
head
had
decided
instantly
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
that
impression
is
not
easily
corrected
in
the
of
a
shaded
nor
across
a
lighted
only
with
candles
with
deep
red
shades
nor
even
in
the
daytime
through
a
veil
in
any
case
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
if
everleigh
was
not
and
is
not
a
singularly
beautiful
woman
spillikins
still
know
it
and
in
point
of
attraction
the
homage
of
such
experts
as
captain
cormorant
and
lieutenant
hawk
speaks
for
itself
so
the
course
of
spillikins
love
for
love
it
must
have
been
ran
swiftly
to
its
goal
each
stage
of
it
was
duly
marked
by
his
comments
to
norah
she
a
splendid
woman
he
said
so
sympathetic
she
always
seems
to
know
just
what
one
going
to
say
so
she
did
for
she
was
making
him
say
it
by
jove
he
said
a
day
later
everleigh
an
awfully
fine
woman
is
she
i
was
telling
her
about
my
having
been
in
the
oil
business
for
a
little
while
and
she
thinks
that
i
really
be
awfully
good
in
money
things
she
said
she
wished
she
had
me
to
manage
her
money
for
her
this
also
was
quite
true
except
that
everleigh
had
not
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
management
of
her
money
was
of
the
form
generally
known
as
deficit
financing
in
fact
her
money
was
very
crudely
stated
nonexistent
and
it
needed
a
lot
of
management
a
day
or
two
later
spillikins
was
saying
i
think
everleigh
must
have
had
great
sorrow
do
you
yesterday
she
was
showing
me
a
photograph
of
her
little
boy
she
has
a
little
boy
you
know
yes
i
know
said
norah
she
did
add
that
she
knew
that
everleigh
had
and
she
was
saying
how
awfully
rough
it
is
having
him
always
away
from
her
at
something
academy
where
he
is
and
very
soon
after
that
spillikins
was
saying
with
quite
a
quaver
in
his
voice
by
jove
yes
i
awfully
lucky
i
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
have
me
you
know
a
woman
like
her
with
so
much
attention
and
everything
i
ca
imagine
what
she
sees
in
me
which
was
just
as
well
and
then
spillikins
checked
himself
for
he
noticed
this
was
on
the
verandah
in
the
morning
that
norah
had
a
hat
and
jacket
on
and
that
the
motor
was
rolling
towards
the
door
i
say
he
said
are
you
going
away
yes
did
you
know
norah
said
i
thought
you
heard
them
speaking
of
it
at
dinner
last
night
i
have
to
go
home
father
alone
you
know
oh
i
awfully
sorry
said
spillikins
we
sha
have
any
more
tennis
goodbye
said
norah
and
as
she
said
it
and
put
out
her
hand
there
were
tears
brimming
up
into
her
eyes
but
spillikins
being
short
of
sight
did
see
them
goodbye
he
said
then
as
the
motor
carried
her
away
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
sort
of
reverie
perhaps
certain
things
that
might
have
been
rose
unformed
and
inarticulate
before
his
mind
and
then
a
voice
called
from
the
within
in
a
measured
and
assured
tone
peter
darling
where
are
you
coming
cried
spillikins
and
he
came
on
the
second
day
of
the
engagement
everleigh
showed
to
peter
a
little
photograph
in
a
brooch
this
is
gib
my
second
little
boy
she
said
spillikins
started
to
say
i
did
know
and
then
checked
himself
and
said
by
gad
what
a
little
chap
eh
awfully
fond
of
boys
dear
little
fellow
is
he
said
everleigh
he
really
rather
taller
than
that
now
because
this
picture
was
taken
a
little
while
ago
and
the
next
day
she
said
this
is
willie
my
third
boy
and
on
the
day
after
that
she
said
this
is
sib
my
youngest
boy
i
sure
love
him
i
sure
i
shall
said
spillikins
he
loved
him
already
for
being
the
youngest
and
so
in
the
fulness
of
time
nor
was
it
so
very
full
either
in
fact
only
about
five
weeks
peter
spillikins
and
everleigh
were
married
in
asaph
church
on
plutoria
avenue
and
the
wedding
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
sumptuous
of
the
weddings
of
the
september
season
there
were
flowers
and
bridesmaids
in
long
veils
and
tall
ushers
in
and
awnings
at
the
church
door
and
strings
of
motors
with
on
imported
chauffeurs
and
all
that
goes
to
invest
marriage
on
plutoria
avenue
with
its
peculiar
sacredness
the
face
of
the
young
rector
fareforth
furlong
wore
the
added
saintliness
that
springs
from
a
dollar
fee
the
whole
town
was
there
or
at
least
everybody
that
was
anybody
and
if
there
was
one
person
absent
one
who
sat
by
herself
in
the
darkened
of
a
dull
little
house
on
a
shabby
street
who
knew
or
cared
so
after
the
ceremony
the
happy
couple
for
were
they
not
so
left
for
new
york
there
they
spent
their
honeymoon
they
had
thought
of
going
it
was
spillikins
idea
to
the
coast
of
maine
but
said
that
new
york
was
much
nicer
so
restful
whereas
as
everyone
knows
the
coast
of
maine
is
frightfully
noisy
moreover
it
so
happened
that
before
the
had
been
more
than
four
or
five
days
in
new
york
the
ship
of
captain
cormorant
dropped
anchor
in
the
hudson
and
when
the
anchor
of
that
ship
was
once
down
it
generally
stayed
there
so
the
captain
was
able
to
take
the
about
in
new
york
and
to
give
a
tea
for
on
the
deck
of
his
vessel
so
that
she
might
meet
the
officers
and
another
tea
in
a
private
room
of
a
restaurant
on
fifth
avenue
so
that
she
might
meet
no
one
but
himself
and
at
this
tea
captain
cormorant
said
among
other
things
did
he
kick
up
rough
at
all
when
you
told
him
about
the
money
and
everleigh
now
said
not
he
i
think
he
is
actually
pleased
to
know
that
i
have
any
do
you
know
arthur
he
really
an
awfully
good
fellow
and
as
she
said
it
she
moved
her
hand
away
from
under
captain
cormorant
on
the
i
say
said
the
captain
do
get
sentimental
over
him
so
that
is
how
it
is
that
the
came
to
reside
on
plutoria
avenue
in
a
beautiful
stone
house
with
a
in
an
extension
on
the
second
floor
through
the
windows
of
it
one
can
almost
hear
the
click
of
the
billiard
balls
and
a
voice
saying
hold
on
father
you
had
your
shot
chapter
six
the
rival
churches
of
asaph
and
osoph
the
church
of
asaph
more
properly
call
asaph
in
the
fields
stands
among
the
elm
trees
of
plutoria
avenue
opposite
the
university
its
tall
spire
pointing
to
the
blue
sky
its
rector
is
fond
of
saying
that
it
seems
to
him
to
point
as
it
were
a
warning
against
the
sins
of
a
commercial
age
more
particularly
does
he
say
this
in
his
lenten
services
at
noonday
when
the
businessmen
sit
in
front
of
him
in
rows
their
bald
heads
uncovered
and
their
faces
stamped
with
contrition
as
they
think
of
mergers
that
they
should
have
made
and
real
estate
that
they
failed
to
buy
for
lack
of
faith
the
ground
on
which
asaph
stands
is
worth
seven
dollars
and
a
half
a
foot
the
mortgagees
as
they
kneel
in
prayer
in
their
long
feel
that
they
have
built
upon
a
rock
it
is
a
beautifully
appointed
church
there
are
windows
with
priceless
stained
glass
that
were
imported
from
normandy
the
rector
himself
swearing
out
the
invoices
to
save
the
congregation
the
grievous
burden
of
the
customs
duty
there
is
a
pipe
organ
in
the
transept
that
cost
ten
thousand
dollars
to
install
the
as
they
join
in
the
morning
anthem
love
to
hear
the
dulcet
notes
of
the
great
organ
and
to
reflect
that
it
is
as
good
as
new
just
behind
the
church
is
asaph
sunday
school
with
a
dollar
mortgage
of
its
own
and
below
that
again
on
the
side
street
is
the
building
of
the
young
men
guild
with
a
and
a
deep
enough
to
drown
two
young
men
at
a
time
and
a
with
seven
tables
it
is
the
boast
that
with
a
guild
house
such
as
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
young
man
of
the
congregation
to
frequent
a
saloon
nor
is
there
and
on
sunday
mornings
when
the
great
organ
plays
and
the
mortgagees
and
the
and
the
and
the
sunday
school
teachers
and
the
all
lift
up
their
voices
together
there
is
emitted
from
asaph
a
volume
of
praise
that
is
practically
as
fine
and
effective
as
paid
professional
work
asaph
is
episcopal
as
a
consequence
it
has
in
it
and
about
it
all
those
things
which
go
to
make
up
the
episcopal
church
brass
tablets
let
into
its
walls
blackbirds
singing
in
its

parishioners
who
dine
at
eight
and
a
rector
who
wears
a
little
crucifix
and
dances
the
tango
on
the
other
hand
there
stands
upon
the
same
street
not
a
hundred
yards
away
the
rival
church
of
osoph
presbyterian
down
to
its
very
foundations
in
thirty
feet
below
the
level
of
the
avenue
it
has
a
short
squat
tower
and
a
low
roof
and
its
narrow
windows
are
glazed
with
frosted
glass
it
has
dark
spruce
trees
instead
of
elms
crows
instead
of
blackbirds
and
a
gloomy
minister
with
a
shovel
hat
who
lectures
on
philosophy
on
at
the
university
he
loves
to
think
that
his
congregation
are
made
of
the
lowly
and
the
meek
in
spirit
and
to
reflect
that
lowly
and
meek
as
they
are
there
are
men
among
them
that
could
buy
out
half
the
congregation
of
asaph
osoph
is
only
presbyterian
in
a
special
sense
it
is
in
fact
too
presbyterian
to
be
any
longer
connected
with
any
other
body
whatsoever
it
seceded
some
forty
years
ago
from
the
original
body
to
which
it
belonged
and
later
on
with
three
other
churches
it
seceded
from
the
group
of
seceding
congregations
still
later
it
fell
into
a
difference
with
the
three
other
churches
on
the
question
of
eternal
punishment
the
word
eternal
not
appearing
to
the
elders
of
osoph
to
designate
a
sufficiently
long
period
the
dispute
ended
in
a
secession
which
left
the
church
of
osoph
practically
isolated
in
a
world
of
sin
whose
approaching
fate
it
neither
denied
nor
deplored
in
one
respect
the
rival
churches
of
plutoria
avenue
had
had
a
similar
history
each
of
them
had
moved
up
by
successive
stages
from
the
lower
and
poorer
parts
of
the
city
forty
years
ago
asaph
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
little
frame
church
with
a
tin
spire
away
in
the
west
of
the
slums
and
osoph
a
square
diminutive
building
away
in
the
east
but
the
site
of
asaph
had
been
bought
by
a
brewing
company
and
the
trustees
shrewd
men
of
business
themselves
rising
into
wealth
had
rebuilt
it
right
in
the
track
of
the
advancing
tide
of
a
real
estate
boom
the
elders
of
osoph
quiet
men
but
illumined
by
an
inner
light
had
followed
suit
and
moved
their
church
right
against
the
side
of
an
expanding
distillery
thus
both
the
churches
as
decade
followed
decade
made
their
way
up
the
slope
of
the
city
till
asaph
was
presently
gloriously
expropriated
by
the
street
railway
company
and
planted
its
spire
in
triumph
on
plutoria
avenue
itself
but
osoph
followed
with
each
change
of
site
it
moved
nearer
and
nearer
to
asaph
its
elders
were
shrewd
men
with
each
move
of
their
church
they
took
careful
thought
in
the
rebuilding
in
the
manufacturing
district
it
was
built
with
sixteen
windows
on
each
side
and
was
converted
at
a
huge
profit
into
a
bicycle
factory
on
the
residential
street
it
was
made
long
and
deep
and
was
sold
to
a
company
without
the
alteration
of
so
much
as
a
pew
as
a
last
step
a
syndicate
formed
among
the
members
of
the
congregation
themselves
bought
ground
on
plutoria
avenue
and
sublet
it
to
themselves
as
a
site
for
the
church
at
a
nominal
interest
of
five
per
cent
per
annum
payable
nominally
every
three
months
and
secured
by
a
nominal
mortgage
as
the
two
churches
moved
their
congregations
or
at
least
all
that
was
best
of
them
such
members
as
were
sharing
in
the
rising
fortunes
of
the
city
moved
also
and
now
for
some
six
or
seven
years
the
two
churches
and
the
two
congregations
had
confronted
one
another
among
the
elm
trees
of
the
avenue
opposite
to
the
university
but
at
this
point
the
fortunes
of
the
churches
had
diverged
asaph
was
a
brilliant
success
osoph
was
a
failure
even
its
own
trustees
could
deny
it
at
a
time
when
asaph
was
not
only
paying
its
interest
but
showing
a
handsome
surplus
on
everything
it
undertook
the
church
of
osoph
was
moving
steadily
backwards
there
was
no
doubt
of
course
as
to
the
cause
everybody
knew
it
it
was
simply
a
question
of
men
and
as
everybody
said
one
had
only
to
compare
the
two
men
conducting
the
churches
to
see
why
one
succeeded
and
the
other
failed
the
reverend
edward
fareforth
furlong
of
asaph
was
a
man
who
threw
his
whole
energy
into
his
parish
work
the
subtleties
of
theological
controversy
he
left
to
minds
less
active
than
his
own
his
creed
was
one
of
works
rather
than
of
words
and
whatever
he
was
doing
he
did
it
with
his
whole
heart
whether
he
was
lunching
at
the
mausoleum
club
with
one
of
his
church
wardens
or
playing
the
flute
which
he
played
as
only
the
episcopal
clergy
can
play
it
accompanied
on
the
harp
by
one
of
the
fairest
of
the
ladies
of
his
choir
or
whether
he
was
dancing
the
new
episcopal
tango
with
the
younger
daughters
of
the
elder
parishioners
he
threw
himself
into
it
with
all
his
might
he
could
drink
tea
more
gracefully
and
play
tennis
better
than
any
clergyman
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
he
could
stand
beside
the
white
stone
font
of
asaph
in
his
long
white
surplice
holding
a
infant
worth
half
a
million
dollars
looking
as
beautifully
innocent
as
the
child
itself
and
drawing
from
every
matron
of
the
congregation
with
unmarried
daughters
the
despairing
cry
what
a
pity
that
he
has
no
children
of
his
own
equally
sound
was
his
theology
no
man
was
known
to
preach
shorter
sermons
or
to
explain
away
the
book
of
genesis
more
agreeably
than
the
rector
of
asaph
and
if
he
found
it
necessary
to
refer
to
the
deity
he
did
so
under
the
name
of
jehovah
or
jah
or
even
yaweh
in
a
manner
calculated
not
to
hurt
the
sensitiveness
of
any
of
the
parishioners
people
who
would
shudder
at
brutal
talk
of
the
older
fashion
about
the
wrath
of
god
listened
with
interest
to
a
sermon
on
the
personal
characteristics
of
jah
in
the
same
way
furlong
always
referred
to
the
devil
not
as
satan
but
as
su
or
swa
which
took
all
the
sting
out
of
him
beelzebub
he
spoke
of
as
which
rendered
him
perfectly
harmless
the
garden
of
eden
he
spoke
of
as
the
paradeisos
which
explained
it
entirely
the
flood
as
the
diluvium
which
cleared
it
up
completely
and
jonah
he
named
after
the
correct
fashion
jon
nah
which
put
the
whole
situation
his
being
swallowed
by
baloo
or
the
great
lizard
on
a
perfectly
satisfactory
footing
hell
itself
was
spoken
of
as
and
it
appeared
that
it
was
not
a
place
of
burning
but
rather
of
what
one
might
describe
as
moral
torment
this
settled
once
and
for
all
nobody
minds
moral
torment
in
short
there
was
nothing
in
the
theological
system
of
furlong
that
need
have
occasioned
in
any
of
his
congregation
a
moment
discomfort
there
could
be
no
greater
contrast
with
fareforth
furlong
than
the
minister
of
osoph
the
rev
mcteague
who
was
also
honorary
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
university
the
one
was
young
the
other
was
old
the
one
could
dance
the
other
could
not
the
one
moved
about
at
church
picnics
and
lawn
teas
among
a
bevy
of
disciples
in
pink
and
blue
sashes
the
other
moped
around
under
the
trees
of
the
university
campus
with
blinking
eyes
that
saw
nothing
and
an
abstracted
mind
that
had
spent
fifty
years
in
trying
to
reconcile
hegel
with
paul
and
was
still
busy
with
it
furlong
went
forward
with
the
times
mcteague
slid
quietly
backwards
with
the
centuries
mcteague
was
a
failure
and
all
his
congregation
knew
it
he
is
not
up
to
date
they
said
that
was
his
crowning
sin
he
do
go
forward
any
said
the
business
members
of
the
congregation
that
old
man
believes
just
exactly
the
same
sort
of
stuff
now
that
he
did
forty
years
ago
what
more
he
preaches
it
you
ca
run
a
church
that
way
can
you
his
trustees
had
done
their
best
to
meet
the
difficulty
they
had
offered
mcteague
a
vacation
to
go
and
see
the
holy
land
he
refused
he
said
he
could
picture
it
they
reduced
his
salary
by
fifty
per
cent
he
never
noticed
it
they
offered
him
an
assistant
but
he
shook
his
head
saying
that
he
did
know
where
he
could
find
a
man
to
do
just
the
work
that
he
was
doing
meantime
he
mooned
about
among
the
trees
concocting
a
mixture
of
paul
with
hegel
three
parts
to
one
for
his
sunday
sermon
and
one
part
to
three
for
his
monday
lecture
no
doubt
it
was
his
dual
function
that
was
to
blame
for
his
failure
and
this
perhaps
was
the
fault
of
boomer
the
president
of
the
university
boomer
like
all
university
presidents
of
today
belonged
to
the
presbyterian
church
or
rather
to
state
it
more
correctly
he
included
presbyterianism
within
himself
he
was
of
course
a
member
of
the
board
of
management
of
osoph
and
it
was
he
who
had
urged
very
strongly
the
appointment
of
mcteague
then
senior
professor
of
philosophy
as
minister
a
saintly
man
he
said
the
very
man
for
the
post
if
you
should
ask
me
whether
he
is
entirely
at
home
as
a
professor
of
philosophy
on
our
staff
at
the
university
i
should
be
compelled
to
say
no
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
as
a
lecturer
he
does
not
meet
our
views
he
appears
to
find
it
difficult
to
keep
religion
out
of
his
teaching
in
fact
his
lectures
are
suffused
with
a
rather
dangerous
attempt
at
moral
teaching
which
is
apt
to
contaminate
our
students
but
in
the
church
i
should
imagine
that
would
be
if
anything
an
advantage
indeed
if
you
were
to
come
to
me
and
say
we
wish
to
appoint
mcteague
as
our
minister
i
should
say
quite
frankly
him
so
mcteague
had
been
appointed
then
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
he
refused
to
give
up
his
lectures
in
philosophy
he
said
he
felt
a
call
to
give
them
the
salary
he
said
was
of
no
consequence
he
wrote
to
furlong
senior
the
father
of
the
episcopal
rector
and
honorary
treasurer
of
the
plutoria
university
and
stated
that
he
proposed
to
give
his
lectures
for
nothing
the
trustees
of
the
college
protested
they
urged
that
the
case
might
set
a
dangerous
precedent
which
other
professors
might
follow
while
fully
admitting
that
lectures
were
well
worth
giving
for
nothing
they
begged
him
to
reconsider
his
offer
but
he
refused
and
from
that
day
on
in
spite
of
all
offers
that
he
should
retire
on
double
his
salary
that
he
should
visit
the
holy
land
or
syria
or
armenia
where
the
dreadful
massacres
of
christians
were
taking
place
mcteague
clung
to
his
post
with
a
tenacity
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
scotland
his
only
internal
perplexity
was
that
he
did
see
how
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
die
twenty
or
thirty
years
hence
they
would
ever
be
able
to
replace
him
such
was
the
situation
of
the
two
churches
on
a
certain
beautiful
morning
in
june
when
an
unforeseen
event
altered
entirely
the
current
of
their
fortunes
no
thank
you
juliana
said
the
young
rector
to
his
sister
across
the
breakfast
table
and
there
was
something
as
near
to
bitterness
in
his
look
as
his
saintly
face
was
capable
of
reflecting
no
thank
you
no
more
porridge
prunes
no
no
thank
you
i
do
think
i
care
for
any
and
by
the
way
he
added
bother
to
keep
any
lunch
for
me
i
have
a
great
deal
of
business
that
is
of
work
in
the
parish
to
see
to
and
i
must
just
find
time
to
get
a
bite
of
something
to
eat
when
and
where
i
can
in
his
own
mind
he
was
resolving
that
the
place
should
be
the
mausoleum
club
and
the
time
just
as
soon
as
the
head
waiter
would
serve
him
after
which
the
reverend
edward
fareforth
furlong
bowed
his
head
for
a
moment
in
a
short
silent
blessing
the
one
prescribed
by
the
episcopal
church
in
america
for
a
breakfast
of
porridge
and
prunes
it
was
their
first
breakfast
together
and
it
spoke
volumes
to
the
rector
he
knew
what
it
implied
it
stood
for
his
elder
sister
juliana
views
on
the
need
of
personal
sacrifice
as
a
means
of
grace
the
rector
sighed
as
he
rose
he
had
never
missed
his
younger
sister
philippa
now
married
and
departed
so
keenly
philippa
had
had
opinions
of
her
own
on
bacon
and
eggs
and
on
lamb
chops
with
watercress
as
a
means
of
stimulating
the
soul
but
juliana
was
different
the
rector
understood
now
exactly
why
it
was
that
his
father
had
exclaimed
on
the
news
of
philippa
engagement
without
a
second
hesitation
then
of
course
juliana
must
live
with
you
nonsense
my
dear
boy
nonsense
it
my
duty
to
spare
her
to
you
after
all
i
can
always
eat
at
the
club
they
can
give
me
a
bite
of
something
or
other
surely
to
a
man
of
my
age
edward
food
is
really
of
no
consequence
no
no
juliana
must
move
into
the
rectory
at
once
the
rector
elder
sister
rose
she
looked
tall
and
sallow
and
forbidding
in
the
plain
black
dress
that
contrasted
sadly
with
the
charming
clerical
costumes
of
white
and
pink
and
the
broad
episcopal
hats
with
flowers
in
them
that
philippa
used
to
wear
for
morning
work
in
the
parish
for
what
time
shall
i
order
dinner
she
asked
you
and
philippa
used
to
have
it
at
seven
did
you
not
do
you
think
that
rather
too
late
a
trifle
perhaps
said
the
rector
uneasily
he
did
care
to
explain
to
juliana
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
home
any
earlier
from
the
kind
of
that
everybody
was
giving
just
now
but
do
trouble
about
dinner
i
may
be
working
very
late
if
i
need
anything
to
eat
i
shall
get
a
biscuit
and
some
tea
at
the
guild
rooms
or
he
did
finish
the
sentence
but
in
his
mind
he
added
or
else
a
really
dinner
at
the
mausoleum
club
or
at
the
or
the
anywhere
except
here
if
you
are
going
then
said
juliana
may
i
have
the
key
of
the
church
a
look
of
pain
passed
over
the
rector
face
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
juliana
wanted
the
key
for
she
meant
to
go
into
his
church
and
pray
in
it
the
rector
of
asaph
was
he
trusted
as
a
man
as
an
anglican
clergyman
ought
to
be
he
had
no
objection
to
any
reasonable
use
of
his
church
for
a
thanksgiving
festival
or
for
musical
recitals
for
example
but
when
it
came
to
opening
up
the
church
and
using
it
to
pray
in
the
thing
was
going
a
little
too
far
what
was
more
he
had
an
idea
from
the
look
on
juliana
face
that
she
meant
to
pray
for
this
for
a
clergy
man
was
hard
to
bear
philippa
like
the
good
girl
that
she
was
had
prayed
only
for
herself
and
then
only
at
the
proper
times
and
places
and
in
a
proper
praying
costume
the
rector
began
to
realize
what
difficulties
it
might
make
for
a
clergyman
to
have
a
religious
sister
as
his
but
he
was
never
a
man
for
unseemly
argument
it
is
hanging
in
my
study
he
said
and
with
that
the
rev
fareforth
furlong
passed
into
the
hall
took
up
the
simple
silk
hat
the
stick
and
gloves
of
the
working
clergyman
and
walked
out
on
to
the
avenue
to
begin
his
day
work
in
the
parish
the
rector
parish
viewed
in
its
earthly
aspect
was
a
singularly
beautiful
place
for
it
extended
all
along
plutoria
avenue
where
the
street
is
widest
and
the
elm
trees
are
at
their
leafiest
and
the
motors
at
their
very
drowsiest
it
lay
up
and
down
the
shaded
side
streets
of
the
residential
district
darkened
with
great
chestnuts
and
hushed
in
a
stillness
that
was
almost
religion
itself
there
was
not
a
house
in
the
parish
assessed
at
less
than
thousand
and
in
very
heart
of
it
the
mausoleum
club
with
its
smooth
white
stone
and
its
grecian
architecture
carried
one
back
to
the
ancient
world
and
made
one
think
of
athens
and
of
paul
preaching
on
mars
hill
it
was
all
considered
a
splendid
thing
to
fight
sin
in
such
a
parish
and
to
keep
it
out
of
it
for
kept
out
it
was
one
might
look
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
broad
avenue
and
see
no
sign
of
sin
all
along
it
there
was
certainly
none
in
the
smooth
faces
of
the
chauffeurs
trundling
their
drowsy
motors
no
sign
of
it
in
the
expensive
children
paraded
by
imported
nursemaids
in
the
chequered
light
of
the
shaded
street
least
of
all
was
there
any
sign
of
it
in
the
stock
exchange
members
of
the
congregation
as
they
walked
along
side
by
side
to
their
lunch
at
the
mausoleum
club
their
silk
hats
nodding
together
in
earnest
colloquy
on
shares
preferred
and
profits
undivided
so
might
have
walked
so
must
have
walked
the
very
fathers
of
the
church
themselves
whatever
sin
there
was
in
the
city
was
shoved
sideways
into
the
roaring
streets
of
commerce
where
the
elevated
railway
ran
and
below
that
again
into
the
slums
here
there
must
have
been
any
quantity
of
sin
the
rector
of
asaph
was
certain
of
it
many
of
the
richer
of
his
parishioners
had
been
down
in
parties
late
at
night
to
look
at
it
and
the
ladies
of
his
congregation
were
joined
together
into
all
sorts
of
guilds
and
societies
and
bands
of
endeavour
for
stamping
it
out
and
driving
it
under
or
putting
it
into
jail
till
it
surrendered
but
the
slums
lay
outside
the
rector
parish
he
had
no
right
to
interfere
they
were
under
the
charge
of
a
special
mission
or
auxiliary
a
remnant
of
the
asaph
of
the
past
placed
under
the
care
of
a
divinity
student
at
four
hundred
dollars
per
annum
his
charge
included
all
the
slums
and
three
police
courts
and
two
music
halls
and
the
city
jail
one
sunday
afternoon
in
every
three
months
the
rector
and
several
ladies
went
down
and
sang
hymns
for
him
in
his
but
his
work
was
really
very
easy
a
funeral
for
example
at
the
mission
was
a
simple
affair
meaning
nothing
more
than
the
preparation
of
a
plain
coffin
and
a
glassless
hearse
and
the
distribution
of
a
few
artificial
everlasting
flowers
to
women
crying
in
their
aprons
a
thing
easily
done
whereas
in
asaph
parish
where
all
the
really
important
souls
were
a
funeral
was
a
large
event
requiring
taste
and
tact
and
a
nice
shading
of
delicacy
in
distinguishing
mourners
from
beneficiaries
and
private
grief
from
business
representation
at
the
ceremony
a
funeral
with
a
plain
coffin
and
a
hearse
was
as
nothing
beside
an
interment
with
a
casket
smothered
in
syringas
borne
in
a
coach
and
followed
by
special
reporters
from
the
financial
papers
it
appeared
to
the
rector
afterwards
as
almost
a
shocking
coincidence
that
the
first
person
whom
he
met
upon
the
avenue
should
have
been
the
rev
mcteague
himself
furlong
gave
him
the
form
of
amiable
good
morning
that
the
episcopal
church
always
extends
to
those
in
error
but
he
did
not
hear
it
the
minister
head
was
bent
low
his
eyes
gazed
into
vacancy
and
from
the
movements
of
his
lips
and
from
the
fact
that
he
carried
a
leather
case
of
notes
he
was
plainly
on
his
way
to
his
philosophical
lecture
but
the
rector
had
no
time
to
muse
upon
the
abstracted
appearance
of
his
rival
for
as
always
happened
to
him
he
was
no
sooner
upon
the
street
than
his
parish
work
of
the
day
began
in
fact
he
had
hardly
taken
a
dozen
steps
after
passing
mcteague
when
he
was
brought
up
standing
by
two
beautiful
parishioners
with
pink
parasols
oh
furlong
exclaimed
one
of
them
so
fortunate
to
happen
to
catch
you
we
were
just
going
into
the
rectory
to
consult
you
should
the
girls
for
the
lawn
tea
for
the
guild
on
friday
you
know
wear
white
dresses
with
light
blue
sashes
all
the
same
or
do
you
think
we
might
allow
them
to
wear
any
coloured
sashes
that
they
like
what
do
you
think
this
was
an
important
problem
in
fact
there
was
a
piece
of
parish
work
here
that
it
took
the
reverend
fareforth
half
an
hour
to
attend
to
standing
the
while
in
earnest
colloquy
with
the
two
ladies
under
the
shadow
of
the
elm
trees
but
a
clergyman
must
never
be
grudging
of
his
time
goodbye
then
they
said
at
last
are
you
coming
to
the
browning
club
this
morning
oh
so
sorry
but
we
shall
see
you
at
the
musicale
this
afternoon
shall
we
not
oh
i
trust
so
said
the
rector
how
dreadfully
hard
he
works
said
the
ladies
to
one
another
as
they
moved
away
thus
slowly
and
with
many
interruptions
the
rector
made
his
progress
along
the
avenue
at
times
he
stopped
to
permit
a
infant
in
a
perambulator
to
beat
him
with
a
rattle
while
he
inquired
its
age
of
an
episcopal
nurse
gay
with
flowing
ribbons
he
lifted
his
hat
to
the
bright
parasols
of
his
parishioners
passing
in
glistening
motors
bowed
to
episcopalians
nodded
amiably
to
presbyterians
and
even
acknowledged
with
his
lifted
hat
the
passing
of
persons
of
graver
forms
of
error
thus
he
took
his
way
along
the
avenue
and
down
a
side
street
towards
the
business
district
of
the
city
until
just
at
the
edge
of
it
where
the
trees
were
about
to
stop
and
the
shops
were
about
to
begin
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
the
hymnal
supply
corporation
limited
the
premises
as
seen
from
the
outside
combined
the
idea
of
an
office
with
an
ecclesiastical
appearance
the
door
was
as
that
of
a
chancel
or
vestry
there
was
a
large
window
filled
with
bibles
and
testaments
all
spread
open
and
showing
every
variety
of
language
in
their
pages
these
were
marked
arabic
syriac
coptic
ojibway
irish
and
so
forth
on
the
window
in
small
white
lettering
were
the
words
hymnal
supply
corporation
and
below
that
hosanna
pipe
and
steam
organ
incorporated
and
still
lower
the
legend
bible
society
of
the
good
shepherd
limited
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
sacred
character
of
the
place
here
laboured
furlong
senior
the
father
of
the
rev
edward
fareforth
he
was
a
man
of
many
activities
president
and
managing
director
of
the
companies
just
mentioned
trustee
and
secretary
of
asaph
honorary
treasurer
of
the
university
etc
and
each
of
his
occupations
and
offices
was
marked
by
something
of
a
supramundane
character
something
higher
than
ordinary
business
his
different
official
positions
naturally
overlapped
and
brought
him
into
contact
with
himself
from
a
variety
of
angles
thus
he
sold
himself
hymn
books
at
a
price
per
thousand
made
as
a
business
favour
to
himself
negotiated
with
himself
the
purchase
of
the
organ
making
a
price
on
it
to
himself
that
he
begged
himself
to
regard
as
confidential
and
as
treasurer
of
the
college
he
sent
himself
an
informal
note
of
enquiry
asking
if
he
knew
of
any
sound
investment
for
the
annual
deficit
of
the
college
funds
a
matter
of
some
sixty
thousand
dollars
a
year
which
needed
very
careful
handling
any
man
and
there
are
many
such
who
has
been
concerned
with
business
dealings
of
this
sort
with
himself
realizes
that
they
are
more
satisfactory
than
any
other
kind
to
what
better
person
then
could
the
rector
of
asaph
bring
the
quarterly
accounts
and
statements
of
his
church
than
to
furlong
senior
the
outer
door
was
opened
to
the
rector
by
a
sanctified
boy
with
such
a
face
as
is
only
found
in
the
choirs
of
the
episcopal
church
in
an
outer
office
through
which
the
rector
passed
were
two
sacred
stenographers
with
hair
as
golden
as
the
daffodils
of
sheba
copying
confidential
letters
on
absolutely
noiseless
typewriters
they
were
making
offers
of
bibles
in
lots
at
two
and
a
half
per
cent
reduction
offering
to
reduce
mark
by
two
cents
on
condition
of
immediate
export
and
to
lay
down
john
san
francisco
for
seven
cents
while
regretting
that
they
could
deliver
fifteen
thousand
rock
of
ages
in
missouri
on
no
other
terms
than
cash
the
sacred
character
of
their
work
lent
them
a
preoccupation
beautiful
to
behold
in
the
room
beyond
them
was
a
confidential
clerk
venerable
as
the
song
of
solomon
and
by
him
fareforth
furlong
was
duly
shown
into
the
office
of
his
father
good
morning
edward
said
furlong
senior
as
he
shook
hands
i
was
expecting
you
and
while
i
think
of
it
i
have
just
had
a
letter
from
philippa
she
and
tom
will
be
home
in
two
or
three
weeks
she
writes
from
egypt
she
wishes
me
to
tell
you
as
no
doubt
you
have
already
anticipated
that
she
thinks
she
can
hardly
continue
to
be
a
member
of
the
congregation
when
they
come
back
no
doubt
you
felt
this
yourself
oh
entirely
said
the
rector
surely
in
matters
of
belief
a
wife
must
follow
her
husband
exactly
especially
as
tom
uncles
occupy
the
position
they
do
with
regard
to
furlong
jerked
his
head
backwards
and
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
a
way
that
his
son
knew
was
meant
to
indicate
osoph
church
the
overend
brothers
who
were
tom
uncles
his
name
being
tom
overend
were
as
everybody
knew
among
the
principal
supporters
of
osoph
not
that
they
were
by
origin
presbyterians
but
they
were
men
which
put
them
once
and
for
all
out
of
sympathy
with
such
a
place
as
asaph
we
made
ourselves
the
two
brothers
used
to
repeat
in
defiance
of
the
catechism
of
the
anglican
church
they
never
wearied
of
explaining
how
dick
the
senior
brother
had
worked
overtime
by
day
to
send
george
the
junior
brother
to
school
by
night
and
how
george
had
then
worked
overtime
by
night
to
send
dick
to
school
by
day
thus
they
had
come
up
the
business
ladder
hand
over
hand
landing
later
on
in
life
on
the
platform
of
success
like
two
corpulent
acrobats
panting
with
the
strain
of
it
for
years
george
would
explain
we
had
father
and
mother
to
keep
as
well
then
they
died
and
dick
and
me
saw
daylight
by
which
he
meant
no
harm
at
all
but
only
stated
a
fact
and
concealed
the
virtue
of
it
and
being
men
they
made
it
a
point
to
do
what
they
could
to
lessen
the
importance
of
such
an
institution
as
asaph
church
by
the
same
contrariety
of
nature
the
two
overend
brothers
their
business
name
was
overend
brothers
limited
were
supporters
of
the
dissentient
young
men
guild
and
the
second
or
rival
university
settlement
and
of
anything
or
everything
that
showed
a
likelihood
of
making
trouble
on
this
principle
they
were
warm
supporters
and
friends
of
the
rev
mcteague
the
minister
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
present
to
the
brothers
a
copy
of
his
philosophical
work
mcteague
exposition
of
the
kantian
hypothesis
and
the
two
brothers
had
read
it
through
in
the
office
devoting
each
of
them
a
whole
morning
to
it
dick
the
senior
brother
had
said
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
george
the
junior
had
declared
that
a
man
who
could
write
that
was
capable
of
anything
on
the
whole
it
was
evident
that
the
relations
between
the
overend
family
and
the
presbyterian
religion
were
too
intimate
to
allow
tom
overend
formerly
miss
philippa
furlong
to
sit
anywhere
else
of
a
sunday
than
under
mcteague
philippa
writes
continued
furlong
that
under
the
circumstances
she
and
tom
would
like
to
do
something
for
your
church
she
would
like
yes
i
have
the
letter
here
to
give
you
as
a
surprise
of
course
either
a
new
font
or
a
carved
pulpit
or
perhaps
a
cheque
she
wishes
me
on
no
account
to
mention
it
to
you
directly
but
to
ascertain
indirectly
from
you
what
would
be
the
better
surprise
oh
a
cheque
i
think
said
the
rector
one
can
do
so
much
more
with
it
after
all
precisely
said
his
father
he
was
well
aware
of
many
things
that
can
be
done
with
a
cheque
that
can
not
possibly
be
done
with
a
font
that
settled
then
resumed
furlong
and
now
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
run
my
eye
over
your
quarterly
statements
do
you
not
before
we
send
them
in
to
the
trustees
that
is
what
you
come
for
is
it
not
yes
said
the
rector
drawing
a
bundle
of
blue
and
white
papers
from
his
pocket
i
have
everything
with
me
our
showing
is
i
believe
excellent
though
i
fear
i
fail
to
present
it
as
clearly
as
it
might
be
done
furlong
senior
spread
the
papers
on
the
table
before
him
and
adjusted
his
spectacles
to
a
more
convenient
angle
he
smiled
indulgently
as
he
looked
at
the
documents
before
him
i
am
afraid
you
would
never
make
an
accountant
edward
he
said
i
fear
not
said
the
rector
your
items
said
his
father
are
entered
wrongly
here
for
example
in
the
general
statement
you
put
down
distribution
of
coals
to
the
poor
to
your
credit
in
the
same
way
bibles
and
prizes
to
the
sunday
school
you
again
mark
to
your
credit
why
do
you
see
my
boy
that
these
things
are
debits
when
you
give
out
bibles
or
distribute
fuel
to
the
poor
you
give
out
something
for
which
you
get
no
return
it
is
a
debit
on
the
other
hand
such
items
as
church
offertory
pennies
are
pure
profit
surely
the
principle
is
clear
i
think
i
see
it
better
now
said
the
rev
edward
perfectly
plain
is
it
his
father
went
on
and
here
again
paupers
burial
fund
a
loss
enter
it
as
such
christmas
gift
to
verger
and
sexton
an
absolute
loss
you
get
nothing
in
return
mite
fines
inflicted
in
sunday
school
these
are
profit
write
them
down
as
such
by
this
method
you
see
in
ordinary
business
we
can
tell
exactly
where
we
stand
anything
which
we
give
out
without
return
or
reward
we
count
as
a
debit
all
that
we
take
from
others
without
giving
in
return
we
count
as
so
much
to
our
credit
ah
yes
murmured
the
rector
i
begin
to
understand
very
good
but
after
all
edward
i
must
quarrel
with
the
mere
form
of
your
accounts
the
statement
is
really
a
splendid
showing
i
see
that
not
only
is
our
mortgage
and
debenture
interest
all
paid
to
date
but
that
a
number
of
our
enterprises
are
making
a
handsome
return
i
notice
for
example
that
the
girls
friendly
society
of
the
church
not
only
pays
for
itself
but
that
you
are
able
to
take
something
out
of
its
funds
and
transfer
it
to
the
men
book
club
excellent
and
i
observe
that
you
have
been
able
to
take
a
large
portion
of
the
soup
kitchen
fund
and
put
it
into
the
rector
picnic
account
very
good
indeed
in
this
respect
your
figures
are
a
model
for
church
accounts
anywhere
furlong
continued
his
scrutiny
of
the
accounts
excellent
he
murmured
and
on
the
whole
an
annual
surplus
i
see
of
several
thousands
but
stop
a
bit
he
continued
checking
himself
this
are
you
aware
edward
that
you
are
losing
money
on
your
foreign
missions
account
i
feared
as
much
said
edward
it
incontestable
look
at
the
figures
for
yourself
salary
so
much
clothes
and
books
to
converts
so
much
voluntary
and
other
offerings
of
converts
so
much
why
you
losing
on
it
edward
exclaimed
furlong
and
he
shook
his
head
dubiously
at
the
accounts
before
him
i
thought
protested
his
son
that
in
view
of
the
character
of
the
work
itself
quite
so
answered
his
father
quite
so
i
fully
admit
the
force
of
that
i
am
only
asking
you
is
it
worth
it
mind
you
i
am
not
speaking
now
as
a
christian
but
as
a
businessman
is
it
worth
it
i
thought
that
perhaps
in
view
of
the
fact
of
our
large
surplus
in
other
directions
exactly
said
his
father
a
heavy
surplus
it
is
precisely
on
that
point
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
this
morning
you
have
at
present
a
large
annual
surplus
and
there
is
every
prospect
under
providence
in
fact
i
think
in
any
case
of
it
continuing
for
years
to
come
if
i
may
speak
very
frankly
i
should
say
that
as
long
as
our
reverend
friend
mcteague
continues
in
his
charge
of
osoph
and
i
trust
that
he
may
be
spared
for
many
years
to
come
you
are
likely
to
enjoy
the
present
prosperity
of
your
church
very
good
the
question
arises
what
disposition
are
we
to
make
of
our
accumulating
funds
yes
said
the
rector
hesitating
i
am
speaking
to
you
now
said
his
father
not
as
the
secretary
of
your
church
but
as
president
of
the
hymnal
supply
company
which
i
represent
here
now
please
understand
edward
i
do
want
in
any
way
to
force
or
control
your
judgment
i
merely
wish
to
show
you
certain
shall
i
say
certain
opportunities
that
present
themselves
for
the
disposal
of
our
funds
the
matter
can
be
taken
up
later
formally
by
yourself
and
the
trustees
of
the
church
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
already
written
to
myself
as
secretary
in
the
matter
and
i
have
received
what
i
consider
a
quite
encouraging
answer
let
me
explain
what
i
propose
furlong
senior
rose
and
opening
the
door
of
the
office
everett
he
said
to
the
ancient
clerk
kindly
give
me
a
bible
it
was
given
to
him
furlong
stood
with
the
bible
poised
in
his
hand
now
we
he
went
on
i
mean
the
hymnal
supply
corporation
have
an
idea
for
bringing
out
an
entirely
new
bible
a
look
of
dismay
appeared
on
the
saintly
face
of
the
rector
a
new
bible
he
gasped
precisely
said
his
father
a
new
bible
this
one
and
we
find
it
every
day
in
our
business
is
all
wrong
all
wrong
said
the
rector
with
horror
in
his
face
my
dear
boy
exclaimed
his
father
pray
pray
do
not
misunderstand
me
do
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
mean
wrong
in
a
religious
sense
such
a
thought
could
never
i
hope
enter
my
mind
all
that
i
mean
is
that
this
bible
is
badly
made
up
badly
made
up
repeated
his
son
as
mystified
as
ever
i
see
that
you
do
not
understand
me
what
i
mean
is
this
let
me
try
to
make
myself
quite
clear
for
the
market
of
today
this
bible
and
he
poised
it
again
on
his
hand
as
if
to
test
its
weight
is
too
heavy
the
people
of
today
want
something
lighter
something
easier
to
get
hold
of
now
if
but
what
furlong
was
about
to
say
was
lost
forever
to
the
world
for
just
at
this
juncture
something
occurred
calculated
to
divert
not
only
furlong
sentence
but
the
fortunes
and
the
surplus
of
asaph
itself
at
the
very
moment
when
furlong
was
speaking
a
newspaper
delivery
man
in
the
street
outside
handed
to
the
sanctified
boy
the
office
copy
of
the
noonday
paper
and
the
boy
had
no
sooner
looked
at
its
headlines
than
he
said
how
dreadful
being
sanctified
he
had
no
stronger
form
of
speech
than
that
but
he
handed
the
paper
forthwith
to
one
of
the
stenographers
with
hair
like
the
daffodils
of
sheba
and
when
she
looked
at
it
she
exclaimed
how
awful
and
she
knocked
at
once
at
the
door
of
the
ancient
clerk
and
gave
the
paper
to
him
and
when
he
looked
at
it
and
saw
the
headline
the
ancient
clerk
murmured
ah
in
the
gentle
tone
in
which
very
old
people
greet
the
news
of
catastrophe
or
sudden
death
but
in
his
turn
he
opened
furlong
door
and
put
down
the
paper
laying
his
finger
on
the
column
for
a
moment
without
a
word
furlong
stopped
short
in
his
sentence
dear
me
he
said
as
his
eyes
caught
the
item
of
news
how
very
dreadful
what
is
it
said
the
rector
mcteague
answered
his
father
he
has
been
stricken
with
paralysis
how
shocking
said
the
rector
aghast
but
when
i
saw
him
only
this
morning
it
has
just
happened
said
his
father
following
down
the
column
of
the
newspaper
as
he
spoke
this
morning
at
the
university
in
his
classroom
at
a
lecture
dear
me
how
dreadful
i
must
go
and
see
the
president
at
once
furlong
was
about
to
reach
for
his
hat
and
stick
when
at
that
moment
the
aged
clerk
knocked
at
the
door
boomer
he
announced
in
a
tone
of
solemnity
suited
to
the
occasion
boomer
entered
shook
hands
in
silence
and
sat
down
you
have
heard
our
sad
news
i
suppose
he
said
he
used
the
word
our
as
between
the
university
president
and
his
honorary
treasurer
how
did
it
happen
asked
furlong
most
distressing
said
the
president
mcteague
it
seems
had
just
entered
his
ten
class
the
hour
was
about
and
was
about
to
open
his
lecture
when
one
of
his
students
rose
in
his
seat
and
asked
a
question
it
is
a
practice
continued
boomer
which
i
need
hardly
say
we
do
not
encourage
the
young
man
i
believe
was
a
newcomer
in
the
philosophy
class
at
any
rate
he
asked
mcteague
quite
suddenly
it
appears
how
he
could
reconcile
his
theory
of
transcendental
immaterialism
with
a
scheme
of
rigid
moral
determinism
mcteague
stared
for
a
moment
his
mouth
so
the
class
assert
painfully
open
the
student
repeated
the
question
and
poor
mcteague
fell
forward
over
his
desk
paralysed
is
he
dead
gasped
furlong
no
said
the
president
but
we
expect
his
death
at
any
moment
slyder
i
may
say
is
with
him
now
and
is
doing
all
he
can
in
any
case
i
suppose
he
could
hardly
recover
enough
to
continue
his
college
duties
said
the
young
rector
out
of
the
question
said
the
president
i
should
not
like
to
state
that
of
itself
mere
paralysis
need
incapacitate
a
professor
thrum
our
professor
of
the
theory
of
music
is
as
you
know
paralysed
in
his
ears
and
slant
our
professor
of
optics
is
paralysed
in
his
right
eye
but
this
is
a
case
of
paralysis
of
the
brain
i
fear
it
is
incompatible
with
professorial
work
then
i
suppose
said
furlong
senior
we
shall
have
to
think
of
the
question
of
a
successor
they
had
both
thinking
of
it
for
at
least
three
minutes
we
must
said
the
president
for
the
moment
i
feel
too
stunned
by
the
sad
news
to
act
i
have
merely
telegraphed
to
two
or
three
leading
colleges
for
a
and
sent
out
a
few
advertisements
announcing
the
chair
as
vacant
but
it
will
be
difficult
to
replace
mcteague
he
was
a
man
added
boomer
rehearsing
in
advance
unconsciously
no
doubt
his
forthcoming
oration
over
death
of
a
singular
grasp
a
breadth
of
culture
and
he
was
able
as
few
men
are
to
instil
what
i
might
call
a
spirit
of
religion
into
his
teaching
his
lectures
indeed
were
suffused
with
moral
instruction
and
exercised
over
his
students
an
influence
second
only
to
that
of
the
pulpit
itself
he
paused
ah
yes
the
pulpit
said
furlong
there
indeed
you
will
miss
him
that
said
boomer
very
reverently
is
our
real
loss
deep
irreparable
i
suppose
indeed
i
am
certain
we
shall
never
again
see
such
a
man
in
the
pulpit
of
osoph
which
reminds
me
he
added
more
briskly
i
must
ask
the
newspaper
people
to
let
it
be
known
that
there
will
be
service
as
usual
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
that
mcteague
death
will
of
course
make
no
difference
that
is
to
say
i
must
see
the
newspaper
people
at
once
that
afternoon
all
the
newspaper
editors
in
the
city
were
busy
getting
their
obituary
notices
ready
for
the
demise
of
mcteague
the
death
of
mcteague
wrote
the
editor
of
the
and
financial
a
paper
which
had
almost
openly
advocated
the
minister
dismissal
for
five
years
back
comes
upon
us
as
an
irreparable
loss
his
place
will
be
difficult
nay
impossible
to
fill
whether
as
a
philosopher
or
a
divine
he
can
not
be
replaced
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
so
wrote
the
editor
of
the
a
morning
paper
which
was
able
to
take
a
broad
or
point
of
view
of
men
and
things
that
the
loss
of
mcteague
will
be
just
as
much
felt
in
europe
as
in
america
to
germany
the
news
that
the
hand
that
penned
shorter
exposition
of
the
kantian
hypothesis
has
ceased
to
write
will
come
with
the
shock
of
poignant
anguish
while
to
france
the
editor
left
the
article
unfinished
at
that
point
after
all
he
was
a
ready
writer
and
he
reflected
that
there
would
be
time
enough
before
actually
going
to
press
to
consider
from
what
particular
angle
the
blow
of
mcteague
death
would
strike
down
the
people
of
france
so
ran
in
speech
and
in
writing
during
two
or
three
days
the
requiem
of
mcteague
altogether
there
were
more
kind
things
said
of
him
in
the
three
days
during
which
he
was
taken
for
dead
than
in
thirty
years
of
his
life
which
seemed
a
pity
and
after
it
all
at
the
close
of
the
third
day
mcteague
feebly
opened
his
eyes
but
when
he
opened
them
the
world
had
already
passed
on
and
left
him
behind
chapter
seven
the
ministrations
of
the
rev
uttermust
dumfarthing
well
then
gentlemen
i
think
we
have
all
agreed
upon
our
man
dick
overend
looked
around
the
table
as
he
spoke
at
the
managing
trustees
of
osoph
church
they
were
assembled
in
an
upper
committee
room
of
the
mausoleum
club
their
official
place
of
meeting
was
in
a
board
room
off
the
vestry
of
the
church
but
they
had
felt
a
draught
in
it
some
four
years
ago
which
had
wafted
them
over
to
the
club
as
their
place
of
assembly
in
the
club
there
were
no
draughts
dick
overend
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
brother
george
beside
him
and
boomer
at
the
foot
beside
them
were
boulder
skinyer
of
skinyer
and
beatem
and
the
rest
of
the
trustees
you
are
agreed
then
on
the
reverend
uttermust
dumfarthing
quite
agreed
murmured
several
trustees
together
a
most
remarkable
man
said
boomer
i
heard
him
preach
in
his
present
church
he
gave
utterance
to
thoughts
that
i
have
myself
been
thinking
for
years
i
never
listened
to
anything
so
sound
or
so
scholarly
i
heard
him
the
night
he
preached
in
new
york
said
boulder
he
preached
a
sermon
to
the
poor
he
told
them
they
were
no
good
i
never
heard
outside
of
a
scotch
pulpit
such
splendid
invective
is
he
scotch
said
one
of
the
trustees
of
scotch
parentage
said
the
university
president
i
believe
he
is
one
of
the
dumfarthings
of
dunfermline
dumfries
everybody
said
oh
and
there
was
a
pause
is
he
married
asked
one
of
the
trustees
i
understand
answered
boomer
that
he
is
a
widower
with
one
child
a
little
girl
does
he
make
any
conditions
none
whatever
said
the
chairman
consulting
a
letter
before
him
except
that
he
is
to
have
absolute
control
and
in
regard
to
salary
these
two
points
settled
he
says
he
places
himself
entirely
in
our
hands
and
the
salary
asked
someone
ten
thousand
dollars
said
the
chairman
payable
quarterly
in
advance
a
chorus
of
approval
went
round
the
table
good
excellent
a
man
muttered
the
trustees
just
what
we
want
i
am
sure
gentlemen
said
dick
overend
voicing
the
sentiments
of
everybody
we
do
want
a
cheap
man
several
of
the
candidates
whose
names
have
been
under
consideration
here
have
been
in
many
respects
in
point
of
religious
qualification
let
us
say
most
desirable
men
the
name
of
mcskwirt
for
example
has
been
mentioned
with
great
favour
by
several
of
the
trustees
but
he
a
cheap
man
i
feel
we
do
want
him
what
is
dumfarthing
getting
where
he
is
asked
boulder
nine
thousand
nine
hundred
said
the
chairman
and
dr
mcskwirt
fourteen
hundred
dollars
well
that
settles
it
exclaimed
everybody
with
a
burst
of
enlightenment
and
so
it
was
settled
in
fact
nothing
could
have
been
plainer
i
suppose
said
george
overend
as
they
were
about
to
rise
that
we
are
quite
justified
in
taking
it
for
granted
that
mcteague
will
never
be
able
to
resume
work
oh
absolutely
for
granted
said
boomer
poor
mcteague
i
hear
from
slyder
that
he
was
making
desperate
efforts
this
morning
to
sit
up
in
bed
his
nurse
with
difficulty
prevented
him
is
his
power
of
speech
gone
asked
boulder
practically
so
in
any
case
slyder
insists
on
his
not
using
it
in
fact
poor
mcteague
mind
is
a
wreck
his
nurse
was
telling
me
that
this
morning
he
was
reaching
out
his
hand
for
the
newspaper
and
seemed
to
want
to
read
one
of
the
editorials
it
was
quite
pathetic
concluded
boomer
shaking
his
head
so
the
whole
matter
was
settled
and
next
day
all
the
town
knew
that
osoph
church
had
extended
a
call
to
the
rev
uttermust
dumfarthing
and
that
he
had
accepted
it
within
a
few
weeks
of
this
date
the
reverend
uttermust
dumfarthing
moved
into
the
manse
of
osoph
and
assumed
his
charge
and
forthwith
he
became
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
on
plutoria
avenue
have
you
seen
the
new
minister
of
st
osoph
everybody
asked
have
you
been
to
hear
dr
dumfarthing
were
you
at
osoph
church
on
sunday
morning
ah
you
really
should
go
most
striking
sermon
i
ever
listened
to
the
effect
of
him
was
absolute
and
instantaneous
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
my
dear
said
buncomhearst
to
one
of
her
friends
in
describing
how
she
had
met
him
i
never
saw
a
more
striking
man
such
power
in
his
face
boulder
introduced
him
to
me
on
the
avenue
and
he
hardly
seemed
to
see
me
at
all
simply
scowled
i
was
never
so
favourably
impressed
with
any
man
on
his
very
first
sunday
he
preached
to
his
congregation
on
eternal
punishment
leaning
forward
in
his
black
gown
and
shaking
his
fist
at
them
mcteague
had
never
shaken
his
fist
in
thirty
years
and
as
for
the
rev
fareforth
furlong
he
was
incapable
of
it
but
the
rev
uttermust
dumfarthing
told
his
congregation
that
he
was
convinced
that
at
least
seventy
per
cent
of
them
were
destined
for
eternal
punishment
and
he
did
call
it
by
that
name
but
labelled
it
simply
and
forcibly
hell
the
word
had
not
been
heard
in
any
church
in
the
better
part
of
the
city
for
a
generation
the
congregation
was
so
swelled
next
sunday
that
the
minister
raised
the
percentage
to
and
everybody
went
away
delighted
young
and
old
flocked
to
osoph
before
a
month
had
passed
the
congregation
at
the
evening
service
at
asaph
church
was
so
slender
that
the
offertory
as
furlong
senior
himself
calculated
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
pay
the
overhead
charge
of
collecting
it
the
presence
of
so
many
young
men
sitting
in
serried
files
close
to
the
front
was
the
only
feature
of
his
congregation
that
extorted
from
the
rev
dumfarthing
something
like
approval
it
is
a
joy
to
me
to
see
he
remarked
to
several
of
his
trustees
that
there
are
in
the
city
so
many
godly
young
men
whatever
the
elders
may
be
but
there
may
have
been
a
secondary
cause
at
work
for
among
the
godly
young
men
of
plutoria
avenue
the
topic
of
conversation
had
not
been
have
you
heard
the
new
presbyterian
minister
but
have
you
seen
his
daughter
you
have
well
say
for
it
turned
out
that
the
child
of
uttermust
dumfarthing
by
the
trustees
was
the
kind
of
child
that
wears
a
little
round
hat
straight
from
paris
with
an
upright
feather
in
it
and
a
silk
dress
in
four
sections
and
shoes
with
high
heels
that
would
have
broken
the
heart
of
john
calvin
moreover
she
had
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
person
on
plutoria
avenue
who
was
not
one
whit
afraid
of
the
reverend
uttermust
dumfarthing
she
even
amused
herself
in
violation
of
all
rules
by
attending
evening
service
at
asaph
where
she
sat
listening
to
the
reverend
edward
and
feeling
that
she
had
never
heard
anything
so
sensible
in
her
life
i
simply
dying
to
meet
your
brother
she
said
to
tom
overend
otherwise
philippa
he
such
a
complete
contrast
with
father
she
knew
no
higher
form
of
praise
father
sermons
are
always
so
frightfully
full
of
religion
and
philippa
promised
that
meet
him
she
should
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
effect
of
the
presence
of
catherine
dumfarthing
there
is
no
doubt
the
greater
part
of
the
changed
situation
was
due
to
dumfarthing
himself
everything
he
did
was
calculated
to
please
he
preached
sermons
to
the
rich
and
told
them
they
were
mere
cobwebs
and
they
liked
it
he
preached
a
special
sermon
to
the
poor
and
warned
them
to
be
mighty
careful
he
gave
a
series
of
weekly
talks
to
workingmen
and
knocked
them
sideways
and
in
the
sunday
school
he
gave
the
children
so
fierce
a
talk
on
charity
and
the
need
of
giving
freely
and
quickly
that
such
a
stream
of
pennies
and
nickels
poured
into
catherine
sunday
school
fund
as
had
been
seen
in
the
church
in
fifty
years
nor
was
dumfarthing
different
in
his
private
walk
of
life
he
was
heard
to
speak
openly
of
the
overend
brothers
as
men
of
wrath
and
they
were
so
pleased
that
they
repeated
it
to
half
the
town
it
was
the
best
business
advertisement
they
had
had
for
years
boomer
was
captivated
with
the
man
true
scholarship
he
murmured
as
dumfarthing
poured
undiluted
greek
and
hebrew
from
the
pulpit
scorning
to
translate
a
word
of
it
under
boomer
charge
the
minister
was
taken
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
plutoria
university
and
reviled
it
from
the
foundations
up
our
library
said
the
president
two
hundred
thousand
volumes
aye
said
the
minister
a
powerful
heap
of
rubbish
i
be
bound
the
photograph
of
our
last
year
graduating
class
said
the
president
a
poor
lot
to
judge
by
the
faces
of
them
said
the
minister
this
dumfarthing
is
our
new
radiographic
laboratory
spiff
our
demonstrator
is
preparing
slides
which
i
believe
actually
show
the
movements
of
the
atom
itself
do
they
not
mr
spiff
ah
said
the
minister
piercing
spiff
from
beneath
his
dark
brows
it
will
not
avail
you
young
man
boomer
was
delighted
poor
mcteague
he
said
and
by
the
way
boyster
i
hear
that
mcteague
is
trying
to
walk
again
a
great
error
it
should
be
allowed
poor
mcteague
knew
nothing
of
science
the
students
themselves
shared
in
the
enthusiasm
especially
after
dumfarthing
had
given
them
a
sunday
afternoon
talk
in
which
he
showed
that
their
studies
were
absolutely
futile
as
soon
as
they
knew
this
they
went
to
work
with
a
vigour
that
put
new
life
into
the
college
meantime
the
handsome
face
of
the
reverend
edward
fareforth
furlong
began
to
wear
a
sad
and
weary
look
that
had
never
been
seen
on
it
before
he
watched
the
congregation
drifting
from
asaph
to
osoph
and
was
powerless
to
prevent
it
his
sadness
reached
its
climax
one
bright
afternoon
in
the
late
summer
when
he
noticed
that
even
his
episcopal
blackbirds
were
leaving
his
elms
and
moving
westward
to
the
spruce
trees
of
the
manse
he
stood
looking
at
them
with
melancholy
on
his
face
why
edward
cried
his
sister
philippa
as
her
motor
stopped
beside
him
how
doleful
you
look
get
into
the
car
and
come
out
into
the
country
for
a
ride
let
the
parish
teas
look
after
themselves
for
today
tom
philippa
husband
was
driving
his
own
car
he
was
rich
enough
to
be
able
to
and
seated
with
philippa
in
the
car
was
an
unknown
person
as
prettily
dressed
as
philippa
herself
to
the
rector
she
was
presently
introduced
as
miss
catherine
something
he
did
hear
the
rest
of
it
nor
did
he
need
to
it
was
quite
plain
that
her
surname
whatever
it
was
was
a
very
temporary
and
transitory
affair
so
they
sped
rapidly
out
of
the
city
and
away
out
into
the
country
mile
after
mile
through
cool
crisp
air
and
among
woods
with
the
touch
of
autumn
bright
already
upon
them
and
with
blue
sky
and
great
still
clouds
white
overhead
and
the
afternoon
was
so
beautiful
and
so
bright
that
as
they
went
along
there
was
no
talk
about
religion
at
all
nor
was
there
any
mention
of
mothers
auxiliaries
or
girls
friendly
societies
nor
any
discussion
of
the
poor
it
was
too
glorious
a
day
but
they
spoke
instead
of
the
new
dances
and
whether
they
had
come
to
stay
and
of
such
sensible
topics
as
that
then
presently
as
they
went
on
still
further
philippa
leaned
forwards
and
talked
to
tom
over
his
shoulder
and
reminded
him
that
this
was
the
very
road
to
castel
casteggio
and
asked
him
if
he
remembered
coming
up
it
with
her
to
join
the
newberry
ever
so
long
ago
whatever
it
was
that
tom
answered
it
is
not
recorded
but
it
is
certain
that
it
took
so
long
in
the
saying
that
the
reverend
edward
talked
in
with
catherine
for
fifteen
measured
miles
and
was
unaware
that
it
was
more
than
five
minutes
among
other
things
he
said
and
she
agreed
or
she
said
and
he
agreed
that
for
the
new
dances
it
was
necessary
to
have
always
one
and
the
same
partner
and
to
keep
that
partner
all
the
time
and
somehow
simple
sentiments
of
that
sort
when
said
direct
into
a
pair
of
listening
blue
eyes
behind
a
purple
motor
veil
acquire
an
infinite
significance
then
not
much
after
that
say
three
or
four
minutes
they
were
all
of
a
sudden
back
in
town
again
running
along
plutoria
avenue
and
to
the
rector
surprise
the
motor
was
stopping
outside
the
manse
and
catherine
was
saying
oh
thank
you
ever
so
much
philippa
it
was
just
heavenly
which
showed
that
the
afternoon
had
had
its
religious
features
after
all
what
said
the
rector
sister
as
they
moved
off
again
did
you
know
that
catherine
dumfarthing
when
the
rev
fareforth
furlong
arrived
home
at
the
rectory
he
spent
an
hour
or
so
in
the
deepest
of
deep
thought
in
an
armchair
in
his
study
nor
was
it
any
ordinary
parish
problem
that
he
was
revolving
in
his
mind
he
was
trying
to
think
out
some
means
by
which
his
sister
juliana
might
be
induced
to
commit
the
sin
of
calling
on
the
daughter
of
a
presbyterian
minister
the
thing
had
to
be
represented
as
in
some
fashion
or
other
an
act
of
a
form
of
mortification
of
the
flesh
otherwise
he
knew
juliana
would
never
do
it
but
to
call
on
miss
catherine
dumfarthing
seemed
to
him
such
an
altogether
delightful
and
unspeakably
blissful
process
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
approach
the
topic
so
when
juliana
presently
came
home
the
rector
could
find
no
better
way
of
introducing
the
subject
than
by
putting
it
on
the
ground
of
philippa
marriage
to
miss
dumfarthing
father
trustee
nephew
juliana
he
said
do
you
think
that
perhaps
on
account
of
philippa
and
tom
you
ought
or
at
least
it
might
be
best
for
you
to
call
on
miss
dumfarthing
juliana
turned
to
her
brother
as
he
laid
aside
her
bonnet
and
her
black
gloves
i
just
been
there
this
afternoon
she
said
there
was
something
as
near
to
a
blush
on
her
face
as
her
brother
had
ever
seen
but
she
was
not
there
he
said
no
answered
juliana
but
dumfarthing
was
i
stayed
and
talked
some
time
with
him
waiting
for
her
the
rector
gave
a
sort
of
whistle
or
rather
that
blowing
out
of
air
which
is
the
episcopal
symbol
for
it
did
you
find
him
pretty
solemn
he
said
solemn
answered
his
sister
surely
edward
a
man
in
such
a
calling
as
his
ought
to
be
solemn
i
do
mean
that
exactly
said
the
rector
i
mean
er
hard
bitter
so
to
speak
edward
exclaimed
juliana
how
can
you
speak
so
dumfarthing
hard
dumfarthing
bitter
why
edward
the
man
is
gentleness
and
kindness
itself
i
do
think
i
ever
met
anyone
so
full
of
sympathy
of
compassion
with
suffering
juliana
face
had
flushed
it
was
quite
plain
that
she
saw
things
in
the
reverend
uttermust
dumfarthing
as
some
one
woman
does
in
every
man
that
no
one
else
could
see
the
reverend
edward
was
abashed
i
was
thinking
of
his
character
he
said
i
was
thinking
rather
of
his
doctrines
wait
till
you
have
heard
him
preach
juliana
flushed
more
deeply
still
i
heard
him
last
sunday
evening
she
said
the
rector
was
silent
and
his
sister
as
if
impelled
to
speak
went
on
and
i
do
see
edward
how
anyone
could
think
him
a
hard
or
bigoted
man
in
his
creed
he
walked
home
with
me
to
the
gate
just
now
and
he
was
speaking
of
all
the
sin
in
the
world
and
of
how
few
how
very
few
people
can
be
saved
and
how
many
will
have
to
be
burned
as
worthless
and
he
spoke
so
beautifully
he
regrets
it
edward
regrets
it
deeply
it
is
a
real
grief
to
him
on
which
juliana
half
in
anger
withdrew
and
her
brother
the
rector
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
smiles
rippling
all
over
his
saintly
face
for
he
had
been
wondering
whether
it
would
be
possible
even
remotely
possible
to
get
his
sister
to
invite
the
dumfarthings
to
high
tea
at
the
rectory
some
day
at
six
evening
dinner
was
out
of
the
question
and
now
he
knew
within
himself
that
the
thing
was
as
good
as
done
while
such
things
as
these
were
happening
and
about
to
happen
there
were
many
others
of
the
congregation
of
asaph
beside
the
rector
to
whom
the
growing
situation
gave
cause
for
serious
perplexities
indeed
all
who
were
interested
in
the
church
the
trustees
and
the
mortgagees
and
the
underlying
were
feeling
anxious
for
some
of
them
underlay
the
sunday
school
whose
scholars
offerings
had
declined
forty
per
cent
and
others
underlay
the
new
organ
not
yet
paid
for
while
others
were
lying
deeper
still
beneath
the
ground
site
of
the
church
with
seven
dollars
and
a
half
a
square
foot
resting
on
them
i
do
like
it
said
lucullus
fyshe
to
newberry
they
were
both
prominent
members
of
the
congregation
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
i
took
up
a
block
of
furlong
bonds
on
his
guild
building
from
what
seemed
at
the
time
the
best
of
motives
the
interest
appeared
absolutely
certain
now
it
a
month
overdue
on
the
last
quarter
i
feel
alarmed
neither
do
i
like
it
said
newberry
shaking
his
head
and
sorry
for
fareforth
furlong
an
excellent
fellow
fyshe
excellent
i
keep
wondering
sunday
after
sunday
if
there
is
something
i
can
do
to
help
him
out
one
might
do
something
further
perhaps
in
the
way
of
new
buildings
or
alterations
i
have
in
fact
offered
by
myself
i
mean
and
without
other
aid
to
dynamite
out
the
front
of
his
church
underpin
it
and
put
him
in
a
norman
gateway
either
that
or
blast
out
the
back
of
it
where
the
choir
sit
just
as
he
likes
i
was
thinking
about
it
last
sunday
as
they
were
singing
the
anthem
and
realizing
what
a
lot
one
might
do
there
with
a
few
sticks
of
dynamite
i
doubt
it
said
fyshe
in
fact
newberry
to
speak
very
frankly
i
begin
to
ask
myself
is
furlong
the
man
for
the
post
oh
surely
said
newberry
in
protest
personally
a
charming
fellow
went
on
fyshe
but
is
he
all
said
and
done
quite
the
man
to
conduct
a
church
in
the
place
he
is
a
businessman
no
said
newberry
reluctantly
that
i
admit
very
good
and
even
in
the
matter
of
his
religion
itself
one
always
feels
as
if
he
were
too
little
fixed
too
unstable
he
simply
moves
with
the
times
that
at
least
is
what
people
are
beginning
to
say
of
him
that
he
is
perpetually
moving
with
the
times
it
does
do
newberry
it
does
do
whereupon
newberry
went
away
troubled
and
wrote
to
fareforth
furlong
a
confidential
letter
with
a
signed
cheque
in
it
for
the
amount
of
fyshe
interest
and
with
such
further
offerings
of
dynamite
of
underpinning
and
blasting
as
his
conscience
prompted
when
the
rector
received
and
read
the
note
and
saw
the
figures
of
the
cheque
there
arose
such
a
thankfulness
in
his
spirit
as
he
had
felt
for
months
and
he
may
well
have
murmured
for
the
repose
of
newberry
soul
a
prayer
not
found
in
the
rubric
of
king
james
all
the
more
cause
had
he
to
feel
light
at
heart
for
as
it
chanced
it
was
on
that
same
evening
that
the
dumfarthings
father
and
daughter
were
to
take
tea
at
the
rectory
indeed
a
few
minutes
before
six
they
might
have
been
seen
making
their
way
from
the
manse
to
the
rectory
on
their
way
along
the
avenue
the
minister
took
occasion
to
reprove
his
daughter
for
the
worldliness
of
her
hat
it
was
a
little
trifle
from
new
york
that
she
had
bought
out
of
the
sunday
school
money
a
temporary
loan
and
a
little
further
on
he
spoke
to
her
severely
about
the
parasol
she
carried
and
further
yet
about
the
strange
fashion
specially
condemned
by
the
old
testament
in
which
she
wore
her
hair
so
catherine
knew
in
her
heart
from
this
that
she
must
be
looking
her
very
prettiest
and
went
into
the
rectory
radiant
the
tea
was
of
course
an
awkward
meal
at
the
best
there
was
an
initial
difficulty
about
grace
not
easily
surmounted
and
when
the
rev
dumfarthing
sternly
refused
tea
as
a
pernicious
drink
weakening
to
the
system
the
anglican
rector
was
too
ignorant
of
the
presbyterian
system
to
know
enough
to
give
him
scotch
whiskey
but
there
were
bright
spots
in
the
meal
as
well
the
rector
was
even
able
to
ask
catherine
sideways
as
a
personal
question
if
she
played
tennis
and
she
was
able
to
whisper
behind
her
hand
not
allowed
and
to
make
a
face
in
the
direction
of
her
father
who
was
absorbed
for
the
moment
in
a
theological
question
with
juliana
indeed
before
the
conversation
became
general
again
the
rector
had
contrived
to
make
a
rapid
arrangement
with
catherine
whereby
she
was
to
come
with
him
to
the
newberry
tennis
court
the
day
following
and
learn
the
game
with
or
without
permission
so
the
tea
was
perhaps
a
success
in
its
way
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
juliana
spent
the
days
that
followed
it
in
reading
institutes
specially
loaned
to
her
and
dumfarthing
on
the
certainty
of
damnation
a
gift
and
in
praying
for
her
brother
a
task
practically
without
hope
during
which
same
time
the
rector
in
white
flannels
and
catherine
in
a
white
duck
skirt
and
blouse
were
flying
about
on
the
green
grass
of
the
newberrys
court
and
calling
love
love
all
to
one
another
so
gaily
and
so
brazenly
that
even
newberry
felt
that
there
must
be
something
in
it
but
all
these
things
came
merely
as
interludes
in
the
moving
currents
of
greater
events
for
as
the
summer
faded
into
autumn
and
autumn
into
winter
the
anxieties
of
the
trustees
of
asaph
began
to
call
for
action
of
some
sort
edward
said
the
rector
father
on
the
occasion
of
their
next
quarterly
discussion
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
position
of
things
is
very
serious
your
statements
show
a
falling
off
in
every
direction
your
interest
is
everywhere
in
arrears
your
current
account
overdrawn
to
the
limit
at
this
rate
you
know
the
end
is
inevitable
your
debenture
and
bondholders
will
decide
to
foreclose
and
if
they
do
you
know
there
is
no
power
that
can
stop
them
even
with
your
limited
knowledge
of
business
you
are
probably
aware
that
there
is
no
higher
power
that
can
influence
or
control
the
holder
of
a
first
mortgage
i
fear
so
said
the
rev
edward
very
sadly
do
you
not
think
perhaps
that
some
of
the
shortcoming
lies
with
yourself
continued
furlong
is
it
not
possible
that
as
a
preacher
you
fail
somewhat
do
not
as
it
were
deal
sufficiently
with
fundamental
things
as
others
do
you
leave
untouched
the
truly
vital
issues
such
things
as
the
creation
death
and
if
i
may
refer
to
it
the
life
beyond
the
grave
as
a
result
of
which
the
reverend
edward
preached
a
series
of
special
sermons
on
the
creation
for
which
he
made
a
special
and
arduous
preparation
in
the
library
of
plutoria
university
he
said
that
it
had
taken
a
million
possibly
a
hundred
million
years
of
quite
difficult
work
to
accomplish
and
that
though
when
we
looked
at
it
all
was
darkness
still
we
could
not
be
far
astray
if
we
accepted
and
held
fast
to
the
teachings
of
sir
charles
lyell
the
book
of
genesis
he
said
was
not
to
be
taken
as
meaning
a
day
when
it
said
a
day
but
rather
something
other
than
a
mere
day
and
the
word
light
meant
not
exactly
light
but
possibly
some
sort
of
phosphorescence
and
that
the
use
of
the
word
darkness
was
to
be
understood
not
as
meaning
darkness
but
to
be
taken
as
simply
indicating
obscurity
and
when
he
had
quite
finished
the
congregation
declared
the
whole
sermon
to
be
mere
milk
and
water
it
insulted
their
intelligence
they
said
after
which
a
week
later
the
rev
dumfarthing
took
up
the
same
subject
and
with
the
aid
of
seven
plain
texts
pulverized
the
rector
into
fragments
one
notable
result
of
the
controversy
was
that
juliana
furlong
refused
henceforth
to
attend
her
brother
church
and
sat
even
at
morning
service
under
the
minister
of
osoph
the
sermon
was
i
fear
a
mistake
said
furlong
senior
perhaps
you
had
better
not
dwell
too
much
on
such
topics
we
must
look
for
aid
in
another
direction
in
fact
edward
i
may
mention
to
you
in
confidence
that
certain
of
your
trustees
are
already
devising
ways
and
means
that
may
help
us
out
of
our
dilemma
indeed
although
the
reverend
edward
did
not
know
it
a
certain
idea
or
plan
was
already
germinating
in
the
minds
of
the
most
influential
supporters
of
asaph
such
was
the
situation
of
the
rival
churches
of
asaph
and
osoph
as
the
autumn
slowly
faded
into
winter
during
which
time
the
elm
trees
on
plutoria
avenue
shivered
and
dropped
their
leaves
and
the
chauffeurs
of
the
motors
first
turned
blue
in
their
faces
and
then
when
the
great
snows
came
were
suddenly
converted
into
liveried
coachmen
with
tall
bearskins
and
whiskers
like
russian
horseguards
changing
back
again
to
chauffeurs
the
very
moment
of
a
thaw
during
this
time
also
the
congregation
of
the
reverend
fareforth
furlong
was
diminishing
month
by
month
and
that
of
the
reverend
uttermust
dumfarthing
was
so
numerous
that
they
filled
up
the
aisles
at
the
back
of
the
church
here
the
worshippers
stood
and
froze
for
the
minister
had
abandoned
the
use
of
steam
heat
in
osoph
on
the
ground
that
he
could
find
no
warrant
for
it
during
the
same
period
other
momentous
things
were
happening
such
as
that
juliana
furlong
was
reading
under
the
immediate
guidance
of
dumfarthing
the
history
of
the
progress
of
disruption
in
the
churches
of
scotland
in
ten
volumes
such
also
as
that
catherine
dumfarthing
was
wearing
a
green
and
gold
winter
suit
with
russian
furs
and
a
balkan
hat
and
a
circassian
feather
which
cut
a
wide
swath
of
destruction
among
the
young
men
on
plutoria
avenue
every
afternoon
as
she
passed
moreover
by
the
strangest
of
coincidences
she
scarcely
ever
seemed
to
come
along
the
avenue
without
meeting
the
reverend
edward
a
fact
which
elicited
new
exclamations
of
surprise
from
them
both
every
day
and
by
an
equally
strange
coincidence
they
generally
seemed
although
coming
in
different
directions
to
be
bound
for
the
same
place
towards
which
they
wandered
together
with
such
slow
steps
and
in
such
oblivion
of
the
that
even
the
children
on
the
avenue
knew
by
instinct
whither
they
were
wandering
it
was
noted
also
that
the
broken
figure
of
mcteague
had
reappeared
upon
the
street
leaning
heavily
upon
a
stick
and
greeting
those
he
met
with
such
a
meek
and
willing
affability
as
if
in
apology
for
his
stroke
of
paralysis
that
all
who
talked
with
him
agreed
that
mcteague
mind
was
a
wreck
he
stood
and
spoke
to
me
about
the
children
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
related
one
of
his
former
parishioners
asking
after
them
by
name
and
whether
they
were
going
to
school
yet
and
a
lot
of
questions
like
that
he
never
used
to
speak
of
such
things
poor
old
mcteague
i
afraid
he
is
getting
soft
in
the
head
i
know
said
the
person
addressed
his
mind
is
no
good
he
stopped
me
the
other
day
to
say
how
sorry
he
was
to
hear
about
my
brother
illness
i
could
see
from
the
way
he
spoke
that
his
brain
is
getting
feeble
he
losing
his
grip
he
was
speaking
of
how
kind
people
had
been
to
him
after
his
accident
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
i
think
he
getting
batty
nor
were
even
these
things
the
most
momentous
happenings
of
the
period
for
as
winter
slowly
changed
to
early
spring
it
became
known
that
something
of
great
portent
was
under
way
it
was
rumoured
that
the
trustees
of
asaph
church
were
putting
their
heads
together
this
was
striking
news
the
last
time
that
the
head
of
lucullus
fyshe
for
example
had
been
placed
side
by
side
with
that
of
newberry
there
had
resulted
a
merger
of
four
companies
bringing
what
was
called
industrial
peace
over
an
area
as
big
as
texas
and
raising
the
price
of
soda
by
three
peaceful
cents
per
bottle
and
the
last
time
that
furlong
senior
head
had
been
laid
side
by
side
with
those
of
and
skinyer
they
had
practically
saved
the
country
from
the
horrors
of
a
coal
famine
by
the
simple
process
of
raising
the
price
of
nut
coal
cents
a
ton
and
thus
guaranteeing
its
abundance
naturally
therefore
when
it
became
known
that
such
redoubtable
heads
as
those
of
the
trustees
and
the
underlying
mortgagees
of
were
being
put
together
it
was
fully
expected
that
some
important
development
would
follow
it
was
not
accurately
known
from
which
of
the
assembled
heads
first
proceeded
the
great
idea
which
was
presently
to
solve
the
difficulties
of
the
church
it
may
well
have
come
from
that
of
lucullus
fyshe
certainly
a
head
which
had
brought
peace
out
of
civil
war
in
the
hardware
business
by
amalgamating
ten
rival
stores
and
had
saved
the
very
lives
of
five
hundred
employees
by
reducing
their
wages
fourteen
per
cent
was
capable
of
it
at
any
rate
it
was
fyshe
who
first
gave
the
idea
a
definite
utterance
it
the
only
thing
furlong
he
said
across
the
lunch
table
at
the
mausoleum
club
it
the
one
solution
the
two
churches
ca
live
under
the
present
conditions
of
competition
we
have
here
practically
the
same
situation
as
we
had
with
two
rum
distilleries
the
output
is
too
large
for
the
demand
one
or
both
of
the
two
concerns
must
go
under
it
their
turn
just
now
but
these
fellows
are
business
men
enough
to
know
that
it
may
be
ours
tomorrow
we
offer
them
a
business
solution
we
propose
a
merger
i
been
thinking
of
it
said
furlong
senior
i
suppose
feasible
feasible
exclaimed
fyshe
why
look
what
being
done
every
day
everywhere
from
the
standard
oil
company
downwards
you
would
hardly
i
think
said
furlong
with
a
quiet
smile
compare
the
standard
oil
company
to
a
church
well
no
i
suppose
not
said
fyshe
and
he
too
smiled
in
fact
he
almost
laughed
the
notion
was
too
ridiculous
one
could
hardly
compare
a
mere
church
to
a
thing
of
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
standard
oil
company
but
on
a
lesser
scale
continued
fyshe
it
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
for
the
difficulties
of
it
i
need
remind
you
of
the
much
greater
difficulties
we
had
to
grapple
with
in
the
rum
merger
there
you
remember
a
number
of
the
women
held
out
as
a
matter
of
principle
it
was
not
mere
business
with
them
church
union
is
different
in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
ideas
of
the
day
and
everyone
admits
that
what
is
needed
is
the
application
of
the
ordinary
business
principles
of
harmonious
combination
with
a
proper
er
restriction
of
output
and
general
economy
of
operation
very
good
said
furlong
i
sure
if
you
willing
to
try
the
rest
of
us
are
all
right
said
fyshe
i
thought
of
setting
skinyer
of
skinyer
and
beatem
to
work
on
the
form
of
the
organization
as
you
know
he
is
not
only
a
deeply
religious
man
but
he
has
already
handled
the
tin
pot
combination
and
the
united
hardware
and
the
associated
tanneries
he
ought
to
find
this
quite
simple
within
a
day
or
two
skinyer
had
already
commenced
his
labours
i
must
first
he
said
get
an
accurate
idea
of
the
existing
legal
organization
of
the
two
churches
for
which
purpose
he
approached
the
rector
of
asaph
i
just
want
to
ask
you
furlong
said
the
lawyer
a
question
or
two
as
to
the
exact
constitution
the
form
so
to
speak
of
your
church
what
is
it
is
it
a
single
corporate
body
i
suppose
said
the
rector
thoughtfully
one
would
define
it
as
an
indivisible
spiritual
unit
manifesting
itself
on
earth
quite
so
interrupted
skinyer
but
i
do
mean
what
it
is
in
the
religious
sense
i
mean
in
the
real
sense
i
fail
to
understand
said
furlong
let
me
put
it
very
clearly
said
the
lawyer
where
does
it
get
its
authority
from
above
said
the
rector
reverently
precisely
said
skinyer
no
doubt
but
i
mean
its
authority
in
the
exact
sense
of
the
term
it
was
enjoined
on
peter
began
the
rector
but
skinyer
interrupted
him
that
i
am
aware
of
he
said
but
what
i
mean
is
where
does
your
church
get
its
power
for
example
to
hold
property
to
collect
debts
to
use
distraint
against
the
property
of
others
to
foreclose
its
mortgages
and
to
cause
judgement
to
be
executed
against
those
who
fail
to
pay
their
debts
to
it
you
will
say
at
once
that
it
has
these
powers
direct
from
heaven
no
doubt
that
is
true
and
no
religious
person
would
deny
it
but
we
lawyers
are
compelled
to
take
a
narrower
a
less
elevating
point
of
view
are
these
powers
conferred
on
you
by
the
state
legislature
or
by
some
higher
authority
oh
by
a
higher
authority
i
hope
said
the
rector
very
fervently
whereupon
skinyer
left
him
without
further
questioning
the
rector
brain
being
evidently
unfit
for
the
subject
of
corporation
law
on
the
other
hand
he
got
satisfaction
from
the
rev
dumfarthing
at
once
the
church
of
osoph
said
the
minister
is
a
perpetual
trust
holding
property
as
such
under
a
general
law
of
the
state
and
able
as
such
to
be
made
the
object
of
suit
or
distraint
i
speak
with
some
assurance
as
i
had
occasion
to
enquire
into
the
matter
at
the
time
when
i
was
looking
for
guidance
in
regard
to
the
call
i
had
received
to
come
here
it
a
quite
simple
matter
skinyer
presently
reported
to
fyshe
one
of
the
churches
is
a
perpetual
trust
the
other
practically
a
state
corporation
each
has
full
control
over
its
property
provided
nothing
is
done
by
either
to
infringe
the
purity
of
its
doctrine
just
what
does
that
mean
asked
fyshe
it
must
maintain
its
doctrine
absolutely
pure
otherwise
if
certain
of
its
trustees
remain
pure
and
the
rest
do
not
those
who
stay
pure
are
entitled
to
take
the
whole
of
the
property
this
i
believe
happens
every
day
in
scotland
where
of
course
there
is
great
eagerness
to
remain
pure
in
doctrine
and
what
do
you
define
as
doctrine
asked
fyshe
if
the
trustees
are
in
dispute
said
skinyer
the
courts
decide
but
any
doctrine
is
held
to
be
a
pure
doctrine
if
the
trustees
regard
it
as
a
pure
doctrine
i
see
said
fyshe
thoughtfully
it
the
same
thing
as
what
we
called
policy
on
the
part
of
directors
in
the
tin
pot
combination
exactly
assented
skinyer
and
it
means
that
for
the
merger
we
need
nothing
i
state
it
very
frankly
except
general
consent
the
preliminary
stages
of
the
making
of
the
merger
followed
along
familiar
business
lines
the
trustees
of
asaph
went
through
the
process
known
as
the
trustees
of
osoph
first
of
all
for
example
lucullus
fyshe
invited
asmodeus
boulder
of
osoph
to
lunch
with
him
at
the
mausoleum
club
the
cost
of
the
lunch
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
was
charged
to
the
general
expense
account
of
the
church
of
course
nothing
whatever
was
said
during
the
lunch
about
the
churches
or
their
finances
or
anything
concerning
them
such
discussion
would
have
been
a
gross
business
impropriety
a
few
days
later
the
two
brothers
overend
dined
with
furlong
senior
the
dinner
being
charged
directly
to
the
contingencies
account
of
asaph
after
which
skinyer
and
his
partner
beatem
went
to
the
spring
races
together
on
the
profit
and
loss
account
of
osoph
and
philippa
overend
and
catherine
dumfarthing
were
taken
by
the
unforeseen
disbursements
account
to
the
grand
opera
followed
by
a
midnight
supper
all
of
these
things
constituted
what
was
called
the
promotion
of
the
merger
and
were
almost
exactly
identical
with
the
successive
stages
of
the
making
of
the
amalgamated
distilleries
and
the
associated
tin
pot
corporation
which
was
considered
a
most
hopeful
sign
do
you
think
they
go
into
it
asked
newberry
of
furlong
senior
anxiously
after
all
what
inducement
have
they
every
inducement
said
furlong
all
said
and
done
they
only
one
large
asset
dumfarthing
we
really
offering
to
buy
up
dumfarthing
by
pooling
our
assets
with
theirs
and
what
does
dumfarthing
himself
say
to
it
ah
there
i
am
not
so
sure
said
furlong
that
may
be
a
difficulty
so
far
there
has
been
a
word
from
him
and
his
trustees
are
absolutely
silent
about
his
views
however
we
shall
soon
know
all
about
it
skinyer
is
asking
us
all
to
come
together
one
evening
next
week
to
draw
up
the
articles
of
agreement
has
he
got
the
financial
basis
arranged
then
i
believe
so
said
furlong
his
idea
is
to
form
a
new
corporation
to
be
known
as
the
united
church
limited
or
by
some
similar
name
all
the
present
mortgagees
will
be
converted
into
unified
bondholders
the
pew
rents
will
be
capitalized
into
preferred
stock
and
the
common
stock
drawing
its
dividend
from
the
offertory
will
be
distributed
among
all
members
in
standing
skinyer
says
that
it
is
really
an
ideal
form
of
church
union
one
that
he
thinks
is
likely
to
be
widely
adopted
it
has
the
advantage
of
removing
all
questions
of
religion
which
he
says
are
practically
the
only
remaining
obstacle
to
a
union
of
all
the
churches
in
fact
it
puts
the
churches
once
and
for
all
on
a
business
basis
but
what
about
the
question
of
doctrine
of
belief
asked
newberry
skinyer
says
he
can
settle
it
answered
furlong
about
a
week
after
the
above
conversation
the
united
trustees
of
asaph
and
osoph
were
gathered
about
a
huge
table
in
the
board
room
of
the
mausoleum
club
they
were
seated
in
intermingled
fashion
after
the
precedent
of
the
recent
tin
pot
amalgamation
and
were
smoking
huge
black
cigars
specially
kept
by
the
club
for
the
promotion
of
companies
and
chargeable
to
expenses
of
organization
at
fifty
cents
a
cigar
there
was
an
air
of
deep
peace
brooding
over
the
assembly
as
among
men
who
have
accomplished
a
difficult
and
meritorious
task
well
then
said
skinyer
who
was
in
the
chair
with
a
pile
of
documents
in
front
of
him
i
think
that
our
general
basis
of
financial
union
may
be
viewed
as
settled
a
murmur
of
assent
went
round
the
meeting
the
terms
are
set
forth
in
the
memorandum
before
us
which
you
have
already
signed
only
one
other
point
a
minor
one
remains
to
be
considered
i
refer
to
the
doctrines
or
the
religious
belief
of
the
new
amalgamation
is
it
necessary
to
go
into
that
asked
boulder
not
entirely
perhaps
said
skinyer
still
there
have
been
as
you
all
know
certain
points
i
wo
say
of
disagreement
but
let
us
say
of
friendly
argument
between
the
members
of
the
different
churches
such
things
for
example
here
he
consulted
his
papers
as
the
theory
of
the
creation
the
salvation
of
the
soul
and
so
forth
have
been
mentioned
in
this
connection
i
have
a
memorandum
of
them
here
though
the
points
escape
me
for
the
moment
these
you
may
say
are
not
matters
of
first
importance
especially
as
compared
with
the
intricate
financial
questions
which
we
have
already
settled
in
a
satisfactory
manner
still
i
think
it
might
be
well
if
i
were
permitted
with
your
unanimous
approval
to
jot
down
a
memorandum
or
two
to
be
afterwards
embodied
in
our
articles
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
approval
very
good
said
skinyer
settling
himself
back
in
his
chair
now
first
in
regard
to
the
creation
here
he
looked
all
round
the
meeting
in
a
way
to
command
attention
is
it
your
wish
that
we
should
leave
that
merely
to
a
gentlemen
agreement
or
do
you
want
an
explicit
clause
i
think
it
might
be
well
said
dick
overend
to
leave
no
doubt
about
the
theory
of
the
creation
good
said
skinyer
i
am
going
to
put
it
down
then
something
after
this
fashion
and
after
let
us
say
august
proximo
the
process
of
the
creation
shall
be
held
and
is
hereby
held
to
be
such
and
such
only
as
is
acceptable
to
a
majority
of
the
holders
of
common
and
preferred
stock
voting
pro
rata
is
that
agreed
carried
cried
several
at
once
carried
repeated
skinyer
now
let
us
pass
on
here
he
consulted
his
notes
to
item
two
eternal
punishment
i
have
made
a
memorandum
as
follows
any
doubts
arise
on
or
after
august
first
proximo
as
to
the
existence
of
eternal
punishment
they
shall
be
settled
absolutely
and
finally
by
a
vote
of
all
the
holders
of
common
and
preferred
stock
is
that
agreed
one
moment
said
fyshe
do
you
think
that
quite
fair
to
the
bondholders
after
all
as
the
virtual
holders
of
the
property
they
are
the
persons
most
interested
i
should
like
to
amend
your
clause
and
make
it
read
i
am
not
phrasing
it
exactly
but
merely
giving
the
sense
of
it
that
eternal
punishment
should
be
reserved
for
the
mortgagees
and
bondholders
at
this
there
was
an
outbreak
of
mingled
approval
and
dissent
several
persons
speaking
at
once
in
the
opinion
of
some
the
stockholders
of
the
company
especially
the
preferred
stockholders
had
as
good
a
right
to
eternal
punishment
as
the
bondholders
presently
skinyer
who
had
been
busily
writing
notes
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
gentlemen
he
said
will
you
accept
this
as
a
compromise
we
will
keep
the
original
clause
but
merely
add
to
it
the
words
no
form
of
eternal
punishment
shall
be
declared
valid
if
displeasing
to
a
majority
of
the
holders
of
bonds
carried
carried
cried
everybody
to
which
i
think
we
need
only
add
said
skinyer
a
clause
to
the
effect
that
all
other
points
of
doctrine
belief
or
religious
principle
may
be
freely
altered
amended
reversed
or
entirely
abolished
at
any
general
annual
meeting
there
was
a
renewed
chorus
of
carried
carried
and
the
trustees
rose
from
the
table
shaking
hands
with
one
another
and
lighting
fresh
cigars
as
they
passed
out
of
the
club
into
the
night
air
the
only
thing
that
i
do
understand
said
newberry
to
boomer
as
they
went
out
from
the
club
arm
in
arm
for
they
might
now
walk
in
that
fashion
with
the
same
propriety
as
two
of
the
principals
in
a
distillery
merger
the
only
thing
that
i
do
understand
is
why
the
reverend
dumfarthing
should
be
willing
to
consent
to
the
amalgamation
do
you
really
not
know
said
boomer
no
you
have
heard
nothing
not
a
word
said
newberry
ah
rejoined
the
president
i
see
that
our
men
have
kept
it
very
quiet
naturally
so
in
view
of
the
circumstances
the
truth
is
that
the
reverend
dumfarthing
is
leaving
us
leaving
st
osoph
exclaimed
newberry
in
utter
astonishment
to
our
great
regret
he
has
had
a
call
a
most
inviting
field
of
work
he
says
a
splendid
opportunity
they
offered
him
ten
thousand
one
hundred
we
were
only
giving
him
ten
thousand
here
though
of
course
that
feature
of
the
situation
would
not
weigh
at
all
with
a
man
like
dumfarthing
oh
no
of
course
not
said
newberry
as
soon
as
we
heard
of
the
call
we
offered
him
ten
thousand
three
hundred
not
that
that
would
make
any
difference
to
a
man
of
his
character
indeed
dumfarthing
was
still
waiting
and
looking
for
guidance
when
they
offered
him
eleven
thousand
we
could
meet
it
it
was
beyond
us
though
we
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
with
such
a
man
as
dumfarthing
the
money
made
no
difference
and
he
has
accepted
the
call
yes
he
accepted
it
today
he
sent
word
to
dick
overend
our
chairman
that
he
would
remain
in
his
manse
looking
for
light
until
after
which
if
we
had
not
communicated
with
him
by
that
hour
he
would
cease
to
look
for
it
dear
me
said
newberry
deep
in
reflection
so
that
when
your
trustees
came
to
the
meeting
exactly
said
boomer
and
something
like
a
smile
passed
across
his
features
for
a
moment
dumfarthing
had
already
sent
away
his
telegram
of
acceptance
why
then
said
newberry
at
the
time
of
our
discussion
tonight
you
were
in
the
position
of
having
no
minister
not
at
all
we
had
already
appointed
a
successor
a
successor
certainly
it
will
be
in
tomorrow
morning
papers
the
fact
is
that
we
decided
to
ask
mcteague
to
resume
his
charge
dr
mcteague
repeated
newberry
in
amazement
but
surely
his
mind
is
understood
to
be
oh
not
at
all
interrupted
boomer
his
mind
appears
if
anything
to
be
clearer
and
stronger
than
ever
slyder
tells
us
that
paralysis
of
the
brain
very
frequently
has
this
effect
it
soothes
the
brain
clears
it
as
it
were
so
that
very
often
intellectual
problems
which
occasioned
the
greatest
perplexity
before
present
no
difficulty
whatever
afterwards
mcteague
i
believe
finds
no
trouble
now
in
reconciling
paul
dialectic
with
hegel
as
he
used
to
he
says
that
so
far
as
he
can
see
they
both
mean
the
same
thing
well
well
said
newberry
and
will
mcteague
also
resume
his
philosophical
lectures
at
the
university
we
think
it
wiser
not
said
the
president
while
we
feel
that
mcteague
mind
is
in
admirable
condition
for
clerical
work
we
fear
that
professorial
duties
might
strain
it
in
order
to
get
the
full
value
of
his
remarkable
intelligence
we
propose
to
elect
him
to
the
governing
body
of
the
university
there
his
brain
will
be
safe
from
any
shock
as
a
professor
there
would
always
be
the
fear
that
one
of
his
students
might
raise
a
question
in
his
class
this
of
course
is
not
a
difficulty
that
arises
in
the
pulpit
or
among
the
governors
of
the
university
of
course
not
said
newberry
thus
was
constituted
the
famous
union
or
merger
of
the
churches
of
asaph
and
osoph
viewed
by
many
of
those
who
made
it
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
the
modern
church
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
has
been
in
every
way
an
eminent
success
rivalry
competition
and
controversies
over
points
of
dogma
have
become
unknown
on
plutoria
avenue
the
parishioners
of
the
two
churches
may
now
attend
either
of
them
just
as
they
like
as
the
trustees
are
fond
of
explaining
it
does
make
the
slightest
difference
the
entire
receipts
of
the
churches
being
now
pooled
are
divided
without
reference
to
individual
attendance
at
each
half
year
there
is
issued
a
printed
statement
which
is
addressed
to
the
shareholders
of
the
united
churches
limited
and
is
hardly
to
be
distinguished
in
style
or
material
from
the
annual
and
reports
of
the
tin
pot
amalgamation
and
the
united
hardware
and
other
bodies
of
the
sort
your
directors
the
last
of
these
documents
states
are
happy
to
inform
you
that
in
spite
of
the
prevailing
industrial
depression
the
gross
receipts
of
the
corporation
have
shown
such
an
increase
as
to
justify
the
distribution
of
a
stock
dividend
of
special
offertory
stock
cumulative
which
will
be
offered
at
par
to
all
holders
of
common
or
preferred
shares
you
will
also
be
gratified
to
learn
that
the
directors
have
voted
unanimously
in
favour
of
a
special
presentation
to
the
rev
uttermust
dumfarthing
on
the
occasion
of
his
approaching
marriage
it
was
earnestly
debated
whether
this
gift
should
take
the
form
as
at
first
suggested
of
a
cash
presentation
or
as
afterwards
suggested
of
a
written
testimonial
in
the
form
of
an
address
the
latter
course
was
finally
adopted
as
being
more
fitting
to
the
circumstances
and
the
address
has
accordingly
been
prepared
setting
forth
to
the
rev
dumfarthing
in
old
english
lettering
and
wording
the
opinion
which
is
held
of
him
by
his
former
parishioners
the
approaching
marriage
referred
of
course
to
betrothal
to
juliana
furlong
it
was
not
known
that
he
had
ever
exactly
proposed
to
her
but
it
was
understood
that
before
giving
up
his
charge
he
drew
her
attention
in
very
severe
terms
to
the
fact
that
as
his
daughter
was
now
leaving
him
he
must
either
have
someone
else
to
look
after
his
manse
or
else
be
compelled
to
incur
the
expense
of
a
paid
housekeeper
this
latter
alternative
he
said
was
not
one
that
he
cared
to
contemplate
he
also
reminded
her
that
she
was
now
at
a
time
of
life
when
she
could
hardly
expect
to
pick
and
choose
and
that
her
spiritual
condition
was
one
of
at
least
great
uncertainty
these
combined
statements
are
held
under
the
law
of
scotland
at
any
rate
to
be
equivalent
to
an
offer
of
marriage
catherine
dumfarthing
did
not
join
her
father
in
his
new
manse
she
first
remained
behind
him
as
the
guest
of
philippa
overend
for
a
few
weeks
while
she
was
occupied
in
packing
up
her
things
after
that
she
stayed
for
another
two
or
three
weeks
to
unpack
them
this
had
been
rendered
necessary
by
a
conversation
held
with
the
reverend
edward
fareforth
furlong
in
a
shaded
corner
of
the
overend
garden
after
which
in
due
course
of
time
catherine
and
edward
were
married
the
ceremony
being
performed
by
the
reverend
mcteague
whose
eyes
filled
with
philosophical
tears
as
he
gave
them
his
blessing
so
the
two
churches
of
asaph
and
osoph
stand
side
by
side
united
and
at
peace
their
bells
call
softly
back
and
forward
to
one
another
on
sunday
mornings
and
such
is
the
harmony
between
them
that
even
the
episcopal
rooks
in
the
elm
trees
of
asaph
and
the
presbyterian
crows
in
the
spruce
trees
of
osoph
are
known
to
exchange
perches
on
alternate
sundays
chapter
eight
the
great
fight
for
clean
government
as
to
the
government
of
this
city
said
newberry
leaning
back
in
a
leather
armchair
at
the
mausoleum
club
and
lighting
a
second
cigar
it
rotten
that
all
absolutely
rotten
assented
dick
overend
ringing
the
bell
for
a
second
whiskey
and
soda
corrupt
said
newberry
between
two
puffs
of
his
cigar
full
of
graft
said
overend
flicking
his
ashes
into
the
grate
crooked
aldermen
said
newberry
a
bum
city
solicitor
said
overend
and
an
infernal
grafter
for
treasurer
yes
assented
newberry
and
then
leaning
forwards
in
his
chair
and
looking
carefully
about
the
corridors
of
the
club
he
spoke
behind
his
hand
and
said
and
the
mayor
the
biggest
grafter
of
the
lot
and
what
more
he
added
sinking
his
voice
to
a
whisper
the
time
has
come
to
speak
out
about
it
fearlessly
overend
nodded
it
a
tyranny
he
said
worse
than
russia
rejoined
newberry
they
had
been
sitting
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
club
it
was
on
a
sunday
evening
and
had
fallen
into
talking
first
of
all
of
the
present
rottenness
of
the
federal
politics
of
the
united
states
not
argumentatively
or
with
any
heat
but
with
the
reflective
sadness
that
steals
over
an
elderly
man
when
he
sits
in
the
leather
armchair
of
a
comfortable
club
smoking
a
good
cigar
and
musing
on
the
decadence
of
the
present
day
the
rottenness
of
the
federal
government
did
anger
them
it
merely
grieved
them
they
could
remember
both
of
them
how
different
everything
was
when
they
were
young
men
just
entering
on
life
when
newberry
and
dick
overend
were
young
men
went
into
congress
from
pure
patriotism
there
was
no
such
thing
as
graft
or
crookedness
as
they
both
admitted
in
those
days
and
as
for
the
united
states
senate
here
their
voices
were
almost
hushed
in
awe
why
when
they
were
young
the
united
states
senate
but
no
neither
of
them
could
find
a
phrase
big
enough
for
their
meaning
they
merely
repeated
as
for
the
united
states
senate
and
then
shook
their
heads
and
took
long
drinks
of
whiskey
and
soda
then
naturally
speaking
of
the
rottenness
of
the
federal
government
had
led
them
to
talk
of
the
rottenness
of
the
state
legislature
how
different
from
the
state
legislatures
that
they
remembered
as
young
men
not
merely
different
in
the
matter
of
graft
but
different
so
newberry
said
in
the
calibre
of
the
men
he
recalled
how
he
had
been
taken
as
a
boy
of
twelve
by
his
father
to
hear
a
debate
he
would
never
forget
it
giants
he
said
that
was
what
they
were
in
fact
the
thing
was
more
like
a
witenagemot
than
a
legislature
he
said
he
distinctly
recalled
a
man
whose
name
he
did
recollect
speaking
on
a
question
he
did
just
remember
what
either
for
or
against
he
just
recall
which
it
thrilled
him
he
would
never
forget
it
it
stayed
in
his
memory
as
if
it
were
yesterday
but
as
for
the
present
legislature
here
dick
overend
sadly
nodded
assent
in
advance
to
what
he
knew
was
coming
as
for
the
present
legislature
well
newberry
had
had
he
said
occasion
to
visit
the
state
capital
a
week
before
in
connection
with
a
railway
bill
that
he
was
trying
to
that
is
that
he
was
anxious
to
in
short
in
connection
with
a
railway
bill
and
when
he
looked
about
him
at
the
men
in
the
legislature
positively
he
felt
ashamed
he
could
put
it
no
other
way
than
that
ashamed
after
which
from
speaking
of
the
crookedness
of
the
state
government
newberry
and
dick
overend
were
led
to
talk
of
the
crookedness
of
the
city
government
and
they
both
agreed
as
above
that
things
were
worse
than
in
russia
what
secretly
irritated
them
both
most
was
that
they
had
lived
and
done
business
under
this
infernal
corruption
for
thirty
or
forty
years
and
had
noticed
it
they
had
been
too
busy
the
fact
was
that
their
conversation
reflected
not
so
much
their
own
original
ideas
as
a
general
wave
of
feeling
that
was
passing
over
the
whole
community
there
had
come
a
moment
quite
suddenly
it
seemed
when
it
occurred
to
everybody
at
the
same
time
that
the
whole
government
of
the
city
was
rotten
the
word
is
a
strong
one
but
it
is
the
one
that
was
used
look
at
the
aldermen
they
said
rotten
look
at
the
city
solicitor
rotten
and
as
for
the
mayor
himself
phew
the
thing
came
like
a
wave
everybody
felt
it
at
once
people
wondered
how
any
sane
intelligent
community
could
tolerate
the
presence
of
a
set
of
corrupt
scoundrels
like
the
twenty
aldermen
of
the
city
their
names
it
was
said
were
simply
a
byword
throughout
the
united
states
for
rank
criminal
corruption
this
was
said
so
widely
that
everybody
started
hunting
through
the
daily
papers
to
try
to
find
out
who
in
blazes
were
aldermen
anyhow
twenty
names
are
hard
to
remember
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
moment
when
this
wave
of
feeling
struck
the
city
nobody
knew
or
cared
who
were
aldermen
anyway
to
tell
the
truth
the
aldermen
had
been
much
the
same
persons
for
about
fifteen
or
twenty
years
some
were
in
the
produce
business
others
were
butchers
two
were
grocers
and
all
of
them
wore
blue
checkered
waistcoats
and
red
ties
and
got
up
at
seven
in
the
morning
to
attend
the
vegetable
and
other
markets
nobody
had
ever
really
thought
about
them
that
is
to
say
nobody
on
plutoria
avenue
sometimes
one
saw
a
picture
in
the
paper
and
wondered
for
a
moment
who
the
person
was
but
on
looking
more
closely
and
noticing
what
was
written
under
it
one
said
oh
i
see
an
alderman
and
turned
to
something
else
whose
funeral
is
that
a
man
would
sometimes
ask
on
plutoria
avenue
oh
just
one
of
the
city
aldermen
a
passerby
would
answer
hurriedly
oh
i
see
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
it
might
be
somebody
important
at
which
both
laughed
it
was
not
just
clear
how
and
where
this
movement
of
indignation
had
started
people
said
that
it
was
part
of
a
new
wave
of
public
morality
that
was
sweeping
over
the
entire
united
states
certainly
it
was
being
remarked
in
almost
every
section
of
the
country
chicago
newspapers
were
attributing
its
origin
to
the
new
vigour
and
the
fresh
ideals
of
the
middle
west
in
boston
it
was
said
to
be
due
to
a
revival
of
the
grand
old
new
england
spirit
in
philadelphia
they
called
it
the
spirit
of
william
penn
in
the
south
it
was
said
to
be
the
reassertion
of
southern
chivalry
making
itself
felt
against
the
greed
and
selfishness
of
the
north
while
in
the
north
they
recognized
it
at
once
as
a
protest
against
the
sluggishness
and
ignorance
of
the
south
in
the
west
they
spoke
of
it
as
a
revolt
against
the
spirit
of
the
east
and
in
the
east
they
called
it
a
reaction
against
the
lawlessness
of
the
west
but
everywhere
they
hailed
it
as
a
new
sign
of
the
glorious
unity
of
the
country
if
therefore
newberry
and
overend
were
found
to
be
discussing
the
corrupt
state
of
their
city
they
only
shared
in
the
national
sentiments
of
the
moment
in
fact
in
the
same
city
hundreds
of
other
citizens
as
disinterested
as
themselves
were
waking
up
to
the
realization
of
what
was
going
on
as
soon
as
people
began
to
look
into
the
condition
of
things
in
the
city
they
were
horrified
at
what
they
found
it
was
discovered
for
example
that
alderman
schwefeldampf
was
an
undertaker
think
of
it
in
a
city
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
deaths
a
week
and
sometimes
even
better
an
undertaker
sat
on
the
council
a
city
that
was
about
to
expropriate
land
and
to
spend
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
a
new
cemetery
had
an
undertaker
on
the
expropriation
committee
itself
and
worse
than
that
alderman
undercutt
was
a
butcher
in
a
city
that
consumed
a
thousand
tons
of
meat
every
week
and
alderman
it
leaked
out
was
an
irishman
imagine
it
an
irishman
sitting
on
the
police
committee
of
the
council
in
a
city
where
and
a
half
out
of
every
hundred
policemen
were
irish
either
by
birth
or
parentage
the
thing
was
monstrous
so
when
newberry
said
it
worse
than
russia
he
meant
it
every
word
now
just
as
newberry
and
dick
overend
were
finishing
their
discussion
the
huge
bulky
form
of
mayor
mcgrath
came
ponderously
past
them
as
they
sat
he
looked
at
them
sideways
out
of
his
eyes
he
had
eyes
like
plums
in
a
mottled
face
and
being
a
born
politician
he
knew
by
the
very
look
of
them
that
they
were
talking
of
something
that
they
had
no
business
to
be
talking
about
but
being
a
politician
he
merely
said
good
evening
gentlemen
without
a
sign
of
disturbance
good
evening
mayor
said
newberry
rubbing
his
hands
feebly
together
and
speaking
in
an
ingratiating
tone
there
is
no
more
pitiable
spectacle
than
an
honest
man
caught
in
the
act
of
speaking
boldly
and
fearlessly
of
the
good
evening
mayor
echoed
dick
overend
also
rubbing
his
hands
warm
evening
is
it
not
the
mayor
gave
no
other
answer
than
that
deep
guttural
grunt
which
is
technically
known
in
municipal
interviews
as
refusing
to
commit
oneself
did
he
hear
whispered
newberry
as
the
mayor
passed
out
of
the
club
i
do
care
if
he
did
whispered
dick
overend
half
an
hour
later
mayor
mcgrath
entered
the
premises
of
the
thomas
jefferson
club
which
was
situated
in
the
rear
end
of
a
saloon
and
pool
room
far
down
in
the
town
boys
he
said
to
alderman
and
alderman
gorfinkel
who
were
playing
poker
in
a
corner
behind
the
pool
tables
you
want
to
let
the
boys
know
to
keep
pretty
dark
and
go
easy
there
a
lot
of
talk
i
do
like
about
the
elections
going
round
the
town
let
the
boys
know
that
just
for
a
while
the
darker
they
keep
the
better
whereupon
the
word
was
passed
from
the
thomas
jefferson
club
to
the
george
washington
club
and
thence
to
the
eureka
club
coloured
and
to
the
kossuth
club
hungarian
and
to
various
other
centres
of
civic
patriotism
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
city
and
forthwith
such
a
darkness
began
to
spread
over
them
that
not
even
honest
diogenes
with
his
lantern
could
have
penetrated
their
doings
if
them
stiffs
wants
to
make
trouble
said
the
president
of
the
george
washington
club
to
mayor
mcgrath
a
day
or
two
later
they
never
know
what
they
bumped
up
against
well
said
the
heavy
mayor
speaking
slowly
and
cautiously
and
eyeing
his
henchman
with
quiet
scrutiny
you
want
to
go
pretty
easy
now
i
tell
you
the
look
which
the
mayor
directed
at
his
satellite
was
much
the
same
glance
that
morgan
the
buccaneer
might
have
given
to
one
of
his
lieutenants
before
throwing
him
overboard
meantime
the
wave
of
civic
enthusiasm
as
reflected
in
the
conversations
of
plutoria
avenue
grew
stronger
with
every
day
the
thing
is
a
scandal
said
lucullus
fyshe
why
these
fellows
down
at
the
city
hall
are
simply
a
pack
of
rogues
i
had
occasion
to
do
some
business
there
the
other
day
it
was
connected
with
the
assessment
of
our
soda
factories
and
do
you
know
i
actually
found
that
these
fellows
take
money
i
say
said
peter
spillikins
to
whom
he
spoke
i
say
you
say
it
a
fact
repeated
fyshe
they
take
money
i
took
the
assistant
treasurer
aside
and
i
said
want
such
and
such
done
and
i
slipped
a
fifty
dollar
bill
into
his
hand
and
the
fellow
took
it
took
it
like
a
shot
he
took
it
gasped
spillikins
he
did
said
fyshe
there
ought
to
be
a
criminal
law
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
say
exclaimed
spillikins
they
ought
to
go
to
jail
for
a
thing
like
that
and
the
infernal
insolence
of
them
fyshe
continued
i
went
down
the
next
day
to
see
the
deputy
assistant
about
a
thing
connected
with
the
same
matter
told
him
what
i
wanted
and
passed
a
fifty
dollar
bill
across
the
counter
and
the
fellow
fairly
threw
it
back
at
me
in
a
perfect
rage
he
refused
it
refused
it
gasped
spillikins
i
say
conversations
such
as
this
filled
up
the
leisure
and
divided
the
business
time
of
all
the
best
people
in
the
city
in
the
general
gloomy
outlook
however
one
bright
spot
was
observable
the
wave
had
evidently
come
just
at
the
opportune
moment
for
not
only
were
civic
elections
pending
but
just
at
this
juncture
four
or
five
questions
of
supreme
importance
would
be
settled
by
the
incoming
council
there
was
for
instance
the
question
of
the
expropriation
of
the
traction
company
a
matter
involving
many
millions
there
was
the
decision
as
to
the
renewal
of
the
franchise
of
the
citizens
light
company
a
vital
question
there
was
also
the
four
hundred
thousand
dollar
purchase
of
land
for
the
new
addition
to
the
cemetery
a
matter
that
must
be
settled
and
it
was
felt
especially
on
plutoria
avenue
to
be
a
splendid
thing
that
the
city
was
waking
up
in
the
moral
sense
at
the
very
time
when
these
things
were
under
discussion
all
the
shareholders
of
the
traction
company
and
the
citizens
light
and
they
included
the
very
best
the
most
people
in
the
city
felt
that
what
was
needed
now
was
a
great
moral
effort
to
enable
them
to
lift
the
city
up
and
carry
it
with
them
or
if
not
all
of
it
at
any
rate
as
much
of
it
as
they
could
it
a
splendid
movement
said
fyshe
he
was
a
leading
shareholder
and
director
of
the
citizens
light
what
a
splendid
thing
to
think
that
we
sha
have
to
deal
for
our
new
franchise
with
a
set
of
corrupt
rapscallions
like
these
present
aldermen
do
you
know
furlong
that
when
we
approached
them
first
with
a
proposition
for
a
renewal
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
they
held
us
up
said
it
was
too
long
imagine
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
only
a
century
and
a
half
too
long
for
the
franchise
they
expect
us
to
install
all
our
poles
string
our
wires
set
up
our
transformers
in
their
streets
and
then
perhaps
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
years
find
ourselves
compelled
to
sell
out
at
a
beggarly
valuation
of
course
we
knew
what
they
wanted
they
meant
us
to
hand
them
over
fifty
dollars
each
to
stuff
into
their
rascally
pockets
outrageous
said
furlong
and
the
same
thing
with
the
cemetery
land
deal
went
on
lucullus
fyshe
do
you
realize
that
if
the
movement
had
come
along
and
checked
them
those
scoundrels
would
have
given
that
rogue
schwefeldampf
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
his
fifty
acres
just
think
of
it
i
do
know
said
furlong
with
a
thoughtful
look
upon
his
face
that
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
is
an
excessive
price
in
and
of
itself
for
that
amount
of
land
certainly
not
said
fyshe
very
quietly
and
decidedly
looking
at
furlong
in
a
searching
way
as
he
spoke
it
is
a
high
price
it
seems
to
me
speaking
purely
as
an
outsider
a
very
fair
reasonable
price
for
fifty
acres
of
suburban
land
if
it
were
the
right
land
if
for
example
it
were
a
case
of
making
an
offer
for
that
very
fine
stretch
of
land
about
twenty
acres
is
it
not
which
i
believe
your
corporation
owns
on
the
side
of
the
cemetery
i
should
say
four
hundred
thousand
is
a
most
modest
price
furlong
nodded
his
head
reflectively
you
had
thought
had
you
not
of
offering
it
to
the
city
said
fyshe
we
did
said
furlong
at
a
more
or
less
nominal
sum
four
hundred
thousand
or
whatever
it
might
be
we
felt
that
for
such
a
purpose
almost
sacred
as
it
were
one
would
want
as
little
bargaining
as
possible
oh
none
at
all
assented
fyshe
our
feeling
was
went
on
furlong
that
if
the
city
wanted
our
land
for
the
cemetery
extension
it
might
have
it
at
its
own
figure
four
hundred
thousand
half
a
million
in
fact
at
absolutely
any
price
from
four
hundred
thousand
up
that
they
cared
to
put
on
it
we
did
regard
it
as
a
commercial
transaction
at
all
our
reward
lay
merely
in
the
fact
of
selling
it
to
them
exactly
said
fyshe
and
of
course
your
land
was
more
desirable
from
every
point
of
view
schwefeldampf
ground
is
encumbered
with
a
growth
of
cypress
and
evergreens
and
weeping
willows
which
make
it
quite
unsuitable
for
an
cemetery
whereas
yours
as
i
remember
it
is
bright
and
open
a
loose
sandy
soil
with
no
trees
and
very
little
grass
to
overcome
yes
said
furlong
we
thought
too
that
our
ground
having
the
tanneries
and
the
chemical
factory
along
the
farther
side
of
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
he
paused
seeking
a
mode
of
expressing
his
thought
for
the
dead
said
fyshe
with
becoming
reverence
and
after
this
conversation
fyshe
and
furlong
senior
understood
one
another
absolutely
in
regard
to
the
new
movement
it
was
astonishing
in
fact
how
rapidly
the
light
spread
is
with
us
asked
someone
of
fyshe
a
few
days
later
heart
and
soul
answered
fyshe
he
very
bitter
over
the
way
these
rascals
have
been
plundering
the
city
on
its
coal
supply
he
says
that
the
city
has
been
buying
coal
wholesale
at
the
pit
mouth
at
three
fifty
utterly
worthless
stuff
he
tells
me
he
has
heard
it
said
that
everyone
of
these
scoundrels
has
been
paid
from
to
fifty
dollars
a
winter
to
connive
at
it
dear
me
said
the
listener
abominable
is
it
not
said
fyshe
but
as
i
said
to
what
can
one
do
if
the
citizens
themselves
take
no
interest
in
these
things
your
own
case
i
said
to
him
is
it
that
you
a
coal
man
are
not
helping
the
city
in
this
matter
why
do
you
supply
the
city
he
shook
his
head
would
do
it
at
he
said
i
answered
will
you
at
five
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
i
do
it
at
five
or
at
anything
over
that
they
like
to
name
if
we
get
a
new
council
in
they
may
name
their
own
figure
i
said
hope
all
the
other
businessmen
will
be
animated
with
the
same
spirit
thus
it
was
that
the
light
broke
and
spread
and
illuminated
in
all
directions
people
began
to
realize
the
needs
of
the
city
as
they
never
had
before
boulder
who
owned
among
other
things
a
stone
quarry
and
an
asphalt
company
felt
that
the
paving
of
the
streets
was
a
disgrace
skinyer
of
skinyer
and
beatem
shook
his
head
and
said
that
the
whole
legal
department
of
the
city
needed
reorganization
it
needed
he
said
new
blood
but
he
added
always
in
a
despairing
tone
how
could
one
expect
to
run
a
department
with
the
head
of
it
drawing
only
six
thousand
dollars
the
thing
was
impossible
if
he
argued
they
could
superannuate
the
present
chief
solicitor
and
get
a
man
a
man
skinyer
laid
emphasis
on
this
at
say
fifteen
thousand
there
might
be
some
hope
of
course
said
skinyer
to
newberry
in
discussing
the
topic
one
would
need
to
give
him
a
proper
staff
of
assistants
so
as
to
take
off
his
hands
all
the
work
the
mere
appearance
in
court
the
preparation
of
briefs
the
office
consultation
the
tax
revision
and
the
purely
legal
work
in
that
case
he
would
have
his
hands
free
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
those
things
which
in
fact
to
turn
his
attention
in
whatever
direction
he
might
feel
it
was
advisable
to
turn
it
within
a
week
or
two
the
public
movement
had
found
definite
expression
and
embodied
itself
in
the
clean
government
association
this
was
organized
by
a
group
of
leading
and
disinterested
citizens
who
held
their
first
meeting
in
the
largest
upstairs
room
of
the
mausoleum
club
lucullus
fyshe
boulder
and
others
keenly
interested
in
obtaining
simply
justice
for
the
stockholders
of
the
traction
and
the
citizens
light
were
prominent
from
the
start
furlong
senior
and
others
were
there
not
from
special
interest
in
the
light
or
traction
questions
but
as
they
said
themselves
from
pure
civic
spirit
boomer
was
there
to
represent
the
university
with
three
of
his
most
presentable
professors
cultivated
men
who
were
able
to
sit
in
a
club
and
drink
whiskey
and
soda
and
talk
as
well
as
any
businessman
present
skinyer
beatem
and
others
represented
the
bar
mcteague
blinking
in
the
blue
tobacco
smoke
was
there
to
stand
for
the
church
there
were
enthusiasts
as
well
such
as
newberry
and
the
overend
brothers
and
peter
spillikins
is
it
fine
whispered
spillikins
to
newberry
to
see
a
set
of
men
like
these
all
going
into
a
thing
like
this
not
thinking
of
their
own
interests
a
bit
fyshe
as
chairman
addressed
the
meeting
he
told
them
they
were
there
to
initiate
a
great
free
voluntary
movement
of
the
people
it
had
been
thought
wise
he
said
to
hold
it
with
closed
doors
and
to
keep
it
out
of
the
newspapers
this
would
guarantee
the
league
against
the
old
underhand
control
by
a
clique
that
had
hitherto
disgraced
every
part
of
the
administration
of
the
city
he
wanted
he
said
to
see
everything
done
henceforth
in
broad
daylight
and
for
this
purpose
he
had
summoned
them
there
at
night
to
discuss
ways
and
means
of
action
after
they
were
once
fully
assured
of
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
how
they
meant
to
do
it
the
league
he
said
would
invite
the
fullest
and
freest
advice
from
all
classes
in
the
city
there
were
none
he
said
amid
great
applause
that
were
so
lowly
that
they
would
not
be
invited
once
the
platform
of
the
league
was
settled
to
advise
and
all
might
help
even
the
poorest
subscription
lists
would
be
prepared
which
would
allow
any
sum
at
all
from
one
to
five
dollars
to
be
given
to
the
treasurer
the
league
was
to
be
democratic
or
nothing
the
poorest
might
contribute
as
little
as
one
dollar
even
the
richest
would
not
be
allowed
to
give
more
than
five
moreover
he
gave
notice
that
he
intended
to
propose
that
no
actual
official
of
the
league
should
be
allowed
under
its
to
give
anything
he
himself
if
they
did
him
the
honour
to
make
him
president
as
he
had
heard
it
hinted
was
their
intention
would
be
the
first
to
bow
to
this
rule
he
would
efface
himself
he
would
obliterate
himself
content
in
the
interests
of
all
to
give
nothing
he
was
able
to
announce
similar
pledges
from
his
friends
boulder
furlong
boomer
and
a
number
of
others
quite
a
storm
of
applause
greeted
these
remarks
by
fyshe
who
flushed
with
pride
as
he
heard
it
now
gentlemen
he
went
on
this
meeting
is
open
for
discussion
remember
it
is
quite
informal
anyone
may
speak
i
as
chairman
make
no
claim
to
control
or
monopolize
the
discussion
let
everyone
understand
well
then
chairman
began
dick
overend
one
minute
overend
said
fyshe
i
want
everyone
to
understand
that
he
may
speak
as
may
i
say
then
began
newberry
pardon
me
newberry
said
fyshe
i
was
wishing
first
to
explain
that
not
only
may
participate
but
that
we
in
that
case
began
newberry
before
you
speak
interrupted
fyshe
let
me
add
one
word
we
must
make
our
discussion
as
brief
and
to
the
point
as
possible
i
have
a
great
number
of
things
which
i
wish
to
say
to
the
meeting
and
it
might
be
well
if
all
of
you
would
speak
as
briefly
and
as
little
as
possible
has
anybody
anything
to
say
well
said
newberry
what
about
organization
and
officers
we
have
thought
of
it
said
fyshe
we
were
anxious
above
all
things
to
avoid
the
objectionable
and
corrupt
methods
of
a
and
a
prepared
list
of
officers
which
has
disgraced
every
part
of
our
city
politics
until
the
present
time
boulder
furlong
and
skinyer
and
myself
have
therefore
prepared
a
short
list
of
offices
and
officers
which
we
wish
to
submit
to
your
fullest
freest
consideration
it
runs
thus
hon
president
fyshe
hon
boulder
hon
secretary
furlong
hon
treasurer
skinyer
et
cetera
i
need
read
it
all
you
see
it
posted
in
the
hall
later
is
that
carried
carried
very
good
said
fyshe
there
was
a
moment
pause
while
furlong
and
skinyer
moved
into
seats
beside
fyshe
and
while
furlong
drew
from
his
pocket
and
arranged
the
bundle
of
minutes
of
the
meeting
which
he
had
brought
with
him
as
he
himself
said
he
was
too
neat
and
methodical
a
writer
to
trust
to
jotting
them
down
on
the
spot
do
you
think
said
newberry
i
speak
as
a
practical
man
that
we
ought
to
do
something
to
get
the
newspapers
with
us
most
important
assented
several
members
what
do
you
think
dr
boomer
asked
fyshe
of
the
university
president
will
the
newspapers
be
with
us
boomer
shook
his
head
doubtfully
it
an
important
matter
he
said
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
need
more
than
anything
the
support
of
a
clean
wholesome
unbiassed
press
that
ca
be
bribed
and
is
not
subject
to
money
influence
i
think
on
the
whole
our
best
plan
would
be
to
buy
up
one
of
the
city
newspapers
might
it
not
be
better
simply
to
buy
up
the
editorial
staff
said
dick
overend
we
might
do
that
admitted
boomer
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
corruption
of
the
press
is
one
of
the
worst
factors
that
we
have
to
oppose
but
whether
we
can
best
fight
it
by
buying
the
paper
itself
or
buying
the
staff
is
hard
to
say
suppose
we
leave
it
to
a
committee
with
full
power
to
act
said
fyshe
let
us
direct
them
to
take
whatever
steps
may
in
their
opinion
be
best
calculated
to
elevate
the
tone
of
the
press
the
treasurer
being
authorized
to
second
them
in
every
way
i
for
one
am
heartily
sick
of
old
underhand
connection
between
city
politics
and
the
city
papers
if
we
can
do
anything
to
alter
and
elevate
it
it
will
be
a
fine
work
gentlemen
well
worth
whatever
it
costs
us
thus
after
an
hour
or
two
of
such
discussion
the
clean
government
league
found
itself
organized
and
equipped
with
a
treasury
and
a
programme
and
a
platform
the
latter
was
very
simple
as
fyshe
and
boulder
said
there
was
no
need
to
drag
in
specific
questions
or
try
to
define
the
action
to
be
taken
towards
this
or
that
particular
detail
such
as
the
franchise
beforehand
the
platform
was
simply
expressed
as
honesty
purity
integrity
this
as
fyshe
said
made
a
straight
flat
clean
issue
between
the
league
and
all
who
opposed
it
this
first
meeting
was
of
course
confidential
but
all
that
it
did
was
presently
done
over
again
with
wonderful
freshness
and
spontaneity
at
a
large
public
meeting
open
to
all
citizens
there
was
a
splendid
impromptu
air
about
everything
for
instance
when
somebody
away
back
in
the
hall
said
i
move
that
lucullus
fyshe
be
president
of
the
league
fyshe
lifted
his
hand
in
unavailing
protest
as
if
this
were
the
newest
idea
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
after
all
of
which
the
clean
government
league
set
itself
to
fight
the
cohorts
of
darkness
it
was
not
just
known
where
these
were
but
it
was
understood
that
they
were
there
all
right
somewhere
in
the
platform
speeches
of
the
epoch
they
figured
as
working
underground
working
in
the
dark
working
behind
the
scenes
and
so
forth
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
nobody
could
state
with
any
exactitude
just
who
or
what
it
was
that
the
league
was
fighting
it
stood
for
honesty
purity
and
integrity
that
was
all
you
could
say
about
it
take
for
example
the
case
of
the
press
at
the
inception
of
the
league
it
has
been
supposed
that
such
was
the
venality
and
corruption
of
the
city
newspapers
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
buy
one
of
them
but
the
word
clean
government
had
been
no
sooner
uttered
than
it
turned
out
that
every
one
of
the
papers
in
the
city
was
in
favour
of
it
in
fact
had
been
working
for
it
for
years
they
vied
with
one
another
now
in
giving
publicity
to
the
idea
the
printed
a
dotted
coupon
on
the
corner
of
its
front
sheet
with
the
words
are
you
in
favour
of
clean
government
if
so
send
us
ten
cents
with
this
coupon
and
your
name
and
address
the
citizen
and
home
went
even
further
it
printed
a
coupon
which
said
are
you
out
for
a
clean
city
if
so
send
us
cents
to
this
office
we
pledge
ourselves
to
use
it
the
newspapers
did
more
than
this
they
printed
from
day
to
day
such
pictures
as
the
portrait
of
fyshe
with
the
legend
below
lucullus
fyshe
who
says
that
government
ought
to
be
by
the
people
from
the
people
for
the
people
and
to
the
people
and
the
next
day
another
labelled
spillikins
who
says
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
and
the
next
day
a
picture
with
the
words
tract
of
ground
offered
for
cemetery
by
furlong
showing
rear
of
tanneries
with
head
of
furlong
inserted
it
was
of
course
plain
enough
that
certain
of
the
aldermen
of
the
old
council
were
to
be
reckoned
as
part
of
the
cohort
of
darkness
that
at
least
was
clear
we
want
no
more
men
in
control
of
the
stamp
of
alderman
gorfinkel
and
alderman
schwefeldampf
so
said
practically
every
paper
in
the
city
the
public
sense
revolts
at
these
men
they
are
vultures
who
have
feasted
too
long
on
the
prostrate
corpses
of
our
citizens
and
so
on
the
only
trouble
was
to
discover
who
or
what
had
ever
supported
alderman
gorfinkel
and
alderman
schwefeldampf
the
very
organizations
that
might
have
seemed
to
be
behind
them
were
evidently
more
eager
for
clean
government
than
the
league
itself
the
thomas
jefferson
club
out
for
clean
government
so
ran
the
newspaper
headings
of
one
day
and

the

done

darkness
and
the
day
after
that
sons

kossuth
club
will

with
the
league
so
strong
indeed
was
the
feeling
against
the
iniquitous
aldermen
that
the
public
demand
arose
to
be
done
with
a
council
of
aldermen
altogether
and
to
substitute
government
by
a
board
the
newspapers
contained
editorials
on
the
topic
each
day
and
it
was
understood
that
one
of
the
first
efforts
of
the
league
would
be
directed
towards
getting
the
necessary
sanction
of
the
legislature
in
this
direction
to
help
to
enlighten
the
public
on
what
such
government
meant
professor
proaser
of
the
university
he
was
one
of
the
three
already
referred
to
gave
a
public
lecture
on
the
growth
of
council
government
he
traced
it
from
the
amphictionic
council
of
greece
as
far
down
as
the
oligarchical
council
of
venice
it
was
thought
that
had
the
evening
been
longer
he
would
have
traced
it
clean
down
to
modern
times
but
most
amazing
of
all
was
the
announcement
that
was
presently
made
and
endorsed
by
lucullus
fyshe
in
an
interview
that
mayor
mcgrath
himself
would
favour
clean
government
and
would
become
the
official
nominee
of
the
league
itself
this
certainly
was
strange
but
it
would
perhaps
have
been
less
mystifying
to
the
public
at
large
had
they
been
able
to
listen
to
certain
of
the
intimate
conversations
of
fyshe
and
boulder
you
say
then
said
boulder
to
let
mcgrath
name
stand
we
ca
do
without
him
said
fyshe
he
has
seven
of
the
wards
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
if
we
take
his
offer
he
absolutely
pledges
us
every
one
of
them
can
you
rely
on
his
word
said
boulder
i
think
he
means
to
play
fair
with
us
answered
fyshe
i
put
it
to
him
as
a
matter
of
honour
between
man
and
man
a
week
ago
since
then
i
have
had
him
carefully
dictaphoned
and
i
convinced
playing
straight
how
far
will
he
go
with
us
said
boulder
he
is
willing
to
throw
overboard
gorfinkel
schwefeldampf
and
undercutt
he
says
he
must
find
a
place
for
the
irish
he
says
do
care
for
clean
government
they
want
irish
government
i
see
said
boulder
very
thoughtfully
and
in
regard
to
the
renewal
of
the
franchise
and
the
expropriation
tell
me
just
exactly
what
his
conditions
are
but
fyshe
answer
to
this
was
said
so
discreetly
and
in
such
a
low
voice
that
not
even
the
birds
listening
in
the
elm
trees
outside
the
mausoleum
club
could
hear
it
no
wonder
then
that
if
even
the
birds
failed
to
know
everything
about
the
clean
government
league
there
were
many
things
which
such
good
people
as
newberry
and
peter
spillikins
never
heard
at
all
and
never
guessed
each
week
and
every
day
brought
fresh
triumphs
to
the
onward
march
of
the
movement
yes
gentlemen
said
fyshe
to
the
assembled
committee
of
the
clean
government
league
a
few
days
later
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
report
our
first
victory
boulder
and
i
have
visited
the
state
capital
and
we
are
able
to
tell
you
definitely
that
the
legislature
will
consent
to
change
our
form
of
government
so
as
to
replace
our
council
by
a
board
hear
hear
cried
all
the
committee
men
together
we
saw
the
governor
said
fyshe
indeed
he
was
good
enough
to
lunch
with
us
at
the
pocahontas
club
he
tells
us
that
what
we
are
doing
is
being
done
in
every
city
and
town
of
the
state
he
says
that
the
days
of
the
city
council
are
numbered
they
are
setting
up
boards
everywhere
excellent
said
newberry
the
governor
assures
us
that
what
we
want
will
be
done
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
state
committee
he
was
good
enough
to
dine
with
us
at
the
buchanan
club
has
given
us
the
same
assurance
so
also
does
the
chairman
of
the
republican
state
committee
who
was
kind
enough
to
be
our
guest
in
a
box
at
the
lincoln
theatre
it
is
most
gratifying
concluded
fyshe
to
feel
that
the
legislature
will
give
us
such
a
hearty
such
a
thoroughly
american
support
you
are
sure
of
this
are
you
questioned
newberry
you
have
actually
seen
the
members
of
the
legislature
it
was
not
necessary
said
fyshe
the
governor
and
the
different
chairmen
have
them
so
well
fixed
that
is
to
say
they
have
such
confidence
in
the
governor
and
their
political
organizers
that
they
will
all
be
prepared
to
give
us
what
i
have
described
as
thoroughly
american
support
you
are
quite
sure
persisted
newberry
about
the
governor
and
the
others
you
mentioned
fyshe
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
said
very
quietly
we
are
quite
sure
and
he
exchanged
a
look
with
boulder
that
meant
volumes
to
those
who
would
read
it
i
hope
you
did
mind
my
questioning
you
in
that
fashion
said
newberry
as
he
and
fyshe
strolled
home
from
the
club
the
truth
is
i
did
feel
sure
in
my
own
mind
just
what
was
meant
by
a
and
them
to
give
us
government
by
a
board
i
know
speaking
like
an
ignoramus
i
really
not
paid
as
much
attention
in
the
past
to
civic
politics
as
i
ought
to
have
but
what
is
the
difference
between
a
council
and
a
board
the
difference
between
a
council
and
a
board
repeated
fyshe
yes
said
newberry
the
difference
between
a
council
and
a
board
or
call
it
said
fyshe
reflectively
the
difference
between
a
board
and
a
council
precisely
said
mr
newberry
it
not
altogether
easy
to
explain
said
fyshe
one
chief
difference
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
board
sometimes
called
a
commission
the
salary
is
higher
you
see
the
salary
of
an
alderman
or
councillor
in
most
cities
is
generally
not
more
than
fifteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
dollars
the
salary
of
a
member
of
a
board
or
commission
is
at
least
ten
thousand
that
gives
you
at
once
a
very
different
class
of
men
as
long
as
you
only
pay
fifteen
hundred
you
get
your
council
filled
up
with
men
who
will
do
any
kind
of
crooked
work
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
as
soon
as
you
pay
ten
thousand
you
get
men
with
larger
ideas
i
see
said
newberry
if
you
have
a
fifteen
hundred
dollar
man
fyshe
went
on
you
can
bribe
him
at
any
time
with
a
bill
on
the
other
hand
your
man
has
a
wider
outlook
if
you
offer
him
fifty
dollars
for
his
vote
on
the
board
he
probably
laugh
at
you
ah
yes
said
newberry
i
see
the
idea
a
salary
is
so
low
that
it
will
tempt
a
lot
of
men
into
office
merely
for
what
they
can
get
out
of
it
that
it
exactly
answered
fyshe
from
all
sides
support
came
to
the
new
league
the
women
of
the
city
there
were
fifty
thousand
of
them
on
the
municipal
voters
list
were
not
behind
the
men
though
not
officials
of
the
league
they
rallied
to
its
cause
fyshe
said
buncomhearst
who
called
at
the
office
of
the
president
of
the
league
with
offers
of
support
tell
me
what
we
can
do
i
represent
fifty
thousand
women
voters
of
this
city
this
was
a
favourite
phrase
of
buncomhearst
though
it
had
never
been
made
quite
clear
how
or
why
she
represented
them
we
want
to
help
we
women
you
know
we
any
amount
of
initiative
if
you
only
tell
us
what
to
do
you
know
fyshe
we
just
as
good
executive
ability
as
you
men
if
you
just
tell
us
what
to
do
could
we
hold
a
meeting
of
our
own
all
our
own
to
help
the
league
along
an
excellent
idea
said
fyshe
and
could
you
not
get
three
or
four
men
to
come
and
address
it
so
as
to
stir
us
up
asked
buncomhearst
anxiously
oh
certainly
said
fyshe
so
it
was
known
after
this
that
the
women
were
working
side
by
side
with
the
men
the
tea
rooms
of
the
grand
palaver
and
the
other
hotels
were
filled
with
them
every
day
busy
for
the
cause
one
of
them
even
invented
a
perfectly
charming
election
scarf
to
be
worn
as
a
sort
of
badge
to
show
one
allegiance
and
its
great
merit
was
that
it
was
so
fashioned
that
it
would
go
with
anything
yes
said
fyshe
to
his
committee
one
of
the
finest
signs
of
our
movement
is
that
the
women
of
the
city
are
with
us
whatever
we
may
think
gentlemen
of
the
question
of
woman
rights
in
general
and
i
think
we
know
what
we
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
influence
of
women
makes
for
purity
in
civic
politics
i
am
glad
to
inform
the
committee
that
buncomhearst
and
her
friends
have
organized
all
the
working
women
of
the
city
who
have
votes
they
tell
me
that
they
have
been
able
to
do
this
at
a
cost
as
low
as
five
dollars
per
woman
some
of
the
women
foreigners
of
the
lower
classes
whose
sense
of
political
morality
is
as
yet
imperfectly
developed
have
been
organized
at
a
cost
as
low
as
one
dollar
per
vote
but
of
course
with
our
native
american
women
with
a
higher
standard
of
education
and
morality
we
can
hardly
expect
to
do
it
as
low
as
that
nor
were
the
women
the
only
element
of
support
added
to
the
league
gentlemen
reported
boomer
the
president
of
the
university
at
the
next
committee
meeting
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
spirit
which
animates
us
has
spread
to
the
students
of
the
university
they
have
organized
entirely
by
themselves
and
on
their
own
account
a
fair
play
league
which
has
commenced
its
activities
i
understand
that
they
have
already
ducked
alderman
gorfinkel
in
a
pond
near
the
university
i
believe
they
are
looking
for
alderman
schwefeldampf
tonight
i
understand
they
propose
to
throw
him
into
the
reservoir
the
leaders
of
them
a
splendid
set
of
young
fellows
have
given
me
a
pledge
that
they
will
do
nothing
to
bring
discredit
on
the
university
i
think
i
heard
them
on
the
street
last
night
said
newberry
i
believe
they
had
a
procession
said
the
president
yes
i
heard
them
they
were
shouting
rah
rah
clean
government
clean
government
rah
rah
it
was
really
inspiring
to
hear
them
yes
said
the
president
they
are
banded
together
to
put
down
all
the
hoodlumism
and
disturbance
on
the
street
that
has
hitherto
disgraced
our
municipal
elections
last
night
as
a
demonstration
they
upset
two
streetcars
and
a
milk
wagon
i
heard
that
two
of
them
were
arrested
said
dick
overend
only
by
an
error
said
the
president
there
was
a
mistake
it
was
not
known
that
they
were
students
the
two
who
were
arrested
were
smashing
the
windows
of
the
car
after
it
was
upset
with
their
hockey
sticks
a
squad
of
police
mistook
them
for
rioters
as
soon
as
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station
the
mistake
was
cleared
up
at
once
the
telephoned
an
apology
to
the
university
i
believe
the
league
is
out
again
tonight
looking
for
alderman
schwefeldampf
but
the
leaders
assure
me
there
will
be
no
breach
of
the
peace
whatever
as
i
say
i
think
their
idea
is
to
throw
him
into
the
reservoir
in
the
face
of
such
efforts
as
these
opposition
itself
melted
rapidly
away
the
was
soon
able
to
announce
that
various
undesirable
candidates
were
abandoning
the
field
alderman
gorfinkel
it
said
who
it
will
be
recalled
was
thrown
into
a
pond
last
week
by
the
students
of
the
college
was
still
confined
to
his
bed
when
interviewed
by
our
representative
gorfinkel
stated
that
he
should
not
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
in
the
approaching
election
he
was
he
said
weary
of
civic
honours
he
had
had
enough
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
step
out
and
make
way
for
others
who
deserved
their
turn
as
well
as
himself
in
future
he
proposed
to
confine
his
whole
attention
to
his
misfit
establishment
which
he
was
happy
to
state
was
offering
as
nobby
a
line
of
early
fall
suiting
as
was
ever
seen
at
the
price
there
is
no
need
to
recount
here
in
detail
the
glorious
triumph
of
the
election
day
itself
it
will
always
be
remembered
as
the
purest
cleanest
election
ever
held
in
the
precincts
of
the
city
the
organization
turned
out
in
overwhelming
force
to
guarantee
that
it
should
be
so
bands
of
boomer
students
armed
with
baseball
bats
surrounded
the
polls
to
guarantee
fair
play
any
man
wishing
to
cast
an
unclean
vote
was
driven
from
the
booth
all
those
attempting
to
introduce
any
element
of
brute
force
or
rowdyism
into
the
election
were
cracked
over
the
head
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
scores
of
willing
workers
recruited
often
from
the
humblest
classes
kept
order
with
pickaxes
in
every
part
of
the
city
motor
cars
supplied
by
all
the
leading
businessmen
lawyers
and
doctors
of
the
city
acted
as
patrols
to
see
that
no
unfair
use
should
be
made
of
other
vehicles
in
carrying
voters
to
the
polls
it
was
a
foregone
victory
from
the
first
overwhelming
and
complete
the
cohorts
of
darkness
were
so
completely
routed
that
it
was
practically
impossible
to
find
them
as
it
fell
dusk
the
streets
were
filled
with
roaring
and
surging
crowds
celebrating
the
great
victory
for
clean
government
while
in
front
of
every
newspaper
office
huge
lantern
pictures
of
mcgrath
the
champion
of
pure
and
skinyer
the
people
and
the
other
nominees
of
the
league
called
forth
cheer
after
cheer
of
frenzied
enthusiasm
they
held
that
night
in
celebration
a
great
reception
at
the
mausoleum
club
on
plutoria
avenue
given
at
its
own
suggestion
by
the
city
the
city
indeed
insisted
on
it
nor
was
there
ever
witnessed
even
in
that
home
of
art
and
refinement
a
scene
of
greater
charm
in
the
spacious
corridor
of
the
club
a
hungarian
band
wafted
viennese
music
from
tyrolese
flutes
through
the
rubber
trees
there
was
champagne
bubbling
at
a
score
of
sideboards
where
noiseless
waiters
poured
it
into
goblets
as
broad
and
flat
as
floating
leaves
and
through
it
all
moved
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
of
that
beautiful
arcadia
the
shepherds
in
their
tuxedo
jackets
with
vast
white
broad
as
the
map
of
africa
with
spotless
white
waistcoats
girdling
their
equators
wearing
heavy
gold
and
little
patent
shoes
blacker
than
sin
itself
and
the
shepherdesses
in
foaming
billows
of
silks
of
every
colour
of
the
kaleidoscope
their
hair
bound
with
glittering
headbands
or
coiled
with
white
feathers
the
very
symbol
of
municipal
purity
one
would
search
in
vain
the
pages
of
pastoral
literature
to
find
the
equal
of
it
and
as
they
talked
the
good
news
spread
from
group
to
group
that
it
was
already
known
that
the
new
franchise
of
the
citizens
light
was
to
be
made
for
two
centuries
so
as
to
give
the
company
a
fair
chance
to
see
what
it
could
do
at
the
word
of
it
the
grave
faces
of
manly
bondholders
flushed
with
pride
and
the
soft
eyes
of
listening
shareholders
laughed
back
in
joy
for
they
had
no
doubt
or
fear
now
that
clean
government
had
come
they
knew
what
the
company
could
do
thus
all
night
long
outside
of
the
club
the
soft
note
of
the
motor
horns
arriving
and
departing
wakened
the
sleeping
leaves
of
the
elm
trees
with
their
message
of
good
tidings
and
all
night
long
within
its
lighted
corridors
the
bubbling
champagne
whispered
to
the
listening
rubber
trees
of
the
new
salvation
of
the
city
so
the
night
waxed
and
waned
till
the
slow
day
broke
dimming
with
its
cheap
prosaic
glare
the
shaded
beauty
of
the
artificial
light
and
the
people
of
the
city
the
best
of
them
drove
home
to
their
sleep
and
the
others
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
city
rose
to
their
daily
toil
end
