the
fanatic
caryll
lately
from
rome
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
rainswept
steaming
quays
to
notre
dame
on
the
island
yonder
overhead
rolled
and
crackled
the
artillery
of
an
april
thunderstorm
and
caryll
looking
out
upon
paris
in
her
shroud
of
rain
under
her
pall
of
thundercloud
felt
himself
at
harmony
with
nature
over
his
heart
too
the
gloom
of
storm
was
lowering
just
as
in
his
heart
it
was
still
little
more
than
april
time
behind
him
in
that
chamber
furnished
in
dark
oak
and
leather
of
a
reign
or
two
ago
sat
sir
richard
everard
at
a
vast
all
with
books
and
papers
and
sir
richard
watched
his
adoptive
son
with
fierce
melancholy
eyes
watched
him
until
he
grew
impatient
of
this
pause
well
demanded
the
old
baronet
harshly
will
you
undertake
it
justin
now
that
the
chance
has
come
and
he
added
you
never
hesitate
if
you
are
the
man
i
have
sought
to
make
caryll
turned
slowly
it
is
because
i
am
the
man
that
you
that
god
and
you
have
made
me
that
i
do
his
voice
was
quiet
and
pleasantly
modulated
and
he
spoke
english
with
the
faintest
slur
perceptible
perhaps
only
to
the
keenest
ear
of
a
french
accent
to
ears
less
keen
it
would
merely
seem
that
he
articulated
with
a
precision
so
singular
as
to
verge
on
pedantry
the
light
falling
full
upon
his
profile
revealed
the
rather
singular
countenance
that
was
his
own
it
was
not
in
any
remarkable
beauty
that
its
distinction
lay
for
by
the
canons
of
beauty
that
prevail
it
was
not
beautiful
the
features
were
irregular
and
inclined
to
harshness
the
nose
was
too
abruptly
arched
the
chin
too
long
and
square
the
complexion
too
pallid
yet
a
certain
dignity
haunted
that
youthful
face
of
such
a
quality
as
to
stamp
it
upon
the
memory
of
the
merest
the
mouth
was
difficult
to
read
and
full
of
contradictions
the
lips
were
full
and
red
and
you
would
declare
them
the
lips
of
a
sensualist
but
for
the
line
of
stern
almost
grim
determination
in
which
they
met
and
yet
somewhere
behind
that
grimness
there
appeared
to
lurk
a
haunting
whimsicality
a
smile
seemed
ever
to
impend
but
whether
sweet
or
bitter
none
could
have
told
until
it
broke
the
eyes
were
as
remarkable
and
as
becomes
the
eyes
of
an
observant
man
they
were
of
an
almost
greenish
color
and
so
level
in
their
ordinary
glance
as
to
seem
imbued
with
an
uncanny
penetration
his
hair
he
dared
to
wear
his
own
and
clubbed
it
in
a
broad
ribbon
of
watered
silk
was
almost
of
the
hue
of
bronze
with
here
and
there
a
glint
of
gold
and
as
luxuriant
as
any
wig
for
the
rest
he
was
scarcely
above
the
middle
height
of
an
almost
frail
but
very
graceful
slenderness
and
very
graceful
too
in
all
his
movements
in
dress
he
was
supremely
elegant
with
the
elegance
of
france
that
in
england
would
be
accounted
foppishness
he
wore
a
suit
of
dark
blue
cloth
with
white
satin
linings
that
were
revealed
when
he
moved
it
was
heavily
laced
with
gold
and
a
ramiform
pattern
broidered
in
gold
thread
ran
up
the
sides
of
his
silk
stockings
of
a
paler
blue
jewels
gleamed
in
the
brussels
at
his
throat
and
there
were
diamond
buckles
on
his
lacquered
shoes
sir
richard
considered
him
with
anxiety
and
some
chagrin
justin
he
cried
a
world
of
reproach
in
his
voice
what
can
you
need
to
ponder
whatever
it
may
be
said
caryll
it
will
be
better
that
i
ponder
it
now
than
after
i
have
pledged
but
what
is
it
what
demanded
the
baronet
i
am
marvelling
for
one
thing
that
you
should
have
waited
thirty
sir
richard
fingers
stirred
the
papers
before
him
in
an
idle
absent
manner
into
his
brooding
eyes
there
leapt
the
glitter
to
be
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
fevered
of
body
or
of
mind
vengeance
said
he
slowly
is
a
dish
best
relished
when
is
eaten
he
paused
an
instant
then
continued
i
might
have
crossed
to
england
at
the
time
and
slain
him
should
that
have
satisfied
me
what
is
death
but
peace
and
rest
there
is
a
hell
we
are
told
caryll
reminded
him
ay
was
the
answer
we
are
told
but
i
durs
risk
its
being
false
where
ostermore
is
concerned
so
i
preferred
to
wait
until
i
could
brew
him
such
a
cup
of
bitterness
as
no
man
ever
drank
ere
he
was
glad
to
in
a
quieter
retrospective
voice
he
continued
had
we
prevailed
in
the
i
might
have
found
a
way
to
punish
him
that
had
been
worthy
of
the
crime
that
calls
for
it
we
did
not
prevail
moreover
i
was
taken
and
transported
what
think
you
justin
gave
me
courage
to
endure
the
rigors
of
the
plantations
cunning
and
energy
to
escape
after
five
such
years
of
it
as
had
assuredly
killed
a
stronger
man
less
strong
of
purpose
what
but
the
task
that
was
awaiting
me
it
imported
that
i
should
live
and
be
free
to
call
a
reckoning
in
full
with
my
lord
ostermore
before
i
go
to
my
own
account
opportunity
has
gone
lame
upon
this
journey
but
it
has
arrived
at
last
unless
he
paused
his
voice
sank
from
the
high
note
of
exaltation
to
which
it
had
soared
it
became
charged
with
dread
as
did
the
fierce
eyes
with
which
he
raked
his
companion
face
unless
you
prove
false
to
the
duty
that
awaits
you
and
that
i
not
believe
you
are
your
mother
son
and
my
father
too
answered
justin
in
a
thick
voice
and
the
earl
of
ostermore
is
that
same
the
more
sweetly
shall
your
mother
be
avenged
cried
the
other
and
again
his
eyes
blazed
with
that
unhealthy
fanatical
light
what
fitter
than
the
hand
of
that
poor
lady
son
to
pull
your
father
down
in
ruins
he
laughed
short
and
fiercely
it
seldom
chances
in
this
world
that
justice
is
done
so
you
hate
him
very
deeply
said
caryll
pensively
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
betrayed
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
they
were
of
pity
but
of
pity
at
the
futility
of
such
strong
emotions
as
deeply
as
i
loved
your
mother
the
sharp
rugged
features
of
that
seared
old
face
seemed
of
a
sudden
transfigured
and
softened
the
wild
eyes
lost
some
of
their
glitter
in
a
look
of
wistfulness
as
he
pondered
a
moment
the
one
sweet
memory
in
a
wasted
life
a
life
wrecked
over
thirty
years
ago
wrecked
wantonly
by
that
same
ostermore
of
whom
they
spoke
who
had
been
his
friend
a
groan
broke
from
his
lips
he
took
his
head
in
his
hands
and
elbows
on
the
table
he
sat
very
still
a
moment
reviewing
as
in
a
flash
the
events
of
thirty
and
more
years
ago
when
he
and
viscount
rotherby
as
ostermore
was
then
had
been
young
men
at
the
germain
court
of
james
ii
it
was
on
an
excursion
into
normandy
that
they
had
met
mademoiselle
de
maligny
the
daughter
of
an
impoverished
gentleman
of
the
chetive
noblesse
of
that
province
both
had
loved
her
she
had
preferred
as
women
will
the
outward
handsomeness
of
viscount
rotherby
to
the
sounder
heart
and
brain
that
were
dick
everard
as
bold
and
dominant
as
any
ruffler
of
them
all
where
men
and
perils
were
concerned
young
everard
was
timid
bashful
and
without
assertiveness
with
women
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
contest
ere
it
was
well
lost
leaving
an
easy
victory
to
his
friend
and
how
had
that
friend
used
it
most
foully
as
you
shall
learn
leaving
rotherby
in
normandy
everard
had
returned
to
paris
the
affairs
of
his
king
gave
him
cause
to
cross
at
once
to
ireland
for
three
years
he
abode
there
working
secretly
in
his
master
interest
to
little
purpose
be
it
confessed
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
returned
to
paris
rotherby
was
gone
it
appeared
that
his
father
lord
ostermore
had
prevailed
upon
bentinck
to
use
his
influence
with
william
on
the
errant
youth
behalf
rotherby
had
been
pardoned
his
loyalty
to
the
fallen
dynasty
a
deserter
in
every
sense
he
had
abandoned
the
fortunes
of
king
james
which
in
everard
eyes
was
bad
enough
and
he
had
abandoned
the
sweet
lady
he
had
fetched
out
of
normandy
six
months
before
his
going
of
whom
it
seemed
that
in
his
lordly
way
he
was
grown
tired
from
the
beginning
it
would
appear
they
were
it
was
her
beauty
had
made
appeal
to
him
even
as
his
beauty
had
enamoured
her
elementals
had
brought
about
their
union
and
when
these
elementals
shrank
with
habit
as
elementals
will
they
found
themselves
without
a
tie
of
sympathy
or
common
interest
to
link
them
each
to
the
other
she
was
by
nature
blythe
a
thing
of
sunshine
flowers
and
music
who
craved
a
very
poet
for
her
lover
and
by
a
poet
i
mean
not
your
mere
rhymer
he
was
downright
stolid
and
stupid
under
his
fine
exterior
the
worst
type
of
briton
without
the
saving
grace
of
a
briton
honor
and
so
she
had
wearied
him
who
saw
in
her
no
more
than
a
sweet
loveliness
that
had
cloyed
him
presently
and
when
the
chance
was
offered
him
by
bentinck
and
his
father
he
took
it
and
went
his
ways
and
this
sweet
flower
that
he
had
plucked
from
its
normandy
garden
to
adorn
him
for
a
brief
summer
day
was
left
to
wilt
discarded
the
tale
that
greeted
everard
on
his
return
from
ireland
was
that
she
had
died
crushed
neath
her
load
of
shame
for
it
was
said
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
the
rumor
of
her
death
had
gone
abroad
and
it
had
been
carried
to
england
and
my
lord
rotherby
by
a
cousin
of
hers
the
last
living
maligny
who
crossed
the
channel
to
demand
of
that
stolid
gentleman
satisfaction
for
the
dishonor
put
upon
his
house
all
the
satisfaction
the
poor
fellow
got
was
a
foot
or
so
of
steel
through
the
lungs
of
which
he
died
and
there
may
it
have
seemed
to
rotherby
the
matter
ended
but
everard
remained
everard
who
had
loved
her
with
a
great
and
almost
sacred
love
everard
who
swore
black
ruin
for
my
lord
rotherby
the
rumor
of
which
may
also
have
been
carried
to
his
lordship
and
stimulated
his
activities
in
having
everard
hunted
down
after
the
braemar
fiasco
of
but
before
that
came
to
pass
everard
had
discovered
that
the
rumor
of
her
death
was
false
put
about
no
doubt
out
of
fear
of
that
same
cousin
who
had
made
himself
champion
and
avenger
of
her
honor
everard
sought
her
out
and
found
her
perishing
of
want
in
an
attic
in
the
cour
des
miracles
some
four
months
later
eight
months
after
desertion
in
that
sordid
chamber
of
paris
most
abandoned
haunt
a
son
had
been
born
to
antoinette
de
maligny
two
days
before
everard
had
come
upon
her
both
were
dying
both
had
assuredly
died
within
the
week
but
that
he
came
so
timely
to
her
aid
and
that
aid
he
rendered
like
the
gentleman
he
was
he
had
contrived
to
save
his
fortune
from
the
wreck
of
james
kingship
and
this
was
safely
invested
in
france
in
holland
and
elsewhere
abroad
with
a
portion
of
it
he
repurchased
the
chateau
and
estates
of
maligny
which
on
the
death
of
antoinette
father
had
been
seized
upon
by
creditors
thither
he
sent
her
and
her
child
rotherby
child
making
that
noble
domain
a
to
the
boy
for
whom
he
had
stood
sponsor
at
the
font
and
he
did
his
work
of
love
in
the
background
he
was
the
god
in
the
machine
no
more
no
single
opportunity
of
thanking
him
did
he
afford
her
he
effaced
himself
that
she
might
not
see
the
sorrow
she
occasioned
him
lest
it
should
increase
her
own
for
two
years
she
dwelt
at
maligny
in
such
peace
as
the
may
know
the
little
of
life
that
was
left
her
irradiated
by
noble
friendship
he
wrote
to
her
from
time
to
time
now
from
italy
now
from
holland
but
he
never
came
to
visit
her
a
delicacy
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
false
restrained
him
and
she
respecting
what
instinctively
she
knew
to
be
his
feelings
never
bade
him
come
to
her
in
their
letters
they
never
spoke
of
rotherby
not
once
did
his
name
pass
between
them
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
lived
or
never
crossed
their
lives
meanwhile
she
weakened
and
faded
day
by
day
despite
all
the
care
with
which
she
was
surrounded
that
winter
of
cold
and
want
in
the
cour
des
miracles
had
sown
its
seeds
and
death
was
sharpening
his
scythe
against
the
harvest
when
the
end
was
come
she
sent
urgently
for
everard
he
came
at
once
in
answer
to
her
summons
but
he
came
too
late
she
died
the
evening
before
he
arrived
but
she
had
left
a
letter
written
days
before
against
the
chance
of
his
not
reaching
her
before
the
end
that
letter
in
her
fine
french
hand
was
before
him
now
i
will
not
try
to
thank
you
dearest
friend
she
wrote
for
the
thing
that
you
have
done
what
payment
is
there
in
poor
thanks
oh
everard
everard
had
it
but
pleased
god
to
have
helped
me
to
a
wiser
choice
when
it
was
mine
to
choose
she
cried
to
him
from
that
letter
and
poor
everard
deemed
that
the
thin
ray
of
joy
her
words
sent
through
his
anguished
soul
was
payment
more
than
enough
for
the
little
that
he
had
done
god
will
be
done
she
continued
it
is
his
will
he
knows
why
it
is
best
so
though
we
discern
it
not
but
there
is
the
boy
there
is
justin
i
bequeath
him
to
you
who
already
have
done
so
much
for
him
love
him
a
little
for
my
sake
cherish
and
rear
him
as
your
own
and
make
of
him
such
a
gentleman
as
are
you
his
father
does
not
so
much
as
know
of
his
existence
that
too
is
best
so
for
i
would
not
have
him
claim
my
boy
never
let
him
learn
that
justin
exists
unless
it
be
to
punish
him
by
the
knowledge
for
his
cruel
desertion
of
choking
the
writing
blurred
by
tears
that
he
accounted
no
disgrace
to
his
young
manhood
everard
had
sworn
in
that
hour
that
justin
should
be
as
a
son
to
him
he
would
do
her
will
and
he
set
upon
it
a
more
definite
meaning
than
she
intended
rotherby
should
remain
in
ignorance
of
his
son
existence
until
such
season
as
should
make
the
knowledge
a
very
anguish
to
him
he
would
rear
justin
in
bitter
hatred
of
the
foul
villain
who
had
been
his
father
and
with
the
boy
help
when
the
time
should
be
ripe
he
would
lay
my
lord
rotherby
in
ruins
thus
should
my
lord
sin
come
to
find
him
out
this
everard
had
sworn
and
this
he
had
done
he
had
told
justin
the
story
almost
as
soon
as
justin
was
of
an
age
to
understand
it
he
had
repeated
it
at
very
frequent
intervals
and
as
the
lad
grew
everard
watched
in
him
fostering
it
by
every
means
in
his
power
the
growth
of
his
execration
for
the
author
of
his
days
and
of
his
reverence
for
the
sweet
departed
saint
that
had
been
his
mother
for
the
rest
he
had
lavished
justin
nobly
for
his
mother
sake
the
repurchased
estates
of
maligny
with
their
handsome
rent
roll
remained
justin
own
administered
by
sir
richard
during
the
lad
minority
and
vastly
enriched
by
the
care
of
that
administration
he
had
sent
the
lad
to
oxford
and
afterwards
the
more
thoroughly
to
complete
his
education
on
a
two
years
tour
of
europe
and
on
his
return
a
grown
and
cultured
man
he
had
attached
him
to
the
court
in
rome
of
the
pretender
whose
agent
he
was
himself
in
paris
he
had
done
his
duty
by
the
boy
as
he
understood
his
duty
always
with
that
grim
purpose
of
revenge
for
his
horizon
and
the
result
had
been
a
stranger
compound
than
even
everard
knew
for
all
that
he
knew
the
lad
exceedingly
well
for
he
had
scarcely
reckoned
sufficiently
upon
justin
mixed
nationality
and
the
circumstance
that
in
soul
and
mind
he
was
entirely
his
mother
child
with
nothing
or
an
imperceptible
little
of
his
father
as
his
mother
nature
had
been
so
was
justin
joyous
but
everard
training
of
him
had
suppressed
all
inborn
vivacity
the
mirth
and
diablerie
that
were
his
birthright
had
been
overlaid
with
british
phlegm
until
in
their
stead
and
through
the
blend
a
certain
sardonic
humor
had
developed
an
ironical
attitude
toward
all
things
whether
sacred
or
profane
this
had
been
helped
on
by
culture
and
in
a
still
greater
measure
by
the
odd
training
in
worldliness
which
he
had
from
everard
his
illusions
were
shattered
ere
he
had
cut
his
wisdom
teeth
thanks
to
the
tutelage
of
sir
richard
who
in
giving
him
the
ugly
story
of
his
own
existence
taught
him
the
misanthropical
lesson
that
all
men
are
knaves
all
women
fools
he
developed
as
a
consequence
that
sardonic
outlook
upon
the
world
he
sought
to
take
vos
non
vobis
for
his
motto
affected
to
a
spectator
in
the
theatre
of
life
with
the
obvious
result
that
he
became
the
greatest
actor
of
them
all
so
we
find
him
even
now
his
main
emotion
pity
for
sir
richard
who
sat
silent
for
some
moments
reviewing
that
dead
past
until
the
tears
scalded
his
old
eyes
the
baronet
made
a
queer
noise
in
his
throat
something
between
a
snarl
and
a
sob
and
he
flung
himself
suddenly
back
in
his
chair
justin
sat
down
a
becoming
gravity
in
his
countenance
tell
me
all
he
begged
his
adoptive
father
tell
me
how
matters
stand
precisely
how
you
propose
to
with
all
my
heart
the
baronet
assented
lord
ostermore
having
turned
his
coat
once
for
profit
is
ready
now
to
turn
it
again
for
the
same
end
from
the
information
that
reaches
me
from
england
it
would
appear
that
in
the
rage
of
speculation
that
has
been
toward
in
london
his
lordship
has
suffered
heavily
how
heavily
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
but
heavily
enough
i
dare
swear
to
have
caused
this
offer
to
return
to
his
king
for
he
looks
no
doubt
to
sell
his
services
at
a
price
that
will
help
him
mend
the
wreckage
of
his
fortunes
a
week
ago
a
gentleman
who
goes
between
his
majesty
court
at
rome
and
his
friends
here
in
paris
brought
me
word
from
his
majesty
that
ostermore
had
signified
to
him
his
willingness
to
rejoin
the
stuart
cause
together
with
that
information
this
messenger
brought
me
letters
from
his
majesty
to
several
of
his
friends
which
i
was
to
send
to
england
by
a
safe
hand
at
the
first
opportunity
now
amongst
these
letters
delivered
to
me
unsealed
is
one
to
my
lord
ostermore
making
him
certain
advantageous
proposals
which
he
is
sure
to
accept
if
his
circumstances
be
as
crippled
as
i
am
given
to
understand
atterbury
and
his
friends
it
seems
have
already
tampered
with
my
lord
loyalty
to
dutch
george
to
some
purpose
and
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
this
letter
and
he
tapped
a
document
before
him
will
do
what
else
is
to
be
done
but
since
these
letters
were
left
with
me
come
you
with
his
fresh
injunctions
that
i
am
to
suppress
them
and
cross
to
england
at
once
myself
to
prevail
upon
atterbury
and
his
associates
to
abandon
the
caryll
nodded
because
as
i
have
told
you
said
he
king
james
in
rome
has
received
positive
information
that
in
london
the
plot
is
already
suspected
little
though
atterbury
may
dream
it
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
my
lord
ostermore
this
said
everard
slowly
leaning
across
toward
justin
and
laying
a
hand
upon
his
sleeve
i
am
to
counsel
the
bishop
to
stay
his
hand
against
a
more
favorable
opportunity
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
do
the
very
opposite
with
caryll
knit
his
brows
his
eyes
intent
upon
the
other
face
but
he
said
no
word
it
is
urged
everard
an
opportunity
such
as
there
may
never
be
another
we
destroy
ostermore
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
we
bring
him
to
the
he
chuckled
over
the
word
with
a
joy
almost
diabolical
but
how
how
do
we
destroy
him
quoth
justin
who
suspected
yet
dared
not
encourage
his
suspicions
how
do
you
ask
how
not
plain
snapped
sir
richard
and
what
he
avoided
putting
into
words
his
eloquent
glance
made
clear
to
his
companion
caryll
rose
a
thought
quickly
a
faint
flush
stirring
in
his
cheeks
and
he
threw
off
everard
grasp
with
a
gesture
that
was
almost
of
repugnance
you
mean
that
i
am
to
enmesh
him
sir
richard
smiled
grimly
as
his
majesty
accredited
agent
he
explained
i
will
equip
you
with
papers
word
shall
go
ahead
of
you
to
ostermore
by
a
safe
hand
to
bid
him
look
for
the
coming
of
a
messenger
bearing
his
own
family
name
no
more
than
that
nothing
that
can
betray
us
yet
enough
to
whet
his
lordship
appetite
you
shall
be
the
ambassador
to
bear
him
the
tempting
offers
from
the
king
you
will
obtain
his
answers
accepting
those
you
will
deliver
to
me
and
i
shall
do
the
trifle
that
may
still
be
needed
to
set
the
rope
about
his
a
little
while
there
was
silence
outside
the
rain
driven
by
gusts
smote
the
window
as
with
a
scourge
the
thunder
was
grumbling
in
the
distance
now
caryll
resumed
his
chair
he
sat
very
thoughtful
but
with
no
emotion
showing
in
his
face
british
stolidity
was
in
the
ascendant
with
him
then
he
felt
that
he
had
the
need
of
it
it
is
ugly
he
said
at
last
slowly
it
is
god
own
will
was
the
hot
answer
and
sir
richard
smote
the
table
has
god
taken
you
into
his
confidence
wondered
caryll
i
know
that
god
is
yet
is
it
not
written
that
is
his
own
aye
but
he
needs
human
instruments
to
execute
it
such
instruments
are
we
can
you
oh
can
you
hesitate
caryll
clenched
his
hands
hard
do
it
he
answered
through
set
teeth
do
it
i
shall
approve
it
when
is
done
but
find
other
hands
for
the
work
sir
richard
he
is
my
sir
richard
remained
cool
that
is
the
argument
i
employ
for
insisting
upon
the
task
being
yours
he
replied
then
in
a
blaze
of
passion
he
who
had
schooled
his
adoptive
son
so
ably
in
marshalled
once
more
his
arguments
it
is
your
duty
to
your
mother
to
forget
that
he
is
your
father
think
of
him
only
as
the
man
who
wronged
your
mother
the
man
to
whom
her
ruined
life
her
early
death
are
due
her
murderer
and
worse
consider
that
your
father
you
say
he
mocked
almost
your
father
in
what
is
he
your
father
you
have
never
seen
him
he
does
not
know
that
you
exist
that
you
ever
existed
is
that
to
be
a
father
father
you
say
a
word
a
name
no
more
than
that
a
name
that
gives
rise
to
a
sentiment
and
a
sentiment
is
to
stand
between
you
and
your
clear
duty
a
sentiment
is
to
set
a
protecting
shield
over
the
man
who
killed
your
mother
i
think
i
shall
despise
you
justin
if
you
fail
me
in
this
i
have
lived
for
it
he
ran
on
tempestuously
i
have
reared
you
for
it
and
you
shall
not
fail
me
then
his
voice
dropped
again
and
in
quieter
tones
you
hate
the
very
name
of
john
caryll
earl
of
ostermore
said
he
as
must
every
decent
man
who
knows
the
truth
of
what
the
life
of
that
satyr
holds
if
i
have
suffered
you
to
bear
his
name
it
is
to
the
end
that
it
should
remind
you
daily
that
you
have
no
right
to
it
that
you
have
no
right
to
any
when
he
said
that
he
thrust
his
finger
consciously
into
a
raw
wound
he
saw
justin
wince
and
with
pitiless
cunning
he
continued
to
prod
that
tender
place
until
he
had
aggravated
the
smart
of
it
into
a
very
agony
that
is
what
you
owe
your
father
that
is
the
full
extent
of
what
lies
between
you
that
you
are
of
those
at
whom
the
world
is
given
to
sneer
and
point
scorn
ready
none
has
ever
dared
said
caryll
because
none
has
ever
known
we
have
kept
the
secret
well
you
display
no
coat
of
arms
that
no
bar
sinister
may
be
displayed
but
the
time
may
come
when
the
secret
must
out
you
might
for
instance
think
of
marrying
a
lady
of
quality
a
lady
of
your
own
supposed
station
what
shall
you
tell
her
of
yourself
that
you
have
no
name
to
offer
her
that
the
name
you
bear
is
yours
by
assumption
only
ah
that
brings
home
your
own
wrongs
to
you
justin
consider
them
have
them
ever
present
in
your
mind
together
with
your
mother
blighted
life
that
you
may
not
shrink
when
the
hour
strikes
to
punish
the
he
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
again
and
watched
the
younger
man
with
brooding
eye
caryll
was
plainly
moved
he
had
paled
a
little
and
he
sat
now
with
brows
contracted
and
set
teeth
sir
richard
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
recapitulating
he
is
your
mother
destroyer
he
said
with
a
sad
sternness
is
the
ruin
of
that
fair
life
to
go
unpunished
is
it
justin
caryll
gallic
spirit
burst
abruptly
through
its
british
glaze
he
crushed
fist
into
palm
and
swore
no
by
god
it
shall
not
sir
richard
sir
richard
held
out
his
hands
and
there
was
a
fierce
joy
in
his
gloomy
eyes
at
last
you
cross
to
england
with
me
justin
but
caryll
soul
fell
once
more
into
travail
wait
he
cried
ah
wait
his
level
glance
met
sir
richard
in
earnestness
and
entreaty
answer
me
the
truth
upon
your
soul
and
conscience
do
you
in
your
heart
believe
that
it
is
what
my
mother
would
have
had
me
do
there
was
an
instant
pause
then
everard
the
fanatic
of
vengeance
the
man
whose
mind
upon
that
one
subject
was
become
unsound
with
excess
of
brooding
answered
with
conviction
as
i
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
justin
i
do
believe
it
more
i
know
it
here
trembling
hands
took
up
the
old
letter
from
the
table
and
proffered
it
to
justin
here
is
her
own
message
to
you
read
it
and
what
time
the
young
man
eyes
rested
upon
that
fine
pointed
writing
sir
richard
recited
aloud
the
words
he
knew
by
heart
the
words
that
had
been
ringing
in
his
ears
since
that
day
when
he
had
seen
her
lowered
to
rest
let
him
learn
that
justin
exists
unless
it
be
to
punish
him
by
the
knowledge
for
his
cruel
desertion
of
me
it
is
your
mother
voice
speaking
to
you
from
the
grave
the
fanatic
pursued
and
so
infected
justin
at
last
with
something
of
his
fanaticism
the
green
eyes
flashed
uncannily
the
white
young
face
grew
cruelly
sardonic
you
believe
it
he
asked
and
the
eagerness
that
now
invested
his
voice
showed
how
it
really
was
with
him
as
i
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
sir
richard
repeated
then
gladly
will
i
set
my
hand
to
fire
stirred
through
justin
now
a
fire
of
righteous
passion
an
idea
no
more
than
an
idea
daunted
me
you
have
shown
me
that
i
cross
to
england
with
you
sir
richard
and
let
my
lord
ostermore
look
to
himself
for
my
name
i
who
have
no
right
to
any
name
my
name
is
judgment
the
exaltation
fell
from
him
as
suddenly
as
it
had
mounted
he
dropped
into
a
chair
thoughtful
again
and
slightly
ashamed
of
his
sudden
outburst
sir
richard
everard
watched
with
an
eye
of
gloomy
joy
the
man
whom
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
school
in
overhead
there
was
a
sudden
crackle
of
thunder
sharp
and
staccato
as
a
peal
of
demoniac
laughter
chapter
ii
at
the
adam
and
eve
caryll
alighted
from
his
traveling
chaise
in
the
yard
of
the
adam
and
eve
at
maidstone
on
a
sunny
afternoon
in
may
landed
at
dover
the
night
before
he
had
parted
company
with
sir
richard
everard
that
morning
his
adoptive
father
had
turned
aside
toward
rochester
to
discharge
his
king
business
with
plotting
bishop
atterbury
what
time
justin
was
to
push
on
toward
town
as
king
james
ambassador
to
the
earl
of
ostermore
who
advised
of
his
coming
was
expecting
him
here
at
maidstone
it
was
caryll
intent
to
dine
resuming
his
journey
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
he
hoped
to
get
at
least
as
far
as
farnborough
ere
he
slept
landlady
chamberlain
ostler
and
a
posse
of
underlings
hastened
to
give
welcome
to
so
fine
a
gentleman
and
a
private
room
was
placed
at
his
disposal
before
ascending
however
caryll
sauntered
into
the
bar
for
a
whetting
glass
to
give
him
an
appetite
and
further
for
the
purpose
of
bespeaking
in
detail
his
dinner
with
the
hostess
it
was
one
of
his
traits
that
he
gave
the
greatest
attention
to
detail
and
held
that
the
man
who
left
the
ordering
of
his
edibles
to
his
servants
was
no
better
than
an
animal
who
saw
no
more
than
nourishment
in
food
nor
was
the
matter
one
to
be
settled
summarily
it
asked
thought
and
time
so
he
sipped
his
hock
listening
to
the
landlady
proposals
and
amending
them
where
necessary
with
suggestions
of
his
own
and
what
time
he
was
so
engaged
there
ambled
into
the
inn
yard
a
sturdy
cob
bearing
a
sturdy
little
man
in
clothes
that
had
seen
some
wear
the
newcomer
threw
his
reins
to
the
a
person
of
all
the
importance
necessary
to
receive
so
indifferent
a
guest
he
got
down
nimbly
from
his
horse
produced
an
enormous
handkerchief
of
many
colors
and
removed
his
hat
that
he
might
the
better
mop
his
brow
and
youthful
almost
cherubic
face
what
time
he
did
so
a
pair
of
bright
little
blue
eyes
were
very
busy
with
caryll
carriage
from
which
leduc
caryll
valet
was
in
the
act
of
removing
a
portmantle
his
mobile
mouth
fell
into
lines
of
satisfaction
still
mopping
himself
he
entered
the
inn
and
guided
by
the
drone
of
voices
sauntered
into
the
bar
at
sight
of
caryll
leaning
there
his
little
eyes
beamed
an
instant
as
do
the
eyes
of
one
who
espies
a
friend
or
apter
figure
the
eyes
of
the
hunter
when
they
sight
the
quarry
he
advanced
to
the
bar
bowing
to
caryll
with
an
air
almost
apologetic
and
to
the
landlady
with
an
air
scarcely
less
so
as
he
asked
for
a
nipperkin
of
ale
to
wash
the
dust
of
the
road
from
his
throat
the
hostess
called
a
drawer
to
serve
him
and
departed
herself
upon
the
momentous
business
of
caryll
dinner
a
warm
day
sir
said
the
chubby
man
caryll
agreed
with
him
politely
and
finished
his
glass
the
other
sipping
meanwhile
at
his
ale
a
fine
brew

said
he
a
prodigious
fine
brew
with
all
respect

your
honor
should
try
a
whet
of
our
english
caryll
setting
down
his
glass
looked
languidly
at
the
man
why
do
you
exclude
me
sir
from
the
nation
of
this
beverage
he
inquired
the
chubby
man
face
expressed
astonishment
ye
english
sir
ecod
i
had
thought
ye
french
it
is
an
honor
sir
that
you
should
have
thought
me
the
other
abased
himself
was
an
unwarrantable
presumption
codso
which
i
hope
your
honor
then
he
smiled
again
his
little
eyes
twinkling
humorously
an
ye
would
try
the
ale
i
dare
swear
your
honor
would
forgive
me
i
know
ale
ecod
i
am
a
brewer
myself
green

my
name
sir
tom
green
your
very
obedient
servant
and
he
drank
as
if
pledging
that
same
service
he
professed
caryll
observed
him
calmly
and
a
thought
indifferently
determined
to
honor
me
said
he
i
am
your
debtor
for
your
reflections
upon
whetting
glasses
but
ale
sir
is
a
beverage
i
do
affect
nor
shall
while

are
vines
in
ah
sighed
green
rapturously

a
great
country
france

it
not
sir

not
the
general
opinion
here
at
present
but
i
make
no
doubt
that
it
deserves
your
and
paris

persisted
green
they
tell
me

a
great
city
a
marvel
o
th
ages
there

those
ecod
that
say
london
but
a
kennel
be
there
so
quoth
caryll
indifferently
ye
do
agree
with
them
belike
asked
green
with
eagerness
pooh
men
will
say
anything
caryll
replied
and
added
pointedly
men
will
talk
ye
not
always
was
the
retort
in
a
sly
tone
i
known
men
to
be
prodigious
short
when
they
had
aught
to
have
ye
so
ye
seem
to
have
had
a
wide
and
caryll
sauntered
out
humming
a
french
air
through
closed
lips
green
looked
after
him
with
hardened
eyes
he
turned
to
the
drawer
who
stood
by
he
mighty
close
said
he
mighty
close
ye
not
perhaps
quite
the
company
he
cares
for
the
drawer
suggested
candidly
green
looked
at
him
very
like
he
snapped
how
long
does
he
stay
here
ye
lost
a
rare
chance
of
finding
out
when
ye
let
him
go
without
inquiring
said
the
drawer
green
face
lost
some
of
its
chubbiness
when
d
look
to
marry
the
landlady
was
his
next
question
the
man
stared
cod
said
he
marry
the
are
ye
daft
green
affected
surprise
i
mistook
it
seems
ye
misled
me
by
your
pertness
get
me
another
meanwhile
caryll
had
taken
his
way
above
stairs
to
the
room
set
apart
for
him
he
dined
to
his
satisfaction
and
thereafter
his
shapely
legs
thrown
over
a
second
chair
his
waistcoat
all
unbuttoned
for
the
day
was
of
an
almost
midsummer
warmth
he
sat
mightily
at
his
ease
a
decanter
of
sherry
at
his
elbow
a
pipe
in
one
hand
and
a
book
of
mr
gay
poems
in
the
other
but
the
ease
went
no
further
than
the
body
as
witnessed
the
circumstances
that
his
pipe
was
cold
the
decanter
tolerably
full
and
mr
gay
pleasant
rhymes
and
quaint
conceits
of
fancy
all
unheeded
the
light
mercurial
spirit
which
he
had
from
nature
and
his
unfortunate
mother
and
which
he
had
retained
in
spite
of
the
stern
training
he
had
received
at
his
adoptive
hands
was
now
the
mild
fatigue
of
his
journey
through
the
heat
of
the
day
had
led
him
to
look
forward
to
a
voluptuous
hour
of
indolence
following
upon
dinner
with
pipe
and
book
and
glass
the
hour
was
come
the
elements
were
there
but
since
he
could
not
abandon
himself
to
their
dominion
the
voluptuousness
was
wanting
the
task
before
him
haunted
him
with
anticipatory
remorse
it
hung
upon
his
spirit
like
a
sick
man
dream
it
obtruded
itself
upon
his
constant
thought
and
the
more
he
pondered
it
the
more
did
he
sicken
at
what
lay
before
him
wrought
upon
by
everard
fanaticism
that
day
in
paris
some
three
weeks
ago
infected
for
the
time
being
by
something
of
his
adoptive
fever
he
had
set
his
hands
to
the
task
in
a
glow
of
passionate
exaltation
but
with
the
hour
the
exaltation
went
and
reaction
started
in
his
soul
and
yet
draw
back
he
dared
not
too
long
and
sedulously
had
everard
trained
his
spirit
to
look
upon
the
avenging
of
his
mother
as
a
duty
believing
that
it
was
his
duty
he
thirsted
on
the
one
hand
to
fulfill
it
whilst
on
the
other
he
recoiled
in
horror
at
the
thought
that
the
man
upon
whom
he
was
to
wreak
that
vengeance
was
his
father
albeit
a
father
whom
he
did
not
know
who
had
never
seen
him
who
was
not
so
much
as
aware
of
his
existence
he
sought
forgetfulness
in
mr
gay
he
had
the
inherent
taste
for
verse
a
quick
ear
for
the
melody
of
words
the
aesthete
love
of
beauty
in
phrase
as
of
beauty
in
all
else
and
culture
had
quickened
his
perceptions
developed
his
capacity
for
appreciation
for
the
tenth
time
he
called
leduc
to
light
his
pipe
and
that
done
he
set
his
eye
to
the
page
once
more
but
it
was
like
harnessing
a
bullock
to
a
cart
unmindful
of
the
way
it
went
and
over
what
it
travelled
his
eye
ambled
heavily
along
the
lines
and
when
he
came
to
turn
the
page
he
realized
with
a
start
that
he
had
no
impression
of
what
he
had
read
upon
it
in
sheer
disgust
he
tossed
the
book
aside
and
kicking
away
the
second
chair
rose
lythely
he
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
there
gazing
out
at
nothing
nor
conscious
of
the
incense
that
came
to
him
from
garden
from
orchard
and
from
meadow
it
needed
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
a
cloud
of
dust
approaching
from
the
north
to
draw
his
mind
from
its
obsessing
thoughts
he
watched
the
yellow
body
of
the
coach
as
it
came
furiously
onward
its
four
horses
stretched
to
the
gallop
postillion
lusty
of
lungs
and
whip
and
the
great
trail
of
dust
left
behind
it
spreading
to
right
and
left
over
the
flowering
to
lose
itself
above
the
meadowland
on
it
came
to
draw
up
there
at
the
very
entrance
to
maidstone
at
the
sign
of
the
adam
and
caryll
leaning
on
the
sill
of
his
window
looked
down
with
interest
to
see
what
manner
of
travellers
were
these
that
went
at
so
a
pace
from
the
rumble
a
lackey
swung
himself
to
the
rough
cobbles
of
the
yard
from
within
the
inn
came
again
landlady
and
chamberlain
and
from
the
stable
ostler
and
boy
obsequious
all
and
of
no
interest
to
caryll
then
the
door
of
the
coach
was
opened
the
steps
were
let
down
and
there
emerged
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
servant
a
very
ferret
of
a
man
in
black
with
a
parson
bands
and
neckcloth
a
wig
and
under
this
a
white
face
rather
drawn
and
haggard
and
thin
lips
perpetually
agrin
to
flaunt
two
rows
of
yellow
teeth
disproportionately
large
after
him
and
the
more
remarkable
by
contrast
came
a
tall
fellow
very
brave
in
cloth
with
a
fortune
in
lace
at
wrist
and
throat
and
a
heavily
powdered
lackey
chamberlain
and
parson
attended
his
alighting
and
then
he
joined
their
ranks
to
attend
in
his
turn
hat
under
arm
the
last
of
these
odd
travellers
the
interest
grew
caryll
felt
that
the
climax
was
about
to
be
presented
and
he
leaned
farther
forward
that
he
might
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
awaited
personage
in
the
silence
he
caught
a
rustle
of
silk
a
flowered
petticoat
appeared
as
much
of
it
as
may
be
seen
from
the
knee
downwards
and
from
beneath
this
the
daintiest
foot
conceivable
was
seen
to
grope
an
instant
for
the
step
another
second
and
the
rest
of
her
emerged
caryll
observed
and
be
it
known
that
he
had
the
very
shrewdest
eye
for
a
woman
as
became
one
of
the
race
from
which
on
his
mother
side
he
sprang
that
she
was
middling
tall
chastely
slender
having
as
he
judged
from
her
high
waist
a
fine
clean
length
of
limb
all
this
he
observed
and
approved
and
prayed
for
a
glimpse
of
the
face
which
her
silken
hood
obscured
and
screened
from
his
desiring
gaze
she
raised
it
at
that
moment
raised
it
in
a
timid
frightened
fashion
as
one
who
looks
fearfully
about
to
see
that
she
is
not
remarked
and
caryll
had
a
glimpse
of
an
oval
face
pale
with
a
warm
pallor
like
the
pallor
of
the
peach
he
thought
and
touched
like
the
peach
with
a
faint
hint
of
pink
in
either
cheek
a
pair
of
eyes
large
brown
and
gentle
as
a
saint
met
his
and
caryll
realized
that
she
was
beautiful
and
that
it
might
be
good
to
look
into
those
eyes
at
closer
quarters
seeing
him
a
faint
exclamation
escaped
her
and
she
turned
away
in
sudden
haste
to
enter
the
inn
the
fine
gentleman
looked
up
and
scowled
the
parson
looked
up
and
trembled
the
ostler
and
his
boy
looked
up
and
grinned
then
all
swept
forward
and
were
screened
by
the
porch
from
the
wondering
eyes
of
caryll
he
turned
from
the
window
with
a
sigh
and
stepped
back
to
the
table
for
the
that
for
the
eleventh
time
he
might
relight
his
pipe
he
sat
down
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
to
the
ceiling
and
considered
his
nature
triumphed
now
over
his
recent
preoccupation
the
matter
of
the
moment
which
concerned
him
not
at
all
engrossed
him
beyond
any
other
matter
of
his
life
he
was
intrigued
to
know
in
what
relation
one
to
the
other
stood
the
three
so
oddly
assorted
travellers
he
had
seen
arrive
he
bethought
him
that
after
all
the
odd
assortment
arose
from
the
presence
of
the
parson
and
he
wondered
what
the
plague
should
any
christian
and
seemingly
a
gentleman
at
that
be
doing
travelling
with
a
parson
then
there
was
the
wild
speed
at
which
they
had
come
the
matter
absorbed
and
vexed
him
i
fear
he
was
inquisitive
by
nature
there
came
a
moment
when
he
went
so
far
as
to
consider
making
his
way
below
to
pursue
his
investigations
in
situ
it
would
have
been
at
great
cost
to
his
dignity
and
this
he
was
destined
to
be
spared
a
knock
fell
upon
his
door
and
the
landlady
came
in
she
was
genial
buxom
and
as
becomes
a
landlady
there
is
a
gentleman
below
she
was
beginning
when
caryll
interrupted
her
i
would
rather
that
you
told
me
of
the
lady
said
la
sir
she
cried
displaying
ivory
teeth
her
eyes
cast
upwards
hands
upraised
in
gentle
mirthful
protest
la
sir
but
i
come
from
the
lady
he
looked
at
her
a
good
ambassador
said
he
should
begin
with
the
best
news
not
add
it
as
an
afterthought
but
proceed
i
beg
you
give
me
hope
they
send
their
compliments
and
would
be
prodigiously
obliged
if
you
was
to
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
stepping
of
stepping
below
he
inquired
head
on
one
side
solemn
eyes
upon
the
hostess
would
it
be
impertinent
to
inquire
what
they
may
want
with
me
i
think
they
want
you
for
a
witness
for
a
witness
am
i
to
testify
to
the
lady
perfection
of
face
and
shape
to
the
heaven
that
sits
in
her
eyes
to
the
miracle
she
calls
her
ankle
are
these
and
other
things
besides
of
the
same
kind
what
i
am
required
to
witness
if
so
they
could
not
have
sent
for
one
more
qualified
i
am
an
expert
oh
sir
nay
she
laughed
is
a
marriage
they
need
you
caryll
opened
his
queer
eyes
a
little
wider
soho
said
he
the
parson
is
then
he
fell
thoughtful
his
tone
lost
its
note
of
flippancy
this
gentleman
who
sends
his
compliments
does
he
send
his
name
he
does
not
sir
but
i
overheard
confide
in
me
caryll
invited
her
he
is
a
great
gentleman
she
prepared
him
no
matter
i
love
great
they
call
him
lord
at
that
sudden
and
utterly
unexpected
mention
of
his
name
his
unknown
caryll
came
to
his
feet
with
an
alacrity
which
a
more
shrewd
observer
would
have
set
down
to
some
cause
other
than
mere
respect
for
a
viscount
the
hostess
was
shrewd
but
not
shrewd
enough
and
if
caryll
expression
changed
for
an
instant
it
resumed
its
habitual
calm
so
swiftly
that
it
would
have
needed
eyes
of
an
exceptional
quickness
to
have
read
it
enough
he
said
who
could
deny
his
lordship
shall
i
tell
them
you
are
coming
she
inquired
her
hand
already
upon
the
door
a
moment
he
begged
detaining
her
is
a
runaway
marriage
this
eh
her
smile
beamed
on
him
again
she
was
a
very
woman
with
a
taste
for
the
romantic
loving
love
what
else
sir
she
laughed
and
why
mistress
he
inquired
eying
her
his
fingers
plucking
at
his
nether
lip
do
they
desire
my
testimony
his
lordship
own
man
will
stand
witness
for
one
but
they
need
another
she
explained
her
voice
reflecting
astonishment
at
his
question
true
but
why
do
they
need
me
he
pressed
her
heard
you
no
reason
given
why
they
should
prefer
me
to
your
chamberlain
your
ostler
or
your
drawer
she
knit
her
brows
and
shrugged
impatient
shoulders
here
was
a
deal
of
pother
about
a
trifling
affair
his
lordship
saw
you
as
he
entered
sir
and
inquired
of
me
who
you
might
his
lordship
flatters
me
by
this
interest
my
looks
pleased
him
let
us
hope
and
you
answered
him
what
that
your
honor
is
a
gentleman
newly
crossed
from
you
are
mistress
said
caryll
a
thought
tartly
for
if
his
speech
was
tainted
with
a
french
accent
it
was
in
so
slight
a
degree
as
surely
to
be
imperceptible
to
the
vulgar
your
clothes
sir
the
landlady
explained
and
he
bethought
him
then
that
the
greater
elegance
and
refinement
of
his
french
apparel
must
indeed
proclaim
his
origin
to
one
who
had
so
many
occasions
of
seeing
travelers
from
gaul
that
might
even
account
for
green
attempts
to
talk
to
him
of
france
his
mind
returned
to
the
matter
of
the
bridal
pair
below
you
told
him
that
eh
said
he
and
what
said
his
lordship
then
he
turned
to
the
parson
very
man
for
us
jenkins
says
and
the
parson
this
jenkins
what
answer
did
he
make
thought
he
says
hum
and
you
yourself
mistress
what
inference
did
you
draw
inference
sir
aye
inference
did
you
not
gather
that
this
was
not
only
a
runaway
match
but
a
clandestine
one
my
lord
can
depend
upon
the
discretion
of
his
servant
no
doubt
for
other
witness
he
would
prefer
some
some
stranger
who
will
go
his
ways
and
not
be
like
to
be
heard
of
lard
sir
cried
the
landlady
her
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
caryll
smiled
enigmatically
is
so
i
assure
ye
my
lord
rotherby
is
of
a
family
singularly
cautious
in
the
unions
it
contracts
in
entering
matrimony
he
prefers
no
doubt
to
leave
a
back
door
open
for
quiet
retreat
should
he
repent
him
your
honor
has
his
lordship
acquaintance
then
quoth
the
landlady
it
is
a
misfortune
from
which
heaven
has
hitherto
preserved
me
but
which
the
devil
it
seems
now
thrusts
upon
me
it
will
nevertheless
interest
me
to
see
him
at
close
quarters
come
as
they
were
going
out
caryll
checked
suddenly
why
said
he
she
stared
so
abruptly
came
the
question
past
four
sir
she
answered
he
uttered
a
short
laugh
decidedly
said
he
his
lordship
must
be
viewed
at
closer
and
he
led
the
way
downstairs
in
the
passage
he
waited
for
her
to
come
up
with
him
you
had
best
announce
me
by
name
he
suggested
it
is
she
nodded
and
going
forward
threw
open
a
door
inviting
him
to
enter
mr
caryll
she
announced
obedient
to
his
injunction
and
as
he
went
in
she
closed
the
door
behind
him
from
the
group
of
three
that
had
been
sitting
about
the
polished
walnut
table
the
tall
gentleman
in
buff
and
silver
rose
swiftly
and
advanced
to
the
newcomer
what
time
caryll
made
a
rapid
observation
of
this
brother
whom
he
was
meeting
under
circumstances
so
odd
and
by
a
chance
so
peculiar
he
beheld
a
man
of
or
perhaps
a
little
more
tall
and
well
made
if
already
inclining
to
heaviness
with
a
swarthy
face
an
obstinate
chin
and
a
deplorable
brow
at
sight
by
instinct
he
disliked
his
brother
he
wondered
vaguely
was
lord
rotherby
in
appearance
at
all
like
their
common
father
but
beyond
that
he
gave
little
thought
to
the
tie
that
bound
them
indeed
he
has
placed
it
upon
record
that
saving
in
such
moments
of
high
stress
as
followed
in
their
later
connection
he
never
could
remember
that
they
were
the
sons
of
the
same
parent
i
thought
was
rotherby
greeting
a
note
almost
of
irritation
in
his
voice
that
the
woman
said
you
were
from
it
was
an
odd
welcome
but
its
oddness
at
the
moment
went
unheeded
his
swift
scrutiny
of
his
brother
over
caryll
glance
passed
on
to
become
riveted
upon
the
face
of
the
lady
at
the
table
head
in
addition
to
the
beauties
which
from
above
he
had
descried
he
now
perceived
that
her
mouth
was
sensitive
and
kindly
her
whole
expression
one
of
gentle
wistfulness
exceeding
sweet
to
contemplate
what
did
she
in
this
galley
he
wondered
and
he
has
confessed
that
just
as
at
sight
he
had
disliked
his
brother
so
from
that
hour
from
the
very
instant
of
his
eyes
alighting
on
her
there
he
loved
the
lady
whom
his
brother
was
to
wed
felt
a
surpassing
need
of
her
conceived
that
in
the
meeting
of
their
eyes
their
very
souls
had
met
so
that
it
was
to
him
as
if
he
had
known
her
since
he
had
known
anything
meanwhile
there
was
his
lordship
question
to
be
answered
he
answered
it
mechanically
his
eyes
upon
the
lady
and
she
returning
the
gaze
of
those
queer
greenish
eyes
with
a
sweetness
that
gave
place
to
no
confusion
i
am
from
france
but
not
french
his
lordship
continued
caryll
fetched
his
eyes
from
the
lady
to
meet
lord
rotherby
more
than
half
french
he
replied
the
french
taint
in
his
accent
growing
slightly
more
pronounced
it
was
but
an
accident
that
my
father
was
an
rotherby
laughed
softly
a
thought
contemptuously
foreigners
were
things
which
in
his
untraveled
unlettered
ignorance
he
despised
the
difference
between
a
frenchman
and
a
south
sea
islander
was
a
thing
never
quite
appreciated
by
his
lordship
some
subtle
difference
he
had
no
doubt
existed
but
for
him
it
was
enough
to
know
that
both
were
foreigners
therefore
it
logically
followed
both
were
kin
your
words
sir
might
be
oddly
interpreted
honor
they
might
said
he
and
laughed
softly
again
with
singular
insolence
if
they
have
amused
your
lordship
i
am
happy
said
caryll
in
such
a
tone
that
rotherby
looked
to
see
whether
he
was
being
roasted
you
wanted
me
i
think
i
beg
that
you
not
thank
me
for
having
descended
it
was
an
it
occurred
to
rotherby
that
this
was
a
veiled
reproof
for
the
ill
manners
of
the
omission
again
he
looked
sharply
at
this
man
who
was
scanning
him
with
such
interest
but
he
detected
in
the
calm
face
nothing
to
suggest
that
any
mockery
was
intended
belatedly
he
fell
to
doing
the
very
thing
that
caryll
had
begged
him
to
leave
undone
he
fell
to
thanking
him
as
for
caryll
himself
not
even
the
queer
position
into
which
he
had
been
thrust
could
repress
his
characteristics
what
time
his
lordship
thanked
him
he
looked
about
him
at
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
and
found
that
besides
the
parson
sitting
pale
and
at
the
table
there
was
present
in
the
background
his
lordship
man
a
quiet
fellow
quietly
garbed
in
gray
with
a
shrewd
face
and
shrewd
shifty
eyes
caryll
saw
and
registered
for
future
use
the
reflection
that
eyes
that
are
overshrewd
are
seldom
wont
to
look
out
of
honest
heads
you
are
desired
his
lordship
informed
him
to
be
witness
to
a
so
much
the
landlady
had
made
known
to
it
is
not
i
trust
a
task
that
will
occasion
you
any
none
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
absence
of
the
marriage
might
do
the
smooth
easy
tone
so
masked
the
inner
meaning
of
the
answer
that
his
lordship
scarce
attended
to
the
words
then
we
had
best
get
on
we
are
in
is
the
characteristic
rashness
of
folk
about
to
enter
wedlock
said
caryll
as
he
approached
the
table
with
his
lordship
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
turning
full
upon
the
bride
my
lord
laughed
musically
enough
but
overloud
for
a
man
of
brains
or
breeding
marry
in
haste
eh
quoth
he
you
are
penetration
itself
caryll
praised
him
take
a
shrewd
rogue
to
better
me
his
lordship
agreed
yet
an
honest
man
might
worst
you
one
never
knows
but
the
patience
is
being
it
was
as
well
he
added
that
for
his
lordship
had
turned
with
intent
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
aye
come
jenkins
get
on
with
your
patter
gaskell
he
called
to
his
man
stand
forward
then
he
took
his
place
beside
the
lady
who
had
risen
and
stood
pale
with
eyes
cast
down
and
as
caryll
alone
saw
the
faintest
quiver
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
this
served
to
increase
caryll
already
considerable
cogitations
the
parson
faced
them
fumbling
at
his
book
caryll
eyes
watching
him
with
that
cold
level
glance
of
theirs
the
parson
looked
up
met
that
uncanny
gaze
displayed
his
teeth
in
a
grin
of
terror
fell
to
trembling
and
dropped
the
book
in
his
confusion
caryll
smiling
sardonically
stooped
to
restore
it
him
there
followed
a
fresh
pause
jenkins
having
lost
his
place
seemed
at
some
pains
to
find
it
again
amazing
indeed
in
one
whose
profession
should
have
rendered
him
so
familiar
with
its
pages
caryll
continued
to
watch
him
in
silence
and
as
an
observer
might
have
thought
as
indeed
gaskell
did
think
though
he
said
nothing
at
the
time
with
wicked
relish
chapter
iii
the
witness
at
last
the
page
was
found
again
by
jenkins
having
found
it
he
hesitated
still
a
moment
then
cleared
his
throat
and
in
the
manner
of
one
hurling
himself
forward
upon
a
desperate
venture
he
began
to
read
dearly
beloved
we
are
gathered
here
in
the
sight
of
god
he
read
and
on
in
a
nasal
whining
voice
which
not
only
was
the
very
voice
you
would
have
expected
from
such
a
man
but
in
accordance
too
with
sound
clerical
convention
the
bridal
pair
stood
before
him
the
groom
with
a
slight
flush
on
his
cheeks
and
a
bright
glitter
in
his
black
eyes
which
were
not
nice
to
see
the
bride
with
bowed
head
and
bosom
heaving
as
in
response
to
inward
tumult
the
cleric
came
to
the
end
of
his
exordium
paused
a
moment
and
whether
because
he
gathered
confidence
whether
because
he
realized
the
impressive
character
of
the
fresh
matter
upon
which
he
entered
he
proceeded
now
in
a
firmer
more
sonorous
voice
i
require
and
charge
you
both
as
ye
will
answer
on
the
dreadful
day
of
ye
forgot
something
caryll
interrupted
blandly
his
lordship
swung
round
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
an
impatient
snort
the
lady
too
looked
up
suddenly
whilst
jenkins
seemed
to
fall
into
an
utter
panic
wha
what
he
stammered
what
have
i
forgot
to
read
the
directions
i
his
lordship
scowled
darkly
upon
caryll
who
heeded
him
not
at
all
but
watched
the
lady
sideways
jenkins
turned
first
scarlet
then
paler
than
he
had
been
before
and
bent
his
eyes
to
the
book
to
read
in
a
slightly
puzzled
voice
the
italicized
words
above
the
period
he
had
embarked
upon
and
also
speaking
unto
the
persons
that
shall
be
married
he
shall
say
he
read
and
looked
up
inquiry
his
prominent
eyes
endeavoring
to
sustain
caryll
steady
glance
but
failing
miserably
is
farther
back
caryll
informed
him
in
answer
to
that
mute
question
and
as
the
fellow
moistened
his
thumb
to
turn
back
the
pages
caryll
saved
him
the
trouble
it
says
i
think
that
the
man
should
be
on
your
right
hand
and
the
woman
on
your
left
ye
seem
to
have
reversed
matters
jenkins
but
perhaps
ye
stab
me
was
jenkins
most
uncanonical
comment
i
vow
i
am
your
lordship
is
so
impatient
with
me
this
gentleman
is
right
but
that
i
was
so
flustered
will
you
not
change
places
with
his
lordship
they
changed
places
after
the
viscount
had
thanked
caryll
shortly
and
cursed
the
parson
with
circumstance
and
fervor
it
was
well
done
on
his
lordship
part
but
the
lady
did
not
seem
convinced
by
it
her
face
looked
whiter
and
her
eyes
had
an
alarmed
expression
we
must
begin
again
said
jenkins
and
he
began
again
caryll
listened
and
watched
and
he
began
to
enjoy
himself
exceedingly
he
had
not
reckoned
upon
so
rich
an
entertainment
when
he
had
consented
to
come
down
to
witness
this
odd
ceremony
his
sense
of
humor
conquered
every
other
consideration
and
the
circumstance
that
lord
rotherby
was
his
brother
if
remembered
at
all
served
but
to
add
a
spice
to
the
situation
out
of
sheer
deviltry
he
waited
until
jenkins
had
labored
for
a
second
time
through
the
opening
periods
again
he
allowed
him
to
get
as
far
as
i
charge
and
require
you
before
again
he
interrupted
him
there
is
something
else
ye
forgot
said
he
in
that
sweet
quiet
voice
of
his
this
was
too
much
for
rotherby
damn
you
he
swore
turning
a
livid
face
upon
caryll
and
failed
to
observe
that
at
the
sound
of
that
harsh
oath
and
at
the
sight
of
his
furious
face
the
lady
recoiled
from
him
the
suspicion
lately
in
her
face
turning
first
to
conviction
and
then
to
absolute
horror
i
do
not
think
you
are
civil
said
caryll
critically
it
was
in
your
interests
that
i
then
i
thank
you
in
my
interests
to
hold
your
tongue
his
lordship
stormed
in
that
case
said
caryll
i
must
still
speak
in
the
interests
of
the
lady
since
you
desired
me
to
be
a
witness
i
do
my
duty
by
you
both
and
see
you
properly
now
what
the
devil
may
you
mean
by
that
demanded
his
lordship
betraying
himself
more
and
more
at
every
word
jenkins
in
a
spasm
of
terror
sought
to
pour
oil
upon
these
waters
my
lord
he
bleated
teeth
and
eyeballs
protruding
from
his
pallid
face
my
lord
perhaps
the
gentleman
is
right
perhaps
perhaps
he
gulped
and
turned
to
caryll
what
ye
think
we
have
forgot
now
he
asked
the
time
of
day
caryll
replied
and
watched
the
puzzled
look
that
came
into
both
their
faces
do
ye
deal
in
riddles
with
us
quoth
his
lordship
what
have
we
to
do
with
the
time
of
day
best
ask
the
parson
suggested
caryll
rotherby
swung
round
again
to
jenkins
jenkins
spread
his
hands
in
mute
bewilderment
and
distress
caryll
laughed
silently
i
not
be
married
i
not
be
married
it
was
the
lady
who
spoke
and
those
odd
words
were
the
first
that
caryll
heard
from
her
lips
they
made
an
excellent
impression
upon
him
bearing
witness
to
her
good
sense
and
judgment
although
belatedly
aroused
and
informing
him
although
the
pitch
was
strained
just
now
that
the
rich
contralto
of
her
voice
was
full
of
music
he
was
a
judge
of
voices
as
of
much
else
besides
quoth
his
lordship
between
petulance
and
simulated
amusement
what
all
the
pother
hortensia
dear
i
not
be
married
she
repeated
firmly
her
wide
brown
eyes
meeting
his
in
absolute
defiance
head
thrown
back
face
pale
but
fearless
i
do
believe
ventured
caryll
that
you
could
be
if
you
desired
it
leastways
not
here
and
now
and
by
and
he
jerked
a
contemptuous
thumb
sideways
at
jenkins
toward
whom
he
had
turned
his
shoulder
perhaps
you
have
realized
it
for
a
shudder
ran
through
her
color
flooded
into
her
face
and
out
again
leaving
it
paler
than
before
yet
she
maintained
a
brave
front
that
moved
caryll
profoundly
to
an
even
greater
admiration
of
her
rotherby
his
great
jaw
set
his
hands
clenched
and
eyes
blazing
stood
irresolute
between
her
and
caryll
jenkins
in
sheer
terror
now
sank
limply
to
a
chair
whilst
gaskell
looked
on
a
perfect
servant
as
immovable
outwardly
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
had
been
a
piece
of
furniture
then
his
lordship
turned
again
to
caryll
you
take
a
deal
upon
yourself
sir
said
he
menacingly
a
deal
of
what
wondered
caryll
blandly
the
question
nonplussed
rotherby
he
swore
ferociously
by
god
he
fumed
i
have
you
make
good
your
insinuations
you
shall
disabuse
this
lady
mind
you
shall
damn
you
or
i
compel
you
caryll
smiled
very
engagingly
the
matter
was
speeding
excellently
a
comedy
the
like
of
which
he
did
not
remember
to
have
played
a
part
in
since
his
student
days
at
oxford
ten
years
and
more
ago
i
had
thought
said
he
that
the
woman
who
summoned
me
to
be
a
witness
of
this
this
ah
wedding
there
was
a
whole
volume
of
criticism
in
his
utterance
of
the
word
was
the
landlady
of
the
and
eve
i
begin
to
think
that
she
was
this
lady
good
angel
fate
clothed
for
once
matronly
and
then
he
dropped
the
easy
bantering
manner
with
a
suddenness
that
was
startling
gallic
fire
blazed
up
through
british
training
let
us
speak
plainly
my
lord
rotherby
this
marriage
is
no
marriage
it
is
a
mockery
and
a
villainy
and
that
scoundrel
worthy
servant
of
his
master
is
no
parson
no
not
so
much
as
a
is
he
madame
he
proceeded
turning
now
to
the
frightened
lady
you
have
been
grossly
abused
by
these
sir
blazed
rotherby
at
last
breaking
in
upon
his
denunciation
hand
clapped
to
sword
do
ye
dare
use
such
words
to
me
jenkins
got
to
his
feet
in
a
slow
foolish
fashion
he
put
out
a
hand
to
stay
his
lordship
the
lady
in
the
background
looked
on
with
wide
eyes
very
breathless
one
hand
to
her
bosom
as
if
to
control
its
heave
caryll
proceeded
undismayed
to
make
good
his
accusation
he
had
dropped
back
into
his
slightly
listless
air
of
thinly
veiled
persiflage
and
he
appeared
to
address
the
lady
to
explain
the
situation
to
her
rather
than
to
justify
the
charge
he
had
made
a
blind
man
could
have
perceived
from
the
rustling
of
his
prayer
book
when
he
fumbled
at
it
that
the
contents
were
strange
to
him
and
observe
the
volume
he
continued
picking
it
up
and
flaunting
it
aloft
not
a
thumbmark
anywhere
purchased
expressly
for
this
foul
venture
is
there
aught
else
so
clean
and
fresh
about
the
scurvy
thief
you
shall
moderate
your
tones
sir
began
his
lordship
in
a
snarl
he
sets
you
each
on
the
wrong
side
of
him
continued
caryll
all
imperturbable
lacking
even
the
sense
to
read
the
directions
which
the
book
contains
and
he
has
no
thought
for
the
circumstance
that
the
time
of
day
is
uncanonical
is
more
needed
madame
so
much
was
not
needed
said
she
though
i
am
your
debtor
her
voice
was
marvelously
steady
with
scorn
a
royal
anger
increasing
the
glory
of
her
eyes
rotherby
hand
fell
away
from
his
sword
he
realized
that
bluster
was
not
the
most
convenient
weapon
here
he
addressed
caryll
very
haughtily
you
are
from
france
sir
and
something
may
be
excused
you
but
not
quite
all
you
have
used
expressions
that
are
not
to
be
offered
to
a
person
of
my
quality
i
fear
you
scarcely
apprehend
as
well
no
doubt
as
those
who
avoid
you
sir
answered
caryll
with
cool
contempt
his
dislike
of
the
man
and
of
the
business
in
which
he
had
found
him
engaged
mounting
above
every
other
consideration
his
lordship
frowned
inquiry
and
who
may
those
be
most
decent
folk
i
should
conceive
if
this
be
an
example
of
your
by
god
sir
you
are
a
thought
too
pert
we
mend
that
presently
i
will
first
convince
you
of
your
error
and
you
it
will
be
interesting
said
caryll
and
meant
it
rotherby
turned
from
him
keeping
a
tight
rein
upon
his
anger
and
so
much
restraint
in
so
tempestuous
a
man
was
little
short
of
wonderful
hortensia
he
said
this
is
fool
talk
what
object
could
i
seek
to
serve
she
drew
back
another
step
contempt
and
loathing
in
her
face
this
man
he
continued
flinging
a
hand
toward
jenkins
and
checked
upon
the
word
he
swung
round
upon
the
fellow
have
you
fooled
me
knave
he
bawled
is
it
true
what
this
man
says
of
you
that
ye
no
parson
at
all
jenkins
quailed
and
shriveled
here
was
a
move
for
which
he
was
all
unprepared
and
knew
not
how
to
play
to
it
on
the
bridegroom
part
it
was
excellently
acted
yet
it
came
too
late
to
be
convincing
you
have
the
license
in
your
pocket
no
doubt
my
lord
put
in
caryll
it
will
help
to
convince
the
lady
of
the
honesty
of
your
intentions
it
will
show
her
that
ye
were
abused
by
this
thief
for
the
sake
of
the
guinea
ye
were
to
pay
that
was
checkmate
and
lord
rotherby
realized
it
there
remained
him
nothing
but
violence
and
in
violence
he
was
exceedingly
at
home
being
a
member
of
the
hell
fire
club
and
having
served
in
the
bold
bucks
under
his
grace
of
wharton
you
damned
infernal
marplot
you
blasted
meddler
he
swore
and
some
other
things
besides
froth
on
his
lips
the
veins
of
his
brow
congested
what
affair
was
this
of
yours
i
thought
you
desired
me
for
a
witness
caryll
reminded
him
i
did
let
me
perish
said
rotherby
and
i
wish
to
the
devil
i
had
bit
my
tongue
out
the
loss
to
eloquence
had
been
irreparable
sighed
caryll
his
eyes
upon
a
beam
of
the
ceiling
rotherby
stared
and
choked
is
there
no
sense
in
you
you
gibbering
parrot
he
inquired
what
are
you
an
actor
or
a
fool
a
gentleman
i
hope
said
caryll
urbanely
what
are
you
i
learn
you
said
his
lordship
and
plucked
at
his
sword
i
see
said
caryll
in
the
same
quiet
voice
that
thinly
veiled
his
inward
laughter
a
bully
with
more
oaths
my
lord
heaved
himself
forward
caryll
was
without
weapons
he
had
left
his
sword
not
deeming
that
he
would
be
needing
it
at
a
wedding
he
never
moved
hand
or
foot
as
rotherby
bore
down
upon
him
but
his
greenish
eyes
grew
keen
and
very
watchful
he
began
to
wonder
had
he
indulged
his
amusement
overlong
and
imperceptibly
he
adjusted
his
balance
for
a
spring
rotherby
stretched
out
to
lunge
murder
in
his
inflamed
eyes
silence
you
you
there
was
a
swift
rustle
behind
him
his
hand
drawn
back
to
thrust
was
suddenly
caught
and
ere
he
realized
it
the
sword
was
wrenched
from
fingers
that
held
it
lightly
unprepared
for
this
you
dog
said
the
lady
voice
strident
now
with
anger
and
disdain
she
had
his
sword
he
faced
about
with
a
horrible
oath
caryll
conceived
that
he
was
becoming
a
thought
disgusting
hoofs
and
wheels
ground
on
the
cobbles
of
the
yard
and
came
to
a
halt
outside
but
went
unheeded
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
rotherby
stood
facing
her
she
facing
him
the
sword
in
her
hand
and
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
promised
she
would
use
it
upon
him
did
he
urge
her
a
moment
thus
of
utter
breathless
silence
then
as
if
her
passion
mounted
and
swept
all
aside
she
raised
the
sword
and
using
it
as
a
whip
she
lashed
him
with
it
until
at
the
third
blow
it
rebounded
to
the
table
and
was
snapped
instinctively
his
lordship
had
put
up
his
hands
to
save
his
face
and
across
one
of
them
a
red
line
grew
and
grew
and
oozed
forth
blood
which
spread
to
envelop
it
gaskell
advanced
with
a
sharp
cry
of
concern
but
rotherby
waved
him
back
and
the
gesture
shook
blood
from
his
hand
like
raindrops
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
were
upon
the
woman
he
had
gone
so
near
betraying
with
a
look
that
none
might
read
jenkins
swayed
sickly
against
the
table
whilst
caryll
observed
all
with
a
critical
eye
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
have
loved
this
villain
the
hilt
and
stump
of
sword
clattered
in
the
fireplace
whither
she
hurled
it
a
moment
she
caught
her
face
in
her
hands
and
a
sob
shook
her
almost
fiercely
then
she
came
past
his
lordship
across
the
room
to
caryll
rotherby
making
no
shift
to
detain
her
take
me
away
sir
take
me
away
she
begged
him
caryll
gloomy
face
lightened
suddenly
your
servant
said
he
and
made
her
a
bow
i
think
you
are
very
well
advised
he
added
cheerfully
and
offered
her
his
arm
she
took
it
and
moved
a
step
or
two
toward
the
door
it
opened
at
that
moment
and
a
burly
elderly
man
came
in
heavily
the
lady
halted
a
cry
escaped
her
a
cry
of
pain
almost
and
she
fell
to
weeping
there
and
then
caryll
was
very
mystified
the
newcomer
paused
at
the
sight
that
met
him
considered
it
with
a
dull
blue
eye
and
for
all
that
he
looked
stupid
it
seemed
he
had
wit
enough
to
take
in
the
situation
so
said
he
with
heavy
mockery
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
trouble
of
coming
after
you
for
it
seems
that
she
has
found
you
out
in
time
you
villain
rotherby
turned
sharply
at
that
voice
he
fell
back
a
step
his
brow
seeming
to
grow
blacker
than
it
had
been
father
he
exclaimed
but
there
was
little
that
was
filial
in
the
accent
caryll
staggered
and
recovered
himself
it
had
been
indeed
a
staggering
shock
for
here
of
course
was
his
own
father
too
chapter
iv
green
there
was
a
quick
patter
of
feet
the
rustle
of
a
hooped
petticoat
and
the
lady
was
in
the
arms
of
my
lord
ostermore
forgive
me
my
lord
she
was
crying
oh
forgive
me
i
was
a
little
fool
and
i
have
been
punished
enough
already
to
caryll
this
was
a
surprising
development
the
earl
whose
arms
seemed
to
have
opened
readily
enough
to
receive
her
was
patting
her
soothingly
upon
the
shoulder
pish
what
this
what
this
he
grumbled
yet
his
voice
caryll
noticed
was
if
anything
kindly
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
was
a
dull
gruff
voice
seldom
indicating
any
shade
of
emotion
unless
as
sometimes
happened
it
was
raised
in
anger
he
was
frowning
now
upon
his
son
over
the
girl
head
his
bushy
grizzled
brows
contracted
caryll
observed
and
with
what
interest
you
should
well
imagine
that
lord
ostermore
was
still
in
a
general
way
a
handsome
man
of
a
good
height
but
slightly
excessive
bulk
he
had
a
face
that
still
retained
a
fair
shape
florid
and
plethoric
he
had
the
air
of
the
man
who
seldom
makes
a
long
illness
at
the
end
his
eyes
were
very
blue
and
the
lids
were
puffed
and
heavy
whilst
the
mouth
caryll
remarked
in
a
critical
detached
spirit
was
stupid
rather
than
sensuous
he
made
his
survey
swiftly
and
the
result
left
him
wondering
meanwhile
the
earl
was
addressing
his
son
whose
hand
was
being
bandaged
by
gaskell
there
was
little
variety
in
his
invective
you
villain
he
bawled
at
him
you
damned
villain
then
he
patted
the
girl
head
you
found
the
scoundrel
out
before
you
married
him
said
he
i
am
glad
o
glad
o
is
such
a
reversing
of
the
usual
order
of
things
that
it
calls
for
wonder
said
caryll
eh
quoth
his
lordship
who
the
devil
are
you
one
of
his
friends
your
lordship
overwhelms
me
said
caryll
gravely
making
a
bow
he
observed
the
bewilderment
in
ostermore
eyes
and
began
to
realize
at
that
early
stage
of
their
acquaintance
that
to
speak
ironically
to
the
earl
of
ostermore
was
not
to
speak
at
all
it
was
hortensia
a
very
tearful
hortensia
now
who
explained
this
gentleman
saved
me
my
lord
she
said
saved
you
quoth
he
dully
how
did
he
come
to
save
you
he
discovered
the
parson
she
explained
the
earl
looked
more
and
more
bewildered
just
so
said
caryll
it
was
my
privilege
to
discover
that
the
parson
is
no
the
parson
is
no
parson
echoed
his
lordship
scowling
more
and
more
then
what
the
devil
is
the
parson
hortensia
freed
herself
from
his
protecting
arms
he
is
a
villain
she
said
who
was
hired
by
my
lord
rotherby
to
come
here
and
pretend
to
be
a
her
eyes
flamed
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
god
help
me
for
a
fool
my
lord
to
have
put
my
faith
in
that
man
oh
she
choked
the
shame
the
burning
shame
of
it
i
would
i
had
a
brother
to
punish
him
lord
ostermore
was
crimson
too
with
indignation
caryll
was
relieved
to
see
that
he
was
capable
of
so
much
emotion
did
i
not
warn
you
against
him
hortensia
said
he
could
you
not
have
trusted
that
i
knew
him
i
his
father
to
my
everlasting
shame
then
he
swung
upon
rotherby
you
dog
he
began
and
there
being
a
man
of
little
invention
words
failed
him
and
wrath
alone
remained
very
intense
but
entirely
inarticulate
rotherby
moved
forward
till
he
reached
the
table
then
stood
leaning
upon
it
scowling
at
the
company
from
under
his
black
brows
is
your
lordship
alone
is
to
blame
for
this
he
informed
his
father
with
a
vain
pretence
at
composure
i
am
to
blame
gurgled
his
lordship
veins
swelling
at
his
brow
i
am
to
blame
that
you
should
have
carried
her
off
thus
and
by
god
had
you
meant
to
marry
her
honestly
and
fittingly
i
might
find
it
in
my
heart
to
forgive
you
but
to
practice
such
villainy
to
attempt
to
put
this
foul
trick
upon
the
child
caryll
thought
for
an
instant
of
another
child
whose
child
he
was
and
a
passion
of
angry
mockery
at
the
forgetfulness
of
age
welled
up
from
the
bitter
soul
of
him
outwardly
he
remained
a
very
mirror
for
placidity
your
lordship
had
threatened
to
disinherit
me
if
i
married
her
said
rotherby
was
to
save
her
from
you
ostermore
explained
entirely
unnecessarily
and
you
thought
to
to
by
god
sir
i
marvel
you
have
the
courage
to
confront
me
i
marvel
take
me
away
my
lord
hortensia
begged
him
touching
his
arm
aye
we
were
best
away
said
the
earl
drawing
her
to
him
then
he
flung
a
hand
out
at
rotherby
in
a
gesture
of
repudiation
of
anathema
but
is
not
the
end
o
for
you
you
knave
what
i
threatened
i
will
perform
i
disinherit
you
not
a
penny
of
mine
shall
come
to
you
ye
shall
starve
for
aught
i
care
starve
and
and
the
world
be
well
rid
of
a
villain
i
i
disown
you
ye
no
son
of
mine
i
take
oath
ye
no
son
of
mine
caryll
thought
that
on
the
contrary
rotherby
was
very
much
his
father
son
and
he
added
to
his
observations
upon
human
nature
the
reflection
that
sinners
are
oddly
blessed
with
short
memories
he
was
entirely
dispassionate
again
by
now
as
for
rotherby
he
received
his
father
anger
with
a
scornful
smile
and
a
curling
lip
you
disinherit
me
quoth
he
in
mockery
and
of
what
pray
if
report
speaks
true
you
be
needing
to
inherit
something
yourself
to
bear
you
through
your
present
he
shrugged
and
produced
his
with
an
offensive
simulation
of
nonchalance
ye
can
not
cut
the
entail
he
reminded
his
almost
apoplectic
sire
and
took
snuff
delicately
sauntering
windowwards
cut
the
entail
the
entail
cried
the
earl
and
laughed
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
bode
no
good
have
you
ever
troubled
to
ascertain
what
it
amounts
to
you
fool
it
would
keep
you
in
in
in
snuff
lord
rotherby
halted
in
his
stride
and
looked
at
his
father
over
his
shoulder
the
sneering
mask
was
wiped
from
his
face
which
became
blank
my
lord
he
began
the
earl
waved
a
silencing
hand
and
turned
with
dignity
to
hortensia
come
child
said
he
then
he
remembered
something
gad
he
exclaimed
i
had
forgot
the
parson
i
have
him
gaoled
i
have
him
hanged
if
the
law
will
help
me
come
forth
man
ignoring
the
invitation
jenkins
scuttled
ratlike
across
the
room
mounted
the
and
was
gone
in
a
flash
through
the
open
window
he
dropped
plump
upon
green
who
was
crouching
underneath
the
pair
rolled
over
together
in
the
mould
of
a
flowerbed
then
green
clutched
jenkins
and
jenkins
squealed
like
a
trapped
rabbit
green
thrust
his
fist
carefully
into
the
mockparson
mouth
sh
you
blubbering
fool
he
snapped
in
his
ear
my
business
is
not
with
you
lie
still
within
the
room
all
stood
at
gaze
following
the
sudden
flight
of
jenkins
then
lord
ostermore
made
as
if
to
approach
the
winnow
but
hortensia
restrained
him
let
the
wretch
go
she
said
the
blame
is
not
his
what
is
he
but
my
lord
tool
and
her
eyes
scorched
rotherby
with
such
a
glance
of
scorn
as
must
have
killed
any
but
a
shameless
man
then
turning
to
the
demurely
observant
gentleman
who
had
done
her
such
good
service
mr
caryll
she
said
i
want
to
thank
you
i
want
my
lord
here
to
thank
caryll
bowed
to
her
i
beg
that
you
will
not
think
of
it
said
he
it
is
i
who
will
remain
in
your
is
your
name
caryll
sir
quoth
the
earl
he
had
a
trick
of
fastening
upon
the
inconsequent
though
that
was
scarcely
the
case
now
that
my
lord
is
my
name
i
believe
i
have
the
honor
of
sharing
it
with
your
ye
belong
to
some
younger
branch
of
the
family
the
earl
supposed
like
enough
some
outlying
branch
answered
the
imperturbable
caryll
a
jest
which
only
himself
could
appreciate
and
that
bitterly
and
how
came
you
into
this
rotherby
sneered
audibly
in
no
doubt
as
he
came
to
reflect
that
it
was
he
himself
had
had
him
fetched
they
needed
another
witness
said
caryll
and
hearing
there
was
at
the
inn
a
gentleman
newly
crossed
from
france
his
lordship
no
doubt
opined
that
a
traveller
here
and
gone
for
good
tomorrow
would
be
just
the
witness
that
he
needed
for
the
business
he
proposed
that
circumstance
aroused
my
suspicions
and
but
the
earl
as
usual
seemed
to
have
fastened
upon
the
minor
point
although
again
it
was
not
so
you
are
newly
crossed
from
france
said
he
ay
and
your
name
is
the
same
as
mine
was
what
i
was
caryll
flashed
a
sidelong
glance
at
rotherby
who
had
turned
to
stare
at
his
father
and
in
his
heart
he
cursed
the
stupidity
of
my
lord
ostermore
if
this
proposed
to
be
a
member
of
a
conspiracy
heaven
help
that
same
conspiracy
were
you
by
any
chance
going
to
seek
me
in
town
caryll
caryll
suppressed
a
desire
to
laugh
here
was
a
way
to
deal
with
state
secrets
i
my
lord
he
inquired
with
an
assumed
air
of
surprise
the
earl
looked
at
him
and
from
him
to
rotherby
bethought
himself
and
started
so
overtly
that
rotherby
eyes
grew
narrow
the
lines
of
his
mouth
tightened
nay
of
course
not
of
course
not
he
blustered
clumsily
but
rotherby
laughed
aloud
now
what
a
plague
is
all
this
mystery
he
inquired
mystery
quoth
my
lord
what
mystery
should
there
be
is
what
i
would
fain
be
informed
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
showed
he
meant
to
gain
the
information
he
sauntered
forward
towards
caryll
his
eye
playing
mockingly
over
this
gentleman
from
france
now
sir
said
he
whose
messenger
may
you
be
eh
what
all
this
rotherby
the
earl
interrupted
in
a
voice
intended
to
be
compelling
come
away
caryll
he
added
quickly
i
not
have
any
gentleman
who
has
shown
himself
a
friend
to
my
ward
here
affronted
by
that
rascal
come
away
sir
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
ecod
it
was
another
voice
that
broke
in
upon
them
rotherby
started
round
gaskell
in
the
shadows
of
the
cowled
fireplace
jumped
in
sheer
alarm
all
stared
at
the
window
whence
the
voice
proceeded
they
beheld
a
plump
little
man
astride
the
sill
a
pistol
displayed
with
ostentation
in
his
hand
caryll
was
the
only
one
with
the
presence
of
mind
to
welcome
him
ha
said
he
smiling
engagingly
my
little
friend
the
brewer
of
let
no
one
leave
this
room
said
green
with
a
great
dignity
then
with
rather
less
dignity
he
whistled
shrilly
through
his
fingers
and
got
down
lightly
into
the
room
sir
blustered
the
earl
this
is
an
intrusion
an
impertinence
what
do
you
want
the
papers
this
gentleman
carries
said
green
indicating
caryll
with
the
hand
that
held
the
pistol
the
earl
looked
alarmed
which
was
foolish
in
him
thought
caryll
rotherby
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
after
the
fashion
of
one
who
masks
a
smile
ye
rightly
served
for
meddling
said
he
with
relish
out
with
them
the
chubby
man
demanded
ye
gain
nothing
by
resistance
so
do
be
obstinate
i
could
be
nothing
so
discourteous
said
caryll
would
it
be
prying
on
my
part
to
inquire
what
may
be
your
interest
in
my
papers
his
serenity
lessened
the
earl
anxieties
but
bewildered
him
and
it
took
the
edge
off
the
malicious
pleasure
which
rotherby
was
beginning
to
experience
i
am
obeying
the
orders
of
my
lord
carteret
the
secretary
of
state
said
green
i
was
to
watch
for
a
gentleman
from
france
with
letters
for
my
lord
ostermore
he
had
a
messenger
a
week
ago
to
tell
him
to
look
for
such
a
visitor
he
took
the
messenger
if
you
must
know
and
well
we
induced
him
to
tell
us
what
was
the
message
he
had
carried
there
is
so
much
mystery
in
all
this
that
my
lord
carteret
desires
more
knowledge
on
the
subject
i
think
you
are
the
gentleman
i
am
looking
caryll
looked
him
over
with
an
amused
eye
and
laughed
it
distresses
me
said
he
to
see
so
much
good
thought
green
was
abashed
a
moment
but
he
recovered
quickly
no
doubt
he
had
met
the
cool
type
before
come
come
said
he
no
blustering
out
with
your
papers
my
fine
the
door
opened
and
a
couple
of
men
came
in
over
their
shoulders
ere
the
door
closed
again
caryll
had
a
glimpse
of
the
landlady
rosy
face
alarm
in
her
glance
the
newcomers
were
dirty
rogues
tipstaves
recognizable
at
a
glance
one
of
them
wore
a
ragged
the
no
doubt
of
some
gentleman
gentleman
fished
out
of
the
sixpenny
tub
in
rosemary
lane
it
was
and
wisps
of
the
fellow
own
unkempt
hair
hung
out
in
places
the
other
wore
no
wig
at
all
his
yellow
thatch
fell
in
streaks
from
under
his
shabby
hat
which
he
had
the
to
retain
until
lord
ostermore
knocked
it
from
his
head
with
a
blow
of
his
cane
both
were
fierily
and
neither
appeared
to
have
shaved
for
a
week
or
so
now
quoth
green
will
you
hand
them
over
of
your
own
accord
or
must
i
have
you
searched
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
towards
the
advancing
myrmidons
indicated
the
searchers
you
go
too
far
sir
blustered
the
earl
ay
surely
put
in
caryll
you
are
mad
to
think
a
gentleman
is
to
submit
to
being
searched
by
any
knave
that
comes
to
him
with
a
tale
about
the
secretary
of
green
leered
again
and
produced
a
paper
there
said
he
is
my
lord
carteret
warrant
signed
and
caryll
glanced
over
it
with
a
disdainful
eye
it
is
in
blank
said
he
just
so
agreed
green
carte
blanche
as
you
say
over
the
water
if
you
insist
he
offered
obligingly
i
fill
in
your
name
before
we
caryll
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
might
be
well
said
he
if
you
are
to
search
me
at
green
advanced
to
the
table
the
writing
implements
provided
for
the
wedding
were
still
there
he
took
up
a
pen
scrawled
a
name
across
the
blank
dusted
it
with
sand
and
presented
it
again
to
caryll
the
latter
nodded
i
not
trouble
you
to
search
me
said
he
i
would
as
soon
not
have
these
noblemen
of
yours
for
my
he
thrust
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
fine
coat
and
brought
forth
several
papers
these
he
proffered
to
green
who
took
them
between
satisfaction
and
amazement
ostermore
stared
too
stricken
for
words
at
this
meek
surrender
and
well
was
it
for
caryll
that
he
was
so
stricken
for
had
he
spoken
he
had
assuredly
betrayed
himself
hortensia
caryll
observed
watched
his
cowardly
yielding
with
an
eye
of
stern
contempt
rotherby
looked
on
with
a
dark
face
that
betrayed
nothing
meanwhile
green
was
running
through
the
papers
and
as
fast
as
he
ran
through
them
he
permitted
himself
certain
comments
that
passed
for
humor
with
his
followers
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
in
his
own
social
stratum
green
must
have
been
accounted
something
of
a
wag
ha
what
this
a
bill
a
bill
for
snuff
my
lord
carteret
snuff
you
sir
he
tobacco
you
ecod
he
smoke
you
first
and
snuff
you
he
flung
the
bill
aside
phew
he
whistled
verses
theocritus
upon
sailing
for
albion
that
mighty
choice
d
write
verses
sir
heyday
is
an
occupation
to
which
i
have
succumbed
in
moments
of
weakness
i
crave
your
indulgence
green
perceived
that
here
was
a
weak
attempt
at
irony
and
went
on
with
his
investigations
he
came
to
the
last
of
the
papers
caryll
had
handed
him
glanced
at
it
swore
coarsely
and
dropped
it
d
think
ye
can
bubble
me
he
cried
red
in
the
face
lord
ostermore
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
the
hard
look
had
faded
from
hortensia
eyes
what
ye
mean
giving
me
this
rubbish
i
offer
you
my
excuses
for
the
contents
of
my
pockets
said
caryll
ye
see
i
did
not
expect
to
be
honored
by
your
inquisition
had
i
but
known
green
struck
an
attitude
now
attend
to
me
sir
i
am
a
servant
of
his
majesty
his
majesty
government
can
not
be
sufficiently
congratulated
said
caryll
the
irrepressible
green
banged
the
table
are
ye
rallying
me
ecod
you
have
upset
the
ink
caryll
pointed
out
to
him
damn
the
ink
swore
the
spy
and
damn
you
for
a
tom
o
bedlam
i
ask
you
again
what
d
mean
giving
me
this
rubbish
you
asked
me
to
turn
out
my
i
asked
you
for
the
letter
ye
have
brought
lord
i
am
sorry
said
caryll
and
eyed
the
other
sympathetically
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
then
you
assumed
too
much
when
you
assumed
that
i
had
such
a
letter
i
have
obliged
you
to
the
fullest
extent
in
my
power
i
do
not
think
you
show
a
becoming
green
eyed
him
blankly
a
moment
then
exploded
ecod
sir
you
are
it
is
a
condition
we
do
not
appear
to
d
say
ye
brought
his
lordship
no
letter
from
france
thundered
the
spy
what
else
ha
ye
come
to
england
for
to
study
manners
sir
said
caryll
bowing
that
was
the
last
drop
in
the
cup
of
green
endurance
he
waved
his
men
towards
the
gentleman
from
france
find
it
he
bade
them
shortly
caryll
drew
himself
up
with
a
great
dignity
and
waved
the
bailiffs
back
his
white
face
set
an
unpleasant
glimmer
in
his
eyes
a
moment
he
cried
you
have
no
authority
to
go
to
such
extremes
i
make
no
objection
to
being
searched
but
every
objection
to
being
soiled
and
i
not
have
the
fingers
of
these
scavengers
about
my
and
you
are
right
egad
cried
lord
ostermore
advancing
harkee
you
dirty
spy
this
is
no
way
to
deal
with
gentlemen
be
off
now
and
take
your
with
you
or
i
have
my
grooms
in
with
their
whips
to
to
me
roared
green
i
represent
the
secretary
of
ye
represent
a
side
of
raw
venison
if
you
tarry
here
the
earl
promised
him
d
dare
look
me
in
the
eye
d
dare
ye
rogue
d
know
who
i
am
and
do
wag
that
pistol
my
fine
fellow
be
off
now
away
with
you
green
looked
his
name
the
rosiness
was
all
departed
from
his
cheeks
he
quivered
with
suppressed
wrath
if
i
go
giving
way
to
constraint
what
shall
you
say
to
my
lord
carteret
he
asked
what
concern
may
that
be
of
yours
sirrah
it
will
be
some
concern
of
yours
my
caryll
interposed
the
knave
is
right
said
he
it
were
to
implicate
your
lordship
it
were
to
give
color
to
his
silly
suspicions
let
him
make
his
search
but
be
so
good
as
to
summon
my
valet
he
shall
hand
you
my
garments
that
you
may
do
your
will
upon
them
but
unless
you
justify
yourself
by
finding
the
letter
you
are
seeking
you
shall
have
to
reckon
with
the
consequences
of
discomposing
a
gentleman
for
nothing
now
sir
is
it
a
bargain
green
looked
him
over
and
if
he
was
shaken
by
the
calm
assurance
of
caryll
tone
and
manner
he
concealed
it
very
effectively
we
make
no
bargains
said
he
i
have
my
duty
to
he
signed
to
one
of
the
bailiffs
fetch
the
gentleman
servant
said
he
so
be
it
said
caryll
but
you
take
too
much
upon
yourself
sir
your
duty
i
think
would
have
been
to
arrest
me
and
carry
me
to
lord
carteret
there
to
be
searched
if
his
lordship
considered
it
i
have
no
cause
to
arrest
you
until
i
find
it
green
snapped
impatiently
your
logic
is
i
am
following
my
lord
carteret
orders
to
the
letter
i
am
to
effect
no
arrest
until
i
have
positive
yet
you
are
detaining
me
what
does
this
amount
to
but
an
arrest
green
disdained
to
answer
leduc
entered
and
caryll
turned
to
lord
ostermore
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
detain
your
lordship
said
he
and
these
operations
the
lady
he
waved
an
expressive
hand
bent
an
expressive
eye
upon
the
earl
lord
ostermore
seemed
to
waver
he
was
not
he
had
never
been
a
man
to
think
for
others
but
hortensia
cut
in
before
he
could
reply
we
will
wait
she
said
since
you
are
travelling
to
town
i
am
sure
his
lordship
will
be
glad
of
your
company
caryll
looked
deep
into
those
great
brown
eyes
and
bowed
his
thanks
if
it
will
not
discompose
your
lordship
no
no
said
ostermore
gruff
of
voice
and
manner
we
will
wait
i
shall
be
honored
sir
if
you
will
journey
with
us
caryll
bowed
again
and
went
to
hold
the
door
for
them
eyes
keenly
alert
for
an
attempt
at
evasion
but
there
was
none
when
his
lordship
and
his
ward
had
departed
caryll
turned
to
rotherby
who
had
taken
a
chair
his
man
gaskell
behind
him
he
looked
from
the
viscount
to
green
do
we
require
this
gentleman
he
asked
the
spy
a
smile
broke
over
rotherby
swam
face
by
your
leave
sir
remain
to
see
fair
play
you
may
find
me
useful
green
i
have
no
cause
to
wish
this
marplot
well
he
explained
caryll
turned
his
back
upon
him
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
he
sat
down
while
green
spread
the
garments
upon
the
table
emptied
out
the
pockets
turned
down
the
cuffs
ripped
up
the
satin
linings
he
did
it
in
a
consummate
fashion
very
thoroughly
yet
though
he
parted
the
linings
from
the
cloth
he
did
so
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
the
garments
easily
repairable
caryll
watched
him
with
interest
and
appreciation
and
what
time
he
watched
he
was
wondering
might
it
not
be
better
straightway
to
place
the
spy
in
possession
of
the
letter
and
thus
destroy
himself
and
lord
ostermore
at
the
same
time
and
have
done
with
the
task
on
which
he
was
come
to
england
it
seemed
almost
an
easy
way
out
of
the
affair
his
betrayal
of
the
earl
would
be
less
ugly
if
he
himself
were
to
share
the
consequences
of
that
betrayal
then
he
checked
his
thoughts
what
manner
of
mood
was
this
besides
his
inclination
was
all
to
become
better
acquainted
with
this
odd
family
upon
which
he
had
stumbled
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
down
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
thing
he
was
come
to
do
would
never
be
done
leastways
not
by
him
it
was
in
vain
that
he
might
attempt
to
steel
himself
to
the
task
it
repelled
him
it
went
not
with
a
nature
such
as
his
he
thought
of
everard
afire
with
the
idea
of
vengence
and
to
such
an
extent
that
he
had
succeeded
in
infecting
justin
himself
with
a
spark
of
it
he
thought
of
him
with
pity
almost
pity
that
a
man
should
obsess
his
life
by
such
a
phantasm
as
this
same
vengeance
must
have
been
to
him
was
it
worth
while
was
anything
worth
while
he
wondered
lord
rotherby
approached
the
table
and
took
up
the
garments
upon
which
green
had
finished
he
turned
them
over
and
supplemented
search
ye
welcome
to
all
that
ye
can
find
sneered
green
and
turned
to
caryll
let
us
have
your
shoes
caryll
removed
his
shoes
in
silence
and
green
proceeded
to
examine
them
in
a
manner
that
provoked
caryll
profound
admiration
he
separated
the
lining
from
the
spanish
leather
and
probed
slowly
and
carefully
in
the
space
between
he
examined
the
heels
very
closely
going
over
to
the
window
for
the
purpose
that
done
he
dropped
them
your
breeches
now
said
he
laconically
meanwhile
leduc
had
taken
up
the
coat
and
with
a
needle
and
thread
wherewith
he
had
equipped
himself
he
was
industriously
restoring
the
stitches
that
green
had
taken
out
caryll
surrendered
his
breeches
his
fine
holland
shirt
went
next
his
stockings
and
what
other
trifles
he
wore
until
he
stood
as
naked
as
adam
before
the
fall
yet
all
in
vain
his
garments
were
restored
to
him
one
by
one
and
one
by
one
with
leduc
aid
he
resumed
them
green
was
looking
crestfallen
are
you
satisfied
inquired
caryll
pleasantly
his
good
temper
inexhaustible
the
spy
looked
at
him
with
a
moody
eye
plucking
thoughtfully
at
his
lip
with
thumb
and
forefinger
then
he
brightened
suddenly
there
your
man
said
he
flashing
a
quick
eye
upon
leduc
who
looked
up
with
a
quiet
smile
true
said
caryll
and
there
my
portmantle
and
my
saddle
on
my
horse
in
the
stables
it
is
even
possible
for
aught
you
know
that
there
may
be
a
hollow
tooth
or
two
in
my
head
pray
let
your
search
be
green
considered
him
again
if
you
had
it
it
would
be
upon
your
yet
consider
caryll
begged
him
holding
out
his
foot
that
leduc
might
put
on
his
shoe
again
i
might
have
supposed
that
you
would
suppose
that
and
disposed
accordingly
you
had
better
investigate
to
the
bitter
green
small
eyes
continued
to
scrutinize
leduc
at
intervals
the
valet
was
a
silent
fellow
i
search
your
servant
leastways
the
spy
announced
by
all
means
leduc
i
beg
that
you
will
place
yourself
at
this
interesting
gentleman
what
time
caryll
unaided
now
completed
the
resumption
of
his
garments
leduc
silent
and
expressionless
submitted
to
being
searched
you
will
observe
leduc
said
caryll
that
we
have
not
come
to
this
country
in
vain
we
are
undergoing
experiences
that
would
be
interesting
if
they
were
not
quite
so
dull
amusing
if
they
entailed
less
discomfort
to
ourselves
assuredly
it
was
worth
while
to
cross
to
england
to
study
manners
and
there
are
sights
for
you
that
you
will
never
see
in
france
you
would
not
for
instance
had
you
not
come
hither
have
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
a
member
of
the
noblesse
seconding
and
assisting
a
tipstaff
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
and
doing
it
just
as
a
hog
wallows
in
foulness
for
the
love
of
it
the
gentlemen
in
your
country
leduc
are
too
fastidious
to
enjoy
life
as
it
should
be
enjoyed
they
are
too
prone
to
adhere
to
the
amusements
of
their
class
you
have
here
an
opportunity
of
perceiving
how
deeply
they
are
mistaken
what
relish
may
lie
in
setting
one
rank
on
one
side
in
forgetting
at
times
that
by
an
accident
a
sheer
incredible
accident
i
assure
you
leduc
one
may
have
been
born
to
a
rotherby
had
drawn
himself
up
his
dark
face
crimsoning
d
talk
at
me
sir
he
demanded
d
dare
discuss
me
with
your
lackey
but
why
not
since
you
search
me
with
my
tipstaff
if
you
can
perceive
a
difference
you
are
too
subtle
for
me
rotherby
advanced
a
step
then
checked
he
inherited
mental
sluggishness
from
his
father
you
are
insolent
he
charged
caryll
you
insult
indeed
ha
i
am
working
rotherby
governed
his
anger
by
an
effort
there
was
enough
between
us
without
this
said
he
there
could
not
be
too
much
between
us
too
much
space
i
the
viscount
looked
at
him
furiously
i
shall
discuss
this
further
with
you
said
he
the
present
is
not
the
time
nor
place
but
i
shall
know
where
to
look
for
leduc
i
am
sure
will
always
be
pleased
to
see
you
he
too
is
studying
rotherby
ignored
the
insult
we
shall
see
then
whether
you
can
do
anything
more
than
i
hope
that
your
lordship
too
is
master
of
other
accomplishments
as
a
talker
i
do
not
find
you
very
gifted
but
perhaps
leduc
will
be
less
exigent
than
bah
his
lordship
flung
at
him
and
went
out
cursing
him
profusely
gaskell
following
at
his
master
heels
chapter
moonshine
my
lord
ostermore
though
puzzled
entertained
no
tormenting
anxiety
on
the
score
of
the
search
to
which
caryll
was
to
be
submitted
he
assured
himself
from
that
gentleman
confident
easy
manner
being
a
man
who
always
drew
from
things
the
inference
that
was
obvious
that
either
he
carried
no
such
letter
as
my
lord
expected
or
else
he
had
so
disposed
of
it
as
to
baffle
search
so
for
the
moment
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
with
hortensia
he
entered
the
parlor
across
the
passage
to
which
the
landlady
ushered
them
and
turned
to
the
matter
of
his
ward
elopement
with
his
son
hortensia
said
he
when
they
were
alone
you
have
been
foolish
very
he
had
a
trick
of
repeating
himself
conceiving
no
doubt
that
the
commonplace
achieves
distinction
by
repetition
hortensia
sat
in
an
by
the
window
and
sighed
looking
out
over
the
downs
do
i
not
know
it
she
cried
and
the
eyes
which
were
averted
from
his
lordship
were
charred
with
tears
tears
of
hot
anger
shame
and
mortification
god
help
all
women
she
added
bitterly
after
a
moment
as
many
another
woman
under
similar
and
worse
circumstances
has
cried
before
and
since
a
more
feeling
man
might
have
conceived
that
this
was
a
moment
in
which
to
leave
her
to
herself
and
her
own
thoughts
and
in
that
it
is
possible
that
a
more
feeling
man
had
been
mistaken
ostermore
stolid
and
unimaginative
but
not
altogether
without
sympathy
for
his
ward
of
whom
he
was
reasonably
fond
as
fond
no
doubt
as
it
was
his
capacity
to
be
for
any
other
than
himself
approached
her
and
set
a
plump
hand
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
what
was
it
drove
you
to
this
she
turned
upon
him
almost
fiercely
my
lady
ostermore
she
answered
him
his
lordship
frowned
and
his
eyes
shifted
uneasily
from
her
face
in
his
heart
he
disliked
his
wife
excessively
disliked
her
because
she
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
governed
him
who
rode
over
his
feelings
and
desires
because
perhaps
she
was
the
mother
of
his
unfeeling
detestable
son
she
may
not
have
been
the
only
person
living
to
despise
lord
ostermore
but
she
was
certainly
the
only
one
with
the
courage
to
manifest
her
contempt
and
that
in
no
circumscribed
terms
and
yet
disliking
her
as
he
did
returning
with
interest
her
contempt
of
him
he
veiled
it
and
was
loyal
to
his
termagant
never
suffering
himself
to
utter
a
complaint
of
her
to
others
never
suffering
others
to
censure
her
within
his
hearing
this
loyalty
may
have
had
its
roots
in
pride
indeed
no
other
soil
can
be
assigned
to
them
a
pride
that
would
allow
no
strangers
to
pry
into
the
sore
places
of
his
being
he
frowned
now
to
hear
hortensia
angry
mention
of
her
ladyship
name
and
if
his
blue
eyes
moved
uneasily
under
his
beetling
brows
it
was
because
the
situation
irked
him
how
should
he
stand
as
judge
between
mistress
winthrop
towards
whom
as
we
have
seen
he
had
a
kindness
and
his
wife
whom
he
hated
yet
towards
whom
he
would
not
be
disloyal
he
wished
the
subject
dropped
since
did
he
ask
the
obvious
question
in
what
my
lady
ostermore
could
have
been
the
cause
of
hortensia
flight
he
would
provoke
he
knew
a
storm
of
censure
from
his
wife
therefore
he
fell
silent
hortensia
however
felt
that
she
had
said
too
much
not
to
say
more
her
ladyship
has
never
failed
to
make
me
feel
my
position
my
my
poverty
she
pursued
there
is
no
slight
her
ladyship
has
not
put
upon
me
until
not
even
your
servants
use
me
with
the
respect
that
is
due
to
my
father
daughter
and
my
father
she
added
with
a
reproachful
glance
was
your
friend
my
he
shifted
uncomfortably
on
his
feet
deploring
now
the
question
with
which
he
had
fired
the
train
of
feminine
complaint
pish
pish
he
deprecated
is
fancy
child
pure
fancy
so
her
ladyship
would
say
did
you
tax
her
with
it
yet
your
lordship
knows
i
am
not
fanciful
in
other
things
should
i
then
be
fanciful
in
this
but
what
has
her
ladyship
ever
done
child
he
demanded
thinking
thus
to
baffle
her
since
he
was
acquainted
with
the
subtlety
of
her
ladyship
methods
a
thousand
things
replied
hortensia
hotly
and
yet
not
one
upon
which
i
may
fasten
is
thus
she
works
by
words
looks
sneers
shrugs
and
sometimes
foul
abuse
entirely
disproportionate
to
the
little
cause
i
may
unwittingly
have
her
ladyship
is
a
little
hot
the
earl
admitted
but
a
good
heart
an
excellent
heart
for
my
nay
plague
o
that
womanish
in
you
honor
it
is
womanish
what
else
would
you
have
a
woman
mannish
and
raffish
like
my
lady
ostermore
i
not
listen
to
you
he
said
ye
not
just
hortensia
heated
heated
i
not
listen
to
you
besides
when
all
is
said
what
reasons
be
these
for
the
folly
ye
committed
reasons
she
echoed
scornfully
reasons
and
to
spare
her
ladyship
has
made
my
life
so
hard
has
so
shamed
and
crushed
me
put
such
indignities
upon
me
that
existence
grew
unbearable
under
your
roof
it
could
not
continue
my
lord
she
pursued
rising
under
the
sway
of
her
indignation
it
could
not
continue
i
am
not
of
the
stuff
that
goes
to
making
martyrs
i
am
weak
and
and
as
your
lordship
has
said
indeed
you
talk
a
deal
said
his
lordship
peevishly
but
she
did
not
heed
the
sarcasm
lord
rotherby
she
continued
offered
me
the
means
to
escape
he
urged
me
to
elope
with
him
his
reason
was
that
you
would
never
consent
to
our
marriage
but
that
if
we
took
the
matter
into
our
hands
and
were
married
first
we
might
depend
upon
your
sanction
afterwards
that
you
had
too
great
a
kindness
for
me
to
withhold
your
pardon
i
was
weak
my
lord
womanish
she
threw
the
word
at
him
again
and
it
happened
god
help
me
for
a
fool
that
i
thought
i
loved
lord
rotherby
and
so
and
so
she
sat
down
again
weakly
miserably
averting
her
face
that
she
might
hide
her
tears
he
was
touched
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
show
something
of
his
sympathy
he
approached
her
again
and
laid
a
benign
hand
lightly
upon
her
shoulder
but
but
in
that
case
oh
the
damned
villain
why
this
does
your
lordship
not
perceive
must
i
die
of
shame
do
you
not
see
see
no
he
was
thoughtful
a
second
then
repeated
no
i
understood
she
informed
him
a
smile
a
cruelly
bitter
smile
lifting
and
steadying
the
corner
of
her
lately
quivering
lip
when
he
alluded
to
your
lordship
straitened
circumstances
he
has
no
disinheritance
to
fear
because
he
has
no
inheritance
to
look
for
beyond
the
entail
of
which
you
can
not
disinherit
him
my
lord
rotherby
sets
a
high
value
upon
himself
he
may
i
do
not
know
he
may
have
been
in
love
with
me
though
not
as
i
know
love
which
is
all
sacrifice
all
but
by
his
lights
he
may
have
cared
for
me
he
must
have
done
by
his
lights
had
i
been
a
lady
of
fortune
not
a
doubt
but
he
would
have
made
me
his
wife
as
it
was
he
must
aim
at
a
more
profitable
marriage
and
meanwhile
to
gratify
his
love
for
me
base
as
it
was
he
would
he
would
o
god
i
can
not
say
it
you
understand
my
my
lord
swore
strenuously
there
is
a
punishment
for
such
a
crime
as
ay
my
lord
and
a
way
to
avoid
punishment
for
a
gentleman
in
your
son
position
even
did
i
flaunt
my
shame
in
some
vain
endeavor
to
have
justice
a
thing
he
knew
i
never
could
have
my
lord
swore
again
he
shall
be
punished
he
declared
emphatically
no
doubt
god
will
see
to
that
she
said
a
world
of
faith
in
her
quivering
voice
my
lord
eyes
expressed
his
doubt
of
divine
intervention
he
preferred
to
speak
for
himself
i
disown
the
dog
he
shall
not
enter
my
house
again
you
shall
not
be
reminded
of
what
has
happened
here
gad
you
were
shrewd
to
have
smoked
his
motives
so
he
cried
in
a
burst
of
admiration
for
her
insight
gad
child
shouldst
have
been
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
if
it
had
not
been
for
caryll
she
began
but
to
what
else
she
said
he
lent
no
ear
being
suddenly
brought
back
to
his
fears
at
the
mention
of
that
gentleman
name
mr
caryll
save
us
what
is
keeping
him
he
cried
can
they
can
they
the
door
opened
and
caryll
walked
in
ushered
by
the
hostess
both
turned
to
confront
him
hortensia
eyes
swollen
from
her
weeping
well
quoth
his
lordship
did
they
find
nothing
caryll
advanced
with
the
easy
graceful
carriage
that
was
one
of
his
main
charms
his
clothes
so
skilfully
restored
by
leduc
that
none
could
have
guessed
the
severity
of
the
examination
they
had
undergone
since
i
am
here
and
alone
your
lordship
may
conclude
such
to
be
the
case
green
is
preparing
for
departure
he
is
very
abject
very
i
am
almost
sorry
for
green
i
am
by
nature
sympathetic
i
have
promised
to
make
my
complaint
to
my
lord
carteret
and
so
i
trust
there
is
an
end
to
a
tiresome
but
then
sir
quoth
his
lordship
but
then
are
you
the
bearer
of
no
letter
caryll
shot
a
swift
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
door
he
deliberately
winked
at
the
earl
did
your
lordship
expect
letters
he
inquired
that
was
scarcely
reason
enough
to
suppose
me
a
courier
there
is
some
mistake
i
between
the
wink
and
the
words
his
lordship
was
bewildered
caryll
turned
to
the
lady
bowing
then
he
waved
a
hand
over
the
downs
a
fine
view
said
he
airily
and
she
stared
at
him
i
shall
treasure
sweet
memories
of
her
stare
grew
stonier
did
he
mean
the
landscape
or
some
other
matter
his
tone
was
difficult
to
read
a
feature
peculiar
to
his
tone
not
so
shall
i
sir
she
made
answer
i
shall
never
think
of
it
other
than
with
burning
cheeks
unless
it
be
with
gratitude
to
your
shrewdness
which
saved
no
more
i
beg
it
is
a
matter
painful
to
you
to
dwell
on
let
me
exhort
you
to
forget
it
i
have
already
done
that
is
a
sweet
courtesy
in
i
am
compounded
of
sweet
courtesy
he
informed
her
modestly
his
lordship
spoke
of
departure
renewing
his
offer
to
carry
caryll
to
town
in
his
chaise
meanwhile
caryll
was
behaving
curiously
he
was
tiptoeing
towards
the
door
along
the
wall
where
he
was
out
of
line
with
the
keyhole
he
reached
it
suddenly
and
abruptly
pulled
it
open
there
was
a
squeal
and
green
rolled
forward
into
the
room
caryll
kicked
him
out
again
before
he
could
rise
and
called
leduc
to
throw
him
outside
and
that
was
the
last
they
saw
of
green
at
maidstone
they
set
out
soon
afterwards
caryll
travelling
in
his
chaise
and
leduc
following
in
his
master
it
was
an
hour
or
so
after
time
when
they
reached
croydon
the
country
lying
all
white
under
a
full
moon
that
sailed
in
a
clear
calm
sky
his
lordship
swore
that
he
would
go
no
farther
that
night
the
travelling
fatigued
him
indeed
for
the
last
few
miles
of
the
journey
he
had
been
dozing
in
his
corner
of
the
carriage
conversation
having
long
since
been
abandoned
as
too
great
an
effort
on
so
bad
a
road
which
shook
and
jolted
them
beyond
endurance
his
lordship
chaise
was
of
an
pattern
and
the
springs
far
from
what
might
have
been
desired
or
expected
in
a
conveyance
they
alighted
at
the
his
lordship
bespoke
supper
invited
caryll
to
join
them
and
what
time
the
meal
was
preparing
went
into
a
noisy
doze
in
the
parlor
best
chair
mistress
winthrop
sauntered
out
into
the
garden
the
calm
and
fragrance
of
the
night
invited
her
alone
with
her
thoughts
she
paced
the
lawn
a
while
until
her
solitude
was
disturbed
by
the
advent
of
caryll
he
too
had
need
to
think
and
he
had
come
out
into
the
peace
of
the
night
to
indulge
his
need
seeing
her
he
made
as
if
to
withdraw
again
but
she
perceived
him
and
called
him
to
her
side
he
went
most
readily
yet
when
he
stood
before
her
in
an
attitude
of
courteous
deference
she
was
at
a
loss
what
she
should
say
to
him
or
rather
what
words
she
should
employ
at
last
with
a
of
nervousness
i
am
by
nature
very
inquisitive
sir
she
prefaced
i
had
already
judged
you
to
be
an
exceptional
woman
caryll
commented
softly
she
mused
an
instant
are
you
never
serious
she
asked
him
is
it
worth
while
he
and
whether
intent
or
accident
he
let
her
see
something
of
himself
is
it
even
amusing
to
be
serious
is
there
in
life
nothing
but
amusement
oh
yes
but
nothing
so
vital
i
speak
with
knowledge
the
gift
of
laughter
has
been
my
from
what
sir
ah
who
shall
say
that
my
history
and
my
rearing
have
been
such
that
had
i
bowed
before
them
i
had
become
the
most
gloomy
melancholy
man
that
steps
this
gloomy
melancholy
world
by
now
i
might
have
found
existence
insupportable
and
so
who
knows
i
might
have
set
a
term
to
it
but
i
had
the
wisdom
to
prefer
laughter
humanity
is
a
delectable
spectacle
if
we
but
have
the
gift
to
observe
it
in
a
dispassionate
spirit
such
a
gift
have
i
cultivated
the
squirming
of
the
human
worm
is
interesting
to
observe
and
the
practice
of
observing
it
has
this
advantage
that
while
we
observe
it
we
forget
to
squirm
the
bitterness
of
your
words
belies
their
he
shrugged
and
smiled
but
proves
my
contention
that
i
might
explain
myself
you
made
me
for
a
moment
serious
set
me
squirming
in
my
she
moved
a
little
and
he
fell
into
step
beside
her
a
little
while
there
was
silence
presently
you
find
me
no
doubt
as
amusing
as
any
other
of
your
human
worms
said
she
god
forbid
he
answered
soberly
she
laughed
you
make
an
exception
in
my
case
then
that
is
a
subtle
flattery
have
i
not
said
that
i
had
judged
you
to
be
an
exceptional
woman
exceptionally
foolish
not
a
exceptionally
beautiful
exceptionally
admirable
he
corrected
a
clumsy
compliment
devoid
of
wit
when
we
grow
truthful
it
may
be
forgiven
us
if
we
fall
short
of
that
were
an
argument
in
favor
of
avoiding
were
it
necessary
said
he
for
truth
is
seldom
so
intrusive
as
to
need
avoiding
but
we
are
straying
there
was
a
score
upon
which
you
were
inquisitive
you
said
from
which
i
take
it
that
you
sought
knowledge
at
my
hands
pray
seek
it
i
am
a
well
of
i
desired
to
know
nay
but
i
have
asked
you
already
i
desired
to
know
did
you
deem
me
a
very
pitiful
little
fool
they
had
reached
the
privet
hedge
and
turned
they
paused
now
before
resuming
their
walk
he
paused
also
before
replying
then
i
should
judge
you
wise
in
most
things
he
answered
slowly
critically
but
in
the
matter
to
which
i
owe
the
blessing
of
having
served
you
i
do
not
think
you
wise
did
you
do
you
love
lord
rotherby
what
if
so
after
what
you
have
learned
i
should
account
you
still
less
you
are
impertinent
sir
she
reproved
him
nay
most
pertinent
did
you
not
ask
me
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
this
matter
and
unless
you
confess
to
me
how
am
i
to
absolve
you
i
did
not
crave
your
absolution
you
take
too
much
upon
so
said
lord
rotherby
you
seem
to
have
something
in
common
when
all
is
she
bit
her
lip
in
chagrin
they
paced
in
silence
to
the
lawn
end
and
turned
again
then
you
treat
me
like
a
fool
she
reproved
him
how
is
that
possible
when
already
i
think
i
love
she
started
from
him
and
stared
at
him
for
a
long
moment
you
insult
me
she
cried
angrily
conceiving
that
she
understood
his
mind
do
you
think
that
because
i
may
have
committed
a
folly
i
have
forfeited
all
claim
to
be
respected
that
i
am
a
subject
for
insolent
speeches
you
are
illogical
said
caryll
the
imperturbable
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you
should
i
insult
the
woman
i
have
said
i
love
you
love
me
she
looked
at
him
her
face
very
white
in
the
white
moonlight
her
lips
parted
a
kindling
anger
in
her
eyes
are
you
mad
i
sure
there
have
been
moments
when
i
have
almost
feared
it
this
is
not
one
of
you
wish
me
to
think
you
serious
she
laughed
a
thought
stridently
in
her
indignation
i
have
known
you
just
four
hours
said
she
precisely
the
time
i
think
i
have
loved
you
think
she
echoed
scornfully
oh
you
make
that
reservation
you
are
not
quite
sure
can
we
be
sure
of
anything
he
deprecated
of
some
things
she
answered
icily
and
i
am
sure
of
one
that
i
am
beginning
to
understand
i
envy
you
since
that
is
so
help
me
of
your
charity
to
understand
then
understand
yourself
for
an
impudent
fleering
coxcomb
she
flung
at
him
and
turned
to
leave
him
that
is
not
explanation
said
caryll
thoughtfully
it
is
mere
what
else
do
you
deserve
she
asked
him
over
her
shoulder
that
you
should
have
dared
she
withered
him
to
love
you
quite
so
suddenly
he
inquired
and
misquoted
loved
at
all
that
loved
not
at
first
sight
hortensia
you
have
not
the
right
to
my
name
yet
i
offer
you
the
right
to
mine
he
answered
with
humble
reproach
you
shall
be
punished
she
promised
him
and
in
high
dudgeon
left
him
punished
oh
cruel
can
you
then
be
to
him
who
smooth
to
thee
tigers
and
bears
i
heard
some
say
for
proffered
love
will
love
but
she
was
gone
he
looked
up
at
the
moon
and
took
it
into
his
confidence
to
reproach
it
was
your
white
face
beglamored
me
he
told
it
aloud
see
how
execrable
a
beginning
i
made
and
therefore
how
excellent
and
he
laughed
but
entirely
without
mirth
he
remained
pacing
in
the
moonlight
very
thoughtful
and
for
once
it
seemed
not
at
all
amused
his
life
appeared
to
be
tangling
itself
beyond
unravelling
and
his
vaunted
habit
of
laughter
scarce
served
at
present
to
show
him
the
way
out
chapter
vi
hortensia
return
caryll
needs
explaining
as
he
walks
there
in
the
moonlight
that
is
if
we
are
at
all
to
understand
him
a
matter
by
no
means
easy
considering
that
he
has
confessed
he
did
not
understand
himself
did
ever
man
make
a
sincere
declaration
of
sudden
passion
as
flippantly
as
he
had
done
or
in
calculated
to
alienate
the
regard
he
sought
to
win
did
ever
man
choose
his
time
with
less
discrimination
or
his
words
with
less
discretion
assuredly
not
to
suppose
that
caryll
was
unaware
of
this
would
be
to
suppose
him
a
fool
and
that
he
most
certainly
was
not
his
mood
was
extremely
complex
its
analysis
i
fear
may
baffle
us
it
must
have
seemed
to
you
as
it
certainly
seemed
to
mistress
winthrop
that
he
made
a
mock
of
her
that
in
truth
he
was
the
impudent
fleering
coxcomb
she
pronounced
him
and
nothing
more
not
so
mock
he
most
certainly
did
but
his
mockery
was
all
aimed
to
strike
himself
on
the
recoil
himself
and
the
sentiments
which
had
sprung
to
being
in
his
soul
and
to
which
nameless
as
he
was
pledged
as
he
was
to
a
task
that
would
most
likely
involve
his
ruin
he
conceived
that
he
had
no
right
he
gave
expression
to
his
feelings
yet
chose
for
them
the
expression
best
calculated
to
render
them
barren
of
all
consequence
where
mistress
winthrop
was
concerned
where
another
would
have
hidden
those
emotions
caryll
elected
to
flaunt
them
that
hortensia
might
trample
them
under
foot
in
sheer
disgust
it
was
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
did
he
wait
and
come
to
her
as
an
honest
devout
lover
he
must
in
honesty
tell
her
all
there
was
to
know
of
his
odd
history
and
of
his
bastardy
and
thus
set
up
between
them
a
barrier
insurmountable
better
he
may
have
thought
to
make
from
the
outset
a
mockery
of
a
passion
for
which
there
could
be
no
hope
and
so
under
that
mocking
impertinent
exterior
i
hope
you
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
real
suffering
man
the
man
who
boasted
that
he
had
the
gift
of
laughter
he
continued
a
while
to
pace
the
dewy
lawn
after
she
had
left
him
and
a
deep
despondency
descended
upon
the
spirit
of
this
man
who
accounted
seriousness
a
folly
hitherto
his
rancor
against
his
father
had
been
a
theoretical
rancor
a
thing
educated
into
him
by
everard
and
accepted
by
him
as
we
accept
a
proposition
in
euclid
that
is
proved
to
us
in
its
way
it
had
been
a
rancor
a
rancor
on
principle
for
he
had
been
made
to
see
that
unless
he
was
inflamed
by
it
he
was
not
worthy
to
be
his
mother
son
tonight
had
changed
all
this
no
longer
was
his
grievance
sentimental
theoretical
or
abstract
it
was
suddenly
become
real
and
very
bitter
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
the
wrong
done
his
mother
thirty
years
ago
it
became
the
question
of
a
wrong
done
himself
in
casting
him
nameless
upon
the
world
a
thing
of
scorn
to
cruel
unjust
humanity
could
mistress
winthrop
have
guessed
the
bitter
with
which
he
had
in
apparent
levity
offered
her
his
name
she
might
have
felt
some
pity
for
him
who
had
no
pity
for
himself
and
so
he
felt
as
once
for
a
moment
everard
had
made
him
feel
that
he
had
a
very
real
wrong
of
his
own
to
avenge
upon
his
father
and
the
task
before
him
lost
much
of
the
repugnance
that
it
had
held
for
him
hitherto
all
this
because
four
hours
ago
he
had
looked
into
the
brown
depths
of
mistress
winthrop
eyes
he
sighed
and
declaimed
a
line
of
congreve
is
a
fair
image
in
a
pool
who
leaps
at
it
is
sunk
the
landlord
came
to
bid
him
in
to
supper
he
excused
himself
sent
his
lordship
word
that
he
was
and
went
off
to
bed
they
met
at
breakfast
at
an
early
hour
upon
the
morrow
mistress
winthrop
cool
and
distant
his
lordship
grumpy
and
mute
caryll
airy
and
talkative
as
was
his
habit
they
set
out
soon
afterwards
but
matters
were
nowise
improved
his
lordship
dozed
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
while
mistress
winthrop
found
more
interest
in
the
flowering
hedgerows
than
in
caryll
ignored
him
when
he
talked
and
did
not
answer
him
when
he
set
questions
till
in
the
end
he
too
lapsed
into
silence
and
as
a
solatium
for
his
soreness
assured
himself
by
lengthy
wordless
arguments
that
matters
were
best
so
they
entered
the
outlying
parts
of
london
some
two
hours
later
and
it
still
wanted
an
hour
or
so
to
noon
when
the
chaise
brought
up
inside
the
railings
before
the
earl
house
in
lincoln
inn
fields
there
came
a
rush
of
footmen
a
bustle
of
service
amid
which
they
alighted
and
entered
the
splendid
residence
that
was
part
of
the
little
that
remained
lord
ostermore
from
the
wreck
his
fortunes
had
suffered
on
the
shoals
of
the
south
sea
caryll
paused
a
moment
to
dismiss
leduc
to
the
address
in
old
palace
yard
where
he
had
hired
a
lodging
that
done
he
followed
his
lordship
and
hortensia
within
doors
from
the
inner
hall
a
footman
ushered
him
across
an
to
a
room
on
the
right
which
proved
to
be
the
library
and
was
his
lordship
habitual
retreat
it
was
a
spacious
pillared
chamber
very
richly
panelled
in
damask
silk
and
very
richly
furnished
having
long
french
windows
that
opened
on
a
terrace
above
the
garden
as
they
entered
there
came
a
swift
rustle
of
petticoats
at
their
heels
and
caryll
stood
aside
bowing
to
give
passage
to
a
tall
lady
who
swept
by
with
no
more
regard
for
him
than
had
he
been
one
of
the
house
lackeys
she
was
he
observed
of
lean
and
with
an
exaggerated
chin
that
ended
squarely
as
boot
her
sallow
cheeks
were
raddled
to
a
hectic
color
a
monstrous
like
that
of
some
horse
in
a
lord
mayor
show
coiffed
her
and
her
dress
was
a
mixture
of
extravagance
and
incongruity
the
petticoat
absurdly
hooped
she
swept
into
the
room
like
a
battleship
into
action
and
let
fly
her
first
broadside
at
mistress
winthrop
from
the
threshold
codso
she
shrilled
you
have
come
back
and
for
what
have
you
come
back
am
i
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
you
you
shameless
madam
that
have
no
more
thought
for
your
reputation
than
a
slut
in
a
hortensia
raised
indignant
eyes
from
out
of
a
face
that
was
very
pale
her
lips
were
tightly
pressed
in
resolution
thought
caryll
who
was
very
observant
of
her
not
to
answer
her
ladyship
for
caryll
had
little
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
this
dragon
my
love
my
dear
began
his
lordship
advancing
a
step
his
tone
a
very
salve
then
seeking
to
create
a
diversion
he
waved
a
hand
towards
caryll
let
me
present
did
i
speak
to
you
she
turned
to
bombard
him
have
you
not
done
harm
enough
had
you
been
aught
but
a
fool
had
you
respected
me
as
a
husband
should
you
had
left
well
alone
and
let
her
go
her
there
was
my
duty
to
her
father
to
say
aught
of
and
what
of
your
duty
to
me
she
blazed
her
eyes
puckering
most
malignantly
she
reminded
caryll
of
nothing
so
much
as
a
vulture
had
ye
forgotten
that
have
ye
no
thought
for
decency
no
respect
for
your
wife
her
strident
voice
was
echoing
through
the
house
and
drawing
a
little
crowd
of
gaping
servants
to
the
hall
to
spare
mistress
winthrop
caryll
took
it
upon
himself
to
close
the
door
the
countess
turned
at
the
sound
who
is
this
she
asked
measuring
the
elegant
figure
with
an
evil
eye
and
caryll
felt
it
in
his
bones
that
she
had
done
him
the
honor
to
dislike
him
at
sight
it
is
a
gentleman
who
who
his
lordship
thought
it
better
apparently
not
to
explain
the
exact
circumstances
under
which
he
had
met
the
gentleman
he
shifted
ground
i
was
about
to
present
him
my
love
it
is
caryll
justin
caryll
this
sir
is
my
lady
caryll
made
her
a
profound
bow
her
ladyship
retorted
with
a
sniff
is
it
a
kinsman
of
yours
my
lord
and
the
contempt
of
the
question
was
laden
with
a
suggestion
that
smote
caryll
hard
what
she
implied
in
wanton
offensive
mockery
was
no
more
than
he
alone
present
knew
to
be
the
exact
and
hideous
truth
some
remote
kinsman
i
make
no
doubt
the
earl
explained
until
yesterday
i
had
not
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
caryll
is
from
ye
be
a
jacobite
no
doubt
then
were
her
first
uncompromising
words
to
the
guest
caryll
made
her
another
bow
if
i
were
i
should
make
no
secret
of
it
with
your
ladyship
he
answered
with
that
irritating
suavity
in
which
he
clothed
his
most
obvious
sarcasms
her
ladyship
opened
her
eyes
a
little
wider
here
was
a
tone
she
was
unused
to
and
what
may
your
business
with
his
lordship
be
his
lordship
business
i
think
answered
caryll
in
a
tone
of
such
exquisite
politeness
and
deference
that
the
words
seemed
purged
of
all
their
rudeness
will
you
answer
me
so
sir
she
demanded
nevertheless
her
voice
quivering
my
love
interpolated
his
lordship
hurriedly
his
florid
face
aflush
we
are
vastly
indebted
to
caryll
as
you
shall
learn
it
was
he
who
saved
saved
the
drab
did
he
and
from
what
pray
madam
it
was
hortensia
who
spoke
she
had
risen
pale
with
anger
and
she
made
appeal
now
to
her
guardian
my
lord
i
not
remain
to
be
so
spoken
of
suffer
me
to
go
that
her
ladyship
should
so
speak
of
me
to
my
face
and
to
a
stranger
stranger
crowed
her
ladyship
lard
and
what
d
suppose
will
happen
are
you
so
nice
about
a
stranger
hearing
what
i
may
have
to
say
of
you
you
that
will
be
the
talk
of
the
whole
lewd
town
for
this
fine
escapade
and
what
the
town
say
of
you
my
love
his
lordship
sought
again
to
soothe
her
sylvia
let
me
implore
you
a
little
moderation
a
little
charity
hortensia
has
been
foolish
she
confesses
so
much
herself
yet
when
all
is
said
is
not
she
is
to
am
i
my
love
was
it
suggested
i
marvel
it
was
not
indeed
i
marvel
oh
hortensia
is
not
to
blame
the
sweet
pure
dove
what
is
she
then
to
be
pitied
said
his
lordship
stirred
to
sudden
anger
that
she
should
have
lent
an
ear
to
your
disreputable
my
son
my
son
cried
her
ladyship
her
voice
more
and
more
strident
her
face
flushing
till
the
rouge
upon
it
was
put
to
shame
revealed
in
all
its
unnatural
hideousness
and
is
he
not
your
son
my
lord
there
are
moments
he
answered
hardily
when
i
find
it
difficult
to
it
was
much
for
him
to
say
and
to
her
ladyship
of
all
people
it
was
pure
mutiny
she
gasped
for
air
pumped
her
brain
for
words
meantime
his
lordship
continued
with
an
eloquence
entirely
unusual
in
him
and
prompted
entirely
by
his
strong
feelings
in
the
matter
of
his
son
he
is
a
disgrace
to
his
name
he
always
has
been
when
a
boy
he
was
a
liar
and
a
thief
and
had
he
had
his
deserts
he
had
been
lodged
in
newgate
long
ago
or
worse
now
that
he
a
man
he
an
abandoned
profligate
a
brawler
a
drunkard
a
rakehell
so
much
i
have
long
known
him
for
but
he
has
shown
himself
for
something
even
worse
i
had
thought
that
my
ward
at
least
had
been
sacred
from
his
villainy
that
is
the
last
drop
i
not
condone
it
damn
me
i
ca
condone
it
i
disown
him
he
shall
not
set
foot
in
house
of
mine
again
let
him
keep
the
company
of
his
grace
of
wharton
and
his
other
abandoned
friends
of
the
hell
fire
club
he
keeps
not
mine
he
keeps
not
mine
i
say
her
ladyship
swallowed
hard
from
red
that
she
had
been
she
was
now
ashen
under
her
rouge
and
is
this
wanton
baggage
to
keep
mine
is
she
to
disgrace
a
household
that
has
grown
too
nice
to
contain
your
son
my
lord
oh
my
lord
give
me
leave
to
go
hortensia
entreated
ay
go
sneered
her
ladyship
go
you
had
best
go
back
to
him
what
for
did
ye
leave
him
did
ye
dream
there
could
be
aught
to
return
to
hortensia
turned
to
her
guardian
again
appealingly
but
her
ladyship
bore
down
upon
her
incensed
by
this
ignoring
she
caught
the
wrist
in
her
hand
answer
me
you
drab
what
for
did
you
return
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
now
that
y
are
soiled
goods
where
shall
we
find
a
husband
for
you
i
do
not
want
a
husband
madam
answered
hortensia
will
ye
lead
apes
in
hell
then
bah
is
not
what
ye
want
my
fine
madam
is
what
we
can
get
you
and
where
shall
we
find
you
a
husband
now
her
eye
fell
upon
caryll
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
a
look
of
profound
disgust
overplaying
the
usually
immobile
face
perhaps
the
gentleman
from
france
the
gentleman
who
saved
you
she
sneered
will
propose
to
take
the
with
all
my
heart
caryll
startled
them
and
himself
by
answering
then
perceiving
that
he
had
spoken
too
much
upon
impulse
given
utterance
to
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
i
but
mention
it
to
show
your
ladyship
how
mistaken
are
your
conclusions
he
added
the
countess
loosed
her
hold
of
hortensia
wrist
in
her
amazement
and
looked
the
gentleman
from
france
up
and
down
in
a
mighty
scornful
manner
codso
she
swore
i
may
take
it
then
that
your
saving
her
as
ye
call
it
was
no
indeed
it
was
and
a
most
fortunate
accident
for
your
for
my
son
as
how
it
saved
him
from
hanging
caryll
informed
her
and
gave
her
something
other
than
the
baiting
of
hortensia
to
occupy
her
mind
hang
she
gasped
are
you
speaking
of
lord
rotherby
ay
of
lord
rotherby
and
not
a
word
more
than
is
true
put
in
the
earl
do
you
know
but
you
do
not
the
extent
of
your
precious
villainy
at
maidstone
where
i
overtook
them
at
the
adam
and
eve
he
had
a
parson
and
he
was
luring
this
poor
child
into
a
her
ladyship
stared
she
echoed
marriage
la
and
again
she
vented
her
unpleasant
laugh
did
she
insist
on
that
the
prude
y
amaze
me
surely
my
love
you
do
not
apprehend
had
lord
rotherby
parson
not
been
detected
and
unmasked
by
caryll
here
would
you
ha
me
believe
she
did
not
know
the
fellow
was
no
parson
oh
cried
hortensia
your
ladyship
has
a
very
wicked
soul
may
god
forgive
you
and
who
is
to
forgive
you
snapped
the
countess
i
need
no
forgiveness
for
i
have
done
no
wrong
a
folly
i
confess
to
i
was
mad
to
have
heeded
such
a
her
ladyship
gathered
forces
for
a
fresh
assault
but
caryll
anticipated
it
it
was
no
doubt
a
great
impertinence
in
him
but
he
saw
hortensia
urgent
need
and
he
felt
moreover
that
not
even
lord
ostermore
would
resent
his
crossing
swords
a
moment
with
her
ladyship
you
would
do
well
to
remember
said
he
in
his
singularly
precise
voice
that
lord
rotherby
even
now
and
as
things
have
fallen
out
is
by
no
means
quit
of
all
she
looked
at
this
smooth
gentleman
and
his
words
burned
themselves
into
her
brain
she
quivered
with
mingling
fear
and
anger
wha
what
ye
mean
quoth
she
that
even
at
this
hour
if
the
matter
were
put
about
his
lordship
might
be
brought
to
account
for
it
and
it
might
fare
very
ill
with
him
the
law
of
england
deals
heavily
with
an
offense
such
as
lord
rotherby
and
the
attempt
at
a
of
which
there
is
no
lack
of
evidence
would
so
aggravate
the
crime
of
abduction
if
he
were
informed
against
that
it
might
go
very
hard
with
her
jaw
fell
she
caught
more
than
an
admonition
in
his
words
it
almost
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
threatening
who
who
is
to
inform
she
asked
her
tone
a
challenge
and
yet
the
odd
change
in
it
from
its
recent
aggressiveness
was
almost
ludicrous
ah
who
said
caryll
raising
his
eyes
and
fetching
a
sigh
it
would
appear
that
a
messenger
from
the
secretary
of
state
on
another
matter
was
at
the
adam
and
eve
at
the
time
with
two
of
his
catchpolls
and
he
was
a
witness
of
the
whole
affair
then
again
and
he
waved
a
hand
doorwards
servants
are
servants
i
make
no
doubt
they
are
listening
and
your
ladyship
voice
has
scarce
been
controlled
you
can
never
say
when
a
servant
may
cease
to
be
a
servant
and
become
an
active
damn
the
servants
she
swore
dismissing
them
from
consideration
who
is
this
messenger
of
the
secretary
who
is
he
he
was
named
green
is
all
i
and
where
may
he
be
found
i
can
not
she
turned
to
lord
ostermore
where
is
rotherby
she
inquired
she
was
a
thought
breathless
i
do
not
know
said
he
in
a
voice
that
signified
how
little
he
cared
he
must
be
found
this
fellow
silence
must
be
bought
i
not
have
my
son
disgraced
and
gaoled
perhaps
he
must
be
her
alarm
was
very
real
now
she
moved
towards
the
door
then
paused
and
turned
again
meantime
let
your
lordship
consider
what
dispositions
you
are
to
make
for
this
wretched
girl
who
is
the
cause
of
all
this
and
she
swept
out
slamming
the
door
violently
after
her
chapter
vii
father
and
son
caryll
stayed
to
dine
at
stretton
house
although
they
had
journeyed
but
from
croydon
that
morning
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
gone
first
to
his
lodging
to
have
made
fastidious
as
he
was
a
suitable
change
in
his
apparel
but
the
urgency
that
his
task
dictated
caused
him
to
waive
the
point
he
had
a
or
so
to
himself
after
the
stormy
scene
with
her
ladyship
in
which
he
had
played
again
though
in
a
lesser
degree
the
part
of
savior
to
mistress
winthrop
a
matter
for
which
the
lady
had
rewarded
him
ere
withdrawing
with
a
friendly
smile
which
caused
him
to
think
her
disposed
to
forgive
him
his
yesternight
folly
in
that
he
gave
himself
again
very
seriously
to
the
contemplation
of
his
position
he
had
no
illusions
on
the
score
of
lord
ostermore
and
he
rated
his
father
no
higher
than
he
deserved
but
he
was
just
and
shrewd
in
his
judgment
and
he
was
forced
to
confess
that
he
had
found
this
father
of
his
vastly
different
from
the
man
he
had
been
led
to
expect
he
had
looked
to
find
a
debauched
old
rake
a
vile
creature
steeped
in
vice
and
wickedness
instead
he
found
a
weak
commonplace
fellow
whose
worst
sin
seemed
to
be
the
selfishness
that
is
usually
inseparable
from
those
other
characteristics
if
ostermore
was
not
a
man
of
the
type
that
inspires
strong
affection
neither
was
he
of
the
type
that
provokes
strong
dislike
his
colorless
nature
left
one
indifferent
to
him
caryll
somewhat
to
his
dismay
found
himself
inclined
to
extend
the
man
some
sympathy
caught
himself
upon
the
verge
of
pitying
him
for
being
burdened
with
so
very
unfilial
a
son
and
so
very
cursed
a
wife
it
was
one
of
his
cherished
beliefs
that
the
evil
that
men
do
has
a
trick
of
finding
them
out
in
this
life
and
here
he
believed
as
husband
and
despised
father
the
earl
of
ostermore
was
being
made
to
expiate
that
sin
of
his
early
years
another
of
caryll
philosophies
was
that
when
all
is
said
man
is
little
of
a
free
agent
his
viciousness
or
sanctity
is
temperamental
and
not
the
man
but
his
nature
which
is
not
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
a
man
deeds
be
they
good
or
bad
in
the
abstract
such
beliefs
are
well
enough
they
are
excellent
standards
by
which
to
judge
where
other
sufferers
than
ourselves
are
concerned
but
when
we
ourselves
are
touched
they
are
discounted
by
the
measure
in
which
a
man
deeds
or
misdeeds
may
affect
us
and
although
to
an
extent
this
might
be
the
case
now
with
caryll
yet
in
spite
of
it
he
found
himself
excusing
his
father
on
the
score
of
the
weakness
and
stupidity
until
he
caught
himself
up
with
the
reflection
that
this
was
a
disloyalty
to
everard
to
his
training
and
to
his
mother
and
yet
he
reverted
in
such
a
man
as
ostermore
sheer
stupidity
a
lack
of
imagination
of
insight
into
things
as
they
really
are
a
lack
of
feeling
that
would
disable
him
from
appreciating
the
extent
of
any
wrong
he
did
seemed
to
caryll
to
be
extenuating
circumstances
he
conceived
that
he
was
amazingly
dispassionate
in
his
judgment
and
he
wondered
was
he
right
or
wrong
so
to
be
then
the
thought
of
his
task
arose
in
his
mind
and
it
bathed
him
in
a
sweat
of
horror
over
in
france
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
and
had
pledged
himself
to
do
this
thing
everard
the
relentless
unforgiving
fanatic
of
vengeance
had
as
we
have
seen
trained
him
to
believe
that
the
avenging
of
his
mother
wrongs
was
the
only
thing
that
could
justify
his
own
existence
besides
it
had
all
seemed
remote
then
and
easy
as
remote
things
are
apt
to
seem
but
now
now
that
he
had
met
in
the
flesh
this
man
who
was
his
father
his
hesitation
was
turned
to
very
horror
it
was
not
that
he
did
not
conceive
in
spite
of
his
odd
ideas
upon
temperament
and
its
responsibilities
that
his
mother
wrongs
cried
out
for
vengeance
and
that
the
avenging
of
them
would
be
a
righteous
fitting
deed
but
it
was
that
he
conceived
that
his
own
was
not
the
hand
to
do
the
work
of
the
executioner
upon
one
who
after
all
was
still
his
own
father
it
was
hideously
unnatural
he
sat
in
the
library
awaiting
his
lordship
and
the
announcement
of
dinner
there
was
a
book
before
him
but
his
eyes
were
upon
the
window
the
smooth
lawns
beyond
all
drenched
in
summer
sunshine
and
his
thoughts
were
introspective
he
looked
into
his
shuddering
soul
and
saw
that
he
could
not
that
he
would
not
do
the
thing
which
he
was
come
to
do
he
would
await
the
coming
of
everard
to
tell
him
so
there
would
be
a
storm
to
face
he
knew
but
sooner
that
than
carry
this
vile
thing
through
it
was
vile
most
damnably
vile
he
now
opined
the
decision
taken
he
rose
and
crossed
to
the
window
his
mind
had
been
in
travail
his
soul
had
known
the
pangs
of
labor
but
now
that
this
strong
resolve
had
been
brought
forth
an
ease
and
peace
were
his
that
seemed
to
prove
to
him
how
right
he
was
how
wrong
must
aught
else
have
been
lord
ostermore
came
in
he
announced
that
they
would
be
dining
alone
together
her
ladyship
he
explained
has
gone
forth
in
person
to
seek
lord
rotherby
she
believes
that
she
knows
where
to
find
him
in
some
disreputable
haunt
no
doubt
whither
her
ladyship
would
have
been
better
advised
to
have
sent
a
servant
but
women
are
wayward
cattle
wayward
headstrong
cattle
have
you
not
found
them
so
caryll
i
have
found
that
the
opinion
is
common
to
most
husbands
said
caryll
then
added
a
question
touching
mistress
winthrop
and
wondered
would
she
not
be
joining
them
at
table
the
poor
child
keeps
her
chamber
said
the
earl
she
is
overwrought
overwrought
i
am
afraid
her
ladyship
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
coughed
she
is
overwrought
he
repeated
in
conclusion
so
that
we
dine
and
alone
they
dined
ostermore
despite
the
havoc
suffered
by
his
fortunes
kept
an
excellent
table
and
a
clever
cook
and
caryll
was
glad
to
discover
in
his
sire
this
one
commendable
trait
the
conversation
was
desultory
throughout
the
repast
but
when
the
cloth
was
raised
and
the
table
cleared
of
all
but
the
dishes
of
fruit
and
the
decanters
of
oporto
canary
and
madeira
there
came
a
moment
of
expansion
caryll
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
fingering
the
stem
of
his
watching
the
play
of
sunlight
through
the
ruddy
amber
of
the
wine
and
considering
the
extraordinarily
odd
position
of
a
man
sitting
at
table
by
the
merest
chance
almost
with
a
father
who
was
not
aware
that
he
had
begotten
him
a
question
from
his
lordship
came
to
stir
him
partially
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
was
beginning
to
lapse
do
you
look
to
make
a
long
sojourn
in
england
caryll
it
will
depend
was
the
vague
and
answer
upon
the
success
of
the
matter
i
am
come
to
there
ensued
a
brief
pause
during
which
caryll
fell
again
into
his
abstraction
where
do
you
dwell
when
in
france
sir
inquired
my
lord
as
if
to
make
polite
conversation
caryll
lulled
by
his
musings
into
carelessness
answered
truthfully
at
maligny
in
the
next
moment
there
was
a
tinkle
of
breaking
glass
and
caryll
realized
his
indiscretion
and
turned
cold
lord
ostermore
who
had
been
in
the
act
of
raising
his
glass
fetched
it
down
again
so
suddenly
that
the
stem
broke
in
his
fingers
and
the
mahogany
was
flooded
with
the
liquor
a
servant
hastened
forward
and
set
a
fresh
glass
for
his
lordship
that
done
ostermore
signed
to
the
man
to
withdraw
the
fellow
went
closing
the
door
and
leaving
those
two
alone
the
pause
had
been
sufficient
to
enable
caryll
to
recover
and
for
all
that
his
pulses
throbbed
more
quickly
than
their
habit
outwardly
he
maintained
his
lazily
indifferent
pose
as
if
entirely
unconscious
that
what
he
had
said
had
occasioned
his
father
the
least
disturbance
you
you
dwelt
at
maligny
said
his
lordship
the
usual
high
color
all
vanished
from
his
face
and
again
you
dwelt
at
maligny
and
and
your
name
is
caryll
looked
up
quickly
as
if
suddenly
aware
that
his
lordship
was
expressing
surprise
why
yes
said
he
what
is
there
odd
in
that
how
does
it
happen
that
you
come
to
live
there
are
you
at
all
connected
with
the
family
of
maligny
on
your
mother
side
perhaps
caryll
took
up
his
i
take
it
said
he
easily
that
there
was
some
such
family
at
some
time
but
it
is
clear
it
must
have
fallen
upon
evil
he
sipped
at
his
wine
there
are
none
left
now
he
explained
as
he
set
down
his
glass
the
last
of
them
died
i
believe
in
his
eyes
turned
full
upon
the
earl
but
their
glance
seemed
entirely
idle
it
was
in
consequence
of
that
that
my
father
was
enabled
to
purchase
the
caryll
accounted
it
no
lie
that
he
suppressed
the
fact
that
the
father
to
whom
he
referred
was
but
his
father
by
adoption
relief
spread
instantly
upon
lord
ostermore
countenance
clearly
he
saw
here
was
pure
coincidence
and
nothing
more
indeed
what
else
should
there
have
been
what
was
it
that
he
had
feared
he
did
not
know
still
he
accounted
it
an
odd
matter
and
said
so
what
is
odd
inquired
caryll
does
it
happen
that
your
lordship
was
acquainted
at
any
time
with
that
vanished
family
i
was
sir
slightly
acquainted
at
one
time
with
one
or
two
of
its
members
is
that
that
is
odd
you
see
sir
my
name
too
happens
to
be
true
yet
i
see
nothing
so
oddly
coincident
in
the
matter
particularly
if
your
acquaintance
with
these
malignys
was
but
indeed
you
are
right
you
are
right
there
is
no
such
great
coincidence
when
all
is
said
the
name
reminded
me
of
a
a
folly
of
my
youth
was
that
that
made
a
folly
quoth
caryll
his
eyebrows
raised
ay
a
folly
a
folly
that
went
near
undoing
me
for
had
it
come
to
my
father
ears
he
had
broke
me
without
mercy
he
was
a
hard
man
my
father
a
puritan
in
his
a
greater
than
your
lordship
inquired
caryll
blandly
masking
the
rage
that
seethed
in
him
his
lordship
laughed
ye
a
wag
caryll
a
damned
wag
then
reverting
to
the
matter
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
is
a
fact
though
honor
my
father
would
ha
broke
me
luckily
she
who
died
asked
caryll
with
a
show
of
interest
the
girl
did
i
not
tell
you
there
was
a
girl
was
she
was
the
folly
antoinette
de
maligny
but
she
died
most
opportunely
egad
was
a
very
damned
mercy
that
she
did
it
cut
the
the
what
d
call
it
knot
the
gordian
knot
suggested
caryll
ay
the
gordian
knot
had
she
lived
and
had
my
father
smoked
the
affair
gad
he
would
ha
broke
me
he
would
so
he
repeated
and
emptied
his
glass
caryll
white
to
the
lips
sat
very
still
a
moment
then
he
did
a
curious
thing
did
it
with
a
curious
suddenness
he
took
a
knife
from
the
table
and
hacked
off
the
lowest
button
from
his
coat
this
he
pushed
across
the
board
to
his
father
to
turn
to
other
matters
said
he
there
is
the
letter
you
were
expecting
from
eh
what
lord
ostermore
took
up
the
button
it
was
of
silk
interwoven
with
gold
thread
he
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
looking
at
it
with
a
heavy
eye
and
then
at
his
guest
eh
letter
he
muttered
puzzled
if
your
lordship
will
cut
that
open
you
will
see
what
his
majesty
has
to
he
mentioned
the
king
in
a
voice
charged
with
suggestion
so
that
no
doubt
could
linger
on
the
score
of
the
king
he
meant
gad
cried
his
lordship
gad
was
thus
ye
bubbled
green
shrewd
on
my
soul
and
you
are
the
messenger
then
i
am
the
messenger
answered
caryll
coldly
and
why
did
you
not
say
so
before
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
caryll
hesitated
then
because
i
did
not
judge
that
the
time
was
come
said
he
chapter
viii
temptation
his
lordship
ripped
away
the
silk
covering
of
the
button
with
a
penknife
and
disembowelled
it
of
a
small
packet
which
consisted
of
a
sheet
of
fine
and
very
and
paper
this
he
spread
cast
an
eye
over
and
then
looked
up
at
his
companion
who
was
watching
him
with
simulated
indolence
his
lordship
had
paled
a
little
and
there
was
about
the
lines
of
his
mouth
a
look
of
preternatural
gravity
he
looked
furtively
towards
the
door
his
heavy
eyebrows
lowering
i
think
he
said
that
we
shall
be
more
snug
in
the
library
will
you
bear
me
company
caryll
caryll
rose
instantly
the
earl
folded
the
letter
and
turned
to
go
his
companion
paused
to
pick
up
the
fragments
of
the
button
and
slip
them
into
his
pocket
he
performed
the
office
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
was
half
pity
half
contempt
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
there
would
be
the
least
need
to
betray
lord
ostermore
once
his
lordship
was
wedded
to
the
stuart
faction
he
would
not
fail
to
betray
himself
through
some
act
of
thoughtless
stupidity
such
as
this
in
the
library
the
door
and
that
of
the
beyond
it
carefully
closed
his
lordship
unlocked
a
secretaire
of
walnut
very
handsomely
inlaid
and
drawing
up
a
chair
he
sat
down
to
the
perusal
of
the
king
letter
when
he
had
read
it
through
he
remained
lost
in
thought
a
while
at
length
he
looked
up
and
across
towards
caryll
who
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
you
are
no
doubt
a
confidential
agent
sir
said
he
and
you
will
be
fully
aware
of
the
contents
of
this
letter
that
you
have
brought
fully
my
lord
answered
caryll
and
i
venture
to
hope
that
his
majesty
promises
will
overcome
any
hesitation
that
you
may
his
majesty
promises
said
my
lord
thoughtfully
his
majesty
may
never
have
a
chance
of
fulfilling
very
true
sir
but
who
gambles
must
set
a
stake
upon
the
board
your
lordship
has
been
something
of
a
gamester
already
and
or
so
i
gather
with
little
profit
here
is
a
chance
to
play
another
game
that
may
mend
the
evil
fortunes
of
the
the
earl
scanned
him
in
surprise
you
are
excellent
well
informed
said
he
between
surprise
and
irony
my
trade
demands
it
knowledge
is
my
his
lordship
nodded
slowly
and
fell
very
thoughtful
the
letter
before
him
his
eyes
wandering
ever
and
anon
to
con
again
some
portion
of
it
it
is
a
game
in
which
i
stake
my
head
he
muttered
presently
has
your
lordship
anything
else
to
stake
inquired
caryll
the
earl
looked
at
him
again
with
a
gloomy
eye
and
sighed
but
said
nothing
caryll
resumed
it
is
for
your
lordship
to
declare
he
said
quite
coolly
whether
his
majesty
has
covered
your
stake
if
you
think
not
it
is
even
possible
that
he
may
be
induced
to
improve
his
offer
though
if
you
think
not
for
my
own
part
i
consider
that
you
set
too
high
a
value
on
that
same
head
of
touched
in
his
vanity
ostermore
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sudden
frown
you
take
a
bold
tone
sir
said
he
a
very
bold
tone
boldness
is
the
attribute
next
to
knowledge
most
essential
to
my
calling
caryll
reminded
him
his
lordship
eye
fell
before
the
other
cold
glance
and
again
he
lapsed
into
thoughtfulness
his
cheek
now
upon
his
hand
suddenly
he
looked
up
again
tell
me
said
he
who
else
is
in
this
thing
men
say
that
atterbury
is
not
above
suspicion
is
it
caryll
bent
forward
to
tap
the
king
letter
with
a
rigid
forefinger
when
your
lordship
tells
me
that
you
are
ready
to
concert
upon
embarking
your
fortunes
in
this
bottom
you
shall
find
me
disposed
perhaps
to
answer
questions
concerning
others
meanwhile
our
concern
is
with
dons
and
the
devil
swore
his
lordship
angrily
is
this
a
way
to
speak
to
me
he
scowled
at
the
agent
tell
me
my
fine
fellow
what
would
happen
if
i
were
to
lay
this
letter
you
have
brought
me
before
the
nearest
justice
i
can
not
say
for
sure
answered
caryll
quietly
but
it
is
very
probable
it
would
help
your
lordship
to
the
gallows
for
if
you
will
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
reading
it
again
and
more
carefully
you
will
see
that
it
makes
acknowledgment
of
the
offer
of
services
you
wrote
his
majesty
a
month
or
so
his
lordship
eyes
dropped
to
the
letter
again
he
caught
his
breath
in
sudden
fear
were
i
your
lordship
i
should
leave
the
nearest
justice
to
enjoy
his
dinner
in
peace
said
caryll
smiling
his
lordship
laughed
in
a
sickly
manner
he
felt
foolish
a
rare
condition
in
him
as
in
most
fools
well
well
said
he
gruffly
the
matter
needs
reflection
it
needs
behind
them
the
door
opened
noiselessly
and
her
ladyship
appeared
in
cloak
and
wimple
she
paused
there
unperceived
by
either
arrested
by
the
words
she
had
caught
and
waiting
in
the
hope
of
hearing
more
i
must
sleep
o
at
least
his
lordship
was
continuing
is
too
grave
a
matter
to
be
determined
thus
in
a
faint
sound
caught
the
keen
ears
of
caryll
he
turned
with
a
leisureliness
that
bore
witness
to
his
miraculous
perceiving
the
countess
he
bowed
and
casually
put
his
lordship
on
his
guard
ah
said
he
here
is
her
ladyship
lord
ostermore
gasped
audibly
and
swung
round
in
an
alarm
than
which
nothing
could
have
betrayed
him
more
effectively
my
my
love
he
cried
stammering
and
by
his
wild
haste
to
conceal
the
letter
that
he
held
drew
her
attention
to
it
caryll
stepped
between
them
his
back
to
his
lordship
that
he
might
act
as
a
screen
under
cover
of
which
to
dispose
safely
of
that
dangerous
document
but
he
was
too
late
her
ladyship
quick
eyes
had
flashed
to
it
and
if
the
distance
precluded
the
possibility
of
her
discovering
anything
that
might
be
written
upon
it
she
nevertheless
could
see
the
curious
nature
of
the
paper
which
was
of
the
flimsiest
tissue
of
a
sort
extremely
uncommon
what
ye
hide
said
she
as
she
came
forward
why
we
are
very
close
surely
what
mischief
ye
hatch
my
lord
mis
mischief
my
love
he
smiled
propitiatingly
hating
her
more
than
ever
in
that
moment
he
had
stuffed
the
letter
into
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
but
that
she
had
another
matter
to
concern
her
at
the
moment
she
would
not
have
allowed
the
question
she
had
asked
to
be
so
put
aside
but
this
other
matter
upon
her
mind
touched
her
very
closely
devil
take
it
whatever
it
may
be
rotherby
is
rotherby
his
demeanor
changed
from
conciliating
it
was
of
a
sudden
transformed
to
indignant
what
makes
he
here
he
demanded
did
i
not
forbid
him
my
house
i
brought
him
she
answered
pregnantly
but
for
once
he
was
not
to
be
put
down
then
you
may
take
him
hence
again
said
he
i
not
have
him
under
my
roof
under
the
same
roof
with
that
poor
child
he
used
so
infamously
i
not
suffer
it
the
gorgon
can
not
have
looked
more
coldly
wicked
than
her
ladyship
just
then
have
a
care
my
lord
she
muttered
threateningly
oh
have
a
care
i
do
beseech
you
i
am
not
so
to
be
crossed
nor
am
i
he
rejoined
and
then
before
more
could
be
said
caryll
stepped
forward
to
remind
them
of
his
presence
which
they
seemed
to
stand
in
danger
of
forgetting
i
fear
that
i
intrude
my
lord
said
he
and
bowed
in
i
shall
wait
upon
your
lordship
later
your
most
devoted
your
very
humble
and
he
bowed
himself
out
in
the
he
came
upon
lord
rotherby
striding
to
and
fro
his
brow
all
furrowed
with
care
at
sight
of
caryll
the
scowl
grew
blacker
oons
and
the
devil
he
cried
what
make
you
here
that
said
caryll
pleasantly
is
the
very
question
your
father
is
asking
her
ladyship
concerning
yourself
your
servant
and
airy
graceful
smiling
that
damnable
close
smile
of
his
he
was
gone
leaving
rotherby
very
hot
and
angry
outside
caryll
hailed
a
chair
and
had
himself
carried
to
his
lodging
in
old
palace
yard
where
leduc
awaited
him
as
his
bearers
swung
briskly
along
caryll
sat
back
and
gave
himself
up
to
thought
lord
ostermore
interested
him
vastly
for
a
moment
that
day
the
earl
had
aroused
his
anger
as
you
may
have
judged
from
the
sudden
resolve
upon
which
he
had
acted
when
he
delivered
him
that
letter
thus
embarking
at
the
eleventh
hour
upon
a
task
which
he
had
already
determined
to
abandon
he
knew
not
now
whether
to
rejoice
or
deplore
that
he
had
acted
upon
that
angry
impulse
he
knew
not
indeed
whether
to
pity
or
despise
this
man
who
was
swayed
by
no
such
high
motives
as
must
have
affected
most
of
those
who
were
faithful
to
the
exiled
james
those
motives
motives
of
chivalry
and
romanticism
in
most
cases
lord
ostermore
would
have
despised
if
he
could
have
understood
them
for
he
was
a
man
of
the
type
that
despises
all
things
that
are
not
essentially
practical
whose
results
are
not
immediately
obvious
being
all
but
ruined
by
his
association
with
the
south
sea
company
he
was
willing
for
the
sake
of
profit
to
turn
traitor
to
the
king
de
facto
even
as
thirty
years
ago
actuated
by
similar
motives
he
had
turned
traitor
to
the
king
de
jure
what
was
one
to
make
of
such
a
man
wondered
caryll
if
he
were
equipped
with
wit
enough
to
apprehend
the
baseness
of
his
conduct
he
would
be
easily
understood
and
it
would
be
easy
to
despise
him
but
caryll
perceived
that
he
was
dealing
with
one
who
never
probed
into
the
deeps
of
anything
himself
and
his
own
conduct
least
of
all
and
that
a
deplorable
lack
of
perception
of
understanding
almost
deprived
his
lordship
of
the
power
to
feel
as
most
men
feel
to
judge
as
most
men
judge
and
hence
was
it
that
caryll
thought
him
a
subject
for
pity
rather
than
contempt
even
in
that
other
matter
that
so
closely
touched
caryll
the
latter
was
sure
that
the
same
pitiful
shortcomings
might
be
urged
in
the
man
excuse
meanwhile
behind
him
at
stretton
house
caryll
had
left
a
scene
of
strife
between
lady
ostermore
and
her
son
on
one
side
and
lord
ostermore
on
the
other
weak
and
vacillating
as
he
was
in
most
things
it
seemed
that
the
earl
could
be
strong
in
his
dislike
of
his
son
and
firm
in
his
determination
not
to
condone
the
infamy
of
his
behavior
toward
hortensia
winthrop
the
fault
is
yours
rotherby
sought
to
excuse
himself
again
employing
the
old
argument
and
in
an
angry
contemptuous
tone
that
was
entirely
unfilial
i
ha
married
the
girl
in
earnest
but
for
your
threats
to
disinherit
you
fool
his
father
stormed
at
him
did
you
suppose
that
if
i
should
disinherit
you
for
marrying
her
i
should
be
likely
to
do
less
for
your
luring
her
into
a
mock
marriage
i
done
with
you
go
your
ways
for
a
damned
profligate
a
scandal
to
the
very
name
of
gentleman
i
done
with
you
and
to
that
the
earl
adhered
in
spite
of
all
that
rotherby
and
his
mother
could
urge
he
stamped
out
of
the
library
with
a
final
command
to
his
son
to
quit
his
house
and
never
disgrace
it
again
by
his
presence
rotherby
looked
ruefully
at
his
mother
he
means
it
said
he
he
never
loved
me
he
was
never
a
father
to
were
you
ever
greatly
a
son
to
him
asked
her
ladyship
as
much
as
he
would
ha
me
be
he
answered
his
black
face
very
sullen
oh
i
am
damnably
used
by
he
paced
the
chamber
storming
all
this
garboil
about
nothing
he
complained
was
he
never
young
himself
and
when
all
is
said
there
no
harm
done
the
girl
been
fetched
home
pshaw
ye
a
fool
rotherby
a
fool
and
there
an
end
o
said
his
mother
i
sometimes
wonder
which
is
the
greater
fool
you
or
your
father
and
yet
he
can
marvel
that
you
are
his
son
what
do
ye
think
would
have
happened
if
you
had
had
your
way
with
that
miss
it
had
been
matter
enough
to
hang
pooh
said
the
viscount
dropping
into
a
chair
and
staring
sullenly
at
the
carpet
then
sullenly
he
added
his
lordship
would
have
been
glad
o
so
some
one
would
have
been
pleased
as
it
is
as
it
is
ye
better
find
the
man
green
who
was
at
maidstone
and
stop
his
mouth
with
guineas
he
is
aware
of
what
bah
green
was
there
on
other
and
he
told
her
of
the
suspicions
the
messenger
entertained
against
caryll
it
set
her
ladyship
thinking
why
she
said
presently
be
that
be
what
asked
rotherby
looking
up
why
this
fellow
caryll
must
ha
bubbled
the
messenger
in
spite
of
the
search
he
may
have
made
i
found
the
popinjay
here
with
your
father
the
pair
as
thick
as
thieves
and
your
father
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
as
fine
as
a
cobweb
i
be
sworn
he
a
damned
rotherby
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
he
remembered
suddenly
all
that
he
had
overheard
at
maidstone
oho
he
crowed
what
cause
have
ye
to
think
that
cause
why
what
i
have
seen
besides
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
my
every
instinct
tells
me
is
if
you
should
prove
right
oh
if
you
should
prove
right
death
find
a
way
to
settle
the
score
of
that
pert
fellow
from
france
and
to
dictate
terms
to
his
lordship
at
the
same
her
ladyship
stared
at
him
ye
an
unnatural
hound
rotherby
would
ye
betray
your
own
father
betray
him
no
but
i
set
a
term
to
his
plotting
egad
has
he
not
lost
enough
in
the
south
sea
bubble
without
sinking
the
little
that
is
left
in
some
jacobite
plot
how
shall
it
matter
to
you
since
he
sworn
to
disinherit
you
how
madam
rotherby
laughed
cunningly
i
prevent
the
one
and
the
other
and
pay
off
caryll
at
the
same
time
three
birds
with
one
stone
let
me
perish
he
reached
for
his
hat
i
must
find
this
fellow
what
will
you
do
she
asked
a
slight
anxiety
trembling
in
her
voice
stir
up
his
suspicions
of
caryll
he
be
ready
enough
to
act
after
his
discomfiture
at
maidstone
i
warrant
he
smarting
under
it
if
once
we
can
find
cause
to
lay
caryll
by
the
heels
the
fear
of
the
consequences
should
bring
his
lordship
to
his
senses
be
my
turn
but
you
do
nothing
that
that
will
hurt
your
father
she
enjoined
him
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
trust
me
he
laughed
and
added
cynically
it
would
hardly
sort
with
my
interests
to
involve
him
it
will
serve
me
best
to
frighten
him
into
reason
and
a
sense
of
his
paternal
chapter
ix
the
champion
caryll
was
well
and
handsomely
housed
as
became
the
man
of
fashion
in
the
lodging
he
had
taken
in
old
palace
yard
knowing
him
from
abroad
it
was
not
impossible
that
the
government
fearful
of
sedition
since
the
disturbance
caused
by
the
south
sea
distress
and
aware
of
an
undercurrent
of
jacobitism
might
for
a
time
at
least
keep
an
eye
upon
him
it
behooved
him
therefore
to
appear
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
lounger
a
gentleman
of
pleasure
who
had
come
to
london
in
quest
of
diversion
to
support
this
appearance
caryll
had
sought
out
some
friends
of
his
in
town
there
were
stapleton
and
collis
who
had
been
at
oxford
with
him
and
with
whom
he
had
ever
since
maintained
a
correspondence
and
a
friendship
he
sought
them
out
on
the
very
evening
of
his
arrival
after
his
interview
with
lord
ostermore
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
handsomely
welcomed
by
them
and
was
plunged
under
their
guidance
into
the
gaieties
that
the
town
afforded
liberally
for
people
of
quality
caryll
was
as
i
hope
you
have
gathered
an
agreeable
fellow
very
free
moreover
with
the
contents
of
his
purse
and
so
you
may
conceive
that
the
town
showed
him
a
very
friendly
cordial
countenance
he
fell
into
the
habits
of
the
men
whose
company
he
frequented
his
days
were
as
idle
as
theirs
and
spent
at
the
parade
the
ring
the
play
the
coffeehouse
and
the
ordinary
but
under
the
gay
exterior
he
affected
he
carried
a
spirit
of
most
vile
unrest
the
anger
which
had
prompted
his
impulse
to
execute
after
all
the
business
on
which
he
was
come
and
to
deliver
his
father
the
letter
that
was
to
work
his
ruin
was
all
spent
he
had
cooled
and
cool
it
was
idle
for
him
to
tell
himself
that
lord
ostermore
by
his
heartless
allusion
to
the
crime
of
his
early
years
had
proved
himself
worthy
of
nothing
but
the
pit
caryll
had
been
sent
to
dig
for
him
there
were
moments
when
he
sought
to
compel
himself
so
to
think
to
steel
himself
against
all
other
considerations
but
it
was
idle
the
reflection
that
the
task
before
him
was
unnatural
came
ever
to
revolt
him
to
gain
ease
the
most
that
he
could
do
and
he
had
the
faculty
of
it
developed
in
a
preternatural
degree
was
to
put
the
business
from
him
for
the
time
endeavor
to
forget
it
and
he
had
another
matter
to
consider
and
to
plague
him
the
matter
of
hortensia
winthrop
he
thought
of
her
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
his
peace
of
mind
for
all
that
he
pretended
to
a
gladness
that
things
were
as
they
were
each
morning
that
he
lounged
at
the
parade
in
james
park
each
evening
that
he
visited
the
ring
it
was
in
the
hope
of
catching
some
glimpse
of
her
among
the
fashionable
women
that
went
abroad
to
see
and
to
be
seen
and
on
the
third
morning
after
his
arrival
the
thing
he
hoped
for
came
to
pass
it
had
happened
that
my
lady
had
ordered
her
carriage
that
morning
dressed
herself
with
the
habitual
splendor
which
but
set
off
the
shortcomings
of
her
lean
and
angular
person
egregiously
coiffed
pulvilled
and
topknotted
and
she
had
sent
a
message
amounting
to
a
command
to
mistress
winthrop
that
she
should
drive
in
the
park
with
her
poor
hortensia
whose
one
desire
was
to
hide
her
face
from
the
uncharitable
sight
just
then
fearing
indeed
that
rumor
unscrupulous
tongue
would
be
as
busy
about
her
reputation
as
her
ladyship
had
represented
attempted
to
assert
herself
by
refusing
to
obey
the
command
it
was
in
vain
her
ladyship
dispensed
with
ambassadors
and
went
in
person
to
convey
her
orders
to
her
husband
ward
and
to
enforce
them
what
this
i
am
told
quoth
she
as
she
sailed
into
hortensia
room
do
my
wishes
count
for
nothing
that
you
send
me
pert
answers
by
my
woman
hortensia
rose
she
had
been
sitting
by
the
window
a
book
in
her
lap
not
so
indeed
madam
not
pert
i
trust
i
am
none
so
well
and
i
fear
the
is
little
wonder
laughed
her
ladyship
and
i
glad
o
for
it
shows
ye
have
a
conscience
somewhere
but
is
no
matter
for
that
i
am
tender
for
your
reputation
mistress
and
i
not
have
you
shunning
daylight
like
the
guilty
thing
ye
know
yourself
to
is
false
madam
said
hortensia
with
indignation
your
ladyship
knows
it
to
be
harkee
ninny
if
you
have
the
town
believe
it
false
you
show
yourself
show
that
ye
have
no
cause
for
shame
no
cause
to
hide
you
from
the
eyes
of
honest
folk
come
girl
bid
your
woman
get
your
hood
and
tippet
the
carriage
stays
for
to
hortensia
her
ladyship
seemed
after
all
a
good
argument
did
she
hide
what
must
the
town
think
but
that
it
confirmed
the
talk
that
she
made
no
doubt
was
going
round
already
better
to
go
forth
and
brave
it
and
surely
it
should
disarm
the
backbiters
if
she
showed
herself
in
the
park
with
lord
rotherby
own
mother
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
this
seeming
tenderness
for
her
reputation
might
be
but
wanton
cruelty
on
her
ladyship
part
a
gratifying
of
her
spleen
against
the
girl
by
setting
her
in
the
pillory
of
public
sight
to
the
end
that
she
should
experience
the
insult
of
supercilious
glances
and
lips
that
smile
with
an
ostentation
of
furtiveness
a
desire
to
put
down
her
pride
and
break
the
spirit
which
my
lady
accounted
insolent
and
stubborn
suspecting
naught
of
this
she
consented
and
drove
out
with
her
ladyship
as
she
was
desired
to
do
but
understanding
of
her
cruel
motives
and
repentance
of
her
own
acquiescence
were
not
long
in
following
soon
very
soon
she
realized
that
anything
would
have
been
better
than
the
ordeal
she
was
forced
to
undergo
it
was
a
warm
sunny
morning
and
the
park
was
crowded
with
fashionable
loungers
lady
ostermore
left
her
carriage
at
the
gates
and
entered
the
enclosure
on
foot
accompanied
by
hortensia
and
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
footman
her
arrival
proved
something
of
a
sensation
hats
were
swept
off
to
her
ladyship
sly
glances
flashed
at
her
companion
who
went
pale
but
apparently
serene
eyes
looking
straight
before
her
and
there
was
an
obvious
concealing
of
smiles
at
first
which
later
grew
to
be
all
unconcealed
and
later
still
became
supplemented
by
remarks
that
all
might
hear
remarks
which
did
not
escape
as
they
were
meant
not
to
escape
her
ladyship
and
mistress
winthrop
madam
murmured
the
girl
in
her
agony
of
shame
we
were
not
to
come
will
not
your
ladyship
turn
back
her
ladyship
displayed
a
vinegary
smile
and
looked
at
her
companion
over
the
top
of
her
slowly
moving
fan
why
not
pleasant
here
quoth
she
be
more
agreeable
under
the
trees
yonder
the
sun
will
not
reach
you
there
is
not
the
sun
i
mind
madam
said
hortensia
but
received
no
answer
perforce
she
must
pace
on
beside
her
ladyship
lord
rotherby
came
by
arm
in
arm
with
his
friend
the
duke
of
wharton
it
was
a
friendship
lord
rotherby
was
but
one
of
the
many
of
his
type
who
furnished
a
court
a
valetaille
to
the
gay
dissolute
handsome
witty
duke
who
might
have
been
great
had
he
not
preferred
his
vices
to
his
worthier
parts
as
they
went
by
lord
rotherby
bared
his
head
and
bowed
as
did
his
companion
her
ladyship
smiled
upon
him
but
hortensia
eyes
looked
rigidly
ahead
her
face
a
stone
she
heard
his
grace
insolent
laugh
as
they
passed
on
she
heard
his
voice
nowise
subdued
for
he
was
a
man
who
loved
to
let
the
world
hear
what
he
might
have
to
say
gad
rotherby
the
wind
has
changed
your
dulcinea
flies
with
you
wednesday
and
has
a
glance
for
you
o
saturday
i
faith
ye
deserve
no
better
art
a
clumsy
gallant
to
have
been
overtaken
and
the
maid
in
the
right
o
to
resent
your
rotherby
reply
was
lost
in
a
splutter
of
laughter
from
a
group
of
sycophants
who
had
overheard
his
grace
criticism
and
were
but
too
ready
to
laugh
at
aught
his
grace
might
deign
to
utter
her
cheeks
burned
it
was
by
an
effort
that
she
suppressed
the
tears
that
anger
was
forcing
to
her
eyes
the
duke
was
plain
had
set
the
fashion
emulators
were
not
wanting
stray
words
she
caught
by
instinct
was
she
conscious
of
the
oglings
the
fluttering
of
fans
from
the
women
the
flashing
of
from
the
men
and
everywhere
was
there
a
suppressed
laugh
a
stifled
exclamation
of
surprise
at
her
appearance
in
public
yet
not
so
stifled
but
that
it
reached
her
as
it
was
intended
that
it
should
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
elm
around
which
there
was
a
seat
a
little
group
had
gathered
of
which
the
centre
was
the
sometime
toast
of
the
town
and
queen
of
many
wells
the
lady
mary
deller
still
beautiful
and
still
unwed
as
is
so
often
the
way
of
reigning
toasts
but
already
past
her
pristine
freshness
already
leaning
upon
the
support
of
art
to
maintain
the
endowments
she
had
had
from
nature
she
was
accounted
witty
by
the
witless
and
by
some
others
of
the
group
that
paid
its
court
to
her
and
her
companions
two
giggling
cousins
in
their
first
season
were
caryll
and
his
friends
sir
harry
collis
and
edward
stapleton
the
former
of
whom
he
was
the
had
just
presented
him
caryll
was
dressed
with
even
more
than
his
ordinary
magnificence
he
was
in
cloth
his
coat
very
richly
laced
with
gold
his
waistcoat
of
white
brocade
with
jeweled
buttons
the
outlined
in
finest
gold
thread
descended
midway
to
his
knees
whilst
the
ruffles
at
his
wrists
and
the
steinkirk
at
his
throat
were
of
the
finest
point
he
cut
a
figure
of
supremest
elegance
as
he
stood
there
his
chestnut
head
slightly
bowed
in
deference
as
my
lady
mary
spoke
his
hat
tucked
under
his
arm
his
right
hand
outstretched
beside
him
to
rest
upon
the
gold
head
of
his
cane
to
the
general
he
was
a
stranger
still
in
town
and
of
the
sort
that
draws
the
eye
and
provokes
inquiry
lady
mary
the
only
goal
of
whose
shallow
existence
was
the
attention
of
the
sterner
sex
who
loved
to
break
hearts
as
a
child
breaks
toys
for
the
fun
of
seeing
how
they
look
when
broken
and
who
because
of
that
had
succeeded
in
breaking
far
fewer
than
she
fondly
imagined
looked
up
into
his
face
with
the
most
perditiously
alluring
eyes
in
england
so
craske
the
poet
who
stood
at
her
elbow
now
had
described
them
in
the
dedicatory
sonnet
of
his
last
book
of
poems
wherefore
in
parenthesis
be
it
observed
she
had
rewarded
him
with
twenty
guineas
as
he
had
calculated
that
she
would
there
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
group
craske
had
caught
sight
of
lady
ostermore
and
mistress
winthrop
and
he
fell
to
giggling
a
flimsy
handkerchief
to
his
painted
lips
oh
he
bleated
let
me
die
the
audaciousness
of
the
creature
and
behold
me
the
port
and
glance
of
her
cold
as
a
vestal
let
me
perish
lady
mary
turned
with
the
others
to
look
in
the
direction
he
was
pointing
pointing
openly
with
no
thought
of
dissembling
caryll
eyes
fell
upon
mistress
winthrop
and
his
glance
was
oddly
perceptive
he
observed
those
matters
of
which
craske
had
seemed
to
make
sardonic
comment
the
erect
stiffness
of
her
carriage
the
eyes
that
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
and
the
pallor
of
her
face
he
observed
too
the
complacent
air
with
which
her
ladyship
advanced
beside
her
husband
ward
her
fan
moving
languidly
her
head
nodding
to
her
acquaintance
as
in
supreme
unconcern
of
the
stir
her
coming
had
effected
caryll
had
been
dull
indeed
knowing
what
he
knew
had
he
not
understood
to
the
full
the
humiliation
to
which
mistress
hortensia
was
being
of
purpose
set
submitted
and
just
then
rotherby
who
had
turned
with
wharton
and
another
now
came
by
them
again
this
time
he
halted
and
his
companions
with
him
for
just
a
moment
to
address
his
mother
she
turned
there
was
an
exchange
of
greetings
in
which
mistress
hortensia
standing
rigid
as
stone
took
no
part
a
silence
fell
about
went
up
all
eyes
were
focussed
upon
the
group
then
rotherby
and
his
friends
resumed
their
way
the
dog
said
caryll
between
his
teeth
but
went
unheard
by
any
for
in
that
moment
dorothy
deller
the
younger
of
the
lady
cousins
gave
expression
to
the
generous
and
as
yet
unsullied
little
heart
that
was
her
own
oh
is
shameful
she
cried
will
you
not
go
speak
with
her
molly
the
lady
mary
stiffened
she
looked
at
the
company
about
her
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
beg
that
ye
not
heed
the
child
said
she
is
not
that
she
is
without
morals
but
without
knowledge
an
innocent
little
fool
no
is
bad
enough
i
vow
laughed
an
old
beau
who
sought
fame
as
a
man
of
a
cynical
turn
of
humor
but
fortunately
rare
said
caryll
dryly
like
charity
almost
unknown
in
this
his
tone
was
not
quite
nice
although
perhaps
the
lady
mary
was
the
only
one
to
perceive
the
note
of
challenge
in
it
but
craske
the
poet
diverted
attention
to
himself
by
a
prolonged
malicious
chuckle
rotherby
was
just
moving
away
from
his
mother
at
that
moment
they
never
a
word
for
each
other
he
cried
oh
not
so
much
as
the
mercy
of
a
glance
will
the
lady
afford
and
he
burst
into
the
ballad
of
king
francis
souvent
femme
varie
bien
fol
est
qui
fie
and
laughed
his
prodigious
delight
at
the
aptness
of
his
quotation
caryll
put
up
his
and
directed
through
that
powerful
weapon
of
offence
an
eye
of
supreme
displeasure
upon
the
singer
he
could
not
contain
his
rage
yet
from
his
languid
tone
none
would
have
suspected
it
sir
said
he
ye
a
singular
unpleasant
craske
thrown
out
of
countenance
by
so
much
directness
could
only
stare
the
same
did
the
others
though
some
few
tittered
for
craske
when
all
was
said
was
held
in
no
great
esteem
by
the
discriminant
caryll
lowered
his
glass
i
heard
it
said
by
the
uncharitable
that
ye
were
a
lackey
before
ye
became
a
plagiarist
is
a
rumor
i
shall
contradict
in
future
is
plainly
a
lie
for
your
voice
betrays
you
to
have
been
a
sir
sir
spluttered
the
poetaster
crimson
with
anger
and
mortification
is
this
is
this
seemly
between
gentlemen
between
gentlemen
it
would
not
be
seemly
caryll
agreed
craske
quivering
yet
controlling
himself
bowed
stiffly
i
have
too
much
respect
for
myself
he
gasped
ye
be
singular
in
that
no
doubt
said
caryll
and
turned
his
shoulder
upon
him
again
craske
appeared
to
make
an
effort
at
again
he
bowed
i
know
i
hope
what
is
due
to
the
lady
mary
deller
to
to
answer
you
as
as
befits
but
you
shall
hear
from
me
sir
you
shall
hear
from
he
bowed
a
third
time
a
bow
that
took
in
the
entire
company
and
withdrew
in
high
dudgeon
and
with
a
great
show
of
dignity
a
pause
ensued
and
then
the
lady
mary
reproved
caryll
oh
was
cruel
in
you
sir
she
cried
poor
craske
and
to
dub
him
plagiarist
was
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
truth
madam
is
never
oh
fie
you
make
bad
worse
she
cried
he
put
you
in
the
pillory
of
his
verse
for
this
laughed
collis
ye
be
most
scurvily
lampooned
poor
craske
sighed
the
lady
mary
again
poor
indeed
but
not
in
the
sense
to
deserve
pity
an
upstart
impostor
such
as
that
to
soil
a
lady
with
his
criticism
lady
mary
brows
went
up
you
use
a
singular
severity
sir
she
opined
and
i
think
it
unwise
in
you
to
grow
so
hot
in
the
defence
of
a
reputation
whose
owner
has
so
little
care
for
it
caryll
looked
at
her
out
of
his
level
eyes
a
hot
answer
quivered
on
his
tongue
an
answer
that
had
crushed
her
venom
for
some
time
and
had
probably
left
him
with
a
quarrel
on
his
hands
yet
his
smile
as
he
considered
her
was
very
sweet
so
sweet
that
her
ladyship
guessing
nothing
of
the
bitterness
it
was
used
to
cover
went
as
near
a
smirk
as
it
was
possible
for
one
so
elegant
he
was
she
judged
another
victim
ripe
for
immolation
on
the
altar
of
her
goddessship
and
caryll
who
had
taken
her
measure
very
thoroughly
seeing
something
of
how
her
thoughts
were
running
bethought
him
of
a
sweeter
vengeance
lady
mary
he
cried
a
soft
reproach
in
his
voice
i
have
been
sore
mistook
in
you
if
you
are
one
to
be
guided
by
the
and
he
waved
a
hand
toward
the
modish
throng
she
knit
her
fine
brows
bewildered
ah
he
cried
interpreting
her
glance
to
suit
his
ends
perish
the
thought
indeed
i
knew
that
i
could
not
be
wrong
i
knew
that
one
so
peerless
in
all
else
must
be
peerless
too
in
her
opinions
judging
for
herself
and
standing
firm
upon
her
judgment
in
disdain
of
meaner
souls
mere
sheep
to
follow
their
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
said
nothing
being
too
intrigued
by
this
sudden
and
most
sweet
flattery
her
mere
beauty
had
oft
been
praised
and
in
terms
that
glowed
like
fire
but
what
was
that
compared
with
this
fine
appreciation
of
her
less
obvious
mental
parts
and
that
from
one
who
had
seen
the
world
caryll
was
bending
over
her
what
a
chance
is
here
he
was
murmuring
to
mark
your
lofty
detachment
to
show
how
utter
is
your
indifference
to
what
the
common
herd
may
as
as
how
she
asked
blinking
up
at
him
the
others
stood
at
gaze
scarce
yet
suspecting
the
drift
of
so
much
talk
there
is
a
poor
lady
yonder
of
whose
fair
name
a
bubble
is
being
blown
and
pricked
i
dare
swear
there
not
a
woman
here
durst
speak
to
her
yet
what
a
chance
for
one
that
dared
how
fine
a
triumph
would
be
hers
he
sighed
heigho
i
almost
wish
i
were
a
woman
that
i
might
make
that
triumph
mine
and
mark
my
superiority
to
these
painted
dolls
that
have
neither
wit
nor
the
lady
mary
rose
a
faint
color
in
her
cheeks
a
sparkle
in
her
fine
eyes
a
great
joy
flashed
into
caryll
in
quick
response
a
joy
in
her
she
thought
with
ready
vanity
and
a
heightening
admiration
will
you
make
it
yours
as
it
should
be
as
it
must
ever
be
to
lead
and
not
to
follow
he
cried
flattering
incredibility
trembling
in
his
voice
and
why
not
sir
she
demanded
now
thoroughly
aroused
why
not
indeed
since
you
are
you
quoth
he
it
is
what
i
had
hoped
in
you
and
yet
and
yet
what
i
had
almost
feared
to
she
frowned
upon
him
now
so
excellently
had
he
done
his
work
why
should
you
have
feared
that
alas
i
am
a
man
of
little
faith
unworthy
indeed
your
good
opinion
since
i
entertained
a
doubt
it
was
a
she
smiled
again
you
acknowledge
your
faults
with
such
a
grace
said
she
that
we
must
needs
forgive
them
and
now
to
show
you
how
much
you
need
forgiveness
come
children
she
bade
her
cousins
for
whose
innocence
she
had
made
apology
but
a
moment
back
your
arm
harry
she
begged
her
sir
harry
obeyed
her
readily
but
without
eagerness
in
his
heart
he
cursed
his
friend
caryll
for
having
set
her
on
to
this
caryll
himself
hung
upon
her
other
side
his
eyes
toward
lady
ostermore
and
hortensia
who
whilst
being
observed
by
all
were
being
approached
by
few
and
these
few
confined
themselves
to
an
exchange
of
greetings
with
her
ladyship
which
constituted
a
worse
offence
to
mistress
winthrop
than
had
they
stayed
away
suddenly
as
if
drawn
by
his
ardent
gaze
hortensia
eyes
moved
at
last
from
their
forward
fixity
her
glance
met
caryll
across
the
intervening
space
instantly
he
swept
off
his
hat
and
bowed
profoundly
the
action
drew
attention
to
himself
all
eyes
were
focussed
upon
him
and
between
many
a
pair
there
was
a
frown
for
one
who
should
dare
thus
to
run
counter
to
the
general
attitude
but
there
was
more
to
follow
the
lady
mary
accepted
salutation
of
hortensia
as
a
signal
she
led
the
way
promptly
and
the
little
band
swept
forward
straight
for
its
goal
raked
by
the
volleys
from
a
thousand
eyes
under
which
the
lady
mary
already
began
to
giggle
excitedly
thus
they
reached
the
countess
the
countess
standing
very
rigid
in
her
amazement
to
receive
them
i
hope
i
see
your
ladyship
well
said
lady
mary
i
hope
your
ladyship
does
answered
the
countess
tartly
mistress
winthrop
eyes
were
lowered
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
her
distress
was
plain
born
of
her
doubt
of
the
lady
mary
purpose
and
suspense
as
to
what
might
follow
i
have
not
the
honor
of
your
ward
acquaintance
lady
ostermore
said
lady
mary
whilst
the
men
were
bowing
and
her
cousins
curtseying
to
the
countess
and
her
companion
collectively
the
countess
gasped
recovered
and
eyed
the
speaker
without
any
sign
of
affection
my
husband
ward
she
corrected
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
discourage
further
mention
of
hortensia
is
but
a
distinction
put
in
caryll
suggestively
indeed
yes
will
not
your
ladyship
present
me
the
malevolent
eyes
turned
a
moment
upon
caryll
smiling
demurely
at
lady
mary
elbow
in
his
face
as
well
as
in
the
four
words
he
had
uttered
she
saw
that
here
was
work
of
his
and
he
gained
nothing
in
her
favor
by
it
meanwhile
there
were
no
grounds
other
than
such
as
must
have
been
wantonly
offensive
to
the
lady
mary
and
so
not
to
be
dreamed
of
upon
which
to
refuse
her
request
the
countess
braced
herself
and
with
an
ill
grace
performed
the
brief
ceremony
of
presentation
mistress
winthrop
looked
up
an
instant
then
down
again
it
was
a
piteous
almost
a
pleading
glance
lady
mary
leaving
the
countess
to
sir
harry
stapleton
caryll
and
the
others
moved
to
hortensia
side
for
a
moment
she
was
at
loss
what
to
say
and
took
refuge
in
a
commonplace
i
have
long
desired
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
said
she
i
am
honored
madam
replied
hortensia
with
downcast
eyes
then
lifting
them
with
almost
disconcerting
suddenness
your
ladyship
has
chosen
an
odd
season
in
which
to
gratify
this
desire
with
which
you
honor
lady
mary
laughed
as
much
at
the
remark
as
for
the
benefit
of
those
whose
eyes
were
upon
her
she
knew
there
would
not
be
wanting
many
who
would
condemn
her
but
these
should
be
far
outnumbered
by
those
who
would
be
lost
in
admiration
of
her
daring
that
she
could
so
fly
in
the
face
of
public
opinion
and
she
was
grateful
to
caryll
for
having
suggested
to
her
a
course
of
such
distinction
i
could
have
chosen
no
better
season
she
replied
to
mark
my
scorn
of
evil
tongues
and
color
stained
hortensia
cheek
again
gratitude
glowed
in
her
eyes
you
are
very
noble
madam
she
answered
with
flattering
earnestness
la
said
the
lady
mary
is
nobility
then
so
easily
achieved
and
thereafter
they
talked
of
inconsequent
trifles
until
caryll
moved
towards
them
and
lady
mary
turned
aside
to
speak
to
the
countess
at
caryll
approach
hortensia
eyes
had
been
lowered
again
and
she
made
no
offer
to
address
him
as
he
stood
before
her
now
hat
under
arm
leaning
easily
upon
his
amber
cane
oh
heart
of
stone
said
he
at
last
am
i
not
yet
forgiven
she
misread
his
meaning
perhaps
already
the
suspicion
she
now
voiced
had
been
in
her
mind
she
looked
up
at
him
sharply
was
it
was
it
you
who
fetched
the
lady
mary
to
me
she
inquired
lo
said
he
you
have
a
voice
now
heaven
be
praised
i
was
fearing
it
was
lost
for
me
that
you
had
made
some
awful
vow
never
again
to
rejoice
my
ears
with
the
music
of
you
have
not
answered
my
question
she
reminded
him
nor
you
mine
said
he
i
asked
you
am
i
not
yet
forgiven
what
for
being
born
an
impudent
fleering
coxcomb
twas
that
you
called
me
i
she
flushed
deeply
if
you
would
win
forgiveness
you
should
not
remind
me
of
the
offence
she
answered
low
nay
he
rejoined
that
is
to
confound
forgiveness
with
forgetfulness
i
want
you
to
forgive
and
yet
to
that
were
to
what
else
is
nothing
less
will
satisfy
you
expect
too
much
she
answered
with
a
touch
that
was
almost
of
sternness
he
shrugged
and
smiled
whimsically
it
is
my
way
he
said
apologetically
nature
has
made
me
expectant
and
life
whilst
showing
me
the
folly
of
it
has
not
yet
cured
she
looked
at
him
and
repeated
her
earlier
question
was
it
at
your
bidding
that
lady
mary
came
to
speak
with
me
fie
he
cried
what
insinuations
do
you
make
against
her
insinuations
what
else
that
she
should
do
things
at
my
bidding
she
smiled
understanding
you
have
a
talent
sir
for
crooked
is
to
conceal
the
rectitude
of
my
it
fails
of
its
object
then
said
she
for
it
deludes
no
she
paused
and
laughed
at
his
look
of
assumed
blankness
i
am
deeply
beholden
to
you
she
whispered
quickly
breathing
at
once
gratitude
and
confusion
though
i
do
descry
the
cause
said
he
be
something
to
comfort
more
he
might
have
added
then
for
the
mad
mood
was
upon
him
awakened
by
those
soft
brown
eyes
of
hers
but
in
that
moment
the
others
of
that
little
party
crowded
upon
them
to
take
their
leave
of
mistress
winthrop
caryll
felt
satisfied
that
enough
had
been
done
to
curb
the
slander
concerning
hortensia
but
he
was
not
long
in
learning
how
profound
was
his
mistake
on
every
side
he
continued
to
hear
her
discussed
and
in
such
terms
as
made
his
ears
tingle
and
his
hands
itch
to
be
at
work
in
her
defence
for
with
smirks
and
sneers
and
innuendoes
her
escapade
with
lord
rotherby
continued
to
furnish
a
topic
for
the
town
as
her
ladyship
had
sworn
it
would
yet
by
what
right
could
he
espouse
her
cause
with
any
one
of
her
defamers
without
bringing
her
fair
name
into
still
more
odious
notoriety
and
meanwhile
he
knew
that
he
was
under
strict
surveillance
from
green
knew
that
he
was
watched
wherever
he
went
and
nothing
but
his
confidence
that
no
evidence
could
be
produced
against
him
allowed
him
to
remain
as
he
did
all
unconcerned
of
this
leduc
had
more
than
once
seen
green
about
old
palace
yard
besides
a
couple
of
his
underlings
one
or
the
other
of
whom
was
never
absent
from
the
place
no
doubt
with
intent
to
observe
who
came
and
went
at
caryll
once
indeed
during
the
absence
of
master
and
servant
caryll
lodging
was
broken
into
and
on
leduc
return
he
found
a
confusion
which
told
him
how
thoroughly
the
place
had
been
ransacked
if
caryll
had
had
anything
to
hide
this
would
have
given
him
the
hint
to
take
his
precautions
but
as
he
had
nothing
that
was
in
the
least
degree
in
incriminating
he
went
his
ways
in
supremest
unconcern
of
the
vigilance
exerted
over
him
he
used
however
a
greater
discretion
in
the
resorts
he
frequented
and
if
upon
occasion
he
visited
such
tory
as
the
bell
tavern
in
king
street
or
the
in
pall
mall
he
was
still
more
often
to
be
found
at
white
that
resort
it
was
at
this
latter
house
one
evening
three
or
four
days
after
his
meeting
with
hortensia
in
the
park
that
the
chance
was
afforded
him
at
last
of
vindicating
her
honor
in
a
manner
that
need
not
add
to
the
scandal
that
was
already
abroad
nor
serve
to
couple
his
name
with
hers
unduly
and
it
was
lord
rotherby
himself
who
afforded
him
the
opportunity
the
thing
fell
out
in
this
wise
caryll
was
at
cards
with
harry
collis
and
stapleton
and
major
gascoigne
in
a
room
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
others
present
some
also
at
play
others
merely
lounging
of
the
latter
was
his
grace
of
wharton
he
was
a
slender
graceful
gentleman
whose
face
if
slightly
effeminate
and
markedly
dissipated
was
nevertheless
of
considerable
beauty
he
was
very
splendid
in
a
suit
of
green
camlett
and
silver
lace
and
he
wore
a
flaxen
periwig
without
powder
he
was
awaiting
rotherby
with
whom
as
he
told
the
company
he
was
for
a
frolic
at
drury
lane
where
a
ridotto
was
following
the
play
he
spoke
as
usual
in
a
loud
voice
that
all
might
hear
and
his
talk
was
loose
and
heavily
salted
as
became
the
talk
of
a
rake
of
his
exalted
rank
it
was
chiefly
concerned
with
airing
his
bitter
grievance
against
girdlebank
of
the
theatre
royal
of
whom
he
announced
himself
devilishly
he
inveighed
against
her
that
she
should
have
the
gross
vulgarity
to
love
her
husband
and
against
her
husband
that
he
should
have
the
audacity
to
play
the
watchdog
over
her
and
bark
and
growl
at
the
approach
a
plague
on
all
husbands
say
i
ended
the
worthy
president
of
the
bold
bucks
nay
now
but
i
a
husband
myself
gad
protested
sidney
who
was
quite
the
most
delicate
mincing
man
of
fashion
about
town
and
one
of
that
valetaille
that
hovered
about
his
grace
of
wharton
heels
is
no
matter
in
your
case
said
the
duke
with
that
contempt
he
used
towards
his
followers
your
wife
too
ugly
to
be
looked
and
sidney
fresh
protest
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
laughter
that
went
up
to
applaud
that
brutal
frankness
caryll
turned
to
the
fop
who
happened
to
be
standing
at
his
elbow
never
repine
man
said
he
in
the
company
you
keep
such
a
wife
makes
for
peace
of
mind
to
have
that
is
to
have
wharton
resumed
his
railings
at
the
girdlebanks
and
was
still
at
them
when
rotherby
came
in
at
last
charles
the
duke
hailed
him
rising
another
minute
and
i
had
gone
without
but
rotherby
scarce
looked
at
him
and
answered
with
unwonted
shortness
his
eyes
had
discovered
caryll
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
run
against
him
since
that
day
over
a
week
ago
at
stretton
house
and
at
sight
of
him
now
all
rotherby
spleen
was
moved
he
stood
and
stared
his
dark
eyes
narrowing
his
cheeks
flushing
slightly
under
their
tan
wharton
who
had
approached
him
observing
his
sudden
halt
his
sudden
look
of
concentration
asked
him
shortly
what
might
ail
him
i
have
seen
someone
i
did
not
expect
to
find
in
a
resort
of
gentlemen
said
rotherby
his
eyes
ever
on
caryll
who
engrossed
in
his
game
was
all
unconscious
of
his
lordship
advent
wharton
followed
the
direction
of
his
companion
gaze
and
giving
now
attention
himself
to
caryll
he
fell
to
appraising
his
genteel
appearance
negligent
of
the
insinuation
in
what
rotherby
had
said
swore
the
duke
is
a
man
of
taste
a
travelled
gentleman
by
his
air
behold
me
the
grace
of
that
charles
and
the
set
of
that
most
admirable
coat
fifty
guineas
would
buy
his
steinkirk
who
is
this
beau
i
present
him
to
your
grace
said
rotherby
shortly
he
had
pretentions
at
being
a
beau
himself
but
his
grace
supreme
arbiter
in
such
matters
had
never
yet
remarked
it
they
moved
across
the
room
greetings
passing
as
they
went
at
their
approach
caryll
looked
up
rotherby
made
him
a
leg
with
an
excessive
show
of
deference
arguing
irony
is
an
pleasure
to
meet
you
here
sir
said
he
in
a
tone
that
drew
the
attention
of
all
present
no
pleasures
are
so
sweet
as
the
unexpected
answered
caryll
with
casual
amiability
and
since
he
perceived
at
once
the
errand
upon
which
lord
rotherby
was
come
to
him
he
went
to
meet
him
has
your
lordship
been
contracting
any
marriages
of
late
he
inquired
the
viscount
smiled
icily
you
have
quick
wits
sir
said
he
which
is
as
it
should
be
in
one
who
lives
by
let
your
lordship
be
thankful
that
such
is
not
your
own
case
returned
caryll
with
imperturbable
good
humor
and
sent
a
titter
round
the
room
a
hit
a
shrewd
hit
honor
cried
wharton
tapping
his
i
vow
to
gad
ye
undone
charles
ye
better
play
at
repartee
with
gascoigne
there
ye
more
of
a
your
grace
cried
rotherby
suppressing
at
great
cost
his
passion
is
not
to
be
borne
that
a
fellow
of
this
condition
should
sit
among
men
of
and
with
that
he
swung
round
and
addressed
the
company
in
general
gentlemen
do
you
know
who
this
fellow
is
he
has
the
effrontery
to
take
my
name
and
call
himself
caryll
looked
a
moment
at
his
brother
in
the
silence
that
followed
then
as
in
a
flash
he
saw
his
chance
of
vindicating
mistress
winthrop
and
he
seized
it
and
do
you
know
gentlemen
who
this
fellow
is
he
inquired
with
an
air
of
sly
amusement
he
is
nay
you
shall
judge
for
yourselves
you
shall
hear
the
story
of
how
we
met
it
is
the
story
of
his
abduction
of
a
lady
whose
name
need
not
be
mentioned
the
story
of
his
dastardly
attempt
to
cozen
her
into
a
mock
cried
the
duke
and
a
dozen
others
with
him
some
in
surprise
but
most
in
an
unbelief
that
was
already
faintly
tinged
with
horror
which
argued
ill
for
my
lord
rotherby
when
the
story
should
be
told
you
damned
rogue
began
his
lordship
and
would
have
flung
himself
upon
caryll
but
that
collis
and
stapleton
and
wharton
himself
put
forth
hands
to
stay
him
by
main
force
others
too
had
risen
but
caryll
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
idly
fingering
the
cards
before
him
and
smiling
gently
between
amusement
and
irony
he
was
much
mistaken
if
he
did
not
make
lord
rotherby
bitterly
regret
the
initiative
he
had
taken
in
their
quarrel
gently
my
lord
the
duke
admonished
the
viscount
this
this
gentleman
has
said
that
which
touches
your
honor
he
shall
say
more
he
shall
make
good
his
words
or
eat
them
but
the
matter
can
not
rest
it
shall
not
by
god
swore
rotherby
purple
now
it
shall
not
kill
him
like
a
dog
for
what
he
has
but
before
i
die
gentlemen
said
caryll
it
were
well
that
you
should
have
the
full
story
of
that
sorry
adventure
from
an
an
were
ye
present
cried
two
or
three
in
a
breath
i
desire
to
lay
before
you
all
the
story
of
how
we
met
my
lord
there
and
i
it
is
so
closely
enmeshed
with
the
story
of
that
abduction
and
that
the
one
is
scarce
to
be
distinguished
from
the
rotherby
writhed
to
shake
off
those
who
held
him
will
ye
listen
to
this
fellow
he
roared
he
a
spy
i
tell
you
a
jacobite
spy
he
was
beside
himself
with
anger
and
apprehension
and
he
never
paused
to
weigh
the
words
he
uttered
it
was
with
him
a
question
of
stopping
his
accuser
mouth
with
whatever
mud
came
under
his
hands
he
has
no
right
here
it
is
not
to
be
borne
i
know
not
by
what
means
he
has
thrust
himself
among
you
but
that
is
a
knowledge
i
can
afford
your
lordship
came
steady
voice
to
interrupt
the
speaker
mr
caryll
is
here
by
my
and
by
mine
and
gascoigne
here
added
sir
harry
collis
and
i
will
answer
for
his
quality
to
any
man
who
doubts
rotherby
glared
at
caryll
sponsors
struck
dumb
by
this
sudden
and
unexpected
refutation
of
the
charge
he
had
leveled
wharton
who
had
stepped
aside
knit
his
brows
and
flashed
his
through
sheer
force
of
habit
upon
lord
rotherby
then
you
pardon
me
harry
said
he
but
you
see
i
hope
that
the
question
is
not
impertinent
that
i
put
it
to
the
end
that
we
may
clearly
know
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
and
what
consideration
to
extend
him
what
credit
to
attach
to
the
communication
he
is
to
make
us
touching
my
lord
here
under
what
circumstances
did
you
become
acquainted
with
caryll
i
have
known
him
these
twelve
years
answered
collis
promptly
so
has
stapleton
so
has
gascoigne
so
have
a
dozen
other
gentlemen
who
could
be
produced
and
who
like
ourselves
were
at
oxford
with
him
for
myself
and
stapleton
i
can
say
that
our
acquaintance
indeed
i
should
say
our
friendship
with
caryll
has
been
continuous
since
then
and
that
we
have
visited
him
on
several
occasions
at
his
estate
of
maligny
in
normandy
that
he
habitually
inhabits
the
country
of
his
birth
is
the
reason
why
caryll
has
not
hitherto
had
the
advantage
of
your
acquaintance
need
i
say
more
to
efface
the
false
statement
made
by
my
lord
rotherby
false
do
you
dare
give
me
the
lie
sir
roared
rotherby
but
the
duke
soothed
him
under
his
profligate
exterior
his
grace
of
wharton
concealed
indeed
wasted
a
deal
of
shrewdness
ability
and
inherent
strength
one
thing
at
a
time
my
lord
said
the
president
of
the
bold
bucks
let
us
attend
to
the
matter
of
dons
and
the
devil
does
your
grace
take
sides
with
him
i
take
no
sides
but
i
owe
it
to
myself
we
all
owe
it
to
ourselves
that
this
matter
should
be
rotherby
leered
at
him
his
lip
trembling
with
anger
does
the
president
of
the
bold
bucks
pretend
to
administrate
a
court
of
honor
he
sneered
heavily
your
lordship
will
gain
little
by
this
wharton
admonished
him
so
coldly
that
rotherby
belatedly
came
to
some
portion
of
his
senses
again
the
duke
turned
to
caryll
mr
caryll
said
he
sir
harry
has
given
you
very
handsome
credentials
which
would
seem
to
prove
you
worthy
the
hospitality
of
white
you
have
however
permitted
yourself
certain
expressions
concerning
his
lordship
here
which
we
can
not
allow
to
remain
where
you
have
left
them
you
must
retract
sir
or
make
them
his
gravity
and
the
preciseness
of
his
diction
now
sorted
most
oddly
with
his
foppish
airs
caryll
closed
his
with
a
snap
a
hush
fell
instantly
upon
the
company
which
by
now
was
all
crowding
about
the
little
table
at
which
sat
caryll
and
his
three
friends
a
footman
who
entered
at
the
moment
to
snuff
the
candles
and
see
what
the
gentlemen
might
be
requiring
was
dismissed
the
room
when
the
door
had
closed
caryll
began
to
speak
one
more
attempt
was
made
by
rotherby
to
interfere
but
this
attempt
was
disposed
of
by
wharton
who
had
constituted
himself
entirely
master
of
the
proceedings
if
you
will
not
allow
caryll
to
speak
we
shall
infer
that
you
fear
what
he
may
have
to
say
you
will
compel
us
to
hear
him
in
your
absence
and
i
can
not
think
that
you
would
prefer
that
my
my
lord
fell
silent
he
was
breathing
heavily
and
his
face
was
pale
his
eyes
angry
beyond
words
what
time
caryll
in
amiable
musical
voice
with
its
precise
and
at
moments
slightly
foreign
enunciation
unfolded
the
shameful
story
of
the
affair
at
the
adam
and
eve
at
maidstone
he
told
a
plain
straightforward
tale
making
little
attempt
to
reproduce
any
of
its
color
giving
his
audience
purely
and
simply
the
facts
that
had
taken
place
he
told
how
he
himself
had
been
chosen
as
a
witness
when
my
lord
had
heard
that
there
was
a
traveller
from
france
in
the
house
and
showed
how
that
slight
circumstance
had
first
awakened
his
suspicions
of
foul
play
he
provoked
some
amusement
when
he
dealt
with
his
detection
and
exposure
of
the
sham
parson
but
in
the
main
he
was
heard
with
a
stern
and
ominous
attention
ominous
for
lord
rotherby
rakes
these
men
admittedly
were
with
but
few
exceptions
no
ordinary
tale
of
gallantry
could
have
shocked
them
or
provoked
them
to
aught
but
a
contemptuous
mirth
at
the
expense
of
the
victim
male
or
female
they
would
have
thought
little
the
worse
of
a
man
for
running
off
with
the
wife
say
of
one
of
his
acquaintance
they
would
have
thought
nothing
of
his
running
off
with
a
sister
or
a
daughter
so
long
as
it
was
not
of
their
own
all
these
were
fair
game
and
if
the
husband
father
or
brother
could
not
protect
the
wife
sister
or
daughter
that
was
his
the
more
shame
to
him
but
though
they
might
be
fair
game
the
game
had
its
rules
anomalous
as
it
may
seem
these
rules
lord
rotherby
if
the
tale
caryll
told
was
true
had
violated
he
had
practiced
a
cheat
the
more
dastardly
because
the
poor
lady
who
had
so
narrowly
escaped
being
his
victim
had
nether
father
nor
brother
to
avenge
her
and
in
every
eye
that
was
upon
him
lord
rotherby
might
have
read
had
he
had
the
wit
to
do
so
the
very
sternest
condemnation
a
pretty
story
as
i
a
soul
was
his
grace
comment
when
caryll
had
done
a
pretty
story
my
lord
rotherby
i
have
a
stomach
for
strong
meat
myself
but
odds
my
life
this
is
too
nauseous
rotherby
glared
at
him
your
grace
is
grown
very
nice
on
a
sudden
he
sneered
the
president
of
the
bold
bucks
the
master
of
the
hell
fire
club
is
most
oddly
squeamish
where
the
diversions
of
another
are
diversions
said
his
grace
his
eyebrows
raised
until
they
all
but
vanished
under
the
golden
curls
of
his
peruke
diversions
ha
i
observe
that
you
make
no
attempt
to
deny
the
story
you
admit
it
then
there
was
a
stir
in
the
group
a
drawing
back
from
his
lordship
he
observed
it
trembling
between
chagrin
and
rage
what
here
he
cried
and
laughed
contemptuously
oh
ah
you
follow
where
his
grace
leads
you
ye
followed
him
so
long
in
lewdness
that
now
yell
follow
him
in
conversion
but
as
for
you
sir
and
he
swung
fiercely
upon
caryll
you
and
your
precious
story
will
you
maintain
it
sword
in
hand
i
can
do
better
answered
caryll
if
any
doubts
my
as
how
i
can
prove
it
categorically
by
well
said
caryll
stapleton
approved
him
and
if
i
say
that
you
lie
you
and
your
witnesses
is
you
will
be
liar
said
caryll
besides
it
is
a
little
late
for
that
cut
in
the
duke
your
grace
cried
rotherby
is
this
affair
yours
no
i
thank
heaven
said
his
grace
and
sat
down
rotherby
scowled
at
the
man
who
until
ten
minutes
ago
had
been
his
friend
and
boon
companion
and
there
was
more
of
contempt
than
anger
in
his
eyes
he
turned
again
to
caryll
who
was
watching
him
with
a
gleam
of
amusement
that
infernally
irritating
amusement
of
his
in
his
eyes
well
he
demanded
foolishly
have
you
naught
to
say
i
had
thought
returned
caryll
that
i
had
said
and
the
duke
laughed
aloud
rotherby
lip
was
curled
ha
you
do
think
now
that
you
may
have
said
too
much
caryll
stifled
a
yawn
do
you
he
inquired
blandly
ay
by
god
too
much
for
a
gentleman
to
leave
possibly
but
what
gentleman
is
concerned
in
this
i
am
thundered
rotherby
i
see
and
how
do
you
conceive
that
you
answer
the
description
rotherby
swore
at
him
with
great
choice
and
variety
you
shall
learn
he
promised
him
my
friends
shall
wait
on
you
i
wonder
who
will
carry
his
message
ventured
collis
to
the
ceiling
rotherby
turned
on
him
fierce
as
a
rat
it
is
a
matter
you
may
discover
to
your
cost
sir
harry
he
snarled
i
think
put
in
his
grace
very
languidly
that
you
are
troubling
the
harmony
that
is
wont
to
reign
his
lordship
stood
still
a
moment
then
quite
suddenly
he
snatched
up
a
candlestick
to
hurl
at
caryll
but
he
had
it
wrenched
from
his
hands
ere
he
could
launch
it
he
stood
a
moment
discomfited
glowering
upon
his
brother
my
friends
shall
wait
on
you
he
repeated
you
said
so
before
caryll
replied
wearily
i
shall
endeavor
to
make
them
his
lordship
nodded
stupidly
and
strode
to
the
door
his
departure
was
observed
in
silence
on
every
face
he
read
his
sentence
these
men
rakes
though
they
were
professedly
would
own
him
no
more
for
their
associate
and
what
these
men
thought
not
a
gentleman
in
town
but
would
be
thinking
the
same
tomorrow
he
had
the
stupidity
to
lay
it
all
to
the
score
of
caryll
not
perceiving
that
he
had
brought
it
upon
himself
by
his
own
aggressiveness
he
paused
his
hand
upon
the
doorknob
and
turned
to
loose
a
last
shaft
at
them
as
for
you
others
that
follow
your
there
and
he
indicated
his
grace
whose
shoulder
was
towards
him
this
matter
ends
not
and
with
that
general
threat
he
passed
out
and
that
snug
room
at
white
knew
him
no
more
major
gascoigne
was
gathering
up
the
cards
that
had
been
flung
down
when
first
the
storm
arose
caryll
bent
to
assist
him
and
the
last
voice
lord
rotherby
heard
as
he
departed
was
caryll
and
the
words
it
uttered
were
come
ned
the
deal
is
with
his
lordship
swore
through
his
teeth
and
went
downstairs
heavily
chapter
spurs
to
the
reluctant
before
caryll
left
white
which
he
did
at
a
comparatively
early
hour
that
he
might
be
at
home
to
receive
lord
rotherby
friends
not
a
man
present
but
had
offered
him
his
services
in
the
affair
he
had
upon
his
hands
wharton
indeed
was
not
to
be
denied
for
one
and
for
the
other
caryll
desired
gascoigne
to
do
him
the
honor
of
representing
him
it
was
a
fine
dry
night
and
feeling
the
need
for
exercise
caryll
set
out
to
walk
the
short
distance
from
james
street
to
his
lodging
with
a
preceding
him
for
only
attendant
arrived
home
he
was
met
by
leduc
with
the
information
that
sir
richard
everard
was
awaiting
him
he
went
in
and
the
next
moment
he
was
in
the
arms
of
his
adoptive
father
greetings
and
minor
courtesies
disposed
of
sir
richard
came
straight
to
the
affair
which
he
had
at
heart
well
how
speeds
the
matter
caryll
face
became
overcast
he
sat
down
a
thought
wearily
so
far
as
lord
ostermore
is
concerned
it
speeds
as
you
would
wish
it
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
paused
and
sighed
i
would
that
it
sped
not
at
all
or
that
i
was
out
of
sir
richard
looked
at
him
with
searching
eyes
how
he
asked
what
would
you
have
me
understand
that
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
between
us
in
spite
of
all
the
arguments
you
have
employed
and
with
which
once
for
a
little
while
you
convinced
me
this
task
is
loathsome
to
me
in
the
last
degree
ostermore
is
my
father
and
i
ca
forget
and
your
mother
sir
richard
tone
was
sad
rather
than
indignant
it
spoke
of
a
bitter
disappointment
not
at
the
events
but
at
this
man
whom
he
loved
with
all
a
father
love
it
were
idle
to
go
over
it
all
again
i
know
everything
that
you
would
that
you
could
say
i
have
said
it
all
to
myself
again
and
again
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
steel
myself
to
the
business
to
which
you
plighted
me
had
ostermore
been
different
perhaps
it
had
been
easier
i
can
not
say
as
it
is
i
see
in
him
a
weakling
a
man
of
inferior
intellect
who
does
not
judge
things
as
you
and
i
judge
them
whose
life
can
not
have
been
guided
by
the
rules
that
serve
for
men
of
stronger
you
find
excuses
for
him
for
his
deed
cried
sir
richard
and
his
voice
was
full
of
horror
now
he
stared
askance
at
his
adoptive
son
no
no
oh
i
do
know
on
my
soul
and
conscience
i
do
know
cried
caryll
like
one
in
pain
he
rose
and
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
no
he
pursued
more
calmly
i
do
excuse
him
i
blame
him
more
bitterly
than
you
can
think
perhaps
more
bitterly
even
than
do
you
for
i
have
had
a
look
into
his
mind
and
see
the
exact
place
held
there
by
my
mother
memory
i
can
judge
and
condemn
him
but
i
execute
him
i
ca
betray
him
i
do
think
i
could
do
it
even
if
he
were
not
my
he
paused
and
leaning
his
hands
upon
the
table
at
which
sir
richard
sat
he
faced
him
and
spoke
in
a
voice
of
earnest
pleading
sir
richard
this
was
not
the
task
to
give
me
or
if
you
had
planned
to
give
it
me
you
should
have
reared
me
differently
you
should
not
have
sought
to
make
of
me
a
gentleman
you
have
brought
me
up
to
principles
of
honor
and
you
ask
me
now
to
outrage
them
to
cast
them
off
and
to
become
a
very
judas
wonderful
i
should
rebel
they
were
hurtful
words
to
sir
richard
the
poor
fanatic
whose
mind
was
all
unsound
on
this
one
point
who
had
lived
in
contemplation
of
his
vengeance
as
a
fasting
monk
lives
through
lent
in
contemplation
of
the
easter
plenty
the
lines
of
sorrow
deepened
in
his
face
justin
he
said
slowly
you
forget
one
thing
honor
is
to
be
used
with
men
of
honor
but
he
who
allows
his
honor
to
stand
a
barrier
between
himself
and
the
man
who
has
wronged
him
by
dishonor
is
no
better
than
a
fool
you
speak
of
yourself
you
think
of
yourself
and
what
of
me
justin
the
things
you
say
of
yourself
apply
in
a
like
degree
nay
even
more
to
ah
but
you
are
not
his
son
oh
believe
me
i
speak
not
hastily
or
lightly
i
have
been
torn
this
way
and
that
in
these
past
days
until
at
moments
the
burden
has
been
heavier
than
i
could
bear
once
for
a
little
while
i
thought
i
could
do
all
and
more
than
you
expect
of
me
the
moment
indeed
in
which
i
took
the
first
step
and
delivered
him
the
letter
but
it
was
a
moment
of
wild
heat
i
cooled
and
reflection
followed
and
since
then
because
so
much
was
done
i
have
not
known
an
instant
peace
of
mind
i
have
endeavored
to
forget
the
position
in
which
i
am
placed
but
i
have
failed
i
can
not
and
if
i
go
through
with
this
thing
i
shall
not
know
another
hour
in
life
that
is
not
poisoned
by
remorse
echoed
sir
richard
between
consternation
and
anger
remorse
he
laughed
bitterly
what
ails
thee
boy
do
you
pretend
that
lord
ostermore
should
go
unpunished
do
you
go
so
far
as
that
not
so
he
has
made
others
suffer
and
it
is
just
as
we
understand
justice
that
he
should
suffer
in
his
turn
though
when
all
is
said
he
is
but
a
poor
egotist
too
to
understand
the
full
vileness
of
his
sin
he
is
suffering
as
it
is
cursed
in
his
son
for
father
of
a
fool
hath
no
joy
he
hates
this
son
of
his
and
his
son
despises
him
his
wife
is
a
shrew
a
termagant
who
embitters
every
hour
of
his
existence
thus
he
drags
out
his
life
unloving
and
unloved
a
thing
to
evoke
pity
cried
sir
richard
in
a
voice
of
thunder
pity
ha
as
i
a
soul
justin
he
shall
be
more
pitiful
yet
ere
i
have
done
with
be
it
so
then
but
if
you
love
me
find
some
other
hand
to
do
the
if
i
love
you
justin
echoed
the
other
and
his
voice
softened
his
eyes
looked
reproachfully
upon
his
adoptive
child
needs
there
an
to
that
are
you
not
all
i
have
my
son
indeed
he
held
out
his
hands
and
justin
took
them
affectionately
and
pressed
them
in
his
own
you
put
these
weak
notions
from
your
mind
justin
and
prove
worthy
the
noble
lady
who
was
your
mother
caryll
moved
aside
again
hanging
his
head
his
face
pale
and
troubled
where
everard
arguments
must
fail
his
own
affection
for
everard
was
like
to
conquer
him
it
was
very
weak
in
him
he
told
himself
but
then
his
love
for
everard
was
strong
and
he
would
fain
spare
everard
the
pain
he
knew
he
must
be
occasioning
him
still
he
did
battle
his
repugnance
up
in
arms
i
would
you
could
see
the
matter
as
i
see
it
he
sighed
this
man
grown
old
and
reaping
in
his
old
age
the
fruits
of
the
egotism
he
has
sown
i
do
not
believe
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
a
single
soul
would
weep
his
lordship
death
if
we
except
perhaps
mistress
and
do
you
pity
him
for
that
quoth
sir
richard
coldly
what
right
has
he
to
expect
aught
else
who
sows
for
himself
reaps
for
himself
i
marvel
indeed
that
there
should
be
even
one
to
bewail
him
to
spare
him
a
kind
and
even
there
mused
caryll
it
is
perhaps
gratitude
rather
than
affection
that
inspires
the
who
is
mistress
winthrop
his
ward
as
sweet
a
lady
i
think
as
i
have
ever
seen
said
caryll
incautious
enthusiasm
assailing
him
sir
richard
eyes
narrowed
you
have
some
acquaintance
with
her
he
suggested
very
briefly
caryll
sketched
for
the
second
time
that
evening
the
circumstances
of
his
first
meeting
with
rotherby
sir
richard
nodded
sardonically
hum
he
is
his
father
son
not
a
doubt
of
that
be
a
most
worthy
successor
to
my
lord
ostermore
but
the
lady
tell
me
of
the
lady
how
comes
she
linked
with
them
i
scarce
know
save
from
the
scraps
that
i
have
heard
her
father
it
would
seem
was
ostermore
friend
and
dying
he
appointed
ostermore
her
guardian
her
fortune
i
take
it
is
very
slender
nevertheless
ostermore
whatever
he
may
have
done
by
other
people
appears
in
this
case
to
have
discharged
his
trust
with
zeal
and
with
affection
but
indeed
who
could
have
done
other
where
that
sweet
lady
was
concerned
you
should
see
her
sir
richard
he
was
pacing
the
room
now
as
he
spoke
and
as
he
spoke
he
warmed
to
his
subject
more
and
more
she
is
middling
tall
of
a
most
dainty
slenderness
with
a
so
sweet
and
saintly
beauty
of
face
that
it
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
and
eyes
lord
the
glory
of
her
eyes
they
are
eyes
that
would
lead
a
man
into
hell
and
make
him
believe
it
heaven
doth
to
her
eyes
repair
to
help
him
of
his
blindness
sir
richard
watched
him
displeasure
growing
in
his
face
so
he
said
at
last
is
that
the
reason
the
reason
of
what
quoth
caryll
recalled
from
his
sweet
rapture
the
reason
of
these
fresh
qualms
of
yours
the
reason
of
all
this
sympathy
for
ostermore
this
unwillingness
to
perform
the
sacred
duty
that
is
nay
on
my
soul
you
do
me
wrong
cried
caryll
indignantly
if
aught
had
been
needed
to
spur
me
on
it
had
been
my
meeting
with
this
lady
it
needed
that
to
make
me
realize
to
the
bitter
full
the
wrong
my
lord
ostermore
has
done
me
in
getting
me
to
make
me
realize
that
i
am
a
man
without
a
name
to
offer
any
but
sir
richard
watching
him
intently
shook
his
head
and
fetched
a
sigh
of
sorrow
and
disdain
pshaw
justin
how
we
befool
ourselves
you
think
it
is
not
so
you
try
to
think
it
is
not
so
but
to
me
it
is
very
plain
a
woman
has
arisen
in
your
life
and
this
woman
seen
but
once
or
twice
unknown
a
week
or
so
ago
suffices
to
eclipse
the
memory
of
your
mother
and
turns
your
aim
in
life
the
avenging
of
her
bitter
wrongs
to
water
oh
justin
justin
i
had
thought
you
your
conclusions
are
all
wrong
i
swear
they
are
wrong
sir
richard
considered
him
sombrely
are
you
sure
quite
quite
sure
caryll
eyes
fell
as
the
doubt
now
entered
his
mind
for
the
first
time
that
it
might
be
indeed
as
sir
richard
was
suggesting
he
was
not
quite
sure
prove
it
to
me
justin
everard
pleaded
prove
it
by
abandoning
this
weakness
where
my
lord
ostermore
is
concerned
remember
only
the
wrong
he
has
done
you
are
the
incarnation
of
that
wrong
and
by
your
hand
must
he
be
he
rose
and
caught
the
younger
man
hands
again
in
his
own
forced
caryll
to
confront
him
he
shall
know
when
the
time
comes
whose
hand
it
was
that
pulled
him
down
he
shall
know
the
nemesis
that
has
lain
in
wait
for
him
these
thirty
years
to
smite
him
at
the
end
and
he
shall
taste
hell
in
this
world
before
he
goes
to
it
in
the
next
it
is
god
own
justice
boy
will
you
be
false
to
the
duty
that
lies
before
you
will
you
forget
your
mother
and
her
sufferings
because
you
have
looked
into
the
eyes
of
this
girl
who
no
no
say
no
more
cried
caryll
his
voice
trembling
you
will
do
it
said
sir
richard
between
question
and
assertion
if
heaven
lends
me
strength
of
purpose
but
it
asks
much
was
the
gloomy
answer
i
am
to
see
lord
ostermore
to
obtain
his
answer
to
king
james
sir
richard
eyes
gleamed
he
released
the
other
hands
and
turned
slowly
to
his
chair
again
it
is
well
he
said
slowly
the
thing
asks
dispatch
or
else
some
of
his
majesty
real
friends
may
be
he
proceeded
to
explain
his
words
i
have
talked
in
vain
with
atterbury
he
will
not
abandon
the
enterprise
even
at
king
commands
he
urges
that
his
majesty
can
have
no
conception
of
how
the
matter
is
advanced
that
he
has
been
laboring
like
hercules
and
that
the
party
is
being
swelled
by
men
of
weight
and
substance
every
day
that
it
is
too
late
to
go
back
and
that
he
will
go
forward
with
the
king
consent
or
without
it
should
he
or
his
agents
approach
ostermore
in
the
meantime
it
will
be
too
late
for
us
to
take
such
measures
as
we
have
concerted
for
to
deliver
up
ostermore
then
would
entail
the
betrayal
of
others
which
is
not
to
be
dreamt
of
so
use
if
i
do
the
thing
at
all
it
shall
be
done
answered
caryll
if
at
all
cried
sir
richard
frowning
again
if
at
all
caryll
turned
to
him
he
crossed
to
the
table
and
leaning
across
it
until
his
face
was
quite
close
to
his
adoptive
father
sir
richard
he
begged
let
us
say
no
more
my
will
is
all
to
do
the
thing
it
is
my
my
instincts
that
rebel
i
think
that
the
day
will
be
carried
by
my
will
i
shall
strive
to
that
end
believe
me
but
let
us
say
no
more
sir
richard
looking
deep
into
caryll
eyes
was
touched
by
something
that
he
saw
my
poor
justin
he
said
gently
then
checking
the
sympathy
as
swiftly
as
it
rose
so
be
it
then
he
said
briskly
you
come
to
me
after
you
have
seen
his
lordship
will
you
not
remain
here
you
have
not
the
room
besides
sir
richard
everard
is
too
well
known
for
a
jacobite
to
be
observed
sharing
your
lodging
i
have
no
right
at
all
in
england
and
there
is
always
the
chance
of
my
being
discovered
i
would
not
pull
you
down
with
me
i
am
lodged
at
the
corner
of
maiden
lane
next
door
to
the
sign
of
golden
flitch
come
to
me
there
after
you
have
seen
lord
he
hesitated
a
moment
he
was
impelled
to
recapitulate
his
injunctions
but
he
forbore
he
put
out
his
hand
abruptly
justin
took
the
hand
and
pressed
it
the
door
opened
and
leduc
entered
captain
mainwaring
and
falgate
are
here
sir
and
would
speak
with
you
he
announced
caryll
knit
his
brows
a
moment
his
acquaintance
with
both
men
was
of
the
slightest
and
it
was
only
upon
reflection
that
he
bethought
him
they
would
no
doubt
be
come
in
the
matter
of
his
affair
with
rotherby
which
in
the
stress
of
his
interview
with
sir
richard
had
been
quite
forgotten
he
nodded
wait
upon
sir
richard
to
the
door
leduc
he
bade
his
man
then
introduce
these
sir
richard
had
drawn
back
a
step
i
trust
neither
of
these
gentlemen
knows
me
he
said
i
would
not
be
seen
here
by
any
that
did
it
might
compromise
but
caryll
belittled
sir
richard
fears
pooh
is
very
unlike
said
he
whereupon
sir
richard
seeing
no
help
for
it
went
out
quickly
leduc
in
attendance
lord
rotherby
friends
in
the
paid
little
heed
to
him
as
he
passed
briskly
through
surveillance
came
rather
from
an
entirely
unsuspected
quarter
as
he
left
the
house
and
crossed
the
square
a
figure
detached
itself
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
set
out
to
follow
it
hung
in
his
rear
through
the
filthy
labyrinthine
streets
which
sir
richard
took
to
charing
cross
followed
him
along
the
strand
and
up
bedford
street
and
took
note
of
the
house
he
entered
at
the
corner
of
maiden
lane
chapter
xi
the
the
meeting
was
appointed
by
my
lord
rotherby
for
seven
next
morning
in
lincoln
inn
fields
it
is
true
that
lincoln
inn
fields
at
an
early
hour
of
the
day
was
accounted
a
convenient
spot
for
the
transaction
of
such
business
as
this
yet
considering
that
it
was
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
stretton
house
overlooked
indeed
by
the
windows
of
that
mansion
it
is
not
easy
to
rid
the
mind
of
a
suspicion
that
rotherby
appointed
that
place
of
purpose
set
and
with
intent
to
mark
his
contempt
and
defiance
of
his
father
with
whom
he
supposed
caryll
to
be
in
some
league
accompanied
by
the
duke
of
wharton
and
major
gascoigne
caryll
entered
the
enclosure
promptly
as
seven
was
striking
from
clement
danes
they
had
come
in
a
coach
which
they
had
left
in
waiting
at
the
corner
of
portugal
row
as
they
penetrated
beyond
the
belt
of
trees
they
found
that
they
were
the
first
in
the
field
and
his
grace
proceeded
with
the
major
to
inspect
the
ground
so
that
time
might
be
saved
against
the
coming
of
the
other
party
caryll
stood
apart
breathing
the
freshness
of
the
sunlit
morning
but
supremely
indifferent
to
its
glory
he
was
gloomy
and
preoccupied
he
had
slept
ill
that
night
after
his
interview
with
sir
richard
tormented
by
the
odious
choice
that
lay
before
him
of
either
breaking
with
the
adoptive
father
to
whom
he
owed
obedience
and
affection
or
betraying
his
natural
father
whom
he
had
every
reason
to
hate
yet
who
remained
his
father
he
had
been
able
to
arrive
at
no
solution
duty
seemed
to
point
one
way
instinct
the
other
down
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
when
the
moment
came
it
would
be
the
behests
of
instinct
that
he
would
obey
and
in
obeying
them
play
false
to
sir
richard
and
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
it
was
the
only
course
that
went
with
honor
and
yet
it
was
a
course
that
must
lead
to
a
break
with
the
one
friend
he
had
in
the
world
the
one
man
who
stood
to
him
for
family
and
kin
and
now
as
if
that
were
not
enough
to
plague
him
there
was
this
quarrel
with
rotherby
which
he
had
upon
his
hands
that
too
he
had
been
considering
during
the
wakeful
hours
of
that
summer
night
had
he
reflected
he
must
have
seen
that
no
other
result
could
have
followed
his
narrative
at
white
last
night
and
yet
it
was
a
case
in
which
reflection
would
not
have
stayed
him
hortensia
winthrop
fair
name
was
to
be
cleansed
of
the
smirch
that
had
been
cast
upon
it
and
justin
was
the
only
man
in
whose
power
it
had
lain
to
do
it
more
than
that
if
more
were
needed
it
was
rotherby
himself
by
his
aggressiveness
who
had
thrust
caryll
into
a
position
which
almost
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
explain
himself
and
that
he
could
scarcely
have
done
by
any
other
than
the
means
which
he
had
adopted
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
matter
would
have
troubled
him
not
at
all
this
meeting
with
such
a
man
as
rotherby
would
not
have
robbed
him
of
a
moment
sleep
but
there
came
the
reflection
belatedly
that
rotherby
was
his
brother
his
father
son
and
he
experienced
just
the
same
degree
of
repugnance
at
the
prospect
of
crossing
swords
with
him
as
he
did
at
the
prospect
of
betraying
lord
ostermore
sir
richard
would
force
upon
him
a
task
fate
a
fratricide
truly
he
thought
it
was
an
enviable
position
his
pacing
the
turf
on
which
the
dew
still
gleamed
and
sparkled
he
pondered
his
course
and
wondered
now
at
the
last
moment
was
there
no
way
to
avert
this
meeting
could
not
the
matter
be
arranged
he
was
stirred
out
of
his
musings
by
gascoigne
voice
raised
to
curse
the
tardiness
of
lord
rotherby
where
does
the
fellow
tarry
was
he
so
drunk
last
night
that
he
not
yet
slept
himself
sober
the
streets
are
astir
put
in
wharton
helping
himself
to
snuff
and
indeed
the
cries
of
the
morning
hawkers
reached
them
now
from
the
four
sides
of
the
square
if
his
lordship
does
not
come
soon
i
doubt
if
we
may
stay
for
him
we
shall
have
half
the
town
for
who
are
these
quoth
gascoigne
stepping
aside
and
craning
his
neck
to
get
a
better
view
ah
here
they
and
he
indicated
a
group
of
three
that
had
that
moment
passed
the
palings
gascoigne
and
wharton
went
to
meet
the
newcomers
lord
rotherby
was
attended
by
mainwaring
a
militia
captain
a
great
burly
scarred
bully
of
a
man
and
a
falgate
an
extravagant
young
buck
of
his
acquaintance
an
odder
pair
of
sponsors
he
could
not
have
found
had
he
been
at
pains
to
choose
them
so
adso
swore
falgate
in
his
shrill
affected
voice
i
vow
is
a
most
ungenteel
hour
this
for
men
of
quality
to
be
abroad
i
had
my
beauty
sleep
broke
into
to
be
here
in
time
lard
i
shall
be
dozing
all
day
he
took
off
his
hat
and
delicately
mopped
his
brow
with
a
square
of
lace
he
called
a
handkerchief
shall
we
come
to
business
gentlemen
quoth
mainwaring
gruffly
with
all
my
heart
answered
wharton
it
is
growing
late
la
my
dears
clucked
falgate
in
horror
has
your
grace
not
been
to
bed
yet
to
save
time
said
gascoigne
we
have
made
an
inspection
of
the
ground
and
we
think
that
under
the
trees
yonder
is
a
spot
not
to
be
mainwaring
flashed
a
critical
and
experienced
eye
over
the
place
the
sun
is
so
he
said
looking
up
yes
it
should
serve
well
enough
i
it
will
not
serve
at
all
cried
rotherby
who
stood
a
pace
or
two
apart
a
little
to
the
right
there
the
turf
is
but
there
is
no
protection
put
in
the
duke
you
will
be
under
observation
from
that
side
of
the
square
including
stretton
what
odds
quoth
rotherby
do
i
care
who
overlooks
us
and
he
laughed
unpleasantly
or
is
your
grace
ashamed
of
being
seen
in
your
friend
company
wharton
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
a
moment
then
turned
to
his
lordship
seconds
if
caryll
is
of
the
same
mind
as
his
lordship
we
had
best
get
to
work
at
once
he
said
and
bowing
to
them
withdrew
with
gascoigne
see
to
the
swords
mainwaring
said
rotherby
shortly
here
fanny
this
to
falgate
whose
name
was
francis
and
who
delighted
in
the
feminine
diminutive
which
his
intimates
used
toward
him
come
help
me
with
my
i
vow
to
gad
protested
falgate
advancing
to
the
task
i
make
but
an
indifferent
valet
my
caryll
stood
thoughtful
a
moment
when
rotherby
wishes
had
been
made
known
to
him
the
odd
irony
of
the
situation
the
key
to
which
he
was
the
only
one
to
hold
was
borne
in
upon
him
he
fetched
a
sigh
of
utter
weariness
i
have
said
he
the
greatest
repugnance
to
meeting
his
is
little
wonder
returned
his
grace
contemptuously
but
since
is
forced
upon
you
i
hope
you
give
him
the
lesson
in
manners
that
he
is
it
is
it
unavoidable
quoth
caryll
unavoidable
wharton
looked
at
him
in
stern
wonder
gascoigne
too
swung
round
to
stare
unavoidable
what
can
you
mean
caryll
i
mean
is
the
matter
not
to
be
arranged
in
any
way
must
the
duel
take
place
his
grace
of
wharton
stroked
his
chin
contemplatively
his
eye
ironical
his
lip
curling
never
so
slightly
why
said
he
at
length
you
may
beg
my
lord
rotherby
pardon
for
having
given
him
the
lie
you
may
retract
and
brand
yourself
a
liar
and
your
version
of
the
maidstone
affair
a
silly
invention
which
ye
have
not
the
courage
to
maintain
you
may
do
that
caryll
for
my
own
sake
let
me
add
i
hope
you
will
not
do
i
am
not
thinking
of
your
grace
at
all
said
caryll
slightly
piqued
by
the
tone
the
other
took
with
him
but
to
relieve
your
mind
of
such
doubts
as
i
see
you
entertain
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
out
of
no
motives
of
weakness
that
i
boggle
at
this
combat
though
i
confess
that
i
am
no
ferrailleur
and
that
i
abhor
the
duel
as
a
means
of
settling
a
difference
just
as
i
abhor
all
things
that
are
stupid
and
insensate
yet
i
am
not
the
man
to
shirk
an
encounter
where
an
encounter
is
forced
upon
me
but
in
this
affair
he
paused
then
ended
there
is
more
than
meets
your
grace
eye
or
indeed
he
was
so
calm
so
master
of
himself
that
wharton
perceived
how
groundless
must
have
been
his
first
notion
whatever
might
be
caryll
motives
it
was
plain
from
his
most
perfect
composure
that
they
were
not
motives
of
fear
his
grace
smile
was
dissipated
this
is
mere
trifling
caryll
he
reminded
his
principal
and
time
is
speeding
your
withdrawal
now
would
not
only
be
damaging
to
yourself
it
would
be
damaging
to
the
lady
of
whose
fair
name
you
have
made
yourself
the
champion
you
must
see
that
it
is
too
late
for
doubts
on
the
score
of
this
ay
by
god
swore
gascoigne
hotly
what
a
pox
ails
you
caryll
caryll
took
off
his
hat
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
behind
him
we
must
go
on
then
said
he
gascoigne
see
to
the
swords
with
his
lordship
friend
with
a
relieved
look
the
major
went
forward
to
make
the
final
preparations
whilst
caryll
attended
by
wharton
rapidly
divested
himself
of
coat
and
waistcoat
then
kicked
off
his
light
shoes
and
stood
ready
a
slight
lithe
graceful
figure
in
white
holland
shirt
and
small
clothes
a
moment
later
the
adversaries
were
face
to
face
rotherby
divested
of
his
wig
and
with
a
kerchief
bound
about
his
head
all
a
trembling
eagerness
caryll
with
a
reluctance
lightly
masked
by
a
dangerous
composure
there
was
a
perfunctory
salute
a
mere
presenting
of
arms
and
the
blades
swept
round
in
a
to
their
first
meeting
but
rotherby
without
so
much
as
allowing
his
steel
to
touch
his
opponent
as
the
laws
of
courtesy
demanded
swirled
it
away
again
into
the
higher
lines
and
lunged
it
was
almost
like
a
foul
attempt
to
take
his
adversary
unawares
and
unprepared
and
for
a
second
it
looked
as
if
it
must
succeed
it
must
have
succeeded
but
for
the
miraculous
quickness
of
caryll
swinging
round
on
the
ball
of
his
right
foot
lightly
and
gracefully
as
a
dancing
master
and
with
no
sign
of
haste
or
fear
in
his
amazing
speed
he
let
the
other
blade
glance
past
him
to
meet
nothing
but
the
empty
air
as
a
result
by
the
very
force
of
the
stroke
rotherby
found
himself
and
carried
beyond
his
point
of
aim
while
sideward
movement
brought
him
not
only
nearer
his
opponent
but
entirely
within
his
guard
it
was
seen
by
them
all
and
by
none
with
such
panic
as
rotherby
himself
that
as
a
consequence
of
his
stroke
the
viscount
was
thrown
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
his
opponent
thus
at
the
very
outset
of
the
encounter
before
their
blades
had
so
much
as
touched
each
other
a
straightening
of
the
arm
on
the
part
of
caryll
and
the
engagement
would
have
been
at
an
end
caryll
however
did
not
straighten
his
arm
he
was
observed
to
smile
as
he
broke
ground
and
waited
for
his
lordship
to
recover
falgate
turned
pale
mainwaring
swore
softly
under
his
breath
in
fear
for
his
principal
gascoigne
did
the
same
in
vexation
at
the
opportunity
caryll
had
so
wantonly
wasted
wharton
looked
on
with
lips
and
wondered
rotherby
recovered
and
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
apart
seeming
to
feel
each
other
with
their
eyes
before
resuming
then
his
lordship
renewed
the
attack
with
vigor
caryll
parried
lightly
and
closely
plying
a
beautiful
weapon
in
the
best
manner
of
the
french
school
and
opposing
to
the
ponderous
force
of
his
antagonist
a
delicate
frustrating
science
rotherby
a
fine
swordsman
in
his
way
soon
saw
that
here
was
need
for
all
his
skill
and
he
exerted
it
but
the
prodigious
rapidity
of
his
blade
broke
as
upon
a
cuirass
against
the
other
light
impenetrable
guard
his
lordship
broke
ground
breathed
heavily
and
sweated
under
the
glare
of
the
morning
sun
cursing
this
swordsman
who
so
cool
and
deliberate
husbanded
his
strength
and
scarcely
seemed
to
move
yet
by
sheer
skill
and
address
more
than
neutralized
his
lordship
advantages
of
greater
strength
and
length
of
reach
you
cursed
french
dog
swore
the
viscount
presently
between
his
teeth
and
as
he
spoke
he
made
a
ringing
parade
feinted
beat
the
ground
with
his
foot
to
draw
off
the
other
attention
and
went
in
again
with
a
lunge
parry
that
you
damned
he
roared
caryll
answered
nothing
he
parried
parried
again
delivered
a
riposte
whenever
the
opportunity
offered
or
whenever
his
lordship
grew
too
pressing
and
it
became
expedient
to
drive
him
back
but
never
once
did
he
stretch
out
to
lunge
in
his
turn
the
seconds
were
so
lost
in
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
this
close
play
of
his
that
they
paid
no
heed
to
what
was
taking
place
in
the
square
about
them
they
never
observed
the
opening
windows
and
the
spectators
gathering
at
them
as
wharton
had
feared
amongst
these
had
either
of
the
combatants
looked
up
he
would
have
seen
his
own
father
on
the
balcony
of
stretton
house
a
moment
the
earl
stood
there
lady
ostermore
at
his
side
then
he
vanished
into
the
house
again
to
reappear
almost
at
once
in
the
street
with
a
couple
of
footmen
hurrying
after
him
meanwhile
the
combat
went
on
once
lord
rotherby
had
attempted
to
fall
back
for
a
respite
realizing
that
he
was
winded
but
caryll
denied
him
this
attacking
now
for
the
first
time
and
the
rapidity
of
his
play
was
such
that
rotherby
opined
the
end
to
be
at
hand
appreciated
to
the
full
his
peril
in
a
last
desperate
effort
gathering
up
what
shreds
of
strength
remained
him
he
repulsed
caryll
by
a
vigorous
counter
attack
he
saw
an
opening
feinted
to
enlarge
it
and
drove
in
quickly
throwing
his
last
ounce
of
strength
into
the
effort
this
time
it
could
not
be
said
to
have
been
parried
something
else
happened
his
blade
coming
foible
on
forte
against
caryll
was
suddenly
enveloped
it
was
as
if
a
tentacle
had
been
thrust
out
to
seize
it
for
the
barest
fraction
of
a
second
was
it
held
so
by
caryll
sword
then
easily
but
irresistibly
it
was
lifted
out
of
rotherby
hand
and
dropped
on
the
turf
a
or
so
from
his
lordship
stockinged
feet
a
cold
sweat
of
terror
broke
upon
him
he
caught
his
breath
with
a
sob
of
fear
his
eyes
dilating
wildly
for
point
was
coming
straight
as
an
arrow
at
his
throat
on
it
came
and
on
until
it
was
within
perhaps
three
inches
of
the
flesh
there
it
was
suddenly
arrested
and
for
a
long
moment
it
was
held
there
poised
death
itself
menacing
and
imminent
and
lord
rotherby
not
daring
to
move
rooted
where
he
stood
looked
with
fascinated
eyes
along
that
shimmering
blade
into
two
gleaming
eyes
behind
it
that
seemed
to
watch
him
with
a
solemnity
that
was
grim
to
the
point
of
mockery
time
and
the
world
stood
still
or
were
annihilated
in
that
moment
for
the
man
who
waited
high
in
the
blue
overhead
a
lark
was
pouring
out
its
song
but
his
lordship
heard
it
not
he
heard
nothing
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
that
gleaming
sword
and
those
gleaming
eyes
behind
it
then
a
voice
the
voice
of
his
antagonist
broke
the
silence
is
more
needed
it
asked
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
caryll
lowered
his
blade
and
drew
himself
upright
let
this
suffice
he
said
to
take
your
life
would
be
to
deprive
you
of
the
means
of
profiting
by
this
it
seemed
to
rotherby
as
if
he
were
awaking
from
a
trance
the
world
resumed
its
way
he
breathed
again
and
straightened
himself
too
from
the
arrested
attitude
of
his
last
lunge
rage
welled
up
from
his
black
soul
a
crimson
flood
swept
into
his
pallid
cheeks
his
eyes
rolled
and
blazed
with
the
fury
of
the
mad
caryll
moved
away
in
that
quiet
voice
of
his
take
up
your
sword
he
said
to
the
vanquished
over
his
shoulder
wharton
and
gascoigne
moved
towards
him
without
words
to
express
the
amazement
that
still
held
rotherby
glared
an
instant
longer
without
moving
then
doing
as
caryll
had
bidden
him
he
stooped
to
recover
his
blade
a
moment
he
held
it
looking
after
his
departing
adversary
then
with
swift
silent
stealth
he
sprang
to
follow
his
fell
intent
was
written
on
his
face
falgate
gasped
a
helpless
fool
while
mainwaring
hurled
himself
forward
to
prevent
the
thing
he
saw
impended
too
late
even
as
he
flung
out
his
hands
to
grapple
with
his
lordship
rotherby
arm
drove
straight
before
him
and
sent
his
sword
through
the
undefended
back
of
caryll
all
that
caryll
realized
at
first
was
that
he
had
been
struck
a
blow
between
the
shoulder
blades
and
then
ere
he
could
turn
to
inquire
into
the
cause
he
was
amazed
to
see
some
three
inches
of
steel
come
through
his
shirt
in
front
the
next
instant
an
exquisite
burning
searing
pain
went
through
and
through
him
as
the
blade
was
being
withdrawn
he
coughed
and
swayed
then
hurtled
sideways
into
the
arms
of
major
gascoigne
his
senses
swam
the
turf
heaved
and
rolled
as
if
an
earthquake
moved
it
the
houses
fronting
the
square
and
the
trees
immediately
before
him
leaped
and
danced
as
if
suddenly
launched
into
grotesque
animation
while
about
him
swirled
a
wild
incoherent
noise
of
voices
rising
and
falling
now
loud
now
silent
and
reaching
him
through
a
murmuring
hum
that
surged
about
his
ears
until
it
shut
out
all
else
and
consciousness
deserted
him
around
him
meanwhile
a
wild
scene
was
toward
his
grace
of
wharton
had
wrenched
away
the
sword
from
rotherby
and
mastered
by
an
effort
his
own
impulse
to
use
it
upon
the
murderer
captain
mainwaring
rotherby
own
second
a
man
of
quick
fierce
passions
utterly
unable
to
control
himself
fell
upon
his
lordship
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
with
his
hands
cursing
him
and
heaping
abuse
upon
him
with
every
blow
whilst
delicate
falgate
in
the
background
sick
to
the
point
of
faintness
stood
dabbing
his
lips
with
his
handkerchief
and
swearing
that
he
would
rot
before
he
allowed
himself
again
to
be
dragged
into
an
affair
of
honor
ye
damned
cutthroat
swore
the
militia
captain
standing
over
the
man
he
had
felled
d
know
what
be
the
fruits
of
this
ye
swing
at
tyburn
like
the
dirty
thief
y
are
god
help
me
i
give
a
hundred
guineas
sooner
than
be
mixed
in
this
filthy
is
no
matter
for
that
now
said
the
duke
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
and
drawing
him
away
from
his
lordship
get
up
heavily
mechanically
rotherby
got
to
his
feet
now
that
the
fit
of
rage
was
over
he
was
himself
all
stricken
at
the
thing
he
had
done
he
looked
at
the
limp
figure
on
the
turf
huddled
against
the
knee
of
major
gascoigne
looked
at
the
white
face
the
closed
eyes
and
the
stain
of
blood
oozing
farther
and
farther
across
the
holland
shirt
and
as
white
himself
as
the
stricken
man
he
shuddered
and
his
mouth
was
drawn
wide
with
horror
but
pitiful
though
he
looked
he
inspired
no
pity
in
the
duke
of
wharton
who
considered
him
with
an
eye
of
unspeakable
severity
if
caryll
dies
said
he
coldly
i
shall
see
to
it
that
you
hang
my
lord
i
not
rest
until
i
bring
you
to
the
and
then
before
more
could
be
said
there
came
a
sound
of
running
steps
and
labored
breathing
and
his
grace
swore
softly
to
himself
as
he
beheld
no
other
than
lord
ostermore
advancing
rapidly
all
out
of
breath
and
apoplectic
of
face
a
couple
of
footmen
pressing
close
upon
his
heels
and
behind
these
a
score
of
sightseers
who
had
followed
them
what
here
cried
the
earl
without
glancing
at
his
son
is
he
dead
is
he
dead
gascoigne
who
was
busily
endeavoring
to
stanch
the
bleeding
answered
without
looking
up
it
is
in
god
hands
i
think
he
is
very
like
to
ostermore
swung
round
upon
rotherby
he
had
paled
suddenly
and
his
mouth
trembled
he
raised
his
clenched
hand
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
about
to
strike
his
son
then
he
let
it
fall
again
you
villain
he
panted
breathless
from
running
and
from
rage
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
all
it
was
murder
and
as
god
my
life
if
caryll
dies
i
shall
see
to
it
that
you
hang
i
your
own
thus
assailed
on
every
side
some
of
the
cowering
shrinking
manner
left
the
viscount
his
antagonism
to
his
father
spurred
him
to
a
prouder
carriage
he
shrugged
indifferently
so
be
it
he
said
i
have
been
told
that
already
i
do
greatly
mainwaring
who
had
been
stooping
over
caryll
and
who
had
perhaps
more
knowledge
of
wounds
than
any
present
shook
his
head
ominously
be
dangerous
to
move
him
far
said
he
increase
the
my
men
shall
carry
him
across
to
stretton
house
said
lord
ostermore
lend
a
hand
here
you
gaping
the
footmen
advanced
the
crowd
which
was
growing
rapidly
and
was
watching
almost
in
silence
awed
pressed
as
close
as
it
dared
upon
these
gentlemen
mainwaring
procured
a
couple
of
cloaks
and
improvised
a
stretcher
with
them
of
this
he
took
one
corner
himself
gascoigne
another
and
the
footmen
the
remaining
two
thus
as
gently
as
might
be
they
bore
the
wounded
man
from
the
enclosure
through
the
crowd
that
had
by
now
assembled
in
the
street
and
over
the
threshold
of
stretton
house
a
groom
had
been
dispatched
for
a
doctor
and
his
grace
of
wharton
had
compelled
rotherby
to
accompany
them
into
his
father
house
sternly
threatening
to
hand
him
over
to
a
constable
at
once
if
he
refused
within
the
cool
hall
of
stretton
house
they
were
met
by
her
ladyship
and
mistress
winthrop
both
pale
but
the
eyes
of
each
wearing
a
vastly
different
expression
what
this
demanded
her
ladyship
as
they
trooped
in
why
do
you
bring
him
here
because
madam
answered
ostermore
in
a
voice
as
hard
as
iron
it
imports
to
save
his
life
for
if
he
dies
your
son
dies
as
surely
and
on
the
her
ladyship
staggered
and
flung
a
hand
to
her
breast
but
her
recovery
was
almost
immediate
was
a
duel
she
began
stoutly
was
murder
his
lordship
corrected
interrupting
murder
as
any
of
these
gentlemen
can
and
will
bear
witness
rotherby
ran
caryll
through
the
back
after
caryll
had
spared
his
is
a
lie
screamed
her
ladyship
her
lips
ashen
she
turned
to
rotherby
who
stood
there
in
shirt
and
breeches
and
shoeless
as
he
had
fought
why
do
you
say
that
it
is
a
lie
she
demanded
rotherby
endeavored
to
master
himself
madam
he
said
here
is
no
place
for
but
is
it
true
is
it
true
what
is
being
said
he
from
her
with
a
despairing
movement
and
caught
the
sharp
hiss
of
her
indrawn
breath
then
she
swept
past
him
to
the
side
of
the
wounded
man
who
had
been
laid
on
a
settle
what
is
his
hurt
she
inquired
wildly
looking
about
her
but
no
one
spoke
tragedy
more
far
than
the
tragedy
of
that
man
possible
death
was
in
the
air
and
struck
them
all
silent
will
no
one
answer
me
she
insisted
is
it
mortal
is
it
his
grace
of
wharton
turned
to
her
with
an
unusual
gravity
in
his
blue
eyes
we
hope
not
he
said
but
it
is
as
god
her
limbs
seemed
to
fail
her
and
she
sank
down
on
her
knees
beside
the
settle
we
must
save
him
she
muttered
fearfully
we
must
save
his
life
where
is
the
doctor
he
wo
die
oh
he
must
not
die
they
stood
grouped
about
looking
on
in
silence
rotherby
in
the
background
behind
him
again
on
the
topmost
of
the
three
steps
that
led
up
into
the
inner
hall
stood
mistress
winthrop
white
of
face
a
wild
horror
in
the
eyes
she
riveted
upon
the
wounded
and
unconscious
man
she
realized
that
he
was
like
to
die
there
was
an
infinite
pity
in
her
soul
and
maybe
something
more
her
impulse
was
to
go
to
him
her
every
instinct
urged
her
but
her
reason
held
her
back
then
as
she
looked
she
saw
with
a
feeling
almost
of
terror
that
his
eyes
were
suddenly
wide
open
wha
what
came
in
feeble
accents
from
his
lips
there
was
a
stir
about
him
never
move
justin
said
gascoigne
who
stood
by
his
head
you
are
hurt
lie
still
the
doctor
has
been
ah
it
was
a
sigh
the
wounded
man
closed
his
eyes
a
moment
then
them
i
remember
i
remember
he
said
feebly
it
is
it
is
grave
he
inquired
it
went
right
through
me
i
remember
he
surveyed
himself
there
been
a
deal
of
blood
lost
i
am
like
to
die
i
take
nay
sir
we
hope
not
we
hope
not
it
was
the
countess
who
spoke
a
wry
smile
twisted
his
lips
your
ladyship
is
very
good
said
he
i
had
not
thought
you
quite
so
much
my
i
i
have
done
you
a
wrong
he
paused
for
breath
and
it
was
not
plain
whether
he
spoke
in
sincerity
or
in
sarcasm
then
with
a
startling
suddenness
he
broke
into
a
soft
laugh
and
to
those
risen
who
could
not
think
what
had
occasioned
it
it
sounded
more
dreadful
than
any
plaint
he
could
have
uttered
he
had
bethought
him
that
there
was
no
longer
the
need
for
him
to
come
to
a
decision
in
the
matter
that
had
brought
him
to
england
and
his
laugh
was
almost
of
relief
the
riddle
he
could
never
have
solved
for
himself
in
a
manner
that
had
not
shattered
his
future
peace
of
mind
was
solved
and
well
solved
if
this
were
death
where
where
is
rotherby
he
inquired
presently
there
was
a
stir
and
men
drew
back
leaving
an
open
lane
to
the
place
where
rotherby
stood
caryll
saw
him
and
smiled
and
his
smile
held
no
tinge
of
mockery
you
are
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
rotherby
he
startled
all
by
saying
let
him
approach
he
begged
rotherby
came
forward
like
one
who
walks
in
his
sleep
i
am
sorry
he
said
thickly
cursed
there
scarce
the
need
said
caryll
lift
me
up
tom
he
begged
gascoigne
there
scarce
the
need
you
have
cleared
up
something
that
was
plaguing
me
my
lord
i
am
your
debtor
for
for
that
it
disposes
of
something
i
could
never
have
disposed
of
had
i
he
turned
to
the
duke
of
wharton
it
was
an
accident
he
said
significantly
you
all
saw
that
it
was
an
a
denial
rang
out
it
was
no
accident
cried
lord
ostermore
and
swore
an
oath
we
all
saw
what
it
then
your
eyes
deceived
you
it
was
an
accident
i
say
and
who
should
know
better
than
i
he
was
smiling
in
that
whimsical
enigmatic
way
of
his
smiling
still
he
sank
back
into
gascoigne
arms
you
are
talking
too
much
said
the
major
what
odds
i
am
not
like
to
talk
much
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
gentleman
in
black
wearing
a
grizzle
wig
and
carrying
a
cane
men
moved
aside
to
allow
him
to
approach
caryll
the
latter
not
noticing
him
had
met
at
last
the
gaze
of
hortensia
eyes
he
continued
to
smile
but
his
smile
was
now
changed
to
wistfulness
under
that
pitiful
regard
of
hers
it
is
better
so
he
was
saying
better
so
his
glance
was
upon
her
and
she
understood
what
none
other
there
suspected
that
those
words
were
for
her
alone
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swooned
again
as
the
doctor
stooped
to
remove
the
temporary
bandages
from
his
wound
hortensia
a
sob
beating
in
her
throat
turned
and
fled
to
her
own
room
chapter
xii
sunshine
and
shadow
caryll
was
almost
happy
he
reclined
on
a
long
chair
supported
by
pillows
cunningly
set
for
him
by
the
deft
hands
of
leduc
and
took
his
ease
and
indulged
his
in
lord
ostermore
garden
he
sat
within
the
cool
fragrant
shade
of
a
privet
arbor
interlaced
with
flowering
lilac
and
laburnum
and
he
looked
out
upon
the
long
sweep
of
emerald
lawn
and
the
little
patch
of
ornamental
water
where
the
gaped
their
ivory
chalices
to
the
morning
sun
he
looked
thinner
paler
and
more
frail
than
was
his
habit
which
is
not
wonderful
considering
that
he
had
been
four
weeks
abed
while
his
wound
was
mending
he
was
dressed
again
by
the
hands
of
the
incomparable
leduc
in
a
deshabille
of
some
artistry
a
of
flowered
satin
fell
open
at
the
waist
disclosing
breeches
and
stockings
elegant
shoes
of
spanish
leather
with
red
heels
and
diamond
buckles
his
chestnut
hair
had
been
dressed
with
as
great
care
as
though
he
were
attending
a
levee
and
leduc
had
insisted
upon
placing
a
small
round
patch
under
his
left
eye
that
it
might
said
leduc
impart
vivacity
to
a
countenance
that
looked
from
his
long
confinement
he
reclined
there
and
as
i
have
said
was
almost
happy
the
creature
of
sunshine
that
was
himself
at
heart
had
broken
through
the
heavy
clouds
that
had
been
obscuring
him
an
oppressive
burden
was
lifted
from
his
mind
and
conscience
that
through
the
back
a
month
ago
had
been
guided
he
opined
by
the
hand
of
a
befriending
providence
for
although
he
had
as
you
see
survived
it
it
had
none
the
less
solved
for
him
that
hateful
problem
he
could
never
have
solved
for
himself
that
problem
whose
solution
no
matter
which
alternative
he
had
adopted
must
have
brought
him
untold
misery
afterwards
as
it
was
during
the
weeks
that
he
had
lain
helpless
his
life
attached
to
him
by
but
the
merest
thread
the
chance
of
betraying
lord
ostermore
was
gone
nor
the
circumstances
being
such
as
they
were
could
sir
richard
everard
blame
him
that
he
had
let
it
pass
thus
he
knew
peace
knew
it
as
only
those
know
it
who
have
sustained
unrest
and
can
appreciate
relief
from
it
nature
had
made
him
a
voluptuary
and
reclining
there
in
an
ease
which
the
languor
born
of
his
long
illness
rendered
the
more
delicious
inhaling
the
tepid
summer
air
that
came
to
him
laden
with
a
most
sweet
attar
from
the
flowering
he
realized
that
with
all
its
cares
life
may
be
sweet
to
live
in
youth
and
in
the
month
of
june
he
sighed
and
smiled
pensively
at
the
nor
was
his
happiness
entirely
and
solely
the
essence
of
his
material
ease
this
was
his
third
morning
out
of
doors
and
on
each
of
the
two
mornings
that
were
gone
hortensia
had
borne
him
company
coming
with
the
charitable
intent
of
lightening
his
tedium
by
reading
to
him
but
remaining
to
talk
instead
the
most
perfect
friendliness
had
prevailed
between
them
a
camaraderie
which
caryll
had
been
careful
not
to
dispel
by
any
return
to
such
speeches
as
those
which
had
originally
offended
but
which
seemed
now
mercifully
forgotten
he
was
awaiting
her
and
his
expectancy
heightened
for
him
the
glory
of
the
morning
increased
the
meed
of
happiness
that
was
his
but
there
was
more
besides
leduc
who
stood
slightly
behind
him
fussily
busy
about
a
little
table
on
which
were
books
and
cordials
flowers
and
comfits
a
pipe
and
a
had
just
informed
him
for
the
first
time
that
during
the
more
dangerous
period
of
his
illness
mistress
winthrop
had
watched
by
his
bedside
for
many
hours
together
upon
many
occasions
and
once
on
the
day
after
he
had
been
wounded
and
while
his
fever
was
at
its
height
leduc
entering
suddenly
and
quietly
had
surprised
her
in
tears
all
this
was
most
sweet
news
to
caryll
he
found
that
between
himself
and
his
there
lay
an
even
deeper
debt
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
and
already
acknowledged
in
the
delicious
contemplation
of
hortensia
in
tears
beside
him
stricken
all
but
to
the
point
of
death
he
forgot
entirely
his
erstwhile
scruples
that
being
nameless
he
had
no
name
to
offer
her
in
imagination
he
conjured
up
the
scene
it
made
he
found
a
very
pretty
picture
he
would
smoke
upon
it
leduc
if
you
were
to
fill
me
a
pipe
of
spanish
monsieur
has
smoked
one
pipe
already
leduc
reminded
him
you
are
inconsequent
leduc
it
is
a
sign
of
advancing
age
repress
it
the
pipe
and
he
flicked
impatient
fingers
monsieur
is
forgetting
that
the
doctor
the
devil
take
the
doctor
said
caryll
with
finality
parfaitement
answered
the
smooth
leduc
over
the
bridge
we
laugh
at
the
saint
now
that
we
are
cured
the
devil
take
the
doctor
by
all
a
ripple
of
laughter
came
to
applaud
leduc
excursion
into
irony
the
arbor
had
another
narrower
entrance
on
the
left
hortensia
had
approached
this
all
unheard
on
the
soft
turf
and
stood
there
now
a
heavenly
apparition
in
white
flimsy
garments
head
slightly
eyes
mocking
lips
laughing
a
heavy
curl
of
her
dark
hair
falling
caressingly
into
the
hollow
where
white
neck
sprang
from
whiter
shoulder
you
make
too
rapid
a
recovery
sir
said
she
it
comes
of
learning
how
well
i
have
been
nursed
he
answered
making
shift
to
rise
and
he
laughed
inwardly
to
see
the
red
flush
of
confusion
spread
over
the
skin
the
reproachful
shaft
her
eyes
let
loose
upon
leduc
she
came
forward
swiftly
to
check
his
rising
but
he
was
already
on
his
feet
proud
of
his
return
to
strength
vain
to
display
it
nay
she
reproved
him
if
you
are
so
headstrong
i
shall
leave
if
you
do
i
vow
here
as
i
am
i
hope
a
gentleman
that
i
shall
go
home
and
on
you
would
kill
yourself
she
told
him
i
might
kill
myself
for
less
and
yet
be
she
looked
her
despair
of
him
what
must
i
do
to
make
you
reasonable
set
me
the
example
by
being
reasonable
yourself
and
let
there
be
no
more
of
this
wild
talk
of
leaving
me
the
very
moment
you
are
come
leduc
a
chair
for
mistress
winthrop
he
commanded
as
though
chairs
abounded
in
a
garden
nook
but
leduc
the
diplomat
had
effaced
himself
she
laughed
at
his
grand
air
and
herself
drew
forward
the
stool
that
had
been
leduc
and
sat
down
satisfied
caryll
made
her
a
bow
and
seated
himself
sideways
on
his
long
chair
so
that
he
faced
her
she
begged
that
he
would
dispose
himself
more
comfortably
but
he
scorned
the
very
notion
unaided
i
walked
here
from
the
house
he
informed
her
with
a
boastful
air
i
had
need
to
begin
to
feel
my
feet
again
you
are
pampering
me
here
and
to
pamper
an
invalid
is
bad
it
keeps
him
an
invalid
now
i
am
an
invalid
no
but
the
doctor
she
began
the
doctor
is
disposed
of
already
he
assured
her
very
definitely
disposed
of
ask
leduc
he
will
tell
not
a
doubt
of
that
she
answered
leduc
talks
too
you
have
a
spite
against
him
for
the
information
he
gave
me
on
the
score
of
how
and
by
whom
i
was
nursed
so
have
i
because
he
did
not
tell
me
before
and
because
when
he
told
me
he
would
not
tell
me
enough
he
has
no
eyes
this
leduc
he
is
a
dolt
who
only
sees
the
half
of
what
happens
and
only
remembers
the
half
of
what
he
has
i
am
sure
of
it
said
she
he
looked
surprised
an
instant
then
he
laughed
i
am
glad
that
we
but
you
have
yet
to
learn
the
cause
had
this
leduc
used
his
eyes
or
his
ears
to
better
purpose
he
had
been
able
to
tell
you
something
of
the
extent
to
which
i
am
in
your
ah
said
he
mystified
then
the
news
will
be
none
the
less
welcome
from
your
lips
said
he
is
it
that
you
are
interested
in
the
ravings
of
delirium
and
welcomed
the
opportunity
of
observing
them
at
first
hand
i
hope
i
raved
engagingly
if
so
be
that
i
did
rave
would
it
perchance
be
of
a
lady
that
i
talked
in
my
fevered
wanderings
of
a
lady
pale
as
a
lenten
rose
with
soft
brown
eyes
and
lips
that
your
guesses
are
all
wild
she
checked
him
my
debt
is
of
a
more
real
kind
it
concerns
my
my
fan
me
ye
winds
he
ejaculated
those
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
town
had
made
my
name
a
she
explained
in
a
low
tense
voice
her
eyelids
lowered
my
foolishness
in
running
off
with
my
lord
rotherby
that
i
might
at
all
cost
escape
the
tyranny
of
my
lady
ostermore
caryll
eyelids
flickered
suddenly
at
that
explanation
had
made
me
a
butt
and
a
jest
and
an
object
for
slander
you
remember
yourself
sir
the
sneers
and
oglings
the
starings
and
simperings
in
the
park
that
day
when
you
made
your
first
attempt
to
champion
my
cause
inducing
the
lady
mary
deller
to
come
and
speak
to
nay
nay
think
of
these
things
no
more
gnats
will
sting
is
in
their
nature
i
admit
is
very
vexing
at
the
time
but
it
soon
wears
off
if
the
flesh
they
have
stung
be
healthy
so
think
no
more
but
you
do
not
know
what
follows
her
ladyship
insisted
that
i
should
drive
with
her
a
week
after
your
hurt
when
the
doctor
first
proclaimed
you
out
of
danger
and
while
the
town
was
still
all
agog
with
the
affair
no
doubt
her
ladyship
thought
to
put
a
fresh
and
greater
humiliation
upon
me
you
would
not
be
present
to
blunt
the
edge
of
the
insult
of
those
creatures
glances
she
carried
me
to
vauxhall
where
a
fuller
scope
might
be
given
to
the
pursuit
of
my
shame
and
mortification
instead
what
think
you
happened
her
ladyship
i
trust
was
the
word
is
too
poor
to
describe
her
condition
she
broke
a
fan
beat
her
black
boy
and
dismissed
a
footman
that
she
might
vent
some
of
the
spleen
it
moved
in
her
never
was
such
respect
never
such
homage
shown
to
any
woman
as
was
shown
to
me
that
evening
we
were
all
but
mobbed
by
the
very
people
who
had
earlier
slighted
me
was
all
so
mysterious
that
i
must
seek
the
explanation
of
it
and
i
had
it
at
length
from
his
grace
of
wharton
who
was
at
my
side
for
most
of
the
time
we
walked
in
the
gardens
i
asked
him
frankly
to
what
was
this
change
owing
and
he
told
me
she
looked
at
him
as
though
no
more
need
be
said
but
his
brows
were
knit
he
told
you
he
questioned
he
told
you
what
what
you
had
done
at
white
how
to
all
present
and
to
my
lord
rotherby
own
face
you
had
related
the
true
story
of
what
befell
at
maidstone
how
i
had
gone
thither
an
innocent
foolish
maid
to
be
married
to
a
villain
whom
like
the
silly
child
i
was
i
thought
i
loved
how
that
villain
taking
advantage
of
my
innocence
and
ignorance
intended
to
hoodwink
me
with
a
that
was
the
story
that
was
on
every
lip
it
had
gone
round
the
town
like
fire
and
it
says
much
for
the
town
that
what
between
that
and
the
foul
business
of
the
duel
my
lord
rotherby
was
receiving
on
every
hand
the
condemnation
he
deserves
while
for
me
there
was
once
more
and
with
heavy
interest
for
the
lapse
from
it
the
respect
which
my
indiscretion
had
forfeited
and
which
would
have
continued
to
be
denied
me
but
for
your
noble
championing
of
my
cause
that
sir
is
the
extent
to
which
i
am
in
your
debt
do
you
think
it
small
it
is
so
great
that
i
have
no
words
in
which
to
attempt
to
express
my
caryll
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
eyes
that
were
very
bright
then
he
broke
into
a
soft
laugh
that
had
a
note
of
slyness
in
my
time
said
he
i
have
seen
many
attempts
to
change
an
inconvenient
topic
some
have
been
artful
others
artless
others
utterly
clumsy
but
this
i
think
is
the
clumsiest
of
them
all
mistress
winthrop
is
not
worthy
in
she
looked
puzzled
intrigued
by
his
mood
mistress
winthrop
he
resumed
with
an
entire
change
of
voice
to
speak
of
this
trifle
is
but
a
subterfuge
of
yours
to
prevent
me
from
expressing
my
deep
gratitude
for
your
care
of
indeed
no
she
began
indeed
yes
said
he
how
can
this
compare
with
what
you
have
done
for
me
for
i
have
learnt
how
greatly
it
is
to
you
yourself
that
i
owe
my
recovery
the
saving
of
my
ah
but
that
is
not
true
it
let
me
think
so
whether
it
be
true
or
not
he
implored
her
eyes
between
tenderness
and
whimsicality
intent
upon
her
face
let
me
believe
it
for
the
belief
has
brought
me
happiness
the
greatest
happiness
i
think
that
i
have
ever
known
i
can
know
but
one
greater
and
that
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
she
observed
that
the
hand
he
had
stretched
out
trembled
a
moment
ere
it
was
abruptly
lowered
again
it
was
as
a
man
who
had
reached
forth
to
grasp
something
that
he
craves
and
checked
his
desire
upon
a
sudden
thought
she
felt
oddly
stirred
despite
herself
and
oddly
constrained
it
may
have
been
to
disguise
this
that
she
half
turned
to
the
table
saying
you
were
about
to
smoke
when
i
and
she
took
up
his
pipe
and
tobacco
jar
to
offer
them
ah
but
since
you
come
i
would
not
dream
he
said
she
looked
at
him
the
complete
change
of
topic
permitted
it
if
i
desired
you
so
to
do
she
inquired
and
added
i
love
the
fragrance
of
he
raised
his
brows
fragrance
quoth
he
my
lady
ostermore
has
another
word
for
he
took
the
pipe
and
jar
from
her
is
no
humoring
this
of
a
man
you
imagine
sick
no
silly
chivalry
of
yours
he
questioned
doubtfully
did
i
think
that
i
never
smoke
another
pipe
she
shook
her
head
and
laughed
at
his
solemnity
i
love
the
fragrance
she
repeated
ah
why
then
i
pleasure
you
said
he
with
the
air
of
one
conferring
favors
and
filled
his
pipe
presently
he
spoke
again
in
a
musing
tone
in
a
week
or
so
i
shall
be
well
enough
to
is
your
intent
to
travel
she
inquired
he
set
down
the
jar
and
reached
for
the
tinderbox
it
is
time
i
was
returning
home
he
explained
ah
yes
your
home
is
in
at
maligny
the
sweetest
nook
in
normandy
was
my
birthplace
and
was
there
she
you
have
felt
the
loss
of
her
i
make
no
that
might
have
been
the
case
if
i
had
known
her
answered
he
but
as
it
is
i
never
did
i
was
but
two
years
old
she
herself
but
twenty
when
she
he
pulled
at
his
pipe
in
silence
a
moment
or
two
his
face
overcast
and
thoughtful
a
shallower
woman
would
have
broken
in
with
expressions
of
regret
hortensia
offered
him
the
nobler
sympathy
of
silence
moreover
she
had
felt
from
his
tone
that
there
was
more
to
come
that
what
he
had
said
was
but
the
preface
to
some
story
that
he
desired
her
to
be
acquainted
with
and
presently
as
she
expected
he
continued
she
died
mistress
winthrop
of
a
broken
heart
my
father
had
abandoned
her
two
years
and
more
before
she
died
in
those
years
of
repining
ay
and
worse
of
actual
want
her
health
was
broken
so
that
poor
soul
she
o
pitiful
cried
hortensia
pain
in
her
face
pitiful
indeed
the
more
pitiful
that
her
death
was
a
source
of
some
slight
happiness
to
those
who
loved
her
the
only
happiness
they
could
have
in
her
was
to
know
that
she
was
at
and
and
your
father
i
am
coming
to
him
my
mother
had
a
friend
a
very
noble
gentleman
who
had
loved
her
with
a
great
and
honest
love
before
the
profligate
who
was
my
father
came
forward
as
a
suitor
recognizing
in
the
latter
as
he
thought
in
his
honest
heart
a
man
in
better
case
to
make
her
happy
this
gentleman
i
speak
of
went
his
ways
he
came
upon
her
afterwards
broken
and
abandoned
and
he
gathered
up
the
poor
shards
of
her
shattered
life
and
sought
with
tender
but
unavailing
hands
to
piece
them
together
again
and
when
she
died
he
vowed
to
stand
my
friend
and
to
make
up
to
me
for
the
want
i
had
of
parents
is
by
his
bounty
that
i
am
lord
of
maligny
that
was
for
generations
the
property
of
my
mother
people
is
by
his
bounty
and
loving
care
that
i
am
what
i
am
and
not
what
so
easily
i
might
have
become
had
the
seed
sown
by
my
father
been
allowed
to
put
out
he
paused
as
if
bethinking
himself
and
looked
at
her
with
a
wistful
inquiring
smile
but
why
plague
you
he
cried
with
this
poor
tale
of
yesterday
that
will
be
forgot
nay
ah
nay
she
begged
and
put
out
a
hand
in
impulsive
sympathy
to
touch
his
own
so
transparent
now
in
its
emaciation
tell
me
tell
me
his
smile
softened
he
sighed
gently
and
continued
this
gentleman
who
adopted
me
lived
for
one
single
purpose
with
one
single
aim
in
view
to
avenge
my
mother
whom
he
had
loved
upon
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
and
who
had
so
ill
repaid
her
he
reared
me
for
that
purpose
as
much
i
think
as
out
of
any
other
feeling
thirty
years
have
sped
and
still
the
hand
of
the
avenger
has
not
fallen
upon
my
father
it
should
have
fallen
a
month
ago
but
i
was
weak
i
hesitated
and
then
this
put
me
out
of
all
case
of
doing
what
i
had
crossed
from
france
to
she
looked
at
him
with
something
of
horror
in
her
face
were
you
were
you
to
have
been
the
instrument
she
inquired
were
you
to
have
avenged
this
thing
upon
your
own
father
he
nodded
slowly
was
to
that
end
that
i
was
reared
he
answered
and
put
aside
his
pipe
which
had
gone
out
the
spirit
of
revenge
was
educated
into
me
until
i
came
to
look
upon
revenge
as
the
best
and
holiest
of
emotions
until
i
believed
that
if
i
failed
to
wreak
it
i
must
be
a
craven
and
a
dastard
all
this
seemed
so
until
the
moment
came
to
set
my
hand
to
the
task
and
then
he
shrugged
and
then
she
questioned
i
could
the
full
horror
of
it
burst
upon
me
i
saw
the
thing
in
its
true
and
hideous
proportions
and
it
revolted
it
must
have
been
so
she
approved
him
i
told
my
but
i
met
with
neither
sympathy
nor
understanding
he
renewed
his
arguments
and
again
he
seemed
to
prove
to
me
that
did
i
fail
i
should
be
false
to
my
duty
and
to
my
mother
memory
a
weakling
a
thing
of
the
monster
oh
the
monster
he
is
an
evil
man
for
all
that
you
have
said
of
not
so
there
is
no
nobler
gentleman
in
all
the
world
i
who
know
him
know
that
it
is
through
the
very
nobility
of
it
that
this
warp
has
come
into
his
nature
sane
in
all
things
else
he
is
i
see
it
now
i
understand
it
at
last
insane
on
this
one
subject
much
brooding
has
made
him
mad
upon
this
matter
a
fanatic
whose
gospel
is
vengeance
and
like
all
fanatics
he
is
harsh
and
intolerant
when
resisted
on
the
point
of
his
fanaticism
this
is
something
i
have
come
to
realize
in
these
past
days
when
i
lay
with
naught
else
to
do
but
ponder
in
all
things
else
he
sees
as
deep
and
clear
as
any
man
in
this
his
vision
is
distorted
he
has
looked
at
nothing
else
for
thirty
years
can
you
wonder
that
his
sight
is
blurred
he
is
to
be
pitied
then
she
said
deeply
to
be
true
and
because
i
pitied
him
because
i
valued
his
mistaken
he
might
be
above
all
else
i
was
hesitating
again
this
time
between
my
duty
to
myself
and
my
duty
to
him
i
was
so
hesitating
though
i
scarce
can
doubt
which
had
prevailed
in
the
end
when
came
this
so
very
opportunely
to
put
me
out
of
case
of
doing
one
thing
or
the
but
now
that
you
are
well
again
she
asked
now
that
i
am
well
again
i
thank
heaven
that
it
will
be
too
late
the
opportunity
that
was
ours
is
lost
his
my
father
should
now
be
beyond
our
there
ensued
a
spell
of
silence
he
sat
with
eyes
averted
from
her
face
those
eyes
which
she
had
never
known
other
than
whimsical
and
mocking
now
full
of
gloom
and
pain
riveted
upon
the
glare
of
sunshine
on
the
pond
out
yonder
a
great
sympathy
welled
up
from
her
heart
for
this
man
whom
she
was
still
far
from
understanding
and
who
nevertheless
because
of
it
perhaps
for
there
is
much
fascination
in
that
which
puzzles
was
already
growing
very
dear
to
her
the
story
he
had
told
her
drew
her
infinitely
closer
to
him
softening
her
heart
for
him
even
more
perhaps
than
it
had
already
been
softened
when
she
had
seen
him
as
she
had
thought
upon
the
point
of
dying
a
wonder
flitted
through
her
mind
as
to
why
he
had
told
her
then
another
question
surged
she
gave
it
tongue
you
have
told
me
so
much
caryll
she
said
that
i
am
emboldened
to
ask
something
his
eyes
invited
her
to
put
her
question
your
your
father
was
he
related
to
lord
ostermore
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
why
that
he
asked
because
your
name
is
caryll
said
she
my
name
he
laughed
softly
and
bitterly
my
name
he
reached
for
an
ebony
cane
that
stood
beside
his
chair
i
had
thought
you
he
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
and
she
forgot
to
caution
him
against
exertion
i
have
no
right
to
any
name
he
told
her
my
father
was
a
man
too
full
of
worldly
affairs
to
think
of
trifles
and
so
it
befell
that
before
he
went
his
ways
he
forgot
to
marry
the
poor
lady
who
was
my
mother
i
might
take
what
name
i
chose
i
chose
caryll
but
you
will
understand
mistress
winthrop
and
he
looked
her
fully
in
the
face
attempting
in
vain
to
dissemble
the
agony
in
his
eyes
he
who
a
little
while
ago
had
been
almost
happy
that
if
ever
it
should
happen
that
i
should
come
to
love
a
woman
who
is
worthy
of
being
loved
i
who
am
nameless
have
no
name
to
offer
revelation
illumined
her
mind
as
in
a
flash
she
looked
at
him
was
was
that
what
you
meant
that
day
we
thought
you
dying
when
you
said
to
me
for
it
was
to
me
you
spoke
to
me
alone
that
it
was
better
so
he
inclined
his
head
that
is
what
i
meant
he
answered
her
lids
drooped
her
cheeks
were
very
white
and
he
remarked
the
swift
agitated
surge
of
her
bosom
the
fingers
that
were
plucking
at
one
another
in
her
lap
without
looking
up
she
spoke
again
if
you
had
the
love
to
offer
what
would
the
rest
matter
what
is
a
name
that
it
should
weigh
so
much
heyday
he
sighed
and
smiled
very
wistfully
you
are
young
child
in
time
you
will
understand
what
place
the
world
assigns
to
such
men
as
i
it
is
a
place
i
could
ask
no
woman
to
share
such
as
i
am
could
i
speak
of
love
to
any
woman
yet
you
spoke
of
love
once
to
me
she
reminded
him
scarcely
above
her
breath
and
stabbed
him
with
the
recollection
in
an
hour
of
moonshine
an
hour
of
madness
when
i
was
a
reckless
fool
that
must
give
tongue
to
every
impulse
you
reproved
me
then
in
just
the
terms
my
case
deserved
hortensia
he
bent
towards
her
leaning
on
his
cane
is
very
sweet
and
merciful
in
you
to
recall
it
without
reproach
recall
it
no
more
save
to
think
with
scorn
of
the
fleering
coxcomb
who
was
so
lost
to
the
respect
that
is
due
to
so
sweet
a
lady
i
have
told
you
so
much
of
myself
that
you
decidedly
came
a
shrill
ironical
voice
from
the
arbor
entrance
i
may
congratulate
you
sir
upon
the
prodigious
strides
of
your
caryll
straightened
himself
from
his
stooping
posture
turned
and
made
lady
ostermore
a
bow
his
whole
manner
changed
again
to
that
which
was
habitual
to
him
and
no
less
decidedly
my
lady
said
he
with
a
smile
may
i
congratulate
your
ladyship
son
upon
that
happy
circumstance
which
is
as
i
have
learned
so
greatly
due
to
the
steps
your
ladyship
took
for
which
i
shall
be
ever
grateful
to
ensure
that
i
should
be
made
whole
chapter
xiii
the
forlorn
hope
her
ladyship
stood
a
moment
leaning
upon
her
cane
her
head
thrown
back
her
thin
lip
curling
and
her
eyes
playing
over
caryll
with
a
look
of
dislike
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
dissemble
caryll
found
the
situation
redolent
with
comedy
he
had
a
quick
eye
for
such
matters
so
quick
an
eye
that
he
deplored
on
the
present
occasion
her
ladyship
entire
lack
of
a
sense
of
humor
but
for
that
lamentable
shortcoming
she
might
have
enjoyed
with
him
the
grotesqueness
of
her
having
she
who
disliked
him
so
exceedingly
toiled
and
anguished
robbed
herself
of
sleep
and
hoped
and
prayed
with
more
fervor
perhaps
than
she
had
ever
yet
hoped
and
prayed
for
anything
that
his
life
might
be
spared
her
glance
shifted
presently
from
him
to
hortensia
who
had
risen
and
who
stood
in
deep
confusion
at
having
been
so
found
by
her
ladyship
and
in
deep
agitation
still
arising
from
the
things
he
had
said
and
from
those
which
he
had
been
hindered
from
adding
by
the
coming
of
the
countess
the
explanations
that
had
been
interrupted
might
never
be
renewed
she
felt
they
never
would
be
he
would
account
that
he
had
said
enough
since
he
was
determined
to
ask
for
nothing
and
unless
the
matter
were
broached
again
what
chance
had
she
of
combatting
his
foolish
scruples
for
foolish
she
accounted
them
they
were
of
no
weight
with
her
unless
indeed
to
heighten
the
warm
feeling
that
already
she
had
conceived
for
him
her
ladyship
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
her
fan
going
gently
to
and
fro
stirring
the
barbs
of
the
white
plume
that
formed
part
of
her
tall
what
were
you
doing
here
child
she
inquired
very
coldly
mistress
winthrop
looked
up
a
sudden
almost
scared
glance
it
was
i
madam
why
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
and
seeing
caryll
here
i
came
to
ask
him
how
he
did
to
offer
to
read
to
him
if
he
would
have
and
the
maidstone
matter
not
yet
cold
in
its
grave
commented
her
ladyship
sourly
as
i
a
woman
it
is
monstrous
i
should
be
inflicted
with
the
care
of
you
that
have
no
care
for
hortensia
bit
her
lip
controlling
herself
bravely
a
spot
of
red
in
either
cheek
caryll
came
promptly
to
her
rescue
your
ladyship
must
confess
that
mistress
winthrop
has
assisted
nobly
in
the
care
of
me
and
so
has
placed
your
ladyship
in
her
in
my
debt
shrilled
the
countess
eyebrows
aloft
nodding
and
what
of
yours
in
my
clumsy
way
i
have
already
attempted
to
convey
my
thanks
to
her
it
might
be
graceful
in
your
ladyship
to
follow
my
mentally
caryll
observed
that
it
is
unwise
to
rouge
so
heavily
as
did
lady
ostermore
when
prone
to
anger
and
to
paling
under
it
the
false
color
looks
so
very
false
on
such
occasions
her
ladyship
struck
the
ground
with
her
cane
for
what
have
i
to
thank
her
sir
will
you
tell
me
that
you
who
seem
so
very
well
why
for
her
part
in
saving
your
son
life
if
you
must
have
it
heaven
knows
he
continued
in
his
characteristic
manner
under
which
it
was
so
difficult
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
real
feelings
i
am
not
one
to
throw
services
done
in
the
face
of
folk
but
here
have
mistress
winthrop
and
i
been
doing
our
best
for
your
son
in
this
matter
she
by
so
diligently
nursing
me
i
by
responding
to
her
nursing
and
your
ladyship
and
so
recovering
from
my
wound
i
do
not
think
that
your
ladyship
shows
us
a
becoming
gratitude
it
is
but
natural
that
we
in
your
ladyship
and
lord
interests
should
have
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
on
the
score
of
those
labors
which
have
made
us
her
ladyship
measured
him
with
a
malignant
eye
are
you
quite
mad
sir
she
asked
him
he
shrugged
and
smiled
it
has
been
alleged
against
me
on
occasion
but
i
think
it
was
pure
then
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
long
seat
that
stood
at
the
back
of
the
arbor
will
your
ladyship
not
sit
you
will
forgive
that
i
urge
it
in
my
own
interest
they
tell
me
that
it
is
not
good
for
me
to
stand
too
long
just
it
was
his
hope
that
she
would
depart
not
so
i
cry
you
mercy
said
she
acidly
and
rustled
to
the
bench
be
seated
she
continued
to
watch
them
with
her
baleful
glance
we
have
heard
fine
things
from
you
sir
of
what
you
have
both
done
for
my
lord
rotherby
she
gibed
mocking
him
with
the
spirit
of
his
shall
i
tell
you
more
precisely
what
is
he
owes
you
can
there
be
more
quoth
caryll
smiling
so
amiably
that
he
must
have
disarmed
a
gorgon
her
ladyship
ignored
him
he
owes
it
to
you
both
that
you
have
estranged
him
from
his
father
set
up
a
breach
between
them
that
is
never
like
to
be
healed
is
what
he
owes
does
he
not
owe
it
rather
to
his
abandoned
ways
asked
hortensia
in
a
calm
clear
voice
bravely
giving
back
her
ladyship
look
for
look
abandoned
ways
screamed
the
countess
you
that
speak
of
abandoned
ways
ye
shameless
baggage
faith
ye
may
be
some
judge
of
them
ye
fooled
him
into
running
off
with
you
was
that
began
all
this
just
as
with
your
airs
and
simpers
and
innocences
you
fooled
this
other
here
into
being
your
madam
you
insult
me
hortensia
was
on
her
feet
eyes
flashing
cheeks
aflame
i
am
witness
to
that
said
lord
ostermore
coming
in
through
the
caryll
was
the
only
one
who
had
seen
him
approach
the
earl
face
that
had
wont
to
be
so
florid
was
now
pale
and
careworn
and
he
seemed
to
have
lost
flesh
during
the
past
month
he
turned
to
her
ladyship
out
on
you
he
said
testily
to
chide
the
poor
child
so
poor
child
sneered
her
ladyship
eyes
raised
to
heaven
to
invoke
its
testimony
to
this
absurdity
poor
let
there
be
an
end
to
it
madam
he
said
with
attempted
sternness
it
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
if
it
were
that
which
it
is
not
it
would
be
but
following
the
example
that
you
set
me
what
are
you
but
unreasonable
and
unjust
to
treat
your
son
as
you
are
treating
him
his
lordship
crimsoned
on
the
subject
of
his
son
he
could
be
angry
in
earnest
even
with
her
ladyship
as
already
we
have
seen
i
have
no
son
he
declared
there
is
a
lewd
drunken
bullying
profligate
who
bears
my
name
and
who
will
be
lord
ostermore
some
day
i
ca
strip
him
of
that
but
i
strip
him
of
all
else
that
mine
god
helping
me
i
beg
my
lady
that
you
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
i
beg
it
lord
rotherby
leaves
my
house
now
that
caryll
is
restored
to
health
indeed
he
has
stayed
longer
than
was
necessary
he
leaves
he
has
my
orders
and
my
servants
have
orders
to
see
that
he
obeys
them
i
do
not
wish
to
see
him
again
never
let
him
go
and
let
him
be
thankful
and
be
your
ladyship
thankful
too
since
it
seems
you
must
have
a
kindness
for
him
in
spite
of
all
he
has
done
to
disgrace
and
discredit
us
that
he
goes
not
by
way
of
holborn
hill
and
she
looked
at
him
very
white
from
suppressed
fury
i
do
believe
you
had
been
glad
had
it
been
nay
he
answered
i
had
been
sorry
for
caryll
and
for
his
own
pshaw
are
you
a
father
she
wondered
contemptuously
to
my
eternal
shame
he
flung
back
at
her
he
seemed
indeed
a
changed
man
in
more
than
body
since
caryll
duel
with
lord
rotherby
no
more
no
more
he
cried
seeming
suddenly
to
remember
the
presence
of
caryll
who
sat
languidly
drawing
figures
on
the
ground
with
the
ferrule
of
his
cane
he
turned
to
ask
the
convalescent
how
he
did
her
ladyship
rose
to
withdraw
and
at
that
moment
leduc
made
his
appearance
with
a
salver
on
which
was
a
bowl
of
soup
a
flask
of
hock
and
a
letter
setting
this
down
in
such
a
manner
that
the
letter
was
immediately
under
his
master
eyes
he
further
proceeded
to
draw
caryll
attention
to
it
it
was
addressed
in
sir
richard
everard
hand
caryll
took
it
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
her
ladyship
eyebrows
went
up
will
you
not
read
your
letter
caryll
she
invited
him
with
an
amazingly
sudden
change
to
amiability
it
will
keep
to
while
away
an
hour
that
is
less
pleasantly
and
he
took
the
napkin
leduc
was
proffering
you
pay
your
correspondent
a
poor
compliment
said
she
my
correspondent
is
not
one
to
look
for
them
or
need
them
he
answered
lightly
and
dipped
his
spoon
in
the
broth
is
she
not
quoth
her
ladyship
caryll
laughed
so
feminine
said
he
ha
ha
so
very
feminine
to
assume
the
sex
so
is
an
easy
assumption
when
the
superscription
is
writ
in
a
caryll
the
picture
of
amiability
smiled
between
spoonfuls
your
ladyship
eyes
preserve
not
only
their
beauty
but
a
keenness
beyond
how
could
you
have
seen
it
from
that
distance
sylvia
inquired
his
practical
lordship
then
again
said
her
ladyship
ignoring
both
remarks
there
is
the
assiduity
of
this
fair
writer
since
caryll
has
been
in
case
to
receive
letters
five
billets
in
six
days
deny
it
if
you
can
her
playfulness
so
sat
more
awkwardly
upon
her
than
her
usual
and
more
overt
malice
towards
him
to
what
end
should
i
deny
it
he
replied
and
added
in
his
most
ingratiating
manner
another
of
his
compliments
your
ladyship
is
the
model
chatelaine
no
happening
in
your
household
can
escape
your
knowledge
his
lordship
is
greatly
to
be
yet
you
see
she
cried
appealing
to
her
husband
and
even
to
hortensia
who
sat
apart
scarce
heeding
this
trivial
matter
of
which
so
much
was
being
made
you
see
that
he
evades
the
point
avoids
a
direct
answer
to
the
question
that
is
since
your
ladyship
perceives
it
it
were
more
merciful
to
spare
my
invention
the
labor
of
fashioning
further
subterfuges
i
am
a
sick
man
still
and
my
wits
are
far
from
he
took
up
the
glass
of
wine
leduc
had
poured
for
him
the
countess
looked
at
him
again
through
narrowing
eyelids
the
playfulness
all
vanished
you
do
yourself
injustice
sir
as
i
am
a
woman
your
wits
want
nothing
more
in
she
rose
and
looked
down
upon
him
engrossed
in
his
broth
for
a
dissembler
sir
she
pronounced
upon
him
acidly
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
meet
your
he
dropped
his
spoon
into
the
bowl
with
a
clatter
he
looked
up
the
very
picture
of
amazement
and
consternation
a
dissembler
i
quoth
he
in
earnest
protest
then
laughed
and
quoted
adapting
is
not
my
talent
to
conceal
my
thoughts
or
carry
smiles
and
sunshine
in
my
face
should
discontent
sit
heavy
at
my
she
looked
him
over
pursing
her
lips
i
often
thought
you
might
have
been
a
player
said
she
contemptuously
he
laughed
i
sooner
play
than
ay
but
you
make
a
toil
of
play
compassionate
me
he
implored
in
the
best
of
humors
i
am
but
a
sick
man
your
ladyship
too
keen
for
she
moved
across
to
the
exit
without
answering
him
come
child
she
said
to
hortensia
we
are
tiring
caryll
i
fear
let
us
leave
him
to
his
letter
ere
it
sets
his
pocket
hortensia
rose
loath
though
she
might
be
to
depart
there
was
no
reason
she
could
urge
for
lingering
is
not
your
lordship
coming
said
she
of
course
he
is
her
ladyship
commanded
i
need
to
speak
with
you
yet
concerning
rotherby
she
informed
him
hem
his
lordship
coughed
plainly
he
was
not
at
his
ease
i
will
follow
soon
do
not
stay
for
me
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
will
it
not
keep
what
can
you
have
to
say
to
him
that
is
so
pressing
but
a
word
no
why
then
we
stay
for
you
said
her
ladyship
and
threw
him
into
confusion
hopeless
dissembler
that
he
was
nay
nay
i
beg
that
you
will
her
ladyship
brows
went
up
her
eyes
narrowed
again
and
a
frown
came
between
them
you
are
mighty
mysterious
said
she
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
and
bethinking
her
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
found
them
so
bethinking
her
too
jumping
to
rash
conclusions
that
in
this
mystery
that
linked
them
might
lie
the
true
secret
of
her
husband
aversion
to
his
son
and
of
his
oath
a
month
ago
to
see
that
same
son
hang
if
caryll
succumbed
to
the
wound
he
had
taken
with
some
women
to
suspect
a
thing
is
to
believe
that
thing
her
ladyship
was
of
these
she
set
too
high
value
upon
her
acumen
upon
the
keenness
of
her
instincts
and
if
aught
were
needed
to
cement
her
present
suspicions
caryll
himself
afforded
that
cement
by
seeming
to
betray
the
same
eagerness
to
be
alone
with
his
lordship
that
his
lordship
was
betraying
to
be
alone
with
him
though
in
truth
he
no
more
than
desired
to
lend
assistance
to
the
earl
out
of
curiosity
to
learn
what
it
was
his
lordship
might
have
to
say
indeed
said
he
if
you
could
give
his
lordship
leave
for
a
few
moments
i
should
myself
be
glad
come
hortensia
said
her
ladyship
shortly
and
swept
out
mistress
winthrop
following
in
silence
they
crossed
the
lawn
together
once
only
ere
they
reached
the
house
her
ladyship
looked
back
i
would
i
knew
what
they
are
plotting
she
said
through
her
teeth
plotting
echoed
hortensia
ay
plotting
simpleton
i
said
plotting
i
mind
me
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
seen
them
so
mysterious
together
it
began
on
the
day
that
first
caryll
set
foot
at
stretton
house
there
a
deal
of
mystery
about
that
man
too
much
for
honesty
and
then
these
letters
touching
which
he
is
so
close
one
a
day
and
his
french
lackey
always
at
hand
to
pounce
upon
them
the
moment
they
arrive
i
wonder
what
at
bottom
o
i
wonder
and
i
give
these
ears
to
know
she
snapped
in
conclusion
as
they
went
indoors
in
the
arbor
meanwhile
his
lordship
had
taken
the
rustic
seat
her
ladyship
had
vacated
he
sat
down
heavily
like
a
man
who
is
weary
in
body
and
in
mind
like
a
man
who
is
bearing
a
load
too
heavy
for
his
shoulders
caryll
watching
him
observed
all
this
a
glass
of
hock
he
suggested
waving
his
hand
towards
the
flask
let
me
play
host
to
you
out
of
the
contents
of
your
own
his
lordship
eye
brightened
at
the
suggestion
which
confirmed
the
impression
caryll
had
formed
that
all
was
far
from
well
with
his
lordship
leduc
brimmed
a
glass
and
handed
it
to
my
lord
who
emptied
it
at
a
draught
caryll
waved
an
impatient
hand
away
with
you
leduc
go
watch
the
goldfish
in
the
pond
i
call
you
if
i
need
after
leduc
had
departed
a
silence
fell
between
them
and
endured
some
moments
his
lordship
was
leaning
forward
elbows
on
knees
his
face
in
shadow
at
length
he
sat
back
and
looked
at
his
companion
across
the
little
intervening
space
i
have
hesitated
to
speak
to
you
before
caryll
upon
the
matter
that
you
know
of
lest
your
recovery
should
not
be
so
far
advanced
that
you
might
bear
the
strain
and
fatigue
of
conversing
upon
serious
topics
i
trust
that
that
cause
is
now
so
far
removed
that
i
may
put
aside
my
assuredly
i
am
glad
to
say
thanks
to
the
great
care
you
have
had
of
me
here
at
stretton
there
is
no
debt
between
us
on
that
score
answered
his
lordship
shortly
brusquely
almost
well
then
he
checked
and
looked
about
him
we
might
be
approached
without
hearing
any
one
he
said
caryll
smiled
and
shook
his
head
i
am
not
wont
to
neglect
such
details
he
observed
the
eyes
of
argus
were
not
so
vigilant
as
my
leduc
and
he
understands
that
we
are
private
he
will
give
us
warning
should
any
attempt
to
approach
be
assured
of
that
and
believe
therefore
that
we
are
more
snug
here
than
we
should
be
even
in
your
lordship
that
being
so
sir
hem
you
are
receiving
letters
daily
do
they
concern
the
business
of
king
james
in
a
measure
or
rather
they
are
from
one
concerned
in
ostermore
eyes
were
on
the
ground
again
there
fell
a
pause
caryll
frowning
slightly
and
full
of
curiosity
as
to
what
might
be
coming
how
soon
think
you
asked
his
lordship
presently
you
will
be
in
case
to
travel
in
a
week
i
hope
was
the
reply
the
earl
nodded
thoughtfully
that
may
be
in
time
i
pray
it
may
be
is
now
the
best
that
we
can
do
you
bear
a
letter
for
me
to
the
king
caryll
passed
a
hand
across
his
chin
his
face
very
grave
your
answer
to
the
letter
that
i
brought
you
my
answer
my
acceptance
of
his
majesty
ha
caryll
seemed
to
be
breathing
hard
your
letters
sir
the
letters
that
you
have
been
receiving
will
have
told
you
perhaps
something
of
how
his
majesty
affairs
are
speeding
here
very
little
and
from
that
little
i
fear
that
they
speed
none
too
well
i
would
counsel
your
lordship
he
continued
slowly
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
to
wait
a
while
before
you
burn
your
boats
from
what
i
gather
matters
are
in
the
air
just
the
earl
made
a
gesture
brusque
and
impatient
your
information
is
very
scant
then
said
he
caryll
looked
askance
at
him
pho
sir
while
you
have
been
abed
i
have
been
up
and
doing
up
and
doing
matters
are
being
pushed
forward
rapidly
i
have
seen
atterbury
he
knows
my
mind
there
lately
came
an
agent
from
the
king
it
seems
to
enjoin
the
bishop
to
abandon
this
conspiracy
telling
him
that
the
time
was
not
yet
ripe
atterbury
scorns
to
act
upon
that
order
he
will
work
in
the
king
interests
against
the
king
own
commands
then
is
possible
he
may
work
to
his
own
undoing
said
caryll
to
whom
this
was
after
all
no
news
nay
nay
you
have
been
sick
you
do
not
know
how
things
have
sped
in
this
past
month
atterbury
holds
and
he
is
right
i
dare
swear
he
holds
that
never
will
there
be
such
another
opportunity
the
finances
of
the
country
are
still
in
chaos
in
spite
of
all
walpole
efforts
and
fine
promises
the
south
sea
bubble
has
sapped
the
confidence
in
the
government
of
all
men
of
weight
the
very
whigs
themselves
are
shaken
is
to
king
james
england
begins
to
look
for
salvation
from
this
the
tide
runs
strongly
in
our
favor
strongly
sir
if
we
stay
for
the
ebb
we
may
stay
for
good
for
there
may
never
be
another
flow
within
our
your
lordship
is
grown
strangely
hot
upon
this
question
said
caryll
very
full
of
wonder
as
he
understood
ostermore
the
earl
was
scarcely
the
sentimentalist
to
give
way
to
such
a
passion
of
loyalty
for
a
weaker
side
yet
his
lordship
had
spoken
not
with
the
cold
calm
of
the
practical
man
who
seeks
advantage
but
with
all
the
fervor
of
the
enthusiast
such
is
my
interest
answered
his
lordship
even
as
the
fortunes
of
the
country
are
beggared
by
the
south
sea
company
so
are
my
own
even
as
the
country
must
look
to
king
james
for
its
salvation
so
must
i
at
best
is
but
a
forlorn
hope
i
confess
yet
is
the
only
hope
i
caryll
looked
at
him
smiled
to
himself
and
nodded
so
all
this
fire
and
enthusiasm
was
about
the
mending
of
his
personal
fortunes
the
grubbing
of
riches
for
himself
well
well
it
was
good
matter
wasted
on
a
paltry
cause
but
it
sorted
excellently
with
what
caryll
knew
of
the
nature
of
this
father
of
his
it
never
could
transcend
the
practical
there
was
no
imagination
to
carry
it
beyond
those
narrow
sordid
confines
and
caryll
had
been
a
fool
to
have
supposed
that
any
other
springs
were
pushing
here
egotism
egotism
egotism
its
name
he
thought
was
surely
ostermore
and
again
as
once
before
under
the
like
circumstances
he
found
more
pity
than
scorn
awaking
in
his
heart
the
whole
wasted
sterile
life
that
lay
behind
this
man
the
unhappy
loveless
home
that
stood
about
him
now
in
his
declining
years
were
the
fruits
he
had
garnered
from
that
consuming
love
of
self
with
which
the
gods
had
cursed
him
the
only
ray
to
illumine
the
black
desert
of
ostermore
existence
was
the
affection
of
his
ward
hortensia
winthrop
because
in
that
one
instance
he
had
sunk
his
egotism
a
little
sparing
a
crumb
of
pity
for
once
in
his
life
for
the
child
orphanhood
had
ostermore
been
other
than
the
man
he
was
his
existence
must
have
proved
a
burden
beyond
his
strength
it
was
so
barren
of
good
deeds
so
sterile
of
affection
yet
encrusted
as
he
was
in
that
egotism
of
his
like
the
limpet
in
its
shell
my
lord
perceived
nothing
of
this
suffered
nothing
of
it
understanding
nothing
he
was
to
himself
giving
nothing
he
looked
for
nothing
and
sought
his
happiness
without
knowing
the
quest
vain
in
what
he
had
the
fear
of
losing
this
had
now
in
his
declining
years
cast
at
length
a
shadow
upon
his
existence
caryll
looked
at
him
almost
sorrowfully
then
he
put
by
his
thoughts
and
broke
the
silence
all
this
i
had
understood
when
first
i
sought
you
out
said
he
yet
your
lordship
did
not
seem
to
realize
it
quite
so
keenly
is
it
that
atterbury
and
his
friends
no
no
ostermore
broke
in
i
will
be
frank
quite
frank
and
open
with
you
caryll
things
were
bad
when
first
you
came
to
me
yet
not
so
bad
that
i
was
driven
to
a
choice
of
evils
i
had
lost
heavily
but
enough
remained
to
bear
me
through
my
time
though
rotherby
might
have
found
little
enough
left
after
i
had
gone
while
that
was
so
i
hesitated
to
take
a
risk
i
am
an
old
man
it
had
been
different
had
i
been
young
with
ambitions
that
craved
satisfying
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
desired
peace
and
my
comforts
deeming
these
assured
i
paused
ere
i
risked
their
loss
against
the
stake
which
in
king
james
name
you
set
upon
the
board
but
it
happens
that
these
are
assured
no
longer
he
ended
his
voice
breaking
almost
his
eyes
haggard
they
are
assured
no
you
mean
inquired
caryll
i
mean
that
i
am
confronted
by
the
danger
of
beggary
ruin
shame
and
the
at
caryll
was
stirred
out
of
his
calm
my
lord
he
cried
how
is
this
possible
what
can
have
come
to
pass
the
earl
was
silent
for
a
long
while
it
was
as
if
he
pondered
how
he
should
answer
or
whether
he
should
answer
at
all
at
last
in
a
low
voice
a
faint
tinge
reddening
his
face
his
eyes
averted
he
explained
it
shamed
him
so
to
do
yet
must
he
satisfy
that
craving
of
weak
minds
to
unburden
to
seek
relief
in
confession
mine
is
the
case
of
craggs
the
secretary
of
state
he
said
and
craggs
you
remember
shot
my
god
said
caryll
and
opened
wide
his
eyes
did
he
paused
not
knowing
what
euphemism
to
supply
for
the
thing
his
lordship
must
have
done
his
lordship
looked
up
sneering
almost
in
i
did
he
answered
to
tell
you
all
i
accepted
twenty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
south
sea
stock
when
the
company
was
first
formed
for
which
i
did
not
pay
other
than
by
lending
the
scheme
the
support
of
my
name
at
a
time
when
such
support
was
needed
i
was
of
the
ministry
then
you
will
caryll
considered
him
again
and
wondered
a
moment
at
the
confession
till
he
understood
by
intuition
that
the
matter
and
its
consequences
were
so
deeply
preying
upon
the
man
mind
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
giving
vent
to
his
fears
and
now
you
know
his
lordship
added
why
my
hopes
are
all
in
king
james
ruin
stares
me
in
the
face
ruin
and
shame
this
forlorn
stuart
hope
is
the
only
hope
remaining
me
therefore
am
i
eager
to
embrace
it
i
have
made
all
plain
to
you
you
should
understand
yet
not
quite
all
you
did
this
thing
but
the
inspection
of
the
company
books
is
past
the
danger
of
discovery
at
least
is
averted
or
is
it
that
your
conscience
compels
you
to
make
restitution
his
lordship
stared
and
gaped
do
you
suppose
me
mad
he
inquired
quite
seriously
pho
others
were
overlooked
at
the
time
we
did
not
all
go
the
way
of
craggs
and
aislabie
and
their
stanhope
was
assailed
afterward
though
he
was
innocent
that
filthy
fellow
the
duke
of
wharton
from
being
an
empty
fop
turned
himself
on
a
sudden
into
a
crown
attorney
to
prosecute
the
peculators
it
was
an
easy
road
to
fame
for
him
and
the
fool
had
a
gift
of
eloquence
death
is
on
his
conscience
or
would
be
if
he
had
one
that
was
six
months
ago
when
he
discovered
his
error
in
the
case
of
stanhope
and
saw
the
fatal
consequences
it
had
he
ceased
his
dirty
lawyer
work
but
he
had
good
grounds
upon
which
to
suspect
others
as
highly
placed
as
stanhope
and
had
he
followed
his
suspicions
he
might
have
turned
them
into
certainties
and
discovered
evidence
as
it
was
he
let
the
matter
lie
content
with
the
execution
he
had
done
and
the
esteem
into
which
he
had
so
suddenly
hoisted
himself
the
damned
profligate
caryll
let
pass
as
typical
the
ludicrous
want
of
logic
in
ostermore
strictures
of
his
grace
of
wharton
and
the
application
by
him
to
the
duke
of
opprobrious
terms
that
were
no
whit
less
applicable
to
himself
then
that
being
so
what
cause
for
these
alarms
some
six
months
later
because
answered
his
lordship
in
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
that
brought
him
to
his
feet
empurpled
his
face
and
swelled
the
veins
of
his
forehead
because
i
am
cursed
with
the
filthiest
fellow
in
england
for
my
he
said
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
throws
a
flood
of
light
where
darkness
has
been
hitherto
who
supplies
the
key
that
must
resolve
at
a
turn
a
whole
situation
but
caryll
blinked
foolishly
my
wits
are
very
dull
i
fear
said
he
i
still
can
not
then
i
make
it
all
clear
to
you
said
his
lordship
leduc
appeared
at
the
arbor
entrance
what
now
asked
caryll
her
ladyship
is
approaching
sir
answered
leduc
the
vigilant
chapter
xiv
lady
ostermore
lord
ostermore
and
caryll
looked
across
the
lawn
towards
the
house
but
failed
to
see
any
sign
of
her
ladyship
approach
caryll
raised
questioning
eyes
to
his
servant
stolid
face
and
in
that
moment
caught
the
faintest
rustle
of
a
gown
behind
the
arbor
he
to
my
lord
and
nodded
slightly
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
a
smile
twisting
his
lips
with
a
gesture
he
dismissed
leduc
who
returned
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
pond
his
lordship
frowned
angered
by
the
interruption
then
if
your
ladyship
will
come
inside
said
he
you
will
hear
better
and
with
greater
not
to
speak
of
dignity
said
caryll
the
stiff
gown
rustled
again
this
time
without
stealth
the
countess
appeared
no
whit
abashed
caryll
rose
politely
you
sit
with
spies
to
guard
your
approaches
said
she
as
a
precaution
against
spies
was
his
lordship
curt
answer
she
measured
him
with
a
cool
eye
what
ye
hide
she
asked
him
my
shame
he
answered
readily
then
after
a
moment
pause
he
rose
and
offered
her
his
seat
since
you
have
thrust
yourself
in
where
you
were
not
bidden
you
may
hear
and
welcome
said
he
it
may
help
you
to
understand
what
you
term
my
injustice
to
my
are
these
matters
wherewith
to
importune
a
stranger
a
guest
i
am
proposing
to
say
in
your
presence
what
i
was
about
to
say
in
your
absence
said
he
without
answering
her
question
be
seated
she
sniffed
closed
her
fan
with
a
clatter
and
sat
down
caryll
resumed
his
long
chair
and
his
lordship
took
the
stool
i
am
told
the
latter
resumed
presently
recapitulating
in
part
for
her
ladyship
better
understanding
that
his
grace
of
wharton
is
intending
to
reopen
the
south
sea
scandal
as
soon
as
he
can
find
evidence
that
i
was
one
of
those
who
profited
by
the
company
profited
she
echoed
between
scorn
and
bitter
amusement
profited
did
ye
say
i
think
your
dotage
is
surely
upon
you
you
that
have
sunk
nigh
all
your
fortune
and
all
that
you
had
with
me
in
this
thieving
venture
d
talk
of
profits
at
the
commencement
i
did
profit
as
did
many
others
had
i
been
content
with
my
gains
had
i
been
less
of
a
trusting
fool
it
had
been
well
i
was
dazzled
maybe
by
the
glare
of
so
much
gold
i
needed
more
and
so
i
lost
all
that
is
evil
enough
but
there
is
worse
i
may
be
called
upon
to
make
restitution
of
what
i
had
from
the
company
without
paying
for
it
i
may
give
all
that
left
me
and
barely
cover
the
amount
and
i
may
starve
and
be
damned
her
ladyship
face
was
ghastly
horror
stared
from
her
pale
eyes
she
had
known
from
the
beginning
of
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
stock
and
she
had
had
with
his
lordship
her
anxious
moments
when
the
disclosures
were
being
made
six
months
ago
that
had
brought
the
craggses
aislabie
and
a
others
to
shame
and
ruin
his
lordship
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
if
this
shipwreck
comes
as
it
now
threatens
he
continued
it
is
my
son
i
shall
have
to
thank
she
found
voice
to
ask
how
so
courage
to
put
the
question
scornfully
is
it
not
rather
rotherby
you
have
to
thank
that
the
disclosures
did
not
come
six
months
ago
what
was
it
saved
you
but
the
friendship
his
grace
of
wharton
had
for
charles
why
then
stormed
his
lordship
did
he
not
see
that
he
preserved
that
friendship
it
but
needed
a
behavior
of
as
much
decency
and
honor
as
wharton
exacts
in
his
associates
and
the
lord
knows
how
much
that
is
he
sneered
as
it
is
he
has
gone
even
lower
than
that
abandoned
scourer
so
low
that
even
this
rakehell
duke
must
become
his
enemy
for
his
own
credit
sake
he
attempts
with
ladies
of
quality
and
he
attempts
murder
by
stabbing
through
the
back
a
gentleman
who
has
spared
his
worthless
life
not
even
the
president
of
the
hell
fire
club
can
countenance
these
things
strong
stomach
though
he
have
for
villainy
it
is
something
to
have
contrived
to
come
so
low
that
even
his
grace
of
wharton
must
turn
upon
him
and
swear
his
ruin
and
so
that
he
may
ruin
him
his
grace
is
determined
to
ruin
me
now
you
understand
madam
and
you
caryll
understood
he
understood
even
more
than
his
lordship
meant
him
to
understand
more
than
his
lordship
understood
himself
so
too
did
her
ladyship
if
we
may
judge
from
the
reply
she
made
him
you
fool
she
railed
you
vain
blind
selfish
fool
to
blame
rotherby
for
this
rather
should
rotherby
blame
you
that
by
your
damned
dishonesty
have
set
a
weapon
against
him
in
his
enemy
madam
he
roared
empurpling
and
coming
heavily
to
his
feet
do
you
know
who
i
am
ay
and
what
you
are
which
is
something
you
will
never
know
god
was
there
ever
so
a
fool
compassionate
me
heaven
she
rose
too
and
turned
to
caryll
you
sir
she
said
to
him
you
have
been
dragged
into
this
i
know
not
she
broke
off
suddenly
looking
at
him
her
eyes
a
pair
of
gimlets
now
for
penetration
why
have
you
been
dragged
into
it
she
demanded
what
is
here
i
demand
to
know
what
help
does
my
lord
expect
from
you
that
he
tells
you
this
does
he
she
paused
an
instant
a
cunning
smile
breaking
over
her
wrinkled
painted
face
does
he
propose
to
sell
himself
to
the
king
over
the
water
and
are
you
a
secret
agent
come
to
do
the
buying
is
that
the
answer
to
this
riddle
caryll
imperturbable
outwardly
but
very
ill
at
ease
within
smiled
and
waved
the
delicate
hand
that
appeared
through
the
heavy
ruffle
at
his
wrist
madam
indeed
ah
your
ladyship
goes
very
fast
you
leap
so
at
conclusions
for
which
no
grounds
can
exist
his
lordship
is
so
overwrought
as
well
he
may
be
alas
that
he
cares
not
before
whom
he
speaks
is
it
not
plainly
so
she
smiled
very
sourly
you
are
a
very
master
of
evasion
sir
but
your
evasion
gives
me
the
answer
that
i
lack
that
and
his
lordship
face
i
drew
my
bow
at
a
venture
yet
look
sir
and
tell
me
has
my
quarrel
missed
its
mark
and
indeed
the
sudden
fear
and
consternation
written
on
my
lord
face
was
so
plain
that
all
might
read
it
he
was
as
caryll
had
remarked
on
the
first
occasion
that
they
met
the
worst
dissembler
that
ever
set
hand
to
a
conspiracy
he
betrayed
himself
at
every
step
if
not
positively
by
incautious
words
why
then
by
the
utter
lack
of
control
he
had
upon
his
countenance
he
made
now
a
wild
attempt
to
bluster
lies
lies
he
protested
your
ladyship
should
i
be
making
bad
worse
by
plotting
at
my
time
of
life
should
i
what
can
king
james
avail
me
indeed
is
what
i
will
ask
rotherby
to
help
me
to
discover
she
informed
him
rotherby
he
cried
would
you
tell
that
villain
what
you
suspect
would
you
arm
him
with
another
weapon
for
my
undoing
ha
said
she
you
admit
so
much
then
and
she
laughed
disdainfully
then
with
a
sudden
sternness
a
sudden
nobility
almost
in
the
motherhood
which
she
put
forward
rotherby
is
my
son
she
said
and
i
not
have
my
son
the
victim
of
your
follies
as
well
as
of
your
injustice
we
may
curb
the
one
and
the
other
yet
my
and
she
swept
out
fan
going
briskly
in
one
hand
her
long
ebony
cane
swinging
as
briskly
in
the
other
o
god
groaned
ostermore
and
sat
down
heavily
caryll
helped
himself
copiously
to
snuff
i
think
said
he
his
voice
so
cool
that
it
had
an
almost
soothing
influence
i
think
your
lordship
has
now
another
reason
why
you
should
go
no
further
in
this
but
if
i
do
not
what
other
hopes
have
i
damn
me
i
a
ruined
man
either
nay
nay
caryll
reminded
him
assuming
even
that
you
are
correctly
informed
and
that
his
grace
of
wharton
is
determined
to
move
against
you
it
is
not
to
be
depended
that
he
will
succeed
in
collecting
such
evidence
as
he
must
need
at
this
date
much
of
the
evidence
that
may
once
have
been
available
will
have
been
dissipated
you
are
rash
to
despair
so
there
is
that
his
lordship
admitted
thoughtfully
a
little
hopefully
even
there
is
and
with
the
resilience
of
his
nature
of
men
who
form
opinions
on
slight
grounds
and
therefore
are
ready
to
change
them
upon
grounds
as
slight
i
faith
i
may
have
been
running
to
meet
my
trouble
is
but
a
rumor
after
all
that
wharton
is
for
mischief
and
as
you
say
as
like
as
not
there
be
no
evidence
by
now
there
was
little
enough
at
the
time
still
i
make
doubly
sure
my
letter
to
king
james
can
do
no
harm
we
talk
of
it
again
when
you
are
in
case
to
it
passed
through
caryll
mind
at
the
moment
that
lady
ostermore
and
her
son
might
between
them
brew
such
mischief
as
might
seriously
hinder
him
from
travelling
and
he
was
very
near
the
truth
for
already
her
ladyship
was
closeted
with
rotherby
in
her
boudoir
the
viscount
was
dressed
for
travelling
intent
upon
withdrawing
to
the
country
for
he
was
already
of
the
feeling
of
the
town
concerning
him
and
had
no
mind
to
brave
the
slights
and
that
would
await
him
did
he
penetrate
to
any
of
the
haunts
of
people
of
quality
and
fashion
he
stood
before
his
mother
now
a
tall
lank
figure
his
black
face
very
gloomy
his
sensual
lips
thrust
forward
in
a
sullen
pout
she
in
a
gilt
before
her
was
telling
him
the
story
of
what
had
passed
his
fear
of
ruin
and
disgrace
he
swore
between
his
teeth
when
he
heard
that
the
danger
threatened
from
the
duke
of
wharton
and
your
father
destitution
means
our
destitution
yours
and
mine
for
his
gambling
schemes
have
consumed
my
portion
long
he
laughed
and
shrugged
i
marvel
i
should
concern
myself
said
he
what
can
it
avail
me
to
save
the
rags
that
are
left
him
of
his
fortune
he
sworn
i
shall
never
touch
a
penny
that
he
may
die
possessed
but
there
the
entail
she
reminded
him
if
restitution
is
demanded
the
crown
will
not
respect
it
be
another
sop
to
throw
the
whining
curs
that
were
crippled
by
the
bubble
and
who
threaten
to
disturb
the
country
if
they
are
not
appeased
if
wharton
carries
out
this
exposure
we
beggars
utter
beggars
that
may
ask
an
alms
to
quiet
is
wharton
present
hate
of
me
said
he
thoughtfully
and
swore
the
damned
puppy
he
make
a
sacrifice
of
me
upon
the
altar
of
respectability
just
as
he
made
a
sacrifice
of
the
south
sea
bubblers
what
else
was
the
stinking
rakehell
seeking
but
to
put
himself
right
again
in
the
eyes
of
a
town
that
was
nauseated
with
him
and
his
excesses
the
toad
that
makes
virtue
his
profession
the
virtue
of
others
and
profligacy
his
recreation
he
smote
fist
into
palm
there
a
way
to
silence
ah
she
looked
up
quickly
hopefully
a
foot
or
so
of
steel
rotherby
explained
and
struck
the
hilt
of
his
sword
i
might
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
not
be
difficult
come
upon
him
unawares
say
and
strike
him
that
should
force
a
tusk
fool
he
all
empanoplied
in
virtue
where
you
are
concerned
he
use
the
matter
of
your
affair
with
caryll
as
a
reason
not
to
meet
you
whatever
you
might
do
and
he
set
his
grooms
to
punish
any
indignity
you
might
put
upon
he
durst
pooh
the
town
would
all
approve
him
in
it
since
your
running
caryll
through
the
back
what
a
fool
you
were
he
turned
away
hanging
his
head
full
conscious
and
with
no
little
bitterness
of
how
great
had
been
his
folly
salvation
may
lie
for
you
in
the
same
source
that
has
brought
you
to
the
present
pass
this
man
caryll
said
the
countess
presently
i
suspect
him
more
than
ever
of
being
a
jacobite
i
know
him
to
be
you
know
it
all
but
and
green
is
assured
of
it
he
proceeded
to
tell
her
what
he
knew
ever
since
green
met
caryll
at
maidstone
has
he
suspected
him
yet
but
that
i
kept
him
to
the
task
he
would
have
abandoned
it
he
in
my
pay
now
as
much
as
in
lord
carteret
and
if
he
can
run
caryll
to
earth
he
receives
his
wages
from
both
well
well
what
has
he
discovered
anything
a
little
this
caryll
frequented
regularly
the
house
of
one
everard
who
came
to
town
a
week
after
caryll
own
arrival
this
everard
sir
richard
everard
is
known
to
be
a
jacobite
he
is
the
paris
agent
they
would
have
laid
him
by
the
heels
before
but
that
by
precipitancy
they
feared
to
ruin
their
chances
of
discovering
the
business
that
may
have
brought
him
over
they
are
giving
him
rope
at
present
meanwhile
by
my
cursed
folly
caryll
visits
to
him
were
interrupted
but
there
has
been
correspondence
between
i
know
said
her
ladyship
a
letter
was
delivered
him
just
now
i
tried
to
smoke
him
concerning
it
but
he
too
astute
or
not
replied
her
son
once
he
leaves
stretton
house
it
should
not
be
long
ere
he
betrays
himself
and
gives
us
cause
to
lay
him
by
the
heels
but
how
will
that
help
us
do
you
ask
how
why
if
there
is
a
plot
and
we
can
discover
it
we
might
make
terms
with
the
secretary
of
state
to
avoid
any
disclosure
wharton
may
intend
concerning
the
south
sea
but
that
would
be
to
discover
my
father
for
a
jacobite
what
advantage
should
we
derive
from
that
be
as
bad
as
let
me
die
but
ye
a
clod
charles
d
think
we
can
find
no
way
to
disclose
the
plot
and
caryll
and
everard
too
if
you
choose
without
including
your
father
my
lord
is
timidly
cautious
and
you
may
depend
he
not
have
put
himself
in
their
hands
to
any
extent
just
the
viscount
paced
the
chamber
slowly
in
long
strides
head
bent
in
thought
hands
clasped
behind
him
it
will
need
consideration
said
he
but
it
may
serve
and
i
can
count
upon
green
he
is
satisfied
that
caryll
befooled
him
at
maidstone
and
that
he
kept
the
papers
he
carried
despite
the
thoroughness
of

at

she
detested
to
have
it

to
her
he
bowed
again
gained
the

and
would
have
passed
out
but
that
she
detained

love
and
rage
lord
rotherby
descending
from
that
interview
with
his
mother
espied
hortensia
crossing
the
hall
below
forgetting
his
dignity
he
quickened
his
movements
and
took
the
remainder
of
the
stairs
two
at
a
stride
but
then
his
lordship
was
excited
and
angry
and
considerations
of
dignity
did
not
obtain
with
him
at
the
time
for
that
matter
they
seldom
did
hortensia
hortensia
he
called
to
her
and
at
his
call
she
paused
not
once
during
the
month
that
was
past
and
during
which
he
had
for
the
most
part
kept
his
room
to
all
intents
a
prisoner
had
she
exchanged
so
much
as
a
word
with
him
thus
not
seeing
him
she
had
been
able
to
an
extent
to
exclude
him
from
her
thoughts
which
naturally
enough
were
reluctant
to
entertain
him
for
their
guest
her
calm
as
she
paused
now
in
acquiescence
to
his
bidding
was
such
that
it
almost
surprised
herself
she
had
loved
him
once
or
thought
so
a
little
month
ago
and
at
a
single
blow
he
had
slain
that
love
now
love
so
slain
has
a
trick
of
resurrecting
in
the
guise
of
hate
and
so
she
had
thought
at
first
had
been
the
case
with
her
but
this
moment
proved
to
her
now
that
her
love
was
dead
indeed
since
of
her
erstwhile
affection
not
even
a
recoil
to
hate
remained
dislike
she
may
have
felt
but
it
was
that
cold
dislike
that
breeds
a
deadly
indifference
and
seeks
no
active
expression
asking
no
more
than
the
avoidance
of
its
object
her
calm
reflected
in
her
face
of
a
beauty
almost
spiritual
in
every
steady
line
of
her
slight
graceful
figure
gave
him
pause
a
moment
and
his
hot
glance
fell
abashed
before
the
chill
indifference
that
met
him
from
those
brown
eyes
a
man
of
deeper
sensibilities
of
keener
perceptions
would
have
bowed
and
gone
his
way
but
then
a
man
of
deeper
sensibilities
would
never
have
sought
this
interview
that
the
viscount
was
now
seeking
therefore
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
recover
swiftly
from
his
momentary
halt
and
step
aside
to
throw
open
the
door
of
a
little
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
bowing
slightly
he
invited
her
to
enter
grant
me
a
moment
ere
i
go
hortensia
he
said
between
command
and
exhortation
she
stood
cogitating
him
an
instant
with
no
outward
sign
of
what
might
be
passing
in
her
mind
then
she
slightly
inclined
her
head
and
went
forward
as
he
bade
her
it
was
a
sunny
room
gay
with
light
color
and
dainty
furnishings
having
long
that
opened
to
the
garden
an
aubusson
carpet
of
palest
green
with
a
festoon
pattern
of
pink
roses
covered
of
the
blocked
polished
floor
the
empanelled
walls
were
white
with
here
a
gilt
mirror
flanked
on
either
side
by
a
girandole
in
ormolu
a
spinet
stood
open
in
and
upon
it
were
sheets
of
music
a
few
books
and
a
bowl
of
ware
charged
now
with
roses
whose
fragrance
lay
heavy
on
the
air
there
were
two
or
three
small
tables
of
very
dainty
fragile
make
and
the
chairs
were
in
tapestry
illustrating
the
fables
of
la
fontaine
it
was
an
apartment
looked
upon
by
hortensia
as
her
own
set
apart
for
her
own
use
and
as
that
the
household
her
very
ladyship
included
had
ever
recognized
it
his
lordship
closed
the
door
with
care
hortensia
took
her
seat
upon
the
long
stool
that
stood
at
the
spinet
her
back
to
the
instrument
and
with
hands
idle
in
her
lap
the
same
cold
reserve
upon
her
awaited
his
communication
he
advanced
until
he
was
close
beside
her
and
stood
leaning
an
elbow
on
the
corner
of
the
spinet
a
long
and
not
ungraceful
figure
with
the
black
curls
of
his
wig
falling
about
his
swarthy
face
i
have
but
my
farewells
to
make
hortensia
said
he
i
am
leaving
stretton
house
at
i
am
glad
said
she
in
a
formal
level
voice
that
things
should
have
fallen
out
so
as
to
leave
you
free
to
go
your
you
are
glad
he
answered
frowning
slightly
and
leaning
farther
towards
her
ay
and
why
are
you
glad
why
you
are
glad
for
caryll
sake
do
you
deny
it
she
looked
up
at
him
quite
calm
and
fearlessly
i
am
glad
for
your
own
sake
his
dark
brooding
eyes
looked
deep
into
hers
which
did
not
falter
under
his
insistent
gaze
am
i
to
believe
you
he
inquired
why
not
i
do
not
wish
your
not
my
death
but
my
absence
he
sneered
you
wish
for
that
do
you
not
you
would
prefer
me
gone
my
room
is
better
than
my
company
just
now
is
what
you
think
eh
i
have
not
thought
of
it
at
all
she
answered
him
with
a
pitiless
frankness
he
laughed
soft
and
wickedly
is
it
so
very
hopeless
then
you
have
not
thought
of
it
at
all
by
which
you
mean
that
you
have
not
thought
of
me
at
not
best
so
you
have
given
me
no
cause
to
think
of
you
to
your
advantage
i
am
therefore
kind
to
exclude
you
from
my
kind
he
mocked
her
you
think
it
kind
to
put
me
from
your
mind
i
who
love
you
hortensia
she
rose
upon
the
instant
her
cheeks
warming
faintly
my
lord
said
she
i
think
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
between
ah
but
there
is
he
cried
a
deal
more
and
he
left
his
place
by
the
spinet
to
come
and
stand
immediately
before
her
barring
her
passage
to
the
door
not
only
to
say
farewell
was
it
that
i
desired
to
speak
with
you
alone
his
voice
softened
amazingly
i
want
your
pardon
ere
i
go
i
want
you
to
say
that
you
forgive
me
the
vile
thing
i
would
have
done
contrition
quivered
in
his
lowered
voice
he
bent
a
knee
to
her
and
held
out
his
hand
i
will
not
rise
until
you
speak
my
pardon
why
if
that
be
all
i
pardon
you
very
readily
she
answered
still
betraying
no
emotion
he
frowned
too
readily
he
cried
too
readily
for
sincerity
i
will
not
take
it
indeed
my
lord
for
a
penitent
you
are
very
difficult
to
please
i
pardon
you
with
all
my
you
are
sincere
he
cried
and
sought
to
take
her
hands
but
she
whipped
them
away
and
behind
her
you
bear
me
no
she
considered
him
now
with
a
calm
critical
gaze
before
which
he
was
forced
to
lower
his
bold
eyes
why
should
i
bear
you
an
she
asked
him
for
the
thing
i
did
the
thing
i
sought
to
i
wonder
do
you
know
all
that
you
did
she
asked
him
musingly
shall
i
tell
you
my
lord
you
cured
me
of
a
folly
i
had
been
blind
and
you
made
me
see
i
had
foolishly
thought
to
escape
one
evil
and
you
made
me
realize
that
i
was
rushing
into
a
worse
you
saved
me
from
myself
you
may
have
made
me
suffer
then
but
it
was
a
healing
hurt
you
dealt
me
and
should
i
bear
you
an
for
that
he
had
risen
from
his
knee
he
stood
apart
pondering
her
from
under
bent
brows
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
angry
fire
i
do
not
think
she
ended
that
there
needs
more
between
us
i
have
understood
you
sir
since
that
day
at
maidstone
i
think
we
were
strangers
until
then
and
perhaps
now
you
may
begin
to
understand
me
fare
you
well
my
she
made
shift
to
go
but
he
barred
her
passage
now
in
earnest
his
hands
clenched
beside
him
in
witness
of
the
violence
he
did
himself
to
keep
them
there
not
yet
he
said
in
a
deep
concentrated
voice
not
yet
i
did
you
a
wrong
i
know
and
what
you
say
cruel
as
it
is
is
no
more
than
i
deserve
but
i
desire
to
make
amends
i
love
you
hortensia
and
desire
to
make
she
smiled
wistfully
is
overlate
to
talk
of
why
he
demanded
fiercely
and
caught
her
arms
holding
her
there
before
him
why
is
it
overlate
suffer
me
to
go
she
commanded
rather
than
begged
and
made
to
free
herself
of
his
grasp
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
hortensia
my
wedded
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
a
cold
laugh
disdainful
yet
not
bitter
you
wanted
that
before
my
lord
yet
you
neglected
the
opportunity
my
folly
gave
you
i
thank
you
you
after
god
for
that
same
ah
do
not
say
that
he
begged
a
very
suppliant
again
do
not
say
that
child
i
love
you
do
you
understand
who
could
fail
to
understand
after
the
abundant
proof
you
have
afforded
me
of
your
sincerity
and
your
devotion
do
you
rally
me
he
demanded
letting
through
a
flash
of
the
anger
that
was
mounting
in
him
am
i
so
poor
a
thing
that
you
whet
your
little
wit
upon
me
my
lord
you
are
paining
me
what
can
you
look
to
gain
by
this
suffer
me
to
a
moment
yet
he
stood
holding
her
wrists
and
looking
down
into
her
eyes
with
a
mixture
of
pleading
and
ferocity
in
his
then
he
made
a
sound
in
his
throat
and
caught
her
bodily
to
him
his
arms
laced
about
her
held
her
bound
and
crushed
against
him
his
dark
flushed
face
hovered
above
her
own
fear
took
her
at
last
it
mounted
and
grew
to
horror
let
me
go
my
lord
she
besought
him
her
voice
trembling
oh
let
me
go
i
love
you
hortensia
i
need
you
he
cried
as
if
wrung
by
pain
and
then
hot
upon
her
brow
and
cheeks
and
lips
his
kisses
fell
and
shame
turned
her
to
fire
from
head
to
foot
as
she
fought
helplessly
within
his
crushing
grasp
you
dog
she
panted
and
writhing
harder
wrenched
free
a
hand
and
arm
blindly
she
beat
upwards
into
that
evil
satyr
face
you
beast
you
toad
you
coward
they
fell
apart
each
panting
she
leaning
faint
against
the
spinet
her
bosom
galloping
he
muttering
oaths
decent
and
other
for
in
the
upward
thrusting
of
her
little
hand
one
of
its
fingers
had
prodded
at
an
eye
and
the
pain
of
it
which
had
caused
him
to
relax
his
hold
of
her
stripped
what
little
veneer
remained
upon
the
man
true
nature
will
you
go
she
asked
him
furiously
outraged
by
the
vileness
of
his
ravings
will
you
go
or
must
i
summon
help
he
stood
looking
at
her
straightening
his
wig
which
had
become
disarranged
in
the
struggle
and
forcing
himself
to
an
outward
calm
so
he
said
you
scorn
me
you
will
not
marry
me
you
realise
the
chance
eh
and
why
why
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
blind
to
the
honor
of
the
alliance
she
controlled
herself
to
answer
him
will
you
go
he
did
not
move
yet
you
loved
me
once
is
a
lie
she
blazed
i
thought
i
did
to
my
undying
shame
no
more
than
that
my
lord
as
i
a
soul
to
be
you
loved
me
he
insisted
and
you
would
love
me
still
but
for
this
damned
caryll
this
french
coxcomb
who
has
crawled
into
your
regard
like
the
slimy
creeping
thing
he
it
sorts
well
with
your
ways
my
lord
that
you
could
say
these
things
behind
his
back
you
are
practiced
at
stabbing
men
the
gibe
with
all
the
hurtful
stinging
quality
that
only
truth
possesses
struck
his
anger
from
him
leaving
him
limp
and
pale
then
he
recovered
do
you
know
who
he
is
what
he
is
he
asked
i
will
tell
you
he
a
spy
a
damned
jacobite
spy
whom
a
word
from
me
will
her
eyes
lashed
him
with
her
scorn
i
were
a
fool
did
i
believe
you
was
her
contemptuous
answer
ask
him
he
said
and
laughed
he
turned
and
strode
to
the
door
paused
there
sardonic
looking
back
i
shall
be
quits
with
you
quits
i
hang
this
pretty
turtle
of
yours
at
tyburn
tell
him
so
from
he
wrenched
the
door
open
and
went
out
on
that
leaving
her
cold
and
sick
with
dread
was
it
but
an
idle
threat
to
terrorize
her
was
it
but
that
her
impulse
was
to
seek
caryll
upon
the
instant
that
she
might
ask
him
and
allay
her
fears
but
what
right
had
she
upon
what
grounds
could
she
set
a
question
upon
so
secret
a
matter
she
conceived
him
raising
his
brows
in
that
supercilious
way
of
his
and
looking
her
over
from
head
to
toe
as
though
seeking
a
clue
to
the
nature
of
this
quaint
thing
that
asked
him
questions
she
pictured
his
smile
and
the
jest
with
which
he
would
set
aside
her
inquiry
she
imagined
indeed
just
what
she
believed
would
happen
did
she
ask
him
which
was
precisely
what
would
not
have
happened
imagining
thus
she
held
her
peace
and
nursed
her
secret
dread
and
on
the
following
day
his
weakness
so
far
overcome
as
to
leave
him
no
excuse
to
linger
at
stretton
house
caryll
took
his
departure
and
returned
to
his
lodging
in
old
palace
yard
one
more
treasonable
interview
had
he
with
lord
ostermore
in
the
library
ere
he
departed
his
lordship
it
was
who
reopened
again
the
question
to
repeat
much
of
what
he
had
said
in
the
arbor
on
the
previous
day
and
caryll
replied
with
much
the
same
arguments
in
favor
of
procrastination
that
he
had
already
employed
wait
at
least
he
begged
until
i
have
been
abroad
a
day
or
two
and
felt
for
myself
how
the
wind
is
is
a
prodigiously
dangerous
document
he
declared
i
scarce
see
the
need
for
so
much
how
can
it
set
but
one
way
is
a
question
i
shall
be
in
better
case
to
answer
when
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
judging
meanwhile
be
assured
i
shall
not
sail
for
france
without
advising
you
time
enough
then
to
give
me
your
letter
should
you
still
be
of
the
same
be
it
so
said
the
earl
when
all
is
said
the
letter
will
be
safer
here
meantime
than
in
your
and
he
tapped
the
secretaire
but
see
what
i
have
writ
his
majesty
and
tell
me
should
i
alter
he
took
out
a
drawer
on
the
right
took
it
out
bodily
then
introduced
his
hand
into
the
opening
running
it
along
the
inner
side
of
the
desk
until
no
doubt
he
touched
a
spring
for
suddenly
a
small
trap
was
opened
from
this
cavity
he
fished
out
two
documents
one
the
flimsy
tissue
on
which
king
james
later
was
penned
the
other
on
heavier
material
lord
ostermore
reply
he
spread
the
latter
before
him
and
handed
it
to
caryll
who
ran
an
eye
over
it
it
was
indited
with
stupid
characteristic
incaution
concealment
was
never
once
resorted
to
everywhere
expressions
of
the
frankest
were
employed
and
every
line
breathed
the
full
measure
of
his
treason
and
betrays
the
existence
of
a
plot
caryll
returned
it
his
countenance
was
grave
i
desire
his
majesty
to
know
how
i
belong
to
best
destroyed
i
think
you
can
write
another
when
the
time
comes
to
dispatch
but
ostermore
was
never
one
to
take
sensible
advice
pooh
be
safe
in
here
is
a
secret
known
to
he
dropped
it
together
with
king
james
letter
back
into
the
recess
snapped
down
the
trap
and
replaced
the
drawer
whereupon
caryll
took
his
leave
promising
to
advise
his
lordship
of
whatever
he
might
glean
and
so
departed
from
stretton
house
my
lord
rotherby
meanwhile
was
very
diligent
in
the
business
upon
which
he
was
intent
he
had
received
in
his
interview
with
hortensia
an
added
spur
to
such
action
as
might
be
scatheful
to
caryll
his
lordship
was
lodged
in
portugal
row
within
a
stone
throw
of
his
father
house
and
there
on
that
same
evening
of
his
moving
thither
he
had
green
to
see
him
desiring
news
green
had
little
to
impart
but
strong
hope
of
much
to
be
garnered
presently
his
little
eyes
twinkling
his
chubby
face
suffused
in
smiles
as
though
it
were
an
excellent
jest
to
be
hunting
knowledge
that
should
hang
a
man
the
spy
assured
lord
rotherby
that
there
was
little
doubt
caryll
could
be
implicated
as
soon
as
he
was
about
again
and
that
the
reason
after
your
lordship
own
express
wishes
why
so
far
i
have
let
sir
richard
everard
be
it
may
come
to
trouble
for
me
with
my
lord
carteret
should
it
be
smoked
that
i
have
been
silent
on
the
matters
within
my
knowledge
but
oh
a
plague
on
that
said
his
lordship
you
be
well
paid
for
your
services
when
you
rendered
them
and
meanwhile
i
understand
that
not
another
soul
in
london
that
is
on
the
side
of
the
government
is
aware
of
sir
richard
presence
in
town
so
where
is
your
danger
true
said
green
plump
hand
caressing
plumper
chin
had
it
not
been
so
i
should
have
been
forced
to
apply
to
the
secretary
for
a
warrant
before
then
you
wait
said
his
lordship
and
you
act
as
i
may
direct
you
it
will
be
to
your
credit
in
the
end
wait
until
caryll
has
enmeshed
himself
by
frequent
visits
to
sir
richard
then
get
your
warrant
when
i
give
the
word
and
execute
it
one
fine
night
when
caryll
happens
to
be
closeted
with
everard
whether
we
can
get
further
evidence
against
him
or
not
that
circumstance
of
his
being
found
with
the
pretender
agent
should
go
some
way
towards
hanging
him
the
rest
we
must
green
smiled
seraphically
ecod
i
give
my
ears
to
have
the
slippery
fellow
safe
codso
i
would
he
bubbled
me
at
maidstone
and
i
limped
a
fortnight
from
the
kick
he
gave
he
shall
do
a
little
more
kicking
with
both
feet
said
his
lordship
with
unction
chapter
xvi
green
executes
his
warrant
five
days
later
caryll
whose
recovery
had
so
far
progressed
that
he
might
now
be
said
to
be
his
own
man
again
came
briskly
up
from
charing
cross
one
evening
at
dusk
to
the
house
at
the
corner
of
maiden
lane
where
sir
richard
everard
was
lodged
he
observed
three
or
four
fellows
lounging
about
the
corner
of
chandos
street
and
bedford
street
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
from
that
point
they
could
command
sir
richard
door
nor
that
such
could
be
their
object
until
as
he
swung
sharply
round
the
corner
he
hurtled
violently
into
a
man
who
was
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
without
looking
whither
he
was
going
the
man
stepped
quickly
aside
with
a
murmured
word
of
apology
to
give
caryll
the
wall
that
he
might
pass
on
but
caryll
paused
ah
green
said
he
very
pleasantly
how
d
have
ye
been
searching
folk
of
late
green
endeavored
to
dissemble
his
startled
expression
in
a
grin
that
revealed
his
white
teeth
ye
ca
forgive
me
that
blunder
caryll
said
he
caryll
smiled
fondly
upon
him
from
your
manner
i
take
it
that
on
your
side
you
practice
a
more
christian
virtue
it
is
plain
that
you
forgive
me
the
green
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
you
were
in
the
right
sir
you
were
in
the
right
he
explained
those
are
the
risks
a
man
of
my
calling
must
run
i
must
suffer
for
my
caryll
continued
to
smile
but
that
the
light
was
failing
the
spy
might
have
observed
a
certain
hardening
in
the
lines
of
his
mouth
here
is
a
very
humble
mood
said
he
it
is
like
the
crouch
before
the
spring
in
whom
do
you
design
to
plant
your
claws
yours
and
your
friends
and
he
pointed
with
his
cane
across
the
street
towards
the
loungers
he
had
observed
my
friends
quoth
green
in
a
voice
of
disgust
nay
your
honor
no
friends
of
mine
ecod
indeed
no
no
i
am
at
fault
then
yet
they
look
as
if
they
might
be
bumbailiffs
is
the
kind
ye
herd
with
not
give
you
and
he
went
on
cool
and
unconcerned
and
turned
in
through
the
narrow
doorway
by
the
glover
shop
to
mount
the
stairs
to
sir
lodging
green
stood
still
to
watch
him
go
then
he
swore
through
his
teeth
and
beckoned
one
of
those
whose
acquaintance
he
had
disclaimed
is
like
him
ecod
to
have
gone
in
in
spite
of
seeing
me
and
you
he
cool
damned
cool
but
he
be
cooler
yet
codso
then
briskly
questioning
his
satellite
is
sir
richard
within
jerry
ay
answered
jerry
a
rough
tatterdemalion
he
been
there
these
two
is
our
chance
to
nab
both
last
chance
maybe
the
game
is
up
that
fine
gentleman
has
smoked
he
was
angry
beyond
measure
their
plans
were
far
from
ripe
and
yet
to
delay
longer
now
that
their
vigilance
was
detected
was
perhaps
to
allow
sir
richard
to
slip
through
their
fingers
as
well
as
the
other
have
ye
your
barkers
he
asked
harshly
jerry
tapped
a
heavily
bulging
pocket
and
winked
green
thrust
his
hat
over
one
eye
and
with
his
hands
behind
the
tails
of
his
coat
stood
pondering
ay
pox
o
he
grumbled
it
must
be
done
i
durs
delay
longer
we
give
the
gentlemen
time
to
settle
comfortably
then
up
we
go
to
make
things
merry
for
and
he
beckoned
the
others
across
meanwhile
caryll
had
gone
up
with
considerable
misgivings
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
sir
richard
that
day
at
stretton
house
had
been
to
apprise
him
that
his
adoptive
father
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
town
but
that
he
would
be
returned
within
the
week
the
business
that
had
taken
him
had
been
again
concerned
with
atterbury
the
obstinate
upon
another
vain
endeavor
to
dissuade
the
bishop
from
a
scheme
his
king
did
not
approve
had
sir
richard
journeyed
to
rochester
he
had
had
his
pains
for
nothing
atterbury
had
kept
him
there
entertaining
him
and
seeking
in
his
turn
to
engulf
the
agent
in
the
business
that
was
toward
business
which
was
ultimately
to
suck
down
atterbury
and
his
associates
sir
richard
however
was
very
firm
and
when
at
last
he
left
rochester
to
return
to
town
and
his
adoptive
son
a
coolness
marked
the
parting
of
those
two
adherents
of
the
stuart
dynasty
returned
to
london
whence
his
absence
had
been
marked
with
alarm
by
green
sir
richard
had
sent
a
message
to
caryll
and
the
latter
made
haste
to
answer
it
in
person
his
adoptive
father
received
him
with
open
arms
and
such
a
joy
in
his
face
such
a
light
in
his
old
eyes
as
should
have
gladdened
his
visitor
yet
only
served
sadden
him
the
more
he
sighed
as
sir
richard
thrust
him
back
that
he
might
look
at
him
ye
pale
boy
he
said
and
ye
look
and
with
that
he
fell
to
reviling
the
deed
that
was
the
cause
of
this
rotherby
and
the
whole
brood
of
ostermore
let
be
said
caryll
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
rotherby
is
undergoing
his
punishment
the
town
looks
on
him
as
a
who
has
narrowly
escaped
the
gallows
i
marvel
that
he
tarries
here
an
i
were
he
i
think
i
travel
for
a
year
or
what
weakness
made
you
spare
him
when
ye
had
him
at
the
point
of
your
sword
that
which
made
me
regret
that
i
had
him
there
the
reflection
that
he
is
my
sir
richard
looked
at
him
in
some
surprise
i
thought
you
of
sterner
stuff
justin
he
said
presently
and
sighed
passing
a
long
white
hand
across
his
bony
brow
i
thought
i
had
reared
you
to
a
finer
strength
but
there
what
of
ostermore
himself
what
of
him
have
you
not
talked
again
with
him
of
the
matter
of
going
over
to
king
james
to
what
end
since
the
chance
is
lost
his
betrayal
now
would
involve
the
betrayal
of
atterbury
and
the
others
for
he
has
been
in
touch
with
has
he
though
the
bishop
said
naught
of
i
have
it
from
my
lord
himself
and
i
know
the
man
were
he
taken
they
wring
out
of
him
whatever
happened
to
be
in
him
he
has
no
discretion
indeed
he
but
a
clod
too
stupid
even
to
be
aware
of
his
own
then
what
is
to
be
done
inquired
sir
richard
frowning
we
best
get
home
to
france
and
leave
matters
thus
he
considered
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
smiling
bitterly
could
that
content
you
justin
could
you
go
as
you
have
come
taking
no
more
than
you
brought
leaving
that
man
as
you
found
him
could
you
caryll
looked
at
the
baronet
and
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
he
should
persevere
in
the
rule
of
his
life
and
deal
quite
frankly
with
him
telling
him
precisely
what
he
felt
then
he
realized
that
he
would
not
be
understood
he
could
not
combat
the
fanaticism
that
was
sir
richard
in
this
matter
if
he
told
him
the
truth
how
he
loathed
the
task
how
he
rejoiced
that
circumstances
had
now
put
it
beyond
his
reach
all
he
would
achieve
would
be
to
wound
sir
richard
in
his
tenderest
place
and
to
no
purpose
it
is
not
a
matter
of
what
i
would
he
answered
slowly
wearily
almost
it
is
a
matter
of
what
i
must
here
in
england
is
no
more
to
be
done
moreover
there
danger
for
you
in
lingering
or
i
much
mistaken
danger
of
what
asked
sir
richard
with
indifference
you
are
being
spied
pho
i
am
accustomed
to
it
i
have
been
spied
upon
all
my
like
enough
but
this
time
the
spies
are
messengers
from
the
secretary
of
state
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
lurking
about
your
doorway
three
or
four
at
least
and
as
i
entered
i
all
but
fell
over
a
green
a
most
pertinacious
gentleman
with
whom
i
have
already
some
acquaintance
he
is
the
very
man
who
searched
me
at
maidstone
he
has
kept
his
eye
upon
me
ever
since
which
has
not
troubled
me
but
that
he
should
keep
an
eye
on
you
means
that
your
identity
is
suspected
and
if
that
be
so
well
the
sooner
we
are
out
of
england
the
better
for
your
sir
richard
shook
his
head
calmly
the
lean
old
face
showed
no
sign
of
uneasiness
a
fig
for
all
that
said
he
i
go
not
thus
as
i
came
after
all
these
years
of
a
knock
fell
upon
the
door
and
sir
richard
man
entered
his
face
was
white
his
eyes
startled
sir
richard
he
announced
his
voice
lowered
portentously
there
are
some
men
here
who
insist
upon
seeing
caryll
wheeled
in
his
chair
surely
they
did
not
ask
for
him
by
name
he
inquired
in
the
same
low
key
employed
by
the
valet
the
man
nodded
in
silence
caryll
swore
through
his
teeth
sir
richard
rose
i
am
occupied
at
present
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
i
can
receive
nobody
desire
to
know
their
business
if
it
imports
bid
them
come
again
it
is
for
that
sir
richard
everard
came
the
soft
voice
of
green
who
thrust
himself
suddenly
forward
past
the
servant
other
figures
were
seen
moving
behind
him
in
the
sir
cried
sir
richard
angrily
this
is
a
most
insolent
intrusion
bentley
show
this
fellow
the
bentley
set
a
hand
on
green
shoulder
green
nimbly
twisted
out
of
it
and
produced
a
paper
i
have
here
a
warrant
for
your
apprehension
sir
richard
from
my
lord
carteret
the
secretary
of
caryll
advanced
menacingly
upon
the
tipstaff
green
stepped
back
and
fell
into
a
defensive
attitude
balancing
a
short
but
keep
your
distance
sir
or
be
the
worse
for
you
he
threatened
hi
he
called
jerry
beattie
jerry
beattie
and
two
other
ruffians
crowded
to
the
doorway
but
advanced
little
beyond
the
threshold
caryll
turned
to
sir
richard
but
green
was
the
first
to
speak
sir
richard
said
he
you
see
that
we
are
but
instruments
of
the
law
it
grieves
me
profoundly
to
have
you
for
our
object
but
see
that
is
no
affair
of
ours
who
have
but
to
do
the
duty
that
ordered
ye
not
give
these
poor
fellows
trouble
i
trust
surrender
sir
richard
answer
was
to
pull
open
a
drawer
in
the
by
which
he
was
standing
and
whip
out
a
pistol
what
exactly
he
may
have
intended
he
was
never
allowed
to
announce
an
explosion
shook
the
room
coming
from
the
doorway
upon
which
caryll
had
turned
his
shoulder
there
was
a
spurt
of
flame
and
sir
richard
collapsed
forward
onto
the
table
and
slithered
thence
to
the
ground
jerry
taking
fright
at
the
sight
of
the
pistol
sir
richard
had
produced
had
forestalled
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
intentions
by
firing
instantly
upon
him
with
this
disastrous
result
confusion
ensued
caryll
with
no
more
thought
for
the
tipstaves
than
he
had
for
the
smoke
in
his
eyes
or
the
stench
of
powder
in
his
nostrils
sped
to
sir
richard
in
a
passion
of
grief
and
anxiety
he
raised
his
adoptive
father
aided
by
bentley
what
time
green
was
abusing
jerry
and
jerry
was
urging
in
exculpation
how
he
had
acted
purely
in
green
interest
fearing
that
sir
richard
might
have
been
on
the
point
of
shooting
him
the
spy
went
forward
to
caryll
i
am
most
profoundly
sorry
he
began
take
your
sorrow
to
hell
snarled
caryll
his
face
livid
his
eyes
blazing
uncannily
i
believe
ye
murdered
ecod
the
fool
shall
smart
if
sir
richard
dies
grumbled
green
what
that
to
me
you
may
hang
the
muckworm
and
what
shall
that
profit
any
one
will
it
restore
me
sir
richard
life
send
one
of
your
ruffians
for
a
doctor
man
and
bid
him
green
obeyed
with
alacrity
apart
from
his
regrets
at
this
happening
for
its
own
sake
it
would
suit
his
interests
not
at
all
that
sir
richard
should
perish
thus
meanwhile
with
the
help
of
the
valet
who
was
blubbering
like
a
child
for
he
had
been
with
sir
richard
for
over
ten
years
and
was
attached
to
him
as
a
dog
to
its
master
they
opened
the
wounded
man
sodden
waistcoat
and
shirt
and
reached
the
hurt
which
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
breast
between
them
they
lifted
him
up
gently
green
would
have
lent
a
hand
but
a
snarl
from
caryll
drove
him
back
in
sheer
terror
and
alone
those
two
bore
the
baronet
into
the
next
room
and
laid
him
on
his
bed
here
they
did
the
little
that
they
could
propping
him
up
and
stemming
the
bleeding
what
time
they
waited
through
what
seemed
a
century
for
the
doctor
coming
caryll
mad
stark
mad
for
the
time
with
grief
and
rage
the
physician
arrived
at
last
a
small
man
under
a
great
gray
periwig
with
pointed
features
and
little
eyes
that
beamed
brightly
behind
spectacles
in
the
he
was
met
by
green
who
in
in
a
few
words
told
him
what
had
happened
then
the
doctor
entered
the
bedchamber
alone
and
deposing
hat
and
cane
went
forward
to
make
his
examination
caryll
and
bentley
stood
aside
to
give
place
to
him
he
stooped
felt
the
pulse
examined
the
lips
of
the
wound
estimating
the
locality
and
direction
of
the
bullet
and
his
mouth
made
a
clucking
sound
as
of
deprecation
very
deplorable
very
deplorable
he
muttered
so
hale
a
man
too
despite
his
years
very
deplorable
he
looked
up
a
jacobite
ye
say
he
is
sir
will
he
live
inquired
caryll
shortly
by
way
of
recalling
the
man
of
medicine
to
the
fact
that
politics
was
not
the
business
on
which
he
had
been
summoned
the
doctor
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
at
caryll
over
the
top
of
his
spectacles
he
will
live
thank
god
breathed
caryll
perhaps
an
hour
the
doctor
concluded
and
never
knew
how
near
was
caryll
to
striking
him
he
turned
again
to
his
patient
producing
a
probe
very
deplorable
caryll
heard
him
muttering
a
pause
ensued
and
a
silence
broken
only
by
occasional
cluckings
from
the
little
doctor
and
caryll
stood
by
a
prey
to
an
anguish
more
poignant
than
he
had
ever
known
at
last
there
was
a
groan
from
the
wounded
man
caryll
started
forward
sir
richard
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
looking
about
him
at
the
doctor
the
valet
and
lastly
at
his
adopted
son
he
smiled
faintly
at
the
latter
then
the
doctor
touched
caryll
sleeve
and
drew
him
aside
i
can
not
reach
the
bullet
he
said
but
is
no
matter
for
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
the
lung
has
been
pierced
a
little
time
now
and
i
can
do
nothing
caryll
nodded
in
silence
his
face
drawn
with
pain
with
a
gesture
he
dismissed
the
doctor
who
went
out
with
bentley
when
the
valet
returned
caryll
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
sir
richard
hand
in
his
and
sir
richard
was
speaking
in
a
feeble
hoarse
voice
gasping
and
coughing
at
intervals
do
do
grieve
justin
he
was
saying
i
am
an
old
man
my
time
must
have
been
very
near
i
i
am
glad
that
it
is
thus
it
is
much
better
than
if
they
had
taken
me
they
ha
shown
me
no
mercy
is
swifter
thus
and
and
silently
justin
wrung
the
hand
he
held
you
miss
me
a
little
justin
the
old
man
resumed
presently
we
have
been
good
friends
lad
good
friends
for
thirty
father
justin
cried
a
sob
in
his
voice
sir
richard
smiled
i
would
i
were
your
father
in
more
than
name
justin
hast
been
a
good
son
to
me
no
son
could
have
been
more
than
bentley
drew
nigh
with
a
long
glass
containing
a
cordial
the
doctor
had
advised
sir
richard
drank
avidly
and
sighed
content
when
he
returned
the
glass
how
long
yet
justin
he
inquired
not
long
father
was
the
gloomy
answer
it
is
well
i
am
content
i
am
happy
justin
believe
me
i
am
happy
what
has
my
life
been
dissipated
in
the
pursuit
of
a
he
spoke
musingly
critically
calm
as
one
who
already
upon
the
brink
of
dissolution
takes
already
but
an
impersonal
interest
in
the
course
he
has
run
in
life
judging
so
his
judgment
was
clearer
than
it
had
yet
been
it
grew
sane
and
was
freed
at
last
from
the
hackles
of
fanaticism
and
there
was
something
that
he
saw
in
its
true
proportions
he
sighed
heavily
this
is
a
judgment
upon
me
he
said
presently
he
turned
his
great
eyes
full
upon
justin
and
their
dance
was
infinitely
wistful
do
you
remember
justin
that
night
at
your
lodging
that
first
night
on
which
we
talked
here
in
london
of
the
thing
you
were
come
to
do
the
thing
to
which
i
urged
you
do
you
recall
how
you
upbraided
me
for
having
set
you
a
task
that
was
unworthy
and
revolting
i
remember
answered
justin
with
an
inward
shudder
fearful
of
what
might
follow
oh
you
were
right
justin
right
and
i
was
entirely
wrong
wickedly
wrong
i
should
have
left
vengeance
to
god
he
is
wreaking
it
ostermore
whole
life
has
been
a
punishment
his
end
will
be
a
punishment
i
understand
it
now
we
do
no
wrong
in
life
justin
for
which
in
this
same
life
payment
is
not
exacted
ostermore
has
been
paying
i
should
have
been
content
with
that
after
all
he
is
your
father
in
the
flesh
and
it
was
not
for
you
to
raise
your
hand
against
him
is
what
you
have
felt
and
i
am
glad
you
should
have
felt
it
for
it
proves
your
worthiness
can
you
forgive
me
nay
nay
father
speak
not
of
i
have
sore
need
of
ah
but
not
from
me
not
from
me
what
is
there
i
should
forgive
there
is
a
debt
between
us
i
had
hoped
to
repay
some
day
when
you
were
grown
truly
old
i
had
looked
to
tend
you
in
your
old
age
to
be
the
comfort
of
it
and
the
support
that
you
were
to
my
it
had
been
sweet
justin
sighed
sir
richard
smiling
upon
his
adopted
son
and
putting
forth
an
unsteady
hand
to
stroke
the
white
drawn
face
it
had
been
sweet
it
is
sweet
to
hear
that
you
so
a
shudder
convulsed
him
he
sank
back
coughing
and
there
was
froth
and
blood
on
his
lips
reverently
justin
wiped
them
and
signed
for
the
cordial
to
bentley
who
stood
numbed
in
the
background
it
is
the
end
said
sir
richard
feebly
god
has
been
good
to
me
beyond
my
deserts
and
this
is
a
crowning
mercy
consider
justin
it
might
have
been
the
gibbet
and
a
crowd
instead
of
this
snug
bed
and
you
and
bentley
here
just
two
good
bentley
losing
all
at
this
mention
of
himself
sank
weeping
to
his
knees
sir
richard
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
his
head
you
will
serve
caryll
bentley
you
find
him
a
good
master
if
you
are
as
good
a
servant
to
him
as
you
have
been
to
then
suddenly
he
made
the
quick
movement
of
one
who
bethinks
himself
of
something
he
waved
bentley
away
there
is
a
case
in
the
drawer
yonder
he
said
when
the
servant
was
beyond
earshot
it
contains
papers
that
concern
you
certificates
of
your
birth
and
of
your
mothers
death
i
brought
them
with
me
as
proofs
of
your
identity
against
the
time
when
the
hour
of
vengeance
upon
ostermore
should
strike
they
twill
serve
no
purpose
now
burn
them
they
are
best
caryll
nodded
understanding
and
on
sir
richard
part
there
followed
another
fight
for
breath
another
attack
of
coughing
during
which
bentley
instinctively
approached
again
when
the
paroxysm
was
past
sir
richard
turned
once
more
to
justin
who
was
holding
him
in
his
arms
upright
to
ease
his
breathing
be
good
to
bentley
he
murmured
his
voice
very
faint
and
exhausted
now
you
are
my
heir
justin
all
that
i
have
i
set
all
in
order
ere
i
left
paris
it
it
is
growing
dark
you
have
not
snuffed
the
candles
bentley
they
are
burning
very
suddenly
he
started
forward
held
as
he
was
in
justin
arms
he
his
arms
holding
out
his
hands
toward
the
foot
of
the
bed
his
eyes
dilated
the
expression
of
his
livid
face
grew
first
surprised
then
joyous
beatific
antoinette
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
antoi
and
thus
abruptly
but
in
great
happiness
he
passed
chapter
xvii
amid
the
graves
what
time
sir
richard
had
been
dying
in
the
inner
room
green
and
two
of
his
acolytes
had
improved
the
occasion
by
making
a
thorough
search
in
sir
richard
and
a
thorough
investigation
of
every
scrap
of
paper
found
there
from
which
you
will
understand
how
much
green
was
a
gentleman
who
set
business
above
every
other
consideration
the
man
who
had
shot
sir
richard
had
been
ordered
by
green
to
take
himself
off
and
had
been
urged
to
go
down
on
his
knees
for
once
in
a
way
and
pray
heaven
that
his
rashness
might
not
bring
him
to
the
gallows
as
he
so
richly
deserved
his
fourth
myrmidon
green
had
dispatched
with
a
note
to
my
lord
rotherby
and
it
was
entirely
upon
the
answer
he
should
receive
that
it
must
depend
whether
he
proceeded
or
not
forthwith
to
the
apprehension
of
caryll
meanwhile
the
search
went
on
amain
and
was
extended
presently
to
the
very
bedroom
where
the
dead
sir
richard
lay
every
nook
and
cranny
was
ransacked
the
very
mattress
under
the
dead
man
was
removed
and
investigated
and
even
caryll
and
bentley
had
to
submit
to
being
searched
but
it
all
proved
fruitless
not
a
line
of
treasonable
matter
was
to
be
found
anywhere
to
the
certificates
upon
caryll
the
searcher
made
the
mistake
of
paying
but
little
heed
in
view
of
their
nature
but
if
there
were
no
proofs
of
plots
and
treasonable
dealings
there
was
at
least
abundant
proof
of
sir
richard
identity
and
green
appropriated
these
against
any
awkward
inquiries
touching
the
manner
in
which
the
baronet
had
met
his
death
of
such
inquiries
however
there
were
none
it
was
formally
sworn
to
lord
carteret
by
green
and
his
men
that
the
secretary
messenger
jerry
the
fellow
owned
no
surname
had
shot
sir
richard
in
when
sir
richard
had
produced
firearms
upon
being
arrested
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
for
which
they
held
the
secretary
own
warrant
at
first
lord
carteret
considered
it
a
thousand
pities
that
they
should
not
have
contrived
matters
better
so
as
to
take
sir
richard
alive
but
upon
reflection
he
was
careful
not
to
exaggerate
to
himself
the
loss
occasioned
by
his
death
for
sir
richard
after
all
was
a
notoriously
stubborn
man
not
in
the
least
likely
to
have
made
any
avowals
worth
having
so
that
his
trial
whilst
probably
resulting
sterile
of
such
results
as
the
government
could
desire
would
have
given
publicity
to
the
matter
of
a
plot
that
was
hatching
and
such
publicity
at
a
time
of
so
much
unrest
was
the
last
thing
the
government
desired
where
jacobitism
was
concerned
lord
carteret
had
the
wise
discretion
to
proceed
with
the
extremest
caution
publicity
might
serve
to
fan
the
smouldering
embers
into
a
blaze
whereas
it
was
his
cunning
aim
quietly
to
stifle
them
as
he
came
upon
them
so
upon
the
whole
he
was
by
no
means
sure
but
that
jerry
had
done
the
state
the
best
possible
service
in
disposing
thus
summarily
of
that
notorious
jacobite
agent
sir
richard
everard
and
his
lordship
saw
to
it
that
there
was
no
inquiry
and
that
nothing
further
was
heard
of
the
matter
as
for
lord
rotherby
had
the
affair
transpired
hours
earlier
he
would
certainly
have
returned
green
a
message
to
effect
the
arrest
of
caryll
upon
suspicion
but
as
it
chanced
he
had
that
very
afternoon
received
a
visit
from
his
mother
who
came
in
great
excitement
to
inform
him
that
she
had
forced
from
lord
ostermore
an
acknowledgment
that
he
was
plotting
with
caryll
to
go
over
to
king
james
so
before
they
could
move
further
against
caryll
it
behooved
them
to
ascertain
precisely
to
what
extent
lord
ostermore
might
not
be
incriminated
as
otherwise
the
arrest
of
caryll
might
lead
to
exposures
that
would
ruin
the
earl
more
thoroughly
than
could
any
south
sea
bubble
revelations
thus
her
ladyship
to
her
son
he
turned
upon
her
why
madam
said
he
these
be
the
very
arguments
i
used
day
when
we
talked
of
this
and
all
you
answered
me
then
was
to
call
me
a
clod
for
not
seeing
how
the
thing
might
be
done
without
involving
my
tcha
snapped
her
ladyship
beating
her
knuckles
impatiently
with
her
fan
a
clod
did
i
call
you
was
flattery
sheer
flattery
for
i
think
ye
something
worse
fool
can
ye
not
see
the
difference
that
lies
betwixt
your
disclosing
a
plot
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
causing
this
caryll
to
disclose
it
as
might
happen
if
he
were
seized
first
discover
the
plot
find
out
in
what
it
may
consist
and
then
go
to
lord
carteret
to
make
your
he
looked
at
her
out
of
temper
by
her
rebuke
i
may
be
as
dull
as
your
ladyship
says
but
i
do
not
see
in
what
the
position
now
is
different
from
what
it
it
is
different
but
we
thought
it
was
different
she
explained
impatiently
we
assumed
that
your
father
would
not
have
betrayed
himself
counting
upon
his
characteristic
caution
but
it
seems
we
are
mistook
he
has
betrayed
himself
to
caryll
and
before
we
can
move
in
this
matter
we
must
have
proofs
of
a
plot
to
lay
before
the
secretary
of
lord
rotherby
understood
and
accounted
himself
between
scylla
and
charybdis
and
when
that
evening
green
messenger
found
him
he
gnashed
his
teeth
in
rage
at
having
to
allow
this
chance
to
pass
at
being
forced
to
temporize
until
he
should
be
less
parlously
situated
he
returned
green
an
urgent
message
to
take
no
steps
concerning
caryll
until
they
should
have
concerted
together
green
was
relieved
caryll
arrested
might
stir
up
matters
against
the
slayer
of
sir
richard
and
this
was
a
business
which
green
had
prevision
enough
to
see
his
master
lord
carteret
would
prefer
should
not
be
stirred
up
he
had
a
notion
for
the
rest
that
if
caryll
were
left
to
go
his
ways
he
would
not
be
likely
to
give
trouble
touching
that
same
matter
and
he
was
right
in
this
before
his
overwhelming
sense
of
loss
caryll
had
few
thoughts
to
bestow
upon
the
manner
in
which
that
loss
had
been
sustained
moreover
if
he
had
a
quarrel
with
any
one
on
that
account
it
was
with
the
government
whose
representative
had
issued
the
warrant
for
sir
richard
arrest
and
no
more
with
the
wretched
tipstaff
who
had
fired
the
pistol
than
with
the
pistol
itself
both
alike
were
but
instruments
of
slightly
different
degrees
of
insensibility
for
hours
caryll
grief
was
overwhelming
in
its
poignancy
his
sense
of
solitude
was
awful
gone
was
the
only
living
man
who
had
stood
to
him
for
kith
and
kin
he
was
left
alone
in
the
world
utterly
alone
that
was
the
selfishness
of
his
sorrow
the
consideration
of
sir
richard
death
as
it
concerned
himself
presently
an
alloy
of
consolation
was
supplied
by
the
reflection
of
sir
richard
own
case
as
sir
richard
himself
had
stated
it
upon
his
deathbed
his
life
had
not
been
happy
it
had
been
poisoned
by
a
monomania
which
like
a
worm
in
the
bud
had
consumed
the
sweetness
of
his
existence
sir
richard
was
at
rest
and
since
he
had
been
discovered
that
shot
was
indeed
the
most
merciful
end
that
could
have
been
measured
out
to
him
the
alternative
might
have
been
the
gibbet
and
the
gaping
crowd
and
a
moral
torture
to
precede
the
end
better
a
thousand
times
better
as
it
was
so
much
did
all
this
weigh
with
him
that
when
on
the
following
monday
he
accompanied
the
body
to
its
grave
he
found
his
erstwhile
passionate
grief
succeeded
by
an
odd
thankfulness
that
things
were
as
they
were
although
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
pang
of
returning
anguish
smote
him
when
he
heard
the
earth
clattering
down
upon
the
wooden
box
that
held
all
that
remained
of
the
man
who
had
been
father
mother
brother
and
all
else
to
him
he
turned
away
at
last
and
was
leaving
the
graveyard
when
some
one
touched
him
on
the
arm
it
was
a
timid
touch
he
turned
sharply
and
found
himself
looking
into
the
sweet
face
of
hortensia
winthrop
wondering
how
came
she
there
she
wore
a
long
dark
cloak
and
hood
but
her
veil
was
turned
back
a
chair
was
waiting
not
fifty
paces
from
them
along
the
churchyard
wall
i
came
but
to
tell
you
how
much
i
feel
for
you
in
this
great
loss
she
said
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
how
did
you
know
he
asked
her
i
guessed
said
she
i
heard
that
you
were
with
him
at
the
end
and
i
caught
stray
words
from
her
ladyship
of
what
had
passed
lord
rotherby
had
the
information
from
the
tipstaff
who
went
to
arrest
sir
richard
everard
i
guessed
he
was
your
your
as
you
called
him
and
i
came
to
tell
you
how
deeply
i
sorrow
for
you
in
your
he
caught
her
hands
in
his
and
bore
them
to
his
lips
reckless
of
who
might
see
the
act
ah
this
is
sweet
and
kind
in
you
said
he
she
drew
him
back
into
the
churchyard
again
along
the
wall
there
was
an
avenue
of
limes
a
cool
and
pleasant
walk
wherein
idlers
lounged
on
sundays
in
summer
after
service
thither
she
drew
him
he
went
almost
mechanically
her
sympathy
stirred
his
sorrow
again
as
sympathy
so
often
does
i
have
buried
my
heart
yonder
i
think
said
he
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
that
spot
amid
the
graves
where
the
men
were
toiling
with
their
shovels
he
was
the
only
living
being
that
loved
ah
surely
not
said
she
sorrow
rather
than
reproach
in
her
gentle
voice
indeed
yes
mine
is
a
selfish
grief
it
is
for
myself
that
i
sorrow
for
myself
and
my
own
loneliness
it
is
thus
with
all
of
us
when
we
argue
that
we
weep
the
dead
it
would
be
more
true
to
say
that
we
bewail
the
living
for
him
it
is
better
as
it
is
no
doubt
it
is
better
so
for
most
men
when
all
is
said
and
we
do
wrong
to
weep
their
do
not
talk
so
she
said
it
ay
it
is
the
way
of
truth
to
hurt
which
is
why
hating
pain
we
shun
truth
so
he
sighed
but
oh
it
was
good
in
you
to
seek
me
to
bring
me
word
with
your
own
lips
of
your
sweet
sympathy
if
aught
could
lighten
the
gloom
of
my
sorrow
surely
it
is
they
stepped
along
in
silence
until
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
turned
it
was
no
idle
silence
the
silence
of
two
beings
who
have
naught
to
say
it
was
a
grave
portentous
silence
occasioned
by
the
unutterable
much
in
the
mind
of
one
and
by
the
other
apprehension
of
it
at
last
she
spoke
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
to
do
i
shall
return
to
france
he
said
it
had
perhaps
been
better
had
i
never
crossed
to
i
can
not
think
so
she
said
simply
frankly
and
with
no
touch
of
a
coquetry
that
had
been
harshly
at
discord
with
time
and
place
he
shot
her
a
swift
sidelong
glance
then
stopped
and
turned
i
am
glad
o
said
he
make
my
going
the
i
mean
not
that
she
cried
and
held
out
her
hands
to
him
i
meant
not
what
you
think
you
know
you
know
what
was
i
meant
you
know
you
must
what
impulse
brought
me
to
you
in
this
hour
when
i
knew
you
must
need
comfort
and
in
return
how
cruel
were
you
not
to
tell
me
that
yonder
lay
buried
the
only
living
being
that
that
loved
you
his
fingers
were
clenched
upon
her
arm
do
do
he
implored
hoarsely
a
strange
fire
in
his
eyes
a
hectic
flush
on
either
cheek
do
or
i
forget
what
i
am
and
take
advantage
of
this
midsummer
folly
that
is
upon
is
it
no
more
than
folly
justin
she
asked
him
brown
eyes
looking
up
into
ay
something
more
stark
madness
all
great
emotions
are
it
will
pass
and
you
will
be
thankful
that
i
was
man
enough
strong
enough
to
allow
it
the
chance
of
she
hung
her
head
shaking
it
sorrowfully
then
very
softly
is
it
no
more
than
the
matter
of
of
that
that
stands
between
us
she
inquired
no
more
than
that
he
answered
and
yet
more
than
enough
i
have
no
name
to
offer
any
a
name
she
echoed
scornfully
what
store
do
you
think
i
lay
by
that
when
you
talk
so
you
obey
some
foolish
prejudice
no
obedience
to
prejudices
is
the
whole
art
of
living
he
answered
sighing
she
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
went
on
justin
you
said
you
loved
me
and
when
you
said
so
much
you
gave
me
the
right
or
so
i
understood
it
to
speak
to
you
as
i
am
doing
now
you
are
alone
in
the
world
without
kith
or
kin
the
only
one
you
had
the
one
who
represented
all
for
you
lies
buried
there
would
you
return
thus
lonely
and
alone
to
france
ah
now
i
understand
he
cried
now
i
understand
pity
is
the
impulse
that
has
urged
you
pity
for
my
loneliness
not
hortensia
i
not
deny
that
without
the
pity
there
might
not
have
been
the
courage
why
should
i
since
it
is
a
pity
that
gives
you
no
offense
a
pity
that
is
rooted
firmly
in
in
love
for
you
my
justin
he
set
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
and
with
glowing
eyes
regarded
her
ah
sweet
said
he
you
make
me
very
very
and
then
his
arms
dropped
again
limply
to
his
sides
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head
drearily
and
yet
reflect
when
i
come
to
beg
your
hand
in
marriage
of
your
guardian
what
shall
i
answer
him
of
the
questions
he
will
ask
me
of
myself
touching
my
family
my
parentage
and
all
the
rest
that
he
will
crave
to
know
she
observed
that
he
was
very
white
again
need
you
enter
into
that
a
man
is
himself
not
his
father
or
his
and
then
she
checked
you
make
me
plead
too
much
she
said
a
crimson
flood
in
her
fair
cheeks
i
say
no
more
than
i
have
said
already
have
i
said
more
than
i
intended
and
you
have
wanted
mercy
that
you
could
drive
me
to
it
you
know
my
mind
my
my
inmost
heart
you
know
that
i
care
nothing
for
your
namelessness
it
is
yours
to
decide
what
you
will
do
come
now
my
chair
is
staying
for
he
bowed
he
sought
again
to
convey
some
sense
of
his
appreciation
of
her
great
nobility
then
led
her
through
the
gate
and
to
her
waiting
chair
whatever
i
may
decide
hortensia
was
the
last
thing
he
said
to
her
and
i
shall
decide
as
i
account
best
for
you
rather
than
for
myself
and
for
myself
there
needs
no
thought
or
hesitation
whatever
i
may
decide
believe
me
when
i
say
from
my
soul
that
all
my
life
shall
be
the
sweeter
for
this
chapter
xviii
the
ghost
of
the
past
temptation
had
seized
caryll
in
a
throttling
grip
and
for
two
whole
days
he
kept
the
house
shunning
all
company
and
wrestling
with
that
same
temptation
in
the
end
he
took
a
whimsical
resolve
entirely
worthy
of
himself
he
would
go
to
lord
ostermore
formally
to
ask
in
marriage
the
hand
of
mistress
winthrop
and
he
would
be
entirely
frank
with
the
earl
stating
his
exact
condition
but
suppressing
the
names
of
his
parents
he
was
greatly
taken
with
the
notion
it
would
create
a
situation
ironical
beyond
any
grotesque
beyond
belief
and
its
development
should
be
stupendously
interesting
it
attracted
him
irresistibly
that
he
should
leave
it
to
his
own
father
to
say
whether
a
man
born
as
he
was
born
might
aspire
to
marry
his
father
ward
had
in
it
something
that
savored
of
it
was
a
pretty
problem
that
once
set
could
not
be
left
unsolved
by
a
man
of
caryll
temperament
and
indeed
no
sooner
was
the
idea
conceived
than
it
quickened
into
a
resolve
upon
which
he
set
out
to
act
he
bade
leduc
call
a
chair
and
dressed
in
mourning
but
with
his
habitual
care
he
had
himself
carried
to
lincoln
inn
fields
engrossed
as
he
was
in
his
own
thoughts
he
paid
little
heed
to
the
hum
of
excitement
about
the
threshold
of
stretton
house
within
the
railed
enclosure
that
fronted
the
mansion
two
coaches
were
drawn
up
and
a
little
knot
of
idlers
stood
by
one
of
these
in
busy
gossip
paying
no
attention
to
them
caryll
mounted
the
steps
nor
noticed
the
gravity
of
the
porter
countenance
as
he
passed
within
in
the
hall
he
found
a
little
flock
of
servants
gathered
together
and
muttering
among
themselves
like
conspirators
in
a
tragedy
and
so
engrossed
that
they
paid
no
heed
to
him
as
he
advanced
nor
until
he
had
tapped
one
of
them
on
the
shoulder
with
his
cane
and
tapped
him
a
thought
peremptorily
how
now
said
he
does
no
one
wait
here
they
fell
apart
a
little
and
stood
at
attention
with
something
curious
in
their
bearing
one
and
all
my
service
to
his
lordship
and
say
that
i
desire
to
speak
with
they
looked
at
one
another
in
hesitation
for
a
moment
then
humphries
the
butler
came
forward
your
honor
not
have
heard
the
news
said
he
a
solemn
gravity
in
face
and
tone
news
quoth
caryll
sharply
intrigued
by
so
much
show
of
mystery
what
news
his
lordship
is
very
ill
sir
he
had
a
seizure
this
morning
when
they
came
for
a
seizure
said
caryll
and
then
when
they
came
for
him
he
echoed
struck
by
something
odd
in
the
man
utterance
of
those
five
words
when
who
came
for
him
the
messengers
sir
replied
the
butler
dejectedly
has
your
honor
not
heard
and
seeing
the
blank
look
on
caryll
face
he
proceeded
without
waiting
for
an
answer
his
lordship
was
impeached
yesterday
by
his
grace
of
wharton
on
a
matter
concerning
the
south
sea
company
and
lord
carteret
the
secretary
of
state
your
honor
sent
this
morning
to
arrest
ejaculated
caryll
in
his
surprise
a
surprise
that
was
tempered
with
some
dismay
and
he
had
a
seizure
ye
say
an
apoplexy
your
honor
the
doctors
are
with
him
now
sir
james
himself
is
here
they
cupping
him
so
i
hear
from
tom
his
lordship
man
i
ha
thought
your
honor
would
ha
heard
is
town
talk
they
caryll
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
have
said
exactly
what
impression
this
news
made
upon
him
in
the
main
however
he
feared
it
left
him
cold
is
very
regrettable
said
he
he
fell
thoughtful
a
moment
then
will
you
send
word
to
mistress
winthrop
that
i
am
here
and
would
speak
with
her
humphries
humphries
conducted
caryll
to
the
little
white
and
gold
that
was
hortensia
there
in
the
little
time
that
he
waited
he
revolved
the
situation
as
it
now
stood
and
the
temptation
that
had
been
with
him
for
the
past
three
days
rose
up
now
with
a
greater
vigor
should
lord
ostermore
die
temptation
argued
he
need
no
longer
hesitate
hortensia
would
be
as
much
alone
in
the
world
as
he
was
worse
for
life
at
stretton
house
with
her
ladyship
from
which
even
in
the
earl
lifetime
she
had
been
led
to
attempt
to
escape
must
be
a
thing
unbearable
and
what
alternative
could
he
suggest
but
that
she
should
become
his
wife
she
came
to
him
presently
and
with
startled
eyes
as
she
took
his
outstretched
hands
she
attempted
a
smile
it
is
kind
in
you
to
come
to
me
at
such
a
time
she
said
you
mistake
said
he
as
is
but
natural
i
had
not
heard
what
had
befallen
i
came
to
ask
your
hand
in
marriage
of
his
some
faint
color
tinged
her
cheeks
you
had
decided
then
i
had
decided
that
his
lordship
must
decide
he
answered
and
now
and
now
it
seems
we
must
decide
for
ourselves
if
his
lordship
her
mind
swung
to
the
graver
matter
sir
james
has
every
hope
she
said
and
added
miserably
i
know
not
which
to
pray
for
his
recovery
or
his
why
that
because
if
he
survive
it
may
be
for
worse
the
secretary
agent
is
even
now
seeking
evidence
against
him
among
his
own
papers
he
is
in
the
library
at
this
moment
going
through
his
lordship
caryll
started
that
mention
of
ostermore
desk
brought
vividly
before
his
mind
the
recollection
of
the
secret
drawer
wherein
the
earl
had
locked
away
the
letter
he
had
received
from
king
james
and
his
own
reply
all
packed
as
it
was
with
treason
if
that
drawer
were
discovered
and
those
papers
found
then
was
ostermore
lost
indeed
and
did
he
survive
this
apoplexy
it
would
be
to
surrender
his
head
upon
the
scaffold
a
moment
he
considered
this
dispassionately
then
it
broke
upon
his
mind
that
were
this
to
happen
ostermore
blood
would
indirectly
be
upon
his
own
head
since
for
the
purpose
of
betrayal
had
he
sought
him
out
with
that
letter
from
the
exiled
stuart
which
be
it
remembered
king
james
himself
had
no
longer
wished
delivered
it
turned
him
cold
with
horror
he
could
not
remain
idle
and
let
matters
run
their
course
he
must
avert
these
discoveries
if
it
lay
within
his
power
to
do
so
or
else
he
must
submit
to
a
lifetime
of
remorse
should
ostermore
survive
to
be
attainted
of
treason
he
had
made
an
end
a
definite
end
long
since
of
his
intention
of
working
ostermore
ruin
he
could
not
stand
by
now
and
see
that
ruin
wrought
as
a
result
of
the
little
that
already
he
had
done
towards
encompassing
it
his
papers
must
be
saved
he
said
shortly
i
go
to
the
library
at
but
the
secretary
agent
is
there
already
she
repeated
is
no
matter
for
that
said
he
moving
towards
the
door
his
desk
contains
that
which
will
cost
him
his
head
if
discovered
i
know
it
he
assured
her
and
left
her
cold
with
fear
but
then
you
you
she
cried
is
it
true
that
you
are
a
jacobite
true
enough
he
answered
lord
rotherby
knows
it
she
informed
him
he
told
me
it
was
so
if
if
you
interfere
in
this
it
it
may
mean
your
she
came
to
him
swiftly
a
great
fear
written
or
her
winsome
face
sh
said
he
i
am
not
concerned
to
think
of
that
at
present
if
lord
ostermore
perishes
through
his
connection
with
the
cause
it
will
mean
worse
than
ruin
for
me
though
not
the
ruin
that
you
are
thinking
but
what
can
you
do
that
i
go
to
i
will
come
with
you
he
hesitated
a
moment
looking
at
her
then
he
opened
the
door
and
held
it
for
her
following
after
he
led
the
way
across
the
hall
to
the
library
and
they
went
in
together
lord
ostermore
secretaire
stood
open
and
leaning
over
it
his
back
towards
them
was
a
short
man
in
a
coat
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
and
revealed
the
pleasant
chubby
face
of
green
ha
said
caryll
mr
green
again
i
declare
sir
ye
the
gift
of
the
spy
stood
up
to
regard
him
and
for
all
that
his
voice
inclined
to
sharpness
when
he
spoke
the
habitual
grin
sat
like
a
mask
upon
the
mobile
features
what
d
seek
here
tis
what
i
was
about
to
ask
you
what
you
are
seeking
for
that
you
seek
is
plain
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
assist
i
nothing
doubt
you
could
answered
green
with
a
fresh
leer
that
contained
this
time
something
ironic
i
nothing
doubt
it
but
by
your
leave
i
pursue
my
quest
without
your
caryll
continued
nevertheless
to
advance
towards
him
mistress
hortensia
remaining
in
the
background
a
quiet
spectator
betraying
nothing
of
the
anxieties
by
which
she
was
being
racked
ye
mighty
curt
this
morning
green
said
caryll
very
airy
ye
mighty
curt
and
ye
entirely
wrong
so
to
be
you
might
find
me
a
very
useful
i
found
you
so
before
said
green
sourly
ye
a
nice
sense
of
humor
said
caryll
head
on
one
side
contemplating
the
spy
with
admiration
in
his
glance
and
a
nicer
sense
of
a
jacobite
answered
green
he
will
have
the
last
word
you
perceive
said
caryll
to
hortensia
harkee
caryll
quoth
green
quite
grimly
now
i
ha
laid
you
by
the
heels
a
month
or
more
ago
but
for
certain
friends
o
mine
who
have
other
ends
to
sir
what
you
tell
me
shocks
me
it
shakes
the
very
foundations
of
my
faith
in
human
nature
i
have
esteemed
you
an
honest
man
green
and
it
seems
on
your
own
confessing
that
ye
no
better
than
a
damned
rogue
who
neglects
his
duty
to
the
state
i
a
mind
to
see
lord
carteret
and
tell
him
the
truth
of
the
ye
shall
have
an
opportunity
before
long
ecod
said
green
to
you
i
work
to
and
he
turned
back
to
the
desk
is
wasted
labor
said
caryll
producing
his
and
tapping
it
you
might
seek
from
now
till
the
crack
of
doom
and
not
find
what
ye
seek
not
though
you
hack
the
desk
to
pieces
it
has
a
secret
green
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
for
that
green
turned
again
and
his
shrewd
bright
eyes
scanned
more
closely
that
lean
face
whose
keenness
was
all
dissembled
now
in
an
easy
languid
smile
a
bargain
grumbled
the
spy
i
faith
then
the
secret
ye
think
that
pho
is
not
like
your
usual
wit
green
the
letter
that
i
carried
into
england
and
that
you
were
at
such
splendid
pains
to
find
at
maidstone
is
in
and
he
tapped
the
veneered
top
of
the
secretaire
with
his
forefinger
but
ye
not
find
it
without
my
help
it
is
concealed
as
effectively
as
effectively
as
it
was
upon
my
person
when
ye
searched
me
now
sir
will
ye
treat
with
me
it
save
you
a
world
of
green
still
looked
at
him
he
licked
his
lips
thoughtfully
what
terms
d
make
he
inquired
but
his
tone
was
very
cold
his
busy
brain
was
endeavoring
to
conjecture
what
exactly
might
be
caryll
object
in
this
frankness
which
green
was
not
fool
enough
to
believe
sincere
ah
said
caryll
that
is
more
the
man
i
he
tapped
his
and
in
that
moment
memory
rather
than
inspiration
showed
him
the
thing
he
needed
did
ye
ever
see
constant
couple
green
he
inquired
constant
couple
echoed
green
and
though
mystified
he
must
air
his
little
jest
i
never
saw
any
couple
that
was
constant
leastways
not
for
ha
ye
a
roguish
wag
but
constant
couple
i
mean
is
a
oh
a
play
ay
i
mind
me
i
saw
it
some
years
ago
when
was
first
acted
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
ye
understand
in
a
moment
said
caryll
with
a
smile
the
spy
did
not
relish
d
recall
a
ruse
of
sir
harry
wildairs
to
rid
himself
of
the
company
of
an
intrusive
old
fool
who
was
not
wanted
d
remember
what
was
he
did
green
his
head
slightly
on
one
side
was
watching
caryll
very
closely
and
not
without
anxiety
i
do
said
he
and
dropped
a
hand
to
the
pocket
where
a
pistol
lay
that
he
might
be
prepared
for
emergencies
what
did
he
do
i
show
you
said
caryll
he
did
and
with
a
swift
upward
movement
he
emptied
his
full
into
the
face
of
green
green
leapt
back
with
a
scream
of
pain
hands
to
his
eyes
and
quite
unconsciously
set
himself
to
play
to
the
life
the
part
of
the
intrusive
old
fellow
in
the
comedy
dancing
wildly
about
the
room
his
eyes
smarting
and
burning
so
that
he
could
not
open
them
he
bellowed
of
and
other
hot
things
of
which
he
was
being
so
intensely
reminded
pass
caryll
consoled
him
a
little
water
and
all
will
be
well
with
he
stepped
to
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
flung
it
open
ho
there
who
waits
he
called
two
or
three
footmen
sprang
to
answer
him
he
took
green
still
blind
and
vociferous
by
the
shoulders
and
thrust
him
into
their
care
this
gentleman
has
had
a
most
unfortunate
accident
get
him
water
to
wash
his
eyes
warm
water
so
take
him
pass
green
soon
pass
i
assure
he
shut
the
door
upon
them
locked
it
and
turned
to
hortensia
smiling
grimly
then
he
crossed
quickly
to
the
desk
and
hortensia
followed
him
he
sat
down
and
pulled
out
bodily
the
bottom
drawer
on
the
right
inside
of
the
upper
part
of
the
desk
as
he
had
seen
lord
ostermore
do
that
day
a
little
over
a
week
ago
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
opening
and
felt
along
the
sides
for
some
moments
in
vain
he
went
over
the
ground
again
slowly
inch
by
inch
exerting
constant
pressure
until
he
was
suddenly
rewarded
by
a
click
the
small
trap
disclosed
itself
he
pulled
it
up
and
took
some
papers
from
the
recess
he
spread
them
before
him
they
were
the
documents
he
sought
the
king
letter
to
ostermore
and
ostermore
reply
signed
and
ready
for
dispatch
these
must
be
burnt
he
said
and
burnt
at
once
for
that
fellow
green
may
return
or
he
may
send
others
call
humphries
get
a
taper
from
she
sped
to
the
door
and
did
his
bidding
then
she
returned
she
was
plainly
agitated
you
must
go
at
once
she
said
imploringly
you
must
return
to
france
without
an
instant
why
indeed
it
would
mean
my
ruin
to
remain
now
he
admitted
and
yet
he
held
out
his
hands
to
her
i
will
follow
you
she
promised
him
i
will
follow
you
as
soon
as
his
lordship
is
recovered
or
or
at
you
have
well
considered
sweetheart
he
asked
her
holding
her
to
him
and
looking
down
into
her
gentle
eyes
there
is
no
happiness
for
me
apart
from
again
his
scruples
took
him
tell
lord
ostermore
tell
him
all
he
begged
her
be
guided
by
him
his
decision
for
you
will
represent
the
decision
of
the
what
is
the
world
to
me
you
are
the
world
to
me
she
cried
there
was
a
rap
upon
the
door
he
put
her
from
him
and
went
to
open
it
was
humphries
with
a
lighted
taper
he
took
it
thanked
the
man
with
a
word
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
fellow
was
attempting
to
tell
him
something
he
returned
to
the
desk
let
us
make
quite
sure
that
this
is
all
he
said
and
held
the
taper
so
that
the
light
shone
into
the
recess
it
seemed
empty
at
first
then
as
the
light
penetrated
farther
he
saw
something
that
showed
white
at
the
back
of
the
cachette
he
thrust
in
his
hand
and
drew
out
a
small
package
bound
with
a
ribbon
that
once
might
have
been
green
but
was
faded
now
to
yellow
he
set
it
on
the
desk
and
returned
to
his
search
there
was
nothing
else
the
recess
was
empty
he
closed
the
trap
and
replaced
the
drawer
then
he
sat
down
again
the
taper
at
his
elbow
mistress
winthrop
looking
on
facing
him
across
the
top
of
the
secretaire
and
he
took
up
the
package
the
ribbon
came
away
easily
and
some
sheets
fell
out
and
scattered
upon
the
desk
they
gave
out
a
curious
perfume
half
of
age
half
of
some
essence
with
which
years
ago
they
had
been
imbued
something
took
caryll
in
the
throat
and
he
could
never
explain
whether
it
was
that
perfume
or
some
premonitory
emotion
some
prophetic
apprehension
of
what
he
was
about
to
see
he
opened
the
first
of
those
folded
sheets
and
found
it
to
be
a
letter
written
in
french
and
in
an
ink
that
had
paled
to
yellow
with
the
years
that
were
gone
since
it
had
been
penned
the
fine
pointed
writing
was
curiously
familiar
to
caryll
he
looked
at
the
signature
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
it
swam
before
his
eyes
celle
qui
antoinette
he
read
and
the
whole
world
seemed
blotted
out
for
him
all
consciousness
his
whole
being
his
every
sense
seemed
concentrated
into
his
eyes
as
they
gazed
upon
that
relic
of
a
deluded
woman
dream
he
did
not
read
it
was
not
for
him
to
commit
the
sacrilege
of
reading
what
that
girl
who
had
been
his
mother
had
written
thirty
years
ago
to
the
man
she
loved
the
man
who
had
proved
false
as
hell
he
turned
the
other
letters
over
opened
them
one
by
one
to
make
sure
that
they
were
of
the
same
nature
as
the
first
and
what
time
he
did
so
he
found
himself
speculating
upon
the
strangeness
of
ostermore
having
so
treasured
them
perhaps
he
had
thrust
them
into
that
secret
recess
and
there
forgotten
them
was
an
explanation
that
sorted
better
with
what
caryll
knew
of
his
father
than
the
supposition
that
so
dull
and
practical
and
a
nature
could
have
been
irradiated
by
a
gleam
of
such
tenderness
as
the
hoarding
of
those
letters
might
have
argued
he
continued
to
turn
them
over
forgetful
of
the
urgent
need
to
burn
the
treasonable
documents
he
had
secured
forgetful
of
everything
even
hortensia
presence
and
meantime
she
watched
him
in
silence
marvelling
at
this
delay
and
still
more
at
the
gray
look
that
had
crept
into
his
face
what
have
you
found
she
asked
at
last
a
ghost
he
answered
and
his
voice
had
a
strained
metallic
ring
he
even
vented
an
odd
laugh
a
bundle
of
old
from
her
ladyship
her
ladyship
he
looked
up
an
expression
on
his
face
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
could
not
at
the
moment
think
who
her
ladyship
might
be
then
as
the
picture
of
that
bedaubed
bedizened
and
jezebel
arose
in
his
mind
to
stand
beside
the
sweet
girl
image
of
his
mother
as
he
knew
her
from
the
portrait
that
hung
at
maligny
he
laughed
again
no
not
from
her
ladyship
said
he
from
a
woman
who
loved
him
years
and
he
turned
to
the
seventh
and
last
of
those
poor
seventh
a
fateful
number
he
spread
it
before
him
frowned
down
on
it
a
moment
with
a
sharp
hiss
of
indrawn
breath
then
he
twisted
oddly
on
his
chair
and
sat
bolt
upright
staring
straight
before
him
with
unseeing
eyes
presently
he
passed
a
hand
across
his
brow
and
made
a
queer
sound
in
his
throat
what
is
it
she
asked
but
he
did
not
answer
he
was
staring
at
the
paper
again
a
while
he
sat
thus
then
with
swift
fevered
fingers
he
took
up
once
more
the
other
letters
he
unfolded
one
and
began
to
read
a
few
lines
he
read
and
then
o
god
he
cried
and
flung
out
his
arms
under
stress
of
emotions
one
of
them
caught
the
taper
that
stood
upon
the
desk
and
swept
it
extinguished
to
the
floor
he
never
heeded
it
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
fetched
a
purpose
not
yet
served
he
rose
he
was
white
as
the
dead
are
white
and
she
observed
that
he
was
trembling
he
took
up
the
bundle
of
old
letters
and
thrust
them
into
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
seeking
at
last
to
arouse
him
from
the
spell
under
which
he
appeared
to
have
fallen
those
letters
i
must
see
lord
ostermore
he
answered
wildly
and
made
for
the
door
reeling
like
a
drunkard
in
his
walk
chapter
xix
the
end
of
lord
ostermore
in
the
communicating
with
lord
ostermore
bedroom
the
countess
was
in
consultation
with
rotherby
who
had
been
summoned
by
his
mother
when
my
lord
was
stricken
her
ladyship
occupied
the
rotherby
stood
beside
her
leaning
slightly
against
the
frame
of
the
open
window
their
conversation
was
earnest
and
conducted
in
a
low
key
and
one
would
naturally
have
conjectured
that
it
had
for
subject
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
earl
and
so
it
had
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
earl
political
if
not
physical
affairs
to
her
ladyship
and
her
son
the
matter
of
their
own
future
was
of
greater
gravity
than
the
matter
of
whether
his
lordship
lived
or
died
which
whatever
it
may
be
is
not
unreasonable
since
the
impeachment
of
my
lord
and
the
coming
of
the
messengers
to
arrest
him
the
danger
of
ruin
and
beggary
were
become
more
imminent
indeed
they
impended
and
measures
must
be
concerted
to
avert
these
evils
by
comparison
with
that
the
earl
succumbing
or
surviving
was
a
trivial
matter
and
the
concern
they
had
manifested
in
sir
james
news
when
the
important
physician
who
had
bled
his
lordship
came
to
inform
them
that
there
was
hope
was
outward
only
and
assumed
for
pure
decorum
sake
whether
he
lives
or
dies
said
the
viscount
pertinently
after
the
doctor
had
departed
to
return
to
his
patient
the
measures
to
be
taken
are
the
and
he
repeated
the
substance
of
their
earlier
discussions
upon
this
same
topic
if
we
can
but
secure
the
evidence
of
his
treason
with
caryll
he
wound
up
i
shall
be
able
to
make
terms
with
lord
carteret
to
arrest
the
proceedings
the
government
may
intend
and
thus
avert
the
restitution
it
would
otherwise
but
if
he
were
to
die
said
her
ladyship
as
coldly
horribly
calculating
as
though
he
were
none
of
hers
there
would
be
an
end
to
this
danger
they
could
not
demand
restitution
of
the
dead
nor
impose
fines
upon
rotherby
shook
his
head
believe
not
that
madam
said
he
they
can
demand
restitution
of
his
heirs
and
impose
their
fines
upon
the
estate
was
done
in
the
case
of
chancellor
craggs
though
he
shot
she
raised
a
haggard
face
to
his
and
do
you
dream
that
lord
carteret
would
make
terms
with
you
if
i
can
show
him
by
actual
proof
that
a
conspiracy
does
exist
that
the
stuart
supporters
are
plotting
a
rising
proof
of
that
should
be
of
value
to
lord
carteret
of
sufficient
value
to
the
government
to
warrant
the
payment
of
the
paltry
price
i
ask
that
the
impeachment
against
my
father
for
his
dealings
with
the
south
sea
company
shall
not
be
allowed
but
it
might
involve
the
worse
betrayal
of
your
father
charles
and
if
he
were
to
live
mother
why
must
you
harp
on
that
i
the
fool
you
think
me
he
cried
i
shall
make
it
a
further
condition
that
my
father
have
immunity
there
will
be
no
lack
of
victims
once
the
plot
is
disclosed
and
they
may
begin
upon
that
coxcomb
caryll
the
damned
meddler
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
she
sat
bemused
her
eyes
upon
the
sunlit
gardens
below
where
a
faint
breeze
was
stirring
the
shrub
tops
there
is
she
said
presently
a
secret
drawer
somewhere
in
his
desk
if
he
has
papers
they
will
no
doubt
be
there
had
you
not
best
be
making
search
for
them
he
smiled
darkly
i
have
seen
to
that
already
he
replied
how
excitedly
you
have
got
the
papers
no
but
i
have
set
an
experienced
hand
to
find
them
and
one
moreover
who
has
the
right
by
virtue
of
his
warrant
the
messenger
of
the
secretary
of
she
sat
up
rigid
what
ye
mean
no
need
for
alarm
he
reassured
her
this
fellow
green
is
in
my
pay
as
well
as
in
the
secretary
and
it
will
profit
him
most
to
keep
faith
with
me
he
a
dog
content
to
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
so
that
there
be
profit
in
it
and
he
sacrifice
his
ears
to
bring
caryll
to
the
gallows
i
have
promised
him
that
and
a
thousand
pounds
if
we
save
the
estates
from
she
looked
at
him
between
wonder
and
fear
can
ye
trust
him
she
asked
breathlessly
he
laughed
softly
and
confidently
i
can
trust
him
to
earn
a
thousand
pounds
he
answered
when
he
heard
of
the
impeachment
he
used
such
influence
as
he
has
to
be
entrusted
with
the
arrest
of
his
lordship
and
having
obtained
his
warrant
he
came
first
to
me
to
tell
me
of
it
a
thousand
pounds
is
the
price
of
him
body
and
soul
i
bade
him
seek
not
only
evidence
of
my
lord
having
received
that
plaguey
stock
but
also
papers
relating
to
this
jacobite
plot
into
which
his
lordship
has
been
drawn
by
our
friend
caryll
he
is
at
his
work
at
present
and
i
shall
hear
from
him
when
it
is
she
nodded
slowly
thoughtfully
you
have
very
well
disposed
charles
she
approved
him
if
your
father
lives
it
should
not
be
a
difficult
matter
she
checked
suddenly
and
turned
while
rotherby
too
looked
up
and
stepped
quickly
from
the
where
he
had
stood
the
door
of
the
bedroom
had
been
suddenly
pulled
open
and
sir
james
came
out
very
pale
and
discomposed
madam
your
ladyship
my
lord
he
gasped
his
mouth
working
his
hands
waving
foolishly
the
countess
rose
to
confront
him
tall
severe
and
harsh
the
viscount
scowled
a
question
sir
james
quailed
before
them
evidently
in
affliction
madam
his
lordship
he
said
and
by
his
eloquent
gesture
of
dejection
announced
what
he
had
some
difficulty
in
putting
into
words
she
stepped
forward
and
took
him
by
the
wrist
is
he
dying
she
inquired
have
courage
madam
the
doctor
besought
her
the
apparent
irrelevancy
of
the
request
at
such
a
moment
angered
her
her
mood
was
dangerously
testy
and
had
the
doctor
but
known
it
sympathy
was
a
thing
she
had
not
borne
well
these
many
years
i
asked
you
was
he
dying
she
reminded
him
with
a
cold
sternness
that
beat
aside
all
his
attempts
at
subterfuge
your
ladyship
he
is
dead
he
faltered
with
lowered
eyes
dead
she
echoed
dully
and
her
hand
went
to
the
region
of
her
heart
her
face
turned
livid
under
its
rouge
dead
she
said
again
and
behind
her
rotherby
echoed
the
dread
word
in
a
stupor
almost
equal
to
her
own
her
lips
moved
to
speak
but
no
words
came
she
staggered
where
she
stood
and
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
her
son
arms
were
quickly
about
her
he
supported
her
to
a
chair
where
she
sank
as
if
all
her
joints
were
loosened
sir
james
flew
for
restoratives
bathed
her
brow
with
a
dampened
handkerchief
held
strong
salts
to
her
nostrils
and
murmured
words
of
foolish
banal
consolation
whilst
rotherby
in
a
condition
stunned
by
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
stood
beside
her
mechanically
lending
his
assistance
and
supporting
her
gradually
she
mastered
her
agitation
it
was
odd
that
she
should
feel
so
much
at
losing
what
she
valued
so
little
leastways
it
would
have
been
odd
had
it
been
that
it
was
not
it
was
something
more
in
the
awful
august
presence
of
death
stepped
so
suddenly
into
their
midst
she
felt
herself
appalled
for
nigh
upon
thirty
years
she
had
been
bound
by
legal
and
churchly
ties
in
a
loveless
union
with
lord
ostermore
married
for
the
handsome
portion
that
had
been
hers
a
portion
which
he
had
gamed
away
and
squandered
until
for
their
station
their
circumstances
were
now
absolutely
straitened
they
had
led
a
harsh
discordant
life
and
the
coming
of
a
son
which
should
have
bridged
the
loveless
gulf
between
them
seemed
but
to
have
served
to
dig
it
wider
and
the
son
had
been
just
the
harsh
unfeeling
offspring
that
might
be
looked
for
from
such
a
union
thirty
years
of
slavery
had
been
her
ladyship
and
in
those
thirty
years
her
nature
had
been
soured
and
warped
and
what
inherent
sweetness
it
may
once
have
known
had
long
since
been
smothered
and
destroyed
she
had
no
cause
to
love
that
man
who
had
never
loved
her
never
loved
aught
of
hers
beyond
her
jointure
and
yet
there
was
the
habit
of
thirty
years
for
thirty
years
they
had
been
however
detestable
the
yoke
but
yesterday
he
had
been
alive
and
strong
a
stupid
querulous
thing
maybe
but
a
living
and
now
he
was
so
much
carrion
that
should
be
given
to
the
earth
in
some
such
channel
ran
her
ladyship
reflections
during
those
few
seconds
in
which
she
was
recovering
for
an
instant
she
was
softened
the
springs
of
tenderness
seemed
like
to
push
anew
under
the
shock
of
this
event
she
put
out
a
hand
to
take
her
son
charles
she
said
and
surprised
him
by
the
tender
note
a
moment
thus
then
she
was
herself
again
how
did
he
die
she
asked
the
doctor
and
the
abruptness
of
the
resumption
of
her
usual
manner
startled
sir
james
more
than
aught
in
his
experience
of
such
scenes
it
was
most
sudden
madam
answered
he
i
had
the
best
grounds
for
hope
i
was
being
persuaded
we
should
save
him
and
then
quite
suddenly
without
an
instant
warning
he
succumbed
he
just
heaved
a
sigh
and
was
gone
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
senses
he
would
have
added
more
particulars
of
his
feelings
and
emotions
for
he
was
of
those
who
believe
that
their
own
impressions
of
a
phenomenon
are
that
phenomenon
most
interesting
manifestations
but
her
ladyship
waved
him
peremptorily
into
silence
he
drew
back
washing
his
hands
in
the
air
an
expression
of
polite
concern
upon
his
face
is
there
aught
else
i
can
do
to
be
of
service
to
your
ladyship
he
inquired
solicitous
what
else
she
asked
with
a
fuller
return
to
her
old
self
killed
him
what
more
is
there
you
can
do
oh
madam
nay
madam
i
am
most
deeply
grieved
that
my
my
his
lordship
will
wait
upon
you
to
the
door
said
she
designating
her
son
the
eminent
physician
effaced
himself
from
her
ladyship
attention
it
was
his
boast
that
he
could
take
a
hint
when
one
was
given
him
and
so
he
could
provided
it
were
broad
enough
as
in
the
present
instance
he
gathered
up
his
hat
and
cane
the
unfailing
insignia
of
his
order
and
was
gone
swiftly
and
silently
rotherby
closed
the
door
after
him
and
returned
slowly
head
bowed
to
the
window
where
his
mother
was
still
seated
they
looked
at
each
other
gravely
for
a
long
moment
this
makes
matters
easier
for
you
she
said
at
length
much
easier
it
does
not
matter
now
how
far
his
complicity
may
be
betrayed
by
his
papers
i
am
glad
madam
to
see
you
so
far
recovered
from
your
she
shivered
as
much
perhaps
at
his
tone
as
at
the
recollections
he
evoked
you
are
very
indifferent
charles
said
she
he
looked
at
her
steadily
then
slightly
shrugged
what
need
to
wear
a
mask
bah
did
he
ever
give
me
cause
to
feel
for
him
he
asked
mother
if
one
day
i
have
a
son
of
my
own
i
shall
see
to
it
that
he
loves
you
will
be
hard
put
to
it
with
your
nature
charles
she
told
him
critically
then
she
rose
will
you
go
to
him
with
me
she
asked
he
made
as
if
to
acquiesce
then
halted
no
he
said
and
there
was
repugnance
in
his
tone
and
face
not
not
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
rapid
insistent
grateful
for
the
interruption
rotherby
went
to
open
green
staggered
forward
with
swollen
eyes
his
face
inflamed
with
rage
and
with
something
else
that
was
not
quite
apparent
to
rotherby
my
lord
he
cried
in
a
loud
angry
voice
rotherby
caught
his
wrist
and
checked
him
sh
sir
he
said
gravely
not
and
he
pushed
him
out
again
her
ladyship
following
them
it
was
in
the
gallery
above
the
hall
in
which
the
servants
still
stood
idly
about
that
green
spattered
out
his
wrathful
tale
of
what
had
befallen
in
the
library
rotherby
shook
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
rat
you
cursed
fool
he
cried
you
left
him
there
at
the
desk
what
help
had
i
demanded
green
with
spirit
my
eyes
were
on
fire
i
could
see
and
the
pain
of
them
made
me
then
why
did
ye
not
send
word
to
me
at
once
you
fool
because
i
was
concerned
only
to
stop
my
eyes
from
burning
answered
green
in
a
towering
rage
at
finding
reproof
where
he
had
come
in
quest
of
sympathy
i
have
come
to
you
at
the
first
moment
damn
you
he
burst
out
in
full
rebellion
and
you
use
me
civilly
now
that
i
am
come
or
ecod
it
be
the
worse
for
your
rotherby
considered
him
through
a
faint
mist
that
rage
had
set
before
his
eyes
to
be
so
spoken
to
damned
indeed
by
a
dirty
spy
had
he
been
alone
with
the
man
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
jeopardized
his
very
precarious
future
by
kicking
green
downstairs
but
his
mother
saved
him
from
that
rashness
it
may
be
that
she
saw
something
of
his
anger
in
his
kindling
eye
and
thought
it
well
to
intervene
she
set
a
hand
on
his
sleeve
charles
she
said
to
him
in
a
voice
that
was
dead
cold
with
warning
he
responded
to
it
and
chose
discretion
he
looked
green
over
nevertheless
i
vow
i
very
patient
with
you
said
he
and
green
had
the
discretion
on
his
side
to
hold
his
tongue
come
man
while
we
stand
talking
here
that
knave
may
be
destroying
precious
and
his
lordship
went
quickly
down
the
stairs
green
following
hard
upon
his
heels
and
her
ladyship
bringing
up
the
rear
at
the
door
of
the
library
rotherby
came
to
a
halt
and
turned
the
handle
the
door
was
locked
he
beckoned
a
couple
of
footmen
across
the
hall
and
bade
them
break
it
open
chapter
xx
caryll
identity
i
must
see
lord
ostermore
had
been
caryll
wild
cry
as
he
strode
to
the
door
from
the
other
side
of
it
there
came
a
sound
of
steps
and
voices
some
one
was
turning
the
handle
hortensia
caught
caryll
by
the
sleeve
but
the
letters
she
cried
frantically
and
pointed
to
the
incriminating
papers
which
he
had
left
forgotten
upon
the
desk
he
stared
at
her
a
moment
and
memory
swept
upon
him
in
a
flood
he
mastered
the
wild
agitation
that
had
been
swaying
him
thrust
the
paper
that
he
was
carrying
into
his
pocket
and
turned
to
go
back
for
the
treasonable
letters
the
taper
he
exclaimed
and
pointed
to
the
extinguished
candle
on
the
floor
what
can
we
do
a
sharp
blow
fell
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
he
stood
still
looking
over
his
shoulder
quick
make
haste
hortensia
admonished
him
in
her
excitement
get
them
conceal
them
at
least
do
the
best
you
can
since
we
have
not
the
means
to
burn
a
second
blow
was
struck
succeeded
instantly
by
a
third
and
something
was
heard
to
snap
the
door
swung
open
and
green
and
rotherby
sprang
into
the
room
a
brace
of
footmen
at
their
heels
they
were
followed
more
leisurely
by
the
countess
whilst
a
little
flock
of
servants
brought
up
the
rear
but
checked
upon
the
threshold
and
hung
there
to
witness
events
that
held
out
such
promise
of
being
unusual
caryll
swore
through
set
teeth
and
made
a
dash
for
the
desk
but
he
was
too
late
to
accomplish
his
object
his
hand
had
scarcely
closed
upon
the
letters
when
he
was
himself
seized
rotherby
and
green
on
either
side
of
him
held
him
in
their
grasp
each
with
one
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
the
other
at
his
wrist
thus
stood
he
powerless
between
them
and
after
the
first
shock
of
it
cool
and
making
no
effort
to
disengage
himself
his
right
hand
was
tightly
clenched
upon
the
letters
rotherby
called
a
servant
forward
take
those
papers
from
the
hand
he
commanded
stop
cried
caryll
lord
rotherby
may
i
speak
with
you
alone
before
you
go
further
in
a
matter
you
will
bitterly
regret
take
those
papers
from
him
rotherby
repeated
swearing
and
the
servant
bent
to
the
task
but
caryll
suddenly
wrenched
the
hand
away
from
the
fellow
and
the
wrist
out
of
lord
rotherby
grip
a
moment
my
lord
as
you
value
your
honor
and
your
possessions
he
insisted
let
me
speak
with
lord
ostermore
first
take
me
before
you
are
before
him
now
said
rotherby
say
on
i
demand
to
see
lord
i
am
lord
ostermore
said
rotherby
you
since
when
said
caryll
not
even
beginning
to
understand
since
ten
minutes
ago
was
the
callous
answer
that
first
gave
that
household
the
news
of
my
lord
passing
there
was
a
movement
a
muttering
among
the
servants
old
humphries
broke
through
the
group
by
the
door
his
heavy
chops
white
and
trembling
and
in
that
moment
hortensia
turned
to
ask
her
ladyship
was
this
true
her
ladyship
nodded
in
silence
hortensia
cried
out
and
sank
to
a
chair
as
if
beaten
down
by
the
news
whilst
the
old
servant
answered
too
withdrew
wringing
his
hands
and
making
foolish
laments
and
the
tears
of
those
were
the
only
tears
that
watered
the
grave
of
john
caryll
fifth
earl
of
ostermore
as
for
caryll
the
shock
of
that
announcement
seemed
to
cast
a
spell
upon
him
he
stood
still
limp
and
almost
numbed
oh
the
irony
of
things
that
his
father
should
have
died
at
such
a
moment
dead
quoth
he
dead
is
my
lord
dead
they
told
me
he
was
they
told
you
false
answered
rotherby
so
now
those
papers
caryll
relinquished
them
take
them
he
said
since
that
is
so
take
rotherby
received
them
himself
remove
his
sword
he
bade
a
footman
caryll
looked
sharply
round
at
him
my
sword
quoth
he
what
do
you
mean
by
that
what
right
we
mean
to
keep
you
by
us
sir
said
green
on
his
other
side
until
you
have
explained
what
you
were
doing
with
those
papers
what
is
your
interest
in
meanwhile
a
servant
had
done
his
lordship
bidding
and
caryll
stood
weaponless
amid
his
enemies
he
mastered
himself
at
once
here
it
was
plain
that
he
must
walk
with
caution
for
the
ground
he
perceived
was
of
a
sudden
grown
most
insecure
and
treacherous
rotherby
and
green
in
league
it
gave
him
matter
for
much
thought
there
not
the
need
to
hold
me
said
he
quietly
i
am
not
likely
to
tire
myself
by
violence
there
scarcely
necessity
for
so
rotherby
looked
up
sharply
the
cool
tone
had
an
intimidating
note
but
green
laughed
maliciously
as
he
continued
to
mop
his
still
watering
eyes
he
was
acquainted
with
methods
and
knew
that
probably
the
more
at
ease
he
seemed
the
less
at
ease
he
was
rotherby
spread
the
letters
on
the
desk
and
scanned
them
with
a
glowing
eye
green
at
his
elbow
reading
with
him
the
countess
swept
forward
that
she
too
might
inspect
this
find
they
serve
their
turn
said
her
son
and
added
to
caryll
and
they
help
to
hang
no
doubt
you
find
me
mentioned
in
them
said
caryll
ay
sir
snapped
green
if
not
by
name
at
least
as
the
messenger
who
is
to
explain
that
which
the
writers
the
royal
writer
and
the
other
have
out
of
prudence
seen
fit
to
hortensia
looked
up
and
across
the
room
at
that
a
wild
fear
clutching
at
her
heart
but
caryll
laughed
pleasantly
eyebrows
raised
as
if
in
mild
surprise
the
most
excellent
relations
appear
to
prevail
between
you
said
he
looking
from
rotherby
to
green
are
you
too
my
lord
in
the
secretary
his
lordship
flushed
darkly
you
clown
it
to
the
end
he
sneered
and
that
none
so
far
off
snarled
green
who
since
the
peppering
of
his
eyes
had
flung
aside
his
usual
cherubic
air
oh
you
may
sneer
sir
he
mocked
the
prisoner
but
we
have
you
fast
this
letter
was
brought
hither
by
you
and
this
one
was
to
have
been
carried
hence
by
the
latter
sir
was
a
matter
for
the
future
and
you
can
hardly
prove
what
a
man
will
do
so
we
let
that
pass
as
for
the
former
the
letter
which
you
say
i
brought
you
remember
that
you
searched
me
at
maidstone
and
i
have
your
admission
that
the
letter
was
upon
you
at
the
time
roared
the
spy
interrupting
him
your
admission
in
the
presence
of
that
lady
as
she
can
be
made
to
mistress
winthrop
rose
is
a
lie
she
said
firmly
i
can
not
be
made
to
caryll
smiled
and
nodded
across
to
her
is
vastly
kind
in
you
mistress
winthrop
but
the
gentleman
is
he
turned
to
green
harkee
sirrah
did
i
admit
that
i
had
carried
that
letter
green
shrugged
you
admitted
that
you
carried
a
letter
what
other
letter
should
it
have
been
but
that
nay
smiled
caryll
is
not
for
you
to
ask
me
rather
is
it
for
you
to
prove
that
the
letter
i
admitted
having
carried
and
that
letter
are
one
and
the
same
take
a
deal
of
proving
i
dare
ye
be
forsworn
then
put
in
her
ladyship
sourly
for
i
can
witness
to
the
letter
that
you
bore
not
only
did
i
see
it
a
letter
on
that
same
fine
paper
in
my
husband
hands
on
the
day
you
came
here
and
during
your
visit
but
i
have
his
lordship
own
word
for
it
that
he
was
in
the
plot
and
that
you
were
the
ah
chuckled
green
what
now
sir
what
now
by
what
fresh
piece
of
acrobatics
will
you
get
out
of
that
ye
a
fool
said
caryll
with
calm
contempt
and
fetched
out
his
d
dream
that
one
witness
will
suffice
to
establish
so
grave
a
charge
pah
he
opened
his
to
find
it
empty
and
viciously
snapped
down
the
lid
again
pah
he
said
again
ye
cost
me
a
whole
boxfull
of
why
did
ye
throw
it
in
my
face
demanded
green
what
purpose
did
ye
look
to
serve
but
one
of
treason
answer
me
that
i
did
like
the
way
ye
looked
at
me
was
wanting
respect
and
i
bethought
me
i
would
lessen
the
impudence
of
your
expression
have
ye
any
other
foolish
questions
for
me
and
he
looked
again
from
green
to
rotherby
including
both
in
his
inquiry
no
he
rose
in
that
case
if
you
give
me
leave
and
you
do
not
leave
this
house
rotherby
informed
him
i
think
you
push
hospitality
too
far
will
you
desire
your
lackey
to
return
me
my
sword
i
have
affairs
mr
caryll
i
beg
that
you
will
understand
said
his
lordship
with
a
calm
that
he
was
at
some
pains
to
maintain
that
you
do
not
leave
this
house
save
in
the
care
of
the
messengers
from
the
secretary
of
caryll
looked
at
him
and
yawned
in
his
face
ye
prodigiously
tiresome
said
he
did
ye
but
know
how
i
detest
disturbances
what
shall
the
secretary
of
state
require
of
me
he
require
you
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
said
green
have
you
a
warrant
to
take
me
i
have
not
but
then
how
do
you
dare
detain
me
sir
demanded
caryll
sharply
d
think
i
do
know
the
law
i
think
you
know
a
deal
more
of
it
shortly
countered
green
meanwhile
sirs
i
depart
offer
me
violence
at
your
he
moved
a
step
and
then
at
a
sign
from
rotherby
the
lackey
hands
fell
on
him
again
and
forced
him
back
and
down
into
his
chair
away
with
you
for
the
warrant
said
rotherby
to
green
we
keep
him
here
till
you
green
grinned
at
the
prisoner
and
was
gone
in
great
haste
caryll
lounged
back
in
his
chair
and
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
i
have
always
endeavored
said
he
to
suffer
fools
as
gladly
as
a
christian
should
so
since
you
insist
i
be
patient
until
i
have
the
ear
of
my
lord
carteret
who
i
take
it
is
a
man
of
sense
but
if
i
were
you
my
lord
and
you
my
lady
i
should
not
insist
believe
me
you
cut
poor
figures
as
for
you
my
lord
ye
in
none
such
good
odor
as
it
let
that
be
snarled
his
lordship
if
i
mention
it
at
all
i
but
do
so
in
your
lordship
own
interests
it
will
be
remembered
that
ye
attempted
to
murder
me
once
and
that
will
not
be
of
any
great
help
to
such
accusations
as
you
may
bring
against
me
besides
which
there
is
the
unfortunate
circumstance
that
widely
known
ye
not
a
man
to
be
will
you
be
silent
roared
his
lordship
in
a
towering
passion
if
i
trouble
myself
to
speak
at
all
it
is
out
of
concern
for
your
lordship
caryll
insisted
sweetly
and
in
your
own
interest
and
your
ladyship
too
i
counsel
you
to
hear
me
a
moment
without
his
tone
was
calculatedly
grave
lord
rotherby
looked
at
him
sneering
not
so
her
ladyship
less
acquainted
with
his
ways
the
absolute
confidence
and
unconcern
of
his
demeanor
was
causing
her
uneasiness
a
man
who
was
perilously
entrammelled
would
not
bear
himself
so
easily
she
opined
she
rose
and
crossed
to
her
son
side
what
have
you
to
say
she
asked
caryll
nay
madam
he
replied
not
before
and
he
indicated
the
servants
is
but
a
pretext
to
have
them
out
of
the
room
said
rotherby
caryll
laughed
the
notion
to
scorn
if
you
think
that
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
to
attempt
no
violence
nor
to
depart
until
you
shall
give
me
leave
said
he
rotherby
judging
caryll
by
his
knowledge
of
himself
still
hesitated
but
her
ladyship
realized
in
spite
of
her
detestation
of
the
man
that
he
was
not
of
the
temper
of
those
whose
word
is
to
be
doubted
she
signed
to
the
footmen
go
she
bade
them
wait
within
they
departed
and
caryll
remained
seated
for
all
that
her
ladyship
was
standing
it
was
as
if
by
that
he
wished
to
show
how
little
he
was
minded
to
move
her
ladyship
eye
fell
upon
hortensia
do
you
go
too
child
she
bade
her
instead
hortensia
came
forward
i
wish
to
remain
madam
she
said
did
i
ask
you
what
you
wished
demanded
the
countess
my
place
is
here
hortensia
explained
unless
caryll
should
himself
desire
me
to
nay
nay
he
cried
and
smiled
upon
her
fondly
so
fondly
that
the
countess
eyes
grew
wider
with
all
my
heart
i
desire
you
to
remain
it
is
most
fitting
you
should
hear
that
which
i
have
to
what
does
it
mean
demanded
rotherby
thrusting
himself
forward
and
scowling
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
what
d
mean
hortensia
i
am
caryll
betrothed
wife
she
answered
quietly
rotherby
mouth
fell
open
but
he
made
no
sound
not
so
her
ladyship
a
peal
of
shrill
laughter
broke
from
her
la
what
did
i
tell
you
charles
then
to
hortensia
i
sorry
for
you
said
she
i
think
ye
been
a
thought
too
long
in
making
up
your
and
she
laughed
again
lord
ostermore
lies
above
stairs
hortensia
reminded
her
and
her
ladyship
went
white
at
the
reminder
the
indecency
of
her
laughter
borne
in
upon
her
would
ye
lesson
me
girl
she
cried
as
much
to
cover
her
confusion
as
to
vent
her
anger
at
the
cause
of
it
ye
an
odd
daring
by
god
ye
be
well
matched
with
his
impudence
rotherby
singularly
recalled
her
to
the
occasion
mr
caryll
is
waiting
said
he
a
sneer
in
his
voice
ah
yes
she
said
and
flashing
a
last
malignant
glance
upon
hortensia
she
sank
to
a
chair
beside
her
but
not
too
near
her
caryll
sat
back
his
legs
crossed
his
elbows
on
his
his
together
the
thing
i
have
to
tell
you
is
of
some
gravity
he
announced
by
way
of
preface
rotherby
took
a
seat
by
the
desk
his
hand
upon
the
treasonable
letters
proceed
sir
he
said
importantly
caryll
nodded
as
in
acknowledgment
of
the
invitation
i
will
admit
before
going
further
that
in
spite
of
the
cheerful
countenance
i
maintained
before
your
lordship
friend
the
bumbailiff
and
your
lackeys
i
recognize
that
you
have
me
in
a
very
dangerous
ah
from
his
lordship
in
a
breath
of
satisfaction
and
ah
from
hortensia
in
a
gasp
of
apprehension
her
ladyship
retained
a
stony
countenance
and
a
silence
that
sorted
excellently
with
it
there
is
caryll
proceeded
marking
off
the
points
on
his
fingers
the
incident
at
maidstone
there
is
your
ladyship
evidence
that
i
was
the
bearer
of
just
such
a
letter
on
the
day
that
first
i
came
here
there
is
the
dangerous
circumstance
of
which
green
i
am
sure
will
not
fail
to
make
a
deal
of
my
intimacy
with
sir
richard
everard
and
my
constant
visits
to
his
lodging
where
i
was
in
fact
on
the
occasion
when
he
met
his
death
there
is
the
fact
that
i
committed
upon
green
an
assault
with
my
snuff
box
for
motives
that
after
all
admit
of
but
one
acceptable
explanation
and
lastly
there
is
the
circumstance
that
apparently
if
interrogated
i
can
show
no
good
reason
why
i
should
be
in
england
at
all
where
no
apparent
interest
has
called
me
or
keeps
me
now
these
matters
are
so
trivial
that
taken
separately
they
have
no
value
whatever
taken
conjointly
their
value
is
not
great
they
do
not
contain
evidence
enough
to
justify
the
hanging
of
a
dog
and
yet
i
realize
that
disturbed
as
the
times
are
fearful
of
sedition
as
the
government
finds
itself
in
consequence
of
the
mischief
done
to
public
credit
by
the
south
sea
disaster
and
ready
as
the
ministry
is
to
see
plots
everywhere
and
to
make
examples
pour
discourager
les
autres
if
the
accusation
you
intend
is
laid
against
me
backed
by
such
evidence
as
this
it
is
not
impossible
indeed
it
is
not
improbable
that
it
may
ah
tend
to
shorten
my
sir
sneered
rotherby
i
declare
you
should
have
been
a
lawyer
we
have
a
pleader
of
such
parts
and
such
lucidity
at
the
whole
caryll
nodded
his
thanks
your
praise
is
very
flattering
my
lord
said
he
with
a
wry
smile
and
then
proceeded
it
is
because
i
see
my
case
to
be
so
very
nearly
desperate
that
i
venture
to
hope
you
will
not
persevere
in
the
course
you
are
proposing
to
lord
rotherby
laughed
noiselessly
can
you
urge
me
any
reasons
why
we
should
not
if
you
could
urge
me
any
reasons
why
you
should
said
caryll
no
doubt
i
should
be
able
to
show
you
under
what
misapprehensions
you
are
he
shot
a
keen
glance
at
his
lordship
whose
face
had
suddenly
gone
blank
caryll
smiled
quietly
there
is
in
this
something
that
i
do
not
understand
he
resumed
it
does
not
satisfy
me
to
suppose
as
at
first
might
seem
that
you
are
acting
out
of
sheer
malice
against
me
you
have
scarcely
cause
to
do
that
my
lord
and
you
my
lady
have
none
that
fool
green
patience
he
conceives
that
he
has
suffered
at
my
hands
but
without
your
assistance
green
would
be
powerless
to
hurt
me
what
then
is
it
that
is
moving
you
he
paused
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
declared
enemies
they
exchanged
glances
hortensia
watching
them
breathless
her
own
mind
working
too
upon
this
question
that
caryll
had
set
yet
nowhere
finding
an
answer
i
had
thought
said
her
ladyship
at
last
that
you
promised
to
tell
us
something
that
it
was
in
our
interest
to
hear
instead
you
appear
to
be
asking
caryll
shifted
in
his
chair
one
glance
he
gave
the
countess
then
smiled
i
have
sought
at
your
hands
the
reasons
why
you
should
desire
my
death
said
he
slowly
you
withhold
them
be
it
so
i
take
it
that
you
are
ashamed
of
them
and
so
their
nature
is
not
difficult
to
sir
began
rotherby
hotly
from
his
seat
nay
let
him
trundle
on
charles
said
his
mother
he
be
the
sooner
instead
proceeded
caryll
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
i
will
now
urge
you
my
reasons
why
you
should
not
so
ha
snapped
rotherby
they
will
need
to
be
caryll
twisted
farther
round
to
face
his
lordship
more
fully
they
are
as
valid
said
he
very
impressively
so
impressively
and
sternly
that
his
hearers
felt
themselves
turning
cold
under
his
words
filled
with
some
mysterious
apprehension
they
are
as
valid
as
were
my
reasons
for
holding
my
hand
in
the
field
out
yonder
when
i
had
you
at
the
mercy
of
my
sword
my
lord
neither
more
nor
less
from
that
you
may
judge
them
to
be
very
but
ye
do
name
them
said
her
ladyship
attempting
to
conquer
her
uneasiness
i
shall
do
so
said
he
and
turned
again
to
his
lordship
i
had
no
cause
to
love
you
that
morning
nor
at
any
time
my
lord
i
had
no
cause
to
think
as
even
you
in
your
heart
must
realize
if
so
be
that
you
have
a
heart
and
the
intelligence
to
examine
it
i
had
no
cause
to
think
my
lord
that
i
should
be
doing
other
than
a
good
deed
by
letting
drive
my
blade
that
such
an
opinion
was
well
founded
was
proven
by
the
thing
you
did
when
i
turned
my
back
upon
you
after
sparing
your
useless
rotherby
broke
in
tempestuously
smiting
the
desk
before
him
if
you
think
to
move
us
to
mercy
by
such
oh
not
to
mercy
would
i
move
you
said
caryll
his
hand
raised
to
stay
the
other
not
to
mercy
but
to
horror
of
the
thing
you
and
then
in
an
oddly
impressive
manner
he
launched
his
thunderbolt
know
then
that
if
that
morning
i
would
not
spill
your
blood
it
was
because
i
should
have
been
spilling
the
same
blood
that
flows
in
my
own
veins
it
was
because
you
are
my
brother
because
your
father
was
my
father
no
less
than
that
was
the
reason
that
withheld
my
he
had
announced
his
aim
of
moving
them
to
horror
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
missed
it
for
in
frozen
horror
sat
they
all
their
eyes
upon
him
their
cheeks
ashen
their
mouths
agape
even
hortensia
who
from
what
already
caryll
had
told
her
understood
now
more
than
any
of
them
after
a
spell
rotherby
spoke
you
are
my
brother
he
said
his
voice
colorless
my
brother
what
are
you
saying
and
then
her
ladyship
found
her
voice
who
was
your
mother
she
inquired
and
her
very
tone
was
an
insult
not
to
the
man
who
sat
there
so
much
as
to
the
memory
of
poor
antoinette
de
maligny
he
flushed
to
the
temples
then
paled
again
i
not
name
her
to
your
ladyship
said
he
at
last
in
a
cold
imperious
voice
i
glad
ye
so
much
decency
she
countered
you
mistake
i
think
said
he
is
respect
for
my
mother
that
inspires
and
his
green
eyes
flashed
upon
the
painted
hag
she
rose
up
a
very
fury
what
are
you
saying
she
shrilled
d
hear
the
filthy
fellow
rotherby
he
not
name
the
wanton
in
my
presence
out
of
respect
for
for
shame
madam
you
are
speaking
of
his
mother
cried
hortensia
hot
with
indignation
pshaw
is
all
an
impudent
lie
a
pack
of
lies
cried
rotherby
crafty
as
all
the
imps
of
caryll
rose
here
in
the
sight
of
god
and
by
all
that
i
hold
most
sacred
i
swear
that
what
i
have
said
is
true
i
swear
that
lord
ostermore
your
father
was
my
father
i
was
born
in
france
in
the
year
as
i
have
papers
upon
me
that
will
prove
which
you
may
see
his
lordship
rose
produce
them
said
he
shortly
caryll
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
the
small
leather
case
that
sir
richard
everard
had
given
him
from
this
he
took
a
paper
which
he
unfolded
it
was
a
certificate
of
baptism
copied
from
the
register
of
the
church
of
antoine
in
paris
rotherby
held
out
his
hand
for
it
but
caryll
shook
his
head
stand
here
beside
me
and
read
it
said
he
obeying
him
rotherby
went
and
read
that
authenticated
copy
wherein
it
was
declared
that
sir
richard
everard
had
brought
to
the
church
of
antoine
for
baptism
a
male
child
which
he
had
declared
to
be
the
son
of
john
caryll
viscount
rotherby
and
antoinette
de
maligny
and
which
had
received
in
baptism
the
name
of
justin
rotherby
drew
away
again
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
her
ladyship
was
seated
her
eyes
upon
her
son
her
fingers
drumming
absently
at
the
arms
of
her
chair
then
rotherby
swung
round
again
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
the
person
designated
there
this
justin
caryll
you
do
not
but
you
may
cast
your
mind
back
to
that
night
at
when
you
picked
your
quarrel
with
me
my
lord
do
you
remember
how
stapleton
and
collis
spoke
up
for
me
declared
that
they
had
known
me
from
boyhood
at
oxford
and
had
visited
me
at
my
chateau
in
france
what
was
the
name
of
that
chateau
my
lord
do
you
remember
rotherby
looked
at
him
searching
his
memory
but
he
did
not
need
to
search
far
at
first
glance
the
name
of
maligny
had
seemed
familiar
to
him
it
was
maligny
he
replied
and
yet
if
more
is
needed
to
convince
you
i
can
bring
a
hundred
witnesses
from
france
who
have
known
me
from
infancy
you
may
take
it
that
i
can
establish
my
identity
beyond
all
and
what
if
you
do
demanded
her
ladyship
suddenly
what
if
you
do
establish
your
identity
as
my
lord
bastard
what
claim
shall
that
be
upon
us
that
answered
caryll
very
gravely
i
wait
to
learn
from
my
brother
chapter
xxi
the
lion
skin
for
a
spell
there
was
utter
silence
in
that
spacious
pillared
chamber
caryll
and
her
ladyship
had
both
resumed
their
chairs
the
former
spuriously
calm
the
latter
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
agitation
hortensia
leant
forward
an
eager
spectator
watching
the
three
actors
in
this
tragicomedy
as
for
rotherby
he
stood
with
bent
head
and
furrowed
brow
it
was
for
him
to
speak
and
yet
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
for
words
he
was
not
moved
at
the
news
he
had
received
so
much
as
dismayed
it
dictated
a
course
that
would
interfere
with
all
his
plans
and
therefore
a
course
unthinkable
so
he
remained
puzzled
how
to
act
how
to
deal
with
this
unexpected
situation
it
was
her
ladyship
who
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
she
had
been
considering
caryll
through
narrowing
eyes
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drawn
down
she
had
caught
the
name
of
maligny
when
it
was
uttered
and
out
of
the
knowledge
which
happened
to
be
hers
though
caryll
was
ignorant
of
this
it
set
her
thinking
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
the
son
of
mademoiselle
de
maligny
she
said
at
last
i
never
heard
that
my
lord
had
a
son
i
can
not
believe
there
was
so
much
between
caryll
stared
startled
out
of
his
habitual
calm
rotherby
turned
to
her
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
how
he
cried
you
knew
then
my
father
was
she
laughed
mirthlessly
your
father
would
have
married
her
had
he
dared
she
informed
them
was
to
beg
his
father
consent
that
he
braved
his
banishment
and
came
to
england
but
his
father
was
as
headstrong
as
himself
held
just
such
views
as
he
himself
held
later
where
you
were
concerned
he
would
not
hear
of
the
match
i
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
my
father
was
a
man
who
traded
in
his
children
and
he
had
offered
me
with
a
jointure
that
was
a
fortune
to
the
earl
of
ostermore
as
a
wife
for
his
caryll
was
listening
all
ears
some
light
was
being
shed
upon
much
that
had
lain
in
darkness
and
so
she
proceeded
your
grandfather
constrained
your
father
to
forget
the
woman
he
had
left
in
france
and
to
marry
me
i
know
not
what
sins
i
had
committed
that
i
should
have
been
visited
with
such
a
punishment
but
so
it
befell
your
father
resisted
dallying
with
the
matter
for
a
whole
year
then
there
was
a
duel
fought
a
cousin
of
mademoiselle
de
maligny
crossed
to
england
and
forced
a
quarrel
upon
your
father
they
met
and
de
maligny
was
killed
then
a
change
set
in
in
my
lord
bearing
and
one
day
a
month
or
so
later
he
gave
way
to
his
father
insistence
and
we
were
wed
but
i
do
not
believe
that
my
lord
had
left
a
son
in
france
i
do
not
believe
that
had
he
done
so
i
should
not
have
known
it
i
do
not
believe
that
under
such
circumstances
unfeeling
as
he
was
he
would
have
abandoned
mademoiselle
de
you
think
then
said
rotherby
that
this
man
has
raked
up
this
story
to
consider
what
you
are
saying
cut
in
caryll
with
a
flash
of
scorn
should
i
have
come
prepared
with
documents
against
such
a
happening
as
this
nay
but
the
documents
might
have
been
intended
for
some
other
purpose
had
my
lord
lived
some
purpose
of
extortion
suggested
her
ladyship
but
consider
again
madam
that
i
am
wealthy
far
wealthier
than
was
ever
my
lord
ostermore
as
my
friends
collis
stapleton
and
many
another
can
be
called
to
prove
what
need
then
had
i
to
extort
how
came
you
by
your
means
being
what
you
say
you
are
she
asked
him
briefly
he
told
her
how
sir
richard
everard
had
cared
for
him
for
his
mother
sake
endowed
him
richly
upon
adopting
him
and
since
made
him
heir
to
all
his
wealth
which
was
considerable
and
for
the
rest
madam
and
you
rotherby
set
doubts
on
one
side
your
ladyship
says
that
had
my
lord
had
a
son
you
must
have
heard
of
it
but
my
lord
madam
never
knew
he
had
a
son
tell
me
can
you
recall
the
date
the
month
at
least
in
which
my
lord
returned
to
england
i
can
sir
it
was
at
the
end
of
april
of
what
then
caryll
produced
the
certificate
again
he
beckoned
rotherby
and
held
the
paper
under
his
eyes
what
date
is
there
the
date
of
birth
rotherby
read
the
third
of
january
of
caryll
folded
the
paper
again
that
will
help
your
ladyship
to
understand
how
it
might
happen
that
my
lord
remained
in
ignorance
of
my
he
sighed
as
he
replaced
the
case
in
his
pocket
i
would
he
had
known
before
he
died
said
he
almost
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
now
her
ladyship
lost
her
temper
she
saw
rotherby
wavering
and
it
angered
her
and
angered
she
committed
a
grave
error
wisdom
lay
in
maintaining
the
attitude
of
repudiation
it
would
at
least
have
afforded
some
excuse
for
her
and
rotherby
instead
she
now
recklessly
flung
off
that
armor
and
went
naked
down
into
the
fray
a
fig
all
she
cried
and
snapped
her
fingers
she
had
risen
and
she
towered
there
a
lean
and
malevolent
figure
her
nodding
foolishly
what
does
it
matter
that
you
be
what
you
claim
to
be
is
it
to
weigh
with
you
rotherby
rotherby
turned
grave
eyes
upon
her
he
was
it
seemed
not
quite
rotten
through
and
through
there
was
still
in
him
in
the
depths
of
him
a
core
that
was
in
a
measure
sound
and
that
core
was
reached
most
of
all
had
the
story
weighed
with
him
because
it
afforded
the
only
explanation
of
why
caryll
had
spared
his
life
that
morning
of
the
duel
it
was
a
matter
that
had
puzzled
him
as
it
had
puzzled
all
who
had
witnessed
the
affront
that
led
to
the
encounter
between
that
and
the
rest
to
say
nothing
of
the
certificate
he
had
seen
which
he
could
not
suppose
a
forgery
he
was
convinced
that
caryll
was
the
brother
that
he
claimed
to
be
he
gathered
from
his
mother
sudden
anger
that
she
too
was
convinced
in
spite
of
herself
by
the
answers
caryll
had
returned
to
all
her
arguments
against
the
identity
he
claimed
he
hated
caryll
no
whit
less
for
what
he
had
learnt
if
anything
he
hated
him
more
and
yet
a
sense
of
decency
forbade
him
from
persecuting
him
now
as
he
had
intended
and
delivering
to
the
hangman
from
ordinary
murder
once
in
the
heat
of
passion
as
we
have
seen
he
had
not
shrunk
but
fratricide
appeared
such
is
the
effect
of
education
a
far
far
graver
thing
even
though
it
should
be
indirect
fratricide
of
the
sort
that
he
had
contemplated
before
learning
that
this
man
was
his
brother
there
seemed
to
be
one
of
two
only
courses
left
him
to
provide
caryll
with
the
means
of
escape
or
else
to
withhold
such
evidence
as
he
intended
to
supply
against
him
and
to
persuade
to
compel
if
necessary
his
mother
to
do
the
same
when
all
was
said
his
interests
need
not
suffer
very
greatly
his
position
would
not
be
quite
so
strong
perhaps
if
he
but
betrayed
a
plot
without
delivering
up
any
of
the
plotters
still
he
thought
it
should
be
strong
enough
his
father
dead
out
of
consideration
of
the
signal
loyalty
his
act
must
manifest
he
thought
the
government
would
prove
grateful
and
forbear
from
prosecuting
a
claim
for
restitution
against
the
ostermore
estates
he
had
then
all
but
resolved
upon
the
cleaner
course
when
suddenly
something
that
in
the
stress
of
the
moment
he
had
gone
near
to
overlooking
was
urged
upon
his
attention
hortensia
had
risen
and
had
started
forward
at
her
ladyship
last
words
she
stood
before
his
lordship
now
with
pleading
eyes
and
hands
held
out
my
lord
she
cried
you
can
not
do
this
thing
you
can
not
do
it
but
instead
of
moving
him
to
generosity
by
those
very
words
she
steeled
his
heart
against
it
and
proved
to
him
that
after
all
his
potentialities
for
evil
were
strong
enough
to
enable
him
to
do
the
very
thing
she
said
he
could
not
his
brow
grew
black
as
midnight
his
dark
eyes
raked
her
face
and
saw
the
agony
of
apprehension
for
her
lover
written
there
he
drew
breath
hissing
and
audible
glanced
once
at
caryll
then
a
moment
said
he
he
strode
to
the
door
and
called
the
footmen
then
turned
again
mr
caryll
he
said
in
a
formal
voice
will
you
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
waiting
in
the
i
need
to
consider
upon
this
caryll
conceiving
that
it
was
with
his
mother
that
rotherby
intended
to
consider
rose
instantly
i
would
remind
you
rotherby
that
time
is
pressing
said
he
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
was
rotherby
cold
reply
and
caryll
went
out
what
now
charles
asked
his
mother
is
this
child
to
remain
it
is
the
child
that
is
to
remain
said
his
lordship
will
your
ladyship
do
me
the
honor
too
of
waiting
in
the
and
he
held
the
door
for
her
what
folly
are
you
considering
she
asked
your
ladyship
is
wasting
time
and
time
as
caryll
has
said
is
she
crossed
to
the
door
controlled
almost
despite
herself
by
the
calm
air
of
purpose
that
was
investing
him
you
are
not
thinking
of
you
shall
learn
very
soon
of
what
i
am
thinking
i
beg
that
you
will
give
us
she
paused
almost
upon
the
threshold
if
you
do
a
rashness
here
remember
that
i
can
still
act
without
you
she
reminded
him
you
may
choose
to
believe
that
that
man
is
your
brother
and
so
out
of
that
and
she
added
with
a
cruel
sneer
at
hortensia
other
considerations
you
may
elect
to
let
him
go
but
remember
that
you
still
have
me
to
reckon
with
whether
he
prove
of
your
blood
or
not
he
can
not
prove
himself
of
mine
thank
god
his
lordship
bowed
in
silence
preserving
an
unmoved
countenance
whereupon
she
cursed
him
for
a
fool
and
passed
out
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
hortensia
watching
him
in
a
sort
of
horror
let
me
go
she
found
voice
to
cry
at
last
and
advanced
towards
the
door
herself
but
rotherby
came
to
meet
her
his
face
white
his
eyes
glowing
she
fell
away
before
his
opening
arms
and
he
stood
still
mastering
himself
that
man
he
said
jerking
a
backward
thumb
at
the
closed
door
lives
or
dies
goes
free
or
hangs
as
you
shall
decide
she
looked
at
him
her
face
haggard
her
heart
beating
high
in
her
throat
as
if
to
suffocate
her
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
you
love
him
he
growled
pah
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
in
your
tremors
that
you
do
it
is
for
him
that
you
are
afraid
not
why
do
you
mock
me
with
it
she
inquired
with
dignity
i
do
not
mock
you
hortensia
answer
me
is
it
true
that
you
love
him
it
is
true
she
answered
steadily
what
to
you
everything
he
answered
hotly
everything
it
is
heaven
and
hell
to
me
ten
days
ago
hortensia
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
no
more
she
begged
him
an
arm
thrown
out
to
stay
him
but
there
is
more
he
answered
advancing
again
this
time
i
can
make
the
offer
more
attractive
marry
me
and
caryll
is
not
only
free
to
depart
but
no
evidence
shall
be
laid
against
him
i
swear
it
refuse
me
and
he
hangs
as
surely
as
surely
as
you
and
i
talk
together
here
this
cold
eyes
scathed
him
with
contempt
god
she
cried
what
manner
of
monster
are
you
my
lord
to
speak
so
to
speak
of
marriage
to
me
and
to
speak
of
hanging
a
man
who
is
son
to
that
same
father
of
yours
who
lies
above
stairs
not
yet
turned
cold
are
you
human
at
all
ay
and
in
nothing
so
human
as
in
my
love
for
you
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
give
me
patience
she
prayed
the
insult
of
it
after
what
has
passed
let
me
go
sir
open
that
door
and
let
me
he
stood
regarding
her
a
moment
with
lowering
brows
then
he
turned
and
went
slowly
to
the
door
he
dies
remember
said
he
and
the
words
the
sinister
tone
and
the
sinister
look
that
was
stamped
upon
his
face
shattered
her
spirit
as
at
a
blow
no
no
she
faltered
and
advanced
a
step
or
two
oh
have
pity
when
you
show
me
pity
he
answered
she
was
beaten
you
you
swear
to
let
him
go
to
see
him
safely
out
of
england
if
if
i
consent
his
eyes
blazed
he
came
back
swiftly
and
she
stood
a
frozen
thing
passively
awaiting
him
a
frozen
thing
she
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
yielding
herself
in
horrific
surrender
he
held
her
close
a
moment
the
blood
surging
to
his
face
and
glowing
darkly
through
the
swarthy
skin
have
i
conquered
then
he
cried
you
marry
me
hortensia
at
that
price
she
answered
piteously
at
that
shalt
find
me
a
gentle
loving
husband
ever
i
swear
it
before
heaven
he
vowed
the
ardor
of
his
passion
softening
his
nature
as
steel
is
softened
in
the
fire
then
be
it
so
she
said
and
her
tone
was
less
cold
for
she
began
to
glow
as
it
were
with
the
ardor
of
the
sacrifice
that
she
was
making
began
to
experience
the
exalted
ecstasy
of
martyrdom
save
him
and
you
shall
find
me
ever
a
dutiful
wife
to
you
my
lord
a
dutiful
and
loving
he
demanded
greedily
even
that
i
promise
it
she
answered
with
a
hoarse
cry
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
then
with
an
oath
he
checked
and
flung
her
from
him
so
violently
that
she
hurtled
to
a
chair
and
sank
to
it
overbalanced
no
he
roared
like
a
mad
thing
now
hell
and
damnation
no
a
wild
frenzy
of
jealousy
had
swept
aside
his
tenderness
he
was
sick
and
faint
with
the
passion
of
it
of
this
proof
of
how
deeply
she
must
love
that
other
man
he
strove
to
control
his
violence
he
snarled
at
her
in
his
endeavors
to
subdue
the
animal
the
primitive
creature
that
he
was
at
heart
if
you
can
love
him
so
much
as
that
he
had
better
hang
i
he
laughed
on
a
high
fierce
note
you
have
spoke
his
sentence
girl
d
think
i
take
you
so
at
second
hand
oh
what
d
deem
me
he
laughed
again
in
his
throat
now
a
quivering
laugh
of
anger
and
crossed
to
the
door
her
eyes
following
him
terrified
her
mind
understanding
nothing
of
this
savage
he
turned
the
key
and
flung
wide
the
door
with
a
violent
gesture
bring
him
in
he
shouted
they
entered
caryll
with
the
footmen
at
his
heels
a
frown
between
his
brows
his
eyes
glancing
quickly
and
searchingly
from
rotherby
to
hortensia
after
him
came
her
ladyship
no
less
inquisitive
of
look
rotherby
dismissed
the
lackeys
and
closed
the
door
again
he
flung
out
an
arm
to
indicate
hortensia
this
little
fool
he
said
to
caryll
would
have
married
me
to
save
your
caryll
raised
his
brows
the
words
relieved
his
fears
i
am
glad
sir
that
you
perceive
she
would
have
been
a
fool
to
do
so
you
i
take
it
have
been
fool
enough
to
refuse
the
yes
you
damned
yes
he
thundered
d
think
i
want
another
man
that
is
an
overstatement
said
caryll
mistress
winthrop
is
no
of
enough
said
snapped
rotherby
he
had
intended
to
say
much
to
do
some
mighty
ranting
but
before
caryll
cold
reduction
of
facts
to
their
true
values
he
felt
himself
robbed
of
words
you
hang
he
ended
shortly
ye
sure
of
that
questioned
caryll
i
would
i
were
as
sure
of
i
think
you
may
be
just
about
as
sure
caryll
rejoined
entirely
unperturbed
and
he
sauntered
forward
towards
hortensia
rotherby
and
his
mother
watched
him
exchanging
glances
then
rotherby
shrugged
and
sneered
is
his
bluster
said
he
be
a
farceur
to
the
end
i
doubt
he
caryll
never
heeded
him
he
was
bending
beside
hortensia
he
took
her
hand
and
bore
it
to
his
lips
sweet
he
murmured
was
a
treason
that
you
intended
have
you
then
no
faith
in
me
courage
sweetheart
they
can
not
hurt
she
clutched
his
hands
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
you
but
say
that
to
comfort
me
she
cried
not
so
he
answered
gravely
i
tell
you
no
more
than
what
is
true
they
think
they
hold
me
they
will
cheat
and
lie
and
swear
falsely
to
the
end
that
they
may
destroy
me
but
they
shall
have
their
pains
for
ay
depend
upon
that
rotherby
mocked
him
depend
upon
it
to
the
mr
caryll
curious
eyes
smiled
upon
his
brother
but
his
lips
were
contemptuous
i
am
of
your
own
blood
rotherby
your
brother
he
said
again
and
once
already
out
of
that
consideration
i
have
spared
your
life
because
i
would
not
have
a
brother
blood
upon
my
he
sighed
and
continued
i
had
hoped
that
you
had
enough
humanity
to
do
the
same
i
deplore
that
you
should
lack
it
but
i
deplore
it
for
your
own
sake
because
after
all
you
are
my
brother
apart
from
that
it
matters
nothing
to
will
it
matter
nothing
when
you
are
proved
a
jacobite
spy
cried
her
ladyship
enraged
beyond
endurance
by
this
calm
scorn
of
them
will
it
matter
nothing
when
it
is
proved
that
you
carried
that
letter
and
would
have
carried
that
other
that
you
were
empowered
to
treat
in
your
exiled
master
name
will
that
matter
nothing
he
looked
at
her
an
instant
then
as
if
utterly
disdaining
to
answer
her
he
turned
again
to
rotherby
i
were
a
fool
and
blind
did
i
not
see
to
the
bottom
of
this
turbid
little
puddle
upon
which
you
think
to
float
your
argosies
you
are
selling
me
you
are
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
government
to
forbear
the
confiscations
your
father
has
incurred
out
of
consideration
of
the
service
you
can
render
by
disclosing
this
plot
and
you
would
throw
me
in
as
something
tangible
in
earnest
of
the
others
that
may
follow
have
i
sounded
the
depths
of
your
intent
and
if
you
have
what
then
demanded
sullen
rotherby
this
my
lord
answered
caryll
and
he
quoted
man
that
once
did
sell
the
lion
skin
while
the
beast
lived
was
killed
with
hunting
him
remember
that
they
looked
at
him
impressed
by
the
ringing
voice
in
which
he
had
voice
in
which
the
ring
was
of
mingled
mockery
and
exultation
then
her
ladyship
shook
off
the
impression
and
laughed
with
what
d
threaten
us
she
asked
contemptuously
i
threaten
nay
i
am
incapable
of
threatening
i
do
not
threaten
i
have
reasoned
with
you
exhorted
you
shown
you
cause
why
had
you
one
spark
of
decency
left
you
would
allow
me
to
depart
and
shield
me
from
the
law
you
have
invoked
to
ruin
me
i
have
hoped
for
your
own
sakes
that
you
would
be
moved
so
to
do
but
since
you
will
not
he
paused
and
shrugged
on
your
own
heads
be
on
our
own
heads
be
what
demanded
rotherby
but
caryll
smiled
and
shook
his
head
did
you
know
all
it
might
indeed
influence
your
decision
and
i
would
not
have
that
happen
you
have
chosen
have
you
not
rotherby
you
will
sell
me
you
will
hang
me
me
your
father
son
poor
rotherby
from
my
soul
i
pity
you
pity
me
death
you
impudent
rogue
keep
your
pity
for
those
that
need
that
is
why
i
offer
it
you
rotherby
said
caryll
almost
sadly
in
all
my
life
i
have
not
met
a
man
who
stood
more
sorely
in
need
of
it
nor
am
i
ever
like
to
meet
there
was
a
movement
without
a
tap
at
the
door
and
humphries
entered
to
announce
green
return
accompanied
by
second
secretary
templeton
and
without
waiting
for
more
he
ushered
them
into
the
room
chapter
xxii
the
hunters
to
the
amazement
of
them
all
there
entered
a
tall
gentleman
in
a
wig
with
a
long
pale
face
a
resolute
mouth
and
a
pair
of
eyes
that
were
keen
yet
kindly
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
second
secretary
came
green
humphries
withdrew
and
closed
the
door
templeton
made
her
ladyship
a
low
bow
madam
said
he
very
gravely
i
offer
your
ladyship
and
you
my
lord
my
profoundest
condolence
in
the
bereavement
you
have
suffered
and
my
scarcely
less
profound
excuses
for
this
intrusion
upon
your
templeton
may
or
may
not
have
reflected
that
the
grief
upon
which
he
deplored
his
intrusion
was
none
so
apparent
i
had
not
ventured
to
do
so
he
continued
but
that
your
lordship
seemed
to
invite
my
invited
it
sir
questioned
rotherby
with
deference
i
should
scarcely
have
presumed
so
far
as
to
invite
not
directly
perhaps
returned
the
second
secretary
his
was
a
deep
rich
voice
and
he
spoke
with
great
deliberateness
as
if
considering
well
each
word
before
allowing
it
utterance
not
directly
perhaps
but
in
view
of
your
message
to
lord
carteret
his
lordship
has
desired
me
to
come
in
person
to
inquire
into
this
matter
for
him
before
proceeding
farther
this
fellow
indicating
green
brought
information
from
you
that
a
jacobite
an
agent
of
james
stuart
is
being
detained
here
and
that
your
lordship
has
a
communication
to
make
to
the
secretary
of
rotherby
bowed
his
assent
all
i
desired
that
green
should
do
meanwhile
said
he
was
to
procure
a
warrant
for
this
man
arrest
my
revelations
would
have
followed
that
has
he
the
warrant
your
lordship
may
not
be
aware
said
templeton
with
an
increased
precision
of
diction
that
of
late
so
many
plots
have
been
disclosed
and
have
proved
in
the
end
to
be
no
plots
at
all
that
his
lordship
has
resolved
to
proceed
now
with
the
extremest
caution
for
it
is
not
held
desirable
by
his
majesty
that
publicity
should
be
given
to
such
matters
until
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
susceptible
to
proof
talk
of
them
is
disturbing
to
the
public
quiet
and
there
is
already
disturbance
enough
as
it
unfortunately
happens
therefore
it
is
deemed
expedient
that
we
should
make
quite
sure
of
our
ground
before
proceeding
to
but
this
plot
is
no
sham
plot
cried
rotherby
with
the
faintest
show
of
heat
out
of
patience
with
the
other
deliberateness
it
is
a
very
real
danger
as
i
can
prove
to
his
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
that
fact
resumed
the
second
secretary
entirely
unruffled
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
it
before
taking
any
steps
that
would
seem
to
acknowledge
it
that
my
lord
carteret
has
desired
me
to
wait
upon
you
that
you
may
place
me
in
possession
of
the
circumstances
that
have
come
to
your
rotherby
countenance
betrayed
his
growing
impatience
why
for
that
matter
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
a
plot
is
being
hatched
by
the
friends
of
the
stuart
and
that
a
rising
is
being
prepared
the
present
moment
being
considered
auspicious
while
the
people
confidence
in
the
government
is
shaken
by
the
late
south
sea
company
templeton
wagged
his
head
gently
that
sir
if
you
will
permit
the
observation
is
the
preface
of
all
the
disclosures
that
have
lately
been
made
to
us
the
consolation
sir
for
his
majesty
friends
has
been
that
in
no
case
did
the
subsequent
matter
make
that
preface
it
is
in
that
particular
then
that
my
disclosures
shall
differ
from
those
others
said
rotherby
in
a
tone
that
caused
templeton
afterwards
to
describe
him
as
a
damned
hot
you
have
evidence
documentary
evidence
a
letter
from
the
pretender
himself
amongst
a
becoming
gravity
overspread
templeton
face
that
would
be
indeed
regrettable
said
he
it
was
plain
that
whatever
the
second
secretary
might
display
when
the
plot
was
disclosed
to
him
he
would
display
none
of
that
satisfaction
upon
which
rotherby
had
counted
to
whom
sir
let
me
ask
is
this
letter
indited
to
my
late
father
answered
his
lordship
templeton
made
an
exclamation
whose
significance
was
not
quite
clear
i
have
discovered
it
since
his
death
continued
rotherby
i
was
but
in
time
to
wrest
it
from
the
hands
of
that
spy
of
the
pretender
who
was
in
the
act
of
destroying
it
when
i
caught
him
my
devotion
to
his
majesty
made
my
course
clear
sir
and
i
desired
green
to
procure
a
warrant
for
this
traitor
sir
said
templeton
regarding
him
with
an
eye
in
which
astonishment
was
blent
with
admiration
this
is
very
loyal
in
you
very
loyal
under
the
ah
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
affair
i
do
not
think
that
his
majesty
government
considering
to
whom
this
letter
was
addressed
could
have
censured
you
even
had
you
suppressed
it
you
have
conducted
yourself
my
lord
if
i
may
venture
upon
a
criticism
of
your
lordship
conduct
with
a
patriotism
worthy
of
the
best
models
of
ancient
rome
and
i
am
assured
that
his
majesty
government
will
not
be
remiss
in
signifying
appreciation
of
this
very
lofty
loyalty
of
lord
rotherby
bowed
low
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
her
ladyship
concealed
a
cynical
smile
under
cover
of
her
fan
caryll
standing
in
the
background
beside
hortensia
chair
smiled
too
and
poor
hortensia
detecting
his
smile
sought
to
take
comfort
in
it
my
son
interposed
the
countess
is
i
am
sure
gratified
to
hear
you
so
commend
his
templeton
bowed
to
her
with
a
great
politeness
i
should
be
a
stone
did
i
not
signify
my
ah
appreciation
of
there
is
a
little
more
to
follow
sir
put
in
caryll
in
that
quiet
manner
of
his
i
think
you
will
find
it
blunt
the
edge
of
his
lordship
lofty
loyalty
cause
it
to
savor
less
like
the
patriotism
of
rome
and
more
like
that
of
templeton
turned
upon
him
a
face
of
cold
displeasure
he
would
have
spoken
but
that
whilst
he
was
seeking
words
of
a
becoming
gravity
rotherby
forestalled
him
sir
he
exclaimed
what
i
did
i
did
though
my
ruin
must
have
followed
i
know
what
this
traitor
has
in
mind
he
imagines
i
have
a
bargain
to
make
but
you
must
see
sir
that
in
no
sense
is
it
so
for
having
already
surrendered
the
facts
it
is
too
late
now
to
attempt
to
sell
them
i
am
ready
to
yield
up
the
letters
that
i
have
found
no
consideration
could
induce
me
to
do
other
and
yet
sir
i
venture
to
hope
that
in
return
the
government
will
be
pleased
to
see
that
i
have
some
claim
upon
my
country
recognition
for
the
signal
service
i
am
rendering
her
and
in
rendering
which
i
make
a
holocaust
of
my
surely
surely
sir
murmured
templeton
but
his
countenance
told
of
a
lessening
enthusiasm
in
his
lordship
roman
patriotism
lord
carteret
i
am
sure
would
never
permit
so
much
ah
devotion
to
his
majesty
to
go
i
only
ask
sir
and
i
ask
it
for
the
sake
of
my
father
name
which
stands
in
unavoidable
danger
of
being
smirched
that
no
further
shame
be
heaped
upon
it
than
that
which
must
result
from
the
horror
with
which
the
discovery
of
this
plot
will
inspire
all
caryll
smiled
and
nodded
he
judged
in
a
detached
spirit
a
mere
spectator
at
a
play
and
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
it
was
subtly
done
of
his
brother
and
showed
an
astuteness
in
this
thing
at
least
of
which
he
had
never
supposed
him
capable
there
is
sir
rotherby
proceeded
the
matter
of
my
father
dealings
with
the
south
sea
company
he
is
no
longer
alive
to
defend
himself
from
the
accusations
from
the
impeachment
which
has
been
levelled
against
him
by
our
enemy
the
duke
of
wharton
therefore
it
might
be
possible
to
make
it
appear
as
if
his
dealings
were
ah
not
ah
quite
such
as
should
befit
an
upright
gentleman
there
is
that
and
there
is
this
greater
matter
against
him
between
the
two
i
should
never
again
be
able
to
look
my
in
the
face
yet
this
is
the
more
important
since
the
safety
of
the
kingdom
is
involved
whilst
the
other
is
but
a
personal
affair
and
trivial
by
comparison
i
will
beg
sir
that
out
of
consideration
for
my
disclosing
this
dastardly
conspiracy
which
i
can
not
do
without
disclosing
my
father
misguided
share
in
it
i
will
implore
sir
that
out
of
that
consideration
lord
carteret
will
see
fit
to
dispose
that
the
south
sea
company
affair
is
allowed
to
be
forgotten
it
has
already
been
paid
for
by
my
father
with
his
templeton
looked
at
the
young
man
before
him
with
eyes
of
real
commiseration
he
was
entirely
duped
and
in
his
heart
he
regretted
that
for
a
moment
he
could
have
doubted
rotherby
integrity
of
purpose
sir
he
said
i
offer
you
my
sympathy
my
profoundest
sympathy
and
you
my
lady
as
for
this
south
sea
company
affair
well
i
am
empowered
by
lord
carteret
to
treat
only
of
the
other
matter
and
to
issue
or
not
a
warrant
for
the
apprehension
of
the
person
you
are
detaining
after
i
have
investigated
the
grounds
upon
which
his
arrest
is
urged
nevertheless
sir
i
think
i
can
say
indeed
i
think
i
can
promise
that
in
consideration
of
your
readiness
to
deliver
up
these
letters
and
provided
their
nature
is
as
serious
as
you
represent
and
also
in
consideration
of
this
your
most
signal
proof
of
loyalty
lord
carteret
will
not
wish
to
increase
the
load
which
already
you
have
to
oh
sir
cried
rotherby
in
the
deepest
emotion
i
have
no
words
in
which
to
express
my
nor
i
put
in
caryll
words
in
which
to
express
my
admiration
a
most
excellent
performance
rotherby
i
had
not
credited
you
with
so
much
templeton
frowned
upon
him
again
ye
betray
a
singular
callousness
sir
said
he
nay
sir
not
callousness
merely
the
ease
that
springs
from
a
tranquil
her
ladyship
glanced
across
at
him
and
sneered
audibly
you
hear
the
poisonous
traitor
sir
he
glories
in
a
tranquil
conscience
in
spite
of
this
murderous
matter
to
which
he
stood
rotherby
turned
aside
to
take
the
letters
from
the
desk
he
thrust
them
into
templeton
hands
here
sir
is
a
letter
from
king
james
to
my
father
and
here
is
a
letter
from
my
father
to
king
james
from
their
contents
you
will
gather
how
far
advanced
are
matters
what
devilries
are
being
hatched
here
in
his
majesty
templeton
received
them
and
crossed
to
the
window
that
he
might
examine
them
his
countenance
lengthened
rotherby
took
his
stand
beside
his
mother
chair
both
observing
caryll
who
in
his
turn
was
observing
templeton
a
faint
smile
playing
round
the
corners
of
his
mouth
once
they
saw
him
stoop
and
whisper
something
in
hortensia
ear
and
they
caught
the
upward
glance
of
her
eyes
half
fear
half
question
green
by
the
door
stood
turning
his
hat
in
his
hands
furtively
watching
everybody
whilst
drawing
no
attention
to
himself
a
matter
in
which
much
practice
had
made
him
perfect
at
last
templeton
turned
folding
the
letters
this
is
very
grave
my
lord
said
he
and
my
lord
carteret
will
no
doubt
desire
to
express
in
person
his
gratitude
and
his
deep
sense
of
the
service
you
have
done
him
i
think
you
may
confidently
expect
to
find
him
as
generous
as
you
he
pocketed
the
letters
and
raised
a
hand
to
point
at
caryll
this
man
he
inquired
laconically
is
a
spy
of
king
james
he
is
the
messenger
who
bore
my
father
that
letter
from
the
pretender
and
he
would
no
doubt
have
carried
back
the
answer
had
my
father
templeton
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
crossed
to
the
desk
he
sat
down
and
took
up
a
quill
you
can
prove
this
of
course
he
said
testing
the
point
of
his
quill
upon
his
abundantly
was
the
ready
answer
my
mother
can
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
was
he
brought
the
pretender
letter
and
there
is
no
lack
of
corroboration
enough
i
think
would
be
afforded
by
the
assault
made
by
this
rogue
upon
green
of
which
no
doubt
you
are
already
informed
sir
his
object
this
proved
object
was
to
possess
himself
of
those
papers
that
he
might
destroy
them
i
but
caught
him
in
time
as
my
servants
can
bear
witness
as
they
can
also
bear
witness
to
the
circumstance
that
we
were
compelled
to
force
an
entrance
here
and
to
use
force
to
him
to
obtain
the
letters
from
templeton
nodded
is
a
clear
case
then
said
he
and
dipped
his
pen
and
yet
put
in
caryll
in
an
indolent
musing
voice
it
might
be
made
to
look
as
clear
another
templeton
scowled
at
him
the
opportunity
shall
be
afforded
you
said
he
meanwhile
what
is
your
name
caryll
looked
whimsically
at
the
secretary
a
moment
then
flung
his
bomb
i
am
justin
caryll
sixth
earl
of
ostermore
and
your
very
humble
servant
the
effect
was
ludicrous
from
caryll
point
of
view
and
yet
it
was
disappointing
five
pairs
of
dilating
eyes
confronted
him
five
gaping
mouths
then
her
ladyship
broke
into
a
laugh
the
creature
mad
i
long
suspected
and
she
meant
to
be
taken
literally
his
many
whimsicalities
were
explained
to
her
at
last
he
was
indeed
as
he
now
proved
templeton
recovering
smote
the
table
angrily
he
thought
he
had
good
reason
to
lose
his
on
this
occasion
though
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
with
him
that
he
could
always
preserve
an
unruffled
calm
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
what
is
your
name
sir
he
demanded
again
you
are
hard
of
hearing
sir
i
think
i
am
lord
ostermore
set
down
that
name
in
the
warrant
if
you
are
determined
to
be
bubbled
by
that
fellow
there
and
made
to
look
foolish
afterwards
with
my
lord
templeton
sat
back
in
his
chair
frowning
but
more
from
utter
bewilderment
now
than
anger
perhaps
said
caryll
if
i
were
to
explain
it
would
help
you
to
see
the
imposture
that
is
being
practiced
upon
you
as
for
the
allegations
that
have
been
made
against
me
that
i
am
a
jacobite
spy
and
an
agent
of
the
pretender
he
shrugged
and
waved
an
airy
hand
i
scarce
think
there
will
remain
the
need
for
me
to
deny
them
when
you
have
heard
the
rotherby
took
a
step
forward
his
face
purple
his
hands
clenched
her
ladyship
thrust
out
a
bony
claw
clutched
at
his
sleeve
and
drew
him
back
and
into
the
chair
beside
her
pho
charles
she
said
give
the
fool
rope
and
he
hang
himself
never
doubt
it
the
poor
witless
caryll
sauntered
over
to
the
secretaire
and
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
top
of
it
facing
all
in
the
room
i
admit
secretary
said
he
that
i
had
occasion
to
assault
green
to
the
end
that
i
might
possess
myself
of
the
papers
he
was
seeking
in
this
why
then
began
templeton
patience
sir
i
admit
so
much
but
i
admit
no
more
i
do
not
for
instance
admit
that
the
object
the
object
itself
of
my
search
was
such
as
has
been
what
then
what
else
growled
rotherby
ay
sir
what
else
quoth
templeton
sir
said
caryll
with
a
sorrowful
shake
of
the
head
i
have
already
startled
you
it
seems
by
one
statement
i
beg
that
you
will
prepare
yourself
to
be
startled
by
then
he
abruptly
dropped
his
languor
i
should
think
twice
sir
he
advised
before
signing
that
warrant
were
i
in
your
place
to
do
so
would
be
to
render
yourself
the
tool
of
those
who
are
plotting
my
ruin
and
ready
to
bear
false
witness
that
they
may
accomplish
it
i
refer
and
he
waved
a
hand
towards
the
countess
and
his
brother
to
the
late
lord
mistress
and
his
natural
son
in
their
utter
stupefaction
at
the
unexpectedness
and
seeming
wildness
of
the
statement
neither
mother
nor
son
could
find
a
word
to
say
no
more
could
templeton
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
wrathfully
what
are
you
saying
sir
he
roared
the
truth
the
truth
echoed
the
secretary
ay
sir
the
truth
have
ye
never
heard
of
it
templeton
sat
back
again
i
begin
to
think
said
he
surveying
through
narrowing
eyes
the
slender
graceful
figure
before
him
that
her
ladyship
is
right
that
you
are
mad
unless
unless
you
are
mad
of
the
same
madness
that
beset
ulysses
you
remember
let
us
have
done
cried
rotherby
in
a
burst
of
anger
leaping
to
his
feet
let
us
have
done
i
say
are
we
to
waste
the
day
upon
this
tom
o
bedlam
write
him
down
as
caryll
justin
caryll
is
the
name
known
by
and
let
green
see
to
the
templeton
made
an
impatient
sound
and
poised
his
pen
ye
are
not
to
suppose
sir
caryll
stayed
him
that
i
can
not
support
my
statements
i
have
by
me
proofs
irrefragable
proofs
of
what
i
proofs
the
word
seemed
to
come
from
every
member
of
that
little
assembly
if
we
except
green
whose
face
was
beginning
to
betray
his
uneasiness
he
was
not
so
ready
as
the
others
to
believe
that
caryll
was
mad
for
him
the
situation
asked
some
other
explanation
ay
proofs
said
caryll
he
had
drawn
the
case
from
his
pocket
again
from
this
he
took
the
and
placed
it
before
templeton
will
you
glance
at
that
sir
to
begin
with
templeton
complied
his
face
became
more
and
more
grave
he
looked
at
caryll
then
at
rotherby
who
was
scowling
and
at
her
ladyship
who
was
breathing
hard
his
glance
returned
to
caryll
you
are
the
person
designated
here
he
inquired
as
i
can
abundantly
prove
said
caryll
i
have
no
lack
of
friends
in
london
who
will
bear
witness
to
that
yet
said
templeton
frowning
perplexed
this
does
not
make
you
what
you
claim
to
be
rather
does
it
show
you
to
be
his
late
lordship
there
more
to
come
said
caryll
and
placed
another
document
before
the
secretary
it
was
an
extract
from
the
register
of
etienne
of
maligny
relating
to
his
mother
death
do
you
know
sir
in
what
year
this
lady
went
through
a
ceremony
of
marriage
with
my
father
the
late
lord
ostermore
it
was
in
i
think
as
the
lady
will
no
doubt
to
what
purpose
this
quoth
templeton
the
purpose
will
be
presently
apparent
observe
that
date
said
caryll
and
he
pointed
to
the
document
in
templeton
hand
templeton
read
the
date
aloud
and
then
the
name
of
the
deceased
antoinette
de
beaulieu
de
maligny
what
of
it
he
demanded
you
will
understand
that
when
i
show
you
the
paper
i
took
from
this
desk
the
paper
that
i
obtained
as
a
consequence
of
my
violence
to
green
i
think
you
will
consider
sir
that
if
ever
the
end
justified
the
means
it
did
so
in
this
case
here
was
something
very
different
from
the
paltry
matter
of
treason
that
is
alleged
against
and
he
passed
the
secretary
a
third
paper
over
templeton
shoulder
rotherby
and
his
mother
who
drawn
by
the
overpowering
excitement
that
was
mastering
them
had
approached
in
silence
were
examining
the
document
with
startled
eyes
fearing
by
very
instinct
without
yet
apprehending
the
true
nature
of
the
revelation
that
was
to
come
god
shrieked
her
ladyship
who
took
in
the
meaning
of
this
thing
before
rotherby
had
begun
to
suspect
it
is
a
forgery
that
were
idle
when
the
original
entry
in
the
register
is
to
be
seen
in
the
church
of
antoine
madam
answered
caryll
i
rescued
that
document
together
with
some
letters
which
my
mother
wrote
my
father
when
first
he
returned
to
england
and
which
are
superfluous
now
from
a
secret
drawer
in
that
desk
an
hour
but
what
is
it
inquired
rotherby
huskily
what
is
it
it
is
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
my
father
the
late
lord
ostermore
and
my
mother
antoinette
de
maligny
at
the
church
of
antoine
in
paris
in
the
year
he
turned
to
templeton
you
apprehend
the
matter
sir
he
demanded
and
recapitulated
in
they
were
married
in
she
died
yet
in
his
lordship
went
through
a
form
of
marriage
with
mistress
sylvia
etheridge
templeton
nodded
very
gravely
his
eyes
upon
the
document
before
him
that
they
might
avoid
meeting
at
that
moment
the
eyes
of
the
woman
whom
the
world
had
always
known
as
the
countess
of
ostermore
fortunate
is
it
for
me
said
caryll
that
i
should
have
possessed
myself
of
these
proofs
in
time
does
it
need
more
to
show
how
urgent
might
be
the
need
for
my
suppression
how
little
faith
can
be
attached
to
an
accusation
levelled
against
me
from
such
a
quarter
by
god
began
rotherby
but
his
mother
clutched
his
wrist
be
still
fool
she
hissed
in
his
ear
she
had
need
to
keep
her
wits
about
her
to
think
to
weigh
each
word
that
she
might
utter
an
abyss
had
opened
in
her
path
a
false
step
and
she
and
her
son
were
irrevocably
lost
sent
headlong
to
destruction
rotherby
already
reduced
to
the
last
stage
of
fear
was
obedient
as
he
had
never
been
and
fell
silent
instantly
templeton
folded
the
papers
rose
and
proffered
them
to
their
owner
have
you
any
means
of
proving
that
this
was
the
document
you
sought
he
inquired
i
can
prove
that
it
was
the
document
he
it
was
hortensia
who
spoke
she
had
advanced
to
her
lover
side
and
she
controlled
her
amazement
to
bear
witness
for
him
i
was
present
in
this
room
when
he
went
through
that
desk
as
all
in
the
house
know
and
i
can
swear
to
his
having
found
that
paper
in
templeton
bowed
my
lord
he
said
to
caryll
your
contentions
appear
clear
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
fear
i
can
go
no
further
nor
do
i
now
think
that
the
secretary
of
state
would
approve
of
my
issuing
a
warrant
upon
such
testimony
as
we
have
received
the
matter
is
one
for
lord
carteret
i
shall
do
myself
the
honor
of
waiting
upon
his
lordship
within
the
hour
said
the
new
lord
ostermore
as
for
the
letter
which
it
is
alleged
i
brought
from
france
from
the
pretender
he
was
smiling
now
a
regretful
deprecatory
smile
it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
being
suspected
by
that
very
man
green
who
stands
yonder
i
was
subjected
upon
my
arrival
in
england
to
a
thorough
search
at
maidstone
a
search
it
goes
without
saying
that
yielded
nothing
i
was
angry
at
the
time
at
the
indignity
i
was
forced
to
endure
we
little
know
what
the
future
may
hold
and
i
am
thankful
to
have
that
evidence
to
rebut
this
your
lordship
is
indeed
to
be
congratulated
templeton
agreed
you
are
thus
in
a
position
to
clear
yourself
of
even
a
shadow
of
you
fool
cried
she
who
until
that
hour
had
been
countess
of
ostermore
turning
fiercely
upon
templeton
you
fool
madam
this
is
not
seemly
cried
the
second
secretary
with
awkward
dignity
seemly
idiot
she
stormed
at
him
i
swear
as
i
a
soul
to
be
saved
that
in
spite
of
all
this
i
know
that
man
to
be
a
traitor
and
a
jacobite
that
it
was
the
letter
from
the
king
he
sought
whatever
he
may
pretend
to
have
templeton
looked
at
her
in
sorrow
for
all
that
in
her
overwrought
condition
she
insulted
him
madam
you
might
swear
and
swear
and
yet
no
one
would
believe
you
in
the
face
of
the
facts
that
have
come
to
do
you
believe
me
she
demanded
angrily
my
beliefs
can
matter
nothing
he
compromised
and
made
her
a
valedictory
bow
your
servant
said
he
from
force
of
habit
he
nodded
to
rotherby
took
up
his
hat
and
cane
and
strode
to
the
door
which
green
had
made
haste
to
open
for
him
from
the
threshold
he
bowed
to
caryll
my
lord
said
he
i
shall
go
straight
to
lord
carteret
he
will
stay
for
you
till
you
i
shall
not
keep
his
lordship
waiting
answered
caryll
and
bowed
in
his
turn
the
second
secretary
went
out
green
hesitated
a
moment
then
abruptly
followed
him
the
game
was
ended
here
it
was
played
and
lost
he
saw
and
what
should
such
as
green
be
doing
on
the
losing
side
chapter
xxiii
the
lion
the
game
was
played
and
lost
all
realized
it
and
none
so
keenly
as
hortensia
who
found
it
in
her
gentle
heart
to
pity
the
woman
who
had
never
shown
her
a
kindness
she
set
a
hand
upon
her
lover
arm
what
will
you
do
justin
she
inquired
in
tones
that
seemed
to
plead
for
mercy
for
those
others
for
she
had
not
paused
to
think
as
another
might
have
thought
that
there
was
no
mercy
he
could
show
them
rotherby
and
his
mother
stood
hand
in
hand
it
was
the
woman
who
had
clutched
at
her
son
for
comfort
and
support
in
this
bitter
hour
of
retribution
this
hour
of
the
recoil
upon
themselves
of
all
the
evil
they
had
plotted
caryll
considered
them
a
moment
his
face
a
mask
his
mind
entirely
detached
they
interested
him
profoundly
this
subjugation
of
two
natures
that
in
themselves
were
arrogant
and
cruel
was
a
process
very
engrossing
to
observe
he
tried
to
conjecture
what
they
felt
what
thoughts
they
might
be
harboring
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
sort
of
paralysis
had
fallen
on
their
wits
they
were
stunned
under
the
shock
of
the
blow
he
had
dealt
them
anon
there
would
be
railings
and
to
spare
against
him
against
themselves
against
the
dead
man
above
stairs
against
fate
and
more
besides
for
the
present
there
was
this
horrid
almost
vacuous
calm
presently
the
woman
stirred
instinct
the
instinct
of
the
stricken
beast
to
creep
to
hiding
moved
her
while
reason
was
still
bound
in
lethargy
she
moved
to
step
drawing
at
her
son
hand
come
charles
she
said
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
come
the
touch
and
the
speech
awakened
him
to
life
no
he
cried
harshly
and
shook
his
hand
free
of
hers
it
ends
not
he
looked
almost
as
he
would
fling
himself
upon
his
brother
his
figure
erect
now
defiant
and
menacing
his
face
ashen
his
eyes
wild
it
ends
not
thus
he
repeated
and
his
voice
rang
sinister
no
caryll
agreed
quietly
it
ends
not
he
looked
sadly
from
son
to
mother
it
had
not
even
begun
thus
but
that
you
would
have
it
so
you
would
have
it
i
sought
to
move
you
to
mercy
i
reminded
you
my
brother
of
the
tie
that
bound
us
and
i
would
have
turned
you
from
fratricide
i
would
have
saved
you
from
the
crime
you
meditated
for
it
was
a
fratricide
exclaimed
rotherby
and
laughed
angrily
fratricide
it
was
as
if
he
threatened
it
but
caryll
continued
to
regard
him
sorrowfully
from
his
soul
he
pitied
him
pitied
them
both
not
because
of
their
condition
but
because
of
the
soullessness
behind
it
all
to
him
it
was
truly
tragic
tragic
beyond
anything
that
he
had
ever
known
you
said
some
fine
things
sir
to
templeton
of
your
regard
for
your
father
memory
said
caryll
you
expressed
some
lofty
sentiments
of
filial
piety
which
almost
sounded
true
which
sounded
true
indeed
to
templeton
it
was
out
of
interest
for
your
father
that
you
pleaded
for
the
suppression
of
his
dealings
with
the
south
sea
company
not
for
a
moment
did
you
consider
yourself
or
the
profit
you
should
make
from
such
why
this
demanded
the
mother
fiercely
do
you
rally
us
do
you
turn
the
sword
in
the
wound
now
that
you
have
us
at
your
mercy
now
that
we
are
fallen
from
what
are
you
fallen
caryll
inquired
ah
but
let
that
pass
i
do
not
rally
madam
mockery
is
far
indeed
from
my
he
turned
again
to
rotherby
lord
ostermore
was
a
father
to
you
which
he
never
was
to
me
knew
not
that
he
was
the
sentiments
you
so
beautifully
expressed
to
templeton
are
the
sentiments
that
actuate
me
now
though
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
express
them
it
is
not
that
my
heart
stirs
much
where
my
lord
ostermore
is
concerned
and
yet
for
the
sake
of
the
name
that
is
mine
now
i
shall
leave
england
as
i
came
justin
caryll
neither
more
nor
less
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
there
is
no
slur
upon
my
mother
name
because
her
history
her
supposed
history
was
unknown
see
that
none
ever
falls
on
it
else
shall
you
find
me
pitiless
indeed
see
that
none
ever
falls
on
it
or
i
shall
return
and
drive
home
the
lesson
that
like
antinous
you
learnt
that
the
cup
and
lip
much
ill
may
grow
and
turn
you
naked
upon
a
contemptuous
world
needs
more
be
said
you
understand
i
rotherby
understood
nothing
but
his
mother
keener
wits
began
to
perceive
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
do
you
mean
that
that
we
are
to
to
remain
in
the
station
that
we
believed
our
own
what
else
she
stared
at
him
here
was
a
generosity
so
weak
it
seemed
to
her
as
almost
to
provoke
her
scorn
you
will
leave
your
brother
in
possession
of
the
title
and
what
else
there
may
be
you
think
me
generous
madam
said
he
do
not
misapprehend
me
i
am
not
i
covet
neither
the
title
nor
estates
of
ostermore
their
possession
would
be
a
thorn
in
my
flesh
a
thorn
of
bitter
memory
that
is
one
reason
why
you
should
not
think
me
generous
though
it
is
not
the
reason
why
i
cede
them
i
would
have
you
understand
me
on
this
perhaps
the
last
time
that
we
may
meet
lord
ostermore
my
father
married
you
madam
in
good
she
interrupted
harshly
what
you
say
she
almost
screamed
quivering
with
rage
at
the
very
thought
of
what
her
dead
lord
had
done
he
married
you
in
good
faith
caryll
repeated
quietly
impressively
i
will
make
it
plain
to
you
he
married
you
believing
that
the
he
had
left
in
france
was
dead
for
fear
it
should
come
to
his
father
knowledge
he
kept
that
marriage
secret
from
all
he
durst
not
own
his
marriage
to
his
he
was
not
as
you
may
have
appreciated
in
the
years
you
lived
with
him
a
man
of
any
profound
feeling
for
others
for
himself
he
had
a
prodigiously
profound
feeling
as
you
may
also
have
gathered
that
marriage
in
france
was
troublesome
he
had
come
to
look
upon
it
as
one
of
his
youth
follies
as
he
himself
described
it
to
me
in
this
house
little
knowing
to
whom
he
spoke
when
he
received
the
false
news
of
her
death
for
he
did
receive
such
news
from
the
very
cousin
who
crossed
from
france
to
avenge
her
believing
her
dead
himself
he
rejoiced
at
his
near
escape
from
the
consequences
of
his
folly
nor
was
he
ever
disabused
of
his
error
for
she
had
ceased
to
write
to
him
by
then
and
so
he
married
you
madam
in
good
faith
that
is
the
argument
i
shall
use
with
my
lord
carteret
to
make
him
understand
that
respect
for
my
father
memory
urges
me
to
depart
in
silence
save
for
what
i
must
have
said
to
escape
the
impeachment
with
which
you
threatened
lord
carteret
is
a
man
of
the
world
he
will
understand
the
disturbance
that
must
result
from
the
disclosure
of
the
truth
of
this
affair
he
will
pledge
templeton
to
silence
and
the
truth
madam
will
never
be
disclosed
that
i
think
is
all
by
god
sir
cried
rotherby
that
damned
handsome
of
you
you
epitomize
it
beautifully
said
caryll
with
a
reversion
to
his
habitual
manner
his
mother
however
had
no
words
at
all
she
advanced
a
step
towards
caryll
put
out
her
hands
and
then
portent
of
portents
two
tears
were
seen
to
trickle
down
her
cheeks
playing
havoc
ploughing
furrows
in
the
paint
that
overlaid
them
caryll
stepped
forward
quickly
the
sight
of
those
tears
springing
from
that
heart
withered
by
god
alone
knew
what
blight
washing
their
way
down
those
poor
bedaubed
cheeks
moved
him
to
a
keener
pity
than
anything
he
had
ever
looked
upon
he
took
her
hands
and
pressed
them
a
moment
giving
way
for
once
to
an
impulse
he
could
not
master
she
would
have
kissed
his
own
in
the
abasement
and
gratitude
of
the
moment
but
he
restrained
her
no
more
your
ladyship
said
he
and
by
thus
giving
her
once
more
the
title
she
had
worn
he
seemed
to
reinstate
her
in
the
station
from
which
in
he
had
pulled
her
down
promise
that
you
bear
no
witness
against
me
should
so
much
be
needed
and
i
cry
quits
with
you
without
your
testimony
they
can
not
hurt
me
even
though
they
were
disposed
to
do
so
which
is
scarcely
sir
sir
she
faltered
brokenly
could
you
could
you
suppose
indeed
no
so
no
more
you
do
but
harass
yourself
fare
you
well
my
lady
if
i
may
trespass
for
a
few
moments
longer
upon
the
hospitality
of
stretton
house
i
be
your
the
house
and
all
is
yours
sir
she
reminded
him
there
but
one
thing
in
it
that
i
carry
off
with
me
said
he
he
held
the
door
for
her
she
looked
into
his
face
a
moment
god
keep
you
said
she
with
a
surprising
fervor
in
one
not
at
her
prayers
god
reward
you
for
showing
this
mercy
to
an
old
woman
who
does
not
deserve
so
fare
you
well
madam
he
said
again
bowing
gravely
and
fare
you
well
lord
ostermore
he
added
to
her
son
his
brother
looked
at
him
a
moment
seemed
on
the
point
of
speaking
and
then
taking
his
cue
no
doubt
from
his
mother
attitude
he
held
out
his
hand
caryll
took
it
shook
it
and
let
it
go
after
all
he
bethought
him
the
man
was
his
brother
and
if
his
bearing
was
not
altogether
cordial
it
was
at
least
a
clement
imitation
of
cordiality
he
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
sighed
supreme
relief
he
turned
to
face
hortensia
and
a
smile
broke
like
sunshine
upon
his
face
and
dispelled
the
serious
gloom
of
his
expression
she
sprang
towards
him
come
now
thou
chattel
that
i
am
resolved
to
carry
with
me
from
my
father
house
said
he
she
checked
in
her
approach
is
not
in
such
words
that
i
be
wooed
said
she
a
fig
for
words
he
cried
art
wooed
and
won
confess
you
want
nothing
for
she
informed
him
gravely
one
thing
hortensia
he
amended
one
thing
i
want
i
lack
to
esteem
myself
greater
than
any
king
that
i
like
that
better
she
laughed
and
suddenly
she
was
in
tears
oh
why
do
you
mock
and
that
your
heart
is
on
your
lips
and
nowhere
else
she
asked
him
is
it
your
aim
to
be
accounted
trifling
and
shallow
you
who
can
do
such
things
as
you
have
done
but
now
oh
it
was
noble
you
made
me
very
proud
he
echoed
ah
then
it
must
be
that
you
are
resolved
to
take
this
impudent
fleering
coxcomb
for
a
husband
he
said
rallying
her
with
the
words
she
had
flung
at
him
that
night
in
the
moonlit
croydon
garden
how
i
was
mistook
in
you
quoth
she
he
made
philosophy
is
ever
those
in
whom
we
are
mistook
that
are
best
worth
knowing
he
informed
her
the
man
or
woman
whom
you
can
read
at
sight
is
read
and
done
yet
you
were
not
mistook
in
me
said
she
i
was
he
answered
for
i
deemed
you
what
other
have
you
found
me
she
inquired
he
flung
wide
his
arms
and
bade
her
into
them
here
to
my
heart
he
cried
and
in
your
ear
i
whisper
it
