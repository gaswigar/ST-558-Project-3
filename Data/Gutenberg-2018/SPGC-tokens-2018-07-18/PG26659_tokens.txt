vii
preface
at
most
of
our
american
colleges
there
are
clubs
formed
by
the
students
devoted
to
particular
branches
of
learning
and
these
clubs
have
the
laudable
custom
of
inviting
once
or
twice
a
year
some
maturer
scholar
to
address
them
the
occasion
often
being
made
a
public
one
i
have
from
time
to
time
accepted
such
invitations
and
afterwards
had
my
discourse
printed
in
one
or
other
of
the
reviews
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
these
addresses
might
now
be
worthy
of
collection
in
a
volume
as
they
shed
explanatory
light
upon
each
other
and
taken
together
express
a
tolerably
definite
philosophic
attitude
in
a
very
untechnical
way
were
i
obliged
to
give
a
short
name
to
the
attitude
in
question
i
should
call
it
that
of
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
such
brief
nicknames
are
nowhere
more
misleading
than
in
philosophy
i
say
because
it
is
contented
to
regard
its
most
assured
conclusions
concerning
matters
of
fact
as
hypotheses
liable
to
modification
in
the
course
of
future
experience
and
i
say
because
it
treats
the
doctrine
of
monism
itself
as
an
hypothesis
and
viii
unlike
so
much
of
the
empiricism
that
is
current
under
the
name
of
positivism
or
agnosticism
or
scientific
naturalism
it
does
not
dogmatically
affirm
monism
as
something
with
which
all
experience
has
got
to
square
the
difference
between
monism
and
pluralism
is
perhaps
the
most
pregnant
of
all
the
differences
in
philosophy
the
world
is
a
pluralism
as
we
find
it
its
unity
seems
to
be
that
of
any
collection
and
our
higher
thinking
consists
chiefly
of
an
effort
to
redeem
it
from
that
first
crude
form
postulating
more
unity
than
the
first
experiences
yield
we
also
discover
more
but
absolute
unity
in
spite
of
brilliant
dashes
in
its
direction
still
remains
undiscovered
still
remains
a
ever
not
quite
must
be
the
rationalistic
philosopher
last
confession
concerning
it
after
all
that
reason
can
do
has
been
done
there
still
remains
the
opacity
of
the
finite
facts
as
merely
given
with
most
of
their
peculiarities
mutually
unmediated
and
unexplained
to
the
very
last
there
are
the
various
of
view
which
the
philosopher
must
distinguish
in
discussing
the
world
and
what
is
inwardly
clear
from
one
point
remains
a
bare
externality
and
datum
to
the
other
the
negative
the
alogical
is
never
wholly
banished
something
call
it
fate
chance
freedom
spontaneity
the
devil
what
you
will
is
still
wrong
and
other
and
outside
and
unincluded
from
point
of
view
even
though
you
be
the
greatest
of
philosophers
something
is
always
mere
fact
and
and
there
may
be
in
the
whole
universe
no
one
point
of
view
extant
from
which
this
would
not
be
found
to
be
the
case
reason
as
a
gifted
writer
says
is
ix
but
one
item
in
the
mystery
and
behind
the
proudest
consciousness
that
ever
reigned
reason
and
wonder
blushed
face
to
face
the
inevitable
stales
while
doubt
and
hope
are
sisters
not
unfortunately
the
universe
is
wild
as
a
hawk
wing
nature
is
miracle
all
the
same
returns
not
save
to
bring
the
different
the
slow
round
of
the
engraver
lathe
gains
but
the
breadth
of
a
hair
but
the
difference
is
distributed
back
over
the
whole
curve
never
an
instant
true
ever
not
quite
this
is
pluralism
somewhat
rhapsodically
expressed
he
who
takes
for
his
hypothesis
the
notion
that
it
is
the
permanent
form
of
the
world
is
what
i
call
a
radical
empiricist
for
him
the
crudity
of
experience
remains
an
eternal
element
thereof
there
is
no
possible
point
of
view
from
which
the
world
can
appear
an
absolutely
single
fact
real
possibilities
real
indeterminations
real
beginnings
real
ends
real
evil
real
crises
catastrophes
and
escapes
a
real
god
and
a
real
moral
life
just
as
conceives
these
things
may
remain
in
empiricism
as
conceptions
which
that
philosophy
gives
up
the
attempt
either
to
or
to
reinterpret
in
monistic
form
many
of
my
professionally
trained
will
smile
at
the
irrationalism
of
this
view
and
at
the
artlessness
of
my
essays
in
point
of
technical
form
but
they
should
be
taken
as
illustrations
of
the
radically
empiricist
attitude
rather
than
as
argumentations
for
its
validity
that
admits
meanwhile
of
x
being
argued
in
as
technical
a
shape
as
any
one
can
desire
and
possibly
i
may
be
spared
to
do
later
a
share
of
that
work
meanwhile
these
essays
seem
to
light
up
with
a
certain
dramatic
reality
the
attitude
itself
and
make
it
visible
alongside
of
the
higher
and
lower
dogmatisms
between
which
in
the
pages
of
philosophic
history
it
has
generally
remained
eclipsed
from
sight
the
first
four
essays
are
largely
concerned
with
defending
the
legitimacy
of
religious
faith
to
some
rationalizing
readers
such
advocacy
will
seem
a
sad
misuse
of
one
professional
position
mankind
they
will
say
is
only
too
prone
to
follow
faith
unreasoningly
and
needs
no
preaching
nor
encouragement
in
that
direction
i
quite
agree
that
what
mankind
at
large
most
lacks
is
criticism
and
caution
not
faith
its
cardinal
weakness
is
to
let
belief
follow
recklessly
upon
lively
conception
especially
when
the
conception
has
instinctive
liking
at
its
back
i
admit
then
that
were
i
addressing
the
salvation
army
or
a
miscellaneous
popular
crowd
it
would
be
a
misuse
of
opportunity
to
preach
the
liberty
of
believing
as
i
have
in
these
pages
preached
it
what
such
audiences
most
need
is
that
their
faiths
should
be
broken
up
and
ventilated
that
the
northwest
wind
of
science
should
get
into
them
and
blow
their
sickliness
and
barbarism
away
but
academic
audiences
fed
already
on
science
have
a
very
different
need
paralysis
of
their
native
capacity
for
faith
and
timorous
in
the
religious
field
are
their
special
forms
of
mental
weakness
brought
about
by
the
notion
carefully
instilled
that
there
is
something
called
scientific
evidence
by
xi
waiting
upon
which
they
shall
escape
all
danger
of
shipwreck
in
regard
to
truth
but
there
is
really
no
scientific
or
other
method
by
which
men
can
steer
safely
between
the
opposite
dangers
of
believing
too
little
or
of
believing
too
much
to
face
such
dangers
is
apparently
our
duty
and
to
hit
the
right
channel
between
them
is
the
measure
of
our
wisdom
as
men
it
does
not
follow
because
recklessness
may
be
a
vice
in
soldiers
that
courage
ought
never
to
be
preached
to
them
what
be
preached
is
courage
weighted
with
responsibility
such
courage
as
the
nelsons
and
washingtons
never
failed
to
show
after
they
had
taken
everything
into
account
that
might
tell
against
their
success
and
made
every
provision
to
minimize
disaster
in
case
they
met
defeat
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
can
accuse
me
of
preaching
reckless
faith
i
have
preached
the
right
of
the
individual
to
indulge
his
personal
faith
at
his
personal
risk
i
have
discussed
the
kinds
of
risk
i
have
contended
that
none
of
us
escape
all
of
them
and
i
have
only
pleaded
that
it
is
better
to
face
them
than
to
act
as
if
we
did
not
know
them
to
be
there
after
all
though
you
will
say
why
such
an
ado
about
a
matter
concerning
which
however
we
may
theoretically
differ
we
all
practically
agree
in
this
age
of
toleration
no
scientist
will
ever
try
actively
to
interfere
with
our
religious
faith
provided
we
enjoy
it
quietly
with
our
friends
and
do
not
make
a
public
nuisance
of
it
in
the
but
it
is
just
on
this
matter
of
the
that
i
think
the
utility
of
such
essays
as
mine
may
turn
if
xii
religious
hypotheses
about
the
universe
be
in
order
at
all
then
the
active
faiths
of
individuals
in
them
freely
expressing
themselves
in
life
are
the
experimental
tests
by
which
they
are
verified
and
the
only
means
by
which
their
truth
or
falsehood
can
be
wrought
out
the
truest
scientific
hypothesis
is
that
which
as
we
say
best
and
it
can
be
no
otherwise
with
religious
hypotheses
religious
history
proves
that
one
hypothesis
after
another
has
worked
ill
has
crumbled
at
contact
with
a
widening
knowledge
of
the
world
and
has
lapsed
from
the
minds
of
men
some
articles
of
faith
however
have
maintained
themselves
through
every
vicissitude
and
possess
even
more
vitality
than
ever
before
it
is
for
the
of
to
tell
us
just
which
hypotheses
these
are
meanwhile
the
freest
competition
of
the
various
faiths
with
one
another
and
their
openest
application
to
life
by
their
several
champions
are
the
most
favorable
conditions
under
which
the
survival
of
the
fittest
can
proceed
they
ought
therefore
not
to
lie
hid
each
under
its
bushel
quietly
with
friends
they
ought
to
live
in
publicity
vying
with
each
other
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
r√©gime
of
tolerance
once
granted
and
a
fair
field
shown
the
scientist
has
nothing
to
fear
for
his
own
interests
from
the
liveliest
possible
state
of
fermentation
in
the
religious
world
of
his
time
those
faiths
will
best
stand
the
test
which
adopt
also
his
hypotheses
and
make
them
integral
elements
of
their
own
he
should
welcome
therefore
every
species
of
religious
agitation
and
discussion
so
long
as
he
is
willing
to
allow
that
some
religious
hypothesis
be
xiii
true
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
scientists
who
would
deny
that
dogmatically
maintaining
that
science
has
already
ruled
all
possible
religious
hypotheses
out
of
court
such
scientists
ought
i
agree
to
aim
at
imposing
privacy
on
religious
faiths
the
public
manifestation
of
which
could
only
be
a
nuisance
in
their
eyes
with
all
such
scientists
as
well
as
with
their
allies
outside
of
science
my
quarrel
openly
lies
and
i
hope
that
my
book
may
do
something
to
persuade
the
reader
of
their
crudity
and
range
him
on
my
side
religious
fermentation
is
always
a
symptom
of
the
intellectual
vigor
of
a
society
and
it
is
only
when
they
forget
that
they
are
hypotheses
and
put
on
rationalistic
and
authoritative
pretensions
that
our
faiths
do
harm
the
most
interesting
and
valuable
things
about
a
man
are
his
ideals
and
the
same
is
true
of
nations
and
historic
epochs
and
the
excesses
of
which
the
particular
individuals
and
epochs
are
guilty
are
compensated
in
the
total
and
become
profitable
to
mankind
in
the
long
run
the
essay
some
hegelisms
doubtless
needs
an
apology
for
the
superficiality
with
which
it
treats
a
serious
subject
it
was
written
as
a
squib
to
be
read
in
a
in
hegel
logic
several
of
whose
members
mature
men
were
devout
champions
of
the
dialectical
method
my
blows
therefore
were
aimed
almost
entirely
at
that
i
reprint
the
paper
here
albeit
with
some
misgivings
partly
because
i
believe
the
dialectical
method
to
be
wholly
abominable
when
worked
by
concepts
alone
and
partly
because
the
essay
casts
some
positive
light
on
the
point
of
view
xiv
the
paper
on
psychical
research
is
added
to
the
volume
for
convenience
and
utility
attracted
to
this
study
some
years
ago
by
my
love
of
sportsmanlike
fair
play
in
science
i
have
seen
enough
to
convince
me
of
its
great
importance
and
i
wish
to
gain
for
it
what
interest
i
can
the
american
branch
of
the
society
is
in
need
of
more
support
and
if
my
article
draws
some
new
associates
thereto
it
will
have
served
its
turn
apology
is
also
needed
for
the
repetition
of
the
same
passage
in
two
essays
pp
and
my
excuse
is
that
one
can
not
always
express
the
same
thought
in
two
ways
that
seem
equally
forcible
so
one
has
to
copy
one
former
words
the
on
page
is
due
to
salter
who
employed
it
in
a
similar
manner
in
the
for
august
and
the
on
is
a
reminiscence
from
some
novel
of
george
sand
i
forget
which
read
by
me
thirty
years
ago
finally
the
revision
of
the
essays
has
consisted
almost
entirely
in
excisions
probably
less
than
a
page
and
a

certain
mr
guest
used
to
converse
with
his
pupils
in
this
wise
gurney
what
is
the
difference
between
justification
and
sanctification
stephen
prove
the
omnipotence
of
god
etc
in
the
midst
of
our
harvard
freethinking
and
indifference
we
are
prone
to
imagine
that
here
at
your
good
old
orthodox
college
conversation
continues
to
be
somewhat
upon
this
order
and
to
show
you
that
we
at
harvard
have
not
lost
all
interest
in
these
vital
subjects
i
have
brought
with
me
something
like
a
sermon
on
justification
by
faith
to
read
to
you
i
mean
an
essay
in
justification
faith
a
defence
of
our
right
to
adopt
a
believing
attitude
in
religious
matters
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
our
merely
logical
intellect
may
not
have
been
coerced
will
to
believe
accordingly
is
the
title
of
my
paper
i
have
long
defended
to
my
own
students
the
lawfulness
of
voluntarily
adopted
faith
but
as
soon
as
they
have
got
well
imbued
with
the
logical
spirit
they
have
as
a
rule
refused
to
admit
my
contention
to
be
lawful
philosophically
even
though
in
point
of
fact
they
were
personally
all
the
time
of
some
faith
or
other
themselves
i
am
all
the
while
however
so
profoundly
convinced
that
my
own
position
is
correct
that
your
invitation
has
seemed
to
me
a
good
occasion
to
make
my
statements
more
clear
perhaps
your
minds
will
be
more
open
than
those
with
which
i
have
hitherto
had
to
deal
i
will
be
as
little
technical
as
i
can
though
i
must
begin
by
setting
up
some
technical
distinctions
that
will
help
us
in
the
end
i
let
us
give
the
name
of
to
anything
that
may
be
proposed
to
our
belief
and
just
as
the
electricians
speak
of
live
and
dead
wires
let
us
speak
of
any
hypothesis
as
either
or
a
live
hypothesis
is
one
which
appeals
as
a
real
possibility
to
him
to
whom
it
is
proposed
if
i
ask
you
to
believe
in
the
mahdi
the
notion
makes
no
electric
connection
with
your
nature
it
refuses
to
scintillate
with
any
credibility
at
all
as
an
hypothesis
it
is
completely
dead
to
an
arab
however
even
if
he
be
not
one
of
the
mahdi
followers
the
hypothesis
is
among
the
mind
possibilities
it
is
alive
this
shows
that
deadness
and
liveness
in
an
hypothesis
are
not
intrinsic
properties
but
relations
to
the
individual
thinker
they
are
measured
by
his
willingness
to
act
the
maximum
of
liveness
in
an
hypothesis
means
willingness
to
act
irrevocably
practically
that
means
belief
but
there
is
some
believing
tendency
wherever
there
is
willingness
to
act
at
all
next
let
us
call
the
decision
between
two
hypotheses
an
options
may
be
of
several
kinds
they
may
be
or
or
or
and
for
our
purposes
we
may
call
an
option
a
option
when
it
is
of
the
forced
living
and
momentous
kind
a
living
option
is
one
in
which
both
hypotheses
are
live
ones
if
i
say
to
you
be
a
theosophist
or
be
a
mohammedan
it
is
probably
a
dead
option
because
for
you
neither
hypothesis
is
likely
to
be
alive
but
if
i
say
be
an
agnostic
or
be
a
christian
it
is
otherwise
trained
as
you
are
each
hypothesis
makes
some
appeal
however
small
to
your
belief
next
if
i
say
to
you
choose
between
going
out
with
your
umbrella
or
without
it
i
do
not
offer
you
a
genuine
option
for
it
is
not
forced
you
can
easily
avoid
it
by
not
going
out
at
all
similarly
if
i
say
either
love
me
or
hate
me
either
call
my
theory
true
or
call
it
false
your
option
is
avoidable
you
may
remain
indifferent
to
me
neither
loving
nor
hating
and
you
may
decline
to
offer
any
judgment
as
to
my
theory
but
if
i
say
either
accept
this
truth
or
go
without
it
i
put
on
you
a
forced
option
for
there
is
no
standing
place
outside
of
the
alternative
every
dilemma
based
on
a
complete
logical
disjunction
with
no
possibility
of
not
choosing
is
an
option
of
this
forced
kind
finally
if
i
were
nansen
and
proposed
to
you
to
join
my
north
pole
expedition
your
option
would
be
momentous
for
this
would
probably
be
your
only
similar
opportunity
and
your
choice
now
would
either
exclude
you
from
the
north
pole
sort
of
immortality
altogether
or
put
at
least
the
chance
of
it
into
your
hands
he
who
refuses
to
embrace
a
unique
opportunity
loses
the
prize
as
surely
as
if
he
tried
and
failed
the
option
is
trivial
when
the
opportunity
is
not
unique
when
the
stake
is
insignificant
or
when
the
decision
is
reversible
if
it
later
prove
unwise
such
trivial
options
abound
in
the
scientific
life
a
chemist
finds
an
hypothesis
live
enough
to
spend
a
year
in
its
verification
he
believes
in
it
to
that
extent
but
if
his
experiments
prove
inconclusive
either
way
he
is
quit
for
his
loss
of
time
no
vital
harm
being
done
it
will
facilitate
our
discussion
if
we
keep
all
these
distinctions
well
in
mind
ii
the
next
matter
to
consider
is
the
actual
psychology
of
human
opinion
when
we
look
at
certain
facts
it
seems
as
if
our
passional
and
volitional
nature
lay
at
the
root
of
all
our
convictions
when
we
look
at
others
it
seems
as
if
they
could
do
nothing
when
the
intellect
had
once
said
its
say
let
us
take
the
latter
facts
up
first
does
it
not
seem
preposterous
on
the
very
face
of
it
to
talk
of
our
opinions
being
modifiable
at
will
can
our
will
either
help
or
hinder
our
intellect
in
its
perceptions
of
truth
can
we
by
just
willing
it
believe
that
abraham
lincoln
existence
is
a
myth
and
that
the
portraits
of
him
in
mcclure
magazine
are
all
of
some
one
else
can
we
by
any
effort
of
our
will
or
by
any
strength
of
wish
that
it
were
true
believe
ourselves
well
and
about
when
we
are
roaring
with
rheumatism
in
bed
or
feel
certain
that
the
sum
of
the
two
bills
in
our
pocket
must
be
a
hundred
dollars
we
can
say
any
of
these
things
but
we
are
absolutely
impotent
to
believe
them
and
of
just
such
things
is
the
whole
fabric
of
the
truths
that
we
do
believe
in
made
up
matters
of
fact
immediate
or
remote
as
hume
said
and
relations
between
ideas
which
are
either
there
or
not
there
for
us
if
we
see
them
so
and
which
if
not
there
can
not
be
put
there
by
any
action
of
our
own
in
pascal
thoughts
there
is
a
celebrated
passage
known
in
literature
as
pascal
wager
in
it
he
tries
to
force
us
into
christianity
by
reasoning
as
if
our
concern
with
truth
resembled
our
concern
with
the
stakes
in
a
game
of
chance
translated
freely
his
words
are
these
you
must
either
believe
or
not
believe
that
god
is
which
will
you
do
your
human
reason
can
not
say
a
game
is
going
on
between
you
and
the
nature
of
things
which
at
the
day
of
judgment
will
bring
out
either
heads
or
tails
weigh
what
your
gains
and
your
losses
would
be
if
you
should
stake
all
you
have
on
heads
or
god
existence
if
you
win
in
such
case
you
gain
eternal
beatitude
if
you
lose
you
lose
nothing
at
all
if
there
were
an
infinity
of
chances
and
only
one
for
god
in
this
wager
still
you
ought
to
stake
your
all
on
god
for
though
you
surely
risk
a
finite
loss
by
this
procedure
any
finite
loss
is
reasonable
even
a
certain
one
is
reasonable
if
there
is
but
the
possibility
of
infinite
gain
go
then
and
take
holy
water
and
have
masses
said
belief
will
come
and
stupefy
your
scruples
vous
fera
croire
et
vous
why
should
you
not
at
bottom
what
have
you
to
lose
you
probably
feel
that
when
religious
faith
expresses
itself
thus
in
the
language
of
the
it
is
put
to
its
last
trumps
surely
pascal
own
personal
belief
in
masses
and
holy
water
had
far
other
springs
and
this
celebrated
page
of
his
is
but
an
argument
for
others
a
last
desperate
snatch
at
a
weapon
against
the
hardness
of
the
unbelieving
heart
we
feel
that
a
faith
in
masses
and
holy
water
adopted
wilfully
after
such
a
mechanical
calculation
would
lack
the
inner
soul
of
faith
reality
and
if
we
were
ourselves
in
the
place
of
the
deity
we
should
probably
take
particular
pleasure
in
cutting
off
believers
of
this
pattern
from
their
infinite
reward
it
is
evident
that
unless
there
be
some
tendency
to
believe
in
masses
and
holy
water
the
option
offered
to
the
will
by
pascal
is
not
a
living
option
certainly
no
turk
ever
took
to
masses
and
holy
water
on
its
account
and
even
to
us
protestants
these
means
of
salvation
seem
such
foregone
impossibilities
that
pascal
logic
invoked
for
them
specifically
leaves
us
unmoved
as
well
might
the
mahdi
write
to
us
saying
i
am
the
expected
one
whom
god
has
created
in
his
effulgence
you
shall
be
infinitely
happy
if
you
confess
me
otherwise
you
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
light
of
the
sun
weigh
then
your
infinite
gain
if
i
am
genuine
against
your
finite
sacrifice
if
i
am
not
his
logic
would
be
that
of
pascal
but
he
would
vainly
use
it
on
us
for
the
hypothesis
he
offers
us
is
dead
no
tendency
to
act
on
it
exists
in
us
to
any
degree
the
talk
of
believing
by
our
volition
seems
then
from
one
point
of
view
simply
silly
from
another
point
of
view
it
is
worse
than
silly
it
is
vile
when
one
turns
to
the
magnificent
edifice
of
the
physical
sciences
and
sees
how
it
was
reared
what
thousands
of
disinterested
moral
lives
of
men
lie
buried
in
its
mere
foundations
what
patience
and
postponement
what
choking
down
of
preference
what
submission
to
the
icy
laws
of
outer
fact
are
wrought
into
its
very
stones
and
mortar
how
absolutely
impersonal
it
stands
in
its
vast
augustness
then
how
besotted
and
contemptible
seems
every
little
sentimentalist
who
comes
blowing
his
voluntary
and
pretending
to
decide
things
from
out
of
his
private
dream
can
we
wonder
if
those
bred
in
the
rugged
and
manly
school
of
science
should
feel
like
spewing
such
subjectivism
out
of
their
mouths
the
whole
system
of
loyalties
which
grow
up
in
the
schools
of
science
go
dead
against
its
toleration
so
that
it
is
only
natural
that
those
who
have
caught
the
scientific
fever
should
pass
over
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
write
sometimes
as
if
the
incorruptibly
truthful
intellect
ought
positively
to
prefer
bitterness
and
unacceptableness
to
the
heart
in
its
cup
it
fortifies
my
soul
to
know
that
though
i
perish
truth
is
so
sings
clough
while
huxley
exclaims
my
only
consolation
lies
in
the
reflection
that
however
bad
our
posterity
may
become
so
far
as
they
hold
by
the
plain
rule
of
not
pretending
to
believe
what
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
because
it
may
be
to
their
advantage
so
to
pretend
the
word
is
surely
here
redundant
they
will
not
have
reached
the
lowest
depth
of
immorality
and
that
delicious
clifford
writes
belief
is
desecrated
when
given
to
unproved
and
unquestioned
statements
for
the
solace
and
private
pleasure
of
the
believer
whoso
would
deserve
well
of
his
fellows
in
this
matter
will
guard
the
purity
of
his
belief
with
a
very
fanaticism
of
jealous
care
lest
at
any
time
it
should
rest
on
an
unworthy
object
and
catch
a
stain
which
can
never
be
wiped
away
if
a
belief
has
been
accepted
on
insufficient
evidence
even
though
the
belief
be
true
as
clifford
on
the
same
page
explains
the
pleasure
is
a
stolen
one
it
is
sinful
because
it
is
stolen
in
defiance
of
our
duty
to
mankind
that
duty
is
to
guard
ourselves
from
such
beliefs
as
from
a
pestilence
which
may
shortly
master
our
own
body
and
then
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
town
it
is
wrong
always
everywhere
and
for
every
one
to
believe
anything
upon
insufficient
evidence
iii
all
this
strikes
one
as
healthy
even
when
expressed
as
by
clifford
with
somewhat
too
much
of
robustious
pathos
in
the
voice
and
simple
wishing
do
seem
in
the
matter
of
our
credences
to
be
only
fifth
wheels
to
the
coach
yet
if
any
one
should
thereupon
assume
that
intellectual
insight
is
what
remains
after
wish
and
will
and
sentimental
preference
have
taken
wing
or
that
pure
reason
is
what
then
settles
our
opinions
he
would
fly
quite
as
directly
in
the
teeth
of
the
facts
it
is
only
our
already
dead
hypotheses
that
our
willing
nature
is
unable
to
bring
to
life
again
but
what
has
made
them
dead
for
us
is
for
the
most
part
a
previous
action
of
our
willing
nature
of
an
antagonistic
kind
when
i
say
nature
i
do
not
mean
only
such
deliberate
volitions
as
may
have
set
up
habits
of
belief
that
we
can
not
now
escape
from
i
mean
all
such
factors
of
belief
as
fear
and
hope
prejudice
and
passion
imitation
and
partisanship
the
circumpressure
of
our
caste
and
set
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
find
ourselves
believing
we
hardly
know
how
or
why
balfour
gives
the
name
of
to
all
those
influences
born
of
the
intellectual
climate
that
make
hypotheses
possible
or
impossible
for
us
alive
or
dead
here
in
this
room
we
all
of
us
believe
in
molecules
and
the
conservation
of
energy
in
democracy
and
necessary
progress
in
protestant
christianity
and
the
duty
of
fighting
for
doctrine
of
the
immortal
monroe
all
for
no
reasons
worthy
of
the
name
we
see
into
these
matters
with
no
more
inner
clearness
and
probably
with
much
less
than
any
disbeliever
in
them
might
possess
his
unconventionality
would
probably
have
some
grounds
to
show
for
its
conclusions
but
for
us
not
insight
but
the
of
the
opinions
is
what
makes
the
spark
shoot
from
them
and
light
up
our
sleeping
magazines
of
faith
our
reason
is
quite
satisfied
in
nine
hundred
and
cases
out
of
every
thousand
of
us
if
it
can
find
a
few
arguments
that
will
do
to
recite
in
case
our
credulity
is
criticised
by
some
one
else
our
faith
is
faith
in
some
one
faith
and
in
the
greatest
matters
this
is
most
the
case
our
belief
in
truth
itself
for
instance
that
there
is
a
truth
and
that
our
minds
and
it
are
made
for
each
other
what
is
it
but
a
passionate
affirmation
of
desire
in
which
our
social
system
backs
us
up
we
want
to
have
a
truth
we
want
to
believe
that
our
experiments
and
studies
and
discussions
must
put
us
in
a
continually
better
and
better
position
towards
it
and
on
this
line
we
agree
to
fight
out
our
thinking
lives
but
if
a
pyrrhonistic
sceptic
asks
us
we
all
this
can
our
logic
find
a
reply
no
certainly
it
can
not
it
is
just
one
volition
against
another
we
willing
to
go
in
for
life
upon
a
trust
or
assumption
which
he
for
his
part
does
not
care
to
make
as
a
rule
we
disbelieve
all
facts
and
theories
for
which
we
have
no
use
clifford
cosmic
emotions
find
no
use
for
christian
feelings
huxley
belabors
the
bishops
because
there
is
no
use
for
sacerdotalism
in
his
scheme
of
life
newman
on
the
contrary
goes
over
to
romanism
and
finds
all
sorts
of
reasons
good
for
staying
there
because
a
priestly
system
is
for
him
an
organic
need
and
delight
why
do
so
few
even
look
at
the
evidence
for
telepathy
so
called
because
they
think
as
a
leading
biologist
now
dead
once
said
to
me
that
even
if
such
a
thing
were
true
scientists
ought
to
band
together
to
keep
it
suppressed
and
concealed
it
would
undo
the
uniformity
of
nature
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
without
which
scientists
can
not
carry
on
their
pursuits
but
if

man
had
been
shown
something
which
as
a
scientist
he
might
with
telepathy
he
might
not
only
have
examined
the
evidence
but
even
have
found
it
good
enough
this
very
law
which
the
logicians
would
impose
upon
us
if
i
may
give
the
name
of
logicians
to
those
who
would
rule
out
our
willing
nature
here
is
based
on
nothing
but
their
own
natural
wish
to
exclude
all
elements
for
which
they
in
their
professional
quality
of
logicians
can
find
no
use
evidently
then
our
nature
does
influence
our
convictions
there
are
passional
tendencies
and
volitions
which
run
before
and
others
which
come
after
belief
and
it
is
only
the
latter
that
are
too
late
for
the
fair
and
they
are
not
too
late
when
the
previous
passional
work
has
been
already
in
their
own
direction
pascal
argument
instead
of
being
powerless
then
seems
a
regular
clincher
and
is
the
last
stroke
needed
to
make
our
faith
in
masses
and
holy
water
complete
the
state
of
things
is
evidently
far
from
simple
and
pure
insight
and
logic
whatever
they
might
do
ideally
are
not
the
only
things
that
really
do
produce
our
creeds
iv
our
next
duty
having
recognized
this
state
of
affairs
is
to
ask
whether
it
be
simply
reprehensible
and
pathological
or
whether
on
the
contrary
we
must
treat
it
as
a
normal
element
in
making
up
our
minds
the
thesis
i
defend
is
briefly
stated
this
passional
nature
not
only
lawfully
may
but
must
decide
an
option
between
propositions
whenever
it
is
a
genuine
option
that
can
not
by
its
nature
be
decided
on
intellectual
grounds
for
to
say
under
such
circumstances
do
not
decide
but
leave
the
question
open
is
itself
a
passional
decision
just
like
deciding
yes
or
no
and
is
attended
with
the
same
risk
of
losing
the
the
thesis
thus
abstractly
expressed
will
i
trust
soon
become
quite
clear
but
i
must
first
indulge
in
a
bit
more
of
preliminary
work
it
will
be
observed
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
we
are
on
ground
ground
i
mean
which
leaves
systematic
philosophical
scepticism
altogether
out
of
account
the
postulate
that
there
is
truth
and
that
it
is
the
destiny
of
our
minds
to
attain
it
we
are
deliberately
resolving
to
make
though
the
sceptic
will
not
make
it
we
part
company
with
him
therefore
absolutely
at
this
point
but
the
faith
that
truth
exists
and
that
our
minds
can
find
it
may
be
held
in
two
ways
we
may
talk
of
the
way
and
of
the
way
of
believing
in
truth
the
absolutists
in
this
matter
say
that
we
not
only
can
attain
to
knowing
truth
but
we
can
we
have
attained
to
knowing
it
while
the
empiricists
think
that
although
we
may
attain
it
we
can
not
infallibly
know
when
to
is
one
thing
and
to
know
for
certain
we
know
is
another
one
may
hold
to
the
first
being
possible
without
the
second
hence
the
empiricists
and
the
absolutists
although
neither
of
them
is
a
sceptic
in
the
usual
philosophic
sense
of
the
term
show
very
different
degrees
of
dogmatism
in
their
lives
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
opinions
we
see
that
the
empiricist
tendency
has
largely
prevailed
in
science
while
in
philosophy
the
absolutist
tendency
has
had
everything
its
own
way
the
characteristic
sort
of
happiness
indeed
which
philosophies
yield
has
mainly
consisted
in
the
conviction
felt
by
each
successive
school
or
system
that
by
it
had
been
attained
other
philosophies
are
collections
of
opinions
mostly
false
philosophy
gives
forever
who
does
not
recognize
in
this
the
of
every
system
worthy
of
the
name
a
system
to
be
a
system
at
all
must
come
as
a
system
reversible
in
this
or
that
detail
perchance
but
in
its
essential
features
never
scholastic
orthodoxy
to
which
one
must
always
go
when
one
wishes
to
find
perfectly
clear
statement
has
beautifully
elaborated
this
absolutist
conviction
in
a
doctrine
which
it
calls
that
of
evidence
if
for
example
i
am
unable
to
doubt
that
i
now
exist
before
you
that
two
is
less
than
three
or
that
if
all
men
are
mortal
then
i
am
mortal
too
it
is
because
these
things
illumine
my
intellect
irresistibly
the
final
ground
of
this
objective
evidence
possessed
by
certain
propositions
is
the
intellect√ªs
nostri
cum
the
certitude
it
brings
involves
an
ad
extorquendum
certum
on
the
part
of
the
truth
envisaged
and
on
the
side
of
the
subject
a
in
when
once
the
object
is
mentally
received
that
leaves
no
possibility
of
doubt
behind
and
in
the
whole
transaction
nothing
operates
but
the
of
the
object
and
the
of
the
mind
we
slouchy
modern
thinkers
dislike
to
talk
in
latin
indeed
we
dislike
to
talk
in
set
terms
at
all
but
at
bottom
our
own
state
of
mind
is
very
much
like
this
whenever
we
uncritically
abandon
ourselves
you
believe
in
objective
evidence
and
i
do
of
some
things
we
feel
that
we
are
certain
we
know
and
we
know
that
we
do
know
there
is
something
that
gives
a
click
inside
of
us
a
bell
that
strikes
twelve
when
the
hands
of
our
mental
clock
have
swept
the
dial
and
meet
over
the
meridian
hour
the
greatest
empiricists
among
us
are
only
empiricists
on
reflection
when
left
to
their
instincts
they
dogmatize
like
infallible
popes
when
the
cliffords
tell
us
how
sinful
it
is
to
be
christians
on
such
evidence
insufficiency
is
really
the
last
thing
they
have
in
mind
for
them
the
evidence
is
absolutely
sufficient
only
it
makes
the
other
way
they
believe
so
completely
in
an
order
of
the
universe
that
there
is
no
living
option
christianity
is
a
dead
hypothesis
from
the
start
vi
but
now
since
we
are
all
such
absolutists
by
instinct
what
in
our
quality
of
students
of
philosophy
ought
we
to
do
about
the
fact
shall
we
espouse
and
indorse
it
or
shall
we
treat
it
as
a
weakness
of
our
nature
from
which
we
must
free
ourselves
if
we
can
i
sincerely
believe
that
the
latter
course
is
the
only
one
we
can
follow
as
reflective
men
objective
evidence
and
certitude
are
doubtless
very
fine
ideals
to
play
with
but
where
on
this
moonlit
and
planet
are
they
found
i
am
therefore
myself
a
complete
empiricist
so
far
as
my
theory
of
human
knowledge
goes
i
live
to
be
sure
by
the
practical
faith
that
we
must
go
on
experiencing
and
thinking
over
our
experience
for
only
thus
can
our
opinions
grow
more
true
but
to
hold
any
one
of
them
i
absolutely
do
not
care
which
as
if
it
never
could
be
reinterpretable
or
corrigible
i
believe
to
be
a
tremendously
mistaken
attitude
and
i
think
that
the
whole
history
of
philosophy
will
bear
me
out
there
is
but
one
indefectibly
certain
truth
and
that
is
the
truth
that
pyrrhonistic
scepticism
itself
leaves
standing
the
truth
that
the
present
phenomenon
of
consciousness
exists
that
however
is
the
bare
of
knowledge
the
mere
admission
of
a
stuff
to
be
philosophized
about
the
various
philosophies
are
but
so
many
attempts
at
expressing
what
this
stuff
really
is
and
if
we
repair
to
our
libraries
what
disagreement
do
we
discover
where
is
a
certainly
true
answer
found
apart
from
abstract
propositions
of
comparison
such
as
two
and
two
are
the
same
as
four
propositions
which
tell
us
nothing
by
themselves
about
concrete
reality
we
find
no
proposition
ever
regarded
by
any
one
as
evidently
certain
that
has
not
either
been
called
a
falsehood
or
at
least
had
its
truth
sincerely
questioned
by
some
one
else
the
transcending
of
the
axioms
of
geometry
not
in
play
but
in
earnest
by
certain
of
our
contemporaries
as
z√∂llner
and
charles
hinton
and
the
rejection
of
the
whole
aristotelian
logic
by
the
hegelians
are
striking
instances
in
point
no
concrete
test
of
what
is
really
true
has
ever
been
agreed
upon
some
make
the
criterion
external
to
the
moment
of
perception
putting
it
either
in
revelation
the
the
instincts
of
the
heart
or
the
systematized
experience
of
the
race
others
make
the
perceptive
moment
its
own
test
descartes
for
instance
with
his
clear
and
distinct
ideas
guaranteed
by
the
veracity
of
god
reid
with
his
and
kant
with
his
forms
of
synthetic
judgment
the
inconceivability
of
the
opposite
the
capacity
to
be
verified
by
sense
the
possession
of
complete
organic
unity
or
realized
when
a
thing
is
its
own
other
are
standards
which
in
turn
have
been
used
the
much
lauded
objective
evidence
is
never
triumphantly
there
it
is
a
mere
aspiration
or
marking
the
infinitely
remote
ideal
of
our
thinking
life
to
claim
that
certain
truths
now
possess
it
is
simply
to
say
that
when
you
think
them
true
and
they
true
then
their
evidence
is
objective
otherwise
it
is
not
but
practically
one
conviction
that
the
evidence
one
goes
by
is
of
the
real
objective
brand
is
only
one
more
subjective
opinion
added
to
the
lot
for
what
a
contradictory
array
of
opinions
have
objective
evidence
and
absolute
certitude
been
claimed
the
world
is
rational
through
and
through
its
existence
is
an
ultimate
brute
fact
there
is
a
personal
god
a
personal
god
is
inconceivable
there
is
an
physical
world
immediately
known
the
mind
can
only
know
its
own
ideas
a
moral
imperative
exists
obligation
is
only
the
resultant
of
desires
a
permanent
spiritual
principle
is
in
every
one
there
are
only
shifting
states
of
mind
there
is
an
endless
chain
of
causes
there
is
an
absolute
first
cause
an
eternal
necessity
a
freedom
a
purpose
no
purpose
a
primal
one
a
primal
many
a
universal
continuity
an
essential
discontinuity
in
things
an
infinity
no
infinity
there
is
this
there
is
that
there
is
indeed
nothing
which
some
one
has
not
thought
absolutely
true
while
his
neighbor
deemed
it
absolutely
false
and
not
an
absolutist
among
them
seems
ever
to
have
considered
that
the
trouble
may
all
the
time
be
essential
and
that
the
intellect
even
with
truth
directly
in
its
grasp
may
have
no
infallible
signal
for
knowing
whether
it
be
truth
or
no
when
indeed
one
remembers
that
the
most
striking
practical
application
to
life
of
the
doctrine
of
objective
certitude
has
been
the
conscientious
labors
of
the
holy
office
of
the
inquisition
one
feels
less
tempted
than
ever
to
lend
the
doctrine
a
respectful
ear
but
please
observe
now
that
when
as
empiricists
we
give
up
the
doctrine
of
objective
certitude
we
do
not
thereby
give
up
the
quest
or
hope
of
truth
itself
we
still
pin
our
faith
on
its
existence
and
still
believe
that
we
gain
an
ever
better
position
towards
it
by
systematically
continuing
to
roll
up
experiences
and
think
our
great
difference
from
the
scholastic
lies
in
the
way
we
face
the
strength
of
his
system
lies
in
the
principles
the
origin
the
a
of
his
thought
for
us
the
strength
is
in
the
outcome
the
upshot
the
ad
not
where
it
comes
from
but
what
it
leads
to
is
to
decide
it
matters
not
to
an
empiricist
from
what
quarter
an
hypothesis
may
come
to
him
he
may
have
acquired
it
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
passion
may
have
whispered
or
accident
suggested
it
but
if
the
total
drift
of
thinking
continues
to
confirm
it
that
is
what
he
means
by
its
being
true
vii
one
more
point
small
but
important
and
our
preliminaries
are
done
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
our
duty
in
the
matter
of
opinion
ways
entirely
different
and
yet
ways
about
whose
difference
the
theory
of
knowledge
seems
hitherto
to
have
shown
very
little
concern
must
know
the
and
must
avoid
these
are
our
first
and
great
commandments
as
knowers
but
they
are
not
two
ways
of
stating
an
identical
commandment
they
are
two
separable
laws
although
it
may
indeed
happen
that
when
we
believe
the
truth
we
escape
as
an
incidental
consequence
from
believing
the
falsehood
it
hardly
ever
happens
that
by
merely
disbelieving
we
necessarily
believe
we
may
in
escaping
fall
into
believing
other
falsehoods
or
just
as
bad
as
or
we
may
escape
by
not
believing
anything
at
all
not
even
believe
truth
shun
error
these
we
see
are
two
materially
different
laws
and
by
choosing
between
them
we
may
end
by
coloring
differently
our
whole
intellectual
life
we
may
regard
the
chase
for
truth
as
paramount
and
the
avoidance
of
error
as
secondary
or
we
may
on
the
other
hand
treat
the
avoidance
of
error
as
more
imperative
and
let
truth
take
its
chance
clifford
in
the
instructive
passage
which
i
have
quoted
exhorts
us
to
the
latter
course
believe
nothing
he
tells
us
keep
your
mind
in
suspense
forever
rather
than
by
closing
it
on
insufficient
evidence
incur
the
awful
risk
of
believing
lies
you
on
the
other
hand
may
think
that
the
risk
of
being
in
error
is
a
very
small
matter
when
compared
with
the
blessings
of
real
knowledge
and
be
ready
to
be
duped
many
times
in
your
investigation
rather
than
postpone
indefinitely
the
chance
of
guessing
true
i
myself
find
it
impossible
to
go
with
clifford
we
must
remember
that
these
feelings
of
our
duty
about
either
truth
or
error
are
in
any
case
only
expressions
of
our
passional
life
biologically
considered
our
minds
are
as
ready
to
grind
out
falsehood
as
veracity
and
he
who
says
better
go
without
belief
forever
than
believe
a
lie
merely
shows
his
own
preponderant
private
horror
of
becoming
a
dupe
he
may
be
critical
of
many
of
his
desires
and
fears
but
this
fear
he
slavishly
obeys
he
can
not
imagine
any
one
questioning
its
binding
force
for
my
own
part
i
have
also
a
horror
of
being
duped
but
i
can
believe
that
worse
things
than
being
duped
may
happen
to
a
man
in
this
world
so
exhortation
has
to
my
ears
a
thoroughly
fantastic
sound
it
is
like
a
general
informing
his
soldiers
that
it
is
better
to
keep
out
of
battle
forever
than
to
risk
a
single
wound
not
so
are
victories
either
over
enemies
or
over
nature
gained
our
errors
are
surely
not
such
awfully
solemn
things
in
a
world
where
we
are
so
certain
to
incur
them
in
spite
of
all
our
caution
a
certain
lightness
of
heart
seems
healthier
than
this
excessive
nervousness
on
their
behalf
at
any
rate
it
seems
the
fittest
thing
for
the
empiricist
philosopher
viii
and
now
after
all
this
introduction
let
us
go
straight
at
our
question
i
have
said
and
now
repeat
it
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
we
find
our
passional
nature
influencing
us
in
our
opinions
but
that
there
are
some
options
between
opinions
in
which
this
influence
must
be
regarded
both
as
an
inevitable
and
as
a
lawful
determinant
of
our
choice
i
fear
here
that
some
of
you
my
hearers
will
begin
to
scent
danger
and
lend
an
inhospitable
ear
two
first
steps
of
passion
you
have
indeed
had
to
admit
as
necessary
we
must
think
so
as
to
avoid
dupery
and
we
must
think
so
as
to
gain
truth
but
the
surest
path
to
those
ideal
consummations
you
will
probably
consider
is
from
now
onwards
to
take
no
further
passional
step
well
of
course
i
agree
as
far
as
the
facts
will
allow
wherever
the
option
between
losing
truth
and
gaining
it
is
not
momentous
we
can
throw
the
chance
of
away
and
at
any
rate
save
ourselves
from
any
chance
of
by
not
making
up
our
minds
at
all
till
objective
evidence
has
come
in
scientific
questions
this
is
almost
always
the
case
and
even
in
human
affairs
in
general
the
need
of
acting
is
seldom
so
urgent
that
a
false
belief
to
act
on
is
better
than
no
belief
at
all
law
courts
indeed
have
to
decide
on
the
best
evidence
attainable
for
the
moment
because
a
judge
duty
is
to
make
law
as
well
as
to
ascertain
it
and
as
a
learned
judge
once
said
to
me
few
cases
are
worth
spending
much
time
over
the
great
thing
is
to
have
them
decided
on
acceptable
principle
and
got
out
of
the
way
but
in
our
dealings
with
objective
nature
we
obviously
are
recorders
not
makers
of
the
truth
and
decisions
for
the
mere
sake
of
deciding
promptly
and
getting
on
to
the
next
business
would
be
wholly
out
of
place
throughout
the
breadth
of
physical
nature
facts
are
what
they
are
quite
independently
of
us
and
seldom
is
there
any
such
hurry
about
them
that
the
risks
of
being
duped
by
believing
a
premature
theory
need
be
faced
the
questions
here
are
always
trivial
options
the
hypotheses
are
hardly
living
at
any
rate
not
living
for
us
spectators
the
choice
between
believing
truth
or
falsehood
is
seldom
forced
the
attitude
of
sceptical
balance
is
therefore
the
absolutely
wise
one
if
we
would
escape
mistakes
what
difference
indeed
does
it
make
to
most
of
us
whether
we
have
or
have
not
a
theory
of
the
r√∂ntgen
rays
whether
we
believe
or
not
in
or
have
a
conviction
about
the
causality
of
conscious
states
it
makes
no
difference
such
options
are
not
forced
on
us
on
every
account
it
is
better
not
to
make
them
but
still
keep
weighing
reasons
et
with
an
indifferent
hand
i
speak
of
course
here
of
the
purely
judging
mind
for
purposes
of
discovery
such
indifference
is
to
be
less
highly
recommended
and
science
would
be
far
less
advanced
than
she
is
if
the
passionate
desires
of
individuals
to
get
their
own
faiths
confirmed
had
been
kept
out
of
the
game
see
for
example
the
sagacity
which
spencer
and
weismann
now
display
on
the
other
hand
if
you
want
an
absolute
duffer
in
an
investigation
you
must
after
all
take
the
man
who
has
no
interest
whatever
in
its
results
he
is
the
warranted
incapable
the
positive
fool
the
most
useful
investigator
because
the
most
sensitive
observer
is
always
he
whose
eager
interest
in
one
side
of
the
question
is
balanced
by
an
equally
keen
nervousness
lest
he
become
deceived
science
has
organized
this
nervousness
into
a
regular
her
method
of
verification
and
she
has
fallen
so
deeply
in
love
with
the
method
that
one
may
even
say
she
has
ceased
to
care
for
truth
by
itself
at
all
it
is
only
truth
as
technically
verified
that
interests
her
the
truth
of
truths
might
come
in
merely
affirmative
form
and
she
would
decline
to
touch
it
such
truth
as
that
she
might
repeat
with
clifford
would
be
stolen
in
defiance
of
her
duty
to
mankind
human
passions
however
are
stronger
than
technical
rules
le
coeur
a
ses
raisons
as
pascal
says
que
la
raison
ne
conna√Æt
pas
and
however
indifferent
to
all
but
the
bare
rules
of
the
game
the
umpire
the
abstract
intellect
may
be
the
concrete
players
who
furnish
him
the
materials
to
judge
of
are
usually
each
one
of
them
in
love
with
some
pet
hypothesis
of
his
own
let
us
agree
however
that
wherever
there
is
no
forced
option
the
dispassionately
judicial
intellect
with
no
pet
hypothesis
saving
us
as
it
does
from
dupery
at
any
rate
ought
to
be
our
ideal
the
question
next
arises
are
there
not
somewhere
forced
options
in
our
speculative
questions
and
can
we
as
men
who
may
be
interested
at
least
as
much
in
positively
gaining
truth
as
in
merely
escaping
dupery
always
wait
with
impunity
till
the
coercive
evidence
shall
have
arrived
it
seems
improbable
that
the
truth
should
be
so
nicely
adjusted
to
our
needs
and
powers
as
that
in
the
great
of
nature
the
cakes
and
the
butter
and
the
syrup
seldom
come
out
so
even
and
leave
the
plates
so
clean
indeed
we
should
view
them
with
scientific
suspicion
if
they
did
ix
immediately
present
themselves
as
questions
whose
solution
can
not
wait
for
sensible
proof
a
moral
question
is
a
question
not
of
what
sensibly
exists
but
of
what
is
good
or
would
be
good
if
it
did
exist
science
can
tell
us
what
exists
but
to
compare
the
both
of
what
exists
and
of
what
does
not
exist
we
must
consult
not
science
but
what
pascal
calls
our
heart
science
herself
consults
her
heart
when
she
lays
it
down
that
the
infinite
ascertainment
of
fact
and
correction
of
false
belief
are
the
supreme
goods
for
man
challenge
the
statement
and
science
can
only
repeat
it
oracularly
or
else
prove
it
by
showing
that
such
ascertainment
and
correction
bring
man
all
sorts
of
other
goods
which
man
heart
in
turn
declares
the
question
of
having
moral
beliefs
at
all
or
not
having
them
is
decided
by
our
will
are
our
moral
preferences
true
or
false
or
are
they
only
odd
biological
phenomena
making
things
good
or
bad
for
but
in
themselves
indifferent
how
can
your
pure
intellect
decide
if
your
heart
does
not
a
world
of
moral
reality
your
head
will
assuredly
never
make
you
believe
in
one
mephistophelian
scepticism
indeed
will
satisfy
the
much
better
than
any
rigorous
idealism
can
some
men
even
at
the
student
age
are
so
naturally
that
the
moralistic
hypothesis
never
has
for
them
any
pungent
life
and
in
their
supercilious
presence
the
hot
young
moralist
always
feels
strangely
ill
at
ease
the
appearance
of
knowingness
is
on
their
side
of
na√Øvet√©
and
gullibility
on
his
yet
in
the
inarticulate
heart
of
him
he
clings
to
it
that
he
is
not
a
dupe
and
that
there
is
a
realm
in
which
as
emerson
says
all
their
wit
and
intellectual
superiority
is
no
better
than
the
cunning
of
a
fox
moral
scepticism
can
no
more
be
refuted
or
proved
by
logic
than
intellectual
scepticism
can
when
we
stick
to
it
that
there
truth
be
it
of
either
kind
we
do
so
with
our
whole
nature
and
resolve
to
stand
or
fall
by
the
results
the
sceptic
with
his
whole
nature
adopts
the
doubting
attitude
but
which
of
us
is
the
wiser
omniscience
only
knows
turn
now
from
these
wide
questions
of
good
to
a
certain
class
of
questions
of
fact
questions
concerning
personal
relations
states
of
mind
between
one
man
and
another
you
like
me
or
not
for
example
whether
you
do
or
not
depends
in
countless
instances
on
whether
i
meet
you
am
willing
to
assume
that
you
must
like
me
and
show
you
trust
and
expectation
the
previous
faith
on
my
part
in
your
liking
existence
is
in
such
cases
what
makes
your
liking
come
but
if
i
stand
aloof
and
refuse
to
budge
an
inch
until
i
have
objective
evidence
until
you
shall
have
done
something
apt
as
the
absolutists
say
extorquendum
assensum
ten
to
one
your
liking
never
comes
how
many
women
hearts
are
vanquished
by
the
mere
sanguine
insistence
of
some
man
that
they
love
him
he
will
not
consent
to
the
hypothesis
that
they
can
not
the
desire
for
a
certain
kind
of
truth
here
brings
about
that
special
truth
existence
and
so
it
is
in
innumerable
cases
of
other
sorts
who
gains
promotions
boons
appointments
but
the
man
in
whose
life
they
are
seen
to
play
the
part
of
live
hypotheses
who
discounts
them
sacrifices
other
things
for
their
sake
before
they
have
come
and
takes
risks
for
them
in
advance
his
faith
acts
on
the
powers
above
him
as
a
claim
and
creates
its
own
verification
a
social
organism
of
any
sort
whatever
large
or
small
is
what
it
is
because
each
member
proceeds
to
his
own
duty
with
a
trust
that
the
other
members
will
simultaneously
do
theirs
wherever
a
desired
result
is
achieved
by
the
of
many
independent
persons
its
existence
as
a
fact
is
a
pure
consequence
of
the
precursive
faith
in
one
another
of
those
immediately
concerned
a
government
an
army
a
commercial
system
a
ship
a
college
an
athletic
team
all
exist
on
this
condition
without
which
not
only
is
nothing
achieved
but
nothing
is
even
attempted
a
whole
train
of
passengers
individually
brave
enough
will
be
looted
by
a
few
highwaymen
simply
because
the
latter
can
count
on
one
another
while
each
passenger
fears
that
if
he
makes
a
movement
of
resistance
he
will
be
shot
before
any
one
else
backs
him
up
if
we
believed
that
the
whole
would
rise
at
once
with
us
we
should
each
severally
rise
and
would
never
even
be
attempted
there
are
then
cases
where
a
fact
can
not
come
at
all
unless
a
preliminary
faith
exists
in
its
coming
where
faith
in
a
fact
can
help
create
the
that
would
be
an
insane
logic
which
should
say
that
faith
running
ahead
of
scientific
evidence
is
the
kind
of
immorality
into
which
a
thinking
being
can
fall
yet
such
is
the
logic
by
which
our
scientific
absolutists
pretend
to
regulate
our
lives
x
in
truths
dependent
on
our
personal
action
then
faith
based
on
desire
is
certainly
a
lawful
and
possibly
an
indispensable
thing
but
now
it
will
be
said
these
are
all
childish
human
cases
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
great
cosmical
matters
like
the
question
of
religious
faith
let
us
then
pass
on
to
that
religions
differ
so
much
in
their
accidents
that
in
discussing
the
religious
question
we
must
make
it
very
generic
and
broad
what
then
do
we
now
mean
by
the
religious
hypothesis
science
says
things
are
morality
says
some
things
are
better
than
other
things
and
religion
says
essentially
two
things
first
she
says
that
the
best
things
are
the
more
eternal
things
the
overlapping
things
the
things
in
the
universe
that
throw
the
last
stone
so
to
speak
and
say
the
final
word
perfection
is
eternal
this
phrase
of
charles
secr√©tan
seems
a
good
way
of
putting
this
first
affirmation
of
religion
an
affirmation
which
obviously
can
not
yet
be
verified
scientifically
at
all
the
second
affirmation
of
religion
is
that
we
are
better
off
even
now
if
we
believe
her
first
affirmation
to
be
true
now
let
us
consider
what
the
logical
elements
of
this
situation
are
case
the
religious
hypothesis
in
both
its
branches
be
really
of
course
we
must
admit
that
possibility
at
the
outset
if
we
are
to
discuss
the
question
at
all
it
must
involve
a
living
option
if
for
any
of
you
religion
be
a
hypothesis
that
can
not
by
any
living
possibility
be
true
then
you
need
go
no
farther
i
speak
to
the
remnant
alone
so
proceeding
we
see
first
that
religion
offers
itself
as
a
option
we
are
supposed
to
gain
even
now
by
our
belief
and
to
lose
by
our
a
certain
vital
good
secondly
religion
is
a
option
so
far
as
that
good
goes
we
can
not
escape
the
issue
by
remaining
sceptical
and
waiting
for
more
light
because
although
we
do
avoid
error
in
that
way
religion
be
we
lose
the
good
it
be
just
as
certainly
as
if
we
positively
chose
to
disbelieve
it
is
as
if
a
man
should
hesitate
indefinitely
to
ask
a
certain
woman
to
marry
him
because
he
was
not
perfectly
sure
that
she
would
prove
an
angel
after
he
brought
her
home
would
he
not
cut
himself
off
from
that
particular
as
decisively
as
if
he
went
and
married
some
one
else
scepticism
then
is
not
avoidance
of
option
it
is
option
of
a
certain
particular
kind
of
risk
risk
loss
of
truth
than
chance
of
that
is
your
exact
position
he
is
actively
playing
his
stake
as
much
as
the
believer
is
he
is
backing
the
field
against
the
religious
hypothesis
just
as
the
believer
is
backing
the
religious
hypothesis
against
the
field
to
preach
scepticism
to
us
as
a
duty
until
evidence
for
religion
be
found
is
tantamount
therefore
to
telling
us
when
in
presence
of
the
religious
hypothesis
that
to
yield
to
our
fear
of
its
being
error
is
wiser
and
better
than
to
yield
to
our
hope
that
it
may
be
true
it
is
not
intellect
against
all
passions
then
it
is
only
intellect
with
one
passion
laying
down
its
law
and
by
what
forsooth
is
the
supreme
wisdom
of
this
passion
warranted
dupery
for
dupery
what
proof
is
there
that
dupery
through
hope
is
so
much
worse
than
dupery
through
fear
i
for
one
can
see
no
proof
and
i
simply
refuse
obedience
to
the
scientist
command
to
imitate
his
kind
of
option
in
a
case
where
my
own
stake
is
important
enough
to
give
me
the
right
to
choose
my
own
form
of
risk
if
religion
be
true
and
the
evidence
for
it
be
still
insufficient
i
do
not
wish
by
putting
your
extinguisher
upon
my
nature
which
feels
to
me
as
if
it
had
after
all
some
business
in
this
matter
to
forfeit
my
sole
chance
in
life
of
getting
upon
the
winning
side
that
chance
depending
of
course
on
my
willingness
to
run
the
risk
of
acting
as
if
my
passional
need
of
taking
the
world
religiously
might
be
prophetic
and
right
all
this
is
on
the
supposition
that
it
really
may
be
prophetic
and
right
and
that
even
to
us
who
are
discussing
the
matter
religion
is
a
live
hypothesis
which
may
be
true
now
to
most
of
us
religion
comes
in
a
still
further
way
that
makes
a
veto
on
our
active
faith
even
more
illogical
the
more
perfect
and
more
eternal
aspect
of
the
universe
is
represented
in
our
religions
as
having
personal
form
the
universe
is
no
longer
a
mere
to
us
but
a
if
we
are
religious
and
any
relation
that
may
be
possible
from
person
to
person
might
be
possible
here
for
instance
although
in
one
sense
we
are
passive
portions
of
the
universe
in
another
we
show
a
curious
autonomy
as
if
we
were
small
active
centres
on
our
own
account
we
feel
too
as
if
the
appeal
of
religion
to
us
were
made
to
our
own
active
as
if
evidence
might
be
forever
withheld
from
us
unless
we
met
the
hypothesis
to
take
a
trivial
illustration
just
as
a
man
who
in
a
company
of
gentlemen
made
no
advances
asked
a
warrant
for
every
concession
and
believed
no
one
word
without
proof
would
cut
himself
off
by
such
churlishness
from
all
the
social
rewards
that
a
more
trusting
spirit
would
earn
so
here
one
who
should
shut
himself
up
in
snarling
logicality
and
try
to
make
the
gods
extort
his
recognition
or
not
get
it
at
all
might
cut
himself
off
forever
from
his
only
opportunity
of
making
the
gods
acquaintance
this
feeling
forced
on
us
we
know
not
whence
that
by
obstinately
believing
that
there
are
gods
although
not
to
do
so
would
be
so
easy
both
for
our
logic
and
our
life
we
are
doing
the
universe
the
deepest
service
we
can
seems
part
of
the
living
essence
of
the
religious
hypothesis
if
the
hypothesis
true
in
all
its
parts
including
this
one
then
pure
intellectualism
with
its
veto
on
our
making
willing
advances
would
be
an
absurdity
and
some
participation
of
our
sympathetic
nature
would
be
logically
required
i
therefore
for
one
can
not
see
my
way
to
accepting
the
agnostic
rules
for
or
wilfully
agree
to
keep
my
willing
nature
out
of
the
game
i
can
not
do
so
for
this
plain
reason
that
rule
of
thinking
which
would
absolutely
prevent
me
from
acknowledging
certain
kinds
of
truth
if
those
kinds
of
truth
were
really
there
would
be
an
irrational
that
for
me
is
the
long
and
short
of
the
formal
logic
of
the
situation
no
matter
what
the
kinds
of
truth
might
materially
be
i
confess
i
do
not
see
how
this
logic
can
be
escaped
but
sad
experience
makes
me
fear
that
some
of
you
may
still
shrink
from
radically
saying
with
me
that
we
have
the
right
to
believe
at
our
own
risk
any
hypothesis
that
is
live
enough
to
tempt
our
will
i
suspect
however
that
if
this
is
so
it
is
because
you
have
got
away
from
the
abstract
logical
point
of
view
altogether
and
are
thinking
perhaps
without
realizing
it
of
some
particular
religious
hypothesis
which
for
you
is
dead
the
freedom
to
what
we
will
you
apply
to
the
case
of
some
patent
superstition
and
the
faith
you
think
of
is
the
faith
defined
by
the
schoolboy
when
he
said
faith
is
when
you
believe
something
that
you
know
ai
true
i
can
only
repeat
that
this
is
misapprehension
the
freedom
to
believe
can
only
cover
living
options
which
the
intellect
of
the
individual
can
not
by
itself
resolve
and
living
options
never
seem
absurdities
to
him
who
has
them
to
consider
when
i
look
at
the
religious
question
as
it
really
puts
itself
to
concrete
men
and
when
i
think
of
all
the
possibilities
which
both
practically
and
theoretically
it
involves
then
this
command
that
we
shall
put
a
stopper
on
our
heart
instincts
and
courage
and
wait
acting
of
course
meanwhile
more
or
less
as
if
religion
were
true
till
doomsday
or
till
such
time
as
our
intellect
and
senses
working
together
may
have
raked
in
evidence
enough
this
command
i
say
seems
to
me
the
queerest
idol
ever
manufactured
in
the
philosophic
cave
were
we
scholastic
absolutists
there
might
be
more
excuse
if
we
had
an
infallible
intellect
with
its
objective
certitudes
we
might
feel
ourselves
disloyal
to
such
a
perfect
organ
of
knowledge
in
not
trusting
to
it
exclusively
in
not
waiting
for
its
releasing
word
but
if
we
are
empiricists
if
we
believe
that
no
bell
in
us
tolls
to
let
us
know
for
certain
when
truth
is
in
our
grasp
then
it
seems
a
piece
of
idle
fantasticality
to
preach
so
solemnly
our
duty
of
waiting
for
the
bell
indeed
we
wait
if
we
will
i
hope
you
do
not
think
that
i
am
denying
that
but
if
we
do
so
we
do
so
at
our
peril
as
much
as
if
we
believed
in
either
case
we
taking
our
life
in
our
hands
no
one
of
us
ought
to
issue
vetoes
to
the
other
nor
should
we
bandy
words
of
abuse
we
ought
on
the
contrary
delicately
and
profoundly
to
respect
one
another
mental
freedom
then
only
shall
we
bring
about
the
intellectual
republic
then
only
shall
we
have
that
spirit
of
inner
tolerance
without
which
all
our
outer
tolerance
is
soulless
and
which
is
empiricism
glory
then
only
shall
we
live
and
let
live
in
speculative
as
well
as
in
practical
things
i
began
by
a
reference
to
fitz
james
stephen
let
me
end
by
a
quotation
from
him
what
do
you
think
of
yourself
what
do
you
think
of
the
world
these
are
questions
with
which
all
must
deal
as
it
seems
good
to
them
they
are
riddles
of
the
sphinx
and
in
some
way
or
other
we
must
deal
with
them
in
all
important
transactions
of
life
we
have
to
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
if
we
decide
to
leave
the
riddles
unanswered
that
is
a
choice
if
we
waver
in
our
answer
that
too
is
a
choice
but
whatever
choice
we
make
we
make
it
at
our
peril
if
a
man
chooses
to
turn
his
back
altogether
on
god
and
the
future
no
one
can
prevent
him
no
one
can
show
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
he
is
mistaken
if
a
man
thinks
otherwise
and
acts
as
he
thinks
i
do
not
see
that
any
one
can
prove
that
is
mistaken
each
must
act
as
he
thinks
best
and
if
he
is
wrong
so
much
the
worse
for
him
we
stand
on
a
mountain
pass
in
the
midst
of
whirling
snow
and
blinding
mist
through
which
we
get
glimpses
now
and
then
of
paths
which
may
be
deceptive
if
we
stand
still
we
shall
be
frozen
to
death
if
we
take
the
wrong
road
we
shall
be
dashed
to
pieces
we
do
not
certainly
know
whether
there
is
any
right
one
what
must
we
do
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
act
for
the
best
hope
for
the
best
and
take
what
comes
if
death
ends
all
we
can
not
meet
death

the

be
my
theme
in
the
deepest
heart
of
all
of
us
there
is
a
corner
in
which
the
ultimate
mystery
of
things
works
sadly
and
i
know
not
what
such
an
association
as
yours
intends
nor
what
you
ask
of
those
whom
you
invite
to

you
unless
it
be
to
lead
you
from
the
of

for

you
heedless
to
the
buzzing
and
jigging
and
vibration
of
small
interests
and
excitements
that
form
the
tissue
of
our
ordinary
consciousness
without

explanation
or
apology
then
i
ask
you
to
join
me
in
turning
an
attention
commonly
too
unwilling
to
the
profounder
of
life
let
us
search
the
lonely
depths
for
an
hour
together
and
see
what
answers
in
the
last
folds
and
recesses
of
things
our
question
may
find
i
with
many
men
the
question
of
life
worth
is
answered
by
a
temperamental
optimism
which
makes
them
incapable
of
believing
that
anything
seriously
evil
can
exist
our
dear
old
walt
whitman
works
are
the
standing
of
this
kind
of
optimism
the
mere
joy
of
living
is
so
immense
in
walt
whitman
veins
that
it
abolishes
the
possibility
of
any
other
kind
of
feeling
to
breathe
the
air
how
delicious
to
speak
to
walk
to
seize
something

nine
years

spent
at
annecy
with
nothing
but
his
happiness

tell
how
tell
what
was
neither
said
nor
done
nor
even
thought
but
tasted
only
and
felt
with
no
object
of
my
felicity
but
the
emotion
of
felicity
itself
i
rose
with

and
i

i
went

and
i

happiness
followed
me
everywhere
it
was

no

assignable
thing
it
was
all
within
myself
it
could
not
leave
me
for
a
single
instant
if
moods
like
this
could
be
made
permanent
and
constitutions
like
these
universal
there
would
never
be
any
occasion
for
such
discourses
as
the
present
one
no
philosopher
would
seek
to
prove
articulately
that
life
is
worth
living
for
the
fact
that
it
absolutely
is
so
would
vouch
for
itself
and
the
problem
disappear
in
the
vanishing
of
the
question
rather
than
in
the
coming
of
anything

we
are
not
magicians
to
make
the
optimistic
temperament
universal
and
alongside
of
the
deliverances
of
temperamental
optimism
concerning
life
those
of
temperamental
pessimism
always
exist
and
oppose
to
them
a
standing
refutation
in
what
is
called
insanity
phases
of
melancholy
succeed
phases
of
mania
with
no

we
can
discover

behold
him

melancholy
and
black
delusions
of
suspicion
and
fear
some
men
seem
launched
upon
the
world
even
from
their
birth
with
souls
as
incapable
of
happiness
as
walt
whitman
was
of
gloom
and
they
have
left
us
their
messages
in
even
more
lasting
verse
than
his
the
exquisite
leopardi
for
example
or
our
own
contemporary
james
thomson
in
that
pathetic
book
the
city
of
dreadful
night
which
i
think
is
less
than
it
should
be
for
its
literary
beauty
simply
because
men
are
afraid
to
quote
its
words
they
are
so
gloomy
and
at
the
same
time
so
sincere
in
one
place
the
poet
describes
a
congregation
gathered
to
listen
to
a
preacher
in
a
great
unillumined
cathedral
at
night
the
sermon
is
too
long
to
quote
but
it
ends
thus
brothers
of
sad
lives
they
are
so
brief
a
few
short
years
must
bring
us
all
relief
can
we
not
bear
these
years
of
laboring
breath
but
if
you
would
not
this
poor
life
fulfil
lo
you
are
free
to
end
it
when
you
will
without
the
fear
of
waking
after
death
the
vibrations
of
his
voice
thrilled
through
the
vaulted
aisles
and
died
away
the
yearning
of
the
tones
which
bade
rejoice
was
sad
and
tender
as
a
requiem
lay
our
shadowy
congregation
rested
still
as
brooding
on
that
it
when
you
will
our
shadowy
congregation
rested
still
as
musing
on
that
message
we
had
heard
and
brooding
on
that
it
when
you
will
perchance
awaiting
yet
some
other
word
when
keen
as
lightning
through
a
muffled
sky
sprang
forth
a
shrill
and
lamentable

me
that

for
senseless

came
from

northern
aisle

and
shrill
to

harsh
close
and
none
gave

for
a
certain
while
for

must
shrink
from
these
most
wordless
woes
at
last
the
pulpit
speaker
simply
said
with
humid
eyes
and
thoughtful
drooping
head
brother
my
poor
brothers
it
is
thus
this
life
holds
nothing
good
for
us
but
it
ends
soon
and
nevermore
can
be
and
we
knew
nothing
of
it
ere
our
birth
and
shall
know
nothing
when
consigned
to
earth
i
ponder
these
thoughts
and
they
comfort
me
it
ends
soon
and
never
more
can
be
lo
you
are
free
to
end
it
when
you
will
these
verses
flow
truthfully
from
the
melancholy
pen
and
are
in
truth
a
consolation
for
all
to
whom
as
to
him
the
world
is
far
more
like
a
steady
den
of
fear
than
a
continual
fountain
of
delight
that
life
is
not
worth
living
the
whole
army
of
suicides
declare
an
army
whose
like
the
famous
evening
gun
of
the
british
army
follows
the
sun
round
the
world
and
never
terminates
we
too
as
we
sit
here
in
our
comfort
must
these
also
for
we
are
of
one
substance
with
these
suicides
and
their
life
is
the
life
we
share
the
plainest
intellectual
integrity
nay
more
the
simplest
manliness
and
honor
forbid
us
to
forget
their
case
if
suddenly
says
ruskin
in
the
midst
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
palate
and
lightnesses
of
heart
of
a
london
the
walls
of
the
chamber
were
parted
and
through
their
gap
the
nearest
human
beings
who
were
famishing
and
in
misery
were
borne
into
the
midst
of
the
company
feasting
and
fancy
free
if
pale
from
death
horrible
in
destitution
broken
by
despair
body
by
body
they
were
laid
upon
the
soft
carpet
one
beside
the
chair
of
every
guest
would
only
the
crumbs
of
the
dainties
be
cast
to
them
would
only
a
passing
glance
a
passing
thought
be
vouchsafed
to
them
yet
the
actual
facts
the
real
relation
of
each
dives
and
lazarus
are
not
altered
by
the
intervention
of
the
between
the
table
and
the
by
the
few
feet
of
ground
how
few
which
are
indeed
all
that
separate
the
merriment
from
the
misery
ii
to
come
immediately
to
the
heart
of
my
theme
then
what
i
propose
is
to
imagine
ourselves
reasoning
with
a
who
is
on
such
terms
with
life
that
the
only
comfort
left
him
is
to
brood
on
the
assurance
you
may
end
it
when
you
will
what
reasons
can
we
plead
that
may
render
such
a
brother
or
sister
willing
to
take
up
the
burden
again
ordinary
christians
reasoning
with
suicides
have
little
to
offer
them
beyond
the
usual
negative
thou
shalt
not
god
alone
is
master
of
life
and
death
they
say
and
it
is
a
blasphemous
act
to
anticipate
his
absolving
hand
but
can
find
nothing
richer
or
more
positive
than
this
no
reflections
to
urge
whereby
the
suicide
may
actually
see
and
in
all
sad
seriousness
feel
that
in
spite
of
adverse
appearances
even
for
him
life
is
still
worth
living
there
are
suicides
and
suicides
in
the
united
states
about
three
thousand
of
them
every
year
and
i
must
frankly
confess
that
with
perhaps
the
majority
of
these
my
suggestions
are
impotent
to
deal
where
suicide
is
the
result
of
insanity
or
sudden
frenzied
impulse
reflection
is
impotent
to
arrest
its
headway
and
cases
like
these
belong
to
the
ultimate
mystery
of
evil
concerning
which
i
can
only
offer
considerations
tending
toward
religious
patience
at
the
end
of
this
hour
my
task
let
me
say
now
is
practically
narrow
and
my
words
are
to
deal
only
with
that
metaphysical
which
is
peculiar
to
reflecting
men
most
of
you
are
devoted
for
good
or
ill
to
the
reflective
life
many
of
you
are
students
of
philosophy
and
have
already
felt
in
your
own
persons
the
scepticism
and
unreality
that
too
much
grubbing
in
the
abstract
roots
of
things
will
breed
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
regular
fruits
of
the
career
too
much
questioning
and
too
little
active
responsibility
lead
almost
as
often
as
too
much
sensualism
does
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
at
the
bottom
of
which
lie
pessimism
and
the
nightmare
or
suicidal
view
of
life
but
to
the
diseases
which
reflection
breeds
still
further
reflection
can
oppose
effective
remedies
and
it
is
of
the
melancholy
and
bred
of
reflection
that
i
now
proceed
to
speak
let
me
say
immediately
that
my
final
appeal
is
to
nothing
more
recondite
than
religious
faith
so
far
as
my
argument
is
to
be
destructive
it
will
consist
in
nothing
more
than
the
sweeping
away
of
certain
views
that
often
keep
the
springs
of
religious
faith
compressed
and
so
far
as
it
is
to
be
constructive
it
will
consist
in
holding
up
to
the
light
of
day
certain
considerations
calculated
to
let
loose
these
springs
in
a
normal
natural
way
pessimism
is
essentially
a
religious
disease
in
the
form
of
it
to
which
you
are
most
liable
it
consists
in
nothing
but
a
religious
demand
to
which
there
comes
no
normal
religious
reply
now
there
are
two
stages
of
recovery
from
this
disease
two
different
levels
upon
which
one
may
emerge
from
the
midnight
view
to
the
daylight
view
of
things
and
i
must
treat
of
them
in
turn
the
second
stage
is
the
more
complete
and
joyous
and
it
corresponds
to
the
freer
exercise
of
religious
trust
and
fancy
there
are
as
is
well
known
persons
who
are
naturally
very
free
in
this
regard
others
who
are
not
at
all
so
there
are
persons
for
instance
whom
we
find
indulging
to
their
heart
content
in
prospects
of
immortality
and
there
are
others
who
experience
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
such
a
notion
seem
real
to
themselves
at
all
these
latter
persons
are
tied
to
their
senses
restricted
to
their
natural
experience
and
many
of
them
moreover
feel
a
sort
of
intellectual
loyalty
to
what
they
call
facts
which
is
positively
shocked
by
the
easy
excursions
into
the
unseen
that
other
people
make
at
the
bare
call
of
sentiment
minds
of
either
class
may
however
be
intensely
religious
they
may
equally
desire
atonement
and
reconciliation
and
crave
acquiescence
and
communion
with
the
total
soul
of
things
but
the
craving
when
the
mind
is
pent
in
to
the
hard
facts
especially
as
science
now
reveals
them
can
breed
pessimism
quite
as
easily
as
it
breeds
optimism
when
it
inspires
religious
trust
and
fancy
to
wing
their
way
to
another
and
a
better
world
that
is
why
i
call
pessimism
an
essentially
religious
disease
the
nightmare
view
of
life
has
plenty
of
organic
sources
but
its
great
reflective
source
has
at
all
times
been
the
contradiction
between
the
phenomena
of
nature
and
the
craving
of
the
heart
to
believe
that
behind
nature
there
is
a
spirit
whose
expression
nature
is
what
philosophers
call
theology
has
been
one
way
of
appeasing
this
craving
that
poetry
of
nature
in
which
our
english
literature
is
so
rich
has
been
another
way
now
suppose
a
mind
of
the
latter
of
our
two
classes
whose
imagination
is
pent
in
consequently
and
who
takes
its
facts
suppose
it
moreover
to
feel
strongly
the
craving
for
communion
and
yet
to
realize
how
desperately
difficult
it
is
to
construe
the
scientific
order
of
nature
either
theologically
or
poetically
and
what
result
can
there
be
but
inner
discord
and
contradiction
now
this
inner
discord
merely
as
discord
can
be
relieved
in
either
of
two
ways
the
longing
to
read
the
facts
religiously
may
cease
and
leave
the
bare
facts
by
themselves
or
supplementary
facts
may
be
discovered
or
which
permit
the
religious
reading
to
go
on
these
two
ways
of
relief
are
the
two
stages
of
recovery
the
two
levels
of
escape
from
pessimism
to
which
i
made
allusion
a
moment
ago
and
which
the
sequel
will
i
trust
make
more
clear
iii
starting
then
with
nature
we
naturally
tend
if
we
have
the
religious
craving
to
say
with
marcus
aurelius
o
universe
what
thou
wishest
i
wish
our
sacred
books
and
traditions
tell
us
of
one
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
and
looking
on
them
saw
that
they
were
good
yet
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
the
visible
surfaces
of
heaven
and
earth
refuse
to
be
brought
by
us
into
any
intelligible
unity
at
all
every
phenomenon
that
we
would
praise
there
exists
cheek
by
jowl
with
some
contrary
phenomenon
that
cancels
all
its
religious
effect
upon
the
mind
beauty
and
hideousness
love
and
cruelty
life
and
death
keep
house
together
in
indissoluble
partnership
and
there
gradually
steals
over
us
instead
of
the
old
warm
notion
of
a
deity
that
of
an
awful
power
that
neither
hates
nor
loves
but
rolls
all
things
together
meaninglessly
to
a
common
doom
this
is
an
uncanny
a
sinister
a
nightmare
view
of
life
and
its
peculiar
or
poisonousness
lies
expressly
in
our
holding
two
things
together
which
can
not
possibly
agree
in
our
clinging
on
the
one
hand
to
the
demand
that
there
shall
be
a
living
spirit
of
the
whole
and
on
the
other
to
the
belief
that
the
course
of
nature
must
be
such
a
adequate
manifestation
and
expression
it
is
in
the
contradiction
between
the
supposed
being
of
a
spirit
that
encompasses
and
owns
us
and
with
which
we
ought
to
have
some
communion
and
the
character
of
such
a
spirit
as
revealed
by
the
visible
world
course
that
this
particular
paradox
and
this
puzzle
reside
carlyle
expresses
the
result
in
that
chapter
of
his
immortal
resartus
entitled
everlasting
no
i
lived
writes
poor
teufelsdr√∂ckh
in
a
continual
indefinite
pining
fear
tremulous
pusillanimous
apprehensive
of
i
knew
not
what
it
seemed
as
if
all
things
in
the
heavens
above
and
the
earth
beneath
would
hurt
me
as
if
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
but
boundless
jaws
of
a
devouring
monster
wherein
i
palpitating
lay
waiting
to
be
devoured
this
is
the
first
stage
of
speculative
melancholy
no
brute
can
have
this
sort
of
melancholy
no
man
who
is
irreligious
can
become
its
prey
it
is
the
sick
shudder
of
the
frustrated
religious
demand
and
not
the
mere
necessary
outcome
of
animal
experience
teufelsdr√∂ckh
himself
could
have
made
shift
to
face
the
general
chaos
and
bedevilment
of
this
world
experiences
very
well
were
he
not
the
victim
of
an
originally
unlimited
trust
and
affection
towards
them
if
he
might
meet
them
piecemeal
with
no
suspicion
of
any
whole
expressing
itself
in
them
shunning
the
bitter
parts
and
husbanding
the
sweet
ones
as
the
occasion
served
and
as
the
day
was
foul
or
fair
he
could
have
zigzagged
toward
an
easy
end
and
felt
no
obligation
to
make
the
air
vocal
with
his
lamentations
the
mood
of
levity
of
do
care
is
for
this
world
ills
a
sovereign
and
practical
anaesthetic
but
no
something
deep
down
in
teufelsdr√∂ckh
and
in
the
rest
of
us
tells
us
that
there
a
spirit
in
things
to
which
we
owe
allegiance
and
for
whose
sake
we
must
keep
up
the
serious
mood
and
so
the
inner
fever
and
discord
also
are
kept
up
for
nature
taken
on
her
visible
surface
reveals
no
such
spirit
and
beyond
the
facts
of
nature
we
are
at
the
present
stage
of
our
inquiry
not
supposing
ourselves
to
look
now
i
do
not
hesitate
frankly
and
sincerely
to
confess
to
you
that
this
real
and
genuine
discord
seems
to
me
to
carry
with
it
the
inevitable
bankruptcy
of
natural
religion
na√Øvely
and
simply
taken
there
were
times
when
leibnitzes
with
their
heads
buried
in
monstrous
wigs
could
compose
theodicies
and
when
officials
of
an
established
church
could
prove
by
the
valves
in
the
heart
and
the
round
ligament
of
the
the
existence
of
a
moral
and
intelligent
contriver
of
the
world
but
those
times
are
past
and
we
of
the
nineteenth
century
with
our
evolutionary
theories
and
our
mechanical
philosophies
already
know
nature
too
impartially
and
too
well
to
worship
unreservedly
any
god
of
whose
character
she
can
be
an
adequate
expression
truly
all
we
know
of
good
and
duty
proceeds
from
nature
but
none
the
less
so
all
we
know
of
evil
visible
nature
is
all
plasticity
and
indifference
a
moral
multiverse
as
one
might
call
it
and
not
a
moral
universe
to
such
a
harlot
we
owe
no
allegiance
with
her
as
a
whole
we
can
establish
no
moral
communion
and
we
are
free
in
our
dealings
with
her
several
parts
to
obey
or
destroy
and
to
follow
no
law
but
that
of
prudence
in
coming
to
terms
with
such
other
particular
features
as
will
help
us
to
our
private
ends
if
there
be
a
divine
spirit
of
the
universe
nature
such
as
we
know
her
can
not
possibly
be
its
to
man
either
there
is
no
spirit
revealed
in
nature
or
else
it
is
inadequately
revealed
there
and
as
all
the
higher
religions
have
assumed
what
we
call
visible
nature
or
world
must
be
but
a
veil
and
whose
full
meaning
resides
in
a
supplementary
unseen
or
world
i
can
not
help
therefore
accounting
it
on
the
whole
a
gain
though
it
may
seem
for
certain
poetic
constitutions
a
very
sad
loss
that
the
naturalistic
superstition
the
worship
of
the
god
of
nature
simply
taken
as
such
should
have
begun
to
loosen
its
hold
upon
the
educated
mind
in
fact
if
i
am
to
express
my
personal
opinion
unreservedly
i
should
say
in
spite
of
its
sounding
blasphemous
at
first
to
certain
ears
that
the
initial
step
towards
getting
into
healthy
ultimate
relations
with
the
universe
is
the
act
of
rebellion
against
the
idea
that
such
a
god
exists
such
rebellion
essentially
is
that
which
in
the
chapter
i
have
quoted
from
carlyle
goes
on
to
describe
like
a
coward
dost
thou
forever
pip
and
whimper
and
go
cowering
and
trembling
despicable
biped
hast
thou
not
a
heart
canst
thou
not
suffer
whatsoever
it
be
and
as
a
child
of
freedom
though
outcast
trample
tophet
itself
under
thy
feet
while
it
consumes
thee
let
it
come
then
i
will
meet
it
and
defy
it
and
as
i
so
thought
there
rushed
like
a
stream
of
fire
over
my
whole
soul
and
i
shook
base
fear
away
from
me
forever
thus
had
the
everlasting
no
pealed
authoritatively
through
all
the
recesses
of
my
being
of
my
me
and
then
was
it
that
my
whole
me
stood
up
in
native
majesty
and
recorded
its
protest
such
a
protest
the
most
important
transaction
in
life
may
that
same
indignation
and
defiance
in
a
psychological
point
of
view
be
fitly
called
the
everlasting
no
had
said
thou
art
fatherless
outcast
and
the
universe
is
mine
to
which
my
whole
me
now
made
answer
am
not
thine
but
free
and
forever
hate
thee
from
that
hour
adds
i
began
to
be
a
man
and
our
poor
friend
james
thomson
similarly
writes
who
is
most
wretched
in
this
dolorous
place
i
think
myself
yet
i
would
rather
be
my
miserable
self
than
he
than
he
who
formed
such
creatures
to
his
own
disgrace
the
vilest
thing
must
be
less
vile
than
thou
from
whom
it
had
its
being
god
and
lord
creator
of
all
woe
and
sin
abhorred
malignant
and
implacable
i
vow
that
not
for
all
thy
power
furled
and
unfurled
for
all
the
temples
to
thy
glory
built
would
i
assume
the
ignominious
guilt
of
having
made
such
men
in
such
a
world
we
are
familiar
enough
in
this
community
with
the
spectacle
of
persons
exulting
in
their
emancipation
from
belief
in
the
god
of
their
ancestral
calvinism
him
who
made
the
garden
and
the
serpent
and
the
eternal
fires
of
hell
some
of
them
have
found
humaner
gods
to
worship
others
are
simply
converts
from
all
theology
but
both
alike
they
assure
us
that
to
have
got
rid
of
the
sophistication
of
thinking
they
could
feel
any
reverence
or
duty
toward
that
impossible
idol
gave
a
tremendous
happiness
to
their
souls
now
to
make
an
idol
of
the
spirit
of
nature
and
worship
it
also
leads
to
sophistication
and
in
souls
that
are
religious
and
would
also
be
scientific
the
sophistication
breeds
a
philosophical
melancholy
from
which
the
first
natural
step
of
escape
is
the
denial
of
the
idol
and
with
the
downfall
of
the
idol
whatever
lack
of
positive
joyousness
may
remain
there
comes
also
the
downfall
of
the
whimpering
and
cowering
mood
with
evil
simply
taken
as
such
men
can
make
short
work
for
their
relations
with
it
then
are
only
practical
it
looms
up
no
longer
so
spectrally
it
loses
all
its
haunting
and
perplexing
significance
as
soon
as
the
mind
attacks
the
instances
of
it
singly
and
ceases
to
worry
about
their
derivation
from
the
and
only
power
here
then
on
this
stage
of
mere
emancipation
from
monistic
superstition
the
suicide
may
already
get
encouraging
answers
to
his
question
about
the
worth
of
life
there
are
in
most
men
instinctive
springs
of
vitality
that
respond
healthily
when
the
burden
of
metaphysical
and
infinite
responsibility
rolls
off
the
certainty
that
you
now
step
out
of
life
whenever
you
please
and
that
to
do
so
is
not
blasphemous
or
monstrous
is
itself
an
immense
relief
the
thought
of
suicide
is
now
no
longer
a
guilty
challenge
and
obsession
this
little
life
is
all
we
must
endure
the
grave
most
holy
peace
is
ever
sure
says
thomson
adding
i
ponder
these
thoughts
and
they
comfort
me
meanwhile
we
can
always
stand
it
for
hours
longer
if
only
to
see
what
newspaper
will
contain
or
what
the
next
postman
will
bring
but
far
deeper
forces
than
this
mere
vital
curiosity
are
arousable
even
in
the
mind
for
where
the
loving
and
admiring
impulses
are
dead
the
hating
and
fighting
impulses
will
still
respond
to
fit
appeals
this
evil
which
we
feel
so
deeply
is
something
that
we
can
also
help
to
overthrow
for
its
sources
now
that
no
or
is
behind
them
are
finite
and
we
can
deal
with
each
of
them
in
turn
it
is
indeed
a
remarkable
fact
that
sufferings
and
hardships
do
not
as
a
rule
abate
the
love
of
life
they
seem
on
the
contrary
usually
to
give
it
a
keener
zest
the
sovereign
source
of
melancholy
is
repletion
need
and
struggle
are
what
excite
and
inspire
us
our
hour
of
triumph
is
what
brings
the
void
not
the
jews
of
the
captivity
but
those
of
the
days
of
solomon
glory
are
those
from
whom
the
pessimistic
utterances
in
our
bible
come

when
she
lay
trampled
beneath

hoofs
of

perhaps
the
most
optimistic
and
idealistic
literature
that
the
world
has
seen
and
not
till
the
french
were
distributed
after
did
pessimism
overrun
the
country
in
the
shape
in
which
we
see
it
there
the
history
of
our
own
race
is
one
long
commentary
on
the
cheerfulness
that
comes
with
fighting
ills
or
take
the
waldenses
of
whom
i
lately
have
been
reading
as
examples
of
what
strong
men
will
endure

does

powers

politicians

and
the

life
is
worth
living
no
matter
what
it
bring
if
only
such
combats
may
be
carried
to
successful
terminations
and
one
heel
set
on
the
tyrant
throat
to
the
suicide
then
in
his
supposed
world
of
multifarious
and
immoral
nature
you
can
appeal
and
appeal
in
the
name
of
the
very
evils
that
make
his
heart
sick
there
to
wait
and
see
his
part
of
the
battle
out
and
the
consent
to
live
on
which
you
ask
of
him
under
these
circumstances
is
not
the
sophistical
which
devotees
of
cowering
religions
preach
it
is
not
resignation
in
the
sense
of
licking
a
despotic
deity
hand
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
resignation
based
on
manliness
and
pride
so
long
as
your
suicide
leaves
an
evil
of
his
own
unremedied
so
long
he
has
strictly
no
concern
with
evil
in
the
abstract
and
at
large
the
submission
which
you
demand
of
yourself
to
the
general
fact
of
evil
in
the
world
your
apparent
acquiescence
in
it
is
here
nothing
but
the
conviction
that
evil
at
large
is
of
your
until
your
business
with
your
private
particular
evils
is
liquidated
and
settled
up
a
challenge
of
this
sort
with
proper
designation
of
detail
is
one
that
need
only
be
made
to
be
accepted
by
men
whose
normal
instincts
are
not
decayed
and
your
reflective
suicide
may
easily
be
moved
by
it
to
face
life
with
a
certain
interest
again
the
sentiment
of
honor
is
a
very
penetrating
thing
when
you
and
i
for
instance
realize
how
many
innocent
beasts
have
had
to
suffer
in
and
and
lay
down
their
lives
that
we
might
grow
up
all
fattened
and
clad
to
sit
together
here
in
comfort
and
carry
on
this
discourse
it
does
indeed
put
our
relation
to
the
universe
in
a
more
solemn
light
does
not
as
a
young
amherst
philosopher
xenos
clark
now
dead
once
wrote
the
acceptance
of
a
happy
life
upon
such
terms
involve
a
point
of
honor
are
we
not
bound
to
take
some
suffering
upon
ourselves
to
do
some
service
with
our
lives
in
return
for
all
those
lives
upon
which
ours
are
built
to
hear
this
question
is
to
answer
it
in
but
one
possible
way
if
one
have
a
normally
constituted
heart
thus
then
we
see
that
mere
instinctive
curiosity
pugnacity
and
honor
may
make
life
on
a
purely
naturalistic
basis
seem
worth
living
from
day
to
day
to
men
who
have
cast
away
all
metaphysics
in
order
to
get
rid
of
hypochondria
but
who
are
resolved
to
owe
nothing
as
yet
to
religion
and
its
more
positive
gifts
a
poor
stage
some
of
you
may
be
inclined
to
say
but
at
least
you
must
grant
it
to
be
an
honest
stage
and
no
man
should
dare
to
speak
meanly
of
these
instincts
which
are
our
nature
best
equipment
and
to
which
religion
herself
must
in
the
last
resort
address
her
own
peculiar
appeals
iv
and
now
in
turning
to
what
religion
may
have
to
say
to
the
question
i
come
to
what
is
the
soul
of
my
discourse
religion
has
meant
many
things
in
human
history
but
when
from
now
onward
i
use
the
word
i
mean
to
use
it
in
the
supernaturalist
sense
as
declaring
that
the
order
of
nature
which
constitutes
this
world
experience
is
only
one
portion
of
the
total
universe
and
that
there
stretches
beyond
this
visible
world
an
unseen
world
of
which
we
now
know
nothing
positive
but
in
its
relation
to
which
the
true
significance
of
our
present
mundane
life
consists
a
man
religious
faith
whatever
more
special
items
of
doctrine
it
may
involve
means
for
me
essentially
his
faith
in
the
existence
of
an
unseen
order
of
some
kind
in
which
the
riddles
of
the
natural
order
may
be
found
explained
in
the
more
developed
religions
the
natural
world
has
always
been
regarded
as
the
mere
scaffolding
or
vestibule
of
a
truer
more
eternal
world
and
affirmed
to
be
a
sphere
of
education
trial
or
redemption
in
these
religions
one
must
in
some
fashion
die
to
the
natural
life
before
one
can
enter
into
life
eternal
the
notion
that
this
physical
world
of
wind
and
water
where
the
sun
rises
and
the
moon
sets
is
absolutely
and
ultimately
the
divinely
and
established
thing
is
one
which
we
find
only
in
very
early
religions
such
as
that
of
the
most
primitive
jews
it
is
this
natural
religion
primitive
still
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
poets
and
men
of
science
whose
exceeds
their
perspicacity
keep
publishing
it
in
new
editions
tuned
to
our
contemporary
ears
that
as
i
said
a
while
ago
has
suffered
definitive
bankruptcy
in
the
opinion
of
a
circle
of
persons
among
whom
i
must
count
myself
and
who
are
growing
more
numerous
every
day
for
such
persons
the
physical
order
of
nature
taken
simply
as
science
knows
it
can
not
be
held
to
reveal
any
one
harmonious
spiritual
intent
it
is
mere
as
chauncey
wright
called
it
doing
and
undoing
without
end
now
i
wish
to
make
you
feel
if
i
can
in
the
short
remainder
of
this
hour
that
we
have
a
right
to
believe
the
physical
order
to
be
only
a
partial
order
that
we
have
a
right
to
supplement
it
by
an
unseen
spiritual
order
which
we
assume
on
trust
if
only
thereby
life
may
seem
to
us
better
worth
living
again
but
as
such
a
trust
will
seem
to
some
of
you
sadly
mystical
and
execrably
unscientific
i
must
first
say
a
word
or
two
to
weaken
the
veto
which
you
may
consider
that
science
opposes
to
our
act
there
is
included
in
human
nature
an
ingrained
naturalism
and
materialism
of
mind
which
can
only
admit
facts
that
are
actually
tangible
of
this
sort
of
mind
the
entity
called
is
the
idol
fondness
for
the
word
is
one
of
the
notes
by
which
you
may
know
its
votaries
and
its
short
way
of
killing
any
opinion
that
it
disbelieves
in
is
to
call
it
it
must
be
granted
that
there
is
no
slight
excuse
for
this
science
has
made
such
glorious
leaps
in
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
extended
our
knowledge
of
nature
so
enormously
both
in
general
and
in
detail
men
of
science
moreover
have
as
a
class
displayed
such
admirable
virtues
that
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
worshippers
of
science
lose
their
head
in
this
very
university
accordingly
i
have
heard
more
than
one
teacher
say
that
all
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
truth
have
already
been
found
by
science
and
that
the
future
has
only
the
details
of
the
picture
to
fill
in
but
the
slightest
reflection
on
the
real
conditions
will
suffice
to
show
how
barbaric
such
notions
are
they
show
such
a
lack
of
scientific
imagination
that
it
is
hard
to
see
how
one
who
is
actively
advancing
any
part
of
science
can
make
a
mistake
so
crude
think
how
many
absolutely
new
scientific
conceptions
have
arisen
in
our
own
generation
how
many
new
problems
have
been
formulated
that
were
never
thought
of
before
and
then
cast
an
eye
upon
the
brevity
of
science
career
it
began
with
galileo
not
three
hundred
years
ago
four
thinkers
since
galileo
each
informing
his
successor
of
what
discoveries
his
own
lifetime
had
seen
achieved
might
have
passed
the
torch
of
science
into
our
hands
as
we
sit
here
in
this
room
indeed
for
the
matter
of
that
an
audience
much
smaller
than
the
present
one
an
audience
of
some
five
or
six
score
people
if
each
person
in
it
could
speak
for
his
own
generation
would
carry
us
away
to
the
black
unknown
of
the
human
species
to
days
without
a
document
or
monument
to
tell
their
tale
is
it
credible
that
such
a
mushroom
knowledge
such
a
growth
overnight
as
this
represent
more
than
the
minutest
glimpse
of
what
the
universe
will
really
prove
to
be
when
adequately
understood
no
our
science
is
a
drop
our
ignorance
a
sea
whatever
else
be
certain
this
at
least
is
certain
that
the
world
of
our
present
natural
knowledge
enveloped
in
a
larger
world
of
sort
of
whose
residual
properties
we
at
present
can
frame
no
positive
idea
agnostic
positivism
of
course
admits
this
principle
theoretically
in
the
most
cordial
terms
but
insists
that
we
must
not
turn
it
to
any
practical
use
we
have
no
right
this
doctrine
tells
us
to
dream
dreams
or
suppose
anything
about
the
unseen
part
of
the
universe
merely
because
to
do
so
may
be
for
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
our
highest
interests
we
must
always
wait
for
sensible
evidence
for
our
beliefs
and
where
such
evidence
is
inaccessible
we
must
frame
no
hypotheses
whatever
of
course
this
is
a
safe
enough
position
if
a
thinker
had
no
stake
in
the
unknown
no
vital
needs
to
live
or
languish
according
to
what
the
unseen
world
contained
a
philosophic
neutrality
and
refusal
to
believe
either
one
way
or
the
other
would
be
his
wisest
cue
but
unfortunately
neutrality
is
not
only
inwardly
difficult
it
is
also
outwardly
unrealizable
where
our
relations
to
an
alternative
are
practical
and
vital
this
is
because
as
the
psychologists
tell
us
belief
and
doubt
are
living
attitudes
and
involve
conduct
on
our
part
our
only
way
for
example
of
doubting
or
refusing
to
believe
that
a
certain
thing
is
continuing
to
act
as
if
it
were
if
for
instance
i
refuse
to
believe
that
the
room
is
getting
cold
i
leave
the
windows
open
and
light
no
fire
just
as
if
it
still
were
warm
if
i
doubt
that
you
are
worthy
of
my
confidence
i
keep
you
uninformed
of
all
my
secrets
just
as
if
you
were
of
the
same
if
i
doubt
the
need
of
insuring
my
house
i
leave
it
uninsured
as
much
as
if
i
believed
there
were
no
need
and
so
if
i
must
not
believe
that
the
world
is
divine
i
can
only
express
that
refusal
by
declining
ever
to
act
distinctively
as
if
it
were
so
which
can
only
mean
acting
on
certain
critical
occasions
as
if
it
were
so
or
in
an
irreligious
way
there
are
you
see
inevitable
occasions
in
life
when
inaction
is
a
kind
of
action
and
must
count
as
action
and
when
not
to
be
for
is
to
be
practically
against
and
in
all
such
cases
strict
and
consistent
neutrality
is
an
unattainable
thing
and
after
all
is
not
this
duty
of
neutrality
where
only
our
inner
interests
would
lead
us
to
believe
the
most
ridiculous
of
commands
is
it
not
sheer
dogmatic
folly
to
say
that
our
inner
interests
can
have
no
real
connection
with
the
forces
that
the
hidden
world
may
contain
in
other
cases
divinations
based
on
inner
interests
have
proved
prophetic
enough
take
science
itself
without
an
imperious
inner
demand
on
our
part
for
ideal
logical
and
mathematical
harmonies
we
should
never
have
attained
to
proving
that
such
harmonies
be
hidden
between
all
the
chinks
and
interstices
of
the
crude
natural
world
hardly
a
law
has
been
established
in
science
hardly
a
fact
ascertained
which
was
not
first
sought
after
often
with
sweat
and
blood
to
gratify
an
inner
need
whence
such
needs
come
from
we
do
not
know
we
find
them
in
us
and
biological
psychology
so
far
only
classes
them
with
darwin
variations
but
the
inner
need
of
believing
that
this
world
of
nature
is
a
sign
of
something
more
spiritual
and
eternal
than
itself
is
just
as
strong
and
authoritative
in
those
who
feel
it
as
the
inner
need
of
uniform
laws
of
causation
ever
can
be
in
a
professionally
scientific
head
the
toil
of
many
generations
has
proved
the
latter
need
prophetic
why
not
the
former
one
be
prophetic
too
and
if
needs
of
ours
outrun
the
visible
universe
why
not
that
be
a
sign
that
an
invisible
universe
is
there
what
in
short
has
authority
to
debar
us
from
trusting
our
religious
demands
science
as
such
assuredly
has
no
authority
for
she
can
only
say
what
is
not
what
is
not
and
the
agnostic
thou
shalt
not
believe
without
coercive
sensible
evidence
is
simply
an
expression
free
to
any
one
to
make
of
private
personal
appetite
for
evidence
of
a
certain
peculiar
kind
now
when
i
speak
of
trusting
our
religious
demands
just
what
do
i
mean
by
is
the
word
to
carry
with
it
license
to
define
in
detail
an
invisible
world
and
to
anathematize
and
excommunicate
those
whose
trust
is
different
certainly
not
our
faculties
of
belief
were
not
primarily
given
us
to
make
orthodoxies
and
heresies
withal
they
were
given
us
to
live
by
and
to
trust
our
religious
demands
means
first
of
all
to
live
in
the
light
of
them
and
to
act
as
if
the
invisible
world
which
they
suggest
were
real
it
is
a
fact
of
human
nature
that
men
can
live
and
die
by
the
help
of
a
sort
of
faith
that
goes
without
a
single
dogma
or
definition
the
bare
assurance
that
this
natural
order
is
not
ultimate
but
a
mere
sign
or
vision
the
external
staging
of
a
universe
in
which
spiritual
forces
have
the
last
word
and
are
eternal
this
bare
assurance
is
to
such
men
enough
to
make
life
seem
worth
living
in
spite
of
every
contrary
presumption
suggested
by
its
circumstances
on
the
natural
plane
destroy
this
inner
assurance
however
vague
as
it
is
and
all
the
light
and
radiance
of
existence
is
extinguished
for
these
persons
at
a
stroke
often
enough
the
look
at
life
the
suicidal
mood
will
then
set
in
and
now
the
application
comes
directly
home
to
you
and
me
probably
to
almost
every
one
of
us
here
the
most
adverse
life
would
seem
well
worth
living
if
we
only
could
be
that
our
bravery
and
patience
with
it
were
terminating
and
eventuating
and
bearing
fruit
somewhere
in
an
unseen
spiritual
world
but
granting
we
are
not
certain
does
it
then
follow
that
a
bare
trust
in
such
a
world
is
a
fool
paradise
and
lubberland
or
rather
that
it
is
a
living
attitude
in
which
we
are
free
to
indulge
well
we
are
free
to
trust
at
our
own
risks
anything
that
is
not
impossible
and
that
can
bring
analogies
to
bear
in
its
behalf
that
the
world
of
physics
is
probably
not
absolute
all
the
converging
multitude
of
arguments
that
make
in
favor
of
idealism
tend
to
prove
and
that
our
whole
physical
life
may
lie
soaking
in
a
spiritual
atmosphere
a
dimension
of
being
that
we
at
present
have
no
organ
for
apprehending
is
vividly
suggested
to
us
by
the
analogy
of
the
life
of
our
domestic
animals
our
dogs
for
example
are
in
our
human
life
but
not
of
it
they
witness
hourly
the
outward
body
of
events
whose
inner
meaning
can
not
by
any
possible
operation
be
revealed
to
their
intelligence
events
in
which
they
themselves
often
play
the
cardinal
part
my
terrier
bites
a
teasing
boy
for
example
and
the
father
demands
damages
the
dog
may
be
present
at
every
step
of
the
negotiations
and
see
the
money
paid
without
an
inkling
of
what
it
all
means
without
a
suspicion
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
and
he
never
know
in
his
natural
dog
life
or
take
another
case
which
used
greatly
to
impress
me
in
my
days
consider
a
poor
dog
whom
they
are
vivisecting
in
a
laboratory
he
lies
strapped
on
a
board
and
shrieking
at
his
executioners
and
to
his
own
dark
consciousness
is
literally
in
a
sort
of
hell
he
can
not
see
a
single
redeeming
ray
in
the
whole
business
and
yet
all
these
events
are
often
controlled
by
human
intentions
with
which
if
his
poor
benighted
mind
could
only
be
made
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
all
that
is
heroic
in
him
would
religiously
acquiesce
healing
truth
relief
to
future
sufferings
of
beast
and
man
are
to
be
bought
by
them
it
may
be
genuinely
a
process
of
redemption
lying
on
his
back
on
the
board
there
he
may
be
performing
a
function
incalculably
higher
than
any
that
prosperous
canine
life
admits
of
and
yet
of
the
whole
performance
this
function
is
the
one
portion
that
must
remain
absolutely
beyond
his
ken
now
turn
from
this
to
the
life
of
man
in
the
dog
life
we
see
the
world
invisible
to
him
because
we
live
in
both
worlds
in
human
life
although
we
only
see
our
world
and
his
within
it
yet
encompassing
both
these
worlds
a
still
wider
world
may
be
there
as
unseen
by
us
as
our
world
is
by
him
and
to
believe
in
that
world
be
the
most
essential
function
that
our
lives
in
this
world
have
to
perform
but
be
be
one
now
hears
the
positivist
contemptuously
exclaim
what
use
can
a
scientific
life
have
for
maybes
well
i
reply
the
life
itself
has
much
to
do
with
maybes
and
human
life
at
large
has
everything
to
do
with
them
so
far
as
man
stands
for
anything
and
is
productive
or
originative
at
all
his
entire
vital
function
may
be
said
to
have
to
deal
with
maybes
not
a
victory
is
gained
not
a
deed
of
faithfulness
or
courage
is
done
except
upon
a
maybe
not
a
service
not
a
sally
of
generosity
not
a
scientific
exploration
or
experiment
or
that
may
not
be
a
mistake
it
is
only
by
risking
our
persons
from
one
hour
to
another
that
we
live
at
all
and
often
enough
our
faith
beforehand
in
an
uncertified
result
the
only
thing
that
makes
the
result
come
suppose
for
instance
that
you
are
climbing
a
mountain
and
have
worked
yourself
into
a
position
from
which
the
only
escape
is
by
a
terrible
leap
have
faith
that
you
can
successfully
make
it
and
your
feet
are
nerved
to
its
accomplishment
but
mistrust
yourself
and
think
of
all
the
sweet
things
you
have
heard
the
scientists
say
of
maybes
and
you
will
hesitate
so
long
that
at
last
all
unstrung
and
trembling
and
launching
yourself
in
a
moment
of
despair
you
roll
in
the
abyss
in
such
a
case
and
it
belongs
to
an
enormous
class
the
part
of
wisdom
as
well
as
of
courage
is
to
what
is
in
the
line
of
your
for
only
by
such
belief
is
the
need
fulfilled
refuse
to
believe
and
you
shall
indeed
be
right
for
you
shall
irretrievably
perish
but
believe
and
again
you
shall
be
right
for
you
shall
save
yourself
you
make
one
or
the
other
of
two
possible
universes
true
by
your
trust
or
mistrust
both
universes
having
been
only
in
this
particular
before
you
contributed
your
act
now
it
appears
to
me
that
the
question
whether
life
is
worth
living
is
subject
to
conditions
logically
much
like
these
it
does
indeed
depend
on
you
if
you
surrender
to
the
nightmare
view
and
crown
the
evil
edifice
by
your
own
suicide
you
have
indeed
made
a
picture
totally
black
pessimism
completed
by
your
act
is
true
beyond
a
doubt
so
far
as
your
world
goes
your
mistrust
of
life
has
removed
whatever
worth
your
own
enduring
existence
might
have
given
to
it
and
now
throughout
the
whole
sphere
of
possible
influence
of
that
existence
the
mistrust
has
proved
itself
to
have
had
divining
power
but
suppose
on
the
other
hand
that
instead
of
giving
way
to
the
nightmare
view
you
cling
to
it
that
this
world
is
not
the
suppose
you
find
yourself
a
very
as
wordsworth
says
of
zeal
and
the
virtue
to
exist
by
faith
as
soldiers
live
by
courage
as
by
strength
of
heart
the
sailor
fights
with
roaring
seas
suppose
however
thickly
evils
crowd
upon
you
that
your
unconquerable
subjectivity
proves
to
be
their
match
and
that
you
find
a
more
wonderful
joy
than
any
passive
pleasure
can
bring
in
trusting
ever
in
the
larger
whole
have
you
not
now
made
life
worth
living
on
these
terms
what
sort
of
a
thing
would
life
really
be
with
your
qualities
ready
for
a
tussle
with
it
if
it
only
brought
fair
weather
and
gave
these
higher
faculties
of
yours
no
scope
please
remember
that
optimism
and
pessimism
are
definitions
of
the
world
and
that
our
own
reactions
on
the
world
small
as
they
are
in
bulk
are
integral
parts
of
the
whole
thing
and
necessarily
help
to
determine
the
definition
they
may
even
be
the
decisive
elements
in
determining
the
definition
a
large
mass
can
have
its
unstable
equilibrium
overturned
by
the
addition
of
a
feather
weight
a
long
phrase
may
have
its
sense
reversed
by
the
addition
of
the
three
letters
this
life
is
worth
living
we
can
say
it
is
what
we
make
it
from
the
moral
point
of
and
we
are
determined
to
make
it
from
that
point
of
view
so
far
as
we
have
anything
to
do
with
it
a
success
now
in
this
description
of
faiths
that
verify
themselves
i
have
assumed
that
our
faith
in
an
invisible
order
is
what
inspires
those
efforts
and
that
patience
which
make
this
visible
order
good
for
moral
men
our
faith
in
the
seen
world
goodness
goodness
now
meaning
fitness
for
successful
moral
and
religious
life
has
verified
itself
by
leaning
on
our
faith
in
the
unseen
world
but
will
our
faith
in
the
unseen
world
similarly
verify
itself
who
knows
once
more
it
is
a
case
of
and
once
more
maybes
are
the
essence
of
the
situation
i
confess
that
i
do
not
see
why
the
very
existence
of
an
invisible
world
may
not
in
part
depend
on
the
personal
response
which
any
one
of
us
may
make
to
the
religious
appeal
god
himself
in
short
may
draw
vital
strength
and
increase
of
very
being
from
our
fidelity
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
know
what
the
sweat
and
blood
and
tragedy
of
this
life
mean
if
they
mean
anything
short
of
this
if
this
life
be
not
a
real
fight
in
which
something
is
eternally
gained
for
the
universe
by
success
it
is
no
better
than
a
game
of
private
theatricals
from
which
one
may
withdraw
at
will
but
it
like
a
real
fight
as
if
there
were
something
really
wild
in
the
universe
which
we
with
all
our
idealities
and
faithfulnesses
are
needed
to
redeem
and
first
of
all
to
redeem
our
own
hearts
from
atheisms
and
fears
for
such
a
universe
our
nature
is
adapted
the
deepest
thing
in
our
nature
is
this
as
a
german
doctor
lately
has
called
it
this
dumb
region
of
the
heart
in
which
we
dwell
alone
with
our
willingnesses
and
unwillingnesses
our
faiths
and
fears
as
through
the
cracks
and
crannies
of
caverns
those
waters
exude
from
the
earth
bosom
which
then
form
the
of
springs
so
in
these
crepuscular
depths
of
personality
the
sources
of
all
our
outer
deeds
and
decisions
take
their
rise
here
is
our
deepest
organ
of
communication
with
the
nature
of
things
and
compared
with
these
concrete
movements
of
our
soul
all
abstract
statements
and
scientific
arguments
the
veto
for
example
which
the
strict
positivist
pronounces
upon
our
faith
sound
to
us
like
mere
chatterings
of
the
teeth
for
here
possibilities
not
finished
facts
are
the
realities
with
which
we
have
actively
to
deal
and
to
quote
my
friend
william
salter
of
the
philadelphia
ethical
society
as
the
essence
of
courage
is
to
stake
one
life
on
a
possibility
so
the
essence
of
faith
is
to
believe
that
the
possibility
exists
these
then
are
my
last
words
to
you
be
not
afraid
of
life
believe
that
life
worth
living
and
your
belief
will
help
create
the
fact
the
proof
that
you
are
right
may
not
be
clear
before
the
day
of
judgment
or
some
stage
of
being
which
that
expression
may
serve
to
symbolize
is
reached
but
the
faithful
fighters
of
this
hour
or
the
beings
that
then
and
there
will
represent
them
may
then
turn
to
the
who
here
decline
to
go
on
with
words
like
those
with
which
henry
iv
greeted
the
tardy
crillon
after
a
great
victory
had
been
gained
hang
yourself
brave
crillon
we
fought
at
arques
and
you
were
not
there
an
address
to
the
harvard
young
men
christian
association
published
in
the
international
journal
of
ethics
for
october
and
as
a
pocket
volume
by
weston
philadelphia
quoted
by
george
waring
in
his
book
on
tyrol
compare
b√©rard
les
vaudois
lyon
storck
the
sentiment
of
rationality
i
what
is
the
task
which
philosophers
set
themselves
to
perform
and
why
do
they
philosophize
at
all
almost
every
one
will
immediately
reply
they
desire
to
attain
a
conception
of
the
frame
of
things
which
shall
on
the
whole
be
more
rational
than
that
somewhat
chaotic
view
which
every
one
by
nature
carries
about
with
him
under
his
hat
but
suppose
this
rational
conception
attained
how
is
the
philosopher
to
recognize
it
for
what
it
is
and
not
let
it
slip
through
ignorance
the
only
answer
can
be
that
he
will
recognize
its
rationality
as
he
recognizes
everything
else
by
certain
subjective
marks
with
which
it
affects
him
when
he
gets
the
marks
he
may
know
that
he
has
got
the
rationality
what
then
are
the
marks
a
strong
feeling
of
ease
peace
rest
is
one
of
them
the
transition
from
a
state
of
puzzle
and
perplexity
to
rational
comprehension
is
full
of
lively
relief
and
pleasure
but
this
relief
seems
to
be
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive
character
shall
we
then
say
that
the
feeling
of
rationality
is
constituted
merely
by
the
absence
of
any
feeling
of
irrationality
i
think
there
are
very
good
grounds
for
upholding
such
a
view
all
feeling
whatever
in
the
light
of
certain
recent
psychological
speculations
seems
to
depend
for
its
physical
condition
not
on
simple
discharge
of
but
on
their
discharge
under
arrest
impediment
or
resistance
just
as
we
feel
no
particular
pleasure
when
we
breathe
freely
but
a
very
intense
feeling
of
distress
when
the
respiratory
motions
are
prevented
so
any
unobstructed
tendency
to
action
discharges
itself
without
the
production
of
much
cogitative
accompaniment
and
any
perfectly
fluent
course
of
thought
awakens
but
little
feeling
but
when
the
movement
is
inhibited
or
when
the
thought
meets
with
difficulties
we
experience
distress
it
is
only
when
the
distress
is
upon
us
that
we
can
be
said
to
strive
to
crave
or
to
aspire
when
enjoying
plenary
freedom
either
in
the
way
of
motion
or
of
thought
we
are
in
a
sort
of
anaesthetic
state
in
which
we
might
say
with
walt
whitman
if
we
cared
to
say
anything
about
ourselves
at
such
times
i
am
sufficient
as
i
am
this
feeling
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
present
moment
of
its
absoluteness
this
absence
of
all
need
to
explain
it
account
for
it
or
justify
it
is
what
i
call
the
sentiment
of
rationality
as
soon
in
short
as
we
are
enabled
from
any
cause
whatever
to
think
with
perfect
fluency
the
thing
we
think
of
seems
to
us
rational
whatever
modes
of
conceiving
the
cosmos
facilitate
this
fluency
produce
the
sentiment
of
rationality
conceived
in
such
modes
being
vouches
for
itself
and
needs
no
further
philosophic
formulation
but
this
fluency
may
be
obtained
in
various
ways
and
first
i
will
take
up
the
theoretic
way
the
facts
of
the
world
in
their
sensible
diversity
are
always
before
us
but
our
theoretic
need
is
that
they
should
be
conceived
in
a
way
that
reduces
their
manifoldness
to
simplicity
our
pleasure
at
finding
that
a
chaos
of
facts
is
the
expression
of
a
single
underlying
fact
is
like
the
relief
of
the
musician
at
resolving
a
confused
mass
of
sound
into
melodic
or
harmonic
order
the
simplified
result
is
handled
with
far
less
mental
effort
than
the
original
data
and
a
philosophic
conception
of
nature
is
thus
in
no
metaphorical
sense
a
contrivance
the
passion
for
parsimony
for
economy
of
means
in
thought
is
the
philosophic
passion
and
any
character
or
aspect
of
the
world
phenomena
which
gathers
up
their
diversity
into
monotony
will
gratify
that
passion
and
in
the
philosopher
mind
stand
for
that
essence
of
things
compared
with
which
all
their
other
determinations
may
by
him
be
overlooked
more
universality
or
extensiveness
is
then
one
mark
which
the
philosopher
conceptions
must
possess
unless
they
apply
to
an
enormous
number
of
cases
they
will
not
bring
him
relief
the
knowledge
of
things
by
their
causes
which
is
often
given
as
a
definition
of
rational
knowledge
is
useless
to
him
unless
the
causes
converge
to
a
minimum
number
while
still
producing
the
maximum
number
of
effects
the
more
multiple
then
are
the
instances
the
more
flowingly
does
his
mind
rove
from
fact
to
fact
the
phenomenal
transitions
are
no
real
transitions
each
item
is
the
same
old
friend
with
a
slightly
altered
dress
who
does
not
feel
the
charm
of
thinking
that
the
moon
and
the
apple
are
as
far
as
their
relation
to
the
earth
goes
identical
of
knowing
respiration
and
combustion
to
be
one
of
understanding
that
the
balloon
rises
by
the
same
law
whereby
the
stone
sinks
of
feeling
that
the
warmth
in
one
palm
when
one
rubs
one
sleeve
is
identical
with
the
motion
which
the
friction
checks
of
recognizing
the
difference
between
beast
and
fish
to
be
only
a
higher
degree
of
that
between
human
father
and
son
of
believing
our
strength
when
we
climb
the
mountain
or
fell
the
tree
to
be
no
other
than
the
strength
of
the
sun
rays
which
made
the
corn
grow
out
of
which
we
got
our
morning
meal
but
alongside
of
this
passion
for
simplification
there
exists
a
sister
passion
which
in
some
minds
though
they
perhaps
form
the
minority
is
its
rival
this
is
the
passion
for
distinguishing
it
is
the
impulse
to
be
with
the
parts
rather
than
to
comprehend
the
whole
loyalty
to
clearness
and
integrity
of
perception
dislike
of
blurred
outlines
of
vague
identifications
are
its
characteristics
it
loves
to
recognize
particulars
in
their
full
completeness
and
the
more
of
these
it
can
carry
the
happier
it
is
it
prefers
any
amount
of
incoherence
abruptness
and
fragmentariness
so
long
as
the
literal
details
of
the
separate
facts
are
saved
to
an
abstract
way
of
conceiving
things
that
while
it
simplifies
them
dissolves
away
at
the
same
time
their
concrete
fulness
clearness
and
simplicity
thus
set
up
rival
claims
and
make
a
real
dilemma
for
the
thinker
a
man
philosophic
attitude
is
determined
by
the
balance
in
him
of
these
two
cravings
no
system
of
philosophy
can
hope
to
be
universally
accepted
among
men
which
grossly
violates
either
need
or
entirely
subordinates
the
one
to
the
other
the
fate
of
spinosa
with
his
barren
union
of
all
things
in
one
substance
on
the
one
hand
that
of
hume
with
his
equally
barren
and
separateness
of
everything
on
the
other
neither
philosopher
owning
any
strict
and
systematic
disciples
each
being
to
posterity
a
warning
as
well
as
a
stimulus
show
us
that
the
only
possible
philosophy
must
be
a
compromise
between
an
abstract
monotony
and
a
concrete
heterogeneity
but
the
only
way
to
mediate
between
diversity
and
unity
is
to
class
the
diverse
items
as
cases
of
a
common
essence
which
you
discover
in
them
classification
of
things
into
extensive
is
thus
the
first
step
and
classification
of
their
relations
and
conduct
into
extensive
is
the
last
step
in
their
philosophic
unification
a
completed
theoretic
philosophy
can
thus
never
be
anything
more
than
a
completed
classification
of
the
world
ingredients
and
its
results
must
always
be
abstract
since
the
basis
of
every
classification
is
the
abstract
essence
embedded
in
the
living
fact
the
rest
of
the
living
fact
being
for
the
time
ignored
by
the
classifier
this
means
that
none
of
our
explanations
are
complete
they
subsume
things
under
heads
wider
or
more
familiar
but
the
last
heads
whether
of
things
or
of
their
connections
are
mere
abstract
genera
data
which
we
just
find
in
things
and
write
down
when
for
example
we
think
that
we
have
rationally
explained
the
connection
of
the
facts
and
by
classing
both
under
their
common
attribute
it
is
obvious
that
we
have
really
explained
only
so
much
of
these
items
as
to
explain
the
connection
of
and
suffocation
by
the
lack
of
oxygen
is
to
leave
untouched
all
the
other
peculiarities
both
of
and
of
suffocation
such
as
convulsions
and
agony
on
the
one
hand
density
and
explosibility
on
the
other
in
a
word
so
far
as
and
contain
and
respectively
in
addition
to
they
are
not
explained
by
each
additional
particularity
makes
its
distinct
appeal
a
single
explanation
of
a
fact
only
explains
it
from
a
single
point
of
view
the
entire
fact
is
not
accounted
for
until
each
and
all
of
its
characters
have
been
classed
with
their
likes
elsewhere
to
apply
this
now
to
the
case
of
the
universe
we
see
that
the
explanation
of
the
world
by
molecular
movements
explains
it
only
so
far
as
it
actually
such
movements
to
invoke
the
explains
only
so
much
as
is
unknowable
only
so
much
as
is
thought
only
so
much
as
is
god
thought
god
are
questions
that
have
to
be
answered
by
bringing
in
again
the
residual
data
from
which
the
general
term
was
abstracted
all
those
data
that
can
not
be
analytically
identified
with
the
attribute
invoked
as
universal
principle
remain
as
independent
kinds
or
natures
associated
empirically
with
the
said
attribute
but
devoid
of
rational
kinship
with
it
hence
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
all
our
speculations
on
the
one
hand
so
far
as
they
retain
any
multiplicity
in
their
terms
they
fail
to
get
us
out
of
the
empirical
world
on
the
other
so
far
as
they
eliminate
multiplicity
the
practical
man
despises
their
empty
barrenness
the
most
they
can
say
is
that
the
elements
of
the
world
are
such
and
such
and
that
each
is
identical
with
itself
wherever
found
but
the
question
where
is
it
found
the
practical
man
is
left
to
answer
by
his
own
wit
which
of
all
the
essences
shall
here
and
now
be
held
the
essence
of
this
concrete
thing
the
fundamental
philosophy
never
attempts
to
decide
we
are
thus
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
simple
classification
of
things
is
on
the
one
hand
the
best
possible
theoretic
philosophy
but
is
on
the
other
a
most
miserable
and
inadequate
substitute
for
the
fulness
of
the
truth
it
is
a
monstrous
abridgment
of
life
which
like
all
abridgments
is
got
by
the
absolute
loss
and
casting
out
of
real
matter
this
is
why
so
few
human
beings
truly
care
for
philosophy
the
particular
determinations
which
she
ignores
are
the
real
matter
exciting
needs
quite
as
potent
and
authoritative
as
hers
what
does
the
moral
enthusiast
care
for
philosophical
ethics
why
does
the
of
every
german
philosopher
appear
to
the
artist
an
abomination
of
desolation
grau
theurer

the
entire
man
who
feels
all
needs
by
turns
will
take
nothing
as
an
equivalent
for
life
but
the
fulness
of
living
itself
since
the
essences
of
things
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
disseminated
through
the
whole
extent
of
time
and
space
it
is
in
their
and
alternation
that
he
will
enjoy
them
when
weary
of
the
concrete
clash
and
dust
and
pettiness
he
will
refresh
himself
by
a
bath
in
the
eternal
springs
or
fortify
himself
by
a
look
at
the
immutable
natures
but
he
will
only
be
a
visitor
not
a
dweller
in
the
region
he
will
never
carry
the
philosophic
yoke
upon
his
shoulders
and
when
tired
of
the
gray
monotony
of
her
problems
and
insipid
spaciousness
of
her
results
will
always
escape
gleefully
into
the
teeming
and
dramatic
richness
of
the
concrete
world
so
our
study
turns
back
here
to
its
beginning
every
way
of
classifying
a
thing
is
but
a
way
of
handling
it
for
some
particular
purpose
conceptions
are
teleological
instruments
no
abstract
concept
can
be
a
valid
substitute
for
a
concrete
reality
except
with
reference
to
a
particular
interest
in
the
conceiver
the
interest
of
theoretic
rationality
the
relief
of
identification
is
but
one
of
a
thousand
human
purposes
when
others
rear
their
heads
it
must
pack
up
its
little
bundle
and
retire
till
its
turn
recurs
the
exaggerated
dignity
and
value
that
philosophers
have
claimed
for
their
solutions
is
thus
greatly
reduced
the
only
virtue
their
theoretic
conception
need
have
is
simplicity
and
a
simple
conception
is
an
equivalent
for
the
world
only
so
far
as
the
world
is
simple
the
world
meanwhile
whatever
simplicity
it
may
harbor
being
also
a
mightily
complex
affair
enough
simplicity
remains
however
and
enough
urgency
in
our
craving
to
reach
it
to
make
the
theoretic
function
one
of
the
most
invincible
of
human
impulses
the
quest
of
the
fewest
elements
of
things
is
an
ideal
that
some
will
follow
as
long
as
there
are
men
to
think
at
all
but
suppose
the
goal
attained
suppose
that
at
last
we
have
a
system
unified
in
the
sense
that
has
been
explained
our
world
can
now
be
conceived
simply
and
our
mind
enjoys
the
relief
our
universal
concept
has
made
the
concrete
chaos
rational
but
now
i
ask
can
that
which
is
the
ground
of
rationality
in
all
else
be
itself
properly
called
rational
it
would
seem
at
first
sight
that
it
might
one
is
tempted
at
any
rate
to
say
that
since
the
craving
for
rationality
is
appeased
by
the
identification
of
one
thing
with
another
a
datum
which
left
nothing
else
outstanding
might
quench
that
craving
definitively
or
be
rational
no
otherness
being
left
to
annoy
us
we
should
sit
down
at
peace
in
other
words
as
the
theoretic
tranquillity
of
the
boor
results
from
his
spinning
no
further
considerations
about
his
chaotic
universe
so
any
datum
whatever
provided
it
were
simple
clear
and
ultimate
ought
to
banish
puzzle
from
the
universe
of
the
philosopher
and
confer
peace
inasmuch
as
there
would
then
be
for
him
absolutely
no
further
considerations
to
spin
this
in
fact
is
what
some
persons
think
professor
bain
says
a
difficulty
is
solved
a
mystery
unriddled
when
it
can
be
shown
to
resemble
something
else
to
be
an
example
of
a
fact
already
known
mystery
is
isolation
exception
or
it
may
be
apparent
contradiction
the
resolution
of
the
mystery
is
found
in
assimilation
identity
fraternity
when
all
things
are
assimilated
so
far
as
assimilation
can
go
so
far
as
likeness
holds
there
is
an
end
to
explanation
there
is
an
end
to
what
the
mind
can
do
or
can
intelligently
desire
the
path
of
science
as
exhibited
in
modern
ages
is
toward
generality
wider
and
wider
until
we
reach
the
highest
the
widest
laws
of
every
department
of
things
there
explanation
is
finished
mystery
ends
perfect
vision
is
gained
but
unfortunately
this
first
answer
will
not
hold
our
mind
is
so
wedded
to
the
process
of
seeing
an
beside
every
item
of
its
experience
that
when
the
notion
of
an
absolute
datum
is
presented
to
it
it
goes
through
its
usual
procedure
and
remains
pointing
at
the
void
beyond
as
if
in
that
lay
further
matter
for
contemplation
in
short
it
spins
for
itself
the
further
positive
consideration
of
a
nonentity
enveloping
the
being
of
its
datum
and
as
that
leads
nowhere
back
recoils
the
thought
toward
its
datum
again
but
there
is
no
natural
bridge
between
nonentity
and
this
particular
datum
and
the
thought
stands
oscillating
to
and
fro
wondering
why
was
there
anything
but
nonentity
why
just
this
universal
datum
and
not
another
and
finds
no
end
in
wandering
mazes
lost
indeed
bain
words
are
so
untrue
that
in
reflecting
men
it
is
just
when
the
attempt
to
fuse
the
manifold
into
a
single
totality
has
been
most
successful
when
the
conception
of
the
universe
as
a
unique
fact
is
nearest
its
perfection
that
the
craving
for
further
explanation
the
ontological
arises
in
its
extremest
form
as
schopenhauer
says
the
uneasiness
which
keeps
the
clock
of
metaphysics
in
motion
is
the
consciousness
that
the
of
this
world
is
just
as
possible
as
its
existence
the
notion
of
nonentity
may
thus
be
called
the
parent
of
the
philosophic
craving
in
its
subtilest
and
profoundest
sense
absolute
existence
is
absolute
mystery
for
its
relations
with
the
nothing
remain
unmediated
to
our
understanding
one
philosopher
only
has
pretended
to
throw
a
logical
bridge
over
this
chasm
hegel
by
trying
to
show
that
nonentity
and
concrete
being
are
linked
together
by
a
series
of
identities
of
a
synthetic
kind
binds
everything
conceivable
into
a
unity
with
no
outlying
notion
to
disturb
the
free
rotary
circulation
of
the
mind
within
its
bounds
since
such
unchecked
movement
gives
the
feeling
of
rationality
he
must
be
held
if
he
has
succeeded
to
have
eternally
and
absolutely
quenched
all
rational
demands
but
for
those
who
deem
hegel
heroic
effort
to
have
failed
nought
remains
but
to
confess
that
when
all
things
have
been
unified
to
the
supreme
degree
the
notion
of
a
possible
other
than
the
actual
may
still
haunt
our
imagination
and
prey
upon
our
system
the
bottom
of
being
is
left
logically
opaque
to
us
as
something
which
we
simply
come
upon
and
find
and
about
which
if
we
wish
to
act
we
should
pause
and
wonder
as
little
as
possible
the
philosopher
logical
tranquillity
is
thus
in
essence
no
other
than
the
boor
they
differ
only
as
to
the
point
at
which
each
refuses
to
let
further
considerations
upset
the
absoluteness
of
the
data
he
assumes
the
boor
does
so
immediately
and
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
the
ravages
of
many
kinds
of
doubt
the
philosopher
does
not
do
so
till
unity
has
been
reached
and
is
warranted
against
the
inroads
of
those
considerations
but
only
practically
not
essentially
secure
from
the
blighting
breath
of
the
ultimate
why
if
he
can
not
exorcise
this
question
he
must
ignore
or
blink
it
and
assuming
the
data
of
his
system
as
something
given
and
the
gift
as
ultimate
simply
proceed
to
a
life
of
contemplation
or
of
action
based
on
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
acting
on
an
opaque
necessity
is
accompanied
by
a
certain
pleasure
see
the
reverence
of
carlyle
for
brute
fact
there
is
an
infinite
significance
in
fact
necessity
says
d√ºhring
and
he
means
not
rational
but
given
necessity
is
the
last
and
highest
point
that
we
can
reach
it
is
not
only
the
interest
of
ultimate
and
definitive
knowledge
but
also
that
of
the
feelings
to
find
a
last
repose
and
an
ideal
equilibrium
in
an
uttermost
datum
which
can
simply
not
be
other
than
it
is
such
is
the
attitude
of
ordinary
men
in
their
theism
god
fiat
being
in
physics
and
morals
such
an
uttermost
datum
such
also
is
the
attitude
of
all
analysts
and
lotze
renouvier
and
hodgson
promptly
say
that
of
experience
as
a
whole
no
account
can
be
given
but
neither
seek
to
soften
the
abruptness
of
the
confession
nor
to
reconcile
us
with
our
impotence
but
mediating
attempts
may
be
made
by
more
mystical
minds
the
peace
of
rationality
may
be
sought
through
ecstasy
when
logic
fails
to
religious
persons
of
every
shade
of
doctrine
moments
come
when
the
world
as
it
is
seems
so
divinely
orderly
and
the
acceptance
of
it
by
the
heart
so
rapturously
complete
that
intellectual
questions
vanish
nay
the
intellect
itself
is
hushed
to
sleep
as
wordsworth
says
thought
is
not
in
enjoyment
it
expires
ontological
emotion
so
fills
the
soul
that
ontological
speculation
can
no
longer
overlap
it
and
put
her
girdle
of
round
existence
even
the
least
religious
of
men
must
have
felt
with
walt
whitman
when
loafing
on
the
grass
on
some
transparent
summer
morning
that
swiftly
arose
and
spread
round
him
the
peace
and
knowledge
that
pass
all
the
argument
of
the
earth
at
such
moments
of
energetic
living
we
feel
as
if
there
were
something
diseased
and
contemptible
yea
vile
in
theoretic
grubbing
and
brooding
in
the
eye
of
healthy
sense
the
philosopher
is
at
best
a
learned
fool
since
the
heart
can
thus
wall
out
the
ultimate
irrationality
which
the
head
ascertains
the
erection
of
its
procedure
into
a
systematized
method
would
be
a
philosophic
achievement
of
importance
but
as
used
by
mystics
hitherto
it
has
lacked
universality
being
available
for
few
persons
and
at
few
times
and
even
in
these
being
apt
to
be
followed
by
fits
of
reaction
and
dryness
and
if
men
should
agree
that
the
mystical
method
is
a
subterfuge
without
logical
pertinency
a
plaster
but
no
cure
and
that
the
idea
of
can
never
be
exorcised
empiricism
will
be
the
ultimate
philosophy
existence
then
will
be
a
brute
fact
to
which
as
a
whole
the
emotion
of
ontologic
wonder
shall
rightfully
cleave
but
remain
eternally
unsatisfied
then
wonderfulness
or
mysteriousness
will
be
an
essential
attribute
of
the
nature
of
things
and
the
exhibition
and
emphasizing
of
it
will
continue
to
be
an
ingredient
in
the
philosophic
industry
of
the
race
every
generation
will
produce
its
job
its
hamlet
its
faust
or
its
sartor
resartus
with
this
we
seem
to
have
considered
the
possibilities
of
purely
theoretic
rationality
but
we
saw
at
the
outset
that
rationality
meant
only
unimpeded
mental
function
impediments
that
arise
in
the
theoretic
sphere
might
perhaps
be
avoided
if
the
stream
of
mental
action
should
leave
that
sphere
betimes
and
pass
into
the
practical
let
us
therefore
inquire
what
constitutes
the
feeling
of
rationality
in
its
aspect
if
thought
is
not
to
stand
forever
pointing
at
the
universe
in
wonder
if
its
movement
is
to
be
diverted
from
the
issueless
channel
of
purely
theoretic
contemplation
let
us
ask
what
conception
of
the
universe
will
awaken
active
impulses
capable
of
effecting
this
diversion
a
definition
of
the
world
which
will
give
back
to
the
mind
the
free
motion
which
has
been
blocked
in
the
purely
contemplative
path
may
so
far
make
the
world
seem
rational
again
well
of
two
conceptions
equally
fit
to
satisfy
the
logical
demand
that
one
which
awakens
the
active
impulses
or
satisfies
other
aesthetic
demands
better
than
the
other
will
be
accounted
the
more
rational
conception
and
will
deservedly
prevail
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
the
supposition
that
an
analysis
of
the
world
may
yield
a
number
of
formulae
all
consistent
with
the
facts
in
physical
science
different
formulae
may
explain
the
phenomena
equally
well
the
and
the
theories
of
electricity
for
example
why
may
it
not
be
so
with
the
world
why
may
there
not
be
different
points
of
view
for
surveying
it
within
each
of
which
all
data
harmonize
and
which
the
observer
may
therefore
either
choose
between
or
simply
cumulate
one
upon
another
a
beethoven
is
truly
as
some
one
has
said
a
scraping
of
tails
on
cats
bowels
and
may
be
exhaustively
described
in
such
terms
but
the
application
of
this
description
in
no
way
precludes
the
simultaneous
applicability
of
an
entirely
different
description
just
so
a
interpretation
of
the
world
in
terms
of
mechanical
sequence
is
compatible
with
its
being
interpreted
teleologically
for
the
mechanism
itself
may
be
designed
if
then
there
were
several
systems
excogitated
equally
satisfying
to
our
purely
logical
needs
they
would
still
have
to
be
passed
in
review
and
approved
or
rejected
by
our
aesthetic
and
practical
nature
can
we
define
the
tests
of
rationality
which
these
parts
of
our
nature
would
use
philosophers
long
ago
observed
the
remarkable
fact
that
mere
familiarity
with
things
is
able
to
produce
a
feeling
of
their
rationality
the
empiricist
school
has
been
so
much
struck
by
this
circumstance
as
to
have
laid
it
down
that
the
feeling
of
rationality
and
the
feeling
of
familiarity
are
one
and
the
same
thing
and
that
no
other
kind
of
rationality
than
this
exists
the
daily
contemplation
of
phenomena
juxtaposed
in
a
certain
order
begets
an
acceptance
of
their
connection
as
absolute
as
the
repose
engendered
by
theoretic
insight
into
their
coherence
to
explain
a
thing
is
to
pass
easily
back
to
its
antecedents
to
know
it
is
easily
to
foresee
its
consequents
custom
which
lets
us
do
both
is
thus
the
source
of
whatever
rationality
the
thing
may
gain
in
our
thought
in
the
broad
sense
in
which
rationality
was
defined
at
the
outset
of
this
essay
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
custom
must
be
one
of
its
factors
we
said
that
any
perfectly
fluent
and
easy
thought
was
devoid
of
the
sentiment
of
irrationality
inasmuch
then
as
custom
acquaints
us
with
all
the
relations
of
a
thing
it
teaches
us
to
pass
fluently
from
that
thing
to
others
and
tinges
it
with
the
rational
character
now
there
is
one
particular
relation
of
greater
practical
importance
than
all
the
rest
i
mean
the
relation
of
a
thing
to
its
future
consequences
so
long
as
an
object
is
unusual
our
expectations
are
baffled
they
are
fully
determined
as
soon
as
it
becomes
familiar
i
therefore
propose
this
as
the
first
practical
requisite
which
a
philosophic
conception
must
satisfy
must
in
a
general
way
at
least
banish
uncertainty
from
the
the
permanent
presence
of
the
sense
of
futurity
in
the
mind
has
been
strangely
ignored
by
most
writers
but
the
fact
is
that
our
consciousness
at
a
given
moment
is
never
free
from
the
ingredient
of
expectancy
every
one
knows
how
when
a
painful
thing
has
to
be
undergone
in
the
near
future
the
vague
feeling
that
it
is
impending
penetrates
all
our
thought
with
uneasiness
and
subtly
vitiates
our
mood
even
when
it
does
not
control
our
attention
it
keeps
us
from
being
at
rest
at
home
in
the
given
present
the
same
is
true
when
a
great
happiness
awaits
us
but
when
the
future
is
neutral
and
perfectly
certain
do
not
mind
it
as
we
say
but
give
an
undisturbed
attention
to
the
actual
let
now
this
haunting
sense
of
futurity
be
thrown
off
its
bearings
or
left
without
an
object
and
immediately
uneasiness
takes
possession
of
the
mind
but
in
every
novel
or
unclassified
experience
this
is
just
what
occurs
we
do
not
know
what
will
come
next
and
novelty
becomes
a
mental
irritant
while
custom
is
a
mental
sedative
merely
because
the
one
baffles
while
the
other
settles
our
expectations
every
reader
must
feel
the
truth
of
this
what
is
meant
by
coming
feel
at
home
in
a
new
place
or
with
new
people
it
is
simply
that
at
first
when
we
take
up
our
quarters
in
a
new
room
we
do
not
know
what
draughts
may
blow
in
upon
our
back
what
doors
may
open
what
forms
may
enter
what
interesting
objects
may
be
found
in
cupboards
and
corners
when
after
a
few
days
we
have
learned
the
range
of
all
these
possibilities
the
feeling
of
strangeness
disappears
and
so
it
does
with
people
when
we
have
got
past
the
point
of
expecting
any
essentially
new
manifestations
from
their
character
the
utility
of
this
emotional
effect
of
expectation
is
perfectly
obvious
selection
in
fact
was
bound
to
bring
it
about
sooner
or
later
it
is
of
the
utmost
practical
importance
to
an
animal
that
he
should
have
prevision
of
the
qualities
of
the
objects
that
surround
him
and
especially
that
he
should
not
come
to
rest
in
presence
of
circumstances
that
might
be
fraught
either
with
peril
or
advantage
go
to
sleep
for
example
on
the
brink
of
precipices
in
the
dens
of
enemies
or
view
with
indifference
some
object
that
might
if
chased
prove
an
important
addition
to
the
larder
novelty
to
irritate
him
all
curiosity
has
thus
a
practical
genesis
we
need
only
look
at
the
physiognomy
of
a
dog
or
a
horse
when
a
new
object
comes
into
his
view
his
mingled
fascination
and
fear
to
see
that
the
element
of
conscious
insecurity
or
perplexed
expectation
lies
at
the
root
of
his
emotion
a
dog
curiosity
about
the
movements
of
his
master
or
a
strange
object
only
extends
as
far
as
the
point
of
deciding
what
is
going
to
happen
next
that
settled
curiosity
is
quenched
the
dog
quoted
by
darwin
whose
behavior
in
presence
of
a
newspaper
moved
by
the
wind
seemed
to
testify
to
a
sense
the
supernatural
was
merely
exhibiting
the
irritation
of
an
uncertain
future
a
newspaper
which
could
move
spontaneously
was
in
itself
so
unexpected
that
the
poor
brute
could
not
tell
what
new
wonders
the
next
moment
might
bring
forth
to
turn
back
now
to
philosophy
an
ultimate
datum
even
though
it
be
logically
unrationalized
will
if
its
quality
is
such
as
to
define
expectancy
be
peacefully
accepted
by
the
mind
while
if
it
leave
the
least
opportunity
for
ambiguity
in
the
future
it
will
to
that
extent
cause
mental
uneasiness
if
not
distress
now
in
the
ultimate
explanations
of
the
universe
which
the
craving
for
rationality
has
elicited
from
the
human
mind
the
demands
of
expectancy
to
be
satisfied
have
always
played
a
fundamental
part
the
term
set
up
by
philosophers
as
primordial
has
been
one
which
banishes
the
incalculable
for
example
means
as
kant
says
which
will
be
as
it
has
been
because
its
being
is
essential
and
eternal
and
although
we
may
not
be
able
to
prophesy
in
detail
the
future
phenomena
to
which
the
substance
shall
give
rise
we
may
set
our
minds
at
rest
in
a
general
way
when
we
have
called
the
substance
god
perfection
love
or
reason
by
the
reflection
that
whatever
is
in
store
for
us
can
never
at
bottom
be
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
this
term
so
that
our
attitude
even
toward
the
unexpected
is
in
a
general
sense
defined
take
again
the
notion
of
immortality
which
for
common
people
seems
to
be
the
touchstone
of
every
philosophic
or
religious
creed
what
is
this
but
a
way
of
saying
that
the
determination
of
expectancy
is
the
essential
factor
of
rationality
the
wrath
of
science
against
miracles
of
certain
philosophers
against
the
doctrine
of
has
precisely
the
same
root
dislike
to
admit
any
ultimate
factor
in
things
which
may
rout
our
prevision
or
upset
the
stability
of
our
outlook
writers
strangely
overlook
this
function
in
the
doctrine
of
substance
if
there
be
such
a
says
mill
suppose
it
at
this
instant
miraculously
annihilated
and
let
the
sensations
continue
to
occur
in
the
same
order
and
how
would
the
be
missed
by
what
signs
should
we
be
able
to
discover
that
its
existence
had
terminated
should
we
not
have
as
much
reason
to
believe
that
it
still
existed
as
we
now
have
and
if
we
should
not
then
be
warranted
in
believing
it
how
can
we
be
so
now
truly
enough
if
we
have
already
securely
bagged
our
facts
in
a
certain
order
we
can
dispense
with
any
further
warrant
for
that
order
but
with
regard
to
the
facts
yet
to
come
the
case
is
far
different
it
does
not
follow
that
if
substance
may
be
dropped
from
our
conception
of
the
irrecoverably
past
it
need
be
an
equally
empty
complication
to
our
notions
of
the
future
even
if
it
were
true
that
for
aught
we
know
to
the
contrary
the
substance
might
develop
at
any
moment
a
wholly
new
set
of
attributes
the
mere
logical
form
of
referring
things
to
a
substance
would
still
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
remain
accompanied
by
a
feeling
of
rest
and
future
confidence
in
spite
of
the
acutest
nihilistic
criticism
men
will
therefore
always
have
a
liking
for
any
philosophy
which
explains
things
a
very
natural
reaction
against
the
theosophizing
conceit
and
confidence
in
the
upshot
of
things
which
vulgarly
optimistic
minds
display
has
formed
one
factor
of
the
scepticism
of
empiricists
who
never
cease
to
remind
us
of
the
reservoir
of
possibilities
alien
to
our
habitual
experience
which
the
cosmos
may
contain
and
which
for
any
warrant
we
have
to
the
contrary
may
turn
it
inside
out
agnostic
substantialism
like
that
of
spencer
whose
unknowable
is
not
merely
the
unfathomable
but
the
on
which
if
consistently
represented
in
thought
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
count
performs
the
same
function
of
rebuking
a
certain
stagnancy
and
smugness
in
the
manner
in
which
the
ordinary
philistine
feels
his
security
but
considered
as
anything
else
than
as
reactions
against
an
opposite
excess
these
philosophies
of
uncertainty
can
not
be
acceptable
the
general
mind
will
fail
to
come
to
rest
in
their
presence
and
will
seek
for
solutions
of
a
more
reassuring
kind
we
may
then
i
think
with
perfect
confidence
lay
down
as
a
first
point
gained
in
our
inquiry
that
a
prime
factor
in
the
philosophic
craving
is
the
desire
to
have
expectancy
defined
and
that
no
philosophy
will
definitively
triumph
which
in
an
emphatic
manner
denies
the
possibility
of
gratifying
this
need
we
pass
with
this
to
the
next
great
division
of
our
topic
it
is
not
sufficient
for
our
satisfaction
merely
to
know
the
future
as
determined
for
it
may
be
determined
in
either
of
many
ways
agreeable
or
disagreeable
for
a
philosophy
to
succeed
on
a
universal
scale
it
must
define
the
future
with
our
spontaneous
a
philosophy
may
be
unimpeachable
in
other
respects
but
either
of
two
defects
will
be
fatal
to
its
universal
acceptance
first
its
ultimate
principle
must
not
be
one
that
essentially
baffles
and
disappoints
our
dearest
desires
and
most
cherished
powers
a
pessimistic
principle
like
schopenhauer
incurably
vicious
or
wicked
the
unconscious
will
perpetually
call
forth
essays
at
other
philosophies
incompatibility
of
the
future
with
their
desires
and
active
tendencies
is
in
fact
to
most
men
a
source
of
more
fixed
disquietude
than
uncertainty
itself
witness
the
attempts
to
overcome
the
of
evil
the
of
pain
there
is
no
of
good
but
a
second
and
worse
defect
in
a
philosophy
than
that
of
contradicting
our
active
propensities
is
to
give
them
no
object
whatever
to
press
against
a
philosophy
whose
principle
is
so
incommensurate
with
our
most
intimate
powers
as
to
deny
them
all
relevancy
in
universal
affairs
as
to
annihilate
their
motives
at
one
blow
will
be
even
more
unpopular
than
pessimism
better
face
the
enemy
than
the
eternal
void
this
is
why
materialism
will
always
fail
of
universal
adoption
however
well
it
may
fuse
things
into
an
atomistic
unity
however
clearly
it
may
prophesy
the
future
eternity
for
materialism
denies
reality
to
the
objects
of
almost
all
the
impulses
which
we
most
cherish
the
real
of
the
impulses
it
says
is
something
which
has
no
emotional
interest
for
us
whatever
now
what
is
called
is
quite
as
characteristic
of
our
emotions
as
of
our
senses
both
point
to
an
object
as
the
cause
of
the
present
feeling
what
an
intensely
objective
reference
lies
in
fear
in
like
manner
an
enraptured
man
and
a
man
are
not
simply
aware
of
their
subjective
states
if
they
were
the
force
of
their
feelings
would
all
evaporate
both
believe
there
is
outward
cause
why
they
should
feel
as
they
do
either
it
is
a
glad
world
how
good
life
is
or
what
a
loathsome
tedium
is
existence
any
philosophy
which
annihilates
the
validity
of
the
reference
by
explaining
away
its
objects
or
translating
them
into
terms
of
no
emotional
pertinency
leaves
the
mind
with
little
to
care
or
act
for
this
is
the
opposite
condition
from
that
of
nightmare
but
when
acutely
brought
home
to
consciousness
it
produces
a
kindred
horror
in
nightmare
we
have
motives
to
act
but
no
power
here
we
have
powers
but
no
motives
a
nameless
comes
over
us
at
the
thought
of
there
being
nothing
eternal
in
our
final
purposes
in
the
objects
of
those
loves
and
aspirations
which
are
our
deepest
energies
the
monstrously
lopsided
equation
of
the
universe
and
its
knower
which
we
postulate
as
the
ideal
of
cognition
is
perfectly
paralleled
by
the
no
less
lopsided
equation
of
the
universe
and
the
we
demand
in
it
a
character
for
which
our
emotions
and
active
propensities
shall
be
a
match
small
as
we
are
minute
as
is
the
point
by
which
the
cosmos
impinges
upon
each
one
of
us
each
one
desires
to
feel
that
his
reaction
at
that
point
is
congruous
with
the
demands
of
the
vast
whole
that
he
balances
the
latter
so
to
speak
and
is
able
to
do
what
it
expects
of
him
but
as
his
abilities
to
do
lie
wholly
in
the
line
of
his
natural
propensities
as
he
enjoys
reacting
with
such
emotions
as
fortitude
hope
rapture
admiration
earnestness
and
the
like
and
as
he
very
unwillingly
reacts
with
fear
disgust
despair
or
doubt
a
philosophy
which
should
only
legitimate
emotions
of
the
latter
sort
would
be
sure
to
leave
the
mind
a
prey
to
discontent
and
craving
it
is
far
too
little
recognized
how
entirely
the
intellect
is
built
up
of
practical
interests
the
theory
of
evolution
is
beginning
to
do
very
good
service
by
its
reduction
of
all
mentality
to
the
type
of
reflex
action
cognition
in
this
view
is
but
a
fleeting
moment
a
at
a
certain
point
of
what
in
its
totality
is
a
motor
phenomenon
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
no
one
will
pretend
that
cognition
is
anything
more
than
a
guide
to
appropriate
action
the
germinal
question
concerning
things
brought
for
the
first
time
before
consciousness
is
not
the
theoretic
is
that
but
the
practical
goes
there
or
rather
as
horwicz
has
admirably
put
it
is
to
be
done
fang
ich
an
in
all
our
discussions
about
the
intelligence
of
lower
animals
the
only
test
we
use
is
that
of
their
as
if
for
a
purpose
cognition
in
short
is
incomplete
until
discharged
in
act
and
although
it
is
true
that
the
later
mental
development
which
attains
its
maximum
through
the
hypertrophied
cerebrum
of
man
gives
birth
to
a
vast
amount
of
theoretic
activity
over
and
above
that
which
is
immediately
ministerial
to
practice
yet
the
earlier
claim
is
only
postponed
not
effaced
and
the
active
nature
asserts
its
rights
to
the
end
when
the
cosmos
in
its
totality
is
the
object
offered
to
consciousness
the
relation
is
in
no
whit
altered
react
on
it
we
must
in
some
congenial
way
it
was
a
deep
instinct
in
schopenhauer
which
led
him
to
reinforce
his
pessimistic
argumentation
by
a
running
volley
of
invective
against
the

no

is
slain
helmholtz
immortal
works
on
the
eye
and
ear
are
to
a
great
extent
little
more
than
a
commentary
on
the
law
that
practical
utility
wholly
determines
which
parts
of
our
sensations
we
shall
be
aware
of
and
which
parts
we
shall
ignore
we
notice
or
discriminate
an
ingredient
of
sense
only
so
far
as
we
depend
upon
it
to
modify
our
actions
we
a
thing
when
we
synthetize
it
by
identity
with
another
thing
but
the
other
great
department
of
our
understanding
the
two
departments
being
recognized
in
all
languages
by
the
antithesis
of
such
words
as
and
and
etc
what
is
that
also
but
a
synthesis
a
synthesis
of
a
passive
perception
with
a
certain
tendency
to
reaction
we
are
acquainted
with
a
thing
as
soon
as
we
have
learned
how
to
behave
towards
it
or
how
to
meet
the
behavior
which
we
expect
from
it
up
to
that
point
it
is
still
to
us
if
there
be
anything
at
all
in
this
view
it
follows
that
however
vaguely
a
philosopher
may
define
the
ultimate
universal
datum
he
can
not
be
said
to
leave
it
unknown
to
us
so
long
as
he
in
the
slightest
degree
pretends
that
our
emotional
or
active
attitude
toward
it
should
be
of
one
sort
rather
than
another
he
who
says
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
however
much
he
may
speak
of
the
fundamental
mysteriousness
of
things
gives
a
distinct
definition
to
that
mysteriousness
by
ascribing
to
it
the
right
to
claim
from
us
the
particular
mood
called
seriousness
which
means
the
willingness
to
live
with
energy
though
energy
bring
pain
the
same
is
true
of
him
who
says
that
all
is
vanity
for
indefinable
as
the
predicate
may
be
it
is
clearly
something
that
permits
anaesthesia
mere
escape
from
suffering
to
be
our
rule
of
life
there
can
be
no
greater
incongruity
than
for
a
disciple
of
spencer
to
proclaim
with
one
breath
that
the
substance
of
things
is
unknowable
and
with
the
next
that
the
thought
of
it
should
inspire
us
with
awe
reverence
and
a
willingness
to
add
our
push
in
the
direction
toward
which
its
manifestations
seem
to
be
drifting
the
unknowable
may
be
unfathomed
but
if
it
make
such
distinct
demands
upon
our
activity
we
surely
are
not
ignorant
of
its
essential
quality
if
we
survey
the
field
of
history
and
ask
what
feature
all
great
periods
of
revival
of
expansion
of
the
human
mind
display
in
common
we
shall
find
i
think
simply
this
that
each
and
all
of
them
have
said
to
the
human
being
the
inmost
nature
of
the
reality
is
congenial
to
which
you
possess
in
what
did
the
emancipating
message
of
primitive
christianity
consist
but
in
the
announcement
that
god
recognizes
those
weak
and
tender
impulses
which
paganism
had
so
rudely
overlooked
take
repentance
the
man
who
can
do
nothing
rightly
can
at
least
repent
of
his
failures
but
for
paganism
this
faculty
of
repentance
was
a
pure
supernumerary
a
straggler
too
late
for
the
fair
christianity
took
it
and
made
it
the
one
power
within
us
which
appealed
straight
to
the
heart
of
god
and
after
the
night
of
the
middle
ages
had
so
long
branded
with
obloquy
even
the
generous
impulses
of
the
flesh
and
defined
the
reality
to
be
such
that
only
slavish
natures
could
commune
with
it
in
what
did
the
of
the
platonizing
renaissance
lie
but
in
the
proclamation
that
the
archetype
of
verity
in
things
laid
claim
on
the
widest
activity
of
our
whole
aesthetic
being
what
were
luther
mission
and
wesley
but
appeals
to
powers
which
even
the
meanest
of
men
might
carry
with
them
faith
and
but
which
were
personal
requiring
no
priestly
intermediation
and
which
brought
their
owner
face
to
face
with
god
what
caused
the
wildfire
influence
of
rousseau
but
the
assurance
he
gave
that
man
nature
was
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
things
if
only
the
paralyzing
corruptions
of
custom
would
stand
from
between
how
did
kant
and
fichte
goethe
and
schiller
inspire
their
time
with
cheer
except
by
saying
use
all
your
powers
that
is
the
only
obedience
the
universe
exacts
and
carlyle
with
his
gospel
of
work
of
fact
of
veracity
how
does
he
move
us
except
by
saying
that
the
universe
imposes
no
tasks
upon
us
but
such
as
the
most
humble
can
perform
emerson
creed
that
everything
that
ever
was
or
will
be
is
here
in
the
enveloping
now
that
man
has
but
to
obey
himself
he
who
will
rest
in
what
he
is
a
part
of
destiny
is
in
like
manner
nothing
but
an
exorcism
of
all
scepticism
as
to
the
pertinency
of
one
natural
faculties
in
a
word
son
of
man
upon
thy
and
i
will
speak
unto
thee
is
the
only
revelation
of
truth
to
which
the
solving
epochs
have
helped
the
disciple
but
that
has
been
enough
to
satisfy
the
greater
part
of
his
rational
need
and
the
universal
essence
has
hardly
been
more
defined
by
any
of
these
formulas
than
by
the
agnostic
but
the
mere
assurance
that
my
powers
such
as
they
are
are
not
irrelevant
to
it
but
pertinent
that
it
speaks
to
them
and
will
in
some
way
recognize
their
reply
that
i
can
be
a
match
for
it
if
i
will
and
not
a
footless
waif
suffices
to
make
it
rational
to
my
feeling
in
the
sense
given
above
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
to
hope
for
the
definitive
triumph
of
any
philosophy
which
should
refuse
to
legitimate
and
to
legitimate
in
an
emphatic
manner
the
more
powerful
of
our
emotional
and
practical
tendencies
fatalism
whose
solving
word
in
all
crises
of
behavior
is
all
striving
is
vain
will
never
reign
supreme
for
the
impulse
to
take
life
strivingly
is
indestructible
in
the
race
moral
creeds
which
speak
to
that
impulse
will
be
widely
successful
in
spite
of
inconsistency
vagueness
and
shadowy
determination
of
expectancy
man
needs
a
rule
for
his
will
and
will
invent
one
if
one
be
not
given
him
but
now
observe
a
most
important
consequence
men
active
impulses
are
so
differently
mixed
that
a
philosophy
fit
in
this
respect
for
bismarck
will
almost
certainly
be
unfit
for
a
valetudinarian
poet
in
other
words
although
one
can
lay
down
in
advance
the
rule
that
a
philosophy
which
utterly
denies
all
fundamental
ground
for
seriousness
for
effort
for
hope
which
says
the
nature
of
things
is
radically
alien
to
human
nature
can
never
succeed
one
can
not
in
advance
say
what
particular
dose
of
hope
or
of
gnosticism
of
the
nature
of
things
the
definitely
successful
philosophy
shall
contain
in
short
it
is
almost
certain
that
personal
temperament
will
here
make
itself
felt
and
that
although
all
men
will
insist
on
being
spoken
to
by
the
universe
in
some
way
few
will
insist
on
being
spoken
to
in
just
the
same
way
we
have
here
in
short
the
sphere
of
what
matthew
arnold
likes
to
call
legitimate
inexpugnable
yet
doomed
to
eternal
variations
and
disputes
take
idealism
and
materialism
as
examples
of
what
i
mean
and
suppose
for
a
moment
that
both
give
a
conception
of
equal
theoretic
clearness
and
consistency
and
that
both
determine
our
expectations
equally
well
idealism
will
be
chosen
by
a
man
of
one
emotional
constitution
materialism
by
another
at
this
very
day
all
sentimental
natures
fond
of
conciliation
and
intimacy
tend
to
an
idealistic
faith
why
because
idealism
gives
to
the
nature
of
things
such
kinship
with
our
personal
selves
our
own
thoughts
are
what
we
are
most
at
home
with
what
we
are
least
afraid
of
to
say
then
that
the
universe
essentially
is
thought
is
to
say
that
i
myself
potentially
at
least
am
all
there
is
no
radically
alien
corner
but
an
now
in
certain
sensitively
egotistic
minds
this
conception
of
reality
is
sure
to
put
on
a
narrow
close
air
everything
sentimental
and
priggish
will
be
consecrated
by
it
that
element
in
reality
which
every
strong
man
of
willingly
feels
there
because
it
calls
forth
powers
that
he
owns
the
rough
harsh
element
the
denier
of
persons
the
democratizer
is
banished
because
it
jars
too
much
on
the
desire
for
communion
now
it
is
the
very
enjoyment
of
this
element
that
throws
many
men
upon
the
materialistic
or
agnostic
hypothesis
as
a
polemic
reaction
against
the
contrary
extreme
they
sicken
at
a
life
wholly
constituted
of
intimacy
there
is
an
overpowering
desire
at
moments
to
escape
personality
to
revel
in
the
action
of
forces
that
have
no
respect
for
our
ego
to
let
the
tides
flow
even
though
they
flow
over
us
the
strife
of
these
two
kinds
of
mental
temper
will
i
think
always
be
seen
in
philosophy
some
men
will
keep
insisting
on
the
reason
the
atonement
that
lies
in
the
heart
of
things
and
that
we
can
act
others
on
the
opacity
of
brute
fact
that
we
must
react
now
there
is
one
element
of
our
active
nature
which
the
christian
religion
has
emphatically
recognized
but
which
philosophers
as
a
rule
have
with
great
insincerity
tried
to
huddle
out
of
sight
in
their
pretension
to
found
systems
of
absolute
certainty
i
mean
the
element
of
faith
faith
means
belief
in
something
concerning
which
doubt
is
still
theoretically
possible
and
as
the
test
of
belief
is
willingness
to
act
one
may
say
that
faith
is
the
readiness
to
act
in
a
cause
the
prosperous
issue
of
which
is
not
certified
to
us
in
advance
it
is
in
fact
the
same
moral
quality
which
we
call
courage
in
practical
affairs
and
there
will
be
a
very
widespread
tendency
in
men
of
vigorous
nature
to
enjoy
a
certain
amount
of
uncertainty
in
their
philosophic
creed
just
as
risk
lends
a
zest
to
worldly
activity
absolutely
certified
philosophies
seeking
the
are
fruits
of
mental
natures
in
which
the
passion
for
identity
which
we
saw
to
be
but
one
factor
of
the
rational
appetite
plays
an
abnormally
exclusive
part
in
the
average
man
on
the
contrary
the
power
to
trust
to
risk
a
little
beyond
the
literal
evidence
is
an
essential
function
any
mode
of
conceiving
the
universe
which
makes
an
appeal
to
this
generous
power
and
makes
the
man
seem
as
if
he
were
individually
helping
to
create
the
actuality
of
the
truth
whose
metaphysical
reality
he
is
willing
to
assume
will
be
sure
to
be
responded
to
by
large
numbers
the
necessity
of
faith
as
an
ingredient
in
our
mental
attitude
is
strongly
insisted
on
by
the
scientific
philosophers
of
the
present
day
but
by
a
singularly
arbitrary
caprice
they
say
that
it
is
only
legitimate
when
used
in
the
interests
of
one
particular
proposition
the
proposition
namely
that
the
course
of
nature
is
uniform
that
nature
will
follow
the
same
laws
that
she
follows
is
they
all
admit
a
truth
which
no
man
can
but
in
the
interests
of
cognition
as
well
as
of
action
we
must
postulate
or
assume
it
as
helmholtz
says
hier
gilt
nur
der
eine
rath
vertraue
und
handle
and
professor
bain
urges
our
only
error
is
in
proposing
to
give
any
reason
or
justification
of
the
postulate
or
to
treat
it
as
otherwise
than
begged
at
the
very
outset
with
regard
to
all
other
possible
truths
however
a
number
of
our
most
influential
contemporaries
think
that
an
attitude
of
faith
is
not
only
illogical
but
shameful
faith
in
a
religious
dogma
for
which
there
is
no
outward
proof
but
which
we
are
tempted
to
postulate
for
our
emotional
interests
just
as
we
postulate
the
uniformity
of
nature
for
our
intellectual
interests
is
branded
by
professor
huxley
as
the
lowest
depth
of
immorality
citations
of
this
kind
from
leaders
of
the
modern
might
be
multiplied
almost
indefinitely
take
professor
clifford
article
on
the
of
belief
he
calls
it
and
to
believe
even
the
truth
without
evidence
but
what
is
the
use
of
being
a
genius
unless
the
same
scientific
as
other
men
one
can
reach
more
truth
than
they
why
does
clifford
fearlessly
proclaim
his
belief
in
the
theory
although
the
before
him
are
the
same
which
make
lewes
reject
it
why
does
he
believe
in
primordial
units
of
on
evidence
which
would
seem
quite
worthless
to
professor
bain
simply
because
like
every
human
being
of
the
slightest
mental
originality
he
is
peculiarly
sensitive
to
evidence
that
bears
in
some
one
direction
it
is
utterly
hopeless
to
try
to
exorcise
such
sensitiveness
by
calling
it
the
disturbing
subjective
factor
and
branding
it
as
the
root
of
all
evil
be
it
called
and
to
those
whom
it
foils
but
if
it
helps
those
who
as
cicero
says
vim
naturae
magis
sentiunt
it
is
good
and
not
evil
pretend
what
we
may
the
whole
man
within
us
is
at
work
when
we
form
our
philosophical
opinions
intellect
will
taste
and
passion
just
as
they
do
in
practical
affairs
and
lucky
it
is
if
the
passion
be
not
something
as
petty
as
a
love
of
personal
conquest
over
the
philosopher
across
the
way
the
absurd
abstraction
of
an
intellect
verbally
formulating
all
its
evidence
and
carefully
estimating
the
probability
thereof
by
a
vulgar
fraction
by
the
size
of
whose
denominator
and
numerator
alone
it
is
swayed
is
ideally
as
inept
as
it
is
actually
impossible
it
is
almost
incredible
that
men
who
are
themselves
working
philosophers
should
pretend
that
any
philosophy
can
be
or
ever
has
been
constructed
without
the
help
of
personal
preference
belief
or
divination
how
have
they
succeeded
in
so
stultifying
their
sense
for
the
living
facts
of
human
nature
as
not
to
perceive
that
every
philosopher
or
man
of
science
either
whose
initiative
counts
for
anything
in
the
evolution
of
thought
has
taken
his
stand
on
a
sort
of
dumb
conviction
that
the
truth
must
lie
in
one
direction
rather
than
another
and
a
sort
of
preliminary
assurance
that
his
notion
can
be
made
to
work
and
has
borne
his
best
fruit
in
trying
to
make
it
work
these
mental
instincts
in
different
men
are
the
spontaneous
variations
upon
which
the
intellectual
struggle
for
existence
is
based
the
fittest
conceptions
survive
and
with
them
the
names
of
their
champions
shining
to
all
futurity
the
coil
is
about
us
struggle
as
we
may
the
only
escape
from
faith
is
mental
nullity
what
we
enjoy
most
in
a
huxley
or
a
clifford
is
not
the
professor
with
his
learning
but
the
human
personality
ready
to
go
in
for
what
it
feels
to
be
right
in
spite
of
all
appearances
the
concrete
man
has
but
one
interest
to
be
right
that
for
him
is
the
art
of
all
arts
and
all
means
are
fair
which
help
him
to
it
naked
he
is
flung
into
the
world
and
between
him
and
nature
there
are
no
rules
of
civilized
warfare
the
rules
of
the
scientific
game
burdens
of
proof
presumptions
complete
inductions
and
the
like
are
only
binding
on
those
who
enter
that
game
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
all
more
or
less
do
enter
it
because
it
helps
us
to
our
end
but
if
the
means
presume
to
frustrate
the
end
and
call
us
cheats
for
being
right
in
advance
of
their
slow
aid
by
guesswork
or
by
hook
or
crook
what
shall
we
say
of
them
were
all
of
clifford
works
except
the
ethics
of
belief
forgotten
he
might
well
figure
in
future
treatises
on
psychology
in
place
of
the
somewhat
threadbare
instance
of
the
miser
who
has
been
led
by
the
association
of
ideas
to
prefer
his
gold
to
all
the
goods
he
might
buy
therewith
in
short
if
i
am
born
with
such
a
superior
general
reaction
to
evidence
that
i
can
guess
right
and
act
accordingly
and
gain
all
that
comes
of
right
action
while
my
less
gifted
neighbor
paralyzed
by
his
scruples
and
waiting
for
more
evidence
which
he
dares
not
anticipate
much
as
he
longs
to
still
stands
shivering
on
the
brink
by
what
law
shall
i
be
forbidden
to
reap
the
advantages
of
my
superior
native
sensitiveness
of
course
i
yield
to
my
belief
in
such
a
case
as
this
or
distrust
it
alike
at
my
peril
just
as
i
do
in
any
of
the
great
practical
decisions
of
life
if
my
inborn
faculties
are
good
i
am
a
prophet
if
poor
i
am
a
failure
nature
spews
me
out
of
her
mouth
and
there
is
an
end
of
me
in
the
total
game
of
life
we
stake
our
persons
all
the
while
and
if
in
its
theoretic
part
our
persons
will
help
us
to
a
conclusion
surely
we
should
also
stake
them
there
however
inarticulate
they
may
be
but
in
being
myself
so
very
articulate
in
proving
what
to
all
readers
with
a
sense
for
reality
will
seem
a
platitude
am
i
not
wasting
words
we
can
not
live
or
think
at
all
without
some
degree
of
faith
faith
is
synonymous
with
working
hypothesis
the
only
difference
is
that
while
some
hypotheses
can
be
refuted
in
five
minutes
others
may
defy
ages
a
chemist
who
conjectures
that
a
certain
contains
arsenic
and
has
faith
enough
to
lead
him
to
take
the
trouble
to
put
some
of
it
into
a
hydrogen
bottle
finds
out
by
the
results
of
his
action
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
but
theories
like
that
of
darwin
or
that
of
the
kinetic
constitution
of
matter
may
exhaust
the
labors
of
generations
in
their
corroboration
each
tester
of
their
truth
proceeding
in
this
simple
way
that
he
acts
as
if
it
were
true
and
expects
the
result
to
disappoint
him
if
his
assumption
is
false
the
longer
disappointment
is
delayed
the
stronger
grows
his
faith
in
his
theory
now
in
such
questions
as
god
immortality
absolute
morality
and
no
believer
at
the
present
day
pretends
his
faith
to
be
of
an
essentially
different
complexion
he
can
always
doubt
his
creed
but
his
intimate
persuasion
is
that
the
odds
in
its
favor
are
strong
enough
to
warrant
him
in
acting
all
along
on
the
assumption
of
its
truth
his
corroboration
or
repudiation
by
the
nature
of
things
may
be
deferred
until
the
day
of
judgment
the
uttermost
he
now
means
is
something
like
this
i
then
to
triumph
with
tenfold
glory
but
if
it
should
turn
out
as
indeed
it
may
that
i
have
spent
my
days
in
a
fool
paradise
why
better
have
been
the
dupe
of
a
dreamland
than
the
cunning
reader
of
a
world
like
that
which
then
beyond
all
doubt
unmasks
itself
to
view
in
short
we
against
materialism
very
much
as
we
should
had
we
a
chance
against
the
second
french
empire
or
the
church
of
rome
or
any
other
system
of
things
toward
which
our
repugnance
is
vast
enough
to
determine
energetic
action
but
too
vague
to
issue
in
distinct
argumentation
our
reasons
are
ludicrously
incommensurate
with
the
volume
of
our
feeling
yet
on
the
latter
we
unhesitatingly
act
now
i
wish
to
show
what
to
my
knowledge
has
never
been
clearly
pointed
out
that
belief
as
measured
by
action
not
only
does
and
must
continually
outstrip
scientific
evidence
but
that
there
is
a
certain
class
of
truths
of
whose
reality
belief
is
a
factor
as
well
as
a
confessor
and
that
as
regards
this
class
of
truths
faith
is
not
only
licit
and
pertinent
but
essential
and
indispensable
the
truths
can
not
become
true
till
our
faith
has
made
them
so
suppose
for
example
that
i
am
climbing
in
the
alps
and
have
had
the
to
work
myself
into
a
position
from
which
the
only
escape
is
by
a
terrible
leap
being
without
similar
experience
i
have
no
evidence
of
my
ability
to
perform
it
successfully
but
hope
and
confidence
in
myself
make
me
sure
i
shall
not
miss
my
aim
and
nerve
my
feet
to
execute
what
without
those
subjective
emotions
would
perhaps
have
been
impossible
but
suppose
that
on
the
contrary
the
emotions
of
fear
and
mistrust
preponderate
or
suppose
that
having
just
read
the
ethics
of
belief
i
feel
it
would
be
sinful
to
act
upon
an
assumption
unverified
by
previous
experience
why
then
i
shall
hesitate
so
long
that
at
last
exhausted
and
trembling
and
launching
myself
in
a
moment
of
despair
i
miss
my
foothold
and
roll
into
the
abyss
in
this
case
and
it
is
one
of
an
immense
class
the
part
of
wisdom
clearly
is
to
believe
what
one
desires
for
the
belief
is
one
of
the
indispensable
preliminary
conditions
of
the
realization
of
its
object
are
then
cases
where
faith
creates
its
own
believe
and
you
shall
be
right
for
you
shall
save
yourself
doubt
and
you
shall
again
be
right
for
you
shall
perish
the
only
difference
is
that
to
believe
is
greatly
to
your
advantage
the
future
movements
of
the
stars
or
the
facts
of
past
history
are
determined
now
once
for
all
whether
i
like
them
or
not
they
are
given
irrespective
of
my
wishes
and
in
all
that
concerns
truths
like
these
subjective
preference
should
have
no
part
it
can
only
obscure
the
judgment
but
in
every
fact
into
which
there
enters
an
element
of
personal
contribution
on
my
part
as
soon
as
this
personal
contribution
demands
a
certain
degree
of
subjective
energy
which
in
its
turn
calls
for
a
certain
amount
of
faith
in
the
result
so
that
after
all
the
future
fact
is
conditioned
by
my
present
faith
in
it
how
trebly
asinine
would
it
be
for
me
to
deny
myself
the
use
of
the
subjective
method
the
method
of
belief
based
on
desire
in
every
proposition
whose
bearing
is
universal
and
such
are
all
the
propositions
of
philosophy
the
acts
of
the
subject
and
their
consequences
throughout
eternity
should
be
included
in
the
formula
if
represent
the
entire
world
the
reaction
of
the
thinker
upon
it
and
if
represent
the
absolutely
total
matter
of
philosophic
propositions
standing
for
the
thinker
reaction
and
its
results
what
would
be
a
universal
truth
if
the
term
x
were
of
one
complexion
might
become
egregious
error
if
altered
its
character
let
it
not
be
said
that
is
too
infinitesimal
a
component
to
change
the
character
of
the
immense
whole
in
which
it
lies
imbedded
everything
depends
on
the
point
of
view
of
the
philosophic
proposition
in
question
if
we
have
to
define
the
universe
from
the
point
of
view
of
sensibility
the
critical
material
for
our
judgment
lies
in
the
animal
kingdom
insignificant
as
that
is
quantitatively
considered
the
moral
definition
of
the
world
may
depend
on
phenomena
more
restricted
still
in
range
in
short
many
a
long
phrase
may
have
its
sense
reversed
by
the
addition
of
three
letters
many
a
monstrous
mass
have
its
unstable
equilibrium
discharged
one
way
or
the
other
by
a
feather
weight
that
falls
let
us
make
this
clear
by
a
few
examples
the
philosophy
of
evolution
offers
us
a
new
criterion
to
serve
as
an
ethical
test
between
right
and
wrong
previous
criteria
it
says
being
subjective
have
left
us
still
floundering
in
variations
of
opinion
and
the
here
is
a
criterion
which
is
objective
and
fixed
is
to
be
called
good
which
is
destined
to
prevail
or
but
we
immediately
see
that
this
standard
can
only
remain
objective
by
leaving
myself
and
my
conduct
out
if
what
prevails
and
survives
does
so
by
my
help
and
can
not
do
so
without
that
help
if
something
else
will
prevail
in
case
i
alter
my
conduct
how
can
i
possibly
now
conscious
of
alternative
courses
of
action
open
before
me
either
of
which
i
may
suppose
capable
of
altering
the
path
of
events
decide
which
course
to
take
by
asking
what
path
events
will
follow
if
they
follow
my
direction
evidently
my
direction
can
not
wait
on
them
the
only
possible
manner
in
which
an
evolutionist
can
use
his
standard
is
the
obsequious
method
of
forecasting
the
course
society
would
take
for
and
then
putting
an
extinguisher
on
all
personal
idiosyncrasies
of
desire
and
interest
and
with
bated
breath
and
tiptoe
tread
following
as
straight
as
may
be
at
the
tail
and
bringing
up
the
rear
of
everything
some
pious
creatures
may
find
a
pleasure
in
this
but
not
only
does
it
violate
our
general
wish
to
lead
and
not
to
follow
a
wish
which
is
surely
not
immoral
if
we
but
lead
aright
but
if
it
be
treated
as
every
ethical
principle
must
be
treated
namely
as
a
rule
good
for
all
men
alike
its
general
observance
would
lead
to
its
practical
refutation
by
bringing
about
a
general
deadlock
each
good
man
hanging
back
and
waiting
for
orders
from
the
rest
absolute
stagnation
would
ensue
happy
then
if
a
few
unrighteous
ones
contribute
an
initiative
which
sets
things
moving
again
all
this
is
no
caricature
that
the
course
of
destiny
may
be
altered
by
individuals
no
wise
evolutionist
ought
to
doubt
everything
for
him
has
small
beginnings
has
a
bud
which
may
be
and
nipped
by
a
feeble
force
human
races
and
tendencies
follow
the
law
and
have
also
small
beginnings
the
best
according
to
evolution
is
that
which
has
the
biggest
endings
now
if
a
present
race
of
men
enlightened
in
the
evolutionary
philosophy
and
able
to
forecast
the
future
were
able
to
discern
in
a
tribe
arising
near
them
the
potentiality
of
future
supremacy
were
able
to
see
that
their
own
race
would
eventually
be
wiped
out
of
existence
by
the
if
the
expansion
of
these
were
left
unmolested
these
present
sages
would
have
two
courses
open
to
them
either
perfectly
in
harmony
with
the
evolutionary
test
strangle
the
new
race
now
and
ours
survives
help
the
new
race
and
it
survives
in
both
cases
the
action
is
right
as
measured
by
the
evolutionary
standard
it
is
action
for
the
winning
side
thus
the
evolutionist
foundation
of
ethics
is
purely
objective
only
to
the
herd
of
nullities
whose
votes
count
for
zero
in
the
march
of
events
but
for
others
leaders
of
opinion
or
potentates
and
in
general
those
to
whose
actions
position
or
genius
gives
a
import
and
to
the
rest
of
us
each
in
his
measure
whenever
we
espouse
a
cause
we
contribute
to
the
determination
of
the
evolutionary
standard
of
right
the
truly
wise
disciple
of
this
school
will
then
admit
faith
as
an
ultimate
ethical
factor
any
philosophy
which
makes
such
questions
as
what
is
the
ideal
type
of
humanity
what
shall
be
reckoned
virtues
what
conduct
is
good
depend
on
the
question
what
is
going
to
succeed
must
needs
fall
back
on
personal
belief
as
one
of
the
ultimate
conditions
of
the
truth
for
again
and
again
success
depends
on
energy
of
act
energy
again
depends
on
faith
that
we
shall
not
fail
and
that
faith
in
turn
on
the
faith
that
we
are
right
which
faith
thus
verifies
itself
take
as
an
example
the
question
of
optimism
or
pessimism
which
makes
so
much
noise
just
now
in
germany
every
human
being
must
sometime
decide
for
himself
whether
life
is
worth
living
suppose
that
in
looking
at
the
world
and
seeing
how
full
it
is
of
misery
of
old
age
of
wickedness
and
pain
and
how
unsafe
is
his
own
future
he
yields
to
the
pessimistic
conclusion
cultivates
disgust
and
dread
ceases
striving
and
finally
commits
suicide
he
thus
adds
to
the
mass
of
mundane
phenomena
independent
of
his
subjectivity
the
subjective
complement
which
makes
of
the
whole
an
utterly
black
picture
illumined
by
no
gleam
of
good
pessimism
completed
verified
by
his
moral
reaction
and
the
deed
in
which
this
ends
is
true
beyond
a
doubt
expresses
a
state
of
things
totally
bad
the
belief
supplied
all
that
was
lacking
to
make
it
so
and
now
that
it
is
made
so
the
belief
was
right
but
now
suppose
that
with
the
same
evil
facts
the
man
reaction
is
exactly
reversed
suppose
that
instead
of
giving
way
to
the
evil
he
braves
it
and
finds
a
sterner
more
wonderful
joy
than
any
passive
pleasure
can
yield
in
triumphing
over
pain
and
defying
fear
suppose
he
does
this
successfully
and
however
thickly
evils
crowd
upon
him
proves
his
dauntless
subjectivity
to
be
more
than
their
match
will
not
every
one
confess
that
the
bad
character
of
the
is
here
the
sine
qua
of
the
good
character
of
the
will
not
every
one
instantly
declare
a
world
fitted
only
for
human
beings
susceptible
of
every
passive
enjoyment
but
without
independence
courage
or
fortitude
to
be
from
a
moral
point
of
view
incommensurably
inferior
to
a
world
framed
to
elicit
from
the
man
every
form
of
triumphant
endurance
and
conquering
moral
energy
as
james
hinton
says
little
inconveniences
exertions
these
are
the
only
things
in
which
we
rightly
feel
our
life
at
all
if
these
be
not
there
existence
becomes
worthless
or
worse
success
in
putting
them
all
away
is
fatal
so
it
is
men
engage
in
athletic
sports
spend
their
holidays
in
climbing
up
mountains
find
nothing
so
enjoyable
as
that
which
taxes
their
endurance
and
their
energy
this
is
the
way
we
are
made
i
say
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
mystery
or
a
paradox
it
is
a
fact
now
this
enjoyment
in
endurance
is
just
according
to
the
intensity
of
life
the
more
physical
vigor
and
balance
the
more
endurance
can
be
made
an
element
of
satisfaction
a
sick
man
can
not
stand
it
the
line
of
enjoyable
suffering
is
not
a
fixed
one
it
fluctuates
with
the
perfectness
of
the
life
that
our
pains
are
as
they
are
unendurable
awful
overwhelming
crushing
not
to
be
borne
save
in
misery
and
dumb
impatience
which
utter
exhaustion
alone
makes
patient
that
our
pains
are
thus
unendurable
means
not
that
they
are
too
great
but
that
are
we
have
not
got
our
proper
life
so
you
perceive
pain
is
no
more
necessarily
an
evil
but
an
essential
element
of
the
highest
good
but
the
highest
good
can
be
achieved
only
by
our
getting
our
proper
life
and
that
can
come
about
only
by
help
of
a
moral
energy
born
of
the
faith
that
in
some
way
or
other
we
shall
succeed
in
getting
it
if
we
try
pertinaciously
enough
this
world
good
we
must
say
since
it
is
what
we
make
it
and
we
shall
make
it
good
how
can
we
exclude
from
the
cognition
of
a
truth
a
faith
which
is
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
truth
has
its
character
indeterminate
susceptible
of
forming
part
of
a
pessimism
on
the
one
hand
or
of
a
meliorism
a
moral
as
distinguished
from
a
sensual
optimism
on
the
other
all
depends
on
the
character
of
the
personal
contribution
wherever
the
facts
to
be
formulated
contain
such
a
contribution
we
may
logically
legitimately
and
inexpugnably
believe
what
we
desire
the
belief
creates
its
verification
the
thought
becomes
literally
father
to
the
fact
as
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
let
us
now
turn
to
the
radical
question
of
life
the
question
whether
this
be
at
bottom
a
moral
or
an
unmoral
universe
and
see
whether
the
method
of
faith
may
legitimately
have
a
place
there
it
is
really
the
question
of
materialism
is
the
world
a
simple
brute
actuality
an
existence
about
which
the
deepest
thing
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
happens
so
to
be
or
is
the
judgment
of
or
worse
of
as
intimately
pertinent
to
phenomena
as
the
simple
judgment
or
the
materialistic
theorists
say
that
judgments
of
worth
are
themselves
mere
matters
of
fact
that
the
words
and
have
no
sense
apart
from
subjective
passions
and
interests
which
we
may
if
we
please
play
fast
and
loose
with
at
will
so
far
as
any
duty
of
ours
to
the
universe
is
concerned
thus
when
a
materialist
says
it
is
better
for
him
to
suffer
great
inconvenience
than
to
break
a
promise
he
only
means
that
his
social
interests
have
become
so
knit
up
with
keeping
faith
that
those
interests
once
being
granted
it
is
better
for
him
to
keep
the
promise
in
spite
of
everything
but
the
interests
themselves
are
neither
right
nor
wrong
except
possibly
with
reference
to
some
ulterior
order
of
interests
which
themselves
again
are
mere
subjective
data
without
character
either
good
or
bad
for
the
absolute
moralists
on
the
contrary
the
interests
are
not
there
merely
to
be
felt
they
are
to
be
believed
in
and
obeyed
not
only
is
it
best
for
my
social
interests
to
keep
my
promise
but
best
for
me
to
have
those
interests
and
best
for
the
cosmos
to
have
this
me
like
the
old
woman
in
the
story
who
described
the
world
as
resting
on
a
rock
and
then
explained
that
rock
to
be
supported
by
another
rock
and
finally
when
pushed
with
questions
said
it
was
rocks
all
the
way
down
he
who
believes
this
to
be
a
radically
moral
universe
must
hold
the
moral
order
to
rest
either
on
an
absolute
and
ultimate
or
on
a
series
of
all
the
way
down
the
practical
difference
between
this
objective
sort
of
moralist
and
the
other
one
is
enormous
the
subjectivist
in
morals
when
his
moral
feelings
are
at
war
with
the
facts
about
him
is
always
free
to
seek
harmony
by
toning
down
the
sensitiveness
of
the
feelings
being
mere
data
neither
good
nor
evil
in
themselves
he
may
pervert
them
or
lull
them
to
sleep
by
any
means
at
his
command
truckling
compromise
capitulations
of
conscience
are
conventionally
opprobrious
names
for
what
if
successfully
carried
out
would
be
on
his
principles
by
far
the
easiest
and
most
praiseworthy
mode
of
bringing
about
that
harmony
between
inner
and
outer
relations
which
is
all
that
he
means
by
good
the
absolute
moralist
on
the
other
hand
when
his
interests
clash
with
the
world
is
not
free
to
gain
harmony
by
sacrificing
the
ideal
interests
according
to
him
these
latter
should
be
as
they
are
and
not
otherwise
resistance
then
poverty
martyrdom
if
need
be
tragedy
in
a
word
such
are
the
solemn
feasts
of
his
inward
faith
not
that
the
contradiction
between
the
two
men
occurs
every
day
in
commonplace
matters
all
moral
schools
agree
it
is
only
in
the
lonely
emergencies
of
life
that
our
creed
is
tested
then
routine
maxims
fail
and
we
fall
back
on
our
gods
it
can
not
then
be
said
that
the
question
is
this
a
moral
world
is
a
meaningless
and
unverifiable
question
because
it
deals
with
something
any
question
is
full
of
meaning
to
which
as
here
contrary
answers
lead
to
contrary
behavior
and
it
seems
as
if
in
answering
such
a
question
as
this
we
might
proceed
exactly
as
does
the
physical
philosopher
in
testing
an
hypothesis
he
deduces
from
the
hypothesis
an
experimental
action
this
he
adds
to
the
facts
already
existing
it
fits
them
if
the
hypothesis
be
true
if
not
there
is
discord
the
results
of
the
action
corroborate
or
refute
the
idea
from
which
it
flowed
so
here
the
verification
of
the
theory
which
you
may
hold
as
to
the
objectively
moral
character
of
the
world
can
consist
only
in
this
that
if
you
proceed
to
act
upon
your
theory
it
will
be
reversed
by
nothing
that
later
turns
up
as
your
action
fruit
it
will
harmonize
so
well
with
the
entire
drift
of
experience
that
the
latter
will
as
it
were
adopt
it
or
at
most
give
it
an
ampler
interpretation
without
obliging
you
in
any
way
to
change
the
essence
of
its
formulation
if
this
be
an
objectively
moral
universe
all
acts
that
i
make
on
that
assumption
all
expectations
that
i
ground
on
it
will
tend
more
and
more
completely
to
interdigitate
with
the
phenomena
already
existing
will
be
in
accord
and
the
more
i
live
and
the
more
the
fruits
of
my
activity
come
to
light
the
more
satisfactory
the
consensus
will
grow
while
if
it
be
not
such
a
moral
universe
and
i
mistakenly
assume
that
it
is
the
course
of
experience
will
throw
ever
new
impediments
in
the
way
of
my
belief
and
become
more
and
more
difficult
to
express
in
its
language
epicycle
upon
epicycle
of
subsidiary
hypothesis
will
have
to
be
invoked
to
give
to
the
discrepant
terms
a
temporary
appearance
of
squaring
with
each
other
but
at
last
even
this
resource
will
fail
if
on
the
other
hand
i
rightly
assume
the
universe
to
be
not
moral
in
what
does
my
verification
consist
it
is
that
by
letting
moral
interests
sit
lightly
by
disbelieving
that
there
is
any
duty
about
since
duty
obtains
only
as
them
and
other
phenomena
and
so
throwing
them
over
if
i
find
it
hard
to
get
them
satisfied
it
is
that
by
refusing
to
take
up
a
tragic
attitude
i
deal
in
the
most
satisfactorily
with
the
facts
of
life
all
is
vanity
is
here
the
last
word
of
wisdom
even
though
in
certain
limited
series
there
may
be
a
great
appearance
of
seriousness
he
who
in
the
main
treats
things
with
a
degree
of
scepticism
and
radical
levity
will
find
that
the
practical
fruits
of
his
epicurean
hypothesis
verify
it
more
and
more
and
not
only
save
him
from
pain
but
do
honor
to
his
sagacity
while
on
the
other
hand
he
who
contrary
to
reality
stiffens
himself
in
the
notion
that
certain
things
absolutely
should
be
and
rejects
the
truth
that
at
bottom
it
makes
no
difference
what
is
will
find
himself
evermore
thwarted
and
perplexed
and
bemuddled
by
the
facts
of
the
world
and
his
tragic
disappointment
will
as
experience
accumulates
seem
to
drift
farther
and
farther
away
from
that
final
atonement
or
reconciliation
which
certain
partial
tragedies
often
get
is
the
watchword
of
the
moral
sceptic
brought
to
bay
and
put
to
his
trumps
is
that
of
the
moralist
act
on
my
creed
cries
the
latter
and
the
results
of
your
action
will
prove
the
creed
true
and
that
the
nature
of
things
is
earnest
infinitely
act
on
mine
says
the
epicurean
and
the
results
will
prove
that
seriousness
is
but
a
superficial
glaze
upon
a
world
of
fundamentally
trivial
import
you
and
your
acts
and
the
nature
of
things
will
be
alike
enveloped
in
a
single
formula
a
universal
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
i
have
written
as
if
the
verification
might
occur
in
the
life
of
a
single
philosopher
which
is
manifestly
untrue
since
the
theories
still
face
each
other
and
the
facts
of
the
world
give
countenance
to
both
rather
should
we
expect
that
in
a
question
of
this
scope
the
experience
of
the
entire
human
race
must
make
the
verification
and
that
all
the
evidence
will
not
be
till
the
final
integration
of
things
when
the
last
man
has
had
his
say
and
contributed
his
share
to
the
still
unfinished
then
the
proof
will
be
complete
then
it
will
appear
without
doubt
whether
the
moralistic
x
has
filled
up
the
gap
which
alone
kept
the
of
the
world
from
forming
an
even
and
harmonious
unity
or
whether
the
has
given
the
finishing
touches
which
were
alone
needed
to
make
the
appear
outwardly
as
vain
as
it
inwardly
was
but
if
this
be
so
is
it
not
clear
that
the
facts
taken
are
inadequate
to
justify
a
conclusion
either
way
in
advance
of
my
action
my
action
is
the
complement
which
by
proving
congruous
or
not
reveals
the
latent
nature
of
the
mass
to
which
it
is
applied
the
world
may
in
fact
be
likened
unto
a
lock
whose
inward
nature
moral
or
unmoral
will
never
reveal
itself
to
our
simply
expectant
gaze
the
positivists
forbidding
us
to
make
any
assumptions
regarding
it
condemn
us
to
eternal
ignorance
for
the
which
they
wait
for
can
never
come
so
long
as
we
are
passive
but
nature
has
put
into
our
hands
two
keys
by
which
we
may
test
the
lock
if
we
try
the
moral
key
it
it
is
a
moral
lock
if
we
try
the
unmoral
key
and
fits
it
is
an
unmoral
lock
i
can
not
possibly
conceive
of
any
other
sort
of
or
than
this
it
is
quite
true
that
the
of
generations
is
needed
to
educe
it
but
in
these
matters
the
solidarity
so
called
of
the
human
race
is
a
patent
fact
the
essential
thing
to
notice
is
that
our
active
preference
is
a
legitimate
part
of
the
game
that
it
is
our
plain
business
as
men
to
try
one
of
the
keys
and
the
one
in
which
we
most
confide
if
then
the
proof
exist
not
till
i
have
acted
and
i
must
needs
in
acting
run
the
risk
of
being
wrong
how
can
the
popular
science
professors
be
right
in
objurgating
in
me
as
infamous
a
which
the
strict
logic
of
the
situation
requires
if
this
really
be
a
moral
universe
if
by
my
acts
i
be
a
factor
of
its
destinies
if
to
believe
where
i
may
doubt
be
itself
a
moral
act
analogous
to
voting
for
a
side
not
yet
sure
to
win
by
what
right
shall
they
close
in
upon
me
and
steadily
negate
the
deepest
conceivable
function
of
my
being
by
their
preposterous
command
that
i
shall
stir
neither
hand
nor
foot
but
remain
balancing
myself
in
eternal
and
insoluble
doubt
why
doubt
itself
is
a
decision
of
the
widest
practical
reach
if
only
because
we
may
miss
by
doubting
what
goods
we
might
be
gaining
by
espousing
the
winning
side
but
more
than
that
it
is
often
practically
impossible
to
distinguish
doubt
from
dogmatic
negation
if
i
refuse
to
stop
a
murder
because
i
am
in
doubt
whether
it
be
not
justifiable
homicide
i
am
virtually
abetting
the
crime
if
i
refuse
to
bale
out
a
boat
because
i
am
in
doubt
whether
my
efforts
will
keep
her
afloat
i
am
really
helping
to
sink
her
if
in
the
mountain
precipice
i
doubt
my
right
to
risk
a
leap
i
actively
connive
at
my
destruction
he
who
commands
himself
not
to
be
credulous
of
god
of
duty
of
freedom
of
immortality
may
again
and
again
be
indistinguishable
from
him
who
dogmatically
denies
them
scepticism
in
moral
matters
is
an
active
ally
of
immorality
who
is
not
for
is
against
the
universe
will
have
no
neutrals
in
these
questions
in
theory
as
in
practice
dodge
or
hedge
or
talk
as
we
like
about
a
wise
scepticism
we
are
really
doing
volunteer
military
service
for
one
side
or
the
other
yet
obvious
as
this
necessity
practically
is
thousands
of
innocent
magazine
readers
lie
paralyzed
and
terrified
in
the
network
of
shallow
negations
which
the
leaders
of
opinion
have
thrown
over
their
souls
all
they
need
to
be
free
and
hearty
again
in
the
exercise
of
their
birthright
is
that
these
fastidious
vetoes
should
be
swept
away
all
that
the
human
heart
wants
is
its
chance
it
will
willingly
forego
certainty
in
universal
matters
if
only
it
can
be
allowed
to
feel
that
in
them
it
has
that
same
inalienable
right
to
run
risks
which
no
one
dreams
of
refusing
to
it
in
the
pettiest
practical
affairs
and
if
i
in
these
last
pages
like
the
mouse
in
the
fable
have
gnawed
a
few
of
the
strings
of
the
sophistical
net
that
has
been
binding
down
its
i
shall
be
more
than
rewarded
for
my
pains
to
sum
up
no
philosophy
will
permanently
be
deemed
rational
by
all
men
which
in
addition
to
meeting
logical
demands
does
not
to
some
degree
pretend
to
determine
expectancy
and
in
a
still
greater
degree
make
a
direct
appeal
to
all
those
powers
of
our
nature
which
we
hold
in
highest
esteem
faith
being
one
of
these
powers
will
always
remain
a
factor
not
to
be
banished
from
philosophic
constructions
the
more
so
since
in
many
ways
it
brings
forth
its
own
verification
in
these
points
then
it
is
hopeless
to
look
for
literal
agreement
among
mankind
the
ultimate
philosophy
we
may
therefore
conclude
must
not
be
too
in
form
must
not
in
all
its
parts
divide
heresy
from
orthodoxy
by
too
sharp
a
line
there
must
be
left
over
and
above
the
propositions
to
be
subscribed
semper
et
ab
another
realm
into
which
the
stifled
soul
may
escape
from
pedantic
scruples
and
indulge
its
own
faith
at
its
own
risks
and
all
that
can
here
be
done
will
be
to
mark
out
distinctly
the
questions
which
fall
within
sphere
this
essay
as
far
as
page
consists
of
extracts
from
an
article
printed
in
mind
for
july
thereafter
it
is
a
reprint
of
an
address
to
the
harvard
philosophical
club
delivered
in
and
published
in
the
princeton
review
july
at
most
the
command
laid
upon
us
by
science
to
believe
nothing
not
yet
verified
by
the
senses
is
a
prudential
rule
intended
to
maximize
our
right
thinking
and
minimize
our
errors
the
long
in
the
particular
instance
we
must
frequently
lose
truth
by
obeying
it
but
on
the
whole
we
are
safer
if
we
follow
it
consistently
for
we
are
sure
to
cover
our
losses
with
our
gains
it
is
like
those
gambling
and
insurance
rules
based
on
probability
in
which
we
secure
ourselves
against
losses
in
detail
by
hedging
on
the
total
run
but
this
hedging
philosophy
requires
that
long
run
should
be
there
and
this
makes
it
inapplicable
to
the
question
of
religious
faith
as
the
latter
comes
home
to
the
individual
man
he
plays
the
game
of
life
not
to
escape
losses
for
he
brings
nothing
with
him
to
lose
he
plays
it
for
gains
and
it
is
now
or
never
with
him
for
the
long
run
which
exists
indeed
for
humanity
is
not
there
for
him
let
him
doubt
believe
or
deny
he
runs
his
risk
and
has
the
natural
right
to
choose
which
one
it
shall
be

also
the
excellent
chapter
on

and

in
the

by

hinton
mystery
of
pain
will
undoubtedly
always
remain
the
classical
utterance
on
this
subject
observe
that
in
all
this
not
a
word
has
been
said
of
it
all
applies
as
well
to
a
predetermined
as
to
an
indeterminate
universe
if
is
fixed
in
advance
the
belief
which
leads
to
and
the
desire
which
prompts
the
belief
are
also
fixed
but
fixed
or
not
these
subjective
states
form
a
phenomenal
condition
necessarily
preceding
the
facts
necessarily
constitutive
therefore
of
the
truth
which
we
seek
if
however
free
acts
be
possible
a
faith
in
their
possibility
by
augmenting
the
moral
energy
which
gives
them
birth
will
increase
their
frequency

a
given
individual
in
either
case
as
a
later
essay
explains
see
the
which
the
moralist
regards
as
binding
upon
him
must
be
rooted
in
the
feeling
of

let
me
confess
to
the
diffidence
with
which
i
find
myself
standing
here
when
the
invitation
of
your
committee
reached
me
last
fall
the
simple
truth
is
that
i
accepted
it
as
most
men
accept
a
challenge
not
because
they
wish
to
fight
but
because
they
are
ashamed
to
say
no
pretending
in
my
small
sphere
to
be
a
teacher
i
felt
it
would
be
cowardly
to
shrink
from
the
keenest
ordeal
to
which
a
teacher
can
be
exposed
the
ordeal
of
teaching
other
teachers
fortunately
the
trial
will
last
but
one
short
hour
and
i
have
the
consolation
of
remembering
goethe
verses
vor
den
wissenden
sich
stellen
sicher
ist
in
allen
f√§llen
for
if
experts
are
the
hardest
people
to
satisfy
they
have
at
any
rate
the
liveliest
sense
of
the
difficulties
of
one
task
and
they
know
quickest
when
one
hits
the
mark
since
it
was
as
a
teacher
of
physiology
that
i
was
most
unworthily
officiating
when
your
committee
invitation
reached
me
i
must
suppose
it
to
be
for
the
sake
of
bringing
a
puff
of
the
latest
winds
of
doctrine
which
blow
over
that
somewhat
restless
sea
that
my
presence
is
desired
among
all
the
healthy
symptoms
that
characterize
this
age
i
know
no
sounder
one
than
the
eagerness
which
theologians
show
to
assimilate
results
of
science
and
to
hearken
to
the
conclusions
of
men
of
science
about
universal
matters
one
runs
a
better
chance
of
being
listened
to
if
one
can
quote
darwin
and
helmholtz
than
if
one
can
only
quote
schleiermacher
or
coleridge
i
almost
feel
myself
this
moment
that
were
i
to
produce
a
frog
and
put
him
through
his
physiological
performances
in
a
masterly
manner
before
your
eyes
i
should
gain
more
reverential
ears
for
what
i
have
to
say
during
the
remainder
of
the
hour
i
will
not
ask
whether
there
be
not
something
of
mere
fashion
in
this
prestige
which
the
words
of
the
physiologists
enjoy
just
now
if
it
be
a
fashion
it
is
certainly
a
beneficial
one
upon
the
whole
and
to
challenge
it
would
come
with
a
poor
grace
from
one
who
at
the
moment
he
speaks
is
so
conspicuously
profiting
by
its
favors
i
will
therefore
only
say
this
that
the
latest
breeze
from
the
physiological
horizon
need
not
necessarily
be
the
most
important
one
of
the
immense
amount
of
work
which
the
laboratories
of
europe
and
america
and
one
may
add
of
asia
and
australia
are
producing
every
year
much
is
destined
to
speedy
refutation
and
of
more
it
may
be
said
that
its
interest
is
purely
technical
and
not
in
any
degree
philosophical
or
universal
this
being
the
case
i
know
you
will
justify
me
if
i
fall
back
on
a
doctrine
which
is
fundamental
and
well
established
rather
than
novel
and
ask
you
whether
by
taking
counsel
together
we
may
not
trace
some
new
consequences
from
it
which
shall
interest
us
all
alike
as
men
i
refer
to
the
doctrine
of
reflex
action
especially
as
extended
to
the
brain
this
is
of
course
so
familiar
to
you
that
i
hardly
need
define
it
in
a
general
way
all
educated
people
know
what
reflex
action
means
it
means
that
the
acts
we
perform
are
always
the
result
of
outward
discharges
from
the
nervous
centres
and
that
these
outward
discharges
are
themselves
the
result
of
impressions
from
the
external
world
carried
in
along
one
or
another
of
our
sensory
nerves
applied
at
first
to
only
a
portion
of
our
acts
this
conception
has
ended
by
being
generalized
more
and
more
so
that
now
most
physiologists
tell
us
that
every
action
whatever
even
the
most
deliberately
weighed
and
calculated
does
so
far
as
its
organic
conditions
go
follow
the
reflex
type
there
is
not
one
which
can
not
be
remotely
if
not
immediately
traced
to
an
origin
in
some
incoming
impression
of
sense
there
is
no
impression
of
sense
which
unless
inhibited
by
some
other
stronger
one
does
not
immediately
or
remotely
express
itself
in
action
of
some
kind
there
is
no
one
of
those
complicated
performances
in
the
convolutions
of
the
brain
to
which
our
trains
of
thought
correspond
which
is
not
a
mere
middle
term
interposed
between
an
incoming
sensation
that
arouses
it
and
an
outgoing
discharge
of
some
sort
inhibitory
if
not
exciting
to
which
itself
gives
rise
the
structural
unit
of
the
nervous
system
is
in
fact
a
triad
neither
of
whose
elements
has
any
independent
existence
the
sensory
impression
exists
only
for
the
sake
of
awaking
the
central
process
of
reflection
and
the
central
process
of
reflection
exists
only
for
the
sake
of
calling
forth
the
final
act
all
action
is
thus
upon
the
outer
world
and
the
middle
stage
of
consideration
or
contemplation
or
thinking
is
only
a
place
of
transit
the
bottom
of
a
loop
both
whose
ends
have
their
point
of
application
in
the
outer
world
if
it
should
ever
have
no
roots
in
the
outer
world
if
it
should
ever
happen
that
it
led
to
no
active
measures
it
would
fail
of
its
essential
function
and
would
have
to
be
considered
either
pathological
or
abortive
the
current
of
life
which
runs
in
at
our
eyes
or
ears
is
meant
to
run
out
at
our
hands
feet
or
lips
the
only
use
of
the
thoughts
it
occasions
while
inside
is
to
determine
its
direction
to
whichever
of
these
organs
shall
on
the
whole
under
the
circumstances
actually
present
act
in
the
way
most
propitious
to
our
welfare
the
willing
department
of
our
nature
in
short
dominates
both
the
conceiving
department
and
the
feeling
department
or
in
plainer
english
perception
and
thinking
are
only
there
for
behavior
sake
i
am
sure
i
am
not
wrong
in
stating
this
result
as
one
of
the
fundamental
conclusions
to
which
the
entire
drift
of
modern
physiological
investigation
sweeps
us
if
asked
what
great
contribution
physiology
has
made
to
psychology
of
late
years
i
am
sure
every
competent
authority
will
reply
that
her
influence
has
in
no
way
been
so
weighty
as
in
the
copious
illustration
verification
and
consolidation
of
this
broad
general
point
of
view
i
invite
you
then
to
consider
what
may
be
the
possible
speculative
consequences
involved
in
this
great
achievement
of
our
generation
already
it
dominates
all
the
new
work
done
in
psychology
but
what
i
wish
to
ask
is
whether
its
influence
may
not
extend
far
beyond
the
limits
of
psychology
even
into
those
of
theology
herself
the
relations
of
the
doctrine
of
reflex
action
with
no
less
a
matter
than
the
doctrine
of
theism
is
in
fact
the
topic
to
which
i
now
invite
your
attention
we
are
not
the
first
in
the
field
there
have
not
been
wanting
writers
enough
to
say
that
reflex
action
and
all
that
follows
from
it
give
the
de
to
the
superstition
of
a
god
if
you
open
for
instance
such
a
book
on
comparative
psychology
as
der
thierische
wille
of
schneider
you
will
find
sandwiched
in
among
the
admirable
dealings
of
the
author
with
his
proper
subject
and
popping
out
upon
us
in
unexpected
places
the
most
delightfully
german
onslaughts
on
the
degradation
of
theologians
and
the
utter
incompatibility
of
so
many
reflex
adaptations
to
the
environment
with
the
existence
of
a
creative
intelligence
there
was
a
time
remembered
by
many
of
us
here
when
the
existence
of
reflex
action
and
all
the
other
harmonies
between
the
organism
and
the
world
were
held
to
prove
a
god
now
they
are
held
to
disprove
him
the
next
turn
of
the
whirligig
may
bring
back
proof
of
him
again
into
this
debate
about
his
existence
i
will
not
pretend
to
enter
i
must
take
up
humbler
ground
and
limit
my
ambition
to
showing
that
a
god
whether
existent
or
not
is
at
all
events
the
kind
of
being
which
if
he
did
exist
would
form
most
adequate
possible
for
minds
framed
like
our
own
to
conceive
as
lying
at
the
root
of
the
universe
my
thesis
in
other
words
is
this
that
some
outward
reality
of
a
nature
defined
as
god
nature
must
be
defined
is
the
only
ultimate
object
that
is
at
the
same
time
rational
and
possible
for
the
human
mind
contemplation
short
of
god
is
not
rational
anything
more
than
god
is
not
if
the
human
mind
be
in
truth
the
triadic
structure
of
impression
reflection
and
reaction
which
we
at
the
outset
allowed
theism
whatever
its
objective
warrant
would
thus
be
seen
to
have
a
subjective
anchorage
in
its
congruity
with
our
nature
as
thinkers
and
however
it
may
fare
with
its
truth
to
derive
from
this
subjective
adequacy
the
strongest
possible
guaranty
of
its
permanence
it
is
and
will
be
the
classic
mean
of
rational
opinion
the
centre
of
gravity
of
all
attempts
to
solve
the
riddle
of
life
some
falling
below
it
by
defect
some
flying
above
it
by
excess
itself
alone
satisfying
every
mental
need
in
strictly
normal
measure
our
gain
will
thus
in
the
first
instance
be
psychological
we
shall
merely
have
investigated
a
chapter
in
the
natural
history
of
the
mind
and
found
that
as
a
matter
of
such
natural
history
god
may
be
called
the
normal
object
of
the
mind
belief
whether
over
and
above
this
he
be
really
the
living
truth
is
another
question
if
he
is
it
will
show
the
structure
of
our
mind
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
reality
whether
it
be
or
not
in
such
accordance
is
it
seems
to
me
one
of
those
questions
that
belong
to
the
province
of
personal
faith
to
decide
i
will
not
touch
upon
the
question
here
for
i
prefer
to
keep
to
the
strictly
point
of
view
i
will
only
remind
you
that
each
one
of
us
is
entitled
either
to
doubt
or
to
believe
in
the
harmony
between
his
faculties
and
the
truth
and
that
whether
he
doubt
or
believe
he
does
it
alike
on
his
personal
responsibility
and
risk
du

du

i
will
presently
define
exactly
what
i
mean
by
god
and
by
theism
and
explain
what
theories
i
referred
to
when
i
spoke
just
now
of
attempts
to
fly
beyond
the
one
and
to
outbid
the
other
but
first
of
all
let
me
ask
you
to
linger
a
moment
longer
over
what
i
have
called
the
reflex
theory
of
mind
so
as
to
be
sure
that
we
understand
it
absolutely
before
going
on
to
consider
those
of
its
consequences
of
which
i
am
more
particularly
to
speak
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
its
full
scope
is
grasped
even
by
those
who
have
most
zealously
promulgated
it
i
am
not
sure
for
example
that
all
physiologists
see
that
it
commits
them
to
regarding
the
mind
as
an
essentially
teleological
mechanism
i
mean
by
this
that
the
conceiving
or
theorizing
faculty
the
mind
middle
department
functions
for
the
sake
of
that
do
not
exist
at
all
in
the
world
of
impressions
we
receive
by
way
of
our
senses
but
are
set
by
our
emotional
and
practical
subjectivity
altogether
it
is
a
transformer
of
the
world
of
our
impressions
into
a
totally
different
world
the
world
of
our
conception
and
the
transformation
is
effected
in
the
interests
of
our
volitional
nature
and
for
no
other
purpose
whatsoever
destroy
the
volitional
nature
the
definite
subjective
purposes
preferences
fondnesses
for
certain
effects
forms
orders
and
not
the
slightest
motive
would
remain
for
the
brute
order
of
our
experience
to
be
remodelled
at
all
but
as
we
have
the
elaborate
volitional
constitution
we
do
have
the
remodelling
must
be
effected
there
is
no
escape
the
world
contents
are
to
each
of
us
in
an
order
so
foreign
to
our
subjective
interests
that
we
can
hardly
by
an
effort
of
the
imagination
picture
to
ourselves
what
it
is
like
we
have
to
break
that
order
altogether
and
by
picking
out
from
it
the
items
which
concern
us
and
connecting
them
with
others
far
away
which
we
say
with
them
we
are
able
to
make
out
definite
threads
of
sequence
and
tendency
to
foresee
particular
liabilities
and
get
ready
for
them
and
to
enjoy
simplicity
and
harmony
in
place
of
what
was
chaos
is
not
the
sum
of
your
actual
experience
taken
at
this
moment
and
impartially
added
together
an
utter
chaos
the
strains
of
my
voice
the
lights
and
shades
inside
the
room
and
out
the
murmur
of
the
wind
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
various
organic
feelings
you
may
happen
individually
to
possess
do
these
make
a
whole
at
all
is
it
not
the
only
condition
of
your
mental
sanity
in
the
midst
of
them
that
most
of
them
should
become
for
you
and
that
a
few
others
the
sounds
i
hope
which
i
am
uttering
should
evoke
from
places
in
your
memory
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
scene
associates
fitted
to
combine
with
them
in
what
we
call
a
rational
train
of
thought
rational
because
it
leads
to
a
conclusion
which
we
have
some
organ
to
appreciate
we
have
no
organ
or
faculty
to
appreciate
the
simply
given
order
the
real
world
as
it
is
given
objectively
at
this
moment
is
the
sum
total
of
all
its
beings
and
events
now
but
can
we
think
of
such
a
sum
can
we
realize
for
an
instant
what
a
of
all
existence
at
a
definite
point
of
time
would
be
while
i
talk
and
the
flies
buzz
a
catches
a
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
a
tree
falls
in
the
adirondack
wilderness
a
man
sneezes
in
germany
a
horse
dies
in
tartary
and
twins
are
born
in
france
what
does
that
mean
does
the
contemporaneity
of
these
events
with
one
another
and
with
a
million
others
as
disjointed
form
a
rational
bond
between
them
and
unite
them
into
anything
that
means
for
us
a
world
yet
just
such
a
collateral
contemporaneity
and
nothing
else
is
the
real
order
of
the
world
it
is
an
order
with
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
away
from
it
as
fast
as
possible
as
i
said
we
break
it
we
break
it
into
histories
and
we
break
it
into
arts
and
we
break
it
into
sciences
and
then
we
begin
to
feel
at
home
we
make
ten
thousand
separate
serial
orders
of
it
and
on
any
one
of
these
we
react
as
though
the
others
did
not
exist
we
discover
among
its
various
parts
relations
that
were
never
given
to
sense
at
all
mathematical
relations
tangents
squares
and
roots
and
logarithmic
functions
and
out
of
an
infinite
number
of
these
we
call
certain
ones
essential
and
lawgiving
and
ignore
the
rest
essential
these
relations
are
but
only
our
the
other
relations
being
just
as
real
and
present
as
they
and
our
purpose
is
to
and
to
are
not
simple
conception
and
prevision
subjective
ends
pure
and
simple
they
are
the
ends
of
what
we
call
science
and
the
miracle
of
miracles
a
miracle
not
yet
exhaustively
cleared
up
by
any
philosophy
is
that
the
given
order
lends
itself
to
the
remodelling
it
shows
itself
plastic
to
many
of
our
scientific
to
many
of
our
aesthetic
to
many
of
our
practical
purposes
and
ends
when
the
man
of
affairs
the
artist
or
the
man
of
science
fails
he
is
not
rebutted
he
tries
again
he
says
the
impressions
of
sense
give
way
be
reduced
to
the
desiderated
form
they
all
postulate
in
the
interests
of
their
volitional
nature
a
harmony
between
the
latter
and
the
nature
of
things
the
theologian
does
no
more
and
the
reflex
doctrine
of
the
mind
structure
though
all
theology
should
as
yet
have
failed
of
its
endeavor
could
but
confess
that
the
endeavor
itself
at
least
obeyed
in
form
the
mind
most
necessary
law
now
for
the
question
i
asked
above
what
kind
of
a
being
would
god
be
if
he
did
exist
the
word
has
come
to
mean
many
things
in
the
history
of
human
thought
from
venus
and
jupiter
to
the
which
figures
in
the
pages
of
hegel
even
the
laws
of
physical
nature
have
in
these
positivistic
times
been
held
worthy
of
divine
honor
and
presented
as
the
only
fitting
object
of
our
reverence
of
course
if
our
discussion
is
to
bear
any
fruit
we
must
mean
something
more
definite
than
this
we
must
not
call
any
object
of
our
loyalty
a
without
more
ado
simply
because
to
awaken
our
loyalty
happens
to
be
one
of
god
functions
he
must
have
some
intrinsic
characteristics
of
his
own
besides
and
theism
must
mean
the
faith
of
that
man
who
believes
that
the
object
of
loyalty
has
those
other
attributes
negative
or
positive
as
the
case
may
be
now
as
regards
a
great
many
of
the
attributes
of
god
and
their
amounts
and
mutual
relations
the
world
has
been
delivered
over
to
disputes
all
such
may
for
our
present
purpose
be
considered
as
quite
inessential
not
only
such
matters
as
his
mode
of
revealing
himself
the
precise
extent
of
his
providence
and
power
and
their
connection
with
our
the
proportion
of
his
mercy
to
his
justice
and
the
amount
of
his
responsibility
for
evil
but
also
his
metaphysical
relation
to
the
phenomenal
world
whether
causal
substantial
ideal
or
what
not
are
affairs
of
purely
sectarian
opinion
that
need
not
concern
us
at
all
whoso
debates
them
presupposes
the
essential
features
of
theism
to
be
granted
already
and
it
is
with
these
essential
features
the
bare
poles
of
the
subject
that
our
business
exclusively
lies
now
what
are
these
essential
features
first
it
is
essential
that
god
be
conceived
as
the
deepest
power
in
the
universe
and
second
he
must
be
conceived
under
the
form
of
a
mental
personality
the
personality
need
not
be
determined
intrinsically
any
further
than
is
involved
in
the
holding
of
certain
things
dear
and
in
the
recognition
of
our
dispositions
toward
those
things
the
things
themselves
being
all
good
and
righteous
things
but
extrinsically
considered
so
to
speak
god
personality
is
to
be
regarded
like
any
other
personality
as
something
lying
outside
of
my
own
and
other
than
me
and
whose
existence
i
simply
come
upon
and
find
a
power
not
ourselves
then
which
not
only
makes
for
righteousness
but
means
it
and
which
recognizes
us
such
is
the
definition
which
i
think
nobody
will
be
inclined
to
dispute
various
are
the
attempts
to
shadow
forth
the
other
lineaments
of
so
supreme
a
personality
to
our
human
imagination
various
the
ways
of
conceiving
in
what
mode
the
recognition
the
hearkening
to
our
cry
can
come
some
are
gross
and
idolatrous
some
are
the
most
sustained
efforts
man
intellect
has
ever
made
to
keep
still
living
on
that
subtile
edge
of
things
where
speech
and
thought
expire
but
with
all
these
differences
the
essence
remains
unchanged
in
whatever
other
respects
the
divine
personality
may
differ
from
ours
or
may
resemble
it
the
two
are
consanguineous
at
least
in
this
that
both
have
purposes
for
which
they
care
and
each
can
hear
the
other
call
meanwhile
we
can
already
see
one
consequence
and
one
point
of
connection
with
the
theory
of
mind
any
mind
constructed
on
the
pattern
must
first
get
its
impression
from
the
object
which
it
confronts
then
define
what
that
object
is
and
decide
what
active
measures
its
presence
demands
and
finally
react
the
stage
of
reaction
depends
on
the
stage
of
definition
and
these
of
course
on
the
nature
of
the
impressing
object
when
the
objects
are
concrete
particular
and
familiar
our
reactions
are
firm
and
certain
enough
often
instinctive
i
see
the
desk
and
lean
on
it
i
see
your
quiet
faces
and
i
continue
to
talk
but
the
objects
will
not
stay
concrete
and
particular
they
fuse
themselves
into
general
essences
and
they
sum
themselves
into
a
whole
the
universe
and
then
the
object
that
confronts
us
that
knocks
on
our
mental
door
and
asks
to
be
let
in
and
fixed
and
decided
upon
and
actively
met
is
just
this
whole
universe
itself
and
its
essence
what
are
and
how
shall
i
meet
the
whole
flood
of
faiths
and
systems
here
rush
in
philosophies
and
denials
of
philosophy
religions
and
atheisms
scepticisms
and
mysticisms
confirmed
emotional
moods
and
habitual
practical
biases
jostle
one
another
for
all
are
alike
trials
hasty
prolix
or
of
seemly
length
to
answer
this
momentous
question
and
the
function
of
them
all
long
or
short
that
which
the
moods
and
the
systems
alike
subserve
and
pass
into
is
the
third
stage
the
stage
of
action
for
no
one
of
them
itself
is
final
they
form
but
the
middle
segment
of
the
mental
curve
and
not
its
termination
as
the
last
theoretic
pulse
dies
away
it
does
not
leave
the
mental
process
complete
it
is
but
the
forerunner
of
the
practical
moment
in
which
alone
the
cycle
of
mentality
finds
its
rhythmic
pause
we
easily
delude
ourselves
about
this
middle
stage
sometimes
we
think
it
final
and
sometimes
we
fail
to
see
amid
the
monstrous
diversity
in
the
length
and
complication
of
the
cogitations
which
may
fill
it
that
it
can
have
but
one
essential
function
and
that
the
one
we
have
pointed
out
the
function
of
defining
the
direction
which
our
activity
immediate
or
remote
shall
take
if
i
simply
say
vanitas
vanitatum
omnia
vanitas
i
am
defining
the
total
nature
of
things
in
a
way
that
carries
practical
consequences
with
it
as
decidedly
as
if
i
write
a
treatise
de
natura
rerum
in
twenty
volumes
the
treatise
may
trace
its
consequences
more
minutely
than
the
saying
but
the
only
worth
of
either
treatise
or
saying
is
that
the
consequences
are
there
the
long
definition
can
do
no
more
than
draw
them
the
short
definition
does
no
less
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
if
two
apparently
different
definitions
of
the
reality
before
us
should
have
identical
consequences
those
two
definitions
would
really
be
identical
definitions
made
delusively
to
appear
different
merely
by
the
different
verbiage
in
which
they
are
expressed
my
time
is
unfortunately
too
short
to
stay
and
give
to
this
truth
the
development
it
deserves
but
i
will
assume
that
you
grant
it
without
further
parley
and
pass
to
the
next
step
in
my
argument
and
here
too
i
shall
have
to
bespeak
your
close
attention
for
a
moment
while
i
pass
over
the
subject
far
more
rapidly
than
it
deserves
whether
true
or
false
any
view
of
the
universe
which
shall
completely
satisfy
the
mind
must
obey
conditions
of
the
mind
own
imposing
must
at
least
let
the
mind
be
the
umpire
to
decide
whether
it
be
fit
to
be
called
a
rational
universe
or
not
not
any
nature
of
things
which
may
seem
to
be
will
also
seem
to
be
rational
and
if
it
do
not
seem
rational
it
will
afflict
the
mind
with
a
ceaseless
uneasiness
till
it
be
formulated
or
interpreted
in
some
other
and
more
congenial
way
the
study
of
what
the
mind
criteria
of
rationality
are
the
definition
of
its
exactions
in
this
respect
form
an
intensely
interesting
subject
into
which
i
can
not
enter
now
with
any
detail
but
so
much
i
think
you
will
grant
me
without
argument
that
all
three
departments
of
the
mind
alike
have
a
vote
in
the
matter
and
that
no
conception
will
pass
muster
which
violates
any
of
their
essential
modes
of
activity
or
which
leaves
them
without
a
chance
to
work
by
what
title
is
it
that
every
universal
formula
every
system
of
philosophy
which
rears
its
head
receives
the
inevitable
critical
volley
from
one
half
of
mankind
and
falls
to
the
rear
to
become
at
the
very
best
the
creed
of
some
partial
sect
either
it
has
dropped
out
of
its
net
some
of
our
impressions
of
sense
what
we
call
the
facts
of
nature
or
it
has
left
the
theoretic
and
defining
department
with
a
lot
of
inconsistencies
and
unmediated
transitions
on
its
hands
or
else
finally
it
has
left
some
one
or
more
of
our
fundamental
active
and
emotional
powers
with
no
object
outside
of
themselves
to
or
to
live
for
any
one
of
these
defects
is
fatal
to
its
complete
success
some
one
will
be
sure
to
discover
the
flaw
to
scout
the
system
and
to
seek
another
in
its
stead
i
need
not
go
far
to
collect
examples
to
illustrate
to
an
audience
of
theologians
what
i
mean
nor
will
you
in
particular
as
champions
of
the
unitarianism
of
new
england
be
slow
to
furnish
from
the
motives
which
led
to
your
departure
from
our
orthodox
ancestral
calvinism
instances
enough
under
the
third
or
practical
head
a
god
who
gives
so
little
scope
to
love
a
predestination
which
takes
from
endeavor
all
its
zest
with
all
its
fruit
are
irrational
conceptions
because
they
say
to
our
most
cherished
powers
there
is
no
object
for
you
well
just
as
within
the
limits
of
theism
some
kinds
are
surviving
others
by
reason
of
their
greater
practical
rationality
so
theism
itself
by
reason
of
its
practical
rationality
is
certain
to
survive
all
lower
creeds
materialism
and
agnosticism
even
were
they
true
could
never
gain
universal
and
popular
acceptance
for
they
both
alike
give
a
solution
of
things
which
is
irrational
to
the
practical
third
of
our
nature
and
in
which
we
can
never
volitionally
feel
at
home
each
comes
out
of
the
second
or
theoretic
stage
of
mental
functioning
with
its
definition
of
the
essential
nature
of
things
its
formula
of
formulas
prepared
the
whole
array
of
active
forces
of
our
nature
stands
waiting
impatient
for
the
word
which
shall
tell
them
how
to
discharge
themselves
most
deeply
and
worthily
upon
life
well
cry
they
what
shall
we
do
ignoramus
ignorabimus
says
agnosticism
react
upon
atoms
and
their
concussions
says
materialism
what
a
collapse
the
mental
train
misses
fire
the
middle
fails
to
ignite
the
end
the
cycle
breaks
down
to
its
conclusion
and
the
active
powers
left
alone
with
no
proper
object
on
which
to
vent
their
energy
must
either
atrophy
sicken
and
die
or
else
by
their
convulsions
and
excitement
keep
the
whole
machinery
in
a
fever
until
some
less
incommensurable
solution
some
more
practically
rational
formula
shall
provide
a
normal
issue
for
the
currents
of
the
soul
now
theism
always
stands
ready
with
the
most
practically
rational
solution
it
is
possible
to
conceive
not
an
energy
of
our
active
nature
to
which
it
does
not
authoritatively
appeal
not
an
emotion
of
which
it
does
not
normally
and
naturally
release
the
springs
at
a
single
stroke
it
changes
the
dead
blank
of
the
world
into
a
living
with
whom
the
whole
man
may
have
dealings
to
you
at
any
rate
i
need
waste
no
words
in
trying
to
prove
its
supreme
commensurateness
with
all
the
demands
that
department
number
three
of
the
mind
has
the
power
to
impose
on
department
number
two
our
volitional
nature
must
then
until
the
end
of
time
exert
a
constant
pressure
upon
the
other
departments
of
the
mind
to
induce
them
to
function
to
theistic
conclusions
no
contrary
formulas
can
be
more
than
provisionally
held
theories
must
be
always
in
unstable
equilibrium
for
department
number
three
ever
lurks
in
ambush
ready
to
assert
its
rights
and
on
the
slightest
show
of
justification
it
makes
its
fatal
spring
and
converts
them
into
the
other
form
in
which
alone
mental
peace
and
order
can
permanently
reign
the
question
is
then
departments
one
and
two
the
facts
of
nature
and
the
theoretic
elaboration
of
them
always
lead
to
theistic
conclusions
the
future
history
of
philosophy
is
the
only
authority
capable
of
answering
that
question
i
at
all
events
must
not
enter
into
it
as
that
would
be
to
abandon
the
purely
point
of
view
i
mean
to
keep
this
only
is
certain
that
the
theoretic
faculty
lives
between
two
fires
which
never
give
her
rest
and
make
her
incessantly
revise
her
formulations
if
she
sink
into
a
premature
and
idolatrous
theism
in
comes
department
number
one
with
its
battery
of
facts
of
sense
and
dislodges
her
from
her
dogmatic
repose
if
she
lazily
subside
into
equilibrium
with
the
same
facts
of
sense
viewed
in
their
simple
mechanical
outwardness
up
starts
the
practical
reason
with
its
demands
and
makes
couch
a
bed
of
thorns
from
generation
to
generation
thus
it
goes
now
a
movement
of
reception
from
without
now
one
of
expansion
from
within
department
number
two
always
worked
to
death
yet
never
excused
from
taking
the
most
responsible
part
in
the
arrangements
a
crop
of
new
facts
a
flowering
of
new
motives
the
theoretic
faculty
always
having
to
effect
the
transition
and
life
growing
withal
so
complex
and
subtle
and
immense
that
her
powers
of
conceiving
are
almost
ruptured
with
the
strain
see
how
in
france
the
of
the
academic
and
official
theistic
philosophy
are
rent
by
the
facts
of
evolution
and
how
the
young
thinkers
are
at
work
see
in
great
britain
how
the
dryness
of
the
strict
associationist
school
which
under
the
ministration
of
mill
bain
and
spencer
dominated
us
but
yesterday
gives
way
to
more
generous
idealisms
born
of
more
urgent
emotional
needs
and
wrapping
the
same
facts
in
far
more
massive
intellectual
harmonies
these
are
but
tackings
to
the
common
port
to
that
ultimate
of
maximum
subjective
as
well
as
objective
richness
which
whatever
its
other
properties
may
be
will
at
any
rate
wear
the
theistic
form
here
let
me
say
one
word
about
a
remark
we
often
hear
coming
from
the
wing
it
is
base
it
is
vile
it
is
the
lowest
depth
of
immorality
to
allow
department
number
three
to
interpose
its
demands
and
have
any
vote
in
the
question
of
what
is
true
and
what
is
false
the
mind
must
be
a
passive
reactionless
sheet
of
white
paper
on
which
reality
will
simply
come
and
register
its
own
philosophic
definition
as
the
pen
registers
the
curve
on
the
sheet
of
a
chronograph
of
all
the
cants
that
are
canted
in
this
canting
age
this
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
most
wretched
especially
when
it
comes
from
professed
psychologists
as
if
the
mind
could
consistently
with
its
definition
be
a
reactionless
sheet
at
all
as
if
conception
could
possibly
occur
except
for
a
teleological
purpose
except
to
show
us
the
way
from
a
state
of
things
our
senses
cognize
to
another
state
of
things
our
will
desires
as
if
itself
were
anything
else
than
such
an
end
of
desire
and
a
most
peculiar
one
at
that
and
as
if
the
of
bare
physics
in
particular
which
these
sticklers
for
intellectual
purity
contend
to
be
the
only
uncontaminated
form
were
not
as
great
an
alteration
and
falsification
of
the
simply
order
of
the
world
into
an
order
conceived
solely
for
the
mind
convenience
and
delight
as
any
theistic
doctrine
possibly
can
be
physics
is
but
one
chapter
in
the
great
jugglery
which
our
conceiving
faculty
is
forever
playing
with
the
order
of
being
as
it
presents
itself
to
our
reception
it
transforms
the
unutterable
dead
level
and
continuum
of
the
world
into
an
utterly
unlike
world
of
sharp
differences
and
hierarchic
subordinations
for
no
other
reason
than
to
satisfy
certain
subjective
passions
we
possess
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
the
given
world
is
there
only
for
the
sake
of
the
operation
at
any
rate
to
operate
upon
it
is
our
only
chance
of
approaching
it
for
never
can
we
get
a
glimpse
of
it
in
the
unimaginable
insipidity
of
its
virgin
estate
to
bid
the
subjective
interests
be
passive
till
truth
express
itself
from
out
the
environment
is
to
bid
the
sculptor
chisel
be
passive
till
the
statue
express
itself
from
out
the
stone
operate
we
must
and
the
only
choice
left
us
is
that
between
operating
to
poor
or
to
rich
results
the
only
possible
duty
there
can
be
in
the
matter
is
the
duty
of
getting
the
richest
results
that
the
material
given
will
allow
the
richness
lies
of
course
in
the
energy
of
all
three
departments
of
the
mental
cycle
not
a
sensible
of
department
one
must
be
left
in
the
cold
not
a
faculty
of
department
three
be
paralyzed
and
department
two
must
form
an
indestructible
bridge
it
is
natural
that
the
habitual
neglect
of
department
one
by
theologians
should
arouse
indignation
but
it
is
most
that
the
indignation
should
take
the
form
of
a
wholesale
denunciation
of
department
three
it
is
the
story
of
kant
dove
over
again
denouncing
the
pressure
of
the
air
certain
of
our
positivists
keep
chiming
to
us
that
amid
the
wreck
of
every
other
god
and
idol
one
divinity
still
stands
upright
that
his
name
is
scientific
truth
and
that
he
has
but
one
commandment
but
that
one
supreme
saying
shalt
not
be
a
for
that
would
be
to
satisfy
thy
subjective
propensities
and
the
satisfaction
of
those
is
intellectual
damnation
these
most
conscientious
gentlemen
think
they
have
jumped
off
their
own
feet
emancipated
their
mental
operations
from
the
control
of
their
subjective
propensities
at
large
and
but
they
are
deluded
they
have
simply
chosen
from
among
the
entire
set
of
propensities
at
their
command
those
that
were
certain
to
construct
out
of
the
materials
given
the
leanest
lowest
aridest
result
namely
the
bare
molecular
world
and
they
have
sacrificed
all
the
rest
man
chief
difference
from
the
brutes
lies
in
the
exuberant
excess
of
his
subjective
propensities
his
over
them
simply
and
solely
in
the
number
and
in
the
fantastic
and
unnecessary
character
of
his
wants
physical
moral
aesthetic
and
intellectual
had
his
whole
life
not
been
a
quest
for
the
superfluous
he
would
never
have
established
himself
as
inexpugnably
as
he
has
done
in
the
necessary
and
from
the
consciousness
of
this
he
should
draw
the
lesson
that
his
wants
are
to
be
trusted
that
even
when
their
gratification
seems
farthest
off
the
uneasiness
they
occasion
is
still
the
best
guide
of
his
life
and
will
lead
him
to
issues
entirely
beyond
his
present
powers
of
reckoning
prune
down
his
extravagance
sober
him
and
you
undo
him
the
appetite
for
immediate
consistency
at
any
cost
or
what
the
logicians
call
the
of
parsimony
which
is
nothing
but
the
passion
for
conceiving
the
universe
in
the
most
way
will
if
made
the
exclusive
law
of
the
mind
end
by
blighting
the
development
of
the
intellect
itself
quite
as
much
as
that
of
the
feelings
or
the
will
the
scientific
conception
of
the
world
as
an
army
of
molecules
gratifies
this
appetite
after
its
fashion
most
exquisitely
but
if
the
religion
of
exclusive
scientificism
should
ever
succeed
in
suffocating
all
other
appetites
out
of
a
nation
mind
and
imbuing
a
whole
race
with
the
persuasion
that
simplicity
and
consistency
demand
a
to
be
made
of
every
notion
that
does
not
form
part
of
the
scientific
synthesis
that
nation
that
race
will
just
as
surely
go
to
ruin
and
fall
a
prey
to
their
more
richly
constituted
neighbors
as
the
beasts
of
the
field
as
a
whole
have
fallen
a
prey
to
man
i
have
myself
little
fear
for
our
race
its
moral
aesthetic
and
practical
wants
form
too
dense
a
stubble
to
be
mown
by
any
scientific
occam
razor
that
has
yet
been
forged
the
knights
of
the
razor
will
never
form
among
us
more
than
a
sect
but
when
i
see
their
fraternity
increasing
in
numbers
and
what
is
worse
when
i
see
their
negations
acquiring
almost
as
much
prestige
and
authority
as
their
affirmations
legitimately
claim
over
the
minds
of
the
docile
public
i
feel
as
if
the
influences
working
in
the
direction
of
our
mental
barbarization
were
beginning
to
be
rather
strong
and
needed
some
positive
counteraction
and
when
i
ask
myself
from
what
quarter
the
invasion
may
best
be
checked
i
can
find
no
answer
as
good
as
the
one
suggested
by
casting
my
eyes
around
this
room
for
this
needful
task
no
fitter
body
of
men
than
the
unitarian
clergy
exists
who
can
uphold
the
rights
of
department
three
of
the
mind
with
better
grace
than
those
who
long
since
showed
how
they
could
fight
and
suffer
for
department
one
as
then
you
burst
the
bonds
of
a
narrow
ecclesiastical
tradition
by
insisting
that
no
fact
of
sense
or
result
of
science
must
be
left
out
of
account
in
the
religious
synthesis
so
may
you
still
be
the
champions
of
mental
completeness
and
may
you
with
equal
success
avert
the
formation
of
a
narrow
scientific
tradition
and
burst
the
bonds
of
any
synthesis
which
would
pretend
to
leave
out
of
account
those
forms
of
being
those
relations
of
reality
to
which
at
present
our
active
and
emotional
tendencies
are
our
only
avenues
of
approach
i
hear
it
said
that
unitarianism
is
not
growing
in
these
days
i
know
nothing
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
but
if
it
be
true
it
is
surely
because
the
great
ship
of
orthodoxy
is
nearing
the
port
and
the
pilot
is
being
taken
on
board
if
you
will
only
lead
in
a
theistic
science
as
successfully
as
you
have
led
in
a
scientific
theology
your
separate
name
as
unitarians
may
perish
from
the
mouths
of
men
for
your
task
will
have
been
done
and
your
function
at
an
end
until
that
distant
day
you
have
work
enough
in
both
directions
awaiting
you
meanwhile
let
me
pass
to
the
next
division
of
our
subject
i
said
that
we
are
forced
to
regard
god
as
the
normal
object
of
the
mind
belief
inasmuch
as
any
conception
that
falls
short
of
god
is
irrational
if
the
word
be
taken
in
its
fullest
sense
while
any
conception
that
goes
beyond
god
is
impossible
if
the
human
mind
be
constructed
after
the
pattern
we
have
discussed
at
such
length
the
first
half
of
the
thesis
has
been
disposed
of
conceptions
materialisms
and
agnosticisms
are
irrational
because
they
are
inadequate
stimuli
to
man
practical
nature
i
have
now
to
justify
the
latter
half
of
the
thesis
i
dare
say
it
may
for
an
instant
have
perplexed
some
of
you
that
i
should
speak
of
conceptions
that
aimed
at
going
beyond
god
and
of
attempts
to
fly
above
him
or
outbid
him
so
i
will
now
explain
exactly
what
i
mean
in
defining
the
essential
attributes
of
god
i
said
he
was
a
personality
lying
outside
our
own
and
other
than
us
a
power
not
ourselves
now
the
attempts
to
fly
beyond
theism
of
which
i
speak
are
attempts
to
get
over
this
ultimate
duality
of
god
and
his
believer
and
to
transform
it
into
some
sort
or
other
of
identity
if
infratheistic
ways
of
looking
on
the
world
leave
it
in
the
third
person
a
mere
and
if
theism
turns
the
into
a
so
we
may
say
that
these
other
theories
try
to
cover
it
with
the
mantle
of
the
first
person
and
to
make
it
a
part
of
i
am
well
aware
that
i
begin
here
to
tread
on
ground
in
which
trenchant
distinctions
may
easily
seem
to
mutilate
the
facts
that
sense
of
emotional
reconciliation
with
god
which
characterizes
the
highest
moments
of
the
theistic
consciousness
may
be
described
as
with
him
and
so
from
the
very
bosom
of
theism
a
monistic
doctrine
seem
to
arise
but
this
consciousness
of
of
absolute
practical
union
between
one
self
and
the
divine
object
of
one
contemplation
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
any
sort
of
substantial
identity
still
the
object
god
and
the
subject
i
are
two
still
i
simply
come
upon
him
and
find
his
existence
given
to
me
and
the
climax
of
my
practical
union
with
what
is
given
forms
at
the
same
time
the
climax
of
my
perception
that
as
a
numerical
fact
of
existence
i
am
something
radically
other
than
the
divinity
with
whose
effulgence
i
am
filled
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
sort
of
union
of
creature
with
creator
with
which
theism
properly
so
called
comports
is
of
this
emotional
and
practical
kind
and
it
is
based
unchangeably
on
the
empirical
fact
that
the
thinking
subject
and
the
object
thought
are
numerically
two
how
my
mind
and
will
which
are
not
god
can
yet
cognize
and
leap
to
meet
him
how
i
ever
came
to
be
so
separate
from
him
and
how
god
himself
came
to
be
at
all
are
problems
that
for
the
theist
can
remain
unsolved
and
insoluble
forever
it
is
sufficient
for
him
to
know
that
he
himself
simply
is
and
needs
god
and
that
behind
this
universe
god
simply
is
and
will
be
forever
and
will
in
some
way
hear
his
call
in
the
practical
assurance
of
these
empirical
facts
without
or
philosophical
ontology
without
metaphysics
of
emanation
or
creation
to
justify
or
make
them
more
intelligible
in
the
blessedness
of
their
mere
acknowledgment
as
given
lie
all
the
peace
and
power
he
craves
the
floodgates
of
the
religious
life
are
opened
and
the
full
currents
can
pour
through
it
is
this
empirical
and
practical
side
of
the
theistic
position
its
theoretic
chastity
and
modesty
which
i
wish
to
accentuate
here
the
highest
flights
of
theistic
mysticism
far
from
pretending
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
the
and
the
in
worship
and
to
transcend
the
dualism
by
an
act
of
intelligence
simply
turn
their
backs
on
such
attempts
the
problem
for
them
has
simply
vanished
vanished
from
the
sight
of
an
attitude
which
refuses
to
notice
such
futile
theoretic
difficulties
get
but
that
peace
of
god
which
passeth
understanding
and
the
questions
of
the
understanding
will
cease
from
puzzling
and
pedantic
scruples
be
at
rest
in
other
words
theistic
mysticism
that
form
of
theism
which
at
first
sight
seems
most
to
have
transcended
the
fundamental
otherness
of
god
from
man
has
done
it
least
of
all
in
the
theoretic
way
the
pattern
of
its
procedure
is
precisely
that
of
the
simplest
man
dealing
with
the
simplest
fact
of
his
environment
both
he
and
the
theist
tarry
in
department
two
of
their
minds
only
so
long
as
is
necessary
to
define
what
is
the
presence
that
confronts
them
the
theist
decides
that
its
character
is
such
as
to
be
fitly
responded
to
on
his
part
by
a
religious
reaction
and
into
that
reaction
he
forthwith
pours
his
soul
his
insight
into
the
of
life
leads
to
results
so
immediately
and
intimately
rational
that
the
the
and
the
of
it
are
questions
that
lose
all
urgency
ist
alles
faust
says
the
channels
of
department
three
have
drained
those
of
department
two
of
their
contents
and
happiness
over
the
fact
that
being
has
made
itself
what
it
is
evacuates
all
speculation
as
to
how
it
could
make
itself
at
all
but
now
although
to
most
human
minds
such
a
position
as
this
will
be
the
position
of
rational
equilibrium
it
is
not
difficult
to
bring
forward
certain
considerations
in
the
light
of
which
so
simple
and
practical
a
mental
movement
begins
to
seem
rather
and
and
devoid
of
intellectual
style
this
easy
acceptance
of
an
opaque
limit
to
our
speculative
insight
this
satisfaction
with
a
being
whose
character
we
simply
apprehend
without
comprehending
anything
more
about
him
and
with
whom
after
a
certain
point
our
dealings
can
be
only
of
a
volitional
and
emotional
sort
above
all
this
sitting
down
contented
with
a
blank
unmediated
dualism
are
they
not
the
very
picture
of
unfaithfulness
to
the
rights
and
duties
of
our
theoretic
reason
surely
if
the
universe
is
reasonable
and
we
must
believe
that
it
is
so
it
must
be
susceptible
potentially
at
least
of
being
reasoned
to
the
last
drop
without
residuum
is
it
not
rather
an
insult
to
the
very
word
to
say
that
the
rational
character
of
the
universe
and
its
creator
means
no
more
than
that
we
practically
feel
at
home
in
their
presence
and
that
our
powers
are
a
match
for
their
demands
do
they
not
in
fact
demand
to
be
by
us
still
more
than
to
be
reacted
on
is
not
the
unparalleled
development
of
department
two
of
the
mind
in
man
his
crowning
glory
and
his
very
essence
and
may
not
the
of
the
be
his
absolute
vocation
and
if
it
is
ought
he
flatly
to
acquiesce
in
a
spiritual
life
of
type
whose
form
is
no
higher
than
that
of
the
life
that
animates
his
spinal
cord
nay
indeed
that
animates
the
writhing
segments
of
any
mutilated
worm
it
is
easy
to
see
how
such
arguments
and
queries
may
result
in
the
erection
of
an
ideal
of
our
mental
destiny
far
different
from
the
simple
and
practical
religious
one
we
have
described
we
may
well
begin
to
ask
whether
such
things
as
practical
reactions
can
be
the
final
upshot
and
purpose
of
all
our
cognitive
energy
mere
outward
acts
changes
in
the
position
of
parts
of
matter
for
they
are
nothing
else
can
they
possibly
be
the
culmination
and
consummation
of
our
relations
with
the
nature
of
things
can
they
possibly
form
a
result
to
which
our
godlike
powers
of
insight
shall
be
judged
merely
subservient
such
an
idea
if
we
scan
it
closely
soon
begins
to
seem
rather
absurd
whence
this
piece
of
matter
comes
and
whither
that
one
goes
what
difference
ought
that
to
make
to
the
nature
of
things
except
so
far
as
with
the
comings
and
the
goings
our
wonderful
inward
conscious
harvest
may
be
reaped
and
so
very
naturally
and
gradually
one
may
be
led
from
the
theistic
and
practical
point
of
view
to
what
i
shall
call
the
one
we
may
think
that
department
three
of
the
mind
with
its
doings
of
right
and
its
doings
of
wrong
must
be
there
only
to
serve
department
two
and
we
may
suspect
that
the
sphere
of
our
activity
exists
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
illumine
our
cognitive
consciousness
by
the
experience
of
its
results
are
not
all
sense
and
all
emotion
at
bottom
but
turbid
and
perplexed
modes
of
what
in
its
clarified
shape
is
intelligent
cognition
is
not
all
experience
just
the
eating
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
of
good
and
evil
and
nothing
more
these
questions
fan
the
fire
of
an
unassuageable
gnostic
thirst
which
is
as
far
removed
from
theism
in
one
direction
as
agnosticism
was
removed
from
it
in
the
other
and
which
aspires
to
nothing
less
than
an
absolute
unity
of
knowledge
with
its
object
and
refuses
to
be
satisfied
short
of
a
fusion
and
solution
and
saturation
of
both
impression
and
action
with
reason
and
an
absorption
of
all
three
departments
of
the
mind
into
one
time
would
fail
us
even
had
i
the
learning
which
i
have
not
to
speak
of
gnostic
systems
in
detail
the
aim
of
all
of
them
is
to
shadow
forth
a
sort
of
process
by
which
spirit
emerging
from
its
beginnings
and
exhausting
the
whole
circle
of
finite
experience
in
its
sweep
shall
at
last
return
and
possess
itself
as
its
own
object
at
the
climax
of
its
career
this
climax
is
the
religious
consciousness
at
the
giddy
height
of
this
conception
whose
latest
and
best
known
form
is
the
hegelian
philosophy
definite
words
fail
to
serve
their
purpose
and
the
ultimate
goal
where
object
and
subject
worshipped
and
worshipper
facts
and
the
knowledge
of
them
fall
into
one
and
where
no
other
is
left
outstanding
beyond
this
one
that
alone
is
and
that
we
may
call
indifferently
act
or
fact
reality
or
idea
god
or
creation
this
goal
i
say
has
to
be
adumbrated
to
our
halting
and
gasping
intelligence
by
coarse
physical
metaphors
and
and
and
free
which
hardly
help
to
make
the
matter
clear
but
from
the
midst
of
the
curdling
and
the
circling
of
it
all
we
seem
dimly
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
state
in
which
the
reality
to
be
known
and
the
power
of
knowing
shall
have
become
so
mutually
adequate
that
each
exhaustively
is
absorbed
by
the
other
and
the
twain
become
one
flesh
and
in
which
the
light
shall
somehow
have
soaked
up
all
the
outer
darkness
into
its
own
ubiquitous
beams
like
all
headlong
ideals
this
apotheosis
of
the
bare
conceiving
faculty
has
its
depth
and
wildness
its
pang
and
its
charm
to
many
it
sings
a
truly
siren
strain
and
so
long
as
it
is
held
only
as
a
postulate
as
a
mere
vanishing
point
to
give
perspective
to
our
intellectual
aim
it
is
hard
to
see
any
empirical
title
by
which
we
may
deny
the
legitimacy
of
gnosticism
claims
that
we
are
not
as
yet
near
the
goal
it
prefigures
can
never
be
a
reason
why
we
might
not
continue
indefinitely
to
approach
it
and
to
all
sceptical
arguments
drawn
from
our
actual
finiteness
gnosticism
can
still
oppose
its
indomitable
faith
in
the
infinite
character
of
its
potential
destiny
now
here
it
is
that
the
physiologist
generalization
as
it
seems
to
me
may
fairly
come
in
and
by
ruling
any
such
extravagant
faith
out
of
court
help
to
legitimate
our
personal
mistrust
of
its
pretensions
i
confess
that
i
myself
have
always
had
a
great
mistrust
of
the
pretensions
of
the
gnostic
faith
not
only
do
i
utterly
fail
to
understand
what
a
cognitive
faculty
erected
into
the
absolute
of
being
with
itself
as
its
object
can
mean
but
even
if
we
grant
it
a
being
other
than
itself
for
object
i
can
not
reason
myself
out
of
the
belief
that
however
familiar
and
at
home
we
might
become
with
the
character
of
that
being
the
bare
being
of
it
the
fact
that
it
is
there
at
all
must
always
be
something
blankly
given
and
presupposed
in
order
that
conception
may
begin
its
work
must
in
short
lie
beyond
speculation
and
not
be
enveloped
in
its
sphere
accordingly
it
is
with
no
small
pleasure
that
as
a
student
of
physiology
and
psychology
i
find
the
only
lesson
i
can
learn
from
these
sciences
to
be
one
that
corroborates
these
convictions
from
its
first
dawn
to
its
highest
actual
attainment
we
find
that
the
cognitive
faculty
where
it
appears
to
exist
at
all
appears
but
as
one
element
in
an
organic
mental
whole
and
as
a
minister
to
higher
mental
powers
the
powers
of
will
such
a
thing
as
its
emancipation
and
absolution
from
these
organic
relations
receives
no
faintest
color
of
plausibility
from
any
fact
we
can
discern
arising
as
a
part
in
a
mental
and
objective
world
which
are
both
larger
than
itself
it
must
whatever
its
powers
of
growth
may
be
and
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
disparage
them
remain
a
part
to
the
end
this
is
the
character
of
the
cognitive
element
in
all
the
mental
life
we
know
and
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
that
character
will
ever
change
on
the
contrary
it
is
more
than
probable
that
to
the
end
of
time
our
power
of
moral
and
volitional
response
to
the
nature
of
things
will
be
the
deepest
organ
of
communication
therewith
we
shall
ever
possess
in
every
being
that
is
real
there
is
something
external
to
and
sacred
from
the
grasp
of
every
other
god
being
is
sacred
from
ours
to
with
his
creation
by
the
best
and
rightest
response
seems
all
he
wants
of
us
in
such
with
his
purposes
not
in
any
chimerical
speculative
conquest
of
him
not
in
any
theoretic
drinking
of
him
up
must
lie
the
real
meaning
of
our
destiny
this
is
nothing
new
all
men
know
it
at
those
rare
moments
when
the
soul
sobers
herself
and
leaves
off
her
chattering
and
protesting
and
insisting
about
this
formula
or
that
in
the
silence
of
our
theories
we
then
seem
to
listen
and
to
hear
something
like
the
pulse
of
being
beat
and
it
is
borne
in
upon
us
that
the
mere
turning
of
the
character
the
dumb
willingness
to
suffer
and
to
serve
this
universe
is
more
than
all
theories
about
it
put
together
the
most
any
theory
about
it
can
do
is
to
bring
us
to
that
certain
it
is
that
the
acutest
theories
the
greatest
intellectual
power
the
most
elaborate
education
are
a
sheer
mockery
when
as
too
often
happens
they
feed
mean
motives
and
a
nerveless
will
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
a
resolute
moral
energy
no
matter
how
inarticulate
or
unequipped
with
learning
its
owner
may
be
extorts
from
us
a
respect
we
should
never
pay
were
we
not
satisfied
that
the
essential
root
of
human
personality
lay
there
i
have
sketched
my
subject
in
the
briefest
outlines
but
still
i
hope
you
will
agree
that
i
have
established
my
point
and
that
the
physiological
view
of
mentality
so
far
from
invalidating
can
but
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
theistic
attitude
of
mind
between
agnosticism
and
gnosticism
theism
stands
midway
and
holds
to
what
is
true
in
each
with
agnosticism
it
goes
so
far
as
to
confess
that
we
can
not
know
how
being
made
itself
or
us
with
gnosticism
it
goes
so
far
as
to
insist
that
we
can
know
being
character
when
made
and
how
it
asks
us
to
behave
if
any
one
fear
that
in
insisting
so
strongly
that
behavior
is
the
aim
and
end
of
every
sound
philosophy
i
have
curtailed
the
dignity
and
scope
of
the
speculative
function
in
us
i
can
only
reply
that
in
this
ascertainment
of
the
of
being
lies
an
almost
infinite
speculative
task
let
the
voluminous
considerations
by
which
all
modern
thought
converges
toward
idealistic
or
conclusions
speak
for
me
let
the
pages
of
a
hodgson
of
a
lotze
of
a
renouvier
reply
whether
within
the
limits
drawn
by
purely
empirical
theism
the
speculative
faculty
finds
not
and
shall
not
always
find
enough
to
do
but
do
it
little
or
much
its
in
a
philosophy
is
always
the
same
and
is
set
by
the
structural
form
of
the
mind
philosophies
whether
expressed
in
sonnets
or
systems
all
must
wear
this
form
the
thinker
starts
from
some
experience
of
the
practical
world
and
asks
its
meaning
he
launches
himself
upon
the
speculative
sea
and
makes
a
voyage
long
or
short
he
ascends
into
the
empyrean
and
communes
with
the
eternal
essences
but
whatever
his
achievements
and
discoveries
be
while
gone
the
utmost
result
they
can
issue
in
is
some
new
practical
maxim
or
resolve
or
the
denial
of
some
old
one
with
which
inevitably
he
is
sooner
or
later
washed
ashore
on
the
of
concrete
life
again
whatever
thought
takes
this
voyage
is
a
philosophy
we
have
seen
how
theism
takes
it
and
in
the
philosophy
of
a
thinker
who
though
long
neglected
is
doing
much
to
renovate
the
spiritual
life
of
his
native
france
i
mean
charles
renouvier
whose
writings
ought
to
be
better
known
among
us
than
they
are
we
have
an
instructive
example
of
the
way
in
which
this
very
empirical
element
in
theism
its
confession
of
an
ultimate
opacity
in
things
of
a
dimension
of
being
which
escapes
our
theoretic
control
may
suggest
a
most
definite
practical
conclusion
this
one
namely
that
wills
are
free
i
will
say
nothing
of
renouvier
line
of
reasoning
it
is
contained
in
many
volumes
which
i
earnestly
recommend
to
your
attention
but
to
enforce
my
doctrine
that
the
number
of
volumes
is
not
what
makes
the
philosophy
let
me
conclude
by
recalling
to
you
the
little
poem
of
tennyson
published
last
year
in
which
the
speculative
voyage
is
made
and
the
same
conclusion
reached
in
a
few
lines
out
of
the
deep
my
child
out
of
the
deep
from
that
great
deep
before
our
world
begins
whereon
the
spirit
of
god
moves
as
he
will
out
of
the
deep
my
child
out
of
the
deep
from
that
true
world
within
the
world
we
see
whereof
our
world
is
but
the
bounding
shore
out
of
the
deep
spirit
out
of

this
fleshly

art

who
wailest

no
amount
of
failure
in
the
attempt
to
subject
the
world
of
sensible
experience
to
a
system
of
conceptions
and
to
bring
all
happenings
back
to
cases
of
immutably
valid
law

able
to
shake
our
faith
in
the
rightness
of
our
principles
we
hold
fast
to
our
demand
that
even
the
greatest
apparent
confusion
must
sooner
or
later
solve
itself
in
transparent
formulas
we
begin
the
work
ever
afresh
and
refusing
to
believe
that
nature
will
permanently
withhold
the
reward
of
our
exertions
think
rather
that
we
have
hitherto
only
failed
to
push
them
in
the
right
direction
and
all
this
pertinacity
flows
from
a
conviction
that
we
have
no
right
to
renounce
the
fulfilment
of
our
task

as
our

said
justitia

so
we
who
do
not
believe
in
justice
or

must
according
to
these
prophets
be
willing
to
see
the
world

ever
a
more
exquisite
idol

rather
of

clean
sweep

the
idol
of
stern
obligation
to
be
scientific
go
with
the
rest
and
people
will
have
a
fair
chance
to
understand

the
dilemma
of
determinism
a
common
opinion
prevails
that
the
juice
has
ages
ago
been
pressed
out
of
the
controversy
and
that
no
new
champion
can
do
more
than
warm
up
stale
arguments
which
every
one
has
heard
this
is
a
radical
mistake
i
know
of
no
subject
less
worn
out
or
in
which
inventive
genius
has
a
better
chance
of
breaking
open
new
ground
not
perhaps
of
forcing
a
conclusion
or
of
coercing
assent
but
of
deepening
our
sense
of
what
the
issue
between
the
two
parties
really
is
of
what
the
ideas
of
fate
and
of
imply
at
our
very
side
almost
in
the
past
few
years
we
have
seen
falling
in
rapid
succession
from
the
press
works
that
present
the
alternative
in
entirely
novel
lights
not
to
speak
of
the
english
disciples
of
hegel
such
as
green
and
bradley
not
to
speak
of
hinton
and
hodgson
nor
of
hazard
here
we
see
in
the
writings
of
renouvier
fouill√©e
and
delboeuf
how
completely
changed
and
refreshed
is
the
form
of
all
the
old
disputes
i
can
not
pretend
to
vie
in
originality
with
any
of
the
masters
i
have
named
and
my
ambition
limits
itself
to
just
one
little
point
if
i
can
make
two
of
the
necessarily
implied
corollaries
of
determinism
clearer
to
you
than
they
have
been
made
before
i
shall
have
made
it
possible
for
you
to
decide
for
or
against
that
doctrine
with
a
better
understanding
of
what
you
are
about
and
if
you
prefer
not
to
decide
at
all
but
to
remain
doubters
you
will
at
least
see
more
plainly
what
the
subject
of
your
hesitation
is
i
thus
disclaim
openly
on
the
threshold
all
pretension
to
prove
to
you
that
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
true
the
most
i
hope
is
to
induce
some
of
you
to
follow
my
own
example
in
assuming
it
true
and
acting
as
if
it
were
true
if
it
be
true
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
involved
in
the
strict
logic
of
the
case
its
truth
ought
not
to
be
forced
down
our
indifferent
throats
it
ought
to
be
freely
espoused
by
men
who
can
equally
well
turn
their
backs
upon
it
in
other
words
our
first
act
of
freedom
if
we
are
free
ought
in
all
inward
propriety
to
be
to
affirm
that
we
are
free
this
should
exclude
it
seems
to
me
from
the
side
of
the
question
all
hope
of
a
coercive
demonstration
a
demonstration
which
i
for
one
am
perfectly
contented
to
go
without
with
thus
much
understood
at
the
outset
we
can
advance
but
not
without
one
more
point
understood
as
well
the
arguments
i
am
about
to
urge
all
proceed
on
two
suppositions
first
when
we
make
theories
about
the
world
and
discuss
them
with
one
another
we
do
so
in
order
to
attain
a
conception
of
things
which
shall
give
us
subjective
satisfaction
and
second
if
there
be
two
conceptions
and
the
one
seems
to
us
on
the
whole
more
rational
than
the
other
we
are
entitled
to
suppose
that
the
more
rational
one
is
the
truer
of
the
two
i
hope
that
you
are
all
willing
to
make
these
suppositions
with
me
for
i
am
afraid
that
if
there
be
any
of
you
here
who
are
not
they
will
find
little
edification
in
the
rest
of
what
i
have
to
say
i
can
not
stop
to
argue
the
point
but
i
myself
believe
that
all
the
magnificent
achievements
of
mathematical
and
physical
science
our
doctrines
of
evolution
of
uniformity
of
law
and
the
rest
proceed
from
our
indomitable
desire
to
cast
the
world
into
a
more
rational
shape
in
our
minds
than
the
shape
into
which
it
is
thrown
there
by
the
crude
order
of
our
experience
the
world
has
shown
itself
to
a
great
extent
plastic
to
this
demand
of
ours
for
rationality
how
much
farther
it
will
show
itself
plastic
no
one
can
say
our
only
means
of
finding
out
is
to
try
and
i
for
one
feel
as
free
to
try
conceptions
of
moral
as
of
mechanical
or
of
logical
rationality
if
a
certain
formula
for
expressing
the
nature
of
the
world
violates
my
moral
demand
i
shall
feel
as
free
to
throw
it
overboard
or
at
least
to
doubt
it
as
if
it
disappointed
my
demand
for
uniformity
of
sequence
for
example
the
one
demand
being
so
far
as
i
can
see
quite
as
subjective
and
emotional
as
the
other
is
the
principle
of
causality
for
example
what
is
it
but
a
postulate
an
empty
name
covering
simply
a
demand
that
the
sequence
of
events
shall
some
day
manifest
a
deeper
kind
of
belonging
of
one
thing
with
another
than
the
mere
arbitrary
juxtaposition
which
now
phenomenally
appears
it
is
as
much
an
altar
to
an
unknown
god
as
the
one
that
saint
paul
found
at
athens
all
our
scientific
and
philosophic
ideals
are
altars
to
unknown
gods
uniformity
is
as
much
so
as
is
if
this
be
admitted
we
can
debate
on
even
terms
but
if
any
one
pretends
that
while
freedom
and
variety
are
in
the
first
instance
subjective
demands
necessity
and
uniformity
are
something
altogether
different
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
debate
at
all
to
begin
then
i
must
suppose
you
acquainted
with
all
the
usual
arguments
on
the
subject
i
can
not
stop
to
take
up
the
old
proofs
from
causation
from
statistics
from
the
certainty
with
which
we
can
foretell
one
another
conduct
from
the
fixity
of
character
and
all
the
rest
but
there
are
two
words
which
usually
encumber
these
classical
arguments
and
which
we
must
immediately
dispose
of
if
we
are
to
make
any
progress
one
is
the
eulogistic
word
and
the
other
is
the
opprobrious
word
the
word
i
wish
to
keep
but
i
wish
to
get
rid
of
the
word
its
eulogistic
associations
have
so
far
overshadowed
all
the
rest
of
its
meaning
that
both
parties
claim
the
sole
right
to
use
it
and
determinists
insist
that
they
alone
are
freedom
champions
determinism
was
what
we
may
call
determinism
it
did
not
shrink
from
such
words
as
fatality
bondage
of
the
will
necessitation
and
the
like
nowadays
we
have
a
determinism
which
abhors
harsh
words
and
repudiating
fatality
necessity
and
even
predetermination
says
that
its
real
name
is
freedom
for
freedom
is
only
necessity
understood
and
bondage
to
the
highest
is
identical
with
true
freedom
even
a
writer
as
little
used
to
making
capital
out
of
soft
words
as
hodgson
hesitates
not
to
call
himself
a
determinist
now
all
this
is
a
quagmire
of
evasion
under
which
the
real
issue
of
fact
has
been
entirely
smothered
freedom
in
all
these
senses
presents
simply
no
problem
at
all
no
matter
what
the
soft
determinist
mean
by
it
whether
he
mean
the
acting
without
external
constraint
whether
he
mean
the
acting
rightly
or
whether
he
mean
the
acquiescing
in
the
law
of
the
whole
who
can
not
answer
him
that
sometimes
we
are
free
and
sometimes
we
are
not
but
there
a
problem
an
issue
of
fact
and
not
of
words
an
issue
of
the
most
momentous
importance
which
is
often
decided
without
discussion
in
one
sentence
nay
in
one
clause
of
a
sentence
by
those
very
writers
who
spin
out
whole
chapters
in
their
efforts
to
show
what
freedom
is
and
that
is
the
question
of
determinism
about
which
we
are
to
talk
fortunately
no
ambiguities
hang
about
this
word
or
about
its
opposite
indeterminism
both
designate
an
outward
way
in
which
things
may
happen
and
their
cold
and
mathematical
sound
has
no
sentimental
associations
that
can
bribe
our
partiality
either
way
in
advance
now
evidence
of
an
external
kind
to
decide
between
determinism
and
indeterminism
is
as
i
intimated
a
while
back
strictly
impossible
to
find
let
us
look
at
the
difference
between
them
and
see
for
ourselves
what
does
determinism
profess
it
professes
that
those
parts
of
the
universe
already
laid
down
absolutely
appoint
and
decree
what
the
other
parts
shall
be
the
future
has
no
ambiguous
possibilities
hidden
in
its
womb
the
part
we
call
the
present
is
compatible
with
only
one
totality
any
other
future
complement
than
the
one
fixed
from
eternity
is
impossible
the
whole
is
in
each
and
every
part
and
welds
it
with
the
rest
into
an
absolute
unity
an
iron
block
in
which
there
can
be
no
equivocation
or
shadow
of
turning
with
earth
first
clay
they
did
the
last
man
knead
and
there
of
the
last
harvest
sowed
the
seed
and
the
first
morning
of
creation
wrote
what
the
last
dawn
of
reckoning
shall
read
indeterminism
on
the
contrary
says
that
the
parts
have
a
certain
amount
of
loose
play
on
one
another
so
that
the
laying
down
of
one
of
them
does
not
necessarily
determine
what
the
others
shall
be
it
admits
that
possibilities
may
be
in
excess
of
actualities
and
that
things
not
yet
revealed
to
our
knowledge
may
really
in
themselves
be
ambiguous
of
two
alternative
futures
which
we
conceive
both
may
now
be
really
possible
and
the
one
become
impossible
only
at
the
very
moment
when
the
other
excludes
it
by
becoming
real
itself
indeterminism
thus
denies
the
world
to
be
one
unbending
unit
of
fact
it
says
there
is
a
certain
ultimate
pluralism
in
it
and
so
saying
it
corroborates
our
ordinary
unsophisticated
view
of
things
to
that
view
actualities
seem
to
float
in
a
wider
sea
of
possibilities
from
out
of
which
they
are
chosen
and
indeterminism
says
such
possibilities
exist
and
form
a
part
of
truth
determinism
on
the
contrary
says
they
exist
and
that
necessity
on
the
one
hand
and
impossibility
on
the
other
are
the
sole
categories
of
the
real
possibilities
that
fail
to
get
realized
are
for
determinism
pure
illusions
they
never
were
possibilities
at
all
there
is
nothing
inchoate
it
says
about
this
universe
of
ours
all
that
was
or
is
or
shall
be
actual
in
it
having
been
from
eternity
virtually
there
the
cloud
of
alternatives
our
minds
escort
this
mass
of
actuality
withal
is
a
cloud
of
sheer
deceptions
to
which
is
the
only
name
that
rightfully
belongs
the
issue
it
will
be
seen
is
a
perfectly
sharp
one
which
no
eulogistic
terminology
can
smear
over
or
wipe
out
the
truth
lie
with
one
side
or
the
other
and
its
lying
with
one
side
makes
the
other
false
the
question
relates
solely
to
the
existence
of
possibilities
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
as
things
that
may
but
need
not
be
both
sides
admit
that
a
volition
for
instance
has
occurred
the
indeterminists
say
another
volition
might
have
occurred
in
its
place
the
determinists
swear
that
nothing
could
possibly
have
occurred
in
its
place
now
can
science
be
called
in
to
tell
us
which
of
these
two
contradicters
of
each
other
is
right
science
professes
to
draw
no
conclusions
but
such
as
are
based
on
matters
of
fact
things
that
have
actually
happened
but
how
can
any
amount
of
assurance
that
something
actually
happened
give
us
the
least
grain
of
information
as
to
whether
another
thing
might
or
might
not
have
happened
in
its
place
only
facts
can
be
proved
by
other
facts
with
things
that
are
possibilities
and
not
facts
facts
have
no
concern
if
we
have
no
other
evidence
than
the
evidence
of
existing
facts
the
must
remain
a
mystery
never
to
be
cleared
up
and
the
truth
is
that
facts
practically
have
hardly
anything
to
do
with
making
us
either
determinists
or
indeterminists
sure
enough
we
make
a
flourish
of
quoting
facts
this
way
or
that
and
if
we
are
determinists
we
talk
about
the
infallibility
with
which
we
can
predict
one
another
conduct
while
if
we
are
indeterminists
we
lay
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
it
is
just
because
we
can
not
foretell
one
another
conduct
either
in
war
or
statecraft
or
in
any
of
the
great
and
small
intrigues
and
businesses
of
men
that
life
is
so
intensely
anxious
and
hazardous
a
game
but
who
does
not
see
the
wretched
insufficiency
of
this
objective
testimony
on
both
sides
what
fills
up
the
gaps
in
our
minds
is
something
not
objective
not
external
what
divides
us
into
possibility
men
and
men
is
different
faiths
or
postulates
postulates
of
rationality
to
this
man
the
world
seems
more
rational
with
possibilities
in
it
to
that
man
more
rational
with
possibilities
excluded
and
talk
as
we
will
about
having
to
yield
to
evidence
what
makes
us
monists
or
pluralists
determinists
or
indeterminists
is
at
bottom
always
some
sentiment
like
this
the
stronghold
of
the
deterministic
sentiment
is
the
antipathy
to
the
idea
of
chance
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
talk
indeterminism
to
our
friends
we
find
a
number
of
them
shaking
their
heads
this
notion
of
alternative
possibility
they
say
this
admission
that
any
one
of
several
things
may
come
to
pass
is
after
all
only
a
roundabout
name
for
chance
and
chance
is
something
the
notion
of
which
no
sane
mind
can
for
an
instant
tolerate
in
the
world
what
is
it
they
ask
but
barefaced
crazy
unreason
the
negation
of
intelligibility
and
law
and
if
the
slightest
particle
of
it
exist
anywhere
what
is
to
prevent
the
whole
fabric
from
falling
together
the
stars
from
going
out
and
chaos
from
recommencing
her
reign
remarks
of
this
sort
about
chance
will
put
an
end
to
discussion
as
quickly
as
anything
one
can
find
i
have
already
told
you
that
was
a
word
i
wished
to
keep
and
use
let
us
then
examine
exactly
what
it
means
and
see
whether
it
ought
to
be
such
a
terrible
bugbear
to
us
i
fancy
that
squeezing
the
thistle
boldly
will
rob
it
of
its
sting
the
sting
of
the
word
seems
to
lie
in
the
assumption
that
it
means
something
positive
and
that
if
anything
happens
by
chance
it
must
needs
be
something
of
an
intrinsically
irrational
and
preposterous
sort
now
chance
means
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
a
purely
negative
and
relative
term
giving
us
no
information
about
that
of
which
it
is
predicated
except
that
it
happens
to
be
disconnected
with
something
else
not
controlled
secured
or
necessitated
by
other
things
in
advance
of
its
own
actual
presence
as
this
point
is
the
most
subtile
one
of
the
whole
lecture
and
at
the
same
time
the
point
on
which
all
the
rest
hinges
i
beg
you
to
pay
particular
attention
to
it
what
i
say
is
that
it
tells
us
nothing
about
what
a
thing
may
be
in
itself
to
call
it
it
may
be
a
bad
thing
it
may
be
a
good
thing
it
may
be
lucidity
transparency
fitness
incarnate
matching
the
whole
system
of
other
things
when
it
has
once
befallen
in
an
unimaginably
perfect
way
all
you
mean
by
calling
it
is
that
this
is
not
guaranteed
that
it
may
also
fall
out
otherwise
for
the
system
of
other
things
has
no
positive
hold
on
the
its
origin
is
in
a
certain
fashion
negative
it
escapes
and
says
hands
off
coming
when
it
comes
as
a
free
gift
or
not
at
all
this
negativeness
however
and
this
opacity
of
the
when
thus
considered
or
from
the
point
of
view
of
previous
things
or
distant
things
do
not
preclude
its
having
any
amount
of
positiveness
and
luminosity
from
within
and
at
its
own
place
and
moment
all
that
its
asserts
about
it
is
that
there
is
something
in
it
really
of
its
own
something
that
is
not
the
unconditional
property
of
the
whole
if
the
whole
wants
this
property
the
whole
must
wait
till
it
can
get
it
if
it
be
a
matter
of
chance
that
the
universe
may
actually
be
a
sort
of
society
of
this
sort
in
which
the
sharers
have
both
limited
liabilities
and
limited
powers
is
of
course
a
simple
and
conceivable
notion
nevertheless
many
persons
talk
as
if
the
minutest
dose
of
disconnectedness
of
one
part
with
another
the
smallest
modicum
of
independence
the
faintest
tremor
of
ambiguity
about
the
future
for
example
would
ruin
everything
and
turn
this
goodly
universe
into
a
sort
of
insane
or
nulliverse
no
universe
at
all
since
future
human
volitions
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
ambiguous
things
we
are
tempted
to
believe
in
let
us
stop
for
a
moment
to
make
ourselves
sure
whether
their
independent
and
accidental
character
need
be
fraught
with
such
direful
consequences
to
the
universe
as
these
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
my
choice
of
which
way
to
walk
home
after
the
lecture
is
ambiguous
and
matter
of
chance
as
far
as
the
present
moment
is
concerned
it
means
that
both
divinity
avenue
and
oxford
street
are
called
but
that
only
one
and
that
one
one
shall
be
chosen
now
i
ask
you
seriously
to
suppose
that
this
ambiguity
of
my
choice
is
real
and
then
to
make
the
impossible
hypothesis
that
the
choice
is
made
twice
over
and
each
time
falls
on
a
different
street
in
other
words
imagine
that
i
first
walk
through
divinity
avenue
and
then
imagine
that
the
powers
governing
the
universe
annihilate
ten
minutes
of
time
with
all
that
it
contained
and
set
me
back
at
the
door
of
this
hall
just
as
i
was
before
the
choice
was
made
imagine
then
that
everything
else
being
the
same
i
now
make
a
different
choice
and
traverse
oxford
street
you
as
passive
spectators
look
on
and
see
the
two
alternative
universes
one
of
them
with
me
walking
through
divinity
avenue
in
it
the
other
with
the
same
me
walking
through
oxford
street
now
if
you
are
determinists
you
believe
one
of
these
universes
to
have
been
from
eternity
impossible
you
believe
it
to
have
been
impossible
because
of
the
intrinsic
irrationality
or
accidentality
somewhere
involved
in
it
but
looking
outwardly
at
these
universes
can
you
say
which
is
the
impossible
and
accidental
one
and
which
the
rational
and
necessary
one
i
doubt
if
the
most
determinist
among
you
could
have
the
slightest
glimmer
of
light
on
this
point
in
other
words
either
universe
the
and
once
there
would
to
our
means
of
observation
and
understanding
appear
just
as
rational
as
the
other
there
would
be
absolutely
no
criterion
by
which
we
might
judge
one
necessary
and
the
other
matter
of
chance
suppose
now
we
relieve
the
gods
of
their
hypothetical
task
and
assume
my
choice
once
made
to
be
made
forever
i
go
through
divinity
avenue
for
good
and
all
if
as
good
determinists
you
now
begin
to
affirm
what
all
good
determinists
punctually
do
affirm
that
in
the
nature
of
things
i
have
gone
through
oxford
street
had
i
done
so
it
would
have
been
chance
irrationality
insanity
a
horrid
gap
in
nature
i
simply
call
your
attention
to
this
that
your
affirmation
is
what
the
germans
call
a
a
mere
conception
fulminated
as
a
dogma
and
based
on
no
insight
into
details
before
my
choice
either
street
seemed
as
natural
to
you
as
to
me
had
i
happened
to
take
oxford
street
divinity
avenue
would
have
figured
in
your
philosophy
as
the
gap
in
nature
and
you
would
have
so
proclaimed
it
with
the
best
deterministic
conscience
in
the
world
but
what
a
hollow
outcry
then
is
this
against
a
chance
which
if
it
were
present
to
us
we
could
by
no
character
whatever
distinguish
from
a
rational
necessity
i
have
taken
the
most
trivial
of
examples
but
no
possible
example
could
lead
to
any
different
result
for
what
are
the
alternatives
which
in
point
of
fact
offer
themselves
to
human
volition
what
are
those
futures
that
now
seem
matters
of
chance
are
they
not
one
and
all
like
the
divinity
avenue
and
oxford
street
of
our
example
are
they
not
all
of
them
of
things
already
here
and
based
in
the
existing
frame
of
nature
is
any
one
ever
tempted
to
produce
an
accident
something
utterly
irrelevant
to
the
rest
of
the
world
do
not
all
the
motives
that
assail
us
all
the
futures
that
offer
themselves
to
our
choice
spring
equally
from
the
soil
of
the
past
and
would
not
either
one
of
them
whether
realized
through
chance
or
through
necessity
the
moment
it
was
realized
seem
to
us
to
fit
that
past
and
in
the
completest
and
most
continuous
manner
to
interdigitate
with
the
phenomena
already
there
the
more
one
thinks
of
the
matter
the
more
one
wonders
that
so
empty
and
gratuitous
a
hubbub
as
this
outcry
against
chance
should
have
found
so
great
an
echo
in
the
hearts
of
men
it
is
a
word
which
tells
us
absolutely
nothing
about
what
chances
or
about
the
of
the
chancing
and
the
use
of
it
as
a
shows
only
a
temper
of
intellectual
absolutism
a
demand
that
the
world
shall
be
a
solid
block
subject
to
one
control
which
temper
which
demand
the
world
may
not
be
bound
to
gratify
at
all
in
every
outwardly
verifiable
and
practical
respect
a
world
in
which
the
alternatives
that
now
actually
distract
choice
were
decided
by
pure
chance
would
be
by
absolutely
undistinguished
from
the
world
in
which
i
now
live
i
am
therefore
entirely
willing
to
call
it
so
far
as
your
choices
go
a
world
of
chance
for
me
to
it
is
true
those
very
acts
of
choice
which
to
me
are
so
blind
opaque
and
external
are
the
opposites
of
this
for
you
are
within
them
and
effect
them
to
you
they
appear
as
decisions
and
decisions
for
him
who
makes
them
are
altogether
peculiar
psychic
facts
and
at
the
living
moment
at
which
they
occur
they
appeal
to
no
outside
moment
to
put
its
stamp
upon
them
or
make
them
continuous
with
the
rest
of
nature
themselves
it
is
rather
who
seem
to
make
nature
continuous
and
in
their
strange
and
intense
function
of
granting
consent
to
one
possibility
and
withholding
it
from
another
to
transform
an
equivocal
and
double
future
into
an
inalterable
and
simple
past
but
with
the
psychology
of
the
matter
we
have
no
concern
this
evening
the
quarrel
which
determinism
has
with
chance
fortunately
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
or
that
psychological
detail
it
is
a
quarrel
altogether
metaphysical
determinism
denies
the
ambiguity
of
future
volitions
because
it
affirms
that
nothing
future
can
be
ambiguous
but
we
have
said
enough
to
meet
the
issue
indeterminate
future
volitions
do
mean
chance
let
us
not
fear
to
shout
it
from
the
if
need
be
for
we
now
know
that
the
idea
of
chance
is
at
bottom
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
idea
of
gift
the
one
simply
being
a
disparaging
and
the
other
a
eulogistic
name
for
anything
on
which
we
have
no
effective
and
whether
the
world
be
the
better
or
the
worse
for
having
either
chances
or
gifts
in
it
will
depend
altogether
on
these
uncertain
and
unclaimable
things
turn
out
to
be
and
this
at
last
brings
us
within
sight
of
our
subject
we
have
seen
what
determinism
means
we
have
seen
that
indeterminism
is
rightly
described
as
meaning
chance
and
we
have
seen
that
chance
the
very
name
of
which
we
are
urged
to
shrink
from
as
from
a
metaphysical
pestilence
means
only
the
negative
fact
that
no
part
of
the
world
however
big
can
claim
to
control
absolutely
the
destinies
of
the
whole
but
although
in
discussing
the
word
i
may
at
moments
have
seemed
to
be
arguing
for
its
real
existence
i
have
not
meant
to
do
so
yet
we
have
not
yet
ascertained
whether
this
be
a
world
of
chance
or
no
at
most
we
have
agreed
that
it
seems
so
and
i
now
repeat
what
i
said
at
the
outset
that
from
any
strict
theoretical
point
of
view
the
question
is
insoluble
to
deepen
our
theoretic
sense
of
the
between
a
world
with
chances
in
it
and
a
deterministic
world
is
the
most
i
can
hope
to
do
and
this
i
may
now
at
last
begin
upon
after
all
our
tedious
clearing
of
the
way
i
wish
first
of
all
to
show
you
just
what
the
notion
that
this
is
a
deterministic
world
implies
the
implications
i
call
your
attention
to
are
all
bound
up
with
the
fact
that
it
is
a
world
in
which
we
constantly
have
to
make
what
i
shall
with
your
permission
call
judgments
of
regret
hardly
an
hour
passes
in
which
we
do
not
wish
that
something
might
be
otherwise
and
happy
indeed
are
those
of
us
whose
hearts
have
never
echoed
the
wish
of
omar
khayam
that
we
might
clasp
ere
closed
the
book
of
fate
and
make
the
writer
on
a
fairer
leaf
inscribe
our
names
or
quite
obliterate
ah
love
could
you
and
i
with
fate
conspire
to
mend
this
sorry
scheme
of
things
entire
would
we
not
shatter
it
to
bits
and
then
remould
it
nearer
to
the
heart
desire
now
it
is
undeniable
that
most
of
these
regrets
are
foolish
and
quite
on
a
par
in
point
of
philosophic
value
with
the
criticisms
on
the
universe
of
that
friend
of
our
infancy
the
hero
of
the
fable
the
atheist
and
the
acorn
fool
had
that
bough
a
pumpkin
bore
thy
whimsies
would
have
worked
no
more
etc
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
own
ends
we
should
probably
make
a
botch
of
remodelling
the
universe
how
much
more
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
ends
we
can
not
see
wise
men
therefore
regret
as
little
as
they
can
but
still
some
regrets
are
pretty
obstinate
and
hard
to
stifle
regrets
for
acts
of
wanton
cruelty
or
treachery
for
example
whether
performed
by
others
or
by
ourselves
hardly
any
one
can
remain
optimistic
after
reading
the
confession
of
the
murderer
at
brockton
the
other
day
how
to
get
rid
of
the
wife
whose
continued
existence
bored
him
he
inveigled
her
into
a
desert
spot
shot
her
four
times
and
then
as
she
lay
on
the
ground
and
said
to
him
you
do
it
on
purpose
did
you
dear
replied
no
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
as
he
raised
a
rock
and
smashed
her
skull
such
an
occurrence
with
the
mild
sentence
and
of
the
prisoner
is
a
field
for
a
crop
of
regrets
which
one
need
not
take
up
in
detail
we
feel
that
although
a
perfect
mechanical
fit
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
it
is
a
bad
moral
fit
and
that
something
else
would
really
have
been
better
in
its
place
but
for
the
deterministic
philosophy
the
murder
the
sentence
and
the
prisoner
optimism
were
all
necessary
from
eternity
and
nothing
else
for
a
moment
had
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
being
put
into
their
place
to
admit
such
a
chance
the
determinists
tell
us
would
be
to
make
a
suicide
of
reason
so
we
must
steel
our
hearts
against
the
thought
and
here
our
plot
thickens
for
we
see
the
first
of
those
difficult
implications
of
determinism
and
monism
which
it
is
my
purpose
to
make
you
feel
if
this
brockton
murder
was
called
for
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
if
it
had
to
come
at
its
preappointed
hour
and
if
nothing
else
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
sense
of
the
whole
what
are
we
to
think
of
the
universe
are
we
stubbornly
to
stick
to
our
judgment
of
regret
and
say
though
it
be
yet
it
have
been
a
better
universe
with
something
different
from
this
brockton
murder
in
it
that
of
course
seems
the
natural
and
spontaneous
thing
for
us
to
do
and
yet
it
is
nothing
short
of
deliberately
espousing
a
kind
of
pessimism
the
judgment
of
regret
calls
the
murder
bad
calling
a
thing
bad
means
if
it
mean
anything
at
all
that
the
thing
ought
not
to
be
that
something
else
ought
to
be
in
its
stead
determinism
in
denying
that
anything
else
can
be
in
its
stead
virtually
defines
the
universe
as
a
place
in
which
what
ought
to
be
is
impossible
in
other
words
as
an
organism
whose
constitution
is
afflicted
with
an
incurable
taint
an
irremediable
flaw
the
pessimism
of
a
schopenhauer
says
no
more
than
this
that
the
murder
is
a
symptom
and
that
it
is
a
vicious
symptom
because
it
belongs
to
a
vicious
whole
which
can
express
its
nature
no
otherwise
than
by
bringing
forth
just
such
a
symptom
as
that
at
this
particular
spot
regret
for
the
murder
must
transform
itself
if
we
are
determinists
and
wise
into
a
larger
regret
it
is
absurd
to
regret
the
murder
alone
other
things
being
what
they
are
could
not
be
different
what
we
should
regret
is
that
whole
frame
of
things
of
which
the
murder
is
one
member
i
see
no
escape
whatever
from
this
pessimistic
conclusion
if
being
determinists
our
judgment
of
regret
is
to
be
allowed
to
stand
at
all
the
only
deterministic
escape
from
pessimism
is
everywhere
to
abandon
the
judgment
of
regret
that
this
can
be
done
history
shows
to
be
not
impossible
the
devil
may
be
good
that
is
although
he
be
a
of
evil
yet
the
universe
with
such
a
principle
in
it
may
practically
be
a
better
universe
than
it
could
have
been
without
on
every
hand
in
a
small
way
we
find
that
a
certain
amount
of
evil
is
a
condition
by
which
a
higher
form
of
good
is
bought
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
anybody
from
generalizing
this
view
and
trusting
that
if
we
could
but
see
things
in
the
largest
of
all
ways
even
such
matters
as
this
brockton
murder
would
appear
to
be
paid
for
by
the
uses
that
follow
in
their
train
an
optimism
a
systematic
and
infatuated
optimism
like
that
ridiculed
by
voltaire
in
his
candide
is
one
of
the
possible
ideal
ways
in
which
a
man
may
train
himself
to
look
on
life
bereft
of
dogmatic
hardness
and
lit
up
with
the
expression
of
a
tender
and
pathetic
hope
such
an
optimism
has
been
the
grace
of
some
of
the
most
religious
characters
that
ever
lived
throb
thine
with
nature
throbbing
breast
and
all
is
clear
from
east
to
west
even
cruelty
and
treachery
may
be
among
the
absolutely
blessed
fruits
of
time
and
to
quarrel
with
any
of
their
details
may
be
blasphemy
the
only
real
blasphemy
in
short
may
be
that
pessimistic
temper
of
the
soul
which
lets
it
give
way
to
such
things
as
regrets
remorse
and
grief
thus
our
deterministic
pessimism
may
become
a
deterministic
optimism
at
the
price
of
extinguishing
our
judgments
of
regret
but
does
not
this
immediately
bring
us
into
a
curious
logical
predicament
our
determinism
leads
us
to
call
our
judgments
of
regret
wrong
because
they
are
pessimistic
in
implying
that
what
is
impossible
yet
ought
to
be
but
how
then
about
the
judgments
of
regret
themselves
if
they
are
wrong
other
judgments
judgments
of
approval
presumably
ought
to
be
in
their
place
but
as
they
are
necessitated
nothing
else
be
in
their
place
and
the
universe
is
just
what
it
was
before
namely
a
place
in
which
what
ought
to
be
appears
impossible
we
have
got
one
foot
out
of
the
pessimistic
bog
but
the
other
one
sinks
all
the
deeper
we
have
rescued
our
actions
from
the
bonds
of
evil
but
our
judgments
are
now
held
fast
when
murders
and
treacheries
cease
to
be
sins
regrets
are
theoretic
absurdities
and
errors
the
theoretic
and
the
active
life
thus
play
a
kind
of
with
each
other
on
the
ground
of
evil
the
rise
of
either
sends
the
other
down
murder
and
treachery
can
not
be
good
without
regret
being
bad
regret
can
not
be
good
without
treachery
and
murder
being
bad
both
however
are
supposed
to
have
been
foredoomed
so
something
must
be
fatally
unreasonable
absurd
and
wrong
in
the
world
it
must
be
a
place
of
which
either
sin
or
error
forms
a
necessary
part
from
this
dilemma
there
seems
at
first
sight
no
escape
are
we
then
so
soon
to
fall
back
into
the
pessimism
from
which
we
thought
we
had
emerged
and
is
there
no
possible
way
by
which
we
may
with
good
intellectual
consciences
call
the
cruelties
and
the
treacheries
the
reluctances
and
the
regrets
good
together
certainly
there
is
such
a
way
and
you
are
probably
most
of
you
ready
to
formulate
it
yourselves
but
before
doing
so
remark
how
inevitably
the
question
of
determinism
and
indeterminism
slides
us
into
the
question
of
optimism
and
pessimism
or
as
our
fathers
called
it
question
of
evil
the
theological
form
of
all
these
disputes
is
the
simplest
and
the
deepest
the
form
from
which
there
is
the
least
escape
not
because
as
some
have
sarcastically
said
remorse
and
regret
are
clung
to
with
a
morbid
fondness
by
the
theologians
as
spiritual
luxuries
but
because
they
are
existing
facts
of
the
world
and
as
such
must
be
taken
into
account
in
the
deterministic
interpretation
of
all
that
is
fated
to
be
if
they
are
fated
to
be
error
does
not
the
bat
wing
of
irrationality
still
cast
its
shadow
over
the
world
the
refuge
from
the
quandary
lies
as
i
said
not
far
off
the
necessary
acts
we
erroneously
regret
may
be
good
and
yet
our
error
in
so
regretting
them
may
be
also
good
on
one
simple
condition
and
that
condition
is
this
the
world
must
not
be
regarded
as
a
machine
whose
final
purpose
is
the
making
real
of
any
outward
good
but
rather
as
a
contrivance
for
deepening
the
theoretic
consciousness
of
what
goodness
and
evil
in
their
intrinsic
natures
are
not
the
doing
either
of
good
or
of
evil
is
what
nature
cares
for
but
the
knowing
of
them
life
is
one
long
eating
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
i
am
in
the
habit
in
thinking
to
myself
of
calling
this
point
of
view
the
point
of
view
according
to
it
the
world
is
neither
an
optimism
nor
a
pessimism
but
a
but
as
this
term
may
perhaps
lead
to
some
misunderstandings
i
will
use
it
as
little
as
possible
here
and
speak
rather
of
and
the
point
of
view
subjectivism
has
three
great
branches
we
may
call
them
scientificism
sentimentalism
and
sensualism
respectively
they
all
agree
essentially
about
the
universe
in
deeming
that
what
happens
there
is
subsidiary
to
what
we
think
or
feel
about
it
crime
justifies
its
criminality
by
awakening
our
intelligence
of
that
criminality
and
eventually
our
remorses
and
regrets
and
the
error
included
in
remorses
and
regrets
the
error
of
supposing
that
the
past
could
have
been
different
justifies
itself
by
its
use
its
use
is
to
quicken
our
sense
of
the
irretrievably
lost
is
when
we
think
of
it
as
that
which
might
have
been
saddest
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
quality
of
its
worth
speaks
to
us
with
a
wilder
sweetness
and
conversely
the
dissatisfaction
wherewith
we
think
of
what
seems
to
have
driven
it
from
its
natural
place
gives
us
the
severer
pang
admirable
artifice
of
nature
we
might
be
tempted
to
exclaim
deceiving
us
in
order
the
better
to
enlighten
us
and
leaving
nothing
undone
to
accentuate
to
our
consciousness
the
yawning
distance
of
those
opposite
poles
of
good
and
evil
between
which
creation
swings
we
have
thus
clearly
revealed
to
our
view
what
may
be
called
the
dilemma
of
determinism
so
far
as
determinism
pretends
to
think
things
out
at
all
a
merely
mechanical
determinism
it
is
true
rather
rejoices
in
not
thinking
them
out
it
is
very
sure
that
the
universe
must
satisfy
its
postulate
of
a
physical
continuity
and
coherence
but
it
smiles
at
any
one
who
comes
forward
with
a
postulate
of
moral
coherence
as
well
i
may
suppose
however
that
the
number
of
purely
mechanical
or
hard
determinists
among
you
this
evening
is
small
the
determinism
to
whose
seductions
you
are
most
exposed
is
what
i
have
called
soft
determinism
the
determinism
which
allows
considerations
of
good
and
bad
to
mingle
with
those
of
cause
and
effect
in
deciding
what
sort
of
a
universe
this
may
rationally
be
held
to
be
the
dilemma
of
this
determinism
is
one
whose
left
horn
is
pessimism
and
whose
right
horn
is
subjectivism
in
other
words
if
determinism
is
to
escape
pessimism
it
must
leave
off
looking
at
the
goods
and
ills
of
life
in
a
simple
objective
way
and
regard
them
as
materials
indifferent
in
themselves
for
the
production
of
consciousness
scientific
and
ethical
in
us
to
escape
pessimism
is
as
we
all
know
no
easy
task
your
own
studies
have
sufficiently
shown
you
the
almost
desperate
difficulty
of
making
the
notion
that
there
is
a
single
principle
of
things
and
that
principle
absolute
perfection
rhyme
together
with
our
daily
vision
of
the
facts
of
life
if
perfection
be
the
principle
how
comes
there
any
imperfection
here
if
god
be
good
how
came
he
to
create
or
if
he
did
not
create
how
comes
he
to
permit
the
devil
the
evil
facts
must
be
explained
as
seeming
the
devil
must
be
whitewashed
the
universe
must
be
disinfected
if
neither
goodness
nor
his
unity
and
power
are
to
remain
impugned
and
of
all
the
various
ways
of
operating
the
disinfection
and
making
bad
seem
less
bad
the
way
of
subjectivism
appears
by
far
the
best
for
after
all
is
there
not
something
rather
absurd
in
our
ordinary
notion
of
external
things
being
good
or
bad
in
themselves
can
murders
and
treacheries
considered
as
mere
outward
happenings
or
motions
of
matter
be
bad
without
any
one
to
feel
their
badness
and
could
paradise
properly
be
good
in
the
absence
of
a
sentient
principle
by
which
the
goodness
was
perceived
outward
goods
and
evils
seem
practically
indistinguishable
except
in
so
far
as
they
result
in
getting
moral
judgments
made
about
them
but
then
the
moral
judgments
seem
the
main
thing
and
the
outward
facts
mere
perishing
instruments
for
their
production
this
is
subjectivism
every
one
must
at
some
time
have
wondered
at
that
strange
paradox
of
our
moral
nature
that
though
the
pursuit
of
outward
good
is
the
breath
of
its
nostrils
the
attainment
of
outward
good
would
seem
to
be
its
suffocation
and
death
why
does
the
painting
of
any
paradise
or
utopia
in
heaven
or
on
earth
awaken
such
yawnings
for
nirvana
and
escape
the
heaven
of
our
and
the
ladylike
elysium
represented
in
spencer
data
of
ethics
as
the
final
consummation
of
progress
are
exactly
on
a
par
in
this
respect
lubberlands
pure
and
simple
one
and
all
we
look
upon
them
from
this
delicious
mess
of
insanities
and
realities
strivings
and
deadnesses
hopes
and
fears
agonies
and
exultations
which
forms
our
present
state
and
is
the
only
sentiment
they
awaken
in
our
breasts
to
our
crepuscular
natures
born
for
the
conflict
the
rembrandtesque
moral
chiaroscuro
the
shifting
struggle
of
the
sunbeam
in
the
gloom
such
pictures
of
light
upon
light
are
vacuous
and
expressionless
and
neither
to
be
enjoyed
nor
understood
if
be
the
whole
fruit
of
the
victory
we
say
if
the
generations
of
mankind
suffered
and
laid
down
their
lives
if
prophets
confessed
and
martyrs
sang
in
the
fire
and
all
the
sacred
tears
were
shed
for
no
other
end
than
that
a
race
of
creatures
of
such
unexampled
insipidity
should
succeed
and
protract
saecula
their
contented
and
inoffensive
lives
why
at
such
a
rate
better
lose
than
win
the
battle
or
at
all
events
better
ring
down
the
curtain
before
the
last
act
of
the
play
so
that
a
business
that
began
so
importantly
may
be
saved
from
so
singularly
flat
a
all
this
is
what
i
should
instantly
say
were
i
called
on
to
plead
for
gnosticism
and
its
real
friends
of
whom
you
will
presently
perceive
i
am
not
one
would
say
without
difficulty
a
great
deal
more
regarded
as
a
stable
finality
every
outward
good
becomes
a
mere
weariness
to
the
flesh
it
must
be
menaced
be
occasionally
lost
for
its
goodness
to
be
fully
felt
as
such
nay
more
than
occasionally
lost
no
one
knows
the
worth
of
innocence
till
he
knows
it
is
gone
forever
and
that
money
can
not
buy
it
back
not
the
saint
but
the
sinner
that
repenteth
is
he
to
whom
the
full
length
and
breadth
and
height
and
depth
of
life
meaning
is
revealed
not
the
absence
of
vice
but
vice
there
and
virtue
holding
her
by
the
throat
seems
the
ideal
human
state
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
suppose
it
not
a
permanent
human
state
there
is
a
deep
truth
in
what
the
school
of
schopenhauer
insists
on
the
illusoriness
of
the
notion
of
moral
progress
the
more
brutal
forms
of
evil
that
go
are
replaced
by
others
more
subtle
and
more
poisonous
our
moral
horizon
moves
with
us
as
we
move
and
never
do
we
draw
nearer
to
the
line
where
the
black
waves
and
the
azure
meet
the
final
purpose
of
our
creation
seems
most
plausibly
to
be
the
greatest
possible
enrichment
of
our
ethical
consciousness
through
the
intensest
play
of
contrasts
and
the
widest
diversity
of
characters
this
of
course
obliges
some
of
us
to
be
vessels
of
wrath
while
it
calls
others
to
be
vessels
of
honor
but
the
subjectivist
point
of
view
reduces
all
these
outward
distinctions
to
a
common
denominator
the
wretch
languishing
in
the
felon
cell
may
be
drinking
draughts
of
the
wine
of
truth
that
will
never
pass
the
lips
of
the
favorite
of
fortune
and
the
peculiar
consciousness
of
each
of
them
is
an
indispensable
note
in
the
great
ethical
concert
which
the
centuries
as
they
roll
are
grinding
out
of
the
living
heart
of
man
so
much
for
subjectivism
if
the
dilemma
of
determinism
be
to
choose
between
it
and
pessimism
i
see
little
room
for
hesitation
from
the
strictly
theoretical
point
of
view
subjectivism
seems
the
more
rational
scheme
and
the
world
may
possibly
for
aught
i
know
be
nothing
else
when
the
healthy
love
of
life
is
on
one
and
all
its
forms
and
its
appetites
seem
so
unutterably
real
when
the
most
brutal
and
the
most
spiritual
things
are
lit
by
the
same
sun
and
each
is
an
integral
part
of
the
total
richness
why
then
it
seems
a
grudging
and
sickly
way
of
meeting
so
robust
a
universe
to
shrink
from
any
of
its
facts
and
wish
them
not
to
be
rather
take
the
strictly
dramatic
point
of
view
and
treat
the
whole
thing
as
a
great
unending
romance
which
the
spirit
of
the
universe
striving
to
realize
its
own
content
is
eternally
thinking
out
and
representing
to
itself
no
one
i
hope
will
accuse
me
after
i
have
said
all
this
of
underrating
the
reasons
in
favor
of
subjectivism
and
now
that
i
proceed
to
say
why
those
reasons
strong
as
they
are
fail
to
convince
my
own
mind
i
trust
the
presumption
may
be
that
my
objections
are
stronger
still
i
frankly
confess
that
they
are
of
a
practical
order
if
we
practically
take
up
subjectivism
in
a
sincere
and
radical
manner
and
follow
its
consequences
we
meet
with
some
that
make
us
pause
let
a
subjectivism
begin
in
never
so
severe
and
intellectual
a
way
it
is
forced
by
the
law
of
its
nature
to
develop
another
side
of
itself
and
end
with
the
corruptest
curiosity
once
dismiss
the
notion
that
certain
duties
are
good
in
themselves
and
that
we
are
here
to
do
them
no
matter
how
we
feel
about
them
once
consecrate
the
opposite
notion
that
our
performances
and
our
violations
of
duty
are
for
a
common
purpose
the
attainment
of
subjective
knowledge
and
feeling
and
that
the
deepening
of
these
is
the
chief
end
of
our
lives
and
at
what
point
on
the
downward
slope
are
we
to
stop
in
theology
subjectivism
develops
as
its
wing
antinomianism
in
literature
its
left
wing
is
romanticism
and
in
practical
life
it
is
either
a
nerveless
sentimentality
or
a
sensualism
without
bounds
everywhere
it
fosters
the
fatalistic
mood
of
mind
it
makes
those
who
are
already
too
inert
more
passive
still
it
renders
wholly
reckless
those
whose
energy
is
already
in
excess
all
through
history
we
find
how
subjectivism
as
soon
as
it
has
a
free
career
exhausts
itself
in
every
sort
of
spiritual
moral
and
practical
license
its
optimism
turns
to
an
ethical
indifference
which
infallibly
brings
dissolution
in
its
train
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
say
now
that
if
the
hegelian
gnosticism
which
has
begun
to
show
itself
here
and
in
great
britain
were
to
become
a
popular
philosophy
as
it
once
was
in
germany
it
would
certainly
develop
its
left
wing
here
as
there
and
produce
a
reaction
of
disgust
already
i
have
heard
a
graduate
of
this
very
school
express
in
the
pulpit
his
willingness
to
sin
like
david
if
only
he
might
repent
like
david
you
may
tell
me
he
was
only
sowing
his
wild
or
rather
his
tame
oats
and
perhaps
he
was
but
the
point
is
that
in
the
subjectivistic
or
gnostical
philosophy
wild
or
tame
becomes
a
systematic
necessity
and
the
chief
function
of
life
after
the
pure
and
classic
truths
the
exciting
and
rancid
ones
must
be
experienced
and
if
the
stupid
virtues
of
the
philistine
herd
do
not
then
come
in
and
save
society
from
the
influence
of
the
children
of
light
a
sort
of
inward
putrefaction
becomes
its
inevitable
doom
look
at
the
last
runnings
of
the
romantic
school
as
we
see
them
in
that
strange
contemporary
parisian
literature
with
which
we
of
the
less
clever
countries
are
so
often
driven
to
rinse
out
our
minds
after
they
have
become
clogged
with
the
dulness
and
heaviness
of
our
native
pursuits
the
romantic
school
began
with
the
worship
of
subjective
sensibility
and
the
revolt
against
legality
of
which
rousseau
was
the
first
great
prophet
and
through
various
fluxes
and
refluxes
right
wings
and
left
wings
it
stands
with
two
men
of
genius
renan
and
zola
as
its
principal
exponents
one
speaking
with
its
masculine
and
the
other
with
what
might
be
called
its
feminine
voice
i
prefer
not
to
think
now
of
less
noble
members
of
the
school
and
the
renan
i
have
in
mind
is
of
course
the
renan
of
latest
dates
as
i
have
used
the
term
gnostic
both
he
and
zola
are
gnostics
of
the
most
pronounced
sort
both
are
athirst
for
the
facts
of
life
and
both
think
the
facts
of
human
sensibility
to
be
of
all
facts
the
most
worthy
of
attention
both
agree
moreover
that
sensibility
seems
to
be
there
for
no
higher
purpose
certainly
not
as
the
philistines
say
for
the
sake
of
bringing
mere
outward
rights
to
pass
and
frustrating
outward
wrongs
one
dwells
on
the
sensibilities
for
their
energy
the
other
for
their
sweetness
one
speaks
with
a
voice
of
bronze
the
other
with
that
of
an
√¶olian
harp
one
ruggedly
ignores
the
distinction
of
good
and
evil
the
other
plays
the
coquette
between
the
craven
unmanliness
of
his
philosophic
dialogues
and
the
butterfly
optimism
of
his
souvenirs
de
jeunesse
but
under
the
pages
of
both
there
sounds
incessantly
the
hoarse
bass
of
vanitatum
omnia
which
the
reader
may
hear
whenever
he
will
between
the
lines
no
writer
of
this
french
romantic
school
has
a
word
of
rescue
from
the
hour
of
satiety
with
the
things
of
life
the
hour
in
which
we
say
i
take
no
pleasure
in
them
or
from
the
hour
of
terror
at
the
vast
meaningless
grinding
if
perchance
such
hours
should
come
for
terror
and
satiety
are
facts
of
sensibility
like
any
others
and
at
their
own
hour
they
reign
in
their
own
right
the
heart
of
the
romantic
utterances
whether
poetical
critical
or
historical
is
this
inward
remedilessness
what
carlyle
calls
this
whimpering
of
wail
and
woe
and
from
this
romantic
state
of
mind
there
is
absolutely
no
possible
escape
whether
like
renan
we
look
upon
life
in
a
more
refined
way
as
a
romance
of
the
spirit
or
whether
like
the
friends
of
zola
we
pique
ourselves
on
our
and
character
and
prefer
to
be
cynical
and
call
the
world
a
experimental
on
an
infinite
scale
in
either
case
the
world
appears
to
us
potentially
as
what
the
same
carlyle
once
called
it
a
vast
gloomy
solitary
golgotha
and
mill
of
death
the
only
escape
is
by
the
practical
way
and
since
i
have
mentioned
the
nowadays
name
of
carlyle
let
me
mention
it
once
more
and
say
it
is
the
way
of
his
teaching
no
matter
for
carlyle
life
no
matter
for
a
great
deal
of
his
writing
what
was
the
most
important
thing
he
said
to
us
he
said
hang
your
sensibilities
stop
your
snivelling
complaints
and
your
equally
snivelling
raptures
leave
off
your
general
emotional
tomfoolery
and
get
to
work
like
men
but
this
means
a
complete
rupture
with
the
subjectivist
philosophy
of
things
it
says
conduct
and
not
sensibility
is
the
ultimate
fact
for
our
recognition
with
the
vision
of
certain
works
to
be
done
of
certain
outward
changes
to
be
wrought
or
resisted
it
says
our
intellectual
horizon
terminates
no
matter
how
we
succeed
in
doing
these
outward
duties
whether
gladly
and
spontaneously
or
heavily
and
unwillingly
do
them
we
somehow
must
for
the
leaving
of
them
undone
is
perdition
no
matter
how
we
feel
if
we
are
only
faithful
in
the
outward
act
and
refuse
to
do
wrong
the
world
will
in
so
far
be
safe
and
we
quit
of
our
debt
toward
it
take
then
the
yoke
upon
our
shoulders
bend
our
neck
beneath
the
heavy
legality
of
its
weight
regard
something
else
than
our
feeling
as
our
limit
our
master
and
our
law
be
willing
to
live
and
die
in
its
service
and
at
a
stroke
we
have
passed
from
the
subjective
into
the
objective
philosophy
of
things
much
as
one
awakens
from
some
feverish
dream
full
of
bad
lights
and
noises
to
find
one
self
bathed
in
the
sacred
coolness
and
quiet
of
the
air
of
the
night
but
what
is
the
essence
of
this
philosophy
of
objective
conduct
so
and
finite
but
so
chaste
and
sane
and
strong
when
compared
with
its
romantic
rival
it
is
the
recognition
of
limits
foreign
and
opaque
to
our
understanding
it
is
the
willingness
after
bringing
about
some
external
good
to
feel
at
peace
for
our
responsibility
ends
with
the
performance
of
that
duty
and
the
burden
of
the
rest
we
may
lay
on
higher
powers
look
to
thyself
o
universe
thou
art
better
and
not
worse
we
may
say
in
that
philosophy
the
moment
we
have
done
our
stroke
of
conduct
however
small
for
in
the
view
of
that
philosophy
the
universe
belongs
to
a
plurality
of
forces
each
one
of
which
may
help
or
hinder
and
be
helped
or
hindered
by
the
operations
of
the
rest
but
this
brings
us
right
back
after
such
a
long
detour
to
the
question
of
indeterminism
and
to
the
conclusion
of
all
i
came
here
to
say
for
the
only
consistent
way
of
representing
a
pluralism
and
a
world
whose
parts
may
affect
one
another
through
their
conduct
being
either
good
or
bad
is
the
indeterministic
way
what
interest
zest
or
excitement
can
there
be
in
achieving
the
right
way
unless
we
are
enabled
to
feel
that
the
wrong
way
is
also
a
possible
and
a
natural
way
nay
more
a
menacing
and
an
imminent
way
and
what
sense
can
there
be
in
condemning
ourselves
for
taking
the
wrong
way
unless
we
need
have
done
nothing
of
the
sort
unless
the
right
way
was
open
to
us
as
well
i
can
not
understand
the
willingness
to
act
no
matter
how
we
feel
without
the
belief
that
acts
are
really
good
and
bad
i
can
not
understand
the
belief
that
an
act
is
bad
without
regret
at
its
happening
i
can
not
understand
regret
without
the
admission
of
real
genuine
possibilities
in
the
world
only
is
it
other
than
a
mockery
to
feel
after
we
have
failed
to
do
our
best
that
an
irreparable
opportunity
is
gone
from
the
universe
the
loss
of
which
it
must
forever
after
mourn
if
you
insist
that
this
is
all
superstition
that
possibility
is
in
the
eye
of
science
and
reason
impossibility
and
that
if
i
act
badly
is
that
the
universe
was
foredoomed
to
suffer
this
defect
you
fall
right
back
into
the
dilemma
the
labyrinth
of
pessimism
and
subjectivism
from
out
of
whose
toils
we
have
just
wound
our
way
now
we
are
of
course
free
to
fall
back
if
we
please
for
my
own
part
though
whatever
difficulties
may
beset
the
philosophy
of
objective
right
and
wrong
and
the
indeterminism
it
seems
to
imply
determinism
with
its
alternative
of
pessimism
or
romanticism
contains
difficulties
that
are
greater
still
but
you
will
remember
that
i
expressly
repudiated
awhile
ago
the
pretension
to
offer
any
arguments
which
could
be
coercive
in
a
scientific
fashion
in
this
matter
and
i
consequently
find
myself
at
the
end
of
this
long
talk
obliged
to
state
my
conclusions
in
an
altogether
personal
way
this
personal
method
of
appeal
seems
to
be
among
the
very
conditions
of
the
problem
and
the
most
any
one
can
do
is
to
confess
as
candidly
as
he
can
the
grounds
for
the
faith
that
is
in
him
and
leave
his
example
to
work
on
others
as
it
may
let
me
then
without
circumlocution
say
just
this
the
world
is
enigmatical
enough
in
all
conscience
whatever
theory
we
may
take
up
toward
it
the
indeterminism
i
defend
the
theory
of
popular
sense
based
on
the
judgment
of
regret
represents
that
world
as
vulnerable
and
liable
to
be
injured
by
certain
of
its
parts
if
they
act
wrong
and
it
represents
their
acting
wrong
as
a
matter
of
possibility
or
accident
neither
inevitable
nor
yet
to
be
infallibly
warded
off
in
all
this
it
is
a
theory
devoid
either
of
transparency
or
of
stability
it
gives
us
a
pluralistic
restless
universe
in
which
no
single
point
of
view
can
ever
take
in
the
whole
scene
and
to
a
mind
possessed
of
the
love
of
unity
at
any
cost
it
will
no
doubt
remain
forever
inacceptable
a
friend
with
such
a
mind
once
told
me
that
the
thought
of
my
universe
made
him
sick
like
the
sight
of
the
horrible
motion
of
a
mass
of
maggots
in
their
carrion
bed
but
while
i
freely
admit
that
the
pluralism
and
the
restlessness
are
repugnant
and
irrational
in
a
certain
way
i
find
that
every
alternative
to
them
is
irrational
in
a
deeper
way
the
indeterminism
with
its
maggots
if
you
please
to
speak
so
about
it
offends
only
the
native
absolutism
of
my
intellect
an
absolutism
which
after
all
perhaps
deserves
to
be
snubbed
and
kept
in
check
but
the
determinism
with
its
necessary
carrion
to
continue
the
figure
of
speech
and
with
no
possible
maggots
to
eat
the
latter
up
violates
my
sense
of
moral
reality
through
and
through
when
for
example
i
imagine
such
carrion
as
the
brockton
murder
i
can
not
conceive
it
as
an
act
by
which
the
universe
as
a
whole
logically
and
necessarily
expresses
its
nature
without
shrinking
from
complicity
with
such
a
whole
and
i
deliberately
refuse
to
keep
on
terms
of
loyalty
with
the
universe
by
saying
blankly
that
the
murder
since
it
does
flow
from
the
nature
of
the
whole
is
not
carrion
there
are
some
instinctive
reactions
which
i
for
one
will
not
tamper
with
the
only
remaining
alternative
the
attitude
of
gnostical
romanticism
wrenches
my
personal
instincts
in
quite
as
violent
a
way
it
falsifies
the
simple
objectivity
of
their
deliverance
it
makes
the
the
murder
excites
in
me
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
it
transforms
life
from
a
tragic
reality
into
an
insincere
melodramatic
exhibition
as
foul
or
as
tawdry
as
any
one
diseased
curiosity
pleases
to
carry
it
out
and
with
its
consecration
of
the
naturaliste
state
of
mind
and
its
enthronement
of
the
baser
crew
of
parisian
among
the
eternally
indispensable
organs
by
which
the
infinite
spirit
of
things
attains
to
that
subjective
illumination
which
is
the
task
of
its
life
it
leaves
me
in
presence
of
a
sort
of
subjective
carrion
considerably
more
noisome
than
the
objective
carrion
i
called
it
in
to
take
away
no
better
a
thousand
times
than
such
systematic
corruption
of
our
moral
sanity
the
plainest
pessimism
so
that
it
be
straightforward
but
better
far
than
that
the
world
of
chance
make
as
great
an
uproar
about
chance
as
you
please
i
know
that
chance
means
pluralism
and
nothing
more
if
some
of
the
members
of
the
pluralism
are
bad
the
philosophy
of
pluralism
whatever
broad
views
it
may
deny
me
permits
me
at
least
to
turn
to
the
other
members
with
a
clean
breast
of
affection
and
an
unsophisticated
moral
sense
and
if
i
still
wish
to
think
of
the
world
as
a
totality
it
lets
me
feel
that
a
world
with
a
chance
in
it
of
being
altogether
good
even
if
the
chance
never
come
to
pass
is
better
than
a
world
with
no
such
chance
at
all
that
whose
very
notion
i
am
exhorted
and
conjured
to
banish
from
my
view
of
the
future
as
the
suicide
of
reason
concerning
it
that
is
what
just
this
the
chance
that
in
moral
respects
the
future
may
be
other
and
better
than
the
past
has
been
this
is
the
only
chance
we
have
any
motive
for
supposing
to
exist
shame
rather
on
its
repudiation
and
its
denial
for
its
presence
is
the
vital
air
which
lets
the
world
live
the
salt
which
keeps
it
sweet
and
here
i
might
legitimately
stop
having
expressed
all
i
care
to
see
admitted
by
others
but
i
know
that
if
i
do
stop
here
misapprehensions
will
remain
in
the
minds
of
some
of
you
and
keep
all
i
have
said
from
having
its
effect
so
i
judge
it
best
to
add
a
few
more
words
in
the
first
place
in
spite
of
all
my
explanations
the
word
will
still
be
giving
trouble
though
you
may
yourselves
be
adverse
to
the
deterministic
doctrine
you
wish
a
pleasanter
word
than
to
name
the
opposite
doctrine
by
and
you
very
likely
consider
my
preference
for
such
a
word
a
perverse
sort
of
a
partiality
on
my
part
it
certainly
a
bad
word
to
make
converts
with
and
you
wish
i
had
not
thrust
it
so
at
you
you
wish
to
use
a
milder
term
well
i
admit
there
may
be
just
a
dash
of
perversity
in
its
choice
the
spectacle
of
the
mere
game
played
by
the
soft
determinists
has
perhaps
driven
me
too
violently
the
other
way
and
rather
than
be
found
wrangling
with
them
for
the
good
words
i
am
willing
to
take
the
first
bad
one
which
comes
along
provided
it
be
unequivocal
the
question
is
of
things
not
of
eulogistic
names
for
them
and
the
best
word
is
the
one
that
enables
men
to
know
the
quickest
whether
they
disagree
or
not
about
the
things
but
the
word
with
its
singular
negativity
is
just
the
word
for
this
purpose
whoever
uses
it
instead
of
squarely
and
resolutely
gives
up
all
pretence
to
control
the
things
he
says
are
free
for
he
confesses
that
they
are
no
better
than
mere
chance
would
be
it
is
a
word
of
and
is
therefore
the
only
sincere
word
we
can
use
if
in
granting
freedom
to
certain
things
we
grant
it
honestly
and
really
risk
the
game
who
chooses
me
must
give
and
forfeit
all
he
hath
any
other
word
permits
of
quibbling
and
lets
us
after
the
fashion
of
the
soft
determinists
make
a
pretence
of
restoring
the
caged
bird
to
liberty
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
we
anxiously
tie
a
string
to
its
leg
to
make
sure
it
does
not
get
beyond
our
sight
but
now
you
will
bring
up
your
final
doubt
does
not
the
admission
of
such
an
unguaranteed
chance
or
freedom
preclude
utterly
the
notion
of
a
providence
governing
the
world
does
it
not
leave
the
fate
of
the
universe
at
the
mercy
of
the
and
so
far
insecure
does
it
not
in
short
deny
the
craving
of
our
nature
for
an
ultimate
peace
behind
all
tempests
for
a
blue
zenith
above
all
clouds
to
this
my
answer
must
be
very
brief
the
belief
in
is
not
in
the
least
incompatible
with
the
belief
in
providence
provided
you
do
not
restrict
the
providence
to
fulminating
nothing
but
decrees
if
you
allow
him
to
provide
possibilities
as
well
as
actualities
to
the
universe
and
to
carry
on
his
own
thinking
in
those
two
categories
just
as
we
do
ours
chances
may
be
there
uncontrolled
even
by
him
and
the
course
of
the
universe
be
really
ambiguous
and
yet
the
end
of
all
things
may
be
just
what
he
intended
it
to
be
from
all
eternity
an
analogy
will
make
the
meaning
of
this
clear
suppose
two
men
before
a
chessboard
the
one
a
novice
the
other
an
expert
player
of
the
game
the
expert
intends
to
beat
but
he
can
not
foresee
exactly
what
any
one
actual
move
of
his
adversary
may
be
he
knows
however
all
the
moves
of
the
latter
and
he
knows
in
advance
how
to
meet
each
of
them
by
a
move
of
his
own
which
leads
in
the
direction
of
victory
and
the
victory
infallibly
arrives
after
no
matter
how
devious
a
course
in
the
one
predestined
form
of
to
the
novice
king
let
now
the
novice
stand
for
us
finite
free
agents
and
the
expert
for
the
infinite
mind
in
which
the
universe
lies
suppose
the
latter
to
be
thinking
out
his
universe
before
he
actually
creates
it
suppose
him
to
say
i
will
lead
things
to
a
certain
end
but
i
will
not
decide
on
all
the
steps
thereto
at
various
points
ambiguous
possibilities
shall
be
left
open
of
which
at
a
given
instant
may
become
actual
but
whichever
branch
of
these
bifurcations
become
real
i
know
what
i
shall
do
at
the
bifurcation
to
keep
things
from
drifting
away
from
the
final
result
i
intend
the
creator
plan
of
the
universe
would
thus
be
left
blank
as
to
many
of
its
actual
details
but
all
possibilities
would
be
marked
down
the
realization
of
some
of
these
would
be
left
absolutely
to
chance
that
is
would
only
be
determined
when
the
moment
of
realization
came
other
possibilities
would
be
determined
that
is
their
decision
would
have
to
wait
till
it
was
seen
how
the
matters
of
absolute
chance
fell
out
but
the
rest
of
the
plan
including
its
final
upshot
would
be
rigorously
determined
once
for
all
so
the
creator
himself
would
not
need
to
know
the
details
of
actuality
until
they
came
and
at
any
time
his
own
view
of
the
world
would
be
a
view
partly
of
facts
and
partly
of
possibilities
exactly
as
ours
is
now
of
one
thing
however
he
might
be
certain
and
that
is
that
his
world
was
safe
and
that
no
matter
how
much
it
might
he
could
surely
bring
it
home
at
last
now
it
is
entirely
immaterial
in
this
scheme
whether
the
creator
leave
the
absolute
to
be
decided
by
himself
each
when
its
proper
moment
arrives
or
whether
on
the
contrary
he
alienate
this
power
from
himself
and
leave
the
decision
out
and
out
to
finite
creatures
such
as
we
men
are
the
great
point
is
that
the
possibilities
are
really
whether
it
be
we
who
solve
them
or
he
working
through
us
at
those
moments
when
fate
scales
seem
to
quiver
and
good
snatches
the
victory
from
evil
or
shrinks
nerveless
from
the
fight
is
of
small
account
so
long
as
we
admit
that
the
issue
is
decided
nowhere
else
than
here
and
now
is
what
gives
the
palpitating
reality
to
our
moral
life
and
makes
it
tingle
as
mallock
says
with
so
strange
and
elaborate
an
excitement
this
reality
this
excitement
are
what
the
determinisms
hard
and
soft
alike
suppress
by
their
denial
that
is
decided
here
and
now
and
their
dogma
that
all
things
were
foredoomed
and
settled
long
ago
if
it
be
so
may
you
and
i
then
have
been
foredoomed
to
the
error
of
continuing
to
believe
in
liberty
it
is
fortunate
for
the
winding
up
of
controversy
that
in
every
discussion
with
determinism
this
ad
can
be
its
adversary
last
word
an
address
to
the
harvard
divinity
students
published
in
the
unitarian
review
for
september
and
i
may
now
say
charles
peirce
see
the
monist
for
the
whole
history
of
popular
beliefs
about
nature
refutes
the
notion
that
the
thought
of
a
universal
physical
order
can
possibly
have
arisen
from
the
purely
passive
reception
and
association
of
particular
perceptions
indubitable
as
it
is
that
men
infer
from
known
cases
to
unknown
it
is
equally
certain
that
this
procedure
if
restricted
to
the
phenomenal
materials
that
spontaneously
offer
themselves
would
never
have
led
to
the
belief
in
a
general
uniformity
but
only
to
the
belief
that
law
and
lawlessness
rule
the
world
in
motley
alternation
from
the
point
of
view
of
strict
experience
nothing
exists
but
the
sum
of
particular
perceptions
with
their
coincidences
on
the
one
hand
their
contradictions
on
the
other
that
there
is
more
order
in
the
world
than
appears
at
first
sight
is
not
discovered
the
order
is
looked
the
first
impulse
to
look
for
it
proceeds
from
practical
needs
where
ends
must
be
attained
or
produce
a
result
but
the
practical
need
is
only
the
first
occasion
for
our
reflection
on
the
conditions
of
true
knowledge
and
even
were
there
no
such
need
motives
would
still
be
present
for
carrying
us
beyond
the
stage
of
mere
association
for
not
with
an
equal
interest
or
rather
with
an
equal
lack
of
interest
does
man
contemplate
those
natural
processes
in
which
a
thing
is
linked
with
its
former
mate
and
those
in
which
it
is
linked
to
something
else
former
processes
harmonize
with
the
conditions
of
his
own
the
latter
do
not
in
the
former
his
and
apply
to
reality
in
the
latter
they
have
no
such
application
and
thus
the
intellectual
satisfaction
which
at
first
comes
to
him
without
reflection
at
last
excites
in
him
the
conscious
wish
to
find
realized
throughout
the
entire
phenomenal
world
those
rational
continuities
uniformities
and
necessities
which
are
the
fundamental
element
and
guiding
principle
of
his
own
thought

speaking
technically
it
is
a
word
with

positive
denotation

a
connotation

be
silent
about

it

decide
that
point
at
the
moment
in
which
it
reveals
itself
a
favorite

against

that
if
it
be
true
a
man
murderer
may
as
probably
be
his
best
friend
as
his
worst
enemy
a
mother
be
as
likely
to
strangle
as
to
suckle
her
and
all
of
us
be
as
ready
to
jump
from
windows
as
to
go
out
of
front
doors
etc
users
of
this
argument
should
properly
be
excluded
from
debate
till
they
learn
what
the
real
question
is
does
not
say
that
everything
that
is
physically
conceivable
is
also
morally
possible
it
merely
says
that

really
our

more
than
one

really
possible
of
course
the
alternatives
that
do
thus
tempt
our
will
are
vastly
fewer
than
the
physical
possibilities
we
can
coldly
fancy
persons
really
tempted
often
do
murder
their
best
friends
mothers
do
strangle
their
people
do
jump
out
of
windows
etc
to
a
reader
who
says
he
is
satisfied
with
a
pessimism
and
has
no
objection
to
thinking
the
whole
bad

no
more
to

makes
fewer

making
them

to
look
a
little
further
before

give
up
all
hope
of
having
them
satisfied
if
however
all
he
means
is
that
the
badness
of
some
parts
does
not
prevent
his
acceptance
of
a

him
satisfaction

rather
a

just
another
way
of
whacking

and
of
denying
that

exist
just
the
point
to
be
proved
to
say
that
time
is
an
illusory
appearance
is
only
a
roundabout
manner
of
saying
there
is
no
real
plurality
and
that
the
frame
of
things
is
an
absolute
unit
admit
plurality
and
time
may
be
its
form
and
this
of
course
means
interposition
but
not
necessarily
of
the
gross
sort
our
fathers
took
such
delight
in
representing
and
which
has
so
lost
its
magic
for
us
emerson
quotes
some
eastern
sage
as
saying
that
if
evil
were
really
done
under
the
sun
the
sky
would
incontinently
shrivel
to
a
snakeskin
and
cast
it
out
in
spasms
but
says
emerson
the
spasms
of
nature
are
years
and
centuries
and
it
will
tax
man
patience
to
wait
so
long
we
may
think
of
the
reserved
possibilities
god
keeps
in
his
own
hand
under
as
invisible
and
molecular
and
slowly
a
form
as
we
please
we
may
think
of
them
as
counteracting
human
agencies
which
he
inspires
in
short
signs
and
wonders
and
convulsions
of
the
earth
and
sky
are
not
the
only
neutralizers
of
obstruction
to
a
god

it
is

the
still
small
voice
which
urges
an
opposite
course
and
thus
excuse
themselves
from
effort
in
a
quite
unanswerable
way
the
moral
philosopher
and
the
moral
life
the
main
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
show
that
there
is
no
such
thing
possible
as
an
ethical
philosophy
dogmatically
made
up
in
advance
we
all
help
to
determine
the
content
of
ethical
philosophy
so
far
as
we
contribute
to
the
race
moral
life
in
other
words
there
can
be
no
final
truth
in
ethics
any
more
than
in
physics
until
the
last
man
has
had
his
experience
and
said
his
say
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
however
the
hypotheses
which
we
now
make
while
waiting
and
the
acts
to
which
they
prompt
us
are
among
the
indispensable
conditions
which
determine
what
that
shall
be
first
of
all
what
is
the
position
of
him
who
seeks
an
ethical
philosophy
to
begin
with
he
must
be
distinguished
from
all
those
who
are
satisfied
to
be
ethical
sceptics
he
not
be
a
sceptic
therefore
so
far
from
ethical
scepticism
being
one
possible
fruit
of
ethical
philosophizing
it
can
only
be
regarded
as
that
residual
alternative
to
all
philosophy
which
from
the
outset
menaces
every
philosopher
who
may
give
up
the
quest
discouraged
and
renounce
his
original
aim
that
aim
is
to
find
an
account
of
the
moral
relations
that
obtain
among
things
which
will
weave
them
into
the
unity
of
a
stable
system
and
make
of
the
world
what
one
may
call
a
genuine
universe
from
the
ethical
point
of
view
so
far
as
the
world
resists
reduction
to
the
form
of
unity
so
far
as
ethical
propositions
seem
unstable
so
far
does
the
philosopher
fail
of
his
ideal
the
of
his
study
is
the
ideals
he
finds
existing
in
the
world
the
purpose
which
guides
him
is
this
ideal
of
his
own
of
getting
them
into
a
certain
form
this
ideal
is
thus
a
factor
in
ethical
philosophy
whose
legitimate
presence
must
never
be
overlooked
it
is
a
positive
contribution
which
the
philosopher
himself
necessarily
makes
to
the
problem
but
it
is
his
only
positive
contribution
at
the
outset
of
his
inquiry
he
ought
to
have
no
other
ideals
were
he
interested
peculiarly
in
the
triumph
of
any
one
kind
of
good
he
would
cease
to
be
a
judicial
investigator
and
become
an
advocate
for
some
limited
element
of
the
case
there
are
three
questions
in
ethics
which
must
be
kept
apart
let
them
be
called
respectively
the
question
the
question
and
the
question
the
psychological
question
asks
after
the
historical
of
our
moral
ideas
and
judgments
the
metaphysical
question
asks
what
the
very
of
the
words
and
are
the
casuistic
question
asks
what
is
the
of
the
various
goods
and
ills
which
men
recognize
so
that
the
philosopher
may
settle
the
true
order
of
human
obligations
i
the
psychological
question
is
for
most
disputants
the
only
question
when
your
ordinary
doctor
of
divinity
has
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
an
altogether
unique
faculty
called
must
be
postulated
to
tell
us
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
or
when
your
enthusiast
has
proclaimed
that
is
an
exploded
superstition
and
that
our
moral
judgments
have
gradually
resulted
from
the
teaching
of
the
environment
each
of
these
persons
thinks
that
ethics
is
settled
and
nothing
more
is
to
be
said
the
familiar
pair
of
names
intuitionist
and
evolutionist
so
commonly
used
now
to
connote
all
possible
differences
in
ethical
opinion
really
refer
to
the
psychological
question
alone
the
discussion
of
this
question
hinges
so
much
upon
particular
details
that
it
is
impossible
to
enter
upon
it
at
all
within
the
limits
of
this
paper
i
will
therefore
only
express
dogmatically
my
own
belief
which
is
this
that
the
benthams
the
mills
and
the
barns
have
done
a
lasting
service
in
taking
so
many
of
our
human
ideals
and
showing
how
they
must
have
arisen
from
the
association
with
acts
of
simple
bodily
pleasures
and
reliefs
from
pain
association
with
many
remote
pleasures
will
unquestionably
make
a
thing
significant
of
goodness
in
our
minds
and
the
more
vaguely
the
goodness
is
conceived
of
the
more
mysterious
will
its
source
appear
to
be
but
it
is
surely
impossible
to
explain
all
our
sentiments
and
preferences
in
this
simple
way
the
more
minutely
psychology
studies
human
nature
the
more
clearly
it
finds
there
traces
of
secondary
affections
relating
the
impressions
of
the
environment
with
one
another
and
with
our
impulses
in
quite
different
ways
from
those
mere
associations
of
coexistence
and
succession
which
are
practically
all
that
pure
empiricism
can
admit
take
the
love
of
drunkenness
take
bashfulness
the
terror
of
high
places
the
tendency
to
to
faint
at
the
sight
of
blood
the
susceptibility
to
musical
sounds
take
the
emotion
of
the
comical
the
passion
for
poetry
for
mathematics
or
for
metaphysics
no
one
of
these
things
can
be
wholly
explained
by
either
association
or
utility
they
other
things
that
can
be
so
explained
no
doubt
and
some
of
them
are
prophetic
of
future
utilities
since
there
is
nothing
in
us
for
which
some
use
may
not
be
found
but
their
origin
is
in
incidental
complications
to
our
cerebral
structure
a
structure
whose
original
features
arose
with
no
reference
to
the
perception
of
such
discords
and
harmonies
as
these
well
a
vast
number
of
our
moral
perceptions
also
are
certainly
of
this
secondary
and
kind
they
deal
with
directly
felt
fitnesses
between
things
and
often
fly
in
the
teeth
of
all
the
prepossessions
of
habit
and
presumptions
of
utility
the
moment
you
get
beyond
the
coarser
and
more
commonplace
moral
maxims
the
decalogues
and
poor
richard
almanacs
you
fall
into
schemes
and
positions
which
to
the
eye
of
are
fantastic
and
overstrained
the
sense
for
abstract
justice
which
some
persons
have
is
as
excentric
a
variation
from
the
point
of
view
as
is
the
passion
for
music
or
for
the
higher
philosophical
consistencies
which
consumes
the
soul
of
others
the
feeling
of
the
inward
dignity
of
certain
spiritual
attitudes
as
peace
serenity
simplicity
veracity
and
of
the
essential
vulgarity
of
others
as
querulousness
anxiety
egoistic
fussiness
are
quite
inexplicable
except
by
an
innate
preference
of
the
more
ideal
attitude
for
its
own
pure
sake
the
nobler
thing
better
and
that
is
all
that
we
can
say
of
consequences
may
truly
teach
us
what
things
are
but
what
have
consequences
to
do
with
what
is
and
if
a
man
has
shot
his
wife
paramour
by
reason
of
what
subtile
repugnancy
in
things
is
it
that
we
are
so
disgusted
when
we
hear
that
the
wife
and
the
husband
have
made
it
up
and
are
living
comfortably
together
again
or
if
the
hypothesis
were
offered
us
of
a
world
in
which
fourier
and
bellamy
and
morris
utopias
should
all
be
outdone
and
millions
kept
permanently
happy
on
the
one
simple
condition
that
a
certain
lost
soul
on
the
edge
of
things
should
lead
a
life
of
lonely
torture
what
except
a
specifical
and
independent
sort
of
emotion
can
it
be
which
would
make
us
immediately
feel
even
though
an
impulse
arose
within
us
to
clutch
at
the
happiness
so
offered
how
hideous
a
thing
would
be
its
enjoyment
when
deliberately
accepted
as
the
fruit
of
such
a
bargain
to
what
once
more
but
subtile
feelings
of
discord
can
be
due
all
these
recent
protests
against
the
entire
of
retributive
justice
i
refer
to
tolstoi
with
his
ideas
of
to
bellamy
with
his
substitution
of
oblivion
for
repentance
in
his
novel
of
heidenhain
process
to
guyau
with
his
radical
condemnation
of
the
punitive
ideal
all
these
subtileties
of
the
moral
sensibility
go
as
much
beyond
what
can
be
ciphered
out
from
the
of
association
as
the
delicacies
of
sentiment
possible
between
a
pair
of
young
lovers
go
beyond
such
precepts
of
the
to
be
observed
during
engagement
as
are
printed
in
manuals
of
social
form
no
purely
inward
forces
are
certainly
at
work
here
all
the
higher
more
penetrating
ideals
are
revolutionary
they
present
themselves
far
less
in
the
guise
of
effects
of
past
experience
than
in
that
of
probable
causes
of
future
experience
factors
to
which
the
environment
and
the
lessons
it
has
so
far
taught
as
must
learn
to
bend
this
is
all
i
can
say
of
the
psychological
question
now
in
the
last
chapter
of
a
recent
work
i
have
sought
to
prove
in
a
general
way
the
existence
in
our
thought
of
relations
which
do
not
merely
repeat
the
couplings
of
experience
our
ideals
have
certainly
many
sources
they
are
not
all
explicable
as
signifying
corporeal
pleasures
to
be
gained
and
pains
to
be
escaped
and
for
having
so
constantly
perceived
this
psychological
fact
we
must
applaud
the
intuitionist
school
whether
or
not
such
applause
must
be
extended
to
that
school
other
characteristics
will
appear
as
we
take
up
the
following
questions
the
next
one
in
order
is
the
metaphysical
question
of
what
we
mean
by
the
words
and
ii
first
of
all
it
appears
that
such
words
can
have
no
application
or
relevancy
in
a
world
in
which
no
sentient
life
exists
imagine
an
absolutely
material
world
containing
only
physical
and
chemical
facts
and
existing
from
eternity
without
a
god
without
even
an
interested
spectator
would
there
be
any
sense
in
saying
of
that
world
that
one
of
its
states
is
better
than
another
or
if
there
were
two
such
worlds
possible
would
there
be
any
rhyme
or
reason
in
calling
one
good
and
the
other
bad
good
or
bad
positively
i
mean
and
apart
from
the
fact
that
one
might
relate
itself
better
than
the
other
to
the
philosopher
private
interests
but
we
must
leave
these
private
interests
out
of
the
account
for
the
philosopher
is
a
mental
fact
and
we
are
asking
whether
goods
and
evils
and
obligations
exist
in
physical
facts
surely
there
is
no
for
good
and
evil
to
exist
in
in
a
purely
insentient
world
how
can
one
physical
fact
considered
simply
as
a
physical
fact
be
than
another
betterness
is
not
a
physical
relation
in
its
mere
material
capacity
a
thing
can
no
more
be
good
or
bad
than
it
can
be
pleasant
or
painful
good
for
what
good
for
the
production
of
another
physical
fact
do
you
say
but
what
in
a
purely
physical
universe
demands
the
production
of
that
other
fact
physical
facts
simply
or
are
and
neither
when
present
or
absent
can
they
be
supposed
to
make
demands
if
they
do
they
can
only
do
so
by
having
desires
and
then
they
have
ceased
to
be
purely
physical
facts
and
have
become
facts
of
conscious
sensibility
goodness
badness
and
obligation
must
be
somewhere
in
order
really
to
exist
and
the
first
step
in
ethical
philosophy
is
to
see
that
no
merely
inorganic
of
things
can
realize
them
neither
moral
relations
nor
the
moral
law
can
swing
their
only
habitat
can
be
a
mind
which
feels
them
and
no
world
composed
of
merely
physical
facts
can
possibly
be
a
world
to
which
ethical
propositions
apply
the
moment
one
sentient
being
however
is
made
a
part
of
the
universe
there
is
a
chance
for
goods
and
evils
really
to
exist
moral
relations
now
have
their
in
that
being
consciousness
so
far
as
he
feels
anything
to
be
good
he
it
good
it
good
for
him
and
being
good
for
him
is
absolutely
good
for
he
is
the
sole
creator
of
values
in
that
universe
and
outside
of
his
opinion
things
have
no
moral
character
at
all
in
such
a
universe
as
that
it
would
of
course
be
absurd
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
solitary
thinker
judgments
of
good
and
ill
are
true
or
not
truth
supposes
a
standard
outside
of
the
thinker
to
which
he
must
conform
but
here
the
thinker
is
a
sort
of
divinity
subject
to
no
higher
judge
let
us
call
the
supposed
universe
which
he
inhabits
a
in
such
a
moral
solitude
it
is
clear
that
there
can
be
no
outward
obligation
and
that
the
only
trouble
the
thinker
is
liable
to
have
will
be
over
the
consistency
of
his
own
several
ideals
with
one
another
some
of
these
will
no
doubt
be
more
pungent
and
appealing
than
the
rest
their
goodness
will
have
a
profounder
more
penetrating
taste
they
will
return
to
haunt
him
with
more
obstinate
regrets
if
violated
so
the
thinker
will
have
to
order
his
life
with
them
as
its
chief
determinants
or
else
remain
inwardly
discordant
and
unhappy
into
whatever
equilibrium
he
may
settle
though
and
however
he
may
straighten
out
his
system
it
will
be
a
right
system
for
beyond
the
facts
of
his
own
subjectivity
there
is
nothing
moral
in
the
world
if
now
we
introduce
a
second
thinker
with
his
likes
and
dislikes
into
the
universe
the
ethical
situation
becomes
much
more
complex
and
several
possibilities
are
immediately
seen
to
obtain
one
of
these
is
that
the
thinkers
may
ignore
each
other
attitude
about
good
and
evil
altogether
and
each
continue
to
indulge
his
own
preferences
indifferent
to
what
the
other
may
feel
or
do
in
such
a
case
we
have
a
world
with
twice
as
much
of
the
ethical
quality
in
it
as
our
moral
solitude
only
it
is
without
ethical
unity
the
same
object
is
good
or
bad
there
according
as
you
measure
it
by
the
view
which
this
one
or
that
one
of
the
thinkers
takes
nor
can
you
find
any
possible
ground
in
such
a
world
for
saying
that
one
thinker
opinion
is
more
correct
than
the
other
or
that
either
has
the
truer
moral
sense
such
a
world
in
short
is
not
a
moral
universe
but
a
moral
dualism
not
only
is
there
no
single
point
of
view
within
it
from
which
the
values
of
things
can
be
unequivocally
judged
but
there
is
not
even
a
demand
for
such
a
point
of
view
since
the
two
thinkers
are
supposed
to
be
indifferent
to
each
other
thoughts
and
acts
multiply
the
thinkers
into
a
pluralism
and
we
find
realized
for
us
in
the
ethical
sphere
something
like
that
world
which
the
antique
sceptics
conceived
of
in
which
individual
minds
are
the
measures
of
all
things
and
in
which
no
one
truth
but
only
a
multitude
of
opinions
can
be
found
but
this
is
the
kind
of
world
with
which
the
philosopher
so
long
as
he
holds
to
the
hope
of
a
philosophy
will
not
put
up
among
the
various
ideals
represented
there
must
be
he
thinks
some
which
have
the
more
truth
or
authority
and
to
these
the
others
to
yield
so
that
system
and
subordination
may
reign
here
in
the
word
the
notion
of
comes
emphatically
into
view
and
the
next
thing
in
order
must
be
to
make
its
meaning
clear
since
the
outcome
of
the
discussion
so
far
has
been
to
show
us
that
nothing
can
be
good
or
right
except
so
far
as
some
consciousness
feels
it
to
be
good
or
thinks
it
to
be
right
we
perceive
on
the
very
threshold
that
the
real
superiority
and
authority
which
are
postulated
by
the
philosopher
to
reside
in
some
of
the
opinions
and
the
really
inferior
character
which
he
supposes
must
belong
to
others
can
not
be
explained
by
any
abstract
moral
of
things
existing
antecedently
to
the
concrete
thinkers
themselves
with
their
ideals
like
the
positive
attributes
good
and
bad
the
comparative
ones
better
and
worse
must
be
in
order
to
be
real
if
one
ideal
judgment
be
objectively
better
than
another
that
betterness
must
be
made
flesh
by
being
lodged
concretely
in
some
one
actual
perception
it
can
not
float
in
the
atmosphere
for
it
is
not
a
sort
of
meteorological
phenomenon
like
the
aurora
borealis
or
the
zodiacal
light
its
is
like
the
of
the
ideals
themselves
between
which
it
obtains
the
philosopher
therefore
who
seeks
to
know
which
ideal
ought
to
have
supreme
weight
and
which
one
ought
to
be
subordinated
must
trace
the
itself
to
the
constitution
of
some
existing
consciousness
behind
which
as
one
of
the
data
of
the
universe
he
as
a
purely
ethical
philosopher
is
unable
to
go
this
consciousness
must
make
the
one
ideal
right
by
feeling
it
to
be
right
the
other
wrong
by
feeling
it
to
be
wrong
but
now
what
particular
consciousness
in
the
universe
enjoy
this
prerogative
of
obliging
others
to
conform
to
a
rule
which
it
lays
down
if
one
of
the
thinkers
were
obviously
divine
while
all
the
rest
were
human
there
would
probably
be
no
practical
dispute
about
the
matter
the
divine
thought
would
be
the
model
to
which
the
others
should
conform
but
still
the
theoretic
question
would
remain
what
is
the
ground
of
the
obligation
even
here
in
our
first
essays
at
answering
this
question
there
is
an
inevitable
tendency
to
slip
into
an
assumption
which
ordinary
men
follow
when
they
are
disputing
with
one
another
about
questions
of
good
and
bad
they
imagine
an
abstract
moral
order
in
which
the
objective
truth
resides
and
each
tries
to
prove
that
this
order
is
more
accurately
reflected
in
his
own
ideas
than
in
those
of
his
adversary
it
is
because
one
disputant
is
backed
by
this
overarching
abstract
order
that
we
think
the
other
should
submit
even
so
when
it
is
a
question
no
longer
of
two
finite
thinkers
but
of
god
and
ourselves
we
follow
our
usual
habit
and
imagine
a
sort
of
relation
which
antedates
and
overarches
the
mere
facts
and
would
make
it
right
that
we
should
conform
our
thoughts
to
god
thoughts
even
though
he
made
no
claim
to
that
effect
and
though
we
preferred
to
go
on
thinking
for
ourselves
but
the
moment
we
take
a
steady
look
at
the
question
see
not
only
that
without
a
claim
actually
made
by
some
concrete
person
there
can
be
no
obligation
but
that
there
is
some
obligation
wherever
there
is
a
claim
and
obligation
are
in
fact
coextensive
terms
they
cover
each
other
exactly
our
ordinary
attitude
of
regarding
ourselves
as
subject
to
an
overarching
system
of
moral
relations
true
themselves
is
therefore
either
an
superstition
or
else
it
must
be
treated
as
a
merely
provisional
abstraction
from
that
real
thinker
in
whose
actual
demand
upon
us
to
think
as
he
does
our
obligation
must
be
ultimately
based
in
a
philosophy
that
thinker
in
question
is
of
course
the
deity
to
whom
the
existence
of
the
universe
is
due
i
know
well
how
hard
it
is
for
those
who
are
accustomed
to
what
i
have
called
the
superstitious
view
to
realize
that
every
claim
creates
in
so
far
forth
an
obligation
we
inveterately
think
that
something
which
we
call
the
of
the
claim
is
what
gives
to
it
its
obligatory
character
and
that
this
validity
is
something
outside
of
the
claim
mere
existence
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
rains
down
upon
the
claim
we
think
from
some
sublime
dimension
of
being
which
the
moral
law
inhabits
much
as
upon
the
steel
of
the
the
influence
of
the
pole
rains
down
from
out
of
the
starry
heavens
but
again
how
can
such
an
inorganic
abstract
character
of
imperativeness
additional
to
the
imperativeness
which
is
in
the
concrete
claim
itself
take
any
demand
however
slight
which
any
creature
however
weak
may
make
ought
it
not
for
its
own
sole
sake
to
be
satisfied
if
not
prove
why
not
the
only
possible
kind
of
proof
you
could
adduce
would
be
the
exhibition
of
another
creature
who
should
make
a
demand
that
ran
the
other
way
the
only
possible
reason
there
can
be
why
any
phenomenon
ought
to
exist
is
that
such
a
phenomenon
actually
is
desired
any
desire
is
imperative
to
the
extent
of
its
amount
it
itself
valid
by
the
fact
that
it
exists
at
all
some
desires
truly
enough
are
small
desires
they
are
put
forward
by
insignificant
persons
and
we
customarily
make
light
of
the
obligations
which
they
bring
but
the
fact
that
such
personal
demands
as
these
impose
small
obligations
does
not
keep
the
largest
obligations
from
being
personal
demands
if
we
must
talk
impersonally
to
be
sure
we
can
say
that
universe
requires
exacts
or
makes
obligatory
such
or
such
an
action
whenever
it
expresses
itself
through
the
desires
of
such
or
such
a
creature
but
it
is
better
not
to
talk
about
the
universe
in
this
personified
way
unless
we
believe
in
a
universal
or
divine
consciousness
which
actually
exists
if
there
be
such
a
consciousness
then
its
demands
carry
the
most
of
obligation
simply
because
they
are
the
greatest
in
amount
but
it
is
even
then
not
that
we
should
respect
them
it
is
only
concretely
right
or
right
after
the
fact
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
actually
made
suppose
we
do
not
respect
them
as
seems
largely
to
be
the
case
in
this
queer
world
that
ought
not
to
be
we
say
that
is
wrong
but
in
what
way
is
this
fact
of
wrongness
made
more
acceptable
or
intelligible
when
we
imagine
it
to
consist
rather
in
the
laceration
of
an
ideal
order
than
in
the
disappointment
of
a
living
personal
god
do
we
perhaps
think
that
we
cover
god
and
protect
him
and
make
his
impotence
over
us
less
ultimate
when
we
back
him
up
with
this
blanket
from
which
he
may
draw
some
warmth
of
further
appeal
but
the
only
force
of
appeal
to
which
either
a
living
god
or
an
abstract
ideal
order
can
wield
is
found
in
the
ruby
vaults
of
our
own
human
hearts
as
they
happen
to
beat
responsive
and
not
irresponsive
to
the
claim
so
far
as
they
do
feel
it
when
made
by
a
living
consciousness
it
is
life
answering
to
life
a
claim
thus
livingly
acknowledged
is
acknowledged
with
a
solidity
and
fulness
which
no
thought
of
an
backing
can
render
more
complete
while
if
on
the
other
hand
the
heart
response
is
withheld
the
stubborn
phenomenon
is
there
of
an
impotence
in
the
claims
which
the
universe
embodies
which
no
talk
about
an
eternal
nature
of
things
can
gloze
over
or
dispel
an
ineffective
order
is
as
impotent
a
thing
as
an
ineffective
god
and
in
the
eye
of
philosophy
it
is
as
hard
a
thing
to
explain
we
may
now
consider
that
what
we
distinguished
as
the
metaphysical
question
in
ethical
philosophy
is
sufficiently
answered
and
that
we
have
learned
what
the
words
and
severally
mean
they
mean
no
absolute
natures
independent
of
personal
support
they
are
objects
of
feeling
and
desire
which
have
no
foothold
or
anchorage
in
being
apart
from
the
existence
of
actually
living
minds
wherever
such
minds
exist
with
judgments
of
good
and
ill
and
demands
upon
one
another
there
is
an
ethical
world
in
its
essential
features
were
all
other
things
gods
and
men
and
starry
heavens
blotted
out
from
this
universe
and
were
there
left
but
one
rock
with
two
loving
souls
upon
it
that
rock
would
have
as
thoroughly
moral
a
constitution
as
any
possible
world
which
the
eternities
and
immensities
could
harbor
it
would
be
a
tragic
constitution
because
the
inhabitants
would
die
but
while
they
lived
there
would
be
real
good
things
and
real
bad
things
in
the
universe
there
would
be
obligations
claims
and
expectations
obediences
refusals
and
disappointments
compunctions
and
longings
for
harmony
to
come
again
and
inward
peace
of
conscience
when
it
was
restored
there
would
in
short
be
a
moral
life
whose
active
energy
would
have
no
limit
but
the
intensity
of
interest
in
each
other
with
which
the
hero
and
heroine
might
be
endowed
we
on
this
terrestrial
globe
so
far
as
the
visible
facts
go
are
just
like
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
rock
whether
a
god
exist
or
whether
no
god
exist
in
yon
blue
heaven
above
us
bent
we
form
at
any
rate
an
ethical
republic
here
below
and
the
first
reflection
which
this
leads
to
is
that
ethics
have
as
genuine
and
real
a
foothold
in
a
universe
where
the
highest
consciousness
is
human
as
in
a
universe
where
there
is
a
god
as
well
religion
of
humanity
affords
a
basis
for
ethics
as
well
as
theism
does
whether
the
purely
human
system
can
gratify
the
philosopher
demand
as
well
as
the
other
is
a
different
question
which
we
ourselves
must
answer
ere
we
close
iii
the
last
fundamental
question
in
ethics
was
it
will
be
remembered
the
question
here
we
are
in
a
world
where
the
existence
of
a
divine
thinker
has
been
and
perhaps
always
will
be
doubted
by
some
of
the
and
where
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
ideals
in
which
human
beings
agree
there
are
a
mass
of
others
about
which
no
general
consensus
obtains
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
present
a
literary
picture
of
this
for
the
facts
are
too
well
known
the
wars
of
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
in
each
man
the
concupiscences
of
different
individuals
pursuing
the
same
unshareable
material
or
social
prizes
the
ideals
which
contrast
so
according
to
races
circumstances
temperaments
philosophical
beliefs
all
form
a
maze
of
apparently
inextricable
confusion
with
no
obvious
ariadne
thread
to
lead
one
out
yet
the
philosopher
just
because
he
is
a
philosopher
adds
his
own
peculiar
ideal
to
the
confusion
with
which
if
he
were
willing
to
be
a
sceptic
he
would
be
passably
content
and
insists
that
over
all
these
individual
opinions
there
is
a
of
which
he
can
discover
if
he
only
takes
sufficient
pains
we
stand
ourselves
at
present
in
the
place
of
that
philosopher
and
must
not
fail
to
realize
all
the
features
that
the
situation
comports
in
the
first
place
we
will
not
be
sceptics
we
hold
to
it
that
there
is
a
truth
to
be
ascertained
but
in
the
second
place
we
have
just
gained
the
insight
that
that
truth
can
not
be
a
set
of
laws
or
an
abstract
reason
but
can
only
exist
in
act
or
in
the
shape
of
an
opinion
held
by
some
thinker
really
to
be
found
there
is
however
no
visible
thinker
invested
with
authority
shall
we
then
simply
proclaim
our
own
ideals
as
the
lawgiving
ones
no
for
if
we
are
true
philosophers
we
must
throw
our
own
spontaneous
ideals
even
the
dearest
impartially
in
with
that
total
mass
of
ideals
which
are
fairly
to
be
judged
but
how
then
can
we
as
philosophers
ever
find
a
test
how
avoid
complete
moral
scepticism
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
escape
bringing
a
wayward
personal
standard
of
our
own
along
with
us
on
which
we
simply
pin
our
faith
the
dilemma
is
a
hard
one
nor
does
it
grow
a
bit
more
easy
as
we
revolve
it
in
our
minds
the
entire
undertaking
of
the
philosopher
obliges
him
to
seek
an
impartial
test
that
test
however
must
be
incarnated
in
the
demand
of
some
actually
existent
person
and
how
can
he
pick
out
the
person
save
by
an
act
in
which
his
own
sympathies
and
prepossessions
are
implied
one
method
indeed
presents
itself
and
has
as
a
matter
of
history
been
taken
by
the
more
serious
ethical
schools
if
the
heap
of
things
demanded
proved
on
inspection
less
chaotic
than
at
first
they
seemed
if
they
furnished
their
own
relative
test
and
measure
then
the
casuistic
problem
would
be
solved
if
it
were
found
that
all
goods
goods
contained
a
common
essence
then
the
amount
of
this
essence
involved
in
any
one
good
would
show
its
rank
in
the
scale
of
goodness
and
order
could
be
quickly
made
for
this
essence
would
be
good
upon
which
all
thinkers
were
agreed
the
relatively
objective
and
universal
good
that
the
philosopher
seeks
even
his
own
private
ideals
would
be
measured
by
their
share
of
it
and
find
their
rightful
place
among
the
rest
various
essences
of
good
have
thus
been
found
and
proposed
as
bases
of
the
ethical
system
thus
to
be
a
mean
between
two
extremes
to
be
recognized
by
a
special
intuitive
faculty
to
make
the
agent
happy
for
the
moment
to
make
others
as
well
as
him
happy
in
the
long
run
to
add
to
his
perfection
or
dignity
to
harm
no
one
to
follow
from
reason
or
flow
from
universal
law
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
god
to
promote
the
survival
of
the
human
species
on
this
planet
are
so
many
tests
each
of
which
has
been
maintained
by
somebody
to
constitute
the
essence
of
all
good
things
or
actions
so
far
as
they
are
good
no
one
of
the
measures
that
have
been
actually
proposed
has
however
given
general
satisfaction
some
are
obviously
not
universally
present
in
all
cases
the
character
of
harming
no
one
or
that
of
following
a
universal
law
for
the
best
course
is
often
cruel
and
many
acts
are
reckoned
good
on
the
sole
condition
that
they
be
exceptions
and
serve
not
as
examples
of
a
universal
law
other
characters
such
as
following
the
will
of
god
are
unascertainable
and
vague
others
again
like
survival
are
quite
indeterminate
in
their
consequences
and
leave
us
in
the
lurch
where
we
most
need
their
help
a
philosopher
of
the
sioux
nation
for
example
will
be
certain
to
use
the
in
a
very
different
way
from
ourselves
the
best
on
the
whole
of
these
marks
and
measures
of
goodness
seems
to
be
the
capacity
to
bring
happiness
but
in
order
not
to
break
down
fatally
this
test
must
be
taken
to
cover
innumerable
acts
and
impulses
that
never
at
happiness
so
that
after
all
in
seeking
for
a
universal
principle
we
inevitably
are
carried
onward
to
the
most
universal
principle
that
essence
of
good
is
simply
to
satisfy
the
demand
may
be
for
anything
under
the
sun
there
is
really
no
more
ground
for
supposing
that
all
our
demands
can
be
accounted
for
by
one
universal
underlying
kind
of
motive
than
there
is
ground
for
supposing
that
all
physical
phenomena
are
cases
of
a
single
law
the
elementary
forces
in
ethics
are
probably
as
plural
as
those
of
physics
are
the
various
ideals
have
no
common
character
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
are
ideals
no
single
abstract
principle
can
be
so
used
as
to
yield
to
the
philosopher
anything
like
a
scientifically
accurate
and
genuinely
useful
casuistic
scale
a
look
at
another
peculiarity
of
the
ethical
universe
as
we
find
it
will
still
further
show
us
the
philosopher
perplexities
as
a
purely
theoretic
problem
namely
the
casuistic
question
would
hardly
ever
come
up
at
all
if
the
ethical
philosopher
were
only
asking
after
the
best
system
of
goods
he
would
indeed
have
an
easy
task
for
all
demands
as
such
are
respectable
and
the
best
simply
imaginary
world
would
be
one
in
which
demand
was
gratified
as
soon
as
made
such
a
world
would
however
have
to
have
a
physical
constitution
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
one
which
we
inhabit
it
would
need
not
only
a
space
but
a
time
to
include
all
the
acts
and
experiences
incompatible
with
one
another
here
below
which
would
then
go
on
in
conjunction
such
as
spending
our
money
yet
growing
rich
taking
our
holiday
yet
getting
ahead
with
our
work
shooting
and
fishing
yet
doing
no
hurt
to
the
beasts
gaining
no
end
of
experience
yet
keeping
our
youthful
freshness
of
heart
and
the
like
there
can
be
no
question
that
such
a
system
of
things
however
brought
about
would
be
the
absolutely
ideal
system
and
that
if
a
philosopher
could
create
universes
and
provide
all
the
mechanical
conditions
that
is
the
sort
of
universe
which
he
should
unhesitatingly
create
but
this
world
of
ours
is
made
on
an
entirely
different
pattern
and
the
casuistic
question
here
is
most
tragically
practical
the
actually
possible
in
this
world
is
vastly
narrower
than
all
that
is
demanded
and
there
is
always
a
between
the
ideal
and
the
actual
which
can
only
be
got
through
by
leaving
part
of
the
ideal
behind
there
is
hardly
a
good
which
we
can
imagine
except
as
competing
for
the
possession
of
the
same
bit
of
space
and
time
with
some
other
imagined
good
every
end
of
desire
that
presents
itself
appears
exclusive
of
some
other
end
of
desire
shall
a
man
drink
and
smoke
keep
his
nerves
in
condition
he
can
not
do
both
shall
he
follow
his
fancy
for
amelia
for
henrietta
both
can
not
be
the
choice
of
his
heart
shall
he
have
the
dear
old
republican
party
a
spirit
of
unsophistication
in
public
affairs
he
can
not
have
both
etc
so
that
the
ethical
philosopher
demand
for
the
right
scale
of
subordination
in
ideals
is
the
fruit
of
an
altogether
practical
need
some
part
of
the
ideal
must
be
butchered
and
he
needs
to
know
which
part
it
is
a
tragic
situation
and
no
mere
speculative
conundrum
with
which
he
has
to
deal
now
we
are
blinded
to
the
real
difficulty
of
the
philosopher
task
by
the
fact
that
we
are
born
into
a
society
whose
ideals
are
largely
ordered
already
if
we
follow
the
ideal
which
is
conventionally
highest
the
others
which
we
butcher
either
die
and
do
not
return
to
haunt
us
or
if
they
come
back
and
accuse
us
of
murder
every
one
applauds
us
for
turning
to
them
a
deaf
ear
in
other
words
our
environment
encourages
us
not
to
be
philosophers
but
partisans
the
philosopher
however
can
not
so
long
as
he
clings
to
his
own
ideal
of
objectivity
rule
out
any
ideal
from
being
heard
he
is
confident
and
rightly
confident
that
the
simple
taking
counsel
of
his
own
intuitive
preferences
would
be
certain
to
end
in
a
mutilation
of
the
fulness
of
the
truth
the
poet
heine
is
said
to
have
written
in
the
place
of
in
his
copy
of
that
author
work
entitled
god
in
history
so
as
to
make
it
read
in
der
geschichte
now
with
no
disrespect
to
the
good
and
learned
baron
is
it
not
safe
to
say
that
any
single
philosopher
however
wide
his
sympathies
must
be
just
such
a
bunsen
in
der
geschichte
of
the
moral
world
so
soon
as
he
attempts
to
put
his
own
ideas
of
order
into
that
howling
mob
of
desires
each
struggling
to
get
for
the
ideal
to
which
it
clings
the
very
best
of
men
must
not
only
be
insensible
but
be
ludicrously
and
peculiarly
insensible
to
many
goods
as
a
militant
fighting
that
the
goods
to
which
he
is
sensible
may
not
be
submerged
and
lost
from
out
of
life
the
philosopher
like
every
other
human
being
is
in
a
natural
position
but
think
of
zeno
and
of
epicurus
think
of
calvin
and
of
paley
think
of
kant
and
schopenhauer
of
herbert
spencer
and
john
henry
newman
no
longer
as
champions
of
special
ideals
but
as
schoolmasters
deciding
what
all
must
think
and
what
more
grotesque
topic
could
a
satirist
wish
for
on
which
to
exercise
his
pen
the
fabled
attempt
of
partington
to
arrest
the
rising
tide
of
the
north
atlantic
with
her
broom
was
a
reasonable
spectacle
compared
with
their
effort
to
substitute
the
content
of
their
systems
for
that
exuberant
mass
of
goods
with
which
all
human
nature
is
in
travail
and
groaning
to
bring
to
the
light
of
day
think
furthermore
of
such
individual
moralists
no
longer
as
mere
schoolmasters
but
as
pontiffs
armed
with
the
temporal
power
and
having
authority
in
every
concrete
case
of
conflict
to
order
which
good
shall
be
butchered
and
which
shall
be
suffered
to
survive
and
the
notion
really
turns
one
pale
all
one
slumbering
revolutionary
instincts
waken
at
the
thought
of
any
single
moralist
wielding
such
powers
of
life
and
death
better
chaos
forever
than
an
order
based
on
any
rule
even
though
he
were
the
most
enlightened
possible
member
of
his
tribe
no
if
the
philosopher
is
to
keep
his
judicial
position
he
must
never
become
one
of
the
parties
to
the
fray
what
can
he
do
then
it
will
now
be
asked
except
to
fall
back
on
scepticism
and
give
up
the
notion
of
being
a
philosopher
at
all
but
do
we
not
already
see
a
perfectly
definite
path
of
escape
which
is
open
to
him
just
because
he
is
a
philosopher
and
not
the
champion
of
one
particular
ideal
since
everything
which
is
demanded
is
by
that
fact
a
good
must
not
the
guiding
principle
for
ethical
philosophy
since
all
demands
conjointly
can
not
be
satisfied
in
this
poor
world
be
simply
to
satisfy
at
all
times
many
demands
as
we
that
act
must
be
the
best
act
accordingly
which
makes
for
the
best
whole
in
the
sense
of
awakening
the
least
sum
of
dissatisfactions
in
the
casuistic
scale
therefore
those
ideals
must
be
written
highest
which
at
the
least
or
by
whose
realization
the
least
possible
number
of
other
ideals
are
destroyed
since
victory
and
defeat
there
must
be
the
victory
to
be
philosophically
prayed
for
is
that
of
the
more
inclusive
side
of
the
side
which
even
in
the
hour
of
triumph
will
to
some
degree
do
justice
to
the
ideals
in
which
the
vanquished
party
interests
lay
the
course
of
history
is
nothing
but
the
story
of
men
struggles
from
generation
to
generation
to
find
the
more
and
more
inclusive
order
some
of
realizing
your
own
ideals
which
will
also
satisfy
the
alien
demands
that
and
that
only
is
the
path
of
peace
following
this
path
society
has
shaken
itself
into
one
sort
of
relative
equilibrium
after
another
by
a
series
of
social
discoveries
quite
analogous
to
those
of
science
polyandry
and
polygamy
and
slavery
private
warfare
and
liberty
to
kill
judicial
torture
and
arbitrary
royal
power
have
slowly
succumbed
to
actually
aroused
complaints
and
though
some
one
ideals
are
unquestionably
the
worse
off
for
each
improvement
yet
a
vastly
greater
total
number
of
them
find
shelter
in
our
civilized
society
than
in
the
older
savage
ways
so
far
then
and
up
to
date
the
casuistic
scale
is
made
for
the
philosopher
already
far
better
than
he
can
ever
make
it
for
himself
an
experiment
of
the
most
searching
kind
has
proved
that
the
laws
and
usages
of
the
land
are
what
yield
the
maximum
of
satisfaction
to
the
thinkers
taken
all
together
the
presumption
in
cases
of
conflict
must
always
be
in
favor
of
the
conventionally
recognized
good
the
philosopher
must
be
a
conservative
and
in
the
construction
of
his
casuistic
scale
must
put
the
things
most
in
accordance
with
the
customs
of
the
community
on
top
and
yet
if
he
be
a
true
philosopher
he
must
see
that
there
is
nothing
final
in
any
actually
given
equilibrium
of
human
ideals
but
that
as
our
present
laws
and
customs
have
fought
and
conquered
other
past
ones
so
they
will
in
their
turn
be
overthrown
by
any
newly
discovered
order
which
will
hush
up
the
complaints
that
they
still
give
rise
to
without
producing
others
louder
still
rules
are
made
for
man
not
man
for
rules
that
one
sentence
is
enough
to
immortalize
green
prolegomena
to
ethics
and
although
a
man
always
risks
much
when
he
breaks
away
from
established
rules
and
strives
to
realize
a
larger
ideal
whole
than
they
permit
yet
the
philosopher
must
allow
that
it
is
at
all
times
open
to
any
one
to
make
the
experiment
provided
he
fear
not
to
stake
his
life
and
character
upon
the
throw
the
pinch
is
always
here
pent
in
under
every
system
of
moral
rules
are
innumerable
persons
whom
it
weighs
upon
and
goods
which
it
represses
and
these
are
always
rumbling
and
grumbling
in
the
background
and
ready
for
any
issue
by
which
they
may
get
free
see
the
abuses
which
the
institution
of
private
property
covers
so
that
even
it
is
shamelessly
asserted
among
us
that
one
of
the
prime
functions
of
the
national
government
is
to
help
the
adroiter
citizens
to
grow
rich
see
the
unnamed
and
unnamable
sorrows
which
the
tyranny
on
the
whole
so
beneficent
of
the
brings
to
so
many
both
of
the
married
and
the
unwed
see
the
wholesale
loss
of
opportunity
under
our
of
equality
and
industrialism
with
the
drummer
and
the
in
the
saddle
for
so
many
faculties
and
graces
which
could
flourish
in
the
feudal
world
see
our
kindliness
for
the
humble
and
the
outcast
how
it
wars
with
that
stern
which
until
now
has
been
the
condition
of
every
perfection
in
the
breed
see
everywhere
the
struggle
and
the
squeeze
and
the
problem
how
to
make
them
less
the
anarchists
nihilists
and
the
socialists
and
men
the
and
reformers
the
prohibitionists
and
the
radical
darwinians
with
their
idea
of
the
suppression
of
the
weak
these
and
all
the
conservative
sentiments
of
society
arrayed
against
them
are
simply
deciding
through
actual
experiment
by
what
sort
of
conduct
the
maximum
amount
of
good
can
be
gained
and
kept
in
this
world
these
experiments
are
to
be
judged
not
but
by
actually
finding
after
the
fact
of
their
making
how
much
more
outcry
or
how
much
appeasement
comes
about
what
can
possibly
anticipate
the
result
of
trials
made
on
such
a
scale
or
what
can
any
superficial
theorist
judgment
be
worth
in
a
world
where
every
one
of
hundreds
of
ideals
has
its
special
champion
already
provided
in
the
shape
of
some
genius
expressly
born
to
feel
it
and
to
fight
to
death
in
its
behalf
the
pure
philosopher
can
only
follow
the
windings
of
the
spectacle
confident
that
the
line
of
least
resistance
will
always
be
towards
the
richer
and
the
more
inclusive
arrangement
and
that
by
one
tack
after
another
some
approach
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
incessantly
made
iv
all
this
amounts
to
saying
that
so
far
as
the
casuistic
question
goes
ethical
science
is
just
like
physical
science
and
instead
of
being
deducible
all
at
once
from
abstract
principles
must
simply
bide
its
time
and
be
ready
to
revise
its
conclusions
from
day
to
day
the
presumption
of
course
in
both
sciences
always
is
that
the
vulgarly
accepted
opinions
are
true
and
the
right
casuistic
order
that
which
public
opinion
believes
in
and
surely
it
would
be
folly
quite
as
great
in
most
of
us
to
strike
out
independently
and
to
aim
at
originality
in
ethics
as
in
physics
every
now
and
then
however
some
one
is
born
with
the
right
to
be
original
and
his
revolutionary
thought
or
action
may
bear
prosperous
fruit
he
may
replace
old
of
nature
by
better
ones
he
may
by
breaking
old
moral
rules
in
a
certain
place
bring
in
a
total
condition
of
things
more
ideal
than
would
have
followed
had
the
rules
been
kept
on
the
whole
then
we
must
conclude
that
no
philosophy
of
ethics
is
possible
in
the
absolute
sense
of
the
term
everywhere
the
ethical
philosopher
must
wait
on
facts
the
thinkers
who
create
the
ideals
come
he
knows
not
whence
their
sensibilities
are
evolved
he
knows
not
how
and
the
question
as
to
which
of
two
conflicting
ideals
will
give
the
best
universe
then
and
there
can
be
answered
by
him
only
through
the
aid
of
the
experience
of
other
men
i
said
some
time
ago
in
treating
of
the
question
that
the
intuitional
moralists
deserve
credit
for
keeping
most
clearly
to
the
psychological
facts
they
do
much
to
spoil
this
merit
on
the
whole
however
by
mixing
with
it
that
dogmatic
temper
which
by
absolute
distinctions
and
unconditional
shalt
nots
changes
a
growing
elastic
and
continuous
life
into
a
superstitious
system
of
relics
and
dead
bones
in
point
of
fact
there
are
no
absolute
evils
and
there
are
no
goods
and
the
ethical
life
however
few
may
be
called
to
bear
its
burdens
consists
at
all
times
in
the
breaking
of
rules
which
have
grown
too
narrow
for
the
actual
case
there
is
but
one
unconditional
commandment
which
is
that
we
should
seek
incessantly
with
fear
and
trembling
so
to
vote
and
to
act
as
to
bring
about
the
very
largest
total
universe
of
good
which
we
can
see
abstract
rules
indeed
can
help
but
they
help
the
less
in
proportion
as
our
intuitions
are
more
piercing
and
our
vocation
is
the
stronger
for
the
moral
life
for
every
real
dilemma
is
in
literal
strictness
a
unique
situation
and
the
exact
combination
of
ideals
realized
and
ideals
disappointed
which
each
decision
creates
is
always
a
universe
without
a
precedent
and
for
which
no
adequate
previous
rule
exists
the
philosopher
then
philosopher
is
no
better
able
to
determine
the
best
universe
in
the
concrete
emergency
than
other
men
he
sees
indeed
somewhat
better
than
most
men
what
the
question
always
is
not
a
question
of
this
good
or
that
good
simply
taken
but
of
the
two
total
universes
with
which
these
goods
respectively
belong
he
knows
that
he
must
vote
always
for
the
richer
universe
for
the
good
which
seems
most
organizable
most
fit
to
enter
into
complex
combinations
most
apt
to
be
a
member
of
a
more
inclusive
whole
but
which
particular
universe
this
is
he
can
not
know
for
certain
in
advance
he
only
knows
that
if
he
makes
a
bad
mistake
the
cries
of
the
wounded
will
soon
inform
him
of
the
fact
in
all
this
the
philosopher
is
just
like
the
rest
of
us
so
far
as
we
are
just
and
sympathetic
instinctively
and
so
far
as
we
are
open
to
the
voice
of
complaint
his
function
is
in
fact
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
best
kind
of
statesman
at
the
present
day
his
books
upon
ethics
therefore
so
far
as
they
truly
touch
the
moral
life
must
more
and
more
ally
themselves
with
a
literature
which
is
confessedly
tentative
and
suggestive
rather
than
dogmatic
i
mean
with
novels
and
dramas
of
the
deeper
sort
with
sermons
with
books
on
statecraft
and
philanthropy
and
social
and
economical
reform
treated
in
this
way
ethical
treatises
may
be
voluminous
and
luminous
as
well
but
they
never
can
be
except
in
their
abstractest
and
vaguest
features
and
they
must
more
and
more
abandon
the
and
form
the
chief
of
all
the
reasons
why
concrete
ethics
can
not
be
final
is
that
they
have
to
wait
on
metaphysical
and
theological
beliefs
i
said
some
time
back
that
real
ethical
relations
existed
in
a
purely
human
world
they
would
exist
even
in
what
we
called
a
moral
solitude
if
the
thinker
had
various
ideals
which
took
hold
of
him
in
turn
his
self
of
one
day
would
make
demands
on
his
self
of
another
and
some
of
the
demands
might
be
urgent
and
tyrannical
while
others
were
gentle
and
easily
put
aside
we
call
the
tyrannical
demands
if
we
ignore
these
we
do
not
hear
the
last
of
it
the
good
which
we
have
wounded
returns
to
plague
us
with
interminable
crops
of
consequential
damages
compunctions
and
regrets
obligation
can
thus
exist
inside
a
single
thinker
consciousness
and
perfect
peace
can
abide
with
him
only
so
far
as
he
lives
according
to
some
sort
of
a
casuistic
scale
which
keeps
his
more
imperative
goods
on
top
it
is
the
nature
of
these
goods
to
be
cruel
to
their
rivals
nothing
shall
avail
when
weighed
in
the
balance
against
them
they
call
out
all
the
mercilessness
in
our
disposition
and
do
not
easily
forgive
us
if
we
are
so
as
to
shrink
from
sacrifice
in
their
behalf
the
deepest
difference
practically
in
the
moral
life
of
man
is
the
difference
between
the
and
the
strenuous
mood
when
in
the
mood
the
shrinking
from
present
ill
is
our
ruling
consideration
the
strenuous
mood
on
the
contrary
makes
us
quite
indifferent
to
present
ill
if
only
the
greater
ideal
be
attained
the
capacity
for
the
strenuous
mood
probably
lies
slumbering
in
every
man
but
it
has
more
difficulty
in
some
than
in
others
in
waking
up
it
needs
the
wilder
passions
to
arouse
it
the
big
fears
loves
and
indignations
or
else
the
deeply
penetrating
appeal
of
some
one
of
the
higher
fidelities
like
justice
truth
or
freedom
strong
relief
is
a
necessity
of
its
vision
and
a
world
where
all
the
mountains
are
brought
down
and
all
the
valleys
are
exalted
is
no
congenial
place
for
its
habitation
this
is
why
in
a
solitary
thinker
this
mood
might
slumber
on
forever
without
waking
his
various
ideals
known
to
him
to
be
mere
preferences
of
his
own
are
too
nearly
of
the
same
denominational
value
he
can
play
fast
or
loose
with
them
at
will
this
too
is
why
in
a
merely
human
world
without
a
god
the
appeal
to
our
moral
energy
falls
short
of
its
maximal
stimulating
power
life
to
be
sure
is
even
in
such
a
world
a
genuinely
ethical
symphony
but
it
is
played
in
the
compass
of
a
couple
of
poor
octaves
and
the
infinite
scale
of
values
fails
to
open
up
many
of
us
indeed
like
sir
james
stephen
in
those
eloquent
by
a
barrister
would
openly
laugh
at
the
very
idea
of
the
strenuous
mood
being
awakened
in
us
by
those
claims
of
remote
posterity
which
constitute
the
last
appeal
of
the
religion
of
humanity
we
do
not
love
these
men
of
the
future
keenly
enough
and
we
love
them
perhaps
the
less
the
more
we
hear
of
their
evolutionized
perfection
their
high
average
longevity
and
education
their
freedom
from
war
and
crime
their
relative
immunity
from
pain
and
zymotic
disease
and
all
their
other
negative
superiorities
this
is
all
too
finite
we
say
we
see
too
well
the
vacuum
beyond
it
lacks
the
note
of
infinitude
and
mystery
and
may
all
be
dealt
with
in
the
mood
no
need
of
agonizing
ourselves
or
making
others
agonize
for
these
good
creatures
just
at
present
when
however
we
believe
that
a
god
is
there
and
that
he
is
one
of
the
claimants
the
infinite
perspective
opens
out
the
scale
of
the
symphony
is
incalculably
prolonged
the
more
imperative
ideals
now
begin
to
speak
with
an
altogether
new
objectivity
and
significance
and
to
utter
the
penetrating
shattering
tragically
challenging
note
of
appeal
they
ring
out
like
the
call
of
victor
hugo
alpine
eagle
qui
parle
au
pr√©cipice
et
que
le
gouffre
entend
and
the
strenuous
mood
awakens
at
the
sound
it
saith
among
the
trumpets
ha
ha
it
smelleth
the
battle
afar
off
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
its
blood
is
up
and
cruelty
to
the
lesser
claims
so
far
from
being
a
deterrent
element
does
but
add
to
the
stern
joy
with
which
it
leaps
to
answer
to
the
greater
all
through
history
in
the
periodical
conflicts
of
puritanism
with
the
temper
we
see
the
antagonism
of
the
strenuous
and
genial
moods
and
the
contrast
between
the
ethics
of
infinite
and
mysterious
obligation
from
on
high
and
those
of
prudence
and
the
satisfaction
of
merely
finite
need
the
capacity
of
the
strenuous
mood
lies
so
deep
down
among
our
natural
human
possibilities
that
even
if
there
were
no
metaphysical
or
traditional
grounds
for
believing
in
a
god
men
would
postulate
one
simply
as
a
pretext
for
living
hard
and
getting
out
of
the
game
of
existence
its
keenest
possibilities
of
zest
our
attitude
towards
concrete
evils
is
entirely
different
in
a
world
where
we
believe
there
are
none
but
finite
demanders
from
what
it
is
in
one
where
we
joyously
face
tragedy
for
an
infinite
demander
sake
every
sort
of
energy
and
endurance
of
courage
and
capacity
for
handling
life
evils
is
set
free
in
those
who
have
religious
faith
for
this
reason
the
strenuous
type
of
character
will
on
the
of
human
history
always
outwear
the
type
and
religion
will
drive
irreligion
to
the
wall
it
would
seem
too
and
this
is
my
final
conclusion
that
the
stable
and
systematic
moral
universe
for
which
the
ethical
philosopher
asks
is
fully
possible
only
in
a
world
where
there
is
a
divine
thinker
with
demands
if
such
a
thinker
existed
his
way
of
subordinating
the
demands
to
one
another
would
be
the
finally
valid
casuistic
scale
his
claims
would
be
the
most
appealing
his
ideal
universe
would
be
the
most
inclusive
realizable
whole
if
he
now
exist
then
actualized
in
his
thought
already
must
be
that
ethical
philosophy
which
we
seek
as
the
pattern
which
our
own
must
evermore
approach
in
the
interests
of
our
own
ideal
of
systematically
unified
moral
truth
therefore
we
as
philosophers
must
postulate
a
divine
thinker
and
pray
for
the
victory
of
the
religious
cause
meanwhile
exactly
what
the
thought
of
the
infinite
thinker
may
be
is
hidden
from
us
even
were
we
sure
of
his
existence
so
that
our
postulation
of
him
after
all
serves
only
to
let
loose
in
us
the
strenuous
mood
but
this
is
what
it
does
in
all
men
even
those
who
have
no
interest
in
philosophy
the
ethical
philosopher
therefore
whenever
he
ventures
to
say
which
course
of
action
is
the
best
is
on
no
essentially
different
level
from
the
common
man
see
i
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
good
and
death
and
evil
therefore
choose
life
that
thou
and
thy
seed
may
live
when
this
challenge
comes
to
us
it
is
simply
our
total
character
and
personal
genius
that
are
on
trial
and
if
we
invoke
any
philosophy
our
choice
and
use
of
that
also
are
but
revelations
of
our
personal
aptitude
or
incapacity
for
moral
life
from
this
unsparing
practical
ordeal
no
professor
lectures
and
no
array
of
books
can
save
us
the
solving
word
for
the
learned
and
the
unlearned
man
alike
lies
in
the
last
resort
in
the
dumb
willingnesses
and
unwillingnesses
of
their
interior
characters
and
nowhere
else
it
is
not
in
heaven
neither
is
it
beyond
the
sea
but
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
do
it
an
address
to
the
yale
philosophical
club
published
in
the
international
journal
of
ethics
april
the
principles
of
psychology
new
york
holt
co
all
this
is
set
forth
with
great
freshness
and
force
in
the
work
of
my
colleague
professor
josiah
royce
the
religious
aspect
of
philosophy
boston
great
men
and
their
environment
a
remarkable
parallel
which
i
think
has
never
been
noticed
obtains
between
the
facts
of
social
evolution
on
the
one
hand
and
of
zo√∂logical
evolution
as
expounded
by
darwin
on
the
other
it
will
be
best
to
prepare
the
ground
for
my
thesis
by
a
few
very
general
remarks
on
the
method
of
getting
at
scientific
truth
it
is
a
common
platitude
that
a
complete
acquaintance
with
any
one
thing
however
small
would
require
a
knowledge
of
the
entire
universe
not
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
but
some
of
the
remote
conditions
of
his
fall
are
to
be
found
in
the
milky
way
in
our
federal
constitution
or
in
the
early
history
of
europe
that
is
to
say
alter
the
milky
way
alter
the
federal
constitution
alter
the
facts
of
our
barbarian
ancestry
and
the
universe
would
so
far
be
a
different
universe
from
what
it
now
is
one
fact
involved
in
the
difference
might
be
that
the
particular
little
who
threw
the
stone
which
brought
down
the
sparrow
might
not
find
himself
opposite
the
sparrow
at
that
particular
moment
or
finding
himself
there
he
might
not
be
in
that
particular
serene
and
disengaged
mood
of
mind
which
expressed
itself
in
throwing
the
stone
but
true
as
all
this
is
it
would
be
very
foolish
for
any
one
who
was
inquiring
the
cause
of
the
sparrow
fall
to
overlook
the
boy
as
too
personal
proximate
and
so
to
speak
anthropomorphic
an
agent
and
to
say
that
the
true
cause
is
the
federal
constitution
the
westward
migration
of
the
celtic
race
or
the
structure
of
the
milky
way
if
we
proceeded
on
that
method
we
might
say
with
perfect
legitimacy
that
a
friend
of
ours
who
had
slipped
on
the
ice
upon
his
and
cracked
his
skull
some
months
after
dining
with
thirteen
at
the
table
died
because
of
that
ominous
feast
i
know
in
fact
one
such
instance
and
i
might
if
i
chose
contend
with
perfect
logical
propriety
that
the
slip
on
the
ice
was
no
real
accident
there
are
no
accidents
i
might
say
for
science
the
whole
history
of
the
world
converged
to
produce
that
slip
if
anything
had
been
left
out
the
slip
would
not
have
occurred
just
there
and
then
to
say
it
would
is
to
deny
the
relations
of
cause
and
effect
throughout
the
universe
the
real
cause
of
the
death
was
not
the
slip
the
conditions
which
engendered
the
and
among
them
his
having
sat
at
a
table
six
months
previous
one
among
thirteen
is
truly
the
reason
why
he
died
within
the
year
it
will
soon
be
seen
whose
arguments
i
am
in
form
reproducing
here
i
would
fain
lay
down
the
truth
without
polemics
or
recrimination
but
unfortunately
we
never
fully
grasp
the
import
of
any
true
statement
until
we
have
a
clear
notion
of
what
the
opposite
untrue
statement
would
be
the
error
is
needed
to
set
off
the
truth
much
as
a
dark
background
is
required
for
exhibiting
the
brightness
of
a
picture
and
the
error
which
i
am
going
to
use
as
a
foil
to
set
off
what
seems
to
me
the
truth
of
my
own
statements
is
contained
in
the
philosophy
of
herbert
spencer
and
his
disciples
our
problem
is
what
are
the
causes
that
make
communities
change
from
generation
to
generation
that
make
the
england
of
queen
anne
so
different
from
the
england
of
elizabeth
the
harvard
college
of
so
different
from
that
of
thirty
years
ago
i
shall
reply
to
this
problem
the
difference
is
due
to
the
accumulated
influences
of
individuals
of
their
examples
their
initiatives
and
their
decisions
the
spencerian
school
replies
the
changes
are
irrespective
of
persons
and
independent
of
individual
control
they
are
due
to
the
environment
to
the
circumstances
the
physical
geography
the
ancestral
conditions
the
increasing
experience
of
outer
relations
to
everything
in
fact
except
the
grants
and
the
bismarcks
the
joneses
and
the
smiths
now
i
say
that
these
theorizers
are
guilty
of
precisely
the
same
fallacy
as
he
who
should
ascribe
the
death
of
his
friend
to
the
dinner
with
thirteen
or
the
fall
of
the
sparrow
to
the
milky
way
like
the
dog
in
the
fable
who
drops
his
real
bone
to
snatch
at
its
image
they
drop
the
real
causes
to
snatch
at
others
which
from
no
possible
human
point
of
view
are
available
or
attainable
their
fallacy
is
a
practical
one
let
us
see
where
it
lies
although
i
believe
in
myself
i
will
waive
that
belief
in
this
discussion
and
assume
with
the
spencerians
the
predestination
of
all
human
actions
on
that
assumption
i
gladly
allow
that
were
the
intelligence
investigating
the
man
or
the
sparrow
death
omniscient
and
omnipresent
able
to
take
in
the
whole
of
time
and
space
at
a
single
glance
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
objection
to
the
milky
way
or
the
fatal
feast
being
invoked
among
the
causes
such
a
divine
intelligence
would
see
instantaneously
all
the
infinite
lines
of
convergence
towards
a
given
result
and
it
would
moreover
see
impartially
it
would
see
the
fatal
feast
to
be
as
much
a
condition
of
the
sparrow
death
as
of
the
man
it
would
see
the
boy
with
the
stone
to
be
as
much
a
condition
of
the
man
fall
as
of
the
sparrow
the
human
mind
however
is
constituted
on
an
entirely
different
plan
it
has
no
such
power
of
universal
intuition
its
finiteness
obliges
it
to
see
but
two
or
three
things
at
a
time
if
it
wishes
to
take
wider
sweeps
it
has
to
use
ideas
as
they
are
called
and
in
so
doing
to
drop
all
concrete
truths
thus
in
the
present
case
if
we
as
men
wish
to
feel
the
connection
between
the
milky
way
and
the
boy
and
the
dinner
and
the
sparrow
and
the
man
death
we
can
do
so
only
by
falling
back
on
the
enormous
emptiness
of
what
is
called
an
abstract
proposition
we
must
say
all
things
in
the
world
are
fatally
predetermined
and
hang
together
in
the
adamantine
fixity
of
a
system
of
natural
law
but
in
the
vagueness
of
this
vast
proposition
we
have
lost
all
the
concrete
facts
and
links
and
in
all
practical
matters
the
concrete
links
are
the
only
things
of
importance
the
human
mind
is
essentially
partial
it
can
be
efficient
at
all
only
by
what
to
attend
to
and
ignoring
everything
else
by
narrowing
its
point
of
view
otherwise
what
little
strength
it
has
is
dispersed
and
it
loses
its
way
altogether
man
always
wants
his
curiosity
gratified
for
a
particular
purpose
if
in
the
case
of
the
sparrow
the
purpose
is
punishment
it
would
be
idiotic
to
wander
off
from
the
cats
boys
and
other
possible
agencies
close
by
in
the
street
to
survey
the
early
celts
and
the
milky
way
the
boy
would
meanwhile
escape
and
if
in
the
case
of
the
unfortunate
man
we
lose
ourselves
in
contemplation
of
the
mystery
and
fail
to
notice
the
ice
on
the
step
and
cover
it
with
ashes
some
other
poor
fellow
who
never
dined
out
in
his
life
may
slip
on
it
in
coming
to
the
door
and
fall
and
break
his
head
too
it
is
then
a
necessity
laid
upon
us
as
human
beings
to
limit
our
view
in
mathematics
we
know
how
this
method
of
ignoring
and
neglecting
quantities
lying
outside
of
a
certain
range
has
been
adopted
in
the
differential
calculus
the
calculator
throws
out
all
the
of
the
quantities
he
is
considering
he
treats
them
under
certain
rules
as
if
they
did
not
exist
in
themselves
they
exist
perfectly
all
the
while
but
they
are
as
if
they
did
not
exist
for
the
purposes
of
his
calculation
just
so
an
astronomer
in
dealing
with
the
tidal
movements
of
the
ocean
takes
no
account
of
the
waves
made
by
the
wind
or
by
the
pressure
of
all
the
steamers
which
day
and
night
are
moving
their
thousands
of
tons
upon
its
surface
just
so
the
marksman
in
sighting
his
rifle
allows
for
the
motion
of
the
wind
but
not
for
the
equally
real
motion
of
the
earth
and
solar
system
just
so
a
business
man
punctuality
may
overlook
an
error
of
five
minutes
while
a
physicist
measuring
the
velocity
of
light
must
count
each
thousandth
of
a
second
there
are
in
short
cycles
of
in
nature
different
departments
so
to
speak
relatively
independent
of
one
another
so
that
what
goes
on
at
any
moment
in
one
may
be
compatible
with
almost
any
condition
of
things
at
the
same
time
in
the
next
the
mould
on
the
biscuit
in
the
of
a
vegetates
in
absolute
indifference
to
the
nationality
of
the
flag
the
direction
of
the
voyage
the
weather
and
the
human
dramas
that
may
go
on
on
board
and
a
mycologist
may
study
it
in
complete
abstraction
from
all
these
larger
details
only
by
so
studying
it
in
fact
is
there
any
chance
of
the
mental
concentration
by
which
alone
he
may
hope
to
learn
something
of
its
nature
on
the
other
hand
the
captain
who
in
manoeuvring
the
vessel
through
a
naval
fight
should
think
it
necessary
to
bring
the
mouldy
biscuit
into
his
calculations
would
very
likely
lose
the
battle
by
reason
of
the
excessive
of
his
mind
the
causes
which
operate
in
these
incommensurable
cycles
are
connected
with
one
another
only
we
take
the
whole
universe
into
for
all
lesser
points
of
view
it
is
lawful
nay
more
it
is
for
human
wisdom
necessary
to
regard
them
as
disconnected
and
irrelevant
to
one
another
and
this
brings
us
nearer
to
our
special
topic
if
we
look
at
an
animal
or
a
human
being
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
his
kind
by
the
possession
of
some
extraordinary
peculiarity
good
or
bad
we
shall
be
able
to
discriminate
between
the
causes
which
originally
the
peculiarity
in
him
and
the
causes
that
it
after
it
is
produced
and
we
shall
see
if
the
peculiarity
be
one
that
he
was
born
with
that
these
two
sets
of
causes
belong
to
two
such
irrelevant
cycles
it
was
the
triumphant
originality
of
darwin
to
see
this
and
to
act
accordingly
separating
the
causes
of
production
under
the
title
of
to
spontaneous
variation
and
relegating
them
to
a
physiological
cycle
which
he
forthwith
agreed
to
ignore
altogether
he
confined
his
attention
to
the
causes
of
preservation
and
under
the
names
of
natural
selection
and
sexual
selection
studied
them
exclusively
as
functions
of
the
cycle
of
the
environment
philosophers
had
also
tried
to
establish
the
doctrine
of
descent
with
modification
but
they
all
committed
the
blunder
of
clumping
the
two
cycles
of
causation
into
one
what
preserves
an
animal
with
his
peculiarity
if
it
be
a
useful
one
they
saw
to
be
the
nature
of
the
environment
to
which
the
peculiarity
was
adjusted
the
giraffe
with
his
peculiar
neck
is
preserved
by
the
fact
that
there
are
in
his
environment
tall
trees
whose
leaves
he
can
digest
but
these
philosophers
went
further
and
said
that
the
presence
of
the
trees
not
only
maintained
an
animal
with
a
long
neck
to
browse
upon
their
branches
but
also
produced
him
they
his
neck
long
by
the
constant
striving
they
aroused
in
him
to
reach
up
to
them
the
environment
in
short
was
supposed
by
these
writers
to
mould
the
animal
by
a
kind
of
direct
pressure
very
much
as
a
seal
presses
the
wax
into
harmony
with
itself
numerous
instances
were
given
of
the
way
in
which
this
goes
on
under
our
eyes
the
exercise
of
the
forge
makes
the
right
arm
strong
the
palm
grows
callous
to
the
oar
the
mountain
air
distends
the
chest
the
chased
fox
grows
cunning
and
the
chased
bird
shy
the
arctic
cold
stimulates
the
animal
combustion
and
so
forth
now
these
changes
of
which
many
more
examples
might
be
adduced
are
at
present
distinguished
by
the
special
name
of
changes
their
peculiarity
is
that
that
very
feature
in
the
environment
to
which
the
animal
nature
grows
adjusted
itself
produces
the
adjustment
the
relation
to
use
phrase
with
its
own
efficient
cause
darwin
first
achievement
was
to
show
the
utter
insignificance
in
amount
of
these
changes
produced
by
direct
adaptation
the
immensely
greater
mass
of
changes
being
produced
by
internal
molecular
accidents
of
which
we
know
nothing
his
next
achievement
was
to
define
the
true
problem
with
which
we
have
to
deal
when
we
study
the
effects
of
the
visible
environment
on
the
animal
that
problem
is
simply
this
is
the
environment
more
likely
to
or
to
destroy
on
account
of
this
or
that
peculiarity
with
which
he
may
be
born
in
giving
the
name
of
variations
to
those
peculiarities
with
which
an
animal
is
born
darwin
does
not
for
a
moment
mean
to
suggest
that
they
are
not
the
fixed
outcome
of
natural
law
if
the
total
system
of
the
universe
be
taken
into
account
the
causes
of
these
variations
and
the
visible
environment
which
preserves
or
destroys
them
undoubtedly
do
in
some
remote
and
roundabout
way
hang
together
what
darwin
means
is
that
since
that
environment
is
a
perfectly
known
thing
and
its
relations
to
the
organism
in
the
way
of
destruction
or
preservation
are
tangible
and
distinct
it
would
utterly
confuse
our
finite
understandings
and
frustrate
our
hopes
of
science
to
mix
in
with
it
facts
from
such
a
disparate
and
incommensurable
cycle
as
that
in
which
the
variations
are
produced
this
last
cycle
is
that
of
occurrences
before
the
animal
is
born
it
is
the
cycle
of
influences
upon
ova
and
embryos
in
which
lie
the
causes
that
tip
them
and
tilt
them
towards
masculinity
or
femininity
towards
strength
or
weakness
towards
health
or
disease
and
towards
divergence
from
the
parent
type
what
are
the
causes
there
in
the
first
place
they
are
molecular
and
invisible
inaccessible
therefore
to
direct
observation
of
any
kind
secondly
their
operations
are
compatible
with
any
social
political
and
physical
conditions
of
environment
the
same
parents
living
in
the
same
environing
conditions
may
at
one
birth
produce
a
genius
at
the
next
an
idiot
or
a
monster
the
visible
external
conditions
are
therefore
not
direct
determinants
of
this
cycle
and
the
more
we
consider
the
matter
the
more
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
two
children
of
the
same
parents
are
made
to
differ
from
each
other
by
causes
as
disproportionate
to
their
ultimate
effects
as
is
the
famous
pebble
on
the
rocky
mountain
crest
which
separates
two
to
the
gulf
of
lawrence
and
the
pacific
ocean
toward
which
it
makes
them
severally
flow
the
great
mechanical
distinction
between
transitive
forces
and
discharging
forces
is
nowhere
illustrated
on
such
a
scale
as
in
physiology
almost
all
causes
there
are
forces
of
which
operate
by
simply
unlocking
energy
already
stored
up
they
are
upsetters
of
unstable
equilibria
and
the
resultant
effect
depends
infinitely
more
on
the
nature
of
the
materials
upset
than
on
that
of
the
particular
stimulus
which
joggles
them
down
galvanic
work
equal
to
unity
done
on
a
frog
nerve
will
discharge
from
the
muscle
to
which
the
nerve
belongs
mechanical
work
equal
to
seventy
thousand
and
exactly
the
same
muscular
effect
will
emerge
if
other
irritants
than
galvanism
are
employed
the
irritant
has
merely
started
or
provoked
something
which
then
went
on
of
itself
as
a
match
may
start
a
fire
which
consumes
a
whole
town
and
qualitatively
as
well
as
quantitatively
the
effect
may
be
absolutely
incommensurable
with
the
cause
we
find
this
condition
of
things
in
ail
organic
matter
chemists
are
distracted
by
the
difficulties
which
the
instability
of
albuminoid
compounds
opposes
to
their
study
two
specimens
treated
in
what
outwardly
seem
scrupulously
identical
conditions
behave
in
quite
different
ways
you
know
about
the
invisible
factors
of
fermentation
and
how
the
fate
of
a
jar
of
milk
whether
it
turn
into
a
sour
clot
or
a
mass
of
koumiss
depends
on
whether
the
lactic
acid
ferment
or
the
alcoholic
is
introduced
first
and
gets
ahead
of
the
other
in
starting
the
process
now
when
the
result
is
the
tendency
of
an
ovum
itself
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
to
tip
towards
this
direction
or
that
in
its
further
evolution
to
bring
forth
a
genius
or
a
dunce
even
as
the
passes
east
or
west
of
the
pebble
is
it
not
obvious
that
the
deflecting
cause
must
lie
in
a
region
so
recondite
and
minute
must
be
such
a
ferment
of
a
ferment
an
infinitesimal
of
so
high
an
order
that
surmise
itself
may
never
succeed
even
in
attempting
to
frame
an
image
of
it
such
being
the
case
was
not
darwin
right
to
turn
his
back
upon
that
region
altogether
and
to
keep
his
own
problem
carefully
free
from
all
entanglement
with
matters
such
as
these
the
success
of
his
work
is
a
sufficiently
affirmative
reply
and
this
brings
us
at
last
to
the
heart
of
our
subject
the
causes
of
production
of
great
men
lie
in
a
sphere
wholly
inaccessible
to
the
social
philosopher
he
must
simply
accept
geniuses
as
data
just
as
darwin
accepts
his
spontaneous
variations
for
him
as
for
darwin
the
only
problem
is
these
data
being
given
how
does
the
environment
affect
them
and
how
do
they
affect
the
environment
now
i
affirm
that
the
relation
of
the
visible
environment
to
the
great
man
is
in
the
main
exactly
what
it
is
to
the
in
the
darwinian
philosophy
it
chiefly
adopts
or
rejects
preserves
or
destroys
in
short
him
and
whenever
it
adopts
and
preserves
the
great
man
it
becomes
modified
by
his
influence
in
an
entirely
original
and
peculiar
way
he
acts
as
a
ferment
and
changes
its
constitution
just
as
the
advent
of
a
new
zo√∂logical
species
changes
the
faunal
and
floral
equilibrium
of
the
region
in
which
it
appears
we
all
recollect
darwin
famous
statement
of
the
influence
of
cats
on
the
growth
of
clover
in
their
neighborhood
we
all
have
read
of
the
effects
of
the
european
rabbit
in
new
zealand
and
we
have
many
of
us
taken
part
in
the
controversy
about
the
english
sparrow
here
whether
he
kills
most
or
drives
away
most
native
birds
just
so
the
great
man
whether
he
be
an
importation
from
without
like
clive
in
india
or
agassiz
here
or
whether
he
spring
from
the
soil
like
mahomet
or
franklin
brings
about
a
rearrangement
on
a
large
or
a
small
scale
of
the
social
relations
the
mutations
of
societies
then
from
generation
to
generation
are
in
the
main
due
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
acts
or
the
example
of
individuals
whose
genius
was
so
adapted
to
the
receptivities
of
the
moment
or
whose
accidental
position
of
authority
was
so
critical
that
they
became
ferments
initiators
of
movement
setters
of
precedent
or
fashion
centres
of
corruption
or
destroyers
of
other
persons
whose
gifts
had
they
had
free
play
would
have
led
society
in
another
direction
we
see
this
power
of
individual
initiative
exemplified
on
a
small
scale
all
about
us
and
on
a
large
scale
in
the
case
of
the
leaders
of
history
it
is
only
following
the
method
of
a
lyell
a
darwin
and
a
whitney
to
interpret
the
unknown
by
the
known
and
reckon
up
cumulatively
the
only
causes
of
social
change
we
can
directly
observe
societies
of
men
are
just
like
individuals
in
that
both
at
any
given
moment
offer
ambiguous
potentialities
of
development
whether
a
young
man
enters
business
or
the
ministry
may
depend
on
a
decision
which
has
to
be
made
before
a
certain
day
he
takes
the
place
offered
in
the
and
is
little
by
little
the
habits
the
knowledges
of
the
other
career
which
once
lay
so
near
cease
to
be
reckoned
even
among
his
possibilities
at
first
he
may
sometimes
doubt
whether
the
self
he
murdered
in
that
decisive
hour
might
not
have
been
the
better
of
the
two
but
with
the
years
such
questions
themselves
expire
and
the
old
alternative
once
so
vivid
fades
into
something
less
substantial
than
a
dream
it
is
no
otherwise
with
nations
they
may
be
committed
by
kings
and
ministers
to
peace
or
war
by
generals
to
victory
or
defeat
by
prophets
to
this
religion
or
to
that
by
various
geniuses
to
fame
in
art
science
or
industry
a
war
is
a
true
point
of
bifurcation
of
future
possibilities
whether
it
fail
or
succeed
its
declaration
must
be
the
of
new
policies
just
so
does
a
revolution
or
any
great
civic
precedent
become
a
deflecting
influence
whose
operations
widen
with
the
course
of
time
communities
obey
their
ideals
and
an
accidental
success
fixes
an
ideal
as
an
accidental
failure
blights
it
would
england
have
the
ideal
which
she
now
has
if
a
certain
boy
named
bob
clive
had
shot
himself
as
he
tried
to
do
at
madras
would
she
be
the
drifting
raft
she
is
now
in
european
affairs
if
a
frederic
the
great
had
inherited
her
throne
instead
of
a
victoria
and
if
bentham
mill
cobden
and
bright
had
all
been
born
in
prussia
england
has
no
doubt
precisely
the
same
intrinsic
value
relatively
to
the
other
nations
that
she
ever
had
there
is
no
such
fine
accumulation
of
human
material
upon
the
globe
but
in
england
the
material
has
lost
effective
form
while
in
germany
it
has
found
it
leaders
give
the
form
would
england
be
crying
forward
and
backward
at
once
as
she
does
now
i
will
not
wait
upon
i
would
wishing
to
conquer
but
not
to
fight
if
her
ideal
had
in
all
these
years
been
fixed
by
a
succession
of
statesmen
of
supremely
commanding
personality
working
in
one
direction
certainly
not
she
would
have
espoused
for
better
or
worse
either
one
course
or
another
had
bismarck
died
in
his
cradle
the
germans
would
still
be
satisfied
with
appearing
to
themselves
as
a
race
of
spectacled
and
political
herbivora
and
to
the
french
as
or
bismarck
will
showed
them
to
their
own
great
astonishment
that
they
could
play
a
far
livelier
game
the
lesson
will
not
be
forgotten
germany
may
have
many
vicissitudes
but
they
will
never
do
away
i
ween
the
marks
of
that
which
once
hath
been
of
bismarck
initiative
namely
from
to
the
fermentative
influence
of
geniuses
must
be
admitted
as
at
any
rate
one
factor
in
the
changes
that
constitute
social
evolution
the
community
evolve
in
many
ways
the
accidental
presence
of
this
or
that
ferment
decides
in
which
way
it
evolve
why
the
very
birds
of
the
forest
the
parrot
the
mino
have
the
power
of
human
speech
but
never
develop
it
of
themselves
some
one
must
be
there
to
teach
them
so
with
us
individuals
rembrandt
must
teach
us
to
enjoy
the
struggle
of
light
with
darkness
wagner
to
enjoy
peculiar
musical
effects
dickens
gives
a
twist
to
our
sentimentality
artemus
ward
to
our
humor
emerson
kindles
a
new
moral
light
within
us
but
it
is
like
columbus
egg
all
can
raise
the
flowers
now
for
all
have
got
the
seed
but
if
this
be
true
of
the
individuals
in
the
community
how
can
it
be
false
of
the
community
as
a
whole
if
shown
a
certain
way
a
community
may
take
it
if
not
it
will
never
find
it
and
the
ways
are
to
a
large
extent
indeterminate
in
advance
a
nation
may
obey
either
of
many
alternative
impulses
given
by
different
men
of
genius
and
still
live
and
be
prosperous
just
as
a
man
may
enter
either
of
many
businesses
only
the
prosperities
may
differ
in
their
type
but
the
indeterminism
is
not
absolute
not
every
fits
every
some
incompatibilities
there
are
a
given
genius
may
come
either
too
early
or
too
late
peter
the
hermit
would
now
be
sent
to
a
lunatic
asylum
john
mill
in
the
tenth
century
would
have
lived
and
died
unknown
cromwell
and
napoleon
need
their
revolutions
grant
his
civil
war
an
ajax
gets
no
fame
in
the
day
of
rifles
and
to
express
differently
an
instance
which
spencer
uses
what
could
a
watt
have
effected
in
a
tribe
which
no
precursive
genius
had
taught
to
smelt
iron
or
to
turn
a
lathe
now
the
important
thing
to
notice
is
that
what
makes
a
certain
genius
now
incompatible
with
his
surroundings
is
usually
the
fact
that
some
previous
genius
of
a
different
strain
has
warped
the
community
away
from
the
sphere
of
his
possible
effectiveness
after
voltaire
no
peter
the
hermit
after
charles
ix
and
louis
no
general
protestantization
of
france
after
a
manchester
school
a
beaconsfield
success

transient
after
a
philip
a
castelar
makes
little
headway
and
so
on
each
bifurcation
cuts
off
certain
sides
of
the
field
altogether
and
limits
the
future
possible
angles
of
deflection
a
community
is
a
living
thing
and
in
words
which
i
can
do
no
better
than
quote
from
professor
clifford
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
living
things
not
merely
that
they
change
under
the
influence
of
surrounding
circumstances
but
that
any
change
which
takes
place
in
them
is
not
lost
but
retained
and
as
it
were
built
into
the
organism
to
serve
as
the
foundation
for
future
actions
if
you
cause
any
distortion
in
the
growth
of
a
tree
and
make
it
crooked
whatever
you
may
do
afterwards
to
make
the
tree
straight
the
mark
of
your
distortion
is
there
it
is
absolutely
indelible
it
has
become
part
of
the
tree
nature
suppose
however
that
you
take
a
lump
of
gold
melt
it
and
let
it
cool
no
one
can
tell
by
examining
a
piece
of
gold
how
often
it
has
been
melted
and
cooled
in
geologic
ages
or
even
in
the
last
year
by
the
hand
of
man
any
one
who
cuts
down
an
oak
can
tell
by
the
rings
in
its
trunk
how
many
times
winter
has
frozen
it
into
widowhood
and
how
many
times
summer
has
warmed
it
into
life
a
living
being
must
always
contain
within
itself
the
history
not
merely
of
its
own
existence
but
of
all
its
ancestors
every
painter
can
tell
us
how
each
added
line
deflects
his
picture
in
a
certain
sense
whatever
lines
follow
must
be
built
on
those
first
laid
down
every
author
who
starts
to
rewrite
a
piece
of
work
knows
how
impossible
it
becomes
to
use
any
of
the
pages
again
the
new
beginning
has
already
excluded
the
possibility
of
those
earlier
phrases
and
transitions
while
it
has
at
the
same
time
created
the
possibility
of
an
indefinite
set
of
new
ones
no
one
of
which
however
is
completely
determined
in
advance
just
so
the
social
surroundings
of
the
past
and
present
hour
exclude
the
possibility
of
accepting
certain
contributions
from
individuals
but
they
do
not
positively
define
what
contributions
shall
be
accepted
for
in
themselves
they
are
powerless
to
fix
what
the
nature
of
the
individual
offerings
shall
be
thus
social
evolution
is
a
resultant
of
the
interaction
of
two
wholly
distinct
factors
the
individual
deriving
his
peculiar
gifts
from
the
play
of
physiological
and
forces
but
bearing
all
the
power
of
initiative
and
origination
in
his
hands
and
second
the
social
environment
with
its
power
of
adopting
or
rejecting
both
him
and
his
gifts
both
factors
are
essential
to
change
the
community
stagnates
without
the
impulse
of
the
individual
the
impulse
dies
away
without
the
sympathy
of
the
community
all
this
seems
nothing
more
than
all
who
wish
to
see
it
developed
by
a
man
of
genius
should
read
that
golden
little
work
bagehot
physics
and
politics
in
which
it
seems
to
me
the
complete
sense
of
the
way
in
which
concrete
things
grow
and
change
is
as
livingly
present
as
the
straining
after
a
of
evolution
is
livingly
absent
but
there
are
never
wanting
minds
to
whom
such
views
seem
personal
and
contracted
and
allied
to
an
anthropomorphism
long
exploded
in
other
fields
of
knowledge
the
individual
withers
and
the
world
is
more
and
more
to
these
writers
and
in
a
buckle
a
draper
and
a
taine
we
all
know
how
much
the
has
come
to
be
almost
synonymous
with
the
we
all
know
too
how
the
controversy
has
been
kept
up
between
the
partisans
of
a
of
history
and
those
who
deny
the
existence
of
anything
like
necessary
where
human
societies
are
concerned
spencer
at
the
opening
of
his
study
of
sociology
makes
an
onslaught
on
the
theory
of
history
from
which
a
few
passages
may
be
quoted
the
genesis
of
societies
by
the
action
of
great
men
may
be
comfortably
believed
so
long
as
resting
in
general
notions
you
do
not
ask
for
particulars
but
now
if
dissatisfied
with
vagueness
we
demand
that
our
ideas
shall
be
brought
into
focus
and
exactly
defined
we
discover
the
hypothesis
to
be
utterly
incoherent
if
not
stopping
at
the
explanation
of
social
progress
as
due
to
the
great
man
we
go
back
a
step
and
ask
whence
comes
the
great
man
we
find
that
the
theory
breaks
down
completely
the
question
has
two
conceivable
answers
his
origin
is
supernatural
or
it
is
natural
is
his
origin
supernatural
then
he
is
a
deputy
god
and
we
have
theocracy
once
removed
or
rather
not
removed
at
all
is
this
an
unacceptable
solution
then
the
origin
of
the
great
man
is
natural
and
immediately
this
is
recognized
he
must
be
classed
with
all
other
phenomena
in
the
society
that
gave
him
birth
as
a
product
of
its
antecedents
along
with
the
whole
generation
of
which
he
forms
a
minute
part
along
with
its
institutions
language
knowledge
manners
and
its
multitudinous
arts
and
appliances
he
is
a
you
must
admit
that
the
genesis
of
the
great
man
depends
on
the
long
series
of
complex
influences
which
has
produced
the
race
in
which
he
appears
and
the
social
state
into
which
that
race
has
slowly
grown
before
he
can
remake
his
society
his
society
must
make
him
all
those
changes
of
which
he
is
the
proximate
initiator
have
their
chief
causes
in
the
generations
he
descended
from
if
there
is
to
be
anything
like
a
real
explanation
of
those
changes
it
must
be
sought
in
that
aggregate
of
conditions
out
of
which
both
he
and
they
have
arisen
now
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
something
which
one
might
almost
call
impudent
in
the
attempt
which
spencer
makes
in
the
first
sentence
of
this
extract
to
pin
the
reproach
of
vagueness
upon
those
who
believe
in
the
power
of
initiative
of
the
great
man
suppose
i
say
that
the
singular
moderation
which
now
distinguishes
social
political
and
religious
discussion
in
england
and
contrasts
so
strongly
with
the
bigotry
and
dogmatism
of
sixty
years
ago
is
largely
due
to
mill
example
i
may
possibly
be
wrong
about
the
facts
but
i
am
at
any
rate
for
particulars
and
not
in
general
notions
and
if
spencer
should
tell
me
it
started
from
no
personal
influence
whatever
but
from
the
of
conditions
the
mill
and
all
his
contemporaries
from
the
whole
past
order
of
nature
in
short
surely
he
not
i
would
be
the
person
with
vagueness
the
fact
is
that
spencer
sociological
method
is
identical
with
that
of
one
who
would
invoke
the
zodiac
to
account
for
the
fall
of
the
sparrow
and
the
thirteen
at
table
to
explain
the
gentleman
death
it
is
of
little
more
scientific
value
than
the
oriental
method
of
replying
to
whatever
question
arises
by
the
unimpeachable
truism
god
is
great
to
fall
back
on
the
gods
where
a
proximate
principle
may
be
found
has
with
us
westerners
long
since
become
the
sign
of
an
efficient
as
distinguished
from
an
inefficient
intellect
to
believe
that
the
cause
of
everything
is
to
be
found
in
its
antecedents
is
the
the
initial
postulate
not
the
goal
and
consummation
of
science
if
she
is
simply
to
lead
us
out
of
the
labyrinth
by
the
same
hole
we
went
in
by
three
or
four
thousand
years
ago
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
have
followed
her
through
the
darkness
at
all
if
anything
is
humanly
certain
it
is
that
the
great
man
society
properly
so
called
does
not
make
him
before
he
can
remake
it
physiological
forces
with
which
the
social
political
geographical
and
to
a
great
extent
anthropological
conditions
have
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
to
do
as
the
condition
of
the
crater
of
vesuvius
has
to
do
with
the
flickering
of
this
gas
by
which
i
write
are
what
make
him
can
it
be
that
spencer
holds
the
convergence
of
sociological
pressures
to
have
so
impinged
on
about
the
of
april
that
a
shakespeare
with
all
his
mental
peculiarities
had
to
be
born
there
as
the
pressure
of
water
outside
a
certain
boat
will
cause
a
stream
of
a
certain
form
to
ooze
into
a
particular
leak
and
does
he
mean
to
say
that
if
the
aforesaid
shakespeare
had
died
of
cholera
infantum
another
mother
at
would
needs
have
engendered
a
duplicate
copy
of
him
to
restore
the
sociologic
equilibrium
just
as
the
same
stream
of
water
will
reappear
no
matter
how
often
you
pass
a
sponge
over
the
leak
so
long
as
the
outside
level
remains
unchanged
or
might
the
substitute
arise
at
here
as
elsewhere
it
is
very
hard
in
the
midst
of
spencer
vagueness
to
tell
what
he
does
mean
at
all
we
have
however
in
his
disciple
grant
allen
one
who
leaves
us
in
no
doubt
whatever
of
his
precise
meaning
this
widely
informed
suggestive
and
brilliant
writer
published
last
year
a
couple
of
articles
in
the
gentleman
magazine
in
which
he
maintained
that
individuals
have
no
initiative
in
determining
social
change
the
differences
between
one
nation
and
another
whether
in
intellect
commerce
art
morals
or
general
temperament
ultimately
depend
not
upon
any
mysterious
properties
of
race
nationality
or
any
other
unknown
and
unintelligible
abstractions
but
simply
and
solely
upon
the
physical
circumstances
to
which
they
are
exposed
if
it
be
a
fact
as
we
know
it
to
be
that
the
french
nation
differs
recognizably
from
the
chinese
and
the
people
of
hamburg
differ
recognizably
from
the
people
of
timbuctoo
then
the
notorious
and
conspicuous
differences
between
them
are
wholly
due
to
the
geographical
position
of
the
various
races
if
the
people
who
went
to
hamburg
had
gone
to
timbuctoo
they
would
now
be
indistinguishable
from
the
negroes
who
inhabit
that
central
african
metropolis
and
if
the
people
who
went
to
timbuctoo
had
gone
to
hamburg
they
would
now
have
been
merchants
driving
a
roaring
trade
in
imitation
sherry
and
indigestible
port
the
differentiating
agency
must
be
sought
in
the
great
permanent
geographical
features
of
land
and
sea
these
have
necessarily
and
inevitably
moulded
the
characters
and
histories
of
every
nation
upon
the
earth
we
can
not
regard
any
nation
as
an
active
agent
in
differentiating
itself
only
the
surrounding
circumstances
can
have
any
effect
in
such
a
direction
these
two
sentences
dogmatically
deny
the
existence
of
the
relatively
independent
physiological
cycle
of
causation
to
suppose
otherwise
is
to
suppose
that
the
mind
of
man
is
exempt
from
the
universal
law
of
causation
there
is
no
caprice
no
spontaneous
impulse
in
human
endeavors
even
tastes
and
inclinations
themselves
be
the
result
of
surrounding
causes
elsewhere
allen
writing
of
the
greek
culture
says
it
was
absolutely
and
unreservedly
the
product
of
the
geographical
hellas
acting
upon
the
given
factor
of
the
undifferentiated
aryan
brain
to
me
it
seems
a
proposition
that
nothing
whatsoever
can
differentiate
one
body
of
men
from
another
except
the
physical
conditions
in
which
they
are
set
including
of
course
under
the
term
the
relations
of
place
and
time
in
which
they
stand
with
regard
to
other
bodies
of
men
to
suppose
otherwise
is
to
deny
the
primordial
law
of
causation
to
imagine
that
the
mind
can
differentiate
itself
is
to
imagine
that
it
can
be
differentiated
without
a
cause
this
outcry
about
the
law
of
universal
causation
being
undone
the
moment
we
refuse
to
invest
in
the
kind
of
causation
which
is
peddled
round
by
a
particular
school
makes
one
impatient
these
writers
have
no
imagination
of
alternatives
with
them
there
is
no
between
outward
environment
and
miracle
caesar
aut
spencerism
catechism
if
by
conditions
allen
means
what
he
does
mean
the
outward
cycle
of
visible
nature
and
man
his
assertion
is
simply
physiologically
false
for
a
national
mind
differentiates
whenever
a
genius
is
born
in
its
midst
by
causes
acting
in
the
invisible
and
molecular
cycle
but
if
allen
means
by
conditions
the
whole
of
nature
his
assertion
though
true
forms
but
the
vague
asiatic
profession
of
belief
in
an
fate
which
certainly
need
not
plume
itself
on
any
specially
advanced
or
scientific
character
and
how
can
a
thinker
so
clever
as
allen
fail
to
have
distinguished
in
these
matters
between
conditions
and
conditions
of
a
given
result
the
french
say
that
to
have
an
omelet
we
must
break
our
eggs
that
is
the
breaking
of
eggs
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
omelet
but
is
it
a
sufficient
condition
does
an
omelet
appear
whenever
three
eggs
are
broken
so
of
the
greek
mind
to
get
such
versatile
intelligence
it
may
be
that
such
commercial
dealings
with
the
world
as
the
geographical
hellas
afforded
are
a
necessary
condition
but
if
they
are
a
sufficient
condition
why
did
not
the
phoenicians
outstrip
the
greeks
in
intelligence
no
geographical
environment
can
produce
a
given
type
of
mind
it
can
only
foster
and
further
certain
types
fortuitously
produced
and
thwart
and
frustrate
others
once
again
its
function
is
simply
selective
and
determines
what
shall
actually
be
only
by
destroying
what
is
positively
incompatible
an
arctic
environment
is
incompatible
with
improvident
habits
in
its
denizens
but
whether
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
region
shall
unite
with
their
thrift
the
peacefulness
of
the
eskimo
or
the
pugnacity
of
the
norseman
is
so
far
as
the
climate
is
concerned
an
accident
evolutionists
should
not
forget
that
we
all
have
five
fingers
not
because
four
or
six
would
not
do
just
as
well
but
merely
because
the
first
vertebrate
above
the
fishes
to
have
that
number
he
owed
his
prodigious
success
in
founding
a
line
of
descent
to
some
entirely
other
quality
we
know
not
which
but
the
inessential
five
fingers
were
taken
in
tow
and
preserved
to
the
present
day
so
of
most
social
peculiarities
which
of
them
shall
be
taken
in
tow
by
the
few
qualities
which
the
environment
necessarily
exacts
is
a
matter
of
what
physiological
accidents
shall
happen
among
individuals
allen
promises
to
prove
his
thesis
in
detail
by
the
examples
of
china
india
england
rome
etc
i
have
not
the
smallest
hesitation
in
predicting
that
he
will
do
no
more
with
these
examples
than
he
has
done
with
hellas
he
will
appear
upon
the
scene
after
the
fact
and
show
that
the
quality
developed
by
each
race
was
naturally
enough
not
incompatible
with
its
habitat
but
he
will
utterly
fail
to
show
that
the
particular
form
of
compatibility
fallen
into
in
each
case
was
the
one
necessary
and
only
possible
form
naturalists
know
well
enough
how
indeterminate
the
harmonies
between
a
fauna
and
its
environment
are
an
animal

better
his
chances
of

in
either
of
many
ways

arboreal

slimy

more

or
in
other
ways

and
any
one
of
these
ways
may
suit
him
to
many
widely
different
environments
readers
of
wallace
will
well
remember
the
striking
illustrations
of
this
in
his
malay
archipelago
borneo
closely
resembles
new
guinea
not
only
in
its
vast
size
and
its
freedom
from
volcanoes
but
in
its
variety
of
geological
structure
its
uniformity
of
climate
and
the
general
aspect
of
the
forest
vegetation
that
clothes
its
surface
the
moluccas
are
the
counterpart
of
the
philippines
in
their
volcanic
structure
their
extreme
fertility
their
luxuriant
forests
and
their
frequent
earthquakes
and
bali
with
the
east
end
of
java
has
a
climate
almost
as
dry
and
a
soil
almost
as
arid
as
that
of
timor
yet
between
these
corresponding
groups
of
islands
constructed
as
it
were
after
the
same
pattern
subjected
to
the
same
climate
and
bathed
by
the
same
oceans
there
exists
the
greatest
possible
contrast
when
we
compare
their
animal
productions
nowhere
does
the
ancient
doctrine
that
differences
or
similarities
in
the
various
forms
of
life
that
inhabit
different
countries
are
due
to
corresponding
physical
differences
or
similarities
in
the
countries
themselves
meet
with
so
direct
and
palpable
a
contradiction
borneo
and
new
guinea
as
alike
physically
as
two
distinct
countries
can
be
are
zo√∂logically
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
while
australia
with
its
dry
winds
its
open
plains
its
stony
deserts
and
its
temperate
climate
yet
produces
birds
and
quadrupeds
which
are
closely
related
to
those
inhabiting
the
hot
damp
luxuriant
forests
which
everywhere
clothe
the
plains
and
mountains
of
new
guinea
here
we
have
similar
environments
harmonizing
with
widely
differing
animal
lives
and
similar
animal
lives
harmonizing
with
widely
differing
geographical
environments
a
singularly
accomplished
writer
gryzanowski
in
the
north
american
review
uses
the
instances
of
sardinia
and
corsica
in
support
of
this
thesis
with
great
effect
he
says
these
sister
islands
lying
in
the
very
centre
of
the
mediterranean
at
almost
equal
distances
from
the
centres
of
latin
and
civilization
within
easy
reach
of
the
phoenician
the
greek
and
the
saracen
with
a
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
endowed
with
obvious
and
tempting
advantages
and
hiding
untold
sources
of
agricultural
and
mineral
wealth
have
nevertheless
remained
unknown
unheeded
and
certainly
uncared
for
during
the
thirty
centuries
of
european
history
these
islands
have
dialects
but
no
language
records
of
battles
but
no
history
they
have
customs
but
no
laws
the
but
no
justice
they
have
wants
and
wealth
but
no
commerce
timber
and
ports
but
no
shipping
they
have
legends
but
no
poetry
beauty
but
no
art
and
twenty
years
ago
it
could
still
be
said
that
they
had
universities
but
no
students
that
sardinia
with
all
her
emotional
and
picturesque
barbarism
has
never
produced
a
single
artist
is
almost
as
strange
as
her
barbarism
itself
near
the
focus
of
european
civilization
in
the
very
spot
which
an
geographer
would
point
out
as
the
most
favorable
place
for
material
and
intellectual
commercial
and
political
development
these
strange
sister
islands
have
slept
their
secular
sleep
like
on
the
of
history
this
writer
then
goes
on
to
compare
sardinia
and
sicily
with
some
detail
all
the
material
advantages
are
in
favor
of
sardinia
and
the
sardinian
population
being
of
an
ancestry
more
mixed
than
that
of
the
english
race
would
justify
far
higher
expectations
than
that
of
sicily
yet
sicily
past
history
has
been
brilliant
in
the
extreme
and
her
commerce
is
great
gryzanowski
has
his
own
theory
of
the
historic
torpor
of
these
favored
isles
he
thinks
they
stagnated
because
they
never
gained
political
autonomy
being
always
owned
by
some
continental
power
i
will
not
dispute
the
theory
but
i
will
ask
why
did
they
not
gain
it
and
answer
immediately
simply
because
no
individuals
were
born
there
with
patriotism
and
ability
enough
to
inflame
their
countrymen
with
national
pride
ambition
and
thirst
for
independent
life
corsicans
and
sardinians
are
probably
as
good
stuff
as
any
of
their
neighbors
but
the
best
will
not
blaze
till
a
torch
is
applied
and
the
appropriate
torches
seem
to
have
been
wanting
sporadic
great
men
come
everywhere
but
for
a
community
to
get
vibrating
through
and
through
with
intensely
active
life
many
geniuses
coming
together
and
in
rapid
succession
are
required
this
is
why
great
epochs
are
so
rare
why
the
sudden
bloom
of
a
greece
an
early
rome
a
renaissance
is
such
a
mystery
blow
must
follow
blow
so
fast
that
no
cooling
can
occur
in
the
intervals
then
the
mass
of
the
nation
grows
incandescent
and
may
continue
to
glow
by
pure
inertia
long
after
the
originators
of
its
internal
movement
have
passed
away
we
often
hear
surprise
expressed
that
in
these
high
tides
of
human
affairs
not
only
the
people
should
be
filled
with
stronger
life
but
that
individual
geniuses
should
seem
so
exceptionally
abundant
this
mystery
is
just
about
as
deep
as
the
conundrum
as
to
why
great
rivers
flow
by
great
towns
it
is
true
that
great
public
fermentations
awaken
and
adopt
many
geniuses
who
in
more
torpid
times
would
have
had
no
chance
to
work
but
over
and
above
this
there
must
be
an
exceptional
concourse
of
genius
about
a
time
to
make
the
fermentation
begin
at
all
the
unlikeliness
of
the
concourse
is
far
greater
than
the
unlikeliness
of
any
particular
genius
hence
the
rarity
of
these
periods
and
the
exceptional
aspect
which
they
always
wear
it
is
folly
then
to
speak
of
the
of
history
as
of
something
inevitable
which
science
has
only
to
discover
and
whose
consequences
any
one
can
then
foretell
but
do
nothing
to
alter
or
avert
why
the
very
laws
of
physics
are
conditional
and
deal
with
the
physicist
does
not
say
the
water
will
boil
anyhow
he
only
says
it
will
boil
if
a
fire
be
kindled
beneath
it
and
so
the
utmost
the
student
of
sociology
can
ever
predict
is
that
a
genius
of
a
certain
sort
show
the
way
society
will
be
sure
to
follow
it
might
long
ago
have
been
predicted
with
great
confidence
that
both
italy
and
germany
would
reach
a
stable
unity
if
some
one
could
but
succeed
in
starting
the
process
it
could
not
have
been
predicted
however
that
the
in
each
case
would
be
subordination
to
a
paramount
state
rather
than
federation
because
no
historian
could
have
calculated
the
freaks
of
birth
and
fortune
which
gave
at
the
same
moment
such
positions
of
authority
to
three
such
peculiar
individuals
as
napoleon
bismarck
and
cavour
so
of
our
own
politics
it
is
certain
now
that
the
movement
of
the
independents
reformers
or
whatever
one
please
to
call
them
will
triumph
but
whether
it
do
so
by
converting
the
republican
party
to
its
ends
or
by
rearing
a
new
party
on
the
ruins
of
both
our
present
factions
the
historian
can
not
say
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
reform
movement
would
make
more
progress
in
one
year
with
an
adequate
personal
leader
than
as
now
in
ten
without
one
were
there
a
great
citizen
splendid
with
every
civic
gift
to
be
its
candidate
who
can
doubt
that
he
would
lead
us
to
victory
but
at
present
we
his
environment
who
sigh
for
him
and
would
so
gladly
preserve
and
adopt
him
if
he
came
can
neither
move
without
him
nor
yet
do
anything
to
bring
him
forth
to
conclude
the
evolutionary
view
of
history
when
it
denies
the
vital
importance
of
individual
initiative
is
then
an
utterly
vague
and
unscientific
conception
a
lapse
from
modern
scientific
determinism
into
the
most
ancient
oriental
fatalism
the
lesson
of
the
analysis
that
we
have
made
even
on
the
completely
deterministic
hypothesis
with
which
we
started
forms
an
appeal
of
the
most
stimulating
sort
to
the
energy
of
the
individual
even
the
dogged
resistance
of
the
reactionary
conservative
to
changes
which
he
can
not
hope
entirely
to
defeat
is
justified
and
shown
to
be
effective
he
retards
the
movement
deflects
it
a
little
by
the
concessions
he
extracts
gives
it
a
resultant
momentum
compounded
of
his
inertia
and
his
speed
and
keeps
up
in
short
a
constant
lateral
pressure
which
to
be
sure
never
heads
it
round
about
but
brings
it
up
at
last
at
a
goal
far
to
the
right
or
left
of
that
to
which
it
would
have
drifted
had
he
allowed
it
to
drift
alone
i
now
pass
to
the
last
division
of
my
subject
the
function
of
the
environment
in
evolution
after
what
i
have
already
said
i
may
be
quite
concise
here
if
anywhere
it
would
seem
at
first
sight
as
if
that
school
must
be
right
which
makes
the
mind
passively
plastic
and
the
environment
actively
productive
of
the
form
and
order
of
its
conceptions
which
in
a
word
thinks
that
all
mental
progress
must
result
from
a
series
of
adaptive
changes
in
the
sense
already
defined
of
that
word
we
know
what
a
vast
part
of
our
mental
furniture
consists
of
purely
remembered
not
reasoned
experience
the
entire
field
of
our
habits
and
associations
by
contiguity
belongs
here
the
entire
field
of
those
abstract
conceptions
which
were
taught
us
with
the
language
into
which
we
were
born
belongs
here
also
and
more
than
this
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
order
of
experienced
by
the
individual
may
itself
determine
the
order
in
which
the
general
characters
imbedded
therein
shall
be
noticed
and
extracted
by
his
mind
the
pleasures
and
benefits
moreover
which
certain
parts
of
the
environment
yield
and
the
pains
and
hurts
which
other
parts
inflict
determine
the
direction
of
our
interest
and
our
attention
and
so
decide
at
which
points
the
accumulation
of
mental
experiences
shall
begin
it
might
accordingly
seem
as
if
there
were
no
room
for
any
other
agency
than
this
as
if
the
distinction
we
have
found
so
useful
between
variation
as
the
producer
of
changed
forms
and
the
environment
as
their
preserver
and
destroyer
did
not
hold
in
the
case
of
mental
progress
as
if
in
a
word
the
parallel
with
darwinism
might
no
longer
obtain
and
spencer
might
be
quite
right
with
his
fundamental
law
of
intelligence
which
says
the
cohesion
between
psychical
states
is
proportionate
to
the
frequency
with
which
the
relation
between
the
answering
external
phenomena
has
been
repeated
in
experience
but
in
spite
of
all
these
facts
i
have
no
hesitation
whatever
in
holding
firm
to
the
darwinian
distinction
even
here
i
maintain
that
the
facts
in
question
are
all
drawn
from
the
lower
strata
of
the
mind
so
to
speak
from
the
sphere
of
its
least
evolved
functions
from
the
region
of
intelligence
which
man
possesses
in
common
with
the
brutes
and
i
can
easily
show
that
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
those
mental
departments
which
are
highest
which
are
most
characteristically
human
spencer
law
is
violated
at
every
step
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
new
conceptions
emotions
and
active
tendencies
which
evolve
are
originally
produced
in
the
shape
of
random
images
fancies
accidental
of
spontaneous
variation
in
the
functional
activity
of
the
excessively
instable
human
brain
which
the
outer
environment
simply
confirms
or
refutes
adopts
or
rejects
preserves
or
destroys
selects
in
short
just
as
it
selects
morphological
and
social
variations
due
to
molecular
accidents
of
an
analogous
sort
it
is
one
of
the
tritest
of
truisms
that
human
intelligences
of
a
simple
order
are
very
literal
they
are
slaves
of
habit
doing
what
they
have
been
taught
without
variation
dry
prosaic
and
in
their
remarks
devoid
of
humor
except
of
the
coarse
physical
kind
which
rejoices
in
a
practical
joke
taking
the
world
for
granted
and
possessing
in
their
faithfulness
and
honesty
the
single
gift
by
which
they
are
sometimes
able
to
warm
us
into
admiration
but
even
this
faithfulness
seems
to
have
a
sort
of
inorganic
ring
and
to
remind
us
more
of
the
immutable
properties
of
a
piece
of
inanimate
matter
than
of
the
steadfastness
of
a
human
will
capable
of
alternative
choice
when
we
descend
to
the
brutes
all
these
peculiarities
are
intensified
no
reader
of
schopenhauer
can
forget
his
frequent
allusions
to
the
of
dogs
and
horses
nor
to
their
and
every
noticer
of
their
ways
must
receive
a
deep
impression
of
the
fatally
literal
character
of
the
few
simple
and
operations
of
their
minds
but
turn
to
the
highest
order
of
minds
and
what
a
change
instead
of
thoughts
of
concrete
things
patiently
following
one
another
in
a
beaten
track
of
habitual
suggestion
we
have
the
most
abrupt
and
transitions
from
one
idea
to
another
the
most
rarefied
abstractions
and
discriminations
the
most
combinations
of
elements
the
subtlest
associations
of
analogy
in
a
word
we
seem
suddenly
introduced
into
a
seething
caldron
of
ideas
where
everything
is
fizzling
and
bobbing
about
in
a
state
of
bewildering
activity
where
partnerships
can
be
joined
or
loosened
in
an
instant
treadmill
routine
is
unknown
and
the
unexpected
seems
the
only
law
according
to
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
individual
the
scintillations
will
have
one
character
or
another
they
will
be
sallies
of
wit
and
humor
they
will
be
flashes
of
poetry
and
eloquence
they
will
be
constructions
of
dramatic
fiction
or
of
mechanical
device
logical
or
philosophic
abstractions
business
projects
or
scientific
hypotheses
with
trains
of
experimental
consequences
based
thereon
they
will
be
musical
sounds
or
images
of
plastic
beauty
or
picturesqueness
or
visions
of
moral
harmony
but
whatever
their
differences
may
be
they
will
all
agree
in
this
that
their
genesis
is
sudden
and
as
it
were
spontaneous
that
is
to
say
the
same
premises
would
not
in
the
mind
of
another
individual
have
engendered
just
that
conclusion
although
when
the
conclusion
is
offered
to
the
other
individual
he
may
thoroughly
accept
and
enjoy
it
and
envy
the
brilliancy
of
him
to
whom
it
first
occurred
to
professor
jevons
is
due
the
great
credit
of
having
emphatically
pointed
out
how
the
genius
of
discovery
depends
altogether
on
the
number
of
these
random
notions
and
guesses
which
visit
the
investigator
mind
to
be
fertile
in
hypotheses
is
the
first
requisite
and
to
be
willing
to
throw
them
away
the
moment
experience
contradicts
them
is
the
next
the
baconian
method
of
collating
tables
of
instances
may
be
a
useful
aid
at
certain
times
but
one
might
as
well
expect
a
chemist
to
write
down
the
name
of
the
body
analyzed
or
a
weather
table
to
sum
itself
up
into
a
prediction
of
probabilities
of
its
own
accord
as
to
hope
that
the
mere
fact
of
mental
confrontation
with
a
certain
series
of
facts
will
be
sufficient
to
make
brain
conceive
their
law
the
conceiving
of
the
law
is
a
spontaneous
variation
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
it
flashes
out
of
one
brain
and
no
other
because
the
instability
of
that
brain
is
such
as
to
tip
and
upset
itself
in
just
that
particular
direction
but
the
important
thing
to
notice
is
that
the
good
flashes
and
the
bad
flashes
the
triumphant
hypotheses
and
the
absurd
conceits
are
on
an
exact
equality
in
respect
of
their
origin
aristotle
absurd
physics
and
his
immortal
logic
flow
from
one
source
the
forces
that
produce
the
one
produce
the
other
when
walking
along
the
street
thinking
of
the
blue
sky
or
the
fine
spring
weather
i
may
either
smile
at
some
grotesque
whim
which
occurs
to
me
or
i
may
suddenly
catch
an
intuition
of
the
solution
of
a
problem
which
at
that
moment
was
far
from
my
thoughts
both
notions
are
shaken
out
of
the
same
reservoir
the
reservoir
of
a
brain
in
which
the
reproduction
of
images
in
the
relations
of
their
outward
persistence
or
frequency
has
long
ceased
to
be
the
dominant
law
but
to
the
thought
when
it
is
once
engendered
the
consecration
of
agreement
with
outward
relations
may
come
the
conceit
perishes
in
a
moment
and
is
forgotten
the
scientific
hypothesis
arouses
in
me
a
fever
of
desire
for
verification
i
read
write
experiment
consult
experts
everything
corroborates
my
notion
which
being
then
published
in
a
book
spreads
from
review
to
review
and
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
at
last
there
is
no
doubt
i
am
enshrined
in
the
pantheon
of
the
great
diviners
of
nature
ways
the
environment
the
conception
which
it
was
unable
to
in
any
brain
less
idiosyncratic
than
my
own
now
the
spontaneous
upsettings
of
brains
this
way
and
that
at
particular
moments
into
particular
ideas
and
combinations
are
matched
by
their
equally
spontaneous
permanent
tiltings
or
saggings
towards
determinate
directions
the
humorous
bent
is
quite
characteristic
the
sentimental
one
equally
so
and
the
personal
tone
of
each
mind
which
makes
it
more
alive
to
certain
classes
of
experience
than
others
more
attentive
to
certain
impressions
more
open
to
certain
reasons
is
equally
the
result
of
that
invisible
and
unimaginable
play
of
the
forces
of
growth
within
the
nervous
system
which
irresponsibly
to
the
environment
makes
the
brain
peculiarly
apt
to
function
in
a
certain
way
here
again
the
selection
goes
on
the
products
of
the
mind
with
the
determined
aesthetic
bent
please
or
displease
the
community
we
adopt
wordsworth
and
grow
unsentimental
and
serene
we
are
fascinated
by
schopenhauer
and
learn
from
him
the
true
luxury
of
woe
the
adopted
bent
becomes
a
ferment
in
the
community
and
alters
its
tone
the
alteration
may
be
a
benefit
or
a
misfortune
for
it
is
allen
a
differentiation
from
within
which
has
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
larger
environment
selective
power
civilized
languedoc
taking
the
tone
of

prussia

taking
the
tone

itself
in
the
most
signal
way
to
its
environment
in
spencer
in
one
of
the
strangest
chapters
of
his
psychology
tries
to
show
the
necessary
order
in
which
the
development
of
conceptions
in
the
human
race
occurs
no
abstract
conception
can
be
developed
according
to
him
until
the
outward
experiences
have
reached
a
certain
degree
of
heterogeneity
definiteness
coherence
and
so
forth
thus
the
belief
in
an
unchanging
order
the
belief
in
is
a
belief
of
which
the
primitive
man
is
absolutely
incapable
experiences
such
as
he
receives
furnish
but
few
data
for
the
conception
of
uniformity
whether
as
displayed
in
things
or
in
relations
the
daily
impressions
which
the
savage
gets
yield
the
notion
very
imperfectly
and
in
but
few
cases
of
all
the
objects
around
trees
stones
hills
pieces
of
water
clouds
and
so
forth
most
differ
widely
and
few
approach
complete
likeness
so
nearly
as
to
make
discrimination
difficult
even
between
animals
of
the
same
species
it
rarely
happens
that
whether
alive
or
dead
they
are
presented
in
just
the
same
attitudes
it
is
only
along
with
a
gradual
development
of
the
arts
that
there
come
frequent
experiences
of
perfectly
straight
lines
admitting
of
complete
apposition
bringing
the
perceptions
of
equality
and
inequality
still
more
devoid
is
savage
life
of
the
experiences
which
generate
the
conception
of
the
uniformity
of
succession
the
sequences
observed
from
hour
to
hour
and
day
to
day
seem
anything
but
uniform
difference
is
a
far
more
conspicuous
trait
among
them
so
that
if
we
contemplate
primitive
human
life
as
a
whole
we
see
that
multiformity
of
sequence
rather
than
uniformity
is
the
notion
which
it
tends
to
generate
only
as
fast
as
the
practice
of
the
arts
develops
the
idea
of
measure
can
the
consciousness
of
uniformity
become
clear
those
conditions
furnished
by
advancing
civilization
which
make
possible
the
notion
of
uniformity
simultaneously
make
possible
the
notion
of
hence
the
primitive
man
has
little
experience
which
cultivates
the
consciousness
of
what
we
call
how
closely
allied
this
is
to
the
consciousness
which
the
practice
of
the
arts
cultivates
is
implied
even
in
language
we
speak
of
a
true
surface
as
well
as
a
true
statement
exactness
describes
perfection
in
a
mechanical
fit
as
well
as
perfect
agreement
between
the
results
of
calculations
the
whole
burden
of
spencer
book
is
to
show
the
fatal
way
in
which
the
mind
supposed
passive
is
moulded
by
its
experiences
of
relations
in
this
chapter
the
the
balance
the
chronometer
and
other
machines
and
instruments
come
to
figure
among
the
external
to
the
mind
surely
they
are
so
after
they
have
been
manufactured
but
only
because
of
the
preservative
power
of
the
social
environment
originally
all
these
things
and
all
other
institutions
were
flashes
of
genius
in
an
individual
head
of
which
the
outer
environment
showed
no
sign
adopted
by
the
race
and
become
its
heritage
they
then
supply
instigations
to
new
geniuses
whom
they
environ
to
make
new
inventions
and
discoveries
and
so
the
ball
of
progress
rolls
but
take
out
the
geniuses
or
alter
their
idiosyncrasies
and
what
increasing
uniformities
will
the
environment
show
we
defy
spencer
or
any
one
else
to
reply
the
plain
truth
is
that
the
of
evolution
as
distinguished
from
our
special
information
about
particular
cases
of
change
is
a
metaphysical
creed
and
nothing
else
it
is
a
mood
of
contemplation
an
emotional
attitude
rather
than
a
system
of
thought
a
mood
which
is
old
as
the
world
and
which
no
refutation
of
any
one
incarnation
of
it
such
as
the
spencerian
philosophy
will
dispel
the
mood
of
fatalistic
pantheism
with
its
intuition
of
the
one
and
all
which
was
and
is
and
ever
shall
be
and
from
whose
womb
each
single
thing
proceeds
far
be
it
from
us
to
speak
slightingly
here
of
so
hoary
and
mighty
a
style
of
looking
on
the
world
as
this
what
we
at
present
call
scientific
discoveries
had
nothing
to
do
with
bringing
it
to
birth
nor
can
one
easily
conceive
that
they
should
ever
give
it
its
no
matter
how
logically
incompatible
with
its
spirit
the
ultimate
phenomenal
distinctions
which
science
accumulates
should
turn
out
to
be
it
can
laugh
at
the
phenomenal
distinctions
on
which
science
is
based
for
it
draws
its
vital
breath
from
a
region
which
whether
above
or
below
is
at
least
altogether
different
from
that
in
which
science
dwells
a
critic
however
who
can
not
disprove
the
truth
of
the
metaphysic
creed
can
at
least
raise
his
voice
in
protest
against
its
disguising
itself
in
plumes
i
think
that
all
who
have
had
the
patience
to
follow
me
thus
far
will
agree
that
the
spencerian
of
social
and
intellectual
progress
is
an
obsolete
anachronism
reverting
to
a
type
of
thought
just
as
the
spencerian
philosophy
of
effacing
all
the
previous
distinctions
between
actual
and
potential
energy
momentum
work
force
mass
which
physicists
have
with
so
much
agony
achieved
carries
us
back
to
a
age

darwin
theory
of
pangenesis
is
it
is
true
an
attempt
to
account
among
other
things
for
variation
but
it
occupies
its
own
separate
place
and
its
author
no
more
invokes
the
environment
when
he
talks
of
the
adhesions
of
gemmules
than
he
invokes
these
adhesions
when
he
talks
of
the
relations
of
the
whole
animal
to
the
environment
et
impera
it
is
true
that
it
remodels
him
also
to
some
degree
by
its
educative
influence
and
that
this
constitutes
a
considerable
difference
between
the

the

of

of

i
am
well
aware
that
in
much
that
follows
though
in
nothing
that
precedes
i
seem
to
be
crossing
the
heavily
shotted
bows
of
galton
for
whose
laborious
investigations
into
the
heredity
of
genius
i
have
the
greatest
respect
galton
inclines
to
think
that
genius
of
intellect
and
passion
is
bound
to
express
itself
whatever
the
outward
opportunity
and
that
within
any
given
race
an
equal
number
of
geniuses
of
each
grade
must
needs
be
born
in
every
equal
period
of
time
a
subordinate
race
can
not
possibly
engender
a
large
number
of
geniuses
etc
he
would
i
suspect
infer
the
suppositions
i
go
on
to
make
of
great
men
fortuitously
assembling
around
a
given
epoch
and
making
it
great
and
of
their
being
fortuitously
absent
from
certain
places
and
times
from
sardinia
from
boston
now
etc
to
be
radically
vicious
i
hardly
think
however
that
he
does
justice
to
the
great
complexity
of
the
conditions
of
greatness
and
to
the
way
in
which
the
physiological
averages
of
production
may
be
masked
entirely
during
long
periods
either
by
the
accidental
mortality
of
geniuses
in
infancy
or
by
the
fact
that
the
particular
geniuses
born
happened
not
to
find
tasks
i
doubt
the
truth
of
his
assertion
that
genius
like
murder
out
it
is
true
that
certain
types
are
irrepressible
voltaire
shelley
carlyle
can
hardly
be
conceived
leading
a
dumb
and
vegetative
life
in
any
epoch
but
take
galton
himself
take
his
cousin
darwin
and
take
spencer
nothing
is
to
me
more
have
died
all
their
music
in
them
known
only
to
their
friends
as
persons
of
strong
and
original
character
and
judgment
what
has
started
them
on
their
career
of
effective
greatness
is
simply
the
accident
of
each
stumbling
upon
a
task
vast
brilliant
and
congenial
enough
to
call
out
the
convergence
of
all
his
passions
and
powers
i
see
no
more
reason
why
in
case
they
had
not
fallen
in
with
their
several
hobbies
at
propitious
periods
in
their
life
they
need
necessarily
have
hit
upon
other
hobbies
and
made
themselves
equally
great
their
case
seems
similar
to
that
of
the
washingtons
cromwells
and
grants
who
simply
rose
to
their
occasions
but
apart
from
these
causes
of
fallacy
i
am
strongly
disposed
to
think
that
where
transcendent
geniuses
are
concerned
the
numbers
anyhow
are
so
small
that
their
appearance
will
not
fit
into
any
scheme
of
averages
that
is
two
or
three
might
appear
together
just
as
the
two
or
three
balls
nearest

might
be
fired
consecutively

longer
epochs

more

the
great

would
on
the

be
more
spread
out

to
a

extent

who
can
doubt
that
if
he
had
certain
other
qualities
which
he
has
not
yet
shown
his
influence
would
have
been
still
more
decisive
that
is
if
a
certain
general
character
be
rapidly
repeated
in
our
outer
experience
with
a
number
of
strongly
contrasted
concomitants
it
will
be

abstracted

if
its

are

the
importance
of
individuals
the
previous
essay
on
great
men
called
forth
two
replies
one
by
grant
allen
entitled
the
of
genius
in
the
atlantic
monthly
vol
xlvii
the
other
entitled
and
hero
worship
by
john
fiske
the
article
which
follows
is
a
rejoinder
to
allen
article
it
was
refused
at
the
time
by
the
atlantic
but
saw
the
day
later
in
the
open
court
for
august
it
appears
here
as
a
natural
supplement
to
the
foregoing
article
on
which
it
casts
some
explanatory
light
allen
contempt
for
is
based
on
very
simple
considerations
a
nation
great
men
he
says
are
but
slight
deviations
from
the
general
level
the
hero
is
merely
a
special
complex
of
the
ordinary
qualities
of
his
race
the
petty
differences
impressed
upon
ordinary
greek
minds
by
plato
or
aristotle
or
zeno
are
nothing
at
all
compared
with
the
vast
differences
between
every
greek
mind
and
every
egyptian
or
chinese
mind
we
may
neglect
them
in
a
philosophy
of
history
just
as
in
calculating
the
impetus
of
a
locomotive
we
neglect
the
extra
impetus
given
by
a
single
piece
of
better
coal
what
each
man
adds
is
but
an
infinitesimal
fraction
compared
with
what
he
derives
from
his
parents
or
indirectly
from
his
earlier
ancestry
and
if
what
the
past
gives
to
the
hero
is
so
much
bulkier
than
what
the
future
receives
from
him
it
is
what
really
calls
for
philosophical
treatment
the
problem
for
the
sociologist
is
as
to
what
produces
the
average
man
the
extraordinary
men
and
what
they
produce
may
by
the
philosophers
be
taken
for
granted
as
too
trivial
variations
to
merit
deep
inquiry
now
as
i
wish
to
vie
with
allen
unrivalled
polemic
amiability
and
be
as
conciliatory
as
possible
i
will
not
cavil
at
his
facts
or
try
to
magnify
the
chasm
between
an
aristotle
a
goethe
or
a
napoleon
and
the
average
level
of
their
respective
tribes
let
it
be
as
small
as
allen
thinks
all
that
i
object
to
is
that
he
should
think
the
mere
of
a
difference
is
capable
of
deciding
whether
that
difference
be
or
be
not
a
fit
subject
for
philosophic
study
truly
enough
the
details
vanish
in
the
view
but
so
does
the
view
vanish
in
the
details
which
is
the
right
point
of
view
for
philosophic
vision
nature
gives
no
reply
for
both
points
of
view
being
equally
real
are
equally
natural
and
no
one
natural
reality
is
any
more
emphatic
than
any
other
accentuation
foreground
and
background
are
created
solely
by
the
interested
attention
of
the
and
if
the
small
difference
between
the
genius
and
his
tribe
interests
me
most
while
the
large
one
between
that
tribe
and
another
tribe
interests
allen
our
controversy
can
not
be
ended
until
a
complete
philosophy
accounting
for
all
differences
impartially
shall
justify
us
both
an
unlearned
carpenter
of
my
acquaintance
once
said
in
my
hearing
there
is
very
little
difference
between
one
man
and
another
but
what
little
there
is
very
this
distinction
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
it
is
not
only
the
size
of
the
difference
which
concerns
the
philosopher
but
also
its
place
and
its
kind
an
inch
is
a
small
thing
but
we
know
the
proverb
about
an
inch
on
a
man
nose
allen
and
spencer
in
inveighing
against
are
thinking
exclusively
of
the
size
of
the
inch
i
as
a
attend
to
its
seat
and
function
now
there
is
a
striking
law
over
which
few
people
seem
to
have
pondered
it
is
this
that
among
all
the
differences
which
exist
the
only
ones
that
interest
us
strongly
are
those
do
not
take
for
we
are
not
a
bit
elated
that
our
friend
should
have
two
hands
and
the
power
of
speech
and
should
practise
the
human
virtues
and
quite
as
little
are
we
vexed
that
our
dog
goes
on
all
fours
and
fails
to
understand
our
conversation
expecting
no
more
from
the
latter
companion
and
no
less
from
the
former
we
get
what
we
expect
and
are
satisfied
we
never
think
of
communing
with
the
dog
by
discourse
of
philosophy
or
with
the
friend
by
or
the
throwing
of
crusts
to
be
snapped
at
but
if
either
dog
or
friend
fall
above
or
below
the
expected
standard
they
arouse
the
most
lively
emotion
on
our
brother
vices
or
genius
we
never
weary
of
descanting
to
his
bipedism
or
his
hairless
skin
we
do
not
consecrate
a
thought
he
says
may
transport
us
that
he
is
able
to
speak
at
all
leaves
us
stone
cold
the
reason
of
all
this
is
that
his
virtues
and
vices
and
utterances
might
compatibly
with
the
current
range
of
variation
in
our
tribe
be
just
the
opposites
of
what
they
are
while
his
zo√∂logically
human
attributes
can
not
possibly
go
astray
there
is
thus
a
zone
of
insecurity
in
human
affairs
in
which
all
the
dramatic
interest
lies
the
rest
belongs
to
the
dead
machinery
of
the
stage
this
is
the
formative
zone
the
part
not
yet
ingrained
into
the
race
average
not
yet
a
typical
hereditary
and
constant
factor
of
the
social
community
in
which
it
occurs
it
is
like
the
soft
layer
beneath
the
bark
of
the
tree
in
which
all
the
year
growth
is
going
on
life
has
abandoned
the
mighty
trunk
inside
which
stands
inert
and
belongs
almost
to
the
inorganic
world
layer
after
layer
of
human
perfection
separates
me
from
the
central
africans
who
pursued
stanley
with
cries
of
meat
meat
this
vast
difference
ought
on
principles
to
rivet
my
attention
far
more
than
the
petty
one
which
obtains
between
two
such
birds
of
a
feather
as
allen
and
myself
yet
while
i
never
feel
proud
that
the
sight
of
a
awakens
in
me
no
cannibalistic
waterings
of
the
mouth
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
shall
feel
very
proud
if
i
do
not
publicly
appear
inferior
to
allen
in
the
conduct
of
this
momentous
debate
to
me
as
a
teacher
the
intellectual
gap
between
my
ablest
and
my
dullest
student
counts
for
infinitely
more
than
that
between
the
latter
and
the
amphioxus
indeed
i
never
thought
of
the
latter
chasm
till
this
moment
will
allen
seriously
say
that
this
is
all
human
folly
and
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
to
a
veddah
eyes
the
differences
between
two
white
literary
men
seem
slight
indeed
same
clothes
same
spectacles
same
harmless
disposition
same
habit
of
scribbling
on
paper
and
poring
over
books
etc
just
two
white
fellows
the
veddah
will
say
with
no
perceptible
difference
but
what
a
difference
to
the
literary
men
themselves
think
allen
of
confounding
our
philosophies
together
merely
because
both
are
printed
in
the
same
magazines
and
are
indistinguishable
to
the
eye
of
a
veddah
our
flesh
creeps
at
the
thought
but
in
judging
of
history
allen
deliberately
prefers
to
place
himself
at
the
veddah
point
of
view
and
to
see
things
and
out
of
focus
rather
than
minutely
it
is
quite
true
that
there
are
things
and
differences
enough
to
be
seen
either
way
but
which
are
the
humanly
important
ones
those
most
worthy
to
arouse
our
interest
the
large
distinctions
or
the
small
in
the
answer
to
this
question
lies
the
whole
divergence
of
the
from
the
sociologists
as
i
said
at
the
outset
it
is
merely
a
quarrel
of
emphasis
and
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
state
my
personal
reasons
for
the
emphasis
i
prefer
the
zone
of
the
individual
differences
and
of
the
social
which
by
common
confession
they
initiate
is
the
zone
of
formative
processes
the
dynamic
belt
of
quivering
uncertainty
the
line
where
past
and
future
meet
it
is
the
theatre
of
all
we
do
not
take
for
granted
the
stage
of
the
living
drama
of
life
and
however
narrow
its
scope
it
is
roomy
enough
to
lodge
the
whole
range
of
human
passions
the
sphere
of
the
race
average
on
the
contrary
no
matter
how
large
it
may
be
is
a
dead
and
stagnant
thing
an
achieved
possession
from
which
all
insecurity
has
vanished
like
the
trunk
of
a
tree
it
has
been
built
up
by
successive
concretions
of
successive
active
zones
the
moving
present
in
which
we
live
with
its
problems
and
passions
its
individual
rivalries
victories
and
defeats
will
soon
pass
over
to
the
majority
and
leave
its
small
deposit
on
this
static
mass
to
make
room
for
fresh
actors
and
a
newer
play
and
though
it
may
be
true
as
spencer
predicts
that
each
later
zone
shall
fatally
be
narrower
than
its
forerunners
and
that
when
the
ultimate
elysium
of
the
data
of
ethics
shall
prevail
such
questions
as
the
breaking
of
eggs
at
the
large
or
the
small
end
will
span
the
whole
scope
of
possible
human
warfare
still
even
in
this
shrunken
and
enfeebled
generation
aetatis
defessa
what
eagerness
there
will
be
battles
and
defeats
will
occur
the
victors
will
be
glorified
and
the
vanquished
dishonored
just
as
in
the
brave
days
of
yore
the
human
heart
still
withdrawing
itself
from
the
much
it
has
in
safe
possession
and
concentrating
all
its
passion
upon
those
evanescent
possibilities
of
fact
which
still
quiver
in
fate
scale
and
is
not
its
instinct
right
do
not
we
here
grasp
the
the
and
catch
the
only
glimpse
it
is
allotted
to
us
to
attain
of
the
working
units
themselves
of
whose
differentiating
action
the
form
but
the
stagnant
sum
what
strange
inversion
of
scientific
procedure
does
allen
practise
when
he
teaches
us
to
neglect
elements
and
attend
only
to
aggregate
resultants
on
the
contrary
simply
because
the
active
ring
whatever
its
bulk
i
hold
that
the
study
of
its
conditions
be
these
never
so
is
the
highest
of
topics
for
the
social
philosopher
if
individual
variations
determine
its
ups
and
downs
and
escapes
and
twists
and
turns
as
allen
and
fiske
both
admit
heaven
forbid
us
from
tabooing
the
study
of
these
in
favor
of
the
average
on
the
contrary
let
us
emphasize
these
and
the
importance
of
these
and
in
picking
out
from
history
our
heroes
and
communing
with
their
kindred
spirits
in
imagining
as
strongly
as
possible
what
differences
their
individualities
brought
about
in
this
world
while
its
surface
was
still
plastic
in
their
hands
and
what
whilom
feasibilities
they
made
impossible
each
one
of
us
may
best
fortify
and
inspire
what
creative
energy
may
lie
in
his
own
soul
this
is
the
lasting
justification
of
and
the
of
it
by
is
the
excuse
for
popular
indifference
to
their
general
laws
and
averages
the
difference
between
an
america
rescued
by
a
washington
or
by
a
may
as
allen
says
be
but
it
is
in
the
words
of
my
carpenter
friend
some
organizing
genius
must
in
the
nature
of
things
have
emerged
from
the
french
revolution
but
what
frenchman
will
affirm
it
to
have
been
an
accident
of
no
consequence
that
he
should
have
had
the
supernumerary
idiosyncrasies
of
a
bonaparte
what
animal
domestic
or
wild
will
call
it
a
matter
of
no
moment
that
scarce
a
word
of
sympathy
with
brutes
should
have
survived
from
the
teachings
of
jesus
of
nazareth
the
preferences
of
sentient
creatures
are
what
the
importance
of
topics
they
are
the
absolute
and
ultimate
here
and
i
for
my
part
can
not
but
consider
the
talk
of
the
contemporary
sociological
school
about
averages
and
general
laws
and
predetermined
tendencies
with
its
obligatory
undervaluing
of
the
importance
of
individual
differences
as
the
most
pernicious
and
immoral
of
fatalisms
suppose
there
is
a
social
equilibrium
fated
to
be
whose
is
it
to
be
that
of
your
preference
or
mine
there
lies
the
question
of
questions
and
it
is
one
which
no
study
of
averages
can
decide
tarde
book
itself
a
work
of

les

√©tude

√©dition
paris
alcan
is
the
best
possible
commentary
on
this
text
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
being
for
this
author
the
two
sole
factors
of
social
change
on
some
hegelisms
we
are
just
now
witnessing
a
singular
phenomenon
in
british
and
american
philosophy
hegelism
so
defunct
on
its
native
soil
that
i
believe
but
a
single
youthful
disciple
of
the
school
is
to
be
counted
among
the
and
younger
professors
of
germany
and
whose
older
champions
are
all
passing
off
the
stage
has
found
among
us
so
zealous
and
able
a
set
of
propagandists
that
it
may
really
be
reckoned
one
of
the
most
powerful
influences
of
the
time
in
the
higher
walks
of
thought
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
as
a
movement
of
reaction
against
the
traditional
british
empiricism
the
hegelian
influence
represents
expansion
and
freedom
and
is
doing
service
of
a
certain
kind
such
service
however
ought
not
to
make
us
blindly
indulgent
hegel
philosophy
mingles
of
corruption
with
its
scanty
merits
and
must
now
that
it
has
become
make
ready
to
defend
itself
as
well
as
to
attack
others
it
is
with
no
hope
of
converting
independent
thinkers
but
rather
with
the
sole
aspiration
of
showing
some
chance
youthful
disciple
that
there
another
point
of
view
in
philosophy
that
i
fire
this
skirmisher
shot
which
may
i
hope
soon
be
followed
by
somebody
else
heavier
musketry
the
point
of
view
i
have
in
mind
will
become
clearer
if
i
begin
with
a
few
preparatory
remarks
on
the
motives
and
difficulties
of
philosophizing
in
general
to
show
that
the
real
is
identical
with
the
ideal
may
roughly
be
set
down
as
the
mainspring
of
philosophic
activity
the
atomic
and
mechanical
conception
of
the
world
is
as
ideal
from
the
point
of
view
of
some
of
our
faculties
as
the
teleological
one
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
others
in
the
realm
of
every
ideal
we
can
begin
anywhere
and
roam
over
the
field
each
term
passing
us
to
its
neighbor
each
member
calling
for
the
next
and
our
reason
rejoicing
in
its
glad
activity
where
the
parts
of
a
conception
seem
thus
to
belong
together
by
inward
kinship
where
the
whole
is
defined
in
a
way
congruous
with
our
powers
of
reaction
to
see
is
to
approve
and
to
understand
much
of
the
real
seems
at
the
first
blush
to
follow
a
different
law
the
parts
seem
as
hegel
has
said
to
be
shot
out
of
a
pistol
at
us
each
asserts
itself
as
a
simple
brute
fact
uncalled
for
by
the
rest
which
so
far
as
we
can
see
might
even
make
a
better
system
without
it
arbitrary
foreign
jolting
discontinuous
are
the
adjectives
by
which
we
are
tempted
to
describe
it
and
yet
from
out
the
bosom
of
it
a
partial
ideality
constantly
arises
which
keeps
alive
our
aspiration
that
the
whole
may
some
day
be
construed
in
ideal
form
not
only
do
the
materials
lend
themselves
under
certain
circumstances
to
aesthetic
manipulation
but
underlying
their
worst
disjointedness
are
three
great
continua
in
which
for
each
of
us
reason
ideal
is
actually
reached
i
mean
the
continua
of
memory
or
personal
consciousness
of
time
and
of
space
in
these
great
matrices
of
all
we
know
we
are
absolutely
at
home
the
things
we
meet
are
many
and
yet
are
one
each
is
itself
and
yet
all
belong
together
continuity
reigns
yet
individuality
is
not
lost
consider
for
example
space
it
is
a
unit
no
force
can
in
any
way
break
wound
or
tear
it
it
has
no
joints
between
which
you
can
pass
your
amputating
knife
for
it
penetrates
the
knife
and
is
not
split
try
to
make
a
hole
in
space
by
annihilating
an
inch
of
it
to
make
a
hole
you
must
drive
something
else
through
but
what
can
you
drive
through
space
except
what
is
itself
spatial
but
notwithstanding
it
is
this
very
paragon
of
unity
space
in
its
parts
contains
an
infinite
variety
and
the
unity
and
the
variety
do
not
contradict
each
other
for
they
obtain
in
different
respects
the
one
is
the
whole
the
many
are
the
parts
each
part
is
one
again
but
only
one
fraction
and
part
lies
beside
part
in
absolute
nextness
the
very
picture
of
peace
and
it
is
true
that
the
space
between
two
points
both
unites
and
divides
them
just
as
the
bar
of
a
both
unites
and
divides
the
two
balls
but
the
union
and
the
division
are
not
it
divides
them
by
keeping
them
out
of
the
space
between
it
unites
them
by
keeping
them
out
of
the
space
beyond
so
the
double
function
presents
no
inconsistency
in
space
could
only
ensue
if
one
part
tried
to
oust
another
from
its
position
but
the
notion
of
such
an
absurdity
vanishes
in
the
framing
and
can
not
stay
to
vex
the
mind
beyond
the
parts
we
see
or
think
at
any
given
time
extend
further
parts
but
the
beyond
is
homogeneous
with
what
is
embraced
and
follows
the
same
law
so
that
no
surprises
no
foreignness
can
ever
emerge
from
space
womb
thus
with
space
our
intelligence
is
absolutely
intimate
it
is
rationality
and
transparency
incarnate
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
ego
and
of
time
but
if
for
simplicity
sake
we
ignore
them
we
may
truly
say
that
when
we
desiderate
rational
knowledge
of
the
world
the
standard
set
by
our
knowledge
of
space
is
what
governs
our
desire
can
not
the
breaks
the
jolts
the
margin
of
foreignness
be
exorcised
from
other
things
and
leave
them
unitary
like
the
space
they
fill
could
this
be
done
the
philosophic
kingdom
of
heaven
would
be
at
hand
but
the
moment
we
turn
to
the
material
qualities
of
being
we
find
the
continuity
ruptured
on
every
side
a
fearful
jolting
begins
even
if
we
simplify
the
world
by
reducing
it
to
its
mechanical
bare
poles
atoms
and
their
motions
the
discontinuity
is
bad
enough
the
laws
of
clash
the
effects
of
distance
upon
attraction
and
repulsion
all
seem
arbitrary
collocations
of
data
the
atoms
themselves
are
so
many
independent
facts
the
existence
of
any
one
of
which
in
no
wise
seems
to
involve
the
existence
of
the
rest
we
have
not
banished
discontinuity
we
have
only
made
it
and
to
get
even
that
degree
of
rationality
into
the
universe
we
have
had
to
butcher
a
great
part
of
its
contents
the
secondary
qualities
we
stripped
off
from
the
reality
and
swept
into
the
labelled
illusion
still
are
facts
and
must
themselves
be
rationalized
in
some
way
but
when
we
deal
with
facts
believed
to
be
purely
subjective
we
are
farther
than
ever
from
the
goal
we
have
not
now
the
refuge
of
distinguishing
between
the
and
its
appearances
facts
of
thought
being
the
only
facts
differences
of
thought
become
the
only
differences
and
identities
of
thought
the
only
identities
there
are
two
thoughts
that
seem
different
are
different
to
all
eternity
we
can
no
longer
speak
of
heat
and
light
being
reconciled
in
any
like
for
motion
is
motion
and
light
is
light
and
heat
heat
forever
and
their
discontinuity
is
as
absolute
as
their
existence
together
with
the
other
attributes
and
things
we
conceive
they
make
up
plato
realm
of
immutable
ideas
neither
calls
for
the
other
hatches
it
out
is
its
creates
it
or
has
any
sort
of
inward
community
with
it
except
that
of
being
comparable
in
an
ego
and
found
more
or
less
differing
or
more
or
less
resembling
as
the
case
may
be
the
world
of
qualities
is
a
world
of
things
almost
wholly
discontinuous
each
only
says
i
am
that
i
am
and
each
says
it
on
its
own
account
and
with
absolute
monotony
the
continuities
of
which
they
in
plato
phrase
the
ego
space
and
time
are
for
most
of
them
the
only
grounds
of
union
they
possess
it
might
seem
as
if
in
the
mere
there
lay
a
contradiction
of
the
discontinuity
if
the
white
must
partake
of
space
the
heat
of
time
and
so
forth
do
not
whiteness
and
space
heat
and
time
mutually
call
for
or
help
to
create
each
other
yes
a
few
such
couplings
must
be
admitted
they
are
the
axioms
no
feeling
except
as
occupying
some
space
and
time
or
as
a
moment
in
some
ego
no
motion
but
of
something
moved
no
thought
but
of
an
object
no
time
without
a
previous
time
and
the
like
but
they
are
limited
in
number
and
they
obtain
only
between
excessively
broad
genera
of
concepts
and
leave
quite
undetermined
what
the
specifications
of
those
genera
shall
be
what
feeling
shall
fill
time
what
substance
execute
motion
what
qualities
combine
in
being
are
as
much
unanswered
questions
as
if
the
metaphysical
axioms
never
existed
at
all
the
existence
of
such
syntheses
as
they
are
does
then
but
slightly
mitigate
the
jolt
jolt
jolt
we
get
when
we
pass
over
the
facts
of
the
world
everywhere
indeterminate
variables
subject
only
to
these
few
vague
enveloping
laws
independent
in
all
such
seems
the
truth
in
yet
another
way
too
ideal
and
real
are
so
far
apart
that
their
conjunction
seems
quite
hopeless
to
eat
our
cake
and
have
it
to
lose
our
soul
and
save
it
to
enjoy
the
physical
privileges
of
selfishness
and
the
moral
luxury
of
altruism
at
the
same
time
would
be
the
ideal
but
the
real
offers
us
these
terms
in
the
shape
of
mutually
exclusive
alternatives
of
which
only
one
can
be
true
at
once
so
that
we
must
choose
and
in
choosing
murder
one
possibility
the
wrench
is
absolute
either
or
just
as
whenever
i
bet
a
hundred
dollars
on
an
event
there
comes
an
instant
when
i
am
a
hundred
dollars
richer
or
poorer
without
any
intermediate
degrees
passed
over
just
as
my
wavering
between
a
journey
to
portland
or
to
new
york
does
not
carry
me
from
cambridge
in
a
resultant
direction
in
which
both
motions
are
compounded
say
to
albany
but
at
a
given
moment
results
in
the
conjunction
of
reality
in
all
its
fulness
for
one
alternative
and
impossibility
in
all
its
fulness
for
the
other
so
the
bachelor
joys
are
utterly
lost
from
the
face
of
being
for
the
married
man
who
must
henceforward
find
his
account
in
something
that
is
not
them
but
is
good
enough
to
make
him
forget
them
so
the
careless
and
irresponsible
living
in
the
sunshine
the
after
supper
and
sleeping
upon
benches
in
the
afternoon
are
stars
that
have
set
upon
the
path
of
him
who
in
good
earnest
makes
himself
a
moralist
the
transitions
are
abrupt
absolute
truly
shot
out
of
a
pistol
for
while
many
possibilities
are
called
the
few
that
are
chosen
are
chosen
in
all
their
sudden
completeness
must
we
then
think
that
the
world
that
fills
space
and
time
can
yield
us
no
acquaintance
of
that
high
and
perfect
type
yielded
by
empty
space
and
time
themselves
is
what
unity
there
is
in
the
world
mainly
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
world
is
space
and
time
and
of
them
can
no
vision
of
it
forestall
the
facts
of
it
or
know
from
some
fractions
the
others
before
the
others
have
arrived
are
there
real
logically
indeterminate
possibilities
which
forbid
there
being
any
equivalent
for
the
happening
of
it
all
but
the
happening
itself
can
we
gain
no
anticipatory
assurance
that
what
is
to
come
will
have
no
strangeness
is
there
no
substitute
in
short
for
life
but
the
living
itself
in
all
its
weary
length
and
breadth
and
thickness
in
the
negative
reply
to
all
these
questions
a
modest
finds
no
difficulty
in
acquiescing
to
such
a
way
of
thinking
the
notion
of
has
a
deep
and
real
significance
whoso
partakes
of
a
thing
enjoys
his
share
and
comes
into
contact
with
the
thing
and
its
other
partakers
but
he
claims
no
more
his
share
in
no
wise
negates
the
thing
or
their
share
nor
does
it
preclude
his
possession
of
reserved
and
private
powers
with
which
they
have
nothing
to
do
and
which
are
not
all
absorbed
in
the
mere
function
of
sharing
why
may
not
the
world
be
a
sort
of
republican
banquet
of
this
sort
where
all
the
qualities
of
being
respect
one
another
personal
sacredness
yet
sit
at
the
common
table
of
space
and
time
to
me
this
view
seems
deeply
probable
things
cohere
but
the
act
of
cohesion
itself
implies
but
few
conditions
and
leaves
the
rest
of
their
qualifications
indeterminate
as
the
first
three
notes
of
a
tune
comport
many
endings
all
melodious
but
the
tune
is
not
named
till
a
particular
ending
has
actually
come
so
the
parts
actually
known
of
the
universe
may
comport
many
ideally
possible
complements
but
as
the
facts
are
not
the
complements
so
the
knowledge
of
the
one
is
not
the
knowledge
of
the
other
in
anything
but
the
few
necessary
elements
of
which
all
must
partake
in
order
to
be
together
at
all
why
if
one
act
of
knowledge
could
from
one
point
take
in
the
total
perspective
with
all
mere
possibilities
abolished
should
there
ever
have
been
anything
more
than
that
act
why
duplicate
it
by
the
tedious
unrolling
inch
by
inch
of
the
foredone
reality
no
answer
seems
possible
on
the
other
hand
if
we
stipulate
only
a
partial
community
of
partially
independent
powers
we
see
perfectly
why
no
one
part
controls
the
whole
view
but
each
detail
must
come
and
be
actually
given
before
in
any
special
sense
it
can
be
said
to
be
determined
at
all
this
is
the
moral
view
the
view
that
gives
to
other
powers
the
same
freedom
it
would
have
itself
not
the
ridiculous
to
do
right
which
in
my
mouth
can
only
mean
the
freedom
to
do
as
think
right
but
the
freedom
to
do
as
think
right
or
wrong
either
after
all
what
accounts
do
the
bounds
of
the
universe
owe
to
me
by
what
insatiate
conceit
and
lust
of
intellectual
despotism
do
i
arrogate
the
right
to
know
their
secrets
and
from
my
philosophic
throne
to
play
the
only
airs
they
shall
march
to
as
if
i
were
the
lord
anointed
is
not
my
knowing
them
at
all
a
gift
and
not
a
right
and
shall
it
be
given
before
they
are
given
gifts
something
to
be
thankful
for
it
is
a
gift
that
we
can
approach
things
at
all
and
by
means
of
the
time
and
space
of
which
our
minds
and
they
partake
alter
our
actions
so
as
to
meet
them
there
are
of
set
for
all
things
where
they
must
pause
or
rue
it
are
the
bounds
of
human
knowledge
set
for
it
not
by
it
now
to
a
mind
like
hegel
such
pusillanimous
twaddle
sounds
simply
loathsome
bounds
that
we
ca
overpass
data
facts
that
say
hands
off
till
we
are
given
possibilities
we
ca
control
a
banquet
of
which
we
merely
share
heavens
this
is
intolerable
such
a
world
is
no
world
for
a
philosopher
to
have
to
do
with
he
must
have
all
or
nothing
if
the
world
can
not
be
rational
in
my
sense
in
the
sense
of
unconditional
surrender
i
refuse
to
grant
that
it
is
rational
at
all
it
is
pure
incoherence
a
chaos
a
nulliverse
to
whose
haphazard
sway
i
will
not
truckle
but
no
this
is
not
the
world
the
world
is
philosophy
own
a
single
block
of
which
if
she
once
get
her
teeth
on
any
part
the
whole
shall
inevitably
become
her
prey
and
feed
her
theoretic
maw
naught
shall
be
but
the
necessities
she
creates
and
impossibilities
freedom
shall
mean
freedom
to
obey
her
will
ideal
and
actual
shall
be
one
she
and
i
as
her
champion
will
be
satisfied
on
no
lower
terms
the
insolence
of
sway
the
on
which
gods
take
vengeance
is
in
temporal
and
spiritual
matters
usually
admitted
to
be
a
vice
a
bonaparte
and
a
philip
ii
are
called
monsters
but
when
an
is
found
insatiate
enough
to
declare
that
all
existence
must
bend
the
knee
to
its
requirements
we
do
not
call
its
owner
a
monster
but
a
philosophic
prophet
may
not
this
be
all
wrong
is
there
any
one
of
our
functions
exempted
from
the
common
lot
of
liability
to
excess
and
where
everything
else
must
be
contented
with
its
part
in
the
universe
shall
the
theorizing
faculty
ride
over
the
whole
i
confess
i
can
see
no
reason
for
the
exception
he
who
claims
it
must
be
judged
by
the
consequences
of
his
acts
and
by
them
alone
let
hegel
then
confront
the
universe
with
his
claim
and
see
how
he
can
make
the
two
match
the
universe
absolutely
refuses
to
let
him
travel
without
jolt
time
space
and
his
ego
are
continuous
so
are
degrees
of
heat
shades
of
light
and
color
and
a
few
other
serial
things
so
too
do
potatoes
call
for
salt
and
cranberries
for
sugar
in
the
taste
of
one
who
knows
what
salt
and
sugar
are
but
on
the
whole
there
is
nought
to
soften
the
shock
of
surprise
to
his
intelligence
as
it
passes
from
one
quality
of
being
to
another
light
is
not
heat
heat
is
not
light
and
to
him
who
holds
the
one
the
other
is
not
given
till
it
give
itself
real
being
comes
moreover
and
goes
from
any
concept
at
its
own
sweet
will
with
no
permission
asked
of
the
conceiver
in
despair
must
hegel
lift
vain
hands
of
imprecation
and
since
he
will
take
nothing
but
the
whole
he
must
throw
away
even
the
part
he
might
retain
and
call
the
nature
of
things
an
muddle
and
incoherence
but
hark
what
wondrous
strain
is
this
that
steals
upon
his
ear
incoherence
itself
may
it
not
be
the
very
sort
of
coherence
i
require
muddle
is
it
anything
but
a
peculiar
sort
of
transparency
is
not
jolt
passage
is
friction
other
than
a
kind
of
lubrication
is
not
a
chasm
a
filling
a
queer
kind
of
filling
but
a
filling
still
why
seek
for
a
glue
to
hold
things
together
when
their
very
falling
apart
is
the
only
glue
you
need
let
all
that
negation
which
seemed
to
disintegrate
the
universe
be
the
mortar
that
combines
it
and
the
problem
stands
solved
the
paradoxical
character
of
the
notion
could
not
fail
to
please
a
mind
monstrous
even
in
its
native
germany
where
mental
excess
is
endemic
richard
for
a
moment
brought
to
bay
is
himself
again
he
vaults
into
the
saddle
and
from
that
time
his
career
is
that
of
a
philosophic
desperado
one
series
of
outrages
upon
the
chastity
of
thought
and
can
we
not
ourselves
sympathize
with
his
mood
in
some
degree
the
old
receipts
of
squeezing
the
thistle
and
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
have
many
applications
an
evil
frankly
accepted
loses
half
its
sting
and
all
its
terror
the
stoics
had
their
cheap
and
easy
way
of
dealing
with
evil
your
woes
goods
they
said
refuse
to
your
lost
blessings
by
that
name
and
you
are
happy
so
of
the
unintelligibilities
call
them
means
of
intelligibility
and
what
further
do
you
require
there
is
even
a
more
legitimate
excuse
than
that
in
the
exceedingness
of
the
facts
of
life
over
our
formulas
lies
a
standing
temptation
at
certain
times
to
give
up
trying
to
say
anything
adequate
about
them
and
to
take
refuge
in
wild
and
whirling
words
which
but
confess
our
impotence
before
their
ineffability
thus
baron
bunsen
writes
to
his
wife
nothing
is
near
but
the
far
nothing
true
but
the
highest
nothing
credible
but
the
inconceivable
nothing
so
real
as
the
impossible
nothing
clear
but
the
deepest
nothing
so
visible
as
the
invisible
and
no
life
is
there
but
through
death
of
these
ecstatic
moments
the
quia
is
the
classical
expression
hegel
originality
lies
in
his
making
their
mood
permanent
and
sacramental
and
authorized
to
supersede
all
others
not
as
a
mystical
bath
and
refuge
for
feeling
when
tired
reason
sickens
of
her
intellectual
responsibilities
thank
heaven
that
bath
is
always
ready
but
as
the
very
form
of
intellectual
responsibility
itself
and
now
after
this
long
introduction
let
me
trace
some
of
hegel
ways
of
applying
his
discovery
his
system
resembles
a
in
which
if
you
once
pass
the
door
you
may
be
lost
forever
safety
lies
in
not
entering
hegelians
have
anointed
so
to
speak
the
entrance
with
various
considerations
which
stated
in
an
abstract
form
are
so
plausible
as
to
slide
us
unresistingly
and
almost
unwittingly
through
the
fatal
arch
it
is
not
necessary
to
drink
the
ocean
to
know
that
it
is
salt
nor
need
a
critic
dissect
a
whole
system
after
proving
that
its
premises
are
rotten
i
shall
accordingly
confine
myself
to
a
few
of
the
points
that
captivate
beginners
most
and
assume
that
if
they
break
down
so
must
the
system
which
they
prop
first
of
all
hegel
has
to
do
utterly
away
with
the
sharing
and
partaking
business
he
so
much
loathes
he
will
not
call
contradiction
the
glue
in
one
place
and
identity
in
another
that
is
too
contradiction
must
be
a
glue
universal
and
must
derive
its
credit
from
being
shown
to
be
latently
involved
in
cases
that
we
hitherto
supposed
to
embody
pure
continuity
thus
the
relations
of
an
ego
with
its
objects
of
one
time
with
another
time
of
one
place
with
another
place
of
a
cause
with
its
effect
of
a
thing
with
its
properties
and
especially
of
parts
with
wholes
must
be
shown
to
involve
contradiction
contradiction
shown
to
lurk
in
the
very
heart
of
coherence
and
continuity
can
not
after
that
be
held
to
defeat
them
and
must
be
taken
as
the
universal
solvent
or
rather
there
is
no
longer
any
need
of
a
solvent
to
things
in
identity
was
the
dream
of
earlier
cruder
schools
hegel
will
show
that
their
very
difference
is
their
identity
and
that
in
the
act
of
detachment
the
detachment
is
undone
and
they
fall
into
each
other
arms
now
at
the
very
outset
it
seems
rather
odd
that
a
philosopher
who
pretends
that
the
world
is
absolutely
rational
or
in
other
words
that
it
can
be
completely
understood
should
fall
back
on
a
principle
the
identity
of
contradictories
which
utterly
defies
understanding
and
obliges
him
in
fact
to
use
the
word
whenever
it
occurs
in
his
pages
as
a
term
of
contempt
take
the
case
of
space
we
used
above
the
common
man
who
looks
at
space
believes
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
be
acquainted
with
beyond
what
he
sees
no
hidden
machinery
no
secrets
nothing
but
the
parts
as
they
lie
side
by
side
and
make
the
static
whole
his
intellect
is
satisfied
with
accepting
space
as
an
ultimate
genus
of
the
given
but
hegel
cries
to
him
dupe
dost
thou
not
see
it
to
be
one
nest
of
incompatibilities
do
not
the
unity
of
its
wholeness
and
the
diversity
of
its
parts
stand
in
patent
contradiction
does
it
not
both
unite
and
divide
things
and
but
for
this
strange
and
irreconcilable
activity
would
it
be
at
all
the
hidden
dynamism
of
is
what
incessantly
produces
the
static
appearance
by
which
your
sense
is
fooled
but
if
the
man
ask
how
do
all
this
and
how
its
dynamism
may
be
seen
to
work
hegel
can
only
reply
by
showing
him
the
space
itself
and
saying
lo
in
other
words
instead
of
the
principle
of
explanation
being
more
intelligible
than
the
thing
to
be
explained
it
is
absolutely
unintelligible
if
taken
by
itself
and
must
appeal
to
its
pretended
product
to
prove
its
existence
surely
such
a
system
of
explaining
per
of
making
the
borrow
credentials
from
the
and
of
creating
paradoxes
and
impossibilities
where
none
were
suspected
is
a
strange
candidate
for
the
honor
of
being
a
complete
rationalizer
of
the
world
the
principle
of
the
contradictoriness
of
identity
and
the
identity
of
contradictories
is
the
essence
of
the
hegelian
system
but
what
probably
washes
this
principle
down
most
with
beginners
is
the
combination
in
which
its
author
works
it
with
another
principle
which
is
by
no
means
characteristic
of
his
system
and
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
might
be
called
the
of
totality
this
principle
says
that
you
can
not
adequately
know
even
a
part
until
you
know
of
what
whole
it
forms
a
part
as
aristotle
writes
and
hegel
loves
to
quote
an
amputated
hand
is
not
even
a
hand
and
as
tennyson
says
little
flower
but
if
i
could
understand
what
you
are
root
and
all
and
all
in
all
i
should
know
what
god
and
man
is
obviously
until
we
have
taken
in
all
the
relations
immediate
or
remote
into
which
the
thing
actually
enters
or
potentially
may
enter
we
do
not
know
all
the
thing
and
obviously
for
such
an
exhaustive
acquaintance
with
the
thing
an
acquaintance
with
every
other
thing
actual
and
potential
near
and
remote
is
needed
so
that
it
is
quite
fair
to
say
that
omniscience
alone
can
completely
know
any
one
thing
as
it
stands
standing
in
a
world
of
relations
that
world
must
be
known
before
the
thing
is
fully
known
this
doctrine
is
of
course
an
integral
part
of
empiricism
an
integral
part
of
since
when
could
good
men
not
apprehend
the
passing
hour
in
the
light
of
life
larger
sweep
not
grow
dispassionate
the
more
they
stretched
their
view
did
the
of
sharing
so
little
legitimate
their
procedure
that
a
law
of
identity
of
contradictories
forsooth
must
be
trumped
up
to
give
it
scope
out
upon
the
idea
hume
account
of
causation
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
empiricism
may
use
the
principle
of
totality
we
call
something
a
cause
but
we
at
the
same
time
deny
its
effect
to
be
in
any
latent
way
contained
in
or
substantially
identical
with
it
we
thus
can
not
tell
what
its
causality
amounts
to
until
its
effect
has
actually
supervened
the
effect
then
or
something
beyond
the
thing
is
what
makes
the
thing
to
be
so
far
as
it
is
a
cause
humism
thus
says
that
its
causality
is
something
adventitious
and
not
necessarily
given
when
its
other
attributes
are
there
generalizing
this
empiricism
contends
that
we
must
everywhere
distinguish
between
the
intrinsic
being
of
a
thing
and
its
relations
and
among
these
between
those
that
are
essential
to
our
knowing
it
at
all
and
those
that
may
be
called
adventitious
the
thing
as
actually
present
in
a
given
world
is
there
with
its
relations
for
it
to
be
known
as
it
exists
they
must
be
known
too
and
it
and
they
form
a
single
fact
for
any
consciousness
large
enough
to
embrace
that
world
as
a
unity
but
what
constitutes
this
singleness
of
fact
this
unity
empiricism
says
nothing
but
the
matrix
in
which
the
several
items
of
the
world
find
themselves
embedded
time
namely
and
space
and
the
mind
of
the
knower
and
it
says
that
were
some
of
the
items
quite
different
from
what
they
are
and
others
the
same
still
for
aught
we
can
see
an
equally
unitary
world
might
be
provided
each
item
were
an
object
for
consciousness
and
occupied
a
determinate
point
in
space
and
time
all
the
adventitious
relations
would
in
such
a
world
be
changed
along
with
the
intrinsic
natures
and
places
of
the
beings
between
which
they
obtained
but
the
of
totality
in
knowledge
would
in
no
wise
be
affected
but
hegelism
dogmatically
denies
all
this
to
be
possible
in
the
first
place
it
says
there
are
no
intrinsic
natures
that
may
change
in
the
second
it
says
there
are
no
adventitious
relations
when
the
relations
of
what
we
call
a
thing
are
told
no
of
intrinsicality
no
is
left
the
relations
soak
up
all
there
is
of
the
thing
the
of
the
world
are
but
of
relation
with
other
of
relation
and
all
the
relations
are
necessary
the
unity
of
the
world
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
the
matrix
and
the
items
each
with
all
make
a
unity
simply
because
each
in
truth
is
all
the
rest
the
proof
lies
in
the
principle
of
totality
which
demands
that
if
any
one
part
be
posited
alone
all
the
others
shall
forthwith
from
it
and
infallibly
reproduce
the
whole
in
the
of
the
emanation
comes
in
as
i
said
that
partnership
of
the
principle
of
totality
with
that
of
the
identity
of
contradictories
which
so
recommends
the
latter
to
beginners
in
philosophy
to
posit
one
item
alone
is
to
deny
the
rest
to
deny
them
is
to
refer
to
them
to
refer
to
them
is
to
begin
at
least
to
bring
them
on
the
scene
and
to
begin
is
in
the
fulness
of
time
to
end
if
we
call
this
a
monism
hegel
is
quick
to
cry
not
so
to
say
simply
that
the
one
item
is
the
rest
of
the
universe
is
as
false
and
as
to
say
that
it
is
simply
itself
it
is
both
and
neither
and
the
only
condition
on
which
we
gain
the
right
to
affirm
that
it
is
is
that
we
fail
not
to
keep
affirming
all
the
while
that
it
is
not
as
well
thus
the
truth
refuses
to
be
expressed
in
any
single
act
of
judgment
or
sentence
the
world
appears
as
a
monism
a
pluralism
just
as
it
appeared
in
our
own
introductory
exposition
but
the
trouble
that
keeps
us
and
hegel
from
ever
joining
hands
over
this
apparent
formula
of
brotherhood
is
that
we
distinguish
or
try
to
distinguish
the
respects
in
which
the
world
is
one
from
those
in
which
it
is
many
while
all
such
stable
distinctions
are
what
he
most
abominates
the
reader
may
decide
which
procedure
helps
his
reason
most
for
my
own
part
the
formula
of
empiricist
pluralism
that
the
world
can
not
be
set
down
in
any
single
proposition
grows
less
instead
of
more
intelligible
when
i
add
and
yet
the
different
propositions
that
express
it
are
one
the
unity
of
the
propositions
is
that
of
the
mind
that
harbors
them
any
one
who
insists
that
their
diversity
is
in
any
way
itself
their
unity
can
only
do
so
because
he
loves
obscurity
and
mystification
for
their
own
pure
sakes
where
you
meet
with
a
contradiction
among
realities
herbart
used
to
say
it
shows
you
have
failed
to
make
a
real
distinction
sovereign
method
of
going
to
work
and
saving
all
possible
contradictions
lies
in
pertinaciously
refusing
to
distinguish
he
takes
what
is
true
of
a
term
treats
it
as
true
of
the
same
term
and
then
of
course
applies
it
to
the
term
a
good
example
of
this
is
found
in
the
first
triad
this
triad
shows
that
the
mutability
of
the
real
world
is
due
to
the
fact
that
being
constantly
negates
itself
that
whatever
by
the
same
act
and
gets
undone
and
swept
away
and
that
thus
the
irremediable
torrent
of
life
about
which
so
much
rhetoric
has
been
written
has
its
roots
in
an
ineluctable
necessity
which
lies
revealed
to
our
logical
reason
this
notion
of
a
being
which
forever
stumbles
over
its
own
feet
and
has
to
change
in
order
to
exist
at
all
is
a
very
picturesque
symbol
of
the
reality
and
is
probably
one
of
the
points
that
make
young
readers
feel
as
if
a
deep
core
of
truth
lay
in
the
system
but
how
is
the
reasoning
done
pure
being
is
assumed
without
determinations
being
in
this
respect
it
agrees
with
nothing
therefore
it
is
nothing
wherever
we
find
it
it
is
nothing
crowned
with
complete
determinations
then
or
it
is
nothing
still
and
sich
it
is
as
if
we
said
man
without
his
clothes
may
be
named
naked
therefore
man
is
the
naked
and
finally
man
with
his
hat
shoes
and
overcoat
on
is
the
naked
still
of
course
we
may
in
this
instance
or
any
other
repeat
that
the
conclusion
is
strictly
true
however
comical
it
seems
man
within
the
clothes
is
naked
just
as
he
is
without
them
man
would
never
have
invented
the
clothes
had
he
not
been
naked
the
fact
of
his
being
clad
at
all
does
prove
his
essential
nudity
and
so
in
general
the
form
of
any
judgment
being
the
addition
of
a
predicate
to
a
subject
shows
that
the
subject
has
been
conceived
without
the
predicate
and
thus
by
a
strained
metaphor
may
be
called
the
predicate
negation
well
and
good
let
the
expression
pass
but
we
must
notice
this
the
judgment
has
now
created
a
new
subject
the
and
all
propositions
regarding
this
must
be
judged
on
their
own
merits
for
those
true
of
the
old
subject
naked
are
no
longer
true
of
this
one
for
instance
we
can
not
say
because
the
naked
pure
and
simple
must
not
enter
the
or
is
in
danger
of
taking
cold
that
the
naked
with
his
clothes
on
will
also
take
cold
or
must
stay
in
his
bedroom
hold
to
it
eternally
that
the
clad
man
still
naked
if
it
amuse
you
is
designated
in
the
bond
but
the
contradiction
is
a
sterile
boon
like
shylock
pound
of
flesh
it
leads
to
no
consequences
it
does
not
entitle
you
to
one
drop
of
his
christian
blood
either
in
the
way
of
catarrh
social
exclusion
or
what
further
results
pure
nakedness
may
involve
in
a
version
of
the
first
step
given
by
our
foremost
american
hegelian
we
find
this
playing
with
the
necessary
form
of
judgment
pure
being
he
says
has
no
determinations
but
the
having
none
is
itself
a
determination
wherefore
pure
being
contradicts
its
own
self
and
so
on
why
not
take
heed
to
the
of
what
is
said
when
we
make
the
predication
concerning
pure
being
our
meaning
is
merely
the
denial
of
all
other
determinations
than
the
particular
one
we
make
the
showman
who
advertised
his
elephant
as
than
any
elephant
in
the
world
except
himself
must
have
been
in
an
hegelian
country
where
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
were
less
explicit
the
audience
would
dialectically
proceed
to
say
this
elephant
larger
than
any
in
the
world
involves
a
contradiction
for
he
himself
is
in
the
world
and
so
stands
endowed
with
the
virtue
of
being
both
larger
and
smaller
than
himself
a
perfect
hegelian
elephant
whose
immanent
can
only
be
removed
in
a
higher
synthesis
show
us
the
higher
synthesis
we
do
care
to
see
such
a
mere
abstract
creature
as
your
elephant
it
may
be
and
it
was
indeed
suggested
in
antiquity
that
all
things
are
of
their
own
size
by
being
both
larger
and
smaller
than
themselves
but
in
the
case
of
this
elephant
the
scrupulous
showman
nipped
such
philosophizing
and
all
its
inconvenient
consequences
in
the
bud
by
explicitly
intimating
that
larger
than
any
elephant
was
all
he
meant
hegel
quibble
with
this
word
exemplifies
the
same
fallacy
all
as
such
are
according
to
him
identical
that
is
which
can
only
be
predicated
of
a
given
thing
as
other
than
etc
is
predicated
and
made
to
identify
the
in
question
with
which
is
other
only
namely
other
than
another
maxim
that
hegelism
is
never
tired
of
repeating
is
that
to
know
a
limit
is
already
to
be
beyond
it
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
the
inmate
of
the
penitentiary
shows
by
his
grumbling
that
he
is
still
in
the
stage
of
abstraction
and
of
separative
thought
the
more
keenly
he
thinks
of
the
fun
he
might
be
having
outside
the
more
deeply
he
ought
to
feel
that
the
walls
identify
him
with
it
they
set
him
beyond
them
in
imagination
in
longing
in
despair
they
take
him
there
and
in
every
way
in
flesh
in
power
in
deed
foolish
convict
to
ignore
his
blessings
another
mode
of
stating
his
principle
is
this
to
know
the
finite
as
such
is
also
to
know
the
infinite
expressed
in
this
abstract
shape
the
formula
is
as
insignificant
as
it
is
unobjectionable
we
can
cap
every
word
with
a
negative
particle
and
the
word
immediately
suggests
the
word
and
we
know
the
two
words
together
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
thing
to
take
the
knowledge
of
a
concrete
case
of
ending
and
to
say
that
it
virtually
makes
us
acquainted
with
other
concrete
facts
for
in
the
first
place
the
end
may
be
an
absolute
one
the
of
the
universe
for
instance
is
according
to
all
appearances
in
finite
amount
and
if
we
knew
that
we
had
counted
the
last
bit
of
it
infinite
knowledge
in
that
respect
so
far
from
being
given
would
be
impossible
with
regard
to
it
is
true
that
in
drawing
a
bound
we
are
aware
of
more
but
to
treat
this
little
fringe
as
the
equal
of
infinite
space
is
ridiculous
it
resembles
infinite
space
or
in
but
one
respect
its
spatial
quality
we
believe
it
homogeneous
with
whatever
spaces
may
remain
but
it
would
be
fatuous
to
say
because
one
dollar
in
my
pocket
is
homogeneous
with
all
the
dollars
in
the
country
that
to
have
it
is
to
have
them
the
further
points
of
space
are
as
numerically
distinct
from
the
fringe
as
the
dollars
from
the
dollar
and
not
until
we
have
actually
intuited
them
can
we
be
said
to
them
the
hegelian
reply
is
that
the
of
space
constitutes
its
only
and
that
there
is
nothing
true
good
or
beautiful
to
be
known
in
the
spaces
beyond
which
is
not
already
known
in
the
fringe
this
introduction
of
a
eulogistic
term
into
a
mathematical
question
is
original
the
and
the
infinite
are
about
as
appropriate
distinctions
in
a
discussion
of
cognition
as
the
good
and
the
naughty
rain
would
be
in
a
treatise
on
meteorology
but
when
we
grant
that
all
the
worth
of
the
knowledge
of
distant
spaces
is
due
to
the
knowledge
of
what
they
may
carry
in
them
it
then
appears
more
than
ever
absurd
to
say
that
the
knowledge
of
the
fringe
is
an
equivalent
for
the
infinitude
of
the
distant
knowledge
the
distant
spaces
even
are
not
yet
yielded
to
our
thinking
and
if
they
were
yielded
would
not
be
yielded
or
in
respect
to
their
material
filling
out
shylock
bond
was
an
omnipotent
instrument
compared
with
this
knowledge
of
the
finite
which
remains
the
ignorance
it
always
was
till
the
infinite
by
its
own
act
has
piece
by
piece
placed
itself
in
our
hands
here
hegelism
cries
out
by
the
identity
of
the
knowledges
of
infinite
and
finite
i
never
meant
that
one
could
be
a
for
the
other
nor
does
true
philosophy
ever
mean
by
identity
capacity
for
substitution
this
sounds
suspiciously
like
the
good
and
the
naughty
infinite
or
rather
like
the
mysteries
of
the
trinity
and
the
eucharist
to
the
unsentimental
mind
there
are
but
two
sorts
of
identity
total
identity
and
partial
identity
where
the
identity
is
total
the
things
can
be
substituted
wholly
for
one
another
where
substitution
is
impossible
it
must
be
that
the
identity
is
incomplete
it
is
the
duty
of
the
student
then
to
ascertain
the
exact
which
it
obtains
as
we
have
tried
to
do
above
even
the
catholic
will
tell
you
that
when
he
believes
in
the
identity
of
the
wafer
with
christ
body
he
does
not
mean
in
all
respects
so
that
he
might
use
it
to
exhibit
muscular
fibre
or
a
cook
make
it
smell
like
baked
meat
in
the
oven
he
means
that
in
the
one
sole
respect
of
nourishing
his
being
in
a
certain
way
it
is
identical
with
and
can
be
substituted
for
the
very
body
of
his
redeemer
knowledge
of
opposites
is
one
is
one
of
the
hegelian
first
principles
of
which
the
preceding
are
perhaps
only
derivatives
here
again
hegelism
takes
and
substituting
it
for
knowledge
in
a
particular
respect
avails
itself
of
the
confusion
to
cover
other
respects
never
originally
implied
when
the
knowledge
of
a
thing
is
given
us
we
no
doubt
think
that
the
thing
may
or
must
have
an
opposite
this
postulate
of
something
opposite
we
may
call
a
of
the
opposite
if
we
like
but
it
is
a
knowledge
of
it
in
only
that
one
single
respect
that
it
is
something
opposite
no
number
of
opposites
to
a
quality
we
have
never
directly
experienced
could
ever
lead
us
positively
to
infer
what
that
quality
is
there
is
a
jolt
between
the
negation
of
them
and
the
actual
positing
of
it
in
its
proper
shape
that
twenty
logics
of
hegel
harnessed
abreast
can
not
drive
us
smoothly
over
the
use
of
the
maxim
determination
is
negation
is
the
fattest
and
most
application
of
the
method
of
refusing
to
distinguish
taken
in
its
vague
confusion
it
probably
does
more
than
anything
else
to
produce
the
sort
of
flicker
and
dazzle
which
are
the
first
mental
conditions
for
the
reception
of
hegel
system
the
word
taken
is
treated
as
if
it
covered
an
indefinite
number
of
culminating
in
the
very
peculiar
one
of
whence
finally
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
assertions
are
universally
as
this
is
an
important
matter
it
seems
worth
while
to
treat
it
a
little
minutely
when
i
measure
out
a
pint
say
of
milk
and
so
determine
it
what
do
i
do
i
virtually
make
two
assertions
regarding
it
it
is
this
pint
it
is
not
those
other
gallons
one
of
these
is
an
affirmation
the
other
a
negation
both
have
a
common
subject
but
the
predicates
being
mutually
exclusive
the
two
assertions
lie
beside
each
other
in
endless
peace
i
may
with
propriety
be
said
to
make
assertions
more
remote
still
assertions
of
which
those
other
gallons
are
the
subject
as
it
is
not
they
so
are
they
not
the
pint
which
it
is
the
determination
this
is
the
pint
carries
with
it
the
negation
those
are
not
the
pints
here
we
have
the
same
predicate
but
the
subjects
are
exclusive
of
each
other
so
there
is
again
endless
peace
in
both
couples
of
propositions
negation
and
affirmation
are
this
is
this
is
this
kind
of
negation
involved
in
determination
can
not
possibly
be
what
hegel
wants
for
his
purposes
the
table
is
not
the
chair
the
fireplace
is
not
the
cupboard
these
are
literal
expressions
of
the
law
of
identity
and
contradiction
those
principles
of
the
abstracting
and
separating
understanding
for
which
hegel
has
so
sovereign
a
contempt
and
which
his
logic
is
meant
to
supersede
and
accordingly
hegelians
pursue
the
subject
further
saying
there
is
in
every
determination
an
element
of
real
conflict
do
you
not
in
determining
the
milk
to
be
this
pint
exclude
it
forever
from
the
chance
of
being
those
gallons
frustrate
it
from
expansion
and
so
do
you
not
equally
exclude
them
from
the
being
which
it
now
maintains
as
its
own
assuredly
if
you
had
been
hearing
of
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
had
gone
there
with
unlimited
expectations
of
the
rivers
the
milk
would
fill
and
if
you
found
there
was
but
this
single
pint
in
the
whole
country
the
determination
of
the
pint
would
exclude
another
determination
which
your
mind
had
previously
made
of
the
milk
there
would
be
a
real
conflict
resulting
in
the
victory
of
one
side
the
rivers
would
be
negated
by
the
single
pint
being
affirmed
and
as
rivers
and
pint
are
affirmed
of
the
same
milk
first
as
supposed
and
then
as
found
the
contradiction
would
be
complete
but
it
is
a
contradiction
that
can
never
by
any
chance
occur
in
real
nature
or
being
it
can
only
occur
between
a
false
representation
of
a
being
and
the
true
idea
of
the
being
when
actually
cognized
the
first
got
into
a
place
where
it
had
no
rights
and
had
to
be
ousted
but
in
things
do
not
get
into
one
another
logical
places
the
gallons
first
spoken
of
never
say
we
are
the
pint
the
pint
never
says
i
am
the
gallons
it
never
tries
to
expand
and
so
there
is
no
chance
for
anything
to
exclude
or
negate
it
it
thus
remains
affirmed
absolutely
can
it
be
believed
in
the
teeth
of
these
elementary
truths
that
the
principle
is
held
throughout
hegel
to
imply
an
active
contradiction
conflict
and
exclusion
do
the
jingling
outside
negate
me
writing
in
this
room
do
i
reader
negate
you
of
course
if
i
say
reader
we
are
two
and
therefore
i
am
two
i
negate
you
for
i
am
actually
thrusting
a
part
into
the
seat
of
the
whole
the
orthodox
logic
expresses
the
fallacy
by
saying
the
we
is
taken
by
me
distributively
instead
of
collectively
but
as
long
as
i
do
not
make
this
blunder
and
am
content
with
my
part
we
all
are
safe
in
parts
remain
parts
can
you
imagine
one
position
in
space
trying
to
get
into
the
place
of
another
position
and
having
to
be
by
that
other
can
you
imagine
your
thought
of
an
object
trying
to
dispossess
the
real
object
from
its
being
and
so
being
negated
by
it
the
great
the
sacred
law
of
partaking
the
noiseless
step
of
continuity
seems
something
that
hegel
can
not
possibly
understand
all
or
nothing
is
his
one
idea
for
him
each
point
of
space
of
time
each
feeling
in
the
ego
each
quality
of
being
is
clamoring
i
am
the
all
there
is
nought
else
but
me
this
clamor
is
its
essence
which
has
to
be
negated
in
another
act
which
gives
it
its
true
determination
what
there
is
of
affirmative
in
this
determination
is
thus
the
mere
residuum
left
from
the
negation
by
others
of
the
negation
it
originally
applied
to
them
but
why
talk
of
residuum
the
kilkenny
cats
of
fable
could
leave
a
residuum
in
the
shape
of
their
undevoured
tails
but
the
kilkenny
cats
of
existence
as
it
appears
in
the
pages
of
hegel
are
and
leave
no
residuum
such
is
the
unexampled
fury
of
their
onslaught
that
they
get
clean
out
of
themselves
and
into
each
other
nay
more
pass
right
through
each
other
and
then
return
into
themselves
ready
for
another
round
as
insatiate
but
as
inconclusive
as
the
one
that
went
before
if
i
characterized
hegel
own
mood
as
the
insolence
of
excess
what
shall
i
say
of
the
mood
he
ascribes
to
being
man
makes
the
gods
in
his
image
and
hegel
in
daring
to
insult
the
spotless
of
space
and
time
the
in
branding
as
strife
that
law
of
sharing
under
whose
sacred
keeping
like
a
strain
of
music
like
an
odor
of
incense
as
emerson
says
the
dance
of
the
atoms
goes
forward
still
seems
to
me
but
to
manifest
his
own
deformity
this
leads
me
to
animadvert
on
an
erroneous
inference
which
hegelian
idealism
makes
from
the
form
of
the
negative
judgment
every
negation
it
says
must
be
an
intellectual
act
even
the
most
realism
will
hardly
pretend
that
the
as
such
exists
after
the
same
fashion
as
the
table
does
but
table
and
since
they
are
given
to
our
thought
together
must
be
consubstantial
try
to
make
the
position
or
affirmation
of
the
table
as
simple
as
you
can
it
is
also
the
negation
of
the
and
thus
positive
being
itself
seems
after
all
but
a
function
of
intelligence
like
negation
idealism
is
proved
realism
is
unthinkable
now
i
have
not
myself
the
least
objection
to
idealism
an
hypothesis
which
voluminous
considerations
make
plausible
and
whose
difficulties
may
be
cleared
away
any
day
by
new
discriminations
or
discoveries
but
i
object
to
proving
by
these
patent
methods
that
which
can
only
be
the
fruit
of
a
wide
and
patient
induction
for
the
truth
is
that
our
affirmations
and
negations
do
not
stand
on
the
same
footing
at
all
and
are
anything
but
consubstantial
an
affirmation
says
something
about
an
objective
existence
a
negation
says
something
an
namely
that
it
is
false
there
are
no
negative
predicates
or
falsities
in
nature
being
makes
no
false
hypotheses
that
have
to
be
contradicted
the
only
denials
she
can
be
in
any
way
construed
to
perform
are
denials
of
our
errors
this
shows
plainly
enough
that
denial
must
be
of
something
mental
since
the
thing
denied
is
always
a
fiction
the
table
is
not
the
chair
supposes
the
speaker
to
have
been
playing
with
the
false
notion
that
it
may
have
been
the
chair
but
affirmation
may
perfectly
well
be
of
something
having
no
such
necessary
and
constitutive
relation
to
thought
whether
it
really
is
of
such
a
thing
is
for
harder
considerations
to
decide
if
idealism
be
true
the
great
question
that
presents
itself
is
whether
its
truth
involve
the
necessity
of
an
infinite
unitary
and
omniscient
consciousness
or
whether
a
republic
of
consciousnesses
will
do
consciousnesses
united
by
a
certain
common
fund
of
representations
but
each
possessing
a
private
store
which
the
others
do
not
share
either
hypothesis
is
to
me
conceivable
but
whether
the
egos
be
one
or
many
the
of
representations
to
one
another
within
them
is
the
principle
of
unification
of
the
universe
to
be
thus
consciously
next
to
some
other
representation
is
the
condition
to
which
each
representation
must
submit
under
penalty
of
being
excluded
from
this
universe
and
like
lord
dundreary
bird
all
alone
and
forming
a
separate
universe
by
itself
but
this
is
only
a
condition
of
which
the
representations
it
leaves
all
their
other
determinations
undecided
to
say
because
representation
can
not
be
in
the
same
universe
with
without
being
that
therefore
possesses
involves
or
necessitates
hide
and
hair
flesh
and
fell
all
appurtenances
and
belongings
is
only
the
silly
hegelian
insatiateness
once
more
hegel
own
logic
with
all
the
senseless
of
its
triads
utterly
fails
to
prove
his
position
the
only
evident
compulsion
which
representations
exert
upon
one
another
is
compulsion
to
submit
to
the
conditions
of
entrance
into
the
same
universe
with
them
the
conditions
of
continuity
of
selfhood
space
and
time
under
penalty
of
being
excluded
but
what
this
universe
shall
be
is
a
matter
of
fact
which
we
can
not
decide
till
we
know
what
representations
submitted
to
these
its
sole
conditions
the
conditions
themselves
impose
no
further
requirements
in
short
the
notion
that
real
contingency
and
ambiguity
may
be
features
of
the
real
world
is
a
perfectly
unimpeachable
hypothesis
only
in
such
a
world
can
moral
judgments
have
a
claim
to
be
for
the
bad
is
that
which
takes
the
place
of
something
else
which
possibly
might
have
been
where
it
now
is
and
the
better
is
that
which
absolutely
might
be
where
it
absolutely
is
not
in
the
universe
of
hegel
the
absolute
block
whose
parts
have
no
loose
play
the
pure
plethora
of
necessary
being
with
the
oxygen
of
possibility
all
suffocated
out
of
its
lungs
there
can
be
neither
good
nor
bad
but
one
dead
level
of
mere
fate
but
i
have
tired
the
reader
out
the
worst
of
criticising
hegel
is
that
the
very
arguments
we
use
against
him
give
forth
strange
and
hollow
sounds
that
make
them
seem
almost
as
fantastic
as
the
errors
to
which
they
are
addressed
the
sense
of
a
universal
mirage
of
a
ghostly
unreality
steals
over
us
which
is
the
very
moonlit
atmosphere
of
hegelism
itself
what
wonder
then
if
instead
of
converting
our
words
do
but
rejoice
and
delight
those
already
baptized
in
the
faith
of
confusion
to
their
charmed
senses
we
all
seem
children
of
hegel
together
only
some
of
us
have
not
the
wit
to
know
our
own
father
just
as
romanists
are
sure
to
inform
us
that
our
reasons
against
papal
christianity
unconsciously
breathe
the
purest
spirit
of
catholicism
so
hegelism
benignantly
smiles
at
our
exertions
and
murmurs
if
the
red
slayer
think
he
slays
when
me
they
fly
i
am
the
wings
etc
to
forefend
this
unwelcome
adoption
let
me
recapitulate
in
a
few
propositions
the
reasons
why
i
am
not
an
hegelian
we
can
not
eat
our
cake
and
have
it
that
is
the
only
real
contradiction
there
can
be
between
thoughts
is
where
one
is
true
the
other
false
when
this
happens
one
must
go
forever
nor
is
there
any
synthesis
in
which
both
can
wholly
revive
a
chasm
is
not
a
bridge
in
any
utilizable
sense
that
is
no
mere
negation
can
be
the
instrument
of
a
positive
advance
in
thought
the
continua
time
space
and
the
ego
are
bridges
because
they
are
without
chasm
but
they
bridge
over
the
chasms
between
represented
qualities
only
partially
this
partial
bridging
however
makes
the
qualities
share
in
a
common
world
the
other
characteristics
of
the
qualities
are
separate
facts
but
the
same
quality
appears
in
many
times
and
spaces
generic
sameness
of
the
quality
wherever
found
becomes
thus
a
further
means
by
which
the
jolts
are
reduced
what
between
different
qualities
jolts
remain
each
as
far
as
the
other
is
concerned
is
an
absolutely
separate
and
contingent
being
the
moral
judgment
may
lead
us
to
postulate
as
irreducible
the
contingencies
of
the
world
elements
mutually
contingent
are
not
in
conflict
so
long
as
they
partake
of
the
continua
of
time
space
partaking
being
the
exact
opposite
of
strife
they
conflict
only
when
as
mutually
exclusive
possibilities
they
strive
to
possess
themselves
of
the
same
parts
of
time
space
and
ego
that
there
are
such
real
conflicts
irreducible
to
any
intelligence
and
giving
rise
to
an
excess
of
possibility
over
actuality
is
an
hypothesis
but
a
credible
one
no
philosophy
should
pretend
to
be
anything
more
since
the
preceding
article
was
written
some
observations
on
the
effects
of
which
i
was
prompted
to
make
by
reading
the
pamphlet
called
the
anaesthetic
revelation
and
the
gist
of
philosophy
by
benjamin
paul
blood
amsterdam
have
made
me
understand
better
than
ever
before
both
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
hegel
philosophy
i
strongly
urge
others
to
repeat
the
experiment
which
with
pure
gas
is
short
and
harmless
enough
the
effects
will
of
course
vary
with
the
individual
just
as
they
vary
in
the
same
individual
from
time
to
time
but
it
is
probable
that
in
the
former
case
as
in
the
latter
a
generic
resemblance
will
obtain
with
me
as
with
every
other
person
of
whom
i
have
heard
the
keynote
of
the
experience
is
the
tremendously
exciting
sense
of
an
intense
metaphysical
illumination
truth
lies
open
to
the
view
in
depth
beneath
depth
of
almost
blinding
evidence
the
mind
sees
all
the
logical
relations
of
being
with
an
apparent
subtlety
and
instantaneity
to
which
its
normal
consciousness
offers
no
parallel
only
as
sobriety
returns
the
feeling
of
insight
fades
and
one
is
left
staring
vacantly
at
a
few
disjointed
words
and
phrases
as
one
stares
at
a
from
which
the
sunset
glow
has
just
fled
or
at
the
black
cinder
left
by
an
extinguished
brand
the
immense
emotional
sense
of
which
characterizes
the
stage
of
alcoholic
drunkenness
a
stage
which
seems
silly
to
but
the
subjective
rapture
of
which
probably
constitutes
a
chief
part
of
the
temptation
to
the
vice
is
well
known
the
centre
and
periphery
of
things
seem
to
come
together
the
ego
and
its
objects
the
and
the
are
one
now
this
only
a
thousandfold
enhanced
was
the
effect
upon
me
of
the
gas
and
its
first
result
was
to
make
peal
through
me
with
unutterable
power
the
conviction
that
hegelism
was
true
after
all
and
that
the
deepest
convictions
of
my
intellect
hitherto
were
wrong
whatever
idea
or
representation
occurred
to
the
mind
was
seized
by
the
same
logical
forceps
and
served
to
illustrate
the
same
truth
and
that
truth
was
that
every
opposition
among
whatsoever
things
vanishes
in
a
higher
unity
in
which
it
is
based
that
all
contradictions
are
but
differences
that
all
differences
are
of
degree
that
all
degrees
are
of
a
common
kind
that
unbroken
continuity
is
of
the
essence
of
being
and
that
we
are
literally
in
the
midst
of
to
perceive
the
existence
of
which
is
the
utmost
we
can
attain
without
the
as
a
basis
how
could
strife
occur
strife
presupposes
something
to
be
striven
about
and
in
this
common
topic
the
same
for
both
parties
the
differences
merge
from
the
hardest
contradiction
to
the
tenderest
diversity
of
verbiage
differences
evaporate
and
agree
at
least
in
being
assertions
a
denial
of
a
statement
is
but
another
mode
of
stating
the
same
contradiction
can
only
occur
of
the
same
thing
all
opinions
are
thus
synonyms
are
synonymous
are
the
same
but
the
same
phrase
by
difference
of
emphasis
is
two
and
here
again
difference
and
merge
in
one
it
is
impossible
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
torrential
character
of
the
identification
of
opposites
as
it
streams
through
the
mind
in
this
experience
i
have
sheet
after
sheet
of
phrases
dictated
or
written
during
the
intoxication
which
to
the
sober
reader
seem
meaningless
drivel
but
which
at
the
moment
of
transcribing
were
fused
in
the
fire
of
infinite
rationality
god
and
devil
good
and
evil
life
and
death
i
and
thou
sober
and

swallowing

fate

great
and
small

and
intent
joke
and
earnest
tragic
and
comic
and
fifty
other
contrasts
figure
in
these
pages
in
the
same
monotonous
way
the
mind
saw
how
each
term
to
its
contrast
through
a
moment
of
transition
which
effected
and
which
perennial
and
eternal
was
the
of
life
the
thought
of
mutual
implication
of
the
parts
in
the
bare
form
of
a
judgment
of
opposition
as
but
more
than
if
produced
a
perfect
delirium
of
theoretic
rapture
and
at
last
when
definite
ideas
to
work
on
came
slowly
the
mind
went
through
the
mere
of
recognizing
sameness
in
identity
by
contrasting
the
same
word
with
itself
differently
emphasized
or
shorn
of
its
initial
letter
let
me
transcribe
a
few
sentences
what
mistake
but
a
kind
of
take
what
nausea
but
a
kind
of
sober
drunk
astonishment
everything
can
become
the
subject
of
criticism
how
criticise
without
something
criticise
agreement
disagreement
emotion
motion
die
away
from
die
away
without
the
reconciliation
of
opposites
sober
drunk
all
the
same
good
and
evil
reconciled
in
a
laugh
it
escapes
it
escapes
but
what
escapes
what
escapes
emphasis
emphasis
there
must
be
some
emphasis
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
phasis
no
verbiage
can
give
it
because
the
verbiage
is
coherent
same
and
it
fades
and
it
infinite
and
it
infinite
if
it
was
why
should
you
hold
on
to
it

you
see
the

do
you
see

the
most
coherent
and
articulate
sentence
which
came
was
this
there
are
no
differences
but
differences
of
degree
between
different
degrees
of
difference
and
no
difference
this
phrase
has
the
true
hegelian
ring
being
in
fact
a
regular
als
sich
auf
sich
selbst
beziehende
and
true
hegelians
will
be
able
to
read
between
the
lines
and
feel
at
any
rate
what
ecstasies
of
cognitive
emotion
might
have
bathed
these
tattered
fragments
of
thought
when
they
were
alive
but
for
the
assurance
of
a
certain
amount
of
respect
from
them
i
should
hardly
have
ventured
to
print
what
must
be
such
caviare
to
the
general
but
now
comes
the
reverse
of
the
medal
what
is
the
principle
of
unity
in
all
this
monotonous
rain
of
instances
although
i
did
not
see
it
at
first
i
soon
found
that
it
was
in
each
case
nothing
but
the
abstract
of
which
the
conflicting
terms
were
opposite
species
in
other
words
although
the
flood
of
ontologic
was
hegelian
through
and
through
the
for
it
was
nothing
but
the
principle
that
things
are
the
same
only
so
far
and
no
farther
than
they
the
same
or
partake
of
a
common
nature
the
principle
that
hegel
most
tramples
under
foot
at
the
same
time
the
rapture
of
beholding
a
process
that
was
infinite
changed
as
the
nature
of
the
infinitude
was
realized
by
the
mind
into
the
sense
of
a
dreadful
and
ineluctable
fate
with
whose
magnitude
every
finite
effort
is
incommensurable
and
in
the
light
of
which
whatever
happens
is
indifferent
this
instantaneous
revulsion
of
mood
from
rapture
to
horror
is
perhaps
the
strongest
emotion
i
have
ever
experienced
i
got
it
repeatedly
when
the
inhalation
was
continued
long
enough
to
produce
incipient
nausea
and
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
the
normal
and
inevitable
outcome
of
the
intoxication
if
sufficiently
prolonged
a
pessimistic
fatalism
depth
within
depth
of
impotence
and
indifference
reason
and
silliness
united
not
in
a
higher
synthesis
but
in
the
fact
that
whichever
you
choose
it
is
all
one
this
is
the
upshot
of
a
revelation
that
began
so
rosy
bright
even
when
the
process
stops
short
of
this
ultimatum
the
reader
will
have
noticed
from
the
phrases
quoted
how
often
it
ends
by
losing
the
clue
something
and
the
feeling
of
insight
is
changed
into
an
intense
one
of
bewilderment
puzzle
confusion
astonishment
i
know
no
more
singular
sensation
than
this
intense
bewilderment
with
nothing
particular
left
to
be
bewildered
at
save
the
bewilderment
itself
it
seems
indeed
causa
or
become
its
own
object
my
conclusion
is
that
the
togetherness
of
things
in
a
common
world
the
law
of
sharing
of
which
i
have
said
so
much
may
when
perceived
engender
a
very
powerful
emotion
that
hegel
was
so
unusually
susceptible
to
this
emotion
throughout
his
life
that
its
gratification
became
his
supreme
end
and
made
him
tolerably
unscrupulous
as
to
the
means
he
employed
that
is
the
true
outcome
of
every
view
of
the
world
which
makes
infinity
and
continuity
to
be
its
essence
and
that
pessimistic
or
optimistic
attitudes
pertain
to
the
mere
accidental
subjectivity
of
the
moment
finally
that
the
identification
of
contradictories
so
far
from
being
the
process
which
hegel
supposes
is
really
a
process
passing
from
the
less
to
the
more
abstract
and
terminating
either
in
a
laugh
at
the
ultimate
nothingness
or
in
a
mood
of
vertiginous
amazement

a
meaningless
infinity

the
seeming
contradiction
between
the
infinitude

and
the
fact
that
it
is
all
finished
and
given
and
there
can
be
got
over
in
more
than
one
way
the
simplest
way
is
by
idealism
which
distinguishes
between
space
as
actual
and
space
as
potential
for
idealism
space
only
exists
so
far
as
it
is
represented
but
all
actually
represented
spaces
are
finite
it
is
only
possibly
representable
spaces
that
are
infinite
not
only
for
simplicity
sake
do
we
select
space
as
the
paragon
of
a
rationalizing
continuum

determines
the
relations
of
the
items
that
enter
it
in
a
far
more
intricate
way
than
does
time
in
a
far
more
fixed
way
than
does
the
ego
by
this
last
clause
i
mean
that
if
things
are
in
space
at
all
they
must
conform
to
geometry
while
the
being
in
an
ego
at
all
need
not
make
them
conform
to
logic

any
other
manner
of
rationality

lodge
itself

safely
as
any

one
can
not

of

of

at

can

what

the

said
a
scientific
friend
to
me
the
other
day
is
always
the
unclassified
residuum
round
about
the
accredited
and
orderly
facts
of
every
science
there
ever
floats
a
sort
of
of
exceptional
observations
of
occurrences
minute
and
irregular
and
seldom
met
with
which
it
always
proves
more
easy
to
ignore
than
to
attend
to
the
ideal
of
every
science
is
that
of
a
closed
and
completed
system
of
truth
the
charm
of
most
sciences
to
their
more
passive
disciples
consists
in
their
appearing
in
fact
to
wear
just
this
ideal
form
each
one
of
our
various
seems
to
offer
a
definite
head
of
classification
for
every
possible
phenomenon
of
the
sort
which
it
professes
to
cover
and
so
far
from
free
is
most
men
fancy
that
when
a
consistent
and
organized
scheme
of
this
sort
has
once
been
comprehended
and
assimilated
a
different
scheme
is
unimaginable
no
alternative
whether
to
whole
or
parts
can
any
longer
be
conceived
as
possible
phenomena
unclassifiable
within
the
system
are
therefore
paradoxical
absurdities
and
must
be
held
untrue
when
moreover
as
so
often
happens
the
reports
of
them
are
vague
and
indirect
when
they
come
as
mere
marvels
and
oddities
rather
than
as
things
of
serious
moment
one
neglects
or
denies
them
with
the
best
of
scientific
consciences
only
the
born
geniuses
let
themselves
be
worried
and
fascinated
by
these
outstanding
exceptions
and
get
no
peace
till
they
are
brought
within
the
fold
your
galileos
galvanis
fresnels

confounded
and

any
one
will
renovate
his
science
who
will
steadily
look
after
the
irregular
phenomena
and
when
the
science
is
renewed
its
new
formulas
often
have
more
of
the
voice
of
the
exceptions
in
them
than
of
what
were
supposed
to
be
the
rules
no
part
of

usually
been
treated
with
a
more
contemptuous
scientific
disregard

will
have
nothing
to
do

orthodox
psychology
turns
its
back
upon
them
medicine
sweeps
them
out
or
at
most
when
in
an
anecdotal
vein
records
a
few
of
them
as
of
the
imagination
a
phrase
of
mere
dismissal
whose
meaning
in
this
connection
it
is
impossible
to
make
precise
all
the
while
however
the
phenomena
are
there
lying
broadcast
over
the
surface
of
history
no
matter
where
you
open
its
pages
you
find
things
recorded
under
the
name
of
divinations
inspirations
demoniacal
possessions
apparitions
trances
ecstasies
miraculous
healings
and
productions
of
disease
and
occult

by
peculiar
individuals
over
persons
and
things
in
their

we
suppose
that
originated
in

and

with
mesmer
but
once
look
behind
the
pages
of
official
history
in
personal
memoirs
legal
documents
and
popular
narratives
and
books
of
anecdote
and
you
will
find
that
there
never
was
a
time
when
these
things
were
not
reported
just
as
abundantly
as
now
we
gentry
who
follow
the
stream
of
cosmopolitan
culture
exclusively
not
infrequently
stumble
upon
some
journal
or
some
voluminous
native
author
whose
names
are
never
heard
of
in
circle
but
who
number
their
readers
by
the
it
always
gives
us
a
little
shock
to
find
this
mass
of
human
beings
not
only
living
and
ignoring
us
and
all
our
gods
but
actually
reading
and
writing
and
cogitating
without
ever
a
thought
of
our
canons
and
authorities
well
a
public
no
less
large
keeps
and
transmits
from
generation
to
generation
the
traditions
and
practices
of
the
occult
but
academic
science
cares
as
little
for
its
beliefs
and
opinions
as
you
gentle
reader
care
for
those
of
the
readers
of
the
waverley
and
the
fireside
companion
to
no
one
type
of

is
it
given
to
discern
the
totality
of
truth
something
escapes
the
best
of
us
not
accidentally
but
systematically
and
because
we
have
a
twist
the
mind
and
the
mind
shy
from
each
other
facts
just
as
they
fly
from
each
other
temper
and
spirit
facts
are
there
only
for
those
who
have
a
mental
affinity
with
them
when
once
they
are
indisputably
ascertained
and
admitted
the
academic
and
critical
minds
are
by
far
the
best
fitted
ones
to
interpret
and
discuss
them
for
surely
to
pass
from
mystical
to
scientific
speculations
is
like
passing
from
lunacy
to
sanity
but
on
the
other
hand
if
there
is
anything
which
human
history
demonstrates
it
is
the
extreme
slowness
with
which
the
ordinary
academic
and
critical
mind
acknowledges
facts
to
exist
which
present
themselves
as
wild
facts
with
no
stall
or
or
as
facts
which
threaten
to
break
up
the
accepted
system
in
psychology
physiology
and
medicine
wherever
a
debate
between
the
mystics
and
the
scientifics
has
been
once
for
all
decided
it
is
the
mystics
who
have
usually
proved
to
be
right
about
the
while
the
scientifics
had
the
better
of
it
in
respect
to
the
theories
the
most
recent
and
flagrant
example
of
this
is
magnetism
whose
facts
were
stoutly
dismissed
as
a
pack
of
lies
by
academic
medical
science
the
world
over
until
the
theory
of
suggestion
was
found
for
them
when
they
were
admitted
to
be
so
excessively
and
dangerously
common
that
special
penal
laws
forsooth
must
be
passed
to
keep
all
persons
unequipped
with
medical
diplomas
from
taking
part
in
their
production
just
so
stigmatizations
invulnerabilities
instantaneous
cures
inspired
discourses
and
demoniacal
possessions
the
records
of
which
were
shelved
in
our
libraries
but
yesterday
in
the
alcove
headed
now
under
the
title
of
of
are
republished
reobserved
and
reported
with
an
even
too
credulous
avidity
repugnant
as
the
mystical
style
of
philosophizing
maybe
especially
when
there
is
no
sort
of
doubt
that
it
goes
with
a
gift
for
meeting
with
certain
kinds
of
phenomenal
experience
the
writer
of
these
pages
has
been
forced
in
the
past
few
years
to
this
admission
and
he
now
believes
that
he
who
will
pay
attention
to
facts
of
the
sort
dear
to
mystics
while
reflecting
upon
them
in
ways
will
be
in
the
best
possible
position
to
help
philosophy
it
is
a
circumstance
of
good
augury
that
certain
scientifically
trained
minds
in
all
countries
seem
drifting
to
the
same
conclusion
the
society
for
psychical
research
has
been
one
means
of
bringing
science
and
the
occult
together
in
england
and
america
and
believing
that
this
society
fulfils
a
function
which
though
limited
is
destined
to
be
not
unimportant
in
the
organization
of
human
knowledge
i
am
glad
to
give
a
brief
account
of
it
to
the
uninstructed
reader
according
to
the
newspaper
and
myth
and
idiotic
credulity
are
the
bond
of
sympathy
in
this
society
and
general
its
dynamic
principle
a
glance
at
the
membership
fails
however
to
corroborate
this
view
the
president
is
henry
sidgwick
known
by
his
other
deeds
as
the
most
incorrigibly
and
exasperatingly
critical
and
sceptical
mind
in
england
the
arthur
balfour
is
one
and
the
langley
secretary
of
the
smithsonian
institution
is
another
such
men
as
professor
lodge
the
eminent
english
physicist
and
professor
richet
the
eminent
french
physiologist
are
among
the
most
active
contributors
to
the
society
proceedings
and
through
the
catalogue
of
membership
are
sprinkled
names
honored
throughout
the
world
for
their
scientific
capacity
in
fact
were
i
asked
to
point
to
a
scientific
journal
where
and
suspicion
of
sources
of
error
might
be
seen
in
their
full
bloom
i
think
i
should
have
to
fall
back
on
the
proceedings
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
the
common
run
of
papers
say
on
physiological
subjects
which
one
finds
in
other
professional
organs
are
apt
to
show
a
far
lower
level
of
critical
consciousness
indeed
the
rigorous
canons
of
evidence
applied
a
few
years
ago
to
testimony
in
the
case
of
certain
led
to
the
secession
from
the
society
of
a
number
of
spiritualists
stainton
moses
and
wallace
among
others
thought
that
no
experiences
based
on
mere
eyesight
could
ever
have
a
chance
to
be
admitted
as
true
if
such
an
impossibly
exacting
standard
of
proof
were
insisted
on
in
every
case
the
as
i
shall
call
it
for
convenience
was
founded
in
by
a
number
of
gentlemen
foremost
among
whom
seem
to
have
been
professors
sidgwick
barrett
and
balfour
stewart
and
hutton
hensleigh
wedgwood
edmund
gurney
and
myers
their
purpose
was
twofold
first
to
carry
on
systematic
experimentation
with
hypnotic
subjects
mediums
clairvoyants
and
others
and
secondly
to
collect
evidence
concerning
apparitions
haunted
houses
and
similar
phenomena
which
are
incidentally
reported
but
which
from
their
fugitive
character
admit
of
no
deliberate
control
professor
sidgwick
in
his
introductory
address
insisted
that
the
divided
state
of
public
opinion
on
all
these
matters
was
a
scandal
to
science
absolute
disdain
on
grounds
characterizing
what
may
be
called
professional
opinion
while
indiscriminate
credulity
was
too
often
found
among
those
who
pretended
to
have
a
acquaintance
with
the
facts
as
a
sort
of
weather
bureau
for
accumulating
reports
of
such
meteoric
phenomena
as
apparitions
the
has
done
an
immense
amount
of
work
as
an
experimenting
body
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
completely
fulfilled
the
hopes
of
its
founders
the
reasons
for
this
lie
in
two
circumstances
first
the
clairvoyant
and
other
subjects
who
will
allow
themselves
to
be
experimented
upon
are
few
and
far
between
and
secondly
work
with
them
takes
an
immense
amount
of
time
and
has
had
to
be
carried
on
at
odd
intervals
by
members
engaged
in
other
pursuits
the
society
has
not
yet
been
rich
enough
to
control
the
undivided
services
of
skilled
experimenters
in
this
difficult
field
the
loss
of
the
lamented
edmund
gurney
who
more
than
any
one
else
had
leisure
to
devote
has
been
so
far
irreparable
but
were
there
no
experimental
work
at
all
and
were
the
nothing
but
a
for
catching
sporadic
apparitions
in
their
freshness
i
am
disposed
to
think
its
function
indispensable
in
the
scientific
organism
if
any
one
of
my
readers
spurred
by
the
thought
that
so
much
smoke
must
needs
betoken
fire
has
ever
looked
into
the
existing
literature
of
the
supernatural
for
proof
he
will
know
what
i
mean
this
literature
is
enormous
but
it
is
practically
worthless
for
evidential
purposes
facts
enough
are
cited
indeed
but
the
records
of
them
are
so
fallible
and
imperfect
that
at
most
they
lead
to
the
opinion
that
it
may
be
well
to
keep
a
window
open
upon
that
quarter
in
one
mind
in
the
proceedings
on
the
contrary
a
different
law
prevails
quality
and
not
mere
quantity
is
what
has
been
mainly
kept
in
mind
the
witnesses
where
possible
have
in
every
reported
case
been
personally
the
collateral
facts
have
been
looked
up
and
the
story
appears
with
its
precise
coefficient
of
evidential
worth
stamped
on
it
so
that
all
may
know
just
what
its
weight
as
proof
may
be
outside
of
these
proceedings
i
know
of
no
systematic
attempt
to
the
evidence
for
the
supernatural
this
makes
the
value
of
the
volumes
already
published
unique
and
i
firmly
believe
that
as
the
years
go
on
and
the
ground
covered
grows
still
wider
the
proceedings
will
more
and
more
tend
to
supersede
all
other
sources
of
information
concerning
phenomena
traditionally
deemed
occult
collections
of
this
sort
are
usually
best
appreciated
by
the
rising
generation
the
young
anthropologists
and
psychologists
who
will
soon
have
full
occupancy
of
the
stage
will
feel
how
great
a
scientific
scandal
it
has
been
to
leave
a
great
mass
of
human
experience
to
take
its
chances
between
vague
tradition
and
credulity
on
the
one
hand
and
dogmatic
denial
at
long
range
on
the
other
with
no
body
of
persons
extant
who
are
willing
and
competent
to
study
the
matter
with
both
patience
and
rigor
if
the
society
lives
long
enough
for
the
public
to
become
familiar
with
its
presence
so
that
any
apparition
or
house
or
person
infested
with
unaccountable
noises
or
disturbances
of
material
objects
will
as
a
matter
of
course
be
reported
to
its
officers
we
shall
doubtless
end
by
having
a
mass
of
facts
concrete
enough
to
theorize
upon
its
sustainers
therefore
should
accustom
themselves
to
the
idea
that
its
first
duty
is
simply
to
exist
from
year
to
year
and
perform
this
recording
function
well
though
no
conclusive
results
of
any
sort
emerge
at
first
all
our
learned
societies
have
begun
in
some
such
modest
way
but
one
can
not
by
mere
outward
organization
make
much
progress
in
matters
scientific
societies
can
back
men
of
genius
but
can
never
take
their
place
the
contrast
between
the
parent
society
and
the
american
branch
illustrates
this
in
england
a
little
group
of
men
with
enthusiasm
and
genius
for
the
work
supplied
the
nucleus
in
this
country
hodgson
had
to
be
imported
from
europe
before
any
tangible
progress
was
made
what
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
has
held
the
society
together
in
england
is
professor
extraordinary
gift
of
inspiring
confidence
in
diverse
sorts
of
people
such
tenacity
of
interest
in
the
result
and
such
absolute
impartiality
in
discussing
the
evidence
are
not
once
in
a
century
found
in
an
individual
his
obstinate
belief
that
there
is
something
yet
to
be
brought
to
light
communicates
patience
to
the
discouraged
his
constitutional
inability
to
draw
any
precipitate
conclusion
reassures
those
who
are
afraid
of
being
dupes
sidgwick
a
sister
by
the
way
of
the
great
arthur
balfour
is
a
worthy
ally
of
her
husband
in
this
matter
showing
a
similarly
rare
power
of
holding
her
judgment
in
suspense
and
a
keenness
of
observation
and
capacity
for
experimenting
with
human
subjects
which
are
rare
in
either
sex
the
of
the
society
as
originally
constituted
was
edmund
gurney
gurney
was
a
man
of
the
rarest
sympathies
and
gifts
although
like
carlyle
he
used
to
groan
under
the
burden
of
his
labors
he
yet
exhibited
a
colossal
power
of
dispatching
business
and
getting
through
drudgery
of
the
most
repulsive
kind
his
two
thick
volumes
on
of
the
living
collected
and
published
in
three
years
are
a
proof
of
this
besides
this
he
had
exquisite
artistic
instincts
and
his
massive
volume
on
power
of
sound
was
when
it
appeared
the
most
important
work
on
aesthetics
in
the
english
language
he
had
also
the
tenderest
heart
and
a
mind
of
rare
metaphysical
power
as
his
volumes
of
essays
quid
will
prove
to
any
reader
frederic
myers
already
well
known
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
english
essayists
is
the
of
the
of
the
value
of
myers
theoretic
writings
i
will
say
a
word
later
hodgson
the
american
secretary
is
distinguished
by
a
balance
of
mind
almost
as
rare
in
its
way
as
sidgwick
he
is
persuaded
of
the
reality
of
many
of
the
phenomena
called
spiritualistic
but
he
also
has
uncommon
keenness
in
detecting
error
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
advance
whether
it
will
give
him
more
satisfaction
to
confirm
or
to
smash
a
given
case
offered
to
his
examination
it
is
now
time
to
cast
a
brief
look
upon
the
actual
contents
of
these
proceedings
the
first
two
years
were
largely
taken
up
with
experiments
in
the
earliest
lot
of
these
were
made
with
the
daughters
of
a
clergyman
named
creery
and
convinced
balfour
stewart
barrett
myers
and
gurney
that
the
girls
had
an
inexplicable
power
of
guessing
names
and
objects
thought
of
by
other
persons
two
years
later
sidgwick
and
gurney
recommencing
experiments
with
the
same
girls
detected
them
signalling
to
each
other
it
is
true
that
for
the
most
part
the
conditions
of
the
earlier
series
had
excluded
signalling
and
it
is
also
possible
that
the
cheating
may
have
grafted
itself
on
what
was
originally
a
genuine
phenomenon
yet
gurney
was
wise
in
abandoning
the
entire
series
to
the
scepticism
of
the
reader
many
critics
of
the
seem
out
of
all
its
labors
to
have
heard
only
of
this
case
but
there
are
experiments
recorded
with
upwards
of
thirty
other
subjects
three
were
experimented
upon
at
great
length
during
the
first
two
years
one
was
smith
the
other
two
were
young
ladies
in
liverpool
in
the
employment
of
malcolm
guthrie
it
is
the
opinion
of
all
who
took
part
in
these
latter
experiments
that
sources
of
conscious
and
unconscious
deception
were
sufficiently
excluded
and
that
the
large
percentage
of
correct
reproductions
by
the
subjects
of
words
diagrams
and
sensations
occupying
other
consciousness
were
entirely
inexplicable
as
results
of
chance
the
witnesses
of
these
performances
were
in
fact
all
so
satisfied
of
the
genuineness
of
the
phenomena
that
has
figured
freely
in
the
papers
of
the
proceedings
and
in
gurney
book
on
phantasms
as
a
on
which
additional
hypotheses
might
be
built
no
mere
reader
can
be
blamed
however
if
he
demand
for
so
revolutionary
a
belief
a
more
overwhelming
bulk
of
testimony
than
has
yet
been
supplied
any
day
of
course
may
bring
in
fresh
experiments
in
successful
but
meanwhile
and
lacking
that
we
can
only
point
out
that
the
present
data
are
strengthened
in
the
flank
so
to
speak
by
all
observations
that
tend
to
corroborate
the
possibility
of
other
kindred
phenomena
such
as
telepathic
impression
clairvoyance
or
what
is
called
the
wider
genus
will
naturally
cover
the
narrower
species
with
its
credit
gurney
papers
on
hypnotism
must
be
mentioned
next
some
of
them
are
less
concerned
with
establishing
new
facts
than
with
analyzing
old
ones
but
omitting
these
we
find
that
in
the
line
of
pure
observation
gurney
claims
to
have
ascertained
in
more
than
one
subject
the
following
phenomenon
the
subject
hands
are
thrust
through
a
blanket
which
screens
the
operator
from
his
eyes
and
his
mind
is
absorbed
in
conversation
with
a
third
person
the
operator
meanwhile
points
with
his
finger
to
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
subject
which
finger
alone
responds
to
this
silent
selection
by
becoming
stiff
or
anaesthetic
as
the
case
may
be
the
interpretation
is
difficult
but
the
phenomenon
which
i
have
myself
witnessed
seems
authentic
another
observation
made
by
gurney
seems
to
prove
the
possibility
of
the
subject
mind
being
directly
influenced
by
the
operator
the
hypnotized
subject
responds
or
fails
to
respond
to
questions
asked
by
a
third
party
according
to
the
operator
silent
permission
or
refusal
of
course
in
these
experiments
all
obvious
sources
of
deception
were
excluded
but
gurney
most
important
contribution
to
our
knowledge
of
hypnotism
was
his
series
of
experiments
on
the
automatic
writing
of
subjects
who
had
received
suggestions
for
example
a
subject
during
trance
is
told
that
he
will
poke
the
fire
in
six
minutes
after
waking
on
being
waked
he
has
no
memory
of
the
order
but
while
he
is
engaged
in
conversation
his
hand
is
placed
on
a
which
immediately
writes
the
sentence
you
will
poke
the
fire
in
six
minutes
experiments
like
this
which
were
repeated
in
great
variety
seem
to
prove
that
below
the
upper
consciousness
the
hypnotic
consciousness
persists
engrossed
with
the
suggestion
and
able
to
express
itself
through
the
involuntarily
moving
hand
gurney
shares
therefore
with
janet
and
binet
the
credit
of
demonstrating
the
simultaneous
existence
of
two
different
strata
of
consciousness
ignorant
of
each
other
in
the
same
person
the
as
one
may
call
it
can
be
kept
on
tap
as
it
were
by
the
method
of
automatic
writing
this
discovery
marks
a
new
era
in
experimental
psychology
and
it
is
impossible
to
overrate
its
importance
but
gurney
greatest
piece
of
work
is
his
laborious
of
the
living
as
an
example
of
the
drudgery
stowed
away
in
the
volumes
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
in
looking
up
the
proofs
for
the
alleged
physical
phenomena
of
witchcraft
gurney
reports
a
careful
search
through
two
hundred
and
sixty
books
on
the
subject
with
the
result
of
finding
no
evidence
recorded
in
the
trials
except
the
confessions
of
the
victims
themselves
and
these
of
course
are
presumptively
due
to
either
torture
or
hallucination
this
statement
made
in
an
unobtrusive
note
is
only
one
instance
of
the
care
displayed
throughout
the
volumes
in
the
course
of
these
gurney
discusses
about
seven
hundred
cases
of
apparitions
which
he
collected
a
large
number
of
these
were
in
the
sense
of
coinciding
with
some
calamity
happening
to
the
person
who
appeared
gurney
explanation
is
that
the
mind
of
the
person
undergoing
the
calamity
was
at
that
moment
able
to
impress
the
mind
of
the
percipient
with
an
hallucination
apparitions
on
this
theory
may
be
called
facts
although
they
are
not
facts
in
order
to
test
the
likelihood
of
such
veridical
hallucinations
being
due
to
mere
chance
gurney
instituted
the
of
hallucinations
which
has
been
continued
with
the
result
of
obtaining
answers
from
over
thousand
persons
asked
at
random
in
different
countries
whether
when
in
good
health
and
awake
they
had
ever
heard
a
voice
seen
a
form
or
felt
a
touch
which
no
material
presence
could
account
for
the
result
seems
to
be
roughly
speaking
that
in
england
about
one
adult
in
ten
has
had
such
an
experience
at
least
once
in
his
life
and
that
of
the
experiences
themselves
a
large
number
coincide
with
some
distant
event
the
question
is
is
the
frequency
of
these
latter
cases
too
great
to
be
deemed
fortuitous
and
must
we
suppose
an
occult
connection
between
the
two
events
and
sidgwick
have
worked
out
this
problem
on
the
basis
of
the
english
returns
seventeen
thousand
in
number
with
a
care
and
thoroughness
that
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
their
conclusion
is
that
the
cases
where
the
apparition
of
a
person
is
seen
on
the
day
of
his
death
are
four
hundred
and
forty
times
too
numerous
to
be
ascribed
to
chance
the
reasoning
employed
to
calculate
this
number
is
simple
enough
if
there
be
only
a
fortuitous
connection
between
the
death
of
an
individual
and
the
occurrence
of
his
apparition
to
some
one
at
a
distance
the
death
is
no
more
likely
to
fall
on
the
same
day
as
the
apparition
than
it
is
to
occur
on
the
same
day
with
any
other
event
in
nature
but
the
that
any
individual
death
will
fall
on
any
given
day
marked
in
advance
by
some
other
event
is
just
equal
to
the
that
the
individual
will
die
at
all
on
any
specified
day
and
the
national
gives
that
probability
as
one
in
nineteen
thousand
if
then
when
the
death
of
a
person
coincides
with
an
apparition
of
the
same
person
the
coincidence
be
merely
fortuitous
it
ought
not
to
occur
oftener
than
once
in
nineteen
thousand
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
it
does
occur
according
to
the
census
once
in
cases
a
number
as
aforesaid
four
hundred
and
forty
times
too
great
the
american
census
of
some
seven
thousand
answers
gives
a
remarkably
similar
result
against
this
conclusion
the
only
rational
answer
that
i
can
see
is
that
the
data
are
still
too
few
that
the
net
was
not
cast
wide
enough
and
that
we
need
to
get
fair
averages
far
more
than
thousand
answers
to
the
census
question
this
may
of
course
be
true
though
it
seems
exceedingly
unlikely
and
in
our
own
thousand
answers
veridical
cases
may
possibly
have
heaped
themselves
unduly
the
next
topic
worth
mentioning
in
the
proceedings
is
the
discussion
of
the
physical
phenomena
of
mediumship
and
so
forth
by
sidgwick
hodgson
and
davey
this
so
far
as
it
goes
is
destructive
of
the
claims
of
all
the
mediums
examined
davey
himself
produced
fraudulent
of
the
highest
order
while
hodgson
a
in
his
confidence
reviewed
the
written
reports
of
the
series
of
his
other
sitters
all
of
them
intelligent
persons
and
showed
that
in
every
case
they
failed
to
see
the
essential
features
of
what
was
done
before
their
eyes
this
contribution
is
probably
the
most
damaging
document
concerning
evidence
that
has
ever
been
produced
another
substantial
bit
of
work
based
on
personal
observation
is
hodgson
report
on
madame
blavatsky
claims
to
physical
mediumship
this
is
adverse
to
the
lady
pretensions
and
although
some
of
madame
blavatsky
friends
make
light
of
it
it
is
a
stroke
from
which
her
reputation
will
not
recover
physical
mediumship
in
all
its
phases
has
fared
hard
in
the
proceedings
the
latest
case
reported
on
is
that
of
the
famous
eusapia
paladino
who
being
detected
in
fraud
at
cambridge
after
a
brilliant
career
of
success
on
the
continent
has
according
to
the
draconian
rules
of
method
which
govern
the
society
been
ruled
out
from
a
further
hearing
the
case
of
stainton
moses
on
the
other
hand
concerning
which
myers
has
brought
out
a
mass
of
unpublished
testimony
seems
to
escape
from
the
universal
condemnation
and
appears
to
force
upon
us
what
andrew
lang
calls
the
choice
between
a
moral
and
a
physical
miracle
in
the
case
of
piper
not
a
physical
but
a
trance
medium
we
seem
to
have
no
choice
offered
at
all
hodgson
and
others
have
made
prolonged
study
of
this
lady
trances
and
are
all
convinced
that
powers
of
cognition
are
displayed
therein
these
are
due
to
but
the
conditions
are
so
complex
that
a
dogmatic
decision
either
for
or
against
the
must
as
yet
be
postponed
one
of
the
most
important
experimental
contributions
to
the
proceedings
is
the
article
of
miss
on
vision
many
persons
who
look
fixedly
into
a
crystal
or
other
vaguely
luminous
surface
fall
into
a
kind
of
daze
and
see
visions
miss
has
this
susceptibility
in
a
remarkable
degree
and
is
moreover
an
unusually
intelligent
critic
she
reports
many
visions
which
can
only
be
described
as
apparently
clairvoyant
and
others
which
beautifully
fill
a
vacant
niche
incur
knowledge
of
subconscious
mental
operations
for
example
looking
into
the
crystal
before
breakfast
one
morning
she
reads
in
printed
characters
of
the
death
of
a
lady
of
her
acquaintance
the
date
and
other
circumstances
all
duly
appearing
in
type
startled
by
this
she
looks
at
the
of
the
previous
day
for
verification
and
there
among
the
deaths
are
the
identical
words
which
she
has
seen
on
the
same
page
of
the
times
are
other
items
which
she
remembers
reading
the
day
before
and
the
only
explanation
seems
to
be
that
her
eyes
then
inattentively
observed
so
to
speak
the
which
forthwith
fell
into
a
special
corner
of
her
memory
and
came
out
as
a
visual
hallucination
when
the
peculiar
modification
of
consciousness
induced
by
the
set
in
passing
from
papers
based
on
observation
to
papers
based
on
narrative
we
have
a
number
of
ghost
stories
sifted
by
sidgwick
and
discussed
by
myers
and
podmore
they
form
the
best
ghost
literature
i
know
of
from
the
point
of
view
of
emotional
interest
as
to
the
conclusions
drawn
sidgwick
is
rigorously
while
myers
and
podmore
show
themselves
respectively
hospitable
and
inhospitable
to
the
notion
that
such
stories
have
a
basis
of
objectivity
dependent
on
the
continued
existence
of
the
dead
i
must
close
my
gossip
about
the
proceedings
by
naming
what
after
all
seems
to
me
the
most
important
part
of
its
contents
this
is
the
long
series
of
articles
by
myers
on
what
he
now
calls
the
self
or
what
one
might
designate
as
consciousness
the
result
of
myers
learned
and
ingenious
studies
in
hypnotism
hallucinations
automatic
writing
mediumship
and
the
whole
series
of
allied
phenomena
is
a
conviction
which
he
expresses
in
the
following
terms
each
of
us
is
in
reality
an
abiding
psychical
entity
far
more
extensive
than
he
knows
an
individuality
which
can
never
express
itself
completely
through
any
corporeal
manifestation
the
self
manifests
itself
through
the
organism
but
there
is
always
some
part
of
the
self
unmanifested
and
always
as
it
seems
some
power
of
organic
expression
in
abeyance
or
reserve
the
ordinary
consciousness
myers
likens
to
the
visible
part
of
the
solar
spectrum
the
total
consciousness
is
like
that
spectrum
prolonged
by
the
inclusion
of
the
and
rays
in
the
psychic
spectrum
the
parts
may
embrace
a
far
wider
range
both
of
physiological
and
of
psychical
activity
than
is
open
to
our
ordinary
consciousness
and
memory
at
the
lower
end
we
have
the
extension
of
ecstatics
etc
in
the
upper
the
cognitions
of
the
whatever
the
judgment
of
the
future
may
be
on
myers
speculations
the
credit
will
always
remain
to
them
of
being
the
first
attempt
in
any
language
to
consider
the
phenomena
of
hallucination
hypnotism
automatism
double
personality
and
mediumship
as
connected
parts
of
one
whole
subject
all
constructions
in
this
field
must
be
provisional
and
it
is
as
something
provisional
that
myers
offers
us
his
formulations
but
thanks
to
him
we
begin
to
see
for
the
first
time
what
a
vast
interlocked
and
graded
system
these
phenomena
from
the
rudest
to
the
most
startling
form
quite
apart
from
myers
conclusions
his
methodical
treatment
of
them
by
classes
and
series
is
the
first
great
step
toward
overcoming
the
distaste
of
orthodox
science
to
look
at
them
at
all
one
reaction
on
hearsay
testimony
is
always
determined
by
one
own
experience
most
men
who
have
once
convinced
themselves
by
what
seems
to
them
a
careful
examination
that
any
one
species
of
the
supernatural
exists
begin
to
relax
their
vigilance
as
to
evidence
and
throw
the
doors
of
their
minds
more
or
less
wide
open
to
the
supernatural
along
its
whole
extent
to
a
mind
that
has
thus
made
its
the
minute
work
over
insignificant
cases
and
quiddling
discussion
of
values
of
which
the
society
reports
are
full
seems
insufferably
tedious
and
it
is
so
few
species
of
literature
are
more
truly
dull
than
reports
of
phantasms
taken
simply
by
themselves
as
separate
facts
to
stare
at
they
appear
so
devoid
of
meaning
and
sweep
that
even
were
they
certainly
true
one
would
be
tempted
to
leave
them
out
of
one
universe
for
being
so
idiotic
every
other
sort
of
fact
has
some
context
and
continuity
with
the
rest
of
nature
these
alone
are
contextless
and
discontinuous
hence
i
think
that
the
sort
of
loathing
no
milder
word
will
do
which
the
very
words
research
and
researcher
awaken
in
so
many
honest
scientific
breasts
is
not
only
natural
but
in
a
sense
praiseworthy
a
man
who
is
unable
himself
to
conceive
of
any
for
these
mental
meteors
can
only
suppose
that
gurney
myers
mood
in
dealing
with
them
must
be
that
of
silly
marvelling
at
so
many
detached
prodigies
and
such
prodigies
so
science
simply
falls
back
on
her
general
and
most
of
the
critics
of
the
proceedings
have
been
contented
to
oppose
to
the
phenomena
recorded
the
simple
presumption
that
in
some
way
or
other
the
reports
be
fallacious
for
so
far
as
the
order
of
nature
has
been
subjected
to
really
scientific
scrutiny
it
always
has
been
proved
to
run
the
other
way
but
the
oftener
one
is
forced
to
reject
an
alleged
sort
of
fact
by
the
use
of
this
mere
presumption
the
weaker
does
the
presumption
itself
get
to
be
and
one
might
in
course
of
time
use
up
one
presumptive
privileges
in
this
way
even
though
one
started
as
our
do
with
as
good
a
case
as
the
great
induction
of
psychology
that
all
our
knowledge
comes
by
the
use
of
our
eyes
and
ears
and
other
senses
and
we
must
remember
also
that
this
undermining
of
the
strength
of
a
presumption
by
reiterated
report
of
facts
to
the
contrary
does
not
logically
require
that
the
facts
in
question
should
all
be
well
proved
a
lot
of
rumors
in
the
air
against
a
business
man
credit
though
they
might
all
be
vague
and
no
one
of
them
amount
to
proof
that
he
is
unsound
would
certainly
weaken
the
of
his
soundness
and
all
the
more
would
they
have
this
effect
if
they
formed
what
gurney
called
a
fagot
and
not
a
chain
that
is
if
they
were
independent
of
one
another
and
came
from
different
quarters
now
the
evidence
for
telepathy
weak
and
strong
taken
just
as
it
comes
forms
a
fagot
and
not
a
chain
no
one
item
cites
the
content
of
another
item
as
part
of
its
own
proof
but
taken
together
the
items
have
a
certain
general
consistency
there
is
a
method
in
their
madness
so
to
speak
so
each
of
them
adds
presumptive
value
to
the
lot
and
cumulatively
as
no
candid
mind
can
fail
to
see
they
subtract
presumptive
force
from
the
orthodox
belief
that
there
can
be
nothing
in
any
one
intellect
that
has
not
come
in
through
ordinary
experiences
of
sense
but
it
is
a
miserable
thing
for
a
question
of
truth
to
be
confined
to
mere
presumption
and
with
no
decisive
thunderbolt
of
fact
to
clear
the
baffling
darkness
and
sooth
to
say
in
talking
so
much
of
the
merely
value
of
our
records
i
have
myself
been
wilfully
taking
the
point
of
view
of
the
scientific
disbeliever
and
making
an
plea
my
own
point
of
view
is
different
for
me
the
thunderbolt
fallen
and
the
orthodox
belief
has
not
merely
had
its
presumption
weakened
but
the
truth
itself
of
the
belief
is
decisively
overthrown
if
i
may
employ
the
language
of
the
professional
a
universal
proposition
can
be
made
untrue
by
a
particular
instance
if
you
wish
to
upset
the
law
that
all
crows
are
black
you
must
not
seek
to
show
that
no
crows
are
it
is
enough
if
you
prove
one
single
crow
to
be
white
my
own
white
crow
is
piper
in
the
trances
of
this
medium
i
can
not
resist
the
conviction
that
knowledge
appears
which
she
has
never
gained
by
the
ordinary
waking
use
of
her
eyes
and
ears
and
wits
what
the
source
of
this
knowledge
may
be
i
know
not
and
have
not
the
glimmer
of
an
explanatory
suggestion
to
make
but
from
admitting
the
fact
of
such
knowledge
i
can
see
no
escape
so
when
i
turn
to
the
rest
of
the
evidence
ghosts
and
all
i
can
not
carry
with
me
the
irreversibly
negative
bias
of
the
scientific
mind
with
its
presumption
as
to
what
the
true
order
of
nature
ought
to
be
i
feel
as
if
though
the
evidence
be
flimsy
in
spots
it
may
nevertheless
collectively
carry
heavy
weight
the
rigorously
scientific
mind
may
in
truth
easily
overshoot
the
mark
science
means
first
of
all
a
certain
dispassionate
method
to
suppose
that
it
means
a
certain
set
of
results
that
one
should
pin
one
faith
upon
and
hug
forever
is
sadly
to
mistake
its
genius
and
degrades
the
scientific
body
to
the
status
of
a
sect
we
all
scientists
and
live
on
some
inclined
plane
of
credulity
the
plane
tips
one
way
in
one
man
another
way
in
another
and
may
he
whose
plane
tips
in
no
way
be
the
first
to
cast
a
stone
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
trances
i
speak
of
have
broken
down
for
my
own
mind
the
limits
of
the
admitted
order
of
nature
science
so
far
as
science
denies
such
exceptional
occurrences
lies
prostrate
in
the
dust
for
me
and
the
most
urgent
intellectual
need
which
i
feel
at
present
is
that
science
be
built
up
again
in
a
form
in
which
such
things
may
have
a
positive
place
science
like
life
feeds
on
its
own
decay
new
facts
burst
old
rules
then
newly
divined
conceptions
bind
old
and
new
together
into
a
reconciling
law
and
here
is
the
real
instructiveness
of
myers
and
work
they
are
trying
with
the
utmost
conscientiousness
to
find
a
reconciling
conception
which
shall
subject
the
old
laws
of
nature
to
the
smallest
possible
strain
myers
uses
that
method
of
gradual
approach
which
has
performed
such
wonders
in
darwin
hands
when
darwin
met
a
fact
which
seemed
a
poser
to
his
theory
his
regular
custom
as
i
have
heard
an
able
colleague
say
was
to
fill
in
all
round
it
with
smaller
facts
as
a
wagoner
might
heap
dirt
round
a
big
rock
in
the
road
and
thus
get
his
team
over
without
upsetting
so
myers
starting
from
the
most
ordinary
facts
of
inattentive
consciousness
follows
this
clue
through
a
long
series
which
terminates
in
ghosts
and
seeks
to
show
that
these
are
but
extreme
manifestations
of
a
common
truth
the
truth
that
the
invisible
segments
of
our
minds
are
susceptible
under
rarely
realized
conditions
of
acting
and
being
acted
upon
by
the
invisible
segments
of
other
conscious
lives
this
may
not
be
ultimately
true
for
the
theosophists
with
their
astral
bodies
and
the
like
may
for
aught
i
now
know
prove
to
be
on
the
correcter
trail
but
no
one
can
deny
that
it
is
in
good
scientific
form
for
science
always
takes
a
known
kind
of
phenomenon
and
tries
to
extend
its
range
i
have
myself
as
american
agent
for
the
census
collected
hundreds
of
cases
of
hallucination
in
healthy
persons
the
result
is
to
make
me
feel
that
we
all
have
potentially
a
self
which
may
make
at
any
time
irruption
into
our
ordinary
lives
at
its
lowest
it
is
only
the
depository
of
our
forgotten
memories
at
its
highest
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
at
all
take
for
instance
a
series
of
cases
during
sleep
many
persons
have
something
in
them
which
measures
the
flight
of
time
better
than
the
waking
self
does
it
wakes
them
at
a
preappointed
hour
it
acquaints
them
with
the
moment
when
they
first
awake
it
may
produce
an
hallucination
as
in
a
lady
who
informs
me
that
at
the
instant
of
waking
she
has
a
vision
of
her
with
the
hands
pointing
as
she
has
often
verified
to
the
exact
time
it
may
be
the
feeling
that
some
physiological
period
has
elapsed
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
subconscious
a
subconscious
something
may
also
preserve
experiences
to
which
we
do
not
openly
attend
a
lady
taking
her
lunch
in
town
finds
herself
without
her
purse
instantly
a
sense
comes
over
her
of
rising
from
the
and
hearing
her
purse
drop
upon
the
floor
on
reaching
home
she
finds
nothing
under
the
table
but
summons
the
servant
to
say
where
she
has
put
the
purse
the
servant
produces
it
saying
how
did
you
know
where
it
was
you
rose
and
left
the
room
as
if
you
did
know
you
dropped
it
the
same
subconscious
something
may
recollect
what
we
have
forgotten
a
lady
accustomed
to
taking
salicylate
of
soda
for
muscular
rheumatism
wakes
one
early
winter
morning
with
an
aching
neck
in
the
twilight
she
takes
what
she
supposes
to
be
her
customary
powder
from
a
drawer
dissolves
it
in
a
glass
of
water
and
is
about
to
drink
it
down
when
she
feels
a
sharp
slap
on
her
shoulder
and
hears
a
voice
in
her
ear
saying
taste
it
on
examination
she
finds
she
has
got
a
morphine
powder
by
mistake
the
natural
interpretation
is
that
a
sleeping
memory
of
the
morphine
powders
awoke
in
this
way
a
like
explanation
offers
itself
as
most
plausible
for
the
following
case
a
lady
with
little
time
to
catch
the
train
and
the
expressman
about
to
call
is
excitedly
looking
for
the
lost
key
of
a
packed
trunk
hurrying
upstairs
with
a
bunch
of
keys
proved
useless
in
her
hand
she
hears
an
voice
distinctly
say
try
the
key
of
the
being
tried
it
fits
this
also
may
well
have
been
the
effect
of
forgotten
experience
now
the
effect
is
doubtless
due
to
the
same
hallucinatory
mechanism
but
the
source
is
less
easily
assigned
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
cases
a
lady
for
instance
goes
after
breakfast
to
see
about
one
of
her
servants
who
has
become
ill
over
night
she
is
startled
at
distinctly
reading
over
the
bedroom
door
in
gilt
letters
the
word
the
doctor
is
sent
for
and
ere
long
pronounces
to
be
the
disease
although
the
lady
says
the
thought
of
the
having
never
entered
my
mind
till
i
saw
the
apparent
inscription
then
come
other
cases
of
warning
for
example
that
of
a
youth
sitting
in
a
wagon
under
a
shed
who
suddenly
hears
his
dead
mother
voice
say
stephen
get
away
from
here
quick
and
jumps
out
just
in
time
to
see
the
fall
after
this
come
the
experiences
of
persons
appearing
to
distant
friends
at
or
near
the
hour
of
death
then
too
we
have
the
and
utterances
which
may
appear
astonishingly
profuse
and
continuous
and
maintain
a
fairly
high
intellectual
level
for
all
these
higher
phenomena
it
seems
to
me
that
while
the
proximate
mechanism
is
that
of
it
is
straining
an
hypothesis
unduly
to
name
any
ordinary
subconscious
mental
operation
such
as
expectation
recollection
or
inference
from
inattentive
perception
as
the
ultimate
cause
that
starts
it
up
it
is
far
better
tactics
if
you
wish
to
get
rid
of
mystery
to
brand
the
narratives
themselves
as
unworthy
of
trust
the
trustworthiness
of
most
of
them
is
to
my
own
mind
far
from
proved
and
yet
in
the
light
of
the
which
is
proved
it
seems
as
if
they
might
well
all
be
members
of
a
natural
kind
of
fact
of
which
we
do
not
yet
know
the
full
extent
thousands
of
sensitive
organizations
in
the
united
states
live
as
steadily
in
the
light
of
these
experiences
and
are
as
indifferent
to
modern
science
as
if
they
lived
in
bohemia
in
the
twelfth
century
they
are
indifferent
to
science
because
science
is
so
callously
indifferent
to
their
experiences
although
in
its
essence
science
only
stands
for
a
method
and
for
no
fixed
belief
yet
as
habitually
taken
both
by
its
votaries
and
outsiders
it
is
identified
with
a
certain
fixed
belief
the
belief
that
the
hidden
order
of
nature
is
mechanical
exclusively
and
that
categories
are
irrational
ways
of
conceiving
and
explaining
even
such
things
as
human
life
now
this
mechanical
rationalism
as
one
may
call
it
makes
if
it
becomes
one
only
way
of
thinking
a
violent
breach
with
the
ways
of
thinking
that
have
played
the
greatest
part
in
human
history
religious
thinking
ethical
thinking
poetical
thinking
teleological
emotional
sentimental
thinking
what
one
might
call
the
personal
view
of
life
to
distinguish
it
from
the
impersonal
and
mechanical
and
the
romantic
view
of
life
to
distinguish
it
from
the
rationalistic
view
have
been
and
even
still
are
outside
of
scientific
circles
the
dominant
forms
of
thought
but
for
mechanical
rationalism
personality
is
an
insubstantial
illusion
the
chronic
belief
of
mankind
that
events
may
happen
for
the
sake
of
their
personal
significance
is
an
abomination
and
the
notions
of
our
grandfathers
about
oracles
and
omens
divinations
and
apparitions
miraculous
changes
of
heart
and
wonders
worked
by
inspired
persons
answers
to
prayer
and
providential
leadings
are
a
fabric
absolutely
baseless
a
mass
of
sheer
now
of
course
we
must
all
admit
that
the
excesses
to
which
the
romantic
and
personal
view
of
nature
may
lead
if
wholly
unchecked
by
impersonal
rationalism
are
direful
central
african
is
one
of
unchecked
romanticism
fruits
one
ought
accordingly
to
sympathize
with
that
abhorrence
of
romanticism
as
a
sufficient
one
ought
to
understand
that
lively
intolerance
of
the
least
grain
of
romanticism
in
the
views
of
life
of
other
people
which
are
such
characteristic
marks
of
those
who
follow
the
scientific
professions
our
debt
to
science
is
literally
boundless
and
our
gratitude
for
what
is
positive
in
her
teachings
must
be
correspondingly
immense
but
the
proceedings
have
it
seems
to
me
conclusively
proved
one
thing
to
the
candid
reader
and
that
is
that
the
verdict
of
pure
insanity
of
gratuitous
preference
for
error
of
superstition
without
an
excuse
which
the
scientists
of
our
day
are
led
by
their
intellectual
training
to
pronounce
upon
the
entire
thought
of
the
past
is
a
most
shallow
verdict
the
personal
and
romantic
view
of
life
has
other
roots
besides
wanton
exuberance
of
imagination
and
perversity
of
heart
it
is
perennially
fed
by
of
whatever
the
ulterior
interpretation
of
those
facts
may
prove
to
be
and
at
no
time
in
human
history
would
it
have
been
less
easy
than
now
at
most
times
it
would
have
been
much
more
easy
for
advocates
with
a
little
industry
to
collect
in
its
favor
an
array
of
contemporary
documents
as
good
as
those
which
our
publications
present
these
documents
all
relate
to
real
experiences
of
persons
these
experiences
have
three
characters
in
common
they
are
capricious
discontinuous
and
not
easily
controlled
they
require
peculiar
persons
for
their
production
their
significance
seems
to
be
wholly
for
personal
life
those
who
preferentially
attend
to
them
and
still
more
those
who
are
individually
subject
to
them
not
only
easily
may
find
but
are
logically
bound
to
find
in
them
valid
arguments
for
their
romantic
and
personal
conception
of
the
world
course
through
my
slight
participation
in
the
investigations
of
the
i
have
become
acquainted
with
numbers
of
persons
of
this
sort
for
whom
the
very
word
has
become
a
name
of
reproach
for
reasons
that
i
now
both
understand
and
respect
it
is
the
intolerance
of
science
for
such
phenomena
as
we
are
studying
her
peremptory
denial
either
of
their
existence
or
of
their
significance
except
as
proofs
of
absolute
innate
folly
that
has
set
science
so
apart
from
the
common
sympathies
of
the
race
i
confess
that
it
is
on
this
its
humanizing
mission
that
the
society
best
claim
to
the
gratitude
of
our
generation
seems
to
me
to
depend
it
has
restored
continuity
to
history
it
has
shown
some
reasonable
basis
for
the
most
superstitious
aberrations
of
the
foretime
it
has
bridged
the
chasm
healed
the
hideous
rift
that
science
taken
in
a
certain
narrow
way
has
shot
into
the
human
world
i
will
even
go
one
step
farther
when
from
our
present
advanced
standpoint
we
look
back
upon
the
past
stages
of
human
thought
whether
it
be
scientific
thought
or
theological
thought
we
are
amazed
that
a
universe
which
appears
to
us
of
so
vast
and
mysterious
a
complication
should
ever
have
seemed
to
any
one
so
little
and
plain
a
thing
whether
it
be
descartes
world
or
newton
whether
it
be
that
of
the
materialists
of
the
last
century
or
that
of
the
bridgewater
treatises
of
our
own
it
always
looks
the
same
to
us
incredibly
perspectiveless
and
short
even
lyell
faraday
mill
and
darwin
consciousness
of
their
respective
subjects
are
already
beginning
to
put
on
an
infantile
and
innocent
look
is
it
then
likely
that
the
science
of
our
own
day
will
escape
the
common
doom
that
the
minds
of
its
votaries
will
never
look
to
the
grandchildren
of
the
latter
it
would
be
folly
to
suppose
so
yet
if
we
are
to
judge
by
the
analogy
of
the
past
when
our
science
once
becomes
it
will
be
more
for
its
omissions
of
fact
for
its
ignorance
of
whole
ranges
and
orders
of
complexity
in
the
phenomena
to
be
explained
than
for
any
fatal
lack
in
its
spirit
and
principles
the
spirit
and
principles
of
science
are
mere
affairs
of
method
there
is
nothing
in
them
that
need
hinder
science
from
dealing
successfully
with
a
world
in
which
personal
forces
are
the
of
new
effects
the
only
form
of
thing
that
we
directly
encounter
the
only
experience
that
we
concretely
have
is
our
own
personal
life
the
only
complete
category
of
our
thinking
our
professors
of
philosophy
tell
us
is
the
category
of
personality
every
other
category
being
one
of
the
abstract
elements
of
that
and
this
systematic
denial
on
science
part
of
personality
as
a
condition
of
events
this
rigorous
belief
that
in
its
own
essential
and
innermost
nature
our
world
is
a
strictly
impersonal
world
may
conceivably
as
the
whirligig
of
time
goes
round
prove
to
be
the
very
defect
that
our
descendants
will
be
most
surprised
at
in
our
own
boasted
science
the
omission
that
to
their
eyes
will
most
tend
to
make
it
look
perspectiveless
