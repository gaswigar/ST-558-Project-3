the
rise
of
silas
lapham
by
william
dean
howells
jtable
i
when
bartley
hubbard
went
to
interview
silas
lapham
for
the
solid
men
of
boston
series
which
he
undertook
to
finish
up
in
the
events
after
he
replaced
their
original
projector
on
that
newspaper
lapham
received
him
in
his
private
office
by
previous
appointment
walk
right
in
he
called
out
to
the
journalist
whom
he
caught
sight
of
through
the
door
of
the
he
did
not
rise
from
the
desk
at
which
he
was
writing
but
he
gave
bartley
his
left
hand
for
welcome
and
he
rolled
his
large
head
in
the
direction
of
a
vacant
chair
sit
down
i
be
with
you
in
just
half
a
minute
take
your
time
said
bartley
with
the
ease
he
instantly
felt
in
no
hurry
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
laid
it
on
his
knee
and
began
to
sharpen
a
pencil
there
lapham
pounded
with
his
great
hairy
fist
on
the
envelope
he
had
been
addressing
william
he
called
out
and
he
handed
the
letter
to
a
boy
who
came
to
get
it
i
want
that
to
go
right
away
well
sir
he
continued
wheeling
round
in
his
and
facing
bartley
seated
so
near
that
their
knees
almost
touched
so
you
want
my
life
death
and
christian
sufferings
do
you
young
man
that
what
i
after
said
bartley
your
money
or
your
life
i
guess
you
would
want
my
life
without
the
money
said
lapham
as
if
he
were
willing
to
prolong
these
moments
of
preparation
take
both
bartley
suggested
do
want
your
money
without
your
life
if
you
come
to
that
but
you
just
one
million
times
more
interesting
to
the
public
than
if
you
had
a
dollar
and
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
lapham
there
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
no
said
lapham
somewhat
absently
he
put
out
his
huge
foot
and
pushed
the
door
shut
between
his
little
den
and
the
in
their
larger
den
outside
in
personal
appearance
wrote
bartley
in
the
sketch
for
which
he
now
studied
his
subject
while
he
waited
patiently
for
him
to
continue
silas
lapham
is
a
fine
type
of
the
successful
american
he
has
a
square
bold
chin
only
partially
concealed
by
the
short
beard
growing
to
the
edges
of
his
firmly
closing
lips
his
nose
is
short
and
straight
his
forehead
good
but
broad
rather
than
high
his
eyes
blue
and
with
a
light
in
them
that
is
kindly
or
sharp
according
to
his
mood
he
is
of
medium
height
and
fills
an
average
with
a
solid
bulk
which
on
the
day
of
our
interview
was
unpretentiously
clad
in
a
business
suit
of
blue
serge
his
head
droops
somewhat
from
a
short
neck
which
does
not
trouble
itself
to
rise
far
from
a
pair
of
massive
shoulders
i
do
know
as
i
know
just
where
you
want
me
to
begin
said
lapham
might
begin
with
your
birth
that
where
most
of
us
begin
replied
bartley
a
gleam
of
humorous
appreciation
shot
into
lapham
blue
eyes
i
did
know
whether
you
wanted
me
to
go
quite
so
far
back
as
that
he
said
but
there
no
disgrace
in
having
been
born
and
i
was
born
in
the
state
of
vermont
pretty
well
up
under
the
canada
line
so
well
up
in
fact
that
i
came
very
near
being
an
adoptive
citizen
for
i
was
bound
to
be
an
american
of
some
sort
from
the
word
go
that
was
about
well
let
me
see
pretty
near
sixty
years
ago
this
is
and
that
was
well
say
i
years
old
and
i
lived
too
not
an
hour
of
waste
time
about
me
anywheres
i
was
born
on
a
farm
and
worked
in
the
fields
summers
and
went
to
school
winters
regulation
thing
bartley
cut
in
regulation
thing
said
lapham
accepting
this
irreverent
version
of
his
history
somewhat
dryly
parents
poor
of
course
suggested
the
journalist
any
barefoot
business
early
deprivations
of
any
kind
that
would
encourage
the
youthful
reader
to
go
and
do
likewise
orphan
myself
you
know
said
bartley
with
a
smile
of
cynical
lapham
looked
at
him
silently
and
then
said
with
quiet
i
guess
if
you
see
these
things
as
a
joke
my
life
wo
interest
you
oh
yes
it
will
returned
bartley
unabashed
you
see
come
out
all
right
and
in
fact
it
did
so
in
the
interview
which
bartley
printed
lapham
he
wrote
passed
rapidly
over
the
story
of
his
early
life
its
poverty
and
its
hardships
sweetened
however
by
the
recollections
of
a
devoted
mother
and
a
father
who
if
somewhat
her
inferior
in
education
was
no
less
ambitious
for
the
advancement
of
his
children
they
were
quiet
unpretentious
people
religious
after
the
fashion
of
that
time
and
of
sterling
morality
and
they
taught
their
children
the
simple
virtues
of
the
old
testament
and
poor
almanac
bartley
could
not
deny
himself
this
gibe
but
he
trusted
to
unliterary
habit
of
mind
for
his
security
in
making
it
and
most
other
people
would
consider
it
sincere
reporter
rhetoric
you
know
he
explained
to
lapham
that
we
have
to
look
at
all
these
facts
as
material
and
we
get
the
habit
of
classifying
them
sometimes
a
leading
question
will
draw
out
a
whole
line
of
facts
that
a
man
himself
would
never
think
of
he
went
on
to
put
several
queries
and
it
was
from
lapham
answers
that
he
generalised
the
history
of
his
childhood
lapham
although
he
did
not
dwell
on
his
boyish
trials
and
struggles
spoke
of
them
with
deep
feeling
and
an
abiding
sense
of
their
reality
this
was
what
he
added
in
the
interview
and
by
the
time
he
had
got
lapham
past
the
period
where
risen
americans
are
all
pathetically
alike
in
their
narrow
circumstances
their
sufferings
and
their
aspirations
he
had
beguiled
him
into
forgetfulness
of
the
check
he
had
received
and
had
him
talking
again
in
perfect
enjoyment
of
his
autobiography
yes
sir
said
lapham
in
a
strain
which
bartley
was
careful
not
to
interrupt
again
a
man
never
sees
all
that
his
mother
has
been
to
him
till
it
too
late
to
let
her
know
that
he
sees
it
why
my
mother
he
stopped
it
gives
me
a
lump
in
the
throat
he
said
apologetically
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
then
he
went
on
she
was
a
little
frail
thing
not
bigger
than
a
intermediate
but
she
did
the
whole
work
of
a
family
of
boys
and
boarded
the
hired
men
besides
she
cooked
swept
washed
ironed
made
and
mended
from
daylight
till
dark
and
from
dark
till
daylight
i
was
going
to
say
for
i
do
know
how
she
got
any
time
for
sleep
but
i
suppose
she
did
she
got
time
to
go
to
church
and
to
teach
us
to
read
the
bible
and
to
misunderstand
it
in
the
old
way
she
was
good
but
it
ai
her
on
her
knees
in
church
that
comes
back
to
me
so
much
like
the
sight
of
an
angel
as
her
on
her
knees
before
me
at
night
washing
my
poor
dirty
little
feet
that
i
run
bare
in
all
day
and
making
me
decent
for
bed
there
were
six
of
us
boys
it
seems
to
me
we
were
all
of
a
size
and
she
was
just
so
careful
with
all
of
us
i
can
feel
her
hands
on
my
feet
yet
bartley
looked
at
lapham
no
boots
and
softly
whistled
through
his
teeth
we
were
patched
all
over
but
we
ragged
i
do
know
how
she
got
through
it
she
did
seem
to
think
it
was
anything
and
i
guess
it
was
no
more
than
my
father
expected
of
her
he
worked
like
a
horse
in
doors
and
out
up
at
daylight
feeding
the
stock
and
groaning
round
all
day
with
his
rheumatism
but
not
stopping
bartley
hid
a
yawn
over
his
and
probably
if
he
could
have
spoken
his
mind
he
would
have
suggested
to
lapham
that
he
was
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
interviewing
his
ancestry
but
bartley
had
learned
to
practise
a
patience
with
his
victims
which
he
did
not
always
feel
and
to
feign
an
interest
in
their
digressions
till
he
could
bring
them
up
with
a
round
turn
i
tell
you
said
lapham
jabbing
the
point
of
his
penknife
into
the
on
the
desk
before
him
when
i
hear
women
complaining
nowadays
that
their
lives
are
stunted
and
empty
i
want
to
tell
about
my
mother
life
i
could
paint
it
out
for
bartley
saw
his
opportunity
at
the
word
paint
and
cut
in
and
you
say
lapham
that
you
discovered
this
mineral
paint
on
the
old
farm
yourself
lapham
acquiesced
in
the
return
to
business
i
did
discover
it
he
said
scrupulously
my
father
found
it
one
day
in
a
hole
made
by
a
tree
blowing
down
there
it
was
lying
loose
in
the
pit
and
sticking
to
the
roots
that
had
pulled
up
a
big
cake
of
dirt
with
i
know
what
give
him
the
idea
that
there
was
money
in
it
but
he
did
think
so
from
the
start
i
guess
if
they
had
the
word
in
those
days
they
considered
him
pretty
much
of
a
crank
about
it
he
was
trying
as
long
as
he
lived
to
get
that
paint
introduced
but
he
could
make
it
go
the
country
was
so
poor
they
could
paint
their
houses
with
anything
and
father
had
any
facilities
it
got
to
be
a
kind
of
joke
with
us
and
i
guess
that
did
as
much
as
any
one
thing
to
make
us
boys
clear
out
as
soon
as
we
got
old
enough
all
my
brothers
went
west
and
took
up
land
but
i
hung
on
to
new
england
and
i
hung
on
to
the
old
farm
not
because
the
was
on
it
but
because
the
old
house
was
and
the
graves
well
said
lapham
as
if
unwilling
to
give
himself
too
much
credit
there
would
been
any
market
for
it
anyway
you
can
go
through
that
part
of
the
state
and
buy
more
farms
than
you
can
shake
a
stick
at
for
less
money
than
it
cost
to
build
the
barns
on
of
course
it
turned
out
a
good
thing
i
keep
the
old
house
up
in
good
shape
and
we
spend
a
month
or
so
there
every
summer
m
wife
kind
of
likes
it
and
the
girls
pretty
place
sightly
all
round
it
i
got
a
force
of
men
at
work
there
the
whole
time
and
i
got
a
man
and
his
wife
in
the
house
had
a
family
meeting
there
last
year
the
whole
connection
from
out
west
there
lapham
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
down
a
large
warped
unframed
photograph
from
the
top
of
his
desk
passing
his
hand
over
it
and
then
blowing
vigorously
upon
it
to
clear
it
of
the
dust
there
we
are
all
of
us
i
do
need
to
look
twice
at
you
said
bartley
putting
his
finger
on
one
of
the
heads
well
that
bill
said
lapham
with
a
gratified
laugh
he
about
as
brainy
as
any
of
us
i
guess
he
one
of
their
leading
lawyers
out
dubuque
way
been
judge
of
the
common
pleas
once
or
twice
his
son
just
graduated
at
yale
alongside
of
my
youngest
girl
chap
ai
he
she
a
chap
said
bartley
with
prompt
irreverence
he
hastened
to
add
at
the
frown
which
gathered
between
lapham
eyes
what
a
beautiful
creature
she
is
what
a
lovely
refined
sensitive
face
and
she
looks
good
too
she
is
good
said
the
father
relenting
and
after
all
that
about
the
best
thing
in
a
woman
said
the
potential
reprobate
if
my
wife
was
good
enough
to
keep
both
of
us
straight
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
me
my
other
daughter
said
lapham
indicating
a
girl
with
eyes
that
showed
large
and
a
face
of
singular
gravity
mis
lapham
he
continued
touching
his
effigy
with
his
little
finger
my
brother
willard
and
his
family
farm
at
kankakee
hazard
lapham
and
his
wife
baptist
preacher
in
kansas
jim
and
his
three
girls
milling
business
at
minneapolis
ben
and
his
family
practising
medicine
in
fort
wayne
the
figures
were
clustered
in
an
irregular
group
in
front
of
an
old
whose
original
ugliness
had
been
smartened
up
with
a
coat
of
lapham
own
paint
and
heightened
with
an
incongruous
piazza
the
photographer
had
not
been
able
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
were
all
decent
sensible
people
with
a
very
fair
share
of
beauty
among
the
young
girls
some
of
these
were
extremely
pretty
in
fact
he
had
put
them
into
awkward
and
constrained
attitudes
of
course
and
they
all
looked
as
if
they
had
the
instrument
of
torture
which
photographers
call
a
under
their
occiputs
here
and
there
an
elderly
lady
face
was
a
mere
blur
and
some
of
the
younger
children
had
twitched
themselves
into
wavering
shadows
and
might
have
passed
for
of
their
own
little
ghosts
it
was
the
standard
photograph
in
which
most
americans
have
figured
at
some
time
or
other
and
lapham
exhibited
a
just
satisfaction
in
it
i
presume
he
mused
aloud
as
he
put
it
back
on
top
of
his
desk
that
we
soon
get
together
again
all
of
us
and
you
say
suggested
bartley
that
you
stayed
right
along
on
the
old
place
when
the
rest
cleared
out
west
no
said
lapham
with
a
long
loud
drawl
i
cleared
out
west
too
first
off
went
to
texas
texas
was
all
the
cry
in
those
days
but
i
got
enough
of
the
lone
star
in
about
three
months
and
i
come
back
with
the
idea
that
vermont
was
good
enough
for
me
fatted
calf
business
queried
bartley
with
his
pencil
poised
above
his
i
presume
they
were
glad
to
see
me
said
lapham
with
dignity
mother
he
added
gently
died
that
winter
and
i
stayed
on
with
father
i
buried
him
in
the
spring
and
then
i
came
down
to
a
little
place
called
lumberville
and
picked
up
what
jobs
i
could
get
i
worked
round
at
the
and
i
was
ostler
a
while
at
the
hotel
i
always
did
like
a
good
horse
well
i
exactly
a
college
graduate
and
i
went
to
school
odd
times
i
got
to
driving
the
stage
after
while
and
by
and
by
i
bought
the
stage
and
run
the
business
myself
then
i
hired
the
and
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
then
i
got
married
yes
said
lapham
with
pride
i
married
the
we
did
pretty
well
with
the
hotel
and
my
wife
she
was
always
at
me
to
paint
up
well
i
put
it
off
and
put
it
off
as
a
man
will
till
one
day
i
give
in
and
says
i
let
paint
up
why
pert
name
persis
got
a
whole
out
on
the
farm
let
go
out
and
look
at
it
so
we
drove
out
i
let
the
place
for
dollars
a
year
to
a
kind
of
a
kanuck
that
had
come
down
that
way
and
i
hated
to
see
the
house
with
him
in
it
but
we
drove
out
one
saturday
afternoon
and
we
brought
back
about
a
bushel
of
the
stuff
in
the
and
i
tried
it
crude
and
i
tried
it
burnt
and
i
liked
it
she
liked
it
too
there
any
painter
by
trade
in
the
village
and
i
mixed
it
myself
well
sir
that
tavern
got
that
coat
of
paint
on
it
yet
and
it
hai
ever
had
any
other
and
i
do
know
it
ever
will
well
you
know
i
felt
as
if
it
was
a
kind
of
harumscarum
experiment
all
the
while
and
i
presume
i
should
have
tried
it
but
i
kind
of
liked
to
do
it
because
father
always
set
so
much
store
by
his
and
when
i
got
the
first
coat
on
lapham
called
it
cut
i
presume
i
must
have
set
as
much
as
half
an
hour
looking
at
it
and
thinking
how
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
i
had
my
share
of
luck
in
this
world
and
i
ai
to
complain
on
my
own
account
but
i
noticed
that
most
things
get
along
too
late
for
most
people
it
made
me
feel
bad
and
it
took
all
the
pride
out
my
success
with
the
paint
thinking
of
father
seemed
to
me
i
might
taken
more
interest
in
it
when
he
was
by
to
see
but
we
got
to
live
and
learn
well
i
called
my
wife
out
i
tried
it
on
the
back
of
the
house
you
know
and
she
left
her
dishes
i
can
remember
she
came
out
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
set
down
alongside
of
me
on
the
trestle
and
says
i
do
you
think
persis
and
says
she
you
hai
got
a
silas
lapham
you
got
a
she
always
was
just
so
enthusiastic
about
things
well
it
was
just
after
two
or
three
boats
had
burnt
up
out
west
and
a
lot
of
lives
lost
and
there
was
a
great
cry
about
paint
and
i
guess
that
was
what
was
in
her
mind
i
guess
it
ai
any
persis
says
i
i
guess
it
is
a
i
going
to
have
it
analysed
and
if
it
turns
out
what
i
think
it
is
i
going
to
work
it
and
if
father
had
had
such
a
long
name
i
should
call
it
the
nehemiah
lapham
mineral
paint
but
any
rate
every
barrel
of
it
and
every
keg
and
every
bottle
and
every
package
big
or
little
has
got
to
have
the
initials
and
figures
on
it
father
found
it
in
and
i
tried
it
in
x
business
said
bartley
yes
said
lapham
but
i
had
heard
of
plantation
bitters
then
and
i
had
seen
any
of
the
fellow
labels
i
set
to
work
and
i
got
a
man
down
from
boston
and
i
carried
him
out
to
the
farm
and
he
analysed
it
made
a
regular
job
of
it
well
sir
we
built
a
kiln
and
we
kept
a
lot
of
that
for
hours
kept
the
kanuck
and
his
family
up
firing
the
presence
of
iron
in
the
ore
showed
with
the
magnet
from
the
start
and
when
he
came
to
test
it
he
found
out
that
it
contained
about
per
cent
of
the
peroxide
of
iron
lapham
pronounced
the
scientific
phrases
with
a
sort
of
reverent
satisfaction
as
if
awed
through
his
pride
by
a
little
lingering
uncertainty
as
to
what
peroxide
was
he
accented
it
as
if
it
were
and
bartley
had
to
get
him
to
spell
it
well
and
what
then
he
asked
when
he
had
made
a
note
of
the
percentage
what
then
echoed
lapham
well
then
the
fellow
set
down
and
told
me
got
a
paint
here
says
he
going
to
drive
every
other
mineral
paint
out
of
the
market
why
says
he
drive
right
into
the
back
bay
of
course
i
did
know
what
the
back
bay
was
then
but
i
begun
to
open
my
eyes
thought
i
had
open
before
but
i
guess
i
had
says
he
paint
has
got
hydraulic
cement
in
it
and
it
can
stand
fire
and
water
and
acids
he
named
over
a
lot
of
things
says
he
mix
easily
with
linseed
oil
whether
you
want
to
use
it
boiled
or
raw
and
it
ai
to
crack
nor
fade
any
and
it
ai
to
scale
when
you
got
your
arrangements
for
burning
it
properly
you
going
to
have
a
paint
that
will
stand
like
the
everlasting
hills
in
every
climate
under
the
sun
then
he
went
into
a
lot
of
particulars
and
i
begun
to
think
he
was
drawing
a
and
meant
to
make
his
bill
accordingly
so
i
kept
pretty
cool
but
the
fellow
bill
did
amount
to
anything
hardly
said
i
might
pay
him
after
i
got
going
young
chap
and
pretty
easy
but
every
word
he
said
was
gospel
well
i
ai
to
brag
up
my
paint
i
do
suppose
you
came
here
to
hear
me
blow
oh
yes
i
did
said
bartley
that
what
i
want
tell
all
there
is
to
tell
and
i
can
boil
it
down
afterward
a
man
ca
make
a
greater
mistake
with
a
reporter
than
to
hold
back
anything
out
of
modesty
it
may
be
the
very
thing
we
want
to
know
what
we
want
is
the
whole
truth
and
more
we
got
so
much
modesty
of
our
own
that
we
can
temper
almost
any
statement
lapham
looked
as
if
he
did
not
quite
like
this
tone
and
he
resumed
a
little
more
quietly
oh
there
is
really
very
much
more
to
say
about
the
paint
itself
but
you
can
use
it
for
almost
anything
where
a
paint
is
wanted
inside
or
out
it
prevent
decay
and
it
stop
it
after
it
begun
in
tin
or
iron
you
can
paint
the
inside
of
a
cistern
or
a
with
it
and
water
wo
hurt
it
and
you
can
paint
a
with
it
and
heat
wo
you
can
cover
a
brick
wall
with
it
or
a
railroad
car
or
the
deck
of
a
steamboat
and
you
ca
do
a
better
thing
for
either
never
tried
it
on
the
human
conscience
i
suppose
suggested
bartley
no
sir
replied
lapham
gravely
i
guess
you
want
to
keep
that
as
free
from
paint
as
you
can
if
you
want
much
use
of
it
i
never
cared
to
try
any
of
it
on
mine
lapham
suddenly
lifted
his
bulk
up
out
of
his
and
led
the
way
out
into
the
wareroom
beyond
the
office
partitions
where
rows
and
ranks
of
casks
barrels
and
kegs
stretched
dimly
back
to
the
rear
of
the
building
and
diffused
an
honest
clean
wholesome
smell
of
oil
and
paint
they
were
labelled
and
branded
as
containing
each
so
many
pounds
of
lapham
mineral
paint
and
each
bore
the
mystic
devices
there
said
lapham
kicking
one
of
the
largest
casks
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
that
about
our
biggest
package
and
here
he
added
laying
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
head
of
a
very
small
keg
as
if
it
were
the
head
of
a
child
which
it
resembled
in
size
this
is
the
smallest
we
used
to
put
the
paint
on
the
market
dry
but
now
we
grind
every
ounce
of
it
in
oil
very
best
quality
of
linseed
oil
and
warrant
it
we
find
it
gives
more
satisfaction
now
come
back
to
the
office
and
i
show
you
our
fancy
brands
it
was
very
cool
and
pleasant
in
that
dim
wareroom
with
the
rafters
showing
overhead
in
a
cloudy
perspective
and
darkening
away
into
the
perpetual
twilight
at
the
rear
of
the
building
and
bartley
had
found
an
agreeable
seat
on
the
head
of
a
of
the
paint
which
he
was
reluctant
to
leave
but
he
rose
and
followed
the
vigorous
lead
of
lapham
back
to
the
office
where
the
sun
of
a
long
summer
afternoon
was
just
beginning
to
glare
in
at
the
window
on
shelves
opposite
desk
were
tin
cans
of
various
sizes
arranged
in
tapering
cylinders
and
showing
in
a
pattern
diminishing
toward
the
top
the
same
label
borne
by
the
casks
and
barrels
in
the
wareroom
lapham
merely
waved
his
hand
toward
these
but
when
bartley
after
a
comprehensive
glance
at
them
gave
his
whole
attention
to
a
row
of
clean
smooth
jars
where
different
tints
of
the
paint
showed
through
flawless
glass
lapham
smiled
and
waited
in
pleased
expectation
hello
said
bartley
that
pretty
yes
assented
lapham
it
is
rather
nice
it
our
latest
thing
and
we
find
it
takes
with
customers
look
here
he
said
taking
down
one
of
the
jars
and
pointing
to
the
first
line
of
the
label
bartley
read
the
persis
brand
and
then
he
looked
at
lapham
and
smiled
after
her
of
course
said
lapham
got
it
up
and
put
the
first
of
it
on
the
market
her
last
birthday
she
was
pleased
i
should
think
she
might
have
been
said
bartley
while
he
made
a
note
of
the
appearance
of
the
jars
i
do
know
about
your
mentioning
it
in
your
interview
said
lapham
dubiously
that
going
into
the
interview
lapham
if
nothing
else
does
got
a
wife
myself
and
i
know
just
how
you
feel
it
was
in
the
dawn
of
bartley
prosperity
on
the
boston
events
before
his
troubles
with
marcia
had
seriously
begun
is
that
so
said
lapham
recognising
with
a
smile
another
of
the
vast
majority
of
married
americans
a
few
underrate
their
wives
but
the
rest
think
them
supernal
in
intelligence
and
capability
well
he
added
we
must
see
about
that
where
you
say
you
lived
we
do
live
we
board
nash
canary
place
well
we
all
got
to
commence
that
way
suggested
lapham
consolingly
yes
but
we
about
got
to
the
end
of
our
string
i
expect
to
be
under
a
roof
of
my
own
on
clover
street
before
long
i
suppose
said
bartley
returning
to
business
that
you
did
let
the
grass
grow
under
your
feet
much
after
you
found
out
what
was
in
your
no
sir
answered
lapham
withdrawing
his
eyes
from
a
long
stare
at
bartley
in
which
he
had
been
seeing
himself
a
young
man
again
in
the
first
days
of
his
married
life
i
went
right
back
to
lumberville
and
sold
out
everything
and
put
all
i
could
rake
and
scrape
together
into
paint
and
mis
lapham
was
with
me
every
time
no
hang
back
about
her
i
tell
you
she
was
a
woman
bartley
laughed
that
the
sort
most
of
us
marry
no
we
do
said
lapham
most
of
us
marry
silly
little
girls
grown
up
to
look
like
women
well
i
guess
that
about
so
assented
bartley
as
if
upon
second
thought
if
it
had
been
for
her
resumed
lapham
the
paint
would
have
come
to
anything
i
used
to
tell
her
it
the
per
cent
of
of
iron
in
the
ore
that
made
that
paint
go
it
was
the
per
cent
of
of
iron
in
her
good
cried
bartley
i
tell
marcia
that
in
six
months
there
a
nor
a
nor
a
dead
wall
nor
a
barn
nor
a
face
of
rock
in
that
whole
region
that
did
have
mineral
paint
specimen
on
it
in
the
three
colours
we
begun
by
making
bartley
had
taken
his
seat
on
the
and
lapham
standing
before
him
now
put
up
his
huge
foot
close
to
bartley
thigh
neither
of
them
minded
that
i
heard
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
that
x
man
and
the
man
and
the
man
because
they
advertised
in
that
way
and
i
read
articles
about
it
in
the
papers
but
i
see
where
the
joke
comes
in
exactly
so
long
as
the
people
that
own
the
barns
and
fences
do
object
i
do
see
what
the
public
has
got
to
do
with
it
and
i
never
saw
anything
so
very
sacred
about
a
big
rock
along
a
river
or
in
a
pasture
that
it
would
do
to
put
mineral
paint
on
it
in
three
colours
i
wish
some
of
the
people
that
talk
about
the
landscape
and
write
about
it
had
to
one
of
them
rocks
out
of
the
landscape
with
powder
or
dig
a
hole
to
bury
it
in
as
we
used
to
have
to
do
up
on
the
farm
i
guess
they
sing
a
little
different
tune
about
the
profanation
of
scenery
there
ai
any
man
enjoys
a
sightly
bit
of
nature
a
smooth
piece
of
interval
with
half
a
dozen
elms
in
it
more
than
i
do
but
i
to
stand
up
for
every
big
ugly
rock
i
come
across
as
if
we
were
all
a
set
of
dumn
druids
i
say
the
landscape
was
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
landscape
yes
said
bartley
carelessly
it
was
made
for
the
man
and
the
man
it
was
made
for
any
man
that
knows
how
to
use
it
lapham
returned
insensible
to
bartley
irony
let
go
and
live
with
nature
in
the
winter
up
there
along
the
canada
line
and
i
guess
they
get
enough
of
her
for
one
while
well
where
was
i
decorating
the
landscape
said
bartley
yes
sir
i
started
right
there
at
lumberville
and
it
give
the
place
a
start
too
you
wo
find
it
on
the
map
now
and
you
wo
find
it
in
the
gazetteer
i
give
a
pretty
good
lump
of
money
to
build
a
about
five
years
back
and
the
first
meeting
they
held
in
it
they
voted
to
change
the
name
lumberville
a
name
and
lapham
now
is
it
somewhere
up
in
that
region
that
they
get
the
old
brandon
red
asked
bartley
we
about
ninety
miles
from
brandon
the
brandon
a
good
paint
said
lapham
conscientiously
like
to
show
you
round
up
at
our
place
some
odd
time
if
you
get
off
thanks
i
should
like
it
works
there
yes
works
there
well
sir
just
about
the
time
i
got
started
the
war
broke
out
and
it
knocked
my
paint
higher
than
a
kite
the
thing
dropped
perfectly
dead
i
presume
that
if
i
had
any
sort
of
influence
i
might
have
got
it
into
government
hands
for
and
army
wagons
and
may
be
on
board
government
vessels
but
i
had
and
we
had
to
face
the
music
i
was
about
but
she
looked
at
it
another
way
guess
it
a
providence
says
she
i
guess
you
got
a
country
that
worth
fighting
for
any
rate
you
better
go
out
and
give
it
a
chance
well
sir
i
went
i
knew
she
meant
business
it
might
kill
her
to
have
me
go
but
it
would
kill
her
sure
if
i
stayed
she
was
one
of
that
kind
i
went
her
last
words
was
look
after
the
paint
si
we
had
but
just
one
little
girl
then
boy
died
and
mis
lapham
mother
was
with
us
and
i
knew
if
times
did
anyways
come
up
again
know
just
what
to
do
so
i
went
i
got
through
and
you
can
call
me
colonel
if
you
want
to
feel
there
lapham
took
bartley
thumb
and
forefinger
and
put
them
on
a
bunch
in
his
leg
just
above
the
knee
anything
hard
ball
lapham
nodded
gettysburg
that
my
thermometer
if
it
for
that
i
should
know
enough
to
come
in
when
it
rains
bartley
laughed
at
a
joke
which
betrayed
some
evidences
of
wear
and
when
you
came
back
you
took
hold
of
the
paint
and
rushed
it
i
took
hold
of
the
paint
and
rushed
it
all
i
could
said
lapham
with
less
satisfaction
than
he
had
hitherto
shown
in
his
autobiography
but
i
found
that
i
had
got
back
to
another
world
the
day
of
small
things
was
past
and
i
do
suppose
it
will
ever
come
again
in
this
country
my
wife
was
at
me
all
the
time
to
take
a
partner
somebody
with
capital
but
i
could
seem
to
bear
the
idea
that
paint
was
like
my
own
blood
to
me
to
have
anybody
else
concerned
in
it
was
like
well
i
do
know
what
i
saw
it
was
the
thing
to
do
but
i
tried
to
fight
it
off
and
i
tried
to
joke
it
off
i
used
to
say
did
you
take
a
partner
yourself
persis
while
i
was
away
and
she
say
if
you
had
come
back
i
should
si
always
did
like
a
joke
about
as
well
as
any
woman
i
ever
saw
well
i
had
to
come
to
it
i
took
a
partner
lapham
dropped
the
bold
blue
eyes
with
which
he
had
been
till
now
staring
into
bartley
face
and
the
reporter
knew
that
here
was
a
place
for
asterisks
in
his
interview
if
interviews
were
faithful
he
had
money
enough
continued
lapham
with
a
suppressed
sigh
but
he
did
know
anything
about
paint
we
hung
on
together
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
we
quit
and
he
had
the
experience
suggested
bartley
with
companionable
ease
i
had
some
of
the
experience
too
said
lapham
with
a
scowl
and
bartley
divined
through
the
freemasonry
of
all
who
have
sore
places
in
their
memories
that
this
was
a
point
which
he
must
not
touch
again
and
since
that
i
suppose
you
played
it
alone
i
played
it
alone
you
must
ship
some
of
this
paint
of
yours

foreign
countries
colonel

a
professional
air

cape
of
good
hope
it
stand
any
climate
of
course
we
do
export
these
fancy
brands
much
they
for
home
use
but
we
introducing
them
elsewhere
here
lapham
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
showed
bartley
a
lot
of
labels
in
different
languages
spanish
french
german
and
italian
we
expect

do
a
good
business
in
all
those
countries
we
got
our
agencies
in
cadiz
now
and
in
paris
and
in
hamburg
and
in
leghorn
it
a
thing
bound
to
make
its
way
yes
sir
wherever
a
man
has
got
a
ship
or
a
bridge
or
a
lock
or
a
house
or
a
car
or
a
fence
or
a
anywhere
in
god
universe
to
paint
that
the
paint
for
him
and
bound
to
find
it
out
sooner
or
later
you
pass
a
ton
of
that
paint
dry
through
a
and
you
get
a
quarter
of
a
ton
of
i
believe
in
my
paint
i
believe
it
a
blessing
to
the
world
when
folks
come
in
and
kind
of
smell
round
and
ask
me
what
i
mix
it
with
i
always
say
in
the
first
place
i
mix
it
with
faith
and
after
that
i
grind
it
up
with
the
best
quality
of
boiled
linseed
oil
that
money
will
buy
lapham
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
and
bartley
perceived
that
his
audience
was
drawing
to
a
close
you
ever
want
to
run
down
and
take
a
look
at
our
works
pass
you
over
the
road
he
called
it
rud
and
it
cost
you
a
cent
well
may
be
i
shall
sometime
said
bartley
good
afternoon
colonel
good
afternoon
or
hold
on
my
horse
down
there
yet
william
he
called
to
the
young
man
in
the
who
had
taken
his
letter
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
oh
all
right
he
added
in
response
to
something
the
young
man
said
ca
i
set
you
down
somewhere
hubbard
i
got
my
horse
at
the
door
and
i
can
drop
you
on
my
way
home
i
going
to
take
mis
lapham
to
look
at
a
house
i
driving
piles
for
down
on
the
new
land
do
care
if
i
do
said
bartley
lapham
put
on
a
straw
hat
gathered
up
some
papers
lying
on
his
desk
pulled
down
its
rolling
cover
turned
the
key
in
it
and
gave
the
papers
to
an
extremely
handsome
young
woman
at
one
of
the
desks
in
the
outer
office
she
was
stylishly
dressed
as
bartley
saw
and
her
smooth
yellow
hair
was
sculpturesquely
waved
over
a
low
white
forehead
here
said
lapham
with
the
same
prompt
gruff
kindness
that
he
had
used
in
addressing
the
young
man
i
want
you
should
put
these
in
shape
and
give
me
a
copy
what
an
uncommonly
pretty
girl
said
bartley
as
they
descended
the
rough
stairway
and
found
their
way
out
to
the
street
past
the
dangling
rope
of
a
block
and
tackle
wandering
up
into
the
cavernous
darkness
overhead
she
does
her
work
said
lapham
shortly
bartley
mounted
to
the
left
side
of
the
open
buggy
standing
at
the
and
lapham
gathering
up
the
slid
it
under
the
and
mounted
beside
him
no
chance
to
speed
a
horse
here
of
course
said
lapham
while
the
horse
with
a
spirited
gentleness
picked
her
way
with
a
high
long
action
over
the
pavement
of
the
street
the
streets
were
all
narrow
and
most
of
them
crooked
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
but
at
the
end
of
one
the
spars
of
a
vessel
pencilled
themselves
delicately
against
the
cool
blue
of
the
afternoon
sky
the
air
was
full
of
a
smell
pleasantly
compounded
of
oakum
of
leather
and
of
oil
it
was
not
the
busy
season
and
they
met
only
two
or
three
trucks
heavily
straggling
toward
the
wharf
with
their
long
string
teams
but
the
of
the
pavement
were
worn
with
the
dint
of
ponderous
wheels
and
discoloured
with
from
them
here
and
there
in
wandering
streaks
over
its
surface
was
the
grey
stain
of
the
salt
water
with
which
the
street
had
been
sprinkled
after
an
interval
of
some
minutes
which
both
men
spent
in
looking
round
the
from
opposite
sides
to
watch
the
stride
of
the
horse
bartley
said
with
a
light
sigh
i
had
a
colt
once
down
in
maine
that
stepped
just
like
that
mare
well
said
lapham
sympathetically
recognising
the
bond
that
this
fact
created
between
them
well
now
i
tell
you
what
you
do
you
let
me
come
for
you
any
afternoon
now
and
take
you
out
over
the
milldam
and
speed
this
mare
a
little
i
like
to
show
you
what
this
mare
can
do
yes
i
would
all
right
answered
bartley
i
let
you
know
my
first
day
off
good
cried
lapham
kentucky
queried
bartley
no
sir
i
do
ride
behind
anything
but
vermont
never
did
touch
of
morgan
of
course
but
you
ca
have
much
morgan
in
a
horse
if
you
want
speed
hambletonian
mostly
where
you
say
you
wanted
to
get
out
i
guess
you
may
put
me
down
at
the
events
office
just
round
the
corner
here
i
got
to
write
up
this
interview
while
it
fresh
all
right
said
lapham
impersonally
assenting
to
bartley
use
of
him
as
material
he
had
not
much
to
complain
of
in
bartley
treatment
unless
it
was
the
strain
of
extravagant
compliment
which
it
involved
but
the
flattery
was
mainly
for
the
paint
whose
virtues
lapham
did
not
believe
could
be
overstated
and
himself
and
his
history
had
been
treated
with
as
much
respect
as
bartley
was
capable
of
showing
any
one
he
made
a
very
picturesque
thing
of
the
discovery
of
the
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
virgin
forests
of
vermont
far
up
toward
the
line
of
the
canadian
snows
on
a
desolate
where
an
autumnal
storm
had
done
its
wild
work
and
the
great
trees
strewn
hither
and
thither
bore
witness
to
its
violence
nehemiah
lapham
discovered
just
forty
years
ago
the
mineral
which
the
alchemy
of
his
son
enterprise
and
energy
has
transmuted
into
solid
ingots
of
the
most
precious
of
metals
the
colossal
fortune
of
colonel
silas
lapham
lay
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
which
an
uprooted
tree
had
dug
for
him
and
which
for
many
years
remained
a
of
no
more
appreciable
value
than
a
here
bartley
had
not
been
able
to
forego
another
grin
but
he
compensated
for
it
by
the
high
reverence
with
which
he
spoke
of
colonel
lapham
record
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
and
of
the
motives
which
impelled
him
to
turn
aside
from
an
enterprise
in
which
his
whole
heart
was
engaged
and
take
part
in
the
struggle
the
colonel
bears
embedded
in
the
muscle
of
his
right
leg
a
little
memento
of
the
period
in
the
shape
of
a
which
he
jocularly
referred
to
as
his
thermometer
and
which
relieves
him
from
the
necessity
of
reading
probabilities
in
his
morning
paper
this
saves
him
just
so
much
time
and
for
a
man
who
as
he
said
has
not
a
moment
of
waste
time
on
him
anywhere
five
minutes
a
day
are
something
in
the
course
of
a
year
simple
clear
bold
and
straightforward
in
mind
and
action
colonel
silas
lapham
with
a
prompt
comprehensiveness
and
a
business
sagacity
is
in
the
best
sense
of
that
term
one
of
nature
noblemen
to
the
last
inch
of
his
five
eleven
and
a
half
his
life
affords
an
example
of
application
and
unwavering
perseverance
which
our
young
business
men
would
do
well
to
emulate
there
is
nothing
showy
or
meretricious
about
the
man
he
believes
in
mineral
paint
and
he
puts
his
heart
and
soul
into
it
he
makes
it
a
religion
though
we
would
not
imply
that
it
is
his
religion
colonel
lapham
is
a
regular
attendant
at
the
rev
langworthy
church
he
subscribes
liberally
to
the
associated
charities
and
no
good
object
or
worthy
public
enterprise
fails
to
receive
his
support
he
is
not
now
actively
in
politics
and
his
paint
is
not
partisan
but
it
is
an
open
secret
that
he
is
and
always
has
been
a
staunch
republican
without
violating
the
sanctities
of
private
life
we
can
not
speak
fully
of
various
details
which
came
out
in
the
free
and
unembarrassed
interview
which
colonel
lapham
accorded
our
representative
but
we
may
say
that
the
success
of
which
he
is
justly
proud
he
is
also
proud
to
attribute
in
great
measure
to
the
sympathy
and
energy
of
his
wife
one
of
those
women
who
in
whatever
walk
of
life
seem
born
to
honour
the
name
of
american
woman
and
to
redeem
it
from
the
national
reproach
of
daisy
millerism
of
colonel
lapham
family
we
will
simply
add
that
it
consists
of
two
young
lady
daughters
the
subject
of
this
very
inadequate
sketch
is
building
a
house
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
street
after
designs
by
one
of
our
leading
architectural
firms
which
when
complete
will
be
one
of
the
finest
ornaments
of
that
exclusive
avenue
it
will
we
believe
be
ready
for
the
occupancy
of
the
family
sometime
in
the
spring
when
bartley
had
finished
his
article
which
he
did
with
a
good
deal
of
inward
derision
he
went
home
to
marcia
still
smiling
over
the
thought
of
lapham
whose
burly
simplicity
had
peculiarly
amused
him
he
regularly
turned
himself
inside
out
to
me
he
said
as
he
sat
describing
his
interview
to
marcia
then
i
know
you
could
make
something
nice
out
of
it
said
his
wife
and
that
will
please
mr
witherby
oh
yes
i
done
pretty
well
but
i
could
let
myself
loose
on
him
the
way
i
wanted
to
confound
the
limitations
of
decency
anyway
i
should
like
to
have
told
just
what
colonel
lapham
thought
of
landscape
advertising
in
colonel
lapham
own
words
i
tell
you
one
thing
marsh
he
had
a
girl
there
at
one
of
the
desks
that
you
would
let
me
have
within
gunshot
of
my
office
pretty
it
ai
any
name
for
it
marcia
eyes
began
to
blaze
and
bartley
broke
out
into
a
laugh
in
which
he
arrested
himself
at
sight
of
a
formidable
parcel
in
the
corner
of
the
room
hello
what
that
why
i
do
know
what
it
is
replied
marcia
tremulously
a
man
brought
it
just
before
you
came
in
and
i
did
like
to
open
it
think
it
was
some
kind
of
infernal
machine
asked
bartley
getting
down
on
his
knees
to
examine
the
package
hubbard
heigh
he
cut
the
heavy
hemp
string
with
his
penknife
we
must
look
into
this
thing
i
should
like
to
know
who
sending
packages
to
hubbard
in
my
absence
he
unfolded
the
wrappings
of
paper
growing
softer
and
finer
inward
and
presently
pulled
out
a
handsome
square
glass
jar
through
which
a
crimson
mass
showed
richly
the
persis
brand
he
yelled
i
knew
it
oh
what
is
it
bartley
quavered
marcia
then
courageously
drawing
a
little
nearer
is
it
some
kind
of
jam
she
implored
jam
no
roared
bartley
it
paint
it
mineral
paint
lapham
paint
paint
echoed
marcia
as
she
stood
over
him
while
he
stripped
their
wrappings
from
the
jars
which
showed
the
dark
blue
dark
green
light
brown
dark
brown
and
black
with
the
dark
crimson
forming
the
gamut
of
colour
of
the
lapham
paint
do
tell
me
it
paint
that
i
can
use
bartley
well
i
should
advise
you
to
use
much
of
it
all
at
once
replied
her
husband
but
it
paint
that
you
can
use
in
moderation
marcia
cast
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
o
bartley
i
think
i
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
i
was
just
wondering
what
i
should
do
there
are
places
in
that
clover
street
house
that
need
touching
up
so
dreadfully
i
shall
be
very
careful
you
need
be
afraid
i
shall
overdo
but
this
just
saves
my
life
did
you
buy
it
bartley
you
know
we
could
afford
it
and
you
ought
to
have
done
it
and
what
does
the
persis
brand
mean
buy
it
cried
bartley
no
the
old
fool
sent
it
to
you
as
a
present
you
better
wait
for
the
facts
before
you
pitch
into
me
for
extravagance
marcia
persis
is
the
name
of
his
wife
and
he
named
it
after
her
because
it
his
finest
brand
you
see
it
in
my
interview
put
it
on
the
market
her
last
birthday
for
a
surprise
to
her
what
old
fool
faltered
marcia
why
lapham
the
mineral
paint
man
oh
what
a
good
man
sighed
marcia
from
the
bottom
of
her
soul
bartley
you
wo
make
fun
of
him
as
you
do
of
some
of
those
people
will
you
nothing
that
he
ever
find
out
said
bartley
getting
up
and
brushing
off
the
from
his
knees
ii
after
dropping
bartley
hubbard
at
the
events
building
lapham
drove
on
down
washington
street
to
nankeen
square
at
the
south
end
where
he
had
lived
ever
since
the
mistaken
movement
of
society
in
that
direction
ceased
he
had
not
built
but
had
bought
very
cheap
of
a
terrified
gentleman
of
good
extraction
who
discovered
too
late
that
the
south
end
was
not
the
thing
and
who
in
the
eagerness
of
his
flight
to
the
back
bay
threw
in
his
carpets
and
shades
for
almost
nothing
lapham
was
even
better
satisfied
with
their
bargain
than
the
colonel
himself
and
they
had
lived
in
nankeen
square
for
twelve
years
they
had
seen
the
saplings
planted
in
the
pretty
oval
round
which
the
houses
were
built
flourish
up
into
sturdy
young
trees
and
their
two
little
girls
in
the
same
period
had
grown
into
young
ladies
the
colonel
tough
frame
had
expanded
into
the
bulk
which
bartley
interview
indicated
and
lapham
while
keeping
a
more
youthful
outline
showed
the
sharp
print
of
the
at
the
corners
of
her
motherly
eyes
and
certain
slight
creases
in
her
wholesome
cheeks
the
fact
that
they
lived
in
an
unfashionable
neighbourhood
was
something
that
they
had
never
been
made
to
feel
to
their
personal
disadvantage
and
they
had
hardly
known
it
till
the
summer
before
this
story
opens
when
lapham
and
her
daughter
irene
had
met
some
other
bostonians
far
from
boston
who
made
it
memorable
they
were
people
whom
chance
had
brought
for
the
time
under
a
singular
obligation
to
the
lapham
ladies
and
they
were
gratefully
recognisant
of
it
they
had
ventured
a
mother
and
two
daughters
as
far
as
a
rather
wild
little
canadian
on
the
lawrence
below
quebec
and
had
arrived
some
days
before
their
son
and
brother
was
expected
to
join
them
two
of
their
trunks
had
gone
astray
and
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
the
mother
was
taken
violently
lapham
came
to
their
help
with
her
skill
as
nurse
and
with
the
abundance
of
her
own
and
her
daughter
wardrobe
and
a
profuse
kindness
when
a
doctor
could
be
got
at
he
said
that
but
for
lapham
timely
care
the
lady
would
hardly
have
lived
he
was
a
very
effusive
little
frenchman
and
fancied
he
was
saying
something
very
pleasant
to
everybody
a
certain
intimacy
inevitably
followed
and
when
the
son
came
he
was
even
more
grateful
than
the
others
lapham
could
not
quite
understand
why
he
should
be
as
attentive
to
her
as
to
irene
but
she
compared
him
with
other
young
men
about
the
place
and
thought
him
nicer
than
any
of
them
she
had
not
the
means
of
a
wider
comparison
for
in
boston
with
all
her
husband
prosperity
they
had
not
had
a
social
life
their
first
years
there
were
given
to
careful
getting
on
lapham
part
and
careful
saving
on
his
wife
suddenly
the
money
began
to
come
so
abundantly
that
she
need
not
save
and
then
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
a
certain
amount
could
be
spent
on
horses
and
lapham
spent
it
his
wife
spent
on
rich
and
rather
ugly
clothes
and
a
luxury
of
household
appointments
lapham
had
not
yet
reached
the
stage
of
the
rich
man
development
but
they
decorated
their
house
with
the
costliest
and
most
abominable
frescoes
they
went
upon
journeys
and
lavished
upon
cars
and
hotels
they
gave
with
both
hands
to
their
church
and
to
all
the
charities
it
brought
them
acquainted
with
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
spend
on
society
up
to
a
certain
period
lapham
had
the
ladies
of
her
neighbourhood
in
to
tea
as
her
mother
had
done
in
the
country
in
her
younger
days
lapham
idea
of
hospitality
was
still
to
bring
a
customer
home
to
neither
of
them
imagined
dinners
their
two
girls
had
gone
to
the
public
schools
where
they
had
not
got
on
as
fast
as
some
of
the
other
girls
so
that
they
were
a
year
behind
in
graduating
from
the
where
lapham
thought
that
they
had
got
education
enough
his
wife
was
of
a
different
mind
she
would
have
liked
them
to
go
to
some
private
school
for
their
finishing
but
irene
did
not
care
for
study
she
preferred
and
both
the
sisters
were
afraid
of
being
snubbed
by
the
other
girls
who
were
of
a
different
sort
from
the
girls
of
the
these
were
mostly
from
the
parks
and
squares
like
themselves
it
ended
in
their
going
part
of
a
year
but
the
elder
had
an
odd
taste
of
her
own
for
reading
and
she
took
some
private
lessons
and
read
books
out
of
the
circulating
library
the
whole
family
were
amazed
at
the
number
she
read
and
rather
proud
of
it
they
were
not
girls
who
embroidered
or
abandoned
themselves
to
irene
spent
her
abundant
leisure
in
shopping
for
herself
and
her
mother
of
whom
both
daughters
made
a
kind
of
idol
buying
her
caps
and
laces
out
of
their
and
getting
her
dresses
far
beyond
her
capacity
to
wear
irene
dressed
herself
very
stylishly
and
spent
hours
on
her
toilet
every
day
her
sister
had
a
simpler
taste
and
if
she
had
done
altogether
as
she
liked
might
even
have
slighted
dress
they
all
three
took
long
naps
every
day
and
sat
hours
together
minutely
discussing
what
they
saw
out
of
the
window
in
her
search
for
the
elder
sister
went
to
many
church
lectures
on
a
vast
variety
of
secular
subjects
and
usually
came
home
with
a
comic
account
of
them
and
that
made
more
matter
of
talk
for
the
whole
family
she
could
make
fun
of
nearly
everything
irene
complained
that
she
scared
away
the
young
men
whom
they
got
acquainted
with
at
the
sociables
they
were
perhaps
not
the
wisest
young
men
the
girls
had
learned
to
dance
at
papanti
but
they
had
not
belonged
to
the
private
classes
they
did
not
even
know
of
them
and
a
great
gulf
divided
them
from
those
who
did
their
father
did
not
like
company
except
such
as
came
informally
in
their
way
and
their
mother
had
remained
too
rustic
to
know
how
to
attract
it
in
the
sophisticated
city
fashion
none
of
them
had
grasped
the
idea
of
european
travel
but
they
had
gone
about
to
mountain
and
resorts
the
mother
and
the
two
girls
where
they
witnessed
the
spectacle
which
such
resorts
present
throughout
new
england
of
multitudes
of
girls
lovely
accomplished
exquisitely
dressed
humbly
glad
of
the
presence
of
any
sort
of
young
man
but
the
laphams
had
no
skill
or
courage
to
make
themselves
noticed
far
less
courted
by
the
solitary
invalid
or
clergyman
or
artist
they
lurked
helplessly
about
in
the
hotel
parlours
looking
on
and
not
knowing
how
to
put
themselves
forward
perhaps
they
did
not
care
a
great
deal
to
do
so
they
had
not
a
conceit
of
themselves
but
a
sort
of
content
in
their
own
ways
that
one
may
notice
in
certain
families
the
very
strength
of
their
mutual
affection
was
a
barrier
to
worldly
knowledge
they
dressed
for
one
another
they
equipped
their
house
for
their
own
satisfaction
they
lived
richly
to
themselves
not
because
they
were
selfish
but
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
do
otherwise
the
elder
daughter
did
not
care
for
society
apparently
the
younger
who
was
but
three
years
younger
was
not
yet
quite
old
enough
to
be
ambitious
of
it
with
all
her
wonderful
beauty
she
had
an
innocence
almost
vegetable
when
her
beauty
which
in
its
immaturity
was
crude
and
harsh
suddenly
ripened
she
bloomed
and
glowed
with
the
unconsciousness
of
a
flower
she
not
merely
did
not
feel
herself
admired
but
hardly
knew
herself
discovered
if
she
dressed
well
perhaps
too
well
it
was
because
she
had
the
instinct
of
dress
but
till
she
met
this
young
man
who
was
so
nice
to
her
at
baie
paul
she
had
scarcely
lived
a
detached
individual
life
so
wholly
had
she
depended
on
her
mother
and
her
sister
for
her
opinions
almost
her
sensations
she
took
account
of
everything
he
did
and
said
pondering
it
and
trying
to
make
out
exactly
what
he
meant
to
the
inflection
of
a
syllable
the
slightest
movement
or
gesture
in
this
way
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
form
ideas
which
she
had
not
derived
from
her
family
and
they
were
none
the
less
her
own
because
they
were
often
mistaken
some
of
the
things
that
he
partly
said
partly
looked
she
reported
to
her
mother
and
they
talked
them
over
as
they
did
everything
relating
to
these
new
acquaintances
and
wrought
them
into
the
novel
point
of
view
which
they
were
acquiring
when
lapham
returned
home
she
submitted
all
the
accumulated
facts
of
the
case
and
all
her
own
conjectures
to
her
husband
and
canvassed
them
anew
at
first
he
was
disposed
to
regard
the
whole
affair
as
of
small
importance
and
she
had
to
insist
a
little
beyond
her
own
convictions
in
order
to
counteract
his
indifference
well
i
can
tell
you
she
said
that
if
you
think
they
were
not
the
nicest
people
you
ever
saw
you
mightily
mistaken
they
had
about
the
best
manners
and
they
had
been
everywhere
and
knew
everything
i
declare
it
made
me
feel
as
if
we
had
always
lived
in
the
backwoods
i
do
know
but
the
mother
and
the
daughters
would
have
let
you
feel
so
a
little
if
they
showed
out
all
they
thought
but
they
never
did
and
the
son
well
i
ca
express
it
silas
but
that
young
man
had
about
perfect
ways
seem
struck
up
on
irene
asked
the
colonel
how
can
i
tell
he
seemed
just
about
as
much
struck
up
on
me
anyway
he
paid
me
as
much
attention
as
he
did
her
perhaps
it
more
the
way
now
to
notice
the
mother
than
it
used
to
be
lapham
ventured
no
conjecture
but
asked
as
he
had
asked
already
who
the
people
were
lapham
repeated
their
name
lapham
nodded
his
head
do
you
know
them
what
business
is
he
in
i
guess
he
ai
in
anything
said
lapham
they
were
very
nice
said
lapham
impartially
well
they
ought
to
be
returned
the
colonel
never
done
anything
else
they
did
seem
stuck
up
urged
his
wife
they
no
need
to
with
you
i
could
buy
him
and
sell
him
twice
over
this
answer
satisfied
lapham
rather
with
the
fact
than
with
her
husband
well
i
guess
i
would
brag
silas
she
said
in
the
winter
the
ladies
of
this
family
who
returned
to
town
very
late
came
to
call
on
lapham
they
were
again
very
polite
but
the
mother
let
drop
in
apology
for
their
calling
almost
at
nightfall
that
the
coachman
had
not
known
the
way
exactly
nearly
all
our
friends
are
on
the
new
land
or
on
the
hill
there
was
a
barb
in
this
that
rankled
after
the
ladies
had
gone
and
on
comparing
notes
with
her
daughter
lapham
found
that
a
barb
had
been
left
to
rankle
in
her
mind
also
they
said
they
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
town
before
upon
a
strict
search
of
her
memory
irene
could
not
report
that
the
fact
had
been
stated
with
anything
like
insinuation
but
it
was
that
which
gave
it
a
more
penetrating
effect
oh
well
of
course
said
lapham
to
whom
these
facts
were
referred
those
sort
of
people
have
got
much
business
up
our
way
and
they
do
come
it
a
fair
thing
all
round
we
do
trouble
the
hill
or
the
new
land
much
we
know
where
they
are
suggested
his
wife
thoughtfully
yes
assented
the
colonel
i
know
where
they
are
i
got
a
lot
of
land
over
on
the
back
bay
you
have
eagerly
demanded
his
wife
want
me
to
build
on
it
he
asked
in
reply
with
a
quizzical
smile
i
guess
we
can
get
along
here
for
a
while
this
was
at
night
in
the
morning
lapham
said
i
suppose
we
ought
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
the
children
in
every
way
i
supposed
we
always
had
replied
her
husband
yes
we
have
according
to
our
light
have
you
got
some
new
light
i
do
know
as
it
light
but
if
the
girls
are
going
to
keep
on
living
in
boston
and
marry
here
i
presume
we
ought
to
try
to
get
them
into
society
some
way
or
ought
to
do
something
well
who
ever
done
more
for
their
children
than
we
have
demanded
lapham
with
a
pang
at
the
thought
that
he
could
possibly
have
been
do
they
have
everything
they
want
do
they
dress
just
as
you
say
do
you
go
everywhere
with
is
there
ever
anything
going
on
that
worth
while
that
they
do
see
it
or
hear
it
i
know
what
you
mean
why
do
you
get
them
into
society
there
money
enough
there
got
to
be
something
besides
money
i
guess
said
lapham
with
a
hopeless
sigh
i
presume
we
did
go
to
work
just
the
right
way
about
their
schooling
we
ought
to
have
got
them
into
some
school
where
they
have
got
acquainted
with
city
girls
girls
who
could
help
them
along
nearly
everybody
at
miss
smillie
was
from
some
where
else
well
it
pretty
late
to
think
about
that
now
grumbled
lapham
and
we
always
gone
our
own
way
and
not
looked
out
for
the
future
we
ought
to
have
gone
out
more
and
had
people
come
to
the
house
nobody
comes
well
is
that
my
fault
i
guess
nobody
ever
makes
people
welcomer
we
ought
to
have
invited
company
more
why
do
you
do
it
now
if
it
for
the
girls
i
do
care
if
you
have
the
house
full
all
the
while
lapham
was
forced
to
a
confession
full
of
humiliation
i
know
who
to
ask
well
you
ca
expect
me
to
tell
you
no
we
both
country
people
and
we
kept
our
country
ways
and
we
do
either
of
us
know
what
to
do
you
had
to
work
so
hard
and
your
luck
was
so
long
coming
and
then
it
came
with
such
a
rush
that
we
have
had
any
chance
to
learn
what
to
do
with
it
it
just
the
same
with
irene
looks
i
did
expect
she
was
ever
going
to
have
any
she
was
such
a
plain
child
and
all
at
once
she
blazed
out
this
way
as
long
as
it
was
pen
that
did
seem
to
care
for
society
i
did
give
much
mind
to
it
but
i
can
see
it
going
to
be
different
with
irene
i
do
believe
but
what
we
in
the
wrong
neighbourhood
well
said
the
colonel
there
ai
a
prettier
lot
on
the
back
bay
than
mine
it
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
and
it
feet
wide
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
deep
let
build
on
it
lapham
was
silent
a
while
no
she
said
finally
we
always
got
along
well
enough
here
and
i
guess
we
better
stay
at
breakfast
she
said
casually
girls
how
would
you
like
to
have
your
father
build
on
the
new
land
the
girls
said
they
did
not
know
it
was
more
convenient
to
the
where
they
were
lapham
stole
a
look
of
relief
at
her
husband
and
nothing
more
was
said
of
the
matter
the
mother
of
the
family
who
had
called
upon
lapham
brought
her
husband
cards
and
when
lapham
returned
the
visit
she
was
in
some
trouble
about
the
proper
form
of
acknowledging
the
civility
the
colonel
had
no
card
but
a
business
card
which
advertised
the
principal
depot
and
the
several
agencies
of
the
mineral
paint
and
lapham
doubted
till
she
wished
to
goodness
that
she
had
never
seen
nor
heard
of
those
people
whether
to
ignore
her
husband
in
the
transaction
altogether
or
to
write
his
name
on
her
own
card
she
decided
finally
upon
this
measure
and
she
had
the
relief
of
not
finding
the
family
at
home
as
far
as
she
could
judge
irene
seemed
to
suffer
a
little
disappointment
from
the
fact
for
several
months
there
was
no
communication
between
the
families
then
there
came
to
nankeen
square
a
lithographed
circular
from
the
people
on
the
hill
signed
in
ink
by
the
mother
and
affording
lapham
an
opportunity
to
subscribe
for
a
charity
of
undeniable
merit
and
acceptability
she
submitted
it
to
her
husband
who
promptly
drew
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
dollars
she
tore
it
in
two
i
will
take
a
cheque
for
a
hundred
silas
she
said
why
he
asked
looking
up
guiltily
at
her
because
a
hundred
is
enough
and
i
do
want
to
show
off
before
them
oh
i
thought
may
be
you
did
well
pert
he
added
having
satisfied
human
nature
by
the
preliminary
thrust
i
guess
you
about
right
when
do
you
want
i
should
begin
to
build
on
beacon
street
he
handed
her
the
new
cheque
where
she
stood
over
him
and
then
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
up
at
her
i
do
want
you
should
begin
at
all
what
do
you
mean
silas
she
rested
against
the
side
of
his
desk
well
i
do
know
as
i
mean
anything
but
should
you
like
to
build
everybody
builds
at
least
once
in
a
lifetime
where
is
your
lot
they
say
it
unhealthy
over
there
up
to
a
certain
point
in
their
prosperity
lapham
had
kept
strict
account
of
all
her
husband
affairs
but
as
they
expanded
and
ceased
to
be
of
the
retail
nature
with
which
women
successfully
grapple
the
intimate
knowledge
of
them
made
her
nervous
there
was
a
period
in
which
she
felt
that
they
were
being
ruined
but
the
crash
had
not
come
and
since
his
great
success
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
a
blind
confidence
in
her
husband
judgment
which
she
had
hitherto
felt
needed
her
revision
he
came
and
went
day
by
day
unquestioned
he
bought
and
sold
and
got
gain
she
knew
that
he
would
tell
her
if
ever
things
went
wrong
and
he
knew
that
she
would
ask
him
whenever
she
was
anxious
it
ai
unhealthy
where
i
bought
said
lapham
rather
enjoying
her
insinuation
i
looked
after
that
when
i
was
trading
and
i
guess
it
about
as
healthy
on
the
back
bay
as
it
is
here
anyway
i
got
that
lot
for
you
pert
i
thought
you
want
to
build
on
the
back
bay
some
day
pshaw
said
lapham
deeply
pleased
inwardly
but
not
going
to
show
it
as
she
would
have
said
i
guess
you
want
to
build
there
yourself
she
insensibly
got
a
little
nearer
to
her
husband
they
liked
to
talk
to
each
other
in
that
blunt
way
it
is
the
new
england
way
of
expressing
perfect
confidence
and
tenderness
well
i
guess
i
do
said
lapham
not
insisting
upon
the
unselfish
view
of
the
matter
i
always
did
like
the
water
side
of
beacon
there
ai
a
sightlier
place
in
the
world
for
a
house
and
some
day
there
bound
to
be
a
all
along
behind
them
houses
between
them
and
the
water
and
then
a
lot
there
is
going
to
be
worth
the
gold
that
will
cover
it
coin
i
had
offers
for
that
lot
pert
twice
over
what
i
give
for
it
yes
i
have
do
you
want
to
ride
over
there
some
afternoon
with
me
and
see
it
i
satisfied
where
we
be
si
said
lapham
recurring
to
the
parlance
of
her
youth
in
her
pathos
at
her
husband
kindness
she
sighed
anxiously
for
she
felt
the
trouble
a
woman
knows
in
view
of
any
great
change
they
had
often
talked
of
altering
over
the
house
in
which
they
lived
but
they
had
never
come
to
it
and
they
had
often
talked
of
building
but
it
had
always
been
a
house
in
the
country
that
they
had
thought
of
i
wish
you
had
sold
that
lot
i
hai
said
the
colonel
briefly
i
do
know
as
i
feel
much
like
changing
our
way
of
living
guess
we
could
live
there
pretty
much
as
we
live
here
there
all
kinds
of
people
on
beacon
street
you
must
think
they
all
i
know
one
party
that
lives
in
a
house
he
built
to
sell
and
his
wife
do
keep
any
girl
you
can
have
just
as
much
style
there
as
you
want
or
just
as
little
i
guess
we
live
as
well
as
most
of
now
and
set
as
good
a
table
and
if
you
come
to
style
i
do
know
as
anybody
has
got
more
of
a
right
to
put
it
on
than
what
we
have
well
i
do
want
to
build
on
beacon
street
si
said
lapham
gently
just
as
you
please
persis
i
ai
in
any
hurry
to
leave
lapham
stood
flapping
the
cheque
which
she
held
in
her
right
hand
against
the
edge
of
her
left
the
colonel
still
sat
looking
up
at
her
face
and
watching
the
effect
of
the
poison
of
ambition
which
he
had
artfully
instilled
into
her
mind
she
sighed
again
a
yielding
sigh
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
i
going
to
take
a
turn
on
the
brighton
road
said
the
colonel
i
do
believe
but
what
i
should
like
to
go
along
said
his
wife
all
right
you
hai
ever
rode
behind
that
mare
yet
pert
and
i
want
you
should
see
me
let
her
out
once
they
say
the
snow
all
packed
down
already
and
the
going
is
a
at
four
in
the
afternoon
with
a
cold
red
winter
sunset
before
them
the
colonel
and
his
wife
were
driving
slowly
down
beacon
street
in
the
light
cutter
where
as
he
said
they
were
a
pretty
tight
fit
he
was
holding
the
mare
in
till
the
time
came
to
speed
her
and
the
mare
was
springily
jolting
over
the
snow
looking
intelligently
from
side
to
side
and
cocking
this
ear
and
that
while
from
her
nostrils
her
head
tossing
easily
she
blew
quick
irregular
whiffs
of
steam
gay
ai
she
proudly
suggested
the
colonel
she
is
gay
assented
his
wife
they
met
swiftly
dashing
sleighs
and
let
them
pass
on
either
hand
down
the
beautiful
avenue
narrowing
with
an
admirably
even
in
the
perspective
they
were
not
in
a
hurry
the
mare
jounced
easily
along
and
they
talked
of
the
different
houses
on
either
side
of
the
way
they
had
a
crude
taste
in
architecture
and
they
admired
the
worst
there
were
women
faces
at
many
of
the
handsome
windows
and
once
in
a
while
a
young
man
on
the
pavement
caught
his
hat
suddenly
from
his
head
and
bowed
in
response
to
some
salutation
from
within
i
do
think
our
girls
would
look
very
bad
behind
one
of
those
big
panes
said
the
colonel
no
said
his
wife
dreamily
where
the
young
man
did
he
come
with
them
no
he
was
to
spend
the
winter
with
a
friend
of
his
that
has
a
ranch
in
texas
i
guess
he
got
to
do
something
yes
gentlemaning
as
a
profession
has
got
to
play
out
in
a
generation
or
two
neither
of
them
spoke
of
the
lot
though
lapham
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
wife
had
come
with
him
for
and
she
was
aware
that
he
knew
it
the
time
came
when
he
brought
the
mare
down
to
a
walk
and
then
slowed
up
almost
to
a
stop
while
they
both
turned
their
heads
to
the
right
and
looked
at
the
vacant
lot
through
which
showed
the
frozen
stretch
of
the
back
bay
a
section
of
the
long
bridge
and
the
roofs
and
of
charlestown
yes
it
sightly
said
lapham
lifting
her
hand
from
the
reins
on
which
she
had
unconsciously
laid
it
lapham
said
nothing
but
he
let
the
mare
out
a
little
the
sleighs
and
cutters
were
thickening
round
them
on
the
milldam
it
became
difficult
to
restrict
the
mare
to
the
long
slow
trot
into
which
he
let
her
break
the
beautiful
landscape
widened
to
right
and
left
of
them
with
the
sunset
redder
and
redder
over
the
low
irregular
hills
before
them
they
crossed
the
milldam
into
longwood
and
here
from
the
crest
of
the
first
upland
stretched
two
endless
lines
in
which
thousands
of
cutters
went
and
came
some
of
the
drivers
were
already
speeding
their
horses
and
these
shot
to
and
fro
on
inner
lines
between
the
slowly
moving
vehicles
on
either
side
of
the
road
here
and
there
a
burly
mounted
policeman
bulging
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
jolted
by
silently
gesturing
and
directing
the
course
and
keeping
it
all
under
the
eye
of
the
law
it
was
what
bartley
hubbard
called
a
carnival
of
fashion
and
gaiety
on
the
brighton
road
in
his
account
of
it
but
most
of
the
people
in
those
elegant
sleighs
and
cutters
had
so
little
the
air
of
the
great
world
that
one
knowing
it
at
all
must
have
wondered
where
they
and
their
money
came
from
and
the
gaiety
of
the
men
at
least
was
expressed
like
that
of
colonel
lapham
in
a
grim
almost
fierce
alertness
the
women
wore
an
air
of
courageous
apprehension
at
a
certain
point
the
colonel
said
i
going
to
let
her
out
pert
and
he
lifted
and
then
dropped
the
reins
lightly
on
the
mare
back
she
understood
the
signal
and
as
an
admirer
said
she
laid
down
to
her
work
nothing
in
the
immutable
iron
of
lapham
face
betrayed
his
sense
of
triumph
as
the
mare
left
everything
behind
her
on
the
road
lapham
if
she
felt
fear
was
too
busy
holding
her
flying
wraps
about
her
and
shielding
her
face
from
the
scud
of
ice
flung
from
the
mare
heels
to
betray
it
except
for
the
rush
of
her
feet
the
mare
was
as
silent
as
the
people
behind
her
the
muscles
of
her
back
and
thighs
worked
more
and
more
swiftly
like
some
mechanism
responding
to
an
alien
force
and
she
shot
to
the
end
of
the
course
grazing
a
hundred
encountered
and
rival
sledges
in
her
passage
but
unmolested
by
the
policemen
who
probably
saw
that
the
mare
and
the
colonel
knew
what
they
were
about
and
at
any
rate
were
not
the
sort
of
men
to
interfere
with
trotting
like
that
at
the
end
of
the
heat
lapham
drew
her
in
and
turned
off
on
a
side
street
into
brookline
tell
you
what
pert
he
said
as
if
they
had
been
quietly
jogging
along
with
time
for
uninterrupted
thought
since
he
last
spoke
about
made
up
my
mind
to
build
on
that
lot
all
right
silas
said
lapham
i
suppose
you
know
what
about
do
build
on
it
for
me
that
all
when
she
stood
in
the
hall
at
home
taking
off
her
things
she
said
to
the
girls
who
were
helping
her
some
day
your
father
will
get
killed
with
that
mare
did
he
speed
her
asked
penelope
the
elder
she
was
named
after
her
grandmother
who
had
in
her
turn
inherited
from
another
ancestress
the
name
of
the
homeric
matron
whose
peculiar
merits
won
her
a
place
even
among
the
puritan
faiths
hopes
temperances
and
prudences
penelope
was
the
girl
whose
odd
serious
face
had
struck
bartley
hubbard
in
the
photograph
of
the
family
group
lapham
showed
him
on
the
day
of
the
interview
her
large
eyes
like
her
hair
were
brown
they
had
the
peculiar
look
of
eyes
which
is
called
mooning
her
complexion
was
of
a
dark
pallor
her
mother
did
not
reply
to
a
question
which
might
be
considered
already
answered
he
says
he
going
to
build
on
that
lot
of
his
she
next
remarked
unwinding
the
long
veil
which
she
had
tied
round
her
neck
to
hold
her
bonnet
on
she
put
her
hat
and
cloak
on
the
hall
table
to
be
carried
upstairs
later
and
they
all
went
in
to
tea
creamed
oysters
birds
hot
biscuit
two
kinds
of
cake
and
dishes
of
stewed
and
canned
fruit
and
honey
the
women
dined
alone
at
one
and
the
colonel
at
the
same
hour
but
he
liked
a
good
hot
meal
when
he
got
home
in
the
evening
the
house
flared
with
gas
and
the
colonel
before
he
sat
down
went
about
shutting
the
registers
through
which
a
welding
heat
came
voluming
up
from
the
furnace
i
be
the
death
of
that
darkey
yet
he
said
if
he
do
stop
making
on
such
a
fire
the
only
way
to
get
any
comfort
out
of
your
furnace
is
to
take
care
of
it
yourself
well
answered
his
wife
from
behind
the
teapot
as
he
sat
down
at
table
with
this
threat
there
nothing
to
prevent
you
si
and
you
can
shovel
the
snow
too
if
you
want
to
till
you
get
over
to
beacon
street
anyway
i
guess
i
can
keep
my
own
sidewalk
on
beacon
street
clean
if
i
take
the
notion
i
should
like
to
see
you
at
it
retorted
his
wife
well
you
keep
a
sharp
lookout
and
may
be
you
will
their
taunts
were
really
expressions
of
affectionate
pride
in
each
other
they
liked
to
have
it
give
and
take
that
way
as
they
would
have
said
right
along
a
man
can
be
a
man
on
beacon
street
as
well
as
anywhere
i
guess
well
i
do
the
wash
as
i
used
to
in
lumberville
said
lapham
i
presume
you
let
me
have
set
tubs
si
you
know
i
so
young
any
more
she
passed
irene
a
cup
of
oolong
tea
none
of
them
had
a
sufficiently
cultivated
palate
for
and
the
girl
handed
it
to
her
father
papa
she
asked
you
do
really
mean
that
you
going
to
build
over
there
do
i
you
wait
and
see
said
the
colonel
stirring
his
tea
i
do
believe
you
do
pursued
the
girl
is
that
so
i
presume
you
hate
to
have
me
your
mother
does
he
said
doos
of
course
penelope
took
the
word
i
go
in
for
it
i
do
see
any
use
in
not
enjoying
money
if
you
got
it
to
enjoy
that
what
it
for
i
suppose
though
you
might
always
think
so
she
had
a
slow
quaint
way
of
talking
that
seemed
a
pleasant
personal
modification
of
some
ancestral
yankee
drawl
and
her
voice
was
low
and
cozy
and
so
far
from
being
nasal
that
it
was
a
little
hoarse
i
guess
the
ayes
has
it
pen
said
her
father
how
would
it
do
to
let
irene
and
your
mother
stick
in
the
old
place
here
and
us
go
into
the
new
house
at
times
the
colonel
grammar
failed
him
the
matter
dropped
and
the
laphams
lived
on
as
before
with
joking
recurrences
to
the
house
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
the
colonel
seemed
less
in
earnest
than
any
of
them
about
it
but
that
was
his
way
his
girls
said
you
never
could
tell
when
he
really
meant
a
thing
iii
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
there
came
a
newspaper
addressed
to
miss
irene
lapham
it
proved
to
be
a
texas
newspaper
with
a
complimentary
account
of
the
ranch
of
the
hon
loring
stanton
which
the
representative
of
the
journal
had
visited
it
must
be
his
friend
said
lapham
to
whom
her
daughter
brought
the
paper
the
one
he
staying
with
the
girl
did
not
say
anything
but
she
carried
the
paper
to
her
room
where
she
scanned
every
line
of
it
for
another
name
she
did
not
find
it
but
she
cut
the
notice
out
and
stuck
it
into
the
side
of
her
mirror
where
she
could
read
it
every
morning
when
she
brushed
her
hair
and
the
last
thing
at
night
when
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
just
before
turning
off
the
gas
her
sister
often
read
it
aloud
standing
behind
her
and
rendering
it
with
elocutionary
effects
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
of
a
in
the
form
of
a
puff
to
a
but
perhaps
that
the
style
on
the
hill
lapham
told
her
husband
of
the
arrival
of
the
paper
treating
the
fact
with
an
importance
that
he
refused
to
see
in
it
how
do
you
know
the
fellow
sent
it
anyway
he
demanded
oh
i
know
he
did
i
do
see
why
he
could
write
to
if
he
really
meant
anything
well
i
guess
that
would
be
their
way
said
lapham
she
did
not
at
all
know
what
their
way
would
be
when
the
spring
opened
colonel
lapham
showed
that
he
had
been
in
earnest
about
building
on
the
new
land
his
idea
of
a
house
was
a
front
four
stories
high
and
a
french
roof
with
an
above
inside
there
was
to
be
a
on
the
street
and
a
back
the
parlours
were
to
be
on
the
second
floor
and
finished
in
black
walnut
or
paint
the
chambers
were
to
be
on
the
three
floors
above
front
and
rear
with
over
the
front
door
black
walnut
was
to
be
used
everywhere
except
in
the
attic
which
was
to
be
painted
and
grained
to
look
like
black
walnut
the
whole
was
to
be
very
and
there
were
to
be
handsome
cornices
and
elaborate
throughout
except
again
in
the
attic
these
ideas
he
had
formed
from
the
inspection
of
many
new
buildings
which
he
had
seen
going
up
and
which
he
had
a
passion
for
looking
into
he
was
confirmed
in
his
ideas
by
a
master
builder
who
had
put
up
a
great
many
houses
on
the
back
bay
as
a
speculation
and
who
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
to
have
a
house
in
the
style
that
was
the
way
to
have
it
the
beginnings
of
the
process
by
which
lapham
escaped
from
the
master
builder
and
ended
in
the
hands
of
an
architect
are
so
obscure
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
trace
them
but
it
all
happened
and
lapham
promptly
developed
his
ideas
of
black
walnut
finish
high
studding
and
cornices
the
architect
was
able
to
conceal
the
shudder
which
they
must
have
sent
through
him
he
was
skilful
as
nearly
all
architects
are
in
playing
upon
that
simple
instrument
man
he
began
to
touch
colonel
lapham
stops
oh
certainly
have
the
parlours
but
you
seen
some
of
those
pretty
have
you
where
the
is
very
yes
lapham
assented
well
do
you
think
something
of
that
kind
would
have
a
very
nice
effect
have
the
and
your
parlours
on
the
next
floor
as
high
as
you
please
put
your
little
here
beside
the
door
and
get
the
whole
width
of
your
house
frontage
for
a
square
hall
and
an
easy
staircase
running
up
three
sides
of
it
i
sure
lapham
would
find
it
much
pleasanter
the
architect
caught
toward
him
a
scrap
of
paper
lying
on
the
table
at
which
they
were
sitting
and
sketched
his
idea
then
have
your
behind
the
hall
looking
on
the
water
he
glanced
at
lapham
who
said
of
course
and
the
architect
went
on
that
gets
you
rid
of
one
of
those
long
straight
ugly
staircases
until
that
moment
lapham
had
thought
a
long
straight
staircase
the
chief
ornament
of
a
house
and
gives
you
an
effect
of
amplitude
and
space
that
so
said
lapham
her
husband
merely
made
a
noise
in
his
throat
then
were
you
thinking
of
having
your
parlours
together
connected
by
folding
doors
asked
the
architect
deferentially
yes
of
course
said
lapham
they
always
so
ai
they
well
nearly
said
the
architect
i
was
wondering
how
would
it
do
to
make
one
large
square
room
at
the
front
taking
the
whole
breadth
of
the
house
and
with
this
between
have
a
back
for
the
young
ladies
lapham
looked
helplessly
at
his
wife
whose
quicker
apprehension
had
followed
the
architect
pencil
with
instant
sympathy
she
cried
the
colonel
gave
way
i
guess
that
would
do
it
be
kind
of
odd
wo
it
well
i
do
know
said
the
architect
not
so
odd
i
hope
as
the
other
thing
will
be
a
few
years
from
now
he
went
on
to
plan
the
rest
of
the
house
and
he
showed
himself
such
a
master
in
regard
to
all
the
practical
details
that
lapham
began
to
feel
a
motherly
affection
for
the
young
man
and
her
husband
could
not
deny
in
his
heart
that
the
fellow
seemed
to
understand
his
business
he
stopped
walking
about
the
room
as
he
had
begun
to
do
when
the
architect
and
lapham
entered
into
the
particulars
of
closets
drainage
kitchen
arrangements
and
all
that
and
came
back
to
the
table
i
presume
he
said
have
the
finished
in
black
walnut
well
yes
replied
the
architect
if
you
like
but
some
less
expensive
wood
can
be
made
just
as
effective
with
paint
of
course
you
can
paint
black
walnut
too
paint
it
gasped
the
colonel
yes
said
the
architect
quietly
white
or
a
little
off
white
lapham
dropped
the
plan
he
had
picked
up
from
the
table
his
wife
made
a
little
move
toward
him
of
consolation
or
support
of
course
resumed
the
architect
i
know
there
has
been
a
great
craze
for
black
walnut
but
it
an
ugly
wood
and
for
a
there
is
really
nothing
like
white
paint
we
should
want
to
introduce
a
little
gold
here
and
there
perhaps
we
might
run
a
painted
frieze
round
under
the
cornice
garlands
of
roses
on
a
gold
ground
it
would
tell
wonderfully
in
a
white
room
the
colonel
returned
less
courageously
to
the
charge
i
presume
you
want
eastlake
and
tiles
he
meant
this
for
a
sarcastic
thrust
at
a
prevailing
foible
of
the
profession
well
no
gently
answered
the
architect
i
was
thinking
perhaps
a
white
marble
treated
in
the
refined
empire
style
would
be
the
thing
for
that
room
white
marble
exclaimed
the
colonel
i
thought
that
had
gone
out
long
ago
really
beautiful
things
ca
go
out
they
may
disappear
for
a
little
while
but
they
must
come
back
it
only
the
ugly
things
that
stay
out
after
they
had
their
day
lapham
could
only
venture
very
modestly
floors
in
the
of
course
consented
the
architect
and
in
the
carpet
some
sort
of
moquette
i
should
say
but
i
should
prefer
to
consult
lapham
taste
in
that
matter
and
in
the
other
rooms
oh
carpets
of
course
and
what
about
the
stairs
carpet
and
i
should
have
the
rail
and
banisters
white
banisters
turned
or
twisted
the
colonel
said
under
his
breath
well
i
dumned
but
he
gave
no
utterance
to
his
astonishment
in
the
architect
presence
when
he
went
at
last
the
session
did
not
end
till
eleven
lapham
said
well
pert
i
guess
that
fellow
fifty
years
behind
or
ten
years
ahead
i
wonder
what
the
ongpeer
style
is
i
do
know
i
hated
to
ask
but
he
seemed
to
understand
what
he
was
talking
about
i
declare
he
knows
what
a
woman
wants
in
a
house
better
than
she
does
herself
and
a
man
simply
nowhere
in
comparison
said
lapham
but
he
respected
a
fellow
who
could
beat
him
at
every
point
and
have
a
reason
ready
as
this
architect
had
and
when
he
recovered
from
the
daze
into
which
the
complete
upheaval
of
all
his
preconceived
notions
had
left
him
he
was
in
a
fit
state
to
swear
by
the
architect
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
discovered
the
fellow
as
he
always
called
him
and
owned
him
now
and
the
fellow
did
nothing
to
disturb
this
impression
he
entered
into
that
brief
but
intense
intimacy
with
the
laphams
which
the
sympathetic
architect
holds
with
his
clients
he
was
privy
to
all
their
differences
of
opinion
and
all
their
disputes
about
the
house
he
knew
just
where
to
insist
upon
his
own
ideas
and
where
to
yield
he
was
really
building
several
other
houses
but
he
gave
the
laphams
the
impression
that
he
was
doing
none
but
theirs
the
work
was
not
begun
till
the
frost
was
thoroughly
out
of
the
ground
which
that
year
was
not
before
the
end
of
april
even
then
it
did
not
proceed
very
rapidly
lapham
said
they
might
as
well
take
their
time
to
it
if
they
got
the
walls
up
and
the
thing
closed
in
before
the
snow
flew
they
could
be
working
at
it
all
winter
it
was
found
necessary
to
dig
for
the
kitchen
at
that
point
the
original
lay
near
the
surface
and
before
they
began
to
put
in
the
piles
for
the
foundation
they
had
to
pump
the
neighbourhood
smelt
like
the
hold
of
a
ship
after
a
three
years
voyage
people
who
had
cast
their
fortunes
with
the
new
land
went
by
professing
not
to
notice
it
people
who
still
hung
on
to
the
hill
put
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
noses
and
told
each
other
the
old
terrible
stories
of
the
material
used
in
filling
up
the
back
bay
nothing
gave
lapham
so
much
satisfaction
in
the
whole
construction
of
his
house
as
the
when
this
began
early
in
the
summer
he
took
lapham
every
day
in
his
buggy
and
drove
round
to
look
at
it
stopping
the
mare
in
front
of
the
lot
and
watching
the
operation
with
even
keener
interest
than
the
little
loafing
irish
boys
who
superintended
it
in
force
it
pleased
him
to
hear
the
portable
engine
chuckle
out
a
hundred
thin
whiffs
of
steam
in
carrying
the
big
iron
weight
to
the
top
of
the
framework
above
the
pile
then
seem
to
hesitate
and
cough
once
or
twice
in
pressing
the
weight
against
the
detaching
apparatus
there
was
a
moment
in
which
the
weight
had
the
effect
of
poising
before
it
fell
then
it
dropped
with
a
mighty
whack
on
the
head
of
the
pile
and
drove
it
a
foot
into
the
earth
by
gracious
he
would
say
there
ai
anything
like
that
in
this
world
for
business
persis
lapham
suffered
him
to
enjoy
the
sight
twenty
or
thirty
times
before
she
said
well
now
drive
on
si
by
the
time
the
foundation
was
in
and
the
brick
walls
had
begun
to
go
up
there
were
so
few
people
left
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
might
indulge
with
impunity
her
husband
passion
for
having
her
clamber
over
the
and
the
skeleton
with
him
many
of
the
householders
had
boarded
up
their
front
doors
before
the
buds
had
begun
to
swell
and
the
assessor
to
appear
in
early
may
others
had
followed
soon
and
lapham
was
as
safe
from
remark
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
depth
of
the
country
ordinarily
she
and
her
girls
left
town
early
in
july
going
to
one
of
the
hotels
at
nantasket
where
it
was
convenient
for
the
colonel
to
get
to
and
from
his
business
by
the
boat
but
this
summer
they
were
all
lingering
a
few
weeks
later
under
the
novel
fascination
of
the
new
house
as
they
called
it
as
if
there
were
no
other
in
the
world
lapham
drove
there
with
his
wife
after
he
had
set
bartley
hubbard
down
at
the
events
office
but
on
this
day
something
happened
that
interfered
with
the
solid
pleasure
they
usually
took
in
going
over
the
house
as
the
colonel
turned
from
casting
anchor
at
the
mare
head
with
the
after
helping
his
wife
to
alight
he
encountered
a
man
to
whom
he
could
not
help
speaking
though
the
man
seemed
to
share
his
hesitation
if
not
his
reluctance
at
the
necessity
he
was
a
tallish
thin
man
with
a
face
and
a
dead
clerical
air
which
somehow
suggested
at
once
feebleness
and
tenacity
lapham
held
out
her
hand
to
him
why
mr
rogers
she
exclaimed
and
then
turning
toward
her
husband
seemed
to
refer
the
two
men
to
each
other
they
shook
hands
but
lapham
did
not
speak
i
did
know
you
were
in
boston
pursued
lapham
is
rogers
with
you
no
said
rogers
with
a
voice
which
had
the
flat
succinct
sound
of
two
pieces
of
wood
clapped
together
rogers
is
still
in
chicago
a
little
silence
followed
and
then
mrs
lapham
said
i
presume
you
are
quite
settled
out
there
no
we
have
left
chicago
rogers
has
merely
remained
to
finish
up
a
little
packing
oh
indeed
are
you
coming
back
to
boston
i
can
not
say
as
yet
we
sometimes
think
of
so
doing
lapham
turned
away
and
looked
up
at
the
building
his
wife
pulled
a
little
at
her
glove
as
if
embarrassed
or
even
pained
she
tried
to
make
a
diversion
we
are
building
a
house
she
said
with
a
meaningless
laugh
oh
indeed
said
rogers
looking
up
at
it
then
no
one
spoke
again
and
she
said
helplessly
if
you
come
to
boston
i
hope
i
shall
see
mrs
rogers
she
will
be
happy
to
have
you
call
said
mr
rogers
he
touched
his
and
made
a
bow
forward
rather
than
in
lapham
direction
she
mounted
the
planking
that
led
into
the
shelter
of
the
bare
brick
walls
and
her
husband
slowly
followed
when
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
her
cheeks
were
burning
and
tears
that
looked
hot
stood
in
her
eyes
you
left
it
all
to
me
she
cried
why
could
you
speak
a
word
i
had
anything
to
say
to
him
replied
lapham
sullenly
they
stood
a
while
without
looking
at
the
work
which
they
had
come
to
enjoy
and
without
speaking
to
each
other
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
go
on
said
lapham
at
last
as
they
returned
to
the
buggy
the
colonel
drove
recklessly
toward
the
milldam
his
wife
kept
her
veil
down
and
her
face
turned
from
him
after
a
time
she
put
her
handkerchief
up
under
her
veil
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
he
set
his
teeth
and
squared
his
jaw
i
do
see
how
he
always
manages
to
appear
just
at
the
moment
when
he
seems
to
have
gone
fairly
out
of
our
lives
and
blight
everything
she
whimpered
i
supposed
he
was
dead
said
lapham
oh
do
say
such
a
thing
it
sounds
as
if
you
wished
it
why
do
you
mind
it
what
do
you
let
him
blight
everything
for
i
ca
help
it
and
i
do
believe
i
ever
shall
i
do
know
as
his
being
dead
would
help
it
any
i
ca
ever
see
him
without
feeling
just
as
i
did
at
first
i
tell
you
said
lapham
it
was
a
perfectly
square
thing
and
i
wish
once
for
all
you
would
quit
bothering
about
it
my
conscience
is
easy
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
and
it
always
was
and
i
ca
look
at
him
without
feeling
as
if
you
ruined
him
silas
do
look
at
him
then
said
her
husband
with
a
scowl
i
want
you
should
recollect
in
the
first
place
persis
that
i
never
wanted
a
partner
if
he
had
put
his
money
in
when
he
did
you
broken
down
well
he
got
his
money
out
again
and
more
too
said
the
colonel
with
a
sulky
weariness
he
did
want
to
take
it
out
i
gave
him
his
choice
buy
out
or
go
out
you
know
he
could
buy
out
then
it
was
no
choice
at
all
it
was
a
business
chance
no
you
had
better
face
the
truth
silas
it
was
no
chance
at
all
you
crowded
him
out
a
man
that
had
saved
you
no
you
had
got
greedy
silas
you
had
made
your
paint
your
god
and
you
could
bear
to
let
anybody
else
share
in
its
blessings
i
tell
you
he
was
a
drag
and
a
brake
on
me
from
the
word
go
you
say
he
saved
me
well
if
i
had
got
him
out
he
ruined
me
sooner
or
later
so
it
an
even
thing
as
far
forth
as
that
goes
no
it
ai
an
even
thing
and
you
know
it
silas
oh
if
i
could
only
get
you
once
to
acknowledge
that
you
did
wrong
about
it
then
i
should
have
some
hope
i
do
say
you
meant
wrong
exactly
but
you
took
an
advantage
yes
you
took
an
advantage
you
had
him
where
he
could
help
himself
and
then
you
would
show
him
any
mercy
i
sick
of
this
said
lapham
if
you
to
the
house
manage
my
business
without
your
help
you
were
very
glad
of
my
help
once
well
i
tired
of
it
now
do
meddle
i
will
meddle
when
i
see
you
hardening
yourself
in
a
wrong
thing
it
time
for
me
to
meddle
as
you
call
it
and
i
will
i
ca
ever
get
you
to
own
up
the
least
bit
about
rogers
and
i
feel
as
if
it
was
hurting
you
all
the
while
what
do
you
want
i
should
own
up
about
a
thing
for
when
i
do
feel
wrong
i
tell
you
rogers
hai
got
anything
to
complain
of
and
what
i
told
you
from
the
start
it
a
thing
that
done
every
day
i
was
loaded
up
with
a
partner
that
did
know
anything
and
could
do
anything
and
i
unloaded
that
all
you
unloaded
just
at
the
time
when
you
knew
that
your
paint
was
going
to
be
worth
about
twice
what
it
ever
had
been
and
you
wanted
all
the
advantage
for
yourself
i
had
a
right
to
it
i
made
the
success
yes
you
made
it
with
rogers
money
and
when
you
made
it
you
took
his
share
of
it
i
guess
you
thought
of
that
when
you
saw
him
and
that
why
you
could
look
him
in
the
face
at
these
words
lapham
lost
his
temper
i
guess
you
do
want
to
ride
with
me
any
more
he
said
turning
the
mare
abruptly
round
i
as
ready
to
go
back
as
what
you
are
replied
his
wife
and
do
you
ask
me
to
go
to
that
house
with
you
any
more
you
can
sell
it
for
all
me
i
live
in
it
there
blood
on
it
iv
the
silken
texture
of
the
marriage
tie
bears
a
daily
strain
of
wrong
and
insult
to
which
no
other
human
relation
can
be
subjected
without
lesion
and
sometimes
the
strength
that
knits
society
together
might
appear
to
the
eye
of
faltering
faith
the
curse
of
those
immediately
bound
by
it
two
people
by
no
means
reckless
of
each
other
rights
and
feelings
but
even
tender
of
them
for
the
most
part
may
tear
at
each
other
in
this
sacred
bond
with
perfect
impunity
though
if
they
were
any
other
two
they
would
not
speak
or
look
at
each
other
again
after
the
outrages
they
exchange
it
is
certainly
a
curious
spectacle
and
doubtless
it
ought
to
convince
an
observer
of
the
divinity
of
the
institution
if
the
husband
and
wife
are
blunt
outspoken
people
like
the
laphams
they
do
not
weigh
their
words
if
they
are
more
refined
they
weigh
them
very
carefully
and
know
accurately
just
how
far
they
will
carry
and
in
what
most
sensitive
spot
they
may
be
planted
with
most
effect
lapham
was
proud
of
his
wife
and
when
he
married
her
it
had
been
a
rise
in
life
for
him
for
a
while
he
stood
in
awe
of
his
good
fortune
but
this
could
not
last
and
he
simply
remained
supremely
satisfied
with
it
the
girl
who
had
taught
school
with
a
clear
head
and
a
strong
hand
was
not
afraid
of
work
she
encouraged
and
helped
him
from
the
first
and
bore
her
full
share
of
the
common
burden
she
had
health
and
she
did
not
worry
his
life
out
with
peevish
complaints
and
vagaries
she
had
sense
and
principle
and
in
their
simple
lot
she
did
what
was
wise
and
right
their
marriage
was
hallowed
by
an
early
sorrow
they
lost
their
boy
and
it
was
years
before
they
could
look
each
other
in
the
face
and
speak
of
him
no
one
gave
up
more
than
they
when
they
gave
up
each
other
and
lapham
went
to
the
war
when
he
came
back
and
began
to
work
her
zeal
and
courage
formed
the
spring
of
his
enterprise
in
that
affair
of
the
partnership
she
had
tried
to
be
his
conscience
but
perhaps
she
would
have
defended
him
if
he
had
accused
himself
it
was
one
of
those
things
in
this
life
which
seem
destined
to
await
justice
or
at
least
judgment
in
the
next
as
he
said
lapham
had
dealt
fairly
by
his
partner
in
money
he
had
let
rogers
take
more
money
out
of
the
business
than
he
put
into
it
he
had
as
he
said
simply
forced
out
of
it
a
timid
and
inefficient
participant
in
advantages
which
he
had
created
but
lapham
had
not
created
them
all
he
had
been
dependent
at
one
time
on
his
partner
capital
it
was
a
moment
of
terrible
trial
happy
is
the
man
for
ever
after
who
can
choose
the
ideal
the
unselfish
part
in
such
an
exigency
lapham
could
not
rise
to
it
he
did
what
he
could
maintain
to
be
perfectly
fair
the
wrong
if
any
seemed
to
be
condoned
to
him
except
when
from
time
to
time
his
wife
brought
it
up
then
all
the
question
stung
and
burned
anew
and
had
to
be
reasoned
out
and
put
away
once
more
it
seemed
to
have
an
inextinguishable
vitality
it
slept
but
it
did
not
die
his
course
did
not
shake
lapham
faith
in
him
it
astonished
her
at
first
and
it
always
grieved
her
that
he
could
not
see
that
he
was
acting
solely
in
his
own
interest
but
she
found
excuses
for
him
which
at
times
she
made
reproaches
she
vaguely
perceived
that
his
paint
was
something
more
than
business
to
him
it
was
a
sentiment
almost
a
passion
he
could
not
share
its
management
and
its
profit
with
another
without
a
measure
of
far
beyond
that
which
he
must
make
with
something
less
personal
to
him
it
was
the
poetry
of
that
nature
otherwise
so
intensely
prosaic
and
she
understood
this
and
for
the
most
part
forbore
she
knew
him
good
and
true
and
blameless
in
all
his
life
except
for
this
wrong
if
it
were
a
wrong
and
it
was
only
when
her
nerves
tingled
intolerably
with
some
chance
renewal
of
the
pain
she
had
suffered
that
she
shared
her
anguish
with
him
in
true
wifely
fashion
with
those
two
there
was
never
anything
like
an
explicit
reconciliation
they
simply
ignored
a
quarrel
and
lapham
had
only
to
say
a
few
days
after
at
breakfast
i
guess
the
girls
would
like
to
go
round
with
you
this
afternoon
and
look
at
the
new
house
in
order
to
make
her
husband
grumble
out
as
he
looked
down
into
his
i
guess
we
better
all
go
had
we
well
i
see
she
said
there
was
not
really
a
great
deal
to
look
at
when
lapham
arrived
on
the
ground
in
his
but
the
walls
were
up
and
the
studding
had
already
given
skeleton
shape
to
the
interior
the
floors
were
roughly
boarded
over
and
the
stairways
were
in
place
with
provisional
treads
rudely
laid
they
had
not
begun
to
lath
and
plaster
yet
but
the
clean
fresh
smell
of
the
mortar
in
the
walls
mingling
with
the
pungent
fragrance
of
the
pine
shavings
neutralised
the
venetian
odour
that
drew
in
over
the
water
it
was
pleasantly
shady
there
though
for
the
matter
of
that
the
heat
of
the
morning
had
all
been
washed
out
of
the
atmosphere
by
a
tide
of
east
wind
setting
in
at
noon
and
the
thrilling
delicious
cool
of
a
boston
summer
afternoon
bathed
every
nerve
the
foreman
went
about
with
lapham
showing
her
where
the
doors
were
to
be
but
lapham
soon
tired
of
this
and
having
found
a
pine
stick
of
perfect
grain
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
pleasure
of
whittling
it
in
what
was
to
be
the
where
he
sat
looking
out
on
the
street
from
what
was
to
be
the
here
he
was
presently
joined
by
his
girls
who
after
locating
their
own
room
on
the
water
side
above
the
had
no
more
wish
to
enter
into
details
than
their
father
come
and
take
a
seat
in
the
ladies
he
called
out
to
them
as
they
looked
in
at
him
through
the
ribs
of
the
wall
he
jocosely
made
room
for
them
on
the
trestle
on
which
he
sat
they
came
gingerly
and
vaguely
forward
as
young
ladies
do
when
they
wish
not
to
seem
to
be
going
to
do
a
thing
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
do
when
they
had
taken
their
places
on
their
trestle
they
could
not
help
laughing
with
scorn
open
and
acceptable
to
their
father
and
irene
curled
her
chin
up
in
a
little
way
she
had
and
said
how
ridiculous
to
her
sister
well
i
can
tell
you
what
said
the
colonel
in
fond
enjoyment
of
their
young
ladyishness
your
mother
ashamed
to
sit
with
me
on
a
trestle
when
i
called
her
out
to
look
at
the
first
coat
of
my
paint
that
i
ever
tried
on
a
house
yes
we
heard
that
story
said
penelope
with
easy
security
of
her
father
liking
what
she
said
we
were
brought
up
on
that
story
well
it
a
good
story
said
her
father
at
that
moment
a
young
man
came
suddenly
in
range
who
began
to
look
up
at
the
signs
of
building
as
he
approached
he
dropped
his
eyes
in
coming
abreast
of
the
where
lapham
sat
with
his
girls
and
then
his
face
lightened
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
irene
she
rose
mechanically
from
the
trestle
and
her
face
lightened
too
she
was
a
very
pretty
figure
of
a
girl
after
our
fashion
of
girls
round
and
slim
and
flexible
and
her
face
was
admirably
regular
but
her
great
beauty
and
it
was
very
great
was
in
her
colouring
this
was
of
an
effect
for
which
there
is
no
word
but
delicious
as
we
use
it
of
fruit
or
flowers
she
had
red
hair
like
her
father
in
his
earlier
days
and
the
tints
of
her
cheeks
and
temples
were
such
as
suggested
and
and
peaches
instead
of
the
grey
that
often
dulls
this
complexion
her
eyes
were
of
a
blue
at
once
intense
and
tender
and
they
seemed
to
burn
on
what
they
looked
at
with
a
soft
lambent
flame
it
was
well
understood
by
her
sister
and
mother
that
her
eyes
always
expressed
a
great
deal
more
than
irene
ever
thought
or
felt
but
this
is
not
saying
that
she
was
not
a
very
sensible
girl
and
very
honest
the
young
man
faltered
perceptibly
and
irene
came
a
little
forward
and
then
there
gushed
from
them
both
a
smiling
exchange
of
greeting
of
which
the
sum
was
that
he
supposed
she
was
out
of
town
and
that
she
had
not
known
that
he
had
got
back
a
pause
ensued
and
flushing
again
in
her
uncertainty
as
to
whether
she
ought
or
ought
not
to
do
it
she
said
my
father
corey
and
my
sister
the
young
man
took
off
his
hat
again
showing
his
shapely
head
with
a
line
of
wholesome
sunburn
ceasing
where
the
recently
and
closely
clipped
hair
began
he
was
dressed
in
a
fine
summer
check
with
a
blue
neckerchief
and
he
had
a
white
hat
in
which
he
looked
very
well
when
he
put
it
back
on
his
head
his
whole
dress
seemed
very
fresh
and
new
and
in
fact
he
had
cast
aside
his
texan
habiliments
only
the
day
before
how
do
you
do
sir
said
the
colonel
stepping
to
the
window
and
reaching
out
of
it
the
hand
which
the
young
man
advanced
to
take
wo
you
come
in
we
at
home
here
house
i
building
oh
indeed
returned
the
young
man
and
he
came
promptly
up
the
steps
and
through
its
ribs
into
the
have
a
trestle
asked
the
colonel
while
the
girls
exchanged
little
shocks
of
terror
and
amusement
at
the
eyes
thank
you
said
the
young
man
simply
and
sat
down
lapham
is
upstairs
interviewing
the
carpenter
but
she
be
down
in
a
minute
i
hope
she
quite
well
said
corey
i
supposed
i
was
afraid
she
might
be
out
of
town
well
we
are
off
to
nantasket
next
week
the
house
kept
us
in
town
pretty
late
it
must
be
very
exciting
building
a
house
said
corey
to
the
elder
sister
yes
it
is
she
assented
loyally
refusing
in
irene
interest
the
opportunity
of
saying
anything
more
corey
turned
to
the
latter
i
suppose
you
all
helped
to
plan
it
oh
no
the
architect
and
mamma
did
that
but
they
allowed
the
rest
of
us
to
agree
when
we
were
good
said
penelope
corey
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
shorter
than
her
sister
and
had
a
dark
complexion
it
very
exciting
said
irene
come
up
said
the
colonel
rising
and
look
round
if
you
like
to
i
should
like
to
very
much
said
the
young
man
he
helped
the
young
ladies
over
crevasses
of
carpentry
and
along
narrow
paths
of
planking
on
which
they
had
made
their
way
unassisted
before
the
elder
sister
left
the
younger
to
profit
solely
by
these
offices
as
much
as
possible
she
walked
between
them
and
her
father
who
went
before
lecturing
on
each
apartment
and
taking
the
credit
of
the
whole
affair
more
and
more
as
he
talked
on
there
he
said
we
going
to
throw
out
a
here
so
as
get
the
water
all
the
way
up
and
down
this
is
my
girls
room
he
added
looking
proudly
at
them
both
it
seemed
terribly
intimate
irene
blushed
deeply
and
turned
her
head
away
but
the
young
man
took
it
all
apparently
as
simply
as
their
father
what
a
lovely
lookout
he
said
the
back
bay
spread
its
glassy
sheet
before
them
empty
but
for
a
few
small
boats
and
a
large
schooner
with
her
sails
and
dripping
like
snow
from
her
spars
which
a
tug
was
rapidly
towing
toward
cambridge
the
carpentry
of
that
city
embanked
and
embowered
in
foliage
shared
the
picturesqueness
of
charlestown
in
the
distance
yes
said
lapham
i
go
in
for
using
the
best
rooms
in
your
house
yourself
if
people
come
to
stay
with
you
they
can
put
up
with
the
second
best
though
we
do
intend
to
have
any
second
best
there
ai
going
to
be
an
unpleasant
room
in
the
whole
house
from
top
to
bottom
oh
i
wish
papa
would
brag
so
breathed
irene
to
her
sister
where
they
stood
a
little
apart
looking
away
together
the
colonel
went
on
no
sir
he
swelled
out
i
have
gone
in
for
making
a
regular
job
of
it
i
got
the
best
architect
in
boston
and
i
building
a
house
to
suit
myself
and
if
money
can
do
it
guess
going
to
be
suited
it
seems
very
delightful
said
corey
and
very
original
yes
sir
that
fellow
had
talked
five
minutes
before
i
saw
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
every
time
i
wish
mamma
would
come
breathed
irene
again
i
shall
certainly
go
through
the
floor
if
papa
says
anything
more
they
are
making
a
great
many
very
pretty
houses
nowadays
said
the
young
man
it
very
different
from
the
building
well
said
the
colonel
with
a
large
toleration
of
tone
and
a
deep
breath
that
expanded
his
ample
chest
we
spend
more
on
our
houses
nowadays
i
started
out
to
build
a
house
well
sir
that
fellow
has
got
me
in
for
more
than
sixty
thousand
already
and
i
doubt
if
i
get
out
of
it
much
under
a
hundred
you
ca
have
a
nice
house
for
nothing
it
just
like
ordering
a
picture
of
a
painter
you
pay
him
enough
and
he
can
afford
to
paint
you
a
picture
and
if
you
do
he
ca
that
all
there
is
of
it
why
they
tell
me
that
stewart
gave
one
of
those
french
fellows
sixty
thousand
dollars
for
a
little
picture
the
other
day
yes
sir
give
an
architect
money
enough
and
he
give
you
a
nice
house
every
time
i
heard
that
they
sharp
at
getting
money
to
realise
their
ideas
assented
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
well
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
the
colonel
they
come
to
you
with
an
improvement
that
you
ca
resist
it
has
good
looks
and
and
everything
in
its
favour
and
it
like
throwing
money
away
to
refuse
and
they
always
manage
to
get
you
when
your
wife
is
around
and
then
you
helpless
the
colonel
himself
set
the
example
of
laughing
at
this
joke
and
the
young
man
joined
him
less
obstreperously
the
girls
turned
and
he
said
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
this
view
to
better
advantage
surprising
how
well
the
memorial
hall
and
the
cambridge
spires
work
up
over
there
and
the
sunsets
must
be
magnificent
lapham
did
not
wait
for
them
to
reply
yes
sir
it
about
the
sightliest
view
i
know
of
i
always
did
like
the
water
side
of
beacon
long
before
i
owned
property
here
or
ever
expected
to
and
i
used
to
ride
down
this
way
and
stop
the
buggy
to
get
this
view
over
the
water
when
people
talk
to
me
about
the
hill
i
can
understand
it
snug
and
it
and
it
where
they
always
lived
but
when
they
talk
about
commonwealth
avenue
i
do
know
what
they
mean
it
do
hold
a
candle
to
the
water
side
of
beacon
you
got
just
as
much
wind
over
there
and
you
got
just
as
much
dust
and
all
the
view
you
got
is
the
view
across
the
street
no
sir
when
you
come
to
the
back
bay
at
all
give
me
the
water
side
of
beacon
oh
i
think
you
quite
right
said
the
young
man
the
view
here
is
everything
irene
looked
i
wonder
what
papa
is
going
to
say
next
at
her
sister
when
their
mother
voice
was
heard
overhead
approaching
the
opening
in
the
floor
where
the
stairs
were
to
be
and
she
presently
appeared
with
one
substantial
foot
a
long
way
ahead
she
was
followed
by
the
carpenter
with
his
rule
sticking
out
of
his
overalls
pocket
and
she
was
still
talking
to
him
about
some
measurements
they
had
been
taking
when
they
reached
the
bottom
so
that
irene
had
to
say
mamma
corey
before
lapham
was
aware
of
him
he
came
forward
with
as
much
grace
and
speed
as
the
uncertain
footing
would
allow
and
lapham
gave
him
a
stout
squeeze
of
her
comfortable
hand
why
corey
when
did
you
get
back
yesterday
it
hardly
seems
as
if
i
had
got
back
i
did
expect
to
find
you
in
a
new
house
well
you
are
our
first
caller
i
presume
you
wo
expect
i
should
make
excuses
for
the
state
you
find
it
in
has
the
colonel
been
doing
the
honours
oh
yes
and
i
seen
more
of
your
house
than
i
ever
shall
again
i
suppose
well
i
hope
not
said
lapham
there
be
several
chances
to
see
us
in
the
old
one
yet
before
we
leave
he
probably
thought
this
a
neat
way
of
making
the
invitation
for
he
looked
at
his
as
if
he
might
expect
their
admiration
oh
yes
indeed
said
his
wife
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
corey
any
time
thank
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
come
he
and
the
colonel
went
before
and
helped
the
ladies
down
the
difficult
descent
irene
seemed
less
than
the
others
she
clung
to
the
young
man
hand
an
imperceptible
moment
longer
than
need
be
or
else
he
detained
her
he
found
opportunity
of
saying
it
so
pleasant
seeing
you
again
adding
all
of
you
thank
you
said
the
girl
they
must
all
be
glad
to
have
you
at
home
again
corey
laughed
well
i
suppose
they
would
be
if
they
were
at
home
to
have
me
but
the
fact
is
there
nobody
in
the
house
but
my
father
and
myself
and
i
only
on
my
way
to
bar
harbour
oh
are
they
there
yes
it
seems
to
be
the
only
place
where
my
mother
can
get
just
the
combination
of
sea
and
mountain
air
that
she
wants
we
go
to
nantasket
it
convenient
for
papa
and
i
do
believe
we
shall
go
anywhere
else
this
summer
mamma
so
taken
up
with
building
we
do
nothing
but
talk
house
and
pen
says
we
eat
and
sleep
house
she
says
it
would
be
a
sort
of
relief
to
go
and
live
in
tents
for
a
while
she
seems
to
have
a
good
deal
of
humour
the
young
man
ventured
upon
the
slender
evidence
the
others
had
gone
to
the
back
of
the
house
a
moment
to
look
at
some
suggested
change
irene
and
corey
were
left
standing
in
the
doorway
a
lovely
light
of
happiness
played
over
her
face
and
etherealised
its
delicious
beauty
she
had
some
ado
to
keep
herself
from
smiling
outright
and
the
effort
deepened
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks
she
trembled
a
little
and
the
pendants
shook
in
the
tips
of
her
pretty
ears
the
others
came
back
directly
and
they
all
descended
the
front
steps
together
the
colonel
was
about
to
renew
his
invitation
but
he
caught
his
wife
eye
and
without
being
able
to
interpret
its
warning
exactly
was
able
to
arrest
himself
and
went
about
gathering
up
the
while
the
young
man
handed
the
ladies
into
the
phaeton
then
he
lifted
his
hat
and
the
ladies
all
bowed
and
the
laphams
drove
off
irene
blue
ribbons
fluttering
backward
from
her
hat
as
if
they
were
her
clinging
thoughts
so
that
young
corey
is
it
said
the
colonel
letting
the
stately
stepping
tall
coupe
horse
make
his
way
homeward
at
will
with
the
well
he
ai
a
fellow
and
he
got
a
good
fair
and
square
honest
eye
but
i
do
see
how
a
fellow
like
that
that
had
every
advantage
in
this
world
can
hang
round
home
and
let
his
father
support
him
seems
to
me
if
i
had
his
health
and
his
education
i
should
want
to
strike
out
and
do
something
for
myself
the
girls
on
the
back
seat
had
hold
of
each
other
hands
and
they
exchanged
electrical
pressures
at
the
different
points
their
father
made
i
presume
said
lapham
that
he
was
down
in
texas
looking
after
something
he
come
back
without
finding
it
i
guess
well
if
his
father
has
the
money
to
support
him
and
do
complain
of
the
burden
i
do
see
why
we
should
oh
i
know
it
none
of
my
business
but
i
do
like
the
principle
i
like
to
see
a
man
act
like
a
man
i
do
like
to
see
him
taken
care
of
like
a
young
lady
now
i
suppose
that
fellow
belongs
to
two
or
three
clubs
and
hangs
around
all
day
lookin
out
the
window
i
seen
instead
of
tryin
to
hunt
up
something
to
do
for
an
honest
livin
if
i
was
a
young
man
penelope
struck
in
i
would
belong
to
twenty
clubs
if
i
could
find
them
and
i
would
hang
around
them
all
and
look
out
the
window
till
i
dropped
oh
you
would
would
you
demanded
her
father
delighted
with
her
defiance
and
twisting
his
fat
head
around
over
his
shoulder
to
look
at
her
well
you
would
do
it
on
my
money
if
you
were
a
son
of
mine
young
lady
oh
you
wait
and
see
retorted
the
girl
this
made
them
all
laugh
but
the
colonel
recurred
seriously
to
the
subject
that
night
as
he
was
winding
up
his
watch
preparatory
to
putting
it
under
his
pillow
i
could
make
a
man
of
that
fellow
if
i
had
him
in
the
business
with
me
there
stuff
in
him
but
i
spoke
up
the
way
i
did
because
i
did
choose
irene
should
think
i
would
stand
any
kind
of
a
loafer
i
do
care
who
he
is
or
how
well
educated
or
brought
up
and
i
guess
from
the
way
pen
spoke
up
that
saw
what
i
was
driving
at
the
girl
apparently
was
less
anxious
about
her
father
ideas
and
principles
than
about
the
impression
which
he
had
made
upon
the
young
man
she
had
talked
it
over
and
over
with
her
sister
before
they
went
to
bed
and
she
asked
in
despair
as
she
stood
looking
at
penelope
brushing
out
her
hair
before
the
glass
do
you
suppose
he
think
papa
always
talks
in
that
bragging
way
he
be
right
if
he
does
answered
her
sister
it
the
way
father
always
does
talk
you
never
noticed
it
so
much
that
all
and
i
guess
if
he
ca
make
allowance
for
father
bragging
he
be
a
little
too
good
i
enjoyed
hearing
the
colonel
go
on
i
know
you
did
returned
irene
in
distress
then
she
sighed
did
you
think
he
looked
very
nice
who
the
colonel
penelope
had
caught
up
the
habit
of
calling
her
father
so
from
her
mother
and
she
used
his
title
in
all
her
jocose
and
perverse
moods
you
know
very
well
i
do
mean
papa
pouted
irene
oh
corey
why
did
you
say
corey
if
you
meant
corey
if
i
meant
corey
i
should
say
corey
it
is
swearing
corey
corey
co
her
sister
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
will
you
hush
you
wretched
thing
she
whimpered
the
whole
house
can
hear
you
oh
yes
they
can
hear
me
all
over
the
square
well
i
think
he
looked
well
enough
for
a
plain
youth
who
had
taken
his
hair
out
of
for
some
time
it
was
clipped
pretty
close
irene
admitted
and
they
both
laughed
at
the
drab
effect
of
corey
skull
as
they
remembered
it
did
you
like
his
nose
asked
irene
timorously
ah
now
you
coming
to
something
said
penelope
i
do
know
whether
if
i
had
so
much
of
a
nose
i
should
want
it
all
roman
i
do
see
how
you
can
expect
to
have
a
nose
part
one
kind
and
part
another
argued
irene
oh
i
do
look
at
mine
she
turned
aside
her
face
so
as
to
get
a
view
of
her
nose
in
the
glass
and
crossing
her
hands
with
the
brush
in
one
of
them
before
her
regarded
it
judicially
now
my
nose
started
grecian
but
changed
its
mind
before
it
got
over
the
bridge
and
concluded
to
be
snub
the
rest
of
the
way
you
got
a
very
pretty
nose
pen
said
irene
joining
in
the
contemplation
of
its
reflex
in
the
glass
do
say
that
in
hopes
of
getting
me
to
compliment
his
she
stopped
and
then
added
deliberately
irene
also
had
her
in
her
hand
and
now
she
sprang
at
her
sister
and
beat
her
very
softly
on
the
shoulder
with
the
flat
of
it
you
mean
thing
she
cried
between
her
shut
teeth
blushing
hotly
well
then
said
penelope
you
nothing
to
say
against
though
i
think
is
just
as
nice
an
initial
oh
cried
the
younger
for
all
expression
of
unspeakable
things
i
think
he
has
very
good
eyes
admitted
penelope
oh
he
has
and
did
you
like
the
way
his
sackcoat
set
so
close
to
him
and
yet
free
kind
of
peeling
away
at
the
lapels
yes
i
should
say
he
was
a
young
man
of
great
judgment
he
knows
how
to
choose
his
tailor
irene
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
it
was
so
nice
of
you
pen
to
come
in
that
way
about
clubs
oh
i
did
mean
anything
by
it
except
opposition
said
penelope
i
could
have
father
swelling
on
so
without
saying
something
how
he
did
swell
sighed
irene
was
it
a
relief
to
have
mamma
come
down
even
if
she
did
seem
to
be
all
stocking
at
first
the
girls
broke
into
a
wild
giggle
and
hid
their
faces
in
each
necks
i
thought
i
should
die
said
irene
just
like
ordering
a
painting
said
penelope
recalling
her
father
talk
with
an
effect
of
dreamy
give
the
painter
money
enough
and
he
can
afford
to
paint
you
a
picture
give
an
architect
money
enough
and
he
give
you
a
house
every
time
oh
was
it
awful
moaned
her
sister
no
one
would
ever
have
supposed
that
he
had
fought
the
very
idea
of
an
architect
for
weeks
before
he
gave
in
penelope
went
on
always
did
like
the
water
side
of
beacon
long
before
i
owned
property
there
when
you
come
to
the
back
bay
at
all
give
me
the
water
side
of
beacon
shrieked
irene
do
stop
the
door
of
their
mother
chamber
opened
below
and
the
voice
of
the
real
colonel
called
what
are
you
doing
up
there
girls
why
do
you
go
to
bed
this
extorted
nervous
shrieks
from
both
of
them
the
colonel
heard
a
sound
of
scurrying
feet
whisking
drapery
and
slamming
doors
then
he
heard
one
of
the
doors
opened
again
and
penelope
said
i
was
only
repeating
something
you
said
when
you
talked
to
mr
corey
very
well
now
answered
the
colonel
you
postpone
the
rest
of
it
till
at
breakfast
and
see
that
you
up
in
time
to
let
me
hear
it
at
the
same
moment
young
corey
let
himself
in
at
his
own
door
with
his
and
went
to
the
library
where
he
found
his
father
turning
the
last
leaves
of
a
story
in
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
he
was
a
old
gentleman
who
had
never
been
able
to
abandon
his
for
the
superior
comfort
of
spectacles
even
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
library
he
knocked
the
glasses
off
as
his
son
came
in
and
looked
up
at
him
with
lazy
fondness
rubbing
the
two
red
marks
that
they
always
leave
on
the
side
of
the
nose
tom
he
said
where
did
you
get
such
good
clothes
i
stopped
over
a
day
in
new
york
replied
the
son
finding
himself
a
chair
i
glad
you
like
them
yes
i
always
do
like
your
clothes
tom
returned
the
father
thoughtfully
swinging
his
glasses
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
afford
i
ca
well
sir
said
the
son
who
dropped
the
sir
into
his
speech
with
his
father
now
and
then
in
an
way
that
was
rather
charming
you
see
i
have
an
indulgent
parent
smoke
suggested
the
father
pushing
toward
his
son
a
box
of
cigarettes
from
which
he
had
taken
one
no
thank
you
said
the
son
i
dropped
that
ah
is
that
so
the
father
began
to
feel
about
on
the
table
for
matches
in
the
purblind
fashion
of
elderly
men
his
son
rose
lighted
one
and
handed
it
to
him
well
oh
thank
you
tom
i
believe
some
statisticians
prove
that
if
you
will
give
up
smoking
you
can
dress
very
well
on
the
money
your
tobacco
costs
even
if
you
have
got
an
indulgent
parent
but
i
too
old
to
try
though
i
confess
i
should
rather
like
the
clothes
whom
did
you
find
at
the
club
there
were
a
lot
of
fellows
there
said
young
corey
watching
the
accomplished
fumigation
of
his
father
in
an
absent
way
it
astonishing
what
a
hardy
breed
the
young
are
observed
his
father
all
summer
through
in
weather
that
sends
the
sturdiest
female
flying
to
the
you
find
the
clubs
filled
with
young
men
who
do
seem
to
mind
the
heat
in
the
least
boston
is
a
bad
place
at
the
worst
in
summer
said
the
son
declining
to
take
up
the
matter
in
its
ironical
shape
i
dare
say
it
is
compared
with
texas
returned
the
father
smoking
tranquilly
on
but
i
do
suppose
you
find
many
of
your
friends
in
town
outside
of
the
club
no
you
requested
to
ring
at
the
rear
door
all
the
way
down
beacon
street
and
up
commonwealth
avenue
it
rather
a
blank
reception
for
the
returning
prodigal
ah
the
prodigal
must
take
his
chance
if
he
comes
back
out
of
season
but
i
glad
to
have
you
back
tom
even
as
it
is
and
i
hope
not
going
to
hurry
away
you
must
give
your
energies
a
rest
i
sure
you
never
had
to
reproach
me
with
abnormal
activity
suggested
the
son
taking
his
father
jokes
in
good
part
no
i
do
know
that
i
have
admitted
the
elder
you
always
shown
a
fair
degree
of
moderation
after
all
what
do
you
think
of
taking
up
next
i
mean
after
you
have
embraced
your
mother
and
sisters
at
mount
desert
real
estate
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
about
time
for
you
to
open
out
as
a
broker
or
did
you
ever
think
of
matrimony
well
not
just
in
that
way
sir
said
the
young
man
i
quite
like
to
regard
it
as
a
career
you
know
no
no
i
understand
that
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
but
you
know
i
always
contended
that
the
affections
could
be
made
to
combine
pleasure
and
profit
i
would
have
a
man
marry
for
money
that
would
be
rather
bad
but
i
do
see
why
when
it
comes
to
falling
in
love
a
man
should
fall
in
love
with
a
rich
girl
as
easily
as
a
poor
one
some
of
the
rich
girls
are
very
nice
and
i
should
say
that
the
chances
of
a
quiet
life
with
them
were
rather
greater
they
always
had
everything
and
they
would
be
so
ambitious
and
uneasy
you
think
so
it
would
depend
said
the
son
upon
whether
a
girl
people
had
been
rich
long
enough
to
have
given
her
position
before
she
married
if
they
had
i
do
see
how
she
would
be
any
better
than
a
poor
girl
in
that
respect
yes
there
sense
in
that
but
the
suddenly
rich
are
on
a
level
with
any
of
us
nowadays
money
buys
position
at
once
i
do
say
that
it
is
all
right
the
world
generally
knows
what
it
about
and
knows
how
to
drive
a
bargain
i
dare
say
it
makes
the
new
rich
pay
too
much
but
there
no
doubt
but
money
is
to
the
fore
now
it
is
the
romance
the
poetry
of
our
age
it
the
thing
that
chiefly
strikes
the
imagination
the
englishmen
who
come
here
are
more
curious
about
the
great
new
millionaires
than
about
any
one
else
and
they
respect
them
more
it
all
very
well
i
do
complain
of
it
and
you
would
like
a
rich
quite
regardless
then
oh
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
tom
said
his
father
a
little
youth
a
little
beauty
a
little
good
sense
and
pretty
behaviour
one
object
to
those
things
and
they
go
just
as
often
with
money
as
without
it
and
i
suppose
i
should
like
her
people
to
be
rather
grammatical
it
seems
to
me
that
you
exacting
sir
said
the
son
how
can
you
expect
people
who
have
been
strictly
devoted
to
business
to
be
grammatical
is
that
rather
too
much
perhaps
it
is
perhaps
you
right
but
i
understood
your
mother
to
say
that
those
benefactors
of
hers
whom
you
met
last
summer
were
very
passably
grammatical
the
father
is
the
elder
who
had
been
smoking
with
his
profile
toward
his
son
now
turned
his
face
full
upon
him
i
did
know
you
had
seen
him
i
had
until
said
young
corey
with
a
little
heightening
of
his
colour
but
i
was
walking
down
street
this
afternoon
and
happened
to
look
round
at
a
new
house
some
one
was
putting
up
and
i
saw
the
whole
family
in
the
window
it
appears
that
lapham
is
building
the
house
the
elder
corey
knocked
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
into
the
holder
at
his
elbow
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
the
longer
i
know
you
tom
that
we
are
descended
from
giles
corey
the
gift
of
holding
one
tongue
seems
to
have
skipped
me
but
you
have
it
in
full
force
i
ca
say
just
how
you
would
behave
under
peine
forte
et
dure
but
under
ordinary
pressure
you
are
certainly
able
to
keep
your
own
counsel
why
you
mention
this
encounter
at
dinner
you
were
asked
to
plead
to
an
accusation
of
witchcraft
no
not
exactly
said
the
young
man
but
i
did
quite
see
my
way
to
speaking
of
it
we
had
a
good
many
other
things
before
us
yes
that
true
i
suppose
you
would
have
mentioned
it
now
if
i
had
led
up
to
it
would
you
i
do
know
sir
it
was
rather
on
my
mind
to
do
so
perhaps
it
was
i
who
led
up
to
it
his
father
laughed
perhaps
you
did
tom
perhaps
you
did
your
mother
would
have
known
you
were
leading
up
to
something
but
confess
that
i
did
what
is
it
nothing
very
definite
but
do
you
know
that
in
spite
of
his
syntax
i
rather
liked
him
the
father
looked
keenly
at
the
son
but
unless
the
boy
full
confidence
was
offered
corey
was
not
the
man
to
ask
it
well
was
all
that
he
said
i
suppose
that
in
a
new
country
one
gets
to
looking
at
people
a
little
out
of
our
tradition
and
i
dare
say
that
if
i
had
passed
a
winter
in
texas
i
might
have
found
colonel
lapham
rather
too
much
you
mean
that
there
are
worse
things
in
texas
not
that
exactly
i
mean
that
i
saw
it
would
be
quite
fair
to
test
him
by
our
standards
this
comes
of
the
error
which
i
have
often
deprecated
said
the
elder
corey
in
fact
i
am
always
saying
that
the
bostonian
ought
never
to
leave
boston
then
he
knows
and
then
only
that
there
can
be
no
standard
but
ours
but
we
are
constantly
going
away
and
coming
back
with
our
convictions
shaken
to
their
foundations
one
man
goes
to
england
and
returns
with
the
conception
of
a
grander
social
life
another
comes
home
from
germany
with
the
notion
of
a
more
searching
intellectual
activity
a
fellow
just
back
from
paris
has
the
absurdest
ideas
of
art
and
literature
and
you
revert
to
us
from
the
cowboys
of
texas
and
tell
us
to
our
faces
that
we
ought
to
try
papa
lapham
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
it
ought
to
be
stopped
it
ought
really
the
bostonian
who
leaves
boston
ought
to
be
condemned
to
perpetual
exile
the
son
suffered
the
father
to
reach
his
climax
with
smiling
patience
when
he
asked
finally
what
are
the
characteristics
of
papa
lapham
that
place
him
beyond
our
jurisdiction
the
younger
corey
crossed
his
long
legs
and
leaned
forward
to
take
one
of
his
knees
between
his
hands
well
sir
he
bragged
rather
oh
i
do
know
that
bragging
should
exempt
him
from
the
ordinary
processes
i
heard
other
people
brag
in
boston
ah
not
just
in
that
personal
way
not
about
money
no
that
was
certainly
different
i
do
mean
said
the
young
fellow
with
the
scrupulosity
which
people
could
not
help
observing
and
liking
in
him
that
it
was
more
than
an
indirect
expression
of
satisfaction
in
the
ability
to
spend
no
i
should
be
glad
to
express
something
of
the
kind
myself
if
the
facts
would
justify
me
the
son
smiled
tolerantly
again
but
if
he
was
enjoying
his
money
in
that
way
i
did
see
why
he
should
show
his
pleasure
in
it
it
might
have
been
vulgar
but
it
was
sordid
and
i
do
know
that
it
was
vulgar
perhaps
his
successful
strokes
of
business
were
the
romance
of
his
life
the
father
interrupted
with
a
laugh
the
girl
must
be
uncommonly
pretty
what
did
she
seem
to
think
of
her
father
brag
there
were
two
of
them
answered
the
son
evasively
oh
two
and
is
the
sister
pretty
too
not
pretty
but
rather
interesting
she
is
like
her
mother
then
the
pretty
one
is
the
father
pet
i
ca
say
sir
i
do
believe
added
the
young
fellow
that
i
can
make
you
see
colonel
lapham
just
as
i
did
he
struck
me
as
very
and
rather
wholesome
of
course
he
could
be
tiresome
we
all
can
and
i
suppose
his
range
of
ideas
is
limited
but
he
is
a
force
and
not
a
bad
one
if
he
has
got
over
being
surprised
at
the
effect
of
rubbing
his
lamp
oh
one
could
make
out
a
case
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
are
about
tom
but
remember
that
we
are
essex
county
people
and
that
in
savour
we
are
just
a
little
beyond
the
salt
of
the
earth
i
will
tell
you
plainly
that
i
do
like
the
notion
of
a
man
who
has
rivalled
the
hues
of
nature
in
her
wildest
haunts
with
the
tints
of
his
mineral
paint
but
i
do
say
there
are
not
worse
men
he
is
to
my
taste
though
he
might
be
ever
so
much
to
my
conscience
i
suppose
said
the
son
that
there
is
nothing
really
to
be
ashamed
of
in
mineral
paint
people
go
into
all
sorts
of
things
his
father
took
his
cigarette
from
his
mouth
and
once
more
looked
his
son
full
in
the
face
oh
is
that
it
it
has
crossed
my
mind
admitted
the
son
i
must
do
something
i
wasted
time
and
money
enough
i
seen
much
younger
men
all
through
the
west
and
taking
care
of
themselves
i
think
i
was
particularly
fit
for
anything
out
there
but
i
am
ashamed
to
come
back
and
live
upon
you
sir
his
father
shook
his
head
with
an
ironical
sigh
ah
we
shall
never
have
a
real
aristocracy
while
this
plebeian
reluctance
to
live
upon
a
parent
or
a
wife
continues
the
animating
spirit
of
our
youth
it
strikes
at
the
root
of
the
whole
feudal
system
i
really
think
you
owe
me
an
apology
tom
i
supposed
you
wished
to
marry
the
girl
money
and
here
you
are
basely
seeking
to
go
into
business
with
her
father
young
corey
laughed
again
like
a
son
who
perceives
that
his
father
is
a
little
antiquated
but
keeps
a
filial
faith
in
his
wit
i
do
know
that
it
quite
so
bad
as
that
but
the
thing
had
certainly
crossed
my
mind
i
do
know
how
it
to
be
approached
and
i
do
know
that
it
at
all
possible
but
i
confess
that
i
to
colonel
lapham
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
he
looked
as
if
he
business
and
i
mean
business
too
the
father
smoked
thoughtfully
of
course
people
do
go
into
all
sorts
of
things
as
you
say
and
i
do
know
that
one
thing
is
more
ignoble
than
another
if
it
decent
and
large
enough
in
my
time
you
would
have
gone
into
the
china
trade
or
the
india
trade
though
i
did
and
a
little
later
cotton
would
have
been
your
manifest
destiny
though
it
was
mine
but
now
a
man
may
do
almost
anything
the
business
is
pretty
full
yes
if
you
have
a
deep
inward
vocation
for
it
i
do
see
why
mineral
paint
should
do
i
fancy
it
easy
enough
approaching
the
matter
we
will
invite
papa
lapham
to
dinner
and
talk
it
over
with
him
oh
i
do
think
that
would
be
exactly
the
way
sir
said
the
son
smiling
at
his
father
patrician
unworldliness
no
why
not
i
afraid
it
would
be
a
bad
start
i
do
think
it
would
strike
him
as
i
do
see
why
he
should
be
punctilious
if
we
not
ah
we
might
say
that
if
he
were
making
the
advances
well
perhaps
you
are
right
tom
what
is
your
idea
i
have
a
very
clear
one
it
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
get
some
business
friend
of
ours
whose
judgment
he
would
respect
to
speak
a
good
word
for
me
give
you
a
character
yes
and
of
course
i
must
go
to
colonel
lapham
my
notion
would
be
to
inquire
pretty
thoroughly
about
him
and
then
if
i
liked
the
look
of
things
to
go
right
down
to
republic
street
and
let
him
see
what
he
could
do
with
me
if
anything
that
sounds
tremendously
practical
to
me
tom
though
it
may
be
just
the
wrong
way
when
are
you
going
down
to
mount
desert
i
think
sir
said
the
young
man
i
shall
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
while
i
off
the
father
rose
showing
something
more
than
his
son
height
with
a
very
slight
stoop
which
the
son
figure
had
not
well
he
said
whimsically
i
admire
your
spirit
and
i
do
deny
that
it
is
justified
by
necessity
it
a
consolation
to
think
that
while
been
spending
and
enjoying
i
have
been
preparing
the
noblest
future
for
you
a
future
of
industry
and
you
never
could
draw
but
this
scheme
of
going
into
the
business
shows
that
you
have
inherited
something
of
my
feeling
for
colour
the
son
laughed
once
more
and
waiting
till
his
father
was
well
on
his
way
upstairs
turned
out
the
gas
and
then
hurried
after
him
and
preceded
him
into
his
chamber
he
glanced
over
it
to
see
that
everything
was
there
to
his
father
hand
then
he
said
good
night
sir
and
the
elder
responded
good
night
my
son
and
the
son
went
to
his
own
room
over
the
mantel
in
the
elder
corey
room
hung
a
portrait
which
he
had
painted
of
his
own
father
and
now
he
stood
a
moment
and
looked
at
this
as
if
struck
by
something
novel
in
it
the
resemblance
between
his
son
and
the
old
india
merchant
who
had
followed
the
trade
from
salem
to
boston
when
the
larger
city
drew
it
away
from
the
smaller
must
have
been
what
struck
him
grandfather
and
grandson
had
both
the
roman
nose
which
appears
to
have
flourished
chiefly
at
the
formative
period
of
the
republic
and
which
occurs
more
rarely
in
the
descendants
of
the
conscript
fathers
though
it
still
characterises
the
profiles
of
a
good
many
boston
ladies
bromfield
corey
had
not
inherited
it
and
he
had
made
his
straight
nose
his
defence
when
the
old
merchant
accused
him
of
a
want
of
energy
he
said
what
could
a
man
do
whose
unnatural
father
had
left
his
own
nose
away
from
him
this
amused
but
did
not
satisfy
the
merchant
you
must
do
something
he
said
and
it
for
you
to
choose
if
you
do
like
the
india
trade
go
into
something
else
or
take
up
law
or
medicine
no
corey
yet
ever
proposed
to
do
nothing
ah
then
it
quite
time
one
of
us
made
a
beginning
urged
the
man
who
was
then
young
and
who
was
now
old
looking
into
the
somewhat
fierce
eyes
of
his
father
portrait
he
had
inherited
as
little
of
the
fierceness
as
of
the
nose
and
there
was
nothing
predatory
in
his
son
either
though
the
aquiline
beak
had
come
down
to
him
in
such
force
bromfield
corey
liked
his
son
tom
for
the
gentleness
which
tempered
his
energy
well
let
us
compromise
he
seemed
to
be
saying
to
his
portrait
i
will
travel
travel
how
long
the
keen
eyes
demanded
oh
indefinitely
i
wo
be
hard
with
you
father
he
could
see
the
eyes
soften
and
the
smile
of
yielding
come
over
his
father
face
the
merchant
could
not
resist
a
son
who
was
so
much
like
his
dead
mother
there
was
some
vague
understanding
between
them
that
bromfield
corey
was
to
come
back
and
go
into
business
after
a
time
but
he
never
did
so
he
travelled
about
over
europe
and
travelled
handsomely
frequenting
good
society
everywhere
and
getting
himself
presented
at
several
courts
at
a
period
when
it
was
a
distinction
to
do
so
he
had
always
sketched
and
with
his
father
leave
he
fixed
himself
at
rome
where
he
remained
studying
art
and
rounding
the
being
inherited
from
his
yankee
progenitors
till
there
was
very
little
left
of
the
ancestral
angularities
after
ten
years
he
came
home
and
painted
that
portrait
of
his
father
it
was
very
good
if
a
little
amateurish
and
he
might
have
made
himself
a
name
as
a
painter
of
portraits
if
he
had
not
had
so
much
money
but
he
had
plenty
of
money
though
by
this
time
he
was
married
and
beginning
to
have
a
family
it
was
absurd
for
him
to
paint
portraits
for
pay
and
ridiculous
to
paint
them
for
nothing
so
he
did
not
paint
them
at
all
he
continued
a
dilettante
never
quite
abandoning
his
art
but
working
at
it
fitfully
and
talking
more
about
it
than
working
at
it
he
had
his
theory
of
titian
method
and
now
and
then
a
bostonian
insisted
upon
buying
a
picture
of
him
after
a
while
he
hung
it
more
and
more
inconspicuously
and
said
apologetically
oh
yes
that
one
of
bromfield
corey
things
it
has
nice
qualities
but
it
amateurish
in
process
of
time
the
money
seemed
less
abundant
there
were
shrinkages
of
one
kind
and
another
and
living
had
grown
much
more
expensive
and
luxurious
for
many
years
he
talked
about
going
back
to
rome
but
he
never
went
and
his
children
grew
up
in
the
usual
way
before
he
knew
it
his
son
had
him
out
to
his
spread
at
harvard
and
then
he
had
his
son
on
his
hands
the
son
made
various
unsuccessful
provisions
for
himself
and
still
continued
upon
his
father
hands
to
their
common
dissatisfaction
though
it
was
chiefly
the
younger
who
repined
he
had
the
roman
nose
and
the
energy
without
the
opportunity
and
at
one
of
the
reversions
his
father
said
to
him
you
ought
not
to
have
that
nose
tom
then
you
would
do
very
well
you
would
go
and
travel
as
i
did
lapham
and
his
wife
continued
talking
after
he
had
quelled
the
disturbance
in
his
daughters
room
overhead
and
their
talk
was
not
altogether
of
the
new
house
i
tell
you
he
said
if
i
had
that
fellow
in
the
business
with
me
i
would
make
a
man
of
him
well
silas
lapham
returned
his
wife
i
do
believe
you
got
mineral
paint
on
the
brain
do
you
suppose
a
fellow
like
young
corey
brought
up
the
way
he
been
would
touch
mineral
paint
with
a
pole
why
not
haughtily
asked
the
colonel
well
if
you
do
know
already
there
no
use
trying
to
tell
you
vi
the
coreys
had
always
had
a
house
at
nahant
but
after
letting
it
for
a
season
or
two
they
found
they
could
get
on
without
it
and
sold
it
at
the
son
instance
who
foresaw
that
if
things
went
on
as
they
were
going
the
family
would
be
straitened
to
the
point
of
changing
their
mode
of
life
altogether
they
began
to
be
of
the
people
of
whom
it
was
said
that
they
stayed
in
town
very
late
and
when
the
ladies
did
go
away
it
was
for
a
brief
summering
in
this
place
and
that
the
father
remained
at
home
altogether
and
the
son
joined
them
in
the
intervals
of
his
enterprises
which
occurred
only
too
often
at
bar
harbour
where
he
now
went
to
find
them
after
his
winter
in
texas
he
confessed
to
his
mother
that
there
seemed
no
very
good
opening
there
for
him
he
might
do
as
well
as
loring
stanton
but
he
doubted
if
stanton
was
doing
very
well
then
he
mentioned
the
new
project
which
he
had
been
thinking
over
she
did
not
deny
that
there
was
something
in
it
but
she
could
not
think
of
any
young
man
who
had
gone
into
such
a
business
as
that
and
it
appeared
to
her
that
he
might
as
well
go
into
a
patent
medicine
or
a
there
was
one
of
his
hideous
advertisements
she
said
painted
on
a
reef
that
we
saw
as
we
came
down
corey
smiled
well
i
suppose
if
it
was
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
that
is
proof
positive
of
the
efficacy
of
the
paint
on
the
hulls
of
vessels
it
very
distasteful
to
me
tom
said
his
mother
and
if
there
was
something
else
in
her
mind
she
did
not
speak
more
plainly
of
it
than
to
add
it
not
only
the
kind
of
business
but
the
kind
of
people
you
would
be
mixed
up
with
i
thought
you
did
find
them
so
very
bad
suggested
corey
i
had
seen
them
in
nankeen
square
then
you
can
see
them
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
street
when
you
go
back
then
he
told
of
his
encounter
with
the
lapham
family
in
their
new
house
at
the
end
his
mother
merely
said
it
is
getting
very
common
down
there
and
she
did
not
try
to
oppose
anything
further
to
his
scheme
the
young
man
went
to
see
colonel
lapham
shortly
after
his
return
to
boston
he
paid
his
visit
at
lapham
office
and
if
he
had
studied
simplicity
in
his
summer
dress
he
could
not
have
presented
himself
in
a
figure
more
to
the
mind
of
a
practical
man
his
hands
and
neck
still
kept
the
brown
of
the
texan
suns
and
winds
and
he
looked
as
as
lapham
himself
he
spoke
up
promptly
and
briskly
in
the
outer
office
and
caused
the
pretty
girl
to
look
away
from
her
copying
at
him
is
lapham
in
he
asked
and
after
that
moment
for
reflection
which
an
array
of
so
addressed
likes
to
give
the
inquirer
a
head
was
lifted
from
a
ledger
and
nodded
toward
the
inner
office
lapham
had
recognised
the
voice
and
he
was
standing
in
considerable
perplexity
to
receive
corey
when
the
young
man
opened
his
painted
glass
door
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
lapham
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
scarcely
a
trace
of
the
boastful
hospitality
with
which
he
had
welcomed
corey
to
his
house
a
few
days
before
lingered
in
his
present
address
he
looked
at
the
young
man
face
as
if
he
expected
him
to
despatch
whatever
unimaginable
affair
he
had
come
upon
wo
you
sit
down
how
are
you
you
excuse
me
he
added
in
brief
allusion
to
the
i
about
roasted
corey
laughed
i
wish
you
let
me
take
off
my
coat
why
take
it
off
cried
the
colonel
with
instant
pleasure
there
is
something
in
human
nature
which
causes
the
man
in
his
to
wish
all
other
men
to
appear
in
the
same
deshabille
i
will
if
you
ask
me
after
i
talked
with
you
two
minutes
said
the
young
fellow
companionably
pulling
up
the
chair
offered
him
toward
the
desk
where
lapham
had
again
seated
himself
but
perhaps
you
have
got
two
minutes
to
give
me
oh
yes
i
have
said
the
colonel
i
was
just
going
to
knock
off
i
can
give
you
twenty
and
then
i
shall
have
fifteen
minutes
to
catch
the
boat
all
right
said
corey
i
want
you
to
take
me
into
the
mineral
paint
business
the
colonel
sat
dumb
he
twisted
his
thick
neck
and
looked
round
at
the
door
to
see
if
it
was
shut
he
would
not
have
liked
to
have
any
of
those
fellows
outside
hear
him
but
there
is
no
saying
what
sum
of
money
he
would
not
have
given
if
his
wife
had
been
there
to
hear
what
corey
had
just
said
i
suppose
continued
the
young
man
i
could
have
got
several
people
whose
names
you
know
to
back
my
industry
and
sobriety
and
say
a
word
for
my
business
capacity
but
i
thought
i
would
trouble
anybody
for
certificates
till
i
found
whether
there
was
a
chance
or
the
ghost
of
one
of
your
wanting
me
so
i
came
straight
to
you
lapham
gathered
himself
together
as
well
as
he
could
he
had
not
yet
forgiven
corey
for
lapham
insinuation
that
he
would
feel
himself
too
good
for
the
mineral
paint
business
and
though
he
was
dispersed
by
that
astounding
shot
at
first
he
was
not
going
to
let
any
one
even
hypothetically
despise
his
paint
with
impunity
how
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
take
you
on
they
took
on
hands
at
the
works
and
lapham
put
it
as
if
corey
were
a
hand
coming
to
him
for
employment
whether
he
satisfied
himself
by
this
or
not
he
reddened
a
little
after
he
had
said
it
corey
answered
ignorant
of
the
offence
i
have
a
very
clear
idea
i
afraid
but
i
been
looking
a
little
into
the
matter
from
the
outside
i
hope
you
hai
been
paying
any
attention
to
that
fellow
stuff
in
the
events
lapham
interrupted
since
bartley
interview
had
appeared
lapham
had
regarded
it
with
very
mixed
feelings
at
first
it
gave
him
a
glow
of
secret
pleasure
blended
with
doubt
as
to
how
his
wife
would
like
the
use
bartley
had
made
of
her
in
it
but
she
had
not
seemed
to
notice
it
much
and
lapham
had
experienced
the
gratitude
of
the
man
who
escapes
then
his
girls
had
begun
to
make
fun
of
it
and
though
he
did
not
mind
penelope
jokes
much
he
did
not
like
to
see
that
irene
gentility
was
wounded
business
friends
met
him
with
the
kind
of
knowing
smile
about
it
that
implied
their
sense
of
the
fraudulent
character
of
its
praise
the
smile
of
men
who
had
been
there
and
who
knew
how
it
was
themselves
lapham
had
his
misgivings
as
to
how
his
clerks
and
underlings
looked
at
it
he
treated
them
with
stately
severity
for
a
while
after
it
came
out
and
he
ended
by
feeling
rather
sore
about
it
he
took
it
for
granted
that
everybody
had
read
it
i
do
know
what
you
mean
replied
corey
i
do
see
the
events
regularly
oh
it
was
nothing
they
sent
a
fellow
down
here
to
interview
me
and
he
got
everything
about
as
twisted
as
he
could
i
believe
they
always
do
said
corey
i
had
seen
it
perhaps
it
came
out
before
i
got
home
perhaps
it
did
my
notion
of
making
myself
useful
to
you
was
based
on
a
hint
i
got
from
one
of
your
own
circulars
lapham
was
proud
of
those
circulars
he
thought
they
read
very
well
what
was
that
i
could
put
a
little
capital
into
the
business
said
corey
with
the
tentative
accent
of
a
man
who
chances
a
thing
i
got
a
little
money
but
i
did
imagine
you
cared
for
anything
of
that
kind
no
sir
i
do
returned
the
colonel
bluntly
i
had
one
partner
and
one
enough
yes
assented
the
young
man
who
doubtless
had
his
own
ideas
as
to
eventualities
or
perhaps
rather
had
the
vague
hopes
of
youth
i
did
come
to
propose
a
partnership
but
i
see
that
you
are
introducing
your
paint
into
the
foreign
markets
and
there
i
really
thought
i
might
be
of
use
to
you
and
to
myself
too
how
asked
the
colonel
scantly
well
i
know
two
or
three
languages
pretty
well
i
know
french
and
i
know
german
and
i
got
a
pretty
fair
sprinkling
of
spanish
you
mean
that
you
can
talk
them
asked
the
colonel
with
the
mingled
awe
and
slight
that
such
a
man
feels
for
such
accomplishments
yes
and
i
can
write
an
intelligible
letter
in
either
of
them
lapham
rubbed
his
nose
it
easy
enough
to
get
all
the
letters
we
want
translated
well
pursued
corey
not
showing
his
discouragement
if
he
felt
any
i
know
the
countries
where
you
want
to
introduce
this
paint
of
yours
i
been
there
i
been
in
germany
and
france
and
i
been
in
south
america
and
mexico
i
been
in
italy
of
course
i
believe
i
could
go
to
any
of
those
countries
and
place
it
to
advantage
lapham
had
listened
with
a
trace
of
persuasion
in
his
face
but
now
he
shook
his
head
it
placing
itself
as
fast
as
there
any
call
for
it
it
pay
us
to
send
anybody
out
to
look
after
it
your
salary
and
expenses
would
eat
up
about
all
we
should
make
on
it
yes
returned
the
young
man
intrepidly
if
you
had
to
pay
me
any
salary
and
expenses
you
do
propose
to
work
for
nothing
i
propose
to
work
for
a
commission
the
colonel
was
beginning
to
shake
his
head
again
but
corey
hurried
on
i
have
come
to
you
without
making
some
inquiries
about
the
paint
and
i
know
how
it
stands
with
those
who
know
best
i
believe
in
it
lapham
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
young
man
deeply
moved
it
the
best
paint
in
god
universe
he
said
with
the
solemnity
of
prayer
it
the
best
in
the
market
said
corey
and
he
repeated
i
believe
in
it
you
believe
in
it
began
the
colonel
and
then
he
stopped
if
there
had
really
been
any
purchasing
power
in
money
a
year
income
would
have
bought
lapham
instant
presence
he
warmed
and
softened
to
the
young
man
in
every
way
not
only
because
he
must
do
so
to
any
one
who
believed
in
his
paint
but
because
he
had
done
this
innocent
person
the
wrong
of
listening
to
a
defamation
of
his
instinct
and
good
sense
and
had
been
willing
to
see
him
suffer
for
a
purely
supposititious
offence
corey
rose
you
must
let
me
outstay
my
twenty
minutes
he
said
taking
out
his
watch
i
do
expect
you
to
give
a
decided
answer
on
the
spot
all
that
i
ask
is
that
you
consider
my
proposition
do
hurry
said
lapham
sit
still
i
want
to
tell
you
about
this
paint
he
added
in
a
voice
husky
with
the
feeling
that
his
hearer
could
not
divine
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
it
i
could
walk
with
you
to
the
boat
suggested
the
young
man
never
mind
the
boat
i
can
take
the
next
one
look
here
the
colonel
pulled
open
a
drawer
as
corey
sat
down
again
and
took
out
a
photograph
of
the
locality
of
the
mine
here
where
we
get
it
this
photograph
do
half
do
the
place
justice
he
said
as
if
the
imperfect
art
had
slighted
the
features
of
a
beloved
face
it
one
of
the
sightliest
places
in
the
country
and
here
the
very
spot
he
covered
it
with
his
huge
forefinger
where
my
father
found
that
paint
more
than
forty
years
ago
yes
sir
he
went
on
and
told
the
story
in
unsparing
detail
while
his
chance
for
the
boat
passed
unheeded
and
the
clerks
in
the
outer
office
hung
up
their
linen
office
coats
and
put
on
their
seersucker
or
flannel
street
coats
the
young
lady
went
too
and
nobody
was
left
but
the
porter
who
made
from
time
to
time
a
noisy
demonstration
of
fastening
a
distant
blind
or
putting
something
in
place
at
last
the
colonel
roused
himself
from
the
autobiographical
delight
of
the
history
of
his
paint
well
sir
that
the
story
it
an
interesting
story
said
corey
with
a
long
breath
as
they
rose
together
and
lapham
put
on
his
coat
that
what
it
is
said
the
colonel
well
he
added
i
do
see
but
what
we
got
to
have
another
talk
about
this
thing
it
a
surprise
to
me
and
i
do
see
exactly
how
you
going
to
make
it
pay
i
willing
to
take
the
chances
answered
corey
as
i
said
i
believe
in
it
i
should
try
south
america
first
i
should
try
chili
look
here
said
lapham
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
i
like
to
get
things
over
we
just
got
time
for
the
six
boat
why
you
come
down
with
me
to
nantasket
i
can
give
you
a
bed
as
well
as
not
and
then
we
can
finish
up
the
impatience
of
youth
in
corey
responded
to
the
impatience
of
temperament
in
his
elder
why
i
do
see
why
i
should
he
allowed
himself
to
say
i
confess
i
should
like
to
have
it
finished
up
myself
if
it
could
be
finished
up
in
the
right
way
well
we
see
dennis
lapham
called
to
the
remote
porter
and
the
man
came
want
to
send
any
word
home
he
asked
corey
no
my
father
and
i
go
and
come
as
we
like
without
keeping
account
of
each
other
if
i
do
come
home
he
knows
that
i
not
there
all
well
that
convenient
you
find
you
ca
do
that
when
married
never
mind
dennis
said
the
colonel
he
had
time
to
buy
two
newspapers
on
the
wharf
before
he
jumped
on
board
the
with
corey
just
made
it
he
said
and
what
i
like
to
do
i
ca
stand
it
to
be
aboard
much
more
than
a
minute
before
she
shoves
out
he
gave
one
of
the
newspapers
to
corey
as
he
spoke
and
set
him
the
example
of
catching
up
a
on
their
way
to
that
point
on
the
boat
which
his
experience
had
taught
him
was
the
best
he
opened
his
paper
at
once
and
began
to
run
over
its
news
while
the
young
man
watched
the
spectacular
recession
of
the
city
and
was
vaguely
conscious
of
the
people
about
him
and
of
the
gay
life
of
the
water
round
the
boat
the
air
freshened
the
craft
thinned
in
number
they
met
larger
sail
lagging
slowly
inward
in
the
afternoon
light
the
islands
of
the
bay
waxed
and
waned
as
the
steamer
approached
and
left
them
behind
i
hate
to
see
them
stirring
up
those
southern
fellows
again
said
the
colonel
speaking
into
the
paper
on
his
lap
seems
to
me
it
time
to
let
those
old
issues
go
yes
said
the
young
man
what
are
they
doing
now
oh
stirring
up
the
confederate
brigadiers
in
congress
i
do
like
it
seems
to
me
if
our
party
hai
got
any
other
we
better
shut
up
shop
altogether
lapham
went
on
as
he
scanned
his
newspaper
to
give
his
ideas
of
public
questions
in
a
fragmentary
way
while
corey
listened
patiently
and
waited
for
him
to
come
back
to
business
he
folded
up
his
paper
at
last
and
stuffed
it
into
his
coat
pocket
there
one
thing
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
do
he
said
and
that
is
to
give
my
mind
a
complete
rest
from
business
while
going
down
on
the
boat
i
like
to
get
the
fresh
air
all
through
me
soul
and
body
i
believe
a
man
can
give
his
mind
a
rest
just
the
same
as
he
can
give
his
legs
a
rest
or
his
back
all
he
got
to
do
is
to
use
his
why
i
suppose
if
i
had
adopted
some
such
rule
with
the
strain
i
had
on
me
for
the
last
ten
years
i
should
been
a
dead
man
long
ago
that
the
reason
i
like
a
horse
got
to
give
your
mind
to
the
horse
you
ca
help
it
unless
you
want
to
break
your
neck
but
a
boat
different
and
there
you
got
to
use
your
you
got
to
take
your
mind
right
up
and
put
it
where
you
want
it
i
make
it
a
rule
to
read
the
paper
on
the
boat
hold
on
he
interrupted
himself
to
prevent
corey
from
paying
his
fare
to
the
man
who
had
come
round
for
it
i
got
tickets
and
when
i
get
through
the
paper
i
try
to
get
somebody
to
talk
to
or
i
watch
the
people
it
an
astonishing
thing
to
me
where
they
all
come
from
i
been
riding
up
and
down
on
these
boats
for
six
or
seven
years
and
i
do
know
but
very
few
of
the
faces
i
see
on
board
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
fresh
lot
every
time
well
of
course
town
full
of
strangers
in
the
summer
season
anyway
and
folks
keep
coming
down
from
the
country
they
think
it
a
great
thing
to
get
down
to
the
beach
and
they
all
heard
of
the
electric
light
on
the
water
and
they
want
to
see
it
but
you
take
faces
now
the
astonishing
thing
to
me
is
not
what
a
face
tells
but
what
it
do
tell
when
you
think
of
what
a
man
is
or
a
woman
is
and
what
most
of
have
been
through
before
they
get
to
be
thirty
it
seems
as
if
their
experience
would
burn
right
through
but
it
do
i
like
to
watch
the
couples
and
try
to
make
out
which
are
engaged
or
going
to
be
and
which
are
married
or
better
be
but
half
the
time
i
ca
make
any
sort
of
guess
of
course
where
they
young
and
kittenish
you
can
tell
but
where
anyways
on
you
ca
heigh
yes
i
think
you
right
said
corey
not
perfectly
reconciled
to
philosophy
in
the
place
of
business
but
accepting
it
as
he
must
well
said
the
colonel
i
do
suppose
it
was
meant
we
should
know
what
was
in
each
other
minds
it
would
take
a
man
out
of
his
own
hands
as
long
as
he
in
his
own
hands
there
some
hopes
of
his
doing
something
with
himself
but
if
a
fellow
has
been
found
out
even
if
he
has
been
found
out
to
be
so
very
bad
it
pretty
much
all
up
with
him
no
sir
i
do
want
to
know
people
through
and
through
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
on
board
and
of
course
the
boat
was
crowded
looked
as
if
they
might
not
only
be
easily
but
safely
known
there
was
little
style
and
no
distinction
among
them
they
were
people
who
were
going
down
to
the
beach
for
the
fun
or
the
relief
of
it
and
were
able
to
afford
it
in
face
they
were
commonplace
with
nothing
but
the
american
poetry
of
vivid
purpose
to
light
them
up
where
they
did
not
wholly
lack
fire
but
they
were
nearly
all
shrewd
and
with
an
apparent
readiness
for
the
humorous
intimacy
native
to
us
all
the
women
were
dandified
in
dress
according
to
their
means
and
taste
and
the
men
differed
from
each
other
in
degrees
of
indifference
to
it
to
a
population
such
as
ours
is
in
summer
no
sort
of
personal
dignity
is
possible
we
have
not
even
the
power
over
observers
which
comes
from
the
fantasticality
of
an
englishman
when
he
discards
the
conventional
dress
in
our
straw
hats
and
our
serge
or
flannel
sacks
we
are
no
more
imposing
than
a
crowd
of
boys
some
day
said
lapham
rising
as
the
boat
drew
near
the
wharf
of
the
final
landing
there
going
to
be
an
awful
accident
on
these
boats
just
look
at
that
jam
he
meant
the
people
thickly
packed
on
the
pier
and
under
strong
restraint
of
locks
and
gates
to
prevent
them
from
rushing
on
board
the
boat
and
possessing
her
for
the
return
trip
before
she
had
landed
her
nantasket
passengers
overload
every
time
he
continued
with
a
sort
of
dry
impersonal
concern
at
the
impending
calamity
as
if
it
could
not
possibly
include
him
they
take
about
twice
as
many
as
they
ought
to
carry
and
about
ten
times
as
many
as
they
could
save
if
anything
happened
yes
sir
it
bound
to
come
hello
there
my
girl
he
took
out
his
folded
newspaper
and
waved
it
toward
a
group
of
phaetons
and
barouches
drawn
up
on
the
pier
a
little
apart
from
the
pack
of
people
and
a
lady
in
one
of
them
answered
with
a
flourish
of
her
parasol
when
he
had
made
his
way
with
his
guest
through
the
crowd
she
began
to
speak
to
her
father
before
she
noticed
corey
well
colonel
improved
your
last
chance
we
been
coming
to
every
boat
since
four
or
jerry
has
and
i
told
mother
that
i
would
come
myself
once
and
see
if
i
could
fetch
you
and
if
i
failed
you
could
walk
next
time
you
getting
perfectly
spoiled
the
colonel
enjoyed
letting
her
scold
him
to
the
end
before
he
said
with
a
twinkle
of
pride
in
his
guest
and
satisfaction
in
her
probably
being
able
to
hold
her
own
against
any
discomfiture
i
brought
corey
down
for
the
night
with
me
and
i
was
showing
him
things
all
the
way
and
it
took
time
the
young
fellow
was
at
the
side
of
the
open
making
a
quick
bow
and
penelope
lapham
was
cozily
drawling
oh
how
do
you
do
mr
corey
before
the
colonel
had
finished
his
explanation
get
right
in
there
alongside
of
miss
lapham
corey
he
said
pulling
himself
up
into
the
place
beside
the
driver
no
no
he
had
added
quickly
at
some
signs
of
polite
protest
in
the
young
man
i
do
give
up
the
best
place
to
anybody
jerry
suppose
you
let
me
have
hold
of
the
leathers
a
minute
this
was
his
way
of
taking
the
reins
from
the
driver
and
in
half
the
time
he
specified
he
had
skilfully
turned
the
vehicle
on
the
pier
among
the
crooked
lines
and
groups
of
and
was
spinning
up
the
road
toward
the
stretch
of
verandaed
hotels
and
restaurants
in
the
sand
along
the
shore
pretty
gay
down
here
he
said
indicating
all
this
with
a
turn
of
his
whip
as
he
left
it
behind
him
but
got
about
sick
of
hotels
and
this
summer
i
made
up
my
mind
that
take
a
cottage
well
pen
how
are
the
folks
he
looked
round
for
her
answer
and
with
the
eye
thus
brought
to
bear
upon
her
he
was
able
to
give
her
a
wink
of
supreme
content
the
colonel
with
no
sort
of
ulterior
design
and
nothing
but
his
triumph
over
lapham
definitely
in
his
mind
was
feeling
as
he
would
have
said
about
right
the
girl
smiled
a
daughter
amusement
at
her
father
boyishness
i
do
think
there
much
change
since
morning
did
irene
have
a
headache
when
you
left
no
said
the
colonel
well
then
there
that
to
report
pshaw
said
the
colonel
with
vexation
in
his
tone
i
sorry
miss
irene
is
well
said
corey
politely
i
think
she
must
have
got
it
from
walking
too
long
on
the
beach
the
air
is
so
cool
here
that
you
forget
how
hot
the
sun
is
yes
that
true
assented
corey
a
good
night
rest
will
make
it
all
right
suggested
the
colonel
without
looking
round
but
you
girls
have
got
to
look
out
if
you
fond
of
walking
said
corey
i
suppose
you
find
the
beach
a
temptation
oh
it
is
so
much
that
returned
the
girl
you
keep
walking
on
and
on
because
it
so
smooth
and
straight
before
you
we
been
here
so
often
that
we
know
it
all
by
heart
just
how
it
looks
at
high
tide
and
how
it
looks
at
low
tide
and
how
it
looks
after
a
storm
we
as
well
acquainted
with
the
crabs
and
stranded
as
we
are
with
the
children
digging
in
the
sand
and
the
people
sitting
under
umbrellas
i
think
they
always
the
same
all
of
them
the
colonel
left
the
talk
to
the
young
people
when
he
spoke
next
it
was
to
say
well
here
we
are
and
he
turned
from
the
highway
and
drove
up
in
front
of
a
brown
cottage
with
a
vermilion
roof
and
a
group
of
geraniums
clutching
the
rock
that
cropped
up
in
the
loop
formed
by
the
road
it
was
treeless
and
bare
all
round
and
the
ocean
unnecessarily
vast
weltered
away
a
little
more
than
a
from
the
cottage
a
hospitable
smell
of
supper
filled
the
air
and
lapham
was
on
the
veranda
with
that
demand
in
her
eyes
for
her
belated
husband
excuses
which
she
was
obliged
to
check
on
her
tongue
at
sight
of
corey
vii
the
exultant
colonel
swung
himself
lightly
down
from
his
seat
brought
corey
with
me
he
nonchalantly
explained
lapham
made
their
guest
welcome
and
the
colonel
showed
him
to
his
room
briefly
assuring
himself
that
there
was
nothing
wanting
there
then
he
went
to
wash
his
own
hands
carelessly
ignoring
the
eagerness
with
which
his
wife
pursued
him
to
their
chamber
what
gave
irene
a
headache
he
asked
making
himself
a
fine
lather
for
his
hairy
paws
never
you
mind
irene
promptly
retorted
his
wife
how
came
he
to
come
did
you
press
him
if
you
did
i
never
forgive
you
silas
the
colonel
laughed
and
his
wife
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
to
make
him
laugh
lower
she
whispered
do
you
want
him
to
hear
every
thing
did
you
urge
him
the
colonel
laughed
the
more
he
was
going
to
get
all
the
good
out
of
this
no
i
did
urge
him
seemed
to
want
to
come
i
do
believe
it
where
did
you
meet
him
at
the
office
what
office
mine
nonsense
what
was
he
doing
there
oh
nothing
much
what
did
he
come
for
come
for
oh
he
said
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
mineral
paint
business
lapham
dropped
into
a
chair
and
watched
his
bulk
shaken
with
smothered
laughter
silas
lapham
she
gasped
if
you
try
to
get
off
any
more
of
those
things
on
me
the
colonel
applied
himself
to
the
towel
had
a
notion
he
could
work
it
in
south
america
i
do
know
what
he
up
to
never
mind
cried
his
wife
i
get
even
with
you
yet
so
i
told
him
he
had
better
come
down
and
talk
it
over
continued
the
colonel
in
simplicity
i
knew
he
would
touch
it
with
a
pole
go
on
threatened
lapham
right
thing
to
do
it
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
and
lapham
answered
it
a
maid
announced
supper
very
well
she
said
come
to
tea
now
but
make
you
pay
for
this
silas
penelope
had
gone
to
her
sister
room
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
house
is
your
head
any
better
she
asked
yes
a
little
came
a
voice
from
the
pillows
but
i
shall
not
come
to
tea
i
do
want
anything
if
i
keep
still
i
shall
be
all
right
by
morning
well
i
sorry
said
the
elder
sister
he
come
down
with
father
he
has
who
cried
irene
starting
up
in
simultaneous
denial
and
demand
oh
well
if
you
say
he
has
what
the
use
of
my
telling
you
who
oh
how
can
you
treat
me
so
moaned
the
sufferer
what
do
you
mean
pen
i
guess
i
better
not
tell
you
said
penelope
watching
her
like
a
cat
playing
with
a
mouse
if
you
not
coming
to
tea
it
would
just
excite
you
for
nothing
the
mouse
moaned
and
writhed
upon
the
bed
oh
i
would
treat
you
so
the
cat
seated
herself
across
the
room
and
asked
quietly
well
what
could
you
do
if
it
was
corey
you
could
come
to
tea
you
say
but
he
excuse
you
i
told
him
you
had
a
headache
why
of
course
you
ca
come
it
would
be
too
barefaced
but
you
need
be
troubled
irene
i
do
my
best
to
make
the
time
pass
pleasantly
for
him
here
the
cat
gave
a
low
titter
and
the
mouse
girded
itself
up
with
a
momentary
courage
and
i
should
think
you
would
be
ashamed
to
come
here
and
tease
me
so
i
do
see
why
you
should
believe
me
argued
penelope
why
should
he
come
down
with
father
if
father
asked
him
and
he
be
sure
to
if
he
thought
of
it
i
do
see
any
about
that
frog
that
any
better
than
any
other
frog
the
sense
of
her
sister
helplessness
was
too
much
for
the
tease
she
broke
down
in
a
fit
of
smothered
laughter
which
convinced
her
victim
that
it
was
nothing
but
an
joke
well
pen
i
would
use
you
so
she
whimpered
penelope
threw
herself
on
the
bed
beside
her
oh
poor
irene
he
is
here
it
a
solemn
fact
and
she
caressed
and
soothed
her
sister
while
she
choked
with
laughter
you
must
get
up
and
come
out
i
do
know
what
brought
him
here
but
here
he
is
it
too
late
now
said
irene
desolately
then
she
added
with
a
wilder
despair
what
a
fool
i
was
to
take
that
walk
well
coaxed
her
sister
come
out
and
get
some
tea
the
tea
will
do
you
good
no
no
i
ca
come
but
send
me
a
cup
here
yes
and
then
perhaps
you
can
see
him
later
in
the
evening
i
shall
not
see
him
at
all
an
hour
after
penelope
came
back
to
her
sister
room
and
found
her
before
her
glass
you
might
as
well
have
kept
still
and
been
well
by
morning
she
said
as
soon
as
we
were
done
father
said
corey
and
i
have
got
to
talk
over
a
little
matter
of
business
and
we
excuse
you
ladies
he
looked
at
mother
in
a
way
that
i
guess
was
pretty
hard
to
bear
you
ought
to
have
heard
the
colonel
swelling
at
supper
it
would
have
made
you
feel
that
all
he
said
the
other
day
was
nothing
lapham
suddenly
opened
the
door
now
see
here
pen
she
said
as
she
closed
it
behind
her
i
had
just
as
much
as
i
can
stand
from
your
father
and
if
you
do
tell
me
this
instant
what
it
all
means
she
left
the
consequences
to
imagination
and
penelope
replied
with
her
mock
soberness
well
the
colonel
does
seem
to
be
on
his
high
horse
but
you
must
ask
me
what
his
business
with
corey
is
for
i
do
know
all
that
i
know
is
that
i
met
them
at
the
landing
and
that
they
conversed
all
the
way
down
on
literary
topics
nonsense
what
do
you
think
it
is
well
if
you
want
my
candid
opinion
i
think
this
talk
about
business
is
nothing
but
a
blind
it
seems
a
pity
irene
should
have
been
up
to
receive
him
she
added
irene
cast
a
mute
look
of
imploring
at
her
mother
who
was
too
much
preoccupied
to
afford
her
the
protection
it
asked
your
father
said
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
business
with
him
irene
look
changed
to
a
stare
of
astonishment
and
mystification
but
penelope
preserved
her
imperturbability
well
it
a
lucrative
business
i
believe
well
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
cried
lapham
and
so
i
told
your
father
did
it
seem
to
convince
him
inquired
penelope
her
mother
did
not
reply
i
know
one
thing
she
said
he
got
to
tell
me
every
word
or
there
be
no
sleep
for
him
this
night
well
said
penelope
breaking
down
in
one
of
her
queer
laughs
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
you
were
right
go
on
and
dress
irene
ordered
her
mother
and
then
you
and
pen
come
out
into
the
parlour
they
can
have
just
two
hours
for
business
and
then
we
must
all
be
there
to
receive
him
you
have
got
headache
enough
to
hurt
you
oh
it
all
gone
now
said
the
girl
at
the
end
of
the
limit
she
had
given
the
colonel
lapham
looked
into
the
which
she
found
blue
with
his
smoke
i
think
you
gentlemen
will
find
the
parlour
pleasanter
now
and
we
can
give
it
up
to
you
oh
no
you
need
said
her
husband
we
got
about
through
corey
was
already
standing
and
lapham
rose
too
i
guess
we
can
join
the
ladies
now
we
can
leave
that
little
point
till
both
of
the
young
ladies
were
in
the
parlour
when
corey
entered
with
their
father
and
both
were
frankly
indifferent
to
the
few
books
and
the
many
newspapers
scattered
about
on
the
table
where
the
large
lamp
was
placed
but
after
corey
had
greeted
irene
he
glanced
at
the
novel
under
his
eye
and
said
in
the
dearth
that
sometimes
befalls
people
at
such
times
i
see
you
reading
middlemarch
do
you
like
george
eliot
who
asked
the
girl
penelope
interposed
i
do
believe
irene
read
it
yet
i
just
got
it
out
of
the
library
i
heard
so
much
talk
about
it
i
wish
she
would
let
you
find
out
a
little
about
the
people
for
yourself
she
added
but
here
her
father
struck
in
i
ca
get
the
time
for
books
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
up
with
the
newspapers
and
when
night
comes
i
tired
and
i
rather
go
out
to
the
theatre
or
a
lecture
if
they
got
a
good
stereopticon
to
give
you
views
of
the
places
but
i
guess
we
all
like
a
play
better
than
anything
else
i
want
something
that
make
me
laugh
i
do
believe
in
tragedy
i
think
there
enough
of
that
in
real
life
without
putting
it
on
the
stage
seen
whitcomb
the
whole
family
joined
in
the
discussion
and
it
appeared
that
they
all
had
their
opinions
of
the
plays
and
actors
lapham
brought
the
talk
back
to
literature
i
guess
penelope
does
most
of
our
reading
now
mother
you
not
going
to
put
it
all
on
me
said
the
girl
in
comic
protest
her
mother
laughed
and
then
added
with
a
sigh
i
used
to
like
to
get
hold
of
a
good
book
when
i
was
a
girl
but
we
were
allowed
to
read
many
novels
in
those
days
my
mother
called
them
all
lies
and
i
guess
she
was
so
very
far
wrong
about
some
of
them
they
certainly
fictions
said
corey
smiling
well
we
do
buy
a
good
many
books
first
and
last
said
the
colonel
who
probably
had
in
mind
the
costly
volumes
which
they
presented
to
one
another
on
birthdays
and
holidays
but
i
get
about
all
the
reading
i
want
in
the
newspapers
and
when
the
girls
want
a
novel
i
tell
to
get
it
out
of
the
library
that
what
the
library
for
phew
he
panted
blowing
away
the
whole
unprofitable
subject
how
close
you
like
to
keep
a
room
you
go
down
to
the
or
up
to
the
mountains
for
a
change
of
air
and
then
you
cork
yourselves
into
a
room
so
tight
you
do
have
any
air
at
all
here
you
girls
get
on
your
bonnets
and
go
and
show
corey
the
view
of
the
hotels
from
the
rocks
corey
said
that
he
should
be
delighted
the
girls
exchanged
looks
with
each
other
and
then
with
their
mother
irene
curved
her
pretty
chin
in
comment
upon
her
father
incorrigibility
and
penelope
made
a
droll
mouth
but
the
colonel
remained
serenely
content
with
his
finesse
i
got
out
of
the
way
he
said
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
and
before
his
wife
had
time
to
fall
upon
him
because
i
got
through
my
talk
with
him
and
now
i
want
to
talk
with
you
it
just
as
i
said
persis
he
wants
to
go
into
the
business
with
me
it
lucky
for
you
said
his
wife
meaning
that
now
he
would
not
be
made
to
suffer
for
attempting
to
hoax
her
but
she
was
too
intensely
interested
to
pursue
that
matter
further
what
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
he
means
by
it
well
i
should
judge
by
his
talk
that
he
had
been
trying
a
good
many
different
things
since
he
left
college
and
he
hai
found
just
the
thing
he
likes
or
the
thing
that
likes
him
it
ai
so
easy
and
now
he
got
an
idea
that
he
can
take
hold
of
the
paint
and
push
it
in
other
countries
push
it
in
mexico
and
push
it
in
south
america
a
splendid
spanish
scholar
this
was
lapham
version
of
modest
claim
to
a
smattering
of
the
language
and
he
been
among
the
natives
enough
to
know
their
ways
and
he
believes
in
the
paint
added
the
colonel
i
guess
he
believes
in
something
else
besides
the
paint
said
lapham
what
do
you
mean
well
silas
lapham
if
you
ca
see
now
that
he
after
irene
i
do
know
what
ever
can
open
your
eyes
that
all
the
colonel
pretended
to
give
the
idea
silent
consideration
as
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
well
then
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
he
going
a
good
way
round
i
do
say
you
wrong
but
if
it
irene
i
do
see
why
he
should
want
to
go
off
to
south
america
to
get
her
and
that
what
he
proposes
to
do
i
guess
there
some
paint
about
it
too
persis
he
says
he
believes
in
it
the
colonel
devoutly
lowered
his
voice
and
he
willing
to
take
the
agency
on
his
own
account
down
there
and
run
it
for
a
commission
on
what
he
can
sell
of
course
he
is
going
to
take
hold
of
it
any
way
so
as
to
feel
beholden
to
you
he
got
too
much
pride
for
that
he
ai
going
to
take
hold
of
it
at
all
if
he
do
mean
paint
in
the
first
place
and
irene
afterward
i
do
object
to
him
as
i
know
either
way
but
the
two
things
wo
mix
and
i
do
propose
he
shall
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
or
anybody
else
but
as
far
as
heard
from
up
to
date
he
means
paint
first
last
and
all
the
time
at
any
rate
i
going
to
take
him
on
that
basis
he
got
some
pretty
good
ideas
about
it
and
he
been
stirred
up
by
this
talk
just
now
about
getting
our
manufactures
into
the
foreign
markets
there
an
overstock
in
everything
and
we
got
to
get
rid
of
it
or
we
got
to
shut
down
till
the
home
demand
begins
again
we
had
two
or
three
such
flurries
before
now
and
they
did
amount
to
much
they
say
we
ca
extend
our
commerce
under
the
high
tariff
system
we
got
now
because
there
ai
any
sort
of
reciprocity
on
our
side
we
want
to
have
the
other
fellows
show
all
the
reciprocity
and
the
english
have
got
the
advantage
of
us
every
time
i
do
know
whether
it
so
or
not
but
i
do
see
why
it
should
apply
to
my
paint
anyway
he
wants
to
try
it
and
i
about
made
up
my
mind
to
let
him
of
course
i
ai
going
to
let
him
take
all
the
risk
i
believe
in
the
paint
too
and
i
shall
pay
his
expenses
anyway
so
you
want
another
partner
after
all
lapham
could
not
forbear
saying
yes
if
that
your
idea
of
a
partner
it
is
mine
returned
her
husband
dryly
well
if
you
made
up
your
mind
si
i
suppose
you
ready
for
advice
said
lapham
the
colonel
enjoyed
this
yes
i
am
what
have
you
got
to
say
against
it
i
do
know
as
i
got
anything
i
satisfied
if
you
are
well
when
is
he
going
to
start
for
south
america
i
shall
take
him
into
the
office
a
while
he
get
off
some
time
in
the
winter
but
he
got
to
know
the
business
first
oh
indeed
are
you
going
to
take
him
to
board
in
the
family
what
are
you
after
persis
oh
nothing
i
presume
he
will
feel
free
to
visit
in
the
family
even
if
he
do
board
with
us
i
presume
he
will
and
if
he
do
use
his
privileges
do
you
think
he
be
a
fit
person
to
manage
your
paint
in
south
america
the
colonel
reddened
consciously
i
not
taking
him
on
that
basis
oh
yes
you
are
you
may
pretend
you
ai
to
yourself
but
you
must
pretend
so
to
me
because
i
know
you
the
colonel
laughed
pshaw
he
said
lapham
continued
i
do
see
any
harm
in
hoping
that
he
take
a
fancy
to
her
but
if
you
really
think
it
wo
do
to
mix
the
two
things
i
advise
you
not
to
take
corey
into
the
business
it
will
do
all
very
well
if
he
does
take
a
fancy
to
her
but
if
he
do
you
know
how
you
feel
about
it
and
i
know
you
well
enough
silas
to
know
that
you
ca
do
him
justice
if
that
happens
and
i
do
think
it
right
you
should
take
this
step
unless
you
pretty
sure
i
can
see
that
you
set
your
heart
on
this
thing
i
have
set
my
heart
on
it
at
all
protested
lapham
and
if
you
ca
bring
it
about
you
going
to
feel
unhappy
over
it
pursued
his
wife
regardless
of
his
protest
oh
very
well
he
said
if
you
know
more
about
what
in
my
mind
than
i
do
there
no
use
arguing
as
i
can
see
he
got
up
to
carry
off
his
consciousness
and
sauntered
out
of
the
door
on
to
his
piazza
he
could
see
the
young
people
down
on
the
rocks
and
his
heart
swelled
in
his
breast
he
had
always
said
that
he
did
not
care
what
a
man
family
was
but
the
presence
of
young
corey
as
an
applicant
to
him
for
employment
as
his
guest
as
the
possible
suitor
of
his
daughter
was
one
of
the
sweetest
flavours
that
he
had
yet
tasted
in
his
success
he
knew
who
the
coreys
were
very
well
and
in
his
simple
brutal
way
he
had
long
hated
their
name
as
a
symbol
of
splendour
which
unless
he
should
live
to
see
at
least
three
generations
of
his
descendants
gilded
with
mineral
paint
he
could
not
hope
to
realise
in
his
own
he
was
acquainted
in
a
business
way
with
the
tradition
of
old
phillips
corey
and
he
had
heard
a
great
many
things
about
the
corey
who
had
spent
his
youth
abroad
and
his
money
everywhere
and
done
nothing
but
say
smart
things
lapham
could
not
see
the
smartness
of
some
of
them
which
had
been
repeated
to
him
once
he
had
encountered
the
fellow
and
it
seemed
to
lapham
that
the
tall
slim
man
with
the
slight
stoop
was
everything
that
was
offensively
aristocratic
he
had
bristled
up
aggressively
at
the
name
when
his
wife
told
how
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
fellow
family
the
summer
before
and
he
had
treated
the
notion
of
young
corey
caring
for
irene
with
the
contempt
which
such
a
ridiculous
superstition
deserved
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
young
corey
beforehand
yet
when
he
met
him
he
felt
an
instant
liking
for
him
which
he
frankly
acknowledged
and
he
had
begun
to
assume
the
burden
of
his
wife
superstition
of
which
she
seemed
now
ready
to
accuse
him
of
being
the
inventor
nothing
had
moved
his
thick
imagination
like
this
day
events
since
the
girl
who
taught
him
spelling
and
grammar
in
the
school
at
lumberville
had
said
she
would
have
him
for
her
husband
the
dark
figures
stationary
on
the
rocks
began
to
move
and
he
could
see
that
they
were
coming
toward
the
house
he
went
indoors
so
as
not
to
appear
to
have
been
watching
them
viii
a
week
after
she
had
parted
with
her
son
at
bar
harbour
corey
suddenly
walked
in
upon
her
husband
in
their
house
in
boston
he
was
at
breakfast
and
he
gave
her
the
patronising
welcome
with
which
the
husband
who
has
been
staying
in
town
all
summer
receives
his
wife
when
she
drops
down
upon
him
from
the
mountains
or
the
for
a
little
moment
she
feels
herself
strange
in
the
house
and
suffers
herself
to
be
treated
like
a
guest
before
envy
of
his
comfort
vexes
her
back
into
possession
and
authority
corey
was
a
lady
and
she
did
not
let
her
envy
take
the
form
of
open
reproach
well
anna
you
find
me
here
in
the
luxury
you
left
me
to
how
did
you
leave
the
girls
the
girls
were
well
said
corey
looking
absently
at
her
husband
brown
velvet
coat
in
which
he
was
so
handsome
no
man
had
ever
grown
grey
more
beautifully
his
hair
while
not
remaining
dark
enough
to
form
a
theatrical
contrast
with
his
moustache
was
yet
some
shades
darker
and
in
becoming
a
little
thinner
it
had
become
a
little
more
gracefully
wavy
his
skin
had
the
pearly
tint
which
that
of
elderly
men
sometimes
assumes
and
the
lines
which
time
had
traced
upon
it
were
too
delicate
for
the
name
of
wrinkles
he
had
never
had
any
personal
vanity
and
there
was
no
consciousness
in
his
good
looks
now
i
am
glad
of
that
the
boy
i
have
with
me
he
returned
that
is
when
he
is
with
me
why
where
is
he
demanded
the
mother
probably
carousing
with
the
boon
lapham
somewhere
he
left
me
yesterday
afternoon
to
go
and
offer
his
allegiance
to
the
mineral
paint
king
and
i
have
seen
him
since
bromfield
cried
corey
why
did
you
stop
him
well
my
dear
i
not
sure
that
it
is
a
very
good
thing
a
good
thing
it
horrid
no
i
do
think
so
it
decent
tom
had
found
out
without
consulting
the
landscape
which
i
believe
proclaims
it
everywhere
hideous
that
it
really
a
good
thing
and
he
thinks
that
he
has
some
ideas
in
regard
to
its
dissemination
in
the
parts
beyond
seas
why
should
he
go
into
something
else
lamented
the
mother
i
believe
he
has
gone
into
nearly
everything
else
and
come
out
of
it
so
there
is
a
chance
of
his
coming
out
of
this
but
as
i
had
nothing
to
suggest
in
place
of
it
i
thought
it
best
not
to
interfere
in
fact
what
good
would
my
telling
him
that
mineral
paint
was
nasty
have
done
i
dare
say
you
told
him
it
was
nasty
yes
i
did
and
you
see
with
what
effect
though
he
values
your
opinion
three
times
as
much
as
he
values
mine
perhaps
you
came
up
to
tell
him
again
that
it
was
nasty
i
feel
very
unhappy
about
it
he
is
throwing
himself
away
yes
i
should
like
to
prevent
it
if
i
could
the
father
shook
his
head
if
lapham
has
prevented
it
i
fancy
it
too
late
but
there
may
be
some
hopes
of
lapham
as
for
tom
throwing
himself
away
i
know
there
no
question
but
he
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
under
the
sun
he
tremendously
energetic
and
he
has
plenty
of
the
kind
of
sense
which
we
call
horse
but
he
is
brilliant
no
tom
is
not
brilliant
i
do
think
he
would
get
on
in
a
profession
and
instinctively
kept
out
of
everything
of
the
kind
but
he
has
got
to
do
something
what
shall
he
do
he
says
mineral
paint
and
really
i
see
why
he
should
if
money
is
fairly
and
honestly
earned
why
should
we
pretend
to
care
what
it
comes
out
of
when
we
do
really
care
that
superstition
is
exploded
everywhere
oh
it
is
the
paint
alone
said
corey
and
then
she
perceptibly
arrested
herself
and
made
a
diversion
in
continuing
i
wish
he
had
married
some
one
with
money
suggested
her
husband
from
time
to
time
i
have
attempted
tom
corruption
from
that
side
but
i
suspect
tom
has
a
conscience
against
it
and
i
rather
like
him
for
it
i
married
for
love
myself
said
corey
looking
across
the
table
at
his
wife
she
returned
his
look
tolerantly
though
she
felt
it
right
to
say
what
nonsense
besides
continued
her
husband
if
you
come
to
money
there
is
the
paint
princess
she
will
have
plenty
ah
that
the
worst
of
it
sighed
the
mother
i
suppose
i
could
get
on
with
the
paint
but
not
with
the
princess
i
thought
you
said
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
she
is
very
pretty
and
she
is
but
there
is
nothing
of
her
she
is
insipid
she
is
very
insipid
but
tom
seemed
to
like
her
flavour
such
as
it
was
how
can
i
tell
we
were
under
a
terrible
obligation
to
them
and
i
naturally
wished
him
to
be
polite
to
them
in
fact
i
asked
him
to
be
so
and
he
was
too
polite
i
ca
say
that
he
was
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
child
is
extremely
pretty
tom
says
there
are
two
of
them
perhaps
they
will
neutralise
each
other
yes
there
is
another
daughter
assented
corey
i
do
see
how
you
can
joke
about
such
things
bromfield
she
added
well
i
do
either
my
dear
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
hardihood
surprises
me
here
is
a
son
of
mine
whom
i
see
reduced
to
making
his
living
by
a
shrinkage
in
values
it
very
odd
interjected
corey
that
some
values
should
have
this
peculiarity
of
shrinking
you
never
hear
of
values
in
a
picture
shrinking
but
rents
stocks
real
estate
all
those
values
shrink
abominably
perhaps
it
might
be
argued
that
one
should
put
all
his
values
into
pictures
i
got
a
good
many
of
mine
there
tom
need
earn
his
living
said
corey
refusing
her
jest
there
still
enough
for
all
of
us
that
is
what
i
have
sometimes
urged
upon
tom
i
have
proved
to
him
that
with
economy
and
strict
attention
to
business
he
need
do
nothing
as
long
as
he
lives
of
course
he
would
be
somewhat
restricted
and
it
would
cramp
the
rest
of
us
but
it
is
a
world
of
sacrifices
and
compromises
he
could
agree
with
me
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
moved
by
the
example
of
persons
of
quality
in
europe
which
i
alleged
in
support
of
the
life
of
idleness
it
appears
that
he
wishes
to
do
something
to
do
something
for
himself
i
am
afraid
that
tom
is
selfish
corey
smiled
wanly
thirty
years
before
she
had
married
the
rich
young
painter
in
rome
who
said
so
much
better
things
than
he
painted
charming
things
just
the
things
to
please
the
fancy
of
a
girl
who
was
disposed
to
take
life
a
little
too
seriously
and
practically
she
saw
him
in
a
different
light
when
she
got
him
home
to
boston
but
he
had
kept
on
saying
the
charming
things
and
he
had
not
done
much
else
in
fact
he
had
fulfilled
the
promise
of
his
youth
it
was
a
good
trait
in
him
that
he
was
not
actively
but
only
passively
extravagant
he
was
not
adventurous
with
his
money
his
tastes
were
as
simple
as
an
italian
he
had
no
expensive
habits
in
the
process
of
time
he
had
grown
to
lead
a
more
and
more
secluded
life
it
was
hard
to
get
him
out
anywhere
even
to
dinner
his
patience
with
their
narrowing
circumstances
had
a
pathos
which
she
felt
the
more
the
more
she
came
into
charge
of
their
joint
life
at
times
it
seemed
too
bad
that
the
children
and
their
education
and
pleasures
should
cost
so
much
she
knew
besides
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
them
she
would
have
gone
back
to
rome
with
him
and
lived
princely
there
for
less
than
it
took
to
live
respectably
in
boston
tom
has
consulted
me
continued
his
father
but
he
has
consulted
other
people
and
he
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
mineral
paint
is
a
good
thing
to
go
into
he
has
found
out
all
about
it
and
about
its
founder
or
inventor
it
quite
impressive
to
hear
him
talk
and
if
he
must
do
something
for
himself
i
do
see
why
his
egotism
should
as
well
take
that
form
as
another
combined
with
the
paint
princess
it
is
so
agreeable
but
that
only
a
remote
possibility
for
which
your
principal
ground
is
your
motherly
solicitude
but
even
if
it
were
probable
and
imminent
what
could
you
do
the
chief
consolation
that
we
american
parents
have
in
these
matters
is
that
we
can
do
nothing
if
we
were
europeans
even
english
we
should
take
some
cognisance
of
our
children
love
affairs
and
in
some
measure
teach
their
young
affections
how
to
shoot
but
it
is
our
custom
to
ignore
them
until
they
have
shot
and
then
they
ignore
us
we
are
altogether
too
delicate
to
arrange
the
marriages
of
our
children
and
when
they
have
arranged
them
we
do
like
to
say
anything
for
fear
we
should
only
make
bad
worse
the
right
way
is
for
us
to
school
ourselves
to
indifference
that
is
what
the
young
people
have
to
do
elsewhere
and
that
is
the
only
logical
result
of
our
position
here
it
is
absurd
for
us
to
have
any
feeling
about
what
we
do
interfere
with
oh
people
do
interfere
with
their
children
marriages
very
often
said
corey
yes
but
only
in
a
way
so
as
not
to
make
it
disagreeable
for
themselves
if
the
marriages
go
on
in
spite
of
them
as
pretty
apt
to
do
now
my
idea
is
that
i
ought
to
cut
tom
off
with
a
shilling
that
would
be
very
simple
and
it
would
be
economical
but
you
would
never
consent
and
tom
would
mind
it
i
think
our
whole
conduct
in
regard
to
such
things
is
wrong
said
corey
oh
very
likely
but
our
whole
civilisation
is
based
upon
it
and
who
is
going
to
make
a
beginning
to
which
father
in
our
acquaintance
shall
i
go
and
propose
an
alliance
for
tom
with
his
daughter
i
should
feel
like
an
ass
and
will
you
go
to
some
mother
and
ask
her
sons
in
marriage
for
our
daughters
you
would
feel
like
a
goose
no
the
only
motto
for
us
is
hands
off
altogether
i
shall
certainly
speak
to
tom
when
the
time
comes
said
corey
and
i
shall
ask
leave
to
be
absent
from
your
discomfiture
my
dear
answered
her
husband
the
son
returned
that
afternoon
and
confessed
his
surprise
at
finding
his
mother
in
boston
he
was
so
frank
that
she
had
not
quite
the
courage
to
confess
in
turn
why
she
had
come
but
trumped
up
an
excuse
well
mother
he
said
promptly
i
have
made
an
engagement
with
mr
lapham
have
you
tom
she
asked
faintly
yes
for
the
present
i
am
going
to
have
charge
of
his
foreign
correspondence
and
if
i
see
my
way
to
the
advantage
i
expect
to
find
in
it
i
am
going
out
to
manage
that
side
of
his
business
in
south
america
and
mexico
he
behaved
very
handsomely
about
it
he
says
that
if
it
appears
for
our
common
interest
he
shall
pay
me
a
salary
as
well
as
a
commission
i
talked
with
uncle
jim
and
he
thinks
it
a
good
opening
your
uncle
jim
does
queried
corey
in
amaze
yes
i
consulted
him
the
whole
way
through
and
i
acted
on
his
advice
this
seemed
an
incomprehensible
treachery
on
her
brother
part
yes
i
thought
you
would
like
to
have
me
and
besides
i
possibly
have
gone
to
any
one
so
well
fitted
to
advise
me
his
mother
said
nothing
in
fact
the
mineral
paint
business
however
painful
its
interest
was
for
the
moment
superseded
by
a
more
poignant
anxiety
she
began
to
feel
her
way
cautiously
toward
this
have
you
been
talking
about
your
business
with
lapham
all
night
well
pretty
much
said
her
son
with
a
guiltless
laugh
i
went
to
see
him
yesterday
afternoon
after
i
had
gone
over
the
whole
ground
with
uncle
jim
and
lapham
asked
me
to
go
down
with
him
and
finish
up
down
repeated
corey
yes
to
nantasket
he
has
a
cottage
down
there
at
nantasket
corey
knitted
her
brows
a
little
what
in
the
world
can
a
cottage
at
nantasket
be
like
oh
very
much
like
a
anywhere
it
has
the
usual
allowance
of
red
roof
and
veranda
there
are
the
regulation
rocks
by
the
sea
and
the
big
hotels
on
the
beach
about
a
mile
off
flaring
away
with
electric
lights
and
at
night
we
did
have
them
at
nahant
no
said
his
mother
is
lapham
well
and
her
daughter
yes
i
think
so
said
the
young
man
the
young
ladies
walked
me
down
to
the
rocks
in
the
usual
way
after
dinner
and
then
i
came
back
and
talked
paint
with
lapham
till
midnight
we
did
settle
anything
till
this
morning
coming
up
on
the
boat
what
sort
of
people
do
they
seem
to
be
at
home
what
sort
well
i
do
know
that
i
noticed
corey
permitted
herself
the
first
part
of
a
sigh
of
relief
and
her
son
laughed
but
apparently
not
at
her
they
just
reading
middlemarch
they
say
there
so
much
talk
about
it
oh
i
suppose
they
very
good
people
they
seemed
to
be
on
very
good
terms
with
each
other
i
suppose
it
the
plain
sister
who
reading
middlemarch
plain
is
she
plain
asked
the
young
man
as
if
searching
his
consciousness
yes
it
the
older
one
who
does
the
reading
apparently
but
i
do
believe
that
even
she
overdoes
it
they
like
to
talk
better
they
reminded
me
of
southern
people
in
that
the
young
man
smiled
as
if
amused
by
some
of
his
impressions
of
the
lapham
family
the
living
as
the
country
people
call
it
is
tremendously
good
the
colonel
he
a
colonel
talked
of
the
coffee
as
his
coffee
as
if
she
had
personally
made
it
in
the
kitchen
though
i
believe
it
was
merely
inspired
by
her
and
there
was
everything
in
the
house
that
money
could
buy
but
money
has
its
limitations
this
was
a
fact
which
corey
was
beginning
to
realise
more
and
more
unpleasantly
in
her
own
life
but
it
seemed
to
bring
her
a
certain
comfort
in
its
application
to
the
laphams
yes
there
is
a
point
where
taste
has
to
begin
she
said
they
seemed
to
want
to
apologise
to
me
for
not
having
more
books
said
corey
i
do
know
why
they
should
the
colonel
said
they
bought
a
good
many
books
first
and
last
but
apparently
they
take
them
to
the
i
dare
say
they
never
buy
a
new
book
i
met
some
of
these
moneyed
people
lately
and
they
lavish
on
every
conceivable
luxury
and
then
borrow
books
and
get
them
in
the
cheap
paper
editions
i
fancy
that
the
way
with
the
lapham
family
said
the
young
man
smilingly
but
they
are
very
good
people
the
other
daughter
is
humorous
humorous
corey
knitted
her
brows
in
some
perplexity
do
you
mean
like
mrs
sayre
she
asked
naming
the
lady
whose
name
must
come
into
every
boston
mind
when
humour
is
mentioned
oh
no
nothing
like
that
she
never
says
anything
that
you
can
remember
nothing
in
flashes
or
ripples
nothing
the
least
literary
but
it
a
sort
of
droll
way
of
looking
at
things
or
a
droll
medium
through
which
things
present
themselves
i
do
know
she
tells
what
she
seen
and
mimics
a
little
oh
said
corey
coldly
after
a
moment
she
asked
and
is
miss
irene
as
pretty
as
ever
she
a
wonderful
complexion
said
the
son
unsatisfactorily
i
shall
want
to
be
by
when
father
and
colonel
lapham
meet
he
added
with
a
smile
ah
yes
your
father
said
the
mother
in
that
way
in
which
a
wife
at
once
compassionates
and
censures
her
husband
to
their
children
do
you
think
it
really
going
to
be
a
trial
to
him
asked
the
young
man
quickly
no
no
i
ca
say
it
is
but
i
confess
i
wish
it
was
some
other
business
tom
well
mother
i
do
see
why
the
principal
thing
looked
at
now
is
the
amount
of
money
and
while
i
would
rather
starve
than
touch
a
dollar
that
was
dirty
with
any
sort
of
dishonesty
of
course
you
would
my
son
interposed
his
mother
proudly
i
should
at
all
mind
its
having
a
little
mineral
paint
on
it
use
my
influence
with
colonel
lapham
if
i
ever
have
any
to
have
his
paint
scraped
off
the
landscape
i
suppose
you
wo
begin
till
the
autumn
oh
yes
i
shall
said
the
son
laughing
at
his
mother
simple
ignorance
of
business
i
shall
begin
morning
morning
yes
i
had
my
desk
appointed
already
and
i
shall
be
down
there
at
nine
in
the
morning
to
take
possession
tom
cried
his
mother
why
do
you
think
lapham
has
taken
you
into
business
so
readily
i
always
heard
that
it
was
so
hard
for
young
men
to
get
in
and
do
you
think
i
found
it
easy
with
him
we
had
about
twelve
solid
talk
and
you
do
suppose
it
was
any
sort
of
personal
consideration
why
i
do
know
exactly
what
you
mean
mother
i
suppose
he
likes
me
corey
could
not
say
just
what
she
meant
she
answered
ineffectually
enough
yes
you
would
like
it
to
be
a
favour
would
you
i
think
he
a
man
who
may
be
trusted
to
look
after
his
own
interest
but
i
do
mind
his
beginning
by
liking
me
it
be
my
own
fault
if
i
do
make
myself
essential
to
him
yes
said
corey
well
demanded
her
husband
at
their
first
meeting
after
her
interview
with
their
son
what
did
you
say
to
tom
very
little
if
anything
i
found
him
with
his
mind
made
up
and
it
would
only
have
distressed
him
if
i
had
tried
to
change
it
that
is
precisely
what
i
said
my
dear
besides
he
had
talked
the
matter
over
fully
with
james
and
seems
to
have
been
advised
by
him
i
ca
understand
james
oh
it
in
regard
to
the
paint
and
not
the
princess
that
he
made
up
his
mind
well
i
think
you
were
wise
to
let
him
alone
anna
we
represent
a
faded
tradition
we
do
really
care
what
business
a
man
is
in
so
it
is
large
enough
and
he
does
advertise
offensively
but
we
think
it
fine
to
affect
reluctance
do
you
really
feel
so
bromfield
asked
his
wife
seriously
certainly
i
do
there
was
a
long
time
in
my
misguided
youth
when
i
supposed
myself
some
sort
of
porcelain
but
it
a
relief
to
be
of
the
common
clay
after
all
and
to
know
it
if
i
get
broken
i
can
be
easily
replaced
if
tom
must
go
into
such
a
business
said
corey
i
glad
james
approves
of
it
i
afraid
it
would
matter
to
tom
if
he
did
and
i
do
know
that
i
should
care
said
corey
betraying
the
fact
that
he
had
perhaps
had
a
good
deal
of
his
judgment
in
the
course
of
his
life
you
had
better
consult
him
in
regard
to
tom
marrying
the
princess
there
is
no
necessity
at
present
for
that
said
corey
with
dignity
after
a
moment
she
asked
should
you
feel
quite
so
easy
if
it
were
a
question
of
that
bromfield
it
would
be
a
little
more
personal
you
feel
about
it
as
i
do
of
course
we
have
both
lived
too
long
and
seen
too
much
of
the
world
to
suppose
we
can
control
such
things
the
child
is
good
i
have
the
least
doubt
and
all
those
things
can
be
managed
so
that
they
would
disgrace
us
but
she
has
had
a
certain
sort
of
bringing
up
i
should
prefer
tom
to
marry
a
girl
with
another
sort
and
this
business
venture
of
his
increases
the
chances
that
he
wo
that
all
not
so
deep
as
a
well
nor
so
wide
as
a
church
door
but
serve
i
should
like
it
well
it
has
happened
yet
ah
you
never
can
realise
anything
beforehand
perhaps
that
has
saved
me
some
suffering
but
you
have
at
least
the
consolation
of
two
anxieties
at
once
i
always
find
that
a
great
advantage
you
can
play
one
off
against
the
other
corey
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
she
did
not
experience
the
suggested
consolation
and
she
arranged
to
quit
the
following
afternoon
the
scene
of
her
defeat
which
she
had
not
had
the
courage
to
make
a
battlefield
her
son
went
down
to
see
her
off
on
the
boat
after
spending
his
first
day
at
his
desk
in
lapham
office
he
was
in
a
gay
humour
and
she
departed
in
a
reflected
gleam
of
his
good
spirits
he
told
her
all
about
it
as
he
sat
talking
with
her
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
lingering
till
the
last
moment
and
then
stepping
ashore
with
as
little
waste
of
time
as
lapham
himself
on
the
which
the
had
laid
hold
of
he
touched
his
hat
to
her
from
the
wharf
to
reassure
her
of
his
escape
from
being
carried
away
with
her
and
the
next
moment
his
smiling
face
hid
itself
in
the
crowd
he
walked
on
smiling
up
the
long
wharf
encumbered
with
trucks
and
hacks
and
piles
of
freight
and
taking
his
way
through
the
deserted
business
streets
beyond
this
bustle
made
a
point
of
passing
the
door
of
lapham
warehouse
on
the
jambs
of
which
his
name
and
paint
were
lettered
in
black
on
a
square
ground
of
white
the
door
was
still
open
and
corey
loitered
a
moment
before
it
tempted
to
go
upstairs
and
fetch
away
some
foreign
letters
which
he
had
left
on
his
desk
and
which
he
thought
he
might
finish
up
at
home
he
was
in
love
with
his
work
and
he
felt
the
enthusiasm
for
it
which
nothing
but
the
work
we
can
do
well
inspires
in
us
he
believed
that
he
had
found
his
place
in
the
world
after
a
good
deal
of
looking
and
he
had
the
relief
the
repose
of
fitting
into
it
every
little
incident
of
the
momentous
uneventful
day
was
a
pleasure
in
his
mind
from
his
sitting
down
at
his
desk
to
which
lapham
boy
brought
him
the
foreign
letters
till
his
rising
from
it
an
hour
ago
lapham
had
been
in
view
within
his
own
office
but
he
had
given
corey
no
formal
reception
and
had
in
fact
not
spoken
to
him
till
toward
the
end
of
the
forenoon
when
he
suddenly
came
out
of
his
den
with
some
more
letters
in
his
hand
and
after
a
brief
how
d
do
had
spoken
a
few
words
about
them
and
left
them
with
him
he
was
in
his
again
and
his
sanguine
person
seemed
to
radiate
the
heat
with
which
he
suffered
he
did
not
go
out
to
lunch
but
had
it
brought
to
him
in
his
office
where
corey
saw
him
eating
it
before
he
left
his
own
desk
to
go
out
and
perch
on
a
swinging
seat
before
the
long
counter
of
a
restaurant
he
observed
that
all
the
others
lunched
at
twelve
and
he
resolved
to
anticipate
his
usual
hour
when
he
returned
the
pretty
girl
who
had
been
clicking
away
at
a
all
the
morning
was
neatly
putting
out
of
sight
the
evidences
of
pie
from
the
table
where
her
machine
stood
and
was
preparing
to
go
on
with
her
copying
in
his
office
lapham
lay
asleep
in
his
with
a
newspaper
over
his
face
now
while
corey
lingered
at
the
entrance
to
the
stairway
these
two
came
down
the
stairs
together
and
he
heard
lapham
saying
well
then
you
better
get
a
divorce
he
looked
red
and
excited
and
the
girl
face
which
she
veiled
at
sight
of
corey
showed
traces
of
tears
she
slipped
round
him
into
the
street
but
lapham
stopped
and
said
with
the
show
of
no
feeling
but
surprise
hello
corey
did
you
want
to
go
up
yes
there
were
some
letters
i
had
quite
got
through
with
you
find
dennis
up
there
but
i
guess
you
better
let
them
go
till
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
stop
work
when
i
done
perhaps
you
right
said
corey
yielding
come
along
down
as
far
as
the
boat
with
me
there
a
little
matter
i
want
to
talk
over
with
you
it
was
a
business
matter
and
related
to
corey
proposed
connection
with
the
house
the
next
day
the
head
who
lunched
at
the
long
counter
of
the
same
restaurant
with
corey
began
to
talk
with
him
about
lapham
walker
had
not
apparently
got
his
place
by
seniority
though
with
his
forehead
bald
far
up
toward
the
crown
and
his
round
smooth
face
one
might
have
taken
him
for
a
plump
elder
if
he
had
not
looked
equally
like
a
robust
infant
the
thick
drabbish
yellow
moustache
was
what
arrested
decision
in
either
direction
and
the
prompt
vigour
of
all
his
movements
was
that
of
a
young
man
of
thirty
which
was
really
age
he
knew
of
course
who
corey
was
and
he
had
waited
for
a
man
who
might
look
down
on
him
socially
to
make
the
overtures
toward
something
more
than
business
acquaintance
but
these
made
he
was
readily
responsive
and
drew
freely
on
his
philosophy
of
lapham
and
his
affairs
i
think
about
the
only
difference
between
people
in
this
world
is
that
some
know
what
they
want
and
some
do
well
now
said
walker
beating
the
bottom
of
his
to
make
the
salt
come
out
the
old
man
knows
what
he
wants
every
time
and
generally
he
gets
it
yes
sir
he
generally
gets
it
he
knows
what
he
about
but
i
be
blessed
if
the
rest
of
us
do
half
the
time
anyway
we
do
till
ready
to
let
us
you
take
my
position
in
most
business
houses
confidential
the
head
knows
right
along
pretty
much
everything
the
house
has
got
in
hand
i
give
you
my
word
i
do
he
may
open
up
to
you
a
little
more
in
your
department
but
as
far
as
the
rest
of
us
go
he
do
open
up
any
more
than
an
oyster
on
a
hot
brick
they
say
he
had
a
partner
once
i
guess
he
dead
i
like
to
be
the
old
man
partner
well
you
see
this
paint
of
his
is
like
his
heart
blood
better
not
try
to
joke
him
about
it
seen
people
come
in
occasionally
and
try
it
they
did
get
much
fun
out
of
it
while
he
talked
walker
was
plucking
up
morsels
from
his
plate
tearing
off
pieces
of
french
bread
from
the
long
loaf
and
feeding
them
into
his
mouth
in
an
impersonal
way
as
if
he
were
firing
up
an
engine
i
suppose
he
thinks
suggested
corey
that
if
he
does
tell
nobody
else
will
walker
took
a
draught
of
beer
from
his
glass
and
wiped
the
foam
from
his
moustache
oh
but
he
carries
it
too
far
it
a
weakness
with
him
he
just
so
about
everything
look
at
the
way
he
keeps
it
up
about
that
girl
of
his
you
think
she
was
some
princess
travelling
incognito
there
is
one
of
us
knows
who
she
is
or
where
she
came
from
or
who
she
belongs
to
he
brought
her
and
her
machine
into
the
office
one
morning
and
set
down
at
a
table
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
as
far
as
we
concerned
it
pretty
hard
on
the
girl
for
i
guess
she
like
to
talk
and
to
any
one
that
did
know
the
old
man
walker
broke
off
and
drained
his
glass
of
what
was
left
in
it
corey
thought
of
the
words
he
had
overheard
from
lapham
to
the
girl
but
he
said
she
seems
to
be
kept
pretty
busy
oh
yes
said
walker
there
ai
much
loafing
round
the
place
in
any
of
the
departments
from
the
old
man
down
that
just
what
i
say
he
got
to
work
just
twice
as
hard
if
he
wants
to
keep
everything
in
his
own
mind
but
he
ai
afraid
of
work
that
one
good
thing
about
him
and
miss
dewey
has
to
keep
step
with
the
rest
of
us
but
she
do
look
like
one
that
would
take
to
it
naturally
such
a
pretty
girl
as
that
generally
thinks
she
does
enough
when
she
looks
her
prettiest
she
a
pretty
girl
said
corey
but
i
suppose
a
great
many
pretty
girls
have
to
earn
their
living
do
any
of
like
to
do
it
returned
the
they
think
it
a
hardship
and
i
do
blame
they
have
got
a
right
to
get
married
and
they
ought
to
have
the
chance
and
miss
smart
too
she
as
bright
as
a
biscuit
i
guess
she
had
trouble
i
should
be
much
more
than
half
surprised
if
miss
dewey
was
miss
dewey
or
had
always
been
yes
sir
continued
the
who
prolonged
the
talk
as
they
walked
back
to
lapham
warehouse
together
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
is
it
is
any
one
thing
in
particular
but
i
should
say
that
girl
had
been
married
i
speak
so
freely
to
any
of
the
rest
corey
i
want
you
to
understand
that
and
it
is
any
of
my
business
anyway
but
my
opinion
corey
made
no
reply
as
he
walked
beside
the
who
continued
it
curious
what
a
difference
marriage
makes
in
people
now
i
know
that
i
do
look
any
more
like
a
bachelor
of
my
age
than
i
do
like
the
man
in
the
moon
and
yet
i
could
say
where
the
difference
came
in
to
save
me
and
it
just
so
with
a
woman
the
minute
you
catch
sight
of
her
face
there
something
in
it
that
tells
you
whether
married
or
not
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
i
sure
i
do
know
said
corey
willing
to
laugh
away
the
topic
and
from
what
i
read
occasionally
of
some
people
who
go
about
repeating
their
happiness
i
should
say
that
the
intangible
evidences
were
always
unmistakable
oh
of
course
admitted
walker
easily
surrendering
his
position
all
signs
fail
in
dry
weather
hello
what
that
he
caught
corey
by
the
arm
and
they
both
stopped
at
a
corner
half
a
block
ahead
of
them
the
summer
noon
solitude
of
the
place
was
broken
by
a
bit
of
drama
a
man
and
woman
issued
from
the
intersecting
street
and
at
the
moment
of
coming
into
sight
the
man
who
looked
like
a
sailor
caught
the
woman
by
the
arm
as
if
to
detain
her
a
brief
struggle
ensued
the
woman
trying
to
free
herself
and
the
man
half
coaxing
half
scolding
the
spectators
could
now
see
that
he
was
drunk
but
before
they
could
decide
whether
it
was
a
case
for
their
interference
or
not
the
woman
suddenly
set
both
hands
against
the
man
breast
and
gave
him
a
quick
push
he
lost
his
footing
and
tumbled
into
a
heap
in
the
gutter
the
woman
faltered
an
instant
as
if
to
see
whether
he
was
seriously
hurt
and
then
turned
and
ran
when
corey
and
the
the
office
miss
dewey
had
finished
her
lunch
and
was
putting
a
sheet
of
paper
into
her
she
looked
up
at
them
with
her
eyes
of
turquoise
blue
under
her
low
white
forehead
with
the
hair
neatly
rippled
over
it
and
then
began
to
beat
the
keys
of
her
machine
ix
lapham
had
the
pride
which
comes
of
and
he
would
not
openly
lower
his
crest
to
the
young
fellow
he
had
taken
into
his
business
he
was
going
to
be
obviously
master
in
his
own
place
to
every
one
and
during
the
hours
of
business
he
did
nothing
to
distinguish
corey
from
the
other
clerks
and
in
the
outer
office
but
he
was
not
silent
about
the
fact
that
bromfield
corey
son
had
taken
a
fancy
to
come
to
him
did
you
notice
that
fellow
at
the
desk
facing
my
girl
well
sir
that
the
son
of
bromfield
corey
old
phillips
corey
grandson
and
i
say
this
for
him
that
there
is
a
man
in
the
office
that
looks
after
his
work
better
there
is
anything
he
too
good
for
he
right
here
at
nine
every
morning
before
the
clock
gets
in
the
word
i
guess
his
grandfather
coming
out
in
him
he
got
charge
of
the
foreign
correspondence
we
pushing
the
paint
everywhere
he
flattered
himself
that
he
did
not
lug
the
matter
in
he
had
been
warned
against
that
by
his
wife
but
he
had
the
right
to
do
corey
justice
and
his
brag
took
the
form
of
illustration
talk
about
training
for
business
i
tell
you
it
all
in
the
man
himself
i
used
to
believe
in
what
old
horace
greeley
said
about
college
graduates
being
the
poorest
kind
of
horned
cattle
but
i
changed
my
mind
a
little
you
take
that
fellow
corey
he
been
through
harvard
and
he
had
about
every
advantage
that
a
fellow
could
have
been
everywhere
and
talks
half
a
dozen
languages
like
english
i
suppose
he
got
money
enough
to
live
without
lifting
a
hand
any
more
than
his
father
does
son
of
bromfield
corey
you
know
but
the
thing
was
in
him
he
a
business
man
and
i
had
many
a
fellow
with
me
that
had
come
up
out
of
the
street
and
worked
hard
all
his
life
without
ever
losing
his
original
opposition
to
the
thing
but
corey
likes
it
i
believe
the
fellow
would
like
to
stick
at
that
desk
of
his
night
and
day
i
know
where
he
got
it
i
guess
it
must
be
his
grandfather
old
phillips
corey
it
often
skips
a
generation
you
know
but
what
i
say
is
a
thing
has
got
to
be
born
in
a
man
and
if
it
ai
born
in
him
all
the
privations
in
the
world
wo
put
it
there
and
if
it
is
all
the
college
training
wo
take
it
out
sometimes
lapham
advanced
these
ideas
at
his
own
table
to
a
guest
whom
he
had
brought
to
nantasket
for
the
night
then
he
suffered
exposure
and
ridicule
at
the
hands
of
his
wife
when
opportunity
offered
she
would
not
let
him
bring
corey
down
to
nantasket
at
all
no
indeed
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
have
them
think
running
after
him
if
he
wants
to
see
irene
he
can
find
out
ways
of
doing
it
for
himself
who
wants
him
to
see
irene
retorted
the
colonel
angrily
i
do
said
lapham
and
i
want
him
to
see
her
without
any
of
your
connivance
silas
i
not
going
to
have
it
said
that
i
put
my
girls
at
anybody
why
do
you
invite
some
of
your
other
clerks
he
ai
just
like
the
other
clerks
he
going
to
take
charge
of
a
part
of
the
business
it
quite
another
thing
oh
indeed
said
lapham
vexatiously
then
you
are
going
to
take
a
partner
i
shall
ask
him
down
if
i
choose
returned
the
colonel
disdaining
her
insinuation
his
wife
laughed
with
the
fearlessness
of
a
woman
who
knows
her
husband
but
you
wo
choose
when
you
thought
it
over
si
then
she
applied
an
emollient
to
his
chafed
surface
do
you
suppose
i
feel
as
you
do
about
it
i
know
just
how
proud
you
are
and
i
not
going
to
have
you
do
anything
that
will
make
you
feel
meeching
afterward
you
just
let
things
take
their
course
if
he
wants
irene
he
going
to
find
out
some
way
of
seeing
her
and
if
he
do
all
the
plotting
and
planning
in
the
world
is
going
to
make
him
who
plotting
again
retorted
the
colonel
shuddering
at
the
utterance
of
hopes
and
ambitions
which
a
man
hides
with
shame
but
a
woman
talks
over
as
freely
and
coolly
as
if
they
were
items
of
a
milliner
bill
oh
not
you
exulted
his
wife
i
understand
what
you
want
you
want
to
get
this
fellow
who
is
neither
partner
nor
clerk
down
here
to
talk
business
with
him
well
now
you
just
talk
business
with
him
at
the
office
the
only
social
attention
which
lapham
succeeded
in
offering
corey
was
to
take
him
in
his
buggy
now
and
then
for
a
spin
out
over
the
he
kept
the
mare
in
town
and
on
a
pleasant
afternoon
he
liked
to
knock
off
early
as
he
phrased
it
and
let
the
mare
out
a
little
corey
understood
something
about
horses
though
in
a
passionless
way
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
talk
business
when
obliged
to
talk
horse
but
he
deferred
to
his
business
superior
with
the
sense
of
discipline
which
is
innate
in
the
apparently
insubordinate
american
nature
if
corey
could
hardly
have
helped
feeling
the
social
difference
between
lapham
and
himself
in
his
presence
he
silenced
his
traditions
and
showed
him
all
the
respect
that
he
could
have
exacted
from
any
of
his
clerks
he
talked
horse
with
him
and
when
the
colonel
wished
he
talked
house
besides
himself
and
his
paint
lapham
had
not
many
other
topics
and
if
he
had
a
choice
between
the
mare
and
the
edifice
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
street
it
was
just
now
the
latter
sometimes
in
driving
in
or
out
he
stopped
at
the
house
and
made
corey
his
guest
there
if
he
might
not
at
nantasket
and
one
day
it
happened
that
the
young
man
met
irene
there
again
she
had
come
up
with
her
mother
alone
and
they
were
in
the
house
interviewing
the
carpenter
as
before
when
the
colonel
jumped
out
of
his
buggy
and
cast
anchor
at
the
pavement
more
exactly
lapham
was
interviewing
the
carpenter
and
irene
was
sitting
in
the
on
a
trestle
and
looking
out
at
the
driving
she
saw
him
come
up
with
her
father
and
bowed
and
blushed
her
father
went
on
to
find
her
mother
and
corey
pulled
up
another
trestle
which
he
found
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
the
first
floorings
had
been
laid
throughout
the
house
and
the
partitions
had
been
lathed
so
that
one
could
realise
the
shape
of
the
interior
i
suppose
you
will
sit
at
this
window
a
good
deal
said
the
young
man
yes
i
think
it
will
be
very
nice
there
so
much
more
going
on
than
there
is
in
the
square
it
must
be
very
interesting
to
you
to
see
the
house
grow
it
is
only
it
does
seem
to
grow
so
fast
as
i
expected
why
i
amazed
at
the
progress
your
carpenter
has
made
every
time
i
come
the
girl
looked
down
and
then
lifting
her
eyes
she
said
with
a
sort
of
timorous
appeal
i
been
reading
that
book
since
you
were
down
at
nantasket
book
repeated
corey
while
she
reddened
with
disappointment
oh
yes
middlemarch
did
you
like
it
i
have
got
through
with
it
yet
pen
has
finished
it
what
does
she
think
of
it
oh
i
think
she
likes
it
very
well
i
have
heard
her
talk
about
it
much
do
you
like
it
yes
i
liked
it
immensely
but
it
several
years
since
i
read
it
i
did
know
it
was
so
old
it
just
got
into
the
seaside
library
she
urged
with
a
little
sense
of
injury
in
her
tone
oh
it
has
been
out
such
a
very
great
while
said
corey
politely
it
came
a
little
before
daniel
deronda
the
girl
was
again
silent
she
followed
the
curl
of
a
shaving
on
the
floor
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
do
you
like
that
rosamond
vincy
she
asked
without
looking
up
corey
smiled
in
his
kind
way
i
did
suppose
she
was
expected
to
have
any
friends
i
ca
say
i
liked
her
but
i
do
think
i
disliked
her
so
much
as
the
author
does
she
pretty
hard
on
her
he
was
going
to
say
girls
but
as
if
that
might
have
been
rather
personal
he
said
people
yes
that
what
pen
says
she
says
she
does
give
her
any
chance
to
be
good
she
says
she
should
have
been
just
as
bad
as
rosamond
if
she
had
been
in
her
place
the
young
man
laughed
your
sister
is
very
satirical
is
she
i
do
know
said
irene
still
intent
upon
the
convolutions
of
the
shaving
she
keeps
us
laughing
papa
thinks
there
nobody
that
can
talk
like
her
she
gave
the
shaving
a
little
toss
from
her
and
took
the
parasol
up
across
her
lap
the
unworldliness
of
the
lapham
girls
did
not
extend
to
their
dress
irene
costume
was
very
stylish
and
she
governed
her
head
and
shoulders
stylishly
we
are
going
to
have
the
back
room
upstairs
for
a
and
library
she
said
abruptly
yes
returned
corey
i
should
think
that
would
be
charming
we
expected
to
have
but
the
architect
wants
to
build
the
shelves
in
the
fact
seemed
to
be
referred
to
corey
for
his
comment
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
the
best
way
they
look
like
part
of
the
room
then
you
can
make
them
low
and
hang
your
pictures
above
them
yes
that
what
he
said
the
girl
looked
out
of
the
window
in
adding
i
presume
with
nice
bindings
it
will
look
very
well
oh
nothing
furnishes
a
room
like
books
no
there
will
have
to
be
a
good
many
of
them
that
depends
upon
the
size
of
your
room
and
the
number
of
your
shelves
oh
of
course
i
presume
said
irene
thoughtfully
we
shall
have
to
have
gibbon
if
you
want
to
read
him
said
corey
with
a
laugh
of
sympathy
for
an
imaginable
joke
we
had
a
great
deal
about
him
at
school
i
believe
we
had
one
of
his
books
mine
lost
but
pen
will
remember
the
young
man
looked
at
her
and
then
said
seriously
you
want
greene
of
course
and
motley
and
parkman
yes
what
kind
of
writers
are
they
they
historians
too
oh
yes
i
remember
now
that
what
gibbon
was
is
it
gibbon
or
gibbons
the
young
man
decided
the
point
with
apparently
superfluous
delicacy
gibbon
i
think
there
used
to
be
so
many
of
them
said
irene
gaily
i
used
to
get
them
mixed
up
with
each
other
and
i
could
tell
them
from
the
poets
should
you
want
to
have
poetry
yes
i
suppose
some
edition
of
the
english
poets
we
do
any
of
us
like
poetry
do
you
like
it
i
afraid
i
do
very
much
corey
owned
but
of
course
there
was
a
time
when
tennyson
was
a
great
deal
more
to
me
than
he
is
now
we
had
something
about
him
at
school
too
i
think
i
remember
the
name
i
think
we
ought
to
have
all
the
american
poets
well
not
all
five
or
six
of
the
best
you
want
longfellow
and
bryant
and
whittier
and
holmes
and
emerson
and
lowell
the
girl
listened
attentively
as
if
making
mental
note
of
the
names
and
shakespeare
she
added
do
you
like
shakespeare
plays
oh
yes
very
much
i
used
to
be
perfectly
crazy
about
his
plays
do
you
think
is
splendid
we
had
ever
so
much
about
shakespeare
you
perfectly
astonished
when
you
found
out
how
many
other
plays
of
his
there
were
i
always
thought
there
was
nothing
but
and
and
juliet
and
and
iii
and
lear
and
that
one
that
robeson
and
crane
have
oh
yes
of
errors
those
are
the
ones
they
usually
play
said
corey
i
presume
we
shall
have
to
have
scott
works
said
irene
returning
to
the
question
of
books
oh
yes
one
of
the
girls
used
to
think
he
was
great
she
was
always
talking
about
scott
irene
made
a
pretty
little
amiably
contemptuous
mouth
he
is
american
though
she
suggested
no
said
corey
he
scotch
i
believe
irene
passed
her
glove
over
her
forehead
i
always
get
him
mixed
up
with
cooper
well
papa
has
got
to
get
them
if
we
have
a
library
we
have
got
to
have
books
in
it
pen
says
it
perfectly
ridiculous
having
one
but
papa
thinks
whatever
the
architect
says
is
right
he
fought
him
hard
enough
at
first
i
do
see
how
any
one
can
keep
the
poets
and
the
historians
and
novelists
separate
in
their
mind
of
course
papa
will
buy
them
if
we
say
so
but
i
do
see
how
i
ever
going
to
tell
him
which
ones
the
joyous
light
faded
out
of
her
face
and
left
it
pensive
why
if
you
like
said
the
young
man
taking
out
his
pencil
put
down
the
names
we
been
talking
about
he
clapped
himself
on
his
breast
pockets
to
detect
some
lurking
scrap
of
paper
will
you
she
cried
delightedly
here
take
one
of
my
cards
and
she
pulled
out
her
the
carpenter
writes
on
a
block
and
puts
it
into
his
pocket
and
it
so
uncomfortable
he
help
remembering
it
pen
says
she
going
to
adopt
the
plan
with
papa
thank
you
said
corey
i
believe
i
use
your
card
he
crossed
over
to
her
and
after
a
moment
sat
down
on
the
trestle
beside
her
she
looked
over
the
card
as
he
wrote
those
are
the
ones
we
mentioned
but
perhaps
i
better
add
a
few
others
oh
thank
you
she
said
when
he
had
written
the
card
full
on
both
sides
he
has
got
to
get
them
in
the
nicest
binding
too
i
shall
tell
him
about
their
helping
to
furnish
the
room
and
then
he
object
she
remained
with
the
card
looking
at
it
rather
wistfully
perhaps
corey
divined
her
trouble
of
mind
if
he
will
take
that
to
any
bookseller
and
tell
him
what
bindings
he
wants
he
will
fill
the
order
for
him
oh
thank
you
very
much
she
said
and
put
the
card
back
into
her
with
great
apparent
relief
then
she
turned
her
lovely
face
toward
the
young
man
beaming
with
the
triumph
a
woman
feels
in
any
bit
of
successful
manoeuvring
and
began
to
talk
with
recovered
gaiety
of
other
things
as
if
having
got
rid
of
a
matter
annoying
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
importance
she
was
now
going
to
indemnify
herself
corey
did
not
return
to
his
own
trestle
she
found
another
shaving
within
reach
of
her
parasol
and
began
poking
that
with
it
and
trying
to
follow
it
through
its
folds
corey
watched
her
a
while
you
seem
to
have
a
great
passion
for
playing
with
shavings
he
said
is
it
a
new
one
new
what
passion
i
do
know
she
said
dropping
her
eyelids
and
keeping
on
with
her
effort
she
looked
shyly
aslant
at
him
perhaps
you
do
approve
of
playing
with
shavings
oh
yes
i
do
i
admire
it
very
much
but
it
seems
rather
difficult
i
a
great
ambition
to
put
my
foot
on
the
shaving
tail
and
hold
it
for
you
well
said
the
girl
thank
you
said
the
young
man
he
did
so
and
now
she
ran
her
parasol
point
easily
through
it
they
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
that
was
wonderful
would
you
like
to
try
another
he
asked
no
i
thank
you
she
replied
i
think
one
will
do
they
both
laughed
again
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason
and
then
the
young
girl
became
sober
to
a
girl
everything
a
young
man
does
is
of
significance
and
if
he
holds
a
shaving
down
with
his
foot
while
she
pokes
through
it
with
her
parasol
she
must
ask
herself
what
he
means
by
it
they
seem
to
be
having
rather
a
long
interview
with
the
carpenter
said
irene
looking
vaguely
toward
the
ceiling
she
turned
with
polite
ceremony
to
corey
i
afraid
you
letting
them
keep
you
you
must
oh
no
you
letting
me
stay
he
returned
she
bridled
and
bit
her
lip
for
pleasure
i
presume
they
will
be
down
before
a
great
while
do
you
like
the
smell
of
the
wood
and
the
mortar
it
so
fresh
yes
it
delicious
he
bent
forward
and
picked
up
from
the
floor
the
shaving
with
which
they
had
been
playing
and
put
it
to
his
nose
it
like
a
flower
may
i
offer
it
to
you
he
asked
as
if
it
had
been
one
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
took
it
from
him
and
put
it
into
her
belt
and
then
they
both
laughed
once
more
steps
were
heard
descending
when
the
elder
people
reached
the
floor
where
they
were
sitting
corey
rose
and
presently
took
his
leave
what
makes
you
so
solemn
asked
lapham
solemn
echoed
the
girl
i
not
a
bit
solemn
what
can
you
mean
corey
dined
at
home
that
evening
and
as
he
sat
looking
across
the
table
at
his
father
he
said
i
wonder
what
the
average
literature
of
people
is
ah
said
the
elder
i
suspect
the
average
is
pretty
low
even
with
cultivated
people
you
do
read
a
great
many
books
yourself
tom
no
i
do
the
young
man
confessed
i
read
more
books
when
i
was
with
stanton
last
winter
than
i
had
since
i
was
a
boy
but
i
read
them
because
i
must
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
it
was
because
i
was
fond
of
reading
still
i
think
i
read
with
some
sense
of
literature
and
the
difference
between
authors
i
do
suppose
that
people
generally
do
that
i
have
met
people
who
had
read
books
without
troubling
themselves
to
find
out
even
the
author
name
much
less
trying
to
decide
upon
his
quality
i
suppose
that
the
way
the
vast
majority
of
people
read
yes
if
authors
were
not
almost
necessarily
recluses
and
ignorant
of
the
ignorance
about
them
i
do
see
how
they
could
endure
it
of
course
they
are
fated
to
be
overwhelmed
by
oblivion
at
last
poor
fellows
but
to
see
it
weltering
all
round
them
while
they
are
in
the
very
act
of
achieving
immortality
must
be
tremendously
discouraging
i
do
suppose
that
we
who
have
the
habit
of
reading
and
at
least
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
literature
can
imagine
the
bestial
darkness
of
the
great
mass
of
people
even
people
whose
houses
are
rich
and
whose
linen
is
purple
and
fine
but
occasionally
we
get
glimpses
of
it
i
suppose
you
found
the
latest
publications
lying
all
about
in
lapham
cottage
when
you
were
down
there
young
corey
laughed
it
was
exactly
cumbered
with
them
no
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
suppose
they
ever
buy
books
the
young
ladies
get
novels
that
they
hear
talked
of
out
of
the
circulating
library
had
they
knowledge
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
their
ignorance
yes
in
certain
ways
to
a
certain
degree
it
a
curious
thing
this
thing
we
call
civilisation
said
the
elder
musingly
we
think
it
is
an
affair
of
epochs
and
of
nations
really
an
affair
of
individuals
one
brother
will
be
civilised
and
the
other
a
barbarian
i
occasionally
met
young
girls
who
were
so
brutally
insolently
wilfully
indifferent
to
the
arts
which
make
civilisation
that
they
ought
to
have
been
clothed
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
gone
about
barefoot
with
clubs
over
their
shoulders
yet
they
were
of
polite
origin
and
their
parents
were
at
least
respectful
of
the
things
that
these
young
animals
despised
i
do
think
that
is
exactly
the
case
with
the
lapham
family
said
the
son
smiling
the
father
and
mother
rather
apologised
about
not
getting
time
to
read
and
the
young
ladies
by
no
means
scorned
it
they
are
quite
advanced
they
are
going
to
have
a
library
in
their
beacon
street
house
oh
poor
things
how
are
they
ever
going
to
get
the
books
together
well
sir
said
the
son
colouring
a
little
i
have
been
indirectly
applied
to
for
help
you
tom
his
father
dropped
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
i
recommended
the
standard
authors
said
the
son
oh
i
never
supposed
your
prudence
would
be
at
fault
tom
but
seriously
said
the
young
man
generously
smiling
in
sympathy
with
his
father
enjoyment
they
not
unintelligent
people
they
are
very
quick
and
they
are
shrewd
and
sensible
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
sioux
are
so
but
that
is
not
saying
that
they
are
civilised
all
civilisation
comes
through
literature
now
especially
in
our
country
a
greek
got
his
civilisation
by
talking
and
looking
and
in
some
measure
a
parisian
may
still
do
it
but
we
who
live
remote
from
history
and
monuments
we
must
read
or
we
must
barbarise
once
we
were
softened
if
not
polished
by
religion
but
i
suspect
that
the
pulpit
counts
for
much
less
now
in
civilising
they
enormous
devourers
of
newspapers
and
and
they
go
a
great
deal
to
lectures
the
colonel
prefers
them
with
the
stereopticon
they
might
get
a
something
in
that
way
said
the
elder
thoughtfully
yes
i
suppose
one
must
take
those
things
into
account
especially
the
newspapers
and
the
lectures
i
doubt
if
the
theatre
is
a
factor
in
civilisation
among
us
i
dare
say
it
does
deprave
a
great
deal
but
from
what
i
seen
of
it
i
should
say
that
it
was
intellectually
degrading
perhaps
they
might
get
some
sort
of
lift
from
it
i
know
tom
he
added
after
a
moment
reflection
i
really
think
i
ought
to
see
this
patron
of
yours
do
you
think
it
would
be
rather
decent
in
me
to
make
his
acquaintance
well
if
you
have
the
fancy
sir
said
the
young
man
but
no
sort
of
obligation
colonel
lapham
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
want
to
give
our
relation
any
sort
of
social
character
the
meeting
will
come
about
in
the
natural
course
of
things
ah
i
did
intend
to
propose
anything
immediate
said
the
father
one
ca
do
anything
in
the
summer
and
i
should
prefer
your
superintendence
still
i
ca
rid
myself
of
the
idea
of
a
dinner
it
appears
to
me
that
there
ought
to
be
a
dinner
oh
pray
do
feel
that
there
any
necessity
well
said
the
elder
with
easy
resignation
there
at
least
no
hurry
there
is
one
thing
i
do
like
said
lapham
in
the
course
of
one
of
those
talks
which
came
up
between
his
wife
and
himself
concerning
corey
or
at
least
i
do
understand
it
and
that
the
way
his
father
behaves
i
do
want
to
force
myself
on
any
man
but
it
seems
to
me
pretty
queer
the
way
he
holds
off
i
should
think
he
would
take
enough
interest
in
his
son
to
want
to
know
something
about
his
business
what
is
he
afraid
of
demanded
lapham
angrily
does
he
think
i
going
to
jump
at
a
chance
to
get
in
with
him
if
he
gives
me
one
he
mightily
mistaken
if
he
does
i
do
want
to
know
him
silas
said
his
wife
making
a
wife
free
version
of
her
words
and
replying
to
their
spirit
rather
than
their
letter
i
hope
you
never
said
a
word
to
corey
to
let
him
know
the
way
you
feel
i
never
mentioned
his
father
to
him
roared
the
colonel
that
the
way
i
feel
about
it
because
it
would
spoil
everything
i
would
have
them
think
we
cared
the
least
thing
in
the
world
for
their
acquaintance
we
should
be
a
bit
better
off
we
do
know
the
same
people
they
do
and
we
do
care
for
the
same
kind
of
things
lapham
was
breathless
with
resentment
of
his
wife
implication
do
i
tell
you
he
gasped
that
i
do
want
to
know
them
who
began
it
they
friends
of
yours
if
they
anybody
they
distant
acquaintances
of
mine
returned
lapham
quietly
and
this
young
corey
is
a
clerk
of
yours
and
i
want
we
should
hold
ourselves
so
that
when
they
get
ready
to
make
the
advances
we
can
meet
them
or
not
just
as
we
choose
that
what
grinds
me
cried
her
husband
why
should
we
wait
for
them
to
make
the
advances
why
should
we
make
are
they
any
better
than
we
are
my
note
of
hand
would
be
worth
ten
times
what
bromfield
corey
is
on
the
street
and
i
made
my
money
i
have
loafed
my
life
away
oh
it
is
what
you
got
and
it
is
what
you
done
exactly
it
what
you
are
well
then
what
the
difference
none
that
really
amounts
to
anything
or
that
need
give
you
any
trouble
if
you
do
think
of
it
but
he
been
all
his
life
in
society
and
he
knows
just
what
to
say
and
what
to
do
and
he
can
talk
about
the
things
that
society
people
like
to
talk
about
and
you
ca
lapham
gave
a
furious
snort
and
does
that
make
him
any
better
no
but
it
puts
him
where
he
can
make
the
advances
without
demeaning
himself
and
it
puts
you
where
you
ca
now
look
here
silas
lapham
you
understand
this
thing
as
well
as
i
do
you
know
that
i
appreciate
you
and
that
i
sooner
die
than
have
you
humble
yourself
to
a
living
soul
but
i
not
going
to
have
you
coming
to
me
and
pretending
that
you
can
meet
bromfield
corey
as
an
equal
on
his
own
ground
you
ca
he
got
a
better
education
than
you
and
if
he
has
got
more
brains
than
you
he
got
different
and
he
and
his
wife
and
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
before
have
always
had
a
high
position
and
you
ca
help
it
if
you
want
to
know
them
you
got
to
let
them
make
the
advances
if
you
do
all
well
and
good
i
guess
said
the
chafed
and
vanquished
colonel
after
a
moment
for
swallowing
the
pill
that
they
have
been
in
a
pretty
fix
if
waited
to
let
them
make
the
advances
last
summer
that
was
a
different
thing
altogether
i
did
know
who
they
were
or
may
be
i
should
have
waited
but
all
i
say
now
is
that
if
got
young
corey
into
business
with
you
in
hopes
of
our
getting
into
society
with
his
father
you
better
ship
him
at
once
for
i
going
to
have
it
on
that
basis
who
wants
to
have
it
on
that
basis
retorted
her
husband
nobody
if
you
do
said
lapham
tranquilly
irene
had
come
home
with
the
shaving
in
her
belt
unnoticed
by
her
father
and
unquestioned
by
her
mother
but
her
sister
saw
it
at
once
and
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
with
it
oh
nothing
said
irene
with
a
joyful
smile
of
taking
the
shaving
carefully
out
and
laying
it
among
the
laces
and
ribbons
in
her
drawer
had
you
better
put
it
in
water
it
be
all
wilted
by
morning
said
pen
you
mean
thing
cried
the
happy
girl
it
is
a
flower
oh
i
thought
it
was
a
whole
bouquet
who
gave
it
to
you
i
sha
tell
you
said
irene
saucily
oh
well
never
mind
did
you
know
corey
had
been
down
here
this
afternoon
walking
on
the
beach
with
me
he
was
he
was
at
all
he
was
at
the
house
with
me
there
caught
you
fairly
is
that
so
drawled
penelope
then
i
never
could
guess
who
gave
you
that
precious
shaving
no
you
could
said
irene
flushing
beautifully
and
you
may
guess
and
you
may
guess
and
you
may
guess
with
her
lovely
eyes
she
coaxed
her
sister
to
keep
on
teasing
her
and
penelope
continued
the
comedy
with
the
patience
that
women
have
for
such
things
well
i
not
going
to
try
if
it
no
use
but
i
did
know
it
had
got
to
be
the
fashion
to
give
shavings
instead
of
flowers
but
some
sense
in
it
they
can
be
used
for
kindlings
when
they
get
old
and
you
ca
do
anything
with
old
flowers
perhaps
he
get
to
sending
by
the
barrel
irene
laughed
for
pleasure
in
this
tormenting
o
pen
i
want
to
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
oh
he
did
give
it
to
you
then
well
i
guess
i
do
care
to
hear
you
shall
and
you
got
to
irene
ran
and
caught
her
sister
who
feigned
to
be
going
out
of
the
room
and
pushed
her
into
a
chair
there
now
she
pulled
up
another
chair
and
hemmed
her
in
with
it
he
came
over
and
sat
down
on
the
trestle
alongside
of
me
what
as
close
as
you
are
to
me
now
you
wretch
i
will
give
it
to
you
no
at
a
proper
distance
and
here
was
this
shaving
on
the
floor
that
i
been
poking
with
my
parasol
to
hide
your
embarrassment
pshaw
i
was
a
bit
embarrassed
i
was
just
as
much
at
my
ease
and
then
he
asked
me
to
let
him
hold
the
shaving
down
with
his
foot
while
i
went
on
with
my
poking
and
i
said
yes
he
might
what
a
bold
girl
you
said
he
might
hold
a
shaving
down
for
you
and
then
and
then
continued
irene
lifting
her
eyes
absently
and
losing
herself
in
the
beatific
recollection
and
then
oh
yes
then
i
asked
him
if
he
did
like
the
smell
of
pine
shavings
and
then
he
picked
it
up
and
said
it
smelt
like
a
flower
and
then
he
asked
if
he
might
offer
it
to
me
just
for
a
joke
you
know
and
i
took
it
and
stuck
it
in
my
belt
and
we
had
such
a
laugh
we
got
into
a
regular
gale
and
o
pen
what
do
you
suppose
he
meant
by
it
she
suddenly
caught
herself
to
her
sister
breast
and
hid
her
burning
face
on
her
shoulder
well
there
used
to
be
a
book
about
the
language
of
flowers
but
i
never
knew
much
about
the
language
of
shavings
and
i
ca
say
exactly
oh
do
do
pen
and
here
irene
gave
over
laughing
and
began
to
sob
in
her
sister
arms
why
cried
the
elder
girl
you
know
he
did
mean
anything
he
does
care
a
bit
about
me
he
hates
me
he
despises
me
oh
what
shall
i
do
a
trouble
passed
over
the
face
of
the
sister
as
she
silently
comforted
the
child
in
her
arms
then
the
drolling
light
came
back
into
her
eyes
well
you
have
got
to
do
anything
that
one
advantage
girls
have
got
if
it
is
an
advantage
i
not
always
sure
irene
tears
turned
to
laughing
again
when
she
lifted
her
head
it
was
to
look
into
the
mirror
confronting
them
where
her
beauty
showed
all
the
more
brilliant
for
the
shower
that
had
passed
over
it
she
seemed
to
gather
courage
from
the
sight
it
must
be
awful
to
have
to
do
she
said
smiling
into
her
own
face
i
do
see
how
they
ever
can
some
of
ca
especially
when
there
such
a
tearing
beauty
around
oh
pshaw
pen
you
know
that
is
so
you
got
a
real
pretty
mouth
pen
she
added
thoughtfully
surveying
the
feature
in
the
glass
and
then
pouting
her
own
lips
for
the
sake
of
that
effect
on
them
it
a
useful
mouth
penelope
admitted
i
do
believe
i
could
get
along
without
it
now
i
had
it
so
long
it
got
such
a
funny
expression
just
the
mate
of
the
look
in
your
eyes
as
if
you
were
just
going
to
say
something
ridiculous
he
said
the
very
first
time
he
saw
you
that
he
knew
you
were
humorous
is
it
possible
it
must
be
so
if
the
grand
mogul
said
it
why
you
tell
me
so
before
and
not
let
me
keep
on
going
round
just
like
a
common
person
irene
laughed
as
if
she
liked
to
have
her
sister
take
his
praises
in
that
way
rather
than
another
i
got
such
a
stiff
prim
kind
of
mouth
she
said
drawing
it
down
and
then
looking
anxiously
at
it
i
hope
you
did
put
on
that
expression
when
he
offered
you
the
shaving
if
you
did
i
do
believe
he
ever
give
you
another
splinter
the
severe
mouth
broke
into
a
lovely
laugh
and
then
pressed
itself
in
a
kiss
against
penelope
cheek
there
be
done
you
silly
thing
i
not
going
to
have
you
accepting
me
before
i
offered
myself
anyway
she
freed
herself
from
her
sister
embrace
and
ran
from
her
round
the
room
irene
pursued
her
in
the
need
of
hiding
her
face
against
her
shoulder
again
o
pen
o
pen
she
cried
the
next
day
at
the
first
moment
of
finding
herself
alone
with
her
eldest
daughter
lapham
asked
as
if
knowing
that
penelope
must
have
already
made
it
subject
of
inquiry
what
was
irene
doing
with
that
shaving
in
her
belt
yesterday
oh
just
some
nonsense
of
hers
with
corey
he
gave
it
to
her
at
the
new
house
penelope
did
not
choose
to
look
up
and
meet
her
mother
grave
glance
what
do
you
think
he
meant
by
it
penelope
repeated
irene
account
of
the
affair
and
her
mother
listened
without
seeming
to
derive
much
encouragement
from
it
he
does
seem
like
one
to
flirt
with
her
she
said
at
last
then
after
a
thoughtful
pause
irene
is
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
breathed
and
she
a
perfect
beauty
but
i
should
hate
the
day
when
a
daughter
of
mine
was
married
for
her
beauty
you
safe
as
far
as
i
concerned
mother
lapham
smiled
ruefully
she
is
really
equal
to
him
pen
i
misdoubted
that
from
the
first
and
it
been
borne
in
upon
me
more
and
more
ever
since
she
has
mind
enough
i
did
know
that
a
man
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
intellect
said
penelope
quietly
oh
no
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
irene
at
all
if
he
had
it
would
matter
about
the
intellect
penelope
let
the
pass
perhaps
he
has
after
all
no
said
lapham
she
pleases
him
when
he
sees
her
but
he
does
try
to
see
her
he
has
no
chance
you
wo
let
father
bring
him
here
he
would
find
excuses
to
come
without
being
brought
if
he
wished
to
come
said
the
mother
but
she
is
in
his
mind
enough
to
make
him
he
goes
away
and
does
think
anything
more
about
her
she
a
child
she
a
good
child
and
i
shall
always
say
it
but
she
nothing
but
a
child
no
she
got
to
forget
him
perhaps
that
wo
be
so
easy
no
i
presume
not
and
now
your
father
has
got
the
notion
in
his
head
and
he
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
bring
it
to
pass
i
can
see
that
he
always
thinking
about
it
the
colonel
has
a
will
of
his
own
observed
the
girl
rocking
to
and
fro
where
she
sat
looking
at
her
mother
i
wish
we
had
never
met
them
cried
lapham
i
wish
we
had
never
thought
of
building
i
wish
he
had
kept
away
from
your
business
well
it
too
late
now
mother
said
the
girl
perhaps
it
is
so
bad
as
you
think
well
we
must
stand
it
anyway
said
lapham
with
the
grim
antique
yankee
submission
oh
yes
we
got
to
stand
it
said
penelope
with
the
quaint
modern
american
fatalism
x
it
was
late
june
almost
july
when
corey
took
up
his
life
in
boston
again
where
the
summer
slips
away
so
easily
if
you
go
out
of
town
early
it
seems
a
very
long
summer
when
you
come
back
in
october
but
if
you
stay
it
passes
swiftly
and
seen
foreshortened
in
its
flight
seems
scarcely
a
month
length
it
has
its
days
of
heat
when
it
is
very
hot
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
cool
with
baths
of
the
east
wind
that
seem
to
saturate
the
soul
with
delicious
freshness
then
there
are
stretches
of
grey
westerly
weather
when
the
air
is
full
of
the
sentiment
of
early
autumn
and
the
frying
of
the
grasshopper
in
the
blossomed
weed
of
the
vacant
lots
on
the
back
bay
is
intershot
with
the
carol
of
crickets
and
the
yellowing
leaf
on
the
long
slope
of
mt
vernon
street
smites
the
sauntering
observer
with
tender
melancholy
the
caterpillar
gorged
with
the
spoil
of
the
lindens
on
chestnut
and
weaving
his
own
shroud
about
him
in
his
lodgment
on
the
records
the
passing
of
summer
by
and
if
after
that
comes
august
its
breath
is
thick
and
short
and
september
is
upon
the
sojourner
before
he
has
fairly
had
time
to
philosophise
the
character
of
the
town
out
of
season
but
it
must
have
appeared
that
its
most
characteristic
feature
was
the
absence
of
everybody
he
knew
this
was
one
of
the
things
that
commended
boston
to
bromfield
corey
during
the
summer
and
if
his
son
had
any
qualms
about
the
life
he
had
entered
upon
with
such
vigour
it
must
have
been
a
relief
to
him
that
there
was
scarcely
a
soul
left
to
wonder
or
pity
by
the
time
people
got
back
to
town
the
fact
of
his
connection
with
the
mineral
paint
man
would
be
an
old
story
heard
afar
off
with
different
degrees
of
surprise
and
considered
with
different
degrees
of
indifference
a
man
has
not
reached
the
age
of
in
any
community
where
he
was
born
and
reared
without
having
had
his
capacity
pretty
well
ascertained
and
in
boston
the
analysis
is
conducted
with
an
unsparing
thoroughness
which
may
fitly
impress
the
mind
darkened
by
the
popular
superstition
that
the
bostonians
blindly
admire
one
another
a
man
qualities
are
sifted
as
closely
in
boston
as
they
doubtless
were
in
florence
or
athens
and
if
final
mercy
was
shown
in
those
cities
because
a
man
was
with
all
his
limitations
an
athenian
or
florentine
some
abatement
might
as
justly
be
made
in
boston
for
like
reason
corey
powers
had
been
gauged
in
college
and
he
had
not
given
his
world
reason
to
think
very
differently
of
him
since
he
came
out
of
college
he
was
rated
as
an
energetic
fellow
a
little
indefinite
in
aim
with
the
smallest
amount
of
inspiration
that
can
save
a
man
from
being
commonplace
if
he
was
not
commonplace
it
was
through
nothing
remarkable
in
his
mind
which
was
simply
clear
and
practical
but
through
some
combination
of
qualities
of
the
heart
that
made
men
trust
him
and
women
call
him
sweet
a
word
of
theirs
which
conveys
otherwise
indefinable
excellences
some
of
the
more
nervous
and
excitable
said
that
tom
corey
was
as
sweet
as
he
could
live
but
this
perhaps
meant
no
more
than
the
word
alone
no
man
ever
had
a
son
less
like
him
than
bromfield
corey
if
tom
corey
had
ever
said
a
witty
thing
no
one
could
remember
it
and
yet
the
father
had
never
said
a
witty
thing
to
a
more
sympathetic
listener
than
his
own
son
the
clear
mind
which
produced
nothing
but
practical
results
reflected
everything
with
charming
lucidity
and
it
must
have
been
this
which
endeared
tom
corey
to
every
one
who
spoke
ten
words
with
him
in
a
city
where
people
have
good
reason
for
liking
to
shine
a
man
who
did
not
care
to
shine
must
be
little
short
of
universally
acceptable
without
any
other
effort
for
popularity
and
those
who
admired
and
enjoyed
bromfield
corey
loved
his
son
yet
when
it
came
to
accounting
for
tom
corey
as
it
often
did
in
a
community
where
every
one
generation
is
known
to
the
remotest
degrees
of
cousinship
they
could
not
trace
his
sweetness
to
his
mother
for
neither
anna
bellingham
nor
any
of
her
family
though
they
were
so
many
blocks
of
wenham
ice
for
purity
and
rectangularity
had
ever
had
any
such
savour
and
in
fact
it
was
to
his
father
whose
habit
of
talk
wronged
it
in
himself
that
they
had
to
turn
for
this
quality
of
the
son
they
traced
to
the
mother
the
traits
of
practicality
and
in
which
he
bordered
upon
the
commonplace
and
which
when
they
had
dwelt
upon
them
made
him
seem
hardly
worth
the
close
inquiry
they
had
given
him
while
the
summer
wore
away
he
came
and
went
methodically
about
his
business
as
if
it
had
been
the
business
of
his
life
sharing
his
father
bachelor
liberty
and
solitude
and
expecting
with
equal
patience
the
return
of
his
mother
and
sisters
in
the
autumn
once
or
twice
he
found
time
to
run
down
to
mt
desert
and
see
them
and
then
he
heard
how
the
philadelphia
and
new
york
people
were
getting
in
everywhere
and
was
given
reason
to
regret
the
house
at
nahant
which
he
had
urged
to
be
sold
he
came
back
and
applied
himself
to
his
desk
with
a
devotion
that
was
exemplary
rather
than
necessary
for
lapham
made
no
difficulty
about
the
brief
absences
which
he
asked
and
set
no
term
to
the
apprenticeship
that
corey
was
serving
in
the
office
before
setting
off
upon
that
mission
to
south
america
in
the
early
winter
for
which
no
date
had
yet
been
fixed
the
summer
was
a
dull
season
for
the
paint
as
well
as
for
everything
else
till
things
should
brisk
up
as
lapham
said
in
the
fall
he
was
letting
the
new
house
take
a
great
deal
of
his
time
aesthetic
ideas
had
never
been
intelligibly
presented
to
him
before
and
he
found
a
delight
in
apprehending
them
that
was
very
grateful
to
his
imaginative
architect
at
the
beginning
the
architect
had
foreboded
a
series
of
mortifying
defeats
and
disastrous
victories
in
his
encounters
with
his
client
but
he
had
never
had
a
client
who
could
be
more
reasonably
led
on
from
one
outlay
to
another
it
appeared
that
lapham
required
but
to
understand
or
feel
the
beautiful
effect
intended
and
he
was
ready
to
pay
for
it
his
pride
was
concerned
in
a
thing
which
the
architect
made
him
see
and
then
he
believed
that
he
had
seen
it
himself
perhaps
conceived
it
in
some
measure
the
architect
seemed
to
share
his
delusion
and
freely
said
that
lapham
was
very
suggestive
together
they
blocked
out
windows
here
and
bricked
them
up
there
they
changed
doors
and
passages
pulled
down
cornices
and
replaced
them
with
others
of
different
design
experimented
with
costly
devices
of
decoration
and
went
to
extravagant
lengths
in
novelties
of
finish
lapham
beginning
with
a
woman
adventurousness
in
the
unknown
region
took
fright
at
the
reckless
outlay
at
last
and
refused
to
let
her
husband
pass
a
certain
limit
he
tried
to
make
her
believe
that
a
economy
dictated
the
expense
and
that
if
he
put
the
money
into
the
house
he
could
get
it
out
any
time
by
selling
it
she
would
not
be
persuaded
i
do
want
you
should
sell
it
and
you
put
more
money
into
it
now
than
you
ever
get
out
again
unless
you
can
find
as
big
a
goose
to
buy
it
and
that
is
likely
no
sir
you
just
stop
at
a
hundred
thousand
and
do
you
let
him
get
you
a
cent
beyond
why
perfectly
bewitched
with
that
fellow
you
lost
your
head
silas
lapham
and
if
you
do
look
out
you
lose
your
money
too
the
colonel
laughed
he
liked
her
to
talk
that
way
and
promised
he
would
hold
up
a
while
but
there
no
call
to
feel
anxious
pert
it
only
a
question
what
to
do
with
the
money
i
can
reinvest
it
but
i
never
had
so
much
of
it
to
spend
before
spend
it
then
said
his
wife
do
throw
it
away
and
how
came
you
to
have
so
much
more
money
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
silas
lapham
she
added
oh
i
made
a
very
good
thing
in
stocks
lately
in
stocks
when
did
you
take
up
gambling
for
a
living
gambling
stuff
what
gambling
who
said
it
was
gambling
you
have
many
a
time
oh
yes
buying
and
selling
on
a
margin
but
this
was
a
bona
fide
transaction
i
bought
at
for
an
investment
and
i
sold
at
a
hundred
and
seven
and
the
money
passed
both
times
well
you
better
let
stocks
alone
said
his
wife
with
the
conservatism
of
her
sex
next
time
you
buy
at
a
hundred
and
seven
and
sell
at
forty
three
then
where
you
be
left
admitted
the
colonel
you
better
stick
to
paint
a
while
yet
the
colonel
enjoyed
this
too
and
laughed
again
with
the
ease
of
a
man
who
knows
what
he
is
about
a
few
days
after
that
he
came
down
to
nantasket
with
the
radiant
air
which
he
wore
when
he
had
done
a
good
thing
in
business
and
wanted
his
wife
sympathy
he
did
not
say
anything
of
what
had
happened
till
he
was
alone
with
her
in
their
own
room
but
he
was
very
gay
the
whole
evening
and
made
several
jokes
which
penelope
said
nothing
but
very
great
prosperity
could
excuse
they
all
understood
these
moods
of
his
well
what
is
it
silas
asked
his
wife
when
the
time
came
any
more
wanting
to
go
into
the
mineral
paint
business
with
you
something
better
than
that
i
could
think
of
a
good
many
better
things
said
his
wife
with
a
sigh
of
latent
bitterness
what
this
one
i
had
a
visitor
who
ca
you
guess
i
do
want
to
try
who
was
it
rogers
lapham
sat
down
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
stared
at
the
smile
on
her
husband
face
where
he
sat
facing
her
i
guess
you
would
want
to
joke
on
that
subject
si
she
said
a
little
hoarsely
and
you
would
grin
about
it
unless
you
had
some
good
news
i
do
know
what
the
miracle
is
but
if
you
could
tell
quick
she
stopped
like
one
who
can
say
no
more
i
will
persis
said
her
husband
and
with
that
awed
tone
in
which
he
rarely
spoke
of
anything
but
the
virtues
of
his
paint
he
came
to
borrow
money
of
me
and
i
lent
him
it
that
the
short
of
it
the
long
go
on
said
his
wife
with
gentle
patience
well
pert
i
was
never
so
much
astonished
in
my
life
as
i
was
to
see
that
man
come
into
my
office
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
i
do
know
what
i
do
wonder
go
on
and
he
was
as
much
embarrassed
as
i
was
there
we
stood
gaping
at
each
other
and
i
had
hardly
sense
enough
to
ask
him
to
take
a
chair
i
do
know
just
how
we
got
at
it
and
i
do
remember
just
how
it
was
that
he
said
he
came
to
come
to
me
but
he
had
got
hold
of
a
patent
right
that
he
wanted
to
go
into
on
a
large
scale
and
there
he
was
wanting
me
to
supply
him
the
funds
go
on
said
lapham
with
her
voice
further
in
her
throat
i
never
felt
the
way
you
did
about
rogers
but
i
know
how
you
always
did
feel
and
i
guess
i
surprised
him
with
my
answer
he
had
brought
along
a
lot
of
stock
as
security
you
did
take
it
silas
his
wife
flashed
out
yes
i
did
though
said
lapham
you
wait
we
settled
our
business
and
then
we
went
into
the
old
thing
from
the
very
start
and
we
talked
it
all
over
and
when
we
got
through
we
shook
hands
well
i
do
know
when
it
done
me
so
much
good
to
shake
hands
with
anybody
and
you
told
him
you
owned
up
to
him
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
silas
no
i
did
returned
the
colonel
promptly
for
i
was
and
before
we
got
through
i
guess
he
saw
it
the
same
as
i
did
oh
no
matter
so
you
had
the
chance
to
show
how
you
felt
but
i
never
felt
that
way
persisted
the
colonel
i
lent
him
the
money
and
i
kept
his
stocks
and
he
got
what
he
wanted
out
of
me
give
him
back
his
stocks
no
i
sha
rogers
came
to
borrow
he
did
come
to
beg
you
need
be
troubled
about
his
stocks
they
going
to
come
up
in
time
but
just
now
they
so
low
down
that
no
bank
would
take
them
as
security
and
i
got
to
hold
them
till
they
do
rise
i
hope
satisfied
now
persis
said
her
husband
and
he
looked
at
her
with
the
willingness
to
receive
the
reward
of
a
good
action
which
we
all
feel
when
we
have
performed
one
i
lent
him
the
money
you
kept
me
from
spending
on
the
house
truly
si
well
i
satisfied
said
lapham
with
a
deep
tremulous
breath
the
lord
has
been
good
to
you
silas
she
continued
solemnly
you
may
laugh
if
you
choose
and
i
do
know
as
i
believe
in
his
interfering
a
great
deal
but
i
believe
interfered
this
time
and
i
tell
you
silas
it
ai
always
he
gives
people
a
chance
to
make
it
up
to
others
in
this
life
i
been
afraid
you
die
silas
before
you
got
the
chance
but
he
let
you
live
to
make
it
up
to
rogers
i
glad
to
be
let
live
said
lapham
stubbornly
but
i
anything
to
make
up
to
milton
rogers
and
if
god
has
let
me
live
for
that
oh
say
what
you
please
si
say
what
you
please
now
you
done
it
i
sha
stop
you
you
taken
the
one
spot
the
one
speck
off
you
that
was
ever
there
and
i
satisfied
there
ever
any
speck
there
lapham
held
out
lapsing
more
and
more
into
his
vernacular
and
what
i
done
i
done
for
you
persis
and
i
thank
you
for
your
own
soul
sake
silas
i
guess
my
soul
all
right
said
lapham
and
i
want
you
should
promise
me
one
thing
more
thought
you
said
you
were
satisfied
i
am
but
i
want
you
should
promise
me
this
that
you
wo
let
anything
tempt
you
anything
to
ever
trouble
rogers
for
that
money
you
lent
him
no
matter
what
happens
no
matter
if
you
lose
it
all
do
you
promise
why
i
do
ever
expect
to
press
him
for
it
that
what
i
said
to
myself
when
i
lent
it
and
of
course
i
glad
to
have
that
old
trouble
healed
up
i
do
think
i
ever
did
rogers
any
wrong
and
i
never
did
think
so
but
if
i
did
do
it
if
i
did
i
willing
to
call
it
square
if
i
never
see
a
cent
of
my
money
back
again
well
that
all
said
his
wife
they
did
not
celebrate
his
reconciliation
with
his
old
enemy
for
such
they
had
always
felt
him
to
be
since
he
ceased
to
be
an
ally
by
any
show
of
joy
or
affection
it
was
not
in
their
tradition
as
stoical
for
the
woman
as
for
the
man
that
they
should
kiss
or
embrace
each
other
at
such
a
moment
she
was
content
to
have
told
him
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
he
was
content
with
her
saying
that
but
before
she
slept
she
found
words
to
add
that
she
always
feared
the
selfish
part
he
had
acted
toward
rogers
had
weakened
him
and
left
him
less
able
to
overcome
any
temptation
that
might
beset
him
and
that
was
one
reason
why
she
could
never
be
easy
about
it
now
she
should
never
fear
for
him
again
this
time
he
did
not
explicitly
deny
her
forgiving
impeachment
well
it
all
past
and
gone
now
anyway
and
i
do
want
you
should
think
anything
more
about
it
he
was
man
enough
to
take
advantage
of
the
high
favour
in
which
he
stood
when
he
went
up
to
town
and
to
abuse
it
by
bringing
corey
down
to
supper
his
wife
could
not
help
condoning
the
sin
of
disobedience
in
him
at
such
a
time
penelope
said
that
between
the
admiration
she
felt
for
the
colonel
boldness
and
her
mother
forbearance
she
was
hardly
in
a
state
to
entertain
company
that
evening
but
she
did
what
she
could
irene
liked
being
talked
to
better
than
talking
and
when
her
sister
was
by
she
was
always
tacitly
or
explicitly
referring
to
her
for
confirmation
of
what
she
said
she
was
content
to
sit
and
look
pretty
as
she
looked
at
the
young
man
and
listened
to
her
sister
drolling
she
laughed
and
kept
glancing
at
corey
to
make
sure
that
he
was
understanding
her
when
they
went
out
on
the
veranda
to
see
the
moon
on
the
water
penelope
led
the
way
and
irene
followed
they
did
not
look
at
the
moonlight
long
the
young
man
perched
on
the
rail
of
the
veranda
and
irene
took
one
of
the
where
she
could
conveniently
look
at
him
and
at
her
sister
who
sat
leaning
forward
lazily
and
running
on
as
the
phrase
is
that
low
crooning
note
of
hers
was
delicious
her
face
glimpsed
now
and
then
in
the
moonlight
as
she
turned
it
or
lifted
it
a
little
had
a
fascination
which
kept
his
eye
her
talk
was
very
unliterary
and
its
effect
seemed
hardly
conscious
she
was
far
from
epigram
in
her
funning
she
told
of
this
trifle
and
that
she
sketched
the
characters
and
looks
of
people
who
had
interested
her
and
nothing
seemed
to
have
escaped
her
notice
she
mimicked
a
little
but
not
much
she
suggested
and
then
the
affair
represented
itself
as
if
without
her
agency
she
did
not
laugh
when
corey
stopped
she
made
a
soft
cluck
in
her
throat
as
if
she
liked
his
being
amused
and
went
on
again
the
colonel
left
alone
with
his
wife
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
from
town
made
haste
to
take
the
word
well
pert
arranged
the
whole
thing
with
rogers
and
i
hope
you
be
satisfied
to
know
that
he
owes
me
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
that
i
got
security
from
him
to
the
amount
of
a
fourth
of
that
if
i
was
to
force
his
stocks
to
a
sale
how
came
he
to
come
down
with
you
asked
lapham
who
rogers
mr
corey
corey
oh
said
lapham
affecting
not
to
have
thought
she
could
mean
corey
he
proposed
it
likely
jeered
his
wife
but
with
perfect
amiability
it
so
protested
the
colonel
we
got
talking
about
a
matter
just
before
i
left
and
he
walked
down
to
the
boat
with
me
and
then
he
said
if
i
did
mind
he
guessed
he
come
along
down
and
go
back
on
the
return
boat
of
course
i
could
let
him
do
that
it
well
for
you
you
could
and
i
could
do
less
than
bring
him
here
to
tea
oh
certainly
not
but
he
ai
going
to
stay
the
night
unless
faltered
lapham
you
want
him
to
oh
of
course
i
want
him
to
i
guess
he
stay
probably
well
you
know
how
crowded
that
last
boat
always
is
and
he
ca
get
any
other
now
lapham
laughed
at
the
simple
wile
i
hope
you
be
just
as
well
satisfied
si
if
it
turns
out
he
does
want
irene
after
all
pshaw
persis
what
are
you
always
bringing
that
up
for
pleaded
the
colonel
then
he
fell
silent
and
presently
his
rude
strong
face
was
clouded
with
an
unconscious
frown
there
cried
his
wife
startling
him
from
his
abstraction
i
see
how
you
feel
and
i
hope
that
you
remember
who
you
got
to
blame
i
risk
it
said
lapham
with
the
confidence
of
a
man
used
to
success
from
the
veranda
the
sound
of
penelope
lazy
tone
came
through
the
closed
windows
with
joyous
laughter
from
irene
and
peals
from
corey
listen
to
that
said
her
father
within
swelling
up
with
inexpressible
satisfaction
that
girl
can
talk
for
twenty
right
straight
along
she
better
than
a
circus
any
day
i
wonder
what
she
up
to
now
oh
she
probably
getting
off
some
of
those
yarns
of
hers
or
telling
about
some
people
she
ca
step
out
of
the
house
without
coming
back
with
more
things
to
talk
about
than
most
folks
would
bring
back
from
japan
there
ai
a
ridiculous
person
she
ever
seen
but
what
got
something
from
them
to
make
you
laugh
at
and
i
do
believe
ever
had
anybody
in
the
house
since
the
girl
could
talk
that
she
got
some
saying
from
or
some
trick
that
paint
out
you
can
see
and
hear
sometimes
i
want
to
stop
her
but
when
she
gets
into
one
of
her
gales
there
ai
any
standing
up
against
her
i
guess
it
lucky
for
irene
that
she
got
pen
there
to
help
entertain
her
company
i
ca
ever
feel
down
where
pen
is
that
so
said
the
colonel
and
i
guess
she
got
about
as
much
culture
as
any
of
them
do
you
she
reads
a
great
deal
admitted
her
mother
she
seems
to
be
at
it
the
whole
while
i
do
want
she
should
injure
her
health
and
sometimes
i
feel
like
snatchin
the
books
away
from
her
i
do
know
as
it
good
for
a
girl
to
read
so
much
anyway
especially
novels
i
do
want
she
should
get
notions
oh
i
guess
pen
know
how
to
take
care
of
herself
said
lapham
she
got
sense
enough
but
she
ai
so
practical
as
irene
more
up
in
the
clouds
more
of
what
you
may
call
a
dreamer
every
minute
and
i
declare
any
one
to
see
these
two
together
when
there
anything
to
be
done
or
any
lead
to
be
taken
would
say
irene
was
the
oldest
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
only
when
they
get
to
talking
that
you
can
see
pen
got
twice
as
much
brains
well
said
lapham
tacitly
granting
this
point
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
in
supreme
content
did
you
ever
see
much
nicer
girls
anywhere
his
wife
laughed
at
his
pride
i
presume
they
as
much
swans
as
anybody
geese
no
but
honestly
now
oh
they
do
but
do
you
be
silly
if
you
can
help
it
si
the
young
people
came
in
and
corey
said
it
was
time
for
his
boat
lapham
pressed
him
to
stay
but
he
persisted
and
he
would
not
let
the
colonel
send
him
to
the
boat
he
said
he
would
rather
walk
outside
he
pushed
along
toward
the
boat
which
presently
he
could
see
lying
at
her
landing
in
the
bay
across
the
sandy
tract
to
the
left
of
the
hotels
from
time
to
time
he
almost
stopped
in
his
rapid
walk
as
a
man
does
whose
mind
is
in
a
pleasant
tumult
and
then
he
went
forward
at
a
swifter
pace
she
charming
he
said
and
he
thought
he
had
spoken
aloud
he
found
himself
floundering
about
in
the
deep
sand
wide
of
the
path
he
got
back
to
it
and
reached
the
boat
just
before
she
started
the
clerk
came
to
take
his
fare
and
corey
looked
radiantly
up
at
him
in
his
with
a
smile
that
he
must
have
been
wearing
a
long
time
his
cheek
was
stiff
with
it
once
some
people
who
stood
near
him
edged
suddenly
and
fearfully
away
and
then
he
suspected
himself
of
having
laughed
outright
xi
corey
put
off
his
set
smile
with
the
help
of
a
frown
of
which
he
first
became
aware
after
reaching
home
when
his
father
asked
anything
gone
wrong
with
your
department
of
the
fine
arts
tom
oh
no
no
sir
said
the
son
instantly
relieving
his
brows
from
the
strain
upon
them
and
beaming
again
but
i
was
thinking
whether
you
were
not
perhaps
right
in
your
impression
that
it
might
be
well
for
you
to
make
colonel
lapham
acquaintance
before
a
great
while
has
he
been
suggesting
it
in
any
way
asked
bromfield
corey
laying
aside
his
book
and
taking
his
lean
knee
between
his
clasped
hands
oh
not
at
all
the
young
man
hastened
to
reply
i
was
merely
thinking
whether
it
might
not
begin
to
seem
intentional
your
not
doing
it
well
tom
you
know
i
have
been
leaving
it
altogether
to
you
oh
i
understand
of
course
and
i
did
mean
to
urge
anything
of
the
kind
you
are
so
very
much
more
of
a
bostonian
than
i
am
you
know
that
i
been
waiting
your
motion
in
entire
confidence
that
you
would
know
just
what
to
do
and
when
to
do
it
if
i
had
been
left
quite
to
my
own
lawless
impulses
i
think
i
should
have
called
upon
your
padrone
at
once
it
seems
to
me
that
my
father
would
have
found
some
way
of
showing
that
he
expected
as
much
as
that
from
people
placed
in
the
relation
to
him
that
we
hold
to
colonel
lapham
do
you
think
so
asked
the
young
man
yes
but
you
know
i
do
pretend
to
be
an
authority
in
such
matters
as
far
as
they
go
i
am
always
in
the
hands
of
your
mother
and
you
children
i
very
sorry
sir
i
had
no
idea
i
was
your
judgment
i
only
wanted
to
spare
you
a
formality
that
did
seem
quite
a
necessity
yet
i
very
sorry
he
said
again
and
this
time
with
more
comprehensive
regret
i
should
like
to
have
seemed
remiss
with
a
man
who
has
been
so
considerate
of
me
they
are
all
very
i
dare
say
said
bromfield
corey
with
the
satisfaction
which
no
elder
can
help
feeling
in
disabling
the
judgment
of
a
younger
man
that
it
wo
be
too
late
if
i
go
down
to
your
office
with
you
no
no
i
did
imagine
your
doing
it
at
once
sir
ah
but
nothing
can
prevent
me
from
doing
a
thing
when
once
i
take
the
bit
in
my
teeth
said
the
father
with
the
pleasure
which
men
of
weak
will
sometimes
take
in
recognising
their
weakness
how
does
their
new
house
get
on
i
believe
they
expect
to
be
in
it
before
new
year
will
they
be
a
great
addition
to
society
asked
bromfield
corey
with
unimpeachable
seriousness
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
returned
the
son
a
little
uneasily
ah
i
see
that
you
do
tom
no
one
can
help
feeling
that
they
are
all
people
of
good
sense
and
right
ideas
oh
that
wo
do
if
society
took
in
all
the
people
of
right
ideas
and
good
sense
it
would
expand
beyond
the
calling
capacity
of
its
most
active
members
even
your
mother
social
conscientiousness
could
not
compass
it
society
is
a
very
different
sort
of
thing
from
good
sense
and
right
ideas
it
is
based
upon
them
of
course
but
the
airy
graceful
winning
superstructure
which
we
all
know
demands
different
qualities
have
your
friends
got
these
qualities
which
may
be
felt
but
not
defined
the
son
laughed
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
i
do
think
they
have
the
most
elemental
ideas
of
society
as
we
understand
it
i
believe
lapham
ever
gave
a
dinner
and
with
all
that
money
sighed
the
father
i
do
believe
they
have
the
habit
of
wine
at
table
i
suspect
that
when
they
do
drink
tea
and
coffee
with
their
dinner
they
drink
horrible
said
bromfield
corey
it
appears
to
me
that
this
defines
them
oh
yes
there
are
people
who
give
dinners
and
who
are
not
cognoscible
but
people
who
have
never
yet
given
a
dinner
how
is
society
to
assimilate
them
it
digests
a
great
many
people
suggested
the
young
man
yes
but
they
have
always
brought
some
sort
of
sauce
piquante
with
them
now
as
i
understand
you
these
friends
of
yours
have
no
such
sauce
oh
i
do
know
about
that
cried
the
son
oh
rude
native
flavours
i
dare
say
but
that
is
what
i
mean
well
then
they
must
spend
there
is
no
other
way
for
them
to
win
their
way
to
general
regard
we
must
have
the
colonel
elected
to
the
ten
club
and
he
must
put
himself
down
in
the
list
of
those
willing
to
entertain
any
one
can
manage
a
large
supper
yes
i
see
a
gleam
of
hope
for
him
in
that
direction
in
the
morning
bromfield
corey
asked
his
son
whether
he
should
find
lapham
at
his
place
as
early
as
eleven
i
think
you
might
find
him
even
earlier
i
never
been
there
before
him
i
doubt
if
the
porter
is
there
much
sooner
well
suppose
i
go
with
you
then
why
if
you
like
sir
said
the
son
with
some
deprecation
oh
the
question
is
will
he
like
i
think
he
will
sir
and
the
father
could
see
that
his
son
was
very
much
pleased
lapham
was
rending
an
impatient
course
through
the
morning
news
when
they
appeared
at
the
door
of
his
inner
room
he
looked
up
from
the
newspaper
spread
on
the
desk
before
him
and
then
he
stood
up
making
an
indifferent
feint
of
not
knowing
that
he
knew
bromfield
corey
by
sight
good
morning
colonel
lapham
said
the
son
and
lapham
waited
for
him
to
say
further
i
wish
to
introduce
my
father
then
he
answered
good
morning
and
added
rather
sternly
for
the
elder
corey
how
do
you
do
sir
will
you
take
a
chair
and
he
pushed
him
one
they
shook
hands
and
sat
down
and
lapham
said
to
his
subordinate
have
a
seat
but
young
corey
remained
standing
watching
them
in
their
observance
of
each
other
with
an
amusement
which
was
a
little
uneasy
lapham
made
his
visitor
speak
first
by
waiting
for
him
to
do
so
i
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
colonel
lapham
and
i
ought
to
have
come
sooner
to
do
so
my
father
in
your
place
would
have
expected
it
of
a
man
in
my
place
at
once
i
believe
but
i
ca
feel
myself
altogether
a
stranger
as
it
is
i
hope
lapham
is
well
and
your
daughter
thank
you
said
lapham
they
quite
well
they
were
very
kind
to
my
wife
oh
that
was
nothing
cried
lapham
there
nothing
lapham
likes
better
than
a
chance
of
that
sort
corey
and
the
young
ladies
well
very
well
when
i
heard
from
them
they
out
of
town
yes
so
i
understood
said
lapham
with
a
nod
toward
the
son
i
believe
corey
here
told
mrs
lapham
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
stiffly
resolute
to
show
that
he
was
not
incommoded
by
the
exchange
of
these
civilities
yes
said
bromfield
corey
tom
has
had
the
pleasure
which
i
hope
for
of
seeing
you
all
i
hope
you
able
to
make
him
useful
to
you
here
corey
looked
round
lapham
room
vaguely
and
then
out
at
the
clerks
in
their
railed
enclosure
where
his
eye
finally
rested
on
an
extremely
pretty
girl
who
was
operating
a
well
sir
replied
lapham
softening
for
the
first
time
with
this
approach
to
business
i
guess
it
will
be
our
own
fault
if
we
do
by
the
way
corey
he
added
to
the
younger
man
as
he
gathered
up
some
letters
from
his
desk
here
something
in
your
line
spanish
or
french
i
guess
i
run
them
over
said
corey
taking
them
to
his
desk
his
father
made
an
offer
to
rise
do
go
said
lapham
gesturing
him
down
again
i
just
wanted
to
get
him
away
a
minute
i
do
care
to
say
it
to
his
face
i
like
the
principle
but
since
you
ask
me
about
it
i
just
as
lief
say
that
i
never
had
any
young
man
take
hold
here
equal
to
your
son
i
do
know
as
you
care
you
make
me
very
happy
said
bromfield
corey
very
happy
indeed
i
always
had
the
idea
that
there
was
something
in
my
son
if
he
could
only
find
the
way
to
work
it
out
and
he
seems
to
have
gone
into
your
business
for
the
love
of
it
he
went
to
work
in
the
right
way
sir
he
told
me
about
it
he
looked
into
it
and
that
paint
is
a
thing
that
will
bear
looking
into
oh
yes
you
might
think
he
had
invented
it
if
you
heard
him
celebrating
it
is
that
so
demanded
lapham
pleased
through
and
through
well
there
ai
any
other
way
you
got
to
believe
in
a
thing
before
you
can
put
any
heart
in
it
why
i
had
a
partner
in
this
thing
once
along
back
just
after
the
war
and
he
used
to
be
always
wanting
to
tinker
with
something
else
says
i
got
the
best
thing
in
god
universe
now
why
ai
you
satisfied
i
had
to
get
rid
of
him
at
last
i
stuck
to
my
paint
and
that
fellow
drifted
round
pretty
much
all
over
the
whole
country
whittling
his
capital
down
all
the
while
till
here
the
other
day
i
had
to
lend
him
some
money
to
start
him
new
no
sir
you
got
to
believe
in
a
thing
and
i
believe
in
your
son
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
so
far
as
gone
he
a
success
that
very
kind
of
you
no
kindness
about
it
as
i
was
saying
the
other
day
to
a
friend
of
mine
i
had
many
a
fellow
right
out
of
the
street
that
had
to
work
hard
all
his
life
and
did
begin
to
take
hold
like
this
son
of
yours
lapham
expanded
with
profound
as
he
probably
conceived
it
he
had
succeeded
in
praising
in
a
perfectly
casual
way
the
supreme
excellence
of
his
paint
and
his
own
sagacity
and
benevolence
and
here
he
was
sitting
face
to
face
with
bromfield
corey
praising
his
son
to
him
and
receiving
his
grateful
acknowledgments
as
if
he
were
the
father
of
some
whom
lapham
had
given
a
place
half
but
of
charity
yes
sir
when
your
son
proposed
to
take
hold
here
i
did
have
much
faith
in
his
ideas
that
the
truth
but
i
had
faith
in
him
and
i
saw
that
he
meant
business
from
the
start
i
could
see
it
was
born
in
him
any
one
could
i
afraid
he
did
inherit
it
directly
from
me
said
bromfield
corey
but
it
in
the
blood
on
both
sides
well
sir
we
help
those
things
said
lapham
compassionately
some
of
us
have
got
it
and
some
of
us
have
the
idea
is
to
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
got
oh
yes
that
is
the
idea
by
all
means
and
you
ca
ever
tell
what
in
you
till
you
try
why
when
i
started
this
thing
i
did
more
than
half
understand
my
own
strength
i
would
have
said
looking
back
that
i
could
have
stood
the
wear
and
tear
of
what
i
been
through
but
i
developed
as
i
went
along
it
just
like
exercising
your
muscles
in
a
gymnasium
you
can
lift
twice
or
three
times
as
much
after
you
been
in
training
a
month
as
you
could
before
and
i
can
see
that
it
going
to
be
just
so
with
your
son
his
going
through
college
wo
hurt
him
he
soon
slough
all
that
off
and
his
bringing
up
wo
do
be
anxious
about
it
i
noticed
in
the
army
that
some
of
the
fellows
that
had
the
most
were
fellows
that
had
ever
had
much
more
to
do
than
girls
before
the
war
broke
out
your
son
will
get
along
thank
you
said
bromfield
corey
and
smiled
whether
because
his
spirit
was
safe
in
the
humility
he
sometimes
boasted
or
because
it
was
triply
armed
in
pride
against
anything
the
colonel
kindness
could
do
he
get
along
he
a
good
business
man
and
he
a
fine
fellow
must
you
go
asked
lapham
as
bromfield
corey
now
rose
more
resolutely
well
glad
to
see
you
it
was
natural
you
should
want
to
come
and
see
what
he
was
about
and
i
glad
you
did
i
should
have
felt
just
so
about
it
here
is
some
of
our
stuff
he
said
pointing
out
the
various
packages
in
his
office
including
the
persis
brand
ah
that
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
said
his
visitor
that
colour
through
the
jar
very
rich
delicious
is
persis
brand
a
name
lapham
blushed
well
persis
is
i
do
know
as
you
saw
an
interview
that
fellow
published
in
the
events
a
while
back
what
is
the
events
well
it
that
new
paper
witherby
started
no
said
bromfield
corey
i
have
seen
it
i
read
the
daily
he
explained
by
which
he
meant
the
daily
advertiser
the
only
daily
there
is
in
the
bostonian
sense
he
put
a
lot
of
stuff
in
my
mouth
that
i
never
said
resumed
lapham
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
so
long
as
you
have
seen
it
here
the
department
your
son
in
and
he
showed
him
the
foreign
labels
then
he
took
him
out
into
the
warehouse
to
see
the
large
packages
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
where
his
guest
stopped
to
nod
to
his
son
and
say
tom
lapham
insisted
upon
going
down
to
the
lower
door
with
him
well
call
again
he
said
in
hospitable
dismissal
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
there
ai
a
great
deal
doing
at
this
season
bromfield
corey
thanked
him
and
let
his
hand
remain
perforce
in
lapham
lingering
grasp
if
you
ever
like
to
ride
after
a
good
horse
the
colonel
began
oh
no
no
no
thank
you
the
better
the
horse
the
more
i
should
be
scared
tom
has
told
me
of
your
driving
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
colonel
well
every
one
to
his
taste
well
good
morning
sir
and
he
suffered
him
to
go
who
is
the
old
man
blowing
to
this
morning
asked
walker
the
making
an
errand
to
corey
desk
my
father
oh
that
your
father
i
thought
he
must
be
one
of
your
italian
correspondents
that
you
been
showing
round
or
spanish
in
fact
as
bromfield
corey
found
his
way
at
his
leisurely
pace
up
through
the
streets
on
which
the
prosperity
of
his
native
city
was
founded
hardly
any
figure
could
have
looked
more
alien
to
its
life
he
glanced
up
and
down
the
facades
and
through
the
crooked
vistas
like
a
stranger
and
the
swarthy
fruiterer
of
whom
he
bought
an
apple
apparently
for
the
pleasure
of
holding
it
in
his
hand
was
not
surprised
that
the
purchase
should
be
transacted
in
his
own
tongue
lapham
walked
back
through
the
outer
office
to
his
own
room
without
looking
at
corey
and
during
the
day
he
spoke
to
him
only
of
business
matters
that
must
have
been
his
way
of
letting
corey
see
that
he
was
not
overcome
by
the
honour
of
his
father
visit
but
he
presented
himself
at
nantasket
with
the
event
so
perceptibly
on
his
mind
that
his
wife
asked
well
silas
has
rogers
been
borrowing
any
more
money
of
you
i
do
want
you
should
let
that
thing
go
too
far
you
done
enough
you
need
be
afraid
i
seen
the
last
of
rogers
for
one
while
he
hesitated
to
give
the
fact
an
effect
of
no
importance
father
called
this
morning
did
he
said
lapham
willing
to
humour
his
feint
of
indifference
did
he
want
to
borrow
some
money
too
not
as
i
understood
lapham
was
smoking
at
great
ease
and
his
wife
had
some
crocheting
on
the
other
side
of
the
lamp
from
him
the
girls
were
on
the
piazza
looking
at
the
moon
on
the
water
again
there
no
man
in
it
penelope
said
and
irene
laughed
forlornly
what
did
he
want
then
asked
lapham
oh
i
do
know
seemed
to
be
just
a
friendly
call
said
he
ought
to
have
come
before
lapham
was
silent
a
while
then
she
said
well
i
hope
satisfied
now
lapham
rejected
the
sympathy
too
openly
offered
i
do
know
about
being
satisfied
i
in
any
hurry
to
see
him
his
wife
permitted
him
this
pretence
also
what
sort
of
a
person
is
he
anyway
well
not
much
like
his
son
there
no
sort
of
business
about
him
i
do
know
just
how
you
describe
him
he
tall
and
he
got
white
hair
and
a
moustache
and
his
fingers
are
very
long
and
limber
i
could
help
noticing
them
as
he
sat
there
with
his
hands
on
the
top
of
his
cane
did
seem
to
be
dressed
very
much
and
acted
just
like
anybody
did
talk
much
guess
i
did
most
of
the
talking
said
he
was
glad
i
seemed
to
be
getting
along
so
well
with
his
son
he
asked
after
you
and
irene
and
he
said
he
could
feel
just
like
a
stranger
said
you
had
been
very
kind
to
his
wife
of
course
i
turned
it
off
yes
said
lapham
thoughtfully
with
his
hands
resting
on
his
knees
and
his
cigar
between
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
i
guess
he
meant
to
do
the
right
thing
every
way
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
a
much
pleasanter
man
dunno
but
what
he
about
the
pleasantest
man
i
ever
did
see
he
was
not
letting
his
wife
see
in
his
averted
face
the
struggle
that
revealed
itself
there
the
struggle
of
stalwart
achievement
not
to
feel
flattered
at
the
notice
of
sterile
elegance
not
to
be
sneakingly
glad
of
its
amiability
but
to
stand
up
and
look
at
it
with
eyes
on
the
same
level
god
who
made
us
so
much
like
himself
but
out
of
the
dust
alone
knows
when
that
struggle
will
end
the
time
had
been
when
lapham
could
not
have
imagined
any
worldly
splendour
which
his
dollars
could
not
buy
if
he
chose
to
spend
them
for
it
but
his
wife
half
discoveries
taking
form
again
in
his
ignorance
of
the
world
filled
him
with
helpless
misgiving
a
cloudy
vision
of
something
unpurchasable
where
he
had
supposed
there
was
nothing
had
cowed
him
in
spite
of
the
burly
resistance
of
his
pride
i
do
see
why
he
should
be
pleasant
said
lapham
never
done
anything
else
lapham
looked
up
consciously
with
an
uneasy
laugh
pshaw
persis
you
never
forget
anything
oh
i
got
more
than
that
to
remember
i
suppose
you
asked
him
to
ride
after
the
mare
well
said
lapham
reddening
guiltily
he
said
he
was
afraid
of
a
good
horse
then
of
course
you
had
asked
him
lapham
crocheted
in
silence
and
her
husband
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
at
last
he
said
i
going
to
push
that
house
forward
loafing
on
it
there
no
reason
why
we
should
be
in
it
by
thanksgiving
i
do
believe
in
moving
in
the
dead
of
winter
we
can
wait
till
spring
we
very
comfortable
in
the
old
place
answered
his
wife
then
she
broke
out
on
him
what
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
into
that
house
for
do
you
want
to
invite
the
coreys
to
a
lapham
looked
at
her
without
speaking
do
you
suppose
i
can
see
through
you
i
declare
silas
lapham
if
i
did
know
different
i
should
say
you
were
about
the
biggest
fool
do
you
know
anything
do
you
know
that
it
would
do
to
ask
those
people
to
our
house
before
they
asked
us
to
theirs
laugh
in
our
faces
i
do
believe
they
laugh
in
our
faces
what
the
difference
between
our
asking
them
and
their
asking
us
demanded
the
colonel
sulkily
oh
well
if
you
don
t
see
well
i
do
see
but
i
do
want
to
ask
them
to
the
house
i
suppose
if
i
want
to
i
can
invite
him
down
to
a
fish
dinner
at
taft
lapham
fell
back
in
her
chair
and
let
her
work
drop
in
her
lap
with
that
tckk
in
which
her
sex
knows
how
to
express
utter
contempt
and
despair
what
the
matter
well
if
you
do
such
a
thing
silas
i
never
speak
to
you
again
it
no
use
it
no
use
i
did
think
after
you
behaved
so
well
about
rogers
i
might
trust
you
a
little
but
i
see
i
ca
i
presume
as
long
as
you
live
you
have
to
be
nosed
about
like
a
perfect
i
do
know
what
what
are
you
making
such
a
fuss
about
demanded
lapham
terribly
crestfallen
but
trying
to
pluck
up
a
spirit
i
have
done
anything
yet
i
ca
ask
your
advice
about
anything
any
more
without
having
you
fly
out
confound
it
i
shall
do
as
i
please
after
this
but
as
if
he
could
not
endure
that
contemptuous
atmosphere
he
got
up
and
his
wife
heard
him
in
the
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
of
and
then
heard
him
mount
the
stairs
to
their
room
and
slam
its
door
after
him
do
you
know
what
your
father
wanting
to
do
now
lapham
asked
her
eldest
daughter
who
lounged
into
the
parlour
a
moment
with
her
wrap
stringing
from
her
arm
while
the
younger
went
straight
to
bed
he
wants
to
invite
corey
father
to
a
fish
dinner
at
taft
penelope
was
yawning
with
her
hand
on
her
mouth
she
stopped
and
with
a
laugh
of
amused
expectance
sank
into
a
chair
her
shoulders
shrugged
forward
why
what
in
the
world
has
put
the
colonel
up
to
that
put
him
up
to
it
there
that
fellow
who
ought
have
come
to
see
him
long
ago
drops
into
his
office
this
morning
and
talks
five
minutes
with
him
and
your
father
is
flattered
out
of
his
five
senses
crazy
to
get
in
with
those
people
and
i
shall
have
a
perfect
battle
to
keep
him
within
bounds
well
persis
you
ca
say
but
what
you
began
it
said
penelope
oh
yes
i
began
it
confessed
lapham
pen
she
broke
out
what
do
you
suppose
he
means
by
it
who
corey
father
what
does
the
colonel
think
oh
the
colonel
cried
lapham
she
added
tremulously
perhaps
he
is
right
he
did
seem
to
take
a
fancy
to
her
last
summer
and
now
if
he
called
in
that
way
she
left
her
daughter
to
distribute
the
pronouns
aright
and
resumed
of
course
i
should
have
said
once
that
there
was
any
question
about
it
i
should
have
said
so
last
year
and
i
do
know
what
it
is
keeps
me
from
saying
so
now
i
suppose
i
know
a
little
more
about
things
than
i
did
and
your
being
so
bent
on
it
sets
me
all
in
a
twitter
he
thinks
his
money
can
do
everything
well
i
do
say
but
what
it
can
a
good
many
and
is
as
good
a
child
as
ever
there
was
and
i
do
see
but
what
she
enough
to
suit
any
one
she
too
and
she
is
the
most
capable
girl
i
presume
young
men
do
care
very
much
for
such
things
nowadays
but
there
ai
a
great
many
girls
can
go
right
into
the
kitchen
and
make
such
a
custard
as
she
did
yesterday
and
look
at
the
way
she
does
through
the
whole
house
she
ca
seem
to
go
into
a
room
without
the
things
fly
right
into
their
places
and
if
she
had
to
do
it
she
could
make
all
her
own
dresses
a
great
deal
better
than
them
we
pay
to
do
it
i
do
say
but
what
he
about
as
nice
a
fellow
as
ever
stepped
but
there
ashamed
of
going
on
so
well
mother
said
the
girl
after
a
pause
in
which
she
looked
as
if
a
little
weary
of
the
subject
why
do
you
worry
about
it
if
it
to
be
it
be
and
if
it
is
yes
that
what
i
tell
your
father
but
when
it
comes
to
myself
i
see
how
hard
it
is
for
him
to
rest
quiet
i
afraid
we
shall
all
do
something
we
repent
of
afterwards
well
said
penelope
i
do
intend
to
do
anything
wrong
but
if
i
do
i
promise
not
to
be
sorry
for
it
i
go
that
far
and
i
think
i
would
be
sorry
for
it
beforehand
if
i
were
in
your
place
mother
let
the
colonel
go
on
he
likes
to
manoeuvre
and
he
going
to
hurt
any
one
the
corey
family
can
take
care
of
themselves
i
guess
she
laughed
in
her
throat
drawing
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
enjoying
the
resolution
with
which
her
mother
tried
to
fling
off
the
burden
of
her
anxieties
pen
i
believe
you
right
you
always
do
see
things
in
such
a
light
there
i
do
care
if
he
brings
him
down
every
day
well
said
pen
i
do
believe
would
either
just
so
indifferent
the
colonel
slept
badly
that
night
and
in
the
morning
lapham
came
to
breakfast
without
him
your
father
ai
well
she
reported
he
had
one
of
his
turns
i
should
have
thought
he
had
two
or
three
of
them
said
penelope
by
the
stamping
round
i
heard
is
he
coming
to
breakfast
not
just
yet
said
her
mother
he
asleep
and
he
be
all
right
if
he
gets
his
nap
out
i
do
want
you
girls
should
make
any
great
noise
oh
we
be
quiet
enough
returned
penelope
well
glad
the
colonel
is
sojering
at
first
i
thought
he
might
be
sojering
she
broke
into
a
laugh
and
struggling
indolently
with
it
looked
at
her
sister
you
do
think
it
be
necessary
for
anybody
to
come
down
from
the
office
and
take
orders
from
him
while
he
laid
up
do
you
mother
she
inquired
pen
cried
irene
he
be
well
enough
to
go
up
on
the
ten
boat
said
the
mother
sharply
i
think
papa
works
too
hard
all
through
the
summer
why
do
you
make
him
take
a
rest
mamma
asked
irene
oh
take
a
rest
the
man
slaves
harder
every
year
it
used
to
be
so
that
he
take
a
little
time
off
now
and
then
but
i
declare
he
hardly
ever
seems
to
breathe
now
away
from
his
office
and
this
year
he
says
he
does
intend
to
go
down
to
lapham
except
to
see
after
the
works
for
a
few
days
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
the
man
any
more
seems
as
if
the
more
money
he
got
the
more
he
wanted
to
get
it
scares
me
to
think
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
lost
it
i
know
one
thing
concluded
lapham
he
shall
not
go
back
to
the
office
then
he
wo
go
up
on
the
ten
boat
pen
reminded
her
no
he
wo
you
can
just
drive
over
to
the
hotel
as
soon
as
through
girls
and
telegraph
that
he
not
well
and
wo
be
at
the
office
till
i
not
going
to
have
them
send
anybody
down
here
to
bother
him
that
a
blow
said
pen
i
did
know
but
they
might
send
she
looked
demurely
at
her
sister
dennis
mamma
cried
irene
well
i
declare
there
no
living
with
this
family
any
more
said
penelope
there
pen
be
done
commanded
her
mother
but
perhaps
she
did
not
intend
to
forbid
her
teasing
it
gave
a
pleasant
sort
of
reality
to
the
affair
that
was
in
her
mind
and
made
what
she
wished
appear
not
only
possible
but
probable
lapham
got
up
and
lounged
about
fretting
and
rebelling
as
each
boat
departed
without
him
through
the
day
before
night
he
became
very
cross
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
family
to
soothe
him
and
grumbled
that
he
had
been
kept
from
going
up
to
town
i
might
as
well
have
gone
as
not
he
repeated
till
his
wife
lost
her
patience
well
you
shall
go
silas
if
you
have
to
be
carried
to
the
boat
i
declare
said
penelope
the
colonel
do
pet
worth
a
cent
the
six
boat
brought
corey
the
girls
were
sitting
on
the
piazza
and
irene
saw
him
first
o
pen
she
whispered
with
her
heart
in
her
face
and
penelope
had
no
time
for
mockery
before
he
was
at
the
steps
i
hope
colonel
lapham
is
ill
he
said
and
they
could
hear
their
mother
engaged
in
a
moral
contest
with
their
father
indoors
go
and
put
on
your
coat
i
say
you
shall
it
do
matter
how
he
sees
you
at
the
office
or
not
you
in
a
gentleman
house
now
or
you
ought
to
be
and
you
sha
see
company
in
your
penelope
hurried
in
to
subdue
her
mother
anger
oh
he
very
much
better
thank
you
said
irene
speaking
up
loudly
to
drown
the
noise
of
the
controversy
i
glad
of
that
said
corey
and
when
she
led
him
indoors
the
vanquished
colonel
met
his
visitor
in
a
which
he
was
still
buttoning
up
he
could
not
persuade
himself
at
once
that
corey
had
not
come
upon
some
urgent
business
matter
and
when
he
was
clear
that
he
had
come
out
of
civility
surprise
mingled
with
his
gratification
that
he
should
be
the
object
of
solicitude
to
the
young
man
in
lapham
circle
of
acquaintance
they
complained
when
they
were
sick
but
they
made
no
womanish
inquiries
after
one
another
health
and
certainly
paid
no
visits
of
sympathy
till
matters
were
serious
he
would
have
enlarged
upon
the
particulars
of
his
indisposition
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
do
so
and
after
tea
which
corey
took
with
them
he
would
have
remained
to
entertain
him
if
his
wife
had
not
sent
him
to
bed
she
followed
him
to
see
that
he
took
some
medicine
she
had
prescribed
for
him
but
she
went
first
to
penelope
room
where
she
found
the
girl
with
a
book
in
her
hand
which
she
was
not
reading
you
better
go
down
said
the
mother
i
got
to
go
to
your
father
and
irene
is
all
alone
with
corey
and
i
know
she
be
on
pins
and
needles
without
you
there
to
help
make
it
go
off
she
better
try
to
get
along
without
me
mother
said
penelope
soberly
i
ca
always
be
with
them
well
replied
lapham
then
i
must
there
be
a
perfect
quaker
meeting
down
there
oh
i
guess
will
find
something
to
say
if
you
leave
her
to
herself
or
if
she
do
he
must
it
be
all
right
for
you
to
go
down
when
you
get
ready
but
i
sha
go
till
toward
the
last
if
coming
here
to
see
irene
and
i
do
believe
he
come
on
account
he
wants
to
see
her
and
not
me
if
she
ca
interest
him
alone
perhaps
he
as
well
find
it
out
now
as
any
time
at
any
rate
i
guess
you
better
make
the
experiment
you
know
whether
it
a
success
if
he
comes
again
well
said
the
mother
may
be
you
right
i
go
down
directly
it
does
seem
as
if
he
did
mean
something
after
all
lapham
did
not
hasten
to
return
to
her
guest
in
her
own
girlhood
it
was
supposed
that
if
a
young
man
seemed
to
be
coming
to
see
a
girl
it
was
only
to
suppose
that
he
wished
to
see
her
alone
and
her
life
in
town
had
left
lapham
simple
traditions
in
this
respect
unchanged
she
did
with
her
daughter
as
her
mother
would
have
done
with
her
where
penelope
sat
with
her
book
she
heard
the
continuous
murmur
of
voices
below
and
after
a
long
interval
she
heard
her
mother
descend
she
did
not
read
the
open
book
that
lay
in
her
lap
though
she
kept
her
eyes
fast
on
the
print
once
she
rose
and
almost
shut
the
door
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
then
she
opened
it
wide
again
with
a
air
and
resolutely
went
back
to
her
book
which
again
she
did
not
read
but
she
remained
in
her
room
till
it
was
nearly
time
for
corey
to
return
to
his
boat
when
they
were
alone
again
irene
made
a
feint
of
scolding
her
for
leaving
her
to
entertain
corey
why
did
you
have
a
pleasant
call
asked
penelope
irene
threw
her
arms
round
her
oh
it
was
a
splendid
call
i
suppose
i
could
make
it
go
off
so
well
we
talked
nearly
the
whole
time
about
you
i
do
think
that
was
a
very
interesting
subject
he
kept
asking
about
you
he
asked
everything
you
do
know
how
much
he
thinks
of
you
pen
o
pen
what
do
you
think
made
him
come
do
you
think
he
really
did
come
to
see
how
papa
was
irene
buried
her
face
in
her
sister
neck
penelope
stood
with
her
arms
at
her
side
submitting
well
she
said
i
do
think
he
did
altogether
irene
all
glowing
released
her
do
you
do
you
really
o
pen
do
you
think
he
is
nice
do
you
think
he
handsome
do
you
think
i
behaved
horridly
when
we
first
met
him
this
evening
not
thanking
him
for
coming
i
know
he
thinks
i
no
manners
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
thanking
him
for
coming
to
see
me
ought
i
to
have
asked
him
to
come
again
when
he
said
i
did
i
could
do
you
believe
he
think
i
do
want
him
to
you
believe
he
would
keep
coming
if
he
did
want
to
he
has
kept
coming
a
great
deal
yet
suggested
penelope
no
i
know
he
has
but
if
he
if
he
should
then
i
should
think
he
wanted
to
oh
would
you
would
you
oh
how
good
you
always
are
pen
and
you
always
say
what
you
think
i
wish
there
was
some
one
coming
to
see
you
too
that
all
that
i
do
like
about
it
perhaps
he
was
telling
about
his
friend
there
in
texas
well
said
penelope
his
friend
could
call
often
from
texas
you
need
ask
corey
to
trouble
about
me
i
think
i
can
manage
to
worry
along
if
you
satisfied
oh
i
am
pen
when
do
you
suppose
he
come
again
irene
pushed
some
of
penelope
things
aside
on
the
to
rest
her
elbow
and
talk
at
ease
penelope
came
up
and
put
them
back
well
not
she
said
and
if
that
what
you
sitting
up
for
irene
caught
her
round
the
neck
again
and
ran
out
of
the
room
the
colonel
was
packed
off
on
the
eight
boat
the
next
morning
but
his
recovery
did
not
prevent
corey
from
repeating
his
visit
in
a
week
this
time
irene
came
radiantly
up
to
penelope
room
where
she
had
again
withdrawn
herself
you
must
come
down
pen
she
said
he
asked
if
you
not
well
and
mamma
says
you
got
to
come
after
that
penelope
helped
irene
through
with
her
calls
and
talked
them
over
with
her
far
into
the
night
after
corey
was
gone
but
when
the
impatient
curiosity
of
her
mother
pressed
her
for
some
opinion
of
the
affair
she
said
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
mother
do
he
ever
say
anything
to
you
about
her
praise
her
up
any
he
never
mentioned
irene
to
me
he
has
to
me
either
said
lapham
with
a
sigh
of
trouble
then
what
makes
him
keep
coming
i
ca
tell
you
one
thing
he
says
there
is
a
house
open
in
boston
where
he
acquainted
wait
till
some
of
his
friends
get
back
and
then
if
he
keeps
coming
it
be
time
to
inquire
well
said
the
mother
but
as
the
weeks
passed
she
was
less
and
less
able
to
attribute
corey
visits
to
his
loneliness
in
town
and
turned
to
her
husband
for
comfort
silas
i
do
know
as
we
ought
to
let
young
corey
keep
coming
so
i
do
quite
like
it
with
all
his
family
away
he
of
age
said
the
colonel
he
can
go
where
he
pleases
it
do
matter
whether
his
family
here
or
not
yes
but
if
they
do
want
he
should
come
should
you
feel
just
right
about
letting
him
how
you
going
to
stop
him
i
swear
persis
i
do
know
what
got
over
you
what
is
it
you
did
use
to
be
so
but
to
hear
you
talk
you
think
those
coreys
were
too
good
for
this
world
and
we
fit
for
to
walk
on
i
not
going
to
have
say
we
took
an
advantage
of
their
being
away
and
tolled
him
on
i
should
like
to
hear
say
it
cried
lapham
or
anybody
well
said
his
wife
relinquishing
this
point
of
anxiety
i
make
out
whether
he
cares
anything
for
her
or
not
and
pen
ca
tell
either
or
else
she
wo
oh
i
guess
he
cares
for
her
fast
enough
said
the
colonel
i
ca
make
out
that
he
said
or
done
the
first
thing
to
show
it
well
i
was
better
than
a
year
getting
my
courage
up
oh
that
was
different
said
lapham
in
contemptuous
dismissal
of
the
comparison
and
yet
with
a
certain
fondness
i
guess
if
he
cared
for
her
a
fellow
in
his
position
would
be
long
getting
up
his
courage
to
speak
to
irene
lapham
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
between
them
look
here
persis
once
for
all
now
do
you
ever
let
me
hear
you
say
anything
like
that
again
i
worth
nigh
on
to
a
million
and
made
it
every
cent
myself
and
my
girls
are
the
equals
of
anybody
i
do
care
who
it
is
he
ai
the
fellow
to
take
on
any
airs
but
if
he
ever
tries
it
with
me
i
send
him
to
the
right
about
mighty
quick
i
have
a
talk
with
him
if
no
no
do
do
that
implored
his
wife
i
did
mean
anything
i
do
know
as
i
meant
anything
he
just
as
unassuming
as
he
can
be
and
i
think
irene
a
match
for
anybody
you
just
let
things
go
on
it
be
all
right
you
never
can
tell
how
it
is
with
young
people
perhaps
she
offish
now
you
ai
you
ai
going
to
say
anything
lapham
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
the
more
easily
no
doubt
because
after
his
explosion
he
must
have
perceived
that
his
pride
itself
stood
in
the
way
of
what
his
pride
had
threatened
he
contented
himself
with
his
wife
promise
that
she
would
never
again
present
that
offensive
view
of
the
case
and
she
did
not
remain
without
a
certain
support
in
his
sturdy
xii
corey
returned
with
her
daughters
in
the
early
days
of
october
having
passed
three
or
four
weeks
at
intervale
after
leaving
bar
harbour
they
were
somewhat
browner
than
they
were
when
they
left
town
in
june
but
they
were
not
otherwise
changed
lily
the
elder
of
the
girls
had
brought
back
a
number
of
studies
of
kelp
and
toadstools
with
accessory
rocks
and
rotten
logs
which
she
would
never
finish
up
and
never
show
any
one
knowing
the
slightness
of
their
merit
nanny
the
younger
had
read
a
great
many
novels
with
a
keen
sense
of
their
inaccuracy
as
representations
of
life
and
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
life
with
a
sad
regret
for
its
difference
from
fiction
they
were
both
nice
girls
accomplished
of
course
and
well
enough
looking
but
they
had
met
no
one
at
the
seaside
or
the
mountains
whom
their
taste
would
allow
to
influence
their
fate
and
they
had
come
home
to
the
occupations
they
had
left
with
no
hopes
and
no
fears
to
distract
them
in
the
absence
of
these
they
were
fitted
to
take
the
more
vivid
interest
in
their
brother
affairs
which
they
could
see
weighed
upon
their
mother
mind
after
the
first
hours
of
greeting
oh
it
seems
to
have
been
going
on
and
your
father
has
never
written
a
word
about
it
she
said
shaking
her
head
what
good
would
it
have
done
asked
nanny
who
was
little
and
fair
with
rings
of
light
hair
that
filled
a
very
prettily
she
looked
best
in
a
bonnet
it
would
only
have
worried
you
he
could
not
have
stopped
tom
you
could
when
you
came
home
to
do
it
i
dare
say
papa
did
know
much
about
it
suggested
lily
she
was
a
tall
lean
dark
girl
who
looked
as
if
she
were
not
quite
warm
enough
and
whom
you
always
associated
with
wraps
of
different
aesthetic
effect
after
you
had
once
seen
her
it
is
a
serious
matter
always
to
the
women
of
his
family
when
a
young
man
gives
them
cause
to
suspect
that
he
is
interested
in
some
other
woman
a
or
does
not
enter
the
family
he
need
not
be
caressed
or
made
anything
of
but
the
son
or
wife
has
a
claim
upon
his
mother
and
sisters
which
they
can
not
deny
some
convention
of
their
sex
obliges
them
to
show
her
affection
to
like
or
to
seem
to
like
her
to
take
her
to
their
intimacy
however
odious
she
may
be
to
them
with
the
coreys
it
was
something
more
than
an
affair
of
sentiment
they
were
by
no
means
poor
and
they
were
not
dependent
upon
tom
corey
but
the
mother
had
come
without
knowing
it
to
rely
upon
his
sense
his
advice
in
everything
and
the
sisters
seeing
him
hitherto
so
indifferent
to
girls
had
insensibly
grown
to
regard
him
as
altogether
their
own
till
he
should
be
released
not
by
his
marriage
but
by
theirs
an
event
which
had
not
approached
with
the
lapse
of
time
some
kinds
of
girls
they
believed
that
they
could
readily
have
chosen
a
kind
might
have
taken
him
without
taking
him
from
them
but
this
generosity
could
not
be
hoped
for
in
such
a
girl
as
miss
lapham
perhaps
urged
their
mother
it
would
not
be
so
bad
she
seemed
an
affectionate
little
thing
with
her
mother
without
a
great
deal
of
character
though
she
was
so
capable
about
some
things
oh
she
be
an
affectionate
little
thing
with
tom
too
you
may
be
sure
said
nanny
and
that
characterless
capability
becomes
the
most
in
tense
she
think
we
were
against
her
from
the
beginning
she
has
no
cause
for
that
lily
interposed
and
we
shall
not
give
her
any
yes
we
shall
retorted
nanny
we
ca
help
it
and
if
we
ca
her
own
ignorance
would
be
cause
enough
i
ca
feel
that
she
altogether
ignorant
said
corey
justly
of
course
she
can
read
and
write
admitted
nanny
i
ca
imagine
what
he
finds
to
talk
about
with
her
said
lily
oh
that
very
simple
returned
her
sister
they
talk
about
themselves
with
occasional
references
to
each
other
i
have
heard
people
on
on
the
hotel
piazzas
embroidering
or
knitting
or
tatting
or
something
of
that
kind
and
he
says
she
seems
quite
devoted
to
needlework
and
she
says
yes
she
has
a
perfect
passion
for
it
and
everybody
laughs
at
her
for
it
but
she
ca
help
it
she
always
was
so
from
a
child
and
supposes
she
always
shall
be
with
remote
and
minute
particulars
and
she
ends
by
saying
that
perhaps
he
does
not
like
people
to
tat
or
knit
or
embroider
or
whatever
and
he
says
oh
yes
he
does
what
could
make
her
think
such
a
thing
but
for
his
part
he
likes
boating
rather
better
or
if
you
in
the
woods
camping
then
she
lets
him
take
up
one
corner
of
her
work
and
perhaps
touch
her
fingers
and
that
encourages
him
to
say
that
he
supposes
nothing
could
induce
her
to
drop
her
work
long
enough
to
go
down
on
the
rocks
or
out
among
the
huckleberry
bushes
and
she
puts
her
head
on
one
side
and
says
she
does
know
really
and
then
they
go
and
he
lies
at
her
feet
on
the
rocks
or
picks
huckleberries
and
drops
them
in
her
lap
and
they
go
on
talking
about
themselves
and
comparing
notes
to
see
how
they
differ
from
each
other
and
that
will
do
nanny
said
her
mother
lily
smiled
autumnally
oh
disgusting
disgusting
not
at
all
protested
her
sister
it
very
amusing
when
you
see
it
and
when
you
do
it
it
always
a
mystery
what
people
see
in
each
other
observed
corey
severely
yes
nanny
admitted
but
i
do
know
that
there
is
much
comfort
for
us
in
the
application
no
there
is
said
her
mother
the
most
that
we
can
do
is
to
hope
for
the
best
till
we
know
the
worst
of
course
we
shall
make
the
best
of
the
worst
when
it
comes
yes
and
perhaps
it
would
not
be
so
very
bad
i
was
saying
to
your
father
when
i
was
here
in
july
that
those
things
can
always
be
managed
you
must
face
them
as
if
they
were
nothing
out
of
the
way
and
try
not
to
give
any
cause
for
bitterness
among
ourselves
that
true
but
i
do
believe
in
too
much
resignation
beforehand
it
amounts
to
concession
said
nanny
of
course
we
should
oppose
it
in
all
proper
ways
returned
her
mother
lily
had
ceased
to
discuss
the
matter
in
virtue
of
her
artistic
temperament
she
was
expected
not
to
be
very
practical
it
was
her
mother
and
her
sister
who
managed
submitting
to
the
advice
and
consent
of
corey
what
they
intended
to
do
your
father
wrote
me
that
he
had
called
on
colonel
lapham
at
his
place
of
business
said
corey
seizing
her
first
chance
of
approaching
the
subject
with
her
son
yes
said
corey
a
dinner
was
father
idea
but
he
came
down
to
a
call
at
my
suggestion
oh
said
corey
in
a
tone
of
relief
as
if
the
statement
threw
a
new
light
on
the
fact
that
corey
had
suggested
the
visit
he
said
so
little
about
it
in
his
letter
that
i
did
know
just
how
it
came
about
i
thought
it
was
right
they
should
meet
explained
the
son
and
so
did
father
i
was
glad
that
i
suggested
it
afterward
it
was
extremely
gratifying
to
colonel
lapham
oh
it
was
quite
right
in
every
way
i
suppose
you
have
seen
something
of
the
family
during
the
summer
yes
a
good
deal
i
been
down
at
nantasket
rather
often
corey
let
her
eyes
droop
then
she
asked
are
they
well
yes
except
lapham
himself
now
and
then
i
went
down
once
or
twice
to
see
him
he
has
given
himself
any
vacation
this
summer
he
has
such
a
passion
for
his
business
that
i
fancy
he
finds
it
hard
being
away
from
it
at
any
time
and
he
made
his
new
house
an
excuse
for
staying
oh
yes
his
house
is
it
to
be
something
fine
yes
it
a
beautiful
house
seymour
is
doing
it
then
of
course
it
will
be
very
handsome
i
suppose
the
young
ladies
are
very
much
taken
up
with
it
and
mrs
lapham
lapham
yes
i
do
think
the
young
ladies
care
so
much
about
it
it
must
be
for
them
are
they
ambitious
asked
corey
delicately
feeling
her
way
her
son
thought
a
while
then
he
answered
with
a
smile
no
i
do
really
think
they
are
they
are
unambitious
i
should
say
corey
permitted
herself
a
long
breath
but
her
son
added
it
the
parents
who
are
ambitious
for
them
and
her
respiration
became
shorter
again
yes
she
said
they
very
simple
nice
girls
pursued
corey
i
think
you
like
the
elder
when
you
come
to
know
her
when
you
come
to
know
her
the
words
implied
an
expectation
that
the
two
families
were
to
be
better
acquainted
then
she
is
more
intellectual
than
her
sister
corey
ventured
intellectual
repeated
her
son
no
that
is
the
word
quite
though
she
certainly
has
more
mind
the
younger
seemed
very
sensible
oh
sensible
yes
and
as
practical
as
she
pretty
she
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
and
likes
to
be
doing
them
do
you
think
she
an
extraordinary
beauty
yes
yes
she
is
said
corey
at
some
cost
she
good
too
said
corey
and
perfectly
innocent
and
transparent
i
think
you
will
like
her
the
better
the
more
you
know
her
i
thought
her
very
nice
from
the
beginning
said
the
mother
heroically
and
then
nature
asserted
itself
in
her
but
i
should
be
afraid
that
she
might
perhaps
be
a
little
bit
tiresome
at
last
her
range
of
ideas
seemed
so
extremely
limited
yes
that
what
i
was
afraid
of
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
is
she
interests
you
by
her
very
limitations
you
can
see
the
working
of
her
mind
like
that
of
a
child
she
is
at
all
conscious
even
of
her
beauty
i
do
believe
young
men
can
tell
whether
girls
are
conscious
or
not
said
corey
but
i
am
not
saying
the
miss
laphams
are
not
her
son
sat
musing
with
an
inattentive
smile
on
his
face
what
is
it
oh
nothing
i
was
thinking
of
miss
lapham
and
something
she
was
saying
she
very
droll
you
know
the
elder
sister
yes
you
told
me
that
can
you
see
the
workings
of
her
mind
too
no
she
everything
that
unexpected
corey
fell
into
another
reverie
and
smiled
again
but
he
did
not
offer
to
explain
what
amused
him
and
his
mother
would
not
ask
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
his
admiring
the
girl
so
frankly
she
said
afterward
to
her
husband
that
could
come
naturally
till
after
he
had
spoken
to
her
and
i
feel
sure
that
he
has
yet
you
women
have
risen
yet
it
an
evidence
of
the
backwardness
of
your
sex
to
a
conception
of
the
bismarck
idea
in
diplomacy
if
a
man
praises
one
woman
you
still
think
he
in
love
with
another
do
you
mean
that
because
tom
did
praise
the
elder
sister
so
much
he
has
spoken
to
her
corey
refused
the
consequence
saying
that
it
did
not
follow
besides
he
did
praise
her
you
ought
to
be
glad
that
matters
are
in
such
good
shape
then
at
any
rate
you
can
do
absolutely
nothing
oh
i
know
it
sighed
corey
i
wish
tom
would
be
a
little
opener
with
me
he
as
open
as
it
in
the
nature
of
an
son
to
be
with
his
parents
i
dare
say
if
you
asked
him
plumply
what
he
meant
in
regard
to
the
young
lady
he
would
have
told
you
if
he
knew
why
do
you
think
he
does
know
bromfield
i
not
at
all
sure
he
does
you
women
think
that
because
a
young
man
dangles
after
a
girl
or
girls
he
attached
to
them
it
does
at
all
follow
he
dangles
because
he
must
and
does
know
what
to
do
with
his
time
and
because
they
seem
to
like
it
i
dare
say
that
tom
has
dangled
a
good
deal
in
this
instance
because
there
was
nobody
else
in
town
do
you
really
think
so
i
throw
out
the
suggestion
and
it
strikes
me
that
a
young
lady
could
do
better
than
stay
in
or
near
boston
during
the
summer
most
of
the
young
men
are
here
kept
by
business
through
the
week
with
evenings
available
only
on
the
spot
or
a
few
miles
off
what
was
the
proportion
of
the
sexes
at
the
seashore
and
the
mountains
oh
twenty
girls
at
least
for
even
an
excuse
of
a
man
it
shameful
you
see
i
am
right
in
one
part
of
my
theory
why
should
i
be
right
in
the
rest
i
wish
you
were
and
yet
i
ca
say
that
i
do
those
things
are
very
serious
with
girls
i
should
like
tom
to
have
been
going
to
see
those
people
if
he
meant
nothing
by
it
and
you
would
like
it
if
he
did
you
are
difficult
my
dear
her
husband
pulled
an
open
newspaper
toward
him
from
the
table
i
feel
that
it
would
be
at
all
like
him
to
do
so
said
corey
going
on
to
entangle
herself
in
her
words
as
women
often
do
when
their
ideas
are
perfectly
clear
do
go
to
reading
please
bromfield
i
am
really
worried
about
this
matter
i
must
know
how
much
it
means
i
ca
let
it
go
on
so
i
do
see
how
you
can
rest
easy
without
knowing
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
going
to
become
of
me
when
i
die
and
yet
i
sleep
well
replied
bromfield
corey
putting
his
newspaper
aside
ah
but
this
is
a
very
different
thing
so
much
more
serious
well
what
can
you
do
we
had
this
out
when
you
were
here
in
the
summer
and
you
agreed
with
me
then
that
we
could
do
nothing
the
situation
has
changed
at
all
yes
it
has
it
has
continued
the
same
said
corey
again
expressing
the
fact
by
a
contradiction
in
terms
i
think
i
must
ask
tom
outright
you
know
you
ca
do
that
my
dear
then
why
does
he
tell
us
ah
that
what
he
ca
do
if
he
making
love
to
miss
irene
her
name
i
believe
on
the
american
plan
he
will
tell
us
after
he
has
told
her
that
was
the
way
i
did
do
ignore
our
own
youth
anna
it
was
a
long
while
ago
i
admit
it
was
very
different
said
corey
a
little
shaken
i
do
see
how
i
dare
say
mamma
lapham
knows
whether
tom
is
in
love
with
her
daughter
or
not
and
no
doubt
papa
lapham
knows
it
at
second
hand
but
we
shall
not
know
it
until
the
girl
herself
does
depend
upon
that
your
mother
knew
and
she
told
your
father
but
my
poor
father
knew
nothing
about
it
till
we
were
engaged
and
i
had
been
hanging
about
dangling
as
you
call
it
no
no
you
called
it
that
was
it
i
for
a
year
or
more
the
wife
could
not
refuse
to
be
a
little
consoled
by
the
image
of
her
young
love
which
the
words
conjured
up
however
little
she
liked
its
relation
to
her
son
interest
in
irene
lapham
she
smiled
pensively
then
you
think
it
has
come
to
an
understanding
with
them
yet
an
understanding
oh
probably
an
explanation
then
the
only
logical
inference
from
what
we
been
saying
is
that
it
has
but
i
do
ask
you
to
accept
it
on
that
account
may
i
read
now
my
dear
yes
you
may
read
now
said
corey
with
one
of
those
sighs
which
perhaps
express
a
feminine
sense
of
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
husbands
in
general
rather
than
a
personal
discontent
with
her
own
thank
you
my
dear
then
i
think
i
smoke
too
said
bromfield
corey
lighting
a
cigar
she
left
him
in
peace
and
she
made
no
further
attempt
upon
her
confidence
but
she
was
not
inactive
for
that
reason
she
did
not
of
course
admit
to
herself
and
far
less
to
others
the
motive
with
which
she
went
to
pay
an
early
visit
to
the
laphams
who
had
now
come
up
from
nantasket
to
nankeen
square
she
said
to
her
daughters
that
she
had
always
been
a
little
ashamed
of
using
her
acquaintance
with
them
to
get
money
for
her
charity
and
then
seeming
to
drop
it
besides
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
ought
somehow
to
recognise
the
business
relation
that
tom
had
formed
with
the
father
they
must
not
think
that
his
family
disapproved
of
what
he
had
done
yes
business
is
business
said
nanny
with
a
laugh
do
you
wish
us
to
go
with
you
again
no
i
will
go
alone
this
time
replied
the
mother
with
dignity
her
coupe
now
found
its
way
to
nankeen
square
without
difficulty
and
she
sent
up
a
card
which
lapham
received
in
the
presence
of
her
daughter
penelope
i
presume
i
got
to
see
her
she
gasped
well
do
look
so
guilty
mother
joked
the
girl
you
have
been
doing
anything
so
very
wrong
it
seems
as
if
i
had
i
do
know
what
come
over
me
i
afraid
of
the
woman
before
but
now
i
do
seem
to
feel
as
if
i
could
look
her
in
the
face
he
been
coming
here
of
his
own
accord
and
i
fought
against
his
coming
long
enough
goodness
knows
i
did
want
him
to
come
and
as
far
forth
as
that
goes
we
as
respectable
as
they
are
and
your
father
got
twice
their
money
any
day
we
no
need
to
go
begging
for
their
favour
i
guess
they
were
glad
enough
to
get
him
in
with
your
father
yes
those
are
all
good
points
mother
said
the
girl
and
if
you
keep
saying
them
over
and
count
a
hundred
every
time
before
you
speak
i
guess
you
worry
through
lapham
had
been
fussing
distractedly
with
her
hair
and
ribbons
in
preparation
for
her
encounter
with
corey
she
now
drew
in
a
long
quivering
breath
stared
at
her
daughter
without
seeing
her
and
hurried
downstairs
it
was
true
that
when
she
met
corey
before
she
had
not
been
awed
by
her
but
since
then
she
had
learned
at
least
her
own
ignorance
of
the
world
and
she
had
talked
over
the
things
she
had
misconceived
and
the
things
she
had
shrewdly
guessed
so
much
that
she
could
not
meet
her
on
the
former
footing
of
equality
in
spite
of
as
brave
a
spirit
and
as
good
a
conscience
as
woman
need
have
lapham
cringed
inwardly
and
tremulously
wondered
what
her
visitor
had
come
for
she
turned
from
pale
to
red
and
was
hardly
coherent
in
her
greetings
she
did
not
know
how
they
got
to
where
corey
was
saying
exactly
the
right
things
about
her
son
interest
and
satisfaction
in
his
new
business
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
lapham
reading
her
uneasiness
there
and
making
her
feel
in
spite
of
her
indignant
innocence
that
she
had
taken
a
base
advantage
of
her
in
her
absence
to
get
her
son
away
from
her
and
marry
him
to
irene
then
presently
while
this
was
painfully
revolving
itself
in
lapham
mind
she
was
aware
of
corey
asking
if
she
was
not
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
irene
no
she
out
just
now
said
lapham
i
do
know
just
when
she
be
in
she
went
to
get
a
book
and
here
she
turned
red
again
knowing
that
irene
had
gone
to
get
the
book
because
it
was
one
that
corey
had
spoken
of
oh
i
sorry
said
corey
i
had
hoped
to
see
her
and
your
other
daughter
whom
i
never
met
penelope
asked
lapham
eased
a
little
she
is
at
home
i
will
go
and
call
her
the
laphams
had
not
yet
thought
of
spending
their
superfluity
on
servants
who
could
be
rung
for
they
kept
two
girls
and
a
man
to
look
after
the
furnace
as
they
had
for
the
last
ten
years
if
lapham
had
rung
in
the
parlour
her
second
girl
would
have
gone
to
the
street
door
to
see
who
was
there
she
went
upstairs
for
penelope
herself
and
the
girl
after
some
rebellious
derision
returned
with
her
corey
took
account
of
her
as
penelope
withdrew
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
after
their
introduction
and
sat
down
indolently
submissive
on
the
surface
to
the
tests
to
be
applied
and
following
corey
lead
of
the
conversation
in
her
odd
drawl
you
young
ladies
will
be
glad
to
be
getting
into
your
new
house
she
said
politely
i
do
know
said
penelope
we
so
used
to
this
one
corey
looked
a
little
baffled
but
she
said
sympathetically
of
course
you
will
be
sorry
to
leave
your
old
home
lapham
could
not
help
putting
in
on
behalf
of
her
daughters
i
guess
if
it
was
left
to
the
girls
to
say
we
should
leave
it
at
all
oh
indeed
said
corey
are
they
so
much
attached
but
i
can
quite
understand
it
my
children
would
be
too
if
we
were
to
leave
the
old
place
she
turned
to
penelope
but
you
must
think
of
the
lovely
new
house
and
the
beautiful
position
yes
i
suppose
we
shall
get
used
to
them
too
said
penelope
in
response
to
this
didactic
consolation
oh
i
could
even
imagine
your
getting
very
fond
of
them
pursued
corey
patronisingly
my
son
has
told
me
of
the
lovely
outlook
to
have
over
the
water
he
thinks
you
have
such
a
beautiful
house
i
believe
he
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
all
there
when
he
first
came
home
yes
i
think
he
was
our
first
visitor
he
is
a
great
admirer
of
your
house
said
corey
keeping
her
eyes
very
sharply
however
politely
on
penelope
face
as
if
to
surprise
there
the
secret
of
any
other
great
admiration
of
her
that
might
helplessly
show
itself
yes
said
the
girl
he
been
there
several
times
with
father
and
he
would
be
allowed
to
overlook
any
of
its
good
points
her
mother
took
a
little
more
courage
from
her
daughter
tranquillity
the
girls
make
such
fun
of
their
father
excitement
about
his
building
and
the
way
he
talks
it
into
everybody
oh
indeed
said
corey
with
civil
misunderstanding
and
inquiry
penelope
flushed
and
her
mother
went
on
i
tell
him
he
more
of
a
child
about
it
than
any
of
them
young
people
are
very
philosophical
nowadays
remarked
corey
yes
indeed
said
lapham
i
tell
them
they
always
had
everything
so
that
nothing
a
surprise
to
them
it
was
different
with
us
in
our
young
days
yes
said
corey
without
assenting
i
mean
the
colonel
and
myself
explained
lapham
oh
yes
yes
said
corey
i
sure
the
former
went
on
rather
helplessly
we
had
to
work
hard
enough
for
everything
we
got
and
so
we
appreciated
it
so
many
things
were
not
done
for
young
people
then
said
corey
not
recognising
the
standpoint
of
lapham
but
i
do
know
that
they
are
always
the
better
for
it
now
she
added
vaguely
but
with
the
satisfaction
we
all
feel
in
uttering
a
just
commonplace
it
rather
hard
living
up
to
blessings
that
you
always
had
said
penelope
yes
replied
corey
distractedly
and
coming
back
to
her
slowly
from
the
virtuous
distance
to
which
she
had
absented
herself
she
looked
at
the
girl
searchingly
again
as
if
to
determine
whether
this
were
a
touch
of
the
drolling
her
son
had
spoken
of
but
she
only
added
you
will
enjoy
the
sunsets
on
the
back
bay
so
much
well
not
unless
they
new
ones
said
penelope
i
do
believe
i
could
promise
to
enjoy
any
sunsets
that
i
was
used
to
a
great
deal
corey
looked
at
her
with
misgiving
hardening
into
dislike
no
she
breathed
vaguely
my
son
spoke
of
the
fine
effect
of
the
lights
about
the
hotel
from
your
cottage
at
nantasket
she
said
to
lapham
yes
they
splendid
exclaimed
that
lady
i
guess
the
girls
went
down
every
night
with
him
to
see
them
from
the
rocks
yes
said
corey
a
little
dryly
and
she
permitted
herself
to
add
he
spoke
of
those
rocks
i
suppose
both
you
young
ladies
spend
a
great
deal
of
your
time
on
them
when
you
there
at
nahant
my
children
were
constantly
on
them
irene
likes
the
rocks
said
penelope
i
do
care
much
about
them
especially
at
night
oh
indeed
i
suppose
you
find
it
quite
as
well
looking
at
the
lights
comfortably
from
the
veranda
no
you
ca
see
them
from
the
house
oh
said
corey
after
a
perceptible
pause
she
turned
to
lapham
i
do
know
what
my
son
would
have
done
for
a
breath
of
sea
air
this
summer
if
you
had
not
allowed
him
to
come
to
nantasket
he
was
willing
to
leave
his
business
long
enough
to
go
anywhere
else
yes
he
a
born
business
man
responded
lapham
enthusiastically
if
it
born
in
you
it
bound
to
come
out
that
what
the
colonel
is
always
saying
about
corey
he
says
born
in
him
to
be
a
business
man
and
he
ca
help
it
she
recurred
to
corey
gladly
because
she
felt
that
she
had
not
said
enough
of
him
when
his
mother
first
spoke
of
his
connection
with
the
business
i
do
believe
she
went
on
excitedly
that
colonel
lapham
has
ever
had
anybody
with
him
that
he
thought
more
of
you
have
all
been
very
kind
to
my
son
said
corey
in
acknowledgment
and
stiffly
bowing
a
little
and
we
feel
greatly
indebted
to
you
very
much
so
at
these
grateful
expressions
lapham
reddened
once
more
and
murmured
that
it
had
been
very
pleasant
to
them
she
was
sure
she
glanced
at
her
daughter
for
support
but
penelope
was
looking
at
corey
who
doubtless
saw
her
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
though
she
went
on
speaking
to
her
mother
i
was
sorry
to
hear
from
him
that
colonel
lapham
had
not
been
quite
well
this
summer
i
hope
he
better
now
oh
yes
indeed
replied
lapham
he
all
right
now
hardly
ever
been
sick
and
he
do
know
how
to
take
care
of
himself
that
all
we
do
any
of
us
we
all
so
well
health
is
a
great
blessing
sighed
corey
yes
so
it
is
how
is
your
oldest
daughter
inquired
lapham
is
she
as
delicate
as
ever
she
seems
to
be
rather
better
since
we
returned
and
now
corey
as
if
forced
to
the
point
said
bunglingly
that
the
young
ladies
had
wished
to
come
with
her
but
had
been
detained
she
based
her
statement
upon
nanny
sarcastic
demand
and
perhaps
seeing
it
topple
a
little
she
rose
hastily
to
get
away
from
its
fall
but
we
shall
hope
for
some
some
other
occasion
she
said
vaguely
and
she
put
on
a
parting
smile
and
shook
hands
with
lapham
and
penelope
and
then
after
some
lingering
commonplaces
got
herself
out
of
the
house
penelope
and
her
mother
were
still
looking
at
each
other
and
trying
to
grapple
with
the
effect
or
purport
of
the
visit
when
irene
burst
in
upon
them
from
the
outside
o
mamma
was
that
corey
carriage
just
drove
away
penelope
answered
with
her
laugh
yes
you
just
missed
the
most
delightful
call
so
easy
and
pleasant
every
way
not
a
bit
stiff
corey
was
so
friendly
she
did
make
one
feel
at
all
as
if
she
bought
me
and
thought
she
given
too
much
and
mother
held
up
her
head
as
if
she
were
all
wool
and
a
yard
wide
and
she
would
just
like
to
have
anybody
deny
it
in
a
few
touches
of
mimicry
she
dashed
off
a
sketch
of
the
scene
her
mother
trepidation
and
corey
repose
and
polite
scrutiny
of
them
both
she
ended
by
showing
how
she
herself
had
sat
huddled
up
in
a
dark
corner
mute
with
fear
if
she
came
to
make
us
say
and
do
the
wrong
thing
she
must
have
gone
away
happy
and
it
a
pity
you
were
here
to
help
irene
i
know
that
i
aimed
to
make
a
bad
impression
but
i
guess
i
succeeded
even
beyond
my
deserts
she
laughed
then
suddenly
she
flashed
out
in
fierce
earnest
if
i
missed
doing
anything
that
could
make
me
as
hateful
to
her
as
she
made
herself
to
me
she
checked
herself
and
began
to
laugh
her
laugh
broke
and
the
tears
started
into
her
eyes
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
what
what
does
it
mean
asked
irene
in
a
daze
lapham
was
still
in
the
chilly
torpor
to
which
corey
call
had
reduced
her
penelope
vehemence
did
not
rouse
her
she
only
shook
her
head
absently
and
said
i
do
know
why
should
pen
care
what
impression
she
made
i
did
suppose
it
would
make
any
difference
to
her
whether
corey
liked
her
or
not
i
did
either
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
just
as
nervous
as
she
could
be
every
minute
of
the
time
i
guess
she
did
like
corey
any
too
well
from
the
start
and
she
could
seem
to
act
like
herself
tell
me
about
it
mamma
said
irene
dropping
into
a
chair
corey
described
the
interview
to
her
husband
on
her
return
home
well
and
what
are
your
inferences
he
asked
they
were
extremely
embarrassed
and
excited
that
is
the
mother
i
do
wish
to
do
her
injustice
but
she
certainly
behaved
consciously
you
made
her
feel
so
i
dare
say
anna
i
can
imagine
how
terrible
you
must
have
been
in
the
character
of
an
accusing
spirit
too
to
say
anything
what
did
you
hint
i
hinted
nothing
said
corey
descending
to
the
weakness
of
defending
herself
but
i
saw
quite
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
girl
is
in
love
with
tom
and
the
mother
knows
it
that
was
very
unsatisfactory
i
supposed
you
went
to
find
out
whether
tom
was
in
love
with
the
girl
was
she
as
pretty
as
ever
i
did
see
her
she
was
not
at
home
i
saw
her
sister
i
do
know
that
i
follow
you
quite
anna
but
no
matter
what
was
the
sister
like
a
thoroughly
disagreeable
young
woman
what
did
she
do
nothing
she
far
too
sly
for
that
but
that
was
the
impression
then
you
did
find
her
so
amusing
as
tom
does
i
found
her
pert
there
no
other
word
for
it
she
says
things
to
puzzle
you
and
put
you
out
ah
that
was
worse
than
pert
anna
that
was
criminal
well
let
us
thank
heaven
the
younger
one
is
so
pretty
corey
did
not
reply
directly
bromfield
she
said
after
a
moment
of
troubled
silence
i
have
been
thinking
over
your
plan
and
i
do
see
why
it
is
the
right
thing
what
is
my
plan
inquired
bromfield
corey
a
dinner
her
husband
began
to
laugh
ah
you
overdid
the
business
and
this
is
reparation
but
corey
hurried
on
with
combined
dignity
and
anxiety
we
ca
ignore
tom
intimacy
with
them
it
amounts
to
that
it
will
probably
continue
even
if
it
merely
a
fancy
and
we
must
seem
to
know
it
whatever
comes
of
it
we
ca
disown
it
they
are
very
simple
unfashionable
people
and
unworldly
but
i
ca
say
that
they
are
offensive
unless
unless
she
added
in
propitiation
of
her
smile
unless
the
father
how
did
you
find
the
father
she
implored
he
will
be
very
entertaining
said
corey
if
you
start
him
on
his
paint
what
was
the
disagreeable
daughter
like
shall
you
have
her
she
little
and
dark
we
must
have
them
all
corey
sighed
then
you
do
think
a
dinner
would
do
oh
yes
i
do
as
you
say
we
ca
disown
tom
relation
to
them
whatever
it
is
we
had
much
better
recognise
it
and
make
the
best
of
the
inevitable
i
think
a
lapham
dinner
would
be
delightful
he
looked
at
her
with
delicate
irony
in
his
voice
and
smile
and
she
fetched
another
sigh
so
deep
and
sore
now
that
he
laughed
outright
perhaps
he
suggested
it
would
be
the
best
way
of
curing
tom
of
his
fancy
if
he
has
one
he
has
been
seeing
her
with
the
dangerous
advantages
which
a
mother
knows
how
to
give
her
daughter
in
the
family
circle
and
with
no
means
of
comparing
her
with
other
girls
you
must
invite
several
other
very
pretty
girls
do
you
really
think
so
bromfield
asked
corey
taking
courage
a
little
that
might
do
but
her
spirits
visibly
sank
again
i
know
any
other
girl
half
so
pretty
well
then
better
bred
she
is
very
very
modest
and
pleasing
well
more
cultivated
tom
does
get
on
with
such
people
oh
you
wish
him
to
marry
her
i
see
no
no
then
you
better
give
the
dinner
to
bring
them
together
to
promote
the
affair
you
know
i
do
want
to
do
that
bromfield
but
i
feel
that
we
must
do
something
if
we
do
it
has
a
clandestine
appearance
it
just
to
them
a
dinner
wo
leave
us
in
any
worse
position
and
may
leave
us
in
a
better
yes
said
corey
after
another
thoughtful
interval
we
must
have
them
have
them
all
it
could
be
very
simple
ah
you
ca
give
a
dinner
under
a
bushel
if
i
take
your
meaning
my
dear
if
we
do
this
at
all
we
must
do
it
as
if
we
were
ashamed
of
it
we
must
ask
people
to
meet
them
yes
sighed
corey
there
are
not
many
people
in
town
yet
she
added
with
relief
that
caused
her
husband
another
smile
there
really
seems
a
sort
of
fatality
about
it
she
concluded
religiously
then
you
had
better
not
struggle
against
it
go
and
reconcile
lily
and
nanny
to
it
as
soon
as
possible
corey
blanched
a
little
but
do
you
think
it
will
be
the
best
thing
bromfield
i
do
indeed
my
dear
the
only
thing
that
shakes
my
faith
in
the
scheme
is
the
fact
that
i
first
suggested
it
but
if
you
have
adopted
it
it
must
be
all
right
anna
i
ca
say
that
i
expected
it
no
said
his
wife
it
would
do
xiii
having
distinctly
given
up
the
project
of
asking
the
laphams
to
dinner
corey
was
able
to
carry
it
out
with
the
courage
of
sinners
who
have
sacrificed
to
virtue
by
frankly
acknowledging
its
superiority
to
their
intended
transgression
she
did
not
question
but
the
laphams
would
come
and
she
only
doubted
as
to
the
people
whom
she
should
invite
to
meet
them
she
opened
the
matter
with
some
trepidation
to
her
daughters
but
neither
of
them
opposed
her
they
rather
looked
at
the
scheme
from
her
own
point
of
view
and
agreed
with
her
that
nothing
had
really
yet
been
done
to
wipe
out
the
obligation
to
the
laphams
helplessly
contracted
the
summer
before
and
strengthened
by
that
application
to
lapham
for
charity
not
only
the
principal
of
their
debt
of
gratitude
remained
but
the
accruing
interest
they
said
what
harm
could
giving
the
dinner
possibly
do
them
they
might
ask
any
or
all
of
their
acquaintance
without
disadvantage
to
themselves
but
it
would
be
perfectly
easy
to
give
the
dinner
just
the
character
they
chose
and
still
flatter
the
ignorance
of
the
laphams
the
trouble
would
be
with
tom
if
he
were
really
interested
in
the
girl
but
he
could
not
say
anything
if
they
made
it
a
family
dinner
he
could
not
feel
anything
they
had
each
turned
in
her
own
mind
as
it
appeared
from
a
comparison
of
ideas
to
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
of
those
cousinships
which
form
the
admiration
and
terror
of
the
adventurer
in
boston
society
he
finds
himself
hemmed
in
and
left
out
at
every
turn
by
ramifications
that
forbid
him
all
hope
of
safe
personality
in
his
comments
on
people
he
is
never
less
secure
than
when
he
hears
some
given
bostonian
denouncing
or
ridiculing
another
if
he
will
be
advised
he
will
guard
himself
from
concurring
in
these
criticisms
however
just
they
appear
for
the
probability
is
that
their
object
is
a
cousin
of
not
more
than
one
remove
from
the
censor
when
the
alien
hears
a
group
of
boston
ladies
calling
one
another
and
speaking
of
all
their
gentlemen
friends
by
the
familiar
abbreviations
of
their
christian
names
he
must
feel
keenly
the
exile
to
which
he
was
born
but
he
is
then
at
least
in
comparatively
little
danger
while
these
latent
and
tacit
cousinships
open
pitfalls
at
every
step
around
him
in
a
society
where
middlesexes
have
married
essexes
and
produced
suffolks
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
these
conditions
however
so
perilous
to
the
foreigner
are
a
source
of
strength
and
security
to
those
native
to
them
an
uncertain
acquaintance
may
be
so
effectually
involved
in
the
meshes
of
such
a
cousinship
as
never
to
be
heard
of
outside
of
it
and
tremendous
stories
are
told
of
people
who
have
spent
a
whole
winter
in
boston
in
a
whirl
of
gaiety
and
who
the
original
guests
of
the
suffolks
discover
upon
reflection
that
they
have
met
no
one
but
essexes
and
middlesexes
corey
brother
james
came
first
into
her
mind
and
she
thought
with
uncommon
toleration
of
the
uncritical
of
his
wife
james
bellingham
had
been
the
adviser
of
her
son
throughout
and
might
be
said
to
have
actively
promoted
his
connection
with
lapham
she
thought
next
of
the
widow
of
her
cousin
henry
bellingham
who
had
let
her
daughter
marry
that
western
steamboat
man
and
was
fond
of
her
she
might
be
expected
at
least
to
endure
the
and
his
family
the
daughters
insisted
so
strongly
upon
son
charles
that
corey
put
him
down
if
he
were
in
town
he
might
be
in
central
america
he
got
on
with
all
sorts
of
people
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
might
stop
at
this
four
laphams
five
coreys
and
four
bellinghams
were
enough
that
makes
thirteen
said
nanny
you
can
have
and
mrs
sewell
yes
that
is
a
good
idea
assented
corey
he
is
our
minister
and
it
is
very
proper
i
do
see
why
you
do
have
robert
chase
it
is
a
pity
he
should
see
her
for
the
colour
i
do
quite
like
the
idea
of
that
said
corey
but
we
can
have
him
too
if
it
wo
make
too
many
the
painter
had
married
into
a
poorer
branch
of
the
coreys
and
his
wife
was
dead
is
there
any
one
else
there
is
miss
kingsbury
we
have
had
her
so
much
she
will
begin
to
think
we
are
using
her
she
wo
mind
she
so
well
then
the
mother
summed
up
there
are
four
laphams
five
coreys
four
bellinghams
one
chase
and
one
kingsbury
fifteen
oh
and
two
sewells
seventeen
ten
ladies
and
seven
gentlemen
it
does
balance
very
well
and
it
too
large
perhaps
some
of
the
ladies
wo
come
suggested
lily
oh
the
ladies
always
come
said
nanny
their
mother
reflected
well
i
will
ask
them
the
ladies
will
refuse
in
time
to
let
us
pick
up
some
gentlemen
somewhere
some
more
artists
why
we
must
have
seymour
the
architect
he
a
bachelor
and
he
building
their
house
tom
says
her
voice
fell
a
little
when
she
mentioned
her
son
name
and
she
told
him
of
her
plan
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
with
evident
misgiving
what
are
you
doing
it
for
mother
he
asked
looking
at
her
with
his
honest
eyes
she
dropped
her
own
in
a
little
confusion
i
wo
do
it
at
all
my
dear
she
said
if
you
do
approve
but
i
thought
you
know
we
have
never
made
any
proper
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
to
us
at
baie
paul
then
in
the
winter
i
ashamed
to
say
i
got
money
from
her
for
a
charity
i
was
interested
in
and
i
hate
the
idea
of
merely
using
people
in
that
way
and
now
your
having
been
at
their
house
this
summer
we
ca
seem
to
disapprove
of
that
and
your
business
relations
to
him
yes
i
see
said
corey
do
you
think
it
amounts
to
a
dinner
why
i
do
know
returned
his
mother
we
shall
have
hardly
any
one
out
of
our
family
connection
well
corey
assented
it
might
do
i
suppose
what
you
wish
is
to
give
them
a
pleasure
why
certainly
do
you
think
they
like
to
come
oh
they
like
to
come
but
whether
it
would
be
a
pleasure
after
they
were
here
is
another
thing
i
should
have
said
that
if
you
wanted
to
have
them
they
would
enjoy
better
being
simply
asked
to
meet
our
own
immediate
family
that
what
i
thought
of
in
the
first
place
but
your
father
seemed
to
think
it
implied
a
social
distrust
of
them
and
we
could
afford
to
have
that
appearance
even
to
ourselves
perhaps
he
was
right
and
besides
it
might
seem
a
little
significant
corey
seemed
inattentive
to
this
consideration
whom
did
you
think
of
asking
his
mother
repeated
the
names
yes
that
would
do
he
said
with
a
vague
dissatisfaction
i
wo
have
it
at
all
if
you
do
wish
tom
oh
yes
have
it
perhaps
you
ought
yes
i
dare
say
it
right
what
did
you
mean
by
a
family
dinner
seeming
significant
his
mother
hesitated
when
it
came
to
that
she
did
not
like
to
recognise
in
his
presence
the
anxieties
that
had
troubled
her
but
i
do
know
she
said
since
she
must
i
should
want
to
give
that
young
girl
or
her
mother
the
idea
that
we
wished
to
make
more
of
the
acquaintance
than
than
you
did
tom
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
did
not
take
her
meaning
but
he
said
oh
yes
of
course
and
corey
in
the
uncertainty
in
which
she
seemed
destined
to
remain
concerning
this
affair
went
off
and
wrote
her
invitation
to
lapham
later
in
the
evening
when
they
again
found
themselves
alone
her
son
said
i
do
think
i
understood
you
mother
in
regard
to
the
laphams
i
think
i
do
now
i
certainly
do
wish
you
to
make
more
of
the
acquaintance
than
i
have
done
it
would
be
right
it
might
be
very
unfortunate
do
give
the
dinner
it
too
late
now
my
son
said
corey
i
sent
my
note
to
lapham
an
hour
ago
her
courage
rose
at
the
trouble
which
showed
in
corey
face
but
do
be
annoyed
by
it
tom
it
is
a
family
dinner
you
know
and
everything
can
be
managed
without
embarrassment
if
we
take
up
the
affair
at
this
point
you
will
seem
to
have
been
merely
acting
for
us
and
they
ca
possibly
understand
anything
more
well
well
let
it
go
i
dare
say
it
all
right
at
any
rate
it
be
helped
now
i
do
wish
to
help
it
tom
said
corey
with
a
cheerfullness
which
the
thought
of
the
laphams
had
never
brought
her
before
i
am
sure
it
is
quite
fit
and
proper
and
we
can
make
them
have
a
very
pleasant
time
they
are
good
inoffensive
people
and
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
not
to
be
afraid
to
show
that
we
have
felt
their
kindness
to
us
and
his
appreciation
of
you
well
consented
corey
the
trouble
that
his
mother
had
suddenly
cast
off
was
in
his
tone
but
she
was
not
sorry
it
was
quite
time
that
he
should
think
seriously
of
his
attitude
toward
these
people
if
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
but
according
to
his
father
theory
had
been
merely
dangling
it
was
a
view
of
her
son
character
that
could
hardly
have
pleased
her
in
different
circumstances
yet
it
was
now
unquestionably
a
consolation
if
not
wholly
a
pleasure
if
she
considered
the
laphams
at
all
it
was
with
the
resignation
which
we
feel
at
the
evils
of
others
even
when
they
have
not
brought
them
on
themselves
lapham
for
her
part
had
spent
the
hours
between
visit
and
her
husband
coming
home
from
business
in
reaching
the
same
conclusion
with
regard
to
corey
and
her
spirits
were
at
the
lowest
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
irene
was
downcast
with
her
penelope
was
purposely
gay
and
the
colonel
was
beginning
after
his
first
plate
of
the
boiled
ham
which
bristling
with
cloves
rounded
its
bulk
on
a
wide
platter
before
him
to
take
note
of
the
surrounding
mood
when
the
jingled
peremptorily
and
the
girl
left
waiting
on
the
table
to
go
and
answer
it
she
returned
at
once
with
a
note
for
lapham
which
she
read
and
then
after
a
helpless
survey
of
her
family
read
again
why
what
is
it
mamma
asked
irene
while
the
colonel
who
had
taken
up
his
for
another
attack
on
the
ham
held
it
drawn
half
across
it
why
i
do
know
what
it
does
mean
answered
lapham
tremulously
and
she
let
the
girl
take
the
note
from
her
irene
ran
it
over
and
then
turned
to
the
name
at
the
end
with
a
joyful
cry
and
a
flush
that
burned
to
the
top
of
her
forehead
then
she
began
to
read
it
once
more
the
colonel
dropped
his
knife
and
frowned
impatiently
and
lapham
said
you
read
it
out
loud
if
you
know
what
to
make
of
it
irene
but
irene
with
a
nervous
scream
of
protest
handed
it
to
her
father
who
performed
the
office
dear
lapham
will
you
and
general
lapham
i
did
know
i
was
a
general
grumbled
lapham
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
be
looking
up
my
back
pay
who
is
it
writes
this
anyway
he
asked
turning
the
letter
over
for
the
signature
oh
never
mind
read
it
through
cried
his
wife
with
a
kindling
glance
of
triumph
at
penelope
and
he
resumed
and
your
daughters
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
dinner
on
thursday
the
at
six
yours
sincerely
anna
b
corey
the
brief
invitation
had
been
spread
over
two
pages
and
the
colonel
had
difficulties
with
the
signature
which
he
did
not
instantly
surmount
when
he
had
made
out
the
name
and
pronounced
it
he
looked
across
at
his
wife
for
an
explanation
i
do
know
what
it
all
means
she
said
shaking
her
head
and
speaking
with
a
pleased
flutter
she
was
here
this
afternoon
and
i
should
have
said
she
had
come
to
see
how
bad
she
could
make
us
feel
i
declare
i
never
felt
so
put
down
in
my
life
by
anybody
why
what
did
she
do
what
did
she
say
lapham
was
ready
in
his
dense
pride
to
resent
any
affront
to
his
blood
but
doubtful
with
the
evidence
of
this
invitation
to
the
contrary
if
any
affront
had
been
offered
lapham
tried
to
tell
him
but
there
was
really
nothing
tangible
and
when
she
came
to
put
it
into
words
she
could
not
make
out
a
case
her
husband
listened
to
her
excited
attempt
and
then
he
said
with
judicial
superiority
i
guess
nobody
been
trying
to
make
you
feel
bad
persis
what
would
she
go
right
home
and
invite
you
to
dinner
for
if
she
acted
the
way
you
say
in
this
view
it
did
seem
improbable
and
lapham
was
shaken
she
could
only
say
penelope
felt
just
the
way
i
did
about
it
lapham
looked
at
the
girl
who
said
oh
i
ca
prove
it
i
begin
to
think
it
never
happened
i
guess
it
did
humph
said
her
father
and
he
sat
frowning
thoughtfully
a
while
ignoring
her
mocking
irony
or
choosing
to
take
her
seriously
you
ca
really
put
your
finger
on
anything
he
said
to
his
wife
and
it
ai
likely
there
is
anything
anyway
she
done
the
proper
thing
by
you
now
lapham
faltered
between
her
lingering
resentment
and
the
appeals
of
her
flattered
vanity
she
looked
from
penelope
impassive
face
to
the
eager
eyes
of
irene
well
just
as
you
say
silas
i
do
know
as
she
was
so
very
bad
i
guess
may
be
she
was
embarrassed
some
that
what
i
told
you
mamma
from
the
start
interrupted
irene
did
i
tell
you
she
did
mean
anything
by
it
it
just
the
way
she
acted
at
baie
paul
when
she
got
well
enough
to
realise
what
you
done
for
her
penelope
broke
into
a
laugh
is
that
her
way
of
showing
her
gratitude
i
sorry
i
did
understand
that
before
irene
made
no
effort
to
reply
she
merely
looked
from
her
mother
to
her
father
with
a
grieved
face
for
their
protection
and
lapham
said
when
we
done
supper
you
answer
her
persis
say
we
come
with
one
exception
said
penelope
what
do
you
mean
demanded
her
father
with
a
mouth
full
of
ham
oh
nothing
of
importance
merely
that
i
not
going
lapham
gave
himself
time
to
swallow
his
morsel
and
his
rising
wrath
went
down
with
it
i
guess
you
change
your
mind
when
the
time
comes
he
said
anyway
persis
you
say
we
all
come
and
then
if
penelope
do
want
to
go
you
can
excuse
her
after
we
get
there
that
the
best
way
none
of
them
apparently
saw
any
reason
why
the
affair
should
not
be
left
in
this
way
or
had
a
sense
of
the
awful
and
binding
nature
of
a
dinner
engagement
if
she
believed
that
penelope
would
not
finally
change
her
mind
and
go
no
doubt
lapham
thought
that
corey
would
easily
excuse
her
absence
she
did
not
find
it
so
simple
a
matter
to
accept
the
invitation
corey
had
said
dear
lapham
but
lapham
had
her
doubts
whether
it
would
not
be
a
servile
imitation
to
say
dear
corey
in
return
and
she
was
tormented
as
to
the
proper
phrasing
throughout
and
the
precise
temperature
which
she
should
impart
to
her
politeness
she
wrote
an
unpractised
uncharacteristic
round
hand
the
same
in
which
she
used
to
set
the
children
copies
at
school
and
she
subscribed
herself
after
some
hesitation
between
her
husband
given
name
and
her
own
yours
truly
s
lapham
penelope
had
gone
to
her
room
without
waiting
to
be
asked
to
advise
or
criticise
but
irene
had
decided
upon
the
paper
and
on
the
whole
lapham
note
made
a
very
decent
appearance
on
the
page
when
the
came
the
colonel
sent
him
out
to
post
it
in
the
box
at
the
corner
of
the
square
he
had
determined
not
to
say
anything
more
about
the
matter
before
the
girls
not
choosing
to
let
them
see
that
he
was
elated
he
tried
to
give
the
effect
of
its
being
an
everyday
sort
of
thing
abruptly
closing
the
discussion
with
his
order
to
lapham
to
accept
but
he
had
remained
swelling
behind
his
newspaper
during
her
prolonged
struggle
with
her
note
and
he
could
no
longer
hide
his
elation
when
irene
followed
her
sister
upstairs
well
pers
he
demanded
what
do
you
say
now
lapham
had
been
sobered
into
something
of
her
former
misgiving
by
her
difficulties
with
her
note
well
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
declare
i
all
mixed
up
about
it
and
i
do
know
as
we
begun
as
we
can
carry
out
in
promising
to
go
i
presume
she
sighed
that
we
can
all
send
some
excuse
at
the
last
moment
if
we
do
want
to
go
i
guess
we
can
carry
out
and
i
guess
we
sha
want
to
send
any
excuse
bragged
the
colonel
if
we
ever
going
to
be
anybody
at
all
we
got
to
go
and
see
how
it
done
i
presume
we
got
to
give
some
sort
of
party
when
we
get
into
the
new
house
and
this
gives
the
chance
to
ask
back
again
you
ca
complain
now
but
what
they
made
the
advances
persis
no
said
lapham
lifelessly
i
wonder
why
they
wanted
to
do
it
oh
i
suppose
it
all
right
she
added
in
deprecation
of
the
anger
with
her
humility
which
she
saw
rising
in
her
husband
face
but
if
it
all
going
to
be
as
much
trouble
as
that
letter
i
rather
be
whipped
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
wear
or
the
girls
either
i
do
wonder
i
heard
that
people
go
to
dinner
in
do
you
suppose
it
the
custom
how
should
i
know
demanded
the
colonel
i
guess
you
got
clothes
enough
any
rate
you
need
fret
about
it
you
just
go
round
to
white
or
jordan
marsh
and
ask
for
a
dinner
dress
i
guess
that
settle
it
they
know
get
some
of
them
imported
dresses
i
see
in
the
window
every
time
i
pass
lots
of
oh
it
ai
the
dress
said
lapham
i
do
suppose
but
what
we
could
get
along
with
that
and
i
want
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
the
children
but
i
do
know
what
we
going
to
talk
about
to
those
people
when
we
get
there
we
have
got
anything
in
common
with
them
oh
i
do
say
they
any
better
she
again
made
haste
to
say
in
arrest
of
her
husband
resentment
i
do
believe
they
are
and
i
do
see
why
they
should
be
and
there
ai
anybody
has
got
a
better
right
to
hold
up
their
head
than
you
have
silas
you
got
plenty
of
money
and
you
made
every
cent
of
it
i
guess
i
should
amounted
to
much
without
you
persis
interposed
lapham
moved
to
this
justice
by
her
praise
oh
do
talk
about
me
protested
the
wife
now
that
you
made
it
all
right
about
rogers
there
ai
a
thing
in
this
world
against
you
but
still
for
all
that
i
can
see
and
i
can
feel
it
when
i
ca
see
it
that
we
different
from
those
people
enough
and
they
excuse
it
i
presume
but
we
too
old
to
learn
to
be
like
them
the
children
ai
said
lapham
shrewdly
no
the
children
ai
admitted
his
wife
and
that
the
only
thing
that
reconciles
me
to
it
you
see
how
pleased
irene
looked
when
i
read
it
yes
she
was
pleased
and
i
guess
penelope
think
better
of
it
before
the
time
comes
oh
yes
we
do
it
for
them
but
whether
we
doing
the
best
thing
for
goodness
knows
i
not
saying
anything
against
him
irene
be
a
lucky
girl
to
get
him
if
she
wants
him
but
there
i
ten
times
rather
she
was
going
to
marry
such
a
fellow
as
you
were
si
that
had
to
make
every
inch
of
his
own
way
and
she
had
to
help
him
it
in
her
lapham
laughed
aloud
for
pleasure
in
his
wife
fondness
but
neither
of
them
wished
that
he
should
respond
directly
to
it
i
guess
if
it
for
me
he
would
have
a
much
easier
time
but
do
you
fret
it
all
coming
out
right
that
dinner
ai
a
thing
for
you
to
be
uneasy
about
it
pass
off
perfectly
easy
and
natural
lapham
did
not
keep
his
courageous
mind
quite
to
the
end
of
the
week
that
followed
it
was
his
theory
not
to
let
corey
see
that
he
was
set
up
about
the
invitation
and
when
the
young
man
said
politely
that
his
mother
was
glad
they
were
able
to
come
lapham
was
very
short
with
him
he
said
yes
he
believed
that
lapham
and
the
girls
were
going
afterward
he
was
afraid
corey
might
not
understand
that
he
was
coming
too
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
subject
again
and
corey
did
not
so
he
let
it
pass
it
worried
him
to
see
all
the
preparation
that
his
wife
and
irene
were
making
and
he
tried
to
laugh
at
them
for
it
and
it
worried
him
to
find
that
penelope
was
making
no
preparation
at
all
for
herself
but
only
helping
the
others
he
asked
her
what
should
she
do
if
she
changed
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
concluded
to
go
and
she
said
she
guessed
she
should
not
change
her
mind
but
if
she
did
she
would
go
to
white
with
him
and
get
him
to
choose
her
an
imported
dress
he
seemed
to
like
them
so
much
he
was
too
proud
to
mention
the
subject
again
to
her
finally
all
that
in
the
house
began
to
scare
him
with
vague
apprehensions
in
regard
to
his
own
dress
as
soon
as
he
had
determined
to
go
an
ideal
of
the
figure
in
which
he
should
go
presented
itself
to
his
mind
he
should
not
wear
any
because
for
one
thing
he
considered
that
a
man
looked
like
a
fool
in
a
and
for
another
thing
he
had
none
had
none
on
principle
he
would
go
in
a
and
black
pantaloons
and
perhaps
a
white
waistcoat
but
a
black
cravat
anyway
but
as
soon
as
he
developed
this
ideal
to
his
family
which
he
did
in
pompous
disdain
of
their
anxieties
about
their
own
dress
they
said
he
should
not
go
so
irene
reminded
him
that
he
was
the
only
person
without
a
at
a
corps
reunion
dinner
which
he
had
taken
her
to
some
years
before
and
she
remembered
feeling
awfully
about
it
at
the
time
lapham
who
would
perhaps
have
agreed
of
herself
shook
her
head
with
misgiving
i
do
see
but
what
you
have
to
get
you
one
si
she
said
i
do
believe
they
ever
go
without
to
a
private
house
he
held
out
openly
but
on
his
way
home
the
next
day
in
a
sudden
panic
he
cast
anchor
before
his
tailor
door
and
got
measured
for
a
after
that
he
began
to
be
afflicted
about
his
concerning
which
he
had
hitherto
been
airily
indifferent
he
tried
to
get
opinion
out
of
his
family
but
they
were
not
so
clear
about
it
as
they
were
about
the
frock
it
ended
in
their
buying
a
book
of
etiquette
which
settled
the
question
adversely
to
a
white
waistcoat
the
author
however
after
being
very
explicit
in
telling
them
not
to
eat
with
their
knives
and
above
all
not
to
pick
their
teeth
with
their
forks
a
thing
which
he
said
no
lady
or
gentleman
ever
did
was
still
far
from
decided
as
to
the
kind
of
cravat
colonel
lapham
ought
to
wear
shaken
on
other
points
lapham
had
begun
to
waver
also
concerning
the
black
cravat
as
to
the
question
of
gloves
for
the
colonel
which
suddenly
flashed
upon
him
one
evening
it
appeared
never
to
have
entered
the
thoughts
of
the
etiquette
man
as
lapham
called
him
other
authors
on
the
same
subject
were
equally
silent
and
irene
could
only
remember
having
heard
in
some
vague
sort
of
way
that
gentlemen
did
not
wear
gloves
so
much
any
more
drops
of
perspiration
gathered
on
lapham
forehead
in
the
anxiety
of
the
debate
he
groaned
and
he
swore
a
little
in
the
compromise
profanity
which
he
used
i
declare
said
penelope
where
she
sat
purblindly
sewing
on
a
bit
of
dress
for
irene
the
colonel
clothes
are
as
much
trouble
as
anybody
why
do
you
go
to
jordan
marsh
and
order
one
of
the
imported
dresses
for
yourself
father
that
gave
them
all
the
relief
of
a
laugh
over
it
the
colonel
joining
in
piteously
he
had
an
awful
longing
to
find
out
from
corey
how
he
ought
to
go
he
formulated
and
repeated
over
to
himself
an
apparently
careless
question
such
as
oh
by
the
way
corey
where
do
you
get
your
gloves
this
would
naturally
lead
to
some
talk
on
the
subject
which
would
if
properly
managed
clear
up
the
whole
trouble
but
lapham
found
that
he
would
rather
die
than
ask
this
question
or
any
question
that
would
bring
up
the
dinner
again
corey
did
not
recur
to
it
and
lapham
avoided
the
matter
with
positive
fierceness
he
shunned
talking
with
corey
at
all
and
suffered
in
grim
silence
one
night
before
they
fell
asleep
his
wife
said
to
him
i
was
reading
in
one
of
those
books
and
i
do
believe
but
what
we
made
a
mistake
if
pen
holds
out
that
she
wo
go
why
demanded
lapham
in
the
dismay
which
beset
him
at
every
fresh
recurrence
to
the
subject
the
book
says
that
it
very
impolite
not
to
answer
a
dinner
invitation
promptly
well
we
done
that
all
right
at
first
i
did
know
but
what
we
had
been
a
little
too
quick
may
be
but
then
it
says
if
you
not
going
that
it
the
height
of
rudeness
not
to
let
them
know
at
once
so
that
they
can
fill
your
place
at
the
table
the
colonel
was
silent
for
a
while
well
i
dumned
he
said
finally
if
there
seems
to
be
any
end
to
this
thing
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
say
no
for
all
of
us
i
wished
a
hundred
times
they
had
asked
us
but
it
too
late
to
think
about
that
now
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
penelope
oh
i
guess
she
go
at
the
last
moment
she
says
she
wo
she
took
a
prejudice
against
corey
that
day
and
she
ca
seem
to
get
over
it
well
then
had
you
better
write
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
up
that
she
ai
coming
lapham
sighed
helplessly
i
should
know
how
to
get
it
in
it
so
late
now
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
the
face
well
then
she
got
to
go
that
all
she
set
she
wo
and
i
set
she
shall
said
lapham
with
the
loud
obstinacy
of
a
man
whose
women
always
have
their
way
lapham
was
not
supported
by
the
sturdiness
of
his
proclamation
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
what
she
knew
she
ought
to
do
about
penelope
and
she
let
matters
drift
after
all
the
child
had
a
right
to
stay
at
home
if
she
did
not
wish
to
go
that
was
what
lapham
felt
and
what
she
said
to
her
husband
next
morning
bidding
him
let
penelope
alone
unless
she
chose
herself
to
go
she
said
it
was
too
late
now
to
do
anything
and
she
must
make
the
best
excuse
she
could
when
she
saw
corey
she
began
to
wish
that
irene
and
her
father
would
go
and
excuse
her
too
she
could
not
help
saying
this
and
then
she
and
lapham
had
some
unpleasant
words
look
here
he
cried
who
wanted
to
go
in
for
these
people
in
the
first
place
did
you
come
home
full
of
last
year
and
want
me
to
sell
out
here
and
move
somewheres
else
because
it
did
seem
to
suit
and
now
you
want
to
put
it
all
on
me
i
ai
going
to
stand
it
hush
said
his
wife
do
you
want
to
raise
the
house
i
did
put
it
on
you
as
you
say
you
took
it
on
yourself
ever
since
that
fellow
happened
to
come
into
the
new
house
that
day
you
been
perfectly
crazy
to
get
in
with
them
and
now
you
so
afraid
you
shall
do
something
wrong
before
you
do
hardly
dare
to
say
your
life
your
own
i
declare
if
you
pester
me
any
more
about
those
gloves
silas
lapham
i
wo
go
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
go
on
my
own
account
he
demanded
furiously
no
she
admitted
of
course
i
do
i
know
very
well
that
doing
it
for
irene
but
for
goodness
gracious
sake
do
worry
our
lives
out
and
make
yourself
a
perfect
before
the
children
with
this
modified
concession
from
her
the
quarrel
closed
in
sullen
silence
on
lapham
part
the
night
before
the
dinner
came
and
the
question
of
his
gloves
was
still
unsettled
and
in
a
fair
way
to
remain
so
he
had
bought
a
pair
so
as
to
be
on
the
safe
side
perspiring
in
company
with
the
young
lady
who
sold
them
and
who
helped
him
try
them
on
at
the
shop
his
nails
were
still
full
of
the
powder
which
she
had
plentifully
peppered
into
them
in
order
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
his
blunt
fingers
but
he
was
uncertain
whether
he
should
wear
them
they
had
found
a
book
at
last
that
said
the
ladies
removed
their
gloves
on
sitting
down
at
table
but
it
said
nothing
about
gentlemen
gloves
he
left
his
wife
where
she
stood
half
at
her
glass
in
her
new
dress
and
went
down
to
his
own
den
beyond
the
parlour
before
he
shut
his
door
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
irene
trailing
up
and
down
before
the
long
mirror
in
her
new
dress
followed
by
the
seamstress
on
her
knees
the
woman
had
her
mouth
full
of
pins
and
from
time
to
time
she
made
irene
stop
till
she
could
put
one
of
the
pins
into
her
train
penelope
sat
in
a
corner
criticising
and
counselling
it
made
lapham
sick
and
he
despised
himself
and
all
his
brood
for
the
trouble
they
were
taking
but
another
glance
gave
him
a
sight
of
the
young
face
in
the
mirror
beautiful
and
radiant
with
happiness
and
his
heart
melted
again
with
paternal
tenderness
and
pride
it
was
going
to
be
a
great
pleasure
to
irene
and
lapham
felt
that
she
was
bound
to
cut
out
anything
there
he
was
vexed
with
penelope
that
she
was
not
going
too
he
would
have
liked
to
have
those
people
hear
her
talk
he
held
his
door
a
little
open
and
listened
to
the
things
she
was
getting
off
there
to
irene
he
showed
that
he
felt
really
hurt
and
disappointed
about
penelope
and
the
girl
mother
made
her
console
him
the
next
evening
before
they
all
drove
away
without
her
you
try
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
it
father
i
guess
you
see
that
it
best
i
did
go
when
you
get
there
irene
need
open
her
lips
and
they
can
all
see
how
pretty
she
is
but
they
would
know
how
smart
i
was
unless
i
talked
and
maybe
then
they
would
this
thrust
at
her
father
simple
vanity
in
her
made
him
laugh
and
then
they
drove
away
and
penelope
shut
the
door
and
went
upstairs
with
her
lips
firmly
shutting
in
a
sob
xiv
the
coreys
were
one
of
the
few
old
families
who
lingered
in
bellingham
place
the
handsome
quiet
old
street
which
the
sympathetic
observer
must
grieve
to
see
abandoned
to
the
dwellings
are
stately
and
tall
and
the
whole
place
wears
an
air
of
aristocratic
seclusion
which
corey
father
might
well
have
thought
assured
when
he
left
her
his
house
there
at
his
death
it
is
one
of
two
evidently
designed
by
the
same
architect
who
built
some
houses
in
a
characteristic
taste
on
beacon
street
opposite
the
common
it
has
a
wooden
portico
with
slender
fluted
columns
which
have
always
been
painted
white
and
which
with
the
delicate
mouldings
of
the
cornice
form
the
sole
and
sufficient
decoration
of
the
street
front
nothing
could
be
simpler
and
nothing
could
be
better
within
the
architect
has
again
indulged
his
preference
for
the
classic
the
roof
of
the
vestibule
wide
and
low
rests
on
marble
columns
slim
and
fluted
like
the
wooden
columns
without
and
an
ample
staircase
climbs
in
a
graceful
easy
curve
from
the
tesselated
pavement
some
carved
venetian
scrigni
stretched
along
the
wall
a
rug
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
otherwise
the
simple
adequacy
of
the
architectural
intention
had
been
respected
and
the
place
looked
bare
to
the
eyes
of
the
laphams
when
they
entered
the
coreys
had
once
kept
a
man
but
when
young
corey
began
his
retrenchments
the
man
had
yielded
to
the
neat
maid
who
showed
the
colonel
into
the
and
asked
the
ladies
to
walk
up
two
flights
he
had
his
charges
from
irene
not
to
enter
the
without
her
mother
and
he
spent
five
minutes
in
getting
on
his
gloves
for
he
had
desperately
resolved
to
wear
them
at
last
when
he
had
them
on
and
let
his
large
fists
hang
down
on
either
side
they
looked
in
the
saffron
tint
which
the
said
his
gloves
should
be
of
like
canvased
hams
he
perspired
with
doubt
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
while
he
waited
on
the
landing
for
lapham
and
irene
to
come
down
from
above
before
going
into
the
he
stood
staring
at
his
hands
now
open
and
now
shut
and
breathing
hard
he
heard
quiet
talking
beyond
the
portiere
within
and
presently
tom
corey
came
out
ah
colonel
lapham
very
glad
to
see
you
lapham
shook
hands
with
him
and
gasped
waiting
for
mis
lapham
to
account
for
his
presence
he
had
not
been
able
to
button
his
right
glove
and
he
now
began
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
assume
to
pull
them
both
off
for
he
saw
that
corey
wore
none
by
the
time
he
had
stuffed
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
his
wife
and
daughter
descended
corey
welcomed
them
very
cordially
too
but
looked
a
little
mystified
lapham
knew
that
he
was
silently
inquiring
for
penelope
and
she
did
not
know
whether
she
ought
to
excuse
her
to
him
first
or
not
she
said
nothing
and
after
a
glance
toward
the
regions
where
penelope
might
conjecturably
be
lingering
he
held
aside
the
portiere
for
the
laphams
to
pass
and
entered
the
room
with
them
lapham
had
decided
against
on
her
own
responsibility
and
had
entrenched
herself
in
the
safety
of
a
black
silk
in
which
she
looked
very
handsome
irene
wore
a
dress
of
one
of
those
shades
which
only
a
woman
or
an
artist
can
decide
to
be
green
or
blue
and
which
to
other
eyes
looks
both
or
neither
according
to
their
degrees
of
ignorance
if
it
was
more
like
a
ball
dress
than
a
dinner
dress
that
might
be
excused
to
the
exquisite
effect
she
trailed
a
delicate
splendour
across
the
carpet
in
her
mother
sombre
wake
and
the
consciousness
of
success
brought
a
vivid
smile
to
her
face
lapham
pallid
with
anxiety
lest
he
should
somehow
disgrace
himself
giving
thanks
to
god
that
he
should
have
been
spared
the
shame
of
wearing
gloves
where
no
one
else
did
but
at
the
same
time
despairing
that
corey
should
have
seen
him
in
them
had
an
unwonted
aspect
of
almost
pathetic
refinement
corey
exchanged
a
quick
glance
of
surprise
and
relief
with
her
husband
as
she
started
across
the
room
to
meet
her
guests
and
in
her
gratitude
to
them
for
being
so
irreproachable
she
threw
into
her
manner
a
warmth
that
people
did
not
always
find
there
general
lapham
she
said
shaking
hands
in
quick
succession
with
lapham
and
irene
and
now
addressing
herself
to
him
no
only
colonel
said
the
honest
man
but
the
lady
did
not
hear
him
she
was
introducing
her
husband
to
lapham
wife
and
daughter
and
bromfield
corey
was
already
shaking
his
hand
and
saying
he
was
very
glad
to
see
him
again
while
he
kept
his
artistic
eye
on
irene
and
apparently
could
not
take
it
off
lily
corey
gave
the
lapham
ladies
a
greeting
which
was
physically
rather
than
socially
cold
and
nanny
stood
holding
irene
hand
in
both
of
hers
a
moment
and
taking
in
her
beauty
and
her
style
with
a
generous
admiration
which
she
could
afford
for
she
was
herself
faultlessly
dressed
in
the
quiet
taste
of
her
city
and
looking
very
pretty
the
interval
was
long
enough
to
let
every
man
present
confide
his
sense
of
irene
beauty
to
every
other
and
then
as
the
party
was
small
corey
made
everybody
acquainted
when
lapham
had
not
quite
understood
he
held
the
person
hand
and
leaning
urbanely
forward
inquired
what
name
he
did
that
because
a
great
man
to
whom
he
had
been
presented
on
the
platform
at
a
public
meeting
had
done
so
to
him
and
he
knew
it
must
be
right
a
little
lull
ensued
upon
the
introductions
and
corey
said
quietly
to
lapham
can
i
send
any
one
to
be
of
use
to
miss
lapham
as
if
penelope
must
be
in
the
lapham
turned
and
the
graceful
forms
in
which
she
had
been
intending
to
excuse
her
daughter
absence
went
out
of
her
head
she
is
upstairs
she
said
at
her
bluntest
as
country
people
are
when
embarrassed
she
did
feel
just
like
coming
i
know
as
she
feeling
very
well
corey
emitted
a
very
small
o
very
small
very
cold
which
began
to
grow
larger
and
hotter
and
to
burn
into
lapham
soul
before
corey
could
add
i
very
sorry
it
nothing
serious
i
hope
robert
chase
the
painter
had
not
come
and
james
bellingham
was
not
there
so
that
the
table
really
balanced
better
without
penelope
but
lapham
could
not
know
this
and
did
not
deserve
to
know
it
corey
glanced
round
the
room
as
if
to
take
account
of
her
guests
and
said
to
her
husband
i
think
we
are
all
here
then
and
he
came
forward
and
gave
his
arm
to
lapham
she
perceived
then
that
in
their
determination
not
to
be
the
first
to
come
they
had
been
the
last
and
must
have
kept
the
others
waiting
for
them
lapham
had
never
seen
people
go
down
to
dinner
before
but
he
knew
that
his
wife
was
distinguished
in
being
taken
out
by
the
host
and
he
waited
in
jealous
impatience
to
see
if
tom
corey
would
offer
his
arm
to
irene
he
gave
it
to
that
big
girl
they
called
miss
kingsbury
and
the
handsome
old
fellow
whom
corey
had
introduced
as
her
cousin
took
irene
out
lapham
was
startled
from
the
misgiving
in
which
this
left
him
by
corey
passing
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
he
made
a
sudden
movement
forward
but
felt
himself
gently
restrained
they
went
out
the
last
of
all
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
submitted
and
when
they
sat
down
he
saw
that
irene
although
she
had
come
in
with
that
bellingham
was
seated
beside
young
corey
after
all
he
fetched
a
long
sigh
of
relief
when
he
sank
into
his
chair
and
felt
himself
safe
from
error
if
he
kept
a
sharp
lookout
and
did
only
what
the
others
did
bellingham
had
certain
habits
which
he
permitted
himself
and
one
of
these
was
tucking
the
corner
of
his
napkin
into
his
collar
he
confessed
himself
an
uncertain
shot
with
a
spoon
and
defended
his
practice
on
the
ground
of
neatness
and
lapham
put
his
napkin
into
his
collar
too
and
then
seeing
that
no
one
but
bellingham
did
it
became
alarmed
and
took
it
out
again
slyly
he
never
had
wine
on
his
table
at
home
and
on
principle
he
was
a
prohibitionist
but
now
he
did
not
know
just
what
to
do
about
the
glasses
at
the
right
of
his
plate
he
had
a
notion
to
turn
them
all
down
as
he
had
read
of
a
politician
doing
at
a
public
dinner
to
show
that
he
did
not
take
wine
but
after
twiddling
with
one
of
them
a
moment
he
let
them
be
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
would
be
a
little
too
conspicuous
and
he
felt
that
every
one
was
looking
he
let
the
servant
fill
them
all
and
he
drank
out
of
each
not
to
appear
odd
later
he
observed
that
the
young
ladies
were
not
taking
wine
and
he
was
glad
to
see
that
irene
had
refused
it
and
that
lapham
was
letting
it
stand
untasted
he
did
not
know
but
he
ought
to
decline
some
of
the
dishes
or
at
least
leave
most
of
some
on
his
plate
but
he
was
not
able
to
decide
he
took
everything
and
ate
everything
he
noticed
that
corey
seemed
to
take
no
more
trouble
about
the
dinner
than
anybody
and
corey
rather
less
he
was
talking
busily
to
lapham
and
lapham
caught
a
word
here
and
there
that
convinced
him
she
was
holding
her
own
he
was
getting
on
famously
himself
with
corey
who
had
begun
with
him
about
his
new
house
he
was
telling
her
all
about
it
and
giving
her
his
ideas
their
conversation
naturally
included
his
architect
across
the
table
lapham
had
been
delighted
and
secretly
surprised
to
find
the
fellow
there
and
at
something
seymour
said
the
talk
spread
suddenly
and
the
pretty
house
he
was
building
for
colonel
lapham
became
the
general
theme
young
corey
testified
to
its
loveliness
and
the
architect
said
laughingly
that
if
he
had
been
able
to
make
a
nice
thing
of
it
he
owed
it
to
the
practical
sympathy
of
his
client
practical
sympathy
is
good
said
bromfield
corey
and
slanting
his
head
confidentially
to
lapham
he
added
does
he
bleed
your
husband
lapham
he
a
terrible
fellow
for
appropriations
lapham
laughed
reddening
consciously
and
said
she
guessed
the
colonel
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
this
struck
lapham
then
draining
his
glass
of
sauterne
as
wonderfully
discreet
in
his
wife
bromfield
corey
leaned
back
in
his
chair
a
moment
well
after
all
you
ca
say
with
all
your
modern
fuss
about
it
that
you
do
much
better
now
than
the
old
fellows
who
built
such
houses
as
this
ah
said
the
architect
nobody
can
do
better
than
well
your
house
is
in
perfect
taste
you
know
i
always
admired
it
and
i
do
think
it
at
all
the
worse
for
being
what
we
done
is
largely
to
go
back
of
the
hideous
style
that
raged
after
they
forgot
how
to
make
this
sort
of
house
but
i
think
we
may
claim
a
better
feeling
for
structure
we
use
better
material
and
more
wisely
and
by
and
by
we
shall
work
out
something
more
characteristic
and
original
with
your
chocolates
and
olives
and
your
clutter
of
all
that
bad
of
course
but
i
do
mean
that
i
do
wish
to
make
you
envious
of
colonel
lapham
and
modesty
prevents
my
saying
that
his
house
is
prettier
though
i
may
have
my
convictions
but
it
better
built
all
the
new
houses
are
better
built
now
your
house
corey
house
interrupted
the
host
with
a
burlesque
haste
in
disclaiming
responsibility
for
it
that
made
them
all
laugh
my
ancestral
halls
are
in
salem
and
i
told
you
could
drive
a
nail
into
their
timbers
in
fact
i
do
know
that
you
would
want
to
do
it
i
should
consider
it
a
species
of
sacrilege
answered
seymour
and
i
shall
be
far
from
pressing
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
against
a
house
of
mrs
corey
this
won
seymour
the
easy
laugh
and
lapham
silently
wondered
that
the
fellow
never
got
off
any
of
those
things
to
him
well
said
corey
you
architects
and
the
musicians
are
the
true
and
only
artistic
creators
all
the
rest
of
us
sculptors
painters
novelists
and
tailors
deal
with
forms
that
we
have
before
us
we
try
to
imitate
we
try
to
represent
but
you
two
sorts
of
artists
create
form
if
you
represent
you
fail
somehow
or
other
you
do
evolve
the
camel
out
of
your
inner
consciousness
i
will
not
deny
the
soft
impeachment
said
the
architect
with
a
modest
air
i
dare
say
and
you
own
that
it
very
handsome
of
me
to
say
this
after
your
unjustifiable
attack
on
corey
property
bromfield
corey
addressed
himself
again
to
lapham
and
the
talk
subdivided
itself
as
before
it
lapsed
so
entirely
away
from
the
subject
just
in
hand
that
lapham
was
left
with
rather
a
good
idea
as
he
thought
it
to
perish
in
his
mind
for
want
of
a
chance
to
express
it
the
only
thing
like
a
recurrence
to
what
they
had
been
saying
was
bromfield
corey
warning
lapham
in
some
connection
that
lapham
lost
against
miss
kingsbury
she
worse
he
was
saying
when
it
comes
to
appropriations
than
seymour
himself
depend
upon
it
lapham
she
will
give
you
no
peace
of
your
mind
now
she
met
you
from
this
out
her
tender
mercies
are
cruel
and
i
leave
you
to
supply
the
content
from
your
own
scriptural
knowledge
beware
of
her
and
all
her
works
she
calls
them
works
of
charity
but
heaven
knows
whether
they
are
it
do
stand
to
reason
that
she
gives
the
poor
all
the
money
she
gets
out
of
people
i
have
my
own
belief
he
gave
it
in
a
whisper
for
the
whole
table
to
hear
that
she
spends
it
for
champagne
and
cigars
lapham
did
not
know
about
that
kind
of
talking
but
miss
kingsbury
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fun
as
much
as
anybody
and
he
laughed
with
the
rest
you
shall
be
asked
to
the
very
next
debauch
of
the
committee
corey
then
you
wo
dare
expose
us
said
miss
kingsbury
i
wonder
you
have
been
down
upon
corey
to
go
to
the
chardon
street
home
and
talk
with
your
indigent
italians
in
their
native
tongue
said
charles
bellingham
i
saw
in
the
transcript
the
other
night
that
you
wanted
some
one
for
the
work
we
did
think
of
corey
replied
miss
kingsbury
but
we
reflected
that
he
probably
would
talk
with
them
at
all
he
would
make
them
keep
still
to
be
sketched
and
forget
all
about
their
wants
upon
the
theory
that
this
was
a
fair
return
for
corey
pleasantry
the
others
laughed
again
there
is
one
charity
said
corey
pretending
superiority
to
miss
kingsbury
point
that
is
so
difficult
i
wonder
it
has
occurred
to
a
lady
of
your
courageous
invention
yes
said
miss
kingsbury
what
is
that
the
occupation
by
deserving
poor
of
neat
habits
of
all
the
beautiful
airy
wholesome
houses
that
stand
empty
the
whole
summer
long
while
their
owners
are
away
in
their
lowly
cots
beside
the
sea
yes
that
is
terrible
replied
miss
kingsbury
with
quick
earnestness
while
her
eyes
grew
moist
i
have
often
thought
of
our
great
cool
houses
standing
useless
here
and
the
thousands
of
poor
creatures
stifling
in
their
holes
and
dens
and
the
little
children
dying
for
wholesome
shelter
how
cruelly
selfish
we
are
that
is
a
very
comfortable
sentiment
miss
kingsbury
said
corey
and
must
make
you
feel
almost
as
if
you
had
thrown
open
no
to
the
whole
north
end
but
i
am
serious
about
this
matter
i
spend
my
summers
in
town
and
i
occupy
my
own
house
so
that
i
can
speak
impartially
and
intelligently
and
i
tell
you
that
in
some
of
my
walks
on
the
hill
and
down
on
the
back
bay
nothing
but
the
surveillance
of
the
local
policeman
prevents
my
offering
personal
violence
to
those
long
rows
of
handsome
brutally
insensible
houses
if
i
were
a
poor
man
with
a
sick
child
pining
in
some
garret
or
cellar
at
the
north
end
i
should
break
into
one
of
them
and
camp
out
on
the
grand
piano
surely
bromfield
said
his
wife
you
do
consider
what
havoc
such
people
would
make
with
the
furniture
of
a
nice
house
that
is
true
answered
corey
with
meek
conviction
i
never
thought
of
that
and
if
you
were
a
poor
man
with
a
sick
child
i
doubt
if
you
have
so
much
heart
for
burglary
as
you
have
now
said
james
bellingham
it
wonderful
how
patient
they
are
said
the
minister
the
spectacle
of
the
hopeless
comfort
the
poor
man
sees
must
be
hard
to
bear
lapham
wanted
to
speak
up
and
say
that
he
had
been
there
himself
and
knew
how
such
a
man
felt
he
wanted
to
tell
them
that
generally
a
poor
man
was
satisfied
if
he
could
make
both
ends
meet
that
he
did
envy
any
one
his
good
luck
if
he
had
earned
it
so
long
as
he
running
under
himself
but
before
he
could
get
the
courage
to
address
the
whole
table
sewell
added
i
suppose
he
do
always
think
of
it
but
some
day
he
will
think
about
it
said
corey
in
fact
we
rather
invite
him
to
think
about
it
in
this
country
my
said
charles
bellingham
with
the
pride
a
man
feels
in
a
mentionably
remarkable
has
no
end
of
fellows
at
work
under
him
out
there
at
omaha
and
he
says
it
the
fellows
from
countries
where
they
been
kept
from
thinking
about
it
that
are
discontented
the
americans
never
make
any
trouble
they
seem
to
understand
that
so
long
as
we
give
unlimited
opportunity
nobody
has
a
right
to
complain
what
do
you
hear
from
leslie
asked
corey
turning
from
these
profitless
abstractions
to
bellingham
you
know
said
that
lady
in
a
lower
tone
that
there
is
another
baby
no
i
had
heard
of
it
yes
a
boy
they
have
named
him
after
his
uncle
yes
said
charles
bellingham
joining
in
he
is
said
to
be
a
noble
boy
and
to
resemble
me
all
boys
of
that
tender
age
are
noble
said
corey
and
look
like
anybody
you
wish
them
to
resemble
is
leslie
still
for
the
of
her
native
boston
she
is
getting
over
it
i
fancy
replied
bellingham
very
much
taken
up
with
blake
enterprises
and
leads
a
very
exciting
life
she
says
she
like
people
who
have
been
home
from
europe
three
years
she
past
the
most
poignant
stage
of
regret
and
has
reached
the
second
when
they
feel
that
they
must
go
again
lapham
leaned
a
little
toward
corey
and
said
of
a
picture
which
he
saw
on
the
wall
opposite
picture
of
your
daughter
i
presume
no
my
daughter
grandmother
it
a
stewart
newton
he
painted
a
great
many
salem
beauties
she
was
a
miss
polly
burroughs
my
daughter
is
like
her
do
you
think
they
both
looked
at
nanny
corey
and
then
at
the
portrait
those
pretty
dresses
are
coming
in
again
i
not
surprised
you
took
it
for
her
the
others
she
referred
to
the
other
portraits
more
or
less
darkling
on
the
walls
are
my
people
mostly
copleys
these
names
unknown
to
lapham
went
to
his
head
like
the
wine
he
was
drinking
they
seemed
to
carry
light
for
the
moment
but
a
film
of
deeper
darkness
followed
he
heard
charles
bellingham
telling
funny
stories
to
irene
and
trying
to
amuse
the
girl
she
was
laughing
and
seemed
very
happy
from
time
to
time
bellingham
took
part
in
the
general
talk
between
the
host
and
james
bellingham
and
miss
kingsbury
and
that
minister
sewell
they
talked
of
people
mostly
it
astonished
lapham
to
hear
with
what
freedom
they
talked
they
discussed
these
persons
unsparingly
james
bellingham
spoke
of
a
man
known
to
lapham
for
his
business
success
and
great
wealth
as
not
a
gentleman
his
cousin
charles
said
he
was
surprised
that
the
fellow
had
kept
from
being
governor
so
long
when
the
latter
turned
from
irene
to
make
one
of
these
excursions
into
the
general
talk
young
corey
talked
to
her
and
lapham
caught
some
words
from
which
it
seemed
that
they
were
speaking
of
penelope
it
vexed
him
to
think
she
had
not
come
she
could
have
talked
as
well
as
any
of
them
she
was
just
as
bright
and
lapham
was
aware
that
irene
was
not
as
bright
though
when
he
looked
at
her
face
triumphant
in
its
young
beauty
and
fondness
he
said
to
himself
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
he
felt
that
he
was
not
holding
up
his
end
of
the
line
however
when
some
one
spoke
to
him
he
could
only
summon
a
few
words
of
reply
that
seemed
to
lead
to
nothing
things
often
came
into
his
mind
appropriate
to
what
they
were
saying
but
before
he
could
get
them
out
they
were
off
on
something
else
they
jumped
about
so
he
could
not
keep
up
but
he
felt
all
the
same
that
he
was
not
doing
himself
justice
at
one
time
the
talk
ran
off
upon
a
subject
that
lapham
had
never
heard
talked
of
before
but
again
he
was
vexed
that
penelope
was
not
there
to
have
her
say
he
believed
that
her
say
would
have
been
worth
hearing
miss
kingsbury
leaned
forward
and
asked
charles
bellingham
if
he
had
read
tears
idle
tears
the
novel
that
was
making
such
a
sensation
and
when
he
said
no
she
said
she
wondered
at
him
it
perfectly
as
you
imagine
from
the
name
but
there
such
a
dear
hero
and
heroine
in
it
who
keep
dying
for
each
other
all
the
way
through
and
making
the
most
wildly
satisfactory
and
unnecessary
sacrifices
for
each
other
you
feel
as
if
you
done
them
yourself
ah
that
the
secret
of
its
success
said
bromfield
corey
it
flatters
the
reader
by
painting
the
characters
colossal
but
with
his
limp
and
stoop
so
that
he
feels
himself
of
their
supernatural
proportions
you
read
it
nanny
yes
said
his
daughter
it
ought
to
have
been
called
slop
silly
slop
oh
not
quite
slop
nanny
pleaded
miss
kingsbury
it
astonishing
said
charles
bellingham
how
we
do
like
the
books
that
go
for
our
and
i
really
suppose
that
you
ca
put
a
more
popular
thing
than
into
a
novel
we
do
like
to
see
people
suffering
sublimely
there
was
talk
some
years
ago
said
james
bellingham
about
novels
going
out
they
just
coming
in
cried
miss
kingsbury
yes
said
sewell
the
minister
and
i
do
think
there
ever
was
a
time
when
they
formed
the
whole
intellectual
experience
of
more
people
they
do
greater
mischief
than
ever
do
be
envious
parson
said
the
host
no
answered
sewell
i
should
be
glad
of
their
help
but
those
novels
with
heroes
and
heroines
in
them
excuse
me
miss
kingsbury
are
ruinous
do
you
feel
like
a
moral
wreck
miss
kingsbury
asked
the
host
but
sewell
went
on
the
novelists
might
be
the
greatest
possible
help
to
us
if
they
painted
life
as
it
is
and
human
feelings
in
their
true
proportion
and
relation
but
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
and
are
altogether
noxious
this
seemed
sense
to
lapham
but
bromfield
corey
asked
but
what
if
life
as
it
is
is
amusing
are
we
to
be
amused
not
to
our
hurt
sturdily
answered
the
minister
and
the
painted
in
most
novels
like
this
slop
silly
slop
suggested
the
proud
father
of
the
inventor
of
the
phrase
yes
is
nothing
but
psychical
suicide
and
is
as
wholly
immoral
as
the
spectacle
of
a
man
falling
upon
his
sword
well
i
do
know
but
you
right
parson
said
the
host
and
the
minister
who
had
apparently
got
upon
a
of
his
careered
onward
in
spite
of
some
tacit
attempts
of
his
wife
to
seize
the
bridle
right
to
be
sure
i
am
right
the
whole
business
of
love
and
and
marrying
is
painted
by
the
novelists
in
a
monstrous
disproportion
to
the
other
relations
of
life
love
is
very
sweet
very
pretty
oh
thank
you
sewell
said
nanny
corey
in
a
way
that
set
them
all
laughing
but
it
the
affair
commonly
of
very
young
people
who
have
not
yet
character
and
experience
enough
to
make
them
interesting
in
novels
it
treated
not
only
as
if
it
were
the
chief
interest
of
life
but
the
sole
interest
of
the
lives
of
two
ridiculous
young
persons
and
it
is
taught
that
love
is
perpetual
that
the
glow
of
a
true
passion
lasts
for
ever
and
that
it
is
sacrilege
to
think
or
act
otherwise
well
but
is
that
true
mr
sewell
pleaded
miss
kingsbury
i
have
known
some
most
estimable
people
who
had
married
a
second
time
said
the
minister
and
then
he
had
the
applause
with
him
lapham
wanted
to
make
some
open
recognition
of
his
good
sense
but
could
not
i
suppose
the
passion
itself
has
been
a
good
deal
changed
said
bromfield
corey
since
the
poets
began
to
idealise
it
in
the
days
of
chivalry
yes
and
it
ought
to
be
changed
again
said
sewell
what
back
i
do
say
that
but
it
ought
to
be
recognised
as
something
natural
and
mortal
and
divine
honours
which
belong
to
righteousness
alone
ought
not
to
be
paid
it
oh
you
ask
too
much
parson
laughed
his
host
and
the
talk
wandered
away
to
something
else
it
was
not
an
elaborate
dinner
but
lapham
was
used
to
having
everything
on
the
table
at
once
and
this
succession
of
dishes
bewildered
him
he
was
afraid
perhaps
he
was
eating
too
much
he
now
no
longer
made
any
pretence
of
not
drinking
his
wine
for
he
was
thirsty
and
there
was
no
more
water
and
he
hated
to
ask
for
any
the
came
and
then
the
fruit
suddenly
corey
rose
and
said
across
the
table
to
her
husband
i
suppose
you
will
want
your
coffee
here
and
he
replied
yes
we
join
you
at
tea
the
ladies
all
rose
and
the
gentlemen
got
up
with
them
lapham
started
to
follow
corey
but
the
other
men
merely
stood
in
their
places
except
young
corey
who
ran
and
opened
the
door
for
his
mother
lapham
thought
with
shame
that
it
was
he
who
ought
to
have
done
that
but
no
one
seemed
to
notice
and
he
sat
down
again
gladly
after
kicking
out
one
of
his
legs
which
had
gone
to
sleep
they
brought
in
cigars
with
coffee
and
bromfield
corey
advised
lapham
to
take
one
that
he
chose
for
him
lapham
confessed
that
he
liked
a
good
cigar
about
as
well
as
anybody
and
corey
said
these
are
new
i
had
an
englishman
here
the
other
day
who
was
smoking
old
cigars
in
the
superstition
that
tobacco
improved
with
age
like
wine
ah
said
lapham
anybody
who
had
ever
lived
off
a
tobacco
country
could
tell
him
better
than
that
with
the
fuming
cigar
between
his
lips
he
felt
more
at
home
than
he
had
before
he
turned
sidewise
in
his
chair
and
resting
one
arm
on
the
back
intertwined
the
fingers
of
both
hands
and
smoked
at
large
ease
james
bellingham
came
and
sat
down
by
him
colonel
lapham
were
you
with
the
vermont
when
they
charged
across
the
river
in
front
of
pickensburg
and
the
rebel
battery
opened
fire
on
them
in
the
water
lapham
slowly
shut
his
eyes
and
slowly
dropped
his
head
for
assent
letting
out
a
white
volume
of
smoke
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
i
thought
so
said
bellingham
i
was
with
the
massachusetts
and
i
forget
that
slaughter
we
were
all
new
to
it
still
perhaps
that
why
it
made
such
an
impression
i
do
know
suggested
charles
bellingham
was
there
anything
much
more
impressive
afterward
i
read
of
it
out
in
missouri
where
i
was
stationed
at
the
time
and
i
recollect
the
talk
of
some
old
army
men
about
it
they
said
that
could
be
beaten
i
do
know
that
it
ever
was
about
one
in
five
of
us
got
out
safe
said
lapham
breaking
his
off
on
the
edge
of
a
plate
james
bellingham
reached
him
a
bottle
of
apollinaris
he
drank
a
glass
and
then
went
on
smoking
they
all
waited
as
if
expecting
him
to
speak
and
then
corey
said
how
incredible
those
things
seem
already
you
gentlemen
know
that
they
happened
but
are
you
still
able
to
believe
it
ah
nobody
feels
that
anything
happened
said
charles
bellingham
the
past
of
one
experience
does
differ
a
great
deal
from
the
past
of
one
knowledge
it
is
much
more
probable
it
really
a
great
deal
less
vivid
than
some
scenes
in
a
novel
that
one
read
when
a
boy
i
not
sure
of
that
said
james
bellingham
well
james
neither
am
i
consented
his
cousin
helping
himself
from
lapham
apollinaris
bottle
there
would
be
very
little
talking
at
dinner
if
one
only
said
the
things
that
one
was
sure
of
the
others
laughed
and
bromfield
corey
remarked
thoughtfully
what
astonishes
the
craven
civilian
in
all
these
things
is
the
abundance
the
superabundance
of
heroism
the
cowards
were
the
exception
the
men
that
were
ready
to
die
the
rule
the
woods
were
full
of
them
said
lapham
without
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
that
a
nice
little
touch
in
school
interposed
charles
bellingham
where
the
girl
says
to
the
fellow
who
was
at
inkerman
should
think
you
would
be
so
proud
of
it
and
he
reflects
a
while
and
says
the
fact
is
you
know
there
were
so
many
of
us
yes
i
remember
that
said
james
bellingham
smiling
for
pleasure
in
it
but
i
do
see
why
you
claim
the
credit
of
being
a
craven
civilian
bromfield
he
added
with
a
friendly
glance
at
his
and
with
the
willingness
boston
men
often
show
to
turn
one
another
good
points
to
the
light
in
company
bred
so
intimately
together
at
school
and
college
and
in
society
they
all
know
these
points
a
man
who
was
out
with
garibaldi
in
continued
james
bellingham
oh
a
little
amateur
corey
interrupted
in
deprecation
but
even
if
you
choose
to
dispute
my
claim
what
has
become
of
all
the
heroism
tom
how
many
club
men
do
you
know
who
would
think
it
sweet
and
fitting
to
die
for
their
country
i
ca
think
of
a
great
many
at
the
moment
sir
replied
the
son
with
the
modesty
of
his
generation
and
i
could
in
said
his
uncle
nevertheless
they
were
there
then
your
theory
is
that
it
the
occasion
that
is
wanting
said
bromfield
corey
but
why
should
civil
service
reform
and
the
resumption
of
specie
payment
and
a
tariff
for
revenue
only
inspire
heroes
they
are
all
good
causes
it
the
occasion
that
wanting
said
james
bellingham
ignoring
the
persiflage
and
i
very
glad
of
it
so
am
i
said
lapham
with
a
depth
of
feeling
that
expressed
itself
in
spite
of
the
haze
in
which
his
brain
seemed
to
float
there
was
a
great
deal
of
the
talk
that
he
could
not
follow
it
was
too
quick
for
him
but
here
was
something
he
was
clear
of
i
do
want
to
see
any
more
men
killed
in
my
time
something
serious
something
sombre
must
lurk
behind
these
words
and
they
waited
for
lapham
to
say
more
but
the
haze
closed
round
him
again
and
he
remained
silent
drinking
apollinaris
we
were
notoriously
reluctant
to
give
up
fighting
said
sewell
the
minister
but
i
incline
to
think
colonel
lapham
and
bellingham
may
be
right
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
the
heroism
again
if
we
have
the
occasion
till
it
comes
we
must
content
ourselves
with
the
generosities
and
sacrifices
they
make
up
in
quantity
what
they
lack
in
quality
perhaps
they
not
so
picturesque
said
bromfield
corey
you
can
paint
a
man
dying
for
his
country
but
you
ca
express
on
canvas
a
man
fulfilling
the
duties
of
a
good
citizen
perhaps
the
novelists
will
get
at
him
by
and
by
suggested
charles
bellingham
if
i
were
one
of
these
fellows
i
should
propose
to
myself
anything
short
of
that
what
the
commonplace
asked
his
cousin
commonplace
the
commonplace
is
just
that
light
impalpable
aerial
essence
which
they
never
got
into
their
confounded
books
yet
the
novelist
who
could
interpret
the
common
feelings
of
commonplace
people
would
have
the
answer
to
riddle
of
the
painful
earth
on
his
tongue
oh
not
so
bad
as
that
i
hope
said
the
host
and
lapham
looked
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
make
out
what
they
were
at
he
had
never
been
so
up
a
tree
before
i
suppose
it
is
well
for
us
to
see
human
nature
at
white
heat
habitually
continued
bromfield
corey
after
a
while
it
would
make
us
vain
of
our
species
many
a
poor
fellow
in
that
war
and
in
many
another
has
gone
into
battle
simply
and
purely
for
his
country
sake
not
knowing
whether
if
he
laid
down
his
life
he
should
ever
find
it
again
or
whether
if
he
took
it
up
hereafter
he
should
take
it
up
in
heaven
or
hell
come
parson
he
said
turning
to
the
minister
what
has
ever
been
conceived
of
omnipotence
of
omniscience
so
sublime
so
divine
as
that
nothing
answered
the
minister
quietly
god
has
never
been
imagined
at
all
but
if
you
suppose
such
a
man
as
that
was
authorised
i
think
it
will
help
you
to
imagine
what
god
must
be
there
sense
in
that
said
lapham
he
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
pulled
his
chair
a
little
toward
the
table
on
which
he
placed
his
ponderous
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
fellow
i
had
in
my
own
company
when
we
first
went
out
we
were
all
privates
to
begin
with
after
a
while
they
elected
me
captain
i
had
the
tavern
stand
and
most
of
knew
me
but
jim
millon
never
got
to
be
anything
more
than
corporal
corporal
when
he
was
killed
the
others
arrested
themselves
in
various
attitudes
of
attention
and
remained
listening
to
lapham
with
an
interest
that
profoundly
flattered
him
now
at
last
he
felt
that
he
was
holding
up
his
end
of
the
rope
i
ca
say
he
went
into
the
thing
from
the
highest
motives
altogether
our
motives
are
always
pretty
badly
mixed
and
when
there
such
a
as
there
was
then
you
ca
tell
which
is
which
i
suppose
jim
millon
wife
was
enough
to
account
for
his
going
herself
she
was
a
pretty
bad
assortment
said
lapham
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
round
at
the
door
to
make
sure
that
it
was
shut
and
she
used
to
lead
jim
one
kind
of
life
well
sir
continued
lapham
synthetising
his
auditors
in
that
form
of
address
that
fellow
used
to
save
every
cent
of
his
pay
and
send
it
to
that
woman
used
to
get
me
to
do
it
for
him
i
tried
to
stop
him
jim
said
i
know
what
she
do
with
it
so
cap
says
he
i
do
know
what
she
do
without
it
and
it
did
keep
her
straight
straight
as
a
string
as
long
as
jim
lasted
seemed
as
if
there
was
something
mysterious
about
it
they
had
a
little
girl
about
as
old
as
my
oldest
girl
and
jim
used
to
talk
to
me
about
her
guess
he
done
it
as
much
for
her
as
for
the
mother
and
he
said
to
me
before
the
last
action
we
went
into
should
like
to
turn
tail
and
run
cap
i
comin
out
o
this
one
but
i
do
suppose
it
would
do
not
for
you
jim
said
i
want
to
live
he
says
and
he
bust
out
crying
right
there
in
my
tent
want
to
live
for
poor
molly
and
zerrilla
that
what
they
called
the
little
one
i
dunno
where
they
got
the
name
ai
ever
had
half
a
chance
and
now
she
doing
better
and
i
believe
we
should
get
along
after
this
he
set
there
cryin
like
a
baby
but
he
no
baby
when
he
went
into
action
i
hated
to
look
at
him
after
it
was
over
not
so
much
because
he
got
a
ball
that
was
meant
for
me
by
a
sharpshooter
he
saw
the
devil
aim
and
he
jumped
to
warn
me
as
because
he
did
look
like
jim
he
looked
like
fun
all
desperate
and
savage
i
guess
he
died
hard
the
story
made
its
impression
and
lapham
saw
it
now
i
say
he
resumed
as
if
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
do
himself
justice
and
say
something
to
heighten
the
effect
his
story
had
produced
at
the
same
time
he
was
aware
of
a
certain
want
of
clearness
he
had
the
idea
but
it
floated
vague
elusive
in
his
brain
he
looked
about
as
if
for
something
to
precipitate
it
in
tangible
shape
apollinaris
asked
charles
bellingham
handing
the
bottle
from
the
other
side
he
had
drawn
his
chair
closer
than
the
rest
to
lapham
and
was
listening
with
great
interest
when
corey
asked
him
to
meet
lapham
he
accepted
gladly
you
know
i
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
anna
since
leslie
affair
we
rather
bound
to
do
it
and
i
think
we
meet
these
practical
fellows
too
little
there
always
something
original
about
them
he
might
naturally
have
believed
that
the
reward
of
his
faith
was
coming
thanks
i
will
take
some
of
this
wine
said
lapham
pouring
himself
a
glass
of
madeira
from
a
black
and
dusty
bottle
caressed
by
a
label
bearing
the
date
of
the
vintage
he
tossed
off
the
wine
unconscious
of
its
preciousness
and
waited
for
the
result
that
cloudiness
in
his
brain
disappeared
before
it
but
a
mere
blank
remained
he
not
only
could
not
remember
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
he
could
not
recall
what
they
had
been
talking
about
they
waited
looking
at
him
and
he
stared
at
them
in
return
after
a
while
he
heard
the
host
saying
shall
we
join
the
ladies
lapham
went
trying
to
think
what
had
happened
it
seemed
to
him
a
long
time
since
he
had
drunk
that
wine
miss
corey
gave
him
a
cup
of
tea
where
he
stood
aloof
from
his
wife
who
was
talking
with
miss
kingsbury
and
sewell
irene
was
with
miss
nanny
corey
he
could
not
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
but
if
penelope
had
come
he
knew
that
she
would
have
done
them
all
credit
he
meant
to
let
her
know
how
he
felt
about
her
behaviour
when
he
got
home
it
was
a
shame
for
her
to
miss
such
a
chance
irene
was
looking
beautiful
as
pretty
as
all
the
rest
of
them
put
together
but
she
was
not
talking
and
lapham
perceived
that
at
a
you
ought
to
talk
he
was
himself
conscious
of
having
talked
very
well
he
now
wore
an
air
of
great
dignity
and
in
conversing
with
the
other
gentlemen
he
used
a
grave
and
weighty
deliberation
some
of
them
wanted
him
to
go
into
the
library
there
he
gave
his
ideas
of
books
he
said
he
had
not
much
time
for
anything
but
the
papers
but
he
was
going
to
have
a
complete
library
in
his
new
place
he
made
an
elaborate
acknowledgment
to
bromfield
corey
of
his
son
kindness
in
suggesting
books
for
his
library
he
said
that
he
had
ordered
them
all
and
that
he
meant
to
have
pictures
he
asked
corey
who
was
about
the
best
american
painter
going
now
i
do
set
up
to
be
a
judge
of
pictures
but
i
know
what
i
like
he
said
he
lost
the
reserve
which
he
had
maintained
earlier
and
began
to
boast
he
himself
introduced
the
subject
of
his
paint
in
a
natural
transition
from
pictures
he
said
corey
must
take
a
run
up
to
lapham
with
him
some
day
and
see
the
works
they
would
interest
him
and
he
would
drive
him
round
the
country
he
kept
most
of
his
horses
up
there
and
he
could
show
corey
some
of
the
finest
jersey
grades
in
the
country
he
told
about
his
brother
william
the
judge
at
dubuque
and
a
farm
he
had
out
there
that
paid
for
itself
every
year
in
wheat
as
he
cast
off
all
fear
his
voice
rose
and
he
hammered
his
with
the
thick
of
his
hand
for
emphasis
corey
seemed
impressed
he
sat
perfectly
quiet
listening
and
lapham
saw
the
other
gentlemen
stop
in
their
talk
every
now
and
then
to
listen
after
this
proof
of
his
ability
to
interest
them
he
would
have
liked
to
have
lapham
suggest
again
that
he
was
unequal
to
their
society
or
to
the
society
of
anybody
else
he
surprised
himself
by
his
ease
among
men
whose
names
had
hitherto
overawed
him
he
got
to
calling
bromfield
corey
by
his
surname
alone
he
did
not
understand
why
young
corey
seemed
so
preoccupied
and
he
took
occasion
to
tell
the
company
how
he
had
said
to
his
wife
the
first
time
he
saw
that
fellow
that
he
could
make
a
man
of
him
if
he
had
him
in
the
business
and
he
guessed
he
was
not
mistaken
he
began
to
tell
stories
of
the
different
young
men
he
had
had
in
his
employ
at
last
he
had
the
talk
altogether
to
himself
no
one
else
talked
and
he
talked
unceasingly
it
was
a
great
time
it
was
a
triumph
he
was
in
this
successful
mood
when
word
came
to
him
that
lapham
was
going
tom
corey
seemed
to
have
brought
it
but
he
was
not
sure
anyway
he
was
not
going
to
hurry
he
made
cordial
invitations
to
each
of
the
gentlemen
to
drop
in
and
see
him
at
his
office
and
would
not
be
satisfied
till
he
had
exacted
a
promise
from
each
he
told
charles
bellingham
that
he
liked
him
and
assured
james
bellingham
that
it
had
always
been
his
ambition
to
know
him
and
that
if
any
one
had
said
when
he
first
came
to
boston
that
in
less
than
ten
years
he
should
be
hobnobbing
with
jim
bellingham
he
should
have
told
that
person
he
lied
he
would
have
told
anybody
he
lied
that
had
told
him
ten
years
ago
that
a
son
of
bromfield
corey
would
have
come
and
asked
him
to
take
him
into
the
business
ten
years
ago
he
silas
lapham
had
come
to
boston
a
little
worse
off
than
nothing
at
all
for
he
was
in
debt
for
half
the
money
that
he
had
bought
out
his
partner
with
and
here
he
was
now
worth
a
million
and
meeting
you
gentlemen
like
one
of
you
and
every
cent
of
that
was
honest
money
no
speculation
every
copper
of
it
for
value
received
and
here
only
the
other
day
his
old
partner
who
had
been
going
to
the
dogs
ever
since
he
went
out
of
the
business
came
and
borrowed
twenty
thousand
dollars
of
him
lapham
lent
it
because
his
wife
wanted
him
to
she
had
always
felt
bad
about
the
fellow
having
to
go
out
of
the
business
he
took
leave
of
sewell
with
patronising
affection
and
bade
him
come
to
him
if
he
ever
got
into
a
tight
place
with
his
parish
work
he
would
let
him
have
all
the
money
he
wanted
he
had
more
money
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
why
when
your
wife
sent
to
mine
last
fall
he
said
turning
to
corey
i
drew
my
cheque
for
five
hundred
dollars
but
my
wife
would
take
more
than
one
hundred
said
she
was
going
to
show
off
before
corey
i
call
that
a
pretty
good
joke
on
corey
i
must
tell
her
how
lapham
done
her
out
of
a
cool
four
hundred
dollars
he
started
toward
the
door
of
the
to
take
leave
of
the
ladies
but
tom
corey
was
at
his
elbow
saying
i
think
lapham
is
waiting
for
you
below
sir
and
in
obeying
the
direction
corey
gave
him
toward
another
door
he
forgot
all
about
his
purpose
and
came
away
without
saying
to
his
hostess
lapham
had
not
known
how
soon
she
ought
to
go
and
had
no
idea
that
in
her
quality
of
chief
guest
she
was
keeping
the
others
she
stayed
till
eleven
and
was
a
little
frightened
when
she
found
what
time
it
was
but
corey
without
pressing
her
to
stay
longer
had
said
it
was
not
at
all
late
she
and
irene
had
had
a
perfect
time
everybody
had
been
very
polite
on
the
way
home
they
celebrated
the
amiability
of
both
the
miss
coreys
and
of
miss
kingsbury
lapham
thought
that
bellingham
was
about
the
pleasantest
person
she
ever
saw
she
had
told
her
all
about
her
married
daughter
who
had
married
an
inventor
and
gone
to
live
in
omaha
a
blake
if
it
that
blake
said
lapham
proudly
i
know
all
about
him
i
sold
him
tons
of
the
paint
pooh
papa
how
you
do
smell
of
smoking
cried
irene
pretty
strong
eh
laughed
lapham
letting
down
a
window
of
the
carriage
his
heart
was
throbbing
wildly
in
the
close
air
and
he
was
glad
of
the
rush
of
cold
that
came
in
though
it
stopped
his
tongue
and
he
listened
more
and
more
drowsily
to
the
rejoicings
that
his
wife
and
daughter
exchanged
he
meant
to
have
them
wake
penelope
up
and
tell
her
what
she
had
lost
but
when
he
reached
home
he
was
too
sleepy
to
suggest
it
he
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
full
of
supreme
triumph
but
in
the
morning
his
skull
was
sore
with
the
unconscious
ache
and
he
rose
cross
and
taciturn
they
had
a
silent
breakfast
in
the
cold
grey
light
of
the
morning
the
glories
of
the
night
before
showed
poorer
here
and
there
a
painful
doubt
obtruded
itself
and
marred
them
with
its
awkward
shadow
penelope
sent
down
word
that
she
was
not
well
and
was
not
coming
to
breakfast
and
lapham
was
glad
to
go
to
his
office
without
seeing
her
he
was
severe
and
silent
all
day
with
his
clerks
and
peremptory
with
customers
of
corey
he
was
slyly
observant
and
as
the
day
wore
away
he
grew
more
restively
conscious
he
sent
out
word
by
his
that
he
would
like
to
see
corey
for
a
few
minutes
after
closing
the
girl
had
lingered
too
as
if
she
wished
to
speak
with
him
and
corey
stood
in
abeyance
as
she
went
toward
lapham
door
ca
see
you
zerrilla
he
said
bluffly
but
not
unkindly
perhaps
i
call
at
the
house
if
it
important
it
is
said
the
girl
with
a
spoiled
air
of
insistence
well
said
lapham
and
nodding
to
corey
to
enter
he
closed
the
door
upon
her
then
he
turned
to
the
young
man
and
demanded
was
i
drunk
last
night
xv
lapham
strenuous
face
was
broken
up
with
the
emotions
that
had
forced
him
to
this
question
shame
fear
of
the
things
that
must
have
been
thought
of
him
mixed
with
a
faint
hope
that
he
might
be
mistaken
which
died
out
at
the
shocked
and
pitying
look
in
corey
eyes
was
i
drunk
he
repeated
i
ask
you
because
i
was
never
touched
by
drink
in
my
life
before
and
i
do
know
he
stood
with
his
huge
hands
trembling
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
his
dry
lips
apart
as
he
stared
at
corey
that
is
what
every
one
understood
colonel
lapham
said
the
young
man
every
one
saw
how
it
was
do
did
they
talk
it
over
after
i
left
asked
lapham
vulgarly
excuse
me
said
corey
blushing
my
father
does
talk
his
guests
over
with
one
another
he
added
with
youthful
superfluity
you
were
among
gentlemen
i
was
the
only
one
that
was
a
gentleman
there
lamented
lapham
i
disgraced
you
i
disgraced
my
family
i
mortified
your
father
before
his
friends
his
head
dropped
i
showed
that
i
was
fit
to
go
with
you
i
not
fit
for
any
decent
place
what
did
i
say
what
did
i
do
he
asked
suddenly
lifting
his
head
and
confronting
corey
out
with
it
if
you
could
bear
to
see
it
and
hear
it
i
had
ought
to
bear
to
know
it
there
was
nothing
really
nothing
said
corey
beyond
the
fact
that
you
were
not
quite
yourself
there
was
nothing
whatever
my
father
did
speak
of
it
to
me
he
confessed
when
we
were
alone
he
said
that
he
was
afraid
we
had
not
been
thoughtful
of
you
if
you
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
only
water
i
told
him
i
had
not
seen
wine
at
your
table
the
others
said
nothing
about
you
ah
but
what
did
they
think
probably
what
we
did
that
it
was
purely
a
misfortune
an
accident
i
was
fit
to
be
there
persisted
lapham
do
you
want
to
leave
he
asked
with
savage
abruptness
leave
faltered
the
young
man
yes
quit
the
business
cut
the
whole
connection
i
have
the
remotest
idea
of
it
cried
corey
in
amazement
why
in
the
world
should
i
because
you
a
gentleman
and
i
not
and
it
ai
right
i
should
be
over
you
if
you
want
to
go
i
know
some
parties
that
would
be
glad
to
get
you
i
will
give
you
up
if
you
want
to
go
before
anything
worse
happens
and
i
sha
blame
you
i
can
help
you
to
something
better
than
i
can
offer
you
here
and
i
will
there
no
question
of
my
going
unless
you
wish
it
said
corey
if
you
do
will
you
tell
your
father
interrupted
lapham
that
i
had
a
notion
all
the
time
that
i
was
acting
the
drunken
blackguard
and
that
suffered
for
it
all
day
will
you
tell
him
i
do
want
him
to
notice
me
if
we
ever
meet
and
that
i
know
i
not
fit
to
associate
with
gentlemen
in
anything
but
a
business
way
if
i
am
that
certainly
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
retorted
corey
i
listen
to
you
any
longer
what
you
say
is
shocking
to
me
shocking
in
a
way
you
ca
think
why
man
exclaimed
lapham
with
astonishment
if
i
can
stand
it
you
can
no
said
corey
with
a
sick
look
that
does
follow
you
may
denounce
yourself
if
you
will
but
i
have
my
reasons
for
refusing
to
hear
you
my
reasons
why
i
ca
hear
you
if
you
say
another
word
i
must
go
away
i
do
understand
you
faltered
lapham
in
bewilderment
which
absorbed
even
his
shame
you
exaggerate
the
effect
of
what
has
happened
said
the
young
man
it
enough
more
than
enough
for
you
to
have
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
and
i
think
it
unbecoming
in
me
to
hear
you
he
made
a
movement
toward
the
door
but
lapham
stopped
him
with
the
tragic
humility
of
his
appeal
do
go
yet
i
ca
let
you
disgusted
you
i
see
that
but
i
did
mean
to
i
i
take
it
back
oh
there
nothing
to
take
back
said
corey
with
a
repressed
shudder
for
the
abasement
which
he
had
seen
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
think
no
more
there
was
one
of
the
gentlemen
present
last
night
who
did
understand
the
matter
precisely
as
my
father
and
i
did
and
that
fact
must
end
it
between
us
two
he
went
out
into
the
larger
office
beyond
leaving
lapham
helpless
to
prevent
his
going
it
had
become
a
vital
necessity
with
him
to
think
the
best
of
lapham
but
his
mind
was
in
a
whirl
of
whatever
thoughts
were
most
injurious
he
thought
of
him
the
night
before
in
the
company
of
those
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
he
quivered
in
resentment
of
his
vulgar
braggart
uncouth
nature
he
recognised
his
own
allegiance
to
the
exclusiveness
to
which
he
was
born
and
bred
as
a
man
perceives
his
duty
to
his
country
when
her
rights
are
invaded
his
eye
fell
on
the
porter
going
about
in
his
to
make
the
place
fast
for
the
night
and
he
said
to
himself
that
dennis
was
not
more
plebeian
than
his
master
that
the
gross
appetites
the
blunt
sense
the
purblind
ambition
the
stupid
arrogance
were
the
same
in
both
and
the
difference
was
in
a
brute
will
that
probably
left
the
porter
the
gentler
man
of
the
two
the
very
innocence
of
lapham
life
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
erred
wrought
against
him
in
the
young
mood
it
contained
the
insult
of
clownish
inexperience
amidst
the
stings
and
flashes
of
his
wounded
pride
all
the
social
traditions
all
the
habits
of
feeling
which
he
had
silenced
more
and
more
by
force
of
will
during
the
past
months
asserted
their
natural
sway
and
he
rioted
in
his
contempt
of
the
offensive
boor
who
was
even
more
offensive
in
his
shame
than
in
his
trespass
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
a
corey
as
if
that
were
somewhat
yet
he
knew
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
all
the
time
was
that
which
must
control
him
at
last
and
which
seemed
sweetly
to
be
suffering
his
rebellion
secure
of
his
submission
in
the
end
it
was
almost
with
the
girl
voice
that
it
seemed
to
plead
with
him
to
undo
in
him
effect
by
effect
the
work
of
his
indignant
resentment
to
set
all
things
in
another
and
fairer
light
to
give
him
hopes
to
suggest
palliations
to
protest
against
injustices
it
was
in
lapham
favour
that
he
was
so
guiltless
in
the
past
and
now
corey
asked
himself
if
it
were
the
first
time
he
could
have
wished
a
guest
at
his
father
table
to
have
taken
less
wine
whether
lapham
was
not
rather
to
be
honoured
for
not
knowing
how
to
contain
his
folly
where
a
veteran
transgressor
might
have
held
his
tongue
he
asked
himself
with
a
thrill
of
sudden
remorse
whether
when
lapham
humbled
himself
in
the
dust
so
shockingly
he
had
shown
him
the
sympathy
to
which
such
abandon
had
the
right
and
he
had
to
own
that
he
had
met
him
on
the
gentlemanly
ground
sparing
himself
and
asserting
the
superiority
of
his
sort
and
not
recognising
that
lapham
humiliation
came
from
the
sense
of
wrong
which
he
had
helped
to
accumulate
upon
him
by
superfinely
standing
aloof
and
refusing
to
touch
him
he
shut
his
desk
and
hurried
out
into
the
early
night
not
to
go
anywhere
but
to
walk
up
and
down
to
try
to
find
his
way
out
of
the
chaos
which
now
seemed
ruin
and
now
the
materials
out
of
which
fine
actions
and
a
happy
life
might
be
shaped
three
hours
later
he
stood
at
lapham
door
at
times
what
he
now
wished
to
do
had
seemed
for
ever
impossible
and
again
it
had
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
wait
a
moment
longer
he
had
not
been
careless
but
very
mindful
of
what
he
knew
must
be
the
feelings
of
his
own
family
in
regard
to
the
laphams
and
he
had
not
concealed
from
himself
that
his
family
had
great
reason
and
justice
on
their
side
in
not
wishing
him
to
alienate
himself
from
their
common
life
and
associations
the
most
that
he
could
urge
to
himself
was
that
they
had
not
all
the
reason
and
justice
but
he
had
hesitated
and
delayed
because
they
had
so
much
often
he
could
not
make
it
appear
right
that
he
should
merely
please
himself
in
what
chiefly
concerned
himself
he
perceived
how
far
apart
in
all
their
experiences
and
ideals
the
lapham
girls
and
his
sisters
were
how
different
lapham
was
from
his
mother
how
grotesquely
unlike
were
his
father
and
lapham
and
the
disparity
had
not
always
amused
him
he
had
often
taken
it
very
seriously
and
sometimes
he
said
that
he
must
forego
the
hope
on
which
his
heart
was
set
there
had
been
many
times
in
the
past
months
when
he
had
said
that
he
must
go
no
further
and
as
often
as
he
had
taken
this
stand
he
had
yielded
it
upon
this
or
that
excuse
which
he
was
aware
of
trumping
up
it
was
part
of
the
complication
that
he
should
be
unconscious
of
the
injury
he
might
be
doing
to
some
one
besides
his
family
and
himself
this
was
the
defect
of
his
diffidence
and
it
had
come
to
him
in
a
pang
for
the
first
time
when
his
mother
said
that
she
would
not
have
the
laphams
think
she
wished
to
make
more
of
the
acquaintance
than
he
did
and
then
it
had
come
too
late
since
that
he
had
suffered
quite
as
much
from
the
fear
that
it
might
not
be
as
that
it
might
be
so
and
now
in
the
mood
romantic
and
exalted
in
which
he
found
himself
concerning
lapham
he
was
as
far
as
might
be
from
vain
confidence
he
ended
the
question
in
his
own
mind
by
affirming
to
himself
that
he
was
there
first
of
all
to
see
lapham
and
give
him
an
ultimate
proof
of
his
own
perfect
faith
and
unabated
respect
and
to
offer
him
what
reparation
this
involved
for
that
want
of
sympathy
of
humanity
which
he
had
shown
xvi
the
nova
scotia
who
answered
corey
ring
said
that
lapham
had
not
come
home
yet
oh
said
the
young
man
hesitating
on
the
outer
step
i
guess
you
better
come
in
said
the
girl
i
go
and
see
when
they
expecting
him
corey
was
in
the
mood
to
be
swayed
by
any
chance
he
obeyed
the
suggestion
of
the
patronising
friendliness
and
let
her
shut
him
into
the
while
she
went
upstairs
to
announce
him
to
penelope
did
you
tell
him
father
was
at
home
yes
he
seemed
so
kind
of
disappointed
i
told
him
to
come
in
and
see
when
he
would
be
in
said
the
girl
with
the
human
interest
which
sometimes
replaces
in
the
american
domestic
the
servile
deference
of
other
countries
a
gleam
of
amusement
passed
over
penelope
face
as
she
glanced
at
herself
in
the
glass
well
she
cried
finally
dropping
from
her
shoulders
the
light
shawl
in
which
she
had
been
huddled
over
a
book
when
corey
rang
i
will
go
down
all
right
said
the
girl
and
penelope
began
hastily
to
amend
the
disarray
of
her
hair
which
she
tumbled
into
a
mass
on
the
top
of
her
little
head
setting
off
the
pale
dark
of
her
complexion
with
a
flash
of
crimson
ribbon
at
her
throat
she
moved
across
the
carpet
once
or
twice
with
the
quaint
grace
that
belonged
to
her
small
figure
made
a
dissatisfied
grimace
at
it
in
the
glass
caught
a
handkerchief
out
of
a
drawer
and
slid
it
into
her
pocket
and
then
descended
to
corey
the
lapham
in
nankeen
square
was
in
the
paint
which
the
colonel
had
hoped
to
repeat
in
his
new
house
the
trim
of
the
doors
and
windows
was
in
light
green
and
the
panels
in
salmon
the
walls
were
a
plain
tint
of
french
grey
paper
divided
by
gilt
mouldings
into
broad
panels
with
a
wide
stripe
of
red
velvet
paper
running
up
the
corners
the
chandelier
was
of
massive
imitation
bronze
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
rested
on
a
fringed
of
green
reps
and
heavy
curtains
of
that
stuff
hung
from
gilt
lambrequin
frames
at
the
window
the
carpet
was
of
a
small
pattern
in
crude
green
which
at
the
time
lapham
bought
it
covered
half
the
new
floors
in
boston
in
the
panelled
spaces
on
the
walls
were
some
landscapes
representing
the
mountains
and
canyons
of
the
west
which
the
colonel
and
his
wife
had
visited
on
one
of
the
early
official
railroad
excursions
in
front
of
the
long
windows
looking
into
the
square
were
statues
kneeling
figures
which
turned
their
backs
upon
the
company
and
represented
allegories
of
faith
and
prayer
to
people
without
a
white
marble
group
of
several
figures
expressing
an
italian
conception
of
lincoln
freeing
the
slaves
a
latin
negro
and
his
wife
with
our
eagle
flapping
his
wings
in
approval
at
feet
occupied
one
corner
and
balanced
the
of
an
earlier
period
in
another
these
phantasms
added
their
chill
to
that
imparted
by
the
tone
of
the
walls
the
landscapes
and
the
carpets
and
contributed
to
the
violence
of
the
contrast
when
the
chandelier
was
lighted
up
full
glare
and
the
heat
of
the
whole
furnace
welled
up
from
the
registers
into
the
quivering
atmosphere
on
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
the
laphams
invited
company
corey
had
not
been
in
this
room
before
the
family
had
always
received
him
in
what
they
called
the
penelope
looked
into
this
first
and
then
she
looked
into
the
parlour
with
a
smile
that
broke
into
a
laugh
as
she
discovered
him
standing
under
the
single
burner
which
the
had
lighted
for
him
in
the
chandelier
i
do
understand
how
you
came
to
be
put
in
there
she
said
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
cozier
place
unless
it
was
because
alice
thought
you
were
only
here
on
probation
anyway
father
has
got
home
yet
but
i
expecting
him
every
moment
i
do
know
what
keeping
him
did
the
girl
tell
you
that
mother
and
irene
were
out
no
she
did
say
it
very
good
of
you
to
see
me
she
had
not
seen
the
exaltation
which
he
had
been
feeling
he
perceived
with
half
a
sigh
it
must
all
be
upon
this
lower
level
perhaps
it
was
best
so
there
was
something
i
wished
to
say
to
your
father
i
hope
he
broke
off
you
better
oh
yes
thank
you
said
penelope
remembering
that
she
had
not
been
well
enough
to
go
to
dinner
the
night
before
we
all
missed
you
very
much
oh
thank
you
i
afraid
you
would
have
missed
me
if
i
had
been
there
oh
yes
we
should
said
corey
i
assure
you
they
looked
at
each
other
i
really
think
i
believed
i
was
saying
something
said
the
girl
and
so
did
i
replied
the
young
man
they
laughed
rather
wildly
and
then
they
both
became
rather
grave
he
took
the
chair
she
gave
him
and
looked
across
at
her
where
she
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
in
a
chair
lower
than
his
with
her
hands
dropped
in
her
lap
and
the
back
of
her
head
on
her
shoulders
as
she
looked
up
at
him
the
fire
in
the
grate
purred
and
flickered
the
cast
a
mellow
radiance
on
her
face
she
let
her
eyes
fall
and
then
lifted
them
for
an
irrelevant
glance
at
the
clock
on
the
mantel
mother
and
irene
have
gone
to
the
spanish
students
concert
oh
have
they
asked
corey
and
he
put
his
hat
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
she
looked
down
at
it
for
no
reason
and
then
looked
up
at
his
face
for
no
other
and
turned
a
little
red
corey
turned
a
little
red
himself
she
who
had
always
been
so
easy
with
him
now
became
a
little
constrained
do
you
know
how
warm
it
is
he
asked
no
is
it
warm
i
have
been
out
all
day
it
like
a
summer
night
she
turned
her
face
towards
the
fire
and
then
started
abruptly
perhaps
it
too
warm
for
you
here
oh
no
it
very
comfortable
i
suppose
it
the
cold
of
the
last
few
days
that
still
in
the
house
i
was
reading
with
a
shawl
on
when
you
came
i
interrupted
you
oh
no
i
had
finished
the
book
i
was
just
looking
over
it
again
do
you
like
to
read
books
over
yes
books
that
i
like
at
all
that
was
it
asked
corey
the
girl
hesitated
it
has
rather
a
sentimental
name
did
you
ever
read
it
tears
idle
tears
oh
yes
they
were
talking
of
that
last
night
it
a
famous
book
with
ladies
they
break
their
hearts
over
it
did
it
make
you
cry
oh
it
pretty
easy
to
cry
over
a
book
said
penelope
laughing
and
that
one
is
very
natural
till
you
come
to
the
main
point
then
the
naturalness
of
all
the
rest
makes
that
seem
natural
too
but
i
guess
it
rather
forced
her
giving
him
up
to
the
other
one
yes
simply
because
she
happened
to
know
that
the
other
one
had
cared
for
him
first
why
should
she
have
done
it
what
right
had
she
i
do
know
i
suppose
that
the
but
it
was
or
not
alone
she
was
sacrificing
him
too
and
for
some
one
who
could
appreciate
him
half
as
much
as
she
could
i
provoked
with
myself
when
i
think
how
i
cried
over
that
book
for
i
did
cry
it
silly
it
wicked
for
any
one
to
do
what
that
girl
did
why
ca
they
let
people
have
a
chance
to
behave
reasonably
in
stories
perhaps
they
could
make
it
so
attractive
suggested
corey
with
a
smile
it
would
be
novel
at
any
rate
said
the
girl
but
so
it
would
in
real
life
i
suppose
she
added
i
do
know
why
should
people
in
love
behave
sensibly
that
a
very
serious
question
said
penelope
gravely
i
answer
it
and
she
left
him
the
embarrassment
of
supporting
an
inquiry
which
she
had
certainly
instigated
herself
she
seemed
to
have
finally
recovered
her
own
ease
in
doing
this
do
you
admire
our
autumnal
display
mr
corey
your
display
the
trees
in
the
square
we
think
it
quite
equal
to
an
opening
at
jordan
marsh
ah
i
afraid
you
would
let
me
be
serious
even
about
your
maples
oh
yes
i
should
if
you
like
to
be
serious
do
you
well
not
about
serious
matters
that
the
reason
that
book
made
me
cry
you
make
fun
of
everything
miss
irene
was
telling
me
last
night
about
you
then
it
no
use
for
me
to
deny
it
so
soon
i
must
give
irene
a
talking
to
i
hope
you
wo
forbid
her
to
talk
about
you
she
had
taken
up
a
fan
from
the
table
and
held
it
now
between
her
face
and
the
fire
and
now
between
her
face
and
him
her
little
visage
with
that
arch
lazy
look
in
it
topped
by
its
mass
of
dusky
hair
and
dwindling
from
the
full
cheeks
to
the
small
chin
had
a
japanese
effect
in
the
subdued
light
and
it
had
the
charm
which
comes
to
any
woman
with
happiness
it
would
be
hard
to
say
how
much
of
this
she
perceived
that
he
felt
they
talked
about
other
things
a
while
and
then
she
came
back
to
what
he
had
said
she
glanced
at
him
obliquely
round
her
fan
and
stopped
moving
it
does
irene
talk
about
me
she
asked
i
think
so
yes
perhaps
it
only
i
who
talk
about
you
you
must
blame
me
if
it
wrong
he
returned
oh
i
did
say
it
was
wrong
she
replied
but
i
hope
if
you
said
anything
very
bad
of
me
you
let
me
know
what
it
was
so
that
i
can
reform
no
do
change
please
cried
the
young
man
penelope
caught
her
breath
but
went
on
resolutely
or
rebuke
you
for
speaking
evil
of
dignities
she
looked
down
at
the
fan
now
flat
in
her
lap
and
tried
to
govern
her
head
but
it
trembled
and
she
remained
looking
down
again
they
let
the
talk
stray
and
then
it
was
he
who
brought
it
back
to
themselves
as
if
it
had
not
left
them
i
have
to
talk
of
you
said
corey
because
i
get
to
talk
to
you
so
seldom
you
mean
that
i
do
all
the
talking
when
we
together
she
glanced
sidewise
at
him
but
she
reddened
after
speaking
the
last
word
we
so
seldom
together
he
pursued
i
do
know
what
you
mean
sometimes
i
thought
i
been
afraid
that
you
avoided
me
avoided
you
yes
tried
not
to
be
alone
with
me
she
might
have
told
him
that
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
be
alone
with
him
and
that
it
was
very
strange
he
should
make
this
complaint
of
her
but
she
did
not
she
kept
looking
down
at
the
fan
and
then
she
lifted
her
burning
face
and
looked
at
the
clock
again
mother
and
irene
will
be
sorry
to
miss
you
she
gasped
he
instantly
rose
and
came
towards
her
she
rose
too
and
mechanically
put
out
her
hand
he
took
it
as
if
to
say
i
did
mean
to
send
you
away
she
besought
him
oh
i
not
going
he
answered
simply
i
wanted
to
say
to
say
that
it
i
who
make
her
talk
about
you
to
say
i
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
i
said
it
so
often
to
myself
that
i
feel
as
if
you
must
know
it
she
stood
quite
still
letting
him
keep
her
hand
and
questioning
his
face
with
a
bewildered
gaze
you
must
know
she
must
have
told
you
she
must
have
guessed
penelope
turned
white
but
outwardly
quelled
the
panic
that
sent
the
blood
to
her
heart
i
i
did
expect
i
hoped
to
have
seen
your
father
but
i
must
speak
now
whatever
i
love
you
she
freed
her
hand
from
both
of
those
he
had
closed
upon
it
and
went
back
from
him
across
the
room
with
a
sinuous
spring
me
whatever
potential
complicity
had
lurked
in
her
heart
his
words
brought
her
only
immeasurable
dismay
he
came
towards
her
again
yes
you
who
else
she
fended
him
off
with
an
imploring
gesture
i
thought
i
it
was
she
shut
her
lips
tight
and
stood
looking
at
him
where
he
remained
in
silent
amaze
then
her
words
came
again
shudderingly
oh
what
have
you
done
upon
my
soul
he
said
with
a
vague
smile
i
do
know
i
hope
no
harm
oh
do
laugh
she
cried
laughing
hysterically
herself
unless
you
want
me
to
think
you
the
greatest
wretch
in
the
world
i
he
responded
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
you
mean
you
know
i
ca
tell
you
can
you
say
can
you
put
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
say
that
you
say
you
never
meant
that
you
meant
me
all
along
yes
yes
who
else
i
came
here
to
see
your
father
and
to
tell
him
that
i
wished
to
tell
you
this
to
ask
him
but
what
does
it
matter
you
must
have
known
it
you
must
have
seen
and
it
for
you
to
answer
me
i
been
abrupt
i
know
and
i
startled
you
but
if
you
love
me
you
can
forgive
that
to
my
loving
you
so
long
before
i
spoke
she
gazed
at
him
with
parted
lips
oh
mercy
what
shall
i
do
if
it
true
what
you
say
you
must
go
she
said
and
you
must
never
come
any
more
do
you
promise
that
certainly
not
said
the
young
man
why
should
i
promise
such
a
thing
so
abominably
wrong
i
could
obey
if
you
did
love
me
oh
i
do
indeed
i
do
now
will
you
obey
no
i
do
believe
you
oh
he
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
again
my
love
my
dearest
what
is
this
trouble
that
you
ca
tell
it
it
ca
be
anything
about
yourself
if
it
is
anything
about
any
one
else
it
would
make
the
least
difference
in
the
world
no
matter
what
it
was
i
would
be
only
too
glad
to
show
by
any
act
or
deed
i
could
that
nothing
could
change
me
towards
you
oh
you
do
understand
no
i
do
you
must
tell
me
i
will
never
do
that
then
i
will
stay
here
till
your
mother
comes
and
ask
her
what
it
is
ask
her
yes
do
you
think
i
will
give
you
up
till
i
know
why
i
must
you
force
me
to
it
will
you
go
if
i
tell
you
and
never
let
any
human
creature
know
what
you
have
said
to
me
not
unless
you
give
me
leave
that
will
be
never
well
then
she
stopped
and
made
two
or
three
ineffectual
efforts
to
begin
again
no
no
i
ca
you
must
go
i
will
not
go
you
said
you
loved
me
if
you
do
you
will
go
he
dropped
the
hands
he
had
stretched
towards
her
and
she
hid
her
face
in
her
own
there
she
said
turning
it
suddenly
upon
him
sit
down
there
and
will
you
promise
me
on
your
honour
not
to
speak
not
to
try
to
persuade
me
not
to
touch
me
you
wo
touch
me
i
will
obey
you
penelope
as
if
you
were
never
to
see
me
again
as
if
i
were
dying
i
will
do
what
you
say
but
i
shall
see
you
again
and
do
talk
of
dying
this
is
the
beginning
of
life
no
it
the
end
said
the
girl
resuming
at
last
something
of
the
hoarse
drawl
which
the
tumult
of
her
feeling
had
broken
into
those
appeals
she
sat
down
too
and
lifted
her
face
towards
him
it
the
end
of
life
for
me
because
i
know
now
that
i
must
have
been
playing
false
from
the
beginning
you
do
know
what
i
mean
and
i
can
never
tell
you
it
is
my
secret
it
some
one
else
you
you
must
never
come
here
again
i
ca
tell
you
why
and
you
must
never
try
to
know
do
you
promise
you
can
forbid
me
i
must
do
what
you
say
i
do
forbid
you
then
and
you
shall
not
think
i
am
cruel
how
could
i
think
that
oh
how
hard
you
make
it
corey
laughed
for
very
despair
can
i
make
it
easier
by
disobeying
you
i
know
i
am
talking
crazily
but
i
not
crazy
no
no
he
said
with
some
wild
notion
of
comforting
her
but
try
to
tell
me
this
trouble
there
is
nothing
under
heaven
no
calamity
no
sorrow
that
i
would
gladly
share
with
you
or
take
all
upon
myself
if
i
could
i
know
but
this
you
ca
oh
my
dearest
wait
think
let
me
ask
your
mother
your
father
she
gave
a
cry
no
if
you
do
that
you
will
make
me
hate
you
will
you
the
rattling
of
a
was
heard
in
the
outer
door
promise
cried
penelope
oh
i
promise
she
suddenly
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
pressing
her
cheek
tight
against
his
flashed
out
of
the
room
by
one
door
as
her
father
entered
it
by
another
corey
turned
to
him
in
a
daze
i
i
called
to
speak
with
you
about
a
matter
but
it
so
late
now
i
i
see
you
no
time
like
the
present
said
lapham
with
a
fierceness
that
did
not
seem
referable
to
corey
he
had
his
hat
still
on
and
he
glared
at
the
young
man
out
of
his
blue
eyes
with
a
fire
that
something
else
must
have
kindled
there
i
really
ca
now
said
corey
weakly
it
will
do
quite
as
well
good
night
sir
good
night
answered
lapham
abruptly
following
him
to
the
door
and
shutting
it
after
him
i
think
the
devil
must
have
got
into
pretty
much
everybody
he
muttered
coming
back
to
the
room
where
he
put
down
his
hat
then
he
went
to
the
and
called
down
hello
alice
i
want
something
to
eat
xvii
what
the
reason
the
girls
never
get
down
to
breakfast
any
more
asked
lapham
when
he
met
his
wife
at
the
table
in
the
morning
he
had
been
up
an
hour
and
a
half
and
he
spoke
with
the
severity
of
a
hungry
man
it
seems
to
me
they
do
amount
to
anything
here
i
am
at
my
time
of
life
up
the
first
one
in
the
house
i
ring
the
bell
for
the
cook
at
six
every
morning
and
the
breakfast
is
on
the
table
at
seven
right
along
like
clockwork
but
i
never
see
anybody
but
you
till
i
go
to
the
office
oh
yes
you
do
si
said
his
wife
soothingly
the
girls
are
nearly
always
down
but
they
young
and
it
tires
them
more
than
it
does
us
to
get
up
early
they
can
rest
afterwards
they
do
do
anything
after
they
are
up
grumbled
lapham
well
that
your
fault
ai
it
you
ought
to
have
made
so
much
money
and
then
they
have
had
to
work
she
laughed
at
spartan
mood
and
went
on
to
excuse
the
young
people
irene
been
up
two
nights
hand
running
and
penelope
says
she
ai
well
what
makes
you
so
cross
about
the
girls
been
doing
something
you
ashamed
of
i
tell
you
when
i
been
doing
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
growled
lapham
oh
no
you
wo
said
his
wife
jollily
you
only
be
hard
on
the
rest
of
us
come
now
si
what
is
it
lapham
frowned
into
his
coffee
with
sulky
dignity
and
said
without
looking
up
i
wonder
what
that
fellow
wanted
here
last
night
what
fellow
corey
i
found
him
here
when
i
came
home
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
me
but
he
would
stop
where
was
he
in
the
was
pen
there
i
did
see
her
lapham
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
why
what
in
the
land
did
he
want
did
he
say
he
wanted
you
that
what
he
said
and
then
he
would
stay
well
then
i
tell
you
just
what
it
is
silas
lapham
he
came
here
she
looked
about
the
room
and
lowered
her
voice
to
see
you
about
irene
and
then
he
had
the
courage
i
guess
he
got
courage
enough
to
do
pretty
much
what
he
wants
to
said
lapham
glumly
all
i
know
is
he
was
here
you
better
ask
pen
about
it
if
she
ever
gets
down
i
guess
i
sha
wait
for
her
said
lapham
and
as
her
husband
closed
the
front
door
after
him
she
opened
that
of
her
daughter
room
and
entered
abruptly
the
girl
sat
at
the
window
fully
dressed
and
as
if
she
had
been
sitting
there
a
long
time
without
rising
she
turned
her
face
towards
her
mother
it
merely
showed
black
against
the
light
and
revealed
nothing
till
her
mother
came
close
to
her
with
successive
questions
why
how
long
have
you
been
up
pen
why
do
you
come
to
your
breakfast
did
you
see
corey
when
he
called
last
night
why
the
matter
with
you
what
have
you
been
crying
about
have
i
been
crying
yes
your
cheeks
are
all
wet
i
thought
they
were
on
fire
well
i
tell
you
what
happened
she
rose
and
then
fell
back
in
her
chair
lock
the
door
she
ordered
and
her
mother
mechanically
obeyed
i
do
want
irene
in
here
there
nothing
the
matter
only
corey
offered
himself
to
me
last
night
her
mother
remained
looking
at
her
helpless
not
so
much
with
amaze
perhaps
as
dismay
oh
i
not
a
ghost
i
wish
i
was
you
had
better
sit
down
mother
you
have
got
to
know
all
about
it
lapham
dropped
nervelessly
into
the
chair
at
the
other
window
and
while
the
girl
went
slowly
but
briefly
on
touching
only
the
vital
points
of
the
story
and
breaking
at
times
into
a
bitter
drollery
she
sat
as
if
without
the
power
to
speak
or
stir
well
that
all
mother
i
should
say
i
had
dreamt
it
if
i
had
slept
any
last
night
but
i
guess
it
really
happened
the
mother
glanced
round
at
the
bed
and
said
glad
to
occupy
herself
delayingly
with
the
minor
care
why
you
have
been
sitting
up
all
night
you
will
kill
yourself
i
do
know
about
killing
myself
but
i
been
sitting
up
all
night
answered
the
girl
then
seeing
that
her
mother
remained
blankly
silent
again
she
demanded
why
do
you
blame
me
mother
why
do
you
say
that
i
led
him
on
and
tried
to
get
him
away
from
her
do
you
believe
i
did
her
mother
made
her
no
answer
as
if
these
ravings
of
needed
none
do
you
think
she
asked
simply
that
he
got
the
idea
you
cared
for
him
he
knew
it
how
could
i
keep
it
from
him
i
said
i
did
at
first
it
was
no
use
sighed
the
mother
you
might
as
well
said
you
did
it
could
help
irene
any
if
you
did
i
always
tried
to
help
her
with
him
even
when
i
yes
i
know
but
she
never
was
equal
to
him
i
saw
that
from
the
start
but
i
tried
to
blind
myself
to
it
and
when
he
kept
coming
you
never
thought
of
me
cried
the
girl
with
a
bitterness
that
reached
her
mother
heart
i
was
nobody
i
could
feel
no
one
could
care
for
me
the
turmoil
of
despair
of
triumph
of
remorse
and
resentment
which
filled
her
soul
tried
to
express
itself
in
the
words
no
said
the
mother
humbly
i
did
think
of
you
or
i
think
of
you
enough
it
did
come
across
me
sometimes
that
may
be
but
it
did
seem
as
if
and
your
going
on
so
for
irene
you
let
me
go
on
you
made
me
always
go
and
talk
with
him
for
her
and
you
did
think
i
would
talk
to
him
for
myself
well
i
did
i
punished
for
it
when
did
you
begin
to
care
for
him
how
do
i
know
what
difference
does
it
make
it
all
over
now
no
matter
when
it
began
he
wo
come
here
any
more
unless
i
let
him
she
could
not
help
betraying
her
pride
in
this
authority
of
hers
but
she
went
on
anxiously
enough
what
will
you
say
to
irene
she
safe
as
far
as
i
concerned
but
if
he
do
care
for
her
what
will
you
do
i
do
know
what
to
do
said
lapham
she
sat
in
an
apathy
from
which
she
apparently
could
not
rouse
herself
i
do
see
as
anything
can
be
done
penelope
laughed
in
a
pitying
derision
well
let
things
go
on
then
but
they
wo
go
on
no
they
wo
go
on
echoed
her
mother
she
pretty
enough
and
she
capable
and
your
father
got
the
money
i
do
know
what
saying
she
ai
equal
to
him
and
she
never
was
i
kept
feeling
it
all
the
time
and
yet
i
kept
blinding
myself
if
he
had
ever
cared
for
her
said
penelope
it
would
have
mattered
whether
she
was
equal
to
him
or
not
i
not
equal
to
him
either
her
mother
went
on
i
might
have
thought
it
was
you
but
i
had
got
set
well
i
can
see
it
all
clear
enough
now
it
too
late
i
know
what
to
do
and
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
demanded
the
girl
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
irene
and
tell
her
that
i
got
him
away
from
her
o
good

a
perfect
right
to
do
it
there
ai
any
one
to
blame
he
behaved
like
a
gentleman
and
i
can
see
now
that
he
never
thought
of

and
that
it
was

while

her
heart

on
him
mother
she
got
her
whole
life
set
on
him
you
know
that
yes
that
so
said
the
mother
as
promptly
as
if
she
had
been
arguing
to
that
rather
than
the
contrary
effect
if
i
could
give
him
to
her
i
would
but
he
is
mine
to
give
she
added
in
a
burst
of
despair
he
is
mine
to
keep
well
said
lapham
she
has
got
to
bear
it
i
do
know
to
come
of
it
all
but
she
got
to
bear
her
share
of
it
she
rose
and
went
toward
the
door
penelope
ran
after
her
in
a
sort
of
terror
you
not
going
to
tell
irene
she
gasped
seizing
her
mother
by
either
shoulder
yes
i
am
said
lapham
if
she
a
woman
grown
she
can
bear
a
woman
burden
i
ca
let
you
tell
irene
said
the
girl
letting
fall
her
face
on
her
mother
neck
not
irene
she
moaned
i
afraid
to
let
you
how
can
i
ever
look
at
her
again
why
you
have
done
anything
pen
said
her
mother
soothingly
i
wanted
to
yes
i
must
have
done
something
how
could
i
help
it
i
did
care
for
him
from
the
first
and
i
must
have
tried
to
make
him
like
me
do
you
think
i
did
no
no
you
must
tell
irene
not
not
yet
mother
yes
i
did
try
to
get
him
from
her
she
cried
lifting
her
head
and
suddenly
looking
her
mother
in
the
face
with
those
large
dim
eyes
of
hers
what
do
you
think
even
last
night
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
had
him
all
to
myself
for
myself
and
i
know
now
that
i
tried
to
make
him
think
that
i
was
pretty
and
funny
and
i
did
try
to
make
him
think
of
her
i
knew
that
i
pleased
him
and
i
tried
to
please
him
more
perhaps
i
could
have
kept
him
from
saying
that
he
cared
for
me
but
when
i
saw
he
did
i
must
have
seen
it
i
could
i
had
never
had
him
to
myself
and
for
myself
before
i
need
have
seen
him
at
all
but
i
wanted
to
see
him
and
when
i
was
sitting
there
alone
with
him
how
do
i
know
what
i
did
to
let
him
feel
that
i
cared
for
him
now
will
you
tell
irene
i
never
thought
he
did
care
for
me
and
never
expected
him
to
but
i
liked
him
yes
i
did
like
him
tell
her
that
or
else
i
will
if
it
was
to
tell
her
he
was
dead
began
lapham
absently
how
easy
it
would
be
cried
the
girl
in
but
worse
than
dead
to
her
and
so
am
i
turned
it
over
a
million
ways
mother
i
looked
at
it
in
every
light
you
can
put
it
in
and
i
ca
make
anything
but
misery
out
of
it
you
can
see
the
misery
at
the
first
glance
and
you
ca
see
more
or
less
if
you
spend
your
life
looking
at
it
she
laughed
again
as
if
the
hopelessness
of
the
thing
amused
her
then
she
flew
to
the
extreme
of
well
i
have
a
right
to
him
and
he
has
a
right
to
me
if
he
never
done
anything
to
make
her
think
he
cared
for
her
and
i
know
he
has
it
all
been
our
doing
then
he
free
and
i
free
we
ca
make
her
happy
whatever
we
do
and
why
should
i
no
that
wo
do
i
reached
that
point
before
she
broke
again
into
her
desperate
laugh
you
may
try
now
mother
i
best
speak
to
your
father
first
penelope
smiled
a
little
more
forlornly
than
she
had
laughed
well
yes
the
colonel
will
have
to
know
it
is
a
trouble
that
i
can
keep
to
myself
exactly
it
seems
to
belong
to
too
many
other
people
her
mother
took
a
crazy
encouragement
from
her
return
to
her
old
way
of
saying
things
perhaps
he
can
think
of
something
oh
i
do
doubt
but
the
colonel
will
know
just
what
to
do
you
must
be
too
about
it
it
it
all
come
right
you
tell
irene
that
mother
lapham
had
put
her
hand
on
the
she
dropped
it
and
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
beseeching
appeal
for
the
comfort
she
could
not
imagine
herself
do
look
at
me
mother
said
penelope
shaking
her
head
you
know
that
if
irene
were
to
die
without
knowing
it
it
would
come
right
for
me
pen
i
read
of
cases
where
a
girl
gives
up
the
man
that
loves
her
so
as
to
make
some
other
girl
happy
that
the
man
does
love
that
might
be
done
your
father
would
think
you
were
a
fool
said
lapham
finding
a
sort
of
refuge
in
her
strong
disgust
for
the
pseudo
heroism
no
if
there
to
be
any
giving
up
let
it
be
by
the
one
that
sha
make
anybody
but
herself
suffer
there
trouble
and
sorrow
enough
in
the
world
without
making
it
on
purpose
she
unlocked
the
door
but
penelope
slipped
round
and
set
herself
against
it
irene
shall
not
give
up
i
will
see
your
father
about
it
said
the
mother
let
me
out
now
do
let
irene
come
here
no
i
will
tell
her
that
you
have
slept
go
to
bed
now
and
try
to
get
some
rest
she
is
up
herself
yet
you
must
have
some
breakfast
no
let
me
sleep
if
i
can
i
can
get
something
when
i
wake
up
come
down
if
i
ca
sleep
life
has
got
to
go
on
it
does
when
there
a
death
in
the
house
and
this
is
only
a
little
worse
do
you
talk
nonsense
cried
lapham
with
angry
authority
well
a
little
better
then
said
penelope
with
meek
concession
lapham
attempted
to
say
something
and
could
not
she
went
out
and
opened
irene
door
the
girl
lifted
her
head
drowsily
from
her
pillow
do
disturb
your
sister
when
you
get
up
irene
she
slept
well
please
do
talk
i
almost
dead
with
sleep
returned
irene
do
go
mamma
i
sha
disturb
her
she
turned
her
face
down
in
the
pillow
and
pulled
the
covering
up
over
her
ears
the
mother
slowly
closed
the
door
and
went
downstairs
feeling
bewildered
and
baffled
almost
beyond
the
power
to
move
the
time
had
been
when
she
would
have
tried
to
find
out
why
this
judgment
had
been
sent
upon
her
but
now
she
could
not
feel
that
the
innocent
suffering
of
others
was
inflicted
for
her
fault
she
shrank
instinctively
from
that
cruel
and
egotistic
misinterpretation
of
the
mystery
of
pain
and
loss
she
saw
her
two
children
equally
if
differently
dear
to
her
destined
to
trouble
that
nothing
could
avert
and
she
could
not
blame
either
of
them
she
could
not
blame
the
means
of
this
misery
to
them
he
was
as
innocent
as
they
and
though
her
heart
was
sore
against
him
in
this
first
moment
she
could
still
be
just
to
him
in
it
she
was
a
woman
who
had
been
used
to
seek
the
light
by
striving
she
had
hitherto
literally
worked
to
it
but
it
is
the
curse
of
prosperity
that
it
takes
work
away
from
us
and
shuts
that
door
to
hope
and
health
of
spirit
in
this
house
where
everything
had
come
to
be
done
for
her
she
had
no
tasks
to
interpose
between
her
and
her
despair
she
sat
down
in
her
own
room
and
let
her
hands
fall
in
her
lap
the
hands
that
had
once
been
so
helpful
and
busy
and
tried
to
think
it
all
out
she
had
never
heard
of
the
fate
that
was
once
supposed
to
appoint
the
sorrows
of
men
irrespective
of
their
blamelessness
or
blame
before
the
time
when
it
came
to
be
believed
that
sorrows
were
penalties
but
in
her
simple
way
she
recognised
something
like
that
mythic
power
when
she
rose
from
her
struggle
with
the
problem
and
said
aloud
to
herself
well
the
witch
is
in
it
turn
which
way
she
would
she
saw
no
escape
from
the
misery
to
come
the
misery
which
had
come
already
to
penelope
and
herself
and
that
must
come
to
irene
and
her
father
she
started
when
she
definitely
thought
of
her
husband
and
thought
with
what
violence
it
would
work
in
every
fibre
of
his
rude
strength
she
feared
that
and
she
feared
something
worse
the
effect
which
his
pride
and
ambition
might
seek
to
give
it
and
it
was
with
terror
of
this
as
well
as
the
natural
trust
with
which
a
woman
must
turn
to
her
husband
in
any
anxiety
at
last
that
she
felt
she
could
not
wait
for
evening
to
take
counsel
with
him
when
she
considered
how
wrongly
he
might
take
it
all
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
already
known
to
him
and
she
was
impatient
to
prevent
his
error
she
sent
out
for
a
messenger
whom
she
despatched
with
a
note
to
his
place
of
business
silas
i
should
like
to
ride
with
you
this
afternoon
ca
you
come
home
early
persis
and
she
was
at
dinner
with
irene
evading
her
questions
about
penelope
when
answer
came
that
he
would
be
at
the
house
with
the
buggy
at
two
it
is
easy
to
put
off
a
girl
who
has
but
one
thing
in
her
head
but
though
lapham
could
escape
without
telling
anything
of
penelope
she
could
not
escape
seeing
how
wholly
irene
was
engrossed
with
hopes
now
turned
so
vain
and
impossible
she
was
still
talking
of
that
dinner
of
nothing
but
that
dinner
and
begging
for
flattery
of
herself
and
praise
of
him
which
her
mother
had
till
now
been
so
ready
to
give
seems
to
me
you
do
take
very
much
interest
mamma
she
said
laughing
and
blushing
at
one
point
yes
yes
i
do
protested
lapham
and
then
the
girl
prattled
on
i
guess
i
shall
get
one
of
those
pins
that
nanny
corey
had
in
her
hair
i
think
it
would
become
me
do
you
yes
but
irene
i
like
to
have
you
go
on
so
till
unless
he
said
something
to
show
you
ought
to
give
yourself
up
to
thinking
but
at
this
the
girl
turned
so
white
and
looked
such
reproach
at
her
that
she
added
frantically
yes
get
the
pin
it
is
just
the
thing
for
you
but
do
disturb
penelope
let
her
alone
till
i
get
back
i
going
out
to
ride
with
your
father
he
be
here
in
half
an
hour
are
you
through
ring
then
get
yourself
that
fan
you
saw
the
other
day
your
father
wo
say
anything
he
likes
to
have
you
look
well
i
could
see
his
eyes
on
you
half
the
time
the
other
night
i
should
have
liked
to
have
pen
go
with
me
said
irene
restored
to
her
normal
state
of
innocent
selfishness
by
these
flatteries
you
suppose
she
be
up
in
time
what
the
matter
with
her
that
she
did
sleep
i
do
know
better
let
her
alone
well
submitted
irene
xviii
lapham
went
away
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
she
was
waiting
at
the
window
when
her
husband
drove
up
she
opened
the
door
and
ran
down
the
steps
do
get
out
i
can
help
myself
in
and
she
clambered
to
his
side
while
he
kept
the
fidgeting
mare
still
with
voice
and
touch
where
do
you
want
i
should
go
he
asked
turning
the
buggy
oh
i
do
care
out
brookline
way
i
guess
i
wish
you
brought
this
fool
of
a
horse
she
gave
way
petulantly
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
when
i
ca
drive
this
mare
and
talk
too
i
sell
out
altogether
said
lapham
she
be
quiet
enough
when
she
had
her
spin
well
said
his
wife
and
while
they
were
making
their
way
across
the
city
to
the
milldam
she
answered
certain
questions
he
asked
about
some
points
in
the
new
house
i
should
have
liked
to
have
you
stop
there
he
began
but
she
answered
so
quickly
not
that
he
gave
it
up
and
turned
his
horse
head
westward
when
they
struck
beacon
street
he
let
the
mare
out
and
he
did
not
pull
her
in
till
he
left
the
brighton
road
and
struck
off
under
the
low
boughs
that
met
above
one
of
the
quiet
streets
of
brookline
where
the
stone
cottages
with
here
and
there
a
patch
of
determined
ivy
on
their
northern
walls
did
what
they
could
to
look
english
amid
the
glare
of
the
autumnal
foliage
the
smooth
earthen
track
under
the
mare
hoofs
was
scattered
with
flakes
of
the
red
and
yellow
gold
that
made
the
air
luminous
around
them
and
the
perspective
was
gay
with
innumerable
tints
and
tones
pretty
sightly
said
lapham
with
a
long
sigh
letting
the
reins
lie
loose
in
his
vigilant
hand
to
which
he
seemed
to
relegate
the
whole
charge
of
the
mare
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
rogers
persis
he
been
getting
in
deeper
and
deeper
with
me
and
last
night
he
pestered
me
half
to
death
to
go
in
with
him
in
one
of
his
schemes
i
ai
going
to
blame
anybody
but
i
hai
got
very
much
confidence
in
rogers
and
i
told
him
so
last
night
oh
do
talk
to
me
about
rogers
his
wife
broke
in
something
a
good
deal
more
important
than
rogers
in
the
world
and
more
important
than
your
business
it
seems
as
if
you
could
think
of
anything
else
that
and
the
new
house
did
you
suppose
i
wanted
to
ride
so
as
to
talk
rogers
with
you
she
demanded
yielding
to
the
necessity
a
wife
feels
of
making
her
husband
pay
for
her
suffering
even
if
he
has
not
inflicted
it
i
declare
well
hold
on
now
said
lapham
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
i
listening
his
wife
began
why
it
just
this
silas
lapham
and
then
she
broke
off
to
say
well
you
may
wait
now
starting
me
wrong
when
it
hard
enough
anyway
lapham
silently
turned
his
whip
over
and
over
in
his
hand
and
waited
did
you
suppose
she
asked
at
last
that
that
young
corey
had
been
coming
to
see
irene
i
do
know
what
i
supposed
replied
lapham
sullenly
you
always
said
so
he
looked
sharply
at
her
under
his
lowering
brows
well
he
has
said
lapham
and
she
replied
to
the
frown
that
blackened
on
her
husband
face
and
i
can
tell
you
what
if
you
take
it
in
that
way
i
sha
speak
another
word
who
takin
it
what
way
retorted
lapham
savagely
what
are
you
drivin
at
i
want
you
should
promise
that
you
hear
me
out
quietly
i
hear
you
out
if
you
give
me
a
chance
i
have
said
a
word
yet
well
i
not
going
to
have
you
flying
into
forty
furies
and
looking
like
a
perfect
at
the
very
start
i
had
to
bear
it
and
you
got
to
bear
it
too
well
let
me
have
a
chance
at
it
then
it
nothing
to
blame
anybody
about
as
i
can
see
and
the
only
question
is
what
the
best
thing
to
do
about
it
there
only
one
thing
we
can
do
for
if
he
do
care
for
the
child
nobody
wants
to
make
him
if
he
has
been
coming
to
see
her
he
has
and
all
there
is
to
it
no
it
ai
exclaimed
lapham
there
protested
his
wife
if
he
has
been
coming
to
see
her
what
has
he
been
coming
for
he
been
coming
to
see
pen
cried
the
wife
now
are
you
satisfied
her
tone
implied
that
he
had
brought
it
all
upon
them
but
at
the
sight
of
the
swift
passions
working
in
his
face
to
a
perfect
comprehension
of
the
whole
trouble
she
fell
to
trembling
and
her
broken
voice
lost
all
the
spurious
indignation
she
had
put
into
it
o
silas
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
i
afraid
it
kill
irene
lapham
pulled
off
the
loose
from
his
right
hand
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
in
which
the
reins
lay
he
passed
it
over
his
forehead
and
then
flicked
from
it
the
moisture
it
had
gathered
there
he
caught
his
breath
once
or
twice
like
a
man
who
meditates
a
struggle
with
superior
force
and
then
remains
passive
in
its
grasp
his
wife
felt
the
need
of
comforting
him
as
she
had
felt
the
need
of
afflicting
him
i
do
say
but
what
it
can
be
made
to
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
all
i
say
is
i
do
see
my
way
clear
yet
what
makes
you
think
he
likes
pen
he
asked
quietly
he
told
her
so
last
night
and
she
told
me
this
morning
was
he
at
the
office
yes
he
was
there
i
have
been
there
much
myself
he
did
say
anything
to
me
does
irene
know
no
i
left
her
getting
ready
to
go
out
shopping
she
wants
to
get
a
pin
like
the
one
nanny
corey
had
on
o
my
lord
groaned
lapham
it
been
pen
from
the
start
i
guess
or
almost
from
the
start
i
do
say
but
what
he
was
attracted
some
by
irene
at
the
very
first
but
i
guess
it
been
pen
ever
since
he
saw
her
and
we
taken
up
with
a
notion
and
blinded
ourselves
with
it
time
and
again
i
had
my
doubts
whether
he
cared
for
irene
any
but
i
declare
to
goodness
when
he
kept
coming
i
never
hardly
thought
of
pen
and
i
could
help
believing
at
last
he
did
care
for
irene
did
it
ever
strike
you
he
might
be
after
pen
no
i
took
what
you
said
i
supposed
you
knew
do
you
blame
me
silas
she
asked
timidly
no
what
the
use
of
blaming
we
do
either
of
us
want
anything
but
the
children
good
what
it
all
of
it
for
if
it
ai
for
that
that
what
we
both
slaved
for
all
our
lives
yes
i
know
plenty
of
people
lose
their
children
she
suggested
yes
but
that
do
comfort
me
any
i
never
was
one
to
feel
good
because
another
man
felt
bad
how
would
you
have
liked
it
if
some
one
had
taken
comfort
because
his
boy
lived
when
ours
died
no
i
ca
do
it
and
this
is
worse
than
death
someways
that
comes
and
it
goes
but
this
looks
as
if
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
had
come
to
stay
the
way
i
look
at
it
there
ai
any
hope
for
anybody
suppose
we
do
want
pen
to
have
him
will
that
help
irene
any
if
he
do
want
her
suppose
we
do
want
to
let
him
have
either
does
that
help
either
you
talk
exclaimed
lapham
as
if
our
say
was
going
to
settle
it
do
you
suppose
that
penelope
lapham
is
a
girl
to
take
up
with
a
fellow
that
her
sister
is
in
love
with
and
that
she
always
thought
was
in
love
with
her
sister
and
go
off
and
be
happy
with
him
do
you
believe
but
what
it
would
come
back
to
her
as
long
as
she
breathed
the
breath
of
life
how
she
teased
her
about
him
as
i
heard
pen
tease
irene
and
helped
to
make
her
think
he
was
in
love
with
her
by
showing
that
she
thought
so
herself
it
ridiculous
lapham
seemed
quite
beaten
down
by
this
argument
his
huge
head
hung
forward
over
his
breast
the
reins
lay
loose
in
his
moveless
hand
the
mare
took
her
own
way
at
last
he
lifted
his
face
and
shut
his
heavy
jaws
well
quavered
his
wife
well
he
answered
if
he
wants
her
and
she
wants
him
i
do
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
he
looked
straight
forward
and
not
at
his
wife
she
laid
her
hands
on
the
reins
now
you
stop
right
here
silas
lapham
if
i
thought
that
if
i
really
believed
you
could
be
willing
to
break
that
poor
child
heart
and
let
pen
disgrace
herself
by
marrying
a
man
that
had
as
good
as
killed
her
sister
just
because
you
wanted
bromfield
corey
son
for
a
lapham
turned
his
face
now
and
gave
her
a
look
you
had
better
not
believe
that
persis
get
up
he
called
to
the
mare
without
glancing
at
her
and
she
sprang
forward
i
see
you
got
past
being
any
use
to
yourself
on
this
subject
hello
shouted
a
voice
in
front
of
him
where
the
devil
you
to
do
you
want
to
kill
somebody
shrieked
his
wife
there
was
a
light
crash
and
the
mare
recoiled
her
length
and
separated
their
wheels
from
those
of
the
open
buggy
in
front
which
lapham
had
driven
into
he
made
his
excuses
to
the
occupant
and
the
accident
relieved
the
tension
of
their
feelings
and
left
them
far
from
the
point
of
mutual
injury
which
they
had
reached
in
their
common
trouble
and
their
unselfish
will
for
their
children
good
it
was
lapham
who
resumed
the
talk
i
afraid
we
ca
either
of
us
see
this
thing
in
the
right
light
we
too
near
to
it
i
wish
to
the
lord
there
was
somebody
to
talk
to
about
it
yes
said
his
wife
but
there
ai
anybody
well
i
dunno
suggested
lapham
after
a
moment
why
not
talk
to
the
minister
of
your
church
may
be
he
could
see
some
way
out
of
it
lapham
shook
her
head
hopelessly
it
would
do
i
never
taken
up
my
connection
with
the
church
and
i
do
feel
as
if
i
got
any
claim
on
him
if
he
anything
of
a
man
or
anything
of
a
preacher
you
have
got
a
claim
on
him
urged
lapham
and
he
spoiled
his
argument
by
adding
i
contributed
enough
money
to
his
church
oh
that
nothing
said
lapham
i
ai
well
enough
acquainted
with
langworthy
or
else
i
too
well
no
if
i
was
to
ask
any
one
i
should
want
to
ask
a
total
stranger
but
what
the
use
si
nobody
could
make
us
see
it
any
different
from
what
it
is
and
i
do
know
as
i
should
want
they
should
it
blotted
out
the
tender
beauty
of
the
day
and
weighed
down
their
hearts
ever
more
heavily
within
them
they
ceased
to
talk
of
it
a
hundred
times
and
still
came
back
to
it
they
drove
on
and
on
it
began
to
be
late
i
guess
we
better
go
back
si
said
his
wife
and
as
he
turned
without
speaking
she
pulled
her
veil
down
and
began
to
cry
softly
behind
it
with
low
little
broken
sobs
lapham
started
the
mare
up
and
drove
swiftly
homeward
at
last
his
wife
stopped
crying
and
began
trying
to
find
her
pocket
here
take
mine
persis
he
said
kindly
offering
her
his
handkerchief
and
she
took
it
and
dried
her
eyes
with
it
there
was
one
of
those
fellows
there
the
other
night
he
spoke
again
when
his
wife
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
in
peaceful
despair
that
i
liked
the
looks
of
about
as
well
as
any
man
i
ever
saw
i
guess
he
was
a
pretty
good
man
it
was
that
mr
sewell
he
looked
at
his
wife
but
she
did
not
say
anything
persis
he
resumed
i
ca
bear
to
go
back
with
nothing
settled
in
our
minds
i
ca
bear
to
let
you
we
must
si
returned
his
wife
with
gentle
gratitude
lapham
groaned
where
does
he
live
she
asked
on
bolingbroke
street
he
gave
me
his
number
well
it
would
do
any
good
what
could
he
say
to
us
oh
i
do
know
as
he
could
say
anything
said
lapham
hopelessly
and
neither
of
them
said
anything
more
till
they
crossed
the
milldam
and
found
themselves
between
the
rows
of
city
houses
do
drive
past
the
new
house
si
pleaded
his
wife
i
bear
to
see
it
drive
drive
up
bolingbroke
street
we
might
as
well
see
where
he
does
live
well
said
lapham
he
drove
along
slowly
that
the
place
he
said
finally
stopping
the
mare
and
pointing
with
his
whip
it
would
do
any
good
said
his
wife
in
a
tone
which
he
understood
as
well
as
he
understood
her
words
he
turned
the
mare
up
to
the
curbstone
you
take
the
reins
a
minute
he
said
handing
them
to
his
wife
he
got
down
and
rang
the
bell
and
waited
till
the
door
opened
then
he
came
back
and
lifted
his
wife
out
he
in
he
said
he
got
the
from
under
the
and
made
it
fast
to
the
mare
bit
do
you
think
she
stand
with
that
asked
lapham
i
guess
so
if
she
do
no
matter
ai
you
afraid
she
take
cold
she
persisted
trying
to
make
delay
let
her
said
lapham
he
took
his
wife
trembling
hand
under
his
arm
and
drew
her
to
the
door
he
think
we
crazy
she
murmured
in
her
broken
pride
well
we
are
said
lapham
tell
him
we
like
to
see
him
alone
a
while
he
said
to
the
girl
who
was
holding
the
door
ajar
for
him
and
she
showed
him
into
the
which
had
been
the
protestant
confessional
for
many
burdened
souls
before
their
time
coming
as
they
did
with
the
belief
that
they
were
bowed
down
with
the
only
misery
like
theirs
in
the
universe
for
each
one
of
us
must
suffer
long
to
himself
before
he
can
learn
that
he
is
but
one
in
a
great
community
of
wretchedness
which
has
been
pitilessly
repeating
itself
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
they
were
as
loath
to
touch
their
trouble
when
the
minister
came
in
as
if
it
were
their
disgrace
but
lapham
did
so
at
last
and
with
a
simple
dignity
which
he
had
wanted
in
his
bungling
and
apologetic
approaches
he
laid
the
affair
clearly
before
the
compassionate
and
reverent
eye
he
spared
corey
name
but
he
did
not
pretend
that
it
was
not
himself
and
his
wife
and
their
daughters
who
were
concerned
i
do
know
as
i
got
any
right
to
trouble
you
with
this
thing
he
said
in
the
moment
while
sewell
sat
pondering
the
case
and
i
know
as
i
got
any
warrant
for
doing
it
but
as
i
told
my
wife
here
there
was
something
about
you
i
do
know
whether
it
was
anything
you
said
exactly
that
made
me
feel
as
if
you
could
help
us
i
guess
i
did
say
so
much
as
that
to
her
but
that
the
way
i
felt
and
here
we
are
and
if
it
ai
all
right
surely
said
sewell
it
all
right
i
thank
you
for
coming
for
trusting
your
trouble
to
me
a
time
comes
to
every
one
of
us
when
we
ca
help
ourselves
and
then
we
must
get
others
to
help
us
if
people
turn
to
me
at
such
a
time
i
feel
sure
that
i
was
put
into
the
world
for
something
if
nothing
more
than
to
give
my
pity
my
sympathy
the
brotherly
words
so
plain
so
sincere
had
a
welcome
in
them
that
these
poor
outcasts
of
sorrow
could
not
doubt
yes
said
lapham
huskily
and
his
wife
began
to
wipe
the
tears
again
under
her
veil
sewell
remained
silent
and
they
waited
till
he
should
speak
we
can
be
of
use
to
one
another
here
because
we
can
always
be
wiser
for
some
one
else
than
we
can
for
ourselves
we
can
see
another
sins
and
errors
in
a
more
merciful
light
and
that
is
always
a
fairer
light
than
we
can
our
own
and
we
can
look
more
sanely
at
afflictions
he
had
addressed
these
words
to
lapham
now
he
turned
to
his
wife
if
some
one
had
come
to
you
lapham
in
just
this
perplexity
what
would
you
have
thought
i
do
know
as
i
understand
you
faltered
lapham
sewell
repeated
his
words
and
added
i
mean
what
do
you
think
some
one
else
ought
to
do
in
your
place
was
there
ever
any
poor
creatures
in
such
a
strait
before
she
asked
with
pathetic
incredulity
there
no
new
trouble
under
the
sun
said
the
minister
oh
if
it
was
any
one
else
i
should
say
i
should
say
why
of
course
i
should
say
that
their
duty
was
to
let
she
paused
one
suffer
instead
of
three
if
none
is
to
blame
suggested
sewell
that
sense
and
that
justice
it
the
economy
of
pain
which
naturally
suggests
itself
and
which
would
insist
upon
itself
if
we
were
not
all
perverted
by
traditions
which
are
the
figment
of
the
shallowest
sentimentality
tell
me
lapham
did
this
come
into
your
mind
when
you
first
learned
how
matters
stood
why
yes
it
flashed
across
me
but
i
did
think
it
could
be
right
and
how
was
it
with
you
mr
lapham
why
that
what
i
thought
of
course
but
i
did
see
my
way
no
cried
the
minister
we
are
all
blinded
we
are
all
weakened
by
a
false
ideal
of
it
wraps
us
round
with
its
meshes
and
we
ca
fight
our
way
out
of
it
lapham
what
made
you
feel
that
it
might
be
better
for
three
to
suffer
than
one
why
she
did
herself
i
know
she
would
die
sooner
than
take
him
away
from
her
i
supposed
so
cried
the
minister
bitterly
and
yet
she
is
a
sensible
girl
your
daughter
she
has
more
of
course
but
in
such
a
case
we
somehow
think
it
must
be
wrong
to
use
our
i
do
know
where
this
false
ideal
comes
from
unless
it
comes
from
the
novels
that
befool
and
debauch
almost
every
intelligence
in
some
degree
it
certainly
does
come
from
christianity
which
instantly
repudiates
it
when
confronted
with
it
your
daughter
believes
in
spite
of
her
that
she
ought
to
make
herself
and
the
man
who
loves
her
unhappy
in
order
to
assure
the
wretchedness
of
her
sister
whom
he
does
love
simply
because
her
sister
saw
him
and
fancied
him
first
and
i
sorry
to
say
that
young
people
out
of
a
hundred
oh
nine
hundred
and
out
of
a
thousand
would
consider
that
noble
and
beautiful
and
heroic
whereas
you
know
at
the
bottom
of
your
hearts
that
it
would
be
foolish
and
cruel
and
revolting
you
know
what
marriage
is
and
what
it
must
be
without
love
on
both
sides
the
minister
had
grown
quite
heated
and
red
in
the
face
i
lose
all
patience
he
went
on
vehemently
this
poor
child
of
yours
has
somehow
been
brought
to
believe
that
it
will
kill
her
sister
if
her
sister
does
not
have
what
does
not
belong
to
her
and
what
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
all
the
world
or
any
soul
in
the
world
to
give
her
her
sister
will
suffer
yes
keenly
in
heart
and
in
pride
but
she
will
not
die
you
will
suffer
too
in
your
tenderness
for
her
but
you
must
do
your
duty
you
must
help
her
to
give
up
you
would
be
guilty
if
you
did
less
keep
clearly
in
mind
that
you
are
doing
right
and
the
only
possible
good
and
god
be
with
you
xix
he
talked
sense
persis
said
lapham
gently
as
he
mounted
to
his
wife
side
in
the
buggy
and
drove
slowly
homeward
through
the
dusk
yes
he
talked
sense
she
admitted
but
she
added
bitterly
i
guess
if
he
had
it
to
do
oh
he
right
and
it
got
to
be
done
there
ai
any
other
way
for
it
it
sense
and
yes
it
justice
they
walked
to
their
door
after
they
left
the
horse
at
the
livery
stable
around
the
corner
where
lapham
kept
it
i
want
you
should
send
irene
up
to
our
room
as
soon
as
we
get
in
silas
why
ai
you
going
to
have
any
supper
first
faltered
lapham
with
his
in
the
lock
no
i
ca
lose
a
minute
if
i
do
i
sha
do
it
at
all
look
here
persis
said
her
husband
tenderly
let
me
do
this
thing
oh
you
said
his
wife
with
a
woman
compassionate
scorn
for
a
man
helplessness
in
such
a
case
send
her
right
up
and
i
shall
feel
she
stopped
to
spare
him
then
she
opened
the
door
and
ran
up
to
her
room
without
waiting
to
speak
to
irene
who
had
come
into
the
hall
at
the
sound
of
her
key
in
the
door
i
guess
your
mother
wants
to
see
you
upstairs
said
lapham
looking
away
her
mother
turned
round
and
faced
the
girl
wondering
look
as
irene
entered
the
chamber
so
close
upon
her
that
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
lay
off
her
bonnet
she
stood
with
her
wraps
still
on
her
arm
irene
she
said
harshly
there
is
something
you
have
got
to
bear
it
a
mistake
we
all
made
he
do
care
anything
for
you
he
never
did
he
told
pen
so
last
night
he
cares
for
her
the
sentences
had
fallen
like
blows
but
the
girl
had
taken
them
without
flinching
she
stood
up
immovable
but
the
delicate
of
her
complexion
went
out
and
left
her
colourless
she
did
not
offer
to
speak
why
do
you
say
something
cried
her
mother
do
you
want
to
kill
me
irene
why
should
i
want
to
hurt
you
mamma
the
girl
replied
steadily
but
in
an
alien
voice
there
nothing
to
say
i
want
to
see
pen
a
minute
she
turned
and
left
the
room
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
that
led
to
her
own
and
her
sister
rooms
on
the
floor
above
her
mother
helplessly
followed
irene
went
first
to
her
own
room
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
then
came
out
leaving
the
door
open
and
the
gas
flaring
behind
her
the
mother
could
see
that
she
had
tumbled
many
things
out
of
the
drawers
of
her
bureau
upon
the
marble
top
she
passed
her
mother
where
she
stood
in
the
entry
you
can
come
too
if
you
want
to
mamma
she
said
she
opened
penelope
door
without
knocking
and
went
in
penelope
sat
at
the
window
as
in
the
morning
irene
did
not
go
to
her
but
she
went
and
laid
a
gold
on
her
bureau
and
said
without
looking
at
her
there
a
pin
that
i
got
because
it
was
like
his
sister
it
wo
become
a
dark
person
so
well
but
you
can
have
it
she
stuck
a
scrap
of
paper
in
the
side
of
penelope
mirror
that
account
of
stanton
ranch
you
want
to
read
it
i
presume
she
laid
a
withered
boutonniere
on
the
bureau
beside
the
pin
his
bouquet
he
left
it
by
his
plate
and
i
stole
it
she
had
a
fantastically
tied
up
with
a
knot
of
ribbon
in
her
hand
she
held
it
a
moment
then
looking
deliberately
at
penelope
she
went
up
to
her
and
dropped
it
in
her
lap
without
a
word
she
turned
and
advancing
a
few
steps
tottered
and
seemed
about
to
fall
her
mother
sprang
forward
with
an
imploring
cry
o
irene
recovered
herself
before
her
mother
could
reach
her
touch
me
she
said
icily
mamma
i
going
to
put
on
my
things
i
want
papa
to
walk
with
me
i
choking
here
i
i
ca
let
you
go
out
irene
child
began
her
mother
you
got
to
replied
the
girl
tell
papa
ta
hurry
his
supper
o
poor
soul
he
does
want
any
supper
he
knows
it
too
i
do
want
to
talk
about
that
tell
him
to
get
ready
she
left
them
once
more
lapham
turned
a
hapless
glance
upon
penelope
go
and
tell
him
mother
said
the
girl
i
would
if
i
could
if
she
can
walk
let
her
it
the
only
thing
for
her
she
sat
still
she
did
not
even
brush
to
the
floor
the
fantastic
thing
that
lay
in
her
lap
and
that
sent
up
faintly
the
odour
of
the
sachet
powder
with
which
irene
liked
to
perfume
her
boxes
lapham
went
out
with
the
unhappy
child
and
began
to
talk
with
her
crazily
incoherently
enough
she
mercifully
stopped
him
do
talk
papa
i
do
want
any
one
should
talk
with
me
he
obeyed
and
they
walked
silently
on
and
on
in
their
aimless
course
they
reached
the
new
house
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
and
she
made
him
stop
and
stood
looking
up
at
it
the
scaffolding
which
had
so
long
defaced
the
front
was
gone
and
in
the
light
of
the
before
it
all
the
architectural
beauty
of
the
facade
was
suggested
and
much
of
the
finely
felt
detail
was
revealed
seymour
had
pretty
nearly
satisfied
himself
in
that
rich
facade
certainly
lapham
had
not
stinted
him
of
the
means
well
said
the
girl
i
shall
never
live
in
it
and
she
began
to
walk
on
lapham
sore
heart
went
down
as
he
lumbered
heavily
after
her
oh
yes
you
will
irene
you
have
lots
of
good
times
there
yet
no
she
answered
and
said
nothing
more
about
it
they
had
not
talked
of
their
trouble
at
all
and
they
did
not
speak
of
it
now
lapham
understood
that
she
was
trying
to
walk
herself
weary
and
he
was
glad
to
hold
his
peace
and
let
her
have
her
way
she
halted
him
once
more
before
the
red
and
yellow
lights
of
an
apothecary
window
is
there
something
they
give
you
to
make
you
sleep
she
asked
vaguely
i
got
to
sleep
lapham
trembled
i
guess
you
do
want
anything
irene
yes
i
do
get
me
something
she
retorted
wilfully
if
you
do
i
shall
die
i
must
sleep
they
went
in
and
lapham
asked
for
something
to
make
a
nervous
person
sleep
irene
stood
poring
over
the
full
of
brushes
and
trinkets
while
the
apothecary
put
up
the
bromide
which
he
guessed
would
be
about
the
best
thing
she
did
not
show
any
emotion
her
face
was
like
a
stone
while
her
father
expressed
the
anguish
of
his
sympathy
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
slept
for
a
week
his
fat
eyelids
drooped
over
his
glassy
eyes
and
his
cheeks
and
throat
hung
flaccid
he
started
as
the
apothecary
cat
stole
smoothly
up
and
rubbed
itself
against
his
leg
and
it
was
to
him
that
the
man
said
you
want
to
take
a
of
that
as
long
as
you
awake
i
guess
it
take
a
great
many
to
fetch
you
all
right
said
lapham
and
paid
and
went
out
i
do
know
but
i
shall
want
some
of
it
he
said
with
a
joyless
laugh
irene
came
closer
up
to
him
and
took
his
arm
he
laid
his
heavy
paw
on
her
gloved
fingers
after
a
while
she
said
i
want
you
should
let
me
go
up
to
lapham
to
lapham
why
sunday
irene
you
ca
go
well
monday
then
i
can
live
through
one
day
here
well
said
the
father
passively
he
made
no
pretence
of
asking
her
why
she
wished
to
go
nor
any
attempt
to
dissuade
her
give
me
that
bottle
she
said
when
he
opened
the
door
at
home
for
her
and
she
ran
up
to
her
own
room
the
next
morning
irene
came
to
breakfast
with
her
mother
the
colonel
and
penelope
did
not
appear
and
lapham
looked
and
careworn
the
girl
glanced
at
her
do
you
fret
about
me
mamma
she
said
i
shall
get
along
she
seemed
herself
as
steady
and
strong
as
rock
i
do
like
to
see
you
keeping
up
so
irene
replied
her
mother
it
be
all
the
worse
for
you
when
you
do
break
better
give
way
a
little
at
the
start
i
sha
break
and
i
given
way
all
i
going
to
i
going
to
lapham
i
want
you
should
go
with
me
mamma
and
i
guess
i
can
keep
up
one
day
here
all
about
it
is
i
do
want
you
should
say
anything
or
look
anything
and
whatever
i
do
i
do
want
you
should
try
to
stop
me
and
the
first
thing
i
going
to
take
her
breakfast
up
to
her
do
she
cried
intercepting
the
protest
on
her
mother
lips
i
shall
not
let
it
hurt
pen
if
i
can
help
it
she
never
done
a
thing
nor
thought
a
thing
to
wrong
me
i
had
to
fly
out
at
her
last
night
but
that
all
over
now
and
i
know
just
what
i
got
to
bear
she
had
her
way
unmolested
she
carried
penelope
breakfast
to
her
and
omitted
no
care
or
attention
that
could
make
the
sacrifice
complete
with
an
heroic
pretence
that
she
was
performing
no
unusual
service
they
did
not
speak
beyond
her
saying
in
a
clear
dry
note
here
your
breakfast
pen
and
her
sister
answering
hoarsely
and
tremulously
oh
thank
you
irene
and
though
two
or
three
times
they
turned
their
faces
toward
each
other
while
irene
remained
in
the
room
mechanically
putting
its
confusion
to
rights
their
eyes
did
not
meet
then
irene
descended
upon
the
other
rooms
which
she
set
in
order
and
some
of
which
she
fiercely
swept
and
dusted
she
made
the
beds
and
she
sent
the
two
servants
away
to
church
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
their
breakfast
telling
them
that
she
would
wash
their
dishes
throughout
the
morning
her
father
and
mother
heard
her
about
the
work
of
getting
dinner
with
certain
silences
which
represented
the
moments
when
she
stopped
and
stood
and
then
readjusting
her
burden
forced
herself
forward
under
it
again
they
sat
alone
in
the
family
room
out
of
which
their
two
girls
seemed
to
have
died
lapham
could
not
read
his
sunday
papers
and
she
had
no
heart
to
go
to
church
as
she
would
have
done
earlier
in
life
when
in
trouble
just
then
she
was
obscurely
feeling
that
the
church
was
somehow
to
blame
for
that
counsel
of
sewell
on
which
they
had
acted
i
should
like
to
know
she
said
having
brought
the
matter
up
whether
he
would
have
thought
it
was
such
a
light
matter
if
it
had
been
his
own
children
do
you
suppose
he
have
been
so
ready
to
act
on
his
own
advice
if
it
had
been
he
told
us
the
right
thing
to
do
persis
the
only
thing
we
could
let
it
go
on
urged
her
husband
gently
well
it
makes
me
despise
pen
irene
showing
twice
the
character
that
she
is
this
very
minute
the
mother
said
this
so
that
the
father
might
defend
her
daughter
to
her
he
did
not
fail
irene
got
the
easiest
part
the
way
i
look
at
it
and
you
see
that
pen
know
how
to
behave
when
the
time
comes
what
do
you
want
she
should
do
i
have
got
so
far
as
that
yet
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
irene
what
do
you
want
pen
should
do
repeated
lapham
when
it
comes
to
it
well
i
do
want
she
should
take
him
for
one
thing
said
lapham
this
seemed
to
satisfy
lapham
as
to
her
husband
and
she
said
in
defence
of
corey
why
i
do
see
what
he
done
it
all
been
our
doing
never
mind
that
now
what
about
irene
she
says
she
going
to
lapham
she
feels
that
she
got
to
get
away
somewhere
it
natural
she
should
yes
and
i
presume
it
will
be
about
the
best
thing
for
her
shall
you
go
with
her
yes
well
he
comfortlessly
took
up
a
newspaper
again
and
she
rose
with
a
sigh
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
some
things
for
the
morrow
journey
after
dinner
when
irene
had
cleared
away
the
last
trace
of
it
in
kitchen
and
with
unsparing
punctilio
she
came
downstairs
dressed
to
go
out
and
bade
her
father
come
to
walk
with
her
again
it
was
a
repetition
of
the
aimlessness
of
the
last
night
wanderings
they
came
back
and
she
got
tea
for
them
and
after
that
they
heard
her
stirring
about
in
her
own
room
as
if
she
were
busy
about
many
things
but
they
did
not
dare
to
look
in
upon
her
even
after
all
the
noises
had
ceased
and
they
knew
she
had
gone
to
bed
yes
it
a
thing
she
got
to
fight
out
by
herself
said
mrs
lapham
i
guess
she
get
along
said
lapham
but
i
do
want
you
should
misjudge
pen
either
she
all
right
too
she
ai
to
blame
yes
i
know
but
i
ca
work
round
to
it
all
at
once
i
misjudge
her
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
get
over
it
right
away
mamma
said
irene
when
she
was
hurrying
their
departure
the
next
morning
what
did
she
tell
him
when
he
asked
her
tell
him
echoed
the
mother
and
after
a
while
she
added
she
tell
him
anything
did
she
say
anything
about
me
she
said
he
must
come
here
any
more
irene
turned
and
went
into
her
sister
room
pen
she
said
kissing
her
with
an
effect
of
not
seeing
or
touching
her
i
want
you
should
tell
him
all
about
it
if
he
half
a
man
he
give
up
till
he
knows
why
you
wo
have
him
and
he
has
a
right
to
know
it
would
make
any
difference
i
could
have
him
after
that
for
you
to
say
but
if
you
do
tell
him
about
me
i
will
yes
you
need
say
i
cared
for
him
but
you
can
say
that
you
all
thought
he
cared
for
me
o
irene
do
irene
escaped
from
the
arms
that
tried
to
cast
themselves
about
her
you
are
all
right
pen
you
have
done
anything
you
helped
me
all
you
could
but
i
ca
yet
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
summoned
lapham
with
a
sharp
now
mamma
and
went
on
putting
the
last
things
into
her
trunks
the
colonel
went
to
the
station
with
them
and
put
them
on
the
train
he
got
them
a
little
compartment
to
themselves
in
the
pullman
car
and
as
he
stood
leaning
with
his
lifted
hands
against
the
sides
of
the
doorway
he
tried
to
say
something
consoling
and
hopeful
i
guess
you
have
an
easy
ride
irene
i
do
believe
it
be
dusty
any
after
the
rain
last
night
do
you
stay
till
the
train
starts
papa
returned
the
girl
in
rigid
rejection
of
his
futilities
get
off
now
well
if
you
want
i
should
he
said
glad
to
be
able
to
please
her
in
anything
he
remained
on
the
platform
till
the
cars
started
he
saw
irene
bustling
about
in
the
compartment
making
her
mother
comfortable
for
the
journey
but
lapham
did
not
lift
her
head
the
train
moved
off
and
he
went
heavily
back
to
his
business
from
time
to
time
during
the
day
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
corey
tried
to
make
out
from
his
face
whether
he
knew
what
had
taken
place
between
him
and
penelope
when
rogers
came
in
about
time
of
closing
and
shut
himself
up
with
lapham
in
his
room
the
young
man
remained
till
the
two
came
out
together
and
parted
in
their
salutationless
fashion
lapham
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
corey
still
there
and
merely
answered
well
when
the
young
man
said
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
and
led
the
way
back
to
his
room
corey
shut
the
door
behind
them
i
only
wish
to
speak
to
you
in
case
you
know
of
the
matter
already
for
otherwise
i
bound
by
a
promise
i
guess
i
know
what
you
mean
it
about
penelope
yes
it
about
miss
lapham
i
am
greatly
attached
to
her
excuse
my
saying
it
i
could
excuse
myself
if
i
were
not
perfectly
excusable
said
lapham
it
all
right
oh
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
cried
the
young
fellow
joyfully
i
want
you
to
believe
that
this
is
a
new
thing
or
an
unconsidered
thing
with
me
though
it
seemed
so
unexpected
to
her
lapham
fetched
a
deep
sigh
it
all
right
as
far
as
concerned
or
her
mother
we
both
liked
you
yes
but
there
seems
to
be
something
in
penelope
mind
i
do
know
the
colonel
consciously
dropped
his
eyes
she
referred
to
something
i
could
make
out
what
but
i
hoped
i
hoped
that
with
your
leave
i
might
overcome
it
the
barrier
whatever
it
was
miss
lapham
penelope
gave
me
the
hope
that
i
was
was
indifferent
to
her
yes
i
guess
that
so
said
lapham
he
suddenly
lifted
his
head
and
confronted
the
young
fellow
honest
face
with
his
own
face
so
different
in
its
honesty
sure
you
never
made
up
to
any
one
else
at
the
same
time
never
who
could
imagine
such
a
thing
if
that
all
i
can
easily
i
do
say
that
all
nor
that
that
it
i
do
want
you
should
go
upon
that
idea
i
just
thought
may
be
you
had
thought
of
it
no
i
certainly
had
thought
of
it
such
a
thing
would
have
been
so
impossible
to
me
that
i
could
have
thought
of
it
and
it
so
shocking
to
me
now
that
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
it
well
do
take
it
too
much
to
heart
said
lapham
alarmed
at
the
feeling
he
had
excited
i
do
say
she
thought
so
i
was
trying
to
guess
trying
to
if
there
is
anything
i
can
say
or
do
to
convince
you
oh
it
ai
necessary
to
say
anything
i
all
right
but
miss
lapham
i
may
see
her
again
i
may
try
to
convince
her
that
he
stopped
in
distress
and
lapham
afterwards
told
his
wife
that
he
kept
seeing
the
face
of
irene
as
it
looked
when
he
parted
with
her
in
the
car
and
whenever
he
was
going
to
say
yes
he
could
not
open
his
lips
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
penelope
had
a
right
to
what
was
her
own
and
sewell
words
came
back
to
him
besides
they
had
already
put
irene
to
the
worst
suffering
lapham
compromised
as
he
imagined
you
can
come
round
and
see
me
if
you
want
to
he
said
and
he
bore
grimly
the
gratitude
that
the
young
man
poured
out
upon
him
penelope
came
down
to
supper
and
took
her
mother
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
lapham
sat
silent
in
her
presence
as
long
as
he
could
bear
it
then
he
asked
how
do
you
feel
pen
oh
like
a
thief
said
the
girl
a
thief
that
has
been
arrested
yet
lapham
waited
a
while
before
he
said
well
now
your
mother
and
i
want
you
should
hold
up
on
that
a
while
it
is
for
you
to
say
it
something
i
ca
hold
up
on
yes
i
guess
you
can
if
i
know
what
happened
then
what
happened
is
a
thing
that
nobody
is
to
blame
for
and
we
want
you
should
make
the
best
of
it
and
not
the
worst
heigh
it
ai
going
to
help
irene
any
for
you
to
hurt
yourself
or
anybody
else
and
i
do
want
you
should
take
up
with
any
such
crazy
notion
as
far
as
heard
from
you
have
stolen
anything
and
whatever
you
got
belongs
to
you
has
he
been
speaking
to
you
father
your
mother
been
speaking
to
me
has
he
been
speaking
to
you
that
neither
here
nor
there
then
he
broken
his
word
and
i
will
never
speak
to
him
again
if
he
was
any
such
fool
as
to
promise
that
he
would
talk
to
me
on
a
subject
lapham
drew
a
deep
breath
and
then
made
the
plunge
that
i
brought
up
did
you
bring
it
up
the
same
as
brought
up
the
quicker
he
broke
his
word
the
better
and
i
want
you
should
act
upon
that
idea
recollect
that
it
my
business
and
your
mother
business
as
well
as
yours
and
we
going
to
have
our
say
he
hai
done
anything
wrong
pen
nor
anything
that
going
to
be
punished
for
understand
that
he
got
to
have
a
reason
if
you
not
going
to
have
him
i
do
say
you
got
to
have
him
i
want
you
should
feel
perfectly
free
about
that
but
i
do
say
you
got
to
give
him
a
reason
is
he
coming
here
i
do
know
as
you
call
it
coming
yes
you
do
father
said
the
girl
in
forlorn
amusement
at
his
shuffling
he
coming
here
to
see
me
when
he
coming
i
do
know
but
he
coming
and
you
want
i
should
see
him
i
do
know
but
you
better
all
right
i
see
him
lapham
drew
a
long
deep
breath
of
suspicion
inspired
by
this
acquiescence
what
you
going
to
do
he
asked
presently
i
do
know
yet
answered
the
girl
sadly
it
depends
a
good
deal
upon
what
he
does
well
said
lapham
with
the
hungriness
of
unsatisfied
anxiety
in
his
tone
when
corey
card
was
brought
into
the
where
he
and
penelope
were
sitting
he
went
into
the
parlour
to
find
him
i
guess
penelope
wants
to
see
you
he
said
and
indicating
the
he
added
she
in
there
and
did
not
go
back
himself
corey
made
his
way
to
the
girl
presence
with
open
trepidation
which
was
not
allayed
by
her
silence
and
languor
she
sat
in
the
chair
where
she
had
sat
the
other
night
but
she
was
not
playing
with
a
fan
now
he
came
toward
her
and
then
stood
faltering
a
faint
smile
quivered
over
her
face
at
the
spectacle
of
his
subjection
sit
down
corey
she
said
there
no
reason
why
we
should
talk
it
over
quietly
for
i
know
you
will
think
i
right
i
sure
of
that
he
answered
hopefully
when
i
saw
that
your
father
knew
of
it
i
asked
him
to
let
me
see
you
again
afraid
that
i
broke
my
promise
to
you
technically
it
had
to
be
broken
he
took
more
courage
at
her
words
but
only
come
to
do
whatever
you
say
and
not
to
be
an
annoyance
to
you
yes
you
have
to
know
but
i
could
tell
you
before
now
they
all
think
i
should
a
tremor
of
anxiety
passed
over
the
young
man
face
on
which
she
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
we
supposed
it
it
was
irene
he
remained
blank
a
moment
and
then
he
said
with
a
smile
of
relief
of
deprecation
of
protest
of
amazement
of
compassion
oh
never
never
for
an
instant
how
could
you
think
such
a
thing
it
was
impossible
i
never
thought
of
her
but
i
see
i
see
i
can
explain
no
there
nothing
to
explain
i
have
never
knowingly
done
or
said
a
thing
from
first
to
last
to
make
you
think
that
i
see
how
terrible
it
is
he
said
but
he
still
smiled
as
if
he
could
not
take
it
seriously
i
admired
her
beauty
who
could
help
doing
that
and
i
thought
her
very
good
and
sensible
why
last
winter
in
texas
i
told
stanton
about
our
meeting
in
canada
and
we
agreed
i
only
tell
you
to
show
you
how
far
i
always
was
from
what
you
thought
that
he
must
come
north
and
try
to
see
her
and
and
of
course
it
all
sounds
very
silly
and
he
sent
her
a
newspaper
with
an
account
of
his
ranch
in
it
she
thought
it
came
from
you
oh
good
heavens
he
did
tell
me
till
after
he
done
it
but
he
did
it
for
a
part
of
our
foolish
joke
and
when
i
met
your
sister
again
i
only
admired
her
as
before
i
can
see
now
how
i
must
have
seemed
to
be
seeking
her
out
but
it
was
to
talk
of
you
with
her
i
never
talked
of
anything
else
if
i
could
help
it
except
when
i
changed
the
subject
because
i
was
ashamed
to
be
always
talking
of
you
i
see
how
distressing
it
is
for
all
of
you
but
tell
me
that
you
believe
me
yes
i
must
it
all
been
our
mistake
it
has
indeed
but
there
no
mistake
about
my
loving
you
penelope
he
said
and
the
name
at
which
she
had
often
mocked
was
sweet
to
her
from
his
lips
that
only
makes
it
worse
she
answered
oh
no
he
gently
protested
it
makes
it
better
it
makes
it
right
how
is
it
worse
how
is
it
wrong
ca
you
see
you
must
understand
all
now
do
you
see
that
if
she
believed
so
too
and
if
she
she
could
not
go
on
did
she
did
your
sister
think
that
too
gasped
corey
she
used
to
talk
with
me
about
you
and
when
you
say
you
care
for
me
now
it
makes
me
feel
like
the
vilest
hypocrite
in
the
world
that
day
you
gave
her
the
list
of
books
and
she
came
down
to
nantasket
and
went
on
about
you
i
helped
her
to
flatter
herself
oh
i
do
see
how
she
can
forgive
me
but
she
knows
i
can
never
forgive
myself
the
reason
she
can
do
it
i
can
see
now
she
went
on
how
i
must
have
been
trying
to
get
you
from
her
i
ca
endure
it
the
only
way
is
for
me
never
to
see
you
or
speak
to
you
again
she
laughed
forlornly
that
would
be
pretty
hard
on
you
if
you
cared
i
do
care
all
the
world
well
then
it
would
if
you
were
going
to
keep
on
caring
you
long
if
you
stop
coming
now
is
this
all
then
is
it
the
end
it
whatever
it
is
i
ca
get
over
the
thought
of
her
once
i
thought
i
could
but
now
i
see
that
i
ca
it
seems
to
grow
worse
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
it
would
drive
me
crazy
he
sat
looking
at
her
with
lacklustre
eyes
the
light
suddenly
came
back
into
them
do
you
think
i
could
love
you
if
you
had
been
false
to
her
i
know
you
have
been
true
to
her
and
truer
still
to
yourself
i
never
tried
to
see
her
except
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
too
i
supposed
she
must
know
that
i
was
in
love
with
you
from
the
first
time
i
saw
you
there
that
afternoon
you
filled
my
fancy
do
you
think
i
was
flirting
with
the
child
or
no
you
do
think
that
we
have
not
done
wrong
we
have
not
harmed
any
one
knowingly
we
have
a
right
to
each
other
no
no
you
must
never
speak
to
me
of
this
again
if
you
do
i
shall
know
that
you
despise
me
but
how
will
that
help
her
i
do
love
her
do
say
that
to
me
i
have
said
that
to
myself
too
much
if
you
forbid
me
to
love
you
it
wo
make
me
love
her
he
persisted
she
was
about
to
speak
but
she
caught
her
breath
without
doing
so
and
merely
stared
at
him
i
must
do
what
you
say
he
continued
but
what
good
will
it
do
her
you
ca
make
her
happy
by
making
yourself
unhappy
do
you
ask
me
to
profit
by
a
wrong
not
for
the
world
but
there
is
no
wrong
there
is
something
i
do
know
what
there
a
wall
between
us
i
shall
dash
myself
against
it
as
long
as
i
live
but
that
wo
break
it
oh
he
groaned
we
have
done
no
wrong
why
should
we
suffer
from
another
mistake
as
if
it
were
our
sin
i
do
know
but
we
must
suffer
well
then
i
will
not
for
my
part
and
i
will
not
let
you
if
you
care
for
me
you
had
no
right
to
know
it
you
make
it
my
privilege
to
keep
you
from
doing
wrong
for
the
sake
i
sorry
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
for
this
error
but
i
ca
blame
myself
and
i
wo
deny
myself
the
happiness
i
done
anything
to
forfeit
i
will
never
give
you
up
i
will
wait
as
long
as
you
please
for
the
time
when
you
shall
feel
free
from
this
mistake
but
you
shall
be
mine
at
last
remember
that
i
might
go
away
for
months
a
year
even
but
that
seems
a
cowardly
and
guilty
thing
and
i
not
afraid
and
i
not
guilty
and
i
going
to
stay
here
and
try
to
see
you
she
shook
her
head
it
wo
change
anything
do
you
see
that
there
no
hope
for
us
when
is
she
coming
back
he
asked
i
do
know
mother
wants
father
to
come
and
take
her
out
west
for
a
while
she
up
there
in
the
country
with
your
mother
yet
yes
he
was
silent
then
he
said
desperately
penelope
she
is
very
young
and
perhaps
perhaps
she
might
meet
it
would
make
no
difference
it
would
change
it
for
me
you
are
cruel
cruel
to
yourself
if
you
love
me
and
cruel
to
me
do
you
remember
that
night
before
i
spoke
you
were
talking
of
that
book
and
you
said
it
was
foolish
and
wicked
to
do
as
that
girl
did
why
is
it
different
with
you
except
that
you
give
me
nothing
and
can
never
give
me
anything
when
you
take
yourself
away
if
it
were
anybody
else
i
am
sure
you
would
say
but
it
is
anybody
else
and
that
makes
it
impossible
sometimes
i
think
it
might
be
if
i
would
only
say
so
to
myself
and
then
all
that
i
said
to
her
about
you
comes
up
i
will
wait
it
ca
always
come
up
i
wo
urge
you
any
longer
now
but
you
will
see
it
differently
more
clearly
no
good
night
i
shall
come
again
it
will
surely
come
right
and
whatever
happens
you
have
done
no
wrong
try
to
keep
that
in
mind
i
am
so
happy
in
spite
of
all
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
put
it
behind
her
no
no
i
let
you
yet
xx
after
a
week
lapham
returned
leaving
irene
alone
at
the
old
homestead
in
vermont
she
comfortable
there
as
comfortable
as
she
can
be
anywheres
i
guess
she
said
to
her
husband
as
they
drove
together
from
the
station
where
he
had
met
her
in
obedience
to
her
telegraphic
summons
she
keeps
herself
busy
helping
about
the
house
and
she
goes
round
amongst
the
hands
in
their
houses
sickness
and
you
know
how
helpful
she
is
where
there
sickness
she
do
complain
any
i
do
know
as
i
heard
a
word
out
of
her
mouth
since
we
left
home
but
i
afraid
it
wear
on
her
silas
you
do
look
over
and
above
well
yourself
persis
said
her
husband
kindly
oh

talk
about
me
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether

the
time
to
run

to
you
about

take
the
man
that
we
all
thought
wanted
her
sister
i
ca
make
it
seem
right
it
right
said
lapham
stoutly
but
i
guess
she
ai
willing
i
wish
she
was
but
there
do
seem
to
be
any
way
out
of
the
thing
anywhere
it
a
perfect
snarl
but
i
do
want
you
should
be
anyways
with
pen
lapham
answered
nothing
but
when
she
met
penelope
she
gave
the
girl
wan
face
a
sharp
look
and
began
to
whimper
on
her
neck
penelope
tears
were
all
spent
well
mother
she
said
you
come
back
almost
as
cheerful
as
you
went
away
i
need
ask
if
in
good
spirits
we
all
seem
to
be
overflowing
with
them
i
suppose
this
is
one
way
of
congratulating
me
corey
has
been
round
to
do
it
yet
are
you
are
you
engaged
to
him
pen
gasped
her
mother
judging
by
my
feelings
i
should
say
not
i
feel
as
if
it
was
a
last
will
and
testament
but
you
better
ask
him
when
he
comes
i
ca
bear
to
look
at
him
i
guess
he
used
to
that
he
do
seem
to
expect
to
be
looked
at
well
we
all
just
where
we
started
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
keep
up
lapham
reported
to
her
husband
when
he
came
home
at
night
he
had
left
his
business
to
go
and
meet
her
and
then
after
a
desolate
dinner
at
the
house
had
returned
to
the
office
again
that
penelope
was
fully
as
bad
as
irene
and
she
do
know
how
to
work
it
off
irene
keeps
doing
but
pen
just
sits
in
her
room
and
mopes
she
do
even
read
i
went
up
this
afternoon
to
scold
her
about
the
state
the
house
was
in
you
can
see
that
irene
away
by
the
perfect
mess
but
when
i
saw
her
through
the
crack
of
the
door
i
had
the
heart
she
sat
there
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
just
staring
and
my
goodness
she
jumped
so
when
she
saw
me
and
then
she
fell
back
and
began
to
laugh
and
said
she
thought
it
was
my
ghost
mother
i
felt
as
if
i
should
give
way
lapham
listened
jadedly
and
answered
far
from
the
point
i
guess
i
got
to
start
out
there
pretty
soon
persis
how
soon
well
morning
lapham
sat
silent
then
all
right
she
said
i
get
you
ready
i
shall
run
up
to
lapham
for
irene
and
then
i
push
on
through
canada
i
can
get
there
about
as
quick
is
it
anything
you
can
tell
me
about
silas
yes
said
lapham
but
it
a
long
story
and
i
guess
you
got
your
hands
pretty
full
as
it
is
i
been
throwing
good
money
after
bad
the
usual
way
and
now
i
got
to
see
if
i
can
save
the
pieces
after
a
moment
lapham
asked
is
it
rogers
it
rogers
i
did
want
you
should
get
in
any
deeper
with
him
no
you
did
want
i
should
press
him
either
and
i
had
to
do
one
or
the
other
and
so
i
got
in
deeper
silas
said
his
wife
i
afraid
i
made
you
it
all
right
persis
as
far
forth
as
that
goes
i
was
glad
to
make
it
up
with
him
i
jumped
at
the
chance
i
guess
rogers
saw
that
he
had
a
soft
thing
in
me
and
he
worked
it
for
all
it
was
worth
but
all
come
out
right
in
the
end
lapham
said
this
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
talk
any
more
about
it
he
added
casually
pretty
near
everybody
but
the
fellows
that
owe
me
seem
to
expect
me
to
do
a
cash
business
all
of
a
sudden
do
you
mean
that
you
got
payments
to
make
and
that
people
are
not
paying
you
lapham
winced
a
little
something
like
that
he
said
and
he
lighted
a
cigar
but
when
i
tell
you
it
all
right
i
mean
it
persis
i
ai
going
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
though
especially
while
rogers
digs
the
ground
away
from
the
roots
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
it
has
to
come
to
that
i
going
to
squeeze
him
countenance
lighted
up
with
greater
joy
than
had
yet
visited
it
since
the
day
they
had
driven
out
to
brookline
milton
rogers
is
a
rascal
if
you
want
to
know
or
else
all
the
signs
fail
but
i
guess
he
find
he
got
his
lapham
shut
his
lips
so
that
the
short
beard
stuck
straight
out
on
them
what
he
done
what
he
done
well
now
i
tell
you
what
he
done
persis
since
you
think
rogers
is
such
a
saint
and
that
i
used
him
so
badly
in
getting
him
out
of
the
business
he
been
dabbling
in
every
sort
of
fool
thing
you
can
lay
your
tongue
to
stocks
land
speculations
oil
claims
till
he
run
through
about
everything
but
he
did
have
a
big
milling
property
out
on
the
line
of
the
y
and
and
lands
and
for
the
last
eight
years
he
been
doing
a
business
with
business
that
would
have
made
anybody
else
rich
but
you
ca
make
milton
rogers
rich
any
more
than
you
can
fat
a
colt
it
ai
in
him
run
through
vanderbilt
jay
gould
and
tom
scott
rolled
into
one
in
less
than
six
months
give
him
a
chance
and
come
out
and
want
to
borrow
money
of
you
well
he
wo
borrow
any
more
money
of
me
and
if
he
thinks
i
do
know
as
much
about
that
milling
property
as
he
does
he
mistaken
i
taken
his
mills
but
i
guess
i
got
the
inside
track
bill
kept
me
posted
and
now
i
going
out
there
to
see
how
i
can
unload
and
i
sha
mind
a
great
deal
if
rogers
is
under
the
load
when
it
off
once
i
do
understand
you
silas
why
it
just
this
the
great
lacustrine
polar
railroad
has
leased
the
y
for
years
bought
it
practically
and
it
going
to
build
right
by
those
mills
and
it
may
want
them
and
milton
rogers
knew
it
when
he
turned
in
on
me
well
if
the
road
wants
them
do
that
make
the
mills
valuable
you
can
get
what
you
ask
for
them
can
i
the
y
is
the
only
road
that
runs
within
fifty
miles
of
the
mills
and
you
ca
get
a
foot
of
lumber
nor
a
pound
of
flour
to
market
any
other
way
as
long
as
he
had
a
little
local
road
like
the
y
to
deal
with
rogers
could
manage
but
when
it
come
to
a
big
through
line
like
the
he
could
stand
any
chance
at
all
if
such
a
road
as
that
took
a
fancy
to
his
mills
do
you
think
it
would
pay
what
he
asked
no
sir
he
would
take
what
the
road
offered
or
else
the
road
would
tell
him
to
carry
his
flour
and
lumber
to
market
himself
and
do
you
suppose
he
knew
the
wanted
the
mills
when
he
turned
them
in
on
you
asked
lapham
aghast
and
falling
helplessly
into
his
alphabetical
parlance
the
colonel
laughed
scoffingly
well
when
milton
rogers
know
which
side
his
bread
buttered
on
i
do
understand
he
added
thoughtfully
how
he
always
letting
it
fall
on
the
buttered
side
but
such
a
man
as
that
is
sure
to
have
a
screw
loose
in
him
somewhere
lapham
sat
discomfited
all
that
she
could
say
was
well
i
want
you
should
ask
yourself
whether
rogers
would
ever
have
gone
wrong
or
got
into
these
ways
of
his
if
it
had
been
for
your
forcing
him
out
of
the
business
when
you
did
i
want
you
should
think
whether
not
responsible
for
everything
he
done
since
you
go
and
get
that
bag
of
mine
ready
said
lapham
sullenly
i
guess
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
milton
rogers
too
he
added
that
evening
corey
spent
the
time
after
dinner
in
his
own
room
with
restless
excursions
to
the
library
where
his
mother
sat
with
his
father
and
sisters
and
showed
no
signs
of
leaving
them
at
last
in
coming
down
he
encountered
her
on
the
stairs
going
up
they
both
stopped
consciously
i
would
like
to
speak
with
you
mother
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
you
alone
come
to
my
room
she
said
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
know
what
i
want
to
say
he
began
there
she
looked
up
at
him
where
he
stood
by
the
and
tried
to
put
a
cheerful
note
into
her
questioning
yes
yes
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
wo
like
it
that
you
approve
of
it
i
wish
you
did
i
wish
you
could
i
used
to
liking
and
approving
everything
you
do
tom
if
i
like
this
at
once
i
shall
try
to
like
it
you
know
that
for
your
sake
whatever
it
is
i
better
be
short
he
said
with
a
quick
sigh
it
about
miss
lapham
he
hastened
to
add
i
hope
it
is
surprising
to
you
have
told
you
before
if
i
could
no
it
is
surprising
i
was
afraid
i
suspected
something
of
the
kind
they
were
both
silent
in
a
painful
silence
well
mother
he
asked
at
last
if
it
something
you
quite
made
up
mind
to
it
is
and
if
you
already
spoken
to
her
i
had
to
do
that
first
of
course
there
would
be
no
use
of
my
saying
anything
even
if
i
disliked
it
you
do
dislike
it
no
no
i
ca
say
that
of
course
i
should
have
preferred
it
if
you
had
chosen
some
nice
girl
among
those
that
you
had
been
brought
up
with
some
friend
or
associate
of
your
sisters
whose
people
we
had
known
yes
i
understand
that
and
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
been
indifferent
to
your
feelings
i
have
tried
to
consider
them
from
the
first
and
it
kept
me
hesitating
in
a
way
that
i
ashamed
to
think
of
for
it
was
quite
right
towards
others
but
your
feelings
and
my
sisters
have
been
in
my
mind
and
if
i
could
yield
to
what
i
supposed
they
must
be
entirely
even
so
good
a
son
and
brother
as
this
when
it
came
to
his
love
affair
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
yielded
much
in
considering
the
feelings
of
his
family
at
all
his
mother
hastened
to
comfort
him
i
know
i
know
i
seen
for
some
time
that
this
might
happen
tom
and
i
have
prepared
myself
for
it
i
have
talked
it
over
with
your
father
and
we
both
agreed
from
the
beginning
that
you
were
not
to
be
hampered
by
our
feeling
still
it
is
a
surprise
it
must
be
i
know
it
i
can
understand
your
feeling
but
i
sure
that
it
one
that
will
last
only
while
you
do
know
her
well
oh
i
sure
of
that
tom
i
sure
that
we
shall
all
be
fond
of
her
for
your
sake
at
first
even
and
i
hope
she
like
us
i
am
quite
certain
of
that
said
corey
with
that
confidence
which
experience
does
not
always
confirm
in
such
cases
and
your
taking
it
as
you
do
lifts
a
tremendous
load
off
me
but
he
sighed
so
heavily
and
looked
so
troubled
that
his
mother
said
well
now
you
must
think
of
that
any
more
we
wish
what
is
for
your
happiness
my
son
and
we
will
gladly
reconcile
ourselves
to
anything
that
might
have
been
disagreeable
i
suppose
we
need
speak
of
the
family
we
must
both
think
alike
about
them
they
have
their
drawbacks
but
they
are
thoroughly
good
people
and
i
satisfied
myself
the
other
night
that
they
were
not
to
be
dreaded
she
rose
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
i
wish
you
joy
tom
if
she
half
as
good
as
you
are
you
will
both
be
very
happy
she
was
going
to
kiss
him
but
something
in
his
looks
stopped
her
an
absence
a
trouble
which
broke
out
in
his
words
i
must
tell
you
mother
there
been
a
complication
a
mistake
that
a
blight
on
me
yet
and
that
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
we
could
escape
from
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
us
they
all
thought
i
meant
the
other
sister
o
tom
but
how
could
they
i
do
know
it
seemed
so
glaringly
plain
i
was
ashamed
of
making
it
so
outright
from
the
beginning
but
they
did
even
she
did
herself
but
where
could
they
have
thought
your
eyes
were
your
taste
it
would
be
surprising
if
any
one
were
taken
with
that
wonderful
beauty
and
i
sure
she
good
too
but
i
astonished
at
them
to
think
you
could
prefer
that
little
black
odd
creature
with
her
joking
and
mother
cried
the
young
man
turning
a
ghastly
face
of
warning
upon
her
what
do
you
mean
tom
did
you
did
did
you
think
so
too
that
it
was
irene
i
meant
why
of
course
he
stared
at
her
hopelessly
o
my
son
she
said
for
all
comment
on
the
situation
do
reproach
me
mother
i
could
stand
it
no
i
did
mean
to
do
that
but
how
how
could
it
happen
i
do
know
when
she
first
told
me
that
they
had
understood
it
so
i
laughed
almost
it
was
so
far
from
me
but
now
when
you
seem
to
have
had
the
same
idea
did
you
all
think
so
yes
they
remained
looking
at
each
other
then
corey
began
it
did
pass
through
my
mind
once
that
day
i
went
to
call
upon
them
that
it
might
not
be
as
we
thought
but
i
knew
so
little
of
of
penelope
corey
mechanically
supplied
is
that
her
name
i
forgot
that
i
only
thought
of
you
in
relation
to
her
long
enough
to
reject
the
idea
and
it
was
natural
after
our
seeing
something
of
the
other
one
last
year
that
i
might
suppose
you
had
formed
some
attachment
yes
that
what
they
thought
too
but
i
never
thought
of
her
as
anything
but
a
pretty
child
i
was
civil
to
her
because
you
wished
it
and
when
i
met
her
here
again
i
only
tried
to
see
her
so
that
i
could
talk
with
her
about
her
sister
you
need
defend
yourself
to
me
tom
said
his
mother
proud
to
say
it
to
him
in
his
trouble
it
a
terrible
business
for
them
poor
things
she
added
i
do
know
how
they
could
get
over
it
but
of
course
sensible
people
must
see
they
have
got
over
it
at
least
she
has
since
it
happened
there
been
nothing
that
has
made
me
prouder
and
fonder
of
her
at
first
i
was
charmed
with
her
my
fancy
was
taken
she
delighted
me
i
do
know
how
but
she
was
simply
the
most
fascinating
person
i
ever
saw
now
i
never
think
of
that
i
only
think
how
good
she
is
how
patient
she
is
with
me
and
how
unsparing
she
is
of
herself
if
she
were
concerned
alone
if
i
were
not
concerned
too
it
would
soon
end
she
never
had
a
thought
for
anything
but
her
sister
feeling
and
mine
from
the
beginning
i
go
there
i
know
that
i
ought
but
i
ca
help
it
and
she
suffers
it
and
tries
not
to
let
me
see
that
she
is
suffering
it
there
never
was
any
one
like
her
so
brave
so
true
so
noble
i
wo
give
her
up
i
ca
but
it
breaks
my
heart
when
she
accuses
herself
of
what
was
all
my
doing
we
spend
our
time
trying
to
reason
out
of
it
but
we
always
come
back
to
it
at
last
and
i
have
to
hear
her
morbidly
blaming
herself
oh
doubtless
corey
imagined
some
reliefs
to
this
suffering
some
qualifications
of
this
sublimity
in
a
girl
she
had
disliked
so
distinctly
but
she
saw
none
in
her
son
behaviour
and
she
gave
him
her
further
sympathy
she
tried
to
praise
penelope
and
said
that
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
she
could
reconcile
herself
at
once
to
everything
i
should
have
liked
it
in
her
if
she
had
but
time
will
bring
it
all
right
and
if
she
really
cares
for
you
i
extorted
that
from
her
well
then
you
must
look
at
it
in
the
best
light
you
can
there
is
no
blame
anywhere
and
the
mortification
and
pain
is
something
that
must
be
lived
down
that
all
and
do
let
what
i
said
grieve
you
tom
you
know
i
scarcely
knew
her
and
i
i
shall
be
sure
to
like
any
one
you
like
after
all
yes
i
know
said
the
young
man
drearily
will
you
tell
father
if
you
wish
he
must
know
and
i
could
stand
any
more
of
this
just
yet
any
more
mistake
i
will
tell
him
said
corey
and
it
was
naturally
the
next
thing
for
a
woman
who
dwelt
so
much
on
decencies
to
propose
we
must
go
to
call
on
her
your
sisters
and
i
they
have
never
seen
her
even
and
she
must
be
allowed
to
think
we
indifferent
to
her
especially
under
the
circumstances
oh
no
do
go
not
yet
cried
corey
with
an
instinctive
perception
that
nothing
could
be
worse
for
him
we
must
wait
we
must
be
patient
i
afraid
it
would
be
painful
to
her
now
he
turned
away
without
speaking
further
and
his
mother
eyes
followed
him
wistfully
to
the
door
there
were
some
questions
that
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
him
but
she
had
to
content
herself
with
trying
to
answer
them
when
her
husband
put
them
to
her
there
was
this
comfort
for
her
always
in
bromfield
corey
that
he
never
was
much
surprised
at
anything
however
shocking
or
painful
his
standpoint
in
regard
to
most
matters
was
that
of
the
sympathetic
humorist
who
would
be
glad
to
have
the
victim
of
circumstance
laugh
with
him
but
was
not
too
much
vexed
when
the
victim
could
not
he
laughed
now
when
his
wife
with
careful
preparation
got
the
facts
of
his
son
predicament
fully
under
his
eye
really
bromfield
she
said
i
do
see
how
you
can
laugh
do
you
see
any
way
out
of
it
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
has
been
found
already
tom
has
told
his
love
to
the
right
one
and
the
wrong
one
knows
it
time
will
do
the
rest
if
i
had
so
low
an
opinion
of
them
all
as
that
it
would
make
me
very
unhappy
it
shocking
to
think
of
it
it
is
upon
the
theory
of
ladies
and
all
young
people
said
her
husband
with
a
shrug
feeling
his
way
to
the
matches
on
the
mantel
and
then
dropping
them
with
a
sign
as
if
recollecting
that
he
must
not
smoke
there
i
no
doubt
tom
feels
himself
an
awful
sinner
but
apparently
he
resigned
to
his
sin
he
is
going
to
give
her
up
i
glad
to
say
for
the
sake
of
human
nature
that
she
resigned
little
as
i
like
her
cried
corey
her
husband
shrugged
again
oh
there
must
be
any
indecent
haste
she
will
instinctively
observe
the
proprieties
but
come
now
anna
you
must
pretend
to
me
here
in
the
sanctuary
of
home
that
practically
the
human
affections
do
reconcile
themselves
to
any
situation
that
the
human
sentiments
condemn
suppose
the
wrong
sister
had
died
would
the
right
one
have
had
any
scruple
in
marrying
tom
after
they
had
both
a
proper
time
as
the
phrase
is
bromfield
you
shocking
not
more
shocking
than
reality
you
may
regard
this
as
a
second
marriage
he
looked
at
her
with
twinkling
eyes
full
of
the
triumph
the
spectator
of
his
species
feels
in
signal
exhibitions
of
human
nature
depend
upon
it
the
right
sister
will
be
reconciled
the
wrong
one
will
be
consoled
and
all
will
go
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
a
second
marriage
bell
why
it
quite
like
a
romance
here
he
laughed
outright
again
well
sighed
the
wife
i
could
almost
wish
the
right
one
as
you
call
her
would
reject
tom
i
dislike
her
so
much
ah
now
you
talking
business
anna
said
her
husband
with
his
hands
spread
behind
the
back
he
turned
comfortably
to
the
fire
the
whole
lapham
tribe
is
distasteful
to
me
as
i
do
happen
to
have
seen
our
elect
i
have
still
the
hope
which
disposed
to
forbid
me
that
she
may
not
be
quite
so
unacceptable
as
the
others
do
you
really
feel
so
bromfield
anxiously
inquired
his
wife
yes
i
think
i
do
and
he
sat
down
and
stretched
out
his
long
legs
toward
the
fire
but
it
very
inconsistent
of
you
to
oppose
the
matter
now
when
you
shown
so
much
indifference
up
to
this
time
you
told
me
all
along
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
oppose
it
so
i
have
i
was
convinced
of
that
at
the
beginning
or
my
reason
was
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
equal
to
any
trial
any
sacrifice
day
after
but
when
it
comes
it
another
thing
as
long
as
this
crisis
decently
kept
its
distance
i
could
look
at
it
with
an
impartial
eye
but
now
that
it
seems
at
hand
i
find
that
while
my
reason
is
still
acquiescent
my
nerves
are
disposed
to
excuse
the
phrase
kick
i
ask
myself
what
have
i
done
nothing
for
all
my
life
and
lived
as
a
gentleman
should
upon
the
earnings
of
somebody
else
in
the
possession
of
every
polite
taste
and
feeling
that
adorns
leisure
if
i
to
come
to
this
at
last
and
i
find
no
satisfactory
answer
i
say
to
myself
that
i
might
as
well
have
yielded
to
the
pressure
all
round
me
and
gone
to
work
as
tom
has
corey
looked
at
him
forlornly
divining
the
core
of
real
repugnance
that
existed
in
his
i
assure
you
my
dear
he
continued
that
the
recollection
of
what
i
suffered
from
the
laphams
at
that
dinner
of
yours
is
an
anguish
still
it
was
their
behaviour
they
behaved
well
enough
or
ill
enough
but
their
conversation
was
terrible
lapham
range
was
strictly
domestic
and
when
the
colonel
got
me
in
the
library
he
poured
mineral
paint
all
over
me
till
i
could
have
been
safely
warranted
not
to
crack
or
scale
in
any
climate
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
see
a
good
deal
of
them
they
will
probably
come
here
every
sunday
night
to
tea
it
a
perspective
without
a
it
may
not
be
so
bad
after
all
said
his
wife
and
she
suggested
for
his
consolation
that
he
knew
very
little
about
the
laphams
yet
he
assented
to
the
fact
i
know
very
little
about
them
and
about
my
other
i
dare
say
that
i
should
like
the
laphams
better
if
i
knew
them
better
but
in
any
case
i
resign
myself
and
we
must
keep
in
view
the
fact
that
this
is
mainly
tom
affair
and
if
his
affections
have
regulated
it
to
his
satisfaction
we
must
be
content
oh
yes
sighed
corey
and
perhaps
it
wo
turn
out
so
badly
it
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
you
feel
just
as
i
do
about
it
i
do
said
her
husband
and
more
too
it
was
she
and
her
daughters
who
would
be
chiefly
annoyed
by
the
lapham
connection
she
knew
that
but
she
had
to
begin
to
bear
the
burden
by
helping
her
husband
to
bear
his
light
share
of
it
to
see
him
so
depressed
dismayed
her
and
she
might
well
have
reproached
him
more
sharply
than
she
did
for
showing
so
much
indifference
when
she
was
so
anxious
at
first
but
that
would
not
have
served
any
good
end
now
she
even
answered
him
patiently
when
he
asked
her
what
did
you
say
to
tom
when
he
told
you
it
was
the
other
one
what
could
i
say
i
could
do
nothing
but
try
to
take
back
what
i
had
said
against
her
yes
you
had
quite
enough
to
do
i
suppose
it
an
awkward
business
if
it
had
been
the
pretty
one
her
beauty
would
have
been
our
excuse
but
the
plain
one
what
do
you
suppose
attracted
him
in
her
corey
sighed
at
the
futility
of
the
question
perhaps
i
did
her
injustice
i
only
saw
her
a
few
moments
perhaps
i
got
a
false
impression
i
do
think
she
lacking
in
sense
and
that
a
great
thing
she
be
quick
to
see
that
we
do
mean
unkindness
and
ca
by
anything
we
say
or
do
when
she
tom
wife
she
pronounced
the
distasteful
word
with
courage
and
went
on
the
pretty
one
might
not
have
been
able
to
see
that
she
might
have
got
it
into
her
head
that
we
were
looking
down
on
her
and
those
insipid
people
are
terribly
stubborn
we
can
come
to
some
understanding
with
this
one
i
sure
of
that
she
ended
by
declaring
that
it
was
now
their
duty
to
help
tom
out
of
his
terrible
predicament
oh
even
the
lapham
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
said
corey
in
fact
it
seems
really
to
have
all
turned
out
for
the
best
anna
though
rather
curious
to
find
you
the
champion
of
the
lapham
side
at
last
confess
now
that
the
right
girl
has
secretly
been
your
choice
all
along
and
that
while
you
sympathise
with
the
wrong
one
you
rejoice
in
the
tenacity
with
which
the
right
one
is
clinging
to
her
own
he
added
with
final
seriousness
it
just
that
she
should
and
so
far
as
i
understand
the
case
i
respect
her
for
it
oh
yes
sighed
corey
it
natural
and
it
right
but
she
added
i
suppose
they
glad
of
him
on
any
terms
that
is
what
i
have
been
taught
to
believe
said
her
husband
when
shall
we
see
our
elect
i
find
myself
rather
impatient
to
have
that
part
of
it
over
corey
hesitated
tom
thinks
we
had
better
not
call
just
yet
she
has
told
him
of
your
terrible
behaviour
when
you
called
before
no
bromfield
she
could
be
so
vulgar
as
that
but
anything
short
of
it
xxi
lapham
was
gone
a
fortnight
he
was
in
a
sullen
humour
when
he
came
back
and
kept
himself
shut
close
within
his
own
den
at
the
office
the
first
day
he
entered
it
in
the
morning
without
a
word
to
his
clerks
as
he
passed
through
the
outer
room
and
he
made
no
sign
throughout
the
forenoon
except
to
strike
savagely
on
his
from
time
to
time
and
send
out
to
walker
for
some
book
of
accounts
or
a
his
boy
confidentially
reported
to
walker
that
the
old
man
seemed
to
have
got
a
lot
of
papers
round
and
at
lunch
the
said
to
corey
at
the
little
table
which
they
had
taken
in
a
corner
together
in
default
of
seats
at
the
counter
well
sir
i
guess
there
a
cold
wave
coming
corey
looked
up
innocently
and
said
i
have
read
the
weather
report
yes
sir
walker
continued
it
coming
areas
of
rain
along
the
whole
coast
and
increased
pressure
in
the
region
of
the
private
office
up
at
the
old
man
door
now
corey
perceived
that
he
was
speaking
figuratively
and
that
his
meteorology
was
entirely
personal
to
lapham
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
without
vivid
interest
in
the
allegory
his
mind
being
full
of
his
own
why
just
this
i
guess
the
old
man
takin
in
sail
and
i
guess
he
got
to
as
i
told
you
the
first
time
we
talked
about
him
there
do
any
one
know
as
much
about
the
old
man
business
as
the
old
man
does
himself
and
i
ai
betraying
any
confidence
when
i
say
that
i
guess
that
old
partner
of
his
has
got
pretty
deep
into
his
books
i
guess
he
over
head
and
ears
in
and
the
old
man
gone
in
after
him
and
he
got
a
drownin
man
grip
round
his
neck
there
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
a
lull
kind
of
a
dead
calm
i
call
it
in
the
paint
market
just
now
and
then
again
a
man
do
build
a
house
without
feeling
the
drain
unless
there
a
regular
boom
and
just
now
there
ai
any
boom
at
all
oh
i
do
say
but
what
the
old
man
got
anchors
to
windward
guess
he
has
but
if
he
goin
to
leave
me
his
money
i
wish
he
left
it
six
weeks
ago
yes
sir
i
guess
there
a
cold
wave
comin
but
you
ca
generally
always
tell
as
a
usual
thing
where
the
old
man
concerned
and
it
only
a
guess
walker
began
to
feed
in
his
breaded
chop
with
the
same
nervous
excitement
with
which
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
slangy
and
figurative
excesses
of
his
talks
corey
had
listened
with
a
miserable
curiosity
and
compassion
up
to
a
certain
moment
when
a
broad
light
of
hope
flashed
upon
him
it
came
from
lapham
potential
ruin
and
the
way
out
of
the
labyrinth
that
had
hitherto
seemed
so
hopeless
was
clear
enough
if
another
disaster
would
befriend
him
and
give
him
the
opportunity
to
prove
the
unselfishness
of
his
constancy
he
thought
of
the
sum
of
money
that
was
his
own
and
that
he
might
offer
to
lend
or
practically
give
if
the
time
came
and
with
his
crude
hopes
and
purposes
formlessly
exulting
in
his
heart
he
kept
on
listening
with
an
unchanged
countenance
walker
could
not
rest
till
he
had
developed
the
whole
situation
so
far
as
he
knew
it
look
at
the
stock
we
got
on
hand
there
going
to
be
an
awful
shrinkage
on
that
now
and
when
everybody
is
shutting
down
or
running
the
works
up
at
lapham
are
going
full
chip
just
the
same
as
ever
well
it
his
pride
i
do
say
but
what
it
a
good
sort
of
pride
but
he
likes
to
make
his
brags
that
the
fire
never
been
out
in
the
works
since
they
started
and
that
no
man
work
or
wages
has
ever
been
cut
down
yet
at
lapham
it
matter
what
the
times
are
of
course
explained
walker
i
talk
so
to
everybody
do
know
as
i
should
talk
so
to
anybody
but
you
mr
corey
of
course
assented
corey
little
off
your
feed
said
walker
glancing
at
corey
plate
i
got
up
with
a
headache
well
sir
if
you
like
me
you
carry
it
round
all
day
then
i
do
know
a
much
meaner
thing
than
a
headache
unless
it
earache
or
toothache
or
some
other
kind
of
ache
i
pretty
hard
to
suit
when
it
comes
to
diseases
notice
how
yellow
the
old
man
looked
when
he
came
in
this
morning
i
do
like
to
see
a
man
of
his
build
look
yellow
much
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
face
of
rogers
now
familiar
to
lapham
clerks
showed
itself
among
them
has
colonel
lapham
returned
yet
he
asked
in
his
dry
wooden
tones
of
lapham
boy
yes
he
in
his
office
said
the
boy
and
as
rogers
advanced
he
rose
and
added
i
do
know
as
you
can
see
him
his
orders
are
not
to
let
anybody
in
oh
indeed
said
rogers
i
think
he
will
see
me
and
he
pressed
forward
well
i
have
to
ask
returned
the
boy
and
hastily
preceding
rogers
he
put
his
head
in
at
lapham
door
and
then
withdrew
it
please
to
sit
down
he
said
he
see
you
pretty
soon
and
with
an
air
of
some
surprise
rogers
obeyed
his
sere
whiskers
and
the
moustache
closing
over
both
lips
were
incongruously
and
illogically
clerical
in
effect
and
the
effect
was
heightened
for
no
reason
by
the
parchment
texture
of
his
skin
the
baldness
extending
to
the
crown
of
his
head
was
like
a
baldness
made
up
for
the
stage
what
his
face
expressed
chiefly
was
a
bland
and
beneficent
caution
here
you
must
have
said
to
yourself
is
a
man
of
just
sober
and
prudent
views
fixed
purposes
and
the
good
citizenship
that
avoids
debt
and
hazard
of
every
kind
what
do
you
want
asked
lapham
wheeling
round
in
his
as
rogers
entered
his
room
and
pushing
the
door
shut
with
his
foot
without
rising
rogers
took
the
chair
that
was
not
offered
him
and
sat
with
his
on
his
knees
and
its
crown
pointed
towards
lapham
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
he
answered
with
sufficient
i
tell
you
first
what
i
done
said
lapham
i
been
to
dubuque
and
i
found
out
all
about
that
milling
property
you
turned
in
on
me
did
you
know
that
the
had
leased
the
y
i
some
suspected
that
it
might
did
you
know
it
when
you
turned
the
property
in
on
me
did
you
know
that
the
wanted
to
buy
the
mills
i
presumed
the
road
would
give
a
fair
price
for
them
said
rogers
winking
his
eyes
in
outward
expression
of
inwardly
blinking
the
point
you
lie
said
lapham
as
quietly
as
if
correcting
him
in
a
slight
error
and
rogers
took
the
word
with
equal
sang
froid
you
knew
the
road
would
give
a
fair
price
for
the
mills
you
knew
it
would
give
what
it
chose
and
that
i
could
help
myself
when
you
let
me
take
them
you
a
thief
milton
rogers
and
you
stole
money
i
lent
you
rogers
sat
listening
as
if
respectfully
considering
the
statements
you
knew
how
i
felt
about
that
old
matter
or
my
wife
did
and
that
i
wanted
to
make
it
up
to
you
if
you
felt
anyway
badly
used
and
you
took
advantage
of
it
you
got
money
out
of
me
in
the
first
place
on
securities
that
worth
cents
on
the
dollar
and
you
let
me
in
for
this
thing
and
that
thing
and
you
bled
me
every
time
and
all
i
got
to
show
for
it
is
a
milling
property
on
a
line
of
road
that
can
squeeze
me
whenever
it
wants
to
as
dry
as
it
pleases
and
you
want
to
know
what
i
going
to
do
i
going
to
squeeze
you
i
going
to
sell
these
collaterals
of
yours
he
touched
a
bundle
of
papers
among
others
that
littered
his
desk
and
i
going
to
let
the
mills
go
for
what
they
fetch
i
ai
going
to
fight
the
lapham
wheeled
about
in
his
chair
and
turned
his
burly
back
on
his
visitor
who
sat
wholly
unmoved
there
are
some
parties
he
began
with
a
dry
tranquillity
ignoring
lapham
words
as
if
they
had
been
an
outburst
against
some
third
person
who
probably
merited
them
but
in
whom
he
was
so
little
interested
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
use
patience
in
listening
to
his
condemnation
there
are
some
english
parties
who
have
been
making
inquiries
in
regard
to
those
mills
i
guess
you
lying
rogers
said
lapham
without
looking
round
well
all
that
i
have
to
ask
is
that
you
will
not
act
hastily
i
see
you
do
think
i
in
earnest
cried
lapham
facing
fiercely
about
you
think
i
fooling
do
you
he
struck
his
bell
and
william
he
ordered
the
boy
who
answered
it
and
who
stood
waiting
while
he
dashed
off
a
note
to
the
brokers
and
enclosed
it
with
the
bundle
of
securities
in
a
large
envelope
take
these
down
to
gallop
paddock
in
state
street
right
away
now
go
he
said
to
rogers
when
the
boy
had
closed
the
door
after
him
and
he
turned
once
more
to
his
desk
rogers
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
was
not
merely
dispassionate
in
his
attitude
and
expression
he
was
impartial
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
ready
to
return
to
business
whenever
the
wayward
mood
of
his
interlocutor
permitted
then
i
understand
he
said
that
you
will
take
no
action
in
regard
to
the
mills
till
i
have
seen
the
parties
i
speak
of
lapham
faced
about
once
more
and
sat
looking
up
into
the
visage
of
rogers
in
silence
i
wonder
what
you
up
to
he
said
at
last
i
should
like
to
know
but
as
rogers
made
no
sign
of
gratifying
his
curiosity
and
treated
this
last
remark
of
lapham
as
of
the
irrelevance
of
all
the
rest
he
said
frowning
you
bring
me
a
party
that
will
give
me
enough
for
those
mills
to
clear
me
of
you
and
talk
to
you
but
do
you
come
here
with
any
man
of
straw
and
give
you
just
hours
to
prove
yourself
a
swindler
again
once
more
lapham
turned
his
back
and
rogers
after
looking
thoughtfully
into
his
hat
a
moment
cleared
his
throat
and
quietly
withdrew
maintaining
to
the
last
his
unprejudiced
demeanour
lapham
was
not
again
heard
from
as
walker
phrased
it
during
the
afternoon
except
when
the
last
mail
was
taken
in
to
him
then
the
sound
of
rending
envelopes
mixed
with
that
of
what
seemed
suppressed
swearing
penetrated
to
the
outer
office
somewhat
earlier
than
the
usual
hour
for
closing
he
appeared
there
with
his
hat
on
and
his
overcoat
buttoned
about
him
he
said
briefly
to
his
boy
william
i
sha
be
back
again
this
afternoon
and
then
went
to
miss
dewey
and
left
a
number
of
letters
on
her
table
to
be
copied
and
went
out
nothing
had
been
said
but
a
sense
of
trouble
subtly
diffused
itself
through
those
who
saw
him
go
out
that
evening
as
he
sat
down
with
his
wife
alone
at
tea
he
asked
ai
pen
coming
to
supper
no
she
ai
said
his
wife
i
do
know
as
i
like
the
way
going
on
any
too
well
i
afraid
if
she
keeps
on
she
be
down
sick
she
got
deeper
feelings
than
irene
lapham
said
nothing
but
having
helped
himself
to
the
abundance
of
his
table
in
his
usual
fashion
he
sat
and
looked
at
his
plate
with
an
indifference
that
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
his
wife
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
nothing
i
have
got
any
appetite
what
the
matter
she
persisted
trouble
the
matter
bad
luck
and
lots
of
it
the
matter
said
lapham
i
have
ever
hid
anything
from
you
persis
well
you
asked
me
and
it
too
late
to
begin
now
i
in
a
fix
i
tell
you
what
kind
of
a
fix
if
you
think
it
do
you
any
good
but
i
guess
be
satisfied
to
know
that
it
a
fix
how
much
of
a
one
she
asked
with
a
look
of
grave
steady
courage
in
her
eyes
well
i
do
know
as
i
can
tell
just
yet
said
lapham
avoiding
this
look
things
have
been
dull
all
the
fall
but
i
thought
brisk
up
come
winter
they
have
there
have
been
a
lot
of
failures
and
some
of
owed
me
and
some
of
had
me
on
their
paper
and
lapham
stopped
and
what
prompted
his
wife
he
hesitated
before
he
added
and
then
rogers
i
to
blame
for
that
said
lapham
i
forced
you
to
it
no
i
was
as
willing
to
go
into
it
as
what
you
were
answered
lapham
i
do
want
to
blame
anybody
lapham
had
a
woman
passion
for
fixing
responsibility
she
could
not
help
saying
as
soon
as
acquitted
i
warned
you
against
him
silas
i
told
you
not
to
let
him
get
in
any
deeper
with
you
oh
yes
i
had
to
help
him
to
try
to
get
my
money
back
i
might
as
well
poured
water
into
a
sieve
and
now
lapham
stopped
do
be
afraid
to
speak
out
to
me
silas
lapham
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
i
want
to
know
it
i
got
to
know
it
what
did
i
ever
care
for
the
money
i
had
a
happy
home
with
you
ever
since
we
were
married
and
i
guess
i
shall
have
as
long
as
you
live
whether
we
go
on
to
the
back
bay
or
go
back
to
the
old
house
at
lapham
i
know
to
blame
and
i
blame
myself
it
was
my
forcing
rogers
on
to
you
she
came
back
to
this
with
her
helpless
longing
inbred
in
all
puritan
souls
to
have
some
one
specifically
suffer
for
the
evil
in
the
world
even
if
it
must
be
herself
it
has
come
to
the
worst
yet
persis
said
her
husband
but
i
shall
have
to
hold
up
on
the
new
house
a
little
while
till
i
can
see
where
i
am
i
should
care
if
we
had
to
sell
it
cried
his
wife
in
passionate
i
should
be
glad
if
we
had
to
as
far
as
concerned
i
should
said
lapham
i
know
said
his
wife
and
she
remembered
ruefully
how
his
heart
was
set
on
it
he
sat
musing
well
i
guess
it
going
to
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
or
if
it
ai
he
sighed
we
ca
help
it
may
be
pen
need
worry
so
much
about
corey
after
all
he
continued
with
a
bitter
irony
new
to
him
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
there
a
chance
he
ended
with
a
still
bitterer
laugh
that
rogers
will
come
to
time
after
all
i
do
believe
it
exclaimed
lapham
with
a
gleam
of
hope
in
her
eyes
what
chance
one
in
ten
million
said
lapham
and
her
face
fell
again
he
says
there
are
some
english
parties
after
him
to
buy
these
mills
well
well
i
gave
him
hours
to
prove
himself
a
liar
you
do
believe
there
are
any
such
parties
not
in
this
world
but
if
there
were
well
if
there
were
persis
but
pshaw
no
no
she
pleaded
eagerly
it
do
seem
as
if
he
could
be
such
a
villain
what
would
be
the
use
of
his
pretending
if
he
brought
the
parties
to
you
well
said
lapham
scornfully
i
let
them
have
the
mills
at
the
price
rogers
turned
in
on
me
at
i
do
want
to
make
anything
on
but
guess
i
shall
hear
from
the
first
and
when
they
make
their
offer
i
guess
i
have
to
accept
it
whatever
it
is
i
do
think
they
have
a
great
many
competitors
lapham
could
not
give
up
her
hope
if
you
could
get
your
price
from
those
english
parties
before
they
knew
that
the
wanted
to
buy
the
mills
would
it
let
you
out
with
rogers
just
about
said
lapham
then
i
know
he
move
heaven
and
earth
to
bring
it
about
i
know
you
wo
be
allowed
to
suffer
for
doing
him
a
kindness
silas
he
be
so
ungrateful
why
why
should
he
pretend
to
have
any
such
parties
in
view
when
he
has
do
you
be
si
you
see
that
he
be
round
with
them
lapham
laughed
but
she
urged
so
many
reasons
for
her
belief
in
rogers
that
lapham
began
to
rekindle
his
own
faith
a
little
he
ended
by
asking
for
a
hot
cup
of
tea
and
lapham
sent
the
pot
out
and
had
a
fresh
one
steeped
for
him
after
that
he
made
a
hearty
supper
in
the
revulsion
from
his
entire
despair
and
they
fell
asleep
that
night
talking
hopefully
of
his
affairs
which
he
laid
before
her
fully
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
first
started
in
business
that
brought
the
old
times
back
and
he
said
if
this
had
happened
then
i
should
have
cared
much
i
was
young
then
and
i
was
afraid
of
anything
but
i
noticed
that
after
i
passed
fifty
i
began
to
get
scared
easier
i
do
believe
i
could
pick
up
now
from
a
regular
pshaw
you
scared
silas
lapham
cried
his
wife
proudly
i
should
like
to
see
the
thing
that
ever
scared
you
or
the
knockdown
that
you
could
pick
up
from
is
that
so
persis
he
asked
with
the
joy
her
courage
gave
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
called
to
him
in
a
voice
which
the
darkness
rendered
still
more
deeply
troubled
are
you
awake
silas
yes
i
awake
i
been
thinking
about
those
english
parties
si
so
i
and
i
ca
make
it
out
but
what
you
be
just
as
bad
as
rogers
every
bit
and
grain
if
you
were
to
let
them
have
the
mills
and
not
tell
what
the
chances
were
with
the
i
thought
of
that
and
you
need
be
afraid
she
began
to
bewail
herself
and
to
sob
convulsively
o
silas
o
silas
heaven
knows
in
what
measure
the
passion
of
her
soul
was
mired
with
pride
in
her
husband
honesty
relief
from
an
apprehended
struggle
and
pity
for
him
hush
hush
persis
he
besought
her
you
wake
pen
if
you
keep
on
that
way
do
cry
any
more
you
must
oh
let
me
cry
silas
it
help
me
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
minute
do
you
mind
she
sobbed
herself
quiet
it
does
seem
too
hard
she
said
when
she
could
speak
again
that
you
have
to
give
up
this
chance
when
providence
had
fairly
raised
it
up
for
you
i
guess
it
providence
raised
it
up
said
lapham
any
rate
it
got
to
go
most
likely
rogers
was
lyin
and
there
ai
any
such
parties
but
if
there
were
they
could
have
the
mills
from
me
without
the
whole
story
do
you
be
troubled
persis
i
going
to
pull
through
all
right
oh
i
ai
afraid
i
do
suppose
but
what
there
plenty
would
help
you
if
they
knew
you
needed
it
si
they
would
if
they
knew
i
did
need
it
said
lapham
sardonically
did
you
tell
bill
how
you
stood
no
i
could
bear
to
i
been
the
rich
one
so
long
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
own
up
that
i
was
in
danger
yes
besides
it
did
look
so
ugly
till
but
i
guess
we
sha
let
ugly
looks
scare
us
no
xxii
the
morning
postman
brought
lapham
a
letter
from
irene
which
was
chiefly
significant
because
it
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
writer
or
her
state
of
mind
it
gave
the
news
of
her
uncle
family
it
told
of
their
kindness
to
her
her
cousin
will
was
going
to
take
her
and
his
sisters
on
the
river
when
it
froze
by
the
time
this
letter
came
lapham
had
gone
to
his
business
and
the
mother
carried
it
to
penelope
to
talk
over
what
do
you
make
out
of
it
she
asked
and
without
waiting
to
be
answered
she
said
i
know
as
i
believe
in
cousins
marrying
a
great
deal
but
if
irene
and
will
were
to
fix
it
up
between
she
looked
vaguely
at
penelope
it
would
make
any
difference
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
replied
the
girl
listlessly
lapham
lost
her
patience
well
then
i
tell
you
what
penelope
she
exclaimed
perhaps
it
make
a
difference
to
you
if
you
know
that
your
father
in
real
trouble
he
harassed
to
death
and
he
was
awake
half
the
night
talking
about
it
that
abominable
rogers
has
got
a
lot
of
money
away
from
him
and
he
lost
by
others
that
he
helped
lapham
put
it
in
this
way
because
she
had
no
time
to
be
explicit
and
i
want
you
should
come
out
of
your
room
now
and
try
to
be
of
some
help
and
comfort
to
him
when
he
comes
home
i
guess
irene
mope
round
much
if
she
was
here
she
could
not
help
adding
the
girl
lifted
herself
on
her
elbow
what
that
you
say
about
father
she
demanded
eagerly
is
he
in
trouble
is
he
going
to
lose
his
money
shall
we
have
to
stay
in
this
house
we
may
be
very
glad
to
stay
in
this
house
said
lapham
half
angry
with
herself
for
having
given
cause
for
the
girl
conjectures
and
half
with
the
habit
of
prosperity
in
her
child
which
could
conceive
no
better
of
what
adversity
was
and
i
want
you
should
get
up
and
show
that
you
got
some
feeling
for
somebody
in
the
world
besides
yourself
oh
i
get
up
said
the
girl
promptly
almost
cheerfully
i
do
say
it
as
bad
now
as
it
looked
a
little
while
ago
said
her
mother
conscientiously
hedging
a
little
from
the
statement
which
she
had
based
rather
upon
her
feelings
than
her
facts
your
father
thinks
he
pull
through
all
right
and
i
do
know
but
what
he
will
but
i
want
you
should
see
if
you
ca
do
something
to
cheer
him
up
and
keep
him
from
getting
so
perfectly
as
he
seems
to
get
under
the
load
he
got
to
carry
and
stop
thinking
about
yourself
a
while
and
behave
yourself
like
a
sensible
girl
yes
yes
said
the
girl
i
will
you
need
be
troubled
about
me
any
more
before
she
left
her
room
she
wrote
a
note
and
when
she
came
down
she
was
dressed
to
go
and
post
it
herself
the
note
was
to
corey
do
not
come
to
see
me
any
more
till
you
hear
from
me
i
have
a
reason
which
i
can
not
give
you
now
and
you
must
not
ask
what
it
is
all
day
she
went
about
in
a
buoyant
desperation
and
she
came
down
to
meet
her
father
at
supper
well
persis
he
said
scornfully
as
he
sat
down
we
might
as
well
saved
our
good
resolutions
till
they
were
wanted
i
guess
those
english
parties
have
gone
back
on
rogers
do
you
mean
he
did
come
he
had
come
up
to
five
said
lapham
tchk
uttered
his
wife
but
i
guess
i
shall
pull
through
without
rogers
continued
lapham
a
firm
that
i
did
think
could
weather
it
is
still
afloat
and
so
far
forth
as
the
danger
goes
of
being
dragged
under
with
it
i
all
right
penelope
came
in
hello
pen
cried
her
father
it
ai
often
i
meet
you
nowadays
he
put
up
his
hand
as
she
passed
his
chair
and
pulled
her
down
and
kissed
her
no
she
said
but
i
thought
i
come
down
and
cheer
you
up
a
little
i
shall
not
talk
the
sight
of
me
will
be
enough
her
father
laughed
out
mother
been
telling
you
well
i
was
pretty
blue
last
night
but
i
guess
i
was
more
scared
than
hurt
how
you
like
to
go
to
the
theatre
sellers
at
the
park
heigh
well
i
do
know
do
you
think
they
could
get
along
without
me
there
no
could
work
it
at
all
cried
the
colonel
let
all
go
unless
he
added
inquiringly
there
somebody
coming
here
there
nobody
coming
said
penelope
good
then
we
go
mother
do
you
be
late
now
oh
i
sha
keep
you
waiting
said
lapham
she
had
thought
of
telling
what
a
cheerful
letter
she
had
got
from
irene
but
upon
the
whole
it
seemed
better
not
to
speak
of
irene
at
all
just
then
after
they
returned
from
the
theatre
where
the
colonel
roared
through
the
comedy
with
continual
reference
of
his
pleasure
to
penelope
to
make
sure
that
she
was
enjoying
it
too
his
wife
said
as
if
the
whole
affair
had
been
for
the
girl
distraction
rather
than
his
i
believe
but
what
it
going
to
come
out
all
right
about
the
children
and
then
she
told
him
of
the
letter
and
the
hopes
she
had
founded
upon
it
well
perhaps
you
right
persis
he
consented
i
have
seen
pen
so
much
like
herself
since
it
happened
i
declare
when
i
see
the
way
she
came
out
just
to
please
you
i
know
as
i
want
you
should
get
over
all
your
troubles
right
away
i
guess
there
be
enough
to
keep
pen
going
for
a
while
yet
said
the
colonel
winding
up
his
watch
but
for
a
time
there
was
a
relief
which
walker
noted
in
the
atmosphere
at
the
office
and
then
came
another
cold
wave
slighter
than
the
first
but
distinctly
felt
there
and
succeeded
by
another
relief
it
was
like
the
winter
which
was
wearing
on
to
the
end
of
the
year
with
alternations
of
freezing
weather
and
mild
days
stretching
to
weeks
in
which
the
snow
and
ice
wholly
disappeared
it
was
none
the
less
winter
and
none
the
less
harassing
for
these
fluctuations
and
lapham
showed
in
his
face
and
temper
the
effect
of
like
fluctuations
in
his
affairs
he
grew
thin
and
old
and
both
at
home
and
at
his
office
he
was
irascible
to
the
point
of
offence
in
these
days
penelope
shared
with
her
mother
the
burden
of
their
troubled
home
and
united
with
her
in
supporting
the
silence
or
the
petulance
of
the
gloomy
secret
man
who
replaced
the
presence
of
jolly
prosperity
there
lapham
had
now
ceased
to
talk
of
his
troubles
and
savagely
resented
his
wife
interference
you
mind
your
own
business
persis
he
said
one
day
if
you
got
any
and
after
that
she
left
him
mainly
to
penelope
who
did
not
think
of
asking
him
questions
it
pretty
hard
on
you
pen
she
said
that
makes
it
easier
for
me
returned
the
girl
who
did
not
otherwise
refer
to
her
own
trouble
in
her
heart
she
had
wondered
a
little
at
the
absolute
obedience
of
corey
who
had
made
no
sign
since
receiving
her
note
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
her
father
if
corey
was
sick
she
would
have
liked
him
to
ask
her
why
corey
did
not
come
any
more
her
mother
went
on
i
do
believe
your
father
knows
where
he
stands
he
works
away
at
those
papers
he
brings
home
here
at
night
as
if
he
did
half
know
what
he
was
about
he
always
did
have
that
close
streak
in
him
and
i
do
suppose
but
what
he
been
going
into
things
he
do
want
anybody
else
to
know
about
and
he
kept
these
accounts
of
his
own
sometimes
he
gave
penelope
figures
to
work
at
which
he
would
not
submit
to
his
wife
nimbler
arithmetic
then
she
went
to
bed
and
left
them
sitting
up
till
midnight
struggling
with
problems
in
which
they
were
both
weak
but
she
could
see
that
the
girl
was
a
comfort
to
her
father
and
that
his
troubles
were
a
defence
and
shelter
to
her
some
nights
she
could
hear
them
going
out
together
and
then
she
lay
awake
for
their
return
from
their
long
walk
when
the
hour
or
day
of
respite
came
again
the
home
felt
it
first
lapham
wanted
to
know
what
the
news
from
irene
was
he
joined
his
wife
in
all
her
cheerful
speculations
and
tried
to
make
her
amends
for
his
sullen
reticence
and
irritability
irene
was
staying
on
at
dubuque
there
came
a
letter
from
her
saying
that
her
uncle
people
wanted
her
to
spend
the
winter
there
well
let
her
said
lapham
it
be
the
best
thing
for
her
lapham
himself
had
letters
from
his
brother
at
frequent
intervals
his
brother
was
watching
the
which
as
yet
had
made
no
offer
for
the
mills
once
when
one
of
these
letters
came
he
submitted
to
his
wife
whether
in
the
absence
of
any
positive
information
that
the
road
wanted
the
property
he
might
not
with
a
good
conscience
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
to
anybody
who
came
along
she
looked
wistfully
at
him
it
was
on
the
rise
from
a
season
of
deep
depression
with
him
no
si
she
said
i
do
see
how
you
could
do
that
he
did
not
assent
and
submit
as
he
had
done
at
first
but
began
to
rail
at
the
unpracticality
of
women
and
then
he
shut
some
papers
he
had
been
looking
over
into
his
desk
and
flung
out
of
the
room
one
of
the
papers
had
slipped
through
the
crevice
of
the
lid
and
lay
upon
the
floor
lapham
kept
on
at
her
sewing
but
after
a
while
she
picked
the
paper
up
to
lay
it
on
the
desk
then
she
glanced
at
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
long
column
of
dates
and
figures
recording
successive
sums
never
large
ones
paid
regularly
to
wm
the
dates
covered
a
year
and
the
sum
amounted
at
least
to
several
hundreds
lapham
laid
the
paper
down
on
the
desk
and
then
she
took
it
up
again
and
put
it
into
her
meaning
to
give
it
to
him
when
he
came
in
she
saw
him
looking
about
for
something
and
then
going
to
work
upon
his
papers
apparently
without
it
she
thought
she
would
wait
till
he
missed
it
definitely
and
then
give
him
the
scrap
she
had
picked
up
it
lay
in
her
basket
and
after
some
days
it
found
its
way
under
the
work
in
it
and
she
forgot
it
xxiii
since
new
year
there
had
scarcely
been
a
mild
day
and
the
streets
were
full
of
snow
growing
foul
under
the
city
feet
and
hoofs
and
renewing
its
purity
from
the
skies
with
repeated
falls
which
in
turn
lost
their
whiteness
beaten
down
and
beaten
black
and
hard
into
a
solid
bed
like
iron
the
sleighing
was
incomparable
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
din
of
bells
but
lapham
turnout
was
not
of
those
that
thronged
the
brighton
road
every
afternoon
the
man
at
the
sent
him
word
that
the
mare
legs
were
swelling
he
and
corey
had
little
to
do
with
each
other
he
did
not
know
how
penelope
had
arranged
it
with
corey
his
wife
said
she
knew
no
more
than
he
did
and
he
did
not
like
to
ask
the
girl
herself
especially
as
corey
no
longer
came
to
the
house
he
saw
that
she
was
cheerfuller
than
she
had
been
and
helpfuller
with
him
and
her
mother
now
and
then
lapham
opened
his
troubled
soul
to
her
a
little
letting
his
thought
break
into
speech
without
preamble
or
conclusion
once
he
said
pen
i
presume
you
know
i
in
trouble
we
all
seem
to
be
there
said
the
girl
yes
but
there
a
difference
between
being
there
by
your
own
fault
and
being
there
by
somebody
else
i
do
call
it
his
fault
she
said
i
call
it
mine
said
the
colonel
the
girl
laughed
her
thought
was
of
her
own
care
and
her
wholly
of
his
she
must
come
to
his
ground
what
have
you
been
doing
wrong
i
do
know
as
you
call
it
wrong
it
what
people
do
all
the
time
but
i
wish
i
let
stocks
alone
it
what
i
always
promised
your
mother
i
would
do
but
there
no
use
cryin
over
spilt
milk
or
watered
stock
either
i
do
think
there
much
use
crying
about
anything
if
it
could
have
been
cried
straight
it
would
have
been
all
right
from
the
start
said
the
girl
going
back
to
her
own
affair
and
if
lapham
had
not
been
so
deeply
engrossed
in
his
he
might
have
seen
how
little
she
cared
for
all
that
money
could
do
or
undo
he
did
not
observe
her
enough
to
see
how
variable
her
moods
were
in
those
days
and
how
often
she
sank
from
some
wild
gaiety
into
abject
melancholy
how
at
times
she
was
fiercely
defiant
of
nothing
at
all
and
at
others
inexplicably
humble
and
patient
but
no
doubt
none
of
these
signs
had
passed
unnoticed
by
his
wife
to
whom
lapham
said
one
day
when
he
came
home
persis
the
reason
pen
do
marry
corey
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
silas
said
lapham
with
an
inquiring
look
at
him
for
what
lay
behind
his
words
well
i
think
it
all
tomfoolery
the
way
she
going
on
there
ai
any
rhyme
nor
reason
to
it
he
stopped
and
his
wife
waited
if
she
said
the
word
i
could
have
some
help
from
them
he
hung
his
head
and
would
not
meet
his
wife
eye
i
guess
you
in
a
pretty
bad
way
si
she
said
pityingly
or
you
would
have
come
to
that
i
in
a
hole
said
lapham
and
i
do
know
where
to
turn
you
wo
let
me
do
anything
about
those
mills
yes
i
let
you
said
his
wife
sadly
he
gave
a
miserable
cry
you
know
i
ca
do
anything
if
you
do
o
my
lord
she
had
not
seen
him
so
low
as
that
before
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
was
frightened
and
could
only
ask
has
it
come
to
the
worst
the
new
house
has
got
to
go
he
answered
evasively
she
did
not
say
anything
she
knew
that
the
work
on
the
house
had
been
stopped
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
lapham
had
told
the
architect
that
he
preferred
to
leave
it
unfinished
till
the
spring
as
there
was
no
prospect
of
their
being
able
to
get
into
it
that
winter
and
the
architect
had
agreed
with
him
that
it
would
not
hurt
it
to
stand
her
heart
was
heavy
for
him
though
she
could
not
say
so
they
sat
together
at
the
table
where
she
had
come
to
be
with
him
at
his
belated
meal
she
saw
that
he
did
not
eat
and
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
again
without
urging
him
to
take
anything
they
were
past
that
and
i
sent
orders
to
shut
down
at
the
works
he
added
shut
down
at
the
works
she
echoed
with
dismay
she
could
not
take
it
in
the
fire
at
the
works
had
never
been
out
before
since
it
was
first
kindled
she
knew
how
he
had
prided
himself
upon
that
how
he
had
bragged
of
it
to
every
listener
and
had
always
lugged
the
fact
in
as
the
last
expression
of
his
sense
of
success
o
silas
what
the
use
he
retorted
i
saw
it
was
coming
a
month
ago
there
are
some
fellows
out
in
west
virginia
that
have
been
running
the
paint
as
hard
as
they
could
they
could
do
much
they
used
to
put
it
on
the
market
raw
but
lately
they
got
to
baking
it
and
now
they
struck
a
vein
of
natural
gas
right
by
their
works
and
they
pay
ten
cents
for
fuel
where
i
pay
a
dollar
and
they
make
as
good
a
paint
anybody
can
see
where
it
going
to
end
besides
the
it
glutted
there
anything
to
do
but
to
shut
down
and
i
shut
down
i
do
know
what
going
to
become
of
the
hands
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
this
way
said
lapham
laying
hold
of
one
definite
thought
which
she
could
grasp
in
the
turmoil
of
ruin
that
whirled
before
her
eyes
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
the
hands
cried
lapham
shared
my
luck
now
let
share
the
other
thing
and
if
you
so
very
sorry
for
the
hands
i
wish
you
keep
a
little
of
your
pity
for
me
do
you
know
what
shutting
down
the
works
means
yes
indeed
i
do
silas
said
his
wife
tenderly
well
then
he
rose
leaving
his
supper
untasted
and
went
into
the
where
she
presently
found
him
with
that
everlasting
confusion
of
papers
before
him
on
the
desk
that
made
her
think
of
the
paper
in
her
and
she
decided
not
to
make
the
careworn
distracted
man
ask
her
for
it
after
all
she
brought
it
to
him
he
glanced
blankly
at
it
and
then
caught
it
from
her
turning
red
and
looking
foolish
where
you
get
that
you
dropped
it
on
the
floor
the
other
night
and
i
picked
it
up
who
is
he
repeated
looking
confusedly
at
her
and
then
at
the
paper
oh
it
nothing
he
tore
the
paper
into
small
pieces
and
went
and
dropped
them
into
the
fire
when
lapham
came
into
the
room
in
the
morning
before
he
was
down
she
found
a
scrap
of
the
paper
which
must
have
fluttered
to
the
hearth
and
glancing
at
it
she
saw
that
the
words
were
she
wondered
what
dealings
with
a
woman
her
husband
could
have
and
she
remembered
the
confusion
he
had
shown
about
the
paper
and
which
she
had
thought
was
because
she
had
surprised
one
of
his
business
secrets
she
was
still
thinking
of
it
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
tremulous
with
deep
seams
and
wrinkles
in
his
face
after
a
silence
which
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
break
silas
she
asked
who
is
he
stared
at
her
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
do
you
she
returned
mockingly
when
you
do
you
tell
me
do
you
want
any
more
coffee
no
well
then
you
can
ring
for
alice
when
you
finished
i
got
some
things
to
attend
to
she
rose
abruptly
and
left
the
room
lapham
looked
after
her
in
a
dull
way
and
then
went
on
with
his
breakfast
while
he
still
sat
at
his
coffee
she
flung
into
the
room
again
and
dashed
some
papers
down
beside
his
plate
here
are
some
more
things
of
yours
and
i
thank
you
to
lock
them
up
in
your
desk
and
not
litter
my
room
with
them
if
you
please
now
he
saw
that
she
was
angry
and
it
must
be
with
him
it
enraged
him
that
in
such
a
time
of
trouble
she
should
fly
out
at
him
in
that
way
he
left
the
house
without
trying
to
speak
to
her
that
day
corey
came
just
before
closing
and
knocking
at
lapham
door
asked
if
he
could
speak
with
him
a
few
moments
yes
said
lapham
wheeling
round
in
his
and
kicking
another
towards
corey
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
ought
to
tell
you
you
wasting
your
time
here
i
spoke
the
other
day
about
your
placin
yourself
better
and
i
can
help
you
to
do
it
yet
there
ai
going
to
be
the
for
the
paint
in
the
foreign
markets
that
we
expected
and
i
guess
you
better
give
it
up
i
do
wish
to
give
it
up
said
the
young
fellow
setting
his
lips
i
as
much
faith
in
it
as
ever
and
i
want
to
propose
now
what
i
hinted
at
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
put
some
money
into
the
business
some
money
lapham
leaned
towards
him
and
frowned
as
if
he
had
not
quite
understood
while
he
clutched
the
arms
of
his
chair
i
got
about
thirty
thousand
dollars
that
i
could
put
in
and
if
you
do
want
to
consider
me
a
partner
i
remember
that
you
objected
to
a
partner
you
can
let
me
regard
it
as
an
investment
but
i
think
i
see
the
way
to
doing
something
at
once
in
mexico
and
i
should
like
to
feel
that
i
had
something
more
than
a
drummer
interest
in
the
venture
the
men
sat
looking
into
each
other
eyes
then
lapham
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
rubbed
his
hand
hard
and
slowly
over
his
face
his
features
were
still
twisted
with
some
strong
emotion
when
he
took
it
away
your
family
know
about
this
my
uncle
james
knows
he
thinks
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
you
he
thought
that
by
this
time
i
ought
to
be
able
to
trust
my
own
judgment
do
you
suppose
i
could
see
your
uncle
at
his
office
i
imagine
he
there
well
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
him
one
of
these
days
he
sat
pondering
a
while
and
then
rose
and
went
with
corey
to
his
door
i
guess
i
sha
change
my
mind
about
taking
you
into
the
business
in
that
way
he
said
coldly
if
there
was
any
reason
why
i
should
at
first
there
more
now
very
well
sir
answered
the
young
man
and
went
to
close
his
desk
the
outer
office
was
empty
but
while
corey
was
putting
his
papers
in
order
it
was
suddenly
invaded
by
two
women
who
pushed
by
the
protesting
porter
on
the
stairs
and
made
their
way
towards
room
one
of
them
was
miss
dewey
the
girl
and
the
other
was
a
woman
whom
she
would
resemble
in
face
and
figure
twenty
years
hence
if
she
led
a
life
of
hard
work
varied
by
paroxysms
of
hard
drinking
that
his
room
asked
this
woman
pointing
towards
door
with
a
hand
that
had
not
freed
itself
from
the
fringe
of
dirty
shawl
under
which
it
had
hung
she
went
forward
without
waiting
for
the
answer
but
before
she
could
reach
it
the
door
opened
and
lapham
stood
filling
its
space
look
here
colonel
lapham
began
the
woman
in
a
high
key
of
challenge
i
want
to
know
if
this
is
the
way
you
goin
back
on
me
and
what
do
you
want
asked
lapham
what
do
i
want
what
do
you
i
want
i
want
the
money
to
pay
my
month
rent
there
ai
a
bite
to
eat
in
the
house
and
i
want
some
money
to
market
lapham
bent
a
frown
on
the
woman
under
which
she
shrank
back
a
step
you
taken
the
wrong
way
to
get
it
clear
out
i
wo
clear
out
said
the
woman
beginning
to
whimper
corey
said
lapham
in
the
peremptory
voice
of
a
master
he
had
seemed
so
indifferent
to
corey
presence
that
the
young
man
thought
he
must
have
forgotten
he
was
there
is
dennis
anywhere
round
yissor
said
dennis
answering
for
himself
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
appearing
in
the
lapham
spoke
to
the
woman
again
do
you
want
i
should
call
a
hack
or
do
you
want
i
should
call
an
officer
the
woman
began
to
cry
into
an
end
of
her
shawl
i
do
know
what
we
goin
to
do
you
going
to
clear
out
said
lapham
call
a
hack
dennis
if
you
ever
come
here
again
i
have
you
arrested
mind
that
zerrilla
i
shall
want
you
early
morning
yes
sir
said
the
girl
meekly
she
and
her
mother
shrank
out
after
the
porter
lapham
shut
his
door
without
a
word
at
lunch
the
next
day
walker
made
himself
amends
for
corey
reticence
by
talking
a
great
deal
he
talked
about
lapham
who
seemed
to
have
more
than
ever
since
his
apparent
difficulties
began
the
fascination
of
an
enigma
for
his
and
he
ended
by
asking
did
you
see
that
little
circus
last
night
what
little
circus
asked
corey
in
his
turn
those
two
women
and
the
old
man
dennis
told
me
about
it
i
told
him
if
he
liked
his
place
he
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
that
was
very
good
advice
said
corey
oh
all
right
if
you
do
want
to
talk
do
know
as
i
should
in
your
place
returned
walker
in
the
easy
security
he
had
long
felt
that
corey
had
no
intention
of
putting
on
airs
with
him
but
tell
you
what
the
old
man
ca
expect
it
of
everybody
if
he
keeps
this
thing
up
much
longer
it
going
to
be
talked
about
you
have
a
woman
walking
into
your
place
of
business
and
trying
to
bulldoze
you
before
your
porter
without
setting
your
porter
to
thinking
and
the
last
thing
you
want
a
porter
to
do
is
to
think
for
when
a
porter
thinks
he
thinks
wrong
i
do
see
why
even
a
porter
could
think
right
about
that
affair
replied
corey
i
do
know
who
the
woman
was
though
i
believe
she
was
miss
dewey
mother
but
i
could
see
that
colonel
lapham
showed
anything
but
a
natural
resentment
of
her
coming
to
him
in
that
way
i
should
have
said
she
was
some
rather
worthless
person
whom
he
been
befriending
and
that
she
had
presumed
upon
his
kindness
is
that
so
what
do
you
think
of
his
never
letting
miss
dewey
name
go
on
the
books
that
it
another
proof
it
a
sort
of
charity
of
his
that
the
only
way
to
look
at
it
oh
i
all
right
walker
lighted
a
cigar
and
began
to
smoke
with
his
eyes
closed
to
a
fine
straight
line
it
wo
do
for
a
to
think
wrong
any
more
than
a
porter
i
suppose
but
i
guess
you
and
i
do
think
very
different
about
this
thing
not
if
you
think
as
i
do
replied
corey
steadily
and
i
know
you
would
do
that
if
you
had
seen
the
yourself
a
man
treat
people
who
have
a
disgraceful
hold
upon
him
as
he
treated
them
it
depends
upon
who
he
is
said
walker
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
i
never
said
the
old
man
was
afraid
of
anything
and
character
continued
corey
disdaining
to
touch
the
matter
further
except
in
generalities
must
go
for
something
if
it
to
be
the
prey
of
mere
accident
and
appearance
then
it
goes
for
nothing
accidents
will
happen
in
the
best
regulated
families
said
walker
with
vulgar
obtuseness
that
filled
corey
with
indignation
nothing
perhaps
removed
his
nature
further
from
the
commonplace
than
a
certain
generosity
of
instinct
which
i
should
not
be
ready
to
say
was
always
infallible
that
evening
it
was
miss
dewey
turn
to
wait
for
speech
with
lapham
after
the
others
were
gone
he
opened
his
door
at
her
knock
and
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
worried
air
well
what
do
you
want
zerrilla
he
asked
with
a
sort
of
rough
kindness
i
want
to
know
what
i
going
to
do
about
hen
he
back
again
and
he
and
mother
have
made
it
up
and
they
both
got
to
drinking
last
night
after
i
went
home
and
carried
on
so
that
the
neighbours
came
in
lapham
passed
his
hand
over
his
red
and
heated
face
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
you
twice
the
trouble
that
my
own
family
is
now
but
i
know
what
i
do
mighty
quick
if
it
was
for
you
zerrilla
he
went
on
relentingly
i
shut
your
mother
up
somewheres
and
if
i
could
get
that
fellow
off
for
a
three
voyage
i
declare
said
miss
dewey
beginning
to
whimper
it
seems
as
if
he
came
back
just
so
often
to
spite
me
he
never
gone
more
than
a
year
at
the
furthest
and
you
ca
make
it
out
habitual
drunkenness
either
when
it
just
sprees
i
at
my
wit
end
oh
well
you
must
cry
around
here
said
lapham
soothingly
i
know
it
said
miss
dewey
if
i
could
get
rid
of
hen
i
could
manage
well
enough
with
mother
wemmel
would
marry
me
if
i
could
get
the
divorce
he
said
so
over
and
over
again
i
do
know
as
i
like
that
very
well
said
lapham
frowning
i
do
know
as
i
want
you
should
get
married
in
any
hurry
again
i
do
know
as
i
like
your
going
with
anybody
else
just
yet
oh
you
need
be
afraid
but
what
it
be
all
right
it
be
the
best
thing
all
round
if
i
can
marry
him
well
said
lapham
impatiently
i
ca
think
about
it
now
i
suppose
they
cleaned
everything
out
again
yes
they
have
said
zerrilla
there
is
a
cent
left
you
a
pretty
expensive
lot
said
lapham
well
here
he
took
out
his
and
gave
her
a
note
i
be
round
and
see
what
can
be
done
he
shut
himself
into
his
room
again
and
zerrilla
dried
her
tears
put
the
note
into
her
bosom
and
went
her
way
lapham
kept
the
porter
nearly
an
hour
later
it
was
then
six
the
hour
at
which
the
laphams
usually
had
tea
but
all
custom
had
been
broken
up
with
him
during
the
past
months
and
he
did
not
go
home
now
he
determined
perhaps
in
the
extremity
in
which
a
man
finds
relief
in
combating
one
care
with
another
to
keep
his
promise
to
miss
dewey
and
at
the
moment
when
he
might
otherwise
have
been
sitting
down
at
his
own
table
he
was
climbing
the
stairs
to
her
lodging
in
the
dwelling
which
had
been
portioned
off
into
flats
it
was
in
a
region
of
depots
and
of
the
cheap
hotels
and
ladies
and
gents
and
restaurants
with
bars
which
abound
near
depots
and
lapham
followed
to
miss
dewey
door
a
waiter
from
one
of
these
who
bore
on
a
salver
before
him
a
supper
covered
with
a
napkin
zerrilla
had
admitted
them
and
at
her
greeting
a
young
fellow
in
the
shabby
of
a
sailor
buttoning
imperfectly
over
the
nautical
blue
flannel
of
his
shirt
got
up
from
where
he
had
been
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
stove
and
stood
infirmly
on
his
feet
in
token
of
receiving
the
visitor
the
woman
who
sat
on
the
other
side
did
not
rise
but
began
a
shrill
defiant
apology
well
i
do
suppose
but
what
you
think
we
livin
on
the
fat
the
land
right
straight
along
all
the
while
but
it
just
like
this
when
that
child
came
in
from
her
work
she
did
seem
to
have
the
spirit
to
go
to
cookin
anything
and
i
had
such
a
bad
night
last
night
i
was
feelin
all
broke
up
and
s
i
what
the
use
anyway
by
the
time
the
butcher
heaved
in
a
lot
o
bone
and
made
you
pay
for
the
suet
he
cuts
away
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
and
why
not
git
it
from
the
first
off
and
save
the
cost
o
your
fire
s
i
what
have
you
got
there
under
your
apron
a
bottle
demanded
lapham
who
stood
with
his
hat
on
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
indifferent
alike
to
the
ineffective
reception
of
the
sailor
and
the
chair
zerrilla
had
set
him
well
yes
it
a
bottle
said
the
woman
with
an
assumption
of
virtuous
frankness
it
whisky
i
got
to
have
something
to
rub
my
rheumatism
with
humph
grumbled
lapham
you
been
rubbing
his
rheumatism
too
i
see
he
twisted
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
sailor
now
softly
and
rhythmically
waving
to
and
fro
on
his
feet
he
hai
had
a
drop
in
this
house
cried
the
woman
what
are
you
doing
around
here
said
lapham
turning
fiercely
upon
him
you
got
no
business
ashore
where
your
ship
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
you
come
here
and
eat
your
wife
out
of
house
and
home
and
then
give
money
to
keep
the
concern
going
just
the
very
words
i
said
when
he
first
showed
his
face
here
did
i
said
the
woman
eagerly
joining
in
the
rebuke
of
her
late
boon
companion
you
got
no
business
here
hen
i
you
ca
come
here
to
live
on
me
and
s
i
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
ship
s
i
that
what
i
said
the
sailor
mumbled
with
a
smile
of
tipsy
amiability
for
lapham
something
about
the
crew
being
discharged
yes
the
woman
broke
in
that
always
the
way
with
these
coasters
why
do
you
go
off
on
some
them
long
s
i
it
pretty
hard
when
wemmel
stands
ready
to
marry
and
provide
a
comfortable
home
for
us
both
i
hai
got
a
great
many
years
more
to
live
and
i
should
like
to
get
some
satisfaction
out
of
and
not
be
beholden
and
dependent
all
my
days
to
have
hen
here
blockin
the
way
i
tell
him
there
be
more
money
for
him
in
the
end
but
he
ca
seem
to
make
up
his
mind
to
it
well
now
look
here
said
lapham
i
do
care
anything
about
all
that
it
your
own
business
and
i
not
going
to
meddle
with
it
but

business
who
lives
off
me
and
so
i
tell
you
all
three
willing
to
take
care
of
zerrilla
and
i
willing
to
take
care
of
her
mother
i
guess
if

for
that
child
father
the
mother
interpolated
you
would
been
here
to
tell
the
tale
colonel
lapham

lapham
but
i
tell

said
the
old
woman
impartially
he

to
get
a
ship
and
he
got
to

life
for

and
night
you

bread

here
crowin
over

you
mind
what

mean
business
this
time
said
lapham
turning
to
the
door
the
woman
rose
and
followed
him
with
her
bottle
in
her
hand
say
colonel
what
should
you
advise
to
do
about
wemmel
i
tell
her
there
ai
any
use
goin
to
the
trouble
to
git
a
divorce
without
she
sure
about
him
do
you
think
we
ought
to
git
him
to
sign
a
paper
or
something
that
he
marry
her
if
she
gits
it
i
do
like
to
have
things
going
at
loose
ends
the
way
they
are
it
ai
sense
it
ai
right
lapham
made
no
answer
to
the
mother
anxious
for
her
child
future
and
concerned
for
the
moral
questions
involved
he
went
out
and
down
the
stairs
and
on
the
pavement
at
the
lower
door
he
almost
struck
against
rogers
who
had
a
bag
in
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
hurrying
towards
one
of
the
depots
he
halted
a
little
as
if
to
speak
to
lapham
but
lapham
turned
his
back
abruptly
upon
him
and
took
the
other
direction
the
days
were
going
by
in
a
monotony
of
adversity
to
him
from
which
he
could
no
longer
escape
even
at
home
he
attempted
once
or
twice
to
talk
of
his
troubles
to
his
wife
but
she
repulsed
him
sharply
she
seemed
to
despise
and
hate
him
but
he
set
himself
doggedly
to
make
a
confession
to
her
and
he
stopped
her
one
night
as
she
came
into
the
room
where
he
sat
hastily
upon
some
errand
that
was
to
take
her
directly
away
again
persis
there
something
i
got
to
tell
you
she
stood
still
as
if
fixed
against
her
will
to
listen
i
guess
you
know
something
about
it
already
and
i
guess
it
set
you
against
me
oh
i
guess
not
colonel
lapham
you
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
that
all
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
listening
with
a
cold
hard
smile
on
her
face
i
do
say
it
to
make
favour
with
you
because
i
do
want
you
to
spare
me
and
i
do
ask
you
but
i
got
into
it
through
milton
k
rogers
oh
said
lapham
contemptuously
i
always
felt
the
way
i
said
about
it
that
it
any
better
than
gambling
and
i
say
so
now
it
like
betting
on
the
turn
of
a
card
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
persis
that
i
never
was
in
it
at
all
till
that
scoundrel
began
to
load
me
up
with
those
securities
of
his
then
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
ought
to
try
to
do
something
to
get
somewhere
even
i
know
it
no
excuse
but
watching
the
market
to
see
what
the
infernal
things
were
worth
from
day
to
day
and
seeing
it
go
up
and
seeing
it
go
down
was
too
much
for
me
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
began
to
buy
and
sell
on
a
margin
just
what
i
told
you
i
never
would
do
i
seemed
to
make
something
i
did
make
something
and
i
have
stopped
i
do
believe
if
i
could
have
reached
the
figure
i
set
in
my
own
mind
to
start
with
but
i
could
fetch
it
i
began
to
lose
and
then
i
began
to
throw
good
money
after
bad
just
as
i
always
did
with
everything
that
rogers
ever
came
within
a
mile
of
well
what
the
use
i
lost
the
money
that
would
have
carried
me
out
of
this
and
i
should
have
had
to
shut
down
the
works
or
sell
the
house
or
lapham
stopped
his
wife
who
at
first
had
listened
with
mystification
and
then
dawning
incredulity
changing
into
a
look
of
relief
that
was
almost
triumph
lapsed
again
into
severity
silas
lapham
if
you
was
to
die
the
next
minute
is
this
what
you
started
to
tell
me
why
of
course
it
is
what
did
you
suppose
i
started
to
tell
you
and
look
me
in
the
eyes
you
have
got
anything
else
on
your
mind
now
no
there
trouble
enough
the
lord
knows
but
there
nothing
else
to
tell
you
i
suppose
pen
gave
you
a
hint
about
it
i
dropped
something
to
her
i
been
feeling
bad
about
it
persis
a
good
while
but
i
hai
had
the
heart
to
speak
of
it
i
ca
expect
you
to
say
you
like
it
i
been
a
fool
i
allow
and
i
been
something
worse
if
you
choose
to
say
so
but
that
all
i
hurt
anybody
but
myself
and
you
and
the
children
lapham
rose
and
said
with
her
face
from
him
as
she
turned
towards
the
door
it
all
right
silas
i
sha
ever
bring
it
up
against
you
she
fled
out
of
the
room
but
all
that
evening
she
was
very
sweet
with
him
and
seemed
to
wish
in
all
tacit
ways
to
atone
for
her
past
unkindness
she
made
him
talk
of
his
business
and
he
told
her
of
corey
offer
and
what
he
had
done
about
it
she
did
not
seem
to
care
for
his
part
in
it
however
at
which
lapham
was
silently
disappointed
a
little
for
he
would
have
liked
her
to
praise
him
he
did
it
on
account
of
pen
well
he
did
insist
upon
it
anyway
said
lapham
who
must
have
obscurely
expected
that
corey
would
recognise
his
own
magnanimity
by
repeating
his
offer
if
the
doubt
that
follows
a
action
the
question
whether
it
was
not
after
all
a
needless
folly
is
mixed
as
it
was
in
lapham
case
with
the
vague
belief
that
we
might
have
done
ourselves
a
good
turn
without
great
risk
of
hurting
any
one
else
by
being
a
little
less
unselfish
it
becomes
a
regret
that
is
hard
to
bear
since
corey
spoke
to
him
some
things
had
happened
that
gave
lapham
hope
again
i
going
to
tell
her
about
it
said
his
wife
and
she
showed
herself
impatient
to
make
up
for
the
time
she
had
lost
why
did
you
tell
me
before
silas
i
did
know
we
were
on
speaking
terms
before
said
lapham
sadly
yes
that
true
she
admitted
with
a
conscious
flush
i
hope
he
wo
think
pen
known
about
it
all
this
while
xxiv
that
evening
james
bellingham
came
to
see
corey
after
dinner
and
went
to
find
him
in
his
own
room
i
come
at
the
instance
of
colonel
lapham
said
the
uncle
he
was
at
my
office
and
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
did
you
know
that
he
was
in
difficulties
i
fancied
that
he
was
in
some
sort
of
trouble
and
i
had
the
conjectures
he
does
really
know
much
about
it
well
he
thinks
it
time
on
all
accounts
that
you
should
know
how
he
stands
and
why
he
declined
that
proposition
of
yours
i
must
say
he
has
behaved
very
well
like
a
gentleman
i
not
surprised
i
am
it
hard
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
where
your
interest
is
vitally
concerned
and
lapham
does
strike
me
as
a
man
who
in
the
habit
of
acting
from
the
best
in
him
always
do
any
of
us
asked
corey
not
all
of
us
at
any
rate
said
bellingham
it
must
have
cost
him
something
to
say
no
to
you
for
he
just
in
that
state
when
he
believes
that
this
or
that
chance
however
small
would
save
him
corey
was
silent
is
he
really
in
such
a
bad
way
it
hard
to
tell
just
where
he
stands
i
suspect
that
a
hopeful
temperament
and
fondness
for
round
numbers
have
always
caused
him
to
set
his
figures
beyond
his
actual
worth
i
do
say
that
he
been
dishonest
about
it
but
he
had
a
loose
way
of
estimating
his
assets
he
reckoned
his
wealth
on
the
basis
of
his
capital
and
some
of
his
capital
is
borrowed
he
lost
heavily
by
some
of
the
recent
failures
and
there
been
a
terrible
shrinkage
in
his
values
i
do
mean
merely
in
the
stock
of
paint
on
hand
but
in
a
kind
of
competition
which
has
become
very
threatening
you
know
about
that
west
virginian
paint
corey
nodded
well
he
tells
me
that
they
struck
a
vein
of
natural
gas
out
there
which
will
enable
them
to
make
as
good
a
paint
as
his
own
at
a
cost
of
manufacturing
so
low
that
they
can
undersell
him
everywhere
if
this
proves
to
be
the
case
it
will
not
only
drive
his
paint
out
of
the
market
but
will
reduce
the
value
of
his
works
the
whole
plant
at
lapham
to
a
merely
nominal
figure
i
see
said
corey
dejectedly
i
understood
that
he
had
put
a
great
deal
of
money
into
his
works
yes
and
he
estimated
his
mine
there
at
a
high
figure
of
course
it
will
be
worth
little
or
nothing
if
the
west
virginia
paint
drives
his
out
then
besides
lapham
has
been
into
several
things
outside
of
his
own
business
and
like
a
good
many
other
men
who
try
outside
things
he
kept
account
of
them
himself
and
he
all
mixed
up
about
them
he
asked
me
to
look
into
his
affairs
with
him
and
i
promised
to
do
so
whether
he
can
be
tided
over
his
difficulties
remains
to
be
seen
i
afraid
it
will
take
a
good
deal
of
money
to
do
it
a
great
deal
more
than
he
thinks
at
least
he
believes
comparatively
little
would
do
it
i
think
differently
i
think
that
anything
less
than
a
great
deal
would
be
thrown
away
on
him
if
it
were
merely
a
question
of
a
certain
sum
even
a
large
sum
to
keep
him
going
it
might
be
managed
but
it
much
more
complicated
and
as
i
say
it
must
have
been
a
trial
to
him
to
refuse
your
offer
this
did
not
seem
to
be
the
way
in
which
bellingham
had
meant
to
conclude
but
he
said
no
more
and
corey
made
him
no
response
he
remained
pondering
the
case
now
hopefully
now
doubtfully
and
wondering
whatever
his
mood
was
whether
penelope
knew
anything
of
the
fact
with
which
her
mother
went
nearly
at
the
same
moment
to
acquaint
her
of
course
he
done
it
on
your
account
lapham
could
not
help
saying
then
he
was
very
silly
does
he
think
i
would
let
him
give
father
money
and
if
father
lost
it
for
him
does
he
suppose
it
would
make
it
any
easier
for
me
i
think
father
acted
twice
as
well
it
was
very
silly
in
repeating
the
censure
her
look
was
not
so
severe
as
her
tone
she
even
smiled
a
little
and
her
mother
reported
to
her
father
that
she
acted
more
like
herself
than
she
had
yet
since
corey
offer
i
think
if
he
was
to
repeat
his
offer
she
would
have
him
now
said
lapham
well
i
let
her
know
if
he
does
said
the
colonel
i
guess
he
wo
do
it
to
you
she
cried
who
else
will
he
do
it
to
he
demanded
they
perceived
that
they
had
each
been
talking
of
a
different
offer
after
lapham
went
to
his
business
in
the
morning
the
postman
brought
another
letter
from
irene
which
was
full
of
pleasant
things
that
were
happening
to
her
there
was
a
great
deal
about
her
cousin
will
as
she
called
him
at
the
end
she
had
written
tell
pen
i
do
want
she
should
be
foolish
there
said
lapham
i
guess
it
going
to
come
out
right
all
round
and
it
seemed
as
if
even
the
difficulties
were
past
when
your
father
gets
through
this
pen
she
asked
impulsively
what
shall
you
do
what
have
you
been
telling
irene
about
me
nothing
much
what
should
you
do
it
would
be
a
good
deal
easier
to
say
what
i
should
do
if
father
did
said
the
girl
i
know
you
think
it
was
nice
in
him
to
make
your
father
that
offer
urged
the
mother
it
was
nice
yes
but
it
was
silly
said
the
girl
most
nice
things
are
silly
i
suppose
she
added
she
went
to
her
room
and
wrote
a
letter
it
was
very
long
and
very
carefully
written
and
when
she
read
it
over
she
tore
it
into
small
pieces
she
wrote
another
one
short
and
hurried
and
tore
that
up
too
then
she
went
back
to
her
mother
in
the
family
room
and
asked
to
see
irene
letter
and
read
it
over
to
herself
yes
she
seems
to
be
having
a
good
time
she
sighed
mother
do
you
think
i
ought
to
let
corey
know
that
i
know
about
it
well
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
him
said
lapham
judicially
i
not
so
sure
of
that
the
way
i
should
have
to
tell
him
i
should
begin
by
giving
him
a
scolding
of
course
he
meant
well
by
it
but
ca
you
see
that
it
was
very
flattering
how
did
he
expect
it
would
change
me
i
do
believe
he
ever
thought
of
that
do
you
why
because
you
can
see
that
he
is
one
of
that
kind
he
might
want
to
please
you
without
wanting
to
change
you
by
what
he
did
yes
he
must
have
known
that
nothing
would
change
me
at
least
nothing
that
he
could
do
i
thought
of
that
i
should
like
him
to
feel
that
i
could
appreciate
it
even
if
i
did
think
it
was
silly
should
you
write
to
him
i
do
see
why
not
it
would
be
too
pointed
no
i
shall
just
let
it
go
i
wish
he
had
done
it
well
he
has
done
it
and
i
tried
to
write
to
him
about
it
two
letters
one
so
humble
and
grateful
that
it
could
stand
up
on
its
edge
and
the
other
so
pert
and
flippant
mother
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
those
two
letters
i
wish
i
had
kept
them
to
look
at
if
i
ever
got
to
thinking
i
had
any
sense
again
they
would
take
the
conceit
out
of
me
what
the
reason
he
do
come
here
any
more
does
he
come
asked
penelope
in
turn
as
if
it
were
something
she
had
not
noticed
particularly
you
ought
to
know
yes
she
sat
silent
a
while
if
he
does
come
i
suppose
because
he
offended
at
something
i
did
what
did
you
do
nothing
i
wrote
to
him
a
little
while
ago
i
suppose
it
was
very
blunt
but
i
did
believe
he
would
be
angry
at
it
but
this
this
that
he
done
shows
he
was
angry
and
that
he
was
just
seizing
the
first
chance
to
get
out
of
it
what
have
you
done
pen
demanded
her
mother
sharply
oh
i
do
know
all
the
mischief
in
the
world
i
suppose
tell
you
when
you
first
told
me
that
father
was
in
trouble
with
his
business
i
wrote
to
him
not
to
come
any
more
till
i
let
him
i
said
i
could
tell
him
why
and
he
has
been
here
since
i
sure
i
know
what
it
means
her
mother
looked
at
her
with
angry
severity
well
penelope
lapham
for
a
sensible
child
you
are
the
greatest
goose
i
ever
saw
did
you
think
he
would
come
here
and
see
if
you
would
let
him
come
he
might
have
written
urged
the
girl
her
mother
made
that
despairing
tchk
with
her
tongue
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
i
should
have
despised
him
if
he
had
written
acted
just
exactly
right
and
you
you
acted
i
do
know
how
you
acted
i
ashamed
of
you
a
girl
that
could
be
so
sensible
for
her
sister
and
always
say
and
do
just
the
right
thing
and
then
when
it
comes
to
herself
to
be
such
a
disgusting
simpleton
i
thought
i
ought
to
break
with
him
at
once
and
not
let
him
suppose
that
there
was
any
hope
for
him
or
me
if
father
was
poor
it
was
my
one
chance
in
this
whole
business
to
do
anything
heroic
and
i
jumped
at
it
you
must
think
because
i
can
laugh
at
it
now
that
i
in
earnest
mother
i
was
dead
but
the
colonel
has
gone
to
ruin
so
gradually
that
he
spoilt
everything
i
expected
that
he
would
be
bankrupt
the
next
day
and
that
then
he
would
understand
what
i
meant
but
to
have
it
drag
along
for
a
fortnight
seems
to
take
all
the
heroism
out
of
it
and
leave
it
as
flat
she
looked
at
her
mother
with
a
smile
that
shone
through
her
tears
and
a
pathos
that
quivered
round
her
jesting
lips
it
easy
enough
to
be
sensible
for
other
people
but
when
it
comes
to
myself
there
i
am
especially
when
i
want
to
do
what
i
ought
so
much
that
it
seems
as
if
doing
what
i
did
want
to
do
must
be
doing
what
i
ought
but
it
been
a
great
success
one
way
mother
it
helped
me
to
keep
up
before
the
colonel
if
it
been
for
corey
staying
away
and
my
feeling
so
indignant
with
him
for
having
been
badly
treated
by
me
i
should
have
been
worth
anything
at
all
the
tears
started
down
her
cheeks
but
her
mother
said
well
now
go
along
and
write
to
him
it
do
matter
what
you
say
much
and
be
so
very
particular
her
third
attempt
at
a
letter
pleased
her
scarcely
better
than
the
rest
but
she
sent
it
though
it
seemed
so
blunt
and
awkward
she
wrote
dear
friend
i
expected
when
i
sent
you
that
note
that
you
would
understand
almost
the
next
day
why
i
could
not
see
you
any
more
you
must
know
now
and
you
must
not
think
that
if
anything
happened
to
my
father
i
should
wish
you
to
help
him
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
thank
you
and
i
do
thank
you
for
offering
it
was
like
you
i
will
say
that
yours
sincerely
penelope
lapham
she
posted
her
letter
and
he
sent
his
reply
in
the
evening
by
hand
dearest
what
i
did
was
nothing
till
you
praised
it
everything
i
have
and
am
is
yours
wo
you
send
a
line
by
the
bearer
to
say
that
i
may
come
to
see
you
i
know
how
you
feel
but
i
am
sure
that
i
can
make
you
think
differently
you
must
consider
that
i
loved
you
without
a
thought
of
your
father
circumstances
and
always
shall
the
generous
words
were
blurred
to
her
eyes
by
the
tears
that
sprang
into
them
but
she
could
only
write
in
answer
please
do
not
come
i
have
made
up
my
mind
as
long
as
this
trouble
is
hanging
over
us
i
can
not
see
you
and
if
father
is
unfortunate
all
is
over
between
us
she
brought
his
letter
to
her
mother
and
told
her
what
she
had
written
in
reply
her
mother
was
thoughtful
a
while
before
she
said
with
a
sigh
well
i
hope
you
begun
as
you
can
carry
out
pen
oh
i
shall
not
have
to
carry
out
at
all
i
shall
not
have
to
do
anything
that
one
comfort
the
only
comfort
she
went
away
to
her
own
room
and
when
lapham
told
her
husband
of
the
affair
he
was
silent
at
first
as
she
had
been
then
he
said
i
do
know
as
i
should
have
wanted
her
to
done
differently
i
do
know
as
she
could
if
i
ever
come
right
again
she
wo
have
anything
to
feel
meeching
about
and
if
i
do
i
do
want
she
should
be
beholden
to
anybody
and
i
guess
that
the
way
she
feels
the
coreys
in
their
turn
sat
in
judgment
on
the
fact
which
their
son
felt
bound
to
bring
to
their
knowledge
she
has
behaved
very
well
said
corey
to
whom
her
son
had
spoken
my
dear
said
her
husband
with
his
laugh
she
has
behaved
too
well
if
she
had
studied
the
whole
situation
with
the
most
artful
eye
to
its
mastery
she
could
not
possibly
have
behaved
better
the
process
of
lapham
financial
disintegration
was
like
the
course
of
some
chronic
disorder
which
has
fastened
itself
upon
the
constitution
but
advances
with
continual
reliefs
with
apparent
amelioration
and
at
times
seems
not
to
advance
at
all
when
it
gives
hope
of
final
recovery
not
only
to
the
sufferer
but
to
the
eye
of
science
itself
there
were
moments
when
james
bellingham
seeing
lapham
pass
this
crisis
and
that
began
to
fancy
that
he
might
pull
through
altogether
and
at
these
moments
when
his
adviser
could
not
oppose
anything
but
experience
and
probability
to
the
evidence
of
the
fact
lapham
was
buoyant
with
courage
and
imparted
his
hopefulness
to
his
household
our
theory
of
disaster
of
sorrow
of
affliction
borrowed
from
the
poets
and
novelists
is
that
it
is
incessant
but
every
passage
in
our
own
lives
and
in
the
lives
of
others
so
far
as
we
have
witnessed
them
teaches
us
that
this
is
false
the
house
of
mourning
is
decorously
darkened
to
the
world
but
within
itself
it
is
also
the
house
of
laughing
bursts
of
gaiety
as
heartfelt
as
its
grief
relieve
the
gloom
and
the
stricken
survivors
have
their
jests
together
in
which
the
thought
of
the
dead
is
tenderly
involved
and
a
fond
sense
not
crazier
than
many
others
of
sympathy
and
enjoyment
beyond
the
silence
justifies
the
sunnier
mood
before
sorrow
rushes
back
deploring
and
despairing
and
making
it
all
up
again
with
the
conventional
fitness
of
things
lapham
adversity
had
this
quality
in
common
with
bereavement
it
was
not
always
like
the
adversity
we
figure
in
allegory
it
had
its
moments
of
being
like
prosperity
and
if
upon
the
whole
it
was
continual
it
was
not
incessant
sometimes
there
was
a
week
of
repeated
reverses
when
he
had
to
keep
his
teeth
set
and
to
hold
on
hard
to
all
his
hopefulness
and
then
days
came
of
negative
result
or
slight
success
when
he
was
full
of
his
jokes
at
the
and
wanted
to
go
to
the
theatre
or
to
do
something
to
cheer
penelope
up
in
some
miraculous
way
by
some
enormous
stroke
of
success
which
should
eclipse
the
brightest
of
his
past
prosperity
he
expected
to
do
what
would
reconcile
all
difficulties
not
only
in
his
own
affairs
but
in
hers
too
you
see
he
said
to
his
wife
it
going
to
come
out
all
right
irene
fix
it
up
with
bill
boy
and
then
she
be
off
pen
mind
and
if
things
go
on
as
they
been
going
for
the
last
two
days
i
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
do
the
favours
myself
and
pen
can
feel
that
she
makin
a
sacrifice
and
then
i
guess
may
be
do
it
if
things
turn
out
as
i
expect
now
and
times
ever
do
get
any
better
generally
i
can
show
corey
that
i
appreciate
his
offer
i
can
offer
him
the
partnership
myself
then
even
in
the
other
moods
which
came
when
everything
had
been
going
wrong
and
there
seemed
no
way
out
of
the
net
there
were
points
of
consolation
to
lapham
and
his
wife
they
rejoiced
that
irene
was
safe
beyond
the
range
of
their
anxieties
and
they
had
a
proud
satisfaction
that
there
had
been
no
engagement
between
corey
and
penelope
and
that
it
was
she
who
had
forbidden
it
in
the
closeness
of
interest
and
sympathy
in
which
their
troubles
had
reunited
them
they
confessed
to
each
other
that
nothing
would
have
been
more
galling
to
their
pride
than
the
idea
that
lapham
should
not
have
been
able
to
do
everything
for
his
daughter
that
the
coreys
might
have
expected
whatever
happened
now
the
coreys
could
not
have
it
to
say
that
the
laphams
had
tried
to
bring
any
such
thing
about
bellingham
had
lately
suggested
an
assignment
to
lapham
as
the
best
way
out
of
his
difficulties
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
the
money
to
meet
his
liabilities
at
present
and
that
he
could
not
raise
it
without
ruinous
sacrifices
that
might
still
end
in
ruin
after
all
if
he
made
the
assignment
bellingham
argued
he
could
gain
time
and
make
terms
the
state
of
things
generally
would
probably
improve
since
it
could
not
be
worse
and
the
market
which
he
had
glutted
with
his
paint
might
recover
and
he
could
start
again
lapham
had
not
agreed
with
him
when
his
reverses
first
began
it
had
seemed
easy
for
him
to
give
up
everything
to
let
the
people
he
owed
take
all
so
only
they
would
let
him
go
out
with
clean
hands
and
he
had
dramatised
this
feeling
in
his
talk
with
his
wife
when
they
spoke
together
of
the
mills
on
the
but
ever
since
then
it
had
been
growing
harder
and
he
could
not
consent
even
to
seem
to
do
it
now
in
the
proposed
assignment
he
had
not
found
other
men
so
very
liberal
or
faithful
with
him
a
good
many
of
them
appeared
to
have
combined
to
hunt
him
down
a
sense
of
enmity
towards
all
his
creditors
asserted
itself
in
him
he
asked
himself
why
they
should
not
suffer
a
little
too
above
all
he
shrank
from
the
publicity
of
the
assignment
it
was
open
confession
that
he
had
been
a
fool
in
some
way
he
could
not
bear
to
have
his
family
his
brother
the
judge
especially
to
whom
he
had
always
appeared
the
soul
of
business
wisdom
think
him
imprudent
or
stupid
he
would
make
any
sacrifice
before
it
came
to
that
he
determined
in
parting
with
bellingham
to
make
the
sacrifice
which
he
had
oftenest
in
his
mind
because
it
was
the
hardest
and
to
sell
his
new
house
that
would
cause
the
least
comment
most
people
would
simply
think
that
he
had
got
a
splendid
offer
and
with
his
usual
luck
had
made
a
very
good
thing
of
it
others
who
knew
a
little
more
about
him
would
say
that
he
was
hauling
in
his
horns
but
they
could
not
blame
him
a
great
many
other
men
were
doing
the
same
in
those
hard
times
the
shrewdest
and
safest
men
it
might
even
have
a
good
effect
he
went
straight
from
bellingham
office
to
the
broker
in
whose
hands
he
meant
to
put
his
house
for
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
when
he
had
once
made
up
his
mind
but
he
found
it
hard
to
get
his
voice
up
out
of
his
throat
when
he
said
he
guessed
he
would
get
the
broker
to
sell
that
new
house
of
his
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
the
broker
answered
cheerfully
yes
he
supposed
colonel
lapham
knew
it
was
a
pretty
dull
time
in
real
estate
and
lapham
said
yes
he
knew
that
but
he
should
not
sell
at
a
sacrifice
and
he
did
not
care
to
have
the
broker
name
him
or
describe
the
house
definitely
unless
parties
meant
business
again
the
broker
said
yes
and
he
added
as
a
joke
lapham
would
appreciate
that
he
had
half
a
dozen
houses
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
on
the
same
terms
that
nobody
wanted
to
be
named
or
to
have
his
property
described
it
did
in
fact
comfort
lapham
a
little
to
find
himself
in
the
same
boat
with
so
many
others
he
smiled
grimly
and
said
in
his
turn
yes
he
guessed
that
was
about
the
size
of
it
with
a
good
many
people
but
he
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
his
wife
what
he
had
done
and
he
sat
taciturn
that
whole
evening
without
even
going
over
his
accounts
and
went
early
to
bed
where
he
lay
tossing
half
the
night
before
he
fell
asleep
he
slept
at
last
only
upon
the
promise
he
made
himself
that
he
would
withdraw
the
house
from
the
broker
hands
but
he
went
heavily
to
his
own
business
in
the
morning
without
doing
so
there
was
no
such
rush
anyhow
he
reflected
bitterly
there
would
be
time
to
do
that
a
month
later
probably
it
struck
him
with
a
sort
of
dismay
when
a
boy
came
with
a
note
from
a
broker
saying
that
a
party
who
had
been
over
the
house
in
the
fall
had
come
to
him
to
know
whether
it
could
be
bought
and
was
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
house
up
to
the
time
he
had
seen
it
lapham
took
refuge
in
trying
to
think
who
the
party
could
be
he
concluded
that
it
must
have
been
somebody
who
had
gone
over
it
with
the
architect
and
he
did
not
like
that
but
he
was
aware
that
this
was
not
an
answer
to
the
broker
and
he
wrote
that
he
would
give
him
an
answer
in
the
morning
now
that
it
had
come
to
the
point
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
could
part
with
the
house
so
much
of
his
hope
for
himself
and
his
children
had
gone
into
it
that
the
thought
of
selling
it
made
him
tremulous
and
sick
he
could
not
keep
about
his
work
steadily
and
with
his
nerves
shaken
by
want
of
sleep
and
the
shock
of
this
sudden
and
unexpected
question
he
left
his
office
early
and
went
over
to
look
at
the
house
and
try
to
bring
himself
to
some
conclusion
here
the
long
procession
of
lamps
on
the
beautiful
street
was
flaring
in
the
clear
red
of
the
sunset
towards
which
it
marched
and
lapham
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
stopped
in
front
of
his
house
and
looked
at
their
multitude
they
were
not
merely
a
part
of
the
landscape
they
were
a
part
of
his
pride
and
glory
his
success
his
triumphant
life
work
which
was
fading
into
failure
in
his
helpless
hands
he
ground
his
teeth
to
keep
down
that
lump
but
the
moisture
in
his
eyes
blurred
the
lamps
and
the
keen
pale
crimson
against
which
it
made
them
flicker
he
turned
and
looked
up
as
he
had
so
often
done
at
the
neatly
glazed
for
the
winter
with
white
linen
and
recalled
the
night
when
he
had
stopped
with
irene
before
the
house
and
she
had
said
that
she
should
never
live
there
and
he
had
tried
to
coax
her
into
courage
about
it
there
was
no
such
facade
as
that
on
the
whole
street
to
his
thinking
through
his
long
talks
with
the
architect
he
had
come
to
feel
almost
as
intimately
and
fondly
as
the
architect
himself
the
satisfying
simplicity
of
the
whole
design
and
the
delicacy
of
its
detail
it
appealed
to
him
as
an
exquisite
bit
of
harmony
appeals
to
the
unlearned
ear
and
he
recognised
the
difference
between
this
fine
work
and
the
obstreperous
pretentiousness
of
the
many
overloaded
which
seymour
had
made
him
notice
for
his
instruction
elsewhere
on
the
back
bay
now
in
the
depths
of
his
gloom
he
tried
to
think
what
italian
city
it
was
where
seymour
said
he
had
first
got
the
notion
of
treating
in
that
way
he
unlocked
the
temporary
door
with
the
key
he
always
carried
so
that
he
could
let
himself
in
and
out
whenever
he
liked
and
entered
the
house
dim
and
very
cold
with
the
accumulated
frigidity
of
the
whole
winter
in
it
and
looking
as
if
the
arrest
of
work
upon
it
had
taken
place
a
thousand
years
before
it
smelt
of
the
unpainted
woods
and
the
clean
hard
surfaces
of
the
plaster
where
the
experiments
in
decoration
had
left
it
untouched
and
mingled
with
these
odours
was
that
of
some
rank
pigments
and
metallic
compositions
which
seymour
had
used
in
trying
to
realise
a
certain
daring
novelty
of
finish
which
had
not
proved
successful
above
all
lapham
detected
the
peculiar
odour
of
his
own
paint
with
which
the
architect
had
been
greatly
interested
one
day
when
lapham
showed
it
to
him
at
the
office
he
had
asked
lapham
to
let
him
try
the
persis
brand
in
realising
a
little
idea
he
had
for
the
finish
of
lapham
room
if
it
succeeded
they
could
tell
her
what
it
was
for
a
surprise
lapham
glanced
at
the
in
the
where
he
sat
with
his
girls
on
the
trestles
when
corey
first
came
by
and
then
he
explored
the
whole
house
to
the
attic
in
the
light
faintly
admitted
through
the
linen
sashes
the
floors
were
strewn
with
shavings
and
chips
which
the
carpenters
had
left
and
in
the
these
had
been
blown
into
long
irregular
windrows
by
the
draughts
through
a
wide
rent
in
the
linen
sash
lapham
tried
to
pin
it
up
but
failed
and
stood
looking
out
of
it
over
the
water
the
ice
had
left
the
river
and
the
low
tide
lay
smooth
and
red
in
the
light
of
the
sunset
the
cambridge
flats
showed
the
sad
sodden
yellow
of
meadows
stripped
bare
after
a
long
sleep
under
snow
the
hills
the
naked
trees
the
spires
and
roofs
had
a
black
outline
as
if
they
were
objects
in
a
landscape
of
the
french
school
the
whim
seized
lapham
to
test
the
chimney
in
the
it
had
been
tried
in
the
below
and
in
his
girls
fireplaces
above
but
here
the
hearth
was
still
clean
he
gathered
some
shavings
and
blocks
together
and
kindled
them
and
as
the
flame
mounted
gaily
from
them
he
pulled
up
a
which
he
found
there
and
sat
down
to
watch
it
nothing
could
have
been
better
the
chimney
was
a
perfect
success
and
as
lapham
glanced
out
of
the
torn
linen
sash
he
said
to
himself
that
that
party
whoever
he
was
who
had
offered
to
buy
his
house
might
go
to
the
devil
he
would
never
sell
it
as
long
as
he
had
a
dollar
he
said
that
he
should
pull
through
yet
and
it
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
that
if
he
could
raise
the
money
to
buy
out
those
west
virginia
fellows
he
should
be
all
right
and
would
have
the
whole
game
in
his
own
hand
he
slapped
himself
on
the
thigh
and
wondered
that
he
had
never
thought
of
that
before
and
then
lighting
a
cigar
with
a
splinter
from
the
fire
he
sat
down
again
to
work
the
scheme
out
in
his
own
mind
he
did
not
hear
the
feet
heavily
stamping
up
the
stairs
and
coming
towards
the
room
where
he
sat
and
the
policeman
to
whom
the
feet
belonged
had
to
call
out
to
him
smoking
at
his
with
his
back
turned
to
the
door
hello
what
are
you
doing
here
what
that
to
you
retorted
lapham
wheeling
half
round
on
his
i
show
you
said
the
officer
advancing
upon
him
and
then
stopping
short
as
he
recognised
him
why
colonel
lapham
i
thought
it
was
some
tramp
got
in
here
have
a
cigar
said
lapham
hospitably
sorry
there
ai
another
the
officer
took
the
cigar
i
smoke
it
outside
i
just
come
on
and
i
ca
stop
tryin
your
chimney
yes
i
thought
i
see
how
it
would
draw
in
here
it
seems
to
go
the
policeman
looked
about
him
with
an
eye
of
inspection
you
want
to
get
that
linen
window
there
mended
up
yes
i
speak
to
the
builder
about
that
it
can
go
for
one
night
the
policeman
went
to
the
window
and
failed
to
pin
the
linen
together
where
lapham
had
failed
before
i
ca
fix
it
he
looked
round
once
more
and
saying
well
good
night
went
out
and
down
the
stairs
lapham
remained
by
the
fire
till
he
had
smoked
his
cigar
then
he
rose
and
stamped
upon
the
embers
that
still
burned
with
his
heavy
boots
and
went
home
he
was
very
cheerful
at
supper
he
told
his
wife
that
he
guessed
he
had
a
sure
thing
of
it
now
and
in
another
hours
he
should
tell
her
just
how
he
made
penelope
go
to
the
theatre
with
him
and
when
they
came
out
after
the
play
the
night
was
so
fine
that
he
said
they
must
walk
round
by
the
new
house
and
take
a
look
at
it
in
the
starlight
he
said
he
had
been
there
before
he
came
home
and
tried
seymour
chimney
in
the
and
it
worked
like
a
charm
as
they
drew
near
beacon
street
they
were
aware
of
unwonted
stir
and
tumult
and
presently
the
still
air
transmitted
a
turmoil
of
sound
through
which
a
powerful
and
incessant
throbbing
made
itself
felt
the
sky
had
reddened
above
them
and
turning
the
corner
at
the
public
garden
they
saw
a
black
mass
of
people
obstructing
the
perspective
of
the
street
and
out
of
this
mass
a
engines
whose
strong
had
already
reached
them
sent
up
volumes
of
smoke
and
steam
from
their
funnels
ladders
were
planted
against
the
facade
of
a
building
from
the
roof
of
which
a
mass
of
flame
burnt
smoothly
upward
except
where
here
and
there
it
seemed
to
pull
contemptuously
away
from
the
heavy
streams
of
water
which
the
firemen
clinging
like
great
beetles
to
their
ladders
poured
in
upon
it
lapham
had
no
need
to
walk
down
through
the
crowd
gazing
and
gossiping
with
shouts
and
cries
and
hysterical
laughter
before
the
burning
house
to
make
sure
that
it
was
his
i
guess
i
done
it
pen
was
all
he
said
among
the
people
who
were
looking
at
it
were
a
party
who
seemed
to
have
run
out
from
dinner
in
some
neighbouring
house
the
ladies
were
fantastically
wrapped
up
as
if
they
had
flung
on
the
first
things
they
could
seize
is
it
perfectly
magnificent
cried
a
pretty
girl
i
have
missed
it
on
any
account
thank
you
so
much
symington
for
bringing
us
out
ah
i
thought
you
like
it
said
this
symington
who
must
have
been
the
host
and
you
can
enjoy
it
without
the
least
compunction
miss
delano
for
i
happen
to
know
that
the
house
belongs
to
a
man
who
could
afford
to
burn
one
up
for
you
once
a
year
oh
do
you
think
he
would
if
i
came
again
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
we
do
do
things
by
halves
in
boston
he
ought
to
have
had
a
coat
of
his
noncombustible
paint
on
it
said
another
gentleman
of
the
party
penelope
pulled
her
father
away
toward
the
first
carriage
she
could
reach
of
a
number
that
had
driven
up
here
father
get
into
this
no
no
i
could
ride
he
answered
heavily
and
he
walked
home
in
silence
he
greeted
his
wife
with
well
persis
our
house
is
gone
and
i
guess
i
set
it
on
fire
myself
and
while
he
rummaged
among
the
papers
in
his
desk
still
with
his
coat
and
hat
on
his
wife
got
the
facts
as
she
could
from
penelope
she
did
not
reproach
him
here
was
a
case
in
which
his
must
be
sufficiently
sharp
without
any
edge
from
her
besides
her
mind
was
full
of
a
terrible
thought
o
silas
she
faltered
they
think
you
set
it
on
fire
to
get
the
insurance
lapham
was
staring
at
a
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
i
had
a
builder
risk
on
it
but
it
expired
last
week
it
a
dead
loss
oh
thank
the
merciful
lord
cried
his
wife
merciful
said
lapham
well
it
a
queer
way
of
showing
it
he
went
to
bed
and
fell
into
the
deep
sleep
which
sometimes
follows
a
great
moral
shock
it
was
perhaps
rather
a
torpor
than
a
sleep
xxv
lapham
awoke
confused
and
in
a
kind
of
remoteness
from
the
loss
of
the
night
before
through
which
it
loomed
mistily
but
before
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
pillow
it
gathered
substance
and
weight
against
which
it
needed
all
his
will
to
bear
up
and
live
in
that
moment
he
wished
that
he
had
not
wakened
that
he
might
never
have
wakened
but
he
rose
and
faced
the
day
and
its
cares
the
morning
papers
brought
the
report
of
the
fire
and
the
conjectured
loss
the
reporters
somehow
had
found
out
the
fact
that
the
loss
fell
entirely
upon
lapham
they
lighted
up
the
hackneyed
character
of
their
statements
with
the
picturesque
interest
of
the
coincidence
that
the
policy
had
expired
only
the
week
before
heaven
knows
how
they
knew
it
they
said
that
nothing
remained
of
the
building
but
the
walls
and
lapham
on
his
way
to
business
walked
up
past
the
shell
the
windows
looked
like
the
of
a
skull
down
upon
the
blackened
and
trampled
snow
of
the
street
the
pavement
was
a
sheet
of
ice
and
the
water
from
the
engines
had
frozen
like
streams
of
tears
down
the
face
of
the
house
and
hung
in
icy
tags
from
the
and
copings
he
gathered
himself
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
went
on
to
his
office
the
chance
of
retrieval
that
had
flashed
upon
him
as
he
sat
smoking
by
that
ruined
hearth
the
evening
before
stood
him
in
such
stead
now
as
a
sole
hope
may
and
he
said
to
himself
that
having
resolved
not
to
sell
his
house
he
was
no
more
crippled
by
its
loss
than
he
would
have
been
by
letting
his
money
lie
idle
in
it
what
he
might
have
raised
by
mortgage
on
it
could
be
made
up
in
some
other
way
and
if
they
would
sell
he
could
still
buy
out
the
whole
business
of
that
west
virginia
company
mines
plant
stock
on
hand
and
everything
and
unite
it
with
his
own
he
went
early
in
the
afternoon
to
see
bellingham
whose
expressions
of
condolence
for
his
loss
he
cut
short
with
as
much
politeness
as
he
knew
how
to
throw
into
his
impatience
bellingham
seemed
at
first
a
little
dazzled
with
the
splendid
courage
of
his
scheme
it
was
certainly
fine
in
its
way
but
then
he
began
to
have
his
misgivings
i
happen
to
know
that
they
have
got
much
money
behind
them
urged
lapham
they
jump
at
an
offer
bellingham
shook
his
head
if
they
can
show
profit
on
the
old
manufacture
and
prove
they
can
make
their
paint
still
cheaper
and
better
hereafter
they
can
have
all
the
money
they
want
and
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
raise
it
if
you
threatened
by
them
with
that
competition
you
know
what
your
plant
at
lapham
would
be
worth
and
what
the
shrinkage
on
your
manufactured
stock
would
be
better
sell
out
to
them
he
concluded
if
they
will
buy
there
ai
money
enough
in
this
country
to
buy
out
my
paint
said
lapham
buttoning
up
his
coat
in
a
quiver
of
resentment
good
afternoon
sir
men
are
but
boys
after
all
bellingham
watched
this
perversely
proud
and
obstinate
child
fling
petulantly
out
of
his
door
and
felt
a
sympathy
for
him
which
was
as
truly
kind
as
it
was
helpless
but
lapham
was
beginning
to
see
through
bellingham
as
he
believed
bellingham
was
in
his
way
part
of
that
conspiracy
by
which
creditors
were
trying
to
drive
him
to
the
wall
more
than
ever
now
he
was
glad
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
race
and
that
the
favours
so
far
were
all
from
his
side
he
was
more
than
ever
determined
to
show
them
every
one
of
them
high
and
low
that
he
and
his
children
could
get
along
without
them
and
prosper
and
triumph
without
them
he
said
to
himself
that
if
penelope
were
engaged
to
corey
that
very
minute
he
would
make
her
break
with
him
he
knew
what
he
should
do
now
and
he
was
going
to
do
it
without
loss
of
time
he
was
going
on
to
new
york
to
see
those
west
virginia
people
they
had
their
principal
office
there
and
he
intended
to
get
at
their
ideas
and
then
he
intended
to
make
them
an
offer
he
managed
this
business
better
than
could
possibly
have
been
expected
of
a
man
in
his
impassioned
mood
but
when
it
came
really
to
business
his
practical
instincts
alert
and
wary
came
to
his
aid
against
the
passions
that
lay
in
wait
to
betray
after
they
ceased
to
dominate
him
he
found
the
west
virginians
full
of
zeal
and
hope
but
in
ten
minutes
he
knew
that
they
had
not
yet
tested
their
strength
in
the
money
market
and
had
not
ascertained
how
much
or
how
little
capital
they
could
command
lapham
himself
if
he
had
had
so
much
would
not
have
hesitated
to
put
a
million
dollars
into
their
business
he
saw
as
they
did
not
see
that
they
had
the
game
in
their
own
hands
and
that
if
they
could
raise
the
money
to
extend
their
business
they
could
ruin
him
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
he
was
on
the
ground
first
he
frankly
proposed
a
union
of
their
interests
he
admitted
that
they
had
a
good
thing
and
that
he
should
have
to
fight
them
hard
but
he
meant
to
fight
them
to
the
death
unless
they
could
come
to
some
sort
of
terms
now
the
question
was
whether
they
had
better
go
on
and
make
a
heavy
loss
for
both
sides
by
competition
or
whether
they
had
better
form
a
partnership
to
run
both
paints
and
command
the
whole
market
lapham
made
them
three
propositions
each
of
which
was
fair
and
open
to
sell
out
to
them
altogether
to
buy
them
out
altogether
to
join
facilities
and
forces
with
them
and
go
on
in
an
invulnerable
alliance
let
them
name
a
figure
at
which
they
would
buy
a
figure
at
which
they
would
sell
a
figure
at
which
they
would
combine
or
in
other
words
the
amount
of
capital
they
needed
they
talked
all
day
going
out
to
lunch
together
at
the
astor
house
and
sitting
with
their
knees
against
the
counter
on
a
row
of
stools
before
it
for
fifteen
minutes
of
reflection
and
deglutition
with
their
hats
on
and
then
returning
to
the
basement
from
which
they
emerged
the
west
virginia
company
name
was
lettered
in
gilt
on
the
wide
low
window
and
its
paint
in
the
form
of
ore
burnt
and
mixed
formed
a
display
on
the
window
shelf
lapham
examined
it
and
praised
it
from
time
to
time
they
all
recurred
to
it
together
they
sent
out
for
some
of
lapham
paint
and
compared
it
the
west
virginians
admitting
its
former
superiority
they
were
young
fellows
and
country
persons
like
lapham
by
origin
and
they
looked
out
with
the
same
amused
undaunted
provincial
eyes
at
the
myriad
metropolitan
legs
passing
on
the
pavement
above
the
level
of
their
window
he
got
on
well
with
them
at
last
they
said
what
they
would
do
they
said
it
was
nonsense
to
talk
of
buying
lapham
out
for
they
had
not
the
money
and
as
for
selling
out
they
would
not
do
it
for
they
knew
they
had
a
big
thing
but
they
would
as
soon
use
his
capital
to
develop
it
as
anybody
else
and
if
he
could
put
in
a
certain
sum
for
this
purpose
they
would
go
in
with
him
he
should
run
the
works
at
lapham
and
manage
the
business
in
boston
and
they
would
run
the
works
at
kanawha
falls
and
manage
the
business
in
new
york
the
two
brothers
with
whom
lapham
talked
named
their
figure
subject
to
the
approval
of
another
brother
at
kanawha
falls
to
whom
they
would
write
and
who
would
telegraph
his
answer
so
that
lapham
could
have
it
inside
of
three
days
but
they
felt
perfectly
sure
that
he
would
approve
and
lapham
started
back
on
the
eleven
train
with
an
elation
that
gradually
left
him
as
he
drew
near
boston
where
the
difficulties
of
raising
this
sum
were
to
be
over
come
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
those
fellows
had
put
it
up
on
him
pretty
steep
but
he
owned
to
himself
that
they
had
a
sure
thing
and
that
they
were
right
in
believing
they
could
raise
the
same
sum
elsewhere
it
would
take
all
of
it
he
admitted
to
make
their
paint
pay
on
the
scale
they
had
the
right
to
expect
at
their
age
he
would
not
have
done
differently
but
when
he
emerged
old
sore
and
from
the
in
the
albany
depot
at
boston
he
wished
with
a
pathetic
that
they
knew
how
a
man
felt
at
his
age
a
year
ago
six
months
ago
he
would
have
laughed
at
the
notion
that
it
would
be
hard
to
raise
the
money
but
he
thought
ruefully
of
that
immense
stock
of
paint
on
hand
which
was
now
a
drug
in
the
market
of
his
losses
by
rogers
and
by
the
failures
of
other
men
of
the
fire
that
had
licked
up
so
many
thousands
in
a
few
hours
he
thought
with
bitterness
of
the
tens
of
thousands
that
he
had
gambled
away
in
stocks
and
of
the
commissions
that
the
brokers
had
pocketed
whether
he
won
or
lost
and
he
could
not
think
of
any
securities
on
which
he
could
borrow
except
his
house
in
nankeen
square
or
the
mine
and
works
at
lapham
he
set
his
teeth
in
helpless
rage
when
he
thought
of
that
property
out
on
the
that
ought
to
be
worth
so
much
and
was
worth
so
little
if
the
road
chose
to
say
so
he
did
not
go
home
but
spent
most
of
the
day
shining
round
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
and
trying
to
see
if
he
could
raise
the
money
but
he
found
that
people
of
whom
he
hoped
to
get
it
were
in
the
conspiracy
which
had
been
formed
to
drive
him
to
the
wall
somehow
there
seemed
a
sense
of
his
embarrassments
abroad
nobody
wanted
to
lend
money
on
the
plant
at
lapham
without
taking
time
to
look
into
the
state
of
the
business
but
lapham
had
no
time
to
give
and
he
knew
that
the
state
of
the
business
would
not
bear
looking
into
he
could
raise
fifteen
thousand
on
his
nankeen
square
house
and
another
fifteen
on
his
beacon
street
lot
and
this
was
all
that
a
man
who
was
worth
a
million
by
rights
could
do
he
said
a
million
and
he
said
it
in
defiance
of
bellingham
who
had
subjected
his
figures
to
an
analysis
which
wounded
lapham
more
than
he
chose
to
show
at
the
time
for
it
proved
that
he
was
not
so
rich
and
not
so
wise
as
he
had
seemed
his
hurt
vanity
forbade
him
to
go
to
bellingham
now
for
help
or
advice
and
if
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
ask
his
brothers
for
money
it
would
have
been
useless
they
were
simply
western
people
but
not
capitalists
on
the
scale
he
required
lapham
stood
in
the
isolation
to
which
adversity
so
often
seems
to
bring
men
when
its
test
was
applied
practically
or
theoretically
to
all
those
who
had
seemed
his
friends
there
was
none
who
bore
it
and
he
thought
with
bitter
of
the
people
whom
he
had
befriended
in
their
time
of
need
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
been
a
fool
for
that
and
he
scorned
himself
for
certain
acts
of
scrupulosity
by
which
he
had
lost
money
in
the
past
seeing
the
moral
forces
all
arrayed
against
him
lapham
said
that
he
would
like
to
have
the
chance
offered
him
to
get
even
with
them
again
he
thought
he
should
know
how
to
look
out
for
himself
as
he
understood
it
he
had
several
days
to
turn
about
in
and
he
did
not
let
one
day
failure
dishearten
him
the
morning
after
his
return
he
had
in
fact
a
gleam
of
luck
that
gave
him
the
greatest
encouragement
for
the
moment
a
man
came
in
to
inquire
about
one
of
rogers
patents
as
lapham
called
them
and
ended
by
buying
it
he
got
it
of
course
for
less
than
lapham
took
it
for
but
lapham
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
for
something
when
he
had
thought
it
worth
nothing
and
when
the
transaction
was
closed
he
asked
the
purchaser
rather
eagerly
if
he
knew
where
rogers
was
it
was
lapham
secret
belief
that
rogers
had
found
there
was
money
in
the
thing
and
had
sent
the
man
to
buy
it
but
it
appeared
that
this
was
a
mistake
the
man
had
not
come
from
rogers
but
had
heard
of
the
patent
in
another
way
and
lapham
was
astonished
in
the
afternoon
when
his
boy
came
to
tell
him
that
rogers
was
in
the
outer
office
and
wished
to
speak
with
him
all
right
said
lapham
and
he
could
not
command
at
once
the
severity
for
the
reception
of
rogers
which
he
would
have
liked
to
use
he
found
himself
in
fact
so
much
relaxed
towards
him
by
the
morning
touch
of
prosperity
that
he
asked
him
to
sit
down
gruffly
of
course
but
distinctly
and
when
rogers
said
in
his
lifeless
way
and
with
the
effect
of
keeping
his
appointment
of
a
month
before
those
english
parties
are
in
town
and
would
like
to
talk
with
you
in
reference
to
the
mills
lapham
did
not
turn
him
he
sat
looking
at
him
and
trying
to
make
out
what
rogers
was
after
for
he
did
not
believe
that
the
english
parties
if
they
existed
had
any
notion
of
buying
his
mills
what
if
they
are
not
for
sale
he
asked
you
know
that
i
been
expecting
an
offer
from
the
i
kept
watch
of
that
they
have
made
you
any
offer
said
rogers
quietly
and
did
you
think
demanded
lapham
firing
up
that
i
would
turn
them
in
on
somebody
else
as
you
turned
them
in
on
me
when
the
chances
are
that
they
wo
be
worth
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
six
months
from
now
i
did
know
what
you
would
do
said
rogers
come
here
to
tell
you
that
these
parties
stand
ready
to
take
the
mills
off
your
hands
at
a
fair
valuation
at
the
value
i
put
upon
them
when
i
turned
them
in
i
do
believe
you
cried
lapham
brutally
but
a
wild
predatory
hope
made
his
heart
leap
so
that
it
seemed
to
turn
over
in
his
breast
i
do
believe
there
are
any
such
parties
to
begin
with
and
in
the
next
place
i
do
believe
they
would
buy
at
any
such
figure
unless
unless
you
lied
to
them
as
you
lied
to
me
did
you
tell
them
about
the
rogers
looked
compassionately
at
him
but
he
answered
with
unvaried
dryness
i
did
not
think
that
necessary
lapham
had
expected
this
answer
and
he
had
expected
or
intended
to
break
out
in
furious
denunciation
of
rogers
when
he
got
it
but
he
only
found
himself
saying
in
a
sort
of
baffled
gasp
i
wonder
what
your
game
is
rogers
did
not
reply
categorically
but
he
answered
with
his
impartial
calm
and
as
if
lapham
had
said
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
differed
at
all
with
him
as
to
disposing
of
the
property
in
the
way
he
had
suggested
if
we
should
succeed
in
selling
i
should
be
able
to
repay
you
your
loans
and
should
have
a
little
capital
for
a
scheme
that
i
think
of
going
into
and
do
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
steal
these
men
money
to
help
you
plunder
somebody
in
a
new
scheme
answered
lapham
the
sneer
was
on
behalf
of
virtue
but
it
was
still
a
sneer
i
suppose
the
money
would
be
useful
to
you
too
just
now
why
because
i
know
that
you
have
been
trying
to
borrow
at
this
proof
of
wicked
omniscience
in
rogers
the
question
whether
he
had
better
not
regard
the
affair
as
a
fatality
and
yield
to
his
destiny
flashed
upon
lapham
but
he
answered
i
shall
want
money
a
great
deal
worse
than
i
ever
wanted
it
yet
before
i
go
into
such
rascally
business
with
you
do
you
know
that
we
might
as
well
knock
these
parties
down
on
the
street
and
take
the
money
out
of
their
pockets
they
have
come
on
answered
rogers
from
portland
to
see
you
i
expected
them
some
weeks
ago
but
they
disappointed
me
they
arrived
on
the
circassian
last
night
they
expected
to
have
got
in
five
days
ago
but
the
passage
was
very
stormy
where
are
they
asked
lapham
with
helpless
irrelevance
and
feeling
himself
somehow
drifted
from
his
moorings
by
rogers
shipping
intelligence
they
are
at
young
i
told
them
we
would
call
upon
them
after
dinner
this
evening
they
dine
late
oh
you
did
did
you
asked
lapham
trying
to
drop
another
anchor
for
a
fresh
clutch
on
his
underlying
principles
well
now
you
go
and
tell
them
that
i
said
i
would
come
their
stay
is
limited
remarked
rogers
i
mentioned
this
evening
because
they
were
not
certain
they
could
remain
over
another
night
but
if
would
suit
you
better
tell
i
sha
come
at
all
roared
lapham
as
much
in
terror
as
defiance
for
he
felt
his
anchor
dragging
tell
i
sha
come
at
all
do
you
understand
that
i
do
see
why
you
should
stickle
as
to
the
matter
of
going
to
them
said
rogers
but
if
you
think
it
will
be
better
to
have
them
approach
you
i
suppose
i
can
bring
them
to
you
no
you
ca
i
sha
let
you
i
sha
see
them
i
sha
have
anything
to
do
with
them
now
do
you
understand
i
inferred
from
our
last
interview
persisted
rogers
unmoved
by
all
this
violent
demonstration
of
lapham
that
you
wished
to
meet
these
parties
you
told
me
that
you
would
give
me
time
to
produce
them
and
i
have
promised
them
that
you
would
meet
them
i
have
committed
myself
it
was
true
that
lapham
had
defied
rogers
to
bring
on
his
men
and
had
implied
his
willingness
to
negotiate
with
them
that
was
before
he
had
talked
the
matter
over
with
his
wife
and
perceived
his
moral
responsibility
in
it
even
she
had
not
seen
this
at
once
he
could
not
enter
into
this
explanation
with
rogers
he
could
only
say
i
said
give
you
hours
to
prove
yourself
a
liar
and
you
did
it
i
did
say
days
i
do
see
the
difference
returned
rogers
the
parties
are
here
now
and
that
proves
that
i
was
acting
in
good
faith
at
the
time
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
posture
of
affairs
you
do
know
now
any
more
than
you
knew
then
that
the
is
going
to
want
the
property
if
there
any
difference
it
in
favour
of
the
having
changed
its
mind
there
was
some
sense
in
this
and
lapham
felt
it
felt
it
only
too
eagerly
as
he
recognised
the
next
instant
rogers
went
on
quietly
you
not
obliged
to
sell
to
these
parties
when
you
meet
them
but
you
allowed
me
to
commit
myself
to
them
by
the
promise
that
you
would
talk
with
them
a
promise
said
lapham
it
was
the
same
thing
they
have
come
out
from
england
on
my
guaranty
that
there
was
such
and
such
an
opening
for
their
capital
and
now
what
am
i
to
say
to
them
it
places
me
in
a
ridiculous
position
rogers
urged
his
grievance
calmly
almost
impersonally
making
his
appeal
to
lapham
sense
of
justice
i
ca
go
back
to
those
parties
and
tell
them
you
wo
see
them
it
no
answer
to
make
they
got
a
right
to
know
why
you
wo
see
them
very
well
then
cried
lapham
i
come
and
tell
them
why
who
shall
i
ask
for
when
shall
i
be
there
at
eight
please
said
rogers
rising
without
apparent
alarm
at
his
threat
if
it
was
a
threat
and
ask
for
me
i
taken
a
room
at
the
hotel
for
the
present
i
wo
keep
you
five
minutes
when
i
get
there
said
lapham
but
he
did
not
come
away
till
ten
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
the
very
devil
was
in
it
the
englishmen
treated
his
downright
refusal
to
sell
as
a
piece
of
bluff
and
talked
on
as
though
it
were
merely
the
opening
of
the
negotiation
when
he
became
plain
with
them
in
his
anger
and
told
them
why
he
would
not
sell
they
seemed
to
have
been
prepared
for
this
as
a
stroke
of
business
and
were
ready
to
meet
it
has
this
fellow
he
demanded
twisting
his
head
in
the
direction
of
rogers
but
disdaining
to
notice
him
otherwise
been
telling
you
that
it
part
of
my
game
to
say
this
well
sir
i
can
tell
you
on
my
side
that
there
is
a
slipperier
rascal
unhung
in
america
than
milton
k
rogers
the
englishmen
treated
this
as
a
piece
of
genuine
american
humour
and
returned
to
the
charge
with
unabated
courage
they
owned
now
that
a
person
interested
with
them
had
been
out
to
look
at
the
property
and
that
they
were
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
things
they
developed
further
the
fact
that
they
were
not
acting
solely
or
even
principally
in
their
own
behalf
but
were
the
agents
of
people
in
england
who
had
projected
the
colonisation
of
a
sort
of
community
on
the
spot
somewhat
after
the
plan
of
other
english
dreamers
and
that
they
were
satisfied
from
a
careful
inspection
that
the
resources
and
facilities
were
those
best
calculated
to
develop
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
the
proposed
community
they
were
prepared
to
meet
lapham
colonel
they
begged
his
pardon
at
the
instance
of
rogers
at
any
reasonable
figure
and
were
quite
willing
to
assume
the
risks
he
had
pointed
out
something
in
the
eyes
of
these
men
something
that
lurked
at
an
infinite
depth
below
their
speech
and
was
not
really
in
their
eyes
when
lapham
looked
again
had
flashed
through
him
a
sense
of
treachery
in
them
he
had
thought
them
the
dupes
of
rogers
but
in
that
brief
instant
he
had
seen
them
or
thought
he
had
seen
them
his
accomplices
ready
to
betray
the
interests
of
which
they
went
on
to
speak
with
a
certain
comfortable
jocosity
and
a
certain
incredulous
slight
of
his
show
of
integrity
it
was
a
deeper
game
than
lapham
was
used
to
and
he
sat
looking
with
a
sort
of
admiration
from
one
englishman
to
the
other
and
then
to
rogers
who
maintained
an
exterior
of
modest
neutrality
and
whose
air
said
i
have
brought
you
gentlemen
together
as
the
friend
of
all
parties
and
i
now
leave
you
to
settle
it
among
yourselves
i
ask
nothing
and
expect
nothing
except
the
small
sum
which
shall
accrue
to
me
after
the
discharge
of
my
obligations
to
colonel
lapham
while
rogers
presence
expressed
this
one
of
the
englishmen
was
saying
and
if
you
have
any
scruple
in
allowin
us
to
assume
this
risk
colonel
lapham
perhaps
you
can
console
yourself
with
the
fact
that
the
loss
if
there
is
to
be
any
will
fall
upon
people
who
are
able
to
bear
it
upon
an
association
of
rich
and
charitable
people
but
we
quite
satisfied
there
will
be
no
loss
he
added
savingly
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
name
your
price
and
we
will
do
our
best
to
meet
it
there
was
nothing
in
the
englishman
sophistry
very
shocking
to
lapham
it
addressed
itself
in
him
to
that
not
evilly
intentioned
potential
immorality
which
regards
common
property
as
common
prey
and
gives
us
the
most
corrupt
municipal
governments
under
the
sun
which
makes
the
poorest
voter
when
he
has
tricked
into
place
as
unscrupulous
in
regard
to
others
money
as
an
hereditary
prince
lapham
met
the
englishman
eye
and
with
difficulty
kept
himself
from
winking
then
he
looked
away
and
tried
to
find
out
where
he
stood
or
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
could
hardly
tell
he
had
expected
to
come
into
that
room
and
unmask
rogers
and
have
it
over
but
he
had
unmasked
rogers
without
any
effect
whatever
and
the
play
had
only
begun
he
had
a
whimsical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
its
being
very
different
from
the
plays
at
the
theatre
he
could
not
get
up
and
go
away
in
silent
contempt
he
could
not
tell
the
englishmen
that
he
believed
them
a
pair
of
scoundrels
and
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
he
could
no
longer
treat
them
as
innocent
dupes
he
remained
baffled
and
perplexed
and
the
one
who
had
not
spoken
hitherto
remarked
of
course
we
sha
about
a
few
pound
more
or
less
if
colonel
lapham
figure
should
be
a
little
larger
than
ours
i
no
doubt
not
be
too
upon
us
in
the
end
lapham
appreciated
all
the
intent
of
this
subtle
suggestion
and
understood
as
plainly
as
if
it
had
been
said
in
so
many
words
that
if
they
paid
him
a
larger
price
it
was
to
be
expected
that
a
certain
portion
of
the
was
to
return
to
their
own
hands
still
he
could
not
move
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
speak
ring
that
bell
rogers
said
the
englishman
who
had
last
spoken
glancing
at
the
annunciator
button
in
the
wall
near
rogers
head
and
up
something
ca
you
i
should
like
to
wet
me
as
you
say
and
colonel
lapham
seems
to
find
it
rather
dry
work
lapham
jumped
to
his
feet
and
buttoned
his
overcoat
about
him
he
remembered
with
terror
the
dinner
at
corey
where
he
had
disgraced
and
betrayed
himself
and
if
he
went
into
this
thing
at
all
he
was
going
into
it
sober
i
ca
stop
he
said
i
must
be
going
but
you
have
given
us
an
answer
yet
lapham
said
the
first
englishman
with
a
successful
show
of
dignified
surprise
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
now
is
no
said
lapham
if
you
want
another
you
must
let
me
have
time
to
think
it
over
but
much
time
said
the
other
englishman
we
pressed
for
time
ourselves
and
we
hoped
for
an
answer
for
a
hanswer
he
corrected
himself
at
once
that
was
our
understandin
with
mr
rogers
i
ca
let
you
know
till
morning
anyway
said
lapham
and
he
went
out
as
his
custom
often
was
without
any
parting
salutation
he
thought
rogers
might
try
to
detain
him
but
rogers
had
remained
seated
when
the
others
got
to
their
feet
and
paid
no
attention
to
his
departure
he
walked
out
into
the
night
air
every
pulse
throbbing
with
the
strong
temptation
he
knew
very
well
those
men
would
wait
and
gladly
wait
till
the
morning
and
that
the
whole
affair
was
in
his
hands
it
made
him
groan
in
spirit
to
think
that
it
was
if
he
had
hoped
that
some
chance
might
take
the
decision
from
him
there
was
no
such
chance
in
the
present
or
future
that
he
could
see
it
was
for
him
alone
to
commit
this
rascality
if
it
was
a
rascality
or
not
he
walked
all
the
way
home
letting
one
car
after
another
pass
him
on
the
street
now
so
empty
of
other
passing
and
it
was
almost
eleven
when
he
reached
home
a
carriage
stood
before
his
house
and
when
he
let
himself
in
with
his
key
he
heard
talking
in
the
it
came
into
his
head
that
irene
had
got
back
unexpectedly
and
that
the
sight
of
her
was
somehow
going
to
make
it
harder
for
him
then
he
thought
it
might
be
corey
come
upon
some
desperate
pretext
to
see
penelope
but
when
he
opened
the
door
he
saw
with
a
certain
absence
of
surprise
that
it
was
rogers
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
talking
to
lapham
and
he
had
been
shedding
tears
dry
tears
they
seemed
and
they
had
left
a
sort
of
sandy
glistening
trace
on
his
cheeks
apparently
he
was
not
ashamed
of
them
for
the
expression
with
which
he
met
lapham
was
that
of
a
man
making
a
desperate
appeal
in
his
own
cause
which
was
identical
with
that
of
humanity
if
not
that
of
justice
i
some
expected
began
rogers
to
find
you
here
no
you
did
interrupted
lapham
you
wanted
to
come
here
and
make
a
poor
mouth
to
lapham
before
i
got
home
i
knew
that
lapham
would
know
what
was
going
on
said
rogers
more
candidly
but
not
more
virtuously
for
that
he
could
not
and
i
wished
her
to
understand
a
point
that
i
had
put
to
you
at
the
hotel
and
that
i
want
you
should
consider
and
i
want
you
should
consider
me
a
little
in
this
business
too
you
not
the
only
one
concerned
i
tell
you
and
i
been
telling
lapham
that
it
my
one
chance
that
if
you
do
meet
me
on
it
my
wife
and
children
will
be
reduced
to
beggary
so
will
mine
said
lapham
or
the
next
thing
to
it
well
then
i
want
you
to
give
me
this
chance
to
get
on
my
feet
again
you
no
right
to
deprive
me
of
it
it
unchristian
in
our
dealings
with
each
other
we
should
be
guided
by
the
golden
rule
as
i
was
saying
to
lapham
before
you
came
in
i
told
her
that
if
i
knew
myself
i
should
in
your
place
consider
the
circumstances
of
a
man
in
mine
who
had
honourably
endeavoured
to
discharge
his
obligations
to
me
and
had
patiently
borne
my
undeserved
suspicions
i
should
consider
that
family
i
told
mrs
lapham
did
you
tell
her
that
if
i
went
in
with
you
and
those
fellows
i
should
be
robbing
the
people
who
trusted
them
i
do
see
what
you
got
to
do
with
the
people
that
sent
them
here
they
are
rich
people
and
could
bear
it
if
it
came
to
the
worst
but
there
no
likelihood
now
that
it
will
come
to
the
worst
you
can
see
yourself
that
the
road
has
changed
its
mind
about
buying
and
here
am
i
without
a
cent
in
the
world
and
my
wife
is
an
invalid
she
needs
comforts
she
needs
little
luxuries
and
she
has
even
the
necessaries
and
you
want
to
sacrifice
her
to
a
mere
idea
you
know
in
the
first
place
that
the
road
will
ever
want
to
buy
and
if
it
does
the
probability
is
that
with
a
colony
like
that
planted
on
its
line
it
would
make
very
different
terms
from
what
it
would
with
you
or
me
these
agents
are
not
afraid
and
their
principals
are
rich
people
and
if
there
was
any
loss
it
would
be
divided
up
amongst
them
so
that
they
would
any
of
them
feel
it
lapham
stole
a
troubled
glance
at
his
wife
and
saw
that
there
was
no
help
in
her
whether
she
was
daunted
and
confused
in
her
own
conscience
by
the
outcome
so
evil
and
disastrous
of
the
reparation
to
rogers
which
she
had
forced
her
husband
to
make
or
whether
her
perceptions
had
been
blunted
and
darkened
by
the
appeals
which
rogers
had
now
used
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
probably
there
was
a
mixture
of
both
causes
in
the
effect
which
her
husband
felt
in
her
and
from
which
he
turned
girding
himself
anew
to
rogers
i
have
no
wish
to
recur
to
the
past
continued
rogers
with
growing
superiority
you
have
shown
a
proper
spirit
in
regard
to
that
and
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
wipe
it
out
i
should
think
i
had
said
lapham
i
used
up
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
trying
some
of
my
enterprises
rogers
admitted
have
been
unfortunate
seemingly
but
i
have
hopes
that
they
will
yet
turn
out
well
in
time
i
ca
understand
why
you
should
be
so
mindful
of
others
now
when
you
showed
so
little
regard
for
me
then
i
had
come
to
your
aid
at
a
time
when
you
needed
help
and
when
you
got
on
your
feet
you
kicked
me
out
of
the
business
i
do
complain
but
that
is
the
fact
and
i
had
to
begin
again
after
i
had
supposed
myself
settled
in
life
and
establish
myself
elsewhere
lapham
glanced
again
at
his
wife
her
head
had
fallen
he
could
see
that
she
was
so
rooted
in
her
old
remorse
for
that
questionable
act
of
his
amply
and
more
than
fully
atoned
for
since
that
she
was
helpless
now
in
the
crucial
moment
when
he
had
the
utmost
need
of
her
insight
he
had
counted
upon
her
he
perceived
now
that
when
he
had
thought
it
was
for
him
alone
to
decide
he
had
counted
upon
her
just
spirit
to
stay
his
own
in
its
struggle
to
be
just
he
had
not
forgotten
how
she
held
out
against
him
only
a
little
while
ago
when
he
asked
her
whether
he
might
not
rightfully
sell
in
some
such
contingency
as
this
and
it
was
not
now
that
she
said
or
even
looked
anything
in
favour
of
rogers
but
that
she
was
silent
against
him
which
dismayed
lapham
he
swallowed
the
lump
that
rose
in
his
throat
the
the
pity
for
her
the
despair
and
said
gently
i
guess
you
better
go
to
bed
persis
it
pretty
late
she
turned
towards
the
door
when
rogers
said
with
the
obvious
intention
of
detaining
her
through
her
curiosity
but
i
let
that
pass
and
i
do
ask
now
that
you
should
sell
to
these
men
lapham
paused
irresolute
what
are
you
making
this
bother
for
then
demanded
lapham
what
do
you
want
what
i
been
telling
your
wife
here
i
want
you
should
sell
to
me
i
do
say
what
i
going
to
do
with
the
property
and
you
will
not
have
an
iota
of
responsibility
whatever
happens
lapham
was
staggered
and
he
saw
his
wife
face
light
up
with
eager
question
i
want
that
property
continued
rogers
and
i
got
the
money
to
buy
it
what
will
you
take
for
it
if
it
the
price
you
standing
out
for
persis
said
lapham
go
to
bed
and
he
gave
her
a
look
that
meant
obedience
for
her
she
went
out
of
the
door
and
left
him
with
his
tempter
if
you
think
i
going
to
help
you
whip
the
devil
round
the
stump
you
mistaken
in
your
man
milton
rogers
said
lapham
lighting
a
cigar
as
soon
as
i
sold
to
you
you
would
sell
to
that
other
pair
of
rascals
i
smelt
out
in
half
a
minute
they
are
christian
gentlemen
said
rogers
but
i
do
purpose
defending
them
and
i
do
purpose
telling
you
what
i
shall
or
shall
not
do
with
the
property
when
it
is
in
my
hands
again
the
question
is
will
you
sell
and
if
so
what
is
your
figure
you
have
got
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
after
you
sold
it
was
perfectly
true
any
lawyer
would
have
told
him
the
same
he
could
not
help
admiring
rogers
for
his
ingenuity
and
every
selfish
interest
of
his
nature
joined
with
many
obvious
duties
to
urge
him
to
consent
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
refuse
there
was
no
longer
a
reason
he
was
standing
out
alone
for
nothing
any
one
else
would
say
he
smoked
on
as
if
rogers
were
not
there
and
rogers
remained
before
the
fire
as
patient
as
the
clock
ticking
behind
his
head
on
the
mantel
and
showing
the
gleam
of
its
pendulum
beyond
his
face
on
either
side
but
at
last
he
said
well
well
answered
lapham
you
ca
expect
me
to
give
you
an
answer
any
more
than
before
you
know
that
what
you
said
now
has
changed
the
thing
a
bit
i
wish
it
had
the
lord
knows
i
want
to
be
rid
of
the
property
fast
enough
then
why
do
you
sell
to
me
ca
you
see
that
you
will
not
be
responsible
for
what
happens
after
you
have
sold
no
i
ca
see
that
but
if
i
can
by
morning
i
sell
why
do
you
expect
to
know
any
better
by
morning
you
wasting
time
for
nothing
cried
rogers
in
his
disappointment
why
are
you
so
particular
when
you
drove
me
out
of
the
business
you
were
not
so
very
particular
lapham
winced
it
was
certainly
ridiculous
for
man
who
had
once
so
selfishly
consulted
his
own
interests
to
be
stickling
now
about
the
rights
of
others
i
guess
nothing
going
to
happen
overnight
he
answered
sullenly
anyway
i
sha
say
what
i
shall
do
till
morning
what
time
can
i
see
you
in
the
morning
nine
rogers
buttoned
his
coat
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
another
word
lapham
followed
him
to
close
the
after
him
his
wife
called
down
to
him
from
above
as
he
approached
the
room
again
well
i
told
him
i
let
him
know
in
the
morning
want
i
should
come
down
and
talk
with
you
no
answered
lapham
in
the
proud
bitterness
which
his
isolation
brought
you
could
do
any
good
he
went
in
and
shut
the
door
and
by
and
by
his
wife
heard
him
begin
walking
up
and
down
and
then
the
rest
of
the
night
she
lay
awake
and
listened
to
him
walking
up
and
down
but
when
the
first
light
whitened
the
window
the
words
of
the
scripture
came
into
her
mind
and
there
wrestled
a
man
with
him
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
and
he
said
let
me
go
for
the
day
breaketh
and
he
said
i
will
not
let
thee
go
except
thou
bless
me
she
could
not
ask
him
anything
when
they
met
but
he
raised
his
dull
eyes
after
the
first
silence
and
said
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
say
to
rogers
she
could
not
speak
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
she
saw
her
husband
when
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
from
the
window
drag
heavily
down
toward
the
corner
where
he
was
to
take
the
he
arrived
rather
later
than
usual
at
his
office
and
he
found
his
letters
already
on
his
table
there
was
one
long
and
with
a
printed
on
the
outside
and
lapham
had
no
need
to
open
it
in
order
to
know
that
it
was
the
offer
of
the
great
lacustrine
polar
railroad
for
his
mills
but
he
went
mechanically
through
the
verification
of
his
prophetic
fear
which
was
also
his
sole
hope
and
then
sat
looking
blankly
at
it
rogers
came
promptly
at
the
appointed
time
and
lapham
handed
him
the
letter
he
must
have
taken
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
seen
the
impossibility
of
negotiating
any
further
now
even
with
victims
so
pliant
and
willing
as
those
englishmen
you
ruined
me
rogers
broke
out
i
have
a
cent
left
in
the
world
god
help
my
poor
wife
he
went
out
and
lapham
remained
staring
at
the
door
which
closed
upon
him
this
was
his
reward
for
standing
firm
for
right
and
justice
to
his
own
destruction
to
feel
like
a
thief
and
a
murderer
xxvi
later
in
the
forenoon
came
the
despatch
from
the
west
virginians
in
new
york
saying
their
brother
assented
to
their
agreement
and
it
now
remained
for
lapham
to
fulfil
his
part
of
it
he
was
ludicrously
far
from
able
to
do
this
and
unless
he
could
get
some
extension
of
time
from
them
he
must
lose
this
chance
his
only
chance
to
retrieve
himself
he
spent
the
time
in
a
desperate
endeavour
to
raise
the
money
but
he
had
not
raised
the
half
of
it
when
the
banks
closed
with
shame
in
his
heart
he
went
to
bellingham
from
whom
he
had
parted
so
haughtily
and
laid
his
plan
before
him
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
bellingham
help
but
he
told
him
what
he
proposed
to
do
bellingham
pointed
out
that
the
whole
thing
was
an
experiment
and
that
the
price
asked
was
enormous
unless
a
great
success
were
morally
certain
he
advised
delay
he
advised
prudence
he
insisted
that
lapham
ought
at
least
to
go
out
to
kanawha
falls
and
see
the
mines
and
works
before
he
put
any
such
sum
into
the
development
of
the
enterprise
that
all
well
enough
cried
lapham
but
if
i
do
clinch
this
offer
within
hours
they
withdraw
it
and
go
into
the
market
and
then
where
am
i
go
on
and
see
them
again
said
bellingham
they
ca
be
so
peremptory
as
that
with
you
they
must
give
you
time
to
look
at
what
they
want
to
sell
if
it
turns
out
what
you
hope
then
i
see
what
can
be
done
but
look
into
it
thoroughly
well
cried
lapham
helplessly
submitting
he
took
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
he
had
forty
minutes
to
catch
the
four
train
he
hurried
back
to
his
office
and
put
together
some
papers
preparatory
to
going
and
despatched
a
note
by
his
boy
to
lapham
saying
that
he
was
starting
for
new
york
and
did
not
know
just
when
he
should
get
back
the
early
spring
day
was
raw
and
cold
as
he
went
out
through
the
office
he
saw
the
clerks
at
work
with
their
and
hats
on
miss
dewey
had
her
jacket
dragged
up
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
particularly
comfortless
as
she
operated
her
machine
with
her
red
fingers
what
up
asked
lapham
stopping
a
moment
seems
to
be
something
the
matter
with
the
steam
she
answered
with
the
air
of
unmerited
wrong
habitual
with
so
many
pretty
women
who
have
to
work
for
a
living
well
take
your
writer
into
my
room
there
a
fire
in
the
stove
there
said
lapham
passing
out
half
an
hour
later
his
wife
came
into
the
outer
office
she
had
passed
the
day
in
a
passion
of
gradually
mounting
from
the
mental
numbness
in
which
he
had
left
her
and
now
she
could
wait
no
longer
to
tell
him
that
she
saw
how
she
had
forsaken
him
in
his
hour
of
trial
and
left
him
to
bear
it
alone
she
wondered
at
herself
in
shame
and
dismay
she
wondered
that
she
could
have
been
so
confused
as
to
the
real
point
by
that
old
wretch
of
a
rogers
that
she
could
have
let
him
hoodwink
her
so
even
for
a
moment
it
astounded
her
that
such
a
thing
should
have
happened
for
if
there
was
any
virtue
upon
which
this
good
woman
prided
herself
in
which
she
thought
herself
superior
to
her
husband
it
was
her
instant
and
steadfast
perception
of
right
and
wrong
and
the
ability
to
choose
the
right
to
her
own
hurt
but
she
had
now
to
confess
as
each
of
us
has
had
likewise
to
confess
in
his
own
case
that
the
very
virtue
on
which
she
had
prided
herself
was
the
thing
that
had
played
her
false
that
she
had
kept
her
mind
so
long
upon
that
old
wrong
which
she
believed
her
husband
had
done
this
man
that
she
could
not
detach
it
but
clung
to
the
thought
of
reparation
for
it
when
she
ought
to
have
seen
that
he
was
proposing
a
piece
of
roguery
as
the
means
the
suffering
which
lapham
must
inflict
on
him
if
he
decided
against
him
had
been
more
to
her
apprehension
than
the
harm
he
might
do
if
he
decided
for
him
but
now
she
owned
her
limitations
to
herself
and
above
everything
in
the
world
she
wished
the
man
whom
her
conscience
had
roused
and
driven
on
whither
her
intelligence
had
not
followed
to
do
right
to
do
what
he
felt
to
be
right
and
nothing
else
she
admired
and
revered
him
for
going
beyond
her
and
she
wished
to
tell
him
that
she
did
not
know
what
he
had
determined
to
do
about
rogers
but
that
she
knew
it
was
right
and
would
gladly
abide
the
consequences
with
him
whatever
they
were
she
had
not
been
near
his
place
of
business
for
nearly
a
year
and
her
heart
smote
her
tenderly
as
she
looked
about
her
there
and
thought
of
the
early
days
when
she
knew
as
much
about
the
paint
as
he
did
she
wished
that
those
days
were
back
again
she
saw
corey
at
his
desk
and
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
to
him
she
dropped
her
veil
that
she
need
not
recognise
him
and
pushed
on
to
lapham
room
and
opening
the
door
without
knocking
shut
it
behind
her
then
she
became
aware
with
intolerable
disappointment
that
her
husband
was
not
there
instead
a
very
pretty
girl
sat
at
his
desk
operating
a
typewriter
she
seemed
quite
at
home
and
she
paid
lapham
the
scant
attention
which
such
young
women
often
bestow
upon
people
not
personally
interesting
to
them
it
vexed
the
wife
that
any
one
else
should
seem
to
be
helping
her
husband
about
business
that
she
had
once
been
so
intimate
with
and
she
did
not
at
all
like
the
indifference
to
her
presence
her
hat
and
sack
hung
on
a
nail
in
one
corner
and
lapham
office
coat
looking
intensely
like
him
to
his
wife
familiar
eye
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
other
corner
and
lapham
liked
even
less
than
the
girl
good
looks
this
domestication
of
her
garments
in
her
husband
office
she
began
to
ask
herself
excitedly
why
he
should
be
away
from
his
office
when
she
happened
to
come
and
she
had
not
the
strength
at
the
moment
to
reason
herself
out
of
her
unreasonableness
when
will
colonel
lapham
be
in
do
you
suppose
she
sharply
asked
of
the
girl
i
could
say
exactly
replied
the
girl
without
looking
round
has
he
been
out
long
i
do
know
as
i
noticed
said
the
girl
looking
up
at
the
clock
without
looking
at
lapham
she
went
on
working
her
machine
well
i
ca
wait
any
longer
said
the
wife
abruptly
when
colonel
lapham
comes
in
you
please
tell
him
lapham
wants
to
see
him
the
girl
started
to
her
feet
and
turned
toward
lapham
with
a
red
and
startled
face
which
she
did
not
lift
to
confront
her
yes
yes
i
will
she
faltered
the
wife
went
home
with
a
sense
of
defeat
mixed
with
an
irritation
about
this
girl
which
she
could
not
quell
or
account
for
she
found
her
husband
message
and
it
seemed
intolerable
that
he
should
have
gone
to
new
york
without
seeing
her
she
asked
herself
in
vain
what
the
mysterious
business
could
be
that
took
him
away
so
suddenly
she
said
to
herself
that
he
was
neglecting
her
he
was
leaving
her
out
a
little
too
much
and
in
demanding
of
herself
why
he
had
never
mentioned
that
girl
there
in
his
office
she
forgot
how
much
she
had
left
herself
out
of
his
business
life
that
was
another
curse
of
their
prosperity
well
she
was
glad
the
prosperity
was
going
it
had
never
been
happiness
after
this
she
was
going
to
know
everything
as
she
used
she
tried
to
dismiss
the
whole
matter
till
lapham
returned
and
if
there
had
been
anything
for
her
to
do
in
that
miserable
house
as
she
called
it
in
her
thought
she
might
have
succeeded
but
again
the
curse
was
on
her
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
the
looks
of
that
girl
kept
coming
back
to
her
vacancy
her
disoccupation
she
tried
to
make
herself
something
to
do
but
that
beauty
which
she
had
not
liked
followed
her
amid
the
work
of
overhauling
the
summer
clothing
which
irene
had
seen
to
putting
away
in
the
fall
who
was
the
thing
anyway
it
was
very
strange
her
being
there
why
did
she
jump
up
in
that
frightened
way
when
lapham
had
named
herself
after
dark
that
evening
when
the
question
had
worn
away
its
poignancy
from
mere
iteration
a
note
for
lapham
was
left
at
the
door
by
a
messenger
who
said
there
was
no
answer
a
note
for
me
she
said
staring
at
the
unknown
and
somehow
handwriting
of
the
superscription
then
she
opened
it
and
read
ask
your
husband
about
his
lady
a
friend
and
who
signed
the
note
gave
no
other
name
lapham
sat
helpless
with
it
in
her
hand
her
brain
reeled
she
tried
to
fight
the
madness
off
but
before
lapham
came
back
the
second
morning
it
had
become
with
lessening
intervals
of
sanity
and
release
a
demoniacal
possession
she
passed
the
night
without
sleep
without
rest
in
the
frenzy
of
the
cruellest
of
the
passions
which
covers
with
shame
the
unhappy
soul
it
possesses
and
murderously
lusts
for
the
misery
of
its
object
if
she
had
known
where
to
find
her
husband
in
new
york
she
would
have
followed
him
she
waited
his
return
in
an
ecstasy
of
impatience
in
the
morning
he
came
back
looking
spent
and
haggard
she
saw
him
drive
up
to
the
door
and
she
ran
to
let
him
in
herself
who
is
that
girl
you
got
in
your
office
silas
lapham
she
demanded
when
her
husband
entered
girl
in
my
office
yes
who
is
she
what
is
she
doing
there
why
what
have
you
heard
about
her
never
you
mind
what
i
heard
who
is
she
is
it
that
you
gave
that
money
to
i
want
to
know
who
she
is
i
want
to
know
what
a
respectable
man
with
girls
of
his
own
is
doing
with
such
a
looking
thing
as
that
in
his
office
i
want
to
know
how
long
she
been
there
i
want
to
know
what
she
there
at
all
for
he
had
mechanically
pushed
her
before
him
into
the
long
darkened
parlour
and
he
shut
himself
in
there
with
her
now
to
keep
the
household
from
hearing
her
lifted
voice
for
a
while
he
stood
bewildered
and
could
not
have
answered
if
he
would
and
then
he
would
not
he
merely
asked
have
i
ever
accused
you
of
anything
wrong
persis
you
no
need
to
she
answered
furiously
placing
herself
against
the
closed
door
did
you
ever
know
me
to
do
anything
out
of
the
way
that
is
what
i
asked
you
well
i
guess
you
may
find
out
about
that
girl
yourself
get
away
from
the
door
i
wo
get
away
from
the
door
she
felt
herself
set
lightly
aside
and
her
husband
opened
the
door
and
went
out
i
will
find
out
about
her
she
screamed
after
him
find
out
and
i
disgrace
you
i
teach
you
how
to
treat
me
the
air
blackened
round
her
she
reeled
to
the
sofa
and
then
she
found
herself
waking
from
a
faint
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
lain
there
she
did
not
care
in
a
moment
her
madness
came
whirling
back
upon
her
she
rushed
up
to
his
room
it
was
empty
the
stood
ajar
and
the
drawers
were
open
he
must
have
packed
a
bag
hastily
and
fled
she
went
out
and
wandered
crazily
up
and
down
till
she
found
a
hack
she
gave
the
driver
her
husband
business
address
and
told
him
to
drive
there
as
fast
as
he
could
and
three
times
she
lowered
the
window
to
put
her
head
out
and
ask
him
if
he
could
not
hurry
a
thousand
things
thronged
into
her
mind
to
support
her
in
her
evil
will
she
remembered
how
glad
and
proud
that
man
had
been
to
marry
her
and
how
everybody
said
she
was
marrying
beneath
her
when
she
took
him
she
remembered
how
good
she
had
always
been
to
him
how
perfectly
devoted
slaving
early
and
late
to
advance
him
and
looking
out
for
his
interests
in
all
things
and
sparing
herself
in
nothing
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
he
might
have
been
driving
stage
yet
and
since
their
troubles
had
begun
the
troubles
which
his
own
folly
and
imprudence
had
brought
on
them
her
conduct
had
been
that
of
a
true
and
faithful
wife
was
he
the
sort
of
man
to
be
allowed
to
play
her
false
with
impunity
she
set
her
teeth
and
drew
her
breath
sharply
through
them
when
she
thought
how
willingly
she
had
let
him
befool
her
and
delude
her
about
that
memorandum
of
payments
to
because
she
loved
him
so
much
and
pitied
him
for
his
cares
and
anxieties
she
recalled
his
confusion
his
guilty
looks
she
plunged
out
of
the
carriage
so
hastily
when
she
reached
the
office
that
she
did
not
think
of
paying
the
driver
and
he
had
to
call
after
her
when
she
had
got
up
the
stairs
then
she
went
straight
to
lapham
room
with
outrage
in
her
heart
there
was
again
no
one
there
but
that
girl
she
jumped
to
her
feet
in
a
fright
as
lapham
dashed
the
door
to
behind
her
and
flung
up
her
veil
the
two
women
confronted
each
other
why
the
good
land
cried
lapham
ai
you
zerrilla
millon
i
i
married
faltered
the
girl
my
name
dewey
now
you
jim
millon
daughter
anyway
how
long
have
you
been
here
i
have
been
here
regularly
i
been
here
off
and
on
ever
since
last
may
where
your
mother
she
here
in
boston
lapham
kept
her
eyes
on
the
girl
but
she
dropped
trembling
into
her
husband
chair
and
a
sort
of
amaze
and
curiosity
were
in
her
voice
instead
of
the
fury
she
had
meant
to
put
there
the
colonel
continued
zerrilla
he
been
helping
us
and
he
got
me
a
so
that
i
can
help
myself
a
little
mother
doing
pretty
well
now
and
when
hen
is
around
we
can
get
along
that
your
husband
i
never
wanted
to
marry
him
but
he
promised
to
try
to
get
something
to
do
on
shore
and
mother
was
all
for
it
because
he
had
a
little
property
then
and
i
thought
may
be
i
better
but
it
turned
out
just
as
i
said
and
if
he
do
stay
away
long
enough
this
time
to
let
me
get
the
divorce
he
agreed
to
it
time
and
again
i
do
know
what
we
going
to
do
zerrilla
voice
fell
and
the
trouble
which
she
could
keep
out
of
her
face
usually
when
she
was
comfortably
warmed
and
fed
and
prettily
dressed
clouded
it
in
the
presence
of
a
sympathetic
listener
i
saw
it
was
you
when
you
came
in
the
other
day
she
went
on
but
you
did
seem
to
know
me
i
suppose
the
colonel
told
you
that
there
a
gentleman
going
to
marry
me
wemmel
his
name
as
soon
as
i
get
the
divorce
but
sometimes
completely
discouraged
it
do
seem
as
if
i
ever
could
get
it
lapham
would
not
let
her
know
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
attributed
to
her
knowledge
she
remained
listening
to
zerrilla
and
piecing
out
the
whole
history
of
her
presence
there
from
the
facts
of
the
past
and
the
traits
of
her
husband
character
one
of
the
things
she
had
always
had
to
fight
him
about
was
that
idea
of
his
that
he
was
bound
to
take
care
of
jim
millon
worthless
wife
and
her
child
because
millon
had
got
the
bullet
that
was
meant
for
him
it
was
a
perfect
superstition
of
his
she
could
not
beat
it
out
of
him
but
she
had
made
him
promise
the
last
time
he
had
done
anything
for
that
woman
that
it
should
be
the
last
time
he
had
then
got
her
a
little
house
in
one
of
the
fishing
ports
where
she
could
take
the
sailors
to
board
and
wash
for
and
earn
an
honest
living
if
she
would
keep
straight
that
was
five
or
six
years
ago
and
lapham
had
heard
nothing
of
millon
since
she
had
heard
quite
enough
of
her
before
and
had
known
her
idle
and
baddish
ever
since
she
was
the
worst
little
girl
at
school
in
lumberville
and
all
through
her
shameful
girlhood
and
the
married
days
which
she
had
made
so
miserable
to
the
poor
fellow
who
had
given
her
his
decent
name
and
a
chance
to
behave
herself
lapham
had
no
mercy
on
moll
millon
and
she
had
quarrelled
often
enough
with
her
husband
for
befriending
her
as
for
the
child
if
the
mother
would
put
zerrilla
out
with
some
respectable
family
that
would
be
one
thing
but
as
long
as
she
kept
zerrilla
with
her
she
was
against
letting
her
husband
do
anything
for
either
of
them
he
had
done
ten
times
as
much
for
them
now
as
he
had
any
need
to
and
she
had
made
him
give
her
his
solemn
word
that
he
would
do
no
more
she
saw
now
that
she
was
wrong
to
make
him
give
it
and
that
he
must
have
broken
it
again
and
again
for
the
reason
that
he
had
given
when
she
once
scolded
him
for
throwing
away
his
money
on
that
hussy
when
i
think
of
jim
millon
i
got
to
that
all
she
recalled
now
that
whenever
she
had
brought
up
the
subject
of
millon
and
her
daughter
he
had
seemed
shy
of
it
and
had
dropped
it
with
some
guess
that
they
were
getting
along
now
she
wondered
that
she
had
not
thought
at
once
of
millon
when
she
saw
that
memorandum
about
but
the
woman
had
passed
so
entirely
out
of
her
life
that
she
had
never
dreamt
of
her
in
connection
with
it
her
husband
had
deceived
her
yet
her
heart
was
no
longer
hot
against
him
but
rather
tenderly
grateful
that
his
deceit
was
in
this
sort
and
not
in
that
other
all
cruel
and
shameful
doubt
of
him
went
out
of
it
she
looked
at
this
beautiful
girl
who
had
blossomed
out
of
her
knowledge
since
she
saw
her
last
and
she
knew
that
she
was
only
a
blossomed
weed
of
the
same
worthless
root
as
her
mother
and
saved
if
saved
from
the
same
evil
destiny
by
the
good
of
her
father
in
her
but
so
far
as
the
girl
and
her
mother
were
concerned
lapham
knew
that
her
husband
was
to
blame
for
nothing
but
his
wilful
which
her
own
exactions
had
turned
into
deceit
she
remained
a
while
questioning
the
girl
quietly
about
herself
and
her
mother
and
then
with
a
better
mind
towards
zerrilla
at
least
than
she
had
ever
had
before
she
rose
up
and
went
out
there
must
have
been
some
outer
hint
of
the
exhaustion
in
which
the
subsidence
of
her
excitement
had
left
her
within
for
before
she
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
corey
came
towards
her
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
lapham
the
colonel
was
here
just
before
you
came
in
on
his
way
to
the
train
yes
yes
i
did
know
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
catch
him
here
but
it
do
matter
i
wish
you
would
let
some
one
go
with
me
to
get
a
carriage
she
begged
feebly
i
go
with
you
myself
said
the
young
fellow
ignoring
the
strangeness
in
her
manner
he
offered
her
his
arm
in
the
twilight
of
the
staircase
and
she
was
glad
to
put
her
trembling
hand
through
it
and
keep
it
there
till
he
helped
her
into
a
hack
which
he
found
for
her
he
gave
the
driver
her
direction
and
stood
looking
a
little
anxiously
at
her
i
thank
you
i
am
all
right
now
she
said
and
he
bade
the
man
drive
on
when
she
reached
home
she
went
to
bed
spent
with
the
tumult
of
her
emotions
and
sick
with
shame
and
she
understood
now
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
told
her
in
as
many
words
that
if
he
had
befriended
those
worthless
jades
the
millons
characterised
themselves
so
even
to
lapham
remorse
secretly
and
in
defiance
of
her
it
was
because
he
dreaded
her
blame
which
was
so
sharp
and
bitter
for
what
he
could
not
help
doing
it
consoled
her
that
he
had
defied
her
deceived
her
when
he
came
back
she
should
tell
him
that
and
then
it
flashed
upon
her
that
she
did
not
know
where
he
was
gone
or
whether
he
would
ever
come
again
if
he
never
came
it
would
be
no
more
than
she
deserved
but
she
sent
for
penelope
and
tried
to
give
herself
hopes
of
escape
from
this
just
penalty
lapham
had
not
told
his
daughter
where
he
was
going
she
had
heard
him
packing
his
bag
and
had
offered
to
help
him
but
he
had
said
he
could
do
it
best
and
had
gone
off
as
he
usually
did
without
taking
leave
of
any
one
what
were
you
talking
about
so
loud
down
in
the
parlour
she
asked
her
mother
just
before
he
came
up
is
there
any
new
trouble
no
it
was
nothing
i
could
tell
once
i
thought
you
were
laughing
she
went
about
closing
the
curtains
on
account
of
her
mother
headache
and
doing
awkwardly
and
imperfectly
the
things
that
irene
would
have
done
so
skilfully
for
her
comfort
the
day
wore
away
to
nightfall
and
then
lapham
said
she
must
know
penelope
said
there
was
no
one
to
ask
the
clerks
would
all
be
gone
home
and
her
mother
said
yes
there
was
corey
they
could
send
and
ask
him
he
would
know
the
girl
hesitated
very
well
she
said
then
scarcely
above
a
whisper
and
she
presently
laughed
huskily
corey
seems
fated
to
come
in
somewhere
i
guess
it
a
providence
mother
she
sent
off
a
note
inquiring
whether
he
could
tell
her
just
where
her
father
had
expected
to
be
that
night
and
the
answer
came
quickly
back
that
corey
did
not
know
but
would
look
up
the
and
inquire
this
office
brought
him
in
person
an
hour
later
to
tell
penelope
that
the
colonel
was
to
be
at
lapham
that
night
and
next
day
he
came
in
from
new
york
in
a
great
hurry
and
rushed
off
as
soon
as
he
could
pack
his
bag
penelope
explained
and
we
had
a
chance
to
ask
him
where
he
was
to
be
and
mother
was
very
well
and
i
thought
she
was
looking
well
when
she
was
at
the
office
and
so
i
thought
i
would
come
rather
than
send
corey
explained
in
his
turn
oh
thank
you
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
telegraph
colonel
lapham
or
anything
oh
no
thank
you
mother
better
now
she
merely
wanted
to
be
sure
where
he
was
he
did
not
offer
to
go
upon
this
conclusion
of
his
business
but
hoped
he
was
not
keeping
her
from
her
mother
she
thanked
him
once
again
and
said
no
that
her
mother
was
much
better
since
she
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
without
any
apparent
exchange
of
intelligence
he
remained
and
at
eleven
he
was
still
there
he
was
honest
in
saying
he
did
not
know
it
was
so
late
but
he
made
no
pretence
of
being
sorry
and
she
took
the
blame
to
herself
i
ought
to
have
let
you
stay
she
said
but
with
father
gone
and
all
that
trouble
hanging
over
us
she
was
allowing
him
to
hold
her
hand
a
moment
at
the
door
to
which
she
had
followed
him
i
so
glad
you
could
let
me
he
said
and
i
want
to
ask
you
now
when
i
may
come
again
but
if
you
need
me
you
a
sharp
pull
at
the
outside
made
them
start
asunder
and
at
a
sign
from
penelope
who
knew
that
the
maids
were
abed
by
this
time
he
opened
it
why
irene
shrieked
the
girl
irene
entered
with
the
hackman
who
had
driven
her
unheard
to
the
door
following
with
her
small
bags
and
kissed
her
sister
with
resolute
composure
that
all
she
said
to
the
hackman
i
gave
my
checks
to
the
expressman
she
explained
to
penelope
corey
stood
helpless
irene
turned
upon
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
how
do
you
do
mr
corey
she
said
with
a
courage
that
sent
a
thrill
of
admiring
gratitude
through
him
where
mamma
pen
papa
gone
to
bed
penelope
faltered
out
some
reply
embodying
the
facts
and
irene
ran
up
the
stairs
to
her
mother
room
lapham
started
up
in
bed
at
her
apparition
irene
lapham
uncle
william
thought
he
ought
to
tell
me
the
trouble
papa
was
in
and
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
stay
off
there
junketing
while
you
were
going
through
all
this
at
home
and
pen
acting
so
silly
too
you
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
to
let
me
stay
so
long
i
started
just
as
soon
as
i
could
pack
did
you
get
my
despatch
i
telegraphed
from
springfield
but
it
do
matter
now
here
i
am
and
i
do
think
i
need
have
hurried
on
pen
account
she
added
with
an
accent
prophetic
of
the
sort
of
old
maid
she
would
become
if
she
happened
not
to
marry
did
you
see
him
asked
her
mother
it
the
first
time
he
been
here
since
she
told
him
he
must
come
i
guess
it
is
the
last
time
by
the
looks
said
irene
and
before
she
took
off
her
bonnet
she
began
to
undo
some
of
penelope
mistaken
arrangements
of
the
room
at
breakfast
where
corey
and
his
mother
met
the
next
morning
before
his
father
and
sisters
came
down
he
told
her
with
embarrassment
which
told
much
more
that
he
wished
now
that
she
would
go
and
call
upon
the
laphams
corey
turned
a
little
pale
but
shut
her
lips
tight
and
mourned
in
silence
whatever
hopes
she
had
lately
permitted
herself
she
answered
with
roman
fortitude
of
course
if
there
anything
between
you
and
miss
lapham
your
family
ought
to
recognise
it
yes
said
corey
you
were
reluctant
to
have
me
call
at
first
but
now
if
the
affair
is
going
on
it
is
i
hope
yes
it
is
then
i
ought
to
go
and
see
her
with
your
sisters
and
she
ought
to
come
here
and
we
ought
all
to
see
her
and
make
the
matter
public
we
ca
do
so
too
soon
it
will
seem
as
if
we
were
ashamed
if
we
do
yes
you
are
quite
right
mother
said
the
young
man
gratefully
and
i
feel
how
kind
and
good
you
are
i
have
tried
to
consider
you
in
this
matter
though
i
do
seem
to
have
done
so
i
know
what
your
rights
are
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
were
meeting
even
your
tastes
perfectly
but
i
know
you
will
like
her
when
you
come
to
know
her
it
been
very
hard
for
her
every
way
about
her
sister
and
made
a
great
sacrifice
for
me
she
acted
nobly
corey
whose
thoughts
can
not
always
be
reported
said
she
was
sure
of
it
and
that
all
she
desired
was
her
son
happiness
she
been
very
unwilling
to
consider
it
an
engagement
on
that
account
and
on
account
of
colonel
lapham
difficulties
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
now
for
that
very
reason
i
do
know
just
how
serious
the
trouble
is
but
it
is
a
time
when
we
can
seem
indifferent
the
logic
of
this
was
not
perhaps
so
apparent
to
the
glasses
of
fifty
as
to
the
eyes
of
but
corey
however
she
viewed
it
could
not
allow
herself
to
blench
before
the
son
whom
she
had
taught
that
to
want
magnanimity
was
to
be
less
than
gentlemanly
she
answered
with
what
composure
she
could
i
will
take
your
sisters
and
then
she
made
some
natural
inquiries
about
lapham
affairs
oh
i
hope
it
will
come
out
all
right
corey
said
with
a
lover
vague
smile
and
left
her
when
his
father
came
down
rubbing
his
long
hands
together
and
looking
aloof
from
all
the
cares
of
the
practical
world
in
an
artistic
withdrawal
from
which
his
eye
ranged
over
the
before
he
sat
down
corey
told
him
what
she
and
their
son
had
been
saying
he
laughed
with
a
delicate
impersonal
appreciation
of
the
predicament
well
anna
you
ca
say
but
if
you
ever
were
guilty
of
supposing
yourself
porcelain
this
is
a
just
punishment
of
your
arrogance
here
you
are
bound
by
the
very
quality
on
which
you
prided
yourself
to
behave
well
to
a
bit
of
earthenware
who
is
apparently
in
danger
of
losing
the
gilding
that
rendered
her
tolerable
we
never
cared
for
the
money
said
corey
you
know
that
no
and
now
we
ca
seem
to
care
for
the
loss
of
it
that
would
be
still
worse
either
horn
of
the
dilemma
gores
us
well
we
still
have
the
comfort
we
had
in
the
beginning
we
ca
help
ourselves
and
we
should
only
make
bad
worse
by
trying
unless
we
can
look
to
inamorata
herself
for
help
corey
shook
her
head
so
gloomily
that
her
husband
broke
off
with
another
laugh
but
at
the
continued
trouble
of
her
face
he
said
sympathetically
my
dear
i
know
it
a
very
disagreeable
affair
and
i
do
think
either
of
us
has
failed
to
see
that
it
was
so
from
the
beginning
i
have
had
my
way
of
expressing
my
sense
of
it
and
you
yours
but
we
have
always
been
of
the
same
mind
about
it
we
would
both
have
preferred
to
have
tom
marry
in
his
own
set
the
laphams
are
about
the
last
set
we
could
have
wished
him
to
marry
into
they
are
uncultivated
people
and
so
far
as
i
have
seen
them
i
not
able
to
believe
that
poverty
will
improve
them
still
it
may
let
us
hope
for
the
best
and
let
us
behave
as
well
as
we
know
how
i
sure
you
will
behave
well
and
i
shall
try
i
going
with
you
to
call
on
miss
lapham
this
is
a
thing
that
ca
be
done
by
halves
he
cut
his
orange
in
the
neapolitan
manner
and
ate
it
in
quarters
xxvii
irene
did
not
leave
her
mother
in
any
illusion
concerning
her
cousin
will
and
herself
she
said
they
had
all
been
as
nice
to
her
as
they
could
be
and
when
lapham
hinted
at
what
had
been
in
her
thoughts
or
her
hopes
rather
irene
severely
snubbed
the
notion
she
said
that
he
was
as
good
as
engaged
to
a
girl
out
there
and
that
he
had
never
dreamt
of
her
her
mother
wondered
at
her
severity
in
these
few
months
the
girl
had
toughened
and
hardened
she
had
lost
all
her
babyish
dependence
and
pliability
she
was
like
iron
and
here
and
there
she
was
sharpened
to
a
cutting
edge
it
had
been
a
life
and
death
struggle
with
her
she
had
conquered
but
she
had
also
necessarily
lost
much
perhaps
what
she
had
lost
was
not
worth
keeping
but
at
any
rate
she
had
lost
it
she
required
from
her
mother
a
strict
and
accurate
account
of
her
father
affairs
so
far
as
mrs
lapham
knew
them
and
she
showed
a
quickness
in
comprehending
them
that
penelope
had
never
pretended
to
with
her
sister
she
ignored
the
past
as
completely
as
it
was
possible
to
do
and
she
treated
both
corey
and
penelope
with
the
justice
which
their
innocence
of
voluntary
offence
deserved
it
was
a
difficult
part
and
she
kept
away
from
them
as
much
as
she
could
she
had
been
easily
excused
on
a
plea
of
fatigue
from
her
journey
when
and
corey
had
called
the
day
after
her
arrival
and
lapham
being
still
unwell
penelope
received
them
alone
the
girl
had
instinctively
judged
best
that
they
should
know
the
worst
at
once
and
she
let
them
have
the
full
brunt
of
the
while
she
was
screwing
her
courage
up
to
come
down
and
see
them
she
was
afterwards
months
afterwards
able
to
report
to
corey
that
when
she
entered
the
room
his
father
was
sitting
with
his
hat
on
his
knees
a
little
tilted
away
from
the
emancipation
group
as
if
he
expected
the
lincoln
to
hit
him
with
that
lifted
hand
of
benediction
and
that
corey
looked
as
if
she
were
not
sure
but
the
eagle
pecked
but
for
the
time
being
penelope
was
as
nearly
crazed
as
might
be
by
the
complications
of
her
position
and
received
her
visitors
with
a
piteous
distraction
which
could
not
fail
of
touching
bromfield
italianised
sympatheticism
he
was
very
polite
and
tender
with
her
at
first
and
ended
by
making
a
joke
with
her
to
which
penelope
responded
in
her
sort
he
said
he
hoped
they
parted
friends
if
not
quite
acquaintances
and
she
said
she
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
recognise
each
other
if
they
ever
met
again
that
is
what
i
meant
by
her
pertness
said
mrs
corey
when
they
were
driving
away
was
it
very
pert
he
queried
the
child
had
to
answer
something
i
would
much
rather
she
had
answered
nothing
under
the
circumstances
said
corey
however
she
added
hopelessly
oh
she
a
merry
little
grig
you
can
see
that
and
there
no
harm
in
her
i
can
understand
a
little
why
a
formal
fellow
like
tom
should
be
taken
with
her
she
has
the
least
reverence
i
suppose
and
joked
with
the
young
man
from
the
beginning
you
must
remember
anna
that
there
was
a
time
when
you
liked
my
joking
it
was
a
very
different
thing
but
that
pursued
corey
really
i
do
see
how
tom
stands
that
anna
a
terrible
thought
occurs
to
me
fancy
tom
being
married
in
front
of
that
group
with
a
floral
in
tuberoses
coming
down
on
either
side
of
it
bromfield
cried
his
wife
you
are
unmerciful
no
no
my
dear
he
argued
merely
imaginative
and
i
can
even
imagine
that
little
thing
finding
tom
just
the
least
bit
slow
at
times
if
it
were
not
for
his
goodness
tom
is
so
kind
that
convinced
he
sometimes
feels
your
joke
in
his
heart
when
his
head
quite
clear
about
it
well
we
will
not
despond
my
dear
your
father
seemed
actually
to
like
her
corey
reported
to
her
daughters
very
much
shaken
in
her
own
prejudices
by
the
fact
if
the
girl
were
not
so
offensive
to
his
fastidiousness
there
might
be
some
hope
that
she
was
not
so
offensive
as
corey
had
thought
i
wonder
how
she
will
strike
you
she
concluded
looking
from
one
daughter
to
another
as
if
trying
to
decide
which
of
them
would
like
penelope
least
irene
return
and
the
visit
of
the
coreys
formed
a
distraction
for
the
laphams
in
which
their
impending
troubles
seemed
to
hang
further
aloof
but
it
was
only
one
of
those
reliefs
which
mark
the
course
of
adversity
and
it
was
not
one
of
the
cheerful
reliefs
at
any
other
time
either
incident
would
have
been
an
anxiety
and
care
for
lapham
which
she
would
have
found
hard
to
bear
but
now
she
almost
welcomed
them
at
the
end
of
three
days
lapham
returned
and
his
wife
met
him
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
marked
their
parting
she
reserved
her
atonement
for
a
fitter
time
he
would
know
now
from
the
way
she
acted
that
she
felt
all
right
towards
him
he
took
very
little
note
of
her
manner
but
met
his
family
with
an
austere
quiet
that
puzzled
her
and
a
sort
of
pensive
dignity
that
refined
his
rudeness
to
an
effect
that
sometimes
comes
to
such
natures
after
long
sickness
when
the
animal
strength
has
been
taxed
and
lowered
he
sat
silent
with
her
at
the
table
after
their
girls
had
left
them
alone
and
seeing
that
he
did
not
mean
to
speak
she
began
to
explain
why
irene
had
come
home
and
to
praise
her
yes
she
done
right
said
lapham
it
was
time
for
her
to
come
he
added
gently
then
he
was
silent
again
and
his
wife
told
him
of
corey
having
been
there
and
of
his
father
and
mother
calling
i
guess
concluded
to
make
it
up
she
said
well
we
see
about
that
said
lapham
and
now
she
could
no
longer
forbear
to
ask
him
about
his
affairs
i
do
know
as
i
got
any
right
to
know
anything
about
it
she
said
humbly
with
remote
allusion
to
her
treatment
of
him
but
i
ca
help
wanting
to
know
how
are
things
going
si
bad
he
said
pushing
his
plate
from
him
and
tilting
himself
back
in
his
chair
or
they
ai
going
at
all
they
stopped
what
do
you
mean
si
she
persisted
tenderly
i
got
to
the
end
of
my
string
i
shall
call
a
meeting
of
my
creditors
and
put
myself
in
their
hands
if
there
enough
left
to
satisfy
them
i
satisfied
his
voice
dropped
in
his
throat
he
swallowed
once
or
twice
and
then
did
not
speak
do
you
mean
that
it
all
over
with
you
she
asked
fearfully
he
bowed
his
big
head
wrinkled
and
grizzled
and
after
awhile
he
said
it
hard
to
realise
it
but
i
guess
there
ai
any
doubt
about
it
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
he
explained
to
her
about
the
west
virginia
people
and
how
he
had
got
an
extension
of
the
first
time
they
had
given
him
and
had
got
a
man
to
go
up
to
lapham
with
him
and
look
at
the
works
a
man
that
had
turned
up
in
new
york
and
wanted
to
put
money
in
the
business
his
money
would
have
enabled
lapham
to
close
with
the
west
virginians
the
devil
was
in
it
right
straight
along
said
lapham
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
keep
quiet
about
that
other
company
it
was
rogers
and
his
property
right
over
again
he
liked
the
look
of
things
and
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
business
and
he
had
the
money
plenty
it
would
have
saved
me
with
those
west
virginia
folks
but
i
had
to
tell
him
how
i
stood
i
had
to
tell
him
all
about
it
and
what
i
wanted
to
do
he
began
to
back
water
in
a
minute
and
the
next
morning
i
saw
that
it
was
up
with
him
he
gone
back
to
new
york
i
lost
my
last
chance
now
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
save
the
pieces
will
will
everything
go
she
asked
i
ca
tell
yet
but
they
shall
have
a
chance
at
everything
every
dollar
every
cent
i
sorry
for
you
persis
and
the
girls
oh
do
talk
of
us
she
was
trying
to
realise
that
the
simple
rude
soul
to
which
her
heart
clove
in
her
youth
but
which
she
had
put
to
such
cruel
proof
with
her
unsparing
conscience
and
her
unsparing
tongue
had
been
equal
to
its
ordeals
and
had
come
out
unscathed
and
unstained
he
was
able
in
his
talk
to
make
so
little
of
them
he
hardly
seemed
to
see
what
they
were
he
was
apparently
not
proud
of
them
and
certainly
not
glad
if
they
were
victories
of
any
sort
he
bore
them
with
the
patience
of
defeat
his
wife
wished
to
praise
him
but
she
did
not
know
how
so
she
offered
him
a
little
reproach
in
which
alone
she
touched
the
cause
of
her
behaviour
at
parting
silas
she
asked
after
a
long
gaze
at
him
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
jim
millon
girl
there
i
did
suppose
you
like
it
persis
he
answered
i
did
intend
to
tell
you
at
first
but
then
i
put
i
put
it
off
i
thought
come
round
some
day
and
find
it
out
for
yourself
i
punished
said
his
wife
for
not
taking
enough
interest
in
your
business
to
even
come
near
it
if
we
brought
back
to
the
day
of
small
things
i
guess
it
a
lesson
for
me
silas
oh
i
do
know
about
the
lesson
he
said
wearily
that
night
she
showed
him
the
anonymous
scrawl
which
had
kindled
her
fury
against
him
he
turned
it
listlessly
over
in
his
hand
i
guess
i
know
who
it
from
he
said
giving
it
back
to
her
and
i
guess
you
do
too
persis
but
how
how
could
he
mebbe
he
believed
it
said
lapham
with
patience
that
cut
her
more
keenly
than
any
reproach
you
did
perhaps
because
the
process
of
his
ruin
had
been
so
gradual
perhaps
because
the
excitement
of
preceding
events
had
exhausted
their
capacity
for
emotion
the
actual
consummation
of
his
bankruptcy
brought
a
relief
a
repose
to
lapham
and
his
family
rather
than
a
fresh
sensation
of
calamity
in
the
shadow
of
his
disaster
they
returned
to
something
like
their
old
united
life
they
were
at
least
all
together
again
and
it
will
be
intelligible
to
those
whom
life
has
blessed
with
vicissitude
that
lapham
should
come
home
the
evening
after
he
had
given
up
everything
to
his
creditors
and
should
sit
down
to
his
supper
so
cheerful
that
penelope
could
joke
him
in
the
old
way
and
tell
him
that
she
thought
from
his
looks
they
had
concluded
to
pay
him
a
hundred
cents
on
every
dollar
he
owed
them
as
james
bellingham
had
taken
so
much
interest
in
his
troubles
from
the
first
lapham
thought
he
ought
to
tell
him
before
taking
the
final
step
just
how
things
stood
with
him
and
what
he
meant
to
do
bellingham
made
some
futile
inquiries
about
his
negotiations
with
the
west
virginians
and
lapham
told
him
they
had
come
to
nothing
he
spoke
of
the
new
york
man
and
the
chance
that
he
might
have
sold
out
half
his
business
to
him
but
of
course
i
had
to
let
him
know
how
it
was
about
those
fellows
of
course
said
bellingham
not
seeing
till
afterwards
the
full
significance
of
lapham
action
lapham
said
nothing
about
rogers
and
the
englishmen
he
believed
that
he
had
acted
right
in
that
matter
and
he
was
satisfied
but
he
did
not
care
to
have
bellingham
or
anybody
perhaps
think
he
had
been
a
fool
all
those
who
were
concerned
in
his
affairs
said
he
behaved
well
and
even
more
than
well
when
it
came
to
the
worst
the
prudence
the
good
sense
which
he
had
shown
in
the
first
years
of
his
success
and
of
which
his
great
prosperity
seemed
to
have
bereft
him
came
back
and
these
qualities
used
in
his
own
behalf
commended
him
as
much
to
his
creditors
as
the
anxiety
he
showed
that
no
one
should
suffer
by
him
this
even
made
some
of
them
doubtful
of
his
sincerity
they
gave
him
time
and
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
in
his
resuming
on
the
old
basis
if
the
ground
had
not
been
cut
from
under
him
by
the
competition
of
the
west
virginia
company
he
saw
himself
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
go
on
in
the
old
way
and
he
preferred
to
go
back
and
begin
the
world
anew
where
he
had
first
begun
it
in
the
hills
at
lapham
he
put
the
house
at
nankeen
square
with
everything
else
he
had
into
the
payment
of
his
debts
and
lapham
found
it
easier
to
leave
it
for
the
old
farmstead
in
vermont
than
it
would
have
been
to
go
from
that
home
of
many
years
to
the
new
house
on
the
water
side
of
beacon
this
thing
and
that
is
embittered
to
us
so
that
we
may
be
willing
to
relinquish
it
the
world
life
itself
is
embittered
to
most
of
us
so
that
we
are
glad
to
have
done
with
them
at
last
and
this
home
was
haunted
with
such
memories
to
each
of
those
who
abandoned
it
that
to
go
was
less
exile
than
escape
lapham
could
not
look
into
room
without
seeing
the
girl
there
before
her
glass
tearing
the
poor
little
of
her
hapless
fancy
from
their
to
take
them
and
fling
them
in
passionate
renunciation
upon
her
sister
she
could
not
come
into
the
where
her
little
ones
had
grown
up
without
starting
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
sitting
so
many
weary
nights
at
his
desk
there
trying
to
fight
his
way
back
to
hope
out
of
the
ruin
into
which
he
was
slipping
when
she
remembered
that
night
when
rogers
came
she
hated
the
place
irene
accepted
her
release
from
the
house
eagerly
and
was
glad
to
go
before
and
prepare
for
the
family
at
lapham
penelope
was
always
ashamed
of
her
engagement
there
it
must
seem
better
somewhere
else
and
she
was
glad
to
go
too
no
one
but
lapham
in
fact
felt
the
pang
of
parting
in
all
its
keenness
whatever
regret
the
others
had
was
softened
to
them
by
the
likeness
of
their
flitting
to
many
of
those
removals
for
the
summer
which
they
made
in
the
late
spring
when
they
left
nankeen
square
they
were
going
directly
into
the
country
instead
of
to
the
seaside
first
but
lapham
who
usually
remained
in
town
long
after
they
had
gone
knew
all
the
difference
for
his
nerves
there
was
no
mechanical
sense
of
coming
back
this
was
as
much
the
end
of
his
proud
prosperous
life
as
death
itself
could
have
been
he
was
returning
to
begin
life
anew
but
he
knew
as
well
as
he
knew
that
he
should
not
find
his
vanished
youth
in
his
native
hills
that
it
could
never
again
be
the
triumph
that
it
had
been
that
was
impossible
not
only
in
his
stiffened
and
weakened
forces
but
in
the
very
nature
of
things
he
was
going
back
by
grace
of
the
man
whom
he
owed
money
to
make
what
he
could
out
of
the
one
chance
which
his
successful
rivals
had
left
him
in
one
phase
his
paint
had
held
its
own
against
bad
times
and
ruinous
competition
and
it
was
with
the
hope
of
doing
still
more
with
the
persis
brand
that
he
now
set
himself
to
work
the
west
virginia
people
confessed
that
they
could
not
produce
those
fine
grades
and
they
willingly
left
the
field
to
him
a
strange
not
ignoble
friendliness
existed
between
lapham
and
the
three
brothers
they
had
used
him
fairly
it
was
their
facilities
that
had
conquered
him
not
their
and
he
recognised
in
them
without
enmity
the
necessity
to
which
he
had
yielded
if
he
succeeded
in
his
efforts
to
develop
his
paint
in
this
direction
it
must
be
for
a
long
time
on
a
small
scale
compared
with
his
former
business
which
it
could
never
equal
and
he
brought
to
them
the
flagging
energies
of
an
elderly
man
he
was
more
broken
than
he
knew
by
his
failure
it
did
not
kill
as
it
often
does
but
it
weakened
the
spring
once
so
strong
and
elastic
he
lapsed
more
and
more
into
acquiescence
with
his
changed
condition
and
that
bragging
note
of
his
was
rarely
sounded
he
worked
faithfully
enough
in
his
enterprise
but
sometimes
he
failed
to
seize
occasions
that
in
his
younger
days
he
would
have
turned
to
golden
account
his
wife
saw
in
him
a
daunted
look
that
made
her
heart
ache
for
him
one
result
of
his
friendly
relations
with
the
west
virginia
people
was
that
corey
went
in
with
them
and
the
fact
that
he
did
so
solely
upon
lapham
advice
and
by
means
of
his
recommendation
was
perhaps
the
colonel
proudest
consolation
corey
knew
the
business
thoroughly
and
after
half
a
year
at
kanawha
falls
and
in
the
office
at
new
york
he
went
out
to
mexico
and
central
america
to
see
what
could
be
done
for
them
upon
the
ground
which
he
had
theoretically
studied
with
lapham
before
he
went
he
came
up
to
vermont
and
urged
penelope
to
go
with
him
he
was
to
be
first
in
the
city
of
mexico
and
if
his
mission
was
successful
he
was
to
be
kept
there
and
in
south
america
several
years
watching
the
new
railroad
enterprises
and
the
development
of
mechanical
agriculture
and
whatever
other
undertakings
offered
an
opening
for
the
introduction
of
the
paint
they
were
all
young
men
together
and
corey
who
had
put
his
money
into
the
company
had
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
success
which
they
were
eager
to
achieve
there
no
more
reason
now
and
no
less
than
ever
there
was
mused
penelope
in
counsel
with
her
mother
why
i
should
say
yes
or
why
i
should
say
no
everything
else
changes
but
this
is
just
where
it
was
a
year
ago
it
do
go
backward
and
it
do
go
forward
mother
i
believe
i
shall
take
the
bit
in
my
teeth
if
anybody
will
put
it
there
it
is
the
same
as
it
was
suggested
her
mother
you
can
see
that
irene
all
over
it
that
no
credit
to
me
said
penelope
i
ought
to
be
just
as
much
ashamed
as
ever
you
no
need
ever
to
be
ashamed
that
true
too
said
the
girl
and
i
can
sneak
off
to
mexico
with
a
good
conscience
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
it
she
laughed
well
if
i
could
be
sentenced
to
be
married
or
somebody
would
up
and
forbid
the
banns
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
her
mother
left
her
to
carry
her
hesitation
back
to
corey
and
she
said
now
they
had
better
go
all
over
it
and
try
to
reason
it
out
and
i
hope
that
whatever
i
do
it
wo
be
for
my
own
sake
but
for
others
corey
said
he
was
sure
of
that
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
patient
tenderness
i
do
say
it
is
wrong
she
proceeded
rather
aimlessly
but
i
ca
make
it
seem
right
i
do
know
whether
i
can
make
you
understand
but
the
idea
of
being
happy
when
everybody
else
is
so
miserable
is
more
than
i
can
endure
it
makes
me
wretched
then
perhaps
that
your
share
of
the
common
suffering
suggested
corey
smiling
oh
you
know
it
is
you
know
it
nothing
oh
one
of
the
reasons
is
what
i
told
you
once
before
that
as
long
as
father
is
in
trouble
i
ca
let
you
think
of
me
now
that
he
lost
everything
she
bent
her
eyes
inquiringly
upon
him
as
if
for
the
effect
of
this
argument
i
do
think
that
a
very
good
reason
he
answered
seriously
but
smiling
still
do
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
why
i
suppose
i
must
she
said
dropping
her
eyes
then
why
should
i
think
all
the
more
of
you
on
account
of
your
father
loss
you
did
suppose
i
cared
for
you
because
he
was
prosperous
there
was
a
shade
of
reproach
ever
so
delicate
and
gentle
in
his
smiling
question
which
she
felt
no
i
could
think
such
a
thing
of
you
i
i
do
know
what
i
meant
i
meant
that
she
could
not
go
on
and
say
that
she
had
felt
herself
more
worthy
of
him
because
of
her
father
money
it
would
not
have
been
true
yet
there
was
no
other
explanation
she
stopped
and
cast
a
helpless
glance
at
him
he
came
to
her
aid
i
understand
why
you
should
wish
me
to
suffer
by
your
father
misfortunes
yes
that
was
it
and
there
is
too
great
a
difference
every
way
we
ought
to
look
at
that
again
you
must
pretend
that
you
do
know
it
for
that
would
be
true
your
mother
will
never
like
me
and
perhaps
perhaps
i
shall
not
like
her
well
said
corey
a
little
daunted
you
wo
have
to
marry
my
family
ah
that
is
the
point
i
know
it
he
admitted
i
wo
pretend
that
i
do
see
what
you
mean
but
i
sure
that
all
the
differences
would
disappear
when
you
came
to
know
my
family
better
i
not
afraid
but
you
and
my
mother
will
like
each
other
she
ca
help
it
he
exclaimed
less
judicially
than
he
had
hitherto
spoken
and
he
went
on
to
urge
some
points
of
doubtful
tenability
we
have
our
ways
and
you
have
yours
and
while
i
do
say
but
what
you
and
my
mother
and
sisters
would
be
a
little
strange
together
at
first
it
would
soon
wear
off
on
both
sides
there
ca
be
anything
hopelessly
different
in
you
all
and
if
there
were
it
would
be
any
difference
to
me
do
you
think
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
you
on
my
side
against
your
mother
there
wo
be
any
sides
tell
me
just
what
it
is
you
afraid
of
afraid
thinking
of
then
i
do
know
it
is
anything
they
say
or
do
she
explained
with
her
eyes
intent
on
his
it
what
they
are
i
could
be
natural
with
them
and
if
i
ca
be
natural
with
people
i
disagreeable
can
you
be
natural
with
me
oh
i
not
afraid
of
you
i
never
was
that
was
the
trouble
from
the
beginning
well
then
that
all
that
necessary
and
it
never
was
the
least
trouble
to
me
it
made
me
untrue
to
irene
you
must
say
that
you
were
always
true
to
her
she
cared
for
you
first
well
but
i
never
cared
for
her
at
all
he
besought
her
she
thought
you
did
that
was
nobody
fault
and
i
ca
let
you
make
it
yours
my
dear
wait
we
must
understand
each
other
said
penelope
rising
from
her
seat
to
prevent
an
advance
he
was
making
from
his
i
want
you
to
realise
the
whole
affair
should
you
want
a
girl
who
had
a
cent
in
the
world
and
felt
different
in
your
mother
company
and
had
cheated
and
betrayed
her
own
sister
i
want
you
very
well
then
you
ca
have
me
i
should
always
despise
myself
i
ought
to
give
you
up
for
all
these
reasons
yes
i
must
she
looked
at
him
intently
and
there
was
a
tentative
quality
in
her
affirmations
is
this
your
answer
he
said
i
must
submit
if
i
asked
too
much
of
you
i
was
wrong
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
put
hers
in
it
you
think
capricious
and
fickle
she
said
i
ca
help
it
i
do
know
myself
i
ca
keep
to
one
thing
for
half
a
day
at
a
time
but
right
for
us
to
part
yes
it
must
be
it
must
be
she
repeated
and
i
shall
try
to
remember
that
i
will
try
to
keep
that
in
my
mind
and
you
will
too
you
wo
care
very
soon
i
did
mean
that
no
i
know
how
true
you
are
but
you
will
soon
look
at
me
differently
and
see
that
even
if
there
had
been
this
about
irene
i
was
not
the
one
for
you
you
do
think
so
do
you
she
pleaded
clinging
to
his
hand
i
am
not
at
all
what
they
would
like
your
family
i
felt
that
i
am
little
and
black
and
homely
and
they
do
understand
my
way
of
talking
and
now
that
we
lost
everything
no
i
not
fit
you
quite
right
not
to
have
patience
with
me
any
longer
i
tried
you
enough
i
ought
to
be
willing
to
marry
you
against
their
wishes
if
you
want
me
to
but
i
ca
make
the
sacrifice
i
too
selfish
for
that
all
at
once
she
flung
herself
on
his
breast
i
ca
even
give
you
up
i
shall
never
dare
look
any
one
in
the
face
again
go
go
but
take
me
with
you
i
tried
to
do
without
you
i
gave
it
a
fair
trial
and
it
was
a
dead
failure
o
poor
irene
how
could
she
give
you
up
corey
went
back
to
boston
immediately
and
left
penelope
as
he
must
to
tell
her
sister
that
they
were
to
be
married
she
was
spared
from
the
first
advance
toward
this
by
an
accident
or
a
misunderstanding
irene
came
straight
to
her
after
corey
was
gone
and
demanded
penelope
lapham
have
you
been
such
a
ninny
as
to
send
that
man
away
on
my
account
penelope
recoiled
from
this
terrible
courage
she
did
not
answer
directly
and
irene
went
on
because
if
you
did
i
thank
you
to
bring
him
back
again
i
not
going
to
have
him
thinking
that
dying
for
a
man
that
never
cared
for
me
it
insulting
and
i
not
going
to
stand
it
now
you
just
send
for
him
oh
i
will
gasped
penelope
and
then
she
added
shamed
out
of
her
prevarication
by
irene
haughty
magnanimity
i
have
that
is
he
coming
back
irene
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
whatever
thought
was
in
her
mind
said
fiercely
well
and
left
her
to
her
dismay
her
dismay
and
her
relief
for
they
both
knew
that
this
was
the
last
time
they
should
ever
speak
of
that
again
the
marriage
came
after
so
much
sorrow
and
trouble
and
the
fact
was
received
with
so
much
misgiving
for
the
past
and
future
that
it
brought
lapham
none
of
the
triumph
in
which
he
had
once
exulted
at
the
thought
of
an
alliance
with
the
coreys
adversity
had
so
far
been
his
friend
that
it
had
taken
from
him
all
hope
of
the
social
success
for
which
people
crawl
and
truckle
and
restored
him
through
failure
and
doubt
and
heartache
the
manhood
which
his
prosperity
had
so
nearly
stolen
from
him
neither
he
nor
his
wife
thought
now
that
their
daughter
was
marrying
a
corey
they
thought
only
that
she
was
giving
herself
to
the
man
who
loved
her
and
their
acquiescence
was
sobered
still
further
by
the
presence
of
irene
their
hearts
were
far
more
with
her
again
and
again
lapham
said
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
go
through
it
i
ca
make
it
seem
right
she
said
it
is
right
steadily
answered
the
colonel
yes
i
know
but
it
do
seem
so
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
traits
in
penelope
character
which
finally
reconciled
all
her
husband
family
and
endeared
her
to
them
these
things
continually
happen
in
novels
and
the
coreys
as
they
had
always
promised
themselves
to
do
made
the
best
and
not
the
worst
of
tom
marriage
they
were
people
who
could
value
lapham
behaviour
as
tom
reported
it
to
them
they
were
proud
of
him
and
bromfield
corey
who
found
a
delicate
aesthetic
pleasure
in
the
heroism
with
which
lapham
had
withstood
rogers
and
his
temptations
something
finely
dramatic
and
unconsciously
effective
wrote
him
a
letter
which
would
once
have
flattered
the
rough
soul
almost
to
ecstasy
though
now
he
affected
to
slight
it
in
showing
it
it
all
right
if
it
makes
it
more
comfortable
for
pen
he
said
to
his
wife
but
the
differences
remained
uneffaced
if
not
uneffaceable
between
the
coreys
and
tom
corey
wife
if
he
had
only
married
the
colonel
subtly
suggested
nanny
corey
there
was
a
brief
season
of
civility
and
forbearance
on
both
sides
when
he
brought
her
home
before
starting
for
mexico
and
her
made
a
sympathetic
feint
of
liking
penelope
way
of
talking
but
it
is
questionable
if
even
he
found
it
so
delightful
as
her
husband
did
lily
corey
made
a
little
ineffectual
sketch
of
her
which
she
put
by
with
other
studies
to
finish
up
sometime
and
found
her
rather
picturesque
in
some
ways
nanny
got
on
with
her
better
than
the
rest
and
saw
possibilities
for
her
in
the
country
to
which
she
was
going
as
she
quite
unformed
socially
she
explained
to
her
mother
there
is
a
chance
that
she
will
form
herself
on
the
spanish
manner
if
she
stays
there
long
enough
and
that
when
she
comes
back
she
will
have
the
charm
of
not
olives
perhaps
but
tortillas
whatever
they
are
something
strange
and
foreign
even
if
borrowed
i
glad
she
going
to
mexico
at
that
distance
we
can
correspond
her
mother
sighed
and
said
bravely
that
she
was
sure
they
all
got
on
very
pleasantly
as
it
was
and
that
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
if
tom
was
there
was
in
fact
much
truth
in
what
she
said
of
their
harmony
with
penelope
having
resolved
from
the
beginning
to
make
the
best
of
the
worst
it
might
almost
be
said
that
they
were
supported
and
consoled
in
their
good
intentions
by
a
higher
power
this
marriage
had
not
thanks
to
an
providence
brought
the
succession
of
lapham
teas
upon
bromfield
corey
which
he
had
dreaded
the
laphams
were
far
off
in
their
native
fastnesses
and
neither
lily
nor
nanny
corey
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
herself
to
the
conversation
of
irene
they
were
not
even
called
upon
to
make
a
social
demonstration
for
penelope
at
a
time
when
most
people
being
still
out
of
town
it
would
have
been
so
easy
she
and
tom
had
both
begged
that
there
might
be
nothing
of
that
kind
and
though
none
of
the
coreys
learned
to
know
her
very
well
in
the
week
she
spent
with
them
they
did
not
find
it
hard
to
get
on
with
her
there
were
even
moments
when
nanny
corey
like
her
father
had
glimpses
of
what
tom
had
called
her
humour
but
it
was
perhaps
too
unlike
their
own
to
be
easily
recognisable
whether
penelope
on
her
side
found
it
more
difficult
to
harmonise
i
can
not
say
she
had
much
more
of
the
harmonising
to
do
since
they
were
four
to
one
but
then
she
had
gone
through
so
much
greater
trials
before
when
the
door
of
their
carriage
closed
and
it
drove
off
with
her
and
her
husband
to
the
station
she
fetched
a
long
sigh
what
is
it
asked
corey
who
ought
to
have
known
better
oh
nothing
i
do
think
i
shall
feel
strange
amongst
the
mexicans
now
he
looked
at
her
with
a
puzzled
smile
which
grew
a
little
graver
and
then
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
this
made
her
cry
on
his
shoulder
i
only
meant
that
i
should
have
you
all
to
myself
there
is
no
proof
that
she
meant
more
but
it
is
certain
that
our
manners
and
customs
go
for
more
in
life
than
our
qualities
the
price
that
we
pay
for
civilisation
is
the
fine
yet
impassable
differentiation
of
these
perhaps
we
pay
too
much
but
it
will
not
be
possible
to
persuade
those
who
have
the
difference
in
their
favour
that
this
is
so
they
may
be
right
and
at
any
rate
the
blank
misgiving
the
recurring
sense
of
disappointment
to
which
the
young
departure
left
the
coreys
is
to
be
considered
that
was
the
end
of
their
son
and
brother
for
them
they
felt
that
and
they
were
not
mean
or
unamiable
people
he
remained
three
years
away
some
changes
took
place
in
that
time
one
of
these
was
the
purchase
by
the
kanawha
falls
company
of
the
mines
and
works
at
lapham
the
transfer
relieved
lapham
of
the
load
of
debt
which
he
was
still
labouring
under
and
gave
him
an
interest
in
the
vaster
enterprise
of
the
younger
men
which
he
had
once
vainly
hoped
to
grasp
all
in
his
own
hand
he
began
to
tell
of
this
coincidence
as
something
very
striking
and
pushing
on
more
actively
the
special
branch
of
the
business
left
to
him
he
bragged
quite
in
his
old
way
of
its
enormous
extension
his
he
said
was
pushing
it
in
mexico
and
central
america
an
idea
that
they
had
originally
had
in
common
well
young
blood
was
what
was
wanted
in
a
thing
of
that
kind
now
those
fellows
out
in
west
virginia
all
young
and
a
perfect
team
for
himself
he
owned
that
he
had
made
mistakes
he
could
see
just
where
the
mistakes
were
put
his
finger
right
on
them
but
one
thing
he
could
say
he
had
been
no
man
enemy
but
his
own
every
dollar
every
cent
had
gone
to
pay
his
debts
he
had
come
out
with
clean
hands
he
said
all
this
and
much
more
to
sewell
the
summer
after
he
sold
out
when
the
minister
and
his
wife
stopped
at
lapham
on
their
way
across
from
the
white
mountains
to
lake
champlain
lapham
had
found
them
on
the
cars
and
pressed
them
to
stop
off
there
were
times
when
lapham
had
as
great
pride
in
the
with
which
lapham
had
come
out
as
he
had
himself
but
her
satisfaction
was
not
so
constant
at
those
times
knowing
the
temptations
he
had
resisted
she
thought
him
the
noblest
and
grandest
of
men
but
no
woman
could
endure
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
perfect
hero
and
there
were
other
times
when
she
reminded
him
that
if
he
had
kept
his
word
to
her
about
speculating
in
stocks
and
had
looked
after
the
insurance
of
his
property
half
as
carefully
as
he
had
looked
after
a
couple
of
worthless
women
who
had
no
earthly
claim
on
him
they
would
not
be
where
they
were
now
he
humbly
admitted
it
all
and
left
her
to
think
of
rogers
herself
she
did
not
fail
to
do
so
and
the
thought
did
not
fail
to
restore
him
to
her
tenderness
again
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
that
clergymen
and
physicians
keep
from
telling
their
wives
the
secrets
confided
to
them
perhaps
they
can
trust
their
wives
to
find
them
out
for
themselves
whenever
they
wish
sewell
had
laid
before
his
wife
the
case
of
the
laphams
after
they
came
to
consult
with
him
about
corey
proposal
to
penelope
for
he
wished
to
be
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
he
had
advised
them
soundly
but
he
had
not
given
her
their
names
and
he
had
not
known
corey
himself
now
he
had
no
compunctions
in
talking
the
affair
over
with
her
without
the
veil
of
ignorance
which
she
had
hitherto
assumed
for
she
declared
that
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
corey
engagement
to
penelope
the
whole
thing
had
flashed
upon
her
and
that
night
at
dinner
i
could
have
told
the
child
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
sister
by
the
way
he
talked
about
her
i
heard
him
and
if
she
had
not
been
so
blindly
in
love
with
him
herself
she
would
have
known
it
too
i
must
say
i
ca
help
feeling
a
sort
of
contempt
for
her
sister
oh
but
you
must
not
cried
sewell
that
is
wrong
cruelly
wrong
i
sure
that
out
of
your
my
dear
and
not
out
of
your
heart
come
it
grieves
me
to
hear
you
say
such
a
thing
as
that
oh
i
dare
say
this
pretty
thing
has
got
over
it
how
much
character
she
has
got
and
i
suppose
she
see
somebody
else
sewell
had
to
content
himself
with
this
partial
concession
as
a
matter
of
fact
unless
it
was
the
young
west
virginian
who
had
come
on
to
arrange
the
purchase
of
the
works
irene
had
not
yet
seen
any
one
and
whether
there
was
ever
anything
between
them
is
a
fact
that
would
need
a
separate
inquiry
it
is
certain
that
at
the
end
of
five
years
after
the
disappointment
which
she
met
so
bravely
she
was
still
unmarried
but
she
was
even
then
still
very
young
and
her
life
at
lapham
had
been
varied
by
visits
to
the
west
it
had
also
been
varied
by
an
invitation
made
with
the
politest
resolution
by
corey
to
visit
in
boston
which
the
girl
was
equal
to
refusing
in
the
same
spirit
sewell
was
intensely
interested
in
the
moral
spectacle
which
lapham
presented
under
his
changed
conditions
the
colonel
who
was
more
the
colonel
in
those
hills
than
he
could
ever
have
been
on
the
back
bay
kept
him
and
sewell
over
night
at
his
house
and
he
showed
the
minister
minutely
round
the
works
and
drove
him
all
over
his
farm
for
this
expedition
he
employed
a
lively
colt
which
had
not
yet
come
of
age
and
an
open
buggy
long
past
its
prime
and
was
no
more
ashamed
of
his
turnout
than
of
the
finest
he
had
ever
driven
on
the
milldam
he
was
rather
shabby
and
slovenly
in
dress
and
he
had
fallen
unkempt
after
the
country
fashion
as
to
his
hair
and
beard
and
boots
the
house
was
plain
and
was
furnished
with
the
simpler
moveables
out
of
the
house
in
nankeen
square
there
were
certainly
all
the
necessaries
but
no
luxuries
unless
the
statues
of
prayer
and
faith
might
be
so
considered
the
laphams
now
burned
kerosene
of
course
and
they
had
no
furnace
in
the
winter
these
were
the
only
hardships
the
colonel
complained
of
but
he
said
that
as
soon
as
the
company
got
to
paying
dividends
again
he
was
evidently
proud
of
the
outlays
that
for
the
present
prevented
this
he
should
put
in
steam
heat
and
he
spoke
freely
of
his
failure
and
with
a
confidence
that
seemed
inspired
by
his
former
trust
in
sewell
whom
indeed
he
treated
like
an
intimate
friend
rather
than
an
acquaintance
of
two
or
three
meetings
he
went
back
to
his
first
connection
with
rogers
and
he
put
before
sewell
hypothetically
his
own
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
matter
sometimes
he
said
i
get
to
thinking
it
all
over
and
it
seems
to
me
i
done
wrong
about
rogers
in
the
first
place
that
the
whole
trouble
came
from
that
it
was
just
like
starting
a
row
of
bricks
i
tried
to
catch
up
and
stop
from
going
but
they
all
tumbled
one
after
another
it
in
the
nature
of
things
that
they
could
be
stopped
till
the
last
brick
went
i
do
talk
much
with
my
wife
any
more
about
it
but
i
should
like
to
know
how
it
strikes
you
we
can
trace
the
operation
of
evil
in
the
physical
world
replied
the
minister
but
i
more
and
more
puzzled
about
it
in
the
moral
world
there
its
course
is
often
so
very
obscure
and
often
it
seems
to
involve
so
far
as
we
can
see
no
penalty
whatever
and
in
your
own
case
as
i
understand
you
do
admit
you
do
feel
sure
that
you
ever
actually
did
wrong
this
man
well
no
i
do
that
is
to
say
he
did
not
continue
and
after
a
while
sewell
said
with
that
subtle
kindness
of
his
i
should
be
inclined
to
think
nothing
can
be
thrown
quite
away
and
it
ca
be
that
our
sins
only
weaken
us
that
your
fear
of
having
possibly
behaved
selfishly
toward
this
man
kept
you
on
your
guard
and
strengthened
you
when
you
were
brought
face
to
face
with
a
greater
he
was
going
to
say
temptation
but
he
saved
pride
and
said
emergency
do
you
think
so
i
think
that
there
may
be
truth
in
what
i
suggest
well
i
do
know
what
it
was
said
lapham
all
i
know
is
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
although
i
could
see
that
i
got
to
go
under
unless
i
did
it
that
i
could
sell
out
to
those
englishmen
and
i
could
let
that
man
put
his
money
into
my
business
without
i
told
him
just
how
things
stood
as
sewell
afterwards
told
his
wife
he
could
see
that
the
loss
of
his
fortune
had
been
a
terrible
trial
to
lapham
just
because
his
prosperity
had
been
so
gross
and
palpable
and
he
had
now
a
burning
desire
to
know
exactly
how
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
lapham
still
felt
and
do
you
ever
have
any
regrets
he
delicately
inquired
of
him
about
what
i
done
well
it
do
always
seem
as
if
i
done
it
replied
lapham
seems
sometimes
as
if
it
was
a
hole
opened
for
me
and
i
crept
out
of
it
i
do
know
he
added
thoughtfully
biting
the
corner
of
his
stiff
moustache
i
do
know
as
i
should
always
say
it
paid
but
if
i
done
it
and
the
thing
was
to
do
over
again
right
in
the
same
way
i
guess
i
should
have
to
do
it
