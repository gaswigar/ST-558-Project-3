the
miser
by
molière
translated
into
english
prose
with
a
short
introduction
and
explanatory
notes
by
charles
heron
wall
this
play
was
acted
for
the
first
time
on
september
in
it
molière
has
borrowed
from
plautus
and
has
imitated
several
other
authors
but
he
far
surpasses
them
in
the
treatment
of
his
subject
the
picture
of
the
miser
in
whom
love
of
money
takes
the
place
of
all
natural
affections
who
not
only
withdraws
from
family
intercourse
but
considers
his
children
as
natural
enemies
is
finely
drawn
and
renders
molière
miser
altogether
more
dramatic
and
moral
than
those
of
his
predecessors

val
what
dear
élise
you
grow
sad
after
having
given
me
such
dear
tokens
of
your
love
and
i
see
you
sigh
in
the
midst
of
my
joy
can
you
regret
having
made
me
happy
and
do
you
repent
of
the
engagement
which
my
love
has
forced
from
you
eli
no
valère
i
do
not
regret
what
i
do
for
you
i
feel
carried
on
by
too
delightful
a
power
and
i
do
not
even
wish
that
things
should
be
otherwise
than
they
are
yet
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
very
anxious
about
the
consequences
and
i
greatly
fear
that
i
love
you
more
than
i
should
val
what
can
you
possibly
fear
from
the
affection
you
have
shown
me
eli
everything
the
anger
of
my
father
the
reproaches
of
my
family
the
censure
of
the
world
and
above
all
valère
a
change
in
your
heart
i
fear
that
cruel
coldness
with
which
your
sex
so
often
repays
the
too
warm
proofs
of
an
innocent
love
val
alas
do
not
wrong
me
thus
do
not
judge
of
me
by
others
think
me
capable
of
everything
élise
except
of
falling
short
of
what
i
owe
to
you
i
love
you
too
much
for
that
and
my
love
will
be
as
lasting
as
my
life
eli
ah
valère
all
men
say
the
same
thing
all
men
are
alike
in
their
words
their
actions
only
show
the
difference
that
exists
between
them
val
then
why
not
wait
for
actions
if
by
them
alone
you
can
judge
of
the
truthfulness
of
my
heart
do
not
suffer
your
anxious
fears
to
mislead
you
and
to
wrong
me
do
not
let
an
unjust
suspicion
destroy
the
happiness
which
is
to
me
dearer
than
life
but
give
me
time
to
show
you
by
a
thousand
proofs
the
sincerity
of
my
affection
eli
alas
how
easily
do
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
persuaded
by
those
we
love
i
believe
you
valère
i
feel
sure
that
your
heart
is
utterly
incapable
of
deceiving
me
that
your
love
is
sincere
and
that
you
will
ever
remain
faithful
to
me
i
will
no
longer
doubt
that
happiness
is
near
if
i
grieve
it
will
only
be
over
the
difficulties
of
our
position
and
the
possible
censures
of
the
world
val
but
why
even
this
fear
eli
oh
valère
if
everybody
knew
you
as
i
do
i
should
not
have
much
to
fear
i
find
in
you
enough
to
justify
all
i
do
for
you
my
heart
knows
all
your
merit
and
feels
moreover
bound
to
you
by
deep
gratitude
how
can
i
forget
that
horrible
moment
when
we
met
for
the
first
time
your
generous
courage
in
risking
your
own
life
to
save
mine
from
the
fury
of
the
waves
your
tender
care
afterwards
your
constant
attentions
and
your
ardent
love
which
neither
time
nor
difficulties
can
lessen
for
me
you
neglect
your
parents
and
your
country
you
give
up
your
own
position
in
life
to
be
a
servant
of
my
father
how
can
i
resist
the
influence
that
all
this
has
over
me
is
it
not
enough
to
justify
in
my
eyes
my
engagement
to
you
yet
who
knows
if
it
will
be
enough
to
justify
it
in
the
eyes
of
others
and
how
can
i
feel
sure
that
my
motives
will
be
understood
val
you
try
in
vain
to
find
merit
in
what
i
have
done
it
is
by
my
love
alone
that
i
trust
to
deserve
you
as
for
the
scruples
you
feel
your
father
himself
justifies
you
but
too
much
before
the
world
and
his
avarice
and
the
distant
way
in
which
he
lives
with
his
children
might
authorise
stranger
things
still
forgive
me
my
dear
élise
for
speaking
thus
of
your
father
before
you
but
you
know
that
unfortunately
on
this
subject
no
good
can
be
said
of
him
however
if
i
can
find
my
parents
as
i
fully
hope
i
shall
they
will
soon
be
favourable
to
us
i
am
expecting
news
of
them
with
great
impatience
but
if
none
comes
i
will
go
in
search
of
them
myself
eli
oh
no
valère
do
not
leave
me
i
entreat
you
try
rather
to
ingratiate
yourself
in
my
father
favour
val
you
know
how
much
i
wish
it
and
you
can
see
how
i
set
about
it
you
know
the
skilful
manoeuvres
i
have
had
to
use
in
order
to
introduce
myself
into
his
service
under
what
a
mask
of
sympathy
and
conformity
of
tastes
i
disguise
my
own
feelings
to
please
him
and
what
a
part
i
play
to
acquire
his
affection
i
succeed
wonderfully
well
and
i
feel
that
to
obtain
favour
with
men
there
are
no
better
means
than
to
pretend
to
be
of
their
way
of
thinking
to
fall
in
with
their
maxims
to
praise
their
defects
and
to
applaud
all
their
doings
one
need
not
fear
to
overdo
it
for
however
gross
the
flattery
the
most
cunning
are
easily
duped
there
is
nothing
so
impertinent
or
ridiculous
which
they
will
not
believe
provided
it
be
well
seasoned
with
praise
honesty
suffers
i
acknowledge
but
when
we
have
need
of
men
we
may
be
allowed
without
blame
to
adapt
ourselves
to
their
mode
of
thought
and
if
we
have
no
other
hope
of
success
but
through
such
stratagem
it
is
not
after
all
the
fault
of
those
who
flatter
but
the
fault
of
those
who
wish
to
be
flattered
eli
why
do
you
not
try
also
to
gain
my
brother
goodwill
in
case
the
servant
should
betray
our
secret
val
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
humour
them
both
the
temper
of
the
father
is
so
different
from
that
of
the
son
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
be
the
confidant
of
both
at
the
same
time
rather
try
your
brother
yourself
make
use
of
the
love
that
exists
between
you
to
enlist
him
in
our
cause
i
leave
you
for
i
see
him
coming
speak
to
him
sound
him
and
see
how
far
we
can
trust
him
eli
i
greatly
fear
i
shall
never
have
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
of
my
secret
scene
cléante
élise
cle
i
am
very
glad
to
find
you
alone
sister
i
longed
to
speak
to
you
and
to
tell
you
a
secret
eli
i
am
quite
ready
to
hear
you
brother
what
is
it
you
have
to
tell
me
cle
many
things
sister
summed
up
in
one
word
love
eli
you
love
cle
yes
i
love
but
before
i
say
more
let
me
tell
you
that
i
know
i
depend
on
my
father
and
that
the
name
of
son
subjects
me
to
his
will
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
engage
ourselves
without
the
consent
of
the
authors
of
our
being
that
heaven
has
made
them
the
masters
of
our
affections
and
that
it
is
our
duty
not
to
dispose
of
ourselves
but
in
accordance
to
their
wish
that
their
judgment
is
not
biassed
by
their
being
in
love
themselves
that
they
are
therefore
much
more
likely
not
to
be
deceived
by
appearances
and
to
judge
better
what
is
good
for
us
that
we
ought
to
trust
their
experience
rather
than
the
passion
which
blinds
us
and
that
the
rashness
of
youth
often
carries
us
to
the
very
brink
of
dangerous
abysses
i
know
all
this
my
sister
and
i
tell
it
you
to
spare
you
the
trouble
of
saying
it
to
me
for
my
love
will
not
let
me
listen
to
anything
and
i
pray
you
to
spare
me
your
remonstrances
eli
have
you
engaged
yourself
brother
to
her
you
love
cle
no
but
i
have
determined
to
do
so
and
i
beseech
you
once
more
not
to
bring
forward
any
reason
to
dissuade
me
from
it
eli
am
i
such
a
very
strange
person
brother
cle
no
dear
sister
but
you
do
not
love
you
know
not
the
sweet
power
that
love
has
upon
our
hearts
and
i
dread
your
wisdom
eli
alas
my
brother
let
us
not
speak
of
my
wisdom
there
are
very
few
people
in
this
world
who
do
not
lack
wisdom
were
it
only
once
in
their
lifetime
and
if
i
opened
my
heart
to
you
perhaps
you
would
think
me
less
wise
than
you
are
yourself
cle
ah
would
to
heaven
that
your
heart
like
mine
eli
let
us
speak
of
you
first
and
tell
me
whom
it
is
you
love
cle
a
young
girl
who
has
lately
come
to
live
in
our
neighbourhood
and
who
seems
made
to
inspire
love
in
all
those
who
behold
her
nature
my
dear
sister
has
made
nothing
more
lovely
and
i
felt
another
man
the
moment
i
saw
her
her
name
is
marianne
and
she
lives
with
a
good
kind
mother
who
is
almost
always
ill
and
for
whom
the
dear
girl
shows
the
greatest
affection
she
waits
upon
her
pities
and
comforts
her
with
a
tenderness
that
would
touch
you
to
the
very
soul
whatever
she
undertakes
is
done
in
the
most
charming
way
and
in
all
her
actions
shine
a
wonderful
grace
a
most
winning
gentleness
an
adorable
modesty
a
ah
my
sister
how
i
wish
you
had
but
seen
her
eli
i
see
many
things
in
what
you
tell
me
dear
brother
and
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
know
that
you
love
her
for
me
to
understand
what
she
is
cle
i
have
discovered
without
their
knowing
it
that
they
are
not
in
very
good
circumstances
and
that
although
they
live
with
the
greatest
care
they
have
barely
enough
to
cover
their
expenses
can
you
imagine
my
sister
what
happiness
it
must
be
to
improve
the
condition
of
those
we
love
skilfully
to
bring
about
some
relief
to
the
modest
wants
of
a
virtuous
family
and
think
what
grief
it
is
for
me
to
find
myself
deprived
of
this
great
joy
through
the
avarice
of
a
father
and
for
it
to
be
impossible
for
me
to
give
any
proof
of
my
love
to
her
who
is
all
in
all
to
me
eli
yes
i
understand
dear
brother
what
sorrow
this
must
be
to
you
cle
it
is
greater
my
sister
than
you
can
believe
for
is
there
anything
more
cruel
than
this
mean
economy
to
which
we
are
subjected
this
strange
penury
in
which
we
are
made
to
pine
what
good
will
it
do
us
to
have
a
fortune
if
it
only
comes
to
us
when
we
are
not
able
to
enjoy
it
if
now
to
provide
for
my
daily
maintenance
i
get
into
debt
on
every
side
if
both
you
and
i
are
reduced
daily
to
beg
the
help
of
tradespeople
in
order
to
have
decent
clothes
to
wear
in
short
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
that
you
might
help
me
to
sound
my
father
concerning
my
present
feelings
and
if
i
find
him
opposed
to
them
i
am
determined
to
go
and
live
elsewhere
with
this
most
charming
girl
and
to
make
the
best
of
what
providence
offers
us
i
am
trying
everywhere
to
raise
money
for
this
purpose
and
if
your
circumstances
dear
sister
are
like
mine
and
our
father
opposes
us
let
us
both
leave
him
and
free
ourselves
from
the
tyranny
in
which
his
hateful
avarice
has
for
so
long
held
us
eli
it
is
but
too
true
that
every
day
he
gives
us
more
and
more
reason
to
regret
the
death
of
our
mother
and
that
cle
i
hear
his
voice
let
us
go
a
little
farther
and
finish
our
talk
we
will
afterwards

our
forces

we

see
well
enough
that
you
overheard
a
few
words
the
fact
is
i
was
only
talking
to
myself
about
the
trouble
one
has
nowadays
to
raise
any
money
and
i
was
saying
that
he
is
a
fortunate
man
who
has
ten
thousand
crowns
in

we
were
afraid
of
coming
near

of
intruding

glad
to
tell

enough
off

false

scoundrels

spread
such
reports

do
be
angry
har
it
is
strange
that
my

children
betray
me
and
become
my
enemies
cle
is
it
being
your
enemy
to
say
that
you
have
wealth
har
yes
it
is
such
talk
and
your
extravagant
expenses
will
be
the
cause
that
some
day
thieves
will
come
and
cut
my
throat
in
the
belief
that
i
am
made
of
gold
cle
what
extravagant
expenses
do
i
indulge
in
har
what
is
there
anything
more
scandalous
than
this
sumptuous
attire
with
which
you
jaunt
it
about
the
town
i
was
remonstrating
with
your
sister
yesterday
but
you
are
still
worse
it
cries
vengeance
to
heaven
and
were
we
to
calculate
all
you
are
wearing
from
head
to
foot
we
should
find
enough
for
a
good
annuity
i
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
my
son
that
your
manners
displease
me
exceedingly
you
affect
the
marquis
terribly
and
for
you
to
be
always
dressed
as
you
are
you
must
certainly
rob
me
cle
rob
you
and
how
har
how
should
i
know
where
else
could
you
find
money
enough
to
clothe
yourself
as
you
do
cle
i
father
i
play
and
as
i
am
very
lucky
i
spend
in
clothes
all
the
money
i
win
har
it
is
very
wrong
if
you
are
lucky
at
play
you
should
profit
by
it
and
place
the
money
you
win
at
decent
interest
so
that
you
may
find
it
again
some
day
i
should
like
to
know
for
instance
without
mentioning
the
rest
what
need
there
is
for
all
these
ribbons
with
which
you
are
decked
from
head
to
foot
and
if
half
a
dozen
tags
are
not
sufficient
to
fasten
your
breeches
what
necessity
is
there
for
anyone
to
spend
money
upon
wigs
when
we
have
hair
of
our
own
growth
which
costs
nothing
i
will
lay
a
wager
that
in
wigs
and
ribbons
alone
there
are
certainly
twenty
pistoles
spent
and
twenty
pistoles
brings
in
at
least
eighteen
livres
six
sous
eight
deniers
per
annum
at
only
eight
per

you
are
quite
right
har
enough
on

mean
by
those
signs

are
hesitating
as
to

speak
first

have
something
to
tell
you
har

i
also
have
something
to
tell
you

we
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about

har
the
very
thing
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
eli
ah
my
father
har
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
exclamation
is
it
the
word
daughter
or
the
thing
itself
that
frightens
you
cle
marriage
may
frighten
us
both
according
to
the
way
you
take
it
and
our
feelings
may
perhaps
not
coincide
with
your
choice
har
a
little
patience
if
you
please
you
need
not
be
alarmed

know
what
is
good
for
you
both

will
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
anything
i
intend
to
do

begin
at
the
beginning

do
you
know
tell
me
a
young
person
called
marianne

lives
not
far
from

you
eli
i
have
heard
her
spoken
of

well
my

how
do
you
like

she
is
very
charming
har
her
face
cle
modest
and
intelligent
har
her
air

manner

perfect

har
do
you
not
think
that
such
a

well
deserves
to
be
thought
of
cle
yes
father
har
she
would
form
a
very
desirable
match
cle
very
desirable
har
that
there
is
every
likelihood
of
her
making
a
thrifty
and
careful
wife
cle
certainly
har
and
that
a
husband
might
live
very
happily
with
her
cle
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
about
it
har
there
is
one
little
difficulty
i
am
afraid
she
has
not
the
fortune
we
might
reasonably
expect
cle
oh
my
father
riches
are
of
little
importance
when
one
is
sure
of
marrying
a
virtuous
woman

i
beg
your
pardon

there
is
this
to
be
said
that
if
we
do
not
find
as
much
money
as
we
could
wish
we
may
make
it
up
in
something
else

a
matter

i
must
say
that
i
am
very
much
pleased
to
find
that
you
entirely
agree
with
me
for
her
modest
manner
and
her
gentleness

won
my
heart

i
have
made
up
my
mind
to

what
does

this

i
feel
a
sudden
dizziness

i
must
withdraw

little
while

did
ever
anyone
see

approve

be
approved

we
make

in

he

will

scene
valère
harpagon
élise
har

we
have
chosen
you
to
decide
who
is
in
the
right
my
daughter
or
val
it
is
certainly
you
sir
har
but
have
you
any
idea
of
what
we
are
talking
about
val
no
but
you
could
not
be
in
the
wrong
you
are
reason
itself
har
i
want
to
give
her
for
a
husband
a
man
as
rich
as
he
is
good
and
the
hussy
tells
me
to
my
face
that
she
scorns
to
take
him
what
do
you
say
to
that
val
what
i
say
to
it
har
yes
val
eh
eh
har
what
val
i
say
that
i
am
upon
the
whole
of
your
opinion
and
that
you
can
not
but
be
right
yet
perhaps
she
is
not
altogether
wrong
and
har
how
so
anselme
is
an
excellent
match
he
is
a
nobleman
and
a
gentleman
too
of
simple
habits
and
extremely
well
off
he
has
no
children
left
from
his
first
marriage
could
she
meet
with
anything
more
suitable
val
it
is
true
but
she
might
say
that
you
are
going
rather
fast
and
that
she
ought
to
have
at
least
a
little
time
to
consider
whether
her
inclination
could
reconcile
itself
to
har
it
is
an
opportunity
i
must
not
allow
to
slip
through
my
fingers
i
find
an
advantage
here
which
i
should
not
find
elsewhere
and
he
agrees
to
take
her
without
dowry
val
without
dowry
har
yes
val
ah
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
a
more
convincing
reason
could
not
be
found
and
she
must
yield
to
that
har
it
is
a
considerable
saving
to
me
val
undoubtedly
this
admits
of
no
contradiction
it
is
true
that
your
daughter
might
represent
to
you
that
marriage
is
a
more
serious
affair
than
people
are
apt
to
believe
that
the
happiness
or
misery
of
a
whole
life
depends
on
it
and
that
an
engagement
which
is
to
last
till
death
ought
not
to
be
entered
into
without
great
consideration
har
without
dowry
val
that
must
of
course
decide
everything
there
are
certainly
people
who
might
tell
you
that
on
such
occasions
the
wishes
of
a
daughter
are
no
doubt
to
be
considered
and
that
this
great
disparity
of
age
of
disposition
and
of
feelings
might
be
the
cause
of
many
an
unpleasant
thing
in
a
married
life
har
without
dowry
val
ah
it
must
be
granted
that
there
is
no
reply
to
that
who
in
the
world
could
think
otherwise
i
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
there
are
many
fathers
who
would
set
a
much
higher
value
on
the
happiness
of
their
daughter
than
on
the
money
they
may
have
to
give
for
their
marriage
who
would
not
like
to
sacrifice
them
to
their
own
interests
and
who
would
above
all
things
try
to
see
in
a
marriage
that
sweet
conformity
of
tastes
which
is
a
sure
pledge
of
honour
tranquillity
and
joy
and
that
har
without
dowry
val
that
is
true
nothing
more
can
be
said
without

how
can
anyone
resist

arguments

meddling

thinking

he
mean
to
set
everybody
at
defiance

is
love
made
for
people
of
his

cle
it
is
to
punish
me
for
my
sins
that
this
passion
has
entered
his
head

why
do
you
hide
your
love
from
him
cle
that
he
may
not
suspect
anything
and
to
make
it
more
easy
for
me
to
fall
back

device
to
prevent
this
marriage
what
answer
did
you
receive

indeed
sir
those

much

pitied

wo
come
off

simon
the
broker

was
recommended
to

is
a
very
active
and
zealous
fellow

says
he
has
left
no
stone
unturned
to
help
you
he
assures
me
that
your
looks
alone
have
won
his
heart
cle
shall
i
have
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
which
i
want

but
under
certain
trifling
conditions
which
you
must
accept
if
you
wish
the
bargain
to
be
concluded

did
you
speak
to
the
man
who
is
to
lend
the
money
la
fl
oh
dear
no
things
are
not
done
in
that
way
he
is
still
more
anxious
than
you
to
remain
unknown
these
things
are
greater
mysteries
than
you
think
his
name
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
divulged
and
he
is
to
be
introduced
to
you
at
a
house
provided
by
him
so
that
he
may
hear
from
yourself
all
about
your
position
and
your
family
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
mere
name
of
your
father
will
be
sufficient
to
accomplish
what
you
wish
cle
particularly
as
my
mother
is
dead
and
they
can
not
deprive
me
of
what
i
inherit
from
her
la
fl
well
here
are
some
of
the
conditions
which
he
has
himself
dictated
to
our
for
you
to
take
cognisance
of
before
anything
is
begun
supposing
that
the
lender
is
satisfied
with
all
his
securities
and
that
the
borrower
is
of
age
and
of
a
family
whose
property
is
ample
solid
secure
and
free
from
all
incumbrances
there
shall
be
drawn
up
a
good
and
correct
bond
before
as
honest
a
notary
as
it
is
possible
to
find
and
who
for
this
purpose
shall
be
chosen
by
the
lender
because
he
is
the
more
concerned
of
the
two
that
the
bond
should
be
rightly
executed
cle
there
is
nothing
to
say
against
that
la
fl
the
lender
not
to
burden
his
conscience
with
the
least
scruple
does
not
wish
to
lend
his
money
at
more
than
five
and
a

by

that
honest
we
have
nothing
to
complain
of
la
fl
that
true
but
as
the
said
lender
has
not
in
hand

sum
required

in

to
oblige
the
borrower
he
is
himself
obliged
to
borrow
from
another
at

rate
of
twenty
per
it

right
that
the
said
first
borrower
shall
pay
this
interest
without
detriment
to
the
rest

it
is
only
to
oblige

loves

better
than

the
mere

of
anyone
making

upon

why

been
so
young
in

know
many
a
man

who
looks
much
older
than
you
do
har
and
yet
frosine
i
have
passed
threescore
fro
threescore

what
then
you
do

to
make
a
trouble
of

the
very
flower
of
manhood

threshold

prime

true
but
twenty
years

do
me
no
harm

nonsense
you
no
need
of
that
and
you
are
of
a
build
to
last
out
a
hundred

do
you

think
so

decidedly
you
have
all
the
appearance
of
it
hold
yourself
up

little
ah
what
a
sign
of
long
life
is
that
line
there
straight
between
your
two
eyes
har
you
know
all
about
that
do
you
fro
i
should
think
i
do
show
me
your
hand
footnote
frosine
professes
a
knowledge
of
palmistry
dear
me
what
a
line
of
life
there
is
there
har
where
fro
do
you
see
how
far
this
line
goes
har
well
and
what
does
it
mean
fro
what
does
it
mean
there
i
said
a
hundred
years
but
no
it
is
one
hundred
and
twenty
i
ought
to
have
said
har
is
it
possible
fro
i
tell
you
they
will
have
to
kill
you
and
you
will
bury
your
children
and
your
children
children
har
so
much
the
better
and
what
news
of
our
affair
fro
is
there
any
need
to
ask
did
ever
anyone
see
me
begin
anything
and
not
succeed
in
it
i
have
especially
for
matchmaking
the
most
wonderful
talent
there
are
no
two
persons
in
the
world
i
could
not
couple
together
and
i
believe
that
if
i
took
it
into
my
head
i
could
make
the
grand
turk
marry
the
republic
of
venice
but
we
had
to
be
sure
no
such
difficult
thing
to
achieve
in
this
matter
as
i
know
the
ladies
very
well
i
told
them
every
particular
about
you
and
i
acquainted
the
mother
with
your
intentions
towards
marianne
since
you
saw
her
pass
in
the
street
and
enjoy
the
fresh
air
out
of
her
window
har
what
did
she
answer
fro
she
received
your
proposal
with
great
joy
and
when
i
told
her
that
you
wished
very
much
that
her
daughter
should
come
to
assist
at
the
marriage
contract
which
is
to
be
signed
for
your
own
daughter
she
assented
at
once
and
entrusted
her
to
me
for
the
purpose
har
you
see
frosine
i
am
obliged
to
give
some
supper
to
anselme
and
i
should
like
her
to
have
a
share
in
the
feast
fro
you
are
quite
right
she
is
to
come
after
dinner
to
pay
a
visit
to
your
daughter
then
she
means
to
go
from
here
to
the
fair
and
return
to
your
house
just
in
time
for
supper
har
that
will
do
very
well
they
shall
go
together
in
my
carriage
which
i
will
lend
them
fro
that
will
suit
her
perfectly
har
but
i
say
frosine
have
you
spoken
to
the
mother
about
the
dowry
she
can
give
her
daughter
did
you
make
her
understand
that
under
such
circumstances
she
ought
to
do
her
utmost
and
to
make
a
great
sacrifice
for
after
all
one
does
not
marry
a
girl
without
her
bringing
something
with
her
fro
how
something
she
is
a
girl
who
will
bring
you
a
clear
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
har
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
fro
yes
to
begin
with
she
has
been
nursed
and
brought
up
with
the
strictest
notions
of
frugality
she
is
a
girl
accustomed
to
live
upon
salad
milk
cheese
and
apples
and
who
consequently
will
require
neither
a
well
served
up
table
nor
any
rich
broth
nor
your
everlasting
peeled
barley
none
in
short
of
all
those
delicacies
that
another
woman
would
want
this
is
no
small
matter
and
may
well
amount
to
three
thousand
francs
yearly
besides
this
she
only
cares
for
simplicity
and
neatness
she
will
have
none
of
those
splendid
dresses
and
rich
jewels
none
of
that
sumptuous
furniture
in
which
girls
like
her
indulge
so
extravagantly
and
this
item
is
worth
more
than
four
thousand
francs
per
annum
lastly
she
has
the
deepest
aversion
to
gambling
and
this
is
not
very
common
nowadays
among
women
why
i
know
of
one
in
our
neighbourhood
who
lost
at
least
twenty
thousand
francs
this
year
but
let
us
reckon
only
a
fourth
of
that
sum
five
thousand
francs
a
year
at
play
and
four
thousand
in
clothes
and
jewels
make
nine
thousand
and
three
thousand
francs
which
we
count
for
food
does
it
not
make
your
twelve
thousand
francs
har
yes
that
not
bad
but
after
all
that
calculation
has
nothing
real
in
it
fro
excuse
me
is
it
nothing
real
to
bring
you
in
marriage
a
great
sobriety
to
inherit
a
great
love
for
simplicity
in
dress
and
the
acquired
property
of
a
great
hatred
for
gambling
har
it
is
a
farce
to
pretend
to
make
up
a
dowry
with
all
the
expenses
she
will
not
run
into
i
could
not
give
a
receipt
for
what
i
do
not
receive
and
i
must
decidedly
get
something
fro
bless
me
you
will
get
enough
and
they
have
spoken
to
me
of
a
certain
country
where
they
have
some
property
of
which
you
will
be
master
har
we
shall
have
to
see
to
that
but
frosine
there
is
one
more
thing
that
makes
me
uneasy
the
girl
is
young
you
know
and
young
people
generally
like
those
who
are
young
like
themselves
and
only
care
for
the
society
of
the
young
i
am
afraid
that
a
man
of
my
age
may
not
exactly
suit
her
taste
and
that
this
may
occasion
in
my
family
certain
complications
that
would
in
nowise
be
pleasant
to
me
fro
oh
how
badly
you
judge
her
this
is
one
more
peculiarity
of
which
i
had
to
speak
to
you
she
has
the
greatest
detestation
to
all
young
men
and
only
likes
old
people
har
does
she
fro
i
should
like
you
to
hear
her
talk
on
that
subject
she
can
not
bear
at
all
the
sight
of
a
young
man
and
nothing
delights
her
more
than
to
see
a
fine
old
man
with
a
venerable
beard
the
oldest
are
to
her
the
most
charming
and
i
warn
you
beforehand
not
to
go
and
make
yourself
any
younger
than
you
really
are
she
wishes
for
one
sixty
years
old
at
least
and
it
is
not
more
than
six
months
ago
that
on
the
very
eve
of
being
married
she
suddenly
broke
off
the
match
on
learning
that
her
lover
was
only
years
of
age
and
did
not
put
on
spectacles
to
sign
the
contract
har
only
for
that
fro
yes
she
says
there
is
no
pleasure
with
a
man
of
and
she
has
a
decided
affection
for
those
who
wear
spectacles
har
well
this
is
quite
new
to
me
fro
no
one
can
imagine
how
far
she
carries
this
she
has
in
her
room
a
few
pictures
and
engravings
and
what
do
you
imagine
they
are
an
adonis
a
cephalus
a
paris
an
apollo
not
a
bit
of
it
fine
portraits
of
saturn
of
king
priam
of
old
nestor
and
of
good
father
anchises
on
his
son
shoulders
har
that
admirable
i
should
never
have
guessed
such
a
thing
and
i
am
very
pleased
to
hear
that
she
has
such
taste
as
this
indeed
had
i
been
a
woman
i
should
never
have
loved
young
fellows
fro
i
should
think
not
fine
trumpery
indeed
these
young
men
for
any
one
to
fall
in
love
with
fine
jackanapes
and
puppies
for
a
woman
to
hanker
after
i
should
like
to
know
what
relish
anyone
can
find
in
them
har
truly
i
do
understand
it
myself
and
i
can
not
make
out
how
it
is
that
some
women
dote
so
on
them
fro
they
must
be
downright
idiots
can
any
one
be
in
his
senses
who
thinks
youth
amiable
can
those
coxcombs
be
men
and
can
one
really
get
attached
to
such
animals
har
exactly
what
i
say
every
day
with
their
effeminate
voices
their
three
little
bits
of
a
beard
turned
up
like
cat
whiskers
their
tow
wigs
their
flowing
breeches
and
open
breasts
fro
yes
they
are
famous
guys
compared
with
yourself
in
you
we
see
something
like
a
man
there
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
eye
it
is
thus
that
one
should
be
made
and
dressed
to
inspire
love
har
then
you
think
i
am
pretty
well
fro
pretty
well
i
should
think
so
you
are
charming
and
your
face
would
make
a
beautiful
picture
turn
round
a
little
if
you
please
you
could
not
find
anything
better
anywhere
let
me
see
you
walk
you
have
a
body
free
and
easy
as
it
should
be
and
one
which
gives
no
sign
of
infirmity
har
i
have
nothing
the
matter
to
speak
of
i
am
thankful
to
say
it
is
only
my
cough
which
returns
from
time
to
time
fro
that
is
nothing
and
coughing
becomes
you
exceedingly
well
har
tell
me
frosine
has
marianne
seen
me
yet
has
she
not
noticed
me
when
i
passed
by
fro
no
but
we
have
had
many
conversations
about
you
i
gave
her
an
exact
description
of
your
person
and
i
did
not
fail
to
make
the
most
of
your
merit
and
to
show
her
what
an
advantage
it
would
be
to
have
a
husband
like
you
har
you
did
right
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
it
fro
i
have
sir
a
small
request
to
make
to
you
i
am
in
danger
of
losing
a
lawsuit
for
want
of
a
little
money
harpagon
and
you
can
easily
help
me
with
it
if
you
have
pity
upon
me
you
can
not
imagine
how
happy
she
will
be
to
see
you
harpagon
oh
how
sure
you
are
to
please
her
and
how
sure
that
antique
ruff
of
yours
is
to
produce
a
wonderful
effect
on
her
mind
but
above
all
she
will
be
delighted
with
your
breeches
fastened
to
your
doublet
with
tags
that
will
make
her
mad
after
you
and
a
lover
who
wears
tags
will
be
most
welcome
to
her
har
you
send
me
into
raptures
frosine
by
saying
that
fro
i
tell
you
the
truth
sir
this
lawsuit
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
me
harpagon
serious
if
i
lose
it
i
am
for
ever
ruined

a
very
small
sum
will
save
me

like
you
to
have
seen
the
happiness
she
felt
when
i
spoke
of
you
to
her
harpagon

joy

in
her
eyes

i
told
her
of
all
your
good
qualities

i
succeeded
in
short
in
making
her
look
forward
with
the
greatest
impatience
to
the
conclusion
of
the
match

you
have
given
me
great
pleasure

you

little
assistance

it
not
the
easiest

most
stupid

much
but
a
clever
man
should
talk
of

good
supper

little
money

good
supper

little
money
val
yes
jac
valère

oblige
me
greatly

how

table

only
reckon
for
eight
when
there
is
enough

enough
for
ten

is
evident

read
a
little
the
precepts
of
health
and
ask
the
doctors
if
there
is
anything
so
hurtful
to
man
as
excess
in
eating
har
he
is
perfectly
right
val
know
master
jacques
you
and
people
like
you
that
a
table
overloaded
with
eatables
is
a
real
that
to
be
the
true
friends
of
those
we
invite
frugality
should
reign
throughout
the
repast
we
give
and
that
according
to
the
saying
of
one
of
the
ancients
we
must
eat
to
live
and
not
live
to
eat
har
ah
how
well
the
man
speaks
come
near
let
me
embrace
you
for
this
last
saying

is
the
finest
sentence

i
have
ever
heard
in
my
life

must
live
to
eat
and
not
eat
to
live
no
that
it
how
do
you
say
it

must
eat
to
live
and
not
live
to

master
jacques
yes
do
you
hear
that
valère
who
is
the
great
man
who
said
that
val
i
do
not
exactly
recollect
his
name
just
now
har
remember
to
write
down
those
words
for
me
i
will
have
them
engraved
in
letters
of
gold
over
the
of
my
val
i
will
not
fail
as
for
your
supper
you
had
better
let
me
manage
it
i
will
see
that
it
is
all
as
it
should
be
har
do
so
jac
so
much
the
better
all
the
less
work
for
me
har
valère
we
must
have
some
of
those
things
of
which
it
is
not
possible
to
eat
much
and
that
satisfy
directly
some
good
fat
beans
and
a
pâté
well
stuffed
with
chestnuts
val
trust
to
me
har
now
master
jacques
you
must
clean
my
carriage
jac
wait
a
moment
this
is
to
the
coachman
jacques
on
his
you
say
har
that
you
must
clean
my
carriage
and
have
my
horses
ready
to
drive
to
the
fair
jac
your
horses
upon
my
word
sir
they
are
not
at
all
in
a
condition
to
stir
i
wo
tell
you
that
they
are
laid
up
for
the
poor
things
have
got
nothing
to
lie
upon
and
it
would
not
be
telling
the
truth
but
you
make
them
keep
such
rigid
fasts
that
they
are
nothing
but
phantoms
ideas
and
mere
shadows
of
horses
har
they
are
much
to
be
pitied
they
have
nothing
to
do
jac
and
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
must
they
have
nothing
to
eat
it
would
be
much
better
for
them
poor
things
to
work
much
and
eat
to
correspond
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
them
so
reduced
for
in
short
i
love
my
horses
and
when
i
see
them
suffer
it
seems
as
if
it
were
myself
every
day
i
take
the
bread
out
of
my
own
mouth
to
feed
them
and
it
is
being
too
sir
to
have
no
compassion
upon
one
neighbour
har
it
wo
be
very
hard
work
to
go
to
the
fair
jac
no
sir
i
have
the
heart
to
drive
them
it
would
go
too
much
against
my
conscience
to
use
the
whip
to
them
in
the
state
they
are
in
how
could
you
expect
them
to
drag
a
carriage
they
have
not
even
strength
enough
to
drag
themselves
along
val
sir
i
will
ask
our
neighbour
picard
to
drive
them
particularly
as
we
shall
want
his
help
to
get
the
supper
ready
jac
be
it
so
i
had
much
rather
they
should
die
under
another
hand
than
under
mine
val
master
jacques
is
mightily
considerate
jac
mr
steward
is
mightily
indispensable
har
peace
jac
sir
i
ca
bear
these
flatteries
and
i
can
see
that
whatever
this
man
does
his
continual
watching
after
the
bread
wine
wood
salt
and
candles
is
done
but
to
curry
favour
and
to
make
his
court
to
you
i
am
indignant
to
see
it
all
and
i
am
sorry
to
hear
every
day
what
is
said
of
you
for
after
all
i
have
a
certain
tenderness
for
you
and
except
my
horses
you
are
the
person
i
like
most
in
the
world
har
and
i
would
know
from
you
master
jacques
what
it
is
that
is
said
of
me
jac
yes
certainly
sir
if
i
were
sure
you
would
not
get
angry
with
me
har
no
no
never
fear
jac
excuse
me
but
i
am
sure
you
will
be
angry
har
no
on
the
contrary
you
will
oblige
me
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
people
say
of
me
jac
since
you
wish
it
sir
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
you
are
the
of
everybody
that
they
taunt
us
everywhere
by
a
thousand
jokes
on
your
account
and
that
nothing
delights
people
more
than
to
make
sport
of
you
and
to
tell
stories
without
end
about
your
stinginess
one
says
that
you
have
special
almanacks
printed
where
you
double
the
ember
days
and
vigils
so
that
you
may
profit
by
the
fasts
to
which
you
bind
all
your
house
another
that
you
always
have
a
quarrel
for
your
servants
at
christmas
time
or
when
they
leave
you
so
that
you
may
give
them
nothing

tells
a
story
how
not
long
since
you
prosecuted
a
neighbour

because
it
had
eaten
up
the
remainder
of
a
leg
of
mutton

says
that
one
night
you
were
caught
stealing
your
horses
oats
and
that
your
coachman
that
is
the
man
who
was
before
me
gave
you
in
the
dark
a
good
sound
drubbing
of
which
you
said
nothing
in
short
what
is
the
use
of
going
on

we
are
sure
to
hear
you
pulled
to
pieces

the
butt

anyone
mention
you

names

are
here

mar
ah
frosine
how
strange
i
feel
and
how
i
dread
this
interview
fro
why
should
you
what
can
you
possibly
dread
mar
alas
can
you
ask
me
can
you
not
understand
the
alarms
of
a
person
about
to
see
the
instrument
of
torture
to
which
she
is
to
be
tied
fro
i
see
very
well
that
to
die
agreeably
harpagon
is
not
the
torture
you
would
embrace
and
i
can
judge
by
your
looks
that
the
fair
young
man
you
spoke
of
to
me
is
still
in
your
thoughts
mar
yes
frosine
it
is
a
thing
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
the
respectful
visits
he
has
paid
at
our
house
have
left
i
confess
a
great
impression
on
my
heart
fro
but
do
you
know
who
he
is
mar
no
i
do
not
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
made
to
be
loved
that
if
things
were
left
to
my
choice
i
would
much
rather
marry
him
than
any
other
and
that
he
adds
not
a
little
to
the
horrible
dread
that
i
have
of
the
husband
they
want
to
force
upon
me
fro
oh
yes
all
those
dandies
are
very
pleasant
and
can
talk
agreeably
enough
but
most
of
them
are
as
poor
as
church
mice
and
it
is
much
better
for
you
to
marry
an
old
husband
who
gives
you
plenty
of
money
i
fully
acknowledge
that
the
senses
somewhat
clash
with
the
end
i
propose
and
that
there
are
certain
little
inconveniences
to
be
endured
with
such
a
husband
but
all
that
wo
last
and
his
death
believe
me
will
soon
put
you
in
a
position
to
take
a
more
pleasant
husband
who
will
make
amends
for
all
mar
oh
frosine
what
a
strange
state
of
things
that
in
order
to
be
happy
we
must
look
forward
to
the
death
of
another
yet
death
will
not
fall
in
with
all
the
projects
we
make
fro
you
are
joking
you
marry
him
with
the
express
understanding
that
he
will
soon
leave
you
a
widow
it
must
be
one
of
the
articles
of
the
marriage
contract
it
would
be
very
wrong
in
him
not
to
die
before
three
months
are
over
here
he
is
himself
mar
ah
dear
frosine
what
a
face
scene

glasses

i
know
that
your
beauty
is
great
enough
to
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
but
still
it
is
with
glasses
that
we
look
at
the
stars
and
i
maintain
and
uphold
that
you
are
a
star
the
most
beautiful
and
in
the
land
of
stars
frosine
she
does
not
answer
star
it
seems
to
me
shows
no
joy
at
the
sight
of
me
fro
it
is
because
she
is
still
quite
and
young
girls
are
always
shy
at
first
and
afraid
of
showing
what
they
feel

frosine
you
are
right

for

much

comes
to

his
respects
to

frosine
oh
frosine
what
a
strange
meeting
he
is
the
very
one
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
fro
marianne
well
that
is
extraordinary
har
you
are
surprised
to
see
that
my
children
can
be
so
old
but
i
shall
soon
get
rid
of
both
of
them
cle
marianne
madam
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
little
expected
such
an
event
and
my
father
surprised
me
not
a
little
when
he
told
me
of
the
decision
he
had
come
to
mar
i
can
say
the
same
thing
it
is
an
unexpected
meeting
and
i
certainly
was
far
from
being
prepared
for
such
an
event
cle
madam
my
father
can
not
make
a
better
choice
and
it
is
a
great
joy
to
me
to
have
the
honour
of
welcoming
you
here
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
say
that
i
should
rejoice
if
it
were
your
intention
to
become
my
stepmother
i
must
confess
that
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
pay
you
the
compliment
and
it
is
a
title
forgive
me
that
i
can
not
wish
you
to
have
to
some
this
speech
would
seem
coarse
but
i
feel
that
you
understand
it
this
marriage
madam
is
altogether
repugnant
to
me
you
are
not
ignorant
now
that
you
know
who
i
am
how
opposed
it
is
to
all
my
own
interests
and
with
my
father
permission
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
if
things
depended
on
me
it
would
never
take
place
har
what
a
very
impertinent
speech
to
make
and
what
a
confession
to
make
to
her
mar
and
as
my
answer
i
must
tell
you
that
things
are
much
the
same
with

is
so
painful

impertinence

he
has
not
at

offended

i
am
thankful

openly

care
greatly
for
such
a
confession
from

if
he
had
spoken
differently
i
should
feel
much
less
esteem
for
him

it

very
kind
of
you

excuse
him

make
him
wiser

will
change

will
never
change

earnestly
beg
of
you

believe

such
folly

not
given

a
heart

i

too
ready
to
help

can

invent
something
to
undo
what
you
have
done
fro
rather
a
difficult
piece
of
business

as
far
as
your
mother
is
concerned
she
is
not
altogether
unreasonable
and
we
might
succeed
in
making
her
give
to
the
son
the
gift
she
reserved
for
the
father
cléante
but
the
most
disheartening
part
of
it
all
is
that
your
father
is
your
father
cle
yes
so
it
is
fro
i
mean
that
he
will
bear
malice
if
he
sees
that
he
is
refused
and
he
will
be
in
no
way
disposed
afterwards
to
give
his
consent
to
your
marriage
it
would
be
well
if
the
refusal
could
be
made
to
come
from
him
and
you
ought
to
try
by
some
means
or
other
to
make
him
dislike
you
marianne
cle
you
are
quite
right
fro
yes
right
enough
no
doubt
that
is
what
ought
to
be
done
but
how
in
the
world
are
we
to
set
about
it
wait
a
moment
suppose
we
had
a
somewhat
elderly
woman
with
a
little
of
the
ability
which
i
possess
and
able
sufficiently
well
to
represent
a
lady
of
rank
by
means
of
a
retinue
made
up
in
haste
and
of
some
whimsical
title
of
a
marchioness
or
viscountess
whom
we
would
suppose
to
come
from
lower
brittany
i
should
have
enough
power
over
your
father
to
persuade
him
that
she
is
a
rich
woman
in
possession
besides
her
houses
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
ready
money
that
she
is
deeply
in
love
with
him
and
that
she
would
marry
him
at
any
cost
were
she
even
to
give
him
all
her
money
by
the
marriage
contract
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
listen
to
the
proposal
for
certainly
he
loves
you
very
much
my
dear
but
he
loves
money
still
better
when
once
he
has
consented
to
your
marriage
it
does
not
signify
much
how
he
finds
out
the
true
state
of
affairs
about
our
marchioness

all
that
is
very
well
made
up

will
do
beautifully

over

sweet
persuasions

tender

so
so
har
but
still
cle
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
not
find
her
such
as
i
expected
her
manner
is
that
of
a
thorough
coquette
her
figure
is
rather
awkward
her
beauty
very
middling
and
her
intelligence
of
the
meanest
order
do
not
suppose
that
i
say
this
to
make
you
dislike
her
for
if
i
must
have
a

like
the
idea
of
this
one
as
well
as
of
any
other
har
you
spoke
to
her
just

cle
i
paid
her
several
compliments

it
was
to
please

so
then
you
do
care
for
her
cle
who
i
not
in
the
least
har
i
am
sorry
for
it
for
that
puts
an
end
to
a
scheme
which
had
occurred
to
me
since
i
have
seen
her
here
i
have
been
thinking
of
my
own
age
and
i
feel
that
people
would
find
fault
with
me
for
marrying
so
young
a
girl
this
consideration
had
made
me
determine
to
abandon
the
project
and
as
i
had
demanded
her
in
marriage
and
had
given
her
my
promise
i
would
have
given
her
to
you

it
were

dislike
you
have

har
in

cle
it
is
true
she
is
not
at
all

my
taste
but
to
please
you

i
will
bring
myself
to
marry
her
if
you
please
har
if
i
please
i
am
more
reasonable
than
you
think

do
wish
to
compel
you

excuse

will
make
an
attempt
to
love
her
har
no
no
a
marriage
can
not
be
happy
where
there
is
no
love
cle
that
my
father
will
perhaps
come
by
and
by
and
it
is
said
that
love
is
often
the
fruit
of
marriage
har
no
it
is
not
right
to
risk
it
on
the
side
of
the
man
and
there
are
some
troublesome
things
i
do
care
to
run
the
chance
of
if
you
had
felt
any
inclination
for
her
you
should
have
married
her
instead
of
me

as
it
is
i
will
return
to
my
first
intention
and
marry
her
myself
cle
well
father
since
things
are
so
i
had
better
be
frank
with
you
and
reveal
our
secret
to
you
the
truth
is
that
i
have
loved
her
ever
since
i
saw
her
one
day
on
the
promenade
i
intended
to
ask
you
today
to
let
me
marry
her
and
i
was
only
deterred
from
it
because
you
spoke
of
marrying
her
and
because
i
feared
to
displease
you
har
have
you
ever
paid
her
any
visits
cle
yes

har
many
cle
yes
considering
how
long
we
have
been
acquainted
har
you
were
well
received
cle
very
well
but
without
her
knowing
who
i
was
and
that
is
why
marianne
was
so
surprised
when
she
saw
me
today
har
have
you
told
her
of
your
love
and
of
your
intention
of
marrying
her
cle
certainly
and
i
also
spoke
a
little
to
the
mother
on
the
subject

did
she
kindly
receive
your
proposal
for
her
daughter
cle
yes
very
kindly
har
and
does
the
daughter
return
your
love
cle
if
i
can
believe
appearances
she
is
certainly
well
disposed
towards
me
har
well
i
am
very
glad
to
have
found
out
this
secret

is
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
know

you
will
have

of

may
see
that
i
have
right
on

go
a
little
farther
back

a
young

i
love
and
want
to
marry

the
scoundrel
has
the
impudence
to
love
her
also
and
wants
to
marry
her
in
spite
of
me
jac
oh
he
is
wrong
har
is
it
not
an
abominable
thing
to
see
a
son
who
does
not
shrink
from
becoming
the
rival
of
his
father
and
is
it
not
his
bounden
duty
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
my
love
jac
you
are
quite
right
stop
here
and
let
me
go
and
speak
to
him
cle
master
jacques
comes
near
very
well
if
he
wants
to
make
you
a
judge
between
us
i
have
no
objection
i
care
little
who
it
is
and
i
do
mind
referring
our
quarrel
to
you
jac
you
do
me
great
honour
cle
i
am
in
love
with
a
young
girl
who
returns
my
affection
and
who
receives
kindly
the
offer
of
my
heart
but
my
father
takes
it
into
his
head
to
disturb
our
love
by
asking
her
in
marriage
jac
he
certainly
is
wrong
cle
is
it
not
shameful
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
think
of
marrying
i
ask
you
if
it
is
right
for
him
to
fall
in
love
and
ought
he
not
now
to
leave
that
to
younger
men
jac
you
are
quite
right
he
is
not
serious
let
me
speak
a
word
or
two
to
him
harpagon
really
your
son
is
not
so
extravagant
as
you
think
and
is
amenable
to
reason
he
says
that
he
is
conscious
of
the
respect
he
owes
you
and
that
he
only
got
angry
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
he
will
willingly
submit
to
all
you
wish
if
you
will
only
promise
to
treat
him
more
kindly
than
you
do
and
will
give
him
in
marriage
a
person
to
his
taste
har
ah
tell
him
master
jacques
that
he
will
obtain
everything
from
me
on
those
terms
and
that
except
marianne
i
leave
him
free
to
choose
for
his
wife
whomsoever
he
pleases
jac
leave
that
to
me
cléante
really
your
father
is
not
so
unreasonable
as
you
make
him
out
to
me
and
he
tells
me
that
it
is
your
violence
which
irritated
him
he
only
objects
to
your
way
of
doing
things
and
is
quite
ready
to
grant
you
all
you
want
provided
you
will
use
gentle
means
and
will
give
him
the
deference
respect
and
submission
that
a
son
owes
to
his
father
cle
ah
master
jacques
you
can
assure
him
that
if
he
grants
me
marianne
he
will
always
find
me
the
most
submissive
of
men
and
that
i
shall
never
do
anything
contrary
to
his
pleasure

harpagon

all
right

consents
to
what
you
say

nothing
could
be
better

cléante
it
all
settled
he
is
satisfied
with
your
promises

heaven
be
praised

have
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
quietly
over
the
matter
together

are
agreed
now

losing
it
to
leave
it

ask
you
on
my
knees
to
leave
in
my
possession
this
treasure
so
full
of
charms
and
if
you
do
right
you
will
grant
it
to
me

i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind

in
the
world

you
driving
at

we
have
pledged
our
faith
to
each

and
have
taken
an
oath
never
to
forsake
one
another

the
oath
is
admirable
and
the
promise

enough

well

bewitched

i
have
told
you
already

that
it
is
not

hear
presently

it
is
out
of

the
violence

i
beg
of

is
any
harm
done

am
the
only
one
guilty
and
that
your
daughter
has
done
nothing
wrong
in
all
this

i
should
think
not
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
my
daughter
had
a
share
in
this
crime
but
i
will
have
that
treasure
back
again
and
you
must
confess
to
what
place
you
have
carried
it
off

have
not
carried
it
off

inquiring
about

am
attacked

honour

a
scoundrel
and
a
wretch
who
has
violated
the
most
sacred
rights
who
has
introduced
himself
into
my
house
as
a
servant
in
order
to
steal
my
money
and
seduce
my
daughter

who
ever
thought
of
your
money

which
you
rave

they
have
given

a
promise
of

insult
concerns
you
anselme

it
is
you
who
ought
to
be

at

the
utmost
in

revenged

it
is
not
my
intention
to
force
anybody
to
marry
me

to
lay
claim
to
a
heart
which
has
already
bestowed
itself

as
far
as
your
interests
are
concerned
i
am
ready
to
espouse
them
as
if
they
were
my
own
har
this
is
the
gentleman

honest
commissary

has
promised
that
he
will
omit
nothing
of
what
concerns
the
duties
of
his
office

charge
him
sir
as
he
ought
to
be
and
make

very
criminal
val
i
do
not
see
what
crime
they
can
make
of
my
passion
for
your
daughter
nor
the
punishment
you
think
i
ought
to
be
condemned
to
for
our
engagement
when
it
is
known
who
i
am
har
i
do
care
a
pin
for
all
those
stories
and
the
world
is
full
nowadays
of
those
pretenders
to
nobility
of
those
impostors
who
take
advantage
of
their
obscurity
and
deck
themselves
out
insolently
with
the
first
illustrious
name
that
comes
into
their
head
val
know
that
i
am
too
upright
to
adorn
myself
with
a
name
which
is
not
mine
and
that
all
naples
can
bear
testimony
to
my
birth
ans
softly
take
care
of
what
you
are
about
to
say
you
speak
before
a
man
to
whom
all
naples
is
known
and
who
can
soon
see
if
your
story
is
true
val
putting
on
his
i
am
not
the
man
to
fear
anything
and
if
all
naples
is
known
to
you
you
know
who
was
don
thomas
ans
certainly
i
know
who
he
is
and
few
people
know
him
better
than
i
do
har
i
care
neither
for
don
thomas
nor
don
martin
two
candles
burning
he
blows
one
ans
have
patience
and
let
him
speak
we
shall
soon
know
what
he
has
to
say
of
him
val
that
it
is
to
him
that
i
owe
my
birth
ans
to
him
val
yes
ans
nonsense
you
are
laughing
try
and
make
out
a
more
likely
story
and
do
pretend
to
shelter
yourself
under
such
a
piece
of
imposture
val
consider
your
words
better
before
you
speak
it
is
no
imposture
and
i
say
nothing
here
that
i
can
not
prove
ans
what
you
dare
to
call
yourself
the
son
of
don
thomas
val
yes
i
dare
to
do
so
and
i
am
ready
to
maintain
the
truth
against
anyone
who
ever
he
may
be
ans
this
audacity
is
marvellous
learn
to
your
confusion
that
it
is
now
at
least
sixteen
years
ago
since
the
man
of
whom
you
speak
died
in
a
shipwreck
at
sea
with
his
wife
and
children
when
he
was
trying
to
save
their
lives
from
the
cruel
persecutions
which
accompanied
the
troubles
at
naples
and
which
caused
the
banishment
of
several
noble
families
val
yes
but
learn
to
your
confusion
that
his
son
seven
years
of
age
was
with
a
servant
saved
from
the
wreck
by
a
spanish
vessel
and
that
this
son
is
he
who
now
speaks
to
you
learn
that
the
captain
of
that
ship
touched
with
compassion
at
my
misfortune
loved
me
that
he
had
me
brought
up
as
his
own
son
and
that
the
profession
of
arms
has
been
my
occupation
ever
since
i
was
fit
for
it
that
lately
i
heard
that
my
father
is
not
dead
as
i
thought
he
was
that
passing
this
way
to
go
and
find
him
out
an
accident
arranged
by
heaven
brought
to
my
sight
the
charming
élise
that
the
sight
of
her
made
me
a
slave
to
her
beauty
and
that
the
violence
of
my
love
and
the
harshness
of
her
father
made
me
take
the
resolution
to
come
into
his
house
disguised
as
a
servant
and
to
send
some
one
else
to
look
after
my
parents
ans
but
what
other
proofs
have
you
besides
your
own
words
that
all
this
is
not
a
fable
based
by
you
upon
truth
val
what
proofs
the
captain
of
the
spanish
vessel
a
ruby
seal
which
belonged
to
my
father
an
agate
bracelet
which
my
mother
put
upon
my
arm
and
old
pedro
that
servant
who
was
saved
with
me
from
the
wreck
mar
alas
i
can
answer
here
for
what
you
have
said
that
you
do
not
deceive
us
and
all
you
say
clearly
tells
me
that
you
are
my
brother
val
you
my
sister
mar
yes
my
heart
was
touched
as
soon
as
you
began
to
speak
and
our
mother
who
will
be
delighted
at
seeing
you
often
told
me
of
the
misfortunes
of
our
family
heaven
spared
us
also
in
that
dreadful
wreck
but
our
life
was
spared
at
the
cost
of
our
liberty
for
my
mother
and
myself
were
taken
up
by
pirates
from
the
wreck
of
our
vessel
after
ten
years
of
slavery
a
lucky
event
gave
us
back
to
liberty
and
we
returned
to
naples
where
we
found
all
our
property
sold
and
could
hear
no
news
of
our
father
we
embarked
for
genoa
where
my
mother
went
to
gather
what
remained
of
a
family
estate
which
had
been
much
disputed
leaving
her
unjust
relatives
she
came
here
where
she
has
lived
but
a
weary
life
ans
o
heaven
how
wonderful
are
thy
doings
and
how
true
it
is
that
it
only
belongs
to
thee
to
work
miracles

the
joy

happy

years

dead
was
preparing
after
long
journeys
to
seek
the
consolations
of
a
new
family
in
marrying
a
gentle
and
virtuous
woman
the
little
security
there
was
for
my
life
