the
rise
and
fall
of
the
confederate
government
volume
one
of
two
by
jefferson
davis
preface
the
object
of
this
work
has
been
from
historical
data
to
show
that
the
southern
states
had
rightfully
the
power
to
withdraw
from
a
union
into
which
they
had
as
sovereign
communities
voluntarily
entered
that
the
denial
of
that
right
was
a
violation
of
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
compact
between
the
states
and
that
the
war
waged
by
the
federal
government
against
the
seceding
states
was
in
disregard
of
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
and
destructive
of
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
the
author
from
his
official
position
may
claim
to
have
known
much
of
the
motives
and
acts
of
his
countrymen
immediately
before
and
during
the
war
of
and
he
has
sought
to
furnish
material
far
the
future
historian
who
when
the
passions
and
prejudices
of
the
day
shall
have
given
place
to
reason
and
sober
thought
may
better
than
a
contemporary
investigate
the
causes
conduct
and
results
of
the
war
the
incentive
to
undertake
the
work
now
offered
to
the
public
was
the
desire
to
correct
misapprehensions
created
by
industriously
circulated
misrepresentations
as
to
the
acts
and
purposes
of
the
people
and
the
general
government
of
the
confederate
states
by
the
reiteration
of
such
unappropriate
terms
as
rebellion
and
treason
and
the
asseveration
that
the
south
was
levying
war
against
the
united
states
those
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
union
and
of
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
have
been
led
to
believe
that
the
confederate
states
were
in
the
condition
of
revolted
provinces
and
that
the
united
states
were
forced
to
resort
to
arms
for
the
preservation
of
their
existence
to
those
who
knew
that
the
union
was
formed
for
specific
enumerated
purposes
and
that
the
states
had
never
surrendered
their
sovereignty
it
was
a
palpable
absurdity
to
apply
to
them
or
to
their
citizens
when
obeying
their
mandates
the
terms
rebellion
and
treason
and
further
it
is
shown
in
the
following
pages
that
the
confederate
states
so
far
from
making
war
or
seeking
to
destroy
the
united
states
as
soon
as
they
had
an
official
organ
strove
earnestly
by
peaceful
recognition
to
equitably
adjust
all
questions
growing
out
of
the
separation
from
their
late
associates
another
great
perversion
of
truth
has
been
the
arraignment
of
the
men
who
participated
in
the
formation
of
the
confederacy
and
who
bore
arms
in
its
defense
as
the
instigators
of
a
controversy
leading
to
disunion
sectional
issues
appear
conspicuously
in
the
debates
of
the
convention
which
framed
the
federal
constitution
and
its
many
compromises
were
designed
to
secure
an
equilibrium
between
the
sections
and
to
preserve
the
interests
as
well
as
the
liberties
of
the
several
states
african
servitude
at
that
time
was
not
confined
to
a
section
but
was
numerically
greater
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
with
a
tendency
to
its
continuance
in
the
former
and
cessation
in
the
latter
it
therefore
thus
early
presents
itself
as
a
disturbing
element
and
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
were
known
to
be
necessary
for
its
adoption
bound
all
the
states
to
recognize
and
protect
that
species
of
property
when
at
a
subsequent
period
there
arose
in
the
northern
states
an
antislavery
agitation
it
was
a
harmless
and
scarcely
noticed
movement
until
political
demagogues
seized
upon
it
as
a
means
to
acquire
power
had
it
been
left
to
and
fanatics
most
zealous
where
least
informed
it
never
could
have
shaken
the
foundations
of
the
union
and
have
incited
one
section
to
carry
fire
and
sword
into
the
other
that
the
agitation
was
political
in
its
character
and
was
clearly
developed
as
early
as
it
is
believed
has
been
established
in
these
pages
to
preserve
a
sectional
equilibrium
and
to
maintain
the
equality
of
the
states
was
the
effort
on
one
side
to
acquire
empire
was
the
manifest
purpose
on
the
other
this
struggle
began
before
the
men
of
the
confederacy
were
born
how
it
arose
and
how
it
progressed
it
has
been
attempted
briefly
to
show
its
last
stage
was
on
the
question
of
territorial
governments
and
if
in
this
work
it
has
not
been
demonstrated
that
the
position
of
the
south
was
justified
by
the
constitution
and
the
equal
rights
of
the
people
of
all
the
states
it
must
be
because
the
author
has
failed
to
present
the
subject
with
a
sufficient
degree
of
force
and
clearness
in
describing
the
events
of
the
war
space
has
not
permitted
and
the
loss
of
both
books
and
papers
has
prevented
the
notice
of
very
many
entitled
to
consideration
as
well
for
the
humanity
as
the
gallantry
of
our
men
in
the
unequal
combats
they
fought
these
numerous
omissions
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
the
official
reports
made
at
the
time
and
the
subsequent
contributions
which
have
been
and
are
being
published
by
the
actors
will
supply
more
fully
and
graphically
than
could
have
been
done
in
this
work
usurpations
of
the
federal
government
have
been
presented
not
in
a
spirit
of
hostility
but
as
a
warning
to
the
people
against
the
dangers
by
which
their
liberties
are
beset
when
the
war
ceased
the
pretext
on
which
it
had
been
waged
could
no
longer
be
alleged
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
lincoln
which
when
it
was
issued
he
humorously
admitted
to
be
a
nullity
had
acquired
validity
by
the
action
of
the
highest
authority
known
to
our
institutions
the
people
assembled
in
their
several
state
conventions
the
soldiers
of
the
confederacy
had
laid
down
their
arms
had
in
good
faith
pledged
themselves
to
abstain
from
further
hostile
operations
and
had
peacefully
dispersed
to
their
homes
there
could
not
then
have
been
further
dread
of
them
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
plea
of
necessity
could
therefore
no
longer
exist
for
hostile
demonstration
against
the
people
and
states
of
the
deceased
confederacy
did
vengeance
which
stops
at
the
grave
subside
did
real
peace
and
the
restoration
of
the
states
to
their
former
rights
and
positions
follow
as
was
promised
on
the
restoration
of
the
union
let
the
recital
of
the
invasion
of
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
or
the
people
and
the
perversion
of
the
republican
form
of
government
guaranteed
to
each
state
by
the
constitution
answer
the
question
for
the
deplorable
fact
of
the
war
for
the
cruel
manner
in
which
it
was
waged
for
the
sad
physical
and
yet
sadder
moral
results
it
produced
the
reader
of
these
pages
i
hope
will
admit
that
the
south
in
the
forum
of
conscience
stands
fully
acquitted
much
of
the
past
is
irremediable
the
best
hope
for
a
restoration
in
the
future
to
the
pristine
purity
and
fraternity
of
the
union
rests
on
the
opinions
and
character
of
the
men
who
are
to
succeed
this
generation
that
they
maybe
suited
to
that
blessed
work
one
whose
public
course
is
ended
invokes
them
to
draw
their
creed
from
the
fountains
of
our
political
history
rather
than
from

introduction
a
duty
to
my
countrymen
to
the
memory
of
those
who
died
in
defense
of
a
cause
consecrated
by
inheritance
as
well
as
sustained
by
conviction
and
to
those
who
perhaps
less
fortunate
staked
all
and
lost
all
save
life
and
honor
in
its
behalf
has
impelled
me
to
attempt
the
vindication
of
their
cause
and
conduct
for
this
purpose
i
have
decided
to
present
an
historical
sketch
of
the
events
which
preceded
and
attended
the
struggle
of
the
southern
states
to
maintain
their
existence
and
their
rights
as
sovereign
communities
the
creators
not
the
creatures
of
the
general
government
the
social
problem
of
maintaining
the
just
relation
between
constitution
government
and
people
has
been
found
so
difficult
that
human
history
is
a
record
of
unsuccessful
efforts
to
establish
it
a
government
to
afford
the
needful
protection
and
exercise
proper
care
for
the
welfare
of
a
people
must
have
homogeneity
in
its
constituents
it
is
this
necessity
which
has
divided
the
human
race
into
separate
nations
and
finally
has
defeated
the
grandest
efforts
which
conquerors
have
made
to
give
unlimited
extent
to
their
domain
when
our
fathers
dissolved
their
connection
with
great
britain
by
declaring
themselves
free
and
independent
states
they
constituted
thirteen
separate
communities
and
were
careful
to
assert
and
preserve
each
for
itself
its
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
at
a
time
when
the
minds
of
men
are
straying
far
from
the
lessons
our
fathers
taught
it
seems
proper
and
well
to
recur
to
the
original
principles
on
which
the
system
of
government
they
devised
was
founded
the
eternal
truths
which
they
announced
the
rights
which
they
declared
are
the
on
which
rests
the
vindication
of
the
confederate
cause
he
must
have
been
a
careless
reader
of
our
political
history
who
has
not
observed
that
whether
under
the
style
of
united
colonies
or
united
states
which
was
adopted
after
the
declaration
of
independence
whether
under
the
articles
of
confederation
or
the
compact
of
union
there
everywhere
appears
the
distinct
assertion
of
state
sovereignty
and
nowhere
the
slightest
suggestion
of
any
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
states
to
consolidate
themselves
into
one
body
will
any
candid
man
assert
that
at
any
time
between
and
a
proposition
to
surrender
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
merge
them
in
a
central
government
would
have
had
the
least
possible
chance
of
adoption
can
any
historical
fact
be
more
demonstrable
than
that
the
states
did
both
in
the
confederation
and
in
the
union
retain
their
sovereignty
and
independence
as
distinct
communities
voluntarily
consenting
to
federation
but
never
becoming
the
fractional
parts
of
a
nation
that
such
opinions
should
find
adherents
in
our
day
may
be
attributable
to
the
natural
law
of
aggregation
surely
not
to
a
conscientious
regard
for
the
terms
of
the
compact
for
union
by
the
states
in
all
free
governments
the
constitution
or
organic
law
is
supreme
over
the
government
and
in
our
federal
union
this
was
most
distinctly
marked
by
limitations
and
prohibitions
against
all
which
was
beyond
the
expressed
grants
of
power
to
the
general
government
in
the
foreground
therefore
i
take
the
position
that
those
who
resisted
violations
of
the
compact
were
the
true
friends
and
those
who
maintained
the
usurpation
of
undelegated
powers
were
the
real
enemies
of
the
constitutional

the
true
nature

character
of
those
questions

which
it

and
the
misconceptions
which
have
prevailed
in
our
own
country
and
still
more
among
foreigners
remote
from
the
field
of
contention
are
likely
to
be
perpetuated
in
the
mind
of
posterity
unless
corrected
before
they
become
crystallized
by
tacit
acquiescence
it
is
well
known
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
african
servitude
existed
in
all
the
states
that
were
parties
to
that
compact
unless
with
the
single
exception
of
massachusetts
in
which
it
had
perhaps
very
recently
ceased
to
exist
the
slaves
however
were
numerous
in
the
southern
and
very
few
in
the
northern
states
this
diversity
was
occasioned
by
differences
of
climate
soil
and
industrial
interests
not
in
any
degree
by
moral
considerations
which
at
that
period
were
not
recognized
as
an
element
in
the
question
it
was
simply
because
negro
labor
was
more
profitable
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
that
the
importation
of
negro
slaves
had
been
and
continued
to
be
chiefly
directed
to
the
southern
ports
for
the
same
reason
slavery
was
abolished
by
the
states
of
the
northern
section
though
it
existed
in
several
of
them
for
more
than
fifty
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
while
the
importation
of
slaves
into
the
south
continued
to
be
carried
on
by
northern
merchants
and
northern
ships
without
interference
in
the
traffic
from
any
quarter
until
it
was
prohibited
by
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
southern
states
themselves
the
constitution
expressly
forbade
any
interference
by
congress
with
the
or
to
use
its
own
language
with
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
should
think
proper
to
admit
prior
to
the
year
during
the
intervening
period
of
more
than
twenty
years
the
matter
was
exclusively
under
the
control
of
the
respective
states
nevertheless
every
southern
state
without
exception
either
had
already
enacted
or
proceeded
to
enact
laws
forbidding
the
importation
of
slaves
virginia
was
the
first
of
all
the
states
north
or
south
to
prohibit
it
and
georgia
was
the
first
to
incorporate
such
a
prohibition
in
her
organic
constitution
two
petitions
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
were
presented
february
and
to
the
very
first
congress
convened
under
the
constitution
after
full
discussion
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
determined
with
regard
to
the
subject
that
congress
have
no
authority
to
interfere
in
the
emancipation
of
slaves
or
in
the
treatment
of
them
within
any
of
the
states
and
with
regard
to
the
other
that
no
authority
existed
to
prohibit
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
the
states
might
think
proper
to
admit
prior
to
the
year
so
distinct
and
final
was
this
statement
of
the
limitations
of
the
authority
of
congress
considered
to
be
that
when
a
similar
petition
was
presented
two
or
three
years
afterward
the
clerk
of
the
house
was
instructed
to
return
it
to
the
petitioner
in
congress
availing
itself
of
the
very
earliest
moment
at
which
the
constitutional
restriction
ceased
to
be
operative
passed
an
act
prohibiting
the
importation
of
slaves
into
any
part
of
the
united
states
from
and
after
the
first
day
of
january
this
act
was
passed
with
great
unanimity
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
were
one
hundred
and
thirteen
yeas
to
five
nays
and
it
is
a
significant
fact
as
showing
the
absence
of
any
sectional
division
of
sentiment
at
that
period
that
the
five
dissentients
were
divided
as
equally
as
possible
between
the
two
sections
two
of
them
were
from
northern
and
three
from
southern
states
the
had
thus
been
finally
abolished
some
months
before
the
birth
of
the
author
of
these
pages
and
has
never
since
had
legal
existence
in
any
of
the
united
states
the
question
of
the
maintenance
or
extinction
of
the
system
of
negro
servitude
already
existing
in
any
state
was
one
exclusively
belonging
to
such
state
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
no
subsequent
question
legitimately
arising
in
federal
legislation
could
properly
have
any
reference
to
the
merits
or
the
policy
of
the
institution
itself
a
few
zealots
in
the
north
afterward
created
much
agitation
by
demands
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
within
the
states
by
federal
intervention
and
by
their
activity
and
perseverance
finally
became
a
recognized
party
which
holding
the
balance
of
power
between
the
two
contending
organizations
in
that
section
gradually
obtained
the
control
of
one
and
to
no
small
degree
corrupted
the
other
the
dominant
idea
however
at
least
of
the
absorbed
party
was
sectional
aggrandizement
looking
to
absolute
control
and
theirs
is
the
responsibility
for
the
war
that
resulted
no
moral
nor
sentimental
considerations
were
really
involved
in
either
the
earlier
or
later
controversies
which
so
long
agitated
and
finally
ruptured
the
union
they
were
simply
struggles
between
different
sections
with
diverse
institutions
and
interests
it
is
absolutely
requisite
in
order
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
history
of
the
country
to
bear
these
truths
clearly
in
mind
the
phraseology
of
the
period
referred
to
will
otherwise
be
essentially
deceptive
the
antithetical
employment
of
such
terms
as
and
or
and
with
reference
to
the
principles
and
purposes
of
contending
parties
or
rival
sections
has
had
immense
influence
in
misleading
the
opinions
and
sympathies
of
the
world
the
idea
of
freedom
is
captivating
that
of
slavery
repellent
to
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
in
general
it
is
easy
therefore
to
understand
the
effect
of
applying
the
one
set
of
terms
to
one
party
the
other
to
another
in
a
contest
which
had
no
just
application
whatever
to
the
essential
merits
of
freedom
or
slavery
southern
statesmen
may
perhaps
have
been
too
indifferent
to
this
consideration
in
their
ardent
pursuit
of
principles
overlooking
the
effects
of
phrases
this
is
especially
true
with
regard
to
that
familiar
but
most
fallacious
expression
the
extension
of
slavery
to
the
reader
unfamiliar
with
the
subject
or
viewing
it
only
on
the
surface
it
would
perhaps
never
occur
that
as
used
in
the
great
controversies
respecting
the
territories
of
the
united
states
it
does
not
never
did
and
never
could
imply
the
addition
of
a
single
slave
to
the
number
already
existing
the
question
was
merely
whether
the
slaveholder
should
be
permitted
to
go
with
his
slaves
into
territory
the
common
property
of
all
into
which
the
could
go
with
property
of
any
sort
there
was
no
proposal
nor
desire
on
the
part
of
the
southern
states
to
reopen
the
which
they
had
been
foremost
in
suppressing
or
to
add
to
the
number
of
slaves
it
was
a
question
of
the
distribution
or
dispersion
of
the
slaves
rather
than
of
the
extension
of
slavery
removal
is
not
extension
indeed
if
emancipation
was
the
end
to
be
desired
the
dispersion
of
the
negroes
over
a
wider
area
among
additional
territories
eventually
to
become
states
and
in
climates
unfavorable
to
instead
of
hindering
would
have
promoted
this
object
by
diminishing
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
ultimate
emancipation
the
distinction
here
defined
between
the
distribution
or
dispersion
of
slaves
and
the
extension
of
slavery
two
things
altogether
different
although
so
generally
confounded
was
early
and
clearly
drawn
under
circumstances
and
in
a
connection
which
justify
a
fuller
notice
virginia
it
is
well
known
in
the
year
ceded
to
the
united
states
then
united
only
by
the
original
articles
of
confederation
her
vast
possessions
northwest
of
the
ohio
from
which
the
great
states
of
ohio
indiana
michigan
illinois
wisconsin
and
part
of
minnesota
have
since
been
formed
in
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
the
celebrated
ordinance
for
the
government
of
this
northwestern
territory
was
adopted
by
the
congress
with
the
full
consent
and
indeed
at
the
express
instance
of
virginia
this
ordinance
included
six
definite
articles
of
compact
between
the
original
states
and
the
people
and
states
in
the
said
territory
which
were
to
for
ever
remain
unalterable
unless
by
common
consent
the
sixth
of
these
articles
ordains
that
there
shall
be
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
in
the
said
territory
otherwise
than
in
the
punishment
of
crimes
whereof
the
party
shall
have
been
duly
convicted
in
december
a
petition
of
the
legislative
council
and
house
of
representatives
of
the
indiana
territory
then
comprising
all
the
area
now
occupied
by
the
states
of
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
was
presented
to
congress
it
appears
from
the
proceedings
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
several
petitions
of
the
same
purport
from
inhabitants
of
the
territory
accompanied
by
a
letter
from
william
henry
harrison
the
governor
afterward
president
of
the
united
states
had
been
under
consideration
nearly
two
years
earlier
the
prayer
of
these
petitions
was
for
a
of
the
sixth
article
of
the
ordinance
so
as
to
permit
the
introduction
of
slaves
into
the
territory
the
whole
subject
was
referred
to
a
select
committee
of
seven
members
consisting
of
representatives
from
virginia
ohio
pennsylvania
south
carolina
kentucky
and
new
york
and
the
delegate
from
the
indiana
territory
on
the
of
the
ensuing
february
this
committee
made
a
report
favorable
to
the
prayer
of
the
petitioners
and
recommending
a
suspension
of
the
prohibitory
article
for
ten
years
in
their
report
the
committee
after
stating
their
opinion
that
a
qualified
suspension
of
the
article
in
question
would
be
beneficial
to
the
people
of
the
indiana
territory
proceeded
to
say
the
suspension
of
this
article
is
an
object
almost
universally
desired
in
that
territory
it
appears
to
your
committee
to
be
a
question
entirely
different
from
that
between
slavery
and
freedom
inasmuch
as
it
would
merely
occasion
the
removal
of
persons
already
slaves
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
the
good
effects
of
this
suspension
in
the
present
instance
would
be
to
accelerate
the
population
of
that
territory
hitherto
retarded
by
the
operation
of
that
article
of
compact
as
slaveholders
emigrating
into
the
western
country
might
then
indulge
any
preference
which
they
might
feel
for
a
settlement
in
the
indiana
territory
instead
of
seeking
as
they
are
now
compelled
to
do
settlements
in
other
states
or
countries
permitting
the
introduction
of
slaves
the
condition
of
the
slaves
themselves
would
be
much
ameliorated
by
it
as
it
is
evident
from
experience
that
the
more
they
are
separated
and
diffused
the
more
care
and
attention
are
bestowed
on
them
by
their
masters
each
proprietor
having
it
in
his
power
to
increase
their
comforts
and
conveniences
in
proportion
to
the
smallness
of
their
numbers
these
were
the
dispassionate
utterances
of
representatives
of
every
part
of
the
union
men
contemporary
with
the
origin
of
the
constitution
speaking
before
any
sectional
division
had
arisen
in
connection
with
the
subject
it
is
remarkable
that
the
very
same
opinions
which
they
express
and
arguments
which
they
adduce
had
fifty
years
afterward
come
to
be
denounced
and
repudiated
by
one
half
of
the
union
as
partisan
and
sectional
when
propounded
by
the
other
half
no
final
action
seems
to
have
been
taken
on
the
subject
before
the
adjournment
of
congress
but
it
was
brought
forward
at
the
next
session
in
a
more
imposing
form
on
the
of
january
the
speaker
laid
before
the
house
of
representatives
a
letter
from
governor
harrison
inclosing
certain
resolutions
formally
and
adopted
by
the
legislative
council
and
house
of
representatives
of
the
indiana
territory
in
favor
of
the
suspension
of
the
sixth
article
of
the
ordinance
and
the
introduction
of
slaves
into
the
territory
which
they
say
would
meet
the
approbation
of
at
least
nine
tenths
of
the
good
citizens
of
the
same
among
the
resolutions
were
the
following
that
the
abstract
question
of
liberty
and
slavery
is
not
considered
as
involved
in
a
suspension
of
the
said
article
inasmuch
as
the
number
of
slaves
in
the
united
states
not
be
by
this
measure
that
the
suspension
of
the
said
article
would
be
equally
advantageous
to
the
territory
to
the
states
from
whence
the
negroes
would
be
brought
and
to
the
negroes
themselves
the
states
which
are
overburdened
with
negroes
would
be
benefited
by
their
citizens
having
an
opportunity
of
disposing
of
the
negroes
which
they
can
not
comfortably
support
or
of
removing
with
them
to
a
country
abounding
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
and
the
negro
himself
would
exchange
a
scanty
pittance
of
the
coarsest
food
for
a
plentiful
and
nourishing
diet
and
a
situation
which
admits
not
the
most
distant
prospect
of
emancipation
for
one
which
presents
no
considerable
obstacle
to
his
wishes
these
resolutions
were
submitted
to
a
committee
drawn
like
the
former
from
different
sections
of
the
country
which
again
reported
favorably
reiterating
in
substance
the
reasons
given
by
the
former
committee
their
report
was
sustained
by
the
house
and
a
resolution
to
suspend
the
prohibitory
article
was
adopted
the
proposition
failed
however
in
the
senate
and
there
the
matter
seems
to
have
been
dropped
the
proceedings
constitute
a
significant
and
instructive
episode
in
the
political
history
of
the
country
the
allusion
which
has
been
made
to
the
ordinance
of
renders
it
proper
to
notice
very
briefly
the
argument
put
forward
during
the
discussion
of
the
missouri
question
and
often
repeated
since
that
the
ordinance
afforded
a
precedent
in
support
of
the
claim
of
a
power
in
congress
to
determine
the
question
of
the
admission
of
slaves
into
the
territories
and
in
justification
of
the
prohibitory
clause
applied
in
to
a
portion
of
the
louisiana
territory
the
difference
between
the
congress
of
the
confederation
and
that
of
the
federal
constitution
is
so
broad
that
the
action
of
the
former
can
in
no
just
sense
be
taken
as
a
precedent
for
the
latter
the
congress
of
the
confederation
represented
the
states
in
their
sovereignty
each
delegation
having
one
vote
so
that
all
the
states
were
of
equal
weight
in
the
decision
of
any
question
it
had
legislative
executive
and
in
some
degree
judicial
powers
thus
combining
all
departments
of
government
in
itself
during
its
recess
a
committee
known
as
the
committee
of
the
states
exercised
the
powers
of
the
congress
which
was
in
spirit
if
not
in
fact
an
assemblage
of
the
states
on
the
other
hand
the
congress
of
the
constitution
is
only
the
legislative
department
of
the
general
government
with
powers
strictly
defined
and
expressly
limited
to
those
delegated
by
the
states
it
is
further
held
in
check
by
an
executive
and
a
judiciary
and
consists
of
two
branches
each
having
peculiar
and
specified
functions
if
then
it
be
admitted
which
is
at
least
very
questionable
that
the
congress
of
the
confederation
had
rightfully
the
power
to
exclude
slave
property
from
the
territory
northwest
of
the
ohio
river
that
power
must
have
been
derived
from
its
character
as
an
assemblage
of
the
sovereign
states
not
from
the
articles
of
confederation
in
which
no
indication
of
the
grant
of
authority
to
exercise
such
a
function
can
be
found
the
congress
of
the
constitution
is
expressly
prohibited
from
the
assumption
of
any
power
not
distinctly
and
specifically
delegated
to
it
as
the
legislative
branch
of
an
organized
government
what
was
questionable
in
the
former
case
therefore
becomes
clearly
inadmissible
in
the
latter
but
there
is
yet
another
material
distinction
to
be
observed
the
states
owners
of
what
was
called
the
northwestern
territory
were
component
members
of
the
congress
which
adopted
the
ordinance
for
its
government
and
gave
thereto
their
full
and
free
consent
the
ordinance
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
virtually
a
treaty
between
the
states
which
ceded
and
those
which
received
that
extensive
domain
in
the
other
case
missouri
and
the
whole
region
affected
by
the
missouri
compromise
were
parts
of
the
territory
acquired
from
france
under
the
name
of
louisiana
and
as
it
requires
two
parties
to
make
or
amend
a
treaty
france
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
have
coöperated
in
any
amendment
of
the
treaty
by
which
louisiana
had
been
acquired
and
which
guaranteed
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
ceded
territory
all
the
rights
advantages
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
liberty
property
and
the
religion
they
profess
state
papers
vol
ii
foreign
relations
p
for
all
the
reasons
thus
stated
it
seems
to
me
conclusive
that
the
action
of
the
congress
of
the
confederation
in
could
not
constitute
a
precedent
to
justify
the
action
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
and
that
the
prohibitory
clause
of
the
missouri
compromise
was
without
constitutional
authority
in
violation
of
the
rights
of
a
part
of
the
joint
owners
of
the
territory
and
in
disregard
of
the
obligations
of
the
treaty
with
france
the
basis
of
sectional
controversy
was
the
question
of
the
balance
of
political
power
in
its
earlier
manifestations
this
was
undisguised
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
territory
from
france
in
and
the
subsequent
admission
of
a
portion
of
that
territory
into
the
union
as
a
state
afforded
one
of
the
earliest
occasions
for
the
manifestation
of
sectional
jealousy
and
gave
rise
to
the
first
threats
or
warnings
which
proceeded
from
new
england
of
a
dissolution
of
the
union
yet
although
negro
slavery
existed
in
louisiana
no
pretext
was
made
of
that
as
an
objection
to
the
acquisition
the
ground
of
opposition
is
frankly
stated
in
a
letter
of
that
period
from
one
massachusetts
statesman
to
another
that
the
influence
of
part
of
the
union
must
be
diminished
by
the
acquisition
of
more
weight
at
the
other
extremity
some
years
afterward
in
occurred
the
memorable
contest
with
regard
to
the
admission
into
the
union
of
missouri
the
second
state
carved
out
of
the
louisiana
territory
the
controversy
arose
out
of
a
proposition
to
attach
to
the
admission
of
the
new
state
a
proviso
prohibiting
slavery
or
involuntary
servitude
therein
the
vehement
discussion
that
ensued
was
continued
into
the
first
session
of
a
different
congress
from
that
in
which
it
originated
and
agitated
the
whole
country
during
the
interval
between
the
two
it
was
the
first
question
that
ever
seriously
threatened
the
stability
of
the
union
and
the
first
in
which
the
sentiment
of
opposition
to
slavery
in
the
abstract
was
introduced
as
an
adjunct
of
sectional
controversy
it
was
clearly
shown
in
debate
that
such
considerations
were
altogether
irrelevant
that
the
number
of
existing
slaves
would
not
be
affected
by
their
removal
from
the
older
states
to
missouri
and
moreover
that
the
proposed
restriction
would
be
contrary
to
the
spirit
if
not
to
the
letter
of
the
constitution
notwithstanding
all
this
the
restriction
was
adopted
by
a
vote
almost
strictly
sectional
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
failed
in
the
senate
through
the
firm
resistance
of
the
southern
aided
by
a
few
patriotic
and
conservative
northern
members
of
that
body
the
admission
of
the
new
state
without
any
restriction
was
finally
accomplished
by
the
addition
to
the
bill
of
a
section
for
ever
prohibiting
slavery
in
all
that
portion
of
the
louisiana
territory
lying
north
of
degrees
and
thirty
minutes
north
latitude
except
missouri
by
implication
leaving
the
portion
south
of
that
line
open
to
settlement
either
with
or
without
slaves
this
provision
as
an
offset
to
the
admission
of
the
new
state
without
restriction
constituted
the
celebrated
missouri
compromise
it
was
reluctantly
accepted
by
a
small
majority
of
the
southern
members
nearly
half
of
them
voted
against
it
under
the
conviction
that
it
was
unauthorized
by
the
constitution
and

some

of

this
brief

may
have
sufficed
to
show
that
the
question
of
the
right
or
wrong
of
the
institution
of
slavery
was
in
no
wise
involved
in
the
earlier
sectional
controversies
nor
was
it
otherwise
in
those
of
a
later
period
in
which
it
was
the
lot
of
the
author
of
these
memoirs
to
bear
a
part
they
were
essentially
struggles
for
sectional
equality
or
ascendancy
for
the
maintenance
or
the
destruction
of
that
balance
of
power
or
equipoise
between
north
and
south
which
was
early
recognized
as
a
cardinal
principle
in
our
federal
system
it
does
not
follow
that
both
parties
to
this
contest
were
wholly
right
or
wholly
wrong
in
their
claims
the
determination
of
the
question
of
right
or
wrong
must
be
left
to
the
candid
inquirer
after
examination
of
the
evidence
the
object
of
these
preliminary
investigations
has
been
to
clear
the
subject
of
the
obscurity
produced
by
irrelevant

the
glamour
of

required
legislation
by

in

the
bills
reported
by

were
referred
to
a
select
committee
of
which
clay
the
distinguished
senator
from

was
chairman
from
this
committee
emanated
the
bills
which
taken
together
are
known
as

with

advocated

of

acquired
territory
by
an
extension
to
the

ocean
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
of
degrees
and
thirty
minutes
north
latitude
this
was
not
because
of
any
inherent
merit
or
fitness
in
that
line
but
because
it
had
been
accepted
by
the
country
as
a
settlement
of
the
sectional
question
which
thirty
years
before
had
threatened
a
rupture
of
the
union
and
it
had
acquired
in
the
public
mind
a
prescriptive
respect
which
it
seemed
unwise
to
disregard
a
majority
however
decided
otherwise
and
the
line
of
political
conciliation
was
then
obliterated
as
far
as
it
lay
in
the
power
of
congress
to
do
so
an
analysis
of
the
vote
will
show
that
this
result
was
effected
almost
exclusively
by
the
representatives
of
the
north
and
that
the
south
was
not
responsible
for
an
action
which
proved
to
be
the
opening
of
pandora
box
however
objectionable
it
may
have
been
in
to
adopt
that
political
line
as
expressing
a
geographical
definition
of
different
sectional
interests
and
however
it
may
be
condemned
as
the
assumption
by
congress
of
a
function
not
delegated
to
it
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
act
had
received
such
recognition
and
by
the
people
of
the
states
as
to
give
it
a
value
which
it
did
not
originally
possess
pacification
had
been
the
fruit
borne
by
the
tree
and
it
should
not
have
been
recklessly
hewed
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
the
frequent
assertion
then
made
was
that
all
discrimination
was
unjust
and
that
the
popular
will
should
be
left
untrammeled
in
the
formation
of
new
states
this
theory
was
good
enough
in
itself
and
as
an
abstract
proposition
could
not
be
gainsaid
but
its
practical
operation
has
but
poorly
sustained
the
expectations
of
its
advocates
as
will
be
seen
when
we
come
to
consider
the
events
that
occurred
a
few
years
later
in
kansas
and
elsewhere
retrospectively
viewed
under
the
mellowing
light
of
time
and
with
the
calm
consideration
we
can
usually
give
to
the
irremediable
past
the
compromise
legislation
of
bears
the
impress
of
that
sectional
spirit
so
widely
at
variance
with
the
general
purposes
of
the
union
and
so
destructive
of
the
harmony
and
mutual
benefit
which
the
constitution
was
intended
to
secure
the
refusal
to
divide
the
territory
acquired
from
mexico
by
an
extension
of
the
line
of
the
missouri
compromise
to
the
pacific
was
a
consequence
of
the
purpose
to
admit
california
as
a
state
of
the
union
before
it
had
acquired
the
requisite
population
and
while
it
was
mainly
under
the
control
of
a
military
organization
sent
from
new
york
during
the
war
with
mexico
and
disbanded
in
california
upon
the
restoration
of
peace
the
inconsistency
of
the
argument
against
the
extension
of
the
line
was
exhibited
in
the
division
of
the
territory
of
texas
by
that
parallel
and
payment
to
the
state
of
money
to
secure
her
consent
to
the
partition
of
her
domain
in
the
case
of
texas
the
north
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
by
the
application
of
the
practice
of
geographical
compromise
on
an
arbitrary
line
in
the
case
of
california
the
conditions
were
reversed
the
south
might
have
been
the
gainer
and
the
north
the
loser
by
a
recognition
of
the
same
rule
the
compensation
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
south
received
was
a
more
effective
law
for
the
rendition
of
fugitives
from
service
or
labor
but
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
this
law
provided
for
the
execution
by
the
general
government
of
obligations
which
had
been
imposed
by
the
federal
compact
upon
the
several
states
of
the
union
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
a
fulfillment
of
that
law
would
be
small
in
comparison
with
the
evil
to
result
from
the
plausible
pretext
that
the
states
had
thus
been
relieved
from
a
duty
which
they
had
assumed
in
the
adoption
of
the
compact
of
union
whatever
tended
to
lead
the
people
of
any
of
the
states
to
feel
that
they
could
be
relieved
from
their
constitutional
obligations
by
transferring
them
to
the
general
government
or
that
they
might
thus
or
otherwise
evade
or
resist
them
could
not
fail
to
be
like
the
tares
which
the
enemy
sowed
amid
the
wheat
the
union
of
states
formed
to
secure
the
permanent
welfare
of
posterity
and
to
promote
harmony
among
the
constituent
states
could
not
without
changing
its
character
survive
such
alienation
as
rendered
its
parts
hostile
to
the
security
prosperity
and
happiness
of
one
another
it
was
reasonably
argued
that
as
the
legislatures
of
fourteen
of
the
states
had
enacted
what
were
termed
personal
liberty
laws
which
forbade
the
coöperation
of
state
officials
in
the
rendition
of
fugitives
from
service
and
labor
it
became
necessary
that
the
general
government
should
provide
the
requisite
machinery
for
the
execution
of
the
law
the
result
proved
what
might
have
been
anticipated
that
those
communities
which
had
repudiated
their
constitutional
obligations
which
had
nullified
a
previous
law
of
congress
for
the
execution
of
a
provision
of
the
constitution
and
had
murdered
men
who
came
peacefully
to
recover
their
property
would
evade
or
obstruct
so
as
to
render
practically
worthless
law
that
could
be
enacted
for
that
purpose
in
the
exceptional
cases
in
which
it
might
be
executed
the
event
would
be
attended
with
such
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
authorities
as
to
produce
consequent
evils
greater
than
those
it
was
intended
to
correct
it
was
during
the
progress
of
these
memorable
controversies

the

i
liked
it
better

then
suggested
that

should
join

that
it
was

measure

thought
would
probably
give

on

on

return
to

in
the
subject
chiefly
agitating
the
public
mind
was
that
of
the
compromise
measures
of
the
previous
year
consequent
upon
these
was
a
proposition
for
a
convention
of
delegates
from
the
people
of
the
southern
states
respectively
to
consider
what
steps
ought
to
be
taken
for
their
future
peace
and
safety
and
the
preservation
of
their
constitutional
rights
there
was
diversity
of
opinion
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
measures
referred
to
but
the
disagreement
no
longer
followed
the
usual
lines
of
party
division
they
who
saw
in
those
measures
the
forerunner
of
disaster
to
the
south
had
no
settled
policy
beyond
a
convention
the
object
of
which
should
be
to
devise
new
and
more
effectual
guarantees
against
the
perils
of
usurpation
they
were
unjustly
charged
with
a
desire
to
destroy
the
union
a
feeling
entertained
by
few
very
few
if
by
any
in
mississippi
and
avowed
by
none
there
were
many
however
who
held
that
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
purposes
for
which
the
union
was
formed
were
of
higher
value
than
the
mere
union
itself
independence
existed
before
the
compact
of
union
between
the
states
and
if
that
compact
should
be
broken
in
part
and
therefore
destroyed
in
whole
it
was
hoped
that
the
liberties
of
the
people
in
the
states
might
still
be
preserved
those
who
were
most
devoted
to
the
union
of
the
constitution
might
consequently
be
expected
to
resist
most
sternly
any
usurpation
of
undelegated
power
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
warp
the
federal
government
from
its
proper
character
and
by
sapping
the
foundation
to
destroy
the
union
of
the
states
my
recent
reëlection
to
the
united
states
senate
had
conferred
upon
me
for
six
years
longer
the
office
which
i
preferred
to
all
others
i
could
not
therefore
be
suspected
of
desiring
a
nomination
for
any
other
office
from
the
democratic
convention

meeting
of
which
was
then
drawing

as

on
the
measures
which
were
now
exciting
so
much
interest
in
the
public
mind
it
was
very
proper
that
i
should
visit
the
people
in
different
parts
of
the
state
and
render
an
account
of
my
stewardship
my
devotion
to
the
union
of
our
fathers
had
been
so
often
and
so
publicly
declared
i
had
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
so
defiantly
challenged
any
question
of
my
fidelity
to
it
my
services
civil
and
military
had
now
extended
through
so
long
a
period
and
were
so
generally
known
that
i
felt
quite
assured
that
no
whisperings
of
envy
or
ill
will
could
lead
the
people
of
mississippi
to
believe
that
i
had
dishonored
their
trust
by
using
the
power
they
had
conferred
on
me
to
destroy
the
government
to
which
i
was
accredited
then
as
afterward
i
regarded
the
separation
of
the
states
as
a
great
though
not
the
greatest
evil
i
returned
from
my
tour
among
the
people
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
meeting
of
the
nominating
convention
of
the
democratic
or
party
during
the
previous
year
the
governor
general
john
quitman
had
been
compelled
to
resign
his
office
to
answer
an
indictment
against
him
for
complicity
with
the
filibustering
expeditions
against
cuba
the
charges
were
not
sustained
many
of
the
democratic
party
of
mississippi
myself
included
recognized
a
consequent
obligation
to
renominate
him
for
the
office
of
which
he
had
been
deprived
when
however
the
delegates
met
in
party
convention
the
committee
appointed
to
select
candidates
on
comparison
of
opinions
concluded
that
in
view
of
the
effort
to
fix
upon
the
party
the
imputation
of
a
purpose
of
disunion
some
of
the
antecedents
of
general
quitman
might
endanger
success
a
proposition
was
therefore
made
in
the
committee
on
nominations
that
i
should
be
invited
to
become
a
candidate
and
that
if
general
quitman
would
withdraw
my
acceptance
of
the
nomination
and
the
resignation
of
my
place
in
the
united
states
senate
which
it
was
known
would
result
was
to
be
followed
by
the
appointment
by
the
governor
of
general
quitman
to
the
vacated
place
in
the
senate
i
offered
no
objection
to
this
arrangement
but
left
it
to
general
quitman
to
decide
he
claimed
the
nomination
for
the
governorship
or
nothing
and
was
so
nominated
to
promote
the
success
of
the
democratic
nominees
i
engaged
actively
in
the
canvass
and
continued
in
the
field
until
stricken
down
by
disease
this
occurred
just
before
the
election
of
delegates
to
a
state
convention
for
which
provision
had
been
made
by
the
legislature
and
the
canvass
for
which
conducted
in
the
main
upon
party
lines
was
in
progress
simultaneously
with
that
for
the
ordinary
state
officers
the
democratic
majority
in
the
state
when
the
canvass
began
was
estimated
at
eight
thousand
at
this
election
in
september
for
delegates
to
the
state
convention
we
were
beaten
by
about
seven
thousand
five
hundred
votes
seeing
in
this
result
the
foreshadowing
of
almost
inevitable
defeat
general
quitman
withdrew
from
the
canvass
as
a
candidate
and
the
executive
committee
of
the
party
empowered
to
fill
vacancies
called
on
me
to
take
his
place
my
health
did
not
permit
me
to
leave
home
at
that
time
and
only
about
six
weeks
remained
before
the
election
was
to
take
place
but
being
assured
that
i
was
not
expected
to
take
any
active
part
and
that
the
party
asked
only
the
use
of
my
name
i
consented
to
be
announced
and
immediately
resigned
from
the
united
states
senate
nevertheless
i
soon
afterward
took
the
field
in
person
and
worked
earnestly
until
the
day
of
election
i
was
defeated
but
the
majority
of
more
than
seven
thousand
votes
that
had
been
cast
a
short
time
before
against
the
party
with
which
i
was
associated
was
reduced
to
less
than
one
thousand
in
this
canvass
both
before
and
after
i
became
a
candidate
no
argument
or
appeal
of
mine
was
directed
against
the
perpetuation
of
the
union
believing
however
that
the
signs
of
the
time
portended
danger
to
the
south
from
the
usurpation
by
the
general
government
of
undelegated
powers
i
counseled
that
mississippi
should
enter
into
the
proposed
meeting
of
the
people
of
the
southern
states
to
consider
what
could
and
should
be
done
to
insure
our
future
safety
frankly
stating
my
conviction
that
unless
such
action
were
taken
then
sectional
rivalry
would
engender
greater
evils
in
the
future
and
that
if
the
controversy
was
postponed
the
last
opportunity
for
a
peaceful
solution
would
be
lost
then
the
issue
would
have
to
be
settled

blood

my

i
received

against
the
fate
accusation
of
disunionism

before
i
had
returned
to
you
the
thanks
to

i
received
this
day
the
joseph

marked
by
you
to
call
my
attention
to
an
article
in
answer
to
your
defense
which
was
just
in
all
things
save
your
too
complimentary
terms
i
wish
i
had
the
letter
quoted
from
that
you
might
publish
the
whole
of
that
which
is
garbled
to
answer
a
purpose
in
a

not
published
i
put
such
a
damper
on
the
attempt
to
fix
on
me
the
desire
to
break
up
our
union
and
presented
other
points
in
a
form
so
little
acceptable
to
the
unfriendly
inquirers
that
the
publication
of
the
letter
had
to
be
drawn
out
of
them
at
the
risk
of
being
wearisome
but
encouraged
by
your
marked
friendship
i
will
give
you
a
statement
in
the
case
the
meeting
of
october
was
a
convention
of
delegates
equally
representing
the
whig
and
democratic
parties
in
mississippi
the
resolutions
were
decisive
as
to
equality
of
right
in
the
south
with
the
north
to
the
territories
acquired
from
mexico
and
proposed
a
convention
of
the
southern
states
i
was
not
a
member
but
on
invitation
addressed
the
convention
the
succeeding
legislature
instructed
me
as
a
senator
to
assert
this
equality
and
under
the
existing
circumstances
to
resist
by
all
constitutional
means
the
admission
of
california
as
a
state
at
a
called
session
of
the
legislature
in
a
committee
called
on
me
by
letter
for
my
views
they
were
men
who
had
enacted
or
approved
the
resolutions
of
the
convention
of
and
instructed
me
as
members
of
the
legislature
in
regular
session
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
to
them
i
replied
that
i
adhered
to
the
policy
they
had
indicated
and
instructed
me
in
their
official
character
to
pursue
i
pointed
out
the
mode
in
which
their
policy
could
in
my
opinion
be
executed
without
bloodshed
or
disastrous
convulsion
but
in
terms
of
bitter
scorn
alluded
to
such
as
would
insult
me
with
a
desire
to
destroy
the
union
for
which
my
whole
life
proved
me
to
be
a
devotee
pardon
the
egotism
in
consideration
of
the
occasion
when
i
say
to
you
that
my
father
and
my
uncles
fought
through
the
revolution
of
giving
their
youth
their
blood
and
their
little
patrimony
to
the
constitutional
freedom
which
i
claim
as
my
inheritance
three
of
my
brothers
fought
in
the
war
of
two
of
them
were
comrades
of
the
hero
of
the
hermitage
and
received
his
commendation
for
gallantry
at
new
orleans
at
sixteen
years
of
age
i
was
given
to
the
service
of
my
country
for
twelve
years
of
my
life
i
have
borne
its
arms
and
served
it
zealously
if
not
well
as
i
feel
the
infirmities
which
suffering
more
than
age
has
brought
upon
me
it
would
be
a
bitter
reflection
indeed
if
i
was
forced
to
conclude
that
my
countrymen
would
hold
all
this
light
when
weighed
against
the
empty
panegyric
which
a
politician
can
bestow
upon
the
union
for
which
he
never
made
a
sacrifice
in
the
senate
i
announced
that
if
any
respectable
man
would
call
me
a
disunionist
i
would
answer
him
in
monosyllables
but
i
have
often
asserted
the
right
for
which
the
battles
of
the
revolution
were
fought
the
right
of
a
people
to
change
their
government
whenever
it
was
found
to
be
oppressive
and
subversive
of
the

of
my

in

and
the
like
occupations
the
time
passed
pleasantly
away
until
my
retirement
was
interrupted
by
an
invitation
to
take
a
place
in
the
cabinet
of
pierce
who
had
been
elected
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
in
november
although
warmly
attached
to
pierce
personally
and
entertaining
the
highest
estimate
of
his
character
and
political
principles
private
and
personal
reasons
led
me
to
decline
the
offer
this
was
followed
by
an
invitation
to
attend
the
ceremony
of
his
inauguration
which
took
place
on
the
of
march
while
in
washington
on
this
visit
i
was
induced
by
public
considerations
to
reconsider
my
determination
and
accept
the
office
of
secretary
of
war
the
public
records
of
that
period
will
best
show
how
the
duties
of
that
office
were
performed
while
in
the
senate
i
had
advocated
the
construction
of
a
railway
to
connect
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
with
the
pacific
coast
and
when
an
appropriation
was
made
to
determine
the
most
eligible
route
for
that
purpose
the
secretary
of
war
was
charged
with
its
application
we
had
then
but
little
of
that
minute
and
accurate
knowledge
of
the
interior
of
the
continent
which
was
requisite
for
a
determination
of
the
problem
several
different
parties
were
therefore
organized
to
examine
the
various
routes
supposed
to
be
practicable
within
the
northern
and
southern
limits
of
the
united
states
the
arguments
which
i
had
used
as
a
senator
were
the
military
necessity
for
such
means
of
transportation
and
the
need
of
safe
and
rapid
communication
with
the
pacific
slope
to
secure
its
continuance
as
a
part
of
the
union
in
the
organization
and
equipment
of
these
parties
and
in
the
selection
of
their
officers
care
was
taken
to
provide
for
securing
full
and
accurate
information
upon
every
point
involved
in
the
determination
of
the
route
the
only
discrimination
made
was
in
the
more
prompt
and
thorough
equipment
of
the
parties
for
the
extreme
northern
line
and
this
was
only
because
that
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
difficult
of
execution
of
all
the
surveys
in
like
manner
my
advocacy
while
in
the
senate
of
an
extension
of
the
capitol
by
the
construction
of
a
new
and
hall
of
representatives
may
have
caused
the
appropriation
for
that
object
to
be
put
under
my
charge
as
secretary
of
war
during
my
administration
of
the
war
department
material
changes
were
made
in
the
models
of
arms
iron
were
introduced
and
experiments
were
made
which
led
to
the
casting
of
heavy
guns
hollow
instead
of
boring
them
after
casting
inquiries
were
made
with
regard
to
gunpowder
which
subsequently
led
to
the
use
of
a
coarser
grain
for
artillery
during
the
same
period
the
army
was
increased
by
the
addition
of
two
regiments
of
infantry
and
two
of
cavalry
the
officers
of
these
regiments
were
chosen
partly
by
selection
from
those
already
in
service
in
the
regular
army
and
partly
by
appointment
from
civil
life
in
making
the
selections
from
the
army
i
was
continually
indebted
to
the
assistance
of
that
and
accurately
informed
officer
colonel
samuel
cooper
the
of
whom
it
may
be
proper
here
to
say
that
although
his
life
had
been
spent
in
the
army
and
he
of
course
had
the
likes
and
dislikes
inseparable
from
men
who
are
brought
into
close
contact
and
occasional
rivalry
i
never
found
in
his
official
recommendations
any
indication
of
partiality
or
prejudice
toward
any
one
when
the
first
list
was
made
out
to
be
submitted
to
the
president
a
difficulty
was
found
to
exist
which
had
not
occurred
either
to
colonel
cooper
or
myself
this
was
that
the
officers
selected
purely
on
their
military
record
did
not
constitute
a
roster
conforming
to
that
distribution
among
the
different
states
which
for
political
considerations
it
was
thought
desirable
to
observe
that
is
to
say
the
number
of
such
officers
of
southern
birth
was
found
to
be
disproportionately
great
under
instructions
from
the
president
the
list
was
therefore
revised
and
modified
in
accordance
with
this
new
element
of
geographical
distribution
this
as
i
am
happy
to
remember
was
the
only
occasion
in
which
the
current
of
my
official
action
while
secretary
of
war
was
disturbed
in
any
way
by
sectional
or
political
considerations
under
former
administrations
of
the
war
office
it
had
not
been
customary
to
make
removals
or
appointments
upon
political
grounds
except
in
the
case
of
clerkships
to
this
usage
i
not
only
adhered
but
extended
it
to
include
the
clerkships
also
the
chief
clerk
who
had
been
removed
by
my
predecessor
had
peculiar
qualifications
for
the
place
and
although
known
to
me
only
officially
he
was
restored
to
the
position
it
will
probably
be
conceded
by
all
who
are
well
informed
on
the
subject
that
his
restoration
was
a
benefit
to
the
public
service
the
reader
desirous
for
further
information
relative
to
the
administration
of
the
war
department
during
this
period
may
find
it
in
the
various
official
reports
and
estimates
of
works
of
defense
prosecuted
or
recommended
arsenals
of
construction
and
depots
of
arms
maintained
or
suggested
and
foundries
employed
during
the
presidency
of
pierce
having
been
again
elected
by
the
legislature
of
mississippi
as
senator
to
the
united
states
i
passed
from
the
cabinet
of
pierce
on
the
last
day
of
his
term
march
to
take
my
seat
in
the
senate
the
administration
of
franklin
pierce
presents
the
only
instance
in
our
history
of
the
continuance
of
a
cabinet
for
four
years
without
a
single
change
in
its
when
it
is
remembered
that
there
was
much
dissimilarity
if
not
incongruity
of
character
among
the
members
of
that
cabinet
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
power
over
men
possessed
and
exercised
by
pierce
chivalrous
generous
amiable
true
to
his
friends
and
to
his
faith
frank
and
bold
in
the
declaration
of
his
opinions
he
never
deceived
any
one
and
if
treachery
had
ever
come
near
him
it
would
have
stood
abashed
in
the
presence
of
his
truth
his
manliness
and
his
confiding
simplicity
footnote
soon
after
my
entrance
upon
duty
as
secretary
of
war
general
jesup
the
presented
to
me
a
list
of
names
from
which
to
make
selection
of
a
clerk
for
his
department
observing
that
he
had
attached
certain
figures
to
these
names
i
asked
whether
the
figures
were
intended
to
indicate
the
relative
qualifications
or
preference
in
his
estimation
of
the
several
applicants
and
upon
his
answer
in
the
affirmative
without
further
question
authorized
him
to
appoint
no
of
his
list
a
day
or
two
afterward
certain
democratic
members
of
congress
called
on
me
and
politely
inquired
whether
it
was
true
that
i
had
appointed
a
whig
to
a
position
in
the
war
office
certainly
not
i
answered
we
thought
you
were
not
aware
of
it
said
they
and
proceeded
to
inform
me
that
the
recent
appointee
to
the
clerkship
just
mentioned
was
a
whig
after
listening
patiently
to
this
statement
i
answered
that
it
was
they
who
were
deceived
not
i
had
appointed
a
clerk
he
had
been
appointed
neither
as
a
whig
nor
as
a
democrat
but
merely
as
the
fittest
candidate
for
the
place
in
the
estimation
of
the
chief
of
the
bureau
to
which
it
belonged
i
further
gave
them
to
understand
that
the
same
principle
of
selection
would
be
followed
in
similar
cases
so
far
as
my
authority
extended
after
some
further
discussion
of
the
question
the
visitors
withdrew
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
the
interview
the
on
hearing
of
this
conversation
hastened
to
inform
me
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
the
appointee
to
the
office
had
been
confounded
with
his
father
who
was
a
whig
but
that
he
the
son
was
a
democrat
i
assured
the
general
that
this
was
altogether
immaterial
adding
that
it
was
a
very
pretty
quarrel
as
it
stood
and
that
i
had
no
desire
to
effect
a
settlement
of
it
on
any
inferior
issue
thenceforward
however
i
was
but
little
troubled
with
any
pressure
for
political
appointments
in
the
department
chapter

at
the

of

the
protective
origin
and
progress
of
who
were
the
friends
of
the
union
an
illustration
of
political
morality
the
organization
of
the
territory
of
kansas
was
the
first
question
that
gave
rise
to
exciting
debate
after
my
return
to
the
senate
the
celebrated
bill
had
become
a
law
during
the
administration
of
pierce
as
this
occupies
a
large
space
in
the
political
history
of
the
period
it
is
proper
to
state
some
facts
connected
with
it
which
were
not
public
but
were
known
to
me
and
to
others
yet
living
the
declaration
often
repeated
in
that
climate
and
the
will
of
the
people
concerned
should
determine
their
institutions
when
they
should
form
a
constitution
and
as
a
state
be
admitted
into
the
union
and
that
no
legislation
by
congress
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
that
will
when
so
expressed
was
but
the
announcement
of
the
fact
so
firmly
established
in
the
constitution
that
sovereignty
resided
alone
in
the
states
and
that
congress
had
only
delegated
powers
it
has
been
sometimes
contended
that
because
the
congress
of
the
confederation
by
the
ordinance
of
prohibited
involuntary
servitude
in
all
the
northwestern
territory
the
framers
of
the
constitution
must
have
recognized
such
power
to
exist
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
hence
the
deduction
that
the
prohibitory
clause
of
what
is
known
as
the
missouri
compromise
was
justified
by
the
precedent
of
the
ordinance
of
to
make
the
action
of
the
congress
of
the
confederation
a
precedent
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
to
overlook
the
great
distinction
between
the
two
the
congress
of
the
confederation
represented
the
states
in
their
sovereignty
and
as
such
representatives
had
legislative
executive
and
in
some
degree
judicial
power
confided
to
it
virtually
it
was
an
assemblage
of
the
states
in
certain
cases
a
majority
of
nine
states
were
required
to
decide
a
question
but
there
is
no
express
limitation
or
restriction
such
as
is
to
be
found
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
general
government
of
the
union
is
composed
of
three
departments
of
which
the
congress
is
the
legislative
branch
and
which
is
checked
by
the
revisory
power
of
the
judiciary
and
the
veto
power
of
the
executive
and
above
all
is
expressly
limited
in
legislation
to
powers
expressly
delegated
by
the
states
if
then
it
be
admitted
which
is
certainly
questionable
that
the
congress
of
the
confederation
had
power
to
exclude
slave
property
northwest
of
the
ohio
river
that
power
must
have
been
derived
from
its
character
as
representing
the
states
in
their
sovereignty
for
no
indication
of
such
a
power
is
to
be
found
in
the
articles
of
confederation
if
it
be
assumed
that
the
absence
of
a
prohibition
was
equivalent
to
the
admission
of
the
power
in
the
congress
of
the
confederation
the
assumption
would
avail
nothing
in
the
congress
under
the
constitution
where
power
is
expressly
limited
to
what
had
been
delegated
more
briefly
it
may
be
stated
that
the
congress
of
the
confederation
could
like
the
legislature
of
a
state
do
what
had
not
been
prohibited
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
could
only
do
what
had
been
expressly
permitted
it
is
submitted
whether
this
last
position
is
not
conclusive
against
the
possession
of
power
by
the
united
states
congress
to
legislate
slavery
into
or
exclude
it
from
territories
belonging
to
the
united
states
this
subject
which
had
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
been
one
of
angry
discussion
and
sectional
strife
was
revived
and
found
occasion
for
renewed
discussion
in
the
organization
of
territorial
governments
for
kansas
and
nebraska
the
committees
on
territories
of
the
two
houses
agreed
to
report
a
bill
in
accordance
with
that
recognized
principle
provided
they
could
first
be
assured
that
it
would
receive
favorable
consideration
from
the
president
this
agreement
was
made
on
saturday
and
the
ensuing
monday
was
the
day
and
the
only
day
for
two
weeks
on
which
according
to
the
order
of
business
established
by
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
bill
could
be
introduced
by
the
committee
of
that
house
on
sunday
morning
the
of
january
gentlemen
of
each
committee
called
at
my
house
and
douglas
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
fully
explained
the
proposed
bill
and
stated
their
purpose
to
be
through
my
aid
to
obtain
an
interview
on
that
day
with
the
president
to
ascertain
whether
the
bill
would
meet
his
approbation
the
president
was
known
to
be
rigidly
opposed
to
the
reception
of
visits
on
sunday
for
the
discussion
of
any
political
subject
but
in
this
case
it
was
urged
as
necessary
in
order
to
enable
the
committee
to
make
their
report
the
next
day
i
went
with
them
to
the
executive
mansion
and
leaving
them
in
the
sought
the
president
in
his
private
apartments
and
explained
to
him
the
occasion
of
the
visit
he
thereupon
met
the
gentlemen
patiently
listened
to
the
reading
of
the
bill
and
their
explanations
of
it
decided
that
it
rested
upon
sound
constitutional
principles
and
recognized
in
it
only
a
return
to
that
rule
which
had
been
infringed
by
the
compromise
of
and
the
restoration
of
which
had
been
foreshadowed
by
the
legislation
of
this
bill
was
not
therefore
as
has
been
improperly
asserted
a
measure
inspired
by
pierce
or
any
of
his
cabinet
nor
was
it
the
first
step
taken
toward
the
repeal
of
the
conditions
or
obligations
expressed
or
implied
by
the
establishment
in
of
the
line
of
degrees
and
thirty
minutes
that
compact
had
been
virtually
abrogated
in
by
the
refusal
of
the
representatives
of
the
north
to
apply
it
to
the
territory
then
recently
acquired
from
mexico
in
may
the
bill
was
passed
its
purpose
was
declared
in
the
bill
itself
to
be
to
carry
into
practical
operation
the
propositions
and
principles
established
by
the
compromise
measures
of
the
missouri
compromise
therefore
was
not
repealed
by
that
bill
its
virtual
repeal
by
the
legislation
of
was
recognized
as
an
existing
fact
and
it
was
declared
to
be
inoperative
and
void
it
was
added
that
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
the
act
was
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
thereof
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
subject
only
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
from
the
terms
of
this
bill
as
well
as
from
the
arguments
that
were
used
in
its
behalf
it
is
evident
that
its
purpose
was
to
leave
the
territories
equally
open
to
the
people
of
all
the
states
with
every
species
of
property
recognized
by
any
of
them
to
permit
climate
and
soil
to
determine
the
current
of
immigration
and
to
secure
to
the
people
themselves
the
right
to
form
their
own
institutions
according
to
their
own
will
as
soon
as
they
should
acquire
the
right
of
that
is
to
say
as
soon
as
their
numbers
should
entitle
them
to
organize
themselves
into
a
state
prepared
to
take
its
place
as
an
equal
sovereign
member
of
the
federal
union
the
claim
afterward
advanced
by
douglas
and
others
that
this
declaration
was
intended
to
assert
the
right
of
the
first
settlers
of
a
territory
in
its
inchoate
rudimental
dependent
and
transitional
condition
to
determine
the
character
of
its
institutions
constituted
the
doctrine
popularly
known
as
squatter
sovereignty
its
assertion
led
to
the
dissensions
which
ultimately
resulted
in
a
rupture
of
the
democratic
party
sectional
rivalry
the
deadly
foe
of
the
domestic
tranquillity
and
the
general
welfare
which
the
compact
of
union
was
formed
to
insure
now
interfered
with
gigantic
efforts
to
prevent
that
free
migration
which
had
been
promised
and
to
hinder
the
decision
by
climate
and
the
interests
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
institutions
to
be
established
by
these
embryo
states
societies
were
formed
in
the
north
to
supply
money
and
send
emigrants
into
the
new
territories
and
a
famous
preacher
addressing
a
body
of
those
emigrants
charged
them
to
carry
with
them
to
kansas
the
bible
and
sharpe
rifles
the
latter
were
of
course
to
be
leveled
against
the
bosoms
of
their
southern
brethren
who
might
migrate
to
the
same
territory
but
the
use
to
be
made
of
the
bible
in
the
same
fraternal
enterprise
was
left
unexplained
by
the
reverend
gentleman
the
employed
to
train
the
northern
mind
for
the
deeds
contemplated
by
the
agitators
was
no
extension
of
slavery
was
this
sentiment
real
or
feigned
the
number
of
slaves
as
has
already
been
clearly
shown
would
not
have
been
increased
by
their
transportation
to
new
territory
it
could
not
be
augmented
by
further
importation
for
the
law
of
the
land
made
that
piracy
southern
men
were
the
leading
authors
of
that
enactment
and
the
public
opinion
of
their
descendants
stronger
than
the
law
fully
sustained
it
the
climate
of
kansas
and
nebraska
was
altogether
unsuited
to
the
negro
and
the
soil
was
not
adapted
to
those
productions
for
which
negro
labor
could
be
profitably
employed
if
then
any
negroes
held
to
service
or
labor
as
provided
in
the
compact
of
union
had
been
transported
to
those
territories
they
would
have
been
such
as
were
bound
by
personal
attachment
mutually
existing
between
master
and
servant
which
would
have
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
former
to
consider
the
latter
as
property
convertible
into
money
as
white
laborers
adapted
to
the
climate
and
its
products
flowed
into
the
country
negro
labor
would
have
inevitably
become
a
tax
to
those
who
held
it
and
their
emancipation
would
have
followed
that
condition
as
it
has
in
all
the
northern
states
old
or
new
wisconsin
furnishing
the
last
example
it
may
therefore
be
reasonably
concluded
that
the
was
employed
by
the
artful
to
inflame
the
minds
of
the
less
informed
and
less
discerning
that
it
was
adopted
in
utter
disregard
of
the
means
by
which
negro
emancipation
might
have
been
peaceably
accomplished
in
the
territories
and
with
the
sole
object
of
obtaining
sectional
control
and
personal
promotion
by
means
of
popular
agitation
the
success
attending
this
artifice
was
remarkable
to
such
an
extent
was
it
made
available
that
northern
indignation
was
aroused
on
the
absurd
accusation
that
the
south
had
destroyed
that
sacred
instrument
the
compromise
of
the
internecine
war
which
raged
in
kansas
for
several
years
was
substituted
for
the
promised
peace
under
the
operation
of
the
natural
laws
regulating
migration
to
new
countries
for
the
fratricide
which
dyed
the
virgin
soil
of
kansas
with
the
blood
of
those
who
should
have
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
subduing
the
wilderness
for
the
frauds
which
corrupted
the
and
made
the
name
of
election
a
misnomer
let
the
authors
of
squatter
sovereignty
and
the
fomenters
of
sectional
hatred
answer
to
the
posterity
for
whose
peace
and
happiness
the
fathers
formed
the
federal
compact
in
these
scenes
of
strife
were
trained
the
incendiaries
who
afterward
invaded
virginia
under
the
leadership
of
john
brown
and
at
this
time
germinated
the
sentiments
which
led
men
of
high
position
to
sustain
with
their
influence
and
their
money
this
murderous
incursion
into
the
south
now
was
seen
the
lightning
of
that
storm
the
distant
muttering
of
which
had
been
heard
so
long
and
against
which
the
wise
and
the
patriotic
had
given
solemn
warning
regarding
it
as
the
sign
which
portended
a
dissolution
of
the
union
diversity
of
interests
and
of
opinions
among
the
states
of
the
confederation
had
in
the
beginning
presented
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
formation
of
a
more
perfect
union
the
compact
was
the
result
of
compromise
between
the
states
at
that
time
generally
distinguished
as
navigating
and
agricultural
afterward
as
northern
and
southern
when
the
first
census
was
taken
in
there
was
but
little
numerical
difference
in
the
population
of
these
two
sections
and
including
states
about
to
be
admitted
there
was
also
an
exact
equality
in
the
number
of
states
each
section
had
therefore
the
power
of
and
might
feel
secure
against
any
danger
of
federal
aggression
if
the
disturbance
of
that
equilibrium
had
been
the
consequence
of
natural
causes
and
the
government
of
the
whole
had
continued
to
be
administered
strictly
for
the
general
welfare
there
would
have
been
no
ground
for
complaint
of
the
result
under
the
old
confederation
the
southern
states
had
a
large
excess
of
territory
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
of
florida
and
of
texas
afterward
greatly
increased
this
excess
the
generosity
and
patriotism
of
virginia
led
her
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
to
cede
the
northwest
territory
to
the
united
states
the
missouri
compromise
surrendered
to
the
north
all
the
newly
acquired
region
not
included
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
north
of
the
parallel
of
degrees
and
a
half
the
northern
part
of
texas
was
in
like
manner
given
up
by
the
compromise
of
and
the
north
having
obtained
by
those
successive
cessions
a
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
took
to
itself
all
the
territory
acquired
from
mexico
thus
by
the
action
of
the
general
government
the
means
were
provided
permanently
to
destroy
the
original
equilibrium
between
the
sections
nor
was
this
the
only
injury
to
which
the
south
was
subjected
under
the
power
of
congress
to
levy
duties
on
imports
tariff
laws
were
enacted
not
merely
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
as
authorized
by
the
constitution
but
positively
and
primarily
for
the
protection
against
foreign
competition
of
domestic
manufactures
the
effect
of
this
was
to
impose
the
main
burden
of
taxation
upon
the
southern
people
who
were
consumers
and
not
manufacturers
not
only
by
the
enhanced
price
of
imports
but
indirectly
by
the
consequent
depreciation
in
the
value
of
exports
which
were
chiefly
the
products
of
southern
states
the
imposition
of
this
grievance
was
unaccompanied
by
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
tax
thus
borne
was
to
be
paid
into
the
public
treasury
for
the
increase
of
price
accrued
mainly
to
the
benefit
of
the
manufacturer
nor
was
this
all
a
reference
to
the
annual
appropriations
will
show
that
the
disbursements
made
were
as
unequal
as
the
burdens
borne
the
inequality
in
both
operating
in
the
same
direction
these
causes
all
combined
to
direct
immigration
to
the
northern
section
and
with
the
increase
of
its
preponderance
appeared
more
and
more
distinctly
a
tendency
in
the
federal
government
to
pervert
functions
delegated
to
it
and
to
use
them
with
sectional
discrimination
against
the
minority
the
resistance
to
the
admission
of
missouri
as
a
state
in
was
evidently
not
owing
to
any
moral
or
constitutional
considerations
but
merely
to
political
motives
and
the
compensation
exacted
for
granting
what
was
simply
a
right
was
the
exclusion
of
the
south
from
equality
in
the
enjoyment
of
territory
which
justly
belonged
equally
to
both
and
which
was
what
the
enemies
of
the
south
stigmatized
as
slave
territory
when
acquired
the
sectional
policy
then
indicated
brought
to
its
support
the
passions
that
spring
from
man
higher
nature
but
which
like
all
passions
if
misdirected
and
perverted
become
hurtful
and
it
may
be
destructive
the
year
was
marked
by
the
public
agitation
for
the
abolition
of
that
african
servitude
which
existed
in
the
south
which
antedated
the
union
and
had
existed
in
every
one
of
the
states
that
formed
the
confederation
by
a
great
misconception
of
the
powers
belonging
to
the
general
government
and
the
responsibilities
of
citizens
of
the
northern
states
many
of
those
citizens
were
little
by
little
brought
to
the
conclusion
that
slavery
was
a
sin
for
which
were
answerable
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
federal
government
to
abate
it
though
at
the
date
above
referred
to
numerically
so
weak
when
compared
with
either
of
the
political
parties
at
the
north
as
to
excite
no
apprehension
of
their
power
for
evil
the
public
demonstrations
of
the
abolitionists
were
violently
rebuked
generally
at
the
north
the
party
was
contemned
on
account
of
the
character
of
its
leaders
and
the
more
odious
because
chief
among
them
was
an
englishman
one
thompson
who
was
supposed
to
be
an
emissary
whose
mission
was
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
dissolution
of
the
union
let
us
hope
that
it
was
reverence
for
the
obligations
of
the
constitution
as
the
soul
of
the
union
that
suggested
lurking
danger
and
rendered
the
supposed
emissary
for
its
destruction
so
odious
that
he
was
driven
from
a
massachusetts
hall
where
he
attempted
to
lecture
but
bodies
in
motion
will
overcome
bodies
at
rest
and
the
unreflecting
too
often
are
led
by
captivating
names
far
from
the
principles
they
revere
thus
by
the
activity
of
the
propagandists
of
abolitionism
and
the
misuse
of
the
sacred
word
liberty
they
recruited
from
the
ardent
worshipers
of
that
goddess
such
numbers
as
gave
them
in
many
northern
states
the
balance
of
power
between
the
two
great
political
forces
that
stood
arrayed
against
each
other
then
and
there
they
came
to
be
courted
by
both
of
the
great
parties
especially
by
the
whigs
who
had
become
the
weaker
party
of
the
two
fanaticism
to
which
is
usually
accorded
sincerity
as
an
extenuation
of
its
mischievous
tenets
affords
the
best
excuse
to
be
offered
for
the
original
abolitionists
but
that
can
not
be
conceded
to
the
political
associates
who
joined
them
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
power
with
them
it
was
but
hypocritical
cant
intended
to
deceive
hence
arose
the
declaration
of
the
existence
of
an
irrepressible
conflict
because
of
the
domestic
institutions
of
sovereign
states
institutions
over
which
neither
the
federal
government
nor
the
people
outside
of
the
limits
of
such
states
had
any
control
and
for
which
they
could
have
no
moral
or
legal
responsibility
those
who
are
to
come
after
us
and
who
will
look
without
prejudice
or
excitement
at
the
record
of
events
which
have
occurred
in
our
day
will
not
fail
to
wonder
how
men
professing
and
proclaiming
such
a
belief
should
have
so
far
imposed
upon
the
credulity
of
the
world
as
to
be
able
to
arrogate
to
themselves
the
claim
of
being
the
special
friends
of
a
union
contracted
in
order
to
insure
domestic
tranquillity
among
the
people
of
the

that
were
the
advocates
of
peace
of
law
and
of
order
who
when
taking
an
oath
to
support
and
maintain
the
constitution
did
so
with
a
mental
reservation
to
violate
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
constitution
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
compact
without
which
the
union
could
never
have
been
formed
the
tone
of
political
morality
which
could
make
this
possible
was
well
indicated
by
the
toleration
accorded
in
the
senate
to
the
flippant
inconsequential
excuse
for
it
given
by
one
of
its
most
eminent
exemplars
is
thy

that
he
should
do
this
thing

not
that

explanation
to
the

not

with
their
history
the
adopted
by
political
parties
in
the
united

have
not
always
been
strictly
significant
of
their
principles
the
old
federal
party
inclined
to
nationalism
or
consolidation
rather
than
federalization
of
the
states
on
the
other
hand
the
party
originally
known
as
republican
and
afterward
as
democratic
can
scarcely
claim
to
have
been
distinctively
or
exclusively
such
in
the
primary
sense
of
these
terms
inasmuch
as
no
party
has
ever
avowed
opposition
to
the
general
principles
of
government
by
the
people
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
democratic
party
was
that
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
the
federal
or
confederate
character
of
the
union
other
elements
have
entered
into

this
has

and

on
which
its

the

succeeded

old

by

of

roman
catholic
church

but
a
brief
duration
and
after

of
declined
as
rapidly
as
it
had
arisen
at
the
period
to
which
this
narrative
has
advanced
the
which
had
now
assumed
the
title
of
republican
party
had
grown
to
a
magnitude
which
threatened
speedily
to
obtain
entire
control
of
the
government

as
has
been
shown
upon
sectional
rivalry
and
opposition
to
the
growth
of
the
southern
equally
with
the
northern
states
of
the

it
had
absorbed
within
itself
not
only
the
abolitionists
who
were
avowedly
agitating
for
the
destruction
of
the
system
of
negro
servitude
but
other
diverse
and
heterogeneous
elements

candidates

a
diminution
of
the

the
congress
which
convened
in

of
that
year
was
decidedly
democratic
in
both
branches
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
years
however
the
kansas
agitation
and
another
cause
to
be
presently
noticed
had
so
swollen
the
ranks
of
the
republicans
that
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
congress
which
met
in
december
neither
party
had
a
decided
majority
the
balance
of
power
being
held
by
a
few
members
still
adhering
to
the
virtually
extinct
whig
and
american
or
organizations
and
a
still
smaller
number
whose
position
was
doubtful
or
irregular
more
than
eight
weeks
were
spent
in

election
of
a
speaker
and
a
republican

of
new
jersey
was
finally
elected
by
a
majority
of

vote

senate
continued
to
be
decidedly
democratic
though
with
an
increase
of
the
republican
minority
the
cause
above
alluded
to
as
contributing
to
the
rapid
growth
of
the
republican
party
after
the
elections
of
the
year
was
the
dissension
among
the
democrats
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
the
doctrine
called
by
its
inventors
and
advocates
popular
sovereignty
or
but
more
generally
and
more
accurately
known
as
squatter
sovereignty
its
character
has
already
been
concisely
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
its
origin
is
generally
attributed
to
general
cass
who
is
supposed
to
have
suggested
it
in
some
general
expressions
of
his
celebrated
nicholson
letter
written
in
december
on
the
and
of
may
it
became
necessary
for
me
in
a
debate
in
the
senate
to
review
that
letter
of
cass
from
my
remarks
then
made
the
following
extract
is
taken
the
senator
douglas
might
have
remembered
if
he
had
chosen
to
recollect
so
unimportant
a
thing
that
i
once
had
to
explain
to
him
ten
years
ago
the
fact
that
i
repudiated
the
doctrine
of
that
letter
at
the
time
it
was
published
and
that
the
democracy
of
mississippi
had
crucified
me
for
the
construction
which
i
placed
upon
it
there
were
men
mean
enough
to
suspect
that
the
construction
i
gave
to
the
nicholson
letter
was
prompted
by
the
confidence
and
affection
i
felt
for
general
taylor
at
a
subsequent
period
however
cass
thoroughly
reviewed
it
he
uttered
for
him
very
harsh
language
against
all
who
had
doubted
the
true
construction
of
his
letter
and
he
construed
it
just
as
i
had
done
during
the
canvass
of
it
remains
only
to
add
that
i
supported
cass
not
because
of
the
doctrine
of
the
nicholson
letter
but
in
despite
of
it
because
i
believed
a
democratic
president
with
a
democratic
cabinet
and
democratic
counselors
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
and
he
as
honest
a
man
as
i
believed
cass
to
be
would
be
a
safer
reliance
than
his
opponent
who
personally
possessed
my
confidence
as
much
as
any
man
living
but
who
was
of
and
must
draw
his
advisers
from
a
party
the
tenets
of
which
i
believed
to
be
opposed
to
the
interests
of
the
country
as
they
were
to
all
my
political
convictions
i
little
thought
at
that
time
that
my
advocacy
of
cass
upon
such
grounds
as
these
or
his
support
by
the
state
of
which
i
am
a
citizen
would
at
any
future
day
be
quoted
as
an
endorsement
of
the
opinions
contained
in
the
nicholson
letter
as
those
opinions
were
afterward
defined
but
it
is
not
only
upon
this
letter
but
equally
upon
the
resolutions
of
the
convention
as
constructive
of
that
letter
that
the
senator
rested
his
argument
i
will
here
say
to
the
senator
that
if
at
any
time
i
do
him
the
least
injustice
speaking
as
i
do
from
such
notes
as
i
could
take
while
he
progressed
i
will
thank
him
to
correct
me
but
this
letter
entered
into
the
canvass
there
was
a
doubt
about
its
construction
there
were
men
who
asserted
that
they
had
positive
authority
for
saying
that
it
meant
that
the
people
of
a
territory
could
only
exclude
slavery
when
the
territory
should
form
a
constitution
and
be
admitted
as
a
state
this
doubt
continued
to
hang
over
the
construction
and
it
was
that
doubt
alone
which
secured
cass
the
vote
of
mississippi
if
the
true
construction
had
been
certainly
known
he
would
have
had
no
chance
to
get
it
whatever
meaning
the
generally
discreet
and
conservative
statesman
cass
may
have
intended
to
convey
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
he
foresaw
the
extent
to
which
the
suggestions
would
be
carried
and
the
consequences
that
would
result
from
it
in
the
organization
of
a
government
for
california
in
the
theory
was
more
distinctly
advanced
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
passage
of
the
bill
in
that
it
was
fully
developed
under
the
plastic
and
constructive
genius
of
the
hon
stephen
douglas
of
illinois
the
leading
part
which
that
distinguished
senator
had
borne
in
the
authorship
and
advocacy
of
the
bill
which
affirmed
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
territories
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
subject
only
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
had
aroused
against
him
a
violent
storm
of
denunciation
in
the
state
which
he
represented
and
other
northern
states
he
met
it
very
manfully
in
some
respects
defended
his
action
resolutely
but
in
so
doing
was
led
to
make
such
concessions
of
principle
and
to
attach
such
an
interpretation
to
the
bill
as
would
have
rendered
it
practically
nugatory
a
thing
to
keep
the
promise
of
peace
to
the
ear
and
break
it
to
the
hope
the
constitution
expressly
confers
upon
congress
the
power
to
admit
new
states
into
the
union
and
also
to
dispose
of
and
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
or
other
property
belonging
to
the
united
states
under
these
grants
of
power
the
uniform
practice
of
the
government
had
been
for
congress
to
lay
off
and
divide
the
common
territory
by
convenient
boundaries
for
the
formation
of
future
states
to
provide
executive
legislative
and
judicial
departments
of
government
for
such
territories
during
their
temporary
and
provisional
period
of
pupilage
to
delegate
to
these
governments
such
authority
as
might
be
expedient
subject
always
to
the
supervision
and
controlling
government
of
the
congress
finally
at
the
proper
time
and
on
the
attainment
by
the
territory
of
sufficient
strength
and
population
for
to
receive
it
into
the
union
on
a
footing
of
entire
equality
with
the
original
states
sovereign
and
all
this
is
no
more
inconsistent
with
the
true
principles
of
popular
sovereignty
properly
understood
than
the
temporary
subjection
of
a
minor
to
parental
control
is
inconsistent
with
the
doctrines
of
the
declaration
of
independence
or
the
exceptional
discipline
of
a
or
a
military
post
with
the
principles
of
republican
freedom
the
usual
process
of
transition
from
a
territorial
condition
to
that
of
a
state
was
in
the
first
place
by
an
act
of
congress
authorizing
the
inhabitants
to
elect
representatives
for
a
convention
to
form
a
state
constitution
which
was
then
submitted
to
congress
for
approval
and
ratification
on
such
ratification
the
supervisory
control
of
congress
was
withdrawn
and
the
new
state
authorized
to
assume
its
sovereignty
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
became
citizens
of
a
state
in
the
cases
of
tennessee
in
and
arkansas
and
michigan
in
the
failure
of
the
inhabitants
to
obtain
an
enabling
act
of
congress
before
organizing
themselves
very
nearly
caused
the
rejection
of
their
applications
for
admission
as
states
though
they
were
eventually
granted
on
the
ground
that
the
subsequent
approval
and
consent
of
congress
could
heal
the
prior
irregularity
the
entire
control
of
congress
over
the
whole
subject
of
territorial
government
had
never
been
questioned
in
earlier
times
necessarily
conjoined
with
the
of
this
protectorate
was
of
course
the
of
exercising
it
for
the
safety
of
the
persons
and
property
of
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
permanently
or
temporarily
resident
in
any
part
of
the
domain
belonging
to
the
states
in
common
logically
carried
out
the
new
theory
of
popular
sovereignty

apply
to
the
first
adventurous
pioneers
settling
in
the
wilderness
before
the
organization
of
any
territorial
government
by
congress
as
well
as
afterward
if
sovereignty
is
inherent
in
a
thousand
or
five
thousand
persons
there
can
be
no
valid
ground
for
denying
its
existence
in
a
dozen
as
soon
as
they
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
governments
the
advocates
of
this
novel
doctrine
however
if
rightly
understood
generally
disavowed
any
claim
to
its
application
prior
to
the
organization
of
a
territorial
government
the
territorial
legislatures
to
which
congress
delegated
a
portion
of
its
power
and
duty
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
were
the
mere
agents
of
congress
exercising
an
authority
subject
to
congressional
supervision
and
control
an
authority
conferred
only
for
the
sake
of
convenience
and
liable
at
any
time
to
be
revoked
and
annulled
yet
it
is
proposed
to
recognize
in
these
provisional
subordinate
and
temporary
legislative
bodies
a
power
not
possessed
by
congress
itself
this
is
to
claim
that
the
creature
is
endowed
with
an
authority
not
possessed
by
the
creator
or
that
the
stream
has
risen
to
an
elevation
above
that
of
its
source
furthermore
in
contending
for
a
power
in
the
territorial
legislatures
permanently
to
determine
the
fundamental
social
and
political
institutions
of
the
territory
and
thereby
virtually
to
prescribe
those
of
the
future
state
the
advocates
of
popular
sovereignty
were
investing
those
dependent
and
subsidiary
bodies
with
powers
far
above
any
exercised
by
the
legislatures
of
the
fully
organized
and
sovereign
states
the
authority
of
the
state
legislatures
is
limited
both
by
the
federal
constitution
and
by
the
respective
state
constitutions
from
which
it
is
derived
this
latter
limitation
did
not
and
could
not
exist
in
the
territories
strange
as
it
may
seem
a
theory
founded
on
fallacies
so
flimsy
and
leading
to
conclusions
so
paradoxical
was
advanced
by
eminent
and
experienced
politicians
and
accepted
by
many
persons
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
not
so
much
perhaps
from
intelligent
conviction
as
under
the
delusive
hope
that
it
would
afford
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
irrepressible
conflict
which
had
been
declared
the
terms
popular
sovereignty
and
were
plausible
specious
and
captivating
to
the
public
ear
too
many
lost
sight
of
the
elementary
truth
that
political
sovereignty
does
not
reside
in
unorganized
or
partially
organized
masses
of
individuals
but
in
the
people
of
regularly
and
permanently
constituted
states
as
to
the
proposed
it
meant
merely
the
abnegation
by
congress
of
its
duty
to
protect
the
inhabitants
of
the
territories
subject
to
its
control
the
raid
into
virginia
under
john
brown
already
notorious
as
a
fanatical
partisan
leader
in
the
kansas
troubles
occurred
in
october
a
few
weeks
before
the
meeting
of
the
congress
insignificant
in
itself
and
in
its
immediate
results
it
afforded
a
startling
revelation
of
the
extent
to
which
sectional
hatred
and
political
fanaticism
had
blinded
the
conscience
of
a
class
of
persons
in
certain
states
of
the
union
forming
a
party
steadily
growing
stronger
in
numbers
as
well
as
in
activity
sympathy
with
its
purposes
or
methods
was
earnestly
disclaimed
by
the
representatives
of
all
parties
in
congress
but
it
was
charged
on
the
other
hand
that
it
was
only
the
natural
outgrowth
of
doctrines
and
sentiments
which
for
some
years
had
been
freely
avowed
on
the
floors
of
both
houses
a
committee
of
the
senate
made
a
long
and
laborious
investigation
of
the
facts
with
no
very
important
or
satisfactory
results
in
their
final
report
june
accompanying
the
evidence
obtained
and
submitted
this
committee
said
it
the
incursion
was
simply
the
act
of
lawless
ruffians
under
the
sanction
of
no
public
or
political
authority
distinguishable
only
from
ordinary
felonies
by
the
ulterior
ends
in
contemplation
by
them
and
by
the
fact
that
the
money
to
maintain
the
expedition
and
the
large
armament
they
brought
with
them
had
been
contributed
and
furnished
by
the
citizens
of
other
states
of
the
union
under
circumstances
that
must
continue
to
jeopard
the
safety
and
peace
of
the
southern
states
and
against
which
congress
has
no
power
to
legislate
if
the
several
states
adds
the
committee
whether
from
motives
of
policy
or
a
desire
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
union
if
not
from
fraternal
feeling
do
not
hold
it
incumbent
on
them
after
the
experience
of
the
country
to
guard
in
future
by
appropriate
legislation
against
occurrences
similar
to
the
one
here
inquired
into
the
committee
can
find
no
guarantee
elsewhere
for
the
security
of
peace
between
the
states
of
the
union
on
february
the
author
submitted
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
series
of
resolutions
afterward
slightly
modified
to
read
as
follows
that
in
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
the
states
adopting
the
same
acted
severally
as
free
and
independent
sovereignties
delegating
a
portion
of
their
powers
to
be
exercised
by
the
federal
government
for
the
increased
security
of
each
against
dangers
as
well
as
foreign
and
that
any
intermeddling
by
any
one
or
more
states
or
by
a
combination
of
their
citizens
with
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
others
on
any
pretext
whatever
political
moral
or
religious
with
the
view
to
their
disturbance
or
subversion
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
insulting
to
the
states
so
interfered
with
endangers
their
domestic
peace
and
tranquillity
objects
for
which
the
constitution
was
formed
and
by
necessary
consequence
tends
to
weaken
and
destroy
the
union
itself
that
negro
slavery
as
it
exists
in
fifteen
states
of
this
union
composes
an
important
portion
of
their
domestic
institutions
inherited
from
our
ancestors
and
existing
at
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
by
which
it
is
recognized
as
constituting
an
important
element
in
the
apportionment
of
powers
among
the
states
and
that
no
change
of
opinion
or
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
states
of
the
union
in
relation
to
this
institution
can
justify
them
or
their
citizens
in
open
or
covert
attacks
thereon
with
a
view
to
its
overthrow
and
that
all
such
attacks
are
in
manifest
violation
of
the
mutual
and
solemn
pledge
to
protect
and
defend
each
other
given
by
the
states
respectively
on
entering
into
the
constitutional
compact
which
formed
the
union
and
are
a
manifest
breach
of
faith
and
a
violation
of
the
most
solemn
obligations
that
the
union
of
these
states
rests
on
the
equality
of
rights
and
privileges
among
its
members
and
that
it
is
especially
the
duty
of
the
senate
which
represents
the
states
in
their
sovereign
capacity
to
resist
all
attempts
to
discriminate
either
in
relation
to
persons
or
property
in
the
territories
which
are
the
common
possessions
of
the
united
states
so
as
to
give
advantages
to
the
citizens
of
one
state
which
are
not
equally
assured
to
those
of
every
other
state
that
neither
congress
nor
a
territorial
legislature
whether
by
direct
legislation
or
legislation
of
an
indirect
and
unfriendly
character
possesses
power
to
annul
or
impair
the
constitutional
right
of
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
take
his
slave
property
into
the
common
territories
and
there
hold
and
enjoy
the
same
while
the
territorial
condition
remains
that
if
experience
should
at
any
time
prove
that
the
judiciary
and
executive
authority
do
not
possess
means
to
insure
adequate
protection
to
constitutional
rights
in
a
territory
and
if
the
territorial
government
shall
fail
or
refuse
to
provide
the
necessary
remedies
for
that
purpose
it
will
be
the
duty
of
congress
to
supply
such
deficiency
that
the
inhabitants
of
a
territory
of
the
united
states
when
they
rightfully
form
a
constitution
to
be
admitted
as
a
state
into
the
union
may
then
for
the
first
time
like
the
people
of
a
state
when
forming
a
new
constitution
decide
for
themselves
whether
slavery
as
a
domestic
institution
shall
be
maintained
or
prohibited
within
their
jurisdiction
and
they
shall
be
received
into
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitution
may
prescribe
at
the
time
of
their
admission
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
for
the
rendition
of
fugitives
from
service
or
labor
the
adoption
of
which
the
union
could
not
have
been
formed
and
that
the
laws
of
and
which
were
enacted
to
secure
its
execution
and
the
main
features
of
which
being
similar
bear
the
impress
of
nearly
seventy
years
of
sanction
by
the
highest
judicial
authority
should
be
honestly
and
faithfully
observed
and
maintained
by
all
who
enjoy
the
benefits
of
our
compact
of
union
and
that
all
acts
of
individuals
or
of
state
legislatures
to
defeat
the
purpose
or
nullify
the
requirements
of
that
provision
and
the
laws
made
in
pursuance
of
it
are
hostile
in
character
subversive
of
the
constitution
and
revolutionary
in
their
effect
after
a
protracted
and
earnest
debate
these
resolutions
were
adopted
on
the
and
of
may
by
a
decided
majority
of
the
senate
varying
from
to
yeas
against
from
two
to
nays
the
democrats
both
northern
and
southern
sustaining
them
unitedly
with
the
exception
of
one
adverse
vote
that
of
pugh
of
ohio
on
the
fourth
and
sixth
resolutions
the
republicans
all
voted
against
them
or
refrained
from
voting
at
all
except
that
teneyck
of
new
jersey
voted
for
the
fifth
and
seventh
of
the
series
douglas
the
leader
if
not
the
author
of
popular
sovereignty
was
absent
on
account
of
illness
and
there
were
a
few
other
absentees
the
conclusion
of
a
speech
in
reply
to
douglas
a
few
days
before
the
vote
was
taken
on
these
resolutions
is
introduced
here
as
the
best
evidence
of
the
position
of
the
author
at
that
period
of
excitement
and
agitation
conclusion
of
reply
to
douglas
president
i
briefly
and
reluctantly
referred
because
the
subject
had
been
introduced
to
the
attitude
of
mississippi
on
a
former
occasion
i
will
now
as
briefly
say
that
in
and
in
mississippi
was
and
is
ready
to
make
every
concession
which
it
becomes
her
to
make
to
the
welfare
and
the
safety
of
the
union
if
on
a
former
occasion
she
hoped
too
much
from
fraternity
the
responsibility
for
her
disappointment
rests
upon
those
who
failed
to
fulfill
her
expectations
she
still
clings
to
the
government
as
our
fathers
formed
it
she
is
ready
and
as
in
her
past
and
though
brief
yet
brilliant
history
to
maintain
that
government
in
all
its
power
and
to
vindicate
its
honor
with
all
the
means
she
possesses
i
say
brilliant
history
for
it
was
in
the
very
morning
of
her
existence
that
her
sons
on
the
plains
of
new
orleans
were
announced
in
general
orders
to
have
been
the
admiration
of
one
army
and
the
wonder
of
the
other
that
we
had
a
division
in
relation
to
the
measures
enacted
in
is
true
that
the
southern
rights
men
became
the
minority
in
the
election
which
resulted
is
true
but
no
figure
of
speech
could
warrant
the
senator
in
speaking
of
them
as
subdued
as
coming
to
him
or
anybody
else
for
quarter
i
deemed
it
offensive
when
it
was
uttered
and
the
scorn
with
which
i
repelled
it
at
the
instant
time
has
only
softened
to
contempt
our
flag
was
never
borne
from
the
field
we
had
carried
it
in
the
face
of
defeat
with
a
knowledge
that
defeat
awaited
it
but
scarcely
had
the
smoke
of
the
battle
passed
away
which
proclaimed
another
victor
before
the
general
voice
admitted
that
the
field
again
was
ours
i
have
not
seen
a
sagacious
reflecting
man
who
was
cognizant
of
the
events
as
they
transpired
at
the
time
who
does
not
say
that
within
two
weeks
after
the
election
our
party
was
in
a
majority
and
the
next
election
which
occurred
showed
that
we
possessed
the
state
beyond
controversy
how
we
have
wielded
that
power
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
i
trust
others
may
see
forbearance
in
our
conduct
that
with
a
determination
to
insist
upon
our
constitutional
rights
then
and
now
there
is
an
unwavering
desire
to
maintain
the
government
and
to
uphold
the
democratic
party
we
believe
now
as
we
have
asserted
on
former
occasions
that
the
best
hope
for
the
perpetuity
of
our
institutions
depends
upon
the
coöperation
the
harmony
the
zealous
action
of
the
democratic
party
we
cling
to
that
party
from
conviction
that
its
principles
and
its
aims
are
those
of
truth
and
the
country
as
we
cling
to
the
union
for
the
fulfillment
of
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
formed
whenever
we
shall
be
taught
that
the
democratic
party
is
recreant
to
its
principles
whenever
we
shall
learn
that
it
can
not
be
relied
upon
to
maintain
the
great
measures
which
constitute
its
vitality
i
for
one
shall
be
ready
to
leave
it
and
so
when
we
declare
our
tenacious
adherence
to
the
union
it
is
the
union
of
the
constitution
if
the
compact
between
the
states
is
to
be
trampled
into
the
dust
if
anarchy
is
to
be
substituted
for
the
usurpation
and
consolidation
which
threatened
the
government
at
an
earlier
period
if
the
union
is
to
become
powerless
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
established
and
we
are
vainly
to
appeal
to
it
for
protection
then
sir
conscious
of
the
rectitude
of
our
course
the
justice
of
our
cause
yet
humbly
confidingly
trusting
in
the
arm
that
guided
and
protected
our
fathers
we
look
beyond
the
confines
of
the
union
for
the
maintenance
of
our
rights
an
habitual
reverence
and
cherished
affection
for
the
government
will
bind
us
to
it
longer
than
our
interests
would
suggest
or
require
but
he
is
a
poor
student
of
the
history
who
does
not
understand
that
communities
at
last
must
yield
to
the
dictates
of
their
interests
that
the
affection
the
mutual
desire
for
the
mutual
good
which
existed
among
our
fathers
may
be
weakened
in
succeeding
generations
by
the
denial
of
right
and
hostile
demonstration
until
the
equality
guaranteed
but
not
secured
within
the
union
may
be
sought
for
without
it
must
be
evident
to
even
a
careless
observer
of
our
race
it
is
time
to
be
up
and
doing
there
is
yet
time
to
remove
the
causes
of
dissension
and
alienation
which
are
now
distracting
and
have
for
years
past
divided
the
country
if
the
senator
correctly
described
me
as
having
at
a
former
period
against
my
own
preferences
and
opinions
acquiesced
in
the
decision
of
my
party
if
when
i
had
youth
when
physical
vigor
gave
promise
of
many
days
and
the
future
was
painted
in
the
colors
of
hope
i
could
thus
surrender
my
own
convictions
my
own
prejudices
and
coöperate
with
my
political
friends
according
to
their
views
of
the
best
method
of
promoting
the
public
good
now
when
the
years
of
my
future
can
not
be
many
and
experience
has
sobered
the
hopeful
tints
of
youth
gilding
when
approaching
the
evening
of
life
the
shadows
are
reversed
and
the
mind
turns
retrospectively
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
i
would
abandon
lightly
or
idly
put
on
trial
the
party
to
which
i
have
steadily
adhered
it
is
rather
to
be
assumed
that
conservatism
which
belongs
to
the
timidity
or
caution
of
increasing
years
would
lead
me
to
cling
to
to
be
supported
by
rather
than
to
cast
off
the
organization
with
which
i
have
been
so
long
connected
if
i
am
driven
to
consider
the
necessity
of
separating
myself
from
those
old
and
dear
relations
of
discarding
the
accustomed
support
under
circumstances
such
as
i
have
described
might
not
my
friends
who
differ
from
me
pause
and
inquire
whether
there
is
not
something
involved
in
it
which
calls
for
their
careful
revision
i
desire
no
divided
flag
for
the
democratic
party
our
principles
are
national
they
belong
to
every
state
of
the
union
and
though
elections
may
be
lost
by
their
assertion
they
constitute
the
only
foundation
on
which
we
can
maintain
power
on
which
we
can
again
rise
to
the
dignity
the
democracy
once
possessed
does
not
the
senator
from
illinois
see
in
the
sectional
character
of
the
vote
be
received
that
his
opinions
are
not
acceptable
to
every
portion
of
the
country
is
not
the
fact
that
the
resolutions
adopted
by
seventeen
states
on
which
the
greatest
reliance
must
be
placed
for
democratic
support
are
in
opposition
to
the
dogma
to
which
he
still
clings
a
warning
that
if
he
persists
and
succeeds
in
forcing
his
theory
upon
the
democratic
party
its
days
are
numbered
we
ask
only
for

at

war
of

each
of
the
thirteen
colonies
that
had
been
engaged
in
that
contest
was
severally
acknowledged
by
the
great
britain
to
be
a
free
and
independent
state
the
confederation
of
those
states
embraced
an
area
so
extensive
with
climate
and
products
so
various
that
rivalries
and
conflicts
of
interest
soon
began
to
be
manifested
it
required
all
the
power
of
wisdom
and
patriotism
animated
by
the
affection
engendered
by
common
sufferings
and
dangers
to
keep
these
rivalries
under
restraint
and
to
effect
those
compromises
which
it
was
fondly
hoped
would
insure
the
harmony
and
mutual
good
offices
of
each
for
the
benefit
of
all
it
was
in
this
spirit
of
patriotism
and
confidence
in
the
continuance
of
such
abiding
good
will
as
would
for
all
time
preclude
hostile
aggression
that
virginia
ceded
for
the
use
of
the
confederated
states
all
that
vast
extent
of
territory
lying
north
of
the
ohio
river
out
of
which
have
since
been
formed
five
states
and
part
of
a
sixth
the
addition
of
these
states
has
accrued
entirely
to
the
preponderance
of
the
northern
section
over
that
from
which
the
donation
proceeded
and
to
the
disturbance
of
that
equilibrium
which
existed
at
the
close
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
grievances
which
led
to
that
war
were
directly
inflicted
upon
the
northern
colonies
those
of
the
south
had
no
material
cause
of
complaint
but
actuated
by
sympathy
for
their
northern
brethren
and
a
devotion
to
the
principles
of
civil
liberty
and
community
independence
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
ancestry
and
which
were
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
they
made
common
cause
with
their
neighbors
and
may
at
least
claim
to
have
done
their
full
share
in
the
war
that
ensued
by
the
exclusion
of
the
south
in
from
all
that
part
of
the
louisiana
purchase
lying
north
of
the
parallel
of
degrees
thirty
minutes
and
not
included
in
the
state
of
missouri
by
the
extension
of
that
line
of
exclusion
to
embrace
the
territory
acquired
from
texas
and
by
the
appropriation
of
the
territory
obtained
from
mexico
under
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
both
north
and
south
of
that
line
it
may
be
stated
with
approximate
accuracy
that
the
north
had
monopolized
to
herself
more
than
three
fourths
of
all
that
had
been
added
to
the
domain
of
the
united
states
since
the
declaration
of
independence
this
inequality
which
began
as
has
been
shown
in
the
more
generous
than
wise
confidence
of
the
south
was
employed
to
obtain
for
the
north
the
lion
share
of
what
was
afterward
added
at
the
cost
of
the
public
treasure
and
the
blood
of
patriots
i
do
not
care
to
estimate
the
relative
proportion
contributed
by
each
of
the
two
sections
nor
was
this
the
only
cause
that
operated
to
disappoint
the
reasonable
hopes
and
to
blight
the
fair
prospects
under
which
the
original
compact
was
formed
the
effects
of
discriminating
duties
upon
imports
have
been
referred
to
in
a
former
chapter
favoring
the
manufacturing
region
which
was
the
north
burdening
the
exporting
region
which
was
the
south
and
so
imposing
upon
the
latter
a
double
tax
one
by
the
increased
price
of
articles
of
consumption
which
so
far
as
they
were
of
home
production
went
into
the
pockets
of
the
manufacturer
the
other
by
the
diminished
value
of
articles
of
export
which
was
so
much
withheld
from
the
pockets
of
the
agriculturist
in
like
manner
the
power
of
the
majority
section
was
employed
to
appropriate
to
itself
an
unequal
share
of
the
public
disbursements
these
combined
causes
the
possession
of
more
territory
more
money
and
a
wider
field
for
the
employment
of
special
labor
all
served
to
attract
immigration
and
with
increasing
population
the
greed
grew
by
what
it
fed
on
this
became
distinctly
manifest
when
the
republican
convention
assembled
in
chicago
on
may
to
nominate
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
it
was
a
purely
sectional
body
there
were
a
few
delegates
present
representing
an
insignificant
minority
in
the
border
states
delaware
maryland
virginia
kentucky
and
missouri
but
not
one
from
any
state
south
of
the
celebrated
political
line
of
degrees
thirty
minutes
it
had
been
the
invariable
usage
with
nominating
conventions
of
all
parties
to
select
candidates
for
the
presidency
and
one
from
the
north
and
the
other
from
the
south
but
this
assemblage
nominated
lincoln
of
illinois
for
the
first
office
and
for
the
second
hamlin
of
maine
both
northerners
lincoln
its
nominee
for
the
presidency
had
publicly
announced
that
the
union
could
not
permanently
endure
half
slave
and
half
free
the
resolutions
adopted
contained
some
carefully
worded
declarations
well
adapted
to
deceive
the
credulous
who
were
opposed
to
hostile
aggressions
upon
the
rights
of
the
states
in
order
to
accomplish
this
purpose
they
were
compelled
to
create
a
fictitious
issue
in
denouncing
what
they
described
as
the
new
dogma
that
the
constitution
of
its
own
force
carries
slavery
into
any
or
all
of
the
territories
of
the
united
states
a
dogma
which
had
never
been
held
or
declared
by
anybody
and
which
had
no
existence
outside
of
their
own
assertion
there
was
enough
in
connection
with
the
nomination
to
assure
the
most
fanatical
foes
of
the
constitution
that
their
ideas
would
be
the
rule
and
guide
of
the
party
meantime
the
democratic
party
had
held
a
convention
composed
as
usual
of
delegates
from
all
the
states
they
met
in
charleston
south
carolina
on
april
but
an
unfortunate
disagreement
with
regard
to
the
declaration
of
principles
to
be
set
forth
rendered
a
nomination
impracticable
both
divisions
of
the
convention
adjourned
and
met
again
in
baltimore
in
june
then
having
finally
failed
to
come
to
an
agreement
they
separated
and
made
their
respective
nominations
apart
douglas
of
illinois
was
nominated
by
the
friends
of
the
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
with
fitzpatrick
of
alabama
for
the
both
these
gentlemen
at
that
time
were
senators
from
their
respective
states
fitzpatrick
promptly
declined
the
nomination
and
his
place
was
filled
with
the
name
of
herschel
johnson
a
distinguished
citizen
of
georgia
the
convention
representing
the
conservative
or
wing
of
the
the
president
of
which
was
the
hon
caleb
cushing
of
massachusetts
on
the
first
ballot
unanimously
made
choice
of
john
breckinridge
of
kentucky
then
of
the
united
states
for
the
first
office
and
with
like
unanimity
selected
general
joseph
lane
then
a
senator
from
oregon
for
the
second
the
resolutions
of
each
of
these
two
conventions
denounced
the
action
and
policy
of
the
abolition
party
as
subversive
of
the
constitution
and
revolutionary
in
their
tendency
another
convention
was
held
in
baltimore
about
the
same
period
by
those
who
still
adhered
to
the
old
whig
party
reënforced
by
the
remains
of
the
american
organization
and
perhaps
some
others
this
convention
also
consisted
of
delegates
from
all
the
states
and
repudiating
all
geographical
and
sectional
issues
and
declaring
it
to
be
both
the
part
of
patriotism
and
of
duty
to
recognize
no
political
principle
other
than
the
constitution
of
the
country
the
union
of
the
states
and
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
pledged
itself
and
its
supporters
to
maintain
protect
and
defend
separately
and
unitedly
those
great
principles
of
public
liberty
and
national
safety
against
all
enemies
at
home
and
abroad
its
nominees
were
john
bell
of
tennessee
and
edward
everett
of
massachusetts
both
of
whom
had
long
been
distinguished
members
of
the
whig
party
the
people
of
the
united
states
now
had
four
rival
tickets
presented
to
them
by
as
many
contending
parties
whose
respective
position
and
principles
on
the
great
and
absorbing
question
at
issue
may
be
briefly
recapitulated
as
follows
the
party
as
it
was
now
termed
led
by
bell
and
everett
which
ignored
the
territorial
controversy
altogether
and
contented
itself
as
above
stated
with
a
simple
declaration
of
adherence
to
the
constitution
the
union
and
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
party
of
popular
sovereignty
headed
by
douglas
and
johnson
who
affirmed
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
territories
in
their
territorial
condition
to
determine
their
own
organic
institutions
independently
of
the
control
of
congress
denying
the
power
or
duty
of
congress
to
protect
the
persons
or
property
of
individuals
or
minorities
in
such
territories
against
the
action
of
majorities
the
party
supporting
breckinridge
and
lane
who
held
that
the
territories
were
open
to
citizens
of
all
the
states
with
their
property
without
any
inequality
or
discrimination
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
general
government
to
protect
both
persons
and
property
from
aggression
in
the
territories
subject
to
its
control
at
the
same
time
they
admitted
and
asserted
the
right
of
the
people
of
a
territory
on
emerging
from
their
territorial
condition
to
that
of
a
state
to
determine
what
should
then
be
their
domestic
institutions
as
well
as
all
other
questions
of
personal
or
proprietary
right
without
interference
by
congress
and
subject
only
to
the
limitations
and
restrictions
prescribed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
republicans
presenting
the
names
of
lincoln
and
hamlin
who
held
in
the
language
of
one
of
their
leaders
that
slavery
can
exist
only
by
virtue
of
municipal
law
that
there
was
no
law
for
it
in
the
territories
and
no
power
to
enact
one
and
that
congress
was
bound
to
prohibit
it
in
or
exclude
it
from
any
and
every
federal
territory
in
other
words
they
asserted
the
right
and
duty
of
congress
to
exclude
the
citizens
of
half
the
states
of
the
union
from
the
territory
belonging
in
common
to
all
unless
on
condition
of
the
sacrifice
or
abandonment
of
their
property
recognized
by
the
constitution
indeed
of
the
species
of
their
property
distinctly
and
specifically
recognized
as
such
by
that
instrument
on
the
vital
question
underlying
the
whole
controversy
that
is
whether
the
federal
government
should
be
a
government
of
the
whole
for
the
benefit
of
all
its
equal
members
or
if
it
should
continue
to
exist
at
all
a
sectional
government
for
the
benefit
of
a
part
the
first
three
of
the
parties
above
described
were
in
substantial
accord
as
against
the
fourth
if
they
could
or
would
have
acted
unitedly
they
could
certainly
have
carried
the
election
and
averted
the
catastrophe
which
followed
nor
were
efforts
wanting
to
effect
such
a
union
bell
the
whig
candidate
was
a
highly
respectable
and
experienced
statesman
who
had
filled
many
important
offices
both
state
and
federal
he
was
not
ambitious
to
the
extent
of
coveting
the
presidency
and
he
was
profoundly
impressed
by
the
danger
which
threatened
the
country
breckinridge
had
not
anticipated
and
it
may
safely
be
said
did
not
eagerly
desire
the
nomination
he
was
young
enough
to
wait
and
patriotic
enough
to
be
willing
to
do
so
if
the
weal
of
the
country
required
it
thus
much
i
may
confidently
assert
of
both
those
gentlemen
for
each
of
them
authorized
me
to
say
that
he
was
willing
to
withdraw
if
an
arrangement
could
be
effected
by
which
the
divided
forces
of
the
friends
of
the
constitution
could
be
concentrated
upon
some
one
more
generally
acceptable
than
either
of
the
three
who
had
been
presented
to
the
country
when
i
made
this
announcement
to
douglas
with
whom
my
relations
had
always
been
such
as
to
authorize
the
assurance
that
he
could
not
consider
it
as
made
in
an
unfriendly
spirit
he
replied
that
the
scheme
proposed
was
impracticable
because
his
friends
mainly
northern
democrats
if
he
were
withdrawn
would
join
in
the
support
of
lincoln
rather
than
of
any
one
that
should
supplant
douglas
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
his
friends
and
was
sure
they
would
not
accept
the
proposition
it
needed
but
little
knowledge
of
the
of
parties
in
the
several
states
to
foresee
a
probable
defeat
if
the
conservatives
were
to
continue
divided
into
three
parts
and
the
aggressives
were
to
be
held
in
solid
column
but
angry
passions
which
are
always
bad
counselors
had
been
aroused
and
hopes
were
still
cherished
which
proved
to
be
illusory
the
result
was
the
election
by
a
minority
of
a
president
whose
avowed
principles
were
necessarily
fatal
to
the
harmony
of
the
union
of
votes
lincoln
received
but
of
the
suffrage
of
votes
which
the
electors
represented
he
obtained
only
something
over
a
third
of
the
votes
this
discrepancy
was
owing
to
the
system
of
voting
by
general
ticket
that
is
casting
the
state
votes
as
a
unit
whether
unanimous
or
nearly
equally
divided
thus
in
new
york
the
total
popular
vote
was
of
which
were
cast
for
the
republican
or
lincoln
electors
and
against
them
now
york
was
entitled
to
electoral
votes
divided
on
the
basis
of
the
popular
vote
of
these
would
have
been
cast
for
lincoln
and
against
him
but
under
the
general
ticket
system
the
entire
votes
were
cast
for
the
republican
candidates
thus
giving
them
not
only
the
full
strength
of
the
majority
in
their
favor
but
that
of
the
great
minority
against
them
superadded
so
of
other
northern
states
in
which
the
small
majorities
on
one
side
operated
with
the
weight
of
entire
unanimity
while
the
virtual
unanimity
in
the
southern
states
on
the
other
side
counted
nothing
more
than
a
mere
majority
would
have
done
the
manifestations
which
followed
this
result
in
the
southern
states
did
not
proceed
as
has
been
unjustly
charged
from
chagrin
at
their
defeat
in
the
election
or
from
any
personal
hostility
to
the
but
from
the
fact
that
they
recognized
in
him
the
representative
of
a
party
professing
principles
destructive
to
their
peace
their
prosperity
and
their
domestic
tranquillity
the
fire
burst
into
frequent
flame
but
it
was
still
controlled
by
that
love
of
the
union
which
the
south
had
illustrated
in
every
from
boston
to
new
orleans
still
it
was
hoped
against
hope
that
some
adjustment
might
be
made
to
avert
the
calamities
of
a
practical
application
of
the
theory
of
an
irrepressible
conflict
few
if
any
then
doubted
the
right
of
a
state
to
withdraw
its
grants
delegated
to
the
federal
government
or
in
other
words
to
secede
from
the
union
but
in
the
south
this
was
generally
regarded
as
the
remedy
of
last
resort
to
be
applied
only
when
ruin
or
dishonor
was
the
alternative
no
rash
or
revolutionary
action
was
taken
by
the
southern
states
but
the
measures
adopted
were
considerate
and
executed
advisedly
and
deliberately
the
presidential
election
occurred
as
far
as
the
popular
vote
which
determined
the
result
was
concerned
in
november
most
of
the
state
legislatures
convened
soon
afterward
in
regular
session
in
some
cases
special
sessions
were
convoked
for
the
purpose
of
calling
state
conventions
the
recognized
representatives
of
the
sovereign
will
of
the
people
to
be
elected
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
taking
such
action
as
should
be
considered
needful
and
proper
under
the
existing
circumstances
these
conventions
as
it
was
always
held
and
understood
possessed
all
the
power
of
the
people
assembled
in
mass
and
therefore
it
was
conceded
that
they
and
they
only
could
take
action
for
the
withdrawal
of
a
state
from
the
union
the
consent
of
the
respective
states
to
the
formation
of
the
union
had
been
given
through
such
conventions
and
it
was
only
by
the
same
authority
that
it
could
properly
be
revoked
the
time
required
for
this
deliberate
and
formal
process
precludes
the
idea
of
hasty
or
passionate
action
and
none
who
admit
the
primary
power
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
can
consistently
deny
its
validity
and
binding
obligation
upon
every
citizen
of
the
several
states
not
only
was
there
ample
time
for
calm
consideration
among
the
people
of
the
south
but
for
due
reflection
by
the
general
government
and
the
people
of
the
northern
states
president
buchanan
was
in
the
last
year
of
his
administration
his
freedom
from
sectional
asperity
his
long
life
in
the
public
service
and
his
and
conciliatory
character
were
all
guarantees
against
his
precipitating
a
conflict
between
the
federal
government
and
any
of
the
states
but
the
feeble
power
that
he
possessed
in
the
closing
months
of
his
term
to
mold
the
policy
of
the
future
was
painfully
evident
like
all
who
had
intelligently
and
impartially
studied
the
history
of
the
formation
of
the
constitution
he
held
that
the
federal
government
had
no
rightful
power
to
coerce
a
state
like
the
sages
and
patriots
who
had
preceded
him
in
the
high
office
that
he
filled
he
believed
that
our
union
rests
upon
public
opinion
and
can
never
by
cemented
by
the
blood
of
its
citizens
shed
in
civil
war
if
it
can
not
live
in
the
affections
of
the
people
it
must
one
day
perish
congress
may
possess
many
means
of
preserving
it
by
conciliation
but
the
sword
was
not
placed
in
their
hand
to
preserve
it
by
force
message
of
december
ten
years
before
calhoun
addressing
the
senate
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
and
with
that
sincere
desire
to
avert
the
danger
of
disunion
which
those
who
knew
him
best
never
doubted
had
asked
the
emphatic
question
how
can
the
union
be
saved
he
answered
his
question
thus
there
is
but
one
way
by
which
it
can
be
saved
with
any
certainty
and
that
is
by
a
full
and
final
settlement
on
the
principles
of
justice
of
all
the
questions
at
issue
between
the
sections
the
south
asks
for
justice
simple
justice
and
less
she
ought
not
to
take
she
has
no
compromise
to
offer
but
the
constitution
and
no
concession
or
surrender
to
make
can
this
be
done
yes
easily
not
by
the
weaker
party
for
it
can
of
itself
do
nothing
not
even
protect
itself
but
by
the
stronger
but
will
the
north
agree
to
do
this
it
is
for
her
to
answer
this
question
but
i
will
say
she
can
not
refuse
if
she
has
half
the
love
of
the
union
which
she
professes
to
have
nor
without
exposing
herself
to
the
charge
that
her
love
of
power
and
aggrandizement
is
far
greater
than
her
love
of
the
union
during
the
ten
years
that
intervened
between
the
date
of
this
speech
and
the
message
of
buchanan
cited
above
the
progress
of
sectional
discord
and
the
tendency
of
the
stronger
section
to
unconstitutional
aggression
had
been
fearfully
rapid
with
very
rare
exceptions
there
were
none
in
who
claimed
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
apply
coercion
to
a
state
in
men
had
grown
to
be
familiar
with
threats
of
driving
the
south
into
submission
to
any
act
that
the
government
in
the
hands
of
a
northern
majority
might
see
fit
to
perform
during
the
canvass
of
that
year
demonstrations
had
been
made
by
organizations
in
various
parts
of
the
north
which
looked
unmistakably
to
purposes
widely
different
from
those
enunciated
in
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
and
to
the
employment
of
means
not
authorized
by
the
powers
which
the
states
had
delegated
to
the
federal
government
men
still
remembered
that
in
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
a
proposition
was
made
to
authorize
the
employment
of
force
against
a
delinquent
state
on
which
madison
remarked
that
the
use
of
force
against
a
state
would
look
more
like
a
declaration
of
war
than
an
infliction
of
punishment
and
would
probably
be
considered
by
the
party
attacked
as
a
dissolution
of
all
previous
compacts
by
which
it
might
have
been
bound
the
convention
expressly
refused
to
confer
the
power
proposed
and
the
clause
was
lost
while
therefore
in
many
violent
men
appealing
to
passion
and
the
lust
of
power
were
inciting
the
multitude
and
preparing
northern
opinion
to
support
a
war
waged
against
the
southern
states
in
the
event
of
their
secession
there
were
others
who
took
a
different
view
of
the
case
notable
among
such
was
the
new
york
tribune
which
had
been
the
organ
of
the
abolitionists
and
which
now
declared
that
if
the
cotton
states
wished
to
withdraw
from
the
union
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
that
any
attempt
to
compel
them
to
remain
by
force
would
be
contrary
to
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
to
the
fundamental
ideas
upon
which
human
liberty
is
based
and
that
if
the
declaration
of
independence
justified
the
secession
from
the
british
empire
of
three
millions
of
subjects
in
it
was
not
seen
why
it
would
not
justify
the
secession
of
five
millions
of
southerners
from
the
union
in
again
it
was
said
by
the
same
journal
that
sooner
than
compromise
with
the
south
and
abandon
the
chicago
platform
they
would
let
the
union
slide
taunting
expressions
were
freely
used
as
for
example
if
the
southern
people
wish
to
leave
the
union
we
will
do
our
best
to
forward
their
views
all
this
it
must
be
admitted
was
quite
consistent
with
the
declaration
that
the
constitution
was
a
covenant
with
hell
which
stood
as
the
caption
of
a
leading
abolitionist
paper
of
boston
that
signs
of
coming
danger
so
visible
evidences
of
hostility
so
unmistakable
disregard
of
constitutional
obligations
so
wanton
taunts
and
jeers
so
bitter
and
insulting
should
serve
to
increase
excitement
in
the
south
was
a
consequence
flowing
as
much
from
reason
and
patriotism
as
from
sentiment
he
must
have
been
ignorant
of
human
nature
who
did
not
expect
such
a
tree
to
bear
fruits
of
discord
and
division

of

of
efforts
for
an
the
old
year
closes
in
clouds
in
november
after
the
result
of
the
presidential
election
was
known
the
governor
of
mississippi
having
issued
his
proclamation
convoking
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
to
consider
the
propriety
of
calling
a
convention
invited
the
senators
and
representatives
of
the
state
in
congress
to
meet
him
for
consultation
as
to
the
character
of
the
message
he
should
send
to
the
legislature
when
assembled
while
holding
in
common
with
my
political
associates
that
the
right
of
a
state
to
secede
was
unquestionable
i
differed
from
most
of
them
as
to
the
probability
of
our
being
permitted
peaceably
to
exercise
the
right
the
knowledge
acquired
by
the
administration
of
the
war
department
for
four
years
and
by
the
chairmanship
of
the
military
committee
of
the
senate
at
two
different
periods
still
longer
in
combined
duration
had
shown
me
the
entire
lack
of
preparation
for
war
in
the
south
the
foundries
and
armories
were
in
the
northern
states
and
there
were
stored
all
the
new
and
improved
weapons
of
war
in
the
arsenals
of
the
southern
states
were
to
be
found
only
arms
of
the
old
and
rejected
models
the
south
had
no
manufactories
of
powder
and
no
navy
to
protect
our
harbors
no
for
foreign
commerce
it
was
evident
to
me
therefore
that
if
we
should
be
involved
in
war
the
odds
against
us
would
be
far
greater
than
what
was
due
merely
to
our
inferiority
in
population
believing
that
secession
would
be
the
precursor
of
war
between
the
states
i
was
consequently
slower
and
more
reluctant
than
others
who
entertained
a
different
opinion
to
resort
to
that
remedy
while
engaged
in
the
consultation
with
the
governor
just
referred
to
a
telegraphic
message
was
handed
to
me
from
two
members
of
cabinet
urging
me
to
proceed
immediately
to
washington
this
dispatch
was
laid
before
the
governor
and
the
members
of
congress
from
the
state
who
were
in
conference
with
him
and
it
was
decided
that
i
should
comply
with
the
summons
i
was
afterward
informed
that
my
associates
considered
me
too
slow
and
they
were
probably
correct
in
the
belief
that
i
was
behind
the
general
opinion
of
the
people
of
the
state
as
to
the
propriety
of
prompt
secession
on
arrival
at
washington
i
found
as
had
been
anticipated
that
my
presence
there
was
desired
on
account
of
the
influence
which
it
was
supposed
i
might
exercise
with
the
president
buchanan
in
relation
to
his
forthcoming
message
to
congress
on
paying
my
respects
to
the
president
he
told
me
that
he
had
finished
the
rough
draft
of
his
message
but
that
it
was
still
open
to
revision
and
amendment
and
that
he
would
like
to
read
it
to
me
he
did
so
and
very
kindly
accepted
all
the
modifications
which
i
suggested
the
message
was
however
afterward
somewhat
changed
and
with
great
deference
to
the
wisdom
and
statesmanship
of
its
author
i
must
say
that
in
my
judgment
the
last
alterations
were
unfortunate
so
much
so
that
when
it
was
read
in
the
senate
i
was
reluctantly
constrained
to
criticise
it
compared
however
with
documents
of
the
same
class
which
have
since
been
addressed
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
reader
of
presidential
messages
must
regret
that
it
was
not
accepted
by
buchanan
successors
as
a
model
and
that
his
views
of
the
constitution
had
not
been
adopted
as
a
guide
in
the
subsequent
action
of
the
federal
government
the
popular
movement
in
the
south
was
tending
steadily
and
rapidly
toward
the
secession
of
those
known
as
planting
states
yet
when
congress
assembled
on
december
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
all
those
states
took
their
seats
in
the
house
and
they
were
all
represented
in
the
senate
except
south
carolina
whose
senators
had
tendered
their
resignation
to
the
governor
immediately
on
the
announcement
of
the
result
of
the
presidential
election
hopes
were
still
cherished
that
the
northern
leaders
would
appreciate
the
impending
peril
would
cease
to
treat
the
warnings
so
often
given
as
idle
threats
would
refrain
from
the
bravado
so
often
and
so
unwisely
indulged
of
ability
to
whip
the
south
in
thirty
sixty
or
ninety
days
and
would
address
themselves
to
the
more
manly
purpose
of
devising
means
to
allay
the
indignation
and
quiet
the
apprehensions
whether
well
founded
or
not
of
their
southern
brethren
but
the
debates
of
that
session
manifest
on
the
contrary
the
arrogance
of
a
triumphant
party
and
the
determination
to
reap
to
the
uttermost
the
full
harvest
of
a
party
victory
crittenden
of
kentucky
the
oldest
and
one
of
the
most
honored
members
of
the
senate
introduced
into
that
body
a
joint
resolution
proposing
certain
amendments
to
the
constitution
among
them
the
restoration
and
incorporation
into
the
constitution
of
the
geographical
line
of
the
missouri
compromise
with
other
provisions
which
it
was
hoped
might
be
accepted
as
the
basis
for
an
adjustment
of
the
difficulties
rapidly
hurrying
the
union
to
disruption
but
the
earnest
appeals
of
that
venerable
statesman
were
unheeded
by
senators
of
the
republican
party
action
upon
his
proposition
was
postponed
from
time
to
time
on
one
pretext
or
another
until
the
last
day
of
the
session
when
seven
states
had
already
withdrawn
from
the
union
and
established
a
confederation
of
their
own
and
it
was
then
defeated
by
a
majority
of
one
vote
meantime
among
other
propositions
made
in
the
senate
were
two
introduced
early
in
the
session
which
it
may
be
proper
specially
to
mention
one
of
these
was
a
resolution
offered
by
powell
of
kentucky
which
after
some
modification
by
amendment
when
finally
acted
upon
had
taken
the
following
form
that
so
much
of
the
president
message
as
relates
to
the
present
agitated
and
distracted
condition
of
the
country
and
the
grievances
between
the
slaveholding
and
the
holding
states
be
referred
to
a
special
committee
of
thirteen
members
and
that
said
committee
be
instructed
to
inquire
into
the
present
condition
of
the
country
and
report
by
bill
or
otherwise
the
other
was
a
resolution
offered
by
green
of
missouri
to
the
following
effect
that
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
be
instructed
to
inquire
into
the
propriety
of
providing
by
law
for
establishing
an
armed
police
force
at
all
necessary
points
along
the
line
separating
the
slaveholding
states
from
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
general
peace
between
those
states
of
preventing
the
invasion
of
one
state
by
citizens
of
another
and
also
for
the
efficient
execution
of
the
laws
in
the
discussion
of
these
two
resolutions
i
find
in
the
proceedings
of
the
senate
on
december
as
reported
in
the
congressional
globe
some
remarks
of
my
own
the
reproduction
of
which
will
serve
to
exhibit
my
position
at
that
period
a
position
which
has
since
been
often
misrepresented
president
if
the
political
firmament
seemed
to
me
dark
before
there
has
been
little
in
the
discussion
this
morning
to
cheer
or
illumine
it
when
the
proposition
of
the
senator
from
kentucky
was
presented
not
very
hopeful
of
a
good
result
i
was
yet
willing
to
wait
and
see
what
developments
it
might
produce
this
morning
for
the
first
time
it
has
been
considered
and
what
of
encouragement
have
we
received
one
senator
proposes
as
a
cure
for
the
public
evil
impending
over
us
to
invest
the
federal
government
with
such
physical
power
as
properly
belongs
to
monarchy
alone
another
announces
that
his
constituents
cling
to
the
federal
government
if
its
legislative
favors
and
its
treasury
secure
the
works
of
improvement
and
the
facilities
which
they
desire
while
another
rises
to
point
out
that
the
evils
of
the
land
are
of
a
party
character
sir
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
times
indeed
if
the
great
convulsion
which
now
shakes
the
to
its
center
is
to
be
dealt
with
by
such
nostrums
as
these
men
must
look
more
deeply
must
rise
to
a
higher
altitude
like
patriots
they
must
confront
the
danger
face
to
face
if
they
hope
to
relieve
the
evils
which
now
disturb
the
peace
of
the
land
and
threaten
the
destruction
of
our
political
existence
first
of
all
we
must
inquire
what
is
the
cause
of
the
evils
which
beset
us
the
diagnosis
of
the
disease
must
be
stated
before
we
are
prepared
to
prescribe
is
it
the
fault
of
our
legislation
here
if
so
then
it
devolves
upon
us
to
correct
it
and
we
have
the
power
is
it
the
defect
of
the
federal
organization
of
the
fundamental
law
of
our
union
i
hold
that
it
is
not
our
fathers
learning
wisdom
from
the
experiments
of
rome
and
of
greece
the
one
a
consolidated
republic
and
the
other
strictly
a
confederacy
and
taught
by
the
lessons
of
our
own
experiment
under
the
confederation
came
together
to
form
a
constitution
for
more
perfect
union
and
in
my
judgment
made
the
best
government
which
has
ever
been
instituted
by
man
it
only
requires
that
it
should
be
carried
out
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
made
that
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made
should
continue
and
no
evil
can
arise
under
this
government
for
which
it
has
not
an
appropriate
remedy
then
it
is
outside
of
the
government
elsewhere
than
to
its
constitution
or
to
its
administration
that
we
are
to
look
men
must
not
creep
in
the
dust
of
partisan
strife
and
seek
to
make
points
against
opponents
as
the
means
of
evading
or
meeting
the
issues
before
us
the
fault
is
not
in
the
form
of
the
government
nor
does
the
evil
spring
from
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
administered
where
then
is
it
it
is
that
our
fathers
formed
a
government
for
a
union
of
friendly
states
and
though
under
it
the
people
have
been
prosperous
beyond
comparison
with
any
other
whose
career
is
recorded
in
the
history
of
man
still
that
union
of
friendly
states
has
changed
its
character
and
sectional
hostility
has
been
substituted
for
the
fraternity
in
which
the
government
was
founded
i
do
not
intend
here
to
enter
into
a
statement
of
grievances
i
do
not
intend
here
to
renew
that
war
of
crimination
which
for
years
past
has
disturbed
the
country
and
in
which
i
have
taken
a
part
perhaps
more
zealous
than
useful
but
i
call
upon
all
men
who
have
in
their
hearts
a
love
of
the
union
and
whose
service
is
not
merely
that
of
the
lip
to
look
the
question
calmly
but
fully
in
the
face
that
they
may
see
the
true
cause
of
our
danger
which
from
my
examination
i
believe
to
be
that
a
sectional
hostility
has
been
substituted
for
a
general
fraternity
and
thus
the
government
rendered
powerless
for
the
ends
for
which
it
was
instituted
the
hearts
of
a
portion
of
the
people
have
been
perverted
by
that
hostility
so
that
the
powers
delegated
by
the
compact
of
union
are
regarded
not
as
means
to
secure
the
welfare
of
all
but
as
instruments
for
the
destruction
of
a
part
the
minority
section
how
then
have
we
to
provide
a
remedy
by
strengthening
this
government
by
instituting
physical
force
to
overawe
the
states
to
coerce
the
people
living
under
them
as
members
of
sovereign
communities
to
pass
under
the
yoke
of
the
federal
government
no
sir
i
would
have
this
union
severed
into
fragments
sooner
than
have
that
great
evil
befall
constitutional
liberty
and
representative
government
our
government
is
an
agency
of
delegated
and
strictly
limited
powers
its
founders
did
not
look
to
its
preservation
by
force
but
the
chain
they
wove
to
bind
these
states
together
was
one
of
love
and
mutual
good
offices
they
had
broken
the
fetters
of
despotic
power
they
had
separated
themselves
from
the
upon
the
question
of
community
independence
and
their
sons
will
be
degenerate
indeed
if
clinging
to
the
mere
name
and
forms
of
free
government
they
forge
and
rivet
upon
their
posterity
the
fetters
which
their
ancestors
broke
the
remedy
for
these
evils
is
to
be
found
in
the
patriotism
and
the
affection
of
the
people
if
it
exists
and
if
it
does
not
exist
it
is
far
better
instead
of
attempting
to
preserve
a
forced
and
therefore
fruitless
union
that
we
should
peacefully
part
and
each
pursue
his
separate
course
it
is
not
to
this
side
of
the
chamber
that
we
should
look
for
propositions
it
is
not
here
that
we
can
ask
for
remedies
complaints
with
much
amplitude
of
specification
have
gone
forth
from
the
members
on
this
side
of
the
chamber
heretofore
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
they
will
be
renewed
for
the
people
have
taken
the
subject
into
their
own
hands
states
in
their
sovereign
capacity
have
now
resolved
to
judge
of
the
infractions
of
the
federal
compact
and
of
the
mode
and
measure
of
redress
all
we
can
usefully
or
properly
do
is
to
send
to
the
people
thus
preparing
to
act
for
themselves
evidence
of
error
if
error
there
be
to
transmit
to
them
the
proofs
of
kind
feeling
if
it
actuates
the
northern
section
where
they
now
believe
there
is
only
hostility
if
we
are
mistaken
as
to
your
feelings
and
purposes
give
a
substantial
proof
that
here
may
begin
that
circle
which
hence
may
spread
out
and
cover
the
whole
land
with
proofs
of
fraternity
of
a
reaction
in
public
sentiment
and
the
assurance
of
a
future
career
in
conformity
with
the
principles
and
purposes
of
the
constitution
all
else
is
idle
i
would
not
give
the
parchment
on
which
the
bill
would
be
written
that
is
to
secure
our
constitutional
rights
within
the
limits
of
a
state
where
the
people
are
all
opposed
to
the
execution
of
that
law
it
is
a
truism
in
free
governments
that
laws
rest
upon
public
opinion
and
fall
powerless
before
its
determined
opposition
the
time
has
passed
sir
when
appeals
might
profitably
be
made
to
sentiment
the
time
has
come
when
men
must
of
necessity
reason
assemble
facts
and
deal
with
current
events
i
may
be
permitted
in
this
to
correct
an
error
into
which
one
of
my
friends
fell
this
morning
when
he
impressed
on
us
the
great
value
of
our
union
as
measured
by
the
amount
of
time
and
money
and
blood
which
were
spent
to
form
this
union
it
cost
very
little
time
very
little
money
and
no
blood
it
was
one
of
the
most
peaceful
transactions
that
mark
the
pages
of
human
history
our
fathers
fought
the
war
of
the
revolution
to
maintain
the
rights
asserted
in
their
declaration
of
independence
powell
the
senator
from
mississippi
will
allow
me
to
say
that
i
spoke
of
the
government
not
of
the
union
i
said
time
and
money
and
blood
had
been
required
to
form
the
government
davis
the
government
is
the
machinery
established
by
the
constitution
it
is
the
agency
created
by
the
states
when
they
formed
the
union
our
fathers
i
was
proceeding
to
say
having
fought
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
achieved
their
independence
each
state
for
itself
each
state
standing
out
an
integral
part
each
state
separately
recognized
by
the
parent
government
of
great
britain
these
states
as
independent
sovereignties
entered
into
confederate
alliance
after
having
tried
the
confederation
and
found
it
to
be
a
failure
they
of
their
own
accord
came
peacefully
together
and
in
a
brief
period
made
a
constitution
which
was
referred
to
each
state
and
voluntarily
ratified
by
each
state
that
entered
the
union
little
time
little
money
and
no
blood
being
expended
to
form
this
government
the
machine
for
making
the
union
useful
and
beneficial
blood
much
and
precious
was
expended
to
vindicate
and
to
establish
community
independence
and
the
great
american
idea
that
all
governments
rest
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
that
the
people
may
at
their
will
alter
or
abolish
their
government
however
or
by
whomsoever
instituted
but
our
existing
government
is
not
the
less
sacred
to
me
because
it
was
not
sealed
with
blood
i
honor
it
the
more
because
it
was
the
offering
of
men
who
chose
to
live
together
it
rooted
in
fraternity
and
fraternity
supported
its
trunk
and
all
its
branches
every
bud
and
leaflet
depends
entirely
on
the
nurture
it
receives
from
fraternity
as
the
root
of
the
tree
when
that
is
destroyed
the
trunk
decays
and
the
branches
wither
and
the
leaves
fall
and
the
shade
it
was
designed
to
give
has
passed
away
for
ever
i
cling
not
merely
to
the
name
and
form
but
to
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
union
which
our
fathers
made
it
was
for
domestic
tranquillity
not
to
organize
within
one
state
lawless
bands
to
commit
raids
upon
another
it
was
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
not
to
disband
armies
and
navies
lest
they
should
serve
the
protection
of
one
section
of
the
country
better
than
another
it
was
to
bring
the
forces
of
all
the
states
together
to
achieve
a
common
object
upholding
each
the
other
in
amity
and
united
to
repel
exterior
force
all
the
obstructions
existing
between
the
states
were
destroyed
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
transferred
to
the
general
government
every
barrier
to
the
freest
intercourse
was
swept
away
under
the
confederation
it
had
been
secured
as
a
right
to
each
citizen
to
have
free
transit
over
all
the
other
states
and
under
the
union
it
was
designed
to
make
this
more
perfect
is
it
enjoyed
is
it
not
denied
do
we
not
have
mere
speculative
question
of
what
is
property
raised
in
defiance
of
the
clear
intent
of
the
constitution
offending
as
well
against
its
letter
as
against
its
whole
spirit
this
must
be
reformed
or
the
government
our
fathers
instituted
is
destroyed
i
say
then
shall
we
cling
to
the
mere
forms
or
idolize
the
name
of
union
when
its
blessings
are
lost
after
its
spirit
has
fled
who
would
keep
a
flower
which
had
lost
its
beauty
and
its
fragrance
and
in
their
stead
had
formed
a
containing
the
deadliest
poison
or
to
drop
the
figure
who
would
consent
to
remain
in
alliance
with
states
which
used
the
power
thus
acquired
to
invade
his
tranquillity
to
impair
his
defense
to
destroy
his
peace
and
security
any
community
would
be
stronger
standing
in
an
isolated
position
and
using
its
revenues
to
maintain
its
own
physical
force
than
if
allied
with
those
who
would
thus
war
upon
its
prosperity
and
domestic
peace
and
reason
pride
and
the
apprehension
of
secret
constant
danger
would
impel
to
separation
i
do
not
comprehend
the
policy
of
a
southern
senator
who
would
seek
to
change
the
whole
form
of
our
government
and
substitute
federal
force
for
state
obligation
and
authority
do
we
want
a
new
government
that
is
to
overthrow
the
old
do
we
wish
to
erect
a
central
colossus
wielding
at
discretion
the
military
arm
and
exercising
military
force
over
the
people
and
the
states
this
is
not
the
union
to
which
we
were
invited
and
so
carefully
was
this
guarded
that
when
our
fathers
provided
for
using
force
to
put
down
insurrection
they
required
that
the
fact
of
the
insurrection
should
be
communicated
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
before
the
president
could
interpose
when
it
was
proposed
to
give
to
congress
power
to
execute
the
laws
against
a
delinquent
state
it
was
refused
on
the
ground
that
that
would
be
making
war
on
the
states
and
though
i
know
the
good
purpose
of
my
honorable
friend
from
missouri
is
only
to
give
protection
to
constitutional
rights
i
fear
his
proposition
is
to
rear
a
monster
which
will
break
the
feeble
chain
provided
and
destroy
rights
it
was
intended
to
guard
that
military
government
which
he
is
about
to
institute
by
passing
into
hostile
hands
becomes
a
weapon
for
his
destruction
not
for
his
protection
all
dangers
which
we
may
be
called
upon
to
confront
as
independent
communities
are
light
in
my
estimation
compared
with
that
which
would
hang
over
us
if
this
federal
government
had
such
physical
force
if
its
character
was
changed
from
a
representative
agent
of
states
to
a
central
government
with
a
military
power
to
be
used
at
discretion
against
the
states
it
may
be
the
idea
that
it
will
be
used
against
some
state
which
nullifies
the
constitution
and
the
laws
some
state
which
passes
laws
to
obstruct
or
repeal
the
laws
of
the
united
states
some
state
which
in
derogation
of
our
rights
of
transit
under
the
constitution
passes
laws
to
punish
a
citizen
found
there
with
property
recognized
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
prohibited
by
the
laws
of
that
state
but
how
long
might
it
be
before
that
same
military
force
would
be
turned
against
the
minority
section
which
had
sought
its
protection
and
that
minority
thus
become
mere
subjugated
provinces
under
the
great
military
government
that
it
had
thus
contributed
to
establish
the
minority
incapable
of
aggression
is
of
necessity
always
on
the
defensive
and
often
the
victim
of
the
desertion
of
its
followers
and
the
faithlessness
of
its
allies
it
therefore
must
maintain
not
destroy
barriers
i
do
not
know
that
i
fully
appreciate
the
purpose
of
my
friend
from
missouri
whether
when
he
spoke
of
establishing
military
posts
along
the
borders
of
the
states
and
arming
the
federal
government
with
adequate
physical
power
to
enforce
constitutional
rights
i
suppose
he
meant
obligations
he
meant
to
confer
upon
this
federal
government
a
power
which
it
does
not
now
possess
to
coerce
a
state
if
he
did
then
in
the
language
of
madison
he
is
providing
not
for
a
union
of
states
but
for
the
destruction
of
states
he
is
providing
under
the
name
of
union
to
carry
on
a
war
against
states
and
i
care
not
whether
it
be
against
massachusetts
or
missouri
it
is
equally
objectionable
to
me
and
i
will
resist
it
alike
in
the
one
case
and
in
the
other
as
subversive
of
the
great
principle
on
which
our
government
rests
as
a
heresy
to
be
confronted
at
its
first
presentation
and
put
down
there
lest
it
grow
into
proportions
which
will
render
us
powerless
before
it
the
theory
of
our
constitution
president
is
one
of
peace
of
equality
of
sovereign
states
it
was
made
by
states
and
made
for
states
and
for
greater
assurance
they
passed
an
amendment
doing
that
which
was
necessarily
implied
by
the
nature
of
the
instrument
as
it
was
a
mere
instrument
of
grants
but
in
the
abundance
of
caution
they
declared
that
everything
which
had
not
been
delegated
was
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people
that
is
to
the
state
governments
as
instituted
by
the
people
of
each
state
or
to
the
people
in
their
sovereign
capacity
i
need
not
then
go
on
to
argue
from
the
history
and
nature
of
our
government
that
no
power
of
coercion
exists
in
it
it
is
enough
for
me
to
demand
the
clause
of
the
constitution
which
confers
the
power
if
it
is
not
there
the
government
does
not
possess
it
that
is
the
plain
construction
of
the
constitution
made
plainer
if
possible
by
its
amendment
this
union
is
dear
to
me
as
a
union
of
fraternal
states
it
would
lose
its
value
if
i
had
to
regard
it
as
a
union
held
together
by
physical
force
i
would
be
happy
to
know
that
every
state
now
felt
that
fraternity
which
made
this
union
possible
and
if
that
evidence
could
go
out
if
evidence
satisfactory
to
the
people
of
the
south
could
be
given
that
that
feeling
existed
in
the
hearts
of
the
northern
people
you
might
burn
your
and
we
would
cling
to
the
union
still
but
it
is
because
of
their
conviction
that
hostility
and
not
fraternity
now
exists
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
that
they
are
looking
to
their
reserved
rights
and
to
their
independent
powers
for
their
own
protection
if
there
be
any
good
then
which
we
can
do
it
is
by
sending
evidence
to
them
of
that
which
i
fear
does
not
exist
the
purpose
of
your
constituents
to
fulfill
in
the
spirit
of
justice
and
fraternity
all
their
constitutional
obligations
if
you
can
submit
to
them
that
evidence
i
feel
confidence
that
with
the
assurance
that
aggression
is
henceforth
to
cease
will
terminate
all
the
measures
for
defense
upon
you
of
the
majority
section
it
depends
to
restore
peace
and
perpetuate
the
union
of
equal
states
upon
us
of
the
minority
section
rests
the
duty
to
maintain
our
equality
and
community
rights
and
the
means
in
one
case
or
the
other
must
be
such
as
each
can
control
the
resolution
of
powell
was
eventually
adopted
on
the
of
december
and
on
the
the
committee
was
appointed
consisting
of
powell
and
crittenden
of
kentucky
hunter
of
virginia
toombs
of
georgia
davis
of
mississippi
douglas
of
illinois
bigler
of
pennsylvania
rice
of
minnesota
collamer
of
vermont
seward
of
new
york
wade
of
ohio
doolittle
of
wisconsin
and
grimes
of
iowa
the
first
five
of
the
list
as
here
enumerated
were
southern
men
the
next
three
were
northern
democrats
or
conservatives
the
last
five
northern
republicans
so
called
the
supposition
was
that
any
measure
agreed
upon
by
the
representatives
of
the
three
principal
divisions
of
public
opinion
would
be
approved
by
the
senate
and
afterward
ratified
by
the
house
of
representatives
the
committee
therefore
determined
that
a
majority
of
each
of
its
three
divisions
should
be
required
in
order
to
the
adoption
of
any
proposition
presented
the
southern
members
declared
their
readiness
to
accept
any
terms
that
would
secure
the
honor
of
the
southern
states
and
guarantee
their
future
safety
the
northern
democrats
and
crittenden
generally
coöperated
with
the
democrats
of
the
south
but
the
republican
senators
of
the
north
rejected
every
proposition
which
it
was
hoped
might
satisfy
the
southern
people
and
check
the
progress
of
the
secession
movement
after
fruitless
efforts
continued
for
some
ten
days
the
committee
determined
to
report
the
journal
of
their
proceedings
and
announce
their
inability
to
attain
any
satisfactory
conclusion
this
report
was
made
on
the
of
december
the
last
day
of
that
memorable
and
fateful
year
subsequently
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
douglas
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
committee
called
upon
the
opposite
side
to
state
what
they
were
willing
to
do
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
had
rejected
every
proposition
that
promised
pacification
stated
that
toombs
of
georgia
and
davis
of
mississippi
as
members
of
the
committee
had
been
willing
to
renew
the
missouri
compromise
as
a
measure
of
conciliation
but
had
met
no
responsive
willingness
on
the
part
of
their
associates
of
the
opposition
and
he
pressed
the
point
that
as
they
had
rejected
every
overture
made
by
the
friends
of
peace
it
was
now
incumbent
upon
to
make
a
positive
and
affirmative
declaration
of
their
purposes
seward
of
new
york
as
we
have
seen
was
a
member
of
that
committee
the
man
who
in
had
announced
the
irrepressible
conflict
and
who
in
the
same
year
speaking
of
and
for
abolitionism
had
said
it
has
driven
you
back
in
california
and
in
kansas
it
will
invade
your
soil
he
was
to
be
the
secretary
of
state
in
the
incoming
administration
and
was
very
generally
regarded
as
the
power
behind
the
throne
greater
than
the
throne
itself
he
was
present
in
the
senate
but
made
no
response
to
douglas
demand
for
a
declaration
of
policy
meantime
the
efforts
for
an
adjustment
made
in
the
house
of
representatives
had
been
equally
fruitless
conspicuous
among
these
efforts
had
been
the
appointment
of
a
committee
of
members
one
from
each
state
of
the
union
charged
with
a
duty
similar
to
that
imposed
upon
the
committee
of
thirteen
in
the
senate
but
they
had
been
alike
unsuccessful
in
coming
to
any
agreement
it
is
true
that
a
few
days
afterward
they
submitted
a
majority
and
two
minority
reports
and
that
the
report
of
the
majority
was
ultimately
adopted
by
the
house
but
even
if
this
action
had
been
unanimous
and
had
been
taken
in
due
time
it
would
have
been
practically
futile
on
account
of
its
absolute
failure
to
provide
or
suggest
any
solution
of
the
territorial
question
which
was
the
vital
point
in
controversy
no
wonder
then
that
under
the
shadow
of
the
failure
of
every
effort
in
congress
to
find
any
common
ground
on
which
the
sections
could
be
restored
to
amity
the
close
of
the
year
should
have
been
darkened
by
a
cloud
in
the
firmament
which
had
lost
even
the
silver
lining
so
long
seen
or
thought
to
be
seen
by
the
hopeful
footnote
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
of
the
hon
singleton
then
a
representative
of
mississippi
in
the
united
states
congress
in
regard
to
the
subject
treated
is
herewith
annexed
canton
mississippi
in
about
the
time
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
passed
by
the
south
carolina
convention
and
while
mississippi
alabama
and
other
southern
states
were
making
active
preparations
to
follow
her
example
a
conference
of
the
mississippi
delegation
in
congress
senators
and
representatives
was
asked
for
by
governor
pettus
for
consultation
as
to
the
course
mississippi
ought
to
take
in
the
premises
the
meeting
took
place
in
the
fall
of
at
jackson
the
capital
the
whole
delegation
being
present
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
one
representative
the
main
question
for
consideration
was
mississippi
as
soon
as
her
convention
can
meet
pass
an
ordinance
of
secession
thus
placing
herself
by
the
side
of
south
carolina
regardless
of
the
action
of
other
states
or
shall
she
endeavor
to
hold
south
carolina
in
check
and
delay
action
herself
until
other
states
can
get
ready
through
their
conventions
to
unite
with
them
and
then
on
a
given
day
and
at
a
given
hour
by
concert
of
action
all
the
states
willing
to
do
so
secede
in
a
body
upon
the
one
side
it
was
argued
that
south
carolina
could
not
be
induced
to
delay
action
a
single
moment
beyond
the
meeting
of
her
convention
and
that
our
fate
should
be
hers
and
to
delay
action
would
be
to
have
her
crushed
by
the
federal
government
whereas
by
the
earliest
action
possible
we
might
be
able
to
avert
this
calamity
on
the
other
side
it
was
contended
that
delay
might
bring
the
federal
government
to
consider
the
emergency
of
the
case
and
perhaps
a
compromise
could
be
effected
but
if
not
then
the
proposed
concert
of
action
would
at
least
give
dignity
to
the
movement
and
present
an
undivided
southern
front
the
debate
lasted
many
hours
and
davis
with
perhaps
one
other
gentleman
in
that
conference
opposed
immediate
and
separate
state
action
declaring
himself
opposed
to
secession
as
long
as
the
hope
of
a
peaceable
remedy
remained
he
did
not
believe
we
ought
to
precipitate
the
issue
as
he
felt
certain
from
his
knowledge
of
the
people
north
and
south
that
once
there
was
a
clash
of
arms
the
contest
would
be
one
of
the
most
sanguinary
the
world
had
ever
witnessed
a
majority
of
the
meeting
decided
that
no
delay
should
be
interposed
to
separate
state
action
davis
being
on
the
other
side
but
after
the
vote
was
taken
and
the
question
decided
davis
declared
he
would
stand
by
whatever
action
the
convention
representing
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
mississippi
might
think
proper
to
take
after
the
conference
was
ended
several
of
its
members
were
dissatisfied
with
the
course
of
davis
believing
that
he
was
entirely
opposed
to
secession
and
was
seeking
to
delay
action
upon
the
part
of
mississippi
with
the
hope
that
it
might
be
entirely
averted
in
some
unimportant
respects
my
memory
may
be
at
fault
and
possibly
some
of
the
inferences
drawn
may
be
incorrect
but
every
material
statement
made
i
am
sure
is
true

need
can

easily
substantiated

during

this

of

assertion

of
a
purpose
entertained
at
various
times
to
put
it
in
execution
notably
is
this
true
of
massachusetts
and
other
new

states
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
in
had
created
much
dissatisfaction
in
those
states
for
the
reason
expressed
by
an
eminent
citizen
of

that
the
influence
of
our
the
northeastern
part
of
the
union
must
be
diminished
by
the
acquisition
of
more
weight
at
the
other
extremity
the
project
of
a
separation
was
freely
discussed
with
no
intimation
in
the
records
of
the
period
of
any
idea
among
its
advocates
that
it
could
be
regarded
as
treasonable
or
revolutionary
colonel
timothy
pickering
who
had
been
an
officer
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
afterward
successively
secretary
of
war
and
secretary
of
state
in
the
cabinet
of
general
washington
and
still
later
long
a
representative
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
was
one
of
the
leading
secessionists
of
his
day
writing
from
washington
to
a
friend
on
the
of
december
he
says
i
will
not
yet
despair
i
will
rather
anticipate
a
exempt
from
the
corrupt
and
corrupting
influence
and
oppression
of
the
aristocratic
democrats
of
the
south
there
will
be
and
our
children
at
farthest
will
see
it
a
separation
the
white
and
black
population
will
mark
the
boundary
in
another
letter
written
a
few
weeks
afterward
january
speaking
of
what
he
regarded
as
wrongs
and
abuses
perpetrated
by
the
then
existing
administration
he
thus
expresses
his
views
of
the
remedy
to
be
applied
the
principles
of
our
revolution
point
to
the
remedy
that
this
can
be
accomplished
and
without
spilling
one
drop
of
blood
i
have
little
doubt
i
do
not
believe
in
the
practicability
of
a
union
a
would
unite
congenial
characters
and
present
a
fairer
prospect
of
public
happiness
while
the
southern
states
having
a
similarity
of
habits
might
be
left
to
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
way
if
a
separation
were
to
take
place
our
mutual
wants
would
render
a
friendly
and
commercial
intercourse
inevitable
the
southern
states
would
require
the
naval
protection
of
the
and
the
products
of
the
former
would
be
important
to
the
navigation
and
commerce
of
the
latter
it
the
separation
must
begin
in
massachusetts
the
proposition
would
be
welcomed
in
connecticut
and
could
we
doubt
of
new
hampshire
but
new
york
must
be
associated
and
how
is
her
concurrence
to
be
obtained
she
must
be
made

for

mississippi
and

for

vermont
and
rhode
island
kentucky
for
new
jersey
we
find
the
suggestions
of
only
a
reproduction
of
those
thus
outlined
nearly
sixty
years
earlier
pickering
seems
to
have
had
a
correct
and
intelligent
perception
of
the
altogether
pacific
character
of
the
secession
which
he
proposed
and
of
the
mutual
advantages
likely
to
accrue
to
both
sections
from
a
peaceable
separation
writing
in
february
he
explicitly
disavows
the
idea
of
hostile
feeling
or
action
toward
the
south
expressing
himself
as
follows
while
thus
contemplating
the
only
means
of
maintaining
our
ancient
institutions
in
morals
and
religion
and
our
equal
rights
we
wish
no
ill
to
the
southern
states
and
those
naturally
connected
with
them
the
public
debts
might
be
equitably
apportioned
between
the
new
confederacies
and
a
separation
somewhere
about
the
line
above
suggested
would
divide
the
different
characters
of
the
existing
union
the
manners
of
the
eastern
portion
of
the
states
would
be
sufficiently
congenial
to
form
a
union
and
their
interests
are
alike
intimately
connected
with
agriculture
and
commerce
a
friendly
and
commercial
intercourse
would
be
maintained
with
the
states
in
the
southern
confederacy
as
at
present
thus
all
the
advantages
which
have
been
for
a
few
years
depending
on
the
general
union
would
be
continued
to
its
respective
portions
without
the
jealousies
and
enmities
which
now
afflict
both
and
which
peculiarly
embitter
the
condition
of
that
of
the
north
it
is
not
unusual
for
two
friends
when
disagreeing
about
the
mode
of
conducting
a
common
concern
to
separate
and
manage
each
in
his
own
way
his
separate
interest
and
thereby
preserve
a
useful
friendship
which
without
such
separation
would
infallibly
be
destroyed
such
were
the
views
of
an
undoubted
patriot
who
had
participated
in
the
formation
of
the
union
and
who
had
long
been
confidentially
associated
with
washington
in
the
administration
of
its
government
looking
at
the
subject
from
a
northern
standpoint
within
fifteen
years
after
the
organization
of
that
government
under
the
constitution
whether
his
reasons
for
advocating
a
dissolution
of
the
union
were
valid
and
sufficient
or
not
is
another
question
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
discuss
his
authority
is
cited
only
as
showing
the
opinion
prevailing
in
the
north
at
that
day
with
regard
to
the
of
secession
from
the
union
if
deemed
advisable
by
the
ultimate
and
irreversible
judgment
of
the
people
of
a
sovereign
state
in
on
the
bill
for
the
admission
of
louisiana
as
a
state
of
the
union
the
hon
josiah
quincy
a
member
of
congress
from
massachusetts
said
if
this
bill
passes
it
is
my
deliberate
opinion
that
it
is
virtually
a
dissolution
of
this
union
that
it
will
free
the
states
from
their
moral
obligation
and
as
it
will
be
the
right
of
all
so
it
will
be
the
duty
of
some
definitely
to
prepare
for
a
separation
amicably
if
they
can
violently
if
they
must
poindexter
delegate
from
what
was
then
the
mississippi
territory
took
exception
to
these
expressions
of
quincy
and
called
him
to
order
the
speaker
varnum
of
massachusetts
sustained
poindexter
and
decided
that
the
suggestion
of
a
dissolution
of
the
union
was
out
of
order
an
appeal
was
taken
from
this
decision
it
was
quincy
proceeded
to
vindicate
the
propriety
of
his
position
in
a
speech
of
some
length
in
the
course
of
which
he
said
is
there
a
principle
of
public
law
better
settled
or
more
conformable
to
the
plainest
suggestions
of
reason
than
that
the
violation
of
a
contract
by
one
of
the
parties
may
be
considered
as
exempting
the
other
from
its
obligations
suppose
in
private
life
thirteen
form
a
partnership
and
ten
of
them
undertake
to
admit
a
new
partner
without
the
concurrence
of
the
other
three
would
it
not
be
at
their
option
to
abandon
the
partnership
after
so
palpable
an
infringement
of
their
rights
how
much
more
in
the
political
partnership
where
the
admission
of
new
associates
without
previous
authority
is
so
pregnant
with
obvious
dangers
and
evils
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
these
men
cabot
pickering
quincy
and
others
whose
opinions
and
expressions
have
been
cited
were
not
democrats
misled
by
extreme
theories
of
state
rights
but
leaders
and
expositors
of
the
highest
type
of
federalism
and
of
a
strong
central
government
this
fact
gives
their
support
of
the
right
of
secession
the
greater
significance
the
celebrated
hartford
convention
assembled
in
december
it
consisted
of
delegates
chosen
by
the
legislatures
of
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
connecticut
with
an
irregular
or
imperfect
representation
from
the
other
two
new
england
states
new
hampshire
and
vermont
convened
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
grievances
complained
of
by
those
states
in
connection
with
the
war
with
great
britain
they
sat
with
closed
doors
and
the
character
of
their
deliberations
and
discussions
has
not
been
authentically
disclosed
it
was
generally
understood
however
that
the
chief
subject
of
their
considerations
was
the
question
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
states
they
represented
from
the
union
the
decision
as
announced
in
their
published
report
was
adverse
to
the
expediency
of
such
a
measure
at
that
time
and
under
the
then
existing
conditions
but
they
proceeded
to
indicate
the
circumstances
in
which
a
dissolution
of
the
union
might
become
expedient
and
the
mode
in
which
it
should
be
effected
and
their
theoretical
plan
of
separation
corresponds
very
nearly
with
that
actually
adopted
by
the
southern
states
nearly
fifty
years
afterward
they
say
if
the
union
be
destined
to
dissolution
by
reason
of
the
multiplied
abuses
of
bad
administration
it
should
if
possible
be
the
work
of
peaceable
times
and
deliberate
consent
some
form
of
should
be
substituted
among
those
states
which
shall
intend
to
maintain
a
federal
relation
to
each
other
events
may
prove
that
the
causes
of
our
calamities
are
deep
and
permanent
they
may
be
found
to
proceed
not
merely
from
the
blindness
of
prejudice
pride
of
opinion
violence
of
party
spirit
or
the
confusion
of
the
times
but
they
may
be
traced
to
implacable
combinations
of
individuals
or
of
states
to
monopolize
power
and
office
and
to
trample
without
remorse
upon
the
rights
and
interests
of
commercial
sections
of
the
union
whenever
it
shall
appear
that
the
causes
are
radical
and
permanent
a
separation
by
equitable
arrangement
will
be
preferable
to
an
alliance
by
constraint
among
nominal
friends
but
real
enemies
the
omission
of
the
single
word
commercial
which
does
not
affect
the
principle
involved
is
the
only
modification
necessary
to
adapt
this
extract
exactly
to
the
condition
of
the
southern
states
in
the
obloquy
which
has
attached
to
the
members
of
the
hartford
convention
has
resulted
partly
from
a
want
of
exact
knowledge
of
their
proceedings
partly
from
the
secrecy
by
which
they
were
veiled
but
mainly
because
it
was
a
recognized
effort
to
paralyze
the
arm
of
the
federal
government
while
engaged
in
a
war
arising
from
outrages
committed
upon
american
seamen
on
the
decks
of
american
ships
the
indignation
felt
was
no
doubt
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
those
ships
belonged
in
a
great
extent
to
the
people
who
were
now
plotting
against
the
of
the
government
and
indirectly
if
not
directly
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
public
enemy
time
which
has
mollified
passion
and
revealed
many
things
not
then
known
has
largely
modified
the
first
judgment
passed
on
the
proceedings
and
purposes
of
the
hartford
convention
and
but
for
the
circumstances
of
existing
war
which
surrounded
it
they
might
have
been
viewed
as
political
opinions
merely
and
have
received
justification

of

accompanied
by
threats
of
a
dissolution
of

a
resolution
declaring
in

of
that

that

into
a
dissolution

year
february
the

legislature
adopted
and
communicated
to
congress
a
series
of
resolutions
on
the
same
subject
in
one
of
which
it
was
declared
that
as
the
powers
of
legislation
granted
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
congress
do
not
embrace
a
case
of
the
admission
of
a
foreign
state
or
foreign
territory
by
legislation
into
the
union
such
an
act
of
admission
would
have
binding
force
whatever
on
the
people
of
language
which
must
have
meant
that
the
admission
of
texas
would
be
a
justifiable
ground
for
secession
unless
it
was
intended
to
announce
the
purpose
of
nullification
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
people
of
the
south
in
the
crisis
which
confronted
them
in
had
no
lack
either
of
precept
or
of
precedent
for
their
instruction
and
guidance
in
the
teaching
and
the
example
of
our
brethren
of

difference
was
that

north
threatened

were

doubtfully
contemplating
the
probably
impending
necessity
of
taking
the

action
the
efforts
of
southern
men
in
congress
aided
by
the
coöperation
of
the
northern
friends
of
the
constitution
had
failed
by
the
stubborn
refusal
of
a
haughty
majority
controlled
by
radical
purposes
to
yield
anything
to
the
spirit
of
peace
and
conciliation
this
period
coinciding
as
it
happens
with
the
close
of
a
calendar
year
affords
a
convenient
point
to
pause
for
a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
causes
which
had
led
the
southern
states
into
the
attitude
they
then
held
and
for
a
more
full
exposition
of
the
constitutional
questions
involved
the
reader
of
many
of
the
treatises
on
these
events
which
have
been
put
forth
as
historical
if
dependent
upon
such
alone
for
information
might
naturally
enough
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
controversies
which
arose
between
the
states
and
the
war
in
which
they
culminated
were
caused
by
efforts
on
the
one
side
to
extend
and
perpetuate
human
slavery
and
on
the
other
to
resist
it
and
establish
human
liberty
the
southern
states
and
southern
people
have
been
sedulously
represented
as
propagandists
of
slavery
and
the
northern
as
the
defenders
and
champions
of
universal
freedom
and
this
view
has
been
so
arrogantly
assumed
so
dogmatically
asserted
and
so
persistently
reiterated
that
its
authors
have
in
many
cases
perhaps
succeeded
in
bringing
themselves
to
believe
it
as
well
as
in
impressing
it
widely
upon
the
world
the
attentive
reader
of
the
preceding
chapters
especially
if
he
has
compared
their
statements
with
contemporaneous
records
and
other
original
sources
of
information
will
already
have
found
evidence
enough
to
enable
him
to
discern
the
falsehood
of
these
representations
and
to
perceive
that
to
whatever
extent
the
question
of
slavery
may
have
served
as
an
it
was
far
from
being
the
of
the
conflict
i
have
not
attempted
and
shall
not
permit
myself
to
be
drawn
into
any
discussion
of
the
merits
or
demerits
of
slavery
as
an
ethical
or
even
as
a
political
question
it
would
be
foreign
to
my
purpose
irrelevant
to
my
subject
and
would
only
serve
as
it
has
invariably
served
in
the
hands
of
its
agitators
to
darken
counsel
and
divert
attention
from
the
genuine
issues
involved
as
a
mere
historical
fact
we
have
seen
that
african
servitude
among
us
confessedly
the
mildest
and
most
humane
of
all
institutions
to
which
the
name
slavery
has
ever
been
applied
existed
in
all
the
original
states
and
that
it
was
recognized
and
protected
in
the
fourth
article
of
the
constitution
subsequently
for
climatic
industrial
and
economical
not
moral
or
sentimental
reasons
it
was
abolished
in
the
northern
while
it
continued
to
exist
in
the
southern
states
men
differed
in
their
views
as
to
the
abstract
question
of
its
right
or
wrong
but
for
two
generations
after
the
revolution
there
was
no
geographical
line
of
demarkation
for
such
differences
the
african
was
carried
on
almost
exclusively
by
new
england
merchants
and
northern
ships
jefferson
a
southern
man
the
founder
of
the
democratic
party
and
the
vindicator
of
state
rights
was
in
theory
a
consistent
enemy
to
every
form
of
slavery
the
southern
states
took
the
lead
in
prohibiting
the
and
as
we
have
seen
one
of
them
georgia
was
the
first
state
to
incorporate
such
a
prohibition
in
her
organic
constitution
eleven
years
after
the
agitation
on
the
missouri
question
when
the
subject
first
took
a
sectional
shape
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
proposed
and
earnestly
debated
in
the
virginia
legislature
and
its
advocates
were
so
near
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
that
a
declaration
in
its
favor
was
defeated
only
by
a
small
majority
and
that
on
the
ground
of
expediency
at
a
still
later
period
abolitionist
lecturers
and
teachers
were
mobbed
assaulted
and
threatened
with
tar
and
feathers
in
new
york
pennsylvania
massachusetts
new
hampshire
connecticut
and
other
states
one
of
them
lovejoy
was
actually
killed
by
a
mob
in
illinois
as
late
as
these
facts
prove
incontestably
that
the
sectional
hostility
which
exhibited
itself
in
on
the
application
of
missouri
for
admission
into
the
union
which
again
broke
out
on
the
proposition
for
the
annexation
of
texas
in
and
which
reappeared
after
the
mexican
war
never
again
to
be
suppressed
until
its
fell
results
had
been
fully
accomplished
was
not
the
consequence
of
any
difference
on
the
abstract
question
of
slavery
it
was
the
offspring
of
sectional
rivalry
and
political
ambition
it
would
have
manifested
itself
just
as
certainly
if
slavery
had
existed
in
all
the
states
or
if
there
had
not
been
a
negro
in
america
no
such
pretension
was
made
in
or
when
the
louisiana
purchase
and
afterward
the
admission
into
the
union
of
the
state
of
that
name
elicited
threats
of
disunion
from
the
representatives
of
new
england
the
complaint
was
not
of
slavery
but
of
the
acquisition
of
more
weight
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
union
it
was
not
slavery
that
threatened
a
rupture
in
but
the
unjust
and
unequal
operation
of
a
protective
tariff
it
happened
however
on
all
these
occasions
that
the
line
of
demarkation
of
sectional
interests
coincided
exactly
or
very
nearly
with
that
dividing
the
states
in
which
negro
servitude
existed
from
those
in
which
it
had
been
abolished
it
corresponded
with
the
prediction
of
pickering
in
that
in
the
separation
certainly
to
come
the
white
and
black
population
would
mark
the
boundary
a
prediction
made
without
any
reference
to
slavery
as
a
source
of
dissension
of
course
the
diversity
of
institutions
contributed
in
some
minor
degree
to
the
conflict
of
interests
there
is
an
action
and
reaction
of
cause
and
consequence
which
limits
and
modifies
any
general
statement
of
a
political
truth
i
am
stating
general
principles
not
defining
modifications
and
exceptions
with
the
precision
of
a
mathematical
proposition
or
a
bill
in
chancery
the
truth
remains
intact
and
incontrovertible
that
the
existence
of
african
servitude
was
in
no
wise
the
cause
of
the
conflict
but
only
an
incident
in
the
later
controversies
that
arose
however
its
effect
in
operating
as
a
lever
upon
the
passions
prejudices
or
sympathies
of
mankind
was
so
potent
that
it
has
been
spread
like
a
thick
cloud
over
the
whole
horizon
of
historic
truth
as
for
the
institution
of
negro
servitude
it
was
a
matter
entirely
subject
to
the
control
of
the
states
no
power
was
ever
given
to
the
general
government
to
interfere
with
it
but
an
obligation
was
imposed
to
protect
it
its
existence
and
validity
were
distinctly
recognized
by
the
constitution
in
at
least
three
places
first
in
that
part
of
the
second
section
of
the
first
article
which
prescribes
that
representatives
and
direct
taxes
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
which
may
be
included
within
this
union
according
to
their
respective
members
which
shall
be
determined
by
adding
to
the
whole
number
of
free
persons
including
those
bound
to
service
for
a
term
of
years
and
excluding
indians
not
taxed
three
fifths
of
all
other
persons
persons
than
persons
and
those
bound
to
service
for
a
term
of
years
must
of
course
have
meant
those
permanently
bound
to
service
secondly
it
was
recognized
by
the
ninth
section
of
the
same
article
which
provided
that
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
shall
not
be
prohibited
by
congress
prior
to
the
year
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
eight
this
was
a
provision
inserted
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
new
england
states
forbidding
any
prohibition
of
the
trade
by
congress
for
twenty
years
and
thus
virtually
giving
sanction
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
demand
which
that
trade
was
prosecuted
to
supply
and
which
was
its
only
object
again
and
in
the
third
place
it
was
specially
recognized
and
an
obligation
imposed
upon
every
state
not
only
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
it
in
any
other
state
but
in
certain
cases
to
aid
in
its
enforcement
by
that
clause
or
paragraph
of
the
second
section
of
the
fourth
article
which
provides
as
follows
no
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
under
the
laws
thereof
escaping
into
another
shall
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
such
service
or
labor
but
shall
be
delivered
up
on
claim
of
the
party
to
whom
such
service
or
labor
may
be
due
the
president
and
of
the
united
states
every
senator
and
representative
in
congress
the
members
of
every
state
legislature
and
all
executive
and
judicial
officers
both
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
states
were
required
to
take
an
oath
or
affirmation
to
support
the
constitution
containing
these
provisions
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
those
who
considered
them
in
conflict
with
the
higher
law
of
religion
or
morality
might
refuse
to
take
such
an
oath
or
hold
such
an
office
as
the
members
of
some
religious
sects
refuse
to
take
any
oath
at
all
or
to
bear
arms
in
the
service
of
their
country
but
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
with
the
obligations
of
honor
or
honesty
the
conduct
of
those
who
having
taken
such
an
oath
made
use
of
the
powers
and
opportunities
of
the
offices
held
under
its
sanctions
to
nullify
its
obligations
and
neutralize
its
guarantees
the
halls
of
congress
afforded
the
from
which
assaults
were
made
upon
these
guarantees
the
legislatures
of
various
northern
states
enacted
laws
to
hinder
the
execution
of
the
provisions
made
for
the
rendition
of
fugitives
from
service
state
officials
lent
their
aid
to
the
work
of
thwarting
them
and
city
mobs
assailed
the
officers
engaged
in
the
duty
of
enforcing
them
with
regard
to
the
provision
of
the
constitution
above
quoted
for
the
restoration
of
fugitives
from
service
or
labor
my
own
view
was
and
is
that
it
was
not
a
proper
subject
for
legislation
by
the
federal
congress
but
that
its
enforcement
should
have
been
left
to
the
respective
states
which
as
parties
to
the
compact
of
union
should
have
been
held
accountable
for
its
fulfillment
such
was
actually
the
case
in
the
earlier
and
better
days
of
the
republic
no
fugitive
existed
or
was
required
for
two
years
after
the
organization
of
the
federal
government
and
when
one
was
then
passed
it
was
merely
as
an
incidental
appendage
to
an
act
regulating
the
mode
of
rendition
of
fugitives
from
not
from
service
or
labor
in
a
more
elaborate
law
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
celebrated
compromise
of
that
year
but
the
very
fact
that
the
federal
government
had
taken
the
matter
into
its
own
hands
and
provided
for
its
execution
by
its
own
officers
afforded
a
sort
of
pretext
to
those
states
which
had
now
become
hostile
to
this
provision
of
the
constitution
not
only
to
stand
aloof
but
in
some
cases
to
adopt
measures
generally
known
as
personal
liberty
laws
directly
in
conflict
with
the
execution
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
declared
the
object
of
its
founders
to
be
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
now
however
in
the
people
of
a
portion
of
the
states
had
assumed
an
attitude
of
avowed
hostility
not
only
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
itself
but
to
the
domestic
tranquillity
of
the
people
of
other
states
long
before
the
formation
of
the
constitution
one
of
the
charges
preferred
in
the
declaration
of
independence
against
the
government
of
great
britain
as
justifying
the
separation
of
the
colonies
from
that
country
was
that
of
having
excited
domestic
insurrections
among
us
now
the
mails
were
burdened
with
incendiary
publications
secret
emissaries
had
been
sent
and
in
one
case
an
armed
invasion
of
one
of
the
states
had
taken
place
for
the
very
purpose
of
exciting
domestic
insurrection
it
was
not
the
passage
of
the
personal
liberty
laws
it
was
not
the
circulation
of
incendiary
documents
it
was
not
the
raid
of
john
brown
it
was
not
the
operation
of
unjust
and
unequal
tariff
laws
nor
all
combined
that
constituted
the
intolerable
grievance
but
it
was
the
systematic
and
persistent
struggle
to
deprive
the
southern
states
of
equality
in
the
union
generally
to
discriminate
in
legislation
against
the
interests
of
their
people
culminating
in
their
exclusion
from
the
territories
the
common
property
of
the
states
as
well
as
by
the
infraction
of
their
compact
to
promote
domestic
tranquillity
the
question
with
regard
to
the
territories
has
been
discussed
in
the
foregoing
chapters
and
the
argument
need
not
be
repeated
there
was
however
one
feature
of
it
which
has
not
been
specially
noticed
although
it
occupied
a
large
share
of
public
attention
at
the
time
and
constituted
an
important
element
in
the
case
this
was
the
action
of
the
federal
judiciary
thereon
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
received
in
a
case
the
dred
scott
case
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
involving
the
whole
question
of
the
of
the
african
race
and
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
southern
states
to
migrate
to
the
territories
temporarily
or
permanently
with
their
slave
property
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
citizens
of
other
states
with
property
of
any
sort
this
question
as
we
have
seen
had
already
been
the
subject
of
long
and
energetic
discussion
without
any
satisfactory
conclusion
all
parties
however
had
united
in
declaring
that
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
highest
judicial
tribunal
in
the
land
would
be
accepted
as
final
after
long
and
patient
consideration
of
the
case
in
the
decision
of
the
court
was
pronounced
in
an
elaborate
and
exhaustive
opinion
delivered
by
taney
a
man
eminent
as
a
lawyer
great
as
a
statesman
and
stainless
in
his
moral
reputation
seven
of
the
nine
judges
who
composed
the
court
concurring
in
it
the
salient
points
established
by
this
decision
were
that
persons
of
the
african
race
were
not
and
could
not
be
acknowledged
as
part
of
the
people
or
citizens
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
congress
had
no
right
to
exclude
citizens
of
the
south
from
taking
their
negro
servants
as
any
other
property
into
any
part
of
the
common
territory
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
claim
its
protection
therein
and
finally
as
a
consequence
of
the
principle
just
above
stated
that
the
missouri
compromise
of
in
so
far
as
it
prohibited
the
existence
of
african
servitude
north
of
a
designated
line
was
unconstitutional
and
void
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
had
already
been
declared
inoperative
and
void
by
the
bill
of
instead
of
accepting
the
decision
of
this
then
august
tribunal
the
ultimate
authority
in
the
interpretation
of
constitutional
questions
as
conclusive
of
a
controversy
that
had
so
long
disturbed
the
peace
and
was
threatening
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
it
was
flouted
denounced
and
utterly
disregarded
by
the
northern
agitators
and
served
only
to
stimulate
the
intensity
of
their
sectional
hostility
what
resource
for
justice
what
assurance
of
tranquillity
what
guarantee
of
safety
now
remained
for
the
south
still
forbearing
still
hoping
still
striving
for
peace
and
union
we
waited
until
a
sectional
president
nominated
by
a
sectional
convention
elected
by
a
sectional
vote
and
that
the
vote
of
a
minority
of
the
people
was
about
to
be
inducted
into
office
under
the
warning
of
his
own
distinct
announcement
that
the
union
could
not
permanently
endure
half
slave
and
half
free
meaning
thereby
that
it
could
not
continue
to
exist
in
the
condition
in
which
it
was
formed
and
its
constitution
adopted
the
leader
of
his
party
who
was
to
be
the
chief
of
his
cabinet
was
the
man
who
had
first
proclaimed
an
irrepressible
conflict
between
the
north
and
the
south
and
who
had
declared
that
abolitionism
having
triumphed
in
the
territories
would
proceed
to
the
invasion
of
the
states
even
then
the
southern
people
did
not
finally
despair
until
the
temper
of
the
triumphant
party
had
been
tested
in
congress
and
found
adverse
to
any
terms
of
reconciliation
consistent
with
the
honor
and
safety
of
all
parties
no
alternative
remained
except
to
seek
the
security
out
of
the
union
which
they
had
vainly
tried
to
obtain
within
it
the
hope
of
our
people
may
be
stated
in
a
sentence
it
was
to
escape
from
injury
and
strife
in
the
union
to
find
prosperity
and
peace
out
of
it
the
mode
and
principles
of
their
action
will
next
be
presented

there
was
but
little
necessity
in
those
times
nor
long
after
for
an
act
of
congress
to
authorize
the
recovery
of
fugitive
slaves
the
laws
of
the
free
states
and
still
more
the
force
of
public
opinion
were
the
owners
best
safeguards
public
opinion
was
against
the
abduction
of
slaves
and
if
any
one
was
seduced
from
his
owner
it
was
done
furtively
and
secretly
without
show
or
force
and
as
any
other
moral
offense
would
be
committed
state
laws
favored
the
owner
and
to
a
greater
extent
than
the
act
of
congress
did
or
could
in

there
was
an
act
it
was
passed
in

only
repealed
in
discriminating
between
the
traveler

sojourner
and
the
permanent
resident
allowing
the
former
to
remain
six
months
in
the
state
before
his
slaves
would
become
subject
to
the
emancipation
laws

in
the
case
of
a

officer
allowing
as
much

required

was
nine
months

by

opinion
the
traveler

sojourner
was
safe
with
his

determined

not

that
this
was
not

a
foreign
view
is
evident
from
the
second
of
the
articles
of

between
the
states
adopted
subsequently
to
the
declaration
of
independence
which
is
in
these
words
each

these

the

they
were

eleven
of
the
original
states
in
and
by
the
other
two
in
the
course
of
the
three
years
next
ensuing
and
continued
in
force
until
during
this
period
the
general
government
was
vested
in
the
congress
alone
in
which
each
state
through
its
representatives
had
an
equal
vote
in
the
determination
of
all
questions
whatever
the
congress
exercised
all
the
executive
as
well
as
legislative
powers
delegated
by
the
states
when
not
in
session
the
general
management
of
affairs
was
intrusted
to
a
committee
of
the
states
consisting
of
one
delegate
from
each
state
provision
was
made
for
the
creation
by
the
congress
of
courts
having
a
certain
specified
jurisdiction
in
admiralty
and
maritime
cases
and
for
the
settlement
of
controversies
between
two
or
more
states
in
a
mode
specifically
prescribed
the
government
thus
constituted
was
found
inadequate
for
some
necessary
purposes
and
it
became
requisite
to
reorganize
it
the
first
idea
of
such
reorganization
arose
from
the
necessity
of
regulating
the
commercial
intercourse
of
the
states
with
one
another
and
with
foreign
countries
and
also
of
making
some
provision
for
payment
of
the
debt
contracted
during
the
war
for
independence
these
exigencies
led
to
a
proposition
for
a
meeting
of
commissioners
from
the
various
states
to
consider
the
subject
such
a
meeting
was
held
at
annapolis
in
september
but
as
only
five
states
new
york
new
jersey
delaware
pennsylvania
and
virginia
were
represented
the
commissioners
declined
to
take
any
action
further
than
to
recommend
another
convention
with
a
wider
scope
for
consideration
as
they
expressed
it
it
was
their
unanimous
conviction
that
it
may
essentially
tend
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
union
if
the
states
by
whom
they
have
been
respectively
delegated
would
themselves
concur
and
use
their
endeavors
to
procure
the
concurrence
of
the
other
states
in
the
appointment
of
commissioners
to
meet
at
philadelphia
on
the
second
monday
in
may
next
to
take
into
consideration
the
situation
of
the
united
states
to
devise
such
further
provisions
as
shall
appear
to
them
necessary
to
render
the
constitution
of
the
federal
government
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
the
union
and
to
report
such
an
act
for
that
purpose
to
the
united
states
in
congress
assembled
as
when
agreed
to
by
them
and
afterward
confirmed
by
the
legislatures
of
every
state
will
effectually
provide
for
the
same
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
the
terms
constitution
of
the
federal
government
employed
above
and
federal
constitution
as
used
in
other
proceedings
of
that
period
do
not
mean
the
instrument
to
which
we
now
apply
them
and
which
was
not
then
in
existence
they
were
applied
to
the
system
of
government
formulated
in
the
articles
of
confederation
this
is
in
strict
accord
with
the
definition
of
the
word
constitution
given
by
an
eminent
lexicographer
the
body
of
fundamental
laws
as
contained
in
written
documents
or
prescriptive
usage
which
constitute
the
form
of
government
for
a
nation
state
community
association
or
society
thus
we
speak
of
the
british
constitution
which
is
an
unwritten
system
of
prescriptive
usage
of
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
or
of
mississippi
which
is
the
fundamental
or
organic
law
of
a
particular
state
embodied
in
a
written
instrument
and
of
the
federal
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
fundamental
law
of
an
association
of
states
at
first
as
embraced
in
the
articles
of
confederation
and
afterward
as
revised
amended
enlarged
and
embodied
in
the
instrument
framed
in
and
subsequently
adopted
by
the
various
states
the
manner
in
which
this
revision
was
effected
was
as
follows
acting
on
the
suggestion
of
the
annapolis
convention
the
congress
on
the
of
the
ensuing
february
adopted
the
following
resolution
that
in
the
opinion
of
congress
it
is
expedient
that
on
the
second
monday
in
may
next
a
convention
of
delegates
who
shall
have
been
appointed
by
the
several
states
be
held
at
philadelphia
for
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
and
reporting
to
congress
and
the
several
legislatures
such
alterations
and
provisions
therein
as
shall
when
agreed
to
in
congress
and
confirmed
by
the
states
render
the
federal
constitution
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
the
language
of
this
resolution
substantially
according
with
that
of
the
recommendation
made
by
the
commissioners
at
annapolis
a
few
months
before
very
clearly
defines
the
objects
of
the
proposed
convention
and
the
powers
which
it
was
thought
advisable
that
the
states
should
confer
upon
their
delegates
these
were
solely
and
expressly
as
follows
to
revise
the
articles
of
confederation
with
reference
to
the
of
the
united
states
to
devise
such
alterations
and
provisions
therein
as
should
seem
to
them
requisite
in
order
to
render
federal
constitution
or
of
the
federal
government
adequate
to
exigencies
of
the
union
or
exigencies
of
the
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
to
report
the
result
of
their
deliberations
that
is
the
and
provisions
which
they
should
agree
to
recommend
to
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
of
course
their
action
could
be
only
advisory
until
ratified
by
the
states
the
articles
of
confederation
and
perpetual
union
under
which
the
states
were
already
united
provided
that
no
alteration
should
be
made
in
any
of
them
unless
such
alteration
be
agreed
to
in
a
congress
of
the
united
states
and
afterward
confirmed
by
the
legislatures
of
every
state
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
with
the
exception
of
rhode
island
adopted
and
proceeded
to
act
upon
these
suggestions
by
the
appointment
of
delegates
some
of
them
immediately
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
annapolis
commissioners
in
advance
of
that
of
the
congress
and
the
others
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
after
the
resolution
adopted
by
congress
the
instructions
given
to
these
delegates
in
all
cases
conformed
to
the
recommendations
which
have
been
quoted
and
in
one
case
imposed
an
additional
restriction
or
limitation
as
this
is
a
matter
of
much
importance
in
order
to
a
right
understanding
of
what
follows
it
may
be
advisable
to
cite
in
detail
the
action
of
the
several
states
italicizing
such
passages
as
are
specially
significant
of
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
delegates
to
the
convention
the

assembly
of

after
reciting
the
recommendation
made
at
annapolis
enacted
that
seven
commissioners
be
appointed
by
joint
ballot
of
both
houses
of

who
or
any
three
of
them
are
hereby
authorized

from

to
meet
such

as
may
be
appointed
and
authorized
by
other
states
to
assemble
in
convention
at

as
above
recommended
and
to
join
with

like

in

instructed

at

the
purpose
of
revising
the
federal
and
to
join
with
them
in
considering
such
alterations
and
further
provisions
the
remainder
of
their
instructions
being
in
the
same
words
as
those
given
to
the
georgia
delegates
the
instructions
given
to
the
deputies
of
delaware
were
substantially
in
accord
with
the
others
being
almost
literally
identical
with
those
of
pennsylvania
but
the
following
proviso
was
added
so
always
and
provided
that
such
alterations
or
further
provisions
or
any
of
them
do
not
extend
to
that
part
of
the
fifth
article
of
the
confederation
of
the
said
states
finally
ratified
on
the
first
day
of
march
in
the
year
which
declares
that
determining
questions
in
the
united
states
in
congress
assembled
each
state
shall
have
one
rhode
island
as
has
already
been
mentioned
sent
no
delegates
from
an
examination
and
comparison
of
the
enactments
and
instructions
above
quoted
we
may
derive
certain
conclusions
so
obvious
that
they
need
only
to
be
stated
in
the
first
place
it
is
clear
that
the
delegates
to
the
convention
of
represented
not
people
of
the
united
in
mass
as
has
been
most
absurdly
contended
by
some
political
writers
but
of
the
several
states
just
as
in
the
congress
of
that
period
delaware
with
her
sixty
thousand
inhabitants
having
entire
equality
with
pennsylvania
which
had
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
or
virginia
with
her
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
object
for
which
they
were
appointed
was
not
to
organize
a
government
but
solely
and
expressly
to
amend
the
federal
constitution
already
existing
in
other
words
to
revise
the
articles
of
confederation
and
to
suggest
such
alterations
or
additional
provisions
as
should
be
deemed
necessary
to
render
them
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
the
union
it
is
evident
that
the
term
federal
constitution
or
its
equivalent
constitution
of
the
federal
government
was
as
freely
and
familiarly
applied
to
the
system
of
government
established
by
the
articles
of
confederation
undeniably
a
league
or
compact
between
states
expressly
retaining
their
sovereignty
and
independence
as
to
that
amended
system
which
was
substituted
for
it
by
the
constitution
that
superseded
those
articles
the
functions
of
the
delegates
to
the
convention
were
of
course
only
to
devise
deliberate
and
discuss
no
validity
could
attach
to
any
action
taken
unless
and
until
it
should
be
afterward
ratified
by
the
several
states
it
is
evident
also
that
what
was
contemplated
was
the
process
provided
in
the
articles
of
confederation
for
their
own
amendment
first
a
recommendation
by
the
congress
and
afterward
ratification
by
the
legislatures
of
every
state
before
the
amendment
should
be
obligatory
upon
any
the
departure
from
this
condition
which
actually
occurred
will
presently
be
noticed

this
definition
is
very
good
as
far
as
it
goes
but
the
form
of
government
is
a
phrase
which
falls
short
of
expressing
all
that
should
be
comprehended
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
which
constitute

the
work
before
it
would
take
a
wider
range
and
involve
more
radical
changes
in
the
federal
constitution
than
had
at
first
been
contemplated
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
general
government
was
obliged
to
rely
upon
the
governments
of
the
several
states
for
the
execution
of
its
enactments
except
its
own
officers
and
employees
and
in
time
of
war
the
federal
army
and
navy
it
could
exercise
no
control
upon
individual
citizens
with
regard
to
the
states
no
compulsory
or
coercive
measures
could
be
employed
to
enforce
its
authority
in
case
of
opposition
or
indifference
to
its
exercise
this
last
was
a
feature
of
the
confederation
which
it
was
not
desirable
nor
possible
to
change
and
no
objection
was
made
to
it
but
it
was
generally
admitted
that
some
machinery
should
be
devised
to
enable
the
general
government
to
exercise
its
legitimate
functions
by
means
of
a
mandatory
authority
operating
directly
upon
the
individual
citizens
within
the
limits
of
its
constitutional
powers
the
necessity
for
such
provision
was
undisputed
beyond
the
common
ground
of
a
recognition
of
this
necessity
there
was
a
wide
diversity
of
opinion
among
the
members
of
the
convention
luther
martin
a
delegate
from
maryland
in
an
account
of
its
proceedings
afterward
given
to
the
legislature
of
that
state
classifies
these
differences
as
constituting
three
parties
in
the
convention
which
he
describes
as
follows
one
party
whose
object
and
wish
it
was
to
abolish
and
annihilate
all
state
governments
and
to
bring
forward
one
general
government
over
this
extensive
continent
of
a
monarchical
nature
under
certain
restrictions
and
limitations
those
who
openly
avowed
this
sentiment
were
it
is
true
but
few
yet
it
is
equally
true
that
there
was
a
considerable
number
who
did
not
openly
avow
it
who
were
by
myself
and
many
others
of
the
convention
considered
as
being
in
reality
favorers
of
that
sentiment
the
second
party
was
not
for
the
abolition
of
the
state
governments
nor
for
the
introduction
of
a
monarchical
government
under
any
form
but
they
wished
to
establish
such
a
system
as
could
give
their
own
states
undue
power
and
influence
in
the
government
over
the
other
states
a
third
party
was
what
i
considered
truly
federal
and
republican
this
party
was
nearly
equal
in
number
with
the
other
two
and
was
composed
of
the
delegates
from
connecticut
new
york
new
jersey
delaware
and
in
part
from
maryland
also
of
some
individuals
from
other
representations
this
party
were
for
proceeding
upon
terms
of
federal
equality
they
were
for
taking
our
present
federal
system
as
the
basis
of
their
proceedings
and
as
far
as
experience
had
shown
that
other
powers
were
necessary
to
the
federal
government
to
give
those
powers
they
considered
this
the
object
for
which
they
were
sent
by
their
states
and
what
their
states
expected
from
them
in
his
account
of
the
second
party
above
described
martin
refers
to
those
representatives
of
the
larger
states
who
wished
to
establish
a
numerical
basis
of
representation
in
the
congress
instead
of
the
equal
representation
of
the
states
whether
large
or
small
which
existed
under
the
articles
of
confederation
there
was
naturally
much
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
greater
states
virginia
pennsylvania
north
carolina
and
massachusetts
whose
population
at
that
period
exceeded
that
of
all
the
others
combined
but
which
in
the
congress
constituted
less
than
one
third
of
the
voting
strength
on
the
other
hand
the
smaller
states
were
tenacious
of
their
equality
in
the
union
of
the
very
smallest
one
as
we
have
seen
had
sent
no
representatives
to
the
convention
and
the
other
had
instructed
her
delegates
unconditionally
to
insist
upon
the
maintenance
of
absolute
equality
in
the
congress
this
difference
gave
more
trouble
than
any
other
question
that
came
before
the
convention
and
for
some
time
threatened
to
prove
irreconcilable
and
to
hinder
any
final
agreement
it
was
ultimately
settled
by
a
compromise
provision
was
made
for
the
representation
of
the
people
of
the
states
in
one
branch
of
the
federal
legislature
the
house
of
representatives
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
in
the
other
branch
the
senate
for
the
equal
representation
of
the
states
as
such
the
perpetuity
of
this
equality
was
furthermore
guaranteed
by
a
stipulation
that
no
state
should
ever
be
deprived
of
its
equal
suffrage
in
the
senate
without
its
own
consent
this
compromise
required
no
sacrifice
of
principle
on
either
side
and
no
provision
of
the
constitution
has
in
practice
proved
more
entirely
satisfactory
it
is
not
necessary
and
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
to
undertake
to
give
a
history
of
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
of
that
may
be
obtained
from
other
sources
all
that
is
requisite
for
the
present
purpose
is
to
notice
a
few
particulars
of
special
significance
or
relevancy
to
the
subject
of
inquiry
early
in
the
session
of
the
convention
a
series
of
resolutions
was
introduced
by
edmund
randolph
of
virginia
embodying
a
proposed
plan
of
government
which
were
considered
in
committee
of
the
whole
house
and
formed
the
basis
of
a
protracted
discussion
the
first
of
these
resolutions
as
amended
before
a
vote
was
taken
was
in
these
words
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
committee
that
a
national
government
ought
to
be
established
consisting
of
a
supreme
legislative
executive
and
judiciary
this
was
followed
by
other
resolutions
in
all
as
adopted
and
reported
by
the
committee
in
which
the
word
national
occurred
times
the
day
after
the
report
of
the
committee
was
made
ellsworth
of
connecticut
moved
to
strike
out
the
words
national
government
in
the
resolution
above
quoted
and
to
insert
the
words
government
of
the
united
states
which
he
said
was
the
proper
title
he
wished
also
the
plan
to
go
forth
as
an
amendment
of
the
articles
of
confederation
that
is
to
say
he
wished
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
undertaking
to
form
a
government
instead
of
reforming
the
old
one
which
was
the
proper
object
of
the
convention
this
motion
was
agreed
to
without
opposition
and
as
a
consequence
the
word
national
was
stricken
out
wherever
it
occurred
and
nowhere
makes
its
appearance
in
the
constitution
finally
adopted
the
prompt
rejection
after
introduction
of
this
word
national
is
obviously
much
more
expressive
of
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
authors
of
the
constitution
than
its
mere
absence
from
the
constitution
would
have
been
it
is
a
clear
indication
that
they
did
not
mean
to
give
any
countenance
to
the
idea
which
scotched
not
killed
has
again
reared
its
mischievous
crest
in
these
latter
days
that
the
government
which
they
organized
was
a
consolidated
instead
of
a
confederacy
of
sovereign
members
continuing
their
great
work
of
revision
and
reorganization
the
convention
proceeded
to
construct
the
framework
of
a
government
for
the
confederacy
strictly
confined
to
certain
specified
and
limited
powers
but
complete
in
all
its
parts
legislative
executive
and
judicial
and
provided
with
the
means
for
discharging
all
its
functions
without
interfering
with
the
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
of
the
constituent
states
all
this
might
have
been
done
without
going
beyond
the
limits
of
their
commission
to
revise
the
articles
of
confederation
and
to
consider
and
report
such
alterations
and
provisions
as
might
seem
necessary
to
render
the
federal
constitution
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
a
serious
difficulty
however
was
foreseen
the
thirteenth
and
last
of
the
aforesaid
articles
had
this
provision
which
has
already
been
referred
to
the
articles
of
this
confederation
be
inviolably
observed
by
every
state
and
the
union
shall
be
perpetual
nor
shall
any
alteration
at
any
time
hereafter
be
made
in
any
of
unless
such
alteration
be
agreed
to
in
a
congress
of
the
united
states
and
be
afterward
confirmed
by
the
legislatures
of
it
is
obvious
from
an
examination
of
the
records
as
has
already
been
shown
that
the
original
idea
in
calling
a
convention
was
that
their
recommendations
should
take
the
course
prescribed
by
this
article
first
a
report
to
the
congress
and
then
if
approved
by
that
body
a
submission
to
the
various
legislatures
for
final
action
there
was
no
reason
to
apprehend
the
of
congress
in
which
a
mere
majority
would
determine
the
question
but
the
consent
of
the
legislatures
of
was
requisite
in
order
to
final
ratification
and
there
was
serious
reason
to
fear
that
this
consent
could
not
be
obtained
rhode
island
as
we
have
seen
had
declined
to
send
any
representatives
to
the
convention
of
the
three
delegates
from
new
york
two
had
withdrawn
and
other
indications
of
dissatisfaction
had
appeared
in
case
of
the
failure
of
a
single
legislature
to
ratify
the
labors
of
the
convention
would
go
for
naught
under
a
strict
adherence
to
the
letter
of
the
article
above
cited
the
danger
of
a
total
frustration
of
their
efforts
was
imminent
in
this
emergency
the
convention
took
the
responsibility
of
transcending
the
limits
of
their
instructions
and
recommending
a
procedure
which
was
in
direct
contravention
of
the
letter
of
the
articles
of
confederation
this
was
the
introduction
of
a
provision
into
the
new
constitution
that
the
ratification
of
states
should
be
sufficient
for
its
establishment
among
themselves
in
order
to
validate
this
provision
it
was
necessary
to
refer
it
to
authority
higher
than
that
of
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
that
is
to
the
people
of
the
states
assembled
by
their
representatives
in
convention
hence
it
was
provided
by
the
seventh
and
last
article
of
the
new
constitution
that
the
ratification
of
the
of
nine
states
should
suffice
for
its
establishment
between
the
states
so
ratifying
the
same
there
was
another
reason
of
a
more
general
and
perhaps
more
controlling
character
for
this
reference
to
conventions
for
ratification
even
if
entire
unanimity
of
the
state
legislatures
could
have
been
expected
under
the
american
theory
of
republican
government
conventions
of
the
people
duly
elected
and
accredited
as
such
are
invested
with
the
plenary
power
inherent
in
the
people
of
an
organized
and
independent
community
assembled
in
mass
in
other
words
they
represent
and
exercise
what
is
properly
the
of
the
people
state
legislatures
with
restricted
powers
do
not
possess
or
represent
sovereignty
still
less
does
the
congress
of
a
union
or
confederacy
of
states
which
is
by
two
degrees
removed
from
the
seat
of
sovereignty
we
sometimes
read
or
hear
of
delegated
sovereignty
divided
sovereignty
with
other
loose
expressions
of
the
same
sort
but
no
such
thing
as
a
division
or
delegation
of
sovereignty
is
possible
in
order
therefore
to
supersede
the
restraining
article
above
cited
and
to
give
the
highest
validity
to
the
compact
for
the
delegation
of
important
powers
and
functions
of
government
to
a
common
agent
an
authority
above
that
of
the
state
legislatures
was
necessary
madison
in
the
federalist
says
it
has
been
heretofore
noted
among
the
defects
of
the
confederation
that
in
many
of
the
states
it
had
received
no
higher
sanction
than
a
mere
legislative
ratification
this
objection
would
of
course
have
applied
with
greater
force
to
the
proposed
constitution
which
provided
for
additional
grants
of
power
from
the
states
and
the
conferring
of
larger
and
more
varied
powers
upon
a
general
government
which
was
to
act
upon
individuals
instead
of
states
if
the
question
of
its
confirmation
had
been
submitted
merely
to
the
several
state
legislatures
hence
the
obvious
propriety
of
referring
it
to
the
respective
of
the
states
in
their
sovereign
capacity
as
provided
in
the
final
article
of
the
constitution
in
this
article
provision
was
deliberately
made
for
the
if
necessary
of
a
part
of
the
states
from
a
union
which
when
formed
had
been
declared
perpetual
and
its
terms
and
articles
to
be
inviolably
observed
by
every
state
opposition
was
made
to
the
provision
on
this
very
ground
that
it
was
virtually
a
dissolution
of
the
union
and
that
it
would
furnish
a
precedent
for
future
secessions
gerry
a
distinguished
member
from
massachusetts
afterward
of
the
united
states
said
if
nine
out
of
thirteen
states
can
dissolve
the
compact
six
out
of
nine
will
be
just
as
able
to
dissolve
the
future
one
hereafter
madison
who
was
one
of
the
leading
members
of
the
convention
advocating
afterward
in
the
federalist
the
adoption
of
the
new
constitution
asks
the
question
on
what
principle
the
confederation
which
stands
in
the
solemn
form
of
a
compact
among
the
states
can
be
superseded
without
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
parties
to
it
he
answers
this
question
by
recurring
to
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
case
to
the
great
principle
of
to
the
transcendent
law
of
nature
and
of
nature
god
which
declares
that
the
safety
and
happiness
of
society
are
the
objects
at
which
all
political
institutions
aim
and
to
which
all
such
institutions
must
be
sacrificed
he
proceeds
however
to
give
other
grounds
of
justification
it
is
an
established
doctrine
on
the
subject
of
treaties
that
all
the
articles
are
mutually
conditions
of
each
other
that
a
breach
of
any
one
article
is
a
breach
of
the
whole
treaty
and
that
a
breach
committed
by
either
of
the
parties
absolves
the
others
and
authorizes
them
if
they
please
to
pronounce
the
compact
violated
and
void
should
it
unhappily
be
necessary
to
appeal
to
these
delicate
truths
for
a
justification
for
dispensing
with
the
consent
of
particular
states
to
a
dissolution
of
the
federal
pact
will
not
the
complaining
parties
find
it
a
difficult
task
to
answer
the
multiplied
and
important
infractions
with
which
they
may
be
confronted
time
has
been
when
it
was
incumbent
on
us
all
to
veil
the
ideas
which
this
paragraph
the
scene
is
now
changed
and
with
it
the
part
which
the
same
motives
dictate
madison
idea
of
the
propriety
of
any
statement
of
the
right
of
secession
until
the
occasion
arises
for
its
exercise
whether
right
or
wrong
in
itself
is
eminently
suggestive
as
explanatory
of
the
caution
exhibited
by
other
statesmen
of
that
period
as
well
as
himself
with
regard
to
that
delicate
truth
the
only
possible
alternative
to
the
view
here
taken
of
the
seventh
article
of
the
constitution
as
a
provision
for
the
secession
of
any
nine
states
which
might
think
proper
to
avail
themselves
of
it
from
union
with
such
as
should
refuse
to
do
so
and
the
formation
of
an
amended
or
more
perfect
union
with
one
another
is
to
regard
it
as
a
provision
for
the
continuance
of
the
old
union
or
confederation
under
altered
conditions
by
the
majority
which
should
accede
to
them
with
a
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
recusant
minority
to
withdraw
secede
or
stand
aloof
the
idea
of
compelling
any
state
or
states
to
enter
into
or
to
continue
in
union
with
the
others
by
is
as
absolutely
excluded
under
the
one
supposition
as
under
the
other
with
reference
to
one
state
or
a
minority
of
states
as
well
as
with
regard
to
a
majority
the
article
declares
that
the
ratification
of
the
conventions
of
nine
states
shall
be
sufficient
for
the
establishment
of
this
constitution
not
between
all
but
the
states
so
ratifying
the
it
is
submitted
whether
a
fuller
justification
of
this
right
of
the
nine
states
to
form
a
new
government
is
not
found
in
the
fact
of
the
sovereignty
in
each
of
them
making
them
a
law
unto
themselves
and
therefore
the
final
judge
of
what
the
necessities
of
each
community
demand
here
although
perhaps
in
advance
of
its
proper
place
in
the
argument
the
attention
of
the
reader
may
be
directed
to
the
refutation
afforded
by
this
article
of
the
constitution
of
that
astonishing
fiction
which
has
been
put
forward
by
some
distinguished
writers
of
later
date
that
the
constitution
was
established
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
if
such
had
been
the
case
the
will
of
a
majority
duly
ascertained
and
expressed
would
have
been
binding
upon
the
minority
no
such
idea
existed
in
its
formation
it
was
not
even
established
by
the
in
the
nor
was
it
proposed
that
it
should
be
it
was
submitted
for
the
acceptance
of
each
separately
the
time
and
place
at
their
own
option
so
that
the
dates
of
ratification
did
extend
from
december
to
may
the
long
period
required
for
these
ratifications
makes
manifest
the
absurdity
of
the
assertion
that
it
was
a
decision
by
the
votes
of
one
people
or
one
community
in
which
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
determined
the
result
we
have
seen
that
the
delegates
to
the
convention
of
were
chosen
by
the
several
states
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
they
voted
in
the
convention
as
in
the
federal
congress
by
states
each
state
casting
one
vote
we
have
seen
also
that
they
were
sent
for
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
and
devising
means
for
rendering
the
federal
constitution
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
that
the
terms

united

federal
constitution
and
constitution
of
the
federal
government
were
applied
to
the
old
confederation
in
precisely
the
same
sense
in
which
they
are
used
under
the
new
that
the
proposition
to
constitute
a
national
government
was
distinctly
rejected
by
the
convention
that
the
right
of
any
state
or
states
to
withdraw
from
union
with
the
others
was
practically
exemplified
and
that
the
idea
of
coercion
of
a
state
or
compulsory
measures
was
distinctly
excluded
under
any
construction
that
can
be
put
upon
the
action
of
the
convention
to
the
original
copy
of

forth

implied
that

was
done

of

positively
rejected

by

the
declarations
with
which
it

of
them

worthy
of
attention
delaware
was
the
first
to
act
her
convention
met
on
december
and
ratified
the
constitution
on
the
the
readiness
of
this
least
in
population
and
next
to
the
least
in
territorial
extent
of
all
the
states
to
accept
that
instrument
is
a
very
significant
fact
when
we
remember
the
jealous
care
with
which
she
had
guarded
against
any
infringement
of
her
sovereign
statehood
delaware
alone
had
given
special
instructions
to
her
deputies
in
the
convention
not
to
consent
to
any
sacrifice
of
the
principle
of
equal
representation
in
congress
the
promptness
and
unanimity
of
her
people
in
adopting
the
new
constitution
prove
very
clearly
not
only
that
they
were
satisfied
with
the
preservation
of
that
principle
in
the
federal
senate
but
that
they
did
not
understand
the
constitution
in
any
of
its
features
as
compromising
the
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
which
she
had
so
especially
cherished

these
words
by
these
presents
do
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
same
and
for
ourselves
assent
to
and
ratify
the
foregoing
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
in
new
jersey
the
ratification
which
took
place
on
the
of
december
was
unanimous
this
is
no
less
significant
and
instructive
than
the
unanimity
of
delaware
from
the
fact
that
the
new
jersey
delegation
in
the
convention
that
framed
the
constitution
had
taken
the
lead
in
behalf
of
the
federal
or
idea
in
opposition
to
that
of
nationalism
or
consolidation
william
patterson
a
distinguished
citizen
afterward
governor
of
new
jersey
had
introduced
into
that
convention
what
was
known
as
the
jersey
plan
embodying
these
principles
as
distinguished
from
the
various
national
plans
presented
in
defending
them
he
had
said
after
calling
for
the
reading
of
the
credentials
of
delegates
can
we
on
this
ground
form
a
national
government
i
fancy
not
our
commissions
give
a
complexion
to
the
business
and
can
we
suppose
that
when
we
exceed
the
bounds
of
our
duty
the
people
will
approve
our
proceedings
we
are
met
here
as
the
deputies
of
independent
sovereign
states
for
federal
purposes
can
we
consolidate
their
sovereignty
and
form
one
and
annihilate
the
sovereignties
of
our
states
who
have
sent
us
here
for
other
purposes
again
on
a
subsequent
day
after
stating
that
he
was
not
there
to
pursue
his
own
sentiments
of
government
but
of
those
who
had
sent
him
he
had
asked
can
we
representatives
of
independent
annihilate
the
essential
powers
of
independency
are
not
the
votes
of
this
convention
taken
on
every
question
under
the
idea
of
independency
the
fact
that
this
state
which
through
her
representatives
had
taken
so
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
maintenance
of
the
principle
of
state
sovereignty
ratified
the
constitution
with
such
readiness
and
unanimity
is
conclusive
proof
that
in
her
opinion
that
principle
was
not
compromised
thereby
the
conclusion
of
her
ordinance
of
ratification
is
in
these
words
now
be
it
known
that
we
the
delegates
of
state
of
new
chosen
by
the
people
thereof
for
the
purpose
aforesaid
having
maturely
deliberated
on
and
considered
the
aforesaid
proposed
constitution
do
hereby
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
of
the
said
state
of
new
agree
to
ratify
and
confirm
the
same
and
every
part
thereof
done
in
convention
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
members
present
this
day
of
december
d
georgia
next
and
also
unanimously
on
january
declared
through
delegates
of
the
state
of
in
convention
met
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
the
legislature
aforesaid
in
virtue
of
the
powers
and
authority
given
us
them
by
people
of
the
said
for
that
purpose
that
they
did
fully
and
entirely
assent
to
ratify
and
adopt
the
said
constitution
connecticut
on
the
of
january
declares
her
assent
with
equal
distinctness
of
assertion
as
to
the
source
of
the
authority
in
the
name
of
people
of
the
state
of
we
the
delegates
of
people
of
the
said
in
general
convention
assembled
pursuant
to
an
act
of
the
legislature
in
october
last
do
assent
to
ratify
and
adopt
the
constitution
reported
by
the
convention
of
delegates
in
philadelphia
in
massachusetts
there
was
a
sharp
contest
the
people
of
that
state
were
then
as
for
a
long
time
afterward
exceedingly
tenacious
of
their
state
independence
and
sovereignty
the
proposed
constitution
was
subjected
to
a
close
critical
and
rigorous
examination
with
reference
to
its
bearing
upon
this
very
point
the
convention
was
a
large
one
and
some
of
its
leading
members
were
very
distrustful
of
the
instrument
under
their
consideration
it
was
ultimately
adopted
by
a
very
close
vote
to
and
then
only
as
accompanied
by
certain
proposed
amendments
the
object
of
which
was
to
guard
more
expressly
against
any
sacrifice
or
compromise
of
state
sovereignty
and
under
an
assurance
given
by
the
advocates
of
the
constitution
of
the
certainty
that
those
amendments
would
be
adopted
the
most
strenuously
urged
of
these
was
that
ultimately
adopted
in
substance
as
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
was
intended
to
take
the
place
of
the
second
article
of
confederation
as
an
emphatic
assertion
of
the
continued
freedom
sovereignty
and
independence
of
the
states
this
will
be
considered
more
particularly
hereafter
in
terms
substantially
identical
with
those
employed
by
the
other
states
massachusetts
thus
announced
her
ratification
in
convention
of
the
delegates
of
people
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
convention
having
impartially
discussed
and
fully
considered
the
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
reported
etc
do
in
the
name
and
in
behalf
of
people
of
the
commonwealth
of
assent
to
and
ratify
the
said
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
this
was
accomplished
on
february
maryland
followed
on
the
of
april
and
south
carolina
on
the
of
may
in
equivalent
expressions
the
ratification
of
the
former
being
made
by
the
delegates
of
people
of
speaking
as
they
declared
for
ourselves
and
in
the
name
and
on
the
behalf
of
people
of
this
that
of
the
latter
in
convention
of
people
of
the
state
of
south
by
their
representatives
in
the
name
and
behalf
of
people
of
this
but
south
carolina
like
massachusetts
demanded
certain
amendments
and
for
greater
assurance
accompanied
her
ordinance
of
ratification
with
the
following
distinct
assertion
of
the
principle
afterward
embodied
in
the
tenth
amendment
this
convention
doth
also
declare
that
section
or
of
the
said
constitution
warrants
a
construction
that
states
do
not
retain
every
power
not
expressly
relinquished
by
and
vested
in
the
general
government
of
the
union
the
delegates
of
people
of
the
state
of
new
in
convention
on
the
of
june
in
the
name
and
behalf
of
people
of
the
state
of
new
declared
their
approval
and
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
this
state
also
the
opposition
was
formidable
the
final
vote
being
to
and
as
in
south
carolina
it
was
explicitly
declared
that
all
powers
not
expressly
and
particularly
delegated
by
the
aforesaid
constitution
are
reserved
to
the
several
states
to
be
by
them
exercised
the
debates
in
the
virginia
convention
were
long
and
animated
some
of
the
most
eminent
and
most
gifted
men
of
that
period
took
part
in
them
and
they
have
ever
since
been
referred
to
for
the
exposition
which
they
afford
of
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
by
its
authors
and
their
contemporaries
among
the
members
were
madison
mason
and
randolph
who
had
also
been
members
of
the
convention
at
philadelphia
madison
was
one
of
the
most
earnest
advocates
of
the
new
constitution
while
mason
was
as
warmly
opposed
to
its
adoption
so
also
was
patrick
henry
the
celebrated
orator
it
was
assailed
with
great
vehemence
at
every
vulnerable
or
doubtful
point
and
was
finally
ratified
june
by
a
vote
of
to
a
majority
of
only
ten
this
ratification
was
expressed
in
the
same
terms
employed
by
other
states
by
the
delegates
of
people
of
in
the
name
and
in
behalf
of
people
of
in
so
doing
however
like
massachusetts
new
hampshire
and
south
carolina
virginia
demanded
certain
amendments
as
a
more
explicit
guarantee
against
consolidation
and
accompanied
the
demand
with
the
following
declaration
that
the
powers
granted
under
the
constitution
being
derived
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
may
be
resumed
by
them
whenever
the
same
shall
be
perverted
to
their
injury
or
oppression
and
that
every
power
not
granted
thereby
remains
with
them
and
at
their
will
etc
whether
in
speaking
of
a
possible
of
powers
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
convention
had
in
mind
the
action
of
such
a
people
the
political
community
which
did
not
exist
and
of
which
they
could
hardly
have
entertained
even
an
ideal
conception
or
of
the
people
of
virginia
for
whom
they
were
speaking
and
of
the
other
united
states
then
taking
similar
action
is
a
question
which
scarcely
admits
of
argument
but
which
will
be
more
fully
considered
in
the
proper
place
new
york
the
eleventh
state
to
signify
her
assent
did
so
on
july
after
an
arduous
and
protracted
discussion
and
then
by
a
majority
of
but
three
votes
to
even
this
small
majority
was
secured
only
by
the
recommendation
of
certain
material
amendments
the
adoption
of
which
by
the
other
states
it
was
at
first
proposed
to
make
a
condition
precedent
to
the
validity
of
the
ratification
this
idea
was
abandoned
after
a
correspondence
between
hamilton
and
madison
and
instead
of
conditional
ratification
new
york
provided
for
the
resumption
of
her
grants
but
the
amendments
were
put
forth
with
a
circular
letter
to
the
other
states
in
which
it
was
declared
that
nothing
but
the
fullest
confidence
of
obtaining
a
revision
of
the
objectionable
features
of
the
constitution
and
an
invincible
reluctance
to
separating
from
our
sister
states
could
have
prevailed
upon
a
sufficient
number
to
ratify
it
without
stipulating
for
previous
amendments
the
ratification
was
expressed
in
the
usual
terms
as
made
the
delegates
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
in
the
name
and
in
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
said
state
accompanying
it
was
a
declaration
of
the
principles
in
which
the
assent
of
new
york
was
conceded
one
paragraph
of
which
runs
as
follows
that
the
powers
of
government
may
be
by
the
people
whensoever
it
shall
become
necessary
to
their
happiness
that
every
power
jurisdiction
and
right
which
is
not
by
the
said
constitution
clearly
delegated
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
the
departments
of
the
government
thereof
remains
to
the
people
of
the
several
or
to
their
respective
state
governments
to
whom
they
may
have
granted
the
same
and
that
those
clauses
in
the
said
constitution
which
declare
that
congress
shall
not
have
or
exercise
certain
powers
do
not
imply
that
congress
is
entitled
to
any
powers
not
given
by
the
said
constitution
but
such
clauses
are
to
be
construed
either
as
exceptions
to
certain
specified
powers
or
as
inserted
for
greater
caution
the
acceptance
of
these
eleven
states
having
been
signified
to
the
congress
provision
was
made
for
putting
the
new
constitution
in
operation
this
was
effected
on
march
when
the
government
was
organized
with
george
washington
as
president
and
john
adams
the
senators
and
representatives
elected
by
the
states
which
had
acceded
to
the
constitution
organizing
themselves
as
a
congress
meantime
two
states
were
standing
as
we
have
seen
unquestioned
and
unmolested
in
an
attitude
of
absolute
independence
the
convention
of
north
carolina
on
august
had
rejected
the
proposed
constitution
or
more
properly
speaking
had
withheld
her
ratification
until
action
could
be
taken
upon
the
of
the
following
resolution
adopted
by
her
convention
that
a
declaration
of
rights
asserting
and
securing
from
encroachment
the
great
principles
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
the
unalienable
rights
of
the
people
together
with
amendments
to
the
most
ambiguous
and
exceptionable
parts
of
the
said
constitution
of
government
ought
to
be
laid
before
congress
and
the
convention
of
the
states
that
shall
or
may
be
called
for
the
purpose
of
amending
the
said
constitution
for
their
consideration
previous
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
aforesaid
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
more
than
a
year
afterward
when
the
newly
organized
government
had
been
in
operation
for
nearly
nine
months
and
when
although
no
convention
of
the
states
had
been
called
to
revise
the
constitution
north
carolina
had
good
reason
to
feel
assured
that
the
most
important
provisions
of
her
proposed
amendments
and
declaration
of
rights
would
be
adopted
she
acceded
to
the
amended
compact
on
november
her
convention
agreed
in
behalf
of
the
freemen
citizens
and
inhabitants
of
state
of
north
to
adopt
and
ratify
the
constitution
in
rhode
island
the
proposed
constitution
was
at
first
submitted
to
a
direct
vote
of
the
people
who
rejected
it
by
an
overwhelming
majority
subsequently
that
is
on
may
when
the
reorganized
government
had
been
in
operation
for
nearly
fifteen
months
and
when
it
had
become
reasonably
certain
that
the
amendments
thought
necessary
would
be
adopted
a
convention
of
the
people
of
rhode
island
acceded
to
the
new
union
and
ratified
the
constitution
though
even
then
by
a
majority
of
only
two
votes
in
to
the
ratification
was
expressed
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
that
which
has
now
been
so
repeatedly
cited
we
the
delegates
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
providence
plantations
duly
elected
and
met
in
convention
in
the
name
and
behalf
of
people
of
rhode
island
and
providence
do
by
these
presents
assent
to
and
ratify
the
said
constitution
it
is
particularly
to
be
noted
that
during
the
intervals
between
the
organization
of
the
federal
government
under
the
new
constitution
and
the
ratification
of
that
constitution
by
north
carolina
and
rhode
island
respectively
those
states
were
absolutely
independent
and
unconnected
with
any
other
political
community
unless
they
be
considered
as
still
representing
the
united
states
of
america
which
by
the
articles
of
confederation
had
been
declared
a
perpetual
union
the
other
states
had
seceded
from
the
former
union
not
in
a
body
but
separately
each
for
itself
and
had
formed
a
new
association
leaving
these
two
states
in
the
attitude
of
foreign
though
friendly
powers
there
was
no
claim
of
any
right
to
control
their
action
as
if
they
had
been
mere
geographical
or
political
divisions
of
one
great
consolidated
community
or
nation
their
accession
to
the
union
was
desired
but
their
freedom
of
choice
in
the
matter
was
never
questioned
and
then
it
is
to
be
noted
on
part
that
like
the
house
of
judah
they
refrained
from
any
attempt
to
force
the
seceding
sisters
to
return
as
illustrative
of
the
relations
existing
during
this
period
between
the
united
states
and
rhode
island
it
may
not
be
uninstructive
to
refer
to
a
letter
sent
by
the
government
of
the
latter
to
the
president
and
congress
and
transmitted
by
the
president
to
the
senate
with
the
following
note
united
states
gentlemen
of
the

having
yesterday
received
a
letter

in

at
the
request
and
in
behalf
of

the
critical
situation
in
which
the
people
of

are
placed
engages
us
to
make
these
assurances
on
their
behalf
of
their
attachment
and
friendship
to
their
sister
states
and
of
their
disposition
to
cultivate
mutual
harmony
and
friendly
intercourse
they
know
themselves
to
be
a
handful
comparatively
viewed
and
although
they
now
stand
as
it
were
alone
they
have
not
separated
themselves
or
departed
from
the
principles
of
that
confederation
which
was
formed
by
the
sister
states
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
and
in
the
hour
of
danger
our
not
having
acceded
to
or
adopted
the
new
system
of
government
formed
and
adopted
by
most
of
our
sister
states
we
doubt
not
has
given
uneasiness
to
them
that
we
have
not
seen
our
way
clear
to
it
consistently
with
our
idea
of
the
principles
upon
which
we
all
embarked
together
has
also
given
pain
to
us
we
have
not
doubted
that
we
might
thereby
avoid
present
difficulties
but
we
have
apprehended
future
mischief
can
it
be
thought
strange
that
with
these
impressions
they
the
people
of
this
state
should
wait
to
see
the
proposed
system
organized
and
in
operation
to
see
what
further
checks
and
securities
would
be
agreed
to
and
established
by
way
of
amendments
before
they
could
adopt
it
as
a
constitution
of
government
for
themselves
and
their
posterity
we
are
induced
to
hope
that
we
shall
not
be
altogether
considered
as
foreigners
having
no
particular
affinity
or
connection
with
the
united
states
but
that
trade
and
commerce
upon
which
the
prosperity
of
this
state
much
depends
will
be
preserved
as
free
and
open
between
this
state
and
the
united
states
as
our
different
situations
at
present
can
possibly
admit
we
feel
ourselves
attached

the

miscellaneous
chapter
iv
the

not
adopted
by

in

a
great
fallacy
mistake
of
judge
colonial
the
united

of

independence
of
communities
traced
from
germany
to
great
britain
and
from
great

to
mr

provincial
people
origin
and
continuance
of
the
title
united
states
no
such
political
community
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
historical
retrospect
of
the
last
three
chapters
and
the
extracts
from
the
records
of
a
generation
now
departed
have
been
presented
as
necessary
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
nature
and
principles
of
the
compact
of
on
which
depended
the
questions
at
issue
in
the
secession
of
and
the
contest
that
ensued
between
the
states
we
have
seen
that
the
united
colonies
when
they
declared
their
independence
formed
a
league
or
alliance
with
one
another
as
united
states
this
title
antedated
the
adoption
of
the
articles
of
confederation
it
was
assumed
immediately
after
the
declaration
of
independence
and
was
continued
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
first
of
which
declared
that
the
style
of
this
confederacy
shall
be
united
states
of
america
and
this
style
was
retained
without
question
in
the
formation
of
the
present
constitution
the
name
was
not
adopted
as
antithetical
to
or
distinctive
from
confederate
as
some
seem
to
have
imagined
if
it
has
any
significance
now
it
must
have
had
the
same
under
the
articles
of
confederation
or
even
before
they
were
adopted
it
has
been
fully
shown
that
the
states
which
thus
became
and
continued
to
be
united
whatever
form
their
union
assumed
acted
and
continued
to
act
as
distinct
and
sovereign
political
communities
the
monstrous
fiction
that
they
acted
as
people
in
their
aggregate
capacity
has
not
an
atom
of
fact
to
serve
as
a
basis
to
go
back
to
the
very
beginning
the
british
colonies
never
constituted
one
people
judge
story
in
his
commentaries
on
the
constitution
seems
to
imply
the
contrary
though
he
shrinks
from
a
direct
assertion
of
it
and
clouds
the
subject
by
a
confusion
of
terms
he
says
now
it
is
apparent
that
none
of
the
colonies
before
the
revolution
were
in
the
most
large
and
general
sense
independent
or
sovereign
communities
they
were
all
originally
settled
under
and
subjected
to
the
british
crown
and
then
he
proceeds
to
show
that
they
were
in
their
colonial
condition
not
a
proposition
which
nobody
disputed
as
colonies
they
had
no
claim
and
made
no
pretension
to
sovereignty
they
were
subject
to
the
british
crown
unless
like
the
plymouth
colony
a
law
unto
themselves
but
they
were
of
each
the
only
point
which
has
any
bearing
upon
their
subsequent
relations
there
was
no
other
bond
between
them
than
that
of
their
common
allegiance
to
the
government
of
the
as
an
illustration
of
this
may
be
cited
the
historical
fact
that
when
john
stark
of
bennington
memory
was
before
the
revolution
engaged
in
a
hunting
expedition
in
the
indian
country
he
was
captured
by
the
savages
and
brought
to
albany
in
the
colony
of
new
york
for
a
ransom
but
inasmuch
as
he
belonged
to
new
hampshire
the
government
of
new
york
took
no
action
for
his
release
there
was
not
even
enough
community
of
feeling
to
induce
individual
citizens
to
provide
money
for
the
purpose
there
were
however
local
and
partial
confederacies
among
the
new
england
colonies
long
before
the
declaration
of
independence
as
early
as
the
year
a
congress
had
been
organized
of
delegates
from
massachusetts
plymouth
new
haven
and
connecticut
under
the
style
of
the
united
colonies
of
new
england
the
objects
of
this
confederacy
according
to
bancroft
were
protection
against
the
encroachments
of
the
dutch
and
french
security
against
the
tribes
of
savages
the
liberties
of
the
gospel
in
purity
and
in
peace
the
general
affairs
of
the
company
were
intrusted
to
commissions
two
from
each
colony
but
the
same
historian
tells
us
that
to
each
its
respective
local
jurisdiction
was
carefully
reserved
and
he
refers
to
this
as
evidence
that
the
of
was
even
then
in
existence
thus
remarkable
for
unmixed
simplicity
he
proceeds
was
the
form
of
the
first
confederated
government
in
america
there
was
no
president
except
as
a
moderator
of
its
meetings
and
the
larger
state
massachusetts
superior
to
all
the
rest
in
territory
wealth
and
population
had
no
greater
number
of
votes
than
new
haven
but
the
commissioners
were
in
reality
little
more
than
a
deliberative
body
they
possessed
no
executive
power
and
while
they
could
decree
a
war
and
a
levy
of
troops
it
remained
for
the
states
to
carry
their
votes
into
effect
this
confederacy
continued
in
existence
for
nearly
fifty
years
between
that
period
and
the
year
when
the
first
continental
congress
met
in
philadelphia
several
other
temporary
and
provisional
associations
of
colonies
had
been
formed
and
the
people
had
been
taught
the
advantages
of
union
for
a
common
purpose
but
they
had
never
abandoned
or
compromised
the
great
principle
of
community
independence
that
form
of
generated
in
the
german
forests
before
the
days
of
the
cæsars
had
given
to
that
rude
people
a
and
patriotism
which
first
checked
the
flight
of
the
roman
eagles
which
elsewhere
had
been
the
emblem
of
their
dominion
over
the
known
world
this
principle
the
great
preserver
of
all
communal
freedom
and
of
mutual
harmony
was
transplanted
by
the
saxons
into
england
and
there
sustained
those
personal
rights
which
after
the
fall
of
the
heptarchy
were
almost
obliterated
by
the
encroachments
of
norman
despotism
but
having
the
strength
and
perpetuity
of
truth
and
right
were
reasserted
by
the
mailed
hands
of
the
barons
at
runnymede
for
their
own
benefit
and
that
of
their
posterity
englishmen
the
early
settlers
brought
this
idea
to
the
wilds
of
america
and
it
found
expression
in
many
forms
among
the
infant
colonies
edward
everett
in
his
address
delivered
in
new
york
in
following
the
lead
of
judge
story
and
with
even
less
caution
boldly
declares
that
before
their
independence
of
england
was
asserted
they
the
colonies
constituted
provincial
to
sustain
this
position
utterly
contrary
to
all
history
as
it
is
he
is
unable
to
adduce
any
valid
american
authority
but
relies
almost
exclusively
upon
loose
expressions
employed
in
debate
in
the
british
parliament
about
the
period
of
the
american
revolution
such
as
that
people
that
loyal
and
respectable
people
this
enlightened
and
spirited
people
etc
the
speakers
who
made
use
of
this
colloquial
phraseology
concerning
the
inhabitants
of
a
distant
continent
in
the
freedom
of
extemporaneous
debate
were
not
framing
their
ideas
with
the
exactitude
of
a
didactic
treatise
and
could
little
have
foreseen
the
extraordinary
use
to
be
made
of
their
expressions
nearly
a
century
afterward
in
sustaining
a
theory
contradictory
to
history
as
well
as
to
common
sense
it
is
as
if
the
familiar
expressions
often
employed
in
our
own
time
such
as
the
people
of
africa
or
the
people
of
south
america
should
be
cited
by
some
ingenious
theorist
of
a
future
generation
as
evidence
that
the
subjects
of
the
khedive
and
those
of
the
king
of
dahomey
were
but
one
people
or
that
the
peruvians
and
the
patagonians
belonged
to
the
same
political
community
everett
it
is
true
quotes
two
expressions
of
the
continental
congress
to
sustain
his
remarkable
proposition
that
the
colonies
were
a
people
one
of
these
is
found
in
a
letter
addressed
by
the
congress
to
general
gage
in
october
remonstrating
against
the
erection
of
fortifications
in
boston
in
which
they
say
we
entreat
your
excellency
to
consider
what
a
tendency
this
conduct
must
have
to
irritate
and
force
free
hitherto
well
disposed
to
peaceable
measures
into
hostilities
from
this
expression
everett
argues
that
the
congress
considered
themselves
the
representatives
of
a
people
but
by
reference
to
the
proceedings
of
the
congress
he
might
readily
have
ascertained
that
the
letter
to
general
gage
was
written
in
behalf
of
town
of
boston
and
province
of
massachusetts
the
people
of
which
were
considered
by
all
america
as
suffering
in
the
common
cause
for
their
noble
and
spirited
opposition
to
oppressive
acts
of
parliament
the
avowed
object
was
to
entreat
his
excellency
from
the
assurance
we
have
of
the
peaceable
disposition
of
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
boston
and
of
the
province
of
massachusetts
to
discontinue
his
fortifications
these
were
the
people
referred
to
by
the
congress
and
the
children
of
the
pilgrims
who
occupied
at
that
period
the
town
of
boston
and
province
of
massachusetts
bay
would
have
been
not
a
little
astonished
to
be
reckoned
as
one
people
in
any
other
respect
than
that
of
the
common
cause
with
the
roman
catholics
of
maryland
the
episcopalians
of
virginia
the
quakers
of
pennsylvania
or
the
baptists
of
rhode
island
the
other
citation
of
everett
is
from
the
first
sentence
of
the
declaration
of
independence
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
to
dissolve
the
political
bands
which
have
connected
them
with
another
etc
this
he
says
characterizes
the
good
people
of
the
colonies
as
one
people
plainly
it
does
no
such
thing
the
misconception
is
so
palpable
as
scarcely
to
admit
of
serious
answer
the
declaration
of
independence
opens
with
a
general
proposition
one
people
is
equivalent
to
saying
people
the
use
of
the
correlatives
one
and
another
was
the
simple
and
natural
way
of
stating
this
general
proposition
one
people
applies
and
was
obviously
intended
to
apply
to
all
cases
of
the
same
category
to
that
of
new
hampshire
or
delaware
or
south
carolina
or
of
any
other
people
existing
or
to
exist
and
whether
acting
separately
or
in
concert
it
applies
to
any
case
and
all
cases
of
dissolution
of
political
bands
as
well
as
to
the
case
of
the
british
colonies
it
does
not
either
directly
or
by
implication
assert
their
unification
and
has
no
bearing
whatever
upon
the
question
when
the
colonies
united
in
sending
representatives
to
a
congress
in
philadelphia
there
was
no
purpose
no
suggestion
of
a
purpose
to
merge
their
separate
individuality
in
one
consolidated
mass
no
such
idea
existed
or
with
their
known
opinions
could
have
existed
they
did
not
assume
to
become
a
united
colony
or
province
but
styled
themselves
united
colonies
colonies
united
for
purposes
of
mutual
counsel
and
defense
as
the
new
england
colonies
had
been
united
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
it
was
as
not
as
a
state
or
united
people
that
these
colonies
still
distinct
and
politically
independent
of
each
other
asserted
and
achieved
their
independence
of
the
as
united
states
they
adopted
the
articles
of
confederation
in
which
the
separate
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
of
each
was
distinctly
asserted
they
were
united
states
when
great
britain
acknowledged
the
absolute
freedom
and
independence
of
each
distinctly
and
separately
recognized
by
name
france
and
spain
were
parties
to
the
same
treaty
and
the
french
and
spanish
idioms
still
express
and
perpetuate
more
exactly
than
the
english
the
true
idea
intended
to
be
embodied
in
the
title
états
or
estados
the
states
united
it
was
without
any
change
of
title
still
as
united
states
without
any
sacrifice
of
individuality
without
any
compromise
of
sovereignty
that
the
same
parties
entered
into
a
new
and
amended
compact
with
one
another
under
the
present
constitution
larger
and
more
varied
powers
were
conferred
upon
the
common
government
for
the
purpose
of
insuring
a
more
perfect
union
not
for
that
of
destroying
or
impairing
the
integrity
of
the
contracting
members
the
point
which
now
specially
concerns
the
argument
is
the
historical
fact
that
in
all
these
changes
of
circumstances
and
of
government
there
has
never
been
one
single
instance
of
action
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
or
as
one
body
before
the
era
of
independence
whatever
was
done
by
the
people
of
the
colonies
was
done
by
the
people
of
each
colony
separately
and
independently
of
each
other
although
in
union
by
their
delegates
for
certain
specified
purposes
since
the
assertion
of
their
independence
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
never
acted
otherwise
than
as
the
people
of
each
state
severally
and
separately
the
articles
of
confederation
were
established
and
ratified
by
the
several
states
either
through
conventions
of
their
people
or
through
the
state
legislatures
the
constitution
which
superseded
those
articles
was
framed
as
we
have
seen
by
delegates
chosen
and
empowered
by
the
several
states
and
was
ratified
by
conventions
of
the
people
of
the
same
states
all
acting
in
entire
independence
of
one
another
this
ratification
alone
gave
it
force
and
validity
without
the
approval
and
ratification
of
the
people
of
the
states
it
would
have
been
as
madison
expressed
it
of
no
more
consequence
than
the
paper
on
which
it
was
written
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
or
a
indeed
no
such
political
community
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
exists
at
this
day
or
ever
did
exist
senators
in
congress
confessedly
represent
the
states
as
equal
units
the
house
of
representatives
is
not
a
body
of
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
often
erroneously
asserted
but
the
constitution
in
the
second
section
of
its
first
article
expressly
declares
that
it
shall
be
composed
of
members
chosen
by
people
of
the
several
nor
is
it
true
that
the
president
and
are
elected
as
it
is
sometimes
vaguely
stated
by
vote
of
the
whole
people
of
the
union
their
election
is
even
more
unlike
what
such
a
vote
would
be
than
that
of
the
representatives
who
in
numbers
at
least
represent
the
strength
of
their
respective
states
in
the
election
of
president
and
the
constitution
article
ii
prescribes
that
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct
a
number
of
electors
for
the
purpose
of
choosing
a
president
and
the
number
of
these
electors
is
based
partly
upon
the
equal
sovereignty
partly
upon
the
unequal
population
of
the
respective
states
it
is
then
absolutely
true
that
there
has
never
been
any
such
thing
as
a
vote
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
no
such
people
is
recognized
by
the
constitution
and
no
such
political
community
has
ever
existed
it
is
equally
true
that
no
officer
or
department
of
the
general
government
formed
by
the
constitution
derives
authority
from
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
or
has
ever
been
chosen
by
such
majority
as
little
as
any
other
is
the
united
states
government
a
government
of
a
majority
of
the
mass

phraseology
of

has
been
generally
regarded
as
the
stronghold
of
the
advocates
of
consolidation
it
has
been
interpreted
as
meaning
that
we
the
people

as
a
collective
body
or
as
a
nation
in

capacity
had
ordained

this
interpretation
constituted
in
the
beginning
the
most
serious
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
ratification

was
probably
this
to

day
of
the
session
and
in
the
very
opening
of
the
debate
attacked
it
vehemently
he
said
speaking
of
the
system
of
government
set
forth
in
the
proposed
constitution
that
this
is
a
consolidated
government
is
demonstrably
clear
and
the
danger
of
such
a
government
is
to
my
mind
very
striking
i
have
the
highest
veneration
for
those
gentlemen
its
authors
but
sir
give
me
leave
to
demand
what
right
had
they
to
say
the
my
political
curiosity
exclusive
of
my
anxious
solicitude
for
the
public
welfare
leads
me
to
ask
who
authorized
them
to
speak
the
language
of
the
instead
of
the
states
are
the
characteristics
and
the
soul
of
a
confederation
if
the
states
be
not
the
agents
of
this
compact
it
must
be
one
great
consolidated
national
government
of
the
people
of
all
the
states
again
on
the
next
day
with
reference
to
the
same
subject
he
said
when
i
asked
that
question
i
thought
the
meaning
of
my
interrogation
was
obvious
the
fate
of
this
question
and
of
america
may
depend
on
this
have
they
said
we
the
states
have
they
made
a
proposal
of
a
compact
between
states
if
they
had
this
would
be
a
confederation
it
is
otherwise
most
clearly
a
consolidated
government
the
question
turns
sir
on
that
poor
little
thing
the
expression
the
people
instead
of
the
states
of
america
the
same
difficulty
arose
in
other
minds
and
in
other
conventions
the
scruples
of
adams
were
removed
by
the
explanations
of
others
and
by
the
assurance
of
the
adoption
of
the
amendments
thought
necessary
especially
of
that
declaratory
safeguard
afterward
embodied
in
the
tenth
amendment
to
be
referred
to
hereafter
henry
objection
was
thus
answered
by
madison
who
are
parties
to
it
the
constitution
the
people
but
the
people
as
composing
one
great
but
the
people
as
composing
were
it
as
the
gentleman
henry
asserts
a
consolidated
government
the
assent
of
a
majority
of
the
people
would
be
sufficient
for
its
establishment
and
as
a
majority
have
adopted
it
already
the
remaining
states
would
be
bound
by
the
act
of
the
majority
even
if
they
unanimously
reprobated
it
were
it
such
a
government
as
is
suggested
it
would
be
now
binding
on
the
people
of
this
state
without
having
had
the
privilege
of
deliberating
upon
it
but
sir
no
state
is
bound
by
it
as
it
is
without
its
own
consent
should
all
the
states
adopt
it
it
will
be
then
a
government
established
by
the
thirteen
states
of
america
not
through
the
intervention
of
the
legislatures
but
by
the
people
at
large
in
this
particular
respect
the
distinction
between
the
existing
and
proposed
governments
is
very
material
the
existing
system
has
been
derived
from
the
dependent
derivative
authority
of
the
legislatures
of
the
states
whereas
this
is
derived
from
the
superior
power
of
the
people
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
was
spoken
by
one
of
the
leading
members
of
the
convention
which
formed
the
constitution
within
a
few
months
after
that
instrument
was
drawn
up
madison
hearers
could
readily
appreciate
his
clear
answer
to
the
objection
made
the
people
intended
were
those
of
the
respective
states
the
only
organized
communities
of
people
exercising
sovereign
powers
of
government
and
the
idea
intended
was
the
ratification
and
establishment
of
the
constitution
by
direct
act
of
the
people
in
their
conventions
instead
of
by
act
of
their
legislatures
as
in
the
adoption
of
the
articles
of
confederation
the
explanation
seems
to
have
been
as
satisfactory
as
it
was
simple
and
intelligible
henry
although
he
fought
to
the
last
against
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
did
not
again
bring
forward
this
objection
for
the
reason
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
fully
answered
indeed
we
hear
no
more
of
the
interpretation
which
suggested
it
from
that
period
for
nearly
half
a
century
when
it
was
revived
and
has
since
been
employed
to
sustain
that
theory
of
a
great
consolidated
national
government
which
madison
so
distinctly
repudiated
but
have
access
to
sources
of
information
not
then
available
which
make
the
intent
and
meaning
of
the
constitution
still
plainer
when
henry
made
his
objection
and
madison
answered
it
the
journal
of
the
philadelphia
convention
had
not
been
published
that
body
had
sat
with
closed
doors
and
among
its
rules
had
been
the
following
that
no
copy
be
taken
of
any
entry
on
the
journal
during
the
sitting
of
the
house
without
the
leave
of
the
house
that
members
only
be
permitted
to
inspect
the
journal
that
nothing
spoken
in
the
house
be
printed
or
otherwise
published
or
communicated
without
leave
we
can
understand
by
reference
to
these
rules
how
madison
should
have
felt
precluded
from
making
allusion
to
anything
that
had
occurred
during
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
but
the
secrecy
then
covering
those
proceedings
has
long
since
been
removed
the
manuscript
journal
which
was
intrusted
to
the
keeping
of
general
washington
president
of
the
convention
was
deposited
by
him
nine
years
afterward
among
the
archives
of
the
state
department
it
has
since
been
published
and
we
can
trace
for
ourselves
the
origin
and
ascertain
the
exact
significance
of
that
expression
we
the
people
on
which
patrick
henry
thought
the
fate
of
america
might
depend
and
which
has
been
so
grossly
perverted
in
later
years
from
its
true
intent
the
original
language
of
the
preamble
reported
to
the
convention
by
a
committee
of
five
appointed
to
prepare
the
constitution
as
we
find
it
in
the
proceedings
of
august
was
as
follows
we
the
people
of
the
states
of
new
hampshire
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
providence
plantations
connecticut
new
york
new
jersey
pennsylvania
delaware
maryland
virginia
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
georgia
do
ordain
declare
and
establish
the
following
constitution
for
the
government
of
ourselves
and
our
posterity
there
can
be
no
question
here
what
was
meant
it
was
people
of
the
designated
by
name
that
were
to
ordain
declare
and
establish
the
compact
of
union
for
themselves
and
their
posterity
there
is
no
ambiguity
nor
uncertainty
in
the
language
nor
was
there
any
difference
in
the
convention
as
to
the
use
of
it
the
preamble
as
perfected
was
submitted
to
vote
on
the
next
day
and
as
the
journal
informs
us
it
passed
in
the
affirmative
there
was
no
subsequent
change
of
opinion
on
the
subject
the
reason
for
the
modification
afterward
made
in
the
language
is
obvious
it
was
found
that
unanimous
ratification
of
all
the
states
could
not
be
expected
and
it
was
determined
as
we
have
already
seen
that
the
consent
of
states
should
suffice
for
the
establishment
of
the
new
compact
between
the
states
so
ratifying
the
same
nine
would
be
sufficient
to
put
the
proposed
government
in
operation
as
to
them
thus
leaving
the
remainder
of
the
thirteen
to
pursue
such
course
as
might
be
to
each
preferable
when
this
conclusion
was
reached
it
became
manifestly
impracticable
to
designate
beforehand
the
consenting
states
by
name
hence
in
the
final
revision
the
specific
enumeration
of
the
thirteen
states
was
omitted
and
the
equivalent
phrase
people
of
the
united
states
inserted
in
its
place
plainly
meaning
the
people
of
such
states
as
should
agree
to
unite
on
the
terms
proposed
the
imposing
fabric
of
political
delusion
which
has
been
erected
on
the
basis
of
this
simple
transaction
disappears
before
the
light
of
historical
record
could
the
authors
of
the
constitution
have
foreseen
the
perversion
to
be
made
of
their
obvious
meaning
it
might
have
been
prevented
by
an
easy
periphrasis
such
as
we
the
people
of
the
states
hereby
united
or
something
to
the
same
effect
the
word
people
in
as
in
was
as
it
is
a
collective
noun
employed
indiscriminately
either
as
a
unit
in
such
expressions
as
this
people
a
free
people
or
in
a
distributive
sense
as
applied
to
the
citizens
or
inhabitants
of
one
state
or
country
or
a
number
of
states
or
countries
when
the
convention
of
the
colony
of
virginia
in
instructed
their
delegates
to
the
congress
that
was
to
meet
in
philadelphia
to
obtain
a
redress
of
those
grievances
without
which
people
of
can
neither
be
safe
free
nor
happy
it
was
certainly
not
intended
to
convey
the
idea
that
the
people
of
the
american
continent
or
even
of
the
british
colonies
in
america
constituted
one
political
community
nor
did
edmund
burke
have
any
such
meaning
when
he
said
in
his
celebrated
speech
in
parliament
in
the
people
of
the
colonies
are
descendants
of
englishmen
we
need
go
no
further
than
to
the
familiar
language
of
king
translation
of
the
bible
for
multiplied
illustrations
of
this
indiscriminate
use
of
the
term
both
in
its
collective
and
distributive
senses
for
example
king
solomon
prays
at
the
dedication
of
the
temple
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
unto
the
supplication
of
israel
to
hearken
unto
them
in
all
that
they
call
for
unto
thee
for
thou
didst
separate
them
from
among
the
of
the
earth
to
be
thine
inheritance
kings
viii
here
we
have
both
the
singular
and
plural
senses
of
the
same
word
israel
and
the
people
of
the
in
two
consecutive
sentences
in
the
people
of
the
earth
the
word
is
used
precisely
as
it
is
in
the
expression
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
and
has
exactly
the
same
force
and
effect
if
in
the
latter
case
it
implies
that
the
people
of
massachusetts
and
those
of
virginia
were
mere
fractional
parts
of
one
political
community
it
must
in
the
former
imply
a
like
unity
among
the
philistines
the
egyptians
the
assyrians
babylonians
and
persians
and
all
other
people
of
the
earth
except
the
israelites
scores
of
examples
of
the
same
sort
might
be
cited
if
it
were
necessary
in
the
declaration
of
independence
we
find
precisely
analogous
instances
of
the
employment
of
the
singular
form
for
both
singular
and
plural
senses
one
people
a
free
people
in
the
former
and
the
good
people
of
these
colonies
in
the
latter
judge
story
in
the
excess
of
his
zeal
in
behalf
of
a
theory
of
consolidation
bases
upon
this
last
expression
the
conclusion
that
the
assertion
of
independence
was
the
act
of
whole
of
the
united
colonies
as
a
unit
overlooking
or
suppressing
the
fact
that
in
the
very
same
sentence
the
colonies
declare
themselves
free
and
independent
not
a
free
and
independent
repeating
the
words
independent
states
three
times
if
however
the
declaration
of
independence
constituted
one
of
the
colonies
then
that
geographical
section
of
it
formerly
known
as
the
colony
of
maryland
was
in
a
state
of
revolt
or
rebellion
against
the
others
as
well
as
against
great
britain
from
to
during
which
period
maryland
refused
to
ratify
or
be
bound
by
the
articles
of
confederation
which
according
to
this
theory
was
binding
upon
her
as
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
had
adopted
it
north
carolina
and
rhode
island
were
in
a
state
of
rebellion
in
while
they
declined
to
ratify
and
recognize
the
constitution
adopted
by
the
other
eleven
fractions
of
this
united
people
yet
no
hint
of
any
such
pretension
of
any
claim
of
authority
over
them
by
the
majority
of
any
assertion
of
the
supremacy
of
the
union
is
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
records
of
that
period
it
might
have
been
unnecessary
to
bestow
so
much
time
and
attention
in
exposing
the
absurdity
of
the
deductions
from
a
theory
so
false
but
for
the
fact
that
it
has
been
specious
enough
to
secure
the
countenance
of
men
of
such
distinction
as
webster
story
and
everett
and
that
it
has
been
made
the
plea
to
justify
a
bloody
war
against
that
principle
of
state
sovereignty
and
independence
which
was
regarded
by
the
fathers
of
the
union
as
the
of
the
structure
and
the
basis
of
the
hope
for
its
perpetuity

those

essential
of

invariably

term

wherever
it
is
used
in

instrument
no
such

is

read
that

the
federal
character
of
the
union
is
expressed
by
this
very
phraseology
which
recognizes
the
distinct
integrity
of
its
members
not
as
fractional
parts
of
one
great
unit
but
as
component
units
of
an
association
so
clear
was
this
to
contemporaries
that
it
needed
only
to
be
pointed
out
to
satisfy
their
scruples
we
have
seen
how
effectual
was
the
answer
of
madison
to
the
objections
raised
by
patrick
henry
tench
coxe
of
pennsylvania
one
of
the
ablest
political
writers
of
his
generation
in
answering
a
similar
objection
said
if
the
federal
convention
had
meant
to
exclude
the
idea
of
that
is
of
several
and
separate
sovereignties
joining
in
a
confederacy
they
would
have
said
the
people
of
america
for
union
necessarily
involves
the
idea
of
competent
states
which
complete
consolidation
excludes
more
than
forty
years
afterward
when
the
gradual
accretions
to
the
power
and
influence
of
the
central
government
had
grown
to
such
extent
as
to
begin
to
hide
from
view
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
founded
those
very
objections
which
in
the
beginning
had
been
answered
abandoned
and
thrown
aside
were
brought
to
light
again
and
presented
to
the
country
as
expositions
of
the
true
meaning
of
the
constitution
webster
one
of
the
first
to
revive
some
of
those
early
misconceptions
so
long
ago
refuted
as
to
be
almost
forgotten
and
to
breathe
into
them
such
renewed
vitality
as
his
commanding
genius
could
impart
in
the
course
of
his
debate
in
the
senate
with
hayne
in
said
it
can
not
be
shown
that
the
constitution
is
a
compact
between
state
governments
the
constitution
itself
in
its
very
front
refutes
that
proposition
it
declares
that
it
is
ordained
and
established
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
so
far
from
saying
that
it
is
established
by
the
governments
of
the
several
states
it
does
not
even
say
that
it
is
established
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
but
it
pronounces
that
it
is
established
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
judge
story
about
the
same
time
began
to
advance
the
same
theory
but
more
guardedly
and
with
less
rashness
of
statement
it
was
not
until
thirty
years
after
that
it
attained
its
full
development
in
the
annunciations
of
sectionists
rather
than
statesmen
two
such
may
suffice
as
specimens
edward
everett
in
his
address
delivered
on
the
of
july
and
already
referred
to
says
of
the
constitution
that
instrument
does
not
purport
to
be
a
but
a
constitution
of
government
it
appears
in
its
first
sentence
not
to
have
been
entered
into
by
the
states
but
to
have
been
ordained
and
established
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
for
themselves
and
their
the
states
are
not
named
in
it
nearly
all
the
characteristic
powers
of
sovereignty
are
expressly
granted
to
the
general
government
and
expressly
prohibited
to
the
states
everett
afterward
repeats
the
assertion
that
the
states
are
not
named
in
it
but
a
yet
more
extraordinary
statement
of
the
one
people
theory
is
found
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
london
times
in
the
same
year
on
the
causes
of
the
civil
war
by
john
lothrop
motley
afterward
minister
to
the
court
of
james
in
this
letter
motley
says
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
was
not
a
compact
who
ever
heard
of
a
compact
to
which
there
were
no
parties
or
who
ever
heard
of
a
compact
made
by
a
single
party
with
himself
yet
the
name
of
no
state
is
mentioned
in
the
whole
document
the
states
themselves
are
only
mentioned
to
receive
commands
or
prohibitions
and
the
of
the
united
states
is
the
single
party
by
whom
alone
the
instrument
is
executed
the
constitution
was
not
drawn
up
by
the
states
it
was
not
promulgated
in
the
name
of
the
states
it
was
not
ratified
by
the
states
the
states
never
acceded
to
it
and
possess
no
power
to
secede
from
it
it
was
and
established
over
the
states
by
a
power
superior
to
the
states
by
the
people
of
the
whole
land
in
their
aggregate
capacity
etc
it
would
be
very
hard
to
condense
a
more
amazing
amount
of
audacious
and
reckless
falsehood
in
the
same
space
in
all
motley
array
of
bold
assertions
there
is
not
one
single
truth
unless
it
be
perhaps
that
the
constitution
was
not
drawn
up
by
the
states
yet
it
was
drawn
up
by
their
delegates
and
it
is
of
such
material
as
this
derived
from
writers
whose
reputation
gives
a
semblance
of
authenticity
to
their
statements
that
history
is
constructed
and
transmitted
one
of
the
most
remarkable
though
perhaps
the
least
important
of
these
misstatements
is
that
which
is
also
twice
repeated
by
everett
that
the
name
of
no
state
is
mentioned
in
the
whole
document
or
as
he
puts
it
the
states
are
not
named
in
it
very
little
careful
examination
would
have
sufficed
to
find
in
the
second
section
of
the
very
first
article
of
the
constitution
the
names
of
every
one
of
the
thirteen
then
existent
states
distinctly
mentioned
with
the
number
of
representatives
to
which
each
would
be
entitled
in
case
of
acceding
to
the
constitution
until
a
census
of
their
population
could
be
taken
the
mention
there
made
of
the
states
by
name
is
of
no
special
significance
it
has
no
bearing
upon
any
question
of
principle
and
the
denial
of
it
is
a
purely
gratuitous
illustration
of
the
recklessness
of
those
from
whom
it
proceeds
and
the
low
estimate
put
on
the
intelligence
of
those
addressed
it
serves
however
to
show
how
much
credence
is
to
be
given
to
their
authority
as
interpreters
and
expounders
the
reason
why
the
names
of
the
ratifying
states
were
not
mentioned
has
already
been
given
it
was
simply
because
it
was
not
known
which
states
would
ratify
but
as
regards
mention
of
the
several
states
each
state
any
state
particular
states
and
the
like
the
constitution
is
full
of
it
i
am
informed
by
one
who
has
taken
the
pains
to
examine
carefully
that
document
with
reference
to
this
very
point
that
without
including
any
mention
of
the
united
states
or
of
foreign
states
and
excluding
also
the
amendments
the
constitution
in
its
original
draft
makes
mention
of
the
states
states
no
less
than
times
and
of
these
seventy
times
only
times
in
the
way
of
prohibition
of
the
exercise
of
a
power
in
fact
it
is
full
of
statehood
leave
out
all
mention
of
the
states
i
make
no
mere
verbal
point
or
quibble
but
mean
the
states
in
their
separate
several
distinct
capacity
and
what
would
remain
would
be
of
less
account
than
the
play
of
the
prince
of
denmark
with
the
part
of
omitted
but
leaving
out
of
consideration
for
the
moment
all
minor
questions
the
vital
and
essential
point
of
inquiry
now
is
by
what
authority
the
constitution
was
ordained
and
established
webster
says
it
was
done
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
everett
repeats
substantially
the
same
thing
and
motley
taking
a
step
further
says
that
it
was
and
established
by
a
superior
to
the
by
the
people
of
the
whole
land
in
their
aggregate
capacity
the
advocates
of
this
mischievous
dogma
assume
the
existence
of
an
unauthorized
undefined
power
of
a
whole
people
or
people
of
the
whole
land
operating
through
the
agency
of
the
philadelphia
convention
to
impose
its
decrees
upon
the
states
they
forget
in
the
first
place
that
this
convention
was
composed
of
delegates
not
of
any
one
people
but
of
distinct
states
and
in
the
second
place
that
their
action
had
no
force
or
validity
whatever
in
the
words
of
madison
that
it
was
of
no
more
consequence
than
the
paper
on
which
it
was
written
until
approved
and
ratified
by
a
sufficient
number
of
states
the
meaning
of
the
preamble
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
is
ascertained
fixed
and
defined
by
the
final
article
the
ratification
of
the
conventions
of
shall
be
sufficient
for
the
of
this
constitution
between
states
so
the
same
if
it
was
already
established
what
need
was
there
of
further
establishment
it
was
not
ordained
or
established
at
all
until
ratified
by
the
requisite
number
of
states
the
announcement
in
the
preamble
of
course
had
reference
to
that
expected
ratification
without
which
the
preamble
would
have
been
as
void
as
the
body
of
the
instrument
the
assertion
that
it
was
not
ratified
by
the
states
is
so
plainly
and
positively
contrary
to
fact
so
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
constitution
itself
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
was
intended
by
it
unless
it
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
presumed
ignorance
of
the
subject
among
the
readers
of
an
english
journal
to
impose
upon
them
a
preposterous
fiction
it
was
state
ratification
alone
the
ratification
of
the
of
each
state
independently
of
all
other
people
that
gave
force
vitality
and
validity
to
the
constitution
judge
story
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
voters
assembled
in
the
several
states
asks
where
else
they
could
have
assembled
a
pertinent
question
on
our
theory
but
the
idea
he
evidently
intended
to
convey
was
that
the
voting
of
the
people
by
states
was
a
mere
matter
of
geographical
necessity
or
local
convenience
just
as
the
people
of
a
state
vote
by
counties
the
people
of
a
county
by
towns
beats
or
precincts
and
the
people
of
a
city
by
wards
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
in
all
organized
republican
communities
majorities
govern
when
we
speak
of
the
will
of
the
people
of
a
community
we
mean
the
will
of
a
majority
which
when
constitutionally
expressed
is
binding
on
any
minority
of
the
same
community
if
then
we
can
conceive
and
admit
for
a
moment
the
possibility
that
when
the
constitution
was
under
consideration
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
politically
one
people
a
collective
unit
two
deductions
are
clearly
inevitable
in
the
first
place
each
geographical
division
of
this
great
community
would
have
been
entitled
to
vote
according
to
its
relative
population
and
in
the
second
the
expressed
will
of
the
legal
majority
would
have
been
binding
upon
the
whole
a
denial
of
the
first
proposition
would
be
a
denial
of
common
justice
and
equal
rights
a
denial
of
the
second
would
be
to
destroy
all
government
and
establish
mere
anarchy
now
of
these
principles
was
practiced
or
proposed
or
even
imagined
in
the
case
of
the
action
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
if
they
were
one
political
community
upon
the
proposed
constitution
on
the
contrary
seventy
thousand
people
in
the
state
of
delaware
had
precisely
the
same
weight
one
vote
in
its
ratification
as
seven
hundred
thousand
and
more
in
virginia
or
four
hundred
thousand
in
pennsylvania
would
not
this
have
been
an
intolerable
grievance
and
wrong
would
no
protest
have
been
uttered
against
it
if
these
had
been
fractional
parts
of
one
community
of
people
again
while
the
will
of
the
consenting
majority
any
state
was
binding
on
the
opposing
minority
in
the
same
no
majority
or
majorities
of
states
or
people
had
any
control
whatever
upon
the
people
of
state
the
constitution
was
established
not
the
states
as
asserted
by
motley
but
the
states
and
only
between
states
so
the
same
little
rhode
island
with
her
seventy
thousand
inhabitants
was
not
a
mere
fractional
part
of
the
people
of
the
whole
land
during
the
period
for
which
she
held
aloof
but
was
as
free
independent
and
unmolested
as
any
other
sovereign
power
notwithstanding
the
majority
of
more
than
three
millions
of
the
whole
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
before
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
when
there
was
some
excuse
for
an
imperfect
understanding
or
misconception
of
the
terms
proposed
madison
thus
answered
in
advance
the
objections
made
on
the
ground
of
this
misconception
and
demonstrated
its
fallacy
he
wrote
that
it
will
be
a
federal
and
not
a
national
act
as
these
terms
are
understood
by
objectors
the
act
of
the
people
as
forming
so
many
independent
states
not
as
forming
one
aggregate
nation
is
obvious
from
this
single
consideration
that
it
is
to
result
neither
from
the
decision
of
a
of
the
people
of
the
union
nor
from
that
of
a
of
it
must
result
from
the
assent
of
the
several
that
are
parties
to
differing
no
otherwise
from
their
ordinary
assent
than
in
its
being
expressed
not
by
the
legislative
authority
but
by
that
of
the
people
themselves
were
the
people
regarded
in
this
transaction
as
forming
one
nation
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
would
bind
the
minority
in
the
same
manner
as
the
majority
in
each
state
must
bind
the
minority
and
the
will
of
the
majority
must
be
determined
either
by
a
comparison
of
the
individual
votes
or
by
considering
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
states
as
evidence
of
the
will
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
neither
of
these
has
been
adopted
each
state
in
ratifying
the
constitution
is
considered
as
a
sovereign
body
independent
of
all
others
and
only
to
be
bound
by
its
own
voluntary
act
it
is
a
tedious
task
to
have
to
expose
the
misstatements
both
of
fact
and
of
principle
which
have
occupied
so
much
attention
but
it
is
rendered
necessary
by
the
extent
to
which
they
have
been
imposed
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
public
through
reckless
assertion
and
confident
and
incessant
repetition
remember
says
webster
have
heard
marshall
ask
counsel
who
was
insisting
upon
the
authority
of
an
act
of
legislation
he
thought
an
act
of
legislation
could
create
or
destroy
a
fact
or
change
the
truth
of
would
it
alter
the
fact
said
he
if
a
legislature
should
solemnly
enact
that
hume
never
wrote
the
history
of
england
a
legislature
may
alter
the
law
continues
webster
no
power
can
reverse
a
fact
hence
if
the
convention
of
had
expressly
declared
that
the
constitution
was
to
be
ordained
by
people
of
the
united
states
the
or
by
the
people
of
america
as
one
nation
this
would
not
have
destroyed
the
fact
that
it
was
ratified
by
each
state
for
itself
and
that
each
state
was
bound
only
by
own
voluntary
act
bledsoe
but
the
convention
as
we
have
seen
said
no
such
thing
no
such
community
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
is
known
to
it
or
ever
acted
on
it
it
was
ordained
established
and
ratified
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
and
no
theories
or
assertions
of
a
later
generation
can
change
or
conceal
this
fixed
fact
as
it
stands
revealed
in
the
light
of
contemporaneous
records

the

the

a

and
the
states
acceded
to
evidence
of
the
constitution
itself
and
of
contemporary
records
i
have
habitually
spoken
of
the
federal
constitution
as
a
compact
and
of
the
parties
to
it
as
sovereign
states
these
terms
should
not
and
in
earlier
times
would
not
have
required
explanation
or
vindication
but
they
have
been
called
in
question
by
the
modern
school
of
consolidation
these
gentlemen
admit
that
the
government
under
the
articles
of
confederation
was
a
compact
webster
in
his
rejoinder
to
hayne
on
the
of
january
said
when
the
gentleman
says
the
constitution
is
a
compact
between
the
states
he
uses
language
exactly
applicable
to
the
old
confederation
he
speaks
as
if
he
were
in
congress
before
he
describes
fully
that
old
state
of
things
then
existing
the
confederation
was
in
strictness
a
compact
the
states
as
states
were
parties
to
it
we
had
no
other
general
government
but
that
was
found
insufficient
and
inadequate
to
the
public
exigencies
the
people
were
not
satisfied
with
it
and
undertook
to
establish
a
better
they
undertook
to
form
a
general
government
which
should
stand
on
a
new
basis
not
a
confederacy
not
a
league
not
a
compact
between
states
but
a
constitution
again
in
his
discussion
with
calhoun
three
years
afterward
he
vehemently
reiterates
the
same
denial
of
the
constitution
he
says
does
it
call
itself
a
compact
certainly
not
it
uses
the
word
but
once
and
that
when
it
declares
that
the
states
shall
enter
into
no
compact
does
it
call
itself
a
league
a
confederacy
a
subsisting
treaty
between
the
states
certainly
not
there
is
not
a
particle
of
such
language
in
all
its
pages
the
artist
who
wrote
under
his
picture
the
legend
this
is
a
horse
made
effectual
provision
against
any
such
cavil
as
that
preferred
by
webster
and
his
followers
that
the
constitution
is
not
a
compact
because
it
is
not
so
nominated
in
the
bond
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
there
is
no
passage
in
the
iliad
or
the
æneid
in
which
either
of
those
great
works
calls
itself
or
is
called
by
its
author
an
epic
poem
yet
this
would
scarcely
be
accepted
as
evidence
that
they
are
not
epic
poems
in
an
examination
of
webster
remarks
i
do
not
find
that
he
announces
them
to
be
either
a
speech
or
an
argument
yet
their
claim
to
both
these
titles
will
hardly
be
disputed
notwithstanding
the
verbal
criticism
on
the
constitution
just
quoted
the
distinction
attempted
to
be
drawn
between
the
language
proper
to
a
confederation
and
that
belonging
to
a
constitution
as
indicating
two
different
ideas
will
not
bear
the
test
of
examination
and
application
to
the
case
of
the
united
states
it
has
been
fully
shown
in
previous
chapters
that
the
terms
union
federal
union
federal
constitution
constitution
of
the
federal
government
and
the
like
were
used
not
merely
in
colloquial
informal
speech
but
in
public
proceedings
and
official
documents
with
reference
to
the
articles
of
confederation
as
freely
as
they
have
since
been
employed
under
the
present
constitution
the
former
union
was
as
webster
expressly
admits
as
nobody
denies
a
compact
between
states
yet
it
nowhere
calls
itself
a
compact
the
word
does
not
occur
in
it
even
the
one
time
that
it
occurs
in
the
present
constitution
although
the
contracting
states
are
in
both
prohibited
from
entering
into
any
treaty
confederation
or
alliance
with
one
another
or
with
any
foreign
power
without
the
consent
of
congress
and
the
contracting
or
constituent
parties
are
termed
united
states
in
the
one
just
as
in
the
other
webster
is
particularly
unfortunate
in
his
criticisms
upon
what
he
terms
the
new
vocabulary
in
which
the
constitution
is
styled
a
compact
and
the
states
which
ratified
it
are
spoken
of
as
having
acceded
to
it
in
the
same
speech
last
quoted
he
says
this
word
not
found
either
in
the
constitution
itself
or
in
the
ratification
of
it
by
any
one
of
the
states
has
been
chosen
for
use
here
doubtless
not
without
a
purpose
the
natural
converse
of
accession
is
secession
and
therefore
when
it
is
stated
that
the
people
of
the
states
acceded
to
the
union
it
may
be
more
plausibly
argued
that
they
may
secede
from
it
if
in
adopting
the
constitution
nothing
was
done
but
acceding
to
a
compact
nothing
would
seem
necessary
in
order
to
break
it
up
but
to
secede
from
the
same
compact
but
the
term
is
wholly
out
of
place
accession
as
a
word
applied
to
political
associations
implies
coming
into
a
league
treaty
or
confederacy
by
one
hitherto
a
stranger
to
it
and
secession
implies
departing
from
such
league
or
confederacy
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
used
no
such
form
of
expression
in
establishing
the
present
government
repeating
and
reiterating
in
many
forms
what
is
substantially
the
same
idea
and
attributing
the
use
of
the
terms
which
he
attacks
to
an
ulterior
purpose
webster
says
this
is
the
reason
sir
which
makes
it
necessary
to
abandon
the
use
of
constitutional
language
for
a
new
vocabulary
and
to
substitute
in
the
place
of
plain
historical
facts
a
series
of
assumptions
this
is
the
reason
why
it
is
necessary
to
give
new
names
to
things
to
speak
of
the
constitution
not
as
a
constitution
but
as
a
compact
and
of
the
ratifications
by
the
people
not
as
ratifications
but
as
acts
of
accession
in
these
and
similar
passages
webster
virtually
concedes
that
if
the
constitution
a
compact
if
the
union
a
confederacy
if
the
states
as
states
severally
acceded
to
it
all
which
propositions
he
denies
then
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
their
right
to
secede
from
the
union
would
be
deducible
now
it
happens
that
these
very
terms
compact
confederacy
accede
and
the
like
were
the
terms
in
familiar
use
by
the
authors
of
the
constitution
and
their
associates
with
reference
to
that
instrument
and
its
ratification
other
writers
who
have
examined
the
subject
since
the
late
war
gave
it
an
interest
which
it
had
never
commanded
before
have
collected
such
an
array
of
evidence
in
this
behalf
that
it
is
necessary
only
to
cite
a
few
examples
the
following
language
of
gerry
of
massachusetts
in
the
convention
of
has
already
been
referred
to
if
nine
out
of
thirteen
states
can
dissolve

able
to

gouverneur
morris
one
of
the
most
pronounced
advocates
of
a
strong
central
government
in
the
convention
said
he
came
here
to
form
for
the
good
of
americans
he
was
ready
to
do
so
with
all
the
states
he
hoped
and
believed
they
all
would
enter
into
such
a
if
they
would
not
he
would
be
ready
to
join
with
any
states
that
would
but
as
the
was
to
be
voluntary
it
is
in

for
the

to
insist
on
what

that
in

protesting
against
the
proposed
violation
of
the
principles
of
the
perpetual
union
already
formed
under

articles
of

he
made
use
of
such
language
as
this
will
you
tell
us
we
ought
to
trust
you
because
you
now
enter
into
a
solemn
with
us
this
you
have
done
before
and
now
treat
with
the
utmost
contempt
will
you
now
make
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
being
and
call
on
him
to
guarantee
your
observance
of
this
the
same
you
have
formerly
done
for
your
observance
of
the
articles
of
confederation
which
you
are
now
violating
in
the
most
wanton
manner
it
is
needless
to
multiply
the
proofs
that
abound
in
the
writings
of
the
fathers
to
show
that
webster
new
vocabulary
was
the
very
language
they
familiarly
used
let
two
more
examples
suffice

authority
higher
than
that

individual
speaker
or
writer
however
eminent

second
only

at

inferior
to
that
of
the
text
of
the

itself
that
is
from
the
acts

ordinances
of

by
the
states
they
certainly
ought
to
have
been
conclusive
and
should
not
have
been
unknown

reported
to

by

of

from

resolution
of

court

said
commonwealth
passed
the
day
of
october
last
past
and
acknowledging
with
grateful
hearts
the
goodness
of
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
in
affording
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
course
of
his
providence
an
opportunity
deliberately
and
peaceably
without
fraud
or
surprise
of
entering
into
an
explicit
and
solemn
compact
with
each
other
by
assenting
to
and
ratifying
a
new
constitution
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of

to
themselves
and
their
posterity
do
in
the
name
and
in
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
assent
to
and
ratify
the
said
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
the
ratification
of
new
hampshire
is
expressed
in
precisely
the
same
words
save
only
the
difference
of
date
of
the
resolution
of
the
legislature
or
general
court
referred
to
and
also
the
use
of
the
word
state
instead
of
commonwealth
both
distinctly
accept
it
as
a
of
the
states
with
each
other
which
webster
a
son
of
new
hampshire
and
a
senator
from
massachusetts
declared
it
was
not
and
not
only
so
but
he
repudiated
the
very
vocabulary
from
which
the
words
expressing
the
doctrine
were
taken
it
would
not
need
however
this
abounding
wealth
of
contemporaneous
exposition
it
does
not
require
the
employment
of
any
particular
words
in
the
constitution
to
prove
that
it
was
drawn
up
as
a
compact
between
sovereign
states
entering
into
a
confederacy
with
each
other
and
that
they
ratified
and
acceded
to
it
separately
severally
and
independently
the
very
structure
of
the
whole
instrument
and
the
facts
attending
its
preparation
and
ratification
would
suffice
the
language
of
the
final
article
would
have
been
quite
enough
the
ratification
of
the
conventions
of
nine
states
shall
be
sufficient
for
the
establishment
of
this
constitution
between
the
states
so
ratifying
the
same
this
is
not
the
language
of
a
superior
imposing
a
mandate
upon
subordinates
the
consent
of
the
contracting
parties
is
necessary
to
its
validity
and
then
it
becomes
not
the
acceptance
and
recognition
of
an
authority
them
as
motley
represents
but
of
a
compact
them
the
simple
word
between
is
incompatible
with
any
other
idea
than
that
of
a
compact
by
independent
parties
if
it
were
possible
that
any
doubt
could
still
exist
there
is
one
provision
in
the
constitution
which
stamps
its
character
as
a
compact
too
plainly
for
cavil
or
question
the
constitution
which
had
already
provided
for
the
representation
of
the
states
in
both
houses
of
congress
thereby
bringing
the
matter
of
representation
within
the
power
of
amendment
in
its
fifth
article
contains
a
stipulation
that
no
state
without
its
own
consent
shall
be
deprived
of
its
equal
suffrage
in
the
senate
if
this
is
not
a
compact
between
the
states
the
smaller
states
have
no
guarantee
for
the
preservation
of
their
equality
of
representation
in

senate
if
the
obligation
of
a
contract
does
not

and
may
be
swept
away
at
the
will
of
three
fourths

it

that

contributed
not
a

to
the
increase
of
this

and
the
spread
of

mischievous

there
is
no
good
reason
whatever
why
it
should
be
used
in
different
senses
or
why
there
should
be
any
confusion
of
ideas
as
to
its
meaning
of
all
the
terms
employed
in
political
science
it
is
one
of
the
most
definite
and
intelligible
the
definition
of
it
given
by
that
accurate
and
lucid
publicist
burlamaqui
is
simple
and
satisfactory
that
sovereignty
is
a
right
of
commanding
in
the
last
resort
in
civil
society
the
original
seat
of
this
sovereignty
he
also
declares
to
be
in
the
people
but
he
adds
when
once
the
people
have
transferred
their
right
to
a
sovereign
a
monarch
they
can
not
without
contradiction
be
supposed
to
continue
still
masters
of
it
this
is
in
strict
accord
with
the
theory
of
american
republicanism
the
peculiarity
of
which
is
that
the
people
transfer
their
right
of
sovereignty
either
in
whole
or
in
part
they
only
delegate
to
their
governments
the
exercise
of
such
of
its
functions
as
may
be
necessary
subject
always
to
their
own
control
and
to
reassumption
whenever
such
government
fails
to
fulfill
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
instituted
i
think
it
has
already
been
demonstrated
that
in
this
country
the
only
political
community
the
only
independent
corporate
unit
through
which
the
people
can
exercise
their
sovereignty
is
the
state
minor
communities
as
those
of
counties
cities
and
towns
are
merely
fractional
subdivisions
of
the
state
and
these
do
not
affect
the
evidence
that
there
was
not
such
a
political
community
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
that
the
states
were
severally
sovereign
and
independent
when
they
were
united
under
the
articles
of
confederation
is
distinctly
asserted
in
those
articles
and
is
admitted
even
by
the
extreme
partisans
of
consolidation
of
right
they
are
still
sovereign
unless
they
have
surrendered
or
been
divested
of
their
sovereignty
and
those
who
deny
the
proposition
have
been
vainly
called
upon
to
point
out
the
process
by
which
they
have
divested
themselves
or
have
been
divested
of
it
otherwise
than
by
usurpation
since
webster
spoke
and
story
wrote
upon
the
subject
however
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
has
been
vehemently
denied
or
explained
away
as
only
a
partial
imperfect
mutilated
sovereignty
paradoxical
theories
of
divided
sovereignty
and
delegated
sovereignty
have
arisen
to
create
that
confusion
of
ideas
and
engender
those
mischievous
and
unfounded
conclusions
of
which
judge
story
speaks
confounding
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
with
the
delegated
powers
conferred
by
them
upon
their
we
hear
of
a
government
of
the
united
states
sovereign
within
its
sphere
and
of
state
governments
sovereign
in
sphere
of
the
surrender
by
the
states
of
of
their
sovereignty
to
the
united
states
and
the
like
now
if
there
be
any
one
great
principle
pervading
the
federal
constitution
the
state
constitutions
the
writings
of
the
fathers
the
whole
american
system
as
clearly
as
the
sunlight
pervades
the
solar
system
it
is
that
government
is
sovereign
that
all
governments
derive
their
powers
from
the
people
and
exercise
them
in
subjection
to
the
will
of
the
people
not
a
will
expressed
in
any
irregular
lawless
tumultuary
manner
but
the
will
of
the
organized
political
community
expressed
through
authorized
and
legitimate
channels
the
founders
of
the
american
republics
never
conferred
nor
intended
to
confer
sovereignty
upon
either
their
state
or
federal
governments
if
then
the
people
of
the
states
in
forming
a
federal
union
surrendered
or
to
use

term
transferred
or
if
they
meant
to
surrender
or
transfer
of
their
sovereignty
to
whom
was
the
transfer
made
not
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
for
there
was
no
such
people
in
existence
and
they
did
not
create
or
constitute
such
a
people
by
merger
of
themselves
not
to
the
federal
government
for
they
disclaimed
as
a
fundamental
principle
the
sovereignty
of
any
government
there
was
no
such
surrender
no
such
transfer
in
whole
or
in
part
expressed
or
implied
they
retained
and
intended
to
retain
their
sovereignty
in
its
integrity
undivided
and
indivisible
but
indeed
says
motley
the
words
and
are
purely
inapplicable
to
the
american
system
in
the
declaration
of
independence
the
provinces
declare
themselves
and
independent
states
but
the
men
of
those
days
knew
that
the
word
was
a
term
of
feudal
origin
when
their
connection
with
a
feudal
monarchy
was
abruptly
severed
the
word
had
no
meaning
for
us
if
this
be
true
the
men
of
those
days
had
a
very
extraordinary
way
of
expressing
their
conviction
that
the
word
had
no
meaning
for
us
we
have
seen
that
in
the
very
front
of
their
articles
of

they
set
forth
the
conspicuous
declaration
that
each
state
retained
its
freedom
and
independence

the

require
that
in
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
the
states
should
be
regarded
as
distinct

independent
sovereigns
they
so
regarded
by

another
contemporary
authority

of

attributes
of

now
enjoyed
by

paragraph

uses
these
terms

the

was
instituted
by
a
number
of
oliver
ellsworth
of
the
same
state
spoke
of
the
states
as
sovereign
bodies
these
were
all
eminent
members
of
the
convention
which
formed
the
constitution
there
was
scarcely
a
statesman
of
that
period
who
did
not
leave
on
record
expressions
of
the
same
sort
but
why
multiply
citations
it
is
very
evident
that
the
men
of
those
days
entertained
very
different
views
of
sovereignty
from
those
set
forth
by
the
new
lights
of
our
day
far
from
considering
it
a
term
of
feudal
origin
purely
inapplicable
to
the
american
system
they
seem
to
have
regarded
it
as
a
very
vital
principle
in
that
system
and
of
necessity
belonging
to
the
several
states
and
i
do
not
find
a
single
instance
in
which
they
applied
it
to
any
political
organization
except
the
states
their
ideas
were
in
entire
accord
with
those
of
vattel
who
in
his
chapter
of
nations
or
sovereign
states
writes
every
that
governs
itself
under
what
form
soever
without
any
dependence
on
foreign
power
is
a
in
another
part
of
the
same
chapter
he
gives
a
lucid
statement
of
the
nature
of
a
confederate
republic
such
as
ours
was
designed
to
be
he
says
several
sovereign
and
independent
states
may
unite
themselves
together
by
a
perpetual
confederacy
without
each
in
particular
ceasing
to
be
perfect
they
will
form
together
a
federal
republic
the
deliberations
in
common
will
offer
no
violence
to
sovereignty
of
each
though
they
may
in
certain
respects
put
some
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
it
in
virtue
of
voluntary
engagements
a
person
does
not
cease
to
be
free
and
independent
when
he
is
obliged
to
fulfill
the
engagements
into
which
he
has
very
willingly
entered
what
this
celebrated
author
means
here
by
a
person
is
explained
by
a
subsequent
passage
the
law
of

it
was
to

confusion

from

of

expressed

rhode
island
gave
in
her
assent
to
the
constitution
in
full
confidence
that
certain
proposed
amendments
would
be
adopted
the
first
of
which
was
expressed
in
these
words
that
congress
shall
guarantee
each
its
sovereignty
and
and
every
power
jurisdiction
and
right
which
is
not
by

expressly
delegated

this
was
in
may
when
nearly
three
years
had
been
given
to
discussion
and
explanation
of
the
new
government
by
its
founders
and
others
when
it
had
been
in
actual
operation
for
more
than
a
year
and
when
there
was
every
advantage
for
a
clear
understanding
of
its
nature
and
principles
under
such
circumstances
and
in
the
full
confidence
that
this
language
expressed
its
meaning
and
intent
the
people
of
rhode
island
signified
their
accession
to
the
confederate
republic
of
the
states
already
united
no
objection
was
made
from
any
quarter
to
the
principle
asserted
in
these
various
forms
or
to
the
amendment
in
which
it
was
finally
expressed
although
many
thought
it
unnecessary
as
being
merely
declaratory
of
what
would
have
been
sufficiently
obvious
without
it
that
the
functions
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
were
strictly
limited
to
the
exercise
of
such
powers
as
were
expressly
delegated
and
that
the
people
of
the
several
states
retained
all
others
is
it
compatible
with
reason
to
suppose
that
people
so
chary
of
the
delegation
of
specific
powers
or
functions
could
have
meant
to
surrender
or
transfer
the
very
basis
and
origin
of
all
power
their
inherent
sovereignty

this
not
by
express
grant
but
by
implication

whether
consciously
or
not
in
the
line
of

to

term
compact
takes
exception
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
on
the
ground
that
the
does
not
occur
in
the
constitution
he
admits
that
the
states
were
sovereign
under
the
articles
of
confederation
how
could
they
relinquish
or
be
deprived
of
their
sovereignty
without
even
a
mention
of
it
when
the
tenth
amendment
confronts
us
with
the
declaration
that
was
surrendered
by
implication
that
everything
was
reserved
unless
expressly
delegated
to
the
united
states
or
prohibited
to
the
states
here
is
an
attribute
which
they
certainly
possessed
which
nobody
denies
or
can
deny
that
they
possess
and
of
which
everett
says
no
mention
is
made
in
the
constitution
in
what
conceivable
way
then
was
it
lost
or
alienated
much
has
been
said
of
the
prohibition
of
the
exercise
by
the
states
of
certain
functions
of
sovereignty
such
as
making
treaties
declaring
war
coining
money
etc
this
is
only
a
part
of
the
general
compact
by
which
the
contracting
parties
covenant
one
with
another
to
abstain
from
the
separate
exercise
of
certain
powers
which
they
agree
to
intrust
to
the
management
and
control
of
the
union
or
general
agency
of
the
parties
associated
it
is
not
a
prohibition
imposed
upon
them
from
without
or
from
above
by
any
external
or
superior
power
but
is
by
their
free
consent
the
case
is
strictly
analogous
to
that
of
individuals
forming
a
mercantile
or
manufacturing
copartnership
who
voluntarily
agree
to
refrain
as
individuals
from
engaging
in
other
pursuits
or
speculations
from
lending
their
individual
credit
or
from
the
exercise
of
any
other
right
of
a
citizen
which
they
may
think
proper
to
subject
to
the
consent
or
intrust
to
the
management
of
the
firm
the
prohibitory
clauses
of
the
constitution
referred
to
are
not
at
all
a
denial
of
the
full
sovereignty
of
the
states
but
are
merely
an
agreement
among
them
to
exercise
certain
powers
of
sovereignty
in
concert
and
not
separately
and
apart
there
is
one
other
provision
of
the
constitution
which
is
generally
adduced
by
the
friends
of
centralism
as
antagonistic
to
state
sovereignty
this
is
found
in
the
second
clause
of
the
sixth
article
as
follows
this
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
shall
be
made
in
pursuance
thereof
and
all
treaties
made
or
which
shall
be
made
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
this
enunciation
of
a
principle
which
even
if
it
had
not
been
expressly
declared
would
have
been
a
necessary
deduction
from
the
acceptance
of
the
constitution
itself
has
been
magnified
and
perverted
into
a
meaning
and
purpose
entirely
foreign
to
that
which
plain
interpretation
is
sufficient
to
discern
motley
thus
dilates
on
the
subject
could
language
be
more
imperial
could
the
claim
to
state
be
more
completely
disposed
of
at
a
word
how
can
that
be
sovereign
acknowledging
no
superior
supreme
which
has
voluntarily
accepted
a
supreme
law
from
something
which
it
acknowledges
as
superior
the
mistake
which
motley
like
other
writers
of
the
same
school
makes
is
one
which
is
disposed
of
by
a
very
simple
correction
the
states
which
ordained
and
established
the
constitution
nothing
besides
what
they
themselves
they
acknowledged
no
superior
the
supremacy
was
both
in
degree
and
extent
only
that
which
was
delegated
by
the
states
to
their
common
agent
there
are
some
other
considerations
which
may
conduce
to
a
clearer
understanding
of
this
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
made
in
pursuance
thereof
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
remembered
that
when
the
federal
constitution
was
formed
each
then
existing
state
already
had
its
own
constitution
and
code
of
statute
laws
it
was
no
doubt
primarily
with
reference
to
these
that
the
provision
was
inserted
and
not
in
the
expectation
of
future
conflicts
or
discrepancies
it
is
in
this
light
alone
that
madison
considers
it
in
explaining
and
vindicating
it
in
the
federalist
again
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
supremacy
accorded
to
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states
is
expressly
limited
to
those
enacted
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
or
to
use
the
exact
language
made
in
pursuance
thereof
hamilton
in
another
chapter
of
the
federalist
calls
particular
attention
to
this
saying
and
the
italics
are
all
his
own
that
the
laws
of
the
confederacy
as
to
the
and
objects
of
its
jurisdiction
will
become
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
that
the
state
functionaries
will
coöperate
in
their
observance
and
enforcement
with
the
general
government
far
as
its
just
and
constitutional
authority
in
the
third
place
it
is
not
the
of
the
united
states
that
is
declared
to
be
supreme
but
the
and
the
laws
and
treaties
made
in
accordance
with
it
the
proposition
was
made
in
the
convention
to
organize
a
government
consisting
of
supreme
legislative
executive
and
judicial
powers
but
it
was
not
adopted
its
deliberate
rejection
is
much
more
significant
and
conclusive
than
if
it
had
never
been
proposed
correction
of
so
gross
an
error
as
that
of
confounding
the
government
with
the
constitution
ought
to
be
superfluous
but
so
crude
and
confused
are
the
ideas
which
have
been
propagated
on
the
subject
that
no
misconception
seems
to
be
too
absurd
to
be
possible
thus
it
has
not
been
uncommon
of
late
years
to
hear
even
in
the
highest
places
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
which
is
taken
by
both
state
and
federal
officers
spoken
of
as
an
oath
to
support
an
obligation
never
imposed
upon
any
one
in
this
country
and
which
the
men
who
made
the
constitution
with
their
recent
reminiscences
of
the
revolution
the
battles
of
which
they
had
fought
with
halters
around
their
necks
would
have
been
the
last
to
prescribe
could
any
assertion
be
less
credible
than
that
they
proceeded
to
institute
another
supreme
government
which
it
would
be
treason
to
resist
this
confusion
of
ideas
pervades
the
treatment
of
the
whole
subject
of
sovereignty
webster
has
said
and
very
justly
so
far
as
these
united
states
are
concerned
the
sovereignty
of
government
is
an
idea
belonging
to
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
no
such
thing
is
known
in
north
america
our
governments
are
all
limited
in
europe
sovereignty
is
of
feudal
origin
and
imports
no
more
than
the
state
of
the
sovereign
it
comprises
his
rights
duties
exemptions
prerogatives
and
powers
but
with
us
all
power
is
with
the
people
they
alone
are
sovereign
and
they
erect
what
governments
they
please
and
confer
on
them
such
powers
as
they
please
none
of
these
governments
are
sovereign
in
the
european
sense
of
the
word
all
being
restrained
by
written
constitutions
but
the
same
intellect
which
can
so
clearly
discern
and
so
lucidly
define
the
general
proposition
seems
to
be
covered
by
a
cloud
of
thick
darkness
when
it
comes
to
apply
it
to
the
particular
case
in
issue
thus
a
little
afterward
we
have
the
following
there
is
no
language
in
the
whole
constitution
applicable
to
a
confederation
of
states
if
the
states
be
parties
as
states
what
are
their
rights
and
what
their
respective
covenants
and
stipulations
and
where
are
their
rights
covenants
and
stipulations
expressed
in
the
articles
of
confederation
they
did
make
promises
and
did
enter
into
engagements
and
did
plight
the
faith
of
each
state
for
their
fulfillment
but
in
the
constitution
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
the
reason
is
that
in
the
constitution
it
is
the
people
who
speak
and
not
the
states
the
people
ordain
the
constitution
and
therein
address
themselves
to
the
states
and
to
the
legislatures
of
the
states
in
the
language
of
injunction
and
prohibition
it
is
surprising
that
such
inconsistent
ideas
should
proceed
from
a
source
so
eminent
its
author
falls
into
the
very
error
which
he
had
just
before
so
distinctly
pointed
out
in
confounding
the
people
of
the
states
with
their
governments
in
the
vehemence
of
his
hostility
to
state
sovereignty
he
seems
as
all
of
his
disciples
seem
unable
even
to
comprehend
that
it
means
the
sovereignty
not
of
state
governments
but
of
people
who
make
them
with
minds
preoccupied
by
the
unreal
idea
of
one
great
people
of
a
consolidated
nation
these
gentlemen
are
blinded
to
the
plain
and
primary
truth
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
people
ordained
the
constitution
was
as
the
people
of
states
when
webster
says
that
in
the
constitution
it
is
the
people
who
speak
and
not
the
states
he
says
what
is
untenable
the
states
the
people
the
people
do
not
speak
never
have
spoken
and
never
can
speak
in
their
sovereign
capacity
without
a
subversion
of
our
whole
system
otherwise
than
as
the
people
of
states
there
are
but
two
modes
of
expressing
their
sovereign
will
known
to
the
people
of
this
country
one
is
by
direct
vote
the
mode
adopted
by
rhode
island
in
when
she
rejected
the
constitution
the
other
is
the
method
more
generally
pursued
of
acting
by
means
of
conventions
of
delegates
elected
expressly
as
representatives
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
now
it
is
not
a
matter
of
opinion
or
theory
or
speculation
but
a
plain
undeniable
historical
that
there
never
has
been
any
act
or
expression
of
sovereignty
in
either
of
these
modes
by
that
imaginary
community
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
of
by
the
of
the
united
states
there
may
have
been
and
may
be
again
but
there
has
never
been
either
a
sovereign
convention
or
a
direct
vote
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
to
demonstrate
its
existence
as
a
corporate
unit
every
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
any
of
the
people
of
this
country
that
has
actually
taken
place
has
been
by
the
people
of
states
states
in
the
face
of
this
fact
is
it
not
the
merest
to
admit
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
deny
it
to
the
states
in
which
alone
they
have
community
existence
this
subject
is
one
of
such
vital
importance
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
events
which
this
work
is
designed
to
record
and
explain
that
it
can
not
be
dismissed
without
an
effort
in
the
way
of
recapitulation
and
conclusion
to
make
it
clear
beyond
the
possibility
of
misconception
according
to
the
american
theory
every
individual
is
endowed
with
certain
unalienable
rights
among
which
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
he
is
entitled
to
all
the
freedom
in
these
and
in
other
respects
that
is
consistent
with
the
safety
and
the
rights
of
others
and
the
weal
of
the
community
but
political
sovereignty
which
is
the
source
and
origin
of
all
the
powers
of
legislative
executive
and
judicial
belongs
to
and
inheres
in
the
people
of
an
organized
political
community
it
is
an
attribute
of
the
of
such
a
community
it
includes
the
power
and
necessarily
the
duty
of
protecting
the
rights
and
redressing
the
wrongs
of
individuals
of
punishing
crimes
enforcing
contracts
prescribing
rules
for
the
transfer
of
property
and
the
succession
of
estates
making
treaties
with
foreign
powers
levying
taxes
etc
the
enumeration
of
particulars
might
be
extended
but
these
will
suffice
as
illustrations
these
powers
are
of
course
exercised
through
the
agency
of
governments
but
the
governments
are
agents
of
the
sovereign
responsible
to
it
and
subject
to
its
control
this
sovereign
the
people
in
the
aggregate
of
each
political
community
delegates
to
the
government
the
exercise
of
such
powers
or
functions
as
it
thinks
proper
but
in
an
american
republic
never
transfers
or
surrenders
sovereignty
remains
unalienated
and
unimpaired
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
sovereignty
alone
that
the
government
its
authorized
agent
commands
the
obedience
of
the
individual
citizen
to
the
extent
of
its
derivative
dependent
and
delegated
authority
the
allegiance
of
the
citizen
is
due
to
the
sovereign
alone
thus
far
i
think
all
will
agree
no
american
statesman
or
publicist
would
venture
to
dispute
it
notwithstanding
the
inconsiderate
or
expressions
thrown
out
by
some
persons
about
the
unity
of
the
american
people
from
the
beginning
no
respectable
authority
has
ever
had
the
hardihood
to
deny
that
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
the
only
sovereign
political
community
was
the
people
of
the
state
the
people
of
the
ordinary
exercise
of
what
are
generally
termed
the
powers
of
sovereignty
was
by
and
through
their
respective
governments
and
when
they
formed
a
confederation
a
portion
of
those
powers
was
intrusted
to
the
general
government
or
agency
under
the
confederation
the
congress
of
the
united
states
represented
the
collective
power
of
the
states
but
the
people
of
each
state
alone
possessed
sovereignty
and
consequently
were
entitled
to
the
allegiance
of
the
citizen
when
the
articles
of
confederation
were
amended
when
the
new
constitution
was
substituted
in
their
place
and
the
general
government
reorganized
its
structure
was
changed
additional
powers
were
conferred
upon
it
and
thereby
subtracted
from
the
powers
theretofore
exercised
by
the
state
governments
but
the
seat
of
sovereignty
the
source
of
all
those
delegated
and
dependent
powers
was
not
disturbed
there
was
a
new
government
or
an
amended
government
it
is
entirely
immaterial
in
which
of
these
lights
we
consider
it
but
no
new
people
was
created
or
constituted
the
people
in
whom
alone
sovereignty
inheres
remained
just
as
they
had
been
before
the
only
change
was
in
the
form
structure
and
relations
of
their
governmental
agencies
no
doubt
the
states
the
people
of
the
states
if
they
had
been
so
disposed
might
have
merged
themselves
into
one
great
consolidated
state
retaining
their
geographical
boundaries
merely
as
matters
of
convenience
but
such
a
merger
must
have
been
distinctly
and
formally
stated
not
left
to
deduction
or
implication
men
do
not
alienate
even
an
estate
without
positive
and
express
terms
and
stipulations
but
in
this
case
not
only
was
there
no
express
transfer
no
formal
surrender
of
the
preëxisting
sovereignty
but
it
was
expressly
provided
that
nothing
should
be
as
even
that
everything
was
reserved
unless
granted
in
express
terms
the
monstrous
conception
of
the
creation
of
a
new
people
invested
with
the
whole
or
a
great
part
of
the
sovereignty
which
had
previously
belonged
to
the
people
of
each
state
has
not
a
syllable
to
sustain
it
in
the
constitution
but
is
built
up
entirely
upon
the
palpable
misconstruction
of
a
single
expression
in
the
preamble
in
denying
that
there
is
any
such
collective
unit
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
of
course
i
am
not
to
be
understood
as
denying
that
there
is
such
a
political
organization
as
the
united
states
or
that
there
exists
with
large
and
distinct
powers
a
of
the
united
states
but
it
is
claimed
that
the
union
as
its
name
implies
is
constituted
of
states
as
a
british
author
referring
to
the
old
teutonic
system
has
expressed
the
same
idea
the
states
are
the
integers
the
united
states
the
multiple
which
results
from
them
the
government
of
the
united
states
derives
its
existence
from
the
same
source
and
exercises
its
functions
by
the
will
of
the
same
sovereignty
that
creates
and
confers
authority
upon
the
state
governments
the
people
of
each
state
are
in
either
case
the
source
the
only
difference
is
that
in
the
creation
of
the
state
governments
each
sovereign
acted
alone
in
that
of
the
federal
government
they
acted
in
coöperation
with
the
others
neither
the
whole
nor
any
part
of
their
sovereignty
has
been
surrendered
to
either
government
to
whom
in
fine
the
states
have
surrendered
their
sovereignty
not
to
the
mass
of
the
people
inhabiting
the
territory
possessed
by
all
the
states
for
there
was
no
such
community
in
existence
and
they
took
no
measures
for
the
organization
of
such
a
community
if
they
had
intended
to
do
so
the
very
style
united
states
would
have
been
a
palpable
misnomer
nor
would
treason
have
been
defined
as
levying
war
against
could
it
have
been
transferred
to
the
government
of
the
union
clearly
not
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
and
principles
of
those
who
made
the
declaration
of
independence
adopted
the
articles
of
confederation
and
established
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
in
each
and
all
of
these
the
is
the
inherent
and
inalienable
sovereignty
of
the
people
to
have
transferred
sovereignty
from
the
people
to
a
government
would
have
been
to
have
fought
the
battles
of
the
revolution
in
vain
not
for
the
freedom
and
independence
of
the
states
but
for
a
mere
change
of
masters
such
a
thought
or
purpose
could
not
have
been
in
the
heads
or
hearts
of
those
who
molded
the
union
and
could
have
found
lodgment
only
when
the
ebbing
tide
of
patriotism
and
fraternity
had
swept
away
the
landmarks
which
they
erected
who
sought
by
the
compact
of
union
to
secure
and
perpetuate
the
liberties
then
possessed
the
men
who
had
won
at
great
cost
the
independence
of
their
respective
states
were
deeply
impressed
with
the
value
of
union
but
they
could
never
have
consented
like
the
base
judean
to
fling
away
the
priceless
pearl
of
state
sovereignty
for
any
possible
alliance

not
a
sectional
theory
looking
back
for
a
moment
at
the
ground
over
which
we
have
gone
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
asserted
that
the
following
propositions
have
been
clearly
and
fully
established
that
the
states
of
which
the
american
union
was
formed
from
the
moment
when
they
emerged
from
their
colonial
or
provincial
condition
became
severally
sovereign
free
and
independent
states
not
one
state
or
nation
that
the
union
formed
under
the
articles
of
confederation
was
a
compact
between
the
states
in
which
these
attributes
of
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
were
expressly
asserted
and
guaranteed
that
in
forming
the
more
perfect
union
of
the
constitution
afterward
adopted
the
same
contracting
powers
formed
an
without
any
surrender
of
these
attributes
of
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
either
expressed
or
implied
on
the
contrary
that
by
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
limiting
the
power
of
the
government
to
its
express
grants
they
distinctly
guarded
against
the
presumption
of
a
surrender
of
anything
by
implication
that
political
sovereignty
resides
neither
in
individual
citizens
nor
in
unorganized
masses
nor
in
fractional
subdivisions
of
a
community
but
in
the
people
of
an
organized
political
body
that
no
republican
form
of
government
in
the
sense
in
which
that
expression
is
used
in
the
constitution
and
was
generally
understood
by
the
founders
of
the
union
whether
it
be
the
government
of
a
state
or
of
a
confederation
of
states
is
possessed
of
any
sovereignty
whatever
but
merely
exercises
certain
powers
delegated
by
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
people
and
subject
to
recall
and
reassumption
by
the
same
authority
that
conferred
them
that
the
people
who
organized
the
first
confederation
the
people
who
dissolved
it
the
people
who
ordained
and
established
the
constitution
which
succeeded
it
the
only
people
in
fine
known
or
referred
to
in
the
phraseology
of
that
period
whether
the
term
was
used
collectively
or
distributively
were
the
people
of
the
respective
states
each
acting
separately
and
with
absolute
independence
of
the
others
that
in
forming
and
adopting
the
constitution
the
states
or
the
people
of
the
states
terms
which
when
used
with
reference
to
acts
performed
in
a
sovereign
capacity
are
precisely
equivalent
to
each
other
formed
a
new
but
no
new
and
that
consequently
no
new
sovereignty
was
created
for
sovereignty
in
an
american
republic
can
belong
only
to
a
people
never
to
a
government
and
that
the
federal
government
is
entitled
to
exercise
only
the
powers
delegated
to
it
by
the
people
of
the
respective
states
that
the
term
people
in
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
and
in
the
tenth
amendment
is
used
distributively
that
the
only
people
of
the
united
states
known
to
the
constitution
are
the
people
of
each
state
in
the
union
that
no
such
political
community
or
corporate
unit
as
one
people
of
the
united
states
then
existed
has
ever
been
organized
or
yet
exists
and
that
no
political
action
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
has
ever
taken
place
or
ever
can
take
place
under
the
constitution
the
fictitious
idea
of
people
of
the
united
states
contradicted
in
the
last
paragraph
has
been
so
impressed
upon
the
popular
mind
by
false
teaching
by
careless
and
vicious
phraseology
and
by
the
spectacle
of
a
great
government
with
its
army
and
navy
its
and
its
multitude
of
and
the
splendid
prizes
which
it
offers
to
political
ambition
that
the
tearing
away
of
these
illusions
and
presentation
of
the
original
fabric
which
they
have
overgrown
and
hidden
from
view
have
no
doubt
been
unwelcome
distasteful
and
even
repellent
to
some
of
my
readers
the
artificial
splendor
which
makes
the
deception
attractive
is
even
employed
as
an
argument
to
prove
its
reality
the
glitter
of
the
powers
delegated
to
the
agent
serves
to
obscure
the
perception
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
principal
by
whom
they
are
conferred
as
by
the
unpracticed
eye
the
showy
costume
and
conspicuous
functions
of
the
are
mistaken
for
emblems
of
chieftaincy
while
the
misuse
or
ambiguous
use
of
the
term
union
and
its
congeners
contributes
to
increase
the
confusion
so
much
the
more
need
for
insisting
upon
the
elementary
truths
which
have
been
obscured
by
these
specious
sophistries
the
reader
really
desirous
of
ascertaining
truth
is
therefore
again
cautioned
against
confounding
two
ideas
so
essentially
distinct
as
that
of
which
is
derivative
dependent
and
subordinate
with
that
of
the
as
an
organized
political
community
which
is
sovereign
without
any
other
than
limitations
and
such
as
proceed
from
the
general
principles
of
the
personal
rights
of
man
it
has
been
said
in
a
foregoing
chapter
that
the
authors
of
the
constitution
could
scarcely
have
anticipated
the
idea
of
such
a
community
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
one
mass
perhaps
this
expression
needs
some
little
qualification
for
there
is
rarely
a
fallacy
however
stupendous
that
is
wholly
original
a
careful
examination
of
the
records
of
the
convention
of
exhibits
one
or
perhaps
two
instances
of
such
a
suggestion
both
by
the
same
person
and
the
result
in
each
case
is
strikingly
significant
the
original
proposition
made
concerning
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
contemplated
his
election
by
the
congress
or
as
it
was
termed
by
the
proposer
the
national
legislature
on
the
of
july
this
proposition
being
under
consideration
gouverneur
morris
moved
that
the
words
national
legislature
be
stricken
out
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
inserted
the
proposition
was
supported
by
james
wilson
both
of
these
gentlemen
being
delegates
from
pennsylvania
and
both
among
the
most
earnest
advocates
of
centralism
in
the
convention
now
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
morris
had
in
view
an
election
by
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
the
aggregate
voting
as
the
language
of
his
proposition
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
idea
of
as
election
by
the
citizens
of
each
state
voting
separately
and
independently
though
it
is
ambiguous
and
may
admit
of
the
other
construction
but
this
is
immaterial
the
proposition
was
submitted
to
a
vote
and
received
the
approval
of
only
pennsylvania
of
which
morris
and
wilson
were
both
representatives
states
voted
against
it
six
days
afterward
july
in
a
discussion
of
the
proposed
ratification
of
the
constitution
by
conventions
of
the
people
of
each
state
gouverneur
morris
as
we
learn
from
madison
moved
that
the
reference
of
the
plan
of
the
proposed
constitution
be
made
to
one
general
convention
chosen
and
authorized
by
the
people
to
consider
amend
and
establish
the
same
here
the
issue
seems
to
have
been
more
distinctly
made
between
the
two
ideas
of
people
of
the
states
and
one
people
in
the
aggregate
the
fate
of
the
latter
is
briefly
recorded
in
the
two
words
not
seconded
morris
was
a
man
of
distinguished
ability
great
personal
influence
and
undoubted
patriotism
but
out
of
all
that
assemblage
comprising
as
it
did
such
admitted
friends
of
centralism
as
hamilton
king
wilson
randolph
pinckney
and
others
there
was
not
one
to
sustain
him
in
the
proposition
to
incorporate
into
the
constitution
that
theory
which
now
predominates
the
theory
on
which
was
waged
the
late
bloody
war
which
was
called
a
war
for
the
union
it
failed
for
want
of
a
second
and
does
not
even
appear
in
the
official
journal
of
the
convention
the
very
fact
that
such
a
suggestion
was
made
would
be
unknown
to
us
but
for
the
record
kept
by
madison
the
extracts
which
have
been
given
in
treating
of
special
branches
of
the
subject
from
the
writings
and
speeches
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
other
statesmen
of
that
period
afford
ample
proof
of
their
entire
and
almost
unanimous
accord
with
the
principles
which
have
been
established
on
the
authority
of
the
constitution
itself
the
acts
of
ratification
by
the
several
states
and
other
attestations
of
the
highest
authority
and
validity
i
am
well
aware
that
isolated
expressions
may
be
found
in
the
reports
of
debates
on
the
general
and
state
conventions
and
other
public
bodies
indicating
the
existence
of
individual
opinions
seemingly
inconsistent
with
these
principles
that
loose
and
confused
ideas
were
sometimes
expressed
with
regard
to
sovereignty
the
relations
between
governments
and
people
and
kindred
subjects
and
that
while
the
plan
of
the
constitution
was
under
discussion
and
before
it
was
definitely
reduced
to
its
present
shape
there
were
earnest
advocates
in
the
convention
of
a
more
consolidated
system
with
a
stronger
central
government
but
these
expressions
of
individual
opinion
only
prove
the
existence
of
a
small
minority
of
dissentients
from
the
principles
generally
entertained
and
which
finally
prevailed
in
the
formation
of
the
constitution
none
of
these
ever
avowed
such
extravagances
of
doctrine
as
are
promulgated
in
this
generation
no
statesman
of
that
day
would
have
ventured
to
risk
his
reputation
by
construing
an
obligation
to
support
the
constitution
as
an
obligation
to
adhere
to
the
federal
government
a
construction
which
would
have
insured
the
sweeping
away
of
any
plan
of
union
embodying
it
by
a
tempest
of
popular
indignation
from
every
quarter
of
the
country
none
of
them
suggested
such
an
idea
as
that
of
the
amalgamation
of
the
people
of
the
states
into
one
consolidated
mass
unless
it
was
suggested
by
gouverneur
morris
in
the
proposition
above
referred
to
in
which
he
stood
alone
among
the
delegates
of
twelve
sovereign
states
assembled
in
convention
as
to
the
features
of
centralism
or
nationalism
which
they
did
advocate
all
the
ability
of
this
little
minority
of
really
gifted
men
failed
to
secure
the
incorporation
of
any
one
of
them
into
the
constitution
or
to
obtain
their
recognition
by
any
of
the
ratifying
states
on
the
contrary
the
very
men
who
had
been
the
leading
advocates
of
such
theories
on
failing
to
secure
their
adoption
loyally
accepted
the
result
and
became
the
ablest
and
most
efficient
supporters
of
the
principles
which
had
prevailed
thus
hamilton
who
had
favored
the
plan
of
a
president
and
senate
both
elected
to
hold
office
for
life
or
during
good
behavior
with
a
veto
power
in
congress
on
the
action
of
the
state
legislatures
became
through
the
federalist
in
conjunction
with
his
associates
madison
and
jay
the
most
distinguished
expounder
and
advocate
of
the
constitution
as
then
proposed
and
afterward
ratified
with
all
its
federal
and
features
in
the
ninth
number
of
that
remarkable
series
of
political
essays
he
quotes
adopts
and
applies
to
the
then
proposed
constitution
montesquieu
description
of
a
confederate
republic
a
term
which
he
hamilton
repeatedly
employs
in
the
number
of
the
same
series
replying
to
apprehensions
expressed
by
some
that
a
state
might
be
brought
before
the
federal
courts
to
answer
as
defendant
in
suits
instituted
against
her
he
repels
the
idea
in
these
plain
and
conclusive
terms
the
italics
are
my
own
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
not
to
be
amenable
to
the
suit
of
any
individual
without
its
consent
this
is
the
general
sense
and
the
general
practice
of
mankind
and
the
exemption
as
one
of
the
of
is
now
enjoyed
by
the
government
of
state
in
the
unless
therefore
there
is
surrender
of
this
in
the
plan
of
the
convention
will
remain
with
the
and
the
danger
intimated
must
be
merely
ideal
the
contracts
between
and
individuals
are
only
binding
on
the
conscience
of
and
have
no
pretensions
to
a
compulsive
force
they
confer
no
right
of
action
independent
of
sovereign
to
what
purpose
would
it
be
to
authorize
suits
against
states
for
the
debts
they
owe
how
could
recoveries
be
enforced
it
is
evident
that
it
could
not
be
done
without
against
the
contracting
state
and
to
ascribe
to
the
federal
courts
by
mere
implication
and
in
destruction
of
a
preëxisting
right
of
the
state
governments
a
power
which
would
involve
such
a
consequence
would
be
altogether
forced
and
unwarranted
this
extract
is
very
significant
clearly
showing
that
hamilton
assumed
as
undisputed
propositions
in
the
first
place
that
the
state
was
sovereign
secondly
that
this
sovereignty
could
not
be
alienated
unless
by
express
surrender
thirdly
that
no
such
surrender
had
been
made
and
fourthly
that
the
idea
of
applying
coercion
to
a
state
even
to
enforce
the
fulfillment
of
a
duty
would
be
equivalent
to
waging
war
against
a
state
it
was
altogether
forced
and
unwarrantable
in
a
subsequent
number
hamilton
replying
to
the
objection
that
the
constitution
contains
no
bill
or
declaration
of
rights
argues
that
it
was
entirely
unnecessary
because
in
reality
the
people
that
is
of
course
the
people
respectively
of
the
several
states
who
were
the
only
people
known
to
the
constitution
or
to
the
country
had
surrendered
nothing
of
their
inherent
sovereignty
but
retained
it
unimpaired
he
says
here
in
strictness
the
people
and
as
they
they
have
no
need
of
particular
reservations
and
again
i
go
further
and
affirm
that
bills
of
rights
in
the
sense
and
to
the
extent
they
are
contended
for
are
not
only
unnecessary
in
the
proposed
constitution
but
would
be
absolutely
dangerous
they
would
contain
various
exceptions
to
not
and
on
this
very
account
would
afford
a
colorable
pretext
to
claim
more
than
were
granted
for
why
declare
that
things
shall
not
be
done
which
there
is
no
power
to
do
could
language
be
more
clear
or
more
complete
in
vindication
of
the
principles
laid
down
in
this
work
hamilton
declares
in
effect
that
the
grants
to
the
federal
government
in
the
constitution
are
not
surrenders
but
delegations
of
power
by
the
people
of
the
states
that
sovereignty
remains
intact
where
it
was
before
and
that
the
delegations
of
power
were
strictly
limited
to
those
expressly
granted
in
this
merely
anticipating
the
tenth
amendment
afterward
adopted
finally
in
the
concluding
article
of
the
federalist
he
bears
emphatic
testimony
to
the
same
principles
in
the
remark
that
every
constitution
for
the
united
states
must
inevitably
consist
of
a
great
variety
of
particulars
in
which
independent
are
to
be
accommodated
in
their
interests
or
opinions
of
interest
hence
the
necessity
of
molding
and
arranging
all
the
particulars
which
are
to
compose
the
whole
in
such
a
manner
as
to
satisfy
the
to
the
compact
there
is
no
intimation
here
or
anywhere
else
of
the
existence
of
any
such
idea
as
that
of
the
aggregated
people
of
one
great
consolidated
state
it
is
an
incidental
enunciation
of
the
same
truth
soon
afterward
asserted
by
madison
in
the
virginia
convention
that
the
people
who
ordained
and
established
the
constitution
were
not
the
people
as
composing
one
great
body
but
the
people
as
composing
thirteen
sovereignties
madison
in
the
philadelphia
convention
had
at
first
held
views
of
the
sort
of
government
which
it
was
desirable
to
organize
similar
to
those
of
hamilton
though
more
moderate
in
extent
he
too
however
cordially
conformed
to
the
modifications
in
them
made
by
his
colleagues
and
was
no
less
zealous
and
eminent
in
defending
and
expounding
the
constitution
as
finally
adopted
his
interpretation
of
its
fundamental
principles
is
so
fully
shown
in
the
extracts
which
have
already
been
given
from
his
contributions
to
the
federalist
and
speeches
in
the
virginia
convention
that
it
would
be
superfluous
to
make
any
additional
citation
from
them
the
evidence
of
hamilton
and
madison
two
of
the
most
eminent
of
the
authors
of
the
constitution
and
the
two
preeminent
contemporary
expounders
of
its
meaning
is
the
most
valuable
that
could
be
offered
for
its
interpretation
that
of
all
the
other
statesmen
of
the
period
only
tends
to
confirm
the
same
conclusions
the
illustrious
washington
who
presided
over
the
philadelphia
convention
in
his
correspondence
repeatedly
refers
to
the
proposed
union
as
a
confederacy
of
states
or
a
confederated
government
and
to
the
several
states
as
acceding
or
signifying
their
accession
to
it
in
ratifying
the
constitution
he
refers
to
the
constitution
itself
as
a
compact
or
treaty
and
classifies
it
among
compacts
or
treaties
between
men
bodies
of
men
or
countries
writing
to
count
rochambeau
on
january
he
says
that
the
proposed
constitution
is
to
be
submitted
to
conventions
chosen
by
people
in
the
several
and
by
them
approved
or
rejected
showing
what
understood
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
were
to
ordain
and
establish
it
these
same
people
that
is
the
people
of
the
several
states
he
says
in
a
letter
to
lafayette
april
retain
everything
they
do
not
by
express
terms
give
up
in
a
letter
written
to
benjamin
lincoln
october
he
refers
to
the
expectation
that
north
carolina
will
accede
to
the
union
and
adds
whoever
shall
be
found
to
enjoy
the
confidence
of
so
far
as
to
be
elected
showing
that
in
the
confederated
government
as
he
termed
it
the
states
were
still
to
act
independently
even
in
the
selection
of
officers
of
the
general
government
he
wrote
to
general
knox
june
i
can
not
but
hope
that
the
states
which
may
be
disposed
to
make
a
secession
will
think
often
and
seriously
on
the
consequences
june
he
wrote
to
general
pinckney
that
new
hampshire
had
acceded
to
the
new
confederacy
and
in
reference
to
north
carolina
i
should
be
astonished
if
that
state
should
withdraw
from
the
union
i
shall
add
but
two
other
citations
they
are
from
speeches
of
john
marshall
afterward
the
most
distinguished
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
who
has
certainly
never
been
regarded
as
holding
high
views
of
state
rights
in
the
virginia
convention
of
in
the
first
case
he
was
speaking
of
the
power
of
the
states
over
the
militia
and
is
thus
reported
the
state
governments
did
not
derive
their
powers
from
the
general
government
but
each
government
derived
its
powers
from
the
people
and
each
was
to
act
according
to
the
powers
given
it
would
any
gentleman
deny
this
could
any
man
say
that
this
power
was
not
retained
by
the
states
as
they
had
not
given
it
away
for
says
he
does
not
a
power
remain
till
it
is
given
away
the
state
legislatures
had
power
to
command
and
govern
their
militia
before
and
have
it
still
undeniably
unless
there
be
something
in
this
constitution
that
takes
it
away
he
concluded
by
observing
that
the
power
of
governing
the
militia
was
not
vested
in
the
states
by
implication
because
being
possessed
of
it
antecedently
to
the
adoption
of
the
government
and
not
being
divested
of
it
by
any
grant
or
restriction
in
the
constitution
they
must
necessarily
be
as
fully
possessed
of
it
as
ever
they
had
been
and
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
states
derived
any
powers
from
that
system
but
retained
them
though
not
acknowledged
in
any
part
of
it
in
the
other
case
the
special
subject
was
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
marshall
said
with
regard
to
this
i
hope
that
no
gentleman
will
think
that
a
state
can
be
called
at
the
bar
of
the
federal
court
is
there
no
such
case
at
present
are
there
not
many
cases
in
which
the
legislature
of
virginia
is
a
party
and
yet
the
state
is
not
sued
is
it
rational
to
suppose
that
the
sovereign
power
shall
be
dragged
before
a
court
authorities
to
the
same
effect
might
be
multiplied
indefinitely
by
quotation
from
nearly
all
the
most
eminent
statesmen
and
patriots
of
that
brilliant
period
my
limits
however
permit
me
only
to
refer
those
in
quest
of
more
exhaustive
information
to
the
original
records
or
to
the
republic
of
republics
in
which
will
be
found
a
most
valuable
collection
and
condensation
of
the
teaching
of
the
fathers
on
the
subject
there
was
no
dissent
at
that
period
from
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
which
i
have
set
forth
as
given
by
its
authors
except
in
the
objections
made
by
its
adversaries
those
objections
were
refuted
and
silenced
until
revived
long
afterward
and
presented
as
the
true
interpretation
by
the
school
of
which
judge
story
was
the
most
effective
founder
at
an
earlier
period
but
when
he
had
already
served
for
several
years
in
congress
and
had
attained
the
full
maturity
of
his
powers
webster
held
the
views
which
were
presented
in
a
memorial
to
congress
of
citizens
of
boston
december
relative
to
the
admission
of
missouri
drawn
up
and
signed
by
a
committee
of
which
he
was
chairman
and
which
also
included
among
its
members
josiah
quincy
he
speaks
of
the
states
as
enjoying
exclusive
possession
of
over
their
own
territory
calls
the
united
states
the
american
confederacy
and
says
the
only
to
the
contemplated
by
it
originally
were
the
confederated
and
again
as
between
the
original
states
the
representation
rests
on
and
plighted
and
your
memorialists
have
no
wish
that
that
compact
should
be
disturbed
or
that
plighted
faith
in
the
slightest
degree
violated
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
in
the
closing
year
of
his
life
when
looking
retrospectively
with
judgment
undisturbed
by
any
extraneous
influence
he
uttered
views
of
the
government
which
must
stand
the
test
of
severest
scrutiny
and
defy
the
storms
of
agitation
for
they
are
founded
on
the
rock
of
truth
in
letters
written
and
addresses
delivered
during
the
administration
of
fillmore
he
repeatedly
applies
to
the
constitution
the
term
compact
which
in
he
had
so
vehemently
repudiated
in
his
speech
at
capon
springs
virginia
in
he
says
if
the
south
were
to
violate
any
part
of
the
constitution
intentionally
and
systematically
and
persist
in
so
doing
year
after
year
and
no
remedy
could
be
had
would
the
north
be
any
longer
bound
by
the
rest
of
it
and
if
the
north
were
deliberately
habitually
and
of
fixed
purpose
to
disregard
one
part
of
it
would
the
south
be
bound
any
longer
to
observe
its
other
obligations
how
absurd
it
is
to
suppose
that
when
different
parties
enter
into
a
compact
for
certain
purposes
either
can
disregard
any
one
provision
and
expect
nevertheless
the
other
to
observe
the
rest
i
have
not
hesitated
to
say
and
i
repeat
that
if
the
northern
states
refuse
willfully
and
deliberately
to
carry
into
effect
that
part
of
the
constitution
which
respects
the
restoration
of
fugitive
slaves
and
congress
provide
no
remedy
the
south
would
no
longer
be
bound
to
observe
the
compact
a
bargain
can
not
be
broken
on
one
side
and
still
bind
the
other
side
the
principles
which
have
been
set
forth
in
the
foregoing
chapters
although
they
had
come
to
be
considered
as
peculiarly
southern
were
not
sectional
in
their
origin
in
the
beginning
and
earlier
years
of
our
history
they
were
cherished
as
faithfully
and
guarded
as
jealously
in
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
as
in
virginia
or
south
carolina
it
was
in
these
principles
that
i
was
nurtured
i
have
frankly
proclaimed
them
during
my
whole
life
always
contending
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
against
what
i
believed
to
be
the
mistaken
construction
of
the
constitution
taught
by
webster
and
his
adherents
while
i
honored
the
genius
of
that
great
man
and
held
friendly
personal
relations
with
him
i
considered
his
doctrines
on
these
points
or
rather
the
doctrines
advocated
by
him
during
the
most
conspicuous
and
influential
portions
of
his
public
career
to
be
mischievous
and
the
more
dangerous
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
the
liberties
of
mankind
on
account
of
the
signal
ability
and

the
right
of
the
law
of
unlimited
the
perpetual
union
of
the
articles
of
confederation
and
the
more
perfect
union
of
the
the
important
powers
conferred
upon
the
federal
government
and
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
compact
the

in
both
the
right
to
resume
grants
when
failing
to
fulfill
their
purposes
expressly
and
distinctly
asserted
in
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
right
of
secession
that
subject
which
beyond
all
others
ignorance
prejudice
and
political
rancor
have
combined
to
cloud
with
misstatements
and
misapprehensions
is
a
question
easily
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
what
has
already
been
established
with
regard
to
the
history
and
principles
of
the
constitution
it
is
not
something
standing
apart
by
itself
a
factious
creation
outside
of
and
antagonistic
to
the
constitution
as
might
be
imagined
by
one
deriving
his
ideas
from
the
political
literature
most
current
of
late
years
so
far
from
being
against
the
constitution
or
incompatible
with
it
we
contend
that
if
the
right
to
secede
is
not
prohibited
to
the
states
and
no
power
to
prevent
it
expressly
delegated
to
the
united
states
it
remains
as
reserved
to
the
states
or
the
people
from
whom
all
the
powers
of
the
general
government
were
derived
the
compact
between
the
states
which
formed
the
union
was
in
the
nature
of
a
partnership
between
individuals
without
limitation
of
time
and
the
recognized
law
of
such
partnerships
is
thus
stated
by
an
eminent
lawyer
of
massachusetts
in
a
work
intended
for
popular
use
if
the
articles
between
the
partners
do
not
contain
an
agreement
that
the
partnership
shall
continue
for
a
specified
time
it
may
be
dissolved
at
the
pleasure
of
either
partner
but
no
partner
can
exercise
this
power
wantonly
and
injuriously
to
the
other
partners
without
making
himself
responsible
for
the
damage
he
thus
causes
if
there
be
a
provision
that
the
partnership
shall
continue
a
certain
time
this
is
binding
we
have
seen
that
a
number
of
sovereign
free
and
independent
states
during
the
war
of
the
revolution
entered
into
a
partnership
with
one
another
which
was
not
only
unlimited
in
duration
but
expressly
declared
to
be
a
perpetual
union
yet
when
that
union
failed
to
accomplish
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
formed
the
parties
withdrew
separately
and
independently
one
after
another
without
any
question
made
of
their
right
to
do
so
and
formed
a
new
association
one
of
the
declared
objects
of
this
new
partnership
was
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
this
certainly
did
not
mean
more
perfect
in
respect
of
duration
for
the
former
union
had
been
declared
perpetual
and
perpetuity
admits
of
no
addition
it
did
not
mean
that
it
was
to
be
more
indissoluble
for
the
delegates
of
the
states
in
ratifying
the
former
compact
of
union
had
expressed
themselves
in
terms
that
could
scarcely
be
made
more
stringent
they
then
said
and
we
do
further
plight
and
engage
the
faith
of
our
respective
that
they
shall
abide
by
the
determinations
of
the
united
states
in
congress
assembled
on
all
questions
which
by
the
said
confederation
are
submitted
to
them
and
that
the
articles
thereof
shall
be
by
the
states
we
respectively
represent
and
that
union
shall
be
the
formation
of
a
more
perfect
union
was
accomplished
by
the
organization
of
a
government
more
complete
in
its
various
branches
legislative
executive
and
judicial
and
by
the
delegation
to
this
government
of
certain
additional
powers
or
functions
which
had
previously
been
exercised
by
the
governments
of
the
respective
states
especially
in
providing
the
means
of
operating
directly
upon
individuals
for
the
enforcement
of
its
legitimately
delegated
authority
there
was
no
abandonment
nor
modification
of
the
essential
principle
of
a
between
sovereigns
which
applied
to
the
one
case
as
fully
as
to
the
other
there
was
not
the
slightest
intimation
of
so
radical
a
revolution
as
the
surrender
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
contracting
parties
would
have
been
the
additional
powers
conferred
upon
the
federal
government
by
the
constitution
were
merely
transfers
of
some
of
those
possessed
by
the
state
governments
not
subtractions
from
the
reserved
and
inalienable
sovereignty
of
the
political
communities
which
conferred
them
it
was
merely
the
institution
of
a
new
agent
who
however
enlarged
his
powers
might
be
would
still
remain
subordinate
and
responsible
to
the
source
from
which
they
were
derived
that
of
the
sovereign
people
of
each
state
it
was
an
amended
union
not
a
consolidation
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
very
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
prohibitions
to
the
states
which
are
most
relied
upon
by
the
advocates
of
centralism
as
incompatible
with
state
sovereignty
were
in
force
under
the
old
confederation
when
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
was
expressly
recognized
the
general
government
had
then
as
now
the
exclusive
right
and
power
of
determining
on
peace
and
war
making
treaties
and
alliances
maintaining
an
army
and
navy
granting
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
regulating
coinage
establishing
and
controlling
the
postal
service
indeed
nearly
all
the
characteristic
powers
of
sovereignty
exercised
by
the
federal
government
under
the
existing
constitution
except
the
regulation
of
commerce
and
of
levying
and
collecting
its
revenues
directly
instead
of
through
the
interposition
of
the
state
authorities
the
exercise
of
these
powers
was
prohibited
to
the
states
under
the
old
compact
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states
in
congress
assembled
but
no
one
has
claimed
that
the
confederation
had
thereby
acquired
sovereignty
entirely
in
accord
with
these
truths
are
the
arguments
of
madison
in
the
federalist
to
show
that
the
great
principles
of
the
constitution
are
substantially
the
same
as
those
of
the
articles
of
confederation
he
says
i
ask
what
are
these
principles
do
they
require
that
in
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
the
states
should
be
regarded
as
distinct
and
independent
sovereigns
they
so
regarded
by
the
constitution
proposed
do
these
principles
in
fine
require
that
the
powers
of
the
general
government
should
be
limited
and
that
beyond
this
limit
the
states
should
be
left
in
possession
of
their
sovereignty
and
independence
we
have
seen
that
in
the
new
government
as
in
the
old
the
general
powers
are
limited
and
that
the
states
in
all
unenumerated
cases
are
left
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
sovereign
and
independent
jurisdiction
the
truth
is
he
adds
that
the
great
principles
of
the
constitution
proposed
by
the
convention
may
be
considered
as
absolutely
new
than
as
the
expansion
of
principles
which
are
found
in
the
articles
of
in
the
papers
immediately
following
he
establishes
this
position
in
detail
by
an
analysis
of
the
principal
powers
delegated
to
the
federal
government
showing
that
the
spirit
of
the
original
instructions
to
the
convention
had
been
followed
in
revising
the
federal
constitution
and
rendering
it
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
the
present
union
owes
its
very
existence
to
the
dissolution
by
separate
secession
of
its
members
of
the
former
union
which
as
we
have
thus
seen
as
to
its
rested
upon
precisely
the
same
foundation
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
association
results
in
either
case
from
the
same
principles
principles
which
i
think
have
been
established
on
an
impregnable
basis
of
history
reason
law
and
precedent
it
is
not
contended
that
this
right
should
be
resorted
to
for
insufficient
cause
or
as
the
writer
already
quoted
on
the
law
of
partnership
says
wantonly
and
injuriously
to
the
other
partners
without
responsibility
of
the
seceding
party
for
any
damage
thus
done
no
association
can
be
dissolved
without
a
likelihood
of
the
occurrence
of
incidental
questions
concerning
common
property
and
mutual
obligations
questions
sometimes
of
a
complex
and
intricate
sort
if
a
wrong
be
perpetrated
in
such
case
it
is
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
means
usually
employed
among
independent
and
sovereign
powers
negotiation
arbitration
or
in
the
failure
of
these
by
war
with
which
unfortunately
christianity
and
civilization
have
not
yet
been
able
entirely
to
dispense
but
the
suggestion
of
possible
evils
does
not
at
all
affect
the
question
of
right
there
is
no
great
principle
in
the
affairs
either
of
individuals
or
of
nations
that
is
not
liable
to
such
difficulties
in
its
practical
application
but
we
are
told
there
is
no
mention
made
of
secession
in
the
constitution
everett
says
the
states
are
not
named
in
it
the
word
sovereignty
does
not
occur
in
it
the
right
of
secession
is
as
much
ignored
in
it
as
the
procession
of
the
equinoxes
we
have
seen
how
very
untenable
is
the
assertion
that
the
states
are
not
named
in
it
and
how
much
pertinency
or
significance
in
the
omission
of
the
sovereignty
the
pertinent
question
that
occurs
is
why
was
so
obvious
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
not
expressly
renounced
if
it
was
intended
to
surrender
it
it
certainly
existed
it
was
not
surrendered
therefore
it
still
exists
this
would
be
a
more
natural
and
rational
conclusion
than
that
it
has
ceased
to
exist
because
it
is
not
mentioned
the
simple
truth
is
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
extraordinary
thing
to
incorporate
into
the
constitution
any
express
provision
for
the
secession
of
the
states
and
dissolution
of
the
union
its
founders
undoubtedly
desired
and
hoped
that
it
would
be
perpetual
against
the
proposition
for
power
to
coerce
a
state
the
argument
was
that
it
would
be
a
means
not
of
preserving
but
of
destroying
the
union
it
was
not
for
them
to
make
arrangements
for
its
termination
a
calamity
which
there
was
no
occasion
to
provide
for
in
advance
sufficient
for
their
day
was
the
evil
thereof
it
is
not
usual
either
in
partnerships
between
men
or
in
treaties
between
governments
to
make
provision
for
a
dissolution
of
the
partnership
or
a
termination
of
the
treaty
unless
there
be
some
special
reason
for
a
limitation
of
time
indeed
in
treaties
the
usual
formula
includes
a
declaration
of
their
but
in
either
case
the
power
of
the
contracting
parties
or
of
any
of
them
to
dissolve
the
compact
on
terms
not
damaging
to
the
rights
of
the
other
parties
is
not
the
less
clearly
understood
it
was
not
necessary
in
the
constitution
to
affirm
the
right
of
secession
because
it
was
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
and
the
states
had
reserved
all
which
they
had
not
delegated
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
several
states
to
resume
the
powers
delegated
by
them
to
the
common
agency
was
not
left
without
positive
and
ample
assertion
even
at
a
period
when
it
had
never
been
denied
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
by
virginia
has
already
been
quoted
in
which
the
people
of
that
state
through
their
convention
did
expressly
declare
and
make
known
that
the
powers
granted
under
the
constitution
being
derived
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
be
resumed
by
whensoever
the
same
shall
be
perverted
to
their
injury
or
oppression
and
that
every
power
not
granted
thereby
remains
with
them
and
at
their
will
new
york
and
rhode
island
were
no
less
explicit
both
declaring
that
the
powers
of
government
be
reassumed
by
the
whenever
it
shall
become
necessary
to
their
happiness
these
expressions
are
not
mere
thrown
out
incidentally
and
entitled
only
to
be
regarded
as
an
expression
of
opinion
by
their
authors
even
if
only
such
they
would
carry
great
weight
as
the
deliberately
expressed
judgment
of
enlightened
contemporaries
but
they
are
more
they
are
parts
of
the
very
acts
or
ordinances
by
which
these
states
ratified
the
constitution
and
acceded
to
the
union
and
can
not
be
detached
from
them
if
they
are
invalid
the
ratification
itself
was
invalid
for
they
are
inseparable
by
inserting
these
declarations
in
their
ordinances
virginia
new
york
and
rhode
island
formally
officially
and
permanently
declared
their
interpretation
of
the
constitution
as
recognizing
the
right
of
secession
by
the
resumption
of
their
grants
by
accepting
the
ratifications
with
this
declaration
incorporated
the
other
states
as
formally
accepted
the
principle
which
it
asserted
i
am
well
aware
that
it
has
been
attempted
to
construe
these
declarations
concerning
the
right
of
to
reassume
their
delegations
of
power
especially
in
the
terms
employed
by
virginia
people
of
the
united
states
as
having
reference
to
the
idea
of
in
mass
or
in
the
aggregate
but
it
can
scarcely
be
possible
that
any
candid
and
intelligent
reader
who
has
carefully
considered
the
evidence
already
brought
to
bear
on
the
subject
can
need
further
argument
to
disabuse
his
mind
of
that
political
fiction
the
people
of
the
united
states
from
whom
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
were
derived
have
no
other
than
the
people
who
ordained
and
ratified
the
constitution
and
this
it
has
been
shown
beyond
the
power
of
denial
was
done
by
the
people
of
severally
and
independently
no
other
were
known
to
the
authors
of
the
declarations
above
quoted
madison
was
a
leading
member
of
the
virginia
convention
which
made
that
declaration
as
well
as
of
the
general
convention
that
drew
up
the
constitution
we
have
seen
what
idea
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
was
not
the
people
as
composing
one
great
body
but
the
people
as
composing
thirteen
sovereignties
lee

in
the
same
convention
answering

to
the
expression
we
the
people
said
it
the
constitution
is
now
submitted
to
people
of
if
we
do
not
adopt
it
it
will
be
always
null
and
void
as
to
us
suppose
it
was
found
proper
for
our
adoption
and
becoming
the
government
of
people
of
by
what
style
should
it
be
done
ought
we
not
to
make
use
of
the
name
of
the
people
no
other
style
would
be
proper
it
would
certainly
be
superfluous
after
all
that
has
been
presented
heretofore
to
add
any
further
evidence
of
the
meaning
that
was
attached
to
these
expressions
by
their
authors
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
in
their
minds
the
people
of
virginia
the
people
of
massachusetts
and
the
people
of
every
other
state
that
should
agree
to
unite
they
have
meant
only
that
the
people
of
their
respective
states
who
had
delegated
certain
powers
to
the
federal
government
in
ratifying
the
constitution
and
to
the
union
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
in
event
of
the
failure
of
their
purposes
to
resume
or
reassume
those
powers
by
from
the
same
union
finally
the
absurdity
of
the
construction
attempted
to
be
put
upon
these
expressions
will
be
evident
from
a
very
brief
analysis
if
the
assertion
of
the
right
of
reassumption
of
their
powers
was
meant
for
the
protection
of
whole
the
people
in
mass
the
people
in
the
aggregate
of
a
consolidated
republic
against
whom
or
what
was
it
to
protect
them
by
whom
were
the
powers
granted
to
be
perverted
to
the
injury
or
oppression
of
the
whole
people
by
themselves
or
by
some
of
the
states
all
of
whom
according
to
this
hypothesis
had
been
consolidated
into
one
as
no
danger
could
have
been
apprehended
from
either
of
these
it
must
have
been
against
the
of
the
united
states
that
the
provision
was
made
that
is
to
say
the
whole
people
of
a
republic
make
this
declaration
against
a
government
established
by
themselves
and
entirely
subject
to
their
own
control
under
a
constitution
which
contains
provision
for
its
own
amendment
by
this
very
same
whole
people
whenever
they
may
think
proper
is
it
not
a
libel
upon
the
statesmen
of
that
generation
to
attribute
to
their
grave
and
solemn
declarations
a
meaning
so
vapid
and
absurd
to
those
who
argue
that
the
grants
of
the
constitution
are
fatal
to
the
reservation
of
sovereignty
by
the
states
the
constitution
furnishes
a
conclusive
answer
in
the
amendment
which
was
coeval
with
the
adoption
of
the
instrument
and
which
declares
that
all
powers
not
delegated
to
the
government
of
the
union
were
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people
as
sovereignty
was
not
delegated
by
the
states
it
was
necessarily
reserved
it
would
be
superfluous
to
answer
arguments
against
implied
powers
of
the
states
none
are
claimed
by
implication
because
all
not
delegated
by
the
states
remained
with
them
and
it
was
only
in
an
abundance
of
caution
that
they
expressed
the
right
to
resume
such
parts
of
their
unlimited
power
as
was
delegated
for
the
purposes
enumerated
as
there
be
those
who
see
danger
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
in
the
possession
of
such
power
by
the
states
and
insist
that
our
fathers
did
not
intend
to
bind
the
states
together
by
a
compact
no
better
than
a
rope
of
sand
it
may
be
well
to
examine
their
position
from
what
have
dangers
to
the
union
arisen
have
they
sprang
from
too
great
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
the
granted
powers
or
from
the
assumption
by
the
general
government
of
power
claimed
by
implication
the
whole
record
of
our
union
answers
from
the
latter
only
was
this
tendency
to
usurpation
caused
by
the
presumption
of
paramount
authority
in
the
general
government
or
by
the
assertion
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
resume
the
powers
it
had
delegated
reasonably
and
honestly
it
can
not
be
assigned
to
the
latter
let
it
be
supposed
that
the
whole
people
had
recognized
the
right
of
a
state
of
the
union
peaceably
and
independently
to
resume
the
powers
which
peaceably
and
independently
she
had
delegated
to
the
federal
government
would
not
this
have
been
potent
to
restrain
the
general
government
from
exercising
its
functions
to
the
injury
and
oppression
of
such
state
to
deny
that
effect
would
be
to
suppose
that
a
dominant
majority
would
be
willing
to
drive
a
state
from
the
union
would
the
admission
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
resume
the
grants
it
had
made
have
led
to
the
exercise
of
that
right
for
light
and
trivial
causes
surely
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
nations
both
ancient
and
modern
refutes
the
supposition
in
the
language
of
the
declaration
of
independence
all
experience
hath
shown
that
mankind
are
more
disposed
to
suffer
while
evils
are
sufferable
than
to
right
themselves
by
abolishing
the
forms
to
which
they
are
accustomed
would
not
real
grievances
be
rendered
more
tolerable
by
the
consciousness
of
power
to
remove
them
and
would
not
even
imaginary
wrongs
be
embittered
by
the
manifestation
of
a
purpose
to
make
them
perpetual
to
ask
these
questions
is
to
answer
them
the
wise
and
brave
men
who
had
at
much
peril
and
great
sacrifice
secured
the
independence
of
the
states
were
as
little
disposed
to
surrender
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
as
they
were
anxious
to
organize
a
general
government
with
adequate
powers
to
remedy
the
defects
of
the
confederation
the
union
they
formed
was
not
to
destroy
the
states
but
to
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity

coercion
the
alternative
to
repudiation
of
it
by
the
constitution
and
the
fathers
of
the
constitutional
difference
between
webster
and
hamilton
the
alternative
to
secession
is
coercion
that
is
to
say
if
no
such
right
as
that
of
secession
exists
if
it
is
forbidden
or
precluded
by
the
constitution
then
it
is
a
wrong
and
by
a
well
settled
principle
of
public
law
for
every
wrong
there
must
be
a
remedy
which
in
this
case
must
be
the
application
of
force
to
the
state
attempting
to
withdraw
from
the
union
early
in
the
session
of
the
convention
which
formed
the
constitution
it
was
proposed
to
confer
upon
congress
the
power
to
call
forth
the
force
of
the
union
against
any
member
of
the
union
failing
to
fulfill
its
duty
under
the
articles
thereof
when
this
proposition
came
to
be
considered
madison
observed
that
a
union
of
the
states
containing
such
an
ingredient
seemed
to
provide
for
its
own
destruction
the
use
of
force
against
a
state
would
look
more
like
a
declaration
of
war
than
an
infliction
of
punishment
and
would
probably
be
considered
by
the
party
attacked
as
a
dissolution
of
all
previous
compacts
by
which
it
might
be
bound
he
hoped
that
such
a
system
would
be
framed
as
might
render
this
recourse
unnecessary
and
moved
that
the
clause
be
postponed
this
motion
was
adopted
and
the
proposition
was
never
again
revived
again
on
a
subsequent
occasion
speaking
of
an
appeal
to
force
madison
said
was
such
a
remedy
eligible
was
it
practicable
any
government
for
the
united
states
formed
on
the
supposed
practicability
of
using
force
against
the
unconstitutional
proceedings
of
the
states
would
prove
as
visionary
and
fallacious
as
the
government
of
congress
every
proposition
looking
in
any
way
to
the
same
or
a
similar
object
was
promptly
rejected
by
the
convention
george
mason
of
virginia
said
of
such
a
proposition
will
not
the
citizens
of
the
invaded
state
assist
one
another
until
they
rise
as
one
man
and
shake
off
the
union
altogether
oliver
ellsworth
in
the
ratifying
convention
of
connecticut
said
this
constitution
does
not
attempt
to
coerce
bodies
in
their
political
capacity
no
coercion
is
applicable
to
such
bodies
but
that
of
an
armed
force
if
we
should
attempt
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
union
by
sending
an
armed
force
against
a
delinquent
state
it
would
involve
the
good
and
bad
the
innocent
and
guilty
in
the
same
calamity
hamilton
in
the
convention
of
new
york
said
to
coerce
the
states
is
one
of
the
maddest
projects
that
was
ever
devised
what
picture
does
this
idea
present
to
our
view
a
complying
state
at
war
with
a
state
congress
marching
the
troops
of
one
state
into
the
bosom
of
another
here
is
a
nation
at
war
with
itself
can
any
reasonable
man
be
well
disposed
toward
a
government
which
makes
war
and
carnage
the
only
means
of
supporting
itself
a
government
that
can
exist
only
by
the
sword
but
can
we
believe
that
one
state
will
ever
suffer
itself
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
coercion
the
thing
is
a
dream
it
is
impossible
unhappily
our
generation
has
seen
that
in
the
decay
of
the
principles
and
feelings
which
animated
the
hearts
of
all
patriots
in
that
day
this
thing
like
many
others
then
regarded
as
impossible
dreams
has
been
only
too
feasible
and
that
states
have
permitted
themselves
to
be
used
as
instruments
not
merely
for
the
coercion
but
for
the
destruction
of
the
freedom
and
independence
of
their
sister
states
edmund
randolph
governor
of
virginia
although
the
mover
of
the
original
proposition
to
authorize
the
employment
of
the
forces
of
the
union
against
a
delinquent
member
which
had
been
so
signally
defeated
in
the
federal
convention
afterward
in
the
virginia
convention
made
an
eloquent
protest
against
the
idea
of
the
employment
of
force
against
a
state
what
species
of
military
coercion
said
he
could
the
general
government
adopt
for
the
enforcement
of
obedience
to
its
demands
either
an
army
sent
into
the
heart
of
a
delinquent
state
or
blocking
up
its
ports
have
we
lived
to
this
then
that
in
order
to
suppress
and
exclude
tyranny
it
is
necessary
to
render
the
most
affectionate
friends
the
most
bitter
enemies
set
the

against
the

and

the

slay
the

this

happy
expedient
that
is

it
not
destroy

figure

yourselves

the
dreadful

war
must

we
have
seen
already
how
vehemently
the
idea
of
even
coercion
was
repudiated
by
hamilton
marshall
and
others
the
suggestion
of
coercion
was
uniformly
treated
as
in
the
above
extracts
with
still
more
abhorrence
no
principle
was
more
fully
and
firmly
settled
on
the
highest
authority
than
that
under
our
system
there
could
be
no
coercion
of
a
state
webster
in
his
elaborate
speech
of
february
arguing
throughout
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
in
the
course
of
his
argument
sadly
confounding
the
ideas
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
federal
government
as
he
confounds
the
sovereign
people
of
the
states
with
the
state
governments
says
the
states
omit
to
appoint
senators
and
electors
it
is
not
a
matter
resting
in
state
discretion
or
state
pleasure
no
member
of
a
state
legislature
can
refuse
to
proceed
at
the
proper
time
to
elect
senators
to
congress
or
to
provide
for
the
choice
of
electors
of
president
and
any
more
than
the
members
can
refuse
when
the
appointed
day
arrives
to
meet
the
members
of
the
other
house
to
count
the
votes
for
those
officers
and
ascertain
who
are
chosen
this
was
before
the
invention
in
of
an
electoral
commission
to
relieve
congress
of
its
constitutional
duty
to
count
the
vote
hamilton
on
the
contrary
fresh
from
the
work
of
forming
the
constitution
and
familiar
with
its
principles
and
purposes
said
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
state
legislatures
by
forbearing
the
appointment
of
senators
may
destroy
the
national
government
it
is
unnecessary
to
discuss
the
particular
question
on
which
these
two
great
authorities
are
thus
directly
at
issue
i
do
not
contend
that
the
state
legislatures
of
their
own
will
have
a
right
to
forego
the
performance
of
any
federal
duty
imposed
upon
them
by
the
constitution
but
there
is
a
power
beyond
and
above
that
of
either
the
federal
or
state
governments
the
power
of
the
people
of
the
state
who
ordained
and
established
the
constitution
as
far
as
it
applies
to
themselves
reserving
as
i
think
has
been
demonstrated
the
right
to
reassume
the
grants
of
power
therein
made
when
they
deem
it
necessary
for
their
safety
or
welfare
to
do
so
at
the
behest
of
this
power
it
certainly
becomes
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
their
state
legislature
to
refrain
from
any
action
implying
adherence
to
the
union
or
partnership
from
which
the
sovereign
has
withdrawn

the
people
of

states
might

it
will
require
but
few
words
to
dispose
of
some
superficial
objections
that
have
been
made
to
the
application
of
this
doctrine
in
a
special
case
it
is
sometimes
said
that
whatever
weight
may
attach
to
principles
founded
on
the
sovereignty
and
independence
of
the
original
thirteen
states
they
can
not
apply
to
the
states
of
more
recent
origin
constituting
now
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
union
because
these
are
but
the
offspring
or
creatures
of
the
union
and
must
of
course
be
subordinate
and
dependent
this
objection
would
scarcely
occur
to
any
instructed
mind
though
it
may
possess
a
certain
degree
of
specious
plausibility
for
the
untaught
it
is
enough
to
answer
that
the
entire
equality
of
the
states
in
every
particular
is
a
vital
condition
of
their
union
every
new
member
that
has
been
admitted
into
the
partnership
of
states
came
in
as
is
expressly
declared
in
the
acts
for
their
admission
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
in
every
respect
with
the
original
members
this
equality
is
as
complete
as
the
equality
before
the
laws
of
the
son
with
the
father
immediately
on
the
attainment
by
the
former
of
his
legal
majority
without
regard
to
the
prior
condition
of
dependence
and
tutelage
the
relations
of
the
original
states
to
one
another
and
to
the
union
can
not
be
affected
by
any
subsequent
accessions
of
new
members
as
the
constitution
fixes
those
relations
permanently
and
furnishes
the
normal
standard
which
is
applicable
to
all
the
boston
memorial
to
congress
referred
to
in
a
foregoing
chapter
as
prepared
by
a
committee
with
webster
at
its
head
says
that
the
new
states
are
universally
considered
as
admitted
into
the
union
upon
the
same
footing
as
the
original
states
and
as
possessing
in
respect
to
the
union
the
same
rights
of
freedom
and
as
the
other
states
but
with
regard
to
states
formed
of
territory
acquired
by
purchase
from
france
spain
and
mexico
it
is
claimed
that
as
they
were
bought
by
the
united
states
they
belong
to
the
same
and
have
no
right
to
withdraw
at
will
from
an
association
the
property
which
had
been
purchased
by
the
other
parties
happy
would
it
have
been
if
the
equal
rights
of
the
people
of
the
states
to
the
enjoyment
of
territory
acquired
by
the
common
treasure
could
have
been
recognized
at
the
proper
time
there
would
then
have
been
no
secession
and
no
war
as
for
the
sordid
claim
of
ownership
of
states
on
account
of
the
money
spent
for
the
land
which
they
contain
i
can
understand
the
ground
of
a
claim
to
some
interest
in
the
soil
so
long
as
it
continues
to
be
public
property
but
have
yet
to
learn
in
what
way
the
united
states
ever
became
purchaser
of
the
or
of
their
political
rights
any
question
in
regard
to
property
has
always
been
admitted
to
be
matter
for
fair
and
equitable
settlement
in
case
of
the
withdrawal
of
a
state
the
treaty
by
which
the
louisiana
territory
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
expressly
provided
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
should
be
admitted
as
soon
as
possible
according
to
the
principles
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
rights
advantages
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
all
other
acquisitions
of
territory
the
same
stipulation
is
either
expressed
or
implied
indeed
the
denial
of
the
right
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
american
political
institutions
another
objection
made
to
the
right
of
secession
is
based
upon
obscure
indefinite
and
inconsistent
ideas
with
regard
to
it
assumes
various
shapes
and
is
therefore
somewhat
difficult
to
meet
but
as
most
frequently
presented
may
be
stated
thus
that
the
citizen
owes
a
double
allegiance
or
a
divided
allegiance
partly
to
his
state
partly
to
the
united
states
that
it
is
not
possible
for
either
of
these
powers
to
release
him
from
the
allegiance
due
to
the
other
that
the
state
can
no
more
release
him
from
his
obligations
to
the
union
than
the
united
states
can
absolve
him
from
his
duties
to
his
state
this
is
the
most
moderate
way
in
which
the
objection
is
put
the
extreme
centralizers
go
further
and
claim
that
allegiance
to
the
union
or
as
they
generally
express
it
to
meaning
thereby
the
federal
government
is
paramount
and
the
obligation
to
the
state
only
subsidiary
if
indeed
it
exists
at
all
this
latter
view
if
the
more
monstrous
is
at
least
the
more
consistent
of
the
two
for
it
does
not
involve
the
difficulty
of
a
divided
allegiance
nor
the
paradoxical
position
in
which
the
other
places
the
citizen
in
case
of
a
conflict
between
his
state
and
the
other
members
of
the
union
of
being
necessarily
a
rebel
against
the
general
government
or
a
traitor
to
the
state
of
which
he
is
a
citizen
as
to
allegiance
in
the
light
of
the
principles
which
have
been
established
there
can
be
no
doubt
with
regard
to
it
the
primary
paramount
allegiance
of
the
citizen
is
due
to
the
sovereign
only
that
sovereign
under
our
system
is
the
people
the
people
of
the
state
to
which
he
belongs
the
people
who
constituted
the
state
government
which
he
obeys
and
which
protects
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
personal
rights
the
people
who
alone
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
ordained
and
established
the
federal
constitution
and
federal
government
the
people
who
have
reserved
to
themselves
sovereignty
which
involves
the
power
to
revoke
all
agencies
created
by
them
the
obligation
to
support
the
state
or
federal
constitution
and
the
obedience
due
to
either
state
or
federal
government
are
alike
derived
from
and
dependent
on
the
allegiance
due
to
this
sovereign
if
the
sovereign
abolishes
the
state
government
and
ordains
and
establishes
a
new
one
the
obligation
of
allegiance
requires
him
to
transfer
his
obedience
accordingly
if
the
sovereign
withdraws
from
association
with
its
confederates
in
the
union
the
allegiance
of
the
citizen
requires
him
to
follow
the
sovereign
any
other
course
is
rebellion
or
treason
words
which
in
the
cant
of
the
day
have
been
so
grossly
misapplied
and
perverted
as
to
be
made
worse
than
unmeaning
his
relation
to
the
union
arose
from
the
membership
of
the
state
of
which
he
was
a
citizen
and
ceased
whenever
his
state
withdrew
from
it
he
can
not
owe
obedience
much
less
allegiance
to
an
association
from
which
his
sovereign
has
separated
and
thereby
withdrawn
him
every
officer
of
both
federal
and
state
governments
is
required
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
a
compact
the
binding
force
of
which
is
based
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
a
sovereignty
necessarily
carrying
with
it
the
principles
just
stated
with
regard
to
allegiance
every
such
officer
is
therefore
virtually
sworn
to
maintain
and
support
the
sovereignty
of
all
the
states
military
and
naval
officers
take
in
addition
an
oath
to
obey
the
lawful
orders
of
their
superiors
such
an
oath
has
never
been
understood
to
be
eternal
in
its
obligations
it
is
dissolved
by
the
death
dismissal
or
resignation
of
the
officer
who
takes
it
and
such
resignation
is
not
a
mere
optional
right
but
becomes
an
imperative
duty
when
continuance
in
the
service
comes
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
ultimate
allegiance
due
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
to
which
he
belongs
a
little
consideration
of
these
plain
and
irrefutable
truths
would
show
how
utterly
unworthy
and
false
are
the
vulgar
taunts
which
attribute
treason
to
those
who
in
the
late
secession
of
the
southern
states
were
loyal
to
the
only
sovereign
entitled
to
their
allegiance
and
which
still
more
absurdly
prate
of
the
violation
of
oaths
to
support
an
oath
which
nobody
ever
could
have
been
legally
required
to
take
and
which
must
have
been
ignorantly
confounded
with
the
prescribed
oath
to
support
the
constitution
nullification
and
secession
are
often
erroneously
treated
as
if
they
were
one
and
the
same
thing
it
is
true
that
both
ideas
spring
from
the
sovereign
right
of
a
state
to
interpose
for
the
protection
of
its
own
people
but
they
are
altogether
unlike
as
to
both
their
extent
and
the
character
of
the
means
to
be
employed
the
first
was
a
temporary
expedient
intended
to
restrain
action
until
the
question
at
issue
could
be
submitted
to
a
convention
of
the
states
it
was
a
remedy
which
its
supporters
sought
to
apply
within
the
union
a
means
to
avoid
the
last
resort
separation
if
the
application
for
a
convention
should
fail
or
if
the
state
making
it
should
suffer
an
adverse
decision
the
advocates
of
that
remedy
have
not
revealed
what
they
proposed
as
the
next
step
supposing
the
infraction
of
the
compact
to
have
been
of
that
character
which
according
to
webster
dissolved
it
secession
on
the
other
hand
was
the
assertion
of
the
inalienable
right
of
a
people
to
change
their
government
whenever
it
ceased
to
fulfill
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
ordained
and
established
under
our
form
of
government
and
the
cardinal
principles
upon
which
it
was
founded
it
should
have
been
a
peaceful
remedy
the
withdrawal
of
a
state
from
a
league
has
no
revolutionary
or
insurrectionary
characteristic
the
government
of
the
state
remains
unchanged
as
to
all
internal
affairs
it
is
only
its
external
or
confederate
relations
that
are
altered
to
term
this
action
of
a
sovereign
a
rebellion
is
a
gross
abuse
of
language
so
is
the
flippant
phrase
which
speaks
of
it
as
an
appeal
to
the
arbitrament
of
the
sword
in
the
late
contest
in
particular
there
was
no
appeal
by
the
seceding
states
to
the
arbitrament
of
arms
there
was
on
their
part
no
invitation
nor
provocation
to
war
they
stood
in
an
attitude
of
and
were
attacked
for
merely
exercising
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
original
terms
of
the
compact
they
neither
tendered
nor
accepted
any
challenge
to
the
wager
of
battle
the
man
who
defends
his
house
against
attack
can
not
with
any
propriety
be
said
to
have
submitted
the
question
of
his
right
to
it
to
the
arbitrament
of
arms
two
moral
obligations
or
restrictions
upon
a
seceding
state
certainly
exist
in
the
first
place
not
to
break
up
the
partnership
without
good
and
sufficient
cause
and
in
the
second
to
make
an
equitable
settlement
with
former
associates
and
as
far
as
may
be
to
avoid
the
infliction
of
loss
or
damage
upon
any
of
them
neither
of
these
obligations
was
violated
or
neglected

the
southern
states

their

by

of

statesmen
that
a
danger
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
would
arise
from
the
conflicting
interests
of
different
sections
and
every
effort
was
made
to
secure
each
of
these
classes
of
interests
against
aggression
by
the
other
as
a
proof
of
this
may
be
cited
the
following
extract
from
madison
report
of
a
speech
made
by
himself
in
the
philadelphia
convention
on
the
of
june
he
admitted
that
every
peculiar
interest
whether
in
any
class
of
citizens
or
any
description
of
states
ought
to
be
secured
as
far
as
possible
wherever
there
is
danger
of
attack
there
ought
to
be
given
a
constitutional
power
of
defense
but
he
contended
that
the
states
were
divided
into
different
interests
not
by
their
difference
of
size
but
by
other
circumstances
the
most
material
of
which
resulted
from
climate
but
principally
from
the
effects
of
their
having
or
not
having
slaves
these
two
causes
concurred
in
forming
the
great
division
of
interests
in
the
united
states
it
did
not
lie
between
the
large
and
small
states
it
lay
between
the
northern
and
southern
and
if
any
defensive
power
were
necessary
it
ought
to
be
mutually
given
to
these
two
interests
rufus
king
a
distinguished
member
of
the
convention
from
massachusetts
a
few
days
afterward
said
to
the
same
effect
he
was
fully
convinced
that
the
question
concerning
a
difference
of
interests
did
not
lie
where
it
had
hitherto
been
discussed
between
the
great
and
small
states
but
between
the
southern
and
eastern
for
this
reason
he
had
been
ready
to
yield
something
in
the
proportion
of
representatives
for
the
security
of
the
southern
he
was
not
averse
to
giving
them
a
still
greater
security
but
did
not
see
how
it
could
be
done
the
wise
men
who
formed
the
constitution
were
not
seeking
to
bind
the
states
together
by
the
material
power
of
a
majority
nor
were
they
so
blind
to
the
influences
of
passion
and
interest
as
to
believe
that
paper
barriers
would
suffice
to
restrain
a
majority
actuated
by
either
or
both
of
these
motives
they
endeavored
therefore
to
prevent
the
conflicts
inevitable
from
the
ascendancy
of
a
sectional
or
party
majority
by
so
distributing
the
powers
of
government
that
each
interest
might
hold
a
check
upon
the
other
it
was
believed
that
the
compromises
made
with
regard
to
representation
securing
to
each
state
an
equal
vote
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
of
representatives
giving
the
states
a
weight
in
proportion
to
their
respective
population
estimating
the
negroes
as
equivalent
to
three
fifths
of
the
same
number
of
free
whites
would
have
the
effect
of
giving
at
an
early
period
a
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
the
south
while
the
north
would
retain
the
ascendancy
in
the
senate
thus
it
was
supposed
that
the
two
great
sectional
interests
would
be
enabled
to
restrain
each
other
within
the
limits
of
purposes
and
action
beneficial
to
both
the
failure
of
these
expectations
need
not
affect
our
reverence
for
the
intentions
of
the
fathers
or
our
respect
for
the
means
which
they
devised
to
carry
them
into
effect
that
they
were
mistaken
both
as
to
the
maintenance
of
the
balance
of
sectional
power
and
as
to
the
fidelity
and
integrity
with
which
the
congress
was
expected
to
conform
to
the
letter
and
spirit
of
its
delegated
authority
is
perhaps
to
be
ascribed
less
to
lack
of
prophetic
foresight
than
to
that
confidence
which
is
the
weakness
of
honest
minds
and
which
was
naturally
strengthened
by
the
patriotic
and
fraternal
feelings
resulting
from
the
great
struggle
through
which
they
had
then
but
recently
passed
they
saw
in
the
sufficiency
of
the
authority
delegated
to
the
federal
government
and
in
the
fullness
of
the
sovereignty
retained
by
the
states
a
system
the
strict
construction
of
which
was
so
eminently
adapted
to
indefinite
expansion
of
the
confederacy
as
to
embrace
every
variety
of
production
and
consequent
diversity
of
pursuit
carried
out
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
devised
there
was
in
this
system
no
element
of
disintegration
but
every
facility
for
an
enlargement
of
the
circle
of
the
family
of
states
or
nations
so
that
it
scarcely
seemed
unreasonable
to
look
forward
to
a
fulfillment
of
the
aspiration
of
hamilton
that
it
might
extend
over
north
america
perhaps
over
the
whole
continent
not
at
all
incompatible
with
these
views
and
purposes
was
the
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
states
to
reassume
if
occasion
should
require
it
the
powers
which
they
had
delegated
on
the
contrary
the
maintenance
of
this
right
was
the
surest
guarantee
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
and
the
denial
of
it
sounded
the
first
serious
note
of
its
dissolution
the
conservative
efficiency
of
for
maintenance
of
the
essential
principles
of
the
union
against
aggression
or
decadence
is
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
features
in
the
debates
of
the
various
state
conventions
by
which
the
constitution
was
ratified
perhaps
their
ideas
of
the
particular
form
in
which
this
interposition
was
to
be
made
may
have
been
somewhat
indefinite
and
left
to
be
reduced
to
shape
by
the
circumstances
when
they
should
arise
but
the
principle
itself
was
assumed
and
asserted
as
fundamental
but
for
a
firm
reliance
upon
it
as
a
sure
resort
in
case
of
need
it
may
safely
be
said
that
the
union
would
never
have
been
formed
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
wisdom
and
sagacity
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
suppose
that
they
entirely
relied
on
paper
barriers
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
minorities
fresh
from
the
defense
of
violated
charters
and
faithless
aggression
on
inalienable
rights
it
might
be
assumed
that
they
would
require
something
more
potential
than
mere
promises
to
protect
them
from
human
depravity
and
human
ambition
that
they
did
so
is
to
be
found
in
the
debates
both
of
the
general
and
the
state
conventions
where
state
interposition
was
often
declared
to
be
the
bulwark
against
usurpation
at
an
early
period
in
the
history
of
the
federal
government
the
states
of
kentucky
and
virginia
found
reason
to
reassert
this
right
of
state
interposition
in
the
first
of
the
famous
resolutions
drawn
by
jefferson
in
and
with
some
modification
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
kentucky
in
november
of
that
year
it
is
declared
that
whensoever
the
general
government
assumes
undelegated
powers
its
acts
are
void
and
of
no
that
to
this
compact
each
state
acceded
as
a
state
and
is
an
integral
party
that
this
government
created
by
this
compact
was
not
made
the
exclusive
or
final
judge
of
the
extent
of
the
powers
delegated
to
itself
since
that
would
have
made
its
discretion
and
not
the
constitution
the
measure
of
its
powers
but
that
as
in
all
other
cases
of
compact
among
parties
having
no
common
judge
party
has
an
equal
right
to
judge
for
itself
as
well
of
infractions
as
of
the
mode
and
measure
of
in
the
virginia
resolutions
drawn
by
madison
adopted
on
the
of
december
and
reaffirmed
in
the
general
assembly
of
that
state
declares
that
it
views
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
as
resulting
from
the
compact
to
which
the
states
are
parties
as
limited
by
the
plain
sense
and
intention
of
the
instrument
constituting
that
compact
as
no
further
valid
than
they
are
authorized
by
the
grants
enumerated
in
that
compact
and
that
in
case
of
a
deliberate
palpable
and
dangerous
exercise
of
other
powers
not
granted
by
the
said
compact
the
states
who
are
parties
thereto
have
the
right
and
are
in
duty
bound
to
interpose
for
arresting
the
progress
of
the
evil
and
for
maintaining
within
their
respective
limits
the
authorities
rights
and
liberties
appertaining
to
them
another
of
the
same
series
of
resolutions
denounces
the
indications
of
a
design
to
consolidate
the
states
by
degrees
into
one
sovereignty
these
it
is
true
were
only
the
resolves
of
two
states
and
they
were
dissented
from
by
several
other
state
legislatures
not
so
much
on
the
ground
of
opposition
to
the
general
principles
asserted
as
on
that
of
their
being
unnecessary
in
their
application
to
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
which
were
the
immediate
occasion
of
their
utterance
nevertheless
they
were
the
basis
of
the
contest
for
the
presidency
in
which
resulted
in
their
approval
by
the
people
in
the
triumphant
election
of
jefferson
they
became
part
of
the
accepted
creed
of
the
republican
democratic
or
conservative
party
as
it
has
been
variously
termed
at
different
periods
and
as
such
they
were
ratified
by
the
people
in
every
presidential
election
that
took
place
for
sixty
years
with
two
exceptions
the
last
victory
obtained
under
them
and
when
they
were
emphasized
by
adding
the
construction
of
them
contained
in
the
report
of
madison
to
the
virginia
legislature
in
was
at
the
election
of
buchanan
the
last
president
chosen
by
vote
of
a
party
that
could
with
any
propriety
be
styled
national
in
contradistinction
to
sectional
at
a
critical
and
memorable
period
that
pure
spirit
luminous
intellect
and
devoted
adherent
of
the
constitution
the
great
statesman
of
south
carolina
invoked
this
remedy
of
state
interposition
against
the
tariff
act
of
which
was
deemed
injurious
and
oppressive
to
his
state
no
purpose
was
then
declared
to
coerce
the
state
as
such
but
measures
were
taken
to
break
the
protective
shield
of
her
authority
and
enforce
the
laws
of
congress
upon
her
citizens
by
compelling
them
to
pay
outside
of
her
ports
the
duties
on
imports
which
the
state
had
declared
unconstitutional
and
had
forbidden
to
be
collected
in
her
ports
there
remained
at
that
day
enough
of
the
spirit
in
which
the
union
had
been
founded
enough
of
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
states
and
of
regard
for
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
to
prevent
a
conflict
of
arms
the
compromise
of
was
adopted
which
south
carolina
agreed
to
accept
the
principle
for
which
she
contended
being
virtually
conceded
meantime
there
had
been
no
lack
as
we
have
already
seen
of
assertions
of
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
states
from
other
quarters
the
declaration
of
these
rights
by
the
new
england
states
and
their
representatives
on
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
in
on
the
admission
of
the
state
of
that
name
in
and
on
the
question
of
the
annexation
of
texas
in
have
been
referred
to
in
another
place
among
the
resolutions
of
the
massachusetts
legislature
in
relation
to
the
proposed
annexation
of
texas
adopted
in
february
were
the
following
that
there
has
hitherto
been
no
precedent
of
the
admission
of
a
foreign
state
or
foreign
territory
into
the
union
by
legislation
and
as
the
powers
of
legislation
granted
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
congress
do
not
embrace
a
case
of
the
admission
of
a
foreign
state
or
foreign
territory
by
legislation
into
the
union
such
an
act
of
admission
have
no
binding
force
whatever
on
the
people
of
that
the
power
having
been
granted
by
the
people
of
to
admit
into
the
union
states
and
territories
not
within
the
same
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
with
the
people
and
can
only
be
exercised
in
such
way
and
manner
as
the
people
shall
hereafter
designate
and
to
these
stanch
declarations
of
principles
with
regard
to
which
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
particular
occasion
that
called
them
forth
my
only
doubt
would
be
whether
they
do
not
express
too
decided
a
doctrine
of
nullification
may
be
added
the
avowal
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
sons
of
massachusetts
john
quincy
adams
in
his
discourse
before
the
new
york
historical
society
in
nations
says
adams
acknowledge
no
judge
between
them
upon
earth
and
their
governments
from
necessity
must
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
decide
when
the
failure
of
one
party
to
a
contract
to
perform
its
obligations
absolves
the
other
from
the
reciprocal
fulfillment
of
its
own
but
this
last
of
earthly
powers
is
not
necessary
to
the
freedom
or
independence
of
states
connected
together
by
the
immediate
action
of
the
people
of
whom
they
consist
to
the
people
alone
is
there
reserved
as
well
the
dissolving
as
the
constituent
power
and
that
power
can
be
exercised
by
them
only
under
the
tie
of
conscience
binding
them
to
the
retributive
justice
of
heaven
with
these
qualifications
we
may
admit
the
same
right
as
vested
in
the
of
every
in
the
union
with
reference
to
the
general
government
which
was
exercised
by
the
people
of
the
united
colonies
with
reference
to
the
supreme
head
of
the
british
empire
of
which
they
formed
a
part
and
under
these
limitations
have
the
people
of
each
state
in
the
union
a
right
to
secede
from
the
confederated
union
itself
thus
stands
the
right
but
the
indissoluble
link
of
union
between
the
people
of
the
several
states
of
this
confederated
nation
is
after
all
not
in
the
right
but
in
the
heart
if
the
day
should
ever
come
may
heaven
avert
it
when
the
affections
of
the
people
of
these
states
shall
be
alienated
from
each
other
when
the
fraternal
spirit
shall
give
way
to
cold
indifference
or
collision
of
interests
shall
fester
into
hatred
the
bonds
of
political
association
will
not
long
hold
together
parties
no
longer
attracted
by
the
magnetism
of
conciliated
interests
and
kindly
sympathies
and
better
will
it
be
for
the
people
of
the
disunited
states
to
part
in
friendship
with
each
other
than
to
be
held
together
by
then
will
be
the
time
for
reverting
to
the
precedents
which
occurred
at
the
formation
and
adoption
of
the
constitution
to
form
again
a
perfect
union
by
dissolving
that
which
could
no
longer
and
to
leave
the
separated
parts
to
be
reunited
by
the
law
of
political
gravitation
to
the
center
perhaps
it
is
unfortunate
that
in
earlier
and
better
times
when
the
prospect
of
serious
difficulties
first
arose
a
convention
of
the
states
was
not
assembled
to
consider
the
relations
of
the
various
states
and
the
government
of
the
union
as
time
rolled
on
the
general
government
gathering
with
both
hands
a
mass
of
undelegated
powers
reached
that
position
which
jefferson
had
pointed
out
as
an
intolerable
evil
the
claim
of
a
right
to
judge
of
the
extent
of
its
own
authority
of
those
then
participating
in
public
affairs
it
was
apparently
useless
to
ask
that
the
question
should
be
submitted
for
decision
to
the
parties
to
the
compact
under
the
same
conditions
as
those
which
controlled
the
formation
and
adoption
of
the
constitution
otherwise
a
convention
would
have
been
utterly
fruitless
for
at
that
period
when
aggression
for
sectional
aggrandizement
had
made
such
rapid
advances
it
can
scarcely
be
doubted
that
more
than
a
fourth
if
not
a
majority
of
states
would
have
adhered
to
that
policy
which
had
been
manifested
for
years
in
the
legislation
of
many
states
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
federal
government
what
course
would
then
have
remained
to
the
southern
states
nothing
except
either
to
submit
to
a
continuation
of
what
they
believed
and
felt
to
be
violations
of
the
compact
of
union
breaches
of
faith
injurious
and
oppressive
usurpation
or
else
to
assert
the
sovereign
right
to
reassume
the
grants
they
had
made
since
those
grants
had
been
perverted
from
their
original
and
proper
purposes
surely
the
right
to
resume
the
powers
delegated
and
to
judge
of
the
propriety
and
sufficiency
of
the
causes
for
doing
so
are
alike
inseparable
from
the
possession
of
sovereignty
over
sovereigns
there
is
no
common
judge
and
between
them
can
be
no
umpire
except
by
their
own
agreement
and
consent
the
necessity
or
propriety
of
exercising
the
right
to
withdraw
from
a
confederacy
or
union
must
be
determined
by
each
member
for
itself
once
determined
in
favor
of
withdrawal
all
that
remains
for
consideration
is
the
obligation
to
see
that
no
wanton
damage
is
done
to
former
associates
and
to
make
such
fair
settlement
of
common
interests

a
bond
of
union
necessary
after
the
declaration
of
articles
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
the
same
principle
for
obtaining
grants
of
power
in
the
constitution
an
instrument
enumerating
the
powers
the
power
of
amendment
merely
a
power
to
amend
the
delegated
a
smaller
power
was
required
for
amendment
than
for
a
the
power
of
amendment
is
confined
to
grants
of
the
limitations
on
the
power
of
amendment
in
july
the
congress
of
the
thirteen
united
colonies
declared
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states
the
denial
of
this
asserted
right
and
the
attempted
coercion
made
it
manifest
that
a
bond
of
union
was
necessary
for
the
common
defense
in
november
of
the
next
year
articles
of
confederation
and
perpetual
union
were
entered
into
by
the
thirteen
states
under
the
style
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
government
instituted
was
to
be
administered
by
a
congress
of
delegates
from
the
several
states
and
each
state
to
have
an
equal
voice
in
legislation
the
government
so
formed
was
to
act
through
and
by
the
states
and
having
no
power
to
enforce
its
requisitions
upon
the
states
embarrassment
was
early
realized
in
its
efforts
to
provide
for
the
exigencies
of
war
after
the
treaty
of
peace
and
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
states
the
difficulty
of
raising
revenue
and
regulating
commerce
was
so
great
as
to
lead
to
repeated
efforts
to
obtain
from
the
states
additional
grants
of
power
under
the
articles
of
confederation
no
amendment
of
them
could
be
made
except
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
states
and
this
it
had
not
been
found
possible
to
obtain
for
the
powers
requisite
to
the
efficient
discharge
of
the
functions
intrusted
to
the
congress
hence
arose
the
proceedings
for
a
convention
to
amend
the
articles
of
confederation
the
result
was
the
formation
of
a
new
plan
of
government
entitled
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
this
was
submitted
to
the
congress
in
order
that
if
approved
by
them
it
might
be
referred
to
the
states
for
adoption
or
rejection
by
the
several
conventions
thereof
and
if
adopted
by
nine
of
the
states
it
was
to
be
the
compact
of
union
between
the
states
so
ratifying
the
same
the
new
form
of
government
differed
in
many
essential
particulars
from
the
old
one
the
delegates
intent
on
the
purpose
to
give
greater
efficiency
to
the
government
of
the
union
proposed
greatly
to
enlarge
its
powers
so
much
so
that
it
was
not
deemed
safe
to
confide
them
to
a
single
body
and
they
were
consequently
distributed
between
three
independent
departments
of
government
which
might
be
a
check
upon
one
another
the
constitution
did
not
like
the
articles
of
confederation
declare
that
the
states
had
agreed
to
a
perpetual
union
but
distinctly
indicated
the
hope
of
its
perpetuity
by
the
expression
in
the
preamble
of
the
purpose
to
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
the
circumstances
under
which
the
union
of
the
constitution
was
formed
justified
the
hope
of
its
perpetuity
but
the
brief
existence
of
the
confederation
may
have
been
a
warning
against
the
renewal
of
the
assertion
that
the
compact
should
be
perpetual
a
remedy
for
the
embarrassment
which
had
been
realized
under
the
articles
of
confederation
in
obtaining
amendments
to
correct
any
defects
in
grants
of
power
so
as
to
render
them
effective
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
given
was
provided
by
its
fifth
article
it
is
here
to
be
specially
noted
that
new
grants
of
power
as
asked
for
by
the
convention
were
under
the
articles
of
confederation
only
to
be
obtained
from
the
unanimous
assent
of
the
states
therefore
it
followed
that
two
of
the
states
which
did
not
ratify
the
constitution
were
so
long
as
they
retained
that
attitude
free
from
its
obligations
thus
it
is
seen
that
the
same
principle
in
regard
to
obtaining
grants
of
additional
power
for
the
federal
government
formed
the
rule
for
the
union
as
it
had
done
for
the
confederation
that
is
that
the
consent
of
each
and
every
state
was
a
prerequisite
the
apprehension
which
justly
existed
that
several
of
the
states
might
reject
the
constitution
and
under
the
rule
of
unanimity
defeat
it
led
to
the
seventh
article
of
the
constitution
which
provided
that
the
ratification
by
the
conventions
of
nine
states
should
be
sufficient
for
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
between
the
states
ratifying
it
which
of
course
contemplated
leaving
the
others
more
or
less
in
number
separate
and
distinct
from
the
nine
states
forming
a
new
government
thus
was
the
union
to
be
a
voluntary
compact
and
all
the
powers
of
its
government
to
be
derived
from
the
assent
of
each
of
its
members
these
powers
as
proposed
by
the
constitution
were
so
extensive
as
to
create
alarm
and
opposition
by
some
of
the
most
influential
men
in
many
of
the
states
it
is
known
that
the
objection
of
the
patriot
samuel
adams
was
only
overcome
by
an
assurance
that
such
an
amendment
as
the
tenth
would
be
adopted
like
opposition
was
by
like
assurance
elsewhere
overcome
that
article
is
in
these
words
the
powers
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
nor
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
amendment
however
of
the
delegated
powers
was
made
more
easy
than
it
had
been
under
the
confederation
ratification
by
three
fourths
of
the
states
was
sufficient
under
the
constitution
for
the
adoption
of
an
amendment
to
it
as
this
power
of
amendment
threatens
to
be
the
rod
which
will
swallow
up
the
rest
i
propose
to
give
it
special
examination
what
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
whole
body
of
the
instrument
the
history
of
its
formation
and
adoption
as
well
as
the
tenth
amendment
added
in
an
abundance
of
caution
clearly
show
it
to
be
an
instrument
enumerating
the
powers
delegated
by
the
states
to
the
federal
government
their
common
agent
it
is
specifically
declared
that
all
which
was
not
so
delegated
was
reserved
on
this
mass
of
reserved
powers
those
which
the
states
declined
to
grant
the
federal
government
was
expressly
forbidden
to
intrude
of
what
value
would
this
prohibition
have
been
if
three
fourths
of
the
states
could
without
the
assent
of
a
particular
state
invade
the
domain
which
that
state
had
reserved
for
its
own
exclusive
use
and
control
it
has
heretofore
i
hope
been
satisfactorily
demonstrated
that
the
states
were
sovereigns
before
they
formed
the
union
and
that
they
have
never
surrendered
their
sovereignty
but
have
only
intrusted
by
their
common
agent
certain
functions
of
sovereignty
to
be
used
for
their
common
welfare
among
the
powers
delegated
was
one
to
amend
the
constitution
which
it
is
submitted
was
merely
the
power
to
amend
the
delegated
grants
and
these
were
obtained
by
the
separate
and
independent
action
of
each
state
acceding
to
the
union
when
we
consider
how
carefully
each
clause
was
discussed
in
the
general
convention
and
how
closely
each
was
scrutinized
in
the
conventions
of
the
several
states
the
conclusion
can
not
be
avoided
that
all
was
specified
which
it
was
intended
to
bestow
and
not
a
few
of
the
wisest
in
that
day
held
that
too
much
power
had
been
conferred
aware
of
the
imperfection
of
everything
devised
by
man
it
was
foreseen
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
functions
intrusted
to
the
general
government
experience
might
reveal
the
necessity
of
modification
amendment
and
power
was
therefore
given
to
amend
in
a
certain
manner
the
delegated
trusts
so
as
to
make
them
efficient
for
the
purposes
designed
or
to
prevent
their
misconstruction
or
abuse
to
the
injury
or
oppression
of
any
of
the
people
in
support
of
this
view
i
refer
to
the
historical
fact
that
the
first
ten
amendments
of
the
constitution
nearly
coeval
with
it
all
refer
either
to
the
powers
delegated
or
are
directed
to
the
greater
security
of
the
rights
which
were
guarded
by
express
limitations
the
distinction
in
the
mind
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
between
amendment
and
delegation
of
power
seems
to
me
clearly
drawn
by
the
fact
that
the
constitution
itself
which
was
a
proposition
to
the
states
to
grant
enumerated
powers
was
only
to
have
effect
between
the
ratifying
states
but
the
fifth
article
provided
that
amendments
to
the
constitution
might
be
adopted
by
three
fourths
of
the
states
and
thereby
be
valid
as
part
of
the
constitution
it
thus
appears
that
a
smaller
power
was
required
for
an
amendment
than
for
a
grant
and
the
natural
if
not
necessary
conclusion
is
that
it
was
because
an
amendment
must
belong
to
and
grow
out
of
a
grant
previously
made
if
a
amendment
could
have
been
the
means
of
obtaining
a
new
power
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
those
watchful
guardians
of
community
independence
for
which
the
war
of
the
revolution
had
been
fought
would
have
been
reconciled
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
by
the
declaration
that
the
powers
not
delegated
are
reserved
to
the
states
unless
the
power
of
amendment
be
confined
to
the
grants
of
the
constitution
there
can
be
no
security
to
the
reserved
rights
of
a
minority
less
than
a
fourth
of
the
states
i
submit
that
the
word
amendment
necessarily
implies
an
improvement
upon
something
which
is
possessed
and
can
have
no
proper
application
to
that
which
did
not
previously
exist
the
apprehension
that
was
felt
of
this
power
of
amendment
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
is
shown
by
the
restrictions
placed
upon
the
exercise
of
several
of
the
delegated
powers
for
example
power
was
given
to
admit
new
states
but
no
new
state
should
be
erected
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
other
state
nor
be
formed
by
the
junction
of
two
or
more
states
or
parts
of
states
without
the
consent
of
the
legislatures
of
those
states
and
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
was
limited
by
the
prohibition
of
an
amendment
affecting
for
a
certain
time
the
migration
or
importation
of
persons
whom
any
of
the
existing
states
should
think
proper
to
admit
and
by
the
very
important
provision
for
the
protection
of
the
smaller
states
and
the
preservation
of
their
equality
in
the
union
that
the
compact
in
regard
to
the
membership
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
should
not
be
so
amended
that
any
state
without
its
consent
shall
be
deprived
of
its
equal
suffrage
in
the
senate
these
limitations
and
prohibitions
on
the
power
of
amendment
all
refer
to
clauses
of
the
constitution
to
things
which
existed
as
part
of
the
general
government
they
were
not
needed
and
therefore
not
to
be
found
in
relation
to
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
on
which
the
general
government
was
forbidden
to
intrude
by
the
ninth
article
of
the
amendments
in
view
of
the
small
territory
of
the
new
england
states
comparatively
to
that
of
the
middle
and
southern
states
and
the
probability
of
the
creation
of
new
states
in
the
large
territory
of
some
of
these
latter
it
might
well
have
been
anticipated
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
new
england
states
would
become
less
than
one
fourth
of
the
members
of
the
union
nothing
is
less
likely
than
that
the
watchful
patriots
of
that
region
would
have
consented
to
a
form
of
government
which
should
give
to
a
majority
of
three
fourths
of
the
states
the
power
to
deprive
them
of
their
dearest
rights
and
privileges
yet
to
this
extremity
the
theory
of
the
power
of
amendment
would
go
against
this
insidious
assault
this
wooden
horse
which
it
is
threatened
to
introduce
into
the
citadel
of
our
liberties
i
have
sought
to
warn
the

of

from

with

of

of

to
come
to
any
agreement
the
last
reasonable
hope
of
a
pacific
settlement
of
difficulties
within
the
union
was
extinguished
in
the
minds
of
those
most
reluctant
to
abandon
the
effort
the
year
opened
as
we
have
seen
upon
the
spectacle
of
a
general
belief
among
the
people
of
the
planting
states
in
the
necessity
of
an
early
secession
as
the
only
possible
alternative
left
them
it
has
already
been
shown
that
the
calmness
and
deliberation
with
which
the
measures
requisite
for
withdrawal
were
adopted
and
executed
afford
the
best
refutation
of
the
charge
that
they
were
the
result
of
haste
passion
or
precipitation
still
more
contrary
to
truth
is
the
assertion
so
often
recklessly
made
and
reiterated
that
the
people
of
the
south
were
led
into
secession
against
their
will
and
their
better
judgment
by
a
few
ambitious
and
discontented
politicians
the
truth
is
that
the
southern
people
were
in
advance
of
their
representatives
throughout
and
that
these
latter
were
not
agitators
or
leaders
in
the
popular
movement
they
were
in
harmony
with
its
great
principles
but
their
influence
with
very
few
exceptions
was
exerted
to
restrain
rather
than
to
accelerate
their
application
and
to
allay
rather
than
to
stimulate
excitement
as
sentinels
on
the
outer
wall
the
people
had
a
right
to
look
to
them
for
warning
of
approaching
danger
but
as
we
have
seen
in
that
last
session
of
the
last
congress
that
preceded
the
disruption
southern
senators
of
the
class
generally
considered
extremists
served
on
a
committee
of
pacification
and
strove
earnestly
to
promote
its
objects
failing
in
this
they
still
exerted
themselves
to
prevent
the
commission
of
any
act
that
might
result
in
bloodshed
invention
has
busied
itself
to
the
exhaustion
of
its
resources
in
the
creation
of
imaginary
cabals
conspiracies
and
intrigues
among
the
senators
and
representatives
of
the
south
on
duty
in
washington
at
that
time
the
idle
gossip
of
the
public
hotels
the
sensational
rumors
of
the
streets
the
of
newspaper
correspondents
whatever
was
floating
through
the
atmosphere
of
that
anxious
period
however
lightly
regarded
at
the
moment
by
the
more
intelligent
has
since
been
drawn
upon
for
materials
to
be
used
in
the
construction
of
what
has
been
widely
accepted
as
authentic
history
nothing
would
seem
to
be
too
absurd
for
such
uses
thus
it
has
been
gravely
stated
that
a
caucus
of
southern
senators
held
in
the
early
part
of
january
resolved
to
assume
to
themselves
the
political
power
of
the
south
that
they
took
entire
control
of
all
political
and
military
operations
that
they
issued
instructions
for
the
passage
of
ordinances
of
secession
and
for
the
seizure
of
forts
arsenals
and
with
much
more
of
the
like
groundless
fiction
a
foreign
prince
who
served
for
a
time
in
the
federal
army
and
has
since
undertaken
to
write
a
history
of
the
civil
war
in
america
a
history
the
incomparable
blunders
of
which
are
redeemed
from
suspicion
of
willful
misstatement
only
by
the
ignorance
of
the
subject
speaks
of
the
southern
representatives
as
having
kept
their
seats
in
congress
in
order
to
be
able
to
paralyze
its
action
forming
at
the
same
time
a
center
whence
they
issued
directions
to
their
friends
in
the
south
to
complete
the
dismemberment
of
the
republic
and
again
with
reference
to
the
secession
of
several
states
he
says
that
the
word
of
command
issued
by
committee
at
washington
promptly
obeyed
statements
such
as
these
are
a
travesty
upon
history
that
the
representatives
of
the
south
held
conference
with
one
another
and
took
counsel
together
as
men
having
common
interests
and
threatened
by
common
dangers
is
true
and
is
the
full
extent
of
the
truth
that
they
communicated
to
friends
at
home
information
of
what
was
passing
is
to
be
presumed
and
would
have
been
most
obligatory
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
published
proceedings
rendered
such
communication
needless
but
that
any
such
man
or
committee
of
men
should
have
undertaken
to
direct
the
mighty
movement
then
progressing
throughout
the
south
or
to
control
through
the
telegraph
and
the
mails
the
will
and
the
judgment
of
conventions
of
the
people
assembled
under
the
full
consciousness
of
the
dignity
of
that
sovereignty
which
they
represented
would
have
been
an
extraordinary
degree
of
folly
and
presumption
the
absurdity
of
the
statement
is
further
evident
from
a
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
movements
which
culminated
in
the
secession
of
the
several
states
began
before
the
meeting
of
congress
they
were
not
inaugurated
prosecuted
or
controlled
by
the
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
but
by
the
governors
legislatures
and
finally
by
the
delegates
of
the
people
in
conventions
of
the
respective
states
i
believe
i
may
fairly
claim
to
have
possessed
a
full
share
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
the
state
which
i
in
part
represented
and
proof
has
already
been
furnished
to
show
how
little
effect
my
own
influence
could
have
upon
their
action
even
in
the
negative
capacity
of
a
brake
upon
the
wheels
by
means
of
which
it
was
hurried
on
to
consummation
as
for
the
imputation
of
holding
our
seats
as
a
in
plotting
for
the
dismemberment
of
the
union
in
connection
with
which
the
count
of
paris
does
me
the
honor
to
single
out
my
name
for
special
mention
it
is
a
charge
so
dishonorable
if
true
to
its
object
so
disgraceful
if
false
to
its
author
as
to
be
outside
of
the
proper
limit
of
discussion
it
is
a
charge
which
no
accuser
ever
made
in
my
presence
though
i
had
in
public
debate
more
than
once
challenged
its
assertion
and
denounced
its
falsehood
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
always
held
and
repeatedly
avowed
the
principle
that
a
senator
in
congress
occupied
the
position
of
an
ambassador
from
the
state
which
he
represented
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
some
sense
a
member
of
the
government
and
that
in
either
capacity
it
would
be
dishonorable
to
use
his
powers
and
privileges
for
the
destruction
or
for
the
detriment
of
the
government
to
which
he
was
accredited
acting
on
this
principle
as
long
as
i
held
a
seat
in
the
senate
my
best
efforts
were
directed
to
the
maintenance
of
the
constitution
the
union
resulting
from
it
and
to
make
the
general
government
an
effective
agent
of
the
states
for
its
prescribed
purpose
as
soon
as
the
paramount
allegiance
due
to
mississippi
forbade
a
continuance
of
these
efforts
i
withdrew
from
the
position
to
say
that
during
this
period
i
did
nothing
secretly
in
conflict
with
what
was
done
or
professed
openly
would
be
merely
to
assert
my
own
integrity
which
would
be
worthless
to
those
who
may
doubt
it
and
superfluous
to
those
who
believe
in
it
what
has
been
said
on
the
subject
for
myself
i
believe
to
be
also
true
of
my
southern
associates
in
congress
with
regard
to
the
forts
arsenals
something
more
remains
to
be
said
the
authorities
of
the
southern
states
immediately
after
and
in
some
cases
a
few
days
before
their
actual
secession
took
possession
in
every
instance
without
resistance
or
bloodshed
of
forts
arsenals
and
other
public
property
within
their
respective
limits
i
do
not
propose
at
this
time
to
consider
the
question
of
their
right
to
do
so
that
may
be
more
properly
done
hereafter
but
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
briefly
to
refer
to
the
statement
often
made
that
the
absence
of
troops
from
the
military
posts
in
the
south
which
enabled
the
states
so
quietly
to
take
such
possession
was
the
result
of
collusion
and
prearrangement
between
the
southern
leaders
and
the
federal
secretary
of
war
john
floyd
of
virginia
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
allegation
to
state
the
fact
that
the
absence
of
troops
from
these
posts
instead
of
being
exceptional
was
and
still
is
their
ordinary
condition
in
time
of
peace
at
the
very
moment
when
these
sentences
are
being
written
in
although
the
army
of
the
united
states
is
twice
as
large
as
in
although
four
years
of
internal
war
and
a
yet
longer
period
of
subsequent
military
occupation
of
the
south
have
habituated
the
public
to
the
presence
of
troops
in
their
midst
to
an
extent
that
would
formerly
have
been
startling
if
not
offensive
although
allegations
of
continued
disaffection
on
the
part
of
the
southern
people
have
been
persistently
reiterated
for
party
purposes
yet
it
is
believed
that
the
forts
and
arsenals
in
the
states
of
the
gulf
are
in
as
defenseless
a
condition
and
as
liable
to
quiet
seizure
if
any
such
purpose
existed
as
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
certainly
those
within
the
range
of
my
personal
information
are
occupied
as
they
were
at
that
time
only
by
or
there
were
however
some
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
especially
in
the
defensive
works
of
the
harbor
of
charleston
the
forts
at
key
west
and
the
dry
tortugas
and
those
protecting
the
entrance
of
pensacola
bay
the
events
which
occurred
in
charleston
harbor
will
be
more
conveniently
noticed
hereafter
the
island
forts
near
the
extreme
southern
point
of
florida
were
too
isolated
and
too
remote
from
population
to
be
disturbed
at
that
time
but
the
situation
long
maintained
at
the
mouth
of
pensacola
bay
affords
a
signal
illustration
of
the
forbearance
and
conciliatory
spirit
that
animated
southern
counsels
for
a
long
time
fort
pickens
on
the
island
of
santa
rosa
at
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
was
occupied
only
by
a
small
body
of
federal
soldiers
and
marines
less
than
one
hundred
all
told
immediately
opposite
and
in
possession
of
the
other
two
forts
and
the
adjacent
was
a
strong
force
of
volunteer
troops
of
florida
and
alabama
which
might
on
short
notice
have
been
largely
increased
ready
and
anxious
to
attack
and
take
possession
of
fort
pickens
that
they
could
have
done
so
is
unquestionable
and
if
mere
considerations
of
military
advantage
had
been
consulted
it
would
surely
have
been
done
but
the
love
of
peace
and
the
purpose
to
preserve
it
together
with
a
revulsion
from
the
thought
of
engaging
in
fraternal
strife
were
more
potent
than
considerations
of
probable
interest
during
the
anxious
period
of
uncertainty
and
apprehension
which
ensued
the
efforts
of
the
southern
senators
in
washington
were
employed
to
dissuade
they
could
not
from
any
aggressive
movement
however
justifiable
that
might
lead
to
collision
these
efforts
were
exerted
through
written
and
telegraphic
communications
to
the
governors
of
alabama
and
florida
the
commander
of
the
southern
troops
and
other
influential
persons
near
the
scene
of
operations
the
records
of
the
if
preserved
will
no
doubt
show
this
to
be
a
very
moderate
statement
of
those
efforts
it
is
believed
that
by
such
influence
alone
a
collision
was
averted
and
it
is
certain
that
its
exercise
gave
great
dissatisfaction
at
the
time
to
some
of
the
ardent
advocates
of
more
active
measures
it
may
be
that
were
right
and
that
we
who
counseled
delay
and
forbearance
were
wrong
certainly
if
we
could
have
foreseen
the
ultimate
failure
of
all
efforts
for
a
peaceful
settlement
and
the
perfidy
that
was
afterward
to
be
practiced
in
connection
with
them
our
advice
would
have
been
different
certain
resolutions
said
to
have
been
adopted
in
a
meeting
of
senators
held
on
the
evening
of
the
of
january
have
been
magnified
by
the
representations
of
artful
commentators
on
the
events
of
the
period
into
something
vastly
momentous
the
significance
of
these
resolutions
was
the
admission
that
we
could
not
longer
advise
delay
and
even
that
was
unimportant
under
the
circumstances
for
three
of
the
states
concerned
had
taken
final
action
on
the
subject
before
the
resolutions
could
have
been
communicated
to
them
as
an
expression
of
opinion
they
merely
stated
that
of
which
we
had
all
become
convinced
by
the
experience
of
the
previous
month
that
our
hopes
had
proved
illusory
that
further
efforts
in
congress
would
be
unavailing
and
that
nothing
remained
except
that
the
states
should
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
as
final
judges
of
their
wrongs
and
of
the
measure
of
redress
they
recommended
the
formation
of
a
confederacy
among
the
seceding
states
as
early
as
possible
after
their
secession
advice
the
expediency
of
which
could
hardly
be
questioned
either
by
friend
or
foe
as
to
the
instructions
asked
for
with
regard
to
the
propriety
of
continuing
to
hold
their
seats
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
caused
by
some
diversity
of
opinion
which
then
and
long
afterward
continued
to
exist
and
the
practical
value
of
which
must
have
been
confined
to
senators
of
states
which
did
not
actually
secede
for
myself
i
can
only
say
that
no
advice
could
have
prevailed
on
me
to
hold
a
seat
in
the
senate
after
receiving
notice
that
mississippi
had
withdrawn
from
the
union
the
best
evidence
that
my
associates
thought
likewise
is
the
fact
that
although
no
instructions
were
given
them
they
promptly
withdrew
on
the
receipt
of
official
information
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
states
which
they
represented
it
will
not
be
amiss
here
briefly
to
state
what
were
my
position
and
feelings
at
the
period
now
under
consideration
as
they
have
been
the
subject
of
gross
and
widespread
misrepresentation
it
is
not
only
untrue
but
absurd
to
attribute
to
me
motives
of
personal
ambition
to
be
gratified
by
a
dismemberment
of
the
union
much
of
my
life
had
been
spent
in
the
military
and
civil
service
of
the
united
states
whatever
reputation
i
had
acquired
was
identified
with
their
history
and
if
future
preferment
had
been
the
object
it
would
have
led
me
to
cling
to
the
union
as
long
as
a
shred
of
it
should
remain
if
any
judging
after
the
event
should
assume
that
i
was
allured
by
the
high
office
subsequently
conferred
upon
me
by
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
the
answer
to
any
such
conclusion
has
been
made
by
others
to
whom
it
was
well
known
before
the
confederacy
was
formed
that
i
had
no
desire
to
be
its
president
when
the
suggestion
was
made
to
me
i
expressed
a
decided
objection
and
gave
reasons
of
a
public
and
permanent
character
against
being
placed
in
that
position
furthermore
i
then
held
the
office
of
united
states
senator
from
mississippi
one
which
i
preferred
to
all
others
the
kindness
of
the
people
had
three
times
conferred
it
upon
me
and
i
had
no
reason
to
fear
that
it
would
not
be
given
again
as
often
as
desired
so
far
from
wishing
to
change
this
position
for
any
other
i
had
specially
requested
my
friends
some
of
whom
had
thought
of
putting
me
in
nomination
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
in
not
to
permit
my
name
to
be
used
before
the
convention
for
any
nomination
whatever
i
had
been
so
near
the
office
for
four
years
while
in
the
cabinet
of
pierce
that
i
saw
it
from
behind
the
scenes
and
it
was
to
me
an
office
in
no
wise
desirable
the
responsibilities
were
great
the
labor
the
vexations
the
disappointments
were
greater
those
who
have
intimately
known
the
official
and
personal
life
of
our
presidents
can
not
fail
to
remember
how
few
have
left
the
office
as
happy
men
as
when
they
entered
it
how
darkly
the
shadows
gathered
around
the
setting
sun
and
how
eagerly
the
multitude
would
turn
to
gaze
upon
another
orb
just
rising
to
take
its
place
in
the
political
firmament
worn
by
incessant
fatigue
broken
in
fortune
debarred
by
public
opinion
prejudice
or
tradition
from
future
employment
the
wisest
and
best
who
have
filled
that
office
have
retired
to
private
life
to
remember
rather
the
failure
of
their
hopes
than
the
success
of
their
efforts
he
must
indeed
be
a
man
who
could
hope
to
fill
the
chair
of
washington
with
satisfaction
to
himself
with
the
assurance
of
receiving
on
his
retirement
the
meed
awarded
by
the
people
to
that
great
man
that
he
had
lived
enough
for
life
and
for
glory
or
even
of
feeling
that
the
sacrifice
of
self
had
been
compensated
by
the
service
rendered
to
his
country
the
following
facts
were
presented
in
a
letter
written
several
years
ago
by
the
hon
clay
of
alabama
who
was
one
of
my
most
intimate
associates
in
the
senate
with
reference
to
certain
misstatements
to
which
his
attention
had
been
called
by
one
of
my
friends
the
import
is
that
davis
disappointed
and
chagrined
at
not
receiving
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
for
president
of
the
united
states
in
took
the
lead
on
the
assembling
of
congress
in
december
in
a
of
southern
senators
planned
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
from
the
union
and
the
night
of
january
framed
the
scheme
of
revolution
which
was
implicitly
and
promptly
followed
at
the
south
in
other
words
that
southern
senators
and
chief
among
them
jefferson
davis
then
and
there
instigated
and
induced
the
southern
states
to
secede
i
am
quite
sure
that
davis
neither
expected
nor
desired
the
nomination
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
in
he
never
evinced
any
such
aspiration
by
word
or
sign
to
me
with
whom
he
was
i
believe
as
intimate
and
confidential
as
with
any
person
outside
of
his
own
family
on
the
contrary
he
requested
the
delegation
from
mississippi
not
to
permit
the
use
of
his
name
before
the
convention
and
after
the
nomination
of
both
douglas
and
breckinridge
he
conferred
with
them
at
the
instance
of
leading
democrats
to
persuade
them
to
withdraw
that
their
friends
might
unite
on
some
second
choice
an
office
he
would
never
have
undertaken
had
he
sought
the
nomination
or
believed
he
was
regarded
as
an
aspirant
davis
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
planning
or
hastening
secession
i
think
he
only
consented
to
it
as
a
political
necessity
for
the
preservation
of
popular
and
state
rights
which
were
seriously
threatened
by
the
triumph
of
a
sectional
party
who
were
pledged
to
make
war
on
them
i
know
that
some
leading
men
and
even
mississippians
thought
him
too
moderate
and
backward
and
found
fault
with
him
for
not
taking
a
leading
part
in
secession
no
of
secession
or
of
revolution
was
to
my
knowledge
discussed
certainly
none
matured
at
the
caucus
of
january
unless
forsooth
the
resolutions
appended
hereto
be
so
held
they
comprise
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
was
said
and
done
i
never
heard
that
the
caucus
advised
the
south
accumulate
munitions
of
war
or
organize
and
equip
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
or
determined
hold
on
as
long
as
possible
to
the
southern
seats
so
far
from
it
a
majority
of
southern
senators
seemed
to
think
there
would
be
no
war
that
the
dominant
party
in
the
north
desired
separation
from
the
south
and
would
gladly
let
their
sisters
go
in
peace
i
could
multiply
proofs
of
such
a
disposition
as
to
holding
on
to
their
seats
no
southern
legislature
advised
it
no
southern
senator
who
favored
secession
did
so
but
one
and
none
others
wished
to
do
so
i
believe
the
of
secession
if
any
and
the
purpose
of
secession
unquestionably
originated
not
in
washington
city
or
with
the
senators
or
representatives
of
the
south
but
among
the
people
of
the
several
states
many
months
before
it
was
attempted
they
followed
no
leaders
at
washington
or
elsewhere
but
acted
for
themselves
with
an
independence
and
unanimity
unprecedented
in
any
movement
of
such
magnitude
before
the
meeting
of
the
caucus
of
january
south
carolina
had
seceded
and
alabama
mississippi
florida
louisiana
and
texas
had
taken
the
initial
step
of
secession
by
calling
conventions
for
its
accomplishment
before
the
election
of
lincoln
all
the
southern
states
excepting
one
or
two
had
pledged
themselves
to
separate
from
the
union
upon
the
triumph
of
a
sectional
party
in
the
presidential
election
by
acts
or
resolutions
of
their
legislatures
resolves
of
both
democratic
and
whig
state
conventions
and
of
primary
assemblies
of
the
people
in
every
way
in
which
they
could
commit
themselves
to
any
future
act
their
purpose
was
proclaimed
to
the
world
through
the
press
and
telegraph
and
criticised
in
congress
in
the
northern
legislatures
in
press
and
pulpit
and
on
the
hustings
during
many
months
before
congress
met
in
december
over
and
above
all
these
facts
the
reports
of
the
united
states
senate
show
that
prior
to
the
of
january
southern
senators
united
with
northern
democratic
senators
in
an
effort
to
effect
pacification
and
prevent
secession
and
that
jefferson
davis
was
one
of
a
committee
appointed
by
the
senate
to
consider
and
report
such
a
measure
that
it
failed
because
the
northern
republicans
opposed
everything
that
looked
to
peace
that
senator
douglas
arraigned
them
as
trying
to
precipitate
secession
referred
to
jefferson
davis
as
one
who
sought
conciliation
and
called
upon
the
republican
senators
to
tell
what
they
would
do
if
anything
to
restore
harmony
and
prevent
disunion
they
did
not
even
deign
a
response
thus
by
their
sullen
silence
they
made
confession
without
avoidance
of
their
stubborn
purpose
to
hold
up
no
hand
raised
to
maintain

it

were
fulfilled
and
if
it
be
answered
that
the
state
did
not
demand
the
restoration
of
the
forts
or
sites
the
answer
certainly
fails
after
when
the
controversy
arose

the
unfounded
assertion
was
made
that
those

and
sites
had
been
purchased
with
the
money
and
were
therefore
the
property
of
the
united

the
terms
of
the
cession
sufficiently
manifest
that
they
were
offerings
of
such
forts
and
sites
as
belonged
to
the
state
and
public
functionaries
were
bound
to
know
that
by
the

it
was

appropriate
them

any
other
purposes
than
those
indicated
in

preamble
to
this
act

then
and
in
that
case
the
same
shall
revert
to
and
revest
in
this
by
accepting
such
grants
under
such
conditions
the
government
of
the
united
states
assented
to
their
propriety
and
the
principle
that
holds
good
in
any
one
case
is
of
course
applicable
to
all
others
of
the
same
sort
whether
expressly
asserted
in
the
act
of
cession
or
not
indeed
no
express
declaration
would
be
necessary
to
establish
a
conclusion
resulting
so
directly
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
settled
principles
of
sovereignty
and
eminent
domain
a
state
withdrawing
from
the
union
would
necessarily
assume
the
control
theretofore
exercised
by
the
general
government
over
all
public
defenses
and
other
public
property
within
her
limits
it
would
however
be
but
fair
and
proper
that
adequate
compensation
should
be
made
to
the
other
members
of
the
partnership
or
their
common
agent
for
the
value
of
the
works
and
for
any
other
advantage
obtained
by
the
one
party
or
loss
incurred
by
the
other
such
equitable
settlement
the
seceding
states
of
the
south
without
exception
as
i
believe
were
desirous
to
make
and
prompt
to
propose
to
the
federal
authorities
on
the
secession
of
south
carolina
the
condition
of
the
defenses
of
charleston
harbor
became
a
subject
of
anxiety
with
all
parties
of
the
three
forts
in
or
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
two
were
unoccupied
but
the
third
fort
moultrie
was
held
by
a
garrison
of
but
little
more
than
one
hundred
men
of
whom
only
were
said
to
be
effectives
under
command
of
major
robert
anderson
of
the
first
artillery
about
twelve
days
before
the
secession
of
south
carolina
the
representatives
in
congress
from
that
state
had
called
on
the
president
to
assure
him
in
anticipation
of
the
secession
of
the
state
that
no
purpose
was
entertained
by
south
carolina
to
attack
or
in
any
way
molest
the
forts
held
by
the
united
states
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
at
least
until
opportunity
could
be
had
for
an
amicable
settlement
of
all
questions
that
might
arise
with
regard
to
these
forts
and
other
public
property
provided
that
no
reënforcements
should
be
sent
and
the
military
should
be
permitted
to
remain
unchanged
the
south
carolinians
understood
buchanan
as
approving
of
this
suggestion
although
declining
to
make
any
formal
pledge
it
appears
nevertheless
from
subsequent
developments
that
both
before
and
after
the
secession
of
south
carolina
preparations
were
secretly
made
for
reënforcing
major
anderson
in
case
it
should
be
deemed
necessary
by
the
government
at
washington
on
the
of
december
instructions
were
communicated
to
him
from
the
war
department
of
which
the
following
is
the
essential
part
you
are
carefully
to
avoid
every
act
which
would
needlessly
tend
to
provoke
aggression
and
for
that
reason
you
are
not
without
evident
and
imminent
necessity
to
take
up
any
position
which
could
be
construed
into
the
assumption
of
a
hostile
attitude
but
you
are
to
hold
possession
of
the
forts
in
this
harbor
and
if
attacked
you
are
to
defend
yourself
to
the
last
extremity
the
smallness
of
your
force
will
not
permit
you
perhaps
to
occupy
more
than
one
of
the
three
forts
but
an
attack
on
or
attempt
to
take
possession
of
either
of
them
will
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
hostility
and
you
may
then
put
your
command
into
either
of
them
which
you
may
deem
most
proper
to
increase
its
power
of
resistance
you
are
also
authorized
to
take
similar
defensive
steps
whenever
you
have
tangible
evidence
of
a
design
to
proceed
to
a
hostile
act
these
instructions
were
afterward
modified
as
we
are
informed
by
buchanan
so
as
instead
of
requiring
him
to
defend
himself
to
the
last
extremity
to
direct
him
to
do
so
as
long
as
any
reasonable
hope
remained
of
saving
the
fort
immediately
after
the
secession
of
the
state
the
convention
of
south
carolina
deputed
three
distinguished
citizens
of
that
state
robert
barnwell
james
adams
and
james
orr
to
proceed
to
washington
to
treat
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
the
delivery
of
the
forts
magazines
lighthouses
and
other
real
estate
with
their
appurtenances
within
the
limits
of
south
carolina
and
also
for
an
apportionment
of
the
public
debt
and
for
a
division
of
all
other
property
held
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
agent
of
the
confederated
states
of
which
south
carolina
was
recently
a
member
and
generally
to
negotiate
as
to
all
other
measures
and
arrangements
proper
to
be
made
and
adopted
in
the
existing
relation
of
the
parties
and
for
the
continuance
of
peace
and
amity
between
this
commonwealth
and
the
government
at
washington
the
commissioners
in
the
discharge
of
the
duty
intrusted
to
them
arrived
in
washington
on
the
of
december
before
they
could
communicate
with
the
president
however
indeed
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
they
were
startled
and
the
whole
country
electrified
by
the
news
that
during
the
previous
night
major
anderson
had
secretly
dismantled
fort
moultrie
spiked
his
guns
burned
his
and
removed
his
command
to
fort
sumter
which
occupied
a
more
commanding
position
in
the
harbor
this
movement
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
it
was
considered
by
the
government
and
people
of
south
carolina
as
a
violation
of
the
implied
pledge
of
a
maintenance
of
the
the
remaining
forts
and
other
public
property
were
at
once
taken
possession
of
by
the
state
and
the
condition
of
public
feeling
became
greatly
exacerbated
an
interview
between
the
president
and
the
commissioners
was
followed
by
a
sharp
correspondence
which
was
terminated
on
the
of
january
by
the
return
to
the
commissioners
of
their
final
communication
with
an
endorsement
stating
that
it
was
of
such
a
character
that
the
president
declined
to
receive
it
the
negotiations
were
thus
abruptly
broken
off
this
correspondence
may
be
found
in
the
appendix
in
the
mean
time
cass
secretary
of
state
had
resigned
his
position
early
in
december
on
the
ground
of
the
refusal
of
the
president
to
send
reënforcements
to
charleston
on
the
occupation
of
fort
sumter
by
major
anderson
floyd
secretary
of
war
taking
the
ground
that
it
was
virtually
a
violation
of
a
pledge
given
or
implied
by
the
government
had
asked
that
the
garrison
should
be
entirely
withdrawn
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
on
the
refusal
of
the
president
to
consent
to
this
had
tendered
his
resignation
which
was
promptly
accepted
this
is
believed
to
be
a
correct
outline
of
the
earlier
facts
with
regard
to
the
charleston
forts
and
in
giving
it
i
have
done
so
as
far
as
possible
without
prejudice
or
any
expression
of
opinion
upon
the
motives
of
the
actors
the
kind
relations
both
personal
and
political
which
had
long
existed
between
buchanan
and
myself
had
led
him
occasionally
during
his
presidency
to
send
for
me
to
confer
with
him
on
subjects
that
caused
him
anxiety
and
warranted
me
in
sometimes
calling
upon
him
to
offer
my
opinion
on
matters
of
special
interest
or
importance
thus
it
was
that
i
had
communicated
with
him
freely
in
regard
to
the
threatening
aspect
of
events
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
winter
of
when
he
told
me
of
the
work
that
had
been
done
or
was
doing
at
fort
moultrie
that
is
the
elevation
of
its
parapet
by
crowning
it
with
barrels
of
sand
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
impolicy
as
well
as
inefficiency
of
the
measure
it
seemed
to
me
impolitic
to
make
ostensible
preparations
for
defense
when
no
attack
was
threatened
and
the
means
adopted
were
inefficient
because
any
ordinary
would
knock
the
barrels
off
the
parapet
and
thus
to
render
them
only
hurtful
to
the
defenders
he
inquired
whether
the
expedient
had
not
been
successful
at
fort
brown
on
the
rio
grande
in
the
beginning
of
the
mexican
war
and
was
answered
that
the
attack
on
fort
brown
had
been
made
with
or
at
great
distance
after
the
removal
of
the
garrison
to
the
stronger
and
safer
position
of
fort
sumter
i
called
upon
him
again
to
represent
from
my
knowledge
of
the
people
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
how
productive
the
movement
would
be
of
discontent
and
how
likely
to
lead
to
collision
one
of
the
vexed
questions
of
the
day
was
by
what
authority
the
collector
of
the
port
should
be
appointed
and
the
rumor
was
that
instructions
had
been
given
to
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
sumter
not
to
allow
vessels
to
pass
unless
under
clearance
from
the
united
states
collector
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
if
a
vessel
were
fired
upon
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
accepted
as
the
beginning
of
hostilities
a
result
which
both
he
and
i
desired
to
avert
as
the
greatest
calamity
that
could
be
foreseen
or
imagined
my
opinion
was
that
the
wisest
and
best
course
would
be
to
withdraw
the
garrison
altogether
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
the
president
objection
to
this
was
that
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
preserve
and
protect
the
property
of
the
united
states
to
this
i
replied
with
all
the
earnestness
the
occasion
demanded
that
i
would
pledge
my
life
that
if
an
inventory
were
taken
of
all
the
stores
and
munitions
in
the
fort
and
an
with
a
few
men
left
in
charge
of
them
they
would
not
be
disturbed
as
a
further
guarantee
i
offered
to
obtain
from
the
governor
of
south
carolina
full
assurance
that
in
case
any
marauders
or
lawless
combination
of
persons
should
attempt
to
seize
or
disturb
the
property
he
would
send
from
the
citadel
of
charleston
an
adequate
guard
to
protect
it
and
to
secure
its
keepers
against
molestation
the
president
promised
me
to
reflect
upon
this
proposition
and
to
confer
with
his
cabinet
upon
the
propriety
of
adopting
it
all
cabinet
consultations
are
secret
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
i
never
knew
what
occurred
in
that
meeting
to
which
my
proposition
was
submitted
the
result
was
not
communicated
to
me
but
the
events
which
followed
proved
that
the
suggestion
was
not
accepted
major
anderson
who
commanded
the
garrison
had
many
ties
and
associations
that
bound
him
to
the
south
he
performed
his
part
like
the
true
soldier
and
man
of
the
finest
sense
of
honor
that
he
was
but
that
it
was
most
painful
to
him
to
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
holding
the
fort
as
a
threat
to
the
people
of
charleston
is
a
fact
known
to
many
others
as
well
as
to
myself
we
had
been
cadets
together
he
was
my
first
acquaintance
in
that
corps
and
the
friendship
then
formed
was
never
interrupted
we
had
served
together
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
in
a
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
discipline
course
of
studies
and
general
condition
of
the
united
states
military
academy
at
the
close
of
our
labors
the
commission
had
adjourned
to
meet
again
in
washington
about
the
end
of
the
ensuing
november
to
examine
the
report
and
revise
it
for
transmission
to
congress
major
anderson
duties
in
charleston
harbor
hindered
him
from
attending
this
adjourned
meeting
of
the
commission
and
he
wrote
to
me
its
chairman
to
explain
the
cause
of
his
absence
that
letter
was
lost
when
my
library
and
private
papers
were
captured
from
my
home
in
mississippi
if
any
one
has
preserved
it
as
a
trophy
of
war
its
publication
would
show
how
bright
was
the
honor
how
broad
the
patriotism
of
major
anderson
and
how
fully
he
sympathized
with
me
as
to
the
evils
which
then
lowered
over
the
country
in
comparing
the
past
and
the
present
among
the
mighty
changes
which
passion
and
sectional
hostility
have
wrought
one
is
profoundly
and
painfully
impressed
by
the
extent
to
which
public
opinion
has
drifted
from
the
landmarks
set
up
by
the
sages
and
patriots
who
formed
the
constitutional
union
and
observed
by
those
who
administered
its
government
down
to
the
time
when
war
between
the
states
was
inaugurated
buchanan
the
last
president
of
the
old
school
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
aiding
in
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
among
us
as
of
accepting
the
doctrine
of
coercing
the
states
into
submission
to
the
will
of
a
majority
in
mass
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
when
discussing
the
question
of
withdrawing
the
troops
from
the
port
of
charleston
he
yielded
a
ready
assent
to
the
proposition
that
the
cession
of
a
site
for
a
fort
for
purposes
of
public
defense
lapses
whenever
that
fort
should
be
employed
by
the
grantee
against
the
state
by
which
the
cession
was
made
on
the
familiar
principle
that
any
grant
for
a
specific
purpose
expires
when
it
ceases
to
be
used
for
that
purpose
whether
on
this
or
any
other
ground
if
the
garrison
of
fort
sumter
had
been
withdrawn
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
from
which
the
power
to
apply
coercion
to
a
state
was
deliberately
and
designedly
excluded
and
if
this
had
been
distinctly
assigned
as
a
reason
for
its
withdrawal
the
honor
of
the
united
states
government
would
have
been
maintained
intact
and
nothing
could
have
operated
more
powerfully
to
quiet
the
apprehensions
and
allay
the
resentment
of
the
people
of
south
carolina
the
influence
which
such
a
measure
would
have
exerted
upon
the
states
which
had
not
yet
seceded
but
were
then
contemplating
the
adoption
of
that
extreme
remedy
would
probably
have
induced
further
delay
and
the
mellowing
effect
of
time
with
a
realization
of
the
dangers
to
be
incurred
might
have
wrought
mutual
forbearance
if
indeed
anything
could
have
checked
the
madness
then
prevailing
among
the
people
of
the
northern
states
in
their
thirst
for
power
and
forgetfulness
of
the
duties
of
federation
it
would
have
been
easy
to
concede
this
point
the
little
garrison
of
fort
sumter
served
only
as
a
menace
for
it
was
utterly
incapable
of
holding
the
fort
if
attacked
and
the
poor
attempt
soon
afterward
made
to
reënforce
and
provision
it
by
such
a
vessel
as
the
star
of
the
west
might
by
the
uncharitable
be
readily
construed
as
a
scheme
to
provoke
hostilities
yet
from
my
knowledge
of
buchanan
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
he
had
no
such
wish
or
purpose
his
abiding
hope
was
to
avert
a
collision
or
at
least
to
postpone
it
to
a
period
beyond
the
close
of
his
official
term
the
management
of
the
whole
affair
was
what
talleyrand
describes
as
something
worse
than
a
crime
a
blunder
whatever
treatment
the
case
demanded
should
have
been
prompt
to
wait
was
fatuity
the
attempt
secretly
to
throw
reënforcements
and
provisions
into
fort
sumter
by
means
of
the
steamer
star
of
the
west
resulted
in
the
repulsion
of
that
vessel
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
by
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
on
the
morning
of
the
of
january
on
her
refusal
to
she
was
fired
upon
and
put
back
to
sea
with
her
recruits
and
supplies
a
telegraphic
account
of
this
event
was
handed
me
a
few
hours
afterward
when
stepping
into
my
carriage
to
go
to
the
although
i
had
then
for
some
time
ceased
to
visit
the
president
yet
under
the
impulse
of
this
renewed
note
of
danger
to
the
country
i
drove
immediately
to
the
executive
mansion
and
for
the
last
time
appealed
to
him
to
take
such
prompt
measures
as
were
evidently
necessary
to
avert
the
impending
calamity
the
result
was
even
more
unsatisfactory
than
that
of
former
efforts
had
been
on
the
same
day
the
special
message
of
the
president
on
the
state
of
the
union
dated
the
day
previous
of
january
was
submitted
to
congress
this
message
was
accompanied
by
the
letter
of
the
south
carolina
commissioners
to
the
president
with
his
answer
but
of
course
by
their
rejoinder
which
he
had
declined
to
receive
buchanan
in
his
memoirs
complains
that
immediately
after
the
reading
of
his
message
this
rejoinder
which
he
terms
an
insulting
letter
was
presented
by
me
to
the
senate
and
by
that
body
received
and
entered
upon
its
journal
the
simple
truth
is
that
regarding
it
as
essential
to
a
complete
understanding
of
the
transaction
and
its
publication
as
a
mere
act
of
justice
to
the
commissioners
i
presented
and
had
it
read
in
the
senate
but
its
appearance
upon
the
journal
as
part
of
the
proceedings
instead
of
being
merely
a
document
introduced
as
part
of
my
remarks
was
the
result
of
a
discourteous
objection
made
by
a
republican
senator
to
the
reading
of
the
document
by
the
clerk
of
the
senate
at
my
request
this
will
be
made
manifest
by
an
examination
of
the
debate
and
proceedings
which
ensued
the
discourtesy
recoiled
upon
its
author
and
supporters
and
gave
the
letter
a
in
respect
of
prominence
which
i
could
not
have
foreseen
or
expected
the
next
day
january
the
speech
was
delivered
the
greater
part
of
which
may
be
found
in
the
appendix
the
last
that
i
ever
made
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
except
in
taking
leave
and
by
the
sentiments
of
which
i
am
content
that
my
career
both
before
and
since
should
be
judged
the
history
of
fort
sumter
during
the
remaining
period
until
the
organization
of
the
confederate
government
may
be
found
in
the
correspondence
given
in
the
appendix
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
still
continued
to
refrain
from
any
act
of
aggression
or
retaliation
under
the
provocation
of
the
secret
attempt
to
reënforce
the
garrison
as
they
had
previously
under
that
of
its
nocturnal
transfer
from
one
fort
to
another
another
commissioner
the
hon
hayne
was
sent
to
washington
by
the
governor
of
south
carolina
to
effect
if
possible
an
amicable
and
peaceful
transfer
of
the
fort
and
settlement
of
all
questions
relating
to
property
this
commissioner
remained
for
nearly
a
month
endeavoring
to
accomplish
the
objects
of
his
mission
but
was
met
only
by
evasive
and
unsatisfactory
answers
and
eventually
returned
without
having
effected
anything
there
is
one
passage
in
the
last
letter
of
colonel
hayne
to
the
president
which
presents
the
case
of
the
occupancy
of
fort
sumter
by
the
united
states
troops
so
clearly
and
forcibly
that
it
may
be
proper
to
quote
it
he
writes
as
follows
you
say
that
the
fort
was
garrisoned
for
our
protection
and
is
held
for
the
same
purposes
for
which
it
has
been
ever
held
since
its
construction
are
you
not
aware
that
to
hold
in
the
territory
of
a
foreign
power
a
fortress
against
her
will
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
her
citizens
is
perhaps
the
highest
insult
which
one
government
can
offer
to
another
but
fort
sumter
was
never
garrisoned
at
all
until
south
carolina
had
dissolved
her
connection
with
your
government
this
garrison
entered
it
in
the
night
with
every
circumstance
of
secrecy
after
spiking
the
guns
and
burning
the
and
cutting
down
the
of
an
adjacent
fort
which
was
then
abandoned
south
carolina
had
not
taken
fort
sumter
into
her
own
possession
only
because
of
her
misplaced
confidence
in
a
government
which
deceived
her
thus
during
the
remainder
of
buchanan
administration
matters
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse
the
old
statesman
who
with
all
his
defects
had
long
possessed
and
was
entitled
still
to
retain
the
confidence
due
to
extensive
political
knowledge
and
love
of
his
country
in
all
its
parts
who
had
in
his
earlier
career
looked
steadily
to
the
constitution
as
the
mariner
looks
to
the
compass
for
guidance
retired
to
private
life
at
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
having
effected
nothing
to
allay
the
storm
which
had
been
steadily
gathering
during
his
administration
timid
vacillation
was
then
succeeded
by
unscrupulous
cunning
and
for
futile
efforts
without
hostile
collision
to
impose
a
claim
of
authority
upon
people
who
repudiated
it
were
substituted
measures
which
could
be
sustained
only
by
force

union
her
ordinance
of
secession
being
adopted
on
the
of
january
she
was
quickly
followed
by
florida
on
the
alabama
on
the
and
in
the
course
of
the
same
month
by
georgia
on
the
and
louisiana
on
the
the
conventions
of
these
states
together
with
that
of
south
carolina
agreed
in
designating
montgomery
alabama
as
the
place
and
the
of
february
as
the
day
for
the
assembling
of
a
congress
of
the
seceding
states
to
which
each
state
convention
acting
as
the
direct
representative
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
thereof
appointed
delegates
telegraphic
intelligence
of
the
secession
of
mississippi
had
reached
washington
some
considerable
time
before
the
fact
was
officially
communicated
to
me
this
official
knowledge
i
considered
it
proper
to
await
before
taking
formal
leave
of
the
senate
my
associates
from
alabama
and
florida
concurred
in
this
view
accordingly
having
received
notification
of
the
secession
of
these
three
states
about
the
same
time
on
the
of
january
yulee
and
mallory
of
florida
fitzpatrick
and
clay
of
alabama
and
myself
announced
the
withdrawal
of
the
states
from
which
we
were
respectively
accredited
and
took
leave
of
the
senate
at
the
same
time
in
the
action
which
she
then
took
mississippi
certainly
had
no
purpose
to
levy
war
against
the
united
states
or
any
of
them
as
her
senator
i
endeavored
plainly
to
state
her
position
in
the
annexed
remarks
addressed
to
the
senate
in
taking
leave
of
the
body
i
rise
president
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
to
the
senate
that
i
have
satisfactory
evidence
that
the
state
of
mississippi
by
a
solemn
ordinance
of
her
people
in
convention
assembled
has
declared
her
separation
from
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
of
course
my
functions
are
terminated
here
it
has
seemed
to
me
proper
however
that
i
should
appear
in
the
senate
to
announce
that
fact
to
my
associates
and
i
will
say
but
very
little
more
the
occasion
does
not
invite
me
to
go
into
argument
and
my
physical
condition
would
not
permit
me
to
do
so
if
it
were
otherwise
and
yet
it
seems
to
become
me
to
say
something
on
the
part
of
the
state
i
here
represent
on
an
occasion
so
solemn
as
this
it
is
known
to
senators
who
have
served
with
me
here
that
i
have
for
many
years
advocated
as
an
essential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty
the
right
of
a
state
to
secede
from
the
union
therefore
if
i
had
not
believed
there
was
justifiable
cause
if
i
had
thought
that
mississippi
was
acting
without
sufficient
provocation
or
without
an
existing
necessity
i
should
still
under
my
theory
of
the
government
because
of
my
allegiance
to
the
state
of
which
i
am
a
citizen
have
been
bound
by
her
action
i
however
may
be
permitted
to
say
that
i
do
think
she
has
justifiable
cause
and
i
approve
of
her
act
i
conferred
with
her
people
before
that
act
was
taken
counseled
them
then
that
if
the
state
of
things
which
they
apprehended
should
exist
when
their
convention
met
they
should
take
the
action
which
they
have
now
adopted
i
hope
none
who
hear
me
will
confound
this
expression
of
mine
with
the
advocacy
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
remain
in
the
union
and
to
disregard
its
constitutional
obligations
by
the
nullification
of
the
law
such
is
not
my
theory
nullification
and
secession
so
often
confounded
are
indeed
antagonistic
principles
nullification
is
a
remedy
which
it
is
sought
to
apply
within
the
union
and
against
the
agent
of
the
states
it
is
only
to
be
justified
when
the
agent
has
violated
his
constitutional
obligations
and
a
state
assuming
to
judge
for
itself
denies
the
right
of
the
agent
thus
to
act
and
appeals
to
the
other
states
of
the
union
for
a
decision
but
when
the
states
themselves
and
when
the
people
of
the
states
have
so
acted
as
to
convince
us
that
they
will
not
regard
our
constitutional
rights
then
and
then
for
the
first
time
arises
the
doctrine
of
secession
in
its
practical
application
a
great
man
who
now
reposes
with
his
fathers
and
who
has
often
been
arraigned
for
a
want
of
fealty
to
the
union
advocated
the
doctrine
of
nullification
because
it
preserved
the
union
it
was
because
of
his
attachment
to
the
union
his
determination
to
find
some
remedy
for
existing
ills
short
of
a
severance
of
the
ties
which
bound
south
carolina
to
the
other
states
that
calhoun
advocated
the
doctrine
of
nullification
which
he
proclaimed
to
be
peaceful
to
be
within
the
limits
of
state
power
not
to
disturb
the
union
but
only
to
be
a
means
of
bringing
the
agent
before
the
tribunal
of
the
states
for
their
judgment
secession
belongs
to
a
different
class
of
remedies
it
is
to
be
justified
upon
the
basis
that
the
states
are
sovereign
there
was
a
time
when
none
denied
it
i
hope
the
time
may
come
again
when
a
better
comprehension
of
the
theory
of
our
government
and
the
inalienable
rights
of
the
people
of
the
states
will
prevent
any
one
from
denying
that
each
state
is
a
sovereign
and
thus
may
reclaim
the
grants
which
it
has
made
to
any
agent
whomsoever
i
therefore
say
i
concur
in
the
action
of
the
people
of
mississippi
believing
it
to
be
necessary
and
proper
and
should
have
been
bound
by
their
action
if
my
belief
had
been
otherwise
and
this
brings
me
to
the
important
point
which
i
wish
on
this
last
occasion
to
present
to
the
senate
it
is
by
this
confounding
of
nullification
and
secession
that
the
name
of
a
great
man
whose
ashes
now
mingle
with
his
mother
earth
has
been
evoked
to
justify
coercion
against
a
seceded
state
the
phrase
execute
the
laws
was
an
expression
which
general
jackson
applied
to
the
case
of
a
state
refusing
to
obey
the
laws
while
yet
a
member
of
the
union
that
is
not
the
case
which
is
now
presented
the
laws
are
to
be
executed
over
the
united
states
and
upon
the
people
of
the
united
states
they
have
no
relation
to
any
foreign
country
it
is
a
perversion
of
terms
at
least
it
is
a
great
misapprehension
of
the
case
which
cites
that
expression
for
application
to
a
state
which
has
withdrawn
from
the
union
you
may
make
war
on
a
foreign
state
if
it
be
the
purpose
of
gentlemen
they
may
make
war
against
a
state
which
has
withdrawn
from
the
union
but
there
are
no
laws
of
the
united
states
to
be
executed
within
the
limits
of
a
seceded
state
a
state
finding
herself
in
the
condition
in
which
mississippi
has
judged
she
is
in
which
her
safety
requires
that
she
should
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
her
rights
out
of
the
union
surrenders
all
the
benefits
and
they
are
known
to
be
many
deprives
herself
of
the
advantages
and
they
are
known
to
be
great
severs
all
the
ties
of
affection
and
they
are
close
and
enduring
which
have
bound
her
to
the
union
and
thus
divesting
herself
of
every
benefit
taking
upon
herself
every
burden
she
claims
to
be
exempt
from
any
power
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
united
states
within
her
limits
i
well
remember
an
occasion
when
massachusetts
was
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
the
senate
and
when
the
doctrine
of
coercion
was
rife
and
to
be
applied
against
her
because
of
the
rescue
of
a
fugitive
slave
in
boston
my
opinion
then
was
the
same
that
it
is
now
not
in
a
spirit
of
egotism
but
to
show
that
i
am
not
influenced
in
my
opinions
because
the
case
is
my
own
i
refer
to
that
time
and
that
occasion
as
containing
the
opinion
which
i
then
entertained
and
on
which
my
present
conduct
is
based
i
then
said
that
if
massachusetts
following
her
purpose
through
a
stated
line
of
conduct
chose
to
take
the
last
step
which
separates
her
from
the
union
it
is
her
right
to
go
and
i
will
neither
vote
one
dollar
nor
one
man
to
coerce
her
back
but
i
will
say
to
her
godspeed
in
memory
of
the
kind
associations
which
once
existed
between
her
and
the
other
states
it
has
been
a
conviction
of
pressing
necessity
it
has
been
a
belief
that
we
are
to
be
deprived
in
the
union
of
the
rights
which
our
fathers
bequeathed
to
us
which
has
brought
mississippi
to
her
present
decision
she
has
heard
proclaimed
the
theory
that
all
men
are
created
free
and
equal
and
this
made
the
basis
of
an
attack
upon
her
social
institutions
and
the
sacred
declaration
of
independence
has
been
invoked
to
maintain
the
position
of
the
equality
of
the
races
that
declaration
of
independence
is
to
be
construed
by
the
circumstances
and
purposes
for
which
it
was
made
the
communities
were
declaring
their
independence
the
people
of
those
communities
were
asserting
that
no
man
was
born
to
use
the
language
of
jefferson
booted
and
spurred
to
ride
over
the
rest
of
mankind
that
men
were
created
equal
meaning
the
men
of
the
political
community
that
there
was
no
divine
right
to
rule
that
no
man
inherited
the
right
to
govern
that
there
were
no
classes
by
which
power
and
place
descended
to
families
but
that
all
stations
were
equally
within
the
grasp
of
each
member
of
the
body
politic
these
were
the
great
principles
they
announced
these
were
the
purposes
for
which
they
made
their
declaration
these
were
the
ends
to
which
their
enunciation
was
directed
they
have
no
reference
to
the
slave
else
how
happened
it
that
among
the
items
of
arraignment
against
george
iii
was
that
he
endeavored
to
do
just
what
the
north
has
been
endeavoring
of
late
to
do
to
stir
up
insurrection
among
our
slaves
had
the
declaration
announced
that
the
negroes
were
free
and
equal
how
was
the
prince
to
be
arraigned
for
raising
up
insurrection
among
them
and
how
was
this
to
be
enumerated
among
the
high
crimes
which
caused
the
colonies
to
sever
their
connection
with
the
when
our
constitution
was
formed
the
same
idea
was
rendered
more
palpable
for
there
we
find
provision
made
for
that
very
class
of
persons
as
property
they
were
not
put
upon
the
footing
of
equality
with
white
men
not
even
upon
that
of
paupers
and
convicts
but
so
far
as
representation
was
concerned
were
discriminated
against
as
a
lower
caste
only
to
be
represented
in
the
numerical
proportion
of
three
fifths
so
stands
the
compact
which
binds
us
together
then
senators
we
recur
to
the
principles
upon
which
our
government
was
founded
and
when
you
deny
them
and
when
you
deny
to
us
the
right
to
withdraw
from
a
government
which
thus
perverted
threatens
to
be
destructive
of
our
rights
we
but
tread
in
the
path
of
our
fathers
when
we
proclaim
our
independence
and
take
the
hazard
this
is
done
not
in
hostility
to
others
not
to
injure
any
section
of
the
country
not
even
for
our
own
pecuniary
benefit
but
from
the
high
and
solemn
motive
of
defending
and
protecting
the
rights
we
inherited
and
which
it
is
our
duty
to
transmit
unshorn
to
our
children
i
find
in
myself
perhaps
a
type
of
the
general
feeling
of
my
constituents
toward
yours
i
am
sure
i
feel
no
hostility
toward
you
senators
from
the
north
i
am
sure
there
is
not
one
of
you
whatever
sharp
discussion
there
may
have
been
between
us
to
whom
i
can
not
now
say
in
the
presence
of
my
god
i
wish
you
well
and
such
i
am
sure
is
the
feeling
of
the
people
whom
i
represent
toward
those
whom
you
represent
i
therefore
feel
that
i
but
express
their
desire
when
i
say
i
hope
and
they
hope
for
peaceable
relations
with
you
though
we
must
part
they
may
be
mutually
beneficial
to
us
in
the
future
as
they
have
been
in
the
past
if
you
so
will
it
the
reverse
may
bring
disaster
on
every
portion
of
the
country
and
if
you
will
have
it
thus
we
will
invoke
the
god
of
our
fathers
who
delivered
them
from
the
power
of
the
lion
to
protect
us
from
the
ravages
of
the
bear
and
thus
putting
our
trust
in
god
and
in
our
firm
hearts
and
strong
arms
we
will
vindicate
the
right
as
best
we
may
in
the
course
of
my
service
here
associated
at
different
times
with
a
great
variety
of
senators
i
see
now
around
me
some
with
whom
i
have
served
long
there
have
been
points
of
collision
but
whatever
of
offense
there
has
been
to
me
i
leave
here
i
carry
with
me
no
hostile
remembrance
whatever
offense
i
have
given
which
has
not
been
redressed
or
for
which
satisfaction
has
not
been
demanded
i
have
senators
in
this
hour
of
our
parting
to
offer
you
my
apology
for
any
pain
which
in
the
heat
of
discussion
i
have
inflicted
i
go
hence
unencumbered
by
the
remembrance
of
any
injury
received
and
having
discharged
the
duty
of
making
the
only
reparation
in
my
power
for
any
injury
offered
president
and
senators
having
made
the
announcement
which
the
occasion
seemed
to
me
to
require
it
only
remains
for
me
to
bid
you
a
final
adieu
there
are
some
who
contend
that
we
should
have
retained
our
seats
and
fought
for
our
rights
in
the
union
could
anything
be
less
rational
or
less
consistent
than
that
a
senator
an
ambassador
from
his
state
should
insist
upon
representing
it
in
a
confederacy
from
which
the
state
has
withdrawn
what
was
meant
by
fighting
in
the
union
i
have
never
quite
understood
if
it
be
to
retain
a
seat
in
congress
for
the
purpose
of
crippling
the
government
and
rendering
it
unable
to
perform
its
functions
i
can
certainly
not
appreciate
the
idea
of
honor
that
sanctions
the
suggestion
among
the
advantages
claimed
for
this
proposition
by
its
supporters
was
that
of
thwarting
the
president
in
the
appointment
of
his
cabinet
and
other
officers
necessary
for
the
administration
of
public
affairs
would
this
have
been
to
maintain
the
union
formed
by
the
states
would
such
have
been
the
government
which
washington
recommended
as
a
remedy
for
the
defects
of
the
original
confederation
the
greatest
of
which
was
the
paralysis
of
the
action
of
the
general
agent
by
the
opposition
or
indifference
of
the
states
sad
as
have
been
the
consequences
of
the
war
which
followed
secession
disastrous
in
its
moral
material
and
political
relations
still
we
have
good
cause
to
feel
proud
that
the
course
of
the
southern
states
has
left
no
blot
nor
stain
upon
the
honor
and
chivalry
of
their
people
and
if
our
children
must
obey
they
must
but
thinking
on
our
day
less
debase
them
to
submit
chapter
iv
threats
of
departure
from
indications
of
public
will
there
be
war
organization
of
the
army
of
mississippi
lack
of
preparations
for
defense
in
the
evidences
of
the
good
faith
and
peaceable
purposes
of
the
southern
people
during
the
interval
between
the
announcement
by
telegraph
of
the
secession
of
mississippi
and
the
receipt
of
the
official
notification
which
enabled
me
to
withdraw
from
the
senate
rumors
were
in
circulation
of
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
government
to
arrest
members
of
congress
preparing
to
leave
washington
on
account
of
the
secession
of
the
states
which
they
represented
this
threat
received
little
attention
from
those
most
concerned
indeed
it
was
thought
that
it
might
not
be
an
undesirable
mode
of
testing
the
question
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
withdraw
from
the
union
no
attempt
however
was
made
to
arrest
any
of
the
retiring
members
and
after
a
delay
of
a
few
days
in
necessary
preparations
i
left
washington
for
mississippi
passing
through
southwestern
virginia
east
tennessee
a
small
part
of
georgia
and
north
alabama
a
deep
interest
in
the
events
which
had
recently
occurred
was
exhibited
by
the
people
of
these
states
and
much
anxiety
was
indicated
as
to
the
future
many
years
of
agitation
had
made
them
familiar
with
the
idea
of
separation
nearly
two
generations
had
risen
to
manhood
since
it
had
begun
to
be
discussed
as
a
possible
alternative
few
very
few
of
the
southern
people
had
ever
regarded
it
as
a
desirable
event
or
otherwise
than
as
a
last
resort
for
escape
from
evils
more
intolerable
it
was
a
calamity
which
however
threatened
they
had
still
hoped
might
be
averted
or
indefinitely
postponed
and
they
had
regarded
with
contempt
rather
than
anger
the
ravings
of
a
party
in
the
north
which
denounced
the
constitution
and
the
union
and
persistently
defamed
their
brethren
of
the
south
now
however
as
well
in
virginia
and
tennessee
neither
of
which
had
yet
seceded
as
in
the
more
southern
states
which
had
already
taken
that
step
the
danger
so
often
prophesied
was
perceived
to
be
at
the
door
and
eager
inquiries
were
made
as
to
what
would
happen
next
especially
as
to
the
probability
of
war
between
the
states
the
course
which
events
were
likely
to
take
was
shrouded
in
the
greatest
uncertainty
in
the
minds
of
many
there
was
the
not
unreasonable
hope
which
had
been
expressed
by
the
commissioner
sent
from
mississippi
to
maryland
that
the
secession
of
six
southern
states
certainly
soon
to
be
followed
by
that
of
others
would
so
arouse
the
sober
thought
and
better
feeling
of
the
northern
people
as
to
compel
their
representatives
to
agree
to
a
convention
of
the
states
and
that
such
guarantees
would
be
given
as
would
secure
to
the
south
the
domestic
tranquillity
and
equality
in
the
union
which
were
rights
assured
under
the
federal
compact
there
were
others
and
they
the
most
numerous
class
who
considered
that
the
separation
would
be
final
but
peaceful
for
my
own
part
while
believing
that
secession
was
a
right
and
properly
a
peaceable
remedy
i
had
never
believed
that
it
would
be
permitted
to
be
peaceably
exercised
very
few
in
the
south
at
that
time
agreed
with
me
and
my
answers
to
queries
on
the
subject
were
therefore
as
unexpected
as
they
were
unwelcome
on
my
arrival
at
jackson
the
capital
of
mississippi
i
found
that
the
convention
of
the
state
had
made
provision
for
a
state
army
and
had
appointed
me
to
the
command
with
the
rank
of
four
appointed
in
like
manner
by
the
convention
were
awaiting
my
arrival
for
assignment
to
duty
after
the
preparation
of
the
necessary
rules
and
regulations
the
division
of
the
state
into
districts
the
apportionment
among
them
of
the
troops
to
be
raised
and
the
appointment
of
officers
of
the
general
staff
as
authorized
by
the
ordinance
of
the
convention
such
measures
as
were
practicable
were
taken
to
obtain
the
necessary
arms
the
state
had
few
serviceable
weapons
and
no
establishment
for
their
manufacture
or
repair
this
fact
which
is
true
of
other
southern
states
as
of
mississippi
is
a
clear
proof
of
the
absence
of
any
desire
or
expectation
of
war
if
the
purpose
of
the
northern
states
to
make
war
upon
us
because
of
secession
had
been
foreseen
preparation
to
meet
the
consequences
would
have
been
contemporaneous
with
the
adoption
of
a
resort
to
that
remedy
a
remedy
the
possibility
of
which
had
for
many
years
been
contemplated
had
the
southern
states
possessed
arsenals
and
collected
in
them
the
requisite
supplies
of
arms
and
munitions
such
preparation
would
not
only
have
placed
them
more
nearly
on
an
equality
with
the
north
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
might
perhaps
have
been
the
best
conservator
of
peace
let
us
the
survivors
however
not
fail
to
do
credit
to
the
generous
credulity
which
could
not
understand
how
in
violation
of
the
compact
of
union
a
war
could
be
waged
against
the
states
or
why
they
should
be
invaded
because
their
people
had
deemed
it
necessary
to
withdraw
from
an
association
which
had
failed
to
fulfill
the
ends
for
which
they
had
entered
into
it
and
which
having
been
broken
to
their
injury
by
the
other
parties
had
ceased
to
be
binding
upon
them
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
the
calamities
which
have
befallen
the
southern
states
were
the
result
of
their
credulous
reliance
on
the
power
of
the
constitution
that
if
it
failed
to
protect
their
rights
it
would
at
least
suffice
to
prevent
an
attempt
at
coercion
if
in
the
last
resort
they
peacefully
withdrew
from
the
union
when
in
after
times
the
passions
of
the
day
shall
have
subsided
and
all
the
evidence
shall
have
been
collected
and
compared
the
philosophical
inquirer
who
asks
why
the
majority
of
the
stronger
section
invaded
the
peaceful
homes
of
their
late
associates
will
be
answered

history

according

appointment
on
the
of

their
first
work
was
to
prepare
a

constitution
for
the
new
confederacy
to
be
formed
of
the
states
which
had
withdrawn
from
the
union
for
which
the

was
adopted
the
powers
conferred
upon
them
were
adequate
for
the
performance

this
duty
the
immediate
necessity
for
which
was
obvious
and
urgent
this
constitution
was
adopted
on
the
of

continue
in

for

with
it
and

with

after
which
it
was
modeled
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
invited
to
these
documents
and
to
a
comparison
of
them
although
a
more
particular
notice
of
the
permanent
constitution
will
be
more
appropriate
hereafter
on
the
next
day
of
february
an
election
was
held
for
the
chief
executive
offices
resulting
as
i
afterward
learned
in
my
election
to
the
presidency
with
the
hon
alexander
stephens
of
georgia
as
stephens
was
a
delegate
from
georgia
to
the
congress
while
these
events
were
occurring
having
completed
the
most
urgent
of
my
duties
at
the
capital
of
mississippi
i
had
gone
to
my
home
brierfield
in
warren
county
and
had
begun
in
the
homely
but
expressive
language
of
clay
to
repair
my
fences
while
thus
engaged
notice
was
received
of
my
election
to
the
presidency
of
the
confederate
states
with
an
urgent
request
to
proceed
immediately
to
montgomery
for
inauguration
as
this
had
been
suggested
as
a
probable
event
and
what
appeared
to
me
adequate
precautions
had
been
taken
to
prevent
it
i
was
surprised
and
still
more
disappointed
for
reasons
which
it
is
not
now
necessary
to
state
i
had
not
believed
my
self
as
well
suited
to
the
office
as
some
others
i
thought
myself
better
adapted
to
command
in
the
field
and
mississippi
had
given
me
the
position
which
i
preferred
to
any
other
the
highest
rank
in
her
army
it
was
therefore
that
i
afterward
said
in
an
address
delivered
in
the
capitol
before
the
legislature
of
the
state
with
reference
to
my
election
to
the
presidency
of
the
confederacy
that
the
duty
to
which
i
was
thus
called
was
temporary
and
that
i
expected
soon
to
be
with
the
army
of
mississippi
again
while
on
my
way
to
montgomery
and
waiting
in
jackson
mississippi
for
the
railroad
train
i
met
the
hon
william
sharkey
who
had
filled
with
great
distinction
the
office
of
of
the
state
he
said
he
was
looking
for
me
to
make
an
inquiry
he
desired
to
know
if
it
was
true
as
he
had
just
learned
that
i
believed
there
be
war
my
opinion
was
freely
given
that
there
would
be
war
long
and
bloody
and
that
it
behooved
every
one
to
put
his
house
in
order
he
expressed
much
surprise
and
said
that
he
had
not
believed
the
report
attributing
this
opinion
to
me
he
asked
how
i
supposed
war
could
result
from
the
peaceable
withdrawal
of
a
sovereign
state
the
answer
was
that
it
was
not
my
opinion
that
war
be
occasioned
by
the
exercise
of
that
right
but
that
it
be
judge
sharkey
and
i
had
not
belonged
to
the
same
political
party
he
being
a
whig
but
we
fully
agreed
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
he
had
been
an
advocate
of
nullification
a
doctrine
to
which
i
had
never
assented
and
which
had
at
one
time
been
the
main
issue
in
mississippi
politics
he
had
presided
over
the
nashville
convention
in
and
had
possessed
much
influence
in
the
state
not
only
as
an
eminent
jurist
but
as
a
citizen
who
had
grown
up
with
it
and
held
many
offices
of
honor
and
trust
on
my
way
to
montgomery
brief
addresses
were
made
at
various
places
at
which
there
were
temporary
stoppages
of
the
trains
in
response
to
calls
from
the
crowds
assembled
at
such
points
some
of
these
addresses
were
grossly
misrepresented
in
sensational
reports
made
by
irresponsible
persons
which
were
published
in
northern
newspapers
and
were
not
considered
worthy
of
correction
under
the
pressure
of
the
momentous
duties
then
devolving
upon
me
these
false
reports
which
represented
me
as
invoking
war
and
threatening
devastation
of
the
north
have
since
been
adopted
by
partisan
writers
as
authentic
history
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
these
accusations
to
refer
to
my
farewell
address
to
the
senate
already
given
as
reported
for
the
press
at
the
time
and
in
connection
therewith
to
my
inaugural
address
at
montgomery
on
assuming
the
office
of
president
of
the
confederate
states
on
the
of
february
these
two
addresses
delivered
at
an
interval
of
a
month
during
which
no
material
change
of
circumstances
had
occurred
being
one
before
and
the
other
after
the
date
of
the
sensational
reports
referred
to
are
sufficient
to
stamp
them
as
utterly
untrue
the
inaugural
was
deliberately
prepared
and
uttered
as
written
and
in
connection
with
the
farewell
speech
to
the
senate
presents
a
clear
and
authentic
statement
of
the
principles
and
purposes
which
actuated
me
on
assuming
the
duties
of
the
high
office
to
which
i
had
been
called
inaugural
address
of
the
congress
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
friends
and
called
to
the
difficult
and
responsible
station
of
chief
magistrate
of
the
provisional
government
which
you
have
instituted
i
approach
the
discharge
of
the
duties
assigned
to
me
with
humble
distrust
of
my
abilities
but
with
a
sustaining
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
those
who
are
to
guide
and
aid
me
in
the
administration
of
public
affairs
and
an
abiding
faith
in
the
virtue
and
patriotism
of
the
people
looking
forward
to
the
speedy
establishment
of
a
permanent
government
to
take
the
place
of
this
which
by
its
greater
moral
and
physical
power
will
be
better
able
to
combat
with
many
difficulties
that
arise
from
the
conflicting
interests
of
separate
nations
i
enter
upon
the
duties
of
the
office
to
which
i
have
been
chosen
with
the
hope
that
the
beginning
of
our
career
as
a
confederacy
may
not
be
obstructed
by
hostile
opposition
to
our
enjoyment
of
the
separate
existence
and
independence
we
have
asserted
and
which
with
the
blessing
of
providence
we
intend
to
maintain
our
present
political
position
has
been
achieved
in
a
manner
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
nations
it
illustrates
the
american
idea
that
governments
rest
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
that
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
them
at
will
whenever
they
become
destructive
of
the
ends
for
which
they
were
established
the
declared
purpose
of
the
compact
of
the
union
from
which
we
have
withdrawn
was
to
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
and
when
in
the
judgment
of
the
sovereign
states
composing
this
confederacy
it
has
been
perverted
from
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
ordained
and
ceased
to
answer
the
ends
for
which
it
was
established
a
peaceful
appeal
to
the
declared
that
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
the
government
created
by
that
compact
should
cease
to
exist
in
this
they
merely
asserted
the
right
which
the
declaration
of
independence
of
july
defined
to
be
of
the
time
and
occasion
of
its
exercise
they
as
sovereigns
were
the
final
judges
each
for
itself
the
impartial
and
enlightened
verdict
of
mankind
will
vindicate
the
rectitude
of
our
conduct
and
he
who
knows
the
hearts
of
men
will
judge
of
the
sincerity
with
which
we
have
labored
to
preserve
the
government
of
our
fathers
in
its
spirit
the
right
solemnly
proclaimed
at
the
birth
of
the
united
states
and
which
has
been
solemnly
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
in
the
bills
of
rights
of
the
states
subsequently
admitted
into
the
union
of
undeniably
recognizes
in
the
people
the
power
to
resume
the
authority
delegated
for
the
purposes
of
government
thus
the
sovereign
states
here
represented
have
proceeded
to
form
this
confederacy
and
it
is
by
abuse
of
language
that
their
act
has
been
denominated
a
revolution
they
formed
a
new
alliance
but
within
each
state
its
government
has
remained
so
that
the
rights
of
person
and
property
have
not
been
disturbed
the
agent
through
which
they
communicated
with
foreign
nations
is
changed
but
this
does
not
necessarily
interrupt
their
international
relations
sustained
by
the
consciousness
that
the
transition
from
the
former
union
to
the
present
confederacy
has
not
proceeded
from
a
disregard
on
our
part
of
just
obligations
or
any
failure
to
perform
every
constitutional
duty
moved
by
no
interest
or
passion
to
invade
the
rights
of
others
anxious
to
cultivate
peace
and
commerce
with
all
nations
if
we
may
not
hope
to
avoid
war
we
may
at
least
expect
that
posterity
will
acquit
us
of
having
needlessly
engaged
in
it
doubly
justified
by
the
absence
of
wrong
on
our
part
and
by
wanton
aggression
on
the
part
of
others
there
can
be
no
cause
to
doubt
that
the
courage
and
patriotism
of
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
will
be
found
equal
to
any
measure
of
defense
which
their
honor
and
security
may
require
an
agricultural
people
whose
chief
interest
is
the
export
of
commodities
required
in
every
manufacturing
country
our
true
policy
is
peace
and
the
freest
trade
which
our
necessities
will
permit
it
is
alike
our
interest
and
that
of
all
those
to
whom
we
would
sell
and
from
whom
we
would
buy
that
there
should
be
the
fewest
practicable
restrictions
upon
the
interchange
of
these
commodities
there
can
however
be
but
little
rivalry
between
ours
and
any
manufacturing
or
navigating
community
such
as
the
northeastern
states
of
the
american
union
it
must
follow
therefore
that
mutual
interest
will
invite
to
and
kind
offices
on
both
parts
if
however
passion
or
lust
of
dominion
should
cloud
the
judgment
or
inflame
the
ambition
of
those
states
we
must
prepare
to
meet
the
emergency
and
maintain
by
the
final
arbitrament
of
the
sword
the
position
which
we
have
assumed
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
we
have
entered
upon
the
career
of
independence
and
it
must
be
inflexibly
pursued
through
many
years
of
controversy
with
our
late
associates
of
the
northern
states
we
have
vainly
endeavored
to
secure
tranquillity
and
obtain
respect
for
the
rights
to
which
we
were
entitled
as
a
necessity
not
a
choice
we
have
resorted
to
the
remedy
of
separation
and
henceforth
our
energies
must
be
directed
to
the
conduct
of
our
own
affairs
and
the
perpetuity
of
the
confederacy
which
we
have
formed
if
a
just
perception
of
mutual
interest
shall
permit
us
peaceably
to
pursue
our
separate
political
career
my
most
earnest
desire
will
have
been
fulfilled
but
if
this
be
denied
to
us
and
the
integrity
of
our
territory
and
jurisdiction
be
assailed
it
will
but
remain
for
us
with
firm
resolve
to
appeal
to
arms
and
invoke
the
blessing
of
providence
on
a
just
cause
as
a
consequence
of
our
new
condition
and
relations
and
with
a
view
to
meet
anticipated
wants
it
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
the
speedy
and
efficient
organization
of
branches
of
the
executive
department
having
special
charge
of
foreign
intercourse
finance
military
affairs
and
the
postal
service
for
purposes
of
defense
the
confederate
states
may
under
ordinary
circumstances
rely
mainly
upon
the
militia
but
it
is
deemed
advisable
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
that
there
should
be
a
and
disciplined
army
more
numerous
than
would
usually
be
required
on
a
peace
establishment
i
also
suggest
that
for
the
protection
of
our
harbors
and
commerce
on
the
high
seas
a
navy
adapted
to
those
objects
will
be
required
but
this
as
well
as
other
subjects
appropriate
to
our
necessities
have
doubtless
engaged
the
attention
of
congress
with
a
constitution
differing
only
from
that
of
our
fathers
in
so
far
as
it
is
explanatory
of
their
intent
freed
from
sectional
conflicts
which
have
interfered
with
the
pursuit
of
the
general
welfare
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
that
states
from
which
we
have
recently
parted
may
seek
to
unite
their
fortunes
to
ours
under
the
government
which
we
have
instituted
for
this
your
constitution
makes
adequate
provision
but
beyond
this
if
i
mistake
not
the
judgment
and
will
of
the
people
a
reunion
with
the
states
from
which
we
have
separated
is
neither
practicable
nor
desirable
to
increase
the
power
develop
the
resources
and
promote
the
happiness
of
the
confederacy
it
is
requisite
that
there
should
be
so
much
of
homogeneity
that
the
welfare
of
every
portion
shall
be
the
aim
of
the
whole
when
this
does
not
exist
antagonisms
are
engendered
which
must
and
should
result
in
separation
actuated
solely
by
the
desire
to
preserve
our
own
rights
and
promote
our
own
welfare
the
separation
by
the
confederate
states
has
been
marked
by
no
aggression
upon
others
and
followed
by
no
domestic
convulsion
our
industrial
pursuits
have
received
no
check
the
cultivation
of
our
fields
has
progressed
as
heretofore
and
even
should
we
be
involved
in
war
there
would
be
no
considerable
diminution
in
the
production
of
the
staples
which
have
constituted
our
exports
and
in
which
the
commercial
world
has
an
interest
scarcely
less
than
our
own
this
common
interest
of
the
producer
and
consumer
can
only
be
interrupted
by
exterior
force
which
would
obstruct
the
transmission
of
our
staples
to
foreign
markets
a
course
of
conduct
which
would
be
as
unjust
as
it
would
be
detrimental
to
manufacturing
and
commercial
interests
abroad
should
reason
guide
the
action
of
the
government
from
which
we
have
separated
a
policy
so
detrimental
to
the
civilized
world
the
northern
states
included
could
not
be
dictated
by
even
the
strongest
desire
to
inflict
injury
upon
us
but
if
the
contrary
should
prove
true
a
terrible
responsibility
will
rest
upon
it
and
the
suffering
of
millions
will
bear
testimony
to
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
our
aggressors
in
the
mean
time
there
will
remain
to
us
besides
the
ordinary
means
before
suggested
the
well
known
resources
for
retaliation
upon
the
commerce
of
an
enemy
experience
in
public
stations
of
subordinate
grade
to
this
which
your
kindness
has
conferred
has
taught
me
that
toil
and
care
and
disappointment
are
the
price
of
official
elevation
you
will
see
many
errors
to
forgive
many
deficiencies
to
tolerate
but
you
shall
not
find
in
me
either
want
of
zeal
or
fidelity
to
the
cause
that
is
to
me
the
highest
in
hope
and
of
most
enduring
affection
your
generosity
has
bestowed
upon
me
an
undeserved
distinction
one
which
i
neither
sought
nor
desired
upon
the
continuance
of
that
sentiment
and
upon
your
wisdom
and
patriotism
i
rely
to
direct
and
support
me
in
the
performance
of
the
duties
required
at
my
hands
we
have
changed
the
constituent
parts
but
not
the
system
of
government
the
constitution
framed
by
our
fathers
is
that
of
these
confederate
states
in
their
exposition
of
it
and
in
the
judicial
construction
it
has
received
we
have
a
light
which
reveals
its
true
meaning
thus
instructed
as
to
the
true
meaning
and
just
interpretation
of
that
instrument
and
ever
remembering
that
all
offices
are
but
trusts
held
for
the
people
and
that
powers
delegated
are
to
be
strictly
construed
i
will
hope
by
due
diligence
in
the
performance
of
my
duties
though
i
may
disappoint
your
expectations
yet
to
retain
when
retiring
something
of
the
and
confidence
which
welcome
my
entrance
into
office
it
is
joyous
in
the
midst
of
perilous
times
to
look
around
upon
a
people
united
in
heart
where
one
purpose
of
high
resolve
animates
and
actuates
the
whole
where
the
sacrifices
to
be
made
are
not
weighed
in
the
balance
against
honor
and
right
and
liberty
and
equality
obstacles
may
retard
but
they
can
not
long
prevent
the
progress
of
a
movement
sanctified
by
its
justice
and
sustained
by
a
virtuous
people
reverently
let
us
invoke
the
god
of
our
fathers
to
guide
and
protect
us
in
our
efforts
to
perpetuate
the
principles
which
by
his
blessing
they
were
able
to
vindicate
establish
and
transmit
to
their
posterity
with
the
continuance
of
his
favor
ever
gratefully
acknowledged

hopefully
look

success

note
to
the
election
of
president
of
the
confederate
states
under
the
provisional
constitution
and
some
other
subjects
referred
to
in
the
foregoing
statements
having
been
made
seeming
to
imply
that
i
was
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
of
the
confederate
states
that
my
election
was
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
or
of
accidental
complications
and
also
that
i
held
extreme
views
and
entertained
at
that
period
an
inadequate
conception
of
the
magnitude
of
the
war
probably
to
be
waged
information
on
the
subject
has
been
contributed
by
several
distinguished
members
of
the
provisional
congress
who
still
survive
from
a
number
of
their
letters
which
have
been
published
the
annexed
extracts
are
given
parts
being
omitted
which
refer
to
matters
not
of
historical
interest
from
a
communication
of
the
hon
alexander
clayton
of
mississippi
to
the
memphis
appeal
of
june
i
was
at
the
time
a
member
of
the
provisional
congress
from
mississippi
believing
that
davis
was
the
choice
of
the
south
for
the
position
of
president
before
repairing
to
montgomery
i
addressed
him
a
letter
to
ascertain
if
he
would
accept
it
he
replied
that
it
was
not
the
place
he
desired
that
if
he
could
have
his
choice
he
would
greatly
prefer
to
be
in
active
service
as
of
the
army
but
that
he
would
give
himself
to
the
cause
in
any
capacity
whatever
that
was
the
only
letter
of
which
i
have
any
knowledge
that
he
wrote
on
the
subject
and
that
was
shown
to
only
a
very
few
persons
and
only
when
i
was
asked
if
davis
would
accept
the
presidency
there
was
no
electioneering
no
management
on
the
part
of
any
one
each
voter
was
left
to
determine
for
himself
in
whose
hands
the
destinies
of
the
infant
confederacy
should
be
placed
by
a
law
as
fixed
as
gravitation
itself
and
as
little
disturbed
by
outside
influences
the
minds
of
members
centered
upon
davis
after
a
few
days
of
anxious
intense
labor
the
provisional
constitution
was
framed
and
it
became
necessary
to
give
it
vitality
by
putting
some
one
at
the
head
of
the
new
government
without
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
friends
of
either
davis
or
stephens
the
election
was
made
without
the
slightest
dissent
of
the
accidental
complications
referred
to
i
have
not
the
least
knowledge
and
always
thought
that
the
election
of
davis
arose
from
the
spontaneous
conviction
of
his
peculiar
fitness
i
have
consulted
no
one
on
the
subject
and
have
appended
my
name
only
to
avoid
resting
an
important
fact
upon
anonymous
authority
very
respectfully
yours
signed
alexander
m
clayton
from
the
hon
j
campbell
of
mississippi
now
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
if
there
was
a
delegate
from
mississippi
or
any
other
state
who
was
opposed
to
the
election
of
jefferson
davis
as
president
of
the
confederate
states
i
never
heard
of
the
fact
i
had
the
idea
that
davis
did
not
desire
to
be
president
and
preferred
to
be
in
the
military
service
but
no
other
man
was
spoken
of
for
president
within
my
hearing
it
is
within
my
personal
knowledge
that
the
statement
of
the
interview
that
davis
did
not
have
a
just
appreciation
of
the
serious
character
of
the
contest
between
the
seceding
states
and
the
union
is
wholly
untrue
davis
more
than
any
man
i
ever
heard
talk
on
the
subject
had
a
correct
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
secession
and
of
the
magnitude
of
the
war
to
be
waged
to
coerce
the
seceding
states
while
at
montgomery
he
expressed
the
belief
that
heavy
fighting
must
occur
and
that
virginia
was
to
be
the
chief
years
prior
to
secession
in
his
address
before
the
legislature
and
people
of
mississippi
davis
had
earnestly
advised
extensive
preparation
for
the
possible
contingency
of
secession
after
the
formation
of
the
confederate
states
he
was
far
in
advance
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
provisional
congress
and
as
i
believe
of
any
man
in
it
in
his
views
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
the
probable
extent
and
duration
of
the
war
and
of
the
provision
which
should
be
made
for
the
defense
of
the
seceding
states
before
secession
davis
thought
war
would
result
from
it
and
after
secession
he
expressed
the
view
that
the
war
commenced
would
be
an
extensive
one
what
he
may
have
thought
at
a
later
day
than
the
early
part
of
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
can
be
correct
as
to
that
the
idea
that
davis
was
so
in
his
views
is
a
new
one
he
was
extremely
conservative
on
the
subject
of
secession
the
suggestion
that
mississippi
would
have
preferred
general
toombs
or
cobb
for
president
has
no
foundation
in
fact
my
opinion
is
that
no
man
could
have
obtained
a
single
vote
in
the
mississippi
delegation
against
davis
who
was
then
as
he
is
now
the
most
eminent
and
popular
of
all
the
citizens
of
mississippi
very
respectfully
signed
j
p
campbell
from
the
hon
duncan
kenner
of
louisiana
recollections
of
what
transpired
at
the
time
are
very
vivid
and
positive
who
should
be
president
was
the
absorbing
question
of
the
day
it
engaged
the
attention
of
all
present
and
elicited
many
letters
from
our
respective
constituencies
the
general
inclination
was
strongly
in
favor
of
davis
in
fact
no
other
name
was
so
prominently
or
so
generally
mentioned
the
name
of
rhett
of
south
carolina
was
probably
more
frequently
mentioned
than
that
of
any
other
person
next
to
davis
the
rule
adopted
at
our
election
was
that
each
state
should
have
one
vote
to
be
delivered
in
open
session
by
one
of
the
delegates
as
spokesman
for
his
colleagues
the
delegates
of
the
different
states
met
in
secret
session
to
select
their
candidate
and
spokesman
of
what
occurred
in
these
various
meetings
i
can
not
speak
authoritatively
as
to
other
states
as
their
proceedings
were
considered
secret
i
can
speak
positively
however
of
what
took
place
at
a
meeting
of
the
delegates
from
louisiana
we
the
louisiana
delegates
without
hesitation
and
unanimously
after
a
very
short
session
decided
in
favor
of
davis
no
other
name
was
mentioned
the
claims
of
no
one
else
were
considered
or
even
alluded
to
there
was
not
the
slightest
opposition
to
davis
on
the
part
of
any
of
our
delegation
certainly
none
was
expressed
all
appeared
enthusiastic
in
his
favor
and
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
felt
so
nor
was
the
feeling
induced
by
any
solicitation
on
the
part
of
davis
or
his
friends
davis
was
not
in
or
near
montgomery
at
the
time
he
was
never
heard
from
on
this
subject
so
far
as
i
knew
he
was
never
announced
as
a
candidate
we
were
seeking
the
best
man
to
fill
the
position
and
the
conviction
at
the
time
in
the
minds
of
a
large
majority
of
the
delegates
that
davis
was
the
best
qualified
from
both
his
civil
and
military
knowledge
and
experience
induced
many
to
look
upon
davis
as
the
best
selection
that
could
be
made
this
conviction
coupled
with
his
conservative
views
for
in
no
sense
did
we
consider
davis
extreme
either
in
his
views
or
purposes
was
the
deciding
consideration
which
controlled
the
votes
of
the
louisiana
delegation
of
this
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
i
remain
respectfully
very
truly
yours
etc
signed
duncan
f
kenner
from
the
hon
james
chesnut
of
south
carolina
before
leaving
home
i
had
made
up
my
mind
as
to
who
was
the
fittest
man
to
be
president
and
who
to
be
davis
for
the
first
and
stephens
for
the
second
and
this
was
known
to
all
my
friends
as
well
as
to
my
colleagues
davis
then
conspicuous
for
ability
had
long
experience
in
civil
service
was
reputed
a
most
successful
organizer
and
administrator
of
the
military
department
of
the
united
states
when
he
was
secretary
of
war
and
came
out
of
the
mexican
war
with
much
as
a
soldier
possessing
a
combination
of
these
high
and
needful
qualities
he
was
regarded
by
nearly
the
whole
south
as
the
fittest
man
for
the
position
i
certainly
so
regarded
him
and
did
not
change
my
mind
on
the
way
to
montgomery
georgia
was
a
great
state
great
in
numbers
comparatively
great
in
wealth
and
great
in
the
intellectual
gifts
and
experiences
of
many
of
her
sons
conspicuous
among
them
were
stephens
toombs
and
cobb
in
view
of
these
facts
it
was
thought
by
all
of
us
expedient
nay
more
positively
right
and
just
that
georgia
should
have
a
corresponding
weight
in
the
counsels
and
conduct
of
the
new
government
stephens
was
also
a
man
of
conceded
ability
of
high
character
conservative
devoted
to
the
rights
of
the
states
and
known
to
be
a
power
in
his
own
state
hence
all
eyes
turned
to
him
to
fill
the
second
place
howell
cobb
became
president
of
the
convention
and
general
toombs
secretary
of
state
these
two
gifted
georgians
were
called
to
these
respective
positions
because
of
their
experience
ability
and
ardent
patriotism
rhett
was
a
very
bold
and
frank
man
so
was
colonel
keitt
and
they
as
always
avowed
their
opinions
and
acted
upon
them
with
energy
nevertheless
the
vote
of
the
delegation
was
cast
for
davis
signed
james
chesnut
from
the
hon
porcher
miles
of
virginia
formerly
of
south
carolina
and
a
member
of
the
provisional
congress
of
oak
ridge
the
best
of
my
recollection
there
was
entire
unanimity
in
the
south
carolina
delegation
at
montgomery
on
the
subject
of
the
choice
of
a
president
i
think
it
very
likely
that
keitt
from
his
warm
personal
friendship
for
toombs
may
at
first
have
preferred
him
i
have
no
recollections
of
predilections
i
think
there
was
no
question
that
davis
was
the
choice
of
our
delegation
and
of
the
whole
people
of
south
carolina
i
do
not
think
rhett
ever
attempted
to
influence
the
course
of
his
colleagues
either
in
this
or
in
matters
generally
before
the
congress
nor
do
i
think
his
personal
influence
in
the
delegation
was
as
great
as
that
of
some
other
members
of
it
if
i
were
to
select
any
one
as
having
a
special
influence
with
us
i
would
consider
robert
barnwell
as
the
one
his
singularly
pure
and
elevated
character
entire
freedom
from
all
personal
ambition
or
desire
for
place
or
position
he
declined
davis
offer
of
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
as
well
as
his
long
experience
in
public
life
and
admirably
calm
and
mind
all
combined
to
make
his
influence
with
his
colleagues
very
great
but
neither
could
he
be
said
lead
the
delegation
he
had
no
desire
and
never
made
any
attempt
to
do
so
i
think
there
was
no
delegation
in
the
congress
the
individual
members
of
which
were
more
independent
in
coming
to
their
own
conclusions
of
what
was
right
and
expedient
to
be
done
there
was
always
the
frankest
and
freest
interchange
of
opinions
among
them
but
every
one
determined
his
own
course
for
himself

i
proceeded
to
the
formation
of
my
cabinet
that
is
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
authorized
by
the
laws
of
the
provisional
congress
the
unanimity
existing
among
our
people
made
this
a
much
easier
and
more
agreeable
task
than
where
the
rivalries
in
the
party
of
an
executive
have
to
be
consulted
and
accommodated
often
at
the
expense
of
the
highest
capacity
and
fitness
unencumbered
by
any
other
consideration
than
the
public
welfare
having
no
friends
to
reward
or
enemies
to
punish
it
resulted
that
not
one
of
those
who
formed
my
first
cabinet
had
borne
to
me
the
relation
of
close
personal
friendship
or
had
political
claims
upon
me
indeed
with
two
of
them
i
had
no
previous
acquaintance
it
was
my
wish
that
the
hon
robert
barnwell
of
south
carolina
should
be
secretary
of
state
i
had
known
him
intimately
during
a
trying
period
of
our
joint
service
in
the
united
states
senate
and
he
had
won
alike
my
esteem
and
regard
before
making
known
to
him
my
wish
in
this
connection
the
delegation
of
south
carolina
of
which
he
was
a
member
had
resolved
to
recommend
one
of
their
number
to
be
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
barnwell
with
characteristic
delicacy
declined
to
accept
my
offer
to
him
i
had
intended
to
offer
the
treasury
department
to
toombs
of
georgia
whose
knowledge
on
subjects
of
finance
had
particularly
attracted
my
notice
when
we
served
together
in
the
united
states
senate
barnwell
having
declined
the
state
department
and
a
colleague
of
his
said
to
be
peculiarly
qualified
for
the
treasury
department
having
been
recommended
for
it
toombs
was
offered
the
state
department
for
which
others
believed
him
to
be
well
qualified
mallory
of
florida
had
been
chairman
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
in
the
united
states
senate
was
extensively
acquainted
with
the
officers
of
the
navy
and
for
a
landsman
had
much
knowledge
of
nautical
affairs
therefore
he
was
selected
for
secretary
of
the
navy
benjamin
of
louisiana
had
a
very
high
reputation
as
a
lawyer
and
my
acquaintance
with
him
in
the
senate
had
impressed
me
with
the
lucidity
of
his
intellect
his
systematic
habits
and
capacity
for
labor
he
was
therefore
invited
to
the
post
of
reagan
of
texas
i
had
known
for
a
sturdy
honest
representative
in
the
united
states
congress
and
his
acquaintance
with
the
territory
included
in
the
confederate
states
was
both
extensive
and
accurate
these
together
with
his
industry
and
ability
to
labor
indicated
him
as
peculiarly
fit
for
the
office
of
memminger
of
south
carolina
had
a
high
reputation
for
knowledge
of
finance
he
bore
an
unimpeachable
character
for
integrity
and
close
attention
to
duties
and
on
the
recommendation
of
the
delegation
from
south
carolina
he
was
appointed
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
proved
himself
entirely
worthy
of
the
trust
walker
of
alabama
was
a
distinguished
member
of
the
bar
of
north
alabama
and
was
eminent
among
the
politicians
of
that
section
he
was
earnestly
recommended
by
gentlemen
intimately
and
favorably
known
to
me
and
was
therefore
selected
for
the
war
department
his
was
the
only
name
presented
from
alabama
the
executive
departments
having
been
organized
my
attention
was
first
directed
to
preparation
for
military
defense
for
though
i
in
common
with
others
desired
to
have
a
peaceful
separation
and
sent
commissioners
to
the
united
states
government
to
effect
if
possible
negotiations
to
that
end
i
did
not
hold
the
common
opinion
that
we
would
be
allowed
to
depart
in
peace
and
therefore
regarded
it
as
an
imperative
duty
to
make
all
possible
preparation
for
the
contingency

on
the
of

before

arrival
at

passed
a
resolution
declaring
that
it
is
the
sense
of
this
congress
that
a
commission
of
three
persons
be
appointed
by
the
as
early
as
may
be
convenient
after
his
inauguration
and
sent
to
the
government
of
the
united

of

for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
friendly
relations
between
that
government
and
the

of

and
for
the
settlement
of
all
questions
of
disagreement
between
the
two
governments
upon
principles
of
right
justice
equity
and
good
faith
persistent
and
to
a
great
extent
successful
efforts
were
made
to
inflame
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
northwestern
states
by
representing
to
them
that
in
consequence
of
the
separation
of
the
states
they
would
lose
the
free
navigation
of
the
mississippi
river
at
that
early
period
in
the
life
of
the
confederacy
the
intercourse
between
the
north
and
south
had
been
so
little
interrupted
that
the
agitators
whose
vocation
it
was
to
deceive
the
masses
of
the
people
could
not
or
should
not
have
been
ignorant
that
as
early
as
the
of
february
an
act
was
passed
by
the
confederate
congress
and
approved
by
the
president
to
declare
and
establish
the
free
navigation
of
the
mississippi
river
that
act
began
with
the
announcement
that
the
peaceful
navigation
of
the
mississippi
river
is
hereby
declared
free
to
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
upon
its
borders
or
upon
the
borders
of
its
navigable
tributaries
and
its
provisions
secure
that
freedom
for
all
ships
boats
or
vessels
with
their
cargoes
without
any
duty
or
hindrance
except
pilotage
and
other
like
charges
by
an
act
approved
on
the
of
february
all
laws
which
forbade
the
employment
in
the
of
vessels
not
enrolled
or
licensed
and
all
laws
imposing
discriminating
duties
on
foreign
vessels
or
goods
imported
in
them
were
repealed
these
acts
and
all
other
indications
manifest
the
wish
of
the
people
of
the
confederacy
to
preserve
the
peace
and
encourage
the
most
unrestricted
commerce
with
all
nations
surely
not
least
with
their
late
associates
the
northern
states
thus
far
the
hope
that
peace
might
be
maintained
was
predominant
perhaps
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
that
there
would
be
no
war
between
the
states
lately
united
indeed
all
the
laws
enacted
during
the
first
session
of
the
provisional
congress
show
how
consistent
were
the
purposes
and
actions
of
its
members
with
their
original
avowal
of
a
desire
peacefully
to
separate
from
those
with
whom
they
could
not
live
in
tranquillity
albeit
the
government
had
been
established
to
promote
the
common
welfare
under
this
state
of
feeling
the
government
of
the
confederacy
was
instituted
my
own
views
and
inclinations
as
has
already
been
fully
shown
were
in
entire
accord
with
the
disposition
manifested
by
the
requirement
of
the
provisional
constitution
and
the
resolution
of
the
congress
above
recited
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
negotiate
friendly
relations
with
the
united
states
and
an
equitable
and
peaceable
settlement
of
all
questions
which
would
necessarily
arise
under
the
new
relations
of
the
states
toward
one
another
next
to
the
organization
of
a
cabinet
that
of
such
a
commission
was
accordingly
one
of
the
very
first
objects
of
attention
three
discreet
and
distinguished
citizens
were
selected
as
said
commissioners
and
accredited
to
the
president
of
the
northern
states
lincoln
to
the
end
that
by
negotiation
all
questions
between
the
two
governments
might
be
so
adjusted
as
to
avoid
war
and
perpetuate
the
kind
relations
which
had
been
cemented
by
the
common
trials
sacrifices
and
glories
of
the
people
of
all
the
states
if
sectional
hostility
had
been
engendered
by
dissimilarity
of
institutions
and
by
a
mistaken
idea
of
moral
responsibilities
and
by
irreconcilable
creeds
if
the
family
could
no
longer
live
and
grow
harmoniously
together
by
patriarchal
teaching
older
than
christianity
it
might
have
been
learned
that
it
was
better
to
part
to
part
peaceably
and
to
continue
from
one
to
another
the
good
offices
of
neighbors
who
by
sacred
memories
were
forbidden
ever
to
be
foes
the
nomination
of
the
members
of
the
commission
was
made
on
the
of
february
within
a
week
after
my
inauguration
and
confirmed
by
congress
on
the
same
day
the
commissioners
appointed
were
a
roman
of
louisiana
martin
crawford
of
georgia
and
john
forsyth
of
alabama
roman
was
an
honored
citizen
and
had
been
governor
of
his
native
state
crawford
had
served
with
distinction
in
congress
for
several
years
forsyth
was
an
influential
journalist
and
had
been
minister
to
mexico
under
appointment
of
pierce
near
the
close
of
his
term
and
continued
so
under
that
of
buchanan
these
gentlemen
moreover
represented
the
three
great
parties
which
had
ineffectually
opposed
the
sectionalism
of
the
republicans
roman
had
been
a
whig
in
former
years
and
one
of
the
constitutional
union
or
party
in
the
canvass
of
crawford
as
a
democrat
had
supported
breckinridge
and
forsyth
had
been
a
zealous
advocate
of
the
claims
of
douglas
the
composition
of
the
commission
was
therefore
such
as
should
have
conciliated
the
sympathy
and
coöperation
of
every
element
of
conservatism
with
which
they
might
have
occasion
to
deal
their
commissions
authorized
and
empowered
them
in
the
name
of

confederate
states
to
meet
and

furnished

power
and
authority
and
with
him
or
them
to
agree
treat
consult
and
negotiate
concerning
all
matters
in
which
the
parties
were
both
interested
no
secret
instructions
were
given
them
for
there
was
nothing
to
conceal
the
objects
of
their
mission
were
open
and
avowed
and
its
inception
and
conduct
throughout
were
characterized
by
frankness
and
good
faith
how
this
effort
was
received
how
the
commissioners
were
kept
waiting
and
while
fair
promises
were
held
to
the
ear
how
military
preparations
were
pushed
forward
for
the
unconstitutional
criminal
purpose
of
coercing
states
let

shameful
record
of
that
transaction

which
was

this

on

adopted

five
of
the
most
distinguished
citizens
of
the

were

in

proposed
conference
if
they
could
agree
with
the
commissioners
of
other
states
upon
any
plan
of

requiring

constitution
they
were
instructed
to
communicate
them
to
congress
with
a
view
to
their
submission
to
the
several
states
for
ratification
the
border
states
in

promptly
acceded
to
this
proposition
of

and
others
followed
so
that
in
the
peace
congress
or
conference
which
assembled
according
to
appointment
on
the
and
adjourned
on
the
of
february
states
were
eventually
represented
of
which
fourteen
were
northern
or
and
seven
slaveholding
states
the
six
states
which
had
already
seceded
were
of
course
not
of
the
number
represented
nor
were
texas
and
arkansas
the
secession
of
which
although
not
consummated
was
obviously
inevitable
three
of
the
northwestern
states
michigan
wisconsin
and
minnesota
and
the
two
pacific
states
oregon
and
california
also
held
aloof
from
the
conference
in
the
case
of
these
last
two
distance
and
lack
of
time
perhaps
hindered
action
with
regard
to
the
other
three
their
reasons
for
declining
to
participate
in
the
movement
were
not
officially
assigned
and
are
therefore
only
subjects
for
conjecture
some
remarkable
revelations
were
afterward
made
however
with
regard
to
the
action
of
one
of
them
it
appears
from
correspondence
read
in
the
senate
on
the
of
february
that
the
two
senators
from
michigan
had
at
first
opposed
the
participation
of
that
state
in
the
conference
on
the
ground
that
it
was
as
one
of
them
expressed
it
a
step
toward
obtaining
that
concession
which
the
imperious
slave
power
so
insolently
demands
that
is
to
say
in
plain
terms
they
objected
to
it
because
it
might
lead
to
a
compromise
and
pacification
finding
however
that
most
of
the
other
northern
states
were
represented
some
of
them
by
men
of
moderate
and
conciliatory
temper
that
writer
had
subsequently
changed
his
mind
and
at
a
late
period
of
the
session
of
the
conference
recommended
the
sending
of
delegations
of
true
unflinching
men
who
would
be
in
favor
of
the
constitution
as
it
is
that
is
who
would
oppose
any
amendment
proposed
in
the
interests
of
harmony
and
pacification
the
other
senator
exhibits
a
similar
alarm
at
the
prospect
of
compromise
and
a
concurrent
change
of
opinion
he
urges
the
sending
of
men
to
thwart
the
threatened
success
of
the
friends
of
peace
and
concludes
with
an
expression
of
the
humane
and
patriotic
sentiment
that
without
a
little
bloodletting
the
union
would
not
be
worth
a
rush
with
such
unworthy
levity
did
these
leaders
of
sectional
strife
express
their
exultation
in
the
prospect
of
the
conflict
which
was
to
drench
the
land
with
blood
and
enshroud
thousands
of
homes
in
mourning
it
is
needless
to
follow
the
course
of
the
deliberations
of
the
peace
conference
it
included
among
its
members
many
men
of
distinction
and
eminent
ability
and
some
of
unquestionable
patriotism
from
every
part
of
the
union
the
venerable
john
tyler
presided
and
took
an
active
and
ardent
interest
in
the
efforts
made
to
effect
a
settlement
and
avert
the
impending
disasters
a
plan
was
finally
agreed
upon
by
a
majority
of
the
states
represented
for
certain
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
which
it
was
hoped
might
be
acceptable
to
all
parties
and
put
an
end
to
further
contention
in
its
leading
features
this
plan
resembled
that
of
crittenden
heretofore
spoken
of
which
was
still
pending
in
the
senate
though
with
some
variations
which
were
regarded
as
less
favorable
to
the
south
it
was
reported
immediately
to
both
houses
of
the
united
states
congress
in
the
senate
crittenden
promptly
expressed
his
willingness
to
accept
it
as
a
substitute
for
his
own
proposition
and
eloquently
urged
its
adoption
but
the
arrogance
of
a
sectional
majority
inflated
by
recent
triumph
was
too
powerful
to
be
allayed
by
the
appeals
of
patriotism
or
the
counsels
of
wisdom
the
plan
of
the
peace
conference
was
treated
by
the
majority
with
the
contemptuous
indifference
shown
to
every
other
movement
for
conciliation
its
mere
consideration
was
objected
to
by
the
extreme
radicals
and
although
they
failed
in
this
it
was
defeated
on
a
vote
as
were
the
crittenden
propositions
with
the
failure
of
these
efforts
which
occurred
on
the
eve
of
the
inauguration
of
lincoln
and
the
accession
to
power
of
a
party
founded
on
a
basis
of
sectional
aggression
and
now
thoroughly
committed
to
its
prosecution
and
perpetuation
expired
the
last
hopes
of
reconciliation
and
union
in
the
course
of
the
debate
in
the
senate
on
these
grave
propositions
a
manly
and
eloquent
speech
was
made
on
the
of
march
by
the
hon
joseph
lane
a
senator
from
oregon
who
had
been
the
candidate
of
the
democratic
party
for
the
of
the
united
states
in
the
canvass
of
some
passages
of
this
speech
seem
peculiarly
appropriate
for
insertion
here
general
lane
was
replying
to
a
speech
of
andrew
johnson
of
tennessee
afterward
president
of
the
united
states
president
the
senator
from
tennessee
complains
of
my
remarks
on
his
speech
he
complains
of
the
tone
and
temper
of
what
i
said
he
complains
that
i
replied
at
all
as
i
was
a
northern
senator
president
i
am
a
citizen
of
this
union
and
a
senator
of
the
united
states
my
residence
is
in
the
north
but
i
have
never
seen
the
day
and
i
never
shall
when
i
will
refuse
justice
as
readily
to
the
south
as
to
the
north
i
know
nothing
but
my
country
the
whole
country
the
constitution
and
the
equality
of
the
states
the
equal
right
of
every
man
in
the
common
territory
of
the
whole
country
and
by
that
i
shall
stand
the
senator
complains
that
i
replied
at
all
as
i
was
a
northern
senator
and
a
democrat
whom
he
had
supported
at
the
last
election
for
a
high
office
now
i
was
as
i
stated
at
the
time
surprised
at
the
senator
speech
because
i
understood
it
to
be
for
coercion
as
i
think
it
was
understood
by
almost
everybody
else
except
as
we
are
now
told
by
the
senator
himself
and
i
still
think
it
amounted
to
a
coercion
speech
notwithstanding
the
soft
and
plausible
phrases
by
which
he
describes
it
a
speech
for
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
the
protection
of
the
federal
property
sir
if
there
is
as
i
contend
the
right
of
secession
then
whenever
a
state
exercises
that
right
this
government
has
no
laws
in
that
state
to
execute
nor
has
it
any
property
in
any
such
state
that
can
be
protected
by
the
power
of
this
government
in
attempting
however
to
substitute
the
smooth
phrases
the
and
public
property
for
coercion
for
civil
war
we
have
an
important
concession
that
is
that
this
government
dare
not
go
before
the
people
with
a
plain
avowal
of
its
real
purposes
and
of
their
consequences
no
sir
the
policy
is
to
inveigle
the
people
of
the
north
into
civil
war

the
design

that

principles
which

in

work
with
regard
to
the
right
of
secession
and
the
wrong
of
coercion
down
to
the
formation
of
the

government
the
one
was
distinctly
admitted
the
other
still
more
distinctly
disavowed
and
repudiated
by
many
of
the
leaders
of
public
opinion
in
the
north
of
both
parties
indeed
any
purpose
of
direct
coercion
was
disclaimed
by
nearly
all

organ
of
the
party
which
triumphed
in
the
election
of
had
said
soon
after
the
result
of
that
election
was
ascertained
with
reference
to
secession
we
hold
with
jefferson
to
the
inalienable
right
of
communities
to
alter
or
abolish
forms
of
government
that
have
become
oppressive
or
injurious

out

than
in

we
insist
on
letting

the
right
to
secede
may
be
a
revolutionary
right
it
exists
and
we
do
not
see
how
one
party
can
have
right
to
do
what
another
party
has
a
right
to
we
must
ever
resist
the
asserted
right
of
any
state
to
remain
in

and
nullify

defy
the

thereof
withdraw
from

of

shall
deliberately

out

the

this
work
in
the
foregoing
chapters
on
the
floor
of
the

elsewhere
more

asserted

right

nothing
that

been
quoted

in
the
exercise
of
its
free
choice
nothing
that
has
been
said
since
the

which
followed
could
furnish
a
more
striking
condemnation
of
its
origin
prosecution
purposes
and
results
a
comparison
of
the
sentiments
above
quoted
with
the
subsequent
career
of
the
party
of
which
that
journal
was
and
long
had
been
the
recognized
organ
would
exhibit
a
striking
incongruity
and
inconsistency
the
tribune
was
far
from
being
singular
among
its
northern
contemporaries
in
the
entertainment
of
such
views
as
greeley
its
chief
editor
has
shown
by
many
citations
in
his
book
the
american
conflict
the
albany
argus
about
the
same
time
said
in
language
which
greeley
characterizes
as
clear
and
temperate
we
sympathize
with
and
justify
the
south
as
far
as
this
their
rights
have
been
invaded
to
the
extreme
limit
possible
within
the
forms
of
the
constitution
and
beyond
this
limit
their
feelings
have
been
insulted
and
their
interests
and
honor
assailed
by
almost
every
possible
form
of
denunciation
and
invective
and
if
we
deemed
it
certain
that
the
real
of
the
republican
party
could
be
carried
into
the
administration
of
the
federal
government
and
become
the
permanent
policy
of
the
nation
we
should
think
that
all
the
instincts
of
and
of
manhood
rightfully
impelled
them
to
a
resort
to
revolution
and
a
separation
from
the
union
and
we
would
applaud
them
and
wish
them
godspeed
in
the
adoption
of
such
a
remedy
again
the
same
paper
said
a
day
or
two
afterward
if
south
carolina
or
any
other
state
through
a
convention
of
her
people
shall
formally
separate
herself
from
the
union
probably
both
the
present
and
the
next
executive
will
simply
let
her
alone
and
allow
all
the
functions
of
the
federal
government
within
her
limits
to
be
suspended
any
other
course
would
be
as
it
would
at
once
enlist
all
the
southern
states
in
the
controversy
and
plunge
the
whole
country
into
a
civil
war
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
wisdom
therefore
independent
of
the
question
of
right
we
should
deem
resort
to
force
most
disastrous
the
new
york
herald
a
journal
which
claimed
to
be
independent
of
all
party
influences
about
the
same
period
said
each
state
is
organized
as
a
complete
government
holding
the
purse
and
wielding
the
sword
possessing
the
right
to
break
the
tie
of
the
confederation
as
a
nation
might
break
a
treaty
and
to
repel
coercion
as
a
nation
might
repel
invasion
coercion
if
it
were
possible
is
out
of
the
question
on
the
of
january
after
six
states
had
already
seceded
a
great
meeting
was
held
in
the
city
of
new
york
to
consider
the
perilous
condition
of
the
country
at
this
meeting
james
thayer
an
whig
made
a
speech
which
was
received
with
great
applause
the
following
extracts
from
the
published
report
of
thayer
speech
will
show
the
character
of
the
views
which
then
commanded
the
cordial
approval
of
that
metropolitan
audience
we
can
at
least
in
an
authoritative
way
and
a
practical
manner
arrive
at
the
basis
of
a
cheers
we
can
at
least
by
discussion
enlighten
settle
and
concentrate
the
public
sentiment
in
the
state
of
new
york
upon
this
question
and
save
it
from
that
fearful
current
which
circuitously
but
certainly
sweeps
madly
on
through
the
narrow
gorge
of
enforcement
of
the
laws
to
the
shoreless
ocean
of
civil
war
cheers
against
this
under
all
circumstances
in
every
place
and
form
we
must
now
and
at
all
times
oppose
a
resolute
and
unfaltering
resistance
the
public
mind
will
bear
the
avowal
and
let
us
make
it
that
if
a
revolution
of
force
is
to
begin
shall
be
inaugurated
at
and
if
the
incoming
administration
shall
attempt
to
carry
out
the
line
of
policy
that
has
been
foreshadowed
we
announce
that
when
the
hand
of
black
republicanism
turns
to
and
seeks
the
fragment
of
the
constitution
to
construct
a
scaffolding
for
coercion
another
name
for
we
will
reverse
the
order
of
the
french
revolution
and
save
the
blood
of
the
people
by
making
those
who
would
inaugurate
a
reign
of
terror
the
first
victims
of
a
national
guillotine
enthusiastic
applause
and
again
it
is
announced
that
the
republican
administration
will
enforce
the
laws
against
and
in
all
the
seceding
states
a
nice
discrimination
must
be
exercised
in
the
performance
of
this
duty
you
remember
the
story
of
william
tell
let
an
arrow
winged
by
the
federal
bow
strike
the
heart
of
an
american
citizen
and
who
can
number
the
avenging
darts
that
will
cloud
the
heavens
in
the
conflict
that
will
ensue
prolonged
applause
what
then
is
the
duty
of
the
state
of
new
york
what
shall
we
say
to
our
people
when
we
come
to
meet
this
state
of
facts
that
the
union
must
be
preserved
but
if
that
can
not
be
what
then
applause
painful
and
humiliating
as
it
is
let
us
temper
it
with
all
we
can
of
love
and
kindness
so
that
we
may
yet
be
left
in
a
comparatively
prosperous
condition
in
friendly
relations
with
another
confederacy
cheers
at
the
same
meeting
horatio
seymour
asked
the
question
on
which
subsequent
events
have
cast
their
own
commentary
whether
successful
coercion
by
the
north
is
less
revolutionary
than
successful
secession
by
the
south
shall
we
prevent
revolution
he
added
by
being
foremost
in
the
principles
of
our
government
and
all
that
makes
it
valuable
to
our
people
and
distinguishes
it
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
venerable
walworth
thus
expressed
himself
it
would
be
as
brutal
in
my
opinion
to
send
men
to
butcher
our
own
brothers
of
the
southern
states
as
it
would
be
to
massacre
them
in
the
northern
states
we
are
told
however
that
it
is
our
duty
to
and
we
must
enforce
the
laws
but
why
and
what
laws
are
to
be
enforced
there
were
laws
that
were
to
be
enforced
in
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
did
lord
chatham
go
for
enforcing
those
laws
no
he
gloried
in
defense
of
the
liberties
of
america
he
made
that
memorable
declaration
in
the
british
parliament
i
were
an
american
citizen
instead
of
being
as
i
am
an
englishman
i
never
would
submit
to
such
laws
never
never
never
prolonged
applause
other
distinguished
speakers
expressed
themselves
in
similar
terms
varying
somewhat
in
their
estimate
of
the
propriety
of
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
but
all
agreeing
in
emphatic
and
unqualified
reprobation
of
the
idea
of
coercion
a
series
of
conciliatory
resolutions
was
adopted
one
of
which
declares
that
civil
war
will
not
restore
the
union
but
will
defeat
for
ever
its
reconstruction
at
a
still
later
period
some
time
in
the
month
of
february
the
free
press
a
leading
paper
in
detroit
had
the
following
if
there
shall
not
be
a
change
in
the
present
seeming
purpose
to
yield
to
no
accommodation
of
the
national
difficulties
and
if
troops
shall
be
raised
in
the
north
to
march
against
the
people
of
the
south
fire
in
the
rear
will
be
opened
upon
such
which
will
either
stop
their
march
altogether
or
wonderfully
accelerate
it
the
union
of
bangor
maine
spoke
no
less
decidedly
to
the
same
effect
the
difficulties
between
the
north
and
the
south
must
be
compromised
or
the
separation
of
the
states
be
if
the
republican
party
refuse
to
go
the
full
length
of
the
crittenden
amendment
is
the
very
least
the
south
can
or
ought
to
then
here
in
maine
not
a
democrat
will
be
found
who
will
raise
his
arm
against
his
brethren
of
the
south
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other
let
the
cry
of
the
democracy
be
compromise
or
peaceable
separation
that
these
were
not
expressions
of
isolated
or
exceptional
sentiment
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
they
were
copied
with
approval
by
other
northern
journals
lincoln
when
delivering
his
inaugural
address
on
the
of
march
had
not
so
far
lost
all
respect
for
the
consecrated
traditions
of
the
founders
of
the
constitution
and
for
the
majesty
of
the
principle
of
state
sovereignty
as
openly
to
enunciate
the
claim
of
coercion
while
arguing
against
the
right
to
secede
and
asserting
his
intention
to
hold
occupy
and
possess
the
property
and
places
belonging
to
the
government
and
collect
the
duties
and
imposts
he
says
that
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
objects
there
will
be
no
invasion
no
using
of
force
against
or
among
the
people
anywhere
and
appends
to
this
declaration
the
following
pledge
where
hostility
to
the
united
states
shall
be
so
great
as
to
prevent
competent
resident
citizens
from
holding
the
federal
offices
there
will
be
no
attempt
to
force
obnoxious
strangers
among
the
people
for
that
object
while
the
strict
legal
right
may
exist
of
the
government
to
enforce
the
exercise
of
these
offices
the
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
so
irritating
and
so
nearly
impracticable
withal
that
i
deem
it
better
to
forego
for
the
time
the
uses
of
such
offices
these
extracts
will
serve
to
show
that
the
people
of
the
south
were
not
without
grounds
for
cherishing
the
hope
to
which
they
so
fondly
clung
that
the
separation
would
indeed
be
as
peaceable
in
fact
as
it
was
on
their
part
in
purpose
that
the
conservative
and
patriotic
feeling
still
existing
in
the
north
would
control
the
elements
of
sectional
hatred
and
bloodthirsty
fanaticism
and
that
there
would
be
really
no
war
and
here
the
ingenuous
reader
may
very
naturally
ask
what
became
of
all
this
feeling
how
was
it
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
it
had
disappeared
like
a
morning
mist
where
was
the
host
of
men
who
had
declared
that
an
army
marching
to
invade
the
southern
states
should
first
pass
over
their
dead
bodies
no
question
had
arisen
no
change
in
the
attitude
occupied
by
the
seceding
states
no
cause
for
controversy
not
already
existing
when
these
utterances
were
made
and
yet
the
sentiments
which
they
expressed
were
so
entirely
swept
away
by
the
tide
of
reckless
fury
which
soon
afterward
impelled
an
armed
invasion
of
the
south
that
with
a
few
praiseworthy
but
powerless
exceptions
scarcely
a
vestige
of
them
was
left
not
only
were
they
obliterated
but
seemingly
forgotten
i
leave
to
others
to
offer
if
they
can
an
explanation
of
this
strange
phenomenon
to
the
student
of
human
nature
however
it
may
not
seem
altogether
without
precedent
when
he
remembers
certain
other
instances
on
record
of
mutations
in
public
sentiment
equally
sudden
and
extraordinary
ten
thousand
swords
that
would
have
leaped
from
their
scabbards
as
the
english
statesman
thought
to
avenge
even
a
look
of
insult
to
a
lovely
queen
hung
idly
in
their
places
when
she
was
led
to
the
scaffold
in
the
midst
of
the
vilest
taunts
and
execrations
the
case
that
we
have
been
considering
was
perhaps
only
an
illustration
of
the
general
truth
that
in
times
of
revolutionary
excitement
the
higher
and
better
elements
are
crushed
and
silenced
by
the
lower
and
baser
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
greater
extent
as
of
their
greater
violence

the
conservative
temper
of
the
people
of

was
conspicuously
exhibited
in
the
most
important
product
of
the
early
labors
of
their
representatives
in
congress
assembled
the
provisional
constitution
although
prepared
only
for
temporary
use
and
necessarily
in
some
haste
was
so
well
adapted
for
the
purposes
which
it
was
intended
to
serve
that
many
thought
it
would
have
been
wise
to
continue
it
in
force
indefinitely
or
at
least
until
the
independency
of
the
confederacy
should
be
assured
the
congress
however
deeming
it
best
that
the
system
of
government
should
emanate
from
the
people
accordingly
on
the
of
march
prepared
the
permanent
constitution
which
was
submitted
to
and
ratified
by
the
people
of
the
respective
states
of
this
constitution
which
may
be
found
in

appendix
side

of

the
hon
alexander
stephens
who
was
one
of
its
authors
very
properly
says
the
whole
document
utterly
negatives
the
idea
which
so
many
have
been
active
in
endeavoring
to
put
in
the
enduring
form
of
history
that
the
convention
at
montgomery
was
nothing
but
a
set
of
whose
object
was
the
overthrow
of
the
principles
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
erection
of
a
great
oligarchy
instead
of
the
free
institutions
thereby
secured
and
guaranteed
this
work
of
the
montgomery
convention
with
that
of
the
constitution
for
a
provisional
government
will
ever
remain
not
only
as
a
monument
of
the
wisdom
forecast
and
statesmanship
of
the
men
who
constituted
it
but
an
everlasting
refutation
of
the
charges
which
have
been
brought
against
them
these
works
together
show
clearly
that
their
only
leading
object
was
to
sustain
uphold
and
perpetuate
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
the
model
followed
throughout
with
only
such
changes
as
experience
suggested
for
better
practical
working
or
for
greater
perspicuity
the
preamble
to
both
instruments
is
the
same
in
substance
and
very
nearly
identical
in
language
the
words
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
one
are
replaced
by
we
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
in
the
other
and
the
gross
perversion
which
has
been
made
of
the
former
expression
is
precluded
in
the
latter
merely
by
the
addition
of
the
explanatory
clause
each
state
acting
in
its
sovereign
and
independent
character
an
explanation
which
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
have
been
deemed
entirely
superfluous
the
official
term
of
the
president
was
fixed
at
six
instead
of
four
years
and
it
was
provided
that
he
should
not
be
eligible
for
reëlection
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
original
draft
of
the
constitution
of
the
president
was
empowered
to
remove
officers
of
his
cabinet
or
those
engaged
in
the
diplomatic
service
at
his
discretion
but
in
all
other
cases
removal
from
office
could
be
made
only
for
cause
and
the
cause
was
to
be
reported
to
the
senate
congress
was
authorized
to
provide
by
law
for
the
admission
of
the
principal
officer
in
each
of
the
executive
departments
or
cabinet
officers
to
a
seat
upon
the
floor
of
either
house
with
the
privilege
of
taking
part
in
the
discussion
of
subjects
pertaining
to
his
department
this
wise
and
judicious
provision
which
would
have
tended
to
obviate
much
delay
and
misunderstanding
was
however
never
put
into
execution
by
the
necessary
legislation
protective
duties
for
the
benefit
of

branches

which
had
been
so
fruitful

additional
provision
however

judicial
or
other
officer
exercising
his
functions
solely
within
the
limits
of

the
the
provisions
of
this
constitution
furnish
an
effectual
answer
to
the
assertion
so
often
made
that
the
confederacy
was
founded
on
slavery
that
slavery
was
its
etc
property
in
slaves
was
recognized
and
guaranteed
just
as
it
was
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
rights
of
such
property
in
the
common
territories
were
protected
against
any
such
hostile
discrimination
as
had
been
attempted
in
the
union
but
the
extension
of
slavery
in
the
only
practical
sense
of
that
phrase
was
more
distinctly
and
effectually
precluded
by
the
confederate
than
by
the
federal
constitution
this
will
be
manifest
on
a
comparison
of
the
provisions
of
the
two
relative
to
the
these
are
found
at
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
section
of
the
first
article
of
each
instrument
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
the
following
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
shall
not
be
prohibited
by
the
congress
prior
to
the
year
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
eight
but
a
tax
or
duty
may
be
imposed
on
such
importations
not
exceeding
ten
dollars
for
each
person
the
confederate
constitution
on
the
other
hand
ordained
as
follows
the
importation
of
negroes
of
the
african
race
from
any
foreign
country
other
than
the
slaveholding
states
or
territories
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
hereby
forbidden
and
congress
is
required
to
pass
such
laws
as
shall
effectually
prevent
the
same
congress
shall
also
have
the
power
to
prohibit
the
introduction
of
slaves
from
any
state
not
a
member
of
or
territory
not
belonging
to
this
confederacy
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
the
only
prohibition
is
against
any
interference
by
congress
with
the
for
a
term
of
years
and
it
was
further
legitimized
by
the
authority
given
to
impose
a
duty
upon
it
the
term
of
years
it
is
true
had
long
since
expired
but
there
was
still
no
prohibition
of
the
trade
by
the
constitution
it
was
after
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
congress
either
to
encourage
tolerate
or
prohibit
it
under
the
confederate
constitution
on
the
contrary
the
african
was
positively
and
unconditionally
from
the
beginning
neither
the
confederate
government
nor
that
of
any
of
the
states
could
permit
it
and
the
congress
was
expressly
required
to
enforce
the
prohibition
the
only
discretion
in
the
matter
intrusted
to
the
congress
was
whether
or
not
to
permit
the
introduction
of
slaves
from
any
of
the
united
states
or
their
territories
lincoln
in
his
inaugural
address
had
said
i
have
no
purpose
directly
or
indirectly
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
states
where
it
exists
i
believe
i
have
no
lawful
right
to
do
so
and
i
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
now
if
there
was
no
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
within
its
already
existing
limits
a
proposition
which
permitted
its
propagation
within
those
limits
by
natural
increase
and
inasmuch
as
the
confederate
constitution
precluded
any
other
than
the
same
natural
increase
we
may
plainly
perceive
the
disingenuousness
and
absurdity
of
the
pretension
by
which
a
factitious
sympathy
has
been
obtained
in
certain
quarters
for
the
war
upon
the
south
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
war
in
behalf
of
freedom
against
slavery
i
had
no
direct
part
in
the
preparation
of
the
confederate
constitution
no
consideration
of
delicacy
forbids
me
therefore
to
say
in
closing
this
brief
review
of
that
instrument
that
it
was
a
model
of
wise
temperate
and
liberal
statesmanship
intelligent
criticism
from
hostile
as
well
as
friendly
sources
has
been
compelled
to
admit
its
excellences
and
has
sustained
the
judgment
of
a
popular
northern
journal
which
said
a
few
days
after
it
was
adopted
and
published
the
new
constitution
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
with
various
modifications
and
some
very
important
and
most
desirable
improvements
we
are
free
to
say
that
the
invaluable
reforms
enumerated
should
be
adopted
by
the
united
states
with
or
without
a
reunion
of
the
seceded
states
and
as
soon
as
possible
but
why
not
accept
them
with
the
propositions
of
the
confederate
states
on
slavery
as
a
basis
of
reunion

to
you
the
assurance
of
my
distinguished
consideration
signed
jefferson
davis
montgomery
it
may
here
be
mentioned
in
explanation
of
my
desire
that
the
commission
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
should
reach
washington
before
the
close
of
buchanan
term
that
i
had
received
an
intimation
from
him
through
a
distinguished
senator
of
one
of
the
border
states
that
he
would
be
happy
to
receive
a
commissioner
or
commissioners
from
the
confederate
states
and
would
refer
to
the
senate
any
communication
that
might
be
made
through
such
a
commission
crawford
now
a
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
only
surviving
member
of
the
commission
in
a
manuscript
account
which
he
has
kindly
furnished
of
his
recollections
of
events
connected
with
it
says
that
on
arriving
in
washington
at
the
early
hour
of
four
in
the
morning
he
was
surprised
to
see
pennsylvania
avenue
from
the
old
national
to
willard
hotel
crowded
with
men
hurrying
some
toward
the
former
but
most
of
the
faces
in
the
direction
of
the
latter
where
the
new
president
lincoln
the
great
political
almoner
for
the
time
being
had
taken
up
his
lodgings
at
this
point
continues
judge
crawford
the
crowd
swelled
to
astonishing
numbers
of
expectant
and
hopeful
men
awaiting
an
opportunity
either
to
see
lincoln
himself
or
to
communicate
with
him
through
some
one
who
might
be
so
fortunate
as
to
have
access
to
his
presence
describing
his
reception
in
the
federal
capital
judge
crawford
says
the
feverish
and
emotional
condition
of
affairs
soon
made
the
presence
of
the
special
commissioner
at
washington
known
throughout
the
city
congress
was
still
of
course
in
session
senators
and
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
excepting
those
of
the
confederate
states
who
had
withdrawn
were
in
their
seats
and
the
manifestations
of
anxious
care
and
gloomy
forebodings
were
plainly
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
this
was
not
confined
to
sections
but
existed
among
the
men
of
the
north
and
west
as
well
as
those
of
the
south
buchanan
the
president
was
in
a
state
of
most
thorough
alarm
not
only
for
his
home
at
wheatland
but
for
his
personal
safety
in
the
very
few
days
which
had
elapsed
between
the
time
of
his
promise
to
receive
a
commissioner
from
the
confederate
states
and
the
actual
arrival
of
the
commissioner
he
had
become
so
fearfully
that
he
declined
either
to
receive
him
or
to
send
any
message
to
the
senate
touching
the
of
his
mission
the
commissioner
had
been
for
several
years
in
congress
before
the
administration
of
buchanan
as
well
as
during
his
official
term
and
had
always
been
in
close
political
and
social
relations
with
him
yet
he
was
afraid
of
a
public
visit
from
him
he
said
that
he
had
only
three
days
of
official
life
left
and
could
incur
no
further
dangers
or
reproaches
than
those
he
had
already
borne
from
the
press
and
public
speakers
of
the
north
the
intensity
of
the
prevalent
feeling
increased
as
the
vast
crowds
arriving
by
every
train
added
fresh
material
and
hatred
and
hostility
toward
our
new
government
were
manifested
in
almost
every
conceivable
manner
another
of
the
commissioners
forsyth
having
arrived
in
washington
on
the
of
march
eight
days
after
the
inauguration
of
lincoln
the
two
commissioners
then
present
forsyth
and
crawford
addressed
to
seward
secretary
of
state
a
note
informing
him
of
their
presence
stating
the
friendly
and
peaceful
purposes
of
their
mission
and
requesting
the
appointment
of
a
day
as
early
as
possible
for
the
presentation
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
their
credentials
and
the
objects
which
they
had
in
view
this
letter
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
with
other
correspondence
which
ensued
published
soon
after
the
events
to
which
it
relates
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
specially
invited
to
these
documents
but
as
additional
revelations
have
been
made
since
they
were
first
published
it
will
be
proper
in
order
to
a
full
understanding
of
the
transactions
to
which
they
refer
to
give
here
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
no
answer
to
the
note
of
the
commissioners
was
delivered
to
them
for
days
after
it
was
written
the
paper
of
seward
in
reply
without
signature
or
address
dated
march
was
filed
as
he
states
on
that
day
in
the
department
of
state
but
a
copy
of
it
was
not
handed
to
the
commissioners
until
the
of
april
but
an
oral
answer
had
been
made
to
the
note
of
the
commissioners
at
a
much
earlier
date
for
the
significance
of
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
the
condition
of
affairs
at
charleston
and
pensacola
fort
sumter
was
still
occupied
by
the
garrison
under
command
of
major
anderson
with
no
material
change
in
the
circumstances
since
the
failure
of
the
attempt
made
in
january
to
reënforce
it
by
means
of
the
star
of
the
west
this
standing
menace
at
the
gates
of
the
chief
harbor
of
south
carolina
had
been
tolerated
by
the
government
and
people
of
that
state
and
afterward
by
the
confederate
authorities
in
the
abiding
hope
that
it
would
be
removed
without
compelling
a
collision
of
forces
fort
pickens
on
one
side
of
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
of
pensacola
was
also
occupied
by
a
garrison
of
united
states
troops
while
the
two
forts
barrancas
and
mcree
on
the
other
side
were
in
possession
of
the
confederates
communication
by
sea
was
not
entirely
precluded
however
in
the
case
of
fort
pickens
the
garrison
had
been
strengthened
and
a
fleet
of
federal
was
lying
outside
of
the
harbor
the
condition
of
affairs
at
these
forts
especially
at
fort
sumter
was
a
subject
of
anxiety
with
the
friends
of
peace
and
the
hope
of
settling
by
negotiation
the
questions
involved
in
their
occupation
had
been
one
of
the
most
urgent
motives
for
the
prompt
dispatch
of
the
commissioners
to
washington
the
letter
of
the
commissioners
to
seward
was
written
as
we
have
seen
on
the
of
march
the
oral
message
above
mentioned
was
obtained
and
communicated
to
the
commissioners
through
the
agency
of
two
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
justices
nelson
of
new
york
and
campbell
of
alabama
on
the
of
march
according
to
the
statement
of
judge
campbell
justice
nelson
visited
the
secretaries
of
state
and
of
the
treasury
and
the
seward
chase
and
bates
to
dissuade
them
from
undertaking
to
put
in
execution
any
policy
of
coercion
during
the
term
of
the
supreme
court
he
had
very
carefully
examined
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
enable
him
to
attain
his
conclusions
and
from
time
to
time
he
had
consulted
the
chief
justice
taney
upon
the
questions
which
his
examination
had
suggested
his
conclusion
was
that
without
very
serious
violations
of
constitution
and
statutes
coercion
could
not
be
successfully
effected
by
the
executive
department
i
had
made
continues
judge
campbell
a
similar
examination
and
i
concurred
in
his
conclusions
and
opinions
as
he
was
returning
from
his
visit
to
the
state
department
we
casually
met
and
he
informed
me
of
what
he
had
done
he
said
he
had
spoken
to
these
officers
at
large
that
he
was
received
with
respect
and
listened
to
with
attention
by
all
with
approbation
by
the
and
with
great
cordiality
by
the
secretary
of
state
that
the
secretary
had
expressed
gratification
to
find
so
many
impediments
to
the
disturbance
of
peace
and
only
wished
there
had
been
more
he
stated
that
the
secretary
told
him
there
was
a
present
cause
of
embarrassment
that
the
southern
commissioners
had
demanded
recognition
and
a
refusal
would
lead
to
irritation
and
excitement
in
the
southern
states
and
would
cause
a
and
excitement
in
the
northern
states
prejudicial
to
a
peaceful
adjustment
justice
nelson
suggested
that
i
might
be
of
service
the
result
of
the
interview
between
these
two
distinguished
gentlemen
we
are
informed
was
another
visit
by
both
of
them
to
the
state
department
for
the
purpose
of
urging
seward
to
reply
to
the
commissioners
and
assure
them
of
the
desire
of
the
united
states
government
for
a
friendly
adjustment
seward
seems
to
have
objected
to
an
immediate
recognition
of
the
commissioners
on
the
ground
that
the
state
of
public
sentiment
in
the
north
would
not
sustain
it
in
connection
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
fort
sumter
which
had
been
determined
on
the
evacuation
of
sumter
he
said
is
as
much
as
the
administration
can
bear
judge
campbell
adds
i
concurred
in
the
conclusion
that
the
evacuation
of
sumter
involved
responsibility
and
stated
that
there
could
not
be
too
much
caution
in
the
adoption
of
measures
so
as
not
to
shock
or
to
irritate
the
public
sentiment
and
that
the
evacuation
of
sumter
was
sufficient
for
the
present
in
that
direction
i
stated
that
i
would
see
the
commissioners
and
i
would
write
to
davis
to
that
effect
i
asked
him
what
i
should
say
as
to
sumter
and
as
to
pickens
authorized
me
to
say
that
before
that
letter
could
reach
davis
would
learn
by
telegraph
that
the
order
for
the
evacuation
of
sumter
had
been
he
said
the
condition
of
pickens
was
satisfactory
and
there
would
be
no
change
made
there
the
italics
in
this
extract
are
my
own
the
letter
in
which
this
promise
was
communicated
to
me
has
been
lost
but
it
was
given
in
substantially
the
terms
above
stated
as
authorized
by
seward
that
the
order
for
the
evacuation
of
the
fort
would
be
issued
before
the
letter
could
reach
me
the
same
assurance
was
given
on
the
same
day
to
the
commissioners
judge
campbell
tells
us
that
crawford
was
slow
to
consent
to
refrain
from
pressing
the
demand
for
recognition
it
was
only
after
some
discussion
and
the
expression
of
some
objections
that
he
consented
to
do
so
this
consent
was
clearly
one
part
of
a
stipulation
of
which
the
other
part
was
the
pledge
that
the
fort
would
be
evacuated
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
crawford
required
the
pledge
of
seward
to
be
reduced
to
writing
with
judge
campbell
personal
assurance
of
its
genuineness
and
accuracy
this
written
statement
was
exhibited
to
judge
nelson
before
its
delivery
and
approved
by
him
the
fact
that
the
pledge
had
been
given
in
his
name
and
behalf
was
communicated
to
seward
the
same
evening
by
letter
he
was
cognizant
of
consenting
to
and
in
great
part
the
author
of
the
whole
transaction
it
will
be
observed
that
not
only
the
commissioners
in
washington
but
the
confederate
government
at
montgomery
also
were
thus
assured
on
the
highest
authority
that
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
the
official
organ
of
communication
of
the
views
and
purposes
of
his
government
of
the
intention
of
that
government
to
order
the
evacuation
of
fort
sumter
within
a
few
days
from
the
of
march
and
not
to
disturb
the
existing
at
fort
pickens
moreover
this
was
not
the
mere
statement
of
a
fact
but
a
given
as
the
consideration
of
an
appeal
to
the
confederate
government
and
its
commissioners
to
refrain
from
embarrassing
the
federal
administration
by
prosecuting
any
further
claims
at
the
same
time
as
such
a
pledge
it
was
accepted
and
while
its
fulfillment
was
quietly
awaited
the
commissioners
forbore
to
make
any
further
demand
for
reply
to
their
note
of
the
of
march
five
days
having
elapsed
in
this
condition
of
affairs
the
commissioners
in
washington
telegraphed
beauregard
commander
of
the
confederate
forces
at
charleston
inquiring
whether
the
fort
had
been
evacuated
or
any
action
taken
by
major
anderson
indicating
the
probability
of
an
evacuation
answer
was
made
to
this
dispatch
that
the
fort
had
not
been
evacuated
that
there
were
no
indications
of
such
a
purpose
but
that
major
anderson
was
still
working
on
its
defenses
this
dispatch
was
taken
to
seward
by
judge
campbell
two
interviews
occurred
in
relation
to
it
at
both
of
which
judge
nelson
was
also
present
of
the
result
of
these
interviews
judge
campbell
states
the
last
was
full
and
satisfactory
the
secretary
was
buoyant
and
sanguine
he
spoke
of
his
ability
to
carry
through
his
policy
with
confidence
he
accounted
for
the
delay
as
accidental
and
involving
the
integrity
of
his
assurance
that
the
evacuation
would
take
and
that
i
should
know
whenever
any
change
was
made
in
the
resolution
in
reference
to
sumter
or
to
pickens
i
repeated
this
assurance
in
writing
to
judge
crawford
informed
governor
seward
in
writing
what
i
had
it
would
be
incredible
but
for
the
ample
proofs
which
have
since
been
brought
to
light
that
during
all
this
period
of
reiterated
assurances
of
a
purpose
to
withdraw
the
garrison
from
fort
sumter
and
of
excuses
for
delay
on
account
of
the
difficulties
which
embarrassed
it
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
assiduously
engaged
in
devising
means
for
furnishing
supplies
and
reënforcements
to
the
garrison
with
the
view
of
retaining
possession
of
the
fort
fox
afterward
assistant
secretary
of
the
united
states
navy
had
proposed
a
plan
for
reënforcing
and
furnishing
supplies
to
the
garrison
of
fort
sumter
in
february
during
the
administration
of
buchanan
in
a
letter
published
in
the
newspapers
since
the
war
he
gives
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
proposition
was
renewed
to
the
new
administration
and
its
reception
by
them
as
follows
on
the
of
march
i
received
a
telegram
from
blair
to
come
to
washington
i
arrived
there
on
the
blair
having
been
acquainted
with
the
proposition
i
presented
to
general
scott
under
administration
sent
for
me
to
tender
the
same
to
lincoln
informing
me
that
scott
had
advised
the
president
that
the
fort
could
not
be
relieved
and
must
be
given
up
blair
took
me
at
once
to
the
white
house
and
i
explained
the
plan
to
the
president
thence
we
adjourned
to
scott
office
where
a
renewed
discussion
of
the
subject
took
place
the
general
informed
the
president
that
my
plan
was
practicable
in
february
but
that
the
increased
number
of
batteries
erected
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
since
that
time
rendered
it
impossible
in
march
finding
that
there
was
great
opposition
to
any
attempt
at
relieving
fort
sumter
and
that
blair
alone
sustained
the
president
in
his
policy
of
refusing
to
yield
i
judged
that
my
arguments
in
favor
of
the
practicability
of
sending
in
supplies
would
be
strengthened
by
a
visit
to
charleston
and
the
fort
the
president
readily
agreed
to
my
visit
if
the
secretary
of
war
and
general
scott
raised
no
objection
both
these
gentlemen
consenting
i
left
washington
on
the
of
march
and
passing
through
richmond
and
wilmington
reached
charleston
on
the
thus
we
see
that
at
the
very
moment
when
secretary
seward
was
renewing
to
the
confederate
government
through
judge
campbell
his
positive
assurance
that
the
evacuation
take
place
this
emissary
was
on
his
way
to
charleston
to
obtain
information
and
devise
measures
by
means
of
which
this
promise
might
be
broken
on
his
arrival
in
charleston
fox
tells
us
that
he
sought
an
interview
with
captain
hartstein
of
the
confederate
navy
and
through
this
officer
obtained
from
governor
pickens
permission
to
visit
fort
sumter
he
fails
in
his
narrative
to
state
what
we
learn
from
governor
pickens
himself
that
this
permission
was
obtained
expressly
upon
the
pledge
of
purposes
notwithstanding
this
pledge
he
employed
the
opportunity
afforded
by
his
visit
to
mature
the
details
of
his
plan
for
furnishing
supplies
and
reënforcements
to
the
garrison
he
did
not
he
says
communicate
his
plan
or
purposes
to
major
anderson
the
commanding
officer
of
the
garrison
having
discernment
enough
perhaps
to
divine
that
the
instincts
of
that
brave
and
honest
soldier
would
have
revolted
at
and
rebuked
the
duplicity
and
perfidy
of
the
whole
transaction
the
result
of
his
visit
was
however
reported
at
washington
his
plan
was
approved
by
president
lincoln
and
he
was
sent
to
new
york
to
make
arrangements
for
putting
it
in
execution
in
a
very
few
days
after
says
governor
pickens
in
the
message
already
quoted
above
another
confidential
agent
colonel
lamon
was
sent
by
the
president
lincoln
who
informed
me
that
he
had
come
to
try
and
arrange
for
the
removal
of
the
garrison
and
when
he
returned
from
the
fort
asked
if
a
could
not
be
allowed
to
remove
them
i
replied
that
no
could
be
allowed
to
enter
the
harbor
on
any
terms
he
said
he
believed
major
anderson
preferred
an
ordinary
steamer
and
i
agreed
that
the
garrison
might
be
thus
removed
he
said
he
hoped
to
return
in
a
very
few
days
for
that
purpose
this
it
will
be
remembered
occurred
while
fox
was
making
active
though
secret
preparations
for
his
relief
expedition
colonel
or
major
lamon
as
he
is
variously
styled
in
the
correspondence
did
not
return
to
charleston
as
promised
about
the
of
march
which
was
saturday
a
telegram
from
governor
pickens
was
received
by
the
commissioners
in
washington
making
inquiry
with
regard
to
colonel
lamon
and
the
meaning
of
the
protracted
delay
to
fulfill
the
promise
of
evacuation
this
was
fifteen
days
after
the
original
assurance
of
seward
that
the
garrison
would
be
withdrawn
immediately
and
ten
days
after
his
explanation
that
the
delay
was
accidental
the
dispatch
of
governor
pickens
was
taken
by
judge
campbell
to
seward
who
appointed
the
ensuing
monday
of
april
for
an
interview
and
answer
at
that
interview
seward
informed
judge
campbell
that
the
president
was
concerned
about
the
contents
of
the
telegram
was
a
point
of
honor
that
lamon
had
no
agency
from
him
nor
title
to
speak
this
late
suggestion
of
the
point
of
would
seem
under
the
circumstances
to
have
been
made
in
a
spirit
of
sarcastic
pleasantry
like
sir
john
falstaff
celebrated
discourse
on
the
same
subject
the
only
substantial
result
of
the
conversation
however
was
the
written
assurance
of
seward
to
be
communicated
to
the
commissioners
that
the
government
will
not
undertake
to
supply
fort
sumter
without
giving
notice
to
governor
pickens
this
it
will
be
observed
was
a
very
material
variation
from
the
positive
pledge
previously
given
and
reiterated
to
the
commissioners
to
governor
pickens
and
to
myself
directly
that
the
fort
was
to
be
forthwith
evacuated
judge
campbell
in
his
account
of
the
interview
says
i
asked
him
seward
whether
i
was
to
understand
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
his
former
communications
his
answer
was
about
the
close
of
the
same
week
the
first
in
april
the
patience
of
the
commissioners
having
now
been
wellnigh
exhausted
and
the
hostile
preparations
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
notwithstanding
the
secrecy
with
which
they
were
conducted
having
become
matter
of
general
rumor
a
letter
was
addressed
to
seward
upon
the
subject
by
judge
campbell
in
behalf
of
the
commissioners
again
asking
whether
the
assurances
so
often
given
were
well
or
ill
founded
to
this
the
secretary
returned
answer
in
writing
as
to
sumter
fully
kept
wait
and
this
was
on
the
of
april
the
very
next
day
the
the
following
official
notification
without
date
or
signature
was
read
to
governor
pickens
of
south
carolina
and
general
beauregard
in
charleston
by
chew
an
official
of
the
seward
in
washington
who
said
as
did
a
captain
or
lieutenant
talbot
who
accompanied
him
that
it
was
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
delivered
by
him
to
chew
on
the
the
day
seward
assurance
of
fully
i
am
directed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
notify
you
to
expect
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
supply
fort
sumter
with
provisions
only
and
that
if
such
an
attempt
be
not
resisted
no
effort
to
throw
in
men
arms
or
ammunition
will
be
made
without
further
notice
or
in
case
of
an
attack
upon
the
fort
thus
disappeared
the
last
vestige
of
the
plighted
faith
and
pacific
pledges
of
the
federal
government
in
order
fully
to
appreciate
the
significance
of
this
communication
and
of
the
time
and
circumstances
of
its
delivery
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
naval
expedition
which
had
been
secretly
in
preparation
for
some
time
at
new
york
under
direction
of
captain
fox
was
now
ready
to
sail
and
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
at
charleston
almost
immediately
after
the
notification
was
delivered
to
governor
pickens
and
before
preparation
could
be
made
to
receive
it
owing
to
or
misunderstandings
in
the
washington
cabinet
however
and
then
to
the
delay
caused
by
a
severe
storm
at
sea
this
expectation
was
disappointed
and
the
confederate
commander
at
charleston
had
opportunity
to
communicate
with
montgomery
and
receive
instructions
for
his
guidance
before
the
arrival
of
the
fleet
which
had
been
intended
to
be
a
surprise
in
publications
made
since
the
war
by
members
of
lincoln
cabinet
it
has
been
represented
that
during
the
period
of
the
disgraceful
transactions
above
detailed
there
were
dissensions
and
divisions
in
the
cabinet
certain
members
of
it
urging
measures
of
prompt
and
decided
coercion
the
secretary
of
state
favoring
a
pacific
or
at
least
a
dilatory
policy
and
the
president
vacillating
for
a
time
between
the
two
but
eventually
adopting
the
views
of
the
coercionists
in
these
statements
it
is
represented
that
the
assurances
and
pledges
given
by
seward
to
the
confederate
government
and
its
commissioners
were
given
on
his
own
authority
and
without
the
consent
or
approval
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
absurdity
of
any
such
attempt
to
disassociate
the
action
of
the
president
from
that
of
his
secretary
and
to
relieve
the
former
of
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
latter
is
too
evident
to
require
argument
or
comment
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
during
this
whole
period
of
nearly
a
month
lincoln
was
ignorant
of
the
communications
that
were
passing
between
the
confederate
commissioners
and
seward
through
the
distinguished
member
of
the
supreme
court
still
holding
his
seat
as
such
who
was
acting
as
intermediary
on
one
occasion
judge
campbell
informs
us
that
the
secretary
in
the
midst
of
an
important
interview
excused
himself
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
with
the
president
before
giving
a
final
answer
and
left
his
visitor
for
some
time
awaiting
his
return
from
that
conference
when
the
answer
was
given
avowedly
and
directly
proceeding
from
the
president
if
however
it
were
possible
to
suppose
that
seward
was
acting
on
his
own
responsibility
and
practicing
a
deception
upon
his
own
chief
as
well
as
upon
the
confederate
authorities
in
the
pledges
which
he
made
to
the
latter
it
is
nevertheless
certain
that
the
principal
facts
were
brought
to
light
within
a
few
days
after
the
close
of
the
efforts
at
negotiation
yet
the
secretary
of
state
was
not
impeached
and
brought
to
trial
for
the
grave
offense
of
undertaking
to
conduct
the
most
momentous
and
vital
transactions
that
had
been
or
could
be
brought
before
the
government
of
the
united
states
without
the
knowledge
and
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
the
president
and
for
having
involved
the
government
in
dishonor
if
not
in
disaster
he
was
not
even
dismissed
from
office
but
continued
to
be
the
chief
officer
of
the
cabinet
and
confidential
adviser
of
the
president
as
he
was
afterward
of
the
ensuing
administration
occupying
that
station
during
two
consecutive
terms
no
disavowal
of
his
action
no
apology
nor
explanation
was
ever
made
politically
and
legally
the
president
is
unquestionably
responsible
in
all
cases
for
the
action
of
any
member
of
his
cabinet
and
in
this
case
it
is
as
preposterous
to
attempt
to
dissever
from
him
the
moral
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
relieve
him
of
the
legal
responsibility
that
rests
upon
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
the
systematic
series
of
frauds
perpetrated
by
its
authority
on
the
other
hand
seward
throughout
the
whole
negotiation
was
fully
informed
of
the
views
of
his
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
and
of
the
president
whatever
his
real
hopes
or
purposes
may
have
been
in
the
beginning
it
is
positively
certain
that
long
before
the
end
and
while
still
reiterating
his
assurances
that
the
garrison
would
be
withdrawn
he
knew
that
it
had
been
and
that
active
preparations
were
in
progress
to
strengthen
it
gideon
welles
who
was
secretary
of
the
navy
in
cabinet
gives
the
following
account
of
one
of
the
transactions
of
the
period
one
evening
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
of
march
there
was
a
small
gathering
at
the
executive
mansion
while
the
sumter
question
was
still
pending
the
members
of
the
cabinet
were
soon
individually
and
quietly
invited
to
the
where
as
soon
as
assembled
the
president
informed
them
he
had
just
been
advised
by
general
scott
that
it
was
expedient
to
evacuate
fort
pickens
as
well
as
fort
sumter
which
last
was
assumed
at
military
headquarters
to
be
a
determined
fact
in
conformity
with
the
views
of
secretary
seward
and
the
a
brief
silence
followed
the
announcement
of
the
amazing
recommendation
of
general
scott
when
blair
who
had
been
much
annoyed
by
the
vacillating
course
of
the
in
regard
to
sumter
remarked
looking
earnestly
at
seward
that
it
was
evident
the
old
general
was
playing
politician
in
regard
to
both
sumter
and
pickens
for
it
was
not
possible
if
there
was
a
defense
for
the
rebels
to
take
pickens
and
the
administration
would
not
be
justified
if
it
listened
to
his
advice
and
evacuated
either
very
soon
thereafter
i
think
at
the
next
cabinet
meeting
the
president
announced
his
decision
that
should
be
sent
to
and
issued
confidential
orders
to
that
effect
all
were
gratified
with
this
decision
except
seward
who
still
remonstrated
preparations
were
immediately
commenced
to
fit
out
an
expedition
to
forward
this
account
is
confirmed
by
a
letter
of
montgomery
blair
the
date
of
the
announcement
of
the
president
final
purpose
is
fixed
by
welles
in
the
neat
paragraph
to
that
above
quoted
as
the
of
march
this
was
four
days
before
seward
assurance
given
judge
campbell
after
conference
with
the
president
that
there
would
be
no
departure
from
the
pledges
previously
given
which
were
that
the
fort
be
and
ten
days
before
his
written
renewal
of
the
assurance
as
to
sumter
fully
kept
wait
and
see
this
assurance
too
was
given
at
the
very
moment
when
a
messenger
from
his
own
department
was
on
the
way
to
charleston
to
notify
the
governor
of
south
carolina
that
faith
would
be
kept
in
the
matter
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
commissioners
had
with
good
reason
ceased
to
place
any
confidence
in
the
promises
of
the
united
states
government
before
they
ceased
to
be
made
on
the
of
april
they
sent
the
following
dispatch
to
general
beauregard
washington

accounts
uncertain
because
of
the
constant
vacillation
of
this
government
we
were
reassured
yesterday
that
the
status
of
sumter
would
not
be
changed
without
previous
notice
to
governor
pickens
but
we
have
no
faith
in
them
the
war
policy
prevails
in
the
cabinet
at
this
time
j
crawford
on
the
same
day
the
announcement
made
to
governor
pickens
through
chew
was
made
known
the
commissioners
immediately
applied
for
a
definitive
answer
to
their
note
of
march
which
had
been
permitted
to
remain
in
abeyance
the
paper
of
the
secretary
of
state
dated
march
was
thereupon
delivered
to
them
this
paper
with
the
final
rejoinder
of
the
commissioners
and
judge
campbell
letters
to
the
secretary
of
april
and
april
respectively
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
negotiation
was
now
at
an
end
and
the
commissioners
withdrew
from
washington
and
returned
to
their
homes
their
last
dispatch
before
leaving
shows
that
they
were
still
dependent
upon
public
rumor
and
the
newspapers
for
information
as
to
the
real
purposes
and
preparations
of
the
federal
administration
it
was
in
these
words
washington

the
of

the

object
of

to
be

the
annexed
extracts
from
my
message
to
the
confederate
congress
at
the
opening
of
its
special
session
on
the
of
april
will
serve
as
a
recapitulation
of
the
events
above
narrated
with
all
of
comment
that
it
was
then
or
is
now
considered
necessary
to
add
from
president
message
to
the
confederate
congress
of
april
scarce
had
you
assembled
in
february
last
when
prior
even
to
the
inauguration
of
the
chief
magistrate
you
had
elected
you
expressed
your
desire
for
the
appointment
of
commissioners
and
for
the
settlement
of
all
questions
of
disagreement
between
the
two
governments
upon
principles
of
right
justice
equity
and
good
faith
it
was
my
pleasure
as
well
as
my
duty
to
coöperate
with
you
in
this
work
of
peace
indeed
in
my
address
to
you
on
taking
the
oath
of
office
and
before
receiving
from
you
the
communication
of
this
resolution
i
had
said
that
as
a
necessity
not
as
a
choice
we
have
resorted
to
the
remedy
of
separating
and
henceforth
our
energies
must
be
directed
to
the
conduct
of
our
own
affairs
and
the
perpetuity
of
the
confederacy
which
we
have
formed
if
a
just
perception
of
mutual
interest
shall
permit
us
to
peaceably
pursue
our
separate
political
career
my
most
earnest
desire
will
then
have
been
fulfilled
it
was
in
furtherance
of
these
accordant
views
of
the
congress
and
the
executive
that
i
made
choice
of
three
discreet
able
and
distinguished
citizens
who
repaired
to
washington
aided
by
their
cordial
coöperation
and
that
of
the
secretary
of
state
every
effort
compatible
with
and
the
dignity
of
the
confederacy
was
exhausted
before
i
allowed
myself
to
yield
to
the
conviction
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
determined
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
this
people
and
that
our
cherished
hopes
of
peace
were
unobtainable
on
the
arrival
of
our
commissioners
in
washington
on
the
of
march
they
postponed
at
the
suggestion
of
a
friendly
intermediator
doing
more
than
giving
informal
notice
of
their
arrival
this
was
done
with
a
view
to
afford
time
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
who
had
just
been
inaugurated
for
the
discharge
of
other
pressing
official
duties
in
the
organization
of
his
administration
before
engaging
his
attention
to
the
object
of
their
mission
it
was
not
until
the
of
the
month
that
they
officially
addressed
the
secretary
of
state
informing
him
of
the
purpose
of
their
arrival
and
stating
in
the
language
of
their
instructions
their
wish
to
make
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
overtures
for
the
opening
of
negotiations
assuring
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
the
president
congress
and
people
of
the
confederate
states
desired
a
peaceful
solution
of
these
great
questions
that
it
was
neither
their
interest
nor
their
wish
to
make
any
demand
which
was
not
founded
on
the
strictest
principles
of
justice
nor
to
do
any
act
to
injure
their
late
confederates
to
this
communication
no
formal
reply
was
received
until
the
of
april
during
the
interval
the
commissioners
had
consented
to
waive
all
questions
of
form
with
the
firm
resolve
to
avoid
war
if
possible
they
went
so
far
even
as
to
hold
during
that
long
period
unofficial
intercourse
through
an
intermediary
whose
high
position
and
character
inspired
the
hope
of
success
and
through
whom
constant
assurances
were
received
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
its
peaceful
intentions
of
its
determination
to
evacuate
fort
sumter
and
further
that
no
measure
would
be
introduced
changing
the
existing
status
prejudicial
to
the
confederate
states
that
in
the
event
of
any
change
in
regard
to
fort
pickens
notice
would
be
given
to
the
commissioners
the
crooked
path
of
diplomacy
can
scarcely
furnish
an
example
so
wanting
in
courtesy
in
candor
and
directness
as
was
the
course
of
the
united
states
government
toward
our
commissioners
in
washington
for
proof
of
this
i
refer
to
the
annexed
documents
marked
taken
in
connection
with
further
facts
which
i
now
proceed
to
relate
early
in
april
the
attention
of
the
whole
country
was
attracted
to
extraordinary
preparations
in
new
york
and
other
northern
ports
for
an
extensive
military
and
naval
expedition
these
preparations
were
commenced
in
secrecy
for
an
expedition
whose
destination
was
concealed
and
only
became
known
when
nearly
completed
and
on
the
and
of
april
transports
and
vessels
of
war
with
troops
munitions
and
military
supplies
sailed
from
northern
ports

alarmed
by
so
extraordinary
a
demonstration
the
commissioners
requested
the
delivery
of
an
answer
to
their
official
communication
of
the
of
march
and
the
reply
dated
on
the
of
the
previous
month
was
obtained
from
which
it
appears
that
during
the
whole
interval
while
the
commissioners
were
receiving
assurances
calculated
to
inspire
hope
of
the
success
of
their
mission
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
already
determined
to
hold
no
intercourse
with
them
whatever
to
refuse
even
to
listen
to
any
proposals
they
had
to
make
and
had
profited
by
the
delay
created
by
their
own
assurances
in
order
to
prepare
secretly
the
means
for
effective
hostile
operations
that
these
assurances
were
given
has
been
virtually
confessed
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
its
act
of
sending
a
messenger
to
charleston
to
give
notice
of
its
purpose
to
use
force
if
opposed
in
its
intention
of
supplying
fort
sumter
no
more
striking
proof
of
the
absence
of
good
faith
in
the
conduct
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
toward
the
confederacy
can
be
required
than
is
contained
in
the
circumstances
which
accompanied
this
notice

to
the
usual
course
of
navigation
the
vessels
composing
the
expedition
and
designed
for
the
relief
of
fort
sumter
might
be
looked
for
in

harbor
on
the
of

yet
our
commissioners
in
washington
were
detained
under
assurances
that
notice
should
be
given
of
any
military
movement
the
notice
was
not
addressed
to
them
but
a
messenger
was
sent
to
charleston
to
give
notice
to
the
governor
of
south
carolina
and
the
notice
was
so
given
at
a
late
hour
on
the
of
april
the
eve
of
the
very
day
on
which
the
fleet
might
be
expected
to
arrive
that
this
manoeuvre
failed
in
its
purpose
was
not
the
fault
of
those
who
controlled
it
a
heavy
tempest
delayed
the
arrival
of
the

gave
time
to

ask

with

had
not
passed
without
earnest
remonstrance
from
the
most
intelligent
and
patriotic
of
its
own
friends
during
the
period
of
the
events
which
constitute
the
subject
of
the
preceding
chapter
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
which
continued
in
executive
session
for
several
weeks
after
the
inauguration
of
lincoln
it
was
the
subject
of
discussion
douglas
of
illinois
who
was
certainly
not
suspected
of
sympathy
with
secession
or
lack
of
devotion
to
the
union
on
the
of
march
offered
a
resolution
recommending
the
withdrawal
of
the
garrisons
from
all
forts
within
the
limits
of
the
states
which
had
seceded
except
those
at
key
west
and
the
dry
tortugas
in
support
of
this
resolution
he
said
we
certainly
can
not
justify
the
holding
of
forts
there
much
less
the
recapturing
of
those
which
have
been
taken
unless
we
intend
to
reduce
those
states
themselves
into
subjection
i
take
it
for
granted
no
man
will
deny
the
proposition
that
whoever
permanently
holds
charleston
and
south
carolina
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
fort
sumter
whoever
permanently
holds
pensacola
and
florida
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
fort
pickens
whoever
holds
the
states
in
whose
limits
those
forts
are
placed
is
entitled
to
the
forts
themselves
unless
there
is
something
peculiar
in
the
location
of
some
particular
fort
that
makes
it
important
for
us
to
hold
it
for
the
general
defense
of
the
whole
country
its
commerce
and
interests
instead
of
being
useful
only
for
the
defense
of
a
particular
city
or
locality
it
is
true
that
forts
taylor
and
jefferson
at
key
west
and
tortugas
are
so
situated
as
to
be
essentially
national
and
therefore
important
to
us
without
reference
to
our
relations
with
the
seceded
states
not
so
with
moultrie
johnson
castle
pinckney
and
sumter
in
charleston
harbor
not
so
with
pulaski
on
the
savannah
river
not
so
with
morgan
and
other
forts
in
alabama
not
so
with
those
other
forts
that
were
intended
to
guard
the
entrance
of
a
particular
harbor
for
local
defense
we
can
not
deny
that
there
is
a
southern
confederacy
in
existence
with
its
capital
at
montgomery
we
may
regret
it
regret
it
most
profoundly
but
i
can
not
deny
the
truth
of
the
fact
painful
and
mortifying
as
it
is
i
proclaim
boldly
the
policy
of
those
with
whom
i
act
we
are
for
peace
douglas
in
urging
the
maintenance
of
as
a
motive
for
the
evacuation
of
the
forts
was
no
doubt
aware
of
the
full
force
of
his
words
he
knew
that
their
continued
occupation
was
virtually
a
declaration
of
war
the
of
the
united
states
army
also
it
is
well
known
urgently
advised
the
evacuation
of
the
forts
but
the
most
striking
protest
against
the
coercive
measures
finally
adopted
was
that
of
major
anderson
himself
the
letter
in
which
his
views
were
expressed
has
been
carefully
suppressed
in
the
partisan
narratives
of
that
period
and
wellnigh
lost
sight
of
although
it
does
the
highest
honor
to
his
patriotism
and
integrity
it
was
written
on
the
same
day
on
which
the
announcement
was
made
to
governor
pickens
of
the
purpose
of
the
united
states
government
to
send
supplies
to
the
fort

colonel
i
have
the
honor
to
report
that
the
resumption
of
work
yesterday
sunday
at
various
points
on
morris
island
and
the
vigorous
prosecution
of
it
this
morning
apparently
strengthening
all
the
batteries
which
are
under
the
fire
of
our
guns
shows
that
they
either
have
just
received
some
news
from
washington
which
has
put
them
on
the
or
that
they
have
received
orders
from
montgomery
to
commence
operations
here
i
am
preparing
by
the
side
of
my
barbette
guns
protection
for
our
men
from
the
shells
which
will
be
almost
continually
bursting
over
or
in
our
work
i
had
the
honor
to
receive
by
yesterday
mail
the
letter
of
the
honorable
secretary
of
war
dated
april
and
confess
that
what
he
there
states
surprises
me
very
greatly
following
as
it
does
and
contradicting
so
positively
the
assurance
crawford
telegraphed
he
was
to
make
i
trust
that
this
matter
will
be
at
once
put
in
a
correct
light
as
a
movement
made
now
when
the
south
has
been
erroneously
informed
that
none
such
would
be
attempted
would
produce
most
disastrous
results
throughout
our
country
it
is
of
course
now
too
late
for
me
to
give
any
advice
in
reference
to
the
proposed
scheme
of
captain
fox
i
fear
that
its
result
can
not
fail
to
be
disastrous
to
all
concerned
even
with
his
boat
at
our
walls
the
loss
of
life
as
i
think
i
mentioned
to
fox
in
unloading
her
will
more
than
pay
for
the
good
to
be
accomplished
by
the
expedition
which
keeps
us
if
i
can
maintain
possession
of
this
work
out
of
position
surrounded
by
strong
works
which
must
be
carried
to
make
this
fort
of
the
least
value
to
the
united
states
government
we
have
not
oil
enough
to
keep
a
light
in
the
lantern
for
one
night
the
boats
will
have
to
therefore
rely
at
night
entirely
upon
other
marks
i
ought
to
have
been
informed
that
this
expedition
was
to
come
colonel
lamon
remark
convinced
me
that
the
idea
merely
hinted
at
to
me
by
captain
fox
would
not
be
carried
out
we
shall
strive
to
do
our
duty
though
i
frankly
say
that
my
heart
is
not
in
this
war
which
i
see
is
to
be
thus
commenced
that
god
will
still
avert
it
and
cause
us
to
resort
to
pacific
means
to
maintain
our
rights
is
my
ardent
prayer
i
am
colonel
very
respectfully
your
obedient

artillery
this
frank
and
manly
letter
although
written
with
the
reserve
necessarily
belonging
to
a
communication
from
an
officer
to
his
military
superiors
expressing
dissatisfaction
with
orders
fully
vindicates
major
anderson
from
all
suspicion
of
complicity
or
sympathy
with
the
bad
faith
of
the
government
which
he
was
serving
it
accords
entirely
with
the
sentiments
expressed
in
his
private
letter
to
me
already
mentioned
as
lost
or
stolen
and
exhibits
him
in
the
attitude
of
faithful
performance
of
a
duty
inconsistent
with
his
domestic
ties
and
repugnant
to
his
patriotism
the
relief
squadron
as
with
unconscious
irony
it
was
termed
was
already
under
way
for
charleston
consisting
according
to
their
own
statement
of
eight
vessels
carrying
guns
and
about
fourteen
hundred
men
including
the
troops
sent
for
reënforcement
of
the
garrison
these
facts
became
known
to
the
confederate
government
and
it
was
obvious
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
preparing
for
and
if
possible
anticipating
the
impending
assault
the
character
of
the
instructions
given
general
beauregard
in
this
emergency
may
be
inferred
from
the
ensuing
correspondence
which
is
here
reproduced
from
contemporary
publications
charleston
walker
of
an
authorized
messenger
from
president
lincoln
just
informed

sir
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
has
hitherto
forborne
from
any
hostile
demonstration
against
fort
sumter
in
the
hope
that
the

of
the
united
states
with
a
view
to
the
amicable
adjustment
of
all
questions
between
the
two
governments
and
to
avert
the
calamities
of

would
voluntarily
evacuate
it

at
one
time
to
believe
that
such
would
be
the
course
pursued
by
the
government
of

and
under
that
impression
my
government
has
refrained
from
making
any
demand
for
the
surrender
of

no
longer
delay

he

so

as
it
was
known
to
the

that
the

were
already
issued
and
that
the
additional

were
momentarily
expected

also
as
any

would
compel
the

upon

bearing
them

thereby
releasing
major
anderson
from

it
is
evident
that

it
would
have
been
merely
after
the
avowal
of
a
hostile
determination
by

we
may
pause
for

contemplate
the

of

to
the

and
the
grounds
on
which
they

stand
i
do

refer

causes
of

to
the
comparative
claims
of
statehood
and
union
or
to
the
question
of
the
right
or
the
wrong
of
secession
but
to
the
proximate
and
immediate
causes
of
conflict
the
fact
that
south
carolina
a
state
whatever
her
relations
may
have
been
to
the
other
states
is
not
and
can
not
be
denied
it
is
equally
undeniable
that
the
ground
on
which
fort
sumter
was
built
was
ceded
by
south
carolina
to
the
united
states
for
the
defense
of
her
own
soil
and
her
own
chief
harbor
this
has
been
shown
by
ample
evidence
to
have
been
the
principle
governing
all
cessions
by
the
states
of
sites
for
military
purposes
but
it
applies
with
special
force
to
the
case
of
charleston
the
streams
flowing
into
that
harbor
from
source
to
mouth
lie
entirely
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
no
other
state
or
combination
of
states
could
have
any
distinct
interest
or
concern
in
the
maintenance
of
a
fortress
at
that
point
unless
as
a
means
of
aggression
against
south
carolina
herself
the
practical
view
of
the
case
was
correctly
stated
by
douglas
when
he
said
i
take
it
for
granted
that
whoever
permanently
holds
charleston
and
south
carolina
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
fort
sumter
whoever
permanently
holds
pensacola
and
florida
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
fort
pickens
whoever
holds
the
states
in
whose
limits
those
forts
are
placed
is
entitled
to
the
forts
themselves
unless
there
is
something
peculiar
in
the
location
of
some
particular
fort
that
makes
it
important
for
us
to
hold
it
for
the
general
defense
of
the
whole
country
its
commerce
and
interests
instead
of
being
useful
only
for
the
defense
of
a
particular
city
or
locality
no
such
necessity
could
be
alleged
with
regard
to
fort
sumter
the
claim
to
hold
it
as
public
property
of
the
united
states
was
utterly
untenable
and
unmeaning
apart
from
a
claim
of
coercive
control
over
the
state
if
south
carolina
was
a
mere
province
in
a
state
of
open
rebellion
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
retain
its
hold
of
any
fortified
place
within
her
limits
which
happened
to
be
in
its
possession
and
it
would
have
had
an
equal
right
to
acquire
possession
of
any
other
it
would
have
had
the
same
right
to
send
an
army
to
columbia
to
batter
down
the
walls
of
the
state
capitol
the
subject
may
at
once
be
stripped
of
the
sophistry
which
would
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
cases
the
one
was
as
really
an
act
of
war
as
the
other
would
have
been
the
right
or
the
wrong
of
either
depended
entirely
upon
the
question
of
the
rightful
power
of
the
federal
government
to
coerce
a
state
into
submission
a
power
which
as
we
have
seen
was
unanimously
rejected
in
the
formation
of
the
federal
constitution
and
which
was
still
unrecognized
by
many
perhaps
by
a
majority
even
of
those
who
denied
the
right
of
a
state
to
secede
if
there
existed
any
hope
or
desire
for
a
peaceful
settlement
of
the
questions
at
issue
between
the
states
either
party
had
a
right
to
demand
that
pending
such
settlement
there
should
be
no
hostile
grasp
upon
its
throat
this
grip
had
been
held
on
the
throat
of
south
carolina
for
almost
four
months
from
the
period
of
her
secession
and
no
forcible
resistance
to
it
had
yet
been
made
remonstrances
and
patient
persistent
and
reiterated
attempts
at
negotiation
for
its
removal
had
been
made
with
two
successive
administrations
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
first
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
by
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
after
its
formation
these
efforts
had
been
met
not
by
an
open
avowal
of
coercive
purposes
but
by
evasion
prevarication
and
perfidy
the
agreement
of
one
administration
to
maintain
the
at
the
time
when
the
question
arose
was
violated
in
december
by
the
removal
of
the
garrison
from
its
original
position
to
the
occupancy
of
a
stronger
another
attempt
was
made
to
violate
it
in
january
by
the
introduction
of
troops
concealed
below
the
deck
of
the
steamer
star
of
the
west
but
this
was
thwarted
by
the
vigilance
of
the
state
service
the
protracted
course
of
fraud
and
prevarication
practiced
by
lincoln
administration
in
the
months
of
march
and
april
has
been
fully
exhibited
it
was
evident
that
no
confidence
whatever
could
be
reposed
in
any
pledge
or
promise
of
the
federal
government
as
then
administered
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
no
resistance
other
than
that
of
pacific
protest
and
appeals
for
an
equitable
settlement
was
made
until
after
the
avowal
of
a
purpose
of
coercion
and
when
it
was
known
that
a
hostile
fleet
was
on
the
way
to
support
and
enforce
it
at
the
very
moment
when
the
confederate
commander
gave
the
final
notice
to
major
anderson
of
his
purpose
to
open
fire
upon
the
fort
that
fleet
was
lying
off
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
hindered
from
entering
only
by
a
gale
of
wind
the
forbearance
of
the
confederate
government
under
the
circumstances
is
perhaps
unexampled
in
history
it
was
carried
to
the
extreme
verge
short
of
a
disregard
of
the
safety
of
the
people
who
had
intrusted
to
that
government
the
duty
of
their
defense
against
their
enemies
the
attempt
to
represent
us
as
the
in
the
conflict
which
ensued
is
as
unfounded
as
the
complaint
made
by
the
wolf
against
the
lamb
in
the
familiar
fable
he
who
makes
the
assault
is
not
necessarily
he
that
strikes
the
first
blow
or
fires
the
first
gun
to
have
awaited
further
strengthening
of
their
position
by
land
and
naval
forces
with
hostile
purpose
now
declared
for
the
sake
of
having
them
fire
the
first
gun
would
have
been
as
unwise
as
it
would
be
to
hesitate
to
strike
down
the
arm
of
the
assailant
who
levels
a
deadly
weapon
at
one
breast
until
he
has
actually
fired
the
disingenuous
rant
of
demagogues
about
firing
on
the
flag
might
serve
to
rouse
the
passions
of
insensate
mobs
in
times
of
general
excitement
but
will
be
impotent
in
impartial
history
to
relieve
the
federal
government
from
the
responsibility
of
the
assault
made
by
sending
a
hostile
fleet
against
the
harbor
of
charleston
to
coöperate
with
the
menacing
garrison
of
fort
sumter
after
the
assault
was
made
by
the
hostile
descent
of
the
fleet
the
reduction
of
fort
sumter
was
a
measure
of
defense
rendered
absolutely
and
immediately
necessary
such
clearly
was
the
idea
of
the
commander
of
the
pawnee
when
he
declined
as
captain
fox
informs
us
without
orders
from
a
superior
to
make
any
effort
to
enter
the
harbor
there
to
inaugurate
civil
war
the
straightforward
simplicity
of
the
sailor
had
not
been
perverted
by
the
shams
of
political
sophistry
even
horace
greeley
with
all
his
extreme
partisan
feeling
is
obliged
to
admit
that
whether
the
bombardment
and
reduction
of
fort
sumter
shall
or
shall
not
be
justified
by
posterity
it
is
clear
that
the
confederacy
had
no
alternative
but
its
own
dissolution
according
to
the
notice
given
by
general
beauregard
fire
was
opened
upon
fort
sumter
from
the
various
batteries
which
had
been
erected
around
the
harbor
at
four
on
the
morning
of
friday
the
of
april
the
fort
soon
responded
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
work
to
give
minute
details
of
the
military
operation
as
the
events
of
the
bombardment
have
been
often
related
and
are
generally
well
known
with
no
material
discrepancy
in
matters
of
fact
among
the
statements
of
the
various
participants
it
is
enough
therefore
to
add
that
the
bombardment
continued
for
about
or
hours
the
fort
was
eventually
set
on
fire
by
shells
after
having
been
partly
destroyed
by
shot
and
major
anderson
after
a
resolute
defense
finally
surrendered
on
the
the
same
terms
being
accorded
to
him
which
had
been
offered
two
days
before
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
probably
without
precedent
in
the
annals
of
war
that
notwithstanding
the
extent
and
magnitude
of
the
engagement
the
number
and
caliber
of
the
guns
and
the
amount
of
damage
done
to
inanimate
material
on
both
sides
especially
to
fort
sumter
nobody
was
injured
on
either
side
by
the
bombardment
the
only
casualty
attendant
upon
the
affair
was
the
death
of
one
man
and
the
wounding
of
several
others
by
the
explosion
of
a
gun
in
the
firing
of
a
salute
to
their
flag
by
the
garrison
on
evacuating
the
fort
the
day
after
the
surrender
a
striking
incident
marked
the
close
of
the
bombardment
louis
wigfall
of
texas
a
man
as
generous
as
he
was
recklessly
brave
when
he
saw
the
fort
on
fire
supposing
the
garrison
to
be
hopelessly
struggling
for
the
honor
of
its
flag
voluntarily
and
without
authority
went
under
fire
in
an
open
boat
to
the
fort
and
climbing
through
one
of
its
embrasures
asked
for
major
anderson
and
insisted
that
he
should
surrender
a
fort
which
it
was
palpably
impossible
that
he
could
hold
major
anderson
agreed
to
surrender
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
that
had
been
offered
him
before
his
works
were
battered
in
breach
and
the
agreement
between
them
to
that
effect
was
promptly
ratified
by
the
confederate
commander
thus
unofficially
was
inaugurated
the
surrender
and
evacuation
of
the
fort
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
his
message
of
july
to
the
federal
congress
convened
in
extra
session
said
it
is
thus
seen
that
the
assault
upon
and
reduction
of
fort
sumter
was
in
no
sense
a
matter
of
on
the
part
of
the
assailants
they
well
knew
that
the
garrison
in
the
fort
could
by
no
possibility
commit
aggression
upon
them
they
knew
they
were
expressly
notified
that
the
giving
of
bread
to
the
few
brave
and
hungry
men
of
the
garrison
was
all
which
would
on
that
occasion
be
attempted
unless
themselves
by
resisting
so
much
should
provoke
more
lincoln
well
knew
that
if
the
brave
men
of
the
garrison
were
hungry
they
had
only
him
and
his
trusted
advisers
to
thank
for
it
they
had
been
kept
for
months
in
a
place
where
they
ought
not
to
have
been
contrary
to
the
judgment
of
the
of
his
army
contrary
to
the
counsels
of
the
wisest
statesmen
in
his
confidence
and
the
protests
of
the
commander
of
the
garrison
a
word
from
him
would
have
relieved
them
at
any
moment
in
the
manner
most
acceptable
to
them
and
most
promotive
of
peaceful
results
but
suppose
the
confederate
authorities
had
been
disposed
to
yield
and
to
consent
to
the
introduction
of
supplies
for
the
maintenance
of
the
garrison
what
assurance
would
they
have
had
that
nothing
further
would
be
attempted
what
reliance
could
be
placed
in
any
assurances
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
after
the
experience
of
the
attempted
of
the
star
of
the
west
and
the
deceptions
practiced
upon
the
confederate
commissioners
in
washington
he
says
we
were
expressly
notified
that
nothing
more
would
that
be
attempted
the
words
in
italics
themselves
constituting
a
very
significant
though
unobtrusive
and
limitation
but
we
had
been
just
as
expressly
notified
long
before
that
the
garrison
would
be
withdrawn
it
would
be
as
easy
to
violate
the
one
pledge
as
it
had
been
to

bombardment

commanding

those

believed
it

been

yet
when
instead
of
the
fulfillment
of
just
expectations
instead
of
the
withdrawal
of

a
hostile
expedition
was
organized

sent

reënforced
had
there
been
delay
the
more
serious
conflict
between

land

would
scarcely
have
been
bloodless
as
the
bombardment
fortunately
was
the
event
however
was
seized
upon
to
inflame
the
mind
of
the
northern
people
and
the
disguise
which
had
been
worn
in
the
communications
with
the
confederate
commissioners
was
now
thrown
off
and
it
was
cunningly
attempted
to
show
that
the
south
which
had
been
pleading
for
peace
and
still
stood
on
the
defensive
had
by
this
bombardment
inaugurated
a
war
against
the
united
states
but
it
should
be
stated
that
the
threats
implied
in
the
declarations
that
the
union
could
not
exist
part
slave
and
part
free
and
that
the
union
should
be
preserved
and
the
denial
of
the
right
of
a
state
peaceably
to
withdraw
were
virtually
a
declaration
of
war
and
the
sending
of
an
army
and
navy
to
attack
was
the
result
to
have
been
anticipated
as
the
consequence
of
such
declaration
of
war
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
president
lincoln
introducing
his
farce
of
combinations
too
powerful
to
be
suppressed
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
called
forth
the
military
of
the
several
states
to
the
number
of
thousand
and
commanded
the
persons
composing
the
combinations
to
disperse
etc
it
can
but
surprise
any
one
in
the
least
degree
conversant
with
the
history
of
the
union
to
find
states
referred
to
as
persons
composing
combinations
and
that
the
sovereign
creators
of
the
federal
government
the
states
of
the
union
should
be
commanded
by
their
agent
to
disperse
the
levy
of
so
large
an
army
could
only
mean
war
but
the
power
to
declare
war
did
not
reside
in
the
president
it
was
delegated
to
the
congress
only
if
however
it
had
been
a
riotous
combination
or
an
insurrection
it
must
have
been
according
to
the
constitution
against
the
state
and
the
power
of
the
president
to
call
forth
the
militia
to
suppress
it
was
dependent
upon
an
application
from
the
state
for
that
purpose
it
could
not
precede
such
application
and
still
less
could
it
be
rightfully
exercised
against
the
will
of
a
state
the
authorities
on
this
subject
have
been
heretofore
cited
and
need
not
be
referred
to
again
suffice
it
to
say
that
by
section
article
iv
of
the
constitution
the
united
states
are
bound
to
protect
each
state
against
invasion
and
against
domestic
violence
whenever
application
shall
have
been
made
by
the
legislature
or
by
the
executive
when
the
legislature
can
not
be
convened
and
that
to
fail
to
give
protection
against
any
invasion
whatsoever
would
be
a
dereliction
of
duty
to
add
that
there
could
be
no
justification
for
the
invasion
of
a
state
by
an
army
of
the
united
states
is
but
to
repeat
what
has
been
said
on
the
absence
of
any
authority
in
the
general
government
to
coerce
a
state
in
any
possible
view
of
the
case
therefore
the
conclusion
must
be
that
the
calling
on
some
of
the
states
for
thousand
militia
to
invade
other
states
which
were
asserted
to
be
still
in
the
union
was
a
palpable
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
usurpation
of
undelegated
power
or
in
other
words
of
power
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people
it
might
therefore
have
been
anticipated
that
virginia
one
of
whose
sons
wrote
the
declaration
of
independence
another
of
whose
sons
led
the
armies
of
the
united
states
in
the
revolution
which
achieved
their
independence
and
another
of
whose
sons
mainly
contributed
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
of
the
union
would
not
have
been
slow
in
the
face
of
such
events
to
reclaim
the
grants
she
had
made
to
the
general
government
and
to
withdraw
from
the
union
to
the
establishment
of
which
she
had
so
largely
contributed
two
days
had
elapsed
between
the
surrender
of
fort
sumter
and
the
proclamation
of
president
lincoln
calling
for
thousand
militia
as
before
stated
two
other
days
elapsed
and
virginia
passed
her
ordinance
of
secession
and
two
days
thereafter
the
citizens
of
baltimore
resisted
the
passage
of
troops
through
that
city
on
their
way
to
make
war
upon
the
southern
states
thus
rapidly
did
the
current
of
events
bear
us
onward
from
peace
to
the
desolating
war
which
was
soon
to
ensue
the
manly
effort
of
the
unorganized
unarmed
citizens
of
baltimore
to
resist
the
progress
of
armies
for
the
invasion
of
her
southern
sisters
was
worthy
of
the
fair
fame
of
maryland
becoming
the
descendants
of
the
men
who
so
gallantly
fought
for
the
freedom
independence
and
sovereignty
of
the
states
the
bold
stand
then
and
thereafter
taken
extorted
a
promise
from
the
executive
authorities
that
no
more
troops
should
be
sent
through
the
city
of
baltimore
which
promise
however
was
only
observed
until
by
artifice
power
had
been
gained
to
disregard
it
virginia
as
has
been
heretofore
stated
passed
her
ordinance
of
secession
on
the
of
april
it
was
however
subject
to
ratification
by
the
people
at
an
election
to
be
held
on
the
fourth
thursday
of
may
she
was
in
the
mean
time
like
her
southern
sisters
the
object
of
northern
hostilities
and
having
a
common
cause
with
them
properly
anticipated
the
election
of
may
by
forming
an
alliance
with
the
confederate
states
which
was
ratified
by
the
convention
on
the
of
april
the
convention
for
that
alliance
set
forth
that
virginia
looking
to
a
speedy
union
with
the
confederate
states
and
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
pressing
exigencies
agreed
that
the
whole
military
force
and
military
operations
offensive
and
defensive
of
said
commonwealth
in
the
impending
conflict
with
the
united
states
shall
be
under
the
chief
control
and
direction
of
the
president
of
the
said
confederate
states
the
whole
was
made
subject
to
the
approval
and
ratification
of
the
proper
authorities
of
both
governments
respectively
to
those
who
criticise
south
carolina
as
having
acted
precipitately
in
withdrawing
from
the
union
it
may
be
answered
that
intervening
occurrences
show
that
her
delay
could
not
have
changed
the
result
and
further
that
her
prompt
action
had
enabled
her
better
to
prepare
for
the
contingency
which
it
was
found
impossible
to
avert
thus
she
was
prepared
in
the
first
necessities
of
virginia
to
send
to
her
troops
organized
and
equipped
before
the
convention
for
coöperation
with
the
confederate
states
had
been
adopted
by
virginia
that
knightly
soldier
general
bonham
of
south
carolina
went
with
his
brigade
to
richmond
and
throughout
the
southern
states
there
was
a
prevailing
desire
to
rush
to
virginia
where
it
was
foreseen
that
the
first
great
battles
of
the
war
were
to
be
fought
so
that
as
early
as
the
of
april
i
telegraphed
to
governor
letcher
that
in
addition
to
the
forces
heretofore
ordered
requisitions
had
been
made
for
thirteen
regiments
eight
to
rendezvous
at
lynchburg
four
at
richmond
and
one
at
harper
ferry
referring
to
an
application
that
had
been
made
to
him
from
baltimore
i
wrote
sustain
baltimore
if
practicable
we
will
reënforce
you
the
universal
feeling
was
that
of
a
common
cause
and
common
destiny
there
was
no
selfish
desire
to
linger
around
home
no
narrow
purpose
to
separate
local
interests
from
the
common
welfare
the
object
was
to
sustain
a
principle
the
broad
principle
of
constitutional
liberty
the
right
of
the
early
demonstrations
of
the
enemy
showed
that
virginia
was
liable
to
invasion
from
the
north
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
though
the
larger
preparation
indicated
that
the
most
serious
danger
to
be
apprehended
was
from
the
line

the

for
which
it
was
the
most
difficult
to
provide
of
men
willing
to
engage
in

country
there
were
many
more
than
we
could
arm
though
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
the
southern
people
was
a
cordial
attachment
to
the
union
as
it
was
formed
by
their
fathers
their
love
was
for
the
spirit
of
the
compact
for

liberties
it
was
designed
to
secure
for
the
and

which
had
been
won
by
separation
from
the
and
transmitted
to
them
by
their
revolutionary
sires
as
a
legacy
for
their
posterity
for
ever
the
number
of
those
who
desired
to
dissolve
the
union
even
though
the
constitution
should
be
faithfully
observed
those
who
in
the
language
of
the
day
were
called
secessionists
was
so
small
as
not
to
be
felt
in
any
popular
decision
but
the
number
of
those
who
held
that
the
states
had
surrendered
their
sovereignty
and
had
no
right
to
secede
from
the
union
was
so
inappreciably
small
if
indeed
any
such
existed
that
i
can
not
recall
the
fact
of
a
single
southern
advocate
of
that
opinion
the
assertion
of
the
right
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
a
readiness
to
exercise
it
many
who
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
right
looked
upon
its
exercise
with
reluctance
amounting
to
sorrow
and
claimed
that
it
should
be
the
last
resort
only
to
be
adopted
as
the
alternative
to
a
surrender
of
the
equality
in
the
union
of
states
free
sovereign
and
independent
of
that
class
forming
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
mississippi
i
may
speak
with
the
confidence
of
one
who
belonged
to
it
thus
after
the
legislature
of
mississippi
had
enacted
a
law
for
a
convention
which
representing
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
should
consider
the
propriety
of
passing
an
ordinance
to
reassume
the
grants
made
to
the
general
government
and
withdraw
from
the
union
i
as
a
united
states
senator
of
mississippi
retained
my
position
in
the
senate
and
sought
by
every
practicable
mode
to
obtain
such
measures
as
would
allay
the
excitement
and
afford
to
the
south
such
security
as
would
prevent
the
final
step
the
ordinance
of
secession
from
the
union
when
the
last
hope
of
preserving
the
union
of
the
constitution
was
extinguished
and
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
enacted
by
the
convention
of
mississippi
which
was
the
highest
authority
known
under
our
form
of
government
the
question
of
the
expediency
of
adopting
that
remedy
was
no
longer
open
to
inquiry
by
one
who
acknowledged
his
allegiance
as
due
to
the
state
of
which
he
was
a
citizen
to
evade
the
responsibilities
resulting
from
the
decree
of
his
sovereign
the
people
would
be
craven
to
resist
it
would
be
treason
the
instincts
and
affections
of
the
citizens
of
mississippi
led
them
with
great
unanimity
to
the
duty
of
maintaining
and
defending
their
state
without
pausing
to
ask
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
refusing
obedience
to
its
mandate
a
like
feeling
pervaded
all
of
the
seceding
states
and
it
was
not
only
for
the
military
service
but
for
every
service
which
would
strengthen
and
sustain
the
confederacy
that
an
enthusiasm
pervading
all
classes
sexes
and
ages
was
manifested
though
our
agricultural
products
had
been
mainly
for
export
insomuch
that
in
the
planting
states
the
necessary
were
to
a
considerable
extent
imported
from
the
west
and
it
would
require
that
the
habits
of
the
planters
should
be
changed
from
the
cultivation
of
staples
for
export
to
the
production
of
supplies
adequate
for
home
consumption
and
the
support
of
armies
in
the
field
yet
even
under
the
embarrassments
of
war
this
was
expected
and
for
a
long
time
the
result
justified
the
expectation
extraordinary
as
it
must
appear
when
viewed
by
comparison
with
other
people
who
have
been
subjected
to
a
like
ordeal
much
of
our
success
was
due
to
the
institution
of
african
servitude
for
it
enabled
the
white
men
to
go
into
the
army
and
leave
the
cultivation
of
their
fields
and
the
care
of
their
flocks
as
well
as
of
their
wives
and
children
to
those
who
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
were
held
to
service
or
labor
a
passing
remark
may
here
be
appropriate
as
to
the
answer
thus
afforded
to
the
clamor
about
the
horrors
of
slavery
had
these
africans
been
a
cruelly
oppressed
people
restlessly
struggling
to
be
freed
from
their
bonds
would
their
masters
have
dared
to
leave
them
as
was
done
and
would
they
have
remained
as
they
did
continuing
their
usual
duties
or
could
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
have
been
put
on
the
plea
of
a
military
necessity
if
the
fact
had
been
that
the
negroes
were
forced
to
serve
and
desired
only
an
opportunity
to
rise
against
their
masters
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
the
proclamation
was
issued
it
was
confessed
by
president
lincoln
to
be
a
nullity
beyond
the
limit
within
which
it
could
be
enforced
by
the
federal
troops
to
direct
the
production
preservation
collection
and
distribution
of
food
for
the
army
required
a
man
of
rare
capacity
and
character
at
the
head
of
the
subsistence
department
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
have
such
an
one
in
colonel
northrop
who
was
appointed
at
the
organization
of
the
bureaus
of
the
executive
department
of
the
confederate
government
he
had
been
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
had
served
in
various
parts
of
the
south
had
been
for
some
time
on
duty
in
the
commissariat
and
to
the
special
and
general
knowledge
thus
acquired
added
strong
practical
sense
and
incorruptible
integrity
of
him
and
the
operations
of
the
subsistence
department
i
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
when
treating
of
the
bureaus
of
the
confederacy
assured
of
an
army
as
large
as
the
population
of
the
confederate
states
could
furnish
and
a
sufficient
supply
of
subsistence
for
such
an
army
at
least
until
the
chances
of
war
should
interfere
with
production
and
transportation
the
immediate
object
of
attention
was
the
organization
instruction
and
equipment
of
the
army
as
heretofore
stated
there
was
a
prevailing
belief
that
there
would
be
no
war
or
if
any
that
it
would
be
of
very
short
duration
therefore
the
first
bill
which
passed
the
provisional
congress
provided
for
receiving
troops
for
short
periods
as
my
memory
serves
for
sixty
days
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
military
affairs
the
heroic
colonel
bartow
who
sealed
his
devotion
to
the
cause
with
his
life
blood
on
the
field
of
manassas
in
deference
to
my
earnest
remonstrance
against
such
a
policy
returned
with
the
bill
to
the
house
the
congress
then
consisted
of
but
one
house
and
procured
a
modification
by
which
the
term
of
service
was
extended
to
twelve
months
unless
sooner
discharged
i
had
urged
upon
him
in
our
conference
the
adoption
of
a
much
longer
period
but
he
assured
me
that
one
year
was
as
much
as
the
congress
would
agree
to
on
this
as
on
other
occasions
that
congress
showed
a
generous
desire
to
yield
their
preconceived
opinions
to
my
objections
as
far
as
they
consistently
could
and
there
being
but
one
house
it
was
easier
to
change
the
terms
of
a
bill
after
conference
with
the
executive
than
when
under
the
permanent
organization
objections
had
to
be
formally
communicated
in
a
message
to
that
branch
of
congress
in
which
the
bill
originated
and
when
the
whole
proceeding
was
of
record
this
first
act
to
provide
for
the
public
defense
became
a
law
on
the
of
february
and
its
fifth
section
so
clearly
indicates
the
opinions
and
expectations
prevailing
when
the
confederation
was
formed
that
it
is
inserted
here
that
the
president
be
further
authorized
to
receive
into
the
service
of
this
government
such
forces
now
in
the
service
of
said
states
confederate
states
as
may
be
tendered
or
who
may
volunteer
by
consent
of
their
state
in
such
numbers
as
he
may
require
for
any
time
not
less
than
twelve
months
unless
sooner
discharged
the
supremacy
of
the
states
is
the
controlling
idea
the
president
was
authorized
to
receive
from
the
several
states
the
arms
and
munitions
which
they
might
desire
to
transfer
to
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
and
he
was
also
authorized
to
receive
the
forces
which
the
states
might
tender
or
any
which
should
volunteer
by
the
of
their
for
any
time
not
less
than
twelve
months
unless
sooner
discharged
and
such
forces
were
to
be
received
with
their
officers
by
companies
battalions
or
regiments
and
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
congress
was
to
appoint
such
general
officer
or
officers
for
said
forces
as
might
be
necessary
for
the
service
it
will
be
seen
that
the
arms
and
munitions
within
the
limits
of
the
several
states
were
regarded
as
entirely
belonging
to
them
that
the
forces
which
were
to
constitute
the
provisional
army
could
only
be
drawn
from
the
several
states
by
their
consent
and
that
these
were
to
be
organized
under
state
authority
and
to
be
received
with
their
officers
so
appointed
that
the
lowest
organization
was
to
be
that
of
a
company
and
the
highest
that
of
a
regiment
and
that
the
appointment
of
general
officers
to
command
these
forces
was
confided
to
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
should
the
assembling
of
large
bodies
of
troops
require
organization
above
that
of
a
regiment
and
it
will
also
be
observed
that
provision
was
made
for
the
discharge
of
the
forces
so
provided
for
before
the
term
of
service
fixed
by
the
law
no
one
will
fail
to
perceive
how
little
was
anticipated
a
war
of
the
vast
proportions
and
great
duration
which
ensued
and
how
tenaciously
the
sovereignty
and
of
the
states
were
adhered
to
at
a
later
period
march
the
congress
adopted
resolutions
recommending
to
the
respective
states
to
cede
the
forts
arsenals
and
other
public
establishments
within
their
respective
limits
to
the
confederate
states
etc
the
hope
which
was
early
entertained
of
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
issues
pending
between
the
confederate
states
and
the
united
states
rapidly
diminished
so
that
we
find
on
the
of
march
that
the
congress
in
its
preamble
to
an
act
to
provide
for
the
public
defense
begins
with
the
declaration
that
in
order
to
provide
speedily
forces
to
repel
invasion
authorized
the
president
to
employ
the
militia
and
to
ask
for
and
accept
the
services
of
any
number
of
volunteers
not
exceeding
one
hundred
thousand
and
to
organize
companies
into
battalions
battalions
into
regiments
and
regiments
into
brigades
and
divisions
as
in
the
first
law
the
president
was
authorized
to
appoint
the
commanding
officer
of
such
brigades
and
divisions
the
commissions
only
to
endure
while
the
brigades
were
in
service
on
the
same
day
march
was
enacted
the
law
for
the
establishment
and
organization
of
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
this
being
in
contradistinction
to
the
provisional
army
which
was
to
be
composed
of
troops
tendered
by
the
states
as
in
the
first
act
and
volunteers
received
as
in
the
second
act
to
constitute
a
provisional
army
that
the
wish
and
policy
of
the
government
was
peace
is
again
manifested
in
this
act
which
in
providing
for
the
military
establishment
of
the
confederacy
fixed
the
number
of
enlisted
men
of
all
arms
at
nine
thousand
four
hundred
and
twenty
due
care
was
taken
to
prevent
the
appointment
of
incompetent
or
unworthy
persons
to
be
officers
of
the
army
and
the
right
to
promotion
up
to
and
including
the
grade
of
colonel
was
carefully
guarded
and
beyond
this
the
professional
character
of
the
army
was
recognized
as
follows
appointments
to
the
rank
of
after
the
army
is
organized
shall
be
made
by
selection
from
the
army
there
being
no
right
of
promotion
above
the
grade
of
colonel
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
selection
for
appointment
to
the
rank
of
general
had
no
other
restriction
than
the
necessity
for
confirmation
by
the
senate
the
provision
just
quoted
imposed
the
further
restriction
of
requiring
the
person
nominated
by
selection
to
have
previously
been
an
officer
of
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
regarding
the
army
of
the
united
states
as
belonging
neither
to
a
section
of
the
union
nor
to
the
general
government
but
to
the
states
conjointly
while
they
remained
united
it
follows
as
a
corollary
of
the
proposition
that
when
disintegration
occurred
the
undivided
composing
the
army
would
be
left
free
to
choose
their
future
place
of
service
therefore
provision
was
made
for
securing
to
officers
who
should
leave
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
join
that
of
the
confederate
states
the
same
relative
rank
in
the
latter
which
they
held
in
the
former
be
it
further
enacted
that
all
officers
who
have
resigned
or
who
may
within
six
months
tender
their
resignations
from
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
who
have
been
or
may
be
appointed
to
original
vacancies
in
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
the
commissions
issued
shall
bear
one
and
the
same
date
so
that
the
relative
rank
of
officers
of
each
grade
shall
be
determined
by
their
former
commissions
in
the
united
states
army
held
anterior
to
the
secession
of
these
confederate
states
from
the
united
states
the
provisions
hereof
are
in
the
view
entertained
that
the
army
was
of
the
states
not
of
the
government
and
was
to
secure
to
officers
adhering
to
the
confederate
states
the
same
relative
rank
which
they
had
before
those
states
had
withdrawn
from
the
union
it
was
clearly
the
intent
of
the
law
to
embrace
in
this
provision
only
those
officers
who
had
resigned
or
who
should
resign
from
the
united
states
army
to
enter
the
service
of
the
confederacy
or
who
in
other
words
should
thus
be
transferred
from
one
service
to
the
other
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
in
the
eleventh
section
of
the
act
to
which
this
was
amendatory
the
right
of
promotion
up
to
the
grade
of
colonel
in
established
regiments
and
corps
was
absolutely
secured
but
that
appointments
to
the
higher
grade
should
be
by
selection
at
first
without
restriction
but
after
the
army
had
been
organized
the
selection
was
confined
to
the
army
thus
recognizing
the
profession
of
arms
and
relieving
officers
from
the
hazard
beyond
the
limit
of
their
legal
right
to
promotion
of
being
superseded
by
civilians
through
favoritism
or
political
influence
how
well
the
government
of
the
confederacy
observed
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
law
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
its
action
in
the
matter
of
appointments
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
the
three
highest
officers
in
rank
and
whose
fame
stands
unchallenged
either
for
efficiency
or
zeal
were
all
so
indifferent
to
any
question
of
personal
interest
that
they
had
received
their
appointment
before
they
were
aware
it
was
to
be
conferred
each
brought
from
the
army
of
the
united
states
an
enviable
reputation
such
as
would
have
secured
to
him
had
he
chosen
to
remain
in
it
after
the
war
commenced
any
position
his
ambition
could
have
coveted
therefore
against
considerations
of
and
impelled
by
devotion
to
principle
they
severed
the
ties
professional
and
personal
which
had
bound
them
from
their
youth
up
to
the
time
when
the
southern
states
asserting
the
consecrated
truth
that
all
governments
rest
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
decided
to
withdraw
from
the
union
they
had
voluntarily
entered
and
the
northern
states
resolved
to
coerce
them
to
remain
in
it
against
their
will

officers

confederate

samuel
cooper
was
the
first
of
these
to
offer
his
services
to
the
confederacy
at
montgomery
having
known
him
most
favorably
and
intimately
as
of
the
united
states
army
when
i
was
secretary
of
war
the
value
of
his
services
in
the
organization
of
a
new
army
was
considered
so
great
that
i
invited
him
to
take
the
position
of
of
the
confederate
army
which
he
accepted
without
a
question
either
as
to
relative
rank
or
anything
else
the
highest
grade
then
authorized
by
law
was
that
of
and
that
commission
was
bestowed
upon
him
when
general
albert
sidney
johnston
reached
richmond
he
called
upon
me
and
for
several
days
at
various
intervals
we
conversed
with
the
freedom
and
confidence
belonging
to
the
close
friendship
which
had
existed
between
us
for
many
years
consequent
upon
a
remark
made
by
me
he
asked
to
what
duty
i
would
assign
him
and
when
answered
to
serve
in
the
west
he
expressed
his
pleasure
at
service
in
that
section
but
inquired
how
he
was
to
raise
his
command
and
for
the
first
time
learned
that
he
had
been
nominated
and
confirmed
as
a
general
in
the
army
of
the
confederacy
the
third
general
robert
lee
had
been
commissioned
by
the
state
of
virginia
as
and
commander
of
her
army
when
that
army
was
transferred
after
the
accession
of
virginia
to
the
confederate
states
he
was
nominated
to
be
in
the
confederate
army
but
was
left
for
obvious
reasons
in
command
of
the
forces
in
virginia
after
the
seat
of
government
was
removed
from
montgomery
to
richmond
the
course
of
events
on
the
southern
atlantic
coast
induced
me
to
direct
general
lee
to
repair
thither
before
leaving
he
said
that
while
he
was
serving
in
virginia
he
had
never
thought
it
needful
to
inquire
about
his
rank
but
now
when
about
to
go
into
other
states
and
to
meet
officers
with
whom
he
had
not
been
previously
connected
he
would
like
to
be
informed
upon
that
point
under
recent
laws
authorizing
appointments
to
higher
grades
than
that
of
his
first
commission
he
had
been
appointed
a
full
general
but
so
wholly
had
his
heart
and
his
mind
been
consecrated
to
the
public
service
that
he
had
not
remembered
if
he
ever
knew
of
his
advancement
in
organizing
the
bureaus
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
select
for
the
chief
of
each
officers
possessing
special
knowledge
of
the
duties
to
be
performed
the
best
assurance
of
that
qualification
was
believed
to
be

creditably
rendered
in
the
several
departments
of

resigning

reason
of

heretofore
alluded
to

difficult
task
thus
imposed
on
him

the
success
with
which
he
performed
it
and
would
be
pleased
here
to
enter
into
a
fuller
recital

needful
information

merit

appointed

of

in
the
case
of
other
departments
there
was
in
this
a
want
of
the

requisite
as
well
for

as
the

to
supply
medicines
which
were
declared
by
the
enemy
to
be
contraband

to

as

you
are
authorized
to
proceed
as
hereinafter
set
forth
to
make
purchases
and
contracts
for
machinery
and
munitions
or
for
the
manufacture
of

and
munitions
of

of
the
proprietor
of
the

company
in
you
will
probably
be
able
to
obtain
and
the
former
to
be
of
the
coarsest
grain
and
also
to
engage
with
him
for
the
establishment
of
a
at
some
point
in
the
limits
of
our
territory
the
quantity
of
powder
to
be
supplied
immediately
will
exceed
his
stock
on
hand
and
the
arrangement
for
further
supply
should
if
possible
be
by
manufacture
in
our
own
territory
if
this
is
not
practicable
means
must
be
sought
for
further
shipments
from
any
and
all
sources
which
are
reliable
at
the
arsenal
at
washington
you
will
find
an
artisan
named
who
has
brought
the
machine
to
its
present
state
of
efficiency
and
who
might
furnish
a
and
accompany
it
to
direct
its
operations
if
not
in
this
i
hope
you
may
in
some
other
way
be
able
to
obtain
a
with
little
delay
and
have
it
sent
to
the
mount
vernon
arsenal
alabama
we
shall
require
a
manufactory
for
and
you
will
if
possible
induce
some
capable
person
to
establish
one
in
our
country
the
demand
of
the
confederate
states
will
be
the
inducement
in
this
as
in
the
case
of
the
proposed
a
short
time
since
the
most
improved
machinery
for
the
manufacture
of
rifles
intended
for
the
harper
ferry
armory
was
it
was
said
for
sale
by
the
manufacturer
if
it
be
so
at
this
time
you
will
procure
it
for
this
government
and
use
the
needful
precaution
in
relation
to
its
transportation
of
the
harper
ferry
armory
can
give
you
all
the
information
in
that
connection
which
you
may
require
ball
the
master
armorer
at
harper
ferry
is
willing
to
accept
service
under
our
government
and
could
probably
bring
with
him
skilled
workmen
if
we
get
the
machinery
this
will
be
important
machinery
for
grooving
muskets
and
heavy
guns
is
i
hope
to
be
purchased
ready
made
if
not
you
will
contract
for
its
manufacture
and
delivery
you
will
endeavor
to
obtain
the
most
improved

either
as

only
to

for
your
reflection
and
consideration
the
points
which
have
chanced
to
come
under

you
will
use
your

jefferson
davis
captain
semmes
had
also
been
directed
to
seek
for
vessels
which
would
serve
for
naval
purposes
and
after
his
return
reported
that
he
could
not
find
any
vessels
which
in
his
judgment
were
or
could
be
made
available
for
our
uses
the
southern
officers
of
the
navy
who
were
in
command
of
united
states
vessels
abroad
under
an
idea
more
creditable
to
their
sentiment
than
to
their
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
our
constitutional
union
brought
the
vessels
they
commanded
into
the
ports
of
the
north
and
having
delivered
them
to
the
authorities
of
the
united
states
government
generally
tendered
their
resignations
and
repaired
to
the
states
from
which
they
had
been
commissioned
in
the
navy
to
serve
where
they
held
their
allegiance
to
be
due
the
theory
that
they
owed
allegiance
to
their
respective
states
was
founded
on
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
was
of
the
states
the
sequence
was
that
the
navy
belonged
to
the
states
not
to
their
agent
the
federal
government
and
when
the
states
ceased
to
be
united
the
naval
vessels
and
armament
should
have
been
divided
among
the
owners
while
we
honor
the
sentiment
which
caused
them
to
surrender
their
associations
and
the
profession
to
which
they
were
bred
on
which
they
relied
for
subsistence
to
go
with
nothing
save
their
swords
and
faithful
hearts
to
fight
to
bleed
and
to
die
if
need
be
in
defense
of
their
homes
and
a
righteous
cause
we
can
but
remember
how
much
was
lost
by
their
view
of
what
their
honor
and
duty
demanded
far
however
be
it
from
their
countrymen
for
that
or
any
other
consideration
to
wish
that
their
fidelity
to
the
dictates
of
a
conscientious
belief
should
have
yielded
to
any
temptation
of
interest
the
course
they
pursued
shows
how
impossible
it
was
that
they
should
have
done
so
for
what
did
they
not
sacrifice
to
their
sense
of
right
we
were
doubly
bereft
by
losing
our
share
of
the
navy
we
had
contributed
to
build
and
by
having
it
all
employed
to
assail
us
the
application
of
the
appropriations
for
the
navy
of
the
united
states
had
been
such
that
the
construction
of
vessels
had
been
at
the
north
though
much
of
the
timber
used
and
other
material
employed
was
transported
from
the
south
to
northern
therefore
we
were
without
the
accessories
needful
for
the
rapid
supply
of
naval
vessels
while
attempting
whatever
was
practicable
at
home
we
sent
a
competent
officer
of
the
navy
to
england
to
obtain
there
and
elsewhere
by
purchase
or
by
building
vessels
which
could
be
transformed
into
ships
of
war
these
efforts
and
their
results
will
be
noticed
more
fully
hereafter
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
remark
here
that
if
the
anticipations
of
our
people
were
not
realized
it
was
not
from
any
lack
of
the
zeal
and
ability
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
mallory
as
was
heretofore
stated
his
fondness
for
and
aptitude
in
nautical
affairs
had
led
him
to
know
much
of
vessels
their
construction
and
management
and
as
chairman
of
the
committee
on
united
states
naval
affairs
he
had
superadded
to
this
a
very
large
acquaintance
with
officers
of
the
united
states
navy
which
gave
him
the
requisite
information
for
the
most
useful
employment
of
the
instructed
officers
who
joined
our
service
at
the
north
many
had
been
deceived
by
the
fictions
of
preparations
at
the
south
for
the
war
of
the
sections
and
among
ourselves
were
few
who
realized
how
totally
deficient
the
southern
states
were
in
all
which
was
necessary
to
the
active
operations
of
an
army
however
gallant
the
men
might
be
and
however
able
were
the
generals
who
directed
and
led
them
from
these
causes
operating
jointly
resulted
undue
caution
at
the
north
and
overweening
confidence
at
the
south
the
habits
of
our
people
in
hunting
and
protecting
their
stock
in
fields
from
the
ravages
of
ferocious
beasts
caused
them
to
be
generally
supplied
with
the
arms
used
for
such
purposes
the
facility
with
which
individuals
traveled
over
the
country
led
to
very
erroneous
ideas
as
to
the
difficulties
of
transporting
an
army
the
small
amount
of
ammunition
required
in
time
of
peace
gave
no
measure
of
the
amount
requisite
for
warlike
operations
and
the
products
of
a
country
which
insufficiently
supplied
food
for
its
inhabitants
when
peaceful
pursuits
were
uninterrupted
would
serve
but
a
short
time
to
furnish
the
commissariat
of
a
large
army
it
was
of
course
easy
to
foresee
that
if
war
was
waged
against
the
seceding
states
by
all
of
those
which
remained
in
the
union
the
large
supply
of
provisions
which
had
been
annually
sent
from
the
northwest
to
the
south
could
not
under
the
altered
circumstances
be
relied
on
that
our
people
did
not
more
immediately
turn
their
attention
to
the
production
of
may
be
attributed
to
the
prevailing
delusion
that
secession
would
not
be
followed
by
war
to
the
able
officer
then
at
the
head
of
the
commissariat
department
colonel
northrop
much
credit
is
due
for
his
efforts
to
provide
both
for
immediate
and
prospective
wants
it
gives
me
the
greater
pleasure
to
say
this
because
those
less
informed
of
all
he
did
and
skillfully
tried
to
do
have
been
profuse
of
criticism
and
sparing
indeed
of
the
meed
justly
his
due
adequate
facilities
for
transportation
might
have
relieved
the
local
want
of
supplies
especially
in
virginia
where
the
largest
bodies
of
troops
were
assembled
but
unfortunately
the
department
was
scarcely
less
provided
than
that
of
the
commissary
not
only
were
the
railroads
insufficient
in
number
but
they
were
poorly
furnished
with
rolling
stock
and
had
been
mainly
dependent
upon
northern
foundries
and
factories
for
their
rails
and
equipment
even
the
skilled
operatives
of
the
railroads
were
generally
northern
men
and
their
desertion
followed
fast
upon
every
disaster
which
attended
the
confederate
arms
in
addition
to
other
causes
which
have
been
mentioned
the
idea
that
cotton
was
king
and
would
produce
foreign
intervention
as
well
as
a
desire
of
the
northern
people
for
the
return
of
peace
and
the
restoration
of
trade
exercised
a
potent
influence
in
preventing
our
agriculturists
from
directing
at
an
early
period
their
capital
and
labor
to
the
production
of
rather
than
that
of
our
staple
for
export
as
one
after
another
the
illusions
vanished
and
the
material
necessities
of
a
great
war
were
recognized
by
our
people
never
did
patriotic
devotion
exhibit
brighter
examples
of
the
sacrifice
of
and
the
abandonment
of
fixed
habits
and
opinions
or
more
effective
and
untiring
effort
to
meet
the
herculean
task
which
was
set
before
them
being
one
of
the
few
who
regarded
secession
and
war
as
inevitably
connected
my
early
attention
was
given
to
the
organization
of
military
forces
and
the
procurement
and
preparation
of
the
munitions
of
war
if
our
people
had
not
gone
to
war
without
counting
the
cost
they
were
nevertheless
involved
in
it
without
means
of
providing
for
its
necessities
it
has
been
heretofore
stated
that
we
had
no
it
would
be
needless
to
say
that
the
government
had
no
depots
of
powder
but
it
may
be
well
to
add
that
beyond
the
small
supply
required
for
sporting
purposes
our
local
traders
had
no
stock
on
hand
having
no
manufacturing
industries
which
required
saltpeter
very
little
of
that
was
purchasable
in
our
markets
the
same
would
have
been
the
case
in
regard
to
sulphur
but
for
the
fact
that
it
had
been
recently
employed
in
the
clarification
of
juice
and
thus
a
considerable
amount
of
it
was
found
in
new
orleans
prompt
measures
were
taken
to
secure
a
supply
of
sulphur
and
parties
were
employed
to
obtain
saltpeter
from
the
caves
as
well
as
from
the
earth
of
old
and
cellars
and
artificial
were
made
to
provide
for
prospective
wants
of
soft
wood
for
charcoal
there
was
abundance
and
thus
materials
were
procured
for
the
manufacture
of
gunpowder
to
meet
the
demand
which
would
arise
when
the
limited
quantity
purchased
by
the
confederate
government
at
the
north
should
be
exhausted
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
secure
the
services
of
an
able
and
scientific
soldier
general
rains
who
to
a
military
education
added
experience
in
a
large
manufacturing
establishment
and
to
him
was
confided
the
construction
of
a
and
the
manufacture
of
powder
both
for
artillery
and
the
appalling
contemplation
of
the
inauguration
of
a
great
war
without
powder
or
a
navy
to
secure
its
importation
from
abroad
was
soon
relieved
by
the
extraordinary
efforts
of
the
ordnance
department
and
the
skill
of
general
rains
to
whom
it
is
but
a
just
tribute
to
say
that
beginning
without
even
instructed
workmen
he
had
before
the
close
of
the
war
made
what
in
the
opinion
of
competent
judges
has
been
pronounced
to
be
the
best
in
the
world
and
in
which
powder
of
every
variety
of
grain
was
manufactured
of
materials
which
had
been
purified
from
those
qualities
which
cause
its
deterioration
under
long
exposure
to
a
moist
atmosphere
the
avowed
purpose
and
declared
obligation
of
the
federal
government
was
to
occupy
and
possess
the
property
belonging
to
the
united
states
yet
one
of
the
first
acts
was
to
set
fire
to
the
armory
at
harper
ferry
virginia
the
only
establishment
of
the
kind
in
the
southern
states
and
the
only
southern
depository
of
the
rifles
which
the
general
government
had
then
on
hand
what
conclusion
is
to
be
drawn
from
such
action
to
avoid
attributing
a
breach
of
solemn
pledges
it
must
be
supposed
that
virginia
was
considered
as
out
of
the
union
and
a
public
enemy
in
whose
borders
it
was
proper
to
destroy
whatever
might
be
useful
to
her
of
the
common
property
of
the
states
lately
united
as
soon
as
the
united
states
troops
had
evacuated
the
place
the
citizens
and
armorers
went
to
work
to
save
the
armory
as
far
as
possible
from
destruction
and
to
secure
valuable
material
stored
in
it
the
master
armorer
armistead
ball
so
bravely
and
skillfully
directed
these
efforts
that
a
large
part
of
the
machinery
and
materials
was
saved
from
the
flames
the
subduing
of
the
fire
was
a
dangerous
and
difficult
task
and
great
credit
is
due
to
those
who
under
the
orders
of
master
armorer
ball
attempted
and
achieved
it
when
the
fire
was
extinguished
the
work
was
continued
and
persevered
in
until
all
the
valuable
machinery
and
material
had
been
collected
boxed
and
shipped
to
richmond
about
the
end
of
the
summer
of
the
machinery
thus
secured
was
divided
between
the
arsenals
at
richmond
virginia
and
fayetteville
north
carolina
and
when
repaired
and
put
in
working
condition
supplied
to
some
extent
the
want
which
existed
in
the
south
of
means
for
the
alteration
and
repair
of
old
or
injured
arms
and
finally
contributed
to
increase
the
very
scanty
supply
of
arms
with
which
our
country
was
furnished
when
the
war
began
the
practice
of
the
federal
government
which
had
kept
the
construction
and
manufacture
of
the
material
of
war
at
the
north
had
consequently
left
the
south
without
the
requisite
number
of
skilled
workmen
by
whose
labor
machinery
could
at
once
be
made
fully
effective
if
it
were
obtained
indeed
the
want
of
such
employees
prevented
the
small
amount
of
machinery
on
hand
from
being
worked
to
its
full
capacity
the
gallant
master
armorer
ball
whose
capacity
zeal
and
fidelity
deserve
more
than
a
passing
notice
was
sent
with
that
part
of
the
machinery
assigned
to
the
fayetteville
arsenal
the
toil
the
anxiety
and
responsibility
of
his
perilous
position
at
harper
ferry
where
he
remained
long
after
the
protecting
force
of
the
confederate
army
retired
had
probably
undermined
a
constitution
so
vigorous
that
in
the
face
of
a
great
exigency
no
labor
seemed
too
great
or
too
long
for
him
to
grapple
with
and
endure
so
like
a
ship
which
after
having
weathered
the
storm
goes
down
in
the
calm
the
master
armorer
soon
after
he
took
his
quiet
post
at
fayetteville
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
the
difficulties
which
on
every
side
met
the
several
departments
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
one
must
suppose
were
but
little
appreciated
by
many
whose
opportunities
for
exact
observation
were
the
best
as
one
often
meets
with
expressions
as
to
modes
of
achieving
readily
what
prompt
patient
zealous
effort
proved
to
be
insurmountable
in
the
progress
of
this
work
it
is
hoped
will
be
presented
not
only
the
magnitude
of
the
obstacles
but
the
spirit
and
capacity
with
which
they
were
encountered
by
the
unseen
and
much
undervalued
labors
of
the
officers
of
the
several
departments
on
whom
devolved
provision
for
the
civil
service
as
well
as
for
the
armies
in
the
field
already
has
the
report
of
general
john
general
of
subsistence
of
the
operations
of
that
department
just
before
the
close
of
the
war
exposed
the
hollowness
of
many
sensational
pictures
intended
to
fix
gross
neglect
or
utter
incapacity
on
the
executive
the
and
expected
monograms
of
other
chiefs
of
bureaus
will
silence
like
criticisms
on
each
so
far
as
they
are
made

if
any
further
evidence
had
been
required
to

that
it
was
the
determination
of
the
northern
people
not
only
to
make
no
concessions
to
the
grievances
of
the
southern
states
but
to
increase
them
to
the
last
extremity
it
was
furnished
by
the
proclamation
of
president
lincoln
issued
on
april
this
proclamation
which
has
already
been
mentioned
requires
a
further
examination
as
it
was
the
official
declaration
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
the
war
which
ensued
in
it
the
president
called
for
thousand
men
to
suppress
combinations
opposed
to
the
laws
and
obstructing
their
execution
in
seven
sovereign
states
which
had
retired
from
the
union
thousand
men
organized
and
equipped
are
a
powerful
army
and
when
raised
to
operate
against
these
states
nothing
else
than
war
could
be
intended
the
words
in
which
he
summoned
this
force
were
these
whereas
the
laws
of
the
united
states
have
been
for
some
time
past
and
now
are
opposed
and
the
execution
thereof
obstructed
in
the
states
of
south
carolina
georgia
alabama
florida
mississippi
louisiana
and
texas
by
combinations
too
powerful
to
be
suppressed
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
or
by
the
powers
vested
in
the
marshals
by
law
now
therefore
i
abraham
lincoln
by
virtue
of
the
power
in
me
vested
by
the
constitution
and
laws
etc
the
power
granted
in
the
constitution
is
thus
expressed
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
union
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasions
it
was
to
the
congress
not
the
executive
to
whom
the
power
was
delegated
and
thus
early
was
commenced
a
long
series
of
usurpations
of
powers
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
for
which
the
union
was
formed
and
destructive
of
the
fraternity
it
was
designed
to
perpetuate
on
november
the
legislature
of
south
carolina
assembled
and
gave
the
vote
of
the
state
for
electors
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
on
the
next
day
an
act
was
passed
calling
a
state
convention
to
assemble
on
december
to
determine
the
question
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
state
from
the
united
states
candidates
for
membership
were
immediately
nominated
all
were
in
favor
of
secession
the
convention
assembled
on
december
and
on
the
passed
an
ordinance
to
dissolve
the
union
between
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
other
states
united
with
her
under
the
compact
entitled
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
ordinance
began
with
these
words
we
the
people
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
convention
assembled
do
declare
and
ordain
etc
the
state
authorities
immediately
conformed
to
this
action
of
the
convention
and
the
laws
and
authority
of
the
united
states
ceased
to
be
obeyed
within
the
limits
of
the
state
about
four
months
afterward
when
the
state
in
union
with
others
which
had
joined
her
had
possessed
herself
of
the
forts
within
her
limits
which
the
united
states
government
had
refused
to
evacuate
president
lincoln
issued
the
proclamation
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
designated
in
the
proclamation
as
a
combination
too
powerful
to
be
suppressed
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
or
by
the
powers
vested
in
the
marshals
by
law
this
designation
does
not
recognize
the
state
or
manifest
any
consciousness
of
its
existence
whereas
south
carolina
was
one
of
the
colonies
that
had
declared
her
independence
and
after
a
long
and
bloody
war
she
had
been
recognized
as
a
sovereign
state
by
great
britain
the
only
power
to
which
she
had
ever
owed
allegiance
the
fact
that
she
had
been
one
of
the
colonies
in
the
original
congress
had
been
a
member
of
the
confederation
and
subsequently
of
the
union
strengthens
but
surely
can
not
impair
her
claim
to
be
a
state
though
president
lincoln
designated
her
as
a
combination
it
did
not
make
her
a
combination
though
he
refused
to
recognize
her
as
a
state
it
did
not
make
her
any
less
a
state
by
assertion
he
attempted
to
annihilate
seven
states
and
the
war
which
followed
was
to
enforce
the
revolutionary
edict
and
to
establish
the
supremacy
of
the
general
government
on
the
ruins
of
the
independence
of
the
states
by
designating
the
state
as
a
combination
and
considering
that
under
such
a
name
it
might
be
in
a
condition
of
insurrection
he
assumed
to
have
authority
to
raise
a
great
military
force
and
attack
the
state
yet
even
if
the
fact
had
been
as
assumed
if
an
insurrection
had
existed
the
president
could
not
lawfully
have
derived
the
power
he
exercised
from
such
condition
of
affairs
the
provision
of
the
constitution
is
as
follows
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
of
government
and
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
invasion
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
of
the
executive
when
the
legislature
can
not
be
convened
against
domestic
violence
so
the
guarantee
availed
not
at
all
to
justify
the
act
which
it
was
presented
to
excuse
the
fact
being
that
a
state
and
not
an
unlawful
combination
as
asserted
was
the
object
of
assault
and
the
case
one
of
making
war
for
a
state
or
union
of
states
to
attack
with
military
force
another
state
is
to
make
war
by
the
constitution
the
power
to
make
war
is
given
solely
to
congress
congress
shall
have
power
to
declare
war
says
the
constitution
and
again
to
raise
and
support
armies
thus
under
a
perverted
use
of
language
the
executive
at
washington
did
that
which
he
undeniably
had
no
power
to
do
under
a
faithful
observance
of
the
constitution
to
justify
himself
to
congress
and
the
people
or
rather
before
the
face
of
mankind
for
this
evasion
of
the
constitution
of
his
country
president
lincoln
in
his
message
to
congress
of
july
resorted
to
the
artifice
of
saying
it
meaning
the
proceedings
of
the
confederate
states
presents
to
the
whole
family
of
man
the
question
whether
a
constitutional
republic
or
democracy
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
same
people
can
or
can
not
maintain
its
territorial
integrity
against
its
own
domestic
foes
the
answer
to
this
question
is
very
plain
in
the
nature
of
things
no
union
can
be
formed
except
by
separate
independent
and
distinct
parties
any
other
combination
is
not
a
union
and
upon
the
destruction
of
any
of
these
elements
in
the
parties
the
union
ceases
if
the
government
is
the
result
of
a
union
of
states
then
these
states
must
be
separate
sovereign
and
distinct
to
be
able
to
form
a
union
which
is
entirely
an
act
of
their
own
volition
such
a
government
as
ours
had
no
power
to
maintain
its
existence
any
longer
than
the
contracting
parties
pleased
to
cohere
because
it
was
founded
on
the
great
principle
of
voluntary
federation
and
organized
to
establish
justice
and
insure
domestic
tranquillity
any
departure
from
this
principle
by
the
general
government
not
only
perverts
and
destroys
its
nature
but
furnishes
a
just
cause
to
the
injured
state
to
withdraw
from
the
union
a
new
union
might
subsequently
be
formed
but
the
original
one
could
never
by
coercion
be
restored
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
others
to
force
the
seceding
state
to
consent
to
come
back
is
an
attempt
at
subjugation
it
is
a
wrong
which
no
lapse
of
time
or
combination
of
circumstances
can
ever
make
right
a
forced
union
is
a
political
absurdity
no
less
absurd
is
president
lincoln
effort
to
dissever
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
from
that
of
the
state
as
if
there
could
be
a
state
without
a
people
or
a
sovereign
people
without
a
state
but
the
question
which
lincoln
presents
to
the
whole
family
of
man
deserves
a
further
notice
the
answer
which
he
seems
to
infer
would
be
given
by
the
whole
family
of
man
is
that
such
a
government
as
he
supposes
can
maintain
its
territorial
integrity
against
its
own
domestic
foes
and
therefore
he
concluded
that
he
was
right
in
the
judgment
of
the
whole
family
of
man
in
commencing
hostilities
against
us
he
says
so
viewing
the
issue
no
choice
was
left
but
to
call
out
the
war
power
of
the
government
that
is
the
power
to
make
war
against
foreign
nations
for
the
government
has
no
other
war
power
planting
himself
on
this
position
he
commenced
the
devastation
and
bloodshed
which
followed
to
effect
our
subjugation
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
than
such
views
the
supposed
case
which
he
presents
is
entirely
unlike
the
real
case
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
like
no
other
government
it
is
neither
a
constitutional
republic
or
democracy
nor
has
it
ever
been
thus
called
neither
is
it
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
same
people
but
it
is
known
and
designated
as
the
government
of
the
united
states
it
is
an
anomaly
among
governments
its
authority
consists
solely
of
certain
powers
delegated
to
it
as
a
common
agent
by
an
association
of
sovereign
and
independent
states
these
powers
are
to
be
exercised
only
for
certain
specified
objects
and
the
purposes
declared
in
the
beginning
of
the
deed
or
instrument
of
delegation
were
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
the
powers
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
to
be
found
in
that
instrument
of
delegation
all
its
powers
are
there
expressed
defined
and
limited
it
was
only
to
that
instrument
lincoln
as
president
should
have
gone
to
learn
his
duties
that
was
the
chart
which
he
had
just
solemnly
pledged
himself
to
the
country
faithfully
to
follow
he
soon
deviated
widely
from
it
and
fatally
erroneous
was
his
course
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
a
great
people
at
a
most
perilous
period
is
decided
by
the
answer
which
it
is
assumed
the
whole
family
of
man
would
give
to
a
supposed
condition
of
human
affairs
which
did
not
exist
and
which
could
not
exist
this
is
the
ground
upon
which
the
rectitude
of
his
cause
was
placed
he
says
no
choice
was
left
but
to
call
out
the
war
power
of
the
government
and
so
to
resist
force
employed
for
its
destruction
by
force
for
its
preservation
here
he
says
no
choice
was
left
but
to
call
out
the
war
power
of
the
government
for
what
purpose
must
he
call
out
this
war
power
he
answers
by
saying
and
so
to
resist
force
employed
for
its
destruction
by
force
for
its
preservation
but
this
which
he
asserts
is
not
a
fact
there
was
no
force
employed
for
its
destruction
let
the
reader
turn
to
the
record
of
the
facts
in
part
iii
of
this
work
and
peruse
the
fruitless
efforts
for
peace
which
were
made
by
us
and
which
lincoln
did
not
deign
to
notice
the
assertion
is
not
only
incorrect
in
stating
that
force
was
employed
by
us
but
also
in
declaring
that
it
was
for
the
destruction
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
the
contrary
we
wished
to
leave
it
alone
our
separation
did
not
involve
its
destruction
to
such
fiction
was
lincoln
compelled
to
resort
to
give
even
apparent
justice
to
his
cause
he
now
goes
to
the
constitution
for
the
exercise
of
his
war
power
and
here
we
have
another
fiction
on
april
four
days
later
president
lincoln
issued
another
proclamation
announcing
a
blockade
of
the
ports
of
seven
confederated
states
which
was
afterward
extended
to
north
carolina
and
virginia
it
further
declared
that
all
persons
who
should
under
their
authority
molest
any
vessel
of
the
united
states
or
the
persons
or
cargo
on
board
should
be
treated
as
pirates
in
their
efforts
to
subjugate
us
the
destruction
of
our
commerce
was
regarded
by
the
authorities
at
washington
as
a
most
efficient
measure
it
was
early
seen
that
although
acts
of
congress
established
ports
of
entry
where
commerce
existed
they
might
be
repealed
and
the
ports
nominally
closed
or
declared
to
be
closed
yet
such
a
declaration
would
be
of
no
avail
unless
sustained
by
a
naval
force
as
these
ports
were
located
in
territory
not
subject
to
the
united
states
an
act
was
subsequently
passed
authorizing
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
his
discretion
to
close
our
ports
but
it
was
never
executed
the
scheme
of
blockade
was
resorted
to
and
a
falsehood
was
asserted
on
which
to
base
it
seward
writes
to
dallas
you
will
say
to
lord
john
russell
that
by
our
own
laws
and
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
laws
of
nations
this
government
has
a
clear
right
to
suppress
insurrection
an
exclusion
of
commerce
from
national
ports
which
have
been
seized
by
insurgents
in
the
equitable
form
of
blockade
is
a
proper
means
to
that
end
this
is
the
same
doctrine
of
combinations
fabricated
by
the
authorities
at
washington
to
serve
as
the
basis
of
a
bloody
revolution
under
the
laws
of
nations
separate
governments
when
at
war
blockade
each
other
ports
this
is
decided
to
be
justifiable
but
the
government
of
the
united
states
could
not
consent
to
justify
its
blockade
of
our
ports
on
this
ground
as
it
would
be
an
admission
that
the
confederate
states
were
a
separate
and
distinct
sovereignty
and
that
the
war
was
prosecuted
only
for
subjugation
it
therefore
assumed
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
southern
states
from
the
union
was
an
insurrection
was
it
an
insurrection
when
certain
sovereign
and
independent
states
form
a
union
with
limited
powers
for
some
general
purposes
and
any
one
or
more
of
them
in
the
progress
of
time
suffer
unjust
and
oppressive
grievances
for
which
there
is
no
redress
but
in
a
withdrawal
from
the
association
is
such
withdrawal
an
insurrection
if
so
then
of
what
advantage
is
a
compact
of
union
to
states
within
the
union
are
oppressions
and
grievances
and
the
attempt
to
go
out
brings
war
and
subjugation
the
ambitious
and
aggressive
states
obtain
possession
of
the
central
authority
which
having
grown
strong
in
the
lapse
of
time
asserts
its
entire
sovereignty
over
the
states
whichever
of
them
denies
it
and
seeks
to
retire
is
declared
to
be
guilty
of
insurrection
its
citizens
are
stigmatized
as
rebels
as
if
they
had
revolted
against
a
master
and
a
war
of
subjugation
is
begun
if
this
action
is
once
tolerated
where
will
it
end
where
is
the
value
of
constitutional
liberty
what
strength
is
there
in
bills
of
rights
in
limitations
of
power
what
new
hope
for
mankind
is
to
be
found
in
written
constitutions
what
remedy
which
did
not
exist
under
kings
or
emperors
if
the
doctrines
thus
announced
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
conceded
then
look
through
either
end
of
the
political
telescope
and
one
sees
only
an
empire
and
the
once
famous
declaration
of
independence
trodden
in
the
dust
as
a
glittering
generality
and
the
compact
of
union
denounced
as
a
flaunting
lie
those
who
submit
to
such
consequences
without
resistance
are
not
worthy
of
the
liberties
and
the
rights
to
which
they
were
born
and
deserve
to
be
made
slaves
such
must
be
the
verdict
of
mankind
men
do
not
fight
to
make
a
fraternal
union
neither
do
nations
these
military
preparations
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
signified
nothing
less
than
the
subjugation
of
the
southern
states
so
that
by
one
devastating
blow
the
north
might
grasp
for
ever
that
supremacy
it
had
so
long
coveted
to
be
prepared
for
i
called
congress
together
at
montgomery
on
april
and
in
the
message
of
that
date
thus
spoke
of
the
proclamation
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
apparently
contradictory
as
are
the
terms
of
this
singular
document
one
point
is
unmistakably
evident
the
president
of
the
united
states
calls
for
an
army
of
thousand
men
whose
first
service
is
to
be
the
capture
of
our
forts
it
is
a
plain
declaration
of
war
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
disregard
because
of
my
knowledge
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
president
is
usurping
a
power
granted
exclusively
to
congress
i
then
proceeded
to
say
that
i
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
disregard
the
fact
that
many
of
the
states
seemed
quite
content
to
submit
to
the
exercise
of
the
powers
assumed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
were
actively
engaged
in
levying
troops
for
the
purpose
indicated
in
the
proclamation
meantime
being
deprived
of
the
aid
of
congress
i
had
been
under
the
necessity
of
confining
my
action
to
a
call
on
the
states
for
volunteers
for
the
common
defense
in
accordance
with
authority
previously
conferred
on
me
i
stated
that
there
were
then
in
the
field
at
charleston
pensacola
forts
morgan
jackson
philip
and
pulaski
nineteen
thousand
men
and
sixteen
thousand
more
were
on
their
way
to
virginia
that
it
was
proposed
to
organize
and
hold
in
readiness
for
instant
action
in
view
of
the
existing
exigencies
of
the
country
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
that
if
a
further
force
should
be
needed
congress
would
be
appealed
to
for
authority
to
call
it
into
the
field
finally
that
the
intent
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
already
developed
to
invade
our
soil
capture
our
forts
blockade
our
ports
and
wage
war
against
us
rendered
it
necessary
to
raise
means
to
a
much
larger
amount
than
had
been
done
to
defray
the
expenses
of
maintaining
independence
and
repelling
invasion
a
brief
summary
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
government
followed
and
notwithstanding
frequent
declarations
of
the
peaceful
intentions
of
the
withdrawing
states
had
been
made
in
the
most
solemn
manner
it
was
deemed
not
to
be
out
of
place
to
repeat
them
once
more
and
therefore
the
message
closed
with
these
words
we
protest
solemnly
in
the
face
of
mankind
that
we
desire
peace
at
any
sacrifice
save
that
of
honor
in
independence
we
seek
no
conquest
no
aggrandizement
no
concession
of
any
kind
from
the
states
with
which
we
have
lately
been
confederated
all
we
ask
is
to
be
let
alone
that
those
who
never
held
power
over
us
shall
not
now
attempt
our
subjugation
by
arms
this
we
will
we
must
resist
to
the
direst
extremity
the
moment
that
this
pretension
is
abandoned
the
sword
will
drop
from
our
grasp
and
we
shall
be
ready
to
enter
into
treaties
of
amity
and
commerce
that
can
not
but
be
mutually
beneficial
so
long
as
this
pretension
is
maintained
with
a
firm
reliance
on
that
divine
power
which
covers
with
its
protection
the
just
cause
we
must
continue
to
struggle
for
our
inherent
right
to
freedom
independence
and
at
this
session
congress
passed
acts
authorizing
the
president
to
use
the
whole
land
and
naval
force
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
war
thus
commenced
to
issue
to
private
armed
vessels
letters
of
marque
in
addition
to
the
volunteer
force
authorized
to
be
raised
to
accept
the
services
of
volunteers
to
serve
during
the
war
to
receive
into
the
service
various
companies
of
the
different
arms
to
make
a
loan
of
fifty
millions
of
dollars
in
bonds
and
notes
and
to
hold
an
election
for
officers
of
the
permanent
government
under
the
new
constitution
an
act
was
also
passed
to
provide
revenue
from
imports
another
relative
to
prisoners
of
war
and
such
others
as
were
necessary
to
complete
the
internal
organization
of
the
government
and
establish
the
administration
of
public
affairs
in
every
portion
of
the
country
there
was
exhibited
the
most
patriotic
devotion
to
the
common
cause
transportation
companies
freely
tendered
the
use
of
their
lines
for
troops
and
supplies
requisitions
for
troops
were
met
with
such
alacrity
that
the
number
offering
their
services
in
every
instance
greatly
exceeded
the
demand
and
the
ability
to
arm
them
men
of
the
highest
official
and
social
position
served
as
volunteers
in
the
ranks
the
gravity
of
age
and
the
zeal
of
youth
rivaled
each
other
in
the
desire
to
be
foremost
in
the
public
defense
the
appearance
of
the
proclamation
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
calling
out
thousand
men
was
followed
by
the
immediate
withdrawal
of
the
states
of
virginia
north
carolina
tennessee
and
arkansas
and
their
union
with
the
confederate

the
former

thus
placed
on
the

and
exposed
to

began
to
prepare
for
a
resolute
defense

were
ordered
to
be
enrolled

in

the

officer
in

had
evacuated

after
having
attempted
to
destroy
the
public
buildings
there
his
report
says
i
gave
the

to

three
minutes
or
less

of

containing
nearly
fifteen
thousand

with

carpenter
shop
which
was
at
the
upper
end
of
a
long
and
connected
series
of
workshops
of
the
armory
proper
were
in
a
blaze
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
the
destruction
was
complete
simon
cameron
the
secretary
of
war
on
april
replied
to
this
report
in
these
words
i
am
directed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
communicate
to
you
and
through
you
to
the
officers
and
men
under
your
command
at
harper
ferry
armory
the
approbation
of
the
government
of
your
and
their
judicious
conduct
there
and
to
tender
you
and
them
the
thanks
of
the
government
for
the
same
at
the
same
time
the
at
norfolk
was
abandoned
after
an
attempt
to
destroy
it
about
midnight
of
april
a
fire
was
started
in
the
yard
which
continued
to
increase
and
before
daylight
the
work
of
destruction
extended
to
two
immense
one
of
which
contained
the
entire
frame
of
a
ship
and
to
the
long
ranges
of
stores
and
offices
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
the
great
ship
pennsylvania
was
burned
and
the
frigates
merrimac
and
columbus
and
the
delaware
raritan
plymouth
and
germantown
were
sunk
a
vast
amount
of
machinery
valuable
engines
and
chronometers
was
broken
up
and
rendered
entirely
useless
the
value
of
the
property
destroyed
was
estimated
at
several
millions
of
dollars
this
property
thus
destroyed
had
been
accumulated
and
constructed
with
laborious
care
and
skillful
ingenuity
during
a
course
of
years
to
fulfill
one
of
the
objects
of
the
constitution
which
was
expressed
in
these
words
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
see
preamble
of
the
constitution
it
had
belonged
to
all
the
states
in
common
and
to
each
one
equally
with
the
others
if
the
confederate
states
were
still
members
of
the
union
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
asserted
where
can
he
find
a
justification
of
these
acts
in
explanation
of
his
policy
to
the
commissioners
sent
to
him
by
the
virginia
state
convention
he
said
referring
to
his
inaugural
address
as
i
then
and
therein
said
i
now
repeat
the
power
confided
in
me
will
be
used
to
hold
occupy
and
possess
property
and
places
belonging
to
the
government
yet
he
tendered
the
thanks
of
the
government
to
those
who
applied
the
torch
to
destroy
this
property
belonging
as
he
regarded
it
to
the
government
how
unreasonable
how
blind
with
rage
must
have
been
that
administration
of
affairs
which
so
quickly
brought
the
government
to
the
necessity
of
destroying
its
own
means
of
defense
in
order
as
it
publicly
declared
to
maintain
its
life
it
would
seem
as
if
the
passions
that
rule
the
savage
had
taken
possession
of
the
authorities
at
the
united
states
capital
in
the
conflagrations
of
vast
structures
the
wanton
destruction
of
public
property
and
still
more

de
by
the
secretary
of

who
boasted
of
the
power

his
little
bell

personal
liberties

the
people
saw
or
might
have
seen
the
rapid
strides
toward
despotism
made
under
the
mask
of
preserving
the
union
yet
these
and
similar
measures
were
tolerated
because
the
sectional
hate
dominated
in
the
northern
states
over
the
higher
motives
of
constitutional
and
moral
obligation

in

and
presented
his
views
and
the
object
of

hicks
who
in
his
response
december
declared
his
purpose
to
act
in
full
concert
with

states
adding
i
do
not
doubt
the
people
of
maryland
are
ready
to
go
with
the
people
of
those
states
for
weal
or
woe

answer
to
appeals
for
and
against
a
proclamation
assembling
the

in
order
to
have
a
call
for
a

governor
hicks
issued
an
address
in
which
arguing
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
define
the
position
of
maryland
he
wrote
if
the
action
of
the
legislature
would
be
simply
to
declare
that
maryland
was
with
the
south
in
sympathy
and
feeling
that
she
demands
from
the
north
the
repeal
of
offensive
unconstitutional
statutes
and
appeals
to
it
for
new
guarantees
that
she
will
wait
a
reasonable
time
for
the
north
to
purge
her
to
do
justice
to
her
southern
brethren
and
if
her
appeals
are
vain
will
make
common
cause
with
her
sister
border
states
in
resistance
to
tyranny
if
need
be
it
would
only
be
saying
what
the
whole
country
well
knows
etc
on
the
of
april
governor
hicks
issued
a
proclamation
invoking
them
to
preserve
the
peace
and
said
i
assure
the
people
that
no
troops
will
be
sent
from
maryland
unless
it
may
be
for
the
defense
of
the
national
capital
on
the
same
day
mayor
brown
of
the
city
of
baltimore
issued
a
proclamation
in
which
referring
to
that
of
the
governor
above
cited
he
said
i
can
not
withhold
my
expression
of
satisfaction
at
his
resolution
that
no
troops
shall
be
sent
from
maryland
to
the
soil
of
any
other
state
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
capital
was
on
a
site
which
originally
belonged
to
maryland
and
was
ceded
by
her
for
a
special
use
so
that
troops
to
defend
the
capital
might
be
considered
as
not
having
been
sent
out
of
maryland
it
will
be
remembered
that
these
proclamations
were
three
days
after
the
requisition
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
states
which
had
not
seceded
for
their
quota
of
troops
to
serve
in
the
war
about
to
be
inaugurated
against
the
south
and
that
rumors
existed
at
the
time
in
baltimore
that
troops
from
the
northeast
were
about
to
be
sent
through
that
city
toward
the
south
on
the
next
day
the
of
april
a
body
of
troops
arrived
at
the
railroad
depot
the
citizens
assembled
in
large
numbers
and
though
without
arms
disputed
the
passage
through
the
city
they
attacked
the
troops
with
the
loose
stones
found
in
the
street
which
was
undergoing
repair
and
with
such
determination
and
violence
that
some
of
the
soldiers
were
wounded
and
they
fired
upon
the
multitude
killing
a
few
and
wounding
many
the
police
of
baltimore
were
very
active
in
their
efforts
to
prevent
conflict
and
preserve
the
peace
they
rescued
the
baggage
and
munitions
of
the
troops
which
had
been
seized
by
the
multitude
and
the
rear
portion
of
the
troops
was
by
direction
of
governor
hicks
sent
back
to
the
borders
of
the
state
the
troops
who
had
got
through
the
city
took
the
railroad
at
the
southern
depot
and
passed
on
the
militia
of
the
city
was
called
out
and
by
evening
quiet
was
restored
during
the
night
on
a
report
that
more
northern
troops
were
approaching
the
city
by
the
railroads

bridges
nearest
to
the
city
were
destroyed
as
it
was
understood
by
orders
from
the
authorities
of
baltimore

the
of
april
president
lincoln
wrote
in
reply
to
governor
hicks
and

brown
saying
for
the
future
troops
must
be
brought
here
but
i
make
no

bringing

the

brown
and
other
influential
citizens
by
request
of
the
president
visited
him
the
interview
took
place
in
presence
of
the
cabinet
and
general
scott
and
was
reported
to
the
public
by
the
mayor
after
his
return
to
baltimore
from
that
report
i
make
the
following
extracts
referring
to
the
president
the
mayor
uses
the
following
language
the
protection
of
washington
he
asseverated
with
great
earnestness
was
the
sole
object
of
concentrating
troops
there
and
he
protested
that
none
of
the
troops
brought
through
maryland
were
intended
for
any
purposes
hostile
to
the
state
or
aggressive
as
against
the
southern
states
he
called
on
general
scott
for
his
opinion
which
the
general
gave
at
great
length
to
the
effect
that
troops
might
be
brought
through
maryland
without
going
through
baltimore
etc
the
interview
terminated
with
the
distinct
assurance
on
the
part
of
the
president
that
no
more
troops
would
be
sent
through
baltimore
unless
obstructed
in
their
transit
in
other
directions
and
with
the
understanding
that
the
city
authorities
should
do
their
best
to
restrain
their
own
people
the
mayor
and
his
companions
availed
themselves
of
the
president
full
discussion
of
the
questions
of
the
day
to
urge
upon
him
respectfully
but
in
the
most
earnest
manner
a
course
of
policy
which
would
give
peace
to
the
country
and
especially
the
withdrawal
of
all
orders
contemplating
the
passage
of
troops
through
any
part
of
maryland
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
maryland
appointed
commissioners
to
the
confederate
government
to
suggest
to
it
the
cessation
of
impending
hostilities
until
the
meeting
of
congress
at
washington
in
july
commissioners
with
like
instructions
were
also
sent
to
washington
in
my
reply
to
the
commissioners
dated
of
may
i
referred
to
the
uniform
expression
of
desire
for
peace
on
the
part
of
the
confederate
government
and
added
in
deference
to
the
state
of
maryland
it
again
asserts
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
that
its
sincere
and
earnest
desire
is
for
peace
but
that
while
the
government
would
readily
entertain
any
proposition
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
tending
to
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
present
difficulties
the
recent
attempts
of
this
government
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
that
of
the
united
states
were
attended
with
results
which
forbid
any
renewal
of
proposals
from
it
to
that
government
its
policy
can
not
but
be
peace
peace
with
all
nations
and
people
on
the
of
may
the
relay
house
at
the
junction
of
the
washington
and
baltimore
and
ohio
railroads
was
occupied
by
united
states
troops
under
general
butler
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
he
moved
a
portion
of
the
troops
to
baltimore
and
took
position
on
federal
hill
thus
was
consummated
the
military
occupation
of
baltimore
on
the
next
day
reënforcements
were
received
and
on
the
same
day
the
commanding
general
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
citizens
in
which
he
announced
to
them
his
purpose
and
authority
to
discriminate
between
citizens
those
who
agreed
with
him
being
denominated
well
disposed
and
the
others
described
with
many
offensive
epithets
the
initiatory
step
of
the
policy
subsequently
developed
was
found
in
one
sentence
therefore
all
manufacturers
of
arms
and
munitions
of
war
are
hereby
requested
to
report
to
me
forthwith
so
that
the
lawfulness
of
their
occupations
may
be
known
and
understood
and
all
misconstruction
of
their
doings
avoided
there
soon
followed
a
demand
for
the
surrender
of
the
arms
stored
by
the
city
authorities
in
a
warehouse
the
police
refused
to
surrender
them
without
the
orders
of
the
police
commissioners
the
police
commissioners
upon
representation
that
the
demand
of
general
butler
was
by
order
of
the
president
decided
to
surrender
the
arms
under
protest
and
they
were
accordingly
removed
to
fort
mchenry
baltimore
was
now
disarmed
the
army
of
the
united
states
had
control
of
the
city
there
was
no
longer
necessity
to
regard
the
remonstrance
of
baltimore
against
sending
troops
through
the
city
and
that
more
convenient
route
was
henceforth
to
be
employed
george
kane
marshal
of
the
police
of
baltimore
who
had
rendered
most
efficient
service
for
the
preservation
of
peace
as
well
in
the
city
of
baltimore
as
at
locust
point
where
troops
were
disembarked
to
be
dispatched
to
washington
was
arrested
at
home
by
a
military
force
and
sent
to
fort
mchenry
and
a
was
appointed
by
general
banks
who
had
succeeded
to
the
command
the
excuse
given
for
the
arrest
of
marshal
kane
was
that
he
was
believed
to
be
cognizant
of
combinations
of
men
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
unite
with
those
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
government
whether
the
suspicion
were
well
or
ill
founded
it
constituted
a
poor
excuse
for
depriving
a
citizen
of
his
liberty
without
legal
warrant
and
without
proof
but
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
unbridled
despotism
and
a
reign
of
terror
the
mayor
and
police
commissioners
charles
howard
william
gatchell
and
john
davis
held
a
meeting
and
after
preparing
a
protest
against
the
suspension
of
their
functions
in
the
appointment
of
a
resolved
that
while
they
would
do
nothing
to
obstruct
the
execution
of
such
measures
as
banks
may
deem
proper
to
take
on
his
own
responsibility
for
the
preservation
of
the
peace
of
the
city
and
of
public
order
they
can
not
consistently
with
their
views
of
official
duty
and
of
the
obligations
of
their
oaths
of
office
recognize
the
right
of
any
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
police
force
as
such
to
receive
orders
or
directions
from
any
other
authority
than
from
this
board
and
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
the
forcible
suspension
of
their
functions
suspends
at
the
same
time
the
active
operations
of
the
police
law
the
with
the
plenary
powers
conferred
upon
him
commenced
a
system
of
search
and
seizure
in
private
houses
of
arms
and
munitions
of
every
description
on
the
of
july
general

announced
that
in
pursuance
of
orders
issued
from
the
headquarters
at
washington
for
the
preservation
of
the
public
peace
in
this

and
john

if
the
object
had
been
to
preserve
order
by
any
proper
and
legitimate
method
the
effective
means
would
palpably
have
been
to
rely
upon
men
whose
influence
was
known
to
be
great
and
whose
integrity
was
certainly
unquestionable
the
of
the
commissioners

knew
well

was

family
honored
for
their
public
services
and
himself
adorned
by
every
social
virtue
old
unambitious
hospitable
gentle
loving
he
was
beloved
by
the
people
among
whom
his
long
life
had
been
passed
could
such
a
man
be
the
just
object
of
suspicion
if
when
laws
had
been
silenced
suspicion
could
justify
arrest
and
imprisonment
those
who
knew
him
will
accept
as
a
just
description
in
action
faithful
and
in
honor
clear
who
broke
no
promise
served
no
private
end
who
gained
no
title
and
who
lost
no
friend
thenceforward
arrests
of
the
most
illustrious
became
the
rule
in
a
land
where
freedom
of
speech
was
held
to
be
an
unquestioned
right
freedom
of

ceased
to
exist

the
most
earnest
manner
to
the
whole

to
take
warnings
by

then
went

which
thereby
left

senator

to

senate
reciting
the
outrage
inflicted
upon
maryland
in
the
persons
of
her
municipal

citizens
and
after

merely
obtained
an

governor
hicks
whose

had
been
so
cheering
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
sent
his
final
message
to
the
legislature
on

in
that
referring
to
the
action
of
the
maryland
legislature
at
its
several
sessions
before
that
when
the
arrest
of
its
members
prevented
an
organization
he
wrote
this
continued
until
the
general
government
had
ample
reason
to
believe
it
was
about
to
go
through
the
farce
of
enacting
an
ordinance
of
secession
when
the
treason
was
summarily
stopped
by
the
dispersion
of
the
traitors
after
referring
to
the
elections
of
the
of
june
and
the
of
november
he
says
the
people
have
declared
in
the
most
emphatic
tones
what
i
have
never
doubted
that
maryland
has
no
sympathy
with
the
rebellion
and
desires
to
do
her
full
share
in
the
duty
of
suppressing
it
it
would
be
more
easy
than
gracious
to
point
out
the
inconsistency
between
his
first
statements
and
this
last
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
he
kept
himself
in
equipoise
and
fell
at
last
as
men
without
convictions
usually
do
upon
the
stronger
side
henceforth
the
story
of
maryland
is
sad
to
the
last
degree
only
relieved
by
the
gallant
men
who
left
their
homes
to
fight
the
battle
of
state
rights
when
maryland
no
longer
furnished
them
a
field
on
which
they
could
maintain
the
rights
their
fathers
left
them
this
was
a
fate
doubly
sad
to
the
sons
of
the
heroic
men
who
under
the
designation
of
the
maryland
line
did
so
much
in
our
revolutionary
struggle
to
secure
the
independence
of
the
states
of
the
men
who
at
a
later
day
fought
the
battle
of
north
point
of
the
people
of
a
land
which
had
furnished
so
many
heroes
and
statesmen
and
gave
the
great
taney
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
though
maryland
did
not
become
one
of
the
confederate
states
she
was
endeared
to
the
people
thereof
by
many
most
enduring
ties
last
in
order
but
first
in
cordiality
were
the
tender
ministrations
of
her
noble
daughters
to
the
sick
and
wounded
prisoners
who
were
carried
through
the
streets
of
baltimore
and
it
is
with
shame
we
remember
that
brutal
guards
on
several
occasions
inflicted
wounds
upon
gentlewomen
who
approached
these
suffering
prisoners
to
offer
them
the
relief
of
which
they
so
evidently
stood
in
need
the
accumulation
of
northern
forces
at
and
near
washington
city
made
it
evident
that
the
great
effort
of
the
invasion
would
be
from
that
point
while
assaults
of
more
or
less
vigor
might
be
expected
upon
all
important
places
which
the
enemy
by
his
facilities
for
transportation
could
reach
the
concentration
of
confederate
troops
in
virginia
was
begun
and
they
were
sent
forward
as
rapidly
as
practicable
to
the
points
threatened
with
attack
it
was
soon
manifest
that
besides
the
army
at
washington
which
threatened
virginia
there
was
a
second
one
at
chambersburg
pennsylvania
under
patterson
designed
to
move
through
williamsport
and
martinsburg
and
another
forming
in
ohio
under
the
command
of
mcclellan
destined
to
invade
the
western
counties
of
virginia
this
latter
force
having
landed
at
wheeling
on
may
advanced
as
far
as
grafton
on
the
at
this
time
colonel
porterfield
with
the
small
force
of
seven
hundred
men
sent
forward
by
governor
letcher
of
virginia
was
at
philippi
on
the
night
of
june
he
was
attacked
by
general
mcclellan
with
a
strong
force
and
withdrew
to
laurel
hill
reënforcements
under
general
garnett
were
sent
forward
and
occupied
the
hill
while
colonel
pegram
the
second
in
command
held
rich
mountain
on
july
the
latter
was
attacked
by
two
columns
of
the
enemy
and
after
a
vigorous
defense
fell
back
on
the
losing
many
of
his
men
who
were
made
prisoners
general
garnett
hearing
of
this
reverse
attempted
to
fall
back
but
was
pursued
by
mcclellan
and
while
striving
to
rally
his
rear
guard
was
killed
five
hundred
of
his
men
were
taken
prisoners
this
success
left
the
northern
forces
in
possession
of
that
region
the
difficult
character
of
the
country
in
which
the
battle
was
fought
as
well
from
mountain
acclivity
as
dense
wood
rendered
a
minute
knowledge
of
the
roads
of
vast
importance
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
competent
guides
led
the
enemy
by
roads
unknown
to
our
army
to
the
flank
and
rear
of
its
position
and
thus
caused
the
sacrifice
of
those
who
had
patriotically
come
to
repel
the
invasion
of
the
very
people
who
furnished
the
guides
to
the
enemy
it
was
treachery
confounding
the
counsels
of
the
brave
thus
occurred
the
disaster
of
rich
mountain
and
laurel
hill
general
robert
garnett
was
a
native
of
virginia
and
a
graduate
of
the
united
states
military
academy
he
served
in
mexico
on
the
staff
of
general
taylor
and
was
conspicuous
for
gallantry
and
good
conduct
especially
in
the
battles
of
monterey
and
buena
vista
recognizing
his
allegiance
as
due
to
the
state
of
virginia
from
which
he
was
appointed
a
cadet
and
thence
won
his
various
promotions
in
the
army
he
resigned
his
commission
when
the
state
withdrew
from
the
union
and
earnestly
and
usefully
served
as
to
general
lee
the
of
the
army
of
virginia
until
she
acceded
to
the
confederacy
when
western
virginia
was
invaded
he
offered
his
services
to
go
to
her
defense
and
relying
confidently
on
the
sentiment
so
strong
in
his
own
heart
of
devotion
to
the
state
by
all
virginians
he
believed
it
was
only
needful
for
him
to
have
a
nucleus
around
which
the
people
could
rally
to
resist
the
invasion
of
their
country
how
sadly
he
was
disappointed
and
how
bravely
he
struggled
against
adverse
fortune
and
how
gallantly
he
died
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
are
memories
which
though
sad
bear
with
them
to
his
friends
the
consolation
that
the
manner
of
his
death
was
worthy
of
the
way
in
which
he
lived
and
that
even
his
life
was
an
offering
he
was
not
unwilling
to
make
for
the
welfare
and
honor
of
virginia
he
fell
while
commanding
the
rear
guard
to
save
his
retreating
army
thus
exemplifying
the
highest
quality
of
man
for
others
and
such
devotion
and
fortitude
as

any
public
emergency
should
render
it
impolitic
to
meet
in
richmond
he
should
call
the
congress
together
at
some
other
place
to
be
selected
by
him
the
hostile
demonstrations
of
the
united
states
government
against
virginia
caused
the
president
at
an
early
day
after
the
adjournment
of
congress
to
proceed
to
richmond
and
to
direct
the
executive
departments
with
their
archives
to
be
removed
to
that
place
as
soon
as
could
be
conveniently
done
in
the
message
delivered
to
the
congress
at
its
meeting
in
richmond
according
to
adjournment
i
gave
the
following
explanation
of
my
conduct
under
the
resolution
above
cited
immediately
after
your
adjournment
the
aggressive
movement
of
the
enemy
required
prompt
energetic
action
the
accumulation
of
his
forces
on
the
potomac
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
his
efforts
were
to
be
directed
against
virginia
and
from
no
point
could
necessary
measures
for
her
defense
and
protection
be
so
effectively
decided
as
from
her
own
capital
on
my
arrival
in
richmond
general
lee
as
commander
of
the
army
of
virginia
was
found
there
where
he
had
established
his
headquarters
he
possessed
my
unqualified
confidence
both
as
a
soldier
and
a
patriot
and
the
command
he
had
exercised
over
the
army
of
virginia
before
her
accession
to
the
confederacy
gave
him
that
special
knowledge
which
at
the
time
was
most
needful
as
has
been
already
briefly
stated
troops
had
previously
been
sent
from
other
states
of
the
confederacy
to
the
aid
of
virginia
the
forces
there
assembled
were
divided
into
three
armies
at
positions
the
most
important
and
threatened
one
under
general
johnston
at
harper
ferry
covering
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
another
under
general
beauregard
at
manassas
covering
the
direct
approach
from
washington
to
richmond
and
the
third
under
generals
huger
and
magruder
at
norfolk
and
on
the
peninsula
between
the
james
and
york
rivers
covering
the
approach
to
richmond
from
the
seaboard
the
first
and
second
of
these
armies
though
separated
by
the
blue
ridge
had
such
practicable
communication
with
each
other
as
to
render
their
junction
possible
when
the
necessity
should
be
foreseen
they
both
were
confronted
by
forces
greatly
superior
in
numbers
to
their
own
and
it
was
doubtful
which
would
first
be
the
object
of
attack
ferry
was
an
important
position
both
for
military
and
political
considerations
and
though
unfavorably
situated
for
defense
against
an
enemy
which
should
seek
to
turn
its
position
by
crossing
the
potomac
above
it
was
desirable
to
hold
it
as
long
as
was
consistent
with
safety
the
temporary
occupation
was
especially
needful
for
the
removal
of
the
valuable
machinery
and
material
in
the
armory
located
there
and
which
the
enemy
had
failed
to
destroy
though
he
had
for
that
purpose
fired
the
buildings
before
his
evacuation
of
the
post
the
demonstrations
of
general
patterson
commanding
the
federal
army
in
that
region
caused
general
johnston
earnestly
to
insist
on
being
allowed
to
retire
to
a
position
nearer
to
winchester
under
these
circumstances
an
official
letter
was
addressed
to
him
from
which
the
following
extract
is
made
adjutant
and
office
richmond
general
johnston
harper
ferry
sir
you
had
been
heretofore
instructed
to
exercise
your
discretion
as
to
retiring
from
your
position
at
harper
ferry
and
taking
the
field
to
check
the
advance
of
the
enemy
the
ineffective
portion
of
your
command
together
with
the
baggage
and
whatever
else
would
impede
your
operations
in
the
field
it
would
be
well
to
send
without
delay
to
the
manassas
road
should
you
not
be
sustained
by
the
population
of
the
valley
so
as
to
enable
you
to
turn
upon
the
enemy
before
reaching
winchester
you
will
continue
slowly
to
retire
to
the
manassas
road
upon
some
of
the
passes
of
which
it
is
hoped
you
will
be
able
to
make
an
effective
stand
even
against
a
very
superior
force
to
this
end
it
might
be
well
to
send
your
engineer
to
make
a
reconnaissance
and
construct
such
temporary
works
as
may
be
useful
and
proper
for
these
reasons
it
has
been
with
reluctance
that
any
attempt
was
made
to
give
you
specific
instructions
and
you
will
accept
assurances
of
the
readiness
with
which
the
freest
exercise
of
discretion
on
your
part
will
be
sustained
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
signed
cooper
and
the
earliest
combat
in
this
quarter
and
which
in
the
inexperience
of
the
time
was
regarded
as
a
great
battle
may
claim
a
passing
notice
as
exemplifying
the
extent
to
which
the
individuality
and
habitual
use
of
by
the
people
of
the
south
was
a
substitute
for
military
training
and
on
the
other
hand
how
the
want
of
such
training
made
the
northern
new
levies
inferior
to
the
like
kind
of
southern
troops
a
detached
work
on
the
right
of
general
magruder
line
was
occupied
june
by
the
first
regiment
of
north
carolina
volunteers
and
three
hundred
and
sixty
virginians
under
the
command
of
an
educated
vigilant
and
gallant
soldier
then
colonel
hill
first
regiment
north
carolina
volunteers
subsequently
a
in
the
confederate
service
he
reports
that
this
small
force
was
engaged
for
five
and
a
half
hours
with
four
and
a
half
regiments
of
the
enemy
at
bethel
church
nine
miles
from
hampton
the
enemy
made
three
distinct
and
charges
but
were
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
our
cavalry
pursued
them
for
six
miles
when
their
retreat
became
a
total
rout
on
the
other
side
frederick
townsend
colonel
of
third
regiment
of
the
enemy
forces
after
stating
with
much
minuteness
the
orders
and
line
of
march
describes
how
about
five
or
six
miles
from
hampton
a
heavy
and
fire
of
canister
and
was
opened
upon
the
regiment
and
how
it
was
afterward
discovered
to
be
a
portion
of
their
own
column
which
had
fired
upon
them
after
due
care
for
the
wounded
and
a
recognition
of
their
friends
the
column
proceeded
and
the
colonel
describes
his
regiment
as
moving
to
the
attack
in
line
of
battle
as
if
on
parade
in
the
face
of
a
severe
fire
of
artillery
and
subsequently
the
description
proceeds
a
company
of
my
regiment
had
been
separated
from
the
regiment
by
a
ditch
and
marched
in
the
adjoining
field
in
line
with
the
main
body
not
being
aware
of
the
separation
of
that
company
the
colonel
states
that
therefore
upon
seeing
among
the
breaks
in
the
hedge
the
glistening
of
bayonets
in
the
adjoining
field
i
immediately
concluded
that
the
enemy
were
outflanking
and
conceived
it
to
be
my
duty
to
immediately
retire
and
repel
that
advance
without
knowing
anything
of
the
subsequent
career
of
the
colonel
from
whose
report
these
extracts
have
been
made
or
of
the
officers
who
opened
fire
upon
him
while
he
was
marching
to
the
execution
of
the
orders
under
which
they
were
all
acting
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
after
a
few
months
experience
such
scenes
as
are
described
could
not
have
occurred
and
these
citations
have
been
made
to
show
the
value
of
military
training
in
further
exemplification
of
the
difference
between
the
troops
of
the
confederate
states
and
those
of
the
united
states
before
either
had
been
trained
in
war
i
will
cite
an
affair
which
occurred
on
the
upper
potomac
colonel
hill
commanding
a
brigade
at
romney
in
western
virginia
having
learned
that
the
enemy
had
a
command
at
the
bridge
on
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
decided
to
attack
it
and
to
destroy
the
bridge
so
as
to
interrupt
the
use
of
that
important
line
of
the
enemy
communication
for
this
purpose
he
ordered
colonel
john
vaughn
of
the
third
tennessee
volunteers
to
proceed
with
a
detachment
of
two
companies
of
his
regiment
and
two
companies
of
the
thirteenth
virginia
volunteers
to
the
position
where
the
enemy
were
reported
to
be
posted
colonel
vaughn
reports
that
on
june
at
he
moved
with
his
command
as
ordered
marched
eighteen
miles
and
at
the
next
morning
found
the
enemy
on
the
north
bank
of
the
potomac
in
some
strength
of
infantry
and
with
two
pieces
of
artillery
he
had
no
after
reconnaissance
the
order
to
charge
was
given
it
was
necessary
in
the
execution
of
the
order
to
ford
the
river
which
colonel
vaughn
reports
was
gallantly
executed
in
good
order
but
with
great
enthusiasm
as
we
appeared
in
sight
at
a
distance
of
four
hundred
yards
the
enemy
broke
and
fled
in
all
directions
firing
as
they
ran
only
a
few
random
shots
the
enemy
did
not
wait
to
fire
their
artillery
which
we
captured
both
guns
loaded
they
were
however
spiked
by
the
enemy
before
he
fled
from
the
best
information
their
number
was
between
two
and
three
hundred
colonel
vaughn
further
states
that
in
pursuance
of
orders
he
fired
the
bridge
and
then
retired
bringing
away
the
two
guns
and
the
flag
and
other
articles
of
little
value
which
had
been
captured
and
arrived
at
brigade
headquarters
in
the
evening
with
his
command
in
high
spirits
good
condition
colonel
hill
the
energetic
brigade
commander
who
directed
this
expedition
left
the
united
states
army
when
the
state
which
had
given
him
to
the
military
service
of
the
general
government
passed
her
ordinance
of
secession
the
vigilance
and
enterprise
he
manifested
on
this
early
occasion
in
the
war
of
the
states
gave
promise
of
the
brilliant
career
which
gained
for
him
the
high
rank
of
a
and
which
there
was
nothing
for
his
friends
to
regret
save
the
honorable
death
which
he
met
upon
the
field
of
battle
colonel
vaughn
the
commander
of
the
detachment
was
new
to
war
his
paths
had
been
those
of
peace
and
his
home
in
the
mountains
of
east
tennessee
might
reasonably
have
secured
him
from
any
expectation
that
it
would
ever
be
the
theatre
on
which
armies
were
to
contend
and
that
he
in
the
mutation
of
human
affairs
would
become
a
soldier
he
lived
until
the
close
of
the
war
and
on
larger
fields
than
that
on
which
he
first
appeared
proved
that
though
not
educated
for
a
soldier
he
had
endowments
which
compensated
for
that
disadvantage
the
activity
and
vigilance
of
stuart
afterward
so
distinguished
as
commander
of
cavalry
in
the
army
of
virginia
and
the
skill
and
daring
of
jackson
soon
by
greater
deeds
to
become
immortal
checked
punished
and
embarrassed
the
enemy
in
his
threatened
advances
and
his
movements
became
so
devoid
of
a
definite
purpose
that
one
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
the
object
of
his
campaign
unless
it
was
to
detain
general
johnston
with
his
forces
in
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
while
general
mcdowell
profiting
by
the
feint
should
make
the
real
attack
upon
general
beauregard
army
at
manassas
however
that
may
be
the
evidence
finally
became
conclusive
that
the
enemy
under
general
mcdowell
was
moving
to
attack
the
army
under
general
beauregard
the
contingency
had
therefore
arisen
for
that
junction
which
was
necessary
to
enable
us
to
resist
the
vastly
superior
numbers
of
our
assailant
for
though
the
most
strenuous
and
not
wholly
unsuccessful
exertions
had
been
made
to
reënforce
both
the
armies
of
the
shenandoah
and
of
the
potomac
they
yet
remained
far
smaller
than
those
of
the
enemy
confronting
them
and
made
a
junction
of
our
forces
indispensable
whenever
the
real
point
of
attack
should
be
ascertained
for
this
movement
we
had
the
advantage
of
an
interior
line
so
that
if
the
enemy
should
discover
it
after
it
commenced
he
could
not
counteract
it
by
adopting
the
same
tactics
the
success
of
this
policy
it
will
readily
be
perceived
depended
upon
the
time
of
execution
for
though
from
different
causes
failure
would
equally
result
if
done
too
soon
or
too
late
the
determination
as
to
which
army
should
be
reënforced
from
the
other
and
the
exact
time
of
the
transfer
must
have
been
a
difficult
problem
as
both
the
generals
appear
to
have
been
unable
to
solve
it
each
asking
reënforcements
from
the
other
on
the
of
july
general
johnston
wrote
an
official
letter
from
which
i
make
the
following
extracts
headquarters
winchester
general
similar
information
from
other
sources
gives
me
the
impression
that
the
reënforcements
arriving
at
martinsburg
amount
to
seven
or
eight
thousand
i
have
estimated
the
force
hitherto
you
may
remember
at
eighteen
thousand
additional
artillery
has
also
been
received
they
were
greatly
superior
to
us
in
that
arm
before
the
object
of
reënforcing
general
patterson
must
be
an
advance
upon
this
place
fighting
here
against
great
odds
seems
to
me
more
prudent
than
retreat
i
have
not
asked
for
reënforcements
because
i
supposed
that
the
war
department
informed
of
the
state
of
affairs
everywhere
could
best
judge
where
the
troops
at
its
disposal
are
most
required
most
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
signed
joseph
johnston
if
it
is
proposed
to
strengthen
us
against
the
attack
i
suggest
as
soon
to
be
made
it
seems
to
me
that
general
beauregard
might
with
furnish
five
or
six
thousand
men
for
a
few
days
e
j
as
soon
as
i
became
satisfied
that
manassas
was
the
objective
point
of
the
enemy
movement
i
wrote
to
general
johnston
urging
him
to
make
preparations
for
a
junction
with
general
beauregard
and
to
his
objections
and
the
difficulties
he
presented
replied
at
great
length
endeavoring
to
convince
him
that
the
troops
he
described
as
embarrassing
a
hasty
march
might
be
withdrawn
in
advance
of
the
more
effective
portion
of
his
command
writing
with
entire
confidence
i
kept
no
copy
of
my
letters
and
when
subsequent
events
caused
the
wish
to
refer
to
them
i
requested
general
johnston
to
send
me
copies
of
them
he
replied
that
his
tent
had
been
blown
down
and
his
papers
had
been
scattered
his
letters
to
me
which
would
show
the
general
purport
of
mine
to
him
have
shared
the
fate
which
during
or
soon
after
the
close
of
the
war
befell
most
of
the
correspondence
i
had
preserved
and
his
retained
copies
if
still
in
his
possession
do
not
appear
to
have
been
deemed
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
inserted
in
his
published
narrative
on
the
of
july
the
following
telegram
was
sent
by
the
richmond
general
johnston
general
beauregard
is
attacked
to
strike
the

a
decisive
blow
a
junction
of
all
your
effective
force

be
needed
if
practicable
make

movement

your
sick
and
baggage
to
culpepper
either
by
railroad
or
by
warrenton
in
all
the
arrangements
exercise
your
discretion
signed
cooper
and
the
confidence
reposed
in
general
johnston
sufficiently
evinced
by
the
important
command
intrusted
to
him
was
more
than
equal
to
the
expectation
that
he
would
do
all
that
was
practicable
to
execute
the
order
for
a
junction
as
well
as
to
secure
his
sick
and
baggage
for
the
execution
of
the
one
great
purpose
that
he
would
allow
no
minor
question
to
interfere
with
that
which
was
of
vital
importance
and
for
which
he
was
informed
all
his
effective
force
would
be
needed
the
order
referred
to
was
the
telegram
inserted
above
in
which
the
sending
the
sick
to
culpepper
might
have
been
after
or
before
the
effective
force
had
moved
to
the
execution
of
the
main
and
only
positive
part
of
the
order
all
the
arrangements
were
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
general
it
seems
strange
that
any
one
has
construed
this
expression
as
meaning
that
the
movement
for
a
junction
was
left
to
the
discretion
of
that
officer
and
that
the
forming
of
a
junction
the
imperious
necessity
should
have
been
termed
in
the
order
all
the
arrangement
instead
of
referring
that
word
to
its
proper
connection
the
route
and
mode
of
transportation
the
general
had
no
margin
on
which
to
institute
a
comparison
as
to
the
importance
of
his
remaining
in
the
valley
according
to
his
previous
assignment
or
going
where
he
was
ordered
by
competent
authority
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
state
that
from
all
the
accounts
received
at
the
time
the
plans
of
general
johnston
for
masking
his
withdrawal
to
form
a
junction
with
general
beauregard
were
conducted
with
marked
skill
and
though
all
of
his
troops
did
not
arrive
as
soon
as
expected
and
needed
he
has
satisfactorily
shown
that
the
failure
was
not
due
to
any
defect
in
his
arrangements
for
their
transportation
the
great
question
of
uniting
the
two
armies
had
been
decided
at
richmond
the
time
and
place
depended
on
the
enemy
and
when
it
was
seen
that
the
real
attack
was
to
be
against
the
position
at
manassas
the
order
was
sent
to
general
johnston
to
move
to
that
point
his
letters
of
the
and
instant
expressed
his
doubts
about
his
power
to
retire
from
before
the
superior
force
of
general
patterson
therefore
the
word
practicable
was
in
this
connection
the
equivalent
of
possible
that
it
was
at
the
time
so
understood
by
general
johnston
is
shown
by
his
reply
to
the
telegram
headquarters
winchester
general
i
have
had
the
honor
to
receive
your
telegram
of
yesterday
general
patterson
who
had
been
at
bunker
hill
since
monday
seems
to
have
moved
yesterday
to
charlestown
miles
to
the
east
of
winchester
unless
he
prevents
it
we
shall
move
toward
general
beauregard
signed
joseph
johnston
general
s
cooper
after
general
johnston
commenced
his
march
to
manassas
he
sent
to
me
a
telegram
the
substance
of
which
as
my
memory
serves
and
the
reply
indicates
was
an
inquiry
as
to
the
relative
position
he
would
occupy
toward
general
beauregard
i
returned
the
following
answer
richmond
general
johnston
junction
you
are
a
general
in
the
confederate
army
possessed
of
the
power
attaching
to
that
rank
you
will
know
how
to
make
the
exact
knowledge
of
beauregard
as
well
of
the
ground
as
of
the
troops
and
preparation
avail
for
the
success
of
the
object
in
which
you
coöperate
the
zeal
of
both
assures
me
of
harmonious
action
signed
jefferson
davis
general
johnston
by
his
promotion
to
the
grade
of
general
as
well
as
his
superior
rank
as
a
brigadier
over
beauregard
gave
him
precedence
so
there
was
no
need
to
ask
which
of
the
two
would
command
the
whole
when
their
troops
should
join
and
do
duty
together
therefore
his
inquiry
as
it
was
revolved
in
my
mind
created
an
anxiety
not
felt
before
lest
there
should
be
some
unfortunate
complication
or
misunderstanding
between
these
officers
when
their
forces
should
be
united
regarding
the
combat
of
the
of
july
as
the
precursor
of
a
battle
i
decided
at
the
earliest
moment
to
go
in
person
to
the
army
as
has
been
heretofore
stated
congress
was
to
assemble
on
the
of
july
to
hold
its
first
session
at
the
new
capital
richmond
virginia
my
presence
on
that
occasion
and
the
delivery
of
a
message
were
required
by
usage
and
law
after
the
delivery
of
the
message
to
congress
on
saturday
the
of
july
i
intended
to
leave
in
the
afternoon
for
manassas
but
was
detained
until
the
next
morning
when
i
left
by
rail
accompanied
by
my
colonel
davis
to
confer
with
the
generals
on
the
field
as
we
approached
manassas
railroad
junction
a
cloud
of
dust
was
visible
a
short
distance
to
the
west
of
the
railroad
it
resembled
one
raised
by
a
body
of
marching
troops
and
recalled
to
my
remembrance
the
design
of
general
beauregard
to
make
the
rappahannock
his
second
line
of
defense
it
was
however
subsequently
learned
that
the
dust
was
raised
by
a
number
of
wagons
which
had
been
sent
to
the
rear
for
greater
security
against
the
contingencies
of
the
battle
the
sound
of
the
firing
had
now
become
very
distinct
so
much
so
as
to
leave
no
doubt
that
a
general
engagement
had
commenced
though
that
event
had
been
anticipated
as
being
near
at
hand
after
the
action
of
the
it
was
both
hoped
and
desired
that
it
would
not
occur
quite
so
soon
the
more
so
as
it
was
not
known
whether
the
troops
from
the
valley
had
yet
arrived
on
reaching
the
railroad
junction
i
found
a
large
number
of
men
bearing
the
usual
evidence
of
those
who
leave
the
field
of
battle
under
a
panic
they
crowded
around
the
train
with
fearful
stories
of
a
defeat
of
our
army
the
railroad
conductor
announced
his
decision
that
the
railroad
train
should
proceed
no
farther
looking
among
those
who
were
about
us
for
one
whose
demeanor
gave
reason
to
expect
from
him
a
collected
answer
i
selected
one
whose
gray
beard
and
calm
face
gave
best
assurance
he
however
could
furnish
no
encouragement
our
line
he
said
was
broken
all
was
confusion
the
army
routed
and
the
battle
lost
i
asked
for
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
he
said
they
were
on
the
field
when
he
left
it
i
returned
to
the
conductor
and
told
him
that
i
must
go
on
that
the
railroad
was
the
only
means
by
which
i
could
proceed
and
that
until
i
reached
the
headquarters
i
could
not
get
a
horse
to
ride
to
the
field
where
the
battle
was
ragging
he
finally
consented
to
detach
the
locomotive
from
the
train
and
for
my
accommodation
to
run
it
as
far
as
the
army
headquarters
in
this
manner
colonel
davis
and
myself
proceeded
at
the
headquarters
we
found
the
quartermaster
general
cabell
and
the
jordan
of
general
beauregard
staff
who
courteously
agreed
to
furnish
us
horses
and
also
to
show
us
the
route
while
the
horses
were
being
prepared
colonel
jordan
took
occasion
to
advise
my
colonel
davis
of
the
hazard
of
going
to
the
field
and
the
impropriety
of
such
exposure
on
my
part
the
horses
were
after
a
time
reported
ready
and
we
started
to
the
field
the
stragglers
soon
became
numerous
and
warnings
as
to
the
fate
which
awaited
us
if
we
advanced
were
not
only
frequent
but
evidently
sincere
there
were
however
many
who
turned
back
and
the
wounded
generally
cheered
upon
meeting
us
i
well
remember
one
a
mere
stripling
who
supported
on
the
shoulders
of
a
man
who
was
bearing
him
to
the
rear
took
off
his
cap
and
waved
it
with
a
cheer
that
showed
within
that
slender
form
beat
the
heart
of
a
hero
breathed
a
spirit
that
would
dare
the
labors
of
hercules
as
we
advanced
the
storm
of
the
battle
was
rolling
westward
and
its
fury
became
more
faint
when
i
met
general
johnston
who
was
upon
a
hill
which
commanded
a
general
view
of
the
field
of
the
operations
and
inquired
of
him
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
he
replied
that
we
had
won
the
battle
i
left
him
there
and
rode
still
farther
to
the
west
several
of
the
volunteers
on
general
beauregard
staff
joined
me
and
a
command
of
cavalry
the
gallant
leader
of
which
captain
john
lay
insisted
that
i
was
too
near
the
enemy
to
be
without
an
escort
we
however
only
saw
one
column
near
to
us
that
created
a
doubt
as
to
which
side
it
belonged
and
as
we
were
riding
toward
it
it
was
suggested
that
we
should
halt
until
it
could
be
examined
with
a
colonel
chesnut
dismounted
so
as
the
better
to
use
his
glass
and
at
that
moment
the
column
formed
into
line
by
which
the
wind
struck
the
flag
so
as
to
extend
it
and
it
was
plainly
revealed
to
be
that
of
the
united
states
our
cavalry
though
there
was
present
but
the
squadron
previously
mentioned
and
from
a
statement
of
the
commander
of
which
i
will
make
some
extracts
dashed
boldly
forward
to
charge
the
demonstration
was
followed
by
the
immediate
retreat
of
what
was
i
believe
the
last
thereabout
of
the
enemy
forces
maintaining
their
organization
and
showing
a
disposition
to
dispute
the
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
in
riding
over
the
ground
it
seemed
quite
possible
to
mark
the
line
of
a
fugitive
flight
here
was
a
musket
there
a
there
a
blanket
or
overcoat
a
haversack
as
if
the
runner
had
stripped
himself
as
he
went
of
all
impediments
to
speed
as
we
approached
toward
the
left
of
our
line
the
signs
of
an
utter
rout
of
the
enemy
were
unmistakable
and
justified
the
conclusion
that
the
watchword
of
on
to
richmond
had
been
changed
to
off
for
washington
on
the
extreme
left
of
our
field
of
operations
i
found
the
troops
whose
opportune
arrival
had
averted
impending
disaster
and
had
so
materially
contributed
to
our
victory
some
of
them
had
after
arriving
at
the
manassas
railroad
junction
hastened
to
our
left
their
smith
was
wounded
soon
after
getting
into
action
and
the
command
of
the
brigade
devolved
upon
elzy
by
whom
it
was
gallantly
and
skillfully
led
to
the
close
of
the
battle
others
under
the
command
of
general
then
colonel
early
made
a
rapid
march
under
the
pressing
necessity
from
the
extreme
right
of
our
line
to
and
beyond
our
left
so
as
to
attack
the
enemy
in
flank
thus
inflicting
on
him
the
discomfiture
his
oblique
movement
was
designed
to
inflict
on
us
all
these
troops
and
the
others
near
to
them
had
hastened
into
action
without
supplies
or
weary
hungry
and
without
shelter
night
closed
around
them
where
they
stood
the
victors
on
a
field
it
was
reported
to
me
that
some
of
the
troops
had
been
so
long
without
food
as
to
be
suffering
severe
hunger
and
that
no
supplies
could
be
got
where
they
were
i
made
several
addresses
to
them
all
to
the
effect
that
their
position
was
that
best
adapted
to
a
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
that
they
should
therefore
remain
there
adding
that
i
would
go
to
the
headquarters
and
direct
that
supplies
should
be
sent
to
them
promptly
general
then
colonel
early
commanding
a
brigade
informed
me
of
some
wounded
who
required
attention
one
colonel
gardner
was
he
said
at
a
house
not
far
from
where
we
were
i
rode
to
see
him
found
him
in
severe
pain
and
from
the
twitching
visible
and
frequent
seemed
to
be
threatened
with
tetanus
a
man
sat
beside
him
whose
uniform
was
that
of
the
enemy
but
he
was
gentle
and
appeared
to
be
solicitously
attentive
he
said
that
he
had
no
morphine
and
did
not
know
where
to
get
any
i
found
in
a
short
time
a
surgeon
who
went
with
me
to
colonel
gardner
having
the
articles
necessary
in
the
case
before
leaving
colonel
gardner
he
told
me
that
the
man
who
was
attending
to
him
might
without
hindrance
have
retreated
with
his
comrades
but
had
kindly
remained
with
him
and
he
therefore
asked
my
protection
for
the
man
i
took
the
name
and
the
state
of
the
supposed
good
samaritan
and
at
army
headquarters
directed
that
he
should
not
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
the
sequel
will
be
told
hereafter
it
was
then
late
and
we
rode
back
in
the
night
say
seven
miles
to
the
army
headquarters
i
had
not
seen
general
beauregard
on
the
field
and
did
not
find
him
at
his
quarters
when
we
returned
the
promise
made
to
the
troops
was
therefore
communicated
to
a
who
said
he
would
have
the
supplies
sent
out
at
a
later
hour
when
i
met
general
beauregard
and
informed
him
of
what
had
occurred
he
stated
that
because
of
a
false
alarm
which
had
reached
him
he
had
ordered
the
troops
referred
to
from
the
left
to
the
right
of
our
line
so
as
to
be
in
position
to
repel
the
reported
movement
of
the
enemy
against
that
flank
that
such
an
alarm
should
have
been
credited
and
a
night
march
ordered
on
account
of
it
shows
how
little
the
completeness
of
the
victory
was
realized

of

resolutions
of

to
increase

efficiency
of

army
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
i
had
a
conference
with
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
the
of
the
latter
colonel
jordan
was
present
and
sat
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
when
after
some
preliminary
conversation
i
asked
whether
any
troops
had
been
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
i
was
answered
in
the
negative
upon
further
inquiry
as
to
what
troops
were
in
the
best
position
for
pursuit
and
had
been
least
fatigued
during
the
day
general
brigade
was
named
i
then
suggested
that
he
should
be
ordered
in
pursuit
a
pause
ensued
until
colonel
jordan
asked
me
if
i
would
dictate
the
order
i
at
once
dictated
an
order
for
immediate
pursuit
some
conversation
followed
the
result
of
which
was
a
modification
of
the
order
by
myself
so
that
instead
of
immediate
pursuit
it
should
be
commenced
at
early
dawn
colonel
jordan
spoke
across
the
table
to
me
saying
if
you
will
send
the
order
as
you
first
dictated
it
the
enemy
wo
stop
till
he
gets
into
the
potomac
i
believe
i
remember
the
words
very
nearly
and
am
quite
sure
that
i
do
remember
them
substantially
on
the
of
march
i
wrote
to
general
beauregard
as
follows
dear
sir
permit
me
to
ask
you
to
recall
the
conference
held
between
general
johnston
yourself
and
myself
on
the
night
after
the
close
of
the
battle
of
manassas
and
to
give
me
if
you
can
a
copy
of
the
order
which
i
dictated
and
which
your
jordan
wrote
at
my
dictation
directing
bonham
to
follow
the
retreating
enemy
if
you
can
not
furnish
a
copy
of
the
order
please
give
me
your
recollection
of
its
substance
yours
respectfully
signed
jefferson
davis
to
this
letter
general
beauregard
courteously
replied
that
his
was
in
new
york
in
the
hands
of
a
friend
to
whom
he
would
write
for
a
copy
of
the
order
desired
if
it
should
be
in
said
book
and
that
he
would
also
write
to
his
adjutant
general
jordan
for
his
recollection
of
the
order
if
it
had
not
been
inscribed
in
the
on
the
of
april
general
beauregard
forwarded
to
me
the
answer
to
his
inquiries
in
my
behalf
as
follows
new
york
broadway
my
dear
general
in
answer
to
your
note
i
hasten
to
say
that
properly
davis
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
our
failure
to
pursue
mcdowell
from
the
field
of
manassas
the
night
of
the
of
july
as
to
the
order
to
which
i
presume
davis
refers
in
his
note
to
you
i
recollect
the
incident
very
distinctly
the
night
of
the
battle
as
i
was
about
to
ascend
to
your
quarters
over
my
office
captain
alexander
of
your
staff
informed
me
that
captain
attached
to
general
army
of
the
shenandoah
reported
that
he
had
been
as
far
forward
as
centreville
where
he
had
seen
the
federal
army
completely
routed
and
in
full
flight
toward
washington
this
statement
i
at
once
repeated
to
davis
general
johnston
and
yourself
whom
i
found
seated
around
your
table
davis
at
the
moment
writing
a
dispatch
to
general
cooper
as
soon
as
i
had
made
my
report
davis
with
much
animation
asserted
the
necessity
for
an
urgent
pursuit
that
night
by
bonham
who
with
his
own
brigade
and
that
of
longstreet
was
in
close
proximity
to
centreville
at
the
moment
so
i
took
my
seat
at
the
same
table
with
you
and
wrote
the
order
for
pursuit
substantially
at
the
dictation
of
davis
but
while
writing
either
i
happened
to
remember
or
captain
alexander
himself
as
i
am
inclined
to
believe
called
me
aside
to
remind
me
that
his
informant
was
known
among
us
of
the
old
army
as
because
of
eccentricities
and
in
contradistinction
with
others
of
the
same
name
when
i
repeated
this
reminder
davis
recalled
the
as
he
had
a
precise
personal
knowledge
of
the
officers
of
the
old
army
he
laughed
heartily
as
did
all
present
the
question
of
throwing
general
bonham
forward
that
night
upon
the
unverified
report
of
captain
was
now
briefly
discussed
with
a
unanimous
decision
against
it
therefore
the
order
was
not
dispatched
it
is
proper
to
add
in
this
connection
that
so
far
as
i
am
aware
and
i
had
the
opportunity
of
knowing
what
occurred
this
was
the
only
instance
during
davis
stay
at
manassas
in
which
he
exercised
any
voice
as
to
the
movement
of
the
troops
profoundly
pleased
with
the
results
achieved
by
the
happy
juncture
of
the
two
confederate
armies
upon
the
very
field
of
battle
his
bearing
toward
the
generals
who
commanded
them
was
eminently
proper
as
i
have
testified
on
a
former
occasion
and
i
repeat
he
certainly
expressed
or
manifested
no
opposition
to
a
forward
movement
nor
did
he
display
the
least
disposition
to
interfere
by
opinion
or
authority
touching
what
the
confederate
forces
should
or
should
not
do
you
having
at
the
close
of
the
day
surrendered
the
command
which
had
been
left
in
your
hands
over
both
confederate
armies
during
the
engagement
general
johnston
was
that
night
in
chief
command
he
was
decidedly
averse
to
an
immediate
offensive
and
emphatically
discountenanced
it
as
impracticable
very
truly

friend

orleans
general
beauregard
in
his
letter
forwarding
the
above
wrote
the
account
given
herewith
by
general
jordan
of
what
occurred
there
respecting
further
pursuit
that
night
agrees
with
my
own
recollection
it
was
a
matter
of
importance
as
i
regarded
it
to
follow
closely
on
the
retreating
enemy
but
it
was
of
no
consequence
then
or
now
as
to
who
issued
the
order
for
pursuit
and
unless
requested
i
should
not
have
dictated
one
preferring
that
the
generals
to
whom
the
operations
were
confided
should
issue
all
orders
to
the
troops
i
supposed
the
order
as
modified
by
myself
had
been
sent
i
have
found
however
since
the
close
of
the
war
that
it
was
not
but
that
an
order
to
the
same
effect
was
sent
on
the
night
of
the
of
july
for
a
copy
of
which
i
am
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
that
chivalrous
gentleman
soldier
and
patriot
general
bonham
it
is
as
follows
headquarters
army
of
the
potomac
manassas
special
orders
no
i
general
bonham
will
send
as
early
as
practicable
in
the
morning
a
command
of
two
of
his
regiments
of
infantry
a
strong
force
of
cavalry
and
one
to
scour
the
country
and
roads
to
his
front
toward
centreville
he
will
carry
with
him
abundant
means
of
transportation
for
the
collection
of
our
wounded
all
the
arms
ammunition
and
abandoned
hospital
stores
subsistence
and
baggage
which
will
be
sent
immediately
to
these
headquarters
general
bonham
will
advance
with
caution
throwing
out
an
advanced
guard
and
skirmishers
on
his
right
and
left
and
the
utmost
caution
must
be
taken
to
prevent
firing
into
our
own
men
should
it
appear
while
this
command
is
occupied
as
directed
that
it
is
insufficient
for
the
purposes
indicated
general
bonham
will
call
on
the
nearest
brigade
commander
for
support
ii
colonel
george
cocke
commanding
will
dispatch
at
the
same
time
for
similar
purposes
a
command
of
the
same
size
and
proportions
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
on
the
road
stone
bridge
and
another
command
of
two
companies
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
on
the
road
by
which
the
enemy
retreated
toward
and
sudley
mills
by
command
of
beauregard
signed
thomas
jordan
to
bonham
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
enemy
was
very
superior
to
us
both
in
numbers
and
appointments
i
had
felt
apprehensive
that
unless
pressed
he
would
recover
from
the
panic
under
which
he
fled
from
the
field
rally
on
his
reserves
and
renew
the
contest
therefore
it
was
that
i
immediately
felt
the
necessity
for
a
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
and
insisted
that
the
troops
on
the
extreme
left
should
retain
their
position
during
the
night
of
the
as
has
been
heretofore
stated
in
conference
with
the
generals
that
night
this
subject
was
considered
and
i
dictated
an
order
for
a
movement
on
the
rear
of
the
enemy
at
early
dawn
which
on
account
of
the
late
hour
at
which
it
was
given
differed
very
little
from
one
for
an
immediate
movement
a
rainfall
extraordinary
for
its
violence
and
duration
occurred
on
the
morning
of
the
succeeding
day
so
that
over
places
where
during
the
battle
one
could
scarcely
get
a
drink
of
water
rolled
torrents
which
in
the
afternoon
of
the
it
was
difficult
to
cross
from
these
and
other
causes
the
troops
were
scattered
to
such
an
extent
that
but
few
commands
could
have
been
assembled
for
immediate
service
it
was
well
for
us
that
the
enemy
instead
of
retiring
in
order
so
as
to
be
rallied
and
again
brought
to
the
attack
left
hope
behind
and
fled
in
dismay
to
seek
for
safety
beyond
the
potomac
each
hour
of
the
day
following
the
battle
added
to
the
evidence
of
a
thorough
rout
of
the
enemy
abandoned
wagons
stores
guns
caissons
and
ammunition
proved
his
complete
demoralization
as
far
as
our
cavalry
went
no
hostile
force
was
met
and
all
the
indications
favored
the
conclusion
that
the
purpose
of
invasion
had
for
the
time
been
abandoned
the
victory
though
decisive
and
important
both
in
its
moral
and
physical
effect
had
been
dearly
bought
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
lives
of
many
of
our
bravest
and
best
who
at
the
first
call
of
their
country
had
rushed
to
its
defense
when
riding
to
the
front
i
met
an
ambulance
bearing
general
barnard
bee
from
the
field
where
he
had
been
mortally
wounded
after
his
patriotism
had
been
illustrated
by
conspicuous
exhibitions
of
skill
daring
and
fortitude
soon
after
i
learned
that
my
friend
colonel
bartow
had
heroically
sealed
with
his
his
faith
in
the
sanctity
of
our
cause
he
had
been
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
military
affairs
in
the
provisional
congress
and
after
the
laws
were
enacted
to
provide
for
the
public
defense
he
went
to
the
field
to
maintain
them
it
is
to
such
virtuous
and
devoted
citizens
that
a
country
is
indebted
for
its
prosperity
and
honor
as
well
in
peace
as
in
war
reference
has
been
made
to
the
dispersion
of
our
troops
after
the
battle
and
in
this
connection
the
following
facts
are
mentioned
in
the
afternoon
of
the
with
a
guide
supposed
to
be
cognizant
of
the
positions
at
which
the
different
commands
would
be
found
i
went
to
visit
the
wounded
and
among
them
a
youth
of
my
family
who
it
was
reported
to
me
was
rapidly
sinking
after
driving
many
miles
and
witnessing
very
painful
scenes
but
seldom
finding
the
troops
in
the
position
where
my
guide
supposed
them
to
be
and
always
disappointed
in
not
discovering
him
i
particularly
sought
i
was
at
the
approach
of
night
about
to
abandon
the
search
when
accidentally
meeting
an
officer
of
the
command
to
which
the
youth
belonged
i
was
directed
to
the
temporary
hospital
to
which
the
wounded
of
that
command
had
been
removed
it
was
too
late
the
soul
of
the
young
soldier
had
just
left
his
body
the
corpse
lay
before
me
around
him
were
many
gentle
boys
suffering
in
different
degrees
from
the
wounds
they
had
received
one
bright
youth
from
south
carolina
severely
if
not
fatally
wounded
responded
to
my
expression
of
sympathy
by
the
heroic
declaration
that
it
was
sweet
to
die
for
such
a
cause
many
kindred
spirits
ascended
to
the
father
from
that
field
of
their
glory
the
roll
need
not
be
recorded
here
it
has
a
more
enduring
depository
than
the
pen
can
make
the
traditions
of
a
grateful
people
the
victory
at
manassas
was
certainly
extraordinary
not
only
on
account
of
the
disparity
of
numbers
and
the
inferiority
of
our
arms
but
also
because
of
many
other
disadvantages
under
which
we
labored
we
had
no
disciplined
troops
and
though
our
citizens
were
generally
skilled
in
the
use
of
which
with
their
high
pride
and
courage
might
compensate
for
the
want
of
training
while
in
position
these
inadequately
substituted
military
instruction
when
manoeuvres
had
to
be
performed
under
fire
and
could
not
make
the
musket
equal
to
the
muskets
with
which
the
enemy
was
supplied
the
disparity
in
artillery
was
still
greater
both
in
the
number
and
kind
of
guns
but
thanks
to
the
skill
and
cool
courage
of
the
rev
captain
pendleton
his
battery
of
light
guns
manned
principally
by
the
youths
whose
rector
he
had
been
proved
more
effective
in
battle
than
the
of
the
enemy
the
character
of
the
ground
brought
the
forces
into
close
contact
and
the
ricochet
of
the
round
balls
carried
havoc
into
the
columns
of
the
enemy
while
the
bolts
of
their
if
they
missed
their
object
penetrated
harmlessly
into
the
ground
the
field
was
very
extensive
broken
and
wooded
the
senior
general
had
so
recently
arrived
that
he
had
no
opportunity
minutely
to
learn
the
ground
and
the
troops
he
brought
were
both
unacquainted
with
the
field
and
with
those
with
whom
they
had
to
coöperate
to
all
this
must
be
added
the
disturbing
fact
that
the
plan
of
battle
as
originally
designed
was
entirely
changed
by
the
movement
of
the
enemy
on
our
extreme
left
instead
of
right
and
center
as
anticipated
the
operations
therefore
had
to
be
conducted
against
the
plan
of
the
enemy
instead
of
on
that
which
our
generals
had
prepared
and
explained
to
their
subordinate
commanders
the
promptitude
with
which
the
troops
moved
and
the
readiness
with
which
our
generals
modified
their
preconceived
plans
to
meet
the
necessities
as
they
were
developed
entitled
them
to
the
commendation
so
liberally
bestowed
at
the
time
by
their
countrymen
at
large
general
johnston
had
been
previously
promoted
to
the
highest
grade
in
our
army
and
i
deemed
it
but
a
fitting
reward
for
the
services
rendered
by
general
beauregard
that
he
should
be
promoted
to
the
same
grade
therefore
i
addressed
to
him
the
following
letter
manassas
virginia
sir
appreciating
your
services
in
the
battle
of
manassas
and
on
several
other
occasions
during
the
existing
war
as
affording
the
highest
evidence
of
your
skill
as
a
commander
your
gallantry
as
a
soldier
and
your
zeal
as
a
patriot
you
are
promoted
to
be
a
general
in
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
and
with
the
consent
of
the
congress
will
be
duly
commissioned
accordingly
yours
signed
jefferson
davis
general
beauregard
etc
the
the
day
after
the
battle
was
spent
in
following
up
the
line
of
the
retreating
foe
and
collecting
the
large
supplies
of
arms
of
ammunition
and
other
military
stores
the
supplies
of
the
army
were
on
a
scale
of
such
luxurious
extravagance
as
to
excite
the
surprise
of
those
accustomed
only
to
our
rigid
economy
the
anticipation
of
an
easy
victory
had
caused
many
to
come
to
the
battle
as
to
a
joyous
feast
and
the
signs
left
behind
them
of
the
extent
to
which
they
had
been
disappointed
in
the
entertainment
constituted
the
staple
of
many
laughable
stories
which
were
not
without
their
value
because
of
the
lesson
they
contained
as
to
the
uncertainties
of
war
and
the
mortification
that
usually
follows
vain
boasting
among
the
articles
abandoned
by
the
enemy
in
his
flight
were
some
which
excited
a
just
indignation
and
which
indicated
the
shameless
disregard
of
all
the
usages
of
honorable
warfare
they
were
handcuffs
the
fit
appendage
of
a
policeman
but
not
of
a
soldier
who
came
to
meet
his
foeman
hilt
to
hilt
these
were
reported
to
have
been
found
in
large
numbers
some
of
them
were
sent
to
richmond
on
the
night
of
the
i
held
a
second
conference
with
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
all
the
revelations
of
the
day
were
of
the
most
satisfactory
character
as
to
the
completeness
of
our
victory
the
large
amount
gained
of
fine
artillery
and
ammunition
all
of
which
were
much
needed
by
us
was
not
the
least
gratifying
consequence
of
our
success
the
generals
like
myself
were
well
content
with
what
had
been
done
i
propounded
to
them
the
inquiry
as
to
what
more
it
was
practicable
to
do
they
concurred
as
to
their
inability
to
cross
the
potomac
and
to
the
further
inquiry
as
to
an
advance
to
the
south
side
of
the
potomac
general
beauregard
promptly
stated
that
there
were
strong
fortifications
there
occupied
by
garrisons
which
had
not
been
in
the
battle
and
were
therefore
not
affected
by
the
panic
which
had
seized
the
defeated
army
he
described
those
fortifications
as
having
wide
deep
ditches
with
palisades
which
would
prevent
the
escalade
of
the
works
turning
to
general
johnston
he
said
they
have
spared
no
expense
it
was
further
stated
in
explanation
that
we
had
no
sappers
and
miners
nor
even
the
tools
requisite
to
make
regular
approaches
if
we
had
possessed
both
the
time
required
for
such
operations
would
have
more
than
sufficed
for
general
patterson
army
and
other
forces
to
have
been
brought
to
that
locality
in
such
numbers
as
must
have
rendered
the
attempt
with
our
present
means
futile
this
view
of
the
matter
rests
on
the
supposition
that
the
fortifications
and
garrisons
described
did
actually
exist
of
which
there
seemed
then
to
be
no
doubt
if
the
reports
which
have
since
reached
us
be
true
that
there
were
at
that
time
neither
fortifications
nor
troops
stationed
on
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
that
all
the
enemy
forces
fled
to
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
even
beyond
that
the
panic
of
the
routed
army
infected
the
whole
population
of
washington
city
and
that
no
preparation
was
made
or
even
contemplated
for
the
destruction
of
the
bridge
across
the
potomac
then
it
may
have
been
as
many
have
asserted
that
our
army
following
close
upon
the
flying
enemy
could
have
entered
and
taken
possession
of
the
united
states
capital
these
reports
however
present
a
condition
of
affairs
altogether
at
variance
with
the
information
on
which
we
had
to
act
thus
it
was
and
so
far
as
i
knew
for
the
reasons
above
stated
that
an
advance
to
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
was
not
contemplated
as
the
immediate
sequence
of
the
victory
at
manassas
what
discoveries
would
have
been
made
and
what
results
would
have
ensued
from
the
establishment
of
our
guns
upon
the
south
bank
of
the
river
to
open
fire
upon
the
capital
are
speculative
questions
upon
which
it
would
be
useless
to
enter
after
the
conference
of
the
and
because
of
it
i
decided
to
return
to
richmond
and
employ
all
the
power
of
my
office
to
increase
the
strength
of
the
army
so
as
the
better
to
enable
it
to
meet
the
public
need
whether
in
or
purely
defensive
operations
as
opportunity
should
offer
for
the
one
or
the
renewal
of
invasion
require
the
other
a
short
time
subsequent
to
my
return
a
message
was
brought
to
me
from
the
prison
to
the
effect
that
a
officer
captured
at
manassas
claimed
to
have
a
promise
of
protection
from
me
the
name
was
given
hulburt
of
connecticut
i
had
forgotten
the
name
he
gave
when
i
saw
him
but
believing
that
i
would
recognize
the
person
who
had
attended
to
colonel
gardner
and
to
whom
only
such
a
promise
had
been
given
the
officer
in
charge
was
directed
to
send
him
to
me
when
he
came
i
had
no
doubt
of
his
identity
and
explained
to
him
that
i
had
directed
that
he
should
not
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
but
that
in
the
multitude
of
those
wearing
the
same
uniform
as
his
some
neglect
or
mistake
had
arisen
for
which
i
was
very
sorry
and
that
he
should
be
immediately
released
and
sent
down
the
river
to
the
neighborhood
of
fortress
monroe
where
he
would
be
among
his
own
people
he
then
told
me
that
he
had
a
sister
residing
a
few
miles
in
the
country
whom
he
would
be
very
glad
to
visit
permission
was
given
him
to
do
so
and
a
time
fixed
at
which
he
was
to
report
for
transportation
and
so
he
left
with
manifestations
of
thankfulness
for
the
kindness
with
which
he
had
been
treated
in
due
time
a
newspaper
was
received
containing
an
account
of
his
escape
and
how
he
had
lingered
about
the
suburbs
of
richmond
and
made
drawings
of
the
surrounding
fortifications
the
treachery
was
as
great
as
if
his
drawings
had
been
valuable
which
they
could
not
have
been
as
we
had
only
then
commenced
the
detached
works
which
were
designed
as
a
system
of
defenses
for
richmond
when
the
smoke
of
battle
had
lifted
from
the
field
of
manassas
and
the
rejoicing
over
the
victory
had
spread
over
the
land
and
spent
its
exuberance
some
who
like
job
snuffed
the
battle
from
afar
but
in
whom
the
likeness
there
ceased
censoriously
asked
why
the
fruits
of
the
victory
had
not
been
gathered
by
the
capture
of
washington
city
then
some
indiscreet
friends
of
the
generals
commanding
in
that
battle
instead
of
the
easier
task
of
justification
chose
the
harder
one
of
exculpation
for
the
imputed
failure
their
zeal
combined
perhaps
with
malice
against
me
induced
the
allegation
that
the
president
had
prevented
the
generals
from
making
an
immediate
and
vigorous
pursuit
of
the
routed
enemy
this
as
other
stories
had
been
was
left
to
the
correction
which
time
it
was
hoped
would
bring
the
sooner
because
it
was
expected
to
be
refuted
by
the
reports
of
the
commanding
generals
with
whom
i
had
conferred
on
that
subject
immediately
after
the
battle
after
considerable
time
had
elapsed
it
was
reported
to
me
that
a
member
of
congress
who
had
served
on
that
occasion
as
a
volunteer
aide
to
general
beauregard
had
stated
in
the
house
of
representatives
that
i
had
prevented
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
after
his
defeat
at
manassas
this
gave
to
the
rumor
such
official
character
and
dignity
as
seemed
to
me
to
entitle
it
to
notice
not
theretofore
given
wherefore
i
addressed
to
general
johnston
the
following
inquiry
which
though
restricted
in
its
terms
to
the
allegation
was
of
such
tenor
as
left
it
to
his
option
to
state
all
the
facts
connected
with
the
slander
if
he
should
choose
to
do
me
that
justice
or
should
see
the
public
interest
involved
in
the
correction
which
as
stated
in
my
letter
to
him
was
that
which
gave
it
in
my
estimation
its
claim
to
consideration
and
had
caused
me
to
address
him
on
the
subject
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
department
of
the
sir
reports
have
been
and
are
being
widely
circulated
to
the
effect
that
i
prevented
general
beauregard
from
pursuing
the
enemy
after
the
battle
of
manassas
and
had
subsequently
restrained
him
from
advancing
upon
washington
city
though
such
statements
may
have
been
made
merely
for
my
injury
and
in
that
view
might
be
postponed
to
a
more
convenient
season
they
have
acquired
importance
from
the
fact
that
they
have
served
to
create
distrust
to
excite
disappointment
and
must
embarrass
the
administration
in
its
further
efforts
to
reënforce
the
armies
of
the
potomac
and
generally
to
provide
for
the
public
defense
for
these
public
considerations
i
call
upon
you
as
the
commanding
general
and
as
a
party
to
all
the
conferences
held
by
me
on
the
and
of
july
to
say
whether
i
obstructed
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
after
the
victory
at
manassas
or
have
ever
objected
to
an
advance
or
other
active
operation
which
it
was
feasible
for
the
army
to
undertake
very
respectfully
yours
signed
jefferson
davis
headquarters
centreville
to
his
excellency
the
president
sir
i
have
had
the
honor
to
receive
your
letter
of
the
in
which
you
call
upon
me
the
commanding
general
and
as
a
party
to
all
the
conferences
held
by
you
on
the
and
of
july
to
say
whether
you
obstructed
the
pursuit
after
the
victory
of
manassas
or
have
ever
objected
to
an
advance
or
other
active
operation
which
it
was
feasible
for
the
army
to
undertake
to
the
first
question
i
reply
no
the
pursuit
was
by
the
enemy
troops
at
centreville
as
i
have
stated
in
my
official
report
in
that
report
i
have
also
said
why
no
advance
was
made
upon
the
enemy
capital
for
reasons
as
follows
the
apparent
freshness
of
the
united
states
troops
at
centreville
which
checked
our
pursuit
the
strong
forces
occupying
the
works
near
georgetown
arlington
and
alexandria
the
certainty
too
that
general
patterson
if
needed
would
reach
washington
with
his
army
of
more
than
thirty
thousand
sooner
than
we
could
and
the
condition
and
inadequate
means
of
the
army
in
ammunition
provisions
and
transportation
prevented
any
serious
thoughts
of
advancing
against
the
capital
to
the
second
question
i
reply
that
it
has
never
been
feasible
for
the
army
to
advance
farther
than
it
has
done
to
the
line
of
fairfax
with
its
advanced
posts
at
upton
munson
and
mason
hills
after
a
conference
at
fairfax
with
the
three
senior
general
officers
you
announced
it
to
be
impracticable
to
give
this
army
the
strength
which
those
officers
considered
necessary
to
enable
it
to
assume
the
offensive
upon
which
i
drew
it
back
to
its
present
position
most
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
signed
e
johnston
this
answer
to
my
inquiry
was
conclusive
as
to
the
charge
which
had
been
industriously
circulated
that
i
had
prevented
the
immediate
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
had
obstructed
active
operations
after
the
battle
of
manassas
and
thus
had
caused
the
failure
to
reap
the
proper
fruits
of
the
victory
no
specific
inquiry
was
made
by
me
as
to
the
part
i
took
in
the
conferences
of
the
and
of
july
but
a
general
reference
was
made
to
them
the
entire
silence
of
general
johnston
in
regard
to
those
conferences
is
noticeable
from
the
fact
that
while
his
answer
was
strictly
measured
by
the
terms
of
my
inquiry
as
to
pursuit
he
added
a
statement
about
a
conference
at
fairfax
which
occurred
in
the
autumn
say
october
and
could
have
had
no
relation
to
the
question
of
pursuit
of
the
enemy
after
the
victory
of
manassas
or
other
active
operations
therewith
connected
the
reasons
stated
in
my
letter
for
making
an
inquiry
naturally
pointed
to
the
conferences
of
the
and
of
july
but
surely
not
to
a
conference
held
months
subsequent
to
the
battle
and
on
a
question
quite
different
from
that
of
hot
pursuit
in
regard
to
the
matter
of
this
subsequent
conference
i
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
i
left
the
field
of
manassas
proud
of
the
heroism
of
our
troops
in
battle
and
of
the
conduct
of
the
officers
who
led
them
anxious
to
recognize
the
claim
of
the
army
on
the
gratitude
of
the
country
it
was
my
pleasing
duty
to
bear
testimony
to
their
merit
in
every
available
form
those
who
left
the
field
and
did
not
return
to
share
its
glory
it
was
wished
should
only
be
remembered
as
exceptions
proving
a
rule
with
all
the
information
possessed
at
the
time
by
the
commanding
generals
the
propriety
of
maintaining
our
position
while
seeking
objects
more
easily
attained
than
the
capture
of
the
united
states
capital
seemed
to
me
so
demonstrable
as
to
require
no
other
justification
than
the
statements
to
which
i
have
referred
in
connection
with
the
conference
of
the
of
july
it
would
have
seemed
to
me
then
as
it
does
now
to
be
less
than
was
due
to
the
energy
and
fortitude
of
our
troops
to
plead
a
want
of
transportation
and
supplies
for
a
march
of
about
twenty
miles
through
a
country
which
had
not
then
been
denuded
by
the
ravages
of
war
under
these
impressions
and
with
such
feelings
i
wrote
to
general
beauregard
as
follows
richmond
virginia
general
beauregard
my
dear
sir
i
think
you
are
unjust
to
yourself
in
putting
your
failure
to
pursue
the
enemy
to
washington
to
the
account
of
short
supplies
of
subsistence
and
transportation
under
the
circumstances
of
our
army
and
in
the
absence
of
the
knowledge
since
acquired
if
indeed
the
statements
be
true
it
would
have
been
extremely
hazardous
to
have
done
more
than
was
performed
you
will
not
fail
to
remember
that
so
far
from
knowing
that
the
enemy
was
routed
a
large
part
of
our
forces
was
moved
by
you
in
the
night
of
the
to
repel
a
supposed
attack
upon
our
right
and
that
the
next
day
operations
did
not
fully
reveal
what
has
since
been
reported
of
the
enemy
panic
enough
was
done
for
glory
and
the
measure
of
duty
was
full
let
us
rather
show
the
untaught
that
their
desires
are
unreasonable
than
by
dwelling
on
possibilities
recently
developed
give
form
and
substance
to
the
criticisms
always
easy
to
those
who
judge
after
the
event
with
sincere
esteem
i
am
your
friend
signed
jefferson
davis
i
had
declared
myself
content
and
gratified
with
the
conduct
of
the
troops
and
the
officers
and
supposed
the
generals
in
recognition
of
my
efforts
to
aid
them
by
increasing
their
force
and
munitions
as
well
as
by
my
abstinence
from
all
interference
with
them
upon
the
field
would
have
neither
cause
nor
motive
to
reflect
upon
me
in
their
reports
and
it
was
with
equal
surprise
and
regret
that
in
this
i
found
myself
mistaken
general
johnston
in
his
report
represented
the
order
to
him
to
make
a
junction
with
general
beauregard
as
a
movement
left
to
his
discretion
with
the
condition
that
if
made
he
should
first
send
his
sick
and
baggage
to
culpepper
i
felt
constrained
to
put
upon
his
report
when
it
was
received
the
following
endorsement
the
telegram
referred
to
by
general
johnston
in
this
report
as
received
by
him
about
one
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
is
inaccurately
reported
the
following

a
copy

attacked
to
strike
the
enemy
a
decisive
blow
a
junction
of
all
your
effective
force

be
needed
if
practicable
make
the

sending
your
sick
and
baggage
to
culpepper
either
by
railroad
or
by
warrenton

all
the
arrangements
exercise
your

cooper
and
the
word
is
not
found
in
the
dispatch
before
the
words
your
sick
as
is
stated
in
the
report
so
that
the
argument
based
on
it
requires
no
comment
the
order
to
move
practicable
had
reference
to
general
johnston
letters
of
the
and
of
july
representing
the
relative
strength
and
positions
of
the
enemy
under
patterson
and
of
his
own
forces
to
be
such
as
to
make
it
doubtful
whether
general
johnston
had
the
power
to
effect
the
movement
upon
the
receipt
of
general
beauregard
report
of
the
battle
of
manassas
i
found
that
it
contained
matter
which
seemed
to
me
out
of
place
and
therefore
addressed
to
him
the
following
letter
richmond
virginia
general
beauregard
sir
yesterday
my
attention
was
called
to
various
newspaper
publications
purporting
to
have
been
sent
from
manassas
and
to
be
a
synopsis
of
your
report
of
the
battle
of
the
of
july
last
and
in
which
it
is
represented
that
you
have
been
overruled
by
me
in
your
plan
for
a
battle
with
the
enemy
south
of
the
potomac
for
the
capture
of
baltimore
and
washington
and
the
liberation
of
maryland
i
inquired
for
your
report
and
it
has
been
submitted
to
my
inspection
it
appears
by
official
endorsement
to
have
been
received
by
the
on
the
of
october
though
it
is
dated
august
with
much
surprise
i
found
that
the
newspaper
statements
were
sustained
by
the
text
of
your
report
i
was
surprised
because
if
we
did
differ
in
opinion
as
to
the
measure
and
purposes
of
contemplated
campaigns
such
fact
could
have
no
appropriate
place
in
the
report
of
a
battle
further
because
it
seemed
to
be
an
attempt
to
exalt
yourself
at
my
expense
and
especially
because
no
such
plan
as
that
described
was
submitted
to
me
it
is
true
that
some
time
before
it
was
ordered
you
expressed
a
desire
for
the
junction
of
general
johnston
army
with
your
own
the
movement
was
postponed
until
the
operations
of
the
enemy
rendered
it
necessary
and
until
it
became
thereby
practicable
to
make
it
with
safety
to
the
valley
of
virginia
hence
i
believe
was
secured
the
success
by
which
it
was
attended
if
you
have
retained
a
copy
of
the
plan
of
campaign
which
you
say
was
submitted
to
me
through
colonel
chesnut
allow
me
to
request
that
you
will
furnish
me
with
a
duplicate
of
it
very
respectfully
yours
signed
jefferson
davis
as
general
beauregard
did
not
think
proper
to
omit
that
portion
of
his
report
to
which
objection
was
made
it
necessitated
when
the
entire
report
was
transmitted
to
congress
the
placing
of
an
endorsement
upon
it
reviewing
that
part
of
the
report
which
i
considered
objectionable
the
congress
in
its
discretion
ordered
the
publication
of
the
report
except
that
part
to
which
the
endorsement
referred
thereby
judiciously
suppressing
both
the
endorsement
and
the
portion
of
the
report
to
which
it
related
in
this
case
and
official
report
ever
submitted
to
me
i
made
neither
alteration
nor
erasure
that
portion
of
the
report
which
was
suppressed
by
the
congress
has
since
the
war
found
its
way
into
the
press
but
the
endorsement
which
belonged
to
it
has
not
been
published
as
part
of
the
history
of
the
time
i
will
here
present
both
in
their
proper
connection
general
cooper
and
richmond
before
entering
upon
a
narration
of
the
general
military
operations
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
on
july
i
propose
i
hope
not
unreasonably
first
to
recite
certain
events
which
belong
to
the
strategy
of
the
campaign
and
consequently
form
an
essential
part
of
the
history
of
the
battle
having
become
satisfied
that
the
advance
of
the
enemy
with
a
decidedly
superior
force
both
as
to
numbers
and
war
equipage
to
attack
or
turn
my
position
in
this
quarter
was
immediately
impending
i
dispatched
on
july
one
of
my
staff
colonel
james
chesnut
of
south
carolina
to
submit
for
the
consideration
of
the
president
a
plan
of
operations
substantially
as
follows
i
proposed
that
general
johnston
should
unite
as
soon
as
possible
the
bulk
of
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
with
that
of
the
potomac
then
under
my
command
leaving
only
sufficient
force
to
garrison
his
strong
works
at
winchester
and
to
guard
the
five
defensive
passes
of
the
blue
ridge
and
thus
hold
patterson
in
check
at
the
same
time
holmes
was
to
march
hither
with
all
of
his
command
not
essential
for
the
defense
of
the
position
of
acquia
creek
these
junctions
having
been
effected
at
manassas
an
immediate
impetuous
attack
of
our
combined
armies
upon
general
mcdowell
was
to
follow
as
soon
as
he
approached
my
advanced
position
at
and
around
fairfax
with
the
inevitable
result
as
i
submitted
of
his
complete
defeat
and
the
destruction
or
capture
of
his
army
this
accomplished
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
under
general
johnston
increased
with
a
part
of
my
forces
and
rejoined
as
he
returned
by
the
detachment
left
to
hold
the
was
to
march
back
rapidly
into
the
valley
fall
upon
and
crush
patterson
with
a
superior
force
wheresoever
he
might
be
found
this
i
confidently
estimated
could
be
achieved
within
fifteen
days
after
general
johnston
should
march
from
winchester
for
manassas
meanwhile
i
was
to
occupy
the
enemy
works
on
this
side
of
the
potomac
if
as
i
anticipated
he
had
been
so
routed
as
to
enable
me
to
enter
them
with
him
or
if
not
to
retire
again
for
a
time
within
the
lines
of
bull
run
with
my
main
force
patterson
having
been
virtually
destroyed
then
general
johnston
would
reënforce
general
garnett
sufficiently
to
make
him
superior
to
his
opponent
general
mcclellan
and
able
to
defeat
that
officer
this
done
general
garnett
was
to
form
an
immediate
junction
with
general
johnston
who
was
forthwith
to
cross
the
potomac
into
maryland
with
his
whole
force
arouse
the
people
as
he
advanced
to
the
recovery
of
their
political
rights
and
the
defense
of
their
homes
and
families
from
an
offensive
invader
and
then
march
to
the
investment
of
washington
in
the
rear
while
i
resumed
the
offensive
in
front
this
plan
of
operations
you
are
aware
was
not
acceptable
at
the
time
from
considerations
which
appeared
so
weighty
as
to
more
than
counterbalance
its
proposed
advantages
informed
of
these
views
and
of
the
decision
of
the
war
department
i
then
made
my
preparations
for
the
stoutest
practicable
defense
of
the
line
of
bull
run
the
enemy
having
developed
his
purpose
by
the
advance
on
and
occupation
of
fairfax
from
which
my
advance
brigade
had
been
withdrawn
the
war
department
having
been
informed
by
me
by
telegraph
on
july
of
the
movement
of
general
mcdowell
general
johnston
was
immediately
ordered
to
form
a
junction
of
his
army
corps
with
mine
should
the
movement
in
his
judgment
be
deemed
advisable
general
holmes
was
also
directed
to
push
forward
with
two
regiments
a
battery
and
one
company
of
cavalry
endorsement
the
order
issued
by
the
war
department
to
general
johnston
was
not
as
herein
reported
to
form
a
junction
the
movement
in
his
judgment
be
deemed
advisable
the
following
is
an
accurate
copy
of
the
order
beauregard
is
attacked
to
strike
the
enemy
a
decisive
blow
a
junction
of
all
your
effective
force
will
be
needed
if
practicable
make
the
movement
sending
your
sick
and
baggage
to
culpepper
either
by
railroad
or
by
warrenton
in
all
the
arrangements
exercise
your
discretion
the
words
practicable
had
reference
to
letters
of
general
johnston
of
the
and
of
july
which
made
it
extremely
doubtful
if
he
had
the
power
to
make
the
movement
in
view
of
the
relative
strength
and
position
of
patterson
forces
as
compared
with
his
own
the
plan
of
campaign
reported
to
have
been
submitted
but
not
accepted
and
to
have
led
to
a
decision
of
the
war
department
can
not
be
found
among
its
files
nor
any
reference
to
any
decision
made
upon
it
and
it
was
not
known
that
the
army
had
advanced
beyond
the
line
of
bull
run
the
position
previously
selected
by
general
lee
and
which
was
supposed
to
have
continued
to
be
the
defensive
line
occupied
by
the
main
body
of
our
forces
inquiry
has
developed
the
fact
that
a
message
to
be
verbally
delivered
was
sent
by
hon
chesnut
if
the
conjectures
recited
in
the
report
were
entertained
they
rested
on
the
accomplishment
of
one
great
condition
namely
that
a
junction
of
the
forces
of
generals
johnston
and
holmes
should
be
made
with
the
army
of
general
beauregard
and
should
gain
a
victory
the
junction
was
made
the
victory
was
won
but
the
consequences
that
were
predicted
did
not
result
the
reasons
why
no
such
consequences
could
result
are
given
in
the
closing
passages
of
the
reports
of
both
the
commanding
generals
and
the
responsibility
can
not
be
transferred
to
the
government
at
richmond
which
certainly
would
have
united
in
any
feasible
plan
to
accomplish
such
desirable
results
if
the
plan
of
campaign
mentioned
in
the
report
had
been
presented
in
a
written
communication
and
in
sufficient
detail
to
permit
proper
investigation
it
must
have
been
pronounced
to
be
impossible
at
that
time
and
its
proposal
could
only
have
been
accounted
for
by
the
want
of
information
of
the
forces
and
positions
of
the
armies
in
the
field
the
facts
that
rendered
it
impossible
are
the
following
it
was
based
as
related
from
memory
by
colonel
chesnut
on
the
supposition
of
drawing
a
force
of
about
thousand
men
from
the
command
of
general
johnston
the
letters
of
general
johnston
show
his
effective
force
to
have
been
only
eleven
thousand
with
an
enemy
thirty
thousand
strong
in
his
front
ready
to
take
possession
of
the
valley
of
virginia
on
his
withdrawal
it
proposed
to
continue
operations
by
effecting
a
junction
of
a
part
of
the
victorious
forces
with
the
army
of
general
garnett
in
western
virginia
general
garnett
forces
amounted
only
to
three
or
four
thousand
men
then
known
to
be
in
rapid
retreat
before
vastly
superior
forces
under
mcclellan
and
the
news
that
he
was
himself
killed
and
his
army
scattered
arrived
within
hours
of
colonel
chesnut
arrival
in
richmond
the
plan
was
based
on
the
improbable
and
inadmissible
supposition
that
the
enemy
was
to
await
everywhere
isolated
and
motionless
until
our
forces
could
effect
junctions
to
attack
them
in
detail
it
could
not
be
expected
that
any
success
obtainable
on
the
would
enable
our
forces
to
carry
the
fortifications
on
the
potomac
garrisoned
and
within
supporting
distance
of
fresh
troops
nor
after
the
actual
battle
and
victory
did
the
generals
on
the
field
propose
an
advance
on
the
capital
nor
does
it
appear
that
they
have
since
believed
themselves
in
a
condition
to
attempt
such
a
movement
it
is
proper
also
to
observe
that
there
is
no
communication
on
file
in
the
war
department
as
recited
at
the
close
of
the
report
showing
what
were
the
causes
which
prevented
the
advance
of
our
forces
and
prolonged
vigorous
pursuit
of
the
enemy
to
and
beyond
the
potomac
signed
jefferson
davis
it
has
not
been
my
purpose
to
describe
the
battles
of
the
war
to
the
reports
of
the
officers
serving
on
the
field
in
the
armies
of
both
governments
the
student
of
history
must
turn
for
knowledge
of
the
details
and
it
will
be
the
task
of
the
future
historian
from
comparison
of
the
whole
to
deduce
the
truth
it
is
fortunate
for
the
cause
of
justice
that
error
and
misrepresentation
have
in
their
inconsistencies
and
improbabilities
the
elements
of
while
truth
is
in
its
nature
consistent
and
therefore
to
such
general
remarks
in
regard
to
campaigns
sieges
and
battles
as
may
seem
to
me
appropriate
to
the
scope
and
object
of
my
work
i
shall
append
or
insert
from
time
to
time
the
evidence
of
reliable
actors
in
those
affairs
as
well
to
elucidate
obscurity
as
to
correct
error
from
the
official
reports
it
appears
that
the
strength
of
the
two
armies
was
confederate
men
of
all
arms
with
guns
federal
men
with
a
body
of
cavalry
of
which
only
one
company
is
reported
and
a
large
artillery
force
not
shown
in
the
tabular
statement
of
these
troops
some
on
both
sides
were
not
engaged
in
the
battle
this
it
is
believed
was
the
case
to
a
much
larger
extent
on
our
side
than
on
that
of
the
enemy
he
selected
the
point
of
attack
and
could
concentrate
his
troops
for
that
purpose
but
we
were
guarding
a
line
of
some
seven
miles
front
and
therefore
widely
dispersed
for
the
purpose
above
stated
extracts
are
herein
inserted
from
a
narrative
in
the
operations
on
the
line
of
bull
run
in
june
and
july
including
the
first
battle
of
manassas
the
name
of
the
author
j
a
early
will
to
all
who
know
him
be
a
sufficient
guarantee
for
the
accuracy
of
the
statements
and
for
the
justice
of
the
conclusions
announced
to
those
who
do
not
know
him
it
may
be
proper
to
state
that
he
was
educated
as
a
soldier
after
leaving
the
army
became
a
lawyer
but
when
his
country
was
involved
in
war
with
mexico
he
volunteered
and
served
in
a
regiment
of
his
native
state
virginia
after
that
war
terminated
he
returned
to
the
practice
of
his
profession
which
he
was
actively
pursuing
when
the
controversy
between
the
sections
caused
the
call
of
a
convention
to
decide
whether
virginia
should
secede
from
the
union
he
was
sent
by
the
people
of
the
county
in
which
he
resided
to
represent
them
in
that
convention
there
he
opposed
to
the
last
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance
for
secession
but
when
it
was
decided
against
his
opinion
to
resort
to
the
remedy
of
withdrawal
from
the
union
he
true
to
his
allegiance
to
the
state
of
which
he
was
a
citizen
paused
not
to
cavil
or
protest
but
at
once
stepped
forth
to
defend
her
against
a
threatened
invasion
the
sword
that
had
rusted
in
peace
gleamed
brightly
in
war
he
rose
to
the
high
grade
of
none
have
a
more
stainless
record
as
a
soldier
none
have
shown
a
higher
patriotism
or
purer
fidelity
through
all
the
bitter
trials
to
which
we
have
been
subjected
since
open
war
was
ended
and
nominal
peace
began
extracts
from
the
narrative
of
general
j
a
early
of
events
occurring
when
he
was
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
virginia
infantry
and
commanding
a
brigade
on
june
i
arrived
at
manassas
junction
and
reported
to
general
beauregard
the
virginia
regiment
having
been
previously
sent
to
him
under
the
command
of
hairsten
from
lynchburg
where
i
had
been
stationed
under
the
orders
of
general
robert
lee
for
the
purpose
of
organizing
the
virginia
troops
which
were
being
mustered
into
service
at
that
place
on
the
morning
of
july
my
brigade
was
moved
by
order
of
general
beauregard
to
the
left
of
camp
walker
on
the
railroad
and
remained
there
some
time
on
falling
back
general
ewell
in
pursuance
of
his
instructions
had
burned
the
bridges
on
the
railroad
over
run
from
fairfax
station
to
union
mills
and
while
i
was
at
camp
walker
i
saw
the
smoke
ascending
from
the
over
bull
run
which
was
burned
that
morning
the
burning
of
this
bridge
had
not
been
included
in
the
previous
instructions
to
ewell
and
i
have
always
been
at
a
loss
to
know
why
it
was
now
fired
that
bridge
certainly
was
not
necessary
to
the
enemy
for
crossing
bull
run
either
with
his
troops
or
wagons
as
that
stream
was
easily
fordable
at
numerous
places
both
above
and
below
the
bridge
was
moreover
susceptible
of
easy
defense
as
there
were
deep
cuts
leading
to
it
on
both
sides
the
only
possible
purpose
to
be
subserved
by
the
burning
of
that
bridge
would
have
been
the
prevention
for
a
short
time
of
the
running
of
trains
over
it
by
the
enemy
in
the
event
of
our
defeat
or
evacuation
of
manassas
without
a
fight
as
it
was
we
were
afterward
greatly
inconvenienced
by
its
destruction
the
attack
made
on
the
is
described
as
directed
against
our
right
center
and
as
having
been
met
and
repulsed
in
a
manner
quite
creditable
to
our
raw
troops
of
whom
he
writes
on
the
they
were
occupied
in
the
effort
to
strengthen
their
position
by
throwing
up
the
best
defenses
they
could
with
the
implements
at
hand
which
consisted
of
a
very
few
picks
and
spades
some
rough
and
the
bayonets
of
the
muskets
the
position
was
a
very
weak
one
as
the
banks
on
the
opposite
side
of
bull
run
overlooked
and
commanded
those
on
the
south
side
which
were
but
a
few
feet
above
the
edge
and
there
was
an
open
field
in
rear
of
the
strip
of
woods
on
our
side
of
the
stream
for
a
considerable
distance
up
and
down
it
which
exposed
all
of
our
movements
on
that
side
to
observation
from
the
opposite
one
as
the
strip
of
woods
afforded
but
a
thin
veil
which
could
be
seen
through
about
dusk
on
the
brigade
commanders
were
summoned
to
a
conference
at
mclean
house
by
general
beauregard
and
he
then
informed
us
of
the
fact
that
general
johnston
had
been
ordered
at
his
instance
from
the
valley
and
was
marching
to
coöperate
with
us
he
stated
that
johnston
would
march
directly
across
the
blue
ridge
toward
the
enemy
right
flank
and
would
probably
attack
on
that
flank
at
dawn
the
next
morning
before
he
had
finished
his
statement
of
the
plans
he
proposed
pursuing
in
the
event
of
johnston
attack
on
the
enemy
right
flank
a
party
of
horsemen
rode
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
dismounting
one
of
them
walked
in
and
reported
himself
as
jackson
who
had
arrived
with
the
advanced
brigade
of
johnston
troops
by
the
way
of
manassas
gap
railroad
and
he
stated
that
his
brigade
was
about
hundred
strong
this
information
took
general
beauregard
very
much
by
surprise
and
after
ascertaining
that
general
jackson
had
taken
the
cars
at
piedmont
station
general
beauregard
asked
him
if
general
johnston
would
not
march
the
rest
of
his
command
on
the
direct
road
so
as
to
get
on
the
enemy
right
flank
general
jackson
replied
with
some
little
hesitation
and
as
i
thought
at
the
time
in
rather
a
stolid
manner
that
he
thought
not
that
he
thought
the
purpose
was
to
transport
the
whole
force
by
railroad
from
piedmont
station
this
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
general
jackson
and
my
first
impressions
of
him
were
not
very
favorable
from
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
his
information
i
subsequently
ascertained
very
well
how
it
was
that
he
seemed
to
know
so
little
in
the
presence
of
the
strangers
among
whom
he
found
himself
of
general
johnston
intended
movements
and
i
presume
nothing
but
the
fact
of
general
beauregard
being
his
superior
in
rank
and
his
being
ordered
to
report
to
him
could
have
elicited
as
much
information
from
him
under
the
circumstances
as
was
obtained
after
general
jackson
had
given
the
information
above
stated
and
received
instructions
where
to
put
his
brigade
he
retired
and
general
beauregard
proceeded
to
develop
fully
his
plans
for
the
next
day
the
information
received
from
general
jackson
was
wholly
unexpected
but
general
beauregard
said
he
thought
jackson
was
not
correctly
informed
and
was
mistaken
that
he
was
satisfied
general
johnston
was
marching
with
the
rest
of
his
troops
and
would
attack
the
enemy
right
flank
early
next
day
as
he
had
before
stated
upon
this
hypothesis
he
directed
that
when
general
johnston
attack
began
and
he
had
become
fully
engaged
of
which
we
were
to
judge
from
the
character
of
the
we
should
cross
bull
run
from
our
several
positions
and
move
upon
the
enemy
so
as
to
attack
him
on
his
left
flank
and
rear
he
said
that
he
had
no
doubt
general
johnston
attack
would
be
a
complete
surprise
to
the
enemy
that
the
latter
would
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
that
when
he
turned
to
meet
that
attack
and
soon
found
himself
assailed
on
the
other
side
he
would
be
still
more
surprised
and
would
not
know
what
to
do
that
the
effect
would
become
a
complete
rout
a
perfect
waterloo
and
that
when
the
enemy
took
to
flight
we
would
pursue
cross
the
potomac
and
arouse
maryland
during
the
general
johnston
arrived
at
manassas
junction
by
the
railroad
and
that
day
we
received
the
order
from
him
assuming
command
of
the
combined
armies
of
general
beauregard
and
himself
early
on
the
morning
of
the
sunday
we
heard
the
guns
open
from
the
heights
north
of
bull
run
from
which
they
had
opened
on
the
and
i
soon
received
orders
for
the
movement
of
my
brigade
upon
arriving
there
mclean
ford
i
found
general
jones
had
returned
to
the
intrenchments
with
his
brigade
and
i
was
informed
by
him
that
general
beauregard
had
directed
that
i
should
join
him
general
beauregard
with
my
brigade
he
then
asked
me
if
i
had
received
an
order
from
general
beauregard
to
go
to
him
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
he
informed
me
that
he
had
such
an
order
for
me
in
a
note
to
him
he
sent
to
one
of
his
for
the
note
and
showed
it
to
me
the
note
was
one
directing
him
to
fall
back
behind
bull
run
and
was
in
pencil
at
the
foot
of
it
were
these
words
early
to
me
this
was
all
the
order
that
i
received
to
move
to
the
left
and
it
was
shown
to
me
a
very
little
after
twelve
chisholm
who
carried
the
note
to
jones
in
which
was
contained
the
order
i
received
passed
me
at
mclean
ford
going
on
to
jones
about
or
a
little
after
eleven
if
i
had
not
received
the
order
until
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
get
on
the
field
at
the
time
i
reached
it
about
colonel
chisholm
informed
me
that
the
order
was
for
all
the
troops
to
fall
back
across
bull
run
i
was
met
by
colonel
john
preston
one
of
the
general
aides
who
informed
me
that
general
beauregard
had
gone
where
the
fighting
was
but
that
general
johnston
was
just
in
front
and
his
directions
were
that
we
should
proceed
to
the
left
where
there
was
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
when
we
reached
general
johnston
he
expressed
great
gratification
at
our
arrival
but
it
was
very
perceptible
that
his
anticipations
were
not
sanguine
he
gave
me
special
instructions
as
to
my
movements
directing
me
to
clear
our
lines
completely
before
going
to
the
front
in
some
fields
on
the
left
of
our
line
we
found
colonel
stuart
with
a
body
of
cavalry
and
some
pieces
of
artillery
belonging
as
i
understood
to
a
battery
commanded
by
lieutenant
beckham
i
found
stuart
already
in
position
beyond
our
extreme
left
and
as
i
understood
it
supporting
and
controlling
beckham
guns
which
were
firing
on
the
enemy
extreme
right
flank
thus
rendering
very
efficient
service
i
feel
well
assured
that
stuart
had
but
companies
of
cavalry
with
him
as
these
were
all
i
saw
when
he
afterward
went
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
as
i
approached
the
left
a
young
man
named
saunders
came
galloping
to
me
from
stuart
with
the
information
that
the
enemy
was
about
retreating
and
a
request
to
hurry
on
this
was
the
first
word
of
encouragement
we
had
received
since
we
reached
the
vicinity
of
the
battle
i
told
the
messenger
to
inform
stuart
that
i
was
then
moving
as
rapidly
as
my
men
could
move
but
he
soon
returned
with
another
message
informing
me
that
the
other
was
a
mistake
that
the
enemy
had
merely
retired
behind
the
ridge
in
front
to
form
a
new
flanking
column
and
cautioning
me
to
be
on
my
guard
this
last
information
proved
to
be
correct
it
was
the
last
effort
of
the
enemy
to
extend
his
right
beyond
our
left
and
was
met
by
the
formation
of
my
regiments
in
his
front
the
hill
on
which
the
enemy
troops
were
was
chinn
hill
so
often
referred
to
in
the
accounts
of
this
battle
and
the
one
next
year
on
the
same
field
an
officer
came
to
me
in
a
gallop
and
entreated
me
not
to
fire
on
the
troops
in
front
and
i
was
so
much
impressed
by
his
earnest
manner
and
confident
tone
that
i
halted
my
brigade
on
the
side
of
the
hill
and
rode
to
the
top
of
it
when
i
discovered
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
to
my
right
a
regiment
bearing
a
flag
which
was
drooping
around
the
staff
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
be
distinguishable
from
the
confederate
flag
of
that
day
i
thought
that
if
the
one
that
had
been
in
front
of
me
was
a
virginia
regiment
this
must
also
be
a
confederate
one
but
one
or
two
shots
from
beckham
guns
on
the
left
caused
the
regiment
to
face
about
when
its
flag
unfurled
and
i
discovered
it
to
be
the
united
states
flag
i
forthwith
ordered
my
brigade
forward
but
it
did
not
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
soon
enough
to
do
any
damage
to
the
retiring
regiment
which
retreated
precipitately
down
the
hill
and
across
the
warrenton
pike
at
that
time
there
was
very
little
distinction
between
the
dress
of
some
of
the
federal
regiments
and
some
of
ours
as
soon
as
the
misrepresentation
in
regard
to
the
character
of
the
troops
was
corrected
my
brigade
advanced
to
the
top
of
the
hill
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
enemy
and
we
ascertained
that
his
troops
had
retired
precipitately
and
a
large
body
of
them
was
discovered
in
the
fields
in
rear
of
dogan
house
and
north
of
the
turnpike
colonel
cocke
with
one
of
his
regiments
now
joined
us
and
our
pieces
of
artillery
were
advanced
and
fired
upon
the
columns
with
considerable
effect
causing
them
to
disperse
and
we
soon
discovered
that
they
were
in
full
retreat
when
my
column
was
seen
by
general
beauregard
he
at
first
thought
it
was
a
column
of
the
enemy
having
received
erroneous
information
that
such
a
column
was
on
the
manassas
gap
railroad
the
enemy
took
my
troops
as
they
approached
his
right
for
a
large
body
of
our
troops
from
the
valley
and
as
my
men
moving
by
flank
were
stretched
out
at
considerable
length
from
weariness
they
were
greatly
we
scared
the
enemy
worse
than
we
hurt
him
we
saw
the
evidences
of
the
flight
all
along
our
march
and
unmistakable
indications
of
the
overwhelming
character
of
the
enemy
defeat
in
abandoned
muskets
and
equipments
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
the
enemy
farther
as
well
because
i
was
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
crossings
of
the
run
and
the
woods
in
front
as
because
most
of
the
men
belonging
to
my
brigade
had
been
marching
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
were
very
much
exhausted
but
pursuit
with
infantry
would
have
been
unavailing
as
the
enemy
troops
retreated
with
such
rapidity
that
they
could
not
have
been
overtaken
by
any
other
than
mounted
troops
on
the
next
day
we
found
a
great
many
articles
that
the
routed
troops
had
abandoned
in
their
flight
showing
that
no
expense
or
trouble
had
been
spared
by
the
enemy
in
equipping
his
army
in
my
movement
after
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
commenced
i
passed
the
carter
house
and
beyond
our
line
of
battle
the
enemy
had
by
this
time
entirely
disappeared
and
having
no
knowledge
of
the
country
whatever
being
on
the
ground
for
the
first
time
besides
not
observing
any
movement
of
troops
from
our
line
i
halted
with
the
expectation
of
receiving
further
orders
observing
some
men
near
the
carter
house
i
rode
to
it
and
found
some
five
or
six
federal
soldiers
who
had
collected
some
wounded
there
of
both
sides
and
among
them
colonel
gardner
of
the
eighth
georgia
regiment
who
was
suffering
from
a
very
painful
wound
in
the
leg
which
was
fractured
just
above
the
ankle
just
after
my
return
from
the
house
where
i
saw
colonel
gardner
president
davis
in
company
with
several
gentlemen
rode
to
where
my
command
was
and
addressed
a
few
stirring
remarks
to
my
regiments
in
succession
which
received
him
with
great
enthusiasm
i
briefly
informed
davis
of
the
orders
i
had
received
and
the
movements
of
my
brigade
and
asked
him
what
i
should
do
under
the
circumstances
he
told
me
that
i
had
better
get
my
men
into
line
and
wait
for
further
orders
i
then
requested
him
to
inform
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
of
my
position
and
my
desire
to
receive
orders
i
also
informed
him
of
the
condition
in
which
i
had
found
colonel
gardner
and
also
of
colonel
jones
being
in
the
neighborhood
badly
wounded
requesting
him
to
have
a
surgeon
sent
to
their
relief
as
all
of
mine
were
in
the
rear
attending
to
the
wounded
of
their
regiments
while
we
were
talking
we
saw
a
body
of
troops
moving
on
the
opposite
side
of
bull
run
some
distance
below
us
davis
then
left
me
going
to
the
house
where
colonel
gardner
was
and
i
moved
my
brigade
some
half
a
mile
farther
and
formed
it
in
line
across
the
peninsula
formed
by
a
very
considerable
bend
in
bull
run
above
the
stone
bridge
i
put
out
a
line
of
pickets
in
front
and
my
brigade
bivouacked
in
this
position
for
the
night
by
the
time
all
these
dispositions
were
made
it
was
night
and
i
then
rode
back
with
captain
gardner
over
the
route
i
had
moved
on
as
i
knew
no
other
in
order
to
find
general
johnston
or
general
beauregard
so
that
i
might
receive
orders
supposing
that
there
would
be
a
forward
movement
early
in
the
morning
i
first
went
to
the
lewis
house
which
i
found
to
be
a
hospital
filled
with
wounded
men
but
was
unable
to
get
any
information
about
either
of
the
generals
i
then
rode
toward
manassas
and
after
going
some
distance
in
that
direction
i
met
an
officer
who
inquired
for
general
johnston
stating
that
he
was
on
his
staff
i
informed
him
that
i
was
looking
for
general
johnston
also
as
well
as
for
general
beauregard
and
supposed
they
were
at
manassas
but
he
said
that
he
was
just
from
manassas
and
neither
of
the
generals
was
there
at
about
twelve
at
night
i
lay
down
in
the
field
in
rear
of
my
command
on
a
couple
of
bundles
of
wheat
in
the
straw
my
men
had
no
rations
with
them
i
had
picked
up
a
haversack
on
the
field
which
was
filled
with
hard
biscuits
and
had
been
dropped
by
some
yankee
in
his
flight
and
out
of
its
contents
i
made
my
own
supper
distributing
the
rest
among
a
number
of
officers
who
had
nothing
very
early
next
morning
i
sent
captain
gardner
to
look
out
for
the
generals
and
get
orders
for
my
command
he
went
to
manassas
and
found
general
beauregard
who
sent
orders
to
me
to
remain
where
i
was
until
further
orders
and
to
send
for
the
rations
of
my
command
a
number
of
the
men
spread
over
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
the
battlefield
and
picked
up
a
great
many
knapsacks
cloths
blankets
overcoats
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
sugar
coffee
and
other
provisions
that
had
been
abandoned
by
the
enemy
after
i
had
received
orders
showing
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
make
a
forward
movement
i
rode
over
a
good
deal
of
the
field
north
of
the
warrenton
pike
and
to
some
hospitals
in
the
vicinity
in
order
to
see
what
care
was
being
taken
of
the
wounded
i
found
a
hospital
on
the
sudley
road
back
of
the
field
of
battle
at
which
colonel
jones
of
the
fourth
alabama
had
been
which
was
in
charge
of
a
surgeon
of
a
rhode
island
regiment
whose
name
was
harris
i
think
i
asked
him
if
he
had
what
he
wanted
for
the
men
under
his
care
and
he
told
me
he
would
like
to
have
some
morphine
of
which
his
supply
was
short
i
directed
a
young
surgeon
of
our
cavalry
who
rode
up
at
the
time
to
furnish
the
morphine
which
he
did
from
a
pair
of
medical
which
he
had
harris
told
me
that
he
knew
that
their
troops
had
had
a
great
deal
of
coffee
and
sugar
mixed
ready
for
boiling
of
which
a
good
deal
had
been
left
at
different
points
near
the
field
and
asked
if
there
would
be
any
objection
to
his
sending
out
and
gathering
some
of
it
for
the
use
of
the
wounded
under
his
charge
as
it
would
be
of
much
service
to
them
i
gave
him
the
permission
to
get
not
only
that
but
anything
else
that
would
tend
to
the
comfort
of
his
patients
there
did
not
come
within
my
observation
any
instance
of
harsh
or
unkind
treatment
of
the
enemy
wounded
nor
did
i
see
any
indication
of
a
spirit
to
extend
such
treatment
to
them
the
stories
which
were
afterward
told
before
the
committee
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
appointed
by
the
federal
congress
in
regard
to
atrocities
were
very
grossly
exaggerated
or
manufactured
from
the
whole
cloth
on
the
night
following
the
battle
when
i
was
looking
for
generals
beauregard
and
johnston
in
riding
over
and
to
the
rear
of
the
i
discovered
that
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
that
had
been
engaged
in
the
battle
were
in
a
great
state
of
confusion
i
saw
companies
looking
for
their
regiments
and
squads
looking
for
their
companies
and
they
were
scattered
as
far
as
i
went
toward
manassas
it
was
very
apparent
that
no
considerable
body
of
those
troops
that
had
been
engaged
on
the
left
could
have
been
brought
into
a
condition
next
day
for
an
advance
toward
washington
the
dispute
as
to
who
planned
the
battle
or
commanded
on
the
field
general
johnston
or
general
beauregard
is
a
most
unprofitable
one
the
battle
which
general
beauregard
planned
was
never
fought
because
the
enemy
did
not
move
as
he
expected
him
to
move
the
battle
which
was
fought
was
planned
by
mcdowell
at
least
so
far
as
the
ground
on
which
it
was
fought
was
concerned
he
made
a
movement
on
our
left
which
was
wholly
unexpected
and
unprovided
for
and
we
were
compelled
to
fight
a
defensive
battle
on
that
flank
by
bringing
up
reënforcements
from
other
points
as
rapidly
as
possible
when
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
arrived
on
the
field
where
the
battle
was
actually
fought
it
had
been
progressing
for
some
time
with
the
odds
greatly
against
us
what
was
required
then
was
to
rally
the
troops
already
engaged
which
had
been
considerably
shattered
and
hold
the
position
to
which
they
had
been
compelled
to
retire
until
reënforcements
could
be
brought
up
according
to
the
statements
of
both
generals
the
command
of
the
troops
then
on
the
field
was
given
to
general
beauregard
and
he
continued
to
exercise
it
until
the
close
but
in
subordination
of
course
to
general
johnston
as
while
the
movements
of
all
the
reënforcements
as
they
arrived
were
unquestionably
directed
by
the
latter
according
to
the
statement
of
both
the
movement
of
elzey
brigade
to
the
left
averted
a
great
danger
and
both
concur
in
attributing
the
turning
of
the
tide
of
battle
to
the
movement
of
my
brigade
against
the
enemy
extreme
right
flank
general
beauregard
in
a
letter
on
the
origin
of
the
and
general
johnston
in
his
recently
published
general
beauregard
unquestionably
performed
the
duty
assigned
him
with
great
ability
and
general
johnston
gives
him
full
credit
therefor
where
then
is
there
any
room
for
a
controversy
in
regard
to
the
actual
command
and
what
profit
can
there
be
in
it
general
johnston
assumes
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
to
advance
on
washington
and
why
then
should
an
effort
be
made
to
shift
it
on
any
one
else
he
certainly
was
and
had
the
privilege
of
advancing
if
he
thought
proper
the
attempt
to
show
that
the
failure
to
advance
was
due
to
the
want
of
transportation
and
rations
for
the
army
is
idle
if
the
bull
run
bridge
had
not
been
burned
on
the
our
supplies
could
have
been
run
to
alexandria
if
we
could
have
advanced
as
easily
as
to
manassas
for
the
enemy
had
repaired
the
railroad
to
fairfax
station
as
he
moved
up
and
failed
to
destroy
it
when
he
went
back
moreover
we
had
abundant
transportation
at
that
time
for
all
the
purposes
of
an
advance
as
far
as
washington
in
my
brigade
the
two
virginia
regiments
had
about
fourteen
wagons
each
and
that
would
have
furnished
enough
for
the
brigade
if
the
seventh
louisiana
had
none
in
we
carried
into
maryland
only
enough
wagons
to
convey
ammunition
medical
supplies
and
and
we
started
from
the
of
second
manassas
with
no
rations
on
hand
being
before
we
crossed
the
potomac
entirely
dependent
on
the
country
which
in
july
was
teeming
with
supplies
but
in
august
and
september
was
nearly
depleted
the
pretense
therefore
that
the
advance
in
july
was
prevented
by
the
want
of
transportation
and
of
supplies
is
wholly
untenable
i
will
now
make
the
promised
extracts
from
reminiscences
of
colonel
then
captain
lay
which
were
sent
to
a
friend
and
handed
to
me
for
my
use
the
paper
bears
date
february
after
some
preliminary
matter
and
stating
that
his
force
consisted
of
three
cavalry
companies
the
narrative
proceeds
i
was
under
orders
to
be
in
the
saddle
at
july
and
to
report
immediately
to
general
beauregard
at
his
headquarters
about
i
accompanied
him
and
general
johnston
to
a
position
near
to
mitchell
ford
where
for
some
hours
we
remained
under
an
active
fire
of
the
guns
of
the
enemy
upon
the
opposite
hills
when
the
unexpected
flank
movement
of
the
enemy
was
developed
with
the
generals
named
we
rode
at
rapid
speed
to
the
left
when
general
beauregard
immediately
rode
to
the
front
general
johnston
taking
position
near
and
to
the
left
of
the
lewis
house
about
captain
lindsey
walker
with
his
battery
took
position
to
the
left
and
in
front
of
the
lewis
house
and
commenced
firing
i
was
near
him
when
the
shot
from
his
battery
was
fired
and
watched
its
effect
as
it
swept
through
the
columns
of
the
enemy
producing
perfect
confusion
and
demoralization
i
rode
to
join
my
brother
colonel
lay
whom
i
saw
going
toward
my
command
from
general
johnston
he
reported
to
me
that
general
johnston
said
is
your
time
push
the
pursuit
i
started
at
once
on
a
trot
was
passing
general
johnston
who
gave
some
orders
and
i
understood
him
to
say
the
president
in
passing
i
saluted
and
passed
on
at
a
gallop
i
halted
at
bull
run
to
water
my
horses
then
suffering
and
to
confer
a
moment
or
two
with
my
gallant
old
commander
general
philip
george
cocke
i
passed
on
when
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
the
president
near
me
in
the
orchard
i
immediately
rode
up
to
him
and
said
that
he
was
much
farther
forward
than
he
should
be
that
the
forces
of
the
enemy
were
not
entirely
broken
and
very
few
of
our
troops
in
front
of
the
run
and
advised
him
to
retire
that
i
was
then
about
to
charge
we
made
the
charge
a
small
body
of
the
enemy
broke
before
we
reached
them
and
scattered
and
the
larger
body
of
troops
beyond
proved
to
be
of
our
own
troops
rapidly
advancing
upon
our
left
after
parting
from
the
president
i
pushed
on
to
sudley
church
and
far
beyond
sent
my
surgeon
randolph
barksdale
to
captains
tillinghast
ricketts
and
other
badly
wounded
united
states
officers
and
was
going
on
until
a
superior
force
should
stop
me
but
was
recalled
by
an
order
and
returned
over
the
field
to
my
quarters
at
manassas
a
little
before
daylight
i
and
my
little
gallant
squadron
having
been
actively
in
the
saddle

more
than
twenty
hours
signed

it
may
be
well
to
add
that
general
lindsey
walker
then
captain
walker
of
the
battery
referred
to
is
now
in
my
office
and
confirms
my
recollection
the
of
general
beauregard
command
cabell
states
in
a
letter
written
at
dallas
texas
on
the
of
august
in
regard
to
the
field
transportation
of
general
forces
before
the
battle
of
manassas
that
as
nearly
as
he
could
remember
it
was
as
follows
viz
one
wagon
to
each
company
one
for
field
and
staff
regimental
one
ammunition
one
hospital
purposes
two
wagons
each
battery
of
artillery
wagons
in
a
train
for
depot
purposes
one
ambulance
for
each
regiment
transportation
belonging
to
general
johnston
army
did
not
arrive
until
the
day
or
probably
two
days
after
the
battle
if
general
johnston
as
stated
had
nine
thousand
infantry
the
field
transportation
reported
above
could
surely
have
been
distributed
so
as
to
supply
this
additional
force
and
have
rendered
as
general
early
states
the
pretense
wholly
untenable
that
the
advance
in
july
was
prevented
by
want
of
transportation
the
deep
anxiety
which
had
existed
and
was
justified
by
the
circumstances
had
corresponding
gratification
among
all
classes
and
in
all
sections
of
our
country
on
the
day
after
the
victory
the
congress
then
sitting
in
richmond
upon
receiving
the
dispatch
of
the
president
from
the
field
of
manassas
adopted
resolutions
expressive
of
their
thanks
to
the
most
high
god
and
inviting
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
to
offer
up
their
united
thanksgiving
and
praise
for
the
mighty
deliverance
the
resolutions
also
deplored
the
necessity
which
had
caused
the
soil
of
our
country
to
be
stained
with
the
blood
of
its
sons
and
to
their
families
and
friends
offered
the
most
cordial
sympathy
assuring
them
that
in
the
hearts
of
our
people
would
be
enshrined
the
names
of
the
gallant
dead
as
the
champions
of
free
and
constitutional
liberty
if
universal
gratulation
at
our
success
inspired
an
overweening
confidence
it
also
begat
increased
desire
to
enter
the
military
service
and
but
for
our
want
of
arms
and
munitions
we
could
have
enrolled
an
army
little
short
of
the
number
of
men
in
the
confederate
states
i
have
given
so
much
space
to
the
battle
of
manassas
because
it
was
the
first
great
action
of
the
war
exciting
intense
feeling
and
producing
important
moral
results
among
the
people
of
the
confederacy
and
further
because
it
was
made
the
basis
of
misrepresentation
and
unjust
reflection
upon
the
chief
executive
which
certainly
had
no
plausible
pretext
in
the
facts
and
can
not
be
referred
to
a
reasonable
desire
to
promote
the
successful
defense
of
our
country
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
time
would
naturally
work
to
our
disadvantage
as
training
was
more
necessary
to
make
soldiers
of
the
northern
people
than
of
our
own
and
further
because
of
their
larger
population
as
well
as
their
greater
facility
in
obtaining
recruits
from
foreign
countries
the
administration
continued
assiduously
to
exert
every
faculty
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
army
by
addition
to
its
numbers
by
improving
its
organization
and
by
supplying
the
needful
munitions
and
equipments
inactivity
is
the
prolific
source
of
evil
to
an
army
especially
if
composed
of
new
levies
who
like
ours
had
hurried
from
their
homes
at
their
country
call
for
these
and
other
reasons
more
readily
appreciated
it
was
thought
desirable
that
all
our
available
forces
should
be
employed
as
actively
as
might
be
practicable
on
the
of
august

looking

kentucky
the
eldest
daughter
of

had
moved
contemporaneously
with
her
mother
in
the
assertion
of
the
cardinal
principles
announced
in
the
resolutions
of
she
then
by
the
properly
constituted
authority
did
with
due
solemnity
declare
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
the
result
of
a
compact
between
the
states
to
which
each
acceded
as
a
state
that
it
possessed
only
delegated
powers
of
which
it
was
not
the
exclusive
or
final
judge
and
that
as
in
all
cases
of
compact
among
parties
having
no
common
judge
each
party
has
an
equal
right
to
judge
for
itself
as
well
of
infractions
as
of
the
mode
and
measure
of
redress
thus
spoke
kentucky
in
the
first
years
of
her
existence
as
a
sovereign
the
great
truth
announced
in
her
series
of
resolutions
was
the
sign
under
which
the
democracy
conquered
in
and
which
constituted
the
of
the
political
edifice
of
which
jefferson
was
the
architect
and
which
stood
unshaken
for
sixty
years
from
the
time
its
foundation
was
laid
during
this
period
the
growth
prosperity
and
happiness
of
the
country
seemed
unmistakably
to
confirm
the
wisdom
of
the
voluntary
union
of
free
sovereign
states
under
a
written
compact
confining
the
action
of
the
general
government
to
the
expressly
enumerated
powers
which
had
been
delegated
therein
when
infractions
of
the
compact
had
been
deliberately
and
persistently
made
when
the
intent
was
clearly
manifested
to
pervert
the
powers
of
the
general
government
from
the
purposes
for
which
they
had
been
conferred
and
to
use
them
for
the
injury
of
a
portion
of
the
states
which
were
the
integral
parties
to
the
compact
some
of
them
resolved
to
judge
for
themselves
of
the
mode
and
measure
of
redress
and
to
exercise
the
right
enunciated
in
the
declaration
of
independence
to
be
the
unalienable
endowment
of
every
people
to
alter
or
abolish
any
form
of
government
and
to
institute
a
new
one
laying
its
foundation
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
by
no
rational
mode
of
construction
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
declaration
of
independence
or
of
the
resolutions
of
kentucky
can
it
be
claimed
that
the
word
people
had
any
other
meaning
than
that
of
a
distinct
community
such
as
the
people
of
each
colony
who
by
their
delegates
in
the
congress
declared
themselves
to
be
henceforth
a
state
and
that
none
other
than
the
people
of
each
state
could
by
the
resolutions
of
have
been
referred
to
as
the
final
judge
of
infractions
of
their
compact
and
of
the
remedy
which
should
be
applied
kentucky
made
no
decision
adverse
to
this
right
of
a
state
but
she
declared
in
the
impending
conflict
between
the
states
seceding
from
and
those
adhering
to
the
federal
government
that
she
would
hold
the
position
of
neutrality
if
the
question
was
to
be
settled
by
a
war
of
words
that
was
feasible
but
if
the
conflict
was
to
be
one
of
arms
it
was
utterly
impracticable
to
maintain
neutrality
under
such
circumstances
would
have
required
a
power
greater
than
that
of
both
the
contestants
or
a
moral
influence
commanding
such
respect
for
her
wishes
as
could
hardly
have
been
anticipated
from
that
party
which
had
in
violation
of
right
inflicted
the
wrongs
which
produced
the
withdrawal
of
some
of
the
states
and
had
uttered
multiplied
threats
of
coercion
if
any
state
attempted
to
exercise
the
rights
defined
in
the
resolutions
of
if
however
any
such
hope
may
have
been
entertained
but
few
moons
had
filled
and
waned
before
the
defiant
occupation
of
her
territory
and
the
enrollment
of
her
citizens
as
soldiers
in
the
army
of
invasion
must
have
dispelled
the
illusion
the
following
correspondence
took
place
in
august
between
governor
magoffin
of
kentucky
and
president
lincoln
also
between
the
governor
and
myself
as
president
of

states
relative
to
the
neutrality
of
the
state
commonwealth
of
kentucky
executive
department
frankfort
to
his
excellency
abraham
lincoln
of
the
united
sir
from
the
commencement
of
the
unhappy
hostilities
now
pending
in
this
country
the
people
of
kentucky
have
indicated
an
earnest
desire
and
purpose
as
far
as
lay
in
their
power
while
maintaining
their
original
political
status
to
do
nothing
by
which
to
involve
themselves
in
the
war
up
to
this
time
they
have
succeeded
in
securing
to
themselves
and
to
the
state
peace
and
tranquillity
as
the
fruits
of
the
policy
they
adopted
my
single
object
now
is
to
promote
the
continuance
of
these
blessings
to
this
state
until
within
a
brief
period
the
people
of
kentucky
were
quiet
and
tranquil
free
from
domestic
strife
and
undisturbed
by
internal
commotion
they
have
resisted
no
law
rebelled
against
no
authority
engaged
in
no
revolution
but
constantly
proclaimed
their
firm
determination
to
pursue
their
peaceful
avocations
earnestly
hoping
that
their
own
soil
would
be
spared
the
presence
of
armed
troops
and
that
the
scene
of
conflict
would
be
kept
removed
beyond
the
border
of
their
state
by
thus
avoiding
all
occasions
for
the
introduction
of
bodies
of
armed
soldiers
and
offering
no
provocation
for
the
presence
of
military
force
the
people
of
kentucky
have
sincerely
striven
to
preserve
in
their
state
domestic
peace
and
avert
the
calamities
of
sanguinary
engagements
recently
a
large
body
of
soldiers
have
been
enlisted
in
the
united
states
army
and
collected
in
military
camps
in
the
central
portion
of
kentucky
this
movement
was
preceded
by
the
active
organization
of
companies
regiments
consisting
of
men
sworn
into
the
united
states
service
under
officers
holding
commissions
from
yourself
ordnance
arms
munitions
and
supplies
of
war
are
being
transported
into
the
state
and
placed
in
large
quantities
in
these
camps
in
a
word
an
army
is
now
being
organized
and
quartered
within
the
state
supplied
with
all
the
appliances
of
war
without
the
consent
or
advice
of
the
authorities
of
the
state
and
without
consultation
with
those
most
prominently
known
and
recognized
as
loyal
citizens
this
movement
now
imperils
that
peace
and
tranquillity
which
from
the
beginning
of
our
pending
difficulties
have
been
the
paramount
desire
of
this
people
and
which
up
to
this
time
they
have
so
secured
to
the
state
within
kentucky
there
has
been
and
is
likely
to
be
no
occasion
for
the
presence
of
military
force
the
people
are
quiet
and
tranquil
feeling
no
apprehension
of
any
occasion
arising
to
invoke
protection
from
the
federal
arm
they
have
asked
that
their
territory
be
left
free
from
military
occupation
and
the
present
tranquillity
of
their
communication
left
uninvaded
by
soldiers
they
do
not
desire
that
kentucky
shall
be
required
to
supply
the
for
the
contending
armies
or
become
the
theatre
of
the
war
now
therefore
as
governor
of
the
state
of
kentucky
and
in
the
name
of
the
people
i
have
the
honor
to
represent
and
with
the
single
and
earnest
desire
to
avert
from
their
peaceful
homes
the
horrors
of
war
i
urge
the
removal
from
the
limits
of
kentucky
of
the
military
force
now
organized
and
in
camp
within
the
state
if
such
action
as
is
here
urged
be
promptly
taken
i
firmly
believe
the
peace
of
the
people
of
kentucky
will
be
preserved
and
the
horrors
of
a
bloody
war
will
be
averted
from
a
people
now
peaceful
and
tranquil
i
am
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
b
magoffin
washington
to
his
excellency
magoffin
of
the
state
of
sir
your
letter
of
the
instant
in
which
you
the
removal
from
the
limits
of
kentucky
of
the
military
force
now
organized
and
in
camp
within
that
state
is
received
i
may
not
possess
full
and
precisely
accurate
knowledge
upon
this
subject
but
i
believe
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
military
force
in
camp
within
kentucky
acting
by
authority
of
the
united
states
which
force
is
not
very
large
and
is
not
now
being
augmented
i
also
believe
that
some
arms
have
been
furnished
to
this
force
by
the
united
states
i
also
believe
this
force
consists
exclusively
of
kentuckians
having
their
camp
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
their
own
homes
and
not
assailing
or
menacing
any
of
the
good
people
of
kentucky
in
all
i
have
done
in
the
premises
i
have
acted
upon
the
urgent
solicitation
of
many
kentuckians
and
in
accordance
with
what
i
believed
and
still
believe
to
be
the
wish
of
a
majority
of
all
the
people
of
kentucky
while
i
have
conversed
on
this
subject
with
many
of
the
eminent
men
of
kentucky
including
a
large
majority
of
her
members
of
congress
i
do
not
remember
that
any
one
of
them
or
any
other
person
except
your
excellency
and
the
bearers
of
your
excellency
letter
has
urged
me
to
remove
the
military
force
from
kentucky
or
to
disband
it
one
very
worthy
citizen
of
kentucky
did
solicit
me
to
have
the
augmenting
of
the
force
suspended
for
a
time
taking
all
the
means
within
my
reach
to
form
a
judgment
i
do
not
believe
it
is
the
popular
wish
of
kentucky
that
this
force
shall
be
removed
beyond
her
limits
and
with
this
impression
i
must
respectfully
decline
to
so
remove
it
i
most
cordially
sympathize
with
your
excellency
in
the
wish
to
preserve
the
peace
of
my
own
native
state
kentucky
it
is
with
regret
i
search
for
and
can
not
find
in
your
not
very
short
letter
any
declaration
or
intimation
that
you
entertain
any
desire
for
the
preservation
of

authorities
within
this
state
i
have
on
this
day
addressed
a
communication
and
dispatched
commissioners
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
urging
the
removal
of
these
troops
from
the
soil
of
kentucky
and
thus
exerting
myself
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
people
in
the
maintenance
of
a
neutral
position
the
people
of
this
state
desire
to
be
free
from
the
presence
of
the
soldiers
of
either
belligerent
and
to
that
end
my
efforts
are
now
directed
although
i
have
no
reason
to
presume
that
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
contemplate
or
have
ever
proposed
any
violation
of
the
neutral
attitude
thus
assumed
by
kentucky
there
seems
to
be
some
uneasiness
felt
among
the
people
of
some
portion
of
the
state
occasioned
by
the
collection
of
bodies
of
troops
along
their
southern
frontier
in
order
to
quiet
this
apprehension
and
to
secure
to
the
people
their
cherished
object
of
peace
this
communication
is
to
present
these
facts
and
elicit
an
authoritative
assurance
that
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
will
continue
to
respect
and
observe
the
position
indicated
as
assumed
by
kentucky
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
b
magoffin
richmond
to
hon
magoffin
of
kentucky
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
informing
me
that
the
commencement
of
the
unhappy
difficulties
pending
in
the
country
the
people
of
kentucky
have
indicated
a
steadfast
desire
to
maintain
a
position
of
strict
neutrality
between
the
belligerent
parties
in
the
same
communication
you
express
your
desire
to
elicit
authoritative
assurance
that
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
will
continue
to
respect
and
observe
the
neutral
position
of
kentucky
in
reply
to
this
request
i
lose
no
time
in
assuring
you
that
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
neither
desires
nor
intends
to
disturb
the
neutrality
of
kentucky
the
assemblage
of
troops
in
tennessee
to
which
you
refer
had
no
other
object
than
to
repel
the
lawless
invasion
of
that
state
by
the
forces
of
the
united
states
should
their
government
seek
to
approach
it
through
kentucky
without
respect
for
its
position
of
neutrality
that
such
apprehensions
were
not
groundless
has
been
proved
by
the
course
of
that
government
in
the
states
of
maryland
and
missouri
and
more
recently
in
kentucky
itself
in
which
as
you
inform
me
military
force
has
been
enlisted
and
quartered
by
the
united
states
authorities
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
has
not
only
respected
most
scrupulously
the
neutrality
of
kentucky
but
has
continued
to
maintain
the
friendly
relations
of
trade
and
intercourse
which
it
has
suspended
with
the
united
states
generally
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
past
it
can
scarcely
be
necessary
to
assure
your
excellency
that
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
will
continue
to
respect
the
neutrality
of
kentucky
so
long
as
her
people
will
maintain
it
themselves
but
neutrality
to
be
entitled
to
respect
must
be
strictly
maintained
between
both
parties
or
if
the
door
be
opened
on
the
one
side
for
the
aggressions
of
one
of
the
belligerent
parties
upon
the
other
it
ought
not
to
be
shut
to
the
assailed
when
they
seek
to
enter
it
for
purposes
of
i
do
not
however
for
a
moment
believe
that
your
gallant
state
will
suffer
its
soil
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
giving
an
advantage
to
those
who
violate
its
neutrality
and
disregard
its
rights
over
others
who
respect
both
in
conclusion
i
tender
to
your
excellency
the
assurance
of
my
high
consideration
and
regard
and
am
sir
very
respectfully
yours
jefferson
davis
movements
by
the
federal
forces
in
southwestern
kentucky
revealed
such
designs
as
made
it
absolutely
necessary
that
general
polk
commanding
the
confederate
forces
in
that
section
should
immediately
occupy
the
town
of
columbus
kentucky
a
position
of
much
strategic
importance
on
the
shore
of
the
mississippi
river
that
position
was
doubly
important
because
it
commanded
the
opposite
shore
in
missouri
and
was
the
gateway
on
the
border
of
tennessee
two
states
of
the
confederacy
were
therefore
threatened
by
the
anticipated
movement
of
the
enemy
to
get
possession
of
columbus
polk
therefore
crossed
the
state
line
took
possession
of
hickman
on
september
and
on
the
secured
columbus
general
grant
who
took
command
at
cairo
on
september
being
thus
anticipated
seized
paducah
at
the
mouth
of
the
tennessee
river
and
occupied
it
in
force
on
the
and
after
the
occupation
under
date
of
september
i
received
the
following
dispatch
from
polk
the
enemy
having
descended
the
mississippi
river
some
three
or
four
days
since
and
seated
himself
with
cannon
and
entrenched
lines
opposite
the
town
of
columbus
kentucky
making
such
demonstrations
as
left
no
doubt
upon
the
minds
of
any
of
their
intention
to
seize
and
forcibly
possess
said
town
i
thought
proper
under
the
plenary
power
delegated
to
me
to
direct
a
sufficient
portion
of
my
command
both
by
the
river
way
and
land
to
concentrate
at
columbus
as
well
to
offer
to
its
citizens
that
protection
they
unite
to
a
man
in
accepting
as
also
to
prevent
in
time
the
occupation
by
the
enemy
of
a
point
so
necessary
to
the
security
of
western
tennessee
the
demonstration
on
my
part
has
had
the
desired
effect
the
enemy
has
withdrawn
his
forces
even
before
i
had
fortified
my
position
it
is
my
intention
to
continue
to
occupy
and
hold
this
place
on
the
same
day
i
sent
the
following
reply
to
polk
your
telegram
received
the
necessity

justify
the
action
the
legislature
of
kentucky

resolutions
and
appointed
a
committee
to
inquire
into
the
action
of
general
polk
from
which
the
annexed
correspondence
resulted

sir
i
have
the
honor
to
inclose
herewith
a
resolution
of
the
senate
of
kentucky
adopted
by
that
body
upon
the
reception
of
the
intelligence
of
the
military
occupation
of
hickman
chalk
bank
and
columbus
by
the
confederate
troops
under
your
command
i
need
not
say
that
the
people
of
kentucky
are
profoundly
astonished
that
such
an
act
should
have
been
committed
by
the
confederates
and
especially
that
they
should
have
been
the
first
to
do
so
with
an
equipped
and
regularly
organized
army
the
people
of
kentucky
having
with
great
unanimity
determined
upon
a
position
of
neutrality
in
the
unhappy
war
now
being
waged
and
which
they
had
tried
in
vain
to
prevent
had
hoped
that
one
place
at
least
in
this
great
nation
might
remain
uninvaded
by
passion
and
through
whose
good
office
something
might
be
done
to
end
the
war
or
at
least
to
mitigate
its
horrors
or
if
this
were
not
possible
that
she
might
be
left
to
choose
her
destiny
without
disturbance
from
any
quarter
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
the
people
as
expressed
at
the
polls
and
in
their
name
i
ask
you
to
withdraw
your
forces
from
the
soil
of
kentucky
i
will
say
in
conclusion
that
all
the
people
of
the
state
await
in
deep
suspense
your
action
in
the
premises

i
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
the

of
your
letter
of
this

conveying
to
me
a
copy
of
a
resolution
of
the
senate
of

under
which
a
committee
of
which
you
are
chairman
was
raised
the
purpose
of
considering
the
reported
occupation
of
hickman
and
other
points
in

by
the
confederate
troops
and
that
they
take
into

the
reported
occupation
of

by

report

in

by

and
report
in
writing
at
as
early
a
day
as
practicable
from
the
terms
of
the
resolution
it
appears
your
office
as
was
restricted
merely
to
collecting
the
facts
in
reference
to
the
recent
occupation
of
kentucky
soil
by
the
confederate
and
federal
forces
and
to
report
thereon
in
writing
at
as
early
a
day
as
possible
in
answer
to
these
resolutions
i
have
respectfully
to
say
that
so
far
as
the
confederate
forces
are
concerned
the
facts
are
plain
and
shortly
stated
the
government
which
they
represent
recognizing
as
a
fundamental
principle
the
right
of
sovereign
states
to
take
such
a
position
as
they
choose
in
regard
to
their
relations
with
other
states
was
compelled
by
that
principle
to
concede
to
kentucky
the
right
to
assume
the
position
of
neutrality
which
she
has
chosen
in
the
passing
struggle
this
it
has
done
on
all
occasions
and
without
an
exception
the
cases
alluded
to
by
his
excellency
governor
magoffin
in
his
recent
message
as
i
presume
are
the
cases
of
the
steamers
cheney
and
orr
the
former
was
the
unauthorized
and
unrecognized
act
of
certain
citizens
of
alabama
and
the
latter
the
act
of
citizens
of
tennessee
and
others
and
was
an
act
of
reprisal
they
can
not
therefore
be
charged
in
any
sense
as
acts
of
the
confederate
government
the
first
and
only
instance
in
which
the
neutrality
of
kentucky
has
been
disregarded
is
that
in
which
the
troops
under
my
command
and
by
my
direction
took
possession
of
the
place
i
now
hold
and
so
much
of
the
territory
between
it
and
the
tennessee
line
as
was
necessary
for
me
to
pass
over
in
order
to
reach
it
this
act
finds
abundant
justification
in
the
history
of
the
concessions
granted
to
the
federal
government
by
kentucky
ever
since
the
war
began
notwithstanding
the
position
of
neutrality
which
she
had
assumed
and
the
firmness
with
which
she
proclaimed
her
intention
to
maintain
it
that
history
shows
the
following
among
other
facts
in
january
the
house
of
representatives
of
kentucky
passed
resolutions
only
four
dissenting
the
governor
in
may
issued
his
neutrality
proclamation
the
address
of
the
union
central
committee
including
james
speed
prentice
and
other
prominent
union
men
in
april
proclaimed
neutrality
as
the
policy
of
kentucky
and
claimed
that
an
attempt
to
coerce
the
south
should
induce
kentucky
to
make
common
cause
with
her
and
take
part
in
the
contest
on
her
side
counting
the
cost
the
union
speakers
and
papers
with
few
exceptions
claimed
up
to
the
last
election
that
the
union
vote
was
strict
neutrality
and
peace
these
facts
and
events
gave
assurance
of
the
integrity
of
the
avowed
purpose
of
your
state
and
we
were
content
with
the
position
she
assumed
since
the
election
however
she
has
allowed
the
seizure
in
her
port
paducah
of
property
of
citizens
of
the
confederate
states
she
has
by
her
members
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
voted
supplies
of
men
and
money
to
carry
on
the
war
against
the
confederate
states
she
has
allowed
the
federal
government
to
cut
timber
from
her
forests
for
the
purpose
of
building
armed
boats
for
the
invasion
of
the
southern
states
she
is
permitting
to
be
enlisted
in
her
territory
troops
not
only
of
her
own
citizens
but
of
the
citizens
of
other
states
for
the
purpose
of
being
armed
and
used
in
offensive
warfare
against
the
confederate
states
at
camp
robinson
in
the
county
of
garrard
there
are
now
ten
thousand
troops
if
the
newspapers
can
be
relied
upon
in
which
men
from
tennessee
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
are
mustered
with
kentuckians
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
and
armed
by
that
government
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
giving
aid
to
the
disaffected
in
one
of
the
confederate
states
and
of
carrying
out
the
designs
of
that
government
for
their
subjugation
notwithstanding
all
these
and
other
acts
of
a
similar
character
the
confederate
states
have
continued
to
respect
the
attitude
which
kentucky
had
assumed
as
a
neutral
and
forborne
from
reprisals
in
the
hope
that
kentucky
would
yet
enforce
respect
for
her
position
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
our
patient
expectation
has
been
disappointed
and
it
was
only
when
we
perceived
that
this
continued
indifference
to
our
rights
and
our
safety
was
about
to
culminate
in
the
seizure
of
an
important
part
of
her
territory
by
the
united
states
forces
for
offensive
operations
against
the
confederate
states
that
a
regard
for
demanded
of
us
to
seize
it
in
advance
we
are
here
therefore
not
by
choice
but
of
necessity
and
as
i
have
had
the
honor
to
say
in
a
communication
addressed
to
his
excellency
governor
magoffin
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
inclosed
and
submitted
as
a
part
of
my
reply
so
i
now
repeat
in
answer
to
your
request
that
i
am
prepared
to
agree
to
withdraw
the
confederate
troops
from
kentucky
provided
she
will
agree
that
the
troops
of
the
federal
government
be
withdrawn
simultaneously
with
a
guarantee
which
i
will
give
reciprocally
for
the
confederate
government
that
the
federal
troops
shall
not
be
allowed
to
enter
nor
occupy
any
part
of
kentucky
for
the
future
in
view
of
the
facts
thus
submitted
i
can
not
but
think
the
world
at
large
will
find
it
difficult
to
appreciate
the
astonishment
with
which
you
say
the
people
of
kentucky
received
the
intelligence
of
the
occupation
of
this
place
i
have
the
honor
to
be
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
leonidas
polk
from
general
polk
to
governor
columbus
kentucky
governor
magoffin
i
should
have
dispatched
to
you
immediately
as
the
troops
under
my
command
took
possession
of
this
position
the
very
few
words
i
addressed
to
the
people
here
but
my
duties
since
that
time
have
so
preoccupied
me
that
i
have
but
now
the
first
leisure
moment
to
communicate
with
you
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
inform
you
as
my
short
address
herewith
will
do
that
i
had
information
on
which
i
could
rely
that
the
federal
forces
intended
and
were
preparing
to
seize
columbus
i
need
not
describe
to
you
the
danger
resulting
to
western
tennessee
from
such
occupation
my
responsibility
could
not
permit
me
quietly
to
lose
to
the
command
intrusted
to
me
so
important
a
position
in
evidence
of
the
accuracy
of
the
information
i
possessed
i
will
state
that
as
the
confederate
force
approached
this
place
the
federal
troops
were
found
in
formidable
numbers
in
position
upon
the
opposite
bank
with
their
cannon
turned
upon
columbus
the
citizens
of
the
town
had
fled
with
terror
and
not
a
word
of
assurance
of
safety
or
protection
had
been
addressed
to
them
since
i
have
taken
possession
of
this
place
i
have
been
informed
by
highly
respected
citizens
of
your
state
that
certain
representatives
of
the
federal
government
are
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
its
own
wrong
are
setting
up
complaints
against
my
acts
of
occupation
and
are
making
it
a
pretest
for
seizing
other
points
upon
this
proceeding
i
have
no
comments
to
make
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
i
will
agree
to
withdraw
the
confederate
troops
from
kentucky
provided
that
she
will
agree
that
the
troops
of
the
federal
government
be
withdrawn
simultaneously
with
a
guarantee
which
i
will
give
reciprocally
for
the
confederate
government
that
the
federal
troops
shall
not
be
allowed
to
enter
or
occupy
any
part
of
kentucky
in
the
future
i
have
the
honor
to
be
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
signed
leonidas
polk
however
willing
the
government
of
kentucky
might
have
been
to
accede
to
the
proposition
of
general
polk
and
which
from
his
knowledge
of
the
views
of
his
own
government
he
was
fully
justified
in
offering
the
state
of
kentucky
had
no
power
moral
or
physical
to
prevent
the
united
states
government
from
using
her
soil
as
best
might
suit
its
purposes
in
the
war
it
was
waging
for
the
subjugation
of
the
seceded
states
president
lincoln
in
his
message
of
the
previous
july
had
distinctly
and
reproachfully
spoken
of
the
idea
of
neutrality
as
existing
in
some
of
the
border
states
he
said
to
prevent
the
union
forces
passing
one
way
or
the
disunion
the
other
over
their
soil
would
be
disunion
completed
at
a
stroke
it
would
take
all
the
trouble
off
the
hands
of
secession
except
only
what
proceeds
from
the
external
blockade
the
acts
of
the
federal
government
corresponded
with
the
views
announced
by
its
president
briefly
but
conclusively
general
polk
showed
in
his
answer
that
the
united
states
government
paid
no
respect
to
the
neutral
position
which
kentucky
wished
to
maintain
that
it
was
armed
but
not
neutral
for
the
arms
and
the
troops
assembled
on
her
soil
were
for
the
invasion
of
the
south
and
that
he
occupied
columbus
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
taking
possession
of
it
when
our
troops
first
entered
columbus
they
found
the
inhabitants
had
been
in
alarm
from
demonstrations
of
the
united
states
forces
but
that
they
felt
no
dread
of
the
confederate
troops
as
far
as
the
truth
could
be
ascertained
a
decided
majority
of
the
people
of
kentucky
especially
its
southwestern
portion
if
left
to
a
free
choice
would
have
joined
the
confederacy
in
preference
to
remaining
in
the
union
could
they
have
foreseen
what
in
a
short
time
was
revealed
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
mule
contracts
and
other
forms
of
bribery
would
have
proved
unavailing
to
make
her
the
passive
observer
of
usurpations
destructive
of
the
personal
and
political
rights
of
which
she
had
always
been
a
most
earnest
advocate
with
the
slow
and
sinuous
approach
of
the
serpent
the
general
government
little
by
little
gained
power
over
kentucky
and
then
throwing
off
the
mask
proceeded
to
outrages
so
regardless
of
law
and
the
usages
of
people
as
could
not
have
been
anticipated
and
can
only
be
remembered
with
shame
by
those
who
honor
the
constitutional
government
created
by
the
states
while
artfully
urging
the
maintenance
of
the
union
as
a
duty
of
patriotism
the
constitution
which
gave
the
union
birth
was
trampled
under
foot
and
the
excesses
of
the
reign
of
terror
which
followed
the
french
revolution
were
reënacted
in
our
land
once
the
vaunted
home
of
law
and
liberty
men
who
had
been
most
honored
by
the
state
and
who
had
reflected
back
most
honor
upon
it
were
seized
without
warrant
condemned
without
trial
because
they
had
exercised
the
privilege
of
free
speech
and
for
adhering
to
the
principles
which
were
the
on
which
our
fathers
builded
our
political
temple
members
of
the
legislature
vacated
their
seats
and
left
the
state
to
avoid
arrest
the
penalty
hanging
over
them
for
opinion
sake
the
venerable
judge
monroe
who
had
presided
over
the
united
states
district
court
for
more
than
a
generation
driven
from
the
land
of
his
birth
the
state
he
had
served
so
long
and
so
well
with
feeble
step
but
upright
conscience
and
indomitable
will
sought
a
resting
place
among
those
who
did
not
regard
it
a
crime
to
adhere
to
the
principles
of
and
of
and
the
declaratory
affirmation
of
them
in
the
resolutions
of
about
the
same
time
others
of
great
worth
and
distinction
impelled
by
the
feeling
that
where
liberty
is
there
is
my
country
left
the
land
desecrated
by
despotic
usurpation
to
join
the
confederacy
in
its
struggle
to
maintain
the
personal
and
political
liberties
which
the
men
of
the
revolution
had
left
as
an
inheritance
to
their
posterity
space
would
not
suffice
for
a
complete
list
of
the
refugees
who
became
conspicuous
in
the
military
events
of
the
confederacy
let
a
few
answer
for
the
many
breckinridge
the
late
of
the
united
states
and
whose
general
and
popularity
might
have
reasonably
led
him
to
expect
in
the
union
the
highest
honors
the
states
could
bestow
william
preston
george
johnston
buckner
john
morgan
and
a
host
of
others
alike
meritorious
and
alike
gratefully
remembered
when
the
passions
of
the
hour
shall
have
subsided
and
the
past
shall
be
reviewed
with
discrimination
and
justice
the
question
must
arise
in
every
reflecting
mind
why
did
such
men
as
these
expatriate
themselves
and
surrender
all
the
advantages
which
they
had
won
by
a
life
of
honorable
effort
in
the
land
of
their
nativity
to
such
inquiry
the
answer
must
be
the
usurpations
of
the
general
government
foretold
to
them
the
wreck
of
constitutional
liberty
the
motives
which
governed
them
may
best
be
learned
from
the
annexed
extracts
from
the
statement
made
in
the
address
of
breckinridge
to
the
people
of
kentucky
whom
he
had
represented
in
both
houses
of
the
united
states
congress
with
such
distinguished
ability
and
zeal
for
the
general
welfare
as
to
place
him
in
the
front
rank
of
the
statesmen
of
his
day
bowling
green
kentucky
in
obedience
as
i
supposed
to
your
wishes
i
proceeded
to
washington
and
at
the
special
session
of
congress
in
july
spoke
and
voted
against
the
whole
war
policy
of
the
president
and
congress
demanding
in
addition
for
kentucky
the
right
to
refuse
not
men
only
but
money
also
to
the
war
for
i
would
have
blushed
to
meet
you
with
the
confession
that
i
had
purchased
for
you
exemption
from
the
perils
of
the
and
the
shame
of
waging
war
against
your
southern
brethren
by
hiring
others
to
do
the
work
you
shrunk
from
performing
during
that
memorable
session
a
very
small
body
of
senators
and
representatives
even
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
military
despotism
resisted
the
usurpations
of
the
executive
and
with
what
degree
of
dignity
and
firmness
they
willingly
submit
to
the
judgment
of
the
world
their
efforts
were
unavailing
yet
they
may
prove
valuable
hereafter
as
another
added
to
former
examples
of
many
protest
against
the
progress
of
tyranny
on
my
return
to
kentucky
at
the
close
of
the
late
special
session
of
congress
it
was
my
purpose
immediately
to
resign
the
office
of
senator
the
verbal
and
written
remonstrances
of
many
friends
in
different
parts
of
the
state
induced
me
to
postpone
the
execution
of
my
purpose
but
the
time
has
arrived
to
carry
it
into
effect
and
accordingly
i
now
hereby
return
the
trust
into
your
hands
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
declared
that
the
south
should
be
reduced
to
submission
or
their
institutions
be
overthrown
in
the
senate
it
was
said
that
if
necessary
the
south
should
be
depopulated
and
repeopled
from
the
north
and
an
eminent
senator
expressed
a
desire
that
the
president
should
be
made
dictator
this
was
superfluous
since
they
had
already
clothed
him
with
dictatorial
powers
in
the
midst
of
these
proceedings
no
plea
for
the
constitution
is
listened
to
in
the
north
here
and
there
a
few
heroic
voices
are
feebly
heard
protesting
against
the
progress
of
despotism
but
for
the
most
part
beyond
the
military
lines
mobs
and
anarchy
rule
the
hour
the
great
mass
of
the
northern
people
seem
anxious
to
sunder
every
safeguard
of
freedom
they
eagerly
offer
to
the
government
what
no
european
monarch
would
dare
to
demand
the
president
and
his
generals
are
unable
to
pick
up
the
liberties
of
the
people
as
rapidly
as
they
are
thrown
at
their
feet
in
every
form
by
which
you
could
give
direct
expression
to
your
will
you
declared
for
neutrality
a
large
majority
of
the
people
at
the
may
and
august
elections
voted
for
the
neutrality
and
peace
of
kentucky
the
press
the
public
speakers
the
candidates
with
exceptions
in
favor
of
the
government
at
washington
so
rare
as
not
to
need
mention
planted
themselves
on
this
position
you
voted
for
it
and
you
meant
it
you
were
promised
it
and
you
expected
it
look
now
at
the
condition
of
kentucky
and
see
how
your
expectations
have
been
realized
how
these
promises
have
been
redeemed
general
anderson
the
military
dictator
of
kentucky
announces
in
one
of
his
proclamations
that
he
will
arrest
no
one
who
does
not
act
write
or
speak
in
opposition
to
lincoln
government
it
would
have
completed
the
idea
if
he
had
added
or
think
in
opposition
to
it
look
at
the
condition
of
our
state
under
the
rule
of
our
new
protectors
they
have
suppressed
the
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
they
seize
people
by
military
force
upon
mere
suspicion
and
impose
on
them
oaths
unknown
to
the
laws
other
citizens
they
imprison
without
warrant
and
carry
them
out
of
the
state
so
that
the
writ
of
can
not
reach
them
every
day
foreign
armed
bands
are
making
seizures
among
the
people
hundreds
of
citizens
old
and
young
venerable
magistrates
whose
lives
have
been
distinguished
by
the
love
of
the
people
have
been
compelled
to
fly
from
their
homes
and
families
to
escape
imprisonment
and
exile
at
the
hands
of
northern
and
german
soldiers
under
the
orders
of
lincoln
and
his
military
subordinates
while
yet
holding
an
important
political
trust
confided
by
kentucky
i
was
compelled
to
leave
my
home
and
family
or
suffer
imprisonment
and
exile
if
it
is
asked
why
i
did
not
meet
the
arrest
and
seek
a
trial
my
answer
is
that
i
would
have
welcomed
an
arrest
to
be
followed
by
a
judge
and
jury
but
you
well
know
that
i
could
not
have
secured
these
constitutional
rights
i
would
have
been
transported
beyond
the
state
to
languish
in
some
federal
fortress
during
the
pleasure
of
the
oppressor
witness
the
fate
of
morehead
and
his
kentucky
associates
in
their
distant
and
gloomy
prison
the
case
of
the
gentleman
just
mentioned
is
an
example
of
many
others
and
it
meets
every
element
in
a
definition
of
despotism
if
it
should
occur
in
england
it
would
be
righted
or
it
would
overturn
the
british
empire
he
is
a
citizen
and
native
of
kentucky
as
a
member
of
the
legislature
speaker
of
the
house
representative
in
congress
from
the
ashland
district
and
governor
of
the
state
you
have
known
trusted
and
honored
him
during
a
public
service
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
is
eminent
for
his
ability
his
amiable
character
and
his
blameless
life
yet
this
man
without
indictment
without
warrant
without
accusation
but
by
the
order
of
president
lincoln
was
seized
at
midnight
in
his
own
house
and
in
the
midst
of
his
own
family
and
led
through
the
streets
of
louisville
as
i
am
informed
with
his
hands
crossed
and
pinioned
before
him
was
carried
out
of
the
state
and
district
and
now
lies
a
prisoner
in
a
fortress
in
new
york
harbor
a
thousand
miles
away
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
these
invaders
unconstitutionally
swear
every
citizen
whom
they
unconstitutionally
seize
to
support
has
been
wholly
abolished
it
is
as
much
forgotten
as
if
it
lay
away
back
in
the
twilight
of
history
the
facts
i
have
enumerated
show
that
the
very
rights
most
carefully
reserved
by
it
to
the
states
and
to
individuals
have
been
most
conspicuously
violated
your
signed
john
c
breckinridge
such
was
the
neutrality
suffered
by
the
confederacy
from
governments
both
at
home
and
abroad
the
chivalric
people
of
kentucky
showed
their
sympathy
with
the
just
cause
of
the
people
of
the
southern
states
by
leaving
the
home
where
they
could
not
serve
the
cause
of
right
against
might
and
nobly
shared
the
fortunes
of
their
southern
brethren
on
many
a
field
in
like
manner
did
the
british
people
see
with
disapprobation
their
government
while
proclaiming
neutrality
make
new
rules
and
give
new
constructions
to
old
ones
so
as
to
favor
our
enemy
and
embarrass
us
the
englishman
sense
of
and
the
manly
instinct
which
predisposes
him
to
side
with
the
weak
gave
us
hosts
of
friends
but
all
their
good
intentions
were
paralyzed
or
foiled
by
their
wily
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
his
coadjutor
on
this
side
the
artful
unscrupulous
united
states
secretary
of
state
i
have
thus
presented
the
case
of
kentucky
not
because
it
was
the
only
state
where
false
promises
lulled
the
people
into
delusive
security
until
by
gradual
approaches
usurpation
had
bound
them
hand
and
foot
and
where
despotic
power
crushed
all
the
muniments
of
civil
liberty
which
the
union
was
formed
to
secure
but
because
of
the
attempt
which
has
been
noticed
to
arraign
the
confederacy
for
invasion
of
the
state
in
disregard
of
her
sovereignty
the
occupation
of
columbus
by
the
confederate
forces
was
only
just
soon
enough
to
anticipate
the
predetermined
purpose
of
the
federal
government
all
of
which
was
plainly
set
forth
in
the
letter
of
general
polk
to
the
governor
of
kentucky
and
his
subsequent
letter
to
the
kentucky
commissioners
missouri
like
kentucky
had
wished
to
preserve
peaceful
relations
in
the
contest
which
it
was
foreseen
would
soon
occur
between
the
northern
and
the
southern
states
when
the
federal
government
denied
to
her
the
privilege
of
choosing
her
own
position
which
betokened
no
hostility
to
the
general
government
and
she
was
driven
to
the
necessity
of
deciding
whether
or
not
her
citizens
should
be
used
for
the
subjugation
of
the
southern
states
her
people
and
their
representative
the
state
government
repelled
the
arbitrary
assumption
of
authority
by
military
force
to
control
her
government
and
her
people
among
other
acts
of
invasion
the
federal
troops
had
occupied
belmont
a
village
in
missouri
opposite
to
columbus
and
with
artillery
threatened
that
town
inspiring
terror
in
its
peaceful
inhabitants
after
the
occupation
of
columbus
under
these
circumstances
of
full
justification
a
small
confederate
force
colonel
tappan
arkansas
regiment
and
beltzhoover
battery
were
thrown
across
the
mississippi
to
occupy
and
hold
the
village
in
the
state
of
missouri
then
an
ally
and
soon
to
become
a
member
of
the
confederacy
on
the
of
november
general
grant
left
his
headquarters
at
cairo
with
a
land
and
naval
force
and
encamped
on
the
kentucky
shore
this
act
and
a
demonstration
made
by
detachments
from
his
force
at
paducah
were
probably
intended
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
contemplated
an
attack
on
columbus
thus
concealing
his
real
purpose
to
surprise
the
small
garrison
at
belmont
general
polk
on
the
morning
of
the
discovered
the
landing
of
the
federal
forces
on
the
missouri
shore
some
seven
miles
above
columbus
and
divining
the
real
purpose
of
the
enemy
detached
general
pillow
with
four
regiments
of
his
division
say
two
thousand
men
to
reënforce
the
garrison
at
belmont
very
soon
after
his
arrival
the
enemy
commenced
an
assault
which
was
sternly
resisted
and
with
varying
fortune
for
several
hours
the
enemy
front
so
far
exceeded
the
length
of
our
line
as
to
enable
him
to
attack
on
both
flanks
and
our
troops
were
finally
driven
back
to
the
bank
of
the
river
with
the
loss
of
their
battery
which
had
been
gallantly
and
efficiently
served
until
nearly
all
its
horses
had
been
killed
and
its
ammunition
had
been
expended
the
enemy
advanced
to
the
bank
of
the
river
below
the
point
to
which
our
men
had
retreated
and
opened
an
upon
the
town
of
columbus
to
which
our
guns
from
the
commanding
height
responded
with
such
effect
as
to
drive
him
from
the
river
bank
in
the
mean
time
general
polk
had
at
intervals
sent
three
regiments
to
reënforce
general
pillow
upon
the
arrival
of
the
first
of
these
general
pillow
led
it
to
a
favorable
position
where
it
for
some
time
steadily
resisted
and
checked
the
advance
of
the
enemy
general
pillow
with
great
energy
and
gallantry
rallied
his
repulsed
troops
and
brought
them
again
into
action
general
polk
now
proceeded
in
person
with
two
other
regiments
whether
from
this
or
some
other
cause
the
enemy
commenced
a
retreat
general
pillow
whose
activity
and
daring
on
the
occasion
were
worthy
of
all
praise
led
the
first
and
second
detachments
by
which
he
had
been
reënforced
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
rear
and
general
polk
landing
further
up
the
river
moved
to
cut
off
the
enemy
retreat
but
some
embarrassment
and
consequent
delay
which
occurred
in
landing
his
troops
caused
him
to
be
too
late
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
crossed
and
to
become
only
a
part
of
the
pursuing
force
one
would
naturally
suppose
that
the
question
about
which
there
would
be
the
greatest
certainty
would
be
the
number
of
troops
engaged
in
a
battle
yet
there
is
nothing
in
regard
to
which
we
have
such
conflicting
accounts
it
is
fairly
concluded
from
the
concurrent
reports
that
the
enemy
attacked
us
on
both
flanks
and
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
action
we
were
outnumbered
but
the
obstinacy
with
which
the
conflict
was
maintained
and
the
successive
advances
and
retreats
which
occurred
in
the
action
indicate
that
the
disparity
could
not
have
been
very
great
and
therefore
that
after
the
arrival
of
our
reënforcements
our
troops
must
have
become
numerically
superior
the
dead
and
wounded
left
by
the
enemy
upon
the
field
the
arms
ammunition
and
military
stores
abandoned
in
his
flight
so
incontestably
prove
his
defeat
that
his
claim
to
have
achieved
a
victory
is
too
preposterous
for
discussion
though
the
forces
engaged
were
comparatively
small
to
those
in
subsequent
battles
of
the
war
six
hours
of
incessant
combat
with
repeated
must
place
this
in
the
rank
of
the
most
stubborn
engagements
and
the
victors
must
accord
to
the
vanquished
the
meed
of
having
fought
like
americans
one
of
the
results
of
the
battle
which
is
at
least
significant
is
the
fact
that
general
grant
who
had
superciliously
refused
to
recognize
general
polk
as
one
with
whom
he
could
exchange
prisoners
did
after
the
battle
send
a
flag
of
truce
to
get
such
privileges
as
are
recognized
between
armies
acknowledging
each
other
to
be
foemen
worthy
of
their
steel
general
polk
reported
as
follows
we
pursued
them
to
their
boats
seven
miles
and
then
drove
their
boats
before
us
the
road
was
strewed
with
their
dead
and
wounded
guns
ammunition
and
equipments
the
number
of
prisoners
taken
by
the
enemy
as
shown
by
their
list
furnished
was
one
hundred
and
six
all
of
whom
have
been
returned
by
exchange
after
making
a
liberal
allowance
to
the
enemy
a
hundred
of
their
prisoners
still
remain
in
my
hands
one
stand
of
colors
and
a
fraction
over
one
thousand
stand
of
arms
with
knapsacks
ammunition
and
other
military
stores
our
loss
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
was
six
hundred
and
forty
one
that
of
the
enemy
was
probably
not
less
than
twelve
hundred
meanwhile
albert
sidney
johnston
a
soldier
of
great
distinction
in
the
united
states
army
where
he
had
attained
the
rank
of
by
brevet
and
was
in
command
of
the
department
of
california
resigned
his
commission
and
came
overland
from
san
francisco
to
richmond
to
tender
his
services
to
the
confederate
states
though
he
had
been
bred
a
soldier
and
most
of
his
life
had
been
spent
in
the
army
he
had
not
neglected
such
study
of
political
affairs
as
properly
belongs
to
the
citizen
of
a
republic
and
appreciated
the
issue
made
between
states
claiming
the
right
to
resume
the
powers
they
had
delegated
to
a
general
agent
and
the
claims
set
up
by
that
agent
to
coerce
states
his
creators
and
for
whom
he
held
a
trust
he
was
a
native
of
kentucky
but
his
first
military
appointment
was
from
louisiana
and
he
was
a
volunteer
in
the
war
for
independence
by
texas
and
for
a
time
resided
in
that
state
much
of
his
military
service
had
been
in
the
west
and
he
felt
most
identified
with
it
on
the
of
september
he
was
assigned
to
command
our
department
of
the
west
which
included
the
states
of
tennessee
missouri
arkansas
the
indian
country
and
the
western
part
of
mississippi
general
johnston
on
his
arrival
at
nashville
found
that
he
lacked
not
only
men
but
the
munitions
of
war
and
the
means
of
obtaining
them
men
were
ready
to
be
enlisted
but
the
arms
and
equipments
had
nearly
all
been
required
to
fit
out
the
first
levies
immediately
on
his
survey
of
the
situation
he
determined
to
occupy
bowling
green
in
kentucky
and
ordered
buckner
with
five
thousand
men
to
take
possession
of
the
position
this
invasion
of
kentucky
was
an
act
of
rendered
necessary
by
the
action
of
the
government
of
kentucky
and
by
the
evidences
of
intended
movements
of
the
forces
of
the
united
states
it
was
not
possible
to
withdraw
the
troops
from
columbus
in
the
west
nor
from
cumberland
ford
in
the
east
to
which
general
felix
zollicoffer
had
advanced
with
four
thousand
men
a
compliance
with
the
demands
of
kentucky
would
have
opened
the
frontiers
of
tennessee
and
the
mississippi
river
to
the
enemy
besides
it
was
essential
to
the
defense
of
tennessee
east
of
columbus
fort
henry
fort
donelson
and
hopkinsville
were
garrisoned
with
small
bodies
of
troops
and
the
territory
between
columbus
and
bowling
green
was
occupied
by
moving
detachments
which
caused
the
supposition
that
a
large
military
force
was
present
and
contemplated
an
advance
a
fortified
camp
was
established
at
cumberland
gap
as
the
right
of
general
johnston
line
and
an
important
point
for
the
protection
of
east
tennessee
against
invasion
thus
general
johnston
located
his
line
of
defense
from
columbus
on
the
west
to
the
cumberland
mountains
on
the
east
with
his
center
at
bowling
green
which
was
occupied
and
intrenched
it
was
a
good
base
for
military
operations
was
a
proper
depot
for
supplies
and
if
fortified
could
be
held
against
largely
superior
numbers
on
october
general
johnston
took
command
at
bowling
green
he
states
his
force
to
have
been
twelve
thousand
men
and
that
the
force
at
that
time
was
estimated
to
be
double
his
own
or
thousand
he
says
the
enemy
force
increased
more
rapidly
than
our
own
so
that
by
the
last
of
november
it
numbered
fifty
thousand
and
continued
to
increase
until
it
ran
up
to
between
and
one
hundred
thousand
my
force
was
kept
down
by
disease
so
that
it
numbered
about
thousand
the
chief
anxiety
of
the
commander
of
the
department
was
to
procure
arms
and
men
on
the
next
day
after
his
arrival
at
nashville
he
wrote
to
the
governor
of
alabama
i
shall
beg
to
rely
on
your
excellency
to
furnish
us
as
rapidly
as
possible
at
this
point
with
every
arm
it
may
be
in
your
power
to
provide
i
mean
for
infantry
and
cavalry
the
governor
replied
it
is
out
of
the
power
of
alabama
to
afford
you
any
assistance
in
the
way
of
arms
the
governor
of
georgia
replied
to
the
same
request
on
september
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
comply
with
your
request
general
bragg
in
command
at
pensacola
writes
in
reply
on
september
the
mission
of
colonel
buckner
will
not
be
successful
i
fear
as
our
extreme
southern
country
has
been
stripped
of
both
arms
and
men
we
started
early
in
this
matter
and
have
wellnigh
exhausted
our
resources
on
september
general
johnston
telegraphed
to
me
thirty
thousand
stand
of
arms
are
a
necessity
to
my
command
i
beg
you
to
order
them
or
as
many
as
can
be
got
to
be
instantly
procured
and
sent
with
dispatch
the
secretary
of
war
replied
the
whole
number
received
by
us
by
that
steamer
was
eighteen
hundred
and
we
purchased
of
the
owners
seventeen
hundred
and
eighty
making
in
all
hundred
enfield
rifles
of
which
we
have
been
compelled
to
allow
the
governor
of
georgia
to
have
one
thousand
for
arming
troops
to
repel
an
attack
now
hourly
threatened
at
brunswick
of
the
remaining
hundred
i
have
ordered
one
thousand
sent
to
you
leaving
us
but
fifteen
hundred
for
arming
several
regiments
now
encamped
here
and
who
have
been
awaiting
their
arms
for
several
months
we
have
not
an
engineer
to
send
you
the
whole
engineer
corps
comprises
only
six
captains
together
with
three
majors
of
whom
one
is
on
bureau
duty
you
will
be
compelled
to
employ
the
best
material
within
your
reach
by
detailing
officers
from
other
corps
and
by
employing
civil
engineers
these
details
are
given
to
serve
as
an
illustration
of
the
deficiencies
existing
in
every
department
of
the
military
service
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
in
this
respect
much
relief
came
from
the
efforts
of
governor
harris
and
the
legislature
of
tennessee
a
and
workshops
were
established
the
at
nashville
turned
out
about
pounds
a
day
twelve
or
fourteen
batteries
were
fitted
out
at
memphis
laws
were
passed
to
impress
and
pay
for
the
private
arms
scattered
throughout
the
state
and
the
utmost
efforts
were
made
to
collect
and
adapt
them
to
military
uses
the
returns
make
it
evident
that
during
most
of
the
autumn
of
fully
one
half
of
general
johnston
troops
were
imperfectly
armed
and
whole
brigades
remained
without
weapons
for
months
no
less
energetic
were
the
measures
taken
to
concentrate
and
recruit
his
forces
general
hardee
command
was
moved
from
northeastern
arkansas
and
sent
to
bowling
green
which
added
four
thousand
men
to
the
troops
there
the
regiment
of
texan
rangers
was
brought
from
louisiana
and
supplied
with
horses
and
sent
to
the
front
five
hundred
kentuckians
joined
general
buckner
on
his
advance
and
five
regiments
were
gradually
formed
and
filled
up
a
cavalry
company
under
john
morgan
was
also
added
at
this
time
september
general
johnston
under
the
authority
granted
to
him
by
the
government
made
a
requisition
for
thirty
thousand
men
from
tennessee
ten
thousand
from
mississippi
and
ten
thousand
from
arkansas
the
arkansas
troops
were
directed
to
be
sent
to
general
mcculloch
for
the
defense
of
their
own
frontier
the
governor
of
mississippi
sent
four
regiments
when
this
source
of
supply
was
closed
up
to
the
middle
of
november
only
three
regiments
were
mustered
in
under
this
call
from
tennessee
but
by
the
close
of
december
the
number
of
men
who
joined
was
from
twelve
to
fifteen
thousand
two
regiments
fifteen
hundred
strong
had
joined
general
polk
in
arkansas
five
companies
and
a
battalion
had
been
organized
and
were
ready
to
join
general
mcculloch
a
speedy
advance
of
the
enemy
was
now
indicated
and
an
increase
of
force
was
so
necessary
that
further
delay
was
impossible
general
johnston
therefore
determined
upon
a
levy
in
his
department
he
made
a
requisition
on
the
governors
of
tennessee
alabama
and
mississippi
to
call
out
every
member
of
the
militia
into
whose
hands
arms
could
be
placed
or
to
provide
a
volunteer
force
large
enough
to
use
all
the
arms
that
could
be
procured
in
his
letters
to
these
governors
he
plainly
presents
his
view
of
the
posture
of
affairs
on
december
points
out
impending
dangers
and
shows
that
to
his
applications
the
response
had
not
been
such
as
the
emergency
demanded
he
says
it
was
apprehended
by
me
that
the
enemy
would
attempt
to
assail
the
south
not
only
by
boats
and
troops
moving
down
the
river
to
be
assembled
during
the
fall
and
winter
but
by
columns
marching
inland
threatening
tennessee
by
endeavoring
to
turn
the
defenses
of
columbus
further
observation
confirms
me
in
this
opinion
but
i
think
the
means
employed
for
the
defense
of
the
river
will
probably
render
it
comparatively
secure
the
enemy
will
energetically
push
toward
nashville
the
heavy
masses
of
troops
now
assembled
between
louisville
and
bowling
green
the
general
position
of
bowling
green
is
good
and
commanding
but
the
peculiar
topography
of
the
place
and
the
length
of
the
line
of
the
barren
river
as
a
line
of
defense
though
strong
require
a
large
force
to
defend
it
there
is
no
position
equally
defensive
as
bowling
green
nor
line
of
defense
as
good
as
the
barren
river
between
the
barren
and
the
cumberland
at
nashville
so
that
it
can
not
be
abandoned
without
exposing
tennessee
and
giving
vastly
the
to
the
enemy
it
is
manifest
that
the
northern
generals
appreciate
this
and
by
withdrawing
their
forces
from
western
virginia
and
east
kentucky
they
have
managed
to
add
them
to
the
new
levies
from
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
and
to
concentrate
a
force
in
front
of
me
variously
estimated
at
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
which
i
believe
will
number
thousand
to
maintain
my
position
i
have
only
about
seventeen
thousand
men
in
this
neighborhood
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
obtain
additions
to
my
strength
from
columbus
the
generals
in
command
in
that
quarter
consider
that
it
would
imperil
that
point
to
diminish
their
force
and
open
tennessee
to
the
enemy
general
zollicoffer
can
not
join
me
as
he
guards
the
cumberland
and
prevents
the
invasion
and
possible
revolt
of
east
tennessee
on
june
general
johnston
was
reënforced
by
the
brigades
of
floyd
and
maney
from
western
virginia
he
also
sent
a
messenger
to
richmond
to
ask
that
a
few
regiments
might
be
detached
from
the
several
armies
in
the
field
and
sent
to
him
to
be
replaced
by
new
levies
he
said
i
do
not
ask
that
my
force
shall
be
made
equal
to
that
of
the
enemy
but
if
possible
it
should
be
raised
to
fifty
thousand
men
meantime
such
an
appearance
of
menace
had
been
maintained
as
led
the
enemy
to
believe
that
our
force
was
large
and
that
he
might
be
attacked
at
any
time
frequent
and
rapid
expeditions
through
the
sparsely

when
forming
the
constitution
to
delegate
to
the
federal
government
power
to
coerce
a
state
by
its
last
clause
it
was
provided
that
not
even
to
suppress
domestic
violence
could
the
general
government
on
its
own
motion
send
troops
of
the
united
states
into
the
territory
of
one
of
the
states
that
section
reads
thus
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
of
government
and
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
invasion
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
of
the
executive
when
the
legislature
can
not
be
convened
against
domestic
violence
surely
if
federal
troops
could
not
be
sent
into
a
state
without
its
application
even
to
protect
it
against
domestic
violence
still
less
could
it
be
done
to
overrule
the
will
of
its
people
that
instead
of
an
obligation
upon
the
citizens
of
other
states
to
respond
to
a
call
by
the
president
for
troops
to
invade
a
particular
state
it
was
in
april
deemed
a
high
crime
to
so
use
them
reference
is
here
made
to
the
published
answers
of
the
governors
of
states
which
had
not
seceded
to
the
requisition
made
upon
them
for
troops
to
be
employed
against
the
states
which
had
seceded
governor
letcher
of
virginia
replied
to
the
requisition
of
the
united
states
secretary
of
war
as
follows
i
am
requested
to
detach
from
the
militia
of
the
state
of
virginia
the
quota
designated
in
a
table
which
you
append
to
serve
as
infantry
or
riflemen
for
the
period
of
three
months
unless
sooner
discharged
in
reply
to
this
communication
i
have
only
to
say
that
the
militia
of
virginia
will
not
be
furnished
to
the
powers
at
washington
for
any
such
use
or
purpose
as
they
have
in
view
your
object
is
to
subjugate
the
southern
states
and
a
requisition
made
upon
me
for
such
an
object
an
object
in
my
judgment
not
within
the
purview
of
the
constitution
or
the
act
of
will
not
be
complied
with
governor
magoffin
of
kentucky
replied
your
dispatch
is
received
in
answer
i
say
emphatically
kentucky
will
furnish
no
troops
for
the
wicked
purpose
of
subduing
her
sister
southern
states
governor
harris
of
tennessee
replied
tennessee
will
not
furnish
a
single
man
for
coercion
but
fifty
thousand
if
necessary
for
the
defense
of
our
rights
or
those
of
our
southern
brothers
governor
jackson
of
missouri
answered
requisition
is
illegal
unconstitutional
revolutionary
inhuman
diabolical
and
can
not
be
complied
with
governor
rector
of
arkansas
replied
in
answer
to
your
requisition
for
troops
from
arkansas
to
subjugate
the
southern
states
i
have
to
say
that
none
will
be
furnished
the
demand
is
only
adding
insult
to
injury
governor
ellis
of
north
carolina
responded
to
the
requisition
for
troops
from
that
state
as
follows
your
dispatch
is
received
and
if
genuine
which
its
extraordinary
character
leads
me
to
doubt
i
have
to
say
in
reply
that
i
regard
the
levy
of
troops
made
by
the
administration
for
the
purpose
of
subjugating
the
states
of
the
south
as
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
a
usurpation
of
power
i
can
be
no
party
to
this
wicked
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
country
and
to
this
war
upon
the
liberties
of
a
free
people
you
can
get
no
troops
from
north
carolina
governor
ellis
who
had
lived
long
enough
to
leave
behind
him
an
enviable
reputation
was
a
fair
representative
of
the
conservatism
gallantry
and
tenacity
in
of
the
state
over
which
he
presided
he
died
too
soon
for
his
country
good
and
the
confederacy
seriously
felt
the
loss
of
his
valuable
services
the
prompt
and
spirited
answer
he
gave
to
the
call
upon
north
carolina
to
furnish
troops
for
the
subjugation
of
the
southern
states
was
the
fitting
complement
of
his
earlier
action
in
immediately
restoring
to
the
federal
government
forts
johnson
and
caswell
which
had
been
seized
without
proper
authority
in
communicating
his
action
to
president
buchanan
he
wrote
my
information
satisfies
me
that
this
popular
outbreak
was
caused
by
a
report
very
generally
credited
but
which
for
the
sake
of
humanity
i
hope
is
not
true
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
administration
to
coerce
the
southern
states
and
that
troops
were
on
their
way
to
garrison
the
southern
ports
and
to
begin
the
work
of
subjugation
should
i
receive
assurance
that
no
troops
will
be
sent
to
this
state
prior
to
the
of
march
next
then
all
will
be
peace
and
quiet
here
and
the
property
of
the
united
states
will
be
fully
protected
as
heretofore
if
however
i
am
unable
to
get
such
assurances
i
will
not
undertake
to
answer
for
the
consequences
the
forts
in
this
state
have
long
been
unoccupied
and
their
being
garrisoned
at
this
time
will
unquestionably
be
looked
upon
as
a
hostile
demonstration
and
will
in
my
opinion
certainly
be
resisted
the
plea
so
constantly
made
by
the
succeeding
administration
as
an
excuse
for
its
warlike
acts
that
the
duty
to
protect
the
public
property
required
such
action
is
shown
by
this
letter
of
governor
ellis
to
have
been
a
plea
created
by
their
usurpations
but
for
which
there
might
have
been
peace
as
well
as
safety
to
property
and
what
was
of
greater
worth
the
lives
the
liberties
and
the
republican
institutions
of
the
country
there
was
great
similarity
in
the
condition
of
missouri
to
that
of
kentucky
they
were
both
border
states
and
by
their
institutions
and
the
origin
of
a
large
portion
of
their
citizens
were
identified
with
the
south
both
sought
to
occupy
a
neutral
position
in
the
impending
war
and
offered
guarantees
of
peace
and
order
throughout
their
territory
if
left
free
to
control
their
own
affairs
both
refused
to
furnish
troops
to
the
united
states
government
for
the
unconstitutional
purpose
of
coercing
the
southern
states
both
because
of
their
stronger
affinity
to
the
south
than
to
the
north
were
the
objects
of
suspicion
and
consequent
military
occupation
by
the
troops
of
the
united
states
government
at
the
inception
of
this
unwarrantable
proceeding
an
effort
was
made
by
the
governor
of
missouri
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
state
without
disturbing
its
relations
to
the
united
states
government
if
it
had
been
the
policy
of
the
government
to
allow
to
missouri
the
control
of
her
domestic
affairs
and
an
exemption
from
being
a
party
to
the
violation
of
the
constitution
in
making
war
against
certain
of
the
states
the
effort
of
the
governor
might
and
probably
would
have
been
successful
the
form
and
purpose
of
that
effort
appear
in
the
compact
entered
into
between
price
commanding
the
militia
or
missouri
state
guard
and
general
harney
of
the
united
states
army
commanding
the
department
of
the
west
a
geographical
division
which
included
the
state
of
missouri
during
a
temporary
absence
of
general
harney
captain
lyon
commanding
united
states
forces
at
louis
initiated
hostilities
against
the
state
of
missouri
under
the
following
circumstances
in
obedience
to
the
militia
law
of
the
state
an
annual
encampment
was
directed
by
the
governor
for
instruction
in
tactics
camp
jackson
near
louis
was
designated
for
the
encampment
of
the
militia
of
the
county
in
here
for
some
days
companies
of
state
militia
amounting
to
about
eight
hundred
men
under
command
of
frost
were
being
exercised
as
is
usual
upon
such
occasions
they
presented
no
appearance
of
a
hostile
camp
there
were
no
sentinels
to
guard
against
surprise
visitors
were
freely
admitted
it
was
the
for
the
ladies
of
the
city
and
everything
wore
the
aspect
of
rather
than
that
of
war
suddenly
captain
afterward
general
nathaniel
lyon
appeared
with
an
overwhelming
force
of
federal
troops
surrounded
this
holiday
encampment
and
demanded
an
unconditional
surrender
resistance
was
impracticable
and
none
was
attempted
the
militia
surrendered
and
were
confined
as
prisoners
but
prisoners
of
what
there
was
no
war
and
no
warrant
for
their
arrest
as
offenders
against
the
law
it
is
left
for
the
usurpers
to
frame
a
vocabulary
suited
to
their
act
after
the
return
of
general
harney
frost
of
the
missouri
militia
appealed
to
him
from
his
prison
the
louis
arsenal
on
may
representing
that
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri
which
have
been
existing
for
some
years
and
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
the
governor
on
monday
last
i
entered
into
an
encampment
with
the
militia
force
of
louis
county
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
same
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
he
further
sets
forth
that
every
officer
and
soldier
of
his
command
had
taken
an
oath
to
sustain
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
missouri
and
that
while
in
the
peaceable
performance
of
their
duties
the
encampment
was
surrounded
by
the
command
of
captain
lyon
united
states
army
and
a
surrender
demanded
to
which
general
frost
replied
as
follows
camp
jackson
sir
i
never
for
a
moment
having
conceived
the
idea
that
so
illegal
and
unconstitutional
a
demand
as
i
have
just
received
from
you
would
be
made
by
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
am
wholly
unprepared
to
defend
my
command
from
this
unwarranted
attack
and
shall
therefore
be
forced
to
comply
with
your
demand

my
command
was
in
accordance
with
the
above
deprived
of
their
arms
and
surrendered
into
the
hands
of
captain
lyon
after
which
while
thus
disarmed
and
surrounded
a
fire
was
opened
on
a
portion
of
it
by
his
troops
and
a
number
of
my
men
put
to
death
together
with
several
innocent
men
women
and
children
on
the
occasion
of
the
attack
upon
camp
jackson
a
large
crowd
of
citizens
men
women
and
children
were
gathered
around
gazing
curiously
at
these
strange
proceedings
when
a
volley
was
fired
into
them
killing
ten
and
wounding
twenty
mostly
women
and
children
a
reign
of
terror
was
at
once
established
and
the
most
severe
measures
were
adopted
by
the
federals
to
overawe
the
excitement
and
the
rage
of
the
people
the
massacre
at
camp
jackson
produced
intense
excitement
throughout
the
state
the
legislature
upon
receipt
of
the
news
passed
several
bills
for
the
enrollment
and
organization
of
the
militia
and
to
confer
special
powers
upon
the
governor
of
the
state
by
virtue
of
these
general
officers

appointed
chief
of
whom
was
sterling

because
of
the
atrocities
at
louis
and
the
violent
demonstrations
consequent
upon
them
not
only
in
louis
but
elsewhere
in
the
state
general
price
well
known
to
be
what
was
termed
a
union
man
and
not
only
by
his
commission
as
of
the
militia
of
the
state
but
also
and
even
more
because
of
his
influence
among
the
people
was
earnestly
solicited
by
influential
citizens
of
louis
to
unite
with
general
harney
in
a
joint
effort
to
restore
order
and
preserve
peace
with
the
sanction
of
governor
jackson
he
proceeded
to
louis
the
headquarters
of
the
department
of
the
west
and
after
some
preliminary
conference
entered
into
the
following
agreement
which
being
promulgated
to
the
people
was
received
with
general
satisfaction
and
for
a
time
allayed
excitement
the
agreement
was
as
follows
louis
the
undersigned
officers
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
missouri
for
the
purpose
of
removing
misapprehension
and
of
allaying
public
excitement
deem
it
proper
to
declare
publicly
that
they
have
this
day
had
a
personal
interview
in
this
city
in
which
it
has
been
mutually
understood
without
the
semblance
of
dissent
on
either
part
that
each
of
them
has
no
other
than
a
common
object
equally
interesting
and
important
to
every
citizen
of
missouri
that
of
restoring
peace
and
good
order
to
the
people
of
the
state
in
subordination
to
the
laws
of
the
general
and
state
governments
it
being
thus
understood
there
seems
no
reason
why
every
citizen
should
not
confide
in
the
proper
officers
of
the
general
and
state
governments
to
restore
quiet
and
as
among
the
best
means
of
offering
no
we
mutually
commend
to
all
persons
to
respect
each
other
rights
throughout
the
state
making
no
attempt
to
exercise
unauthorized
powers
as
it
is
the
determination
of
the
proper
authorities
to
suppress
all
unlawful
proceedings
which
can
only
disturb
the
public
peace
general
price
having
by
commission
full
authority
over
the
militia
of
the
state
of
missouri
undertakes
with
the
sanction
of
the
governor
of
the
state
already
declared
to
direct
the
whole
power
of
the
state
officers
to
maintaining
order
within
the
state
among
the
people
thereof
general
harney
publicly
declares
that
this
object
being
assured
he
can
have
no
occasion
as
he
has
no
wish
to
make
military
movements
that
might
otherwise
create
excitement
and
jealousy
which
he
most
earnestly
desires
to
avoid
we
the
undersigned
do
therefore
mutually
enjoin
upon
the
people
of
the
state
to
attend
to
their
civil
business
of
whatever
sort
it
may
be
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
unquiet
elements
which
have
threatened
so
seriously
to
disturb
the
public
peace
may
soon
subside
and
be
remembered
only
to
be
deplored
harney
sterling
price
missouri
state
the
distinct
position
of
general
harney
that
the
military
force
of
the
united
states
should
not
be
used
in
missouri
except
in
case
of
necessity
together
with
the
emphatic
declaration
of
general
price
that
he
had
the
power
and
would
use
it
to
preserve
peace
and
order
in
missouri
seemed
to
remove
all
danger
of
collision
in
that
state
between
the
federal
and
local
forces
in
conformity
with
this
understanding
general
price
returned
to
the
capital
of
the
state
and
sent
to
their
homes
the
militia
who
had
been
assembled
there
by
the
governor
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
against
an
anticipated
attack
by
the
troops
of
the
united
states
those
who
desired
to
preserve
peace
in
missouri
had
just
cause
to
be
gratified
at
the
favorable
prospect
now
presented
those
who
desired
war
had
equal
ground
for
dissatisfaction
a
few
days
after
the
promulgation
of
the
agreement
between
general
price
and
general
harney
the
latter
was
removed
from
command
as
many
believed
because
of
his
successful
efforts
to
allay
excitement
and
avoid
war
rumors
had
been
in
circulation
that
the
missourians
were
driving
the
union
men
from
their
homes
and
many
letters
purporting
to
be
written
in
different
parts
of
the
state
represented
the
persecution
of
union
men
it
was
suspected
that
many
of
them
were
written
in
louis
or
inspired
by
the
cabal
an
incident
related
in
confirmation
of
the
justice
of
this
suspicion
is
that
general
harney
received
a
letter
from
joseph
stating
that
stewart
and
a
number
of
the
most
respectable
men
in
joseph
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
and
that
unless
soldiers
were
soon
sent
the
union
men
would
all
have
to
leave
he
called
upon
the
hon
blair
an
influential
citizen
of
louis
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
the
writer
of
the
letter
the
reply
was
oh
yes
he
is
perfectly
reliable
you
can
believe
anything
he
says
general
harney
said
he
would
write
immediately
to
general
price
dissatisfaction
was
then
manifested
at
such
delay
but
two
or
three
days
later
a
letter
from
stewart
was
published
in
the
joseph
news
in
which
was
a
marked
paragraph
of
the
copy
sent
to
general
harney
neither
i
nor
any
other
union
man
has
been
driven
out
of
st
joe
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
evade
the
conclusion
that
general
harney
was
relieved
from
command
because
of
his
pacific
policy
the
argument
is
that
the
order
was
dated
the
of
may
and
his
agreement
with
general
price
was
on
the
of
the
same
month
an
argument
more
specious
than
fair
as
it
appears
from
the
letter
of
president
lincoln
of
may
to
hon
blair
that
the
order
sent
from
the
war
department
to
him
was
to
be
delivered
or
withheld
at
his
discretion
and
that
it
was
not
delivered
until
the
of
the
month
and
until
after
general
harney
had
not
only
entered
into
his
agreement
with
general
price
but
had
declined
to
act
upon
sensational
stories
of
persecution
on
which
applications
were
made
to
send
troops
into
the
interior
of
missouri
during
the
days
this
order
was
held
for
his
removal
with
discretionary
power
to
deliver
or
withhold
it
the
events
occurred
and
they
may
fairly
be
considered
as
having
decided
the
question
of
his
removal
from
that
command
the
principal
united
states
arsenal
at
the
west
was
that
near
to
louis
to
it
had
been
transferred
a
large
number
of
the
altered
muskets
sent
from
springfield
massachusetts
so
that
in
the
arms
in
that
arsenal
were
perhaps
numerically
second
only
to
those
at
springfield
these
arms
by
a
conjunction
of
deceptive
and
bold
measures
were
removed
from
the
arsenal
in
missouri
and
transported
to
illinois
to
whom
did
those
arms
belong
certainly
to
those
whose
money
had
made
or
purchased
them
that
is
to
the
states
in
common
not
to
their
agent
the
general
government
or
to
a
portion
of
the
states
which
might
be
in
a
condition
to
appropriate
them
to
their
special
use
and
in
disregard
of
the
rights
of
their
partners
not
satisfied
with
removing
the
public
arms
from
the
limits
of
missouri
the
next
step
was
that
in
total
disrespect
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
citizens
to
bear
arms
for
their
own
defense
and
to
be
free
from
searches
and
seizures
except
by
warrants
duly
issued
the
officers
of
the
general
government
proceeded
to
search
the
houses
of
citizens
in
louis
and
to
seize
arms
wherever
they
were
found
missouri
had
refused
to
engage
in
war
against
her
sister
states
of
the
south
therefore
she
was
first
to
be
disarmed
and
then
to
be
made
the
victim
of
an
invasion
characterized
by
such
barbarous
atrocities
as
shame
the
civilization
of
the
age
the
wrongs
she
suffered
the
brave
efforts
of
her
unarmed
people
to
defend
their
hearthstones
and
their
liberties
against
the
desecration
and
destruction
of
both
form
a
melancholy
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
which
all
who
would
cherish
their
fair
fame
must
wish
could
be
obliterated
these
acts
of
usurpation
and
outrage
as
well
upon
the
political
as
personal
rights
of
the
people
of
missouri
aroused
an
intense
feeling
in
that
state
it
will
be
remembered
that
governor
jackson
had
responded
to
the
call
of
lincoln
upon
him
for
troops
with
the
just
indignation
of
one
who
understood
the
rights
of
the
state
and
the
limited
powers
of
the
general
government
his
stern
refusal
to
become
a
party
to
the
war
upon
the
south
made
him
the
object
of
special
persecution
by
his
side
in
this
critical
juncture
stood
the
gallant
veteran
general
price
to
the
latter
was
confided
the
conduct
of
the
military
affairs
of
the
state
and
after
exhausting
every
effort
to
maintain
order
by
peaceful
means
and
seeing
that
the
government
would
recognize
no
other
method
than
that
of
force
he
energetically
applied
himself
to
raise
troops
and
procure
arms
so
as
to
enable
the
state
to
meet
force
by
force
during
this
and
all
the
subsequent
period
the
governor
and
the
general
were
ably
seconded
by
the
accomplished
gallant
and
indefatigable
reynolds
the
position
of
missouri
in
was
unquestionably
that
of
opposition
to
the
secession
of
the
state
the
people
generously
confided
in
the
disposition
of
the
general
government
to
observe
their
rights
and
continued
to
hope
for
a
peaceful
settlement
of
the
questions
then
agitating
the
country
this
was
evinced
by
the
fact
that
not
a
single
secessionist
was
elected
to
the
state
convention
and
that
general
price
an
avowed
union
man
was
chosen
as
president
of
the
convention
hence
the
general
satisfaction
with
the
agreement
made
between
generals
harney
and
price
for
the
preservation
of
peace
and
by
the
army
of
the
united
states
general
harney
the
day
before
the
order
for
his
removal
was
communicated
to
him
wrote
to
the
war
department
expressing
his
confidence
in
the
preservation
of
peace
in
missouri
and
used
this
significant
expression
interference
by
unauthorized
parties
as
to
the
course
i
shall
pursue
can
alone
prevent
the
realization
of
these
hopes
the
unauthorized
parties
here
referred
to
could
not
have
been
the
people
or
the
government
of
missouri
others
than
they
must
have
been
the
parties
wishing
to
use
force
provocative
of
hostilities
as
has
been
heretofore
stated
after
his
agreement
with
general
harney
at
louis
general
price
returned
to
the
capital
and
dismissed
to
their
homes
the
large
body
of
militia
that
had
been
there
assembled
after
the
removal
of
general
harney
believed
to
be
in
consequence
of
his
determination
to
avoid
the
use
of
military
force
against
the
people
of
missouri
reports
were
rife
of
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
administration
at
washington
to
disarm
the
citizens
of
missouri
who
did
not
sympathize
with
the
views
of
the
federal
government
and
to
put
arms
into
the
hands
of
those
who
could
be
relied
on
to
enforce
them
on
the
of
june
general
price
issued
an
address
to
the
people
of
missouri
and
in
reference
to
that
report
said
the
purpose
of
such
a
movement
could
not
be
misunderstood
and
it
would
not
only
be
a
palpable
violation
of
the
agreement
referred
to
and
an
equally
plain
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights
but
a
gross
indignity
to
the
citizens
of
this
state
which
would
be
resisted
to
the
last
extremity
the
call
of
president
lincoln
for
thousand
volunteers
removed
any
preëxisting
doubt
as
to
the
intent
to
coerce
the
states
which
should
claim
to
assert
their
right
of
sovereignty
missouri
while
avowing
her
purpose
to
adhere
to
the
union
had
asserted
her
right
to
exercise
supreme
control
over
her
domestic
affairs
and
this
put
her
in
the
category
of
a
state
threatened
by
the
proceedings
of
the
united
states
government
to
provide
for
such
contingency
as
might
be
anticipated
governor
jackson
on
the
of
june
issued
a
call
for
fifty
thousand
volunteers
and
price
took
the
field
in
command
in
this
proclamation
governor
jackson
said
a
series
of
unprovoked
and
unparalleled
outrages
has
been
inflicted
on
the
peace
and
dignity
of
this
commonwealth
and
upon
the
rights
and
liberties
of
its
people
by
wicked
and
unprincipled
men
professing
to
act
under
the
authority
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
his
endeavor
to
maintain
the
peace
of
the
state
and
to
avert
if
possible
from
its
borders
a
civil
war
he
caused
the
aforementioned
agreement
to
be
made
with
the
commander
of
the
northern
forces
in
the
state
by
which
its
peace
might
be
preserved
that
officer
was
promptly
removed
by
his
government
the
governor
then
upon
the
increase
of
hostile
actions
proposed
at
an
interview
with
the
new
officer
commanding
the
forces
of
the
united
states
government
to
disband
the
state
guard
and
break
up
its
organization
to
disarm
all
companies
that
had
been
armed
by
the
state
to
pledge
himself
not
to
organize
the
militia
under
the
military
bill
that
no
arms
or
munitions
of
war
should
be
brought
into
the
state
that
he
would
protect
the
citizens
equally
in
all
their
rights
regardless
of
their
political
opinions
that
he
would
repress
all
insurrectionary
movements
within
the
state
would
repel
all
attempts
to
invade
it
from
whatever
quarter
and
by
whomsoever
made
and
would
maintain
a
strict
neutrality
and
preserve
the
peace
of
the
state
and
further
if
necessary
he
would
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
united
states
troops
to
carry
out
the
pledges
the
only
conditions
to
this
proposition
made
by
the
governor
were
that
the
united
states
government
should
undertake
to
disarm
the
home
guard
which
it
had
illegally
organized
and
armed
throughout
the
state
and
pledge
itself
not
to
occupy
with
its
troops
any
localities
in
the
state
not
occupied
by
them
at
that
time
the
words
of
a
governor
of
a
state
who
offered
such
truly
generous
terms
deserve
to
be
inserted
nothing
but
the
most
earnest
desire
to
avert
the
horrors
of
civil
war
from
our
beloved
state
could
have
tempted
me
to
propose
these
humiliating
terms
they
were
rejected
by
the
federal
officers
these
demanded
not
only
the
disorganization
and
disarming
of
the
state
militia
and
the
nullification
of
the
military
bill
but
they
refused
to
disarm
their
own
home
guard
and
insisted
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
enjoy
an
unrestricted
right
to
move
and
station
its
troops
throughout
the
state
whenever
and
wherever
it
might
in
the
opinion
of
its
officers
be
necessary
either
for
the
protection
of
its
loyal
subjects
or
for
the
repelling
of
invasion
and
they
plainly
announced
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
administration
to
take
military
occupation
of
the
whole
state
and
to
reduce
it
as
avowed
by
general
lyon
to
the
exact
condition
of
maryland
we
have
already
stated
that
the
revolutionary
measures
which
the
united
states
government
had
undertaken
to
enforce
involved
the
subjection
of
every
state
either
by
voluntary
submission
or
subjugation
however
much
a
state
might
desire
peace
and
neutrality
its
own
will
could
not
elect
the
scheme
demanded
the
absolute
sovereignty
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
in
other
words
the
extinguishment
of
the
independence
and
sovereignty
of
the
state
human
actions
are
not
only
the
fruit
of
the
ruling
motive
but
they
are
also
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
that
motive
thus
when
we
see
the
governor
of
the
state
of
missouri
offering
such
generous
terms
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
preserve
peace
and
neutrality
and
the
latter
rejecting
them
avow
its
intention
to
do
its
will
with
the
authorities
the
property
and
the
citizens
of
the
state
and
proceed
with
military
force
to
do
it
its
actions
are
both
the
evidence
and
the
fruit
of
its
theory
these
measures
were
revolutionary
in
the
extreme
they
involved
the
entire
subversion
of
those
principles
on
which
the
american
union
was
founded
and
of
the
compact
or
constitution
of
that
union
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
hands
of
those
who
wielded
its
authority
was
made
the
bloody
instrument
to
establish
these
usurpations
on
the
ruins
of
the
crushed
hopes
of
mankind
for
permanent
freedom
under
constitutional
government
for
the
justness
and
truthfulness
of
these
allegations
i
appeal
to
the
impartial
and
sober
judgment
of
posterity
the
volunteers
who
were
assembled
under
this
proclamation
of
governor
jackson
of
june
had
few
arms
except
their
and
and
could
scarcely
be
said
to
have
any
military
equipments
the
who
were
appointed
were
assigned
to
geographical
divisions
and
with
such
men
as
they
could
collect
reported
in
obedience
to
their
orders
at
booneville
and
lexington
on
the
of
june
general
lyon
and
colonel
blair
with
an
estimated
force
of
seven
thousand
troops
having
eight
pieces
of
artillery
ascended
the
missouri
river
and
debarked
about
five
miles
below
booneville
to
oppose
them
the
missourians
had
there
about
eight
hundred
men
poorly
armed
without
a
piece
of
artillery
and
but
little
ammunition
with
courage
which
must
be
commended
at
the
expense
of
their
discretion
they
resolved
to
engage
the
enemy
and
after
a
combat
of
an
hour
and
a
half
or
more
retired
having
inflicted
heavy
loss
upon
the
enemy
and
suffering
but
little
themselves
this
first
skirmish
between
the
federal
troops
and
the
missouri
militia
inspired
confidence
in
their
and
checked
the
contemptuous
terms
in
which
the
militia
had
been
spoken
of
by
the
enemy
governor
jackson
with
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
to
three
hundred
of
the
militia
engaged
in
the
action
at
booneville
started
toward
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
state
he
marched
in
the
direction
of
a
place
called
cole
camp
and
when
within
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
of
it
learned
that
a
force
of
seven
hundred
to
one
thousand
of
the
enemy
had
been
sent
to
that
point
by
general
lyon
and
colonel
blair
with
the
view
of
intercepting
his
retreat
the
design
however
was
frustrated
by
an
expedition
consisting
of
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
commanded
by
colonel
who
had
assembled
them
in
a
very
few
hours
in
the
neighborhood
south
of
the
enemy
camp
there
were
no
pickets
out
except
in
the
neighborhood
of
jackson
forces
and
colonel
surprised
the
enemy
where
they
were
asleep
in
two
large
barns
the
attack
was
made
at
daybreak
the
enemy
routed
after
suffering
the
heavy
loss
of
two
hundred
and
six
killed
and
more
wounded
and
more
than
a
hundred
prisoners
three
hundred
and
muskets
with
bayonets
were
captured
the
missourians
lost
four
killed
and
fifteen
or
twenty
wounded
general
price
with
a
view
to
draw
his
army
from
the
baseline
of
the
enemy
the
missouri
river
ordered
his
troops
to
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
state
the
column
from
lexington
marched
without
transportation
without
tents
or
blankets
and
relied
for
subsistence
on
the
country
through
which
it
passed
being
in
the
mean
time
closely
pursued
by
the
enemy
the
movement
was
successfully
made
and
a
junction
effected
in
cedar
county
with
the
forces
present
with
governor
jackson
the
total
when
assembled
was
about
hundred
men
this
then
was
the
patriot
army
of
missouri
it
was
a
heterogeneous
mass
representing
every
condition
of
western
life
there
were
the
old
and
young
the
rich
and
poor
the
grave
and
gay
the
planter
and
laborer
the
farmer
and
clerk
the
hunter
and
boatman
the
merchant
and
woodsman
at
least
five
hundred
of
these
men
were
entirely
unarmed
many
had
only
the
common
rifle
and
none
were
provided
with
cartridges
or
canteens
they
had
eight
pieces
of
cannon
but
no
shells
and
very
few
solid
shot
or
rounds
of
grape
and
canister
rude
and
almost
incredible
devices
were
made
to
supply
these
wants
iron
rods
hard
pebbles
and
smooth
stones
were
substituted
for
shot
and
evidence
of
the
effect
of
such
rough
missiles
was
to
be
given
in
the
next
encounter
with
the
enemy
governor
jackson
continued
his
march
toward
southwestern
missouri
he
had
received
reliable
intelligence
that
he
was
pursued
by
general
lyon
from
the
northeast
and
by
lane
and
sturgis
from
the
northwest
their
supposed
object
being
to
form
a
junction
in
his
rear
and
he
subsequently
learned
that
a
column
numbering
three
thousand
had
been
sent
out
from
louis
to
intercept
his
retreat
and
had
arrived
at
the
town
of
carthage
immediately
in
his
front
these
undisciplined
poorly
armed
missourians
were
therefore
in
a
position
which
would
have
appalled
less
heroic
men
a
large
hostile
force
in
their
rear
and
another
nearly
equal
in
numbers
to
their
own
disputing
their
passage
in
front
they
however
cheerfully
moved
forward
attacked
the
enemy
in
position
and
after
a
severe
engagement
routed
him
pursued
him
to
a
second
position
from
which
he
was
again
driven
falling
back
to
carthage
where
he
made
his
last
stand
and
upon
being
driven
from
which
as
was
subsequently
ascertained
continued
his
retreat
all
night
the
killed
and
wounded
of
the
enemy
left
along
the
route
of
his
retreat
over
a
space
of
ten
miles
were
estimated
at
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
killed
and
from
three
to
four
hundred
wounded
several
hundred
muskets
were
captured
and
the
missourians
were
better
prepared
for
future
conflicts
our
loss
was
between
forty
and
fifty
killed
and
from
one
hundred
and
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
wounded
if
any
shall
ask
why
i
have
entered
into
such
details
of
engagements
where
the
forces
were
comparatively
so
small
and
the
results
so
little
affected
the
final
issue
of
the
war
the
reply
is
that
such
heroism
and
as
these
undisciplined
partially
armed
unequipped
men
displayed
against
superior
numbers
possessed
of
all
the
appliances
of
war
claim
special
notice
as
bearing
evidence
not
only
of
the
virtue
of
the
men
but
the
sanctity
of
the
cause
which
could
so
inspire
them
unsupported
save
by
the
consciousness
of
a
just
cause
without
other
sympathy
than
that
which
the
confederate
states
fully
gave
despising
the
plea
of
helplessness
and
defying
the
threats
of
a
powerful
government
to
crush
her
missouri
without
arms
or
other
military
preparation
took
up
the
gauntlet
thrown
at
her
feet
and
dared
to
make
war
in
defense
of
the
laws
and
liberties
of
her
people
my
motive
for
promptly
removing
the
seat
of
government
after
authority
was
given
by
the
provisional
congress
has
been
heretofore
stated
but
proximity
to
the
main
army
of
the
enemy
and
the
flanking
attacks
by
which
the
new
capital
was
threatened
did
not
diminish
the
anxiety
which
had
been
felt
before
removal
from
montgomery
in
regard
to
affairs
in
missouri
the
far
west
of
the
confederacy
the
state
which
forty
years
before
had
been
admitted
to
the
union
against
sectional
resistance
to
the
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
specifically
denominated
in
the
treaty
for
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
now
because
her
governor
refused
to
furnish
troops
for
the
unconstitutional
purpose
of
coercing
states
became
the
subject
of
special
hostility
and
the
object
of
extraordinary
efforts
for
her
subjugation
the
little
which
it
would
have
been
possible
for
the
confederacy
to
do
to
promote
her
military
efficiency
was
diminished
by
the
anomalous
condition
in
which
the
state
troops
remained
until
some
time
in
the
second
year
of
the
war
a
strange
misapprehension
led
to
unreasonable
complaints
under
the
supposition
that
missouri
was
generally
neglected
and
her
favorite
officer
general
price
was
not
accorded
a
commission
corresponding
to
his
merit
and
the
wishes
of
the
people
it
is
due
to
that
gallant
soldier
and
true
patriot
that
it
should
here
be
stated
that
he
was
not
a
party
to
any
such
complaints
knew
they
were
unfounded
and
realized
that
his
wishes
for
the
defense
of
missouri
were
fully
reciprocated
by
the
executive
of
the
confederacy
all
of
which
was
manifested
in
the
correspondence
between
us
before
missouri
had
tendered
any
troops
to
the
confederate
states
it
was
his
statement
of
the
difficulties
and
embarrassments
which
surrounded
him
that
caused
me
to
write
to
the
governor
of
missouri
on
the
of
december
stating
to
him
my
anxiety
to
have
the
troops
of
missouri
tendered
and
organized
into
brigades
and
divisions
so
that
they
might
be
rendered
more
effective
and
we
be
better
able
to
provide
for
them
by
the
appointment
of
general
officers
and
otherwise
for
a
full
understanding
of
the
nature
and
degree
of
the
complaints
and
embarrassments
referred
to
i
here
insert
my
reply
to
letters
sent
to
me
by
the
hon
john
clarke
of
missouri
richmond
virginia
hon
john
clarke
sir
i
have
received
the
two
letters
from
governor
jackson
sent
by
you
this
day
the
governor
speaks
of
delay
by
the
authorities
of
richmond
and
neglect
of
the
interests
of
missouri
and
expresses
the
hope
that
he
has
said
enough
to
be
well
understood
by
me
when
i
remember
that
he
wrote
in
reply
to
my
call
upon
him
to
hasten
the
tender
of
missouri
troops
so
that
they
should
be
put
upon
the
footing
of
those
of
other
states
and
with
a
knowledge
that
as
militia
of
the
state
i
had
no
power
to
organize
or
appoint
commanders
for
them
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
attend
to
their
wants
but
that
i
had
sent
an
agent
of
the
confederate
government
as
far
as
practicable
to
furnish
the
necessary
supplies
to
the
militia
of
missouri
actually
in
service
i
can
only
say
i
hope
he
is
not
understood
by
me
it
is
but
a
short
time
since
in
a
conversation
of
hours
i
fully
explained
to
you
the
ease
so
far
as
i
am
connected
with
it
and
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
add
to
what
you
then
seemed
to
consider
conclusive
very
respectfully
yours
jefferson
davis
as
is
usually
the
case
when
citizens
are
called
from
their
ordinary
pursuits
for
the
purposes
of
war
the
people
of
missouri
did
not
then
realize
the
value
of
preparation
in
camp
and
were
reluctant
to
enroll
themselves
for
long
periods
the
state
even
less
than
the
confederate
government
could
not
supply
them
with
the
arms
munitions
and
equipage
necessary
for
campaigns
and
battles
and
sieges
under
all
these
disadvantages
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
that
they
were
able
to
achieve
so
much
the
missourians
who
fought
at
vicksburg
and
who
after
that
long
trying
and
disastrous
siege
asked
when
in
the
camp
of
parolled
prisoners
not
if
they
could
get
a
furlough
not
if
they
might
go
home
when
released
but
how
soon
they
might
hope
to
be
exchanged
and
resume
their
places
in
the
line
of
battle
show
of
what
metal
the
missouri
troops
were
made
and
of
what
they
were
capable
when
tempered
in
the
fiery
furnace
of
war
i
can
recall
few
scenes
during
the
war
which
impressed
me
more
deeply
than
the
spirit
of
those
worn
prisoners
waiting
for
the
exchange
that
would
again
permit
them
to
take
the
hazards
of
battle
for
the
cause
of
their
country
this
memory
leads
me
to
recur
with
regret
to
my
inability
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
convince
the
governor
of
missouri
of
the
necessity
for
thorough
organization
and
the
enrollment
of
men
for
long
terms
instead
of
loose
combinations
of
militia
for
periods
always
short
and
sometimes
uncertain
general
price
possessed
an
extraordinary
power
to
secure
the
personal
attachment
of
his
troops
and
to
inspire
them
with
a
confidence
which
served
in
no
small
degree
as
a
substitute
for
more
thorough
training
his
own
enthusiasm
and
entire
devotion
to
the
cause
he
served
were
infused
throughout
his
followers
and
made
them
all
their
country
own
to
lord
wellington
has
been
attributed
the
remark
that
he
did
not
want
zeal
in
a
soldier
and
to
napoleon
the
apothegm
that
providence
is
on
the
side
of
the
heavy
battalions
zeal
was
oftentimes
our
main
dependence
and
on
many
a
field
served
to
drive
our
small
battalions
like
a
wedge
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
enemy
the
confederate
states
yet
in
their
infancy
and
themselves
engaged
in
an
unequal
struggle
for
existence
by
act
of
their
congress
declared
that
if
missouri
was
engaged
in
repelling
a
lawless
invasion
of
her
territory
by
armed
forces
it
was
their
right
and
duty
to
aid
the
people
and
government
of
said
state
in
resisting
such
invasion
and
in
securing
the
means
and
the
opportunity
of
expressing
their
will
upon
all
questions
affecting
their
rights
and
liberties
with
small
means
compared
to
their
wants
the
confederate
congress
on
the
of
august
appropriated
one
million
dollars
to
aid
the
people
of
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
effort
to
maintain
within
their
own
limits
the
constitutional
liberty
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
confederate
states
in
the
existing
war
to
vindicate
etc
in
the
next
battle
after
that
of
carthage
which
has
been
noticed
missourians
were
no
longer
to
be
alone
general
mccullough
commanding
a
brigade
of
confederate
troops
marched
from
arkansas
to
make
a
junction
with
general
price
then
threatened
with
an
attack
by
a
large
force
of
the
enemy
under
general
lyon
which
was
concentrated
near
springfield
missouri
the
battle
was
fiercely
contested
but
finally
won
by
our
troops
in
this
action
general
lyon
was
killed
while
gallantly
endeavoring
to
rally
his
discomfited
troops
and
lead
them
to
the
charge
while
we
can
not
forget
the
cruel
wrongs
he
had
inflicted
and
sought
still
further
to
impose
upon
an
unoffending
people
we
must
accord
to
him
the
redeeming
virtue
of
courage
and
recognize
his
ability
as
a
soldier
on
this
occasion
general
price
exhibited
in
two
instances
the
magnanimity
and
humanity
which
ever
characterized
him
general
mcculloch
claimed
the
right
to
command
as
an
officer
of
the
confederate
states
army
general
price
though
he
ranked
him
by
a
grade
replied
that
he
was
not
fighting
for
distinction
but
for
the
defense
of
the
liberties
of
his
countrymen
and
that
it
mattered
but
little
what
position
he
occupied
he
said
he
was
ready
to
surrender
not
only
the
command
but
his
life
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
cause
he
surrendered
the
command
and
took
a
subordinate
position
though
he
felt
assured
of
victory
the
second
instance
was
an
act
of
humanity
to
his
bitterest
enemy
general
lyon
surgeon
came
in
for
his
body
under
a
flag
of
truce
after
the
close
of
the
battle
and
general
price
sent
it
in
his
own
wagon
but
the
enemy
in
his
flight
left
the
body
unshrouded
in
springfield
the
next
morning
august
gustavus
elgin
and
colonel
musser
two
members
of
brigadier
general
clarke
staff
caused
the
body
to
be
properly
prepared
for
burial
after
the
battle
of
springfield
general
mcculloch
returned
with
his
brigade
to
his
former
position
in
arkansas
john
fremont
had
been
appointed
a
general
and
assigned
to
the
command
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
general
lyon
he
signalized
his
entrance
upon
the
duty
by
a
proclamation
confiscating
the
estates
and
slave
property
of
rebels
on
the
of
september
when
general
price
was
about
to
go
into
camp
he
learned
that
a
detachment
of
federal
troops
was
marching
from
lexington
to
warrensburg
to
seize
the
funds
of
the
bank
in
that
place
and
to
arrest
and
plunder
the
citizens
of
johnson
county
in
accordance
with
general
fremont
proclamation
and
instructions
general
price
resumed
his
march
and
pressing
rapidly
forward
with
his
mounted
men
arrived
about
daybreak
at
warrensburg
where
he
learned
that
the
enemy
had
hastily
fled
about
midnight
he
then
decided
to
move
with
his
whole
force
against
lexington
he
found
the
enemy
in
strong
intrenchments
and
well
supplied
with
artillery
the
place
was
stubbornly
defended
the
siege
proper
commenced
on
the
of
september
and
with
varying
fortunes
fierce
combats
continued
through
that
day
and
the
next
on
the
morning
of
the
general
price
ordered
a
number
of
bales
of
hemp
to
be
transported
to
the
point
from
which
the
advance
of
his
troops
had
been
repeatedly
repulsed
they
were
ranged
in
a
line
for
a
breastwork
and
when
rolled
before
the
men
as
they
advanced
formed
a
moving
rampart
which
was
proof
against
shot
and
only
to
be
overcome
by
a
sortie
in
force
which
the
enemy
did
not
dare
to
make
on
came
the
hempen
breastworks
while
artillery
continued
an
effective
fire
in
the
afternoon
of
the
the
enemy
hung
out
a
white
flag
upon
which
general
price
ordered
a
cessation
of
firing
and
sent
to
ascertain
the
object
of
the
signal
the
federal
forces
surrendered
as
prisoners
of
war
to
the
number
of
hundred
also
seven
pieces
of
artillery
over
three
thousand
stand
of
muskets
a
considerable
number
of
sabres
a
valuable
supply
of
ammunition
a
number
of
horses
a
large
amount
of
stores
and
other
property
here
were
also
recovered
the
great
seal
of
the
state
and
the
public
records
and
about
nine
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
which
the
bank
of
lexington
had
been
robbed
general
price
caused
the
money
to
be
at
once
returned
to
the
bank
after
the
first
day
of
the
siege
of
lexington
general
price
learned
that
lane
and
montgomery
from
kansas
with
about
four
thousand
men
and
general
sturgis
with
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
were
on
the
north
side
of
the
missouri
river
advancing
to
reënforce
the
garrison
at
lexington
at
the
same
time
and
from
the
same
direction
colonel
saunders
with
about
hundred
missourians
was
coming
to
the
aid
of
general
price
general
atchison
who
had
long
been
a
united
states
senator
from
missouri
and
at
the
time
of
his
resignation
was
president
of
the
senate
was
sent
by
general
price
to
meet
the
command
of
colonel
saunders
and
hasten
them
forward
he
joined
them
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
and
after
all
but
about
five
hundred
had
been
ferried
over
general
atchison
still
remaining
with
these
they
were
unexpectedly
attacked
by
the
force
from
kansas
the
ground
was
densely
wooded
and
partially
covered
with
water
the
missourians
led
and
cheered
by
one
they
had
so
long
and
deservedly
honored
met
the
assault
with
such
determination
and
fighting
with
the
skill
of
woodsmen
and
hunters
that
they
put
the
enemy
to
rout
pursuing
him
for
a
distance
of
ten
miles
and
inflicting
heavy
loss
upon
him
while
that
of
the
missourians
was
but
five
killed
and
twenty
wounded
the
expedient
of
the
bales
of
hemp
was
a
brilliant
conception
not
unlike
that
which
made
tarik
the
saracen
warrior
immortal
and
gave
his
name
to
the
northern
pillar
of
hercules
the
victories
in
missouri
which
have
been
noticed
and
which
so
far
exceeded
what
might
have
been
expected
from
the
small
forces
by
which
they
were
achieved
had
caused
an
augmentation
of
the
enemy
troops
to
an
estimated
number
of
seventy
thousand
against
these
the
army
of
general
price
could
not
hope
successfully
to
contend
he
therefore
retired
toward
the
southwestern
part
of
the
state
the
want
of
supplies
and
transportation
compelled
him
to
disband
a
portion
of
his
troops
with
the
rest
he
continued
his
retreat
to
neosho
by
proclamation
of
governor
jackson
the
legislature
had
assembled
at
this
place
and
had
passed
the
ordinance
of
secession
if
other
evidence
were
wanting
the
fact
that
without
governmental
aid
without
a
military
chest
without
munitions
of
war
the
campaign
which
has
been
described
had
so
far
been
carried
on
by
the
voluntary
service
of
the
citizens
and
the
offerings
of
the
people
must
be
conclusive
that
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
the
expression
of
the
popular
will
of
missouri
the
forces
of
missouri
again
formed
a
junction
with
the
confederate
troops
under
general
mcculloch
and
together
they
moved
to
pineville

a

who
was
well
and
favorably
known
to
the
people
of
the
kanawha
valley
in
his
enthusiasm
for
their
defence
and
confidence
in
his
ability
to
rally
them
to
resist
the
threatened
invasion
of
that
region
offered
his
services
for
that
purpose
with
a
small
command
which
was
to
serve
as
a
nucleus
to
the
force
he
hoped
to
raise
he
was
sent
thither
his
success
was
as
great
as
could
have
been
reasonably
expected
and
after
the
small
but
brilliant
affair
on
scary
creek
he
prepared
to
give
battle
to
the
enemy
then
advancing
up
the
kanawha
valley
under
general
cox
but
the
defeat
of
our
forces
at
laurel
hill
which
has
been
already
noticed
uncovered
his
right
flank
and
endangered
his
rear
which
was
open
to
approach
by
several
roads
he
therefore
fell
back
to
lewisburg
john
floyd
had
in
the
mean
time
raised
a
brigade
in
southwestern
virginia
and
advanced
to
the
support
of
general
wise
unfortunately
there
was
a
want
of
concert
between
these
two
officers
which
prevented
their
entire
coöperation
general
floyd
engaged
the
enemy
in
several
brilliant
skirmishes
when
he
found
that
his
right
was
threatened
by
a
force
which
was
approaching
on
that
flank
with
the
apparent
purpose
of
crossing
the
gauley
river
at
the
carnifex
ferry
so
as
to
strike
his
line
of
communication
with
lewisburg
he
crossed
the
river
with
his
brigade
and
a
part
of
wise
cavalry
leaving
that
general
to
check
any
advance
which
cox
might
make
general
movement
was
as
successful
as
it
was
daring
he
met
the
enemy
forces
defeated
and
dispersed
them
but
the
want
of
coöperation
between
generals
wise
and
floyd
prevented
a
movement
against
general
cox
floyd
intrenched
himself
on
the
gauley
in
a
position
of
great
natural
strength
but
the
small
force
under
his
command
and
the
fact
that
he
was
separated
from
that
of
general
wise
probably
induced
general
rosecrans
commanding
the
enemy
forces
in
the
cheat
mountain
to
advance
and
assail
the
position
though
his
numbers
were
vastly
superior
the
attack
was
a
failure
after
a
heavy
loss
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
he
fell
back
after
nightfall
during
the
night
floyd
crossed
the
river
and
withdrew
to
the
camp
of
general
wise
to
form
a
junction
of
the
two
forces
and
together
they
fell
back
toward
sewell
mountain
the
unfortunate
controversy
between
these
officers
which
had
prevented
coöperation
in
the
past
grew
more
bitter
and
each
complained
of
the
other
in
terms
that
left
little
hope
of
future
harmony
and
this
want
of
coöperation
led
to
confusion
and
threatened
further
reverses
general
loring
had
succeeded
general
garnett
and
was
in
command
of
the
remnant
of
the
force
defeated
at
laurel
hill
his
headquarters
were
at
valley
mountain
general
lee
on
duty
at
richmond
aiding
the
president
in
the
general
direction
of
military
affairs
was
now
ordered
to
proceed
to
western
virginia
it
was
hoped
that
by
his
military
skill
and
deserved
influence
over
men
he
would
be
able
to
retrieve
the
disaster
we
had
suffered
at
laurel
hill
and
by
combining
all
our
forces
in
western
virginia
on
one
plan
of
operations
give
protection
to
that
portion
of
our
country
such
reënforcement
as
could
be
furnished
had
been
sent
to
valley
mountain
the
headquarters
of
general
loring
thither
general
lee
promptly
proceeded
the
duty
to
which
he
was
assigned
was
certainly
not
attractive
by
the
glory
to
be
gained
or
the
ease
to
be
enjoyed
but
lee
made
no
question
as
to
personal
preference
and
whatever
were
his
wishes
they
were
subordinate
to
what
was
believed
to
be
the
public
interest
the
season
had
been
one
of
extraordinary
rains
rendering
the
ordinarily
difficult
almost
impassable
with
unfaltering
purpose
and
energy
he
crossed
the
alleghany
mountains
and
learning
that
the
main
encampment
of
the
enemy
was
in
the
valley
of
tygart
river
and
elk
run
randolph
county
he
directed
his
march
toward
that
position
the
troops
under
the
immediate
command
of
jackson
together
with
those
under
loring
were
about
hundred
men
the
force
of
the
enemy
as
far
as
it
could
be
ascertained
was
very
much
greater
in
the
detached
work
at
cheat
mountain
pass
we
learned
by
a
found
upon
the
person
of
a
captured
that
there
were
three
thousand
men
being
but
a
fraction
less
than
our
whole
force
after
a
careful
reconnaissance
and
a
full
conference
with
general
loring
lee
decided
to
attack
the
main
encampment
of
the
enemy
by
a
movement
of
his
troops
converging
upon
the
valley
from
three
directions
the
colonel
of
one
of
his
regiments
who
had
reconnoitered
the
position
of
the
works
at
cheat
mountain
pass
reported
that
it
was
feasible
to
turn
it
and
carry
it
by
assault
and
he
was
assigned
to
that
duty
general
lee
ordered
other
portions
of
his
force
to
take
position
on
the
spurs
overlooking
the
enemy
main
encampment
while
he
led
three
regiments
to
the
height
below
and
nearest
to
the
position
of
the
enemy
the
instructions
were
that
the
officer
sent
to
turn
the
position
at
cheat
mountain
pass
should
approach
it
at
early
dawn
and
immediately
open
fire
which
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
concerted
attack
by
the
rest
of
the
force
it
rained
heavily
during
the
day
and
after
a
toilsome
the
force
led
by
general
lee
wet
weary
hungry
and
cold
gained
their
position
close
to
and
overlooking
the
encampment
in
their
march
they
had
surprised
and
captured
the
picket
without
a
gun
being
fired
so
that
no
notice
had
been
given
of
their
approach
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
to
attack
the
work
at
cheat
mountain
pass
found
on
closer
examination
that
he
had
been
mistaken
as
to
the
practicability
of
taking
it
by
assault
and
that
the
heavy
abatis
which
covered
it
was
advanced
beyond
the
range
of
his
rifles
not
having
understood
that
his
firing
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
general
attack
and
should
therefore
be
opened
whether
it
would
be
effective
or
not
he
withdrew
without
firing
a
musket
the
height
occupied
by
general
lee
was
shrouded
in
fog
and
as
morning
had
dawned
without
the
expected
signal
he
concluded
that
some
mishap
had
befallen
the
force
which
was
to
make
it
by
a
tortuous
path
he
went
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
low
enough
to
have
a
distinct
view
of
the
camp
he
saw
the
men
unconscious
of
the
near
presence
of
an
enemy
engaged
in
cleaning
their
arms
cooking
and
other
morning
occupations
then
returning
to
his
command
he
explained
to
his
senior
officers
what
he
had
seen
and
expressed
his
belief
that
though
the
plan
of
attack
had
failed
the
troops
there
with
him
could
surprise
and
capture
the
camp
the
officers
withdrew
conferred
with
their
men
and
reported
to
the
general
that
the
troops
were
not
in
condition
for
the
enterprise
as
the
fog
was
then
lifting
and
they
would
soon
be
revealed
to
the
enemy
below
whose
numbers
were
vastly
superior
to
his
own
he
withdrew
his
command
by
the
route
they
had
come
and
without
observation
returned
to
his
camp
beyond
some
skirmishes
with
outposts
and
reconnoitering
parties
our
troops
had
not
been
engaged
and
in
these
affairs
our
reported
loss
was
comparatively
small
colonel
john
washington
of
general
lee
was
killed
while
making
a
reconnaissance
by
a
party
in
ambuscade
the
loss
of
this
valuable
and
accomplished
officer
was
much
regretted
by
his
general
and
all
others
who
knew
him
the
report
that
rosecrans
and
cox
had
united
their
commands
and
were
advancing
upon
wise
and
floyd
caused
general
lee
to
move
at
once
to
their
support
he
found
general
floyd
at
meadow
bluff
and
general
wise
at
sewell
mountain
the
latter
position
being
very
favorable
for
defense
the
troops
were
concentrated
there
to
await
the
threatened
attack
by
rosecrans
who
advanced
and
took
position
in
sight
of
general
lee
intrenched
camp
and
having
remained
there
for
more
than
a
week
withdrew
in
the
night
without
attempting
the
expected
attack
the
weak
condition
of
his
and
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
made
worse
by
the
retiring
army
prevented
general
lee
from
attempting
to
pursue
and
the
approach
of
winter
always
rigorous
in
that
closed
the
campaign
with
a
small
but
brilliant
action
in
which
general
jackson
repelled
an
attack
of
a
greatly
superior
force
inflicting
severe
loss
on
the
assailants
and
losing
but
six
of
his
own
command
with
the
close
of
active
operations
general
lee
returned
to
richmond
and
though
subjected
to
depreciatory
criticism
by
the
who
make
campaigns
on
assumed
hypotheses
he
with
characteristic
made
no
defense
of
himself
not
even
presenting
an
official
report
of
his
in
the
cheat
mountain
but
orally
he
stated
to
me
the
facts
which
have
formed
the
basis
of
this
sketch
my
estimate
of
general
lee
my
confidence
in
his
ability
zeal
and
fidelity
rested
on
a
foundation
not
to
be
shaken
by
such
criticism
as
i
have
noticed
i
had
no
more
doubt
then
than
after
his
fame
had
been
securely
established
that
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
to
prove
his
worth
he
would
secure
public
appreciation
therefore
as
affairs
on
the
coast
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
were
in
an
unsatisfactory
condition
he
was
directed
to
go
there
and
take
such
measures
for
the
defense
particularly
of
savannah
and
charleston
as
he
should
find
needful
lest
the
newspaper
attack
should
have
created
unjust
and
unfavorable
impressions
in
regard
to
him
i
thought
it
desirable
to
write
to
governor
pickens
and
tell
him
what
manner
of
man
he
was
who
had
been
sent
to
south
carolina
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
confederate
army
from
fairfax
and
the
positions
which
had
been
occupied
in

of
that
place
a

was

a

was
thrown
over
and

by
the

which
held
them
in
check
at
the
point
of
crossing
in
the

another
brigade
was
thrown
over
at

impetuous

as
to
drive
back
the
enemy
to
the
bluff
and
their
leader
colonel
baker
having
fallen
a
panic
seemed
to
seize
the
command
so
that
they
rushed
headlong
down
the
bluff
and
crowded
into
the
which
were
their
means
of
transportation
in
such
numbers
that
they
were
sunk
and
many
of

were
drowned

by
their
representatives
in
the

houses
of

consistently
endeavored
even
to
the

day
when

had
by

ordained

proof
has
been
adduced
to
show
that
the
northern
states
by
a
majority
of
their
representatives
in
the
congress
had
persisted
in
agitation
injurious
to
the
welfare
and
tranquillity
of

at
the

had
refused
to
make
any
concessions
or
to
offer
any
guarantees
to
check
the
current
toward
secession
of
the
complaining
states
whose
love
for
the

rendered
them
willing
to
accept
less
than
justice
should
have
readily
accorded
the
issue
was
then
presented
between
submission
to
empire
of
the
north
or
the
severance
of
those
ties
consecrated
by
many
memories
and
strengthened
by
those
habits
which
render
every
people
reluctant
to
sever
associations
the
authorities
heretofore
cited
have
i
must
believe
conclusively
shown
that
the
question
of
changing
their
government
was
one
that
the
states
had
the
power
to
decide
by
virtue
of
the
unalienable
right
announced
in
the
declaration
of
independence
and
which
had
been
proudly
denominated
the
american
idea
of
government
the
hope
and
the
wish
of
the
people
of
the
south
were
that
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
separation
would
be
peacefully
met
and
be
followed
by
such
commercial
regulations
as
would
least
disturb
the
prosperity
and
future
intercourse
of
the
separated
states
every
step
taken
by
the
confederate
government
was
directed
toward
that
end
the
separation
of
the
states
having
been
decided
on
it
was
sought
to
effect
it
in
such
manner
as
would
be
just
to
the
parties
concerned
and
preserve
as
far
as
possible
under
separate
governments
the
fraternal
and
mutually
beneficial
relations
which
had
existed
between
the
states
when
united
and
which
it
was
the
object
of
their
compact
of
union
to
secure
to
all
the
proofs
heretofore
offered
i
confidently
refer
for
the
establishment
of
the
fact
that
whatever
of
bloodshed
of
devastation
or
shock
to
republican
government
has
resulted
from
the
war
is
to
be
charged
to
the
northern
states
the
invasions
of
the
southern
states
for
purposes
of
coercion
were
in
violation
of
the
written
constitution
and
the
attempt
to
subjugate
sovereign
states
under
the
pretext
of
preserving
the
union
was
alike
offensive
to
law
to
good
morals
and
the
proper
use
of
language
the
union
was
the
voluntary
junction
of
free
and
independent
states
to
subjugate
any
of
them
was
to
destroy
constituent
parts
and
necessarily
therefore
must
be
the
destruction
of
the
union
itself
that
the
southern
states
were
satisfied
with
a
federal
government
such
as
their
fathers
had
formed
was
shown
by
their
adoption
of
a
constitution
so
little
differing
from
the
instrument
of
it
was
against
the
violations
of
that
instrument
and
usurpations
offensive
to
their
pride
and
injurious
to
their
interests
that
they
remonstrated
argued
and
finally
appealed
to
the
inherent
undelegated
power
of
the
states
to
judge
of
their
wrongs
and
of
the
mode
and
measure
of
redress
after
many
years
of
fruitless
effort
to
secure
from
their
northern
associates
a
faithful
observance
of
the
compact
of
union
after
its
conditions
had
been
deliberately
and
persistently
broken
and
the
signs
of
the
times
indicated
further
and
more
ruthless
violations
of
their
rights
as
equals
in
the
union
the
southern
states
preferring
a
peaceful
separation
to
continuance
in
a
hostile
union
decided
to
exercise
their
sovereign
right
to
withdraw
from
an
association
which
had
failed
to
answer
the
ends
for
which
it
was
formed
it
has
been
shown
how
they
endeavored
to
effect
the
change
with
strict
regard
to
the
principles
controlling
a
dissolution
of
partnership
and
how
earnestly
they
desired
to
remain
in
friendly
relations
to
the
northern
states
and
how
all
their
overtures
were
rejected
when
they
pleaded
for
peace
the
united
states
government
deceptively
delayed
to
answer
while
making
ready
for
war
to
the
calm
judgment
of
mankind
is
submitted
the
question
who
was
responsible
for
the
war
between
the
states
virginia
whose
history
from
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
of
had
been
a
long
course
of
sacrifices
for
the
benefit
of
her
sister
states
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
she
had
mainly
contributed
to
establish
clung
to
it
with
the
devotion
of
a
mother
it
has
been
shown
how
her
efforts
to
check
dissolution
were
persisted
in
when
the
aggrieved
were
hopeless
and
the
aggressors
reckless
and
how
her
mediations
were
rejected
in
the
peace
congress
which
on
her
motion
had
been
assembled
sorrowing
over
the
failure
of
this
her
blessed
though
unsuccessful
attempt
to
preserve
the
union
the
she
was
not
permitted
to
mourn
as
a
neutral
but
was
required
by
the
united
states
government
to
choose
between
furnishing
troops
to
subjugate
her
southern
sisters
or
the
reclamation
of
the
grants
she
had
made
to
the
federal
government
when
she
became
a
member
of
the
union
the
first
was
a
violation
of
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
the
second
was
a
reserved
right
the
voice
of
henry
called
to
her
from
the
ground
the
spirits
of
washington
and
jefferson
moved
among
her
people
there
was
but
one
course
consistent
with
her
stainless
reputation
and
tenets
as
to
the
liberties
of
her
people
which
she
could
have
adopted
as
in
reluctantly
she
bowed
to
the
necessity
of
separation
from
the
crown
so
in
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
adopted
having
exhausted
all
other
means
she
took
the
last
resort
and
if
for
this
she
was
selected
as
the
first
object
of
assault
methinks
the
punishment
exceedeth
the
offense
the
large
resources
and
full
preparation
of
the
united
states
government
enabled
it
to
girt
virginia
as
with
a
wall
of
fire
it
has
been
shown
that
she
was
threatened
from
the
east
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
the
capital
of
the
state
and
of
the
confederacy
richmond
was
the
objective
point
and
on
this
the
march
of
three
columns
concentrated
on
the
east
the
advance
of
the
enemy
was
on
several
occasions
feasible
when
we
consider
the
number
of
his
forces
at
and
about
fortress
monroe
in
comparison
with
the
small
means
retained
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
on
the
north
the
most
formidable
army
of
the
enemy
was
assembled
to
oppose
it
we
had
the
comparatively
small
army
of
the
potomac
this
being
regarded
as
the
line
on
which
the
greatest
danger
was
apprehended
our
efforts
were
mostly
directed
toward
giving
it
the
requisite
strength
troops
as
rapidly
as
they
could
be
raised
and
armed
were
sent
forward
for
that
purpose
from
the
beginning
to
the
close
of
the
war
we
mainly
relied
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
on
its
aged
citizens
boys
too
young
for
service
and
the
civil
employees
of
the
executive
departments
on
several
occasions
these
were
called
out
to
resist
an
attack
they
answered
with
alacrity
and
always
bore
themselves
gallantly
more
than
once
repelling
the
enemy
in
the
open
field
had
it
been
practicable
to
do
so
it
would
surely
have
been
proper
to
keep
a
large
force
in
reserve
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
so
often
and
vauntingly
proclaimed
to
be
the
object
of
the
campaign
perhaps
the
propriety
of
such
provision
gave
currency
and
credence
to
rumors
that
we
had
a
large
force
at
richmond
this
even
led
to
the
application
for
a
detachment
from
it
to
reënforce
our
army
of
the
potomac
which
caused
me
to
write
to
general
johnston
at
manassas
virginia
on
september
as
follows
you
have
again
been
deceived
as
to
the
forces
here
we
never
have
had
anything
near
to
twenty
thousand
men
and
have
now
but
little
over
one
fourth
of
that
number
since
the
date
of
your
glorious
victory
the
enemy
have
grown
weaker
in
numbers
and
far
weaker
in
the
character
of
their
troops
so
that
i
had
felt
it
remained
with
us
to
decide
whether
another
battle
should
soon
be
fought
or
not
your
remark
indicates
a
different
opinion
i
wish
i
could
send
additional
force
to
occupy
loudon
but
my
means
are
short
of
the
wants
of
each
division
i
am
laboring
to
protect
one
of
would
enable
me
to
answer
all
demands
but
vainly
have
i
hoped
and
waited
then
there
and
everywhere
our
difficulty
was
the
want
of
arms
and
munitions
of
war
lamentable
cries
came
to
us
from
the
west
for
the
supplies
which
would
enable
patriotic
citizens
to
defend
their
homes
the
resource
upon
which
the
people
had
so
confidently
relied
the
private
arms
in
the
hands
of
citizens
proved
a
sad
delusion
and
elsewhere
it
has
been
shown
how
deficient
we
were
in
ammunition
or
the
means
of
providing
it
the
simple
fact
was
the
country
had
gone
to
war
without
counting
the
cost
undue
elation
over
our
victory
at
manassas
was
followed
by
dissatisfaction
at
what
was
termed
the
failure
to
reap
the
fruits
of
victory
and
rumors
for
which
there
could
be
no
better
excuse
than
partisan
zeal
were
circulated
that
the
heroes
of
the
hour
were
prevented
from
reaping
the
fruits
of
the
victory
by
the
interference
of
the
president
naturally
there
followed
another
rumor
that
the
inaction
of
the
victorious
army
to
which
reënforcements
continued
to
be
sent
was
due
to
the
policy
of
the
president
and
he
also
was
held
responsible
and
with
more
apparent
justice
for
the
failure
to
organize
the
troops
of
the
several
states
as
the
law
contemplated
into
brigades
and
divisions
composed
of
the
soldiers
of
each
though
these
unjust
criticisms
weakened
the
power
of
the
government
to
meet
its
present
and
provide
for
its
future
necessities
i
bore
them
in
silence
lest
to
vindicate
myself
should
injure
the
public
service
by
turning
the
public
censure
to
the
generals
on
whom
the
hopes
of
the
country
rested
that
motive
no
longer
exists
and
to
justify
the
faith
of
those
who
without
a
defense
continued
to
uphold
my
hands
i
propose
to
set
forth
the
facts
by
correspondence
and
otherwise
so
far
as
in
doing
this
blame
shall
be
transferred
from
me
to
others
it
will
be
the
incident
not
the
design
as
it
would
be
most
gratifying
to
me
only
to
notice
for
praise
each
and
all
who
wore
the
gray
the
fiction
of
my
having
prevented
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
after
the
victory
of
manassas
was
exploded
after
it
had
acquired
an
authoritative
and
form
in
the
manner
and
for
the
reasons
heretofore
set
forth
it
only
remains
therefore
to
notice
the
other
points
indicated
above
first
the
organization
of
the
army
disease
and
discontent
are
known
to
be
the
attendants
of
armies
lying
unemployed
in
camps
especially
as
in
our
case
when
the
troops
were
composed
of
citizens
called
from
their
homes
under
the
idea
of
a
pressing
necessity
and
with
the
hope
of
soon
returning
to
them
our
citizen
soldiers
were
a
powerful
political
element
and
their
correspondence
finding
its
way
to
the
people
through
the
press
and
to
the
halls
of
congress
by
direct
communication
with
the
members
was
felt
by
its
influence
both
upon
public
opinion
and
general
legislation
members
of
congress
and
notably
the
contended
that
men
should
be
allowed
to
go
home
and
attend
to
their
private
affairs
while
there
were
no
active
operations
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
they
would
return
whenever
there
was
to
be
a
battle
the
experience
of
war
soon
taught
our
people
the
absurdity
of
such
ideas
and
before
its
close
probably
none
would
have
uttered
them
there
were
very
many
men
out
of
the
army
who
were
anxious
to
enter
it
but
for
whom
we
had
not
arms
this
gave
rise
to
the
remark
more
humorous
than
profound
that
we
stood
around
the
camps
with
clubs
to
keep
one
set
in
and
an
other
set
out
had
this
been
true
it
was
certainly
justifiable
to
refuse
to
exchange
a
trained
man
for
a
recruit
all
who
have
seen
service
know
that
one
old
soldier
is
in
campaign
equal
to
several
who
have
everything
of
military
life
to
learn
a
marked
characteristic
of
the
southern
people
was
individuality
and
time
was
needful
to
teach
them
that
the
terrible
machine
a
disciplined
army
must
be
made
of
men
who
had
surrendered
their
freedom
of
will
the
most
distinguished
of
our
citizens
were
not
the
slowest
to
learn
the
lesson
and
perhaps
no
army
ever
more
thoroughly
knew
it
than
did
that
which
lee
led
into
pennsylvania
and
none
ever
had
a
leader
who
in
his
own
conduct
better
illustrated
the
lesson
our
largest
army
in
was
that
of
the
potomac
it
had
been
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
forces
under
general
johnston
with
those
under
general
beauregard
with
such
additions
as
could
be
hurriedly
sent
forward
to
meet
the
enemy
on
the
field
of
manassas
they
were
combined
into
brigades
and
divisions
as
pressing
exigencies
required
by
the
act
of
february
the
president
was
authorized
to
receive
companies
battalions
and
regiments
to
form
a
part
of
the
provisional
army
of
the
confederate
states
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
congress
to
appoint
general
officers
for
them
and
by
the
act
of
march
the
president
was
to
apportion
the
staff
and
general
officers
among
the
respective
states
from
which
the
volunteers
were
received
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
states
generously
surrendered
their
right
to
preserve
for
those
volunteers
the
character
of
state
troops
and
to
appoint
general
officers
when
furnishing
a
sufficient
number
of
regiments
to
require
such
grade
for
their
command
but
in
giving
their
volunteers
to
form
the
provisional
army
of
the
confederacy
it
was
distinctly
suggested
that
the
general
officers
should
be
so
appointed
as
to
make
a
just
apportionment
among
the
states
furnishing
the
troops
during
the
repose
which
followed
the
battle
of
manassas
it
was
deemed
proper
that
the
regiments
of
the
different
states
should
be
assembled
in
brigades
together
and
as
far
as
consistent
with
the
public
service
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
should
be
complied
with
by
the
assignment
of
of
the
same
state
from
which
the
troops
were
drawn
instructions
to
that
end
were
therefore
given
and
again
and
again
repeated
but
were
for
a
long
time
only
partially
complied
with
until
the
delay
formed
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
those
who
had
by
association
become
thoroughly
acquainted
would
more
advantageously
be
left
united
in
the
mean
time
frequent
complaints
came
to
me
from
the
army
of
unjust
discrimination
the
law
being
executed
in
regard
to
the
troops
of
some
states
but
not
of
others
and
of
serious
discontent
arising
therefrom
the
duty
to
obey
the
law
was
imperative
and
neither
the
executive
nor
the
officers
of
the
army
had
any
right
to
question
its
propriety
i
however
considered
the
policy
of
that
law
wise
and
was
not
surprised
when
it
was
stated
to
me
that
the
persistent
obstruction
to
its
execution
was
repressing
the
spirit
to
volunteer
in
places
to
which
complaints
of
such
supposed
favoritism
had
been
transmitted
about
the
of
october
at
the
request
of
general
johnston
i
went
to
his
headquarters
at
fairfax
for
the
purpose
of
conference
at
the
time
of
this
visit
to
the
army
the
attention
of
the
general
officers
who
then
met
me
in
conference
was
called
to
the
obligation
created
by
law
to
organize
the
troops
when
the
numbers
tendered
by
any
state
permitted
it
into
brigades
and
divisions
composed
of
the
regiments
battalions
or
companies
of
such
state
and
to
assign
general
and
staff
officers
in
the
ratio
of
the
troops
thus
received
after
my
return
to
the
capital
the
importance
of
the
subject
weighed
so
heavily
upon
me
as
to
lead
to
correspondence
with
the
generals
which
will
be
best
understood
by
the
following
extracts
from
my
letters
to
them
which
are
here
appended
smith
of
how
have
you
progressed
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
i
left
the
organization
of
the
troops
with
reference
to
the
states
and
term
of
service
if
the
volunteers
continue
their
complaints
that
they
are
commanded
by
strangers
and
do
not
get
justice
and
that
they
are
kept
in
camp
to
die
when
reported
for
hospital
by
the
surgeon
we
shall
soon
feel
a
reaction
in
the
matter
of
volunteering
already
i
have
been
much
pressed
on
both
subjects
and
have
answered
by
promising
that
the
generals
would
give
due
attention
and
i
hoped
make
satisfactory
changes
the
authority
to
organize
regiments
into
brigades
and
the
latter
into
divisions
is
by
law
conferred
only
on
the
president
and
i
must
be
able
to
assume
responsibility
of
the
action
taken
by
whomsoever
acts
for
me
in
that
regard
by
reference
to
the
law
you
will
see
that
in
surrendering
the
sole
power
to
appoint
general
officers
it
was
nevertheless
designed
as
far
as
should
be
found
consistent
to
keep
up
the
state
relation
of
troops
and
generals
kentucky
has
a
brigadier
but
not
a
brigade
she
has
however
a
regiment
that
regiment
and
brigadier
might
be
associated
together
louisiana
had
regiments
enough
to
form
a
brigade
but
no
brigadier
in
either
corps
all
of
the
regiments
were
sent
to
that
corps
commanded
by
a
louisiana
general
georgia
has
regiments
now
organized
into
two
brigades
she
has
on
duty
with
that
army
two
brigadiers
but
one
of
them
serves
with
other
troops
mississippi
troops
were
scattered
as
if
the
state
were
unknown
clark
was
sent
to
remove
a
growing
dissatisfaction
but
though
the
state
had
nine
regiments
there
he
clark
was
put
in
command
of
a
post
and
depot
of
supplies
these
nine
regiments
should
form
two
brigades
brigadiers
clark
and
as
a
native
of
mississippi
whiting
should
be
placed
in
command
of
them
and
the
regiments
for
the
war
put
in
the
army
man
brigade
both
brigades
should
be
put
in
the
division
commanded
by
general
van
dorn
of
mississippi
thus
would
the
spirit
and
intent
of
the
law
be
complied
with
disagreeable
complaint
be
spared
me
and
more
of
content
be
assured
under
the
trials
to
which
you
look
forward
it
is
needless
to
specify
further
i
have
been
able
in
writing
to
you
to
speak
freely
and
you
have
no
past
associations
to
disturb
the
judgment
to
be
passed
upon
the
views
presented
i
have
made
and
am
making
inquiries
as
to
the
practicability
of
getting
a
corps
of
negroes
for
laborers
to
aid
in
the
construction
of
an
intrenched
line
in
rear
of
your
present
position
your
remarks
on
the
want
of
efficient
are
realized
in
all
their
force
and
i
hope
among
the
elements
which
constitute
a
for
volunteers
you
have
duly
estimated
the
qualities
of
forbearance
and
urbanity
many
of
the
privates
are
men
of
high
social
position
of
scholarship
and
fortune
their
pride
furnishes
the
motive
for
good
conduct
and
if
wounded
is
turned
from
an
instrument
of
good
to
one
of
great
power
for
evil
richmond
virginia
general
beauregard
i
have
thought
often
upon
the
questions
of
reorganization
which
were
submitted
to
you
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
whether
in
view
of
disease
or
the
disappointment
and
suffering
of
a
winter
cantonment
on
a
line
of
defense
or
of
a
battle
to
be
fought
in
and
near
your
position
it
was
desirable
to
combine
the
troops
by
a
new
distribution
with
as
little
delay
as
practicable
they
will
be
stimulated
to
extraordinary
effort
when
so
organized
in
that
the
fame
of
their
state
will
be
in
their
keeping
and
that
each
will
feel
that
his
immediate
commander
will
desire
to
exalt
rather
than
diminish
his
services
you
pointed
me
to
the
fact
that
you
had
observed
that
rule
in
the
case
of
the
louisiana
and
carolina
troops
and
you
will
not
fail
to
perceive
that
others
find
in
the
fact
a
reason
for
the
like
disposal
of
them
in
the
hour
of
sickness
and
the
tedium
of
waiting
for
spring
men
from
the
same
region
will
best
console
and
relieve
each
other
the
maintenance
of
our
cause
rests
on
the
sentiments
of
the
people
letters
from
the
camp
complaining
of
inequality
and
harshness
in
the
treatment
of
the
men
have
already
dulled
the
enthusiasm
which
filled
our
ranks
with
men
who
by
birth
fortune
education
and
social
position
were
the
equals
of
any
officer
in
the
land
the
spirit
of
our
military
law
is
manifested
in
the
fact
that
the
state
organization
was
limited
to
the
regiment
the
volunteers
come
in
sufficient
numbers
to
have
brigadiers
but
have
only
colonels
it
was
not
then
intended
is
the
necessary
conclusion
that
those
troops
should
be
under
the
immediate
command
of
officers
above
the
grade
of
colonel
the
spirit
of
the
law
then
indicates
that
brigades
should
be
larger
than
customary
the
general
being
charged
with
the
care
the
direction
the
preservation
of
the
men
rather
than
the
internal
police
richmond
virginia
general
beauregard
my
dear
general
two
rules
have
been
applied
in
the
projected
reorganization
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
as
far
as
practicable
to
keep
regiments
from
the
same
state
together
to
assign
generals
to
command
the
troops
of
their
own
state
i
have
not
overlooked
the
objections
to
each
but
the
advantages
are
believed
to
outweigh
the
disadvantages
of
that
arrangement
in
distributing
the
regiments
of
the
several
states
it
would
i
think
be
better
to
place
the
regiments
for
the
war
in
the
same
brigade
of
the
state
and
assign
to
those
brigades
the
brigadiers
whose
services
could
least
easily
be
dispensed
with
for
this
among
other
reasons
i
will
mention
but
one
the
commission
of
a
brigadier
expires
upon
the
breaking
up
of
his
brigade
see
the
law
for
their
appointment
of
course
i
would
not
for
slight
cause
change
the
relations
of
troops
and
commanders
especially
where
it
has
been
long
continued
and
endeared
by
the
trials
of
battle
but
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
regiment
was
fixed
as
the
unit
of
organization
and
made
the
connecting
link
between
the
soldier
and
his
home
above
that
all
was
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
confederate
authorities
save
the
pregnant
intimation
in
relation
to
the
distribution
of
generals
among
the
several
states
it
was
generous
and
confiding
to
surrender
entirely
to
the
confederacy
the
appointment
of
generals
and
it
is
the
more
incumbent
on
me
to
carry
out
as
well
as
may
be
the
spirit
of
the
volunteer
system
richmond
general
johnston
your
attention
has
been
heretofore
called
to
the

have
been
asked
for
from
the
commanders
of
separate
armies
as
to
the
composition
of
their
respective
brigades
and
divisions
i
have
been
much
harassed
and
the
public
interest
has
certainly
suffered
by
the
delay
to
place
the
regiments
of
some
of
the
states
in
brigades
together
it
being
deemed
that
unjust
discrimination
was
made
against
them
and
also
by
the
popular
error
which
has
existed
as
to
the
number
of
brigadiers
to
which
appointments
could
be
specially
urged
on
the
grounds
of
residence
while
some
have
expressed
surprise
at
my
patience
when
orders
to
you
were
not
observed
i
have
at
least
hoped
that
you
would
recognize
the
desire
to
aid
and
sustain
you
and
that
it
would
produce
the
corresponding
action
on
your
part
the
reasons
formerly
offered
have
one
after
another
disappeared
and
i
hope
you
will
as
you
can
proceed
to
organize
your
troops
as
heretofore
instructed
and
that
the
returns
will
relieve
us
of
the
uncertainty
now
felt
as
to
the
number
and
relations
of
the
troops
and
the
commands
of
the
officers
having
brigades
and
divisions
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
lost
opportunity
afforded
along
the
line
of
northern
virginia
but
must
call
your
attention
to
the
present
condition
of
affairs
and
probable
action
of
the
enemy
if
not
driven
from
his
purpose
to
advance
on
the
fredericksburg
route
very
truly
yours
jefferson
davis
on
the
of
may
general
johnston
attention
was
again
called
to
the
organization
of
the
ten
mississippi
regiments
into
two
brigades
and
was
reminded
that
the
proposition
had
been
made
to
him
in
the
previous
autumn
with
an
expression
of
my
confidence
that
the
regiments
would
be
more
effective
in
battle
if
thus
associated
i
will
now
proceed
to
notice
the
allegation
that
i
was
responsible
for
inaction
by
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
the
latter
part
of
and
in
the
early
part
of
after
the
explosion
of
the
fallacy
that
i
had
prevented
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
from
manassas
in
july
my
assailants
have
sought
to
cover
their
exposure
by
a
change
of
time
and
place
locating
their
story
at
fairfax
and
dating
it
in
the
autumn
of
when
at
that
time
and
place
i
met
general
johnston
for
conference
he
called
in
the
two
generals
next
in
rank
to
himself
beauregard
and
smith
the
question
for
consideration
was
what
course
should
be
adopted
for
the
future
action
of
the
army
and
the
preliminary
inquiry
by
me
was
as
to
the
number
of
the
troops
there
assembled
to
my
surprise
and
disappointment
the
effective
strength
was
stated
to
be
but
little
greater
than
when
it
fought
the
battle
of
the
of
the
preceding
july
the
frequent
reënforcements
which
had
been
sent
to
that
army
in
nowise
prepared
me
for
such
an
announcement
to
my
inquiry
as
to
what
force
would
be
required
for
the
contemplated
advance
into
maryland
the
lowest
estimate
made
by
any
of
them
was
about
twice
the
number
there
present
for
duty
how
little
i
was
prepared
for
such
a
condition
of
things
will
be
realized
from
the
fact
that
previous
suggestions
by
the
generals
in
regard
to
a
purpose
to
advance
into
maryland
had
induced
me
when
i
went
to
that
conference
to
take
with
me
some
drawings
made
by
the
veteran
soldier
and
engineer
colonel
crozêt
of
the
falls
of
the
potomac
to
show
the
feasibility
of
crossing
the
river
at
that
point
very
little
knowledge
of
the
condition
and
military
resources
of
the
country
must
have
sufficed
to
show
that
i
had
no
power
to
make
such
an
addition
to
that
army
without
a
total
disregard
of
the
safety
of
other
threatened
positions
it
only
remained
for
me
to
answer
that
i
had
not
power
to
furnish
such
a
number
of
troops
and
unless
the
militia
bearing
their
private
arms
should
be
relied
on
we
could
not
possibly
fulfill
such
a
requisition
until
after
the
receipt
of
the
which
we
had
early
and
constantly
striven
to
procure
from
abroad
and
had
for
some
time
expected
after
i
had
written
the
foregoing
and
all
the
succeeding
chapters
on
kindred
subjects
a
friend
in
october
furnished
me
with
a
copy
of
a
paper
relating
to
the
conference
at
fairfax
which
seems
to
require
notice
at
my
hands
therefore
i
break
the
chain
of
events
to
insert
here
some
remarks
in
regard
to
it
the
paper
appears
to
have
been
written
by
general
smith
and
to
have
received
the
approval
of
generals
beauregard
and
johnston
and
to
bear
date
the
of
january
it
does
not
agree
in
some
respects
with
my
memory
of
what
occurred
and
is
not
consistent
with
itself
it
was
not
necessary
that
i
should
learn
in
that
interview
the
evil
of
inactivity
my
correspondence
of
anterior
date
might
have
shown
that
i
was
fully
aware
of
it
and
my
suggestions
in
the
interview
certainly
did
not
look
as
if
it
was
necessary
to
impress
me
with
the
advantage
of
action
in
one
part
of
the
paper
it
is
stated
that
the
reënforcements
asked
for
were
to
be
seasoned
soldiers
such
as
were
there
present
and
who
were
said
to
be
in
the
finest
fighting
condition
this
if
such
a
proposition
had
been
made
would
have
exposed
its
absurdity
as
well
as
the
loophole
it
offered
for
escape
by
subsequently
asserting
that
the
troops
furnished
were
not
up
to
the
proposed
standard
in
another
part
of
the
paper
it
is
stated
that
there
were
hope
and
expectation
that
before
the
end
of
the
winter
arms
would
be
introduced
into
the
country
and
that
then
we
could
successfully
invade
that
of
the
enemy
but
this
supply
of
arms
however
abundant
could
not
furnish
seasoned
soldiers
and
the
two
propositions
are
therefore
inconsistent
in
one
place
it
is
written
that
it
was
felt
it
might
be
better
to
run
the
risk
of
almost
certain
destruction
fighting
upon
the
other
side
of
the
potomac
rather
than
see
the
gradual
dying
out
and
deterioration
of
this
army
during
a
winter
etc
but
when
it
was
proposed
to
cross
into
eastern
maryland
on
a
steamer
in
our
possession
for
a
partial
campaign
difficulties
arose
like
the
lion
in
the
path
of
the
sluggard
so
that
the
proposition
was
postponed
and
never
executed
in
like
manner
the
other
expedition
in
the
valley
of
virginia
was
achieved
by
an
officer
not
of
this
council
general
jackson
in
one
place
it
is
written
that
the
president
stated
at
that
time
no
reënforcements
could
be
furnished
to
the
army
of
the
character
asked
for
in
another
place
he
is
made
to
say
he
could
not
take
any
troops
from
the
points
named
and
without
arms
from
abroad
could
not
reënforce
that
army
here
again
it
is
clear
from
the
answer
that
the
proposition
had
been
for
such
reënforcement
as
additional
arms
would
enable
him
to
give
those
arms
he
expected
to
receive
barring
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
of
the
enemy
which
obstacles
alone
prevented
the
positive
assurance
that
they
would
be
received
at
all
it
was
as
stated
with
deep
regret
and
bitter
disappointment
that
i
found
notwithstanding
our
diligent
efforts
to
reënforce
this
army
before
and
after
the
battle
of
manassas
that
its
strength
had
but
little
increased
and
that
the
arms
of
absentees
and
discharged
men
were
represented
by
only
hundred
on
hand
i
can
not
suppose
that
general
johnston
could
have
noticed
the
statement
that
his
request
for
conference
had
set
forth
the
object
of
it
to
be
to
discuss
the
question
of
reënforcement
he
would
have
known
that
in
richmond
where
all
the
returns
were
to
be
found
any
consideration
of
reënforcement
by
the
withdrawal
of
troops
from
existing
garrisons
could
best
be
decided
very
little
experience
or
a
fair
amount
of
modesty
without
any
experience
would
serve
to
prevent
one
from
announcing
his
conclusion
that
troops
could
be
withdrawn
from
a
place
or
places
without
knowing
how
many
were
there
and
what
was
the
necessity
for
their
presence
i
was
at
the
conference
by
request
the
confidence
felt
in
those
officers
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
i
met
them
alone
and
did
not
require
any
minutes
to
be
made
of
the
meeting
about
four
months
afterward
a
paper
was
prepared
to
make
a
record
of
the
conversation
the
fact
was
concealed
from
me
whereas
both
for
accuracy
and
frankness
it
should
have
been
submitted
to
me
even
if
there
had
been
nothing
due
to
our
official
relations
twenty
years
after
the
event
i
learned
of
this
secret
report
by
one
party
without
notice
having
been
given
to
the
other
of
a
conversation
said
to
have
lasted
two
hours
i
have
noticed
the
improbabilities
and
inconsistencies
of
the
paper
and
without
remark
i
submit
to
honorable
men
the
concealment
from
me
in
which
it
was
prepared
whereby
they
may
judge
of
the
chances
for
such
as
needs
must
exist
between
the
executive
and
the
commanders
of
armies
to
insure
attainable
success
the
position
at
fairfax
though
it
would
answer
very
well
as
a
point
from
which
to
advance
was
quite
unfavorable
for
defense
and
when
i
so
remarked
the
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
to
which
the
generals
had
previously
arrived
it
therefore
only
remained
to
consider
what
change
of
position
should
be
made
in
the
event
of
the
enemy
threatening
soon
to
advance
but
in
the
mean
time
i
hoped
that
something
could
be
done
by
detachments
from
the
army
to
effect
objects
less
difficult
than
an
advance
against
his
main
force
and
particularly
indicated
the
lower
part
of
maryland
where
a
small
force
was
said
to
be
ravaging
the
country
and
oppressing
our
friends
this
i
thought
might
be
feasible
by
the
establishment
of
a
battery
near
to
acquia
creek
where
the
channel
of
the
potomac
was
said
to
be
so
narrow
that
our
guns
could
prevent
the
use
of
the
river
by
the
enemy
boats
and
by
employing
a
steamboat
lying
there
troops
enough
could
be
sent
over
some
night
to
defeat
that
force
and
return
before
any
large
body
could
be
concentrated
against
them
the
effect
of
the
battery
and
of
the
expedition
it
was
hoped
would
be
important
in
relieving
our
friends
and
securing
recruits
from
those
who
wished
to
join
us
previously
general
johnston
attention
had
been
called
to
possibilities
in
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
and
that
these
and
other
like
things
were
not
done
was
surely
due
to
other
causes
than
the
policy
of
the
administration
as
will
appear
by
the
letters
hereto
annexed
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
general
lee
has
gone
to
western
virginia
and
i
hope
may
be
able
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
in
that
quarter
or
failing
in
that
will
be
able
to
organize
and
post
our
troops
so
as
to
check
the
enemy
after
which
he
will
return
to
this
place
the
movement
of
banks
will
require
your
attention
it
may
be
a
but
if
a
real
movement
when
your
army
has
the
requisite
strength
and
mobility
you
will
probably
find
an
opportunity
by
a
rapid
movement
through
the
passes
to
strike
him
in
rear
or
flank
and
thus
add
another
to
your
many
claims
to
your
country
gratitude
we
must
be
prompt
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
weakness
resulting
from
the
exchange
of
the
new
and
less
reliable
forces
of
the
enemy
for
those
heretofore
in
service
as
well
as
of
the
moral
effect
produced
by
their
late
defeat
i
am
as
ever
your
friend
jefferson
davis
from
the
correspondence
which
occurred
after
the
conference
at
fairfax
i
select
a
reply
made
to
general
smith
who
had
written
to
me
in
advocacy
of
the
views
he
had
then
expressed
about
large
reënforcements
to
the
army
of
the
potomac
for
an
advance
into
maryland
nothing
is
more
common
than
that
a
general
realizing
the
wants
of
the
army
with
which
he
is
serving
and
the
ends
that
might
be
achieved
if
those
wants
were
supplied
should
overlook
the
necessities
of
others
and
accept
rumors
of
large
forces
which
do
not
exist
and
assume
the
absence
of
danger
elsewhere
than
in
his
own
front
richmond
virginia
smith
of
the
your
remarks
about
the
moral
effect
of
repressing
the
hope
of
the
volunteers
for
an
advance
are
in
accordance
with
the
painful
impression
made
on
me
when
in
our
council
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
been
reduced
to
about
one
half
the
legalized
strength
and
that
the
arms
to
restore
the
numbers
were
not
in
depot
as
i
there
suggested
though
you
may
not
be
able
to
advance
into
maryland
and
expel
the
enemy
it
may
be
possible
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
your
troops
by
expeditions
such
as
that
particularly
spoken
of
against
sickles
brigade
on
the
lower
potomac
or
above
by
destroying
the
canal
and
making
other
rapid
movements
wherever
opportunity
presents
to
beat
detachments
or
to
destroy
lines
of
communication
very
truly
your
friend
jefferson
davis
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
if
a
large
force
should
be
landed
on
the
potomac
below
general
holmes
with
the
view
to
turn
or
to
attack
him
the
value
of
the
position
between
dumfries
and
fredericksburg
will
be
so
great
that
i
wish
you
to
give
to
that
line
your
personal
inspection
with
a
sufficient
force
the
enemy
may
be
prevented
from
leaving
his
boats
should
he
be
able
to
cross
the
river
to
make
our
force
available
at
either
of
the
points
which
he
may
select
it
will
be
necessary
to
improve
the
roads
connecting
the
advance
posts
with
the
armies
of
the
potomac
and
of
the
acquia
as
well
as
with
each
other
and
to
have
the
requisite
teams
to
move
heavy
guns
with
celerity
very

in
november
reports
became
current
that
the
enemy
were
concentrating
troops
west
of
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
with
a
view
to
a
descent
upon
it
that
vigilant
enterprising
and
patriotic
soldier
general
jackson
whose
steadiness
under
fire
at
the
first
battle
of
manassas
had
procured
for
him
the
of
stonewall
was
then
on
duty
as
district
commander
of
the
shenandoah
valley
he
was
a
west
virginian
and
though
he
had
not
acquired
the
fame
which
subsequently
shed
such
luster
upon
his
name
he
possessed
a
confidence
among
the
people
of
that
region
ever
watchful
and
daring
in
the
discharge
of
any
duty
he
was
intensely
anxious
to
guard
his
beloved
mountains
of
virginia
this
stimulating
his
devotion
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
confederacy
induced
him
to
desire
to
march
against
the
enemy
who
had
captured
romney
on
the
of
november
he
wrote
to
the
war
department
proposing
an
expedition
to
romney
in
western
virginia
it
was
decided
to
adopt
his
proposition
endorsed
by
the
commander
of
the
department
and
further
to
insure
success
though
not
recommended
in
the
endorsement
his
old
brigade
then
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
selected
as
a
part
of
the
command
with
which
he
was
to
make
the
campaign
general
johnston
remonstrated
against
this
transfer
and
the
correspondence
is
subjoined
for
a
fuller
understanding
of
the
matter
headquarters
valley
district
hon
benjamin
of
sir
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
for
requesting
that
at
once
all
the
troops
under
general
loring
be
ordered
to
this
point
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
absolute
secrecy
respecting
military
operations
i
have
made
it
a
point
to
say
but
little
respecting
my
proposed
movements
in
the
event
of
sufficient
reënforcements
arriving
but
since
conversing
with
preston
upon
his
return
from
general
loring
and
ascertaining
the
disposition
of
the
forces
i
venture
to
respectfully
urge
that
after
concentrating
all
his
troops
here
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
capture
the
federal
forces
at
romney
the
attack
on
romney
would
probably
induce
mcclellan
to
believe
that
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
been
so
weakened
as
to
justify
him
in
making
an
advance
on
centreville
but
should
this
not
induce
him
to
advance
i
do
not
believe
anything
will
during
the
present
winter
should
the
army
of
the
potomac
be
attacked
i
would
be
at
once
prepared
to
reënforce
it
with
my
present
volunteer
force
increased
by
general
loring
after
repulsing
the
enemy
at
manassas
let
the
troops
that
marched
on
romney
return
to
the
valley
and
move
rapidly
westward
to
the
waters
of
the
monongahela
and
little
kanawha
should
general
kelley
be
defeated
and
especially
should
he
be
captured
i
believe
that
by
a
judicious
disposition
of
the
militia
a
few
cavalry
and
a
small
number
of
no
additional
forces
would
be
required
for
some
time
in
this
district
i
deem
it
of
very
great
importance
that
northwestern
virginia
be
occupied
by
confederate
troops
this
winter
at
present
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
enemy
are
not
expecting
an
attack
there
and
the
resources
of
that
region
necessary
for
the
subsistence
of
our
troops
are
in
greater
abundance
than
in
almost
any
other
season
of
the
year
postpone
the
occupation
of
that
section
until
spring
and
we
may
expect
to
find
the
enemy
prepared
for
us
and
the
resources
to
which
i
have
referred
greatly
exhausted
i
know
that
what
i
have
proposed
will
be
an
arduous
undertaking
and
can
not
be
accomplished
without
the
sacrifice
of
much
personal
comfort
but
i
feel
that
the
troops
will
be
prepared
to
make
this
sacrifice
when
animated
by
the
prospects
of
important
results
to
our
cause
and
distinction
to
themselves
it
may
be
urged
against
this
plan
that
the
enemy
will
advance
on
staunton
or
huntersville
i
am
well
satisfied
that
such
a
step
would
but
make
their
destruction
more
certain
again
it
may
be
said
that
general
floyd
will
be
cut
off
to
avoid
this
if
necessary
the
general
has
only
to
fall
back
toward
the
virginia
and
tennessee
railroad
when
northwestern
virginia
is
occupied
in
force
the
kanawha
valley
unless
it
be
the
lower
part
of
it
must
be
evacuated
by
the
federal
forces
or
otherwise
their
safety
will
be
endangered
by
forcing
a
column
across
from
the
little
kanawha
between
them
and
the
ohio
river
admitting
that
the
season
is
too
far
advanced
or
that
from
other
causes
all
can
not
be
accomplished
that
has
been
named
yet
through
the
blessing
of
god
who
has
thus
far
so
wonderfully
prospered
our
cause
much
more
may
be
expected
from
general
loring
troops
according
to
this
programme
than
can
be
expected
from
them
where
they
are
if
you
decide
to
order
them
here
i
trust
that
for
the
purpose
of
saving
time
all
the
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
will
be
directed
to
move
immediately
upon
the
reception
of
the
order
the
enemy
about
five
thousand
strong
have
been
for
some
time
slightly
fortifying
at
romney
and
have
completed
their
telegraph
from
that
place
to
green
spring
depot
their
forces
at
and
near
williamsport
are
estimated
as
high
as
five
thousand
but
as
yet
i
have
no
reliable
information
of
their
strength
beyond
the
potomac
your
most
obedient
servant
jackson
headquarters
centreville
respectfully
forwarded
i
submit
that
the
troops
under
general
loring
might
render
valuable
services
by
taking
the
field
with
general
jackson
instead
of
going
into
as
now
proposed
johnston
headquarters
centreville
general
cooper
and
sir
i
have
received
jackson
plan
of
operations
in
his
district
for
which
he
asks
for
reënforcements
it
seems
to
me
that
he
proposes
more
than
can
well
be
accomplished
in
that
high
mountainous
country
at
this
season
if
the
means
of
driving
the
enemy
from
romney
preventing
the
reconstruction
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
incursions
by
marauders
into
the
counties
of
jefferson
berkeley
and
morgan
can
be
supplied
to
general
jackson
and
with
them
those
objects
accomplished
we
shall
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
so
far
as
the
valley
district
is
concerned
the
wants
of
other
portions
of
the
frontier
acquia
district
for
instance
make
it
inexpedient
in
my
opinion
to
transfer
to
the
valley
district
so
large
a
force
as
that
asked
for
by
jackson
it
seems
to
me
to
be
now
of
especial
importance
to
strengthen
holmes
near
acquia
creek
the
force
there
is
very
small
compared
with
the
importance
of
the
position
your
obedient
servant
johnston
endorsement
respectfully
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
war
cooper
and
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
sir
the
secretary
of
war
has
this
morning
laid
before
me
yours
of
the
instant
i
fully
sympathize
with
your
anxiety
for
the
army
of
the
potomac
if
indeed
mine
be
less
than
yours
it
can
only
be
so
because
the
south
the
west
and
the
east
presenting
like
cause
for
solicitude
have
in
the
same
manner
demanded
my
care
our
correspondence
must
have
assured
you
that
i
fully
concur
in
your
view
of
the
necessity
for
unity
in
command
and
i
hope
by
a
statement
of
the
case
to
convince
you
that
there
has
been
no
purpose
to
divide
your
authority
by
transferring
the
troops
specified
in
order
no
from
the
center
to
the
left
of
your
department
the
active
campaign
in
the
greenbrier
region
was
considered
as
closed
for
the
season
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
enemy
is
moving
a
portion
of
his
forces
from
that
toward
the
valley
of
virginia
and
that
he
has
sent
troops
and
munitions
from
the
east
by
the
way
of
the
potomac
canal
toward
the
same
point
the
failure
to
destroy
his
communications
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
by
the
potomac
canal
has
left
him
in
possession
of
great
advantages
for
that
operation
general
jackson
for
reasons
known
to
you
was
selected
to
command
the
division
of
the
valley
but
we
had
only
the
militia
and
one
mounted
regiment
within
the
district
assigned
to
him
the
recent
activity
of
the
enemy
the
capture
of
romney
required
that
he
should
have
for
prompt
service
a
body
of
confederate
troops
to
coöperate
with
the
militia
of
that
district
you
suggest
that
such
force
should
be
drawn
from
the
army
at
the
greenbrier
this
was
originally
considered
and
abandoned
because
they
could
not
reach
him
in
time
to
anticipate
the
enemy
concentration
and
also
because
general
jackson
was
a
stranger
to
them
and
time
was
wanting
for
the
growth
of
that
confidence
between
the
commander
and
his
troops
the
value
of
which
need
not
be
urged
upon
you
we
could
have
sent
to
him
from
this
place
an
equal
number
of
regiments
being
about
double
the
numerical
strength
of
those
specified
in
the
order
referred
to
but
they
were
parts
of
a
brigade
now
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
or
were
southern
troops
and
were
ignorant
of
the
country
in
which
they
were
to
serve
and
all
of
them
unknown
to
general
jackson
the
troops
sent
were
his
old
brigade
had
served
in
the
valley
and
had
acquired
a
reputation
which
would
give
confidence
to
the
people
of
that
region
upon
whom
the
general
had
to
rely
for
his
future
success
though
the
troops
sent
to
you
are
as
you
say
they
have
many
able
officers
and
will
i
doubt
not
be
found
reliable
in
the
hour
of
danger
their
greater
numbers
will
to
you
i
hope
more
than
compensate
for
the
experience
of
those
transferred
while
in
the
valley
the
latter
by
the
moral
effect
their
presence
will
produce
will
more
than
compensate
for
the
inferiority
of
their
numbers
i
have
labored
to
increase
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
so
far
from
proposing
a
reduction
of
it
did
not
intend
to
rest
content
with
an
exchange
of
equivalents
in
addition
to
the
troops
recently
sent
to
you
i
expected
soon
to
send
further
reënforcements
by
withdrawing
a
part
of
the
army
from
the
greenbrier
mountains
i
have
looked
hopefully
forward
to
the
time
when
our
army
could
assume
the
offensive
and
select
the
time
and
place
where
battles
were
to
be
fought
so
that
ours
should
be
alternations
of
activity
and
repose
theirs
the
heavy
task
of
constant
watching
when
i
last
visited
your
headquarters
my
surprise
was
expressed
at
the
little
increase
of
your
effective
force
above
that
of
the
of
july
last
notwithstanding
the
heavy
reënforcements
which
in
the
mean
time
had
been
sent
to
you
since
that
visit
i
have
frequently
heard
of
the
improved
health
of
the
troops
of
the
return
of
many
who
had
been
absent
sick
and
some
increase
has
been
made
by
reënforcements
you
can
then
imagine
my
disappointment
at
the
information
you
give
that
on
the
day
before
the
date
of
your
letter
the
army
at
your
position
was
yet
no
stronger
than
on
the
of
july
i
can
only
repeat
what
has
been
said
to
you
in
our
conference
at
fairfax
that
we
are
restricted
in
our
capacity
to
reënforce
by
the
want
of
arms
troops
to
bear
the
few
arms
you
have
in
store
have
been
ordered
forward
your
view
of
the
magnitude
of
the
calamity
of
defeat
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
is
entirely
concurred
in
and
every
advantage
which
is
attainable
should
be
seized
to
increase
the
power
of
your
present
force
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
augment
its
numbers
but
you
must
remember
that
our
wants
greatly
exceed
our
resources
banks
brigade
we
learn
has
left
the
position
occupied
when
i
last
saw
you
sickles
is
said
to
be
yet
in
the
lower
potomac
and
when
your
means
will
enable
you
to
reach
him
i
still
hope
he
may
be
crushed
i
will
show
this
reply
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
hope
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding
between
you
in
future
the
success
of
the
army
requires
harmonious
coöperation
very
respectfully
jefferson
davis
after
general
jackson
commenced
his
march
the
cold
became
unexpectedly
severe
and
as
he
ascended
into
the
mountainous
region
the
slopes
were
covered
with
ice
which
impeded
his
progress
the
more
because
his
horses
were
but
his
tenacity
of
purpose
fidelity
and
daring
too
well
known
to
need
commendation
triumphed
over
every
obstacle
and
he
attained
his
object
drove
the
enemy
from
romney
and
its
surroundings
took
possession
of
the
place
and
prevented
the
threatened
concentration
having
accomplished
this
purpose
and
being
assured
that
the
enemy
had
abandoned
that
section
of
country
he
returned
with
his
old
brigade
to
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
leaving
the
balance
of
his
command
at
romney
general
loring
the
senior
officer
there
present
and
many
others
of
the
command
so
left
appealed
to
the
war
department
to
be
withdrawn
their
arguments
were
as
well
as
i
remember
these
that
the
troops
being
from
the
south
were
unaccustomed
to
and
unprepared
for
the
rigors
of
a
mountain
winter
that
they
were
strangers
to
the
people
of
that
section
that
the
position
had
no
military
strength
and
at
the
approach
of
spring
would
be
accessible
to
the
enemy
by
roads
leading
from
various
quarters
after
some
preliminary
action
an
order
was
issued
from
the
war
office
directing
the
troops
to
retire
to
the
valley
as
that
order
has
been
the
subject
of
no
little
complaint
both
by
civil
and
military
functionaries
my
letter
to
the
general
commanding
the
department
in
explanation
of
the
act
of
the
secretary
of
war
is
hereto
annexed
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
department
of
northern
virginia
centreville
general
i
have
received
your
letter
of
the
instant
while
i
admit
the
propriety
in
all
cases
of
transmitting
orders
through
you
to
those
under
your
command
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
secretary
of
war
should
in
a
case
requiring
prompt
action
have
departed
from
this
the
usual
method
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
failed
more
than
once
in
having
his
instructions
carried
out
when
forwarded
to
you
in
the
proper
manner
you
will
remember
that
you
were
directed
on
account
of
the
painful
reports
received
at
the
war
department
in
relation
to
the
command
at
romney
to
repair
to
that
place
and
after
the
needful
examination
to
give
the
orders
proper
in
the
case
you
sent
your
inspector
general
and
i
am
informed
that
he
went
no
farther
than
winchester
to
which
point
the
commander
of
the
expedition
had
withdrawn
leaving
the
troops
for
whom
anxiety
had
been
excited
at
romney
had
you
given
your
personal
attention
to
the
case
you
must
be
assured
that
the
confidence
reposed
in
you
would
have
prevented
the
secretary
from
taking
any
action
before
your
report
had
been
received
in
the
absence
of
such
security
he
was
further
moved
by
what
was
deemed
reliable
information
that
a
large
force
of
the
enemy
was
concentrating
to
capture
the
troops
at
romney
and
by
official
report
that
place
had
no
natural
strength
and
little
strategic
importance
to
insure
concert
of
action
in
the
defense
of
our
potomac
frontier
it
was
thought
best
to
place
all
the
forces
for
this
object
under
one
command
the
reasons
which
originally
induced
the
adding
of
the
valley
district
to
your
department
exist
in
full
force
at
present
and
i
can
not
therefore
agree
to
its
separation
from
your
command
i
will
visit
the
army
of
the
potomac
as
soon
as
other
engagements
will
permit
although
i
can
not
realize
your
complimentary
assurance
that
great
good
to
the
army
will
result
from
it
nor
can
i
anticipate
the
precise
time
when
it
will
be
practicable
to
leave
my
duties
here
very
respectfully
and
truly
yours
jefferson
davis
to
complaints
by
general
johnston
that
the
discipline
of
his
army
was
interfered
with
by
irregular
action
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
its
numerical
strength
diminished
by
furloughs
granted
directly
by
the
war
department
i
replied
after
making
inquiry
at
the
war
office
by
a
letter
a
copy
of
which
is
hereto
annexed
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
dear
sir
yours
of
the
instant
received
prompt
attention
and
i
am
led
to
the
conclusion
that
some
imposition
has
been
practiced
upon
you
the
secretary
of
war
informs
me
that
he
has
not
granted
leaves
of
absence
or
furloughs
to
soldiers
of
your
command
for
a
month
past
and
then
only
to
divert
the
current
which
threatened
by
legislation
to
destroy
your
army
by
a
wholesale
system
of
furloughs
those
which
you
inform
me
are
daily
received
must
be
spurious
the
authority
to
reënlist
and
change
from
infantry
to
artillery
the
secretary
informs
me
has
been
given
but
in
four
cases
three
on
the
recommendation
of
general
beauregard
and
specially
explained
to
you
some
time
since
the
remaining
case
was
that
of
a
company
from
wheeling
which
was
regarded
as
an
exceptional
one
i
wish
therefore
that
you
would
send
to
the
the
cases
of
recent
date
in
which
the
discipline
of
your
troops
has
been
interfered
with
in
the
two
methods
stated
so
that
an
inquiry
may
be
made
into
the
origin
of
the
papers
presented
the
law
in
relation
to
reënlistment
provides
for
reorganization
and
was
under
the
policy
of
electing
the
officers
the
concession
to
army
opinions
was
limited
to
the
promotion
by
seniority
after
the
organization
of
the
companies
and
regiments
had
been
completed
the
reorganization
was
not
to
occur
before
the
expiration
of
the
present
term
a
subsequent
law
provides
for
filling
up
the
twelve
months
companies
by
recruits
for
the
war
but
the
organization
ceases
with
the
term
of
the
twelve
months
men
be
assured
of
readiness
to
protect
your
proper
authority
and
i
do
but
justice
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
saying
that
he
can
not
desire
to
interfere
with
the
discipline
and
organization
of
your
troops
he
has
complained
that
his
orders
are
not
executed
and
i
regret
that
he
was
able
to
present
to
me
so
many
instances
to
justify
that
complaint
which
were
in
no
wise
the
invasion
of
your
prerogative
as
a
commander
in
the
field
you
can
command
my
attention
at
all
times
to
any
matter
connected
with
your
duties
and
i
hope
that
full
will
secure
full
satisfaction
very
truly
yours
jefferson
davis
a
fortnight
after
this
letter
i
received
from
general
johnston
notice
that
his
position
was
considered
unsafe
many
of
his
letters
to
me
have
been
lost
and
i
have
thus
far
not
been
able
to
find
the
one
giving
the
notice
referred
to
but
the
reply
which
is
annexed
clearly
indicates
the
substance
of
the
letter
which
was
answered
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
your
opinion
that
your
position
may
be
turned
whenever
the
enemy
chooses
to
advance
and
that
he
will
be
ready
to
take
the
field
before
yourself
clearly
indicates
prompt
effort
to
disencumber
yourself
of
everything
which
would
interfere
with
your
rapid
movement
when
necessary
and
such
thorough
examination
of
the
country
in
your
rear
as
would
give
you
exact
knowledge
of
its
roads
and
general
topography
and
enable
you
to
select
a
line
of
greater
natural
advantages
than
that
now
occupied
by
your
forces
the
heavy
guns
at
manassas
and
evansport
needed
elsewhere
and
reported
to
be
useless
in
their
present
position
would
necessarily
be
abandoned
in
any
hasty
retreat
i
regret
that
you
find
it
impossible
to
move
them
the
subsistence
stores
should
when
removed
be
placed
in
positions
to
answer
your
future
wants
those
can
not
be
determined
until
you
have
furnished
definite
information
as
to
your
plans
especially
the
line
to
which
you
would
remove
in
the
contingency
of
retiring
the
had
previously
stopped
further
shipments
to
your
army
and
given
satisfactory
reasons
for
the
establishment
at
thoroughfare
i
need
not
urge
on
your
consideration
the
value
to
our
country
of
arms
and
munitions
of
war
you
know
the
difficulty
with
which
we
have
obtained
our
small
supply
that
to
furnish
heavy
artillery
to
the
advanced
posts
we
have
exhausted
the
supplies
here
which
were
designed
for
the
armament
of
the
city
defenses
whatever
can
be
should
be
done
to
avoid
the
loss
of
these
guns
as
has
been
my
custom
i
have
only
sought
to
present
general
purposes
and
views
i
rely
upon
your
special
knowledge
and
high
ability
to
effect
whatever
is
practicable
in
this
our
hour
of
need
recent
disasters
have
depressed
the
weak
and
are
depriving
us
of
the
aid
of
the
wavering
traitors
show
the
tendencies
heretofore
concealed
and
the
selfish
grow
clamorous
for
local
and
personal
interests
at
such
an
hour
the
wisdom
of
the
trained
and
the
steadiness
of
the
brave
possess
a
double
value
the
military
paradox
that
impossibilities
must
be
rendered
possible
had
never
better
occasion
for
its
application
the
engineers
for
whom
you
asked
have
been
ordered
to
report
to
you
and
further
additions
will
be
made
to
your
list
of
let
me
hear
from
you
often
and
fully
very
truly
and
respectfully
yours
jefferson
davis
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
notwithstanding
the
threatening
position
of
the
enemy
i
infer
from
your
account
of
the
roads
and
streams
that
his
active
operations
must
be
for
some
time
delayed
and
thus
i
am
permitted
to
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
mobilize
your
army
by
the
removal
of
your
heavy
ordnance
and
such
stores
as
are
not
required
for
active
operations
so
that
whenever
you
are
required
to
move
it
may
be
without
public
loss
and
without
impediment
to
celerity
i
was
fully
impressed
with
the
difficulties
which
you
presented
when
discussing
the
subject
of
a
change
of
position
to
preserve
the
efficiency
of
your
army
you
will
of
course
avoid
all
needless
exposure
and
when
your
army
has
been
relieved
of
all
useless
encumbrance
you
can
have
no
occasion
to
move
it
while
the
roads
and
the
weather
are
such
as
would
involve
serious
suffering
because
the
same
reasons
must
restrain
the
operations
of
the
enemy
very
respectfully
yours
jefferson
davis
at
the
conference
at
fairfax
heretofore
referred
to
i
was
sadly
disappointed
to
find
that
the
strength
of
that
army
had
been
little
increased
notwithstanding
the
reënforcements
sent
to
it
since
the
of
july
and
that
to
make
an
advance
the
generals
required
an
additional
force
which
it
was
utterly
impracticable
for
me
to
supply
soon
thereafter
the
army
withdrew
to
centreville
a
better
position
for
defense
but
not
for
attack
and
thereby
suggestive
of
the
abandonment
of
an
intention
to
advance
the
subsequent
correspondence
with
general
johnston
during
the
winter
expressed
an
expectation
that
the
enemy
would
resume
the
offensive
and
that
the
position
then
held
was
geographically
unfavorable
there
was
a
general
apprehension
at
richmond
that
the
northern
frontier
of
virginia
would
be
abandoned
and
a
corresponding
earnestness
was
exhibited
to
raise
the
requisite
force
to
enable
our
army
to
take
the
offensive
on
the
of
march
i
telegraphed
to
general
johnston
further
assurance
given
to
me
this
day
that
you
shall
be
promptly
and
adequately
reënforced
so
as
to
enable
you
to
maintain
your
position
and
resume
first
policy
when
the
roads
will
permit
the
first
policy
was
to
carry
the
war
beyond
our
own
border
five
days
thereafter
i
received
notice
that
our
army
was
in
retreat
and
replied
as
follows
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
army
of
the
general
i
have
received
your
letter
of
the
instant
giving
the
first
official
account
i
have
received
of
the
retrograde
movement
of
your
army
your
letter
would
lead
me
to
infer
that
others
had
been
sent
to
apprise
me
of
your
plans
and
movements
if
so
they
have
not
reached
me
and
before
the
receipt
of
yours
of
the
i
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
to
your
purposes
condition
and
necessities
as
at
the
time
of
our
conversation
on
the
subject
about
a
month
since
it
is
true
i
have
had
many
and
alarming
reports
of
great
destruction
of
ammunition
and
provisions
indicating
precipitate
retreat
but
having
heard
of
no
cause
for
such
a
sudden
movement
i
was
at
a
loss
to
believe
it
i
have
not
the
requisite
topographical
knowledge
for
the
selection
of
your
new
position
i
had
intended
that
you
should
determine
that
question
and
for
this
purpose
a
corps
of
engineers
was
furnished
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
country
to
aid
you
in
your
decision
the
question
of
throwing
troops
into
richmond
is
contingent
upon
reverses
in
the
west
and
southeast
the
immediate
necessity
for
such
a
movement
is
not
anticipated
very
respectfully
yours
jefferson
davis
on
the
same
day
i
sent
the
following
telegram
richmond
virginia
general
johnston
your
letter
of
the
received
this
day
being
the
first
information
of
your
retrograde
movement
i
have
no
report
of
your
reconnaissance
and
can
suggest
nothing
as
to
the
position
you
should
take
except
it
should
be
as
far
in
advance
as
consistent
with
your
safety
jefferson
davis
to
further
inquiry
from
general
johnston
as
to
where
he
should
take
position
i
replied
that
i
would
go
to
his
headquarters
in
the
field
and
found
him
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
to
which
he
had
retired
in
a
position
possessing
great
natural
advantages
an
elevated
bank
commanded
the
north
side
of
the
river
overlooking
the
bridge
and
an
open
field
beyond
it
across
which
the
enemy
must
pass
to
reach
the
bridge
which
if
left
standing
was
an
invitation
to
seek
that
crossing
upon
inquiring
whether
the
south
bank
of
the
river
continued
to
command
the
other
side
down
to
fredericksburg
general
johnston
answered
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
not
been
at
fredericksburg
since
he
passed
there
in
a
stage
on
his
way
to
west
point
when
he
was
first
appointed
a
cadet
i
then
proposed
that
we
should
go
to
fredericksburg
to
inform
ourselves
upon
that
point
on
arriving
at
fredericksburg
a
reconnaissance
soon
manifested
that
the
hills
on
the
opposite
side
commanded
the
town
and
adjacent
and
therefore
fredericksburg
could
only
be
defended
by
an
army
occupying
the
opposite
hills
for
which
our
force
was
inadequate
in
returning
to
the
house
of
barton
where
i
was
a
guest
i
found
a
number
of
ladies
had
assembled
there
to
welcome
me
and
who
with
anxiety
inquired
as
to
the
result
of
our
reconnaissance
upon
learning
that
the
town
was
not
considered
defensible
against
an
enemy
occupying
the
heights
on
the
other
side
and
that
our
force
was
not
sufficient
to
hold
those
heights
against
such
an
attack
as
might
be
anticipated
the
general
answer
was
with
a
patriotism
too
much
admired
to
be
forgotten
if
the
good
of
our
cause
requires
the
defense
of
the
town
to
be
abandoned
let
it
be
done
the
purposes
of
the
enemy
were
then
unknown
to
us
if
general
johnston
expectation
of
a
hostile
advance
in
great
force
should
be
realized
our
course
must
depend
partly
upon
receiving
the
reënforcement
we
had
reason
to
expect
from
promises
previously
given
and
renewed
as
was
announced
to
general
johnston
in
my
telegram
of
of
march
in
these
words
further
assurance
given
to
me
this
day
that
you
shall
be
promptly
and
adequately
reënforced
so
as
to
enable
you
to
maintain
your
position
and
resume
first
policy
when
the
roads
will
permit
no
immediate
decision
could
therefore
be
made
and
i
returned
to
richmond
to
wait
the
further
development
of
the
enemy
plans
and
to
prepare
as
best
we
might
to
counteract
them
the
feeling
heretofore
noticed
as
arousing
in
virginia
a
determination
to
resist
the
abandonment
of
her
northern
frontier
and
which
caused
the
assurance
of
reënforcements
bore
fruit
in
the
addition
of
about
thirty
thousand
men
by
a
draft
made
by
the
governor
of
the
state
these
it
is
true
were
not
the
disciplined
seasoned
troops
which
were
asked
for
by
the
generals
in
the
conference
at
fairfax
but
they
were
of
such
men
as
often
during
the
war
won
battles
for
the
confederacy
the
development
of
the
enemy
plans
for
which
we
had
to
wait
proved
that
instead
of
advancing
in
force
against
our
position
at
centreville
he
had
before
the
retreat
of
our
army
commenced
decided
to
move
down
the
potomac
for
a
campaign
against
richmond
from
the
peninsula
as
a
base
the
conflagration
at
centreville
gave
notice
of
its
evacuation
and
an
advance
was
made
as
far
as
manassas
but
as
appears
by
general
mcclellan
report
with
no
more
important
design
than
to
attack
our
rear
guard
if
it
should
be
encountered
in
the
report
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
by
a
committee
of
the
united
states
congress
evidence
is
found
of
much
vacillation
before
the
conclusion
was
finally
reached
of
abandoning
the
idea
of
a
direct
advance
upon
richmond
for
that
of
concentrating
their
army
at
the
mouth
of
the
chesapeake
whatever
doubt
or
apprehension
continued
to
exist
about
uncovering
the
city
of
washington
by
removing
their
main
army
from
before
it
was
of
course
dispelled
by
the
retreat
of
our
army
and
the
burning
of
bridges
behind
it
in
this
fact
general
mcclellan
says
he
found
the
strongest
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
our
army
returning
there
was
an
apparent
advantage
to
the
enemy
in
the
new
base
for
his
operations
which
was
sufficiently
illustrated
by
the
events
of
the
last
year
of
the
war
had
we
possessed
an
army
as
large
as
the
enemy
supposed
it
would
have
been
possible
for
us
at
the
same
time
to
check
his
advance
from
the
east
and
to
march
against
his
capital
with
fair
prospect
of
capturing
it
before
the
army
he
had
sent
against
yorktown
could
have
been
brought
back
for
the
defense
of
washington
on
this
as
on
other
occasions
he
greatly
magnified
the
force
we
possessed
and
on
this
as
on
other
occasions
it
required
the
concentration
of
our
troops
successfully
to
resist
a
detachment
of
his
accepting
as
a
necessity
the
withdrawal
of
the
main
portion
of
our
army
from
northern
virginia
to
meet
the
invasion
from
the
seaboard
it
was
regretted
that
earlier
and
more
effective
means
were
not
employed
for
the
mobilization
of
the
army
a
desirable
measure
in
either
contingency
of
advance
or
retreat
or
at
the
least
that
the
withdrawal
was
not
so
deliberate
as
to
secure
the
removal
of
our
ordnance
subsistence
and
quartermasters
stores
which
had
been
collected
on
the
line
occupied
in
and
the
early
part
of
a
distinguished
officer
of
our
army
who
has
since
the
war
made
valuable
contributions
to
the
history
of
its
operations
especially
valuable
as
well
for
their
accuracy
as
for
their
freedom
from
personal
or
partisan
bias
writes
thus
of
the
retreat
from
centreville
a
very
large
amount
of
stores
and
provisions
had
been
abandoned
for
want
of
transportation
and
among
the
stores
was
a
very
large
quantity
of
clothing
blankets
which
had
been
provided
by
the
states
south
of
virginia
for
their
own
troops
the
pile
of
trunks
along
the
railroad
was
appalling
to
behold
all
these
stores
clothing
trunks
were
consigned
to
the
flames
by
a
portion
of
our
cavalry
left
to
carry
out
the
work
of
their
destruction
the
loss
of
stores
at
this
point
and
at
white
plains
on
the
manassas
gap
railroad
where
a
large
amount
of
meat
had
been
salted
and
stored
was
a
very
serious
one
to
us
and
embarrassed
us
for
the
remainder
of
the
war
as
it
put
us
at
once
on
a
running
stock
the
same
officer
and
the
value
of
his
opinion
will
be
recognized
by
all
who
know
him
wherefore
i
give
his
name
general
j
a
early
in
a
communication
subsequent
to
that
from
which
i
have
just
quoted
writes
in
regard
to
the
loss
of
supplies
i
believe
that
all
might
have
been
carried
off
from
manassas
if
the
railroads
had
been
energetically
operated
the
of
the
orange
and
alexandria
manassas
gap
and
virginia
central
railroads
ought
to
have
been
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
removing
everything
in
the
two
weeks
allowed
if
properly
used
the
enemy
plans
the
development
of
which
as
has
been
already
stated
was
necessary
for
the
determination
of
our
own
movements
were
soon
thereafter
found
to
be
the
invasion
of
virginia
from
the
seaboard
and
the
principal
portion
of
our
army
was
consequently
ordered
to
the
peninsula
between
the
york
river
and
the
james
thus
the
northern
frontier
of
virginia
which
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
had
been
the
main
field
of
skirmishes
combats
and
battles
of
advance
and
retreat
and
the
occupation
and
evacuation
of
fortified
positions
ceased
for
a
time
to
tremble
beneath
the
tread
of
contending
armies
to
the
foregoing
narration
of
events
immediately
connected
with
the
efforts
of
the
confederate
government
to
maintain
its
existence
at
home
may
here
be
properly
added
an
incident
bearing
on
its
foreign
relations
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
our
efforts
for
the
recognition
of
the
confederate
states
by
the
european
powers
in
served
to
make
us
better
known
abroad
to
awaken
a
kindly
feeling
in
our
favor
and
cause
a
respectful
regard
for
the
effort
we
were
making
to
maintain
the
independence
of
the
states
which
great
britain
had
recognized
and
her
people
knew
to
be
our
birthright
on
the
of
november
an
outrage
was
perpetrated
by
an
armed
vessel
of
the
united
states
in
the
forcible
detention
on
the
of
a
british
mail
steamer
making
one
of
her
regular
trips
from
one
british
port
to
another
and
the
seizure
on
that
unarmed
vessel
of
our
commissioners
mason
and
slidell
who
with
their
secretaries
were
bound
for
europe
on
diplomatic
service
the
seizure
was
made
by
an
armed
force
against
the
protest
of
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
of
commander
williams
the
latter
speaking
as
the
representative
of
her
majesty
government
the
commissioners
only
yielded
when
force
which
they
could
not
resist
was
used
to
remove
them
from
the
and
convey
them
to
the
united
states
vessel
of
war
this
outrage
was
the
more
marked
because
the
united
states
had
been
foremost
in
resisting
the
right
of
visit
and
search
and
had
made
it
the
cause
of
the
war
of
with
great
britain
when
intelligence
of
the
event
was
received
in
england
it
excited
the
greatest
indignation
among
the
people
and
her
majesty
government
by
naval
and
other
preparations
unmistakably
exhibited
the
purpose
to
redress
the
wrong
the
commissioners
and
their
secretaries
had
been
transported
to
the
harbor
of
boston
and
imprisoned
in
its
main
fortress
diplomatic
correspondence
resulted
from
this
event
the
british
government
demanded
the
immediate
and
unconditional
release
of
the
commissioners
in
order
that
they
may
again
be
placed
under
british
protection
and
a
suitable
apology
for
the
aggression
which
has
been
committed

the
mean
time

the

from

about
ten

rifles
and
carbines
at

arkansas
there
were
a
few
thousand

and
a

at

increasing
the

of

arms
to
about
one
hundred
and
thousand
add
to
these
the
arms
owned
by
the
several
states
and
by

and
it
would
make
a
total
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
for
the
use
of
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
the
rifles
were
of
the
caliber
known
as
mississippi
rifles
except
those
at
richmond
taken
from
harper
ferry
which
were
of
the
caliber
the
muskets
were
the
old
flint
lock
caliber
altered
to
percussion
there
were
a
few
boxes
of
sabers
at
each
arsenal
and
some
short
a
few
hundred
were
scattered
about
there
were
no
revolvers
there
was
before
the
war
little
powder
or
ammunition
of
any
kind
stored
in
the
southern
states
and
this
was
a
relic
of
the
war
with
mexico
it
is
doubtful
if
there
were
a
million
of
rounds
of
cartridges
the
chief
store
of
powder
was
that
captured
at
norfolk
there
was
besides
a
small
quantity
at
each
of
the
southern
arsenals
in
all
sixty
thousand
pounds
chiefly
old
the
did
not
exceed
one
quarter
of
a
million
and
there
was
no
lead
on
hand
there
were
no
batteries
of
serviceable
at
the
arsenals
but
a
few
old
iron
guns
mounted
on
gribeauval
carriages
fabricated
about
the
states
and
the
volunteer
companies
did
however
possess
some
serviceable
batteries
but
there
were
neither
harness
saddles
bridles
blankets
nor
other
artillery
or
cavalry
equipments
to
furnish
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
on
both
sides
of
the
mississippi
in
may
there
were
no
infantry
accoutrements
no
cavalry
arms
or
equipments
no
artillery
and
above
all
no
ammunition
nothing
save
arms
and
these
almost
wholly
the
old
pattern
muskets
altered
to
percussion
from
flint
locks
within
the
limits
of
the
confederate
states
the
arsenals
had
been
used
only
as
depots
and
no
one
of
them
except
that
at
fayetteville
north
carolina
had
a
single
machine
above
the
grade
of
a
except
at
harper
ferry
armory
all
the
work
of
preparation
of
material
had
been
carried
on
at
the
north
not
an
arm
not
a
gun
not
a
and
except
during
the
mexican
war
scarcely
a
round
of
ammunition
had
for
fifty
years
been
prepared
in
the
confederate
states
there
were
consequently
no
workmen
or
very
few
skilled
in
these
arts
powder
save
perhaps
for
blasting
had
not
been
made
at
the
south
no
saltpeter
was
in
store
at
any
southern
point
it
was
stored
wholly
at
the
north
there
were
no
worked
mines
of
lead
except
in
virginia
and
the
situation
of
those
made
them
a
precarious
dependence
the
only
existing
was
at
richmond
copper
so
necessary
for
and
for
was
just
being
obtained
in
east
tennessee
there
was
no
for
south
of
richmond
and
but
few
and
these
with
trifling
exceptions
were
in
the
border
states
of
virginia
and
tennessee
the
first
efforts
made
to
obtain
powder
were
by
orders
sent
to
the
north
which
had
been
early
done
both
by
the
confederate
government
and
by
some
of
the
states
these
were
being
rapidly
filled
when
the
attack
was
made
on
fort
sumter
the
shipments
then
ceased
niter
was
contemporaneously
sought
for
in
north
alabama
and
tennessee
between
four
and
five
hundred
tons
of
sulphur
were
obtained
in
new
orleans
at
which
place
it
had
been
imported
for
use
in
the
manufacture
of
sugar
preparations
for
the
construction
of
a
large
were
promptly
commenced
by
the
government
and
two
small
private
mills
in
east
tennessee
were
supervised
and
improved
on
june
there
was
probably
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
only
chiefly
of
and
about
as
much
niter
which
had
been
imported
by
georgia
there
were
the
two
above
mentioned
but
we
had
no
experience
in
making
powder
or
in
extracting
niter
from
natural
deposits
or
in
obtaining
it
by
artificial
beds
for
the
supply
of
arms
an
agent
was
sent
to
europe
who
made
contracts
to
the
extent
of
nearly
half
a
million
dollars
some
had
been
obtained
from
the
north
and
also
important
machinery
the
machinery
at
harper
ferry
armory
had
been
saved
from
the
flames
by
the
heroic
conduct
of
the
operatives
headed
by
armistead
ball
the
master
armorer
of
the
machinery
so
saved
that
for
making
was
transported
to
richmond
and
that
for
rifles
with
to
fayetteville
north
carolina
in
addition
to
the
injuries
suffered
by
the
machinery
the
lack
of
skilled
workmen
caused
much
embarrassment
in
the
mean
time
the
manufacture
of
was
undertaken
at
new
orleans
and
prosecuted
with
energy
though
with
limited
success
in
the
manufacture
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
tredegar
works
in
richmond
some
castings
were
made
in
new
orleans
and
attention
was
turned
to
the
manufacture
of
field
and
siege
artillery
at
nashville
a
small
foundry
at
rome
georgia
was
induced
to
undertake
the
casting
of
the
iron
rifle
but
the
progress
was
very
slow
the
state
of
virginia
possessed
a
number
of
old
iron
guns
which
were
reamed
out
to
get
a
good
bore
and
rifled
with
three
grooves
after
the
manner
of
parrott
the
army
at
harper
ferry
and
that
at
manassas
were
supplied
with
old
batteries
of
guns
and
howitzers
a
few
parrott
guns
purchased
by
the
state
of
virginia
were
with
general
magruder
at
big
bethel
for
the
ammunition
and
equipment
required
for
the
infantry
and
artillery
a
good
laboratory
and
workshop
had
been
established
at
richmond
the
arsenals
were
making
preparations
for
furnishing
ammunition
and
knapsacks
but
generally
what
little
was
done
in
this
regard
was
for
local
purposes
such
was
the
general
condition
of
ordnance
and
ordnance
stores
in
may
the
progress
of
development
however
was
steady
a
refinery
of
saltpeter
was
established
near
nashville
during
the
summer
which
received
the
niter
from
its
vicinity
and
from
the
caves
in
east
and
middle
tennessee
some
inferior
powder
was
made
at
two
small
mills
in
south
carolina
north
carolina
established
a
mill
near
raleigh
and
a
was
put
up
near
new
orleans
and
powder
made
there
before
the
fall
of
the
city
small
quantities
were
also
received
through
the
blockade
it
was
estimated
that
on
january
there
were
fifteen
hundred
of
various
caliber
in
position
from
evansport
on
the
potomac
to
fort
brown
on
the
rio
grande
if
their
caliber
was
averaged
at
pounder
and
the
charge
at
five
pounds
it
would
at
forty
rounds
per
gun
require
six
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
powder
for
them
the
say
three
hundred
guns
with
two
hundred
rounds
to
the
piece
would
require
one
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
and
the
cartridges
say
ten
million
would
consume
one
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
more
making
in
all
eight
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
deducting
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
supposed
to
be
on
hand
in
various
shapes
and
the
increment
is
six
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
the
year
of
this
perhaps
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
had
been
made
at
the
tennessee
and
other
mills
leaving
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
be
supplied
through
the
blockade
or
before
the
beginning
of
hostilities
the
liability
of
powder
to
deteriorate
in
damp
atmospheres
results
from
the
impurity
of
the
niter
used
in
its
manufacture
and
this
it
is
not
possible
to
detect
by
any
of
the
usual
tests
security
therefore
in
the
purchase
depends
on
the
reliability
of
the
maker
to
us
who
had
to
rely
on
foreign
products
and
the
open
market
this
was
equivalent
to
no
security
at
all
it
was
therefore
as
well
for
this
reason
as
because
of
the
precariousness
of
thus
obtaining
the
requisite
supply
necessary
that
we
should
establish
a
government
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
have
a
valuable
man
whose
military
education
and
scientific
knowledge
had
been
supplemented
by
practical
experience
in
a
large
manufactory
of
machinery
he
general
rains
was
at
the
time
resident
in
the
state
of
new
york
but
when
his
native
state
north
carolina
seceded
from
the
union
and
joined
the
confederacy
true
to
the
highest
instincts
of
patriotism
he
returned
to
the
land
of
his
birth
and
only
asked
where
he
could
be
most
useful
the
expectations
which
his
reputation
justified
caused
him
to
be
assigned
to
the
task
of
making
a
great
which
should
alike
furnish
an
adequate
supply
and
give
assurance
of
its
possessing
all
the
requisite
qualities
this
problem
which
under
the
existing
circumstances
seemed
barely
possible
was
fully
solved
not
only
was
powder
made
of
every
variety
of
grain
and
exact
uniformity
in
each
but
the
niter
was
so
absolutely
purified
that
there
was
no
danger
of
its
deterioration
in
service
had
admiral
semmes
been
supplied
with
such
powder
it
is
demonstrated
by
the
facts
which
have
since
been
established
that
the
engagement
between
the
alabama
and
the
kearsarge
would
have
resulted
in
a
victory
for
the
former
these
government
were
located
at
augusta
georgia
and
satisfactory
progress
was
made
in
the
construction
during
the
year
all
the
machinery
including
the
very
heavy
rollers
was
made
in
the
confederate
states
contracts
were
made
abroad
for
the
delivery
of
niter
through
the
blockade
and
for
obtaining
it
immediately
we
resorted
to
caves
cellars
etc
the
amount
delivered
from
tennessee
was
the
largest
item
in
the
year
supply
but
the
whole
was
quite
inadequate
to
existing
and
prospective
needs
the
consumption
of
lead
was
mainly
met
by
the
virginia
at
wytheville
the
yield
from
which
was
from
sixty
to
eighty
thousand
pounds
per
month
lead
was
also
collected
by
agents
in
considerable
quantities
throughout
the
country
and
the
of
manassas
was
closely
gleaned
from
which
much
lead
was
collected
a
laboratory
for
the
smelting
of
other
ores
was
constructed
at
petersburg
virginia
and
was
in
operation
before
midsummer
of
by
the
close
of
eight
arsenals
and
four
depots
had
been
supplied
with
materials
and
machinery
so
as
to
be
efficient
in
producing
the
various
munitions
and
equipments
the
want
of
which
had
caused
early
embarrassment
thus
a
good
deal
had
been
done
to
produce
the
needed
material
of
war
and
to
refute
the
croakers
who
found
in
our
poverty
application
for
the
maxim
nihilo
nihil
the
troops
were
however
still
very
poorly
armed
and
equipped
the
old
musket
was
the
principal
weapon
of
the
infantry
the
artillery
had
mostly
the
gun
and
the
howitzer
and
the
cavalry
were
armed
with
such
various
weapons
as
they
could
get
sabers
revolvers
sharp
carbines
musketoons
short
enfield
rifles
holt
carbines
muskets
cut
off
etc
equipments
were
in
many
cases
made
of
stout
cotton
domestic
stitched
in
triple
folds
and
covered
with
paint
or
rubber
varnish
but
poor
as
were
the
arms
enough
of
them
such
as
they
were
could
not
be
obtained
to
arm
the
troops
pressing
forward
to
defend
their
homes
and
their
political
rights
in
december
arms
purchased
abroad
began
to
come
in
and
a
good
many
enfield
rifles
were
in
the
hands
of
the
troops
at
the
battle
of
shiloh
the
winter
of
was
the
period
when
our
ordnance
deficiencies
were
most
keenly
felt
powder
was
called
for
on
every
hand
and
the
equipments
most
needed
were
those
we
were
least
able
to
supply
the
abandonment
of
the
line
of
the
potomac
and
the
upper
mississippi
from
columbus
to
memphis
did
somewhat
however
the
pressure
for
heavy
artillery
and
after
the
fall
of
when
the
at
augusta
had
got
into
full
operation
there
was
no
further
inability
to
meet
all
requisitions
for
ammunition
to
provide
the
iron
needed
for
cannon
and
projectiles
it
had
been
necessary
to
stimulate
by
contracts
the
mining
and
smelting
of
its
ores
but
it
was
obviously
beyond
the
power
of
even
the
great
administrative
capacity
of
the
chief
of
ordnance
general
gorgas
to
whose
monograph
i
am
indebted
for
these
details
to
add
to
his
already
burdensome
labors
the
numerous
and
increasing
cares
of
obtaining
the
material
from
which
ammunition
arms
and
equipments
were
to
be
manufactured
on
his
recommendation
a
niter
and
mining
bureau
was
organized
and
colonel
john
who
had
been
hitherto
assigned
to
duty
in
connection
with
procuring
supplies
of
niter
and
iron
was
appointed
to
be
chief
of
this
bureau
a
large
difficult
and
most
important
field
of
operations
was
thus
assigned
to
him
and
well
did
he
fulfill
its
requirements
to
his
recent
experience
was
added
scientific
knowledge
and
to
both
untiring
systematic
industry
and
his
heart
thorough
devotion
to
the
cause
he
served
the
tree
is
known
by
its
fruit
and
he
may
confidently
point
to
results
as
the
evidence
on
which
he
is
willing
to
stand
for
judgment
briefly
they
will
be
noticed
niter
was
to
be
obtained
from
caves
and
other
like
sources
and
by
the
formation
of
some
of
which
had
previously
been
begun
at
richmond
these
beds
were
located
at
columbia
south
carolina
charleston
savannah
augusta
mobile
selma
and
various
other
points
at
the
close
of
there
were
two
million
eight
hundred
thousand
feet
of
earth
collected
and
in
various
stages
of
nitrification
of
which
a
large
proportion
was
presumed
to
yield
one
and
a
half
pound
of
niter
per
foot
of
earth
the
whole
country
was
laid
off
into
districts
each
of
which
was
under
the
charge
of
an
officer
who
obtained
details
of
workmen
from
the
army
and
made
his
monthly
reports
thus
the
niter
production
in
the
course
of
a
year
was
brought
up
to
something
like
half
of
the
total
consumption
the
district
from
which
the
most
constant
yield
could
be
relied
on
had
its
chief
office
at
greensboro
north
carolina
a
region
which
had
no
in
it
the
niter
was
obtained
from
lixiviation
of
nitrous
earth
found
under
old
houses
barns
etc
the
supervision
of
the
production
of
iron
lead
copper
and
all
the
minerals
which
needed
development
as
well
as
the
manufacture
of
sulphuric
and
nitric
acids
the
latter
required
for
the
supply
of
the
fulminate
of
mercury
for
without
which
the
firearms
of
our
day
would
have
been
useless
was
added
to
the
niter
bureau
such
was
the
progress
that
in
a
short
time
the
bureau
was
aiding
or
managing
some
twenty
to
thirty
furnaces
with
an
annual
yield
of
fifty
thousand
tons
or
more
of
the
and
works
erected
were
sufficient
for
all
wants
and
the
smelting
of
zinc
of
good
quality
had
been
achieved
the
chemical
works
were
placed
at
charlotte
north
carolina
to
serve
as
a
reserve
when
the
supply
from
abroad
might
be
cut
off
in
equipping
the
armies
first
sent
into
the
field
the
supply
of
accessories
was
embarrassingly
scant
there
were
arms
such
as
they
were
for
over
one
hundred
thousand
men
but
no
accoutrements
nor
equipments
and
a
meager
supply
of
ammunition
in
time
the
knapsacks
were
supplanted
by
haversacks
which
the
women
could
make
but
shoes
and
must
be
had
leather
was
also
needed
for
and
for
and
as
the
amount
of
leather
which
the
country
could
furnish
was
quite
insufficient
for
all
these
purposes
it
was
perforce
apportioned
among
them
soldiers
shoes
were
the
prime
necessity
therefore
a
scale
was
established
by
which
first
shoes
and
then
had
the
preference
after
these
and
then
saddles
and
bridles
to
economize
leather
the
waist
and
belts
were
made
of
prepared
cotton
cloth
stitched
in
stitched
in
three
or
four
thicknesses
were
likewise
so
made
and
then
were
thus
covered
except
the
flap
too
were
made
of
heavy
cotton
cloth
strongly
stitched
to
get
leather
each
department
procured
its
quota
of
hides
made
contracts
with
the
tanners
obtained
hands
for
them
by
exemptions
from
the
army
got
transportation
over
the
railroads
for
the
hides
and
for
supplies
to
the
varied
functions
of
this
bureau
was
finally
added
that
of
assisting
the
tanners
to
procure
the
necessary
supplies
for
the
tanneries
a
fishery
even
was
established
on
cape
fear
river
to
get
oil
for
mechanical
purposes
and
at
the
same
time
food
for
the
workmen
in
cavalry
equipments
the
main
thing
was
to
get
a
good
saddle
which
would
not
hurt
the
back
of
the
horse
for
this
purpose
various
patterns
were
tried
and
reasonable
success
was
obtained
one
of
the
most
difficult
wants
to
supply
in
this
branch
of
the
service
was
the
horseshoe
for
cavalry
and
artillery
the
want
of
iron
and
of
skilled
labor
was
strongly
felt
every
wayside
accessible
especially
those
in
and
near
the
theatre
of
operations
was
employed
these
again
had
to
be
supplied
with
material
and
the
employees
exempted
from
service
it
early
became
manifest
that
great
reliance
must
be
placed
on
the
introduction
of
articles
of
prime
necessity
through
the
blockaded
ports
a
vessel
capable
of
stowing
six
hundred
and
fifty
bales
of
cotton
was
purchased
by
the
agent
in
england
and
kept
running
between
bermuda
and
wilmington
some
fifteen
to
eighteen
successive
trips
were
made
before
she
was
captured
another
was
added
which
was
equally
successful
these
vessels
were
long
low
rather
narrow
and
built
for
speed
they
were
mostly
of
pale
and
with
their
lights
out
and
with
fuel
that
made
little
smoke
they
ran
to
and
from
wilmington
with
considerable
regularity
several
others
were
added
and
devoted
to
bringing
in
ordnance
and
finally
general
supplies
depots
of
stores
were
likewise
made
at
nassau
and
havana
another
organization
was
also
necessary
that
the
vessels
coming
in
through
the
blockade
might
have
their
return
cargoes
promptly
on
their
arrival
these
resources
were
also
supplemented
by
contracts
for
supplies
brought
through
texas
from
mexico
the
arsenal
in
richmond
soon
grew
into
very
large
dimensions
and
produced
all
the
ordnance
stores
that
the
army
required
except
cannon
and
in
quantities
sufficient
to
supply
the
forces
in
the
field
the
arsenal
at
augusta
was
very
serviceable
to
the
armies
serving
in
the
south
and
west
and
turned
out
a
good
deal
of
complete
the
government
were
entirely
successful
the
arsenal
and
workshops
at
charleston
were
enlarged
steam
introduced
and
good
work
done
in
various
departments
the
arsenal
at
mount
vernon
alabama
was
moved
to
selma
in
that
state
where
it
grew
into
a
large
and
establishment
of
the
first
class
mount
vernon
arsenal
was
dismantled
and
served
to
furnish
lumber
and
timber
for
use
elsewhere
at
montgomery
shops
were
kept
up
for
the
repair
of
and
the
manufacture
of
articles
of
leather
there
were
many
other
small
establishments
and
depots
the
chief
armories
were
at
richmond
and
fayetteville
north
carolina
the
former
turned
out
about
fifteen
hundred
stands
per
month
and
the
latter
only
four
hundred
per
month
for
want
of
operatives
to
meet
the
want
of
cavalry
arms
a
contract
was
made
for
the
construction
in
richmond
of
a
factory
for
sharp
carbines
this
being
built
it
was
then
converted
into
a
manufactory
of
caliber
smaller
establishments
grew
up
at
asheville
north
carolina
and
at
tallahassee
alabama
a
great
part
of
the
work
of
the
armories
consisted
in
the
repair
of
arms
in
this
manner
the
gleanings
of
the
were
utilized
nearly
ten
thousand
stands
were
saved
from
the
field
of
manassas
and
from
those
about
richmond
in
about
thousand
excellent
arms
all
the
stock
of
inferior
arms
disappeared
from
the
armories
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
and
were
replaced
by
a
better
class
of
arms
rifled
and
percussioned
placing
the
good
arms
lost
previous
to
july
at
one
hundred
thousand
there
must
have
been
received
from
various
sources
four
hundred
thousand
stands
of
infantry
arms
in
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
among
the
obvious
requirements
of
a
service
was
one
central
laboratory
of
sufficient
capacity
to
prepare
all
ammunition
and
thus
to
secure
the
vital
advantage
of
absolute
uniformity
authority
was
therefore
granted
to
concentrate
this
species
of
work
at
macon
georgia
plans
of
the
buildings
and
of
the
machinery
required
were
submitted
and
approved
and
the
work
was
begun
with
energy
the
pile
of
buildings
had
a
façade
of
six
hundred
feet
was
designed
with
taste
and
comprehended
every
possible
appliance
for
good
and
work
the
buildings
were
nearly
ready
for
occupation
at
the
close
of
the
war
and
some
of
the
machinery
had
arrived
at
bermuda
this
project
preceded
that
of
a
general
armory
for
the
confederacy
and
was
much
nearer
completion
these
with
the
admirable
at
augusta
would
have
been
completed
and
with
them
the
government
would
have
been
in
a
condition
to
supply
arms
and
ammunition
to
three
hundred
thousand
men
to
these
would
have
been
added
a
foundry
for
heavy
guns
at
selma
or
brierfield
alabama
where
the
strongest
cast
iron
in
the
country
had
been
made
thus
has
been
briefly
sketched
the
development
of
the
resources
from
which
our
large
armies
were
supplied
with
arms
and
ammunition
while
our
country
was
invaded
on
land
and
water
by
armies
much
larger
than
our
own
it
will
be
seen
under
what
disadvantages
our
people
successfully
prosecuted
the
to
them
new
pursuits
of
mining
and
manufacturing
the
chief
of
ordnance
was
general
gorgas
a
man
remarkable
for
his
scientific
attainment
for
the
highest
administrative
capacity
and
moral
purity
all
crowned
by
zeal
and
fidelity
to
his
trust
in
which
he
achieved
results
greatly
disproportioned
to
the
means
at
his
command
he
closes
his
excellent
monograph
in
the
following
words
we
began
in
april
without
an
arsenal
laboratory
or
of
any
capacity
and
with
no
foundry
or
except
in
richmond
and
before
the
close
of
or
within
a
little
over
two
years
we
supplied
them
during
the
harassments
of
war
while
holding
our
own
in
the
field
defiantly
and
successfully
against
a
powerful
enemy
crippled
by
a
depreciated
currency
throttled
with
a
blockade
that
deprived
us
of
nearly
all
the
means
of
getting
material
or
workmen
obliged
to
send
almost
every
man
to
the
field
unable
to
use
the
with
which
we
were
abundantly
supplied
except
in
the
most
unskilled
departments
of
production
hampered
by
want
of
transportation
even
of
the
commonest
supplies
of
food
with
no
stock
on
hand
even
of
articles
such
as
steel
copper
leather
iron
which
we
must
have
to
build
up
our
establishments
against
all
these
obstacles
in
spite
of
all
these
deficiencies
we
persevered
at
home
as
determinedly
as
did
our
troops
in
the
field
against
a
more
tangible
opposition
and
in
that
short
period
created
almost
literally
out
of
the
ground
foundries
and
at
selma
richmond
atlanta
and
macon
at
petersburg
chemical
works
at
charlotte
north
carolina
a
far
superior
to
any
in
the
united
states
and
unsurpassed
by
any
across
the
ocean
and
a
chain
of
arsenals
armories
and
laboratories
equal
in
their
capacity
and
their
improved
appointments
to
the
best
of
those
in
the
united
states
stretching
link
by
link
from
virginia
to
alabama
the
same
officer
writes
it
was
a
charge
often
repeated
at
the
north
against
general
floyd
that
as
secretary
of
war
he
had
with
traitorous
intent
abused
his
office
by
sending
arms
to
the
south
just
before
the
secession
of
the
states
the
transactions
which
gave
rise
to
this
accusation
were
in
the
ordinary
course
of
an
economical
administration
of
the
war
department
after
it
had
been
determined
to
change
the
old
muskets
which
the
united
states
possessed
to
percussion
it
was
deemed
cheaper
to
bring
all
the
arms
in
store
at
southern
arsenals
to
the
northern
arsenals
and
armories
for
alteration
rather
than
to
send
the
necessary
machinery
and
workmen
to
the
south
consequently
the
southern
arsenals
were
stripped
of
their
deposits
which
were
sent
to
springfield
watervliet
pittsburg
louis
and
other
points
after
the
conversion
had
been
effected
the
denuded
southern
arsenals
were
again
supplied
with
about
the
same
number
perhaps
slightly
augmented
that
had
formerly
been
stored
there
the
quota
deposited
at
the
charleston
arsenal
where
i
was
stationed
in
arrived
there
full
a
year
before
the
opening
of
the
war
the
charge
was
made
early
in
the
war
that
i
was
slow
in
procuring
arms
and
munitions
of
war
from
europe
we
were
not
only
in
advance
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
markets
of
europe
but
the
facts
presented
in
the
following
extracts
from
a
letter
of
our
agent
caleb
huse
dated
december
and
addressed
to
major
anderson
will
serve
to
place
the
matter
in
its

london
dear
major
we
are
all
waiting
with
almost
breathless
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
the

to
the
unqualified
demand
of
england
for

we
shall
soon
know
if
the

are
given
up
the
affair
will
result
in
great
inconvenience
to
us
in
the
way
of
shipping

i
have
now
more
than
enough
to
load
three
and
can
not
ship
a

though
i
have
a

off

we
are

are
stowed

not

or
deliver
by
land
or

any
goods
marked
without
first
acquainting
the
honorable
board
of

i
have
applied
myself
to
ship
to
bermuda
offering
to
give
bonds
to
double
the
amount
of
value
of
the
goods
that
they
should
be
held
in

subject
to
the
direction
of
her
majesty
representative
in

i
has
applied
for
permission
to
ship
to
cardenas
agreeing
to
hold
the
goods
subject
to
the
order
of
the
spanish
authorities
but
all
without
avail
and
our

must
suffer
for
the
want
of
blankets

field
forges
arms
and
ammunition
which
have
been
collected
to
an
amount
more
than
double

is
miserable
to
have
to
look

stated
in
my

address
in
i
said
the
first
year
of
our
history
has
been
the
most
eventful
in
the
annals
of
this
continent
a
new
government
has
been
established
and
its
machinery
put
in
operation
over
an
area
exceeding
seven
hundred
thousand
square
miles
the
great
principles
upon
which
we
have
been
willing
to
hazard
everything
that
is
dear
to
man
have
made
conquests
for
us
which
could
never
have
been
achieved
by
the
sword
our
confederacy
has
grown
from
six
to
thirteen
states
and
maryland
already
united
to
us
by
hallowed
memories
and
material
interests
will
i
believe
when
enabled
to
speak
with
unstifled
voice
connect
her
destiny
with
the
south
our
people
have
rallied
with
unexampled
unanimity
to
the
support
of
the
great
principles
of
constitutional
government
with
firm
resolve
to
perpetuate
by
arms
the
rights
which
they
could
not
peacefully
secure
a
million
of
men
it
is
estimated
are
now
standing
in
hostile
array
and
waging
war
along
a
frontier
of
thousands
of
miles
battles
have
been
fought
sieges
have
been
conducted
and
although
the
contest
is
not
ended
and
the
tide
for
the
moment
is
against
us
the
final
result
in
our
favor
is
not
doubtful
after
the
struggles
of
ages
had
consecrated
the
right
of
the
englishman
to
constitutional
representative
government
our
colonial
ancestors
were
forced
to
vindicate
that
birthright
by
an
appeal
to
arms
success
crowned
their
efforts
and
they
provided
for
their
posterity
a
peaceful
remedy
against
future
aggression
the
tyranny
of
an
unbridled
majority
the
most
odious
and
the
least
responsible
form
of
despotism
has
denied
us
both
the
right
and
the
remedy
therefore
we
are
in
arms
to
renew
such
sacrifices
as
our
forefathers
made
to
the
holy
cause
of
constitutional
liberty
the
financial
system
which
had
been
adopted
from
necessity
proved
adequate
at
this
early
period
to
supply
all
the
wants
of
the
government
and
of
the
people
an
unexpected
and
very
large
increase
of
expenditures
had
resulted
from
the
great
enlargement
of
the
necessary
means
of
defense
yet
the
government
entered
on
its
second
year
without
a
floating
debt
and
with
its

unimpaired
the
total

an
important
measure
was

the
object

which
was

after
the

the

was
prohibited
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
government
an
issue
of
five
hundred
million
dollars
in
six
per
cent
bonds
was
authorized
for
the
payment
of
interest
the
receipts
of
the
export
and
import
duties
payable
in
specie
were
pledged
a
review
of
this
statement
of
the
legislation
of
congress
will
clearly
present
the
financial
system
of
the
government
the
first
action
of
the
provisional
congress
was
confined
to
the
adoption
of
a
tariff
law
and
an
act
for
a
loan
of
fifteen
million
dollars
with
a
pledge
of
a
small
export
duty
on
cotton
to
provide
for
the
redemption
of
the
debt
at
the
next
session
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
provision
was
made
for
the
issue
of
twenty
million
dollars
in
treasury
notes
and
for
borrowing
thirty
million
dollars
in
bonds
at
the
same
time
the
tariff
was
revised
and
preparatory
measures
taken
for
the
levy
of
internal
taxes
after
the
purpose
of
subjugation
became
manifest
by
the
action
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
early
in
july
and
the
certainty
of
a
long
war
was
demonstrated
there
arose
the
necessity
that
a
financial
system
should
be
devised
on
a
basis
sufficiently
large
for
the
vast
proportions
of
the
approaching
contest
the
plan
then
adopted
was
founded
on
the
theory
of
issuing
treasury
notes
convertible
at
the
pleasure
of
the
holder
into
eight
per
cent
bonds
with
the
interest
payable
in
coin
it
was
assumed
that
any
tendency
to
depreciation
which
might
arise
from
the
of
the
currency
would
be
checked
by
the
constant
exercise
of
the
holder
right
to
fund
the
notes
at
a
liberal
interest
payable
in
specie
the
success
of
this
system
depended
on
the
ability
of
the
government
constantly
to
pay
the
interest
in
specie
the
measures
therefore
adopted
to
secure
that
payment
consisted
in
the
levy
of
an
internal
tax
termed
a
war
tax
and
the
appropriation
of
the
revenue
from
imports
the
first
operation
of
this
plan
was
quite
successful
the
interest
was
paid
from
the
reserve
of
coin
existing
in
the
country
and
experience
sustained
the
expectations
of
those
who
devised
the
system
wheat
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
was
selling
at
one
dollar
and
thirty
cents
per
bushel
thus
but
little
exceeding
its
average
price
in
time
of
peace
the
other
agricultural
products
of
the
country
were
at
similarly
moderate
rates
thus
indicating
that
there
was
no
excess
of
circulation
at
the
same
time
the
premium
on
coin
had
reached
about
twenty
per
cent
but
it
had
become
apparent
that
the
commerce
of
our
country
was
threatened
with
permanent
suspension
by
reason
of
the
conduct
of
neutral
nations
who
virtually
gave
aid
to
the
united
states
government
by
sanctioning
its
declaration
of
a
blockade
these
neutral
nations
treated
our
invasion
by
our
former
limited
and
special
agent
as
though
it
were
the
attempt
of
a
sovereign
to
suppress
a
rebellion
against
lawful
authority
this
exceptional
cause
heightened
the
premium
on
specie
because
it
indicated
the
exhaustion
of
our
reserve
without
the
possibility
of
renewing
the
supply
at
the
inauguration
of
the
permanent
government
in
february
a
popular
aversion
to
internal
taxation
had
been
so
strongly
manifested
as
to
indicate
its
partial
failure
this
will
be
further
explained
presently
in
our
statement
of
the
system
of
taxation
under
all
these
circumstances
the
effort
was
made
to
avoid
the
increase
in
the
volume
of
notes
in
circulation
by
offering
inducements
to
voluntary
funding
the
measures
adopted
for
that
purpose
were
but
partially
successful
meanwhile
the
intervening
exigencies
from
the
fortunes
of
war
permitted
no
delay
the
issues
of
treasury
notes
were
increased
until
in
december
the
currency
in
circulation
amounted
to
more
than
six
hundred
million
dollars
or
more
than
threefold
the
amount
required
by
the
business
of
the
country
the
evil
effects
of
this
financial
condition
were
but
too
apparent
in
addition
to
the
difficulty
presented
to
the
necessary
operations
of
the
government
and
the
efficient
conduct
of
the
war
the
most
deplorable
of
all
its
results
was
undoubtedly
its
corrupting
influence
on
the
morals
of
the
people
the
possession
of
large
amounts
of
treasury
notes
led
to
a
desire
for
investment
and
with
a
constantly
increasing
volume
of
currency
there
was
an
equally
constant
increase
of
price
in
all
objects
of
investment
this
effect
stimulated
purchase
by
the
apparent
certainty
of
profit
and
a
spirit
of
speculation
was
thus
fostered
which
had
so
debasing
an
influence
and
such
ruinous
consequences
that
it
became
our
highest
duty
to
remove
the
cause
by
prompt
and
stringent
measures
i
therefore
recommended
to
congress
in
december
the
compulsory
reduction
of
the
currency
to
the
amount
required
by
the
business
of
the
country
accompanied
by
a
pledge
that
under
no
stress
of
circumstances
would
the
amount
be
increased
i
stated
that
if
the
currency
was
not
greatly
and
promptly
reduced
the
existing
scale
of
inflated
prices
would
not
only
continue
but
by
the
very
fact
of
the
large
amounts
thus
made
requisite
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
these
prices
would
reach
rates
still
more
extravagant
and
the
whole
system
would
fall
under
its
own
weight
rendering
the
redemption
of
the
debt
impossible
and
destroying
its
value
in
the
hands
of
the
holder
if
on
the
contrary
a
funded
debt
with
interest
secured
by
adequate
taxation
could
be
substituted
for
the
outstanding
currency
its
entire
amount
would
be
made
available
to
the
holder
and
the
government
would
be
in
a
condition
beyond
the
reach
of
any
probable
contingency
to
prosecute
the
war
to
a
successful
issue
this
recommendation
was
followed
by
the
passage
of
the
act
of
february
above
mentioned
one
of
its
features
is
the
tax
levied
on
the
circulation
regarding
the
government
when
contracting
a
debt
as
the
agent
of
the
people
its
debt
is
their
debt
as
the
currency
was
held
exclusively
by
ourselves
it
was
obvious
that
if
each
person
held
treasury
notes
in
exact
proportion
to
the
valuation
of
his
whole
estate
each
would
in
fact
owe
himself
the
amount
of
the
notes
held
by
him
and
were
it
possible
to
distribute
the
currency
among
the
people
in
this
exact
proportion
a
tax
levied
on
the
currency
alone
to
an
amount
sufficient
to
reduce
it
to
its
proper
limits
would
afford
the
best
of
all
remedies
under
such
circumstances
the
notes
remaining
in
the
hands
of
each
holder
after
the
payment
of
his
tax
would
be
worth
quite
as
much
as
the
whole
sum
previously
held
for
it
would
have
an
equal
purchasing
capacity
after
this
law
had
been
in
operation
for
one
year
it
was
manifest
that
it
had
the
desired
effect
of
withdrawing
from
circulation
the
large
excess
of
treasury
notes
which
had
been
issued
on
july
the
outstanding
amount
was
estimated
at
two
hundred
and
thirty
million
dollars
the
estimate
of
the
amount
funded
under
this
act
about
this
time
was
three
hundred
million
dollars
while
new
notes
were
authorized
to
be
issued
to
the
extent
of
two
thirds
of
the
sum
received
under
its
provisions
the
chief
difficulty
apprehended
in
connection
with
our
finances
up
to
the
close
of
the
war
resulted
from
the
depreciation
of
our
treasury
notes
which
was
to
be
attributed
to
the
increasing
redundancy
in
amount
and
the
diminishing
confidence
in
their
ultimate
redemption
the
financial
condition
of
the
government
near
its
close
is
very
correctly
represented
in
the
report
of
the
treasury
department
the
total
receipts
of
the
treasury
for
the
two
quarters
ending
on
september
amounted
to
which
sum
added
to
the
balance
that
remained
in
the
treasury
on
april
formed
a
total
of
of
this
total
not
far
from
half
that
is
to
say
were
applied
to
the
extinction
of
the
public
debt
while
the
total
expenditures
were
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
october
of
the
sources
from
which
this
revenue
was
derived
were

on

in
consequence
however
of
the
absence
of
certain

from

the
true

was
less

than
appeared
on

that
the
total

a

of

by
which

at

or
as

with

arising
therefrom
were
continued
in
office
with
the
same
powers
and
subject
to
the
same
duties
the
tariff
laws
of
the
united
states
were
continued
in
force
until
they
might
be
altered
the
free
list
was
enlarged
so
as
to
embrace
many
articles
of
necessity
additional
ports
and
places
of
entry
were
established
restrictive
laws
were
repealed
and
foreign
vessels
were
admitted
to
the
a
lighthouse
bureau
was
organized
a
lower
rate
of
duties
was
imposed
on
a
number
of
enumerated
articles
and
an
export
duty
of
one
eighth
of
one
cent
per
pound
was
imposed
on
all
cotton
exported
in
the
raw
state
at
the
second
session
in
may
a
complete
tariff
law
was
enacted
with
a
lower
scale
of
duties
than
had
previously
existed
on
august
a
of
fifty
cents
on
each
hundred
dollars
of
certain
classes
of
property
was
levied
for
the
special
purpose
of
paying
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
public
debt
and
of
supporting
the
government
the
different
classes
of
property
on
which
the
tax
was
levied
were
as
follows
real

of
all
kinds
slaves
merchandise
railroad

other

stocks
money

or
invested
by

and
there
were
some

such
as

of
educational
charitable
and
religious
institutions
and
of
a

of
a
family
having
property
worth
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
an
act
was
passed
for
the
sequestration
of
the
property
of
alien
enemies
as
a
retaliatory
measure
to
offset
the
confiscation
act
of
the
united
states
on
april
a
new
act
was
passed
relative
to
internal
or
direct
taxes
it
was
designed
to
reach
as
far
as
practicable
every
resource
of
the
country
except
the
capital
invested
in
real
estate
and
slaves
and
by
means
of
an
and
a
tax
in
kind
on
the
produce
of
the
soil
as
well
as
by
licenses
on
business
occupations
and
professions
to
command
resources
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
the
country
on
february
an
amendment
to
this
act
was
passed
it
levied
additional
taxes
on
all
business
of
individuals
of
copartnerships
and
corporations
also
on
trades
sales
distillers
and
a
tax
in
kind
on
agriculturists
on
june
an
act
was
passed
which
levied
a
tax
equal
to
one
fifth
of
the
amount
of
the
existing
tax
upon
all
subjects
of
taxation
for
the
year
within
six
months
after
the
passage
of
the
of
august
the
popular
aversion
to
internal
taxation
by
the
general
government
had
so
influenced
the
legislation
of
the
several
states
that
only
in
south
carolina
mississippi
and
texas
were
the
taxes
actually
collected
from
the
people
the
quotas
of
the
remaining
states
had
been
raised
by
the
issue
of
bonds
and
state
treasury
notes
the
public
debt
of
the
country
was
thus
actually
increased
instead
of
being
diminished
by
the
taxation
imposed
by
congress
at
the
first
and
second
sessions
of
congress
in
no
means
were
provided
by
taxation
for
maintaining
the
government
the
legislation
was
confined
to
authorizing
further
sales
of
bonds
and
issues
of
treasury
notes
an
obstacle
had
arisen
against
successful
taxation
about
two
thirds
of
the
entire
taxable
property
of
the
confederate
states
consisted
in
land
and
slaves
under
the
provisional
constitution
which
ceased
to
be
in
force
on
february
the
power
of
congress
to
levy
taxes
was
not
restricted
by
any
other
condition
than
that
all
duties
imposts
and
excises
should
be
uniform
throughout
the
states
of
the
confederacy
but
in
the
permanent
constitution
which
took
effect
on
the
same
day
february
it
was
specially
provided
that
representatives
and
direct
taxes
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers
which
shall
be
determined
by
adding
to
the
whole
number
of
free
persons
including
those
bound
to
service
for
a
term
of
years
and
excluding
indians
not
taxed
three
fifths
of
all
slaves
according
to
the
received
construction
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
had
been
acquiesced
in
for
sixty
years
taxes
on
lands
and
slaves
were
direct
taxes
in
repeating
without
modification
in
our
constitution
this
language
of
the
united
states
constitution
our
convention
necessarily
seems
to
have
intended
to
attach
to
it
the
meaning
which
had
been
sanctioned
by
long
and
uninterrupted
acquiescence
thus
deciding
that
taxes
on
lands
and
slaves
were
direct
taxes
our
constitution
further
ordered
that
a
census
should
be
made
within
three
years
after
the
first
meeting
of
congress
and
that
no
capitation
or
other
direct
tax
shall
be
laid
unless
in
proportion
to
the
census
or
enumeration
hereinbefore
directed
to
be
taken
so
long
as
there
seemed
to
be
a
probability
of
being
able
to
carry
out
these
provisions
of
the
constitution
fully
and
in
conformity
with
the
intentions
of
its
authors
there
was
an
obvious
difficulty
in
framing
any
system
of
taxation
a
law
which
should
exempt
from
the
burden
two
thirds
of
the
property
of
the
country
would
be
as
unfair
to
the
owners
of
the
remaining
third
as
it
would
be
inadequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
public
service
the
urgency
of
the
need
however
was
such
that
after
great
embarrassment
the
law
of
april
above
mentioned
was
framed
still
a
very
large
proportion
of
these
resources
was
unavailable
for
some
time
and
the
intervening
exigencies
permitting
of
no
delay
a
resort
to
further
issues
of
treasury
notes
became
unavoidable
the
foreign
debt
of
the
confederate
states
at
the
close
of
the
war
was
hundred
thousand
pounds
the
earliest
proposals
on
which
this
debt
was
contracted
were
issued
in
london
and
paris
in
march
the
bonds
bore
interest
at
seven
per
cent
per
annum
in
sterling
payable
they
were
exchangeable
for
cotton
on
application
at
the
option
of
the
holder
or
redeemable
at
par
in
sterling
in
twenty
years
by
drawings
commencing
march
the
special
security
of
these
bonds
was
the
engagement
of
the
government
to
deliver
cotton
to
the
holders
each
bond
the
option
of
the
was
convertible
at
its
nominal
amount
into
cotton
at
the
rate
of
sixpence
sterling
for
each
pound
of
cotton
say
four
thousand
pounds
of
cotton
for
each
bond
of
a
hundred
pounds
or
hundred
francs
and
this
could
be
done
at
any
time
not
later
than
six
months
after
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
belligerents
sixty
days
after
the
notice
the
cotton
was
to
be
delivered
if
in
a
state
of
peace
at
the
ports
of
charleston
savannah
mobile
or
new
orleans
if
at
war
at
points
in
the
interior
of
the
country
within
ten
miles
of
a
railroad
or
a
stream
navigable
to
the
ocean
the
delivery
was
to
be
made
free
of
all
charges
except
the
export
duty
of
one
eighth
of
one
cent
per
pound
the
quality
of
the
cotton
was
to
be
the
standard
of
new
orleans
middling
an
annual
sinking
fund
of
five
per
cent
was
provided
for
whereby
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
the
bonds
unredeemed
by
cotton
should
be
drawn
by
lot
so
as
finally
to
extinguish
the
loan
in
twenty
years
from
the
first
drawing
the
bonds
were
issued
at
ninety
per
payable
in
installments
the
loan
soon
stood
in
the
london
market
at
five
per
cent
premium
the
amount
asked
for
was
three
million
pounds
the
amount
of
applications
in
london
and
paris
exceeded
fifteen
million
pounds
great
efforts
had
previously
been
made
by
agents
of
the
united
states
government
to
reflect
upon
the
credit
of
the
confederate
states
by
resuscitating
an
almost
forgotten
accusation
of
repudiation
against
the
state
of
mississippi
and
especially
by
an
emissary
sent
to
great
britain
than
whom
no
one
knew
better
how
false
were
the
attempts
to
implicate
my
name
in
that
charge
the
slanderous
tongues
of
northern
hatred
even
went
so
far
as
to
style
me
the
father
of
repudiation
how
unjust
all
such
assertions
were
will
be
manifest
by
a
simple
statement
of
the
case
we
should
not
omit
to
refer
once
more
to
the
most
prolific
source
of
sectional
strife
and
alienation
which
is
believed
to
have
been
the
question
of
the
tariff
or
duties
upon
imports
its
influence
extended
to
and
affected
subjects
with
which
it
was
not
visibly
connected
and
finally
assumed
a
form
surely
not
contemplated
in
the
original
formation
of
the
union
in
the
articles
of
confederation
the
first
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
theory
was
that
of
direct
taxation
and
the
manner
was
to
impose
upon
the
states
an
amount
which
each
was
to
furnish
to
the
common
treasury
to
defray
expenses
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
during
the
period
of
our
colonial
existence
the
policy
of
the
british
government
had
been
to
suppress
the
growth
of
manufacturing
industry
it
was
forcibly
expressed
by
lord
north
in
the
declaration
that
not
a
hobnail
should
be
made
in
the
american
colonies
the
consequence
was
that
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
our
armies
and
people
suffered
so
much
from
the
want
of
the
most
necessary
supplies
that
general
washington
after
we
had
achieved
our
independence
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
government
should
by
bounties
encourage
the
manufacture
of
such
materials
as
were
necessary
in
time
of
war
in
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
for
a
more
perfect
union
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
agreeing
upon
its
terms
was
found
in
the
different
interests
of
the
states
but
among
the
compromises
which
were
made
there
prominently
appears
the
purpose
of
a
strict
equality
in
the
burdens
to
be
borne
as
well
as
the
blessings
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
for
a
long
time
after
the
formation
of
the
more
perfect
union
but
little
capital
was
invested
in
manufacturing
establishments
and
though
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
the
amount
had
considerably
increased
the
products
were
yet
quite
insufficient
for
the
necessary
supplies
of
our
armies
in
the
war
of
government
contracts
high
prices
and
to
some
extent
no
doubt
patriotic
impulses
led
to
the
investment
of
capital
in
the
articles
required
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
with
the
restoration
of
peace
and
the
renewal
of
commerce
prices
naturally
declined
and
it
was
represented
that
the
investments
made
in
manufacturing
establishments
were
so
unprofitable
as
to
involve
the
ruin
of
those
who
had
made
them
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
from
motives
at
least
to
be
commended
for
their
generosity
enacted
a
law
to
protect
from
the
threatened
ruin
those
of
their
countrymen
who
had
employed
their
capital
for
purposes
demanded
by
the
general
welfare
and
common
defense
these
good
intentions
if
it
be
conceded
that
the
danger
was
real
which
it
was
designed
to
avert
were
most
unfortunate
as
the
beginning
of
a
policy
the
end
of
which
was
fraught
with
the
greatest
evils
that
have
ever
befallen
the
union
by
the
constitution
of
power
was
conferred
upon
congress
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
but
all
duties
imposts
and
excises
shall
be
uniform
throughout
the
united
states
in
the
exercise
of
this
delegated
trust
tariff
laws
were
enacted
and
had
been
in
operation
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parts
of
the
union
from
the
organization
of
the
government
down
to
but
throughout
that
period
all
of
those
laws
were
based
upon
the
principle
of
duties
for
revenue
it
was
true
and
of
course
it
was
known
that
such
duties
would
give
incidental
protection
to
any
industry
producing
an
article
on
which
the
duty
was
levied
but
while
the
money
was
collected
for
the
purposes
enumerated
and
the
rate
kept
down
to
the
lowest
revenue
standard
the
consumer
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
indirect
benefit
received
by
the
manufacturer
and
the
history
of
the
time
shows
that
it
produced
no
discontent
not
so
with
the
tariff
law
of
though
sustained
by
men
from
all
sections
of
the
union
and
notably
by
so
strict
a
constructionist
as
calhoun
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
saw
in
it
a
departure
from
the
limitation
of
the
constitution
and
sternly
opposed
it
as
the
usurpation
of
a
power
to
legislate
for
the
benefit
of
a
class
the
law
derived
much
of
its
support
from
the
assurance
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
measure
and
intended
to
shield
those
whose
patriotism
had
exposed
them
to
danger
thus
presenting
the
not
uncommon
occurrence
of
a
good
case
making
a
bad
precedent
for
the
first
time
a
tariff
law
had
protection
for
its
object
and
for
the
first
time
it
produced
discontent
in
the
law
there
was
nothing
which
necessarily
gave
to
it
or
in
its
terms
violated
the
obligation
that
duties
should
be
uniform
throughout
the
united
states
the
fact
that
it
affected
the
sections
differently
was
due
to
physical
causes
that
is
geographical
differences
the
streams
of
the
southern
atlantic
states
ran
over
wide
plains
into
the
sea
their
last
falls
were
remote
from
ocean
navigation
and
their
people
almost
exclusively
agricultural
resided
principally
on
this
plain
and
as
near
to
the
seaboard
as
circumstances
would
permit
in
the
northern
atlantic
states
the
highlands
approached
more
nearly
to
the
sea
and
the
rivers
made
their
last
leap
near
to
harbors
of
commerce
being
relied
on
before
the
had
been
made
and
ships
the
medium
of
commerce
before
railroads
and
locomotives
were
introduced
it
followed
that
the
staples
of
the
southern
plains
were
economically
sent
to
the
of
the
north
to
be
manufactured
this
remark
of
course
applies
to
such
articles
as
were
not
exported
to
foreign
countries
and
is
intended
to
explain
how
the
north
became
the
seat
of
manufactures
and
the
south
remained
agricultural
from
this
it
followed
that
legislation
for
the
benefit
of
manufacturers
became
a
northern
policy
it
was
not
as
has
been
erroneously
stated
because
of
the
agricultural
character
of
the
southern
people
that
they
were
opposed
to
the
policy
inaugurated
by
the
tariff
act
of
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
anterior
to
that
time
they
had
been
the
friends
of
manufacturing
industry
without
reference
to
its
location
as
long
as
duties
were
imposed
for
revenue
so
that
the
object
was
to
supply
the
common
treasury
it
had
been
cheerfully
borne
and
the
agriculture
of
one
section
and
the
manufacturing
of
another
were
properly
regarded
as
handmaids
and
not
unfrequently
referred
to
as
the
means
of
strengthening
and
perpetuating
the
bonds
by
which
the
states
were
united
when
duties
were
imposed
not
for
revenue
but
as
a
bounty
to
a
particular
industry
it
was
regarded
both
as
unjust
and
without
warrant
expressed
or
implied
in
the
constitution
then
arose
the
controversy
quadrennially
renewed
and
with
increasing
provocation
in
in
and
in
each
stage
intensifying
the
discontent
arising
more
from
the
injustice
than
the
weight
of
the
burden
borne
it
was
not
the
tax
but
the
violation
of
magna
charta
which
hampden
and
his
associates
resisted
it
was
not
the
stamp
duty
nor
the
but
the
principle
involved
in
taxation
without
representation
against
which
our
colonial
fathers
took
up
arms
so
the
tariff
act
in
known
at
the
time
as
the
bill
of
abominations
was
resisted
by
southern
representatives
because
it
was
the
invasion
of
private
rights
in
violation
of
the
compact
by
which
the
states
were
united
in
the
last
stage
of
the
proceeding
after
the
friends
of
the
bill
had
advocated
it
as
a
measure
for
protecting
capital
invested
in
manufactures
drayton
of
south
carolina
moved
to
amend
the
title
so
that
it
should
read
an
act
to
increase
the
duties
upon
certain
imports
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
profits
of
certain
manufacturers
and
stated
his
purpose
for
desiring
to
amend
the
title
to
be
that
upon
some
case
which
would
arise
under
the
execution
of
the
law
an
appeal
might
be
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
test
its
constitutionality
those
who
had
passed
the
bill
refused
to
allow
the
opportunity
to
test
the
validity
of
a
tax
imposed
for
the
protection
of
a
particular
industry
though
the
debates
showed
clearly
enough
the
purpose
to
be
to
impose
duties
for
protection
the
phraseology
of
the
law
presented
it
as
enacted
to
raise
revenue
and
therefore
the
victims
of
the
discrimination
were
deprived
of
an
appeal
to
the
tribunal
instituted
to
hear
and
decide
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
south
carolina
oppressed
by
onerous
duties
and
stung
by
the
injustice
of
a
refusal
to
allow
her
the
ordinary
remedy
against
unconstitutional
legislation
asserted
the
right
as
a
sovereign
state
to
nullify
the
law
this
conflict
between
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
one
of
the
states
threatened
for
a
time
such
disastrous
consequences
as
to
excite
intense
feeling
in
all
who
loved
the
union
as
the
fraternal
federation
of
equal
states
before
an
actual
collision
of
arms
occurred
congress
wisely
adopted
the
compromise
act
of
by
that
the
fact
of
protection
remained
but
the
principle
of
duties
for
revenue
was
recognized
by
a
sliding
scale
of
reduction
and
it
was
hoped
the
question
had
been
placed
upon
a
basis
that
promised
a
permanent
peace
the
party
of
protective
duties
however
came
into
power
about
the
close
of
the
period
when
the
compromise
measure
had
reached
the
result
it
proposed
and
the
contest
was
renewed
with
little
faith
on
the
part
of
the
then
dominant
party
and
with
more
than
all
of
its
former
bitterness
the
cause
of
the
departure
from
a
sound
principle
of
a
tariff
for
revenue
which
had
prevailed
during
the
first
quarter
of
a
century
and
the
adoption
in
of
the
rule
imposing
duties
for
protection
was
stated
by
mcduffie
to
be
that
politicians
and
capitalists
had
seized
upon
the
subject
and
used
it
for
their
own
purposes
the
former
for
political
advancement
the
latter
for
their
own
pecuniary
profit
and
that
the
question
had
become
one
of
partisan
politics
and
sectional
enrichment
contemporaneously
with
this
theory
of
protective
duties
arose
the
policy
of
making
appropriations
from
the
common
treasury
for
local
improvements
as
the
southern
representatives
were
mainly
those
who
denied
the
constitutional
power
to
make
such
expenditures
it
naturally
resulted
that
the
mass
of
those
appropriations
were
made
for
northern
works
now
that
direct
taxes
had
in
practice
been
so
wholly
abandoned
as
to
be
almost
an
obsolete
idea
and
now
that
the
treasury
was
supplied
by
the
collection
of
duties
upon
imports
two
golden
streams
flowed
steadily
to
enrich
the
northern
and
manufacturing
region
by
the
impoverishment
of
the
southern
and
agricultural
section
in
the
train
of
wealth
and
demand
for
labor
followed
immigration
and
the
more
rapid
increase
of
population
in
the
northern
than
in
the
southern
states
i
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
other
causes
such
as
the
fertile
region
of
the
northwest
the
better
harbors
the
greater
amount
of
shipping
of
the
northeastern
states
and
the
prejudice
of
europeans
against
contact
with
the
negro
race
but
the
causes
i
have
first
stated
were
i
think
the
chief
and
those
only
which
are
referable
to
the
action
of
the
general
government
it
was
not
found
that
the
possession
of
power
mitigated
the
injustice
of
its
use
by
the
north
and
discontent
therefore
was
steadily
accumulating
and
as
stated
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
i
think
was
due
to
class
legislation
in
the
form
of
protective
duties
and
its
consequences
more
than
to
any
or
all
other
causes
combined
turning
from
the
consideration
of
this
question
in
its
sectional
aspect
i
now
invite
attention
to
its
general
effect
upon
the
character
of
our
institutions
if
the
common
treasury
of
the
states
had
as
under
the
confederation
been
supplied
by
direct
taxation
who
can
doubt
that
a
rigid
economy
would
have
been
the
rule
of
the
government
that
representatives
would
have
returned
to
their
constituents
to
justify
appropriations
for
which
they
had
voted
by
showing
that
they
were
required
for
the
general
welfare
and
were
authorized
by
the
constitution
under
which
they
were
acting
when
the
money
was
obtained
by
indirect
taxation
so
that
but
few
could
see
the
source
from
which
it
was
derived
it
readily
followed
that
a
constituency
would
ask
not
why
the
representative
had
voted
for
the
expenditure
of
money
but
how
much
he
had
got
for
his
own
district
and
perhaps
he
might
have
to
explain
why
he
did
not
get
more
is
it
doubtful
that
this
would
lead
to
extravagance
if
not
to
corruption
nothing
could
be
more
fatal
to
the
independence
of
the
people
and
the
liberties
of
the
states
than
dependence
for
support
upon
the
public
treasury
whether
it
be
in
the
form
of
subsidies
of
bounties
or
restrictions
on
trade
for
the
benefit
of
special
interests
in
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
the
epoch
in
which
the
hopelessness
of
renovation
was
made
manifest
was
that
in
which
the
people
accepted
corn
from
the
public
granaries
it
preceded
but
a
little
the
time
when
the
post
of
emperor
became
a
matter
of
purchase
how
far
would
it
differ
from
this
if
constituencies
should
choose
their
representatives
not
for
their
integrity
not
for
their
capacity
not
for
their
past
services
but
because
of
their
ability
to
get
money
from
the
public
treasury
for
the
benefit
of
their
local
interests
and
how
far
would
it
differ
from
a
purchase
of
the
office
if
a
president
were
chosen
because
of
the
favor
he
would
show
to
certain
moneyed
interests
now
that
fanaticism
can
no
longer
inflame
the
prejudices
of
the
uninformed
it
may
be
hoped
that
our
statesmen
will
review
the
past
and
give
to
our
country
a
future
in
accordance
with
its
early
history
and
promotive
of
true
liberty

footnote
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
mississippi
union
bank
bonds
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows
the
constitution
of
mississippi
required
that
no
law
should
ever
be
passed
to
raise
a
loan
of
money
on
the
credit
of
the
state
or
to
pledge
the
faith
of
the
state
for
the
payment
or
redemption
of
any
loan
or
debt
unless
such
law
should
be
proposed
and
adopted
by
the
legislature
then
published
for
three
months
previous
to
the
next
regular
election
and
finally
reënacted
by
the
succeeding
legislature
the
object
was
to
enable
the
people
of
the
state
to
consider
the
question
intelligently
and
to
indicate
and
exercise
their
will
upon
it
by
the
election
of
representatives
to
the
ensuing
legislature
whose
views
upon
the
subject
would
be
known
and
with
such
instructions
express
or
implied
as
they
might
think
proper
to
give
in
a
law
was
passed
by
the
legislature
for
incorporating
the
union
bank
of
mississippi
with
a
capital
of
fifteen
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
be
raised
by
means
of
a
loan
to
be
obtained
by
the
directors
of
the
institution
in
order
to
secure
this
loan
the
stockholders
were
required
to
give
mortgages
on
productive
and
unencumbered
property
to
be
in
all
cases
of
value
greater
by
a
fixed
ratio
than
the
amount
of
their
stock
when
the
stock
had
been
thus
secured
as
a
further
guarantee
for
the
redemption
of
the
loan
the
governor
was
directed
to
issue
bonds
in
the
name
and
behalf
of
the
state
equal
in
amount
to
the
stock
secured
by
mortgage
on
private
property
no
bonds
as
thus
directed
were
ever
issued
this
act
was
duly
promulgated
to
the
people
and
duly
reënacted
by
the
succeeding
legislature
on
the
of
february
in
strict
accordance
with
the
constitution
ten
days
afterward
however
on
the
of
february
the
legislature
passed
an
act
to
the
act
chartering
the
union
bank
which
materially
changed
or
abolished
the
essential
conditions
for
the
pledge
of
the
credit
of
the
state
by
this
supplemental
act
the
governor
was
instructed
as
soon
as
the
books
of
subscription
should
be
opened
to
in
behalf
of
the
state
fifty
thousand
of
the
stock
of
the
original
capital
of
said
to
be
paid
for
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
state
bonds
to
be
executed
to
the
said
bank
as
already
provided
for
in
the
said
charter
this
act
was
passed
in
the
ordinary
mode
of
legislation
and
was
not
referred
published
nor
reënacted
as
prescribed
by
the
constitution
as
soon
as
the
directory
was
organized
and
the
books
of
subscription
were
opened
and
before
the
mortgages
required
by
the
charter
were
executed
the
governor
in
behalf
of
the
state
subscribed
for
fifty
thousand
shares
of
the
stock
and
issued
the
bonds
of
the
state
for
five
million
dollars
payable
to
the
order
of
the
bank
these
bonds
were
sold
to
nicholas
biddle
president
of
the
united
states
bank
of
pennsylvania
and
by
him
sent
to
great
britain
as
collateral
security
for
a
loan
previously
made
none
of
the
money
received
for
them
went
into
the
treasury
of
the
state
of
mississippi
nor
was
any
of
it
used
for
a
public
improvement
all
the
consideration
ever
received
by
the
state
was
its
stock
in
the
union
bank
the
bank
soon
failed
and
the
stock
became
utterly
worthless
before
the
bonds
became
due
the
governor
of
the
state
had
declared
them
to
be
null
and
void
among
other
causes
in
consequence
of
the
failure
to
sell
them
at
par
as
required
by
the
supplemental
act
under
which
they
were
issued
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
validity
or
nullity
of
the
bonds
the
object
is
merely
to
state
the
principal
facts
while
these
events
were
occurring
and
until
a
period
several
years
subsequent
to
their
consummation
i
who
had
just
resigned
my
commission
in
the
army
was
a
private
citizen
had
never
held
any
civil
office
and
took
no
part
in
political
affairs
indeed
i
have
never
at
any
time
before
during
or
since
those
events
held
any
civil
office
under
the
state
government
and
neither
had
nor
could
have
had
any
part
in
shaping
the
policy
of
the
state
when
brought
out
as
a
candidate
for
office
my
nomination
was
opposed
by
that
section
of
my
party
which
advocated
repudiation
on
account
of
my
opinions
in
favor
of
the
payment
of
the
bonds
as
a
private
citizen
it
may
be
stated
that
i
held
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
bonds
should
be
decided
by
the
courts
the
constitution
of
mississippi
authorized
suit
to
be
brought
against
the
state
in
such
cases
in
her
own
courts
and
this
i
regarded
as
the
proper
course
to
be
pursued
by
the
bondholders
holding
that
the
state
would
be
bound
by
the
judicial
decision
if
it
should
sustain
the
validity
of
the
claim
this
course
however
was
not
adopted
until
long
afterward
when
the
question
had
become
complicated
with
political
issues
which
rendered
the
effort
to
obtain
a
settlement
entirely
nugatory
when
i
was
a
member
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
my
official
influence
was
exerted
to
promote
the
objects
of
a
citizen
of
mississippi
who
with
from
the
united
states
secretary
of
state
buchanan
went
to
london
to
propose
to
the
bondholders
an
arrangement
by
which
the
claim
or
the
greater
portion
of
it
might
be
paid
by
private
subscription
on
consideration
of
the
cancellation
of
the
bonds
this
effort
failed
from
a
mistaken
estimate
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
principal
bondholders
to
whom
the
proposition
was
made
of
the
extent
to
which
state
pride
would
induce
our
citizens
to
contribute
and
to
the
belief
in
a
power
to
coerce
payment
the
gentleman
who
bore
the
proposal
indignant
at
the
offensive
manner
of
its
rejection
and
conscious
of
the
disinterestedness
of
his
motives
abandoned
the
negotiation
in
disgust
and
the
opportunity
was
lost

serve
as
an

of
the
achievements
in

during

of
the

the
authority
granted
to
the
president
to
call
for

in

for
a
short
period
was
sufficient
to
secure
all
the
military

could

it
became

this
was

toward

condition
the

being
lengthened
the

diminished

that

the

under

nevertheless
the
law
upon
which
our
success
so
greatly
depended
was
assailed
with
unexpected
criticism
in
various
quarters
a
constitutional
question
of
high
importance
was
raised
which
tended
to
involve
the
harmony
of
coöperation
so
essential
in
this
crisis
between

was

by

yourself
and
for
other
eminent
citizens
who
entertain
opinions
similar
to
yours
to
set
forth
somewhat
at
length
my
own
views
on
the
power
of
the
confederate
government
over
its
own
armies
and
the
militia
and
will
endeavor
not
to
leave
without
answer
any
of
the
positions
maintained
in
your
letters
the
main
if
not
the
only
purpose
for
which
independent
states
form
unions
or
confederations
is
to
combine
the
power
of
the
several
members
in
such
manner
as
to
form
one
united
force
in
all
relations
with
foreign
powers
whether
in
peace
or
in
war
each
state
amply
competent
to
administer
and
control
its
own
domestic
government
yet
too
feeble
successfully
to
resist
powerful
nations
seeks
safety
by
uniting
with
other
states
in
like
condition
and
by
delegating
to
some
common
agent
the
use
of
the
combined
strength
of
all
in
order
to
secure
advantageous
commercial
relations
in
peace
and
to
carry
on
hostilities
with
effect
in
war
now
the
powers
delegated
by
the
several
states
to
the
confederate
government
which
is
their
common
agent
are
enumerated
in
the
eighth
section
of
the
constitution
each
power
being
distinct
specific
and
enumerated
in
paragraphs
separately
numbered
the
only
exception
is
the
eighteenth
paragraph
which
by
its
own
terms
is
made
dependent
on
those
previously
enumerated
as
follows
to
make
all
laws
which
shall
be
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
the
foregoing
powers
etc
now
the
granted
to
the
congress
are
conferred
in
the
following
paragraphs
no
authority
to
raise
revenue
necessary
to
pay
the
debts
provide
for
common
and
carry
on
the
government
etc
no
declare
war
grant
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
and
make
rules
concerning
captures
on
land
and
water
no
raise
and
support
armies
but
no
appropriations
of
money
to
that
use
shall
be
for
a
longer
term
than
two
years
no
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
no
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
land
and
naval
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
broad
ample
and
unqualified
delegation
of
the
whole
war
power
of
each
state
than
is
here
contained
with
the
solitary
limitation
of
the
appropriations
to
two
years
the
states
not
only
gave
power
to
raise
money
for
the
common
defense
to
declare
war
to
raise
and
support
armies
in
the
plural
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
to
govern
and
regulate
both
land
and
naval
forces
but
they
went
further
and
covenanted
by
the
third
paragraph
of
the
tenth
section
not
engage
in
war
unless
actually
invaded
or
in
such
imminent
danger
as
will
not
admit
of
delay
i
know
of
but
two
modes
of
raising
armies
within
the
confederate
states
voluntary
enlistment
and
draft
or
conscription
i
perceive
in
the
delegation
of
power
to
raise
armies
no
restriction
as
to
the
mode
of
procuring
troops
i
see
nothing
which
confines
congress
to
one
class
of
men
nor
any
greater
power
to
receive
volunteers
than
conscripts
into
its
service
i
see
no
limitation
by
which
enlistments
are
to
be
received
of
individuals
only
but
not
of
companies
or
battalions
or
squadrons
or
regiments
i
find
no
limitation
of
time
of
service
but
only
of
duration
of
appropriation
i
discover
nothing
to
confine
congress
to
waging
war
within
the
limits
of
the
confederacy
nor
to
prohibit
offensive
war
in
a
word
when
congress
desires
to
raise
an
army
and
passes
a
law
for
that
purpose
the
solitary
question
is
under
the
eighteenth
paragraph
the
law
one
that
is
necessary
and
proper
to
execute
the
power
to
raise
armies
on
this
point
you
say
did
the
necessity
exist
in
this
case
the
conscription
act
can
not
aid
the
government
in
increasing
its
supply
of
or
but
can
only
enable
it
to
call
a
larger
number
of
men
into
the
field
the
difficulty
has
never
been
to
get
the
states
have
already
furnished
the
government
more
than
it
can
arm
etc
i
would
have
very
little
difficulty
in
establishing
to
your
entire
satisfaction
that
the
passage
of
the
law
was
not
only
necessary
but
that
it
was
absolutely
indispensable
that
numerous
regiments
of
twelve
months
men
were
on
the
eve
of
being
disbanded
whose
places
could
not
be
supplied
by
raw
levies
in
the
face
of
superior
numbers
of
the
foe
without
entailing
the
most
disastrous
results
that
the
position
of
our
armies
was
so
critical
as
to
fill
the
bosom
of
every
patriot
with
the
liveliest
apprehension
and
that
the
provisions
of
this
law
were
effective
in
warding
off
a
pressing
danger
but
i
prefer
to
answer
your
objection
on
other
and
broader
grounds
i
hold
that
when
a
specific
power
is
granted
by
the
constitution
like
that
now
in
question
raise
armies
congress
is
the
judge
whether
the
law
passed
for
the
purpose
of
executing
that
power
is
and
proper
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
armies
might
be
raised
in
other
ways
and
that
therefore
this
particular
way
is
not
the
same
argument
might
be
used
against
mode
of
raising
armies
to
each
successive
mode
suggested
the
objection
would
be
that
other
modes
were
practicable
and
that
therefore
the
particular
mode
used
was
not
the
true
and
only
test
is
to
inquire
whether
the
law
is
intended
and
calculated
to
carry
out
the
object
whether
it
devises
and
creates
an
instrumentality
for
executing
the
specific
power
granted
and
if
the
answer
be
in
the
affirmative
the
law
is
constitutional
none
can
doubt
that
the
conscription
law
is
calculated
and
intended
to
armies
it
is
therefore
and
proper
for
the
execution
of
that
power
and
is
constitutional
unless
it
comes
in
conflict
with
some
other
provision
of
our
confederate
compact
you
express
the
opinion
that
this
conflict
exists
and
support
your
argument
by
the
citation
of
those
clauses
which
refer
to
the
militia
there
are
certain
provisions
not
cited
by
you
which
are
not
without
influence
on
my
judgment
and
to
which
i
call
your
attention
they
will
aid
in
defining
what
is
meant
by
and
in
determining
the
respective
powers
of
the
states
and
the
confederacy
over
them
the
several
states
agree
to
keep
troops
or
ships
of
war
in
time
of
peace
they
further
stipulate
that
militia
being
necessary
for
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
no
person
shall
be
held
to
answer
for
a
capital
or
otherwise
infamous
crime
unless
on
a
presentment
or
indictment
of
a
grand
jury
except
in
cases
arising
in
the
or
or
in
when
in
actual
service
in
times
of
war
or
public
danger
what
then
are
militia
they
can
only
be
created
by
law
the
inhabitants
of
a
state
are
liable
to
become
its
militia
if
the
law
so
order
but
in
the
absence
of
a
law
to
that
effect
the
men
of
a
state
capable
of
bearing
arms
are
no
more
militia
than
they
are
seamen
the
constitution
also
tells
us
that
militia
are
not
nor
are
they
any
part
of
the
or
for
militia
exist
in
time
of
peace
and
the
constitution
forbids
the
states
to
keep
troops
in
time
of
peace
and
they
are
expressly
distinguished
and
placed
in
a
separate
category
from
land
or
naval
forces
in
the
sixteenth
paragraph
above
quoted
and
the
words
and
are
shown
by
paragraphs
and
to
mean
the
army
and
navy
of
the
confederate
states
now
if
militia
are
not
the
citizens
taken
singly
but
a
body
created
by
law
if
they
are
not
troops
if
they
are
no
part
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
confederacy
we
are
led
directly
to
the
definition
quoted
by
the
that
militia
are
body
of
soldiers
in
a
state
enrolled
for
discipline
in
other
words
the
term
is
a
collective
term
meaning
a
body
of
men
organized
and
can
not
be
applied
to
the
separate
individuals
who
compose
the
organization
the
constitution
divides
the
whole
military
strength
of
the
states
into
only
two
classes
of
organized
bodies
one
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
the
other
the
militia
of
the
states
in
the
delegation
of
power
to
the
confederacy
after
exhausting
the
subject
of
declaring
war
raising
and
supporting
armies
and
providing
a
navy
in
relation
to
all
which
the
grant
of
authority
to
congress
is
the
constitution
proceeds
to
deal
with
the
other
organized
body
the
militia
and
instead
of
delegating
power
to
congress
alone
or
reserving
it
to
the
states
alone
the
power
is
divided
as
follows
viz
congress
is
to
have
power
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
states
suppress
insurrections
and
provide
for
organizing
arming
and
disciplining
the
militia
and
for
governing
such
part
of
them
as
may
be
employed
in
the
service
of
the
confederate
states
to
states
respectively
the
appointment
of
the
and
the
of
training
the
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress
congress
then
has
the
power
to
provide
for
the
people
of
the
state
into
militia
each
has
the
power
to
officer
and
them
when
organized
may
call
forth
the
militia
to
execute
confederate
laws
the
has
not
surrendered
the
power
to
call
them
forth
to
execute
state
laws
congress
may
call
them
forth
to
repel
invasion
so
may
the
state
for
the
power
is
impliedly
reserved
of
governing
all
the
militia
except
the
part
in
actual
service
of
the
confederacy
i
confess
myself
at
a
loss
to
perceive
in
what
manner
these
careful
and
provisions
of
the
constitution
regulating
the
organization
and
government
of
the
militia
can
be
understood
as
applying
in
the
remotest
degree
to
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
nor
can
i
conceive
how
the
grant
of
power
to
declare
and
carry
on
war
by
armies
raised
and
supported
by
the
confederacy
is
to
be
restricted
or
diminished
by
the
clauses
which
grant
a
power
over
the
militia
on
the
contrary
the
delegation
of
authority
over
the
militia
so
far
as
granted
appears
to
me
to
be
plainly
an
enumerated
power
intended
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
confederate
government
in
the
discharge
of
its
paramount
duty
the
common
defense
of
the
states
you
state
after
quoting
the
twelfth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
grants
of
power
to
congress
that
grants
of
power
all
relate
to
the
same
and
are
all
contained
in
the
same
section
of
the
constitution
and
by
a
rule
of
construction
must
be
taken
as
a
whole
and
construed
together
this
argument
appears
to
me
unsound
the
powers
of
congress
are
enumerated
in
one
section
and
the
three
paragraphs
quoted
can
no
more
control
each
other
by
reason
of
their
location
in
the
same
section
than
they
can
control
any
of
the
other
paragraphs
preceding
intervening
or
succeeding
so
far
as
the
is
concerned
i
have
already
endeavored
to
show
that
the
armies
mentioned
in
the
twelfth
paragraph
are
a
as
distinct
from
the
militia
mentioned
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
as
they
are
from
the
navy
mentioned
in
the
thirteenth
nothing
can
so
mislead
as
to
construe
together
and
as
a
whole
the
carefully
separated
clauses
which
define
the
different
powers
to
be
exercised
over
distinct
subjects
by
the
congress
but
you
add
that
the
grant
of
power
to
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies
without
qualification
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
the
regular
armies
of
the
confederacy
and
not
armies
composed
of
the
whole
militia
of
all
the
states
i
must
confess
myself
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
position
if
i
am
right
that
the
militia
is
a
body
of
enrolled
state
soldiers
it
is
not
possible
in
the
nature
of
things
that
armies
raised
by
the
confederacy
can
composed
of
the
whole
militia
of
all
the
states
the
militia
may
be
called
forth
in
whole
or
in
part
into
the
confederate
service
but
do
not
thereby
become
part
of
the
raised
by
congress
they
remain
militia
and
go
home
when
the
emergency
which
provoked
their
call
has
ceased
armies
raised
by
congress
are
of
course
raised
out
of
the
as
the
militia
organized
by
the
states
and
to
deny
to
congress
the
power
to
draft
a
citizen
into
the
army
or
to
receive
his
voluntary
offer
of
services
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
state
militia
is
to
deny
the
power
to
raise
an
army
at
all
for
practically
all
men
fit
for
service
in
the
army
may
be
embraced
in
the
militia
organization
of
the
several
states
you
seem
however
to
suggest
rather
than
directly
to
assert
that
the
conscript
law
may
be
unconstitutional
because
it
comprehends
all
men
between
eighteen
and
years
at
least
this
is
an
inference
which
i
draw
from
your
expression
composed
of
the
militia
of
the
states
but
it
is
obvious
that
if
congress
have
power
to
draft
into
the
armies
raised
by
it
any
citizens
at
all
without
regard
to
the
fact
whether
they
are
or
not
members
of
militia
organizations
the
power
must
be
coextensive
with
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
or
it
becomes
illusory
and
the
extent
of
the
exigency
must
be
determined
by
congress
for
the
constitution
has
left
the
power
without
any
other
check
or
restriction
than
the
executive
veto
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
power
thus
delegated
to
congress
is
scarcely
felt
by
the
states
at
the
present
moment
when
our
very
existence
is
threatened
by
armies
vastly
superior
in
numbers
to
ours
the
necessity
for
defense
has
induced
a
call
not
for
whole
militia
of
all
the
states
not
for
any
militia
but
for
men
to
compose
for
the
confederate
states
surely
there
is
no
mystery
in
this
subject
during
our
whole
past
history
as
well
as
during
our
recent
one
year
experience
as
a
new
confederacy
the
militia
been
called
forth
to
repel
invasion
in
numerous
instances
and
they
never
came
otherwise
than
as
bodies
organized
by
the
states
with
their
company
field
and
and
when
the
emergency
had
passed
they
went
home
again
i
can
not
perceive
how
any
one
can
interpret
the
conscription
law
as
taking
away
from
the
states
the
power
to
appoint
officers
to
their
militia
you
observe
on
this
point
in
your
letter
that
unless
your
construction
is
adopted
very
object
of
the
states
in
reserving
the
power
of
appointing
the
officers
is
defeated
and
that
portion
of
the
constitution
is
not
only
a
nullity
but
the
whole
military
power
of
the
states
and
the
entire
control
of
the
militia
with
the
appointment
of
the
officers
is
vested
in
the
confederate
government
whenever
it
chooses
to
call
its
own
action
raising
an
army
and
not
calling
forth
the
militia
i
can
only
say
in
reply
to
this
that
the
power
of
congress
depends
on
the
real
nature
of
the
act
it
proposes
to
perform
not
on
the
name
given
to
it
and
i
have
endeavored
to
show
that
its
action
is
really
that
of
an
army
and
bears
no
semblance
to
forth
the
militia
i
think
i
may
safely
venture
the
assertion
that
there
is
not
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
of
those
who
will
do
service
under
the
conscription
act
that
will
describe
himself
while
in
the
confederate
service
as
being
a
militiaman
and
if
i
am
right
in
this
assumption
the
popular
understanding
concurs
entirely
with
my
own
deductions
from
the
constitution
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
my
answer
has
grown
to
such
a
length
that
i
must
confine
myself
to
one
more
quotation
from
your
letter
you
proceed
shall
have
power
to
how
shall
it
be
done
the
answer
is
clear
in
conformity
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
expressly
provides
that
when
the
militia
of
the
states
are
called
forth
to
and
employed
in
the
service
of
the
confederate
states
which
is
now
the
case
the
state
shall
appoint
the
officers
i
beg
you
to
observe
that
the
answer
which
you
say
is
clear
is
not
an
answer
to
the
question
put
the
question
is
how
are
armies
to
be
raised
the
answer
given
is
that
when
militia
are
called
upon
to
repel
invasion
the
state
shall
appoint
the
officers
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
conclusive
test
on
this
whole
subject
by
our
constitution
congress
may
declare
war
as
well
as
it
may
acquire
territory
now
suppose
that
for

it

we

i
find
just
reason
to
distrust
the

jefferson

the
operation
of
this
law
was
suspended
in
the
states
of
kentucky
missouri
and
maryland
because
of
their
occupation
by
the
armies
of
the
federal
government
the
opposition
to
it
where
its
execution
was
continued
soon
became
limited
and
before
june
its
good
effects
were
seen
in
the
increased
strength
and
efficiency
of
our
armies
at
the
same
time
i
was
authorized
to
commission
officers
to
form
bands
of
partisan
rangers
either
of
infantry
or
cavalry
which
were
subsequently
confined
to
cavalry
alone
on
september
all
white
men
between
the
ages
of
and
were
placed
in
the
military
service
for
three
years
all
persons
subject
to
enrollment
might
be
enrolled
wherever
found
and
were
made
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
law
authority
was
also
given
for
the
reception
of
volunteers
from
the
states
in
which
the
law
was
suspended
on
february
it
was
enacted
by
congress
that
all
white
men
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
fifty
should
be
in
the
military
service
for
the
war
also
that
all
then
in
the
service
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
should
be
retained
during
the
war
an
enrollment
was
also
ordered
of
all
persons
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
eighteen
and
between
and
fifty
years
who
should
constitute
a
reserve
for
state
defense
and
detail
duty
on
february
all
male
free
negroes
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
fifty
years
were
made
liable
to
perform
duties
with
the
army
or
in
connection
with
the
military
defenses
of
the
country
in
the
way
of
work
upon
the
fortifications
or
in
government
works
for
the
production
or
preparation
of
materials
of
war
or
in
military
hospitals
the
secretary
of
war
was
also
authorized
to
employ
for
the
same
duties
any
number
of
negro
slaves
not
exceeding
twenty
thousand
in
the
operation
of
the
military
laws
we
found
the
exemption
from
military
duty
accorded
by
the
law
to
all
persons
engaged
in
certain
specified
pursuits
or
professions
to
be
unwise
indeed
it
seems
to
be
indefensible
in
theory
the
defense
of
home
family
and
country
is
universally
recognized
as
the
paramount
political
duty
of
every
member
of
society
and
in
a
form
of
government
where
each
citizen
enjoys
an
equality
of
rights
and
privileges
nothing
can
be
more
invidious
than
an
unequal
distribution
of
duties
or
obligations
no
pursuit
nor
position
should
relieve
any
one
who
is
able
to
do
active
duty
from
enrollment
in
the
army
unless
his
functions
or
services
are
more
useful
to
the
defense
of
his
country
in
another
sphere
but
the
exemption
from
service
of
entire
classes
should
be
wholly
abandoned
the
act
of
february
above
mentioned
which
authorized
the
employment
of
slaves
produced
less
results
than
had
been
anticipated
it
however
brought
forward
the
question
of
the
employment
of
the
negroes
as
soldiers
in
the
army
which
was
warmly
advocated
by
some
and
as
ardently
opposed
by
others
my
own
views
upon
it
were
expressed
freely
and
frequently
in
intercourse
with
members
of
congress
and
emphatically
in
my
message
of
november
when
urging
upon
congress
the
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
a
radical
modification
of
the
theory
of
the
law
i
said
viewed
merely
as
property
and
therefore
as
the
subject
of
impressment
the
service
or
labor
of
the
slave
has
been
frequently
claimed
for
short
periods
in
the
construction
of
defensive
works
the
slave
however
bears
another
relation
to
the
state
that
of
a
person
the
law
of
last
february
contemplates
only
the
relation
of
the
slave
to
the
master
and
limits
the
impressment
to
a
certain
term
of
service
but
for
the
purposes
enumerated
in
the
act
instruction
in
the
manner
of
camping
marching
and
packing
trains
is
needful
so
that
even
in
this
limited
employment
length
of
service
adds
greatly
to
the
value
of
the
negro
labor
hazard
is
also
encountered
in
all
the
positions
to
which
negroes
can
be
assigned
for
service
with
the
army
and
the
duties
required
of
them
demand
loyalty
and
zeal
in
this
aspect
the
relation
of
person
predominates
so
far
as
to
render
it
doubtful
whether
the
private
right
of
property
can
consistently
and
beneficially
be
continued
and
it
would
seem
proper
to
acquire
for
the
public
service
the
entire
property
in
the
labor
of
the
slave
and
to
pay
therefor
due
compensation
rather
than
to
impress
his
labor
for
short
terms
and
this
the
more
especially
as
the
effect
of
the
present
law
would
vest
this
entire
property
in
all
cases
where
the
slave
might
be
recaptured
after
compensation
for
his
loss
had
been
paid
to
the
private
owner
whenever
the
entire
property
in
the
service
of
a
slave
is
thus
acquired
by
the
government
the
question
is
presented
by
what
tenure
he
should
be
held
should
he
be
retained
in
servitude
or
should
his
emancipation
be
held
out
to
him
as
a
reward
for
faithful
service
or
should
it
be
granted
at
once
on
the
promise
of
such
service
and
if
emancipated
what
action
should
be
taken
to
secure
for
the
freed
man
the
permission
of
the
state
from
which
he
was
drawn
to
reside
within
its
limits
after
the
close
of
his
public
service
the
permission
would
doubtless
be
more
readily
accorded
as
a
reward
for
past
faithful
service
and
a
double
motive
for
zealous
discharge
of
duty
would
thus
be
offered
to
those
employed
by
the
government
their
freedom
and
the
gratification
of
the
local
attachment
which
is
so
marked
a
characteristic
of
the
negro
and
forms
so
powerful
an
incentive
to
his
action
the
policy
of
engaging
to
liberate
the
negro
on
his
discharge
after
service
faithfully
rendered
seems
to
me
preferable
to
that
of
granting
immediate
manumission
or
that
of
retaining
him
in
servitude
if
this
policy
should
commend
itself
to
the
judgment
of
congress
it
is
suggested
that
in
addition
to
the
duties
heretofore
performed
by
the
slave
he
might
be
advantageously
employed
as
a
pioneer
and
engineer
laborer
and
in
that
event
that
the
number
should
be
augmented
to
forty
thousand
beyond
this
limit
and
these
employments
it
does
not
seem
to
me
desirable
under
existing
circumstances
to
go
a
broad
moral
distinction
exists
between
the
use
of
slaves
as
soldiers
in
defense
of
their
homes
and
the
incitement
of
the
same
persons
to
insurrection
against
their
masters
the
one
is
justifiable
if
necessary
the
other
is
iniquitous
and
unworthy
of
civilized
people
and
such
is
the
judgment
of
all
writers
on
public
law
as
well
as
that
expressed
and
insisted
on
by
our
enemies
in
all
wars
prior
to
that
now
waged
against
us
by
none
have
the
practices
of
which
they
are
now
guilty
been
denounced
with
greater
severity
than
by
themselves
in
the
two
wars
with
great
britain
in
the
last
and
in
the
present
century
and
in
the
declaration
of
independence
in
when
an
enumeration
was
made
of
the
wrongs
which
justified
the
revolt
from
great
britain
the
climax
of
atrocity
was
deemed
to
be
reached
only
when
the
english
monarch
was
denounced
as
having
domestic
insurrection
among
us
the
subject
is
to
be
viewed
by
us
therefore
solely
in
the
light
of
policy
and
our
social
economy
when
so
regarded
i
must
dissent
from
those
who
advise
a
general
levy
and
arming
of
the
slaves
for
the
duty
of
soldiers
until
our
white
population
shall
prove
insufficient
for
the
armies
we
require
and
can
afford
to
keep
in
the
field
to
employ
as
a
soldier
the
negro
who
has
merely
been
trained
to
labor
and
as
a
laborer
the
white
man
accustomed
from
his
youth
to
the
use
of
arms
would
scarcely
be
deemed
wise
or
advantageous
by
any
and
this
is
the
question
now
before
us
but
should
the
alternative
ever
be
presented
of
subjugation
or
of
the
employment
of
the
slave
as
a
soldier
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
what
should
then
be
our
decision
whether
our
view
embraces
what
would
in
so
extreme
a
case
be
the
sum
of
misery
entailed
by
the
dominion
of
the
enemy
or
be
restricted
solely
to
the
effect
upon
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
negro
population
themselves
the
result
would
be
the
same
the
appalling
demoralization
suffering
disease
and
death
which
have
been
caused
by
partially
substituting
the
invaders
system
of
police
for
the
kind
relation
previously
subsisting
between
the
master
and
slave
have
been
a
sufficient
demonstration
that
external
interference
with
our
institution
of
domestic
slavery
is
productive
of
evil
only
if
the
subject
involved
no
other
consideration
than
the
mere
right
of
property
the
sacrifices
heretofore
made
by
our
people
have
been
such
as
to
permit
no
doubt
of
their
readiness
to
surrender
every
possession
in
order
to
secure
independence
but
the
social
and
political
question
which
is
exclusively
under
the
control
of
the
several
states
has
a
far
wider
and
more
enduring
importance
than
that
of
pecuniary
interest
in
its
manifold
phases
it
embraces
the
stability
of
our
republican
institutions
resting
on
the
actual
political
equality
of
all
its
citizens
and
includes
the
fulfillment
of
the
task
which
has
been
so
happily
begun
that
of
christianizing
and
improving
the
condition
of
the
africans
who
have
by
the
will
of
providence
been
placed
in
our
charge
comparing
the
results
of
our
own
experience
with
those
of
the
experiments
of
others
who
have
borne
similar
relations
to
the
african
race
the
people
of
the
several
states
of
the
confederacy
have
abundant
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
past
and
to
use
the
greatest
circumspection
in
determining
their
course
these
considerations
however
are
rather
applicable
to
the
improbable
contingency
of
our
need
of
resorting
to
this
element
of
assistance
than
to
our
present
condition
if
the
recommendation
above
made
for
the
training
of
forty
thousand
negroes
for
the
service
indicated
shall
meet
your
approval
it
is
certain
that
even
this
limited
number
by
their
preparatory
training
in
intermediate
duties
would
form
a
more
valuable
reserve
force
in
case
of
urgency
than
threefold
their
number
suddenly
called
from
while
a
fresh
levy
could
to
a
certain
extent
supply
their
places
in
the
special
service
for
which
they
are
now
employed
subsequent
events
advanced
my
views
from
a
prospective
to
a
present
need
for
the
enrollment
of
negroes
to
take
their
place
in
the
ranks
strenuously
i
argued
the
question
with
members
of
congress
who
called
to
confer
with
me
to
a
member
of
the
senate
the
house
in
which
we
most
needed
a
vote
i
stated
as
i
had
done
to
many
others
the
fact
of
having
led
negroes
against
a
lawless
body
of
armed
white
men
and
the
assurance
which
the
experiment
gave
me
that
they
might
under
proper
conditions
be
relied
on
in
battle
and
finally
used
to
him
the
expression
which
i
believe
i
can
repeat
exactly
if
the
confederacy
falls
there
should
be
written
on
its
tombstone
of
a
theory
general
lee
was
brought
before
a
committee
to
state
his
opinion
as
to
the
probable
efficiency
of
negroes
as
soldiers
and
disappointed
the
probable
expectation
by
his
unqualified
advocacy
of
the
proposed
measure
after
much
discussion
in
congress
a
bill
authorizing
the
president
to
ask
for
and
accept
from
their
owners
such
a
number
of
negro
men
as
he
might
deem
expedient
subsequently
passed
the
house
but
was
lost
in
the
senate
by
one
vote
the
senators
of
virginia
opposed
the
measure
so
strongly
that
only
legislative
instruction
could
secure
their
support
of
it
their
legislature
did
so
instruct
them
and
they
voted
for
it
finally
the
bill
passed
with
an
amendment
providing
that
not
more
than
per
cent
of
the
male
slaves
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
should
be
called
out
but
the
passage
of
the
act
had
been
so
long
delayed
that
the
opportunity
was
lost
there
did
not
remain
time
enough
to
obtain
any
result
from
its
provisions

another

fulfillment

which
the

propitious
an
unusually
long
exemption
from

into

close
and
mutual
dependence

foretold
unshackled

appeared
a
rainbow
which
promised
that
the
waters
of
national
jealousy
and
proscription
were
about
to
recede
from
the
earth
for
ever
and
the
spirit
of
free
trade
to
move
over
the
face
thereof
in
perspective
we
saw
the
ports
of
california
united
to
the
ports
and
forests
of

and
our
countrymen
commanding
the
trade
of

at

endangered
by
the
impatience
of
petty
ambition
the
promptings
of
sectional
interest
or
the
goadings
of
fanatic
hate
shall
the
good
of
the
whole
be
surrendered
to
the
voracious
demands
of
the
few
shall
class
interests
control
the
great
policy
of
our
country
and
the
voice
of
reason
be
drowned
in
the
clamor
of
causeless
excitement
if
so
not
otherwise
we
may
agree
with
him
who
would
reconcile
us
to
the
evils
of
war
by
the
promise
of
emancipation
from
the
manufacturers
of
manchester
and
birmingham
or
leave
unanswered
the
heresy
boldly
announced
though
by
history
condemned
that
war
is
the
purifier
blood
is
the
aliment
of
free
institutions
sir
it
is
true
that
republics
have
often
been
cradled
in
war
but
more
often
they
have
met
with
a
grave
in
that
cradle
peace
is
the
interest
the
policy
the
nature
of
a
popular
government
war
may
bring
benefits
to
a
few
but
privation
and
loss
are
the
lot
of
the
many
an
appeal
to
arms
should
be
the
last
resort
and
only
by
national
rights
or
national
honor
can
it
be
justified
to
those
who
have
treated
this
as
a
case
involving
the
national
honor
i
reply
that
whenever
that
question
shall
justly
be
raised
i
trust
an
american
congress
will
not
delay
for
weeks
to
discuss
the
chances
or
estimate
the
sacrifices
which
its
maintenance
may
cost
but
sir
instead
of
rights
invaded
or
honor
violated
the
question
before
us
is
the
expediency
of
terminating
an
ancient
treaty
which
if
it
be
unwise
it
can
not
be
dishonorable
to
continue
yet
throughout
this
long
discussion
the
recesses
and
vaulted
dome
of
this
hall
have
reëchoed
to
inflammatory
appeals
and
violent
declamations
on
the
sanctity
of
national
honor
and
then
as
if
to
justify
them
followed
reflections
most
discreditable
to
the
conduct
of
our
government
the
charge
made
elsewhere
has
been
repeated
here
that
we
have
trodden
upon
mexico
but
cowered
under
england
sir
it
has
been
my
pride
to
believe
that
our
history
was
unstained
by
an
act
of
injustice
or
of
perfidy
that
we
stood
recorded
before
the
world
as
a
people
haughty
to
the
strong
generous
to
the
weak
and
nowhere
has
this
character
been
more
exemplified
than
in
our
intercourse
with
mexico
we
have
been
referred
to
the
treaty
of
peace
that
closed
our
last
war
with
great
britain
and
told
that
our
injuries
were
unredressed
because
the
question
of
impressment
was
not
decided
there
are
other
decisions
than
those
made
by
commissioners
and
sometimes
they
outlast
the
letter
of
a
treaty
on
sea
and
land
we
settled
the
question
of
impressment
before
negotiations
were
commenced
at
ghent
further
it
should
be
remembered
that
there
was
involved
within
that
question
a
cardinal
principle
of
each
government
the
power
of
expatriation
and
its
sequence
naturalization
were
denied
by
great
britain
and
hence
a
right
asserted
to
impress
britons
though
naturalized
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
this
violated
a
principle
which
lies
at
the
foundation
of
our
institutions
and
could
never
be
permitted
but
not
being
propagandists
we
could
afford
to
leave
the
political
opinion
unnoticed
after
having
taught
a
lesson
which
would
probably
prevent
any
future
attempt
to
exercise
it
to
our
injury
let
the
wisdom
of
that
policy
be
judged
by
subsequent
events
davis
then
proceeded
to
state
and
argue
at
length
the
historical
questions
involved
making
copious
citations
from
original
authorities
he
continued
waiving
the
consideration
of
any
sinister
motive
or
sectional
hate
which
may
have
brought
allies
to
the
support
of
the
resolution
now
before
us
i
will
treat
it
as
simply
aiming
at
the
object
which
in
common
we
desire
to
secure
the
whole
of
oregon
to
the
united
states
thus
considered
the
dissolution
of
the
oregon
convention
becomes
a
mere
question
of
time
as
a
friend
to
the
extension
of
our
union
and
therefore
prone
to
insist
upon
its
territorial
claims
i
have
thought
this
movement
premature
that
we
should
have
put
ourselves
in
the
strongest
attitude
for
the
enforcement
of
our
claims
before
we
fixed
a
day
on
which
negotiations
should
be
terminated
that
nation
negotiates
to
most
advantage
which
is
best
prepared
for
war
gentlemen
have
treated
the
idea
of
preparation
for
war
as
synonymous
with
the
raising
of
an
army
it
is
not
so
indeed
that
is
the
last
measure
and
should
only
be
resorted
to
when
war
has
become
inevitable
and
then
a
very
short
time
will
always
be
i
trust
sufficient
but
sir
there
are
preparations
which
require
years
and
can
only
be
made
in
a
state
of
peace
such
are
the
fortifications
of
the
salient
points
and
main
entrances
of
our
coast
for
years
southern
men
have
urged
the
occupation
of
the
tortugas
are
those
who
have
so
long
opposed
appropriations
for
that
purpose
ready
to
grant
them
now
in
such
profusion
that
the
labor
of
three
years
may
be
done
in
one
no
sir
the
occasion
by
increasing
the
demand
for
money
elsewhere
must
increase
the
opposition
that
rock
which
nature
placed
like
a
sentinel
to
guard
the
entrance
into
the
mediterranean
of
our
continent
and
which
should
be
to
watch
it
will
stand
without
an
embrasure
to
look
through
how
is
the
case
in
oregon
our
settlements
there
must
be
protected
and
under
present
circumstances
an
army
of
operations
in
that
country
must
draw
its
food
from
this
but
we
have
not
a
sufficient
navy
to
keep
open
a
line
of
communication
by
sea
around
cape
horn
and
the
rugged
route
and
the
great
distance
forbid
the
idea
of
supplying
it
by
transportation
across
the
mountains
now
let
us
see
what
time
and
the
measures
more
pointedly
recommended
by
the
president
would
effect
our
jurisdiction
extended
into
oregon
the
route
guarded
by
stockades
and
troops
a
new
impulse
would
be
given
to
immigration
and
in
two
or
three
years
the
settlement
on
the
willamette
might
grow
into
a
colony
whose
flocks
and
herds
and
granaries
would
sustain
an
army
whenever
one
should
be
required
by
agencies
among
the
indian
tribes
that
effective
ally
of
great
britain
which
formerly
she
has
not
scrupled
to
employ
would
be
rendered
friendly
to
our
people
in
the
mean
time
roads
could
be
constructed
for
the
transportation
of
munitions
of
war
then
we
should
be
prepared
to
assert
and
effectively
maintain
our
claims
to
their
ultimate
limits
i
could
not
depreciate
my
countrymen
i
would
not
vaunt
the
prowess
of
an
enemy
but
sir
i
tell
those
gentlemen
who
in
this
debate
have
found
it
so
easy
to
drive
british
troops
out
of
oregon
that
between
england
and
the
united
states
if
hostilities
occur
in
that
remote
territory
the
party
must
succeed
which
has
bread
within
the
country
chairman
unfortunately
the
opinion
has
gone
forth
that
no
politician
dares
to
be
the
advocate
of
peace
when
the
question
of
war
is
mooted
that
will
be
an
evil
hour
the
sand
of
our
republic
will
be
nearly
run
when
it
shall
be
in
the
power
of
any
demagogue
or
fanatic
to
raise
a
and
control
the
legislation
of
the
country
the
evils
of
war
must
fall
upon
the
people
and
with
them
the
should
originate
we
their
representatives
are
but
a
mirror
to
reflect
the
light
and
never
should
become
a
torch
to
fire
the
pile
but
sir
though
gentlemen
go
torch
in
hand
among
combustible
materials
they
still
declare
there
is
no
danger
of
a
fire
and
measures
threatening
war
are
mingled
with
profuse
assurances
of
peace
sir
we
can
not
expect
we
should
not
require
our
adversary
to
submit
to
more
than
we
would
bear
and
i
ask
after
the
notice
has
been
given
and
the
twelve
months
have
expired
who
would
allow
great
britain
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
oregon
if
we
would
resist
such
act
by
force
of
arms
before
ourselves
performing
it
we
should
prepare
for
war
some
advocates
of
this
immediate
notice
have
urged
their
policy
by
reference
to
a
resolution
of
the
democratic
baltimore
convention
and
contended
that
the
question
was
thereby
closed
to
members
of
the
democratic
party
that
resolution
does
not
recommend
immediate
notice
but
recommends
the
reannexation
of
texas
and
the
reoccupation
of
oregon
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
the
claim
is
strongly
made
to
the
whole
of
oregon
and
the
resolution
seems
directed
more
pointedly
to
space
than
time
texas
and
oregon
were
united
in
the
resolution
and
had
there
been
a
third
question
involving
our
territorial
extension
i
doubt
not
it
would
have
been
united
with
the
other
two
the
addition
of
territory
to
our
union
is
part
of
the
democratic
faith
and
properly
was
placed
in
the
declaration
of
our
policy
at
that
time
to
determine
whether
that
practicable
period
has
arrived
is
now
the
question
and
those
who
cordially
agree
upon
the
principle
of
territorial
enlargement
have
differed
and
may
continue
still
to
differ
on
that
question
sir
though
it
is
demonstrable
that
haste
may
diminish
but
can
not
increase
our
chances
to
secure
the
whole
of
oregon
yet
because
southern
men
have
urged
the
wisdom
of
delay
we
have
had
injurious
comparisons
instituted
between
our
conduct
on
texas
annexation
and
oregon
occupation
is
there
such
equality
between
the
cases
that
the
same
policy
must
apply
to
each
texas
was
peopled
the
time
was
present
when
it
must
be
acquired
or
the
influences
active
to
defeat
our
annexation
purpose
would
probably
succeed
and
the
country
be
lost
to
us
for
ever
oregon
is
with
a
small
exception
still
a
wilderness
our
claim
to
ultimate
sovereignty
can
not
be
weakened
during
the
continuance
of
the
oregon
convention
that
partnership
has
robbed
us
of
the
advantages
which
an
early
occupation
would
have
given
to
our
people
in
the
of
the
country
and
we
are
now
rapidly
advancing
to
a
position
from
which
we
can
command
the
entire
territory
in
texas
annexation
we
were
prompted
by
other
and
higher
considerations
than
mere
interest
texas
had
been
a
member
of
our
family
in
her
infancy
had
been
driven
from
the
paternal
roof
surrendered
to
the
government
of
harsh
inquisitorial
spain
but
true
to
her
lineage
preserved
the
faith
of
opposition
to
monarchical
oppression
she
now
returned
and
asked
to
be
admitted
to
the
hearth
of
the
homestead
she
pointed
to
the
band
of
noble
sons
who
stood
around
her
and
said
here
is
the
remnant
of
my
family
the
rest
i
gave
a
sacrifice
at
the
altar
of
our
fathers
god
the
god
of
liberty
one
two
three
of
the
elder
sisters
strove
hard
to
close
the
door
upon
her
but
the
generous
sympathy
the
justice
of
the
family
threw
it
wide
open
and
welcomed
her
return
such
was
the
case
of
texas
is
there
a
parallel
in
oregon
but
who
are
those
that
arraign
the
south
imputing
to
us
motives
of
sectional
aggrandizement
generally
the
same
who
resisted
texas
annexation
and
now
most
eagerly
press
on
the
immediate
occupation
of
the
whole
of
oregon
the
source
is
worthy
the
suspicion
these
were
the
men
whose
constitutional
scruples
resisted
the
admission
of
a
country
gratuitously
offered
to
us
but
who
now
look
forward
to
gaining
canada
by
conquest
these
the
same
who
claim
a
weight
to
balance
texas
while
they
attack
others
as
governed
by
sectional
considerations
sir
this
doctrine
of
a
political
balance
between
different
sections
of
our
union
is
not
of
southern
growth
we
advocated
the
annexation
of
texas
as
a
great
national
measure
we
saw
in
it
the
extension
of
the
principles
intrusted
to
our
care
and
if
in
the
progress
of
the
question
it
assumed
a
sectional
hue
the
coloring
came
from
the
opposition
that
it
met
an
opposition
based
not
upon
a
showing
of
the
injury
it
would
bring
to
them
but
upon
the
supposition
that
benefits
would
be
obtained
by
us
why
is
it
that
texas
is
referred
to
and
treated
as
a
southern
measure
merely
though
its
northern
latitude
is
and
why
has
the
west
so
often
been
reminded
of
its
services
upon
texas
annexation
is
it
to
divide
the
south
and
west
if
so
let
those
who
seek
this
object
cease
from
their
travail
for
their
end
can
never
be
obtained
a
common
agricultural
interest
unites
us
in
a
common
policy
and
the
hand
that
sows
seeds
of
dissension
between
us
will
find
if
they
spring
from
the
ground
that
the
foot
of
fraternal
intercourse
will
tread
them
back
to
earth
the
streams
that
rise
in
the
west
flow
on
and
are
accumulated
into
the
rivers
of
the
south
they
bear
the
products
of
one
to
the
other
and
bind
the
interests
of
the
whole
indissolubly
together
the
wishes
of
the
one
wake
the
sympathies
of
the
other
on
texas
annexation
the
voice
of
mississippi
found
an
echo
in
the
west
and
mississippi
reëchoes
the
call
of
the
west
on
the
question
of
oregon
though
this
government
has
done
nothing
adequate
to
the
defense
of
mississippi
though
by
war
she
has
much
to
lose
and
nothing
to
gain
yet
she
is
willing
to
encounter
it
if
necessary
to
maintain
our
rights
in
oregon
her
legislature
has
recently
so
resolved
and
her
governor
in
a
late
message
says
if
war
comes
to
us
it
will
bring
blight
and
desolation
yet
we
are
ready
for
the
crisis
sir
could
there
be
a
higher
obligation
on
the
representative
of
such
a
people
than
to
restrain
excitement
than
to
oppose
a
policy
that
threatens
an
unnecessary
war
chairman
why
have
such
repeated
calls
been
made
upon
the
south
to
rally
to
the
rescue
when
where
or
how
has
she
been
laggard
or
deserter
in
the
rights
of
man
were
violated
in
the
outrages
upon
the
northern
colonies
and
the
south
united
in
a
war
for
their
defense
in
the
flag
of
our
union
was
insulted
our
sailors
rights
invaded
and
though
the
interests
infringed
were
mainly
northern
war
was
declared
and
the
opposition
to
its
vigorous
prosecution
came
not
from
the
south
we
entered
it
for
the
common
cause
and
for
the
common
cause
we
freely
met
its
sacrifices
if
sir
we
have
not
been
the
war
party
in
peace
neither
have
we
been
the
peace
party
in
war
and
i
will
leave
the
past
to
answer
for
the
future
if
we
have
not
sought
the
acquisition
of
provinces
by
conquest
neither
have
we
desired
to
exclude
from
our
union
such
as
drawn
by
the
magnet
of
free
institutions
have
peacefully
sought
for
admission
from
sire
to
son
has
descended
our
federative
creed
opposed
to
the
idea
of
sectional
conflict
for
private
advantage
and
favoring
the
wider
expanse
of
our
union
if
envy
and
jealousy
and
sectional
strife
are
eating
like
rust
into
the
bonds
our
fathers
expected
to
bind
us
they
come
from
causes
which
our
southern
atmosphere
has
never
furnished
as
we
have
shared
in
the
toils
so
we
have
gloried
in
the
triumphs
of
our
country
in
our
hearts
as
in
our
history
are
mingled
the
names
of
concord
and
camden
and
saratoga
and
lexington
and
plattsburg
and
chippewa
and
erie
and
moultrie
and
new
orleans
and
yorktown
and
bunker
hill
grouped
together
they
form
a
record
of
the
triumphs
of
our
cause
a
monument
of
the
common
glory
of
our
union
what
southern
man
would
wish
it
less
by
one
of
the
northern
names
of
which
it
is
composed
or
where
is
he
who
gazing
on
the
obelisk
that
rises
from
the
ground
made
sacred
by
the
blood
of
warren
would
feel
his
patriot
pride
suppressed
by
local
jealousy
type
of
the
men
the
event
the
purpose
it
commemorates
that
column
rises
stern
even
severe
in
its
simplicity
neither
niche
nor
molding
for
parasite
or
creeping
thing
to
rest
on
composed
of
material
that
defies
the
waves
of
time
and
pointing
like
a
finger
to
the
source
of
noblest
thought
beacon
of
freedom
it
guides
the
present
generation
to
retrace
the
fountain
of
our
years
and
stand
beside
its
source
to
contemplate
the
scene
where
massachusetts
and
virginia
as
stronger
brothers
of
the
family
stood
foremost
to
defend
our
common
rights

nobler
friendship
of
an
earlier
time
yes
sir
and
when
ignorance
led
by
fanatic
hate
and
armed
by
all
uncharitableness
assails
a
domestic
institution
of
the
south
i
try
to
forgive
for
the
sake
of
the
righteous
among
the
wicked
our
natural
allies
the
democracy
of
the
north
thus
sir
i
leave
to
silent
contempt
the
malign
predictions
of
the
member
from
ohio
who
spoke
in
the
early
stage
of
this
discussion
while
it
pleases
me
to
remember
the
manly
and
patriotic
sentiments
of
the
gentleman
who
sits
near
me
mcdowell
and
who
represents
another
portion
of
that
state
in
him
i
recognize
the
feelings
of
our
western
brethren
his
were
the
sentiments
that
accord
with
their
acts
in
the
past
and
which
with
a
few
ignoble
exceptions
i
doubt
not
they
will
emulate
if
again
the
necessity
should
exist
yes
sir
if
ever
they
hear
that
the
invader
foot
has
been
pressed
upon
our
soil
they
will
descend
to
the
plain
like
an
avalanche
rushing
to
bury
the
foe
in
conclusion
i
will
say
that
free
from
any
forebodings
of
evil
above
the
influence
of
taunts
beyond
the
reach
of
treasonable
threats
and
confiding
securely
in
the
wisdom
and
patriotism
of
the
executive
i
shrink
from
the
assertion
of
no
right
and
will
consent
to
no
restrictions
on
the
discretion
of
the
power
of
our
government
appendix
speeches
and
extracts
from
speeches
of
the
author
in
the
senate
of
the

during
the
first
session
of
the
congress
speech
of
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
on
the
resolutions
of
compromise
proposed
by
clay
january
i
do
not
rise
to
continue
the
discussion
but
as
it
has
been
made
an
historical
question
as
to
what
the
position
of
the
senate
was
twelve
years
ago
and
as
with
great
regret
i
see
this
the
conservative
branch
of
the
government
tending
toward
that
fanaticism
which
seems
to
prevail
with
the
majority
in
the
united
states
i
wish
to
read
from
the
journals
of
that
date
the
resolutions
then
adopted
and
to
show
that
they
went
further
than
the
honorable
senator
from
kentucky
has
stated
i
take
it
for
granted
from
the
date
to
which
the
honorable
senator
has
alluded
he
means
the
resolutions
introduced
by
the
honorable
senator
from
south
carolina
calhoun
not
now
in
his
seat
and
to
which
the
senator
from
kentucky
proposed
certain
amendments
of
the
resolutions
introduced
by
the
senator
from
south
carolina
i
will
read
the
fifth
in
the
series
that
to
which
the
honorable
senator
from
kentucky
must
have
alluded
it
is
in
these
words
that
the
intermeddling
of
any
state
or
states
or
their
citizens
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
or
any
of
the
territories
on
the
ground
or
under
the
pretext
that
it
is
immoral
or
sinful
or
the
passage
of
any
act
or
measure
of
congress
with
that
view
would
be
a
direct
and
dangerous
attack
on
the
institutions
of
all
the
slaveholding
states
such
is
the
general
form
of
the
proposition
it
was
variously
modified
but
never
in
my
opinion
improved
on
the
the
fifth
resolution
being
again
under
consideration
clay
of
kentucky
moved
to
amend
the
amendment
by
striking
out
all
after
the
word
resolved
and
insert
that
the
interference
by
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
with
a
view
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
this
district
is
endangering
the
rights
and
security
of
the
people
of
the
district
and
that
any
act
or
measure
of
congress
designed
to
abolish
slavery
in
this
district
would
be
a
violation
of
the
faith
implied
in
the
cessions
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
a
just
cause
of
alarm
to
the
people
of
the
slaveholding
states
and
have
a
direct
and
inevitable
tendency
to
disturb
and
endanger
the
union
that
it
would
be
highly
inexpedient
to
abolish
slavery
within
any
district
of
country
set
apart
for
the
indian
tribes
where
it
now
exists
or
in
florida
the
only
territory
of
the
united
states
in
which
it
now
exists
because
of
the
serious
alarm
and
just
apprehensions
which
would
be
thereby
excited
in
the
states
sustaining
that
domestic
institution
because
the
people
of
that
territory
have
not
asked
it
to
be
done
and
when
admitted
into
the
union
will
be
exclusively
entitled
to
decide
that
question
for
themselves
because
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
spain
of
the
of
february
and
also
because
it
would
be
in
violation
of
a
solemn
compromise
made
at
a
memorable
and
critical
period
in
the
history
of
this
country
by
which
while
slavery
was
prohibited
north
it
was
admitted
south
of
the
line
of
degrees
and
thirty
minutes
north
latitude
but
this
resolution
was
not
finally
adopted
upon
the
motion
of
buchanan
to
amend
said
amendment
by
striking
out
the
second
clause
thereof
commencing
with
the
word
resolved
it
was
determined
in
the
affirmative
and
finally
the
resolution
which
here
follows
was
substituted
in
place
of
the
second
clause
that
the
interference
by
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
with
a
view
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
this
district
is
endangering
the
rights
and
security
of
the
people
of
the
district
and
that
any
act
or
measure
of
congress
designed
to
abolish
slavery
in
this
district
would
be
a
violation
of
the
faith
implied
in
the
cessions
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
a
just
cause
of
alarm
to
the
people
of
the
slaveholding
states
and
have
a
direct
and
inevitable
tendency
to
disturb
and
endanger
the
union
this
was
the
form
in
which
the
resolution
was
finally
adopted
passing
by
a
vote
of
to
eight
here
then
was
fully
and
broadly
asserted
the
danger
resulting
from
the
interference
in
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
trenching
upon
the
rights
of
the
slaveholding
states
twelve
years
only
have
elapsed
yet
this
brief
period
has
swept
away
even
the
remembrance
of
principles
then
deemed
sacred
and
necessary
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
union
now
an
honorable
and
distinguished
senator
to
whom
the
country
has
been
induced
to
look
for
something
that
would
heal
the
existing
dissensions
instead
of
raising
new
barriers
against
encroachment
dashes
down
those
heretofore
erected
and
augments
the
existing
danger
a
representative
from
one
of
the
slaveholding
states
raises
his
voice
for
the
first
time
in
disregard
of
this
admitted
right
nor
president
did
he
stop
here
the
boundary
of
a
state
with
which
we
have
no
more
right
to
interfere
than
with
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
kentucky
is
encroached
upon
the
united
states
sir
as
the
agent
for
texas
had
a
right
to
settle
the
question
of
boundary
between
texas
and
mexico
texas
was
not
annexed
as
a
territory
but
was
admitted
as
a
state
and
at
the
period
of
her
admission
her
boundaries
were
established
by
her
congress
she
by
the
terms
of
annexation
gave
to
the
united
states
the
right
to
define
her
boundary
by
treaty
with
mexico
but
the
united
states
in
the
treaty
made
with
mexico
subsequent
to
the
war
with
that
country
received
from
mexico
not
merely
a
cession
of
the
territory
that
was
claimed
by
texas
but
much
that
lay
beyond
the
asserted
limits
shall
we
then
acting
simply
as
the
cogent
of
texas
in
the
settlement
of
this
question
of
boundary
take
from
the
principal
for
whom
we
act
that
territory
which
belongs
to
her
to
which
we
asserted
her
title
against
mexico
and
appropriate
it
to
ourselves
why
sir
it
would
be
a
violation
of
justice
and
of
a
principle
of
law
which
is
so
plain
that
it
does
not
require
one
to
have
been
bred
to
the
profession
of
law
to
understand
it
the
principle
i
refer
to
is
that
an
agent
can
not
take
for
his
own
benefit
anything
resulting
from
the
matter
in
controversy
after
having
acquired
it
as
belonging
to
the
principal
for
whom
he
acts
the
agent
can
not
appropriate
to
himself
rights
acquired
for
his
client
the
right
of
texas
therefore
to
that
boundary
was
made
complete
by
the
treaty
of
peace
which
silenced
the
only
rival
claim
to
the
territory
it
was
distinctly
defined
by
the
acts
of
her
congress
before
the
time
of
annexation
and
i
have
only
to
refer
to
those
acts
to
show
that
the
boundary
of
texas
was
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
from
its
mouth
to
its
source
what
justice
or
even
decent
regard
for
fairness
can
there
be
now
that
texas
has
acceded
to
annexation
upon
certain
terms
to
propose
a
change
of
boundary
in
violation
of
those
terms
and
by
the
power
we
hold
over
her
as
a
part
of
the
union
can
this
power
extend
so
far
as
to
take
from
her
a
portion
of
her
territory
or
to
assert
that
there
is
a
portion
to
which
she
is
not
entitled
these
constitute
with
me
two
great
objections
to
the
propositions
of
the
honorable
senator
from
kentucky
but
without
stating
all
the
objections
that
i
have
and
they
are
very
many
i
will
merely
point
out
a
few
of
the
prominent
points
to
which
i
object
in
the
argument
of
the
senator
he
assumes
as
facts
things
which
are
mere
matters
of
opinion
and
i
think
of
erroneous
and
injurious
opinion
but
deferring
the
discussion
to
another
occasion
i
desire
at
present
merely
to
notice
the
assertion
of
the
honorable
senator
that
slavery
would
never
under
any
circumstances
be
established
in
california
this
though
stated
as
a
fact
is
but
a
mere
opinion
an
opinion
with
which
i
do
not
accord
it
was
to
work
the
on
this
continent
that
the
spaniards
first
brought
africans
to
the
country
the
european
races
now
engaged
in
working
the
mines
of
california
sink
under
the
burning
heat
and
sudden
changes
of
the
climate
to
which
the
african
race
are
altogether
better
adapted
the
production
of
rice
sugar
and
cotton
is
no
better
adapted
to
than
the
digging
washing
and
quarrying
of
the
we
sir
have
not
asked
that
slavery
should
be
established
in
california
we
have
only
asked
that
there
should
be
no
restriction
that
climate
and
soil
should
be
left
free
to
establish
the
institution
or
not
as
experience
should
determine
sir
after
the
agitation
of
the
subject
within
these
halls
and
elsewhere
has
prevented
the
introduction
of
slavery
by
preventing
the
emigration
of
slaveholders
with
their
property
are
we
now
to
be
told
that
the
question
is
settled
more
than
that
when
we
have
acquired
territory
over
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
thereby
extended
and
which
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
a
right
to
occupy
and
to
establish
therein
what
laws
they
please
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
constitution
in
which
they
have
a
right
to
establish
what
institutions
they
please
it
is
now
claimed
that
the
municipal
regulations
which
previously
existed
shall
still
govern
the
people
and
that
a
portion
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
thus
be
precluded
from
going
there
with
their
property
this
rule
has
however
in
discussion
here
only
been
applied
to
the
property
of
slaveholders
as
though
slaves
were
the
only
property
under
the
laws
of
mexico
prohibited
from
entering
california
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
late
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
a
report
to
congress
stated
that
the
mexican
law
prohibited
the
entrance
of
some
sixty
articles
of
commerce
this
was
prohibition
by
law
of
congress
and
slavery
has
never
been
so
prohibited
it
never
has
been
prohibited
by
the
mexican
congress
in
california
and
the
only
prohibition
ever
issued
was
that
contained
in
the
edict
of
a
usurper
under
the
specious
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
oppose
the
invasion
of
the
country
by
spain
this
decree
was
recognized
by
a
subsequent
congress
so
far
as
to
pass
a
law
authorizing
payment
for
slaves
so
liberated
it
was
the
emancipation
of
all
the
slaves
in
mexico
an
act
if
you
please
of
abolition
not
of
prohibition
not
whatever
construction
may
be
placed
upon
it
done
in
the
forms
of
law
and
requirements
of
their
constitution
but
we
have
not
proposed
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
the
abolition
neither
has
any
southern
man
asked
that
that
decree
should
be
repealed
or
that
those
liberated
under
its
provisions
should
be
returned
to
slavery
we
only
claim
that
there
shall
be
an
equality
of
immunities
and
privileges
among
citizens
of
all
parts
of
the
united
states
that
mexican
law
shall
not
be
applied
so
as
to
create
inequality
between
citizens
by
preventing
the
immigration
of
any
but
sir
we
are
called
on
to
receive
this
as
a
measure
of
compromise
is
a
measure
in
which
we
of
the
minority
are
to
receive
nothing
a
compromise
i
look
upon
it
as
but
a
modest
mode
of
taking
that
the
claim
to
which
has
been
more
boldly
asserted
by
others
and
that
i
may
be
understood
upon
this
question
and
that
my
position
may
go
forth
to
the
country
in
the
same
columns
that
convey
the
sentiments
of
the
senator
from
kentucky
i
here
assert
that
never
will
i
take
less
than
the
missouri
compromise
line
extended
to
the
pacific
ocean
with
the
specific
recognition
of
the
right
to
hold
slaves
in
the
territory
below
that
line
and
that
before
such
territories
are
admitted
into
the
union
as
states
slaves
may
be
taken
there
from
any
of
the
united
states
at
the
option
of
their
owners
i
can
never
consent
to
give
additional
power
to
a
majority
to
commit
further
aggressions
upon
the
minority
in
this
union
and
will
never
consent
to
any
proposition
which
will
have
such
a
tendency
without
a
full
guarantee
or
counteracting
measure
is
connected
with
it
i
forbear
commenting
at
any
further
length
upon
the
propositions
embraced
in
the
resolutions
at
this
time
remarks
of
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
on
the
question
of
the
reception
of
a
memorial
from
inhabitants
of
pennsylvania
and
delaware
presented
by
hale
of
new
hampshire
praying
that
congress
would
adopt
measures
for
an
immediate
and
peaceful
dissolution
of
the
union
february
president
i
rise
merely
to
make
a
few
remarks
upon
the
right
of
petition
and
to
notice
the
error
which
i
think
has
pervaded
the
comparisons
that
have
been
instituted
between
certain
resolutions
which
were
presented
by
the
senator
from
north
carolina
and
the
petition
which
it
is
now
proposed
shall
be
received
the
resolutions
which
were
presented
from
north
carolina
were
published
in
yesterday
paper
and
after
reading
them
i
think
they
refer
to
a
state
of
case
which
the
people
of
north
carolina
might
properly
present
as
their
grievance
they
were
resolutions
for
preserving
the
union
calling
upon
congress
to
take
all
measures
in
its
power
for
that
purpose
this
was
all
legitimate
they
had
a
right
to
petition
congress
for
a
redress
of
grievances
and
if
it
were
in
our
power
to
redress
those
grievances
if
it
were
within
the
legitimate
functions
of
our
legislation
we
were
bound
to
receive
the
petition
and
respectfully
consider
it
this
case
is
exactly
the
reverse
here
is
no
grievance
unless
the
union
is
a
grievance
to
those
who
petition
and
they
call
upon
congress
to
do
that
which
every
one
must
admit
congress
has
no
power
to
do
to
dissolve
peaceably
the
union
of
the
states
then
sir
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
grievance
in
the
next
place
there
is
no
power
and
beyond
all
that
it
is
offensive
to
the
senate
it
is
offensive
to
recommend
legislation
for
the
dissolution
of
the
union
offensive
to
the
senate
and
to
the
whole
country
if
this
union
is
ever
to
be
dissolved
it
must
be
by
the
action
of
the
states
and
their
people
whatever
power
congress
holds
it
bolds
under
the
constitution
and
that
power
is
but
a
part
of
the
union
congress
has
no
power
to
legislate
upon
that
which
will
be
the
destruction
of
the
whole
foundation
upon
which
its
authority
rests
i
recollect
a
good
many
years
ago
that
the
senator
from
massachusetts
john
davis
who
addressed
the
senate
this
morning
very
pointedly
described
the
right
of
petition
as
a
very
humble
right
as
the
mere
right
to
beg
this
is
my
own
view
the
right
peaceably
to
assemble
i
hold
as
the
right
which
it
was
intended
to
grant
to
the
people
that
was
the
only
right
which
had
ever
been
denied
in
our
colonial
condition
the
right
of
petition
had
never
been
denied
by
parliament
it
was
intended
only
to
secure
to
the
people
i
say
the
right
peaceably
to
assemble
whenever
they
choose
to
do
so
with
intent
to
petition
for
a
redress
of
grievances
but
sir
the
right
of
petition
though
but
a
poor
right
the
mere
right
to
beg
may
yet
be
carried
to
such
an
extent
that
we
are
bound
to
abate
it
as
a
nuisance
if
the
avenues
to
the
capitol
were
to
be
obstructed
so
that
members
would
find
themselves
unable
to
reach
the
halls
of
legislation
because
hordes
of
beggars
presented
themselves
in
the
way
calling
for
relief
it
would
be
a
nuisance
that
would
require
to
be
abated
and
congress
in
would
be
compelled
to
remove
them
but
such
a
collection
of
beggars
would
not
be
half
so
great
an
evil
as
the
petitions
presented
here
on
the
subject
of
slavery
they
disturb
the
peace
of
the
country
they
impede
and
pervert
legislation
by
the
excitement
they
create
they
do
more
to
prevent
rational
investigation
and
proper
action
in
this
body
than
any
if
not
all
other
causes
good
if
ever
designed
has
never
resulted
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
suppose
that
good
is
expected
ever
to
flow
from
them
why
then
should
we
be
bound
to
receive
such
petitions
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
business
or
rather
why
are
they
presented
i
am
not
of
those
who
believe
we
should
be
turned
from
the
path
of
duty
by
clamor
or
that
the
evil
can
be
removed
by
partial
concession
to
receive
is
to
give
cause
for
further
demands
and
our
direct
and
safe
course
is
rejection
yes
sir
their
reception
would
serve
only
to
embarrass
congress
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
the
country
and
to
peril
the
union
of
the
states
by
every
obligation
therefore
that
rests
upon
us
under
the
constitution
upon
every
great
principle
upon
which
the
constitution
is
founded
we
are
bound
to
abate
this
as
a
great
and
growing
evil
this
petition
sir
was
well
described
by
the
senator
from
pennsylvania
as
being
spurious
and
i
have
been
assured
of
the
fact
from
other
sources
of
information
that
petitions
are
sent
round
in
reference
to
other
subjects
of
temperance
generally
and
after
a
long
list
of
names
has
been
obtained
the
caption
is
cut
off
and
the
list
of
signatures
attached
to
an
abolition
caption
and
sent
here
to
excite
one
section
of
the
union
against
the
other
to
disturb
the
country
and
distract
the
legislation
of
congress
to
execute
which
we
have
our
seats
in
this
chamber
for
the
reasons
first
stated
i
voted
to
receive
the
resolutions
that
were
presented
by
the
senator
from
north
carolina
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
just
given
shall
vote
to
reject
this
petition
conclusion
of
speech
of
jefferson
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
on
the
resolutions
of
clay
relative
to
slavery
in
the
territories
february
and
sir
it
has
been
asked
on
several
occasions
during
the
present
session
what
ground
of
complaint
has
the
south
is
this
agitation
in
the
two
halls
of
congress
in
relation
to
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
south
no
subject
for
complaint
is
the
denunciation
heaped
upon
us
by
the
press
of
the
north
and
the
attempts
to
degrade
us
in
the
eyes
of
christendom
to
arraign
the
character
of
our
people
and
the
character
of
our
fathers
from
whom
our
institutions
are
derived
no
subject
for
complaint
is
this
sectional
organization
for
the
purpose
of
hostility
to
our
portion
of
the
union
no
subject
for
complaint
would
it
not
between
foreign
nations
nations
not
bound
together
and
restrained
as
we
are
by
compact
would
it
not
i
say
be
just
cause
for
war
what
difference
is
there
between
organizations
for
circulating
incendiary
documents
and
promoting
the
escape
of
fugitives
from
a
neighboring
state
and
the
organization
of
an
armed
force
for
the
purpose
of
invasion
sir
a
state
relying
securely
on
its
own
strength
would
rather
court
the
open
invasion
than
the
insidious
attack
and
for
what
end
sir
is
all
this
aggression
they
see
that
the
slaves
in
their
present
condition
in
the
south
are
comfortable
and
happy
they
see
them
advancing
in
intelligence
they
see
the
kindest
relations
existing
between
them
and
their
masters
they
see
them
provided
for
in
age
and
sickness
in
infancy
and
in
disability
they
see
them
in
useful
employment
restrained
from
the
vicious
indulgences
to
which
their
inferior
nature
inclines
them
they
see
our
penitentiaries
never
filled
and
our
usually
empty
let
them
turn
to
the
other
hand
and
they
see
the
same
race
in
a
state
of
freedom
at
the
north
but
instead
of
the
comfort
and
kindness
they
receive
at
the
south
instead
of
being
happy
and
useful
they
are
with
few
exceptions
miserable
degraded
filling
the
penitentiaries
and
objects
of
scorn
excluded
in
some
places
from
the
schools
and
deprived
of
many
other
privileges
and
benefits
which
attach
to
the
white
men
among
whom
they
live
and
yet
they
insist
that
elsewhere
an
institution
which
has
proved
beneficial
to
this
race
shall
be
abolished
that
it
may
be
substituted
by
a
state
of
things
which
is
fraught
with
so
many
evils
to
the
race
which
they
claim
to
be
the
object
of
their
solicitude
do
they
find
in
the
history
of
domingo
and
in
the
present
condition
of
jamaica
under
the
recent
experiments
which
have
been
made
upon
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
liberation
of
the
blacks
before
god
in
his
wisdom
designed
it
should
be
done
do
they
there
find
anything
to
stimulate
them
to
future
exertion
in
the
cause
of
abolition
or
should
they
not
find
there
satisfactory
evidence
that
their
past
course
was
founded
in
error
and
is
it
not
the
part
of
integrity
and
wisdom
as
soon
as
they
can
to
retrace
their
steps
should
they
not
immediately
cease
from
a
course
mischievous
in
every
stage
and
finally
tending
to
the
greatest
catastrophe
we
may
dispute
about
measures
but
as
long
as
parties
have
nationality
as
long
as
it
is
a
difference
of
opinion
between
individuals
passing
into
every
section
of
the
country
it
threatens
no
danger
to
the
union
if
the
conflicts
of
party
were
the
only
cause
of
apprehension
this
government
might
last
for
ever
the
last
page
of
human
history
might
contain
a
discussion
in
the
american
congress
upon
the
meaning
of
some
phrase
the
extent
of
the
power
conferred
by
some
grant
of
the
constitution
it
is
sir
these
sectional
divisions
which
weaken
the
bonds
of
union
and
threaten
their
final
rupture
it
is
not
differences
of
opinion
it
is
geographical
lines
rivers
and
mountains
which
divide
state
from
state
and
make
different
nations
of
mankind
are
these
no
subjects
of
complaint
for
us
and
do
they
furnish
no
cause
for
repentance
to
you
have
we
not
a
right
to
appeal
to
you
as
brethren
of
this
union
have
we
not
a
right
to
appeal
to
you
as
brethren
bound
by
the
compact
of
our
fathers
that
you
should
with
due
regard
to
your
own
rights
and
interests
and
constitutional
obligations
do
all
that
is
necessary
to
preserve
our
peace
and
promote
our
prosperity
if
sir
the
seeds
of
disunion
have
been
sown
broadcast
over
this
land
i
ask
by
whose
hand
they
have
been
scattered
if
sir
we
are
now
reduced
to
a
condition
when
the
powers
of
this
government
are
held
subservient
to
faction
if
we
can
not
and
dare
not
legislate
for
the
organization
of
territorial
governments
i
ask
sir
who
is
responsible
for
it
and
i
can
with
proud
reliance
say
it
is
not
the
south
it
is
not
the
south
sir
every
charge
of
disunion
which
is
made
on
that
part
of
the
south
which
i
in
part
represent
and
whose
sentiments
i
well
understand
i
here
pronounce
to
be
grossly
calumnious
the
conduct
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
calling
a
convention
has
already
been
introduced
before
the
senate
and
on
that
occasion
i
stated
and
now
repeat
that
it
was
the
result
of
patriotism
and
a
high
resolve
to
preserve
if
possible
our
constitutional
union
that
all
its
proceedings
were
conducted
with
deliberation
and
it
was
composed
of
the
first
men
of
the
state
the
a
man
well
known
for
his
high
integrity
for
his
powerful
intellect
for
his
great
legal
attainments
and
his
ability
in
questions
of
constitutional
over
that
convention
after
calm
and
mature
deliberation
resolutions
were
adopted
not
in
the
spirit
of
disunion
but
announcing
in
the
first
resolution
of
the
series
their
attachment
to
the
union
they
call
on
their
brethren
of
the
south
to
unite
with
them
in
their
holy
purpose
of
preserving
the
constitution
which
is
its
only
bond
and
reliable
hope
this
was
their
object
and
for
this
and
for
no
other
purpose
do
they
propose
to
meet
in
general
convention
at
nashville
as
i
stated
on
a
former
occasion
this
was
not
a
party
movement
in
mississippi
the
presiding
officer
belongs
to
the
political
minority
in
the
state
the
two
parties
in
the
state
were
equally
represented
in
the
numbers
of
the
convention
and
its
deliberations
assumed
no
partisan
or
political
character
whatever
it
was
the
result
of
primary
meetings
in
the
counties
an
assemblage
of
men
known
throughout
the
state
having
first
met
and
intimated
to
those
counties
a
time
when
the
state
convention
should
if
deemed
proper
be
held
every
movement
was
taken
with
deliberation
and
every
movement
then
taken
was
wholly
independent
of
the
action
of
anybody
else
unless
it
be
intended
by
the
remarks
made
here
to
refer
its
action
to
the
great
principles
of
those
who
have
gone
before
us
and
who
have
left
us
the
rich
legacy
of
the
free
institutions
under
which
we
live
if
it
be
attempted
to
assign
the
movement
to
the
nullification
tenets
of
south
carolina
as
my
friend
near
me
seemed
to
understand
then
i
say
you
must
go
further
back
and
impute
it
to
the
state
rights
and
construction
doctrines
of
madison
and
jefferson
you
must
refer
these
in
their
turn
to
the
principles
in
which
originated
the
revolution
and
separation
of
these
then
colonies
from
england
you
must
not
stop
there
but
go
back
still
further
to
the
bold
spirit
of
the
ancient
barons
of
england
that
spirit
has
come
down
to
us
and
in
that
spirit
has
all
the
action
since
been
taken
we
will
not
permit
aggressions
we
will
defend
our
rights
and
if
it
be
necessary
we
will
claim
from
this
government
as
the
barons
of
england
claimed
from
john
the
grant
of
another
for
our
protection
sir
i
can
but
consider
it
as
a
tribute
of
respect
to
the
character
for
candor
and
sincerity
which
the
south
maintains
that
every
movement
which
occurs
in
the
southern
states
is
closely
scrutinized
and
the
assertion
of
a
determination
to
maintain
their
constitutional
rights
is
denounced
as
a
movement
of
disunion
while
violent
denunciations
against
the
union
are
now
made
and
for
years
have
been
made
at
the
north
by
associations
by
presses
and
conventions
yet
are
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
as
the
idle
wind
i
suppose
for
the
simple
reason
that
nobody
believed
there
was
any
danger
in
them
it
is
then
i
say
a
tribute
paid
to
the
sincerity
of
the
south
that
every
movement
of
hers
is
watched
with
such
jealousy
but
what
shall
we
think
of
the
love
for
the
union
of
those
in
whom
this
brings
us
corresponding
change
of
conduct
who
continue
the
wanton
aggravations
which
have
produced
and
justify
the
action
they
deprecate
is
it
well
is
it
wise
is
it
safe
to
disregard
these
manifestations
of
public
displeasure
though
it
be
the
displeasure
of
a
minority
is
it
proper
or
prudent
or
respectful
when
a
representative
in
accordance
with
the
known
will
of
his
constituents
addresses
you
the
language
of
solemn
warning
in
conformity
to
his
duty
to
the
constitution
the
union
and
to
his
own
conscience
that
his
course
should
be
arraigned
as
the
declaration
of
ultra
and
dangerous
opinions
if
these
warnings
were
received
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
are
given
it
would
augur
better
for
the
country
it
would
give
hopes
which
are
now
denied
us
if
the
press
of
the
country
that
great
lever
of
public
opinion
would
enforce
these
warnings
and
bear
them
to
every
cottage
instead
of
heaping
abuse
upon
those
whose
love
of
ease
would
prompt
them
to
silence
whose
speech
therefore
is
evidence
of
sincerity
lightly
and
loosely
representatives
of
southern
people
have
been
denounced
as
disunionists
by
that
portion
of
the
northern
press
which
most
disturbs
the
harmony
and
endangers
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
such
even
has
been
my
own
case
though
the
man
does
not
breathe
at
whose
door
the
charge
of
disunion
might
not
as
well
be
laid
as
at
mine
the
son
of
a
revolutionary
soldier
attachment
to
this
union
was
among
the
first
lessons
of
my
childhood
bred
to
the
service
of
my
country
from
boyhood
to
mature
age
i
wore
its
uniform
through
the
brightest
portion
of
my
life
i
was
accustomed
to
see
our
flag
historic
emblem
of
the
union
rise
with
the
rising
and
fall
with
the
setting
sun
i
look
upon
it
now
with
the
affection
of
early
love
and
seek
to
preserve
it
by
a
strict
adherence
to
the
constitution
from
which
it
had
its
birth
and
by
the
nurture
of
which
its
stars
have
come
so
much
to
outnumber
its
original
stripes
shall
that
flag
which
has
gathered
fresh
glory
in
every
war
and
become
more
radiant
still
by
the
conquest
of
peace
shall
that
flag
now
be
torn
by
domestic
faction
and
trodden
in
the
dust
by
sectional
rivalry
shall
we
of
the
south
who
have
shared
equally
with
you
all
your
toils
all
your
dangers
all
your
adversities
and
who
equally
rejoice
in
your
prosperity
and
your
fame
shall
we
be
denied
those
benefits
guaranteed
by
our
compact
or
gathered
as
the
common
fruits
of
a
common
country
if
so
requires
that
we
should
assert
them
and
as
best
we
may
maintain
that
which
we
could
not
surrender
without
losing
your
respect
as
well
as
our
own
if
sir
this
spirit
of
sectional
aggrandizement
or
if
gentlemen
prefer
this
love
they
bear
the
african
race
shall
cause
the
disunion
of
these
states
the
last
chapter
of
our
history
will
be
a
sad
commentary
upon
the
justice
and
the
wisdom
of
our
people
that
this
union
replete
with
blessings
to
its
own
citizens
and
diffusive
of
hope
to
the
rest
of
mankind
should
fall
a
victim
to
a
selfish
aggrandizement
and
a
prompting
one
portion
of
the
union
to
war
upon
the
domestic
rights
and
peace
of
another
would
be
a
deep
reflection
on
the
good
sense
and
patriotism
of
our
day
and
generation
but
sir
if
this
last
chapter
in
our
history
shall
ever
be
written
the
reflective
reader
will
ask
whence
proceeded
this
hostility
of
the
north
against
the
south
he
will
find
it
there
recorded
that
the
south
in
opposition
to
her
own
immediate
interests
engaged
with
the
north
in
the
unequal
struggle
of
the
revolution
he
will
find
again
that
when
northern
seamen
were
impressed
their
brethren
of
the
south
considered
it
cause
for
war
and
entered
warmly
into
the
contest
with
the
haughty
power
then
claiming
to
be
mistress
of
the
seas
he
will
find
that
the
south
afar
off
unseen
and
unheard
toiling
in
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
had
filled
the
shipping
and
supplied
the
staple
for
manufactures
which
enriched
the
north
he
will
find
that
she
was
the
great
consumer
of
northern
fabrics
that
she
not
only
paid
for
these
their
fair
value
in
the
markets
of
the
world
but
that
she
also
paid
their
increased
value
derived
from
the
imposition
of
revenue
duties
and
if
still
further
he
seeks
for
the
cause
of
this
hostility
it
at
last
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
south
held
the
african
race
in
bondage
being
the
descendants
of
those
who
were
mainly
purchased
from
the
people
of
the
north
and
this
was
the
great
cause
for
this
the
north
claimed
that
the
south
should
be
restricted
from
future
growth
that
around
her
should
be
drawn
as
it
were
a
sanitary
cordon
to
prevent
the
extension
of
a
moral
leprosy
and
if
for
that
it
shall
be
written
that
the
south
resisted
it
would
be
but
in
keeping
with
every
page
she
has
added
to
the
history
of
our
country
it
depends
on
those
in
the
majority
to
say
whether
this
last
chapter
in
our
history
shall
be
written
or
not
it
depends
on
them
now
to
decide
whether
the
strife
between
the
different
sections
shall
be
arrested
before
it
has
become
impossible
or
whether
it
shall
proceed
to
a
final
catastrophe
i
sir
and
i
only
speak
for
myself
am
willing
to
meet
any
fair
proposition
to
settle
upon
anything
which
promises
security
for
the
future
anything
which
assures
me
of
permanent
peace
and
i
am
willing
to
make
whatever
sacrifice
i
may
properly
be
called
on
to
render
for
that
purpose
nor
sir
is
it
a
light
responsibility
if
i
strictly
measured
my
conduct
by
the
late
message
of
the
governor
and
the
recent
expressions
of
opinion
in
my
state
i
should
have
no
power
to
accept
any
terms
save
the
unqualified
admission
of
the
equal
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
south
to
go
into
any
of
the
territories
of
the
united
states
with
any
and
every
species
of
property
held
among
us
i
am
willing
however
to
take
my
share
of
the
responsibility
which
the
crisis
of
our
country
demands
i
am
willing
to
rely
on
the
known
love
of
the
people
i
represent
for
the
whole
country
and
the
abiding
respect
which
i
know
they
entertain
for
the
union
of
these
states
if
sir
i
distrusted
their
attachment
to
our
government
and
if
i
believed
that
they
had
that
restless
spirit
of
disunion
which
has
been
ascribed
to
the
south
i
should
know
full
well
that
i
had
no
such
foundation
as
this
to
rely
upon
no
such
great
reserve
in
the
heart
of
the
people
to
fall
back
upon
in
the
hour
of
accountability
president
is
there
such
incompatibility
of
interest
between
the
two
sections
of
this
country
that
they
can
not
profitably
live
together
does
the
agriculture
of
the
south
injure
the
manufactures
of
the
north
on
the
other
hand
are
they
not
their
and
think
you
if
one
portion
of
the
union
however
great
it
might
be
in
commerce
and
manufactures
was
separated
from
all
the
agricultural
districts
that
it
would
long
maintain
its
supremacy
if
any
one
so
believes
let
him
turn
to
the
written
history
of
commercial
states
let
him
look
upon
the
moldering
palaces
of
venice
let
him
ask
for
the
faded
purple
of
tyre
and
visit
the
ruins
of
carthage
there
he
will
see
written
the
fate
of
every
country
which
rests
its
prosperity
on
commerce
and
manufactures
alone
united
we
have
grown
to
our
present
dignity
and
power
united
we
may
go
on
to
a
destiny
which
the
human
mind
can
not
measure
separated
i
feel
that
it
requires
no
prophetic
eye
to
see
that
the
portion
of
the
country
which
is
now
scattering
the
seeds
of
disunion
to
which
i
have
referred
will
be
that
which
will
suffer
most
grass
will
grow
on
the
pavements
now
worn
by
the
constant
tread
of
the
human
throng
which
waits
on
commerce
and
the
shipping
will
abandon
your
ports
for
those
which
now
furnish
the
staples
of
trade
and
we
who
produce
the
great
staples
upon
which
your
commerce
and
manufactures
rest
we
will
produce
those
staples
still
shipping
will
fill
our
harbors
and
why
may
we
not
found
the
tyre
of
modern
commerce
within
our
own
limits
why
may
we
not
bring
the
manufacturers
to
the
side
of
agriculture
and
commerce
too
the
ready
servant
of
both
but
sir
i
have
no
disposition
to
follow
this
subject
i
certainly
can
derive
no
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
anything
which
can
impair
the
prosperity
of
any
portion
of
this
union
and
i
only
refer
to
it
that
those
who
suppose
we
are
tied
by
interest
or
fear
should
look
the
question
in
the
face
and
understand
that
it
is
mainly
a
feeling
of
attachment
to
the
union
which
has
long
bound
and
now
binds
the
south
but
president
i
ask
senators
to
consider
how
long
affection
can
be
proof
against
such
trial
and
injury
and
provocation
as
the
south
is
continually
receiving
the
case
in
which
this
discrimination
against
the
south
is
attempted
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
introduced
render
it
especially
offensive
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
imagine
the
feeling
with
which
a
southern
soldier
during
the
mexican
war
received
the
announcement
that
the
house
of
representatives
had
passed
that
odious
measure
the
wilmot
proviso
and
that
he
although
then
periling
his
life
abandoning
all
the
comforts
of
home
and
sacrificing
his
interests
was
by
the
legislature
of
his
country
marked
as
coming
from
a
portion
of
the
union
which
was
not
entitled
to
the
equal
benefits
of
whatever
might
result
from
the
service
to
which
he
was
contributing
whatever
power
he
possessed
nor
will
it
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
many
sons
of
the
south
whose
blood
has
stained
those
whose
ashes
now
mingle
with
mexican
earth
that
some
when
they
last
looked
on
the
flag
of
their
country
may
have
felt
their
dying
moments
embittered
by
the
recollection
that
that
flag
cast
not
an
equal
shadow
of
protection
over
the
land
of
their
birth
the
graves
of
their
parents
and
the
homes
of
their
children
so
soon
to
be
orphans
sir
i
ask
northern
senators
to
make
the
case
their
own
to
carry
to
their
own
firesides
the
idea
of
such
intrusion
and
offensive
discrimination
as
is
offered
to
us
realize
these
irritations
so
galling
to
the
humble
so
intolerable
to
the
haughty
and
wake
before
it
is
too
late
from
the
dream
that
the
south
will
tamely
submit
measure
the
consequences
to
us
of
your
assumption
and
ask
yourselves
whether
as
a
free
honorable
and
brave
people
you
would
submit
to
it
it
is
essentially
the
characteristic
of
the
chivalrous
that
they
never
speculate
upon
the
fears
of
any
man
and
i
trust
that
no
such
speculations
will
be
made
upon
the
idea
that
may
be
entertained
in
any
quarter
that
the
south
from
fear
of
her
slaves
is
necessarily
opposed
to
a
dissolution
of
the
union
she
has
no
such
fear
her
slaves
would
be
to
her
now
as
they
were
in
the
revolution
an
element
of
military
strength
i
trust
that
no
speculations
will
be
made
upon
either
the
condition
or
the
supposed
weakness
of
the
south
they
will
bring
sad
disappointments
to
those
who
indulge
them
rely
upon
her
devotion
to
the
union
rely
upon
the
feeling
of
fraternity
she
inherited
and
has
never
failed
to
manifest
rely
upon
the
nationality
and
freedom
from
sedition
which
have
in
all
ages
characterized
an
agricultural
people
give
her
justice
sheer
justice
and
the
reliance
will
never
fail
you
then
president
i
ask
that
some
substantial
proposition
may
be
made
by
the
majority
in
regard
to
this
question
it
is
for
those
who
have
the
power
to
pass
it
to
propose
one
it
is
for
those
who
are
threatening
us
with
the
loss
of
that
which
we
are
entitled
to
enjoy
to
state
if
there
be
any
compromise
what
that
compromise
is
we
are
unable
to
pass
any
measure
if
we
propose
it
therefore
i
have
none
to
suggest
we
are
unable
to
bend
you
to
any
terms
which
we
may
offer
we
are
under
the
ban
of
your
purpose
therefore
from
you
if
from
anywhere
the
proposition
must
come
i
trust
that
we
shall
meet
it
and
bear
the
responsibility
as
becomes
us
that
we
shall
not
seek
to
escape
from
it
that
we
shall
not
seek
to
transfer
to
other
places
or
other
times
or
other
persons
that
responsibility
which
devolves
upon
us
and
i
hope
the
earnestness
which
the
occasion
justifies
will
not
be
mistaken
for
the
ebullition
of
passion
nor
the
language
of
warning
be
construed
as
a
threat
we
can
not
without
the
most
humiliating
confession
of
the
supremacy
of
faction
evade
our
constitutional
obligations
and
our
obligations
under
the
treaty
with
mexico
to
organize
governments
in
the
territories
of
california
and
new
mexico
i
trust
that
we
will
not
seek
to
escape
from
the
responsibility
and
leave
the
country
unprovided
for
unless
by
an
irregular
admission
of
new
states
that
we
will
act
upon
the
good
example
of
washington
in
the
case
of
tennessee
and
of
jefferson
in
the
case
of
louisiana
that
we
will
not
if
we
abandon
those
high
standards
do
more
than
come
down
to
modern
examples
that
we
will
not
go
further
than
to
permit
those
who
have
the
forms
of
government
under
the
constitution
to
assume
sovereignty
over
territory
of
the
united
states
that
we
may
at
least
i
say
assert
the
right
to
know
who
they
are
how
many
they
are
where
they
voted
how
they
voted
and
whose
certificate
is
presented
to
us
of
the
fact
before
it
is
conceded
to
them
to
determine
the
fundamental
law
of
the
country
and
to
prescribe
the
conditions
on
which
other
citizens
of
the
united
states
may
enter
it
to
reach
all
this
knowledge
we
must
go
through
the
intermediate
stage
of
territorial
government
how
will
you
determine
what
is
the
seal
and
who
are
the
officers
of
a
community
unknown
as
an
organized
body
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
the
right
be
admitted
in
that
community
to
usurp
the
sovereignty
over
territory
which
belongs
to
the
states
of
the
union
all
these
questions
must
be
answered
before
i
can
consent
to
any
such
irregular
proceeding
as
that
which
is
now
presented
in
the
case
of
california
president
thanking
the
senate
for
the
patience
they
have
shown
toward
me
i
again
express
the
hope
that
those
who
have
the
power
to
settle
this
distracting
question
those
who
have
the
ability
to
restore
peace
concord
and
lasting
harmony
to
the
united
states
will
give
us
some
substantial
proposition
such
as
magnanimity
can
offer
and
such
as
we
can
honorably
accept
i
being
one
of
the
minority
in
the
senate
and
the
union
have
nothing
to
offer
except
an
assurance
of
coöperation
in
anything
which
my
principles
will
allow
me
to
adopt
and
which
promises
permanent
substantial
security
appendix
speech
of
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
chiefly
in
answer
to
fessenden
of
maine
on
the
message
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
transmitting
to
congress
the
lecompton
constitution
of
kansas
february
i
wish
to
express
not
only
my
concurrence
with
the
message
of
the
president
but
my
hearty
approbation
of
the
high
motive
which
actuated
him
when
he
wrote
it
in
that
paper
breathes
the
sentiment
of
a
patriot
and
it
stands
out
in
bold
contrast
with
the
miserable
slang
by
which
he
was
pursued
this
morning
it
may
serve
the
purposes
of
a
man
who
little
regards
the
union
to
perpetrate
a
joke
on
the
hazard
of
its
dissolution
it
may
serve
the
purpose
of
a
man
who
never
looks
to
his
own
heart
to
find
there
any
impulses
of
honor
to
arraign
everybody
the
president
and
the
supreme
court
and
to
have
them
impeached
and
vilified
on
his
mere
suspicion
it
ill
becomes
such
a
man
to
point
to
southern
institutions
as
to
him
a
moral
leprosy
which
he
is
to
pursue
to
the
end
of
extermination
and
perverting
everything
ancient
and
modern
to
bring
it
tributary
to
his
own
malignant
purposes
not
even
could
that
clause
of
the
constitution
which
refers
to
the
importation
or
migration
of
persons
be
held
up
to
public
consideration
by
the
senator
fessenden
in
a
studied
argument
save
as
a
permission
for
the
then
everything
that
is
most
prominent
in
relation
to
the
protection
of
property
in
that
instrument
he
holds
to
have
been
swept
away
by
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
further
importation
of
africans
the
language
of
that
clause
of
the
constitution
is
far
broader
than
the
importation
of
africans
it
is
not
confined
or
limited
at
all
to
that
subject
it
says
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
shall
not
be
prohibited
by
the
congress
prior
to
the
year
but
a
tax
or
duty
may
be
imposed
on
such
importation
not
exceeding
ten
dollars
for
each
person
that
was
a
power
given
to
congress
far
broader
than
the
and
yet
the
senator
gravely
argues
that
when
that
prohibition
against
the
further
importation
of
africans
took
place
by
act
of
congress
thenceforward
the
constitutional
shield
which
had
been
thrown
over
slave
property
fell
sir
it
is
the
only
private
property
in
the
united
states
which
is
specifically
recognized
in
the
constitution
and
protected
by
it
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
a
higher
and
holier
sentiment
among
the
men
who
represented
the
people
of
this
country
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
the
confederation
when
no
narrow
miserable
prejudice
between
northern
and
southern
men
governed
those
who
ruled
the
states
a
committee
of
three
two
of
whom
were
northern
men
reporting
upon
what
they
considered
the
bad
faith
of
spain
in
florida
in
relation
to
fugitive
slaves
proposed
that
negotiations
should
be
instituted
to
require
spain
to
surrender
as
the
states
did
then
surrender
all
fugitives
escaped
into
their
limits
hamilton
and
sedgwick
from
the
north
and
madison
from
the
south
made
that
report
men
the
loftiness
of
whose
purpose
and
genius
might
put
to
shame
the
puny
efforts
now
made
to
disturb
that
which
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
government
under
which
we
live
a
man
not
knowing
into
what
presence
he
was
introduced
coming
into
this
chamber
might
for
a
large
part
of
this
session
have
supposed
that
here
stood
the
representatives
of
belligerent
states
and
that
instead
of
men
assembled
here
to
confer
together
for
the
common
welfare
for
the
general
good
he
saw
here
ministers
from
states
preparing
to
make
war
upon
each
other
and
then
he
would
have
felt
that
vain
indeed
was
the
vaunting
of
the
prowess
of
one
to
destroy
another
or
if
sir
he
had
known
more
if
he
had
recognized
the
representatives
of
the
states
of
the
union
still
he
would
have
traced
through
this
same
eternal
petty
agitation
about
sectional
success
that
limit
which
can
not
fail
however
the
senator
from
new
york
seward
may
regret
it
to
bring
about
a
result
which
every
man
should
from
his
own
sense
of
honor
feel
when
he
takes
his
seat
in
this
chamber
that
he
is
morally
bound
to
avoid
as
long
as
he
retains
possession
of
his
seat
to
express
myself
more
distinctly
i
hold
that
a
senator
while
he
sits
here
as
the
representative
of
a
state
in
the
federal
government
is
in
the
relation
of
a
minister
to
a
friendly
court
and
that
the
moment
he
sees
this
government
in
hostility
to
his
own
the
day
he
resolves
to
make
war
on
this
government
his
honor
and
the
honor
of
his
state
compel
him
to
vacate
the
seat
he
holds
it
is
a
poor
evasion
for
any
man
to
say
i
make
war
on
the
rights
of
one
whole
section
i
make
war
on
the
principles
of
the
constitution
and
yet
i
uphold
the
union
and
i
desire
to
see
it
protected
undermine
the
foundation
and
still
pretend
that
he
desires
the
fabric
to
stand
common
sense
rejects
it
no
one
will
believe
the
man
who
makes
the
assertion
unless
he
believes
him
under
the
charitable
supposition
that
he
knows
not
what
he
is
doing
sir
we
are
arraigned
day
after
day
as
the
aggressive
power
what
southern
senator
during
this
whole
session
has
attacked
any
portion
or
any
interest
of
the
north
in
what
have
we
now
or
ever
back
to
the
earliest
period
of
our
history
sought
to
deprive
the
north
of
any
advantage
it
possessed
the
whole
charge
is
and
has
been
that
we
seek
to
extend
our
own
institutions
into
the
common
territory
of
the
united
states
well
and
wisely
has
the
president
of
the
united
states
pointed
to
that
common
territory
as
the
joint
possession
of
the
country
jointly
we
held
it
jointly
we
enjoyed
it
in
the
earlier
period
of
our
country
but
when
in
the
progress
of
years
it
became
apparent
that
it
could
not
longer
be
enjoyed
in
peace
the
men
of
that
day
took
upon
themselves
wisely
or
unwisely
a
power
which
the
constitution
did
not
confer
and
by
a
geographical
line
determined
to
divide
the
territories
so
that
the
common
field
which
brothers
could
not
cultivate
in
peace
should
be
held
severally
for
the
benefit
of
each
wisely
or
unwisely
that
law
was
denied
extension
to
the
pacific
ocean
i
was
struck
in
the
course
of
these
debates
to
which
i
have
not
been
in
the
habit
of
replying
to
hear
the
senator
from
new
hampshire
hale
who
so
very
ardently
opposed
the
extension
of
that
line
to
the
pacific
ocean
who
held
it
to
be
a
political
stain
upon
the
history
of
our
country
and
who
would
not
even
allow
the
southern
boundary
of
utah
to
be
the
parallel
of
because
of
the
political
implication
which
was
contained
in
it
the
historical
character
of
the
line
plead
as
he
did
a
few
days
ago
for
the
constitutionality
and
legality
and
for
the
sacred
character
of
that
missouri
compromise
i
for
one
never
believed
congress
had
the
power
to
pass
that
law
yet
as
one
who
was
willing
to
lay
down
much
then
as
i
am
now
to
the
peace
the
harmony
and
the
welfare
of
our
common
country
i
desired
to
see
that
line
extended
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
that
strife
which
now
agitates
the
country
never
renewed
but
with
a
distinct
declaration
go
ye
to
the
right
and
we
will
go
to
the
left
and
we
go
in
peace
and
toward
each
other
those
who
refused
then
to
allow
the
extension
of
that
line
those
who
declared
then
that
it
was
a
violation
of
principle
and
insisted
on
what
they
termed
must
have
stood
with
very
poor
grace
in
the
same
chamber
when
at
a
subsequent
period
the
senator
from
illinois
docoias
bound
by
his
honor
on
account
of
his
previous
course
moved
the
repeal
of
that
line
to
throw
open
kansas
they
must
have
stood
with
very
bad
grace
in
this
presence
to
argue
that
that
line
was
now
sacred
and
must
be
kept
for
ever
the
senator
from
illinois
stood
foremost
as
one
who
was
willing
at
an
early
period
to
sacrifice
his
own
prejudices
and
his
own
interests
if
in
deed
his
interests
be
girt
and
bounded
by
the
limits
of
a
state
by
proposing
to
extend
that
line
of
pacification
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
failing
in
that
then
became
foremost
in
the
advocacy
of
the
doctrine
of
and
upon
that
i
say
he
was
in
honor
bound
to
wipe
out
that
line
and
throw
kansas
open
like
any
other
territory
but
sir
was
it
then
understood
by
the
senator
from
illinois
or
anybody
else
that
throwing
open
the
territory
of
kansas
to
free
emigration
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
marching
of
cohorts
from
one
section
or
another
to
fight
on
that
battle
field
for
mastery
or
did
he
not
rather
think
that
emigration
was
to
be
allowed
to
take
its
course
and
soil
and
climate
be
permitted
to
decide
the
great
question
we
were
willing
to
abide
by
it
we
were
willing
to
leave
natural
causes
to
decide
the
question
though
i
differed
from
the
senator
from
new
york
seward
though
i
did
not
believe
that
natural
causes
if
permitted
to
flow
in
their
own
channel
would
have
produced
any
other
result
than
the
introduction
of
slave
property
into
the
territory
of
kansas
i
am
free
to
admit
that
i
have
not
yet
reached
the
conclusion
that
that
property
would
have
permanently
remained
there
that
is
a
question
which
interest
decides
vermont
would
not
keep
african
slaves
because
they
were
not
valuable
to
her
neither
will
any
population
whose
density
is
so
great
as
to
trade
rapidly
on
the
supply
of
bread
be
willing
to
keep
and
maintain
an
improvident
population
to
feed
them
in
infancy
to
care
for
them
in
sickness
to
protect
them
in
age
and
thus
it
will
be
found
in
the
history
of
nations
that
whenever
population
has
reached
that
density
in
the
temperate
zones
serfdom
villenage
or
slavery
whatever
it
has
been
called
has
disappeared
ours
presents
a
new
problem
one
not
stated
by
those
who
wrote
on
it
in
the
earlier
period
of
our
history
it
is
the
problem
of
a
climate
the
problem
of
malarial
districts
of
staple
products
this
produces
a
result
different
from
that
which
would
be
found
in
the
farming
districts
and
cooler
climates
a
race
suited
to
our
labor
exists
there
why
should
we
care
whether
they
go
into
other
territories
or
not
simply
because
of
the
war
which
is
made
against
our
institutions
simply
because
of
the
want
of
security
which
results
from
the
action
of
our
opponents
in
the
northern
states
had
you
made
no
political
war
upon
us
had
you
observed
the
principles
of
our
confederacy
as
states
that
the
people
of
each
state
were
to
take
care
of
their
domestic
affairs
or
in
the
language
of
the
kansas
bill
to
be
left
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
institutions
in
their
own
way
then
i
say
within
the
limits
of
each
state
the
population
there
would
have
gone
on
to
attend
to
their
own
affairs
and
would
have
had
little
regard
to
whether
this
species
of
property
or
any
other
was
held
in
any
other
portion
of
the
union
you
have
made
it
a
political
war
we
are
on
the
defensive
how
far
are
you
to
push
us
the
senator
from
alabama
clay
has
been
compelled
to
notice
the
resolutions
of
his
state
nor
does
that
state
stand
alone
to
what
issue
are
you
now
pressing
us
to
the
conclusion
that
because
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
slaves
are
held
as
property
a
state
is
to
be
excluded
from
the
union
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
to
the
union
the
union
is
strong
enough
to
confer
favors
it
is
strong
enough
to
command
service
under
these
circumstances
the
man
deserves
but
little
credit
who
sings
pæans
to
its
glory
if
through
a
life
now
not
a
short
one
a
large
portion
of
which
has
been
spent
in
the
public
service
i
have
given
no
better
proof
of
my
affection
for
this
union
than
by
declarations
i
have
lived
to
little
purpose
indeed
i
think
i
have
given
evidence
in
every
form
in
which
patriotism
is
ever
subjected
to
a
test
and
i
trust
whatever
evil
may
be
in
store
for
us
by
those
who
wage
war
on
the
constitution
and
our
rights
under
it
that
i
shall
be
able
to
turn
at
least
to
the
past
and
say
up
to
that
period
when
i
was
declining
into
the
grave
i
served
a
government
i
loved
and
served
it
with
my
whole
heart
nor
will
i
stop
to
compare
services
with
those
gentlemen
who
have
fair
phrases
while
they
undermine
the
very
foundation
of
the
temple
our
fathers
built
if
however
there
be
those
here
who
do
really
love
the
union
and
the
constitution
which
is
the
of
the
union
the
time
has
come
when
we
should
look
calmly
though
steadily
the
danger
which
besets
us
in
the
face
violent
speeches
denunciatory
of
people
in
any
particular
section
of
the
union
the
arraignment
of
institutions
which
they
inherited
and
intend
to
transmit
as
leprous
spots
on
the
are
not
the
means
by
which
fraternity
is
to
be
preserved
or
this
union
rendered
perpetual
these
were
not
the
arguments
which
our
fathers
made
when
through
the
struggles
of
the
revolutionary
war
they
laid
the
foundation
of
the
union
these
are
not
the
principles
on
which
our
constitution
a
bundle
of
compromises
was
made
then
the
navigating
and
the
agricultural
states
did
not
war
to
see
which
could
most
injure
the
other
but
each
conceded
something
from
that
which
it
believed
to
be
its
own
interest
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
other
those
debates
while
they
brought
up
all
that
straggle
which
belongs
to
opposite
interests
and
opposite
localities
show
none
of
that
bitterness
which
so
unfortunately
characterizes
every
debate
in
which
this
body
is
involved
the
meanest
thing
i
do
not
mean
otherwise
than
the
smallest
thing
which
can
arise
among
us
incidentally
runs
into
this
sectional
agitation
as
though
it
were
an
epidemic
and
gave
its
type
to
every
disease
not
even
could
the
committees
of
this
body
when
we
first
assembled
before
any
one
had
the
excuse
of
excitement
to
plead
be
organized
without
sectional
agitation
springing
up
forcibly
i
suppose
gravely
and
sincerely
it
was
contended
here
that
a
great
wrong
was
done
because
new
york
the
great
commercial
state
and
the
emporium
of
commerce
within
her
limits
was
not
represented
upon
the
committee
of
commerce
this
will
go
forth
to
remote
corners
and
descend
perhaps
to
as
an
instance
in
which
the
democratic
party
of
the
senate
behaved
with
unfairness
toward
its
opponents
for
with
it
will
not
descend
the
fact
that
the
democratic
party
only
arranged
for
itself
its
own
portion
of
the
committees
taking
the
control
of
them
and
left
blanks
on
the
committees
to
be
filled
by
the
opposition
that
the
opposition
did
fill
the
blanks
that
the
opposition
had
both
the
senators
from
new
york
but
did
not
choose
to
put
either
of
them
on
that
committee
though
it
afterward
formed
the
basis
and
staple
of
their
complaint
president
i
concur
with
my
friend
from
virginia
hunter
and
when
i
rose
i
did
not
intend
to
consume
anything
like
so
much
time
as
i
have
occupied
i
think
there
are
points
which
have
been
sprung
upon
the
senate
and
heretofore
that
require
to
be
answered
and
to
be
met
like
my
friend
from
virginia
i
shall
feel
that
it
devolves
on
me
as
a
representative
in
part
of
that
constituency
which
is
peculiarly
assailed
on
another
occasion
to
meet
and
if
i
am
able
to
answer
the
allegations
and
accusations
which
have
been
heaped
as
well
on
the
section
in
which
i
live
as
upon
every
man
who
has
performed
his
duty
by
extending
over
them
the
protection
for
which
our
constitution
and
government
were
formed
appendix
in
the
summer
of
davis
being
in
portland
maine
a
vast
concourse
of
its
citizens
assembled
in
front
of
his
hotel
to
offer
him
a
welcome
to
their
city
whereupon
he
made
to
them
an
address
from
which
the
following
extracts
are
given
accept
my
sincere
thanks
for
this
manifestation
of
your
kindness
vanity
does
not
lead
me
so
far
to
misconceive
your
purpose
as
to
appropriate
the
demonstration
to
myself
but
it
is
not
the
less
gratifying
to
me
to
be
made
the
medium
through
which
maine
tenders
an
expression
of
regard
to
her
sister
mississippi
it
is
moreover
with
feelings
of
profound
gratification
that
i
witness
this
indication
of
that
national
sentiment
and
fraternity
which
made
us
and
which
alone
can
keep
us
one
people
at
a
period
but
as
yesterday
when
compared
with
the
life
of
nations
these
states
were
separate
and
in
some
respects
opposing
colonies
their
only
relation
to
each
other
was
that
of
a
common
allegiance
to
the
government
of
great
britain
so
separate
indeed
almost
hostile
was
their
attitude
that
when
general
stark
of
bennington
memory
was
captured
by
savages
on
the
of
the
kennebec
he
was
subsequently
taken
by
them
to
albany
where
they
went
to
sell
furs
and
again
led
away
a
captive
without
interference
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
neighboring
colony
to
demand
or
obtain
his
release
united
as
we
now
are
were
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
as
an
act
of
hostility
to
our
country
imprisoned
or
slain
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
whether
on
land
or
sea
the
people
of
each
and
every
state
of
the
union
with
one
heart
and
with
one
voice
would
demand
redress
and
woe
be
to
him
against
whom
a
brother
blood
cried
to
as
from
the
ground
such
is
the
fruit
of
the
wisdom
and
the
justice
with
which
our
fathers
bound
contending
colonies
into
confederation
and
blended
different
habits
and
rival
interests
into
an
harmonious
whole
so
that
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
entered
on
the
trial
of
the
revolution
and
step
with
step
trod
its
thorny
paths
until
they
reached
the
height
of
national
independence
and
founded
the
constitutional
representative
liberty
which
is
our
birthright
by
such
men
thus
trained
and
ennobled
our
constitution
was
framed
it
stands
a
monument
of
principle
of
forecast
and
above
all
of
that
liberality
which
made
each
willing
to
sacrifice
local
interest
individual
prejudice
or
temporary
good
to
the
general
welfare
and
the
perpetuity
of
the
republican
institutions
which
they
had
passed
through
fire
and
blood
to
secure
the
grants
were
as
broad
as
were
necessary
for
the
functions
of
the
general
agent
and
the
mutual
concessions
were
twice
blessed
blessing
him
who
gave
and
him
who
received
whatever
was
necessary
for
domestic
government
requisite
in
the
social
organization
of
each
community
was
retained
by
the
states
and
the
people
thereof
and
these
it
was
made
the
duty
of
all
to
defend
and
maintain
such
in
very
general
terms
is
the
rich
political
legacy
our
fathers
bequeathed
to
us
shall
we
preserve
and
transmit
it
to
posterity
yes
yes
the
heart
responds
and
the
judgment
answers
the
task
is
easily
performed
it
but
requires
that
each
should
attend
to
that
which
most
concerns
him
and
on
which
alone
he
has
rightful
power
to
decide
and
to
act
that
each
should
adhere
to
the
terms
of
a
written
compact
and
that
all
should
coöperate
for
that
which
interest
duty
and
honor
demand
for
the
general
affairs
of
our
country
both
foreign
and
domestic
we
have
a
national
executive
and
a
national
legislature
representatives
and
senators
are
chosen
by
districts
and
by
states
but
their
acts
affect
the
whole
country
and
their
obligations
are
to
the
whole
people
he
who
holding
either
seat
would
confine
his
investigations
to
the
mere
interests
of
his
immediate
constituents
would
be
derelict
to
his
plain
duty
and
he
who
would
legislate
in
hostility
to
any
section
would
be
morally
unfit
for
the
station
and
surely
an
unsafe
depositary
if
not
a
treacherous
guardian
of
the
inheritance
with
which
we
are
blessed
no
one
more
than
myself
recognizes
the
binding
force
of
the
allegiance
which
the
citizen
owes
to
the
state
of
his
citizenship
but
that
state
being
a
party
to
our
compact
a
member
of
the
union
fealty
to
the
federal
constitution
is
not
in
opposition
to
but
flows
from
the
allegiance
due
to
one
of
the
united
states
washington
was
not
less
a
virginian
when
he
commanded
at
boston
nor
did
gates
or
greene
weaken
the
bonds
which
bound
them
to
their
several
states
by
their
campaigns
in
the
south
in
proportion
as
a
citizen
loves
his
own
state
will
he
strive
to
honor
her
by
preserving
her
name
and
her
fame
free
from
the
tarnish
of
having
failed
to
observe
her
obligations
and
to
fulfill
her
duties
to
her
sister
states
each
page
of
our
history
is
illustrated
by
the
names
and
deeds
of
those
who
have
well
understood
and
discharged
the
obligation
have
we
so
degenerated
that
we
can
no
longer
emulate
their
virtues
have
the
purposes
for
which
our
union
was
formed
lost
their
value
has
patriotism
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
and
is
narrow
sectionalism
no
longer
to
be
counted
a
crime
shall
the
north
not
rejoice
that
the
progress
of
agriculture
in
the
south
has
given
to
her
great
staple
the
controlling
influence
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
and
put
manufacturing
nations
under
bond
to
keep
the
peace
with
the
united
states
shall
the
south
not
exult
in
the
fact
that
the
industry
and
persevering
intelligence
of
the
north
have
placed
her
mechanical
skill
in
the
front
ranks
of
the
civilized
world
that
our
whose
haughty
minister
some
years
ago
declared
that
not
a
hobnail
should
be
made
in
the
colonies
which
are
now
the
united
states
was
brought
some
four
years
ago
to
recognize
our
preëminence
by
sending
a
commission
to
examine
our
workshops
and
our
machinery
to
perfect
their
own
manufacture
of
the
arms
requisite
for
their
defense
do
not
our
whole
people
interior
and
seaboard
north
south
east
and
west
alike
feel
proud
of
the
hardihood
the
enterprise
the
skill
and
the
courage
of
the
yankee
sailor
who
has
borne
our
flag
far
as
the
ocean
bears
its
foam
and
caused
the
name
and
character
of
the
united
states
to
be
known
and
respected
wherever
there
is
wealth
enough
to
woo
commerce
and
intelligence
to
honor
merit
so
long
as
we
preserve
and
appreciate
the
achievements
of
jefferson
and
adams
of
franklin
and
madison
of
hamilton
of
hancock
and
of
rutledge
men
who
labored
for
the
whole
country
and
lived
for
mankind
we
can
not
sink
to
the
petty
strife
which
would
sap
the
foundations
and
destroy
the
political
fabric
our
fathers
erected
and
bequeathed
as
an
inheritance
to
our
posterity
for
ever
since
the
formation
of
the
constitution
a
vast
extension
of
territory
and
the
varied
relations
arising
therefrom
have
presented
problems
which
could
not
have
been
foreseen
it
is
just
cause
for
admiration
even
wonder
that
the
provisions
of
the
fundamental
law
should
have
been
so
fully
adequate
to
all
the
wants
of
a
government
new
in
its
organization
and
new
in
many
of
the
principles
on
which
it
was
founded
whatever
fears
may
have
once
existed
as
to
the
consequences
of
territorial
expansion
must
give
way
before
the
evidence
which
the
past
affords
the
general
government
strictly
confined
to
its
delegated
functions
and
the
state
left
in
the
undisturbed
exercise
of
all
else
we
have
a
theory
and
practice
which
fit
our
government
for
immeasurable
domain
and
might
under
a
millennium
of
nations
embrace
mankind
from
the
slope
of
the
atlantic
our
population
with
ceaseless
tide
has
poured
into
the
wide
and
fertile
valley
of
the
mississippi
with
eddying
whirl
has
passed
to
the
coast
of
the
pacific
from
the
west
and
the
east
the
tides
are
rushing
toward
each
other
and
the
mind
is
carried
to
the
day
when
all
the
cultivable
land
will
be
inhabited
and
the
american
people
will
sigh
for
more
wilderness
to
conquer
but
there
is
here
a
problem
presented
for
our
solution
were
it
purely
physical
your
past
triumphs
would
leave
but
little
doubt
of
your
capacity
to
solve
it
a
community
which
when
less
than
twenty
thousand
conceived
the
grand
project
of
crossing
the
white
mountains
and
unaided
save
by
the
stimulus
which
jeers
and
prophecies
of
failure
gave
successfully
executed
the
herculean
work
might
well
be
impatient
if
it
were
suggested
that
a
physical
problem
was
before
us
too
difficult
for
mastery
the
history
of
man
teaches
that
high
mountains
and
wide
deserts
have
resisted
the
permanent
extension
of
empire
and
have
formed
the
immutable
boundaries
of
states
from
time
to
time
under
some
able
leader
have
the
hordes
of
the
upper
plains
of
asia
swept
over
the
adjacent
country
and
rolled
their
conquering
columns
over
southern
europe
yet
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
generations
the
physical
law
to
which
i
have
referred
has
asserted
its
supremacy
and
the
boundaries
of
those
states
differ
little
now
from
those
which
were
obtained
three
thousand
years
ago
rome
flew
her
conquering
eagles
over
the
then
known
world
and
has
now
subsided
into
the
little
territory
on
which
the
great
city
was
originally
built
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
have
been
unable
to
restrain
imperial
france
but
her
expansion
was
a
feverish
action
her
advance
and
her
retreat
were
tracked
with
blood
and
those
are
the
reëstablished
limits
of
her
empire
shall
the
rocky
mountains
prove
a
dividing
barrier
to
us
were
ours
a
central
consolidated
government
instead
of
a
union
of
sovereign
states
our
fate
might
be
learned
from
the
history
of
other
nations
thanks
to
the
wisdom
and
independent
spirit
of
our
forefathers
this
is
not
the
case
each
state
having
sole
charge
of
its
local
interests
and
domestic
affairs
the
problem
which
to
others
has
been
insoluble
to
us
is
made
easy
rapid
safe
and
easy
communication
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
will
give
cointelligence
unity
of
interest
and
coöperation
among
all
parts
of
our
republic
the
network
of
railroads
which
bind
the
north
and
the
south
the
slope
of
the
atlantic
and
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
together
testifies
that
our
people
have
the
power
to
perform
in
that
regard
whatever
it
is
their
will
to
achieve
we
require
a
railroad
to
the
states
of
the
pacific
for
present
uses
the
time
no
doubt
will
come
when
we
shall
have
need
of
two
or
three
it
may
be
more
because
of
the
desert
character
of
the
interior
country
the
work
will
be
difficult
and
expensive
it
will
require
the
efforts
of
a
united
people
the
bickerings
of
little
politicians
the
jealousies
of
sections
must
give
way
to
dignity
of
purpose
and
zeal
for
the
common
good
if
the
object
be
obstructed
by
contention
and
division
as
to
whether
the
route
shall
be
northern
southern
or
central
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall
and
it
requires
little
skill
to
see
that
failure
is
the
interpretation
of
the
inscription
you
are
practical
people
and
may
ask
how
is
that
contest
to
be
avoided
by
taking
the
question
out
of
the
hands
of
politicians
altogether
let
the
government
give
such
aid
as
it
is
proper
for
it
to
render
to
the
company
which
shall
propose
the
most
feasible
plan
then
leave
to
capitalists
with
judgments
sharpened
by
interest
the
selection
of
the
route
and
the
difficulties
will
diminish
as
did
those
which
you
overcame
when
you
connected
your
harbor
with
the
canadian
provinces
it
would
be
to
trespass
on
your
kindness
and
to
violate
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
were
i
to
detain
the
vast
concourse
which
stands
before
me
by
entering
on
the
discussion
of
controverted
topics
or
by
further
indulging
in
the
expression
of
such
reflections
as
circumstances
suggest
i
came
to
your
city
in
quest
of
health
and
repose
from
the
moment
i
entered
it
you
have
showered
upon
me
kindness
and
hospitality
though
my
experience
has
taught
me
to
anticipate
good
rather
than
evil
from
my
it
had
not
prepared
me
to
expect
such
unremitting
attentions
as
have
here
been
bestowed
i
have
been
jocularly
asked
in
relation
to
my
coming
here
whether
i
had
secured
a
guarantee
for
my
safety
and
lo
i
have
found
it
i
stand
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
my
but
my
friends
i
came
neither
distrusting
nor
apprehensive
in
the
autumn
of
davis
visited
boston
and
was
invited
to
address
a
public
meeting
at
faneuil
hall
he
was
introduced
by
the
hon
caleb
cushing
with
whom
he
had
been
four
years
associated
in
the
cabinet
of
president
pierce
cushing
speech
on
account
of
its
great
merit
is
inserted
here
except
some
complimentary
portions
of
it
president
fellow
citizens
i
present
myself
before
you
at
the
instance
of
your
chairman
not
so
much
in
order
to
occupy
your
time
with
observations
of
my
own
as
to
prepare
you
for
that
higher
gratification
which
you
are
to
receive
from
the
remarks
of
the
eminent
man
here
present
to
address
you
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
will
briefly
and
only
suggest
to
you
such
reflections
as
are
appropriate
to
that
duty
we
are
assembled
here
my
friends
at
the
call
of
the
democratic
ward
and
county
committee
of
suffolk
for
the
purpose
of
ratifying
the
nominations
made
at
the
late
democratic
state
convention
the
nomination
of
our
distinguished
and
honored
hon
erasmus
beach
who
has
already
addressed
to
you
the
words
of
wisdom
and
of
patriotism
as
also
the
nomination
of
others
of
our
whom
if
we
may
we
ought
whom
the
welfare
and
the
honor
of
our
commonwealth
demand
of
us
to
place
in
power
in
the
stead
of
the
existing
authorities
of
the
commonwealth
i
would
to
god
it
were
in
our
power
to
say
with
confidence
that
shall
be
done
it
can
be
done
we
do
say
that
it
shall
not
depend
upon
us
that
it
shall
not
be
done
we
do
say
that
in
so
far
as
depends
upon
us
it
shall
be
done
and
whatsoever
devoted
love
of
our
country
and
our
commonwealth
whatsoever
of
our
noble
and
holy
principles
whatsoever
desire
to
vindicate
our
commonwealth
from
the
stain
that
has
so
long
rested
upon
the
name
may
prompt
us
to
do
that
we
will
do
leaving
the
result
to
the
good
providence
of
god
i
say
we
are
invited
here
by
the
ward
and
county
committee
to
ratify
these
nominations
and
we
do
ratify
them
with
our
whole
heart
and
we
pledge
our
most
earnest
efforts
at
the
polls
to
give
success
to
these
nominations
that
call
is
comprehensive
it
is
addressed
not
only
to
democrats
but
to
all
national
men
and
so
it
should
be
we
know
full
well
that
there
are
multitudes
of
men
in
this
commonwealth
who
oppose
the
democratic
party
but
who
are
yet
impelled
toward
us
by
sympathy
for
the
principles
we
profess
and
by
the
repulsion
they
have
toward
the
opinions
and
purposes
of
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party
they
sympathize
with
our
principles
and
we
invite
them
to
coöperate
with
us
in
the
maintenance
of
the
principles
of
the
constitution
and
in
the
vindication
of
the
commonwealth
all
national
men
whatsoever
may
have
been
their
past
party
affinities
but
while
we
do
so
we
declare
that
it
is
our
belief
that
the
democratic
party
is
now
recognized
as
that
only
existing
national
party
in
the
united
states
the
only
constitutional
party
the
only
party
which
by
its
present
principles
is
competent
to
govern
these
united
states
whose
principles
are
based
upon
the
constitution
the
only
party
with
a
platform
coextensive
with
this
great
union
this
is
the
great
democratic
party
i
have
heard
again
and
again
remonstrances
have
been
addressed
to
me
more
than
once
because
of
the
condemnation
which
democratic
speakers
so
continually
utter
about
the
unnationality
as
well
as
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
republican
party
let
us
reflect
a
moment
let
us
recall
to
mind
that
the
honor
of
the
existing
organization
of
this
federal
administration
was
by
the
votes
of
the
people
of
these
united
states
sustained
when
james
buchanan
was
nominated
for
the
presidency
and
that
he
is
a
worthy
representative
of
the
democratic
party
let
us
reflect
also
that
john
fremont
was
nominated
as
the
candidate
of
the
republican
party
i
pray
you
gentlemen
to
reflect
upon
the
different
methods
by
which
these
nominations
were
presented
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
on
the
one
hand
there
assembled
at
the
democratic
convention
at
cincinnati
the
delegates
of
every
one
of
the
states
in
the
union
that
convention
was
national
in
its
constitution
national
in
its
character
national
in
its
purpose
and
cordially
presented
to
the
suffrages
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
national
candidate
a
candidate
of
the
whole
united
states
and
that
candidate
was
elected
not
by
the
votes
of
one
section
of
the
union
alone
or
another
section
of
the
union
alone
but
by
the
concurrent
votes
of
the
south
and
the
north
how
was
it
on
the
other
side
on
the
other
side
there
assembled
a
convention
which
by
the
very
tenor
of
its
call
was
confined
to
sixteen
of
the
states
of
the
union
which
by
the
very
tenor
of
its
call
excluded
from
its
councils
fifteen
of
the
states
of
the
union
a
convention
in
which
appeared
the
representatives
of
only
sixteen
of
the
states
of
the
union
nay
i
mistake
as
to
the
remaining
fifteen
states
of
the
union
in
their
name
pretendedly
in
their
name
and
their
behalf
there
appeared
one
man
one
man
only
and
he
a
delegate
by
pretension
from
the
state
of
maryland
that
was
the
convention
which
presented
john
fremont
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
say
that
was
a
sectional
convention
a
sectional
nomination
a
sectional
party
and
no
reasoning
no
remonstrances
no
protestations
can
discharge
the
republican
party
from
the
ineffaceable
stigma
of
that
sectional
convention
that
sectional
nomination
and
that
sectional
candidate
for
the
suffrages
of
the
united
states
that
party
itself
has
placed
upon
its
back
that
shirt
of
nessus
which
clings
to
it
and
stings
it
to
death
i
repeat
then
and
i
say
it
in
confidence
and
vindication
in
so
far
as
regards
my
own
belief
i
say
it
in
all
good
spirit
toward
multitudes
of
men
in
this
commonwealth
of
the
whig
and
american
parties
in
their
heretofore
organization
i
say
it
to
multitudes
of
men
who
have
been
betrayed
by
the
passions
of
the
hour
into
joining
the
sectional
combinations
of
the
republican
party
i
say
that
in
the
democratic
party
and
in
that
alone
is
the
tower
of
strength
for
the
liberties
the
position
and
the
honor
of
the
united
states
but
why
need
i
indulge
in
these
reflections
in
proof
of
my
proposition
gentlemen
we
have
here
this
evening
the
living
proof
the
visible
tangible
audible
incontestable
immortal
proof
that
the
position
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
existing
organization
of
parties
is
the
national
constitutional
party
of
the
united
states
gentlemen
i
ask
you
to
challenge
your
memories
and
look
upon
the
history
of
the
past
four
years
of
the
united
states
and
can
you
point
me
to
a
republican
assembly
here
in
the
city
of
boston
or
anywhere
else
can
you
point
me
in
the
last
four
years
of
our
history
to
any
occasion
on
which
faneuil
hall
has
been
crowded
to
its
utmost
capability
with
a
republican
assembly
in
which
appeared
any
one
of
those
preëminent
statesmen
of
the
southern
states
to
honor
not
merely
their
states
but
these
united
states
when
sir
did
that
ever
happen
when
sir
was
that
a
possible
fact
morally
speaking
that
any
eminent
southern
statesman
appeared
in
a
republican
assembly
in
any
one
of
the
states
of
this
union
there
never
was
a
republican
assembly
an
assembly
of
the
republican
party
in
fifteen
of
these
states
and
i
again
ask
when
in
the
remaining
sixteen
states
was
there
ever
convened
an
assembly
of
the
republican
party
which
by
reason
of
bigotry
proscriptive
bigotry
of
unnational
hatred
of
the
south
and
of
determined
insult
of
all
southern
statesmen
did
not
render
it
an
impossible
fact
that
any
southern
statesman
should
thus
make
his
appearance
as
a
member
in
such
republican
convention
you
know
it
is
so
gentlemen
and
yet
have
we
not
a
common
country
did
those
thirteen
colonies
which
commencing
with
that
combat
at
concord
and
following
it
with
that
battle
at
bunker
hill
and
pursuing
it
in
every
battlefield
of
this
continent
did
those
thirteen
colonies
form
one
country
or
thirteen
countries
nay
did
they
form
two
countries
or
one
country
i
would
imagine
when
i
listen
to
a
republican
speech
here
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
when
i
read
a
republican
address
in
massachusetts
i
would
imagine
fifteen
states
of
this
union
our
or
our
of
the
revolution
i
would
imagine
not
that
they
are
our
countrymen
endeared
to
us
by
ties
of
consanguinity
but
that
they
are
from
some
foreign
country
that
they
belong
to
some
french
or
british
or
mexican
enemies
there
never
was
a
day
in
which
the
forces
of
war
were
marshaled
against
the
most
flagrant
abuses
toward
these
united
states
there
never
was
a
war
in
which
these
united
states
have
been
engaged
never
even
in
the
of
the
revolution
never
in
our
war
for
maritime
independence
never
in
our
war
with
france
and
mexico
never
was
there
a
time
when
any
party
in
these
united
states
expressed
avowed
proclaimed
ostentatiously
proclaimed
more
intense
hostility
to
the
british
french
mexican
enemy
than
i
have
heard
uttered
or
proclaimed
concerning
our
brothers
in
the
fifteen
states
of
this
union
it
is
the
glory
of
the
democratic
party
that
we
can
assume
the
burden
of
our
nationality
for
the
union
that
we
can
make
all
due
sacrifices
in
order
to
show
our
reprobation
of
sectionalism
that
we
of
the
north
can
sacrifice
to
the
south
from
dear
attachment
to
our
of
the
south
and
they
in
the
south
in
like
manner
meet
with
us
upon
that
ground
in
order
to
show
their
love
for
the
federal
union
and
at
the
risk
of
encountering
local
prejudices
in
the
democratic
party
alone
as
parties
are
now
organized
is
this
catholic
generous
universal
spirit
to
be
found
i
say
then
the
democratic
party
has
such
a
character
of
constitutionality
and
of
nationality
and
now
gentlemen
i
have
allowed
myself
unthinkingly
to
be
carried
beyond
my
original
purpose
i
return
to
it
to
remind
you
that
here
among
us
is
a
citizen
of
one
of
the
southern
states
eloquent
among
the
most
eloquent
in
debate
wise
among
the
wisest
in
council
and
brave
among
the
bravest
in
the
a
citizen
of
a
southern
state
who
knows
that
he
can
associate
with
you
the
representatives
of
the
democracy
and
the
nationality
of
massachusetts
that
he
can
associate
with
you
on
equal
footing
with
the
and
common
members
of
these
united
states
my
friends
there
are
those
here
present
and
in
fact
there
is
no
one
here
present
of
whom
it
can
not
be
said
that
in
memory
and
admiration
at
least
and
if
not
in
the
actual
fact
yet
in
proud
and
bounding
memory
they
have
been
able
to
tread
the
glorious
tracks
of
the
victorious
achievements
of
jefferson
davis
on
the
fields
of
monterey
and
buena
vista
and
all
have
heard
or
have
read
the
accents
of
eloquence
addressed
by
him
to
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
there
is
one
at
least
who
from
his
own
personal
observation
can
bear
witness
to
the
fact
of
the
surpassing
wisdom
of
jefferson
davis
in
the
administration
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
such
a
man
you
are
this
evening
to
hear
and
to
hear
as
a
beautiful
illustration
of
the
working
of
our
republican
institutions
of
these
united
states
of
the
republican
institutions
which
in
our
own
country
our
own
republic
as
in
the
old
republics
of
athens
and
of
rome
exhibit
the
same
combinations
of
the
highest
military
and
civic
qualities
in
the
same
person
it
must
naturally
be
so
for
in
a
republic
every
citizen
is
a
soldier
and
every
soldier
a
citizen
not
in
these
united
states
on
the
occurrence
of
foreign
war
is
that
spectacle
exhibited
which
we
have
so
recently
seen
in
our
of
the
administration
of
the
country
going
abroad
begging
and
stealing
soldiers
throughout
europe
and
america
no
and
while
i
ask
you
my
friends
to
ponder
this
fact
in
relation
to
that
disastrous
struggle
of
giants
which
so
recently
occurred
in
our
day
the
crimean
war
i
ask
you
whether
any
english
gentleman
any
member
of
the
british
house
of
commons
any
member
of
the
british
house
of
peers
abandoned
the
ease
of
home
abandoned
his
easy
hours
at
home
and
went
into
the
country
among
his
friends
tenants
and
volunteering
there
to
raise
troops
for
the
service
of
england
in
that
hour
of
her
peril
did
any
such
fact
occur
no
but
here
in
these
united
states
we
had
examples
and
illustrious
ones
of
the
fact
that
men
eminent
in
their
place
in
congress
abandoned
their
stations
and
their
honors
to
go
among
of
their
own
states
and
there
raise
troops
with
which
to
vindicate
the
honor
and
the
flag
of
their
country
of
such
men
was
jefferson
davis
there
is
now
living
one
military
man
of
prominent
distinction
in
the
public
eye
of
england
and
the
united
states
i
mean
sir
colin
campbell
now
lord
clyde
of
clydesdale
he
deserves
the
distinction
he
enjoys
for
he
has
redeemed
the
british
flag
on
the
ensanguined
burning
plains
of
india
he
has
restored
the
glory
of
the
british
name
in
asia
i
honor
him
scotland
england
wales
and
ireland
are
open
for
their
counties
as
well
as
their
countries
and
their
poets
orators
and
statesmen
and
their
generals
belong
to
our
history
as
well
as
theirs
i
will
never
disavow
henry
v
on
the
plains
of
agincourt
never
oliver
cromwell
on
the
fields
of
marston
moor
and
naseby
never
sarsfield
on
the
banks
of
the
boyne
the
glories
and
honors
of
sir
colin
campbell
are
the
glories
of
the
british
race
and
the
races
of
great
britain
and
ireland
from
whom
we
are
descended
but
what
gained
sir
colin
campbell
the
opportunity
to
achieve
those
glorious
results
in
india
remember
that
and
let
us
see
what
it
was
on
one
of
those
bloody
battles
fought
by
the
british
before
the
fortress
of
sebastopol
in
the
midst
of
the
perils
the
most
perilous
of
all
the
england
ever
encountered
in
europe
in
one
of
the
bloody
charges
of
the
russian
cavalry
there
was
an
officer
a
man
who
felt
and
who
possessed
sufficient
confidence
in
the
troops
he
commanded
and
in
the
authority
of
his
own
voice
and
example
received
that
charge
not
in
the
ordinary
commonplace
and
accustomed
manner
by
forming
his
troops
into
a
hollow
square
and
thus
arresting
the
charge
but
by
forming
into
two
diverging
lines
and
thus
receiving
upon
the
rifles
of
his
highlandmen
the
charge
of
the
russian
cavalry
and
repelling
it
how
all
england
rang
with
the
glory
of
that
achievement
how
the
general
voice
of
england
placed
upon
the
brows
of
sir
colin
campbell
the
laurels
of
the
future
mastership
of
victory
for
the
arms
of
england
and
well
they
might
do
so
but
who
originated
that
movement
who
set
the
example
of
that
gallant
operation
who
but
colonel
jefferson
davis
of
the
first
mississippi
regiment
on
the
field
of
buena
vista
he
was
justly
entitled
to
the
applause
of
the
restorer
of
victory
to
the
arms
of
the
union
gentlemen
in
our
country
in
this
day
such
a
man
such
a
master
of
the
art
of
war
so
daring
in
the
field
such
a
man
may
not
only
aspire
to
the
highest
places
in
the
executive
government
of
the
union
but
such
a
man
may
acquire
what
nowhere
else
since
the
days
of
cimon
and
miltiades
of
the
cincinnati
and
the
cornelii
of
athens
and
of
rome
has
been
done
by
the
human
race
the
combination
of
eminent
powers
of
intellectual
cultivation
and
of
eloquence
with
the
practical
qualities
of
a
statesman
and
general
but
gentlemen
i
am
again
betrayed
beyond
my
purpose
sir
addressing
general
davis
we
welcome
you
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
you
may
not
find
here
the
ardent
skies
of
your
own
sunny
south
but
you
will
find
as
ardent
hearts
as
warm
and
generous
hands
to
welcome
you
to
our
commonwealth
we
welcome
you
to
the
city
of
boston
and
you
have
already
experienced
how
how
generous
how
free
from
all
possible
taint
of
sectional
thought
are
the
hospitality
and
cordiality
of
the
city
of
boston
we
welcome
you
to
faneuil
hall
many
an
eloquent
voice
has
in
all
times
resounded
from
the
walls
of
faneuil
hall
it
is
said
that
no
voice
is
uttered
by
man
in
this
air
we
breathe
but
enters
into
that
air
it
continues
there
immortal
as
the
portion
of
the
universe
into
which
it
has
passed
if
it
be
so
how
instinct
is
faneuil
hall
with
the
voice
of
the
great
good
and
glorious
of
past
generations
and
of
our
own
whose
voices
have
echoed
through
its
walls
whose
eloquent
words
have
thrilled
the
hearts
of
hearers
as
if
a
pointed
sword
were
passing
them
through
and
through
here
adams
aroused
his
countrymen
in
the
war
of
independence
and
webster
invoked
them
almost
with
the
dying
breath
of
his
body
invoked
with
that
voice
of
majesty
and
power
which
he
alone
possessed
invoked
them
to
a
union
between
the
north
and
south
ay
sir
and
who
if
he
were
here
present
who
from
those
blest
abodes
on
high
from
which
he
looks
down
upon
us
would
congratulate
us
for
this
scene
first
and
above
all
because
his
large
heart
would
have
appreciated
the
spectacle
of
a
statesman
eminent
among
the
most
eminent
of
the
southern
states
here
addressing
an
assembly
of
the
people
in
the
city
of
boston
because
in
the
second
place
he
would
have
remembered
that
though
divided
from
you
by
party
relations
in
one
of
the
critical
hours
of
his
fame
and
his
honor
your
voice
was
not
wanting
for
his
vindication
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
sir
again
i
say
we
welcome
you
to
faneuil
hall
and
now
my
i
will
withdraw
myself
and
present
to
you
the
hon
jefferson
davis
address
of
jefferson
davis
at
faneuil
hall
boston
october
countrymen
brethren
democrats
most
happy
am
i
to
meet
you
and
to
have
received
here
renewed
assurance
of
that
which
i
have
so
long
believed
that
the
pulsation
of
the
democratic
heart
is
the
same
in
every
parallel
of
latitude
on
every
meridian
of
longitude
throughout
the
united
states
it
required
not
this
to
confirm
me
in
a
belief
i
have
so
long
and
so
happily
enjoyed
your
own
great
statesman
the
hon
caleb
cushing
who
has
introduced
me
to
this
assembly
has
been
too
long
associated
with
me
too
nearly
connected
we
have
labored
too
many
hours
until
one
day
ran
into
another
in
the
cause
of
our
country
for
me
to
fail
to
understand
that
a
massachusetts
democrat
has
a
heart
as
wide
as
the
union
and
that
its
pulsations
always
beat
for
the
liberty
and
happiness
of
his
country
neither
could
i
be
unaware
that
such
was
the
sentiment
of
the
democracy
of
new
england
for
it
was
my
fortune
lately
to
serve
under
a
president
drawn
from
the
neighboring
state
of
new
hampshire
and
i
know
that
he
spoke
the
language
of
his
heart
for
i
learned
it
in
four
years
of
intimate
relations
with
him
when
he
said
he
knew
no
north
no
south
no
east
no
west
but
sacred
maintenance
of
the
common
bond
and
true
devotion
to
the
common
brotherhood
never
sir
in
the
past
history
of
our
country
never
i
add
in
its
future
destiny
however
bright
it
may
be
did
or
will
a
man
of
higher
and
purer
patriotism
a
man
more
devoted
to
the
common
weal
of
his
country
hold
the
helm
of
our
great
ship
of
state
than
franklin
pierce
i
have
heard
the
resolutions
read
and
approved
by
this
meeting
i
have
heard
the
address
of
your
candidate
for
governor
and
these
added
to
the
address
of
my
old
and
intimate
friend
general
cushing
bear
to
me
fresh
testimony
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
carry
away
with
me
that
the
democracy
in
the
language
of
your
own
glorious
webster
still
lives
lives
not
as
his
great
spirit
did
when
it
hung
life
and
death
like
a
star
upon
the
horizon
verge
but
lives
like
the
germ
that
is
shooting
upward
like
the
sapling
that
is
growing
to
a
mighty
tree
and
i
trust
it
may
redeem
massachusetts
to
her
glorious
place
in
the
union
when
she
led
the
van
of
the
defenders
of
state
rights
when
i
see
faneuil
hall
thus
thronged
it
reminds
me
of
another
meeting
when
it
was
found
too
small
to
contain
the
assembly
that
met
here
on
the
call
of
the
people
to
know
what
should
be
done
in
relation
to
the
and
when
faneuil
hall
being
too
small
they
went
to
the
old
south
church
which
still
stands
a
monument
of
your
early
day
i
hope
the
time
will
soon
come
when
many
democratic
meetings
in
boston
will
be
too
large
for
faneuil
hall
i
am
welcomed
to
this
hall
so
venerable
for
all
the
associations
of
our
early
history
to
this
hall
of
which
you
are
so
justly
proud
and
the
memories
of
which
are
part
of
the
inheritance
of
every
american
citizen
and
i
felt
as
i
looked
upon
it
and
remembered
how
many
voices
of
patriotic
fervor
have
filled
it
how
here
the
first
movement
originated
from
which
the
revolution
sprang
how
here
began
the
system
of
town
meetings
and
free
discussion
that
though
my
theme
was
more
humble
than
theirs
as
befitted
my
humbler
powers
i
had
enough
to
warn
me
that
i
was
assuming
much
to
speak
in
this
sacred
chamber
but
when
i
heard
your
distinguished
orator
say
that
words
uttered
here
could
never
die
that
they
lived
and
became
a
part
of
the
circumambient
air
i
feel
a
hesitation
which
increases
upon
me
with
the
remembrance
of
his
expressions
but
if
those
voices
which
breathed
the
first
impulse
into
the
colonies
now
the
united
states
to
proclaim
independence
and
to
unite
for
resistance
against
the
power
of
the
if
those
voices
live
here
still
how
must
they
fare
who
come
here
to
preach
treason
to
the
constitution
and
to
assail
the
union
of
these
states
it
would
seem
that
their
criminal
hearts
would
fear
that
those
voices
so
long
slumbering
would
break
silence
that
those
forms
which
hang
upon
these
walls
behind
me
might
come
forth
and
that
the
sabers
so
long
sheathed
would
leap
from
their
scabbards
to
drive
from
this
sacred
temple
those
who
desecrate
it
as
did
the
who
sold
doves
in
the
temple
of
the
living
god
here
you
have
to
remind
you
and
to
remind
all
who
enter
this
hall
the
portraits
of
those
men
who
are
dear
to
every
lover
of
liberty
and
part
and
parcel
of
the
memory
of
every
american
citizen
and
highest
among
them
all
i
see
you
have
placed
samuel
adams
and
john
hancock
you
have
placed
them
the
highest
and
properly
for
they
were
two
the
only
two
excepted
from
the
proclamation
of
mercy
when
governor
gage
issued
his
anathema
against
them
and
against
their
these
men
thus
excepted
from
the
saving
grace
of
the
crown
now
occupy
the
highest
places
in
faneuil
hall
and
thus
seem
to
be
the
highest
in
the
reverence
of
the
people
of
boston
this
is
one
of
the
instances
in
which
we
find
tradition
so
much
more
reliable
than
history
for
tradition
has
borne
the
name
of
samuel
adams
to
the
remotest
of
the
colonies
and
the
new
states
formed
out
of
what
was
territory
of
the
old
colonies
and
there
it
is
a
name
as
sacred
among
us
as
it
is
among
you
we
all
remember
how
early
he
saw
the
necessity
of
community
independence
how
through
the
dim
mists
of
the
future
and
in
advance
of
his
day
he
looked
forward
to
the
proclamation
of
the
independence
of
massachusetts
how
he
steadily
strove
through
good
report
and
evil
report
with
a
great
unwavering
heart
whether
in
the
midst
of
his
cheered
by
their
voices
or
communing
with
his
own
heart
when
driven
from
his
home
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
his
first
last
hope
the
community
independence
of
massachusetts
always
a
commanding
figure
we
see
him
at
a
later
period
the
leader
in
the
correspondence
which
waked
the
feelings
of
the
other
colonies
to
united
fraternal
association
the
people
of
massachusetts
with
the
people
of
the
other
colonies
there
we
see
his
letters
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
rice
of
south
carolina
and
the
money
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
all
these
poured
in
to
relieve
boston
of
the
sufferings
inflicted
upon
her
when
the
port
was
closed
by
the
despotism
of
the
british
crown
we
see
the
beginning
of
that
which
insured
the
coöperation
of
the
colonies
throughout
the
desperate
struggle
of
the
revolution
and
we
there
see
that
which
if
the
present
generation
be
true
to
the
memory
of
their
sires
to
the
memory
of
the
noble
men
from
whom
they
descended
will
perpetuate
for
them
that
spirit
of
fraternity
in
which
the
union
began
but
it
is
not
here
alone
nor
in
reminiscences
connected
with
the
objects
which
present
themselves
within
this
hall
that
the
people
of
boston
have
much
to
excite
their
patriotism
and
carry
them
back
to
the
great
principles
of
the
revolutionary
struggle
where
will
you
go
and
not
meet
some
monument
to
inspire
such
sentiments
go
to
lexington
and
concord
where
sixty
brave
countrymen
came
with
their
to
oppose
six
hundred
veterans
where
they
forced
those
veterans
back
pursuing
them
on
the
road
fighting
from
every
barn
and
bush
and
stock
and
stone
till
they
drove
them
retreating
to
the
ships
from
which
they
went
forth
and
there
stand
those
monuments
of
your
early
patriotism
breed
and
bunker
hills
whose
soil
drank
the
of
men
who
lived
for
their
country
and
died
for
mankind
can
it
be
that
any
of
you
should
tread
that
soil
and
forget
the
great
purposes
for
which
those
men
died
while
on
the
other
side
rise
the
heights
of
dorchester
where
once
stood
the
encampment
of
the
virginian
the
man
who
came
here
and
did
not
ask
is
this
a
town
of
virginia
but
is
this
a
town
of
my
brethren
the
steady
courage
and
cautious
wisdom
of
washington
availed
to
drive
the
british
troops
out
from
the
city
which
they
had
so
confidently
held
here
too
you
find
where
once
the
old
liberty
tree
connected
with
so
many
of
your
memories
grew
you
ask
your
legend
and
learn
that
it
was
cut
down
for
firewood
by
british
soldiers
as
some
of
your
were
destroyed
they
burned
the
old
tree
and
it
warmed
the
soldiers
long
enough
to
leave
town
and
had
they
burned
it
a
little
longer
its
light
would
have
shown
washington
and
his
followers
where
their
enemies
were
but
they
are
gone
and
never
again
shall
a
hostile
foot
set
its
imprint
upon
your
soil
your
harbor
is
being
fortified
to
prevent
an
unexpected
attack
on
your
city
by
a
hostile
fleet
but
woe
to
the
enemy
whose
fleet
shall
bear
him
to
your
shores
to
set
his
footprint
upon
your
soil
he
goes
to
a
prison
or
to
a
grave
american
fortifications
are
not
built
from
any
fear
of
invasion
they
are
intended
to
guard
points
where
marine
attacks
can
be
made
and
for
the
rest
the
hearts
of
americans
are
our
ramparts
but
my
friends
it
is
not
merely
in
these
associations
so
connected
with
the
honorable
pride
of
massachusetts
that
one
who
visits
boston
finds
much
for
gratification
hope
and
instruction
if
i
were
selecting
a
place
where
the
advocate
of
strict
construction
the
extreme
expounder
of
democratic
doctrine
should
go
for
his
texts
i
would
send
him
into
the
collections
of
your
historical
associations
instead
of
going
to
boston
as
a
place
where
only
consolidation
would
be
found
he
would
find
written
in
letters
of
living
light
that
sacred
creed
of
state
rights
which
has
been
miscalled
the
ultra
opinions
of
the
south
he
could
find
among
your
early
records
that
this
faneuil
hall
the
property
of
the
town
at
the
time
when
massachusetts
was
under
a
colonial
government
administered
by
a
man
appointed
by
the
british
crown
guarded
by
british
soldiers
was
refused
to
a
british
governor
in
which
to
hold
a
british
festival
because
he
was
going
to
bring
with
him
the
agents
for
collecting
and
naval
officers
sent
here
to
enforce
an
oppressive
tax
upon
your
commonwealth
such
was
the
proud
spirit
of
independence
manifested
even
in
your
colonial
history
such
is
the
great
on
which
may
be
erected
an
eternal
monument
of
state
rights
and
so
in
an
early
period
of
our
country
you
find
massachusetts
leading
the
movements
prominent
of
all
the
states
in
the
assertion
of
that
doctrine
which
has
been
recently
so
much
belied
having
achieved
your
independence
having
passed
through
the
confederation
you
assented
to
the
formation
of
our
present
constitutional
union
you
did
not
surrender
your
sovereignty
your
fathers
had
sacrificed
too
much
to
claim
as
a
reward
of
their
toil
merely
that
they
should
have
a
change
of
masters
and
a
change
of
masters
it
would
have
been
had
massachusetts
surrendered
her
state
sovereignty
to
the
central
government
and
consented
that
that
central
government
should
have
the
power
to
coerce
a
state
but
if
this
power
does
not
exist
if
this
sovereignty
has
not
been
surrendered
then
who
can
deny
the
words
of
soberness
and
truth
spoken
by
your
candidate
this
evening
when
he
has
pleaded
to
you
the
cause
of
state
independence
and
the
right
of
every
community
to
be
judge
of
its
own
domestic
affairs
this
is
all
we
have
ever
asked
we
of
the
south
i
mean
for
i
stand
before
you
as
one
of
those
who
have
always
been
called
the
ultra
men
of
the
south
and
i
speak
therefore
for
that
class
and
i
tell
you
that
your
candidate
for
governor
has
uttered
everything
which
we
have
claimed
as
a
principle
for
our
protection
and
i
have
found
the
same
condition
of
things
in
the
neighboring
state
of
maine
i
have
found
that
the
democrats
there
asserted
the
same
broad
constitutional
principle
for
which
we
have
been
contending
by
which
we
are
willing
to
live
for
which
we
are
willing
to
die
in
this
state
of
the
case
my
friends
why
is
the
country
agitated
the
old
controversies
have
passed
away
or
they
have
subsided
and
have
been
covered
up
by
one
dark
pall
of
somber
hue
which
increases
with
every
passing
year
why
is
it
then
i
say
that
you
are
thus
agitated
in
relation
to
the
domestic
affairs
of
other
communities
why
is
it
that
the
peace
of
the
country
is
disturbed
in
order
that
one
people
may
judge
of
what
another
people
may
do
is
there
any
political
power
to
authorize
such
interference
if
so
where
is
it
you
did
not
surrender
your
sovereignty
you
gave
to
the
federal
government
certain
functions
it
was
your
agent
created
for
specified
purposes
it
can
do
nothing
save
that
which
you
have
given
it
power
to
perform
where
is
the
grant
has
it
a
right
to
determine
what
shall
be
property
surely
not
that
belongs
to
every
community
to
decide
for
itself
you
judge
in
your
case
every
other
state
must
judge
in
its
case
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
destroy
property
do
you
pay
taxes
then
to
an
agent
that
he
may
destroy
your
property
do
you
support
him
for
that
purpose
it
is
an
absurdity
on
the
face
of
it
to
ask
the
question
is
to
answer
it
the
government
is
instituted
to
protect
not
to
destroy
property
and
in
abundance
of
caution
your
fathers
provided
that
the
federal
government
should
not
take
private
property
for
its
own
use
unless
by
making
due
compensation
therefor
it
is
prohibited
from
attempting
to
destroy
property
one
of
its
great
purposes
was
protection
to
the
states
whenever
that
power
is
made
a
source
of
danger
we
destroy
the
purpose
for
which
the
government
was
formed
why
then
have
you
agitators
with
pharisaical
pretension
it
is
sometimes
said
it
is
a
moral
obligation
to
agitate
and
i
suppose
they
are
going
through
a
sort
of
vicarious
repentance
for
other
men
sins
with
all
due
allowance
for
their
zeal
we
ask
how
do
they
decide
that
it
is
a
sin
by
what
standard
do
they
measure
it
not
the
constitution
the
constitution
recognizes
the
property
in
slaves
in
many
forms
and
imposes
obligations
in
connection
with
that
recognition
not
the
bible
that
justifies
it
not
the
good
of
society
for
if
they
go
where
it
exists
they
find
that
society
recognizes
it
as
good
what
then
is
their
standard
the
good
of
mankind
is
that
seen
in
the
diminished
resources
of
the
country
is
that
seen
in
the
diminished
comfort
of
the
world
or
is
not
the
reverse
exhibited
is
there
in
the
cause
of
christianity
a
motive
for
the
prohibition
of
the
system
which
is
the
only
agency
through
which
christianity
has
reached
that
inferior
race
the
only
means
by
which
they
have
been
civilized
and
elevated
or
is
their
piety
manifested
in
denunciation
of
their
brethren
who
are
deterred
from
answering
their
denunciation
only
by
the
contempt
which
they
feel
for
a
mere
brawler
who
intends
to
end
his
brawling
only
in
empty
words
what
my
friends
must
be
the
consequences
good
or
evil
they
have
been
evil
and
evil
they
must
be
only
to
the
end
not
one
particle
of
good
has
been
done
to
any
man
of
any
color
by
this
agitation
it
has
been
insidiously
working
the
purpose
of
sedition
for
the
destruction
of
that
union
on
which
our
hopes
of
future
greatness
depend
on
the
one
side
then
you
see
agitation
tending
slowly
and
steadily
to
that
separation
of
states
which
if
you
have
any
hope
connected
with
the
liberty
of
mankind
if
you
have
any
national
pride
connected
with
making
your
country
the
greatest
on
the
face
of
the
earth
if
you
have
any
sacred
regard
for
the
obligations
which
the
deeds
and
the
blood
of
your
fathers
entailed
upon
you
that
hope
should
prompt
you
to
reject
anything
that
would
tend
to
destroy
the
result
of
that
experiment
which
they
left
it
to
you
to
conclude
and
perpetuate
on
the
other
hand
if
each
community
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
our
government
should
regard
its
domestic
interests
as
a
part
of
the
common
whole
and
struggle
for
the
benefit
of
all
this
would
steadily
lead
us
to
fraternity
to
unity
to
coöperation
to
the
increase
of
our
happiness
and
the
extension
of
the
benefits
of
our
useful
example
over
mankind
the
flag
of
the
union
whose
stars
have
already
more
than
doubled
their
original
number
with
its
ample
folds
may
wave
the
recognized
flag
of
every
state
or
the
recognized
protector
of
every
state
upon
the
continent
of
america
in
connection
with
the
view
which
i
have
presented
of
the
early
idea
of
community
independence
i
will
add
the
very
striking
fact
that
one
of
the
colonies
about
the
time
they
had
resolved
to
unite
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
their
independence
addressed
the
colonial
congress
to
know
in
what
condition
it
would
be
in
the
interval
between
its
separation
from
the
government
of
great
britain
and
the
establishment
of
a
government
on
this
continent
the
answer
of
the
colonial
congress
was
exactly
what
might
have
been
expected
exactly
what
democracy
would
answer
to
such
an
inquiry
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
such
sentiment
had
continued
if
it
had
governed
in
every
state
if
representatives
had
been
chosen
upon
it
then
your
halls
of
federal
legislation
would
not
have
been
disturbed
about
the
question
of
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
different
states
the
peace
of
the
country
would
not
be
hazarded
by
the
arraignment
of
the
family
relations
of
people
over
whom
the
government
has
no
control
if
in
harmony
working
together
with
for
the
conservation
of
the
interests
of
the
country
if
protection
to
the
states
and
the
other
great
ends
for
which
the
government
was
established
had
been
the
aim
and
united
effort
of
all
what
effects
would
not
have
been
produced
as
our
government
increases
in
expansion
it
would
increase
in
its
beneficent
effect
upon
the
people
we
should
as
we
grow
in
power
and
prosperity
also
grow
in
fraternity
and
it
would
be
no
longer
a
wonder
to
see
a
man
coming
from
a
southern
state
to
address
a
democratic
audience
in
boston
but
i
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
massachusetts
stood
preëminently
forward
among
those
who
asserted
community
independence
and
this
reminds
me
of
another
incident
president
washington
visited
boston
when
john
hancock
was
governor
and
hancock
refused
to
call
upon
the
president
because
he
contended
that
any
man
who
came
within
the
limits
of
massachusetts
must
yield
rank
and
precedence
to
the
governor
of
the
state
he
eventually
only
surrendered
the
point
on
account
of
his
personal
regard
and
respect
for
the
character
of
george
washington
i
honor
him
for
this
and
value
it
as
one
of
the
early
testimonies
in
favor
of
state
rights
i
wish
all
our
governors
had
the
same
regard
for
the
dignity
of
the
state
as
had
the
great
and
glorious
john
hancock
in
the
beginning
the
founders
of
this
government
were
true
democratic
men
democracy
was
state
rights
and
state
rights
was
democracy
and
it
is
so
your
resolutions
breathe
it
the
declaration
of
independence
embodied
the
sentiments
which
had
lived
in
the
hearts
of
the
country
for
many
years
before
its
formal
assertion
our
fathers
asserted
the
great
principle
the
right
of
the
people
to
choose
their
own
government
and
that
government
rested
upon
the
consent
of
the
governed
in
every
form
of
expression
it
uttered
the
same
idea
community
independence
and
the
dependence
of
the
union
upon
the
communities
of
which
it
consisted
it
was
an
american
declaration
of
the
unalienable
right
of
man
it
was
a
general
truth
and
i
wish
it
were
accepted
by
all
men
but
i
have
said
that
this
state
sovereignty
this
community
independence
has
never
been
surrendered
and
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
federal
government
to
coerce
a
state
will
any
one
ask
me
then
how
a
state
is
to
be
held
to
the
fulfillment
of
its
obligations
my
answer
is
by
its
honor
the
obligation
is
the
more
sacred
to
observe
every
feature
of
the
compact
because
there
is
no
power
to
enforce
it
the
great
error
of
the
confederation
was
that
it
attempted
to
act
upon
the
states
it
was
found
impracticable
and
our
present
form
of
government
was
adopted
which
acts
upon
individuals
and
is
not
designed
to
act
upon
states
the
question
of
state
coercion
was
raised
in
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
and
after
discussion
the
proposition
to
give
power
to
the
general
government
to
enforce
against
any
state
obedience
to
the
laws
was
rejected
it
is
upon
the
ground
that
a
state
can
not
be
coerced
that
observance
of
the
compact
is
a
sacred
obligation
it
was
upon
this
principle
that
our
fathers
depended
for
the
perpetuity
of
a
fraternal
union
and
for
the
security
of
the
rights
that
the
constitution
was
designed
to
preserve
the
fugitive
slave
compact
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
implied
that
the
states
should
fulfill
it
voluntarily
they
expected
the
states
to
legislate
so
as
to
secure
the
rendition
of
fugitives
and
in
it
was
a
matter
of
complaint
that
the
spanish
colony
of
florida
did
not
restore
fugitive
negroes
from
the
united
states
who
escaped
into
that
colony
and
a
committee
composed
of
hamilton
of
new
york
sedgwick
of
massachusetts
and
mason
of
virginia
reported
resolutions
in
the
congress
instructing
the
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
to
address
the
at
madrid
to
apply
to
his
majesty
of
spain
to
issue
orders
to
his
governor
to
compel
them
to
secure
the
rendition
of
fugitive
negroes
this
was
the
sentiment
of
the
committee
and
they
added
also
that
the
states
would
return
any
slaves
from
florida
who
might
escape
into
their
limits
when
the
constitutional
obligation
was
imposed
who
could
have
doubted
that
every
state
faithful
to
its
obligations
would
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
and
waive
all
questions
as
to
whether
the
institution
should
or
should
not
exist
in
another
community
over
which
they
had
no
control
congress
was
at
last
forced
to
legislate
on
the
subject
and
they
have
continued
up
to
a
recent
period
to
legislate
and
this
has
been
one
of
the
causes
by
which
you
have
been
disturbed
you
have
been
called
upon
to
make
war
against
a
law
which
need
never
to
have
been
enacted
if
each
state
had
done
the
duty
which
she
was
called
upon
by
the
constitution
to
perform
gentlemen
this
presents
one
phase
of
agitation
negro
agitation
there
is
another
and
graver
question
it
is
in
relation
to
the
prohibition
by
congress
of
the
introduction
of
slave
property
into
the
territories
what
power
does
congress
possess
in
this
connection
has
it
the
right
to
say
what
shall
be
property
anywhere
if
it
has
from
what
clause
of
the
constitution
does
it
derive
that
power
have
other
states
the
power
to
prescribe
the
condition
upon
which
a
citizen
of
another
state
shall
enter
upon
and
enjoy
territory
common
property
of
all
clearly
not
shall
the
inhabitants
who
first
go
into
the
territory
deprive
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
those
rights
which
belong
to
him
as
an
equal
owner
of
the
soil
certainly
not
sovereign
jurisdiction
can
only
pass
to
these
inhabitants
when
the
states
the
owners
of
that
territory
shall
recognize
their
right
to
become
an
equal
member
of
the
union
until
then
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
union
must
be
the
rule
governing
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
the
constitution
recognizes
all
property
and
gives
equal
privileges
to
every
citizen
of
the
states
and
it
would
be
a
violation
of
its
fundamental
principles
to
attempt
any
discrimination
there
is
nothing
of
truth
or
justice
with
which
to
sustain
this
agitation
or
ground
for
it
unless
it
be
that
it
is
a
very
good
bridge
over
which
to
pass
into
office
a
little
stock
of
trade
in
politics
built
up
to
aid
men
who
are
missionaries
staying
at
home
reformers
of
things
which
they
do
not
go
to
learn
preachers
without
a
congregation
overseers
without
laborers
and
without
wages
who
snuff
the
battle
afar
off
and
cry
aha
aha
i
am
afar
off
thus
it
is
that
the
peace
of
the
union
is
disturbed
thus
it
is
that
brother
is
arrayed
against
brother
thus
it
is
that
the
people
come
to
consider
not
how
they
can
promote
each
other
interests
but
how
they
may
successfully
war
upon
them
and
among
the
things
most
odious
to
my
mind
is
to
find
a
man
who
enters
upon
a
public
office
under
the
sanction
of
the
constitution
and
taking
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
the
compact
between
the
states
binding
each
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
of
the
other
and
retaining
to
himself
a
mental
reservation
that
he
will
war
upon
the
institutions
and
the
property
of
any
of
the
states
of
the
union
it
is
a
crime
too
low
to
characterize
as
it
deserves
before
this
assembly
it
is
one
which
would
disgrace
a
gentleman
one
which
a
man
with
would
never
commit
to
swear
that
he
will
support
the
constitution
to
take
an
office
which
belongs
in
many
of
its
relations
to
all
the
states
and
to
use
it
as
a
means
of
injuring
a
portion
of
the
states
of
whom
he
is
thus
an
agent
is
treason
to
everything
that
is
honorable
in
man
it
is
the
base
and
cowardly
attack
of
him
who
gains
the
confidence
of
another
in
order
that
he
may
wound
him
but
i
have
often
heard
it
argued
and
i
have
seen
it
published
i
have
seen
a
petition
that
was
circulated
for
signers
announcing
that
there
was
an
incompatibility
between
the
different
sections
of
the
union
that
it
had
been
tried
long
enough
and
that
they
must
get
rid
of
those
sections
in
which
the
curse
of
slavery
existed
ah
those
sages
so
much
wiser
than
our
fathers
have
found
out
that
there
is
incompatibility
in
that
which
existed
when
the
union
was
formed
they
have
found
an
incompatibility
inconsistent
with
union
in
that
which
existed
when
south
carolina
sent
her
rice
to
boston
and
maryland
and
pennsylvania
and
new
york
brought
in
their
funds
for
her
relief
the
fact
is
that
from
that
day
to
this
the
difference
between
the
people
of
the
colonies
has
been
steadily
diminishing
and
the
possible
advantages
of
union
in
no
small
degree
augmented
the
variety
of
product
of
soil
and
of
climate
has
been
multiplied
both
by
the
expansion
of
our
country
and
by
the
introduction
of
new
tropical
products
not
cultivated
at
that
time
so
that
every
motive
to
union
which
your
fathers
had
in
a
diversity
which
should
give
prosperity
to
the
country
exists
in
a
higher
degree
than
when
this
union
was
formed
and
this
diversity
is
fundamental
to
the
prosperity
of
the
people
of
the
several
sections
of
the
country
it
is
however
in
sentiment
and
interest
less
than
on
the
day
when
the
declaration
of
independence
was
made
diversity
there
is
diversity
of
character
but
it
is
not
of
that
extreme
kind
which
proves
incompatibility
for
your
massachusetts
man
when
he
comes
into
mississippi
adopts
our
opinions
and
our
institutions
and
frequently
becomes
the
most
extreme
man
among
us
as
our
country
has
extended
as
new
products
have
been
introduced
into
it
this
union
and
the
free
trade
that
belongs
to
it
have
been
of
increasing
value
and
i
say
moreover
that
it
is
not
an
unfortunate
circumstance
that
this
diversity
of
pursuit
and
character
still
remains
originally
it
sprang
in
no
small
degree
from
natural
causes
massachusetts
became
a
manufacturing
and
commercial
state
because
of
her
fine
harbors
because
of
her
making
its
last
leap
into
the
sea
so
that
the
ship
of
commerce
brought
the
staple
to
the
manufacturing
power
this
made
you
a
commercial
and
a
manufacturing
people
in
the
southern
states
great
plains
interpose
between
the
last
leaps
of
the
streams
and
the
sea
those
plains
were
cultivated
in
staple
crops
and
the
sea
brought
their
products
to
your
streams
to
be
manufactured
this
was
the
first
beginning
of
the
differences
then
your
longer
and
more
severe
winters
your
soil
not
so
favorable
for
agriculture
in
a
degree
kept
you
a
manufacturing
and
a
commercial
people
even
after
the
cause
had
passed
away
after
railroads
had
been
built
after
the
had
become
a
motive
power
for
a
large
part
of
manufacturing
machinery
the
natural
causes
from
which
your
people
obtained
a
manufacturing
ascendancy
and
ours
became
chiefly
agriculturists
continued
to
act
in
a
considerable
measure
to
preserve
that
relation
your
interest
is
to
remain
a
manufacturing
and
ours
to
remain
an
agricultural
people
your
prosperity
then
is
to
receive
our
staple
and
to
manufacture
it
and
ours
to
sell
it
to
you
and
buy
the
manufactured
goods
this
is
an
interweaving
of
interests
which
makes
us
all
the
richer
and
happier
but
this
accursed
agitation
this
intermeddling
with
the
affairs
of
other
people
is
that
alone
which
will
promote
a
desire
in
the
mind
of
any
one
to
separate
these
great
and
glorious
states
the
seeds
of
dissension
may
be
sown
by
invidious
reflections
men
may
be
goaded
by
the
constant
attempts
to
infringe
upon
rights
and
to
disturb
tranquillity
and
in
the
resentment
which
follows
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
how
far
the
wave
may
rush
i
therefore
plead
to
you
now
to
arrest
a
fanaticism
which
has
been
evil
in
the
beginning
and
must
be
evil
in
the
end
you
may
not
have
the
numerical
power
requisite
and
those
at
a
distance
may
not
understand
how
many
of
you
there
are
desirous
to
put
a
stop
to
the
course
of
this
agitation
for
me
i
have
learned
since
i
have
been
in
new
england
the
vast
mass
of
true
democrats
to
be
found
within
its
limits
though
not
represented
in
the
halls
of
congress
and
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
if
availing
themselves
of
a
majority
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
they
should
attempt
to
trample
upon
the
constitution
if
they
should
attempt
to
violate
the
rights
of
the
states
if
they
should
attempt
to
infringe
upon
our
equality
in
the
union
i
believe
that
even
in
massachusetts
though
it
has
not
had
a
representative
in
congress
for
many
a
day
the
democracy
in
whose
breasts
beats
the
spirit
of
the
revolution
can
and
will
whip
the
black
republicans
i
trust
we
shall
never
be
thus
purified
as
it
were
by
fire
but
that
the
peaceful
progressive
revolution
of
the
will
answer
all
the
glorious
purposes
of
the
constitution
and
the
union
and
i
marked
that
the
distinguished
orator
and
statesman
who
preceded
me
in
addressing
you
used
the
words
national
and
constitutional
in
such
relation
to
each
other
as
to
show
that
in
his
mind
the
one
was
a
synonym
of
the
other
i
say
so
we
became
national
by
the
constitution
the
bond
for
uniting
the
states
and
national
and
constitutional
are
convertible
terms
your
candidate
for
the
high
office
of
governor
whom
i
have
been
once
or
twice
on
the
point
of
calling
governor
and
whom
i
hope
i
may
be
able
soon
to
call
so
in
his
remarks
to
you
has
presented
the
same
idea
in
another
form
and
well
may
massachusetts
orators
without
even
perceiving
what
they
are
saying
utter
sentiments
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
your
colonial
as
well
as
your
subsequent
political
history
which
existed
in
massachusetts
before
the
revolution
and
have
existed
ever
since
whenever
the
true
spirit
which
comes
down
from
the
revolutionary
sires
has
swelled
and
found
utterance
within
her
limits
it
has
been
not
only
my
friends
in
this
increasing
and
mutual
dependence
of
interest
that
we
have
found
new
ties
to
you
those
bonds
are
both
material
and
mental
every
improvement
or
invention
every
construction
of
a
railroad
has
formed
a
new
reason
for
our
being
one
every
new
achievement
whether
it
has
been
in
arts
or
science
in
war
or
in
manufactures
has
constituted
for
us
a
new
bond
and
a
new
sentiment
holding
us
together
why
then
i
would
ask
do
we
see
these
lengthened
shadows
which
follow
in
the
course
of
our
political
history
is
it
because
our
sun
is
declining
to
the
horizon
are
they
the
shadows
of
evening
or
are
they
as
i
hopefully
believe
but
the
mists
which
are
exhaled
by
the
sun
as
it
rises
but
which
are
to
be
dispersed
by
its
meridian
glory
are
they
but
the
little
evanishing
clouds
that
flit
between
the
people
and
the
great
objects
for
which
the
constitution
was
established
i
hopefully
look
toward
the
reaction
which
will
establish
the
fact
that
our
sun
is
still
in
the
ascendant
that
that
cloud
which
has
so
long
covered
our
political
horizon
is
to
be
dispersed
that
we
are
not
again
to
be
divided
on
parallels
of
latitude
and
about
the
domestic
institutions
of
states
a
sectional
attack
on
the
prosperity
and
tranquillity
of
a
nation
but
only
by
differences
in
opinion
upon
measures
of
expediency
upon
questions
of
relative
interest
by
discussions
as
to
the
powers
of
the
states
and
the
rights
of
the
states
and
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
such
discussion
as
is
commemorated
in
this
picture
of
your
own
great
and
glorious
webster
when
he
specially
addressed
our
best
most
tried
and
greatest
man
the
pure
and
incorruptible
calhoun
represented
as
intently
listening
to
catch
the
accents
of
eloquence
that
fell
from
his
lips
those
giants
strove
each
for
his
conviction
not
against
a
section
not
against
each
other
they
stood
to
each
other
in
the
relation
of
personal
affection
and
esteem
and
never
did
i
see
webster
so
agitated
never
did
i
hear
his
voice
falter
as
when
he
delivered
the
eulogy
on
john
calhoun
but
allusion
was
made
to
my
own
connection
with
your
great
and
favorite
departed
statesman
of
that
i
will
only
say
on
this
occasion
that
very
early
in
my
congressional
life
webster
was
arraigned
for
an
offense
which
affected
him
most
deeply
he
was
no
accountant
and
all
knew
that
he
was
arraigned
on
a
pecuniary
charge
the
misapplication
of
what
is
known
as
the
fund
and
i
was
one
of
the
committee
that
had
to
investigate
the
charge
i
endeavored
to
do
justice
i
endeavored
to
examine
the
evidence
with
a
view
to
ascertain
the
truth
it
is
true
i
remembered
that
he
was
an
eminent
american
statesman
it
is
true
that
as
an
american
i
hoped
he
would
come
out
without
a
stain
upon
his
garments
but
i
entered
upon
the
investigation
to
find
the
truth
and
to
do
justice
the
result
was
he
was
acquitted
of
every
charge
that
was
made
against
him
and
it
was
equally
my
pride
and
my
pleasure
to
vindicate
him
in
every
form
which
lay
within
my
power
no
one
that
knew
daniel
webster
could
have
believed
that
he
would
ever
ask
whether
a
charge
was
made
against
a
massachusetts
man
or
a
mississippian
no
it
belonged
to
a
lower
to
a
later
and
i
trust
a
race
of
statesmen
who
measure
all
facts
by
considerations
of
latitude
and
longitude
i
honor
that
sentiment
which
makes
us
oftentimes
too
confident
and
to
despise
too
much
the
danger
of
that
agitation
which
disturbs
the
peace
of
the
country
i
respect
that
feeling
which
regards
the
union
as
too
strong
to
be
broken
but
at
the
same
time
in
sober
judgment
it
will
not
do
to
treat
too
lightly
the
danger
which
has
existed
and
still
exists
i
have
heard
our
constitution
and
union
compared
to
the
granite
shores
which
face
the
sea
and
dashing
back
the
foam
of
the
waves
stand
unmoved
by
their
fury
now
i
accept
the
simile
and
i
have
stood
upon
the
shore
and
i
have
seen
the
waves
of
the
sea
dash
upon
the
granite
of
your
own
shores
which
frowns
over
the
ocean
have
seen
the
spray
thrown
back
from
the
cliffs
but
when
the
tide
had
ebbed
i
saw
that
the
rock
was
seamed
and
worn
and
when
the
tide
was
low
the
pieces
that
had
been
riven
from
the
granite
rock
were
lying
at
its
base
and
thus
the
waves
of
sectional
agitation
are
dashing
themselves
against
the
granite
patriotism
of
the
land
but
even
that
must
show
the
seams
and
scars
of
the
conflict
sectional
hostility
will
follow
the
danger
lies
at
your
door
and
it
is
time
to
arrest
it
too
long
have
we
allowed
this
influence
to
progress
it
is
time
that
men
should
go
back
to
the
first
foundation
of
our
institutions
they
should
drink
the
waters
of
the
fountain
at
the
source
of
our
colonial
and
early
history
you
men
of
boston
go
to
the
street
where
the
massacre
occurred
in
there
you
should
learn
how
your
fathers
strove
for
community
rights
and
near
the
same
spot
you
should
learn
how
proudly
the
delegation
of
democracy
came
to
demand
the
removal
of
the
troops
from
boston
and
how
the
venerable
samuel
adams
stood
asserting
the
rights
of
democracy
dauntless
as
hampden
clear
and
eloquent
as
sidney
and
how
they
drove
out
the
myrmidons
who
had
trampled
on
the
rights
of
the
people
all
over
our
country
these
monuments
instructive
to
the
present
generation
of
what
our
fathers
did
are
to
be
found
in
the
library
of
your
association
for
the
collection
of
your
early
history
i
found
a
letter
descriptive
of
the
reading
of
the
church
service
to
his
army
by
general
washington
during
one
of
those
winters
when
the
army
was
and
without
shoes
when
he
built
a
little
for
a
and
there
reading
the
service
to
them
his
sight
failed
him
he
put
on
his
glasses
and
with
emotion
which
manifested
the
reality
of
his
feelings
said
i
have
grown
gray
in
serving
my
country
and
now
i
am
growing
blind
by
the
aid
of
your
records
you
may
call
before
you
the
day
when
the
delegation
of
the
army
of
the
democracy
of
boston
demanded
compliance
with
its
requirements
for
the
removal
of
the
troops
a
painfully
thrilling
case
will
be
found
in
the
heroic
conduct
of
your
friends
the
patriots
in
charleston
south
carolina
the
prisoners
were
put
upon
the
hulks
where
the
existed
and
where
they
were
brought
on
shore
to
stay
the
progress
of
the
infection
and
were
offered
if
they
would
enlist
in
his
majesty
service
release
from
all
their
sufferings
present
and
prospective
while
if
they
would
not
the
rations
would
be
taken
from
their
families
and
they
would
be
sent
back
to
the
hulks
and
again
exposed
to
the
infection
emaciated
as
they
were
with
the
prospect
of
being
returned
to
confinement
and
their
families
turned
out
into
the
streets
the
spirit
of
independence
the
devotion
to
liberty
was
so
supreme
in
their
breasts
that
they
gave
one
loud
huzza
for
general
washington
and
went
to
meet
death
in
their
loathsome
prison
from
these
glorious
recollections
from
the
emotions
which
they
create
when
the
sacrifices
of
those
who
gave
you
the
heritage
of
liberty
are
read
in
your
early
history
the
eye
is
directed
to
our
present
condition
mark
the
prosperity
the
growth
the
honorable
career
of
your
country
under
the
voluntary
union
of
independent
states
i
do
not
envy
the
heart
of
that
american
whose
pulse
does
not
beat
quicker
and
who
does
not
feel
within
him
a
high
exultation
and
pride
in
the
past
glory
and
future
prospects
of
his
country
with
these
prospects
are
associated
if
we
are
only
wise
true
and
faithful
if
we
shun
sectional
dissension
all
that
man
can
conceive
of
the
progression
of
the
american
people
and
the
only
danger
which
threatens
those
high
prospects
is
that
miserable
spirit
which
disregarding
the
obligations
of
honor
makes
war
upon
the
constitution
which
induces
men
to
assume
powers
they
do
not
possess
trampling
as
well
upon
the
great
principles
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution
of
the
union
as
upon
the
honorable
obligations
which
were
fixed
upon
them
by
their
fathers
they
with
internecine
strife
would
sacrifice
themselves
and
their
brethren
to
a
spirit
which
is
a
disgrace
to
our
common
country
with
these
views
it
will
not
be
surprising
to
those
who
most
differ
from
me
that
i
feel
an
ardent
desire
for
the
success
of
this
democracy
that
convinced
as
i
am
of
the
ill
consequences
of
the
described
heresies
unless
they
be
corrected
of
the
evils
upon
which
they
would
precipitate
the
country
unless
they
are
restrained
i
say
none
need
be
surprised
if
prompted
by
such
aspirations
and
impressed
by
such
forebodings
as
now
open
themselves
before
me
i
have
spoken
freely
yielding
to
motives
i
would
suppress
and
can
not
avoid
i
have
often
elsewhere
than
in
the
state
of
which
i
am
a
citizen
spoken
in
favor
of
that
party
which
alone
is
national
in
which
alone
lies
the
hope
of
preserving
the
constitution
and
the
perpetuation
of
the
government
and
of
the
blessings
which
it
was
ordained
and
established
to
secure
my
friends
my
brethren
my
countrymen
i
thank
you
for
the
patient
attention
you
have
given
me
it
is
the
first
time
it
has
ever
befallen
me
to
address
an
audience
here
it
will
probably
be
the
last
residing
in
a
remote
section
of
the
country
with
private
as
well
as
public
duties
to
occupy
the
whole
of
my
time
it
would
only
be
for
a
very
hurried
visit
or
under
some
such
necessity
for
a
restoration
to
health
as
brought
me
here
this
season
that
i
could
ever
expect
to
remain
long
among
you
or
in
any
other
portion
of
the
union
than
the
state
of
which
i
am
a
citizen
i
have
staid
long
enough
to
feel
that
generous
hospitality
which
evinces
itself
which
has
evinced
itself
in
boston
since
i
have
been
here
and
showed
itself
in
every
town
and
village
of
new
england
where
i
have
gone
i
have
staid
here
too
long
enough
to
learn
that
though
not
represented
in
congress
there
is
a
large
mass
of
as
true
democrats
as
are
to
be
found
in
any
portion
of
the
union
within
the
limits
of
new
england
their
purposes
their
construction
of
the
constitution
their
hopes
for
the
future
their
respect
for
the
past
is
the
same
as
that
which
exists
among
my
beloved
brethren
in
mississippi
in
the
hour
of
apprehension
i
shall
turn
back
to
my
observations
here
in
this
consecrated
hall
where
men
so
early
devoted
themselves
to
liberty
and
community
independence
and
i
shall
endeavor
to
impress
upon
others
who
know
you
only
as
you
are
represented
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
how
true
and
how
many
are
the
hearts
that
beat
for
constitutional
liberty
and
faithfully
respect
every
clause
and
guarantee
which
the
constitution
contains
for
any
and
every
portion
of
the
union
appendix
speech
of
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
on
the
resolutions
offered
by
him
relative
to
the
relations
of
the
states
the
federal
government
and
the
territories
may
president
among
the
many
blessings
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
our
ancestry
is
that
of
transmitting
to
us
a
written
constitution
a
fixed
standard
to
which
in
the
progress
of
events
every
case
may
be
referred
and
by
which
it
may
be
measured
but
for
this
the
wise
men
who
formed
our
government
dared
not
have
hoped
for
its
perpetuity
for
they
saw
floating
down
the
tide
of
time
wreck
after
wreck
marking
the
short
life
of
every
republic
which
had
preceded
them
with
this
however
to
check
to
restrain
and
to
direct
their
posterity
they
might
reasonably
hope
the
government
they
founded
should
last
for
ever
that
it
should
secure
the
great
purposes
for
which
it
was
ordained
and
established
that
it
would
be
the
shield
of
their
posterity
equally
in
every
part
of
the
country
and
equally
in
all
time
to
come
it
was
this
which
mainly
distinguished
the
formation
of
our
government
from
those
confederacies
or
republics
which
had
preceded
it
and
this
is
the
best
foundation
for
our
hope
the
resolutions
which
have
been
read
and
which
i
had
the
honor
to
present
to
the
senate
are
little
more
than
the
announcement
of
what
i
hold
to
be
the
declarations
of
the
constitution
itself
to
that
fixed
standard
it
is
sought
at
this
time
when
we
are
drifting
far
from
the
initial
point
and
when
clouds
and
darkness
hover
over
us
to
bring
back
the
government
and
to
test
our
condition
by
the
rules
which
our
fathers
laid
down
for
us
in
the
beginning
the
differences
which
exist
between
different
portions
of
the
country
the
rivalries
and
the
jealousies
of
though
differing
in
degree
are
exactly
of
the
nature
of
those
which
preceded
the
formation
of
the
constitution
our
fathers
were
aware
of
the
different
interests
of
the
navigating
and
planting
states
as
they
were
then
regarded
they
sought
to
compose
those
difficulties
and
by
compensating
advantages
given
by
one
to
the
other
to
form
a
government
equal
and
just
in
its
operation
and
which
like
the
gentle
showers
of
heaven
should
fall
twice
blessed
blessing
him
that
gives
and
him
that
receives
this
beneficial
action
and
reaction
between
the
different
interests
of
the
country
constituted
the
bond
of
union
and
the
motive
of
its
formation
they
constitute
it
if
we
are
sufficiently
wise
to
appreciate
our
interests
and
sufficiently
faithful
to
observe
our
trust
indeed
with
the
extension
of
territory
with
the
multiplication
of
interests
with
the
varieties
increasing
from
time
to
time
of
the
products
of
this
great
country
the
bonds
which
bind
the
union
together
should
have
increased
rationally
considered
they
have
increased
because
the
free
trade
which
was
established
in
the
beginning
has
now
become
more
valuable
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
than
their
trade
with
all
the
rest
of
the
world
i
do
not
propose
to
argue
questions
of
natural
rights
and
inherent
powers
i
plant
my
reliance
upon
the
constitution
that
constitution
which
you
have
all
sworn
to
support
that
constitution
which
you
have
solemnly
pledged
yourself
to
maintain
while
you
hold
the
seat
you
now
occupy
in
the
senate
to
which
you
are
bound
in
its
spirit
and
in
its
letter
not
grudgingly
but
willingly
to
render
your
obedience
and
support
as
long
as
you
hold
office
under
the
federal
government
when
the
tempter
entered
the
garden
of
eden
and
induced
our
common
mother
to
offend
against
the
law
which
god
had
given
to
her
through
adam
he
was
the
first
teacher
of
that
higher
law
which
sets
the
will
of
the
individual
above
the
solemn
rule
which
he
is
bound
as
a
part
of
every
community
to
observe
from
the
effect
of
the
introduction
of
that
higher
law
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
fall
consequent
upon
it
came
sin
into
the
world
and
from
sin
came
death
and
banishment
and
subjugation
as
the
punishment
of
sin
the
loss
of
life
unfettered
liberty
and
perfect
happiness
followed
from
that
first
great
law
which
was
given
by
god
to
fallen
man
why
then
shall
we
talk
about
natural
rights
who
is
to
define
them
where
is
the
judge
who
is
to
sit
over
the
court
to
try
natural
rights
what
is
the
era
at
which
you
will
fix
the
date
by
which
you
will
determine
the
breadth
the
length
and
the
depth
of
those
called
the
rights
of
nature
shall
it
be
after
the
fall
when
the
earth
was
covered
with
thorns
and
man
had
to
earn
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
or
shall
it
be
when
there
was
equality
between
the
sexes
when
he
lived
in
the
garden
when
all
his
wants
were
supplied
and
when
thorns
and
thistles
were
unknown
on
the
face
of
the
earth
shall
it
be
then
shall
it
be
after
the
flood
when
for
the
first
sin
committed
after
the
waters
retired
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
doom
of
slavery
was
fixed
upon
the
mongrel
descendants
of
ham
if
after
the
flood
and
after
that
decree
how
idle
is
all
this
prating
about
natural
rights
as
standing
above
the
obligations
of
civil
government
the
constitution
is
the
law
supreme
to
every
american
it
is
the
plighted
faith
of
our
fathers
it
is
the
hope
of
our
posterity
i
say
then
i
come
not
to
argue
questions
outside
of
or
above
the
constitution
but
to
plead
the
cause
of
right
of
law
and
order
under
the
constitution
and
to
plead
it
to
those
who
have
sworn
to
abide
by
that
obligation
one
of
the
fruitful
sources
as
i
hold
it
of
the
errors
which
prevail
in
our
country
is
the
theory
that
this
is
a
government
of
one
people
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
formed
by
a
mass
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
a
compact
between
the
sovereign
members
who
formed
it
and
if
there
be
one
feature
common
to
all
the
colonies
planted
upon
the
shores
of
america
it
is
desire
for
community
independence
it
was
for
this
the
puritan
the
huguenot
the
catholic
the
quaker
the
protestant
left
the
land
of
their
nativity
and
guided
by
the
shadows
thrown
by
the
fires
of
european
persecution
they
sought
and
found
the
american
refuge
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
while
they
existed
as
separate
and
distinct
colonies
they
were
not
forbearing
toward
each
other
they
oppressed
opposite
religions
they
did
not
come
here
with
the
enlarged
idea
of
no
established
religion
the
puritans
drove
out
the
quakers
the
men
drove
out
the
catholics
persecution
reigned
through
the
colonies
except
perhaps
that
of
the
catholic
colony
of
maryland
but
the
rule
was
persecution
therefore
i
say
the
common
idea
and
the
only
common
idea
was
community
independence
the
right
of
each
independent
people
to
do
as
they
pleased
in
their
domestic
affairs
the
declaration
of
independence
was
made
by
the
colonies
each
for
itself
the
recognition
of
their
independence
was
not
for
the
colonies
united
but
for
each
of
the
colonies
which
had
maintained
its
independence
and
so
when
the
constitution
was
formed
the
delegates
were
not
elected
by
the
people
but
they
came
from
each
one
of
the
states
and
when
the
constitution
was
formed
it
was
referred
not
to
the
people
but
to
the
states
severally
and
severally
by
them
ratified
and
approved
but
if
there
be
anything
which
enforces
this
idea
more
than
another
it
is
the
unequal
dates
at
which
it
received
this
approval
from
first
to
last
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
elapsed
and
the
government
went
into
operation
something
like
a
year
i
believe
more
than
a
year
before
the
last
ratification
was
made
is
it
then
contended
that
by
this
ratification
and
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
states
surrendered
that
sovereignty
which
they
had
previously
gained
can
it
be
that
men
who
braved
the
perils
of
the
ocean
the
privations
of
the
wilderness
who
fought
the
war
of
the
revolution
in
the
hour
of
their
success
when
all
was
sunshine
and
peace
around
them
came
voluntarily
forward
to
lay
down
that
community
independence
for
which
they
had
suffered
so
much
and
so
long
reason
forbids
it
but
if
reason
did
not
furnish
a
sufficient
answer
the
action
of
the
states
themselves
forbids
it
the
great
state
of
new
york
great
relatively
then
as
she
is
now
manifested
her
wisdom
in
not
receiving
merely
that
implication
which
belongs
to
the
occasion
which
was
accepted
by
the
other
states
but
she
required
the
positive
assertion
of
that
retention
of
her
sovereignty
and
power
over
all
her
affairs
as
the
condition
on
which
she
ratified
the
constitution
itself
i
read
from
elliott
debates
page
among
her
resolutions
of
ratification
is
the
following
that
the
powers
of
government
may
be
reassumed
by
the
people
whensoever
it
shall
become
necessary
to
their
happiness
that
every
power
jurisdiction
and
right
which
is
not
by
the
said
constitution
clearly
delegated
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
the
departments
of
the
government
thereof
remain
to
the
people
of
the
several
states
or
to
their
respective
state
governments
to
which
they
may
have
granted
the
same
north
carolina
with
the
scotch
caution
which
subsequent
events
have
so
well
justified
in
passed
this
resolution
that
a
declaration
of
rights
asserting
and
securing
from
encroachments
the
great
principles
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
the
unalienable
rights
of
the
people
together
with
amendments
to
the
most
ambiguous
and
exceptionable
parts
of
the
said
constitution
of
government
ought
to
be
laid
before
congress
and
the
convention
of
the
states
that
shall
or
may
be
called
for
the
purpose
of
amending
the
said
constitution
for
their
consideration
previous
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
aforesaid
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
in
keeping
with
this
north
carolina
withheld
her
ratification
she
allowed
the
government
to
be
formed
with
the
number
of
states
which
was
required
to
put
it
in
operation
and
still
she
remained
out
of
the
union
asserting
and
recognized
in
the
independence
which
she
had
maintained
against
great
britain
and
which
she
had
no
idea
of
surrendering
to
any
other
power
and
the
last
state
which
ratified
the
constitution
long
after
it
had
in
fact
gone
into
effect
rhode
island
in
the
third
of
her
resolutions
says
iii
that
the
powers
of
government
may
be
reassumed
by
the
people
whensoever
it
shall
become
necessary
to
their
happiness
that
the
rights
of
the
states
respectively
to
nominate
and
appoint
all
state
officers
and
every
other
power
jurisdiction
and
right
which
is
not
by
the
said
constitution
clearly
delegated
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
the
departments
of

thereof
remain
to
the
people
of
the
several
states
or
their
respective
state
governments
to
whom
they
may
have
granted
the
same
here
the
use
of
the
phrase
state
governments
shows
how
utterly
unwarrantable
the
construction
has
been
to
say
that
the
reference
here
was
to
the
whole
people
of
the
states
to
the
people
of
all
the
states
and
not
to
the
people
of
each
of
the
states
severally
i
spoke
however
president
but
a
moment
ago
of
the
difference
of
politics
products
population
constituting
the
great
motive
for
the
union
it
was
indeed
its
necessity
had
all
the
people
been
alike
had
their
institutions
all
been
the
same
there
would
have
been
no
interest
to
bring
them
together
there
would
have
been
no
cause
or
necessity
for
any
restraint
being
imposed
upon
them
it
was
the
fact
that
they
differed
which
rendered
it
necessary
to
have
some
law
governing
their
intercourse
it
was
the
fact
that
their
products
were
opposite
that
their
pursuits
were
various
that
rendered
it
the
great
interest
of
the
people
that
they
should
have
free
trade
existing
among
each
other
that
free
trade
which
franklin
characterized
as
being
between
the
states
such
as
existed
between
the
counties
of
england
since
that
era
however
a
fiber
then
unknown
in
the
united
states
and
the
production
of
which
is
dependent
upon
the
domestic
institution
of
african
slavery
has
come
to
be
cultivated
in
such
amounts
to
enter
so
into
the
wearing
apparel
of
the
world
so
greatly
to
add
to
the
comfort
of
the
poor
that
it
may
be
said
that
that
little
fiber
cotton
wraps
the
commercial
world
and
binds
it
to
the
united
states
in
bonds
to
keep
the
peace
with
us
which
no
government
dare
break
it
has
built
up
the
northern
states
it
is
their
great
manufacturing
interest
it
supports
their
shipping
abroad
it
enables
them
to
purchase
in
the
markets
of
china
when
the
high
premium
to
be
paid
on
the
milled
dollar
would
otherwise
exclude
them
from
that
market
these
are
a
part
of
the
blessings
resulting
from
that
increase
and
variety
of
product
which
could
not
have
existed
if
we
had
all
been
alike
which
would
have
been
lost
unless
free
trade
between
the
united
states
was
still
preserved
and
here
it
strikes
me
as
somewhat
strange
that
a
book
recently
issued
has
received
the
commendation
of
a
large
number
of
the
representatives
of
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
states
though
apart
from
its
falsification
of
statistics
and
low
abuse
of
southern
states
institutions
and
interests
the
great
feature
which
stands
prominently
out
from
it
is
the
arraignment
of
the
south
for
using
their
surplus
money
in
buying
the
manufactures
of
the
north
how
a
manufacturing
and
commercial
people
can
be
truly
represented
by
those
who
would
inculcate
such
doctrines
as
these
is
to
me
passing
strange
is
it
vain
boasting
which
renders
you
anxious
to
proclaim
to
the
world
that
we
buy
our
buckets
our
rakes
and
our
shovels
from
you
no
there
is
too
much
good
sense
in
the
people
for
that
and
therefore
i
am
left
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
motive
unless
it
be
that
hate
which
makes
you
blind
to
your
own
interest
when
that
interest
is
weighed
in
the
balance
with
the
denunciation
and
detraction
of
your
brethren
of
the
south
the
great
principle
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
this
fixed
standard
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
the
equality
of
rights
between
the
states
this
was
essential
it
was
necessary
it
was
a
step
which
had
to
be
taken
first
before
any
progress
could
be
made
it
was
the
essential
requisite
of
the
very
idea
of
sovereignty
in
the
state
of
a
compact
voluntarily
entered
into
between
sovereigns
and
it
is
that
equality
of
right
under
the
constitution
on
which
we
now
insist
but
more
when
the
states
united
they
transferred
their
forts
their
armament
their
ships
and
their
right
to
maintain
armies
and
navies
to
the
federal
government
it
was
the
disarmament
of
the
states
under
the
operation
of
a
league
which
made
the
warlike
operations
the
powers
of
defense
common
to
them
all
then
with
this
equality
of
the
states
with
this
disarmament
of
the
states
if
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
constitution
to
express
it
i
say
the
protection
of
every
constitutional
right
would
follow
as
a
necessary
incident
and
could
not
be
denied
by
any
one
who
could
understand
and
would
admit
the
true
theory
of
such
a
government
we
claim
protection
first
because
it
is
our
right
secondly
because
it
is
the
duty
of
the
general
government
and
thirdly
because
we
have
entered
into
a
compact
together
which
deprives
each
state
of
the
power
of
using
all
the
means
which
it
might
employ
for
its
own
defense
this
is
the
general
theory
of
the
right
of
protection
what
is
the
exception
to
it
is
there
an
exception
if
so
who
made
it
does
the
constitution
discriminate
between
different
kinds
of
property
did
the
constitution
attempt
to
assimilate
the
institutions
of
the
different
states
confederated
together
was
there
a
single
state
in
this
union
that
would
have
been
so
unfaithful
to
the
principles
which
had
prompted
them
in
their
colonial
position
and
which
had
prompted
them
at
a
still
earlier
period
to
seek
and
try
the
temptations
of
the
wilderness
is
there
one
which
would
have
consented
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
control
or
to
discriminate
between
her
institutions
and
those
of
her
confederate
states
but
if
it
be
contended
that
this
is
argument
and
that
you
need
authority
i
will
draw
it
from
the
fountain
from
the
spring
before
it
had
been
polluted
from
the
debates
in
the
formation
of
the
constitution
from
the
views
of
those
who
at
least
it
will
be
admitted
understood
what
they
were
doing
randolph
it
will
be
recollected
introduced
a
for
a
government
consisting
of
a
series
of
resolutions
among
them
was
one
which
proposed
to
give
congress
the
power
to
call
forth
the
force
of
the
union
against
any
member
of
the
union
failing
to
fulfill
its
duty
under
the
articles
thereof
that
was
to
give
congress
the
power
to
coerce
the
states
to
bring
the
states
into
subjection
to
the
federal
government
now
sir
let
us
see
how
that
was
treated
and
first
i
will
refer
to
one
whose
wisdom
as
we
take
a
retrospective
view
seems
to
me
marvelous
not
conspicuous
in
debate
at
least
not
among
the
names
which
first
occur
when
we
think
of
that
bright
galaxy
of
patriots
and
statesmen
he
was
the
man
who
above
all
others
it
seems
to
me
laid
his
finger
upon
every
danger
and
indicated
the
course
which
that
danger
was
to
take
i
refer
to
mason
mason
observed
not
only
that
the
present
confederation
was
deficient
in
not
providing
for
coercion
and
punishment
against
delinquent
states
but
argued
very
cogently
that
punishment
could
not
in
the
nature
of
things
be
executed
on
the
states
collectively
and
therefore
that
such
a
government
was
necessary
as
could
directly
operate
on
individuals
and
would
punish
those
only
whose
guilt
required
it
madison
who
has
been
called
sometimes
the
father
of
the
constitution
upon
the
same
question
said
a
union
of
the
states
containing
such
an
ingredient
seemed
to
provide
for
its
own
destruction
the
use
of
force
against
a
state
would
look
more
like
a
declaration
of
war
than
an
infliction
of
punishment
and
would
probably
be
considered
by
the
party
attacked
as
a
dissolution
of
all
previous
compacts
by
which
it
might
be
bound
hamilton
who
if
i
were
to
express
a
judgment
by
way
of
comparison
i
would
say
was
the
master
intellect
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
whose
mind
seemed
to
penetrate
profoundly
every
question
with
which
he
grappled
and
who
seldom
failed
to
exhaust
the
subject
which
he
treated
hamilton
in
speaking
of
the
various
powers
necessary
to
maintain
a
government
came
to
clause
four
force
by
which
may
be
understood
a
of
laws
or
coercion
of
congress
have
not
the
former
except
in
few
cases
in
particular
states
this
coercion
is
nearly
sufficient
though
he
held
it
in
most
cases
not
entirely
so
a
certain
portion
of
military
force
is
absolutely
necessary
in
large
communities
massachusetts
is
now
feeling
this
necessity
and
making
provision
for
it
but
how
can
this
force
be
exerted
on
the
states
collectively
it
is
impossible
it
amounts
to
a
war
between
the
parties
foreign
powers
also
will
not
be
idle
spectators
they
will
interpose
the
confusion
will
increase
and
a
dissolution
of
the
union
will
ensue
the
consequence
was
the
proposition
was
lost
in
support
of
this
same
idea
of
community
independence
which
i
have
suggested
the
argument
upon
the
proposition
least
likely
to
have
exhibited
it
that
to
give
power
to
restrain
the
shows
the
northern
and
southern
men
all
arguing
and
presenting
different
views
yet
concurred
in
this
that
there
could
be
no
power
to
restrain
a
state
from
importing
what
she
pleased
as
the
senator
from
vermont
collamer
looks
somewhat
surprised
at
my
statement
i
will
refer
to
the
authority
rutledge
said
religion
and
humanity
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
question
interest
alone
is
the
governing
principle
with
nations
the
true
question
at
present
is
whether
the
southern
states
shall
or
shall
not
be
parties
to
the
union
if
the
northern
states
consult
their
interest
they
will
not
oppose
the
increase
of
slaves
which
will
increase
the
commodities
of
which
they
will
become
the
carriers
pinckney
south
carolina
can
never
receive
the
plan
if
it
prohibits
the
in
every
proposed
extension
of
the
powers
of
congress
that
state
has
expressly
and
watchfully
excepted
that
of
meddling
with
the
importation
of
negroes
if
the
states
be
all
left
at
liberty
on
this
subject
south
carolina
may
perhaps
by
degrees
do
of
herself
what
is
wished
as
virginia
and
maryland
already
have
done
sherman
was
for
leaving
the
clause
as
it
stands
he
disapproved
of
the
yet
as
the
states
were
now
possessed
of
the
right
to
import
slaves
as
the
public
good
did
not
require
it
to
be
taken
from
them
and
as
it
was
expedient
to
have
as
few
objections
as
possible
to
the
proposed
scheme
of
government
he
thought
it
best
to
leave
the
matter
as
we
find
it
baldwin
had
conceived
national
objects
alone
to
be
before
the
convention
not
such
as
like
the
present
were
of
a
local
nature
georgia
was
decided
on
this
point
that
state
has
always
hitherto
supposed
a
general
government
to
be
the
pursuit
of
the
central
states
who
wished
to
have
a
vortex
for
everything
that
her
distance
would
preclude
her
from
equal
advantage
and
that
she
could
not
prudently
purchase
it
by
yielding
national
powers
from
this
it
might
be
understood
in
what
light
she
would
view
an
attempt
to
abridge
one
of
her
favorite
prerogatives
if
left
to
herself
she
may
probably
put
a
stop
to
the
evil
as
one
ground
for
this
conjecture
he
took
notice
of
the
sect
of
which
he
said
was
a
respectable
class
of
people
who
carried
their
ethics
beyond
the
mere
of
extending
their
humanity
to
the
claims
of
the
whole
animal
creation
gerry
thought
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
the
states
as
to
slaves
but
ought
to
be
careful
not
to
give
any
sanction
to
it
king
thought
the
subject
should
be
considered
in
a
political
light
only
if
two
states
will
not
agree
to
the
constitution
as
stated
on
one
side
he
could
affirm
with
equal
belief
on
the
other
that
great
and
equal
opposition
would
be
experienced
from
the
other
states
he
remarked
on
the
exemption
of
slaves
from
duty
while
every
other
import
was
subjected
to
it
as
an
inequality
that
could
not
fail
to
strike
the
commercial
sagacity
of
the
northern
and
middle
states
here
as
will
be
observed
everywhere
was
recognized
and
admitted
the
doctrine
of
community
independence
and
state
equality
no
interference
with
the
institutions
of
a
state
no
interference
even
prospectively
save
and
except
with
their
consent
and
thus
it
followed
that
at
one
time
it
was
proposed
to
except
from
the
power
to
prohibit
the
further
introduction
of
africans
those
states
which
insisted
upon
retaining
the
power
and
finally
it
was
agreed
that
a
date
should
be
fixed
beyond
which
probably
none
of
them
desired
to
retain
it
these
were
states
acting
in
their
sovereign
capacity
they
possessed
power
to
do
as
they
pleased
and
that
was
the
view
which
they
took
of
it
i
ask
then
how
are
we
their
descendants
those
holding
under
their
authority
to
assume
a
power
which
they
refused
to
admit
upon
principles
eternal
and
lying
at
the
foundation
of
the
constitution
itself
if
then
there
be
no
such
distinction
or
discrimination
if
protection
be
the
duty
and
who
will
deny
it
with
which
this
government
is
charged
and
for
which
the
states
pay
taxes
because
of
which
they
surrendered
their
armies
and
their
navies
if
general
protection
be
the
general
duty
i
ask
in
the
name
of
reason
and
constitutional
right
i
ask
you
to
point
me
to
authority
by
which
a
discrimination
is
made
between
and
any
other
yet
this
is
the
question
now
fraught
with
evil
to
our
country
it
is
this
which
has
raised
the
hurricane
threatening
to
sweep
our
political
institutions
before
it
this
is
the
dark
spot
which
some
already
begin
to
fear
may
blot
out
the
constellation
of
the
union
from
the
political
firmament
of
mankind
does
it
not
become
us
then
calmly
to
consider
it
justly
to
weigh
it
to
hold
it
in
balances
from
which
the
dust
has
been
blown
in
order
that
we
may
see
where
truth
right
and
the
obligations
of
the
constitution
require
us
to
go
it
may
be
pardoned
to
one
who
from
his
earliest
youth
up
has
been
connected
with
a
particular
party
who
has
always
believed
that
the
welfare
and
the
safety
of
the
country
most
securely
rested
with
that
party
who
has
seen
in
the
triumph
of
democracy
the
triumph
of
the
union
and
who
has
believed
for
years
past
that
the
downfall
of
democracy
would
be
its
destruction
it
may
be
pardoned
i
say
under
such
circumstances
as
these
to
such
a
person
as
that
to
refer
even
in
this
connection
to
that
feature
of
the
particular
point
which
i
am
discussing
which
has
been
brought
forward
by
the
recent
action
of
that
party
states
met
together
to
consult
as
brethren
to
see
whether
they
could
agree
as
well
upon
the
candidate
as
upon
the
creed
and
it
was
apparent
that
division
had
entered
into
our
ranks
after
days
of
discussion
we
saw
that
party
convention
broken
we
saw
the
enemies
of
democracy
waiting
to
be
invited
to
its
funeral
and
jestingly
looking
into
the
blank
faces
of
those
of
us
to
whom
the
telegraph
brought
the
sad
intelligence
i
hope
this
is
however
but
the
mist
of
the
morning
i
have
faith
in
the
democracy
and
that
it
still
lives
i
have
faith
in
the
patriotism
and
in
the
good
sense
of
the
democracy
that
they
will
assert
the
truth
boldly
pronounce
it
meet
the
issue
and
i
trust
in
the
good
sense
and
patriotism
of
the
people
for
their
success
in
this
connection
it
may
be
permissible
to
review
our
present
party
condition
for
a
long
time
two
parties
divided
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
controversy
was
mainly
upon
questions
of
expediency
sometimes
of
constitutionality
they
divided
men
in
all
of
the
states
the
contest
was
sometimes
won
by
one
and
sometimes
by
the
other
the
whig
party
lives
now
but
in
history
yet
it
has
a
history
of
which
any
of
its
members
may
be
proud
it
bore
the
high
but
not
successful
part
of
stemming
the
tide
of
popular
impulse
and
thus
failed
to
attain
the
highest
power
differing
from
them
upon
the
points
at
issue
i
offer
the
homage
of
my
respect
to
those
who
adhering
to
what
they
believed
to
be
true
go
down
sooner
than
find
success
in
the
abandonment
of
principle
with
the
disappearance
of
that
party
and
perhaps
for
the
very
reasons
that
caused
its
disappearance
up
rose
radical
organizations
who
strode
so
far
beyond
progressive
democracy
that
democracy
took
the
place
now
left
vacant
by
the
old
whig
party
and
became
the
reservoir
into
which
all
conservatism
was
poured
therefore
it
is
that
so
many
of
those
men
eminent
in
their
day
eminent
for
their
services
eminent
in
their
history
have
approved
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
present
condition
of
the
country
as
the
only
conservative
element
which
remains
in
our
politics
in
the
midst
of
this
radicalism
of
this
revolutionary
tendency
it
becomes
not
the
regret
of
a
partisan
merely
it
is
the
sadness
of
an
american
citizen
that
the
party
on
which
the
conservative
hopes
of
the
country
hang
has
been
threatened
with
division
and
possibly
may
not
hereafter
be
united
thanks
to
a
sanguine
temperament
thanks
to
an
abiding
faith
thanks
to
a
confidence
in
the
providence
which
has
so
long
ruled
for
good
the
destiny
of
my
country
i
believe
it
will
reunite
and
reunite
upon
sound
and
acceptable
principles
at
least
i
hope
so
from
the
postulates
which
i
have
laid
down
result
the
fourth
and
fifth
resolutions
they
are
the
two
which
i
expect
to
be
opposed
they
contain
the
assertion
of
the
equality
of
rights
of
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
territories
and
they
declare
the
obligation
of
the
congress
to
see
these
rights
protected
i
admit
that
the
united
states
may
acquire
eminent
domain
i
admit
that
the
united
states
may
have
sovereignty
over
territory
otherwise
the
sovereign
jurisdiction
which
we
obtained
by
conquest
or
treaty
would
not
pass
to
us
i
deny
that
their
agent
the
federal
government
under
the
existing
constitution
can
have
eminent
domain
i
deny
that
it
can
have
sovereignty
i
consider
it
as
the
mere
agent
of
the
states
an
agent
of
limited
power
and
that
it
can
do
nothing
save
that
which
the
constitution
empowers
it
to
perform
and
that
though
the
treaty
or
the
deed
of
cession
may
direct
or
control
it
can
not
enlarge
or
expand
the
powers
of
the
congress
that
it
is
not
sovereign
in
any
essential
particular
it
has
functions
to
perform
and
those
functions
i
propose
now
to
consider
the
power
of
congress
over
the
territories
a
subject
not
well
defined
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
been
drawn
from
various
sources
by
different
advocates
of
that
power
one
has
found
it
in
the
grant
of
power
to
dispose
of
the
territory
and
other
public
property
that
is
to
say
because
the
agent
was
authorized
to
sell
a
particular
thing
or
to
dispose
of
it
by
grant
or
barter
therefore
he
has
sovereign
power
over
that
and
all
else
which
the
principal
constituting
him
an
agent
may
hereafter
acquire
the
property
besides
the
land
consisted
of
forts
of
ships
of
armaments
and
other
things
which
had
belonged
to
the
states
in
their
separate
capacity
and
were
turned
over
to
the
government
of
the
confederation
and
transferred
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
together
with
the
land
so
transferred
the
federal
government
had
the
power
to
dispose
and
of
territory
thereafter
acquired
of
arms
thereafter
made
or
purchased
of
forts
thereafter
constructed
or
or
docks
or
lights
or
buoys
of
all
these
of
course
it
had
power
to
dispose
it
had
the
power
to
create
them
it
must
of
necessity
have
had
the
power
to
dispose
of
them
it
was
only
necessary
to
confer
the
power
to
dispose
of
those
things
which
the
federal
government
did
not
create
of
those
things
which
came
to
it
from
the
states
and
over
which
they
might
signify
their
will
for
its
control
i
look
upon
it
as
the
mere
power
to
dispose
of
for
considerations
and
objects
defined
in
the
trust
the
land
held
in
the
united
states
none
of
which
then
was
within
the
limits
of
the
states
and
the
other
public
property
which
the
united
states
received
from
the
states
after
the
formation
of
the
union
i
do
not
agree
with
those
who
say
the
government
has
no
power
to
establish
a
temporary
and
civil
government
within
a
territory
i
stand
between
the
extremes
of
squatter
sovereignty
and
of
congressional
sovereignty
i
hold
that
the
congress
has
power
to
establish
a
civil
government
that
it
derives
it
from
the
grants
of
the
constitution
not
the
one
which
is
referred
to
and
i
hold
that
that
power
is
limited
and
restrained
first
by
the
constitution
itself
and
then
by
every
rule
of
popular
liberty
and
sound
discretion
to
the
narrowest
limits
which
the
necessities
of
the
case
require
the
congress
has
power
to
defend
the
territory
to
repel
invasion
to
suppress
insurrection
the
congress
has
power
to
see
the
laws
executed
for
this
it
may
have
a
civil
magistracy
territorial
courts
it
has
the
power
to
establish
a
federal
judiciary
to
that
federal
judiciary
from
these
local
courts
may
come
up
to
be
decided
questions
with
regard
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
these
combined
give
power
to
establish
a
temporary
government
sufficient
perhaps
for
the
simple
wants
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
territory
until
they
shall
acquire
the
population
until
they
shall
have
the
resources
and
the
interests
which
justify
them
in
becoming
a
state
i
am
sustained
in
this
view
of
the
case
by
an
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
in
the
case
of
lessee
hagan
howard
in
which
the
court
say
taking
the
legislative
acts
of
the
united
states
and
the
states
of
virginia
and
georgia
and
their
deeds
of
cession
to
the
united
states
and
giving
to
each
separately
and
to
all
jointly
a
fair
interpretation
we
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
invest
the
united
states
with
the
eminent
domain
of
the
country
ceded
both
national
and
municipal
for
the
purposes
of
temporary
government
and
to
hold
it
in
trust
for
the
performance
of
the
stipulations
and
conditions
expressed
in
the
deeds
of
cession
and
the
legislative
acts
connected
with
them
this
was
a
question
of
land
it
was
land
lying
between
high
and
low
water
over
which
the
united
states
claimed
to
have
and
to
exercise
authority
because
of
the
terms
on
which
alabama
had
been
admitted
into
the
union
in
that
connection
the
court
say
in
the
same
case
when
alabama
was
admitted
into
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
she
succeeded
to
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
jurisdiction
and
eminent
domain
which
georgia
possessed
at
the
date
of
the
cession
except
so
far
as
this
right
was
diminished
by
the
public
lands
remaining
in
the
possession
and
under
the
control
of
the
united
states
for
the
temporary
purpose
provided
for
in
the
deeds
of
cession
and
the
legislative
acts
connected
with
it
nothing
remained
in
the
united
states
according
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
but
the
public
lands
and
if
an
express
stipulation
had
been
inserted
in
the
agreement
granting
the
municipal
right
of
sovereignty
and
eminent
domain
to
the
united
states
such
stipulation
would
have
been
void
and
inoperative
because
the
united
states
has
no
constitutional
capacity
to
exercise
municipal
jurisdiction
sovereignty
or
eminent
domain
within
the
limits
of
a
state
or
elsewhere
except
in
the
cases
in
which
it
is
expressly
granted
another
case
arose
not
long
afterward
in
which
not
land
but
religion
was
involved
where
suit
was
brought
against
the
municipality
of
new
orleans
because
they
would
not
allow
a
dead
body
to
be
exposed
at
a
place
where
according
to
the
religious
rites
of
those
interested
it
was
deemed
they
had
a
right
thus
to
expose
it
on
that
the
supreme
court
say
speaking
of
the
ordinance
for
the
government
of
louisiana
so
far
as
they
conferred
political
rights
and
secured
civil
and
religious
liberties
which
are
political
rights
the
laws
of
congress
were
all
suspended
by
the
state
constitution
nor
is
any
part
of
them
in
force
unless
they
were
adopted
by
the
constitution
of
louisiana
as
laws
of
the
state
thus
we
find
the
supreme
court
sustaining
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
has
power
to
establish
a
temporary
civil
government
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
but
that
it
can
enact
no
law
which
will
endure
beyond
the
temporary
purposes
for
which
such
government
was
established
in
other
cases
the
decisions
of
the
court
run
in
the
same
line
and
in
the
then
most
learned
in
his
profession
and
in
what
else
is
he
not
learned
for
he
may
be
said
to
be
a
man
of
universal
acquirements
cushing
then
foretold
what
must
have
been
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
on
the
missouri
compromise
anticipating
the
decision
subsequently
made
in
the
case
of
dred
scott
that
decision
for
which
the
venerable
justices
have
been
so
often
and
so
violently
arraigned
he
foretold
it
as
the
necessary
consequence
from
the
line
of
precedents
descending
from
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
in
different
cases
and
now
bearing
on
a
case
similar
in
principle
and
only
different
in
the
mere
reference
to
the
subject
involved
from
those
which
had
gone
before
as
connected
with
the
decision
which
had
agitated
the
peace
of
the
country
as
the
anticipation
of
that
decision
before
it
was
made
viewing
it
as
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
decisions
which
the
court
had
made
before
if
it
be
the
pleasure
of
the
senate
i
ask
my
friend
from
south
carolina
chesnut
to
read
for
me
a
letter
of
the
being
an
official
answer
made
by
him
in
relation
to
the
military
reservation
which
was
involved
in
the
question
before
him
chesnut
read
from
the
opinions
of
the
vol
vii
page
the
supreme
court
has
determined
that
the
united
states
never
held
any
municipal
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
right
of
soil
in
the
territory
of
which
any
of
the
new
states
have
been
formed
except
for
temporary
purposes
and
to
execute
the
trusts
created
by
the
deeds
of
cession
by
the
force
of
the
same
principle
and
in
the
same
line
of
adjudications
the
supreme
court
would
have
had
to
decide
that
the
provision
of
the
act
of
march
which
undertakes
to
determine
in
advance
the
municipal
law
of
all
that
portion
of
the
original
province
of
louisiana
which
lies
north
of
the
parallel
north
latitude
was
null
and
void
if
it
had
not
been
repealed
by
a
recent
act
of
congress
compare
iv
statutes
at
large
and
x
statutes
at

for
an
act
of
congress
which
pretends
of
right
and
without
consent
or
compact
to
impose
on
the
municipal
power
of
any
new
state
or
states
limitations
and
restrictions
not
imposed
on
all
is
contrary
to
the
fundamental
condition
of
the
confederation
according
to
which
there
is
to
be
equality
of
right
between
the
old
and

states
all
respects
whatsoever
davis
it
was
not
long
after
this
official
opinion
of
the
before
the
case
arose
on
which
the
decision
was
made
which
has
so
agitated
the
country
fortunate
indeed
was
it
for
the
public
peace
that
land
and
religion
had
been
decided
those
questions
on
which
men
might
reason
had
been
the
foundation
of
judicial
decision
before
that
which
drives
all
reason
it
seems
from
the
mind
of
man
came
to
be
presented
the
question
whether
cuffee
should
be
kept
in
his
normal
condition
or
not
the
question
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
could
decide
what
might
or
might
not
be
property
in
a
territory
the
case
being
that
of
an
officer
of
the
army
sent
into
a
territory
to
perform
his
public
duty
having
taken
with
him
his
negro
slave
the
court
however
in
giving
their
decision
in
this
case
or
their
opinion
if
it
suits
gentlemen
better
have
gone
into
the
question
with
such
clearness
such
precision
and
such
amplitude
that
it
will
relieve
me
from
the
necessity
of
arguing
it
any
further
than
to
make
a
reference
to
some
sentences
contained
in
that
opinion
and
here
let
me
say
i
can
not
see
how
those
who
agreed
on
a
former
occasion
that
the
constitutional
right
of
the
slaveholder
to
take
his
property
into
the
territory
the
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
and
the
constitutional
power
of
the
territory
to
legislate
upon
that
subject
should
be
a
judicial
question
can
now
attempt
to
escape
the
operation
of
an
opinion
which
covers
the
exact
political
question
which
it
was
known
beforehand
the
court
would
be
called
upon
to
decide
decided
in
strictness
of
technical
language
it
was
known
it
could
not
be
hundreds
thousands
a
vast
variety
of
cases
may
arise
and
centuries
elapse
and
leave
that
court
if
our
union
still
exists
deciding
questions
in
relation
to
that
character
of
property
in
the
territories
but
the
great
and
fundamental
idea
was
that
after
thirty
years
of
angry
controversy
dividing
the
people
and
paralyzing
the
arm
of
the
federal
government
some
umpire
should
be
sought
which
would
compose
the
difficulty
and
set
it
upon
a
footing
to
leave
us
in
future
to
proceed
in
peace
and
that
umpire
was
selected
which
the
constitution
had
provided
to
decide
questions
of
law
i
ask
my
friend
to
read
some
extracts
from
the
decision
chesnut
read
as
follows
from
the
case
of
dred
scott
sandford
pp
the
territory
being
a
part
of
the
united
states
the
government
and
the
citizen
both
enter
it
under
the
authority
of
the
constitution
with
their
respective
rights
defined
and
marked
out
and
the
federal
government
can
exercise
no
power
over
his
person
or
property
beyond
what
that
instrument
confers
nor
lawfully
deny
any
right
which
it
has
reserved
the
powers
over
person
and
property
of
which
we
speak
are
not
only
not
granted
to
congress
but
are
in
express
terms
denied
and
they
are
forbidden
to
exercise
them
and
this
prohibition
is
not
confined
to
the
states
but
the
words
are
general
and
extend
to
the
whole
territory
over
which
the
constitution
gives
it
power
to
legislate
including
those
portions
of
it
remaining
under
territorial
government
as
well
as
that
covered
by
states
it
is
a
total
absence
of
power
everywhere
within
the
dominion
of
the
united
states
and
places
the
citizens
of
a
territory
so
far
as
these
rights
are
concerned
on
the
same
footing
with
citizens
of
the
states
and
guards
them
as
firmly
and
plainly
against
any
inroads
which
the
general
government
might
attempt
under
the
plea
of
implied
or
incidental
powers
and
if
congress
itself
can
not
do
this
if
it
is
beyond
the
powers
conferred
on
the
federal
government
it
will
be
admitted
we
presume
that
it
could
not
authorize
a
territorial
government
to
exercise
them
it
could
confer
no
power
on
any
local
government
established
by
its
authority
to
violate
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
if
the
constitution
recognizes
the
right
of
property
of
the
master
in
the
slave
and
makes
no
distinction
between
that
description
of
property
and
other
property
owned
by
a
citizen
no
tribunal
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
whether
it
be
legislative
executive
or
judicial
has
a
right
to
draw
such
a
distinction
or
deny
to
it
the
benefit
of
the
provisions
and
guarantees
which
have
been
provided
for
the
protection
of
private
property
against
the
encroachments
of
the
government
this
is
done
in
plain
words
too
plain
to
be
misunderstood
and
no
word
can
be
found
in
the
constitution
which
gives
congress
a
greater
power
over
or
which
entitles
property
of
that
kind
to
less
protection
than
property
of
any
other
description
the
only
power
conferred
is
the
power
coupled
with
the
duty
of
guarding
and
protecting
the
owner
in
his
rights
upon
these
considerations
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
act
of
congress
which
prohibited
a
citizen
from
holding
and
owning
property
of
this
kind
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states
north
of
the
line
therein
mentioned
is
not
warranted
by
the
constitution
and
is
therefore
void
and
that
neither
dred
scott
himself
nor
any
of
his
family
were
made
free
by
being
carried
into
this
territory
even
if
they
had
been
carried
there
by
the
owner
with
the
intention
of
becoming
a
permanent
resident
davis
here
then
president
i
say
the
umpire
selected
as
the
referee
in
the
controversy
has
decided
that
neither
the
congress
nor
its
agent
the
territorial
government
has
the
power
to
invade
or
impair
the
right
of
property
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
i
will
not
inquire
whether
it
be
technically
a
decision
or
not
it
was
obligatory
on
those
who
selected
the
umpire
and
agreed
to
abide
by
the
award
it
is
well
known
to
those
who
have
been
associated
with
me
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
question
i
have
been
the
determined
opponent
of
what
is
called
squatter
sovereignty
i
never
gave
it
countenance
and
i
am
now
least
of
all
disposed
to
give
it
quarter
in
it
made
its
appearance
for
good
purposes
it
was
ushered
in
by
a
great
and
good
man
he
brought
it
forward
because
of
that
distrust
which
he
had
in
the
capacity
of
the
government
to
bear
the
rude
shock
to
which
it
was
exposed
his
apprehension
no
doubt
to
some
extent
sharpened
and
directed
his
patriotism
and
his
reflection
led
him
to
a
conclusion
to
which
i
doubt
not
he
adheres
as
tenaciously
as
ever
but
from
which
it
was
my
fortune
good
or
ill
to
dissent
when
his
letter
was
read
to
me
in
manuscript
i
being
together
with
some
other
persons
asked
though
not
by
the
writer
whether
or
not
it
should
be
sent
at
the
first
blush
i
believed
it
to
be
a
fallacy
a
fallacy
fraught
with
mischief
that
it
escaped
an
issue
which
was
upon
us
which
it
was
our
duty
to
meet
that
it
escaped
it
by
a
side
path
which
led
to
a
greater
danger
i
thought
it
a
fallacy
which
would
surely
be
exploded
i
doubted
then
and
still
more
for
some
time
afterward
when
held
to
a
dread
responsibility
for
the
position
which
i
occupied
i
doubted
whether
i
should
live
to
see
that
fallacy
exploded
it
has
been
more
speedily
and
to
the
country
more
injuriously
than
i
anticipated
in
the
mean
time
what
has
been
its
operation
let
kansas
speak
the
first
great
field
on
which
the
trial
was
made
what
was
then
the
consequence
the
federal
government
withdrawing
control
leaving
the
contending
sections
excited
to
the
highest
point
upon
this
question
each
to
send
forth
its
army
kansas
became
the
and
kansas
the
cry
which
wellnigh
led
to
civil
war
this
was
the
first
fruit
more
deadly
than
the
fatal
upas
its
effect
was
not
limited
to
the
mere
spot
of
ground
on
which
the
dew
fell
from
its
leaves
but
it
spread
throughout
the
united
states
it
kindled
all
which
had
been
collected
for
years
of
inflammable
material
it
was
owing
to
the
strength
of
our
government
and
the
good
sense
of
the
quiet
masses
of
the
people
that
it
did
not
wrap
our
country
in
one
widespread
conflagration
what
right
had
congress
then
or
what
right
has
it
now
to
abdicate
any
power
conferred
upon
it
as
trustee
of
the
states
what
right
had
congress
then
or
has
it
now
to
shrink
from
the
performance
of
a
duty
because
the
mere
counters
spread
on
the
table
may
be
swept
off
when
they
have
not
answered
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
placed
what
is
it
to
you
or
me
or
any
one
when
we
weigh
our
own
continuation
in
place
against
the
great
interests
of
which
we
are
conservators
against
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
the
liberty
of
our
posterity
to
the
remotest
ages
what
is
it
i
say
which
can
be
counted
in
the
balance
on
our
side
against
the
performance
of
that
duty
which
is
imposed
upon
us
if
any
one
believes
congress
has
not
the
constitutional
power
he
acts
conscientiously
in
insisting
upon
congress
not
usurping
it
if
any
one
believes
that
the
squatters
upon
the
lands
of
the
united
states
within
a
territory
are
invested
with
sovereignty
having
won
it
by
some
of
those
processes
unknown
to
history
without
grant
or
without
revolution
without
money
and
without
price
he
adhering
to
the
theory
may
pursue
it
to
its
conclusion
to
the
first
class
those
who
claim
sovereign
power
over
the
territories
for
congress
i
say
lay
your
hand
upon
the
constitution
and
find
there
the
warrant
of
your
authority
of
the
second
those
of
whom
i
have
last
spoken
i
ask
in
the
constitution
reason
right
or
justice
what
is
there
to
sustain
your
theory
the
phraseology
which
has
been
employed
on
this
question
seems
to
me
to
betray
a
strange
confusion
of
ideas
to
speak
of
a
sovereignty
a
plenary
legislative
power
deriving
its
power
from
an
agent
a
sovereignty
held
subject
to
articles
with
the
formation
of
which
that
sovereignty
had
nothing
to
do
a
compact
to
which
it
was
not
a
party
you
say
to
a
sovereign
a
and
b
have
agreed
on
certain
terms
between
themselves
and
you
must
govern
your
conduct
according
to
them
yet
i
do
not
deny
your
sovereignty
that
is
the
power
to
do
as
they
please
provided
it
conforms
to
the
rule
which
others
chose
to
lay
down
can
this
be
a
definition
of
sovereignty
but
again
sir
nothing
seems
to
me
more
illogical
than
the
argument
that
this
power
is
acquired
by
a
grant
from
the
congress
connected
with
the
other
argument
that
congress
have
not
got
the
power
to
do
the
act
themselves
that
is
to
say
that
the
recipient
takes
more
than
the
giver
possessed
that
a
territorial
legislature
can
do
anything
which
a
state
legislature
can
do
and
that
subject
to
the
constitution
means
merely
the
restraints
imposed
upon
both
this
is
confounding
the
whole
theory
and
the
history
of
our
government
the
states
were
the
grantors
they
made
the
compact
they
gave
the
federal
agent
its
powers
they
inhibited
themselves
from
doing
certain
things
and
all
else
they
retained
to
themselves
this
federal
agent
got
just
so
much
as
the
states
chose
to
give
no
more
it
could
do
nothing
save
by
warrant
of
the
authority
of
the
grant
made
by
the
states
therefore
its
powers
are
not
comparable
to
the
powers
of
the
state
legislature
because
one
is
the
creature
of
grant
and
the
other
the
exponent
of
sovereign
power
the
supreme
court
have
covered
the
whole
ground
of
the
relation
of
the
congress
to
the
territorial
legislatures
the
agent
of
the
states
and
the
agent
of
the
congress
and
the
restrictions
put
upon
the
one
are
those
put
upon
the
other
in
language
so
clear
as
to
render
it
needless
further
to
labor
the
subject
in
following
the
promulgation
of
this
notion
of
squatter
sovereignty
we
had
the
idea
of
introduced
into
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
strange
to
me
how
that
idea
has
expanded
it
seems
to
have
been
more
malleable
than
gold
to
have
been
hammered
out
to
an
extent
that
covers
boundless
regions
undiscovered
by
those
who
proclaimed
the
doctrine
then
meant
as
the
debates
show
that
congress
should
neither
prohibit
nor
establish
slavery
in
the
territories
that
i
hold
to
now
will
any
one
suppose
that
congress
then
meant
by
that
congress
should
legislate
in
no
regard
in
respect
to
property
in
slaves
why
sir
the
very
acts
which
they
passed
at
the
time
refute
it
there
is
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
that
abomination
of
laws
which
assumed
to
confiscate
the
property
of
a
citizen
who
should
attempt
to
bring
it
into
this
district
with
intent
to
remove
it
to
sell
it
at
some
other
time
and
at
some
other
place
congress
acted
then
upon
the
subject
acted
beyond
the
limit
of
its
authority
as
i
believed
confidently
believed
and
if
ever
that
act
comes
before
the
supreme
court
i
feel
satisfied
they
will
declare
it
null
and
void
are
we
to
understand
that
those
men
thus
acting
at
the
very
moment
intended
by
to
deny
and
repudiate
the
laws
they
were
then
creating
the
man
who
stood
most
prominently
the
advocate
of
the
measures
of
that
year
who
great
in
many
periods
of
our
history
perhaps
shone
then
with
the
brightest
light
his
genius
ever
emitted
i
refer
to
henry
clay
has
given
his
own
view
on
this
subject
and
i
suppose
he
may
be
considered
as
the
highest
authority
on
june
i
had
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
compromise
bill
providing
and
that
all
laws
or
parts
of
laws
usages
or
customs
preëxisting
in
the
territories
acquired
by
the
united
states
from
mexico
and
which
in
said
territories
restrict
abridge
or
obstruct
the
full
enjoyment
of
any
right
of
person
or
property
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
as
recognized
or
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
are
hereby
declared
and
shall
be
held
as
repealed
upon
that
clay
said
president
i
thought
that
upon
this
subject
there
had
been
a
clear
understanding
in
the
senate
that
the
senate
would
not
decide
itself
upon
the
as
it
respects
slavery
that
the
senate
would
not
allow
the
territorial
legislature
to
pass
any
law
upon
that
question
in
other
words
that
it
would
leave
the
operation
of
the
local
law
or
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
upon
that
local
law
to
be
decided
by
the
proper
and
competent
tribunal
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
congressional
congress
first
session
p
that
was
the
position
taken
by
clay
the
leader
a
mere
sentence
will
show
with
what
view
i
regarded
the
dogma
of
when
that
amendment
was
offered
i
said
but
what
is
seems
to
vary
as
often
as
the
light
and
shade
of
every
fleeting
cloud
it
has
different
meanings
in
every
state
in
every
county
in
every
town
if
means
that
we
shall
not
have
protection
for
our
property
in
slaves
then
i
always
was
and
always
shall
be
opposed
to
it
if
it
means
that
we
shall
not
have
the
protection
of
the
law
because
it
would
favor
slaveholders
that
congress
shall
not
legislate
so
as
to
secure
to
us
the
benefits
of
the
constitution
then
i
am
opposed
to
and
shall
always
be
opposed
to
it
to
congressional
congress
first
session
p
downs
one
of
the
committee
of
thirteen
and
an
advocate
of
the
measures
said
what
i
understand
by
is
an
interposition
of
congress
prohibiting
or
establishing
or
interfering
with
slavery
to
congressional
congress
first
session
p
by
what
species
of
legerdemain
this
doctrine
of
has
come
to
extend
to
a
paralysis
of
the
government
on
the
whole
subject
to
exclude
the
congress
from
any
kind
of
legislation
whatever
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
certain
it
is
it
was
not
the
theory
of
that
period
and
it
was
not
contended
for
in
all
the
controversies
we
had
then
i
had
no
faith
in
it
then
i
considered
it
an
evasion
i
held
that
the
duty
of
congress
ought
to
be
performed
that
the
issue
was
before
us
and
ought
to
be
met
the
sooner
the
better
that
truth
would
prevail
if
presented
to
the
people
borne
down
it
would
rise
up
and
i
stood
then
on
the
same
general
plea
which
i
am
making
now
the
senator
from
illinois
douglas
and
myself
differed
at
that
time
as
i
presume
we
do
now
we
differed
radically
then
he
opposed
every
proposition
which
i
made
voting
against
propositions
to
give
power
to
a
territorial
legislature
to
protect
which
should
be
taken
there
to
remove
the
obstructions
of
the
mexican
laws
voting
for
a
proposition
to
exclude
the
conclusion
that
slavery
might
be
taken
there
voting
for
the
proposition
expressly
to
prohibit
its
introduction
voting
for
the
proposition
to
keep
in
force
the
laws
of
mexico
which
prohibited
it
some
of
these
votes
it
is
but
just
to
him
i
should
say
i
think
he
gave
perforce
of
his
instructions
but
others
of
them
i
think
it
is
equally
fair
to
suppose
were
outside
of
the
limits
of
any
instructions
which
could
have
been
given
before
the
fact
in
advancing
in
this
same
general
line
of
thought
the
congress
in
enacting
territorial
bills
left
out
a
provision
which
had
before
been
usually
contained
in
them
requiring
the
legislature
of
the
territory
to
submit
its
laws
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
has
been
sometimes
assumed
that
this
was
the
recognition
of
the
power
of
the
territorial
legislature
to
exercise
plenary
legislation
as
might
that
of
a
state
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
our
present
form
of
government
was
instituted
there
were
those
who
believed
the
federal
government
should
have
the
power
of
revision
over
the
laws
of
a
state
it
was
long
and
ably
contended
for
in
the
convention
which
formed
the
constitution
and
one
of
the
compromises
which
was
made
was
an
appellate
power
to
lodge
power
in
the
supreme
court
to
decide
all
questions
of
constitutional
law
but
did
this
omission
of
the
obligation
to
send
here
the
laws
of
the
territories
work
this
grant
of
power
to
the
territorial
legislature
certainly
not
it
could
not
and
that
it
did
not
is
evinced
by
the
fact
that
at
a
subsequent
period
the
organic
act
was
revised
because
the
legislation
of
the
territory
of
kansas
was
offensive
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
congress
could
not
abdicate
its
authority
it
could
not
abandon
its
trust
and
when
it
omitted
the
requirement
that
the
laws
should
be
sent
back
it
created
a
which
required
it
to
act
without
the
official
records
being
laid
before
it
as
they
would
have
been
if
the
obligation
had
existed
that
was
all
the
difference
it
was
not
enforcing
upon
the
agent
the
obligation
to
send
the
information
it
left
congress
as
to
its
power
just
where
it
was
i
find
myself
physically
unable
to
go
as
fully
into
the
subject
as
i
intended
and
therefore
omitting
a
reference
to
those
acts
suffice
it
to
say
that
here
was
the
recognition
of
the
obligation
of
congress
to
interpose
against
a
territorial
legislature
for
the
protection
of
personal
right
that
is
what
we
ask
of
congress
now
i
am
not
disposed
to
ask
this
congress
to
go
into
speculative
legislation
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
would
willingly
see
this
congress
enact
a
code
to
be
applied
to
all
territories
and
for
all
time
to
come
i
only
ask
that
cases
as
they
arise
may
be
met
according
to
the
exigency
i
ask
that
when
personal
and
property
rights
in
the
territories
are
not
protected
then
the
congress
by
existing
laws
and
governmental
machinery
shall
intervene
and
provide
such
means
as
will
secure
in
each
case
as
far
as
may
be
an
adequate
remedy
i
ask
no
slave
code
nor
horse
code
nor
machine
code
i
ask
that
the
territorial
legislature
be
made
to
understand
beforehand
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
does
not
concede
to
them
the
power
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
person
or
property
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
that
it
will
apply
the
remedy
if
the
territorial
legislature
should
so
far
forget
its
duty
so
far
transcend
its
power
as
to
commit
that
violation
of
right
that
is
the
announcement
of
the
fifth
resolution
these
are
the
general
views
which
i
entertain
of
our
right
of
protection
and
the
duty
of
the
government
they
are
those
which
are
entertained
by
the
constituency
i
have
the
honor
to
represent
whose
delegation
has
recently
announced
those
principles
at
charleston
i
honor
them
and
i
approve
their
conduct
i
think
their
bearing
was
worthy
of
the
which
sent
them
there
and
i
doubt
not
she
will
receive
them
with
joy
and
gratitude
they
have
asserted
and
vindicated
her
equality
of
right
by
that
asserted
equality
of
right
i
doubt
not
she
will
stand
for
weal
or
for
woe
for
prosperity
or
adversity
for
the
preservation
of
the
great
blessings
which
we
enjoy
or
the
trial
of
a
new
and
separate
condition
i
trust
mississippi
never
will
surrender
the
smallest
atom
of
the
sovereignty
independence
and
equality
to
which
she
was
born
to
avoid
any
danger
or
any
sacrifice
to
which
she
may
hereby
be
exposed
the
sixth
resolution
of
the
series
declares
at
what
time
a
state
may
form
a
constitution
and
decide
upon
her
domestic
institutions
i
deny
this
right
to
the
territorial
condition
because
the
territory
belongs
in
common
to
the
states
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
as
a
joint
owner
of
that
territory
has
a
right
to
go
into
it
with
any
property
which
he
may
possess
these
territorial
inhabitants
require
municipal
law
police
and
government
they
should
have
them
but
they
should
be
restricted
to
their
own
necessities
they
have
no
right
within
their
municipal
power
to
attempt
to
decide
the
rights
of
the
people
of
the
states
they
have
no
right
to
exclude
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
from
owning
and
equally
enjoying
this
common
possession
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
order
and
giving
protection
to
rights
of
person
and
property
that
a
municipal
territorial
government
should
be
instituted
the
last
resolution
refers
to
a
law
founded
on
a
provision
of
the
constitution
which
contains
an
obligation
of
faith
to
every
state
of
the
union
and
that
obligation
of
faith
has
been
violated
by
thirteen
states
of
the
confederacy
as
many
as
originally
fought
the
battles
of
the
revolution
and
established
the
confederation
is
it
to
be
expected
that
a
compact
thus
broken
in
part
violated
in
its
important
features
will
be
regarded
as
binding
in
all
else
is
the
free
trade
which
the
north
sought
in
the
formation
of
the
union
and
for
which
the
states
generally
agreed
to
give
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
to
be
trampled
under
foot
by
laws
of
obstruction
not
giving
to
the
citizens
of
the
south
that
free
transit
across
the
territory
of
the
northern
states
which
we
might
claim
from
any
friendly
state
under
christendom
and
is
congress
to
stand
powerless
by
on
the
doctrine
of
we
have
a
right
to
claim
abstinence
from
interference
with
our
rights
from
any
government
on
the
earth
shall
we
claim
no
more
from
that
which
we
have
constituted
for
our
own
purposes
and
which
we
support
by
draining
our
own
means
for
its
support
we
have
had
agitation
changing
in
its
form
and
gathering
intensity
for
the
last
forty
years
it
was
first
for
political
power
and
directed
against
new
states
now
it
has
assumed
a
social
form
is
and
has
reached
the
point
of
revolution
and
civil
war
for
it
was
only
last
fall
that
an
overt
act
was
committed
by
men
who
were
sustained
by
arms
and
money
raised
by
extensive
combination
among
the
states
to
carry
treasonable
war
against
the
state
of
virginia
because
now
as
before
the
revolution
and
ever
since
she
held
the
african
in
bondage
this
is
part
of
the
history
and
marks
the
necessity
of
the
times
it
warns
us
to
stop
and
reflect
to
go
back
to
the
original
standard
to
measure
our
acts
by
the
obligation
of
our
fathers
by
the
pledges
they
made
one
to
the
other
to
see
whether
we
are
conforming
to
our
plighted
faith
and
to
ask
seriously
solemnly
looking
each
other
inquiringly
in
the
face
what
we
should
do
to
save
our
country
this
agitation
being
at
first
one
of
sectional
pride
for
political
power
has
at
last
degenerated
or
grown
up
to
as
you
please
a
trade
there
are
men
who
habitually
set
aside
a
portion
of
money
which
they
are
annually
to
apply
to
what
are
called
charitable
purposes
that
is
to
say
so
far
as
i
understand
it
to
support
some
vagrant
lecturer
whose
purpose
is
agitation
and
mischief
wherever
he
goes
this
constitutes
therefore
a
trade
a
class
of
people
are
thus
employed
employed
for
mischief
for
incendiary
purposes
perhaps
not
always
understood
by
those
who
furnish
the
money
but
such
is
the
effect
such
is
the
result
of
their
action
and
in
this
state
of
the
case
i
call
upon
the
senate
to
affirm
the
great
principles
on
which
our
institutions
rest
in
no
spirit
of
crimination
have
i
stated
the
reasons
why
i
present
it
for
these
reasons
i
call
upon
them
now
to
restrain
the
growth
of
evil
passion
and
to
bring
back
the
public
sense
as
far
as
in
them
lies
by
earnest
and
united
effort
if
it
may
be
to
crown
our
country
with
peace
and
start
it
once
more
in
its
primal
channel
on
a
career
of
progressive
prosperity
and
justice
the
majority
section
can
not
be
struggling
for
additional
power
in
order
to
preserve
their
rights
if
any
of
them
ever
believed
in
what
is
called
southern
aggression
they
know
now
they
have
the
majority
in
the
representative
districts
and
in
the
electoral
college
they
can
not
therefore
fear
an
invasion
of
their
rights
they
need
no
additional
political
power
to
protect
them
from
that
the
argument
then
or
the
reason
on
which
this
agitation
commenced
has
passed
away
and
yet
we
are
asked
if
a
party
hostile
to
our
institutions
shall
gain
possession
of
the
government
that
we
shall
stand
quietly
by
and
wait
for
an
overt
act
overt
act
is
not
a
declaration
of
war
an
overt
act
what
would
be
thought
of
a
country
that
after
a
declaration
of
war
and
while
the
enemy
fleets
were
upon
the
sea
should
wait
until
a
city
had
been
sacked
before
it
would
say
that
war
existed
or
resistance
should
be
made
the
power
of
resistance
consists
in
no
small
degree
in
meeting
the
evil
at
the
outer
gate
i
can
speak
for
myself
and
i
have
no
right
to
speak
for
others
when
i
say
that
if
i
belonged
to
a
party
organized
on
the
basis
of
making
war
on
any
section
or
interest
in
the
united
states
if
i
know
myself
i
would
instantly
quit
it
we
have
made
no
war
against
you
we
have
asked
no
discrimination
in
our
favor
we
claim
to
have
but
the
constitution
fairly
and
equally
administered
to
consent
to
less
than
this
would
be
to
sink
in
the
scale
of
manhood
would
be
to
make
our
posterity
so
degraded
that
they
would
curse
this
generation
for
robbing
them
of
the
rights
their
revolutionary
fathers
bequeathed
them
among
the
great
purposes
declared
in
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
is
one
to
provide
for
the
general
welfare
provision
for
the
general
welfare
implies
general
fraternity
this
union
was
not
expected
to
be
held
together
by
coercion
the
power
of
force
as
a
means
was
denied
they
sought
however
to
bind
it
perpetually
together
with
that
which
was
stronger
than
triple
bars
of
brass
and
steel
the
ceaseless
current
of
kind
offices
renewing
and
renewed
in
an
eternal
flow
and
gathering
volume
and
velocity
as
it
rolled
it
was
a
function
intended
not
for
the
injury
of
any
it
declared
its
purpose
to
be
the
benefit
of
all
concessions
which
were
made
between
the
different
states
in
the
convention
prove
the
motive
each
gave
to
the
other
what
was
necessary
to
it
what
each
could
afford
to
spare
young
as
a
nation
our
triumphs
under
this
system
have
had
no
parallel
in
human
history
we
have
tamed
a
wilderness
we
have
spanned
a
continent
we
have
built
up
a
granary
that
secures
the
commercial
world
against
the
fear
of
famine
higher
than
all
this
we
have
achieved
a
moral
triumph
we
have
received
by
hundreds
of
thousands
a
constant
tide
of
immigrants
energetic
if
not
well
educated
fleeing
some
from
want
some
from
oppression
some
from
the
penalties
of
violated
law
received
them
into
our
society
and
by
the
gentle
suasion
of
a
government
which
exhibits
no
force
by
removing
want
and
giving
employment
they
have
subsided
into
peaceful
citizens
and
have
increased
the
wealth
and
power
of
our
country
if
then
this
temple
so
blessed
and
to
the
roof
of
which
we
were
about
to
look
to
see
it
extended
over
the
continent
giving
a
protecting
arm
to
infant
republics
that
need
it
if
this
temple
is
tottering
on
its
pillars
what
i
ask
can
be
a
higher
or
nobler
duty
for
the
senate
to
perform
than
to
rush
to
its
pillars
and
uphold
them
or
be
crushed
in
the
attempt
we
have
tampered
with
a
question
which
has
grown
in
magnitude
by
each
year
delay
it
requires
to
be
plainly
met
the
truth
to
be
told
the
patriotism
and
the
sound
sense
of
the
people
whenever
the
federal
government
from
its
high
places
of
authority
shall
proclaim
the
truth
in
unequivocal
language
will
in
my
firm
belief
receive
and
approve
it
but
so
long
as
we
deal
like
the
delphic
oracle
in
words
of
double
meaning
so
long
as
we
attempt
to
escape
from
responsibility
and
exhibit
our
fear
to
declare
the
truth
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
act
upon
it
we
must
expect
speculative
theory
to
occupy
the
mind
of
the
public
and
error
to
increase
as
time
rolls
on
but
if
the
sad
fate
should
be
ours
for
this
most
minute
cause
to
destroy
our
government
the
historian
who
shall
attempt
philosophically
to
examine
the
question
will
after
he
has
put
on
his
microscopic
glasses
and
discovered
it
be
compelled
to
cry
out
veritably
so
the
unseen
insect
in
the
course
of
time
destroys
the
mighty
oak
now
i
believe
may
i
not
say
i
believe
if
not
then
i
hope
there
is
yet
time
by
the
full
explicit
declaration
of
the
truth
to
disabuse
the
popular
mind
to
arouse
the
popular
heart
to
expose
the
danger
from
lurking
treason
and
hostility
to
rally
a
virtuous
people
to
their
rescue
who
circling
closer
and
deeper
as
the
storm
gathers
fury
around
the
ark
of
their
fathers
covenant
will
place
it
in
security
there
happily
to
remain
a
sign
of
fraternity
justice
and
equality
to
our
remotest
posterity

proper

in

for

and

between
this

and

in
the
execution
of
this
trust
it
is
our

to
furnish
you
as
we
now
do
with
an
official
copy
of
the
ordinance
of
secession
by
which
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
resumed
the
powers
she
delegated
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
has
declared
her
perfect
sovereignty
and
independence
it
would
also
have
been
our
duty
to
have
informed
you
that
we
were
ready
to
negotiate
with
you
upon
all
such
questions
as
are
necessarily
raised
by
the
adoption
of
this
ordinance
and
that
we
were
prepared
to
enter
upon
this
negotiation
with
the
earnest
desire
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
and
hostile
collision
and
so
to
inaugurate
our
new
relations
as
to
secure
mutual
respect
general
advantage
and
a
future
of
and
harmony
beneficial
to
all
the
parties
concerned
but
the
events
of
the
last
hours
render
such
an
assurance
impossible
we
came
here
the
representatives
of
an
authority
which
could
at
any
time
within
the
past
sixty
days
have
taken
possession
of
the
forts
in
charleston
harbor
but
which
upon
pledges
given
in
a
manner
that
we
can
not
doubt
determined
to
trust
to
your
honor
rather
than
to
its
own
power
since
our
arrival
here
an
officer
of
the
united
states
acting
as
we
are
assured
not
only
without
but
against
your
orders
has
dismantled
one
fort
and
occupied
another
thus
altering
to
a
most
important
extent
the
condition
of
affairs
under
which
we
came
until
these
circumstances
are
explained
in
a
manner
which
relieves
us
of
all
doubt
as
to
the
spirit
in
which
these
negotiations
shall
be
conducted
we
are
forced
to
suspend
all
discussion
as
to
any
arrangements
by
which
our
mutual
interests
might
be
amicably
adjusted
and
in
conclusion
we
would
urge
upon
you
the
immediate
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
under
present
circumstances
they
are
a
standing
menace
which
renders
negotiation
impossible
and
as
our
recent
experience
shows
threatens
speedily
to
bring
to
a
bloody
issue
questions
which
ought
to
be
settled
with
temperance
and
judgment
we
have
the
honor
sir
to
be
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servants
barnwell
adams
james
orr
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
the
president
to
the
washington
city
gentlemen
i
have
the
honor
to
receive
your
communication
of
together
with
a
copy
of
your
full
powers
from
the
convention
of
the
people
of
south
carolina
authorizing
you
to
treat
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
various
important
subjects
therein
mentioned
and
also
a
copy
of
the
ordinance
bearing
date
on
the
declaring
that
the
union
now
subsisting
between
south
carolina
and
other
states
under
the
name
of
united
states
of
america
is
hereby
dissolved
in
answer
to
this
communication
i
have
to
say
that
my
position
as
president
of
the
united
states
was
clearly
defined
in
the
message
to
congress
of
the
instant
in
that
i
stated
that
apart
from
the
execution
of
the
laws
so
far
as
this
may
be
practicable
the
executive
has
no
authority
to
decide
what
shall
be
the
relations
between
the
federal
government
and
south
carolina
he
has
been
invested
with
no
such
discretion
he
possesses
no
power
to
change
the
relations
heretofore
existing
between
them
much
less
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
that
state
this
would
be
to
invest
a
mere
executive
officer
with
the
power
of
recognizing
the
dissolution
of
the
confederacy
among
our
sovereign
states
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
recognition
of
a
foreign
government
involving
no
such
responsibility
any
attempt
to
do
this
would
on
his
part
be
a
naked
act
of
usurpation
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
submit
to
congress
the
whole
question
in
all
its
bearings
such
is
my
opinion
still
i
could
therefore
meet
you
only
as
private
gentlemen
of
the
highest
character
and
was
entirely
willing
to
communicate
to
congress
any
proposition
you
might
have
to
make
to
that
body
upon
the
subject
of
this
you
were
well
aware
it
was
my
earnest
desire
that
such
a
disposition
might
be
made
of
the
whole
subject
by
congress
who
alone
possess
the
power
as
to
prevent
the
inauguration
of
a
civil
war
between
the
parties
in
regard
to
the
possession
of
the
federal
forts
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
i
therefore
deeply
regret
that
in
your
opinion
the
events
of
the
last
hours
render
this
impossible
in
conclusion
you
urge
upon
me
the
immediate
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
stating
that
under
present
circumstances
they
are
a
standing
menace
which
renders
negotiation
impossible
and
as
our
present
experience
shows
threatens
speedily
to
bring
to
a
bloody
issue
questions
which
ought
to
be
settled
with
temperance
and
judgment
the
reason
for
this
change
in
your
position
is
that
since
your
arrival
in
washington
an
officer
of
the
united
states
acting
as
we
you
are
assured
not
only
without
your
my
orders
has
dismantled
one
fort
and
occupied
another
thus
altering
to
a
most
important
extent
the
condition
of
affairs
under
which
we
you
came
you
also
allege
that
you
came
here
the
representatives
of
an
authority
which
could
at
any
time
within
the
past
sixty
days
have
taken
possession
of
the
forts
in
charleston
harbor
but
which
upon
pledges
given
in
a
manner
that
we
you
can
not
doubt
determined
to
trust
to
your
my
honor
rather
than
to
its
own
power
this
brings
me
to
a
consideration
of
the
nature
of
those
alleged
pledges
and
in
what
manner
they
have
been
observed
in
my
message
of
the
of
december
last
i
stated
in
regard
to
the
property
of
the
united
states
in
south
carolina
that
it
has
been
purchased
for
a
fair
equivalent
the
consent
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
for
the
erection
of
forts
magazines
arsenals
and
over
these
the
authority
exercise
exclusive
legislation
has
been
expressly
granted
by
the
constitution
to
congress
it
is
not
believed
that
any
attempt
will
be
made
to
expel
the
united
states
from
this
property
by
force
but
if
in
this
i
should
prove
to
be
mistaken
the
officer
in
command
of
the
forts
has
received
orders
to
act
strictly
on
the
defensive
in
such
a
contingency
the
responsibility
for
consequences
would
rightfully
rest
upon
the
heads
of
the
assailants
this
being
the
condition
of
the
parties
on
saturday
december
four
of
the
representatives
from
south
carolina
called
upon
me
and
requested
an
interview
we
had
an
earnest
conversation
on
the
subject
of
these
forts
and
the
best
means
of
preventing
a
collision
between
the
parties
for
the
purpose
of
sparing
the
effusion
of
blood
i
suggested
for
prudential
reasons
that
it
would
be
best
to
put
in
writing
what
they
said
to
me
verbally
they
did
so
accordingly
and
on
monday
morning
the
instant
three
of
them
presented
to
me
a
paper
signed
by
all
the
representatives
from
south
carolina
with
a
single
exception
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy
to
his
excellency
james
buchanan
of
the
united
in
compliance
with
our
statement
to
you
yesterday
we
now
express
to
you
our
strong
convictions
that
neither
the
constituted
authorities
nor
any
body
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
will
either
attack
or
molest
the
united
states
forts
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
previously
to
the
action
of
the
convention
and
we
hope
and
believe
not
until
an
offer
has
been
made
through
an
accredited
representative
to
negotiate
for
an
amicable
arrangement
of
all
matters
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
provided
that
no
reënforcements
shall
be
sent
into
those
forts
and
their
relative
military
shall
remain
as
at
present
john
mcqueen
william
porcher
miles
bonham
boyce
lawrence
keitt
washington
and
here
i
must
in
justice
to
myself
remark
that
at
the
time
the
paper
was
presented
to
me
i
objected
to
the
word
provided
as
it
might
be
construed
into
an
agreement
on
my
part
which
i
never
would
make
they
said
that
nothing
was
further
from
their
intention
they
did
not
so
understand
it
and
i
should
not
so
consider
it
it
is
evident
they
could
enter
into
no
reciprocal
agreement
with
me
on
the
subject
they
did
not
profess
to
have
authority
to
do
this
and
were
acting
in
their
individual
character
i
considered
it
as
nothing
more
in
effect
than
the
promise
of
highly
honorable
gentlemen
to
exert
their
influence
for
the
purpose
expressed
the
event
has
proved
that
they
have
faithfully
kept
this
promise
although
i
have
never
since
received
a
line
from
any
one
of
them
or
from
any
member
of
the
convention
on
the
subject
it
is
well
known
that
it
was
my
determination
and
this
i
freely
expressed
not
to
reënforce
the
forts
in
the
harbor
and
thus
produce
a
collision
until
they
had
been
actually
attacked
or
until
i
had
certain
evidence
that
they
were
about
to
be
attacked
this
paper
i
received
most
cordially
and
considered
it
as
a
happy
omen
that
peace
might
still
be
preserved
and
that
time
might
thus
be
gained
for
reflection
this
is
the
whole
foundation
for
the
alleged
pledge
but
i
acted
in
the
same
manner
i
would
have
done
had
i
entered
into
a
positive
and
formal
agreement
with
parties
capable
of
contracting
although
such
an
agreement
would
have
been
on
my
part
from
the
nature
of
my
official
duties
impossible
the
world
knows
that
i
have
never
sent
any
reënforcements
to
the
forts
in
charleston
harbor
and
i
have
certainly
never
authorized
any
change
to
be
made
in
their
relative
military
bearing
upon
this
subject
i
refer
you
to
an
order
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
instant
to
major
anderson
but
not
brought
to
my
notice
until
the
instant
it
is
as
follows
of
verbal
instructions
to
anderson
artillery
commanding
fort
moultrie
south
you
are
aware
of
the
great
anxiety
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
a
collision
of
the
troops
with
the
people
of
this
state
shall
be
avoided
and
of
his
studied
determination
to
pursue
a
course
with
reference
to
the
military
force
and
forts
in
this
harbor
which
shall
guard
against
such
a
collision
he
has
therefore
carefully
abstained
from
increasing
the
force
at
this
point
or
taking
any
measures
which
might
add
to
the
present
excited
state
of
the
public
mind
or
which
would
throw
any
doubt
on
the
confidence
he
feels
that
south
carolina
will
not
attempt
by
violence
to
obtain
possession
of
the
public
works
or
to
interfere
with
their
occupancy
but
as
the
counsel
of
rash
and
impulsive
persons
may
possibly
disappoint
these
expectations
of
the
government
he
deems
it
proper
that
you
should
be
prepared
with
instructions
to
meet
so
unhappy
a
contingency
he
has
therefore
directed
me
verbally
to
give
you
such
instructions
you
are
carefully
to
avoid
every
act
which
would
needlessly
tend
to
provoke
aggression
and
for
that
reason
you
are
not
without
evident
and
imminent
necessity
to
take
up
any
position
which
could
be
construed
into
the
assumption
of
a
hostile
attitude
but
you
are
to
hold
possession
of
the
forts
in
this
harbor
and
if
attacked
you
are
to
defend
yourself
to
the
last
extremity
the
smallness
of
your
force
will
not
permit
you
perhaps
to
occupy
more
than
one
of
the
three
forts
but
an
attack
on
or
attempt
to
take
possession
of
either
of
them
will
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
hostility
and
you
may
then
put
your
command
into
either
of
them
which
you
may
deem
most
proper
to
increase
its
power
of
resistance
you
are
also
authorized
to
take
similar
defensive
steps
whenever
you
have
tangible
evidence
of
a
design
to
proceed
to
a
hostile
act
butler
fort
moultrie
south
carolina
this
is
in
conformity
to
my
instructions
to
major
buel
john
floyd
of
these
were
the
last
instructions
transmitted
to
major
anderson
before
his
removal
to
fort
sumter
with
a
single
exception
in
regard
to
a
particular
which
does
not
in
any
degree
affect
the
present
question
under
these
circumstances
it
is
clear
that
major
anderson
acted
upon
his
own
responsibility
and
without
authority
unless
indeed
he
had
tangible
evidence
of
a
design
to
proceed
to
a
hostile
act
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
which
has
not
yet
been
alleged
still
he
is
a
brave
and
honorable
officer
and
justice
requires
that
he
should
not
be
condemned
without
a
fair
hearing
be
this
as
it
may
when
i
learned
that
major
anderson
had
left
fort
moultrie
and
proceeded
to
fort
sumter
my
first
promptings
were
to
command
him
to
return
to
his
former
position
and
there
to
await
the
contingencies
presented
in
his
instructions
this
could
only
have
been
done
with
any
degree
of
safety
to
the
command
by
the
concurrence
of
the
south
carolina
authorities
but
before
any
steps
could
possibly
have
been
taken
in
this
direction
we
received
information
dated
on
the
instant
that
the
palmetto
flag
floated
out
to
the
breeze
at
castle
pinckney
and
a
large
military
force
went
over
last
night
the
to
fort
moultrie
thus
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
without
waiting
or
asking
for
any
explanation
and
doubtless
believing
as
you
have
expressed
it
that
the
officer
had
acted
not
only
without
but
against
my
orders
on
the
very
next
day
after
the
night
when
the
removal
was
made
seized
by
a
military
force
two
of
the
three
federal
forts
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
have
covered
them
under
their
own
flag
instead
of
that
of
the
united
states
at
this
gloomy
period
of
our
history
startling
events
succeed
each
other
rapidly
on
the
very
day
the
instant
that
possession
of
these
two
forts
was
taken
the
palmetto
flag
was
raised
over
the
federal
and
in
charleston
and
on
the
same
day
every
officer
of
the
customs
collector
naval
officers
surveyor
and
appraisers
resigned
their
offices
and
this
although
it
was
well
known
from
the
language
of
my
message
that
as
an
executive
officer
i
felt
myself
bound
to
collect
the
revenue
at
the
port
of
charleston
under
the
existing
laws
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
we
now
find
three
forts
confronting
each
other
over
all
of
which
the
federal
flag
floated
only
four
days
ago
but
now
over
two
of
them
this
flag
has
been
supplanted
and
the
palmetto
flag
has
been
substituted
in
its
stead
it
is
under
all
these
circumstances
that
i
am
urged
immediately
to
withdraw
the
troops
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
am
informed
that
without
this
negotiation
is
impossible
this
i
can
not
do
this
i
will
not
do
such
an
idea
was
never
thought
of
by
me
in
any
possible
contingency
no
allusion
to
it
had
ever
been
made
in
any
communication
between
myself
and
any
human
being
but
the
inference
is
that
i
am
bound
to
withdraw
the
troops
from
the
only
fort
remaining
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
because
the
officer
then
in
command
of
all
the
forts
thought
proper
without
instructions
to
change
his
position
from
one
of
them
to
another
i
can
not
admit
the
justice
of
any
such
inference
at
this
point
of
writing
i
have
received
information
by
telegram
from
captain
humphreys
in
command
of
the
arsenal
at
charleston
that
it
has
sunday
the
been
taken
by
force
of
arms
it
is
estimated
that
the
munitions
of
war
belonging
to
the
united
states
in
this
arsenal
are
worth
half
a
million
of
dollars
comment
is
needless
after
this
information
i
have
only
to
add
that
while
it
is
my
duty
to
defend
fort
sumter
as
a
portion
of
the
public
property
of
the
united
states
against
hostile
attacks
from
whatever
quarter
they
may
come
by
such
means
as
i
may
possess
for
this
purpose
i
do
not
perceive
how
such
a
defense
can
be
construed
into
a
menace
against
the
city
of
charleston
with
great
personal
regard
i
remain
yours
very
respectfully
james
buchanan
to
honorable
robert
barnwell
james
adams
james
orr
of
the
commissioners
to
the
washington
sir
we
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
of
the
december
in
reply
to
a
note
addressed
by
us
to
you
on
the
of
the
same
month
as
commissioners
from
south
carolina
in
reference
to
the
declaration
with
which
your
reply
commences
that
your
position
as
president
of
the
united
states
was
clearly
defined
in
the
message
to
congress
of
the
instant
that
you
possess
no
power
to
change
the
relations
heretofore
existing
between
south
carolina
and
the
united
states
much
less
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
that
state
and
that
consequently
you
could
meet
us
only
as
private
gentlemen
of
the
highest
character
with
an
entire
willingness
to
communicate
to
congress
any
proposition
we
might
have
to
make
we
deem
it
only
necessary
to
say
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
having
in
the
exercise
of
that
great
right
of
which
underlies
all
our
political
organizations
declared
herself
sovereign
and
independent
we
as
her
representatives
felt
no
special
solicitude
as
to
the
character
in
which
you
might
recognize
us
satisfied
that
the
state
had
simply
exercised
her
unquestionable
right
we
were
prepared
in
order
to
reach
substantial
good
to
waive
the
formal
considerations
which
your
constitutional
scruples
might
have
prevented
you
from
extending
we
came
here
therefore
expecting
to
be
received
as
you
did
receive
us
and
perfectly
content
with
that
entire
willingness
of
which
you
assured
us
to
submit
any
proposition
to
congress
which
we
might
have
to
make
upon
the
subject
of
the
independence
of
the
state
that
willingness
was
ample
recognition
of
the
condition
of
public
affairs
which
rendered
our
presence
necessary
in
this
position
however
it
is
our
duty
both
to
the
state
which
we
represent
and
to
ourselves
to
correct
several
important
misconceptions
of
our
letter
into
which
you
have
fallen
you
say
it
was
my
earnest
desire
that
such
a
disposition
might
be
made
of
the
whole
subject
by
congress
who
alone
possesses
the
power
to
prevent
the
inauguration
of
a
civil
war
between
the
parties
in
regard
to
the
possession
of
the
federal
forts
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
i
therefore
deeply
regret
that
in
your
opinion
events
of
the
last
hours
render
this
impossible
we
expressed
no
such
opinion
and
the
language
which
you
quote
as
ours
is
altered
in
its
sense
by
the
omission
of
a
most
important
part
of
the
sentence
what
we
did
say
was
but
the
events
of
the
last
hours
render
an
impossible
place
that
assurance
as
contained
in
our
letter
in
the
sentence
and
we
are
prepared
to
repeat
it
again
professing
to
quote
our
language
you
say
thus
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
without
waiting
or
asking
for
any
explanation
and
doubtless
believing
as
you
have
expressed
it
that
the
officer
had
acted
not
only
without
but
against
my
orders
etc
we
expressed
no
such
opinion
in
reference
to
the
belief
of
the
people
of
south
carolina
the
language
which
you
have
quoted
was
applied
solely
and
entirely
to
obtained
here
and
based
as
you
well
know
upon
your
own
declaration
a
declaration
which
at
that
time
it
was
impossible
for
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
to
have
known
but
without
following
this
letter
into
all
its
details
we
propose
only
to
meet
the
chief
points
of
the
argument
some
weeks
ago
the
state
of
south
carolina
declared
her
intention
in
the
existing
condition
of
public
affairs
to
secede
from
the
united
states
she
called
a
convention
of
her
people
to
put
her
declaration
in
force
the
convention
met
and
passed
the
ordinance
of
secession
all
this
you
anticipated
and
your
course
of
action
was
thoroughly
considered
in
your
annual
message
you
declared
that
you
had
no
right
and
would
not
attempt
to
coerce
a
seceding
state
but
that
you
were
bound
by
your
constitutional
oath
and
would
defend
the
property
of
the
united
states
within
the
borders
of
south
carolina
if
an
attempt
was
made
to
take
it
by
force
seeing
very
early
that
this
question
of
property
was
a
difficult
and
delicate
one
you
manifested
a
desire
to
settle
it
without
collision
you
did
not
reënforce
the
garrisons
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
you
removed
a
distinguished
and
veteran
officer
from
the
command
of
fort
moultrie
because
he
attempted
to
increase
his
supply
of
ammunition
you
refused
to
send
additional
troops
to
the
same
garrison
when
applied
for
by
the
officer
appointed
to
succeed
him
you
accepted
the
resignation
of
the
oldest
and
most
eminent
member
of
your
cabinet
rather
than
allow
these
garrisons
to
be
strengthened
you
compelled
an
officer
stationed
at
fort
sumter
to
return
immediately
to
the
arsenal
forty
muskets
which
he
had
taken
to
arm
his
men
you
expressed
not
to
one
but
to
many
of
the
most
distinguished
of
our
public
characters
whose
testimony
will
be
placed
upon
the
record
whenever
it
is
necessary
your
anxiety
for
a
peaceful
termination
of
this
controversy
and
your
willingness
not
to
disturb
the
military
of
the
forts
if
commissioners
should
be
sent
to
the
government
whose
communications
you
promised
to
submit
to
congress
you
received
and
acted
on
assurances
from
the
highest
official
authorities
of
south
carolina
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
disturb
your
possession
of
the
forts
and
property
of
the
united
states
if
you
would
not
disturb
their
existing
condition
until
commissioners
had
been
sent
and
the
attempt
to
negotiate
had
failed
you
took
from
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
a
written
memorandum
that
no
such
attempt
should
be
made
provided
that
no
reënforcements
shall
be
sent
into
those
forts
and
their
relative
military
shall
remain
as
at
present
and
although
you
attach
no
force
to
the
acceptance
of
such
a
paper
although
you
considered
it
as
nothing
more
in
effect
than
the
promise
of
highly
honorable
gentlemen
as
an
obligation
on
one
side
without
corresponding
obligation
on
the
other
it
must
be
remembered
if
we
are
rightly
informed
that
you
were
pledged
if
you
ever
did
send
reënforcements
to
return
it
to
those
from
whom
you
had
received
it
before
you
executed
your
resolution
you
sent
orders
to
your
officers
commanding
them
strictly
to
follow
a
line
of
conduct
in
conformity
with
such
an
understanding
besides
all
this
you
had
received
formal
and
official
notice
from
the
governor
of
south
carolina
that
we
had
been
appointed
commissioners
and
were
on
our
way
to
washington
you
knew
the
implied
condition
under
which
we
came
our
arrival
was
notified
to
you
and
an
hour
appointed
for
an
interview
we
arrived
in
washington
on
wednesday
at
three
and
you
appointed
an
interview
with
us
at
one
the
next
day
early
on
that
day
thursday
the
news
was
received
here
of
the
movement
of
major
anderson
that
news
was
communicated
to
you
immediately
and
you
postponed
our
meeting
until
two
on
friday
in
order
that
you
might
consult
your
cabinet
on
friday
we
saw
you
and
we
called
upon
you
then
to
redeem
your
pledge
you
could
not
deny
it
with
the
facts
we
have
stated
and
in
the
face
of
the
crowning
and
conclusive
fact
that
your
secretary
of
war
had
resigned
his
seat
in
the
cabinet
upon
the
publicly
avowed
ground
that
the
action
of
major
anderson
had
violated
the
pledged
faith
of
the
government
and
that
unless
the
pledge
was
instantly
redeemed
he
was
dishonored
denial
was
impossible
you
did
not
deny
it
you
do
not
deny
it
now
but
you
seek
to
escape
from
its
obligations
on
two
grounds
that
terminated
all
negotiation
by
demanding
as
a
preliminary
the
withdrawal
of
the
united
states
troops
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
that
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
instead
of
asking
explanation
and
giving
you
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
yourself
took
possession
of
other
property
of
the
united
states
we
will
examine
both
in
the
first
place
we
deny
positively
that
we
have
ever
in
any
way
made
any
such
demand
our
letter
is
in
your
possession
it
will
stand
by
this
on
the
record
in
it
we
inform
you
of
the
objects
of
our
mission
we
say
that
it
would
have
been
our
duty
to
assure
you
of
our
readiness
to
commence
negotiations
with
the
most
earnest
and
anxious
desire
to
settle
all
questions
between
us
amicably
and
to
our
mutual
advantage
but
that
events
had
rendered
that
assurance
impossible
we
stated
the
events
and
we
said
that
until
some
satisfactory
explanation
of
these
events
was
given
us
we
could
not
proceed
and
then
having
made
this
request
for
explanation
we
added
and
in
conclusion
we
would
urge
upon
you
the
immediate
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
the
harbor
of
charleston
under
present
circumstances
they
are
a
standing
menace
which
renders
negotiation
impossible
etc
under
present
circumstances
what
circumstances
why
clearly
the
occupation
of
fort
sumter
and
the
dismantling
of
fort
moultrie
by
major
anderson
in
the
face
of
your
pledges
and
without
explanation
or
practical
disavowal
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
letter
which
would
or
could
have
prevented
you
from
declining
to
withdraw
the
troops
and
offering
the
restoration
of
the
to
which
you
were
pledged
if
such
had
been
your
desire
it
would
have
been
wiser
and
better
in
our
opinion
to
have
withdrawn
the
troops
and
this
opinion
we
urged
upon
you
but
we
nothing
but
such
an
explanation
of
the
events
of
the
last
hours
as
would
restore
our
confidence
in
the
spirit
with
which
the
negotiation
should
be
conducted
in
relation
to
this
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
the
harbor
we
are
compelled
however
to
notice
one
passage
of
your
letter
referring
to
it
you
say
this
i
can
not
do
this
i
will
not
do
such
an
idea
was
never
thought
of
by
me
in
any
possible
contingency
no
allusion
to
it
had
ever
been
made
in
any
communication
between
myself
and
any
human
being
in
reply
to
this
statement
we
are
compelled
to
say
that
your
conversation
with
us
left
upon
our
minds
the
distinct
impression
that
you
did
seriously
contemplate
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
charleston
harbor
and
in
support
of
this
impression
we
would
add
that
we
have
the
positive
assurance
of
gentlemen
of
the
highest
possible
public
reputation
and
the
most
unsullied
integrity
men
whose
name
and
fame
secured
by
long
service
and
patriotic
achievement
place
their
testimony
beyond
cavil
that
such
suggestions
had
been
made
to
and
urged
upon
you
by
them
and
had
formed
the
subject
of
more
than
one
earnest
discussion
with
you
and
it
was
this
knowledge
that
induced
us
to
urge
upon
you
a
policy
which
had
to
recommend
it
its
own
wisdom
and
the
weight
of
such
authority
as
to
the
second
point
that
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
instead
of
asking
explanations
and
giving
you
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
yourself
took
possession
of
other
property
of
the
united
states
we
would
observe
first
that
even
if
this
were
so
it
does
not
avail
you
for
defense
for
the
opportunity
for
decision
was
afforded
you
before
these
facts
occurred
we
arrived
in
washington
on
wednesday
the
news
from
major
anderson
reached
here
early
on
thursday
and
was
immediately
communicated
to
you
all
that
day
men
of
the
highest
consideration
men
who
had
striven
successfully
to
lift
you
to
your
great
office
who
had
been
your
tried
and
true
friends
through
the
troubles
of
your
administration
sought
you
and
entreated
you
to
act
to
act
at
once
they
told
you
that
every
hour
complicated
your
position
they
only
asked
you
to
give
the
assurance
that
if
the
facts
were
so
if
the
commander
had
acted
without
and
against
your
orders
and
in
violation
of
your
pledges
you
would
restore
the
you
had
pledged
your
honor
to
maintain
you
refused
to
decide
your
secretary
of
war
your
immediate
and
proper
adviser
in
this
whole
matter
waited
anxiously
for
your
decision
until
he
felt
that
delay
was
becoming
dishonor
more
than
twelve
hours
passed
and
two
cabinet
meetings
had
adjourned
before
you
knew
what
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
had
done
and
your
prompt
decision
at
any
moment
of
that
time
would
have
avoided
the
subsequent
complications
but
if
you
had
known
the
acts
of
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
should
that
have
prevented
your
keeping
your
faith
what
was
the
condition
of
things
for
the
last
sixty
days
you
have
had
in
charleston
harbor
not
force
enough
to
hold
the
forts
against
an
equal
enemy
two
of
them
were
empty
one
of
those
two
the
most
important
in
the
harbor
it
could
have
been
taken
at
any
time
you
ought
to
know
better
than
any
man
that
it
would
have
been
taken
but
for
the
efforts
of
those
who
put
their
trust
in
your
honor
believing
that
they
were
threatened
by
fort
sumter
especially
the
people
were
with
difficulty
restrained
from
securing
without
blood
the
possession
of
this
important
fortress
after
many
and
reiterated
assurances
given
on
your
behalf
which
we
can
not
believe
unauthorized
they
determined
to
forbear
and
in
good
faith
sent
on
their
commissioners
to
negotiate
with
you
they
meant
you
no
harm
wished
you
no
ill
they
thought
of
you
kindly
believed
you
true
and
were
willing
as
far
as
was
consistent
with
duty
to
spare
you
unnecessary
and
hostile
collision
scarcely
had
their
commissioners
left
than
major
anderson
waged
war
no
other
words
will
describe
his
action
it
was
not
a
peaceful
change
from
one
fort
to
another
it
was
a
hostile
act
in
the
highest
sense
one
only
justified
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
enemy
and
in
imminent
peril
he
abandoned
his
position
spiked
his
guns
burned
his
made
preparations
for
the
destruction
of
his
post
and
withdrew
under
cover
of
the
night
to
a
safer
position
this
was
war
no
man
could
have
believed
without
your
assurance
that
any
officer
could
have
taken
such
a
step
not
only
without
orders
but
against
orders
what
the
state
did
was
in
simple
for
this
act
with
all
its
attending
circumstances
was
as
much
war
as
firing
a
volley
and
war
being
thus
begun
until
those
commencing
it
explained
their
action
and
disavowed
their
intention
there
was
no
room
for
delay
and
even
at
this
moment
while
we
are
writing
it
is
more
than
probable
from
the
tenor
of
your
letter
that
reënforcements
are
hurrying
on
to
the
conflict
so
that
when
the
first
gun
shall
be
fired
there
will
have
been
on
your
part
one
continuous
consistent
series
of
actions
commencing
in
a
demonstration
essentially
warlike
supported
by
regular
reënforcement
and
terminating
in
defeat
or
victory
and
all
this
without
the
slightest
provocation
for
among
the
many
things
which
you
have
said
there
is
one
thing
you
can
not
say
you
have
waited
anxiously
for
news
from
the
seat
of
war
in
hopes
that
delay
would
furnish
some
excuse
for
this
precipitation
but
this
tangible
evidence
of
a
design
to
proceed
to
a
hostile
act
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
which
is
the
only
justification
of
major
anderson
you
are
forced
to
admit
has
not
been
alleged
but
you
have
decided
you
have
resolved
to
hold
by
force
what
you
have
obtained
through
our
misplaced
confidence
and
by
refusing
to
disavow
the
action
of
major
anderson
have
converted
his
violation
of
orders
into
a
legitimate
act
of
your
executive
authority
be
the
issue
what
it
may
of
this
we
are
assured
that
if
fort
moultrie
has
been
recorded
in
history
as
a
memorial
of
carolina
gallantry
fort
sumter
will
live
upon
the
succeeding
page
as
an
imperishable
testimony
of
carolina
faith
by
your
course
you
have
probably
rendered
civil
war
inevitable
be
it
so
if
you
choose
to
force
this
issue
upon
us
the
state
of
south
carolina
will
accept
it
and
relying
upon
him
who
is
the
god
of
justice
as
well
as
the
god
of
hosts
will
endeavor
to
perform
the
great
duty
which
lies
before
her
hopefully
bravely
and
thoroughly
our
mission
being
one
for
negotiation
and
peace
and
your
note
leaving
us
without
hope
of
a
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
fort
sumter
or
of
the
restoration
of
the
existing
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
and
intimating
as
we
think
your
determination
to
reënforce
the
garrison
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
we
respectfully
inform
you
that
we
propose
returning
to
charleston
on
afternoon
we
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servants
barnwell
adams
james
orr
to
his
excellency
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
last
communication
is
endorsed
as
follows
executive
mansion
this
paper
just
presented
to
the
president
is
of
such
a
character
that
he
declines
to
receive
it
appendix
speech
on
the
state
of
the
country
by
davis
of
mississippi
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
january
a
motion
to
print
the
special
message
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
january
being
under
consideration
davis
president
when
i
took
the
floor
yesterday
i
intended
to
engage
somewhat
in
the
argument
which
has
heretofore
prevailed
in
the
senate
upon
the
great
questions
of
constitutional
right
which
have
divided
the
country
from
the
beginning
of
the
government
i
intended
to
adduce
some
evidences
which
i
thought
were
conclusive
in
favor
of
the
opinions
which
i
entertain
but
events
with
a
current
hurrying
on
as
it
progresses
have
borne
me
past
the
point
where
it
would
be
useful
for
me
to
argue
by
the
citing
of
authorities
the
question
of
rights
therefore
it
is
my
purpose
to
deal
with
events
abstract
argument
has
become
among
the
things
that
are
past
we
have
to
deal
now
with
facts
and
in
order
that
we
may
meet
those
facts
and
apply
them
to
our
present
condition
it
is
well
to
inquire
what
is
the
state
of
the
country
the
constitution
provides
that
the
president
shall
from
time
to
time
communicate
information
on
the
state
of
the
union
the
message
which
is
now
under
consideration
gives
us
very
little
indeed
beyond
that
which
the
world
less
indeed
than
reading
men
generally
knew
before
it
was
communicated
what
senators
is
the
condition
of
the
country
from
every
corner
of
it
comes
the
wailing
cry
of
patriotism
pleading
for
the
preservation
of
the
great
inheritance
we
derived
from
our
fathers
is
there
a
senator
who
does
not
daily
receive
letters
appealing
to
him
to
use
even
the
small
power
which
one
man
here
possesses
to
save
the
rich
inheritance
our
fathers
gave
us
tears
are
trickling
down
the
stern
faces
of
men
who
have
bled
for
the
flag
of
their
country
and
are
willing
now
to
die
for
it
but
patriotism
stands
powerless
before
the
plea
that
the
party
about
to
come
into
power
laid
down
a
platform
and
that
come
what
will
though
ruin
stare
us
in
the
face
consistency
must
be
adhered
to
even
though
the
government
be
lost
in
this
state
of
the
case
then
we
turn
and
ask
what
is
the
character
of
the
administration
what
is
the
executive
department
doing
what
assurance
have
we
there
for
the
safety
of
the
country
but
we
come
back
from
that
inquiry
with
a
mournful
conviction
that
feeble
hands
now
hold
the
reins
of
state
that
drivelers
are
taken
in
as
counselors
not
provided
by
the
constitution
that
vacillation
is
the
law
and
the
policy
of
this
great
government
is
changed
with
every
changing
rumor
of
the
day
nay
more
it
is
changing
with
every
new
phase
of
causeless
fear
in
this
state
of
the
case
after
complications
have
been
introduced
into
the
question
after
we
were
brought
to
the
verge
of
war
after
we
were
hourly
expecting
by
telegraph
to
learn
that
the
conflict
had
commenced
after
nothing
had
been
done
to
insure
the
peace
of
the
land
we
are
told
in
this
last
hour
that
the
question
is
thrown
at
the
door
of
congress
and
here
rests
the
responsibility
had
the
garrison
at
charleston
representing
the
claim
of
the
government
to
hold
the
property
in
a
fort
there
been
called
away
thirty
days
nay
ten
days
ago
peace
would
have
spread
its
pinions
over
this
land
and
calm
negotiation
would
have
been
the
order
of
the
day
why
was
it
not
recalled
no
reason
yet
has
been
offered
save
that
the
government
is
bound
to
preserve
its
property
and
yet
look
from
north
to
south
from
east
to
west
wherever
we
have
constructed
forts
to
defend
states
against
a
foreign
foe
and
everywhere
you
find
them
without
a
garrison
except
at
a
few
points
where
troops
are
kept
for
special
purposes
not
to
coerce
or
to
threaten
a
state
but
stationed
in
seacoast
fortifications
there
merely
for
the
purposes
of
discipline
and
instruction
as
artillerists
you
find
all
the
other
forts
in
the
hands
of
and
and
before
a
moral
and
patriotic
people
standing
safely
there
as
the
property
of
the
country
i
asked
in
this
senate
weeks
ago
what
causes
the
peril
that
is
now
imminent
at
fort
moultrie
is
it
the
weakness
of
the
garrison
and
then
i
answered
no
it
is
its
presence
not
its
weakness
had
an
there
represented
the
federal
government
had
there
been
no
troops
no
physical
power
to
protect
it
i
would
have
pledged
my
life
upon
the
issue
that
no
question
ever
would
have
been
made
as
to
its
seizure
now
not
only
there
but
elsewhere
we
find
movements
of
troops
further
to
complicate
this
question
and
probably
to
precipitate
us
upon
the
issue
of
civil
war
and
worse
than
all
this
government
reposing
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
this
government
strong
in
the
affections
of
the
people
this
government
i
describe
it
as
our
fathers
made
it
is
now
furtively
sending
troops
to
occupy
positions
lest
the
mob
should
seize
them
when
before
in
the
history
of
our
land
was
it
that
a
mob
could
resist
the
sound
public
opinion
of
the
country
when
before
was
it
that
an
unarmed
magistrate
had
not
the
power
by
crying
i
command
the
peace
to
quell
a
mob
in
any
portion
of
the
land
yet
now
we
find
under
cover
of
night
troops
detached
from
one
position
to
occupy
another
fort
washington
standing
in
its
lonely
grandeur
and
overlooking
the
home
of
the
father
of
his
country
near
by
the
place
where
the
ashes
of
washington
repose
built
there
to
prevent
a
foreign
foe
from
coming
up
the
potomac
with
armed
ships
to
take
the
capital
fort
washington
is
garrisoned
by
marines
sent
secretly
away
from
the
navy
yard
at
washington
and
fort
mchenry
memorable
in
our
history
as
the
place
where
under
bombardment
the
banner
floated
through
the
darkness
of
night
the
point
which
was
consecrated
by
our
national
song
fort
mchenry
too
has
been
garrisoned
by
a
detachment
of
marines
sent
from
this
place
in
an
extra
train
and
sent
under
cover
of
the
night
so
that
even
the
mob
should
not
know
it
senators
the
responsibility
is
thrown
at
the
door
of
congress
let
us
take
it
it
is
our
duty
in
this
last
hour
to
seize
the
pillars
of
our
government
and
uphold
them
though
we
be
crushed
in
the
fall
then
what
is
our
policy
are
we
to
drift
into
war
are
we
to
stand
idly
by
and
allow
war
to
be
precipitated
upon
the
country
allow
an
officer
of
the
army
to
make
war
allow
an
unconfirmed
head
of
a
department
to
make
war
allow
a
general
of
the
army
to
make
war
allow
a
president
to
make
war
no
sir
our
fathers
gave
to
congress
the
power
to
declare
war
and
even
to
congress
they
gave
no
power
to
make
war
upon
a
state
of
the
union
it
could
not
have
been
given
except
as
a
power
to
dissolve
the
union
when
then
we
see
as
is
evident
to
the
whole
country
that
we
are
drifting
into
a
war
between
the
united
states
and
an
individual
state
does
it
become
the
senate
to
sit
listlessly
by
and
discuss
abstract
questions
and
read
patchwork
from
the
opinions
of
men
now
mingled
with
the
dust
are
we
not
bound
to
meet
events
as
they
come
before
us
manfully
and
patriotically
to
struggle
with
the
difficulties
which
now
oppress
the
country
in
the
message
yesterday
we
were
even
told
that
the
district
of
columbia
was
in
danger
in
danger
of
what
from
whom
comes
the
danger
is
there
a
man
here
who
dreads
that
the
deliberations
of
this
body
are
to
be
interrupted
by
an
armed
force
is
there
one
who
would
not
prefer
to
fall
with
dignity
at
his
station
the
representative
of
a
great
and
peaceful
government
rather
than
to
be
protected
by
armed
bands
and
yet
the
rumor
is
and
rumors
seem
now
to
be
so
authentic
that
we
credit
them
rather
than
other
means
of
information
that
companies
of
artillery
are
to
be
quartered
in
this
city
to
preserve
peace
where
the
laws
have
heretofore
been
supreme
and
that
this
district
is
to
become
a
camp
by
calling
out
every
man
within
its
limits
to
bear
arms
under
the
militia
law
are
we
invaded
is
there
an
insurrection
are
there
two
senators
here
who
would
not
be
willing
to
go
forth
as
a
file
and
put
down
any
resistance
which
showed
itself
in
this
district
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
the
reproach
meant
against
these
my
friends
from
the
south
who
advocate
southern
rights
and
state
rights
if
so
it
is
a
base
slander
we
claim
our
rights
under
the
constitution
we
claim
our
rights
reserved
to
the
states
and
we
seek
by
no
brute
force
to
gain
any
advantage
which
the
law
and
the
constitution
do
not
give
us
we
have
never
appealed
to
mobs
we
have
never
asked
for
the
army
and
the
navy
to
protect
us
on
the
soil
of
mississippi
not
the
foot
of
a
federal
soldier
has
been
impressed
since
when
flying
from
the
yellow
fever
they
sought
refuge
within
the
limits
of
our
state
and
on
the
soil
of
mississippi
there
breathes
not
a
man
who
asks
for
any
other
protection
than
that
which
our
constitution
gives
us
that
which
our
strong
arms
afford
and
the
brave
hearts
of
our
people
will
insure
in
every
contingency
senators
we
are
rapidly
drifting
into
a
position
in
which
this
is
to
become
a
government
of
the
army
and
navy
in
which
the
authority
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
maintained
not
by
law
not
by
constitutional
agreement
between
the
states
but
by
physical
force
and
will
you
stand
still
and
see
this
policy
consummated
will
you
fold
your
arms
the
degenerate
descendants
of
those
men
who
proclaimed
the
eternal
principle
that
government
rests
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
that
every
people
have
a
right
to
change
modify
or
abolish
a
government
when
it
ceases
to
answer
the
ends
for
which
it
was
established
and
permit
this
government
imperceptibly
to
slide
from
the
moorings
where
it
was
originally
anchored
and
become
a
military
despotism
it
was
well
said
by
the
senator
from
new
york
seward
whom
i
do
not
now
see
in
his
seat
well
said
in
a
speech
wherein
i
found
but
little
to
commend
that
this
union
could
not
be
maintained
by
force
and
that
a
union
of
force
was
a
despotism
it
was
a
great
truth
come
from
what
quarter
it
may
that
was
not
the
government
instituted
by
our
fathers
and
against
it
so
long
as
i
live
with
heart
and
hand
i
will
rebel
this
brings
me
to
a
passage
in
the
message
which
says
i
certainly
had
no
right
to
make
aggressive
war
upon
any
state
and
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
constitution
has
wisely
withheld
that
power
even
from
congress
very
good
but
the
right
and
the
duty
to
use
military
force
defensively
against
those
who
resist
the
federal
officers
in
the
exercise
of
their
legal
functions
and
against
those
who
assail
the
power
of
the
federal
government
are
clear
and
undeniable
is
it
so
where
does
he
get
it
our
fathers
were
so
jealous
of
a
standing
army
that
they
scarcely
would
permit
the
organization
and
maintenance
of
any
army
where
does
he
get
the
clear
and
undeniable
power
to
use
the
force
of
the
united
states
in
the
manner
he
there
proposes
to
execute
a
process
troops
may
be
summoned
in
a
posse
comitatus
and
here
in
the
history
of
our
government
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
in
the
earlier
and
as
it
is
frequently
said
the
better
days
of
the
republic
and
painfully
we
feel
that
they
were
better
indeed
a
president
of
the
united
states
did
not
recur
to
the
army
he
went
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
vaguely
and
confusedly
indeed
did
the
senator
from
tennessee
johnson
bring
forward
the
case
of
the
great
man
washington
as
one
in
which
he
had
used
a
means
which
he
argued
was
equivalent
to
the
coercion
of
a
state
for
he
said
that
washington
used
the
military
power
against
a
portion
of
a
people
of
the
state
and
why
might
he
not
as
well
have
used
it
against
the
whole
state
let
me
tell
that
senator
that
the
case
of
general
washington
has
no
such
application
as
he
supposes
it
was
a
case
of
insurrection
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
very
message
from
which
he
read
communicated
the
fact
that
governor
mifflin
thought
it
was
necessary
to
call
the
militia
of
the
adjoining
states
to
aid
him
president
washington
coöperated
with
governor
mifflin
he
called
the
militia
of
adjoining
states
to
coöperate
with
those
of
pennsylvania
he
used
the
militia
not
as
a
standing
army
it
was
by
the
consent
of
the
governor
it
was
by
his
advice
it
was
not
the
invasion
of
the
state
it
was
not
the
coercion
of
the
state
but
it
was
aiding
the
state
to
put
down
insurrection
and
in
the
very
manner
provided
for
in
the
constitution
itself
but
i
ask
again
what
power
has
the
president
to
use
the
army
and
navy
except
to
execute
process
are
we
to
have
courts
substituted
for
those
which
the
constitution
and
laws
provide
are
we
to
have
sergeants
sent
over
the
land
instead
of
civil
magistrates
not
so
thought
the
elder
adams
and
here
in
passing
i
will
pay
him
a
tribute
he
deserves
as
the
one
to
whom
more
than
any
other
man
among
the
early
founders
of
this
government
credit
is
due
for
the
military
principles
which
prevail
in
its
organization
associated
with
jefferson
originally
in
preparing
the
rules
and
articles
of
war
adams
reverted
through
the
long
pages
of
history
back
to
the
empire
of
rome
and
drew
from
that
foundation
the
very
rules
and
articles
of
war
which
govern
in
our
country
and
drew
them
thence
because
he
said
they
had
brought
two
nations
to
the
pinnacle
of
glory
referring
to
the
romans
and
the
britons
whose
military
law
was
borrowed
from
them
adams
however
when
an
insurrection
occurred
in
the
same
state
of
pennsylvania
not
only
relied
upon
the
militia
but
his
orders
through
secretary
mchenry
required
that
the
militia
of
the
vicinage
should
be
employed
and
though
he
did
order
troops
from
philadelphia
he
required
the
militia
of
the
northern
counties
to
be
employed
as
long
as
they
were
able
to
execute
the
laws
and
the
orders
given
to
colonel
mcpherson
then
in
new
jersey
were
that
federal
troops
should
not
go
across
the
jersey
line
except
in
the
last
resort
i
say
then
when
we
trace
our
history
to
its
early
foundation
under
the
first
two
presidents
of
the
united
states
we
find
that
this
idea
of
using
the
army
and
the
navy
to
execute
the
laws
at
the
discretion
of
the
president
was
one
not
even
entertained
still
less
acted
upon
in
any
case
then
senators
we
are
brought
to
consider
passing
events
a
little
garrison
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
now
occupies
a
post
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
gained
by
the
perfidious
breach
of
an
understanding
between
the
parties
concerned
and
here
that
i
may
do
justice
to
one
who
had
not
the
power
on
this
floor
at
least
to
right
himself
who
has
no
friend
here
to
represent
him
let
me
say
that
remark
does
not
apply
to
major
anderson
for
i
hold
that
though
his
orders
were
not
so
designed
as
i
am
assured
they
did
empower
him
to
go
from
one
post
to
another
and
to
take
his
choice
of
the
posts
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
but
in
so
doing
he
committed
an
act
of
hostility
when
he
dismantled
fort
moultrie
when
he
burned
the
carriages
and
spiked
the
guns
bearing
upon
fort
sumter
he
put
carolina
in
the
attitude
of
an
enemy
of
the
united
states
and
yet
he
has
not
shown
that
there
was
any
just
cause
for
apprehension
vague
rumors
had
reached
him
and
causeless
fear
seems
now
to
be
the
impelling
motive
of
every
public
act
vague
rumors
of
an
intention
to
take
fort
moultrie
but
sir
a
soldier
should
be
confronted
by
an
overpowering
force
before
he
spikes
his
guns
and
burns
his
carriages
a
soldier
should
be
confronted
by
a
public
enemy
before
he
destroys
the
property
of
the
united
states
lest
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
such
an
enemy
was
that
fort
built
to
make
war
upon
carolina
was
an
armament
put
into
it
for
such
a
purpose
or
was
it
built
for
the
protection
of
charleston
harbor
and
was
it
armed
to
make
that
protection
effective
if
so
what
right
had
any
soldier
to
destroy
that
armament
lest
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
carolina
some
time
since
i
presented
to
the
senate
resolutions
which
embodied
my
views
upon
this
subject
drawing
from
the
constitution
itself
the
data
on
which
i
based
those
resolutions
i
then
invoked
the
attention
of
the
senate
in
that
form
to
the
question
as
to
whether
garrisons
should
be
kept
within
a
state
against
the
consent
of
that
state
clear
was
i
then
as
i
am
now
in
my
conclusion
no
garrison
should
be
kept
within
a
state
during
a
time
of
peace
if
the
state
believes
the
presence
of
that
garrison
to
be
either
offensive
or
dangerous
our
army
is
maintained
for
common
defense
our
forts
are
built
out
of
the
common
treasury
to
which
every
state
contributes
and
they
are
perverted
from
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
erected
whenever
they
are
garrisoned
with
a
view
to
threaten
to
intimidate
or
to
control
a
state
in
any
respect
yet
we
are
told
this
is
no
purpose
to
coerce
a
state
we
are
told
that
the
power
does
not
exist
to
coerce
a
state
but
the
senator
from
tennessee
johnson
says
it
is
only
a
power
to
coerce
individuals
and
the
senator
from
ohio
wade
seems
to
look
upon
this
latter
power
as
a
very
harmless
power
in
the
hands
of
the
president
though
the
results
of
such
coercion
might
be
to
destroy
the
state
what
is
a
state
is
it
land
and
houses
is
it
taxable
property
is
it
the
organization
of
the
local
government
or
is
it
all
these
combined
with
the
people
who
possess
them
destroy
the
people
and
yet
not
make
war
upon
the
state
to
state
the
proposition
is
to
answer
it
by
reason
of
its
very
absurdity
it
is
like
making
desolation
and
calling
it
peace
there
being
as
it
is
admitted
on
every
hand
no
power
to
coerce
a
state
i
ask
what
is
the
use
of
a
garrison
within
a
state
where
it
needs
no
defense
the
answer
from
every
candid
mind
must
be
there
is
none
the
answer
from
every
patriotic
breast
must
be
peace
requires
under
all
such
circumstances
that
the
garrison
should
be
withdrawn
let
the
senate
as
the
responsibility
is
thrown
at
our
door
pass
those
resolutions
or
others
which
better
express
the
idea
contained
in
them
and
you
have
taken
one
long
step
toward
peace
one
long
stride
toward
the
preservation
of
the
government
of
our
fathers
the
president
message
of
december
however
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
diplomatic
paper
for
diplomacy
is
said
to
abhor
certainty
as
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
and
it
was
not
within
the
power
of
man
to
reach
any
fixed
conclusion
from
that
message
when
the
country
was
agitated
when
opinions
were
being
formed
when
we
were
drifting
beyond
the
power
ever
to
return
this
was
not
what
we
had
a
right
to
expect
from
the
chief
magistrate
one
policy
or
the
other
he
ought
to
have
taken
if
believing
this
to
be
a
government
of
force
if
believing
it
to
be
a
consolidated
mass
and
not
a
confederation
of
states
he
should
have
said
no
state
has
a
right
to
secede
every
state
is
subordinate
to
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
must
empower
me
with
physical
means
to
reduce
to
subjugation
the
state
asserting
such
a
right
if
not
if
a
man
and
a
democrat
as
for
many
years
it
has
been
my
pride
to
acknowledge
our
venerable
chief
magistrate
to
be
then
another
line
of
policy
should
have
been
taken
the
constitution
gave
no
power
to
the
federal
government
to
coerce
a
state
the
constitution
gave
an
army
for
the
purposes
of
common
defense
and
to
preserve
domestic
tranquillity
but
the
constitution
never
contemplated
using
that
army
against
a
state
a
state
exercising
the
sovereign
function
of
secession
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
government
unless
we
woo
her
with
the
voice
of
fraternity
and
bring
her
back
to
the
enticements
of
affection
one
policy
or
the
other
should
have
been
taken
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
which
though
my
opinion
is
well
known
but
one
policy
or
the
other
should
have
been
pursued
he
should
have
brought
his
opinion
to
one
conclusion
or
another
and
our
country
would
have
been
safer
than
it
is
what
is
the
message
before
us
does
it
benefit
the
case
is
there
a
solution
offered
here
we
are
informed
in
it
of
propositions
made
by
commissioners
from
south
carolina
we
are
not
informed
even
as
to
how
they
terminated
no
countervailing
proposition
is
presented
no
suggestion
is
made
we
are
left
drifting
loosely
without
chart
or
compass
there
is
in
our
recent
history
however
an
event
which
might
have
suggested
a
policy
to
be
pursued
when
foreigners
having
no
citizenship
within
the
united
states
declared
war
against
it
and
made
war
upon
it
when
the
inhabitants
of
a
territory
disgraced
by
institutions
offensive
to
the
laws
of
every
state
of
the
union
held
this
attitude
of
rebellion
when
the
executive
there
had
power
to
use
troops
he
first
sent
commissioners
of
peace
to
win
them
back
to
their
duty
when
south
carolina
a
sovereign
state
resumes
the
grants
she
had
delegated
when
south
carolina
stands
in
an
attitude
which
threatens
within
a
short
period
to
involve
the
country
in
a
civil
war
unless
the
policy
of
the
government
be
changed
no
suggestion
is
made
to
us
that
this
government
might
send
commissioners
to
her
no
suggestion
is
made
to
us
that
better
information
should
be
sought
there
is
no
policy
of
peace
but
we
are
told
the
army
and
navy
are
in
the
hands
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
used
against
those
who
assail
the
power
of
the
federal
government
then
my
friends
are
we
to
allow
events
to
drift
onward
to
this
fatal
consummation
are
we
to
do
nothing
to
restore
peace
shall
we
not
in
addition
to
the
proposition
i
have
already
made
to
withdraw
the
force
which
complicates
the
question
send
commissioners
there
in
order
that
we
may
learn
what
this
community
desire
what
this
community
will
do
and
put
the
two
governments
upon
friendly
relations
i
will
not
weary
the
senate
by
going
over
the
argument
of
coercion
my
friend
from
ohio
pugh
i
may
say
has
exhausted
the
subject
i
thank
him
because
it
came
appropriately
from
one
not
identified
by
his
position
with
south
carolina
it
came
more
effectively
from
him
than
it
would
have
done
from
me
had
i
as
i
have
not
a
power
to
present
it
as
forcibly
as
he
has
done
sirs
let
me
say
among
the
painful
reflections
which
have
crowded
upon
me
by
day
and
by
night
none
have
weighed
more
heavily
upon
my
heart
than
the
reflection
that
our
separation
severs
the
ties
which
have
so
long
bound
us
to
our
northern
friends
of
whom
we
are
glad
to
recognize
the
senator
as
a
type
now
let
us
return
a
moment
to
consider
what
would
have
been
the
state
of
the
case
if
the
garrison
at
charleston
had
been
withdrawn
the
fort
would
have
stood
there
not
dismantled
but
unoccupied
it
would
have
stood
there
in
the
hands
of
an
commissioners
would
have
come
to
treat
of
all
questions
with
the
federal
government
of
these
forts
as
well
as
others
they
would
have
remained
there
to
answer
the
ends
for
which
they
were
constructed
the
ends
of
defense
if
south
carolina
was
an
independent
state
then
she
might
hold
to
us
such
a
relation
as
rhode
island
held
after
the
dissolution
of
the
confederation
and
before
the
formation
of
the
union
when
rhode
island
appealed
to
the
sympathies
existing
between
the
states
connected
in
the
struggles
of
the
revolution
and
asked
that
a
commercial
war
should
not
be
waged
upon
her
these
forts
would
have
stood
there
then
to
cover
the
harbor
of
a
friendly
state
and
if
the
feeling
which
once
existed
among
the
people
of
the
states
had
subsisted
still
and
that
fort
had
been
attacked
brave
men
from
every
section
would
have
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
there
imperiled
their
lives
in
the
defense
of
a
state
identified
with
their
early
history
and
still
associated
in
their
breasts
with
affectionate
memories
the
first
act
of
this
kind
would
have
been
one
appealing
to
every
generous
motive
of
those
people
again
to
reconsider
the
question
of
how
we
could
live
together
and
through
that
bloody
ordeal
to
have
brought
us
into
the
position
in
which
our
fathers
left
us
there
need
have
been
no
collision
as
there
could
have
been
no
question
of
property
which
that
state
was
not
ready
to
meet
if
it
was
a
question
of
dollars
and
cents
they
came
here
to
adjust
it
if
it
was
a
question
of
covering
an
interior
state
their
interests
were
identical
in
whatever
way
the
question
could
have
been
presented
the
consequence
would
have
been
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
charge
of
maintaining
the
fort
and
to
throw
it
upon
the
state
which
had
resolved
to
be
independent
thus
we
see
that
no
evil
could
have
resulted
we
have
yet
to
learn
what
evil
the
opposite
policy
may
bring
telegraphic
intelligence
by
the
man
who
occupied
the
seat
on
the
right
of
me
in
the
old
chamber
was
never
relied
on
he
was
the
wisest
statesman
i
ever
knew
a
man
whose
prophetic
vision
foretold
all
the
trials
through
which
we
are
now
passing
whose
clear
intellect
elaborating
everything
borrowing
nothing
from
anybody
seemed
to
dive
into
the
future
and
to
unveil
those
things
which
are
hidden
to
other
eyes
need
i
say
i
mean
calhoun
no
other
man
than
he
would
have
answered
this
description
i
say
then
not
relying
upon
telegraphic
dispatches
we
still
have
information
enough
to
notify
us
that
we
are
on
the
verge
of
civil
war
that
civil
war
is
in
the
hands
of
men
irresponsible
as
it
seems
to
us
their
acts
unknown
to
us
their
discretion
not
covered
by
any
existing
law
or
usage
and
we
now
have
the
responsibility
thrown
upon
us
which
justifies
us
in
demanding
information
to
meet
an
emergency
in
which
the
country
is
involved
is
there
any
point
of
pride
which
prevents
us
from
withdrawing
that
garrison
i
have
heard
it
said
by
a
gallant
gentleman
to
whom
i
make
no
special
reference
that
the
great
objection
was
an
unwillingness
to
lower
the
flag
to
lower
the
flags
under
what
circumstances
does
any
man
courage
impel
him
to
stand
boldly
forth
to
take
the
life
of
his
brethren
does
any
man
insist
upon
going
upon
the
open
field
with
deadly
weapons
to
fight
his
brother
on
a
question
of
courage
there
is
no
point
of
pride
these
are
your
brethren
and
they
have
shed
as
much
glory
upon
that
flag
as
any
equal
number
of
men
in
the
union
they
are
the
men
and
that
is
the
locality
where
the
first
union
flag
was
unfurled
and
where
was
fought
a
gallant
battle
before
our
independence
was
declared
not
the
flag
with
thirteen
stripes
and
stars
but
a
flag
with
a
cross
of
george
and
the
long
stripes
running
through
it
when
the
gallant
moultrie
took
the
british
fort
johnson
and
carried
it
for
the
first
time
i
believe
did
the
union
flag
fly
in
the
air
and
that
was
in
october
when
he
took
the
position
and
threw
up
a
temporary
battery
with
and
sand
upon
the
site
called
fort
moultrie
that
fort
was
assailed
by
the
british
fleet
and
bombarded
until
the
old
logs
clinging
with
stern
tenacity
were
filled
with
balls
but
the
flag
still
floated
there
and
though
many
bled
the
garrison
conquered
those
old
logs
are
gone
the
eroding
current
is
even
taking
away
the
site
where
fort
moultrie
stood
the
gallant
men
who
held
it
now
mingle
with
the
earth
but
their
memories
live
in
the
hearts
of
a
brave
people
and
their
sons
yet
live
and
they
like
their
fathers
are
ready
to
bleed
and
to
die
for
the
cause
in
which
their
fathers
triumphed
glorious
are
the
memories
clinging
around
that
old
fort
which
now
for
the
first
time
has
been
abandoned
abandoned
not
even
in
the
presence
of
a
foe
but
under
the
imaginings
that
a
foe
might
come
and
guns
spiked
and
carriages
burned
where
the
band
of
moultrie
bled
and
with
an
insufficient
armament
repelled
the
common
foe
of
all
the
colonies
her
ancient
history
compares
proudly
with
the
present
can
there
then
be
a
point
of
pride
upon
so
sacred
a
soil
as
this
where
the
blood
of
the
fathers
cries
to
heaven
against
civil
war
can
there
be
a
point
of
pride
against
laying
upon
that
sacred
soil
the
flag
for
which
our
fathers
died
my
pride
senators
is
different
my
pride
is
that
that
flag
shall
not
set
between
contending
brothers
and
that
when
it
shall
no
longer
be
the
common
flag
of
the
country
it
shall
be
folded
up
and
laid
away
like
a
vesture
no
longer
used
that
it
shall
be
kept
as
a
sacred
memento
of
the
past
to
which
each
of
us
can
make
a
pilgrimage
and
remember
the
glorious
days
in
which
we
were
born
in
the
answer
of
the
commissioners
which
i
caused
to
be
read
yesterday
i
observed
that
they
referred
to
fort
sumter
as
remaining
a
memento
of
carolina
faith
it
is
an
instance
of
the
accuracy
of
the
opinion
which
i
have
expressed
it
stood
without
a
garrison
it
commanded
the
harbor
and
the
fort
was
known
to
have
the
armament
in
it
capable
of
defense
did
the
carolinians
attack
it
did
they
propose
to
seize
it
it
stood
there
safe
as
public
property
and
there
it
might
have
stood
to
the
end
of
the
negotiations
without
a
question
if
a
garrison
had
not
been
sent
into
it
it
was
the
faith
on
which
they
relied
that
the
federal
government
would
take
no
position
of
hostility
to
them
that
constituted
its
safety
and
by
which
they
lost
the
advantage
they
would
have
had
in
seizing
it
when
unoccupied
i
think
that
something
is
due
to
faith
as
well
as
fraternity
and
i
think
one
of
the
increasing
and
accumulative
obligations
upon
us
to
withdraw
the
garrison
from
that
fort
is
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
taken
taken
as
we
heard
by
the
reading
of
the
paper
yesterday
while
carolina
remained
under
the
assurance
that
the
would
not
be
violated
while
i
was
under
that
assurance
and
half
a
dozen
other
senators
now
within
the
sound
of
my
voice
felt
secure
under
the
same
pledge
that
nothing
would
be
done
until
negotiations
had
terminated
unless
it
was
to
withdraw
the
garrison
then
we
the
federal
government
broke
the
faith
we
committed
the
first
act
of
hostility
and
from
this
first
act
of
hostility
arose
all
those
acts
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
message
as
unprovoked
aggressions
the
seizing
of
forts
elsewhere
why
were
they
seized
is
the
first
law
of
nature
and
when
they
no
longer
had
confidence
that
this
federal
government
would
not
seize
the
forts
constructed
for
their
defense
and
use
them
for
their
destruction
they
only
obeyed
the
dictates
of
when
they
seized
the
forts
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
taking
possession
of
them
as
a
means
of
coercion
for
they
then
were
compelled
to
believe
this
federal
government
had
become
an
enemy
now
what
is
the
remedy
to
assure
them
that
you
do
not
intend
to
use
physical
force
against
them
is
your
first
remedy
to
assure
them
that
you
intend
to
consider
calmly
all
the
propositions
which
they
make
and
to
recognize
the
rights
which
the
union
was
established
to
secure
that
you
intend
to
settle
with
them
upon
a
basis
in
accordance
with
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
when
you
do
that
peace
will
prevail
over
the
land
and
force
become
a
thing
that
no
man
will
consider
necessary
i
am
here
confronted
with
a
question
which
i
will
not
argue
the
position
which
i
have
taken
necessarily
brings
me
to
its
consideration
without
arguing
it
i
will
merely
state
it
it
is
the
right
of
a
state
to
withdraw
from
the
union
the
president
says
it
is
not
a
constitutional
right
the
senator
from
ohio
wade
and
his
ally
the
senator
from
tennessee
johnson
argued
it
as
no
right
at
all
well
let
us
see
what
is
meant
by
a
constitutional
right
is
it
meant
to
be
a
right
derived
from
the
constitution
a
grant
made
in
the
constitution
if
that
is
what
is
meant
of
course
we
all
see
at
once
that
we
do
not
derive
it
in
that
way
is
it
intended
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
right
because
it
is
not
granted
in
the
constitution
that
shows
indeed
but
a
poor
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
our
government
all
that
is
not
granted
in
the
constitution
belongs
to
the
states
and
nothing
but
what
is
granted
in
the
constitution
belongs
to
the
federal
government
and
keeping
this
distinction
in
view
it
requires
but
little
argument
to
see
the
conclusion
at
which
we
necessarily
arrive
did
the
states
surrender
their
sovereignty
to
the
federal
government
did
the
states
agree
that
they
never
could
withdraw
from
the
federal
union
i
know
it
has
been
argued
here
that
the
confederation
said
the
articles
of
confederation
were
to
be
a
perpetual
bond
of
union
and
that
the
constitution
was
made
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
that
is
to
say
a
government
beyond
perpetuity
or
one
day
or
two
or
three
days
after
doomsday
but
that
has
no
foundation
in
the
constitution
itself
it
has
no
basis
in
the
nature
of
our
government
the
constitution
was
a
compact
between
independent
states
it
was
not
a
national
government
and
hence
madison
answered
with
such
effectiveness
to
patrick
henry
in
the
convention
of
virginia
which
ratified
the
constitution
denying
his
proposition
that
it
was
to
form
a
nation
and
stating
to
him
the
conclusive
fact
that
we
sit
here
as
a
convention
of
the
state
to
ratify
or
reject
that
constitution
and
how
then
can
you
say
that
it
forms
a
nation
and
is
adopted
by
the
mass
of
the
people
it
was
not
adopted
by
the
mass
of
the
people
as
we
all
know
historically
it
was
adopted
by
each
state
each
state
voluntarily
ratifying
it
entered
the
union
and
that
union
was
formed
whenever
nine
states
should
enter
it
and
in
abundance
of
caution
it
was
stated
in
the
resolutions
of
ratification
of
three
of
the
states
that
they
still
possessed
the
power
to
withdraw
the
grants
which
they
had
delegated
whenever
they
should
be
used
to
their
injury
or
oppression
i
know
it
is
said
that
this
meant
the
people
of
all
the
states
but
that
is
such
an
absurdity
that
i
suppose
it
hardly
necessary
to
answer
it
for
to
speak
of
an
elective
government
rendering
itself
injurious
and
oppressive
to
the
whole
body
of
the
people
by
whom
it
is
elected
is
such
an
absurdity
that
no
man
can
believe
it
and
to
suppose
that
a
state
convention
speaking
for
a
state
and
having
no
authority
to
speak
for
anybody
else
would
say
that
it
was
declaring
what
the
people
of
the
other
states
would
do
would
be
an
assumption
altogether
derogatory
to
the
sound
sense
and
sentiments
of
the
men
who
formed
the
constitution
and
ratified
it
but
in
abundance
of
caution
not
only
was
this
done
but
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
declared
that
all
which
had
not
been
delegated
was
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people
now
i
ask
where
among
the
delegated
grants
to
the
federal
government
do
you
find
any
power
to
coerce
a
state
where
among
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
do
you
find
any
prohibition
on
the
part
of
a
state
to
withdraw
and
if
you
find
neither
one
nor
the
other
must
not
this
power
be
in
that
great
depository
the
reserved
rights
of
the
states
how
was
it
ever
taken
out
of
that
source
of
all
power
to
be
given
to
the
federal
government
it
was
not
delegated
to
the
federal
government
it
was
not
prohibited
to
the
states
it
necessarily
remains
then
among
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
this
question
has
been
so
forcibly
argued
by
the
senator
from
louisiana
benjamin
that
i
think
it
unnecessary
to
pursue
it
three
times
the
proposition
was
made
to
give
power
to
coerce
the
states
in
the
convention
and
as
often
refused
opposed
as
a
proposition
to
make
war
on
a
state
and
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
government
could
not
make
war
upon
a
state
the
constitution
was
to
form
a
government
for
such
states
as
should
unite
it
had
no
application
beyond
those
who
should
voluntarily
adopt
it
among
the
delegated
powers
there
is
none
which
interferes
with
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
secession
by
a
state
as
a
right
of
sovereignty
it
remained
to
the
states
under
the
confederation
and
if
it
did
not
you
arraign
the
faith
of
the
men
who
framed
the
constitution
to
which
you
appeal
for
they
provided
that
nine
states
should
secede
from
thirteen
eleven
did
secede
from
the
thirteen
and
put
themselves
in
the
very
position
which
by
a
great
abuse
of
language
is
called
treason
against
the
two
states
of
north
carolina
and
rhode
island
they
still
claiming
to
adhere
to
the
perpetual
articles
of
confederation
these
eleven
states
absolving
themselves
from
the
obligations
which
arose
under
them
the
senator
from
tennessee
to
whom
i
must
refer
again
and
i
do
so
because
he
is
a
southern
senator
taking
the
most
hostile
ground
against
us
refers
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
points
to
the
time
when
that
state
may
do
those
things
which
he
has
declared
it
an
absurdity
for
any
state
to
perform
i
will
read
a
single
paragraph
from
his
speech
showing
what
his
language
is
in
order
that
i
may
not
by
any
possibility
produce
an
impression
upon
others
which
his
language
does
not
justify
here
are
the
expressions
to
which
i
refer
i
call
the
senator
attention
to
them
if
there
are
grievances
why
can
not
we
all
go
together
and
write
them
down
and
point
them
out
to
our
northern
friends
after
we
have
agreed
on
what
those
grievances
were
and
say
is
what
we
demand
here
our
wrongs
are
enumerated
upon
these
terms
we
have
agreed
and
now
after
we
have
given
you
a
reasonable
time
to
consider
these
additional
guarantees
in
order
to
protect
ourselves
against
these
wrongs
if
you
refuse
them
then
having
made
an
honorable
effort
having
exhausted
all
other
means
we
may
declare
the
association
to
be
broken
up
and
we
may
go
into
an
act
of
revolution
we
can
then
say
to
them
have
refused
to
give
us
guarantees
that
we
think
are
needed
for
the
protection
of
our
institutions
and
for
the
protection
of
our
other
interests
when
they
do
this
i
will
go
as
far
as
he
who
goes
the
farthest
now
it
does
appear
that
he
will
go
that
far
and
he
goes
a
little
further
than
anybody
i
believe
who
has
spoken
in
vindication
of
the
right
for
he
says
we
do
not
intend
that
you
shall
drive
us
out
of
this
house
that
was
reared
by
the
hands
of
our
fathers
it
is
our
house
it
is
the
constitutional
house
we
have
a
right
here
and
because
you
come
forward
and
violate
the
ordinances
of
this
house
i
do
not
intend
to
go
out
and
if
you
persist
in
the
violation
of
the
ordinances
of
the
house
we
intend
to
eject
you
from
the
building
and
retain
the
possession
ourselves
i
wonder
if
this
is
what
caused
the
artillery
companies
to
be
ordered
here
and
the
militia
of
this
city
to
be
organized
i
think
it
was
a
mere
figure
of
speech
i
do
not
believe
the
senator
from
tennessee
intended
to
kick
you
out
of
the
house
and
if
he
did
let
me
say
to
you
in
all
sincerity
we
who
claim
the
constitutional
right
of
a
state
to
withdraw
from
the
union
do
not
intend
to
help
him
he
says
however
and
this
softens
it
a
little
we
do
not
think
though
that
we
have
just
cause
for
going
out
of
the
union
now
we
have
just
cause
of
complaint
but
we
are
for
remaining
in
the
union
and
fighting
the
battle
like
men
what
does
that
mean
in
the
name
of
common
sense
i
ask
how
are
we
to
fight
in
the
union
we
take
an
oath
of
office
to
maintain
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
formed
for
domestic
tranquillity
and
how
then
are
we
to
fight
in
the
union
i
have
heard
the
proposition
from
others
but
i
have
not
understood
it
i
understand
how
men
fight
when
they
assume
attitudes
of
hostility
but
i
do
not
understand
how
men
remaining
connected
together
in
a
bond
as
brethren
sworn
to
mutual
aid
and
protection
still
propose
to
fight
each
other
i
do
not
understand
what
the
senator
means
if
he
chooses
to
answer
my
question
i
am
willing
to
hear
him
for
i
do
not
understand
how
we
are
to
fight
in
the
union
johnson
of
tennessee
when
my
speech
is
taken
altogether
i
think
my
meaning
can
be
very
easily
understood
what
i
mean
by
fighting
the
battle
in
the
union
is
i
think
very
distinctly
and
clearly
set
forth
in
my
speech
and
if
the
senator
will
take
it
from
beginning
to
end
i
apprehend
that
he
will
have
no
difficulty
in
ascertaining
what
i
meant
but
for
his
gratification
upon
this
particular
point
i
will
repeat
in
substance
what
i
then
said
as
to
fighting
the
battle
in
the
union
i
meant
that
we
should
remain
here
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
contend
for
all
its
guarantees
and
by
preserving
the
constitution
and
all
its
guarantees
we
would
preserve
the
union
our
true
place
to
maintain
these
guarantees
and
to
preserve
the
constitution
is
in
the
union
there
to
fight
our
battle
how
by
argument
by
appeals
to
the
patriotism
to
the
good
sense
and
to
the
judgment
of
the
whole
country
by
showing
the
people
that
the
constitution
had
been
violated
that
all
its
guarantees
were
not
complied
with
and
i
have
entertained
the
hope
that
when
they
were
possessed
of
that
fact
there
would
be
found
patriotism
and
honesty
enough
in
the
great
mass
of
the
people
north
and
south
to
come
forward
and
do
what
was
just
and
right
between
the
contending
sections
of
the
country
i
meant
that
the
true
way
to
fight
the
battle
was
for
us
to
remain
here
and
occupy
the
places
assigned
to
us
by
the
constitution
of
the
country
why
did
i
make
that
statement
it
was
because
on
the
day
of
march
next
we
shall
have
six
majority
in
this
body
and
if
as
some
apprehended
the
incoming
administration
shall
show
any
disposition
to
make
encroachments
upon
the
institution
of
slavery
encroachments
upon
the
rights
of
the
states
or
any
other
violation
of
the
constitution
we
by
remaining
in
the
union
and
standing
at
our
places
will
have
the
power
to
resist
all
these
encroachments
how
we
have
the
power
even
to
reject
the
appointment
of
the
cabinet
officers
of
the
incoming
president
then
should
we
not
be
fighting
the
battles
in
the
union
by
resisting
even
the
organization
of
the
administration
in
a
constitutional
mode
and
thus
at
the
very
start
disable
an
administration
which
was
likely
to
encroach
on
our
rights
and
to
violate
the
constitution
of
the
country
so
far
as
appointing
even
a
minister
abroad
is
concerned
the
incoming
administration
will
have
no
power
without
our
consent
if
we
remain
here
it
comes
into
office
handcuffed
powerless
to
do
harm
we
standing
here
hold
the
balance
of
power
in
our
hands
we
can
resist
it
at
the
very
threshold
effectually
and
do
it
inside
of
the
union
and
in
our
house
the
incoming
administration
has
not
even
the
power
to
appoint
a
postmaster
whose
salary
exceeds
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
without
consultation
with
and
the
acquiescence
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
the
president
has
not
even
the
power
to
draw
his
salary
his
thousand
dollars
per
annum
unless
we
appropriate
it
i
contend
then
that
the
true
place
to
fight
the
battle
is
in
the
union
and
within
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
the
army
and
navy
can
not
be
sustained
without
appropriations
by
congress
and
if
we
were
apprehensive
that
encroachments
would
be
made
on
the
southern
states
and
on
their
institutions
in
violation
of
the
constitution
we
could
prevent
him
from
having
a
dollar
even
to
feed
his
army
or
his
navy
davis
i
receive
the
answer
from
the
senator
and
i
think
i
comprehend
now
that
he
is
not
going
to
use
any
force
but
it
is
a
sort
of
fighting
that
is
to
be
done
by
votes
and
words
and
i
think
therefore
the
president
need
not
bring
artillery
and
order
out
the
militia
to
suppress
them
i
think
altogether
we
are
not
in
danger
of
much
bloodshed
in
the
mode
proposed
by
the
senator
from
tennessee
johnson
i
had
not
quite
done
but
if
the
senator
is
satisfied
davis
quite
satisfied
i
am
entirely
satisfied
that
the
answer
of
the
senator
shows
me
he
did
not
intend
to
fight
at
all
that
it
was
a
mere
figure
of
speech
and
does
not
justify
converting
the
federal
capital
into
a
military
camp
but
it
is
a
sort
of
revolution
which
he
proposes
it
is
a
revolution
under
the
forms
of
the
government
now
i
have
to
say
once
for
all
that
as
long
as
i
am
a
senator
here
i
will
not
use
the
powers
i
possess
to
destroy
the
very
government
to
which
i
am
accredited
i
will
not
attempt
in
the
language
of
the
senator
to
handcuff
the
president
i
will
not
attempt
to
destroy
the
administration
by
refusing
any
officers
to
administer
its
functions
i
should
vote
as
i
have
done
in
administrations
to
which
i
stood
in
nearest
relation
against
a
bad
nomination
but
i
never
would
agree
under
the
forms
of
the
constitution
and
with
the
powers
i
bear
as
a
senator
of
the
united
states
to
turn
those
powers
to
the
destruction
of
the
government
i
was
sent
to
support
i
leave
that
to
gentlemen
who
take
the
oath
with
a
mental
reservation
it
is
not
my
policy
if
i
must
have
revolution
i
say
let
it
be
a
revolution
such
as
our
fathers
made
when
they
were
denied
their
natural
rights
so
much
for
that
it
has
quieted
apprehension
and
i
hope
that
the
artillery
will
not
be
brought
here
that
the
militia
will
not
be
called
out
and
that
the
female
schools
will
continue
their
sessions
as
heretofore
laughter
the
authority
of
madison
however
was
relied
on
by
the
senator
from
tennessee
and
he
read
fairly
an
extract
from
madison
letter
to
webster
and
i
give
him
credit
for
reading
what
it
seems
to
me
destroys
his
whole
argument
it
is
this
clause
the
powers
of
the
government
being
exercised
as
in
other
elective
and
responsible
governments
under
the
control
of
its
constituents
the
people
and
the
legislatures
of
the
states
and
subject
to
the
revolutionary
rights
of
the
people
in
extreme
cases
now
sir
we
are
confusing
language
very
much
men
speak
of
revolution
and
when
they
say
revolution
they
mean
blood
our
fathers
meant
nothing
of
the
sort
when
they
spoke
of
revolution
they
meant
an
unalienable
right
when
they
declared
as
an
unalienable
right
the
power
of
the
people
to
abrogate
and
modify
their
form
of
government
whenever
it
did
not
answer
the
ends
for
which
it
was
established
they
did
not
mean
that
they
were
to
sustain
that
by
brute
force
they
meant
that
it
was
a
right
and
force
could
only
be
invoked
when
that
right
was
wrongfully
denied
great
britain
denied
the
right
in
the
case
of
the
colonies
and
therefore
our
revolution
for
independence
was
bloody
if
great
britain
had
admitted
the
great
american
doctrine
there
would
have
been
no
blood
shed
and
does
it
become
the
descendants
of
those
who
proclaimed
this
as
the
great
principle
on
which
they
took
their
place
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
now
to
proclaim
if
that
is
a
right
it
is
one
which
you
can
only
get
as
the
subjects
of
the
emperor
of
austria
may
get
their
rights
by
force
overcoming
force
are
we
in
this
age
of
civilization
and
political
progress
when
political
philosophy
had
advanced
to
the
point
which
seemed
to
render
it
possible
that
the
millennium
should
now
be
seen
by
prophetic
eyes
are
we
now
to
roll
back
the
whole
current
of
human
thought
and
again
to
return
to
the
mere
brute
force
which
prevails
between
beasts
of
prey
as
the
only
method
of
settling
questions
between
men
if
the
declaration
of
independence
be
true
and
who
here
gainsays
it
every
community
may
dissolve
its
connection
with
any
other
community
previously
made
and
have
no
other
obligation
than
that
which
results
from
the
breach
of
an
alliance
between
states
is
it
to
be
supposed
could
any
man
reasoning
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
men
who
fought
the
battles
of
the
revolution
for
community
independence
that
the
men
who
struggled
against
the
then
greatest
military
power
on
the
face
of
the
globe
in
order
that
they
might
possess
those
unalienable
rights
which
they
had
declared
terminated
their
great
efforts
by
transmitting
posterity
to
a
condition
in
which
they
could
only
gain
those
rights
by
force
if
so
the
blood
of
the
revolution
was
shed
in
vain
no
great
principles
were
established
for
force
was
the
law
of
nature
before
the
battles
of
the
revolution
were
fought
i
see
then
if
gentlemen
insist
on
using
the
word
revolution
in
the
sense
of
a
resort
to
force
a
very
great
difference
between
their
opinion
and
that
of
madison
madison
put
the
rights
of
the
people
over
and
above
everything
else
and
he
said
this
was
the
government
and
call
it
by
what
name
you
will
he
understood
ours
to
be
a
government
of
the
people
the
people
never
have
separated
themselves
from
those
rights
which
our
fathers
had
declared
to
be
unalienable
they
did
not
delegate
to
the
federal
government
the
powers
which
the
british
crown
exercised
over
the
colonies
they
did
not
achieve
their
independence
for
any
purpose
so
low
as
that
they
left
us
to
the
inheritance
of
freemen
living
in
independent
communities
the
states
united
for
the
purposes
which
they
thought
would
bless
posterity
it
is
in
the
exercise
of
this
reserved
right
as
defined
by
madison
as
one
to
which
all
the
powers
of
government
are
subject
that
the
people
of
a
state
in
convention
have
claimed
to
resume
the
functions
which
in
like
manner
they
had
made
to
the
federal
government
the
question
which
now
presents
itself
to
the
country
is
what
shall
we
do
with
events
as
they
stand
shall
we
allow
this
separation
to
be
total
shall
we
render
it
peaceful
with
a
view
to
the
chance
that
when
hunger
shall
brighten
the
intellects
of
men
and
the
teachings
of
hard
experience
shall
have
tamed
them
they
may
come
back
in
the
spirit
of
our
fathers
to
the
task
of
reconstruction
or
will
they
have
that
separation
partial
will
they
give
to
each
state
all
its
military
power
will
they
give
to
each
state
its
revenue
power
will
they
still
preserve
the
common
agent
and
will
they
thus
carry
on
a
government
different
from
that
which
now
exists
yet
not
separating
the
states
so
entirely
as
to
make
the
work
of
reconstruction
equal
to
a
new
creation
not
separating
them
so
as
to
render
it
utterly
impossible
to
administer
any
functions
of
the
government
in
security
and
peace
i
waive
the
question
of
duality
considering
that
a
dual
executive
would
be
the
institution
of
a
king
log
i
consider
a
dual
legislative
department
would
be
to
bring
into
antagonism
the
representatives
of
two
different
countries
to
war
perpetually
and
thus
to
continue
not
union
but
the
irrepressible
conflict
there
is
no
duality
possible
unless
there
be
two
confederacies
which
seems
to
me
consistent
with
the
interests
of
either
or
of
both
it
might
be
that
two
confederacies
could
be
so
organized
as
to
answer
jointly
many
of
the
ends
of
our
present
union
it
might
be
that
states
agreeing
with
each
other
in
their
internal
policy
having
a
similarity
of
interests
and
an
identity
of
purpose
might
associate
together
and
that
these
two
confederacies
might
have
relations
to
each
other
so
close
as
to
give
them
a
united
power
in
time
of
war
against
any
foreign
nation
these
things
are
possibilities
these
things
it
becomes
us
to
contemplate
these
things
it
devolves
on
the
majority
section
to
consider
now
for
with
every
motion
of
that
clock
is
passing
away
your
opportunity
it
was
greater
when
we
met
on
the
first
monday
in
december
than
it
is
now
it
is
greater
now
than
it
will
be
on
the
first
day
of
next
week
we
have
waited
long
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
mean
to
do
nothing
in
the
committee
of
thirteen
where
the
resolutions
of
the
senator
from
kentucky
crittenden
were
considered
various
attempts
were
made
but
no
prospect
of
any
agreement
on
which
it
was
possible
for
us
to
stand
in
security
for
the
future
could
be
matured
i
offered
a
proposition
which
was
but
the
declaration
of
that
which
the
constitution
announces
but
that
which
the
supreme
court
had
from
time
to
time
and
from
an
early
period
asserted
but
that
which
was
necessary
for
equality
in
the
union
not
one
single
vote
of
the
republican
portion
of
that
committee
was
given
for
the
proposition
looking
then
upon
separation
as
inevitable
not
knowing
how
that
separation
is
to
occur
or
at
least
what
states
it
is
to
embrace
there
remains
to
us
i
believe
as
the
consideration
which
is
most
useful
the
inquiry
how
can
this
separation
be
effected
so
as
to
leave
to
us
the
power
whenever
we
shall
have
the
will
to
reconstruct
it
can
only
be
done
by
adopting
a
policy
of
peace
it
can
only
be
done
by
denying
to
the
federal
government
all
power
to
coerce
it
can
only
be
done
by
returning
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
and
saying
this
is
a
government
of
fraternity
a
government
of
consent
and
it
shall
not
be
administered
in
a
departure
from
those
principles
i
do
not
regard
the
failure
of
our
constitutional
union
as
very
many
do
to
be
the
failure
of
to
be
conclusive
in
all
future
time
of
the
unfitness
of
man
to
govern
himself
our
state
governments
have
charge
of
nearly
all
the
relations
of
person
and
property
this
federal
government
was
instituted
mainly
as
a
common
agent
for
foreign
purposes
for
free
trade
among
the
states
and
for
common
defense
representative
liberty
will
remain
in
the
states
after
they
are
separated
liberty
was
not
crushed
by
the
separation
of
the
colonies
from
the
then
the
most
constitutional
monarchy
and
the
freest
government
known
still
less
will
liberty
be
destroyed
by
the
separation
of
these
states
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
by
the
of
it
there
will
be
injury
injury
to
all
differing
in
degree
differing
in
manner
the
injury
to
the
manufacturing
and
navigating
states
will
be
to
their
internal
prosperity
the
injury
to
the
southern
states
will
be
mainly
to
their
foreign
commerce
all
will
feel
the
deprivation
of
that
high
pride
and
power
which
belong
to
the
flag
now
representing
the
greatest
republic
if
not
the
greatest
government
upon
the
face
of
the
globe
i
would
that
it
still
remained
to
consider
what
we
might
calmly
have
considered
on
the
first
monday
in
december
how
this
could
be
avoided
but
events
have
rolled
past
that
point
you
would
not
make
propositions
when
they
would
have
been
effective
i
presume
you
will
not
make
them
now
and
i
know
not
what
effect
they
would
have
if
you
did
your
propositions
would
have
been
most
welcome
if
they
had
been
made
before
any
question
of
coercion
and
before
any
vain
boasting
of
power
for
pride
and
passion
do
not
often
take
counsel
of
pecuniary
interest
at
least
among
those
whom
i
represent
but
you
have
chosen
to
take
the
policy
of
clinging
to
words
the
chicago
platform
in
disregard
of
passing
events
and
have
hastened
them
onward
it
is
true
as
shown
by
the
history
of
all
revolutions
that
they
are
most
precipitated
and
intensified
by
obstinacy
and
vacillation
the
want
of
a
policy
the
obstinate
adherence
to
unimportant
things
have
brought
us
to
a
condition
where
i
close
my
eyes
because
i
can
not
see
anything
that
encourages
me
to
hope
in
the
long
period
which
elapsed
after
the
downfall
of
the
great
republics
of
the
east
when
despotism
seemed
to
brood
over
the
civilized
world
and
only
here
and
there
constitutional
monarchy
even
was
able
to
rear
its
head
when
all
the
great
principles
of
republican
and
representative
government
had
sunk
deep
fathomless
into
the
sea
of
human
events
it
was
then
that
the
storm
of
our
revolution
moved
the
waters
the
earth
the
air
and
the
sea
became
brilliant
and
from
the
foam
of
ages
rose
the
constellation
which
was
set
in
the
political
firmament
as
a
sign
of
unity
and
confederation
and
community
independence
coexistent
with
confederate
strength
that
constellation
has
served
to
bless
our
people
nay
more
its
light
has
been
thrown
on
foreign
lands
and
its
regenerative
power
will
outlive
perhaps
the
government
as
a
sign
for
which
it
was
set
it
may
be
pardoned
to
me
sir
who
in
my
boyhood
was
given
to
the
military
service
and
who
have
followed
under
tropical
suns
and
over
northern
snows
the
flag
of
the
union
if
i
here
express
the
deep
sorrow
which
always
overwhelms
me
when
i
think
of
taking
a
last
leave
of
that
object
of
early
affection
and
proud
association
feeling
that
henceforth
it
is
not
to
be
the
banner
which
by
day
and
by
night
i
was
ready
to
follow
to
hail
with
the
rising
and
bless
with
the
setting
sun
but
god
who
knows
the
hearts
of
men
will
judge
between
you
and
us
at
whose
door
lies
the
responsibility
men
will
see
the
efforts
made
here
and
elsewhere
that
we
have
been
silent
when
words
would
not
avail
and
have
curbed
an
impatient
temper
and
hoped
that
conciliatory
counsels
might
do
that
which
could
not
be
effected
by
harsh
means
and
yet
the
only
response
which
has
come
from
the
other
side
has
been
a
stolid
indifference
as
though
it
mattered
not
let
the
temple
fall
we
do
not
care
sirs
remember
that
such
conduct
is
offensive
and
that
men
may
become
indifferent
even
to
the
objects
of
their
early
attachments
if
our
government
should
fail
it
will
not
be
from
the
defect
of
the
system
though
each
planet
was
set
to
revolve
in
an
orbit
of
its
own
each
moving
by
its
own
impulse
yet
being
all
attracted
by
the
affections
and
interests
which
countervailed
each
other
there
was
no
inherent
tendency
to
disruption
it
has
been
the
perversion
of
the
constitution
it
has
been
the
substitution
of
theories
of
morals
for
principles
of
government
it
has
been
forcing
crude
opinions
upon
the
domestic
institutions
of
others
which
has
disturbed
these
planets
in
their
orbit
it
is
this
which
threatens
to
destroy
the
constellation
which
in
its
power
and
its
glory
had
been
gathering
stars
one
after
another
until
from
thirteen
it
had
risen
to
if
we
accept
the
argument
of
in
favor
of
coercion
as
the
theory
of
our
government
its
only
effect
will
be
to
precipitate
men
who
have
pride
and
into
the
assertion
of
the
freedom
and
independence
to
which
they
were
born
our
fathers
would
never
have
entered
into
a
confederate
government
which
had
within
itself
the
power
of
coercion
they
would
not
agree
to
remain
one
day
in
such
a
government
after
i
had
the
power
to
get
out
of
it
to
argue
that
the
man
who
follows
the
mandate
of
his
state
resuming
her
sovereign
jurisdiction
and
power
is
disloyal
to
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states
which
allegiance
he
only
owed
through
his
state
is
such
a
confusion
of
ideas
as
does
not
belong
to
an
ordinary
comprehension
of
our
government
it
is
treason
to
the
principle
of
community
independence
it
is
to
recur
to
that
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
which
in
england
cost
one
monarch
his
head
and
drove
another
into
exile
a
doctrine
which
since
the
revolution
of
has
obtained
nowhere
where
men
speak
the
english
tongue
yet
all
this
it
is
needful
to
admit
before
we
accept
this
doctrine
of
coercion
which
is
to
send
an
army
and
a
navy
to
do
that
which
there
are
no
courts
to
perform
to
execute
the
law
without
a
judicial
decision
and
without
an
officer
to
serve
process
this
i
say
would
degrade
us
to
the
basest
despotism
under
which
man
could
live
the
despotism
of
a
monster
without
the
sensibility
or
regardful
consideration
which
might
belong
to
an
hereditary
king
there
is
a
strange
similarity
in
the
position
of
affairs
at
the
present
day
to
that
which
the
colonies
occupied
lord
north
asserted
the
right
to
collect
the
revenue
and
insisted
on
collecting
it
by
force
he
sent
troops
to
boston
harbor
and
to
charlestown
and
he
quartered
troops
in
those
towns
the
result
was
collision
and
out
of
that
collision
came
the
separation
of
the
colonies
from
the
the
same
thing
is
being
attempted
not
the
law
not
the
civil
magistrate
but
troops
are
relied
upon
now
to
execute
the
laws
to
gather
taxes
in
the
southern
ports
the
army
and
navy
must
be
sent
to
perform
the
functions
of
magistrates
it
is
the
old
case
over
again
senators
of
the
north
you
are
reënacting
the
blunders
which
statesmen
in
great
britain
committed
but
among
you
there
are
some
who
like
chatham
and
burke
though
not
of
our
section
yet
are
vindicating
our
rights
i
have
heard
with
some
surprise
for
it
seemed
to
me
idle
the
repetition
of
the
assertion
heretofore
made
that
the
cause
of
the
separation
was
the
election
of
lincoln
it
may
be
a
source
of
gratification
to
some
gentlemen
that
their
friend
is
elected
but
no
individual
had
the
power
to
produce
the
existing
state
of
things
it
was
the
purpose
the
end
it
was
the
declaration
by
himself
and
his
friends
which
constitute
the
necessity
of
providing
new
safeguards
for
ourselves
the
man
was
nothing
save
as
he
was
the
representative
of
opinions
of
a
policy
of
purposes
of
power
to
inflict
upon
us
those
wrongs
to
which
freemen
never
tamely
submit
senators
i
have
spoken
longer
than
i
desired
i
had
supposed
it
was
possible
avoiding
argument
and
not
citing
authority
to
have
made
to
you
a
brief
address
it
was
thought
useless
to
argue
a
question
which
now
belongs
to
the
past
the
time
is
near
at
hand
when
the
places
which
have
known
us
as
colleagues
laboring
together
can
know
us
in
that
relation
no
more
for
ever
i
have
striven
to
avert
the
catastrophe
which
now
impends
over
the
country
unsuccessfully
and
i
regret
it
for
the
few
days
which
i
may
remain
i
am
willing
to
labor
in
order
that
that
catastrophe
shall
be
as
little
as
possible
destructive
to
public
peace
and
prosperity
if
you
desire
at
this
last
moment
to
avert
civil
war
so
be
it
it
is
better
so
if
you
will
but
allow
us
to
separate
from
you
peaceably
since
we
can
not
live
peaceably
together
to
leave
with
the
rights
we
had
before
we
were
united
since
we
can
not
enjoy
them
in
the
union
then
there
are
many
relations
which
may
still
subsist
between
us
drawn
from
the
associations
of
our
struggles
from
the
revolutionary
era
to
the
present
day
which
may
be
beneficial
to
you
as
well
as
to
us
if
you
will
not
have
it
thus
if
in
the
pride
of
power
if
in
contempt
of
reason
and
reliance
upon
force
you
say
we
shall
not
go
but
shall
remain
as
subjects
to
you
then
gentlemen
of
the
north
a
war
is
to
be
inaugurated
the
like
of
which
men
have
not
seen
sufficiently
numerous
on
both
sides
in
close
contact
with
only
imaginary
lines
of
division
and
with
many
means
of
approach
each
sustained
by
productive
sections
the
people
of
which
will
give
freely
both
of
money
and
of
store
the
conflicts
must
be
multiplied
indefinitely
and
masses
of
men
sacrificed
to
the
demon
of
civil
war
will
furnish
hecatombs
such
as
the
recent
campaign
in
italy
did
not
offer
at
the
end
of
all
this
what
will
you
have
effected
destruction
upon
both
sides
subjugation
upon
neither
a
treaty
of
peace
leaving
both
torn
and
bleeding
the
wail
of
the
widow
and
the
cry
of
the
orphan
substituted
for
those
peaceful
notes
of
domestic
happiness
that
now
prevail
throughout
the
land
and
then
you
will
agree
that
each
is
to
pursue
his
separate
course
as
best
he
may
this
is
to
be
the
end
of
war
through
a
long
series
of
years
you
may
waste
your
strength
distress
your
people
and
yet
at
last
must
come
to
the
position
which
you
might
have
had
at
first
had
justice
and
reason
instead
of
selfishness
and
passion
folly
and
crime
dictated
your
course
is
there
wisdom
is
there
patriotism
in
the
land
if
so
easy
must
be
the
solution
of
this
question
if
not
then
mississippi
gallant
sons
will
stand
like
a
wall
of
fire
around
their
state
and
i
go
hence
not
in
hostility
to
you
but
in
love
and
allegiance
to
her
to
take
my
place
among
her
sons
be
it
for
good
or
for
evil
i
shall
probably
never
again
attempt
to
utter
here
the
language
either
of
warning
or
of
argument
i
leave
the
case
in
your
hands
if
you
solve
it
not
before
i
go
you
will
have
still
to
decide
it
toward
you
individually
as
well
as
to
those
whom
you
represent
i
would
that
i
had
the
power
now
to
say
there
shall
be
peace
between
us
for
ever
i
would
that
i
had
the
power
now
to
say
the
intercourse
and
the
commerce
between
the
states
if
they
can
not
live
in
one
union
shall
still
be
uninterrupted
that
all
the
social
relations
shall
remain
undisturbed
that
the
son
in
mississippi
shall
visit
freely
his
father
in
maine
and
the
reverse
and
that
each
shall
be
welcomed
when
he
goes
to
the
other
not
by
himself
alone
but
also
by
his
neighbors
and
that
all
that
kindly
intercourse
which
has
subsisted
between
the
different
sections
of
the
union
shall
continue
to
exist
this
is
not
only
for
the
interest
of
all
but
it
is
my
profoundest
wish
my
sincerest
desire
that
such
remnant
of
that
which
is
passing
away
may
grace
the
memory
of
a
glorious
though
too
brief
existence
day
by
day
you
have
become
more
and
more
exasperated
false
reports
have
led
you
to
suppose
there
was
in
our
section
hostility
to
you
with
manifestations
which
did
not
exist
in
one
case
i
well
remember
when
the
senator
from
vermont
collamer
was
serving
with
me
on
a
special
committee
it
was
reported
that
a
gentleman
who
had
gone
from
a
commercial
house
in
new
york
had
been
inhumanly
treated
at
vicksburg
and
this
embarrassed
a
question
which
we
then
had
pending
i
wrote
to
vicksburg
for
information
and
my
friends
could
not
learn
that
such
a
man
had
ever
been
there
but
if
he
had
been
there
no
violence
certainly
had
been
offered
to
him
falsehood
and
suspicion
have
thus
led
you
on
step
by
step
in
the
career
of
crimination
and
perhaps
has
induced
to
some
part
of
your
aggression
such
evil
effects
we
have
heretofore
suffered
and
the
consequences
now
have
their
fatal
culmination
on
the
verge
of
war
distrust
and
passion
increase
the
danger
it
is
in
the
power
of
two
bad
men
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
telegraphic
line
between
washington
and
charleston
to
precipitate
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
united
states
into
a
conflict
of
arms
without
other
cause
to
have
produced
it
and
still
will
you
hesitate
still
will
you
do
nothing
will
you
sit
with
sublime
indifference
and
allow
events
to
shape
themselves
no
longer
can
you
say
the
responsibility
is
upon
the
executive
he
has
thrown
it
upon
you
he
has
notified
you
that
he
can
do
nothing
and
you
therefore
know
he
will
do
nothing
he
has
told
you
the
responsibility
now
rests
with
congress
and
i
close
as
i
began
by
invoking
you
to
meet
that
responsibility
bravely
to
act
the
patriot
part
if
you
will
the
angel
of
peace
may
spread
her
wings
though
it
be
over
divided
states
and
the
sons
of
the
sires
of
the
revolution
may
still
go
on
in
friendly
intercourse
with
each
other
ever
renewing
the
memories
of
a
common
origin
the
sections
by
the
diversity
of
their
products
and
habits
acting
and
reacting
beneficially
the
commerce
of
each
may
swell
the
prosperity
of
both
and
the
happiness
of
all
be
still
interwoven
together
thus
may
it
be
and
thus
it
is
in
your
power
to
make
it

occurred
a

two
of
your
batteries
fired
this
morning
upon
an
unarmed
vessel
bearing
the
flag
of
my
government
as
i
have
not
been
notified
that
war
has
been
declared
by
south
carolina
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
i
can
not
but
think
that
this
hostile
act
was
committed
without
your
sanction
or
authority
under
that
hope
and
that
alone
did
i
refrain
from
opening
fire
upon
your
batteries
i
have
the
honor
therefore
respectfully
to
ask
whether
the
act
one
i
believe
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
our
country
or
of
any
other
civilized
government
was
committed
in
obedience
to
your
instructions
and
to
notify
you
if
it
be
not
disclaimed
that
i
must
regard
it
as
an
act
of
war
and
that
i
shall
not
after
a
reasonable
time
for
the
return
of
my
messenger
permit
any
vessels
to
pass
within
range
of
the
guns
of
my
fort
in
order
to
save
as
far
as
in
my
power
the
shedding
of
blood
i
beg
that
you
will
have
due
notification
of
this
my
decision
given
to
all
concerned
hoping
however
that
your
answer
may
be
such
as
will
justify
a
further
continuance
of
forbearance
on
my
part
i
have
the
honor
to
be
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
robert
anderson
first
artillery
fort
sumter
south
carolina
from
reply
of
the
governor
to
major
state
of
south
carolina
executive
office
headquarters
charleston
sir
your
letter
has
been
received
in
it
you
make
certain
statements
which
very
plainly
show
that
you
have
not
been
fully
informed
by
your
government
of
the
precise
relations
which
now
exist
between
it
and
the
state
of
south
carolina
official
information
has
been
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
the
political
connection
heretofore
existing
between
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
states
which
were
known
as
the
united
states
had
ceased
and
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
had
resumed
all
the
power
it
had
delegated
to
the
united
states
under
the
compact
known
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
right
which
the
state
of
south
carolina
possessed
to
change
the
political
relations
it
held
with
other
states
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
been
solemnly
asserted
by
the
people
of
this
state
in
convention
and
now
does
not
admit
of
discussion
the
attempt
to
reënforce
the
troops
now
at
fort
sumter
or
to
retake
and
resume
possession
of
the
forts
within
the
waters
of
this
state
which
you
have
abandoned
after
spiking
the
guns
placed
there
and
doing
otherwise
much
damage
can
not
be
regarded
by
the
authorities
of
this
state
as
indicative
of
any
other
purpose
than
the
coercion
of
the
state
by
the
armed
force
of
the
government
to
repel
such
an
attempt
is
too
plainly
its
duty
to
allow
it
to
be
discussed
but
while
defending
its
waters
the
authorities
of
the
state
have
been
careful
so
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
state
that
no
act
however
necessary
for
its
defense
should
lead
to
a
useless
waste
of
life
special
agents
therefore
have
been
off
the
bar
to
warn
all
approaching
vessels
if
armed
or
unarmed
and
having
troops
to
reënforce
the
forts
on
board
not
to
enter
the
harbor
of
charleston
and
special
orders
have
been
given
to
the
commanders
of
all
the
forts
and
batteries
not
to
fire
at
such
vessels
until
a
shot
fired
across
their
bows
would
warn
them
of
the
prohibition
of
the
state
under
these
circumstances
the
star
of
the
west
it
is
understood
this
morning
attempted
to
enter
this
harbor
with
troops
on
board
and
having
been
notified
that
she
could
not
enter
was
fired
into
the
act
is
perfectly
justified
by
me
in
regard
to
your
threat
in
relation
to
vessels
in
the
harbor
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
you
must
judge
of
your
responsibilities
your
position
in
this
harbor
has
been
tolerated
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
and
while
the
act
of
which
you
complain
is
in
perfect
consistency
with
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
state
it
is
not
perceived
how
far
the
conduct
which
you
propose
to
adopt
can
find
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
any
country
or
be
reconciled
with
any
other
purpose
of
your
government
than
that
of
imposing
upon
this
state
the
condition
of
a
conquered
province
pickens
to
major
robert
anderson
fort
anderson
to
the
headquarters
fort

south

to
his
excellency
pickens
of
the
state
of
south
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
communication
of
and
to
say
that
under
the
circumstances
i
have
deemed
it
proper
to
refer
the
whole
matter
to
my
government
and
that
i
intend
deferring
the
course
indicated
in
my
note
of
this
morning
until
the
arrival
from
washington
of
the
instructions
i
may
receive
i
have
the
honor
also
to
express
a
hope
that
no
obstructions
will
be
placed
in
the
way
of
and
that
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
afford
every
facility
to
the
departure
and
return
of
the
bearer
lieutenant
talbot
army
who
has
been
directed
to
make
the
journey
i
have
the
honor
to
be
very
respectfully
robert
anderson
army
governor
to
the
president
of
the
united
state
of
south
carolina
executive
office
headquarters
charleston
sir
at
the
time
of
the
separation
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
from
the
united
states
fort
sumter
was
and
still
is
in
the
possession
of
troops
of
the
united
states
under
the
command
of
major
anderson
i
regard
that
possession
as
not
consistent
with
the
dignity
or
safety
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
i
have
this
day
addressed
to
major
anderson
a
communication
to
obtain
from
him
the
possession
of
that
fort
by
the
authorities
of
this
state
the
reply
of
major
anderson
informs
me
that
he
has
no
authority
to
do
what
i
required
but
he
desires
a
reference
of
the
demand
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
under
the
circumstances
now
existing
and
which
need
no
comment
by
me
i
have
determined
to
send
to
you
the
hon
hayne
the
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
have
instructed
him
to
demand
the
delivery
of
fort
sumter
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
to
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
the
demand
i
have
made
of
major
anderson
and
which
i
now
make
of
you
is
suggested
because
of
my
earnest
desire
to
avoid
the
bloodshed
which
a
persistence
in
your
attempt
to
retain
the
possession
of
that
fort
will
cause
and
which
will
be
unavailing
to
secure
you
that
possession
but
induce
a
calamity
most
deeply
to
be
deplored
if
consequences
so
unhappy
shall
ensue
i
will
secure
for
this
state
in
the
demand
which
i
now
make
the
satisfaction
of
having
exhausted
every
attempt
to
avoid
it
in
relation
to
the
public
property
of
the
united
states
within
fort
sumter
the
hon
hayne
who
will
hand
you
this
communication
is
authorized
to
give
you
the
pledge
of
the
state
that
the
valuation
of
such
property
will
be
accounted
for
by
this
state
upon
the
adjustment
of
its
relations
with
the
united
states
of
which
it
was
a
part
pickens
president
the
united
from
instructions
of
the
state
department
of
south
carolina
to
hon
state
of
south
carolina
executive
office
state
department
charleston
sir
the
governor
has
considered
it
proper
in
view
of
the
grave
questions
which
now
affect
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
united
states
to
make
a
demand
upon
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
the
delivery
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
of
fort
sumter
now
within
the
territorial
limits
of
this
sate
and
occupied
by
troops
of
the
united
states
you
are
now
instructed
to
proceed
to
washington
and
there
in
the
name
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
inquire
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
whether
it
was
by
his
order
that
troops
of
the
united
states
were
sent
into
the
harbor
of
charleston
to
reënforce
fort
sumter
if
he
avows
that
order
you
will
then
inquire
whether
he
asserts
a
right
to
introduce
troops
of
the
united
states
within
the
limits
of
this
state
to
occupy
fort
sumter
and
you
will
in
case
of
his
avowal
inform
him
that
neither
will
be
permitted
and
either
will
be
regarded
as
his
declaration
of
war
against
the
state
of
south
carolina
the
governor
to
save
life
and
determined
to
omit
no
course
of
proceeding
usual
among
civilized
nations
previous
to
that
condition
of
general
hostilities
which
belongs
to
war
and
not
knowing
under
what
order
or
by
what
authority
fort
sumter
is
now
held
demanded
from
major
robert
anderson
now
in
command
of
that
fort
its
delivery
to
the
state
that
officer
in
his
reply
has
referred
the
governor
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
washington
you
will
therefore
demand
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
of
the
united
states
from
that
fort
and
its
delivery
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
you
are
instructed
not
to
allow
any
question
of
property
claimed
by
the
united
states
to
embarrass
the
assertion
of
the
political
right
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
the
possession
of
fort
sumter
the
possession
of
that
fort
by
the
state
is
alone
consistent
with
the
dignity
and
safety
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
but
such
possession
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
right
to
compensation
in
money
in
another
government
if
it
has
against
the
state
of
south
carolina
any
just
claim
connected
with
that
fort
but
the
possession
of
the
fort
can
not
in
regard
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
be
compensated
by
any
consideration
of
any
kind
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
when
the
possession
of
it
by
the
government
is
invasive
of
the
dignity
and
affects
the
safety
of
the
state
that
possession
can
not
become
now
a
matter
of
discussion
or
negotiation
you
will
therefore
require
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
a
positive
and
distinct
answer
to
your
demand
for
the
delivery
of
the
fort
and
you
are
further
authorized
to
give
the
pledge
of
the
state
to
adjust
all
matters
which
may
be
and
are
in
their
nature
susceptible
of
valuation
in
money
in
the
manner
most
usual
and
upon
the
principles
of
equity
and
justice
always
recognized
by
independent
nations
for
the
ascertainment
of
their
relative
rights
and
obligations
in
such
matters
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
magrath
hayne
envoy
from
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
the
president
of
the
united
of
senators
of
seceding
states
to
hon
washington
city
hon
isaac
hayne
sir
we
are
apprised
that
you
visit
washington
as
an
envoy
from
the
state
of
south
carolina
bearing
a
communication
from
the
governor
of
your
state
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
relation
to
fort
sumter
without
knowing
its
contents
we
venture
to
request
you
to
defer
its
delivery
to
the
president
for
a
few
days
or
until
you
and
he
have
considered
the
suggestions
which
we
beg
leave
to
submit
we
know
that
the
possession
of
fort
sumter
by
troops
of
the
united
states
coupled
with
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
taken
is
the
chief
if
not
only
source
of
difficulty
between
the
government
of
south
carolina
and
that
of
the
united
states
we
would
add
that
we
too
think
it
a
just
cause
of
irritation
and
of
apprehension
on
the
part
of
your
state
but
we
have
also
assurances
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
under
which
major
anderson
left
fort
moultrie
and
entered
fort
sumter
with
the
forces
under
his
command
that
it
was
not
taken
and
is
not
held
with
any
hostile
or
unfriendly
purpose
toward
your
state
but
merely
as
property
of
the
united
states
which
the
president
deems
it
his
duty
to
protect
and
preserve
we
will
not
discuss
the
question
of
right
or
duty
on
the
part
of
either
government
touching
that
property
or
the
late
acts
of
either
in
relation
thereto
but
we
think
that
without
any
compromise
of
right
or
breach
of
duty
on
either
side
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
matter
of
differences
may
and
should
be
adopted
we
desire
to
see
such
an
adjustment
and
to
prevent
war
or
the
shedding
of
blood
we
represent
states
which
have
already
seceded
from
the
united
states
or
will
have
done
so
before
the
of
february
next
and
which
will
meet
your
state
in
convention
on
or
before
the
of
that
month
our
people
feel
that
they
have
a
common
destiny
with
your
people
and
expect
to
form
with
them
in
that
convention
a
new
confederation
and
provisional
government
we
must
and
will
share
your
fortunes
suffering
with
you
the
evils
of
war
if
it
can
not
be
avoided
and
enjoying
with
you
the
blessings
of
peace
if
it
can
be
preserved
we
therefore
think
it
especially
due
from
south
carolina
to
our
states
to
say
nothing
of
other
slaveholding
states
that
she
should
as
far
as
she
can
consistently
with
her
honor
avoid
initiating
hostilities
between
her
and
the
united
states
or
any
other
power
we
have
the
public
declaration
of
the
president
that
he
has
not
the
constitutional
power
or
the
will
to
make
war
on
south
carolina
and
that
the
public
peace
shall
not
be
disturbed
by
any
act
of
hostility
toward
your
state
we
therefore
see
no
reason
why
there
may
not
be
a
settlement
of
existing
difficulties
if
time
be
given
for
calm
and
deliberate
counsel
with
those
states
which
are
equally
involved
with
south
carolina
we
therefore
trust
that
an
arrangement
will
be
agreed
on
between
you
and
the
president
at
least
till
the
of
february
next
by
which
time
your
and
our
states
may
in
convention
devise
a
wise
just
and
peaceable
solution
of
existing
difficulties
in
the
mean
time
we
think
your
state
should
suffer
major
anderson
to
obtain
necessary
supplies
of
food
fuel
or
water
and
enjoy
free
communication
by
post
or
special
messenger
with
the
president
upon
the
understanding
that
the
president
will
not
send
him
reënforcements
during
the
same
period
we
propose
to
submit
this
proposition
and
your
answer
to
the
president
if
not
clothed
with
power
to
make
such
arrangement
then
we
trust
that
you
will
submit
our
suggestions
to
the
governor
of
your
state
for
his
instructions
until
you
have
received
and
communicated
his
response
to
the
president
of
course
your
state
will
not
attack
fort
sumter
and
the
president
will
not
offer
to
reënforce
it
we
most
respectfully
submit
these
propositions
in
the
earnest
hope
that
you
or
the
proper
authority
of
your
state
may
accede
to
them
we
have
the
honor
to
be
with
profound
esteem

obedient

all
necessary
supplies
of
food
including
fresh
meat
and
vegetables
and
i
believe
fuel
and
water
and
now
enjoy
free
communication
by
post
and
special
messengers
with
the
president
and
will
continue
to
do
so
certainly
until
the
door
of
negotiation
shall
be
closed
if
your
proposition
is
acceded
to
you
may
assure
the
president
that
attack
will
be
made
on
fort
sumter
until
a
response
from
the
governor
of
south
carolina
has
been
received
by
me
and
communicated
to
him
with
great
consideration
and
profound
esteem
your
obedient
servant
isaac
hayne
from
the
governor
and
council
of
south
of
senators
of
seceding
states
to
the
sir
we
have
been
requested
to
present
to
you
copies
of
a
correspondence
between
certain
senators
of
the
united
states
and
colonel
isaac
hayne
now
in
this
city
in
behalf
of
the
government
of
south
carolina
and
to
ask
that
you
will
take
into
consideration
the
subject
of
said
correspondence
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servants
benjamin
fitzpatrick
mallory
john
slidell
to
his
excellency
james
buchanan
united
to
the
letter
above
an
evasive
reply
was
returned
on
the
by
the
hon
joseph
holt
secretary
of
war
on
behalf
of
the
president
the
material
points
of
which
are
contained
in
the
following
paragraph
in
regard
to
the
proposition
of
colonel
hayne
that
no
reënforcements
will
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
in
the
interval
and
that
the
public
peace
will
not
be
disturbed
by
any
act
of
hostility
toward
south
carolina
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
any
such
assurances
the
president
has
no
authority
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement
or
understanding
as
an
executive
officer
he
is
simply
bound
to
protect
the
public
property
so
far
as
this
may
be
practicable
and
it
would
be
a
manifest
violation
of
his
duty
to
place
himself
under
engagements
that
he
would
not
perform
this
duty
either
for
an
indefinite
or
limited
period
at
the
present
moment
it
is
not
deemed
necessary
to
reënforce
major
anderson
because
he
makes
no
such
request
and
feels
quite
secure
in
his
position
should
his
safety
however
require
reënforcements
every
effort
will
be
made
to
supply
them
holt
concludes
his
letter
by
saying
major
anderson
is
not
menacing
charleston
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
happiest
result
which
can
be
attained
is
that
both
he
and
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
shall
remain
on
their
present
amicable
footing
neither
party
being
bound
by
any
obligations
whatever
except
the
high
christian
and
moral
duty
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
avoid
all
causes
of
mutual
irritation
very
respectfully
your

sir
in
answer
to
your
letter
of
the
inst
we
have
now
to
inform
you
that
after
communicating
with
the
president
we
have
received
a
letter
signed
by
the
secretary
of
war
and
addressed
to
fitzpatrick
mallory
and
slidell
on
the
subject
of
our
proposition
which
letter
we
now
inclose
to
you
although
its
terms
are
not
as
satisfactory
as
we
could
have
desired
in
relation
to
the
ulterior
purposes
of
the
executive
we
have
no
hesitation
in
expressing
our
entire
confidence
that
no
reënforcements
will
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
nor
will
the
public
peace
be
disturbed
within
the
period
requisite
for
full
communication
between
yourself
and
your
government
and
we
trust
therefore
that
you
will
feel
justified
in
applying
for
further
instructions
before
delivering
to
the
president
any
message
with
which
you
may
have
been
charged
we
take
this
occasion
to
renew
the
expression
of
an
earnest
hope
that
south

will
not
deem
it
incompatible
with
her
safety
dignity
or
honor
to
refrain
from
initiating
any
hostilities
against
any
power
whatsoever
or
from
taking
any
steps
tending
to
produce
collision
until
our
states
which
are
to
share
her
fortunes
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
joining
their
counsels
with
hers

some
of

your

addressed

from

this
communication
from
the

is
far
from
being
satisfactory
to
me
but
inasmuch
as
you
state
that
we
you
have
no

in
expressing
an
entire
confidence
that
no

will
be

with

i
withhold
the
communication
with
which
i
am
at
present
charged
and
refer
the
whole
matter
to
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
and
will
await
their
reply
gourdin
of
south
carolina
now
in
this
city
will
leave
here
by
the
evening
train
and
will
lay
before
the
governor
of
south
carolina
and
his
council
the
whole
correspondence
between
yourselves
and
myself
and
between
you
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
a
communication
from
me
asking
further
instructions
i
can
not
in
closing
but
express
my
deep
regret
that
the
president
should
deem
it
necessary
to
keep
a
garrison
of
troops
at
fort
sumter
for
the
protection
of
the
of
the
united
states
south
carolina
scorns
the
idea
of
appropriating
to
herself
the
of
another
whether
of
a
government
or
an
individual
without
accounting
to
the
last
dollar
for
everything
which
for
the
protection
of
her
citizens
and
in
vindication
of
her
own
honor
and
dignity
she
may
deem
it
necessary
to
take
into
her
own
possession
as
fort
sumter
is
in
far
greater
jeopardy
occupied
by
a
garrison
of
united
states
troops
than
it
would
be
if
delivered
over
to
the
state
authorities
with
the
pledge
that
in
regard
to
that
and
all
other
property
claimed
by
the
united
states
within
the
jurisdiction
of
south
carolina
they
would
fully
account
upon
a
fair
adjustment
upon
the
other
point
of
the
preservation
of
the
peace
and
the
avoidance
of
bloodshed
is
it
supposed
that
the
occupation
of
a
fort
in
the
midst
of
a
harbor
with
guns
bearing
upon
every
position
of
it
by
a
government
no
longer
acknowledged
can
be
other
than
the
occasion
of
constant
irritation
excitement
and
indignation
it
creates
a
condition
of
things
which
i
fear
is
but
little
calculated
to
advance
the
observance
of
the
high
christian
and
moral
duty
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
avoid
all
causes
of
mutual
irritation
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
his
communication
in
my
judgment
to
continue
to
hold
fort
sumter
by
united
states
troops
is
the
worst
possible
means
of
protecting
it
as
property
and
the
worst
possible
means
for
effecting
a
peaceful
solution
of
present
difficulties
i
beg
leave
in
conclusion
to
say
that
it
is
in
deference
to
the
unanimous
opinion
expressed
by
the
senators
present
in
washington
representing
states
which
have
already
seceded
from
the
united
states
or
will
have
done
so
before
the
of
february
next
that
i
comply
with
your
suggestions
and
i
feel
assured
that
suggestions
from
such
a
quarter
will
be
considered
with
profound
respect
by
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
and
will
have
great
weight
in
determining
their
action
with
high
consideration
i
have
the
honor
to
be
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
isaac
hayne
from
the
governor
and
council
of
south
hayne
to
the
president
of
the
united
washington
to
his
excellency
james
buchanan
sir
i
had
the
honor
to
hold
a
short
interview
with
you
on
the
informal
and
unofficial
having
previously
been
informed
that
you
desired
that
whatever
was
official
should
be
on
both
sides
conducted
by
written
communications
i
did
not
at
that
time
present
my
credentials
but
verbally
informed
you
that
i
bore
a
letter
from
the
governor
of
south
carolina
in
regard
to
the
occupation
of
fort
sumter
which
i
would
deliver
the
next
day
under
cover
of
a
written
communication
from
myself
the
next
day
before
such
communication
could
be
made
i
was
waited
upon
by
a
senator
from
alabama
who
stated
that
he
came
on
the
part
of
all
the
senators
then
in
washington
from
the
states
which
had
already
seceded
from
the
united
states
or
would
certainly
have
done
so
before
the
day
of
february
next
the
senator
from
alabama
urged
that
he
and
they
were
interested
in
the
subject
of
my
mission
in
almost
an
equal
degree
with
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
he
said
that
hostilities
commenced
between
south
carolina
and
your
government
would
necessarily
involve
the
states
represented
by
themselves
in
civil
strife
and
fearing
that
the
action
of
south
carolina
might
complicate
the
relations
of
your
government
to
the
seceded
and
seceding
states
and
thereby
interfere
with
a
peaceful
solution
of
existing
difficulties
these
senators
requested
that
i
would
withhold
my
message
to
yourself
until
a
consultation
among
themselves
could
be
had
to
this
i
agreed
and
the
result
of
the
consultation
was
the
letter
of
these
senators
addressed
to
me
dated
january
a
copy
of
which
is
in
your
possession
to
this
letter
i
replied
on
the
and
a
copy
of
that
reply
is
likewise
in
your
possession
this
correspondence
as
i
am
informed
was
made
the
subject
of
a
communication
from
senators
fitzpatrick
mallory
and
slidell
addressed
to
you
and
your
attention
called
to
the
contents
these
gentlemen
received
on
the
day
of
january
a
reply
to
their
application
conveyed
in
a
letter
addressed
to
them
dated
the
signed
by
the
hon
holt
secretary
of
war
of
this
letter
you
of
course
have
a
copy
this
letter
from
holt
was
communicated
to
me
under
the
cover
of
a
letter
from
all
the
senators
of
the
seceded
and
seceding
states
who
still
remained
in
washington
and
of
this
letter
too
i
am
informed
you
have
been
furnished
with
a
copy
this
reply
of
yours
through
the
secretary
of
war
to
the
application
made
by
the
senators
was
entirely
unsatisfactory
to
me
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
not
only
a
rejection
in
advance
of
the
main
proposition
made
by
these
senators
to
wit
that
an
arrangement
should
be
agreed
on
between
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
and
your
government
at
least
until
the
of
february
next
by
which
time
south
carolina
and
the
states
represented
by
the
senators
might
in
convention
devise
a
wise
just
and
peaceable
solution
of
existing
difficulties
in
the
mean
time
they
say
we
think
that
is
these
senators
that
your
state
south
carolina
should
suffer
major
anderson
to
obtain
necessary
supplies
of
food
fuel
or
water
and
enjoy
free
communication
by
post
or
special
messenger
with
the
president
upon
the
understanding
that
the
president
will
not
send
him
reënforcements
during
the
same
period
but
besides
this
rejection
of
the
main
proposition
there
was
in
holt
letter
a
distinct
refusal
to
make
any
stipulation
on
the
subject
of
reënforcement
even
for
the
short
time
that
might
be
required
to
communicate
with
my
government
this
reply
to
the
senators
was
as
i
have
stated
altogether
unsatisfactory
to
me
and
i
felt
sure
that
it
would
be
so
to
the
authorities
whom
i
represented
it
was
not
however
addressed
to
me
or
to
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
and
as
south
carolina
had
addressed
nothing
to
your
government
and
had
asked
nothing
at
your
hands
i
looked
not
to
holt
letter
but
to
the
note
addressed
to
me
by
the
senators
of
the
seceded
and
seceding
states
i
had
consented
to
withhold
my
message
at
instance
provided
they
could
get
assurances
to
that
no
reënforcements
would
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
in
the
interval
and
that
the
peace
should
not
be
disturbed
by
any
act
of
hostility
the
senators
expressed
in
their
note
to
me
of
the
instant
their
entire
confidence
that
no
reënforcements
will
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
nor
will
the
public
peace
be
disturbed
within
the
period
requisite
for
full
communication
between
you
myself
and
your
my
government
and
renewed
their
request
that
i
would
withhold
the
communication
with
which
i
stood
charged
and
await
further
instructions
this
i
have
done
the
further
instructions
arrived
on
the
instant
and
bear
date
the
i
now
have
the
honor
to
make
to
you
my
first
communication
as
special
envoy
from
the
government
of
south
carolina
you
will
find
inclosed
the
original
communication
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
from
the
governor
of
south
carolina
with
which
i
was
charged
in
charleston
on
the
day
of
january
instant
the
day
on
which
it
bears
date
i
am
now
instructed
by
the
governor
of
south
carolina
to
say
that
his
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
demand
which
is
contained
in
this
letter
has
not
only
been
confirmed
by
the
circumstances
which
your
my
mission
has
developed
but
is
now
increased
to
a
conviction
of
its
necessity
the
safety
of
the
state
requires
that
the
position
of
the
president
should
be
distinctly
understood
the
safety
of
all
seceding
states
requires
it
as
much
as
the
safety
of
south
carolina
if
it
be
so
that
fort
sumter
is
held
as
then
as
property
the
rights
whatever
they
may
be
of
the
united
states
can
be
ascertained
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
these
rights
the
pledge
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
you
are
i
am
authorized
to
give
if
fort
sumter
is
not
held
as
property
it
is
held
say
my
instructions
as
a
military
post
and
such
a
post
within
the
limits
of
south
carolina
can
not
be
tolerated
you
will
perceive
that
it
is
upon
the
presumption
that
it
is
solely
as
property
that
you
continue
to
hold
fort
sumter
that
i
have
been
selected
for
the
performance
of
the
duty
upon
which
i
have
entered
i
do
not
come
as
a
military
man
to
demand
the
surrender
of
a
fortress
but
as
the
legal
officer
of
the
state
its
to
claim
for
the
state
the
exercise
of
its
undoubted
right
of
eminent
domain
and
to
pledge
the
state
to
make
good
all
injury
to
the
rights
of
property
which
may
arise
from
the
exercise
of
the
claim
south
carolina
as
a
separate
independent
sovereignty
assumes
the
right
to
take
into
her
possession
everything
within
her
limits
essential
to
maintain
her
honor
or
her
safety
irrespective
of
the
question
of
property
subject
only
to
the
moral
duty
requiring
that
compensation
should
be
made
to
the
owner
this
right
she
can
not
permit
to
be
drawn
into
discussion
as
to
compensation
for
any
property
whether
of
an
individual
or
a
government
which
she
may
deem
it
necessary
for
her
honor
or
safety
to
take
into
her
possession
her
past
history
gives
ample
guarantee
that
it
will
be
made
upon
a
fair
accounting
to
the
last
dollar
the
proposition
now
is
that
her
law
officer
should
under
authority
of
the
governor
and
his
council
distinctly
pledge
the
faith
of
south
carolina
to
make
such
compensation
in
regard
to
fort
sumter
and
its
appurtenances
and
contents
to
the
full
extent
of
the
money
value
of
the
property
of
the
united
states
delivered
over
to
the
authorities
of
south
carolina
by
your
command
i
will
not
suppose
that
a
pledge
like
this
can
be
considered
insufficient
security
is
not
the
money
value
of
the
property
of
the
united
states
in
this
fort
situated
where
it
can
not
be
made
available
to
the
united
states
for
any
one
purpose
for
which
it
was
originally
constructed
worth
more
to
the
united
states
than
the
property
itself
why
then
insist
on
holding
it
by
an
armed
garrison
yet
such
has
been
the
ground
upon
which
you
have
invariably
placed
your
occupancy
of
this
fort
by
troops
beginning
prospectively
with
your
annual
message
of
the
december
again
in
your
special
message
of
the
january
and
still
more
emphatically
in
your
message
of
the
january
the
same
position
is
set
forth
in
your
reply
to
the
senators
through
the
secretary
of
war
it
is
there
virtually
conceded
that
fort
sumter
is
held
merely
as
property
of
the
united
states
which
you
deem
it
your
duty
to
protect
and
preserve
again
it
is
submitted
that
the
continuance
of
an
armed
possession
actually
jeopards
the
property
you
desire
to
protect
it
is
impossible
but
that
such
a
possession
if
continued
long
enough
must
lead
to
collision
no
people
not
completely
abject
and
pusillanimous
could
submit
indefinitely
to
the
armed
occupation
of
a
fortress
in
the
midst
of
the
harbor
of
its
principal
city
and
commanding
the
ingress
and
egress
of
every
ship
that
enters
the
port
the
daily
that
ply
upon
the
waters
moving
but
at
the
sufferance
of
aliens
an
attack
upon
this
fort
would
scarcely
improve
it
as
property
whatever
the
result
and
if
captured
it
would
no
longer
be
the
subject
of
account
to
protect
fort
sumter
merely
as
property
it
is
submitted
that
an
armed
occupancy
is
not
only
unnecessary
but
that
it
is
manifestly
the
worst
possible
means
which
can
be
resorted
to
for
such
an
object
your
reply
to
the
senators
through
holt
declares
it
to
be
your
sole
object
to
act
strictly
on
the
defensive
and
to
authorize
no
movement
against
south
carolina
unless
justified
by
a
hostile
movement
on
their
part
yet
in
reply
to
the
proposition
of
the
senators
that
no
reënforcements
should
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
provided
south
carolina
agrees
that
during
the
same
period
no
attack
should
be
made
you
say
it
is
impossible
for
me
your
secretary
to
give
you
the
senators
any
such
assurance
that
it
would
be
a
manifest
violation
of
his
your
duty
to
place
himself
yourself
under
engagements
that
he
you
would
not
perform
the
duty
either
for
an
indefinite
or
a
limited
period
in
your
message
of
the
in
expressing
yourself
in
regard
to
a
similar
proposition
you
say
however
strong
may
be
my
desire
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement
i
am
convinced
that
i
do
not
possess
the
power
congress
and
congress
alone
under
the
power
can
exercise
the
discretion
of
agreeing
to
abstain
any
and
all
acts
calculated
to
produce
a
collision
of
arms
between
this
and
other
governments
it
would
therefore
be
a
usurpation
for
the
executive
to
attempt
to
restrain
their
hands
by
an
agreement
in
regard
to
matters
over
which
he
has
no
constitutional
control
if
he
were
thus
to
act
they
might
pass
laws
which
he
should
be
bound
to
obey
though
in
conflict
with
his
agreement
the
proposition
it
is
suggested
was
addressed
to
you
under
the
laws
as
they
now
are
and
was
not
intended
to
refer
to
a
new
condition
of
things
arising
under
new
legislation
it
was
addressed
to
the
executive
discretion
acting
under
existing
laws
if
congress
should
under
the
power
or
in
any
other
way
legislate
in
a
manner
to
affect
the
peace
of
south
carolina
her
interests
or
her
rights
it
would
not
be
accomplished
in
secret
south
carolina
would
have
timely
notice
and
she
would
i
trust
endeavor
to
meet
the
emergency
it
is
added
in
the
letter
of
holt
that
at
the
present
moment
it
is
not
deemed
necessary
to
reënforce
major
anderson
because
he
makes
no
such
request
and
feels
quite
secure
in
his
position
but
should
his
safety
require
it
every
effort
will
be
made
to
supply
reënforcements
this
would
seem
to
ignore
the
other
branch
of
the
proposition
made
by
the
senators
that
no
attack
was
to
be
made
on
fort
sumter
during
the
period
suggested
and
that
major
anderson
should
enjoy
the
facilities
of
communication
etc
i
advert
to
this
point
however
for
the
purpose
of
saying
that
to
send
reënforcements
to
fort
sumter
could
not
serve
as
a
means
of
and
property
for
as
must
be
known
to
your
government
it
would
inevitably
lead
to
immediate
hostilities
in
which
property
on
all
sides
would
necessarily
suffer
south
carolina
has
every
disposition
to
preserve
the
public
peace
and
feels
i
am
sure
in
full
force
those
high
christian
and
moral
duties
referred
to
by
your
secretary
and
it
is
submitted
that
on
her
part
there
is
scarcely
any
consideration
of
mere
property
apart
from
honor
and
safety
which
could
induce
her
to
do
aught
to
jeopard
that
peace
still
less
to
inaugurate
a
protracted
and
bloody
civil
war
she
rests
her
position
on
something
higher
than
mere
property
it
is
a
consideration
of
her
own
dignity
as
a
sovereign
and
the
safety
of
her
people
which
prompts
her
to
demand
that
this
property
should
not
longer
be
used
as
a
military
post
by
a
government
she
no
longer
acknowledges
she
feels
this
to
be
an
imperative
duty
it
has
in
fact
become
an
absolute
necessity
of
her
condition
repudiating
as
you
do
the
idea
of
coercion
avowing
peaceful
intentions
and
expressing
a
patriot
horror
for
civil
war
and
bloody
strife
among
those
who
once
were
brethren
it
is
hoped
that
on
further
consideration
you
will
not
on
a
mere
question
of
property
refuse
the
reasonable
demand
of
south
carolina
which
honor
and
necessity
alike
compel
her
to
vindicate
should
you
disappoint
this
hope
the
responsibility
for
the
result
surely
does
not
rest
with
her
if
the
evils
of
war
are
to
be
encountered
especially
the
calamities
of
civil
war
an
elevated
statesmanship
would
seem
to
require
that
it
should
be
accepted
as
the
unavoidable
alternative
of
something
still
more
disastrous
such
as
national
dishonor
or
measures
materially
affecting
the
safety
or
permanent
interests
of
a
people
that
it
should
be
a
choice
deliberately
made
and
entered
upon
as
war
and
of
set
purpose
but
that
war
should
be
the
incident
or
accident
attendant
on
a
policy
professedly
peaceful
and
not
required
to
effect
the
object
which
is
avowed
as
the
only
end
intended
can
only
be
excused
when
there
has
been
no
warning
given
as
to
the
consequences
i
am
further
instructed
to
say
that
south
carolina
can
not
by
her
silence
appear
to
acquiesce
in
the
imputation
that
she
was
guilty
of
an
act
of
unprovoked
aggression
in
firing
on
the
star
of
the
west
though
an
unarmed
vessel
she
was
filled
with
armed
men
entering
her
territory
against
her
will
with
the
purpose
of
reënforcing
a
garrison
held
within
her
limits
against
her
protest
she
forbears
to
recriminate
by
discussing
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
attempting
such
a
reënforcement
at
all
as
well
as
of
the
disguised
and
secret
manner
in
which
it
was
intended
to
be
effected
and
on
this
occasion
she
will
say
nothing
as
to
the
manner
in
which
fort
sumter
was
taken
into
the
possession
of
its
present
occupants
the
interposition
of
the
senators
who
have
addressed
you
was
a
circumstance
unexpected
by
my
government
and
unsolicited
certainly
by
me
the
governor
while
he
appreciates
the
high
and
generous
motives
by
which
they
were
prompted
and
while
he
fully
approves
the
delay
which
in
deference
to
them
has
taken
place
in
the
presentation
of
this
demand
feels
that
it
can
not
longer
be
withheld
i
conclude
with
an
extract
from
the
instructions
just
received
by
me
from
the
government
of
south
carolina
the
letter
of
the
president
through
holt
may
be
received
as
the
reply
to
the
question
you
were
instructed
to
ask
as
to
his
assertion
of
his
right
to
send
reënforcements
to
fort
sumter
you
were
instructed
to
say
to
him
if
he
asserted
that
right
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
regarded
such
a
right
when
asserted
or
with
an
attempt
at
its
exercise
as
a
declaration
of
war
if
the
president
intends
it
shall
not
be
so
understood
it
is
proper
to
avoid
any
misconception
hereafter
that
he
should
be
informed
of
the
manner
in
which
the
governor
will
feel
bound
to
regard
it
if
the
president
when
you
have
stated
the
reasons
which
prompt
the
governor
in
making
the
demand
for
the
delivery
of
sumter
shall
refuse
to
deliver
the
fort
upon
the
pledge
you
have
been
authorized
to
make
you
will
communicate
that
refusal
without
delay
to
the
governor
if
the
president
shall
not
be
prepared
to
give
you
an
immediate
answer
you
will
communicate
to
him
that
his
answer
may
be
transmitted
within
a
reasonable
time
to
the
governor
at
this
place
charleston
south
carolina
the
governor
does
not
consider
it
necessary
that
you
i
should
remain
longer
in
washington
than
is
necessary
to
execute
this
the
closing
duty
of
your
my
mission
in
the
manner
now
indicated
to
you
me
as
soon
as
the
governor
shall
receive
from
you
information
that
you
have
closed
your
mission
and
the
reply
whatever
it
may
be
of
the
president
he
will
consider
the
conduct
which
may
be
necessary
on
his
part
allow
me
to
request
that
you
would
as
soon
as
possible
inform
me
whether
under
these
instructions
i
need
await
your
answer
in
washington
and
if
not
i
would
be
pleased
to
convey
from
you
to
my
government
information
as
to
the
time
when
an
answer
may
be
expected
in
charleston
with
high
consideration
i
am
very
respectfully

forsyth

close

as
they

in

by
requesting

to
appoint
as

a

as

in

they
are
charged
the
secretary
of
state
frankly
confesses
that
he
understands
the
events
which
have
recently
occurred
and
the
condition
of
political
affairs
which
actually
exists
in
the
part
of
the
union
to
which
his
attention
has
thus
been
directed
very
differently
from
the
aspect
in
which
they
are
presented
by
forsyth
and
crawford
he
sees
in
them
not
a
rightful
and
accomplished
revolution
and
an
independent
nation
with
an
established
government
but
rather
a
perversion
of
a
temporary
and
partisan
excitement
to
the
inconsiderate
purposes
of
an
unjustifiable
and
unconstitutional
aggression
upon
the
rights
and
the
authority
vested
in
the
federal
government
and
hitherto
benignly
exercised
as
from
their
very
nature
they
always
must
so
be
exercised
for
the
maintenance
of
the
union
the
preservation
of
liberty
and
the
security
peace
welfare
happiness
and
aggrandizement
of
the
american
people
the
secretary
of
state
therefore
avows
to
forsyth
and
crawford
that
he
looks
patiently
but
confidently
for
the
cure
of
evils
which
have
resulted
from
proceedings
so
unnecessary
so
unwise
so
unusual
and
so
unnatural
not
to
irregular
negotiations
having
in
view
new
and
untried
relations
with
agencies
unknown
to
and
acting
in
derogation
of
the
constitution
and
laws
but
to
regular
and
considerate
action
of
the
people
of
those
states
in
coöperation
with
their
brethren
in
the
other
states
through
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
such
extraordinary
conventions
if
there
shall
be
need
thereof
as
the
federal
constitution
contemplates
and
authorizes
to
be
assembled
it
is
however
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
of
state
on
this
occasion
not
to
invite
or
engage
in
any
discussion
of
these
subjects
but
simply
to
set
forth
his
reasons
for
declining
to
comply
with
the
request
of
forsyth
and
crawford
on
the
of
march
instant
the
then
newly
elected
president
of
the
united
states
in
view
of
all
the
facts
bearing
on
the
present
question
assumed
the
executive
administration
of
the
government
first
delivering
in
accordance
with
an
early
honored
custom
an
inaugural
address
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
secretary
of
state
respectfully
submits
a
copy
of
this
address
to
forsyth
and
crawford
a
simple
reference
to
it
will
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
these
gentlemen
that
the
secretary
of
state
guided
by
the
principles
therein
announced
is
prevented
altogether
from
admitting
or
assuming
that
the
states
referred
to
by
them
have
in
law
or
in
fact
withdrawn
from
the
federal
union
or
that
they
could
do
so
in
the
manner
described
by
forsyth
and
crawford
or
in
any
other
manner
than
with
the
consent
and
concert
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
be
given
through
a
national
convention
to
be
assembled
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
course
the
secretary
of
state
can
not
act
upon
the
assumption
or
in
any
way
admit
that
the
confederate
states
constitute
a
foreign
power
with
whom
diplomatic
relations
ought
to
be
established
under
these
circumstances
the
secretary
of
state
whose
official
duties
are
confined
subject
to
the
direction
of
the
president
to
the
conducting
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country
and
do
not
at
all
embrace
domestic
questions
or
questions
arising
between
the
several
states
and
the
federal
government
is
unable
to
comply
with
the
request
of
forsyth
and
crawford
to
appoint
a
day
on
which
they
may
present
the
evidences
of
their
authority
and
the
objects
of
their
visit
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
on
the
contrary
he
is
obliged
to
state
to
forsyth
and
crawford
that
he
has
no
authority
nor
is
he
at
liberty
to
recognize
them
as
diplomatic
agents
or
hold
correspondence
or
other
communication
with
them
finally
the
secretary
of
state
would
observe
that
although
he
has
supposed
that
he
might
safely
and
with
propriety
have
adopted
these
conclusions
without
making
any
reference
of
the
subject
to
the
executive
yet
so
strong
has
been
his
desire
to
practice
entire
directness
and
to
act
in
a
spirit
of
perfect
respect
and
candor
toward
forsyth
and
crawford
and
that
portion
of
the
people
of
the
union
in
whose
name
they
present
themselves
before
him
that
he
has
cheerfully
submitted
this
paper
to
the
president
who
coincides
generally
in
the
views
it
expresses
and
sanctions
the
decision
declining
official
intercourse
with
forsyth
and
crawford
the
foregoing
memorandum
was
filed
in
this
department
on
the
of
march
last
a
delivery
of
the
same
to
forsyth
and
crawford
was
delayed
as
was
understood
with
their
consent
they
have
now
through
their
secretary
communicated
their
desire
for
a
definite
disposition
of
the
subject
the
secretary
of
state
therefore
directs
that
a
duly
verified
copy
of
the
paper
be
now
delivered
commissioners
in
reply
to
washington

washington
march
with
postscript
under
date
of
instant
has
been
received
through
the
hands
of
pickett
secretary
of
this
commission
who
by
the
instructions
of
the
undersigned
called
for
it
on
yesterday
at
the
department
in
that
memorandum
you
correctly
state
the
purport
of
the
official
note
addressed
to
you
by
the
undersigned
on
the
ultimo
without
repeating
the
contents
of
that
note
in
full
it
is
enough
to
say
here
that
its
object
was
to
invite
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
a
friendly
consideration
of
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
seven
states
lately
the
federal
union
but
now
separated
from
it
by
the
sovereign
will
of
their
people
growing
out
of
the
pregnant
and
undeniable
fact
that
those
people
have
rejected
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
established
a
government
of
their
own
those
relations
had
to
be
friendly
or
hostile
the
people
of
the
old
and
new
governments
occupying
contiguous
territories
had
to
stand
to
each
other
in
the
relation
of
good
neighbors
each
seeking
their
happiness
and
pursuing
their
national
destinies
in
their
own
way
without
interference
with
the
other
or
they
had
to
be
rival
and
hostile
nations
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
had
no
hesitation
in
electing
its
choice
in
this
alternative
frankly
and
unreservedly
seeking
the
good
of
the
people
who
had
intrusted
them
with
power
in
the
spirit
of
humanity
of
the
christian
civilization
of
the
age
and
of
that
americanism
which
regards
the
true
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
people
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
among
its
first
acts
commissioned
the
undersigned
to
approach
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
the
of
peace
and
to
offer
to
adjust
the
great
questions
pending
between
them
in
the
only
way
to
be
justified
by
the
consciences
and
common
sense
of
good
men
who
had
nothing
but
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
two
confederacies
at
heart
your
government
has
not
chosen
to
meet
the
undersigned
in
the
conciliatory
and
peaceful
spirit
in
which
they
are
commissioned
persistently
wedded
to
those
fatal
theories
of
construction
of
the
federal
constitution
always
rejected
by
the
statesmen
of
the
south
and
adhered
to
by
those
of
the
administration
school
until
they
have
produced
their
natural
and
often
predicted
result
of
the
destruction
of
the
union
under
which
we
might
have
continued
to
live
happily
and
gloriously
together
had
the
spirit
of
the
ancestry
who
framed
the
common
constitution
animated
the
hearts
of
all
their
sons
you
now
with
a
persistence
untaught
and
uncured
by
the
ruin
which
has
been
wrought
refuse
to
recognize
the
great
fact
presented
to
you
of
a
completed
and
successful
revolution
you
close
your
eyes
to
the
existence
of
the
government
founded
upon
it
and
ignore
the
high
duties
of
moderation
and
humanity
which
attach
to
you
in
dealing
with
this
great
fact
had
you
met
these
issues
with
the
frankness
and
manliness
with
which
the
undersigned
were
instructed
to
present
them
to
you
and
treat
them
the
undersigned
had
not
now
the
melancholy
duty
to
return
home
and
tell
their
government
and
their
countrymen
that
their
earnest
and
ceaseless
efforts
in
behalf
of
peace
had
been
futile
and
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
meant
to
subjugate
them
by
force
of
arms
whatever
may
be
the
result
impartial
history
will
record
the
innocence
of
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
and
place
the
responsibility
of
the
blood
and
mourning
that
may
ensue
upon
those
who
have
denied
the
great
fundamental
doctrine
of
american
liberty
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
who
have
set
naval
and
land
armaments
in
motion
to
subject
the
people
of
one
portion
of
this
land
to
the
will
of
another
portion
that
that
can
never
be
done
while
a
survives
in
the
confederate
states
to
wield
a
weapon
the
undersigned
appeal
to
past
history
to
prove
these
military
demonstrations
against
the
people
of
the
seceded
states
are
certainly
far
from
being
in
keeping
and
consistency
with
the
theory
of
the
secretary
of
state
maintained
in
his
memorandum
that
these
states
are
still
component
parts
of
the
late
american
union
as
the
undersigned
are
not
aware
of
any
constitutional
power
in
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
levy
war
without
the
consent
of
congress
upon
a
foreign
people
much
less
upon
any
portion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
undersigned
like
the
secretary
of
state
have
no
purpose
to
invite
or
engage
in
discussion
of
the
subject
on
which
their
two
governments
are
so
irreconcilably
at
variance
it
is
this
variance
that
has
broken
up
the
old
union
the
disintegration
of
which
has
only
begun
it
is
proper
however
to
advise
you
that
it
were
well
to
dismiss
the
hopes
you
seem
to
entertain
that
by
any
of
the
modes
indicated
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
will
ever
be
brought
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
you
are
dealing
with
delusions
too
when
you
seek
to
separate
our
people
from
our
government
and
to
characterize
the
deliberate
sovereign
act
of
that
people
as
a
perversion
of
a
temporary
and
partisan
excitement
if
you
cherish
these
dreams
you
will
be
awakened
from
them
and
find
them
as
unreal
and
unsubstantial
as
others
in
which
you
have
recently
indulged
the
undersigned
would
omit
the
performance
of
an
obvious
duty
were
they
to
fail
to
make
known
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
have
declared
their
independence
with
a
full
knowledge
of
all
the
responsibilities
of
that
act
and
with
as
firm
a
determination
to
maintain
it
by
all
the
means
with
which
nature
has
endowed
them
as
that
which
sustained
their
fathers
when
they
threw
off
the
authority
of
the
british
crown
the
undersigned
clearly
understand
that
you
have
declined
to
appoint
a
day
to
enable
them
to
lay
the
objects
of
the
mission
with
which
they
are
charged
before
the
president
of
the
united
states
because
so
to
do
would
be
to
recognize
the
independence
and
separate
nationality
of
the
confederate
states
this
is
the
vein
of
thought
that
pervades
the
memorandum
before
us
the
truth
of
history
requires
that
it
should
distinctly
appear
upon
the
record
that
the
undersigned
did
not
ask
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
recognize
the
independence
of
the
confederate
states
they
only
asked
audience
to
adjust
in
a
spirit
of
amity
and
peace
the
new
relations
springing
from
a
manifest
and
accomplished
revolution
in
the
government
of
the
late
federal
union
your
refusal
to
entertain
these
overtures
for
a
peaceful
solution
the
active
naval
and
military
preparations
of
this
government
and
a
formal
notice
to
the
commanding
general
of
the
confederate
forces
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
that
the
president
intends
to
provision
fort
sumter
by
forcible
means
if
necessary
are
viewed
by
the
undersigned
and
can
only
be
received
by
the
world
as
a
declaration
of
war
against
the
confederate
states
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
knows
that
fort
sumter
can
not
be
provisioned
without
the
effusion
of
blood
the
undersigned
in
behalf
of
their
government
and
people
accept
the
gage
of
battle
thus
thrown
down
to
them
and
appealing
to
god
and
the
judgment
of
mankind
for
the
righteousness
of
their
cause
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
will
defend
their
liberties
to
the
last
against
this
flagrant
and
open
attempt
at
their
subjugation
to
sectional
power
this
communication
can
not
be
properly
closed
without
adverting
to
the
date
of
your
memorandum
the
official
note
of
the
undersigned
of
the
of
march
was
delivered
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
on
the
of
that
month
the
gentleman
who
delivered
it
informing
him
that
the
secretary
of
this
commission
would
call
at
twelve
noon
on
the
next
day
for
an
answer
at
the
appointed
hour
pickett
did
call
and
was
informed
by
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
that
the
engagements
of
the
secretary
of
state
had
prevented
him
from
giving
the
note
his
attention
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
then
asked
for
the
address
of
crawford
and
forsyth
the
members
of
the
commission
then
present
in
this
city
took
note
of
the
address
on
a
card
and
engaged
to
send
whatever
reply
might
be
made
to
their
lodgings
why
this
was
not
done
it
is
proper
should
be
here
explained
the
memorandum
is
dated
march
and
was
not
delivered
until
april
why
was
it
withheld
during
the
intervening
days
in
the
postscript
to
your
memorandum
you
say
it
was
delayed
as
was
understood
with
their
forsyth
and
crawford
consent
this
is
true
but
it
is
also
true
that
on
the
of
march
forsyth
and
crawford
were
assured
by
a
person
occupying
a
high
official
position
in
the
government
and
who
as
they
believed
was
speaking
by
authority
that
fort
sumter
would
be
evacuated
in
a
very
few
days
and
that
no
measure
changing
the
existing
prejudicially
to
the
confederate
states
as
respects
fort
pickens
was
then
contemplated
and
these
assurances
were
subsequently
repeated
with
the
addition
that
any
contemplated
change
as
respects
pickens
would
be
notified
to
us
on
the
of
april
we
were
again
informed
that
there
might
be
an
attempt
to
supply
fort
sumter
with
provisions
but
that
governor
pickens
should
have
previous
notice
of
this
attempt
there
was
no
suggestion
of
any
reinforcement
the
undersigned
did
not
hesitate
to
believe
that
these
assurances
expressed
the
intentions
of
the
administration
at
the
time
or
at
all
events
of
prominent
members
of
that
administration
this
delay
was
assented
to
for
the
express
purpose
of
attaining
the
great
end
of
the
mission
of
the
undersigned
to
wit
a
pacific
solution
of
existing
complications
the
inference
deducible
from
the
date
of
your
memorandum
that
the
undersigned
had
of
their
own
volition
and
without
cause
consented
to
this
long
in
the
grave
duties
with
which
they
were
charged
is
therefore
not
consistent
with
a
just
exposition
of
the
facts
of
the
case
the
intervening
days
were
employed
in
active
unofficial
efforts
the
object
of
which
was
to
smooth
the
path
to
a
pacific
solution
the
distinguished
personage
alluded
to
coöperating
with
the
undersigned
and
every
step
of
that
effort
is
recorded
in
writing
and
now
in
the
possession
of
the
undersigned
and
of
their
government
it
was
only
when
all
those
anxious
efforts
for
peace
had
been
exhausted
and
it
became
clear
that
lincoln
had
determined
to
appeal
to
the
sword
to
reduce
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
to
the
will
of
the
section
or
party
whose
president
he
is
that
the
undersigned
resumed
the
official
negotiation
temporarily
suspended
and
sent
their
secretary
for
a
reply
to
their
official
note
of
march
it
is
proper
to
add
that
during
these
days
two
gentlemen
of
official
distinction
as
high
as
that
of
the
personage
hitherto
alluded
to
aided
the
undersigned
as
intermediaries
in
these
unofficial
negotiations
for
peace
the
undersigned
commissioners
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
having
thus
made
answer
to
all
they
deem
material
in
the
memorandum
filed
in
the
department
on
the
of
march
last
have
the
honor
to
be
john
forsyth
martin
crawford
a
roman
seward
in
reply
to
the
department
of
state
washington
forsyth
crawford
and
roman
having
been
apprised
by
a
memorandum
which
has
been
delivered
to
them
that
the
secretary
of
state
is
not
at
liberty
to
hold
official
intercourse
with
them
will
it
is
presumed
expect
no
notice
from
him
of
the
new
communication
which
they
have
addressed
to
him
under
date
of
the
beyond
the
simple
acknowledgment
of
the
receipt
thereof
which
he
hereby
very
cheerfully
gives
campbell
to
washington
city
april
sir
on
the
of
march
ultimo
i
left
with
judge
crawford
one
of
the
commissioners
of
the
confederate
states
a
note
in
writing
to
the
effect
following
i
feel
entire
confidence
that
fort
sumter
will
be
evacuated
in
the
next
ten
days
and
this
measure
is
felt
as
imposing
great
responsibility
on
the
administration
i
feel
entire
confidence
that
no
measure
changing
the
existing
prejudicially
to
the
southern
confederate
states
is
at
present
contemplated
i
feel
an
entire
confidence
that
an
immediate
demand
for
an
answer
to
the
communication
of
the
commissioners
will
be
productive
of
evil
and
not
of
good
i
do
not
believe
that
it
ought
at
this
time
to
be
pressed
the
substance
of
this
statement
i
communicated
to
you
the
same
evening
by
letter
five
days
elapsed
and
i
called
with
a
telegram
from
general
beauregard
to
the
effect
that
sumter
was
not
evacuated
but
that
major
anderson
was
at
work
making
repairs
the
next
day
after
conversing
with
you
i
communicated
to
judge
crawford
in
writing
that
the
failure
to
evacuate
sumter
was
not
the
result
of
bad
faith
but
was
attributable
to
causes
consistent
with
the
intention
to
fulfill
the
engagement
and
that
as
regarded
pickens
i
should
have
notice
of
any
design
to
alter
the
existing
there
justice
nelson
was
present
at
these
conversations
three
in
number
and
i
submitted
to
him
each
of
my
written
communications
to
judge
crawford
and
informed
judge
crawford
that
they
had
his
judge
nelson
sanction
i
gave
you
on
the
of
march
a
substantial
copy
of
the
statement
i
had
made
on
the
the
of
march
arrived
and
at
that
time
a
telegram
came
from
governor
pickens
inquiring
concerning
colonel
lamon
whose
visit
to
charleston
he
supposed
had
a
connection
with
the
proposed
evacuation
of
fort
sumter
i
left
that
with
you
and
was
to
have
an
answer
the
following
monday
of
april
on
the
of
april
i
received
from
you
the
statement
in
writing
i
am
satisfied
the
government
will
not
undertake
to
supply
fort
sumter
without
giving
notice
to
governor
the
words
i
am
satisfied
were
for
me
to
use
as
expressive
of
confidence
in
the
remainder
of
the
declaration
the
proposition
as
originally
prepared
was
the
president
to
supply
sumter
but
will
not
do
so
and
your
verbal
explanation
was
that
you
did
not
believe
any
such
attempt
would
be
made
and
that
there
was
no
design
to
reënforce
sumter
there
was
a
departure
here
from
the
pledges
of
the
previous
month
but
with
the
verbal
explanation
i
did
not
consider
it
a
matter
then
to
complain
of
i
simply
stated
to
you
that
i
had
that
assurance
previously
on
the
of
april
i
addressed
you
a
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
alarm
that
the
preparations
by
the
government
had
created
and
asked
you
if
the
assurances
i
had
given
were
well
or
in
respect
to
sumter
your
reply
was
faith
as
to
sumter
fully
kept
wait
and
see
in
the
morning
paper
i
read
an
authorized
messenger
from
president
lincoln
informed
governor
pickens
and
general
beauregard
that
provisions
will
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
peaceably
or
by
this
was
the
of
april
at
charleston
the
day
following
your
last
assurance
and
is
the
last
evidence
of
the
full
faith
i
was
invited
to
and
in
the
same
paper
i
read
that
intercepted
dispatches
disclosed
the
fact
that
fox
who
had
been
allowed
to
visit
major
anderson
on
the
pledge
that
his
purpose
was
pacific
employed
his
opportunity
to
devise
a
plan
for
supplying
the
fort
by
force
and
that
this
plan
had
been
adopted
by
the
washington
government
and
was
in
process
of
execution
my
recollection
of
the
date
of
fox
visit
carries
it
to
a
day
in
march
i
learn
he
is
a
near
connection
of
a
member
of
the
cabinet
my
connection
with
the
commissioners
and
yourself
was
superinduced
by
a
conversation
with
justice
nelson
he
informed
me
of
your
strong
disposition
in
favor
of
peace
and
that
you
were
oppressed
with
a
demand
of
the
commissioners
of
the
confederate
states
for
a
reply
to
their
first
letter
and
that
you
desired
to
avoid
it
if
possible
at
that
time
i
told
him
i
might
perhaps
be
of
some
service
in
arranging
the
difficulty
i
came
to
your
office
entirely
at
his
request
and
without
the
knowledge
of
either
of
the
commissioners
your
depression
was
obvious
to
both
judge
nelson
and
myself
i
was
gratified
at
the
character
of
the
counsels
you
were
desirous
of
pursuing
and
much
impressed
with
your
observation
that
a
civil
war
might
be
prevented
by
the
success
of
my
mediation
you
read
a
letter
of
weed
to
show
how
irksome
and
responsible
the
withdrawal
of
troops
from
sumter
was
a
portion
of
my
communication
to
judge
crawford
on
the
of
march
was
founded
upon
these
remarks
and
the
pledge
to
evacuate
sumter
is
less
forcible
than
the
words
you
employed
these
words
were
before
this
letter
reaches
you
a
proposed
letter
by
me
to
president
davis
sumter
will
have
been
evacuated
the
commissioners
who
received
those
communications
conclude
they
have
been
abused
and
overreached
the
montgomery
government
hold
the
same
opinion
the
commissioners
have
supposed
that
my
communications
were
with
you
and
upon
the
that
hypothesis
were
prepared
to
arraign
you
before
the
country
in
connection
with
the
president
i
placed
a
peremptory
prohibition
upon
this
as
being
contrary
to
the
terms
of
my
communications
with
them
i
pledged
myself
to
them
to
communicate
information
upon
what
i
considered
as
the
best
authority
and
they
were
to
confide
in
the
ability
of
myself
aided
by
judge
nelson
to
determine
upon
the
credibility
of
my
informant
i
think
no
candid
man
who
will
read
over
what
i
have
written
and
considers
for
a
moment
what
is
going
on
at
sumter
but
will
agree
that
the
equivocating
conduct
of
the
administration
as
measured
and
interpreted
in
connection
with
these
promises
is
the
proximate
cause
of
the
great
calamity
i
have
a
profound
conviction
that
the
telegrams
of
the
of
april
of
general
beauregard
and
of
the
of
april
of
general
walker
the
secretary
of
war
can
be
referred
to
nothing
else
than
their
belief
that
there
has
been
systematic
duplicity
practiced
on
them
through
me
it
is
under
an
impressive
sense
of
the
weight
of
this
responsibility
that
i
submit
to
you
these
things
for
your
explanation
very
respectfully
signed
john
campbell
justice
of
the
supreme
court
united
hon
william
seward
of
campbell
to
secretary
washington
sir
i
inclose
you
a
letter
corresponding
very
nearly
with
one
i
addressed
to
you
one
week
ago
april
to
which
i
have
not
had
any
reply
the
letter
is
simply
one
of
inquiry
in
reference
to
facts
concerning
which
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
an
explanation
i
have
not
adopted
any
opinion
in
reference
to
them
which
may
not
be
modified
by
explanation
nor
have
i
affirmed
in
that
letter
nor
do
i
in
this
any
conclusion
of
my
own
unfavorable
to
your
integrity
in
the
whole
transaction
all
that
i
have
said
and
mean
to
say
is
that
an
explanation
is
due
from
you
to
myself
i
will
not
say
what
i
shall
do
in
case
this
request
is
not
complied
with
but
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
i
shall
feel
at
liberty
to
place
these
letters
before
any
person
who
is
entitled
to
ask
an
explanation

myself
