introduction
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
smollett
third
novel
was
given
to
the
world
in
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
writing
to
her
daughter
the
countess
of
bute
over
a
year
later
january
remarked
that
my
friend
smollett
has
certainly
a
talent
for
invention
though
i
think
it
flags
a
little
in
his
last
lady
mary
was
both
right
and
wrong
the
inventive
power
which
we
commonly
think
of
as
smollett
was
the
ability
to
work
over
his
own
experience
into
realistic
fiction
of
this
ferdinand
count
fathom
shows
comparatively
little
it
shows
relatively
little
too
of
smollett
vigorous
personality
which
in
his
earlier
works
was
present
to
give
life
and
interest
to
almost
every
chapter
were
it
to
describe
a
street
brawl
a
ludicrous
situation
a
whimsical
character
or
with
venomous
prejudice
to
gibbet
some
enemy
this
individuality
the
peculiar
spirit
of
the
author
which
can
be
felt
rather
than
described
is
present
in
the
dedication
of
fathom
to
doctor
who
is
no
other
than
smollett
himself
and
a
candid
revelation
of
his
character
by
the
way
this
dedication
contains
it
is
present
too
in
the
opening
chapters
which
show
likewise
in
the
picture
of
fathom
mother
something
of
the
author
peculiar
talent
for
subsequently
however
there
is
no
denying
that
the
smollett
invention
and
the
smollett
spirit
both
flag
and
yet
in
a
way
fathom
displays
more
invention
than
any
of
the
author
novels
it
is
based
far
less
than
any
other
on
personal
experience
unfortunately
such
invention
was
not
suited
to
smollett
genius
the
result
is
that
while
uninteresting
as
a
novel
of
contemporary
manners
fathom
has
an
interest
of
its
own
in
that
it
reveals
a
new
side
of
its
author
we
think
of
smollett
generally
as
a
rambling
storyteller
a
rational
unromantic
man
of
the
world
who
fills
his
pages
with
his
own
acquaintances
and
experiences
the
smollett
of
count
fathom
on
the
contrary
is
rather
a
forerunner
of
the
romantic
school
who
has
created
a
tolerably
organic
tale
of
adventure
out
of
his
own
brain
though
this
is
notably
less
readable
than
the
author
earlier
works
still
the
wonder
is
that
when
the
man
is
so
far
off
his
beat
he
should
yet
know
so
well
how
to
meet
the
strange
conditions
which
confront
him
to
one
whose
idea
of
smollett
genius
is
formed
entirely
by
random
and
pickle
and
humphry
clinker
ferdinand
count
fathom
will
offer
many
surprises
the
first
of
these
is
the
comparative
lifelessness
of
the
book
true
here
again
are
action
and
incident
galore
but
generally
unaccompanied
by
that
rough
georgian
common
in
smollett
which
is
so
interesting
to
contemplate
from
a
comfortable
distance
and
which
goes
so
far
towards
making
his
fiction
seem
real
nor
are
the
characters
for
the
most
part
enough
to
be
interesting
there
is
an
apparent
exception
to
be
sure
in
the
hero
mother
already
mentioned
the
hardened
whom
we
confidently
expect
to
become
vitalised
after
the
savage
fashion
of
smollett
characters
but
alas
we
have
no
chance
to
learn
the
lady
style
of
conversation
for
the
few
words
that
come
from
her
lips
are
but
partially
characteristic
we
have
only
too
little
chance
to
learn
her
manners
and
customs
in
the
fourth
chapter
while
she
is
making
sure
with
her
dagger
that
all
those
on
the
field
of
battle
whom
she
wishes
to
rifle
are
really
dead
an
officer
of
the
hussars
who
has
been
watching
her
lucrative
progress
unfeelingly
puts
a
brace
of
bullets
into
the
lady
brain
just
as
she
raises
her
hand
to
smite
him
to
the
heart
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
she
is
thus
removed
before
our
disappointment
at
the
of
her
promise
becomes
poignant
so
far
as
we
may
judge
from
the
other
personages
of
count
fathom
even
this
interesting
amazon
would
sooner
or
later
have
turned
into
a
wooden
figure
with
a
label
giving
the
necessary
information
as
to
her
character
such
certainly
is
her
son
fathom
the
hero
of
the
book
because
he
is
placarded
shrewd
villain
of
monstrous
inhumanity
we
are
fain
to
accept
him
for
what
his
creator
intended
but
seldom
in
word
or
deed
is
he
a
convincingly
real
villain
his
friend
and
foil
the
noble
young
count
de
melvil
is
no
more
alive
than
he
and
equally
wooden
are
joshua
the
jew
and
that
tedious
foolish
don
diego
neither
is
the
heroine
alive
the
peerless
monimia
but
then
in
her
case
want
of
vitality
is
not
surprising
the
presence
of
it
would
amaze
us
if
she
were
a
woman
throbbing
with
life
she
would
be
different
from
smollett
other
heroines
the
second
lady
of
the
melodrama
mademoiselle
de
melvil
though
by
no
means
vivified
is
yet
more
real
than
her
the
fact
that
they
are
mostly
inanimate
figures
is
not
the
only
surprise
given
us
by
the
personages
of
count
fathom
it
is
a
surprise
to
find
few
of
them
strikingly
whimsical
it
is
a
surprise
to
find
them
in
some
cases
far
more
distinctly
conceived
than
any
of
the
people
in
roderick
random
or
peregrine
pickle
in
the
second
of
these
we
saw
smollett
beginning
to
understand
the
use
of
incident
to
indicate
consistent
development
of
character
in
count
fathom
he
seems
fully
to
understand
this
principle
of
art
though
he
has
not
learned
to
apply
it
successfully
and
so
in
spite
of
an
excellent
conception
fathom
as
i
have
said
is
unreal
after
all
his
villainies
which
he
perpetrates
without
any
apparent
qualms
of
conscience
it
is
incredible
that
he
should
honestly
repent
of
his
crimes
we
are
much
inclined
to
doubt
when
we
read
that
his
vice
and
ambition
was
now
quite
mortified
within
him
the
subsequent
testimony
of
matthew
bramble
in
humphry
clinker
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
yet
fathom
up
to
this
point
is
consistently
drawn
and
drawn
for
a
purpose
to
show
that
roguery
though
successful
for
a
while
will
come
to
grief
in
the
end
to
heighten
the
effect
of
his
scoundrel
smollett
develops
parallel
with
him
the
virtuous
count
de
melvil
the
author
scheme
of
thus
using
one
character
as
the
foil
of
another
though
not
conspicuous
for
its
originality
shows
a
decided
advance
in
the
theory
of
constructive
technique
only
as
i
have
said
smollett
execution
is
now
defective
but
one
will
naturally
ask
if
fathom
lacks
the
amusing
and
not
infrequently
stimulating
of
smollett
former
novels
if
its
characters
though
are
seldom
divertingly
fantastic
and
never
thoroughly
animate
what
makes
the
book
interesting
the
surprise
will
be
greater
than
ever
when
the
answer
is
given
that
to
a
large
extent
the
plot
makes
fathom
interesting
yes
smollett
hitherto
indifferent
to
structure
has
here
written
a
story
in
which
the
plot
itself
often
clumsy
though
it
may
be
engages
a
reader
attention
one
actually
wants
to
know
whether
the
young
count
is
ever
going
to
receive
consolation
for
his
sorrows
and
inflict
justice
on
his
basely
ungrateful
pensioner
and
when
finally
all
turns
out
as
it
should
one
is
amazed
to
find
how
many
of
the
people
in
the
book
have
helped
towards
the
designed
conclusion
not
all
of
them
indeed
nor
all
of
the
adventures
are
indispensable
but
it
is
manifest
at
the
end
that
much
which
for
the
time
most
readers
think
irrelevant
such
as
don
diego
history
is
after
all
essential
it
has
already
been
said
that
in
count
fathom
smollett
appears
to
some
extent
as
a
romanticist
and
this
is
another
fact
which
lends
interest
to
the
book
that
he
had
a
powerful
imagination
is
not
a
surprise
any
one
versed
in
smollett
has
already
seen
it
in
the
remarkable
situations
which
he
has
put
before
us
in
his
earlier
works
these
do
not
indicate
however
that
smollett
possessed
the
imagination
which
could
excite
romantic
interest
for
in
roderick
random
and
in
peregrine
pickle
the
wonderful
situations
serve
chiefly
to
amuse
in
fathom
however
there
are
some
designed
to
excite
horror
and
one
at
least
is
eminently
successful
the
hero
night
in
the
wood
between
and
chalons
was
no
doubt
more
to
our
ancestors
than
it
is
to
us
who
have
become
acquainted
with
scores
of
similar
situations
in
the
small
number
of
exciting
romances
which
belong
to
literature
and
in
the
greater
number
which
do
not
still
even
a
reader
with
his
taste
jaded
by
trashy
novels
will
be
conscious
of
smollett
power
and
of
several
thrills
likewise
as
he
reads
about
fathom
experience
in
the
loft
in
which
the
beldame
locks
him
to
pass
the
night
this
situation
is
melodramatic
rather
than
romantic
as
the
word
is
used
technically
in
application
to
eighteenth
and
literature
there
is
no
little
in
fathom
however
which
is
genuinely
romantic
in
the
latter
sense
such
is
the
imprisonment
of
the
countess
in
the
whence
she
waves
her
handkerchief
to
the
young
count
her
son
and
rescuer
and
especially
so
is
the
scene
in
the
church
when
renaldo
the
very
name
is
romantic
visits
at
midnight
the
supposed
grave
of
his
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
sexton
to
open
the
door
his
soul
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
sorrow
the
uncommon
darkness
the
solemn
silence
and
lonely
situation
of
the
place
conspired
with
the
occasion
of
his
coming
and
the
dismal
images
of
his
fancy
to
produce
a
real
rapture
of
gloomy
expectation
which
the
whole
world
could
not
have
persuaded
him
to
disappoint
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
owl
screeched
from
the
ruined
battlement
the
door
was
opened
by
the
sexton
who
by
the
light
of
a
glimmering
taper
conducted
the
despairing
lover
to
a
dreary
aisle
and
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
saying
the
young
lady
lies
interred
we
have
here
such
an
amount
of
the
usual
romantic
machinery
of
the
school
of
poets
that
school
of
which
professor
phelps
calls
young
in
his
night
thoughts
the
most
conspicuous
exemplar
that
one
is
at
first
inclined
to
think
smollett
poking
fun
at
it
the
context
however
seems
to
prove
that
he
was
perfectly
serious
it
is
interesting
then
as
well
as
surprising
to
find
traces
of
the
romantic
spirit
in
his
fiction
over
ten
years
before
walpole
castle
of
otranto
it
is
also
interesting
to
find
so
much
melodramatic
feeling
in
him
because
it
makes
stronger
the
connection
between
him
and
his
disciple
dickens
from
all
that
i
have
said
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
usual
smollett
is
always
or
almost
always
absent
from
count
fathom
i
have
spoken
of
the
dedication
and
of
the
opening
chapters
as
what
we
might
expect
from
his
pen
there
are
besides
true
smollett
strokes
in
the
scenes
in
the
prison
from
which
melvil
rescues
fathom
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
satirical
smollett
fun
in
the
description
of
fathom
ups
and
downs
first
as
the
petted
beau
and
then
as
the
fashionable
doctor
in
chronicling
the
latter
meteoric
career
smollett
had
already
observed
the
peculiarity
of
his
countrymen
which
thackeray
was
fond
of
harping
on
in
the
next
century
the
maxim
which
universally
prevails
among
the
english
people
to
overlook
on
their
return
to
the
metropolis
all
the
connexions
they
may
have
chanced
to
acquire
during
their
residence
at
any
of
the
medical
wells
and
this
social
disposition
is
so
scrupulously
maintained
that
two
persons
who
live
in
the
most
intimate
correspondence
at
bath
or
tunbridge
shall
in
hours
meet
in
james
park
without
betraying
the
least
token
of
and
good
too
is
the
way
in
which
as
fathom
goes
rapidly
down
the
social
hill
he
makes
excuses
for
his
declining
splendour
his
chariot
was
overturned
with
a
hideous
crash
at
such
danger
to
himself
that
he
did
not
believe
he
should
ever
hazard
himself
again
in
any
sort
of
wheel
he
turned
off
his
men
for
maids
because
men
servants
are
generally
impudent
lazy
debauched
or
to
avoid
the
din
of
the
street
he
shifted
his
lodgings
into
a
quiet
obscure
court
and
so
forth
and
so
on
in
the
true
smollett
vein
but
after
all
such
of
the
old
sparks
are
struck
only
occasionally
apart
from
its
plot
which
not
a
few
writers
of
might
have
improved
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
is
less
interesting
for
itself
than
any
other
piece
of
fiction
from
smollett
pen
for
a
student
of
smollett
however
it
is
highly
interesting
as
showing
the
author
romantic
melodramatic
tendencies
and
the
growth
of
his
constructive
technique
maynadier
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
to
doctor
you
and
i
my
good
friend
have
often
deliberated
on
the
difficulty
of
writing
such
a
dedication
as
might
gratify
the
of
a
patron
without
exposing
the
author
to
the
ridicule
or
censure
of
the
public
and
i
think
we
generally
agreed
that
the
task
was
altogether
indeed
this
was
one
of
the
few
subjects
on
which
we
have
always
thought
in
the
same
manner
for
notwithstanding
that
deference
and
regard
which
we
mutually
pay
to
each
other
certain
it
is
we
have
often
differed
according
to
the
predominancy
of
those
different
passions
which
frequently
warp
the
opinion
and
perplex
the
understanding
of
the
most
judicious
in
dedication
as
in
poetry
there
is
no
medium
for
if
any
one
of
the
human
virtues
be
omitted
in
the
enumeration
of
the
patron
good
qualities
the
whole
address
is
construed
into
an
affront
and
the
writer
has
the
mortification
to
find
his
praise
prostituted
to
very
little
purpose
on
the
other
hand
should
he
yield
to
the
transports
of
gratitude
or
affection
which
is
always
apt
to
exaggerate
and
produce
no
more
than
the
genuine
effusions
of
his
heart
the
world
will
make
no
allowance
for
the
warmth
of
his
passion
but
ascribe
the
praise
he
bestows
to
interested
views
and
sordid
adulation
sometimes
too
dazzled
by
the
tinsel
of
a
character
which
he
has
no
opportunity
to
investigate
he
pours
forth
the
homage
of
his
admiration
upon
some
false
maecenas
whose
future
conduct
gives
the
lie
to
his
eulogium
and
involves
him
in
shame
and
confusion
of
face
such
was
the
fate
of
a
late
ingenious
author
the
author
of
the
seasons
who
was
so
often
put
to
the
blush
for
the
undeserved
incense
he
had
offered
in
the
heat
of
an
enthusiastic
disposition
misled
by
popular
applause
that
he
had
resolved
to
retract
in
his
last
will
all
the
encomiums
which
he
had
thus
prematurely
bestowed
and
stigmatise
the
unworthy
by
name
a
laudable
scheme
of
poetical
justice
the
execution
of
which
was
fatally
prevented
by
untimely
death
whatever
may
have
been
the
fate
of
other
dedicators
i
for
my
own
part
sit
down
to
write
this
address
without
any
apprehension
of
disgrace
or
disappointment
because
i
know
you
are
too
well
convinced
of
my
affection
and
sincerity
to
repine
at
what
i
shall
say
touching
your
character
and
conduct
and
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
this
public
distinction
is
a
testimony
of
my
particular
friendship
and
esteem
not
that
i
am
either
insensible
of
your
infirmities
or
disposed
to
conceal
them
from
the
notice
of
mankind
there
are
certain
foibles
which
can
only
be
cured
by
shame
and
mortification
and
whether
or
not
yours
be
of
that
species
i
shall
have
the
comfort
to
think
my
best
endeavours
were
used
for
your
reformation
know
then
i
can
despise
your
pride
while
i
honour
your
integrity
and
applaud
your
taste
while
i
am
shocked
at
your
i
have
known
you
trifling
superficial
and
obstinate
in
dispute
meanly
jealous
and
awkwardly
reserved
rash
and
haughty
in
your
resentments
and
coarse
and
lowly
in
your
connexions
i
have
blushed
at
the
weakness
of
your
conversation
and
trembled
at
the
errors
of
your
conduct
yet
as
i
own
you
possess
certain
good
qualities
which
overbalance
these
defects
and
distinguish
you
on
this
occasion
as
a
person
for
whom
i
have
the
most
perfect
attachment
and
esteem
you
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
indelicacy
with
which
your
faults
are
reprehended
and
as
they
are
chiefly
the
excesses
of
a
sanguine
disposition
and
looseness
of
thought
impatient
of
caution
or
control
you
may
thus
stimulated
watch
over
your
own
intemperance
and
infirmity
with
redoubled
vigilance
and
consideration
and
for
the
future
profit
by
the
severity
of
my
reproof
these
however
are
not
the
only
motives
that
induce
me
to
trouble
you
with
this
public
application
i
must
not
only
perform
my
duty
to
my
friends
but
also
discharge
the
debt
i
owe
to
my
own
interest
we
live
in
a
censorious
age
and
an
author
can
not
take
too
much
precaution
to
anticipate
the
prejudice
misapprehension
and
temerity
of
malice
ignorance
and
presumption
i
therefore
think
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
give
some
previous
intimation
of
the
plan
which
i
have
executed
in
the
subsequent
performance
that
i
may
not
be
condemned
upon
partial
evidence
and
to
whom
can
i
with
more
propriety
appeal
in
my
explanation
than
to
you
who
are
so
well
acquainted
with
all
the
sentiments
and
emotions
of
my
breast
a
novel
is
a
large
diffused
picture
comprehending
the
characters
of
life
disposed
in
different
groups
and
exhibited
in
various
attitudes
for
the
purposes
of
an
uniform
plan
and
general
occurrence
to
which
every
individual
figure
is
subservient
but
this
plan
can
not
be
executed
with
propriety
probability
or
success
without
a
principal
personage
to
attract
the
attention
unite
the
incidents
unwind
the
clue
of
the
labyrinth
and
at
last
close
the
scene
by
virtue
of
his
own
importance
almost
all
the
heroes
of
this
kind
who
have
hitherto
succeeded
on
the
english
stage
are
characters
of
transcendent
worth
conducted
through
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
to
that
goal
of
happiness
which
ever
ought
to
be
the
repose
of
extraordinary
yet
the
same
principle
by
which
we
rejoice
at
the
remuneration
of
merit
will
teach
us
to
relish
the
disgrace
and
discomfiture
of
vice
which
is
always
an
example
of
extensive
use
and
influence
because
it
leaves
a
deep
impression
of
terror
upon
the
minds
of
those
who
were
not
confirmed
in
the
pursuit
of
morality
and
virtue
and
while
the
balance
wavers
enables
the
right
scale
to
preponderate
in
the
drama
which
is
a
more
limited
field
of
invention
the
chief
personage
is
often
the
object
of
our
detestation
and
abhorrence
and
we
are
as
well
pleased
to
see
the
wicked
schemes
of
a
richard
blasted
and
the
perfidy
of
a
maskwell
exposed
as
to
behold
a
bevil
happy
and
an
edward
victorious
the
impulses
of
fear
which
is
the
most
violent
and
interesting
of
all
the
passions
remain
longer
than
any
other
upon
the
memory
and
for
one
that
is
allured
to
virtue
by
the
contemplation
of
that
peace
and
happiness
which
it
bestows
a
hundred
are
deterred
from
the
practice
of
vice
by
that
infamy
and
punishment
to
which
it
is
liable
from
the
laws
and
regulations
of
mankind
let
me
not
therefore
be
condemned
for
having
chosen
my
principal
character
from
the
purlieus
of
treachery
and
fraud
when
i
declare
my
purpose
is
to
set
him
up
as
a
beacon
for
the
benefit
of
the
unexperienced
and
unwary
who
from
the
perusal
of
these
memoirs
may
learn
to
avoid
the
manifold
snares
with
which
they
are
continually
surrounded
in
the
paths
of
life
while
those
who
hesitate
on
the
brink
of
iniquity
may
be
terrified
from
plunging
into
that
irremediable
gulf
by
surveying
the
deplorable
fate
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
that
the
mind
might
not
be
fatigued
nor
the
imagination
disgusted
by
a
succession
of
vicious
objects
i
have
endeavoured
to
refresh
the
attention
with
occasional
incidents
of
a
different
nature
and
raised
up
a
virtuous
character
in
opposition
to
the
adventurer
with
a
view
to
amuse
the
fancy
engage
the
affection
and
form
a
striking
contrast
which
might
heighten
the
expression
and
give
a
relief
to
the
moral
of
the
whole
if
i
have
not
succeeded
in
my
endeavours
to
unfold
the
mysteries
of
fraud
to
instruct
the
ignorant
and
entertain
the
vacant
if
i
have
failed
in
my
attempts

subject
folly
to
ridicule
and
vice
to
indignation

rouse
the
spirit

mirth

the
soul
of
compassion

touch
the
secret
springs

adorned

applause

iniquity
with
reproach

carefully
avoided
every
hint
or
expression

the
most
delicate

circumstances
which
whatever
may
be
my
fate
with
the
public
will
with
you
always
operate
in
favour
of
dear
sir
your
very
affectionate
friend
and
servant
the
author
chapter
one
some
sage
observations
that
naturally
introduce
our
important
history
cardinal
de
retz
very
judiciously
observes
that
all
historians
must
of
necessity
be
subject
to
mistakes
in
explaining
the
motives
of
those
actions
they
record
unless
they
derive
their
intelligence
from
the
candid
confession
of
the
person
whose
character
they
represent
and
that
of
consequence
every
man
of
importance
ought
to
write
his
own
memoirs
provided
he
has
honesty
enough
to
tell
the
truth
without
suppressing
any
circumstance
that
may
tend
to
the
information
of
the
reader
this
however
is
a
requisite
that
i
am
afraid
would
be
very
rarely
found
among
the
number
of
those
who
exhibit
their
own
portraits
to
the
public
indeed
i
will
venture
to
say
that
how
upright
soever
a
intentions
may
be
he
will
in
the
performance
of
such
a
task
be
sometimes
misled
by
his
own
phantasy
and
represent
objects
as
they
appeared
to
him
through
the
mists
of
prejudice
and
passion
an
unconcerned
reader
when
he
peruses
the
history
of
two
competitors
who
lived
two
thousand
years
ago
or
who
perhaps
never
had
existence
except
in
the
imagination
of
the
author
can
not
help
interesting
himself
in
the
dispute
and
espousing
one
side
of
the
contest
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
warm
adherent
what
wonder
then
that
we
should
be
heated
in
our
own
concerns
review
our
actions
with
the
same
that
they
had
formerly
acquired
and
recommend
them
to
the
world
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
paternal
affection
supposing
this
to
be
the
case
it
was
lucky
for
the
cause
of
historical
truth
that
so
many
pens
have
been
drawn
by
writers
who
could
not
be
suspected
of
such
partiality
and
that
many
great
personages
among
the
ancients
as
well
as
moderns
either
would
not
or
could
not
entertain
the
public
with
their
own
memoirs
from
this
want
of
inclination
or
capacity
to
write
in
our
hero
himself
the
undertaking
is
now
left
to
me
of
transmitting
to
posterity
the
remarkable
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
and
by
the
time
the
reader
shall
have
glanced
over
the
subsequent
sheets
i
doubt
not
but
he
will
bless
god
that
the
adventurer
was
not
his
own
historian
this
mirror
of
modern
chivalry
was
none
of
those
who
owe
their
dignity
to
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
and
are
consecrated
from
the
cradle
for
the
purposes
of
greatness
merely
because
they
are
the
accidental
children
of
wealth
he
was
heir
to
no
visible
patrimony
unless
we
reckon
a
robust
constitution
a
tolerable
appearance
and
an
uncommon
capacity
as
the
advantages
of
inheritance
if
the
comparison
obtains
in
this
point
of
consideration
he
was
as
much
as
any
man
indebted
to
his
parent
and
pity
it
was
that
in
the
sequel
of
his
fortune
he
never
had
an
opportunity
of
manifesting
his
filial
gratitude
and
regard
from
this
agreeable
act
of
duty
to
his
sire
and
all
those
tendernesses
that
are
reciprocally
enjoyed
betwixt
the
father
and
the
son
he
was
unhappily
excluded
by
a
small
circumstance
at
which
however
he
was
never
heard
to
repine
in
short
had
he
been
brought
forth
in
the
fabulous
ages
of
the
world
the
nature
of
his
origin
might
have
turned
to
his
account
he
might
like
other
heroes
of
antiquity
have
laid
claim
to
divine
extraction
without
running
the
risk
of
being
claimed
by
an
earthly
father
not
that
his
parents
had
any
reason
to
disown
or
renounce
their
offspring
or
that
there
was
anything
preternatural
in
the
circumstances
of
his
generation
and
birth
on
the
contrary
he
was
from
the
beginning
a
child
of
promising
parts
and
in
due
course
of
nature
ushered
into
the
world
amidst
a
whole
cloud
of
witnesses
but
that
he
was
acknowledged
by
no
mortal
sire
solely
proceeded
from
the
uncertainty
of
his
mother
whose
affections
were
so
dissipated
among
a
number
of
admirers
that
she
could
never
pitch
upon
the
person
from
whose
loins
our
hero
sprung
over
and
above
this
important
doubt
under
which
he
was
begotten
other
particularities
attended
his
birth
and
seemed
to
mark
him
out
as
something
uncommon
among
the
sons
of
men
he
was
brought
forth
in
a
waggon
and
might
be
said
to
be
literally
a
native
of
two
different
countries
for
though
he
first
saw
the
light
in
holland
he
was
not
born
till
after
the
carriage
arrived
in
flanders
so
that
all
these
extraordinary
circumstances
considered
the
task
of
determining
to
what
government
he
naturally
owed
allegiance
would
be
at
least
as
difficult
as
that
of
ascertaining
the
so
much
contested
birthplace
of

it
is
the
count
mother
was
an
englishwoman
who
after
having
been
five
times
a
widow
in
one
campaign
was
in
the
last
year
of
the
renowned
marlborough
command
numbered
among
the
baggage
of
the
allied
army
which
she
still
accompanied
through
pure
benevolence
of
spirit
supplying
the
ranks
with
the
refreshing
streams
of
choice
geneva
and
accommodating
individuals
with
clean
linen
as
the
emergency
of
their
occasions
required
nor
was
her
philanthropy
altogether
confined
to
such
ministration
she
abounded
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
which
flowed
plentifully
among
her
and
to
every
son
of
mars
who
cultivated
her
favour
she
liberally
dispensed
her
smiles
in
order
to
sweeten
the
toils
and
dangers
of
the
field
and
here
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
anticipate
the
remarks
of
the
reader
who
in
the
chastity
and
excellency
of
his
conception
may
possibly
exclaim
good
heaven
will
these
authors
never
reform
their
imaginations
and
lift
their
ideas
from
the
obscene
objects
of
low
life
must
the
public
be
again
disgusted
with
the
grovelling
adventures
of
a
waggon
will
no
writer
of
genius
draw
his
pen
in
the
vindication
of
taste
and
entertain
us
with
the
agreeable
characters

dignified

poignant

polite

little
patience
gentle
delicate

critic
you
i
doubt
not
are
one
of
those
consummate
connoisseurs
who
in
their
purifications
let
humour
evaporate
while
they
endeavour
to
preserve
decorum
and
polish
wit
until
the
edge
of
it
is
quite
worn
off
or
perhaps
of
that
class
who
in
the
sapience
of
taste
are
disgusted
with
those
very
flavours
in
the
productions
of
their
own
country
which
have
yielded
infinite
delectation
to
their
faculties
when
imported
from
another
clime

n
an
author
in
despite
of
all
precedent
and
prescription
who
extol
the
writings
of

read
with
rapture
the
amorous
sallies
of

chuckle
over
the
story
of

yet
if
a
modern
author
presumes
to
relate
the
progress
of
a
simple
intrigue
are
shocked
at
the
indecency
and
immorality
of
the
scene
who
delight
in
following
guzman

all
the
mazes
of
squalid
beggary
who
with
pleasure
accompany

paths

occasionally
occurs
in
a
performance
of
our
own
growth
exclaim
with
an
air
of
disgust
was
ever
anything
so
mean
sure
this
writer
must
have
been
very
conversant
with
the
lowest
scenes
of
life
who
when
swift
or
pope
represents
a
coxcomb
in
the
act
of
swearing
scruple
not
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
execrations
but
in
a
less
reputed
author
condemn
the
use
of
such
profane
expletives
who
eagerly
explore
the
jakes
of
rabelais
for
amusement
and
even
extract
humour
from
the
dean
description
of
a
lady
yet
in
a
production
of
these
days
unstamped
with
such
venerable
names
will
stop
their
noses
with
all
the
signs
of
loathing
and
abhorrence
at
a
bare
mention
of
the
china
who
applauded
catullus
juvenal
persius
and
lucan
for
their
spirit
in
lashing
the
greatest
names
of
antiquity
yet
when
a
british
satirist
of
this
generation
has
courage
enough
to
call
in
question
the
talents
of
a
in
power
accuse
him
of
insolence
rancour
and
scurrility

our

with
all
convenient
despatch
be
gradually
sublimed
into
those
splendid
connexions
of
which
you
are
enamoured
and
god
forbid
that
in
the
meantime
the
nature
of
his
extraction
should
turn
to
his
prejudice
in
a
land
of
freedom
like
this
where
individuals
are
every
day
ennobled
in
consequence
of
their
own
qualifications
without
the
least
retrospective
regard
to
the
rank
or
merit
of
their

yes
refined
reader
we
are
hastening
to
that
goal
of
perfection
where
satire
dares
not
show
her
face
where
nature
is
castigated
almost
even
to
still
life
where
humour
turns
changeling
and
slavers
in
an
insipid
grin
where
wit
is
volatilised
into
a
mere
vapour
where
decency
divested
of
all
substance
hovers
about
like
a
fantastic
shadow
where
the
salt
of
genius
escaping
leaves
nothing
but
pure
and
simple
phlegm
and
the
inoffensive
pen
for
ever
drops
the
mild
manna
of
praise
chapter
two
a
superficial
view
of
our
hero
infancy
having
thus
bespoken
the
indulgence
of
our
guests
let
us
now
produce
the
particulars
of
our
entertainment
and
speedily
conduct
our
adventurer
through
the
stage
of
infancy
which
seldom
teems
with
interesting
incidents
as
the
occupations
of
his
mother
would
not
conveniently
permit
her
to
suckle
this
her
firstborn
at
her
own
breast
and
those
happy
ages
were
now
no
more
in
which
the
charge
of
nursing
a
child
might
be
left
to
the
next
goat
or
she
resolved
to
improve
upon
the
ordinances
of
nature
and
foster
him
with
a
juice
much
more
energetic
than
the
milk
of
goat
wolf
or
woman
this
was
no
other
than
that
delicious
nectar
which
as
we
have
already
hinted
she
so
cordially
distributed
from
a
small
cask
that
hung
before
her
depending
from
her
shoulders
by
a
leathern
zone
thus
determined
ere
he
was
yet
twelve
days
old
she
enclosed
him
in
a
canvas
knapsack
which
being
adjusted
to
her
neck
fell
down
upon
her
back
and
balanced
the
cargo
that
rested
on
her
bosom
there
are
not
wanting
those
who
affirm
that
while
her
double
charge
was
carried
about
in
this
situation
her
keg
was
furnished
with
a
long
and
slender
flexible
tube
which
when
the
child
began
to
be
clamorous
she
conveyed
into
his
mouth
and
straight
he
stilled
himself
with
sucking
but
this
we
consider
as
an
extravagant
assertion
of
those
who
mix
the
marvellous
in
all
their
narrations
because
we
can
not
conceive
how
the
tender
organs
of
an
infant
could
digest
such
a
fiery
beverage
which
never
fails
to
discompose
the
constitutions
of
the
most
hardy
and
robust
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
use
of
this
potation
was
more
restrained
and
that
it
was
with
simple
element
diluted
into
a
composition
adapted
to
his
taste
and
years
be
this
as
it
will
he
certainly
was
indulged
in
the
use
of
it
to
such
a
degree
as
would
have
effectually
obstructed
his
future
fortune
had
not
he
been
happily
cloyed
with
the
repetition
of
the
same
fare
for
which
he
conceived
the
utmost
detestation
and
abhorrence
rejecting
it
with
loathing
and
disgust
like
those
choice
spirits
who
having
been
crammed
with
religion
in
their
childhood
renounce
it
in
their
youth
among
other
absurd
prejudices
of
education
while
he
was
thus
dangled
in
a
state
of
suspension
a
german
trooper
was
transiently
smit
with
the
charms
of
his
mother
who
listened
to
his
honourable
addresses
and
once
more
received
the
silken
bonds
of
matrimony
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
as
usual
at
the
the
lady
had
no
sooner
taken
possession
of
her
new
name
than
she
bestowed
it
upon
her
son
who
was
thenceforward
distinguished
by
the
appellation
of
ferdinand
de
fadom
nor
was
the
husband
offended
at
this
presumption
in
his
wife
which
he
not
only
considered
as
a
proof
of
her
affection
and
esteem
but
also
as
a
compliment
by
which
he
might
in
time
acquire
the
credit
of
being
the
real
father
of
such
a
hopeful
child
notwithstanding
this
new
engagement
with
a
foreigner
our
hero
mother
still
exercised
the
virtues
of
her
calling
among
the
english
troops
so
much
was
she
biassed
by
that
laudable
partiality
which
as
horace
observes
the
natale
solum
generally
inspires
indeed
this
inclination
was
enforced
by
another
reason
that
did
not
fail
to
influence
her
conduct
in
this
particular
all
her
knowledge
of
the
high
dutch
language
consisted
in
some
words
of
traffic
absolutely
necessary
for
the
practice
of
hex
vocation
together
with
sundry
oaths
and
terms
of
reproach
that
kept
her
customers
in
awe
so
that
except
among
her
own
countrymen
she
could
not
indulge
that
propensity
to
conversation
for
which
she
had
been
remarkable
from
her
earliest
years
nor
did
this
instance
of
her
affection
fail
of
turning
to
her
account
in
the
sequel
she
was
promoted
to
the
office
of
cook
to
a
regimental
mess
of
officers
and
before
the
peace
of
utrecht
was
actually
in
possession
of
a
pitched
for
the
accommodation
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
army
meanwhile
ferdinand
improved
apace
in
the
accomplishments
of
infancy
his
beauty
was
conspicuous
and
his
vigour
so
uncommon
that
he
was
with
justice
likened
unto
hercules
in
the
cradle
the
friends
of
his
dandled
him
on
their
knees
while
he
played
with
their
whiskers
and
before
he
was
thirteen
months
old
taught
him
to
suck
brandy
impregnated
with
gunpowder
through
the
of
a
pistol
at
the
same
time
he
was
caressed
by
divers
serjeants
of
the
british
army
who
severally
and
in
secret
contemplated
his
qualifications
with
a
father
pride
excited
by
the
artful
declaration
with
which
the
mother
had
flattered
each
apart
soon
as
the
war
was
for
her
unhappily
concluded
she
as
in
duty
bound
followed
her
husband
into
bohemia
and
his
regiment
being
sent
into
garrison
at
prague
she
opened
a
cabaret
in
that
city
which
was
frequented
by
a
good
many
guests
of
the
scotch
and
irish
nations
who
were
devoted
to
the
exercise
of
arms
in
the
service
of
the
emperor
it
was
by
this
communication
that
the
english
tongue
became
vernacular
to
young
ferdinand
who
without
such
opportunity
would
have
been
a
stranger
to
the
language
of
his
forefathers
in
spite
of
all
his
loquacity
and
elocution
though
it
must
be
owned
for
the
credit
of
her
maternal
care
that
she
let
slip
no
occasion
of
making
it
familiar
to
his
ear
and
conception
for
even
at
those
intervals
in
which
she
could
find
no
person
to
carry
on
the
altercation
she
used
to
hold
forth
in
earnest
soliloquies
upon
the
subject
of
her
own
situation
giving
vent
to
many
opprobrious
invectives
against
her
husband
country
between
which
and
old
england
she
drew
many
odious
comparisons
and
prayed
without
ceasing
that
europe
might
speedily
be
involved
in
a
general
war
so
as
that
she
might
have
some
chance
of
the
pleasures
and
emoluments
of
a
flanders
campaign
chapter
three
he
is
initiated
in
a
military
life
and
has
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
a
generous
patron
while
she
wearied
heaven
with
these
petitions
the
flame
of
war
broke
out
betwixt
the
houses
of
ottoman
and
austria
and
the
emperor
sent
forth
an
army
into
hungary
under
the
auspices
of
the
renowned
prince
eugene
on
account
of
this
expedition
the
mother
of
our
hero
gave
up
housekeeping
and
cheerfully
followed
her
customers
and
husband
into
the
field
having
first
provided
herself
with
store
of
those
commodities
in
which
she
had
formerly
merchandised
although
the
hope
of
profit
might
in
some
measure
affect
her
determination
one
of
the
chief
motives
for
her
visiting
the
frontiers
of
turkey
was
the
desire
of
initiating
her
son
in
the
rudiments
of
his
education
which
she
now
thought
high
time
to
inculcate
he
being
at
this
period
in
the
sixth
year
of
his
age
he
was
accordingly
conducted
to
the
camp
which
she
considered
as
the
most
consummate
school
of
life
and
proposed
for
the
scene
of
his
instruction
and
in
this
academy
he
had
not
continued
many
weeks
when
he
was
an
of
that
famous
victory
which
with
sixty
thousand
men
the
imperial
general
obtained
over
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
turks
his
was
engaged
and
his
mother
would
not
be
idle
on
this
occasion
she
was
a
perfect
mistress
of
all
the
camp
qualifications
and
thought
it
a
duty
incumbent
on
her
to
contribute
all
that
lay
in
her
power
towards
distressing
the
enemy
with
these
sentiments
she
hovered
about
the
skirts
of
the
army
and
the
troops
were
no
sooner
employed
in
the
pursuit
than
she
began
to
traverse
the
field
of
battle
with
a
poignard
and
a
bag
in
order
to
consult
her
own
interest
annoy
the
foe
and
exercise
her
humanity
at
the
same
time
in
short
she
had
with
amazing
prowess
delivered
some
fifty
or
threescore
disabled
mussulmen
of
the
pain
under
which
they
groaned
and
made
a
comfortable
booty
of
the
spoils
of
the
slain
when
her
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
rich
attire
of
an
imperial
officer
who
lay
bleeding
on
the
plain
to
all
appearance
in
the
agonies
of
death
she
could
not
in
her
heart
refuse
that
favour
to
a
friend
and
christian
she
had
so
compassionately
bestowed
upon
so
many
enemies
and
infidels
and
therefore
drew
near
with
the
sovereign
remedy
which
she
had
already
administered
with
such
success
as
she
approached
this
deplorable
object
of
pity
her
ears
were
surprised
with
an
ejaculation
in
the
english
tongue
which
he
fervently
pronounced
though
with
a
weak
and
languid
voice
recommending
his
soul
to
god
and
his
family
to
the
protection
of
heaven
our
amazon
purpose
was
staggered
by
this
providential
incident
the
sound
of
her
native
language
so
unexpectedly
heard
and
so
pathetically
delivered
had
a
surprising
effect
upon
her
imagination
and
the
faculty
of
reflection
did
not
forsake
her
in
such
emergency
though
she
could
not
recollect
the
features
of
this
unhappy
officer
she
concluded
from
his
appearance
that
he
was
some
person
of
distinction
in
the
service
and
foresaw
greater
advantage
to
herself
in
attempting
to
preserve
his
life
than
she
could
possibly
reap
from
the
execution
of
her
first
resolve
if
said
she
to
herself
i
can
find
means
of
conveying
him
to
his
tent
alive
he
can
not
but
in
conscience
acknowledge
my
humanity
with
some
considerable
recompense
and
should
he
chance
to
survive
his
wounds
i
have
everything
to
expect
from
his
gratitude
and
fraught
with
these
prudential
suggestions
she
drew
near
the
unfortunate
stranger
and
in
a
softened
accent
of
pity
and
condolence
questioned
him
concerning
his
name
condition
and
the
nature
of
his
mischance
at
the
same
time
making
a
gentle
tender
of
her
service
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
himself
accosted
in
such
a
manner
by
a
person
whose
equipage
seemed
to
promise
far
other
designs
he
thanked
her
in
the
most
grateful
terms
for
her
humanity
with
the
appellation
of
kind
countrywoman
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
was
colonel
of
a
regiment
of
horse
that
he
had
fallen
in
consequence
of
a
shot
he
received
in
his
breast
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
finally
entreated
her
to
procure
some
carriage
on
which
he
might
be
removed
to
his
tent
perceiving
him
faint
and
exhausted
with
loss
of
blood
she
raised
up
his
head
and
treated
him
with
that
cordial
which
was
her
constant
companion
at
that
instant
espying
a
small
body
of
hussars
returning
to
the
camp
with
the
plunder
they
had
taken
she
invoked
their
assistance
and
they
forthwith
carried
the
officer
to
his
own
quarters
where
his
wound
was
dressed
and
his
preserver
carefully
tended
him
until
his
recovery
was
completed
in
return
for
these
good
offices
this
gentleman
who
was
originally
of
scotland
rewarded
her
for
the
present
with
great
liberality
assured
her
of
his
influence
in
promoting
her
husband
and
took
upon
himself
the
charge
of
young
ferdinand
education
the
boy
was
immediately
taken
into
his
protection
and
entered
as
a
trooper
in
his
own
regiment
but
his
good
intentions
towards
his
were
frustrated
by
the
death
of
the
german
who
in
a
few
days
after
this
disposition
was
shot
in
the
trenches
before
temiswaer
this
event
over
and
above
the
conjugal
affliction
with
which
it
invaded
the
lady
quiet
would
have
involved
her
in
infinite
difficulty
and
distress
with
regard
to
her
temporal
concerns
by
leaving
her
unprotected
in
the
midst
of
strangers
had
not
she
been
thus
providentially
supplied
with
an
effectual
patron
in
the
colonel
who
was
known
by
the
appellation
of
count
melvil
he
no
sooner
saw
her
by
the
death
of
her
husband
detached
from
all
personal
connexions
with
a
military
life
than
he
proposed
that
she
should
quit
her
occupation
in
the
camp
and
retire
to
his
habitation
in
the
city
of
presburg
where
she
would
be
entertained
in
ease
and
plenty
during
the
remaining
part
of
her
natural
life
with
all
due
acknowledgments
of
his
generosity
she
begged
to
be
excused
from
embracing
his
proposal
alleging
she
was
so
much
accustomed
to
her
present
way
of
life
and
so
much
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
soldiery
that
she
should
never
be
happy
in
retirement
while
the
troops
of
any
prince
in
christendom
kept
the
field
the
count
finding
her
determined
to
prosecute
her
scheme
repeated
his
promise
of
befriending
her
upon
all
occasions
and
in
the
meantime
admitted
ferdinand
into
the
number
of
his
domestics
resolving
that
he
should
be
brought
up
in
attendance
upon
his
own
son
who
was
a
boy
of
the
same
age
he
kept
him
however
in
his
tent
until
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
revisiting
his
family
in
person
and
before
that
occasion
offered
two
whole
years
elapsed
during
which
the
illustrious
prince
eugene
gained
the
celebrated
battle
of
belgrade
and
afterwards
made
himself
master
of
that
important
frontier
chapter
four
his
mother
prowess
and
death
together
with
some
instances
of
his
own
sagacity
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
mother
of
our
adventurer
such
as
she
hath
been
described
to
sit
quietly
in
her
tent
while
such
an
heroic
scene
was
acting
she
was
no
sooner
apprised
of
the
general
intention
to
attack
the
enemy
than
she
as
usual
packed
up
her
moveables
in
a
waggon
which
she
committed
to
the
care
of
a
peasant
in
the
neighbourhood
and
put
herself
in
motion
with
the
troops
big
with
the
expectation
of
that
part
in
which
she
had
formerly
acquitted
herself
so
much
to
her
nay
she
by
this
time
looked
upon
her
own
presence
as
a
certain
omen
of
success
to
the
cause
which
she
espoused
and
in
their
march
to
battle
actually
encouraged
the
ranks
with
repeated
declarations
importing
that
she
had
been
of
ten
decisive
engagements
in
all
of
which
her
friends
had
been
victorious
and
imputing
such
uncommon
good
fortune
to
some
supernatural
quality
inherent
in
her
person
whether
or
not
this
confidence
contributed
to
the
fortune
of
the
day
by
inspiring
the
soldiers
to
an
uncommon
pitch
of
courage
and
resolution
i
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
but
certain
it
is
the
victory
began
from
that
quarter
in
which
she
had
posted
herself
and
no
corps
in
the
army
behaved
with
such
intrepidity
as
that
which
was
manifested
by
those
who
were
favoured
with
her
admonitions
and
example
for
she
not
only
exposed
her
person
to
the
enemy
fire
with
the
indifference
and
deliberation
of
a
veteran
but
she
is
said
to
have
achieved
a
very
conspicuous
exploit
by
the
prowess
of
her
single
arm
the
extremity
of
the
line
to
which
she
had
attached
herself
being
assaulted
in
flank
by
a
body
of
the
spahis
wheeled
about
in
order
to
sustain
the
charge
and
received
them
with
such
a
seasonable
fire
as
brought
a
great
number
of
turbans
to
the
ground
among
those
who
fell
was
one
of
the
chiefs
or
agas
who
had
advanced
before
the
rest
with
a
view
to
signalise
his
valour
our
english
penthesilea
no
sooner
saw
this
turkish
leader
drop
than
struck
with
the
magnificence
of
his
own
and
horse
trappings
she
sprung
forward
to
seize
them
as
her
prize
and
found
the
aga
not
dead
though
in
a
good
measure
disabled
by
his
misfortune
which
was
entirely
owing
to
the
weight
of
his
horse
that
having
been
killed
by
a
lay
upon
his
leg
so
that
he
could
not
disengage
himself
nevertheless
perceiving
the
virago
approach
with
fell
intent
he
brandished
his
symitar
and
tried
to
intimidate
his
assailant
with
a
most
horrible
exclamation
but
it
was
not
the
dismal
yell
of
a
dismounted
cavalier
though
enforced
with
a
hideous
ferocity
of
countenance
and
the
menacing
gestures
with
which
he
waited
her
approach
that
could
intimidate
such
an
undaunted
she
saw
him
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
a
situation
from
which
he
could
not
move
and
running
towards
him
with
the
nimbleness
and
intrepidity
of
a
camilla
described
a
semicircle
in
the
progress
of
her
assault
and
attacking
him
on
one
side
plunged
her
dagger
in
his
throat
the
shades
of
death
encompassed
him
his
issued
at
the
wound
he
fell
prone
upon
the
earth
he
bit
the
dust
and
having
thrice
invoked
the
name
of
allah
straight
expired
while
his
destiny
was
thus
fulfilled
his
followers
began
to
reel
they
seemed
dismayed
at
the
fate
of
their
chief
beheld
their
companions
drop
like
the
leaves
in
autumn
and
suddenly
halted
in
the
midst
of
their
career
the
imperialists
observing
the
confusion
of
the
enemy
redoubled
their
fire
and
raising
a
dreadful
shout
advanced
in
order
to
improve
the
advantage
they
had
gained
the
spahis
durst
not
wait
the
shock
of
such
an
encounter
they
wheeled
to
the
and
clapping
spurs
to
their
horses
fled
in
the
utmost
disorder
this
was
actually
the
circumstance
that
turned
the
scale
of
battle
the
austrians
pursued
their
good
fortune
with
uncommon
impetuosity
and
in
a
few
minutes
left
the
field
clear
for
the
mother
of
our
hero
who
was
such
an
adept
in
the
art
of
stripping
that
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
bodies
of
the
aga
and
his
arabian
lay
naked
to
the
skin
it
would
have
been
happy
for
her
had
she
been
contented
with
these
reaped
from
the
fortune
of
the
day
and
retired
with
her
spoils
which
were
not
inconsiderable
but
intoxicated
with
the
glory
she
had
won
enticed
by
the
glittering
caparisons
that
lay
scattered
on
the
plain
and
without
doubt
prompted
by
the
secret
instinct
of
her
fate
she
resolved
to
seize
opportunity
by
the
forelock
and
once
for
all
indemnify
herself
for
the
many
fatigues
hazards
and
sorrows
she
had
undergone
thus
determined
she
reconnoitred
the
field
and
practised
her
address
so
successfully
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
was
loaded
with
ermine
and
embroidery
and
disposed
to
retreat
with
her
burden
when
her
regards
were
solicited
by
a
splendid
bundle
which
she
descried
at
some
distance
lying
on
the
ground
this
was
no
other
than
an
unhappy
officer
of
hussars
who
after
having
the
good
fortune
to
take
a
turkish
standard
was
desperately
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
obliged
to
quit
his
horse
finding
himself
in
such
a
helpless
condition
he
had
wrapped
his
acquisition
round
his
body
that
whatever
might
happen
he
and
his
glory
should
not
be
parted
and
thus
shrouded
among
the
dying
and
the
dead
he
had
observed
the
progress
of
our
heroine
who
stalked
about
the
field
like
another
atropos
finishing
wherever
she
came
the
work
of
death
he
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
visited
in
the
course
of
her
peregrinations
and
therefore
provided
for
her
reception
with
a
pistol
ready
cocked
in
his
hand
while
he
lay
perdue
beneath
his
covert
in
all
appearance
bereft
of
life
he
was
not
deceived
in
his
prognostic
she
no
sooner
eyed
the
golden
crescent
than
inflamed
with
curiosity
or
cupidity
she
directed
thitherward
her
steps
and
discerning
the
carcase
of
a
man
from
which
she
thought
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
disengaging
it
she
lifted
up
her
weapon
in
order
to
make
sure
of
her
purchase
and
in
the
very
instant
of
discharging
her
blow
received
a
brace
of
bullets
in
her
brain
thus
ended
the
mortal
pilgrimage
of
this
modern
amazon
who
in
point
of
courage
was
not
inferior
to
semiramis
tomyris
zenobia
thalestris
or
any
boasted
heroine
of
ancient
times
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
this
catastrophe
made
a
very
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
young
ferdinand
who
had
just
then
attained
the
ninth
year
of
his
age
and
been
for
a
considerable
time
weaned
from
her
maternal
caresses
especially
as
he
felt
no
wants
nor
grievances
in
the
family
of
the
count
who
favoured
him
with
a
particular
share
of
indulgence
because
he
perceived
in
him
a
spirit
of
docility
insinuation
and
sagacity
far
above
his
years
he
did
not
however
fail
to
lament
the
untimely
fate
of
his
mother
with
such
filial
expressions
of
sorrow
as
still
more
intimately
recommended
him
to
his
patron
who
being
himself
a
man
of
extraordinary
benevolence
looked
upon
the
boy
as
a
prodigy
of
natural
affection
and
foresaw
in
his
future
services
a
fund
of
gratitude
and
attachment
that
could
not
fail
to
render
him
a
valuable
acquisition
to
his
family
in
his
own
country
he
had
often
seen
connexions
of
that
sort
which
having
been
planted
in
the
infancy
of
the
adherent
had
grown
up
to
a
surprising
pitch
of
fidelity
and
friendship
that
no
temptation
could
bias
and
no
danger
dissolve
he
therefore
rejoiced
in
the
hope
of
seeing
his
own
son
accommodated
with
such
a
faithful
attendant
in
the
person
of
young
fathom
on
whom
he
resolved
to
bestow
the
same
education
he
had
planned
for
the
other
though
conveyed
in
such
a
manner
as
should
be
suitable
to
the
sphere
in
which
he
was
ordained
to
move
in
consequence
of
these
determinations
our
young
adventurer
led
a
very
easy
life
in
quality
of
page
to
the
count
in
whose
tent
he
lay
upon
a
pallet
close
to
his
and
often
diverted
him
with
his
childish
prattle
in
the
english
tongue
which
the
more
seldom
his
master
had
occasion
to
speak
he
the
more
delighted
to
hear
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
the
boy
was
incredibly
assiduous
and
alert
far
from
neglecting
the
little
particulars
of
his
duty
and
embarking
in
the
mischievous
amusements
of
the
children
belonging
to
the
camp
he
was
always
diligent
sedate
agreeably
officious
and
anticipating
and
in
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
seemed
to
express
the
most
vigilant
sense
of
his
goodness
and
generosity
nay
to
such
a
degree
had
these
sentiments
in
all
appearance
operated
upon
his
reflection
that
one
morning
while
he
supposed
the
count
asleep
he
crept
softly
to
his
bedside
and
gently
kissing
his
hand
which
happened
to
be
uncovered
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
a
most
fervent
prayer
in
his
behalf
beseeching
heaven
to
shower
down
blessings
upon
him
as
the
widow
friend
and
the
orphan
father
this
benediction
was
not
lost
upon
the
count
who
chanced
to
be
awake
and
heard
it
with
admiration
but
what
riveted
ferdinand
in
his
good
graces
was
a
discovery
that
our
youth
made
while
his
master
was
upon
duty
in
the
trenches
before
belgrade
two
foot
soldiers
standing
sentry
near
the
door
of
the
tent
were
captivated
with
the
sight
of
some
valuable
moveables
belonging
to
it
and
supposing
in
their
great
wisdom
that
the
city
of
belgrade
was
too
well
fortified
to
be
taken
during
that
campaign
they
came
to
a
resolution
of
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
severe
service
of
the
trenches
by
deserting
to
the
enemy
after
they
should
have
rifled
count
melvil
tent
of
the
furniture
by
which
they
were
so
powerfully
allured
the
particulars
of
this
plan
were
concerted
in
the
french
language
which
they
imagined
would
screen
them
from
all
risk
of
being
detected
in
case
they
should
be
overheard
though
as
there
was
no
living
creature
in
sight
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
person
was
privy
to
their
conversation
nevertheless
they
were
mistaken
in
both
these
conjectures
the
conference
reached
the
ears
of
fathom
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
tent
and
had
perceived
the
eager
looks
with
which
they
considered
some
parts
of
the
furniture
he
had
penetration
enough
to
suspect
their
desire
and
alarmed
by
that
suspicion
listened
attentively
to
their
discourse
which
from
a
slender
knowledge
in
the
french
tongue
he
had
the
good
fortune
partly
to
understand
this
important
piece
of
intelligence
he
communicated
to
the
count
at
his
return
and
measures
were
immediately
taken
to
defeat
the
design
and
make
an
example
of
the
authors
who
being
permitted
to
load
themselves
with
the
booty
were
apprehended
in
their
retreat
and
punished
with
death
according
to
their
demerits
chapter
five
a
brief
detail
of
his
education
nothing
could
have
more
seasonably
happened
to
confirm
the
good
opinion
which
the
colonel
entertained
of
ferdinand
principles
his
intentions
towards
the
boy
grew
every
day
more
and
more
warm
and
immediately
after
the
peace
of
passarowitz
he
retired
to
his
own
house
at
presburg
and
presented
young
fathom
to
his
lady
not
only
as
the
son
of
a
person
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
but
also
as
a
lad
who
merited
his
peculiar
protection
and
regard
by
his
own
personal
virtue
the
countess
who
was
an
hungarian
received
him
with
great
kindness
and
affability
and
her
son
was
ravished
with
the
prospect
of
enjoying
such
a
companion
in
short
fortune
seemed
to
have
provided
for
him
an
asylum
in
which
he
might
be
safely
trained
up
and
suitably
prepared
for
more
important
scenes
of
life
than
any
of
his
ancestors
had
ever
known
he
was
not
in
all
respects
entertained
on
the
footing
of
his
young
master
yet
he
shared
in
all
his
education
and
amusements
as
one
whom
the
old
gentleman
was
fully
determined
to
qualify
for
the
station
of
an
officer
in
the
service
and
if
he
did
not
eat
with
the
count
he
was
every
day
regaled
with
choice
bits
from
his
table
holding
as
it
were
a
middle
place
between
the
rank
of
a
relation
and
favourite
domestic
although
his
patron
maintained
a
tutor
in
the
house
to
superintend
the
conduct
of
his
heir
he
committed
the
charge
of
his
learning
to
the
instructions
of
a
public
school
where
he
imagined
the
boy
would
imbibe
a
laudable
spirit
of
emulation
among
his
fellows
which
could
not
fail
of
turning
out
to
the
advantage
of
his
education
ferdinand
was
entered
in
the
same
academy
and
the
two
lads
proceeded
equally
in
the
paths
of
erudition
a
mutual
friendship
and
intimacy
soon
ensued
and
notwithstanding
the
levity
and
caprice
commonly
discernible
in
the
behaviour
of
such
boys
very
few
or
rather
no
quarrels
happened
in
the
course
of
their
communication
yet
their
dispositions
were
altogether
different
and
their
talents
unlike
nay
this
dissimilarity
was
the
very
bond
of
their
union
because
it
prevented
that
jealousy
and
rivalship
which
often
interrupts
the
harmony
of
two
warm
contemporaries
the
young
count
made
extraordinary
progress
in
the
exercises
of
the
school
though
he
seemed
to
take
very
little
pains
in
the
cultivation
of
his
studies
and
became
a
perfect
hero
in
all
the
athletic
diversions
of
his
but
at
the
same
time
exhibited
such
a
bashful
appearance
and
uncouth
address
that
his
mother
despaired
of
ever
seeing
him
improved
into
any
degree
of
polite
behaviour
on
the
other
hand
fathom
who
was
in
point
of
learning
a
mere
dunce
became
even
in
his
childhood
remarkable
among
the
ladies
for
his
genteel
deportment
and
vivacity
they
admired
the
proficiency
he
made
under
the
directions
of
his
the
air
with
which
he
performed
his
obeisance
at
his
entrance
and
exit
and
were
charmed
with
the
agreeable
assurance
and
lively
sallies
of
his
conversation
while
they
expressed
the
utmost
concern
and
disgust
at
the
boorish
demeanour
of
his
companion
whose
extorted
bows
resembled
the
pawings
of
a
mule
who
hung
his
head
in
silence
like
a
detected
who
sat
in
company
under
the
most
awkward
expressions
of
constraint
and
whose
discourse
never
exceeded
the
simple
monosyllables
of
negation
and
assent
in
vain
did
all
the
females
of
the
family
propose
to
him
young
fathom
as
a
pattern
and
reproach
he
remained
unaltered
by
all
their
efforts
and
expostulations
and
allowed
our
adventurer
to
enjoy
the
triumph
of
his
praise
while
he
himself
was
conscious
of
his
own
superiority
in
those
qualifications
which
seemed
of
more
real
importance
than
the
mere
exteriors
and
forms
of
life
his
present
ambition
was
not
to
make
a
figure
at
his
father
table
but
to
eclipse
his
rivals
at
school
and
to
acquire
an
influence
and
authority
among
these
confederates
nevertheless
fathom
might
possibly
have
fallen
under
his
displeasure
or
contempt
had
not
that
pliant
genius
found
means
to
retain
his
friendship
by
seasonable
compliances
and
submission
for
the
sole
study
or
at
least
the
chief
aim
of
ferdinand
was
to
make
himself
necessary
and
agreeable
to
those
on
whom
his
dependence
was
placed
his
talent
was
in
this
particular
suited
to
his
inclination
he
seemed
to
have
inherited
it
from
his
mother
womb
and
without
all
doubt
would
have
raised
upon
it
a
most
admirable
superstructure
of
fortune
and
applause
had
not
it
been
inseparably
yoked
with
a
most
insidious
principle
of
that
grew
up
with
him
from
the
cradle
and
left
no
room
in
his
heart
for
the
least
particle
of
social
virtue
this
last
however
he
knew
so
well
how
to
counterfeit
by
means
of
a
large
share
of
ductility
and
dissimulation
that
surely
he
was
calculated
by
nature
to
dupe
even
the
most
cautious
and
gratify
his
appetites
by
levying
contributions
on
all
mankind
so
little
are
the
common
instructors
of
youth
qualified
to
judge
the
capacities
of
those
who
are
under
their
tutelage
and
care
that
fathom
by
dint
of
his
insinuating
arts
made
shift
to
pass
upon
the
schoolmaster
as
a
lad
of
quick
parts
in
despite
of
a
natural
inaptitude
to
retain
his
lessons
which
all
his
industry
could
never
overcome
in
order
to
remedy
or
rather
to
cloak
this
defect
in
his
understanding
he
had
always
recourse
to
the
friendship
of
the
young
count
who
freely
permitted
him
to
transcribe
his
exercises
until
a
small
accident
happened
which
had
put
a
stop
to
these
instances
of
his
the
adventure
inconsiderable
as
it
is
we
shall
record
as
the
first
overt
act
of
ferdinand
true
character
as
well
as
an
illustration
of
the
opinion
we
have
advanced
touching
the
blind
and
injudicious
decisions
of
a
right
pedagogue
among
other
tasks
imposed
by
the
pedant
upon
the
form
to
which
our
two
companions
belonged
they
were
one
evening
ordered
to
translate
a
chapter
of
caesar
commentaries
accordingly
the
young
count
went
to
work
and
performed
the
undertaking
with
great
elegance
and
despatch
fathom
having
spent
the
night
in
more
effeminate
amusements
was
next
morning
so
much
hurried
for
want
of
time
that
in
his
transcription
he
neglected
to
insert
a
few
variations
from
the
text
these
being
the
terms
on
which
he
was
allowed
to
use
it
so
that
it
was
verbatim
a
copy
of
the
original
as
those
exercises
were
always
delivered
in
a
heap
subscribed
with
the
several
names
of
the
boys
to
whom
they
belonged
the
schoolmaster
chanced
to
peruse
the
version
of
ferdinand
before
he
looked
into
any
of
the
rest
and
could
not
help
bestowing
upon
it
particular
marks
of
approbation
the
next
that
fell
under
his
examination
was
that
of
the
young
count
when
he
immediately
perceived
the
sameness
and
far
from
imputing
it
to
the
true
cause
upbraided
him
with
having
copied
the
exercise
of
our
adventurer
and
insisted
upon
chastising
him
upon
the
spot
for
his
want
of
application
had
not
the
young
gentleman
thought
his
honour
was
concerned
he
would
have
submitted
to
the
punishment
without
murmuring
but
he
inherited
from
his
parents
the
pride
of
two
fierce
nations
and
being
overwhelmed
with
reproaches
for
that
which
he
imagined
ought
to
have
redounded
to
his
glory
he
could
not
brook
the
indignity
and
boldly
affirmed
that
he
himself
was
the
original
to
whom
ferdinand
was
beholden
for
his
performance
the
schoolmaster
nettled
to
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
judgment
resolved
that
the
count
should
have
no
cause
to
exult
in
the
discovery
he
had
made
and
like
a
true
flogger
actually
whipped
him
for
having
allowed
fathom
to
copy
his
exercise
nay
in
the
hope
of
vindicating
his
own
penetration
he
took
an
opportunity
of
questioning
ferdinand
in
private
concerning
the
circumstances
of
the
translation
and
our
hero
perceiving
his
drift
gave
him
such
artful
and
ambiguous
answers
as
persuaded
him
that
the
young
count
had
acted
the
part
of
a
plagiary
and
that
the
other
had
been
restrained
from
doing
himself
justice
by
the
consideration
of
his
own
dependence
this
profound
director
did
not
fail
in
honour
of
his
own
discernment
to
whisper
about
the
misrepresentation
as
an
instance
of
the
young
insolence
and
fathom
humility
and
good
sense
the
story
was
circulated
among
the
servants
especially
the
maids
belonging
to
the
family
whose
favour
our
hero
had
acquired
by
his
engaging
behaviour
and
at
length
it
reached
the
ears
of
his
patron
who
incensed
at
his
presumption
and
inhospitality
called
him
to
a
severe
account
when
the
young
gentleman
absolutely
denied
the
truth
of
the
allegation
and
appealed
to
the
evidence
of
fathom
himself
our
adventurer
was
accordingly
summoned
by
the
father
and
encouraged
to
declare
the
truth
with
an
assurance
of
his
constant
protection
upon
which
ferdinand
very
wisely
fell
upon
his
knees
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
acquitted
the
young
count
of
the
imputation
and
expressed
his
apprehension
that
the
report
had
been
spread
by
some
of
his
enemies
who
wanted
to
prejudice
him
in
the
opinion
of
his
patron
the
old
gentleman
was
not
satisfied
of
his
son
integrity
by
this
declaration
being
naturally
of
a
generous
disposition
highly
prepossessed
in
favour
of
the
poor
orphan
and
chagrined
at
the
unpromising
appearance
of
his
heir
he
suspected
that
fathom
was
overawed
by
the
fear
of
giving
offence
and
that
notwithstanding
what
he
had
said
the
case
really
stood
as
it
had
been
represented
in
this
persuasion
he
earnestly
exhorted
his
son
to
resist
and
combat
with
any
impulse
he
might
feel
within
himself
tending
to
selfishness
fraud
or
imposition
to
encourage
every
sentiment
of
candour
and
benevolence
and
to
behave
with
moderation
and
affability
to
all
his
he
laid
upon
him
strong
injunctions
not
without
a
mixture
of
threats
to
consider
fathom
as
the
object
of
his
peculiar
regard
to
respect
him
as
the
son
of
the
count
preserver
as
a
briton
a
stranger
and
above
all
an
helpless
orphan
to
whom
the
rights
of
hospitality
were
doubly
due
such
admonitions
were
not
lost
upon
the
youth
who
under
the
rough
husk
of
his
personal
exhibition
possessed
a
large
share
of
generous
sensibility
without
any
formal
professions
to
his
father
he
resolved
to
govern
himself
according
to
his
remonstrances
and
far
from
conceiving
the
least
spark
of
animosity
against
fathom
he
looked
upon
the
poor
boy
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disgrace
and
redoubled
his
kindness
towards
him
that
his
honour
might
never
again
be
called
in
question
upon
the
same
subject
nothing
is
more
liable
to
misconstruction
than
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
one
half
of
the
world
mistake
the
motive
from
want
of
ideas
to
conceive
an
instance
of
beneficence
that
soars
so
high
above
the
level
of
their
own
sentiments
and
the
rest
suspect
it
of
something
sinister
or
selfish
from
the
suggestions
of
their
own
sordid
and
vicious
inclinations
the
young
count
subjected
himself
to
such
misinterpretation
among
those
who
observed
the
increased
warmth
of
civility
and
complaisance
in
his
behaviour
to
ferdinand
they
ascribed
it
to
his
desire
of
still
profiting
by
our
adventurer
superior
talents
by
which
alone
they
supposed
him
enabled
to
maintain
any
degree
of
reputation
at
school
or
to
the
fear
of
being
convicted
by
him
of
some
misdemeanour
of
which
he
knew
himself
guilty
these
suspicions
were
not
effaced
by
the
conduct
of
ferdinand
who
when
examined
on
the
subject
managed
his
answers
in
such
a
manner
as
confirmed
their
conjectures
while
he
pretended
to
refute
them
and
at
the
same
time
acquired
to
himself
credit
for
his
extraordinary
discretion
and
if
he
exhibited
such
a
proof
of
sagacity
in
the
twelfth
year
of
his
age
what
might
not
be
expected
from
his
finesse
in
the
maturity
of
his
faculties
and
experience
thus
secured
in
the
good
graces
of
the
whole
family
he
saw
the
days
of
his
puerility
glide
along
in
the
most
agreeable
elapse
of
caresses
and
amusement
he
never
fairly
plunged
into
the
stream
of
but
by
floating
on
the
surface
imbibed
a
small
tincture
of
those
different
sciences
which
his
master
pretended
to
teach
in
short
he
resembled
those
vagrant
swallows
that
skim
along
the
level
of
some
pool
or
river
without
venturing
to
wet
one
feather
in
their
wings
except
in
the
accidental
pursuit
of
an
inconsiderable
fly
yet
though
his
capacity
or
inclination
was
unsuited
for
studies
of
this
kind
he
did
not
fail
to
manifest
a
perfect
genius
in
the
acquisition
of
other
more
profitable
arts
over
and
above
the
accomplishments
of

for
which
he
hath
been
already
celebrated

began
even
at
these
years
to
understand
the
moves
and
schemes
of

and
made
himself
a
mere
adept
in
the
mystery
of
cards
which
he
learned
in
the
course
of
his
assiduities
and
attention
to

it
was
in

that
he
attracted

and
friendship
of

daughter
a
girl
by
two
years
older
than
himself
who
was
not
insensible
to
his
qualifications
and
looked
upon
him
with
the
most
favourable
eyes
of
prepossession
whether
or
not
he
at
this
period
of
his
life
began
to
project
plans
for
availing
himself
of
her
susceptibility
is
uncertain
but
without
all
doubt
he
cultivated
her
esteem
with
as
obsequious
and
submissive
attention
as
if
he
had
already
formed
the
design
which
in
his
advanced
age
he
attempted
to
put
in
execution
divers
circumstances
conspired
to
promote

in
the
favour
of
this
young
lady
the
greenness
of
his
years
secured
him
from
any
appearance
of
fallacious
aim
so
that
he
was
indulged
in
frequent
opportunities
of
conversing
with
his
young
mistress
whose
parents
encouraged
this
communication
by
which
they
hoped
she
would
improve
in

the

of
her
father
such

his
talents
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
those
parties
and
his
manners
so
engaging
that
there
would
have
been
no
just
subject
for
wonder
had
he
made
an
impression
upon
the
tender
unexperienced
heart
of
mademoiselle
de
melvil
whose
beauty
was
not
so
attractive
as
to
extinguish
his
hope
in
raising
up
a
number
of
formidable
rivals
though
her
expectations
of
fortune
were
such
as
commonly
lend
additional
lustre
to
personal
merit
all
these
considerations
were
so
many
steps
towards
the
success
of
ferdinand
pretensions
and
though
he
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
perceived
them
at
first
he
in
the
sequel
seemed
perfectly
well
apprised
of
his
advantages
and
used
them
to
the
full
extent
of
his
faculties
observing
that
she
delighted
in
music
he
betook
himself
to
the
study
of
that
art
and
by
dint
of
application
and
a
tolerable
ear
learned
of
himself
to
accompany
her
with
a
german
flute
while
she
sung
and
played
upon
the
harpsichord
the
count
seeing
his
inclination
and
the
progress
he
had
made
resolved
that
his
capacity
should
not
be
lost
for
want
of
cultivation
and
accordingly
provided
him
with
a
master
by
whom
he
was
instructed
in
the
principles
of
the
art
and
soon
became
a
proficient
in
playing
upon
the
violin
in
the
practice
of
these
improvements
and
avocations
and
in
attendance
upon
his
young
master
whom
he
took
care
never
to
disoblige
or
neglect
he
attained
to
the
age
of
sixteen
without
feeling
the
least
abatement
in
the
friendship
and
generosity
of
those
upon
whom
he
depended
but
on
the
contrary
receiving
every
day
fresh
marks
of
their
bounty
and
regard
he
had
before
this
time
been
smit
with
the
ambition
of
making
a
conquest
of
the
young
lady
heart
and
foresaw
manifold
advantages
to
himself
in
becoming
to
count
melvil
who
he
never
doubted
would
soon
be
reconciled
to
the
match
if
once
it
could
be
effectuated
without
his
knowledge
although
he
thought
he
had
great
reason
to
believe
that
mademoiselle
looked
upon
him
with
an
eye
of
peculiar
favour
his
disposition
was
happily
tempered
with
an
ingredient
of
caution
that
hindered
him
from
acting
with
precipitation
and
he
had
discerned
in
the
young
lady
deportment
certain
indications
of
loftiness
and
pride
which
kept
him
in
the
utmost
vigilance
and
circumspection
for
he
knew
that
by
a
premature
declaration
he
should
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
all
the
advantages
he
had
gained
and
blasting
those
expectations
that
now
blossomed
so
gaily
in
his
heart
restricted
by
these
reflections
he
acted
at
a
wary
distance
and
determined
to
proceed
by
the
method
of
sap
and
summoning
all
his
artifice
and
attractions
to
his
aid
employed
them
under
the
insidious
cover
of
profound
respect
in
order
to
undermine
those
bulwarks
of
haughtiness
or
discretion
which
otherwise
might
have
rendered
his
approaches
to
her
impracticable
with
a
view
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
company
and
sound
her
sentiments
at
the
same
time
he
became
more
reserved
than
usual
and
seldomer
engaged
in
her
parties
of
music
and
cards
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
reserve
he
never
failed
in
those
demonstrations
of
reverence
and
regard
which
he
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
express
but
devised
such
excuses
for
his
absence
as
she
could
not
help
admitting
in
consequence
of
this
affected
shyness
she
more
than
once
gently
chid
him
for
his
neglect
and
indifference
observing
with
an
ironical
air
that
he
was
now
too
much
of
a
man
to
be
entertained
with
such
effeminate
diversions
but
her
reproofs
were
pronounced
with
too
much
ease
and
to
be
agreeable
to
our
hero
who
desired
to
see
her
ruffled
and
chagrined
at
his
absence
and
to
hear
himself
rebuked
with
an
angry
affectation
of
disdain
this
effort
therefore
he
reinforced
with
the
most
captivating
carriage
he
could
assume
in
those
hours
which
he
now
so
sparingly
bestowed
upon
his
mistress
he
regaled
her
with
all
the
entertaining
stories
he
could
learn
or
invent
particularly
such
as
he
thought
would
justify
and
recommend
the
levelling
power
of
love
that
knows
no
distinctions
of
fortune
he
sung
nothing
but
tender
airs
and
passionate
complaints
composed
by
desponding
or
despairing
swains
and
to
render
his
performances
of
this
kind
the
more
pathetic
interlarded
them
with
some
seasonable
sighs
while
the
tears
which
he
had
ever
at
command
stood
collected
in
either
eye
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
overlook
such
studied
emotions
she
in
a
jocose
manner
taxed
him
with
having
lost
his
heart
rallied
the
excess
of
his
passion
and
in
a
merry
strain
undertook
to
be
an
advocate
for
his
love
her
behaviour
was
still
wide
of
his
wish
and
expectation
he
thought
she
would
in
consequence
of
her
discovery
have
betrayed
some
interested
symptom
that
her
face
would
have
undergone
some
favourable
suffusion
that
her
tongue
would
have
faltered
her
breast
heaved
and
her
whole
deportment
betokened
internal
agitation
and
disorder
in
which
case
he
meant
to
profit
by
the
happy
impression
and
declare
himself
before
she
could
possibly
recollect
the
dictates
of
her
baffled
however
in
his
endeavours
by
the
serenity
of
the
young
lady
which
he
still
deemed
equivocal
he
had
recourse
to
another
experiment
by
which
he
believed
he
should
make
a
discovery
of
her
sentiments
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
one
day
while
he
accompanied
mademoiselle
in
her
exercise
of
music
he
pretended
all
of
a
sudden
to
be
taken
ill
and
counterfeited
a
swoon
in
her
apartment
surprised
at
this
accident
she
screamed
aloud
but
far
from
running
to
his
assistance
with
the
transports
and
distraction
of
a
lover
she
ordered
her
maid
who
was
present
to
support
his
head
and
went
in
person
to
call
for
more
help
he
was
accordingly
removed
to
his
own
chamber
where
willing
to
be
still
more
certified
of
her
inclinations
he
prolonged
the
farce
and
lay
groaning
under
the
pretence
of
a
severe
fever
the
whole
family
was
alarmed
upon
this
occasion
for
as
we
have
already
observed
he
was
an
universal
favourite
he
was
immediately
visited
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
who
expressed
the
utmost
concern
at
his
distemper
ordered
him
to
be
carefully
attended
and
sent
for
a
physician
without
loss
of
time
the
young
gentleman
would
scarce
stir
from
his
bedside
where
he
ministered
unto
him
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
brotherly
affection
and
miss
exhorted
him
to
keep
up
his
spirits
with
many
expressions
of
unreserved
sympathy
and
regard
nevertheless
he
saw
nothing
in
her
behaviour
but
what
might
be
naturally
expected
from
common
friendship
and
a
compassionate
disposition
and
was
very
much
mortified
at
his
disappointment
whether
the
miscarriage
actually
affected
his
constitution
or
the
doctor
happened
to
be
mistaken
in
his
diagnostics
we
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
but
the
patient
was
certainly
treated
secundum
artem
and
all
his
complaints
in
a
little
time
realised
for
the
physician
like
a
true
graduate
had
an
eye
to
the
apothecary
in
his
prescriptions
and
such
was
the
concern
and
scrupulous
care
with
which
our
hero
was
attended
that
the
orders
of
the
faculty
were
performed
with
the
utmost
punctuality

well
skilled

occupation
as
any
other
leeches

sun
and
swallowed
a
whole
dispensary
of
bolusses
draughts
and
apozems
by
which
means
he
became
fairly
delirious
in
three
days
and
so
untractable
that
he
could
be
no
longer
managed

to
rule
otherwise
in
all
likelihood
the
world
would
never
have
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
these
adventures
in

his
constitution
though
unable
to
cope
with
two
such
formidable
antagonists
as
the
doctor
and
the
disease
he
had
conjured
up
was
no
sooner
rid
of
the
one
than
it
easily
got
the
better
of
the
other
and
though
ferdinand
after
all
found
his
grand
aim
unaccomplished
his
malady
was
productive
of
a
consequence
which
though
he
had
not
foreseen
it
he
did
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
use
and
advantage

long
sighed
in

attract

admiration

ensnare

loves

faculties
were
employed
upon
the
plan
which
he
had
already
projected
that
was
the
goal
of
his
whole
attention
to
which
all
his
measures
tended

or
not

perceived

he
had
made
upon
teresa
he
never
gave
her
the
least
reason
to
believe
he
was
conscious
of
his
victory
until
he
found
himself
baffled
in
his
design
upon
the
heart
of
her
she
therefore
persevered
in
her
distant
attempts
to
allure
him
with
the
usual
coquetries
of
dress
and
address
and
in
the
sweet
hope
of
profiting
by
his
susceptibility
made
shift
to
suppress
her
feelings
and
keep
her
passion
within
bounds
until
his
supposed
danger
alarmed
her
fears
and
raised
such
a
tumult
within
her
breast
that
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
love
but
gave
a
loose
to
her
sorrow
in
the
most
immoderate
expressions
of
anguish
and
affliction
and
while
his
delirium
lasted
behaved
with
all
the
agitation
of
a
despairing
shepherdess
ferdinand
was
or
pretended
to
be
the
last
person
in
the
family
who
understood
the
situation
of
her
thoughts
when
he
perceived
her
passion
he
entered
into
deliberation
with
himself
and
tasked
his
reflection
and
foresight
in
order
to
discover
how
best
he
might
convert
this
conquest
to
his
own
advantage
here
then
that
we
may
neglect
no
opportunity
of
doing
justice
to
our
hero
it
will
be
proper
to
observe
that
howsoever
unapt
his
understanding
might
be
to
receive
and
retain
the
usual
culture
of
the
schools
he
was
naturally
a
genius
in
point
of
sagacity
and
he
dived
into
the
characters
of
mankind
with
a
penetration
peculiar
to
himself
and
had
he
been
admitted
as
a
pupil
in
any
political
academy
would
have
certainly
become
one
of
the
ablest
statesmen
in
europe
having
revolved
all
the
probable
consequences
of
such
a
connexion
he
determined
to
prosecute
an
amour
with
the
lady
whose
affection
he
had
subdued
because
he
hoped
to
interest
her
as
an
auxiliary
in
his
grand
scheme
upon
mademoiselle
which
he
did
not
as
yet
think
proper
to
lay
aside
for
he
was
not
more
ambitious
in
the
plan
than
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
it
he
knew
it
would
be
impossible
to
execute
his
aims
upon
the
count
daughter
under
the
eye
of
teresa
whose
natural
discernment
would
be
whetted
with
jealousy
and
who
would
watch
his
conduct
and
thwart
his
progress
with
all
the
vigilance
and
spite
of
a
slighted
maiden
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
doubt
of
being
able
to
bring
her
over
to
his
interest
by
the
influence
he
had
already
gained
or
might
afterwards
acquire
over
her
passions
in
which
case
she
would
effectually
espouse
his
cause
and
employ
her
good
offices
with
her
mistress
in
his
behalf
besides
he
was
induced
by
another
motive
which
though
secondary
did
not
fail
in
this
case
to
have
an
effect
upon
his
determination
he
looked
upon
teresa
with
the
eyes
of
appetite
which
he
longed
to
gratify
for
he
was
not
at
all
dead
to
the
instigations
of
the
flesh
though
he
had
philosophy
enough
to
resist
them
when
he
thought
they
interfered
with
his
interest
here
the
case
was
quite
different
his
desire
happened
to
be
upon
the
side
of
his
advantage
and
therefore
resolving
to
indulge
it
he
no
sooner
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
manage
such
an
adventure
than
he
began
to
make
gradual
advances
in
point
of
warmth
and
particular
complacency
to
the
maid
he
first
of
all
thanked
her
in
the
most
grateful
terms
for
the
concern
she
had
manifested
at
his
distemper
and
the
kind
services
he
had
received
from
her
during
the
course
of
it
he
treated
her
upon
all
occasions
with
unusual
affability
and
regard
assiduously
courted
her
acquaintance
and
conversation
and
contracted
an
intimacy
that
in
a
little
time
produced
a
declaration
of
love
although
her
heart
was
too
much
intendered
to
hold
out
against
all
the
forms
of
assault
far
from
yielding
at
discretion
she
stood
upon
honourable
terms
with
great
obstinacy
of
punctilio
and
while
she
owned
he
was
master
of
her
inclinations
gave
him
to
understand
with
a
peremptory
and
resolute
air
that
he
should
never
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
observing
that
if
the
passion
he
professed
was
genuine
he
would
not
scruple
to
give
such
a
proof
of
it
as
would
at
once
convince
her
of
his
sincerity
and
that
he
could
have
no
just
cause
to
refuse
her
that
satisfaction
she
being
his
equal
in
point
of
birth
and
situation
for
if
he
was
the
companion
and
favourite
of
the
young
count
she
was
the
friend
and
confidant
of
mademoiselle
he
acknowledged
the
strength
of
her
argument
and
that
her
condescension
was
greater
than
his
deserts
but
objected
against
the
proposal
as
infinitely
prejudicial
to
the
fortunes
of
them
both
he
represented
the
state
of
dependence
in
which
they
mutually
stood
their
utter
incapacity
to
support
one
another
under
the
consequences
of
a
precipitate
match
clandestinely
made
without
the
consent
and
concurrence
of
their
patrons
he
displayed
with
great
eloquence
all
those
gay
expectations
they
had
reason
to
entertain
from
that
eminent
degree
of
favour
which
they
had
already
secured
in
the
family
and
set
forth
in
the
most
alluring
colours
those
enchanting
scenes
of
pleasure
they
might
enjoy
in
each
other
without
that
disagreeable
consciousness
of
a
nuptial
chain
provided
she
would
be
his
associate
in
the
execution
of
a
plan
which
he
had
projected
for
their
reciprocal
convenience
having
thus
inflamed
her
love
of
pleasure
and
curiosity
he
with
great
caution
hinted
his
design
upon
the
young
lady
fortune
and
perceiving
her
listening
with
the
most
greedy
attention
and
perfectly
ripe
for
the
conspiracy
he
disclosed
his
intention
at
full
length
assuring
her
with
the
most
solemn
protestations
of
love
and
attachment
that
could
he
once
make
himself
legal
possessor
of
an
estate
which
mademoiselle
inherited
by
the
will
of
a
deceased
aunt
his
dear
teresa
should
reap
the
happy
fruits
of
his
affluence
and
wholly
engross
his
time
and
attention
such
a
base
declaration
our
hero
would
not
have
ventured
to
make
had
he
not
implicitly
believed
the
damsel
was
as
great
a
latitudinarian
as
himself
in
point
of
morals
and
principle
and
been
well
assured
that
though
he
should
be
mistaken
in
her
way
of
thinking
so
far
as
to
be
threatened
with
a
detection
of
his
purpose
he
would
always
have
it
in
his
power
to
refute
her
accusation
as
mere
calumny
by
the
character
he
had
hitherto
maintained
and
the
circumspection
of
his
future
conduct
he
seldom
or
never
erred
in
his
observations
on
the
human
heart
teresa
instead
of
disapproving
relished
the
plan
in
general
with
demonstrations
of
singular
satisfaction
she
at
once
conceived
all
the
advantageous
consequences
of
such
a
scheme
and
perceived
in
it
only
one
flaw
which
however
she
did
not
think
incurable
this
defect
was
no
other
than
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
by
which
they
might
be
effectually
tied
down
to
their
mutual
interest
she
foresaw
that
in
case
ferdinand
should
obtain
possession
of
the
prize
he
might
with
great
ease
deny
their
contract
and
disavow
her
claim
of
participation
she
therefore
demanded
security
and
proposed
as
a
preliminary
of
the
agreement
that
he
should
privately
take
her
to
wife
with
a
view
to
dispel
all
her
apprehensions
of
his
inconstancy
or
deceit
as
such
a
previous
engagement
would
be
a
check
upon
his
behaviour
and
keep
him
strictly
to
the
letter
of
their
contract
he
could
not
help
subscribing
to
the
righteousness
of
this
proposal
which
nevertheless
he
would
have
willingly
waived
on
the
supposition
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
joined
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
with
such
secrecy
as
the
nature
of
the
case
absolutely
required
this
would
have
been
a
difficulty
soon
removed
had
the
scene
of
the
transaction
been
laid
in
the
metropolis
of
england
where
passengers
are
plied
in
the
streets
by
clergymen
who
prostitute
their
characters
and
consciences
for
hire
in
defiance
of
all
decency
and
law
but
in
the
kingdom
of
hungary
ecclesiastics
are
more
scrupulous
in
the
exercise
of
their
function
and
the
objection
was
or
supposed
to
be
altogether
insurmountable
so
that
they
were
fain
to
have
recourse
to
an
expedient
with
which
after
some
hesitation
our
was
satisfied
they
joined
hands
in
the
sight
of
heaven
which
they
called
to
witness
and
to
judge
the
sincerity
of
their
vows
and
engaged
in
a
voluntary
oath
to
confirm
their
union
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
whenever
a
convenient
opportunity
for
so
doing
should
occur
the
scruples
of
teresa
being
thus
removed
she
admitted
ferdinand
to
the
privileges
of
a
husband
which
he
enjoyed
in
stolen
interviews
and
readily
undertook
to
exert
her
whole
power
in
promoting
his
suit
with
her
young
mistress
because
she
now
considered
his
interest
as
inseparably
connected
with
her
own
surely
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
or
preposterous
than
the
articles
of
this
covenant
which
she
insisted
upon
with
such
inflexibility
how
could
she
suppose
that
her
pretended
lover
would
be
restrained
by
an
oath
when
the
very
occasion
of
incurring
it
was
an
intention
to
act
in
violation
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
and
yet
such
ridiculous
conjuration
is
commonly
the
cement
of
every
conspiracy
how
dark
how
treacherous
how
impious
soever
it
may
be
a
certain
sign
that
there
are
some
remains
of
religion
left
in
the
human
mind
even
after
every
moral
sentiment
hath
abandoned
it
and
that
the
most
execrable
ruffian
finds
means
to
quiet
the
suggestions
of
his
conscience
by
some
reversionary
hope
of
heaven

it

our
lovers

real

the
first
transports
of

enjoyment

not

the
great
political
aim
of
their
conjunction
teresa
bedchamber
to
which
our
hero
constantly
repaired
at
midnight
was
the
scene
of
their
deliberations
and
there
it
was
determined
that
the
damsel
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
should
feign
herself
irritated
at
the
indifference
of
ferdinand
her
passion
for
whom
was
by
this
time
no
secret
in
the
family
and
that
with
a
view
to
countenance
this
affectation
he
should
upon
all
occasions
treat
her
with
an
air
of
loftiness
and
disdain
so
screened
from
all
imputation
of
fraud
she
was
furnished
by
him
with
artful
instructions
how
to
sound
the
inclinations
of
her
young
mistress
how
to
recommend
his
person
and
qualifications
by
the
sure
methods
of
contradiction
comparisons
revilings
and
reproach
how
to
watch
the
paroxysms
of
her
disposition
inflame
her
passions
and
improve
for
his
advantage
those
moments
of
frailty
from
which
no
woman
is
exempted
in
short
this
consummate
politician
taught
his
agent
to
poison
the
young
lady
mind
with
insidious
conversation
tending
to
inspire
her
with
the
love
of
guilty
pleasure
to
debauch
her
sentiments
and
confound
her
ideas
of
dignity
and
virtue
after
all
the
task
is
not
difficult
to
lead
the
unpractised
heart
astray
by
dint
of
those
opportunities
her
seducer
possessed
the
seeds
of
insinuation
seasonably
sown
upon
the
warm
luxuriant
soil
of
youth
could
hardly
fail
of
shooting
up
into
such
intemperate
desires
as
he
wanted
to
produce
especially
when
cultured
and
cherished
in
her
unguarded
hours
by
that
stimulating
discourse
which
familiarity
admits
and
the
looser
passions
ingrafted
in
every
breast
are
apt
to
relish
and
excuse
fathom
had
previously
reconnoitred
the
ground
and
discovered
some
marks
of
inflammability
in
mademoiselle
constitution
her
beauty
was
not
such
as
to
engage
her
in
those
gaieties
of
amusement
which
could
flatter
her
vanity
and
dissipate
her
ideas
and
she
was
of
an
age
when
the
little
loves
and
young
desires
take
possession
of
the
fancy
he
therefore
concluded
that
she
had
the
more
leisure
to
indulge
these
enticing
images
of
pleasure
that
youth
never
fails
to
create
particularly
in
those
who
like
her
were
addicted
to
solitude
and
study
teresa
full
fraught
with
the
wily
injunctions
of
her
confederate
took
the
field
and
opened
the
campaign
with
such
remarkable
sourness
in
her
aspect
when
ferdinand
appeared
that
her
young
lady
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
her
affected
chagrin
and
asked
the
reason
of
such
apparent
alteration
in
her
way
of
thinking
prepared
for
this
question
the
other
replied
in
a
manner
calculated
for
giving
mademoiselle
to
understand
that
whatever
impressions
ferdinand
might
have
formerly
made
on
her
heart
they
were
now
altogether
effaced
by
the
pride
and
insolence
with
which
he
had
received
her
advances
and
that
her
breast
now
glowed
with
all
the
revenge
of
a
slighted
lover
to
evince
the
sincerity
of
this
declaration
she
bitterly
inveighed
against
him
and
even
affected
to
depreciate
those
talents
in
which
she
knew
his
chief
merit
to
consist
hoping
by
these
means
to
interest
mademoiselle
candour
in
his
defence
so
far
the
train
succeeded
that
young
lady
love
for
truth
was
offended
at
the
calumnies
that
were
vented
against
ferdinand
in
his
absence
she
chid
her
woman
for
the
rancour
of
her
remarks
and
undertook
to
refute
the
articles
of
his
dispraise
teresa
supported
her
own
assertions
with
great
obstinacy
and
a
dispute
ensued
in
which
her
mistress
was
heated
into
some
extravagant
commendations
of
our
adventurer
his
supposed
enemy
did
not
fail
to
make
a
report
of
her
success
and
to
magnify
every
advantage
they
had
gained
believing
in
good
earnest
that
her
lady
warmth
was
the
effect
of
a
real
passion
for
the
fortunate
fathom
but
he
himself
viewed
the
adventure
in
a
different
light
and
rightly
imputed
the
violence
of
mademoiselle
behaviour
to
the
contradiction
she
had
sustained
from
her
maid
or
to
the
fire
of
her
natural
generosity
glowing
in
behalf
of
innocence
traduced
nevertheless
he
was
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
nature
of
the
contest
because
in
the
course
of
such
debates
he
foresaw
that
he
should
become
habitually
her
hero
and
that
in
time
she
would
actually
believe
those
exaggerations
of
his
merit
which
she
herself
had
feigned
for
the
honour
of
her
own
arguments
this
presage
founded
upon
that
principle
of
without
which
no
individual
exists
may
certainly
be
justified
by
manifold
occurrences
in
life
we
ourselves
have
known
a
very
pregnant
example
which
we
shall
relate
for
the
emolument
of
the
reader
a
certain
needy
author
having
found
means
to
present
a
manuscript
to
one
of
those
sons
of
fortune
who
are
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
patrons
instead
of
reaping
that
applause
and
advantage
with
which
he
had
regaled
his
fancy
had
the
mortification
to
find
his
performance
treated
with
infinite
irreverence
and
contempt
and
in
high
dudgeon
and
disappointment
appealed
to
the
judgment
of
another
critic
who
he
knew
had
no
veneration
for
the
first
this
common
consolation
to
which
all
baffled
authors
have
recourse
was
productive
of
very
happy
consequences
to
our
bard
for
though
the
opinions
of
both
judges
concerning
the
piece
were
altogether
the
same
the
latter
either
out
of
compassion
to
the
appellant
or
desire
of
rendering
his
rival
ridiculous
in
the
eye
of
taste
undertook
to
repair
the
misfortune
and
in
this
manner
executed
the
plan
in
a
meeting
of
literati
to
which
both
these
wits
belonged
he
who
had
espoused
the
poet
cause
having
previously
desired
another
member
to
bring
his
composition
on
the
carpet
no
sooner
heard
it
mentioned
than
he
began
to
censure
it
with
flagrant
marks
of
scorn
and
with
an
ironical
air
looking
at
its
first
condemner
observed
that
he
must
be
furiously
infected
with
the
rage
of
patronising
who
could
take
such
a
deplorable
performance
into
his
protection
the
sarcasm
took
effect
the
person
against
whom
it
was
levelled
taking
umbrage
at
his
presumption
assumed
an
aspect
of
disdain
and
replied
with
great
animosity
that
nothing
was
more
easily
supported
than
the
character
of
a
zoilus
because
no
production
was
altogether
free
from
blemishes
and
any
man
might
pronounce
against
any
piece
by
the
lump
without
interesting
his
own
discernment
but
to
perceive
the
beauties
of
a
work
it
was
requisite
to
have
learning
judgment
and
taste
and
therefore
he
did
not
wonder
that
the
gentleman
had
overlooked
a
great
many
in
the
composition
which
he
so
contemptuously
decried
a
rejoinder
succeeded
this
reply
and
produced
a
long
train
of
altercation
in
which
the
gentleman
who
had
formerly
treated
the
book
with
such
disrespect
now
professed
himself
its
passionate
admirer
and
held
forth
in
praise
of
it
with
great
warmth
and
elocution
not
contented
with
having
exhibited
this
instance
of
regard
he
next
morning
sent
a
message
to
the
owner
importing
that
he
had
but
superficially
glanced
over
the
manuscript
and
desiring
the
favour
of
perusing
it
a
second
time
being
indulged
in
this
request
he
recommended
it
in
terms
of
rapture
to
all
his
friends
and
dependants
and
by
dint
of
unwearied
solicitation
procured
a
very
ample
subscription
for
the
author
but
to
resume
the
thread
of
our
story
teresa
practices
were
not
confined
to
simple
defamation
her
reproaches
were
contrived
so
as
to
imply
some
intelligence
in
favour
of
the
person
she
reviled
in
exemplifying
his
pertness
and
arrogance
she
repeated
his
witty
repartee
on
pretence
of
blaming
his
ferocity
she
recounted
proofs
of
his
spirit
and
prowess
and
in
explaining
the
source
of
his
vanity
gave
her
mistress
to
understand
that
a
certain
young
lady
of
fashion
was
said
to
be
enamoured
of
his
person
nor
did
this
understrapper
omit
those
other
parts
of
her
cue
which
the
principal
judged
necessary
for
the
furtherance
of
his
scheme
her
conversation
became
less
guarded
and
took
a
freer
turn
than
usual
she
seized
all
opportunities
of
introducing
little
amorous
stories
the
greatest
part
of
which
were
invented
for
the
purposes
of
warming
her
passions
and
lowering
the
price
of
chastity
in
her
esteem
for
she
represented
all
the
young
contemporaries
in
point
of
age
and
situation
as
so
many
sensualists
who
without
scruple
indulged
themselves
in
the
stolen
pleasures
of
youth
meanwhile
ferdinand
seconded
these
endeavours
with
his
whole
industry
and
address
he
redoubled
if
possible
his
deference
and
respect
whetting
his
assiduity
to
the
keenest
edge
of
attention
and
in
short
regulated
his
dress
conversation
and
deportment
according
to
the
fancy
turn
and
prevailing
humour
of
his
young
mistress
he
moreover
attempted
to
profit
by
her
curiosity
which
he
knew
to
be
truly
feminine
and
having
culled
from
the
library
of
his
patron
certain
dangerous
books
calculated
to
debauch
the
minds
of
young
people
left
them
occasionally
upon
the
table
in
his
apartment
after
having
directed
teresa
to
pick
them
up
as
if
by
accident
in
his
absence
and
carry
them
off
for
the
entertainment
of
mademoiselle
nay
this
crafty
projector
found
means
to
furnish
his
associate
with
some
mischievous
preparations
which
were
mingled
in
her
chocolate
tea
or
coffee
as
provocations
to
warm
her
constitution
yet
all
these
machinations
ingenious
as
they
were
failed
not
only
in
fulfilling
their
aim
but
even
in
shaking
the
foundations
of
her
virtue
or
pride
which
stood
their
assaults
unmoved
like
a
strong
tower
built
upon
a
rock
impregnable
to
all
the
tempestuous
blasts
of
heaven
not
but
that
the
conspirators
were
more
than
once
mistaken
in
the
effects
of
their
artifices
and
disposed
to
applaud
themselves
on
the
progress
they
had
made
when
at
any
time
she
expressed
a
desire
to
examine
those
performances
which
were
laid
before
her
as
snares
to
entrap
her
chastity
they
attributed
that
which
was
no
other
than
curiosity
to
a
looseness
of
sentiment
and
when
she
discovered
no
aversion
to
hear
those
anecdotes
concerning
the
frailty
of
her
neighbours
they
imputed
to
abatement
of
chastity
that
satisfaction
which
was
the
result
of
on
her
own
superior
virtue
so
far
did
the
treacherous
accomplice
of
fathom
presume
upon
these
misconstructions
that
she
at
length
divested
her
tongue
of
all
restraint
and
behaved
in
such
a
manner
that
the
young
lady
confounded
and
incensed
at
her
indecency
and
impudence
rebuked
her
with
great
severity
and
commanded
her
to
reform
her
discourse
on
pain
of
being
dismissed
with
disgrace
from
her
service
chapter
nine
the
confederates
change
their
battery
and
achieve
a
remarkable
adventure
thunderstruck
at
this
disappointment
the
confederates
held
a
council
in
order
to
deliberate
upon
the
next
measures
that
should
be
taken
and
ferdinand
for
the
present
despairing
of
accomplishing
his
grand
aim
resolved
to
profit
in
another
manner
by
the
conveniency
of
his
situation
he
represented
to
his
helpmate
that
it
would
be
prudent
for
them
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
as
their
connexion
might
be
sooner
or
later
discovered
and
an
end
put
to
all
those
opportunities
which
they
now
so
happily
enjoyed
all
principles
of
morality
had
been
already
excluded
from
their
former
plan
consequently
he
found
it
an
easy
task
to
interest
teresa
in
any
other
scheme
tending
to
their
mutual
advantage
howsoever
wicked
and
perfidious
it
might
be
he
therefore
persuaded
her
to
be
his
auxiliary
in
defrauding
mademoiselle
at
play
and
gave
her
suitable
directions
for
that
purpose
and
even
tutored
her
how
to
abuse
the
trust
reposed
in
her
by
embezzling
the
young
lady
effects
without
incurring
the
suspicion
of
dishonesty
on
the
supposition
that
every
servant
in
the
house
was
not
able
to
resist
such
temptation
the
purse
of
her
mistress
to
which
the
maid
had
always
access
was
dropped
in
a
passage
which
the
domestics
had
occasion
to
frequent
and
fathom
posted
himself
in
a
convenient
place
in
order
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
stratagem
here
he
was
not
disappointed
in
his
conjecture
the
first
person
who
chanced
to
pass
that
way
was
one
of
the
chambermaids
with
whom
teresa
had
lived
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
inveterate
enmity
because
the
wench
had
failed
in
that
homage
and
respect
which
was
paid
to
her
by
the
rest
of
the
servants
ferdinand
had
in
his
heart
espoused
the
quarrel
of
his
associate
and
longed
for
an
occasion
to
deliver
her
from
the
malicious
observance
of
such
an
antagonist
when
he
therefore
saw
her
approach
his
heart
throbbed
with
joyful
expectations
but
when
she
snatched
up
the
purse
and
thrust
it
in
her
bosom
with
all
the
eagerness
and
confusion
of
one
determined
to
appropriate
the
windfall
to
her
own
use
his
transports
were
altogether
unspeakable
he
traced
her
to
her
own
apartment
whither
she
immediately
retreated
with
great
trepidation
and
then
communicated
the
discovery
to
teresa
together
with
instructions
how
to
behave
in
the
sequel
in
conformity
with
these
lessons
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
going
to
mademoiselle
and
demanding
money
for
some
necessary
expense
that
the
loss
might
be
known
before
the
finder
could
have
leisure
to
make
any
fresh
conveyance
of
the
prize
and
in
the
meantime
ferdinand
kept
a
strict
eye
upon
the
motions
of
the
chambermaid
the
young
lady
having
rummaged
her
pockets
in
vain
expressed
some
surprise
at
the
loss
of
her
purse
upon
which
her
attendant
gave
indications
of
extreme
amazement
and
concern
she
said
it
could
not
possibly
be
lost
entreated
her
to
search
her
escritoir
while
she
herself
ran
about
the
room
prying
into
every
corner
with
all
the
symptoms
of
fear
and
distraction
having
made
this
unsuccessful
inquiry
she
pretended
to
shed
a
flood
of
tears
bewailing
her
own
fate
in
being
near
the
person
of
any
lady
who
met
with
such
a
misfortune
by
which
she
observed
her
character
might
be
called
in
question
she
produced
her
own
keys
and
begged
upon
her
knees
that
her
chamber
and
boxes
might
be
searched
without
delay
in
a
word
she
demeaned
herself
so
artfully
upon
this
occasion
that
her
mistress
who
never
entertained
the
least
doubt
of
her
integrity
now
looked
upon
her
as
a
miracle
of
fidelity
and
attachment
and
was
at
infinite
pains
to
console
her
for
the
accident
which
had
happened
protesting
that
for
her
own
part
the
loss
of
the
money
should
never
affect
her
with
a
moment
uneasiness
if
she
could
retrieve
a
certain
medal
which
she
had
long
kept
in
her
purse
as
a
remembrance
of
her
deceased
aunt
from
whom
she
received
it
in
a
present
fathom
entered
accidentally
into
the
midst
of
this
scene
and
perceiving
the
agitation
of
the
maid
and
the
concern
of
the
mistress
desired
in
a
respectful
manner
to
know
the
cause
of
their
disorder
before
the
young
lady
had
time
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
the
case
his
accomplice
exclaimed
in
an
affected
passion
mr
fathom
my
lady
has
lost
her
purse
and
as
no
persons
in
the
family
are
so
much
about
her
as
you
and
i
you
must
give
me
leave
in
my
own
justification
to
insist
upon
mademoiselle
ordering
the
apartments
of
us
both
to
be
searched
without
loss
of
time
here
are
my
pockets
and
my
keys
and
you
can
not
scruple
to
give
her
the
same
satisfaction
for
innocence
has
nothing
to
miss
melvil
reprimanded
her
sharply
for
her
unmannerly
zeal
and
ferdinand
eyeing
her
with
a
look
of
disdain
madam
said
he
i
approve
of
your
proposal
but
before
i
undergo
such
mortification
i
would
advise
mademoiselle
to
subject
the
two
chambermaids
to
such
inquiry
as
they
also
have
access
to
the
apartments
and
are
i
apprehend
as
likely
as
you
or
i
to
behave
in
such
a
scandalous
the
young
lady
declared
that
she
was
too
well
satisfied
of
honesty
and
ferdinand
honour
to
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
either
and
that
she
would
sooner
die
than
disgrace
them
so
far
as
to
comply
with
the
proposal
the
former
had
made
but
as
she
saw
no
reason
for
exempting
the
inferior
servants
from
that
examination
which
fathom
advised
she
would
forthwith
put
it
in
execution
the
chambermaids
being
accordingly
summoned
she
calmly
asked
if
either
of
them
had
accidentally
found
the
purse
she
had
dropped
and
both
replying
in
the
negative
she
assumed
an
air
of
severity
and
determination
and
demanding
their
keys
threatened
to
examine
their
trunks
on
the
instant
the
guilty
abigail
who
though
an
hungarian
was
not
inferior
in
point
of
effrontery
to
any
one
of
the
sisterhood
in
england
no
sooner
heard
this
menace
than
she
affected
an
air
of
affronted
innocence
thanked
god
she
had
lived
in
many
reputable
families
and
been
trusted
with
untold
gold
but
was
never
before
suspected
of
theft
that
the
other
maid
might
do
as
she
should
think
proper
and
be
enough
to
let
her
things
be
tumbled
and
exposed
but
for
her
own
part
if
she
should
be
used
in
that
inhuman
and
disgraceful
manner
she
would
not
stay
another
hour
in
the
house
and
in
conclusion
said
that
mademoiselle
had
more
reason
to
look
sharp
after
those
who
enjoyed
the
greatest
share
of
her
favour
than
believe
their
malicious
insinuations
against
innocent
people
whom
they
were
well
known
to
hate
and
defame
this
declaration
implying
an
hint
to
the
prejudice
of
teresa
far
from
diverting
miss
melvil
from
her
purpose
served
only
to
enhance
the
character
of
the
accused
in
her
opinion
and
to
confirm
her
suspicion
of
the
accuser
of
whom
she
again
demanded
her
keys
protesting
that
should
she
prove
refractory
the
count
himself
should
take
cognisance
of
the
affair
whereas
if
she
would
deal
ingenuously
she
should
have
no
cause
to
repent
of
her
confession
so
saying
she
desired
our
adventurer
to
take
the
trouble
of
calling
up
some
of
the
upon
which
the
conscious
criminal
began
to
tremble
and
falling
upon
her
knees
acknowledged
her
guilt
and
implored
the
forgiveness
of
her
young
mistress
teresa
seizing
this
occasion
to
signalise
her
generosity
joined
in
the
request
and
the
offender
was
pardoned
after
having
restored
the
purse
and
promised
in
the
sight
of
heaven
that
the
devil
should
never
again
entice
her
to
the
commission
of
such
a
crime
this
adventure
fully
answered
all
the
purposes
of
our
politician
it
established
the
opinion
of
his
virtue
beyond
the
power
of
accident
or
information
to
shake
and
set
up
a
false
beacon
to
mislead
the
sentiments
of
mademoiselle
in
case
she
should
for
the
future
meet
with
the
like

the

was
overwhelmed
with
consternation
and
with
the
appearance
of
extreme
chagrin
demanded
her
dismission
affirming
that
these
things
were
certainly
effected
by
some
person
in

with
a
view

murdering

a

of

vanished
when
teresa
could
no
longer
keep
her
affliction
within
bounds
indeed
this
was
an
event
of
more
consequence
than
all
the
rest
which
had
happened
for
the
jewels
were
valued
at
five
hundred
florins
mademoiselle
was
accordingly
alarmed
to
such
a
degree
that
she
made
her
mother
acquainted
with
her
loss
and
that
good
lady
who
was
an
excellent
economist
did
not
fail
to
give
indications
of
extraordinary
concern
she
asked
if
her
daughter
had
reason
to
suspect
any
individual
in
the
family
and
if
she
was
perfectly
confident
of
her
own
woman
integrity
upon
which
mademoiselle
with
many
encomiums
on
the
fidelity
and
attachment
of
teresa
recounted
the
adventure
of
the
chambermaid
who
immediately
underwent
a
strict
inquiry
and
was
even
committed
to
prison
on
the
strength
of
her
former
misdemeanour
our
adventurer
mate
insisted
upon
undergoing
the
same
trial
with
the
rest
of
the
domestics
and
as
usual
comprehended
fathom
in
her
insinuations
while
he
seconded
the
proposal
and
privately
counselled
the
old
lady
to
introduce
teresa
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
by
these
preconcerted
recriminations
they
escaped
all
suspicion
of
collusion
after
a
fruitless
inquiry
the
prisoner
was
discharged
from
her
confinement
and
turned
out
of
the
service
of
the
count
in
whose
private
opinion
the
character
of
no
person
suffered
so
much
as
that
of
his
own
son
whom
he
suspected
of
having
embezzled
the
jewels
for
the
use
of
a
certain
inamorata
who
at
that
time
was
said
to
have
captivated
his
affections
the
old
gentleman
felt
upon
this
occasion
all
that
internal
anguish
which
a
man
of
honour
may
be
supposed
to
suffer
on
account
of
a
degeneracy
and
without
divulging
his
sentiments
or
even
hinting
his
suspicions
to
the
youth
himself
determined
to
detach
him
at
once
from
such
dangerous
connexions
by
sending
him
forthwith
to
vienna
on
pretence
of
finishing
his
exercises
at
the
academy
and
ushering
him
into
acquaintance
with
the
great
world
though
he
would
not
be
thought
by
the
young
gentleman
himself
to
harbour
the
least
doubt
of
his
morals
he
did
not
scruple
to
unbosom
himself
on
that
subject
to
ferdinand
whose
sagacity
and
virtue
he
held
in
great
veneration
this
indulgent
patron
expressed
himself
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
on
the
untoward
disposition
of
his
son
he
told
fathom
that
he
should
accompany

that
was
the
youth
name
not
only
as
a
companion
but
a
preceptor
and
pattern
conjured
him
to
assist
his
tutor
in
superintending
his
conduct
and
to
reinforce
the
governor
precepts
by
his
own
example
to
inculcate
upon
him
the
most
delicate
punctilios
of
honour
and
decoy
him
into
extravagance
rather
than
leave
the
least
illiberal
sentiment
in
his
heart
our
crafty
adventurer
with
demonstrations
of
the
utmost
sensibility
acknowledged
the
great
goodness
of
the
count
in
reposing
such
confidence
in
his
integrity
which
as
he
observed
none
but
the
worst
of
villains
could
abuse
and
fervently
wished
that
he
might
no
longer
exist
than
he
should
continue
to
remember
and
resent
the
obligations
he
owed
to
his
kind
benefactor
while
preparations
were
making
for
their
departure
our
hero
held
a
council
with
his
associate
whom
he
enriched
with
many
sage
instructions
touching
her
future
operations
he
at
the
same
time
disburdened
her
of
all
or
the
greatest
part
of
the
spoils
she
had
won
and
after
having
received
divers
marks
of
bounty
from
the
count
and
his
lady
together
with
a
purse
from
his
young
mistress
he
set
out
for
vienna
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
age
with
renaldo
and
his
governor
who
were
provided
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
some
of
the
friends
belonging
to
the
imperial
court
such
a
favourable
introduction
could
not
fail
of
being
advantageous
to
a
youth
of
ferdinand
specious
accomplishments
for
he
was
considered
as
the
young
count
companion
admitted
into
his
parties
and
included
in
all
the
entertainments
to
which
renaldo
was
invited
he
soon
distinguished
himself
by
his
activity
and
address
in
the
course
of
those
exercises
that
were
taught
at
the
academy
of
which
he
was
pupil
his
manners
were
so
engaging
as
to
attract
the
acquaintance
of
his
and
his
conversation
being
sprightly
and
inoffensive
grew
into
very
great
request
in
a
word
he
and
the
young
count
formed
a
remarkable
contrast
which
in
the
eye
of
the
world
redounded
to
his
advantage
they
were
certainly
in
all
respects
the
reverse
of
each
other
renaldo
under
a
total
defect
of
exterior
cultivation
possessed
a
most
excellent
understanding
with
every
virtue
that
dignifies
the
human
heart
while
the
other
beneath
a
most
agreeable
outside
with
an
inaptitude
and
aversion
to
letters
concealed
an
amazing
fund
of
villany
and
ingratitude
hitherto
his
observation
had
been
confined
to
a
narrow
sphere
and
his
reflections
though
surprisingly
just
and
acute
had
not
attained
to
that
maturity
which
age
and
experience
give
but
now
his
perceptions
began
to
be
more
distinct
and
extended
to
a
thousand
objects
which
had
never
before
come
under
his
cognisance
he
had
formerly
imagined
but
was
now
fully
persuaded
that
the
sons
of
men
preyed
upon
one
another
and
such
was
the
end
and
condition
of
their
being
among
the
principal
figures
of
life
he
observed
few
or
no
characters
that
did
not
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
savage
tyrants
of
the
wood
one
resembled
a
tiger
in
fury
and
rapaciousness
a
second
prowled
about
like
an
hungry
wolf
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
a
third
acted
the
part
of
a
jackal
in
beating
the
bush
for
game
to
his
voracious
employer
and
the
fourth
imitated
the
wily
fox
in
practising
a
thousand
crafty
ambuscades
for
the
destruction
of
the
ignorant
and
unwary
this
last
was
the
department
of
life
for
which
he
found
himself
best
qualified
by
nature
and
inclination
and
he
accordingly
resolved
that
his
talent
should
not
rust
in
his
possession
he
was
already
pretty
well
versed
in
all
the
sciences
of
play
but
he
had
every
day
occasion
to
see
these
arts
carried
to
such
a
surprising
pitch
of
finesse
and
dexterity
as
discouraged
him
from
building
his
schemes
on
that
foundation
he
therefore
determined
to
fascinate
the
judgment
rather
than
the
eyes
of
his
by
a
continual
exercise
of
that
gift
of
deceiving
with
which
he
knew
himself
endued
to
an
unrivalled
degree
and
to
acquire
unbounded
influence
with
those
who
might
be
subservient
to
his
interest
by
an
assiduous
application
to
their
prevailing
passions
not
that
play
was
altogether
left
out
in
the
projection
of
his
though
he
engaged
himself
very
little
in
the
executive
part
of
gaming
he
had
not
been
long
in
vienna
when
he
entered
into
league
with
a
genius
of
that
kind
whom
he
distinguished
among
the
pupils
of
the
academy
and
who
indeed
had
taken
up
his
habitation
in
that
place
with
a
view
to
pillage
the
provincials
on
their
first
arrival
in
town
before
they
could
be
armed
with
proper
circumspection
to
preserve
their
money
or
have
time
to
dispose
of
it
in
any
other
shape
similar
characters
naturally
attract
each
other
and
people
of
our
principles
are
of
all
others
the
most
apt
to
distinguish
their
own
likeness
wheresoever
it
occurs
because
they
always
keep
the
faculty
of
discerning
in
full
exertion
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
mutual
alertness
that
ferdinand
and
the
stranger
who
was
a
native
of
tyrol
perceived
themselves
reflected
in
the
dispositions
of
each
other
and
immediately
entered
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance

the
articles
of

and
counsel

they
began
to
hunt

and

order
to

by
the
alliance

a
good
grace

night
intoxicated

course

which

purposely
absented
himself
was
by
the
tyrolese
so
artfully
provoked
to
play
that
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
but
engaged
at
passdice
with
that
fell
adversary
who
in
less
than
an
hour
stripped
him
of
a
pretty
round
sum
next
day
when
the
young
gentleman
recovered
the
use
of
his
reflection
he
was
sensibly
chagrined
at
the
folly
and
precipitation
of
his
own
conduct
an
account
of
which
he
communicated
in
confidence
to
our
hero
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
shame
and
concern
ferdinand
having
moralised
upon
the
subject
with
great
sagacity
and
sharply
inveighed
against
the
tyrolese
for
the
unfair
advantage
he
had
taken
retired
to
his
closet
and
wrote
the
following
billet
which
was
immediately
sent
to
his
ally
the
obligations
i
owe
and
the
attachments

feel
to
the
count
de
melvil
will
not
suffer
me
to
be
an
idle
spectator
of
the
wrongs
offered
to
his
son
in
the
dishonourable
use
i
understand
you
made
last
night
of
his
unguarded
hours
i
therefore
insist
upon
your
making
immediate
restitution
of
the
booty
which
you
so
unjustly
got
otherwise
i
expect
you
will
meet
me
upon
the
ramparts
near
the
bastion
de
la
port
neuve
morning
at
daybreak
in
order
to
justify
with
your
sword
the
finesse
you
have
practised
upon
the
friend
of
ferdinand
de
the
gamester
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
than
according
to
the
plan
which
had
been
preconcerted
betwixt
the
author
and
him
he
went
to
the
apartment
of
renaldo
and
presenting
the
sum
of
money
which
he
had
defrauded
him
of
the
preceding
night
told
him
with
a
stern
countenance
that
though
it
was
a
just
acquisition
he
scorned
to
avail
himself
of
his
good
fortune
against
any
person
who
entertained
the
smallest
doubt
of
his
honour
the
young
count
surprised
at
this
address
rejected
his
offer
with
disdain
and
desired
to
know
the
meaning
of
such
an
unexpected
declaration
upon
which
the
other
produced
ferdinand
billet
and
threatened
in
very
high
terms
to
meet
the
stripling
according
to
his
invitation
and
chastise
him
severely
for
his
presumption
the
consequence
of
this
explanation
is
obvious
renaldo
imputing
the
officiousness
of
fathom
to
the
zeal
of
his
friendship
interposed
in
the
quarrel
which
was
amicably
compromised
not
a
little
to
the
honour
of
our
adventurer
who
thus
obtained
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
courage
and
integrity
without
the
least
hazard
to
his
person
while
at
the
same
time
his
confederate
recommended
himself
to
the
esteem
of
the
young
count
by
his
spirited
behaviour
on
this
occasion
so
that
renaldo
being
less
shy
of
his
company
for
the
future
the
tyrolese
had
the
fairer
opportunities
to
prosecute
his
designs
upon
the
young
gentleman
purse
it
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
these
were
not
neglected
the
son
of
count
melvil
was
not
deficient
in
point
of
penetration
but
his
whole
study
was
at
that
time
engrossed
by
the
care
of
his
education
and
he
had
sometimes
recourse
to
play
as
an
amusement
by
which
he
sought
to
unbend
the
severity
of
his
attention
no
wonder
then
that
he
fell
a
prey
to
an
artful
gamester
who
had
been
regularly
trained
to
the
profession
and
made
it
the
sole
study
of
his
life
especially
as
the
hungarian
was
remarkable
for
a
warmth
of
temper
which
a
knight
of
the
post
always
knows
how
to
manage
for
his
own
advantage
in
the
course
of
these
operations
fathom
was
a
very
useful
correspondent
he
instructed
the
tyrolese
in
the
peculiarities
of
renaldo
disposition
and
made
him
acquainted
with
the
proper
seasons
for
profiting
by
his
dexterity
ferdinand
for
example
who
by
the
authority
derived
to
him
from
the
injunctions
of
the
old
count
sometimes
took
upon
himself
the
office
of
an
adviser
cunningly
chose
to
counsel
the
son
at
those
conjunctures
when
he
knew
him
least
able
to
bear
such
expostulation
advice
improperly
administered
generally
acts
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
given
at
least
this
was
the
case
with
the
young
gentleman
who
inflamed
by
the
reproof
of
such
a
tutor
used
to
obey
the
dictates
of
his
resentment
in
an
immediate
repetition
of
that
conduct
which
our
adventurer
had
taken
the
liberty
to
disapprove
and
the
gamester
was
always
at
hand
to
minister
unto
his
indignation
by
these
means
he
was
disencumbered
of
divers
considerable
remittances
with
which
his
father
cheerfully
supplied
him
on
the
supposition
that
they
were
spent
with
taste
and
liberality
under
the
direction
of
our
adventurer
but
ferdinand
views
were
not
confined
to
the
narrow
field
of
this
alliance
he
attempted
divers
enterprises
in
the
world
of
gallantry
conscious
of
his
own
personal
qualifications
and
never
doubting
that
he
could
insinuate
himself
into
the
good
graces
of
some
married
lady
about
court
or
lay
an
opulent
dowager
under
contribution
but
he
met
with
an
obstacle
in
his
endeavours
of
this
kind
which
all
his
art
was
unable
to
surmount
this
was
no
other
than
the
obscurity
of
his
birth
and
the
want
of
a
title
without
which
no
person
in
that
country
lays
claim
to
the
privileges
of
a
gentleman
had
he
foreseen
this
inconvenience
he
might
have
made
shift
to
obviate
the
consequences
by
obtaining
permission
to
appear
in
the
character
of
the
count
kinsman
though
in
all
probability
such
an
expedient
would
not
have
been
extremely
agreeable
to
the
old
gentleman
who
was
very
tenacious
of
the
honour
of
his
family
nevertheless
his
generosity
might
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
indulge
fathom
with
such
a
pretext
in
consideration
of
the
supposed
attachment
and
the
obligations
for
which
he
deemed
himself
indebted
to
his
deceased
mother
true
it
is
ferdinand
upon
his
first
arrival
at
vienna
had
been
admitted
into
fashionable
company
on
the
footing
of
renaldo
companion
because
nobody
suspected
the
defect
of
his
pedigree
and
even
after
a
report
had
been
circulated
to
the
prejudice
of
his
extraction
by
the
industry
of
a
lacquey
who
attended
the
young
count
there
were
not
wanting
many
young
people
of
distinction
who
still
favoured
him
with
their
countenance
and
correspondence
but
he
was
no
longer
invited
to
private
families
in
which
only
he
could
expect
to
profit
by
his
address
among
the
ladies
and
had
the
mortification
of
finding
himself
frequently
excepted
from
parties
which
were
expressly
calculated
for
the
entertainment
of
the
young
count
luckily
his
spirit
was
so
pliant
as
to
sustain
these
slights
without
being
much
dejected
instead
of
repining
at
the
loss
of
that
respect
which
had
been
paid
to
him
at
first
he
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
preserve
the
little
that
still
remained
and
resolved
to
translate
into
a
humbler
sphere
that
gallantry
which
he
had
no
longer
opportunities
of
displaying
in
the
world
of
rank
and
fashion

of

of
this
determination
he
to
the
uttermost
exerted

among
the
few
friends
of
consequence
his
fortune
had
left
and
even
carried
his
complaisance
so
far
as
to
become
the
humble
servant
of
their
pleasures
while
he
attempted
to
extend
his
acquaintance
in
an
inferior
path
of
life
where
he
thought
his
talents
would
shine
more
conspicuous
than
at
the
assemblies
of
the
great
and
conduce
more
effectually
to
the
interest
of
all
his
designs
nor
did
he
find
himself
disappointed
in
that
expectation
sanguine
as
it
was
he
soon
found
means
to
be
introduced
to
the
house
of
a
wealthy
bourgeois
where
every
individual
was
charmed
with
his
easy
air
and
extraordinary
qualifications
he
accommodated
himself
surprisingly
to

humours
of
the
whole

and
discoursed
of
stones
with
the
husband
who
was
a
rich
jeweller
sacrificed
himself
to
the
pride
and
loquacity
of
the
wife
and
played
upon
the
violin
and
sung
alternately
for
the
amusement
of
his
only
daughter
a
buxom
lass
nearly
of
his
own
age
the
fruit
of
a
former
marriage
it
was
not
long
before
ferdinand
had
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
this
society
he
had
expected
to
find
and
in
a
little
time
actually
discovered
that
mutual
jealousy
and
rancour
which
almost
always
subsist
between
a
daughter
and
her
inflamed
with
all
the
virulence
of
female
emulation
for
the
disparity
in
their
ages
served
only
to
render
them
the
more
inveterate
rivals
in
the
desire
of
captivating
the
other
sex
our
adventurer
having
deliberated
upon
the
means
of
converting
this
animosity
to
his
own
advantage
saw
no
method
for
this
purpose
so
feasible
as
that
of
making
his
approaches
to
the
hearts
of
both
by
ministering
to
each
in
private
food
for
their
reciprocal
envy
and
malevolence
because
he
well
knew
that
no
road
lies
so
direct
and
open
to
a
woman
heart
as
that
of
gratifying
her
passions
of
vanity
and
resentment
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
being
particular
with
the
mother
he
expressed
his
concern
for
having
unwittingly
incurred
the
displeasure
of
mademoiselle
which
he
observed
was
obvious
in
every
circumstance
of
her
behaviour
towards
him
protesting
he
was
utterly
innocent
of
all
intention
of
offending
her
and
that
he
could
not
account
for
his
disgrace
any
other
way
than
by
supposing
she
took
umbrage
at
the
direction
of
his
chief
regards
towards
her
which
he
owned
was
altogether
involuntary
being
wholly
influenced
by
that
superior
charms
and
politeness
such
a
declaration
was
perfectly
well
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
a
dame
like
her
who
with
all
the
intoxications
of
unenlightened
pride
and
an
increased
appetite
for
pleasure
had
begun
to
find
herself
neglected
and
even
to
believe
that
her
attractions
were
actually
on
the
wane
she
very
graciously
consoled
our
gallant
for
the
mishap
of
which
he
complained
representing
wilhelmina
that
was
the
daughter
name
as
a
pert
illiterate
envious
baggage
of
whose
disgust
he
ought
to
make
no
consideration
then
she
recounted
many
instances
of
her
own
generosity
to
that
young
lady
with
the
returns
of
malice
and
ingratitude
she
had
made
and
lastly
enumerated
all
the
imperfections
of
her
person
education
and
behaviour
that
he
might
see
with
what
justice
the
gypsy
pretended
to
vie
with
those
who
had
been
distinguished
by
the
approbation
and
even
gallantry
of
the
best
people
in
vienna
having
thus
established
himself
her
confidant
and
gossip
he
knew
his
next
step
of
promotion
would
necessarily
be
to
the
degree
of
her
lover
and
in
that
belief
resolved
to
play
the
same
game
with
mademoiselle
wilhelmina
whose
complexion
was
very
much
akin
to
that
of
her
stepmother
indeed
they
resembled
each
other
too
much
to
live
upon
any
terms
of
friendship
or
even
decorum
fathom
in
order
to
enjoy
a
private
conversation
with
the
young
lady
never
failed
to
repeat
his
visit
every
afternoon
till
at
length
he
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
her
disengaged
the
jeweller
being
occupied
among
his
workmen
and
his
wife
gone
to
assist
at
a
our
adventurer
and
the
daughter
had
already
exchanged
their
vows
by
the
expressive
language
of
the
eyes
he
had
even
declared
himself
in
some
tender
ejaculations
which
had
been
softly
whispered
in
her
ear
when
he
could
snatch
an
opportunity
of
venting
them
unperceived
nay
he
had
upon
divers
occasions
gently
squeezed
her
fair
hand
on
pretence
of
tuning
her
harpsichord
and
been
favoured
with
returns
of
the
same
cordial
pressure
so
that
instead
of
accosting
her
with
the
fearful
hesitation
and
reserve
of
a
timid
swain
he
told
her
after
the
exercise
of
the
that
he
was
come
to
confer
with
her
upon
a
subject
that
nearly
concerned
her
peace
and
asked
if
she
had
not
observed
of
late
an
evident
abatement
of
friendship
in
her
mother
behaviour
to
him
whom
she
had
formerly
treated
with
such
marks
of
favour
and
respect
mademoiselle
would
not
pay
so
ill
a
compliment
to
her
own
discernment
as
to
say
she
had
not
perceived
the
alteration
which
on
the
contrary
she
owned
was
extremely
palpable
nor
was
it
difficult
to
divine
the
cause
of
such
estranged
looks
this
remark
was
accompanied
with
an
irresistible
glance
she
smiled
enchanting
the
colour
deepened
on
her
cheeks
her
breast
began
to
heave
and
her
whole
frame
underwent
a
most
agreeable
confusion
ferdinand
was
not
a
man
to
let
such
a
favourable
conjuncture
pass
unregarded
yes
charming
wilhelmina
exclaimed
the
politician
in
an
affected
rapture
the
cause
is
as
conspicuous
as
your
attractions
she
hath
in
spite
of
all
my
circumspection
perceived
that
passion
which
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
conceal
and
in
consequence
of
which
i
now
declare
myself
your
devoted
adorer
or
conscious
of
your
superior
excellence
her
jealousy
hath
taken
the
alarm
and
though
stung
with
conjecture
only
repines
at
the
triumph
of
your
perfections
how
far
this
spirit
of
malignity
may
be
inflamed
to
my
prejudice
i
know
not
perhaps
as
this
is
the
first
it
may
be
also
the
last
opportunity
i
shall
have
of
avowing
the
dearest
sentiments
of
my
heart
to
the
fair
object
that
inspired
them
in
a
word
i
may
be
for
ever
excluded
from
your
presence
excuse
me
then
divine
creature
from
the
practice
of
those
unnecessary
forms
which
i
should
take
pride
in
observing
were
i
indulged
with
the
ordinary
privileges
of
an
honourable
lover
and
once
for
all
accept
the
homage
of
an
heart
overflowing
with
love
and
admiration
yes
adorable
wilhelmina
i
am
dazzled
with
your
supernatural
beauty
your
other
accomplishments
strike
me
with
wonder
and
awe
i
am
enchanted
by
the
graces
of
your
deportment
ravished
with
the
charms
of
your
conversation
and
there
is
a
certain
tenderness
of
benevolence
in
that
endearing
aspect
which
i
trust
will
not
fail
to
melt
with
sympathy
at
the
emotions
of
a
faithful
slave
like
so
saying
he
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
and
seizing
her
plump
hand
pressed
it
to
his
lips
with
all
the
violence
of
real
transport
the
nymph
whose
passions
nature
had
filled
to
the
brim
could
not
hear
such
a
rhapsody
unmoved
being
an
utter
stranger
to
addresses
of
this
kind
she
understood
every
word
of
it
in
the
literal
acceptation
she
believed
implicitly
in
the
truth
of
the
encomiums
he
had
bestowed
and
thought
it
reasonable
he
should
be
rewarded
for
the
justice
he
had
done
to
her
qualifications
which
had
hitherto
been
almost
altogether
overlooked
in
short
her
heart
began
to
thaw
and
her
face
to
hang
out
the
flag
of
capitulation
which
was
no
sooner
perceived
by
our
hero
than
he
renewed
his
attack
with
redoubled
fervour
pronouncing
in
a
most
vehement
tone
light
of
my
eyes
and
empress
of
my
soul
behold
me
prostrate
at
your
feet
waiting
with
the
most
pious
resignation
for
that
sentence
from
your
lips
on
which
my
future
happiness
or
misery
must
altogether
depend
not
with
more
reverence

the
last
sighs
of
a

this
faithful

the
last
office

its
unfortunate

shed
the
blood
of
the
truest
heart
that
ever

the
cruel

by

excellent

began
to
sob
most
piteously

wilhelmina
unable
longer
to
withstand
his
moving
tale
with
a
repetition
of
the
interjection

gently
dropped
into
his
arms
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
correspondence
that
soon
rose
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
and
they
forthwith
concerted
measures
for
carrying
it
on
without
the
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
her
nevertheless
the
young
lady
vanquished
as
she
was
and
unskilled
in
the
ways
of
men
would
not
all
at
once
yield
at
discretion
but
insisted
upon
those
terms
without
which
no
woman
reputation
can
be
secured
our
lover
far
from
seeking
to
evade
the
proposal
assented
to
it
in
terms
of
uncommon
satisfaction
and
promised
to
use
his
whole
industry
in
finding
a
priest
upon
whose
discretion
they
could
rely
nay
he
certainly
resolved
to
comply
with
her
request
in
good
earnest
rather
than
forfeit
the
advantages
which
he
foresaw
in
their
union
his
good
fortune
however
exempted
him
from
the
necessity
of
taking
such
a
step
which
at
best
must
have
been
disagreeable
for
so
many
difficulties
occurred
in
the
inquiry
which
was
set
on
foot
and
so
artfully
did
fathom
in
the
meantime
manage
the
influence
he
had
already
gained
over
her
heart
that
before
her
passion
could
obtain
a
legal
gratification
she
surrendered
to
his
wish
without
any
other
assurance
than
his
solemn
profession
of
sincerity
and
truth
on
which
she
reposed
herself

the
most
implicit
confidence

faith

exposed
to
a
most
perilous
incident
in
the
course
of
his
intrigue
with
the
daughter
he
was
rejoiced
to
find
her
so
easily
satisfied
in
such
a
momentous
concern
for
the
principal
aim
of
the
intrigue
was
to
make
her
necessary
to
his
interested
views
and
even
if
possible
an
associate
in
the
fraudulent
plans
he
had
projected
upon
her
father
consequently
he
considered
this
relaxation
in
her
virtue
as
an
happy
omen
of
his
future
success
all
the
obstacles
to
their
mutual
enjoyment
being
thus
removed
our
adventurer
was
by
his
mistress
indulged
with
an
assignation
in
her
own
chamber
which
though
contiguous
to
that
of
her
stepmother
was
provided
with
a
door
that
opened
into
a
common
staircase
to
which
he
had
access
at
all
hours
of
the
night
he
did
not
neglect
the
rendezvous
but
presenting
himself
at
the
appointed
time
which
was
midnight
made
the
signal
they
had
agreed
upon
and
was
immediately
admitted
by

lover

was
not
deficient
in
those
expressions
of
rapture
that
are
current
on
those
occasions
but
on
the
contrary
became
so
loud
in
the
transports
of
that
his
voice
reached
the
ears
of
the
vigilant
stepmother
who
wakening
the
jeweller
from
his
first
nap
gave
him
to
understand
that
some
person
was
certainly
in
close
conversation
with
his
daughter
and
exhorted
him
to
rise
forthwith
and
vindicate
the
honour
of
his
family
the
german
who
was
naturally
of
a
phlegmatic
habit
and
never
went
to
bed
without
a
full
dose
of
the
creature
which
added
to
his
constitutional
drowsiness
gave
no
ear
to
his
wife

until
she
had
repeated
it
thrice
and
used
other
means
to
rouse
him

slumber
meanwhile

and
his
inamorata
overheard
her
information
and
our
hero
would
have
made
his
retreat
immediately
through
the
port
by
which
he
entered
had
not
his
intention
been
overruled
by
the
remonstrances
of
the
young
lady
who
observed
that
the
door
was
already
fast
bolted
and
could
not
possibly
be
opened
without
creating
a
noise
that
would
confirm
the
suspicion
of
her
parents
and
that
over
and
above
this
objection
he
would
in
sallying
from
that
door
run
the
risk
of
being
met
by
her
father
who
in
all
probability
would
present
himself
before
it
in
order
to
hinder
our
hero
escape
she
therefore
conveyed
him
softly
into
her
closet
where
she
assured
him
he
might
remain
with
great
tranquillity
in
full
confidence
that
she
would
take
such
measures
as
would
effectually
screen
him
from
detection
he
was
fain
to
depend
upon
her
assurance
and
accordingly
ensconced
himself
behind
her
but
he
could
not
help
sweating
with
apprehension
and
praying
fervently
to
god
for
his
deliverance
when
he
heard
the
jeweller
thundering
at
the
door
and
calling
to
his
daughter
for
admittance
wilhelmina
who
was
already
undressed
and
had
purposely
extinguished
the
light
pretended
to
be
suddenly
waked
from
her
sleep
and
starting
up
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
affright

terrible
accent

instant
there

a
man
in
your
bedchamber
and
by
the
lightning
and
thunder
i
will
wash
away
the
stain
he
has
cast
upon
my
honour
with
the
schellum
not
at
all
intimidated
by
this
boisterous
threat
she
admitted
him
without
hesitation
and
with
a
shrillness
of
voice
peculiar
to
herself
began
to
hold
forth
upon
her
own
innocence
and
his
unjust
suspicion
mingling
in
her
harangue
sundry
oblique
hints
against
her
importing
that
some
people
were
so
viciously
inclined
by
their
own
natures
that
she
did
not
wonder
at
their
doubting
the
virtue
of
other
people
but
that
these
people
despised
the
insinuations
of
such
people
who
ought
to
be
more
circumspect
in
their
own
conduct
lest
they
themselves
should
suffer
reprisals
from
those
people
whom
they
had
so
maliciously
slandered
having
uttered
these
flowers
of
rhetoric
which
were
calculated
for
the
hearing
of
her
who
stood
with
a
light
at
her
husband
back
the
young
lady
assumed
an
ironical
air
and
admonished
her
father
to
search
every
corner
of
her
apartment
she
even
affected
to
assist
his
inquiry

her
own
hands

out
a
parcel
of
small
drawers
in
which
her
trinkets
were
contained
desired
him
to
look
into
her
needlecase
and
thimble
and
seeing
his
examination
fruitless
earnestly
intreated
him
to
rummage
her
closet
also
saying
with
a
sneer
that
in
all
probability
the
dishonourer
would
be
found
in
that
the
manner
in
which
she
pretended
to
ridicule
his
apprehensions
made
an
impression
upon
the
jeweller
who
was
very
well
disposed
to
retreat
into
his
own
nest
when
his
wife
with
a
certain
slyness
in
her
countenance
besought
him
to
comply
with
his
daughter
request
and
look
into
that
same
closet
by
which
means
wilhelmina
virtue
would
obtain
a
complete
triumph
our
adventurer
who
overheard
the
conversation
was
immediately
seized
with
a
palsy
of
fear
he
trembled
at
every
joint
the
sweat
trickled
down
his
forehead
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
his
hair
to
stand
on
end
and
he
in
his
heart
bitterly
cursed
the
daughter
petulance
the
mother
malice
together
with
his
own
precipitation
by
which
he
was
involved
in
an
adventure
so
pregnant
with
danger
and
disgrace
indeed
the
reader
may
easily
conceive
his
disorder
when
he
heard
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
and
the
german
swearing
that
he
would
make
him
food
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
fathom
had
come
unprepared
with
weapons
of
defence
was
naturally
an
economist
of
his
person
and
saw
himself
on
the
brink
of
forfeiting
not
only
the
promised
harvest
of
his
double
intrigue
but
also
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
honour
upon
which
all
his
future
hopes
depended
his
agony
was
therefore
unspeakable
when
the
door
flew
open
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
of
recollection
that
he
perceived
the
candle
extinguished
by
the
motion
of
the
air
produced
from
the
german
sudden
irruption
this
accident
which
disconcerted
him
so
much
as
to
put
a
full
stop
to
his
charge
was
very
favourable
to
our
hero
who
summoning
all
his
presence
of
mind
crept
up
into
the
chimney
while
the
jeweller
stood
at
the
door
waiting
for
his
wife
return
with
another
light
so
that
when
the
closet
was
examined
there
was
nothing
found
to
justify
the
report
which
the
stepmother
had
made
and
the
father
after
having
made
a
slight
apology
to
wilhelmina
for
his
intrusion
retired
with
his
into
their
own
chamber
the
young
lady
who
little
thought
that
her
papa
would
have
taken
her
at
her
word
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
dismay
when
she
saw
him
enter
the
closet
and
had
her
lover
been
discovered
would
in
all
probability
have
been
the
loudest
in
his
reproach
and
perhaps
have
accused
him
of
an
intention
to
rob
the
house
but
she
was
altogether
astonished
when
she
found
he
had
made
shift
to
elude
the
inquiry
of
her
parents
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
his
escaping
by
the
window
which
was
in
the
third
storey
at
a
prodigious
distance
from
the
ground
and
how
he
should
conceal
himself
in
the
apartment
was
a
mystery
which
she
could
by
no
means
unfold
before
her
father
and
mother
retired
she
lighted
her
lamp
on
pretence
of
being
afraid
to
be
in
the
dark
after
the
perturbation
of
spirits
she
had
undergone
and
her
room
was
no
sooner
evacuated
of
such
troublesome
visitants
than
she
secured
the
doors
and
went
in
quest
of
her
lover
accordingly
every
corner
of
the
closet
underwent
a
new
search
and
she
called
upon
his
name
with
a
soft
voice
which
she
thought
no
other
person
would
overhear
but
ferdinand
did
not
think
proper
to
gratify
her
impatience
because
he
could
not
judge
of
the
predicament
in
which
he
stood
by
the
evidence
of
all
his
senses
and
would
not
relinquish
his
post
until
he
should
be
better
certified
that
the
coast
was
clear
meanwhile
his
dulcinea
having
performed
her
inquiry
to
no
purpose
imagined
there
was
something
preternatural
in
the
circumstance
of
his
vanishing
so
unaccountably
and
began
to
cross
herself
with
great
devotion
she
returned
to
her
chamber
fixed
the
lamp
in
the
fireplace
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
bed
gave
way
to
the
suggestions
of
her
superstition
which
were
reinforced
by
the
silence
that
prevailed
and
the
gloomy
glimmering
of
the
light
she
reflected
upon
the
trespass
she
had
already
committed
in
her
heart
and
in
the
conjectures
of
her
fear
believed
that
her
lover
was
no
other
than
the
devil
himself
who
had
assumed
the
appearance
of
fathom
in
order
to
tempt
and
seduce
her
virtue
while
her
imagination
teemed
with
those
horrible
ideas
our
adventurer
concluding
from
the
general
stillness
that
the
jeweller
and
his
wife
were
at
last
happily
asleep
ventured
to
come
forth
from
his
and
stood
before
his
mistress
all
begrimed
with
soot
wilhelmina
lifting
up
her
eyes
and
seeing
this
sable
apparition
which
she
mistook
for
satan
in
propria
persona
instantly
screamed
and
began
to
repeat
her
with
an
audible
voice
upon
which
ferdinand
foreseeing
that
her
parents
would
be
again
alarmed
would
not
stay
to
undeceive
her
and
explain
himself
but
unlocking
the
door
with
great
expedition
ran
downstairs
and
luckily
accomplished
his
escape
this
was
undoubtedly
the
wisest
measure
he
could
have
taken
for
he
had
not
performed
one
half
of
his
descent
toward
the
street
when
the
german
was
at
his
daughter
bedside
demanding
to
know
the
cause
of
her
exclamation
she
then
gave
him
an
account
of
what
she
had
seen
with
all
the
exaggerations
of
her
own
fancy
and
after
having
weighed
the
circumstances
of
her
story
he
interpreted
the
apparition
into
a
thief
who
had
found
means
to
open
the
door
that
communicated
with
the
stair
but
having
been
scared
by
wilhelmina
shriek
had
been
obliged
to
retreat
before
he
could
execute
his
purpose
our
hero
spirits
were
so
wofully
disturbed
by
this
adventure
that
for
a
whole
week
he
felt
no
inclination
to
visit
his
inamorata
and
was
not
without
apprehension
that
the
affair
had
terminated
in
an
explanation
very
little
to
his
advantage
he
was
however
delivered
from
this
disagreeable
suspense
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
jeweller
himself
who
kindly
chid
him
for
his
long
absence
and
entertained
him
in
the
street
with
an
account
of
the
alarm
which
his
family
had
sustained
by
a
thief
who
broke
into
wilhelmina
apartment
glad
to
find
his
apprehension
mistaken
he
renewed
his
correspondence
with
the
family
and
in
a
little
time
found
reason
to
console
himself
for
the
jeopardy
and
panic
he
had
undergone
chapter
fourteen
he
is
reduced
to
a
dreadful
dilemma
in
consequence
of
an
assignation
with
the
wife
nor
was
his
whole
care
and
attention
engrossed
by
the
execution
of
this
scheme
upon
the
daughter
while
he
managed
his
concerns
in
that
quarter
with
incredible
ardour
and
application
he
was
not
the
less
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
his
design
upon
the
which
he
forwarded
with
all
his
art
during
those
opportunities
he
enjoyed
in
the
absence
of
wilhelmina
who
was
frequently
called
away
by
the
domestic
duties
of
the
house
the
passions
of
the
jeweller
wife
were
in
such
a
state
of
exaltation
as
exempted
our
hero
from
the
repulses
and
fatigue
attending
a
long
siege
we
have
already
observed
how
cunningly
he
catered
for
the
gratification
of
her
ruling
appetite
and
have
exhibited
pregnant
proofs
of
his
ability
in
gaining
upon
the
human
heart
the
reader
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
conquest
over
the
affections
of
a
lady
whose
complexion
was
perfectly
amorous
and
whose
vanity
laid
her
open
to
all
the
attempts
of
adulation
in
a
word
matters
were
quickly
brought
to
such
a
mutual
understanding
that
one
evening
while
they
amused
themselves
at
lansquenet
fathom
conjured
her
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
next
day
at
the
house
of
any
third
person
of
her
own
sex
in
whose
discretion
she
could
confide
and
after
a
few
affected
scruples
on
her
side
which
he
well
knew
how
to
surmount
she
complied
with
his
request
and
the
circumstances
of
the
appointment
were
settled
accordingly
after
this
treaty
their
satisfaction
rose
to
such
a
warmth
and
the
conversation
became
so
reciprocally
endearing
that
our
gallant
expressed
his
impatience
of
waiting
so
long
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
and
with
the
most
eager
transport
begged
she
would
if
possible
curtail
the
term
of
his
expectation
that
his
brain
might
not
suffer
by
his
standing
so
many
tedious
hours
on
the
giddy
verge
of
rapture
the
dame
who
was
naturally
compassionate
sympathised
with
his
condition
and
unable
to
resist
his
pathetic
supplications
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
desire
could
not
be
granted
without
subjecting
them
both
to
some
hazard
but
that
she
was
disposed
to
run
any
risk
in
behalf
of
his
happiness
and
peace
after
this
affectionate
preamble
she
told
him
that
her
husband
was
then
engaged
in
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the
jewellers
from
whence
he
never
failed
to
return
quite
overwhelmed
with
wine
tobacco
and
the
phlegm
of
his
own
constitution
so
that
he
would
fall
fast
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
should
touch
the
pillow
and
she
be
at
liberty
to
entertain
the
lover
without
interruption
provided
he
could
find
means
to
deceive
the
jealous
vigilance
of
wilhelmina
and
conceal
himself
in
some
corner
of
the
house
unsuspected
and
unperceived
our
lover
remembering
his
adventure
with
the
daughter
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
this
expedient
and
began
to
repent
of
the
eagerness
with
which
he
had
preferred
his
solicitation
but
seeing
there
was
now
no
opportunity
of
retracting
with
honour
he
affected
to
enter
heartily
into
the
conversation
and
after
much
canvassing
it
was
determined
that
while
wilhelmina
was
employed
in
the
kitchen
the
mother
should
conduct
our
adventurer
to
the
outer
door
where
he
should
pay
the
compliment
of
parting
so
as
to
be
overheard
by
the
young
lady
but
in
the
meantime
glide
softly
into
the
jeweller
bedchamber
which
was
a
place
they
imagined
least
liable
to
the
effects
of
a
prying
disposition
and
conceal
himself
in
a
large
press
or
wardrobe
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
the
scene
was
immediately
acted
with
great
success
and
our
hero
cooped
up
in
his
cage
where
he
waited
so
long
that
his
desires
began
to
subside
and
his
imagination
to
aggravate
the
danger
of
his
situation
suppose
said
he
to
himself
this
brutal
german
instead
of
being
stupefied
with
wine
should
come
home
inflamed
with
brandy
to
the
use
of
which
he
is
sometimes
addicted
far
from
feeling
any
inclination
to
sleep
he
will
labour
under
the
most
fretful
anxiety
of
watching
every
irascible
particle
in
his
disposition
will
be
exasperated
he
will
be
offended
with
every
object
that
may
present
itself
to
his
view
and
if
there
is
the
least
ingredient
of
jealousy
in
his
temper
it
will
manifest
itself
in
riot
and
rage
what
if
his
frenzy
should
prompt
him
to
search
his
wife
chamber
for
gallants
this
would
certainly
be
the
first
place
to
which
he
would
direct
his
inquiry
or
granting
this
supposition
chimerical
i
may
be
seized
with
an
irresistible
inclination
to
cough
before
he
is
oppressed
with
sleep
he
may
be
waked
by
the
noise
i
shall
make
in
disengaging
myself
from
this
embarrassed
situation
and
finally
i
may
find
it
impracticable
to
retire
unseen
or
unheard
after
everything
else
shall
have
succeeded
to
my
these
suggestions
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
quiet
of
our
adventurer
who
having
waited
three
whole
hours
in
the
most
uncomfortable
suspense
heard
the
jeweller
brought
into
the
room
in
that
very
condition
which
his
fears
had
prognosticated
he
had
it
seems
quarrelled
over
his
cups
with
another
tradesman
and
received
a
salutation
on
the
forehead
with
a
candlestick
which
not
only
left
an
ignominious
and
painful
mark
upon
his
countenance
but
even
disordered
his
brain
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
delirium
so
that
instead
of
allowing
himself
quietly
to
be
undressed
and
put
to
bed
by
his
wife
he
answered
all
her
gentle
admonitions
and
caresses
with
the
most
opprobrious
invectives
and
obstreperous
behaviour
and
though
he
did
not
tax
her
with
infidelity
to
his
bed
he
virulently
accused
her
of
extravagance
and
want
of
economy
observed
her
expensive
way
of
living
would
bring
him
to
a
morsel
of
bread
and
unfortunately
recollecting
the
attempt
of
the
supposed
thief
started
up
from
his
chair
swearing
by
g
mother
that
he
would
forthwith
arm
himself
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
search
every
apartment
in
the
house
that
press
said
he
with
great
vociferation
may
for
aught
i
know
be
the
receptacle
of
some
so
saying
he
approached
the
ark
in
which
fathom
was
embarked
and
exclaiming
come
forth
satan
applied
his
foot
to
the
door
of
it
with
such
violence
as
threw
him
from
the
centre
of
gravity
and
laid
him
sprawling
on
his
back
this
address
made
such
an
impression
upon
our
adventurer
that
he
had
obeyed
the
summons
and
burst
from
his
concealment
in
a
desperate
effort
to
escape
without
being
recognised
by
the
intoxicated
german
and
indeed
had
the
application
been
repeated
he
in
all
likelihood
would
have
tried
the
experiment
for
by
this
time
his
terrors
had
waxed
too
strong
to
be
much
longer
suppressed
from
this
hazardous
enterprise
he
was
however
exempted
by
a
lucky
accident
that
happened
to
his
disturber
whose
head
chancing
to
pitch
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
in
his
fall
he
was
immediately
lulled
into
a
trance
during
which
the
considerate
lady
guessing
the
disorder
of
her
gallant
and
dreading
further
interruption
very
prudently
released
him
from
his
confinement
after
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
in
the
dark
conveyed
him
to
the
door
where
he
was
comforted
with
the
promise
that
she
would
punctually
remember
the
rendezvous
of
next
day
she
then
invoked
the
assistance
of
the
servants
who
being
waked
for
the
purpose
lifted
up
their
master
and
tumbled
him
into
bed
while
ferdinand
hied
him
home
in
an
universal
sweat
blessing
himself
from
any
future
achievement
of
that
sort
in
a
house
where
he
had
been
twice
in
such
imminent
danger
of
life
and
reputation
nevertheless
he
did
not
fail
to
honour
the
assignation
and
avail
himself
of
the
disposition
his
mistress
manifested
to
make
him
all
the
recompense
in
her
power
for
the
disappointment
and
chagrin
which
he
had
undergone
chapter
fifteen
but
at
length
succeeds
in
his
attempt
upon
both
having
thus
gained
a
complete
victory
over
the
affections
of
these
two
ladies
he
began
to
convert
his
good
fortune
to
the
purposes
of
that
principle
from
which
his
view
was
never
no
not
for
a
moment
detached
in
other
words
he
used
them
as
ministers
and
purveyors
to
his
avarice
and
fraud
as
for
the
she
was
of
herself
so
liberal
as
to
anticipate
the
wishes
of
any
moderate
adventurer
and
presented
him
with
sundry
valuable
jewels
as
memorials
of
her
esteem
nor
was
the
daughter
backward
in
such
expressions
of
regard
she
already
considered
his
interest
as
her
own
and
took
frequent
opportunities
of
secreting
for
his
benefit
certain
stray
trinkets
that
she
happened
to
pick
up
in
her
excursions
within
doors
all
these
gratifications
he
received
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
constraint
and
reluctance
and
in
the
midst
of
his
rapacious
extortion
acted
so
cunningly
as
to
impose
himself
upon
both
for
a
miracle
of
disinterested
integrity
yet
not
contented
with
what
he
thus
could
earn
and
despairing
of
being
able
to
steer
the
bark
of
his
fortune
for
any
length
of
time
between
two
such
dangerous
quicksands
he
resolved
to
profit
by
the
occasion
while
it
lasted
and
strike
some
considerable
stroke
at
once
a
plan
was
formed
in
consequence
of
this
determination
and
at
an
appointment
with
the
mother
in
the
house
of
their
female
friend
our
adventurer
appeared
with
an
air
of
dejection
which
he
veiled
with
a
thin
cover
of
forced
pleasantry
that
his
mistress
might
suppose
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
mortal
chagrin
that
preyed
upon
his
heart
the
stratagem
succeeded
to
his
wish
she
observed
his
countenance
between
whiles
overcast
took
notice
of
the
involuntary
sighs
he
heaved
and
with
the
most
tender
expressions
of
sympathy
conjured
him
to
make
her
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
affliction
instead
of
gratifying
her
request
immediately
he
evaded
her
questions
with
a
respectful
reserve
implying
that
his
love
would
not
suffer
him
to
make
her
a
partner
in
his
sorrow
and
this
delicacy
on
his
part
whetted
her
impatience
and
concern
to
such
a
degree
that
rather
than
keep
her
in
such
an
agony
of
doubt
and
apprehension
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
tell
her
that
he
had
been
the
preceding
night
engaged
with
a
company
of
his
where
he
had
made
too
free
with
the
champagne
so
that
his
caution
forsook
him
and
he
had
been
decoyed
into
play
by
a
tyrolese
gamester
who
stripped
him
of
all
his
ready
money
and
obtained
from
him
an
obligation
for
two
hundred
florins
which
he
could
not
possibly
pay
without
having
recourse
to
his
relation
the
count
de
melvil
who
would
have
just
cause
to
be
incensed
at
his
extravagance
this
information
he
concluded
by
declaring
that
cost
what
it
would
he
was
resolved
to
make
a
candid
confession
of
the
truth
and
throw
himself
entirely
upon
the
generosity
of
his
patron
who
could
inflict
no
other
punishment
than
that
of
discarding
him
from
his
favour
and
protection
a
misfortune
which
how
grievous
soever
it
might
be
he
should
be
able
to
sustain
with
fortitude
could
he
fall
upon
some
method
of
satisfying
the
tyrolese
who
was
very
importunate
and
savage
in
his
demand
his
kind
mistress
no
sooner
found
out
the
source
of
his
inquietude
than
she
promised
to
dry
it
up
assuring
him
that
next
day
at
the
same
hour
she
would
enable
him
to
discharge
the
debt
so
that
he
might
set
his
heart
at
ease
and
recollect
that
gaiety
which
was
the
soul
of
her
enjoyment
he
expressed
the
utmost
astonishment
at
this
generous
proffer
which
however
he
declined
with
an
affected
earnestness
of
refusal
protesting
that
he
should
be
extremely
mortified
if
he
thought
she
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
those
mercenary
gallants
who
could
make
such
a
sordid
use
of
a
lady
affection
no
madam
cried
our
politician
in
a
pathetic
strain
whatever
happens
i
shall
never
part
with
that
internal
consolation
that
conscious
honour
never
fails
to
yield
in
the
deepest
scenes
of
solitary
distress
the
attachment
i
have
the
honour
to
profess
for
your
amiable
person
is
not
founded
on
such
inglorious
motives
but
is
the
genuine
result
of
that
generous
passion
which
none
but
the
feel
and
the
only
circumstance
of
this
misfortune
that
i
dread
to
encounter
is
the
necessity
of
withdrawing
myself
for
ever
from
the
presence
of
her
whose
genial
smiles
could
animate
my
soul
against
all
the
persecution
of
adverse
this
declamation
accompanied
with
a
profound
sigh
served
only
to
inflame
her
desire
of
extricating
him
from
the
difficulty
in
which
he
was
involved
she
exhausted
all
her
eloquence
in
attempting
to
persuade
him
that
his
refusal
was
an
outrage
against
her
affection
he
pretended
to
refute
her
arguments
and
remained
unshaken
by
all
the
power
of
her
solicitations
until
she
had
recourse
to
the
most
passionate
remonstrances
of
love
and
fell
at
his
feet
in
the
posture
of
a
forlorn
shepherdess
what
he
refused
to
her
reason
he
granted
to
her
tears
because
his
heart
was
melted
by
her
affliction
and
next
day
condescended
to
accept
of
her
money
out
of
pure
regard
to
her
happiness
and
peace
encouraged
by
the
success
of
this
achievement
he
resolved
to
practise
the
same
experiment
upon
wilhelmina
in
hope
of
extracting
an
equal
share
of
profit
from
her
simplicity
and
attachment
and
at
their
very
next
nocturnal
rendezvous
in
her
chamber
reacted
the
farce
already
rehearsed
with
a
small
variation
which
he
thought
necessary
to
stimulate
the
young
lady
in
his
behalf
he
rightly
concluded
that
she
was
by
no
means
mistress
of
such
a
considerable
sum
as
he
had
already
extorted
from
her
mother
and
therefore
thought
proper
to
represent
himself
in
the
most
urgent
predicament
that
her
apprehension
on
his
account
might
be
so
alarmed
as
to
engage
her
in
some
enterprise
for
his
advantage
which
otherwise
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
undertaking
with
this
view
after
having
described
his
own
calamitous
situation
in
consequence
of
her
pressing
entreaties
which
he
affected
to
evade
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
there
was
no
person
upon
earth
to
whom
he
would
have
recourse
in
this
emergency
for
which
reason
he
was
determined
to
rid
himself
of
all
his
cares
at
once
upon
the
friendly
point
of
his
own
faithful
sword
such
a
dreadful
resolution
could
not
fail
to
operate
upon
the
tender
passions
of
his
dulcinea
she
was
instantly
seized
with
an
agony
of
fear
and
distraction
her
grief
manifested
itself
in
a
flood
of
tears
while
she
hung
round
his
neck
conjuring
him
in
the
most
melting
terms
by
their
mutual
love
in
which
they
had
been
so
happy
to
lay
aside
that
fatal
determination
which
would
infallibly
involve
her
in
the
same
fate
for
she
took
heaven
to
witness
that
she
would
not
one
moment
survive
the
knowledge
of
his
death
he
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
reciprocal
regard
he
extolled
her
love
and
tenderness
with
a
most
extravagant
eulogium
and
seemed
wrung
with
mortal
anguish
at
the
prospect
of
parting
for
ever
from
his
lovely
wilhelmina
but
his
honour
was
a
stern
and
rigid
creditor
that
could
not
be
appeased
except
with
his
blood
and
all
the
boon
she
could
obtain
by
dint
of
the
most
woful
supplication
was
a
promise
to
defer
the
execution
of
his
baleful
purpose
for
the
space
of
hours
during
which
she
hoped
heaven
would
compassionate
her
sufferings
and
inspire
her
with
some
contrivance
for
their
mutual
relief
thus
he
yielded
to
her
fervent
request
rather
with
a
view
to
calm
the
present
transports
of
her
sorrow
than
with
any
expectation
of
seeing
himself
redeemed
from
his
fate
by
her
interposition
such
at
least
were
his
professions
when
he
took
his
leave
assuring
her
that
he
would
not
quit
his
being
before
he
should
have
devoted
a
few
hours
to
another
interview
with
the
dear
object
of
his
love
having
thus
kindled
the
train
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
mine
of
his
craft
would
take
effect
and
repaired
to
his
own
lodging
in
full
persuasion
of
seeing
his
aim
accomplished
before
the
time
fixed
for
their
last
assignation
his
prognostic
was
next
morning
verified
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
who
brought
to
him
a
small
parcel
to
which
was
cemented
with
sealing
wax
the
following
epistle
jewel
of
my
soul
scarce
had
you
last
night
quitted
my
disconsolate
arms
when
i
happily
recollected
that
there
was
in
my
possession
a
gold
chain
of
value
more
than
sufficient
to
answer
the
exigence
of
your
present
occasions
it
was
pledged
to
my
grandfather
for
two
hundred
crowns
by
a
knight
of
malta
who
soon
after
perished
in
a
sea
engagement
with
the
enemies
of
our
faith
so
that
it
became
the
property
of
our
house
and
was
bequeathed
to
me
by
the
old
gentleman
as
a
memorial
of
his
particular
affection
upon
whom
can
i
more
properly
bestow
it
than
him
who
is
already
master
of
my
heart
receive
it
therefore
from
the
bearer
of
this
billet
and
convert
it
without
scruple
to
that
use
which
shall
be
most
conducive
to
your
ease
and
satisfaction
nor
seek
from
a
true
romantic
notion
of
honour
which
i
know
you
entertain
to
excuse
yourself
from
accepting
this
testimony
of
my
affection
for
i
have
already
sworn
before
an
image
of
our
blessed
lady
that
i
will
no
longer
own
you
as
the
sovereign
of
my
heart
nor
even
indulge
you
with
another
interview
if
you
reject
this
mark
of
tenderness
and
concern
from
your
ever
faithful
the
heart
of
our
adventurer
began
to
bound
with
joy
when
he
surveyed
the
contents
of
this
letter
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
transport
at
sight
of
the
chain
which
he
immediately
perceived
to
be
worth
twice
the
sum
she
had
mentioned
nevertheless
he
would
not
avail
himself
without
further
question
of
her
generosity
but
that
same
night
repairing
to
her
apartment
at
the
usual
hour
of
meeting
he
prostrated
himself
before
her
and
counterfeiting
extreme
agitation
of
spirit
begged
in
the
most
urgent
terms
not
even
unaccompanied
with
tears
that
she
would
take
back
the
present
which
he
tendered
for
her
acceptance
and
spare
him
the
most
insufferable
mortification
of
thinking
himself
exposed
to
the
imputation
of
being
mercenary
in
his
love
such
he
said
was
the
delicacy
of
his
passion
that
he
could
not
possibly
exist
under
the
apprehension
of
incurring
a
censure
so
unworthy
of
his
sentiments
and
he
would
a
thousand
times
sooner
undergo
the
persecution
of
his
rancorous
creditor
than
bear
the
thought
of
being
in
the
smallest
consideration
lessened
in
her
esteem
nay
so
far
did
he
carry
his
pretensions
to
punctilio
as
to
protest
that
should
she
refuse
to
quiet
the
scruples
of
his
honour
on
this
score
her
unyielding
beneficence
would
serve
only
to
hasten
the
execution
of
his
determined
purpose
to
withdraw
himself
at
once
from
a
life
of
vanity
and
misfortune
the
more
pathetically
he
pleaded
for
her
compliance
the
more
strenuously
did
she
resist
his
remonstrances
she
advanced
all
the
arguments
her
reason
love
and
terror
could
suggest
reminded
him
of
her
oath
from
which
he
could
not
suppose
she
would
recede
whatever
the
consequence
might
be
and
in
conclusion
vowed
to
heaven
with
great
solemnity
and
devotion
that
she
would
not
survive
the
news
of
his
death
thus
the
alternative
she
offered
was
either
to
retain
the
chain
and
be
happy
in
her
affection
or
forfeit
all
title
to
her
love
and
die
in
the
conviction
of
having
brought
his
innocent
mistress
to
an
untimely
grave
his
fortitude
was
not
proof
against
this
last
consideration
my
savage
honour
said
he
would
enable
me
to
endure
the
pangs
of
eternal
separation
in
the
confidence
of
being
endowed
with
the
power
of
ending
these
tortures
by
the
energy
of
my
own
hand
but
the
prospect
of
wilhelmina
death
and
that
too
occasioned
by
my
inflexibility
disarms
my
soul
of
all
her
resolution
swallows
up
the
dictates
of
my
jealous
pride
and
fills
my
bosom
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
as
overwhelms
the
whole
economy
of
my
purpose
yes
enchanting
creature
i
sacrifice
my
glory
to
that
irresistible
reflection
and
rather
than
know
myself
the
cruel
instrument
of
robbing
the
world
of
such
perfection
consent
to
retain
the
fatal
testimony
of
your
so
saying
he
pocketed
the
chain
with
an
air
of
ineffable
mortification
and
was
rewarded
for
his
compliance
with
the
most
endearing
caresses
of
his
dulcinea
who
amidst
the
tumults
of
her
joy
ejaculated
a
thousand
acknowledgments
to
heaven
for
having
blessed
her
with
the
affection
of
such
a
man
whose
honour
was
unrivalled
by
anything
but
his
love
chapter
sixteen
his
success
begets
a
blind
security
by
which
he
is
once
again
entrapped
in
his
dulcinea
apartment
in
this
manner
did
the
crafty
fathom
turn
to
account
those
ingratiating
qualifications
he
inherited
from
nature
and
maintain
with
incredible
assiduity
and
circumspection
an
amorous
correspondence
with
two
domestic
rivals
who
watched
the
conduct
of
each
other
with
the
most
indefatigable
virulence
of
envious
suspicion
until
an
accident
happened
which
had
overturned
the
bark
of
his
policy
and
induced
him
to
alter
the
course
that
he
might
not
be
shipwrecked
on
the
rocks
that
began
to
multiply
in
the
prosecution
of
his
present
voyage
the
jeweller
who
as
a
german
wanted
neither
pride
nor
ostentation
never
failed
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
by
an
annual
feast
granted
to
his
neighbours
and
friends
and
on
these
occasions
was
accustomed
to
wear
that
chain
which
though
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
he
considered
as
an
ornament
appertaining
to
the
family
whereof
he
himself
was
head
accordingly
when
the
time
of
this
festival
revolved
he
as
usual
ordered
wilhelmina
to
surrender
it
for
the
day
this
injunction
the
reader
will
perceive
our
young
lady
was
in
no
condition
to
obey
she
had
however
foreseen
the
demand
and
contrived
a
scheme
of
behaviour
for
the
occasion
which
she
forthwith
put
in
execution
with
an
air
of
uncommon
cheerfulness
purposely
assumed
she
retired
to
her
closet
on
pretence
of
complying
with
his
desire
and
having
employed
a
few
minutes
in
rummaging
her
drawers
and
disordering
her
moveables
uttered
a
loud
shriek
that
brought
her
father
instantly
into
the
apartment
where
he
found
his
daughter
tossing
about
her
clothes
and
trinkets
with
violent
demonstrations
of
disorder
and
affright
and
heard
her
in
a
lamentable
strain
declare
that
she
was
robbed
of
her
chain
and
for
ever
undone
this
was
so
far
from
being
an
agreeable
intimation
to
the
jeweller
that
he
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
and
vexation
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
long
pause
that
he
pronounced
the
word
sacrament
with
an
emphasis
denoting
the
most
mortifying
surprise
soon
as
that
exclamation
escaped
from
his
lips
he
flew
to
the
escritoire
as
if
instinctively
and
joining
wilhelmina
in
her
occupation
tumbled
its
whole
contents
upon
the
floor
in
a
trice
while
he
was
thus
employed
in
the
most
expressive
silence
the
wife
of
his
bosom
chanced
to
pass
that
way
and
seeing
them
both
occupied
with
such
violence
and
trepidation
believed
at
first
that
they
were
certainly
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
frenzy
but
when
she
interposed
by
asking
with
great
earnestness
the
cause
of
such
transports
and
distracted
behaviour
and
heard
her
husband
reply
with
an
accent
of
despair
the
chain
the
chain
of
my
forefathers
is
no
more
she
immediately
justified
his
emotion
by
undergoing
the
same
alarm
and
without
further
hesitation
engaged
herself
in
the
search
beginning
with
a
song
which
might
be
compared
to
the
hymn
of
battle
among
the
greeks
or
rather
more
aptly
to
that
which
the
spartan
females
sung
round
the
altar
of
diana
surnamed
orthian
for
it
was
attended
with
strange
gesticulations
and
in
the
course
of
utterance
became
so
loud
and
shrill
that
the
guests
who
were
by
this
time
partly
assembled
being
confounded
at
the
clamour
rushed
towards
the
place
from
whence
it
seemed
to
proceed
and
found
their
landlord
with
his
wife
and
daughter
in
the
attitudes
of
distraction
and
despair
when
they
understood
the
nature
of
the
case
they
condoled
the
family
on
their
misfortune
and
would
have
retired
on
the
supposition
that
it
would
defeat
the
mirthful
intent
of
their
meeting
but
the
jeweller
mustering
up
his
whole
temper
and
hospitality
entreated
them
to
excuse
his
disorder
and
favour
him
with
their
company
which
he
observed
was
now
more
than
ever
wanted
to
dispel
the
melancholy
ideas
inspired
by
his
loss
notwithstanding
this
apology
and
the
efforts
he
made
in
the
sequel
to
entertain
his
friends
with
jollity
and
his
heart
was
so
linked
to
the
chain
that
he
could
not
detach
himself
from
the
thoughts
of
it
which
invaded
him
at
short
intervals
in
such
qualms
as
effectually
spoiled
his
appetite
and
hindered
his
digestion
he
revolved
within
himself
the
circumstances
of
his
disaster
and
in
canvassing
all
the
probable
means
by
which
the
chain
would
be
stolen
concluded
that
the
deed
must
have
been
done
by
some
person
in
the
family
who
in
consequence
of
having
access
to
his
daughter
chamber
had
either
found
the
drawer
left
open
by
her
carelessness
and
neglect
or
found
means
to
obtain
a
false
key
by
some
waxen
impression
for
the
locks
of
the
escritoire
were
safe
and
uninjured
his
suspicion
being
thus
confined
within
his
own
house
sometimes
pitched
upon
his
workmen
and
sometimes
upon
his
wife
who
he
thought
was
the
more
likely
to
practise
such
finesse
as
she
considered
wilhelmina
in
the
light
of
a
whose
interest
interfered
with
her
own
and
who
had
often
harangued
to
him
in
private
on
the
folly
of
leaving
this
very
chain
in
the
young
lady
possession
the
more
he
considered
this
subject
he
thought
he
saw
the
more
reason
to
attribute
the
damage
he
had
sustained
to
the
machinations
of
his
spouse
who
he
did
not
doubt
was
disposed
to
feather
her
own
nest
at
the
expense
of
him
and
his
heirs
and
who
with
the
same
honest
intention
had
already
secreted
for
her
private
use
those
inconsiderable
jewels
which
of
late
had
at
different
times
been
missing
aroused
by
these
sentiments
he
resolved
to
retaliate
her
own
schemes
by
contriving
means
to
visit
her
cabinet
in
secret
and
if
possible
to
rob
the
robber
of
the
spoils
she
had
gathered
to
his
prejudice
without
coming
to
any
explanation
which
might
end
in
domestic
turmoils
and
eternal
disquiet
while
the
husband
exercised
his
reflection
in
this
manner
his
innocent
mate
did
not
allow
the
powers
of
her
imagination
to
rest
in
idleness
and
sloth
her
observations
touching
the
loss
of
the
chain
were
such
as
a
suspicious
woman
biassed
by
hatred
and
envy
would
naturally
make
to
her
it
seemed
highly
improbable
that
a
thing
of
such
value
so
carefully
deposited
should
vanish
without
the
connivance
of
its
keeper
and
without
much
expense
of
conjecture
divined
the
true
manner
in
which
it
was
conveyed
the
sole
difficulty
that
occurred
in
the
researches
of
her
sagacity
was
to
know
the
gallant
who
had
been
favoured
with
such
a
pledge
of
wilhelmina
affection
for
as
the
reader
will
easily
imagine
she
never
dreamed
of
viewing
ferdinand
in
that
odious
perspective
in
order
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
discover
this
happy
favourite
and
be
revenged
on
her
petulant
rival
she
prevailed
upon
the
jeweller
to
employ
a
scout
who
should
watch
all
night
upon
the
stair
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
in
the
family
alleging
that
in
all
likelihood
the
housemaid
gave
private
admittance
to
some
lover
who
was
the
author
of
all
the
losses
they
had
lately
suffered
and
that
they
might
possibly
detect
him
in
his
nocturnal
adventures
and
observing
that
it
would
be
imprudent
to
intimate
their
design
to
wilhelmina
lest
through
the
heedlessness
and
indiscretion
of
youth
she
might
chance
to
divulge
the
secret
so
as
to
frustrate
their
aim
a
swiss
in
whose
honesty
the
german
could
confide
being
hired
for
this
purpose
was
posted
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
staircase
within
a
few
paces
of
the
door
which
he
was
directed
to
watch
and
actually
stood
sentinel
three
nights
without
perceiving
the
least
object
of
suspicion
but
on
the
fourth
the
evil
stars
of
our
adventurer
conducted
him
to
the
spot
on
his
voyage
to
the
apartment
of
his
dulcinea
with
whom
he
had
preconcerted
the
assignation
having
made
the
signal
which
consisted
of
two
gentle
taps
on
her
door
he
was
immediately
admitted
and
the
swiss
no
sooner
saw
him
fairly
housed
than
he
crept
softly
to
the
other
door
that
was
left
open
for
the
purpose
and
gave
immediate
intimation
of
what
he
had
perceived
this
intelligence
however
he
could
not
convey
so
secretly
but
the
lovers
who
were
always
vigilant
upon
these
occasions
overheard
a
sort
of
commotion
in
the
jeweller
chamber
the
cause
of
which
their
apprehension
was
ingenious
enough
to
comprehend
we
have
formerly
observed
that
our
adventurer
could
not
make
his
retreat
by
the
door
without
running
a
very
great
risk
of
being
detected
and
the
expedient
of
the
chimney
he
had
no
inclination
to
repeat
so
that
he
found
himself
in
a
very
uncomfortable
dilemma
and
was
utterly
abandoned
by
all
his
invention
and
address
when
his
mistress
in
a
whisper
desired
him
to
begin
a
dialogue
aloud
in
an
apology
importing
that
he
had
mistaken
the
door
and
that
his
intention
was
to
visit
her
father
touching
a
ring
belonging
to
the
young
count
melvil
which
she
knew
fathom
had
put
into
his
hands
in
order
to
be
altered
ferdinand
seizing
the
hint
availed
himself
of
it
without
delay
and
unbolting
the
door
pronounced
in
an
audible
voice
upon
my
honour
mademoiselle
you
wrong
my
intention
if
you
imagine
i
came
hither
with
any
disrespectful
or
dishonourable
motive
i
have
business
with
your
father
which
can
not
be
delayed
till
without
manifest
prejudice
to
my
friend
and
myself
therefore
i
took
the
liberty
of
visiting
him
at
these
untimely
hours
and
it
has
been
my
misfortune
to
mistake
the
door
in
the
dark
i
beg
pardon
for
my
involuntary
intrusion
and
again
assure
you
that
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
than
any
design
to
violate
that
respect
which
i
have
always
entertained
for
you
and
your
father
to
this
remonstrance
which
was
distinctly
heard
by
the
german
and
his
wife
who
by
this
time
stood
listening
at
the
door
the
young
lady
replied
in
a
shrill
accent
of
displeasure
sir
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
all
your
actions
are
conducted
by
honour
but
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
that
your
mistake
is
a
little
extraordinary
and
your
visit
even
to
my
father
at
this
time
of
the
night
altogether
unseasonable
if
not
mysterious
as
for
the
interruption
i
have
suffered
in
my
repose
i
impute
it
to
my
own
forgetfulness
in
leaving
my
door
unlocked
and
blame
myself
so
severely
for
the
omission
that
i
shall
put
it
out
of
my
own
power
to
be
guilty
of
the
like
for
the
future
by
ordering
the
passage
to
be
nailed
up
meanwhile
if
you
would
persuade
me
of
your
you
will
instantly
withdraw
lest
my
reputation
should
suffer
by
your
continuance
in
my
madam
answered
our
hero
i
will
not
give
you
an
opportunity
to
repeat
the
command
which
i
shall
forthwith
obey
after
having
entreated
you
once
more
to
forgive
the
disturbance
i
have
so
saying
he
gently
opened
the
door
and
at
sight
of
the
german
and
his
wife
who
he
well
knew
waited
for
his
exit
started
back
and
gave
tokens
of
confusion
which
was
partly
real
and
partly
affected
the
jeweller
fully
satisfied
with
fathom
declaration
to
his
daughter
received
him
with
a
complaisant
look
and
in
order
to
alleviate
his
concern
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
already
knew
the
reason
of
his
being
in
that
apartment
and
desired
to
be
informed
of
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
to
see
him
at
such
a
juncture
my
dear
friend
said
our
adventurer
pretending
to
recollect
himself
with
difficulty
i
am
utterly
ashamed
and
confounded
to
be
discovered
in
this
situation
but
as
you
have
overheard
what
passed
between
mademoiselle
and
me
i
know
you
will
do
justice
to
my
intention
and
forgive
my
mistake
after
begging
pardon
for
having
intruded
upon
your
family
at
these
hours
i
must
now
tell
you
that
my
cousin
count
melvil
was
some
time
ago
so
much
misrepresented
to
his
mother
by
certain
malicious
informers
who
delight
in
sowing
discord
in
private
families
that
she
actually
believed
her
son
an
extravagant
spendthrift
who
had
not
only
consumed
his
remittances
in
the
most
riotous
scenes
of
disorder
but
also
indulged
a
pernicious
appetite
for
gaming
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
lost
all
his
clothes
and
jewels
at
play
in
consequence
of
such
false
information
she
expostulated
with
him
in
a
severe
letter
and
desired
he
would
transmit
to
her
that
ring
which
is
in
your
custody
it
being
a
family
stone
for
which
she
expressed
an
inestimable
value
the
young
gentleman
in
his
answer
to
her
reproof
endeavoured
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
aspersions
which
had
been
cast
upon
his
character
and
with
regard
to
the
ring
told
her
it
was
at
present
in
the
hands
of
a
jeweller
in
order
to
be
new
set
according
to
her
own
directions
and
that
whenever
it
should
be
altered
he
would
send
it
home
to
her
by
some
safe
conveyance
this
account
the
good
lady
took
for
an
evasion
and
upon
that
supposition
has
again
written
to
him
in
such
a
provoking
style
that
although
the
letter
arrived
but
half
an
hour
ago
he
is
determined
to
despatch
a
courier
before
morning
with
the
mischievous
ring
for
which
in
compliance
with
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
i
have
taken
the
freedom
to
disturb
you
at
this
unseasonable
the
german
paid
implicit
faith
to
every
circumstance
of
his
story
which
indeed
could
not
well
be
supposed
to
be
invented
extempore
the
ring
was
immediately
restored
and
our
adventurer
took
his
leave
congratulating
himself
upon
his
signal
deliverance
from
the
snare
in
which
he
had
fallen
chapter
seventeen
the
suspicions
being
awakened
she
lays
a
snare
for
our
adventurer
from
which
he
is
delivered
by
the
interposition
of
his
good
genius
though
the
husband
swallowed
the
bait
without
further
inquiry
the
penetration
of
the
wife
was
not
so
easily
deceived
that
same
dialogue
in
wilhelmina
apartment
far
from
allaying
rather
inflamed
her
suspicion
because
in
the
like
emergency
she
herself
had
once
profited
by
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
contrivance
without
communicating
her
doubts
to
the
father
she
resolved
to
double
her
attention
to
the
daughter
future
conduct
and
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
the
behaviour
of
our
gallant
that
he
should
find
it
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
elude
her
observation
for
this
purpose
she
took
into
her
pay
an
old
maiden
of
the
right
sour
disposition
who
lived
in
a
house
opposite
to
her
own
and
directed
her
to
follow
the
young
lady
in
all
her
outgoings
whenever
she
should
receive
from
the
window
a
certain
signal
which
the
agreed
to
make
for
the
occasion
it
was
not
long
before
this
scheme
succeeded
to
her
wish
the
door
of
communication
betwixt
wilhelmina
apartment
and
the
staircase
being
nailed
up
by
the
jeweller
express
order
our
adventurer
was
altogether
deprived
of
those
opportunities
he
had
hitherto
enjoyed
and
was
not
at
all
mortified
to
find
himself
so
restricted
in
a
correspondence
which
began
to
be
tiresome
and
disagreeable
but
the
case
was
far
otherwise
with
his
dulcinea
whose
passion
the
more
it
was
thwarted
raged
with
greater
violence
like
a
fire
that
from
the
attempts
that
are
made
to
extinguish
it
gathers
greater
force
and
flames
with
double
fury
upon
the
second
day
of
her
misfortune
she
had
written
a
very
tender
billet
lamenting
her
unhappiness
in
being
deprived
of
those
meetings
which
constituted
the
chief
joy
of
her
life
and
entreating
him
to
contrive
some
means
of
renewing
the
delicious
commerce
in
an
unsuspected
place
this
intimation
she
proposed
to
convey
privately
into
the
hand
of
her
lover
during
his
next
visit
to
the
family
but
both
were
so
narrowly
eyed
by
the
mother
that
she
found
the
execution
of
her
design
impracticable
and
next
forenoon
on
pretence
of
going
to
church
repaired
to
the
house
of
a
companion
who
being
also
her
confidant
undertook
to
deliver
the
billet
with
her
own
hand
the
employed
by
her
mother
in
obedience
to
the
sign
which
was
displayed
from
the
window
immediately
put
on
her
veil
and
followed
wilhelmina
at
a
distance
until
she
saw
her
fairly
housed
she
would
not
even
then
return
from
her
excursion
but
hovered
about
in
sight
of
the
door
with
a
view
of
making
further
observations
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
the
young
lady
disappeared
the
scout
perceived
her
coming
out
accompanied
by
her
comrade
from
whom
she
instantly
parted
and
bent
her
way
towards
the
church
in
good
earnest
while
the
other
steered
her
course
in
another
direction
the
duenna
after
a
moment
suspense
and
consideration
divined
the
true
cause
of
this
short
visit
and
resolved
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
confidant
whom
she
traced
to
the
academy
in
which
our
hero
lodged
and
from
which
she
saw
her
return
after
the
supposed
message
was
delivered
fraught
with
this
intelligence
the
rancorous
understrapper
hied
her
home
to
the
jeweller
wife
and
made
a
faithful
recital
of
what
she
had
seen
communicating
at
the
same
time
her
own
conjectures
on
that
subject
her
employer
was
equally
astonished
and
incensed
at
this
information
she
was
seized
with
all
that
frenzy
which
takes
possession
of
a
slighted
woman
when
she
finds
herself
supplanted
by
a
detested
rival
and
in
the
first
transports
of
her
indignation
devoted
them
as
sacrifices
to
her
vengeance
nor
was
her
surprise
so
much
the
effect
of
his
dissimulation
as
of
his
want
of
taste
and
discernment
she
inveighed
against
him
not
as
the
most
treacherous
lover
but
as
the
most
abject
wretch
in
courting
the
smiles
of
such
an
awkward
dowdy
while
he
enjoyed
the
favours
of
a
woman
who
had
numbered
princes
in
the
train
of
her
admirers
for
the
brilliancy
of
her
attractions
such
as
they
at
present
shone
she
appealed
to
the
decision
of
her
minister
who
consulted
her
own
satisfaction
and
interest
by
flattering
the
other
vanity
and
resentment
and
so
unaccountable
did
the
depravity
of
our
hero
judgment
appear
to
this
conceited
dame
that
she
began
to
believe
there
was
some
mistake
in
the
person
and
to
hope
that
wilhelmina
gallant
was
not
in
reality
her
professed
admirer
fathom
but
rather
one
of
his
whose
passion
he
favoured
with
his
mediation
and
assistance
on
this
notion
which
nothing
but
mere
vanity
could
have
inspired
in
opposition
to
so
many
more
weighty
presumptions
she
took
the
resolution
of
bringing
the
affair
to
a
fuller
explanation
before
she
would
concert
any
measures
to
the
prejudice
of
our
adventurer
and
forthwith
despatched
her
spy
back
to
his
lodgings
to
solicit
on
the
part
of
wilhelmina
an
immediate
answer
to
the
letter
he
had
received
this
was
an
expedition
with
which
the
old
maiden
would
have
willingly
dispensed
because
it
was
founded
upon
an
uncertainty
which
might
be
attended
with
troublesome
consequences
but
rather
than
be
the
means
of
retarding
a
negotiation
so
productive
of
that
sort
of
mischief
which
is
particularly
agreeable
to
all
of
her
tribe
she
undertook
to
manage
and
effect
the
discovery
in
full
confidence
of
her
own
talents
and
experience
with
such
a
fund
of
and
instigation
she
repaired
to
the
academy
on
the
instant
and
inquiring
for
fathom
was
introduced
to
his
apartment
where
she
found
him
in
the
very
act
of
writing
a
billet
to
the
jeweller
daughter
the
artful
agent
having
asked
with
the
mysterious
air
of
an
expert
if
he
had
not
lately
received
a
message
from
a
certain
young
lady
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
herself
was
a
person
favoured
with
the
friendship
and
confidence
of
wilhelmina
whom
she
had
known
from
her
cradle
and
often
dandled
on
her
knee
then
in
the
genuine
style
of
a
prattling
dry
nurse
she
launched
out
in
encomiums
on
his
dulcinea
beauty
and
sweetness
of
temper
recounting
many
simple
occurrences
of
her
infancy
and
childhood
and
finally
desiring
a
more
circumstantial
answer
to
that
which
she
had
sent
to
him
by
her
friend
catherina
in
the
course
of
her
loquacity
she
had
also
according
to
her
instructions
hinted
at
the
misfortune
of
the
door
and
on
the
whole
performed
her
cue
with
such
dexterity
and
discretion
that
our
politician
was
actually
overreached
and
having
finished
his
epistle
committed
it
to
her
care
with
many
verbal
expressions
of
eternal
love
and
fidelity
to
his
charming
wilhelmina
the
messenger
doubly
rejoiced
at
her
achievement
which
not
only
recommended
her
ministry
but
also
gratified
her
malice
returned
to
her
principal
with
great
exultation
and
delivering
the
letter
the
reader
will
easily
conceive
the
transports
of
that
lady
when
she
read
the
contents
of
it
in
these
words
angelic
wilhelmina
to
forget
those
ecstatic
scenes
we
have
enjoyed
together
or
even
live
without
the
continuation
of
that
mutual
bliss
were
to
quit
all
title
to
perception
and
resign
every
hope
of
future
happiness
no
my
charmer
while
my
head
retains
the
least
spark
of
invention
and
my
heart
glows
with
the
resolution
of
a
man
our
correspondence
shall
not
be
cut
off
by
the
machinations
of
an
envious
stepmother
who
never
had
attractions
to
inspire
a
generous
passion
and
now
that
age
and
wrinkles
have
destroyed
what
little
share
of
beauty
she
once
possessed
endeavours
like
the
fiend
in
paradise
to
blast
those
joys
in
others
from
which
she
is
herself
eternally
excluded
doubt
not
dear
sovereign
of
my
soul
that
i
will
study
with
all
the
eagerness
of
desiring
love
how
to
frustrate
her
malicious
intention
and
renew
those
transporting
moments
the
remembrance
of
which
now
warms
the
breast
of
your
ever
constant
had
our
hero
murdered
her
father
or
left
her
a
disconsolate
widow
by
effecting
the
death
of
her
dear
husband
there
might
have
been
a
possibility
of
her
exerting
the
christian
virtues
of
resignation
and
forgiveness
but
such
a
personal
outrage
as
that
contained
in
this
epistle
precluded
all
hope
of
pardon
and
rendered
penitence
of
no
signification
his
atrocious
crime
being
now
fully
ascertained
this
virago
gave
a
loose
to
her
resentment
which
became
so
loud
and
tempestuous
that
her
informer
shuddered
at
the
storm
she
had
raised
and
began
to
repent
of
having
communicated
the
intelligence
which
seemed
to
have
such
a
violent
effect
upon
hex
brain
she
endeavoured
however
to
allay
the
agitation
by
flattering
her
fancy
with
the
prospect
of
revenge
and
gradually
soothed
her
into
a
state
of
deliberate
ire
during
which
she
determined
to
take
ample
vengeance
on
the
delinquent
in
the
zenith
of
her
rage
she
would
have
had
immediate
recourse
to
poison
or
steel
had
she
not
been
diverted
from
her
mortal
purpose
by
her
counsellor
who
represented
the
danger
of
engaging
in
such
violent
measures
and
proposed
a
more
secure
scheme
in
the
execution
of
which
she
would
see
the
perfidious
wretch
sufficiently
punished
without
any
hazard
to
her
own
person
or
reputation
she
advised
her
to
inform
the
jeweller
of
fathom
efforts
to
seduce
her
conjugal
fidelity
and
impart
to
him
a
plan
by
which
he
would
have
it
in
his
power
to
detect
our
adventurer
in
the
very
act
of
practising
upon
her
virtue
the
lady
relished
her
proposal
and
actually
resolved
to
make
an
assignation
with
ferdinand
as
usual
and
give
notice
of
the
appointment
to
her
husband
that
he
might
personally
discover
the
treachery
of
his
pretended
friend
and
inflict
upon
him
such
chastisement
as
the
brutal
disposition
should
suggest
when
inflamed
by
that
species
of
provocation
had
this
project
been
brought
to
bear
ferdinand
in
all
likelihood
would
have
been
disqualified
from
engaging
in
any
future
intrigue
but
fate
ordained
that
the
design
should
be
defeated
in
order
to
reserve
him
for
more
important
occasions
before
the
circumstances
of
the
plan
could
be
adjusted
it
was
his
good
fortune
to
meet
his
dulcinea
in
the
street
and
in
the
midst
of
their
mutual
condolence
on
the
interruption
they
had
suffered
in
their
correspondence
he
assured
her
that
he
would
never
give
his
invention
respite
until
he
should
have
verified
the
protestations
contained
in
the
letter
he
had
delivered
to
her
discreet
agent
this
allusion
to
a
billet
she
had
never
received
did
not
fail
to
alarm
her
fears
and
introduce
a
very
mortifying
explanation
in
which
he
so
accurately
described
the
person
of
the
messenger
that
she
forthwith
comprehended
the
plot
and
communicated
to
our
hero
her
sentiments
on
that
subject
though
he
expressed
infinite
anxiety
and
chagrin
at
this
misfortune
which
could
not
fail
to
raise
new
obstacles
to
their
love
his
heart
was
a
stranger
to
the
uneasiness
he
affected
and
rather
pleased
with
the
occasion
which
would
furnish
him
with
pretences
to
withdraw
himself
gradually
from
an
intercourse
by
this
time
become
equally
cloying
and
unprofitable
being
well
acquainted
with
the
mother
temperament
he
guessed
the
present
situation
of
her
thoughts
and
concluding
she
would
make
the
jeweller
a
party
in
her
revenge
he
resolved
from
that
moment
to
discontinue
his
visits
and
cautiously
guard
against
any
future
interview
with
the
lady
whom
he
had
rendered
so
implacable
it
was
well
for
our
adventurer
that
his
good
fortune
so
seasonably
interposed
for
that
same
day
in
the
afternoon
he
was
favoured
with
a
billet
from
the
jeweller
wife
couched
in
the
same
tender
style
she
had
formerly
used
and
importing
an
earnest
desire
of
seeing
him
next
day
at
the
wonted
rendezvous
although
his
penetration
was
sufficient
to
perceive
the
drift
of
this
message
or
at
least
to
discern
the
risk
he
should
run
in
complying
with
her
request
yet
he
was
willing
to
be
more
fully
certified
of
the
truth
of
his
suspicion
and
wrote
an
answer
to
the
billet
in
which
he
assured
her
that
he
would
repair
to
the
place
of
appointment
with
all
the
punctuality
of
an
impatient
lover
nevertheless
instead
of
performing
this
promise
he
in
the
morning
took
post
in
a
opposite
to
the
place
of
assignation
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
about
noon
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
german
wrapped
in
a
cloak
enter
the
door
of
his
though
the
appointment
was
fixed
at
five
in
the
evening
fathom
blessed
his
good
angel
for
having
conducted
him
clear
of
this
conspiracy
and
kept
his
station
with
great
tranquillity
till
the
hour
of
meeting
when
he
beheld
his
enraged
thalestris
take
the
same
route
and
enjoyed
her
disappointment
with
ineffable
satisfaction
thus
favoured
with
a
pretext
he
took
his
leave
of
her
in
a
letter
giving
her
to
understand
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
barbarous
snare
she
had
laid
for
him
and
upbraiding
her
with
having
made
such
an
ungrateful
return
for
all
his
tenderness
and
attachment
she
was
not
backward
in
conveying
a
reply
to
this
expostulation
which
seemed
to
have
been
dictated
in
all
the
distraction
of
a
proud
woman
who
sees
her
vengeance
baffled
as
well
as
her
love
disdained
her
letter
was
nothing
but
a
succession
of
reproaches
menaces
and
incoherent
execrations
she
taxed
him
with
knavery
insensibility
and
dissimulation
imprecated
a
thousand
curses
upon
his
head
and
threatened
not
only
to
persecute
his
life
with
all
the
arts
that
hell
and
malice
could
inspire
but
also
to
wound
him
in
the
person
of
her
who
should
be
enclosed
for
life
in
a
convent
where
she
should
have
leisure
to
repent
of
those
loose
and
disorderly
practices
which
he
had
taught
her
to
commit
and
of
which
she
could
not
pretend
innocence
as
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
confront
her
with
the
evidence
of
her
lover
own
confession
yet
all
this
denunciation
was
qualified
with
an
alternative
by
which
he
was
given
to
understand
that
the
gates
of
mercy
were
still
open
and
that
penitence
was
capable
of
washing
out
the
deepest
stain
of
guilt
ferdinand
read
the
whole
remonstrance
with
great
composure
and
moderation
and
was
content
to
incur
the
hazard
of
her
hate
rather
than
put
her
to
the
trouble
of
making
such
an
effort
of
generosity
as
would
induce
her
to
forgive
the
heinous
offence
he
had
committed
nor
did
his
apprehension
for
wilhelmina
in
the
least
influence
his
behaviour
on
this
occasion
so
zealous
was
he
for
her
spiritual
concerns
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
she
had
actually
taken
the
veil
but
he
knew
such
a
step
was
not
at
all
agreeable
to
her
disposition
and
that
no
violence
would
be
offered
to
her
inclinations
on
that
score
unless
her
stepmother
should
communicate
to
the
father
that
letter
of
fathom
which
she
had
intercepted
and
by
which
the
german
would
be
convinced
of
his
backsliding
but
this
measure
he
rightly
supposed
the
wife
would
not
venture
to
take
lest
the
husband
instead
of
taking
her
advice
touching
the
young
lady
should
seek
to
compromise
the
affair
by
offering
her
in
marriage
to
her
debaucher
a
proffer
which
if
accepted
would
overwhelm
the
mother
with
vexation
and
despair
he
therefore
chose
to
trust
to
the
effects
of
lenient
time
which
he
hoped
would
gradually
weaken
the
resentment
of
this
penthesilea
and
dissolve
his
connexion
with
the
other
parts
of
the
family
from
which
he
longed
to
be
totally
detached
how
well
soever
he
might
have
succeeded
in
his
attempts
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
mother
who
by
her
situation
in
life
was
restrained
from
prosecuting
those
measures
her
resentment
had
planned
against
his
fortitude
and
indifference
he
would
have
found
greater
difficulty
than
he
had
foreseen
in
disengaging
himself
from
the
daughter
whose
affections
he
had
won
under
the
most
solemn
professions
of
honour
and
fidelity
and
who
now
she
was
debarred
of
his
company
and
conversation
and
in
danger
of
losing
him
for
ever
had
actually
taken
the
resolution
of
disclosing
the
amour
to
her
father
that
he
might
interpose
in
behalf
of
her
peace
and
reputation
and
secure
her
happiness
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
chapter
eighteen
our
hero
departs
from
vienna
and
quits
the
domain
of
venus
for
the
rough
field
of
mars
luckily
for
our
adventurer
before
she
adhered
to
this
determination
the
young
count
de
melvil
was
summoned
to
presburg
by
his
father
who
desired
to
see
him
before
he
should
take
the
field
in
consequence
of
a
rupture
between
the
emperor
and
the
french
king
and
fathom
of
course
quitted
vienna
in
order
to
attend
his
patron
after
he
and
renaldo
had
resided
two
whole
years
in
that
capital
where
the
former
had
made
himself
perfect
in
all
the
polite
exercises
become
master
of
the
french
tongue
and
learned
to
speak
the
italian
with
great
facility
over
and
above
those
other
accomplishments
in
which
we
have
represented
him
as
an
inimitable
original
as
for
the
young
count
his
exteriors
were
so
much
improved
by
the
company
to
which
he
had
access
since
his
departure
from
his
house
that
his
parents
were
equally
surprised
and
overjoyed
at
the
alteration
all
that
awkwardness
and
rusticity
which
hung
upon
his
deportment
was
like
the
rough
coat
of
a
diamond
polished
away
the
connexion
and
disposition
of
his
limbs
seemed
to
have
been
adjusted
anew
his
carriage
was
become
easy
his
air
perfectly
genteel
and
his
conversation
gay
and
unrestrained
the
merit
of
this
reformation
was
in
a
great
measure
ascribed
to
the
care
and
example
of
fathom
who
was
received
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
with
marks
of
singular
friendship
and
esteem
nor
was
he
overlooked
by
mademoiselle
who
still
remained
in
a
state
of
celibacy
and
seemed
to
have
resigned
all
hope
of
altering
her
condition
she
expressed
uncommon
satisfaction
at
the
return
of
her
old
favourite
and
readmitted
him
into
the
same
degree
of
familiarity
with
which
he
had
been
honoured
before
his
departure
the
joy
of
teresa
was
so
excessive
at
his
arrival
that
she
could
scarce
suppress
her
raptures
so
as
to
conceal
them
from
the
notice
of
the
family
and
our
hero
upon
this
occasion
performed
the
part
of
an
exquisite
actor
in
dissembling
those
transports
which
his
bosom
never
knew
so
well
had
this
pupil
retained
the
lessons
of
her
instructor
that
in
the
midst
of
those
fraudulent
appropriations
which
she
still
continued
to
make
she
had
found
means
to
support
her
interest
and
character
with
mademoiselle
and
even
to
acquire
such
influence
in
the
family
that
no
other
servant
male
or
female
could
pretend
to
live
under
the
same
roof
without
paying
incessant
homage
to
this
artful
and
yielding
the
most
abject
submission
to
her
will
the
young
gentlemen
having
tarried
at
presburg
about
six
weeks
during
which
a
small
field
equipage
was
prepared
for
renaldo
they
repaired
to
the
camp
at
heilbron
under
the
auspices
of
count
melvil
in
whose
regiment
they
carried
arms
as
volunteers
with
a
view
to
merit
promotion
in
the
service
by
their
own
personal
behaviour
our
adventurer
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
this
occasion
of
signalising
himself
his
talents
being
much
better
adapted
to
another
sphere
of
life
nevertheless
he
affected
uncommon
alacrity
at
the
prospect
of
gathering
laurels
in
the
field
and
subscribed
to
his
fortune
with
a
good
grace
foreseeing
that
even
in
a
campaign
a
man
of
his
art
and
ingenuity
might
find
means
to
consult
his
corporal
safety
without
any
danger
to
his
reputation
accordingly
before
he
had
lived
full
three
weeks
in
camp
the
damp
situation
and
sudden
change
in
his
way
of
life
had
such
a
violent
effect
upon
his
constitution
that
he
was
deprived
of
the
use
of
all
his
limbs
and
mourned
without
ceasing
his
hard
fate
by
which
he
found
himself
precluded
from
all
opportunity
of
exerting
his
diligence
courage
and
activity
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
to
which
he
now
aspired
renaldo
who
was
actually
enamoured
of
a
martial
life
and
missed
no
occasion
of
distinguishing
himself
consoled
his
companion
with
great
cordiality
encouraged
him
with
the
hope
of
seeing
his
constitution
familiarised
to
the
inconveniences
of
a
camp
and
accommodated
him
with
everything
which
he
thought
would
alleviate
the
pain
of
his
body
as
well
as
the
anxiety
of
his
mind
the
old
count
who
sincerely
sympathised
with
his
affliction
would
have
persuaded
him
to
retire
into
quarters
where
he
could
be
carefully
nursed
and
provided
with
everything
necessary
to
a
person
in
his
condition
but
such
was
his
desire
of
glory
that
he
resisted
his
patron
importunities
with
great
constancy
till
at
length
seeing
the
old
gentleman
obstinately
determined
to
consult
his
health
by
removing
him
from
the
field
he
gradually
suffered
himself
to
recover
the
use
of
his
hands
made
shift
to
sit
up
in
his
bed
and
amuse
himself
with
cards
or
backgammon
and
notwithstanding
the
feeble
condition
of
his
legs
ventured
to
ride
out
on
horseback
to
visit
the
lines
though
the
count
and
his
son
would
never
yield
to
his
solicitations
so
far
as
to
let
him
accompany
renaldo
in
those
excursions
and
reconnoitring
parties
by
which
a
volunteer
inures
himself
to
toil
and
peril
and
acquires
that
knowledge
in
the
operations
of
war
which
qualifies
him
for
a
command
in
the
service
notwithstanding
this
exemption
from
all
duty
our
adventurer
managed
matters
so
as
to
pass
for
a
youth
of
infinite
mettle
and
even
rendered
his
backwardness
and
timidity
subservient
to
the
support
of
that
character
by
expressing
an
impatience
of
lying
inactive
and
a
desire
of
signalising
his
prowess
which
even
the
disabled
condition
of
his
body
could
scarce
restrain
he
must
be
a
man
of
very
weak
nerves
and
excessive
irresolution
who
can
live
in
the
midst
of
actual
service
without
imbibing
some
portion
of
military
fortitude
danger
becomes
habitual
and
loses
a
great
part
of
its
terror
and
as
fear
is
often
caught
by
contagion
so
is
courage
communicated
among
the
individuals
of
an
army
the
hope
of
fame
desire
of
honours
and
preferment
envy
emulation
and
the
dread
of
disgrace
are
motives
which
in
suppressing
that
aversion
to
death
or
mutilation
which
nature
hath
implanted
in
the
human
mind
and
therefore
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
fathom
who
was
naturally
gained
some
advantages
over
his
disposition
before
the
end
of
the
campaign
which
happened
to
be
neither
perilous
nor
severe
during
the
winter
while
both
armies
remained
in
quarters
our
adventurer
attended
his
patron
to
presburg
and
before
the
troops
were
in
motion
renaldo
obtained
a
commission
in
consequence
of
which
he
went
into
garrison
at
philipsburg
whither
he
was
followed
by
our
hero
while
the
old
count
duty
called
him
to
the
field
in
a
different
place
ferdinand
for
some
time
had
no
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
this
disposition
by
which
he
was
at
once
delivered
from
the
fatigues
of
a
campaign
and
the
inspection
of
a
severe
censor
in
the
person
of
count
melvil
and
his
satisfaction
was
still
increased
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
tyrolese
who
had
been
his
confederate
at
vienna
and
now
chanced
to
serve
in
garrison
on
the
same
footing
with
himself
these
two
renewed
their
former
correspondence
and
as
all
soldiers
are
addicted
to
gaming
levied
contributions
upon
all
those
officers
who
had
money
to
lose
and
temerity
to
play
however
they
had
not
long
pursued
this
branch
of
traffic
when
their
success
was
interrupted
by
a
very
serious
occurrence
that
for
the
present
entirely
detached
the
gentlemen
in
the
garrison
from
such
amusements
the
french
troops
invested
fort
kehl
situated
on
the
rhine
opposite
to
strasburg
and
the
imperialists
dreading
that
the
next
storm
would
fall
upon
philipsburg
employed
themselves
with
great
diligence
to
put
that
important
fortress
in
a
proper
posture
of
defence
if
the
suspension
of
play
was
displeasing
to
our
hero
the
expectation
of
being
besieged
was
by
no
means
more
agreeable
he
knew
the
excellence
of
the
french
engineers
the
power
of
their
artillery
and
the
perseverance
of
their
general
he
felt
by
anticipation
the
toils
of
hard
duty
upon
the
works
the
horrors
of
cannonading
bombardment
sallies
and
mines
blown
up
and
deliberated
with
himself
whether
or
not
he
should
privately
withdraw
and
take
refuge
among
the
besiegers
but
when
he
reflected
that
such
a
step
besides
the
infamy
that
must
attend
it
would
be
like
that
of
running
upon
scylla
seeking
to
avoid
charybdis
as
he
would
be
exposed
to
more
danger
and
inconvenience
in
the
trenches
than
he
could
possibly
undergo
in
the
town
and
after
all
run
the
risk
of
being
taken
and
treated
as
a
deserter
upon
these
considerations
he
resolved
to
submit
himself
to
his
destiny
and
endeavoured
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
his
fate
by
those
arts
he
had
formerly
practised
with
success
he
accordingly
found
means
to
enjoy
a
very
bad
state
of
health
during
the
whole
siege
which
lasted
about
six
weeks
after
the
trenches
were
opened
and
then
the
garrison
marched
out
by
capitulation
with
all
the
honours
of
war
chapter
nineteen
he
puts
himself
under
the
guidance
of
his
associate
and
stumbles
upon
the
french
camp
where
he
finishes
his
military
career
nothing
else
of
moment
was
transacted
during
that
campaign
and
in
the
winter
our
adventurer
with
the
young
count
and
his
friend
the
tyrolese
were
disposed
in
quarters
of
cantonment
where
ferdinand
made
himself
amends
for
the
chagrin
he
had
undergone
by
the
exercise
of
those
talents
in
which
he
excelled
not
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
sphere
of
life
in
which
he
acted
though
he
knew
himself
consummate
in
the
art
of
play
he
was
not
at
all
ambitious
of
a
gamester
name
nor
did
he
find
himself
disposed
to
hazard
those
discoveries
and
explanations
to
which
heroes
of
that
class
are
sometimes
necessarily
exposed
his
aim
was
to
dwell
among
the
tents
of
civil
life
undisturbed
by
quarrels
and
the
din
of
war
and
render
mankind
subservient
to
his
interest
not
by
stratagems
which
irritate
but
by
that
suppleness
of
insinuation
which
could
not
fail
to
soothe
the
temper
of
those
on
whom
he
meant
to
prey
he
saw
that
all
his
expectations
of
count
melvil
future
favour
were
connected
with
his
choice
of
a
military
life
and
that
his
promotion
in
the
service
would
in
a
great
measure
depend
upon
his
personal
behaviour
in
such
emergencies
as
he
did
not
at
all
wish
to
encounter
on
the
other
hand
he
confided
so
much
in
his
own
dexterity
and
address
that
he
never
doubted
of
being
able
to
rear
a
splendid
fortune
for
himself
provided
he
could
once
obtain
a
fixed
and
firm
foundation
he
had
in
fancy
often
enjoyed
a
prospect
of
england
not
only
as
his
native
country
to
which
like
a
true
citizen
he
longed
to
be
united
but
also
as
the
land
of
promise
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
abounding
with
subjects
on
which
he
knew
his
talents
would
be
properly
exercised
these
reflections
never
occurred
without
leaving
a
strong
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
which
influenced
his
deliberations
in
such
a
manner
as
at
length
amounted
to
a
perfect
resolution
of
withdrawing
himself
privately
from
a
service
that
teemed
with
disagreeable
events
and
of
transporting
himself
into
the
country
of
his
ancestors
which
he
considered
as
the
canaan
of
all
able
adventurers
but
previous
to
his
appearance
on
that
stage
he
was
desirous
of
visiting
the
metropolis
of
france
in
which
he
hoped
to
improve
himself
in
the
knowledge
of
men
and
things
and
acquire
such
intelligence
as
would
qualify
him
to
act
a
more
important
part
upon
the
british
scene
after
having
for
some
time
indulged
these
prospects
in
secret
he
determined
to
accommodate
himself
with
the
company
and
experience
of
the
tyrolese
whom
under
the
specious
title
of
an
associate
he
knew
he
could
convert
into
a
very
serviceable
tool
in
forwarding
the
execution
of
his
own
projects
accordingly
the
inclination
of
this
confederate
was
sounded
by
distant
hints
and
being
found
apt
our
hero
made
him
privy
to
his
design
of
decamping
without
beat
of
drum
though
at
the
same
time
he
begged
his
advice
touching
the
method
of
their
departure
that
he
might
retire
with
as
much
delicacy
as
the
nature
of
such
a
step
would
permit
divers
consultations
were
held
upon
this
subject
before
they
adhered
to
the
resolution
of
making
their
escape
from
the
army
after
it
should
have
taken
the
field
in
the
spring
because
in
that
case
they
would
have
frequent
opportunities
of
going
abroad
on
foraging
parties
and
during
one
of
these
excursions
might
retire
in
such
a
manner
as
to
persuade
their
companions
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
agreeable
to
this
determination
the
camp
was
no
sooner
formed
in
alsace
than
our
associates
began
to
make
preparations
for
their
march
and
had
already
taken
all
the
previous
measures
for
their
departure
when
an
accident
happened
which
our
hero
did
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
advantage
this
was
no
other
than
the
desertion
of
renaldo
valet
who
in
consequence
of
a
gentle
chastisement
which
he
had
richly
merited
thought
proper
to
disappear
after
having
plundered
his
portmanteau
which
he
had
forced
open
for
the
purpose
ferdinand
who
was
the
first
person
that
discovered
the
theft
immediately
comprehended
the
whole
adventure
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
delinquent
would
never
return
resolved
to
finish
what
the
fugitive
had
imperfectly
performed
being
favoured
with
the
unreserved
confidence
of
the
young
count
he
instantly
had
recourse
to
his
bureau
the
locks
of
which
he
found
means
to
burst
open
and
examining
a
private
drawer
contrived
with
great
art
to
conceal
renaldo
jewels
and
cash
made
himself
master
of
the
contents
without
hesitation
then
cutting
open
his
and
strewing
the
tent
with
his
linen
and
clothes
began
to
raise
his
voice
and
produce
such
a
clamour
as
alarmed
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
brought
a
great
many
officers
into
the
tent
he
on
this
as
on
all
other
occasions
performed
his
cue
to
a
miracle
expressing
confusion
and
concern
so
naturally
in
his
gestures
and
exclamation
that
no
man
could
possibly
suspect
his
sincerity
nay
to
such
a
degree
of
finesse
did
his
cunning
amount
that
when
his
friend
and
patron
entered
in
consequence
of
an
intimation
he
soon
received
of
his
loss
our
adventurer
exhibited
undoubted
signs
of
distraction
and
delirium
and
springing
upon
renaldo
with
all
the
frantic
fury
of
a
bedlamite
villain
cried
he
restore
the
effects
you
have
stole
from
your
master
or
you
shall
be
immediately
committed
to
the
care
of
the
however
mortified
de
melvil
might
be
at
his
own
misfortune
the
condition
of
his
friend
seemed
to
touch
him
more
nearly
he
undervalued
his
own
loss
as
a
trifle
that
could
be
easily
repaired
said
everything
which
he
thought
would
tend
to
soothe
and
compose
the
agitation
of
ferdinand
and
finally
prevailed
upon
him
to
retire
to
rest
the
calamity
was
wholly
attributed
to
the
deserter
and
renaldo
far
from
suspecting
the
true
author
took
occasion
from
his
behaviour
on
this
emergency
to
admire
him
as
a
mirror
of
integrity
and
attachment
in
such
an
exquisite
manner
did
he
plan
all
his
designs
that
almost
every
instance
of
his
fraud
furnished
matter
of
triumph
to
his
reputation
having
thus
profitably
exercised
his
genius
this
subtle
politician
thought
it
high
time
to
relinquish
his
military
expectations
and
securing
all
his
valuable
acquisitions
about
his
own
person
rode
out
with
his
understrapper
in
the
midst
of
fifty
dragoons
who
went
in
quest
of
forage
while
the
troopers
were
employed
in
making
up
their
trusses
the
two
adventurers
advanced
towards
the
skirt
of
a
wood
on
pretence
of
reconnoitring
and
the
tyrolese
who
undertook
to
be
our
hero
guide
directing
him
to
a
path
which
leads
towards
strasburg
they
suddenly
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
their
companions
who
in
a
few
minutes
hearing
the
report
of
several
pistols
which
the
confederates
purposely
fired
conjectured
that
they
had
fallen
in
with
a
party
of
french
by
whom
they
were
made
prisoners
of
war
the
tyrolese
had
overrated
his
own
knowledge
when
he
took
upon
himself
the
charge
of
conducting
our
hero
for
upon
their
arrival
at
a
certain
place
where
two
roads
crossed
each
other
he
chanced
to
follow
that
which
not
only
frustrated
their
intention
but
even
led
them
directly
to
the
french
camp
so
that
in
the
twilight
they
fell
in
upon
one
of
the
outguards
before
they
were
aware
of
their
mistake
whatever
confusion
and
perplexity
they
might
undergo
when
they
heard
themselves
questioned
by
the
sentinel
on
the
advanced
post
certain
it
is
they
betrayed
no
symptoms
of
fear
or
disorder
but
while
ferdinand
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
his
with
the
appearance
of
admirable
intrepidity
and
presence
of
mind
told
the
soldier
that
he
and
his
companion
were
two
gentlemen
of
family
who
had
quitted
the
austrian
army
on
account
of
having
sustained
some
which
they
had
no
opportunity
of
resenting
in
any
other
way
and
that
they
were
come
to
offer
their
services
to
the
french
general
to
whose
quarters
they
desired
to
be
immediately
conveyed
the
sentinel
to
whom
such
an
instance
of
desertion
was
neither
rare
nor
indeed
uncommon
directed
them
without
scruple
to
the
next
post
where
they
found
a
serjeant
party
from
which
at
their
request
they
were
transmitted
to
the
officer
of
the
grand
guard
and
by
him
next
morning
introduced
to
count
coigny
who
very
politely
received
them
as
volunteers
in
the
army
of
france
though
this
translation
was
not
at
all
to
our
hero
liking
he
was
forced
to
acquiesce
in
his
fate
glad
to
find
himself
on
these
terms
in
possession
of
his
effects
of
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
infallibly
rifled
this
campaign
however
was
the
most
disagreeable
period
of
his
whole
life
because
the
manner
in
which
he
had
entered
into
the
service
subjected
him
to
the
particular
observation
and
notice
of
the
french
officers
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
very
alert
in
his
duty
and
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
maintain
the
character
he
had
assumed
what
rendered
his
situation
still
more
unpalatable
was
the
activity
of
both
armies
in
the
course
of
this
season
during
which
over
and
above
sundry
fatiguing
marches
and
countermarches
he
was
personally
engaged
in
the
affair
of
halleh
which
was
very
obstinate
where
being
in
the
skirts
of
the
detachment
he
was
actually
wounded
in
the
face
by
the
sword
of
an
hussar
but
this
was
luckily
for
him
the
last
time
he
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
exerting
his
military
prowess
for
a
cessation
of
arms
was
proclaimed
before
he
was
cured
of
his
wound
and
peace
concluded
about
the
end
of
the
campaign
during
his
sojourn
in
the
french
camp
he
assumed
the
character
of
a
man
of
family
who
being
disgusted
at
some
supercilious
treatment
he
had
met
with
in
the
german
service
and
at
the
same
time
ambitious
of
carrying
arms
under
the
banners
of
france
took
the
opportunity
of
retreating
by
stealth
from
his
friends
accompanied
only
by
one
with
whom
he
could
intrust
his
intention
in
this
capacity
he
had
managed
his
matters
to
such
advantage
that
many
french
officers
of
rank
were
very
well
disposed
to
contribute
their
interest
in
his
behalf
had
his
inclination
verged
towards
promotion
in
the
army
but
he
thought
proper
to
conceal
his
real
design
under
the
specious
pretext
of
longing
to
see
the
metropolis
of
france
that
centre
of
pleasure
and
politeness
in
which
he
proposed
to
spend
some
time
for
the
improvement
of
his
address
and
understanding
these
were
motives
too
laudable
to
be
opposed
by
his
new
patrons
some
of
whom
furnished
him
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
certain
noblemen
of
the
first
rank
at
the
court
of
versailles
for
which
place
he
and
his
companion
set
out
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
very
well
satisfied
with
the
honourable
dismission
they
had
obtained
from
a
life
of
inconvenience
danger
and
alarm
chapter
twenty
he
prepares
a
stratagem
but
finds
himself
countermined
proceeds
on
his
journey
and
is
overtaken
by
a
terrible
tempest
in
the
course
of
this
journey
ferdinand
who
was
never
deficient
in
his
political
capacity
held
a
secret
conclave
with
his
own
thoughts
not
only
touching
the
plan
of
his
own
future
conduct
but
also
concerning
his
associate
of
whose
fidelity
and
adherence
he
began
to
entertain
such
doubts
as
discouraged
him
from
the
prosecution
of
that
design
in
which
the
tyrolese
had
been
at
first
included
for
he
had
lately
observed
him
practise
the
arts
of
his
occupation
among
the
french
officers
with
such
rapacity
and
want
of
caution
as
indicated
a
dangerous
temerity
of
temper
as
well
as
a
furious
rage
of
acquiring
which
might
be
some
time
or
other
satiated
upon
his
own
friends
in
other
words
our
adventurer
was
afraid
that
his
accomplice
would
profit
by
his
knowledge
of
the
road
and
countries
through
which
they
travelled
and
after
having
made
free
with
his
most
valuable
effects
in
consequence
of
the
familiarity
subsisting
between
them
leave
him
some
morning
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
adieu
aroused
by
this
suspicion
he
resolved
to
anticipate
the
supposed
intention
of
the
tyrolese
by
taking
his
own
departure
in
the
same
abrupt
manner
and
this
scheme
he
actually
put
in
execution
upon
their
arrival
in
where
it
was
agreed
they
should
spend
a
day
to
repose
and
refresh
themselves
from
the
fatigue
of
hard
riding
ferdinand
therefore
taking
the
advantage
of
his
companion
absence
for
the
tyrolese
had
walked
abroad
to
view
the
town
found
means
to
hire
a
peasant
who
undertook
to
conduct
him
through
a
as
far
as
chalons
and
with
his
guide
he
accordingly
set
out
on
horseback
after
having
discharged
the
bill
left
a
blank
paper
sealed
up
in
form
of
a
letter
directed
to
his
friend
and
secured
behind
his
own
saddle
a
pair
of
leathern
bags
in
which
his
jewels
and
cash
were
usually
contained
so
eager
was
our
hero
to
leave
the
tyrolese
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
that
he
rode
all
night
at
a
round
pace
without
halting
and
next
morning
found
himself
at
a
village
distant
thirteen
good
leagues
from
any
part
of
the
route
which
he
and
his
companion
had
at
first
resolved
to
pursue
here
thinking
himself
safely
delivered
from
the
cause
of
all
his
apprehension
he
determined
to
lie
incognito
for
a
few
days
so
as
that
he
might
run
no
risk
of
an
accidental
meeting
upon
the
road
with
the
person
whose
company
he
had
forsaken
and
accordingly
took
possession
of
an
apartment
in
which
he
went
to
rest
desiring
his
guide
to
wake
him
when
dinner
should
be
ready
having
enjoyed
a
very
comfortable
refreshment
of
sleep
with
his
bags
under
his
pillow
he
was
summoned
according
to
his
direction
and
ate
a
very
hearty
meal
with
great
tranquillity
and
internal
satisfaction
in
the
afternoon
he
amused
himself
with
happy
presages
and
ideal
prospects
of
his
future
fortune
and
in
the
midst
of
these
imaginary
banquets
was
seized
with
an
inclination
of
realising
his
bliss
and
regaling
his
eyesight
with
the
fruits
of
that
success
which
had
hitherto
attended
his
endeavours
thus
inflamed
he
opened
the
repository
and
o
reader
what
were
his
reflections
when
in
lieu
of
mademoiselle
melvil
and
necklace
the
german
golden
chain
divers
jewels
of
considerable
value
the
spoils
of
sundry
dupes
and
about
two
hundred
ducats
in
ready
money
he
found
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
parcel
of
rusty
nails
disposed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
resemble
in
weight
and
bulk
the
moveables
he
had
lost
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
our
adventurer
made
this
discovery
without
emotion
if
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
could
have
been
purchased
for
the
tenth
part
of
his
treasure
he
would
have
left
the
whole
species
in
a
state
of
reprobation
rather
than
redeem
them
at
that
price
unless
he
had
seen
in
the
bargain
some
evident
advantage
to
his
own
concerns
one
may
therefore
easily
conceive
with
what
milkiness
of
resignation
he
bore
the
loss
of
the
whole
and
saw
himself
reduced
from
such
affluence
to
the
necessity
of
depending
upon
about
twenty
ducats
and
some
loose
silver
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
for
his
expense
upon
the
road
however
bitter
this
pill
might
be
in
swallowing
he
so
far
mastered
his
mortification
as
to
digest
it
with
a
good
grace
his
own
penetration
at
once
pointed
out
the
canal
through
which
this
misfortune
had
flowed
upon
him
he
forthwith
placed
the
calamity
to
the
account
of
the
tyrolese
and
never
doubting
that
he
had
retired
with
the
booty
across
the
rhine
into
some
place
to
which
he
knew
fathom
would
not
follow
his
footsteps
he
formed
the
melancholy
resolution
of
pursuing
with
all
despatch
his
journey
to
paris
that
he
might
with
all
convenient
expedition
indemnify
himself
for
the
discomfiture
he
had
sustained
with
regard
to
his
confederate
his
conjecture
was
perfectly
right
that
adventurer
though
infinitely
inferior
to
our
hero
in
point
of
genius
and
invention
had
manifestly
the
advantage
of
him
in
the
articles
of
age
and
experience
he
was
no
stranger
to
fathom
qualifications
the
happy
exertion
of
which
he
had
often
seen
he
knew
him
to
be
an
economist
of
the
most
frugal
order
consequently
concluded
his
finances
were
worthy
of
examination
and
upon
the
true
principles
of
a
sharper
eased
him
of
the
encumbrance
taking
it
for
granted
that
in
so
doing
he
only
precluded
ferdinand
from
the
power
of
acting
the
same
tragedy
upon
him
should
ever
opportunity
concur
with
his
inclination
he
had
therefore
concerted
his
measures
with
the
dexterity
of
an
experienced
conveyancer
and
snatching
the
occasion
while
our
hero
lay
sunk
in
the
arms
of
profound
repose
he
ripped
up
the
seams
of
the
leather
depository
withdrew
the
contents
introduced
the
parcel
of
nails
which
he
had
made
up
for
the
purpose
and
then
repaired
the
breach
with
great
deliberation
had
fathom
good
genius
prompted
him
to
examine
his
effects
next
morning
the
tyrolese
in
all
probability
would
have
maintained
his
acquisition
by
force
of
arms
for
his
personal
courage
was
rather
more
determined
than
that
of
our
adventurer
and
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
ascendency
in
this
particular
but
his
good
fortune
prevented
such
explanation
immediately
after
dinner
he
availed
himself
of
his
knowledge
and
betaking
himself
to
a
remote
part
of
the
town
set
out
in
a
for
luneville
while
our
hero
was
meditating
his
own
escape
fathom
conception
was
sufficient
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
this
adventure
as
soon
as
his
chagrin
would
give
his
sagacity
fair
play
nor
would
he
allow
his
resolution
to
sink
under
the
trial
on
the
contrary
he
departed
from
the
village
that
same
afternoon
under
the
auspices
of
his
conductor
and
found
himself
benighted
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
far
from
the
habitations
of
men
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
place
the
indistinct
images
of
the
trees
that
appeared
on
every
side
stretching
their
extravagant
arms
athwart
the
gloom
conspired
with
the
dejection
of
spirits
occasioned
by
his
loss
to
disturb
his
fancy
and
raise
strange
phantoms
in
his
imagination
although
he
was
not
naturally
superstitious
his
mind
began
to
be
invaded
with
an
awful
horror
that
gradually
prevailed
over
all
the
consolations
of
reason
and
philosophy
nor
was
his
heart
free
from
the
terrors
of
assassination
in
order
to
dissipate
these
disagreeable
reveries
he
had
recourse
to
the
conversation
of
his
guide
by
whom
he
was
entertained
with
the
history
of
divers
travellers
who
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
by
ruffians
whose
retreat
was
in
the
recesses
of
that
very
wood
in
the
midst
of
this
communication
which
did
not
at
all
tend
to
the
elevation
of
our
hero
spirits
the
conductor
made
an
excuse
for
dropping
behind
while
our
traveller
jogged
on
in
expectation
of
being
joined
again
by
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
however
disappointed
in
that
hope
the
sound
of
the
other
horse
feet
by
degrees
grew
more
and
more
faint
and
at
last
altogether
died
away
alarmed
at
this
circumstance
fathom
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
listened
with
the
most
fearful
attention
but
his
sense
of
hearing
was
saluted
with
nought
but
the
dismal
sighings
of
the
trees
that
seemed
to
foretell
an
approaching
storm
accordingly
the
heavens
contracted
a
more
dreary
aspect
the
lightning
began
to
gleam
and
the
thunder
to
roll
and
the
tempest
raising
its
voice
to
a
tremendous
roar
descended
in
a
torrent
of
rain
in
this
emergency
the
fortitude
of
our
hero
was
almost
quite
overcome
so
many
concurring
circumstances
of
danger
and
distress
might
have
appalled
the
most
undaunted
breast
what
impression
then
must
they
have
made
upon
the
mind
of
ferdinand
who
was
by
no
means
a
man
to
set
fear
at
defiance
indeed
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
reflection
and
was
actually
invaded
to
the
skin
before
he
could
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
quit
the
road
and
seek
for
shelter
among
the
thickets
that
surrounded
him
having
rode
some
furlongs
into
the
forest
he
took
his
station
under
a
tuft
of
tall
trees
that
screened
him
from
the
storm
and
in
that
situation
called
a
council
within
himself
to
deliberate
upon
his
next
excursion
he
persuaded
himself
that
his
guide
had
deserted
him
for
the
present
in
order
to
give
intelligence
of
a
traveller
to
some
gang
of
robbers
with
whom
he
was
connected
and
that
he
must
of
necessity
fall
a
prey
to
those
banditti
unless
he
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
elude
their
search
and
disentangle
himself
from
the
mazes
of
the
wood
harrowed
with
these
apprehensions
he
resolved
to
commit
himself
to
the
mercy
of
the
hurricane
as
of
two
evils
the
least
and
penetrate
straightforwards
through
some
devious
opening
until
he
should
be
delivered
from
the
forest
for
this
purpose
he
turned
his
horse
head
in
a
line
quite
contrary
to
the
direction
of
the
high
road
which
he
had
left
on
the
supposition
that
the
robbers
would
pursue
that
track
in
quest
of
him
and
that
they
would
never
dream
of
his
deserting
the
highway
to
traverse
an
unknown
forest
amidst
the
darkness
of
such
a
boisterous
night
after
he
had
continued
in
this
progress
through
a
succession
of
groves
and
bogs
and
thorns
and
brakes
by
which
not
only
his
clothes
but
also
his
skin
suffered
in
a
grievous
manner
while
every
nerve
quivered
with
eagerness
and
dismay
he
at
length
reached
an
open
plain
and
pursuing
his
course
in
full
hope
of
arriving
at
some
village
where
his
life
would
be
safe
he
descried
a
at
a
distance
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
star
of
his
good
fortune
and
riding
towards
it
at
full
speed
arrived
at
the
door
of
a
lone
cottage
into
which
he
was
admitted
by
an
old
woman
who
understanding
he
was
a
bewildered
traveller
received
him
with
great
hospitality
when
he
learned
from
his
hostess
that
there
was
not
another
house
within
three
leagues
that
she
could
accommodate
him
with
a
tolerable
bed
and
his
horse
with
lodging
and
oats
he
thanked
heaven
for
his
good
fortune
in
stumbling
upon
this
homely
habitation
and
determined
to
pass
the
night
under
the
protection
of
the
old
cottager
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
husband
who
was
a
had
gone
to
the
next
town
to
dispose
of
his
merchandise
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
not
return
till
next
morning
on
account
of
the
tempestuous
night
ferdinand
sounded
the
beldame
with
a
thousand
artful
interrogations
and
she
answered
with
such
appearance
of
truth
and
simplicity
that
he
concluded
his
person
was
quite
secure
and
after
having
been
regaled
with
a
dish
of
eggs
and
bacon
desired
she
would
conduct
him
into
the
chamber
where
she
proposed
he
should
take
his
repose
he
was
accordingly
ushered
up
by
a
sort
of
ladder
into
an
apartment
furnished
with
a
and
almost
half
filled
with
trusses
of
straw
he
seemed
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
lodging
which
in
reality
exceeded
his
expectation
and
his
kind
landlady
cautioning
him
against
letting
the
candle
approach
the
combustibles
took
her
leave
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
chapter
he
falls
upon
scylla
seeking
to
avoid
charybdis
fathom
whose
own
principles
taught
him
to
be
suspicious
and
ever
upon
his
guard
against
the
treachery
of
his
could
have
dispensed
with
this
instance
of
her
care
in
confining
her
guest
to
her
chamber
and
began
to
be
seized
with
strange
fancies
when
he
observed
that
there
was
no
bolt
on
the
inside
of
the
door
by
which
he
might
secure
himself
from
intrusion
in
consequence
of
these
suggestions
he
proposed
to
take
an
accurate
survey
of
every
object
in
the
apartment
and
in
the
course
of
his
inquiry
had
the
mortification
to
find
the
dead
body
of
a
man
still
warm
who
had
been
lately
stabbed
and
concealed
beneath
several
bundles
of
straw
such
a
discovery
could
not
fail
to
fill
the
breast
of
our
hero
with
unspeakable
horror
for
he
concluded
that
he
himself
would
undergo
the
same
fate
before
morning
without
the
interposition
of
a
miracle
in
his
favour
in
the
first
transports
of
his
dread
he
ran
to
the
window
with
a
view
to
escape
by
that
outlet
and
found
his
flight
effectually
obstructed
by
divers
strong
bars
of
iron
then
his
heart
began
to
palpitate
his
hair
to
bristle
up
and
his
knees
to
totter
his
thoughts
teemed
with
presages
of
death
and
destruction
his
conscience
rose
up
in
judgment
against
him
and
he
underwent
a
severe
paroxysm
of
dismay
and
distraction
his
spirits
were
agitated
into
a
state
of
fermentation
that
produced
a
species
of
resolution
akin
to
that
which
is
inspired
by
brandy
or
other
strong
liquors
and
by
an
impulse
that
seemed
supernatural
he
was
immediately
hurried
into
measures
for
his
own
preservation
what
upon
a
less
interesting
occasion
his
imagination
durst
not
propose
he
now
executed
without
scruple
or
remorse
he
undressed
the
corpse
that
lay
bleeding
among
the
straw
and
conveying
it
to
the
bed
in
his
arms
deposited
it
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
who
sleeps
at
his
ease
then
he
extinguished
the
light
took
possession
of
the
place
from
whence
the
body
had
been
removed
and
holding
a
pistol
ready
cocked
in
each
hand
waited
for
the
sequel
with
that
determined
purpose
which
is
often
the
immediate
production
of
despair
about
midnight
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
ascending
the
ladder
the
door
was
softly
opened
he
saw
the
shadow
of
two
men
stalking
towards
the
bed
a
dark
lanthorn
being
unshrouded
directed
their
aim
to
the
supposed
sleeper
and
he
that
held
it
thrust
a
poniard
to
his
heart
the
force
of
the
blow
made
a
compression
on
the
chest
and
a
sort
of
groan
issued
from
the
windpipe
of
the
defunct
the
stroke
was
repeated
without
producing
a
repetition
of
the
note
so
that
the
assassins
concluded
the
work
was
effectually
done
and
retired
for
the
present
with
a
design
to
return
and
rifle
the
deceased
at
their
leisure
never
had
our
hero
spent
a
moment
in
such
agony
as
he
felt
during
this
operation
the
whole
surface
of
his
body
was
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
and
his
nerves
were
relaxed
with
an
universal
palsy
in
short
he
remained
in
a
trance
that
in
all
probability
contributed
to
his
safety
for
had
he
retained
the
use
of
his
senses
he
might
have
been
discovered
by
the
transports
of
his
fear
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
retrieved
recollection
was
to
perceive
that
the
assassins
had
left
the
door
open
in
their
retreat
and
he
would
have
instantly
availed
himself
of
this
their
neglect
by
sallying
out
upon
them
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
had
he
not
been
restrained
by
a
conversation
he
overheard
in
the
room
below
importing
that
the
ruffians
were
going
to
set
out
upon
another
expedition
in
hopes
of
finding
more
prey
they
accordingly
departed
after
having
laid
strong
injunctions
upon
the
old
woman
to
keep
the
door
fast
locked
during
their
absence
and
ferdinand
took
his
resolution
without
farther
delay
so
soon
as
by
his
conjecture
the
robbers
were
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
house
he
rose
from
his
moved
softly
towards
the
bed
and
rummaging
the
pockets
of
the
deceased
found
a
purse
well
stored
with
ducats
of
which
together
with
a
silver
watch
and
a
diamond
ring
he
immediately
possessed
himself
without
scruple
then
descending
with
great
care
and
circumspection
into
the
lower
apartment
stood
before
the
old
beldame
before
she
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
approach
accustomed
as
she
was
to
the
trade
of
blood
the
hoary
hag
did
not
behold
this
apparition
without
giving
signs
of
infinite
terror
and
astonishment
believing
it
was
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
her
second
guest
who
had
been
murdered
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
began
to
recommend
herself
to
the
protection
of
the
saints
crossing
herself
with
as
much
devotion
as
if
she
had
been
entitled
to
the
particular
care
and
attention
of
heaven
nor
did
her
anxiety
abate
when
she
was
undeceived
in
this
her
supposition
and
understood
it
was
no
phantom
but
the
real
substance
of
the
stranger
who
without
staying
to
upbraid
her
with
the
enormity
of
her
crimes
commanded
her
on
pain
of
immediate
death
to
produce
his
horse
to
which
being
conducted
he
set
her
upon
the
saddle
without
delay
and
mounting
behind
invested
her
with
the
management
of
the
reins
swearing
in
a
most
peremptory
tone
that
the
only
chance
she
had
for
her
life
was
in
directing
him
safely
to
the
next
town
and
that
so
soon
as
she
should
give
him
the
least
cause
to
doubt
her
fidelity
in
the
performance
of
that
task
he
would
on
the
instant
act
the
part
of
her
executioner
this
declaration
had
its
effect
upon
the
withered
hecate
who
with
many
supplications
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
promised
to
guide
him
in
safety
to
a
certain
village
at
the
distance
of
two
leagues
where
he
might
lodge
in
security
and
be
provided
with
a
fresh
horse
or
other
convenience
for
pursuing
his
intended
route
on
these
conditions
he
told
her
she
might
deserve
his
clemency
and
they
accordingly
took
their
departure
together
she
being
placed
astride
upon
the
saddle
holding
the
bridle
in
one
hand
and
a
switch
in
the
other
and
our
adventurer
sitting
on
the
crupper
superintending
her
conduct
and
keeping
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
close
at
her
ear
in
this
equipage
they
travelled
across
part
of
the
same
wood
in
which
his
guide
had
forsaken
him
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
passed
his
time
in
the
most
agreeable
reverie
while
he
found
himself
involved
in
the
labyrinth
of
those
shades
which
he
considered
as
the
haunts
of
robbery
and
assassination
common
fear
was
a
comfortable
sensation
to
what
he
felt
in
this
excursion
the
first
steps
he
had
taken
for
his
preservation
were
the
effects
of
mere
instinct
while
his
faculties
were
extinguished
or
suppressed
by
despair
but
now
as
his
reflection
began
to
recur
he
was
haunted
by
the
most
intolerable
apprehensions
every
whisper
of
the
wind
through
the
thickets
was
swelled
into
the
hoarse
menaces
of
murder
the
shaking
of
the
boughs
was
construed
into
the
brandishing
of
poniards
and
every
shadow
of
a
tree
became
the
apparition
of
a
ruffian
eager
for
blood
in
short
at
each
of
these
occurrences
he
felt
what
was
infinitely
more
tormenting
than
the
stab
of
a
real
dagger
and
at
every
fresh
fillip
of
his
fear
he
acted
as
a
remembrancer
to
his
conductress
in
a
new
volley
of
imprecations
importing
that
her
life
was
absolutely
connected
with
his
opinion
of
his
own
safety
human
nature
could
not
longer
subsist
under
such
complicated
terror
at
last
he
found
himself
clear
of
the
forest
and
was
blessed
with
the
distant
view
of
an
inhabited
place
he
then
began
to
exercise
his
thoughts
upon
a
new
subject
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
make
a
parade
of
his
intrepidity
and
public
spirit
by
disclosing
his
achievement
and
surrendering
his
guide
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
or
leave
the
old
hag
and
her
accomplices
to
the
remorse
of
their
own
consciences
and
proceed
quietly
on
his
journey
to
paris
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
prize
he
had
already
obtained
this
last
step
he
determined
to
take
upon
recollecting
that
in
the
course
of
his
information
the
story
of
the
murdered
stranger
would
infallibly
attract
the
attention
of
justice
and
in
that
case
the
effects
he
had
borrowed
from
the
defunct
must
be
refunded
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
had
a
right
to
the
succession
this
was
an
argument
which
our
adventurer
could
not
resist
he
foresaw
that
he
should
be
stripped
of
his
acquisition
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
fair
fruits
of
his
valour
and
sagacity
and
moreover
be
detained
as
an
evidence
against
the
robbers
to
the
manifest
detriment
of
his
affairs
perhaps
too
he
had
motives
of
conscience
that
dissuaded
him
from
bearing
witness
against
a
set
of
people
whose
principles
did
not
much
differ
from
his
own
influenced
by
such
considerations
he
yielded
to
the
first
importunity
of
the
beldame
whom
he
dismissed
at
a
very
small
distance
from
the
village
after
he
had
earnestly
exhorted
her
to
quit
such
an
atrocious
course
of
life
and
atone
for
her
past
crimes
by
sacrificing
her
associates
to
the
demands
of
justice
she
did
not
fail
to
vow
a
perfect
reformation
and
to
prostrate
herself
before
him
for
the
favour
she
had
found
then
she
betook
herself
to
her
habitation
with
full
purpose
of
advising
her
to
repair
with
all
despatch
to
the
village
and
impeach
our
hero
who
wisely
distrusting
her
professions
stayed
no
longer
in
the
place
than
to
hire
a
guide
for
the
next
stage
which
brought
him
to
the
city
of
chapter
he
arrives
at
paris
and
is
pleased
with
his
reception
he
was
not
so
smitten
with
the
delightful
situation
of
this
ancient
town
but
that
he
abandoned
it
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
a
in
which
he
arrived
at
paris
without
having
been
exposed
to
any
other
troublesome
adventure
upon
the
road
he
took
lodgings
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
fauxbourg
de
germain
which
is
the
general
rendezvous
of
all
the
strangers
that
resort
to
this
capital
and
now
sincerely
congratulated
himself
upon
his
happy
escape
from
his
hungarian
connexions
and
from
the
snares
of
the
banditti
as
well
as
upon
the
spoils
of
the
dead
body
and
his
arrival
at
paris
from
whence
there
was
such
a
short
conveyance
to
england
whither
he
was
attracted
by
far
other
motives
than
that
of
filial
veneration
for
his
native
soil
he
suppressed
all
his
letters
of
recommendation
which
he
justly
concluded
would
subject
him
to
a
tedious
course
of
attendance
upon
the
great
and
lay
him
under
the
necessity
of
soliciting
preferment
in
the
army
than
which
nothing
was
farther
from
his
inclination
and
resolved
to
make
his
appearance
in
the
character
of
a
private
gentleman
which
would
supply
him
with
opportunities
of
examining
the
different
scenes
of
life
in
such
a
gay
metropolis
so
as
that
he
should
be
able
to
choose
that
sphere
in
which
he
could
move
the
most
effectually
to
his
own
advantage
he
accordingly
hired
an
occasional
domestic
and
under
the
denomination
of
count
fathom
which
he
had
retained
since
his
elopement
from
renaldo
repaired
to
dinner
at
an
ordinary
to
which
he
was
directed
as
a
reputable
place
frequented
by
fashionable
strangers
of
all
nations
he
found
this
piece
of
information
perfectly
just
for
he
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
than
his
ears
were
saluted
with
a
strange
confusion
of
sounds
among
which
he
at
once
distinguished
the
high
and
low
dutch
barbarous
french
italian
and
english
languages
he
was
rejoiced
at
this
occasion
of
displaying
his
own
qualifications
took
his
place
at
one
of
the
three
long
tables
betwixt
a
westphalian
count
and
a
bolognian
marquis
insinuated
himself
into
the
conversation
with
his
usual
address
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
found
means
to
accost
a
native
of
each
different
country
in
his
own
such
extensive
knowledge
did
not
pass
unobserved
a
french
abbe
in
a
provincial
dialect
complimented
him
upon
his
retaining
that
purity
in
pronunciation
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
speech
of
a
parisian
the
bolognian
mistaking
him
for
a
tuscan
sir
said
he
i
presume
you
are
from
florence
i
hope
the
illustrious
house
of
lorrain
leaves
you
gentlemen
of
that
famous
city
no
room
to
regret
the
loss
of
your
own
the
castle
of
versailles
becoming
the
subject
of
conversation
monsieur
le
compte
appealed
to
him
as
to
a
native
german
whether
it
was
not
inferior
in
point
of
magnificence
to
the
chateau
of
grubenhagen
the
dutch
officer
addressing
himself
to
fathom
drank
to
the
prosperity
of
faderland
and
asked
if
he
had
not
once
served
in
garrison
at
shenkenschans
and
an
english
knight
swore
with
great
assurance
that
he
had
frequently
rambled
with
him
at
midnight
among
the
hundreds
of
drury
to
each
person
he
replied
in
a
polite
though
mysterious
manner
which
did
not
fail
to
enhance
their
opinion
of
his
good
breeding
and
importance
and
long
before
the
dessert
appeared
he
was
by
all
the
company
supposed
to
be
a
personage
of
great
consequence
who
for
some
substantial
reasons
found
it
convenient
to
keep
himself
incognito
this
being
the
case
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
particular
civilities
were
poured
upon
him
from
all
quarters
he
perceived
their
sentiments
and
encouraged
them
by
behaving
with
that
sort
of
complaisance
which
seems
to
be
the
result
of
engaging
condescension
in
a
character
of
superior
dignity
and
station
his
affability
was
general
but
his
chief
attention
limited
to
those
gentlemen
already
mentioned
who
chanced
to
sit
nearest
him
at
table
and
he
no
sooner
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
an
utter
stranger
in
paris
than
they
unanimously
begged
to
have
the
honour
of
making
him
acquainted
with
the
different
curiosities
peculiar
to
that
metropolis
he
accepted
of
their
hospitality
accompanied
them
to
a
in
the
afternoon
from
whence
they
repaired
to
the
opera
and
afterwards
adjourned
to
a
noted
hotel
in
order
to
spend
the
remaining
part
of
the
evening
it
was
here
that
our
hero
secured
himself
effectually
in
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
their
good
graces
he
in
a
moment
saw
through
all
the
characters
of
the
party
and
adapted
himself
to
the
humour
of
each
individual
without
descending
from
that
elevation
of
behaviour
which
he
perceived
would
operate
among
them
in
his
behalf
with
the
italian
he
discoursed
on
music
in
the
style
of
a
connoisseur
and
indeed
had
a
better
claim
to
that
title
than
the
generality
of
those
upon
whom
it
is
usually
conferred
for
he
understood
the
art
in
theory
as
well
as
in
practice
and
would
have
made
no
contemptible
figure
among
the
best
performers
of
the
age
he
harangued
upon
taste
and
genius
to
the
abbe
who
was
a
wit
and
critic
ex
officio
or
rather
ex
vestitu
for
a
young
pert
frenchman
the
very
moment
he
puts
on
the
petit
collet
or
little
band
looks
upon
himself
as
an
inspired
son
of
apollo
and
every
one
of
the
fraternity
thinks
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
assert
the
divinity
of
his
mission
in
a
word
the
abbes
are
a
set
of
people
that
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
templars
in
london
fools
of
each
fabric
sharpers
of
all
sorts
and
dunces
of
every
degree
profess
themselves
of
both
orders
the
templar
is
generally
speaking
a
prig
so
is
the
abbe
both
are
distinguished
by
an
air
of
petulance
and
which
holds
a
middle
rank
betwixt
the
insolence
of
a
buck
and
the
learned
pride
of
a
supercilious
pedant
the
abbe
is
supposed
to
be
a
younger
brother
in
quest
of
preferment
in
the
church
the
temple
is
considered
as
a
receptacle
or
seminary
for
younger
sons
intended
for
the
bar
but
a
great
number
of
each
profession
turn
aside
into
other
paths
of
life
long
before
they
reach
these
proposed
goals
an
abbe
is
often
metamorphosed
into
a
foot
soldier
a
templar
sometimes
sinks
into
an
attorney
clerk
the
galleys
of
france
abound
with
abbes
and
many
templars
may
be
found
in
our
american
plantations
not
to
mention
those
who
have
made
a
public
exit
nearer
home
yet
i
would
not
have
it
thought
that
my
description
includes
every
individual
of
those
societies
some
of
the
greatest
scholars
politicians
and
wits
that
ever
europe
produced
have
worn
the
habit
of
an
abbe
and
many
of
our
most
noble
families
in
england
derive
their
honours
from
those
who
have
studied
law
in
the
temple
the
worthy
sons
of
every
community
shall
always
be
sacred
from
my
censure
and
ridicule
and
while
i
laugh
at
the
folly
of
particular
members
i
can
still
honour
and
revere
the
institution
but
let
us
return
from
this
comparison
which
some
readers
may
think
impertinent
and
unseasonable
and
observe
that
the
westphalian
count
dutch
officer
and
english
knight
were
not
excepted
from
the
particular
regard
and
attention
of
our
adventurer
he
pledged
the
german
in
every
bumper
flattered
the
hollander
with
compliments
upon
the
industry
wealth
and
policy
of
the
seven
united
provinces
but
he
reserved
his
chief
battery
for
his
own
countryman
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
in
all
respects
the
best
adapted
for
the
purposes
of
a
needy
gamester
him
therefore
he
cultivated
with
extraordinary
care
and
singular
observance
for
he
soon
perceived
him
to
be
a
humourist
and
from
that
circumstance
derived
an
happy
presage
of
his
own
success
the
disposition
seemed
to
be
cast
in
the
true
english
mould
he
was
sour
silent
and
contemptuous
his
very
looks
indicated
a
consciousness
of
superior
wealth
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
except
to
make
some
dry
sarcastic
national
reflection
nor
was
his
behaviour
free
from
that
air
of
suspicion
which
a
man
puts
on
when
he
believes
himself
in
a
crowd
of
whom
his
caution
and
vigilance
set
at
defiance
in
a
word
though
his
tongue
was
silent
on
the
subject
his
whole
demeanour
was
continually
saying
you
are
all
a
pack
of
poor
lousy
rascals
who
have
a
design
upon
my
purse
is
true
i
could
buy
your
whole
generation
but
i
wo
be
bubbled
d
see
i
am
aware
of
your
flattery
and
upon
my
guard
against
all
your
knavish
pranks
and
i
come
into
your
company
for
my
own
amusement
fathom
having
reconnoitred
this
peculiarity
of
temper
instead
of
treating
him
with
that
assiduous
complaisance
which
he
received
from
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
party
kept
aloof
from
him
in
the
conversation
with
a
remarkable
shyness
of
distant
civility
and
seldom
took
notice
of
what
he
said
except
with
a
view
to
contradict
him
or
retort
some
of
his
satirical
observations
this
he
conceived
to
be
the
best
method
of
acquiring
his
good
opinion
because
the
englishman
would
naturally
conclude
he
was
a
person
who
could
have
no
sinister
views
upon
his
fortune
else
he
would
have
chosen
quite
a
different
manner
of
deportment
accordingly
the
knight
seemed
to
bite
at
the
hook
he
listened
to
ferdinand
with
uncommon
regard
he
was
even
heard
to
commend
his
remarks
and
at
length
drank
to
their
better
acquaintance
chapter
acquits
himself
with
address
in
a
nocturnal
riot
the
italian
and
the
abbe
were
the
first
who
began
to
grow
whimsical
under
the
influence
of
the
burgundy
and
in
the
heat
of
their
elevation
proposed
that
the
company
should
amuse
themselves
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
night
at
the
house
of
an
obliging
dame
who
maintained
a
troop
of
fair
nymphs
for
the
accommodation
of
the
other
sex
the
proposal
was
approved
by
all
except
the
hollander
whose
economy
the
wine
had
not
as
yet
invaded
and
while
he
retreated
soberly
to
his
own
lodgings
the
rest
of
the
society
adjourned
in
two
coaches
to
the
temple
of
love
where
they
were
received
by
the
venerable
priestess
a
personage
turned
of
seventy
who
seemed
to
exercise
the
functions
of
her
calling
in
despite
of
the
most
cruel
ravages
of
time
for
age
had
bent
her
into
the
form
of
a
turkish
bow
her
head
was
agitated
by
the
palsy
like
the
leaf
of
the
poplar
tree
her
hair
fell
down
in
scanty
parcels
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
her
face
was
not
simply
wrinkled
but
ploughed
into
innumerable
furrows
her
jaws
could
not
boast
of
one
remaining
tooth
one
eye
distilled
a
large
quantity
of
rheum
by
virtue
of
the
fiery
edge
that
surrounded
it
the
other
was
altogether
extinguished
and
she
had
lost
her
nose
in
the
course
of
her
ministration
the
delphic
sibyl
was
but
a
type
of
this
hoary
matron
who
by
her
figure
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
consort
of
chaos
or
mother
of
time
yet
there
was
something
meritorious
in
her
appearance
as
it
denoted
her
an
indefatigable
minister
to
the
pleasure
of
mankind
and
as
it
formed
an
agreeable
contrast
with
the
beauty
and
youth
of
the
fair
damsels
that
wantoned
in
her
train
it
resembled
those
discords
in
music
which
properly
disposed
contribute
to
the
harmony
of
the
whole
piece
or
those
horrible
giants
who
in
the
world
of
romance
used
to
guard
the
gates
of
the
castle
in
which
the
enchanted
damsel
was
confined
this
urganda
seemed
to
be
aware
of
her
own
importance
and
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
human
appetite
for
she
compelled
the
whole
company
to
undergo
her
embrace
then
a
lacquey
in
magnificent
livery
ushered
them
into
a
superb
apartment
where
they
waited
some
minutes
without
being
favoured
with
the
appearance
of
the
ladies
to
the
manifest
dissatisfaction
of
the
abbe
who
sending
for
the
gouvernante
reprimanded
her
severely
for
her
want
of
politesse
the
old
lady
who
was
by
no
means
a
pattern
of
patience
and
submission
retorted
his
reproaches
with
great
emphasis
and
vivacity
her
eloquence
flowed
altogether
in
the
covent
garden
strain
and
i
question
whether
the
celebrated
mother
douglas
herself
could
have
made
such
a
figure
in
an
extemporaneous
altercation
after
having
bestowed
upon
the
abbe
the
epithets
of
saucy
insignificant
pimp
she
put
him
in
mind
of
the
good
offices
which
he
had
received
at
her
hands
how
she
had
supplied
him
with
bed
board
and
bedfellow
in
his
greatest
necessity
sent
him
abroad
with
money
in
his
pockets
and
in
a
word
cherished
him
in
her
bosom
when
his
own
mother
had
abandoned
him
to
distress
she
then
reviled
him
for
presuming
to
affront
her
before
strangers
and
gave
the
company
to
understand
that
the
young
ladies
would
wait
upon
them
as
soon
as
they
could
be
confessed
and
receive
absolution
from
a
worthy
cordelier
who
was
now
employed
in
performing
that
charitable
office
the
gentlemen
were
satisfied
with
this
remonstrance
which
argued
the
old
lady
pious
concern
for
the
souls
that
were
under
her
care
and
our
adventurer
proposed
an
accommodation
betwixt
her
and
the
abbe
who
was
prevailed
upon
to
ask
her
pardon
and
received
her
blessing
upon
his
knees
this
affair
had
not
been
long
adjusted
when
five
damsels
were
introduced
in
a
very
gay
dishabille
and
our
hero
was
complimented
with
the
privilege
of
choosing
his
amanda
from
the
whole
bevy
when
he
was
provided
the
others
began
to
pair
themselves
and
unhappily
the
german
count
chanced
to
pitch
upon
the
same
nymph
who
had
captivated
the
desires
of
the
british
knight
a
dispute
immediately
ensued
for
the
englishman
made
his
addresses
to
the
lady
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
priority
of
the
other
claim
and
she
being
pleased
with
his
attachment
did
not
scruple
to
renounce
his
rival
who
swore
by
the
thunder
lightning
and
sacrament
that
he
would
not
quit
his
pretensions
for
any
prince
in
christendom
much
less
for
a
little
english
cavalier
whom
he
had
already
honoured
too
much
in
condescending
to
be
his
companion
the
knight
provoked
at
this
stately
declaration
which
was
the
immediate
effect
of
anger
and
ebriety
eyed
his
antagonist
with
a
most
contemptuous
aspect
and
advised
him
to
avoid
such
comparisons
for
the
future
we
all
know
said
he
the
importance
of
a
german
count
i
suppose
your
revenue
amounts
to
three
hundred
and
you
have
a
chateau
that
looks
like
the
ruins
of
an
english
gaol
i
will
bind
myself
to
lend
you
a
thousand
pounds
upon
a
mortgage
of
your
estate
and
a
bad
bargain
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
if
i
do
not
in
less
than
two
months
find
a
yeoman
of
kent
who
spends
more
in
strong
ale
than
the
of
your
yearly
income
and
were
the
truth
known
i
believe
that
lace
upon
your
coat
is
no
better
than
tinsel
and
those
fringed
ruffles
with
fine
holland
sleeves
tacked
to
a
shirt
of
brown
canvas
so
that
were
you
to
undress
yourself
before
the
lady
you
would
only
expose
your
own
poverty
and
the
count
was
so
much
enraged
at
these
sarcastic
observations
that
his
faculty
of
speech
was
overwhelmed
by
his
resentment
though
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
englishman
imputation
he
forthwith
pulled
off
his
clothes
with
such
fury
that
his
brocade
waistcoat
was
tore
from
top
to
bottom
the
knight
mistaking
his
meaning
considered
this
demeanour
as
a
fair
challenge
to
try
which
was
the
better
man
in
the
exercise
of
boxing
and
on
that
supposition
began
to
strip
in
his
turn
when
he
was
undeceived
by
fathom
who
put
the
right
interpretation
upon
the
behaviour
and
begged
that
the
affair
might
be
compromised
by
this
time
the
westphalian
recovered
the
use
of
his
tongue
and
with
many
threats
and
imprecations
desired
they
would
take
notice
how
falsely
he
had
been
aspersed
and
do
him
justice
in
espousing
his
claim
to
the
damsel
in
question
before
the
company
had
time
or
inclination
to
interest
themselves
in
the
quarrel
his
opponent
observed
that
no
person
who
was
not
a
mere
german
would
ever
dream
of
forcing
the
inclinations
of
a
pretty
girl
whom
the
accidents
of
fortune
had
subjected
to
his
power
that
such
compulsion
was
equivalent
to
the
most
cruel
rape
that
could
be
committed
and
that
the
lady
aversion
was
not
at
all
surprising
for
to
speak
his
own
sentiments
were
he
a
woman
of
pleasure
he
would
as
soon
grant
favours
to
a
westphalian
hog
as
to
the
person
of
his
antagonist
the
german
enraged
at
this
comparison
was
quite
abandoned
by
his
patience
and
discretion
he
called
the
knight
an
english
clown
and
swearing
he
was
the
most
untoward
beast
of
a
whole
nation
of
mules
snatched
up
one
of
the
candlesticks
which
he
launched
at
him
with
such
force
and
violence
that
it
sung
through
the
air
and
winging
its
flight
into
the
encountered
the
skull
of
his
own
valet
who
with
immediate
prostration
received
the
message
of
his
master
the
knight
that
he
might
not
be
behindhand
with
the
westphalian
in
point
of
courtesy
returned
the
compliment
with
the
remaining
chandelier
which
also
missed
its
mark
and
smiting
a
large
mirror
that
was
fixed
behind
them
emitted
such
a
crash
as
one
might
expect
to
hear
if
a
mine
were
sprung
beneath
a
manufacture
of
glass
both
lights
being
thus
extinguished
a
furious
combat
ensued
in
the
dark
the
italian
scampered
off
with
infinite
agility
and
as
he
went
downstairs
desired
that
nobody
would
interpose
because
it
was
an
affair
of
honour
which
could
not
be
made
up
the
ladies
consulted
their
safety
in
flight
count
fathom
slyly
retired
to
one
corner
of
the
room
while
the
abbe
having
upon
him
the
terrors
of
the
commissaire
endeavoured
to
appease
and
part
the
combatants
and
in
the
attempt
sustained
a
random
blow
upon
his
nose
which
sent
him
howling
into
the
other
chamber
where
finding
his
band
besmeared
with
his
own
blood
he
began
to
caper
about
the
apartment
in
a
transport
of
rage
and
vexation
meanwhile
the
old
gentlewoman
being
alarmed
with
the
noise
of
the
battle
and
apprehensive
that
it
would
end
in
murder
to
the
danger
and
discredit
of
herself
and
family
immediately
mustered
up
her
myrmidons
of
whom
she
always
retained
a
formidable
band
and
putting
herself
at
their
head
lighted
them
to
the
scene
of
uproar
ferdinand
who
had
hitherto
observed
a
strict
neutrality
no
sooner
perceived
them
approach
than
he
leaped
in
between
the
disputants
that
he
might
be
found
acting
in
the
character
of
a
peacemaker
and
indeed
by
this
time
victory
had
declared
for
the
baronet
who
had
treated
his
antagonist
with
a
which
laid
him
almost
breathless
on
the
floor
the
victor
was
prevailed
upon
by
the
entreaties
of
fathom
to
quit
the
field
of
battle
and
adjourn
into
another
room
where
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
received
a
billet
from
the
count
defying
him
to
single
combat
on
the
frontiers
of
flanders
at
an
appointed
time
and
place
the
challenge
was
immediately
accepted
by
the
knight
who
being
flushed
with
conquest
treated
his
adversary
with
great
contempt
but
next
day
when
the
fumes
of
the
burgundy
were
quite
exhaled
and
the
adventure
recurred
to
his
remembrance
and
sober
reflection
he
waited
upon
our
adventurer
at
his
lodgings
and
solicited
his
advice
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
looked
upon
what
had
happened
as
a
drunken
brawl
which
ought
to
have
no
serious
consequences
fathom
foreseeing
that
the
affair
might
be
managed
for
his
own
interest
professed
himself
of
the
baronet
opinion
and
without
hesitation
undertook
the
office
of
a
mediator
assuring
his
principal
that
his
honour
should
suffer
no
stain
in
the
course
of
his
negotiation
having
received
the
englishman
acknowledgments
for
this
instance
of
friendship
he
forthwith
set
out
for
the
place
of
the
habitation
and
understanding
he
was
still
asleep
insisted
upon
his
being
immediately
waked
and
told
that
a
gentleman
from
the
chevalier
desired
to
see
him
upon
business
of
importance
which
could
not
be
delayed
accordingly
his
pressed
by
importunities
and
remonstrances
ventured
to
go
in
and
shake
the
count
by
the
shoulder
when
this
furious
teutonian
still
agitated
by
the
fever
of
the
preceding
night
leaped
out
of
bed
in
a
frenzy
and
seizing
his
sword
that
lay
upon
a
table
would
have
severely
punished
the
presumption
of
his
servant
had
not
he
been
restrained
by
the
entrance
of
ferdinand
who
with
a
peremptory
countenance
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
valet
had
acted
at
his
immediate
instigation
and
that
he
was
come
as
the
englishman
friend
to
concert
with
him
proper
measures
for
keeping
the
appointment
they
had
made
at
their
last
meeting
this
message
effectually
calmed
the
german
who
was
not
a
little
mortified
to
find
himself
so
disagreeably
disturbed
he
could
not
help
cursing
the
impatience
of
his
antagonist
and
even
hinting
that
he
would
have
acted
more
like
a
gentleman
and
good
christian
in
expressing
a
desire
of
seeing
the
affair
accommodated
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
the
aggressor
consequently
the
first
offender
against
the
laws
of
politeness
and
fathom
finding
him
in
a
fit
temper
of
mind
took
the
opportunity
of
assenting
to
the
reasonableness
of
his
observation
he
ventured
to
condemn
the
impetuosity
of
the
baronet
who
he
perceived
was
extremely
nice
and
scrupulous
in
the
punctilios
of
honour
and
said
it
was
a
pity
that
two
gentlemen
should
forfeit
each
other
friendship
much
less
expose
their
lives
for
such
a
frivolous
cause
my
dear
count
cried
the
westphalian
i
am
charmed
to
find
your
sentiments
so
conformable
to
my
own
in
an
honourable
cause
i
despise
all
danger
my
courage
thank
heaven
has
been
manifested
in
many
public
engagements
as
well
as
in
private
rencounters
but
to
break
with
my
friend
whose
eminent
virtues
i
admire
and
even
to
seek
his
life
on
such
a
scandalous
occasion
for
a
little
insignificant
w
who
i
suppose
took
the
advantage
of
our
intoxication
to
foment
the
quarrel
by
heaven
my
conscience
can
not
digest
having
expressed
himself
to
this
purpose
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
reply
of
ferdinand
who
after
a
pause
of
deliberation
offered
his
services
in
the
way
of
mediation
though
he
observed
it
was
a
matter
of
great
delicacy
and
the
event
altogether
uncertain
nevertheless
added
our
adventurer
i
will
strive
to
appease
the
knight
who
i
hope
will
be
induced
by
my
remonstrances
to
forget
the
unlucky
accident
which
hath
so
disagreeably
interrupted
your
mutual
the
german
thanked
him
for
this
proof
of
his
regard
which
yielded
him
more
satisfaction
on
account
of
the
chevalier
than
of
himself
for
by
the
tombs
of
my
fathers
cried
he
i
have
so
little
concern
for
my
personal
safety
that
if
my
honour
were
interested
i
durst
oppose
myself
singly
to
the
whole
ban
of
the
empire
and
i
am
now
ready
if
the
chevalier
requires
it
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
in
the
forest
of
senlis
either
on
horseback
or
on
foot
where
this
contest
may
be
terminated
with
the
life
of
one
or
both
of
count
fathom
with
a
view
to
chastise
the
westphalian
for
this
rhodomontade
told
him
with
a
mortifying
air
of
indifference
that
if
they
were
both
bent
upon
taking
the
field
he
would
save
himself
the
trouble
of
interposing
farther
in
the
affair
and
desired
to
know
the
hour
at
which
it
would
suit
him
to
take
the
air
with
the
baronet
the
other
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
this
question
said
with
a
faltering
tongue
he
should
be
proud
to
obey
the
chevalier
orders
but
at
the
same
time
owned
he
should
be
much
better
pleased
if
our
hero
would
execute
the
pacific
proposal
he
had
made
fathom
accordingly
promised
to
exert
himself
for
that
purpose
and
returned
to
the
knight
with
whom
he
assumed
the
merit
of
having
tranquillised
the
rage
of
an
incensed
barbarian
who
was
now
disposed
to
a
reconciliation
upon
equal
terms
the
baronet
overwhelmed
him
with
caresses
and
compliments
upon
his
friendship
and
address
the
parties
met
that
same
forenoon
as
if
by
accident
in
fathom
apartment
where
they
embraced
each
other
cordially
exchanged
apologies
and
renewed
their
former
correspondence
our
adventurer
thought
he
had
good
reason
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
part
he
had
acted
in
this
pacification
he
was
treated
by
both
with
signal
marks
of
particular
affection
and
esteem
the
count
pressed
him
to
accept
as
a
token
of
his
attachment
a
sword
of
very
curious
workmanship
which
he
had
received
in
a
present
from
a
certain
prince
of
the
empire
the
knight
forced
upon
his
finger
a
very
splendid
diamond
ring
as
a
testimony
of
his
gratitude
and
esteem
but
there
was
still
another
person
to
be
appeased
before
the
peace
of
the
whole
company
could
be
established
this
was
no
other
than
the
abbe
from
whom
each
of
the
reconciled
friends
received
at
dinner
a
billet
couched
in
these
words
i
have
the
honour
to
lament
the
infinite
chagrin
and
mortification
that
compels
me
to
address
myself
in
this
manner
to
a
person
of
your
rank
and
eminence
whom
i
should
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
in
person
were
i
not
prevented
by
the
misfortune
of
my
nose
which
was
last
night
most
cruelly
disarranged
by
a
violent
contusion
i
had
the
honour
to
receive
in
attempting
to
compose
that
unhappy
fracas
at
the
house
of
madame
la
maquerelle
and
what
puts
the
finishing
stroke
to
my
mishap
is
my
being
rendered
incapable
of
keeping
three
or
four
assignations
with
ladies
of
fashion
by
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
be
particularly
esteemed
the
disfiguration
of
my
nose
the
pain
i
have
undergone
with
the
discomposure
of
brain
which
it
produced
i
could
bear
as
a
philosopher
but
the
disappointment
of
the
ladies
my
glory
will
not
permit
me
to
overlook
and
as
you
know
the
injury
was
sustained
in
your
service
i
have
the
pleasure
to
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
grant
such
reparation
as
will
be
acceptable
to
a
gentleman
who
has
the
honour
to
be
with
inviolable
attachment
sir
your
most
devoted
slave
pepin
clothaire
charle
henri
loouis
barnabe
de
this
epistle
was
so
equivocal
that
the
persons
to
whom
it
was
addressed
did
not
know
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
interpret
the
contents
into
a
challenge
when
our
hero
observed
that
the
ambiguity
of
his
expressions
plainly
proved
there
was
a
door
left
open
for
accommodation
and
proposed
that
they
should
forthwith
visit
the
writer
at
his
own
apartment
they
accordingly
followed
his
advice
and
found
the
abbe
in
his
morning
gown
and
slippers
with
three
huge
nightcaps
on
his
head
and
a
crape
tied
over
the
middle
of
his
face
by
way
of
bandage
to
his
nose
he
received
his
visitors
with
the
most
ridiculous
solemnity
being
still
a
stranger
to
the
purport
of
their
errand
but
soon
as
the
westphalian
declared
they
were
come
in
consequence
of
his
billet
in
order
to
ask
pardon
for
the
undesigned
offence
they
had
given
his
features
retrieved
their
natural
vivacity
and
he
professed
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
polite
acknowledgment
then
they
condoled
him
upon
the
evil
plight
of
his
nose
and
seeing
some
marks
upon
his
shirt
asked
with
seeming
concern
if
he
had
lost
any
blood
in
the
fray
to
this
interrogation
he
replied
that
he
had
still
a
sufficient
quantity
left
for
the
occasions
of
his
friends
and
that
he
should
deem
it
his
greatest
glory
to
expend
the
last
drop
of
it
in
their
service
matters
being
thus
amicably
adjusted
they
prevailed
upon
him
to
unease
his
nose
which
retained
no
signs
of
the
outrage
he
had
suffered
and
the
amusements
of
the
day
were
concerted
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
plan
that
after
the
comedy
they
were
entertained
at
the
lodgings
where
quadrille
was
proposed
by
the
abbe
as
the
most
innocent
pastime
and
the
proposal
was
immediately
embraced
by
all
present
and
by
none
with
more
alacrity
than
by
our
adventurer
who
without
putting
forth
a
moiety
of
his
skill
went
home
with
twenty
louis
clear
gain
though
far
from
believing
himself
greatly
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
artifices
of
play
he
justly
suspected
that
they
had
concealed
their
skill
with
a
view
of
stripping
him
on
some
other
occasion
for
he
could
not
suppose
that
persons
of
their
figure
and
character
should
be
in
reality
such
novices
as
they
affected
to
appear
chapter
he
overlooks
the
advances
of
his
friends
and
smarts
severely
for
his
neglect
steeled
with
this
cautious
maxim
he
guarded
himself
from
their
united
endeavours
in
sundry
subsequent
attacks
by
which
his
first
conjecture
was
confirmed
and
still
came
off
conqueror
by
virtue
of
his
unparalleled
finesse
and
discretion
till
at
length
they
seemed
to
despair
of
making
him
their
prey
and
the
count
began
to
drop
some
hints
importing
a
desire
of
seeing
him
more
closely
united
to
the
views
and
interest
of
their
triumvirate
but
ferdinand
who
was
altogether
selfish
and
quite
solitary
in
his
prospects
discouraged
all
those
advances
being
resolved
to
trade
upon
his
own
bottom
only
and
to
avoid
all
such
connexions
with
any
person
or
society
whatever
much
more
with
a
set
of
raw
adventurers
whose
talents
he
despised
with
these
sentiments
he
still
maintained
the
dignity
and
reserve
of
his
first
appearance
among
them
and
rather
enhanced
than
diminished
that
idea
of
importance
which
he
had
inspired
at
the
beginning
because
besides
his
other
qualifications
they
gave
him
credit
for
the
address
with
which
he
kept
himself
superior
to
their
united
designs
while
he
thus
enjoyed
his
together
with
the
fruits
of
his
success
at
play
which
he
managed
so
discreetly
as
never
to
incur
the
reputation
of
an
adventurer
he
one
day
chanced
to
be
at
the
ordinary
when
the
company
was
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
such
a
figure
as
had
never
appeared
before
in
that
place
this
was
no
other
than
a
person
habited
in
the
exact
uniform
of
an
english
jockey
his
leathern
cap
cut
bob
fustian
frock
flannel
waistcoat
buff
breeches
and
whip
were
sufficient
of
themselves
to
furnish
out
a
phenomenon
for
the
admiration
of
all
paris
but
these
peculiarities
were
rendered
still
more
conspicuous
by
the
behaviour
of
the
man
who
owned
them
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
outward
door
he
produced
such
a
sound
from
the
smack
of
his
whip
as
equalled
the
explosion
of
an
ordinary
cohorn
and
then
broke
forth
into
the
halloo
of
a
foxhunter
which
he
uttered
with
all
its
variations
in
a
strain
of
vociferation
that
seemed
to
astonish
and
confound
the
whole
assembly
to
whom
he
introduced
himself
and
his
spaniel
by
exclaiming
in
a
tone
something
less
melodious
than
the
cry
of
mackerel
or
live
cod
by
your
leave
gentlevolks
i
hope
there
no
offence
in
an
honest
plain
englishman
coming
with
money
in
his
pocket
to
taste
a
bit
of
your
vrench
frigasee
and
this
declaration
was
made
in
such
a
wild
fantastical
manner
that
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
mistook
him
for
some
savage
monster
or
maniac
and
consulted
their
safety
by
starting
up
from
table
and
drawing
their
swords
the
englishman
seeing
such
a
martial
apparatus
produced
against
him
recoiled
two
or
three
steps
saying
waunds
a
believe
the
people
are
all
bewitched
what
do
they
take
me
for
a
beast
of
prey
is
there
nobody
here
that
knows
sir
stentor
stile
or
can
speak
to
me
in
my
own
lingo
he
had
no
sooner
pronounced
these
words
than
the
baronet
with
marks
of
infinite
surprise
ran
towards
him
crying
good
heaven
sir
stentor
who
expected
to
meet
with
you
in
paris
upon
which
the
other
eyeing
him
very
earnestly

cried
he
my
neighbour

as

a

soul
with
these
words
he
flew
upon
him
like
a
tiger
kissed
him
from
ear
to
ear
demolished
his
periwig
and
disordered
the
whole
economy
of
his
dress
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
company
having
stifled
his
countryman
with
embraces
and
besmeared
himself
with
pulville
from
head
to
foot
he
proceeded
in
this
manner
mercy
upon
thee
knight
thou
art
so
transmographied
and
bedaubed
and
bedizened
that
thou
mought

among
these
compliments
being
passed
the
two
knights
sat
down
by
one
another
and
sir
stentor
being
asked
by
his
neighbour
upon
what
errand
he
had
crossed
the
sea
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
come
to
france
in
consequence
of
a
wager
with
squire
snaffle
who
had
laid
a
thousand
pounds
that
he
sir
stentor
would
not
travel
to
paris
by
himself
and
for
a
whole
month
appear
every
day
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
public
walks
without
wearing
any
other
dress
than
that
in
which
he
saw
him
the
fellor
has
got
no
more
stuff
in
his
pate
continued
this
polite
stranger
than
a
jackass
to
think
i
could
not
find
my
way
hither
thof
i
could
not
jabber
your
french
lingo
ecod
the
people
of
this
country
are
sharp
enough
to
find
out
your
meaning
when
you
want
to
spend
anything
among
them
and
as
for
the
matter
of
dress
bodikins
for
a
thousand
pound
i
would
engage
to
live
in
the
midst
of
them
and
show
myself
without
any
clothes
at
all
odds
heart
a
englishman
needs
not
be
ashamed
to
show
his
face
nor
his
backside
neither
with
the
best
frenchman
that
ever
trod
the
ground
thof
we
englishmen
do
beplaister
our
doublets
with
gold
and
silver
i
believe
as
how
we
have
our
pockets
better
lined
than
most
of
our
neighbours
and
for
all
my
bit
of
a
fustian
frock
that
cost
me
in
all
but
forty
shillings
i
believe
between
you
and
me
knight
i
have
more
dust
in
my
fob
than
all
those
powdered
sparks
put
together
but
the
worst
of
the
matter
is
this
here
is
no
solid
in
this
country
one
ca
have
a
slice
of
delicate
sirloin
or
nice
buttock
of
beef
for
love
nor
money
a
pize
upon
them
i
could
get
no
eatables
upon
the
ruoad
but
what
they
called
bully
which
looks
like
the
flesh
of
pharaoh
lean
kine
stewed
into
rags
and
tatters
and
then

them
one
would
think
every
old
woman
of
this
kingdom
hatched
pigeons
from
her
own
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
such
an
original
sat
unobserved
the
french
and
other
foreigners
who
had
never
been
in
england
were
struck
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
knight
appearance
and
deportment
while
the
english
guests
were
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
confusion
and
kept
a
most
wary
silence
for
fear
of
being
recognised
by
their
countryman
as
for
our
adventurer
he
was
inwardly
transported
with
joy
at
sight
of
this
curiosity
he
considered
him
as
a
genuine
rich
country
booby
of
the
right
english
growth
fresh
as
imported
and
his
heart
throbbed
with
rapture
when
he
heard
sir
stentor
value
himself
upon
the
lining
of
his
pockets
he
foresaw
indeed
that
the
other
knight
would
endeavour
to
reserve
him
for
his
own
game
but
he
was
too
conscious
of
his
own
accomplishments
to
think
he
should
find
great
difficulty
in
superseding
the
influence
of
sir
giles
meanwhile
the
was
by
his
friend
helped
to
some
ragout
which
pleased
his
palate
so
well
that
he
declared
he
should
now
make
a
hearty
meal
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
crossed
the
water
and
while
his
prevailed
he
drank
to
every
individual
around
the
table
ferdinand
seized
this
opportunity
of
insinuating
himself
into
his
favour
by
saying
in
english
he
was
glad
to
find
there
was
anything
in
france
that
was
agreeable
to
sir
stentor
to
this
compliment
the
knight
replied
with
an
air
of
surprise
waunds
i
find
here
another
countryman
of
mine
in
this
here
company
sir
i
am
proud
to
see
you
with
all
my
so
speaking
he
thrust
out
his
right
hand
across
the
table
and
shook
our
hero
by
the
fist
with
such
violence
of
civility
as
proved
very
grievous
to
a
french
marquis
who
in
helping
himself
to
soup
was
jostled
in
such
a
manner
as
to
overturn
the
in
his
own
bosom
the
englishman
seeing
the
mischief
he
had
produced
cried
no
offence
i
hope
in
a
tone
of
vociferation
which
the
marquis
in
all
probability
misconstrued
for
he
began
to
model
his
features
into
a
very
sublime
and
peremptory
look
when
fathom
interpreted
the
apology
and
at
the
same
time
informed
sir
stentor
that
although
he
himself
had
not
the
honour
of
being
an
englishman
he
had
always
entertained
a
most
particular
veneration
for
the
country
and
learned
the
language
in
consequence
of
that
esteem
blood
answered
the
knight
i
think
myself
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
opinion
than
if
you
was
my
countryman
in
good
earnest
for
there
be
abundance
of
we
english
no
offence
sir
giles
that
seem
to
be
ashamed
of
their
own
nation
and
leave
their
homes
to
come
and
spend
their
fortunes
abroad
among
a
parcel
of
you
understand
me
sir
a
word
to
the
wise
as
the
saying
here
he
was
interrupted
by
an
article
of
the
second
course
that
seemed
to
give
him
great
disturbance
this
was
a
roasted
leveret
very
strong
of
the
fumet
which
happened
to
be
placed
directly
under
his
nose
his
sense
of
smelling
was
no
sooner
encountered
by
the
effluvia
of
this
delicious
fare
than
he
started
up
from
table
exclaiming
odd
my
liver
here
a
piece
of
carrion
that
i
would
not
offer
to
a
hound
in
my
kennel
is
enough
to
make
any
christian
vomit
both
gut
and
gall
and
indeed
by
the
wry
faces
he
made
while
he
ran
to
the
door
his
stomach
seemed
ready
to
justify
this
last
assertion
the
abbe
who
concluded
from
these
symptoms
of
disgust
that
the
leveret
was
not
sufficiently
stale
began
to
exhibit
marks
of
discontent
and
desired
that
it
might
be
brought
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
for
his
examination
he
accordingly
hung
over
it
with
the
most
greedy
appetite
feasting
his
nostrils
with
the
steams
of
animal
putrefaction
and
at
length
declared
that
the
morceau
was
passable
though
he
owned
it
would
have
been
highly
perfect
had
it
been
kept
another
week
nevertheless
mouths
were
not
wanting
to
discuss
it
insipid
as
it
was
for
in
three
minutes
there
was
not
a
vestige
to
be
seen
of
that
which
had
offended
the
organs
of
sir
stentor
who
now
resumed
his
place
and
did
justice
to
the
dessert
but
what
he
seemed
to
relish
better
than
any
other
part
of
the
entertainment
was
the
conversation
of
our
adventurer
whom
after
dinner
he
begged
to
have
the
honour
of
treating
with
a
dish
of
coffee
to
the
seeming
mortification
of
his
brother
knight
over
which
fathom
exulted
in
his
own
heart
in
short
our
hero
by
his
affability
and
engaging
deportment
immediately
gained
possession
of
sir
stentor
good
graces
insomuch
that
he
desired
to
crack
a
bottle
with
him
in
the
evening
and
they
repaired
to
an
auberge
whither
his
accompanied
him
not
without
manifest
signs
of
reluctance
there
the
stranger
gave
a
loose
to
jollity
though
at
first
he
d
the
burgundy
as
a
poor
thin
liquor
that
ran
through
him
in
a
twinkling
and
instead
of
warming
cooled
his
heart
and
bowels
however
it
insensibly
seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
his
imputation
for
his
spirits
rose
to
a
more
elevated
pitch
of
mirth
and
he
sung
or
rather
roared
the
early
horn
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
began
to
slabber
his
companions
with
a
most
affection
yet
whatever
haste
he
made
to
the
goal
of
ebriety
he
was
distanced
by
his
brother
baronet
who
from
the
beginning
of
the
party
had
made
little
other
use
of
his
mouth
than
to
receive
the
glass
and
now
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
in
a
state
of
temporary
annihilation
he
was
immediately
carried
to
bed
by
the
direction
of
ferdinand
who
now
saw
himself
in
a
manner
possessor
of
that
mine
to
which
he
had
made
such
eager
and
artful
advances
that
he
might
therefore
carry
on
the
approaches
in
the
same
cautious
manner
he
gradually
shook
off
the
trammels
of
sobriety
gave
a
loose
to
that
spirit
of
freedom
which
good
liquor
commonly
inspires
and
in
the
familiarity
of
drunkenness
owned
himself
head
of
a
noble
family
of
poland
from
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
absent
himself
on
account
of
an
affair
of
honour
not
yet
compromised
having
made
this
confession
and
laid
strong
injunctions
of
secrecy
upon
sir
stentor
his
countenance
seemed
to
acquire
from
every
succeeding
glass
a
new
symptom
of
intoxication
they
renewed
their
embraces
swore
eternal
friendship
from
that
day
and
swallowed
fresh
bumpers
till
both
being
in
all
appearance
quite
overpowered
they
began
to
yawn
in
concert
and
even
nod
in
their
chairs
the
knight
seemed
to
resent
the
attacks
of
slumber
as
so
many
impertinent
attempts
to
interrupt
their
entertainment
he
cursed
his
own
propensity
to
sleep
imputing
it
to
the
d
french
climate
and
proposed
to
engage
in
some
pastime
that
would
keep
them
awake
odd
flesh
cried
the
briton
when
i
at
home
i
defy
all
the
devils
in
hell
to
fasten
my
eyelids
together
if
so
be
as
i
otherwise
inclined

i

that

it
i
wo
turn
my
back
to

at
any
of
these
pastimes
and
so
count
if
you
are
so
disposed
i
am

in
the
way
of

at
which
of
these
you
shall
please
to
pitch
to
this
proposal
fathom
replied
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
the
games
he
had
mentioned
but
in
order
to
amuse
sir
stentor
he
would
play
with
him
at
lansquenet
for
a
trifle
as
he
had
laid
it
down
for
a
maxim
to
risk
nothing
considerable
at
play
waunds
answered
the
knight
i
hope
you
do
think
i
come
here
in
quest
of
money
thank
god
i
have
a
good
landed
estate
worth
five
thousand
a
year
and
owe
no

a
halfpenny
and
i
question
whether
there
be
many

in
your
nation
no
offence
i
hope
that
can
say
a
bolder
word
as
for
your

net
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
but
i
will
toss

for
a

the
saying
is

if
there
such
a
thing
in
this
country
as
a
box
and
dice

love
to
hear
the
bones
rattle
fathom
found
some
difficulty
in
concealing
his
joy
at
the
mention
of
this
last
amusement
which
had
been
one
of
his
chief
studies
and
in
which
he
had
made
such
progress
that
he
could
calculate
all
the
chances
with
the
utmost
exactness
and
certainty
however
he
made
shift
to
contain
himself
within
due
bounds
and
with
seeming
indifference
consented
to
pass
away
an
hour
at
hazard
provided
the
implements
could
be
procured
accordingly
the
landlord
was
consulted
and
their
desire
gratified
the
dice
were
produced
and
the
table
resounded
with
the
effects
of
their
mutual
eagerness
fortune
at
first
declared
for
the
englishman
who
was
permitted
by
our
adventurer
to
win
twenty
broad
pieces
and
he
was
so
elated
with
his
success
as
to
accompany
every
lucky
throw
with
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
and
other
savage
and
simple
manifestations
of
excessive
joy
exclaiming
in
a
tone
something
less
sweet
than
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
now
for
the
main
count
odd
here
they
come
here
are
the
seven
black
stars
come
along

yellow

heart
i
never
liked
the
face
of
lewis
fathom
drew
happy
presages
from
these
boyish
raptures
and
after
having
indulged
them
for
some
time
began
to
avail
himself
of
his
arithmetic
in
consequence
of
which
the
knight
was
obliged
to
refund
the
greatest
part
of
his
winning
then
he
altered
his
note
and
became
as
intemperate
in
his
chagrin
as
he
had
been
before
immoderate
in
his
mirth
he
cursed
himself
and
his
whole
generation
d
his
bad
luck
stamped
with
his
feet
upon
the
floor
and
challenged
ferdinand
to
double
stakes
this
was
a
very
welcome
proposal
to
our
hero
who
found
sir
stentor
just
such
a
subject
as
he
had
long
desired
to
encounter
with
the
more
the
englishman
laid
the
more
he
lost
and
fathom
took
care
to
inflame
his
passions
by
certain
sarcasms
upon
his
want
of
judgment
till
at
length
he
became
quite
outrageous
swore
the
dice
were
false
and
threw
them
out
at
the
window
pulled
off
his
periwig
and
committed
it
to
the
flames
spoke
with
the
most
rancorous
contempt
of
his
adversary
skill
insisted
upon
his
having
stripped
many
a
better
man
for
all
he
was
a
count
and
threatening
that
before
they
parted
he
should
not
only
look
like
a
pole
but
also
smell
like
a
this
was
a
spirit
which
our
adventurer
industriously
kept
up
observing
that
the
english
were
dupes
to
all
the
world
and
that
in
point
of
genius
and
address
they
were
no
more
than
noisy
braggadocios
in
short
another
pair
of
dice
was
procured
the
stakes
were
again
raised
and
after
several
vicissitudes
fortune
declared
so
much
in
favour
of
the
knight
that
fathom
lost
all
the
money
in
his
pocket
amounting
to
a
pretty
considerable
sum
by
this
time
he
was
warmed
into
uncommon
eagerness
and
impatience
being
equally
piqued
at
the
success
and
provoking
exultations
of
his
antagonist
whom
he
now
invited
to
his
lodgings
in
order
to
decide
the
contest
sir
stentor
complied
with
this
request
the
dispute
was
renewed
with
various
success
till
towards
daylight
ferdinand
saw
this
noisy
raw
inexperienced
simpleton
carry
off
all
his
ready
cash
together
with
his
jewels
and
almost
everything
that
was
valuable
about
his
person
and
to
crown
the
whole
the
victor
at
parting
told
him
with
a
most
intolerable
sneer
that
as
soon
as
the
count
should
receive
another
remittance
from
poland
he
would
give
him
his
revenge
chapter
he
bears
his
fate
like
a
philosopher
and
contracts
acquaintance
with
a
very
remarkable
personage
this
was
a
proper
subject
for
our
hero
to
moralise
upon
and
accordingly
it
did
not
pass
without
his
remarks
he
found
himself
fairly
foiled
at
his
own
weapons
reduced
to
indigence
in
a
foreign
land
and
what
he
chiefly
regretted
robbed
of
all
those
gay
expectations
he
had
indulged
from
his
own
supposed
excellence
in
the
wiles
of
fraud
for
upon
a
little
recollection
he
plainly
perceived
he
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
confederacy
he
had
refused
to
join
and
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
the
dice
were
loaded
for
his
destruction
but
instead
of
beating
his
head
against
the
wall
tearing
his
hair
imprecating
vain
curses
upon
himself
or
betraying
other
frantic
symptoms
of
despair
he
resolved
to
accommodate
himself
to
his
fate
and
profit
by
the
lesson
he
had
so
dearly
bought
with
this
intention
he
immediately
dismissed
his
valet
quitted
his
lodgings
retired
to
an
obscure
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
covering
one
eye
with
a
large
patch
of
black
silk
presented
himself
in
quality
of
a
musician
to
the
director
of
the
opera
who
upon
hearing
a
trial
of
his
skill
received
him
into
the
band
without
further
question
while
he
continued
in
this
situation
he
not
only
improved
his
taste
and
execution
in
music
but
likewise
found
frequent
opportunities
to
extend
his
knowledge
of
mankind
for
besides
the
employment
he
exercised
in
public
he
was
often
concerned
in
private
concerts
that
were
given
in
the
hotels
of
noblemen
by
which
means
he
became
more
and
more
acquainted
with
the
persons
manners
and
characters
of
high
life
which
he
contemplated
with
the
most
industrious
attention
as
a
spectator
who
being
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
performance
is
at
more
liberty
to
observe
and
enjoy
the
particulars
of
the
entertainment
it
was
in
one
of
those
assemblies
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
friend
sir
stentor
dressed
in
the
most
fashionable
manner
and
behaving
with
all
the
overstrained
politesse
of
a
native
frenchman
he
was
accompanied
by
his
brother
knight
and
the
abbe
and
this
triumvirate
even
in
fathom
hearing
gave
a
most
ludicrous
detail
of
the
finesse
they
had
practised
upon
the
polish
count
to
their
entertainer
who
was
ambassador
from
a
certain
court
and
made
himself
extremely
merry
with
the
particulars
of
the
relation
indeed
they
made
shift
to
describe
some
of
the
circumstances
in
such
a
ridiculous
light
that
our
adventurer
himself
smarting
as
he
was
with
the
disgrace
could
not
help
laughing
in
secret
at
the
account
he
afterwards
made
it
his
business
to
inquire
into
the
characters
of
the
two
british
knights
and
understood
they
were
notorious
sharpers
who
had
come
abroad
for
the
good
of
their
country
and
now
hunted
in
couple
among
a
french
pack
that
dispersed
themselves
through
the
public
ordinaries
walks
and
spectacles
in
order
to
make
a
prey
of
incautious
strangers
the
pride
of
ferdinand
was
piqued
at
this
information
and
he
was
even
animated
with
the
desire
of
making
reprisals
upon
this
fraternity
from
which
he
ardently
longed
to
retrieve
his
honour
and
effects
but
the
issue
of
his
last
adventure
had
reinforced
his
caution
and
for
the
present
he
found
means
to
suppress
the
dictates
of
his
avarice
and
ambition
resolving
to
employ
his
whole
penetration
in
reconnoitring
the
ground
before
he
should
venture
to
take
the
field
again
he
therefore
continued
to
act
the
part
of
a
fiddler
under
the
name
of
fadini
and
lived
with
incredible
frugality
that
he
might
save
a
purse
for
his
future
operations
in
this
manner
had
he
proceeded
for
the
space
of
ten
months
during
which
he
acquired
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
city
of
paris
when
his
curiosity
was
attracted
by
certain
peculiarities
in
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
lived
in
one
of
the
upper
apartments
belonging
to
the
house
in
which
he
himself
had
fixed
his
habitation
this
was
a
tall
thin
meagre
figure
with
a
long
black
beard
an
aquiline
nose
a
brown
complexion
and
a
most
piercing
vivacity
in
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
fifty
wore
the
persian
habit
and
there
was
a
remarkable
severity
in
his
aspect
and
demeanour
he
and
our
adventurer
had
been
for
some
time
and
according
to
the
laudable
custom
in
these
days
had
hitherto
remained
as
much
estranged
to
one
another
as
if
they
had
lived
on
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
but
of
late
the
persian
seemed
to
regard
our
hero
with
particular
attention
when
they
chanced
to
meet
on
the
staircase
or
elsewhere
he
bowed
to
ferdinand
with
great
solemnity
and
complimented
him
with
the
pas
he
even
proceeded
in
the
course
of
this
communication
to
open
his
mouth
and
salute
him
with
a
and
sometimes
made
the
common
remarks
upon
the
weather
fathom
who
was
naturally
complaisant
did
not
discourage
these
advances
on
the
contrary
he
behaved
to
him
with
marks
of
particular
respect
and
one
day
desired
the
favour
of
his
company
to
breakfast
this
invitation
the
stranger
declined
with
due
acknowledgment
on
pretence
of
being
out
of
order
and
in
the
meantime
our
adventurer
bethought
himself
of
questioning
the
landlord
concerning
his
outlandish
guest
his
curiosity
was
rather
inflamed
than
satisfied
with
the
information
he
could
obtain
from
this
quarter
for
all
he
learned
was
that
the
persian
went
by
the
name
of
ali
beker
and
that
he
had
lived
in
the
house
for
the
space
of
four
months
in
a
most
solitary
and
parsimonious
manner
without
being
visited
by
one
living
soul
that
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
he
had
been
often
heard
to
groan
dismally
in
the
night
and
even
to
exclaim
in
an
unknown
language
as
if
he
had
laboured
under
some
grievous
affliction
and
though
the
first
transports
of
his
grief
had
subsided
it
was
easy
to
perceive
he
still
indulged
a
melancholy
for
the
tears
were
frequently
observed
to
trickle
down
his
beard
the
commissaire
of
the
quarter
had
at
first
ordered
this
oriental
to
be
watched
in
his
outgoings
according
to
the
maxims
of
the
french
police
but
his
life
was
found
so
regular
and
inoffensive
that
this
precaution
was
soon
set
aside
any
man
of
humane
sentiments
from
the
knowledge
of
these
particulars
would
have
been
prompted
to
offer
his
services
to
the
forlorn
stranger
but
as
our
hero
was
devoid
of
all
these
infirmities
of
human
nature
it
was
necessary
that
other
motives
should
produce
the
same
effect
his
curiosity
therefore
joined
with
the
hopes
of
converting
the
confidence
of
ali
to
his
own
emolument
effectually
impelled
him
towards
his
acquaintance
and
in
a
little
time
they
began
to
relish
the
conversation
of
each
other
for
as
the
reader
may
have
already
observed
fathom
possessed
all
the
arts
of
insinuation
and
had
discernment
enough
to
perceive
an
air
of
dignity
in
the
persian
which
the
humility
of
his
circumstances
could
not
conceal
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
good
understanding
not
without
a
tincture
of
letters
perfectly
well
bred
though
in
a
ceremonious
style
extremely
moral
in
his
discourse
and
scrupulously
nice
in
his
notions
of
honour
our
hero
conformed
himself
in
all
respects
to
the
other
opinions
and
managed
his
discretion
so
as
to
pass
upon
him
for
a
gentleman
reduced
by
misfortunes
to
the
exercise
of
an
employment
which
was
altogether
unsuitable
to
his
birth
and
quality
he
made
earnest
and
repeated
tenders
of
his
good
offices
to
the
stranger
and
pressed
him
to
make
use
of
his
purse
with
such
cordial
perseverance
that
at
length
reserve
was
overcome
and
he
condescended
to
borrow
of
him
a
small
sum
which
in
all
probability
saved
his
life
for
he
had
been
driven
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
want
before
he
would
accept
of
this
assistance
fathom
having
gradually
stole
into
his
good
graces
began
to
take
notice
of
many
piteous
sighs
that
escaped
him
in
the
moments
of
their
intercourse
and
seemed
to
denote
an
heart
fraught
with
woe
and
on
pretence
of
administering
consolation
and
counsel
begged
leave
to
know
the
cause
of
his
distress
observing
that
his
mind
would
be
disburdened
by
such
communication
and
perhaps
his
grief
alleviated
by
some
means
which
they
might
jointly
concert
and
execute
in
his
behalf
ali
thus
solicited
would
often
shake
his
head
with
marks
of
extreme
sorrow
and
despondence
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
declared
that
his
distress
was
beyond
the
power
of
any
remedy
but
death
and
that
by
making
our
hero
his
confidant
he
should
only
extend
his
unhappiness
to
a
friend
without
feeling
the
least
remission
of
his
own
torture
notwithstanding
these
repeated
declarations
ferdinand
who
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
mind
of
man
to
know
that
such
importunity
is
seldom
or
never
disagreeable
redoubled
his
instances
together
with
his
expressions
of
sympathy
and
esteem
until
the
stranger
was
prevailed
upon
to
gratify
his
curiosity
and
benevolence
having
therefore
secured
the
chamber
door
one
night
while
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were
asleep
the
unfortunate
ali
disclosed
himself
in
these
words
chapter
the
history
of
the
noble
castilian
i
should
be
ungrateful
as
well
as
unwise
did
i
longer
resist
the
desire
you
express
to
know
the
particulars
of
that
destiny
which
hath
driven
me
to
this
miserable
disguise
and
rendered
me
in
all
considerations
the
most
wretched
of
men
i
have
felt
your
friendship
am
confident
of
your
honour
and
though
my
misfortunes
are
such
as
can
never
be
repaired
because
i
am
utterly
cut
off
from
hope
which
is
the
wretch
last
comfort
yet
i
may
by
your
means
be
enabled
to
bear
them
with
some
degree
of
fortitude
and
resignation
know
then
my
name
is
not
ali
neither
am
i
of
persian
extraction
i
had
once
the
honour
to
own
myself
a
castilian
and
was
under
the
appellation
of
don
diego
de
zelos
respected
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
of
that
kingdom
judge
then
how
severe
that
distress
must
be
which
compels
a
spaniard
to
renounce
his
country
his
honours
and
his
name
my
youth
was
not
spent
in
inglorious
ease
neither
did
it
waste
unheeded
in
the
rolls
of
fame
before
i
had
attained
the
age
of
nineteen
i
was
twice
wounded
in
battle
i
once
fortunately
recovered
the
standard
of
the
regiment
to
which
i
belonged
after
it
had
been
seized
by
the
enemy
and
at
another
occasion
made
shift
to
save
the
life
of
my
colonel
when
he
lay
at
the
mercy
of
an
enraged
barbarian
he
that
thinks
i
recapitulate
these
particulars
out
of
ostentation
does
wrong
to
the
unhappy
don
diego
de
zelos
who
in
having
performed
these
little
acts
of
gallantry
thinks
he
has
done
nothing
but
simply
approved
himself
worthy
of
being
called
a
castilian
i
mean
only
to
do
justice
to
my
own
character
and
to
make
you
acquainted
with
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
of
my
life
it
was
my
fate
during
my
third
campaign
to
command
a
troop
of
horse
in
the
regiment
of
don
gonzales
orgullo
between
whom
and
my
father
a
family
feud
had
long
been
maintained
with
great
enmity
and
that
gentleman
did
not
leave
me
without
reason
to
believe
he
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
of
exercising
his
resentment
upon
his
adversary
son
for
he
withheld
from
me
that
countenance
which
my
enjoyed
and
found
means
to
subject
me
to
divers
mortifications
of
which
i
was
not
at
liberty
to
complain
these
i
bore
in
silence
for
some
time
as
part
of
my
probation
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
resolved
nevertheless
to
employ
my
interest
at
court
for
a
removal
into
another
corps
and
to
take
some
future
opportunity
of
explaining
my
sentiments
to
don
gonzales
upon
the
injustice
of
his
behaviour
while
i
animated
myself
with
these
sentiments
against
the
discouragements
i
underwent
and
the
hard
duty
to
which
i
was
daily
exposed
it
was
our
fate
to
be
concerned
in
the
battle
of
saragossa
where
our
regiment
was
so
severely
handled
by
the
english
infantry
that
it
was
forced
to
give
ground
with
the
loss
of
one
half
of
its
officers
and
men
don
gonzales
who
acted
as
brigadier
in
another
wing
being
informed
of
our
fate
and
dreading
the
disgrace
of
his
corps
which
had
never
turned
back
to
the
enemy
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
riding
across
the
field
at
full
speed
rallied
our
broken
squadrons
and
led
us
back
to
the
charge
with
such
intrepidity
of
behaviour
as
did
not
fail
to
inspire
us
all
with
uncommon
courage
and
alacrity
for
my
own
part
i
thought
myself
doubly
interested
to
distinguish
my
valour
not
only
on
account
of
my
own
glory
but
likewise
on
the
supposition
that
as
i
was
acting
under
the
eye
of
gonzales
my
conduct
would
be
narrowly
observed
i
therefore
exerted
myself
with
unusual
vigour
and
as
he
began
the
attack
with
the
remains
of
my
troop
fought
close
by
his
side
during
the
rest
of
the
engagement
i
even
acquired
his
applause
in
the
very
heat
of
battle
when
his
hat
was
struck
off
and
his
horse
fell
under
him
i
accommodated
and
remounted
him
upon
my
own
and
having
seized
for
my
own
use
another
that
belonged
to
a
common
trooper
attended
this
stern
commander
as
before
and
seconded
him
in
all
his
repeated
efforts
but
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
the
numbers
and
impetuosity
of
the
foe
and
don
gonzales
having
had
the
mortification
to
see
his
regiment
cut
in
pieces
and
the
greatest
part
of
the
army
routed
was
fain
to
yield
to
the
fortune
of
the
day
yet
he
retired
as
became
a
man
of
honour
and
a
castilian
that
is
he
marched
off
with
great
deliberation
in
the
rear
of
the
spanish
troops
and
frequently
faced
about
to
check
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
indeed
this
exercise
of
his
courage
had
cost
him
his
life
for
in
one
of
those
wheelings
he
was
left
almost
alone
and
a
small
party
of
the
portuguese
horse
had
actually
cut
off
our
communication
with
the
retreating
forces
of
spain
in
this
dilemma
we
had
no
other
chance
of
saving
our
lives
and
liberty
than
that
of
opening
a
passage
sword
in
hand
and
this
was
what
gonzales
instantly
resolved
to
attempt
we
accordingly
recommended
our
souls
to
god
and
charging
the
line
abreast
of
one
another
bore
down
all
opposition
and
were
in
a
fair
way
of
accomplishing
our
retreat
without
further
danger
but
the
gallant
orgullo
in
crossing
a
ditch
had
the
misfortune
to
be
thrown
from
his
horse
and
was
almost
the
same
instant
overtaken
by
one
of
the
portuguese
dragoons
whose
sword
was
already
suspended
over
his
head
as
he
lay
half
stunned
with
his
fall
when
i
rode
up
discharged
a
pistol
in
the
ruffian
brain
and
seating
my
colonel
on
his
horse
had
the
good
fortune
to
conduct
him
to
a
place
of
safety
here
he
was
provided
with
such
accommodation
as
his
case
required
for
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
and
dangerously
bruised
by
his
fall
and
when
all
the
necessary
steps
were
taken
towards
his
recovery
i
desired
to
know
if
he
had
any
further
commands
for
his
service
being
resolved
to
join
the
army
without
delay
i
thought
proper
to
communicate
this
question
by
message
because
he
had
not
spoke
one
word
to
me
during
our
retreat
notwithstanding
the
good
office
he
had
received
at
my
hands
a
reserve
which
i
attributed
to
his
pride
and
resented
accordingly
he
no
sooner
understood
my
intention
than
he
desired
to
see
me
in
his
apartment
and
as
near
as
i
can
remember
spoke
to
this
effect
were
your
father
don
alonzo
alive
i
should
now
in
consequence
of
your
behaviour
banish
every
suggestion
of
resentment
and
solicit
his
friendship
with
great
sincerity
yes
don
diego
your
virtue
hath
triumphed
over
that
enmity
i
bore
your
house
and
i
upbraid
myself
with
the
ungenerous
treatment
you
have
suffered
under
my
command
but
it
is
not
enough
for
me
to
withdraw
that
rigour
which
it
was
unjust
to
exercise
and
would
be
wicked
to
maintain
i
must
likewise
atone
for
the
injuries
you
have
sustained
and
make
some
suitable
acknowledgment
for
that
life
which
i
have
twice
owed
to
your
valour
and
generosity
whatever
interest
i
have
at
court
shall
be
employed
in
your
behalf
and
i
have
other
designs
in
your
favour
which
shall
be
disclosed
in
due
season
meanwhile
i
desire
you
will
still
add
one
obligation
to
the
debt
which
i
have
already
incurred
and
carry
this
billet
in
person
to
my
estifania
who
from
the
news
of
this
fatal
overthrow
must
be
in
despair
upon
my
so
saying
he
presented
a
letter
directed
to
his
lady
which
i
received
in
a
transport
of
joy
with
expressions
suitable
to
the
occasion
and
immediately
set
out
for
his
country
house
which
happened
to
be
about
thirty
leagues
from
the
spot
this
expedition
was
equally
glorious
and
interesting
for
my
thoughts
upon
the
road
were
engrossed
by
the
hope
of
seeing
don
orgullo
daughter
and
heiress
antonia
who
was
reported
to
be
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
and
the
most
amiable
accomplishments
however
ridiculous
it
may
seem
for
a
man
to
conceive
a
passion
for
an
object
which
he
hath
never
beheld
certain
it
is
my
sentiments
were
so
much
prepossessed
by
the
fame
of
her
qualifications
that
i
must
have
fallen
a
victim
to
her
charms
had
they
been
much
less
powerful
than
they
were
notwithstanding
the
fatigues
i
had
undergone
in
the
field
i
closed
not
an
eye
until
i
arrived
at
the
gate
of
gonzales
being
determined
to
precede
the
report
of
the
battle
that
madame
might
not
be
alarmed
for
the
life
of
her
husband
i
declared
my
errand
and
was
introduced
into
a
saloon
where
i
had
not
waited
above
three
minutes
when
my
colonel
lady
appeared
and
in
great
confusion
received
the
letter
exclaiming
heaven
grant
that
don
gonzales
be
well
in
reading
the
contents
she
underwent
a
variety
of
agitations
but
when
she
had
perused
the
whole
her
countenance
regained
its
serenity
and
regarding
me
with
an
air
of
ineffable
complacency
don
diego
said
she
while
i
lament
the
national
calamity
in
the
defeat
of
our
army
i
at
the
same
time
feel
the
most
sincere
pleasure
on
seeing
you
upon
this
occasion
and
according
to
the
directions
of
my
dear
lord
bid
you
heartily
welcome
to
this
house
as
his
preserver
and
friend
i
was
not
unacquainted
with
your
character
before
this
last
triumph
of
your
virtue
and
have
often
prayed
to
heaven
for
some
lucky
determination
of
that
fatal
quarrel
which
raged
so
long
between
the
family
of
gonzales
and
your
father
house
my
prayers
have
been
heard
the
reconciliation
is
now
effected
and
i
hope
nothing
will
ever
intervene
to
disturb
this
happy
to
this
polite
and
affectionate
declaration
i
made
such
a
reply
as
became
a
young
man
whose
heart
overflowed
with
joy
and
benevolence
and
desired
to
know
how
soon
her
answer
to
my
commander
would
be
ready
that
i
might
gratify
his
impatience
with
all
possible
despatch
after
having
thanked
me
for
this
fresh
proof
of
my
attachment
she
begged
i
would
retire
into
a
chamber
and
repose
myself
from
the
uncommon
fatigues
i
must
have
undergone
but
finding
i
persisted
in
the
resolution
of
returning
to
don
gonzales
without
allowing
myself
the
least
benefit
of
sleep
she
left
me
engaged
in
conversation
with
an
uncle
of
don
gonzales
who
lodged
in
the
house
and
gave
orders
that
a
collation
should
be
prepared
in
another
apartment
while
she
retired
to
her
closet
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband
in
less
than
an
hour
from
my
first
arrival
i
was
introduced
into
a
most
elegant
where
a
magnificent
entertainment
was
served
up
and
where
we
were
joined
by
donna
estifania
and
her
beautiful
daughter
the
fair
antonia
who
advancing
with
the
most
amiable
sweetness
thanked
me
in
very
warm
expressions
of
acknowledgment
for
the
generosity
of
my
conduct
towards
her
father
i
had
been
ravished
with
her
first
appearance
which
far
exceeded
my
imagination
and
my
faculties
were
so
disordered
by
this
address
that
i
answered
her
compliment
with
the
most
awkward
confusion
but
this
disorder
did
not
turn
to
my
prejudice
in
the
opinion
of
that
lovely
creature
who
has
often
told
me
in
the
sequel
that
she
gave
herself
credit
for
that
perplexity
in
my
behaviour
and
that
i
never
appeared
more
worthy
of
her
regard
and
affection
than
at
that
juncture
when
my
dress
was
discomposed
and
my
whole
person
disfigured
by
the
toils
and
duty
of
the
preceding
day
for
this
very
dishabille
presented
itself
to
her
reflection
as
the
immediate
effect
of
that
very
merit
by
which
i
was
entitled
to
her
esteem
wretch
that
i
am
to
survive
the
loss
of
such
an
excellent
woman
endeared
to
my
remembrance
by
the
most
tender
offices
of
wedlock
happily
exercised
for
the
space
of
years
forgive
these
tears
they
are
not
the
drops
of
weakness
but
remorse
not
to
trouble
you
with
idle
particulars
suffice
it
is
to
say
i
was
favoured
with
such
marks
of
distinction
by
madame
that
she
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
let
me
know
she
had
not
overacted
her
hospitality
and
while
we
sat
at
table
accosted
me
in
these
words
you
will
not
be
surprised
don
diego
at
my
expressions
of
regard
which
i
own
are
unusual
from
a
spanish
lady
to
a
young
cavalier
like
you
when
i
communicate
the
contents
of
this
letter
from
don
so
saying
she
put
the
billet
into
my
hand
and
i
read
these
words
or
words
to
this
effect
amiable
estifania
you
will
understand
that
i
am
as
well
as
a
person
can
possibly
be
who
hath
this
day
lived
to
see
the
army
of
his
king
defeated
if
you
would
know
the
particulars
of
this
unfortunate
action
your
curiosity
will
be
gratified
by
the
bearer
don
diego
de
zelos
to
whose
virtue
and
bravery
i
am
twice
indebted
for
my
life
i
therefore
desire
you
will
receive
him
with
that
respect
and
gratitude
which
you
shall
think
due
for
such
an
obligation
and
in
entertaining
him
dismiss
that
reserve
which
often
disgraces
the
spanish
hospitality
in
a
word
let
your
own
virtue
and
beneficence
conduct
you
upon
this
occasion
and
let
my
antonia
endeavours
be
joined
with
your
own
in
doing
honour
to
the
preserver
of
her
father
such
a
testimonial
could
not
fail
of
being
very
agreeable
to
a
young
soldier
who
by
this
time
had
begun
to
indulge
the
transporting
hope
of
being
happy
in
the
arms
of
the
adorable
antonia
i
professed
myself
extremely
happy
in
having
met
with
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
such
a
degree
of
my
colonel
esteem
entertained
them
with
a
detail
of
his
personal
prowess
in
the
battle
and
answered
all
their
questions
with
that
moderation
which
every
man
ought
to
preserve
in
speaking
of
his
own
behaviour
our
repast
being
ended
i
took
my
leave
of
the
ladies
and
at
parting
received
a
letter
from
donna
estifania
to
her
husband
together
with
a
ring
of
great
value
which
she
begged
i
would
accept
as
a
token
of
her
esteem
thus
loaded
with
honour
and
caresses
i
set
out
on
my
return
for
the
quarters
of
don
gonzales
who
could
scarce
credit
his
own
eyes
when
i
delivered
his
lady
billet
for
he
thought
it
impossible
to
perform
such
a
journey
in
so
short
a
time
when
he
had
glanced
over
the
paper
don
diego
said
he
by
your
short
stay
one
would
imagine
you
had
met
with
indifferent
reception
at
my
house
i
hope
estifania
has
not
been
deficient
in
her
duty
i
answered
this
question
by
assuring
him
my
entertainment
had
been
so
agreeable
in
all
respects
that
nothing
but
my
duty
to
him
could
have
induced
me
to
give
it
up
so
soon
he
then
turned
the
conversation
upon
antonia
and
hinted
his
intention
of
giving
her
in
marriage
to
a
young
cavalier
for
whom
he
had
a
particular
friendship
i
was
so
much
affected
by
this
insinuation
which
seemed
at
once
to
blast
all
my
hopes
of
love
and
happiness
that
the
blood
forsook
my
face
i
was
seized
with
an
universal
trepidation
and
even
obliged
to
retire
on
pretence
of
being
suddenly
taken
ill
though
gonzales
seemed
to
impute
this
disorder
to
fatigue
and
want
of
rest
he
in
his
heart
ascribed
it
to
the
true
cause
and
after
having
sounded
my
sentiments
to
his
own
satisfaction
blessed
me
with
a
declaration
importing
that
i
was
the
person
upon
whom
he
had
pitched
for
a
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
a
repetition
of
what
passed
on
this
interesting
occasion
but
proceed
to
observe
that
his
intention
in
my
favour
was
far
from
being
disagreeable
to
his
lady
and
that
in
a
little
time
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
espouse
the
charming
antonia
who
submitted
to
the
will
of
her
father
without
reluctance
soon
after
this
happy
event
i
was
by
the
influence
of
don
gonzales
joined
to
my
own
interest
promoted
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
and
served
with
honour
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
war
after
the
treaty
of
utrecht
i
was
employed
in
reducing
the
catalans
to
their
allegiance
and
in
an
action
with
those
obstinate
rebels
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
my
who
by
that
time
was
preferred
to
the
rank
of
a
the
virtuous
estifania
did
not
long
survive
this
melancholy
accident
and
the
loss
of
these
indulgent
parents
made
such
a
deep
impression
upon
the
tender
heart
of
my
antonia
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
removing
her
from
a
place
in
which
every
object
served
to
cherish
her
grief
to
a
pleasant
villa
near
the
city
of
seville
which
i
purchased
on
account
of
its
agreeable
situation
that
i
might
the
more
perfectly
enjoy
the
possession
of
my
amiable
partner
who
could
no
longer
brook
the
thoughts
of
another
separation
peace
was
no
sooner
than
i
obtained
leave
to
resign
my
commission
and
i
wholly
devoted
myself
to
the
joys
of
a
domestic
life
heaven
seemed
to
smile
upon
our
union
by
blessing
us
with
a
son
whom
however
it
was
pleased
to
recall
in
his
infancy
to
our
unspeakable
grief
and
mortification
but
our
mutual
chagrin
was
afterwards
alleviated
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
who
seemed
born
with
every
accomplishment
to
excite
the
love
and
admiration
of
mankind
why
did
nature
debase
such
a
masterpiece
with
the
mixture
of
an
alloy
which
hath
involved
herself
and
her
whole
family
in
perdition
but
the
ways
of
providence
are
unsearchable
she
hath
paid
the
debt
of
her
degeneracy
peace
be
with
her
soul
the
honour
of
my
family
is
vindicated
though
by
a
sacrifice
which
hath
robbed
me
of
everything
else
that
is
valuable
in
life
and
ruined
my
peace
past
all
redemption
yes
my
friend
all
the
tortures
that
human
tyranny
can
inflict
would
be
ease
tranquillity
and
delight
to
the
unspeakable
pangs
and
horrors
i
have
felt
but
to
return
from
this
serafina
which
was
the
name
of
that
little
darling
as
she
grew
up
not
only
disclosed
all
the
natural
graces
of
external
beauty
but
likewise
manifested
the
most
engaging
sweetness
of
disposition
and
a
capacity
for
acquiring
with
ease
all
the
accomplishments
of
her
sex
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
a
parent
raptures
in
the
contemplation
of
such
a
fair
blossom
she
was
the
only
pledge
of
our
love
she
was
presumptive
heiress
to
a
large
fortune
and
likely
to
be
the
sole
representative
of
two
noble
castilian
families
she
was
the
delight
of
all
who
saw
her
and
a
theme
of
praise
for
every
tongue
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
education
of
such
a
child
was
neglected
indeed
it
wholly
engrossed
the
attention
of
me
and
my
antonia
and
her
proficiency
rewarded
our
care
before
she
had
attained
the
age
of
fifteen
she
was
mistress
of
every
elegant
qualification
natural
and
acquired
her
person
was
by
that
time
the
confessed
pattern
of
beauty
her
voice
was
enchantingly
sweet
and
she
touched
the
lute
with
the
most
ravishing
dexterity
heaven
and
earth
how
did
my
breast
dilate
with
joy
at
the
thoughts
of
having
given
birth
to
such
perfection
how
did
my
heart
gush
with
paternal
fondness
whenever
i
beheld
this
ornament
of
my
name
and
what
scenes
of
endearing
transport
have
i
enjoyed
with
my
antonia
in
mutual
congratulation
upon
our
parental
happiness
serafina
accomplished
as
she
was
could
not
fail
to
make
conquests
among
the
spanish
cavaliers
who
are
famous
for
sensibility
in
love
indeed
she
never
appeared
without
a
numerous
train
of
admirers
and
though
we
had
bred
her
up
in
that
freedom
of
conversation
and
intercourse
which
holds
a
middle
space
between
the
french
licence
and
spanish
restraint
she
was
now
so
much
exposed
to
the
addresses
of
promiscuous
gallantry
that
we
found
it
necessary
to
retrench
the
liberty
of
our
house
and
behave
to
our
male
visitants
with
great
reserve
and
circumspection
that
our
honour
and
peace
might
run
no
risk
from
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
our
daughter
this
caution
produced
overtures
from
a
great
many
young
gentlemen
of
rank
and
distinction
who
courted
my
alliance
by
demanding
serafina
in
marriage
and
from
the
number
i
had
actually
selected
one
person
who
was
in
all
respects
worthy
the
possession
of
such
an
inestimable
prize
his
name
was
don
manuel
de
mendoza
his
birth
was
noble
and
his
character
dignified
with
repeated
acts
of
generosity
and
virtue
yet
before
i
would
signify
to
him
my
approbation
of
his
suit
i
resolved
to
inform
myself
whether
or
not
the
heart
of
serafina
was
totally
unengaged
and
indifferent
to
any
other
object
that
i
might
not
lay
a
tyrannical
restraint
upon
her
inclinations
the
result
of
my
inquiry
was
a
full
conviction
of
her
having
hitherto
been
deaf
to
the
voice
of
love
and
this
piece
of
information
together
with
my
own
sentiments
in
his
favour
i
communicated
to
don
manuel
who
heard
these
tidings
with
transports
of
gratitude
and
joy
he
was
immediately
favoured
with
opportunities
of
acquiring
the
affection
of
my
daughter
and
his
endeavours
were
at
first
received
with
such
respectful
civility
as
might
have
been
easily
warmed
into
a
mutual
passion
had
not
the
evil
genius
of
our
family
interposed
o
my
friend
how
shall
i
describe
the
depravity
of
that
unhappy
sentiments
how
recount
the
particulars
of
my
own
dishonour
i
that
am
descended
from
a
long
line
of
illustrious
castilians
who
never
received
an
injury
they
did
not
revenge
but
washed
away
every
blemish
in
their
fame
with
the
blood
of
those
who
attempted
to
stain
it
in
that
circumstance
i
have
imitated
the
example
of
my
glorious
progenitors
and
that
consideration
alone
hath
supported
me
against
all
the
assaults
of
despair
as
i
grudged
no
pains
and
expense
in
perfecting
the
education
of
serafina
my
doors
were
open
to
every
person
who
made
an
extraordinary
figure
in
the
profession
of
those
amusing
sciences
in
which
she
delighted
the
house
of
don
diego
de
zelos
was
a
little
academy
for
painting
poetry
and
music
and
heaven
decreed
that
it
should
fall
a
sacrifice
to
its
regard
for
these
fatal
and
delusive
arts
among
other
preceptors
it
was
her
fate
to
be
under
the
instruction
of
a
cursed
german
who
though
his
profession
was
drawing
understood
the
elements
and
theory
of
music
possessed
a
large
fund
of
learning
and
taste
and
was
a
person
remarkable
for
his
agreeable
conversation
this
traitor
who
like
you
had
lost
one
eye
i
not
only
admitted
into
my
house
for
the
improvement
of
my
daughter
but
even
distinguished
with
particular
marks
of
confidence
and
favour
little
thinking
he
had
either
inclination
or
capacity
to
debauch
the
sentiments
of
my
child
i
was
rejoiced
beyond
measure
to
see
with
what
alacrity
she
received
his
lessons
with
what
avidity
she
listened
to
his
discourse
which
was
always
equally
moral
instructing
and
entertaining
antonia
seemed
to
vie
with
me
in
expressions
of
regard
for
this
accomplished
stranger
whom
she
could
not
help
supposing
to
be
a
person
of
rank
and
family
reduced
to
his
present
situation
by
some
unfortunate
vicissitude
of
fate
i
was
disposed
to
concur
with
this
opinion
and
actually
conjured
him
to
make
me
his
confidant
with
such
protestations
as
left
him
no
room
to
doubt
my
honour
and
beneficence
but
he
still
persisted
in
declaring
himself
the
son
of
an
obscure
mechanic
in
bohemia
an
origin
to
which
surely
no
man
would
pretend
who
had
the
least
claim
to
nobility
of
birth
while
i
was
thus
undeceived
in
my
conjecture
touching
his
birth
and
quality
i
was
confirmed
in
an
opinion
of
his
integrity
and
moderation
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
of
honour
in
despite
of
the
lowness
of
his
pedigree
nevertheless
he
was
at
bottom
a
most
perfidious
wretch
and
all
this
modesty
and
were
the
effects
of
the
most
villanous
dissimulation
a
cloak
under
which
he
unsuspected
robbed
me
of
my
honour
and
my
peace
not
to
trouble
you
with
particulars
the
recital
of
which
would
tear
my
with
indignation
and
remorse
i
shall
only
observe
that
by
the
power
of
his
infernal
insinuation
he
fascinated
the
heart
of
serafina
brought
over
antonia
herself
to
the
interests
of
his
passion
and
at
once
detached
them
both
from
their
duty
and
religion
heaven
and
earth
how
dangerous
how
irresistible
is
the
power
of
infatuation
while
i
remained
in
the
midst
of
this
blind
security
waiting
for
the
nuptials
of
my
daughter
and
indulging
myself
with
the
vain
prospect
of
her
approaching
felicity
antonia
found
means
to
protract
the
negotiations
of
the
marriage
by
representing
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
deprive
serafina
of
the
opportunity
she
then
had
of
profiting
by
the
german
instructions
and
upon
that
account
i
prevailed
upon
don
manuel
to
bridle
the
impatience
of
his
love
during
this
interval
as
i
one
evening
enjoyed
the
cool
air
in
my
own
garden
i
was
accosted
by
an
old
duenna
who
had
been
my
nurse
and
lived
in
the
family
since
the
time
of
my
my
duty
said
she
will
no
longer
permit
me
to
wink
in
silence
at
the
wrongs
i
see
you
daily
suffer
dismiss
that
german
from
your
house
without
delay
if
you
respect
the
glory
of
your
name
and
the
rights
of
our
holy
religion
the
stranger
is
an
abominable
heretic
and
grant
heaven
he
may
not
have
already
poisoned
the
minds
of
those
you
hold
most
i
had
been
extremely
alarmed
at
the
beginning
of
this
address
but
finding
the
imputation
limited
to
the
article
of
religion
in
which
thank
god
i
am
no
bigot
i
recovered
my
serenity
of
disposition
thanked
the
old
woman
for
her
zeal
commended
her
piety
and
encouraged
her
to
persevere
in
making
observations
on
such
subjects
as
should
concern
my
honour
and
my
quiet
we
live
in
such
a
world
of
wickedness
and
fraud
that
a
man
can
not
be
too
vigilant
in
his
own
defence
had
i
employed
such
spies
from
the
beginning
i
should
in
all
probability
have
been
at
this
day
in
possession
of
every
comfort
that
renders
life
agreeable
the
duenna
thus
authorised
employed
her
sagacity
with
such
success
that
i
had
reason
to
suspect
the
german
of
a
design
upon
the
heart
of
serafina
but
as
the
presumptions
did
not
amount
to
conviction
i
contented
myself
with
exiling
him
from
my
house
under
the
pretext
of
having
discovered
that
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
catholic
church
and
forthwith
appointed
a
day
for
the
celebration
of
my
daughter
marriage
with
don
manuel
de
mendoza
i
could
easily
perceive
a
cloud
of
melancholy
overspread
the
faces
of
serafina
and
her
mother
when
i
declared
these
my
resolutions
but
as
they
made
no
objection
to
what
i
proposed
i
did
not
at
that
time
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
true
motives
that
influenced
my
conduct
both
parties
were
probably
afraid
of
such
expostulation
meanwhile
preparations
were
made
for
the
espousals
of
serafina
and
notwithstanding
the
anxiety
i
had
undergone
on
account
of
her
connexion
with
the
german
i
began
to
think
that
her
duty
her
glory
had
triumphed
over
all
such
considerations
if
ever
they
had
been
entertained
because
she
and
even
antonia
seemed
to
expect
the
ceremony
with
resignation
though
the
features
of
both
still
retained
evident
marks
of
concern
which
i
willingly
imputed
to
the
mutual
prospect
of
their
separation
this
however
was
but
a
faithless
calm
that
soon
ah
too
soon
brought
forth
a
tempest
which
hath
wrecked
my
hopes
two
days
before
the
appointed
union
of
don
manuel
and
serafina
i
was
informed
by
the
duenna
that
while
she
accompanied
at
church
she
had
seen
her
receive
a
billet
from
an
old
woman
who
kneeling
at
her
side
had
conveyed
it
in
such
a
mysterious
manner
as
awakened
the
duenna
apprehensions
about
her
young
lady
she
had
therefore
hastened
home
to
communicate
this
piece
of
intelligence
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
messenger
before
she
could
have
time
to
deposit
her
trust
i
could
not
help
shivering
with
fearful
presages
upon
this
occasion
and
even
abhorring
the
person
to
whose
duty
and
zeal
i
was
beholden
for
the
intelligence
even
while
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
myself
that
the
inquiry
would
end
in
the
detection
of
some
paltry
intrigue
between
the
maid
and
her
own
gallant
i
intercepted
her
in
returning
from
church
and
commanding
her
to
follow
me
to
a
convenient
place
extorted
from
her
by
dint
of
threats
the
fatal
letter
which
i
read
to
this
effect
the
whole
business
of
my
life
o
divine
serafina
will
be
to
repay
that
affection
i
have
been
so
happy
as
to
engage
with
what
transport
then
shall
i
obey
your
summons
in
performing
that
enterprise
which
will
rescue
you
from
the
bed
of
a
detested
rival
and
put
myself
in
full
possession
of
a
jewel
which
i
value
infinitely
more
than
life
yes
adorable
creature
i
have
provided
everything
for
our
escape
and
at
midnight
will
attend
you
in
your
own
apartment
from
whence
you
shall
be
conveyed
into
a
land
of
liberty
and
peace
where
you
will
unmolested
enjoy
the
purity
of
that
religion
you
have
espoused
and
in
full
security
bless
the
arms
of
your
ever
faithful
were
you
a
fond
parent
a
tender
husband
and
a
noble
castilian
i
should
not
need
to
mention
the
unutterable
horrors
that
took
possession
of
my
bosom
when
i
perused
this
accursed
letter
by
which
i
learned
the
apostasy
disobedience
and
degeneracy
of
my
idolised
serafina
who
had
overthrown
and
destroyed
the
whole
plan
of
felicity
which
i
had
erected
and
blasted
all
the
glories
of
my
name
and
when
the
wretched
messenger
terrified
by
my
menaces
and
agitation
confessed
that
antonia
herself
was
privy
to
the
guilt
of
her
daughter
whom
she
had
solemnly
betrothed
to
that
vile
german
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
that
by
her
connivance
this
plebeian
intended
that
very
night
to
bereave
me
of
my
child
i
was
for
some
moments
stupefied
with
grief
and
amazement
that
gave
way
to
an
ecstasy
of
rage
which
had
terminated
in
despair
and
distraction
i
now
tremble
and
my
head
grows
giddy
with
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
occasion
behold
how
the
drops
trickle
down
my
forehead
this
agony
is
a
fierce
and
familiar
visitant
i
shall
banish
it
anon
i
summoned
my
pride
my
resentment
to
my
assistance
these
are
the
cordials
that
support
me
against
all
other
reflections
those
were
the
auxiliaries
that
enabled
me
in
the
day
of
trial
to
perform
that
sacrifice
which
my
honour
demanded
in
a
strain
so
loud
as
to
drown
the
cries
of
nature
love
and
compassion
yes
they
espoused
that
glory
which
humanity
would
have
betrayed
and
my
revenge
was
noble
though
unnatural
my
scheme
was
soon
laid
my
resolution
soon
taken
i
privately
confined
the
wretch
who
had
been
the
industrious
slave
of
this
infamous
conspiracy
that
she
might
take
no
step
to
frustrate
or
interrupt
the
execution
of
my
design
then
repairing
to
the
house
of
an
apothecary
who
was
devoted
to
my
service
communicated
my
intention
which
he
durst
not
condemn
and
could
not
reveal
without
breaking
the
oath
of
secrecy
i
had
imposed
and
he
furnished
me
with
two
vials
of
poison
for
the
dismal
catastrophe
i
had
planned
thus
provided
i
on
pretence
of
sudden
business
at
seville
carefully
avoided
the
dear
the
wretched
pair
whom
i
had
devoted
to
death
that
my
heart
might
not
relent
by
means
of
those
tender
ideas
which
the
sight
of
them
would
have
infallibly
inspired
and
when
daylight
vanished
took
my
station
near
that
part
of
the
house
through
which
the
villain
must
have
entered
on
his
hellish
purpose
there
i
stood
in
a
state
of
horrid
expectation
my
soul
ravaged
with
the
different
passions
that
assailed
it
until
the
fatal
moment
arrived
when
i
perceived
the
traitor
approach
the
window
of
a
lower
apartment
which
led
into
that
of
serafina
and
gently
lifting
the
casement
which
was
purposely
left
unsecured
insinuated
half
of
his
body
into
the
house
then
rushing
upon
him
in
a
transport
of
fury
i
plunged
my
sword
into
his
heart
crying
villain
receive
the
reward
of
thy
treachery
and
the
steel
was
so
well
aimed
as
to
render
a
repetition
of
the
stroke
unnecessary
he
uttered
one
groan
and
fell
breathless
at
my
feet
exulting
with
this
first
success
of
my
revenge
i
penetrated
into
the
chamber
where
the
robber
of
my
peace
was
expected
by
the
unhappy
serafina
and
her
mother
who
seeing
me
enter
with
a
most
savage
aspect
and
a
sword
reeking
with
the
vengeance
i
had
taken
seemed
almost
petrified
with
fear
behold
said
i
the
blood
of
that
base
plebeian
who
made
an
attempt
upon
the
honour
of
my
house
your
conspiracy
against
the
unfortunate
don
diego
de
zelos
is
now
discovered
that
presumptuous
slave
the
favoured
orlando
is
now
no
scarce
had
i
pronounced
these
words
when
a
loud
scream
was
uttered
by
both
the
unhappy
victims
if
orlando
is
slain
cried
the
infatuated
serafina
what
have
i
to
do
with
life
o
my
dear
lord
my
husband
and
my
lover
how
are
our
promised
joys
at
once
cut
off
here
strike
my
father
complete
your
barbarous
sacrifice
the
spirit
of
the
murdered
orlando
still
hovers
for
his
these
frantic
exclamations
in
which
she
was
joined
by
antonia
kept
up
the
fury
of
my
resentment
which
by
meekness
and
submission
might
have
been
weakened
and
rendered
ineffectual
yes
hapless
wretches
i
replied
ye
shall
enjoy
your
wish
the
honour
of
my
name
requires
that
both
shall
die
yet
i
will
not
mangle
the
breast
of
antonia
on
which
i
have
so
often
reposed
i
will
not
shed
the
blood
of
zelos
nor
disfigure
the
beauteous
form
of
serafina
on
which
i
have
so
often
gazed
with
wonder
and
unspeakable
delight
here
is
an
elixir
to
which
i
trust
the
consummation
of
my
so
saying
i
emptied
the
vials
into
separate
cups
and
presenting
one
in
each
hand
the
miserable
the
fair
offenders
instantly
received
the
destined
draughts
which
they
drank
without
hesitation
then
praying
to
heaven
for
the
wretched
don
diego
sunk
upon
the
same
couch
and
expired
without
a
groan
o
beverage
o
happy
composition
by
which
all
the
miseries
of
life
are
so
easily
cured
such
was
the
fate
of
antonia
and
serafina
these
hands
were
the
instruments
that
deprived
them
of
life
these
eyes
beheld
them
the
richest
prize
that
death
had
ever
won
powers
supreme
does
don
diego
live
to
make
this
recapitulation
i
have
done
my
duty
but
ah
i
am
haunted
by
the
furies
of
remorse
i
am
tortured
with
the
incessant
stings
of
remembrance
and
regret
even
now
the
images
of
my
wife
and
daughter
present
themselves
to
my
imagination
all
the
scenes
of
happiness
i
have
enjoyed
as
a
lover
husband
and
parent
all
the
endearing
hopes
i
have
cherished
now
pass
in
review
before
me
embittering
the
circumstances
of
my
inexpressible
woe
and
i
consider
myself
as
a
solitary
outcast
from
all
the
comforts
of
society
but
enough
of
these
unmanly
complaints
the
yearnings
of
nature
are
too
importunate
having
completed
my
vengeance
i
retired
into
my
closet
and
furnishing
myself
with
some
ready
money
and
jewels
of
considerable
value
went
into
the
stable
saddled
my
favourite
steed
which
i
instantly
mounted
and
before
the
tumults
of
my
breast
subsided
found
myself
at
the
town
of
lucar
there
i
learned
from
inquiry
that
there
was
a
dutch
bark
in
the
harbour
ready
to
sail
upon
which
i
addressed
myself
to
the
master
who
for
a
suitable
gratification
was
prevailed
upon
to
weigh
anchor
that
same
night
so
that
embarking
without
delay
i
soon
bid
eternal
adieu
to
my
native
country
it
was
not
from
reason
and
reflection
that
i
took
these
measures
for
my
personal
safety
but
in
consequence
of
an
involuntary
instinct
that
seems
to
operate
in
the
animal
machine
while
the
faculty
of
thinking
is
suspended
to
what
a
dreadful
reckoning
was
i
called
when
reason
resumed
her
function
you
may
believe
me
my
friend
when
i
assure
you
that
i
should
not
have
outlived
those
tragedies
i
acted
had
i
not
been
restrained
from
doing
violence
upon
myself
by
certain
considerations
which
no
man
of
honour
ought
to
set
aside
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
falling
ingloriously
by
the
hand
of
an
executioner
and
entailing
disgrace
upon
a
family
that
knew
no
stain
and
i
was
deterred
from
putting
an
end
to
my
own
misery
by
the
apprehension
of
posthumous
censure
which
would
have
represented
me
as
a
desponding
wretch
utterly
destitute
of
that
patience
fortitude
and
resignation
which
are
the
characteristics
of
a
true
castilian
i
was
also
influenced
by
religious
motives
that
suggested
to
me
the
necessity
of
living
to
atone
by
my
sufferings
and
sorrow
for
the
guilt
i
had
incurred
in
complying
with
a
savage
punctilio
which
is
i
fear
displeasing
in
the
sight
of
heaven
these
were
the
reasons
that
opposed
my
entrance
into
that
peaceful
harbour
which
death
presented
to
my
view
and
they
were
soon
reinforced
by
another
principle
that
sanctioned
my
determination
to
continue
at
the
servile
oar
of
life
in
consequence
of
unfavourable
winds
our
vessel
for
some
days
made
small
progress
in
her
voyage
to
holland
and
near
the
coast
of
gallicia
we
were
joined
by
an
english
ship
from
vigo
the
master
of
which
gave
us
to
understand
that
before
he
set
sail
a
courier
had
arrived
from
madrid
at
that
place
with
orders
for
the
corregidore
to
prevent
the
escape
of
any
native
spaniard
by
sea
from
any
port
within
his
district
and
to
use
his
utmost
endeavours
to
apprehend
the
person
of
don
diego
de
zelos
who
was
suspected
of
treasonable
practices
against
the
state
such
an
order
with
a
minute
description
of
my
person
was
at
the
same
time
despatched
to
all
the
seaports
and
frontier
places
in
spain
you
may
easily
suppose
how
i
who
was
already
overwhelmed
with
distress
could
bear
this
aggravation
of
misfortune
and
disgrace
i
who
had
always
maintained
the
reputation
of
loyalty
which
was
acquired
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
and
the
expense
of
my
blood
to
deal
candidly
i
must
own
that
this
intelligence
roused
me
from
a
lethargy
of
grief
which
had
begun
to
overpower
my
faculties
i
immediately
imputed
this
dishonourable
charge
to
the
evil
offices
of
some
villain
who
had
basely
taken
the
advantage
of
my
deplorable
situation
and
i
was
inflamed
inspirited
with
the
desire
of
vindicating
my
fame
and
revenging
the
injury
thus
animated
i
resolved
to
disguise
myself
effectually
from
the
observation
of
those
spies
which
every
nation
finds
its
account
in
employing
in
foreign
countries
i
purchased
this
habit
from
the
dutch
navigator
in
whose
house
i
kept
myself
concealed
after
our
arrival
at
amsterdam
until
my
beard
was
grown
to
a
sufficient
length
to
favour
my
design
and
then
appeared
as
a
persian
dealer
in
jewels
as
i
could
gain
no
satisfactory
information
touching
myself
in
this
country
had
no
purpose
to
pursue
and
was
extremely
miserable
among
a
people
who
being
mercenary
and
unsocial
were
very
ill
adapted
to
alleviate
the
horrors
of
my
condition
i
gratified
my
landlord
for
his
important
services
with
the
best
part
of
my
effects
and
having
by
his
means
procured
a
certificate
from
the
magistracy
repaired
to
rotterdam
from
whence
i
set
out
in
a
travelling
carriage
for
antwerp
on
my
way
to
this
capital
hoping
with
a
succession
of
different
objects
to
mitigate
the
anguish
of
my
mind
and
by
the
most
industrious
inquiry
to
learn
such
particulars
of
that
false
impeachment
as
would
enable
me
to
take
measures
for
my
own
justification
as
well
as
for
projecting
a
plan
of
revenge
against
the
vile
perfidious
author
this
i
imagined
would
be
no
difficult
task
considering
the
friendship
and
intercourse
subsisting
between
the
spanish
and
french
nations
and
the
communicative
disposition
for
which
the
parisians
are
renowned
but
i
have
found
myself
egregiously
deceived
in
my
expectation
the
officers
of
police
in
this
city
are
so
inquisitive
and
vigilant
that
the
most
minute
action
of
a
stranger
is
scrutinised
with
great
severity
and
although
the
inhabitants
are
very
frank
in
discoursing
on
indifferent
subjects
they
are
at
the
same
time
extremely
cautious
in
avoiding
all
conversation
that
turns
upon
state
occurrences
and
maxims
of
government
in
a
word
the
peculiarity
of
my
appearance
subjects
me
so
much
to
particular
observation
that
i
have
hitherto
thought
proper
to
devour
my
griefs
in
silence
and
even
to
bear
the
want
of
almost
every
convenience
rather
than
hazard
a
premature
discovery
by
offering
my
jewels
to
sale
in
this
emergency
i
have
been
so
far
fortunate
as
to
become
acquainted
with
you
whom
i
look
upon
as
a
man
of
honour
and
humanity
indeed
i
was
at
first
sight
prepossessed
in
your
favour
for
notwithstanding
the
mistakes
which
men
daily
commit
in
judging
from
appearances
there
is
something
in
the
physiognomy
of
a
stranger
from
which
one
can
not
help
forming
an
opinion
of
his
character
and
disposition
for
once
my
penetration
hath
not
failed
me
your
behaviour
justifies
my
decision
you
have
treated
me
with
that
sympathy
and
respect
which
none
but
the
generous
will
pay
to
the
unfortunate
i
have
trusted
you
accordingly
i
have
put
my
life
my
honour
in
your
power
and
i
must
beg
leave
to
depend
upon
your
friendship
for
obtaining
that
satisfaction
for
which
alone
i
seek
to
live
your
employment
engages
you
in
the
gay
world
you
daily
mingle
with
the
societies
of
men
the
domestics
of
the
spanish
ambassador
will
not
shun
your
acquaintance
you
may
frequent
the
to
which
they
resort
and
in
the
course
of
these
occasions
unsuspected
inform
yourself
of
that
mysterious
charge
which
lies
heavy
on
the
fame
of
the
unfortunate
don
diego
i
must
likewise
implore
your
assistance
in
converting
my
jewels
into
money
that
i
may
breathe
independent
of
man
until
heaven
shall
permit
me
to
finish
this
weary
pilgrimage
of
life
chapter
a
flagrant
instance
of

virtue
in
the
manner
of
his
retreat
to
england
fathom
who
had
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
every
circumstance
of
this
disastrous
story
no
sooner
heard
it
concluded
than
with
an
aspect
of
generous
and
cordial
compassion
not
even
unattended
with
tears
he
condoled
the
lamentable
fate
of
don
diego
de
zelos
deplored
the
untimely
death
of
the
gentle
antonia
and
the
fair
serafina
and
undertook
the
interest
of
the
wretched
castilian
with
such
warmth
of
sympathising
zeal
as
drew
a
flood
from
his
eyes
while
he
wrung
his
benefactor
hand
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
those
were
literally
tears
of
joy
or
at

of
satisfaction
on
both
sides

wept
with
affection
and
attachment

his
care
but
far
from
discovering
the
true
source
of
his
tenderness
he
affected
to
dissuade
the
spaniard
from
parting
with
the
diamonds
which
he
counselled
him
to
reserve
for
a
more
pressing
occasion
and
in
the
meantime
earnestly
entreated
him
to
depend
upon
his
friendship
for
present
relief
this
generous
proffer
served
only
to
confirm
don
diego
resolution
which
he
forthwith
executed
by
putting
into
the
hands
of
ferdinand
jewels
to
the
value
of
a
thousand
crowns
and
desiring
him
to
detain
for
his
own
use
any
part
of
the
sum
they
would
raise
our
adventurer
thanked
him
for
the
good
opinion
he
entertained
of
his
integrity
an
opinion
fully
manifested
in
honouring
him
with
such
important
confidence
and
assured
him
he
would
transact
his
affairs
with
the
utmost
diligence
caution
and
despatch
the
evening
being
by
this
time
almost
consumed
these
new
allies
retired
separately
to
rest
though
each
passed
the
night
without
repose
in
very
different
reflections
the
castilian
being
as
usual
agitated
with
the
unceasing
pangs
of
his
unalterable
misery
interspersed
with
gleaming
hopes
of
revenge
and
fathom
being
kept
awake
with
revolving
plans
for
turning
his
credulity
to
his
own
advantage
from
the
nature
of
the
spaniard
situation
he
might
have
appropriated
the
jewels
to
himself
and
remained
in
paris
without
fear
of
a
prosecution
because
the
injured
party
had
by
the
above
narrative
left
his
life
and
liberty
at
but
he
did
not
think
himself
secure
from
the
personal
resentment
of
an
enraged
desperate
castilian
and
therefore
determined
to
withdraw
himself
privately
into
that
country
where
he
had
all
along
proposed
to
fix
the
standard
of
his
finesse
which
fortune
had
now
empowered
him
to
exercise
according
to
his
wish
bent
upon
this
retreat
he
went
abroad
in
the
morning
on
pretence
of
acting
in
the
concerns
of
his
friend
don
diego
and
having
hired
a
to
be
ready
at
the
dawning
of
next
day
returned
to
his
lodgings
where
he
cajoled
the
spaniard
with
a
feigned
report
of
his
negotiation
then
securing
his
most
valuable
effects
about
his
person
arose
with
the
cock
repaired
to
the
place
at
which
he
had
appointed
to
meet
the
postillion
with
the
carriage
and
set
out
for
england
without
further
delay
leaving
the
unhappy
zelos
to
the
horrors
of
indigence
and
the
additional
agony
of
this
fresh
disappointment
yet
he
was
not
the
only
person
affected
by
the
abrupt
departure
of
fathom
which
was
hastened
by
the
importunities
threats
and
reproaches
of
his
daughter
whom
he
had
debauched
under
promise
of
marriage
and
now
left
in
the
fourth
month
of
her
pregnancy
notwithstanding
the
dangerous
adventure
in
which
he
had
been
formerly
involved
by
travelling
in
the
night
he
did
not
think
proper
to
make
the
usual
halts
on
this
journey
for
sleep
or
refreshment
nor
did
he
once
quit
the
chaise
till
his
arrival
at
boulogne
which
he
reached
in
twenty
hours
after
his
departure
from
paris
here
he
thought
he
might
safely
indulge
himself
with
a
comfortable
meal
accordingly
he
bespoke
a
poulard
for
dinner
and
while
that
was
preparing
went
forth
to
view
the
city
and
harbour
when
he
beheld
the
white
cliffs
of
albion
his
heart
throbbed
with
all
the
joy
of
a
beloved
son
who
after
a
tedious
and
fatiguing
voyage
reviews
the
chimneys
of
his
father
house
he
surveyed
the
neighbouring
coast
of
england
with
fond
and
longing
eyes
like
another
moses
reconnoitring
the
land
of
canaan
from
the
top
of
mount
pisgah
and
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
was
he
inflamed
by
the
sight
that
instead
of
proceeding
to
calais
he
resolved
to
take
his
passage
directly
from
boulogne
even
if
he
should
hire
a
vessel
for
the
purpose
with
these
sentiments
he
inquired
if
there
was
any
ship
bound
for
england
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
the
master
of
a
small
bark
who
intended
to
weigh
anchor
for
deal
that
same
evening
at
high
water
transported
with
this
information
he
immediately
agreed
for
his
passage
sold
the
to
his
landlord
for
thirty
guineas
as
a
piece
of
furniture
for
which
he
could
have
no
further
use
purchased
a
portmanteau
together
with
some
linen
and
wearing
apparel
and
at
the
recommendation
of
his
host
took
into
his
service
an
extra
postillion
or
helper
who
had
formerly
worn
the
livery
of
a
travelling
marquis
this
new
domestic
whose
name
was
maurice
underwent
with
great
applause
the
examination
of
our
hero
who
perceived
in
him
a
fund
of
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
by
which
he
was
excellently
qualified
for
being
the
valet
of
an
adventurer
he
was
therefore
accommodated
with
a
suit
and
another
shirt
and
at
once
listed
under
the
banners
of
count
fathom
who
spent
the
whole
afternoon
in
giving
him
proper
instructions
for
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
having
settled
these
preliminaries
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
and
his
baggage
were
embarked
about
six
in
the
month
of
september
and
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
he
found
himself
benighted
upon
the
great
deep
of
which
before
the
preceding
day
he
had
never
enjoyed
even
the
most
distant
prospect
however
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
afraid
where
there
was
really
no
appearance
of
danger
and
the
agreeable
presages
of
future
fortune
supported
his
spirits
amidst
the
disagreeable
nausea
which
commonly
attends
landsmen
at
sea
until
he
was
set
ashore
upon
the
beach
at
deal
which
he
entered
in
good
health
about
seven
in
the
morning
like
caesar
however
he
found
some
difficulty
in
landing
on
account
of
the
swelling
surf
that
tumbled
about
with
such
violence
as
had
almost
overset
the
cutter
that
carried
him
on
shore
and
in
his
eagerness
to
jump
upon
the
strand
his
foot
slipped
from
the
side
of
the
boat
so
that
he
was
thrown
forwards
in
an
horizontal
direction
and
his
hands
were
the
first
parts
of
him
that
touched
english
ground
upon
this
occasion
he
in
imitation
of
scipio
behaviour
on
the
coast
of
africa
hailed
the
omen
and
grasping
a
handful
of
the
sand
was
heard
to
exclaim
in
the
italian
language
ah
ah
old
england
i
have
thee
as
he
walked
up
to
the
inn
followed
by
maurice
loaded
with
his
portmanteau
he
congratulated
himself
upon
his
happy
voyage
and
the
peaceable
possession
of
his
spoil
and
could
not
help
snuffing
up
the
british
air
with
marks
of
infinite
relish
and
satisfaction
his
first
care
was
to
recompense
himself
for
the
want
of
sleep
he
had
undergone
and
after
he
had
sufficiently
recruited
himself
with
several
hours
of
uninterrupted
repose
he
set
out
in
a
for
canterbury
where
he
took
a
place
in
the
london
stage
which
he
was
told
would
depart
next
morning
the
coach
being
already
full
on
this
very
first
day
of
his
arrival
he
perceived
between
the
english
and
the
people
among
whom
he
had
hitherto
lived
such
essential
difference
in
customs
appearance
and
way
of
living
as
inspired
him
with
high
notions
of
that
british
freedom
opulence
and
convenience
on
which
he
had
often
heard
his
mother
expatiate
on
the
road
he
feasted
his
eyesight
with
the
verdant
hills
covered
with
flocks
of
sheep
the
fruitful
vales
parcelled
out
into
cultivated
enclosures
the
very
cattle
seemed
to
profit
by
the
wealth
of
their
masters
being
large
sturdy
and
sleek
and
every
peasant
breathed
the
insolence
of
liberty
and
independence
in
a
word
he
viewed
the
plains
of
kent
with
a
lover
eye
and
his
ambition
becoming
romantic
could
not
help
fancying
himself
another
conqueror
of
the
isle
he
was
not
however
long
amused
by
these
vain
chimeras
which
soon
vanished
before
other
reflections
of
more
importance
and
solidity
his
imagination
it
must
be
owned
was
at
all
times
too
chaste
to
admit
those
overweening
hopes
which
often
mislead
the
mind
of
the
projector
he
had
studied
mankind
with
incredible
diligence
and
knew
perfectly
well
how
far
he
could
depend
on
the
passions
and
foibles
of
human
nature
that
he
might
now
act
consistent
with
his
former
sagacity
he
resolved
to
pass
himself
upon
his
for
a
french
gentleman
equally
a
stranger
to
the
language
and
country
of
england
in
order
to
glean
from
their
discourse
such
intelligence
as
might
avail
him
in
his
future
operations
and
his
lacquey
was
tutored
accordingly
chapter
some
account
of
his
those
who
had
taken
places
for
the
coach
understanding
the
sixth
seat
was
engaged
by
a
foreigner
determined
to
profit
by
his
ignorance
and
with
that
politeness
which
is
peculiar
to
this
happy
island
fixed
themselves
in
the
vehicle
in
such
a
manner
before
he
had
the
least
intimation
of
their
design
that
he
found
it
barely
practicable
to
insinuate
himself
sidelong
between
a
corpulent
quaker
and
a
fat
wapping
landlady
in
which
attitude
he
stuck
fast
like
a
thin
quarto
between
two
voluminous
dictionaries
on
a
bookseller
shelf
and
as
if
the
pain
and
inconvenience
of
such
compression
was
not
sufficient
matter
of
chagrin
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
entertained
themselves
with
laughing
at
his
ludicrous
station
the
jolly
dame
at
his
left
hand
observed
with
a
loud
exclamation
of
mirth
that
monsieur
would
be
soon
better
acquainted
with
a
buttock
of
english
beef
and
said
by
that
time
they
should
arrive
at
their
he
might
be
spitted
without
larding
yes
verily
replied
obadiah
who
was
a
wag
in
his
way
but
the
swine
fat
will
be
all
on
one
so
much
the
better
for
you
cried
mine
hostess
for
that
side
is
all
your
the
quaker
was
not
so
much
disconcerted
by
the
quickness
of
this
repartee
but
that
he
answered
with
great
deliberation
i
thank
thee
for
thy
love
but
will
not
profit
by
thy
loss
especially
as
i
like
not
the
savour
of
these
outlandish
fowls
they
are
profane
birds
of
passage
relished
only
by
the
children
of
vanity
like
the
plump
gentlewoman
took
umbrage
at
this
last
expression
which
she
considered
as
a
double
reproach
and
repeated
the
words
children
of
vanity
with
an
emphasis
of
resentment
i
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
said
she
there
more
vanity
than
midriff
in
that
great
belly
of
yours
for
all
your
pretending
to
humility
and
religion
sirrah
my
corporation
is
made
up
of
good
wholesome
english
fat
but
you
are
puffed
up
with
the
wind
of
vanity
and
delusion
and
when
it
begins
to
gripe
your
entrails
you
pretend
to
have
a
motion
and
then
get
up
and
preach
nonsense
yet
you
take
it
upon
you
to
call
your
betters
children
marry
come
up
goosecap
i
have
got
children
that
are
as
good
men
as
you
or
any
hypocritical
trembler
in
a
person
who
sat
opposite
to
the
quaker
hearing
this
remonstrance
which
seemed
pregnant
with
contention
interposed
in
the
conversation
with
a
conscious
leer
and
begged
there
might
be
no
rupture
between
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
by
this
remonstrance
he
relieved
obadiah
from
the
satire
of
this
female
orator
and
brought
the
whole
vengeance
of
her
elocution
upon
his
own
head
flesh
cried
she
with
all
the
ferocity
of
an
enraged
thalestris
none
of
your
names
yellowchaps
what
i
warrant
you
have
an
antipathy
to
flesh
because
you
yourself
are
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
i
suppose
you
are
some
poor
starved
journeyman
tailor
come
from
france
where
you
have
been
learning
to
cabbage
and
have
not
seen
a
good
meal
of
victuals
these
seven
years
you
have
been
living
upon
and
and
now
you
come
over
like
a
walking
atomy
with
a
rat
tail
at
your
wig
and
a
tinsey
jacket
and
so
forsooth
you
set
up
for
a
gentleman
and
pretend
to
find
fault
with
a
sirloin
of
roast
the
gentleman
heard
this
address
with
admirable
patience
and
when
she
had
rung
out
her
alarm
very
coolly
replied
anything
but
your
stinking
fish
madam
since
when
i
pray
have
you
travelled
in
and
left
off
your
old
profession
of
crying
oysters
in
winter
and
rotten
mackerel
in
june
you
was
then
known
by
the
name
of
kate
brawn
and
in
good
repute
among
the
in
thames
street
till
that
unlucky
amour
with
the
master
of
a
in
which
he
was
unfortunately
detected
by
his
own
spouse
but
you
seem
to
have
risen
by
that
fall
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
present
plight
though
considering
your
education
on
bear
quay
you
can
give
but
a
sorry
account
of
the
amazon
though
neither
exhausted
nor
dismayed
was
really
confounded
at
the
temper
and
assurance
of
this
antagonist
who
had
gathered
all
these
anecdotes
from
the
fertility
of
his
own
invention
after
a
short
pause
however
she
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
obloquy
sufficient
to
overwhelm
any
person
who
had
not
been
used
to
take
up
arms
against
such
seas
of
trouble
and
a
dispute
ensued
which
would
have
not
only
disgraced
the
best
orators
on
the
thames
but
even
have
made
a
figure
in
the
celebration
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
during
which
the
athenian
matrons
rallied
one
another
from
different
waggons
with
that
freedom
of
altercation
so
happily
preserved
in
this
our
age
and
country
such
a
redundancy
of
epithets
and
variety
of
metaphors
tropes
and
figures
were
uttered
between
these
opponents
that
an
epic
bard
would
have
found
his
account
in
listening
to
the
contest
which
in
all
probability
would
not
have
been
confined
to
words
had
it
not
been
interrupted
for
the
sake
of
a
young
woman
of
an
agreeable
countenance
and
modest
carriage
who
being
shocked
at
some
of
their
flowers
of
speech
and
terrified
by
the
menacing
looks
and
gestures
of
the
dame
began
to
scream
aloud
and
beg
leave
to
quit
the
coach
her
perturbation
put
an
end
to
the
high
debate
the
sixth
passenger
who
had
not
opened
his
mouth
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
with
assurances
of
protection
the
quaker
proposed
a
cessation
of
arms
the
male
disputant
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
assuring
the
company
he
had
entered
the
lists
for
their
entertainment
only
without
acquiring
the
least
grudge
or
to
the
fat
gentlewoman
whom
he
protested
he
had
never
seen
before
that
day
and
who
for
aught
he
knew
was
a
person
of
credit
and
reputation
he
then
held
forth
his
hand
in
token
of
amity
and
asked
pardon
of
the
offended
party
who
was
appeased
by
his
submission
and
in
testimony
of
her
benevolence
presented
to
the
other
female
whom
she
had
discomposed
an
bottle
filled
with
recommending
it
as
a
much
more
powerful
remedy
than
the
which
the
other
held
to
her
nose
peace
being
thus
in
a
treaty
comprehending
obadiah
and
all
present
it
will
not
be
improper
to
give
the
reader
some
further
information
touching
the
several
characters
assembled
in
this
vehicle
the
quaker
was
a
london
merchant
who
had
been
at
deal
superintending
the
repairs
of
a
ship
which
had
suffered
by
a
storm
in
the
downs
the
wapping
landlady
was
on
her
return
from
the
same
place
where
she
had
attended
the
payment
of
a
with
sundry
powers
of
attorney
granted
by
the
sailors
who
had
lived
upon
credit
at
her
house
her
competitor
in
fame
was
a
dealer
in
wine
a
smuggler
of
french
lace
and
a
petty
gamester
just
arrived
from
paris
in
the
company
of
an
english
barber
who
sat
on
his
right
hand
and
the
young
woman
was
daughter
of
a
country
curate
in
her
way
to
london
where
she
was
bound
apprentice
to
a
milliner
hitherto
fathom
had
sat
in
silent
astonishment
at
the
manners
of
his
which
far
exceeded
the
notions
he
had
preconceived
of
english
plainness
and
rusticity
he
found
himself
a
monument
of
that
disregard
and
contempt
which
a
stranger
never
fails
to
meet
with
from
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
and
saw
with
surprise
an
agreeable
young
creature
sit
as
solitary
and
unheeded
as
himself
he
was
indeed
allured
by
the
roses
of
her
complexion
and
the
innocence
of
her
aspect
and
began
to
repent
of
having
pretended
ignorance
of
the
language
by
which
he
was
restrained
from
exercising
his
eloquence
upon
her
heart
he
resolved
however
to
ingratiate
himself
if
possible
by
the
courtesy
and
politeness
of
dumb
show
and
for
that
purpose
put
his
eyes
in
motion
without
farther
delay
chapter
another
providential
deliverance
from
the
effects
of
the
ingenious
conjecture
during
these
deliberations
the
wine
merchant
with
a
view
to
make
a
parade
of
his
superior
parts
and
breeding
as
well
as
to
pave
the
way
for
a
match
at
backgammon
made
a
tender
of
his
to
our
adventurer
and
asked
in
bad
french
how
he
travelled
from
paris
this
question
produced
a
series
of
interrogations
concerning
the
place
of
abode
in
that
city
and
his
business
in
england
so
that
he
was
fain
to
practise
the
science
of
defence
and
answered
with
such
ambiguity
as
aroused
the
suspicion
of
the
smuggler
who
began
to
believe
our
hero
had
some
very
cogent
reason
for
evading
his
curiosity
he
immediately
set
his
reflection
at
work
and
after
various
conjectures
fixed
upon
being
the
young
pretender
big
with
this
supposition
he
eyed
him
with
the
most
earnest
attention
comparing
his
features
with
those
of
the
chevalier
portrait
which
he
had
seen
in
france
and
though
the
faces
were
as
unlike
as
any
two
human
faces
could
be
found
the
resemblance
so
striking
as
to
dispel
all
his
doubts
and
persuade
him
to
introduce
the
stranger
to
some
justice
on
the
road
a
step
by
which
he
would
not
only
manifest
his
zeal
for
the
protestant
succession
but
also
acquire
the
splendid
reward
proposed
by
parliament
to
any
person
who
should
apprehend
that
famous
adventurer
these
ideas
intoxicated
the
brain
of
this
man
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
that
he
actually
believed
himself
in
possession
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
amused
his
fancy
with
a
variety
of
magnificent
projects
to
be
executed
by
means
of
that
acquisition
until
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
halting
of
the
coach
at
the
inn
where
the
passengers
used
to
eat
their
breakfasts
waked
as
he
was
from
the
dream
of
happiness
it
had
made
such
impression
upon
his
mind
that
seeing
fathom
rise
up
with
an
intention
to
alight
he
took
it
for
granted
his
design
was
to
escape
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
called
aloud
for
assistance
in
the
king
name
our
hero
whose
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
very
often
supplied
the
place
of
courage
instead
of
being
terrified
at
this
assault
which
might
have
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
an
ordinary
villain
was
so
perfectly
master
of
every
circumstance
of
his
own
situation
as
to
know
at
once
that
the
aggressor
could
not
possibly
have
the
least
cause
of
complaint
against
him
and
therefore
imputing
this
violence
either
to
madness
or
mistake
very
deliberately
suffered
himself
to
be
made
prisoner
by
the
people
of
the
house
who
ran
to
the
coach
door
in
obedience
to
the
summons
of
the
wine
merchant
the
rest
of
the
company
were
struck
dumb
with
surprise
and
consternation
at
this
sudden
adventure
and
the
quaker
dreading
some
fell
resistance
on
the
side
of
the
outlandish
man
unpinned
the
other
coach
door
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
trundled
himself
into
the
mud
for
safety
the
others
seeing
the
temper
and
resignation
of
the
prisoner
soon
recovered
their
recollection
and
began
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
arrest
upon
which
the
captor
whose
teeth
chattered
with
terror
and
impatience
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
a
state
criminal
and
demanded
their
help
in
conveying
him
to
justice
luckily
for
both
parties
there
happened
to
be
at
the
inn
a
company
of
squires
just
returned
from
the
death
of
a
leash
of
hares
which
they
had
ordered
to
be
dressed
for
dinner
and
among
these
gentlemen
was
one
of
the
quorum
to
whom
the
accuser
had
immediate
recourse
marching
before
the
captive
who
walked
very
peaceably
between
the
landlord
and
one
of
his
waiters
and
followed
by
a
crowd
of
spectators
some
of
whom
had
secured
the
faithful
maurice
who
in
his
behaviour
closely
imitated
the
deliberation
of
his
master
in
this
order
did
the
procession
advance
to
the
apartment
in
which
the
magistrate
with
his
fellows
of
the
chase
sat
smoking
his
morning
pipe
over
a
tankard
of
strong
ale
and
the
smuggler
being
directed
to
the
right
person
may
it
please
your
worship
said
he
i
have
brought
this
foreigner
before
you
on
a
violent
suspicion
of
his
being
a
proclaimed
outlaw
and
i
desire
before
these
witnesses
that
my
title
may
be
made
good
to
the
reward
that
shall
become
due
upon
his
friend
replied
the
justice
i
know
nothing
of
you
or
your
titles
but
this
i
know
if
you
have
any
information
to
give
in
you
must
come
to
my
house
when
i
am
at
home
and
proceed
in
a
lawful
way
that
is
d
mind
me
if
you
swear
as
how
this
here
person
is
an
outlaw
then
if
so
be
as
he
has
nothing
to
say
to
the
contrary
my
clerk
shall
make
out
a
mittimus
and
so
to
jail
with
him
till
next
but
sir
answered
the
impeacher
this
is
a
case
that
admits
of
no
delay
the
person
i
have
apprehended
is
a
prisoner
of
consequence
to
the
how
fellor
cried
the
magistrate
interrupting
him
is
there
any
person
of
more
consequence
than
one
of
his
majesty
justices
of
the
peace
who
is
besides
a
considerable
member
of
the
landed
interest
d
know
sirrah
who
you
are
talking
to
if
you
do
go
about
your
business
i
believe
i
shall
lay
you
by
the
the
smuggler
fearing
his
prize
would
escape
through
the
ignorance
pride
and
obstinacy
of
this
country
justice
approached
his
worship
and
in
a
whisper
which
was
overheard
by
all
the
company
assured
him
he
had
indubitable
reason
to
believe
the
foreigner
was
no
other
than
the
pretender
eldest
son
at
mention
of
this
formidable
name
every
individual
of
the
audience
started
with
signs
of
terror
and
amazement
the
justice
dropped
his
pipe
recoiled
upon
his
chair
and
looking
most
ridiculously
aghast
exclaimed
seize
him
in
the
name
of
god
and
his
majesty
king
george
has
he
got
no
secret
arms
about
him
fathom
being
thus
informed
of
the
suspicion
under
which
he
stood
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
eagerness
with
which
the
spectators
flew
upon
him
and
suffered
himself
to
be
searched
with
great
composure
well
knowing
they
would
find
no
moveables
about
his
person
but
such
as
upon
examination
would
turn
to
his
account
he
therefore
very
calmly
presented
to
the
magistrate
his
purse
and
a
small
box
that
contained
his
jewels
and
in
the
french
language
desired
they
might
be
preserved
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
this
request
was
interpreted
by
the
accuser
who
at
the
same
time
laid
claim
to
the
booty
the
justice
took
charge
of
the
deposit
and
one
of
his
neighbours
having
undertaken
the
office
of
clerk
he
proceeded
to
the
examination
of
the
culprit
whose
papers
were
by
this
time
laid
on
the
table
before
him
stranger
said
he
you
stand
charged
with
being
son
of
the
pretender
to
these
realms
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
own
defence
our
hero
assured
him
in
the
french
language
that
he
was
falsely
impeached
and
demanded
justice
on
the
accuser
who
without
the
least
reason
had
made
such
a
malicious
attack
upon
the
life
and
honour
of
an
innocent
gentleman
the
smuggler
instead
of
acting
the
part
of
a
faithful
interpreter
told
his
worship
that
the
prisoner
answer
was
no
more
than
a
simple
denial
which
every
felon
would
make
who
had
nothing
else
to
plead
in
his
own
behalf
and
that
this
alone
was
a
strong
presumption
of
his
guilt
because
if
he
was
not
really
the
person
they
suspected
him
to
be
the
thing
would
speak
for
itself
for
if
he
was
not
the
young
pretender
who
then
was
he
this
argument
had
great
weight
with
the
justice
who
assuming
a
very
important
aspect
observed
very
true
friend
if
you
are
not
the
pretender
in
the
name
of
god
who
are
you
one
may
see
with
half
an
eye
that
he
is
no
better
than
a
promiscuous
ferdinand
now
began
to
repent
of
having
pretended
ignorance
of
the
english
language
as
he
found
himself
at
the
mercy
of
a
rascal
who
put
a
false
gloss
upon
all
his
words
and
addressed
himself
to
the
audience
successively
in
french
high
dutch
italian
and
hungarian
latin
desiring
to
know
if
any
person
present
understood
any
of
these
tongues
that
his
answers
might
be
honestly
explained
to
the
bench
but
he
might
have
accosted
them
in
chinese
with
the
same
success
there
was
not
one
person
present
tolerably
versed
in
his
much
less
acquainted
with
any
foreign
language
except
the
wine
merchant
who
incensed
at
this
appeal
which
he
considered
as
an
affront
to
his
integrity
gave
the
judge
to
understand
that
the
delinquent
instead
of
speaking
to
the
purpose
contumaciously
insulted
his
authority
in
sundry
foreign
lingos
which
he
apprehended
was
an
additional
proof
of
his
being
the
chevalier
son
inasmuch
as
no
person
would
take
the
pains
to
learn
such
a
variety
of
gibberish
except
with
some
sinister
intent
this
annotation
was
not
lost
upon
the
squire
who
was
too
jealous
of
the
honour
of
his
office
to
overlook
such
a
flagrant
instance
of
contempt
his
eyes
glistened
his
cheeks
were
inflated
with
rage
the
case
is
plain
said
he
having
nothing
of
signification
to
offer
in
his
own
favour
he
grows
refractory
and
abuses
the
court
in
his
base
roman
catholic
jargon
but
i
let
you
know
for
all
you
pretend
to
be
a
prince
you
are
no
better
than
an
outlawed
vagrant
and
i
show
you
what
a
thing
you
are
when
you
come
in
composition
with
an
english
justice
like
me
who
have
more
than
once
extinguished
myself
in
the
service
of
my
country
as
nothing
else
accrues
your
purse
black
box
and
papers
shall
be
sealed
up
before
witnesses
and
sent
by
express
to
one
of
his
majesty
secretaries
of
state
and
as
for
yourself
i
will
apply
to
the
military
at
canterbury
for
a
guard
to
conduct
you
to
this
was
a
very
unwelcome
declaration
to
our
adventurer
who
was
on
the
point
of
haranguing
the
justice
and
spectators
in
their
own
language
when
he
was
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
taking
that
step
by
the
interposition
of
a
young
nobleman
just
arrived
at
the
inn
who
being
informed
of
this
strange
examination
entered
the
court
and
at
first
sight
of
the
prisoner
assured
the
justice
he
was
imposed
upon
for
that
he
himself
had
often
seen
the
young
pretender
in
paris
and
that
there
was
no
kind
of
resemblance
between
that
adventurer
and
the
person
now
before
him
the
accuser
was
not
a
little
mortified
at
his
affirmation
which
met
with
all
due
regard
from
the
bench
though
the
magistrate
took
notice
that
granting
the
prisoner
was
not
the
young
chevalier
himself
it
was
highly
probable
he
was
an
emissary
of
that
house
as
he
could
give
no
satisfactory
account
of
himself
and
was
possessed
of
things
of
such
value
as
no
honest
man
could
expose
to
the
accidents
of
the
road
fathom
having
thus
found
an
interpreter
who
signified
to
him
in
the
french
tongue
the
doubts
of
the
justice
told
his
lordship
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
noble
house
in
germany
who
for
certain
reasons
had
come
abroad
incognito
with
a
view
to
see
the
world
and
that
although
the
letters
they
had
seized
would
prove
the
truth
of
that
assertion
he
should
be
loth
to
expose
his
private
concerns
to
the
knowledge
of
strangers
if
he
could
possibly
be
released
without
that
mortification
the
young
nobleman
explained
his
desire
to
the
court
but
his
own
curiosity
being
interested
observed
at
the
same
time
that
the
justice
could
not
be
said
to
have
discharged
the
duties
of
his
station
until
he
should
have
examined
every
circumstance
relating
to
the
prisoner
upon
which
remonstrance
he
was
requested
by
the
bench
to
peruse
the
papers
and
accordingly
communicated
the
substance
of
one
letter
to
this
effect
my
dear
son
though
i
am
far
from
approving
the
rash
step
you
have
taken
in
withdrawing
yourself
from
your
father
house
in
order
to
avoid
an
engagement
which
would
have
been
equally
honourable
and
advantageous
to
your
family
i
can
not
so
far
suppress
my
affection
as
to
bear
the
thought
of
your
undergoing
those
hardships
which
for
your
disobedience
you
deserve
to
suffer
i
have
therefore
without
the
knowledge
of
your
father
sent
the
bearer
to
attend
you
in
your
peregrinations
his
fidelity
you
know
hath
been
tried
in
a
long
course
of
service
and
i
have
entrusted
to
his
care
for
your
use
a
purse
of
two
hundred
ducats
and
a
box
of
jewels
to
the
value
of
twice
that
sum
which
though
not
sufficient
to
support
an
equipage
suitable
to
your
birth
will
at
least
for
some
time
preserve
you
from
the
importunities
of
want
when
you
are
dutiful
enough
to
explain
your
designs
and
situation
you
may
expect
further
indulgence
from
your
tender
and
disconsolate
mother
countess
of
this
letter
which
as
well
as
the
others
our
hero
had
forged
for
the
purpose
effectually
answered
his
intent
in
throwing
dust
in
the
eyes
and
understanding
of
the
spectators
who
now
regarded
the
prisoner
with
looks
of
respectful
remorse
as
a
man
of
quality
who
had
been
falsely
accused
his
lordship
to
make
a
parade
of
his
own
politeness
and
importance
assured
the
bench
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
family
of
the
fathoms
and
with
a
compliment
gave
ferdinand
to
understand
he
had
formerly
seen
him
at
versailles
there
being
no
longer
room
for
suspicion
the
justice
ordered
our
adventurer
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
even
invited
him
to
be
seated
with
an
apology
for
the
rude
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
owing
to
the
misinformation
of
the
accuser
who
was
threatened
with
the
stocks
for
his
malice
and
presumption
but
this
was
not
the
only
triumph
our
hero
obtained
over
the
wine
merchant
maurice
was
no
sooner
unfettered
than
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
room
my
lord
said
he
addressing
himself
in
french
to
his
master
deliverer
since
you
have
been
so
generous
as
to
protect
a
noble
stranger
from
the
danger
of
such
a
false
accusation
i
hope
you
will
still
lay
an
additional
obligation
upon
the
count
by
retorting
the
vengeance
of
the
law
upon
his
perfidious
accuser
whom
i
know
to
be
a
trader
in
those
articles
of
merchandise
which
are
prohibited
by
the
ordinances
of
this
nation
i
have
seen
him
lately
at
boulogne
and
am
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
some
persons
who
have
supplied
him
with
french
lace
and
embroidery
and
as
a
proof
of
what
i
allege
i
desire
you
will
order
him
and
this
barber
who
is
his
understrapper
to
be
examined
on
the
this
charge
which
was
immediately
explained
to
the
bench
yielded
extraordinary
satisfaction
to
the
spectators
one
of
whom
being
an
officer
of
the
customs
forthwith
began
to
exercise
his
function
upon
the
unlucky
perruquier
who
being
stripped
of
his
upper
garments
and
even
of
his
shirt
appeared
like
the
mummy
of
an
egyptian
king
most
curiously
rolled
up
in
bandages
of
rich
figured
gold
shalloon
that
covered
the
skirts
of
four
embroidered
waistcoats
the
merchant
seeing
his
expectation
so
unhappily
reversed
made
an
effort
to
retire
with
a
most
rueful
aspect
but
was
prevented
by
the
officer
who
demanded
the
interposition
of
the
civil
power
that
he
might
undergo
the
same
examination
to
which
the
other
had
been
subjected
he
was
accordingly
rifled
without
loss
of
time
and
the
inquiry
proved
well
worth
the
care
of
him
who
made
it
for
a
considerable
booty
of
the
same
sort
of
merchandise
was
found
in
his
boots
breeches
hat
and
between
the
buckram
and
lining
of
his
surtout
yet
not
contented
with
this
prize
the
experienced
spoiler
proceeded
to
search
his
baggage
and
perceiving
a
false
bottom
in
his
portmanteau
detected
beneath
it
a
valuable
accession
to
the
plunder
he
had
already
obtained
chapter
thirty
the
singular
manner
of
fathom
attack
and
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
the
fair
elenor
proper
cognisance
being
thus
taken
of
these
contraband
effects
and
the
informer
furnished
with
a
certificate
by
which
he
was
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
seizure
the
coachman
summoned
his
passengers
to
the
carriage
the
purse
and
jewels
were
restored
to
count
fathom
who
thanked
the
justice
and
his
lordship
in
particular
for
the
candour
and
hospitality
with
which
he
had
been
treated
and
resumed
his
place
in
the
vehicle
amidst
the
congratulations
of
all
his
except
the
two
forlorn
smugglers
who
instead
of
in
the
coach
thought
proper
to
remain
at
the
inn
with
view
to
mitigate
if
possible
the
severity
of
their
misfortune
among
those
who
felicitated
fathom
upon
the
issue
of
this
adventure
the
young
maiden
seemed
to
express
the
most
sensible
pleasure
at
that
event
the
artful
language
of
his
eyes
had
raised
in
her
breast
certain
fluttering
emotions
before
she
knew
the
value
of
her
conquest
but
now
that
his
rank
and
condition
were
discovered
these
transports
were
increased
by
the
ideas
of
vanity
and
ambition
which
are
mingled
with
the
first
seeds
of
every
female
constitution
the
belief
of
having
captivated
the
heart
of
a
man
who
could
raise
her
to
the
rank
and
dignity
of
a
countess
produced
such
agreeable
sensations
in
her
fancy
that
her
eyes
shone
with
unusual
lustre
and
a
continual
smile
played
in
dimples
on
her
rosy
cheeks
so
that
her
attractions
though
not
powerful
enough
to
engage
the
affection
were
yet
sufficient
to
inflame
the
desire
of
our
adventurer
who
very
honestly
marked
her
chastity
for
prey
to
his
voluptuous
passion
had
she
been
well
seasoned
with
knowledge
and
experience
and
completely
armed
with
caution
against
the
artifice
and
villany
of
man
her
virtue
might
not
have
been
able
to
withstand
the
engines
of
such
an
assailant
considering
the
dangerous
opportunities
to
which
she
was
necessarily
exposed
how
easy
then
must
his
victory
have
been
over
an
innocent
unsuspecting
country
damsel
flushed
with
the
warmth
of
youth
and
an
utter
stranger
to
the
ways
of
life
while
obadiah
therefore
and
his
plump
companion
were
engaged
in
conversation
on
the
strange
incidents
which
had
passed
fathom
acted
a
very
expressive
pantomime
with
this
fair
buxom
nymph
who
comprehended
his
meaning
with
surprising
facility
and
was
at
so
little
pains
to
conceal
the
pleasure
she
took
in
this
kind
of
intercourse
that
several
warm
squeezes
were
interchanged
between
her
and
her
lover
before
they
arrived
at
rochester
where
they
proposed
to
dine
it
was
during
this
period
he
learned
from
the
answers
she
made
to
the
inquisitive
quaker
that
her
sole
dependence
was
upon
a
relation
to
whom
she
had
a
letter
and
that
she
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
great
city
circumstances
on
which
he
soon
formed
the
project
of
her
ruin
upon
their
arrival
at
the
black
bull
he
for
the
first
time
found
himself
alone
with
his
amanda
whose
name
was
elenor
their
being
elsewhere
employed
about
their
own
concerns
and
unwilling
to
lose
the
precious
opportunity
he
began
to
act
the
part
of
a
very
importunate
lover
which
he
conceived
to
be
a
proper
sequel
to
the
prelude
which
had
been
performed
in
the
coach
the
freedoms
which
she
out
of
pure
simplicity
and
permitted
him
to
take
with
her
hand
and
even
her
rosy
lips
encouraged
him
to
practise
other
familiarities
upon
her
fair
bosom
which
scandalised
her
virtue
so
much
that
in
spite
of
the
passion
she
had
begun
to
indulge
in
his
behalf
she
rejected
his
advances
with
all
the
marks
of
anger
and
disdain
and
he
found
it
necessary
to
appease
the
storm
he
had
raised
by
the
most
respectful
and
submissive
demeanour
resolving
to
change
his
operations
and
carry
on
his
attacks
so
as
to
make
her
yield
at
discretion
without
alarming
her
religion
or
pride
accordingly
when
the
bill
was
called
after
dinner
he
took
particular
notice
of
her
behaviour
and
perceiving
her
pull
out
a
large
leathern
purse
that
contained
her
money
reconnoitred
the
pocket
in
which
it
was
deposited
and
while
they
sat
close
to
each
other
in
the
carriage
conveyed
it
with
admirable
dexterity
into
an
hole
in
the
cushion
whether
the
corpulent
couple
who
sat
opposite
to
these
lovers
had
entered
into
an
amorous
engagement
at
the
inn
or
were
severally
induced
by
other
motives
is
uncertain
but
sure
it
is
both
left
the
coach
on
that
part
of
the
road
which
lies
nearest
to
gravesend
and
bade
adieu
to
the
other
pair
on
pretence
of
having
urgent
business
at
that
place
ferdinand
not
a
little
pleased
at
their
departure
renewed
his
most
pathetic
expressions
of
love
and
sung
several
french
songs
on
that
tender
subject
which
seemed
to
thrill
to
the
soul
of
his
beauteous
helen
while
the
driver
halted
at
dartford
to
water
his
horses
she
was
smit
with
the
appearance
of
some
cheesecakes
which
were
presented
by
the
landlady
of
the
house
and
having
bargained
for
two
or
three
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
in
order
to
pay
for
her
purchase
but
what
was
her
astonishment
when
after
having
rummaged
her
equipage
she
understood
her
whole
fortune
was
lost
this
mishap
was
by
a
loud
shriek
announced
to
our
hero
who
affected
infinite
amazement
and
concern
and
no
sooner
learned
the
cause
of
her
affliction
than
he
presented
her
with
his
own
purse
from
which
he
in
emphatic
dumb
show
begged
she
would
indemnify
herself
for
the
damage
she
had
sustained
although
this
kind
proffer
was
some
alleviation
of
her
misfortunes
she
did
not
fail
to
pour
forth
a
most
piteous
lamentation
importing
that
she
had
not
only
lost
all
her
money
amounting
to
five
pounds
but
also
her
letter
of
recommendation
upon
which
she
had
altogether
relied
for
present
employment
the
vehicle
was
minutely
searched
from
top
to
bottom
by
herself
and
our
adventurer
assisted
by
maurice
and
the
coachman
who
finding
their
inquiry
ineffectual
did
not
scruple
to
declare
his
suspicion
of
the
two
fat
turtles
who
had
deserted
the
coach
in
such
an
abrupt
manner
in
a
word
he
rendered
this
conjecture
so
plausible
by
wresting
the
circumstances
of
their
behaviour
and
retreat
that
poor
elenor
implicitly
believed
they
were
the
thieves
by
whom
she
had
suffered
and
was
prevailed
upon
to
accept
the
proffered
assistance
of
the
generous
count
who
seeing
her
very
much
disordered
by
this
mischance
insisted
upon
her
drinking
a
large
glass
of
canary
to
quiet
the
perturbation
of
her
spirits
this
is
a
season
which
of
all
others
is
most
propitious
to
the
attempts
of
an
artful
lover
and
justifies
the
metaphorical
maxim
of
fishing
in
troubled
waters
there
is
an
affinity
and
short
transition
betwixt
all
the
violent
passions
that
agitate
the
human
mind
they
are
all
false
perspectives
which
though
they
magnify
yet
perplex
and
render
indistinct
every
object
which
they
represent
and
flattery
is
never
so
successfully
administered
as
to
those
who
know
they
stand
in
need
of
friendship
assent
and
approbation
the
cordial
she
swallowed
far
from
calming
increased
the
disturbance
of
her
thoughts
and
produced
an
intoxication
during
which
she
talked
in
an
incoherent
strain
laughed
and
wept
by
turns
and
acted
other
extravagances
which
are
known
to
be
symptoms
of
the
hysterical
affection
fathom
though
an
utter
stranger
to
the
sentiments
of
honour
pity
and
remorse
would
not
perpetrate
his
vicious
purpose
though
favoured
by
the
delirium
his
villany
had
entailed
upon
this
unfortunate
young
maiden
because
his
appetite
demanded
a
more
perfect
sacrifice
than
that
which
she
could
yield
in
her
present
deplorable
situation
when
her
will
must
have
been
altogether
unconcerned
in
his
success
determined
therefore
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
before
he
would
take
possession
of
her
person
he
mimicked
that
compassion
and
benevolence
which
his
heart
had
never
felt
and
when
the
coach
arrived
at
london
not
only
discharged
what
she
owed
for
her
place
but
likewise
procured
for
her
an
apartment
in
the
house
to
which
he
himself
had
been
directed
for
lodgings
and
even
hired
a
nurse
to
attend
her
during
a
severe
fever
which
was
the
consequence
of
her
disappointment
and
despondence
indeed
she
was
supplied
with
all
necessaries
by
the
generosity
of
this
noble
count
who
for
the
interest
of
his
passion
and
the
honour
of
his
name
was
resolved
to
extend
his
charity
to
the
last
farthing
of
her
own
money
which
he
had
been
wise
enough
to
secure
for
this
purpose
her
youth
soon
got
the
better
of
her
distemper
and
when
she
understood
her
obligations
to
the
count
who
did
not
fail
to
attend
her
in
person
with
great
tenderness
her
heart
which
had
been
before
prepossessed
in
his
favour
now
glowed
with
all
the
warmth
of
gratitude
esteem
and
affection
she
knew
herself
in
a
strange
place
destitute
of
all
resource
but
in
his
generosity
she
loved
his
person
she
was
dazzled
by
his
rank
and
he
knew
so
well
how
to
improve
the
opportunities
and
advantages
he
derived
from
her
unhappy
situation
that
he
gradually
proceeded
in
sapping
from
one
degree
of
intimacy
to
another
until
all
the
bulwarks
of
her
chastity
were
undermined
and
she
submitted
to
his
desire
not
with
the
reluctance
of
a
vanquished
people
but
with
all
the
transports
of
a
joyful
city
that
opens
its
gates
to
receive
a
darling
prince
returned
from
conquest
for
by
this
time
he
had
artfully
concentred
and
kindled
up
all
the
inflammable
ingredients
of
her
constitution
and
she
now
looked
back
upon
the
virtuous
principles
of
her
education
as
upon
a
disagreeable
and
tedious
dream
from
which
she
had
waked
to
the
fruition
of
joy
chapter
he
by
accident
encounters
his
old
friend
with
whom
he
holds
a
conference
and
renews
a
treaty
our
hero
having
thus
provided
himself
with
a
proper
subject
for
his
hours
of
dalliance
thought
it
was
now
high
time
to
study
the
ground
which
he
had
pitched
upon
for
the
scene
of
his
exploits
and
with
that
view
made
several
excursions
to
different
parts
of
the
town
where
there
was
aught
of
entertainment
or
instruction
to
be
found
yet
he
always
on
these
occasions
appeared
in
an
obscure
ordinary
dress
in
order
to
avoid
singularity
and
never
went
twice
to
the
same
that
his
person
might
not
be
afterwards
known
in
case
he
should
shine
forth
to
the
public
in
a
superior
sphere
on
his
return
from
one
of
those
expeditions
while
he
was
passing
through
ludgate
his
eyes
were
suddenly
encountered
by
the
apparition
of
his
old
friend
the
tyrolese
who
perceiving
himself
fairly
caught
in
the
toil
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
running
up
to
our
adventurer
with
an
aspect
of
eagerness
and
joy
clasped
him
in
his
arms
as
some
dear
friend
whom
he
had
casually
found
after
a
most
tedious
and
disagreeable
separation
fathom
whose
genius
never
failed
him
in
such
emergencies
far
from
receiving
these
advances
with
the
threats
and
reproaches
which
the
other
had
deserved
at
his
hands
returned
the
salute
with
equal
warmth
and
was
really
overjoyed
at
meeting
with
a
person
who
might
one
way
or
other
make
amends
for
the
perfidy
of
his
former
conduct
the
tyrolese
whose
name
was
ratchcali
pleased
with
his
reception
proposed
they
should
adjourn
to
the
next
tavern
in
which
they
had
no
sooner
taken
possession
of
an
apartment
than
he
addressed
himself
to
his
old
companion
in
these
words
mr
fathom
by
your
frank
and
obliging
manner
of
treating
a
man
who
hath
done
you
wrong
i
am
more
and
more
confirmed
in
my
opinion
of
your
sagacity
which
i
have
often
considered
with
admiration
i
will
not
therefore
attempt
to
make
an
apology
for
my
conduct
at
our
last
parting
but
only
assure
you
that
this
meeting
may
turn
out
to
our
mutual
advantage
if
we
now
into
an
unreserved
union
the
ties
of
which
we
will
soon
find
it
our
interest
and
inclination
to
preserve
for
my
own
part
as
my
judgment
is
ripened
by
experience
so
are
my
sentiments
changed
since
our
last
association
i
have
seen
many
a
rich
harvest
lost
for
want
of
a
in
the
vineyard
and
i
have
more
than
once
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
a
combination
which
i
could
have
resisted
with
the
help
of
one
able
auxiliary
indeed
i
might
prove
what
i
allege
by
mathematical
demonstration
and
i
believe
nobody
will
pretend
to
deny
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
in
all
cases
that
require
discernment
and
ferdinand
could
not
help
owning
the
sanity
of
his
observations
and
forthwith
acquiesced
in
his
proposal
of
the
new
alliance
desiring
to
know
the
character
in
which
he
acted
on
the
english
stage
and
the
scheme
he
would
offer
for
their
mutual
emolument
at
the
same
time
he
resolved
within
himself
to
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
his
future
actions
as
would
frustrate
any
design
he
might
hereafter
harbour
of
repeating
the
prank
he
had
so
successfully
played
upon
him
in
their
journey
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
having
quitted
you
at
resumed
the
tyrolese
i
travelled
without
ceasing
until
i
arrived
at
frankfort
upon
the
maine
where
i
assumed
the
character
of
a
french
chevalier
and
struck
some
masterly
strokes
which
you
yourself
would
not
have
deemed
unworthy
of
your
invention
and
my
success
was
the
more
agreeable
as
my
operations
were
chiefly
carried
on
against
the
enemies
of
our
religion
but
my
prosperity
was
not
of
long
duration
seeing
they
could
not
foil
me
at
my
own
weapons
they
formed
a
damned
conspiracy
by
which
i
not
only
lost
all
the
fruits
of
my
industry
but
likewise
ran
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
my
life
i
had
ordered
some
of
those
jewels
which
i
had
borrowed
of
my
good
friend
fathom
to
be
new
set
in
a
fashionable
taste
and
soon
after
had
an
opportunity
to
sell
one
of
these
at
a
great
advantage
to
one
of
the
fraternity
who
offered
an
extraordinary
price
for
the
stone
on
purpose
to
effect
my
ruin
in
less
than
hours
after
this
bargain
i
was
arrested
by
the
officers
of
justice
upon
the
oath
of
the
purchaser
who
undertook
to
prove
me
guilty
of
a
fraud
in
selling
a
saxon
pebble
for
a
real
diamond
and
this
accusation
was
actually
true
for
the
change
had
been
artfully
put
upon
me
by
the
jeweller
who
was
himself
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
had
my
conscience
been
clear
of
any
other
impeachment
perhaps
i
should
have
rested
my
cause
upon
the
equity
and
protection
of
the
law
but
i
foresaw
that
the
trial
would
introduce
an
inquiry
to
which
i
was
not
at
all
ambitious
of
submitting
and
therefore
was
fain
to
compromise
the
affair
at
the
price
of
almost
my
whole
fortune
yet
this
accommodation
was
not
made
so
secretly
but
that
my
character
was
blasted
and
my
credit
overthrown
so
that
i
was
fain
to
relinquish
my
occasional
equipage
and
hire
myself
as
journeyman
to
a
lapidary
an
employment
which
i
had
exercised
in
my
youth
in
this
obscure
station
i
laboured
with
great
assiduity
until
i
made
myself
perfect
in
the
knowledge
of
stones
as
well
as
in
the
different
methods
of
setting
them
off
to
the
best
advantage
and
having
by
dint
of
industry
and
address
got
possession
of
a
small
parcel
set
out
for
this
kingdom
in
which
i
happily
arrived
about
four
months
ago
and
surely
england
is
the
paradise
of
artists
of
our
profession
one
would
imagine
that
nature
had
created
the
inhabitants
for
the
support
and
enjoyment
of
adventurers
like
you
and
me
not
that
these
islanders
open
the
arms
of
hospitality
to
all
foreigners
without
distinction
on
the
contrary
they
inherit
from
their
fathers
an
unreasonable
prejudice
against
all
nations
under
the
sun
and
when
an
englishman
happens
to
quarrel
with
a
stranger
the
first
term
of
reproach
he
uses
is
the
name
of
his
antagonist
country
characterised
by
some
opprobrious
epithet
such
as
a
chattering
frenchman
an
italian
ape
a
german
hog
and
a
beastly
dutchman
nay
their
national
prepossession
is
maintained
even
against
those
people
with
whom
they
are
united
under
the
same
laws
and
government
for
nothing
is
more
common
than
to
hear
them
exclaim
against
their
in
the
expressions
of
a
beggarly
scot
and
an
impudent
irish
yet
this
very
prejudice
will
never
fail
to
turn
to
the
account
of
every
stranger
possessed
of
ordinary
talents
for
he
will
always
find
opportunities
of
conversing
with
them
in
and
places
of
public
resort
in
spite
of
their
professed
reserve
which
by
the
bye
is
so
extraordinary
that
i
know
some
people
who
have
lived
twenty
years
in
the
same
house
without
exchanging
one
word
with
their
neighbours
yet
provided
he
can
talk
sensibly
and
preserve
the
deportment
of
a
sober
gentleman
in
those
occasional
conversations
his
behaviour
will
be
the
more
remarkably
pleasing
as
it
will
agreeably
disappoint
the
expectation
of
the
person
who
had
entertained
notions
to
his
prejudice
when
a
foreigner
has
once
crossed
this
bar
which
perpetually
occurs
he
sails
without
further
difficulty
into
the
harbour
of
an
englishman
goodwill
for
the
pique
is
neither
personal
nor
rancorous
but
rather
contemptuous
and
national
so
that
while
he
despises
a
people
in
the
lump
an
individual
of
that
very
community
may
be
one
of
his
chief
favourites
the
english
are
in
general
upright
and
honest
therefore
unsuspecting
and
credulous
they
are
too
much
engrossed
with
their
own
business
to
pry
into
the
conduct
of
their
neighbours
and
too
indifferent
in
point
of
disposition
to
interest
themselves
in
what
they
conceive
to
be
foreign
to
their
own
concerns
they
are
wealthy
and
mercantile
of
consequence
liberal
and
adventurous
and
so
well
disposed
to
take
a
own
word
for
his
importance
that
they
suffer
themselves
to
be
preyed
upon
by
such
a
bungling
set
of
impostors
as
would
starve
for
lack
of
address
in
any
other
country
under
the
sun
this
being
a
true
sketch
of
the
british
character
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
and
learn
you
will
easily
comprehend
the
profits
that
may
be
extracted
from
it
by
virtue
of
those
arts
by
which
you
so
eminently
excel
the
great
the
unbounded
prospect
lies
before
me
indeed
i
look
upon
this
opulent
kingdom
as
a
wide
and
fertile
common
on
which
we
adventurers
may
range
for
prey
without
let
or
molestation
for
so
jealous
are
the
natives
of
their
liberties
that
they
will
not
bear
the
restraint
of
necessary
police
and
an
able
artist
may
enrich
himself
with
their
spoils
without
running
any
risk
of
attracting
the
magistrate
or
incurring
the
least
penalty
of
the
law
in
a
word
this
metropolis
is
a
vast
masquerade
in
which
a
man
of
stratagem
may
wear
a
thousand
different
disguises
without
danger
of
detection
there
is
a
variety
of
shapes
in
which
we
the
knights
of
industry
make
our
appearance
in
london
one
glides
into
a
house
in
the
capacity
of
a
and
in
a
few
months
leads
the
whole
family
by
the
nose
another
exhibits
himself
to
the
public
as
an
empiric
or
operator
for
the
teeth
and
by
dint
of
assurance
and
affidavits
bearing
testimony
to
wonderful
cures
that
never
were
performed
whirls
himself
into
his
chariot
and
lays
the
town
under
contribution
a
third
professes
the
composition
of
music
as
well
as
the
performance
and
by
means
of
a
few
capriciosos
on
the
violin
properly
introduced
wriggles
himself
into
the
management
of
private
and
public
concerts
and
a
fourth
breaks
forth
at
once
in
all
the
splendour
of
a
gay
equipage
under
the
title
and
denomination
of
a
foreign
count
not
to
mention
those
inferior
projectors
who
assume
the
characters
of
dancers
and
french
ushers
or
by
renouncing
their
religion
seek
to
obtain
a
provision
for
life
either
of
these
parts
will
turn
to
the
account
of
an
able
actor
and
as
you
are
equally
qualified
for
all
you
may
choose
that
which
is
most
suitable
to
your
own
inclination
though
in
my
opinion
you
was
designed
by
nature
to
shine
in
the
great
world
which
after
all
is
the
most
ample
field
for
men
of
genius
because
the
game
is
deeper
and
people
of
fashion
being
for
the
most
part
more
ignorant
indolent
vain
and
capricious
than
their
inferiors
are
of
consequence
more
easily
deceived
besides
their
morals
sit
generally
so
loose
about
them
that
when
a
gentleman
of
our
fraternity
is
discovered
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
their
contempt
of
his
skill
is
the
only
disgrace
he
our
hero
was
so
well
pleased
with
this
picture
that
he
longed
to
peruse
the
original
and
before
these
two
friends
parted
they
settled
all
the
operations
of
the
campaign
ratchcali
that
same
evening
hired
magnificent
lodgings
for
count
fathom
in
the
court
end
of
the
town
and
furnished
his
wardrobe
and
liveries
from
the
spoils
of
monmouth
street
he
likewise
enlisted
another
footman
and
into
his
service
and
sent
to
the
apartments
divers
large
trunks
supposed
to
be
filled
with
the
baggage
of
this
foreign
nobleman
though
in
reality
they
contained
little
else
than
common
lumber
next
day
our
adventurer
took
possession
of
his
new
habitation
after
having
left
to
his
friend
and
associate
the
task
of
dismissing
the
unfortunate
elenor
who
was
so
shocked
at
the
unexpected
message
that
she
fainted
away
and
when
she
recovered
the
use
of
her
senses
so
well
as
to
reflect
upon
her
forlorn
condition
she
was
seized
with
the
most
violent
transports
of
grief
and
dismay
by
which
her
brain
was
disordered
to
such
a
degree
that
she
grew
furious
and
distracted
and
was
by
the
advice
and
assistance
of
the
tyrolese
conveyed
into
the
hospital
of
bethlem
where
we
shall
leave
her
for
the
present
happily
bereft
of
her
reason
chapter
he
appears
in
the
great
world
with
universal
applause
and
admiration
meanwhile
fathom
and
his
engine
were
busied
in
completing
his
equipage
so
that
in
a
few
days
he
had
procured
a
very
gay
chariot
adorned
with
painting
gilding
and
a
coat
of
arms
according
to
his
own
fancy
and
direction
the
first
use
he
made
of
this
vehicle
was
that
of
visiting
the
young
nobleman
from
whom
he
had
received
such
important
civilities
on
the
road
in
consequence
of
an
invitation
at
parting
by
which
he
learned
his
title
and
the
place
of
his
abode
in
london
his
lordship
was
not
only
pleased
but
proud
to
see
such
a
stranger
at
his
gate
and
entertained
him
with
excess
of
complaisance
and
hospitality
insomuch
that
by
his
means
our
hero
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
whole
circle
of
polite
company
by
whom
he
was
caressed
for
his
insinuating
manners
and
agreeable
conversation
he
had
thought
proper
to
tell
the
nobleman
at
their
first
interview
in
town
that
his
reasons
for
concealing
his
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
were
now
removed
and
that
he
would
no
longer
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
speaking
a
language
which
had
been
always
music
to
his
ear
he
had
also
thanked
his
lordship
for
his
generous
interposition
at
the
inn
which
was
an
instance
of
that
generosity
and
true
politeness
which
are
engrossed
by
the
english
people
who
leave
nought
to
other
nations
but
the
mere
shadow
of
these
virtues
a
testimony
like
this
from
the
mouth
of
such
a
noble
stranger
won
the
heart
of
the
peer
who
professed
a
friendship
for
him
on
the
spot
and
undertook
to
see
justice
done
to
his
lacquey
who
in
a
short
time
was
gratified
with
a
share
of
the
seizure
which
had
been
made
upon
his
information
amounting
to
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
ferdinand
put
not
forth
the
whole
strength
of
his
accomplishments
at
once
but
contrived
to
spring
a
new
mine
of
qualification
every
day
to
the
surprise
and
admiration
of
all
his
acquaintance
he
was
gifted
with
a
sort
of
elocution
much
more
specious
than
solid
and
spoke
on
every
subject
that
occurred
in
conversation
with
that
familiarity
and
ease
which
one
would
think
could
only
be
acquired
by
long
study
and
application
this
plausibility
and
confidence
are
faculties
really
inherited
from
nature
and
effectually
serve
the
possessor
in
lieu
of
that
learning
which
is
not
to
be
obtained
without
infinite
toil
and
perseverance
the
most
superficial
tincture
of
the
arts
and
sciences
in
such
a
juggler
is
sufficient
to
dazzle
the
understanding
of
half
mankind
and
if
managed
with
circumspection
will
enable
him
even
to
spend
his
life
among
the
literati
without
once
forfeiting
the
character
of
a
connoisseur
our
hero
was
perfectly
master
of
this
legerdemain
which
he
carried
to
such
a
pitch
of
assurance
as
to
declare
in
the
midst
of
a
mathematical
assembly
that
he
intended
to
gratify
the
public
with
a
full
confutation
of
sir
isaac
newton
philosophy
to
the
nature
of
which
he
was
as
much
a
stranger
as
the
most
savage
hottentot
in
africa
his
pretensions
to
profound
and
universal
knowledge
were
supported
not
only
by
this
kind
of
presumption
but
also
by
the
facility
with
which
he
spoke
so
many
different
languages
and
the
shrewd
remarks
he
had
made
in
the
course
of
his
travels
and
observation
among
politicians
he
settled
the
balance
of
power
upon
a
certain
footing
by
dint
of
ingenious
schemes
which
he
had
contrived
for
the
welfare
of
europe
with
officers
he
reformed
the
art
of
war
with
improvements
which
had
occurred
to
his
reflection
while
he
was
engaged
in
a
military
life
he
sometimes
held
forth
upon
painting
like
a
member
of
the
dilettanti
club
the
theory
of
music
was
a
theme
upon
which
he
seemed
to
expatiate
with
particular
pleasure
in
the
provinces
of
love
and
gallantry
he
was
a
perfect
oroondates
he
possessed
a
most
agreeable
manner
of
telling
entertaining
stories
of
which
he
had
a
large
collection
he
sung
with
great
melody
and
taste
and
played
upon
the
violin
with
surprising
execution
to
these
qualifications
let
us
add
his
affability
and
pliant
disposition
and
then
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
pattern
of
human
perfection
and
his
acquaintance
courted
accordingly
while
he
thus
captivated
the
favour
and
affection
of
the
english
nobility
he
did
not
neglect
to
take
other
measures
in
behalf
of
the
partnership
to
which
he
had
subscribed
the
adventure
with
the
two
squires
at
paris
had
weakened
his
appetite
for
play
which
was
not
at
all
restored
by
the
observations
he
had
made
in
london
where
the
art
of
gaming
is
reduced
into
a
regular
system
and
its
professors
so
laudably
devoted
to
the
discharge
of
their
functions
as
to
observe
the
most
temperate
regimen
lest
their
invention
should
be
impaired
by
the
fatigue
of
watching
or
exercise
and
their
ideas
disturbed
by
the
fumes
of
indigestion
no
indian
brachman
could
live
more
abstemious
than
two
of
the
pack
who
hunted
in
couple
and
kennelled
in
the
upper
apartments
of
the
hotel
in
which
our
adventurer
lived
they
abstained
from
animal
food
with
the
abhorrence
of
pythagoreans
their
drink
was
a
pure
simple
element
they
were
vomited
once
a
week
took
physic
or
a
glyster
every
third
day
spent
the
forenoon
in
algebraical
calculations
and
slept
from
four
till
midnight
that
they
might
then
take
the
field
with
that
cool
serenity
which
is
the
effect
of
refreshment
and
repose
these
were
terms
upon
which
our
hero
would
not
risk
his
fortune
he
was
too
much
addicted
to
pleasure
to
forego
every
other
enjoyment
but
that
of
amassing
and
did
not
so
much
depend
upon
his
dexterity
in
play
as
upon
his
talent
of
insinuation
which
by
this
time
had
succeeded
so
far
beyond
his
expectation
that
he
began
to
indulge
the
hope
of
enslaving
the
heart
of
some
rich
heiress
whose
fortune
would
at
once
raise
him
above
all
dependence
indeed
no
man
ever
set
out
with
a
fairer
prospect
on
such
an
expedition
for
he
had
found
means
to
render
himself
so
agreeable
to
the
fair
sex
that
like
the
boxes
of
the
playhouse
during
the
representation
of
a
new
performance
his
company
was
often
bespoke
for
a
series
of
weeks
and
no
lady
whether
widow
wife
or
maiden
ever
mentioned
his
name
without
some
epithet
of
esteem
or
affection
such
as
the
dear
count
the
charming
man
the
nonpareil
or
the
angel
while
he
thus
shone
in
the
zenith
of
admiration
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
he
could
have
melted
some
wealthy
dowager
or
opulent
ward
but
being
an
enemy
to
all
precipitate
engagements
he
resolved
to
act
with
great
care
and
deliberation
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
especially
as
he
did
not
find
himself
hurried
by
the
importunities
of
want
for
since
his
arrival
in
england
he
had
rather
increased
than
exhausted
his
finances
by
methods
equally
certain
and
secure
in
a
word
he
with
the
assistance
of
ratchcali
carried
on
a
traffic
which
yielded
great
profits
without
subjecting
the
trader
to
the
least
loss
or
inconvenience
fathom
for
example
wore
upon
his
finger
a
large
brilliant
which
he
played
to
such
advantage
one
night
at
a
certain
nobleman
house
where
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
solo
on
the
violin
that
everybody
present
took
notice
of
its
uncommon
lustre
and
it
was
handed
about
for
the
perusal
of
every
individual
the
water
and
the
workmanship
were
universally
admired
and
one
among
the
rest
having
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
the
value
of
such
a
jewel
the
count
seized
that
opportunity
of
entertaining
them
with
a
learned
disquisition
into
the
nature
of
stones
this
introduced
the
history
of
the
diamond
in
question
which
he
said
had
been
purchased
of
an
indian
trader
of
fort
george
at
an
under
price
so
that
the
present
proprietor
could
afford
to
sell
it
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
and
concluded
with
telling
the
company
that
for
his
own
part
he
had
been
importuned
to
wear
it
by
the
jeweller
who
imagined
it
would
have
a
better
chance
for
attracting
a
purchaser
on
his
finger
than
while
it
remained
in
his
own
custody
this
declaration
was
no
sooner
made
than
a
certain
lady
of
quality
bespoke
the
refuse
of
the
jewel
and
desired
ferdinand
to
send
the
owner
next
day
to
her
house
where
he
accordingly
waited
upon
her
ladyship
with
the
ring
for
which
he
received
one
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
of
the
sum
being
clear
gain
and
equally
divided
betwixt
the
associates
nor
was
this
bargain
such
as
reflected
dishonour
upon
the
lady
taste
or
could
be
productive
of
ill
consequences
to
the
merchant
for
the
method
of
estimating
diamonds
is
altogether
arbitrary
and
ratchcali
who
was
an
exquisite
lapidary
had
set
it
in
such
a
manner
as
would
have
imposed
upon
any
ordinary
jeweller
by
these
means
of
introduction
the
tyrolese
soon
monopolised
the
custom
of
a
great
many
noble
families
upon
which
he
levied
large
contributions
without
incurring
the
least
suspicion
of
deceit
he
every
day
out
of
pure
esteem
and
gratitude
for
the
honour
of
their
commands
entertained
them
with
the
sight
of
some
new
trinket
which
he
was
never
permitted
to
carry
home
unsold
and
from
the
profits
of
each
job
a
tax
was
raised
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
yet
his
indultos
were
not
confined
to
the
article
of
jewels
which
constituted
only
one
part
of
his
revenue
by
the
industry
of
his
understrapper
he
procured
a
number
of
old
crazy
fiddles
which
were
thrown
aside
as
lumber
upon
which
he
counterfeited
the
cremona
mark
and
otherwise
cooked
them
up
with
great
dexterity
so
that
when
he
had
occasion
to
regale
the
lovers
of
music
he
would
send
for
one
of
these
vamped
instruments
and
extract
from
it
such
tones
as
quite
ravished
the
hearers
among
whom
there
was
always
some
conceited
pretender
who
spoke
in
raptures
of
the
violin
and
gave
our
hero
an
opportunity
of
launching
out
in
its
praise
and
declaring
it
was
the
best
cremona
he
had
ever
touched
this
encomium
never
failed
to
inflame
the
desires
of
the
audience
to
some
one
of
whom
he
was
generous
enough
to
part
with
it
at
prime
cost
that
is
for
twenty
or
thirty
guineas
clear
profit
for
he
was
often
able
to
oblige
his
friends
in
this
manner
because
being
an
eminent
connoisseur
his
countenance
was
solicited
by
all
the
musicians
who
wanted
to
dispose
of
such
moveables
nor
did
he
neglect
the
other
resources
of
a
skilful
virtuoso
every
auction
afforded
some
picture
in
which
though
it
had
been
overlooked
by
the
ignorance
of
the
times
he
recognised
the
style
of
a
great
master
and
made
a
merit
of
recommending
it
to
some
noble
friend
this
commerce
he
likewise
extended
to
medals
bronzes
busts
intaglios
and
old
china
and
kept
divers
artificers
continually
employed
in
making
antiques
for
the
english
nobility
thus
he
went
on
with
such
rapidity
of
success
in
all
his
endeavours
that
he
himself
was
astonished
at
the
infatuation
he
had
produced
nothing
was
so
wretched
among
the
productions
of
art
that
he
could
not
impose
upon
the
world
as
a
capital
performance
and
so
fascinated
were
the
eyes
of
his
admirers
he
could
easily
have
persuaded
them
that
a
barber
bason
was
an
etrurian
patera
and
the
cover
of
a
copper
pot
no
other
than
the
shield
of
ancus
martius
in
short
it
was
become
so
fashionable
to
consult
the
count
in
everything
relating
to
taste
and
politeness
that
not
a
plan
was
drawn
not
even
a
house
furnished
without
his
advice
and
approbation
nay
to
such
a
degree
did
his
reputation
in
these
matters
excel
that
a
particular
pattern
of
was
known
by
the
name
of
fathom
and
his
hall
was
every
morning
crowded
with
upholsterers
and
other
tradesmen
who
came
by
order
of
their
employers
to
learn
his
choice
and
take
his
directions
the
character
and
influence
he
thus
acquired
he
took
care
to
maintain
with
the
utmost
assiduity
and
circumspection
he
never
failed
to
appear
the
chief
personage
at
all
public
diversions
and
private
assemblies
not
only
in
conversation
and
dress
but
also
in
the
article
of
dancing
in
which
he
outstripped
all
his
fellows
as
far
as
in
every
other
genteel
accomplishment
chapter
he
attracts
the
envy
and
ill
offices
of
the
minor
knights
of
his
own
order
over
whom
he
obtains
a
complete
victory
such
a
could
not
be
enjoyed
without
exciting
the
malevolence
of
envy
and
detraction
in
the
propagation
of
which
none
were
so
industrious
as
the
brethren
of
his
own
order
who
had
like
him
made
a
descent
upon
this
island
and
could
not
without
repining
see
the
whole
harvest
in
the
hands
of
one
man
who
with
equal
art
and
discretion
avoided
all
intercourse
with
their
society
in
vain
they
strove
to
discover
his
pedigree
and
detect
the
particular
circumstances
of
his
life
and
conversation
all
their
inquiries
were
baffled
by
the
obscurity
of
his
origin
and
that
solitary
scheme
which
he
had
adopted
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
the
whole
fruit
of
their
investigation
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
certainty
that
there
was
no
family
of
any
consideration
in
europe
known
by
the
denomination
of
fathom
and
this
discovery
they
did
not
fail
to
divulge
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
who
had
by
this
time
taken
such
firm
root
in
the
favour
of
the
great
as
to
set
all
those
little
arts
at
defiance
and
when
the
report
reached
his
ear
actually
made
his
friends
merry
with
the
conjectures
which
had
been
circulated
at
his
expense
his
adversaries
finding
themselves
disappointed
in
this
effort
held
a
consultation
to
devise
other
measures
against
him
and
came
to
a
resolution
of
ending
him
by
the
sword
or
rather
of
expelling
him
from
the
kingdom
by
the
fear
of
death
which
they
hoped
he
had
not
courage
enough
to
resist
because
his
deportment
had
always
been
remarkably
mild
and
pacific
it
was
upon
this
supposition
that
they
left
to
the
determination
of
the
dice
the
choice
of
the
person
who
should
execute
their
plan
and
the
lot
falling
upon
a
swiss
who
from
the
station
of
a
foot
soldier
in
the
dutch
service
out
of
which
he
had
been
drummed
for
theft
had
erected
himself
into
the
rank
of
a
chevalier
this
hero
fortified
himself
with
a
double
dose
of
brandy
and
betook
himself
to
a
certain
noted
with
an
intent
to
affront
count
fathom
in
public
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
our
adventurer
sitting
at
a
table
in
conversation
with
some
persons
of
the
first
rank
upon
which
he
seated
himself
in
the
next
box
and
after
having
intruded
himself
into
their
discourse
which
happened
to
turn
upon
the
politics
of
some
german
courts
count
said
he
to
ferdinand
in
a
very
abrupt
and
disagreeable
manner
of
address
i
was
last
night
in
company
with
some
gentlemen
among
whom
a
dispute
happened
about
the
place
of
your
nativity
pray
what
country
are
you
of
sir
answered
the
other
with
great
politeness
i
at
present
have
the
honour
to
be
of
oho
replied
the
chevalier
i
ask
your
pardon
that
is
to
say
you
are
incog
some
people
may
find
it
convenient
to
keep
themselves
in
that
true
said
the
count
but
some
people
are
too
well
known
to
enjoy
that
the
swiss
being
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
repartee
which
extracted
a
smile
from
the
audience
after
some
pause
observed
that
persons
of
a
certain
class
had
good
reason
to
drop
the
remembrance
of
what
they
have
been
but
a
good
citizen
will
not
forget
his
country
or
former
condition
and
a
bad
citizen
said
fathom
can
not
if
he
would
provided
he
has
met
with
his
deserts
a
sharper
may
as
well
forget
the
shape
of
a
die
or
a
discarded
soldier
the
sound
of
a
as
the
chevalier
character
and
story
were
not
unknown
this
application
raised
an
universal
laugh
at
his
expense
which
provoked
him
to
such
a
degree
that
starting
up
he
swore
fathom
could
not
have
mentioned
any
object
in
nature
that
he
himself
resembled
so
much
as
a
drum
which
was
exactly
typified
by
his
emptiness
and
sound
with
this
difference
however
that
a
drum
was
never
noisy
till
beaten
whereas
the
count
would
never
be
quiet
until
he
should
have
undergone
the
same
discipline
so
saying
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
with
a
menacing
look
and
walked
out
as
if
in
expectation
of
being
followed
by
our
adventurer
who
suffered
himself
to
be
detained
by
the
company
and
very
calmly
took
notice
that
his
antagonist
would
not
be
ill
pleased
at
their
interposition
perhaps
he
would
not
have
comported
himself
with
such
ease
and
deliberation
had
not
he
made
such
remarks
upon
the
disposition
of
the
chevalier
as
convinced
him
of
his
own
safety
he
had
perceived
a
perplexity
and
perturbation
in
the
countenance
of
the
swiss
when
he
first
entered
the
his
blunt
and
precipitate
way
of
accosting
him
seemed
to
denote
confusion
and
compulsion
and
in
the
midst
of
his
ferocity
this
accurate
observer
discerned
the
trepidation
of
fear
by
the
help
of
these
signs
his
sagacity
soon
comprehended
the
nature
of
his
schemes
and
prepared
accordingly
for
a
formal
defiance
his
conjecture
was
verified
next
morning
by
a
visit
from
the
chevalier
who
taking
it
for
granted
that
fathom
would
not
face
an
adversary
in
the
field
because
he
had
not
followed
him
from
the
went
to
his
lodgings
with
great
confidence
and
demanded
to
see
the
count
upon
an
affair
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
maurice
according
to
his
instructions
told
him
that
his
master
was
gone
out
but
desired
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
repose
himself
in
the
parlour
till
the
return
which
he
expected
every
moment
ferdinand
who
had
taken
post
in
a
proper
place
for
observation
seeing
his
antagonist
fairly
admitted
took
the
same
road
and
appearing
before
him
wrapped
up
in
a
long
spanish
cloak
desired
to
know
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
such
an
early
visit
the
swiss
raising
his
voice
to
conceal
his
agitation
explained
his
errand
in
demanding
reparation
for
the
injury
his
honour
had
sustained
the
preceding
day
in
that
odious
allusion
to
a
scandalous
report
which
had
been
raised
by
the
malice
of
his
enemies
and
insisted
in
a
very
imperious
style
upon
his
attending
him
forthwith
to
the
nursery
in
hyde
park
have
a
little
patience
said
our
adventurer
with
great
composure
and
i
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
to
wait
upon
you
in
a
few
with
these
words
he
rang
the
bell
and
calling
for
a
bason
of
water
laid
aside
his
cloak
and
displayed
himself
in
his
shirt
with
a
sword
in
his
right
hand
which
was
all
over
besmeared
with
recent
blood
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
the
slaughter
of
a
foe
this
phenomenon
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
astonished
chevalier
already
discomposed
by
the
resolute
behaviour
of
the
count
that
he
became
jaundiced
with
terror
and
dismay
and
while
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
told
our
hero
he
had
hoped
from
his
known
politeness
to
have
found
him
ready
to
acknowledge
an
injury
which
might
have
been
the
effect
of
anger
or
misapprehension
in
which
case
the
affair
might
have
been
compromised
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
without
proceeding
to
those
extremities
which
among
men
of
honour
are
always
accounted
the
last
resource
to
this
representation
ferdinand
answered
that
the
affair
had
been
of
the
chevalier
own
seeking
inasmuch
as
he
had
intruded
himself
into
his
company
and
treated
him
with
the
most
insolent
and
unprovoked
abuse
which
plainly
flowed
from
a
premeditated
design
against
his
honour
and
reputation
he
therefore
far
from
being
disposed
to
own
himself
in
the
wrong
would
not
even
accept
of
a
public
acknowledgment
from
him
the
aggressor
whom
he
looked
upon
as
an
infamous
sharper
and
was
resolved
to
chastise
accordingly
here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
person
who
was
brought
to
the
door
in
a
chair
and
conducted
into
another
apartment
from
which
a
message
was
brought
to
the
count
importing
that
the
stranger
desired
to
speak
with
him
upon
business
of
the
last
importance
fathom
having
chid
the
servant
for
admitting
people
without
his
order
desired
the
swiss
to
excuse
him
for
a
minute
longer
and
went
in
to
the
next
room
from
whence
the
following
dialogue
was
overheard
by
this
challenger
count
said
the
stranger
you
are
not
ignorant
of
my
pretensions
to
the
heart
of
that
young
lady
at
whose
house
i
met
you
yesterday
therefore
you
can
not
be
surprised
when
i
declare
myself
displeased
with
your
visits
and
behaviour
to
my
mistress
and
demand
that
you
will
instantly
promise
to
drop
the
else
what
follows
answered
ferdinand
with
a
cool
and
temperate
voice
my
resentment
and
immediate
defiance
replied
the
other
for
the
only
alternative
i
propose
is
to
forego
your
design
upon
that
lady
or
to
decide
our
pretension
by
the
our
hero
having
expressed
a
regard
for
this
visitant
as
the
son
of
a
gentleman
whom
he
honoured
was
at
the
pains
to
represent
the
unreasonableness
of
his
demand
and
the
folly
of
his
presumption
and
earnestly
exhorted
him
to
put
the
issue
of
his
cause
upon
a
more
safe
and
equitable
footing
but
this
admonition
instead
of
appeasing
the
wrath
seemed
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
opponent
who
swore
he
would
not
leave
him
until
he
should
have
accomplished
the
purport
of
his
errand
in
vain
our
adventurer
requested
half
an
hour
for
the
despatch
of
some
urgent
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
with
a
gentleman
in
the
other
parlour
this
impetuous
rival
rejected
all
the
terms
he
could
propose
and
even
challenged
him
to
decide
the
controversy
upon
the
spot
an
expedient
to
which
the
other
having
assented
with
reluctance
the
door
was
secured
the
swords
unsheathed
and
a
hot
engagement
ensued
to
the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
the
swiss
who
did
not
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
screened
from
all
danger
by
the
event
of
this
rencontre
nevertheless
his
hope
was
disappointed
in
the
defeat
of
the
stranger
who
was
quickly
disarmed
in
consequence
of
a
wound
through
the
upon
which
occasion
fathom
was
heard
to
say
that
in
consideration
of
his
youth
and
family
he
had
spared
his
life
but
he
would
not
act
with
the
same
tenderness
towards
any
other
antagonist
he
then
bound
up
the
limb
he
had
disabled
conducted
the
vanquished
party
to
his
chair
rejoined
the
chevalier
with
a
serene
countenance
and
asking
pardon
for
having
detained
him
so
long
proposed
they
should
instantly
set
out
in
a
for
the
place
of
appointment
the
stratagem
thus
conducted
had
all
the
success
the
inventor
could
desire
the
fear
of
the
swiss
had
risen
almost
to
an
ecstasy
before
the
count
quitted
the
room
but
after
this
sham
battle
which
had
been
preconcerted
betwixt
our
adventurer
and
his
friend
ratchcali
the
chevalier
terrors
were
unspeakable
he
considered
fathom
as
a
devil
incarnate
and
went
into
the
coach
as
a
malefactor
bound
for
tyburn
he
would
have
gladly
compounded
for
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
arm
and
entertained
some
transient
gleams
of
hope
that
he
should
escape
for
half
a
dozen
which
he
would
have
willingly
received
as
the
price
of
his
presumption
but
these
hopes
were
banished
by
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
declaration
which
he
had
heard
the
count
make
after
having
overcome
his
last
adversary
and
he
continued
under
the
power
of
the
most
unsupportable
panic
until
the
carriage
halted
at
hyde
park
corner
where
he
crawled
forth
in
a
most
piteous
and
lamentable
condition
so
that
when
they
reached
the
spot
he
was
scarce
able
to
stand
here
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
propose
an
accommodation
upon
a
new
plan
by
which
he
promised
to
leave
his
cause
to
the
arbitrement
of
those
gentlemen
who
were
present
at
the
rupture
and
to
ask
pardon
of
the
count
provided
he
should
be
found
guilty
of
a
trespass
upon
good
manners
but
this
proposal
would
not
satisfy
the
implacable
ferdinand
who
perceiving
the
agony
of
the
swiss
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
the
adventure
and
giving
him
to
understand
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
desired
him
to
draw
without
further
preamble
thus
compelled
the
unfortunate
gamester
pulled
off
his
coat
and
putting
himself
in
a
posture
to
use
the
words
of
nym
winked
and
held
out
his
cold
our
adventurer
far
from
making
a
gentle
use
of
the
advantages
he
possessed
fiercely
attacked
him
while
he
was
incapable
of
making
resistance
and
aiming
at
a
fleshy
part
ran
him
through
the
arm
and
outside
of
the
shoulder
at
the
very
first
pass
the
chevalier
already
stupefied
with
the
horror
of
expectation
no
sooner
felt
his
point
in
his
body
than
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
concluding
he
was
no
longer
a
man
for
this
world
began
to
cross
himself
with
great
devotion
while
fathom
walked
home
deliberately
and
in
his
way
sent
a
couple
of
chairmen
to
the
assistance
of
the
wounded
knight
this
achievement
which
could
not
be
concealed
from
the
knowledge
of
the
public
not
only
furnished
the
character
of
fathom
with
fresh
wreaths
of
admiration
and
applause
but
likewise
effectually
secured
him
from
any
future
attempts
of
his
enemies
to
whom
the
swiss
for
his
own
sake
had
communicated
such
terrible
ideas
of
his
valour
as
overawed
the
whole
community
chapter
he
performs
another
exploit
that
conveys
a
true
idea
of
his
gratitude
and
honour
it
was
not
long
after
this
celebrated
victory
that
he
was
invited
to
spend
part
of
the
summer
at
the
house
of
a
country
gentleman
who
lived
about
one
hundred
miles
from
london
possessed
of
a
very
opulent
fortune
the
greatest
part
of
which
was
expended
in
acts
of
old
english
hospitality
he
had
met
with
our
hero
by
accident
at
the
table
of
a
certain
great
man
and
was
so
struck
with
his
manner
and
conversation
as
to
desire
his
acquaintance
and
cultivate
his
friendship
and
he
thought
himself
extremely
happy
in
having
prevailed
upon
him
to
pass
a
few
weeks
in
his
family
fathom
among
his
other
observations
perceived
that
there
was
a
domestic
uneasiness
occasioned
by
a
very
beautiful
young
creature
about
the
age
of
fifteen
who
resided
in
the
house
under
the
title
of
the
niece
though
she
was
in
reality
his
natural
daughter
born
before
his
marriage
this
circumstance
was
not
unknown
to
his
lady
by
whose
express
approbation
he
had
bestowed
particular
attention
upon
the
education
of
the
child
whom
we
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
celinda
their
liberality
in
this
particular
had
not
been
misapplied
for
she
not
only
gave
marks
of
uncommon
capacity
but
as
she
grew
up
became
more
and
more
amiable
in
her
person
and
was
now
returned
from
the
boarding
school
possessed
of
every
accomplishment
that
could
be
acquired
by
one
of
her
age
and
opportunities
these
qualifications
which
endeared
her
to
every
other
person
excited
the
jealousy
and
displeasure
of
her
supposed
aunt
who
could
not
bear
to
see
her
own
children
eclipsed
by
this
illegitimate
daughter
whom
she
therefore
discountenanced
upon
all
occasions
and
exposed
to
such
mortifications
as
would
in
all
appearance
drive
her
from
her
father
house
this
persecuting
spirit
was
very
disagreeable
to
the
husband
who
loved
celinda
with
a
truly
paternal
affection
and
produced
abundance
of
family
disquiet
but
being
a
man
of
a
peaceable
and
yielding
disposition
he
could
not
long
maintain
the
resolution
he
had
taken
in
her
favour
and
therefore
he
ceased
opposing
the
malevolence
of
his
wife
in
this
unfortunate
predicament
stood
the
fair
bastard
at
the
arrival
of
our
adventurer
who
being
allured
by
her
charms
apprised
of
her
situation
at
the
same
time
took
the
generous
resolution
to
undermine
her
innocence
that
he
might
banquet
his
vicious
appetite
with
the
spoils
of
her
beauty
perhaps
such
a
brutal
design
might
not
have
entered
his
imagination
if
he
had
not
observed
in
the
disposition
of
this
hapless
maiden
certain
peculiarities
from
which
he
derived
the
most
confident
presages
of
success
besides
a
total
want
of
experience
that
left
her
open
and
unguarded
against
the
attacks
of
the
other
sex
she
discovered
a
remarkable
spirit
of
credulity
and
superstitious
fear
which
had
been
cherished
by
the
conversation
of
her
she
was
particularly
fond
of
music
in
which
she
had
made
some
progress
but
so
delicate
was
the
texture
of
her
nerves
that
one
day
while
fathom
entertained
the
company
with
a
favourite
air
she
actually
swooned
with
pleasure
such
sensibility
our
projector
well
knew
must
be
diffused
through
all
the
passions
of
her
heart
he
congratulated
himself
upon
the
sure
ascendency
he
had
gained
over
her
in
this
particular
and
forthwith
began
to
execute
the
plan
he
had
erected
for
her
destruction
that
he
might
the
more
effectually
deceive
the
vigilance
of
her
father
wife
he
threw
such
a
dash
of
affectation
in
his
complaisance
towards
celinda
as
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
that
prying
matron
though
it
was
not
palpable
enough
to
disoblige
the
young
lady
herself
who
could
not
so
well
distinguish
between
overstrained
courtesy
and
real
good
breeding
this
behaviour
screened
him
from
the
suspicion
of
the
family
who
considered
it
as
an
effort
of
politeness
to
cover
his
indifference
and
disgust
for
the
daughter
of
his
friend
who
had
by
this
time
given
some
reason
to
believe
she
looked
upon
him
with
the
eyes
of
affection
so
that
the
opportunities
he
enjoyed
of
conversing
with
her
in
private
were
less
liable
to
intrusion
or
inquiry
indeed
from
what
i
have
already
observed
touching
the
sentiments
of
her
stepdame
that
lady
far
from
taking
measures
for
thwarting
our
hero
design
would
have
rejoiced
at
the
execution
of
it
and
had
she
been
informed
of
his
intent
might
have
fallen
upon
some
method
to
facilitate
the
enterprise
but
as
he
solely
depended
upon
his
own
talents
he
never
dreamed
of
soliciting
such
an
auxiliary
under
cover
of
instructing
and
accomplishing
her
in
the
exercise
of
music
he
could
not
want
occasions
for
promoting
his
aim
when
after
having
soothed
her
sense
of
hearing
even
to
a
degree
of
ravishment
so
as
to
extort
from
her
an
exclamation
importing
that
he
was
surely
something
supernatural
he
never
failed
to
whisper
some
insidious
compliment
or
tale
of
love
exquisitely
suited
to
the
emotions
of
her
soul
thus
was
her
heart
insensibly
subdued
though
more
than
half
his
work
was
still
undone
for
at
all
times
she
disclosed
such
purity
of
sentiment
such
inviolable
attachment
to
religion
and
virtue
and
seemed
so
averse
to
all
sorts
of
inflammatory
discourse
that
he
durst
not
presume
upon
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
her
affection
to
explain
the
baseness
of
his
desire
he
therefore
applied
to
another
of
her
passions
that
proved
the
bane
of
her
virtue
this
was
her
timidity
which
at
first
being
constitutional
was
afterwards
increased
by
the
circumstances
of
her
education
and
now
aggravated
by
the
artful
conversation
of
fathom
which
he
chequered
with
dismal
stories
of
omens
portents
prophecies
and
apparitions
delivered
upon
such
unquestionable
testimony
and
with
such
marks
of
conviction
as
captivated
the
belief
of
the
devoted
celinda
and
filled
her
imagination
with
unceasing
terrors
in
vain
she
strove
to
dispel
those
frightful
ideas
and
avoid
such
topics
of
discourse
for
the
future
the
more
she
endeavoured
to
banish
them
the
more
troublesome
they
became
and
such
was
her
infatuation
that
as
her
terrors
increased
her
thirst
after
that
sort
of
knowledge
was
augmented
many
sleepless
nights
did
she
pass
amidst
those
horrors
of
fancy
starting
at
every
noise
and
sweating
with
dreary
apprehension
yet
ashamed
to
own
her
fears
or
solicit
the
comfort
of
a
bedfellow
lest
she
should
incur
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
her
father
wife
and
what
rendered
this
disposition
the
more
irksome
was
the
solitary
situation
of
her
chamber
that
stood
at
the
end
of
a
long
gallery
scarce
within
hearing
of
any
other
inhabited
part
of
the
house
all
these
circumstances
had
been
duly
weighed
by
our
projector
who
having
prepared
celinda
for
his
purpose
stole
at
midnight
from
his
apartment
which
was
in
another
storey
and
approaching
her
door
there
uttered
a
piteous
groan
then
softly
retired
to
his
bed
in
full
confidence
of
seeing
next
day
the
effect
of
this
operation
nor
did
his
arrow
miss
the
mark
poor
celinda
countenance
gave
such
indications
of
melancholy
and
dismay
that
he
could
not
omit
asking
the
cause
of
her
disquiet
and
she
at
his
earnest
request
was
prevailed
upon
to
communicate
the
dreadful
salutation
of
the
preceding
night
which
she
considered
as
an
omen
of
death
to
some
person
of
the
family
in
all
probability
to
herself
as
the
groan
seemed
to
issue
from
one
corner
of
her
own
apartment
our
adventurer
argued
against
this
supposition
as
contradictory
to
the
common
observation
of
those
supernatural
warnings
which
are
not
usually
imparted
to
the
person
who
is
doomed
to
die
but
to
some
faithful
friend
or
trusty
servant
particularly
interested
in
the
event
he
therefore
supposed
that
the
groans
foreboded
the
death
of
my
lady
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
drooping
state
of
health
and
were
by
her
genius
conveyed
to
the
organs
of
celinda
who
was
the
chief
sufferer
by
her
jealous
and
barbarous
disposition
he
likewise
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
be
an
of
such
solemn
communication
and
alleging
that
it
was
highly
improper
for
a
young
lady
of
her
delicate
feelings
to
expose
herself
alone
to
such
another
dismal
visitation
begged
he
might
be
allowed
to
watch
all
night
in
her
chamber
in
order
to
defend
her
from
the
shocking
impressions
of
fear
though
no
person
ever
stood
more
in
need
of
a
companion
or
guard
and
her
heart
throbbed
with
transports
of
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
night
she
rejected
his
proposal
with
due
acknowledgment
and
resolved
to
trust
solely
to
the
protection
of
heaven
not
that
she
thought
her
innocence
or
reputation
could
suffer
by
her
compliance
with
his
request
for
hitherto
her
heart
was
a
stranger
to
those
young
desires
which
haunt
the
fancy
and
warm
the
breast
of
youth
so
that
being
ignorant
of
her
danger
she
saw
not
the
necessity
of
avoiding
temptation
but
she
refused
to
admit
a
man
into
her
bedchamber
merely
because
it
was
a
step
altogether
opposite
to
the
forms
and
decorum
of
life
nevertheless
far
from
being
discouraged
by
this
repulse
he
knew
her
fears
would
multiply
and
reduce
that
reluctance
which
in
order
to
weaken
he
had
recourse
to
another
piece
of
machinery
that
operated
powerfully
in
behalf
of
his
design
some
years
ago
a
instrument
was
contrived
by
a
very
ingenious
musician
by
whom
it
was
aptly
entitled
the
harp
of
aeolus
because
being
properly
applied
to
a
stream
of
air
it
produces
a
wild
irregular
variety
of
harmonious
sounds
that
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
enchantment
and
wonderfully
dispose
the
mind
for
the
most
romantic
situations
fathom
who
was
really
a
virtuoso
in
music
had
brought
one
of
those
guitars
into
the
country
and
as
the
effect
of
it
was
still
unknown
in
the
family
he
that
night
converted
it
to
the
purposes
of
his
amour
by
fixing
it
in
the
casement
of
a
window
belonging
to
the
gallery
exposed
to
the
west
wind
which
then
blew
in
a
gentle
breeze
the
strings
no
sooner
felt
the
impression
of
the
balmy
zephyr
than
they
began
to
pour
forth
a
stream
of
melody
more
ravishingly
delightful
than
the
song
of
philomel
the
warbling
brook
and
all
the
concert
of
the
wood
the
soft
and
tender
notes
of
peace
and
love
were
swelled
up
with
the
most
delicate
and
insensible
transition
into
a
loud
hymn
of
triumph
and
exultation
joined
by
the
organ
and
a
full
choir
of
voices
which
gradually
decayed
upon
the
ear
until
it
died
away
in
distant
sound
as
if
a
flight
of
angels
had
raised
the
song
in
their
ascent
to
heaven
yet
the
chords
hardly
ceased
to
vibrate
after
the
expiration
of
this
overture
which
ushered
in
a
composition
in
the
same
pathetic
style
and
this
again
was
succeeded
by
a
third
almost
without
pause
or
intermission
as
if
the
artist
hand
had
been
indefatigable
and
the
theme
never
to
be
exhausted
his
heart
must
be
quite
callous
and
his
ear
lost
to
all
distinction
who
could
hear
such
harmony
without
emotion
how
deeply
then
must
it
have
affected
the
delicate
celinda
whose
sensations
naturally
acute
were
whetted
to
a
most
painful
keenness
by
her
apprehension
who
could
have
no
previous
idea
of
such
entertainment
and
was
credulous
enough
to
believe
the
most
improbable
tale
of
superstition
she
was
overwhelmed
with
awful
terror
and
never
doubting
that
the
sounds
were
more
than
mortal
recommended
herself
to
the
care
of
providence
in
a
succession
of
pious
ejaculations
our
adventurer
having
allowed
some
time
for
the
effect
of
this
contrivance
repaired
to
her
chamber
door
and
in
a
whisper
conveyed
through
the
keyhole
asked
if
she
was
awake
begged
pardon
for
such
an
unseasonable
visit
and
desired
to
know
her
opinion
of
the
strange
music
which
he
then
heard
in
spite
of
her
notions
of
decency
she
was
glad
of
his
intrusion
and
being
in
no
condition
to
observe
punctilios
slipped
on
a
wrapper
opened
the
door
and
with
a
faltering
voice
owned
herself
frightened
almost
to
distraction
he
pretended
to
console
her
with
reflections
importing
that
she
was
in
the
hands
of
a
benevolent
being
who
would
not
impose
upon
his
creatures
any
task
which
they
could
not
bear
he
insisted
upon
her
returning
to
bed
and
assured
her
he
would
not
stir
from
her
chamber
till
day
thus
comforted
she
betook
herself
again
to
rest
while
he
sat
down
in
an
at
some
distance
from
the
bedside
and
in
a
soft
voice
began
the
conversation
with
her
on
the
subject
of
those
visitations
from
above
which
though
undertaken
on
pretence
of
dissipating
her
fear
and
anxiety
was
in
reality
calculated
for
the
purpose
of
augmenting
both
that
sweet
air
said
he
seems
designed
for
soothing
the
bodily
anguish
of
some
saint
in
his
last
moments
hark
how
it
rises
into
a
more
sprightly
and
elevated
strain
as
if
it
were
an
inspiriting
invitation
to
the
realms
of
bliss
sure
he
is
now
absolved
from
all
the
misery
of
this
life
that
full
and
glorious
concert
of
voices
and
celestial
harps
betoken
his
reception
among
the
heavenly
choir
who
now
waft
his
soul
to
paradisian
joys
this
is
altogether
great
solemn
and
amazing
the
clock
strikes
one
the
symphony
hath
ceased
this
was
actually
the
case
for
he
had
ordered
maurice
to
remove
the
instrument
at
that
hour
lest
the
sound
of
it
should
become
too
familiar
and
excite
the
curiosity
of
some
undaunted
domestic
who
might
frustrate
his
scheme
by
discovering
the
apparatus
as
for
poor
celinda
her
fancy
was
by
his
music
and
discourse
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
terrors
the
whole
bed
shook
with
her
trepidation
the
awful
silence
that
succeeded
the
supernatural
music
threw
an
additional
damp
upon
her
spirits
and
the
artful
fathom
affecting
to
snore
at
the
same
time
she
could
no
longer
contain
her
horror
but
called
upon
his
name
with
a
fearful
accent
and
having
owned
her
present
situation
insupportable
entreated
him
to
draw
near
her
bedside
that
he
might
be
within
touch
on
any
emergency
this
was
a
welcome
request
to
our
adventurer
who
asking
pardon
for
his
drowsiness
and
taking
his
station
on
the
side
of
her
bed
exhorted
her
to
compose
herself
then
locking
her
hand
fast
in
his
own
was
again
seized
with
such
an
inclination
to
sleep
that
he
gradually
sunk
down
by
her
side
and
seemed
to
enjoy
his
repose
in
that
attitude
meanwhile
his
mistress
that
he
might
not
suffer
in
his
health
by
his
humanity
and
complaisance
covered
him
with
the
counterpane
as
he
slept
and
suffered
him
to
take
his
rest
without
interruption
till
he
thought
proper
to
start
up
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
of
heaven
watch
over
us
and
then
asked
with
symptoms
of
astonishment
if
she
had
heard
nothing
such
an
abrupt
address
upon
such
an
occasion
did
not
fail
to
amaze
and
affright
the
gentle
celinda
who
unable
to
speak
sprung
towards
her
treacherous
protector
and
he
catching
her
in
his
arms
bade
her
fear
nothing
for
he
would
at
the
expense
of
his
life
defend
her
from
all
danger
having
thus
by
tampering
with
her
weakness
conquered
the
first
and
chief
obstacles
to
his
design
he
with
great
art
and
perseverance
improved
the
intercourse
to
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
as
could
not
but
be
productive
of
all
the
consequences
which
he
had
foreseen
the
groans
and
music
were
occasionally
repeated
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
family
and
inspire
a
thousand
various
conjectures
he
failed
not
to
continue
his
nocturnal
visits
and
ghastly
discourse
until
his
attendance
became
so
necessary
to
this
unhappy
maiden
that
she
durst
not
stay
in
her
own
chamber
without
his
company
nor
even
sleep
except
in
contact
with
her
betrayer
such
a
commerce
between
two
such
persons
of
a
different
sex
could
not
possibly
be
long
carried
on
without
degenerating
from
the
platonic
system
of
sentimental
love
in
her
paroxysms
of
dismay
he
did
not
forget
to
breathe
the
soft
inspirations
of
his
passion
to
which
she
listened
with
more
pleasure
as
they
diverted
the
gloomy
ideas
of
her
fear
and
by
this
time
his
extraordinary
accomplishments
had
made
a
conquest
of
her
heart
what
therefore
could
be
a
more
interesting
transition
than
that
from
the
most
uneasy
to
the
most
agreeable
sensation
of
the
human
breast
this
being
the
case
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
a
consummate
traitor
like
fathom
should
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
an
artless
innocent
young
creature
whose
passions
he
had
entirely
under
his
command
the
gradations
towards
vice
are
almost
imperceptible
and
an
experienced
seducer
can
strew
them
with
such
enticing
and
agreeable
flowers
as
will
lead
the
young
sinner
on
insensibly
even
to
the
most
profligate
stages
of
guilt
all
therefore
that
can
be
done
by
virtue
unassisted
with
experience
is
to
avoid
every
trial
with
such
a
formidable
foe
by
declining
and
discouraging
the
first
advances
towards
a
particular
correspondence
with
perfidious
man
howsoever
agreeable
it
may
seem
to
be
for
here
is
no
security
but
in
conscious
weakness
fathom
though
possessed
of
the
spoils
of
poor
celinda
honour
did
not
enjoy
his
success
with
tranquillity
reflection
and
remorse
often
invaded
her
in
the
midst
of
their
guilty
pleasures
and
embittered
all
those
moments
they
had
dedicated
to
mutual
bliss
for
the
seeds
of
virtue
are
seldom
destroyed
at
once
even
amidst
the
rank
productions
of
vice
they
regerminate
to
a
sort
of
imperfect
vegetation
like
some
scattered
hyacinths
shooting
up
among
the
weeds
of
a
ruined
garden
that
testify
the
former
culture
and
amenity
of
the
soil
she
sighed
at
the
sad
remembrance
of
that
virgin
dignity
which
she
had
lost
she
wept
at
the
prospect
of
that
disgrace
mortification
and
misery
she
should
undergo
when
abandoned
by
this
transient
lover
and
severely
reproached
him
for
the
arts
he
had
used
to
shipwreck
her
innocence
and
peace
such
expostulations
are
extremely
unseasonable
when
addressed
to
a
man
sated
with
the
effects
of
his
conquest
they
act
like
strong
blasts
of
wind
applied
to
embers
almost
extinguished
which
instead
of
reviving
the
flame
scatter
and
destroy
every
remaining
particle
of
fire
our
adventurer
in
the
midst
of
his
peculiarities
had
inconstancy
in
common
with
the
rest
of
his
sex
more
than
half
cloyed
with
the
possession
of
celinda
he
could
not
fail
to
be
disgusted
with
her
upbraidings
and
had
she
not
been
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
whose
friendship
he
did
not
think
it
his
interest
to
forfeit
he
would
have
dropped
this
correspondence
without
reluctance
or
hesitation
but
as
he
had
measures
to
keep
with
a
family
of
such
consequence
he
constrained
his
inclinations
so
far
as
to
counterfeit
those
raptures
he
no
longer
felt
and
found
means
to
appease
those
intervening
tumults
of
her
grief
foreseeing
however
that
it
would
not
be
always
in
his
power
to
console
her
on
these
terms
he
resolved
if
possible
to
divide
her
affection
which
now
glowed
upon
him
too
intensely
and
with
that
view
whenever
she
complained
of
the
vapours
or
dejection
he
prescribed
and
even
insisted
upon
her
swallowing
certain
cordials
of
the
most
palatable
composition
without
which
he
never
travelled
and
these
produced
such
agreeable
reveries
and
flow
of
spirits
that
she
gradually
became
enamoured
of
intoxication
while
he
encouraged
the
pernicious
passion
by
expressing
the
most
extravagant
applause
and
admiration
at
the
wild
irregular
sallies
it
produced
without
having
first
made
this
diversion
he
would
have
found
it
impracticable
to
leave
the
house
with
tranquillity
but
when
this
bewitching
philtre
grew
into
an
habit
her
attachment
to
ferdinand
was
insensibly
dissolved
she
began
to
bear
his
neglect
with
indifference
and
sequestering
herself
from
the
rest
of
the
family
used
to
solicit
this
new
ally
for
consolation
having
thus
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
daughter
ruin
he
took
leave
of
the
father
with
many
acknowledgments
and
expressions
of
gratitude
for
his
hospitality
and
friendship
and
riding
across
the
country
to
bristol
took
up
his
habitation
near
the
hot
well
where
he
stayed
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
season
as
for
the
miserable
celinda
she
became
more
and
more
addicted
to
the
vices
in
which
she
had
been
initiated
by
his
superlative
perfidy
and
craft
until
she
was
quite
abandoned
by
decency
and
caution
her
father
heart
was
torn
with
anguish
while
his
wife
rejoiced
in
her
fall
at
length
her
ideas
were
quite
debased
by
her
infirmity
she
grew
every
day
more
and
more
sensual
and
degenerate
and
contracted
an
intimacy
with
one
of
the
footmen
who
was
kind
enough
to
take
her
to
wife
in
hope
of
obtaining
a
good
settlement
from
his
master
but
being
disappointed
in
his
aim
he
conducted
her
to
london
where
he
made
shift
to
insinuate
himself
into
another
service
leaving
her
to
the
use
and
partly
the
advantage
of
her
own
person
which
was
still
uncommonly
attractive
chapter
he
repairs
to
bristol
spring
where
he
reigns
paramount
during
the
whole
season
we
shall
therefore
leave
her
in
this
comfortable
situation
and
return
to
our
adventurer
whose
appearance
at
bristol
was
considered
as
a
happy
omen
by
the
proprietor
of
the
hot
well
and
all
the
people
who
live
by
the
resort
of
company
to
that
celebrated
spring
nor
were
they
deceived
in
their
prognostic
fathom
as
usual
formed
the
nucleus
or
kernel
of
the
beau
monde
and
the
season
soon
became
so
crowded
that
many
people
of
fashion
were
obliged
to
quit
the
place
for
want
of
lodging
ferdinand
was
the
soul
that
animated
the
whole
society
he
not
only
invented
parties
of
pleasure
but
also
by
his
personal
talents
rendered
them
more
agreeable
in
a
word
he
regulated
their
diversions
and
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
never
would
allow
the
ball
to
be
begun
till
the
count
was
seated
having
thus
made
himself
the
object
of
admiration
and
esteem
his
advice
was
an
oracle
to
which
they
had
recourse
in
all
doubtful
cases
of
punctilio
or
dispute
or
even
of
medicine
for
among
his
other
accomplishments
his
discourse
on
that
subject
was
so
plausible
and
well
adapted
to
the
understanding
of
his
hearers
that
any
person
who
had
not
actually
studied
the
medical
art
would
have
believed
he
was
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
aesculapius
what
contributed
to
the
aggrandisement
of
his
character
in
this
branch
of
knowledge
was
a
victory
he
obtained
over
an
old
physician
who
plied
at
the
well
and
had
one
day
unfortunately
begun
to
harangue
in
the
upon
the
nature
of
the
bristol
water
in
the
course
of
this
lecture
he
undertook
to
account
for
the
warmth
of
the
fluid
and
his
ideas
being
perplexed
with
a
great
deal
of
reading
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
digest
his
disquisition
was
so
indistinct
and
his
expression
so
obscure
and
unentertaining
that
our
hero
seized
the
opportunity
of
displaying
his
own
erudition
by
venturing
to
contradict
some
circumstances
of
the
doctor
hypothesis
and
substituting
a
theory
of
his
own
which
as
he
had
invented
it
for
the
purpose
was
equally
amusing
and
chimerical
he
alleged
that
fire
was
the
sole
vivifying
principle
that
pervaded
all
nature
that
as
the
heat
of
the
sun
concocted
the
juice
of
vegetables
and
ripened
those
fruits
that
grow
upon
the
surface
of
this
globe
there
was
likewise
an
immense
store
of
central
fire
reserved
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
not
only
for
the
generation
of
gems
fossils
and
all
the
purposes
of
the
mineral
world
but
likewise
for
cherishing
and
keeping
alive
those
plants
which
would
otherwise
perish
by
the
winter
cold
the
existence
of
such
a
fire
he
proved
from
the
nature
of
all
those
volcanoes
which
in
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
are
continually
vomiting
up
either
flames
or
smoke
these
said
he
are
the
great
vents
appointed
by
nature
for
the
discharge
of
that
rarefied
air
and
combustible
matter
which
if
confined
would
burst
the
globe
asunder
but
besides
the
larger
outlets
there
are
some
small
chimneys
through
which
part
of
the
heat
transpires
a
vapour
of
that
sort
i
conceive
must
pass
through
the
bed
or
channel
of
this
spring
the
waters
of
which
accordingly
retain
a
moderate
this
account
which
totally
overthrew
the
other
doctrine
was
so
extremely
agreeable
to
the
audience
that
the
testy
doctor
lost
his
temper
and
gave
them
to
understand
without
preamble
that
he
must
be
a
person
wholly
ignorant
of
natural
philosophy
who
could
invent
such
a
ridiculous
system
and
they
involved
in
worse
than
an
egyptian
fog
that
could
not
at
once
discern
its
weakness
and
absurdity
this
declaration
introduced
a
dispute
which
was
unanimously
determined
in
favour
of
our
adventurer
on
all
such
occasions
the
stream
of
prejudice
runs
against
the
physician
even
though
his
antagonist
has
nothing
to
recommend
himself
to
the
favour
of
the
spectators
and
this
decision
depends
upon
divers
considerations
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
continual
war
carried
on
against
the
learned
professions
by
all
those
who
conscious
of
their
own
ignorance
seek
to
level
the
reputation
of
their
superiors
with
their
own
secondly
in
all
disputes
upon
physic
that
happen
betwixt
a
person
who
really
understands
the
art
and
an
illiterate
pretender
the
arguments
of
the
first
will
seem
obscure
and
unintelligible
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
previous
systems
on
which
they
are
built
while
the
other
theory
derived
from
common
notions
and
superficial
observation
will
be
more
agreeable
because
better
adapted
to
the
comprehension
of
the
hearers
thirdly
the
judgment
of
the
multitude
is
apt
to
be
biassed
by
that
surprise
which
is
the
effect
of
seeing
an
artist
foiled
at
his
own
weapons
by
one
who
engages
him
only
for
amusement
fathom
besides
these
advantages
was
blessed
with
a
flow
of
language
an
elegant
address
a
polite
and
style
of
argumentation
together
with
a
temper
not
to
be
ruffled
so
that
the
victory
could
not
long
waver
between
him
and
the
physician
to
whom
he
was
infinitely
superior
in
every
acquisition
but
that
of
solid
learning
of
which
the
judges
had
no
idea
this
contest
was
not
only
glorious
but
profitable
to
our
adventurer
who
grew
into
such
request
in
his
medical
capacity
that
the
poor
doctor
was
utterly
deserted
by
his
patients
and
fathom
advice
solicited
by
every
valetudinarian
in
the
place
nor
did
he
forfeit
the
character
he
thus
acquired
by
any
miscarriages
in
his
practice
being
but
little
conversant
with
the
materia
medica
the
circle
of
his
prescriptions
was
very
small
his
chief
study
was
to
avoid
all
drugs
of
rough
operation
and
uncertain
effect
and
to
administer
such
only
as
should
be
agreeable
to
the
palate
without
doing
violence
to
the
constitution
such
a
physician
could
not
but
be
agreeable
to
people
of
all
dispositions
and
as
most
of
the
patients
were
in
some
shape
hypochondriac
the
power
of
imagination
with
his
remedies
often
effected
a
cure
on
the
whole
it
became
the
fashion
to
consult
the
count
in
all
distempers
and
his
reputation
would
have
had
its
run
though
the
death
of
every
patient
had
given
the
lie
to
his
pretensions
but
empty
fame
was
not
the
sole
fruit
of
his
success
though
no
person
would
presume
to
affront
this
noble
graduate
with
a
fee
they
did
not
fail
to
manifest
their
gratitude
by
some
more
valuable
present
every
day
some
superb
piece
of
china
curious
snuffbox
or
jewel
was
pressed
upon
him
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
could
almost
have
furnished
a
toyshop
with
the
acknowledgments
he
had
received
not
only
his
avarice
but
his
pleasure
was
gratified
in
the
course
of
his
medical
administration
he
enjoyed
free
access
egress
and
regress
with
all
the
females
at
the
well
and
no
matron
scrupled
to
put
her
daughter
under
his
care
and
direction
these
opportunities
could
not
be
lost
upon
a
man
of
his
intriguing
genius
though
he
conducted
his
amours
with
such
discretion
that
during
the
whole
season
no
lady
character
suffered
on
his
account
yet
he
was
highly
fortunate
in
his
addresses
and
we
may
venture
to
affirm
that
the
reproach
of
barrenness
was
more
than
once
removed
by
the
vigour
of
his
endeavours
chapter
he
is
smitten
with
the
charms
of
a
female
adventurer
whose
allurements
subject
him
to
a
new
vicissitude
of
fortune
among
those
who
were
distinguished
by
his
gallantry
was
the
young
wife
of
an
old
citizen
of
london
who
had
granted
her
permission
to
reside
at
the
hot
well
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
under
the
eye
and
inspection
of
his
own
sister
who
was
a
maiden
of
fifty
years
the
pupil
whose
name
was
trapwell
though
low
in
stature
was
finely
shaped
her
countenance
engaging
though
her
complexion
was
brown
her
hair
in
colour
rivalled
the
raven
back
and
her
eyes
emulated
the
lustre
of
the
diamond
fathom
had
been
struck
with
her
first
appearance
but
found
it
impracticable
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
her
duenna
so
as
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
flame
until
she
herself
guessing
the
situation
of
his
thoughts
and
not
displeased
with
the
discovery
thought
proper
to
furnish
him
with
the
opportunity
he
wanted
by
counterfeiting
an
indisposition
for
the
cure
of
which
she
knew
his
advice
would
be
implored
this
was
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
which
was
soon
improved
to
his
wish
and
so
well
did
she
manage
her
attractions
as
in
some
measure
to
fix
the
inconstancy
of
his
disposition
for
at
the
end
of
the
season
his
passion
was
not
sated
and
they
concerted
the
means
of
continuing
their
commerce
even
after
their
return
to
london
this
intercourse
effectually
answered
the
purpose
of
the
husband
who
had
been
decoyed
into
matrimony
by
the
cunning
of
his
spouse
whom
he
had
privately
kept
as
a
concubine
before
marriage
conscious
of
her
own
precarious
situation
she
had
resolved
to
impose
upon
the
infirmities
of
trapwell
and
feigning
herself
pregnant
gave
him
to
understand
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
condition
from
the
knowledge
of
her
brother
who
was
an
officer
in
the
army
and
of
such
violent
passions
that
should
he
once
discover
her
backsliding
he
would
undoubtedly
wipe
away
the
stains
of
his
family
dishonour
with
her
own
blood
as
well
as
that
of
her
keeper
the
citizen
to
prevent
such
a
catastrophe
took
her
to
wife
but
soon
after
perceiving
the
trick
which
had
been
played
upon
him
set
his
invention
at
work
and
at
length
contrived
a
scheme
which
he
thought
would
enable
him
not
only
to
retrieve
his
liberty
but
also
indemnify
himself
for
the
mortification
he
had
undergone
far
from
creating
any
domestic
disturbance
by
upbraiding
her
with
her
finesse
he
seemed
perfectly
well
pleased
with
his
acquisition
and
as
he
knew
her
void
of
any
principle
and
extremely
addicted
to
pleasure
he
chose
proper
occasions
to
insinuate
that
she
might
gratify
her
own
inclination
and
at
the
same
time
turn
her
beauty
to
good
account
she
joyfully
listened
to
these
remonstrances
and
in
consequence
of
their
mutual
agreement
she
repaired
to
bristol
spring
on
pretence
of
an
ill
state
of
health
accompanied
by
her
whom
they
did
not
think
proper
to
intrust
with
the
real
motive
of
her
journey
person
was
agreeable
and
his
finances
supposed
to
be
in
flourishing
order
therefore
she
selected
him
from
the
herd
of
gallants
as
a
proper
sacrifice
to
the
powers
which
she
adored
and
on
her
arrival
in
london
made
her
husband
acquainted
with
the
importance
of
her
conquest
trapwell
overwhelmed
her
with
caresses
and
praise
for
her
discreet
and
dutiful
conduct
and
faithfully
promised
that
she
should
pocket
in
her
own
privy
purse
of
the
spoils
that
should
be
gathered
from
her
gallant
whom
she
therefore
undertook
to
betray
after
he
had
swore
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
his
intention
was
not
to
bring
the
affair
to
a
public
trial
which
would
redound
to
his
own
disgrace
but
to
extort
a
round
sum
of
money
from
the
count
by
way
of
composition
confiding
in
this
protestation
she
in
a
few
days
gave
him
intelligence
of
an
assignation
she
had
made
with
our
adventurer
at
a
certain
bagnio
near
covent
garden
upon
which
he
secured
the
assistance
of
a
particular
friend
and
his
own
journeyman
with
whom
and
a
constable
he
repaired
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
where
he
waited
in
an
adjoining
room
according
to
the
directions
of
his
virtuous
spouse
until
she
made
the
preconcerted
signal
of
hemming
three
times
aloud
when
he
and
his
associates
rushed
into
the
chamber
and
surprised
our
hero
in
bed
with
his
inamorata
the
lady
on
this
occasion
acted
her
part
to
a
miracle
she
screamed
at
their
approach
and
after
an
exclamation
of
ruined
and
undone
fainted
away
in
the
arms
of
her
spouse
who
had
by
this
time
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
begun
to
upbraid
her
with
her
infidelity
and
guilt
as
for
fathom
his
affliction
was
unutterable
when
he
found
himself
discovered
in
that
situation
and
made
prisoner
by
the
two
assistants
who
had
pinioned
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
stir
much
less
accomplish
an
escape
all
his
ingenuity
and
presence
of
mind
seemed
to
forsake
him
in
this
emergency
the
horrors
of
an
english
jury
overspread
his
imagination
for
he
at
once
perceived
that
the
toil
into
which
he
had
fallen
was
laid
for
the
purpose
consequently
he
took
it
for
granted
that
there
would
be
no
deficiency
in
point
of
evidence
soon
as
he
recollected
himself
he
begged
that
no
violence
might
be
offered
to
his
person
and
entreated
the
husband
to
favour
him
with
a
conference
in
which
the
affair
might
be
compromised
without
prejudice
to
the
reputation
of
either
at
first
trapwell
breathed
nothing
but
implacable
revenge
but
by
the
persuasion
of
his
friends
after
he
had
sent
home
his
wife
in
a
chair
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
hear
the
proposals
of
the
delinquent
who
having
assured
him
by
way
of
apology
that
he
had
always
believed
the
lady
was
a
widow
made
him
an
offer
of
five
hundred
pounds
as
an
atonement
for
the
injury
he
had
sustained
this
being
a
sum
no
ways
adequate
to
the
expectation
of
the
citizen
who
looked
upon
the
count
as
possessor
of
an
immense
estate
he
rejected
the
terms
with
disdain
and
made
instant
application
to
a
judge
from
whom
he
obtained
a
warrant
for
securing
his
person
till
the
day
of
trial
indeed
in
this
case
money
was
but
a
secondary
consideration
with
trapwell
whose
chief
aim
was
to
be
legally
divorced
from
a
woman
he
detested
therefore
there
was
no
remedy
for
the
unhappy
count
who
in
vain
offered
to
double
the
sum
he
found
himself
reduced
to
the
bitter
alternative
of
procuring
immediate
bail
or
going
directly
to
newgate
in
this
dilemma
he
sent
a
messenger
to
his
friend
ratchcali
whose
countenance
fell
when
he
understood
the
count
condition
nor
would
he
open
his
mouth
in
the
style
of
consolation
until
he
had
consulted
a
certain
solicitor
of
his
acquaintance
who
assured
him
the
law
abounded
with
such
resources
as
would
infallibly
screen
the
defendant
had
the
fact
been
still
more
palpable
than
it
was
he
said
there
was
great
presumption
to
believe
the
count
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
a
conspiracy
which
by
some
means
or
other
would
be
detected
and
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
might
obtain
one
shilling
in
lieu
of
damages
if
that
dependence
should
fail
he
hinted
that
in
all
probability
the
witnesses
were
not
incorruptible
or
should
they
prove
to
be
so
one
man
oath
was
as
good
as
another
and
thank
heaven
there
was
no
dearth
of
evidence
provided
money
could
be
found
to
answer
the
necessary
occasions
ratchcali
comforted
by
these
insinuations
and
dreading
the
resentment
of
our
adventurer
who
in
his
despair
might
punish
him
severely
for
his
want
of
friendship
by
some
precipitate
explanation
of
the
commerce
they
had
carried
on
moved
i
say
by
these
considerations
and
moreover
tempted
with
the
prospect
of
continuing
to
reap
the
advantages
resulting
from
their
conjunction
he
and
another
person
of
credit
with
whom
he
largely
dealt
in
jewels
condescended
to
become
sureties
for
the
appearance
of
fathom
who
was
accordingly
admitted
to
bail
not
but
that
the
tyrolese
knew
ferdinand
too
well
to
confide
in
his
parole
he
depended
chiefly
upon
his
ideas
of
which
he
thought
would
persuade
him
to
risk
the
uncertain
issue
of
a
trial
rather
than
quit
the
field
before
the
harvest
was
half
over
and
he
was
resolved
to
make
his
own
retreat
without
ceremony
should
our
hero
be
unwise
enough
to
abandon
his
bail
such
an
adventure
could
not
long
lie
concealed
from
the
notice
of
the
public
even
if
both
parties
had
been
at
pains
to
suppress
the
circumstances
but
the
plaintiff
far
from
seeking
to
cover
affected
to
complain
loudly
of
his
misfortune
that
he
might
interest
his
neighbours
in
his
behalf
and
raise
a
spirit
of
rancour
and
animosity
to
influence
the
jury
against
this
insolent
foreigner
who
had
come
over
into
england
to
debauch
our
wives
and
deflower
our
daughters
while
he
employed
a
formidable
band
of
lawyers
to
support
the
indictment
which
he
laid
at
ten
thousand
pounds
damages
meanwhile
fathom
and
his
associate
did
not
fail
to
take
all
proper
measures
for
his
defence
they
retained
a
powerful
bar
of
counsel
and
the
solicitor
was
supplied
with
one
hundred
pounds
after
another
to
answer
the
expense
of
secret
service
still
assuring
his
clients
that
everything
was
in
an
excellent
train
and
that
his
adversary
would
gain
nothing
but
shame
and
confusion
of
face
nevertheless
there
was
a
necessity
for
postponing
the
trial
on
account
of
a
material
evidence
who
though
he
wavered
was
not
yet
quite
brought
over
and
the
attorney
found
means
to
put
off
the
decision
from
term
to
term
until
there
was
no
quibble
left
for
further
delay
while
this
suit
was
depending
our
hero
continued
to
move
in
his
usual
sphere
nor
did
the
report
of
his
situation
at
all
operate
to
his
disadvantage
in
the
polite
world
on
the
contrary
it
added
a
fresh
plume
to
his
character
in
the
eyes
of
all
those
who
were
not
before
acquainted
with
the
triumphs
of
his
gallantry
notwithstanding
this
countenance
of
his
friends
he
himself
considered
the
affair
in
a
very
serious
light
and
perceiving
that
at
any
rate
he
must
be
a
considerable
loser
he
resolved
to
double
his
assiduity
in
trade
that
he
might
be
the
more
able
to
afford
the
extraordinary
expense
to
which
he
was
subjected
chapter
fresh
cause
for
exerting
his
equanimity
and
fortitude
the
reader
may
have
observed
that
fathom
with
all
his
circumspection
had
a
weak
side
which
exposed
him
to
sundry
mischances
this
was
his
covetousness
which
on
some
occasions
became
too
hard
for
his
discretion
at
this
period
of
time
it
was
by
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
inflamed
to
a
degree
of
rapacity
he
was
now
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
hand
at
whist
or
piquet
and
even
to
wield
the
though
he
had
hitherto
declared
himself
an
irreconcilable
enemy
to
all
sorts
of
play
and
so
uncommon
was
his
success
and
dexterity
at
these
exercises
as
to
surprise
his
acquaintance
and
arouse
the
suspicion
of
some
people
who
repined
at
his
prosperity
but
in
nothing
was
his
conduct
more
inexcusable
than
in
giving
way
to
the
dangerous
temerity
of
ratchcali
which
he
had
been
always
at
pains
to
restrain
and
permitting
him
to
practise
the
same
fraud
upon
an
english
nobleman
which
had
been
executed
upon
himself
at
frankfort
in
other
words
the
tyrolese
by
the
canal
of
ferdinand
finger
and
recommendation
sold
a
pebble
for
a
real
brilliant
and
in
a
few
days
the
cheat
was
discovered
to
the
infinite
confusion
of
our
adventurer
who
nevertheless
assumed
the
guise
of
innocence
with
so
much
art
and
expressed
such
indignation
against
the
villain
who
had
imposed
upon
his
judgment
and
unsuspecting
generosity
that
his
lordship
acquitted
him
of
any
share
in
the
deceit
and
contented
himself
with
the
restitution
which
he
insisted
upon
making
out
of
his
own
pocket
until
he
should
be
able
to
apprehend
the
rogue
who
had
thought
proper
to
abscond
for
his
own
safety
in
spite
of
all
this
exculpation
his
character
did
not
fail
to
retain
a
sort
of
stigma
which
indeed
the
plainest
proofs
of
innocence
are
hardly
able
to
efface
and
his
connexion
with
such
a
palpable
knave
as
the
tyrolese
appeared
to
be
had
an
effect
to
his
prejudice
in
the
minds
of
all
those
who
were
privy
to
the
occurrence
when
a
man
reputation
is
once
brought
in
question
every
trifle
is
by
the
malevolence
of
mankind
magnified
into
a
strong
presumption
against
the
culprit
a
few
whispers
communicated
by
the
envious
mouth
of
slander
which
he
can
have
no
opportunity
to
answer
and
refute
shall
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
convict
him
of
the
most
horrid
crimes
and
for
one
hypocrite
who
is
decked
with
the
honours
of
virtue
there
are
twenty
good
men
who
suffer
the
ignominy
of
vice
so
well
disposed
are
individuals
to
trample
upon
the
fame
of
their
if
the
most
unblemished
merit
is
not
protected
from
this
injustice
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
no
quarter
was
given
to
the
character
of
an
adventurer
like
fathom
who
among
other
unlucky
occurrences
had
the
misfortune
to
be
recognised
about
this
time
by
his
two
parisian
friends
sir
stentor
stile
and
sir
giles
squirrel
these
worthy
had
returned
to
their
own
country
after
having
made
a
very
prosperous
campaign
in
france
at
the
end
of
which
however
they
very
narrowly
escaped
the
galleys
and
seeing
the
polish
count
seated
at
the
head
of
taste
and
politeness
they
immediately
circulated
the
story
of
his
defeat
at
paris
with
many
ludicrous
circumstances
of
their
own
invention
and
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
he
was
a
rank
impostor
when
the
laugh
is
raised
upon
a
great
man
he
never
fails
to
dwindle
into
contempt
ferdinand
began
to
perceive
a
change
in
the
countenance
of
his
friends
his
company
was
no
longer
solicited
with
that
eagerness
which
they
had
formerly
expressed
in
his
behalf
even
his
entertainments
were
neglected
when
he
appeared
at
any
private
or
public
assembly
the
ladies
instead
of
glowing
with
pleasure
as
formerly
now
tittered
or
regarded
him
with
looks
of
disdain
and
a
certain
pert
little
forward
coquette
with
a
view
to
put
him
out
of
countenance
by
raising
the
laugh
at
his
expense
asked
him
one
night
at
a
drum
when
he
had
heard
from
his
relations
in
poland
she
succeeded
in
her
design
upon
the
mirth
of
the
audience
but
was
disappointed
in
the
other
part
of
her
aim
for
our
hero
replied
without
the
least
mark
of
discomposure
they
are
all
in
good
health
at
your
service
madam
i
wish
i
knew
in
what
part
of
the
world
your
relations
reside
that
i
might
return
the
by
this
answer
which
was
the
more
severe
as
the
young
lady
was
of
very
doubtful
extraction
he
retorted
the
laugh
upon
the
aggressor
though
he
likewise
failed
in
his
attempt
upon
her
temper
for
she
was
perhaps
the
only
person
present
who
equalled
himself
in
stability
of
countenance
notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
unconcern
he
was
deeply
touched
with
these
marks
of
alienation
in
the
behaviour
of
his
friends
and
foreseeing
in
his
own
disgrace
the
total
shipwreck
of
his
fortune
he
entered
into
a
melancholy
deliberation
with
himself
about
the
means
of
retrieving
his
importance
in
the
beau
monde
or
of
turning
his
address
into
some
other
channel
where
he
could
stand
upon
a
less
slippery
foundation
in
this
exercise
of
his
thoughts
no
scheme
occurred
more
feasible
than
that
of
securing
the
booty
he
had
made
and
retiring
with
his
associate
who
was
also
blown
into
some
other
country
where
their
names
and
characters
being
unknown
they
might
pursue
their
old
plan
of
commerce
without
molestation
he
imparted
this
suggestion
to
the
tyrolese
who
approved
the
proposal
of
decamping
though
he
combated
with
all
his
might
our
hero
inclination
to
withdraw
himself
before
the
trial
by
repeating
the
assurances
of
the
solicitor
who
told
him
he
might
depend
upon
being
reimbursed
by
the
sentence
of
the
court
for
great
part
of
the
sums
he
had
expended
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
fathom
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
these
arguments
supported
with
the
desire
of
making
an
honourable
retreat
and
waiting
patiently
for
the
day
of
trouble
discharged
his
sureties
by
a
personal
appearance
in
court
yet
this
was
not
the
only
score
he
discharged
that
morning
the
solicitor
presented
his
own
bill
before
they
set
out
for
westminster
hall
and
gave
the
count
to
understand
that
it
was
the
custom
from
time
immemorial
for
the
client
to
clear
with
his
attorney
before
trial
ferdinand
had
nothing
to
object
against
this
established
rule
though
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
bad
omen
in
spite
of
all
the
solicitor
confidence
and
protestations
and
he
was
not
a
little
confounded
when
looking
into
the
contents
he
found
himself
charged
with
attendances
he
knew
it
was
not
his
interest
to
disoblige
his
lawyer
at
such
a
juncture
nevertheless
he
could
not
help
expostulating
with
him
on
this
article
which
seemed
to
be
so
falsely
stated
with
regard
to
the
number
when
his
questions
drew
on
an
explanation
by
which
he
found
he
had
incurred
the
penalty
of
three
shillings
and
fourpence
for
every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
the
conscientious
attorney
either
in
the
park
the
or
the
street
provided
they
had
exchanged
the
common
salutation
and
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
the
solicitor
had
often
thrown
himself
in
his
way
with
a
view
to
swell
this
item
of
his
account
with
this
extortion
our
adventurer
was
fain
to
comply
because
he
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
caitiff
accordingly
he
with
a
good
grace
paid
the
demand
which
including
his
former
disbursements
amounted
to
three
hundred
and
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
threepence
three
farthings
and
then
presenting
himself
before
the
judge
quietly
submitted
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
his
counsel
behaved
like
men
of
consummate
abilities
in
their
profession
they
exerted
themselves
with
equal
industry
eloquence
and
erudition
in
their
endeavours
to
perplex
the
truth
browbeat
the
evidence
puzzle
the
judge
and
mislead
the
jury
but
the
defendant
found
himself
wofully
disappointed
in
the
deposition
of
trapwell
journeyman
whom
the
solicitor
pretended
to
have
converted
to
his
interest
this
witness
as
the
attorney
afterwards
declared
played
booty
and
the
facts
came
out
so
clear
that
ferdinand
count
fathom
was
convicted
of
criminal
conversation
with
the
plaintiff
wife
and
cast
in
fifteen
hundred
pounds
under
the
denomination
of
damages
he
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
afflicted
at
this
decision
because
he
saw
it
gradually
approaching
from
the
examination
of
the
first
evidence
his
thoughts
were
now
employed
in
casting
about
for
some
method
of
deliverance
from
the
snare
in
which
he
found
himself
entangled
to
escape
he
foresaw
it
would
be
impracticable
as
trapwell
would
undoubtedly
be
prepared
for
arresting
him
before
he
could
quit
westminster
hall
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
ratchcali
principles
to
expect
any
assistance
from
that
quarter
in
money
matters
and
he
was
utterly
averse
to
the
payment
of
the
sum
awarded
against
him
which
would
have
exhausted
his
whole
fortune
he
therefore
resolved
to
try
the
friendship
of
some
persons
of
fashion
with
whom
he
had
maintained
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
should
they
fail
him
in
the
day
of
his
necessity
he
proposed
to
have
recourse
to
his
former
sureties
one
of
whom
he
meant
to
bilk
while
the
other
might
accompany
him
in
his
retreat
or
should
both
these
expedients
miscarry
he
determined
rather
than
part
with
his
effects
to
undergo
the
most
disagreeable
confinement
in
hope
of
obtaining
the
jailor
connivance
at
his
escape
these
resolutions
being
taken
he
met
his
fate
with
great
fortitude
and
equanimity
and
calmly
suffered
himself
to
be
conveyed
to
the
house
of
a
sheriff
officer
who
as
he
made
his
exit
from
the
hall
according
to
his
own
expectation
executed
a
writ
against
him
at
the
suit
of
trapwell
for
a
debt
of
two
thousand
pounds
to
this
place
he
was
followed
by
his
solicitor
who
was
allured
by
the
prospect
of
another
job
and
who
with
great
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
congratulated
him
upon
the
happy
issue
of
the
trial
arrogating
to
himself
the
merit
of
having
saved
him
eight
thousand
pounds
in
the
article
of
damages
by
the
previous
steps
he
had
taken
and
the
noble
defence
that
he
and
his
friends
the
counsel
had
made
for
their
client
he
even
hinted
an
expectation
of
receiving
a
gratuity
for
his
extraordinary
care
and
discretion
fathom
galled
as
he
was
with
his
misfortune
and
enraged
at
the
effrontery
of
this
pettifogger
maintained
a
serenity
of
countenance
and
sent
the
attorney
with
a
message
to
the
plaintiff
importing
that
as
he
was
a
foreigner
and
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
so
much
cash
about
him
as
to
spare
fifteen
hundred
pounds
from
the
funds
of
his
ordinary
expense
he
would
grant
him
a
bond
payable
in
two
months
during
which
period
he
should
be
able
to
procure
a
proper
remittance
from
his
own
estate
while
the
solicitor
was
employed
in
this
negotiation
he
despatched
his
to
one
nobleman
and
maurice
to
another
with
billets
signifying
the
nature
of
the
verdict
which
his
adversary
had
obtained
and
desiring
that
each
would
lend
him
a
thousand
pounds
upon
his
parole
until
he
could
negotiate
bills
upon
the
continent
his
three
messengers
returned
almost
at
the
same
instant
of
time
and
these
were
the
answers
they
brought
back
trapwell
absolutely
rejected
his
personal
security
and
threatened
him
with
all
the
horrors
of
a
jail
unless
he
would
immediately
discharge
the
debt
or
procure
sufficient
bondsmen
and
one
of
his
quality
friends
favoured
him
with
this
reply
to
his
request
my
dear
count
i
am
mortally
chagrined
at
the
triumph
you
have
furnished
to
that
rascally
citizen
by
the
lard
the
judge
must
have
been
in
the
terrors
of
cuckoldom
to
influence
the
decision
and
the
jury
a
mere
herd
of
horned
beasts
to
bring
in
such
a
barbarous
verdict
egad
at
this
rate
no
gentleman
will
be
able
to
lie
with
another
wife
but
at
the
risk
of
a
cursed
prosecution
but
to
waive
this
disagreeable
circumstance
which
you
must
strive
to
forget
i
declare
my
mortification
is
still
the
greater
because
i
can
not
at
present
supply
you
with
the
trifle
your
present
exigency
requires
for
to
tell
you
a
secret
my
own
finances
are
in
damnable
confusion
but
a
man
of
count
fathom
figure
and
address
can
never
be
puzzled
for
the
want
of
such
a
paltry
sum
adieu
my
dear
count
we
shall
i
suppose
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
white
meanwhile
i
have
the
honour
to
be
with
the
most
perfect
attachment
yours
the
other
noble
peer
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
on
this
occasion
cherished
the
same
sentiments
of
virtue
friendship
and
generosity
but
his
expression
was
so
different
that
we
shall
for
the
edification
of
the
reader
transcribe
his
letter
in
his
own
words
sir
i
was
never
more
astonished
than
at
the
receipt
of
your
very
extraordinary
billet
wherein
you
solicit
the
loan
of
a
thousand
pounds
which
you
desire
may
be
sent
with
the
bearer
on
the
faith
of
your
parole
sir
i
have
no
money
to
send
you
or
lend
you
and
can
not
help
repeating
my
expressions
of
surprise
at
your
confidence
in
making
such
a
strange
and
unwarranted
demand
is
true
i
may
have
made
professions
of
friendship
while
i
looked
upon
you
as
a
person
of
honour
and
good
morals
but
now
that
you
are
convicted
of
such
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
laws
of
that
kingdom
where
you
have
been
treated
with
such
hospitality
and
respect
i
think
myself
fully
absolved
from
any
such
conditional
promise
which
indeed
is
never
interpreted
into
any
other
than
a
bare
compliment
i
am
sorry
you
have
involved
your
character
and
fortune
in
such
a
disagreeable
affair
and
am
sir
yours
etc
ferdinand
was
not
such
a
novice
in
the
world
as
to
be
disappointed
at
these
repulses
especially
as
he
had
laid
very
little
stress
upon
the
application
which
was
made
by
way
of
an
experiment
upon
the
gratitude
or
caprice
of
those
two
noblemen
whom
he
had
actually
more
than
once
obliged
with
the
same
sort
of
assistance
which
he
now
solicited
though
not
to
such
a
considerable
amount
having
nothing
further
to
expect
from
the
fashionable
world
he
sent
the
tyrolese
to
the
person
who
had
been
bail
for
his
appearance
with
full
instructions
to
explain
his
present
occasion
in
the
most
favourable
light
and
desire
he
would
reinforce
the
credit
of
the
count
with
his
security
but
that
gentleman
though
he
placed
the
most
perfect
confidence
on
the
honour
of
our
hero
and
would
have
willingly
entered
into
bonds
again
for
his
personal
appearance
was
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
of
his
circumstances
as
to
become
liable
for
the
payment
of
two
thousand
pounds
an
expense
which
in
his
opinion
the
finances
of
no
foreign
count
were
able
to
defray
he
therefore
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
the
most
pressing
remonstrances
of
the
ambassador
who
had
recourse
to
several
other
merchants
with
the
same
bad
success
so
that
the
prisoner
despairing
of
bail
endeavoured
to
persuade
ratchcali
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
contribute
a
thousand
pounds
towards
his
discharge
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
quit
england
with
a
good
grace
and
execute
his
part
of
the
plan
they
had
projected
so
powerful
was
his
eloquence
on
the
occasion
and
such
strength
of
argument
did
he
use
that
even
the
tyrolese
seemed
convinced
though
reluctantly
and
agreed
to
advance
the
necessary
sum
upon
the
bond
and
judgment
of
our
adventurer
who
being
disabled
from
transacting
his
own
affairs
in
person
was
obliged
to
intrust
ratchcali
with
his
keys
papers
and
power
of
attorney
under
the
check
and
inspection
of
his
faithful
maurice
and
the
solicitor
whose
fidelity
he
bespoke
with
the
promise
of
an
ample
recompense
chapter
the
biter
is
bit
yet
he
had
no
sooner
committed
his
effects
to
the
care
of
this
triumvirate
than
his
fancy
was
visited
with
direful
warnings
which
produced
cold
sweats
and
palpitations
and
threw
him
into
such
agonies
of
apprehension
as
he
had
never
known
before
he
remembered
the
former
desertion
of
the
tyrolese
the
recent
villany
of
the
solicitor
and
recollected
the
remarks
he
had
made
upon
the
disposition
and
character
of
his
valet
which
evinced
him
a
fit
companion
for
the
other
two
alarmed
at
these
reflections
he
entreated
the
bailiff
to
indulge
him
with
a
visit
to
his
own
lodgings
and
even
offered
one
hundred
guineas
as
a
gratification
for
his
compliance
but
the
officer
who
had
formerly
lost
a
considerable
sum
by
the
escape
of
a
prisoner
would
not
run
any
risk
in
an
affair
of
such
consequence
and
our
hero
was
obliged
to
submit
to
the
tortures
of
his
own
presaging
fears
after
he
had
waited
five
hours
in
the
most
racking
impatience
he
saw
the
attorney
enter
with
all
the
marks
of
hurry
fatigue
and
consternation
and
heard
him
exclaim
good
god
have
you
seen
the
gentleman
fathom
found
his
fears
realised
in
this
interrogation
to
which
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
horror
and
dismay
what
gentleman
i
suppose
i
am
robbed
speak
and
keep
me
no
longer
in
robbed
cried
the
attorney
the
lord
forbid
i
hope
you
can
depend
upon
the
person
you
empowered
to
receive
your
jewels
and
cash
i
must
own
his
proceedings
are
a
little
extraordinary
for
after
he
had
rummaged
your
scrutoire
from
which
in
presence
of
me
and
your
servant
he
took
one
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
a
parcel
of
diamond
rings
and
buckles
according
to
this
here
inventory
which
i
wrote
with
my
own
hand
and
east
india
bonds
to
the
tune
of
five
hundred
more
we
adjourned
to
garraway
where
he
left
me
alone
under
pretence
of
going
to
a
broker
of
his
acquaintance
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
while
the
valet
as
i
imagined
waited
for
us
in
the
alley
well
sir
he
stayed
so
long
that
i
began
to
be
uneasy
and
at
length
resolved
to
send
the
servant
in
quest
of
him
but
when
i
went
out
for
that
purpose
deuce
a
servant
was
to
be
found
though
i
in
person
inquired
for
him
at
every
alehouse
within
half
a
mile
of
the
place
i
then
despatched
no
less
than
five
ticket
porters
upon
the
scent
after
them
and
i
myself
by
a
direction
from
the
went
to
signior
ratchcali
lodgings
where
as
they
told
me
he
had
not
been
seen
since
nine
in
the
morning
upon
this
intimation
i
came
directly
hither
to
give
you
timely
notice
that
you
may
without
delay
take
measures
for
your
own
security
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
take
out
writs
for
apprehending
him
in
the
counties
of
middlesex
surrey
kent
and
essex
and
i
shall
put
them
in
the
hands
of
trusty
and
diligent
officers
who
will
soon
ferret
him
out
of
his
provided
he
skulks
within
ten
miles
of
the
bills
of
mortality
to
be
sure
the
job
will
be
expensive
and
all
these
runners
must
be
paid
beforehand
but
what
then
the
defendant
is
worth
powder
and
if
we
can
once
secure
him
i
warrant
the
prosecution
will
quit
fathom
was
almost
choked
with
concern
and
resentment
at
the
news
of
this
mischance
so
that
he
could
not
utter
one
word
until
this
narrative
was
finished
nor
was
his
suspicion
confined
to
the
tyrolese
and
his
own
lacquey
he
considered
the
solicitor
as
their
accomplice
and
director
and
was
so
much
provoked
at
the
latter
part
of
his
harangue
that
his
discretion
seemed
to
vanish
and
collaring
the
attorney
villain
said
he
you
yourself
have
been
a
principal
actor
in
this
then
turning
to
the
bystanders
and
i
desire
in
the
king
name
that
he
may
be
secured
until
i
can
make
oath
before
a
magistrate
in
support
of
the
charge
if
you
refuse
your
assistance
in
detaining
him
i
will
make
immediate
application
to
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
who
is
my
particular
friend
and
he
will
see
justice
done
to
all
at
mention
of
this
formidable
name
the
bailiff
and
his
whole
family
were
in
commotion
to
obstruct
the
retreat
of
the
lawyer
who
stood
aghast
and
trembled
under
the
grasp
of
our
adventurer
but
soon
as
he
found
himself
delivered
from
this
embrace
by
the
interposition
of
the
spectators
and
collected
his
spirits
which
had
been
suddenly
dissipated
by
fathom
unexpected
assault
he
began
to
display
one
art
of
his
occupation
which
he
always
reserved
for
extraordinary
occasions
this
was
the
talent
of
abuse
which
he
poured
forth
with
such
fluency
of
opprobrious
language
that
our
hero
smarting
as
he
was
and
almost
desperate
with
his
loss
deviated
from
that
temperance
of
behaviour
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
and
snatching
up
the
poker
with
one
stroke
opened
a
deep
trench
upon
the
attorney
skull
that
extended
from
the
hind
head
almost
to
the
upper
part
of
the
nose
upon
each
side
of
which
it
discharged
a
sanguine
stream
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
this
application
the
solicitor
was
transported
with
joy
at
the
sense
of
the
smart
and
inwardly
congratulated
himself
upon
the
appearance
of
his
own
blood
which
he
no
sooner
perceived
than
he
exclaimed
i
a
dead
man
and
fell
upon
the
floor
at
full
length
immediate
recourse
was
had
to
a
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
who
having
examined
the
wound
declared
there
was
a
dangerous
depression
of
the
first
table
of
the
skull
and
that
if
he
could
save
the
patient
life
without
the
application
of
the
trepan
it
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
cures
that
ever
were
performed
by
this
time
fathom
first
transport
being
overblown
he
summoned
up
his
whole
resolution
and
reflected
upon
his
own
ruin
with
that
fortitude
which
had
never
failed
him
in
the
emergencies
of
his
fate
little
disturbed
at
the
prognostic
of
the
surgeon
which
he
considered
in
the
right
point
of
view
sir
said
he
i
am
not
so
unacquainted
with
the
resistance
of
an
attorney
skull
as
to
believe
the
chastisement
i
have
bestowed
on
him
will
at
all
endanger
his
life
which
is
in
much
greater
jeopardy
from
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
for
notwithstanding
this
accident
i
am
determined
to
prosecute
the
rascal
for
robbery
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
and
that
i
may
have
a
sufficient
fund
left
for
that
prosecution
i
shall
not
at
present
throw
away
one
farthing
in
unnecessary
expense
but
insist
upon
being
conveyed
to
prison
without
farther
this
declaration
was
equally
unwelcome
to
the
bailiff
surgeon
and
solicitor
who
upon
the
supposition
that
the
count
was
a
person
of
fortune
and
would
rather
part
with
an
immense
sum
than
incur
the
ignominy
of
a
jail
or
involve
himself
in
another
disgraceful
lawsuit
had
resolved
to
fleece
him
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
but
now
the
attorney
finding
him
determined
to
set
his
fate
at
defiance
and
to
retort
upon
him
a
prosecution
which
he
had
no
design
to
undergo
began
to
repent
heartily
of
the
provocation
he
had
given
and
to
think
seriously
on
some
method
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
incensed
foreigner
with
this
view
while
the
bailiff
conducted
him
to
bed
in
another
apartment
he
desired
the
catchpole
to
act
the
part
of
mediator
between
him
and
the
count
and
furnished
him
with
proper
instructions
for
that
purpose
accordingly
the
landlord
on
his
return
told
fathom
that
he
was
sure
the
solicitor
was
not
a
man
for
this
world
for
that
he
had
left
him
deprived
of
his
senses
and
praying
to
god
with
great
devotion
for
mercy
to
his
murderer
he
then
exhorted
him
with
many
protestations
of
friendship
to
compromise
the
unhappy
affair
by
exchanging
releases
with
the
attorney
before
his
delirium
should
be
known
otherwise
he
would
bring
himself
into
a
most
dangerous
premunire
whether
the
plaintiff
should
die
of
his
wound
or
live
to
prosecute
him
for
assault
and
with
regard
to
your
charge
of
robbery
against
him
said
he
as
it
is
no
more
than
a
base
suspicion
unsupported
by
the
least
shadow
of
evidence
the
bill
would
be
thrown
out
and
then
he
might
sue
you
for
damages
i
therefore
out
of
pure
friendship
and
advise
you
to
compromise
the
affair
and
if
you
think
proper
will
endeavour
to
bring
about
a
mutual
our
hero
whose
passion
was
by
this
time
pretty
well
cooled
saw
reason
for
assenting
to
the
proposal
upon
which
the
deed
was
immediately
executed
the
mediator

was
discharged

after
he
had
empowered
his
own
landlord
to
discharge

and

effects
into

money
thus
he
saw
himself
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
deprived
of
his
reputation
rank
liberty
and
friends
and
his
fortune
reduced

chapter
our
adventurer
is
made
acquainted
with
a
new
scene
of
life
just
as
he
entered
these
mansions
of
misery
his
ears
were
invaded
with
a
hoarse
and
dreadful
voice
exclaiming
you
bess
beetle
score
a
couple
of
fresh
eggs
a
pennyworth
of

and
half
a

the
fat
widow
gentlewoman
from

has
promised
to
quit
his
score
sir
mungo
barebones
may
have
some
hasty
pudding
and
small
beer
though
i
do
expect
to
see
his
coin
no
more
than
to
receive
the
eighteen
pence
i
laid
out
for
a
pair
of
breeches
to
his
backside
what
then
he
a
quiet
sort
of
a
body
and
a
great
scholar
and
it
was
a
scandal
to
the
place
to
see
him
going
about
in
that
naked
condition
as
for
the
mad
frenchman
with
the
beard
if
you
give
him
so
much
as
a
you
b
ch
i
send
you
back
to
the
hole
among
your
old
companions
an
impudent
dog
i
teach
him
to
draw
his
sword
upon
the
governor
of
an
english
county
jail
what
i
suppose
he
thought
he
had
to
do
with
a
french
rabbit
him
he
shall
eat
his
white
feather
before
i
give
him
credit
for
a
morsel
of
although
our
adventurer
was
very
little
disposed
at
this
juncture
to
make
observations
foreign
to
his
own
affairs
he
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
these
extraordinary
injunctions
especially
those
concerning
the
person
who
was
entitled
king
whom
however
he
supposed
to
be
some
prisoner
elected
as
the
magistrate
by
the
joint
suffrage
of
his
fellows
having
taken
possession
of
his
chamber
which
he
rented
at
five
shillings
a
week
and
being
ill
at
ease
in
his
own
thoughts
he
forthwith
secured
his
door
undressed
and
went
to
bed
in
which
though
it
was
none
of
the
most
elegant
or
inviting
couches
he
enjoyed
profound
repose
after
the
accumulated
fatigues
and
mortifications
of
the
day
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
keeper
entered
his
apartment
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
gentlemen
under
his
care
having
heard
of
the
count
arrival
had
deputed
one
of
their
number
to
wait
upon
him
with
the
compliments
of
condolence
suitable
to
the
occasion
and
invite
him
to
become
a
member
of
their
society
our
hero
could
not
politely
dispense
with
this
instance
of
civility
and
their
ambassador
being
instantly
introduced
by
the
name
of
captain
minikin
saluted
him
with
great
solemnity
this
was
a
person
equally
remarkable
for
his
extraordinary
figure
and
address
his
age
seemed
to
border
upon
forty
his
stature
amounted
to
five
feet
his
visage
was
long
meagre
and
and
his
aspect
though
not
quite
rueful
exhibited
a
certain
formality
which
was
the
result
of
care
and
conscious
importance
he
was
very
little
encumbered
with
flesh
and
blood
yet
what
body
he
had
was
well
proportioned
his
limbs
were
elegantly
turned
and
by
his
carriage
he
was
well
entitled
to
that
compliment
which
we
pay
to
any
person
when
we
say
he
has
very
much
the
air
of
a
gentleman
there
was
also
an
evident
singularity
in
his
dress
which
though
intended
as
an
improvement
appeared
to
be
an
extravagant
exaggeration
of
the
mode
and
at
once
evinced
him
an
original
to
the
discerning
eyes
of
our
adventurer
who
received
him
with
his
usual
complaisance
and
made
a
very
eloquent
acknowledgment
of
the
honour
and
satisfaction
he
received
from
the
visit
of
the
representative
and
the
hospitality
of
his
constituents
the
captain
peculiarities
were
not
confined
to
his
external
appearance
for
his
voice
resembled
the
sound
of
a
bassoon
or
the
aggregate
hum
of
a
whole
and
his
discourse
was
almost
nothing
else
than
a
series
of
quotations
from
the
english
poets
interlarded
with
french
phrases
which
he
retained
for
their
significance
on
the
recommendation
of
his
friends
being
himself
unacquainted
with
that
or
any
other
outlandish
tongue
fathom
finding
this
gentleman
of
a
very
communicative
disposition
thought
he
could
not
have
a
fairer
opportunity
of
learning
the
history
of
his
and
turning
the
conversation
on
that
subject
was
not
disappointed
in
his
expectation
i
do
doubt
sir
said
he
with
the
utmost
solemnity
of
declamation
but
you
look
with
horror
upon
every
object
that
surrounds
you
in
this
uncomfortable
place
but
nevertheless
here
are
some
who
as
my
friend
shakespeare
has
it
have
seen
better
days
and
have
with
holy
bell
been
knolled
to
church
and
sat
at
good
men
feasts
and
wiped
their
eyes
of
drops
that
sacred
pity
hath
engendered
you
must
know
sir
that
exclusive
of
the
canaille
or
the
profanum
vulgus
as
they
are
styled
by
horace
there
are
several
small
communities
in
the
jail
consisting
of
people
who
are
attracted
by
the
manners
and
dispositions
of
each
other
for
this
place
sir
is
quite
a
microcosm
and
as
the
great
world
so
is
this
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
for
my
own
part
sir
i
have
always
made
it
a
maxim
to
associate
with
the
best
of
company
i
can
find
not
that
i
pretend
to
boast
of
my
family
or
extraction
because
you
know
as
the
poet
says
vix
ea
nostra
voco
my
father
is
true
was
a
man
that
piqued
himself
upon
his
pedigree
as
well
as
upon
his
politesse
and
personal
merit
for
he
had
been
a
very
old
officer
in
the
army
and
i
myself
may
say
i
was
born
with
a
spontoon
in
my
hand
sir
i
have
had
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
these
twenty
years
and
have
been
bandied
about
in
the
course
of
duty
through
all
the
british
plantations
and
you
see
the
recompense
of
all
my
service
but
this
is
a
disagreeable
subject
and
therefore
i
shall
waive
it
however
as
butler
observes
my
only
comfort
is
that
now
my
dubbolt
fortune
is
so
low
that
either
it
must
quickly
end
or
turn
about
again
and
mend
and
now
to
return
from
this
digression
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
head
or
chairman
of
our
club
is
really
a
sovereign
prince
no
less
i
assure
you
than
the
celebrated
theodore
king
of
corsica
who
lies
in
prison
for
a
debt
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
heu
quantum
mutatus
ab
illo
it
is
not
my
business
to
censure
the
conduct
of
my
superiors
but
i
always
speak
my
mind
in
a
cavalier
manner
and
as
according
to
the
spectator
talking
to
a
friend
is
no
more
than
thinking
aloud
entre
nous
his
corsican
majesty
has
been
scurvily
treated
by
a
certain
administration
be
that
as
it
will
he
is
a
personage
of
a
very
portly
appearance
and
is
quite
master
of
the
bienseance
besides
they
will
find
it
their
interest
to
have
recourse
again
to
his
alliance
and
in
that
case
some
of
us
may
expect
to
profit
by
his
restoration
but
few
words
are
best
he
that
maintains
the
second
rank
in
our
assembly
is
one
major
macleaver
an
irish
gentleman
who
has
served
abroad
a
soldier
of
fortune
sir
a
man
of
unquestionable
honour
and
courage
but
a
little
overbearing
in
consequence
of
his
knowledge
and
experience
he
is
a
person
of
good
address
to
be
sure
and
quite
free
of
the
mauvaise
honte
and
he
may
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
but
what
then
other
people
may
be
as
good
as
he
though
they
have
not
had
such
opportunities
if
he
speaks
five
or
six
languages
he
does
not
pretend
to
any
taste
in
the
liberal
arts
which
are
the
criterion
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
the
next
is
sir
mungo
barebones
the
representative
of
a
very
ancient
family
in
the
north
his
affairs
are
very
much
deranged
but
he
is
a
gentleman
of
great
probity
and
learning
and
at
present
engaged
in
a
very
grand
scheme
which
if
he
can
bring
it
to
bear
will
render
him
famous
to
all
posterity
no
less
than
the
conversion
of
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
the
project
i
own
looks
chimerical
to
one
who
has
not
conversed
with
the
author
but
in
my
opinion
he
has
clearly
demonstrated
from
an
anagrammatical
analysis
of
a
certain
hebrew
word
that
his
present
majesty
whom
god
preserve
is
the
person
pointed
at
in
scripture
as
the
temporal
messiah
of
the
jews
and
if
he
could
once
raise
by
subscription
such
a
trifling
sum
as
twelve
hundred
thousand
pounds
i
make
no
doubt
but
he
would
accomplish
his
aim
vast
and
romantic
as
it
seems
to
be
besides
these
we
have
another
messmate
who
is
a
french
chevalier
an
odd
sort
of
a
man
a
kind
of
lazarillo
de
tormes
a
caricatura
he
wears
a
long
beard
pretends
to
be
a
great
poet
and
makes
a
d
fracas
with
his
verses
the
king
has
been
obliged
to
exert
his
authority
over
him
more
than
once
by
ordering
him
into
close
confinement
for
which
he
was
so
rash
as
to
send
his
majesty
a
challenge
but
he
afterwards
made
his
submission
and
was
again
taken
into
favour
the
truth
is
i
believe
his
brain
is
a
little
disordered
and
he
being
a
stranger
we
overlook
his
extravagancies
sir
we
shall
think
ourselves
happy
in
your
accession
to
our
society
you
will
be
under
no
sort
of
restraint
for
though
we
dine
at
one
table
every
individual
calls
and
pays
for
his
own
mess
our
conversation
such
as
it
is
will
not
i
hope
be
disagreeable
and
though
we
have
not
opportunities
of
breathing
the
pure
arcadian
air
and
can
not
the
shade
of
melancholy
boughs
lose
and
neglect
the
creeping
hours
of
time
we
may
enjoy
ourselves
over
a
glass
of
punch
or
a
dish
of
tea
nor
are
we
destitute
of
friends
who
visit
us
in
these
shades
of
distress
the
major
has
a
numerous
acquaintance
of
both
sexes
among
others
a
first
cousin
of
good
fortune
who
with
her
daughters
often
cheer
our
solitude
she
is
a
very
sensible
ladylike
gentlewoman
and
the
young
ladies
have
a
certain
degagee
air
that
plainly
shows
they
have
seen
the
best
company
besides
i
will
venture
to
recommend
minikin
as
a
woman
of
tolerable
breeding
and
capacity
who
i
hope
will
not
be
found
altogether
deficient
in
the
accomplishments
of
the
sex
so
that
we
find
means
to
make
little
parties
in
which
the
time
glides
away
insensibly
then
i
have
a
small
collection
of
books
which
are
at
your
service
you
may
amuse
yourself
with
shakespeare
or
milton
or
don
quixote
or
any
of
our
modern
authors
that
are
worth
reading
such
as
the
adventures
of
loveill
lady
frail
george
edwards
joe
thompson
bampfylde
moore
carew
young
scarron
and
miss
betsy
thoughtless
and
if
you
have
a
taste
for
drawing
i
can
entertain
you
with
a
parcel
of
prints
by
the
best
a
man
of
our
hero
politeness
could
not
help
expressing
himself
in
the
warmest
terms
of
gratitude
for
this
courteous
declaration
he
thanked
the
captain
in
particular
for
his
obliging
offers
and
begged
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
present
his
respects
to
the
society
of
which
he
longed
to
be
a
member
it
was
determined
therefore
that
minikin
should
return
in
an
hour
when
the
count
would
be
dressed
in
order
to
conduct
him
into
the
presence
of
his
majesty
and
he
had
already
taken
his
leave
for
the
present
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
came
back
and
taking
hold
of
a
waistcoat
that
lay
upon
a
chair
sir
said
he
give
me
leave
to
look
at
that
fringe
i
think
it
is
the
most
elegant
knitting
i
ever
saw
but
pray
sir
are
not
these
quite
out
of
fashion
i
thought
plain
silk
such
as
this
that
i
wear
had
been
the
mode
with
the
pockets
very
before
fathom
had
time
to
make
any
sort
of
reply
he
took
notice
of
his
hat
and
pumps
the
first
of
which
he
said
was
too
narrow
in
the
brims
and
the
last
an
inch
too
low
in
the
heels
indeed
they
formed
a
remarkable
contrast
with
his
own
for
exclusive
of
the
fashion
of
the
cock
which
resembled
the
form
of
a
roman
galley
the
brim
of
his
hat
if
properly
spread
would
have
projected
a
shade
sufficient
to
shelter
a
whole
file
of
musketeers
from
the
heat
of
a
summer
sun
and
the
heels
of
his
shoes
were
so
high
as
to
raise
his
feet
three
inches
at
least
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
having
made
these
observations
for
the
credit
of
his
taste
he
retired
and
returning
at
the
time
appointed
accompanied
ferdinand
to
the
apartment
of
the
king
at
the
doors
of
which
their
ears
were
invaded
with
a
strange
sound
being
that
of
a
human
voice
imitating
the
noise
of
a
drum
the
captain
hearing
this
alarm
made
a
full
stop
and
giving
the
count
to
understand
that
his
majesty
was
busy
begged
he
would
not
take
it
amiss
if
the
introduction
should
be
delayed
for
a
few
moments
fathom
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
heard
applied
to
his
guide
for
information
and
learned
that
the
king
and
the
major
whom
he
had
nominated
to
the
post
of
his
were
employed
in
landing
troops
upon
the
genoese
territory
that
is
that
they
were
settling
beforehand
the
manner
of
their
disembarkation
he
then
by
the
direction
of
his
conductor
reconnoitred
them
through
the
keyhole
and
perceived
the
sovereign
and
his
minister
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
a
deal
board
table
covered
with
a
large
chart
or
map
upon
which
he
saw
a
great
number
of
mussel
and
oyster
shells
ranged
in
a
certain
order
and
at
a
little
distance
several
regular
squares
and
columns
made
of
cards
cut
in
small
pieces
the
prince
himself
whose
eyes
were
reinforced
by
spectacles
surveyed
this
armament
with
great
attention
while
the
general
put
the
whole
in
action
and
conducted
their
motions
by
beat
of
drum
the
according
to
explanation
represented
the
transports
the
were
considered
as
the
that
covered
the
troops
in
landing
and
the
pieces
of
card
exhibited
the
different
bodies
into
which
the
army
was
formed
upon
its
disembarkation
as
an
affair
of
such
consequence
could
not
be
transacted
without
opposition
they
had
provided
divers
ambuscades
consisting
of
the
enemy
whom
they
represented
by
grey
peas
and
accordingly
general
macleaver
perceiving
the
said
grey
peas
marching
along
shore
to
attack
his
forces
before
they
could
be
drawn
up
in
battalia
thus
addressed
himself
to
the
in
an
audible
voice
you
do
you
see
the
front
of
the
enemy
advancing
and
the
rest
of
the
detachment
following
out
of
sight
arrah
the
devil
burn
you
why
do
you
come
ashore
and
open
your
batteries
so
saying
he
pushed
the
shells
towards
the
breach
performed
the
cannonading
with
his
voice
the
grey
peas
were
soon
put
in
confusion
the
general
was
beat
the
cards
marched
forwards
in
order
of
battle
and
the
enemy
having
retreated
with
great
precipitation
they
took
possession
of
their
ground
without
farther
difficulty
chapter

he
contemplates
majesty
and
its
satellites
in
eclipse
this
expedition
being
happily
finished
general
macleaver
put
the
whole
army
navy
transports
and
scene
of
action
into
a
canvas
bag
the
prince
unsaddled
his
nose
and
captain
minikin
being
admitted
our
hero
was
introduced
in
form
very
gracious
was
the
reception
he
met
with
from
his
majesty
who
with
a
most
princely
demeanour
welcomed
him
to
court
and
even
seated
him
on
his
right
hand
in
token
of
particular
regard
true
it
is
this
was
not
so
superb
nor
the
appearance
of
the
king
so
magnificent
as
to
render
such
an
honour
intoxicating
to
any
person
of
our
hero
coolness
and
discretion
in
lieu
of
tapestry
the
apartment
was
hung
with
halfpenny
ballads
a
without
curtains
supplied
the
place
of
a
canopy
and
instead
of
a
crown
his
majesty
wore
a
woollen
yet
in
spite
of
these
disadvantages
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
in
his
deportment
and
a
nice
physiognomist
would
have
perceived
something
majestic
in
the
features
of
his
countenance
he
was
certainly
a
personage
of
very
prepossessing
mien
his
manners
were
engaging
his
conversation
agreeable
and
any
man
whose
heart
was
subject
to
the
meltings
of
humanity
would
have
deplored
his
distress
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
most
pathetic
instance
of
that
miserable
reverse
to
which
all
human
grandeur
is
exposed
his
fall
was
even
greater
than
that
of
belisarius
who
after
having
obtained
many
glorious
victories
over
the
enemies
of
his
country
is
said
to
have
been
reduced
to
such
extremity
of
indigence
that
in
his
old
age
when
he
was
deprived
of
his
eyesight
he
sat
upon
the
highway
like
a
common
mendicant
imploring
the
charity
of
passengers
in
the
piteous
exclamation
of
date
obolum
belisario
that
is
spare
a
farthing
to
your
poor
old
soldier
i
say
this
general
disgrace
was
not
so
remarkable
as
that
of
theodore
because
he
was
the
servant
of
justinian
consequently
his
fortune
depended
upon
the
nod
of
that
emperor
whereas
the
other
actually
possessed
the
throne
of
sovereignty
by
the
best
of
all
titles
namely
the
unanimous
election
of
the
people
over
whom
he
reigned
and
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
europe
by
the
efforts
he
made
in
breaking
the
bands
of
oppression
and
vindicating
that
liberty
which
is
the
birthright
of
man
the
english
of
former
days
alike
renowned
for
generosity
and
valour
treated
those
hostile
princes
whose
fate
it
was
to
wear
their
chains
with
such
delicacy
of
benevolence
as
even
dispelled
the
horrors
of
captivity
but
their
posterity
of
this
refined
age
feel
no
compunction
at
seeing
an
unfortunate
monarch
their
former
friend
ally
and
partisan
languish
amidst
the
miseries
of
a
loathsome
jail
for
a
paltry
debt
contracted
in
their
own
service
but
moralising
apart
our
hero
had
not
long
conversed
with
this
extraordinary
debtor
who
in
his
present
condition
assumed
no
other
title
than
that
of
baron
than
he
perceived
in
him
a
spirit
of
quixotism
which
all
his
experience
together
with
the
vicissitudes
of
his
fortune
had
not
been
able
to
overcome
not
that
his
ideas
soared
to
such
a
pitch
of
extravagant
hope
as
that
which
took
possession
of
his
messmates
who
frequently
quarrelled
one
with
another
about
the
degrees
of
favour
to
which
they
should
be
entitled
after
the
king
restoration
but
he
firmly
believed
that
affairs
would
speedily
take
such
a
turn
in
italy
as
would
point
out
to
the
english
court
the
expediency
of
employing
him
again
and
his
persuasion
seemed
to
support
him
against
every
species
of
poverty
and
mortification
while
they
were
busy
in
trimming
the
balance
of
power
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
their
deliberations
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
scullion
who
came
to
receive
their
orders
touching
the
bill
of
fare
for
dinner
and
his
majesty
found
much
more
difficulty
in
settling
this
important
concern
than
in
compromising
all
the
differences
between
the
emperor
and
the
queen
of
spain
at
length
however
general
macleaver
undertook
the
office
of
purveyor
for
his
prince
captain
minikin
insisted
upon
treating
the
count
and
in
a
little
time
the
table
was
covered
with
a
cloth
which
for
the
sake
of
my
delicate
readers
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
at
this
period
they
were
joined
by
sir
mungo
barebones
who
having
found
means
to
purchase
a
couple
of
mutton
chops
had
cooked
a
mess
of
broth
which
he
now
brought
in
a
saucepan
to
the
general
rendezvous
this
was
the
most
remarkable
object
which
had
hitherto
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
fathom
being
naturally
of
a
meagre
habit
he
was
by
indigence
and
hard
study
wore
almost
to
the
bone
and
so
bended
towards
the
earth
that
in
walking
his
body
described
at
least
degrees
of
a
circle
the
want
of
stockings
and
shoes
he
supplied
with
a
jockey
straight
boot
and
an
half
jack
his
thighs
and
middle
were
cased
in
a
monstrous
pair
of
brown
trunk
breeches
which
the
keeper
bought
for
his
use
from
the
executor
of
a
dutch
seaman
who
had
lately
died
in
the
jail
his
shirt
retained
no
signs
of
its
original
colour
his
body
was
shrouded
in
an
old
greasy
tattered
plaid
nightgown
a
blue
and
white
handkerchief
surrounded
his
head
and
his
looks
betokened
that
immense
load
of
care
which
he
had
voluntarily
incurred
for
the
eternal
salvation
of
sinners
yet
this
figure
uncouth
as
it
was
made
his
compliments
to
our
adventurer
in
terms
of
the
most
elegant
address
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
disclosed
a
great
fund
of
valuable
knowledge
he
had
appeared
in
the
great
world
and
borne
divers
offices
of
dignity
and
trust
with
universal
applause
his
courage
was
undoubted
his
morals
were
unimpeached
and
his
person
held
in
great
veneration
and
esteem
when
his
evil
genius
engaged
him
in
the
study
of
hebrew
and
the
mysteries
of
the
jewish
religion
which
fairly
disordered
his
brain
and
rendered
him
incapable
of
managing
his
temporal
affairs
when
he
ought
to
have
been
employed
in
the
functions
of
his
post
he
was
always
wrapt
in
visionary
conferences
with
moses
on
the
mount
rather
than
regulate
the
economy
of
his
household
he
chose
to
exert
his
endeavours
in
settling
the
precise
meaning
of
the
word
elohim
and
having
discovered
that
now
the
period
was
come
when
the
jews
and
gentiles
would
be
converted
he
postponed
every
other
consideration
in
order
to
facilitate
that
great
and
glorious
event
by
this
time
ferdinand
had
seen
every
member
of
the
club
except
the
french
chevalier
who
seemed
to
be
quite
neglected
by
the
society
for
his
name
was
not
once
mentioned
during
this
communication
and
they
sat
down
to
dinner
without
asking
whether
he
was
dead
or
alive
the
king
regaled
himself
with
a
plate
of
the
major
who
complained
that
his
appetite
had
forsaken
him
amused
himself
with
some
forty
hard
eggs
malaxed
with
salt
butter
the
knight
indulged
upon
his
soup
and
bouilli
and
the
captain
entertained
our
adventurer
with
a
neck
of
veal
roasted
with
potatoes
but
before
fathom
could
make
use
of
his
knife
and
fork
he
was
summoned
to
the
door
where
he
found
the
chevalier
in
great
agitation
his
eyes
sparkling
like
coals
of
fire
our
hero
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
apparition
who
having
asked
pardon
for
the
freedom
he
had
used
observed
that
understanding
the
count
was
a
foreigner
he
could
not
dispense
with
appealing
to
him
concerning
an
outrage
he
had
suffered
from
the
keeper
who
without
any
regard
to
his
rank
or
misfortunes
had
been
base
enough
to
refuse
him
credit
for
a
few
necessaries
until
he
could
have
a
remittance
from
his
steward
in
france
he
therefore
conjured
count
fathom
as
a
stranger
and
nobleman
like
himself
to
be
the
messenger
of
defiance
which
he
resolved
to
send
to
that
brutal
jailor
that
for
the
future
he
might
learn
to
make
proper
distinctions
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
fathom
who
had
no
inclination
to
offend
this
choleric
frenchman
assured
him
that
he
might
depend
upon
his
friendship
and
in
the
meantime
prevailed
upon
him
to
accept
of
a
small
supply
in
consequence
of
which
he
procured
a
pound
of
sausages
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
company
without
delay
making
a
very
suitable
addition
to
such
an
assemblage
of
rarities
though
his
age
did
not
exceed
thirty
years
his
beard
which
was
of
a
brindled
hue
flowed
down
like
aaron
to
his
middle
upon
his
legs
he
wore
red
stockings
rolled
up
over
the
joint
of
the
knee
his
breeches
were
of
blue
drab
with
vellum
and
garters
of
gold
lace
his
waistcoat
of
scarlet
his
coat
of
rusty
black
cloth
his
hair
twisted
into
a
ramilie
hung
down
to
his
rump
of
the
colour
of
jet
and
his
hat
was
adorned
with
a
white
feather
this
original
had
formed
many
ingenious
schemes
to
increase
the
glory
and
grandeur
of
france
but
was
discouraged
by
cardinal
fleury
who
in
all
appearance
jealous
of
his
great
talents
not
only
rejected
his
projects
but
even
sent
him
to
prison
on
pretence
of
being
offended
at
his
impertinence
perceiving
that
like
the
prophet
he
had
no
honour
in
his
own
country
he
no
sooner
obtained
his
release
than
he
retired
to
england
where
he
was
prompted
by
his
philanthropy
to
propose
an
expedient
to
our
ministry
which
would
have
saved
a
vast
effusion
of
blood
and
treasure
this
was
an
agreement
between
the
queen
of
hungary
and
the
late
emperor
to
decide
their
pretensions
by
a
single
combat
in
which
case
he
offered
himself
as
the
bavarian
champion
but
in
this
endeavour
he
also
proved
unsuccessful
then
turning
his
attention
to
the
delights
of
poetry
he
became
so
enamoured
of
the
muse
that
he
neglected
every
other
consideration
and
she
as
usual
gradually
conducted
him
to
the
author
goal
a
place
of
rest
appointed
for
all
those
sinners
whom
the
profane
love
of
poesy
hath
led
astray
chapter
one
quarrel
is
compromised
and
another
decided
by
unusual
arms
among
other
topics
of
conversation
that
were
discussed
at
this
genial
meeting
sir
mungo
scheme
was
brought
upon
the
carpet
by
his
majesty
who
was
graciously
pleased
to
ask
how
his
subscription
filled
to
this
interrogation
the
knight
answered
that
he
met
with
great
opposition
from
a
spirit
of
levity
and
which
seemed
to
prevail
in
this
generation
but
that
no
difficulties
should
discourage
him
from
persevering
in
his
duty
and
he
trusted
in
god
that
in
a
very
little
time
he
should
be
able
to
confute
and
overthrow
the
false
philosophy
of
the
moderns
and
to
restore
the
writings
of
moses
to
that
and
veneration
which
is
due
to
an
inspired
author
he
spoke
of
the
immortal
newton
with
infinite
contempt
and
undertook
to
extract
from
the
pentateuch
a
system
of
chronology
which
would
ascertain
the
progress
of
time
since
the
fourth
day
of
the
creation
to
the
present
hour
with
such
exactness
that
not
one
vibration
of
a
pendulum
should
be
lost
nay
he
affirmed
that
the
perfection
of
all
arts
and
sciences
might
be
attained
by
studying
these
secret
memoirs
and
that
he
himself
did
not
despair
of
learning
from
them
the
art
of
transmuting
baser
metals
into
gold
the
chevalier
though
he
did
not
pretend
to
contradict
these
assertions
was
too
much
attached
to
his
own
religion
to
acquiesce
in
the
project
of
converting
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
to
the
protestant
heresy
which
he
said
god
almighty
would
never
suffer
to
triumph
over
the
interests
of
his
own
holy
catholic
church
this
objection
produced
abundance
of
altercation
between
two
very
unequal
disputants
and
the
frenchman
finding
himself
puzzled
by
the
learning
of
his
antagonist
had
recourse
to
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
by
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
and
declaring
that
he
was
ready
to
lose
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
in
opposition
to
such
a
damnable
scheme
sir
mungo
though
in
all
appearance
reduced
to
the
last
stage
of
animal
existence
no
sooner
heard
this
epithet
applied
to
his
plan
than
his
eyes
gleamed
like
lightning
he
sprung
from
his
seat
with
the
agility
of
a
grasshopper
and
darting
himself
out
at
the
door
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
reappeared
in
a
moment
with
a
long
rusty
weapon
which
might
have
been
shown
among
a
collection
of
rarities
as
the
sword
of
guy
earl
of
warwick
this
implement
he
brandished
over
the
chevalier
head
with
the
dexterity
of
an
old
exclaiming
in
the
french
language
thou
art
a
profane
wretch
marked
out
for
the
vengeance
of
heaven
whose
unworthy
minister
i
am
and
here
thou
shalt
fall
by
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
the
chevalier
unterrified
by
this
dreadful
salutation
desired
he
would
accompany
him
to
a
more
convenient
place
and
the
world
might
have
been
deprived
of
one
or
both
these
had
not
general
macleaver
at
the
desire
of
his
majesty
interposed
and
found
means
to
bring
matters
to
an
accommodation
in
the
afternoon
the
society
was
visited
by
the
major
cousin
and
her
daughters
who
no
sooner
appeared
than
they
were
recognised
by
our
adventurer
and
his
acquaintance
with
them
renewed
in
such
a
manner
as
alarmed
the
delicacy
of
captain
minikin
who
in
the
evening
repaired
to
the
count
apartment
and
with
a
formal
physiognomy
accosted
him
in
these
words
sir
i
beg
pardon
for
this
intrusion
but
i
come
to
consult
you
about
an
affair
in
which
my
honour
is
concerned
and
a
soldier
without
honour
you
know
is
no
better
than
a
body
without
a
soul
i
have
always
admired
that
speech
of
hotspur
in
the
first
part
of
henry
the
fourth
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
there
is
a
boldness
and
ease
in
the
expression
and
the
images
are
very
picturesque
but
without
any
further
preamble
pray
sir
give
me
leave
to
ask
how
long
you
have
been
acquainted
with
those
ladies
who
drank
tea
with
us
this
afternoon
you
forgive
the
question
sir
when
i
tell
you
that
major
macleaver
introduced
minikin
to
them
as
to
ladies
of
character
and
i
do
know
how
sir
i
have
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
my
wife
has
been
imposed
upon
perhaps
i
may
be
mistaken
and
god
grant
i
may
but
there
was
a
je
ne
sais
quoi
in
their
behaviour
which
begins
to
alarm
my
suspicion
sir
i
have
nothing
but
my
reputation
to
depend
upon
and
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
when
i
earnestly
beg
to
know
what
rank
they
maintain
in
fathom
without
minding
the
consequence
told
him
with
a
simper
that
he
knew
them
to
be
very
ladies
who
devoted
themselves
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
this
explanation
had
no
sooner
escaped
from
his
lips
than
the
captain
face
began
to
glow
with
indignation
his
eyes
seemed
bursting
from
their
spheres
he
swelled
to
twice
his
natural
dimensions
and
raising
himself
on
his
tiptoes
pronounced
in
a
strain
that
emulated
thunder
blood
sir
you
seem
to
make
very
light
of
the
matter
but
it
is
no
joke
to
me
i
assure
you
and
macleaver
shall
see
that
i
am
not
to
be
affronted
with
impunity
sir
i
shall
take
it
as
a
singular
favour
if
you
will
be
the
bearer
of
a
billet
to
him
which
i
shall
write
in
three
words
nay
sir
you
must
give
me
leave
to
insist
upon
it
as
you
are
the
only
gentleman
of
our
mess
whom
i
can
intrust
with
an
affair
of
this
fathom
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
disobliging
such
a
punctilious
warrior
after
having
in
vain
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
undertook
to
carry
the
challenge
which
was
immediately
penned
in
these
words
sir
you
have
violated
my
honour
in
imposing
upon
minikin
your
pretended
cousins
as
ladies
of
virtue
and
reputation
i
therefore
demand
such
satisfaction
as
a
soldier
ought
to
receive
and
expect
you
will
adjust
with
my
friend
count
fathom
the
terms
upon
which
you
shall
be
met
by
the
much
injured
goliah
this
morceau
being
sealed
and
directed
was
forthwith
carried
by
our
adventurer
to
the
lodgings
of
the
major
who
had
by
this
time
retired
to
rest
but
hearing
the
count
voice
he
got
up
and
opened
the
door
in
cuerpo
to
the
astonishment
of
ferdinand
who
had
never
before
seen
such
an
herculean
figure
he
made
an
apology
for
receiving
the
count
in
his
birthday
suit
to
which
he
said
he
was
reduced
by
the
heat
of
his
constitution
though
he
might
have
assigned
a
more
adequate
cause
by
owning
that
his
shirt
was
in
the
hands
of
his
washerwoman
then
shrouding
himself
in
a
blanket
desired
to
know
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
such
an
extraordinary
visit
he
read
the
letter
with
great
composure
like
a
man
accustomed
to
such
intercourse
then
addressing
himself
to
the
bearer
i
will
be
after
diverting
the
gentleman
said
he
in
any
manner
he
shall
think
proper
but
by
jesus
this
is
no
place
for
such
amusements
because
as
you
well
know
my
dear
count
if
both
should
be
killed
by
the
chance
of
war
neither
of
us
will
be
able
to
escape
and
after
the
breath
is
out
of
his
body
he
will
make
but
a
sorry
excuse
to
his
family
and
friends
but
that
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
therefore
i
am
ready
to
please
him
in
his
own
fathom
approved
of
his
remarks
which
he
reinforced
with
sundry
considerations
to
the
same
purpose
and
begged
the
assistance
of
the
major
advice
in
finding
some
expedient
to
terminate
the
affair
without
bloodshed
that
no
troublesome
consequences
might
ensue
either
to
him
or
to
his
antagonist
who
in
spite
of
this
overstraining
formality
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
worth
and
with
all
my
heart
said
the
generous
hibernian
i
have
a
great
regard
for
the
little
man
and
my
own
character
is
not
to
seek
at
this
time
of
day
i
have
served
a
long
apprenticeship
to
fighting
as
this
same
carcase
can
testify
and
if
he
compels
me
to
run
him
through
the
body
by
my
shoul
i
shall
do
it
in
a
friendly
so
saying
he
threw
aside
the
blanket
and
displayed
scars
and
seams
innumerable
upon
his
body
which
appeared
like
an
old
patched
leathern
doublet
i
remember
proceeded
this
champion
when
i
was
a
slave
at
algiers
murphy
macmorris
and
i
happened
to
have
some
difference
in
the
bagnio
upon
which
he
bade
me
turn
out
for
what
said
i
are
no
weapons
that
a
gentleman
can
use
and
you
would
not
be
such
a
negro
as
to
box
like
an
english
carman
after
he
had
puzzled
himself
for
some
time
he
proposed
that
we
should
retire
into
a
corner
and
funk
one
another
with
brimstone
till
one
of
us
should
give
out
accordingly
we
crammed
half
a
dozen
tobacco
pipes
with
sulphur
and
setting
foot
to
foot
began
to
smoke
and
kept
a
constant
fire
until
macmorris
dropped
down
then
i
threw
away
my
pipe
and
taking
poor
murphy
in
my
arms
are
you
dead
said
i
you
are
dead
speak
by
jesus
cried
he
a
dead
but
i
speechless
so
he
owned
i
had
obtained
the
victory
and
we
were
as
good
friends
as
ever
now
if
minikin
thinks
proper
to
put
the
affair
upon
the
same
issue
i
will
smoke
a
pipe
of
brimstone
with
him
morning
and
if
i
cry
out
first
i
will
be
after
asking
pardon
for
this
supposed
fathom
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
proposal
to
which
however
he
objected
on
account
of
minikin
delicate
constitution
which
might
suffer
more
detriment
from
breathing
in
an
atmosphere
of
sulphur
than
from
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
or
the
thrust
of
a
small
sword
he
therefore
suggested
another
expedient
in
lieu
of
the
sulphur
namely
the
gum
called
assafatida
which
though
abundantly
nauseous
could
have
no
effect
upon
the
infirm
texture
of
the
lieutenant
lungs
this
hint
being
relished
by
the
major
our
adventurer
returned
to
his
principal
and
having
repeated
the
other
arguments
against
the
use
of
mortal
instruments
described
the
succedaneum
which
he
had
concerted
with
macleaver
the
captain
at
first
believed
the
scheme
was
calculated
for
subjecting
him
to
the
ridicule
of
his
and
began
to
storm
with
great
violence
but
by
the
assurances
and
address
of
fathom
he
was
at
length
reconciled
to
the
plan
and
preparations
were
made
on
each
side
for
this
duel
which
was
actually
smoked
next
day
about
noon
in
a
small
closet
detached
from
the
challenger
apartment
and
within
hearing
of
his
majesty
and
all
his
court
assembled
as
witnesses
and
umpires
of
the
contest
the
combatants
being
locked
up
together
began
to
ply
their
engines
with
great
fury
and
it
was
not
long
before
captain
minikin
perceived
he
had
a
manifest
advantage
over
his
antagonist
for
his
organs
were
familiarised
to
the
effluvia
of
this
drug
which
he
had
frequently
used
in
the
course
of
an
hypochondriac
disorder
whereas
macleaver
who
was
a
stranger
to
all
sorts
of
medicine
by
his
wry
faces
and
attempts
to
puke
expressed
the
utmost
abhorrence
of
the
smell
that
invaded
his
nostrils
nevertheless
resolved
to
hold
out
to
the
last
extremity
he
continued
in
action
until
the
closet
was
filled
with
such
an
intolerable
vapour
as
discomposed
the
whole
economy
of
his
entrails
and
compelled
him
to
disgorge
his
breakfast
in
the
face
of
his
opponent
whose
nerves
were
so
disconcerted
by
this
disagreeable
and
unforeseen
discharge
that
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
in
a
swoon
and
the
major
bellowed
aloud
for
assistance
the
door
being
opened
he
ran
directly
to
the
window
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
while
the
captain
recovering
from
his
fit
complained
of
macleaver
unfair
proceeding
and
demanded
justice
of
the
arbitrators
who
decided
in
his
favour
and
the
major
being
prevailed
upon
to
ask
pardon
for
having
introduced
minikin
to
women
of
rotten
reputation
the
parties
were
reconciled
to
each
other
and
peace
and
concord
in
the
mess
fathom
acquired
universal
applause
for
his
discreet
and
humane
conduct
upon
this
occasion
and
that
same
afternoon
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
lady
in
whose
cause
he
had
exerted
himself
he
was
presented
to
her
as
the
husband
particular
friend
and
when
she
understood
how
much
she
was
indebted
to
his
care
and
concern
for
the
captain
safety
she
treated
him
with
uncommon
marks
of
distinction
and
he
found
her
a
genteel
woman
not
without
a
good
deal
of
personal
charms
and
a
understanding
chapter
an
unexpected
rencontre
and
a
happy
revolution
in
the
affairs
of
our
adventurer
as
she
did
not
lodge
within
the
precincts
of
this
garrison
she
was
one
day
after
tea
conducted
to
the
gate
by
the
captain
and
the
count
and
just
as
they
approached
the
turnkey
lodge
our
hero
eyes
were
struck
with
the
apparition
of
his
old
companion
renaldo
son
of
his
benefactor
and
patron
the
count
de
melvil
what
were
the
emotions
of
his
soul
when
he
saw
that
young
gentleman
enter
the
prison
and
advance
towards
him
after
having
spoke
to
the
jailor
he
never
doubted
that
being
informed
of
his
confinement
he
was
come
to
upbraid
him
with
his
villany
and
ingratitude
and
he
in
vain
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
from
that
terror
and
guilty
confusion
which
his
appearance
had
inspired
when
the
stranger
lifting
up
his
eyes
started
back
with
signs
of
extreme
amazement
and
after
a
considerable
pause
exclaimed
heaven
and
earth
sure
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
is
not
your
name
fathom
it
is
it
must
be
my
old
friend
and
companion
the
loss
of
whom
i
have
so
long
regretted
with
these
words
he
ran
towards
our
adventurer
and
while
he
clasped
him
in
his
arms
with
all
the
eagerness
of
affection
protested
that
this
was
one
of
the
happiest
days
he
had
ever
seen
ferdinand
who
from
this
salutation
concluded
himself
still
in
possession
of
renaldo
good
opinion
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
tenderness
and
joy
he
returned
his
embraces
with
equal
ardour
the
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
and
that
perturbation
which
proceeded
from
conscious
perfidy
and
fear
was
mistaken
by
the
unsuspecting
hungarian
for
the
sheer
effects
of
love
gratitude
and
surprise
these
first
transports
having
subsided
they
adjourned
to
the
lodgings
of
fathom
who
soon
recollected
his
spirits
and
invention
so
well
as
to
amuse
the
other
with
a
feigned
tale
of
his
having
been
taken
by
the
french
sent
prisoner
into
champagne
from
whence
he
had
written
many
letters
to
count
melvil
and
his
son
of
whom
he
could
hear
no
tidings
of
his
having
contracted
an
intimacy
with
a
young
nobleman
of
france
who
died
in
the
flower
of
his
age
after
having
in
token
of
his
friendship
bequeathed
to
him
a
considerable
legacy
by
this
he
had
been
enabled
to
visit
the
land
of
his
forefathers
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
which
he
had
supported
with
some
figure
until
he
was
betrayed
into
a
misfortune
that
exhausted
his
funds
and
drove
him
to
the
spot
where
he
was
now
found
and
he
solemnly
declared
that
far
from
forgetting
the
obligation
he
owed
to
count
melvil
or
renouncing
the
friendship
of
renaldo
he
had
actually
resolved
to
set
out
for
germany
on
his
return
to
the
house
of
his
patron
in
the
beginning
of
the
week
posterior
to
that
in
which
he
had
been
arrested
young
melvil
whose
own
heart
had
never
known
the
instigations
of
fraud
implicitly
believed
the
story
and
protestations
of
fathom
and
though
he
would
not
justify
that
part
of
his
conduct
by
which
the
term
of
his
good
fortune
was
abridged
he
could
not
help
excusing
an
indiscretion
into
which
he
had
been
hurried
by
the
precipitancy
of
youth
and
the
allurements
of
an
artful
woman
nay
with
the
utmost
warmth
of
friendship
he
undertook
to
wait
upon
trapwell
and
endeavour
to
soften
him
into
some
reasonable
terms
of
composition
fathom
seemed
to
be
quite
overwhelmed
with
a
deep
sense
of
all
this
goodness
and
affected
the
most
eager
impatience
to
know
the
particulars
of
renaldo
fate
since
their
unhappy
separation
more
especially
his
errand
to
this
uncomfortable
place
which
he
should
henceforth
revere
as
the
providential
scene
of
their
reunion
nor
did
he
forget
to
inquire
in
the
most
affectionate
and
dutiful
manner
about
the
situation
of
his
noble
parents
and
amiable
sister
at
mention
of
these
names
renaldo
fetching
a
deep
sigh
alas
my
friend
said
he
the
count
is
no
more
and
what
aggravates
my
affliction
for
the
loss
of
such
a
father
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
under
his
displeasure
at
the
time
of
his
death
had
i
been
present
on
that
melancholy
occasion
so
well
i
knew
his
generosity
and
paternal
tenderness
that
sure
i
am
he
would
in
his
last
moments
have
forgiven
an
only
son
whose
life
had
been
a
continual
effort
to
render
himself
worthy
of
such
a
parent
and
whose
crime
was
no
other
than
an
honourable
passion
for
the
most
meritorious
of
her
sex
but
i
was
removed
at
a
fatal
distance
from
him
and
doubtless
my
conduct
must
have
been
invidiously
misrepresented
be
that
as
it
will
my
mother
has
again
given
her
hand
in
wedlock
to
count
trebasi
by
whom
i
have
the
mortification
to
be
informed
that
i
am
totally
excluded
from
my
succession
and
i
learn
from
other
quarters
that
my
sister
is
barbarously
treated
by
this
inhuman
grant
heaven
i
may
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
expostulating
with
the
tyrant
upon
that
so
saying
his
cheeks
glowed
and
his
eyes
lightened
with
resentment
then
he
thus
proceeded
my
coming
hither
was
with
a
view
to
visit
a
poor
female
relation
from
whom
i
yesterday
received
a
letter
describing
her
most
deplorable
situation
and
soliciting
my
assistance
but
the
turnkey
affirms
that
there
is
no
such
person
in
the
jail
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
consult
the
keeper
when
i
was
agreeably
surprised
with
the
sight
of
my
dear
our
adventurer
having
wiped
from
his
eyes
the
tears
which
were
produced
by
the
news
of
his
worthy
patron
death
desired
to
know
the
name
of
that
afflicted
prisoner
in
whose
behalf
he
interested
himself
so
much
and
renaldo
produced
the
letter
subscribed
your
unfortunate
cousin
helen
this
pretended
relation
after
having
explained
the
degree
of
consanguinity
which
she
and
the
count
stood
in
to
each
other
and
occasionally
mentioned
some
anecdotes
of
the
family
in
scotland
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
had
married
a
merchant
of
london
who
by
repeated
losses
in
trade
had
been
reduced
to
indigence
and
afterwards
confined
to
prison
where
he
then
lay
a
breathless
corpse
having
left
her
in
the
utmost
extremity
of
wretchedness
and
want
with
two
young
children
in
the
smallpox
and
an
incurable
cancer
in
one
of
her
own
breasts
indeed
the
picture
she
drew
was
so
moving
and
her
expressions
so
sensibly
pathetic
that
no
person
whose
heart
was
not
altogether
callous
could
peruse
it
without
emotion
renaldo
had
sent
two
guineas
by
the
messenger
whom
she
had
represented
as
a
trusty
servant
whose
fidelity
had
been
proof
against
all
the
distress
of
her
mistress
and
he
was
now
arrived
in
order
to
reinforce
his
bounty
fathom
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
practices
immediately
comprehended
the
scheme
of
this
letter
and
confidently
assured
him
that
no
such
person
resided
in
the
prison
or
in
any
other
place
and
when
his
friend
applied
for
information
to
the
keeper
these
assurances
were
confirmed
and
that
stern
janitor
told
him
he
had
been
imposed
upon
by
a
stale
trick
which
was
often
practised
upon
strangers
by
a
set
of
sharpers
who
make
it
their
business
to
pick
up
hints
of
intelligence
relating
to
private
families
upon
which
they
build
such
superstructures
of
fraud
and
imposition
however
piqued
the
young
hungarian
might
be
to
find
himself
duped
in
this
manner
he
rejoiced
at
the
occasion
which
had
thrown
fathom
in
his
way
and
after
having
made
him
a
tender
of
his
purse
took
his
leave
on
purpose
to
wait
upon
trapwell
who
was
not
quite
so
untractable
as
an
enraged
cuckold
commonly
is
for
by
this
time
he
had
accomplished
the
best
part
of
his
aim
which
was
to
be
divorced
from
his
wife
and
was
fully
convinced
that
the
defendant
was
no
more
than
a
needy
adventurer
who
in
all
probability
would
be
released
by
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
benefit
of
insolvent
debtors
in
which
case
he
the
plaintiff
would
reap
no
solid
advantage
from
his
imprisonment
he
therefore
listened
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
mediator
and
after
much
canvassing
agreed
to
discharge
the
defendant
in
consideration
of
two
hundred
pounds
which
were
immediately
paid
by
count
melvil
who
by
this
deduction
was
reduced
to
somewhat
less
than
thirty
nevertheless
he
cheerfully
beggared
himself
in
behalf
of
his
friend
for
whose
release
he
forthwith
obtained
an
order
and
next
day
our
adventurer
having
bid
a
formal
adieu
to
his
fellows
in
distress
and
in
particular
to
his
majesty
for
whose
restoration
his
prayers
were
preferred
he
quitted
the
jail
and
accompanied
his
deliverer
with
all
the
outward
marks
of
unutterable
gratitude
and
esteem
surely
if
his
heart
had
been
made
of
penetrable
stuff
it
would
have
been
touched
by
the
circumstances
of
this
redemption
but
had
not
his
soul
been
invincible
to
all
such
attacks
these
memoirs
would
possibly
never
have
seen
the
light
when
they
arrived
at
renaldo
lodgings
that
young
gentleman
honoured
him
with
other
proofs
of
confidence
and
friendship
by
giving
him
a
circumstantial
detail
of
all
the
adventures
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
after
fathom
desertion
from
the
imperial
camp
he
told
him
that
immediately
after
the
war
was
finished
his
father
had
pressed
him
to
a
very
advantageous
match
with
which
he
would
have
complied
though
his
heart
was
not
at
all
concerned
had
not
he
been
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
the
world
before
he
could
take
any
step
towards
a
settlement
for
life
that
he
had
signified
his
sentiments
on
this
head
to
the
count
who
opposed
them
with
unusual
obstinacy
as
productive
of
a
delay
which
might
be
fatal
to
his
proposal
for
which
reason
he
had
retired
incognito
from
his
family
and
travelled
through
sundry
states
and
countries
in
a
disguise
by
which
he
eluded
the
inquiries
of
his
parents
that
in
the
course
of
these
peregrinations
he
was
captivated
by
the
irresistible
charms
of
a
young
lady
on
whose
heart
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
a
tender
impression
that
their
mutual
love
had
subjected
both
to
many
dangers
and
difficulties
during
which
they
suffered
a
cruel
separation
after
the
torments
of
which
he
had
happily
found
her
in
england
where
she
now
lived
entirely
cut
off
from
her
native
country
and
connexions
and
destitute
of
every
other
resource
but
his
honour
love
and
protection
and
finally
that
he
was
determined
to
combat
his
own
desires
how
violent
soever
they
might
be
until
he
should
have
made
some
suitable
provision
for
the
consequences
of
a
stricter
union
with
the
mistress
of
his
soul
that
he
might
not
by
a
precipitate
marriage
ruin
the
person
whom
he
adored
this
end
he
proposed
to
attain
by
an
application
to
the
court
of
vienna
which
he
did
not
doubt
would
have
some
regard
to
his
own
service
and
that
of
his
father
and
thither
he
resolved
to
repair
with
the
first
opportunity
now
that
he
had
found
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
intrust
the
inestimable
jewel
of
his
heart
he
likewise
gave
our
hero
to
understand
that
he
had
been
eight
months
in
england
during
which
he
had
lived
in
a
frugal
manner
that
he
might
not
unnecessarily
exhaust
the
money
he
had
been
able
to
raise
upon
his
own
credit
that
hitherto
he
had
been
obliged
to
defer
his
departure
for
germany
on
account
of
his
attendance
upon
the
mother
of
his
mistress
who
was
lately
dead
of
sorrow
and
chagrin
and
that
since
he
resided
in
london
he
had
often
heard
of
the
celebrated
count
fathom
though
he
never
imagined
that
his
friend
ferdinand
could
be
distinguished
by
that
appellation
chapter
fathom
justifies
the
proverb
what
bred
in
the
bone
will
never
come
out
of
the
some
circumstances
of
this
conversation
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
who
nevertheless
concealed
his
emotions
from
the
knowledge
of
his
friend
and
was
next
day
introduced
to
that
hidden
treasure
of
which
renaldo
had
spoken
with
such
rapture
and
adoration
it
was
not
without
reason
he
had
expatiated
upon
the
personal
attractions
of
this
young
lady
whom
for
the
present
we
shall
call
monimia
a
name
that
implies
her
orphan
situation
when
she
entered
the
room
even
fathom
whose
eyes
had
been
sated
with
beauty
was
struck
dumb
with
admiration
and
could
scarce
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
his
introduction
she
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
eighteen
her
stature
was
tall
her
motion
graceful
a
knot
of
artificial
flowers
restrained
the
luxuriancy
of
her
fine
black
hair
that
flowed
in
shining
ringlets
adown
her
snowy
neck
the
contour
of
her
face
was
oval
her
forehead
remarkably
high
her
complexion
clean
and
delicate
though
not
florid
and
her
eyes
were
so
piercing
as
to
strike
the
soul
of
every
beholder
yet
upon
this
occasion
one
half
of
their
vivacity
was
eclipsed
by
a
languishing
air
of
melancholy
concern
which
while
it
in
a
manner
sheathed
the
edge
of
her
beauty
added
a
most
engaging
sweetness
to
her
looks
in
short
every
feature
was
elegantly
perfect
and
the
harmony
of
the
whole
ravishing
and
delightful
it
was
easy
to
perceive
the
mutual
sentiments
of
the
two
lovers
at
meeting
by
the
pleasure
that
sensibly
diffused
itself
in
the
countenances
of
both
fathom
was
received
by
her
as
the
intimate
friend
of
her
admirer
whom
she
had
often
heard
of
in
terms
of
the
most
sincere
affection
and
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
the
italian
language
because
she
was
a
foreigner
who
had
not
as
yet
made
great
proficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
her
understanding
was
such
as
instead
of
diminishing
reinforced
the
prepossession
which
was
inspired
by
her
appearance
and
if
the
of
her
charms
could
not
melt
the
heart
it
at
least
excited
the
appetite
of
fathom
to
such
a
degree
that
he
gazed
upon
her
with
such
violence
of
desire
as
had
never
transported
him
before
and
he
instantly
began
to
harbour
thoughts
not
only
destructive
to
the
peace
of
his
generous
patron
but
also
to
the
prudential
maxims
he
had
adopted
on
his
first
entrance
into
life
we
have
already
recorded
divers
instances
of
his
conduct
to
prove
that
there
was
an
intemperance
in
his
blood
which
often
interfered
with
his
caution
and
although
he
had
found
means
to
render
this
heat
sometimes
subservient
to
his
interest
yet
in
all
probability
heaven
mingled
the
ingredient
in
his
constitution
on
purpose
to
counteract
his
consummate
craft
defeat
the
villany
of
his
intention
and
at
least
expose
him
to
the
justice
of
the
law
and
the
contempt
of
his
stimulated
as
he
was
by
the
beauty
of
the
incomparable
monimia
he
foresaw
that
the
conquest
of
her
heart
would
cost
him
a
thousand
times
more
labour
and
address
than
all
the
victories
he
had
ever
achieved
for
besides
her
superior
understanding
her
sentiments
of
honour
virtue
gratitude
religion
and
pride
of
birth
her
heart
was
already
engaged
by
the
tenderest
ties
of
love
and
obligation
to
a
man
whose
person
and
acquired
accomplishments
at
least
equalled
his
own
and
whose
connexion
with
him
was
of
such
a
nature
as
raised
an
almost
insurmountable
bar
to
his
design
because
with
what
face
could
he
commence
rival
to
the
person
whose
family
had
raised
him
from
want
and
servility
and
whose
own
generosity
had
rescued
him
from
the
miseries
of
a
dreary
gaol
notwithstanding
these
reflections
he
would
not
lay
aside
an
idea
which
so
agreeably
flattered
his
imagination
he
like
every
other
projector
in
the
same
circumstances
was
so
partial
to
his
own
qualifications
as
to
think
the
lady
would
soon
perceive
a
difference
between
him
and
renaldo
that
could
not
fail
to
turn
to
his
advantage
in
her
opinion
he
depended
a
good
deal
on
the
levity
and
inconstancy
of
the
sex
and
did
not
doubt
that
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
he
should
profit
by
that
languor
which
often
creeps
upon
and
flattens
the
intercourse
of
lovers
cloyed
with
the
sight
and
conversation
of
each
other
this
way
of
arguing
was
very
natural
to
a
man
who
had
never
known
other
motives
than
those
of
sensuality
and
convenience
and
perhaps
upon
these
maxims
he
might
have
succeeded
with
of
the
fair
sex
but
for
once
he
erred
in
his
calculation
monimia
soul
was
perfect
her
virtue
impregnable
his
first
approaches
were
as
usual
performed
by
the
method
of
insinuation
which
succeeded
so
well
that
in
a
few
days
he
actually
acquired
a
very
distinguished
share
of
her
favour
and
esteem
to
this
he
had
been
recommended
in
the
warmest
strain
of
exaggerating
friendship
by
her
dear
renaldo
so
that
placing
the
most
unreserved
confidence
in
his
honour
and
integrity
and
being
almost
quite
destitute
of
acquaintance
she
made
no
scruple
of
owning
herself
pleased
with
his
company
and
conversation
and
therefore
he
was
never
abridged
in
point
of
opportunity
she
had
too
much
discernment
to
overlook
his
uncommon
talents
and
agreeable
address
and
too
much
susceptibility
to
observe
them
with
indifference
she
not
only
regarded
him
as
the
confidant
of
her
lover
but
admired
him
as
a
person
whose
attachment
did
honour
to
count
melvil
choice
she
found
his
discourse
remarkably
entertaining
his
politeness
dignified
with
an
air
of
uncommon
sincerity
and
she
was
ravished
with
his
skill
in
music
an
art
of
which
she
was
deeply
enamoured
while
he
thus
ingratiated
himself
with
the
fair
monimia
renaldo
rejoiced
at
their
intimacy
being
extremely
happy
in
the
thought
of
having
found
a
friend
who
could
amuse
and
protect
the
dear
creature
in
his
absence
that
she
might
be
the
better
prepared
for
the
temporary
separation
which
he
meditated
he
began
to
be
less
frequent
in
his
visits
or
rather
to
interrupt
by
gradual
intermissions
the
constant
attendance
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
since
her
mother
death
this
alteration
she
was
enabled
to
bear
by
the
assiduities
of
fathom
when
she
understood
that
her
lover
was
indispensably
employed
in
negotiating
a
sum
of
money
for
the
purposes
of
his
intended
voyage
this
was
really
the
case
for
as
the
reader
hath
been
already
informed
the
provision
he
had
made
for
that
emergency
was
expended
in
behalf
of
our
adventurer
and
the
persons
of
whom
he
had
borrowed
it
far
from
approving
of
the
use
to
which
it
was
put
and
accommodating
him
with
a
fresh
supply
reproached
him
with
his
benevolence
as
an
act
of
dishonesty
to
them
and
instead
of
favouring
this
second
application
threatened
to
distress
him
for
what
he
had
already
received
while
he
endeavoured
to
surmount
these
difficulties
his
small
reversion
was
quite
exhausted
and
he
saw
himself
on
the
brink
of
wanting
the
common
necessaries
of
life
there
was
no
difficulty
which
he
could
not
have
encountered
with
fortitude
had
he
alone
been
concerned
but
his
affection
and
regard
for
monimia
were
of
such
a
delicate
nature
that
far
from
being
able
to
bear
the
prospect
of
her
wanting
the
least
convenience
he
could
not
endure
that
she
should
suspect
her
situation
cost
him
a
moment
perplexity
because
he
foresaw
it
would
wring
her
gentle
heart
with
unspeakable
anguish
and
vexation
this
therefore
he
endeavoured
to
anticipate
by
expressions
of
confidence
in
the
emperor
equity
and
frequent
declarations
touching
the
goodness
and
security
of
that
credit
from
which
he
derived
his
present
subsistence
chapter
anecdotes
of
poverty
and
experiments
for
the
benefit
of
those
whom
it
may
concern
his
affairs
being
thus
circumstanced
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
passed
his
time
in
tranquillity
every
day
ushered
in
new
demands
and
fresh
anxiety
for
though
his
economy
was
frugal
it
could
not
be
supported
without
money
and
now
not
only
his
funds
were
drained
but
also
his
private
friends
tired
of
relieving
his
domestic
necessities
nay
they
began
to
relinquish
his
company
which
formerly
they
had
coveted
and
those
who
still
favoured
him
with
their
company
embittered
that
favour
with
disagreeable
advice
mingled
with
impertinent
reproof
they
loudly
exclaimed
against
the
last
instance
of
his
friendship
for
fathom
as
a
piece
of
extravagance
which
neither
his
fortune
could
afford
nor
his
conscience
excuse
and
alleged
that
such
specimens
of
generosity
are
vicious
in
any
man
let
his
finances
be
never
so
opulent
if
he
has
any
relations
of
his
own
who
need
his
assistance
but
altogether
scandalous
not
to
say
unjust
in
a
person
who
depends
for
his
own
support
on
the
favour
of
his
friends
these
expostulations
did
not
even
respect
the
beauteous
the
accomplished
the
the
orphan
monimia
although
they
owned
her
perfections
and
did
not
deny
that
it
would
be
highly
meritorious
in
any
man
of
fortune
to
make
her
happy
they
disapproved
of
renaldo
attachment
to
the
fair
beggar
made
light
of
that
intimate
union
of
hearts
which
subsisted
between
the
two
lovers
and
which
no
human
consideration
could
dissolve
and
some
among
them
in
the
consummation
of
their
prudence
ventured
to
hint
a
proposal
of
providing
for
her
in
the
service
of
some
lady
of
fashion
any
reader
of
sensibility
will
easily
conceive
how
these
admonitions
were
relished
by
a
young
gentleman
whose
pride
was
indomitable
whose
notions
of
honour
were
scrupulously
rigid
and
romantic
whose
temper
was
warm
and
whose
love
was
intense
every
such
suggestion
was
as
a
dagger
to
his
soul
and
what
rendered
the
torture
more
exquisite
he
lay
under
obligations
to
those
very
persons
whose
selfish
and
sordid
sentiments
he
disdained
so
that
he
was
restricted
by
gratitude
from
giving
vent
to
his
indignation
and
his
forlorn
circumstances
would
not
permit
him
to
renounce
their
acquaintance
while
he
struggled
with
these
mortifications
his
wants
grew
more
and
more
importunate
and
his
creditors
became
clamorous
fathom
to
whom
all
his
grievances
were
disclosed
lamented
his
hard
hap
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
sympathy
which
he
could
expect
to
find
in
such
a
zealous
adherent
he
upbraided
himself
incessantly
as
the
cause
of
his
patron
distress
took
god
to
witness
that
he
would
rather
have
perished
in
gaol
than
have
enjoyed
his
liberty
had
he
known
it
would
have
cost
his
dearest
friend
and
benefactor
part
of
the
anguish
he
now
saw
him
suffer
and
in
conclusion
the
fervency
of
his
affection
glowed
to
such
a
degree
that
he
offered
to
beg
steal
or
plunder
on
the
highway
for
renaldo
assistance
certain
it
is
he
might
have
recollected
a
less
disagreeable
expedient
than
any
of
these
to
alleviate
the
pangs
of
this
unhappy
lover
for
at
that
very
period
he
was
possessed
of
money
and
moveables
to
the
amount
of
a
much
greater
sum
than
that
which
was
necessary
to
remove
the
severest
pangs
of
the
count
misfortune
but
whether
he
did
not
reflect
upon
this
resource
or
was
willing
to
let
melvil
be
better
acquainted
with
adversity
which
is
the
great
school
of
life
i
shall
leave
the
reader
to
determine
yet
so
far
was
he
from
supplying
the
wants
of
the
young
hungarian
that
he
did
not
scruple
to
receive
a
share
of
the
miserable
pittance
which
that
gentleman
made
shift
to
extort
from
the
complaisance
of
a
few
companions
whose
countenance
he
still
enjoyed
renaldo
life
was
now
become
a
sacrifice
to
the
most
poignant
distress
almost
his
whole
time
was
engrossed
by
a
double
scheme
comprehending
his
efforts
to
render
his
departure
practicable
and
his
expedients
for
raising
the
means
of
daily
bread
with
regard
to
the
first
he
exerted
himself
among
a
set
of
merchants
some
of
whom
knew
his
family
and
expectations
and
for
the
last
he
was
fain
to
depend
upon
the
assistance
of
a
few
intimates
who
were
not
in
a
condition
to
furnish
him
with
sums
of
consequence
these
however
gradually
dropped
off
on
pretence
of
friendly
resentment
for
his
indiscreet
conduct
so
that
he
found
himself
naked
and
deserted
by
all
his
former
companions
except
one
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
lived
in
the
most
unreserved
correspondence
as
with
a
person
of
the
warmest
friendship
and
the
most
unbounded
benevolence
nay
he
had
actually
experienced
repeated
proofs
of
his
generosity
and
such
were
the
count
sentiments
of
the
gratitude
love
and
esteem
which
were
due
to
the
author
of
these
obligations
that
he
would
have
willingly
laid
down
his
own
life
for
his
interest
or
advantage
he
had
already
been
at
different
times
accommodated
by
this
benefactor
with
occasional
supplies
amounting
in
the
whole
to
about
forty
or
fifty
pounds
and
so
fearful
was
he
of
taking
any
step
by
which
he
might
forfeit
the
goodwill
of
this
gentleman
that
he
struggled
with
unparelleled
difficulty
and
vexation
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
put
his
liberality
to
another
proof
what
maxims
of
delicacy
will
not
the
dire
calls
of
necessity
infringe
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
applying
once
more
to
that
beneficence
which
had
never
failed
him
or
of
seeing
monimia
starve
he
chose
the
first
as
of
two
evils
the
least
and
intrusted
fathom
with
a
letter
explaining
the
bitterness
of
his
case
it
was
not
without
trepidation
that
he
received
in
the
evening
from
his
messenger
an
answer
to
this
billet
but
what
were
his
pangs
when
he
learned
the
contents
the
gentleman
after
having
professed
himself
melvil
sincere
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
resolved
for
the
future
to
detach
himself
from
every
correspondence
which
would
be
inconvenient
for
him
to
maintain
that
he
considered
his
intimacy
with
the
count
in
that
light
yet
nevertheless
if
his
distress
was
really
as
great
as
he
had
described
it
he
would
still
contribute
something
towards
his
relief
and
accordingly
had
sent
by
the
bearer
five
guineas
for
that
purpose
but
desired
him
to
take
notice
that
in
so
doing
he
laid
himself
under
some
difficulty
renaldo
grief
and
mortification
at
this
disappointment
were
unspeakable
he
now
saw
demolished
the
last
screen
betwixt
him
and
the
extremity
of
indigence
and
woe
he
beheld
the
mistress
of
his
soul
abandoned
to
the
bleakest
scenes
of
poverty
and
want
and
he
deeply
resented
the
lofty
strain
of
the
letter
by
which
he
conceived
himself
treated
as
a
worthless
spendthrift
and
importunate
beggar
though
his
purse
was
exhausted
to
the
last
shilling
though
he
was
surrounded
with
necessities
and
demands
and
knew
not
how
to
provide
another
meal
for
his
fair
dependent
he
in
opposition
to
all
the
suggestions
and
eloquence
of
fathom
despatched
him
with
the
money
and
another
billet
intimating
in
the
most
respectful
terms
that
he
approved
of
his
friend
maxim
which
for
the
future
he
should
always
take
care
to
remember
and
that
he
had
sent
back
the
last
instance
of
his
bounty
as
a
proof
how
little
he
was
disposed
to
incommode
his
benefactor
this
letter
though
sincerely
meant
and
written
in
a
very
serious
mood
the
gentleman
considered
as
an
ungrateful
piece
of
irony
and
in
that
opinion
complained
to
several
persons
of
the
count
acquaintance
who
unanimously
exclaimed
against
him
as
a
sordid
unthankful
and
profligate
knave
that
abused
and
reviled
those
very
people
who
had
generously
befriended
him
whenever
they
found
it
inconvenient
to
nourish
his
extravagance
with
further
supplies
notwithstanding
these
accumulated
oppressions
he
still
persevered
with
fortitude
in
his
endeavours
to
disentangle
himself
from
this
maze
of
misery
to
these
he
was
encouraged
by
a
letter
which
about
this
time
he
received
from
his
sister
importing
that
she
had
good
reason
to
believe
the
real
will
of
her
father
had
been
suppressed
for
certain
sinister
views
and
desiring
him
to
hasten
his
departure
for
hungary
where
he
would
still
find
some
friends
who
were
both
able
and
willing
to
support
his
cause
he
had
some
trinkets
left
the
pawnbroker
shop
was
still
open
and
hitherto
he
made
shift
to
conceal
from
monimia
the
extent
of
his
affliction
the
whom
he
employed
after
having
amused
him
with
a
variety
of
schemes
which
served
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
protracting
his
own
job
at
length
undertook
to
make
him
acquainted
with
a
set
of
monied
men
who
had
been
very
venturous
in
lending
sums
upon
personal
security
he
was
therefore
introduced
to
their
club
in
the
most
favourable
manner
after
the
broker
had
endeavoured
to
prepossess
them
separately
with
magnificent
ideas
of
his
family
and
by
means
of
this
anticipation
he
was
received
with
a
manifest
relaxation
of
that
severity
which
people
of
this
class
mingle
in
their
aspects
to
the
world
in
general
and
they
even
vied
with
each
other
in
their
demonstrations
of
hospitality
and
respect
for
every
one
in
particular
looked
upon
him
as
a
young
heir
who
would
bleed
freely
and
mortgage
at
cent
per
cent
renaldo
buoyed
up
with
these
exterior
civilities
began
to
flatter
himself
with
hopes
of
success
which
however
were
soon
checked
by
the
nature
of
the
conversation
during
which
the
chairman
upbraided
one
of
the
members
in
open
club
for
having
once
lent
forty
pounds
upon
slight
security
the
person
accused
alleged
in
his
own
defence
that
the
borrower
was
his
own
kinsman
whose
funds
he
knew
to
be
sufficient
that
he
had
granted
his
bond
and
been
at
the
expense
of
insuring
his
life
for
the
money
and
in
conclusion
had
discharged
it
to
the
day
with
great
punctuality
these
allegations
were
not
deemed
exculpatory
by
the
rest
of
the
assembly
who
with
one
voice
pronounced
him
guilty
of
unwarrantable
rashness
and
indiscretion
which
in
time
coming
must
undoubtedly
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
his
character
and
credit
this
was
a
bitter
declaration
to
the
young
count
who
nevertheless
endeavoured
to
improve
the
footing
he
had
gained
among
them
by
courting
their
company
conforming
to
their
manners
and
attentively
listening
to
their
discourse
when
he
had
cultivated
them
with
great
assiduity
for
the
space
of
some
weeks
dined
at
their
houses
upon
pressing
invitations
and
received
repeated
offers
of
service
and
friendship
believing
that
things
were
now
ripe
for
the
purpose
he
one
day
at
a
tavern
to
which
he
had
invited
him
to
dinner
ventured
to
disclose
his
situation
to
him
whose
countenance
was
the
least
unpromising
and
as
he
introduced
the
business
with
a
proposal
of
borrowing
money
he
perceived
his
eyes
sparkle
with
a
visible
alacrity
from
which
he
drew
a
happy
presage
but
alas
this
was
no
more
than
a
transient
gleam
of
sunshine
which
was
suddenly
obumbrated
by
the
sequel
of
his
explanation
insomuch
that
when
the
merchant
understood
the
nature
of
the
security
his
visage
was
involved
in
a
most
disagreeable
gloom
and
his
eyes
distorted
into
a
most
hideous
obliquity
of
vision
indeed
he
squinted
so
horribly
that
renaldo
was
amazed
and
almost
affrighted
at
his
looks
until
he
perceived
that
this
distortion
proceeded
from
concern
for
a
silver
tobacco
box
which
he
had
laid
down
by
him
on
the
table
after
having
filled
his
pipe
as
the
youth
proceeded
to
unfold
his
necessities
the
other
became
gradually
alarmed
for
this
utensil
to
which
he
darted
his
eyes
askance
in
this
preternatural
direction
until
he
had
slyly
secured
it
in
his
pocket
having
made
this
successful
conveyance
he
shifted
his
eyes
alternately
from
the
young
gentleman
to
the
broker
for
a
considerable
pause
during
which
he
in
silence
reproached
the
last
for
introducing
such
a
beggarly
varlet
to
his
acquaintance
then
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
sir
said
he
addressing
himself
to
the
count
if
i
had
all
the
inclination
in
the
world
to
comply
with
your
proposal
it
is
really
not
in
my
power
my
correspondents
abroad
have
remitted
such
a
number
of
bad
bills
of
late
that
all
my
running
cash
hath
been
exhausted
in
supporting
their
credit
ferret
sure
i
am
you
was
not
ignorant
of
my
situation
and
i
not
a
little
surprised
that
you
should
bring
the
gentleman
to
me
on
business
of
this
kind
but
as
the
wise
man
observes
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
and
he
never
be
so
saying
with
a
most
emphatic
glance
directed
to
the
broker
he
rung
the
bell
and
called
for
the
reckoning
when
finding
that
he
was
to
be
the
guest
of
renaldo
he
thanked
him
drily
for
his
good
cheer
and
in
an
abrupt
manner
took
himself
away
though
baffled
in
this
quarter
the
young
gentleman
would
not
despair
but
forthwith
employed
ferret
in
an
application
to
another
of
the
society
who
after
having
heard
the
terms
of
his
commission
desired
him
to
tell
his
principal
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
the
concurrence
of
his
partner
who
happened
to
be
at
that
time
in
one
of
our
american
plantations
a
third
being
solicited
excused
himself
on
account
of
an
oath
which
he
had
lately
taken
on
the
back
of
a
considerable
loss
a
fourth
being
tried
made
answer
that
it
was
not
in
his
way
and
a
fifth
candidly
owned
that
he
never
lent
money
without
proper
security
thus
the
forlorn
renaldo
tried
every
experiment
without
success
and
now
saw
the
last
ray
of
hope
extinguished
destitute
of
present
support
and
encompassed
with
unrelenting
duns
he
was
obliged
to
keep
within
doors
and
seek
some
comfort
in
the
conversation
of
his
charming
mistress
and
his
faithful
friend
yet
even
there
he
experienced
the
extremest
rigour
of
adverse
fate
every
rap
at
the
door
alarmed
him
with
the
expectation
of
some
noisy
tradesman
demanding
payment
when
he
endeavoured
to
amuse
himself
with
drawing
some
unlucky
feature
of
the
occasional
portrait
recalled
the
image
of
an
obdurate
creditor
and
made
him
tremble
at
the
work
of
his
own
hands
when
he
fled
for
shelter
to
the
flattering
creation
of
fancy
some
abhorred
idea
always
started
up
amidst
the
gay
vision
and
dissolved
the
pleasing
even
the
seraphic
voice
of
monimia
had
no
longer
power
to
compose
the
anxious
tumults
of
his
mind
every
song
she
warbled
every
tune
she
played
recalled
to
his
remembrance
some
scene
of
love
and
happiness
elapsed
and
overwhelmed
his
soul
with
the
woful
comparison
of
past
and
present
fate
he
saw
all
that
was
amiable
and
perfect
in
woman
all
that
he
held
most
dear
and
sacred
upon
earth
tottering
on
the
brink
of
misery
without
knowing
the
danger
of
her
situation
and
found
himself
unable
to
prevent
her
fall
or
even
to
forewarn
her
of
the
peril
for
as
we
have
already
observed
his
soul
could
not
brook
the
thought
of
communicating
the
tidings
of
distress
to
the
monimia
chapter
renaldo
distress
deepens
and
fathom
plot
thickens
such
aggravated
misfortune
could
not
fail
to
affect
his
temper
and
deportment
the
continual
efforts
he
made
to
conceal
his
vexation
produced
a
manifest
distraction
in
his
behaviour
and
discourse
he
began
to
be
seized
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
poor
monimia
whom
he
therefore
shunned
as
much
as
the
circumstances
of
their
correspondence
would
allow
and
every
evening
he
went
forth
alone
to
some
solitary
place
where
he
could
unperceived
give
a
loose
to
the
transports
of
his
sorrow
and
in
silence
meditate
some
means
to
lighten
the
burden
of
his
woe
his
heart
was
sometimes
so
savaged
with
despair
which
represented
mankind
as
his
inveterate
enemies
that
he
entertained
thoughts
of
denouncing
war
against
the
whole
community
and
supplying
his
own
wants
with
the
spoils
he
should
win
at
other
times
he
was
tempted
with
the
desire
of
putting
an
end
to
his
miseries
and
life
together
yet
these
were
but
the
transitory
suggestions
of
temporary
madness
that
soon
yielded
to
the
dictates
of
reason
from
the
execution
of
the
first
he
was
restrained
by
his
own
notions
of
honour
and
morality
and
from
using
the
other
expedient
he
was
deterred
by
his
love
for
monimia
together
with
the
motives
of
philosophy
and
religion
while
in
this
manner
he
secretly
nursed
the
worm
of
grief
that
preyed
upon
his
vitals
the
alteration
in
his
countenance
and
conduct
did
not
escape
the
eyes
of
that
discerning
young
lady
she
was
alarmed
at
the
change
yet
afraid
to
inquire
into
the
source
of
it
for
being
ignorant
of
his
distress
she
could
impute
it
to
no
cause
in
which
her
happiness
was
not
deeply
interested
she
had
observed
his
strained
complaisance
and
extraordinary
emotion
she
had
detected
him
in
repeated
attempts
to
avoid
her
company
and
taken
notice
of
his
regular
excursions
in
the
dark
these
were
alarming
symptoms
to
a
lover
of
her
delicacy
and
pride
she
strove
in
vain
to
put
the
most
favourable
construction
on
what
she
saw
and
finally
imputed
the
effects
of
his
despondence
to
the
alienation
of
his
heart
made
miserable
beyond
expression
by
these
suspicions
she
imparted
them
to
fathom
who
by
this
time
was
in
full
possession
of
her
confidence
and
esteem
and
implored
his
advice
touching
her
conduct
in
such
a
nice
conjuncture
this
artful
politician
who
rejoiced
at
the
effect
of
her
penetration
no
sooner
heard
himself
questioned
on
the
subject
than
he
gave
tokens
of
surprise
and
confusion
signifying
his
concern
to
find
she
had
discovered
what
for
the
honour
of
his
friend
he
wished
had
never
come
to
light
his
behaviour
on
this
occasion
confirmed
her
fatal
conjecture
and
she
conjured
him
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
to
tell
her
if
he
thought
renaldo
heart
had
contracted
any
new
engagement
at
this
question
he
started
with
signs
of
extreme
agitation
and
stifling
an
artificial
sigh
sure
madam
said
he
you
can
not
doubt
the
count
constancy
i
am
confident
he
is
certainly
i
protest
madam
i
am
so
here
he
made
a
full
pause
as
if
the
conflict
between
his
integrity
and
his
friendship
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
and
summoned
the
moisture
into
either
eye
then
are
my
doubts
removed
cried
the
afflicted
monimia
i
see
your
candour
in
the
midst
of
your
attachment
to
renaldo
and
will
no
longer
torment
you
with
impertinent
interrogations
and
vain
with
these
words
a
flood
of
tears
gushed
from
her
enchanting
eyes
and
she
instantly
withdrew
into
her
own
apartment
where
she
indulged
her
sorrow
to
excess
nor
was
her
grief
unanimated
with
resentment
she
was
by
birth
nature
and
education
inspired
with
that
dignity
of
pride
which
ennobles
the
human
heart
and
this
by
the
circumstance
of
her
present
dependence
was
rendered
extremely
jealous
and
susceptible
insomuch
that
she
could
not
brook
the
least
shadow
of
indifference
much
less
an
injury
of
such
a
nature
from
the
man
whom
she
had
honoured
with
her
affections
and
for
whom
she
had
disobliged
and
deserted
her
family
and
friends
though
her
love
was
so
unalterably
fixed
on
this
unhappy
youth
that
without
the
continuation
of
reciprocal
regard
her
life
would
have
become
an
unsupportable
burden
even
amidst
all
the
splendour
of
affluence
and
pomp
and
although
she
foresaw
that
when
his
protection
should
cease
she
must
be
left
a
wretched
orphan
in
a
foreign
land
exposed
to
all
the
miseries
of
want
yet
such
was
the
loftiness
of
her
displeasure
that
she
disdained
to
complain
or
even
demand
an
explanation
from
the
supposed
author
of
her
wrongs
while
she
continued
undetermined
in
her
purpose
and
fluctuating
on
this
sea
of
torture
fathom
believing
that
now
was
the
season
for
working
upon
her
passions
while
they
were
all
in
commotion
became
if
possible
more
assiduous
than
ever
about
the
fair
mourner
modelled
his
features
into
a
melancholy
cast
pretended
to
share
her
distress
with
the
most
emphatic
sympathy
and
endeavoured
to
keep
her
resentment
glowing
by
cunning
insinuations
which
though
apparently
designed
to
apologise
for
his
friend
served
only
to
aggravate
the
guilt
of
his
perfidy
and
dishonour
this
pretext
of
friendly
concern
is
the
most
effectual
vehicle
for
the
conveyance
of
malice
and
slander
and
a
man
reputation
is
never
so
mortally
stabbed
as
when
the
assassin
begins
with
the
preamble
of
for
my
own
part
i
can
safely
say
that
no
man
upon
earth
has
a
greater
regard
for
him
than
i
have
and
it
is
with
the
utmost
anguish
and
concern
that
i
see
him
misbehave
in
such
a
then
he
proceeds
to
mangle
his
character
and
the
hearers
concluding
he
is
even
blacker
than
he
is
represented
on
the
supposition
that
the
most
atrocious
circumstances
are
softened
or
suppressed
by
the
tenderness
or
friendship
of
the
accuser
exclaim
good
lack
what
a
wretch
he
must
be
when
his
best
friends
will
no
longer
attempt
to
defend
him
nay
sometimes
these
undertake
his
defence
and
treacherously
betray
the
cause
they
have
espoused
by
omitting
the
reasons
that
may
be
urged
in
his
vindication
both
these
methods
were
practised
by
the
wily
ferdinand
according
to
the
predominant
passion
of
monimia
when
her
indignation
prevailed
he
expatiated
upon
his
love
and
sincere
regard
for
renaldo
which
he
said
had
grown
up
from
the
cradle
to
such
a
degree
of
fervour
that
he
would
willingly
part
with
life
for
his
advantage
he
shed
tears
for
his
apostasy
but
every
drop
made
an
indelible
stain
upon
his
character
and
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
swore
notwithstanding
his
fondness
for
renaldo
which
had
become
a
part
of
his
constitution
that
the
young
hungarian
deserved
the
most
infamous
destiny
for
having
injured
such
perfection
at
other
times
when
he
found
her
melted
into
silent
sorrow
he
affected
to
excuse
the
conduct
of
his
friend
he
informed
her

had
been
uneven
from
his
infancy
that
frailty
was
natural
to
man
that
he
might
in
time
be
reclaimed
by
he
even
hinted
that
she
might
have
probably
ascribed
to
inconstancy
what
was
really
the
effect
of
some
chagrin
which
he
industriously
concealed
from
his
participation
but
when
he
found
her
disposed
to
listen
to
this
last
suggestion
he
destroyed
the
force
of
it
by
recollecting
the
circumstances
of
his
nocturnal
rambles
which
he
owned
would
admit
of
no
favourable
construction
by
these
means
he
blew
the
coals
of
her
jealousy
and
enhanced
the
value
of
his
own
character
at
the
same
time
for
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
mirror
of
faith
and
integrity
and
the
mind
being
overcharged
with
woe
naturally
seeks
some
confidant
upon
whose
sympathy
it
can
repose
itself
indeed
his
great
aim
was
to
make
himself
necessary
to
her
affliction
and
settle
a
gossiping
correspondence
in
the
familiarity
of
which
he
hoped
his
purpose
would
certainly
be
answered
yet
the
exertion
of
these
talents
was
not
limited
to
her
alone
while
he
laid
these
trains
for
the
hapless
young
lady
he
was
preparing
snares
of
another
kind
for
her
unsuspecting
lover
who
for
the
completion
of
his
misery
about
this
time
began
to
perceive
marks
of
disquiet
and
displeasure
in
the
countenance
and
deportment
of
his
adored
monimia
for
that
young
lady
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
remembered
her
origin
and
over
her
vexation
affected
to
throw
a
veil
of
tranquillity
which
served
only
to
give
an
air
of
disgust
to
her
internal
disturbance
renaldo
whose
patience
and
philosophy
were
barely
sufficient
to
bear
the
load
of
his
other
evils
would
have
been
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
additional
burden
of
monimia
woe
if
it
had
not
assumed
this
appearance
of
disesteem
which
as
he
knew
he
had
not
deserved
it
brought
his
resentment
to
his
assistance
yet
this
was
but
a
wretched
cordial
to
support
him
against
the
baleful
reflections
that
assaulted
him
from
every
quarter
it
operated
like
those
desperate
remedies
which
while
they
stimulate
exhausted
nature
help
to
destroy
the
very
fundamentals
of
the
constitution
he
reviewed
his
own
conduct
with
the
utmost
severity
and
could
not
recollect
one
circumstance
which
could
justly
offend
the
idol
of
his
soul
the
more
blameless
he
appeared
to
himself
in
this
examination
the
less
excusable
did
her
behaviour
appear
he
tasked
his
penetration
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
alteration
he
burned
with
impatience
to
know
it
his
discernment
failed
him
and
he
was
afraid
though
he
knew
not
why
to
demand
an
explanation
his
thoughts
were
so
circumstanced
that
he
durst
not
even
unbosom
himself
to
fathom
though
his
own
virtue
and
friendship
resisted
those
sentiments
that
began
to
intrude
upon
his
mind
with
suggestions
to
the
prejudice
of
our
adventurer
fidelity
nevertheless
unable
to
endure
the
torments
of
such
interesting
suspense
he
at
length
made
an
effort
to
expostulate
with
the
fair
orphan
and
in
an
abrupt
address
the
effect
of
his
fear
and
confusion
begged
to
know
if
he
had
inadvertently
done
anything
to
incur
her
displeasure
monimia
hearing
herself
bluntly
accosted
in
this
unusual
strain
after
repeated
instances
of
his
reserve
and
supposed
inconstancy
considered
the
question
as
a
fresh
insult
and
summoning
her
whole
pride
to
her
assistance
replied
with
affected
tranquillity
or
rather
with
an
air
of
scorn
that
she
had
no
title
to
judge
neither
did
she
pretend
to
condemn
his
conduct
this
answer
so
wide
of
that
tenderness
and
concern
which
had
hitherto
manifested
itself
in
the
disposition
of
his
amiable
mistress
deprived
him
of
all
power
to
carry
on
the
conversation
and
he
retired
with
a
low
bow
fully
convinced
of
his
having
irretrievably
lost
the
place
he
had
possessed
in
her
affection
for
to
his
imagination
warped
and
blinded
by
his
misfortunes
her
demeanour
seemed
fraught
not
with
a
transient
gleam
of
anger
which
a
respectful
lover
would
soon
have
appeased
but
with
that
contempt
and
indifference
which
denote
a
total
absence
of
affection
and
esteem
she
on
the
other
hand
misconstrued
his
sudden
retreat
and
now
they
beheld
the
actions
of
each
other
through
the
false
medium
of
prejudice
and
resentment
to
such
fatal
misunderstandings
the
peace
and
happiness
of
whole
families
often
fall
a
sacrifice
chapter
our
adventurer
becomes
absolute
in
his
power
over
the
passions
of
his
friend
and
effects
one
half
of
his
aim
influenced
by
this
dire
mistake
the
breast
of
those
unhappy
lovers
began
to
be
invaded
with
the
horrors
of
jealousy
the
monimia
endeavoured
to
devour
her
griefs
in
silence
she
in
secret
bemoaned
her
forlorn
fate
without
ceasing
her
tears
flowed
without
intermission
from
night
to
morn
and
from
morn
to
night
she
sought
not
to
know
the
object
for
which
she
was
forsaken
she
meant
not
to
upbraid
her
undoer
her
aim
was
to
find
a
sequestered
corner
in
which
she
could
indulge
her
sorrow
where
she
could
brood
over
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
her
former
felicity
where
she
could
recollect
those
happy
scenes
she
had
enjoyed
under
the
wings
of
her
indulgent
parents
when
her
whole
life
was
a
revolution
of
pleasures
and
she
was
surrounded
with
affluence
pomp
and
admiration
where
she
could
unmolested
dwell
upon
the
wretched
comparison
between
her
past
and
present
condition
and
paint
every
circumstance
of
her
misery
in
the
most
aggravating
colours
that
they
might
make
the
deeper
impression
upon
her
mind
and
the
more
speedily
contribute
to
that
dissolution
for
which
she
ardently
wished
as
a
total
release
from
woe
amidst
these
pinings
she
began
to
loathe
all
sustenance
her
cheeks
grew
wan
her
bright
eyes
lost
their
splendour
the
roses
vanished
from
her
lips
and
her
delicate
limbs
could
hardly
support
their
burden
in
a
word
her
sole
consolation
was
limited
to
the
prospect
of
depositing
her
sorrows
in
the
grave
and
her
only
wish
was
to
procure
a
retreat
in
which
she
might
wait
with
resignation
for
that
happy
period
yet
this
melancholy
comfort
she
could
not
obtain
without
the
advice
and
mediation
of
fathom
whom
she
therefore
still
continued
to
see
and
consult
while
these
consultations
were
held
renaldo
bosom
was
ravaged
with
tempests
of
rage
and
distraction
he
believed
himself
superseded
in
the
affection
of
his
mistress
by
some
favoured
rival
whose
success
rankled
at
his
soul
and
though
he
scarce
durst
communicate
the
suspicion
to
his
own
heart
his
observation
continually
whispered
to
him
that
he
was
supplanted
by
his
friend
fathom
for
monimia
was
totally
detached
from
the
conversation
of
every
other
man
and
he
had
of
late
noted
their
intercourse
with
distempered
eyes
these
considerations
sometimes
transported
him
to
such
a
degree
of
frenzy
that
he
was
tempted
to
sacrifice
them
both
as
traitors
to
gratitude
friendship
and
love
but
such
deliriums
soon
vanished
before
his
honour
and
humanity
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
think
amiss
of
ferdinand
until
some
undoubted
mark
of
his
guilt
should
appear
and
this
was
so
far
from
being
the
case
that
hitherto
there
was
scarce
a
presumption
on
the
contrary
said
he
to
himself
i
am
hourly
receiving
proofs
of
his
sympathy
and
attachment
not
but
that
he
may
be
the
innocent
cause
of
my
mishap
his
superior
qualifications
may
have
attracted
the
eye
and
engaged
the
heart
of
that
inconstant
fair
without
his
being
sensible
of
the
victory
he
has
won
or
perhaps
shocked
at
the
conquest
he
hath
unwillingly
made
he
discourages
her
advances
tries
to
reason
down
her
unjustifiable
passion
and
in
the
meantime
conceals
from
me
the
particulars
out
of
regard
to
my
happiness
and
under
cover
of
these
favourable
conjectures
our
adventurer
securely
prosecuted
his
scheme
upon
the
unfortunate
monimia
he
dedicated
himself
wholly
to
her
service
and
conversation
except
at
those
times
when
his
company
was
requested
by
renaldo
who
now
very
seldom
exacted
his
attendance
in
his
ministry
about
the
person
of
the
beauteous
orphan
this
cunning
incendiary
mingled
such
awful
regard
such
melting
compassion
as
effectually
screened
him
from
the
suspicion
of
treachery
while
he
widened
the
fatal
breach
between
her
and
her
lover
by
the
most
diabolical
insinuations
he
represented
his
friend
as
a
voluptuary
who
gratified
his
own
appetite
without
the
least
regard
to
honour
or
conscience
and
with
a
show
of
infinite
reluctance
imparted
some
anecdotes
of
his
sensuality
which
he
had
feigned
for
the
purpose
then
he
would
exclaim
in
an
affected
transport
gracious
heaven
is
it
possible
for
any
man
who
has
the
least
title
to
perception
or
humanity
to
injure
such
innocence
and
perfection
for
my
own
part
had
i
been
so
undeservedly
happy
heaven
and
earth
forgive
my
transports
madam
i
can
not
help
seeing
and
admiring
such
divine
attractions
i
can
not
help
resenting
your
wrongs
it
is
the
cause
of
virtue
i
espouse
it
ought
to
be
the
cause
of
every
honest
he
had
often
repeated
such
apostrophes
as
these
which
she
ascribed
to
nothing
else
than
sheer
benevolence
and
virtuous
indignation
and
actually
began
to
think
he
had
made
some
impression
upon
her
heart
not
that
he
now
entertained
the
hope
of
an
immediate
triumph
over
her
chastity
the
more
he
contemplated
her
character
the
more
difficult
the
conquest
seemed
to
be
he
therefore
altered
his
plan
and
resolved
to
carry
on
his
operations
under
the
shelter
of
honourable
proposals
foreseeing
that
a
wife
of
her
qualifications
if
properly
managed
would
turn
greatly
to
the
account
of
the
husband
or
if
her
virtue
should
prove
refractory
that
he
could
at
any
time
rid
himself
of
the
encumbrance
by
decamping
without
beat
of
drum
after
he
should
be
cloyed
with
possession
elevated
by
these
expectations
he
one
day
in
the
midst
of
a
preconcerted
rhapsody
importing
that
he
could
no
longer
conceal
the
fire
that
preyed
upon
his
heart
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
lovely
mourner
and
imprinted
a
kiss
on
her
fair
hand
though
he
did
not
presume
to
take
this
liberty
till
after
such
preparation
as
he
thought
had
altogether
extinguished
her
regard
for
melvil
and
paved
the
way
for
his
own
reception
in
room
of
that
discarded
lover
he
had
so
far
overshot
his
mark
that
monimia
instead
of
favouring
his
declaration
started
up
and
retired
in
silence
her
cheeks
glowing
with
shame
and
her
eyes
gleaming
with
indignation
ferdinand
no
sooner
recovered
from
the
confusion
produced
by
this
unexpected
repulse
than
he
saw
the
necessity
of
coming
to
a
speedy
determination
lest
the
offended
fair
one
should
appeal
to
renaldo
in
which
case
they
might
be
mutually
undeceived
to
his
utter
shame
and
confusion
he
therefore
resolved
to
deprecate
her
anger
by
humble
supplications
and
by
protesting
that
whatever
tortures
he
might
suffer
by
suppressing
his
sentiments
she
should
never
again
be
offended
with
a
declaration
of
his
passion
having
thus
appeased
the
gentle
monimia
and
discovered
that
in
spite
of
her
resentment
his
friend
still
kept
possession
of
her
heart
he
determined
to
work
an
effectual
separation
so
as
that
the
young
lady
being
utterly
deserted
by
melvil
should
be
left
altogether
in
his
power
with
this
christian
intention
he
began
to
sadden
his
visage
with
a
double
shade
of
pensive
melancholy
in
the
presence
of
renaldo
to
stifle
a
succession
of
involuntary
sighs
to
answer
from
the
purpose
to
be
incoherent
in
his
discourse
and
in
a
word
to
act
the
part
of
a
person
wrapt
up
in
sorrowful
cogitation
count
melvil
soon
as
he
perceived
these
symptoms
very
kindly
inquired
into
the
cause
of
them
and
was
not
a
little
alarmed
to
hear
the
artful
and
evasive
answers
of
ferdinand
who
without
disclosing
the
source
of
his
disquiet
earnestly
begged
leave
to
retire
into
some
other
corner
of
the
world
roused
by
this
entreaty
the
hungarian
jealousy
awoke
and
with
violent
agitation
he
exclaimed
then
are
my
fears
too
true
my
dear
fathom
i
comprehend
the
meaning
of
your
request
i
have
for
some
time
perceived
an
host
of
horrors
approaching
from
that
quarter
i
know
your
worth
and
honour
i
depend
upon
your
friendship
and
conjure
you
by
all
the
ties
of
it
to
free
me
at
once
from
the
most
miserable
suspense
by
owning
you
have
involuntarily
captivated
the
heart
of
that
unhappy
to
this
solemn
interrogation
he
made
no
reply
but
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
of
which
he
had
always
a
magazine
at
command
he
repeated
his
desire
of
withdrawing
and
took
god
to
witness
that
what
he
proposed
was
solely
for
the
quiet
of
his
honoured
patron
and
beloved
friend
enough
cried
the
unfortunate
renaldo
the
measure
of
my
woes
is
now
filled
so
saying
he
fell
backwards
in
a
swoon
from
which
he
was
with
difficulty
recovered
to
the
sensation
of
the
most
exquisite
torments
during
this
paroxysm
our
adventurer
nursed
him
with
infinite
care
and
tenderness
he
exhorted
him
to
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
his
assistance
to
remember
his
forefathers
and
exert
himself
in
the
imitation
of
their
virtues
to
fly
from
those
bewitching
charms
which
had
enslaved
his
better
part
to
retrieve
his
peace
of
mind
by
reflecting
on
the
inconstancy
and
ingratitude
of
woman
and
amuse
his
imagination
in
the
pursuit
of
honour
and
glory
after
these
admonitions
he
abused
his
ears
with
a
forged
detail
of
the
gradual
advances
made
to
him
by
monimia
and
the
steps
he
had
taken
to
discourage
her
addresses
and
her
virtue
poisoning
the
mind
of
that
credulous
youth
to
such
a
degree
that
in
all
probability
he
would
have
put
a
fatal
period
to
his
own
existence
had
not
fathom
found
means
to
allay
the
rage
of
his
ecstasy
by
the
cunning
arrangement
of
opposite
considerations
he
set
his
pride
against
his
love
he
opposed
his
resentment
to
his
sorrow
and
his
ambition
to
his
despair
notwithstanding
the
balance
of
power
so
settled
among
these
antagonists
so
violent
were
the
shocks
of
their
successive
conflicts
that
his
bosom
fared
like
a
wretched
province
harassed
depopulated
and
laid
waste
by
two
fierce
contending
armies
from
this
moment
his
life
was
nothing
but
an
alternation
of
starts
and
reveries
he
wept
and
raved
by
turns
according
to
the
prevailing
gust
of
passion
food
became
a
stranger
to
his
lips
and
sleep
to
his
eyelids
he
could
not
support
the
presence
of
monimia
her
absence
increased
the
torture
of
his
pangs
and
when
he
met
her
by
accident
he
started
back
with
horror
like
a
traveller
who
chances
to
tread
upon
a
snake
the
poor
afflicted
orphan
worn
to
a
shadow
with
anguish
eager
to
find
some
lowly
retreat
where
she
could
breath
out
her
soul
in
peace
and
terrified
at
the
frantic
behaviour
of
renaldo
communicated
to
fathom
her
desire
of
removing
and
begged
that
he
would
take
a
small
picture
of
her
father
decorated
with
diamonds
and
convert
them
into
money
for
the
expense
of
her
subsistence
this
was
the
last
pledge
of
her
family
which
she
had
received
from
her
mother
who
had
preserved
it
in
the
midst
of
numberless
distresses
and
no
other
species
of
misery
but
that
which
she
groaned
under
could
have
prevailed
upon
the
daughter
to
part
with
it
but
exclusive
of
other
motives
the
very
image
itself
by
recalling
to
her
mind
the
honours
of
her
name
upbraided
her
with
living
in
dependence
upon
a
man
who
had
treated
her
with
such
indignity
and
ingratitude
besides
she
flattered
herself
with
the
hope
that
she
should
not
long
survive
the
loss
of
this
testimonial
our
adventurer
with
many
professions
of
sorrow
and
mortification
at
his
own
want
of
capacity
to
prevent
such
an
alienation
undertook
to
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
and
to
provide
her
with
a
cheap
and
retired
apartment
to
which
he
would
conduct
her
in
safety
though
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
in
the
meantime
however
he
repaired
to
his
friend
renaldo
and
after
having
admonished
him
to
arm
his
soul
with
patience
and
philosophy
declared
that
monimia
guilty
passion
for
himself
could
no
longer
be
kept
within
bounds
that
she
had
conjured
him
in
the
most
pressing
manner
to
assist
her
in
escaping
from
an
house
which
she
considered
as
the
worst
of
dungeons
because
she
was
in
it
daily
exposed
to
the
sight
and
company
of
a
man
whom
she
detested
and
that
she
had
bribed
him
to
compliance
with
her
request
not
only
with
repeated
promises
of
eternal
love
and
submission
but
also
with
the
picture
of
her
father
set
with
diamonds
which
she
had
hitherto
reserved
as
the
last
and
greatest
testimony
of
her
affection
and
esteem
with
these
words
he
presented
the
fatal
pledge
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
youth
upon
whom
it
operated
like
the
poisonous
sight
of
the
basilisk
for
in
an
instant
the
whole
passions
of
his
soul
were
in
the
most
violent
agitation
what
cried
he
in
an
ecstasy
of
rage
is
she
so
abandoned
to
perfidy
so
lost
to
shame
so
damned
to
constancy
to
gratitude
and
virtuous
love
as
to
meditate
the
means
of
leaving
me
without
decency
without
remorse
to
forsake
me
in
my
adversity
when
my
hapless
fortune
can
no
longer
flatter
the
pride
and
vanity
of
her
expectation
o
woman
woman
woman
what
simile
shall
i
find
to
illustrate
the
character
of
the
sex
but
i
will
not
have
recourse
to
vain
complaints
and
feeble
exclamations
by
heaven
she
shall
not
she
shall
not
triumph
in
her
levity
she
shall
not
exult
in
my
distress
no
i
will
rather
sacrifice
her
to
my
just
resentment
to
the
injured
powers
of
love
and
friendship
i
will
act
the
avenging
minister
of
heaven
i
will
mangle
that
fair
bosom
which
contains
so
false
a
heart
i
will
tear
her
to
pieces
and
scatter
those
beauteous
limbs
as
a
prey
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
fathom
who
expected
this
storm
far
from
attempting
to
oppose
its
progress
waited
with
patience
until
its
first
violence
was
overblown
then
assuming
an
air
of
condolence
animated
with
that
resolution
which
a
friend
ought
to
maintain
on
such
occasions
my
dear
count
said
he
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
your
emotion
because
i
know
what
an
heart
susceptible
as
yours
must
feel
from
the
apostasy
of
one
who
has
reigned
so
long
the
object
of
your
love
admiration
and
esteem
your
endeavours
to
drive
her
from
your
thoughts
must
create
an
agony
much
more
severe
than
that
which
divorces
the
soul
from
the
body
nevertheless
i
am
so
confident
of
your
virtue
and
your
manhood
as
to
foresee
that
you
will
allow
the
fair
monimia
to
execute
that
resolution
which
she
hath
so
unwisely
taken
to
withdraw
herself
from
your
love
and
protection
believe
me
my
best
friend
and
benefactor
this
is
a
step
in
consequence
of
which
you
will
infallibly
retrieve
your
peace
of
mind
it
may
cost
you
many
bitter
pangs
it
may
probe
your
wounds
to
the
quick
but
those
pangs
will
be
soothed
by
the
gentle
and
salutary
wing
of
time
and
that
probing
will
rouse
you
to
a
due
sense
of
your
own
dignity
and
importance
which
will
enable
you
to
convert
your
attention
to
objects
far
more
worthy
of
your
contemplation
all
the
hopes
of
happiness
you
had
cherished
in
the
possession
of
monimia
are
now
irrecoverably
blasted
her
heart
is
now
debased
beneath
your
consideration
her
love
is
without
all
doubt
extinguished
and
her
honour
irretrievably
lost
insomuch
that
were
she
to
profess
sorrow
for
her
indiscretion
and
implore
your
forgiveness
with
the
most
solemn
promises
of
regarding
you
for
the
future
with
unalterable
fidelity
and
affection
you
ought
not
to
restore
her
to
that
place
in
your
heart
which
she
hath
so
meanly
forfeited
because
you
could
not
at
the
same
time
reinstate
her
in
the
possession
of
that
delicate
esteem
without
which
there
is
no
harmony
no
rapture
no
true
enjoyment
in
love
no
my
dear
renaldo
expel
the
unworthy
tenant
from
your
bosom
allow
her
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
her
ingratitude
by
deserting
her
lover
friend
and
benefactor
your
glory
demands
her
dismission
the
world
will
applaud
your
generosity
and
your
own
heart
approve
of
your
conduct
so
disencumbered
let
us
exert
ourselves
once
more
in
promoting
your
departure
from
this
island
that
you
may
revisit
your
father
house
do
justice
to
yourself
and
amiable
sister
and
take
vengeance
on
the
author
of
your
wrongs
then
dedicate
yourself
to
glory
in
imitation
of
your
renowned
ancestors
and
flourish
in
the
favour
of
your
imperial
these
remonstrances
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
hungarian
that
his
face
was
lighted
up
with
a
transient
gleam
of
satisfaction
he
embraced
ferdinand
with
great
ardour
calling
him
his
pride
his
mentor
his
good
genius
and
entreated
him
to
gratify
the
inclination
of
that
fickle
creature
so
far
as
to
convey
her
to
another
lodging
without
loss
of
time
while
he
would
by
absenting
himself
favour
their
retreat
our
hero
having
obtained
this
permission
went
immediately
to
the
skirts
of
the
town
where
he
had
previously
bespoke
a
small
though
neat
apartment
at
the
house
of
an
old
woman
widow
of
a
french
refugee
he
had
already
reconnoitred
the
ground
by
sounding
his
landlady
from
whose
poverty
and
complaisance
he
found
reason
to
expect
all
sorts
of
freedom
and
opportunity
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
aim
upon
monimia
person
the
room
being
prepared
for
her
reception
he
returned
to
that
disconsolate
beauty
to
whom
he
presented
ten
guineas
which
he
pretended
to
have
raised
by
pledging
the
picture
though
he
himself
acted
as
the
pawnbroker
on
this
occasion
for
a
very
plain
and
obvious
reason
the
fair
orphan
was
overjoyed
to
find
her
wish
so
speedily
accomplished
she
forthwith
packed
up
her
necessaries
in
a
trunk
and
a
was
called
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
in
which
she
embarked
with
her
baggage
and
conductor
yet
she
did
not
leave
the
habitation
of
renaldo
without
regret
in
the
instant
of
parting
the
idea
of
that
unfortunate
youth
was
associated
with
every
object
that
presented
itself
to
her
eyes
not
as
an
inconstant
ungenerous
and
perjured
swain
but
as
the
accomplished
the
virtuous
the
melting
lover
who
had
captivated
her
virgin
heart
as
fathom
led
her
to
the
door
she
was
met
by
renaldo
dog
which
had
long
been
her
favourite
and
the
poor
animal
fawning
upon
her
as
she
passed
her
heart
was
overwhelmed
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
that
a
flood
of
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
and
she
had
sunk
upon
the
floor
ferdinand
considering
this
emotion
as
the
last
tribute
she
would
pay
to
renaldo
hurried
her
into
the
coach
where
she
soon
recovered
her
composure
and
in
a
little
time
he
ushered
her
into
the
house
of
madam
la
mer
by
whom
she
was
received
with
great
cordiality
and
conducted
to
her
apartment
with
which
she
found
no
other
fault
than
that
of
its
being
too
good
for
one
in
her
forlorn
situation
here
while
the
tear
of
gratitude
started
in
either
eye
she
thanked
our
adventurer
for
his
benevolence
and
kind
concern
assuring
him
that
she
would
not
fail
duly
to
beseech
the
most
high
to
shower
down
blessings
upon
him
as
the
orphan
friend
and
protector
fathom
was
not
deficient
in
those
expressions
that
were
best
adapted
to
her
present
turn
of
mind
he
observed
that
what
he
had
done
was
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
common
humanity
which
would
have
prompted
him
to
assist
any
in
distress
but
that
her
peculiar
virtue
and
qualifications
were
such
as
challenged
the
utmost
exertion
of
his
faculties
in
her
service
he
said
that
surely
heaven
had
not
created
such
perfection
in
vain
that
she
was
destined
to
receive
as
well
as
to
communicate
happiness
and
that
the
providence
which
she
so
piously
adored
would
not
fail
in
due
season
to
raise
her
from
distress
and
affliction
to
that
honour
and
felicity
for
which
she
was
certainly
ordained
in
the
meantime
he
entreated
her
to
depend
upon
his
service
and
fidelity
and
the
article
of
her
board
being
settled
he
left
her
to
the
company
and
consolation
of
her
discreet
hostess
who
soon
insinuated
herself
into
the
good
opinion
of
her
beauteous
lodger
while
our
hero
was
employed
in
this
transaction
renaldo
sallied
forth
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
which
fathom
admonitions
had
inspired
and
repairing
to
a
certain
noted
engaged
at
chess
with
an
old
french
refugee
that
his
attention
by
being
otherwise
employed
might
not
stray
towards
that
fatal
object
which
he
ardently
wished
to
forget
but
unluckily
for
him
he
had
scarce
performed
three
moves
of
the
game
when
his
ears
were
exposed
to
a
dialogue
between
two
young
gentlemen
one
of
whom
asked
the
other
if
he
would
go
and
see
the
orphan
acted
at
one
of
the
theatres
observing
as
a
farther
inducement
that
the
part
of
monimia
would
be
performed
by
a
young
gentlewoman
who
had
never
appeared
on
the
stage
at
mention
of
that
name
renaldo
started
for
though
it
did
not
properly
belong
to
his
orphan
it
was
the
appellation
by
which
she
had
been
distinguished
ever
since
her
separation
from
her
house
and
therefore
it
recalled
her
to
his
imagination
in
the
most
interesting
point
of
view
though
he
endeavoured
to
expel
the
image
by
a
closer
application
to
his
play
every
now
and
then
it
intruded
upon
his
fancy
and
at
each
return
made
a
stronger
impression
so
that
he
found
himself
in
the
situation
of
an
unfortunate
bark
stranded
upon
some
hidden
rock
which
when
the
wind
begins
to
blow
feels
every
succeeding
wave
more
boisterous
than
the
former
until
with
irresistible
fury
they
surmount
her
deck
sweep
everything
before
them
and
dash
her
all
to
pieces
the
refugee
had
observed
his
first
emotion
which
he
attributed
to
an
unforeseen
advantage
he
himself
had
gained
over
the
hungarian
but
seeing
him
in
the
sequel
bite
his
lip
roll
his
eyes
groan
writhe
his
body
ejaculate
incoherent
curses
and
neglect
his
game
the
huguenot
concluded
that
he
was
mad
and
being
seized
with
terror
and
dismay
got
up
and
scampered
off
without
ceremony
or
hesitation
melvil
thus
left
to
the
horrors
of
his
own
thought
which
tortured
him
with
the
apprehension
of
losing
monimia
for
ever
could
no
longer
combat
that
suggestion
but
ran
homewards
with
all
the
speed
he
could
exert
in
order
to
prevent
her
retreat
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
was
struck
with
such
a
damp
of
presaging
fear
that
he
durst
not
in
person
approach
her
apartment
nor
even
by
questioning
the
servant
inform
himself
of
the
particulars
he
wanted
to
know
yet
his
suspense
becoming
more
insupportable
than
his
fear
he
rushed
from
room
to
room
in
quest
of
that
which
was
not
to
be
found
and
seeing
monimia
chamber
door
open
entered
the
deserted
temple
in
a
state
of
distraction
calling
aloud
upon
her
name
all
was
silent
solitary
and
woful
she
is
gone
he
cried
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
she
is
for
ever
lost
and
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
are
fled
so
saying
he
sunk
upon
that
couch
on
which
monimia
had
oft
reposed
and
abandoned
himself
to
all
the
excess
of
grief
and
despondence
in
this
deplorable
condition
he
was
found
by
our
adventurer
who
gently
chid
him
for
his
want
of
resolution
and
again
repelled
his
sorrow
by
arousing
his
resentment
against
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disquiet
having
beforehand
forged
the
particulars
of
provocation
is
it
possible
said
he
that
renaldo
can
still
retain
the
least
sentiment
of
regard
for
a
fickle
woman
by
whom
he
has
been
so
ungratefully
forsaken
and
so
unjustly
scorned
is
it
possible
he
can
be
so
disturbed
by
the
loss
of
a
creature
who
is
herself
lost
to
all
virtue
and
decorum
time
and
reflection
my
worthy
friend
will
cure
you
of
that
inglorious
malady
and
the
future
misconduct
of
that
imprudent
damsel
will
doubtless
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
your
peace
her
behaviour
at
leaving
the
house
where
she
had
received
so
many
marks
of
the
most
delicate
affection
was
in
all
respects
so
opposite
to
honour
and
decency
that
i
could
scarce
refrain
from
telling
her
i
was
shocked
at
her
deportment
even
while
she
loaded
me
with
protestations
of
love
when
a
woman
heart
is
once
depraved
she
bids
adieu
to
all
restraint
she
preserves
no
measures
it
was
not
simply
contempt
which
she
expressed
for
renaldo
she
seems
to
resent
his
being
able
to
live
under
her
disdain
and
that
resentment
stoops
to
objects
unworthy
of
indignation
even
your
dog
was
not
exempted
from
the
effects
of
her
displeasure
for
in
her
passage
to
the
door
she
kicked
the
poor
animal
as
one
of
your
dependents
and
in
our
way
to
the
apartment
i
had
provided
for
her
she
entertained
me
with
a
ludicrous
comment
upon
the
manner
in
which
you
first
made
her
acquainted
with
your
passion
all
that
modesty
of
carriage
all
that
chastity
of
conversation
all
that
dignity
of
grief
which
she
knew
so
well
how
to
affect
is
now
entirely
laid
aside
and
when
i
quitted
her
she
seemed
the
most
gay
giddy
and
impertinent
of
her
gracious
powers
exclaimed
renaldo
starting
from
the
couch
am
i
under
the
delusion
of
a
dream
or
are
these
things
really
so
as
my
friend
has
represented
them
such
a
total
and
sudden
degeneracy
is
amazing
is
monstrous
and
unnatural
such
my
dear
count
replied
our
hero
is
the
caprice
of
a
female
heart
fickle
as
the
wind
uncertain
as
a
calm
at
sea
fixed
to
no
principle
but
swayed
by
every
fantastic
gust
of
passion
or
of
whim
congratulate
yourself
therefore
my
friend
upon
your
happy
deliverance
from
such
a
domestic
plague
upon
the
voluntary
exile
of
a
traitor
from
your
recollect
the
dictates
of
your
duty
your
discretion
and
your
glory
and
think
upon
the
honours
and
elevated
enjoyment
for
which
you
are
certainly
ordained
let
us
over
a
cheerful
bottle
anticipate
your
success
and
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
house
of
an
usurer
who
i
am
informed
fears
no
risk
provided
twenty
per
cent
be
given
and
the
borrower
life
chapter
the
art
of
borrowing
further
explained
and
an
account
of
a
strange
phenomenon
in
this
manner
did
the
artful
incendiary
work
upon
the
passions
of
the
credulous
unsuspecting
hungarian
who
pressed
him
to
his
breast
with
the
most
cordial
expressions
of
friendship
calling
him
his
guardian
his
saviour
his
second
father
and
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
his
advice
next
morning
according
to
the
plan
they
had
laid
overnight
they
repaired
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
person
to
whom
our
adventurer
had
been
directed
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
him
in
the
house
transacting
a
money
affair
with
a
young
gentleman
who
treated
him
with
his
morning
whet
that
affair
being
negotiated
he
adjourned
into
another
room
with
renaldo
and
his
companion
who
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
minister
of
plutus
in
the
shape
of
a
young
sprightly
beau
trimmed
up
in
all
the
foppery
of
the
fashion
for
they
had
hitherto
always
associated
with
the
idea
of
an
usurer
old
age
and
rusty
apparel
after
divers
modish
congees
he
begged
to
know
to
what
he
should
attribute
the
honour
of
their
message
when
ferdinand
who
acted
the
orator
told
him
that
his
friend
count
melvil
having
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money
had
been
directed
to
a
gentleman
of
his
name
and
i
suppose
added
he
you
are
the
son
of
the
person
with
whom
the
affair
is
to
be
sir
said
this
with
a
smile
i
perceive
you
are
surprised
to
see
one
of
my
profession
in
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
and
perhaps
your
wonder
will
not
cease
when
i
tell
you
that
my
education
was
liberal
and
that
i
once
had
the
honour
to
bear
a
commission
in
the
british
army
i
was
indeed
a
first
lieutenant
of
marines
and
will
venture
to
say
that
no
officer
in
the
service
was
more
delicate
than
myself
in
observing
all
the
punctilios
of
honour
i
entertained
the
utmost
contempt
for
all
the
trading
part
of
the
nation
and
suffered
myself
to
be
run
through
the
body
in
a
duel
rather
than
roll
with
a
who
was
a
broker
son
but
thank
heaven
i
have
long
ago
conquered
all
those
ridiculous
prejudices
i
soon
observed
that
without
money
there
was
no
respect
honour
or
convenience
to
be
acquired
in
life
that
wealth
amply
supplied
the
want
of
wit
merit
and
pedigree
having
influence
and
pleasure
ever
at
command
and
that
the
world
never
failed
to
worship
the
flood
of
affluence
without
examining
the
dirty
channels
through
which
it
commonly
flowed
at
the
end
of
the
war
finding
my
appointments
reduced
to
two
shillings
and
fourpence
per
day
and
being
addicted
to
pleasures
which
i
could
not
possibly
purchase
from
such
a
fund
i
sold
my
for
two
hundred
pounds
which
i
lent
upon
bond
to
a
young
officer
of
the
same
regiment
on
condition
that
he
should
insure
his
life
and
restore
part
of
the
sum
by
way
of
premium
i
happened
to
be
lucky
in
this
first
essay
for
the
borrower
having
in
six
weeks
expended
the
money
made
an
excursion
on
the
highway
was
apprehended
tried
convicted
of
felony
and
cut
his
own
throat
to
prevent
the
shame
of
a
public
execution
so
that
his
bond
was
discharged
by
the
insurers
in
short
gentlemen
when
i
engaged
in
this
business
i
determined
to
carry
it
on
with
such
spirit
as
would
either
make
my
fortune
or
entirely
ruin
me
in
a
little
time
and
hitherto
my
endeavours
have
been
tolerably
successful
nor
do
i
think
my
proceedings
a
whit
more
criminal
or
unjust
than
those
of
other
merchants
who
strive
to
turn
their
money
to
the
best
account
the
commodity
i
deal
in
is
cash
and
it
is
my
business
to
sell
it
to
the
best
advantage
a
london
factor
sends
a
cargo
of
goods
to
market
and
if
he
gets
two
hundred
per
cent
upon
the
sale
he
is
commended
for
industry
and
address
if
i
sell
money
for
part
of
that
profit
certain
persons
will
be
so
unjust
as
to
cry
shame
upon
me
for
taking
such
advantage
of
my
neighbour
distress
not
considering
that
the
trader
took
four
times
the
same
advantage
of
those
people
who
bought
his
cargo
though
his
risk
was
not
half
so
great
as
mine
and
although
the
money
i
sold
perhaps
retrieved
the
borrower
from
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
for
example
it
was
but
yesterday
i
saved
a
worthy
man
from
being
arrested
for
a
sum
of
money
for
which
he
had
bailed
a
friend
who
treacherously
left
him
in
the
lurch
as
he
did
not
foresee
what
would
happen
he
had
made
no
provision
for
the
demand
and
his
sphere
of
life
secluding
him
from
all
sorts
of
monied
intercourse
he
could
not
raise
the
cash
by
his
credit
in
the
usual
way
of
borrowing
so
that
without
my
assistance
he
must
have
gone
to
jail
a
disgrace
which
would
have
proved
fatal
to
the
peace
of
his
family
and
utterly
ruined
his
nay
that
very
young
gentleman
from
whom
i
am
just
now
parted
will
in
all
probability
be
indebted
to
me
for
a
very
genteel
livelihood
he
had
obtained
the
absolute
promise
of
being
provided
for
by
a
great
man
who
sits
at
the
helm
of
affairs
in
a
neighbouring
kingdom
but
being
destitute
of
all
other
resources
he
could
not
have
equipped
himself
for
the
voyage
in
order
to
profit
by
his
intention
unless
i
had
enabled
him
to
pursue
his
good
renaldo
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
this
harangue
to
which
fathom
replied
with
many
florid
encomiums
upon
the
usurer
good
sense
and
humane
disposition
then
he
explained
the
errand
of
his
friend
which
was
to
borrow
three
hundred
pounds
in
order
to
retrieve
his
inheritance
of
which
he
had
been
defrauded
in
his
absence
sir
said
the
lender
addressing
himself
to
count
melvil
i
pretend
to
have
acquired
by
experience
some
skill
in
physiognomy
and
though
there
are
some
faces
so
deeply
disguised
as
to
baffle
all
the
penetration
of
our
art
there
are
others
in
which
the
heart
appears
with
such
nakedness
of
integrity
as
at
once
to
recommend
it
to
our
goodwill
i
own
your
countenance
prepossesses
me
in
your
favour
and
you
shall
be
accommodated
upon
those
terms
from
which
i
never
deviate
provided
you
can
find
proper
security
that
you
shall
not
quit
the
british
dominions
for
that
with
me
is
a
condition
sine
qua
this
was
a
very
disagreeable
declaration
to
renaldo
who
candidly
owned
that
as
his
concerns
lay
upon
the
continent
his
purpose
was
to
leave
england
without
delay
the
usurer
professed
himself
sorry
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
oblige
him
and
in
order
to
prevent
any
further
importunity
assured
them
he
had
laid
it
down
as
a
maxim
from
which
he
would
never
swerve
to
avoid
all
dealings
with
people
whom
if
need
should
be
he
could
not
sue
by
the
laws
of
this
realm
thus
the
intervention
of
one
unlucky
and
unforeseen
circumstance
blasted
in
an
instant
the
budding
hopes
of
melvil
who
while
his
visage
exhibited
the
most
sorrowful
disappointment
begged
to
know
if
there
was
any
person
of
his
acquaintance
who
might
be
less
scrupulous
in
that
particular
the
young
gentleman
directed
them
to
another
member
of
his
profession
and
wishing
them
success
took
his
leave
with
great
form
and
complaisance
this
instance
of
politeness
was
however
no
more
than
a
shift
to
disengage
himself
the
more
easily
from
their
entreaties
for
when
the
case
was
opened
to
the
second
usurer
he
blessed
himself
from
such
customers
and
dismissed
them
with
the
most
mortifying
and
boorish
refusal
notwithstanding
these
repulses
renaldo
resolved
to
make
one
desperate
push
and
without
allowing
himself
the
least
respite
solicited
one
by
one
not
fewer
than
fifteen
persons
who
dealt
in
this
kind
of
traffic
and
his
proposals
were
rejected
by
each
at
last
fatigued
by
the
toil
and
exasperated
at
the
ill
success
of
his
expedition
and
half
mad
with
the
recollection
of
his
finances
which
were
now
drained
to
since
we
have
nothing
to
expect
cried
he
from
the
favour
of
christians
let
us
have
recourse
to
the
descendants
of
judah
though
they
lie
under
the
general
reproach
of
nations
as
a
people
dead
to
virtue
and
benevolence
and
wholly
devoted
to
avarice
fraud
and
extortion
the
most
savage
of
their
tribe
can
not
treat
me
with
more
barbarity
of
indifference
than
i
have
experienced
among
those
who
are
the
authors
of
their
although
fathom
looked
upon
this
proposal
as
an
extravagant
symptom
of
despair
he
affected
to
approve
of
the
scheme
and
encouraged
renaldo
with
the
hope
of
succeeding
in
another
quarter
even
if
this
expedition
should
fail
for
by
this
time
our
adventurer
was
half
resolved
to
export
him
at
his
own
charge
rather
than
he
should
be
much
longer
restricted
in
his
designs
upon
monimia
meanwhile
being
resolved
to
try
the
experiment
upon
the
children
of
israel
they
betook
themselves
to
the
house
of
a
rich
jew
whose
wealth
they
considered
as
a
proof
of
his
rapaciousness
and
being
admitted
into
his
they
found
him
in
the
midst
of
half
a
dozen
clerks
when
renaldo
in
his
imagination
likened
him
unto
a
minister
of
darkness
surrounded
by
his
familiars
and
planning
schemes
of
misery
to
be
executed
upon
the
hapless
sons
of
men
in
spite
of
these
suggestions
which
were
not
at
all
mitigated
by
the
forbidding
aspect
of
the
hebrew
he
demanded
a
private
audience
and
being
ushered
into
another
apartment
he
explained
his
business
with
manifest
marks
of
disorder
and
affliction
indeed
his
confusion
was
in
some
measure
owing
to
the
looks
of
the
jew
who
in
the
midst
of
this
exordium
pulled
down
his
eyebrows
which
were
surprisingly
black
and
bushy
so
as
in
appearance
totally
to
extinguish
his
visage
though
he
was
all
the
time
observing
our
youth
from
behind
those
almost
impenetrable
thickets
melvil
having
signified
his
request
young
gentleman
said
the
israelite
with
a
most
discordant
voice
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
could
induce
you
to
come
to
me
upon
such
an
errand
did
you
ever
hear
that
i
lent
money
to
strangers
without
security
no
replied
renaldo
nor
did
i
believe
i
should
profit
by
my
application
but
my
affairs
are
desperate
and
my
proposals
having
been
rejected
by
every
christian
to
whom
they
were
offered
i
was
resolved
to
try
my
fate
among
the
jews
who
are
reckoned
another
species
of
fathom
alarmed
at
this
abrupt
reply
which
he
supposed
could
not
fail
to
disgust
the
merchant
interposed
in
the
conversation
by
making
an
apology
for
the
plain
dealing
of
his
friend
who
he
said
was
soured
and
ruffled
by
his
misfortunes
then
exerting
that
power
of
eloquence
which
he
had
at
command
he
expostulated
upon
renaldo
claim
and
expectations
described
the
wrongs
he
had
suffered
extolled
his
virtue
and
drew
a
most
pathetic
picture
of
his
distress
the
jew
listened
attentively
for
some
time
then
his
eyebrows
began
to
rise
and
fall
alternately
he
coughed
sneezed
and
winking
hard
plagued
said
he
with
a
salt
rheum
that
trickles
from
my
eyes
without
so
saying
he
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
face
and
proceeded
in
these
words
sir
your
story
is
plausible
and
your
friend
is
a
good
advocate
but
before
i
give
an
answer
to
your
demand
i
must
beg
leave
to
ask
if
you
can
produce
undeniable
evidence
of
your
being
the
identical
person
you
really
assume
if
you
are
really
the
count
de
melvil
you
will
excuse
my
caution
we
can
not
be
too
much
on
our
guard
against
fraud
though
i
must
own
you
have
not
the
air
of
an
renaldo
eyes
began
to
sparkle
at
this
preliminary
question
to
which
he
replied
that
he
could
procure
the
testimony
of
the
emperor
minister
to
whom
he
had
occasionally
paid
his
respects
since
his
first
arrival
in
england
if
that
be
the
case
said
the
jew
take
the
trouble
to
call
here
morning
at
eight
and
i
will
carry
you
in
my
own
coach
to
the
house
of
his
excellency
with
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
and
if
he
has
nothing
to
object
against
your
character
or
pretensions
i
will
contribute
my
assistance
towards
your
obtaining
justice
at
the
imperial
the
hungarian
was
so
much
confounded
at
this
unexpected
reception
that
he
had
not
power
to
thank
the
merchant
for
his
promised
favour
but
stood
motionless
and
silent
while
the
streams
of
emotion
of
the
heart
was
of
more
weight
with
the
jew
than
the
eloquent
acknowledgment
which
ferdinand
took
the
opportunity
of
making
for
his
friend
and
he
was
fain
to
dismiss
them
a
little
abruptly
in
order
to
prevent
a
second
discharge
of
that
same
rheum
of
which
he
had
already
complained
melvil
recollected
all
that
had
happened
as
a
dream
which
had
no
foundation
in
truth
and
was
all
day
long
in
a
sort
of
delirium
produced
by
the
alternate
gusts
of
hope
and
fear
that
still
agitated
his
bosom
for
he
was
not
yet
without
apprehension
of
being
again
disappointed
by
some
unlucky
occurrence
he
did
not
however
fail
to
be
punctual
to
the
hour
of
his
appointment
when
the
jew
told
him
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
visiting
the
ambassador
because
renaldo
had
been
the
preceding
day
recognised
by
one
of
the
clerks
who
had
been
employed
as
a
purveyor
in
the
imperial
army
and
who
knowing
his
family
confirmed
everything
he
had
alleged
after
breakfast
continued
this
benevolent
israelite
i
will
give
you
an
order
upon
my
banker
for
five
hundred
pounds
that
you
may
be
enabled
to
appear
at
vienna
as
the
son
and
representative
of
count
melvil
and
you
shall
also
be
furnished
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
person
of
some
influence
at
that
court
whose
friendship
and
countenance
may
be
of
some
service
to
your
suit
for
i
am
now
heartily
engaged
in
your
interest
in
consequence
of
the
fair
and
unblemished
character
which
i
find
you
have
hitherto
the
reader
must
appeal
to
his
own
heart
to
acquire
a
just
idea
of
renaldo
feelings
when
every
tittle
of
these
promises
was
fulfilled
and
the
merchant
refused
to
take
one
farthing
by
way
of
premium
contenting
himself
with
the
slender
security
of
a
personal
bond
he
was
in
truth
overwhelmed
with
the
obligation
and
certainly
disposed
to
believe
that
his
benefactor
was
something
more
than
human
as
for
fathom
his
sentiments
took
a
different
turn
and
he
scrupled
not
to
impute
all
this
kindness
to
some
interested
scheme
the
scope
of
which
he
could
not
at
present
comprehend
after
the
tumults
of
the
young
gentleman
joy
had
subsided
and
he
found
himself
eased
of
that
burdensome
poverty
under
which
he
had
groaned
so
long
his
thoughts
which
before
were
dissipated
upon
the
various
circumstances
of
distress
began
to
collect
themselves
in
a
body
and
to
resume
their
deliberations
upon
a
subject
which
they
had
been
long
accustomed
to
consider
this
was
no
other
than
the
forlorn
monimia
whose
idea
now
emerged
in
his
bosom
being
disencumbered
of
one
part
of
the
load
by
which
it
had
been
depressed
he
mentioned
her
name
to
fathom
with
marks
of
the
most
melting
compassion
deplored
her
apostasy
and
while
he
protested
that
he
had
divorced
her
for
ever
from
his
heart
expressed
an
inclination
to
see
her
once
more
before
his
departure
that
he
might
in
person
exhort
her
to
penitence
and
reformation
our
adventurer
who
dreaded
such
an
interview
as
the
infallible
means
of
his
own
ruin
resisted
the
proposal
with
the
whole
power
of
his
elocution
he
affirmed
that
renaldo
desire
was
a
manifest
proof
that
he
still
retained
part
of
the
fatal
poison
which
that
enchantress
had
spread
within
his
veins
and
that
the
sight
of
her
softened
by
his
reproaches
into
tears
and
affected
contrition
would
dispel
his
resentment
disable
his
manhood
and
blow
the
embers
of
his
former
passion
to
such
a
rage
as
would
hurry
him
on
to
a
reconciliation
which
would
debase
his
honour
and
ruin
his
future
peace
in
a
word
ferdinand
described
the
danger
that
would
attend
the
meeting
in
such
emphatic
terms
that
the
hungarian
started
with
horror
at
the
picture
which
he
drew
and
in
this
particular
conformed
with
the
admonition
of
his
friend
one
hundred
pounds
of
the
jew
money
was
immediately
appropriated
for
the
payment
of
his
most
urgent
debts
the
like
sum
he
presented
to
his
friend
fathom
with
a
solemn
promise
of
sharing
with
him
whatever
good
fortune
might
await
him
in
germany
and
though
monimia
had
forfeited
all
title
to
his
regard
so
ill
could
he
bear
the
prospect
of
her
distress
that
he
entrusted
his
dear
companion
with
the
half
of
what
remained
to
be
expended
for
her
use

to
screen

his

his
fortune
in
england
which
he
considered
as
his
native
country
and
as
the
land
in
which
of
all
others
a
man
of
merit
has
the
best
encouragement
such
were
the
reasons
he
alleged
for
refusing
to
attend
his
benefactor
who
was
himself
eagerly
desirous
of
attaining
a
settlement
in
the
island
of
great
britain
but
our
hero
real
motives
for
staying
were
of
a
very
different
the
reader
is
already
informed
of
his
aim
upon
the
fair
orphan
which
at
present
was
the
chief
spring
of
his
conduct
he
may
also
recollect
such
passages
of
his
life
as
were
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
reappearing
at
presburg
or
vienna
but
besides
these
reflections
he
was
detained
by
a
full
persuasion
that
renaldo
would
sink
under
the
power
and
influence
of
his
antagonist
consequently
be
rendered
incapable
to
provide
for
his
friends
and
that
he
himself
fraught
with
wiles
and
experience
as
he
was
could
not
fail
to
make
himself
amends
for
what
he
had
suffered
among
a
people
equally
rich
and
unthinking
melvil
having
embraced
our
adventurer
and
with
a
deep
sigh
bid
him
take
care
of
the
unfortunate
monimia
committed
himself
to
the
sea
and
by
the
assistance
of
a
favourable
gale
was
in
four
hours
safely
landed
on
the
french
shore
while
fathom
took
for
london
where
he
arrived
that
same
night
and
next
day
in
the
forenoon
went
to
visit
the
beauteous
mourner
who
had
as
yet
received
no
intimation
of
departure
or
design
he
found
her
in
the
attitude
of
writing
a
letter
to
her
inconstant
lover
the
contents
of
which
the
reader
will
be
acquainted
with
in
due
time
her
countenance
notwithstanding
the
veil
of
melancholy
by
which
it
was
overcast
seemed
altogether
serene
and
composed
she
was
the
picture
of
pious
resignation
and
sat
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
after
having
paid
the
compliment
of
the
morning
fathom
begged
pardon
for
having
omitted
to
visit
her
during
three
days
in
which
he
said
his
time
had
been
wholly
engrossed
in
procuring
a
proper
equipage
for
count
melvil
who
had
at
last
bid
an
eternal
adieu
to
the
island
of
great
britain
at
this
information
the
hapless
monimia
fell
back
in
her
chair
and
continued
some
minutes
in
a
swoon
from
which
being
recovered
excuse
me
fathom
cried
she
with
a
deep
sigh
this
i
hope
is
the
last
agony
i
shall
feel
from
my
unhappy
then
wiping
the
tears
from
her
lovely
eyes
she
retrieved
her
tranquillity
and
desired
to
know
by
what
means
renaldo
had
been
enabled
to
undertake
his
journey
into
the
empire
our
hero
upon
this
occasion
assumed
the
whole
merit
of
having
promoted
the
interest
of
his
friend
by
giving
her
to
understand
that
he
in
consequence
of
an
unforeseen
windfall
had
defrayed
the
expense
of
the
count
equipment
though
he
observed
that
it
was
not
without
reluctance
he
saw
renaldo
make
a
wrong
use
of
his
friendship
although
i
was
happy
proceeded
this
artful
traitor
in
being
able
to
discharge
my
obligations
to
the
house
of
melvil
i
could
not
help
feeling
the
most
sensible
chagrin
when
i
saw
my
assistance
rendered
subservient
to
the
triumphs
of
the
youth
baseness
and
infidelity
for
he
chose
as
the
companion
of
his
travels
the
abandoned
woman
for
whom
he
had
forsaken
the
monimia
whose
virtue
and
accomplishments
did
not
preserve
her
sacred
from
his
ungrateful
sarcasms
and
unmannerly
ridicule
believe
me
madam
i
was
so
shocked
at
his
conversation
on
that
subject
and
so
much
incensed
at
his
want
of
delicacy
that
my
temper
was
scarce
sufficient
for
the
ceremony
of
parting
and
now
that
my
debt
to
his
family
is
i
have
solemnly
renounced
his
when
she
heard
that
instead
of
betraying
the
least
symptom
of
regret
or
compassion
for
her
unhappy
fate
the
perfidious
youth
had
exulted
over
her
fall
and
even
made
her
a
subject
for
his
mirth
the
blood
revisited
her
faded
cheeks
and
resentment
restored
to
her
eyes
that
poignancy
which
sorrow
had
before
overcome
yet
she
scorned
to
give
speech
to
her
indignation
but
forcing
a
smile
why
should
i
repine
said
she
at
the
mortifications
of
a
life
which
i
despise
and
from
which
i
hope
heaven
speedily
will
set
me
free
fathom
fired
by
her
emotion
which
had
recalled
all
the
graces
of
her
beauty
exclaimed
in
a
rapture
talk
not
so
contemptuously
of
this
life
which
hath
still
a
fund
of
happiness
in
store
for
the
amiable
the
divine
monimia
though
one
admirer
hath
proved
an
apostate
to
his
vows
your
candour
will
not
suffer
you
to
condemn
the
whole
sex
some
there
are
whose
bosoms
glow
with
passion
equally
pure
unalterable
and
intense
for
my
own
part
i
have
sacrificed
to
a
rigid
punctilio
of
honour
the
dearest
ideas
of
my
heart
i
beheld
your
unrivalled
charms
and
deeply
felt
their
power
yet
while
a
possibility
of
melvil
reformation
remained
and
while
i
was
restrained
by
my
niggard
fortune
from
making
a
tender
worthy
of
your
acceptance
i
combated
with
my
inclinations
and
bore
without
repining
the
pangs
of
hopeless
love
but
now
that
my
honour
is
disengaged
and
my
fortune
rendered
independent
by
the
last
will
of
a
worthy
nobleman
whose
friendship
i
was
favoured
with
in
france
i
presume
to
lay
myself
at
the
feet
of
the
adorable
monimia
as
the
most
faithful
of
admirers
whose
happiness
or
misery
wholly
depends
upon
her
nod
believe
me
madam
these
are
not
the
professions
of
idle
gallantry
i
speak
the
genuine
though
imperfect
language
of
my
heart
words
even
the
most
pathetic
can
not
do
justice
to
my
love
i
gaze
upon
your
beauty
with
ravishment
but
i
contemplate
the
graces
of
your
soul
with
such
awful
veneration
that
i
tremble
while
i
approach
you
as
if
my
vows
were
addressed
to
some
superior
during
this
declaration
which
was
pronounced
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
monimia
was
successively
agitated
with
shame
anger
and
grief
nevertheless
she
summoned
her
whole
philosophy
to
her
aid
and
with
a
tranquil
though
determined
air
begged
he
would
not
diminish
the
obligations
he
had
already
conferred
by
disturbing
with
such
unseasonable
addresses
a
poor
unhappy
maid
who
had
detached
all
her
thoughts
from
earthly
objects
and
waited
impatiently
for
that
dissolution
which
alone
could
put
a
period
to
her
misfortunes
fathom
imagining
that
these
were
no
other
than
the
suggestions
of
a
temporary
disappointment
and
despondence
which
it
was
his
business
to
oppose
with
all
his
eloquence
and
art
renewed
his
theme
with
redoubled
ardour
and
at
last
became
so
importunate
in
his
desires
that
monimia
provoked
beyond
the
power
of
concealing
her
resentment
said
she
was
heartily
sorry
to
find
herself
under
the
necessity
of
telling
him
that
in
the
midst
of
her
misfortunes
she
could
not
help
remembering
what
she
had
been
then
rising
from
her
seat
with
all
the
dignity
of
displeasure
perhaps
added
she
you
have
forgot
who
was
the
father
of
the
once
happy
with
these
words
she
retired
into
another
chamber
leaving
our
adventurer
confounded
by
the
repulse
he
had
sustained
not
that
he
was
discouraged
from
prosecuting
his
aim
on
the
contrary
this
rebuff
seemed
to
add
fresh
vigour
to
his
operations
he
now
thought
it
high
time
to
bring
over
madam
la
mer
to
his
interest
and
to
facilitate
her
conversion
took
an
opportunity
of
bribing
her
with
some
inconsiderable
presents
after
having
amused
her
with
a
plausible
tale
of
his
passion
for
monimia
with
whom
she
undertook
the
office
of
his
mediatrix
on
the
supposition
that
his
intentions
were
honourable
and
highly
advantageous
to
her
lodger
she
was
first
of
all
invested
with
the
office
of
obtaining
pardon
for
the
offence
he
had
given
and
in
this
negotiation
she
succeeded
so
well
as
to
become
an
advocate
for
his
suit
accordingly
she
took
all
occasions
of
magnifying
his
praise
his
agreeable
person
was
often
the
subject
of
her
discourse
to
the
fair
mourner
her
admiration
dwelt
upon
his
politeness
good
sense
and
winning
deportment
and
she
every
day
retailed
little
stories
of
his
benevolence
and
greatness
of
soul
the
defect
in
his
birth
she
represented
as
a
circumstance
altogether
foreign
from
the
consideration
of
his
merit
especially
in
a
nation
where
such
distinctions
are
as
little
respected
as
they
will
be
in
a
future
state
she
mentioned
several
persons
of
note
who
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
power
and
fortune
without
having
enjoyed
the
least
hereditary
assistance
from
their
forefathers
one
she
said
sprung
from
the
loins
of
an
obscure
attorney
another
was
the
grandson
of
a
a
third
was
the
issue
of
an
accountant
and
a
fourth
the
offspring
of
a
woollen
draper
all
these
were
the
children
of
their
own
good
works
and
had
raised
themselves
upon
their
personal
virtues
and
address
a
foundation
certainly
more
solid
and
honourable
than
a
vague
inheritance
derived
from
ancestors
in
whose
deserts
they
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
borne
the
least
share
monimia
listened
to
all
these
arguments
with
great
patience
and
affability
though
she
at
once
dived
into
the
source
from
which
all
such
insinuations
flowed
she
joined
in
the
commendations
of
fathom
and
owned
herself
a
particular
instance
of
that
benevolence
which
the
old
lady
had
so
justly
extolled
but
once
for
all
to
prevent
the
supplication
which
madam
la
mer
was
about
to
make
she
solemnly
protested
that
her
heart
was
altogether
shut
against
any
other
earthly
engagement
and
that
her
thoughts
were
altogether
employed
upon
her
eternal
salvation
the
assiduous
landlady
perceiving
the
steadiness
of
her
disposition
thought
proper
to
alter
her
method
of
proceeding
and
for
the
present
suspended
that
theme
by
which
she
found
her
fair
lodger
disobliged
resolved
to
reconcile
monimia
to
life
before
she
would
again
recommend
ferdinand
to
her
love
she
endeavoured
to
amuse
her
imagination
by
recounting
the
occasional
incidents
of
the
day
hoping
gradually
to
decoy
her
attention
to
those
sublunary
objects
from
which
it
had
been
industriously
weaned
she
seasoned
her
conversation
with
agreeable
sallies
enlarged
upon
the
different
scenes
of
pleasure
and
diversion
appertaining
to
this
great
metropolis
practised
upon
her
palate
with
the
delicacies
of
eating
endeavoured
to
shake
her
temperance
with
repeated
proffers
and
recommendations
of
certain
cordials
and
restoratives
which
she
alleged
were
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
and
pressed
her
to
make
little
excursions
into
the
fields
that
skirt
the
town
for
the
benefit
of
air
and
exercise
while
this
auxiliary
plied
the
disconsolate
monimia
on
one
hand
fathom
was
not
remiss
on
the
other
he
now
seemed
to
have
sacrificed
his
passion
to
her
quiet
his
discourse
turned
upon
more
indifferent
subjects
he
endeavoured
to
dispel
her
melancholy
with
arguments
drawn
from
philosophy
and
religion
on
some
occasions
he
displayed
all
his
fund
of
good
humour
with
a
view
to
beguile
her
sorrow
he
importuned
her
to
give
him
the
pleasure
of
squiring
her
to
some
place
of
innocent
entertainment
and
finally
insisted
upon
her
accepting
a
pecuniary
reinforcement
to
her
finances
which
he
knew
to
be
in
a
most
consumptive
condition
chapter
monimia
honour
is
protected
by
the
interposition
of
heaven
with
that
complacency
and
fortitude
which
were
peculiar
to
herself
this
hapless
stranger
resisted
all
those
artful
temptations
her
sustenance
was
barely
such
as
exempted
her
from
the
guilt
of
being
accessory
to
her
own
death
her
drink
was
the
simple
element
she
encouraged
no
discourse
but
that
which
turned
upon
the
concerns
of
her
immortal
part
she
never
went
abroad
except
in
visits
to
a
french
chapel
in
the
neighbourhood
she
refused
the
proffered
assistance
of
our
adventurer
with
equal
obstinacy
and
politeness
and
with
pleasure
saw
herself
wasting
towards
that
period
of
mortality
which
was
the
consummation
of
her
wish
yet
her
charms
far
from
melting
away
with
her
constitution
seemed
to
triumph
over
the
decays
of
nature
her
shape
and
features
still
retained
that
harmony
for
which
they
had
always
been
distinguished
a
mixture
of
majesty
and
sweetness
diffused
itself
in
her
looks
and
her
feebleness
added
to
that
soft
and
feminine
grace
which
attracts
the
sympathy
and
engages
the
protection
of
every
humane
beholder
the
associates
thus
baffled
in
their
attempts
to
excite
her
ideas
of
pleasure
again
shifted
their
plan
and
resolved
to
attack
this
forlorn
beauty
on
the
side
of
fear
and
mortification
our
adventurer
became
less
frequent
in
his
visits
and
more
indifferent
in
his
language
and
deportment
while
madam
la
mer
gradually
relaxed
in
that
complacency
and
respect
with
which
she
had
hitherto
behaved
towards
her
fair
lodger
she
even
began
to
drop
hints
of
disapprobation
and
reproach
against
this
pattern
of
innocence
and
beauty
and
at
length
grew
bold
enough
to
tell
her
that
her
misfortunes
could
be
attributed
to
nothing
but
her
own
obstinacy
and
pride
that
she
had
been
at
great
pains
to
disoblige
the
only
person
who
was
able
and
willing
to
raise
her
above
dependence
and
that
if
his
protection
should
be
withdrawn
she
must
be
exposed
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
distress
these
insinuations
instead
of
producing
the
desired
effect
inflamed
the
indignation
of
monimia
who
in
a
most
dignified
style
of
rebuke
chid
her
for
her
indelicacy
and
presumption
observing
that
she
could
have
no
title
to
take
such
freedoms
with
lodgers
whose
punctuality
and
regular
deportment
left
her
no
room
to
complain
notwithstanding
this
animated
reply
she
underwent
the
most
deplorable
anguish
when
she
reflected
upon
the
insolence
of
this
woman
from
whose
barbarity
she
had
no
resource
and
seeing
no
other
possibility
of
redress
than
that
of
appealing
to
the
good
offices
of
fathom
she
conquered
her
reluctance
so
far
as
to
complain
to
him
of
madam
la
mer
incivility
pleased
with
this
application
he
gave
her
to
understand
with
very
little
ceremony
or
preamble
that
it
wholly
depended
upon
herself
whether
she
should
continue
to
be
wretched
or
be
delivered
at
once
from
all
her
cares
and
perplexity
that
notwithstanding
the
disdain
with
which
she
had
treated
his
addresses
he
was
still
ready
to
lay
himself
and
his
fortune
at
her
feet
and
that
if
she
should
again
reject
the
disinterested
proposal
the
whole
world
and
her
own
conscience
would
charge
upon
herself
whatever
calamities
she
might
be
subjected
to
in
the
sequel
interpreting
into
a
favourable
hesitation
her
silence
which
was
the
result
of
wrath
and
amazement
he
proceeded
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
utter
a
romantic
rhapsody
in
the
course
of
which
laying
aside
all
that
restraint
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
he
seized
her
delicate
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
nay
so
far
did
he
forget
himself
on
this
occasion
that
he
caught
the
fair
creature
in
his
arms
and
rudely
ravished
a
kiss
from
those
lips
which
he
had
before
contemplated
with
the
most
distant
reverence
of
desire
having
thus
broken
down
the
fences
of
decorum
and
being
heated
with
transport
he
in
all
probability
would
have
acted
the
part
of
young
tarquin
and
violated
by
force
that
sacred
shrine
of
honour
beauty
and
unblemished
truth
had
not
the
wrath
kindled
by
such
an
unexpected
outrage
inspired
her
with
strength
and
spirits
sufficient
to
protect
her
virtue
and
intimidate
the
ruffian
who
could
offer
violence
to
such
perfection
she
broke
from
his
detested
embrace
with
surprising
agility
and
called
aloud
to
her
landlady
for
assistance
but
that
discreet
matron
was
resolved
to
hear
nothing
and
fathom
appetite
being
whetted
to
a
most
brutal
degree
of
eagerness
madam
said
he
all
opposition
is
vain
what
you
have
refused
to
my
entreaties
you
shall
yield
to
my
power
and
i
am
determined
to
force
you
to
your
own
so
saying
he
sprung
towards
her
with
the
most
savage
and
impious
intent
when
this
amiable
heroine
snatching
up
his
sword
which
lay
upon
a
and
unsheathing
it
instantaneously
presented
the
point
to
his
breast
and
while
her
eyes
glanced
with
intolerable
keenness
villain
cried
she
the
spirit
of
my
father
animates
my
bosom
and
the
vengeance
of
heaven
shall
not
be
he
was
not
so
much
affected
by
his
bodily
danger
as
awestruck
at
the
manner
of
her
address
and
the
appearance
of
her
aspect
which
seemed
to
shine
with
something
supernatural
and
actually
disordered
his
whole
faculties
insomuch
that
he
retreated
without
attempting
to
make
the
least
reply
and
she
having
secured
the
door
after
his
departure
sat
down
to
ponder
upon
this
shocking
event
words
are
wanting
to
describe
the
accumulated
horrors
that
took
possession
of
her
mind
when
she
thus
beheld
all
her
presaging
fears
realised
and
found
herself
at
the
mercy
of
two
wretches
who
had
now
pulled
off
the
mask
after
having
lost
all
sentiments
of
humanity
common
affliction
was
an
agreeable
reverie
to
what
she
suffered
deprived
of
her
parents
exiled
from
her
friends
and
country
reduced
to
the
brink
of
wanting
the
most
indispensable
necessaries
of
life
in
a
foreign
land
where
she
knew
not
one
person
to
whose
protection
she
could
have
recourse
from
the
inexpressible
woes
that
environed
her
she
complained
to
heaven
that
her
life
was
protracted
for
the
augmentation
of
that
misery
which
was
already
too
severe
to
be
endured
for
she
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
being
utterly
abandoned
in
the
last
stage
of
mortality
without
one
friend
to
close
her
eyes
or
do
the
last
offices
of
humanity
to
her
breathless
corse
these
were
dreadful
reflections
to
a
young
lady
who
had
been
born
to
affluence
and
splendour
trained
up
in
all
the
elegance
of
education
by
nature
fraught
with
that
sensibility
which
refines
the
sentiment
and
taste
and
so
tenderly
cherished
by
her
indulgent
parents
that
they
suffered
not
the
winds
of
heaven
to
visit
her
face
too
roughly
having
passed
the
night
in
such
agony
she
rose
at
daybreak
and
hearing
the
chapel
bell
toll
for
morning
prayers
resolved
to
go
to
this
place
of
worship
in
order
to
implore
the
assistance
of
heaven
she
no
sooner
opened
her
chamber
door
with
this
intent
than
she
was
met
by
madam
la
mer
who
after
having
professed
her
concern
for
what
had
happened
overnight
and
imputed
fathom
rudeness
to
the
spirit
of
intoxication
by
which
she
had
never
before
seen
him
possessed
she
endeavoured
to
dissuade
monimia
from
her
purpose
by
observing
that
her
health
would
be
prejudiced
by
the
cold
morning
air
but
finding
her
determined
she
insisted
upon
accompanying
her
to
chapel
on
pretence
of
respect
though
in
reality
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
escape
of
her
beauteous
lodger
thus
attended
the
hapless
mourner
entered
the
place
and
according
to
the
laudable
hospitality
of
england
which
is
the
only
country
in
christendom
where
a
stranger
is
not
made
welcome
to
the
house
of
god
this
amiable
creature
emaciated
and
enfeebled
as
she
was
must
have
stood
in
a
common
passage
during
the
whole
service
had
not
she
been
perceived
by
a
humane
gentlewoman
who
struck
with
her
beauty
and
dignified
air
and
melted
with
sympathy
at
the
ineffable
sorrow
which
was
visible
in
her
countenance
opened
the
pew
in
which
she
sat
and
accommodated
monimia
and
her
attendant
if
she
was
captivated
by
her
first
appearance
she
was
not
less
affected
by
the
deportment
of
her
fair
guest
which
was
the
pattern
of
genuine
devotion
in
a
word
this
good
lady
who
was
a
merchant
widow
in
opulent
circumstances
was
inflamed
with
a
longing
desire
to
know
and
befriend
the
amiable
stranger
who
after
service
turning
about
to
thank
her
for
her
civility
madam
clement
with
that
frankness
which
is
the
result
of
true
benevolence
told
her
she
was
too
much
prepossessed
in
her
favour
to
let
slip
this
opportunity
of
craving
her
acquaintance
and
of
expressing
her
inclination
to
alleviate
if
possible
that
affliction
which
was
manifest
in
her
looks
monimia
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
and
surprise
at
this
unexpected
address
gazed
upon
the
lady
in
silence
and
when
she
repeated
her
tenders
of
service
could
make
no
other
reply
to
her
goodness
than
by
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
this
was
a
species
of
eloquence
which
did
not
pass
unregarded
by
madam
clement
who
while
her
own
eyes
were
bedewed
with
the
drops
of
sympathy
and
compassion
took
the
lovely
orphan
by
the
hand
and
led
her
without
further
ceremony
to
her
own
coach
that
stood
waiting
at
the
door
whither
they
were
followed
by
la
mer
who
was
so
much
confounded
at
the
adventure
that
she
made
no
objections
to
the
proposal
of
the
lady
who
handed
her
lodger
into
the
carriage
but
retired
with
all
possible
despatch
to
make
fathom
acquainted
with
this
unforeseen
event
meanwhile
the
agitation
of
monimia
at
this
providential
deliverance
was
such
as
had
destroyed
her
tender
frame
the
blood
flushed
and
forsook
her
cheeks
by
turns
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
notwithstanding
the
consolatory
assurances
of
madam
clement
and
without
being
able
to
utter
one
word
was
conducted
to
the
house
of
that
kind
benefactress
where
the
violence
of
her
transports
overpowered
her
constitution
and
she
sunk
down
upon
a
couch
in
a
swoon
from
which
she
was
not
easily
recovered
this
affecting
circumstance
augmented
the
pity
and
interested
the
curiosity
of
madam
clement
who
concluded
there
was
something
very
extraordinary
in
the
case
of
the
stranger
to
produce
these
agonies
and
grew
impatient
to
hear
the
particulars
of
her
story
monimia
no
sooner
retrieved
the
use
of
her
faculties
than
looking
around
and
observing
with
what
humane
concern
her
new
hostess
was
employed
in
effecting
her
recovery
is
this
said
she
a
flattering
illusion
of
the
brain
or
am
i
really
under
the
protection
of
some
beneficent
being
whom
heaven
hath
inspired
with
generosity
to
rescue
an
hapless
stranger
from
the
most
forlorn
state
of
misery
and
woe
her
voice
was
at
all
times
ravishingly
sweet
and
this
exclamation
was
pronounced
with
such
pathetic
fervour
that
madam
clement
clasped
her
in
her
arms
and
kissing
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
yes
cried
she
fair
creature
heaven
hath
bestowed
upon
me
an
heart
to
compassionate
and
power
i
hope
to
lighten
the
burden
of
your
she
then
prevailed
upon
her
to
take
some
nourishment
and
afterwards
to
recount
the
particulars
of
her
fate
a
task
she
performed
with
such
accuracy
and
candour
that
madam
clement
far
from
suspecting
her
sincerity
saw
truth
and
conviction
in
every
circumstance
of
her
tale
and
having
condoled
her
misfortunes
entreated
her
to
forget
them
or
at
least
look
upon
herself
as
one
sheltered
under
the
care
and
tuition
of
a
person
whose
study
it
would
be
to
supply
her
want
of
natural
parents
this
would
have
been
an
happy
vicissitude
of
fortune
had
it
not
arrived
too
late
but
such
a
sudden
and
transition
not
only
disordered
the
faculties
of
poor
monimia
mind
but
also
overpowered
the
organs
of
her
body
already
fatigued
and
enfeebled
by
the
distresses
she
had
undergone
so
that
she
was
taken
ill
of
a
fever
that
same
night
and
became
delirious
before
morning
when
a
physician
was
called
to
her
assistance
while
this
gentleman
was
in
the
house
madam
clement
was
visited
by
fathom
who
after
having
complained
in
the
most
insinuating
manner
that
she
had
encouraged
his
wife
to
abandon
her
duty
told
her
a
plausible
story
of
his
first
acquaintance
with
monimia
and
his
marriage
at
the
fleet
which
he
said
he
was
ready
to
prove
by
the
evidence
of
the
clergyman
who
joined
them
and
that
of
la
mer
who
was
present
at
the
ceremony
the
good
lady
although
a
little
staggered
at
the
genteel
appearance
and
engaging
address
of
this
stranger
could
not
prevail
upon
herself
to
believe
that
she
had
been
imposed
upon
by
her
fair
lodger
who
by
this
time
had
given
too
convincing
a
proof
of
her
sincerity
nevertheless
in
order
to
prevent
any
dispute
that
might
be
prejudicial
to
the
health
or
recovery
of
monimia
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
would
not
at
present
enter
upon
the
merits
of
the
cause
but
only
assure
him
that
the
young
lady
was
actually
bereft
of
her
senses
and
in
imminent
danger
of
her
life
for
the
truth
of
which
assertions
she
would
appeal
to
his
own
observation
and
the
opinion
of
the
physician
who
was
then
employed
in
writing
a
prescription
for
the
cure
of
her
disease
so
saying
she
conducted
him
into
the
chamber
where
he
beheld
the
hapless
virgin
stretched
upon
a
panting
under
the
violence
of
a
distemper
too
mighty
for
her
weakly
frame
her
hair
dishevelled
and
discomposure
in
her
looks
all
the
roses
of
her
youth
were
faded
yet
all
the
graces
of
her
beauty
were
not
fled
she
retained
that
sweetness
and
symmetry
which
death
itself
could
not
destroy
and
though
her
discourse
was
incoherent
her
voice
was
still
musical
resembling
those
feathered
songsters
who
warble
their
native
wild
fathom
as
upon
all
other
occasions
so
on
this
did
behave
like
an
inimitable
actor
he
ran
to
the
bedside
with
all
the
trepidation
of
a
distracted
lover
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
while
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
imprinted
a
thousand
kisses
on
the
soft
hand
of
monimia
who
regarding
him
with
a
and
undistinguishing
eye
alas
renaldo
said
she
we
were
born
to
be
would
to
heaven
cried
ferdinand
in
a
transport
of
grief
the
wretch
renaldo
had
never
been
born
that
is
the
villain
who
seduced
the
affection
of
this
unfortunate
woman
i
admitted
the
traitor
into
my
friendship
and
confidence
relieved
him
in
his
necessities
and
like
the
ungrateful
viper
he
hath
stung
the
very
bosom
that
cherished
him
in
his
then
he
proceeded
to
inform
madam
clement
how
he
had
delivered
that
same
renaldo
from
prison
maintained
him
afterwards
at
a
great
expense
and
at
length
furnished
him
with
a
sum
of
money
and
proper
credentials
to
support
his
interest
at
the
court
of
vienna
having
finished
this
detail
he
asked
the
physician
sentiments
of
his
wife
distemper
and
being
told
that
her
life
was
in
extreme
jeopardy
begged
he
would
use
his
utmost
endeavours
in
her
behalf
and
even
made
him
a
tender
of
an
extraordinary
fee
which
was
refused
he
also
thanked
madam
clement
for
her
charity
and
benevolence
towards
a
stranger
and
took
his
leave
with
many
polite
professions
of
gratitude
and
esteem
he
had
no
sooner
quitted
the
house
than
the
physician
who
was
a
humane
man
and
a
foreigner
began
to
caution
the
lady
against
his
insinuations
observing
that
some
circumstances
of
the
story
concerning
renaldo
were
to
his
particular
knowledge
contrary
to
truth
for
that
he
himself
had
been
applied
to
for
letters
of
recommendation
in
behalf
of
count
melvil
by
a
jew
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
supplied
the
young
gentleman
with
money
sufficient
for
his
occasions
in
consequence
of
a
minute
inquiry
he
had
made
into
the
character
of
renaldo
who
was
by
all
reports
a
youth
of
strict
honour
and
untainted
morals
madam
clement
thus
cautioned
entered
into
deliberation
with
her
own
thoughts
and
comparing
the
particulars
of
this
account
with
those
of
monimia
own
story
she
concluded
that
fathom
was
the
very
traitor
he
himself
had
described
and
that
he
had
by
abusing
the
confidence
of
both
effected
a
fatal
breach
between
two
innocent
and
deserving
lovers
she
accordingly
looked
upon
him
with
horror
and
detestation
but
nevertheless
resolved
to
treat
him
with
civility
in
the
meantime
that
the
poor
young
lady
might
not
be
disturbed
in
her
last
moments
for
she
had
now
lost
all
hopes
of
her
recovery
yet
the
fever
abated
and
in
two
days
she
retrieved
the
use
of
her
reason
though
the
distemper
had
affected
her
lungs
and
she
was
in
all
appearance
doomed
to
linger
a
few
weeks
longer
in
a
consumption
fathom
was
punctual
in
his
visitation
though
never
admitted
into
her
presence
after
the
delirium
vanished
and
he
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
conveyed
in
a
chariot
to
kensington
gravel
pits
a
place
which
may
be
termed
the
last
stage
of
many
a
mortal
peregrination
he
now
implicitly
believed
that
death
would
in
a
few
days
baffle
all
his
designs
upon
the
unfortunate
monimia
and
foreseeing
that
as
he
had
owned
himself
her
husband
he
might
be
obliged
to
defray
the
expenses
incurred
by
her
sickness
and
burial
he
very
prudently
intermitted
in
his
visits
and
had
recourse
to
the
intelligence
of
his
auxiliary
as
for
monimia
she
approached
the
goal
of
life
not
simply
with
resignation
but
with
rapture
she
enjoyed
in
tranquillity
the
conversation
of
her
kind
benefactress
who
never
stirred
from
her
apartment
she
was
blessed
with
the
spiritual
consolation
of
a
worthy
clergyman
who
removed
all
her
religious
scruples
and
she
congratulated
herself
on
the
near
prospect
of
that
land
of
peace
where
sorrow
is
not
known
at
length
la
mer
gave
notice
to
our
adventurer
of
this
amiable
young
lady
decease
and
the
time
fixed
for
the
interment
upon
which
these
two
virtuous
associates
took
possession
of
a
place
from
whence
they
could
unperceived
behold
the
funeral
he
must
have
a
hard
heart
who
without
an
emotion
of
pity
can
see
the
last
offices
performed
to
a
young
creature
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
even
though
he
knows
not
her
name
and
is
an
utter
stranger
to
her
virtues
how
callous
then
must
the
soul
of
that
wretch
have
been
who
without
a
symptom
of
remorse
or
concern
saw
the
sable
hearse
adorned
with
white
plumes
as
emblems
of
monimia
purity
pass
before
him
while
her
incomparable
merit
stood
full
in
his
remembrance
and
he
knew
himself
the
wicked
cause
of
her
untimely
fate
perfidious
wretch
thy
crimes
turn
out
so
atrocious
that
i
half
repent
me
of
having
undertaken
to
record
thy
memoirs
yet
such

to
be
exhibited
to
public
view
that
mankind
may
be
upon
their
guard
against
imposture
that
the

may
see
how
fraud
is
apt
to
overshoot
itself
and
that
as
virtue
though
it
may
suffer
for
a
while
will
triumph
in
the
end
so
iniquity
though
it
may
prosper
for
a

at

be
overtaken
by
that
punishment
and
disgrace

the
scene
and

in
a
new
character
fathom
expectations
with
respect
to
the
fair
orphan
having
thus
proved
abortive
he
lost
no
time
in
bewailing
his
miscarriage
but
had
immediate
recourse
to
other
means
of
improving
his
small
fortune
which
at
this
period
amounted
to
near
two
hundred
pounds
whatever
inclination
he
had
to
resume
the
character
he
had
formerly
borne
in
the
polite
world
he
durst
not
venture
to
launch
out
again
into
the
expense
necessary
to
maintain
that
station
because
his
former
resources
were
now
stopped
and
all
the
people
of
fashion
by
this
time
convinced
of
his
being
a
needy
adventurer
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
sound
the
sentiments
of
his
old
friends
at
a
distance
and
judge
from
the
reception
he
should
meet
with
how
far
he
might
presume
upon
their
countenance
and
favour
for
he
rightly
supposed
that
if
he
could
in
any
shape
contribute
to
their
interest
or
amusement
they
would
easily
forgive
his
former
pretensions
to
quality
arrogant
as
they
were
and
still
entertain
him
on
the
footing
of
a
necessary
acquaintance
with
this
view
he
one
day
presented
himself
at
court
in
a
very
gay
suit
of
clothes
and
bowed
at
a
distance
to
many
of
his
old
fashionable
friends
of
both
sexes
not
one
of
whom
favoured
him
with
any
other
notice
than
that
of
a
quarter
curtsey
or
slight
inclination
of
the
head
for
by
this
time
the
few
that
remembered
him
knew
from
what
retirement
he
now
emerged
and
avoided
him
accordingly
as
the
jail
infection
but
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
cultivated
him
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortune
were
now
utter
strangers
to
his
person
which
they
had
actually
forgot
amidst
the
succession
of
novelties
that
surrounded
them
or
if
they
did
recollect
his
name
it
was
remembered
as
an
old
fashion
which
had
been
many
months
out
of
date
notwithstanding
these
mortifying
discouragements
our
hero

same
evening
effected
a
lodgment
in
a
certain
not
far
from
james
and
as
he
played
pretty
high
and
made
a
parade
of
his
ready
money
he
was
soon
recognised
by
divers
persons
of
consequence
who
cordially
welcomed
him
to
england
on
pretence
of
believing
he
had
been
abroad
and
with
great
complacency
repeated
their
former
professions
of
friendship
though
this
was
a
certain
way
of
retaining
the
favour
of
those
worthies
while
his
finances
continued
to
flourish
and
his
payments
were
prompt
he
knew
the
weakness
of
his
funds
too
well
to
think
they
could
bear
the
vicissitudes
of
play
and
the
remembrance
of
the
two
british
knights
who
had
spoiled
him
at
paris
hung
over
his
imagination
with
the
most
frightful
presages
besides
he
perceived
that
gaming
was
now
managed
in
such
a
manner
as
rendered
skill
and
dexterity
of
no
advantage
for
the
spirit
of
play
having
overspread
the
land
like
a
pestilence
raged
to
such
a
degree
of
madness
and
desperation
that
the
unhappy
people
who
were
infected
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
amusement
economy
or
caution
and
risked
their
fortunes
upon
issues
equally
extravagant
childish
and
absurd
the
whole
mystery
of
the
art
was
reduced
to
the
simple
exercise
of
tossing
up
a
guinea
and
the
lust
of
laying
wagers
which
they
indulged
to
a
surprising
pitch
of
ridiculous
intemperance
in
one
corner
of
the
room
might
be
heard
a
pair
of
lordlings
running
their
grandmothers
against
each
other
that
is
betting
sums
on
the
longest
liver
in
another
the
success
of
the
wager
depended
upon
the
sex
of
the
next
child
and
one
of
the
waiters
happening
to
drop
down
in
an
apoplectic
fit
a
certain
noble
peer
exclaimed
dead
for
a
thousand
the
challenge
was
immediately
accepted
and
when
the
master
of
the
house
sent
for
a
surgeon
to
attempt
the
cure
the
nobleman
who
set
the
price
upon
the
patient
head
insisted
upon
his
being
left
to
the
efforts
of
nature
alone
otherwise
the
wager
should
be
void
nay
when
the
landlord
harped
upon
the
loss
he
should
sustain
by
the
death
of
a
trusty
servant
his
lordship
obviated
the
objection
by
desiring
that
the
fellow
might
be
charged
in
the
bill
in
short
the
rage
of
gaming
seemed
to
have
devoured
all
their
other
faculties
and
to
have
equalled
the
rash
enthusiasm
of
the
inhabitants
of
malacca
in
the
east
indies
who
are
so
possessed
with
that
pernicious
spirit
that
they
sacrifice
to
it
not
only
their
fortunes
but
also
their
wives
and
children
and
then
letting
their
hair
down
upon
their
shoulders
in
imitation
of
the
ancient
lacedaemonians
when
they
devoted
themselves
to
death
those
wretches
unsheathe
their
daggers
and
murder
every
living
creature
in
their
way
in
this
however
they
differ
from
the
gamesters
of
our
country
who
never
find
their
senses
until
they
have
lost
their
fortunes
and
beggared
their
families
whereas
the
malays
never
run
amuck
but
in
consequence
of
misery
and
despair
such
are
the
amusements
or
rather
such
is
the
continual
employment
of
those
hopeful
youths
who
are
destined
by
birth
to
be
the
judges
of
our
property
and
pillars
of
our
constitution
such
are
the
heirs
and
representatives
of
those
patriots
who
planned
and
those
heroes
who
maintained
the
laws
and
freedom
of
their
country
who
were
the
patrons
of
merit
the
fathers
of
the
poor
the
terror
of
vice
and
immorality
and
at
once
the
ornaments
and
support
of
a
happy
nation
our
adventurer
considered
all
these
circumstances
with
his
wonted
sagacity
and
seeing
upon
what
precarious
footing
he
must
stand
should
he
rank
himself
with
such
society
he
wisely
came
to
the
resolution
of
descending
one
step
in
the
degrees
of
life
and
of
taking
upon
him
the
title
of
physician
under
which
he
did
not
despair
of
insinuating
himself
into
the
pockets
of
his
patients
and
into
the
secrets
of
private
families
so
as
to
acquire
a
comfortable
share
of
practice
or
captivate
the
heart
of
some
heiress
or
rich
widow
whose
fortune
would
at
once
render
him
independent
and
happy
after
this
determination
his
next
care
was
to
concert
measures
for
his
first
appearance
in
this
new
character
well
knowing
that
the
success
of
a
physician
in
a
great
measure
depends
upon
the
external
equipage
in
which
he
first
declares
himself
an
adept
in
the
healing
art
he
first
of
all
procured
a
few
books
on
the
subject
of
medicine
which
he
studied
with
great
attention
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
winter
and
spring
and
repaired
to
tunbridge
with
the
first
of
the
season
where
he
appeared
in
the
uniform
of
aesculapius
namely
a
plain
suit
full
trimmed
with
a
voluminous
believing
that
in
this
place
he
might
glide
as
it
were
imperceptibly
into
the
functions
of
his
new
employment
and
gradually
accustom
himself
to
the
method
and
form
of
prescription
a
man
so
well
known
in
the
gay
world
could
not
be
supposed
to
effect
such
a
transformation
without
being
observed
and
therefore
in
order
to
anticipate
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
those
who
might
be
tempted
to
make
themselves
merry
at
his
expense
he
on
his
arrival
at
the
wells
repaired
to
the
shop
of
an
apothecary
and
calling
for
pen
ink
and
paper
wrote
a
prescription
which
he
desired
might
be
immediately
made
up
while
this
was
doing
by
the
servant
he
was
invited
into
a
parlour
by
the
master
with
whom
he
entered
into
conversation
touching
the
properties
of
the
tunbridge
water
which
seemed
to
have
been
his
particular
study
and
indeed
he
had
perused
rouzee
treatise
on
that
subject
with
indefatigable
assiduity
from
this
theme
he
made
digressions
into
other
parts
of
medicine
upon
which
he
spoke
with
such
plausible
elocution
that
the
apothecary
whose
knowledge
in
that
art
was
not
very
profound
looked
upon
him
as
a
physician
of
great
learning
and
experience
and
hinted
a
desire
of
knowing
his
name
and
situation
fathom
accordingly
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
studied
physic
and
taken
his
degrees
at
padua
rather
for
his
amusement
than
with
any
view
of
exercising
medicine
as
he
then
could
not
possibly
foresee
the
misfortunes
which
had
since
happened
to
his
family
and
by
which
he
was
now
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
a
profession
that
was
very
much
beneath
the
expectations
of
his
birth
yet
he
bore
his
disappointments
with
resignation
and
even
and
blessed
his
stars
for
having
inclined
him
to
the
study
of
any
branch
of
knowledge
by
which
he
might
be
enabled
to
laugh
at
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
he
then
observed
that
he
had
practised
with
some
applause
at
the
hot
well
near
bristol
before
he
thought
he
should
be
ever
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
taking
a
fee
and
that
in
all
probability
his
metamorphosis
when
known
would
furnish
matter
of
surprise
and
merriment
to
some
of
his
old
acquaintance
the
apothecary
was
equally
struck
with
his
polite
address
and
pleased
with
his
agreeable
discourse
he
consoled
him
for
the
misfortunes
of
his
family
by
assuring
him
that
in
england
nothing
could
be
more
honourable
or
indeed
profitable
than
the
character
of
a
physician
provided
he
could
once
wriggle
himself
into
practice
and
insinuated
that
although
he
was
restricted
by
certain
engagements
with
other
persons
of
the
faculty
he
should
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
show
his
regard
for
doctor
fathom
this
was
a
very
effectual
method
which
our
hero
took
to
intimate
his
new
character
to
the
public
by
the
industry
and
communicative
disposition
of
the
apothecary
it
was
circulated
in
half
a
day
through
every
family
in
the
place
and
next
morning
when
ferdinand
appeared
the
company
forthwith
assembled
in
separate
groups
and
from
each
knot
he
heard
his
name
reverberated
in
a
whisper
having
thus
announced
himself
to
all
whom
it
might
concern
and
allowed
the
ladies
two
days
to
discuss
the
merit
of
his
transfiguration
together
with
the
novelty
of
the
case
he
ventured
to
salute
at
a
distance
a
lady
and
her
daughter
who
had
been
his
patients
at
the
hot
well
and
although
they
honoured
his
bow
with
the
return
of
a
slight
curtsey
they
gave
him
not
the
least
encouragement
to
make
a
nearer
approach
notwithstanding
this
rebuff
he
concluded
that
should
the
health
of
either
come
in
question
they
would
renew
their
application
to
his
skill
and
what
was
refused
by
their
pride
would
be
granted
by
their
apprehension
here
however
he
happened
to
be
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
the
young
lady
being
seized
with
a
violent
headache
and
palpitation
her
mother
desired
the
apothecary
to
recommend
a
physician
and
the
person
with
whom
he
was
contracted
being
at
that
time
absent
he
proposed
doctor
fathom
as
a
man
of
great
ability
and
discretion
but
the
good
lady
rejected
the
proposal
with
disdain
because
she
had
formerly
known
him
in
the
character
of
a
count
though
that
very
character
was
the
chief
reason
that
had
then
induced
her
to
crave
his
advice
such
is
the
caprice
of
the
world
in
general
that
whatever
bears
the
face
of
novelty
captivates
or
rather
bewitches
the
imagination
and
confounds
the
ideas
of
reason
and
common
sense
if
for
example
a
scullion
from
the
clinking
of
pewter
shall
conceive
a
taste
for
the
clinking
of
rhyme
and
make
shift
to
bring
together
twenty
syllables
so
as
that
the
tenth
and
last
shall
have
the
like
ending
the
composition
is
immediately
extolled
as
a
miracle
and
what
appeals
to
the
admiration
is
not
the
wit
the
elegance
or
poetry
of
the
work
but
the
uncultivated
talent
and
humble
station
of
the
author
a
reader
does
not
exclaim
what
a
delicate
sentiment
what
a
beautiful
simile
what
easy
and
musical
versification
but
cries
in
rapture
heavens
what
a
prodigy
a
poet
from
the
scullery
a
muse
in
livery
or
apollo
with
a
trowel
the
public
is
astonished
into
liberality
the
scullion
eats
from
those
trenchers
he
scoured
before
the
footman
is
admitted
into
the
coach
behind
which
he
was
wont
to
stand
and
the
bricklayer
instead
of
plastering
walls
bedaubs
his
illustrious
partner
with
the
mortar
of
his
praise
thus
lifted
into
a
higher
sphere
their
talents
receive
cultivation
they
become
professed
bards
and
though
their
subsequent
works
bear
evident
marks
of
improvement
they
are
neglected
among
the
rest
of
their
brethren
because
that
novelty
which
recommended
them
in
the
beginning
no
longer
remains
so
it
fared
with
our
adventurer
in
his
new
occupation
there
was
something
so
extraordinary
in
a
nobleman
understanding
medicine
and
so
uncommon
in
a
physician
prescribing
gratis
that
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
company
at
bristol
were
engaged
and
they
followed
his
advice
as
the
direction
of
some
supernatural
intelligence
but
now
that
he
professed
himself
one
of
the
faculty
and
might
be
supposed
to
have
refreshed
his
memory
and
reinforced
his
knowledge
for
the
occasion
he
was
as
much
overlooked
as
any
other
physician
unsupported
by
interest
or
cabal
or
at
least
the
notice
he
attracted
was
not
at
all
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
because
it
wholly
regarded
the
decline
of
his
fortune
which
is
a
fund
of
disgrace
these
mortifications
did
not
overcome
the
patience
and
perseverance
of
fathom
who
foresaw
that
the
soothing
hand
of
time
would
cast
a
veil
of
oblivion
over
those
scenes
which
were
remembered
to
his
prejudice
and
that
in
the
meantime
though
he
was
excluded
from
the
private
parties
of
the
fair
sex
in
which
his
main
hope
of
success
was
placed
he
should
be
able
to
insinuate
himself
into
some
degree
of
favour
and
practice
among
the
male
patients
and
some
lucky
cure
properly
displayed
might
be
the
means
of
propagating
his
fame
and
banishing
that
reserve
which
at
present
interfered
with
his
purpose
accordingly
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
means
to
break
that
spell
of
universal
prejudice
that
hedged
him
in
at
the
ordinary
which
he
frequented
his
polite
carriage
facetious
remarks
and
agreeable
stories
soon
conciliated
the
regard
of
his
among
whom
he
sometimes
rallied
his
own
transformation
with
singular
and
success
he
was
even
witty
upon
his
want
of
employment
and
used
to
observe
that
a
physician
without
practice
had
one
comfort
to
which
his
brethren
were
strangers
namely
that
the
seldomer
he
had
occasion
to
prescribe
the
less
he
had
upon
his
conscience
on
account
of
being
accessory
to
the
death
of
his
nothing
so
effectually
blunts
the
shafts
of
ridicule
and
defeats
the
aims
of
slander
as
this
method
of
anticipation
in
spite
of
the
arrows
that
were
levelled
against
his
reputation
from
every
at
tunbridge
he
made
his
party
good
among
almost
all
the
gay
young
gentlemen
that
frequented
the
place
far
from
avoiding
his
company
they
began
to
court
his
conversation
and
he
was
commonly
seen
in
the
walks
surrounded
with
a
group
of
admirers
having
thus
paved
the
way
for
a
total
removal
of
the
invidious
prepossession
that
obstructed
his
views
he
one
night
while
every
person
was
lulled
in
the
arms
of
repose
and
universal
silence
prevailed
tuned
his
violin
and
began
to
play
some
masterly
airs
in
a
tone
so
uncommonly
expressive
and
with
such
ravishing
dexterity
of
execution
that
a
certain
lady
who
lodged
in
the
same
house
being
waked
by
the
music
and
ignorant
of
the
source
from
which
it
flowed
listened
with
rapture
as
to
the
harp
of
an
angel
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
loose
gown
rose
and
opened
her
chamber
door
in
order
to
discover
in
what
apartment
the
musician
resided
she
no
sooner
entered
the
passage
than
she
found
her
already
assembled
on
the
same
occasion
and
there
they
remained
during
the
best
part
of
the
night
transported
by
the
harmony
which
our
hero
produced
doctor
fathom
was
immediately
known
to
be
the
author
of
this
entertainment
and
thus
retrieved
the
benefit
of
that
admiration
which
he
had
forfeited
by
appearing
in
the
shape
of
a
physician
for
as
people
had
formerly
wondered
to
see
a
count
skilled
in
medicine
they
were
now
amazed
to
find
a
physician
such
a
master
in
music
the
good
effects
of
this
stratagem
were
almost
instantaneous
his
performance
became
the
topic
of
discourse
among
all
the
fashionable
company
his
male
friends
complimented
him
from
the
information
of
the
other
sex
and
that
lady
whom
he
had
regaled
instead
of
that
shyness
and
disdain
with
which
she
used
to
receive
his
salutation
at
their
very
next
meeting
in
the
thoroughfare
returned
his
bow
with
marks
of
profound
respect
nay
at
midnight
she
with
the
rest
took
post
in
the
same
place
where
they
had
been
stationed
before
and
by
frequent
tittering
and
repeated
whispers
gave
intimation
to
fathom
that
they
would
be
glad
of
a
second
serenade
but
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
human
passions
to
indulge
this
their
desire
it
was
his
interest
to
inflame
their
impatience
rather
than
to
gratify
their
expectation
and
therefore
he
tantalised
them
for
some
hours
by
tuning
his
violin
and
playing
some
flourishes
which
however
produced
nothing
to
fulfil
their
wishes
at
the
ordinary
he
was
accosted
by
a
gentleman
a
lodger
in
the
same
house
who
assured
him
that
the
ladies
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
he
would
let
them
know
when
he
intended
to
amuse
himself
again
with
his
instrument
that
they
might
not
by
falling
asleep
beforehand
deprive
themselves
of
the
pleasure
of
hearing
his
music
to
this
message
he
replied
with
an
air
of
consequence
and
reserve
that
though
music
was
not
the
art
he
professed
he
should
be
always
complaisant
enough
to
entertain
the
ladies
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
when
their
commands
were
signified
to
him
in
a
manner
suited
to
his
character
but
that
he
would
never
put
himself
on
the
footing
of
an
itinerate
harper
whose
music
is
tolerated
through
the
medium
of
a
board
partition
the
gentleman
having
reported
this
answer
to
his
constituents
they
empowered
him
to
invite
doctor
fathom
to
breakfast
and
he
was
next
morning
introduced
with
the
usual
ceremony
and
treated
with
uncommon
regard
by
all
the
females
of
the
house
assembled
for
his
reception
having
thus
broken
the
ice
of
their
aversion
in
one
part
so
as
that
the
beams
of
his
personal
accomplishments
had
room
to
operate
he
soon
effected
a
general
thaw
in
his
favour
and
found
himself
growing
once
more
into
request
amongst
the
most
amiable
part
of
the
creation
his
company
was
coveted
and
his
taste
consulted
in
their
balls
concerts
and
private
assemblies
and
he
recompensed
the
regard
they
paid
to
him
with
an
incessant
exertion
of
his
agreeable
talents
politeness
and
chapter
triumphs
over
a
medical
rival
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
this
attention
his
medical
capacity
seemed
to
be
quite
forgot
they
respected
his
good
breeding
were
charmed
with
his
voice
and
admired
the
fine
touches
of
his
hand
upon
the
violin
but
in
cultivating
the
fiddler
they
utterly
neglected
the
physician
and
in
vain
did
he
attempt
to
divide
their
regard
by
taking
all
opportunities
to
turn
the
conversation
into
a
more
interesting
channel
it
was
to
little
purpose
he
endeavoured
to
arouse
the
wonder
of
his
audience
with
frequent
descriptions
of
portentous
maladies
and
amazing
cures
he
had
seen
and
performed
in
the
course
of
his
study
and
practice
abroad
and
to
no
effect
did
he
publicly
busy
himself
in
making
experiments
on
the
mineral
water
in
which
he
pretended
to
have
made
several
new
and
important
discoveries
these
efforts
did
not
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
the
minds
of
the
company
because
they
saw
nothing
surprising
in
a
physician
being
acquainted
with
all
the
mysteries
of
his
art
and
as
their
custom
was
already
bespoke
for
others
of
the
profession
whom
it
was
their
interest
to
employ
our
adventurer
might
have
starved
amidst
the
caresses
of
his
acquaintance
had
not
he
derived
considerable
advantage
from
a
lucky
accident
in
the
course
of
his
expectancy
a
gentlewoman
daughter
of
a
weakly
constitution
by
drinking
the
waters
had
so
far
recovered
her
health
and
complexion
as
to
allure
the
affection
of
a
young
squire
in
the
neighbourhood
who
amused
her
for
some
time
with
his
addresses
until
his
heart
was
seduced
by
the
charms
of
another
young
lady
lately
arrived
at
the
wells
the
forsaken
nymph
shocked
at
this
disgrace
and
mortification
relapsed
into
her
former
languishing
disorder
and
was
by
her
mother
put
under
the
management
and
prescription
of
a
physician
who
had
been
an
industrious
enemy
of
fathom
from
his
first
appearance
at
tunbridge
the
patient
though
violently
chagrined
at
the
levity
of
her
quondam
admirer
was
not
altogether
without
hope
that
the
very
same
inconstancy
which
had
prompted
him
to
leave
her
might
in
time
induce
him
to
return
after
the
novelty
of
his
new
passion
should
be
wore
off
and
this
hope
served
to
support
her
under
the
sorrow
and
disgrace
of
her
disappointment
at
length
however
the
squire
and
his
new
mistress
disappeared
and
some
busybody
was
officious
enough
to
communicate
this
piece
of
news
to
the
forlorn
shepherdess
with
this
additional
circumstance
that
they
were
gone
to
a
neighbouring
parish
to
be
joined
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
these
fatal
tidings
were
no
sooner
imparted
to
the
abandoned
phillis
than
she
was
seized
with
an
hysteric
fit
and
what
rendered
the
accident
more
unfortunate
her
physician
had
been
called
to
the
country
and
was
not
expected
at
tunbridge
till
next
day
the
apothecary
was
immediately
summoned
and
being
either
puzzled
by
the
symptoms
or
afraid
of
encroaching
upon
the
province
of
his
superiors
advised
the
old
lady
to
send
for
doctor
fathom
without
delay
she
had
no
other
objection
to
this
expedient
but
the
enmity
which
she
knew
subsisted
between
the
two
leeches
yet
hearing
that
her
own
doctor
would
not
consult
with
fathom
upon
his
return
but
perhaps
renounce
the
patient
by
which
means
her
daughter
health
might
be
endangered
she
would
not
solicit
our
assistance
until
the
young
lady
had
remained
seven
hours
speechless
and
insensible
when
her
fear
prevailing
over
every
other
consideration
she
implored
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
who
having
made
the
necessary
interrogations
and
felt
the
patient
pulse
which
was
regular
and
distinct
found
reason
to
conclude
that
the
fit
would
not
last
much
longer
and
after
having
observed
that
she
was
in
a
very
dangerous
way
prescribed
some
medicines
for
external
application
and
to
enhance
their
opinion
of
his
diligence
and
humanity
resolved
to
stay
in
the
room
and
observe
their
effect
his
judgment
did
not
fail
him
on
this
occasion
in
less
than
half
an
hour
after
his
embrocations
had
been
applied
she
recovered
the
use
of
her
tongue
opened
her
eyes
and
having
in
delirious
exclamations
upbraided
her
perfidious
lover
became
quite
sensible
and
composed
though
she
continued
extremely
low
and
dejected
to
remedy
these
sinkings
certain
cordials
were
immediately
administered
according
to
the
prescription
of
doctor
fathom
upon
whom
extraordinary
encomiums
were
bestowed
by
all
present
who
believed
he
had
actually
rescued
her
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
as
he
was
by
this
time
let
into
the
secrets
of
the
family
he
found
himself
in
a
fair
way
of
being
an
egregious
favourite
of
the
old
gentlewoman
when
unluckily
his
brother
having
dismissed
his
country
patient
with
uncommon
despatch
entered
the
apartment
and
eyed
his
rival
with
looks
of
inexpressible
rage
then
surveying
the
patient
and
the
phials
that
stood
upon
the
table
by
turns
what
in
the
name
of
god
cried
he
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
trash
really
doctor
replied
the
mother
a
little
confounded
at
being
thus
taken
by
surprise
biddy
has
been
taken
dangerously
ill
and
lain
seven
or
eight
hours
in
a
severe
fit
from
which
i
am
confident
she
would
never
have
recovered
without
the
help
of
a
physician
and
as
you
were
absent
we
had
recourse
to
this
gentleman
whose
prescription
hath
had
a
happy
and
surprising
effect
cried
this
offended
member
of
the
faculty
pshaw
stuff
who
made
you
judge
of
effects
or
causes
then
advancing
to
the
patient
what
has
been
the
matter
miss
biddy
that
you
could
not
wait
till
my
return
here
fathom
interposing
sir
said
he
if
you
will
step
into
the
next
room
i
will
communicate
my
sentiments
of
the
case
together
with
the
method
upon
which
i
have
proceeded
that
we
may
deliberate
upon
the
next
step
that
is
to
be
instead
of
complying
with
this
proposal
he
seated
himself
in
a
chair
with
his
back
to
our
adventurer
and
while
he
examined
miss
biddy
pulse
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
should
not
consult
with
him
about
the
matter
fathom
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
at
this
uncivil
answer
walked
round
his
antagonist
and
placing
himself
in
his
front
desired
to
know
his
reason
for
treating
him
with
such
supercilious
contempt
i
am
resolved
said
the
other
never
to
consult
with
any
physician
who
has
not
taken
his
degrees
at
either
of
the
english
upon
the
supposition
replied
our
adventurer
that
no
person
can
be
properly
educated
for
the
profession
at
any
other
you
are
in
the
right
answered
doctor
looby
that
is
one
of
many
reasons
i
have
to
decline
the
how
far
you
are
in
the
right
retorted
fathom
i
leave
the
world
to
judge
after
i
have
observed
that
in
your
english
universities
there
is
no
opportunity
of
studying
the
art
no
not
so
much
as
a
lecture
given
on
the
subject
nor
is
there
one
physician
of
note
in
this
kingdom
who
has
not
derived
the
greatest
part
of
his
medical
knowledge
from
the
instructions
of
looby
incensed
at
this
asseveration
which
he
was
not
prepared
to
refute
exclaimed
in
a
most
infuriate
accent
who
are
you
whence
came
you
where
was
you
bred
you
are
one
of
those
i
believe
who
graduate
themselves
and
commence
doctors
the
lord
knows
how
an
interloper
who
without
licence
or
authority
comes
hither
to
take
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
gentlemen
who
have
been
trained
to
the
business
in
a
regular
manner
and
bestowed
great
pains
and
expense
to
qualify
themselves
for
the
profession
for
my
own
part
my
education
cost
me
fifteen
hundred
never
was
money
laid
out
to
less
purpose
said
ferdinand
for
it
does
not
appear
that
you
have
learned
so
much
as
the
basis
of
medical
requirements
namely
that
decorum
and
urbanity
which
ought
to
distinguish
the
deportment
of
every
physician
you
have
even
debased
the
noblest
and
most
beneficial
art
that
ever
engaged
the
study
of
mankind
which
can
not
be
too
much
cultivated
and
too
little
restrained
in
seeking
to
limit
the
practice
of
it
to
a
set
of
illiberal
wretches
who
like
the
lowest
handicraftsmen
claim
the
exclusive
privileges
of
a
corporation
had
you
doubted
my
ability
you
ought
to
have
satisfied
yourself
in
a
manner
consistent
with
decency
and
candour
but
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
is
such
a
malicious
outrage
upon
good
manners
and
humanity
that
were
it
not
for
my
regard
to
these
ladies
i
would
chastise
you
for
your
insolence
on
the
spot
meanwhile
madam
addressing
himself
to
the
mother
you
must
give
me
leave
to
insist
upon
your
dismissing
either
that
gentleman
or
me
without
this
peremptory
language
had
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
the
hearers
looby
face
grew
pale
and
his
nether
lip
began
to
tremble
the
patient
was
dismayed
and
the
old
gentlewoman
concerned
and
perplexed
she
earnestly
besought
the
gentlemen
to
be
reconciled
to
each
other
and
enter
into
a
friendly
consultation
upon
her
daughter
distemper
but
finding
both
equally
averse
to
accommodation
and
fathom
becoming
more
and
more
importunate
in
his
demand
she
presented
him
with
a
double
fee
and
giving
him
to
understand
that
doctor
looby
had
long
attended
the
family
and
was
intimately
acquainted
with
her
own
and
constitution
said
she
hoped
he
would
not
take
it
amiss
if
she
retained
her
old
physician
though
our
hero
was
much
mortified
at
this
triumph
of
his
rival
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
retired
with
great
complaisance
wishing
that
miss
biddy
might
never
again
be
the
subject
of
such
a
disagreeable
dispute
whether
the
patient
was
frighted
at
this
altercation
or
displeased
with
her
mother
decision
against
an
agreeable
young
fellow
who
had
as
it
were
recalled
her
from
the
grave
and
made
himself
master
of
the
secret
that
rankled
at
her
heart
or
the
disease
had
wound
up
her
nerves
for
another
paroxysm
certain
it
is
she
all
of
a
sudden
broke
forth
into
a
violent
peal
of
laughter
which
was
succeeded
by
the
most
doleful
cries
and
other
expressions
of
grief
then
she
relapsed
into
a
fit
attended
with
strong
convulsions
to
the
unspeakable
terror
of
the
old
gentlewoman
who
entreated
doctor
looby
to
be
expeditious
in
his
prescription
accordingly
he
seized
the
pen
with
great
confidence
and
a
whole
magazine
of
antihysteric
medicines
were
in
different
forms
externally
and
internally
applied
nevertheless
either
nature
was
disturbed
in
her
own
efforts
by
these
applications
or
the
patient
was
resolved
to
disgrace
the
doctor
for
the
more
remedies
that
were
administered
her
convulsions
became
the
more
violent
and
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours
he
could
not
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
distemper
such
a
miscarriage
upon
the
back
of
his
rival
success
could
not
fail
to
overwhelm
him
with
confusion
especially
as
the
mother
baited
him
with
repeated
entreaties
to
do
something
for
the
recovery
of
her
daughter
at
length
after
having
exercised
her
patience
in
vain
for
several
hours
this
affectionate
parent
could
no
longer
suppress
the
suggestions
of
her
concern
but
in
an
incoherent
strain
told
him
that
her
duty
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
longer
silent
in
an
affair
on
which
depended
the
life
of
her
dear
child
that
she
had
seen
enough
to
believe
he
had
mistaken
the
case
of
poor
biddy
and
he
could
not
justly
blame
her
for
recalling
doctor
fathom
whose
prescription
had
operated
in
a
miraculous
manner
looby
shocked
at
this
proposal
protested
against
it
with
great
vehemence
as
an
expedient
highly
injurious
to
himself
my
remedies
said
he
are
just
beginning
to
take
effect
and
in
all
probability
the
fit
will
not
last
much
longer
so
that
by
calling
in
another
person
at
this
juncture
you
will
defraud
me
of
that
credit
which
is
my
due
and
deck
my
adversary
with
trophies
to
which
he
has
no
she
was
prevailed
upon
by
this
remonstrance
to
wait
another
half
hour
when
perceiving
as
yet
no
alteration
for
the
better
and
being
distracted
with
her
fears
which
reproached
her
with
want
of
natural
affection
she
sent
a
message
to
doctor
fathom
desiring
to
see
him
with
all
possible
despatch
he
was
not
slow
in
obeying
the
call
but
hastening
to
the
scene
of
action
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
looby
still
in
the
apartment
this
gentleman
since
better
might
not
be
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
pride
to
his
interest
and
rather
than
lose
his
patient
altogether
and
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
his
reputation
at
the
same
time
stayed
with
intention
to
compromise
his
difference
with
fathom
that
he
might
not
be
wholly
excluded
from
the
honour
of
the
cure
in
case
it
could
be
effected
but
he
had
reckoned
without
his
host
in
his
calculation
of
the
count
placability
for
when
he
put
on
his
capitulating
face
and
after
a
slight
apology
for
his
late
behaviour
proposed
that
all
animosity
should
subside
in
favour
of
the
young
lady
whose
life
was
at
stake
our
hero
rejected
his
advances
with
infinite
disdain
and
assured
the
mother
in
a
very
solemn
tone
that
far
from
consulting
with
a
man
who
had
treated
him
so
unworthily
he
would
not
stay
another
minute
in
the
house
unless
he
should
see
him
discarded
a
satisfaction
barely
sufficient
to
atone
for
the
affront
he
himself
had
suffered
by
the
unjust
preference
she
had
before
given
to
his
rival
there
was
no
remedy
looby
was
obliged
to
retreat
in
his
turn
then
our
adventurer
approaching
the
bedside
reconnoitred
the
patient
examined
the
medicines
which
had
been
administered
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
in
expressive
silence
detached
the
footman
with
a
new
order
to
the
apothecary
it
was
well
the
messenger

otherwise
doctor
fathom
would
have
been
anticipated
by
the
operation
of
nature
for
the
fit
having
almost
run
its
career
miss
biddy
was
on
the
point
of
retrieving
her
senses
when
the
frontal
prescribed
by
fathom
was
applied
to
the
efficacy
of
this
therefore
was
ascribed
her
recovery
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
began
to
pour
forth
unconnected
ejaculations
and
in
a
few
moments
after
she
was
persuaded
to
swallow
a
draught
prepared
for
the
purpose
her
perception
returned
and
ferdinand
gained
the
reputation
of
having
performed
a
second
miracle
but
he
was
furnished
with
a
piece
of
intelligence
of
much
more
energy
than
all
she
had
taken
and
so
soon
as
he
concluded
she
was
capable
to
bear
the
news
without
any
dangerous
emotion
he
among
other
articles
of
culled
for
her
amusement
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
the
company
that
squire
stub
the
cause
of
miss
biddy
disorder
had
in
his
way
to
matrimony
been
robbed
of
his
bride
by
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
had
been
formerly
engaged
he
had
waited
for
her
on
purpose
at
an
inn
on
the
road
where
he
found
means
to
appease
her
displeasure
which
he
had
it
seems
incurred
and
to
supersede
her
new
lover
whom
she
quitted
without
ceremony
upon
which
the
squire
had
returned
to
tunbridge
cursing
her
levity
yet
blessing
his
good
stars
for
having
so
seasonably
prevented
his
ruin
which
would
have
infallibly
been
the
consequence
of
his
marrying
such
an
adventurer
it
would
be
superfluous
to
observe
that
these
tidings
operated
like
an
admirable
specific
on
the
spirits
of
the
young
lady
who
while
she
affected
to
pity
the
squire
was
so
much
overjoyed
at
his
disappointment
that
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
uncommon
vivacity
and
in
less
than
two
hours
after
the
last
of
those
terrible
attacks
she
was
restored
to
a
better
state
of
health
than
she
had
enjoyed
for
many
weeks

forgot
amidst
the
rejoicings
of
the
family
besides
an
handsome
gratuity
for
the
effects
of
his
extraordinary
skill
the
old
lady
favoured
him
with
a
general
invitation
to
her
house
and
the
daughter
not
only
considered
him
as
the
restorer
of
her
health
and
angel
of
her
good
fortune
but
also
began
to
discover
an
uncommon
relish
for
his
conversation
so
that
he
was
struck
with
the
prospect
of
succeeding
squire
stub
in
her
affection
a
conquest
which
if
sanctioned
by
the
approbation
of
the
mother
would
console
him
for
all
the
disappointments
he
had
sustained
for
miss
biddy
was
entitled
to
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
provided
she
should
marry
with
the
consent
of
her
parent
who
was
the
sole
executrix
of
the
father
will
animated
with
the
hope
of
such
an
advantageous
match
our
adventurer
missed
no
opportunity
of
improving
the
lodgment
he
had
made
while
the
two
ladies
failed
not
to
extol
his
medical
capacity
among
all
their
female
acquaintances
by
means
of
this
circulation
his
advice
was
demanded
in
several
other
cases
which
he
managed
with
such
an
imposing
air
of
sagacity
and
importance
that
his
fame
began
to
spread
and
before
the
end
of
the
season
he
had
ravished
more
than
one
half
of
the
business
from
his
competitor
notwithstanding
these
fortunate
events
he
foresaw
that
he
should
find
great
difficulty
in
transplanting
his
reputation
so
as
to
take
root
in
london
which
was
the
only
soil
in
which
he
could
propose
to
rise
to
any
degree
of
prosperity
and
independence
and
this
reflection
was
grounded
upon
a
maxim
which
universally
prevails
among
the
english
people
namely
to
overlook
and
wholly
neglect
on
their
return
to
the
metropolis
all
the
connexions
they
may
have
chanced
to
acquire
during
their
residence
at
any
of
the
medical
wells
and
this
social
disposition
is
so
scrupulously
maintained
that
two
persons
who
lived
in
the
most
intimate
correspondence
at
bath
or
tunbridge
shall
in
hours
so
totally
forget
their
friendship
as
to
meet
in
james
park
without
betraying
the
least
token
of
recognition
so
that
one
would
imagine
these
mineral
waters
were
so
many
streams
issuing
from
the
river
lethe
so
famed
of
old
for
washing
away
all
traces
of
memory
and
recollection
aware
of
this
oblivious
principle
doctor
fathom
collected
all
his
qualifications
in
order
to
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
miss
biddy
as
would
resist
all
her
endeavours
to
shake
him
from
her
remembrance
and
his
efforts
succeeded
so
well
that
squire
advances
to
a
reconciliation
were
treated
with
manifest
indifference
in
all
probability
our
hero
would
have
made
a
very
advantageous
campaign
had
not
his
good
fortune
been
retarded
by
an
obstruction
which
as
he
did
not
perceive
it
he
could
not
possibly
surmount
in
displaying
his
accomplishments
to
captivate
the
daughter
he
had
unwittingly
made
an
absolute
conquest
of
the
mother
who
superintended
the
conduct
of
miss
biddy
with
such
jealous
vigilance
that
he
could
find
no
opportunity
of
profiting
by
the
progress
he
had
made
in
her
heart
for
the
careful
matron
would
never
lose
sight
of
her
no
not
for
one
moment
had
the
old
lady
given
the
least
intimation
to
our
adventurer
of
the
sentiments
she
entertained
in
his
behalf
his
complaisance
was
of
such
a
pliable
texture
that
he
would
have
quitted
his
other
pursuit
and
made
her
the
sole
object
of
his
attention
but
she
either
depended
upon
the
effect
of
his
own
good
taste
and
discernment
or
was
too
proud
to
disclose
a
passion
which
he
had
hitherto
overlooked
chapter
repairs
to
the
metropolis
and
enrols
himself
among
the
sons
of
paean
before
this
affair
could
be
brought
to
a
proper
explanation
the
season
being
almost
ended
the
ladies
departed
from
tunbridge
and
in
a
little
time
doctor
fathom
followed
them
to
london
having
previously
obtained
permission
to
visit
them
in
that
metropolis
he
had
solicited
the
same
favour
of
some
other
families
in
which
he
hoped
to
take
root
though
he
knew
they
were
to
different
physicians
and
resolving
to
make
his
first
medical
appearance
in
london
with
some
eclat
he
not
only
purchased
an
old
chariot
which
was
new
painted
for
the
purpose
but
likewise
hired
a
footman
whom
he
clothed
in
laced
livery
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
common
run
of
his
brethren
this
equipage
though
much
more
expensive
than
his
finances
could
bear
he
found
absolutely
necessary
to
give
him
a
chance
for
employment
as
every
shabby
retainer
to
physic
in
this
capital
had
provided
himself
with
a
vehicle
which
was
altogether
used
by
way
of
a
travelling
to
draw
in
customers
so
that
a
walking
physician
was
considered
as
an
obscure
pedlar
trudging
from
street
to
street
with
his
pack
of
knowledge
on
his
shoulders
and
selling
his
remnants
of
advice
by
retail
a
chariot
was
not
now
set
up
for
the
convenience
of
a
man
sinking
under
the
fatigue
of
extensive
practice
but
as
a
piece
of
furniture
every
way
as
necessary
as
a
large
periwig
with
three
tails
and
a
physician
let
his
merit
in
other
respects
be
never
so
conspicuous
can
no
more
expect
to
become
considerable
in
business
without
the
assistance
of
this
implement
than
he
can
hope
to
live
without
food
or
breathe
without
a
windpipe
this
requisite
is
so
well
understood
that
exclusive
of
those
who
profess
themselves
doctors
every
raw
surgeon
every
idle
apothecary
who
can
make
interest
with
some
foolhardy
coachmaker
may
be
seen
dancing
the
bays
in
all
places
of
public
resort
and
grinning
to
one
another
from
their
respective
carriages
hence
proceed
many
of
those
cruel
accidents
which
are
recorded
in
the
daily
papers
an
apothecary
horses
take
fright
and
run
away
with
his
chariot
which
is
heard
of
no
more
an
eminent
surgeon
being
overturned
is
so
terrified
at
the
thoughts
of
mutilation
that
he
resolves
to
walk
on
foot
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
the
coachman
of
a
physician
of
great
practice
having
the
misfortune
to
be
disabled
by
a
fall
from
the
box
his
master
can
never
find
another
to
supply
his
place
none
of
these
observations
escaped
the
penetrating
eye
of
fathom
who
before
he
pretended
to
seat
himself
in
this
machine
had
made
proper
inquiry
into
all
the
other
methods
practised
with
a
view
to
keep
the
wheels
in
motion
in
his
researches
he
found
that
the
great
world
was
wholly
engrossed
by
a
few
practitioners
who
had
arrived
at
the
summit
of
reputation
consequently
were
no
longer
obliged
to
cultivate
those
arts
by
which
they
rose
and
that
the
rest
of
the
business
was
parcelled
out
into
small
enclosures
occupied
by
different
groups
of
personages
male
and
female
who
stood
in
rings
and
tossed
the
ball
from
one
to
another
there
being
in
each
department
two
sets
the
individuals
of
which
relieved
one
another
occasionally
every
knot
was
composed
of
a
nurse
apothecary
surgeon
and
physician
and
sometimes
a
midwife
was
admitted
into
the
party
and
in
this
manner
the
farce
was
commonly
performed
a
fine
lady
fatigued
with
idleness
complains
of
the
vapours
is
deprived
of
her
rest
though
not
so
sick
as
to
have
recourse
to
medicine
her
favourite
maid
tired
with
giving
her
attendance
in
the
night
thinks
proper
for
the
benefit
of
her
own
repose
to
complain
of
a
violent
headache
and
recommends
to
her
mistress
a
nurse
of
approved
tenderness
and
discretion
at
whose
house
in
all
likelihood
the
said
chambermaid
hath
oft
given
the
rendezvous
to
a
male
friend
the
nurse
well
skilled
in
the
mysteries
of
her
occupation
persuades
the
patient
that
her
malady
far
from
being
slight
or
chimerical
may
proceed
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
the
hysterical
affection
unless
it
be
nipt
in
the
bud
by
some
very
effectual
remedy
then
she
recounts
a
surprising
cure
performed
by
a
certain
apothecary
and
appeals
to
the
testimony
of
the
who
being
the
gossip
of
his
wife
confirms
the
evidence
and
corroborates
the
proposal
the
apothecary
being
summoned
finds
her
ladyship
in
such
a
delicate
situation
that
he
declines
prescribing
and
advises
her
to
send
for
a
physician
without
delay
the
nomination
of
course
falls
to
him
and
the
doctor
being
called
declares
the
necessity
of
immediate
venesection
which
is
accordingly
performed
by
a
surgeon
of
the
association
this
is
one
way
of
beginning
the
game
though
the
commencement
often
varies
and
sometimes
the
apothecary
and
sometimes
the
physician
opens
the
scene
but
be
that
as
it
will
they
always
appear
in
a
string
like
a
flight
of
wild
geese
and
each
confederacy
maintains
a
correspondence
with
one
particular
undertaker
fathom
upon
these
considerations
set
up
his
rest
in
the
first
floor
of
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
of
charing
cross
to
whom
he
was
introduced
by
a
letter
from
a
friend
at
tunbridge
and
who
being
made
acquainted
with
his
ability
and
scheme
promised
to
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
serving
him
and
indeed
seemed
to
espouse
his
interest
with
great
alacrity
he
introduced
him
to
some
of
his
patients
on
the
strength
of
a
gratis
visit
sounded
forth
his
praise
among
all
the
good
women
of
his
acquaintance
and
even
prevailed
upon
him
to
publish
advertisements
importing
that
he
would
every
day
at
a
certain
time
and
place
give
his
advice
to
the
poor
for
nothing
hoping
that
by
means
of
some
lucky
cure
his
fame
might
be
extended
and
his
practice
grow
into
request
in
the
meantime
his
chariot
rolled
along
through
all
the
most
frequented
streets
during
the
whole
forenoon
and
at
the
usual
hour
he
never
failed
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
medical
with
all
that
solemnity
of
feature
and
address
by
which
the
modern
sons
of
paean
are
distinguished
not
but
that
he
was
often
puzzled
about
the
decision
of
his
diurnal
route
for
the
method
of
driving
up
one
street
and
down
another
without
halting
was
become
such
a
stale
expedient
that
the
very
used
to
stand
at
the
shop
doors
and
ridicule
the
vain
parade
at
length
however
he
perused
the
map
of
london
with
great
diligence
and
having
acquired
a
distinct
idea
of
its
topography
used
to
alight
at
the
end
of
long
narrow
thoroughfares
and
paved
courts
where
the
chariot
was
ordered
to
wait
till
his
return
and
walking
with
great
gravity
through
the
different
turnings
of
these
alleys
regain
his
carriage
by
another
passage
and
resume
his
seat
with
an
air
of
vast
importance
with
a
view
to
protract
the
time
of
his
supposed
visits
he
would
at
one
place
turn
aside
to
a
wall
at
another
cheapen
an
urinal
at
a
third
corner
read
a
quack
advertisement
or
lounge
a
few
minutes
in
some
bookseller
shop
and
lastly
glide
into
some
obscure
and
treat
himself
with
a
dram
of
usquebaugh
the
other
means
used
to
force
a
trade
such
as
ordering
himself
to
be
called
from
church
alarming
the
neighbourhood
with
knocking
at
his
door
in
the
night
receiving
sudden
messages
in
places
of
resort
and
inserting
his
cures
by
way
of
news
in
the
daily
papers
had
been
so
injudiciously
hackneyed
by
every
desperate
sculler
in
physic
that
they
had
lost
their
effect
upon
the
public
and
therefore
were
excluded
from
the
plan
of
our
adventurer
whose
scheme
for
the
present
was
to
exert
himself
in
winning
the
favour
of
those
sage
sibyls
who
keep
as
it
were
the
temple
of
medicine
and
admit
the
young
priest
to
the
service
of
the
altar
but
this
he
considered
as
a
temporary
project
only
until
he
should
have
acquired
interest
enough
to
erect
an
hospital
lock
or
infirmary
by
the
voluntary
subscription
of
his
friends
a
scheme
which
had
succeeded
to
a
miracle
with
many
of
the
profession
who
had
raised
themselves
into
notice
upon
the
carcases
of
the
poor
yet
even
this
branch
was
already
overstocked
insomuch
that
almost
every
street
was
furnished
with
one
of
these
charitable
receptacles
which
instead
of
diminishing
the
taxes
for
the
maintenance
of
the
poor
encouraged
the
vulgar
to
be
idle
and
dissolute
by
opening
an
asylum
to
them
and
their
families
from
the
diseases
of
poverty
and
intemperance
for
it
remains
to
be
proved
that
the
parish
rates
are
decreased
the
bills
of
mortality
lessened
the
people
more
numerous
or
the
streets
less
infested
with
beggars
notwithstanding
the
immense
sums
yearly
granted
by
individuals
for
the
relief
of
the
indigent
but
waiving
these
reflections
doctor
fathom
hoped
that
his
landlord
would
be
a
most
useful
implement
for
extending
his
influence
and
for
that
reason
admitted
him
into
a
degree
of
partnership
after
being
fully
convinced
that
he
was
not
under
articles
to
any
other
physician
nevertheless
he
was
very
much
mistaken
in
reckoning
on
the
importance
of
his
new
ally
who
was
like
himself
a
needy
adventurer
settled
upon
credit
and
altogether
unemployed
except
among
the
very
refuse
of
the
people
whom
no
other
person
would
take
the
trouble
to
attend
so
that
our
hero
got
little
else
than
experience
and
trouble
excepting
a
few
guineas
which
he
made
shift
to
glean
among
sojourners
with
whom
he
became
occasionally
acquainted
or
young
people
who
had
been
unfortunate
in
their
amours
in
the
midst
of
these
endeavours
he
did
not
omit
his
duty
to
the
old
gentlewoman
whose
daughter
he
had
cured
at
tunbridge
and
was
always
received
with
particular
complacency
which
perhaps
he
in
some
measure
owed
to
his
genteel
equipage
that
gave
credit
to
every
door
before
which
it
was
seen
yet
miss
biddy
was
as
inaccessible
as
ever
while
the
mother
became
more
and
more
warm
in
her
civilities
till
at
length
after
having
prepared
him
with
some
extraordinary
compliments
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
biddy
was
no
better
than
a
girl
far
from
being
unexceptionable
in
her
moral
character
and
particularly
deficient
in
duty
and
gratitude
to
her
who
had
been
always
a
tender
and
indulgent
parent
she
was
therefore
determined
to
punish
the
young
minx
for
her
levity
and
want
of
natural
affection
by
altering
her
own
condition
could
she
find
a
worthy
and
agreeable
man
on
whom
she
could
bestow
her
hand
and
fortune
without
a
blush
the
film
was
instantly
removed
from
fathom
eyes
by
this
declaration
which
she
uttered
with
such
a
significancy
of
look
as
thrilled
to
his
soul
with
joyful
presage
while
he
replied
it
would
indeed
be
a
difficult
task
to
find
a
man
who
merited
such
happiness
and
honour
but
surely
some
there
were
who
would
task
their
faculties
to
the
uttermost
in
manifesting
their
gratitude
and
desire
of
rendering
themselves
worthy
of
such
distinction
though
this
answer
was
pronounced
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
her
to
understand
he
had
taken
the
hint
she
would
not
cheapen
her
condescension
so
much
as
to
explain
herself
further
at
that
juncture
and
he
was
very
well
contented
to
woo
her
on
her
own
terms
accordingly
he
began
to
season
his
behaviour
with
a
spice
of
gallantry
when
he
had
opportunities
of
being
particular
with
this
new
inamorata
and
in
proportion
to
the
returns
she
made
he
gradually
detached
himself
from
miss
biddy
by
intermitting
and
at
last
discontinuing
those
ardent
expressions
of
love
and
admiration
which
he
had
made
shift
to
convey
in
private
looks
and
stolen
whispers
during
the
rancorous
inspection
of
her
mother
such
alteration
could
not
long
escape
the
jealous
eyes
of
the
young
lady
no
more
than
the
cause
of
this
alienation
which
in
a
moment
converted
all
her
love
into
irreconcilable
hate
and
filled
her
whole
soul
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
vengeance
for
she
now
not
only
considered
him
as
a
mercenary
wretch
who
had
slighted
her
attractions
for
the
sordid
gratifications
of
avarice
but
also
as
an
interloper
who
wanted
to
intercept
her
fortune
in
the
odious
character
of
a
but
before
she
could
bring
her
aim
to
any
ripeness
of
contrivance
her
mother
having
caught
cold
at
church
was
seized
with
a
rheumatic
fever
became
delirious
in
less
than
three
days
and
notwithstanding
all
the
prescriptions
and
care
of
her
admirer
gave
up
the
ghost
without
having

from
answering

a
quite
contrary
effect
for
in

of
her
invectives

was
in

days
called
to
the
wife
of
a
merchant

piously
hoped
that
his
practice
would
not
give

lie
the
patient
had

lingered
under

doctor

was
in
no

the
husband
growing
impatient
of
delay
and
so
explicit
in
his
hints
that
it
was
impossible
to
misapprehend
his
meaning
our
adventurer
resolved
to
do
something
effectual
for
his
satisfaction
and
prescribed
a
medicine
of
such
rough
operation
as
he
thought
must
either
oblige
his
employer
or
produce
a
change
in
the
lady

that
would
make
a
noise
in

world
and
bring
a
new
accession
to
his
fame
proceeding
upon
these
maxims
he
could
not
be
disappointed
the
remedy
played
its
part
with
such
violence
as
reduced
the
patient
to
extremity
and
the
merchant
had
actually
bespoke
an
undertaker
when
after
a
series
of
swoonings
and
convulsions
nature
so
far
prevailed
as
to
expel
at
once
the
prescription
and
the
disease
yet
the
husband
was
so
much
affected
with
the
agonies
to
which
he
saw
the
wife
of
his
bosom
exposed
by
this
specific
that
although
the
effect
of
it
was
her
perfect
recovery
he
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
fathom
for
the
future
nor
even
hear
his
name
mentioned
without
giving
signs
of
horror
and
indignation
nay
he
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
had
our
adventurer
been
endowed
with
the
least
tincture
of
humanity
he
would
have
suffered
the
poor
woman
to
depart
in
peace
rather
than
restore
her
to
health
at
the
expense
of
such
anxiety
and
torture
on
the
other
hand
this
extraordinary
cure
was
blazoned
abroad
by
the
good
lady
and
her
gossips
with
such
exaggerations
as
roused
the
astonishment
of
the
public
and
concurred
with
the
report
of
his
last
miscarriage
to
bring
him
upon
the
carpet
as
the
universal
subject
of
discourse
when
a
physician
becomes
the
town
talk
he
generally
concludes
his
business
more
than
half
done
even
though
his
fame
should
wholly
turn
upon
his
malpractice
insomuch
that
some
members
of
the
faculty
have
been
heard
to
complain
that
they
never
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
publicly
accused
of
homicide
and
it
is
well
known
that
a
certain
famous
empiric
of
our
day
never
flourished
to
any
degree
of
wealth
and
reputation
till
after
he
had
been
attacked
in
print
and
fairly
convicted
of
having
destroyed
a
good
number
of
the
human
species
success
raised
upon
such
a
foundation
would
by
a
disciple
of
plato
and
some
modern
moralists
be
ascribed
to
the
innate
virtue
and
generosity
of
the
human
heart
which
naturally
espouses
the
cause
that
needs
protection
but
i
whose
notions
of
human
excellence
are
not
quite
so
sublime
am
apt
to
believe
it
is
owing
to
that
spirit
of
and
contradiction
which
is
at
least
as
universal
if
not
as
natural
as
the
moral
sense
so
warmly
contended
for
by
those
ideal
philosophers
the
most
infamous
wretch
often
finds
his
account
in
these
principles
of
malevolence
and
for
wheresoever
his
character
falls
under
discussion
there
is
generally
some
person
present
who
either
from
an
affectation
of
singularity
or
envy
to
the
accusers
undertakes
his
defence
and
endeavours
to
invalidate
the
articles
of
his
impeachment
until
he
is
heated
by
altercation
and
hurried
into
more
effectual
measures
for
his
advantage
if
such
benefits
accrue
to
those
who
have
no
real
merit
to
depend
upon
surely
our
hero
could
not
but
reap
something
extraordinary
from
the
debates
to
which
he
now
gave
rise
as
by
the
miraculous
cure
he
had
affected
all
his
patient
friends
all
the
enemies
of
her
husband
all
those
who
envied
his
other
adversary
were
interested
in
his
behalf
exclusive
of
such
admirers
as
surprise
and
curiosity
might
engage
in
his
cause
thus
wafted
upon
the
wings
of
applause
his
fame
soon
diffused
itself
into
all
the
corners
of
this
great
capital
the
newspapers
teemed
with
his
praise
and
in
order
to
keep
up
the
attention
of
the
public
his
emissaries
male
and
female
separated
into
different
companies
and
clubs
where
they
did
not
fail
to
comment
upon
these
articles
of
intelligence
such
a
favourable
incident
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
float
the
bark
of
a
man
fortune
he
was
in
a
few
days
called
to
another
lady
labouring
under
the
same
disorder
he
had
so
successfully
dispelled
and
she
thought
herself
benefited
by
his
advice
his
acquaintance
naturally
extended
itself
among
the
visitants
and
allies
of
his
patients
he
was
recommended
from
family
to
family
the
fees
began
to
multiply
a
variety
of
footmen
appeared
every
day
at
his
door
he
discontinued
his
sham
circuit
and
looking
upon
the
present
conjuncture
as
that
tide
in
his
affairs
which
according
to
shakespeare
when
taken
at
the
full
leads
on
to
fortune
he
resolved
that
the
opportunity
should
not
be
lost
and
applied
himself
with
such
assiduity
to
his
practice
that
in
all
likelihood
he
would
have
carried
the
palm
from
all
his
contemporaries
had
he
not
split
upon
the
same
rock
which
had
shipwrecked
his
hopes
before
we
have
formerly
descanted
upon
that
venereal
appetite
which
glowed
in
the
constitution
of
our
adventurer
and
with
all
his
philosophy
and
caution
could
hardly
keep
within
bounds
the
reader
therefore
will
not
be
much
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
he
contracted
an
intimacy
with
a
clergyman
wife
whom
he
attended
as
a
physician
and
whose
conjugal
virtue
he
subdued
by
a
long
and
diligent
exertion
of
his
delusive
arts
while
her
mind
was
enervated
by
sickness
and
her
husband
abroad
upon
his
necessary
occasions
this
unhappy
patient
who
was
a
woman
of
an
agreeable
person
and
lively
conversation
fell
a
sacrifice
to
her
own
security
and
her
want
of
health
had
confined
her
to
a
sedentary
life
and
her
imagination
being
active
and
restless
she
had
spent
those
hours
in
reading
which
other
young
women
devote
to
company
and
diversion
but
as
her
studies
were
not
superintended
by
any
person
of
taste
she
had
indulged
her
own
fancy
without
method
or
propriety
the
spectator
taught
her
to
be
a
critic
and
philosopher
from
plays
she
learned
poetry
and
wit
and
derived
her
knowledge
of
life
from
books
of
history
and
adventures
fraught
with
these
acquisitions
and
furnished
by
nature
with
uncommon
vivacity
she
despised
her
own
sex
and
courted
the
society
of
men
among
whom
she
thought
her
talents
might
be
more
honourably
displayed
fully
confident
of
her
own
virtue
and
sagacity
which
enabled
her
to
set
all
their
arts
at
defiance
thus
qualified
she
in
an
evil
hour
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
for
some
ailment
under
which
she
had
long
laboured
and
found
such
relief
from
his
skill
as
very
much
prepossessed
her
in
his
favour
she
was
no
less
pleased
with
his
obliging
manners
than
with
his
physic
and
found
much
entertainment
in
his
conversation
so
that
the
acquaintance
proceeded
to
a
degree
of
intimacy
during
which
he
perceived
her
weak
side
and
being
enamoured
of
her
person
flattered
her
out
of
all
her
caution
the
privilege
of
his
character
furnished
him
with
opportunities
to
lay
snares
for
her
virtue
and
taking
advantage
of
that
listlessness
languor
and
indolence
of
the
spirits
by
which
all
the
vigilance
of
the
soul
is
relaxed
he
after
a
long
course
of
attention
and
perseverance
found
means
to
make
shipwreck
of
her
peace
though
he
mastered
her
chastity
he
could
not
quiet
her
conscience
which
incessantly
upbraided
her
with
breach
of
the
marriage
vow
nor
did
her
undoer
escape
without
a
share
of
the
reproaches
suggested
by
her
penitence
and
remorse
this
internal
anxiety
with
her
disease
and
perhaps
with
the
medicines
he
prescribed
reduced
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
when
her
husband
returned
from
a
neighbouring
kingdom
in
consequence
of
her
earnest
request
joined
to
the
information
of
her
friends
who
had
written
to
him
an
account
of
the
extremity
in
which
she
was
the
good
man
was
afflicted
beyond
measure
when
he
saw
himself
upon
the
verge
of
losing
a
wife
whom
he
had
always
tenderly
loved
but
what
were
his
emotions
when
she
taking
the
first
opportunity
of
his
being
alone
with
her
accosted
him
to
this
effect
i
am
now
hastening
towards
that
dissolution
from
which
no
mortal
is
exempted
and
though
the
prospect
of
futurity
is
altogether
clouded
and
uncertain
my
conscience
will
not
allow
me
to
plunge
into
eternity
without
unburdening
my
mind
and
by
an
ingenuous
confession
making
all
the
atonement
in
my
power
for
the
ingratitude
i
have
been
guilty
of
and
the
wrongs
i
have
committed
against
a
virtuous
husband
who
never
gave
me
cause
of
complaint
you
stand
amazed
at
this
preamble
but
alas
how
will
you
be
shocked
when
i
own
that
i
have
betrayed
you
in
your
absence
that
i
have
trespassed
against
god
and
my
marriage
vow
and
fallen
from
the
pride
and
confidence
of
virtue
to
the
most
abject
state
of
vice
yes
i
have
been
unfaithful
to
your
bed
having
fallen
a
victim
to
the
infernal
insinuations
of
a
villain
who
took
advantage
of
my
weak
and
unguarded
moments
fathom
is
the
wretch
who
hath
thus
injured
your
honour
and
ruined
my
unsuspecting
innocence
i
have
nothing
to
plead
in
alleviation
of
my
crime
but
the
most
sincere
contrition
of
heart
and
though
at
any
other
juncture
i
could
not
expect
your
forgiveness
yet
as
i
now
touch
the
goal
of
life
i
trust
in
your
humanity
and
benevolence
for
that
pardon
which
will
lighten
the
sorrows
of
my
soul
and
those
prayers
which
i
hope
will
entitle
me
to
favour
at
the
throne
of
the
poor
husband
was
so
much
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
confusion
at
this
unexpected
address
that
he
could
not
recollect
himself
till
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
when
uttering
a
hollow
groan
i
will
not
said
he
aggravate
your
sufferings
by
reproaching
you
with
my
wrongs
though
your
conduct
hath
been
but
an
ill
return
for
all
my
tenderness
and
esteem
i
look
upon
it
as
a
trial
of
my
christian
patience
and
bear
my
misfortune
with
resignation
meanwhile
i
forgive
you
from
my
heart
and
fervently
pray
that
your
repentance
may
be
acceptable
to
the
father
of
so
saying
he
approached
her
bedside
and
embraced
her
in
token
of
his
sincerity
whether
this
generous
condescension
diffused
such
a
composure
upon
her
spirits
as
tended
to
the
ease
and
refreshment
of
nature
which
had
been
almost
exhausted
by
disease
and
vexation
certain
it
is
that
from
this
day
she
began
to
struggle
with
her
malady
in
surprising
efforts
and
hourly
gained
ground
until
her
health
was
pretty
well
this
recovery
was
so
far
beyond
the
husband
expectation
that
he
began
to
make
very
serious
reflections
on
the
event
and
even
to
wish
he
had
not
been
quite
so
precipitate
in
pardoning
the
backslidings
of
his
wife
for
though
he
could
not
withhold
his
compassion
from
a
dying
penitent
he
did
not
at
all
relish
the
thoughts
of
cohabiting
as
usual
with
a
wife
of
the
violation
of
the
matrimonial
contract
he
therefore
considered
his
declaration
as
no
more
than
a
provisional
pardon
to
take
place
on
condition
of
her
immediate
death
and
in
a
little
time
not
only
communicated
to
her
his
sentiments
on
this
subject
but
also
separated
himself
from
her
company
secured
the
evidence
of
her
maid
who
had
been
confidant
in
her
amour
with
fathom
and
immediately
set
on
foot
a
prosecution
against
our
adventurer
whose
behaviour
to
his
wife
he
did
not
fail
to
promulgate
with
all
its
aggravating
circumstances
by
these
means
the
doctor
name
became
so
notorious
that
every
man
was
afraid
of
admitting
him
into
his
house
and
every
woman
ashamed
of
soliciting
his
advice
chapter
his
eclipse
and
gradual
declination
misfortunes
seldom
come
single
upon
the
back
of
this
hue
and
cry
he
unluckily
prescribed
phlebotomy
to
a
gentleman
of
some
rank
who
chanced
to
expire
during
the
operation
and
quarrelled
with
his
landlord
the
apothecary
who
charged
him
with
having
forgot
the
good
offices
he
had
done
him
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
and
desired
he
would
provide
himself
with
another
lodging
all
these
mishaps
treading
upon
the
heels
of
one
another
had
a
very
mortifying
effect
upon
his
practice
at
every
his
name
was
occasionally
put
to
the
torture
with
that
of
the
vile
creature
whom
he
had
seduced
though
it
was
generally
taken
for
granted
by
all
those
female
casuists
that
she
must
have
made
the
first
advances
for
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
any
man
would
take
much
trouble
in
laying
schemes
for
the
ruin
of
a
person
whose
attractions
were
so
slender
especially
considering
the
ill
state
of
her
health
a
circumstance
that
seldom
adds
to
a
woman
beauty
or
besides
she
was
always
a
pert
minx
that
affected
singularity
and
a
masculine
manner
of
speaking
and
many
of
them
had
foreseen
that
she
would
some
time
or
other
bring
herself
into
such
a
premunire
at
all
gossipings
where
the
apothecary
or
his
wife
assisted
fathom
pride
ingratitude
and
malpractice
were
canvassed
in
all
clubs
of
married
men
he
was
mentioned
with
marks
of
abhorrence
and
detestation
and
every
medical
rung
with
his
reproach
instances
of
his
ignorance
and
presumption
were
quoted
and
many
particulars
feigned
for
the
purpose
of
defamation
so
that
our
hero
was
exactly
in
the
situation
of
a
horseman
who
in
riding
at
full
speed
for
the
plate
is
thrown
from
the
saddle
in
the
middle
of
the
race
and
left
without
sense
or
motion
upon
the
plain
his
progress
though
rapid
had
been
so
short
that
he
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
laid
up
store
against
such
a
day
of
trouble
and
as
he
still
cherished
hopes
of
surmounting
those
obstacles
which
had
so
suddenly
started
up
in
his
way
he
would
not
resign
his
equipage
nor
retrench
his
expenses
but
appeared
as
usual
in
all
public
places
with
that
serenity
and
confidence
of
feature
which
he
had
never
deposited
and
maintained
his
external
pomp
upon
the
little
he
had
reserved
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
and
the
credit
he
had
acquired
by
the
punctuality
of
his
former
payments
both
these
funds
however
failed
in
a
very
little
time
his
lawsuit
was
a
gulf
that
swallowed
up
all
his
ready
money
and
the
gleanings
of
his
practice
were
scarce
sufficient
to
answer
his
pocket
expenses
which
now
increased
in
proportion
to
the
decrease
of
business
for
as
he
had
more
idle
time
and
was
less
admitted
into
private
families
so
he
thought
he
had
more
occasion
to
enlarge
his
acquaintance
among
his
own
sex
who
alone
were
able
to
support
him
in
his
disgrace
with
the
other
he
accordingly
listed
himself
in
several
clubs
and
endeavoured
to
monopolise
the
venereal
branch
of
trade
though
this
was
but
an
indifferent
resource
for
almost
all
his
patients
of
this
class
were
such
as
either
could
not
or
would
not
properly
recompense
the
physician
for
some
time
he
lingered
in
this
situation
without
going
upwards
or
downwards
floating
like
a
wisp
of
straw
at
the
turning
of
the
tide
until
he
could
no
longer
amuse
the
person
of
whom
he
had
hired
his
or
postpone
the
other
demands
which
multiplied
upon
him
every
day
then
was
his
chariot
overturned
with
a
hideous
crash
and
his
face
so
much
wounded
with
the
shivers
of
the
glass
which
went
to
pieces
in
the
fall
that
he
appeared
in
the
with
half
a
dozen
black
patches
upon
his
countenance
gave
a
most
circumstantial
detail
of
the
risk
he
had
run
and
declared
that
he
did
not
believe
he
should
ever
hazard
himself
again
in
any
sort
of
wheel
carriage
soon
after
this
accident
he
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
his
friends
in
the
same
public
place
that
he
had
turned
away
his
footman
on
account
of
his
drunkenness
and
was
resolved
for
the
future
to
keep
none
but
maids
in
his
service
because
the
menservants
are
generally
impudent
lazy
debauched
or
dishonest
and
after
all
neither
so
neat
handy
or
agreeable
as
the
other
sex
in
the
rear
of
this
resolution
he
shifted
his
lodgings
into
a
private
court
being
distracted
with
the
din
of
carriages
that
disturb
the
inhabitants
who
live
towards
the
open
street
and
gave
his
acquaintance
to
understand
that
he
had
a
medical
work
upon
the
anvil
which
he
could
not
finish
without
being
indulged
in
silence
and
tranquillity
in
effect
he
gradually
put
on
the
exteriors
of
an
author
his
watch
with
an
horizontal
movement
by
graham
which
he
had
often
mentioned
and
shown
as
a
very
curious
piece
of
workmanship
began
about
this
time
to
be
very
much
out
of
order
and
was
committed
to
the
care
of
a
mender
who
was
in
no
hurry
to
restore
it
his
degenerated
into
a
major
he
sometimes
appeared
without
a
sword
and
was
even
observed
in
public
with
a
second
day
shirt
at
last
his
clothes
became
rusty
and
when
he
walked
about
the
streets
his
head
turned
round
in
a
surprising
manner
by
an
involuntary
motion
in
his
neck
which
he
had
contracted
by
a
habit
of
reconnoitring
the
ground
that
he
might
avoid
all
dangerous
or
disagreeable
encounters
fathom
finding
himself
descending
the
hill
of
fortune
with
an
acquired
gravitation
strove
to
catch
at
every
twig
in
order
to
stop
or
retard
his
descent
he
now
regretted
the
opportunities
he
had
neglected
of
marrying
one
of
several
women
of
moderate
fortune
who
had
made
advances
to
him
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
and
endeavoured
by
forcing
himself
into
a
lower
path
of
life
than
any
he
had
hitherto
trod
to
keep
himself
afloat
with
the
portion
of
some
tradesman
daughter
whom
he
meant
to
espouse
while
he
exerted
himself
in
this
pursuit
he
happened
in
returning
from
a
place
about
thirty
miles
from
london
to
become
acquainted
in
the
with
a
young
woman
of
a
very
homely
appearance
whom
from
the
driver
information
he
understood
to
be
the
niece
of
a
country
justice
and
daughter
of
a
who
had
lived
and
died
in
london
and
left
her
in
her
infancy
sole
heiress
of
his
effects
which
amounted
to
four
thousand
pounds
the
uncle
who
was
her
guardian
had
kept
her
sacred
from
the
knowledge
of
the
world
resolving
to
effect
a
match
betwixt
her
and
his
own
son
and
it
was
with
much
difficulty
he
had
consented
to
this
journey
which
she
had
undertaken
as
a
visit
to
her
own
mother
who
had
married
a
second
husband
in
town
fraught
with
these
anecdotes
fathom
began
to
put
forth
his
gallantry
and
and
in
a
word
was
admitted
by
the
lady
to
the
privilege
of
an
acquaintance
in
which
capacity
he
visited
her
during
the
term
of
her
residence
in
london
and
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
declared
his
honourable
intentions
he
had
such
a
manifest
advantage
in
point
of
personal
accomplishments
over
the
young
gentleman
who
was
destined
for
her
husband
that
she
did
not
disdain
his
proposals
and
before
she
set
out
for
the
country
he
had
made
such
progress
in
her
heart
that
the
day
was
actually
fixed
for
their
nuptials
on
which
he
faithfully
promised
to
carry
her
off
in
a
coach
and
six
how
to
raise
money
for
this
expedition
was
all
the
difficulty
that
remained
for
by
this
time
his
finances
were
utterly
dried
up
and
his
credit
altogether
exhausted
upon
a
very
pressing
occasion
he
had
formerly
applied
himself
to
a
certain
wealthy
quack
who
had
relieved
his
necessities
by
lending
him
a
small
sum
of
money
in
return
for
having
communicated
to
him
a
secret
medicine
which
he
affirmed
to
be
the
most
admirable
specific
that
ever
was
invented
the
nostrum
had
been
used
and
luckily
for
him
succeeded
in
the
trial
so
that
the
empiric
in
the
midst
of
his
satisfaction
began
to
reflect
that
this
same
fathom
who
pretended
to
be
in
possession
of
a
great
many
remedies
equally
efficacious
would
certainly
become
a
formidable
rival
to
him
in
his
business
should
he
ever
be
able
to
extricate
himself
from
his
present
difficulties
in
consequence
of
these
suggestions
he
resolved
to
keep
our
head
under
water
by
maintaining
him
in
the
most
abject
dependence
accordingly
he
had
from
time
to
time
accommodated
him
with
small
trifles
which
barely
served
to
support
his
existence
and
even
for
these
had
taken
notes
of
hand
that
he
might
have
a
scourge
over
his
head
in
case
he
should
prove
insolent
or
refractory
to
this
benefactor
fathom
applied
for
a
reinforcement
of
twenty
guineas
which
he
solicited
with
the
more
confidence
as
that
sum
would
certainly
enable
him
to
repay
all
other
obligations
the
quack
would
advance
the
money
upon
no
other
condition
than
that
of
knowing
the
scheme
which
being
explained
he
complied
with
ferdinand
request
but
at
the
same
time
privately
despatched
an
express
to
the
young
lady
uncle
with
a
full
account
of
the
whole
conspiracy
so
that
when
the
doctor
arrived
at
the
inn
according
to
appointment
he
was
received
by
his
worship
in
person
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
niece
had
changed
her
mind
and
gone
fifty
miles
farther
into
the
country
to
visit
a
relation
this
was
a
grievous
disappointment
to
fathom
who
really
believed
his
mistress
had
forsaken
him
through
mere
levity
and
caprice
and
was
not
undeceived
till
several
months
after
her
marriage
with
her
cousin
when
at
an
accidental
meeting
in
london
she
explained
the
story
of
the
secret
intelligence
and
excused
her
marriage
as
the
effect
of
rigorous
usage
and
compulsion
had
our
hero
been
really
enamoured
of
her
person
he
might
have
probably
accomplished
his
wishes
notwithstanding
the
steps
she
had
taken
but
this
was
not
the
case
his
passion
was
of
a
different
nature
and
the
object
of
it
effectually
without
his
reach
with
regard
to
his
appetite
for
women
as
it
was
an
infirmity
of
his
constitution
which
he
could
not
overcome
and
as
he
was
in
no
condition
to
gratify
it
at
a
great
expense
he
had
of
late
chosen
a
housekeeper
from
the
hundreds
of
drury
and
to
avoid
scandal
allowed
her
to
assume
his
name
as
to
the
intimation
which
had
been
sent
to
the
country
justice
he
immediately
imputed
it
to
the
true
author
whom
he
marked
for
his
vengeance
accordingly
but
in
the
meantime
suppressed
his
resentment
because
he
in
some
measure
depended
upon
him
for
subsistence
on
the
other
hand
the
quack
dreading
the
forwardness
and
plausibility
of
our
hero
which
might
one
time
or
other
render
him
independent
put
a
stop
to
those
supplies
on
pretence
of
finding
them
inconvenient
but
out
of
his
friendship
and
goodwill
to
fathom
undertook
to
procure
for
him
such
letters
of
recommendation
as
would
infallibly
make
his
fortune
in
the
west
indies
and
even
to
set
him
out
in
a
genteel
manner
for
the
voyage
ferdinand
perceived
his
drift
and
thanked
him
for
his
generous
offer
which
he
would
not
fail
to
consider
with
all
due
deliberation
though
he
was
determined
against
the
proposal
but
obliged
to
temporise
that
he
might
not
incur
the
displeasure
of
this
man
at
whose
mercy
he
lay
meanwhile
the
prosecution
against
him
in
doctors
commons
drew
near
a
period
and
the
lawyers
were
clamorous
for
money
without
which
he
foresaw
he
should
lose
the
advantage
which
his
cause
had
lately
acquired
by
the
death
of
his
antagonist
chief
evidence
he
therefore
seeing
every
other
channel
shut
up
began
to
doubt
whether
the
risk
of
being
apprehended
or
slain
in
the
character
of
a
highwayman
was
not
overbalanced
by
the
prospect
of
being
acquitted
of
a
charge
which
had
ruined
his
reputation
and
fortune
and
actually
entertained
thoughts
of
taking
the
air
on
hounslow
heath
when
he
was
diverted
from
this
expedient
by
a
very
singular
adventure
chapter
after
divers
unsuccessful
efforts
he
has
recourse
to
the
matrimonial
noose
chancing
to
meet
with
one
of
his
acquaintance
at
a
certain
the
discourse
turned
upon
the
characters
of
mankind
when
among
other
oddities
his
friend
brought
upon
the
carpet
a
certain
old
gentlewoman
of
such
a
rapacious
disposition
that
like
a
jackdaw
she
never
beheld
any
metalline
substance
without
an
inclination
and
even
an
effort
to
secrete
it
for
her
own
use
and
contemplation
nor
was
this
infirmity
originally
produced
from
indigence
inasmuch
as
her
circumstances
had
been
always
affluent
and
she
was
now
possessed
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
funds
notwithstanding
which
the
avarice
of
her
nature
tempted
her
to
let
lodgings
though
few
people
could
live
under
the
same
roof
with
such
an
original
who
rather
than
be
idle
had
often
filched
pieces
of
her
own
plate
and
charged
her
servants
with
the
theft
or
hinted
suspicion
of
her
lodgers
fathom
struck
with
the
description
soon
perceived
how
this
woman
disease
might
be
converted
to
his
advantage
and
after
having
obtained
sufficient
intelligence
on
pretence
of
satisfying
his
curiosity
he
visited
the
widow
in
consequence
of
a
bill
at
her
door
and
actually
hired
an
apartment
in
her
house
whither
he
forthwith
repaired
with
his
inamorata
it
was
not
long
before
he
perceived
that
his
landlady
character
had
not
been
misrepresented
he
fed
her
distemper
with
divers
inconsiderable
trinkets
such
as
copper
medals
corkscrews
odd
buckles
and
a
paltry
seal
set
in
silver
which
were
at
different
times
laid
as
baits
for
her
infirmity
and
always
conveyed
away
with
remarkable
eagerness
which
he
and
his
dulcinea
took
pleasure
in
observing
from
an
unsuspected
place
thus
confirmed
in
his
opinion
he
at
length
took
an
opportunity
of
exposing
a
metal
watch
that
belonged
to
his
mistress
and
saw
it
seized
with
great
satisfaction
in
the
absence
of
his
helpmate
who
had
gone
abroad
on
purpose
according
to
instruction
she
soon
returned
and
began
to
raise
a
terrible
clamour
about
the
loss
of
her
watch
upon
which
she
was
condoled
by
her
landlady
who
seemed
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
maid
and
even
proposed
that
fathom
should
apply
to
some
justice
of
the
peace
for
a
warrant
to
search
the
servant
trunk
the
lady
thanked
her
for
the
good
advice
in
compliance
with
which
she
had
immediate
recourse
to
a
magistrate
who
granted
a
search
warrant
not
against
the
maid
but
the
mistress
and
she
in
a
little
time
returned
with
the
constable
at
her
back
these
precautions
being
taken
doctor
fathom
desired
a
private
conference
with
the
old
gentlewoman
in
which
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
had
undoubted
proofs
of
her
having
secreted
not
only
the
watch
but
also
several
other
odd
things
of
less
consequence
which
he
lost
since
his
residence
in
her
house
he
then
showed
the
warrant
he
had
obtained
against
her
and
asked
if
she
had
anything
to
offer
why
the
constable
should
not
do
his
duty
inexpressible
were
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
the
defendant
when
she
found
herself
thus
entrapped
and
reflected
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
being
detected
of
felony
for
she
at
once
concluded
that
the
snare
was
laid
for
her
and
knew
that
the
officer
of
justice
would
certainly
find
the
unlucky
watch
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
scrutoire
tortured
with
these
suggestions
afraid
of
public
disgrace
and
dreading
the
consequence
of
legal
conviction
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
injured
fathom
and
after
having
imputed
her
crime
to
the
temptations
of
necessity
implored
his
compassion
promised
to
restore
the
watch
and
everything
she
had
taken
and
begged
he
would
dismiss
the
constable
that
her
reputation
might
not
suffer
in
the
eye
of
the
world
ferdinand
with
a
severity
of
countenance
purposely
assumed
observed
that
were
she
really
indigent
he
had
charity
enough
to
forgive
what
she
had
done
but
as
he
knew
her
circumstances
were
opulent
he
looked
upon
this
excuse
as
an
aggravation
of
her
guilt
which
was
certainly
the
effect
of
a
vicious
inclination
and
he
was
therefore
determined
to
prosecute
her
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
as
an
example
and
terror
to
others
who
might
be
infected
with
the
same
evil
disposition
finding
him
deaf
to
all
her
tears
and
entreaties
she
changed
her
note
and
offered
him
one
hundred
guineas
if
he
would
compromise
the
affair
and
drop
the
prosecution
so
as
that
her
character
should
sustain
no
damage
after
much
argumentation
he
consented
to
accept
of
double
the
sum
which
being
instantly
paid
in
east
india
bonds
doctor
fathom
told
the
constable
that
the
watch
was
found
and
for
once
her
reputation
was
patched
up
this
seasonable
supply
enabled
our
hero
to
stand
trial
with
his
adversary
who
was
nonsuited
and
also
to
mend
his
external
appearance
which
of
late
had
not
been
extremely
magnificent
soon
after
this
gleam
of
good
fortune
a
tradesman
to
whom
he
was
considerably
indebted
seeing
no
other
probable
means
to
recover
his
money
introduced
fathom
to
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
widow
who
lodged
at
his
house
and
was
said
to
be
in
possession
of
a
considerable
fortune
considering
the
steps
that
were
taken
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
him
to
miscarry
in
his
addresses
the
lady
had
been
bred
in
the
country
was
unacquainted
with
the
world
and
of
a
very
sanguine
disposition
which
her
short
trial
of
matrimony
had
not
served
to
cool
our
adventurer
was
instructed
to
call
at
the
tradesman
house
as
if
by
accident
at
an
appointed
time
when
the
widow
was
drinking
tea
with
her
landlady
on
these
occasions
he
always
behaved
to
admiration
she
liked
his
person
and
praised
his
politeness
and
good
sense
his
confederates
extolled
him
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
taste
and
they
likewise
represented
him
as
a
person
on
the
eve
of
eclipsing
all
his
competitors
in
physic
an
acquaintance
and
intimacy
soon
ensued
nor
was
he
restricted
in
point
of
opportunity
in
a
word
he
succeeded
in
his
endeavours
and
one
evening
on
pretence
of
attending
her
to
the
play
he
accompanied
her
to
the
fleet
where
they
were
married
in
presence
of
the
tradesman
and
his
wife
who
were
of
the
party
this
grand
affair
being
accomplished
to
his
satisfaction
he
next
day
visited
her
brother
who
was
a
counsellor
of
the
temple
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
step
his
sister
had
taken
and
though
the
lawyer
was
not
a
little
mortified
to
find
that
she
had
made
such
a
clandestine
match
he
behaved
civilly
to
his
new
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
wife
fortune
consisted
of
a
jointure
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
fifteen
hundred
pounds
bequeathed
to
her
during
her
widowhood
by
her
own
father
who
had
taken
the
precaution
of
settling
it
in
the
hands
of
trustees
in
such
a
manner
as
that
any
husband
she
might
afterwards
espouse
should
be
restricted
from
encroaching
upon
the
capital
which
was
reserved
for
the
benefit
of
her
heirs
this
intimation
was
far
from
being
agreeable
to
our
hero
who
had
been
informed
that
this
sum
was
absolutely
at
the
lady
disposal
and
had
actually
destined
the
greatest
part
of
it
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
for
defraying
the
expense
of
furnishing
an
elegant
house
and
setting
up
a
new
equipage
notwithstanding
this
disappointment
he
resolved
to
carry
on
his
plan
upon
the
credit
of
his
marriage
which
was
published
in
a
very
pompous
article
of
the
newspapers
a
chariot
was
bespoke
a
ready
furnished
house
immediately
taken
and
doctor
fathom
began
to
reappear
in
all
his
former
splendour
his
good
friend
the
empiric
alarmed
at
this
event
which
not
only
raised
our
adventurer
into
the
sphere
of
a
dangerous
rival
but
also
furnished
him
with
means
to
revenge
the
ill
office
he
had
sustained
at
his
hands
on
the
adventure
of
the
former
match
for
by
this
time
fathom
had
given
him
some
hints
importing
that
he
was
not
ignorant
of
his
treacherous
behaviour
roused
i
say
by
these
considerations
he
employed
one
of
his
emissaries
who
had
some
knowledge
of
fathom
to
prejudice
him
against
our
adventurer
whom
he
represented
as
a
needy
sharper
not
only
overwhelmed
with
debt
and
disgrace
but
likewise
previously
married
to
a
poor
woman
who
was
prevented
by
nothing
but
want
from
seeking
redress
at
law
to
confirm
these
assertions
he
gave
him
a
detail
of
fathom
encumbrances
which
he
had
learned
for
the
purpose
and
even
brought
the
counsellor
into
company
with
the
person
who
had
lived
with
our
hero
before
marriage
and
who
was
so
much
incensed
at
her
abrupt
dismission
that
she
did
not
scruple
to
corroborate
these
allegations
of
the
informer
the
lawyer
startled
at
this
intelligence
set
on
foot
a
minute
inquiry
into
the
life
and
conversation
of
the
doctor
which
turned
out
so
little
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
and
circumstances
that
he
resolved
if
possible
to
disunite
him
from
his
family
and
as
a
previous
step
repeated
to
his
sister
all
that
he
had
heard
to
the
prejudice
of
her
husband
not
forgetting
to
produce
the
evidence
of
his
mistress
who
laid
claim
to
him
by
a
prior
title
which
she
pretended
could
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
the
clergyman
who
joined
them
such
an
explanation
could
not
fail
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
injured
wife
who
at
the
very
first
opportunity
giving
a
loose
to
the
impetuosity
of
her
temper
upbraided
our
hero
with
the
most
bitter
invectives
for
his
perfidious
dealing
ferdinand
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
which
he
had
not
always
to
plead
far
from
attempting
to
soothe
her
indignation
assumed
the
authority
and
prerogative
of
a
husband
and
sharply
reprehended
her
for
her
credulity
and
indecent
warmth
this
rebuke
instead
of
silencing
gave
new
spirit
and
volubility
to
her
reproaches
in
the
course
of
which
she
plainly
taxed
him
with
want
of
honesty
and
affection
and
said
that
though
his
pretence
was
love
his
aim
was
no
other
than
a
base
design
upon
her
fortune
fathom
stung
with
these
accusations
which
he
really
did
not
deserve
replied
with
uncommon
heat
and
charged
her
in
his
turn
with
want
of
sincerity
and
candour
in
the
false
account
she
had
given
of
that
same
fortune
before
marriage
he
even
magnified
his
own
condescension
in
surrendering
his
liberty
to
a
woman
who
had
so
little
to
recommend
her
to
the
addresses
of
the
other
sex
a
reflection
which
provoked
this
mild
creature
to
such
a
degree
of
animosity
that
forgetting
her
duty
and
allegiance
she
lent
him
a
box
on
the
ear
with
such
energy
as
made
his
eyes
water
and
he
for
the
honour
of
manhood
and
sovereignty
having
washed
her
face
with
a
dish
of
tea
withdrew
abruptly
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
had
not
long
remained
when
his
passion
subsided
and
he
then
saw
the
expediency
of
an
immediate
reconciliation
which
he
resolved
to
purchase
even
at
the
expense
of
a
submission
it
was
pity
that
such
a
salutary
resolution
had
not
been
sooner
taken
for
when
he
returned
to
his
own
house
he
understood
that
fathom
had
gone
abroad
in
a
and
upon
examining
her
apartment
in
lieu
of
her
clothes
and
trinkets
which
she
had
removed
with
admirable
dexterity
and
despatch
he
found
this
billet
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
bureau
sir
being
convinced
that
you
are
a
cheat
and
an
impostor
i
have
withdrawn
myself
from
your
cruelty
and
machinations
with
a
view
to
solicit
the
protection
of
the
law
and
i
doubt
not
but
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
prove
that
you
have
no
just
title
to
or
demand
upon
the
person
or
effects
of
the
unfortunate
sarah
the
time
had
been
when
fathom
would
have
allowed
muddy
to
refine
at
her
leisure
and
blessed
god
for
his
happy
deliverance
but
at
present
the
case
was
quite
altered
smarting
as
he
was
from
the
expense
of
lawsuits
he
dreaded
a
prosecution
for
bigamy
which
though
he
had
justice
on
his
side
he
knew
he
could
not
of
himself
support
besides
all
his
other
schemes
of
life
were
frustrated
by
this
unlucky
elopement
he
therefore
speedily
determined
to
anticipate
as
much
as
in
him
lay
the
malice
of
his
enemies
and
to
obtain
without
delay
authentic
documents
of
his
marriage
with
this
view
he
hastened
to
the
house
of
the
tradesman
who
with
his
wife
had
been
witness
to
the
ceremony
and
consummation
and
in
order
to
interest
them
the
more
warmly
in
his
cause
made
a
pathetic
recital
of
this
unhappy
breach
in
which
he
had
suffered
such
injury
and
insult
but
all
his
rhetoric
would
not
avail
muddy
had
been
beforehand
with
him
and
had
proved
the
better
orator
of
the
two
for
she
had
assailed
this
honest
couple
with
such
tropes
and
figures
of
eloquence
as
were
altogether
irresistible
nevertheless
they
heard
our
hero
to
an
end
with
great
patience
then
the
wife
who
was
the
common
mouth
upon
all
such
occasions
contracting
her
features
into
a
very
formal
disposition
i
assure
you
said
she
doctor
fathom
my
husband
and
i
have
been
in
a
very
great
terrification
and
numplush
to
hear
such
bad
things
of
a
person
whom
as
one
may
say
we
thought
a
worthy
gentleman
and
were
ready
to
serve
at
all
times
by
day
and
by
night
as
the
saying
is
and
besides
for
all
that
you
know
and
god
knows
as
we
are
dustrious
people
and
work
hard
for
what
we
get
and
we
have
served
gentlemen
to
our
own
harm
whereby
my
husband
was
last
tuesday
served
with
a
siserary
being
that
he
was
bound
for
an
officer
that
ran
away
and
i
said
to
my
husband
timothy
says
i
is
a
very
hard
thing
for
one
to
ruin
one
self
for
stranger
people
there
doctor
fathom
says
i
his
account
comes
to
pounds
seven
shillings
and
fourpence
halfpenny
and
you
know
doctor
that
was
before
your
last
bill
began
but
howsomever
little
did
i
think
as
how
a
gentleman
of
your
learning
would
go
to
deceive
a
poor
gentlewoman
when
you
had
another
wife
in
vain
did
our
adventurer
endeavour
to
vindicate
himself
from
this
aspersion
the
good
woman
like
a
great
many
modern
disputants
proceeded
with
her
declamation
without
seeming
to
hear
what
was
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
the
husband
was
altogether
neutral
at
length
ferdinand
finding
all
his
protestations
ineffectual
well
said
he
though
you
are
resolved
i
see
to
discredit
all
that
i
can
say
in
opposition
to
that
scandalous
slander
of
which
i
can
easily
acquit
myself
in
a
court
of
justice
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
grant
me
a
certificate
signifying
that
you
were
present
at
the
ceremony
of
my
marriage
with
this
unhappy
you
shall
excuse
us
replied
the
female
orator
people
can
not
be
too
wary
in
signing
their
names
in
this
wicked
world
many
a
one
has
been
brought
to
ruination
by
signing
his
name
and
my
husband
shall
not
with
my
goodwill
draw
himself
into
such
a
fathom
alarmed
at
this
refusal
earnestly
argued
against
the
inhumanity
and
injustice
of
it
appealing
to
their
own
consciences
for
the
reasonableness
of
his
proposal
but
from
the
evasive
answers
of
the
wife
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
long
before
the
time
of
trial
they
would
take
care
to
have
forgotten
the
whole
transaction
though
he
was
equally
confounded
and
incensed
at
this
instance
of
their
perfidy
he
durst
not
manifest
his
indignation
conscious
of
the
advantage
they
had
over
him
in
divers
respects
but
repaired
without
loss
of
time
to
the
lodging
of
the
clergyman
who
had
noosed
him
resolved
to
consult
his
register
and
secure
his
evidence
here
too
his
evil
genius
had
got
the
start
of
him
for
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
not
only
could
not
recollect
his
features
or
find
his
name
in
the
register
but
when
importuned
by
his
pressing
remonstrances
took
umbrage
at
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
and
threatened
if
he
would
not
immediately
take
himself
away
to
raise
the
posse
of
the
fleet
for
the
safety
of
his
own
person
rather
than
put
the
pastor
to
the
trouble
of
alarming
his
flock
he
retreated
with
a
heavy
heart
and
went
in
quest
of
his
mistress
whom
he
had
dismissed
at
his
marriage
in
hopes
of
effecting
a
reconciliation
and
preventing
her
from
joining
in
the
conspiracy
against
him
but
alas
he
met
with
such
a
reception
as
he
had
reason
to
expect
from
a
slighted
woman
who
had
never
felt
any
real
attachment
for
his
person
she
did
not
upbraid
him
with
his
cruelty
in
leaving
her
as
a
mistress
but
with
a
species
of
effrontery
never
enough
to
be
admired
reproached
him
with
his
villany
in
abandoning
her
who
was
his
true
and
lawful
wife
to
go
and
ruin
a
poor
gentlewoman
by
whose
fortune
he
had
been
allured
when
he
attempted
to
expostulate
with
this
virago
upon
the
barbarity
of
this
assertion
she
very
prudently
declined
engaging
in
private
conversation
with
such
an
artful
and
wicked
man
and
calling
up
the
people
of
the
house
insisted
upon
his
being
conducted
to
the
door
chapter
in
which
his
fortune
is
effectually
strangled
the
last
resource
and
that
upon
which
he
least
depended
was
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
old
friend
the
empiric
with
whom
he
still
maintained
a
slight
correspondence
and
to
whose
house
he
steered
his
course
in
great
perplexity
and
tribulation
that
gentleman
instead
of
consoling
him
with
assurances
of
friendship
and
protection
faithfully
recapitulated
all
the
instances
of
his
indiscretion
and
misconduct
taxed
him
with
want
of
sincerity
in
the
west
india
affair
as
well
as
with
want
of
honesty
in
this
last
marriage
while
his
former
wife
was
alive
and
finally
reminded
him
of
his
notes
which
he
desired
might
be
immediately
taken
up
as
he
the
quack
had
present
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money
ferdinand
seeing
it
would
be
impracticable
to
derive
any
succour
from
this
quarter
sneaked
homewards
in
order
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
own
thoughts
and
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
when
he
entered
his
apartment
was
a
letter
from
the
tradesman
with
his
account
inclosed
amounting
to
pounds
which
the
writer
desired
might
be
paid
without
delay
before
he
had
time
to
peruse
the
articles
he
received
a
summons
in
consequence
of
a
bill
of
indictment
for
bigamy
found
against
him
in
hicks
hall
by
sarah
muddy
widow
and
while
he
was
revolving
measures
to
avert
these
storms
another
billet
arrived
from
a
certain
attorney
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
orders
from
doctor
buffalo
the
quack
to
sue
him
for
the
payment
of
several
notes
unless
he
would
take
them
up
in
three
days
from
the
date
of
this
letter
such
a
concurrence
of
sinister
events
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
all
his
fortitude
was
insufficient
to
bear
him
up
against
this
torrent
of
misfortunes
his
resources
were
all
dried
up
his
invention
failed
and
his
reflection
began
to
take
a
new
turn
to
what
purpose
said
he
to
himself
have
i
deserted
the
paths
of
integrity
and
truth
and
exhausted
a
fruitful
imagination
in
contriving
schemes
to
betray
my
if
instead
of
acquiring
a
splendid
fortune
which
was
my
aim
i
have
suffered
such
a
series
of
mortifications
and
at
last
brought
myself
to
the
brink
of
inevitable
destruction
by
a
virtuous
exertion
of
those
talents
i
inherit
from
nature
and
education
i
might
long
before
this
time
have
rendered
myself
independent
and
perhaps
conspicuous
in
life
i
might
have
grown
up
like
a
young
oak
which
being
firmly
rooted
in
its
kindred
soil
gradually
raises
up
its
lofty
head
expands
its
leafy
arms
projects
a
noble
shade
and
towers
the
glory
of
the
plain
i
should
have
paid
the
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
benefactors
and
made
their
hearts
sing
with
joy
for
the
happy
effects
of
their
benevolence
i
should
have
been
a
bulwark
to
my
friends
a
shelter
to
my
neighbours
in
distress
i
should
have
run
the
race
of
honour
seen
my
fame
diffused
like
a
odour
and
felt
the
ineffable
pleasure
of
doing
good
whereas
i
am
after
a
vicissitude
of
disappointments
dangers
and
fatigues
reduced
to
misery
and
shame
aggravated
by
a
conscience
loaded
with
treachery
and
guilt
i
have
abused
the
confidence
and
generosity
of
my
patron
i
have
defrauded
his
family
under
the
mask
of
sincerity
and
attachment
i
have
taken
the
most
cruel
and
base
advantages
of
virtue
in
distress
i
have
seduced
unsuspecting
innocence
to
ruin
and
despair
i
have
violated
the
most
sacred
trust
reposed
in
me
by
my
friend
and
benefactor
i
have
betrayed
his
love
torn
his
noble
heart
asunder
by
means
of
the
most
perfidious
slander
and
false
insinuations
and
finally
brought
to
an
untimely
grave
the
fairest
pattern
of
human
beauty
and
perfection
shall
the
author
of
these
crimes
pass
with
impunity
shall
he
hope
to
prosper
in
the
midst
of
such
enormous
guilt
it
were
an
imputation
upon
providence
to
suppose
it
ah
no
i
begin
to
feel
myself
overtaken
by
the
eternal
justice
of
heaven
i
totter
on
the
edge
of
wretchedness
and
woe
without
one
friendly
hand
to
save
me
from
the
terrible
abyss
these
reflections
which
perhaps
the
misery
of
his
would
never
have
inspired
had
he
himself
remained
without
the
verge
of
misfortune
were
now
produced
from
the
sensation
of
his
own
calamities
and
for
the
first
time
his
cheeks
were
bedewed
with
the
drops
of
penitence
and
sorrow
contraries
saith
plato
are
productive
of
each
reformation
is
oftentimes
generated
from
unsuccessful
vice
and
our
adventurer
was
at
this
juncture
very
well
disposed
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
in
consequence
of
those
salutary
suggestions
though
he
was
far
from
being
cured
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
on
the
contrary
all
the
faculties
of
his
soul
were
so
well
adapted
and
had
been
so
long
habituated
to
deceit
that
in
order
to
extricate
himself
from
the
evils
that
environed
him
he
would
not
in
all
probability
have
scrupled
to
practise
it
upon
his
own
father
had
a
convenient
opportunity
occurred
be
that
as
it
may
he
certainly
after
a
tedious
and
fruitless
exercise
of
his
invention
resolved
to
effect
a
clandestine
retreat
from
that
confederacy
of
enemies
which
he
could
not
withstand
and
once
more
join
his
fortune
to
that
of
renaldo
whom
he
proposed
to
serve
for
the
future
with
fidelity
and
affection
thereby
endeavouring
to
atone
for
the
treachery
of
his
former
conduct
thus
determined
he
packed
up
his
necessaries
in
a
portmanteau
attempted
to
amuse
his
creditors
with
promises
of
speedy
payment
and
venturing
to
come
forth
in
the
dark
took
a
place
in
the
canterbury
after
having
converted
his
superfluities
into
ready
money
these
steps
were
not
taken
with
such
privacy
as
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
his
adversaries
for
although
he
had
been
cautious
enough
to
transport
himself
and
his
baggage
to
the
inn
on
sunday
evening
and
never
doubted
that
the
vehicle
which
set
out
at
four
on
monday
morning
would
convey
him
out
of
the
reach
of
his
creditors
before
they
could
possibly
obtain
a
writ
for
securing
his
person
they
had
actually
taken
such
precautions
as
frustrated
all
his
finesse
and
the
coach
being
stopped
in
the
borough
of
southwark
doctor
fathom
was
seized
by
virtue
of
a
warrant
obtained
on
a
criminal
indictment
and
was
forthwith
conducted
to
the
prison
of
the
bench
yet
not
before
he
had
by
his
pathetic
remonstrances
excited
the
compassion
and
even
drawn
tears
from
the
eyes
of
his
he
no
sooner
recollected
himself
from
the
shock
which
must
have
been
occasioned
by
this
sinister
incident
than
he
despatched
a
letter
to
his
the
counsellor
requesting
an
immediate
conference
in
which
he
promised
to
make
such
a
proposal
as
would
save
him
all
the
expense
of
a
lawsuit
and
trial
and
at
the
same
time
effectually
answer
all
the
purposes
of
both
he
was
accordingly
favoured
with
a
visit
from
the
lawyer
to
whom
after
the
most
solemn
protestations
of
his
own
innocence
he
declared
that
finding
himself
unable
to
wage
war
against
such
powerful
antagonists
he
had
resolved
even
to
abandon
his
indubitable
right
and
retire
into
another
country
in
order
to
screen
himself
from
persecution
and
remove
all
cause
of
disquiet
from
the
prosecutrix
when
he
was
unfortunately
prevented
by
the
warrant
which
had
been
executed
against
him
he
said
he
was
still
willing
for
the
sake
of
his
liberty
to
sign
a
formal
renunciation
of
his
pretensions
to
fathom
and
her
fortune
provided
the
deeds
could
be
executed
and
the
warrant
withdrawn
before
he
should
be
detained
by
his
other
creditors
and
lastly
he
conjured
the
barrister
to
spare
himself
the
guilt
and
the
charge
of
suborning
evidence
for
the
destruction
of
an
unhappy
man
whose
misfortune
was
his
only
fault
the
lawyer
felt
the
force
of
his
expostulations
and
though
he
would
by
no
means
suppose
him
innocent
of
the
charge
of
bigamy
yet
under
the
pretext
of
humanity
and
commiseration
he
undertook
to
persuade
his
sister
to
accept
of
a
proper
release
which
he
observed
would
not
be
binding
if
executed
during
the
confinement
of
fathom
he
therefore
took
his
leave
in
order
to
prepare
the
papers
withdraw
the
action
and
take
such
other
measures
as
would
hinder
the
prisoner
from
giving
him
the
slip
next
day
he
returned
with
an
order
to
release
our
hero
who
being
formally
discharged
was
conducted
by
the
lawyer
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
releases
were
exchanged
and
everything
concluded
with
amity
and
concord
this
business
being
happily
transacted
fathom
stept
into
a
with
his
baggage
and
was
followed
by
a
bailiff
who
told
him
with
great
composure
that
he
was
again
a
prisoner
at
the
suit
of
doctor
buffalo
and
desired
the
coachman
to
reconduct
him
to
the
lodging
he
had
so
lately
discharged
fathom
whose
fortitude
had
been
hitherto
of
the
pagan
temper
was
now
fain
to
reinforce
it
with
the
philosophy
of
christian
resignation
though
he
had
not
as
yet
arrived
to
such
a
pitch
of
as
to
forgive
the
counsellor
to
whose
double
dealing
he
imputed
this
new
calamity
after
having
received
the
compliments
of
the
jailer
on
his
recommitment
he
took
pen
ink
and
paper
and
composed
an
artful
and
affecting
epistle
to
the
empiric
imploring
his
mercy
flattering
his
weakness
and
demonstrating
the
bad
policy
of
cooping
up
an
unhappy
man
in
a
jail
where
he
could
never
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
justice
to
his
creditors
nor
did
he
forget
to
declare
his
intention
of
retiring
into
another
country
where
he
might
have
some
chance
of
earning
a
subsistence
which
he
had
so
long
toiled
for
to
no
purpose
in
england
this
last
declaration
he
made
in
consequence
of
the
jealous
disposition
of
the
quack
who
he
knew
had
long
looked
upon
him
in
the
odious
light
of
an
interloping
rival
however
he
reaped
no
benefit
from
this
supplication
which
served
only
to
gratify
the
pride
of
buffalo
who
produced
the
extravagant
encomiums
which
fathom
had
bestowed
upon
him
as
so
many
testimonials
of
his
foe
bearing
witness
to
his
virtue
chapter
fathom
being
safely
housed
the
reader
is
entertained
with
a
retrospect
but
now
it
is
high
time
to
leave
our
adventurer
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
and
remorse
in
this
solitary
mansion
that
we
may
trace
renaldo
in
the
several
steps
he
took
to
assert
his
right
and
do
justice
to
his
family
never
man
indulged
a
more
melancholy
train
of
ideas
than
that
which
accompanied
him
in
his
journey
to
the
imperial
court
for
notwithstanding
the
manifold
reasons
he
had
to
expect
a
happy
issue
to
his
aim
his
imagination
was
incessantly
infected
with
something
that
chilled
his
nerves
and
saddened
his
heart
recurring
with
quick
succession
like
the
unwearied
wave
that
beats
upon
the
bleak
inhospitable
greenland
shore
this
the
reader
will
easily
suppose
was
no
other
than
the
remembrance
of
the
forlorn
monimia
whose
image
appeared
to
his
fancy
in
different
attitudes
according
to
the
prevalence
of
the
passions
which
raged
in
his
bosom
sometimes
he
viewed
her
in
the
light
of
apostasy
and
then
his
soul
was
maddened
with
indignation
and
despair
but
these
transitory
blasts
were
not
able
to
efface
the
impressions
she
had
formerly
made
upon
his
heart
impressions
which
he
had
so
often
and
so
long
contemplated
with
inconceivable
rapture
these
pictures
still
remained
representing
her
fair
as
the
most
perfect
idea
of
beauty
soft
and
tender
as
an
angel
of
mercy
and
compassion
warmed
with
every
virtue
of
the
heart
and
adorned
with
every
accomplishment
of
human
nature
yet
the
alarming
contrast
came
still
in
the
rear
of
this
recollection
so
that
his
soul
was
by
turns
agitated
by
the
tempests
of
horror
and
overwhelmed
by
the
floods
of
grief
he
recalled
the
moment
on
which
he
first
beheld
her
with
that
pleasing
regret
which
attends
the
memory
of
a
dear
deceased
friend
then
he
bitterly
cursed
it
as
the
source
of
all
his
misfortunes
and
affliction
he
thanked
heaven
for
having
blessed
him
with
a
friend
to
detect
her
perfidy
and
ingratitude
and
then
ardently
wished
he
had
still
continued
under
the
influence
of
her
delusion
in
a
word
the
loneliness
of
his
situation
aggravated
every
horror
of
his
reflection
for
as
he
found
himself
without
company
his
imagination
was
never
solicited
or
his
attention
diverted
from
these
subjects
of
woe
and
he
travelled
to
brussels
in
a
reverie
fraught
with
such
torments
as
must
have
entirely
wrecked
his
reason
had
not
providence
interposed
in
his
behalf
he
was
by
his
postillion
conducted
to
one
of
the
best
inns
of
the
place
where
he
understood
the
cloth
was
already
laid
for
supper
and
as
the
ordinary
is
open
to
strangers
in
all
these
houses
of
entertainment
he
introduced
himself
into
the
company
with
a
view
to
alleviate
in
some
measure
his
sorrow
and
chagrin
by
the
conversation
of
his
yet
he
was
so
ill
prepared
to
obtain
the
relief
which
he
courted
that
he
entered
the
apartment
and
sat
down
to
table
without
distinguishing
either
the
number
or
countenances
of
those
who
were
present
though
he
himself
did
not
long
remain
so
unregarded
his
mien
and
deportment
produced
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
the
air
of
affliction
so
remarkable
in
his
visage
did
not
fail
to
attract
their
sympathy
and
observation
among
the
rest
was
an
irish
officer
in
the
austrian
service
who
having
eyed
renaldo
attentively
sir
said
he
rising
if
my
eyes
and
memory
do
not
deceive
me
you
are
the
count
de
melvil
with
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
serve
upon
the
rhine
during
the
last
the
youth
hearing
his
own
name
mentioned
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
at
once
recognising
the
other
to
be
a
gentleman
who
had
been
a
captain
in
his
father
regiment
ran
forwards
and
embraced
him
with
great
affection
this
was
in
divers
respects
a
fortunate
rencontre
for
young
melvil
as
the
officer
was
not
only
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
the
count
family
but
also
resolved
in
a
few
days
to
set
out
for
vienna
whither
he
promised
to
accompany
renaldo
as
soon
as
he
understood
his
route
lay
the
same
way
before
the
day
fixed
for
their
departure
arrived
this
gentleman
found
means
to
insinuate
himself
so
far
into
the
confidence
of
the
count
as
to
learn
the
cause
of
that
distress
which
he
had
observed
in
his
features
at
their
first
meeting
and
being
a
gentleman
of
uncommon
vivacity
as
well
as
sincerely
attached
to
the
family
of
melvil
to
which
he
had
owed
his
promotion
he
exerted
all
his
and
good
sense
in
amusing
the
fancy
and
reasoning
down
the
mortification
of
the
afflicted
hungarian
he
in
particular
endeavoured
to
wean
his
attention
from
the
lost
monimia
by
engaging
it
upon
his
domestic
affairs
and
upon
the
wrongs
of
his
mother
and
sister
who
he
gave
him
to
understand
were
languishing
under
the
tyranny
of
his
this
was
a
note
that
effectually
roused
him
from
the
lethargy
of
his
sorrow
and
the
desire
of
taking
vengeance
on
the
oppressor
who
had
ruined
his
fortune
and
made
his
nearest
relations
miserable
so
entirely
engrossed
his
thoughts
as
to
leave
no
room
for
other
considerations
during
their
journey
to
austria
major
farrel
that
was
the
name
of
his
informed
him
of
many
circumstances
touching
his
father
house
to
which
himself
was
an
utter
stranger
the
conduct
of
your
mother
said
he
in
marrying
count
trebasi
was
not
at
all
agreeable
either
to
the
friends
of
the
count
de
melvil
or
to
her
own
relations
who
knew
her
second
husband
to
be
a
man
of
a
violent
temper
and
rapacious
disposition
which
the
nature
of
his
education
and
employment
had
served
rather
to
inflame
than
allay
for
you
well
know
he
was
a
partisan
during
the
whole
course
of
the
late
war
they
were
moreover
equally
surprised
and
chagrined
when
they
found
she
took
no
step
to
prevent
his
seizing
upon
that
inheritance
which
of
right
belonged
to
you
and
which
by
the
laws
of
hungary
is
unalienable
from
the
heir
of
blood
nevertheless
they
are
now
fully
convinced
that
she
hath
more
than
sufficiently
atoned
for
her
indiscretion
by
the
barbarity
of
her
husband
who
hath
not
only
secluded
her
from
all
communication
with
her
friends
and
acquaintance
but
even
confined
her
to
the
west
tower
of
your
father
house
where
she
is
said
to
be
kept
close
prisoner
and
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
inconvenience
and
mortification
this
severity
she
is
believed
to
have
incurred
in
consequence
of
having
expostulated
to
him
upon
his
unjust
behaviour
to
you
and
mademoiselle
whom
he
hath
actually
shut
up
in
some
convent
in
vienna
which
your
relations
have
not
as
yet
been
able
to
discover
but
the
memory
of
your
noble
father
is
so
dear
to
all
those
who
were
favoured
with
his
friendship
and
the
sufferings
of
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
have
raised
such
a
spirit
of
resentment
against
her
cruel
jailor
that
nothing
is
wanted
but
your
presence
to
begin
the
prosecution
and
give
a
sanction
to
the
measures
of
your
friends
which
will
in
a
little
time
restore
your
family
to
the
fruition
of
its
rights
and
fortune
for
my
own
part
my
dear
count
i
consider
myself
as
one
wholly
indebted
to
your
house
for
the
rank
and
expectation
i
now
enjoy
and
my
finances
interest
and
person
such
as
they
are
i
dedicate
to
your
renaldo
was
not
slow
in
making
his
acknowledgments
to
this
generous
hibernian
whom
he
informed
of
his
scheme
recounting
to
him
his
uncommon
transaction
with
the
benevolent
jew
and
communicating
the
letters
of
recommendation
he
had
received
by
his
means
to
some
of
the
first
noblemen
at
the
imperial
court
meanwhile
he
burned
with
impatience
to
chastise
count
trebasi
for
his
perfidious
conduct
to
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
would
have
taken
the
road
to
presburg
without
touching
at
vienna
in
order
to
call
him
to
a
severe
account
had
not
he
been
strenuously
opposed
by
major
farrel
who
represented
the
imprudence
of
taking
such
a
step
before
he
had
secured
a
proper
protection
from
the
consequences
with
which
it
might
be
attended
it
is
not
said
he
your
own
life
and
fortune
only
which
depend
upon
your
behaviour
in
this
emergency
but
also
the
quiet
and
happiness
of
those
who
are
most
dear
to
your
affection
not
you
alone
but
likewise
your
mother
and
sister
would
infallibly
suffer
by
your
temerity
and
precipitation
first
of
all
deliver
your
credentials
at
court
and
let
us
join
our
endeavours
to
raise
an
interest
strong
enough
to
counterbalance
that
of
trebasi
if
we
succeed
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
having
recourse
to
personal
measures
he
will
be
compelled
to
yield
up
your
inheritance
which
he
unjustly
detains
and
to
restore
your
sister
to
your
arms
and
if
he
afterwards
refuses
to
do
justice
to
the
countess
you
will
always
have
it
in
your
power
to
evince
yourself
the
son
of
the
brave
count
de
these
just
and
salutary
representations
had
a
due
effect
upon
renaldo
who
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
capital
of
austria
than
he
waited
upon
a
certain
prince
of
distinction
to
whose
patronage
he
was
commended
and
from
whom
he
met
with
a
very
cordial
reception
not
only
on
account
of
his
credentials
but
also
for
the
sake
of
his
father
who
was
well
known
to
his
highness
he
heard
his
complaints
with
great
patience
and
affability
assured
him
of
his
assistance
and
protection
and
even
undertook
to
introduce
him
to
the
who
would
not
suffer
the
weakest
of
her
subjects
to
be
oppressed
much
less
disregard
the
cause
of
an
injured
young
nobleman
who
by
his
own
services
and
those
of
his
family
was
peculiarly
entitled
to
her
favour
nor
was
he
the
only
person
whose
countenance
and
patronage
melvil
solicited
upon
this
occasion
he
visited
all
the
friends
of
his
father
and
all
his
mother
relations
who
were
easily
interested
in
his
behalf
while
major
farrel
contributed
all
his
efforts
in
strengthening
the
association
so
that
a
lawsuit
was
immediately
commenced
against
count
trebasi
who
on
his
side
was
not
idle
but
prepared
with
incredible
industry
for
the
assault
resolving
to
maintain
with
his
whole
power
the
acquisition
he
had
made
the
laws
of
hungary
like
those
of
some
other
countries
i
could
name
afford
so
many
subterfuges
for
the
purposes
of
perfidy
and
fraud
that
it
is
no
wonder
our
youth
began
to
complain
of
the
slow
progress
of
his
affair
especially
as
he
glowed
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
redressing
the
grievances
of
his
parent
and
sister
whose
sufferings
he
did
not
doubt
were
doubled
since
the
institution
of
his
process
against
their
tormentor
he
imparted
his
sentiments
on
this
head
to
his
friend
and
as
his
apprehensions
every
moment
increased
plainly
told
him
he
could
no
longer
live
without
making
some
effort
to
see
those
with
whom
he
was
so
nearly
connected
in
point
of
blood
and
affection
he
therefore
resolved
to
repair
immediately
to
presburg
and
according
to
the
intelligence
he
should
procure
essay
to
see
and
converse
with
his
mother
though
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
chapter
renaldo
abridges
the
proceedings
at
law
and
approves
himself
the
son
of
his
father
the
major
finding
him
determined
insisted
upon
attending
him
in
this
expedition
and
they
set
out
together
for
presburg
where
they
privately
arrived
in
the
dark
resolving
to
keep
themselves
concealed
at
the
house
of
a
friend
until
they
should
have
formed
some
plan
for
their
future
operations
here
they
were
informed
that
count
trebasi
castle
was
altogether
inaccessible
that
all
the
servants
who
were
supposed
to
have
the
least
veneration
or
compassion
for
the
countess
were
dismissed
and
that
since
renaldo
was
known
to
be
in
germany
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
that
cruel
husband
was
redoubled
to
such
a
degree
that
nobody
knew
whether
his
unfortunate
lady
was
actually
alive
or
dead
farrel
perceiving
melvil
exceedingly
affected
with
this
intimation
and
hearing
him
declare
that
he
would
never
quit
presburg
until
he
should
have
entered
the
house
and
removed
his
doubts
on
that
interesting
subject
not
only
argued
with
great
vehemence
against
such
an
attempt
as
equally
dangerous
and
indiscreet
but
solemnly
swore
he
would
prevent
his
purpose
by
discovering
his
design
to
the
family
unless
he
would
promise
to
listen
to
a
more
moderate
and
feasible
expedient
he
then
proposed
that
he
himself
should
appear
in
the
equipage
of
one
of
the
travelling
savoyards
who
stroll
about
europe
amusing
ignorant
people
with
the
effects
of
a
magic
lanthorn
and
in
that
disguise
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance
from
the
servants
of
trebasi
among
whom
he
might
make
such
inquiries
as
would
deliver
melvil
from
his
present
uneasy
suspense
this
proposal
was
embraced
though
reluctantly
by
renaldo
who
was
unwilling
to
expose
his
friend
to
the
least
danger
or
disgrace
and
the
major
being
next
day
provided
with
the
habit
and
implements
of
his
new
profession
together
with
a
ragged
attendant
who
preceded
him
extorting
music
from
a
paltry
viol
approached
the
castle
gate
and
proclaimed
his
show
so
naturally
in
a
yell
partaking
of
the
scream
of
savoy
and
the
howl
of
ireland
that
one
would
have
imagined
he
had
been
conductor
to
madam
catherina
from
his
cradle
so
far
his
stratagem
succeeded
he
had
not
long
stood
in
waiting
before
he
was
invited
into
the
where
the
servants
formed
a
ring
and
danced
to
the
efforts
of
his
companion
skill
then
he
was
conducted
into
the
buttery
where
he
exhibited
his
figures
on
the
wall
and
his
princess
on
the
floor
and
while
they
regaled
him
in
this
manner
with
scraps
and
sour
wine
he
took
occasion
to
inquire
about
the
old
lady
and
her
daughter
before
whom
he
said
he
had
performed
in
his
last
peregrination
though
this
question
was
asked
with
all
that
air
of
simplicity
which
is
peculiar
to
these
people
one
of
the
domestics
took
the
alarm
being
infected
with
the
suspicions
of
his
master
and
plainly
taxed
the
major
with
being
a
spy
threatening
at
the
same
time
that
he
should
be
stripped
and
searched
this
would
have
been
a
very
dangerous
experiment
for
the
hibernian
who
had
actually
in
his
pocket
a
letter
to
the
countess
from
her
son
which
he
hoped
fortune
might
have
furnished
him
with
an
opportunity
to
deliver
when
he
therefore
found
himself
in
this
dilemma
he
was
not
at
all
easy
in
his
own
mind
however
instead
of
protesting
his
innocence
in
an
humble
and
beseeching
strain
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
charge
he
resolved
to
elude
the
suspicion
by
provoking
the
wrath
of
his
accuser
and
putting
on
the
air
of
vulgar
integrity
affronted
began
to
reproach
the
servant
in
very
insolent
terms
for
his
unfair
supposition
and
undressed
himself
in
a
moment
to
the
skin
threw
his
tattered
garments
in
the
face
of
his
adversary
telling
him
he
would
find
nothing
there
which
he
would
not
be
very
glad
to
part
with
at
the
same
time
raising
his
voice
he
in
the
gibberish
of
the
clan
he
represented
scolded
and
cursed
with
great
fluency
so
that
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
noise
the
valet
jealousy
like
a
smaller
fire
was
in
a
trice
swallowed
up
in
the
greater
flame
of
his
rage
enkindled
by
this
abrupt
address
in
consequence
of
which
farrel
was
kicked
out
at
the
gate
naked
as
he
was
to
the
waist
after
his
lanthorn
had
been
broke
to
pieces
on
his
head
and
there
he
was
joined
by
his
domestic
who
had
not
been
able
to
recover
his
apparel
and
effect
a
retreat
without
incurring
marks
of
the
same
sort
of
distinction
the
major
considering
the
risk
he
must
have
run
in
being
detected
thought
himself
cheaply
quit
for
this
moderate
discipline
though
he
was
really
concerned
for
his
friend
renaldo
who
understanding
the
particulars
of
the
adventure
determined
as
the
last
effort
to
ride
round
the
castle
in
the
open
day
on
pretence
of
taking
the
air
when
peradventure
the
countess
would
see
him
from
the
place
of
her
confinement
and
favour
him
with
some
mark
or
token
of
her
being
alive
though
his
companion
did
not
much
relish
this
plan
which
he
foresaw
would
expose
him
to
the
insults
of
trebasi
yet
as
he
could
not
contrive
a
better
he
acquiesced
in
renaldo
invention
with
the
proviso
that
he
would
defer
the
execution
of
it
until
his
should
be
absent
in
the
chase
which
was
a
diversion
he
every
day
enjoyed
accordingly
they
set
a
proper
watch
and
lay
concealed
until
they
were
informed
of
trebasi
having
gone
forth
when
they
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
having
made
a
small
excursion
in
the
adjoining
fields
they
drew
nearer
the
walls
and
at
an
easy
pace
had
twice
circled
them
when
farrel
descried
at
the
top
of
a
tower
a
white
handkerchief
waved
by
a
woman
hand
through
the
iron
bars
that
secured
the
window
this
signal
being
pointed
out
to
renaldo
his
heart
began
to
throb
with
great
violence
he
made
a
respectful
obeisance
towards
the
part
in
which
it
appeared
and
perceiving
the
hand
beckoning
him
to
approach
advanced
to
the
very
buttress
of
the
turret
upon
which
seeing
something
drop
he
alighted
with
great
expedition
and
took
up
a
picture
of
his
father
in
miniature
the
features
of
which
he
no
sooner
distinguished
than
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
pressed
the
little
image
to
his
lips
with
the
most
filial
fervour
then
conveying
it
to
his
bosom
looked
up
to
the
hand
which
waved
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
him
to
understand
it
was
high
time
to
retire
being
by
this
time
highly
persuaded
that
his
kind
monitor
was
no
other
than
the
countess
herself
he
pointed
to
his
heart
in
token
of
his
filial
affection
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
sword
to
denote
his
resolution
of
doing
her
justice
he
took
his
leave
with
another
profound
bow
and
suffered
himself
to
be
reconducted
to
his
lodging
every
circumstance
of
this
transaction
was
observed
by
the
servants
of
count
trebasi
who
immediately
despatched
a
messenger
to
their
lord
with
an
account
of
what
had
happened
alarmed
at
this
information
from
which
he
immediately
concluded
that
the
stranger
was
young
melvil
he
forthwith
quitted
the
chase
and
returning
to
the
castle
by
a
private
postern
ordered
his
horse
to
be
kept
ready
saddled
in
hope
that
his
would
repeat
the
visit
to
his
mother
this
precaution
would
have
been
to
no
purpose
had
renaldo
followed
the
advice
of
farrel
who
represented
the
danger
of
returning
to
a
place
where
the
alarm
was
undoubtedly
given
by
his
first
appearance
and
exhorted
him
to
return
to
vienna
for
the
prosecution
of
his
suit
now
that
he
was
satisfied
of
his
mother
being
alive
in
order
to
strengthen
this
admonition
he
bade
him
recollect
the
signal
for
withdrawing
which
was
doubtless
the
effect
of
maternal
concern
inspired
by
the
knowledge
of
the
count
vigilance
and
vindictive
disposition
notwithstanding
these
suggestions
melvil
persisted
in
his
resolution
of
appearing
once
more
below
the
tower
on
the
supposition
that
his
mother
in
expectation
of
his
return
had
prepared
a
billet
for
his
acceptance
from
which
he
might
obtain
important
intelligence
the
major
seeing
him
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
his
remonstrances
was
contented
to
attend
him
in
his
second
expedition
which
he
pressed
him
to
undertake
that
same
afternoon
as
trebasi
had
taken
care
to
circulate
a
report
of
his
having
gone
to
dine
at
the
seat
of
a
nobleman
in
the
neighbourhood
our
and
his
squire
deceived
by
this
finesse
presented
themselves
again
under
the
prison
of
the
countess
who
no
sooner
beheld
her
son
return
than
she
earnestly
entreated
him
to
be
gone
by
the
same
sign
which
she
had
before
used
and
he
taking
it
for
granted
that
she
was
debarred
the
use
of
pen
ink
and
paper
and
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
expect
consented
to
retire
and
had
already
moved
to
some
distance
from
the
house
when
in
crossing
a
small
plantation
that
belonged
to
the
castle
they
were
met
by
count
trebasi
and
another
person
on
horseback
at
sight
of
this
apparition
the
blood
mounted
into
renaldo
cheeks
and
his
eyes
began
to
lighten
with
eagerness
and
indignation
which
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
the
ferocious
address
of
the
count
who
advancing
to
melvil
with
a
menacing
air
before
you
proceed
said
he
i
must
know
with
what
view
you
have
been
twice
patroling
round
my
enclosures
and
reconnoitring
the
different
avenues
of
my
house
you
likewise
carry
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
some
person
in
the
family
of
which
my
honour
obliges
me
to
demand
an
had
your
actions
been
always
regulated
by
the
dictates
of
honour
replied
renaldo
i
should
never
have
been
questioned
for
riding
round
that
castle
which
you
know
is
my
rightful
inheritance
or
excluded
from
the
sight
of
a
parent
who
suffers
under
your
tyranny
and
oppression
it
is
my
part
therefore
to
expostulate
and
since
fortune
hath
favoured
me
with
an
opportunity
of
revenging
our
wrongs
in
person
we
shall
not
part
until
you
have
learned
that
the
family
of
the
count
de
melvil
is
not
to
be
injured
with
impunity
here
is
no
advantage
on
either
side
in
point
of
arms
or
number
you
are
better
mounted
than
i
am
and
shall
have
the
choice
of
the
ground
on
which
our
difference
ought
to
be
brought
to
a
speedy
trebasi
whose
courage
was
not
of
the
sentimental
kind
but
purely
owing
to
his
natural
insensibility
of
danger
instead
of
concerting
measures
coolly
for
the
engagement
or
making
any
verbal
reply
to
this
defiance
drew
a
pistol
without
the
least
hesitation
and
fired
it
at
the
face
of
renaldo
part
of
whose
left
eyebrow
was
carried
off
by
the
ball
melvil
was
not
slow
in
returning
the
compliment
which
as
it
was
deliberate
proved
the
more
decisive
for
the
shot
entering
the
count
right
breast
made
its
way
to
the
backbone
with
such
a
shock
as
struck
him
to
the
ground
upon
which
the
other
alighted
in
order
to
improve
the
advantage
he
had
gained
during
this
transaction
farrel
had
lost
his
life
by
the
savage
behaviour
of
trebasi
attendant
who
had
been
a
hussar
officer
and
who
thinking
it
was
his
duty
to
imitate
the
example
of
his
patron
on
this
occasion
discharged
a
pistol
at
the
major
before
he
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
the
hibernian
horse
being
a
common
hireling
and
unaccustomed
to
stand
fire
no
sooner
saw
the
flash
of
pistol
than
starting
aside
he
happened
to
plunge
into
a
hole
and
was
overturned
at
the
very
instant
when
the
hussar
piece
went
off
so
that
no
damage
ensued
to
his
rider
who
pitching
on
his
feet
flew
with
great
nimbleness
to
his
adversary
then
laying
hold
on
one
leg
dismounted
him
in
a
twinkling
and
seizing
his
throat
as
he
lay
would
have
soon
despatched
him
without
the
use
of
firearms
had
he
not
been
prevented
by
his
friend
renaldo
who
desired
him
to
desist
observing
that
his
vengeance
was
already
satisfied
as
the
count
seemed
to
be
in
the
agonies
of
death
the
major
was
loth
to
quit
his
prey
as
he
thought
his
aggressor
had
acted
in
a
treacherous
manner
but
recollecting
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
because
in
all
probability
the
firing
had
alarmed
the
castle
he
took
his
leave
of
the
vanquished
hussar
with
a
couple
of
hearty
kicks
and
mounting
his
horse
followed
melvil
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
kinsman
to
the
countess
and
very
well
disposed
to
grant
him
a
secure
retreat
until
the
troublesome
consequences
of
this
rencontre
should
be
overblown
trebasi
though
to
the
young
gentleman
he
seemed
speechless
and
insensible
had
neither
lost
the
use
of
his
reason
nor
of
his
tongue
but
affected
that
extremity
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
conversation
with
the
victor
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
never
think
of
death
until
he
knocks
at
the
door
and
then
earnestly
entreat
him
to
excuse
them
for
the
present
and
be
so
good
as
to
call
another
time
the
count
had
so
often
escaped
unhurt
in
the
course
of
his
campaigns
that
he
looked
upon
himself
as
invulnerable
and
set
all
danger
at
defiance
though
he
had
hitherto
taken
no
care
of
the
concerns
of
his
soul
he
had
a
large
fund
of
superstition
at
bottom
and
when
the
surgeon
who
examined
his
wound
declared
it
was
mortal
all
the
terrors
of
futurity
took
hold
on
his
imagination
all
the
misdemeanours
of
his
life
presented
themselves
in
aggravated
colours
to
his
recollection
he
implored
the
spiritual
assistance
of
a
good
priest
in
the
neighbourhood
who
in
the
discharge
of
his
own
conscience
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
little
mercy
to
expect
unless
he
would
as
much
as
lay
in
his
power
redress
the
injuries
he
had
done
to
his
as
nothing
lay
heavier
upon
his
soul
than
the
cruelty
and
fraud
he
had
practised
upon
the
family
of
count
melvil
he
earnestly
besought
this
charitable
clergyman
to
mediate
his
pardon
with
the
countess
and
at
the
same
time
desired
to
see
renaldo
before
his
death
that
he
might
put
him
in
possession
of
his
paternal
estate
and
solicit
his
forgiveness
for
the
offence
he
had
given
his
lady
far
from
waiting
for
the
priest
intercession
no
sooner
understood
the
lamentable
situation
of
her
husband
and
found
herself
at
liberty
than
she
hastened
to
his
apartment
expressed
the
utmost
concern
for
his
misfortune
and
tended
him
with
truly
conjugal
tenderness
and
fidelity
her
son
gladly
obeyed
the
summons
and
was
received
with
great
civility
and
satisfaction
by
his
who
in
presence
of
the
judge
and
divers
gentlemen
assembled
for
that
purpose
renounced
all
right
and
title
to
the
fortune
he
had
so
unjustly
usurped
disclosed
the
name
of
the
convent
to
which
mademoiselle
de
melvil
had
been
conveyed
dismissed
all
the
agents
of
his
iniquity
and
being
reconciled
to
his
began
to
prepare
himself
in
tranquillity
for
his
latter
end
the
countess
was
overwhelmed
with
an
excess
of
joy
while
she
embraced
her
son
who
had
proved
himself
so
worthy
of
his
father
yet
this
joy
was
embittered
by
reflecting
that
she
was
made
a
widow
by
the
hands
of
that
darling
son
for
though
she
knew
his
honour
demanded
the
sacrifice
she
could
not
lay
aside
that
regard
and
veneration
which
is
attached
to
the
name
of
husband
and
therefore
resolved
to
retire
into
a
monastery
where
she
could
spend
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
devotion
without
being
exposed
to
any
intercourse
which
might
interfere
with
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiments
on
that
subject
chapter
he
is
the
messenger
of
happiness
to
his
sister
who
removes
the
film
which
had
long
obstructed
his
penetration
with
regard
to
count
fathom
as
the
most
endearing
affection
had
always
subsisted
between
renaldo
and
his
sister
he
would
not
one
moment
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
flying
to
her
embrace
and
of
being
the
glad
messenger
of
her
deliverance
soon
therefore
as
he
understood
the
place
of
her
retreat
and
had
obtained
a
proper
order
to
the
abbess
signed
by
count
trebasi
he
set
out
post
for
vienna
still
accompanied
by
his
faithful
hibernian
and
arriving
at
the
convent
found
the
abbess
and
the
whole
house
so
engrossed
in
making
preparations
for
the
ceremony
of
giving
the
veil
next
day
to
a
young
woman
who
had
fulfilled
the
term
of
her
probation
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
his
sister
with
that
leisure
and
satisfaction
which
he
had
flattered
himself
with
enjoying
at
this
meeting
and
therefore
he
was
fain
to
bridle
his
impatience
for
two
days
and
keep
his
credentials
until
the
hurry
should
be
over
that
mademoiselle
might
have
no
intimation
of
her
good
fortune
except
from
his
own
mouth
in
order
to
fill
up
this
tedious
interval
he
visited
his
friends
at
court
who
were
rejoiced
to
hear
the
happy
issue
of
his
excursion
to
presburg
the
prince
who
was
his
particular
patron
desired
he
would
make
himself
perfectly
easy
with
regard
to
the
death
of
count
trebasi
for
he
would
take
care
to
represent
him
in
such
a
light
to
the
as
would
screen
him
from
any
danger
or
prosecution
on
that
account
his
highness
moreover
appointed
the
following
day
for
performing
the
promise
he
had
made
of
presenting
him
to
that
august
princess
and
in
the
meantime
prepossessed
her
so
much
in
his
favour
that
when
he
approached
her
presence
and
was
announced
by
his
noble
introductor
she
eyed
him
with
a
look
of
peculiar
complacency
saying
i
am
glad
to
see
you
returned
to
my
dominions
your
father
was
a
gallant
officer
who
served
our
house
with
equal
courage
and
fidelity
and
as
i
understand
you
tread
in
his
footsteps
you
may
depend
upon
my
favour
and
he
was
so
much
overwhelmed
with
this
gracious
reception
that
while
he
bowed
in
silence
the
drops
of
gratitude
trickled
from
his
eyes
and
her
imperial
majesty
was
so
well
pleased
with
this
manifestation
of
his
heart
that
she
immediately
gave
directions
for
promoting
him
to
the
command
of
a
troop
of
horse
thus
fortune
seemed
willing
and
indeed
eager
to
discharge
the
debt
she
owed
him
for
the
different
calamities
he
had
undergone
and
as
he
looked
upon
the
generous
hebrew
to
be
the
sole
source
of
his
success
he
did
not
fail
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
happy
effects
of
his
recommendation
and
friendship
and
to
express
in
the
warmest
terms
the
deep
sense
he
had
of
his
uncommon
benevolence
which
by
the
bye
was
still
greater
with
regard
to
renaldo
than
the
reader
as
yet
imagines
for
he
not
only
furnished
him
with
money
for
his
present
occasions
but
also
gave
him
an
unlimited
credit
on
a
banker
in
vienna
to
whom
one
of
his
letters
was
directed
the
ceremony
of
the
nun
admission
being
now
performed
and
the
convent
restored
to
its
former
quiet
melvil
hastened
thither
on
the
wings
of
brotherly
affection
and
presented
his
letter
to
the
abbess
who
having
perused
the
contents
by
which
she
learned
that
the
family
disquiets
of
count
trebasi
no
longer
subsisted
and
that
the
bearer
was
the
brother
of
mademoiselle
she
received
him
with
great
politeness
congratulated
him
on
this
happy
event
and
begging
he
would
excuse
her
staying
with
him
in
the
parlour
on
pretence
of
business
withdrew
saying
she
would
immediately
send
in
a
young
lady
who
would
console
him
for
her
absence
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
joined
by
his
sister
who
expecting
nothing
less
than
to
see
renaldo
no
sooner
distinguished
his
features
than
she
shrieked
aloud
with
surprise
and
would
have
sunk
upon
the
floor
had
not
he
supported
her
in
his
embrace
such
a
sudden
apparition
of
her
brother
at
any
time
or
in
any
place
after
their
long
separation
would
have
strongly
affected
this
sensible
young
lady
but
to
find
him
so
abruptly
in
a
place
where
she
thought
herself
buried
from
the
knowledge
of
all
her
relations
occasioned
such
commotions
in
her
spirits
as
had
endangered
her
reason
for
it
was
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
that
she
could
talk
to
him
with
connexion
or
coherence
however
as
those
transports
subsided
they
entered
into
a
more
deliberate
and
agreeable
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
he
gradually
informed
her
of
what
had
passed
at
the
castle
and
inexpressible
was
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
learning
that
her
mother
was
released
from
captivity
herself
restored
to
freedom
and
her
brother
to
the
possession
of
his
inheritance
by
the
only
means
to
which
she
had
always
prayed
these
blessings
might
be
owing
as
she
had
been
treated
with
uncommon
humanity
by
the
abbess
she
would
not
consent
to
leave
the
convent
until
he
should
be
ready
to
set
out
for
presburg
so
that
they
dined
together
with
that
good
lady
and
passed
the
afternoon
in
that
mutual
communication
with
which
a
brother
and
sister
may
be
supposed
to
entertain
themselves
on
such
an
occasion
she
gave
him
a
detail
of
the
insults
and
mortifications
she
had
suffered
from
the
brutality
of
her
and
told
him
that
her
confinement
in
this
monastery
was
owing
to
trebasi
having
intercepted
a
letter
to
her
from
renaldo
signifying
his
intention
to
return
to
the
empire
in
order
to
assert
his
own
right
and
redress
his
grievances
then
turning
the
discourse
upon
the
incidents
of
his
peregrinations
she
in
a
particular
manner
inquired
about
that
exquisite
beauty
who
had
been
the
innocent
source
of
all
his
distresses
and
upon
whose
perfections
he
had
often
in
his
letters
to
his
sister
expatiated
with
indications
of
rapture
and
delight
this
inquiry
in
a
moment
blew
up
that
scorching
flame
which
had
been
stifled
by
other
necessary
avocations
his
eyes
gleamed
his
cheeks
glowed
and
grew
pale
alternately
and
his
whole
frame
underwent
an
immediate
agitation
which
being
perceived
by
mademoiselle
she
concluded
that
some
new
calamity
was
annexed
to
the
name
of
monimia
and
dreading
to
rip
up
a
wound
which
she
saw
was
so
ineffectually
closed
she
for
the
present
suppressed
her
curiosity
and
concern
and
industriously
endeavoured
to
introduce
some
less
affecting
subject
of
conversation
he
saw
her
aim
approved
of
her
discretion
and
joining
her
endeavours
expressed
his
surprise
at
her
having
omitted
to
signify
the
least
remembrance
of
her
old
favourite
fathom
whom
he
had
left
in
england
he
had
no
sooner
pronounced
this
name
than
she
suffered
some
confusion
in
her
turn
from
which
however
recollecting
herself
brother
said
she
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
that
wretch
who
is
altogether
unworthy
of
retaining
the
smallest
share
of
your
astonished
and
indeed
angry
at
this
expression
which
he
considered
as
the
effect
of
malicious
misrepresentation
he
gently
chid
her
for
her
credulity
in
believing
the
envious
aspersion
of
some
person
who
repined
at
the
superior
virtue
of
fathom
whom
he
affirmed
to
be
an
honour
to
the
human
species
nothing
is
more
easy
replied
the
young
lady
than
to
impose
upon
a
person
who
being
himself
unconscious
of
guile
suspects
no
deceit
you
have
been
a
dupe
dear
brother
not
to
the
finesse
of
fathom
but
to
the
sincerity
of
your
own
heart
for
my
own
part
i
assume
no
honour
to
my
own
penetration
in
having
comprehended
the
villany
of
that
impostor
which
was
discovered
in
more
than
one
instance
by
accidents
i
could
not
possibly
foresee
you
must
know
that
teresa
who
attended
me
from
my
childhood
and
in
whose
honesty
i
reposed
such
confidence
having
disobliged
some
of
the
inferior
servants
was
so
narrowly
watched
in
all
her
transactions
as
to
be
at
last
detected
in
the
very
act
of
conveying
a
piece
of
plate
which
was
actually
found
concealed
among
her
clothes
you
may
guess
how
much
i
was
astonished
when
i
understood
this
circumstance
i
could
not
trust
to
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
and
should
have
still
believed
her
innocent
in
spite
of
ocular
demonstration
had
not
she
in
the
terrors
of
being
tried
for
felony
promised
to
make
a
very
material
discovery
to
the
countess
provided
she
would
take
such
measures
as
would
save
her
life
this
request
being
complied
with
she
in
my
hearing
opened
up
such
an
amazing
scene
of
iniquity
baseness
and
ingratitude
which
had
been
acted
by
her
and
fathom
in
order
to
defraud
the
family
to
which
they
were
so
much
indebted
that
i
could
not
have
believed
the
human
mind
capable
of
such
degeneracy
or
that
traitor
endowed
with
such
pernicious
cunning
and
dissimulation
had
not
her
tale
been
congruous
consistent
and
distinct
and
fraught
with
circumstances
that
left
no
room
to
doubt
the
least
article
of
her
confession
on
consideration
of
which
she
was
permitted
to
go
into
voluntary
she
then
explained
their
combination
in
all
the
particulars
as
we
have
already
recounted
them
in
their
proper
place
and
finally
observed
that
the
opinion
she
had
hence
conceived
of
fathom
character
was
confirmed
by
what
she
had
since
learned
of
his
perfidious
conduct
towards
that
very
nun
who
had
lately
taken
the
veil
perceiving
her
brother
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
and
gaping
with
the
most
eager
attention
she
proceeded
to
relate
the
incidents
of
his
double
intrigue
with
the
jeweller
wife
and
daughter
as
they
were
communicated
to
her
by
the
nun
who
was
no
other
than
the
individual
wilhelmina
after
those
rivals
had
been
forsaken
by
their
gallant
their
mutual
animosities
and
chagrin
served
to
whet
the
attention
and
invention
of
each
so
that
in
a
little
time
the
whole
mystery
stood
disclosed
to
both
the
mother
had
discovered
the
daughter
correspondence
with
fathom
as
we
have
formerly
observed
by
means
of
that
unfortunate
letter
which
he
unwittingly
committed
to
the
charge
of
the
old
beldame
and
as
soon
as
she
understood
he
was
without
the
reach
of
all
solicitation
or
prosecution
imparted
this
billet
to
her
husband
whose
fury
was
so
ungovernable
that
he
had
almost
sacrificed
wilhelmina
with
his
own
hands
especially
when
terrified
by
his
threats
and
imprecations
she
owned
that
she
had
bestowed
the
chain
on
this
perfidious
lover
however
this
dreadful
purpose
was
prevented
partly
by
the
interposition
of
his
wife
whose
aim
was
not
the
death
but
immurement
of
his
daughter
and
partly
by
the
tears
and
supplication
of
the
young
gentlewoman
herself
who
protested
that
although
the
ceremony
of
the
church
had
not
been
performed
she
was
contracted
to
fathom
by
the
most
solemn
vows
to
witness
which
he
invoked
all
the
saints
in
heaven
the
jeweller
upon
cooler
consideration
was
unwilling
to
lose
the
last
spark
of
hope
that
glittered
among
the
ruins
of
his
despair
and
resisted
all
the
importunities
of
his
wife
who
pressed
him
to
consult
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
soul
in
the
fond
expectation
of
finding
some
expedient
to
lure
back
the
chain
and
its
possessor
in
the
meantime
wilhelmina
was
daily
and
hourly
exposed
to
the
mortifying
animadversions
of
her
mamma
who
with
all
the
insolence
of
virtue
incessantly
upbraided
her
with
the
backslidings
of
her
vicious
life
and
exhorted
her
to
reformation
and
repentance
this
continual
triumph
lasted
for
many
months
till
at
length
a
quarrel
happening
between
the
mother
and
the
gossip
at
whose
house
she
used
to
give
the
rendezvous
to
her
admirers
that
incensed
confidante
in
the
precipitation
of
her
anger
promulgated
the
history
of
those
secret
meetings
and
among
the
rest
her
interviews
with
fathom
were
brought
to
light
the
first
people
who
hear
news
of
this
sort
are
generally
those
to
whom
they
are
most
unwelcome
the
german
was
soon
apprised
of
his
frailty
and
considered
the
two
females
of
his
house
as
a
couple
of
devils
incarnate
sent
from
hell
to
exercise
his
patience
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
displeasure
he
found
matter
of
consolation
in
being
furnished
with
a
sufficient
reason
for
parting
with
his
helpmate
who
had
for
many
years
kept
his
family
in
disquiet
he
therefore
without
hazarding
a
personal
conference
sent
proposals
to
her
by
a
friend
which
she
did
not
think
proper
to
reject
and
seeing
himself
restored
to
the
dominion
of
his
own
house
exerted
his
sway
so
tyrannically
that
wilhelmina
became
weary
of
her
life
and
had
recourse
to
the
comforts
of
religion
of
which
she
soon
became
enamoured
and
begged
her
permission
to
dedicate
the
rest
of
her
life
to
the
duties
of
devotion
she
was
accordingly
received
in
this
convent
the
regulations
of
which
were
so
much
to
her
liking
that
she
performed
the
task
of
probation
with
pleasure
and
voluntarily
excluded
herself
from
the
vanities
of
this
life
it
was
here
she
had
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
mademoiselle
de
melvil
to
whom
she
communicated
her
complaints
of
fathom
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
related
to
the
count
as
he
himself
had
often
declared
while
the
young
lady
rehearsed
the
particulars
of
this
detail
renaldo
sustained
a
strange
vicissitude
of
different
passions
surprise
sorrow
fear
hope
and
indignation
raised
a
most
tumultuous
conflict
in
his
bosom
monimia
rushed
upon
his
imagination
in
the
character
of
innocence
betrayed
by
the
insinuations
of
treachery
he
with
horror
viewed
her
at
the
mercy
of
a
villain
who
had
broken
all
the
ties
of
gratitude
and
honour
affrighted
at
the
prospect
he
started
from
his
seat
exclaiming
in
the
most
unconnected
strain
of
distraction
and
despair
have
i
then
nourished
a
serpent
in
my
bosom
have
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
a
traitor
who
hath
murdered
my
peace
who
hath
torn
my
asunder
and
perhaps
ruined
the
pattern
of
all
earthly
perfection
it
can
not
be
heaven
would
not
suffer
such
infernal
artifice
to
take
effect
the
thunder
would
be
levelled
against
the
head
of
the
accursed
from
this
transport
compared
with
his
agitation
when
he
mentioned
monimia
his
sister
judged
that
fathom
had
been
the
occasion
of
a
breach
between
the
two
lovers
and
this
conjecture
being
confirmed
by
the
disjointed
answers
he
made
to
her
interrogations
upon
the
affair
she
endeavoured
to
calm
his
apprehensions
by
representing
that
he
would
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
returning
to
england
where
the
misunderstanding
might
be
easily
cleared
up
and
that
in
the
meantime
he
had
nothing
to
fear
on
account
of
the
person
of
his
mistress
in
a
country
where
individuals
were
so
well
protected
by
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
realm
at
length
he
suffered
himself
to
be
flattered
with
the
fond
hope
of
seeing
monimia
character
triumph
in
the
inquiry
of
retrieving
that
lost
jewel
and
of
renewing
that
ravishing
intercourse
and
exalted
expectation
which
had
been
so
cruelly
cut
off
he
now
wished
to
find
fathom
as
black
as
he
had
been
exhibited
that
monimia
apostasy
might
be
numbered
among
the
misrepresentations
of
his
treachery
and
fraud
his
love
which
was
alike
generous
and
ardent
espoused
the
cause
and
he
no
longer
doubted
her
constancy
and
virtue
but
when
he
reflected
how
her
tender
heart
must
have
been
wrung
with
anguish
at
his
unkindness
and
cruelty
in
leaving
her
destitute
in
a
foreign
land
how
her
sensibility
must
have
been
tortured
in
finding
herself
altogether
dependent
upon
a
ruffian
who
certainly
harboured
the
most
baleful
designs
upon
her
honour
how
her
life
must
be
endangered
both
by
his
barbarity
and
her
own
despair
i
say
when
he
reflected
on
these
circumstances
he
shuddered
with
horror
and
dismay
and
that
very
night
despatched
a
letter
to
his
friend
the
jew
entreating
him
in
the
most
pressing
manner
to
employ
all
his
intelligence
in
learning
the
situation
of
the
fair
orphan
that
she
might
be
protected
from
the
villany
of
fathom
until
his
return
to
england
chapter
sixty
he
recompenses
the
attachment
of
his
friend
and
receives
a
letter
that
reduces
him
to
the
verge
of
death
and
distraction
this
step
being
taken
his
mind
in
some
measure
retrieved
its
former
tranquillity
he
soothed
himself
with
the
prospect
of
a
happy
reconciliation
with
the
divine
monimia
and
his
fancy
was
decoyed
from
every
disagreeable
presage
by
the
entertaining
conversation
of
his
sister
with
whom
in
two
days
he
set
out
for
presburg
attended
by
his
friend
the
major
who
had
never
quitted
him
since
their
meeting
at
brussels
here
they
found
count
trebasi
entirely
rid
of
the
fever
which
had
been
occasioned
by
his
wound
and
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
a
circumstance
that
afforded
unspeakable
pleasure
to
melvil
whose
manner
of
thinking
was
such
as
would
have
made
him
unhappy
could
he
have
charged
himself
with
the
death
of
his
mother
husband
howsoever
criminal
he
might
have
been
the
count
ferocity
did
not
return
with
his
health
his
eyes
were
opened
by
the
danger
he
had
incurred
and
his
sentiments
turned
in
a
new
channel
he
heartily
asked
pardon
of
mademoiselle
for
the
rigorous
usage
she
had
suffered
from
the
violence
of
his
temper
thanked
renaldo
for
the
seasonable
lesson
he
had
administered
to
him
and
not
only
insisted
upon
being
removed
from
the
castle
to
a
house
of
his
own
in
presburg
but
proffered
to
make
immediate
restitution
of
all
the
rents
which
he
had
unjustly
converted
to
his
own
use
these
things
being
settled
in
the
most
amicable
manner
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
parties
concerned
as
well
as
of
the
neighbouring
noblesse
among
whom
the
house
of
melvil
was
in
universal
esteem
renaldo
resolved
to
solicit
leave
at
the
imperial
court
to
return
to
england
in
order
to
investigate
that
affair
of
monimia
which
was
more
interesting
than
all
the
points
he
had
hitherto
adjusted
but
before
he
quitted
presburg
his
friend
farrel
taking
him
aside
one
day
count
said
he
will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
if
by
my
zeal
and
attachment
for
you
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
your
esteem
to
doubt
that
esteem
replied
renaldo
were
to
suspect
my
gratitude
and
honour
of
which
i
must
be
utterly
destitute
before
i
lose
the
sense
of
those
obligations
i
owe
to
your
gallantry
and
friendship
obligations
which
i
long
for
a
proper
occasion
to
well
then
resumed
the
major
i
will
deal
with
you
like
a
downright
swiss
and
point
out
a
method
by
which
you
may
shift
the
load
of
obligation
from
your
own
shoulders
to
mine
you
know
my
birth
rank
and
expectations
in
the
service
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
as
my
expense
has
always
unavoidably
exceeded
my
income
i
find
myself
a
little
out
at
elbows
in
my
circumstances
and
want
to
piece
them
up
by
matrimony
of
those
ladies
with
whom
i
think
i
have
any
chance
of
succeeding
mademoiselle
de
melvil
seems
the
best
qualified
to
render
my
situation
happy
in
all
respects
her
fortune
is
more
than
sufficient
to
disembarrass
my
affairs
her
good
sense
will
be
a
seasonable
check
upon
my
vivacity
her
agreeable
accomplishments
will
engage
a
continuation
of
affection
and
regard
i
know
my
own
disposition
well
enough
to
think
i
shall
become
a
most
dutiful
and
tractable
husband
and
shall
deem
myself
highly
honoured
in
being
more
closely
united
to
my
dear
count
de
melvil
the
son
and
representative
of
that
worthy
officer
under
whom
my
youth
was
formed
if
you
will
therefore
sanction
my
claim
i
will
forthwith
begin
my
approaches
and
doubt
not
under
your
auspices
to
bring
the
place
to
a
renaldo
was
pleased
with
the
frankness
of
this
declaration
approved
of
his
demand
and
desired
him
to
depend
upon
his
good
offices
with
his
sister
whom
he
sounded
that
same
evening
upon
the
subject
recommending
the
major
to
her
favour
as
a
gentleman
well
worthy
of
her
choice
mademoiselle
who
had
never
been
exercised
in
the
coquetries
of
her
sex
and
was
now
arrived
at
those
years
when
the
vanity
of
youth
ought
to
yield
to
discretion
considered
the
proposal
as
a
philosopher
and
after
due
deliberation
candidly
owned
she
had
no
objection
to
the
match
farrel
was
accordingly
introduced
in
the
character
of
a
lover
after
the
permission
of
the
countess
had
been
obtained
and
he
carried
on
his
addresses
in
the
usual
form
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
in
the
event
that
a
day
was
appointed
for
the
celebration
of
his
nuptials
when
he
entered
into
peaceable
possession
of
his
prize
a
few
days
after
this
joyful
occasion
while
renaldo
was
at
vienna
where
he
had
been
indulged
with
leave
of
absence
for
six
months
and
employed
in
making
preparations
for
his
journey
to
britain
he
was
one
evening
presented
by
his
servant
with
a
package
from
london
which
he
no
sooner
opened
than
he
found
enclosed
a
letter
directed
to
him
in
the
handwriting
of
monimia
he
was
so
much
affected
at
sight
of
those
characters
that
he
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
eager
to
know
the
contents
yet
afraid
to
peruse
the
billet
while
he
hesitated
in
this
suspense
he
chanced
to
cast
his
eye
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
and
perceived
the
name
of
his
jewish
friend
at
the
bottom
of
a
few
lines
importing
that
the
enclosed
was
delivered
to
him
by
a
physician
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
recommended
it
in
a
particular
manner
to
his
care
this
intimation
served
only
to
increase
the
mystery
and
whet
his
impatience
and
as
he
had
the
explanation
in
his
hand
he
summoned
all
his
resolution
to
his
aid
and
breaking
the
seal
began
to
read
these
words
renaldo
will
not
suppose
that
this
address
proceeds
from
interested
motives
when
he
learns
that
before
it
can
be
presented
to
his
view
the
unfortunate
monimia
will
be
no
here
the
light
forsook
renaldo
eyes
his
knees
knocked
together
and
he
fell
at
full
length
insensible
on
the
floor
his
valet
hearing
the
noise
ran
into
the
apartment
lifted
him
upon
a
couch
and
despatched
a
messenger
for
proper
assistance
while
he
himself
endeavoured
to
recall
his
spirits
by
such
applications
as
chance
afforded
but
before
the
count
exhibited
any
signs
of
life
his
entered
his
chamber
by
accident
and
as
soon
as
he
recollected
himself
from
the
extreme
confusion
and
concern
produced
by
this
melancholy
spectacle
he
perceived
the
fatal
epistle
which
melvil
though
insensible
still
kept
within
his
grasp
justly
suspecting
this
to
be
the
cause
of
that
severe
paroxysm
he
drew
near
the
couch
and
with
difficulty
read
what
is
above
rehearsed
and
the
sequel
to
this
effect
yes
i
have
taken
such
measures
as
will
prevent
it
from
falling
into
your
hands
until
after
i
shall
have
been
released
from
a
being
embittered
with
inexpressible
misery
and
anguish
it
is
not
my
intention
once
loved
and
ah
still
too
fondly
remembered
youth
to
upbraid
you
as
the
source
of
that
unceasing
woe
which
hath
been
so
long
the
sole
inhabitant
of
my
lonely
bosom
i
will
not
call
you
inconstant
or
unkind
i
dare
not
think
you
base
or
dishonourable
yet
i
was
abruptly
sacrificed
to
a
triumphant
rival
before
i
had
learned
to
bear
such
mortification
before
i
had
overcome
the
prejudices
which
i
had
imbibed
in
my
father
house
i
was
all
at
once
abandoned
to
despair
to
indigence
and
distress
to
the
vile
practices
of
a
villain
who
i
fear
hath
betrayed
us
both
what
have
not
i
suffered
from
the
insults
and
vicious
designs
of
that
wretch
whom
you
cherished
in
your
bosom
yet
to
these
i
owe
this
near
approach
to
that
goal
of
peace
where
the
of
sorrow
will
expire
beware
of
that
artful
traitor
and
oh
endeavour
to
overcome
that
levity
of
disposition
which
if
indulged
will
not
only
stain
your
reputation
but
also
debauch
the
good
qualities
of
your
heart
i
release
you
in
the
sight
of
heaven
from
all
obligations
if
i
have
been
injured
let
not
my
wrongs
be
visited
on
the
head
of
renaldo
for
whom
shall
be
offered
up
the
last
fervent
prayers
of
the
hapless
this
letter
was
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
of
melvil
distress
though
the
major
had
never
heard
him
mention
the
name
of
this
beauty
he
had
received
such
hints
from
his
own
wife
as
enabled
him
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
the
count
disaster
by
the
administration
of
stimulating
medicines
renaldo
recovered
his
perception
but
this
was
a
cruel
alternative
considering
the
situation
of
his
thoughts
the
first
word
he
pronounced
was
monimia
with
all
the
emphasis
of
the
most
violent
despair
he
perused
the
letter
and
poured
forth
incoherent
execrations
against
fathom
and
himself
he
exclaimed
in
a
frantic
tone
she
is
lost
for
ever
murdered
by
my
unkindness
we
are
both
undone
by
the
infernal
arts
of
fathom
execrable
monster
restore
her
to
my
arms
if
thou
art
not
a
fiend
in
reality
i
will
tear
out
thy
false
so
saying
he
sprung
upon
his
valet
who
would
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
undistinguishing
fury
had
not
he
been
saved
by
the
interposition
of
farrel
and
the
family
who
disengaged
him
from
his
master
gripe
by
dint
of
force
yet
notwithstanding
their
joint
endeavours
he
broke
from
this
restraint
leaped
upon
the
floor
and
seizing
his
sword
attempted
to
plunge
it
in
his
own
breast
when
he
was
once
more
overcome
by
numbers
he
cursed
himself
and
all
those
who
withheld
him
swore
he
would
not
survive
the
fair
victim
who
had
perished
by
his
credulity
and
indiscretion
and
the
agitation
of
his
spirits
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
seized
with
strong
convulsions
which
nature
was
scarce
able
to
sustain
every
medical
expedient
was
used
to
quiet
his
perturbation
which
at
length
yielded
so
far
as
to
subside
into
a
continual
fever
and
confirmed
delirium
during
which
he
ceased
not
to
pour
forth
the
most
pathetic
complaints
touching
his
ruined
love
and
to
rave
about
the
monimia
the
major
half
distracted
by
the
calamity
of
his
friend
would
have
concealed
it
from
the
knowledge
of
his
family
had
not
the
physician
by
despairing
of
his
life
laid
him
under
the
necessity
of
making
them
acquainted
with
his
condition
the
countess
and
farrel
were
no
sooner
informed
of
his
case
than
they
hastened
to
the
melancholy
scene
where
they
found
renaldo
deprived
of
his
senses
panting
under
the
rage
of
an
exasperated
disease
they
saw
his
face
distorted
and
his
eyes
glaring
with
frenzy
they
heard
him
invoke
the
name
of
monimia
with
a
tenderness
of
accent
which
even
the
impulse
of
madness
could
not
destroy
then
with
a
sudden
transition
of
tone
and
gesture
he
denounced
vengeance
against
her
betrayer
and
called
upon
the
north
wind
to
cool
the
fervour
of
his
brain
his
hair
hung
in
dishevelled
parcels
his
cheeks
were
wan
his
looks
ghastly
his
vigour
was
fled
and
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
faded
the
physician
hung
his
head
in
silence
the
attendants
wrung
their
hands
in
despair
and
the
countenance
of
his
friend
was
bathed
in
tears
such
a
picture
would
have
moved
the
most
obdurate
heart
what
impression
then
must
it
have
made
upon
a
parent
and
sister
melting
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
affection
the
mother
was
struck
dumb
and
stupefied
with
grief
the
sister
threw
herself
on
the
bed
in
a
transport
of
sorrow
caught
her
loved
renaldo
in
her
arms
and
was
with
great
difficulty
torn
from
his
embrace
such
was
the
dismal
reverse
that
overtook
the
late
so
happy
family
of
melvil
such
was
the
extremity
to
which
the
treachery
of
fathom
had
reduced
his
best
benefactor
three
days
did
nature
struggle
with
surprising
efforts
and
then
the
constitution
seemed
to
sink
under
the
victorious
fever
yet
as
his
strength
diminished
his
delirium
abated
and
on
the
fifth
morning
he
looked
round
and
recognised
his
weeping
friends
though
now
exhausted
to
the
lowest
ebb
of
life
he
retained
the
perfect
use
of
speech
and
his
reason
being
quite
unclouded
spoke
to
each
with
equal
kindness
and
composure
he
congratulated
himself
upon
the
sight
of
shore
after
the
horrors
of
such
a
tempest
called
upon
the
countess
and
his
sister
who
were
not
permitted
to
see
him
at
such
a
conjuncture
and
being
apprised
by
the
major
of
his
reason
for
excluding
them
from
his
presence
he
applauded
his
concern
bequeathed
them
to
his
future
care
and
took
leave
of
that
gentleman
with
a
cordial
embrace
then
he
desired
to
be
left
in
private
with
a
certain
clergyman
who
regulated
the
concerns
of
his
soul
and
he
being
dismissed
turned
his
face
from
the
light
in
expectation
of
his
final
discharge
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
still
and
dreary
he
was
no
longer
heard
to
breathe
no
more
the
stream
of
life
was
perceived
to
circulate
he
was
supposed
to
be
absolved
from
all
his
cares
and
an
universal
groan
from
the
bystanders
announced
the
decease
of
the
gallant
generous
and
renaldo
come
hither
ye
whom
the
pride
of
youth
and
health
of
birth
and
affluence
inflames
who
tread
the
flowery
maze
of
pleasure
trusting
to
the
fruition
of
joys
ye
who
glory
in
your
accomplishments
who
indulge
the
views
of
ambition
and
lay
schemes
for
future
happiness
and
grandeur
contemplate
here
the
vanity
of
life
behold
how
low
this
excellent
young
man
is
laid
mowed
down
even
in
the
blossom
of
his
youth
when
fortune
seemed
to
open
all
her
treasures
to
his
worth
such
were
the
reflections
of
the
generous
farrel
who
while
he
performed
the
last
office
of
friendship
in
closing
the
eyes
of
the
melvil
perceived
a
warmth
on
the
skin
which
the
hand
of
death
seldom
leaves
unextinguished
this
uncommon
sensation
he
reported
to
the
physician
who
though
he
could
feel
no
pulsation
of
the
heart
or
arteries
conjectured
that
life
still
lingered
in
some
of
its
interior
haunts
and
immediately
ordered
such
applications
to
the
extremities
and
surface
of
the
body
as
might
help
to
concentrate
and
reinforce
the
natural
heat
by
these
prescriptions
which
for
some
time
produced
no
sensible
effect
the
embers
were
in
all
probability
kept
glowing
and
the
vital
power
revived
for
after
a
considerable
pause
respiration
was
gradually
renewed
at
long
intervals
a
languid
motion
was
perceived
at
the
heart
a
few
feeble
and
irregular
pulsations
were
felt
at
the
wrist
the
livery
of
death
began
to
vanish
from
his
face
the
circulation
acquired
new
force
and
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
which
proclaimed
his
return
from
the
shades
of
death
when
he
recovered
the
faculty
of
swallowing
a
cordial
was
administered
and
whether
the
fever
abated
in
consequence
of
the
blood
being
cooled
and
condensed
during
the
recess
of
action
in
the
solids
or
nature
in
that
agony
had
prepared
a
proper
channel
for
the
expulsion
of
the
disease
certain
it
is
he
was
from
this
moment
rid
of
all
bodily
pain
he
retrieved
the
animal
functions
and
nothing
remained
of
his
malady
but
an
extreme
weakness
and
languor
the
effect
of
nature
being
fatigued
in
the
battle
she
had
won
unutterable
was
the
joy
that
took
possession
of
his
mother
and
sister
when
farrel
flew
into
her
apartment
to
intimate
this
happy
turn
scarce
could
they
be
restrained
from
pouring
forth
their
transports
in
the
presence
of
renaldo
who
was
still
too
feeble
to
endure
such
communication
indeed
he
was
extremely
mortified
and
dejected
at
this
event
which
had
diffused
such
pleasure
and
satisfaction
among
his
friends
for
though
his
distemper
was
mastered
the
fatal
cause
of
it
still
rankled
at
his
heart
and
he
considered
this
respite
from
death
as
a
protraction
of
his
misery
when
he
was
congratulated
by
the
major
on
the
triumph
of
his
constitution
he
replied
with
a
groan
i
would
to
heaven
it
had
been
otherwise
for
i
am
reserved
for
all
the
horrors
of
the
most
poignant
sorrow
and
remorse
o
monimia
monimia
i
hoped
by
this
time
to
have
convinced
thy
gentle
shade
that
i
was
at
least
intentionally
innocent
of
that
ruthless
barbarity
which
hath
brought
thee
to
an
untimely
grave
heaven
and
earth
do
i
still
survive
the
consciousness
of
that
dire
catastrophe
and
lives
the
atrocious
villain
who
hath
blasted
all
our
hopes
with
these
last
words
the
fire
darted
from
his
eyes
and
his
brother
snatching
this
occasional
handle
for
reconciling
him
to
life
joined
in
his
exclamations
against
the
treacherous
fathom
and
observed
that
he
should
not
in
point
of
honour
wish
to
die
until
he
should
have
sacrificed
that
traitor
to
the
manes
of
the
beauteous
monimia
this
incitement
acted
as
a
spur
upon
exhausted
nature
causing
the
blood
to
circulate
with
fresh
vigour
and
encouraging
him
to
take
such
sustenance
as
would
recruit
his
strength
and
repair
the
damage
which
his
health
had
sustained
his
sister
assiduously
attended
him
in
his
recovery
flattering
his
appetite
and
amusing
his
sorrow
at
the
same
time
the
clergyman
assailed
his
despondence
with
religious
weapons
as
well
as
with
arguments
drawn
from
philosophy
and
the
fury
of
his
passions
being
already
expended
he
became
so
tractable
as
to
listen
to
his
remonstrances
but
notwithstanding
the
joint
endeavours
of
all
his
friends
a
deep
fixed
melancholy
remained
after
every
consequence
of
his
disease
had
vanished
in
vain
they
essayed
to
elude
his
grief
by
gaiety
and
diversions
in
vain
they
tried
to
decoy
his
heart
into
some
new
engagement
these
kind
attempts
served
only
to
feed
and
nourish
that
melancholy
which
pined
within
his
bosom
monimia
still
haunted
him
in
the
midst
of
these
amusements
while
his
reflection
whispered
to
him
pleasures
like
these
i
might
have
relished
with
her
that
darling
idea
mingled
in
all
the
female
assemblies
at
which
he
was
present
eclipsing
their
attractions
and
enhancing
the
bitterness
of
his
loss
for
absence
enthusiasm
and
even
his
despair
had
heightened
the
charms
of
the
fair
orphan
into
something
supernatural
and
divine
time
that
commonly
weakens
the
traces
of
remembrance
seemed
to
deepen
its
impressions
in
his
breast
nightly
in
his
dreams
did
he
converse
with
his
dear
monimia
sometimes
on
the
verdant
bank
of
a
delightful
stream
where
he
breathed
in
soft
murmurs
the
dictates
of
his
love
and
admiration
sometimes
reclined
within
the
tufted
grove
his
arm
encircled
and
sustained
her
snowy
neck
whilst
she
with
looks
of
love
ineffable
gazed
on
his
face
invoking
heaven
to
bless
her
husband
and
her
lord
yet
even
in
these
illusions
was
his
fancy
oft
alarmed
for
the
fair
sometimes
he
viewed
her
tottering
on
the
brink
of
a
steep
precipice
far
distant
from
his
helping
hand
at
other
times
she
seemed
to
sail
along
the
boisterous
tide
imploring
his
assistance
then
would
he
start
with
horror
from
his
sleep
and
feel
his
sorrows
more
than
realised
he
deserted
his
couch
he
avoided
the
society
of
mankind
he
courted
sequestered
shades
where
he
could
indulge
his
melancholy
there
his
mind
brooded
over
his
calamity
until
his
imagination
became
familiar
with
all
the
ravages
of
death
it
contemplated
the
gradual
decline
of
monimia
health
her
tears
her
distress
her
despair
at
his
imagined
cruelty
he
saw
through
that
perspective
every
blossom
of
her
beauty
wither
every
sparkle
vanish
from
her
eyes
he
beheld
her
faded
lips
her
pale
cheek
and
her
inanimated
features
the
symmetry
of
which
not
death
itself
was
able
to
destroy
his
fancy
conveyed
her
breathless
corse
to
the
cold
grave
which
perhaps
no
tear
humane
was
shed
where
her
delicate
limbs
were
consigned
to
dust
where
she
was
dished
out
a
delicious
banquet
to
the
unsparing
worm
over
these
pictures
he
dwelt
with
a
sort
of
pleasing
anguish
until
he
became
so
enamoured
of
her
tomb
that
he
could
no
longer
resist
the
desire
that
compelled
him
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
dear
hallowed
spot
where
all
his
once
gay
hopes
lay
buried
that
he
might
nightly
visit
the
silent
habitation
of
his
ruined
love
embrace
the
sacred
earth
with
which
she
was
now
compounded
moisten
it
with
his
tears
and
bid
the
turf
lie
easy
on
her
breast
besides
the
prospect
of
this
gloomy
enjoyment
he
was
urged
to
return
to
england
by
an
eager
desire
of
taking
vengeance
on
the
perfidious
fathom
as
well
as
of
acquitting
himself
of
the
obligations
he
owed
in
that
kingdom
to
those
who
had
assisted
him
in
his
distress
he
therefore
communicated
his
intention
to
farrel
who
would
have
insisted
upon
attending
him
in
the
journey
had
not
he
been
conjured
to
stay
and
manage
renaldo
affairs
in
his
absence
every
previous
step
being
taken
he
took
leave
of
the
countess
and
his
sister
who
had
with
all
their
interest
and
elocution
opposed
his
design
the
execution
of
which
they
justly
feared
would
instead
of
dissipating
augment
his
chagrin
and
now
seeing
him
determined
they
shed
a
flood
of
tears
at
his
departure
and
he
set
out
from
vienna
in
a
accompanied
by
a
trusty

horseback
chapter
renaldo
meets
with
a
living
monument
of
justice
and
encounters
a
personage
of
some
note
in
these
memoirs
as
this
domestic
was
very
well
qualified
for
making
all
the
proper
dispositions
and
adjusting
every
necessary
article
on
the
road
renaldo
totally
abstracted
himself
from
earthly
considerations
and
mused
without
ceasing
on
that
theme
which
was
the
constant
subject
of
his
contemplation
he
was
blind
to
the
objects
that
surrounded
him
he
scarce
ever
felt
the
importunities
of
nature
and
had
not
they
been
reinforced
by
the
pressing
entreaties
of
his
attendant
he
would
have
proceeded
without
refreshment
or
repose
in
this
absence
of
mind
did
he
traverse
a
great
part
of
germany
in
his
way
to
the
austrian
netherlands
and
arrived
at
the
fortress
of
luxemburg
where
he
was
obliged
to
tarry
a
whole
day
on
account
of
an
accident
which
had
happened
to
his
chaise
here
he
went
to
view
the
fortifications
and
as
he
walked
along
the
ramparts
his
ears
were
saluted
with
these
words
heaven
bless
the
noble
count
de
melvil
will
not
he
turn
the
eyes
of
compassion
on
an
old
reduced
to
misfortune
and
disgrace
surprised
at
this
address
which
was
attended
with
the
clanking
of
chains
renaldo
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
perceived
the
person
who
spoke
to
be
one
of
two
malefactors
shackled
together
who
had
been
sentenced
for
some
crime
to
work
as
labourers
on
the
fortifications
his
face
was
so
covered
with
hair
and
his
whole
appearance
so
disguised
by
the
squalid
habit
which
he
wore
that
the
count
could
not
recollect
his
features
until
he
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
name
was
ratchcali
melvil
immediately
recognised
his
at
vienna
and
his
upon
the
rhine
and
expressed
equal
surprise
and
concern
at
seeing
him
in
such
a
deplorable
situation
nothing
renders
the
soul
so
callous
and
insensible
as
the
searing
brands
of
infamy
and
disgrace
without
betraying
the
least
symptoms
of
shame
or
confusion
count
says
he
this
is
the
fate
of
war
at
least
of
the
war
in
which
i
have
been
engaged
ever
since
i
took
leave
of
the
imperial
army
and
retreated
with
your
old
companion
fathom
long
life
to
that
original
genius
if
he
is
not
unhappily
eclipsed
by
some
unfortunate
interposition
before
his
terrene
parts
are
purified
i
foresee
that
he
will
shine
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
world
of
at
mention
of
this
detested
name
renaldo
heart
began
to
throb
with
indignation
yet
he
suppressed
the
emotion
and
desired
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
splendid
encomium
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
his
confederate
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
replied
ratchcali
for
a
man
in
my
present
situation
to
equivocate
or
disguise
the
truth
the
nature
of
my
disgrace
is
perfectly
well
known
i
am
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
life
and
unless
some
lucky
accident
which
i
can
not
now
foresee
shall
intervene
all
i
can
expect
is
some
alleviation
of
my
hard
lot
from
the
generosity
of
such
gentlemen
as
you
who
compassionate
the
sufferings
of
your
in
order
to
engage
your
benevolence
the
more
in
my
behalf
i
shall
if
you
will
give
me
the
hearing
faithfully
inform
you
of
some
particulars
which
it
may
import
you
to
know
concerning
my
old
acquaintance
ferdinand
count
fathom
whose
real
character
hath
perhaps
hitherto
escaped
your
then
he
proceeded
to
give
a
regular
detail
of
all
the
strokes
of
finesse
which
he
in
conjunction
with
our
adventurer
had
practised
upon
melvil
and
others
during
their
residence
at
vienna
and
the
campaigns
they
had
made
upon
the
rhine
he
explained
the
nature
of
the
robbery
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
done
by
the
count
valet
together
with
the
manner
of
their
desertion
he
described
his
separation
from
fathom
their
meeting
at
london
the
traffic
they
carried
on
in
copartnership
and
the
misfortune
that
reduced
ferdinand
to
the
condition
in
which
he
was
found
by
melvil
after
having
gratified
the
honest
lawyer
said
he
with
a
share
of
the
unfortunate
fathom
spoils
and
packed
up
all
my
own
valuable
effects
my
new
auxiliary
maurice
and
i
posted
to
harwich
embarked
in
the
and
next
day
arrived
at
helvoetsluys
from
thence
we
repaired
to
the
hague
in
order
to
mingle
in
the
gaieties
of
the
place
and
exercise
our
talents
at
play
which
is
there
cultivated
with
universal
eagerness
but
chancing
to
meet
with
an
old
acquaintance
whom
i
did
not
at
all
desire
to
see
i
found
it
convenient
to
withdraw
softly
to
rotterdam
from
whence
we
set
out
for
antwerp
and
having
made
a
tour
of
the
austrian
netherlands
set
up
our
rest
at
brussels
and
concerted
a
plan
for
laying
the
flemings
under
contribution
from
our
appearance
we
procured
admission
into
the
most
polite
assemblies
and
succeeded
to
a
wonder
in
all
our
operations
until
our
career
was
unfortunately
checked
by
the
indiscretion
of
my
ally
who
being
detected
in
the
very
act
of
conveying
a
card
was
immediately
introduced
to
a
magistrate
and
this
minister
of
justice
was
so
curious
inquisitive
and
that
count
maurice
finding
it
impossible
to
elude
his
penetration
was
fain
to
stipulate
for
his
own
safety
by
giving
up
his
friend
to
the
cognisance
of
the
law
i
was
accordingly
apprehended
before
i
knew
the
cause
of
my
arrest
and
being
unhappily
known
by
some
soldiers
of
the
prince
guard
my
character
turned
out
so
little
to
the
approbation
of
the
inquisitors
that
all
my
effects
were
confiscated
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
and
i
was
by
a
formal
sentence
condemned
to
labour
on
the
fortifications
all
the
days
of
my
life
while
maurice
escaped
at
the
expense
of
five
hundred
stripes
which
he
received
in
public
from
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
thus
have
i
without
evasion
or
mental
reservation
given
a
faithful
account
of
the
steps
by
which
i
have
arrived
at
this
barrier
which
is
likely
to
be
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
my
peregrinations
unless
the
generous
count
de
melvil
will
deign
to
interpose
his
interest
in
behalf
of
an
old
who
may
yet
live
to
justify
his
renaldo
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
story
every
circumstance
of
which
tended
to
corroborate
the
intelligence
he
had
already
received
touching
the
character
of
fathom
whom
he
now
considered
with
a
double
portion
of
abhorrence
as
the
most
abandoned
miscreant
that
nature
had
ever
produced
though
ratchcali
did
not
possess
a
much
higher
place
in
his
opinion
he
favoured
him
with
marks
of
his
bounty
and
exhorted
him
if
possible
to
reform
his
heart
but
he
would
by
no
means
promise
to
interpose
his
credit
in
favour
of
a
wretch
of
such
enormous
villany
and
fraud
he
could
not
help
moralising
upon
this
rencontre
which
inspired
him
with
great
contempt
for
human
nature
and
next
day
he
proceeded
on
his
journey
with
a
heavy
heart
ruminating
on
the
perfidy
of
mankind
and
between
whiles
transported
with
the
prospect
of
revenging
all
his
calamities
upon
the
accursed
author
while
he
was
wrapped
up
in
these
reveries
his
carriage
rolled
along
and
had
already
entered
a
wood
between
mons
and
tournay
when
his
dream
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
explosion
of
several
pistols
that
were
fired
among
the
thickets
at
a
little
distance
from
the
road
roused
at
this
alarm
he
snatched
his
sword
that
stood
by
him
and
springing
from
the
chaise
ran
directly
towards
the
spot
being
close
followed
by
his
valet
who
had
alighted
and
armed
himself
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
about
forty
yards
from
the
highway
they
arrived
in
a
little
glade
or
opening
where
they
saw
a
single
man
standing
at
bay
against
five
banditti
after
having
killed
one
of
their
companions
and
lost
his
own
horse
that
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
melvil
seeing
this
odds
and
immediately
guessing
their
design
rushed
among
them
without
hesitation
and
in
an
instant
ran
his
sword
through
the
heart
of
one
whose
hand
was
raised
to
smite
the
gentleman
behind
while
he
was
engaged
with
the
rest
in
front
at
the
same
time
the
valet
disabled
another
by
a
shot
in
the
shoulder
so
that
the
number
being
now
equal
on
both
sides
a
furious
combat
ensued
every
man
being
paired
with
an
antagonist
and
each
having
recourse
to
swords
as
all
their
pieces
had
been
discharged
renaldo
adversary
finding
himself
pressed
with
equal
fury
and
skill
retreated
gradually
among
the
trees
until
he
vanished
altogether
into
the
thickest
of
the
wood
and
his
two
companions
followed
his
example
with
great
ease
the
being
hurt
in
the
leg
and
the
stranger
so
much
exhausted
by
the
wounds
he
had
received
before
renaldo
interposition
that
when
the
young
gentleman
approached
to
congratulate
him
on
the
defeat
of
the
robbers
he
in
advancing
to
embrace
his
deliverer
dropped
down
motionless
on
the
grass
the
count
with
that
warmth
of
sympathy
and
benevolence
which
was
natural
to
his
heart
lifted
up
the
wounded
cavalier
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
chaise
in
which
he
was
deposited
while
the
reloaded
his
pistols
and
prepared
for
a
second
attack
as
they
did
not
doubt
that
the
banditti
would
return
with
a
reinforcement
however
before
they
reappeared
renaldo
driver
disengaged
him
from
the
wood
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
arrived
at
a
village
where
they
halted
for
assistance
to
the
stranger
who
though
still
alive
had
not
recovered
the
use
of
his
senses
after
he
was
undressed
and
laid
in
a
warm
bed
a
surgeon
examined
his
body
and
found
a
wound
in
his
neck
by
a
sword
and
another
in
his
right
side
occasioned
by
a
so
that
his
prognostic
was
very
dubious
meanwhile
he
applied
proper
dressings
to
both
and
in
half
an
hour
after
this
administration
the
gentleman
gave
some
tokens
of
perception
he
looked
around
him
with
a
wildness
of
fury
in
his
aspect
as
if
he
had
thought
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
robbers
by
whom
he
had
been
attacked
but
when
he
saw
the
assiduity
with
which
the
bystanders
exerted
themselves
in
his
behalf
one
raising
his
head
from
the
pillow
while
another
exhorted
him
to
swallow
a
little
wine
which
was
warmed
for
the
purpose
when
he
beheld
the
sympathising
looks
of
all
present
and
heard
himself
accosted
in
the
most
cordial
terms
by
the
person
whom
he
recollected
as
his
deliverer
all
the
severity
vanished
from
his
countenance
he
took
renaldo
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
praised
be
god
said
he
that
virtue
and
generosity
are
still
to
be
found
among
the
sons
of
everybody
in
the
apartment
was
affected
by
this
exclamation
and
melvil
above
all
the
rest
felt
such
emotions
as
he
could
scarcely
restrain
he
entreated
the
gentleman
to
believe
himself
in
the
midst
of
such
friends
as
would
effectually
secure
him
from
all
violence
and
mortification
he
conjured
him
to
compose
the
perturbation
of
his
spirits
and
quiet
the
apprehensions
of
his
mind
with
that
reflection
and
protested
that
he
himself
would
not
quit
the
house
while
his
attendance
should
be
deemed
necessary
for
the
stranger
cure
or
his
conversation
conducive
to
his
amusement
these
assurances
considered
with
the
heroic
part
which
the
young
hungarian
had
already
acted
in
his
behalf
inspired
the
cavalier
with
such
a
sublime
idea
of
melvil
that
he
gazed
upon
him
with
silent
astonishment
as
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
for
his
succour
and
in
the
transport
of
his
gratitude
could
not
help
exclaiming
sure
providence
hath
still
something
in
reserve
for
this
unfortunate
wretch
in
whose
favour
such
a
miracle
of
courage
and
generosity
hath
interposed
being
accommodated
with
proper
care
and
attendance
his
constitution
in
a
little
time
overcame
the
fever
and
at
the
third
dressing
the
surgeon
declared
him
out
of
all
danger
from
his
wounds
then
was
renaldo
indulged
with
opportunities
of
conversing
with
the
patient
and
of
inquiring
into
the
particulars
of
his
fortune
and
designs
in
life
with
a
view
to
manifest
the
inclination
he
felt
to
serve
him
in
his
future
occasions
the
more
this
stranger
contemplated
the
character
of
the
count
the
more
his
amazement
increased
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
benevolence
in
favour
of
a
person
whose
merit
he
could
not
possibly
know
he
even
expressed
his
surprise
on
this
subject
to
renaldo
who
at
length
told
him
that
although
his
best
offices
should
always
be
ready
for
the
occasions
of
any
gentleman
in
distress
his
particular
attachment
and
regard
to
him
was
improved
by
an
additional
consideration
i
am
no
stranger
said
he
to
the
virtues
and
honour
of
the
gallant
don
diego
de
heaven
and
earth
cried
the
stranger
starting
from
his
seat
with
extreme
emotion
do
i
then
live
to
hear
myself
addressed
by
that
appellation
my
heart
glows
at
the
expression
my
spirits
are
kindled
with
a
flame
that
thrills
through
every
nerve
say
young
gentleman
if
you
are
really
an
inhabitant
of
earth
by
what
means
are
you
acquainted
with
the
unhappy
name
of
zelos
in
answer
to
this
eager
interrogation
renaldo
gave
him
to
understand
that
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
had
resided
a
short
time
at
seville
where
he
had
frequently
seen
don
diego
and
often
heard
his
character
mentioned
with
uncommon
esteem
and
veneration
alas
replied
the
castilian
that
justice
is
no
longer
done
to
the
wretched
zelos
his
honours
are
blasted
and
his
reputation
by
the
venomous
tooth
of
he
then
proceeded
to
unfold
his
misfortunes
as
they
have
already
been
explained
in
the
former
part
of
these
memoirs
at
the
recapitulation
of
which
the
heart
of
melvil
being
intendered
by
his
own
calamities
was
so
deeply
affected
that
he
the
groans
of
don
diego
and
wept
over
his
sufferings
with
the
most
filial
sympathy
when
he
repeated
the
story
of
that
cruel
fraud
which
was
practised
upon
him
by
the
faithless
fadini
melvil
whose
mind
and
imagination
teemed
with
the
villanies
of
fathom
was
immediately
struck
with
the
conjecture
of
his
being
the
knave
because
indeed
he
could
not
believe
that
any
other
person
was
so
abandoned
by
principle
and
humanity
as
to
take
such
a
barbarous
advantage
of
a
gentleman
in
distress
chapter
his
return
to
england
and
midnight
pilgrimage
to
monimia
tomb
he
considered
the
date
of
that
unparalleled
transaction
which
agreed
with
his
conjecture
and
from
the
inquiries
he
made
concerning
the
person
of
the
traitor
gathered
reasons
sufficient
to
confirm
his
supposition
thus
certified
that
is
the
villain
cried
the
count
whose
infernal
arts
have
overwhelmed
me
with
such
misery
as
heaven
itself
hath
made
no
remedy
to
dispel
to
revenge
my
wrongs
on
that
perfidious
miscreant
is
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
which
i
deign
to
drag
about
an
hateful
being
o
don
diego
what
is
life
when
all
its
enjoyments
are
so
easily
poisoned
by
the
machinations
of
such
a
worm
so
saying
he
smote
his
breast
in
all
the
agony
of
woe
and
besought
the
spaniard
to
relate
the
steps
he
took
in
consequence
of
this
disaster
the
castilian
cheeks
reddened
at
this
information
which
enforced
his
own
resentment
and
casting
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
sacred
powers
cried
he
let
him
not
perish
before
you
bring
him
within
my
reach
you
ask
me
noble
cavalier
what
measures
i
took
in
this
abyss
of
misery
for
the
first
day
i
was
tortured
with
apprehensions
for
the
friendly
fadini
fearing
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
for
the
jewels
which
he
had
perhaps
too
unwarily
exposed
to
sale
but
this
terror
soon
vanished
before
the
true
presages
of
my
fate
when
on
the
morrow
i
found
the
whole
family
in
tears
and
confusion
and
heard
my
landlord
pour
forth
the
most
bitter
imprecations
against
the
fugitive
who
had
deflowered
his
daughter
and
even
robbed
the
house
you
will
ask
which
of
the
passions
of
my
heart
were
interested
on
this
occasion
they
were
shame
and
indignation
all
my
grief
flowed
in
another
channel
i
blushed
to
find
my
judgment
deceived
i
scorned
to
complain
but
in
my
heart
denounced
vengeance
against
my
base
betrayer
i
silently
retired
to
my
apartment
in
order
to
commune
with
my
own
thoughts
i
had
borne
greater
calamities
without
being
driven
to
despair
i
summoned
all
my
fortitude
to
my
assistance
and
resolved
to
live
in
spite
of
affliction
thus
determined
i
betook
myself
to
the
house
of
a
general
officer
whose
character
was
fair
in
the
world
and
having
obtained
admission
in
consequence
of
my
oriental
appearance
a
man
of
honour
said
i
unfortunate
need
no
introduction
my
habit
proclaims
me
a
persian
this
passport
from
the
states
of
holland
will
confirm
that
supposition
i
have
been
robbed
of
jewels
to
a
considerable
value
by
a
wretch
whom
i
favoured
with
my
confidence
and
now
reduced
to
extreme
indigence
i
come
to
offer
myself
as
a
soldier
in
the
armies
of
france
i
have
health
and
strength
sufficient
to
discharge
that
duty
nor
am
i
unacquainted
with
a
military
life
which
was
once
my
glory
and
occupation
i
therefore
sue
for
your
protection
that
i
may
be
received
though
in
the
lowest
order
of
them
that
serve
the
king
and
that
your
future
favour
may
depend
upon
my
behaviour
in
that
capacity
the
general
surprised
at
my
declaration
surveyed
me
with
uncommon
attention
he
perused
my
certificate
asked
divers
questions
concerning
the
art
of
war
to
which
i
returned
such
answers
as
convinced
him
that
i
was
not
wholly
ignorant
in
that
particular
in
short
i
was
enlisted
as
a
volunteer
in
his
own
regiment
and
soon
after
promoted
to
the
rank
of
a
subaltern
and
the
office
of
equerry
to
his
own
son
who
at
that
time
had
attained
to
the
degree
of
colonel
though
his
age
did
not
exceed
eighteen
years
this
young
man
was
naturally
of
a
ferocious
disposition
which
had
been
rendered
quite
untractable
by
the
pride
of
birth
and
fortune
together
with
the
licence
of
his
education
as
he
did
not
know
the
respect
due
to
a
gentleman
so
he
could
not
possibly
pay
it
to
those
who
were
unfortunately
under
his
command
divers
mortifications
i
sustained
with
that
fortitude
which
became
a
castilian
who
lay
under
obligations
to
the
father
till
at
length
laying
aside
all
decorum
he
smote
me
sacred
heaven
he
smote
don
diego
de
zelos
in
presence
of
his
whole
household
had
my
sword
been
endowed
with
sensation
it
would
of
itself
have
started
from
its
scabbard
at
this
indignity
offered
to
its
master
i
unsheathed
it
without
deliberation
saying
insolent
boy
he
is
a
gentleman
whom
thou
hast
outraged
and
thou
hast
thus
cancelled
the
ties
which
have
hitherto
restrained
my
indignation
his
servants
would
have
interposed
but
he
commanded
them
to
retire
and
flushed
with
that
confidence
which
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
inspired
he
drew
in
his
turn
and
attacked
me
with
redoubled
rage
but
his
dexterity
being
very
unequal
to
his
courage
he
was
soon
disarmed
and
overthrown
when
pointing
my
sword
to
his
breast
consideration
of
thy
youth
and
ignorance
said
i
spare
that
life
which
thou
hast
forfeited
by
thy
ungenerous
presumption
with
these
words
i
put
up
my
weapon
retired
through
the
midst
of
his
domestics
who
seeing
their
master
safe
did
not
think
proper
to
oppose
my
passage
and
mounting
my
horse
in
less
than
two
hours
entered
the
austrian
dominions
resolving
to
proceed
as
far
as
holland
that
i
might
embark
in
the
first
ship
for
spain
in
order
to
wash
away
with
my
own
blood
or
that
of
my
enemies
the
cruel
stain
which
hath
so
long
defiled
my
reputation
this
was
the
grievance
that
still
corroded
my
heart
and
rendered
ineffectual
the
inhuman
sacrifice
i
had
made
to
my
injured
honour
this
was
the
consideration
that
incessantly
prompted
and
still
importunes
me
to
run
every
risk
of
life
and
fortune
rather
than
leave
my
fame
under
such
an
ignominious
aspersion
i
purpose
to
obey
this
internal
call
i
am
apt
to
believe
it
is
the
voice
of
heaven
of
that
providence
which
manifested
its
care
by
sending
such
a
generous
auxiliary
to
my
aid
when
i
was
overpowered
by
banditti
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
having
in
this
manner
gratified
the
curiosity
of
his
deliverer
he
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
the
quality
of
him
to
whom
he
was
so
signally
obliged
and
renaldo
did
not
scruple
to
make
the
castilian
acquainted
with
his
name
and
family
he
likewise
communicated
the
story
of
his
unfortunate
love
with
all
the
symptoms
of
unutterable
woe
which
drew
tears
from
the
spaniard
while
with
a
groan
that
announced
the
load
which
overwhelmed
his
soul
i
had
a
daughter
said
he
such
as
you
describe
the
peerless
monimia
had
heaven
decreed
her
for
the
arms
of
such
a
lover
i
who
am
now
the
most
wretched
should
have
been
the
most
happy
parent
upon
thus
did
these
new
friends
alternately
indulge
their
mutual
sorrow
and
concert
measures
for
their
future
operations
melvil
earnestly
solicited
the
castilian
to
favour
him
with
his
company
to
england
where
in
all
probability
both
would
enjoy
the
gloomy
satisfaction
of
being
revenged
upon
their
common
betrayer
fathom
and
as
a
farther
inducement
he
assured
him
that
as
soon
as
he
should
have
accomplished
the
melancholy
purposes
of
his
voyage
he
would
accompany
don
diego
to
spain
and
employ
his
whole
interest
and
fortune
in
his
service
the
spaniard
thunderstruck
at
the
extravagant
generosity
of
this
proposal
could
scarce
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
and
after
some
pause
replied
my
duty
would
teach
me
to
obey
any
command
you
should
think
proper
to
impose
but
here
my
inclination
and
interest
are
so
agreeably
flattered
that
i
should
be
equally
ungrateful
and
unwise
in
pretending
to
comply
with
this
point
being
settled
they
moved
forwards
to
mons
as
soon
as
don
diego
was
in
a
condition
to
bear
the
shock
of
such
a
removal
and
there
remaining
until
his
wounds
were
perfectly
cured
they
hired
a
for
ostend
embarked
in
a
vessel
at
that
port
reached
the
opposite
shore
of
england
after
a
short
and
easy
passage
and
arrived
in
london
without
having
met
with
any
sinister
accident
on
the
road
as
they
approached
this
capital
renaldo
grief
seemed
to
regurgitate
with
redoubled
violence
his
memory
was
waked
to
the
most
minute
and
painful
exertion
of
its
faculties
his
imagination
teemed
with
the
most
afflicting
images
and
his
impatience
became
so
ardent
that
never
lover
panted
more
eagerly
for
the
consummation
of
his
wishes
than
melvil
for
an
opportunity
of
stretching
himself
upon
the
grave
of
the
lost
monimia
the
castilian
was
astonished
as
well
as
affected
at
the
poignancy
of
his
grief
which
as
a
proof
of
his
susceptibility
and
virtue
endeared
him
still
more
to
his
affection
and
though
his
own
misfortunes
had
rendered
him
very
unfit
for
the
office
of
a
comforter
he
endeavoured
by
soothing
discourse
to
moderate
the
excess
of
his
friend
affliction
though
it
was
dark
when
they
alighted
at
the
inn
melvil
ordered
a
coach
to
be
called
and
being
attended
by
the
spaniard
who
would
not
be
persuaded
to
quit
him
upon
such
an
occasion
he
repaired
to
the
house
of
the
generous
jew
whose
rheum
distilled
very
plentifully
at
his
approach
the
count
had
already
acquitted
himself
in
point
of
pecuniary
obligations
to
this
benevolent
hebrew
and
now
after
having
made
such
acknowledgments
as
might
be
expected
from
a
youth
of
his
disposition
he
begged
to
know
by
what
channel
he
had
received
that
letter
which
he
had
been
so
kind
as
to
forward
to
vienna
joshua
who
was
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
that
epistle
and
saw
the
young
gentleman
extremely
moved
would
have
eluded
his
inquiry
by
pretending
he
had
forgot
the
circumstance
but
when
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
case
which
was
not
explained
without
the
manifestation
of
the
utmost
inquietude
he
heartily
condoled
the
desponding
lover
telling
him
he
had
in
vain
employed
all
his
intelligence
about
that
unfortunate
beauty
in
consequence
of
melvil
letter
to
him
on
that
subject
and
then
directed
him
to
the
house
of
the
physician
who
had
brought
the
fatal
billet
which
had
made
him
miserable
no
sooner
did
he
receive
this
information
than
he
took
his
leave
abruptly
with
promise
of
returning
next
day
and
hied
him
to
the
lodgings
of
that
gentleman
whom
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
at
home
being
favoured
with
a
private
audience
when
i
tell
you
said
he
that
my
name
is
renaldo
count
de
melvil
you
will
know
me
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
by
that
letter
which
you
committed
to
the
charge
of
my
worthy
friend
joshua
the
fatal
veil
was
removed
from
my
eyes
which
had
been
so
long
darkened
by
the
artifices
of
incredible
deceit
and
my
own
incurable
misery
fully
presented
to
my
view
if
you
were
acquainted
with
the
unhappy
fair
who
hath
fallen
a
victim
to
my
mistake
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
insufferable
pangs
which
i
now
feel
in
recollecting
her
fate
if
you
have
compassion
for
these
pangs
you
will
not
refuse
to
conduct
me
to
the
spot
where
the
dear
remains
of
monimia
are
deposited
there
let
me
enjoy
a
full
banquet
of
woe
there
let
me
feast
that
worm
of
sorrow
that
preys
upon
my
heart
for
such
entertainment
have
i
revisited
this
to
me
isle
for
this
satisfaction
i
intrude
upon
your
condescension
at
these
unseasonable
hours
for
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
is
my
affliction
whetted
that
no
slumber
shall
assail
mine
eyelids
no
peace
reside
within
my
bosom
until
i
shall
have
adored
that
earthly
shrine
where
my
monimia
lies
yet
would
i
know
the
circumstances
of
her
fate
did
heaven
ordain
no
angel
to
minister
to
her
distress
were
her
last
moments
comfortless
ha
was
not
she
abandoned
to
indigence
to
insults
left
in
the
power
of
that
inhuman
villain
who
betrayed
us
both
sacred
heaven
why
did
providence
wink
at
the
triumph
of
such
consummate
perfidy
the
physician
having
listened
with
complacency
to
this
effusion
replied
it
is
my
profession
it
is
my
nature
to
sympathise
with
the
afflicted
i
am
a
judge
of
your
feelings
because
i
know
the
value
of
your
loss
i
attended
the
incomparable
monimia
in
her
last
illness
and
am
well
enough
acquainted
with
her
story
to
conclude
that
she
fell
a
sacrifice
to
an
unhappy
misunderstanding
effected
and
fomented
by
that
traitor
who
abused
your
mutual
he
then
proceeded
to
inform
him
of
all
the
particulars
which
we
have
already
recorded
touching
the
destiny
of
the
beauteous
orphan
and
concluded
with
telling
him
he
was
ready
to
yield
him
any
other
satisfaction
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
grant
the
circumstances
of
the
tale
had
put
renaldo
spirits
into
such
commotion
that
he
could
utter
nothing
but
interjections
and
unconnected
words
when
behaviour
was
described
he
trembled
with
fierce
agitation
started
from
his
chair
pronouncing
monster
fiend
but
we
shall
one
day
when
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
benevolence
of
the
french
lady
he
exclaimed
o
charity
and
compassion
sure
that
must
be
some
spirit
of
grace
sent
hither
to
mitigate
the
tortures
of
life
where
shall
i
find
her
to
offer
up
my
thanks
and
adoration
having
heard
the
conclusion
of
the
detail
he
embraced
the
relater
as
the
kind
benefactor
of
monimia
shed
a
flood
of
tears
in
his
bosom
and
pressed
him
to
crown
the
obligation
by
conducting
him
to
the
solitary
place
where
now
she
rested
from
all
her
cares
the
gentleman
perceiving
the
transports
of
his
grief
were
such
as
could
not
be
opposed
complied
with
his
request
attended
him
in
the
vehicle
and
directed
the
coachman
to
drive
to
a
sequestered
field
at
some
distance
from
the
city
where
stood
the
church
within
whose
awful
aisle
this
scene
was
to
be
acted
the
sexton
being
summoned
from
his
bed
produced
the
keys
in
consequence
of
a
gratification
after
the
physician
had
communed
with
him
apart
and
explained
the
intention
of
visit
during
this
pause
the
soul
of
melvil
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
sorrow
the
uncommon
darkness
of
the
night
the
solemn
silence
and
lonely
situation
of
the
place
conspired
with
the
occasion
of
his
coming
and
the
dismal
images
of
his
fancy
to
produce
a
real
rapture
of
gloomy
expectation
which
the
whole
world
would
not
have
persuaded
him
to
disappoint
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
owl
screeched
from
the
ruined
battlement
the
door
was
opened
by
the
sexton
who
by
the
light
of
a
glimmering
taper
conducted
the
despairing
lover
to
a
dreary
aisle
and
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
saying
here
the
young
lady
lies
melvil
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
than
falling
on
his
knees
and
pressing
his
lips
to
the
hallowed
earth
peace
cried
he
to
the
gentle
tenant
of
this
silent
then
turning
to
the
bystanders
with
a
bloodshot
eye
said
leave
me
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
this
occasion
my
grief
is
too
delicate
to
admit
the
company
even
of
my
friends
the
rites
to
be
performed
require
privacy
adieu
then
here
must
i
pass
the
night
the
doctor
alarmed
at
this
declaration
which
he
was
afraid
imported
some
resolution
fatal
to
his
own
life
began
to
repent
of
having
been
accessory
to
the
visit
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
and
finding
him
obstinately
determined
called
in
the
assistance
of
the
sexton
and
coachman
and
solicited
the
aid
of
don
diego
to
force
renaldo
from
the
execution
of
his
design
the
castilian
knowing
his
friend
was
then
very
unfit
for
common
altercation
interposed
in
the
dispute
saying
you
need
not
be
afraid
that
he
will
obey
the
dictates
of
despair
his
religion
his
honour
will
baffle
such
temptations
he
hath
promised
to
reserve
his
life
for
the
occasions
of
his
friend
and
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
his
present
in
order
to
corroborate
this
peremptory
address
which
was
delivered
in
the
french
language
he
unsheathed
his
sword
and
the
others
retreating
at
sight
of
his
weapon
count
said
he
enjoy
your
grief
in
full
transport
i
will
screen
you
from
interruption
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
and
while
you
give
a
loose
to
sorrow
within
the
ghastly
vault
i
will
watch
till
morning
in
the
porch
and
meditate
upon
the
ruin
of
my
own
family
and
he
accordingly
prevailed
upon
the
physician
to
retire
after
he
had
satisfied
the
sexton
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
return
by
break
of
day
renaldo
thus
left
alone
prostrated
himself
upon
the
grave
and
poured
forth
such
lamentations
as
would
have
drawn
tears
from
the
most
savage
hearer
he
called
aloud
upon
monimia
name
are
these
the
nuptial
joys
to
which
our
fate
hath
doomed
us
is
this
the
fruit
of
those
endearing
hopes
that
intercourse
divine
that
raptured
admiration
in
which
so
many
hours
insensibly
elapsed
where
now
are
those
attractions
to
which
i
yielded
up
my
captive
heart
quenched
are
those
genial
eyes
that
gladdened
each
beholder
and
shone
the
planets
of
my
happiness
and
peace
cold
cold
and
withered
are
those
lips
that
swelled
with
love
and
far
outblushed
the
damask
rose
and
ah
forever
silenced
is
that
tongue
whose
eloquence
had
power
to
lull
the
pangs
of
misery
and
care
no
more
shall
my
attention
be
ravished
with
the
music
of
that
voice
which
used
to
thrill
in
soft
vibrations
to
my
soul
o
sainted
spirit
o
unspotted
shade
of
her
whom
i
adored
of
her
whose
memory
i
shall
still
revere
with
sorrow
and
regret
of
her
whose
image
will
be
the
last
idea
that
forsakes
this
hapless
bosom
now
art
thou
conscious
of
my
integrity
and
love
now
dost
thou
behold
the
anguish
that
i
feel
if
the
pure
essence
of
thy
nature
will
permit
wilt
thou
ah
wilt
thou
indulge
this
wretched
youth
with
some
kind
signal
of
thy
notice
with
some
token
of
thy
approbation
wilt
thou
assume
a
medium
of
embodied
air
in
semblance
of
that
lovely
form
which
now
lies
mouldering
in
this
dreary
tomb
and
speak
the
words
of
peace
to
my
distempered
soul
return
monimia
appear
though
but
for
one
short
moment
to
my
longing
eyes
vouchsafe
one
smile
renaldo
will
be
satisfied
renaldo
heart
will
be
at
rest
his
grief
no
more
will
overflow
its
banks
but
glide
with
equal
current
to
his
latest
hour
alas
these
are
the
raving
of
my
delirious
sorrow
monimia
hears
not
my
complaints
her
soul
sublimed
far
far
above
all
sublunary
cares
enjoys
that
felicity
of
which
she
was
debarred
on
earth
in
vain
i
stretch
these
eyes
environed
with
darkness
undistinguishing
and
void
no
object
meets
my
view
no
sound
salutes
mine
ear
except
the
noisy
wind
that
whistles
through
these
vaulted
caves
of
in
this
kind
of
exclamation
did
renaldo
pass
the
night
not
without
a
certain
species
of
woful
enjoyment
which
the
soul
is
often
able
to
conjure
up
from
the
depths
of
distress
insomuch
that
when
the
morning
intruded
on
his
privacy
he
could
scarce
believe
it
was
the
light
of
day
so
fast
had
fleeted
the
minutes
of
his
devotion
his
heart
being
thus
disburdened
and
his
impatience
gratified
he
became
so
calm
and
composed
that
don
diego
was
equally
pleased
and
astonished
at
the
air
of
serenity
with
which
he
came
forth
and
embraced
him
with
warm
acknowledgments
of
his
goodness
and
attachment
he
frankly
owned
that
his
mind
was
now
more
at
ease
than
he
had
ever
found
it
since
he
first
received
the
fatal
intimation
of
his
loss
that
a
few
such
feasts
would
entirely
moderate
the
keen
appetite
of
his
sorrow
which
he
would
afterwards
feed
with
less
precipitation
he
also
imparted
to
the
castilian
the
plan
of
a
monument
which
he
had
designed
for
the
incomparable
monimia
and
don
diego
was
so
much
struck
with
the
description
that
he
solicited
his
advice
in
projecting
another
of
a
different
nature
to
be
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
own
wife
and
daughter
should
he
ever
be
able
to
himself
in
spain
chapter
he
renews
the
rites
of
sorrow
and
is
entranced
while
they
amused
themselves
with
this
sort
of
conversation
the
physician
returned
with
the
coach
and
accompanied
them
back
to
their
inn
where
he
left
them
to
their
repose
after
having
promised
to
call
again
at
noon
and
conduct
renaldo
to
the
house
of
madam
clement
the
benefactress
of
monimia
to
whom
he
eagerly
desired
to
be
introduced
the
appointment
was
observed
with
all
imaginable
punctuality
on
both
sides
melvil
had
arrayed
himself
in
a
suit
of
deep
mourning
and
he
found
the
good
lady
in
the
like
habit
assumed
upon
the
same
occasion
the
goodness
of
her
heart
was
manifest
in
her
countenance
the
sensibility
of
the
youth
discovered
itself
in
a
flood
of
tears
which
he
shed
at
her
appearance
his
sensations
were
too
full
for
utterance
nor
was
she
for
some
time
able
to
give
him
welcome
while
she
led
him
by
the
hand
to
a
seat
the
drops
of
sympathy
rushed
into
either
eye
and
at
length
she
broke
silence
saying
count
we
must
acquiesce
in
the
dispensations
of
providence
and
quiet
the
transports
of
our
grief
with
a
full
assurance
that
monimia
is
this
name
was
the
key
that
unlocked
the
faculty
of
his
speech
i
must
strive
said
he
to
ease
the
anguish
of
my
heart
with
that
consolation
but
say
humane
benevolent
lady
to
whose
compassion
and
generosity
that
hapless
orphan
was
indebted
for
the
last
peaceful
moment
she
enjoyed
upon
earth
say
in
all
your
acquaintance
with
human
nature
in
all
your
intercourse
with
the
daughters
of
men
in
all
the
exercise
of
your
charity
and
beneficence
did
you
ever
observe
such
sweetness
purity
and
truth
such
beauty
sense
and
perfection
as
that
which
was
the
inheritance
of
her
whose
fate
i
shall
for
ever
deplore
she
was
indeed
replied
the
lady
the
best
and
fairest
of
our
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
conversation
touching
that
lovely
victim
in
the
course
of
which
he
explained
those
wicked
arts
which
fathom
practised
to
alienate
his
affections
from
the
adorable
monimia
and
she
described
the
cunning
hints
and
false
insinuations
by
which
that
traitor
had
aspersed
the
unsuspecting
lover
and
soiled
his
character
in
the
opinion
of
the
virtuous
orphan
the
intelligence
he
obtained
on
this
occasion
added
indignation
to
his
grief
the
whole
mystery
of
behaviour
which
he
could
not
before
explain
now
stood
disclosed
before
him
he
saw
the
gradual
progress
of
that
infernal
plan
which
had
been
laid
for
their
mutual
ruin
and
his
soul
was
inflamed
with
such
desire
of
vengeance
that
he
would
have
taken
his
leave
abruptly
in
order
to
set
on
foot
an
immediate
inquiry
about
the
perfidious
author
of
his
wrongs
that
he
might
exterminate
such
a
monster
of
iniquity
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
he
was
restrained
by
madam
clement
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
fathom
was
already
overtaken
by
the
vengeance
of
heaven
for
she
had
traced
him
in
all
the
course
of
his
fortune
from
his
first
appearance
in
the
medical
sphere
to
his
total
eclipse
she
represented
the
villain
as
a
wretch
altogether
unworthy
of
his
attention
she
said
he
was
so
covered
with
infamy
that
no
person
could
enter
the
lists
against
him
without
bearing
away
some
stain
of
dishonour
that
he
was
at
present
peculiarly
protected
by
the
law
and
sheltered
from
the
resentment
of
renaldo
in
the
cavern
of
his
disgrace
melvil
glowing
with
rage
replied
that
he
was
a
venomous
serpent
which
it
was
incumbent
on
every
foot
to
crush
that
it
was
the
duty
of
every
man
to
contribute
his
whole
power
in
freeing
society
from
such
a
pernicious
hypocrite
and
that
if
such
instances
of
perfidy
and
ingratitude
were
suffered
to
pass
with
impunity
virtue
and
would
soon
be
expelled
from
the
habitations
of
men
over
and
above
these
motives
said
he
i
own
myself
so
vitiated
with
the
alloy
of
human
passion
and
infirmity
that
i
desire
i
eagerly
pant
for
an
occasion
of
meeting
him
hand
to
hand
where
i
may
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
and
shower
down
vengeance
and
destruction
on
his
perfidious
then
he
recounted
the
anecdotes
of
our
adventurer
which
he
had
learned
in
germany
and
flanders
and
concluded
with
declaring
his
unalterable
resolution
of
releasing
him
from
jail
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
sacrificing
him
with
his
own
hand
to
the
manes
of
monimia
the
discreet
lady
perceiving
the
perturbation
of
his
mind
would
not
further
combat
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
contenting
herself
with
exacting
a
promise
that
he
would
not
execute
his
purpose
until
he
should
have
deliberated
three
days
upon
the
consequences
by
which
a
step
of
that
kind
might
be
attended
before
the
expiration
of
that
term
she
thought
measures
might
be
taken
to
prevent
the
young
gentleman
from
exposing
his
life
or
reputation
to
unnecessary
hazard
having
complied
with
her
request
in
this
particular
he
took
his
leave
after
he
had
by
repeated
entreaties
prevailed
upon
her
to
accept
a
jewel
in
token
of
his
veneration
for
the
kind
benefactress
of
the
deceased
monimia
nor
could
his
generous
heart
be
satisfied
until
he
had
forced
a
considerable
present
on
the
humane
physician
who
had
attended
her
in
her
last
moments
and
now
discovered
a
particular
sympathy
and
concern
for
her
desponding
lover
this
gentleman
attended
him
to
the
house
of
the
benevolent
joshua
where
they
dined
and
where
don
diego
was
recommended
in
the
most
fervid
terms
of
friendship
to
the
good
offices
of
their
host
not
that
this
duty
was
performed
in
presence
of
the
stranger
renaldo
delicacy
would
not
expose
his
friend
to
such
a
situation
while
the
physician
before
dinner
entertained
that
stranger
in
one
apartment
melvil
withdrew
into
another
with
the
jew
to
whom
he
disclosed
the
affair
of
the
castilian
with
certain
circumstances
which
shall
in
due
time
be
revealed
joshua
curiosity
being
whetted
by
this
information
he
could
not
help
eyeing
the
spaniard
at
table
with
such
a
particular
stare
that
don
diego
perceived
his
attention
and
took
umbrage
at
the
freedom
of
his
regard
being
unable
to
conceal
his
displeasure
he
addressed
himself
to
the
hebrew
with
great
solemnity
in
the
spanish
tongue
saving
signior
is
there
any
singularity
in
my
appearance
or
do
you
recollect
the
features
of
don
diego
de
zelos
signior
don
diego
replied
the
other
in
pure
castilian
i
crave
your
pardon
for
the
rudeness
of
my
curiosity
which
prompted
me
to
survey
a
nobleman
whose
character
i
revere
and
to
whose
misfortunes
i
am
no
stranger
indeed
were
curiosity
alone
concerned
i
should
be
without
excuse
but
as
i
am
heartily
inclined
to
serve
you
as
far
as
my
weak
abilities
extend
i
hope
your
generosity
will
not
impute
any
little
involuntary
trespass
of
punctilio
to
my
want
of
cordiality
or
the
spaniard
was
not
only
appeased
by
this
apology
but
also
affected
with
the
compliment
and
the
language
in
which
it
was
conveyed
he
thanked
the
jew
for
his
kind
declaration
entreated
him
to
bear
with
the
peevishness
of
a
disposition
sore
with
the
galling
hand
of
affliction
and
turning
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
were
it
possible
cried
he
for
fate
to
reconcile
contradictions
and
recall
the
irremediable
current
of
events
i
would
now
believe
that
there
was
happiness
still
in
reserve
for
the
forlorn
zelos
now
that
i
tread
the
land
of
freedom
and
humanity
now
that
i
find
myself
befriended
by
the
most
generous
of
men
alas
i
ask
not
happiness
if
by
the
kind
endeavours
of
the
gallant
count
de
melvil
to
whom
i
am
already
indebted
for
my
life
and
by
the
efforts
of
his
friends
the
honour
of
my
name
shall
be
purified
and
cleared
from
the
poisonous
stains
of
malice
by
which
it
is
at
present
spotted
i
shall
then
enjoy
all
that
satisfaction
which
destiny
can
bestow
upon
a
wretch
whose
woes
are
renaldo
comforted
him
with
the
assurance
of
his
being
on
the
eve
of
triumphing
over
his
adversaries
and
joshua
confirmed
the
consolation
by
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
correspondents
in
spain
of
some
influence
in
the
state
that
he
had
already
written
to
them
on
the
subject
of
don
diego
in
consequence
of
a
letter
which
he
had
received
from
melvil
while
he
tarried
at
mons
and
that
he
every
post
expected
a
favourable
answer
on
that
subject
after
dinner
the
physician
took
his
leave
though
not
before
he
had
promised
to
meet
renaldo
at
night
and
accompany
him
in
the
repetition
of
his
midnight
visit
to
monimia
tomb
for
this
pilgrimage
the
unfortunate
youth
resolved
nightly
to
perform
during
the
whole
time
of
his
residence
in
england
it
was
indeed
a
sort
of
pleasure
the
prospect
of
which
enabled
him
to
bear
the
toil
of
living
through
the
day
though
his
patience
was
almost
quite
exhausted
before
the
hour
of
assignation
arrived
when
the
doctor
appeared
with
the
coach
he
leaped
into
it
with
great
eagerness
after
he
had
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
with
don
diego
to
stay
at
home
on
account
of
his
health
which
was
not
yet
perfectly
established
the
castilian
however
would
not
comply
with
his
request
until
he
had
obtained
the
count
promise
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
accompany
him
next
night
and
take
that
duty
alternately
with
the
physician
about
midnight
they
reached
the
place
where
they
found
the
sexton
in
waiting
according
to
the
orders
he
had
received
the
door
was
opened
the
mourner
conducted
to
the
tomb
and
left
as
before
to
the
gloom
of
his
own
meditations
again
he
laid
himself
on
the
cold
ground
again
he
renewed
his
lamentable
strain
his
imagination
began
to
be
heated
into
an
ecstasy
of
enthusiasm
during
which
he
again
fervently
invoked
the
spirit
of
his
deceased
monimia
in
the
midst
of
these
invocations
his
ear
was
suddenly
invaded
with
the
sound
of
some
few
solemn
notes
issuing
from
the
organ
which
seemed
to
feel
the
impulse
of
an
invisible
hand
at
this
awful
salutation
melvil
was
roused
to
the
keenest
sense
of
surprise
and
attention
reason
shrunk
before
the
thronging
ideas
of
his
fancy
which
represented
this
music
as
the
prelude
to
something
strange
and
supernatural
and
while
he
waited
for
the
sequel
the
place
was
suddenly
illuminated
and
each
surrounding
object
brought
under
the
cognisance
of
his
eye
what
passed
within
his
mind
on
this
occasion
is
not
easy
to
be
described
all
his
faculties
were
swallowed
up
by
those
of
seeing
and
hearing
he
had
mechanically
raised
himself
upon
one
knee
with
his
body
advancing
forwards
and
in
this
attitude
he
gazed
with
a
look
through
which
his
soul
seemed
eager
to
escape
to
his
view
thus
strained
upon
vacant
space
in
a
few
minutes
appeared
the
figure
of
a
woman
arrayed
in
white
with
a
veil
that
covered
her
face
and
flowed
down
upon
her
back
and
shoulders
the
phantom
approached
him
with
an
easy
step
and
lifting
up
her
veil
discovered
believe
it
o
reader
the
individual
countenance
of
monimia
at
sight
of
these
features
seemingly
improved
with
new
celestial
graces
the
youth
became
a
statue
expressing
amazement
love
and
awful
adoration
he
saw
the
apparition
smile
with
meek
benevolence
divine
compassion
warm
and
intendered
by
that
fond
pure
flame
which
death
could
not
extinguish
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
monimia
call
renaldo
thrice
he
essayed
to
answer
as
oft
his
tongue
denied
its
office
his
hair
stood
upright
and
a
cold
vapour
seemed
to
thrill
through
every
nerve
this
was
not
fear
but
the
infirmity
of
human
nature
oppressed
by
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
at
length
his
agony
was
overcome
he
recollected
all
his
resolution
and
in
a
strain
of
awestruck
rapture
thus
addressed
the
heavenly
visitant
hast
thou
then
heard
pure
spirit
the
wailings
of
my
grief
hast
thou
descended
from
the
realms
of
bliss
in
pity
to
my
woe
and
art
thou
come
to
speak
the
words
of
peace
to
my
desponding
soul
to
bid
the
wretched
smile
to
lift
the
load
of
misery
and
care
from
the
afflicted
breast
to
fill
thy
lover
heart
with
joy
and
pleasing
hope
was
still
the
darling
task
of
my
monimia
ere
yet
refined
to
that
perfection
which
mortality
can
never
attain
no
wonder
then
blessed
shade
that
now
when
reunited
to
thy
native
heaven
thou
art
still
kind
propitious
and
beneficent
to
us
who
groan
in
this
inhospitable
vale
of
sorrow
thou
hast
left
tell
me
ah
tell
me
dost
thou
still
remember
those
fond
hours
we
passed
together
doth
that
enlightened
bosom
feel
a
pang
of
soft
regret
when
thou
recallest
our
fatal
separation
sure
that
meekened
glance
bespeaks
thy
sympathy
ah
how
that
tender
look
me
sacred
heaven
the
pearly
drops
of
pity
trickle
down
thy
cheeks
such
are
the
tears
that
angels
shed
man
distress
turn
not
away
thou
beckonest
me
to
follow
yes
i
will
follow
thee
ethereal
spirit
as
far
as
these
weak
limbs
encumbered
with
mortality
will
bear
my
weight
and
would
to
heaven
i
could
with
ease
put
off
these
vile
corporeal
shackles
and
attend
thy
so
saying
he
started
from
the
ground
and
in
a
transport
of
eager
expectation
at
awful
distance
traced
the
footsteps
of
the
apparition
which
entering
a
detached
apartment
sunk
down
upon
a
chair
and
with
a
sigh
exclaimed
indeed
this
is
too
much
what
was
the
disorder
of
renaldo
mind
when
he
perceived
this
phenomenon
before
reflection
could
perform
its
office
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
sprung
forwards
crying
if
it
be
death
to
touch
thee
let
me
die
and
caught
in
his
arms
not
the
shadow
but
the
warm
substance
of
the
monimia
mysterious
powers
of
providence
this
is
no
phantom
this
is
no
shade
this
is
the
life
the
panting
bosom
of
her
whom
i
have
so
long
so
bitterly
deplored
i
fold
her
in
my
arms
i
press
her
glowing
breast
to
mine
i
see
her
blush
with
virtuous
pleasure
and
ingenuous
love
she
smiles
upon
me
with
enchanting
tenderness
o
let
me
gaze
on
that
transcendent
beauty
which
the
more
i
view
it
ravishes
the
more
these
charms
are
too
intense
i
sicken
while
i
gaze
merciful
heaven
is
not
this
a
mere
illusion
of
the
brain
was
she
not
fled
for
ever
had
not
the
cold
hand
of
death
divorced
her
from
my
hope
this
must
be
some
flattering
vision
of
my
distempered
fancy
perhaps
some
soothing
dream
if
such
it
be
grant
o
ye
heavenly
powers
that
i
may
never
o
gentle
youth
replied
the
beauteous
orphan
still
clasped
in
his
embrace
what
joy
now
fills
the
bosom
of
monimia
at
this
triumph
of
thy
virtue
and
thy
love
when
i
see
these
transports
of
thy
affection
when
i
find
thee
restored
to
that
place
in
my
esteem
and
admiration
which
thou
hadst
lost
by
the
arts
of
calumny
and
malice
this
is
a
meeting
which
my
most
sanguine
hopes
durst
not
presage
so
entirely
were
the
faculties
of
renaldo
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
restored
monimia
that
he
saw
not
the
rest
of
the
company
who
wept
with
transport
over
this
affecting
scene
he
was
therefore
amazed
at
the
interposition
of
madam
clement
who
while
the
shower
of
sympathetic
pleasure
bedewed
her
cheeks
congratulated
the
lovers
upon
this
happy
event
crying
these
are
the
joys
which
virtue
calls
her
they
also
received
the
compliments
of
a
reverend
clergyman
who
told
monimia
she
had
reaped
at
last
the
fruits
of
that
pious
resignation
to
the
will
of
heaven
which
she
had
so
devoutly
practised
during
the
term
of
her
affliction
and
lastly
they
were
accosted
by
the
physician
who
was
not
quite
so
hackneyed
in
the
ways
of
death
or
so
callous
to
the
finer
sensations
of
the
soul
but
that
he
blubbered
plentifully
wile
he
petitioned
heaven
in
behalf
of
such
an
accomplished
and
deserving
pair
monimia
taking
madam
clement
by
the
hand
whatever
joy
said
she
renaldo
derives
from
this
occasion
is
owing
to
the
bounty
the
compassion
and
maternal
care
of
this
incomparable
lady
together
with
the
kind
admonitions
and
humanity
of
those
two
worthy
melvil
whose
passions
were
still
in
agitation
and
whose
mind
could
not
yet
digest
the
incidents
that
occurred
embraced
them
all
by
turns
but
like
the
faithful
needle
which
though
shaken
for
an
instant
from
its
poise
immediately
regains
its
true
direction
and
points
invariably
to
the
pole
he
soon
returned
to
his
monimia
again
he
held
her
in
his
arms
again
he
drank
enchantment
from
her
eyes
and
thus
poured
forth
the
effusions
of
his
soul
can
i
then
trust
the
evidence
of
sense
and
art
thou
really
to
my
wish
restored
never
o
never
did
thy
beauty
shine
with
such
bewitching
grace
as
that
which
now
confounds
and
captivates
my
view
sure
there
is
something
more
than
mortal
in
thy
looks
where
hast
thou
lived
where
borrowed
this
perfection
whence
art
thou
now
descended
oh
i
am
all
amazement
joy
and
fear
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
no
we
must
not
part
again
by
this
warm
kiss
a
thousand
times
more
sweet
than
all
the
fragrance
of
the
east
we
nevermore
will
part
o
this
is
rapture
ecstasy
and
what
no
language
can
explain
in
the
midst
of
these
ejaculations
he
ravished
a
banquet
from
her
glowing
lips
that
kindled
in
his
heart
a
flame
which
rushed
through
every
vein
and
glided
to
his
marrow
this
was
a
privilege
he
had
never
claimed
before
and
now
permitted
as
a
recompense
for
all
the
penance
he
had
suffered
nevertheless
the
cheeks
of
monimia
who
was
altogether
unaccustomed
to
such
familiarities
underwent
a
total
suffusion
and
madam
clement
discreetly
relieved
her
from
the
anxiety
of
her
situation
by
interfering
in
the
discourse
and
rallying
the
count
upon
his
endeavours
to
monopolise
such
a
branch
of
happiness
o
my
dear
lady
replied
renaldo
who
by
this
time
had
in
some
measure
recovered
his
recollection
forgive
the
wild
transports
of
a
fond
lover
who
hath
so
unexpectedly
retrieved
the
jewel
of
his
soul
yet
far
from
wishing
to
hoard
up
his
treasure
he
means
to
communicate
and
diffuse
his
happiness
to
all
his
friends
o
my
monimia
how
will
the
pleasure
of
this
hour
be
propagated
as
yet
thou
knowest
not
all
the
bliss
that
is
reserved
for
thy
enjoyment
meanwhile
i
long
to
learn
by
what
contrivance
this
happy
interview
hath
been
effected
still
am
i
ignorant
how
i
was
transported
into
this
apartment
from
the
lonely
vault
in
which
i
mourned
over
my
supposed
misfortune
chapter
the
mystery
unfolded
another
recognition
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
reader
could
not
foresee
the
french
lady
then
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
monimia
death
as
a
stratagem
she
had
concerted
with
the
clergyman
and
doctor
in
order
to
defeat
the
pernicious
designs
of
fathom
who
seemed
determined
to
support
his
false
pretensions
by
dint
of
perjury
and
fraud
which
they
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
elude
she
observed
that
the
physician
had
actually
despaired
of
monimia
life
and
it
was
not
till
after
she
herself
was
made
acquainted
with
the
prognostic
that
she
wrote
the
letter
to
renaldo
which
she
committed
to
the
care
of
madam
clement
with
an
earnest
entreaty
that
it
should
not
be
sent
till
after
her
decease
but
that
lady
believing
the
count
had
been
certainly
abused
by
his
treacherous
confidant
despatched
the
billet
without
the
knowledge
of
monimia
whose
health
was
restored
by
the
indefatigable
care
of
the
physician
and
the
sage
exhortations
of
the
clergyman
by
which
she
was
reconciled
to
life
in
a
word
the
villany
of
fathom
had
inspired
her
with
some
faint
hope
that
renaldo
might
still
be
innocent
and
that
notion
contributed
not
a
little
to
her
cure
the
letter
having
so
effectually
answered
their
warmest
hopes
in
bringing
back
renaldo
such
a
pattern
of
constancy
and
love
the
confederates
in
consequence
of
his
enthusiastic
sorrow
had
planned
this
meeting
as
the
most
interesting
way
of
restoring
two
virtuous
lovers
to
the
arms
of
each
other
for
which
purpose
the
good
clergyman
had
pitched
upon
his
own
church
and
indulged
them
with
the
use
of
the
vestry
in
which
they
now
were
presented
with
a
small
but
elegant
collation
melvil
heard
this
succinct
detail
with
equal
joy
and
admiration
he
poured
forth
the
dictates
of
his
gratitude
to
the
preservers
of
his
this
church
said
he
shall
henceforth
possess
a
double
share
of
my
veneration
this
holy
man
will
i
hope
finish
the
charitable
work
he
has
begun
by
tying
those
bands
of
our
happiness
which
nought
but
death
shall
have
power
to
then
turning
to
that
object
which
was
the
star
of
his
regard
do
i
not
overrate
said
he
my
interest
with
the
fair
monimia
she
made
no
verbal
reply
but
answered
by
an
emphatic
glance
more
eloquent
than
all
the
power
of
rhetoric
and
speech
this
language
which
is
universal
in
the
world
of
love
he
perfectly
well
understood
and
in
token
of
that
faculty
sealed
the
assent
which
she
had
smiled
with
a
kiss
imprinted
on
her
polished
forehead
in
order
to
dissipate
these
interesting
ideas
which
by
being
too
long
indulged
might
have
endangered
his
reason
madam
clement
entreated
him
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
detail
of
what
had
happened
to
him
in
his
last
journey
to
the
empire
and
monimia
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
in
particular
the
issue
of
his
contest
with
count
trebasi
who
she
knew
had
usurped
the
succession
of
his
father
thus
solicited
he
could
not
refuse
to
gratify
their
curiosity
and
concern
he
explained
his
obligations
to
the
benevolent
jew
related
the
steps
he
had
taken
at
vienna
for
the
recovery
of
his
inheritance
informed
them
of
his
happy
rencontre
with
his
of
his
sister
deliverance
and
marriage
of
the
danger
into
which
his
life
had
been
precipitated
by
the
news
of
monimia
death
and
lastly
of
his
adventure
with
the
banditti
in
favour
of
a
gentleman
who
he
afterwards
understood
had
been
robbed
in
the
most
base
and
barbarous
manner
by
fathom
he
likewise
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
and
of
his
mistress
in
particular
communicated
some
circumstances
which
shall
appear
in
due
season
monimia
tender
frame
being
quite
fatigued
with
the
scene
she
had
acted
and
her
mind
overwhelmed
with
the
prosperous
tidings
she
had
heard
after
having
joined
the
congratulations
of
the
company
on
the
good
fortune
of
her
renaldo
begged
leave
to
retire
that
she
might
by
repose
recruit
her
exhausted
spirits
and
the
night
being
pretty
far
spent
she
was
conducted
by
her
lover
to
madam
clement
coach
that
stood
in
waiting
in
which
also
the
rest
of
the
company
made
shift
to
embark
and
were
carried
to
the
house
of
that
good
lady
where
after
they
were
invited
to
dine
and
melvil
entreated
to
bring
don
diego
and
the
jew
along
with
them
they
took
leave
of
one
another
and
retired
to
their
respective
lodgings
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
satisfaction
as
for
renaldo
his
rapture
was
still
mixed
with
apprehension
that
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
was
no
more
than
an
unsubstantial
vision
raised
by
some
gay
delirium
of
a
disordered
imagination
while
his
breast
underwent
those
violent
though
blissful
emotions
of
joy
and
admiration
his
friend
the
castilian
spent
the
night
in
ruminating
over
his
own
calamities
and
in
a
serious
and
severe
review
of
his
own
conduct
he
compared
his
own
behaviour
with
that
of
the
young
hungarian
and
found
himself
so
light
in
the
scale
that
he
smote
his
breast
with
violence
exclaiming
in
an
agony
of
remorse
count
melvil
has
reason
to
grieve
don
diego
to
despair
his
misfortunes
flow
from
the
villany
of
mankind
mine
are
the
fruit
of
my
own
madness
he
laments
the
loss
of
a
mistress
who
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
perfidious
arts
of
a
crafty
traitor
she
was
beautiful
virtuous
accomplished
and
affectionate
he
was
fraught
with
sensibility
and
love
doubtless
his
heart
must
have
deeply
suffered
his
behaviour
denotes
the
keenness
of
his
woe
his
eyes
are
everflowing
fountains
of
tears
his
bosom
the
habitation
of
sighs
five
hundred
leagues
hath
he
measured
in
a
pilgrimage
to
her
tomb
nightly
he
visits
the
dreary
vault
where
she
now
lies
at
rest
her
solitary
grave
is
his
couch
he
converses
with
darkness
and
the
dead
until
each
lonely
aisle
his
distress
what
would
be
his
penance
had
he
my
cause
were
he
conscious
of
having
murdered
a
beloved
wife
and
darling
daughter
ah
wretch
ah
cruel
homicide
what
had
those
dear
victims
done
to
merit
such
a
fate
were
they
not
ever
gentle
and
obedient
ever
aiming
to
give
thee
satisfaction
and
delight
say
that
serafina
was
enamoured
of
a
peasant
say
that
she
had
degenerated
from
the
honour
of
her
race
the
inclinations
are
involuntary
perhaps
that
stranger
was
her
equal
in
pedigree
and
worth
had
they
been
fairly
questioned
they
might
have
justified
at
least
excused
that
conduct
which
appeared
so
criminal
or
had
they
owned
the
offence
and
supplicated
pardon
o
barbarous
monster
that
i
am
was
all
the
husband
was
all
the
father
extinguished
in
my
heart
how
shall
my
own
errors
be
forgiven
if
i
refused
to
pardon
the
frailties
of
my
own
blood
of
those
who
are
most
dear
to
my
affection
yet
nature
pleaded
strongly
in
their
behalf
my
heart
was
bursting
while
i
dismissed
them
to
the
shades
of
death
i
was
maddened
with
revenge
i
was
guided
by
that
savage
principle
which
falsely
we
call
honour
accursed
phantom
that
assumes
the
specious
title
and
misleads
our
wretched
nation
is
it
then
honourable
to
skulk
like
an
assassin
and
plunge
the
secret
dagger
in
the
heart
of
some
unhappy
man
who
hath
incurred
my
groundless
jealousy
or
suspicion
without
indulging
him
with
that
opportunity
which
the
worst
criminal
enjoys
or
is
it
honourable
to
poison
two
defenceless
women
a
tender
wife
an
amiable
daughter
whom
even
a
frown
would
almost
have
destroyed
o
this
is
cowardice
brutality
fury
and
revenge
heaven
hath
not

to
forgive
such
execrable
guilt
who
gave
thee
power

ruffian
over
the
lives
of
those
whom
god
hath
stationed
as
thy
fellows
of
probation
over
those
whom
he
had
sent
to
comfort
and
assist
thee
to
sweeten
all
thy
cares
and
smooth
the
rough
uneven
paths
of
life
o
i
am
doomed
to
horror
and
remorse
if
misery
can
atone
for
such
enormous
guilt
i
have
felt
it
in
the
extreme
like
an
undying
vulture
it
preys
upon
my
heart
to
sorrow
i
am
wedded
i
hug
that
teeming
consort
to
my
soul
never
ah
never
shall
we
part
for
soon
as
my
fame
shall
shine
unclouded
by
the
charge
of
treason
that
now
hangs
over
it
i
will
devote
myself
to
penitence
and
woe
a
cold
damp
pavement
shall
be
my
bed
my
raiment
shall
be
sackcloth
the
fields
shall
furnish
herbage
for
my
food
the
stream
shall
quench
my
thirst
the
minutes
shall
be
numbered
by
my
groans
the
night
be
privy
to
my
strains
of
sorrow
till
heaven
in
pity
to
my
sufferings
release
me
from
the
penance
i
endure
perhaps
the
saints
whom
i
have
murdered
will
intercede
for
my
such
was
the
exercise
of
grief
in
which
the
hapless
castilian
consumed
the
night
he
had
not
yet
consigned
himself
to
rest
when
renaldo
entering
his
chamber
displayed
such
a
gleam
of
wildness
and
rapture
on
his
countenance
as
overwhelmed
him
with
amazement
for
till
that
moment
he
had
never
seen
his
visage
unobscured
with
woe
pardon
this
abrupt
intrusion
my
friend
cried
melvil
i
could
no
longer
withhold
from
your
participation
the
great
the
unexpected
turn
which
hath
this
night
dispelled
all
my
sorrows
and
restored
me
to
the
fruition
of
ineffable
joy
monimia
lives
the
fair
the
tender
the
virtuous
monimia
lives
and
smiles
upon
my
vows
this
night
i
retrieved
her
from
the
grave
i
held
her
in
these
arms
i
pressed
her
warm
delicious
lips
to
mine
oh
i
am
giddy
with
intolerable
pleasure
don
diego
was
confounded
at
this
declaration
which
he
considered
as
the
effects
of
a
disordered
brain
he
never
doubted
that
renaldo
grief
had
at
length
overpowered
his
reason
and
that
his
words
were
the
effects
of
mere
frenzy
while
he
mused
on
this
melancholy
subject
the
count
composed
his
features
and
in
a
succinct
and
detail
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
his
happiness
to
the
inexpressible
astonishment
of
the
spaniard
who
shed
tears
of
satisfaction
and
straining
the
hungarian
to
his
breast
o
my
son
said
he
you
see
what
recompense
heaven
hath
in
store
for
those
who
pursue
the
paths
of
real
virtue
those
paths
from
which
i
myself
have
been
fatally
misled
by
a
faithless
vapour
which
hath
seduced
my
steps
and
left
me
darkling
in
the
abyss
of
wretchedness
such
as
you
describe
this
happy
fair
was
once
my
serafina
rich
in
every
grace
of
mind
and
body
which
nature
could
bestow
had
it
pleased
heaven
to
bless
her
with
a
lover
like
renaldo
but
no
more
the
irrevocable
shaft
is
fled
i
will
not
taint
your
enjoyment
with
my
unavailing
sighs
melvil
assured
this
disconsolate
father
that
no
pleasure
no
avocation
should
ever
so
entirely
engross
his
mind
but
that
he
should
still
find
an
hour
for
sympathy
and
friendship
he
communicated
the
invitation
of
madam
clement
and
insisted
upon
his
compliance
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
approving
the
object
of
his
passion
i
can
refuse
nothing
to
the
request
of
count
de
melvil
replied
the
spaniard
and
it
were
ungrateful
in
me
to
decline
the
honour
you
propose
i
own
myself
inflamed
with
a
desire
of
beholding
a
young
lady
whose
perfections
i
have
seen
reflected
in
your
sorrow
my
curiosity
is
moreover
interested
on
account
of
that
humane
gentlewoman
whose
uncommon
generosity
sheltered
such
virtue
in
distress
but
my
disposition
is
infectious
and
will
i
am
afraid
hang
like
a
damp
upon
the
general
festivity
of
your
melvil
would
take
no
denial
and
having
obtained
his
consent
repaired
to
the
house
of
joshua
whose
countenance
seemed
to
unbend
gradually
into
a
total
expression
of
joy
and
surprise
as
he
learned
the
circumstances
of
this
amazing
event
he
faithfully
promised
to
attend
the
count
at
the
appointed
hour
and
in
the
meantime
earnestly
exhorted
him
to
take
some
repose
in
order
to
quiet
the
agitation
of
his
spirits
which
must
have
been
violently
hurried
on
this
occasion
the
advice
was
salutary
and
renaldo
resolved
to
follow
it
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
and
laid
himself
down
but
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
sleep
refused
to
visit
his
eyelids
all
his
faculties
being
kept
in
motion
by
the
ideas
that
crowded
so
fast
upon
his
imagination
nevertheless
though
his
mind
continued
in
agitation
his
body
was
refreshed
and
he
arose
in
the
forenoon
with
more
serenity
and
vigour
than
he
had
enjoyed
for
many
months
every
moment
his
heart
throbbed
with
new
rapture
when
he
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
possessing
all
that
his
soul
held
dear
and
amiable
he
put
on
his
gayest
looks
and
apparel
insisted
upon
the
castilian
doing
the
same
honour
to
the
occasion
and
the
alteration
of
dress
produced
such
an
advantageous
change
in
the
appearance
of
don
diego
that
when
joshua
arrived
at
the
appointed
hour
he
could
scarce
recognise
his
features
and
complimented
him
very
politely
on
the
improvement
of
his
looks
true
it
is
the
spaniard
was
a
personage
of
a
very
prepossessing
mien
and
noble
deportment
and
had
not
grief
by
increasing
his
native
gravity
in
some
measure
discomposed
the
symmetry
of
his
countenance
he
would
have
passed
for
a
man
of
a
very
amiable
and
engaging
physiognomy
they
set
out
in
the
jew
coach
for
the
house
of
madam
clement
and
were
ushered
into
an
apartment
where
they
found
the
clergyman
and
physician
with
that
lady
to
whom
don
diego
and
the
hebrew
were
by
melvil
introduced
before
they
had
seated
themselves
renaldo
inquired
about
the
health
of
monimia
and
was
directed
to
the
next
room
by
madam
clement
who
permitted
him
to
go
thither
and
conduct
her
to
the
company
he
was
not
slow
of
availing
himself
of
this
permission
he
disappeared
in
an
instant
and
during
his
short
absence
don
diego
was
strangely
disturbed
the
blood
flushed
and
forsook
his
cheeks
by
turns
a
cold
vapour
seemed
to
shiver
through
his
nerves
and
at
his
breast
he
felt
uncommon
palpitation
madam
clement
observed
his
discomposure
and
kindly
inquired
into
the
cause
when
he
replied
i
have
such
an
interest
in
what
concerns
the
count
de
melvil
and
my
imagination
is
so
much
prepossessed
with
the
perfections
of
monimia
that
i
am
as
it
were
agonised
with
expectation
yet
never
did
my
curiosity
before
raise
such
tumults
as
those
that
now
agitate
my
he
had
scarce
pronounced
these
words
when
the
door
reopening
renaldo
led
in
this
mirror
of
elegance
and
beauty
at
sight
of
whom
the
israelite
countenance
was
distorted
into
a
stare
of
admiration
but
if
such
was
the
astonishment
of
joshua
what
were
the
emotions
of
the
castilian
when
in
the
beauteous
orphan
he
beheld
the
individual
features
of
his
serafina
his
feelings
are
not
to
be
described
the
fond
parent
whose
affection
shoots
even
to
a
sense
of
pain
feels
not
half
such
transport
when
he
unexpectedly
retrieves
a
darling
child
from
the
engulfing
billows
or
devouring
flame
the
hope
of
zelos
had
been
totally
extinguished
his
heart
had
been
incessantly
torn
with
anguish
and
remorse
upbraiding
him
as
the
murderer
of
serafina
his
therefore
were
the
additional
transports
of
a
father
disburdened
of
the
guilt
of
such
enormous
homicide
his
nerves
were
too
much
overpowered
by
this
sudden
recognition
to
manifest
the
sensation
of
his
soul
by
external
signs
he
started
not
nor
did
he
lift
an
hand
in
token
of
surprise
he
moved
not
from
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
but
riveting
his
eyes
to
those
of
the
lovely
phantom
remained
without
motion
until
she
approaching
with
her
lover
fell
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
exclaimed
may
i
yet
call
you
father
this
powerful
shock
aroused
his
faculties
a
cold
sweat
bedewed
his
forehead
his
knees
began
to
totter
he
dropped
upon
the
floor
and
throwing
his
arms
around
her
cried
o
nature
o
serafina
merciful
providence
thy
ways
are
past
finding
so
saying
he
fell
upon
her
neck
and
wept
aloud
the
tears
of
sympathetic
joy
trickled
down
her
snowy
bosom
that
heaved
with
rapture
inexpressible
renaldo
eyes
poured
forth
the
briny
stream
the
cheeks
of
madam
clement
were
not
dry
in
this
conjuncture
she
kneeled
by
serafina
kissed
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
and
with
uplifted
hands
adored
the
power
that
preordained
this
blessed
event
the
clergyman
and
doctor
intimately
shared
the
general
transport
and
as
for
joshua
the
drops
of
true
benevolence
flowed
from
his
eyes
like
the
oil
on
aaron
beard
while
he
skipped
about
the
room
in
an
awkward
ecstasy
and
in
a
voice
resembling
the
hoarse
notes
of
the
tribe
cried
o
father
abraham
such
a
moving
scene
hath
not
been
acted
since
joseph
disclosed
himself
unto
his
brethren
in
don
diego
having
found
utterance
to
his
passion
proceeded
in
this
strain
o
my
dear
child
to
find
thee
thus
again
after
our
last
unhappy
parting
is
wonderful
miraculous
blessed
be
the
my
conscience
i
am
not
then
the
dire
assassin
who
sacrificed
his
wife
and
daughter
to
an
infernal
motive
falsely
titled
honour
though
i
am
more
and
more
involved
in
a
mystery
which
i
long
to
hear
that
shall
be
my
task
cried
renaldo
but
first
permit
me
to
implore
your
sanction
to
my
passion
for
the
incomparable
serafina
you
already
know
our
mutual
sentiments
and
though
i
own
the
possession
of
such
inestimable
worth
and
beauty
would
be
a
recompense
that
infinitely
transcends
the
merit
i
can
plead
yet
as
it
hath
been
my
good
fortune
to
inspire
her
with
a
mutual
flame
i
hope
to
reap
from
your
indulgence
here
what
i
could
not
expect
from
my
own
desert
and
we
present
ourselves
in
hope
of
your
paternal
assent
and
were
she
more
fair
and
good
and
gentle
than
she
is
answered
the
castilian
and
to
my
partial
observation
nought
appeared
on
earth
more
beauteous
and
engaging
i
would
approve
your
title
to
her
heart
and
recommend
you
to
her
smiles
with
all
a
father
influence
and
power
yes
my
daughter
my
joy
on
this
occasion
is
infinitely
augmented
by
the
knowledge
of
those
tender
ties
of
love
that
bind
thee
to
this
amiable
youth
a
youth
to
whose
uncommon
courage
and
generosity
i
owe
my
life
and
my
subsistence
together
with
the
inexpressible
delight
that
now
revels
in
my
bosom
enjoy
my
children
the
happy
fruits
of
your
reciprocal
attachment
may
heaven
which
hath
graciously
conducted
you
through
a
labyrinth
of
perplexity
and
woe
to
this
transporting
view
of
blissful
days
indulge
you
with
that
uninterrupted
stream
of
pure
felicity
which
is
the
hope
and
ought
to
be
the
boon
of
virtue
such
as
yours
so
saying
he
joined
their
hands
and
embraced
them
with
the
most
cordial
love
and
satisfaction
which
diffused
itself
to
every
individual
of
the
company
who
fervently
invoked
the
almighty
power
in
behalf
of
this
enraptured
pair
the
tumult
of
these
emotions
having
a
little
subsided
and
the
castilian
being
seated
betwixt
renaldo
and
his
beauteous
bride
he
politely
bespoke
the
indulgence
of
madam
clement
begging
she
would
permit
him
to
demand
the
performance
of
the
count
promise
that
he
might
be
forthwith
made
acquainted
with
those
circumstances
of
his
own
fate
which
he
was
so
impatient
to
learn
the
lady
having
assured
him
that
she
and
all
the
company
would
take
pleasure
in
hearing
the
recapitulation
the
spaniard
addressing
himself
to
melvil
in
the
name
of
heaven
said
he
how
could
you
supplant
that
rival
who
fell
a
sacrifice
to
my
resentment
after
he
had
bewitched
the
heart
of
serafina
for
sure
the
affection
he
had
kindled
in
her
breast
must
have
long
survived
his
death
that
rival
replied
the
count
who
incurred
your
displeasure
was
no
other
than
with
these
words
he
applied
to
one
eye
a
patch
of
black
silk
provided
for
the
purpose
and
turning
his
face
towards
don
diego
that
gentleman
started
with
astonishment
crying
good
heaven
the
very
countenance
of
orlando
whom
i
slew
this
is
still
more
amazing
chapter
a
retrospective
link
necessary
for
the
concatenation
of
these
memoirs
indulge
me
with
a
patient
hearing
proceeded
the
hungarian
and
all
these
riddles
soon
will
be
explained
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
foreign
countries
i
disobeyed
the
will
of
an
indulgent
father
from
whose
house
withdrawing
privately
i
set
out
for
italy
in
disguise
by
the
way
of
tyrol
visited
venice
rome
florence
and
embarking
at
naples
in
an
english
ship
arrived
at
lucar
from
whence
i
repaired
to
seville
there
in
a
few
days
was
my
curiosity
engaged
by
the
fame
of
the
fair
serafina
who
was
justly
deemed
the
most
accomplished
beauty
in
that
part
of
spain
nay
blush
not
gentle
creature
for
by
my
hopes
of
heaven
thy
charms
were
even
injured
by
the
cold
applause
of
that
report
nevertheless
i
was
warmly
interested
by
the
uncommon
character
and
eagerly
longed
to
see
this
pattern
of
perfection
as
don
diego
did
not
train
her
up
in
that
restraint
to
which
the
spanish
ladies
are
subjected
i
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
at
church
and
no
person
here
present
will
i
presume
doubt
but
that
i
was
instantly
captivated
by
her
beauty
and
deportment
had
i
thought
that
don
diego
favour
was
unengaged
perhaps
i
should
have
followed
the
dictates
of
vanity
and
inexperience
and
presented
myself
in
my
own
character
among
the
crowd
of
her
professed
admirers
i
knew
her
father
had
been
an
officer
of
distinguished
rank
and
reputation
and
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
have
regarded
a
young
soldier
of
unexceptionable
pedigree
and
i
will
even
add
of
untainted
fame
nor
did
i
suppose
my
own
father
could
have
objected
against
such
an
advantageous
match
but
by
dint
of
industrious
inquiry
i
learned
that
the
divine
serafina
was
already
betrothed
to
don
manuel
de
mendoza
and
this
information
overwhelmed
me
with
despair
after
having
revolved
a
thousand
projects
for
retarding
and
preventing
that
detested
union
i
resolved
to
avail
myself
of
my
talent
for
drawing
and
professed
myself
a
master
of
that
science
in
hope
of
being
employed
by
the
father
of
serafina
who
i
knew
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
improving
his
daughter
education
accordingly
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
his
notice
was
invited
to
his
house
honoured
with
his
approbation
and
furnished
with
unrestricted
opportunities
of
conversing
with
the
dear
object
of
my
love
the
passion
which
her
beauty
had
kindled
was
by
the
perfections
of
her
mind
inflamed
to
such
a
degree
of
transport
as
could
not
be
concealed
from
her
penetration
she
chanced
to
relish
my
conversation
i
gradually
acquired
her
friendship
pity
was
the
next
passion
that
she
entertained
in
my
favour
i
then
ventured
to
disclose
myself
and
the
dear
charmer
did
not
disapprove
of
my
presumption
she
and
her
mother
had
been
perplexed
with
some
religious
scruples
concerning
which
they
appealed
to
my
opinion
and
i
was
happy
enough
to
set
their
minds
at
ease
this
sort
of
intercourse
naturally
created
a
mutual
confidence
among
us
and
in
a
word
i
was
blessed
with
the
daughter
love
and
approbation
don
diego
will
pardon
these
clandestine
measures
which
we
took
from
a
full
persuasion
that
it
was
impossible
to
render
him
propitious
to
the
views
in
which
our
hearts
and
hands
were
so
deeply
interested
i
did
not
then
know
how
little
he
was
addicted
to
superstition
without
entering
into
a
detail
of
the
schemes
we
projected
to
delay
the
happiness
of
mendoza
i
shall
only
observe
that
knowing
the
fatal
day
was
at
length
unalterably
fixed
we
determined
to
elude
the
purpose
of
don
diego
by
flight
and
everything
was
actually
prepared
for
our
escape
when
the
hour
of
appointment
arrived
i
repaired
to
the
place
at
which
i
had
proposed
to
enter
the
house
and
stumbled
in
the
dark
over
the
body
of
a
man
still
warm
and
bleeding
alarmed
at
this
occurrence
i
darted
myself
through
the
window
and
rushing
to
the
apartment
of
the
ladies
immortal
powers
beheld
the
peerless
serafina
and
her
virtuous
mother
stretched
on
a
couch
and
in
all
appearance
deprived
of
life
the
company
will
easily
conceive
what
agonies
i
felt
at
such
a
spectacle
i
ran
towards
the
spot
in
a
transport
of
horror
i
clasped
my
lovely
mistress
in
my
arms
and
finding
her
still
breathing
endeavoured
but
in
vain
to
wake
her
from
the
trance
antonia
was
overwhelmed
with
the
same
lethargic
power
my
fancy
was
immediately
struck
with
the
apprehension
of
their
being
poisoned
regardless
of
my
own
situation
i
alarmed
the
family
called
for
assistance
and
requested
the
servants
to
summon
don
diego
to
the
dismal
scene
i
was
informed
that
their
master
had
rode
forth
in
manifest
confusion
and
while
i
pondered
on
this
surprising
excursion
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
entered
the
chamber
and
having
examined
the
pulses
of
the
ladies
declared
that
their
lives
were
in
no
danger
and
advised
that
they
should
be
undressed
and
conveyed
to
bed
while
their
women
were
busied
in
this
employment
i
went
into
the
attended
by
some
of
the
servants
with
lights
in
order
to
view
the
body
of
the
man
which
i
had
found
at
my
arrival
his
apparel
was
mean
his
countenance
ferocious
a
long
spado
was
buckled
to
his
thigh
and
in
his
belt
were
stuck
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
so
that
we
concluded
he
was
some
thief
who
had
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
seeing
the
casement
open
intended
to
rob
the
house
but
was
prevented
and
slain
by
don
diego
himself
whose
retreat
however
did
not
a
little
confound
our
conjecture
for
my
own
part
i
remained
all
night
in
the
house
tortured
with
fear
vexation
and
suspense
my
hope
was
altogether
disappointed
by
this
unhappy
accident
and
i
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
losing
serafina
for
ever
either
by
this
mysterious
malady
or
by
her
marriage
with
mendoza
which
i
now
despaired
of
being
able
to
defeat
the
having
waited
several
hours
for
his
lord
return
without
seeing
him
appear
thought
proper
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
don
manuel
with
an
account
of
what
had
happened
and
that
nobleman
arriving
in
the
morning
took
possession
of
the
house
about
four
in
the
afternoon
serafina
began
to
stir
and
at
five
she
and
her
mother
were
perfectly
awake
they
no
sooner
recovered
the
use
of
reflection
than
they
gave
signs
of
equal
sorrow
and
amazement
and
earnestly
called
for
isabella
who
was
privy
to
our
design
and
who
after
a
very
minute
inquiry
was
found
in
a
lone
and
solitary
chamber
where
she
had
been
confined
such
was
the
confusion
of
the
house
that
no
person
ever
dreamed
of
asking
how
i
entered
each
domestic
in
all
probability
supposing
i
had
been
introduced
by
his
fellow
so
that
i
tarried
unquestioned
on
pretence
of
concern
for
the
distress
of
a
family
in
which
i
had
been
so
generously
entertained
and
by
isabella
sent
my
respects
and
duty
to
her
ladies
she
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
when
after
every
other
servant
had
withdrawn
she
heard
the
lovely
serafina
exclaim
with
all
the
violence
of
grief
isabella
orlando
is
no
more
but
their
astonishment
was
still
greater
when
she
assured
them
of
my
being
alive
and
in
the
house
they
recounted
to
her
the
adventure
of
last
night
which
she
explained
by
informing
them
of
the
letters
which
don
diego
had
intercepted
and
they
immediately
concluded
that
he
had
in
the
precipitation
of
his
wrath
killed
by
mistake
the
person
who
was
found
dead
in
the
this
conjecture
alarmed
them
on
my
account
they
by
the
medium
of
isabella
conjured
me
to
leave
the
house
lest
don
diego
should
return
and
accomplish
his
resentment
and
i
was
persuaded
to
withdraw
after
i
had
settled
the
channel
of
a
correspondence
with
the
confidant
being
now
obliged
to
alter
our
measures
because
our
former
intention
was
discovered
by
don
diego
i
secured
a
retreat
for
serafina
and
her
mother
at
the
house
of
the
english
consul
in
seville
who
was
my
particular
friend
and
next
day
understanding
from
isabella
that
her
lord
had
not
yet
reappeared
and
that
don
manuel
was
very
urgent
in
his
addresses
we
concerted
an
assignation
in
the
garden
and
that
same
evening
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
convey
my
prize
to
the
asylum
i
had
prepared
for
their
reception
inexpressible
was
the
rage
of
mendoza
when
he
heard
of
their
elopement
he
raved
like
one
deprived
of
reason
swore
he
would
put
all
the
servants
of
the
family
to
the
rack
and
in
consequence
of
the
intelligence
he
obtained
by
threats
and
promises
set
on
foot
a
very
strict
inquiry
in
order
to
apprehend
the
fugitives
and
orlando
who
had
by
some
means
or
other
incurred
his
suspicion
we
eluded
his
search
by
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
our
kind
host
and
while
we
remained
in
concealment
were
extremely
astonished
to
hear
that
the
unfortunate
don
diego
was
proclaimed
a
traitor
and
a
price
set
upon
his
head
this
information
overwhelmed
us
all
with
the
utmost
affliction
antonia
lamented
without
ceasing
the
disgrace
of
her
beloved
lord
from
whom
she
never
would
have
withdrawn
herself
but
with
the
lively
hope
of
a
reconciliation
after
the
first
transports
of
his
ire
should
have
subsided
and
the
real
character
of
orlando
should
have
appeared
it
was
not
long
before
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
mendoza
was
the
accuser
of
don
diego
nay
start
not
signior
manuel
was
actually
that
traitor
this
was
the
turn
of
his
revenge
when
he
found
himself
disappointed
in
the
hope
of
possessing
the
incomparable
serafina
he
took
a
base
advantage
of
your
absence
and
retreat
he
posted
to
madrid
impeached
you
to
the
secretary
of
state
of
having
maintained
a
criminal
correspondence
with
the
enemies
of
spain
included
me
in
his
accusation
as
a
spy
for
the
house
of
austria
and
framed
such
a
plausible
tale
from
the
circumstances
of
your
distress
that
don
diego
was
outlawed
and
mendoza
gratified
with
a
grant
of
his
estate
these
melancholy
incidents
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
virtuous
antonia
who
waiving
every
other
consideration
would
have
personally
appeared
for
the
vindication
of
her
husband
honour
had
not
we
dissuaded
her
from
such
a
rash
undertaking
by
demonstrating
her
inability
to
contend
with
such
a
powerful
antagonist
and
representing
that
her
appearance
would
be
infallibly
attended
with
the
ruin
of
serafina
who
would
certainly
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
villain
to
whom
she
had
been
contracted
we
exhorted
her
to
wait
patiently
for
some
happy
revolution
of
fortune
and
encouraged
her
with
the
hope
of
don
diego
exerting
himself
effectually
in
his
own
defence
meanwhile
our
worthy
landlord
was
suddenly
cut
off
by
death
and
his
widow
being
resolved
to
retire
into
her
own
country
we
secretly
embarked
in
the
same
ship
and
arrived
in
england
about
eighteen
months
ago
antonia
still
continued
to
pine
over
the
ruin
of
her
house
as
she
could
hear
no
tidings
of
don
diego
she
concluded
he
was
dead
and
mourned
with
unabating
sorrow
in
vain
i
assured
her
that
soon
as
my
own
affairs
should
be
adjusted
i
would
exert
my
whole
endeavours
to
find
and
succour
him
she
could
not
imagine
that
a
man
of
his
spirit
and
disposition
would
live
so
long
in
obscurity
and
her
affliction
derived
new
force
from
the
death
of
the
consul
widow
with
whom
she
had
lived
in
the
most
unbounded
intimacy
and
friendship
from
that
day
her
health
evidently
declined
she
foresaw
her
dissolution
and
comforted
herself
with
the
hope
of
seeing
her
husband
and
her
friend
in
a
place
where
no
treachery
is
felt
and
no
sorrow
is
known
confident
of
my
integrity
and
the
purity
of
my
love
she
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
recommended
serafina
to
my
care
ha
weepest
thou
fair
excellence
at
the
remembrance
of
that
tender
scene
when
the
good
antonia
on
the
bed
of
death
joined
thy
soft
hand
to
mine
and
said
i
bequeath
this
orphan
to
your
love
it
is
a
sacred
pledge
which
if
you
cherish
with
due
honour
and
regard
internal
peace
and
happiness
will
ever
smile
within
your
bosom
but
if
you
treat
it
with
indifference
dishonour
or
neglect
just
heaven
will
punish
your
breach
of
trust
with
everlasting
disappointments
and
disquiet
signior
don
diego
i
see
you
are
moved
and
therefore
will
not
dwell
on
such
distressful
circumstances
the
excellent
antonia
exchanged
this
life
for
a
more
happy
state
and
so
exquisite
was
the
sorrow
of
the
serafina
as
to
torture
me
with
the
apprehension
that
she
would
not
long
survive
her
pious
mother
how
i
obeyed
the
injunctions
of
that
departing
saint
monimia
for
that
name
she
now
assumed
can
testify
until
that
artful
serpent
fathom
glided
into
our
mutual
confidence
abused
our
ears
poisoned
our
unsuspected
faith
and
effected
that
fatal
breach
productive
of
all
the
misery
and
vexation
which
we
have
suffered
and
which
is
now
so
happily
heaven
said
the
castilian
hath
visited
me
for
the
sins
and
errors
of
my
youth
yet
such
mercy
hath
been
mingled
with
its
chastisements
i
dare
not
murmur
or
repine
the
tears
of
penitence
and
sorrow
shall
water
my
antonia
grave
as
for
mendoza
i
rejoice
at
his
treachery
by
which
the
obligation
of
my
promise
is
cancelled
and
my
honour
fully
acquitted
he
shall
not
triumph
in
his
guilt
my
services
my
character
and
innocence
shall
soon
confront
his
perfidy
and
i
hope
defeat
his
interest
the
king
is
just
and
gracious
nor
is
my
family
and
name
here
the
jew
interposing
presented
to
him
a
letter
from
a
person
of
consequence
at
madrid
whom
joshua
had
interested
in
the
cause
of
don
diego
that
nobleman
had
already
found
means
to
represent
the
case
of
zelos
to
his
majesty
who
had
actually
ordered
don
manuel
to
be
confined
until
the
injured
person
should
appear
to
justify
himself
and
prosecute
his
accuser
according
to
the
terms
of
law
at
the
same
time
don
diego
was
summoned
to
present
himself
before
the
king
within
a
limited
time
to
answer
to
the
charge
which
mendoza
had
brought
against
him
the
spaniard
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
joy
when
he
read
this
intimation
he
embraced
the
jew
who
before
zelos
could
give
utterance
to
his
thoughts
told
him
that
the
spanish
ambassador
at
london
having
been
prepossessed
in
his
favour
craved
the
honour
of
seeing
don
diego
and
that
he
joshua
was
ready
to
conduct
him
to
the
house
then
is
my
heart
at
rest
cried
the
castilian
the
house
of
zelos
once
more
shall
lift
up
its
head
i
shall
again
revisit
my
native
country
with
honour
and
abase
the
villain
who
hath
soiled
my
fame
o
my
children
this
day
is
replete
with
such
joy
and
satisfaction
as
i
did
not
think
had
been
in
the
power
of
heaven
to
grant
without
the
interposition
of
a
miracle
to
you
renaldo
to
you
illustrious
lady
and
to
these
worthy
gentlemen
am
i
indebted
for
the
restoration
of
that
for
which
alone
i
wish
to
live
and
when
my
heart
ceases
to
retain
the
obligation
may
i
forfeit
the
name
of
a
castilian
and
scorn
and
dishonour
be
my
perhaps
all
europe
could
not
produce
another
company
so
happy
as
that
which
now
sat
down
to
dinner
in
the
house
of
madam
clement
whose
own
benevolent
heart
was
peculiarly
adapted
for
such
enjoyment
the
lovers
feasted
their
eyes
more
than
their
appetite
by
a
tender
intercourse
of
glances
which
needed
not
the
slow
interpretation
of
speech
while
the
spaniard
regarded
them
alternately
with
looks
of
wonder
and
paternal
joy
and
every
individual
surveyed
the
pair
with
admiration
and
esteem
serafina
taking
the
advantage
of
this
general
satisfaction
when
the
heart
softened
into
complacency
deposits
every
violent
thought
i
must
now
said
she
try
my
interest
with
renaldo
the
good
company
shall
bear
witness
to
my
triumph
or
repulse
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
but
to
withhold
your
vengeance
from
the
wretched
fathom
his
fraud
ingratitude
and
villany
are
i
believe
unrivalled
yet
his
base
designs
have
been
defeated
and
heaven
perhaps
hath
made
him
the
involuntary
instrument
for
bringing
our
constancy
and
virtue
to
the
test
besides
his
perfidy
is
already
punished
with
the
last
degree
of
human
misery
and
disgrace
the
doctor
who
has
traced
him
in
all
his
conduct
and
vicissitudes
of
fortune
will
draw
a
picture
of
his
present
wretchedness
which
i
doubt
not
will
move
your
compassion
as
it
hath
already
excited
the
generous
hostess
was
ready
to
enforce
this
charitable
proposal
with
all
her
eloquence
when
melvil
with
a
look
that
well
expressed
his
magnanimity
of
love
replied
such
a
boon
becomes
the
gentle
serafina
o
every
moment
furnishes
me
with
fresh
matter
to
admire
the
virtues
of
thy
soul
if
thou
whose
tender
heart
hath
been
so
rent
with
misery
and
anguish
canst
intercede
for
thy
tormentor
who
now
suffers
in
his
turn
shall
i
refuse
to
pardon
the
miserable
wretch
no
let
me
glory
in
imitating
the
great
example
and
solicit
don
diego
in
behalf
of
the
same
miscreant
whose
perfidious
barbarity
cost
him
such
intolerable
enough
cried
the
castilian
i
have
disclaimed
the
vindictive
principles
of
a
spaniard
and
leave
the
miserable
object
to
the
sting
of
his
own
conscience
which
soon
or
late
will
not
fail
to
avenge
the
wrongs
we
have
sustained
from
his
chapter
the
history
draws
near
a
period
universal
was
the
applause
which
they
acquired
by
this
noble
sacrifice
of
their
resentment
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
the
utmost
harmony
and
and
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
renaldo
whose
fancy
still
harboured
the
apprehensions
of
another
separation
don
diego
consented
that
the
indissoluble
knot
should
be
tied
between
that
young
gentleman
and
serafina
in
two
days
and
the
place
appointed
for
the
ceremony
was
the
very
church
where
they
had
been
restored
to
the
arms
of
each
other
the
lovely
bride
with
a
silent
blush
that
set
her
lover
heart
on
fire
submitted
to
this
determination
in
consequence
of
which
the
company
was
bespoke
for
that
auspicious
hour
and
the
evening
being
pretty
far
advanced
they
took
leave
of
the
ladies
and
retired
to
their
respective
homes
don
diego
and
his
future
being
reconducted
to
their
lodgings
in
the
coach
of
the
jew
who
taking
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
melvil
observed
that
it
would
be
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
supply
the
castilian
with
a
sum
of
money
in
order
to
support
his
dignity
and
independence
in
furnishing
serafina
with
everything
suitable
to
her
rank
and
merit
and
that
he
would
willingly
accommodate
him
provided
he
knew
how
to
propose
it
so
as
to
give
no
offence
to
his
punctilious
disposition
renaldo
thanking
him
for
this
generous
anticipation
advised
him
to
solicit
the
spaniard
correspondence
in
the
way
of
business
and
to
put
the
whole
on
the
footing
of
his
own
interest
by
which
means
don
delicacy
could
sustain
no
affront
fraught
with
this
instruction
the
israelite
desired
a
private
audience
of
the
castilian
in
which
after
an
apology
for
the
freedom
of
his
demand
signior
don
diego
said
he
as
your
fortune
hath
been
so
long
embezzled
by
your
adversary
in
spain
and
your
correspondence
with
that
country
entirely
cut
off
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
your
finances
are
at
present
in
such
a
condition
as
to
maintain
the
splendour
of
your
family
count
de
melvil
whole
fortune
is
at
your
command
and
had
not
he
been
afraid
of
giving
umbrage
to
the
peculiar
delicacy
of
your
sentiments

would
have
pressed
you
to
use
it
for
your
convenience
for
my
own
part
over
and
above
the
inclination
i
have
to
serve

i
consult
my

private
advantage
in
desiring

to
accept
my
service
on
this
occasion
money

the

commodity
in
which

and
if

honour

with
your
commands
i
shall
be
a
gainer
by

replied
with
a
smile
that
denoted
how
well
he
understood
the
meaning
of
this
address
surely
signior
i
am
bound
by
the
strongest
ties
to
exert
my
utmost
endeavours
for
your

and
i
pray
god
this

that
issue
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
count
generosity
and
refined
notions
of
honour
and
too
much
obliged
by
him
already
to
hesitate
with
punctilious
reserve
in
accepting
his
future
assistance
nevertheless
since
you
have
contrived
a
scheme
for
removing
all
scruples
of
that
sort
i
shall
execute
it
with
pleasure
and
in
the
form
of

you
shall
have
all
the
security
i
can
give
for
what
shall
be
necessary
to
answer
my
present
the
preliminaries
being
thus
settled
joshua
advanced
for
his
use
a
thousand
pounds
for
which
he
would
take
neither
bond
note
nor
receipt
desiring
only
that
the
castilian
would
mark
it
in
his
own
that
the
debt
might
appear
in
case
any
accident
should
befall
the
borrower
although
the
spaniard
had
been
accustomed
to
the
uncommon
generosity
of
melvil
he
could
not
help
wondering
at
this
nobleness
of
behaviour
so
little
to
be
expected
from
any
merchant
much
less
from
a
jewish
broker
while
this
affair
was
on
the
anvil
renaldo
who
could
no
longer
withhold
the
communication
of
his
happiness
from
his
sister
and
relations
in
germany
took
up
the
pen
and
in
a
letter
to
his
recounted
all
the
circumstances
of
the
surprising
turn
of
fate
which
he
had
experienced
since
his
arrival
in
england
he
likewise
related
the
story
of
don
diego
informed
them
of
the
day
appointed
for
his
nuptials
and
entreated
the
major
to
make
a
journey
to
london
with
his
wife
or
if
that
should
be
impracticable
to
come
as
far
as
brussels
where
they
should
be
met
by
him
and
his
serafina
there
was
now
but
one
day
between
him
and
the
accomplishment
of
his
dearest
wish
and
that
was
spent
in
procuring
a
licence
and
adjusting
the
preparations
for
the
grand
festival
don
diego
in
the
forenoon
visited
madam
clement
to
whom
he
repeated
his
warm
acknowledgments
of
her
bounty
and
maternal
affection
to
his
daughter
and
presented
to
serafina
bank
notes
to
the
amount
of
five
hundred
pounds
to
defray
the
necessary
expense
for
her
wedding
ornaments
all
the
previous
steps
being
taken
for
the
solemnisation
of
this
interesting
event
and
the
hour
of
appointment
arrived
the
bridegroom
accompanied
by
his
hastened
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
which
was
the
of
the
church
we
have
already
described
where
they
were
received
by
the
good
clergyman
in
his
canonicals
and
here
they
had
not
waited
many
minutes
when
they
were
joined
by
madam
clement
and
the
amiable
bride
escorted
by
the
friendly
physician
who
had
all
along
borne
such
a
share
in
their
concerns
serafina
was
dressed
in
a
sack
of
white
satin
and
the
ornaments
of
her
head
were
adjusted
in
the
spanish
fashion
which
gave
a
peculiar
air
to
her
appearance
and
an
additional
spirit
to
those
attractions
which
engaged
the
heart
of
each
beholder
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
habit
of
renaldo
who
had
copied
the
plainness
and
elegance
of
his
mistress
but
when
she
entered
the
place
his
features
were
animated
with
a
double
proportion
of
vivacity
and
their
eyes
meeting
seemed
to
kindle
a
blaze
which
diffused
warmth
and
joy
through
the
countenances
of
all
present
after
a
short
pause
her
father
led
her
to
the
altar
and
gave
her
away
to
the
transported
renaldo
before
the
priest
who
performed
the
ceremony
and
bestowed
the
nuptial
benediction
on
this
enraptured
pair
the
sanction
of
the
church
being
thus
obtained
they
withdrew
into
the
vestry
where
melvil
sealed
his
title
on
her
rosy
lips
and
presented
his
wife
to
the
company
who
embraced
her
in
their
turns
with
fervent
wishes
for
their
mutual
happiness
though
the
scene
of
this
transaction
was
remote
from
any
inhabited
neighbourhood
the
church
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
who
with
uncommon
demonstration
of
surprise
and
admiration
petitioned
heaven
to
bless
so
fair
a
couple
such
indeed
was
their
eagerness
to
see
them
that
some
lives
were
endangered
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
which
attended
them
with
loud
acclamations
to
the
coach
after
the
bridegroom
had
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
minister
one
hundred
pounds
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
of
that
parish
and
thrown
several
handfuls
of
money
among
the
multitude
serafina
in
madam
convenience
with
that
good
lady
and
don
diego
while
renaldo
with
the
clergyman
and
doctor
followed
in
joshua
coach
to
a
pleasant
upon
the
thames
at
a
distance
of
a
few
miles
from
london
this
the
jew
had
borrowed
from
the
owner
for
a
few
days
and
there
they
were
received
by
that
honest
hebrew
who
had
provided
a
very
elegant
entertainment
for
the
occasion
he
had
also
bespoke
a
small
but
excellent
band
of
music
which
regaled
their
ears
while
they
sat
at
dinner
and
the
afternoon
being
calm
and
serene
he
prevailed
on
them
to
take
the
air
on
the
river
in
a
barge
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
purpose
but
notwithstanding
this
diversity
of
amusement
renaldo
would
have
found
it
the
longest
day
he
had
ever
passed
had
not
his
imagination
been
diverted
by
an
incident
which
employed
his
attention
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
evening
they
had
drunk
tea
and
engaged
in
a
party
at
whist
when
they
were
surprised
with
a
noise
of
contention
from
a
that
fronted
the
windows
of
the
apartment
in
which
they
sat
alarmed
at
this
uproar
they
forsook
their
cards
and
throwing
up
the
casement
beheld
a
hearse
surrounded
by
four
men
on
horseback
who
had
stopped
the
carriage
and
violently
pulled
the
driver
from
his
seat
this
uncommon
arrest
had
engaged
the
curiosity
of
the
publican
family
who
stood
at
the
door
to
observe
the
consequence
when
all
of
a
sudden
appeared
a
person
in
canonicals
well
mounted
who
riding
up
to
those
who
maltreated
the
driver
bestowed
upon
one
of
them
such
a
blow
with
the
of
his
whip
as
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
ground
and
springing
from
his
saddle
upon
the
box
took
the
reins
into
his
own
hand
swearing
with
great
vehemence
that
he
would
murder
every
man
who
should
attempt
to
obstruct
the
hearse
the
good
priest
who
had
married
renaldo
was
not
a
little
scandalised
at
this
ferocious
behaviour
in
a
clergyman
and
could
not
help
saying
aloud
he
was
a
disgrace
to
the
cloth
when
the
horseman
looking
up
to
the
window
replied
sir
may
i
be
d
n
if
any
man
in
england
has
a
greater
respect
for
the
cloth
than
i
have
but
at
present
i
am
quite
so
saying
he
whipped
up
the
horses
and
had
actually
disentangled
the
hearse
from
those
who
surrounded
it
when
he
was
opposed
by
another
troop
one
of
whom
alighted
with
great
expedition
and
cut
the
harness
so
as
that
he
could
not
possibly
proceed
finding
himself
thus
driven
to
bay
he
leaped
upon
the
ground
and
exercised
his
weapon
with
such
amazing
strength
and
agility
that
several
of
his
antagonists
were
left
motionless
on
the
field
before
he
was
overpowered
and
disarmed
by
dint
of
numbers
who
assailed
him
on
all
sides
the
mad
parson
being
thus
taken
prisoner
an
elderly
person
of
a
very
prepossessing
appearance
went
up
to
the
hearse
and
unbolting
the
door
a
young
lady
sprung
out
and
shrieking
ran
directly
to
the
to
the
infinite
astonishment
and
affright
of
the
whole
family
who
believed
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
person
whose
body
lay
in
the
carriage
renaldo
who
was
with
difficulty
restrained
from
interposing
in
behalf
of
the
clergyman
against
such
odds
no
sooner
perceived
this
apparition
than
supposing
her
to
be
some
distressed
damsel
his
quixotism
awoke
he
descended
in
an
instant
and
rushed
into
the
house
among
those
that
pursued
the
fair
phantom
don
diego
and
the
physician
took
the
same
road
while
the
real
clergyman
and
joshua
tarried
with
the
ladies
who
were
by
this
time
very
much
interested
in
the
event
melvil
found
the
young
lady
in
the
hands
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
released
her
from
the
hearse
and
who
now
bitterly
upbraided
her
for
her
folly
and
disobedience
while
she
protested
with
great
vivacity
that
whatever
she
might
suffer
from
his
severity
she
would
never
submit
to
the
hateful
match
he
had
proposed
nor
break
the
promise
she
had
already
made
to
the
gentleman
who
now
attempted
to
rescue
her
from
the
tyranny
of
a
cruel
father
this
declaration
was
followed
by
a
plentiful
shower
of
tears
which
the
father
could
not
behold
with
unmoistened
eyes
although
he
reviled
her
with
marks
of
uncommon
displeasure
and
turning
to
the
count
i
appeal
to
you
sir
said
he
whether
i
have
not
reason
to
curse
the
undutiful
obstinacy
of
that
pert
baggage
and
renounce
her
for
ever
as
an
alien
to
my
blood
she
has
for
some
months
been
solicited
in
marriage
by
an
honest
citizen
a
thirty
thousand
pound
man
and
instead
of
listening
to
such
an
advantageous
proposal
she
hath
bestowed
her
heart
upon
a
young
fellow
not
worth
a
groat
ah
you
degenerate
hussy
this
comes
of
your
plays
and
romances
if
thy
mother
were
not
a
woman
of
an
unexceptionable
life
and
conversation
i
should
verily
believe
thou
art
no
child
of
mine
run
away
with
a
beggar
for
shame
i
suppose
replied
renaldo
the
person
to
whom
your
affection
inclines
is
that
clergyman
who
exerted
himself
so
manfully
at
the
door
clergyman
cried
the
other
adad
he
has
more
of
the
devil
than
the
church
about
him
a
ruffian
he
has
for
aught
i
know
murdered
the
worthy
gentleman
whom
i
intended
for
my
and
the
rogue
if
i
had
not
kept
out
of
his
way
would
i
suppose
have
served
me
with
the
same
sauce
me
who
have
been
his
master
for
many
years
and
had
resolved
to
make
a
man
of
him
sir
he
was
my
own
clerk
and
this
is
the
return
i
have
met
with
from
the
serpent
which
i
cherished
in
my
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
citizen
for
whom
he
had
expressed
such
concern
that
gentleman
had
received
a
contusion
upon
one
eye
by
which
the
sight
was
altogether
obstructed
so
that
he
concluded
he
should
never
retrieve
the
use
of
that
organ
and
with
great
clamour
took
all
the
spectators
to
witness
the
injury
he
had
sustained
he
entered
the
room
with
manifest
perturbation
demanded
satisfaction
of
the
father
and
peremptorily
declared
it
should
not
be
a
lost
eye
to
him
if
there
was
law
in
england
this
unseasonable
demand
and
the
boisterous
manner
in
which
it
was
made
did
not
at
all
suit
the
present
humour
of
the
old
gentleman
who
told
him
peevishly
he
owed
him
no
eye
and
bade
him
go
and
ask
reparation
of
the
person
who
had
done
him
wrong
the
young
lady
snatching
this
favourable
occasion
earnestly
entreated
melvil
and
his
company
to
intercede
with
her
father
in
behalf
of
her
lover
who
she
assured
them
was
a
young
gentleman
of
a
good
family
and
uncommon
merit
and
in
compliance
with
her
request
they
invited
him
and
his
daughter
to
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
where
they
would
be
disencumbered
of
the
crowd
which
this
dispute
had
gathered
together
and
more
at
leisure
to
consult
about
the
measures
necessary
to
be
taken
the
old
gentleman
thanked
them
for
their
courtesy
which
he
did
not
think
proper
to
refuse
and
while
he
led
or
rather
hauled
mademoiselle
over
the
way
under
the
auspices
of
the
castilian
renaldo
set
the
lover
at
liberty
made
him
a
tender
of
his
good
offices
and
advised
him
to
wait
at
the
for
an
happy
issue
of
their
negotiation
the
was
very
much
affected
by
this
generous
proffer
for
which
he
made
suitable
acknowledgments
and
protested
before
god
he
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
part
with
his
dear
charlotte
her
father
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
than
he
was
known
by
joshua
to
be
a
considerable
trader
in
the
city
of
london
and
the
merchant
was
glad
to
find
himself
among
his
acquaintance
he
was
so
full
of
the
story
which
had
brought
him
thither
that
he
had
scarce
sat
down
when
he
began
to
complain
of
his
hard
fate
in
having
an
only
child
who
was
so
mean
stubborn
and
contumacious
and
every
sentence
was
concluded
with
an
apostrophe
of
reproaches
to
the
delinquent
the
jew
having
allowed
him
to
ring
out
his
alarm
condoled
his
misfortune
and
gravely
counselled
the
young
lady
to
wean
her
affections
from
such
an
unworthy
object
for
he
supposed
her
favourite
was
a
man
of
no
principle
or
liberal
endowments
otherwise
her
father
would
not
exclaim
so
bitterly
against
her
conduct
charlotte
who
wanted
neither
beauty
nor
understanding
assured
him
that
her
lover
character
was
in
all
respects
unblemished
for
the
truth
of
which
assertion
she
appealed
to
her
papa
who
owned
with
reluctance
that
the
young
man
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
that
he
had
served
him
with
remarkable
diligence
and
integrity
and
that
his
accomplishments
were
far
superior
to
his
station
in
life
but
then
said
he
the
fellow
has
not
a
shilling
of
his
own
and
would
you
have
me
give
away
my
daughter
to
a
beggar
god
forbid
cried
the
jew
i
always
understood
you
possessed
an
ample
fortune
and
am
sorry
to
find
it
otherwise
cried
the
citizen
with
some
acrimony
take
care
what
you
say
sir
a
credit
is
not
to
be
tampered
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
the
hebrew
i
concluded
that
your
circumstances
were
bad
because
you
objected
to
the
poverty
of
the
young
man
after
you
had
owned
he
was
possessed
of
every
other
qualification
to
make
your
daughter
happy
for
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
you
would
thwart
her
inclinations
or
seek
to
render
an
only
child
miserable
on
account
of
an
obstacle
which
you
yourself
could
easily
remove
let
us
suppose
you
can
afford
to
give
with
your
daughter
ten
thousand
pounds
which
would
enable
this
young
man
to
live
with
credit
and
reputation
and
engage
advantageously
in
trade
for
which
you
say
he
is
well
qualified
the
alternative
then
will
be
whether
you
would
rather
see
her
in
the
arms
of
a
deserving
youth
whom
she
loves
enjoying
all
the
comforts
of
life
with
a
moderate
fortune
which
it
will
always
be
in
your
own
power
to
improve
or
tied
for
life
to
a
monied
man
whom
she
detests
cursing
her
hard
fate
and
despising
that
superfluity
of
wealth
in
spite
of
which
she
finds
herself
so
truly
the
old
gentleman
seemed
to
be
startled
at
this
observation
which
was
reinforced
by
renaldo
saying
that
he
would
moreover
enjoy
the
unutterable
pleasure
of
giving
happiness
to
a
worthy
man
whose
gratitude
would
with
his
love
in
approving
himself
a
dutiful
son
as
well
as
an
affectionate
husband
he
then
represented
the
family
disquiets
and
dismal
tragedies
produced
from
such
mercenary
and
compulsive
matches
and
in
conclusion
related
the
story
of
don
diego
and
his
daughter
which
when
the
merchant
heard
he
started
up
with
marks
of
terror
in
his
countenance
and
throwing
up
the
casement
called
upon
valentine
with
great
vociferation
this
was
the
name
of
his
admirer
who
no
sooner
heard
the
summons
than
he
flew
to
the
spot
from
whence
it
came
and
the
merchant
without
any
further
preamble
seizing
his
hand
joined
it
with
that
of
charlotte
saying
with
great
trepidation
here
take
her
in
the
name
of
god
and
thank
this
honourable
company
for
your
good
the
lovers
were
transported
with
exquisite
joy
at
this
sudden
determination
in
their
favour
valentine
having
kissed
the
hand
of
his
mistress
with
all
the
eagerness
of
rapture
and
acknowledged
the
merchant
generosity
paid
his
respects
to
the
ladies
with
a
very
polite
address
and
with
demonstrations
of
uncommon
gratitude
and
sensibility
thanked
the
gentlemen
and
the
count
in
particular
for
their
good
offices
to
which
he
attributed
the
happiness
he
now
enjoyed
while
serafina
and
madam
clement
caressed
the
amiable
charlotte
the
rest
of
the
company
congratulated
her
admirer
upon
his
choice
and
success
though
the
clergyman
could
not
help
reprehending
him
for
profaning
the
sacerdotal
habit
valentine
heartily
asked
pardon
for
having
given
such
cause
of
offence
and
hoped
he
should
be
forgiven
as
it
was
a
disguise
which
he
thought
absolutely
necessary
for
the
execution
of
a
scheme
upon
which
his
happiness
depended
he
then
at
the
request
of
renaldo
unfolded
the
mystery
of
the
hearse
by
giving
them
to
understand
that
father
having
got
inkling
of
their
mutual
passion
had
dismissed
his
clerk
and
conveyed
his
daughter
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
in
order
to
cut
off
their
correspondence
notwithstanding
these
precautions
they
had
found
means
to
communicate
with
each
other
by
letters
which
were
managed
by
a
third
person
and
his
rival
being
very
importunate
in
his
solicitations
they
had
concerted
the
expedient
of
the
hearse
which
he
provided
and
conducted
through
a
road
contiguous
to
the
end
of
the
merchant
garden
where
charlotte
being
apprised
of
the
design
waited
for
its
approach
and
embarked
in
it
without
hesitation
valentine
thought
himself
sufficiently
screened
from
discovery
by
his
disguise
but
he
was
unfortunately
met
by
a
servant
of
the
family
who
recollected
his
features
and
immediately
gave
the
alarm
upon
which
the
father
and
his
friends
took
horse
and
pursued
them
by
two
different
roads
until
they
were
overtaken
at
this
place
he
had
scarce
finished
this
short
relation
when
his
rival
bluntly
entering
the
apartment
with
an
handkerchief
tied
round
his
eye
committed
valentine
to
the
charge
of
a
constable
who
attended
him
by
a
warrant
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
neighbourhood
and
threatened
to
prosecute
the
merchant
on
an
action
of
damages
for
the
loss
of
an
eye
which
he
said
he
had
sustained
in
his
service
the
company
endeavoured
to
appease
this
citizen
by
representing
that
his
misfortune
was
no
other
than
a
common
inflammation
nor
was
it
owing
to
malice
aforethought
but
entirely
to
the
precipitate
passion
of
an
incensed
young
man
who
by
the
bye
acted
in
his
own
defence
at
the
same
time
the
merchant
promised
to
make
any
reasonable
satisfaction
upon
which
the
other
demanded
an
obligation
importing
that
he
would
in
ten
days
from
the
date
bestow
upon
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
with
a
portion
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
or
in
case
of
failure
pay
him
double
the
sum
the
merchant
exasperated
at
this
extravagant
demand
told
him
flatly
he
had
already
disposed
of
his
daughter
to
valentine
who
he
believed
was
a
much
more
deserving
man
and
that
he
was
ready
to
wait
upon
the
magistrate
who
had
granted
the
warrant
in
order
to
give
bail
for
his
future
this
was
a
mortifying
declaration
to
the
plaintiff
though
he
condoled
himself
with
the
hope
of
being
a
gainer
by
the
loss
of
his
eye
and
now
the
pain
was
over
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
find
his
sight
retrieved
the
old
gentleman
joshua
and
renaldo
accompanied
the
prisoner
to
the
house
of
the
justice
where
he
was
immediately
admitted
to
bail
upon
their
return
valentine
shifted
his
dress
and
they
supped
together
with
great
cordiality
and
mirth
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
discarded
lover
after
supper
don
diego
walked
a
minuet
with
madam
clement
for
whom
by
this
time
he
had
contracted
an
extraordinary
degree
of
affection
valentine
had
the
honour
to
dance
with
the
incomparable
serafina
whose
beauty
and
attractions
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
and
struck
her
bashful
partner
with
awe
and
confusion
and
melvil
presented
his
hand
to
the
agreeable
charlotte
who
performed
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
father
that
he
could
not
help
expressing
his
joy
and
pride
he
praised
god
for
throwing
him
in
the
way
of
our
company
and
engaged
the
clergyman
to
unite
the
young
couple
after
having
appointed
a
day
for
the
ceremony
and
invited
all
present
to
the
wedding
the
evening
having
been
insensibly
consumed
in
these
avocations
and
the
night
pretty
far
advanced
the
ladies
withdrew
without
ceremony
and
the
retreat
of
serafina
filled
renaldo
breast
with
tumult
and
emotion
his
blood
began
to
flow
in
impetuous
tides
his
heart
to
beat
with
redoubled
vigour
and
velocity
while
his
eyes
seemed
to
flash
with
more
than
human
splendour
now
his
imagination
began
to
anticipate
with
the
enthusiastic
rage
of
an
inspired
sibyl
he
was
instantaneously
transported
from
the
conversation
and
every
nerve
was
braced
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
that
human
nature
could
not
long
endure
the
tension
he
therefore
having
withstood
the
impulse
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
length
gave
way
to
his
impetuosity
and
springing
from
his
friends
found
himself
in
a
dark
passage
at
the
farther
end
of
which
he
perceived
madam
clement
coming
out
of
a
chamber
with
a
light
which
at
sight
of
him
she
set
down
and
vanished
in
a
moment
this
was
the
star
that
pointed
to
his
paradise
he
hailed
the
signal
entered
the
apartment
and
like
a
lion
rushing
on
his
prey
approached
the
nuptial
bed
where
serafina
surrounded
by
all
the
graces
of
beauty
softness
sentiment
and
truth
lay
trembling
as
a
victim
at
the
altar
and
strove
to
hide
her
blushes
from
his
view
the
door
was
shut
the
light
extinguished
he
owned
his
lot
was
more
than
mortal
man
could
claim
here
let
me
draw
the
decent
veil
that
ought
to
shade
the
secret
mysteries
of
hymen
away
unhallowed
scoffers
who
profane
with
idle
pleasantry
or
immodest
hint
these
holy
rites
and
leave
those
happy
lovers
to
enjoy
in
one
another
arms
unutterable
bliss
the
palm
of
virtue
and
of
constancy
which
had
undergone
the
most
severe
refinement
a
more
deserving
pair
night
curtain
shrouds
not
in
its
dark
extent
the
thoughts
of
renaldo
felicity
threw
a
damp
on
the
spirits
of
valentine
who
saw
the
term
of
his
probation
protracted
a
few
days
longer
and
could
not
help
wishing
in
his
heart
that
he
had
achieved
the
adventure
which
would
have
abridged
his
expectation
though
at
the
expense
of
the
old
gentleman
displeasure
he
filled
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
throwing
up
his
eyes
with
marks
of
admiration
exclaimed
how
happy
is
the
count
alas
five
days
longer
must
i
rein
my
impatience
it
is
but
reasonable
you
rogue
that
your
betters
should
have
the
start
of
you
said
the
merchant
who
did
him
justice
in
the
glass
and
counselled
him
to
drown
his
impatience
with
good
claret
the
youth
followed
his
advice
and
it
was
late
before
the
company
retired
to
rest
these
citizens
however
resolved
to
seize
an
opportunity
of
rallying
the
couple
according
to
custom
and
with
that
view
arose
early
in
the
morning
on
the
supposition
of
finding
them
still
asleep
but
they
were
not
a
little
surprised
when
they
entered
the
breakfasting
room
to
see
renaldo
and
his
amiable
already
dressed
and
awaiting
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
the
old
gentleman
would
fain
have
cracked
a
joke
upon
their
extraordinary
despatch
but
he
was
so
much
overawed
by
the
dignity
and
tamed
by
the
sweetness
of
serafina
carriage
that
he
durst
not
give
utterance
to
his
conception
and
valentine
stood
silent
and
abashed
as
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
after
breakfast
these
gentlemen
and
charlotte
again
expressed
their
sense
of
the
obligations
they
owed
to
this
happy
family
repeated
their
invitation
and
taking
leave
returned
to
london
in
a
coach
that
was
provided
overnight
our
friends
being
thus
left
to
themselves
don
diego
turned
towards
melvil
now
said
he
that
i
have
yielded
to
the
impatience
of
your
love
as
well
as
to
the
eagerness
of
my
own
desire
to
make
you
happy
i
must
beg
leave
to
interrupt
for
a
little
while
the
stream
of
your
mutual
pleasure
and
propose
a
melancholy
excursion
which
however
will
not
be
wholly
void
of
enjoyment
i
have
too
long
delayed
the
performance
of
my
duty
at
antonia
grave
let
us
spend
the
forenoon
in
that
pious
pilgrimage
i
will
drop
a
few
tears
to
the
memory
of
that
excellent
woman
and
never
afterwards
shall
my
friends
be
troubled
with
my
the
proposal
being
universally
approved
they
set
out
for
the
place
which
had
oft
been
visited
by
the
gentle
serafina
who
conducted
her
father
to
a
black
marble
stone
which
renaldo
had
ordered
to
be
laid
over
the
grave
and
as
he
kneeled
to
kiss
the
monument
he
perceived
this
plain
inscription
in
the
spanish
tongue
antonia
de
zelos
primera
en
todo
lo
que
es
ser
bueno
y
sin
segundo
en
todo
lo
que
fue
ser
desdichado
quedad
con
dios
that
is
antonia
de
zelos
unmatched
in
virtue
and
unequalled
in
misfortune
adieu
o
faithful
record
cried
the
castilian
smiting
his
breast
while
his
tears
distilled
upon
the
marble
thy
goodness
was
the
gift
of
heaven
but
thy
misfortunes
were
derived
from
the
guilt
of
don
diego
yet
his
sorrow
shall
expiate
his
offence
and
his
penitence
find
favour
in
the
sight
of
heaven
rest
rest
virtue
eternal
peace
shall
guard
thy
tomb
and
angels
minister
to
thy
unspotted
shade
nor
shall
thine
ashes
lie
in
dark
obscurity
here
will
i
raise
a
monument
more
suited
to
thy
excellence
and
serafina
melted
with
filial
tenderness
nor
were
the
rest
unmoved
at
this
affecting
scene
which
don
diego
did
not
quit
without
reluctance
chapter
the
longest
and
the
last
the
nature
of
this
visit
had
softened
every
heart
and
saddened
every
countenance
and
they
walked
in
solemn
silence
to
the
other
side
of
the
in
order
to
regain
their
carriages
when
at
the
turning
of
the
stile
they
saw
a
young
woman
in
wretched
attire
running
out
of
a
poor
habitation
wringing
her
hands
in
all
the
agony
of
despair
notwithstanding
the
distraction
in
her
countenance
and
the
meanness
of
her
apparel
she
discovered
a
regularity
of
features
and
a
delicacy
of
air
which
did
not
at
all
correspond
with
the
misery
of
her
equipage
these
exhibitions
of
extreme
distress
soon
attracted
the
notice
and
compassion
of
our
company
and
melvil
beauteous
accosting
this
forlorn
damsel
with
a
aspect
asked
the
cause
of
her
disorder
alas
dear
lady
cried
the
other
with
all
the
emphasis
of
woe
an
unhappy
gentleman
now
breathes
his
last
within
this
inhospitable
hovel
amidst
such
excess
of
misery
as
would
melt
the
most
flinty
bosom
what
then
must
i
feel
who
am
connected
with
him
by
the
strongest
ties
of
love
and
conjugal
affection
who
is
the
unfortunate
object
said
the
physician
he
was
once
well
known
in
the
gay
world
replied
the
young
woman
his
name
is
every
individual
of
the
company
started
at
mention
of
that
detested
name
serafina
began
to
tremble
with
emotion
and
renaldo
after
a
short
pause
declared
he
would
go
in
not
with
a
view
to
exult
over
his
misery
but
in
order
to
contemplate
the
catastrophe
of
such
a
wicked
life
that
the
moral
might
be
the
more
deeply
engraved
on
his
remembrance
the
young
countess
whose
tender
heart
could
not
bear
the
shock
of
such
a
spectacle
retired
to
the
coach
with
madam
clement
and
the
jew
while
renaldo
accompanied
by
the
rest
entered
a
dismal
apartment
altogether
void
of
furniture
and
convenience
where
they
beheld
the
wretched
hero
of
these
memoirs
stretched
almost
naked
upon
straw
insensible
convulsed
and
seemingly
in
the
grasp
of
death
he
was
worn
to
the
bone
either
by
famine
or
distemper
his
face
was
overshadowed
with
hair
and
filth
his
eyes
were
sunk
glazed
and
distorted
his
nostrils
dilated
his
lips
covered
with
a
black
slough
and
his
complexion
faded
into
a
pale
tending
to
a
yellow
hue
in
a
word
the
extremity
of
indigence
squalor
and
distress
could
not
be
more
feelingly
represented
while
melvil
perused
this
melancholy
lesson
and
groaning
cried
behold
the
fate
of
man
he
perceived
a
letter
in
the
right
hand
of
the
unfortunate
fathom
which
lay
fast
clenched
across
his
breast
curious
to
know
the
contents
of
this
paper
which
the
young
woman
said
he
had
kept
in
that
position
for
several
days
he
drew
nearer
the
wretched
couch
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
it
addressed
to
the
right
honourable
renaldo
count
de
melvil
to
the
care
of
joshua
manesseh
merchant
in
london
when
he
attempted
to
disengage
this
billet
from
the
author
hand
the
sorrowing
female
fell
upon
her
knees
entreating
him
to
desist
and
telling
him
she
had
promised
upon
oath
to
communicate
the
contents
to
no
person
upon
earth
but
to
carry
the
letter
upon
her
husband
decease
to
the
gentleman
to
whose
care
it
was
directed
renaldo
assured
her
upon
his
honour
that
he
was
the
very
renaldo
count
de
melvil
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
the
young
creature
was
so
much
confounded
at
this
information
that
before
she
could
recollect
herself
melvil
had
opened
the
billet
and
read
these
words
if
this
paper
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
noble
renaldo
he
will
understand
that
fathom
was
the
most
execrable
traitor
that
ever
imposed
upon
unsuspecting
benevolence
or
attempted
to
betray
a
generous
benefactor
his
whole
life
was
a
series
of
fraud
perfidy
and
the
most
abominable
ingratitude
but
of
all
the
crimes
that
lay
heavy
upon
his
soul
his
being
accessory
to
the
death
of
the
incomparable
serafina
whose
father
he
had
also
robbed
was
that
for
which
he
despaired
of
heaven
forgiveness
notwithstanding
the
dreadful
compunction
and
remorse
which
have
long
preyed
upon
his
heart
together
with
the
incredible
misery
and
deplorable
death
which
by
this
time
he
hath
undergone
though
these
sufferings
and
sorrows
can
not
atone
for
his
enormous
guilt
perhaps
they
will
excite
the
compassion
of
the
humane
count
de
melvil
at
least
this
confession
which
my
conscience
dictates
under
all
the
terrors
of
death
and
futurity
may
be
a
warning
for
him
to
avoid
henceforth
a
smiling
villain
like
the
execrable
fathom
upon
whose
miserable
soul
almighty
god
have
renaldo
was
deeply
affected
with
the
contents
of
this
scroll
which
denoted
such
horror
and
despair
he
saw
there
could
be
no
dissimulation
or
sinister
design
in
this
profession
of
penitence
he
beheld
the
condition
of
the
writer
which
put
all
his
humane
passions
in
commotion
so
that
he
remembered
nothing
of
fathom
but
his
present
distress
he
could
scarce
maintain
those
indications
which
might
have
been
justly
deemed
the
effect
of
weakness
and
infirmity
and
having
desired
the
physician
and
clergyman
to
contribute
their
assistance
for
the
benefit
of
that
wretch
soul
and
body
he
ran
to
the
coach
and
communicated
the
letter
to
the
ladies
at
the
same
time
drawing
a
picture
of
the
object
he
had
seen
which
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
serafina
who
earnestly
entreated
her
lord
to
use
his
endeavours
for
the
relief
and
recovery
of
the
unhappy
man
that
he
might
if
possible
live
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
mature
repentance
and
not
die
in
that
dreadful
despair
which
he
manifested
in
the
letter
renaldo
returning
to
the
house
found
the
pious
clergyman
reading
prayers
with
great
fervency
while
don
diego
stood
with
his
right
hand
upon
his
breast
looking
steadfastly
upon
the
agonising
fathom
and
the
young
woman
kneeled
with
her
streaming
eyes
lifted
up
to
heaven
in
an
ecstasy
of
grief
and
devotion
the
physician
had
run
to
an
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
from
whence
he
soon
returned
with
an
assistant
who
applied
a
large
blister
to
the
back
of
the
miserable
patient
while
the
female
by
the
doctor
direction
moistened
his
mouth
with
a
cordial
which
he
had
prescribed
these
charitable
steps
being
taken
count
de
melvil
entreated
the
apothecary
servant
to
procure
a
for
the
accommodation
of
the
sick
person
with
all
imaginable
despatch
and
in
less
than
an
hour
one
was
actually
pitched
and
fathom
lifted
into
it
after
he
had
been
shifted
and
in
some
measure
purified
from
the
dregs
of
his
indigence
during
this
transaction
the
ladies
were
conducted
to
a
tavern
not
far
off
where
dinner
was
bespoke
that
they
might
be
at
hand
to
see
the
effect
of
their
charity
which
was
not
confined
to
what
we
have
already
described
but
extended
so
far
that
in
a
little
time
the
apartment
was
comfortably
furnished
and
the
young
creature
provided
with
change
of
apparel
and
money
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
subsistence
notwithstanding
all
their
care
the
wretched
fathom
still
remained
insensible
and
the
doctor
pronounced
a
very
unfavourable
prognostic
while
he
ordered
a
pair
of
additional
vesicatories
to
be
laid
upon
his
arms
and
other
proper
medicines
to
be
administered
after
dinner
the
ladies
ventured
to
visit
the
place
and
when
serafina
crossed
the
threshold
the
weeping
female
fell
at
her
feet
and
kissing
her
robe
exclaimed
sure
you
are
an
angel
from
the
alteration
in
her
dress
had
made
a
very
agreeable
change
in
her
appearance
so
that
the
countess
could
now
look
upon
her
without
shuddering
at
her
distress
and
as
fathom
was
not
in
a
condition
to
be
disturbed
she
took
this
opportunity
of
inquiring
by
what
steps
that
unfortunate
wretch
was
conveyed
from
the
prison
in
which
she
knew
he
had
been
confined
to
the
place
where
he
now
lay
in
such
extremity
and
by
what
occurrence
he
had
found
a
wife
in
such
an
abyss
of
misfortune
here
the
other
tears
began
to
flow
afresh
i
am
ashamed
said
she
to
reveal
my
own
folly
yet
i
dare
not
refuse
a
satisfaction
of
this
kind
to
a
person
who
has
laid
me
under
such
signal
she
then
proceeded
to
relate
her
story
by
which
it
appeared
she
was
no
other
than
the
fair
and
unhappy
elenor
whom
the
artful
fathom
had
debauched
upon
his
first
arrival
in
town
in
the
manner
already
described
in
these
memoirs
heaven
continued
she
was
pleased
to
restore
the
use
of
my
reason
which
i
had
lost
when
i
found
myself
abandoned
by
the
count
but
all
my
connexion
with
my
own
family
being
entirely
cut
off
and
every
door
shut
against
a
poor
creature
who
could
procure
no
recommendation
except
the
certificate
signed
by
the
physician
of
bedlam
which
instead
of
introducing
me
to
service
was
an
insurmountable
objection
to
my
character
i
found
myself
destitute
of
all
means
of
subsisting
unless
i
would
condescend
to
live
the
infamous
and
wretched
life
of
a
courtezan
an
expedient
rendered
palatable
by
the
terrors
of
want
cooperating
with
the
reflection
of
the
irretrievable
loss
i
had
already
sustained
i
ask
pardon
for
offending
your
chaste
ears
with
this
impure
confession
of
my
guilt
which
heaven
knows
i
then
did
and
now
do
look
upon
with
abhorrence
and
detestation
i
had
already
forfeited
my
innocence
and
wanted
resolution
to
encounter
misery
and
death
nevertheless
before
i
could
determine
to
embrace
the
condition
of
a
prostitute
i
was
one
day
accosted
in
the
park
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
sat
down
by
me
upon
a
bench
and
taking
notice
of
the
despondence
which
was
evident
in
my
countenance
pressed
me
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
my
misfortune
so
much
sympathy
and
good
sense
appeared
in
his
deportment
and
conversation
that
i
gratified
his
request
and
he
in
return
for
my
confidence
saved
me
from
the
most
horrible
part
of
my
prospect
by
taking
me
into
his
protection
and
reserving
me
for
his
own
appetite
in
this
situation
i
lived
a
whole
year
until
i
was
deprived
of
my
keeper
by
an
apoplectic
fit
and
turned
out
of
doors
by
his
relations
who
did
not
however
strip
me
of
the
clothes
and
moveables
which
i
owed
to
his
bounty
far
from
being
as
yet
reconciled
to
a
vicious
life
i
resolved
to
renounce
the
paths
of
shame
and
converting
my
effects
into
ready
money
hired
a
small
shop
and
furnished
it
with
haberdashery
ware
intending
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
by
the
sale
of
these
commodities
together
with
the
plain
work
in
which
i
hoped
to
be
employed
so
soon
as
my
talents
should
be
known
but
this
scheme
did
not
answer
my
expectation
the
goods
spoiled
upon
my
hands
and
as
i
was
a
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
nobody
would
intrust
me
with
any
other
business
so
that
notwithstanding
the
most
parsimonious
economy
i
ran
in
debt
to
my
landlord
who
seized
my
effects
and
an
hosier
from
whom
i
had
received
some
parcels
upon
credit
took
out
a
writ
against
me
by
virtue
of
which
i
was
arrested
and
imprisoned
in
the
marshalsea
where
i
found
my
first
seducer
good
heaven
what
did
i
feel
at
this
unexpected
meeting
overwhelmed
as
i
was
before
with
my
own
distress
i
with
a
loud
scream
fainted
away
and
when
i
recovered
found
myself
in
the
arms
of
fathom
who
wept
over
me
with
great
affliction
all
his
prospects
of
gaiety
had
now
vanished
and
his
heart
was
softened
by
his
own
misfortunes
to
a
feeling
of
another
woe
as
well
as
to
a
due
sense
of
his
own
guilt
he
expressed
the
deepest
sorrow
for
having
been
the
occasion
of
my
ruin
endeavoured
to
comfort
me
with
a
promise
of
assistance
and
indeed
by
practising
medicine
among
the
prisoners
made
shift
to
keep
us
both
from
starving
but
surely
no
sinner
underwent
such
severe
remorse
as
that
which
he
suffered
during
his
imprisonment
from
the
day
of
our
meeting
i
never
once
saw
him
smile
a
melancholy
cloud
continually
overhung
his
countenance
he
numbered
the
minutes
by
his
groans
he
used
to
start
with
horror
from
his
sleep
and
striking
his
breast
would
exclaim
elenor
i
am
the
worst
of
villains
sometimes
he
seemed
disordered
in
his
brain
and
raved
about
renaldo
and
monimia
in
a
word
his
mind
was
in
a
dreadful
situation
and
all
his
agonies
were
communicated
to
me
whom
by
this
time
he
had
married
in
order
to
make
some
atonement
for
my
wrongs
wretched
as
he
then
was
i
remembered
the
accomplished
youth
who
had
captivated
my
virgin
heart
the
old
impressions
still
remained
i
saw
his
penitence
pitied
his
misfortune
and
his
wife
being
dead
consented
to
join
his
fate
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
by
a
who
was
in
orders
though
his
creditor
had
no
other
chance
of
being
paid
than
that
of
setting
him
at
liberty
he
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
all
our
supplications
and
this
cruelty
conspiring
with
the
anguish
of
my
husband
own
reflection
affected
his
health
and
spirits
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
no
longer
earn
the
miserable
pittance
which
had
hitherto
supported
our
lives
then
our
calamities
began
to
multiply
indigence
and
famine
stared
us
in
the
face
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
we
resisted
their
attacks
by
selling
or
pledging
our
wearing
apparel
until
we
were
left
almost
quite
naked
when
we
found
ourselves
discharged
by
an
act
passed
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtors
this
charitable
law
which
was
intended
for
a
consolation
to
the
wretched
proved
to
us
the
most
severe
disaster
for
we
were
turned
out
into
the
streets
utterly
destitute
of
food
raiment
and
lodging
at
a
time
when
fathom
was
so
weakened
by
his
distemper
that
he
could
not
stand
alone
i
supported
him
from
door
to
door
imploring
the
compassion
of
charitable
christians
and
was
at
length
permitted
to
shelter
him
in
this
miserable
place
where
his
disease
gaining
ground
he
lay
three
days
in
that
deplorable
condition
from
which
he
hath
now
been
rescued
though
i
fear
too
late
by
your
humanity
and
she
shed
a
flood
of
tears
at
the
conclusion
of
this
mournful
tale
which
did
not
fail
to
affect
the
whole
audience
especially
serafina
who
assured
her
that
whatever
should
happen
to
her
husband
she
might
depend
upon
finding
favour
and
protection
provided
her
conduct
should
correspond
with
her
professions
while
this
grateful
creature
kissed
the
hand
of
her
kind
benefactress
fathom
uttered
a
groan
began
to
stir
in
the
bed
and
with
a
languid
voice
called
upon
elenor
who
instantly
withdrawing
the
curtain
presented
the
whole
company
to
his
view
he
had
now
retrieved
the
use
of
his
perception
by
the
operation
of
the
blisters
which
began
to
torture
him
severely
he
looked
around
him
with
amazement
and
affright
and
distinguishing
the
three
persons
against
whom
the
chief
arrows
of
his
fraud
and
treachery
had
been
levelled
he
concluded
that
he
was
now
arrived
at
the
land
of
departed
souls
and
that
the
shades
of
those
whom
he
had
so
grievously
injured
were
come
to
see
him
tormented
according
to
his
demerits
fraught
with
this
notion
which
was
confirmed
by
the
bodily
pain
which
he
felt
and
the
appearance
of
the
clergyman
and
joshua
whom
he
mistook
for
the
ministers
of
vengeance
he
cried
in
a
tone
replete
with
horror
is
there
no
mercy
then
for
penitence
is
there
no
pity
due
to
the
miseries
i
suffered
upon
earth
save
me
o
bountiful
heaven
from
the
terrors
of
everlasting
woe
hide
me
from
these
dreadful
executioners
whose
looks
are
torture
forgive
me
generous
castilian
o
renaldo
thou
hadst
once
a
tender
heart
i
dare
not
lift
my
eyes
to
serafina
that
pattern
of
human
excellence
who
fell
a
victim
to
my
atrocious
guilt
yet
her
aspect
is
all
mildness
and
compassion
hah
are
not
these
the
drops
of
pity
yes
they
are
the
tears
of
mercy
they
fall
like
refreshing
showers
upon
my
drooping
soul
ah
murdered
innocence
wilt
thou
not
intercede
for
thy
betrayer
at
the
throne
of
grace
here
he
was
interrupted
by
melvil
who
with
a
grave
and
solemn
air
pronounced
great
hath
been
thy
guilt
unhappy
ferdinand
and
great
have
been
thy
sufferings
yet
we
come
not
to
insult
but
to
alleviate
thy
distress
providence
hath
kindly
defeated
thy
dire
intentions
which
we
therefore
now
forgive
and
transmit
to
oblivion
whether
it
be
thy
lot
to
yield
up
thy
spirit
immediately
or
to
survive
the
dangerous
malady
with
which
thou
art
at
present
overwhelmed
suffer
not
thyself
to
despair
for
the
mercy
of
heaven
is
infinite
and
submit
to
the
directions
of
this
worthy
gentleman
who
will
employ
his
skill
for
thy
recovery
while
we
shall
take
care
to
furnish
thee
with
necessary
attendance
as
too
much
speaking
may
be
prejudicial
to
thy
health
i
dispense
with
thy
reply
and
exhort
thee
to
compose
thyself
to
so
saying
he
drew
the
curtain
and
the
company
retired
leaving
fathom
entranced
with
wonder
the
next
step
which
renaldo
took
for
the
benefit
of
this
wretched
penitent
was
to
send
for
the
apothecary
with
whom
he
left
a
sum
of
money
to
be
expended
for
the
convenience
of
fathom
and
his
wife
then
he
laid
injunctions
upon
the
physician
to
repeat
his
visits
and
that
gentleman
together
with
the
clergyman
and
joshua
taking
leave
of
the
others
till
next
day
the
count
set
out
with
the
ladies
and
his
to
the
house
where
they
had
lodged
the
preceding
night
the
reader
may
well
imagine
the
conversation
of
the
evening
turned
wholly
upon
the
strange
occurrence
of
the
day
which
seemed
to
have
been
concerted
by
supernatural
prescience
in
order
to
satisfy
the
vengeance
and
afford
matter
of
triumph
to
the
generosity
of
those
who
had
been
so
grievously
injured
by
the
guilty
fathom
though
not
one
of
them
would
say
that
such
a
miscreant
ought
to
live
yet
all
concurred
in
approving
the
offices
of
humanity
which
had
been
performed
and
even
endeavoured
to
find
specious
pretext
for
vindicating
their
compassion
don
diego
said
it
would
ill
become
a
transgressor
like
him
to
withhold
his
forgiveness
from
a
sinner
who
had
wronged
him
madam
clement
appealed
to
the
approbation
of
heaven
which
had
undoubtedly
directed
them
that
way
for
the
purpose
they
had
fulfilled
serafina
observed
that
the
crimes
of
the
delinquent
were
obliterated
by
his
sorrow
misery
and
repentance
renaldo
honestly
owned
that
exclusive
of
other
reasons
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
luxurious
enjoyment
of
communicating
happiness
to
his
in
distress
and
each
fervently
prayed
that
their
charity
might
not
be
disappointed
by
the
death
of
the
object
while
they
amused
themselves
in
these
discussions
fathom
after
having
lain
some
hours
silent
in
consequence
of
renaldo
advice
could
no
longer
suppress
the
astonishment
of
his
mind
but
addressing
himself
to
his
wife
o
elenor
said
he
my
delirium
is
now
past
though
i
still
remember
the
phantasies
of
my
distempered
brain
among
other
reveries
my
imagination
was
regaled
with
a
vision
so
perfect
and
distinct
as
to
emulate
truth
and
reality
methought
count
de
melvil
don
diego
de
zelos
and
the
divine
serafina
the
very
persons
who
are
now
crying
before
the
throne
of
heaven
for
vengeance
against
the
guilty
fathom
stood
by
my
bedside
with
looks
of
pity
and
forgiveness
and
that
renaldo
spoke
peace
to
my
despairing
soul
i
heard
the
words
distinctly
i
retain
them
in
my
memory
i
saw
the
tears
trickle
from
serafina
eyes
i
heard
her
father
utter
a
compassionate
sigh
and
should
actually
believe
that
they
were
personally
present
had
not
i
long
ago
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
funeral
procession
of
that
young
lady
whose
wrongs
god
pardon
and
were
i
not
convinced
that
such
a
meeting
could
not
be
effected
without
the
immediate
and
miraculous
interposition
of
heaven
yet
everything
i
now
see
corresponds
with
the
words
of
renaldo
which
still
sound
in
my
ears
when
my
perception
forsook
me
i
lay
in
the
most
abject
misery
among
straw
and
thou
poor
injured
innocence
wast
naked
and
forlorn
now
i
find
myself
reposed
in
a
warm
easy
comfortable
bed
i
see
around
me
the
marks
of
human
charity
and
care
and
the
favourable
change
in
thy
appearance
glads
my
poor
dejected
heart
say
whence
this
happy
alteration
do
i
really
awake
from
that
dream
of
misery
in
which
we
have
continued
so
long
or
do
i
still
utter
the
extravagant
ravings
of
a
distempered
brain
elenor
was
afraid
of
imparting
at
once
all
the
particulars
of
the
happy
change
he
had
undergone
lest
they
might
leave
a
dangerous
impression
upon
his
fancy
which
was
not
yet
duly
composed
she
contented
herself
therefore
with
telling
him
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
the
humanity
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
who
chanced
to
pass
that
way
by
accident
and
who
understanding
his
deplorable
case
had
furnished
him
with
the
conveniences
which
he
now
enjoyed
she
then
presented
to
him
what
the
doctor
had
directed
her
to
administer
and
admonishing
him
to
commit
his
head
to
the
pillow
he
was
favoured
with
a
breathing
sweat
fell
fast
asleep
and
in
a
few
hours
waked
again
altogether
cool
and
undisturbed
it
was
upon
this
occasion
that
his
wife
explained
the
circumstances
of
that
visit
which
had
redeemed
him
from
extremity
of
wretchedness
and
the
jaws
of
death
upon
which
he
started
up
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
exclaimed
power
this
was
the
work
of
thy
own
bounteous
hand
the
voice
of
my
sorrow
and
repentance
hath
been
heard
thou
hast
inspired
my
benefactors
with
more
than
mortal
goodness
in
my
behalf
how
shall
i
praise
thy
name
how
shall
i
requite
their
generosity
oh
i
am
bankrupt
to
both
yet
let
me
not
perish
until
i
shall
have
convinced
them
of
my
reformation
and
seen
them
enjoying
that
felicity
which
ought
to
be
reserved
for
such
consummate
next
day
in
the
forenoon
he
was
visited
by
the
physician
whom
he
now
recollected
to
have
seen
at
the
house
of
madam
clement
and
after
having
thanked
that
gentleman
for
his
humanity
and
care
he
earnestly
begged
to
know
by
what
means
serafina
had
been
preserved
when
he
was
satisfied
in
this
particular
and
given
to
understand
that
she
was
now
happy
in
the
arms
of
renaldo
blessed
be
god
he
cried
for
having
defeated
the
villany
of
him
who
sought
to
part
such
lovers
dear
sir
will
you
add
one
circumstance
to
your
charity
and
bear
to
that
happy
couple
and
the
noble
don
diego
the
respects
and
the
remorse
of
a
sincere
penitent
whom
their
compassion
hath
raised
to
life
i
have
been
such
a
traitor
to
them
that
my
words
deserve
no
regard
i
will
not
therefore
use
professions
i
dare
not
hope
to
be
admitted
into
their
presence
i
am
indeed
ashamed
to
see
the
light
of
the
sun
how
then
could
i
bear
the
looks
of
that
injured
family
ah
no
let
me
hide
myself
in
some
obscure
retreat
where
i
may
work
out
my
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
and
pray
incessantly
to
heaven
for
their
the
physician
promised
to
represent
his
contrition
to
the
count
and
his
lady
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
their
habitation
where
he
repeated
these
expressions
and
pronounced
his
patient
out
of
danger
so
that
their
thoughts
were
now
employed
in
concerting
a
scheme
for
his
future
subsistence
that
he
might
not
be
exposed
by
indigence
to
a
relapse
in
point
of
morals
renaldo
being
still
averse
to
any
personal
intercourse
with
such
a
wretch
until
he
should
give
some
undoubted
proofs
of
amendment
and
as
yet
afraid
of
intrusting
him
with
any
office
that
required
integrity
resolved
with
the
approbation
of
all
present
to
settle
him
in
a
cheap
county
in
the
north
of
england
where
he
and
his
wife
could
live
comfortably
on
an
annuity
of
sixty
pounds
until
his
behaviour
should
entitle
him
to
a
better
provision
this
resolution
was
just
taken
when
joshua
arrived
with
a
gentleman
whom
he
introduced
to
don
diego
as
the
secretary
of
the
spanish
ambassador
after
the
first
compliments
the
stranger
told
the
castilian
that
he
waited
upon
him
at
the
desire
of
his
excellency
who
would
have
come
in
person
had
he
not
been
confined
by
the
gout
then
he
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
from
the
court
of
madrid
written
by
a
nobleman
of
acquaintance
who
informed
him
that
don
manuel
de
mendoza
having
made
away
with
himself
by
poison
in
order
to
avoid
the
disgrace
of
a
legal
conviction
his
catholic
majesty
was
now
convinced
of
don
innocence
and
granted
him
leave
to
return
and
take
possession
of
his
honours
and
estate
this
information
was
confirmed
by
the
secretary
who
assured
him
that
the
ambassador
had
orders
to
make
him
acquainted
with
this
favourable
decision
of
the
king
the
castilian
having
first
acquitted
himself
in
the
most
polite
terms
to
the
secretary
and
the
jew
who
he
said
had
always
been
a
messenger
of
glad
tidings
communicated
his
happiness
to
the
company
and
this
evening
concluded
the
third
day
of
their
rejoicing
next
morning
don
diego
went
to
visit
the
ambassador
accompanied
by
joshua
and
the
secretary
while
the
physician
repairing
to
the
habitation
of
fathom
signified
by
renaldo
direction
the
resolution
which
had
been
taken
in
his
behalf
and
the
patient
no
sooner
heard
his
doom
than
lifting
up
his
hands
he
cried
i
am
unworthy
of
such
tenderness
and
while
elenor
shed
a
flood
of
tears
in
silence
unable
to
give
utterance
to
her
grateful
thought
bounty
having
so
far
transcended
her
most
sanguine
hope
the
spaniard
having
paid
his
devoirs
to
his
excellency
returned
before
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
desiring
a
private
conference
with
serafina
they
retired
into
another
apartment
and
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
you
have
contracted
my
dear
child
an
habit
of
calling
madam
clement
your
mother
and
doubtless
by
her
maternal
tenderness
and
regard
she
hath
acquired
a
just
title
to
the
appellation
yet
i
own
i
would
fain
strengthen
it
by
a
legal
claim
i
no
sooner
retrieved
my
daughter
than
i
gave
her
away
to
the
most
deserving
youth
that
ever
sighed
with
i
rejoice
in
the
gift
which
secured
your
happiness
but
i
left
myself
in
a
solitary
situation
which
even
the
return
of
my
good
fortune
can
not
render
easy
and
supportable
when
i
revisit
the
castle
of
zelos
every
object
will
recall
the
memory
of
my
antonia
and
i
shall
want
a
companion
to
fill
her
place
and
to
sympathise
with
me
in
that
sorrow
which
will
be
derived
from
my
remembrance
who
is
there
so
worthy
to
succeed
your
mother
in
the
affection
of
don
diego
as
she
who
interests
her
love
for
serafina
and
resembles
her
so
strongly
in
every
virtue
of
the
sex
similar
attractions
will
produce
similar
effects
my
heart
is
already
attached
to
that
good
lady
and
provided
serafina
shall
approve
of
my
choice
i
will
lay
myself
and
fortune
at
her
the
fair
countess
replied
with
an
enchanting
smile
that
before
this
declaration
she
had
with
pleasure
perceived
the
progress
which
madam
clement
had
made
in
his
heart
and
that
she
did
not
believe
there
was
a
person
upon
earth
better
qualified
to
repair
the
loss
he
had
sustained
though
she
foresaw
one
obstacle
to
his
happiness
which
she
was
afraid
would
not
be
easily
surmounted
you
mean
answered
the
castilian
the
difference
of
religion
which
i
am
resolved
to
remove
by
adopting
the
protestant
faith
though
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
real
goodness
is
of
no
particular
persuasion
and
that
salvation
can
not
depend
upon
belief
over
which
the
will
has
no
influence
i
invest
you
therefore
with
the
charge
of
declaring
my
passion
and
proposal
and
empower
you
to
satisfy
her
scruples
with
regard
to
the
religion
which
i
now
profess
and
which
i
shall
not
openly
relinquish
until
i
shall
have
secured
in
this
country
effects
sufficient
to
screen
me
from
the
ill
consequences
of
my
serafina
undertook
this
office
with
pleasure
because
she
had
reason
to
think
his
addresses
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
madam
clement
and
that
same
night
made
the
count
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
her
commission
nor
was
her
expectation
disappointed
the
french
lady
with
that
frankness
which
is
peculiar
to
virtue
and
good
breeding
confessed
that
don
diego
was
not
indifferent
to
her
choice
and
did
not
hesitate
in
receiving
him
upon
the
footing
of
a
as
we
have
already
dwelt
circumstantially
on
the
passion
of
love
so
as
perhaps
even
to
have
tired
our
readers
we
shall
not
repeat
the
dialogue
that
passed
when
the
spaniard
was
indulged
with
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
sentiments
suffice
it
to
observe
that
the
lady
days
of
coquetry
were
now
over
and
that
she
was
too
wise
to
trifle
with
the
time
which
every
moment
became
more
and
more
precious
it
was
agreed
then
that
don
diego
should
settle
his
affairs
in
spain
and
return
to
england
in
order
to
espouse
madam
clement
with
a
view
to
fix
his
residence
in
this
island
where
renaldo
likewise
proposed
to
enjoy
the
sweets
of
his
fortune
provided
he
could
draw
hither
his
interests
and
connexions
meanwhile
having
for
some
days
enjoyed
his
bliss
with
all
the
fulness
of
rapture
amidst
this
small
but
agreeable
society
he
shifted
the
scene
and
conducted
his
dear
partner
to
a
house
in
town
which
together
with
an
occasional
equipage
his
friend
joshua
had
hired
for
the
accommodation
of
him
and
his
who
during
his
stay
in
england
failed
not
to
cultivate
the
mistress
of
his
heart
with
the
most
punctual
assiduity
hitherto
serafina
had
been
as
a
precious
jewel
locked
up
in
a
casket
which
the
owner
alone
had
an
opportunity
to
contemplate
but
now
the
count
who
was
proud
of
such
a
prize
resolved
to
let
her
shine
forth
to
the
admiration
of
the
whole
world
with
this
view
he
bespoke
such
ornaments
as
befitted
her
quality
and
while
the
were
employed
in
her
service
made
a
tour
among
his
former
acquaintance
and
discharged
the
obligations
under
which
he
lay
to
some
who
had
assisted
him
in
his
distress
he
did
not
however
introduce
them
to
his
charming
serafina
because
not
one
of
them
had
formerly
treated
her
with
that
delicacy
of
regard
which
he
thought
her
due
and
some
of
them
were
much
mortified
at
their
neglect
when
they
saw
what
a
dazzling
figure
she
made
in
the
beau
monde
she
was
visited
by
the
spanish
and
imperial
ambassadors
and
divers
other
foreigners
of
distinction
to
whom
melvil
had
letters
of
recommendation
but
her
first
public
appearance
was
in
a
box
at
the
opera
accompanied
by
madam
clement
the
count
and
don
diego
the
entertainment
was
already
begun
so
that
her
entrance
had
the
greater
effect
upon
the
audience
whose
attention
was
soon
detached
from
the
performance
and
riveted
upon
this
amiable
apparition
which
seemed
to
be
some
bright
being
of
another
world
dropped
from
the
clouds
among
them
then
did
the
spirit
of
curiosity
play
its
part
a
thousand
whispers
circulated
as
many
glasses
were
exalted
to
reconnoitre
this
box
of
foreigners
for
such
they
concluded
them
to
be
from
their
appearance
every
male
spectator
acknowledged
serafina
to
be
the
paragon
of
beauty
and
every
female
confessed
that
melvil
was
the
model
of
a
fine
gentleman
the
charms
of
the
young
countess
did
not
escape
the
eye
and
approbation
of
royalty
itself
and
when
her
rank
was
known
from
the
information
of
the
ambassadors
and
other
people
of
condition
who
were
seen
saluting
her
at
a
distance
that
same
evening
a
thousand
bumpers
were
swallowed
in
honour
of
the
countess
de
melvil
the
fame
of
her
beauty
was
immediately
extended
over
this
immense
metropolis
and
different
schemes
were
concerted
for
bringing
her
into
life
these
however
she
resisted
with
unwearied
obstinacy
her
happiness
centred
in
renaldo
and
the
cultivation
of
a
few
friends
within
the
shade
of
domestic
quiet
she
did
not
even
forget
the
concerns
of
the
wretched
fathom
and
his
faithful
elenor
who
daily
enjoyed
fresh
instances
of
her
humanity
and
care
when
his
fever
forsook
him
he
was
supplied
with
nourishing
food
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
and
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
travel
he
gave
notice
to
his
benefactor
who
desired
joshua
to
settle
with
him
the
manner
in
which
he
was
to
receive
his
allowance
and
to
pay
the
first
salary
per
advance
this
affair
being
adjusted
and
the
place
of
his
retreat
signified
the
jew
told
elenor
that
she
might
wait
upon
the
countess
before
their
departure
and
she
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
after
they
had
made
the
necessary
preparations
for
their
journey
and
taken
places
in
the
york
fathom
clothing
herself
in
decent
apparel
went
to
the
house
of
count
melvil
and
was
immediately
admitted
to
the
presence
of
serafina
who
received
her
with
her
usual
complacency
enriched
her
with
salutary
advice
comforted
her
with
the
hope
of
better
things
provided
her
conduct
and
that
of
her
husband
should
henceforth
be
found
irreproachable
and
wishing
her
peace
and
happiness
presented
her
with
a
box
of
linen
and
twenty
guineas
in
a
purse
such
excessive
goodness
overpowered
this
sensible
young
woman
to
such
a
degree
that
she
stood
before
her
in
speechless
awe
and
veneration
and
the
countess
in
order
to
relieve
her
from
the
confusion
under
which
she
suffered
quitted
the
room
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
her
woman
it
was
not
long
however
before
her
gratitude
broke
out
in
loud
exclamations
and
a
violent
passion
of
tears
which
all
her
efforts
could
not
for
a
while
overcome
by
this
time
the
coach
was
brought
up
to
the
gate
for
the
reception
of
serafina
who
took
an
airing
every
day
at
the
same
hour
when
renaldo
leading
her
to
the
vehicle
beheld
a
man
plainly
dressed
standing
within
the
court
with
his
head
and
body
bent
towards
the
earth
so
that
his
countenance
could
not
be
perceived
melvil
who
supposed
him
to
be
some
unfortunate
man
come
to
implore
his
charity
turned
towards
him
and
asked
with
a
humane
accent
if
he
wanted
to
speak
with
any
person
in
the
house
to
this
interrogation
the
stranger
replied
without
lifting
up
his
head
overwhelmed
as
i
am
with
count
melvil
generosity
together
with
a
consciousness
of
my
own
unworthiness
it
ill
becomes
a
wretch
like
me
to
importune
him
for
further
favour
yet
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
withdrawing
perhaps
for
ever
from
the
presence
of
my
benefactor
without
soliciting
his
permission
to
see
his
face
in
mercy
to
acknowledge
my
atrocious
crimes
to
hear
my
pardon
confirmed
by
his
voice
and
that
of
his
accomplished
countess
whom
i
dare
not
even
at
a
distance
behold
and
to
express
my
fervent
wish
for
their
melvil
whose
heart
was
but
too
tender
could
not
hear
this
address
without
emotion
he
recognised
the
companion
of
his
infancy
and
youth
he
remembered
the
happy
scenes
he
had
enjoyed
with
fathom
whose
voice
had
always
such
an
effect
upon
his
ear
as
to
excite
the
ideas
of
friendship
and
esteem
and
he
was
disturbed
by
this
unexpected
meeting
which
also
discomposed
the
beauteous
serafina
renaldo
having
paused
a
little
it
is
with
pain
said
he
i
recollect
anything
to
the
prejudice
of
fathom
whose
future
behaviour
will
i
hope
erase
the
memory
of
his
offences
and
justify
what
other
steps
i
may
take
in
his
favour
meanwhile
i
heartily
forgive
what
is
past
and
in
token
of
my
sincerity
present
my
hand
which
our
adventurer
bathed
with
his
tears
the
countess
whose
mind
was
in
unison
with
her
husband
repeated
her
assurances
of
pardon
and
protection
at
which
the
penitent
rejoiced
in
silence
while
he
raised
his
head
and
took
a
parting
view
of
those
charms
which
had
formerly
enslaved
his
heart
having
thus
obeyed
the
dictates
of
his
duty
and
inclination
he
next
morning
embarked
in
the
with
his
faithful
elenor
and
in
six
days
arrived
at
the
place
of
his
retreat
which
he
found
extremely
well
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
his
mind
and
fortune
for
all
his
vice
and
ambition
was
now
quite
mortified
within
him
and
his
whole
attention
engrossed
in
atoning
for
his
former
crimes
by
a
sober
and
penitent
life
by
which
alone
he
could
deserve
the
uncommon
generosity
of
his
patrons
while
he
thus
accommodated
himself
to
his
new
system
renaldo
received
letters
of
congratulation
from
his
sister
who
with
the
major
had
come
to
brussels
in
order
to
meet
her
brother
and
serafina
according
to
his
proposal
this
intimation
being
communicated
to
don
diego
he
resolved
to
accompany
them
to
flanders
on
his
way
to
spain
preparations
were
made
for
their
departure
the
clergyman
and
physician
were
honoured
with
valuable
marks
of
friendship
and
esteem
from
the
countess
renaldo
and
the
castilian
who
were
convoyed
to
deal
by
madam
clement
to
whom
at
parting
don
diego
presented
a
diamond
ring
as
a
pledge
of
his
inviolable
love
here
the
travellers
hired
a
vessel
for
ostend
which
they
reached
in
a
few
hours
in
two
days
more
they
arrived
at
brussels
where
farrel
and
her
husband
were
struck
with
admiration
at
the
surprising
beauty
and
accomplishment
of
their
whom
they
caressed
with
equal
tenderness
and
in
a
word
all
parties
were
as
happy
as
good
fortune
could
make
them
and
don
diego
set
out
for
spain
after
they
had
agreed
to
reside
