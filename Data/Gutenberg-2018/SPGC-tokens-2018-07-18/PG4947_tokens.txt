to
frances
rose
benet
dear
mother
of
my
mother
child
to
you
the
tribute
brings
not
praise
from
me
alone
still
clings
some
grace
of
hers
to
what
i
do
and
the
gift
comes
in
her
name
as
my
own
chapter
i
cherry
strickland
came
in
the
door
of
the
strickland
house
and
shut
it
behind
her
and
stood
so
with
her
hands
behind
her
on
the
knob
and
her
slender
body
leaning
forward
and
her
breath
rising
and
falling
on
deep
ecstatic
breaths
it
was
may
in
california
she
was
just
eighteen
and
for
minutes
she
had
been
engaged
to
be
married
she
hardly
knew
why
after
that
last
farewell
to
martin
she
had
run
so
swiftly
up
the
path
and
why
she
had
flashed
into
the
house
and
closed
the
door
with
such
noiseless
haste
there
was
nothing
to
run
for
but
it
was
as
if
she
feared
that
the
joy
within
her
might
escape
into
the
moonlight
night
that
was
so
perfumed
with
lilacs
and
the
scent
of
wet
woods
in
this
new
happiness
of
hers
a
fear
was
already
mingled
a
sweet
fear
truly
and
a
delicious
fear
but
she
had
never
feared
anything
before
in
her
life
she
was
afraid
now
that
it
was
all
too
wonderful
to
be
true
that
she
would
awaken
in
the
morning
to
find
it
only
a
dream
that
she
would
somehow
fall
short
of
ideal
somehow
fail
him
somehow
turn
all
this
magic
of
moonshine
and
kisses
into
ashes
and
heartbreak
she
was
a
miser
with
her
treasure
already
she
wanted
to
fly
with
it
and
to
hide
it
away
and
to
test
its
reality
in
secret
alone
she
had
come
running
in
from
the
wonderland
down
by
the
gate
just
for
this
just
to
prove
to
herself
that
it
would
not
vanish
in
the
commonplaceness
of
the
shabby
hall
would
not
disappear
before
the
everyday
contact
of
everyday
things
there
was
moonlight
here
too
falling
in
clear
squares
on
the
stairway
landing
white
and
mysterious
and
bewitching
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
was
wholesome
cheerful
lamplight
creeping
in
a
warm
streak
under
the
door
dad
was
in
the
sitting
room
with
the
girls
the
doctor
house
was
full
of
girls
anne
his
niece
was
alix
cherry
sister
three
years
younger
how
staid
and
unmarried
and
undesired
they
seemed
to
panting
and
glowing
and
glorified
eighteen
anne
with
alix
erratic
help
kept
house
for
her
uncle
and
was
supposed
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
cherry
too
but
she
had
been
sharp
enough
to
keep
martin
lloyd
from
asking
her
to
marry
him
exulted
cherry
as
she
stood
breathless
and
laughing
in
the
dark
hallway
cherry
had
never
had
any
other
home
than
this
shabby
brown
bungalow
and
she
knew
every
inch
of
the
hall
even
without
light
to
see
it
she
knew
the
faded
rugs
and
the
study
door
that
swallowed
up
her
father
every
day
and
the
table
where
alix
had
put
a
great
bowl
of
buttercups
and
the
door
at
the
back
through
which
the
doctor
girls
had
looked
out
at
many
a
frosty
morning
and
red
sunset
and
summer
afternoon
but
even
the
old
hall
had
seemed
transformed
lighted
with
a
beauty
quite
new
scented
with
an
immortal
sweetness
hong
came
out
of
the
dining
room
the
varnished
buttercups
twinkled
in
a
sudden
flood
of
light
he
had
come
to
put
a
folded
tablecloth
into
the
old
wardrobe
that
did
for
a
sideboard
under
the
stairs
cherry
descending
to
earth
smiled
at
him
and
crossed
the
hall
to
the
door
an
older
woman
might
have
gone
upstairs
to
dream
alone
of
her
new
joy
but
cherry
thought
that
it
would
be
fun
to
join
the
family
and
act
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
was
only
a
child
after
all
consciously
or
unconsciously
they
had
all
tried
to
keep
her
a
child
these
three
who
looked
up
to
smile
at
her
as
she
came
in
one
of
them
rosy
magnificent
at
sixty
was
her
father
whose
favourite
she
knew
she
was
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
without
closing
the
book
that
was
in
the
other
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
wide
arm
of
his
chair
where
she
settled
herself
with
her
soft
young
body
resting
against
him
her
slim
ankles
crossed
and
her
cheek
dropped
against
his
thick
silver
hair
alix
was
reading
and
dreamily
scratching
her
ankle
as
she
read
she
was
a
tall
awkward
girl
younger
far
at
than
cherry
was
at
eighteen
pretty
in
a
gipsyish
way
untidy
as
to
hair
with
round
black
eyes
high
thin
marked
with
scarlet
and
a
wide
humorous
mouth
that
was
somehow
droll
in
its
expression
even
when
she
was
angry
or
serious
she
was
rarely
angry
she
was
unexacting
preferring
animals
to
people
and
unconventional
in
speech
and
manner
her
father
and
anne
sometimes
discussed
her
anxiously
they
confessed
that
they
were
rather
fearful
for
alix
for
cherry
neither
one
had
ever
had
a
disquieting
thought
anne
smiling
demurely
over
her
white
sewing
was
a
small
little
woman
with
silky
hair
trimly
braided
and
a
rather
pale
small
face
with
charming
and
regular
features
she
was
not
considered
exactly
pretty
perhaps
the
contrast
with
cherry
unusual
beauty
was
rather
hard
on
both
the
older
girls
but
she
was
so
perfectly
capable
in
her
little
groove
so
busy
contented
and
necessary
in
the
doctor
household
that
it
was
rather
a
habit
with
all
their
friends
to
praise
anne
anne
had
admirers
too
cherry
reflected
looking
at
her
but
neither
she
nor
alix
had
ever
been
engaged
engaged
engaged
are
you
home
early
said
doctor
strickland
rubbing
his
cheek
against
his
youngest
daughter
cheek
in
sleepy
content
he
was
never
quite
happy
unless
all
three
girls
were
in
his
sight
but
for
this
girl
he
had
always
felt
an
especial
protecting
fondness
it
seemed
only
yesterday
that
cherry
a
sturdy
little
girl
in
a
checked
gingham
apron
had
been
trotting
off
to
school
to
him
it
was
yesterday
that
she
had
been
a
baby
digging
in
the
garden
paths
and
sniffing
at
the
border
pinks
he
had
followed
her
exquisite
childhood
with
more
than
a
father
usual
devotion
perhaps
because
she
really
had
been
an
exceptionally
endearing
child
perhaps
because
she
had
been
given
him
a
tiny
crying
thing
in
a
blanket
to
fill
the
great
gap
her
mother
going
had
left
in
his
heart
he
had
sympathized
with
her
microscopic
cut
fingers
he
had
smiled
into
her
glowing
damp
little
face
when
she
stuttered
to
him
long
tales
of
bad
doggies
and
big
he
had
brought
her
jacks
and
and
hair
ribbons
he
loved
the
diminutive
femininity
of
the
creature
she
was
all
a
woman
even
at
three
alix
he
proudly
called
his
boy
alix
used
hair
ribbons
to
tie
up
her
dogs
and
demanded
hip
boots
and
an
air
rifle
and
got
them
too
and
used
them
but
when
he
took
alix
in
his
arms
she
was
apt
to
bump
his
nose
violently
with
her
hard
young
head
to
break
his
glasses
or
at
best
to
wriggle
herself
free
little
cherry
however
was
of
dogs
she
told
her
father
and
of
guns
and
she
would
curl
up
in
his
arms
for
happy
with
her
gold
curls
sprayed
against
his
shoulder
and
her
soft
little
hand
tucked
into
his
own
lloyd
had
to
take
the
nine
train
cherry
answered
her
father
dreamily
and
he
and
peter
walked
home
with
me
she
did
not
add
that
peter
had
left
them
at
his
own
turning
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
at
north
for
dinner
anne
observed
quietly
in
the
silence
she
had
been
informally
asked
to
the
norths
for
dinner
that
evening
herself
and
had
declined
for
no
other
reason
than
that
attractive
martin
lloyd
was
presumably
not
to
be
there
he
was
cherry
said
he
thought
he
had
to
go
to
town
at
six
i
just
stopped
in
to
give
them
dad
message
and
they
teased
me
to
stay
you
knew
where
i
was
did
you
dad
she
murmured
north
telephoned
about
six
and
said
you
were
there
but
she
did
say
that
lloyd
was
anne
said
with
a
faint
hint
of
discontent
in
her
tone
alix
fixed
her
bright
mischievous
eyes
upon
the
two
and
suspended
her
reading
for
a
moment
alix
attitude
toward
the
opposite
sex
was
one
of
calm
contempt
outwardly
but
she
had
made
rather
an
exception
of
martin
lloyd
and
had
recently
had
a
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
sensible
platonic
friendships
between
men
and
women
at
the
mention
of
his
name
she
looked
up
remembering
this
talk
with
a
little
thrill
his
name
had
thrilled
anne
too
although
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
it
as
she
sat
quietly
matching
silks
in
fact
all
three
of
the
girls
were
quite
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
young
lloyd
if
two
of
them
had
not
actually
done
so
he
was
a
newcomer
in
the
little
town
a
tall
presentable
fellow
ready
with
laughter
ready
with
words
and
always
more
than
ready
for
flirtation
he
admitted
that
he
liked
to
flirt
his
gay
daring
had
quite
carried
anne
citadel
and
had
even
gained
alix
grudging
response
cherry
had
not
been
at
home
when
martin
first
appeared
in
mill
valley
and
the
older
girls
had
written
her
visiting
friends
in
napa
that
she
must
come
and
meet
the
new
man
martin
was
a
mining
engineer
he
had
been
employed
in
a
nevada
mine
but
was
visiting
his
cousin
in
the
valley
now
before
going
to
a
new
position
in
june
in
its
informal
fashion
mill
valley
had
entertained
him
he
had
tramped
to
the
big
forest
five
miles
away
with
the
stricklands
and
there
had
been
a
picnic
to
the
everybody
making
the
hard
climb
except
peter
joyce
who
was
a
trifle
lame
and
perhaps
a
little
lazy
as
well
and
who
usually
rode
an
old
horse
with
the
lunch
in
at
each
side
alix
formulated
her
theories
of
platonic
friendships
on
these
walks
anne
dreamed
a
foolish
happy
dream
girls
did
marry
men
did
take
wives
to
themselves
dreamed
anne
it
would
be
unspeakably
sweet
but
it
would
be
no
miracle
and
anne
always
busy
and
happy
and
helpful
was
more
so
than
ever
unpacking
the
delicious
lunch
capably
arranging
for
comfort
and
pleasure
looking
up
with
innocent
surprise
when
martin
bent
over
her
as
she
fussed
and
rearranged
baskets
i
thought
you
were
gathering
wood
did
you
indeed
let
the
other
fellows
do
that
i
sha
be
here
forever
and
i
privileged
would
you
like
me
to
give
you
something
else
to
do
no
i
quite
happy
thank
you
not
much
in
the
words
to
remember
truly
but
the
tone
and
the
look
went
straight
to
anne
heart
every
time
she
looked
up
at
the
mountain
rearing
its
dark
crest
above
the
little
valley
they
had
come
back
to
her
that
was
all
several
weeks
ago
now
it
was
just
after
that
mountain
picnic
that
cherry
had
come
home
on
a
sunday
as
it
chanced
that
was
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
on
which
martin
and
his
aunt
were
coming
to
dinner
alix
had
marked
the
occasion
by
wearing
a
loose
velvet
gown
in
which
she
fancied
herself
anne
had
conscientiously
decorated
the
table
had
seen
to
it
that
there
was
and
chicken
and
all
the
accessories
that
make
a
sunday
dinner
in
the
country
a
national
institution
cherry
had
done
nothing
helpful
on
the
contrary
she
had
disgraced
herself
and
infuriated
hong
by
deciding
to
make
fudge
the
last
minute
hong
had
finally
relegated
her
to
the
laundry
and
it
was
from
this
limbo
that
martin
laughing
joyously
extricated
her
when
sticky
and
repentant
she
had
called
for
help
it
was
martin
who
untied
the
checked
brown
apron
disentangling
from
the
strings
the
silky
gold
tendrils
that
were
blowing
over
cherry
white
neck
and
martin
who
opened
the
door
for
her
sugary
fingers
and
martin
who
watched
the
flying
little
figure
out
of
sight
with
a
prolonged
of
utter
astonishment
the
child
was
a
beauty
but
if
she
was
beautiful
when
flushed
and
cross
and
sticky
there
was
no
word
for
her
when
she
presently
came
demurely
downstairs
her
exquisite
little
red
mouth
still
pouting
her
bright
head
still
drooping
sulkily
but
her
wonderful
eyes
glinting
mischief
and
the
dark
tumbled
apron
replaced
by
thin
white
ruffles
that
began
at
cherry
shoulders
and
ended
above
her
ankles
soft
firm
round
chin
straight
little
nose
blue
eyes
ringed
with
babyish
shadows
martin
found
them
all
adorable
as
was
every
inch
of
the
slender
beautifully
made
little
body
the
brown
warm
hand
the
clear
childish
forehead
the
square
little
foot
in
a
shining
slipper
her
eighteenth
birthday
he
learned
that
she
had
just
put
up
her
hair
indeed
after
dinner
her
father
made
her
tumble
it
down
in
a
golden
mop
again
ca
lose
my
last
girl
you
know
he
said
to
north
martin
aunt
seriously
martin
had
been
shown
her
birthday
gifts
books
and
a
silver
belt
buckle
and
a
gold
pen
and
stationery
and
handkerchiefs
a
day
or
two
later
she
had
had
another
gift
had
opened
the
tiny
shreve
box
with
a
sudden
hammering
at
her
heart
with
a
presage
of
delight
she
had
found
a
candy
jar
and
the
card
of
john
martin
lloyd
and
under
the
name
in
tiny
letters
the
words
o
fudge
the
girls
laughed
over
this
nonsense
appreciatively
but
there
was
more
than
laughter
in
cherry
heart
from
that
moment
the
world
was
changed
her
father
her
sister
her
cousin
had
second
place
now
cherry
had
put
out
her
innocent
little
hand
and
had
opened
the
gate
and
had
passed
through
it
into
the
world
that
hour
was
the
beginning
and
it
had
led
her
surely
steadily
to
the
other
hour
when
she
had
been
kissed
and
had
kissed
in
return
nobody
dreamed
it
she
told
herself
with
innocent
exultation
looking
at
alix
sunk
into
her
chair
ungracefully
and
at
anne
peacefully
sewing
they
thought
of
her
as
a
child
she
who
was
engaged
to
be
married
so
we
walk
home
with
young
men
mused
the
doctor
smiling
look
here
girls
this
little
miss
muffet
will
be
cutting
you
both
out
with
that
young
man
if
you
not
careful
alix
deep
in
her
story
did
not
hear
him
but
anne
smiled
faintly
and
faintly
frowned
as
she
shook
her
head
she
considered
cherry
sufficiently
precocious
without
uncle
lee
tolerance
anne
had
often
told
him
that
cherry
was
the
type
that
would
attract
boys
soon
enough
without
any
encouragement
from
him
but
he
persisted
in
regarding
her
as
nothing
more
than
a
captivating
baby
he
would
have
had
them
always
children
this
tender
simple
innocent
doctor
strickland
he
was
in
many
ways
a
child
himself
he
had
never
made
money
in
his
profession
he
and
his
wife
and
the
two
tiny
girls
had
had
a
hard
enough
struggle
sometimes
anne
and
her
own
father
had
joined
the
family
eight
years
ago
in
the
same
year
that
the
strickland
patent
fire
extinguisher
over
which
the
doctor
had
been
puttering
for
years
had
been
sold
it
did
not
sell
as
his
neighbours
believed
for
a
million
dollars
but
for
perhaps
one
tenth
of
that
sum
it
was
enough
and
more
than
enough
whatever
it
was
after
anne
father
died
it
meant
that
the
doctor
could
live
on
in
the
brown
house
under
the
redwoods
with
his
girls
reading
fussing
with
a
new
invention
walking
consulting
with
anne
laughing
at
alix
and
spoiling
his
the
house
was
shingled
low
framed
in
wide
porches
smelling
within
and
without
of
the
sweet
woods
about
it
here
the
stricklands
weathered
the
cold
damp
winters
when
the
trees
dripped
and
the
creeks
swelled
and
here
they
watched
the
first
emerald
of
spring
breaking
through
the
loam
of
a
thousand
autumns
here
they
hunted
for
iris
and
wild
lilac
in
april
and
hung
japanese
lanterns
through
the
long
warm
summers
it
was
a
perfect
life
for
the
old
man
it
was
only
lately
that
he
begun
uneasily
to
suspect
that
they
would
some
day
want
something
more
that
they
would
some
day
tire
of
empty
forest
and
blowing
mountain
ridge
and
go
away
from
the
shadow
of
mt
tamalpais
and
into
the
world
anne
now
was
she
beginning
to
fancy
this
young
lloyd
doctor
strickland
was
surprised
with
the
fervour
with
which
he
repudiated
the
thought
anne
had
been
admired
she
must
go
to
her
own
home
some
day
but
her
uncle
hoped
that
it
would
be
a
neighbouring
home
this
young
engineer
who
had
drifted
already
into
a
dozen
different
and
distant
places
was
not
the
man
for
staid
little
anne
he
was
years
old
but
it
was
not
the
discrepancy
in
years
that
mattered
the
doctor
had
himself
been
twelve
years
older
than
his
wife
no
it
was
something
less
tangible
what
did
you
want
to
see
lloyd
about
dad
cherry
interrupted
his
thoughts
to
ask
the
rose
vine
her
father
reminded
her
you
never
get
that
back
on
the
roof
alix
looked
up
to
assure
him
discouragingly
i
told
you
when
you
were
pruning
it
she
added
vivaciously
that
you
were
cutting
too
deep
no
you
knew
it
all
now
the
first
wind
brings
it
down
all
over
the
place
and
you
get
exactly
what
you
deserve
her
tone
was
less
harsh
than
her
words
indeed
it
was
the
tone
he
loved
from
her
that
of
a
devoted
but
mother
she
came
to
cherry
hassock
and
dropped
on
it
and
rested
her
untidy
head
against
his
knee
anne
aided
and
abetted
me
said
the
doctor
meekly
to
the
extent
of
handing
you
your
shears
anne
said
promptly
no
but
really
you
know
dad
you
were
a
little
creature
to
do
that
alix
said
musically
you
might
just
as
well
cut
it
down
at
the
roots
and
plant
another
double
banksia
i
rather
thought
that
lloyd
might
have
some
idea
of
a
tackle
or
a
derrick
or
something
submitted
her
father
vaguely
well
if
anybody
can
anne
conceded
laughing
what
did
he
say
about
coming
over
cherry
but
cherry
had
not
been
listening
and
the
conversation
was
reviewed
for
her
benefit
she
remarked
between
two
rending
yawns
that
lloyd
was
coming
over
at
ten
and
peter
too
peter
wo
be
much
good
alix
commented
cherry
looked
at
her
reproachfully
you
awfully
mean
to
peter
lately
she
protested
her
father
gave
her
a
shrewd
look
with
his
kiss
and
immediately
afterward
both
the
younger
girls
dragged
their
way
up
to
bed
alix
and
cherry
shared
a
bare
room
tucked
away
under
brown
eaves
the
walls
were
of
raw
pine
the
latticed
windows
in
bungalow
fashion
opened
into
the
fragrant
darkness
of
the
night
the
beds
were
really
bunks
and
above
her
bunk
each
girl
had
an
extra
berth
for
occasional
guests
there
was
scant
prettiness
in
the
room
and
yet
it
was
full
of
purity
and
charm
the
girls
sat
upon
their
beds
while
they
were
undressing
and
plunged
upon
their
knees
on
the
bare
pine
floor
and
rested
their
elbows
upon
the
faded
patchwork
quilts
while
they
said
their
prayers
mill
valley
was
so
healthful
a
little
mountain
village
that
among
her
two
thousand
residents
there
was
only
one
doctor
the
old
man
who
sat
by
the
fire
downstairs
and
he
had
formally
retired
from
general
practice
the
girls
like
all
their
neighbours
were
hardy
bred
to
cold
baths
long
walks
simple
hours
and
simple
food
in
the
soft
western
climate
they
left
their
bedroom
windows
open
the
year
round
they
liked
to
wake
to
winter
damp
and
fog
and
go
downstairs
with
blue
and
chattering
teeth
to
warm
themselves
with
breakfast
and
the
fire
so
alix
said
nothing
when
cherry
went
to
the
window
and
knelt
at
it
looking
out
into
the
redwoods
and
breathing
the
piney
air
in
the
silence
of
the
little
room
the
girls
could
hear
a
swollen
creek
rushing
rich
loamy
odours
drifted
in
from
the
forest
that
had
been
soaked
with
long
april
rains
cherry
saw
a
streak
of
light
under
the
door
of
hong
cabin
a
hundred
yards
away
there
was
no
moon
it
was
blackness
unbroken
under
the
trees
the
season
was
late
but
the
girls
felt
with
a
rush
of
delight
that
summer
was
with
them
at
last
the
air
was
soft
and
warm
and
there
was
a
general
sense
of
being
freed
from
the
winter
wetness
and
heaviness
alix
rolled
herself
in
a
gray
army
blanket
and
was
asleep
in
some
sixty
seconds
but
cherry
felt
that
she
was
floating
in
seas
of
new
joy
and
utter
delight
and
that
she
would
never
be
sleepy
again
downstairs
anne
and
the
doctor
sat
staidly
on
the
man
dreaming
with
a
knotted
forehead
the
girl
sewing
presently
she
ran
a
needle
through
her
fine
white
work
with
seven
tiny
stitches
folded
it
and
put
her
thimble
into
a
case
that
hung
from
her
orderly
workbag
with
a
long
ribbon
wait
a
minute
anne
said
the
doctor
as
she
straightened
herself
to
rise
this
young
lloyd
now
what
do
you
think
of
him
she
widened
demure
blue
eyes
should
you
be
sorry
if
i
liked
him
uncle
lee
she
smiled
the
old
man
rumpled
his
silver
hair
restlessly
he
said
a
little
ruefully
i
suppose
it
be
some
man
some
day
my
dear
i
been
thinking
even
little
cherry
seems
to
be
growing
up
anne
who
modelled
her
deportment
somewhat
upon
the
conduct
of
esther
in
bleak
house
came
to
the
hassock
at
his
knee
and
sat
there
looking
up
at
him
with
bright
affection
and
respect
cherry
only
a
child
she
assured
him
and
alix
will
not
be
ready
to
give
her
heart
to
any
man
for
years
to
come
but
i
uncle
and
sometimes
i
feel
ready
to
to
try
my
own
wings
he
smiled
at
her
absently
he
was
thinking
of
her
mother
an
articulate
academic
resolute
woman
of
whom
he
had
never
been
fond
that
the
way
the
wind
blows
eh
he
asked
kindly
anne
widened
her
pretty
eyes
well
you
see
how
much
he
here
you
see
the
flowers
and
books
and
notes
i
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
wear
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
anne
who
was
fond
of
small
conservational
tags
assured
him
merrily
but
there
must
be
some
fire
where
there
so
much
smoke
she
ended
you
not
sure
my
dear
he
asked
after
some
thought
oh
no
she
answered
it
just
a
fancy
that
persists
in
coming
and
going
you
know
uncle
lee
anne
pursued
confidentially
i
always
had
rather
a
high
ideal
of
marriage
i
always
said
that
the
man
i
would
marry
must
be
a
big
man
oh
i
do
mean
only
physically
i
mean
morally
mentally
a
man
among
men
and
you
think
young
lloyd
answers
that
description
eh
i
think
he
does
uncle
lee
she
answered
seriously
and
immediately
afterward
she
got
to
her
feet
saying
brightly
well
we
must
take
this
too
gravely
yet
it
was
only
that
i
wanted
to
be
open
and
with
you
uncle
from
the
beginning
that
the
only
honest
way
that
wise
and
right
her
uncle
answered
in
the
kindly
absent
tone
he
had
used
to
them
as
children
a
tone
he
was
apt
to
use
to
anne
when
she
was
in
her
highest
mood
and
one
she
rather
resented
cherry
now
he
asked
detaining
her
for
a
moment
she
you
think
that
perhaps
peter
admires
her
peter
anne
echoed
amazedly
and
stood
thinking
peter
was
more
than
thirty
years
old
thin
scholarly
something
of
a
solitary
the
sweet
dreamy
affectionate
neighbour
who
had
shared
the
girls
lives
for
the
past
ten
years
cherry
had
bullied
peter
since
her
babyhood
ruined
his
piano
with
sticky
fingers
trampled
his
coaxed
him
into
asking
her
father
to
let
her
sit
up
for
dinner
for
some
reason
she
could
not
or
would
not
define
anne
liked
the
idea
of
cherry
and
peter
falling
in
love
somehow
one
does
think
of
peter
as
marrying
any
one
she
said
slowly
still
trying
to
grasp
the
thought
he
so
she
added
shaking
her
head
you
you
would
like
that
uncle
peter
is
a
dear
fellow
the
doctor
mused
but
cherry
why
barely
eighteen
he
the
old
man
hesitated
began
again
i
suppose
there
no
reason
why
peter
should
kiss
her
in
a
brotherly
sort
of
way
he
submitted
doubtfully
did
he
kiss
her
anne
exclaimed
i
do
know
that
he
did
cherry
father
said
hastily
but
what
made
you
think
he
did
the
girl
persisted
just
a
fancy
he
assured
her
just
an
old
father
fear
that
she
is
growing
up
too
fast
because
we
all
and
you
especially
spoil
her
anne
reminded
him
smiling
peter
she
added
thoughtfully
has
kissed
us
all
now
and
then
she
stooped
for
a
dutiful
kiss
and
was
gone
and
as
she
went
lightly
and
swiftly
across
the
hall
up
the
stairway
with
her
shoulders
erect
and
methodically
and
prettily
moved
about
her
brushing
and
folding
and
disrobing
she
saw
herself
engaged
to
be
married
saw
herself
veiled
and
mystical
in
white
on
her
uncle
arm
heard
the
old
neighbours
and
friends
saying
that
little
anne
strickland
had
gone
to
her
own
home
and
had
won
the
love
of
a
fine
man
downstairs
the
doctor
sat
on
thinking
and
his
face
was
grave
he
was
thinking
of
little
cherry
goodnight
kiss
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
rested
against
his
arm
and
he
had
held
her
there
but
what
had
been
the
thoughts
behind
the
blue
eyes
so
near
his
own
perhaps
anne
was
right
perhaps
anne
was
right
but
he
realized
with
a
great
rush
of
fear
that
some
man
had
kissed
cherry
had
held
her
against
a
coat
and
that
the
girl
was
a
woman
and
an
awakened
woman
at
that
cherry
kissed
a
man
her
father
heart
winced
away
from
the
thought
young
lloyd
and
peter
had
walked
home
with
her
but
if
anne
was
right
in
her
maidenly
suspicions
of
lloyd
intentions
then
it
must
have
been
peter
who
surprised
little
cherry
with
a
sudden
embrace
lloyd
had
been
hurrying
for
a
train
too
the
case
looked
clear
for
peter
and
as
he
came
to
his
conclusions
a
certain
relief
crept
into
the
old
man
heart
peter
was
an
odd
fellow
he
was
ten
years
too
old
for
the
child
but
peter
was
a
lover
of
books
and
gardens
and
woods
and
music
after
all
and
peter
father
and
this
old
man
musing
by
the
fire
had
been
lee
and
paul
to
each
other
since
boyhood
peter
might
give
cherry
a
kiss
as
innocently
as
a
brother
in
any
case
peter
would
wait
for
her
would
be
all
consideration
and
tenderness
when
he
did
win
her
but
i
think
perhaps
she
might
go
down
to
the
san
jose
school
for
half
a
term
her
father
reflected
six
months
there
did
wonders
for
alix
no
use
precipitating
things
the
next
few
years
are
pretty
important
for
all
the
girls
we
must
let
her
fancy
that
the
first
man
who
turns
her
head
with
compliments
is
the
right
partner
for
life
alix
now
somehow
she
was
like
cherry
at
eighteen
he
smiled
at
a
sudden
memory
of
alix
who
was
at
that
age
and
generally
unpleasantly
redolent
of
incubators
chopped
feed
and
mire
he
seemed
to
remember
alix
shouting
that
if
peter
joyce
was
going
to
live
in
their
house
she
would
move
somewhere
else
cherry
was
different
cherry
he
reflected
fearfully
was
as
pretty
as
her
mother
had
been
at
eighteen
with
the
same
rounded
chin
and
apricot
cheeks
and
the
same
shadowed
innocent
blue
eyes
with
a
film
of
hair
blown
across
them
she
had
the
strange
the
indefinable
quality
that
without
words
almost
without
glances
draws
youth
toward
youth
draws
admiration
and
passion
draws
life
and
all
its
pain
her
father
for
the
first
time
formulated
in
his
heart
the
thought
that
she
might
be
happily
married
married
nonsense
why
what
did
she
know
of
life
of
submission
and
courage
and
sacrifice
at
the
first
strain
at
the
first
real
test
she
would
want
to
run
home
to
her
daddy
again
to
stop
playing
it
would
be
years
many
years
before
the
snowy
frills
and
the
pale
gold
head
and
the
firm
brown
little
hand
would
be
ready
for
that
not
many
hours
after
he
went
slowly
up
to
bed
morning
began
to
creep
into
the
little
valley
the
redwoods
turned
gray
and
then
dark
green
the
fog
stirred
and
a
first
shaft
of
bright
sunlight
struck
across
a
shoulder
of
the
hills
and
pierced
the
shadows
about
the
brown
bungalow
alix
at
her
early
bath
heard
quail
calling
and
looked
out
to
see
the
last
of
the
fog
vanishing
at
eight
and
to
get
a
wet
rush
of
fragrance
from
the
persian
lilac
blooming
this
year
for
the
first
time
at
eight
she
came
out
into
the
garden
to
find
her
father
somewhat
ruefully
studying
the
tumbled
ruins
of
the
yellow
banksia
rose
the
garden
was
still
wet
but
warming
fast
she
picked
a
plume
of
dark
and
perfumed
heliotrope
and
began
to
fasten
it
in
his
coat
lapel
while
she
kissed
him
we
never
get
that
back
on
the
roof
my
dear
boy
alix
said
maternally
her
father
pursed
his
lips
shook
his
head
doubtfully
the
rose
a
short
week
ago
had
been
spreading
branches
well
toward
the
a
story
and
a
half
above
their
heads
but
the
great
wind
of
yestereve
that
had
ended
the
spring
and
brought
in
the
summer
had
dragged
it
from
its
place
and
flung
it
a
jumble
of
emerald
leaves
and
sweet
clusters
of
creamy
blossoms
across
the
path
and
the
steps
of
the
porch
alix
looked
up
at
the
outward
curve
of
the
reversed
branches
bent
almost
to
the
splitting
point
in
the
unfamiliar
direction
and
whistled
she
tentatively
tugged
at
a
loose
spray
and
stood
biting
her
thumb
why
it
should
have
kept
its
place
for
fifteen
years
and
then
suddenly
flopped
is
a
mystery
to
me
she
observed
resentfully
well
the
truth
is
her
father
confessed
you
were
quite
right
last
night
when
i
pruned
it
a
week
ago
i
may
have
undermined
it
you
never
will
listen
to
reason
his
daughter
remarked
absently
her
attention
distracted
by
the
setter
puppy
who
came
clumsily
gambolling
toward
her
hello
old
bumpydoodles
she
added
with
rich
affection
kissing
the
dog
silky
head
and
burying
both
hands
in
his
feathered
collar
hello
old
buck
alexandra
for
heaven
sake
stop
handling
that
brute
said
peter
joyce
disgustedly
coming
up
the
path
i
dare
say
you
not
had
your
breakfast
either
go
wash
your
hands
doctor
father
and
daughter
turned
to
smile
upon
him
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
young
face
and
a
finely
groomed
head
and
with
touches
of
premature
silver
at
his
temples
he
was
very
much
at
home
here
had
been
their
closest
friend
for
many
years
he
was
a
bachelor
just
entering
his
thirties
a
fastidious
critical
exacting
man
by
reputation
but
showing
his
best
side
to
the
stricklands
they
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
was
rich
according
to
their
modest
standard
but
he
apparently
had
no
extravagant
tastes
and
lived
as
quietly
or
more
quietly
than
they
did
he
had
a
brown
cabin
up
on
the
mountain
where
two
or
three
portuguese
boys
and
an
old
fat
chinese
cook
managed
his
affairs
and
he
sometimes
spoke
of
friends
at
the
club
or
brought
two
or
three
men
home
with
him
for
a
visit
but
for
the
most
part
he
liked
solitude
books
music
dogs
and
his
fireside
the
old
doctor
one
social
enjoyment
was
in
visiting
peter
and
the
younger
man
went
to
no
other
place
so
steadily
as
he
came
to
the
old
house
under
the
redwoods
the
girls
accepted
him
unquestioningly
sometimes
resenting
his
frank
criticism
sometimes
grateful
for
the
entertaining
he
delighted
to
do
for
them
but
most
often
ignoring
him
as
if
he
had
been
an
uncle
whose
place
and
standing
in
the
domestic
circle
was
unquestioned
but
who
did
not
really
enter
into
their
young
plans
and
lives
he
was
whimsically
disapproving
of
alexandra
and
he
frankly
did
not
like
anne
but
he
had
always
been
especially
indulgent
to
cherry
and
had
taken
the
subject
of
cherry
schooling
and
development
very
seriously
and
cherry
treated
him
in
return
as
if
she
had
been
his
demure
and
mischievous
and
affectionate
daughter
peter
said
doctor
strickland
now
smiling
at
him
have
you
had
yours
my
house
said
joyce
fastidiously
is
a
place
of
course
alix
said
panting
from
her
welcome
to
the
dog
and
laughing
at
the
newcomer
without
resentment
of
course
it
is
for
the
president
emeritus
of
the
maiden
ladies
guild
is
running
it
do
be
insulting
peter
answered
in
the
same
mood
say
he
added
pursing
his
lips
to
whistle
as
he
looked
at
the
rose
tree
did
tuesday
wind
do
that
tuesday
wind
and
dad
alix
answered
will
it
go
back
peter
i
i
do
know
he
mused
walking
slowly
about
the
wreck
if
we
had
a
lever
down
here
and
some
fellow
on
the
roof
with
a
rope
maybe
lloyd
is
coming
over
alix
announced
peter
nodded
absently
but
the
mention
of
martin
lloyd
reminded
him
that
they
had
all
dined
at
his
house
on
the
very
evening
when
the
mysterious
gale
had
commenced
and
with
interest
he
asked
cherry
catch
cold
coming
home
tuesday
night
no
she
squeezed
in
between
dad
and
me
and
was
as
warm
as
toast
alix
answered
casually
how
you
like
mr
lloyd
she
added
nice
fellow
peter
answered
alix
grinned
she
had
before
this
accused
peter
of
violent
partisanship
with
his
own
sex
he
criticized
women
severely
the
strickland
girls
had
often
been
angry
and
resentful
at
his
comments
upon
the
insincerity
extravagance
and
ignorance
of
their
own
sex
but
with
peter
all
men
were
worthy
of
respect
until
otherwise
proved
he
awfully
nice
alix
agreed
who
is
he
peter
asked
curiously
where
are
his
people
and
all
that
his
people
live
in
portland
the
girl
answered
he
a
mining
engineer
and
he
waiting
now
to
be
called
to
el
nido
he
to
be
at
a
mine
there
he
lots
of
fun
when
you
know
him
really
talking
of
the
new
prince
charming
of
course
anne
said
joining
them
and
linking
an
arm
in
her
uncle
and
in
alix
arm
do
bring
that
puppy
in
alix
please
breakfast
uncle
lee
come
and
have
another
cup
of
coffee
peter
prince
charming
eh
peter
echoed
thoughtfully
as
they
all
turned
toward
a
delicious
drift
of
the
odour
of
bacon
and
coffee
and
crossed
the
porch
to
the
dining
room
i
was
going
down
for
the
mail
but
now
i
have
to
stay
and
see
this
rose
matter
through
thanks
anne
but
i
watch
you
afraid
of
getting
fatter
alix
speculated
shaking
out
her
napkin
you
are
fatter
she
added
with
a
calm
conviction
do
you
always
say
the
thing
that
will
give
the
most
offence
peter
asked
annoyed
where
cherry
he
added
glancing
about
cherry
answered
the
question
herself
by
trailing
in
in
a
japanese
wrapper
and
beginning
to
drink
her
coffee
with
bare
slender
arms
resting
on
the
table
nobody
protested
the
adored
youngest
was
usually
given
her
way
alix
indifference
to
the
niceties
of
her
toilet
had
been
seriously
combated
years
ago
but
cherry
was
so
young
and
so
pretty
in
any
dress
or
undress
that
it
was
impossible
to
regard
her
little
lapses
with
any
gravity
moreover
the
family
realized
perfectly
that
alix
would
have
clipped
her
thick
hair
and
taken
to
bloomers
or
knickerbockers
outright
at
the
slightest
encouragement
and
would
gladly
have
breakfasted
in
a
wrapper
or
in
her
petticoats
or
while
about
the
woods
with
her
dogs
whereas
nobody
could
know
cherry
and
not
know
that
every
weakness
of
which
the
feminine
heart
is
capable
for
frills
and
toilet
waters
creams
and
laces
was
dormant
under
the
childish
negligence
i
heard
you
all
laughing
under
the
window
and
it
woke
me
up
cherry
said
dreamily
it
seems
to
me
anne
who
had
been
eying
her
uneasily
said
lightly
that
someone
i
know
is
getting
pretty
old
to
come
downstairs
in
that
rig
when
strangers
are
here
it
seems
to
me
this
is
just
as
decent
as
lots
of
things
bathing
suits
for
instance
cherry
returned
instantly
gathering
the
robe
about
her
and
giving
anne
a
resentful
glance
over
her
blue
cup
peter
are
you
a
stranger
alix
said
if
peter
a
stranger
she
added
animatedly
what
is
an
intimate
friend
peter
walks
through
this
house
at
all
hours
you
ca
wash
your
hair
or
do
a
little
ironing
without
having
peter
under
your
feet
he
borrows
money
from
me
he
bullies
hong
about
wasting
butter
also
you
borrow
money
from
me
my
child
do
forget
that
peter
interrupted
serenely
peeling
an
apple
i
do
come
to
see
you
alix
i
have
a
rope
somewhere
the
doctor
ruminated
where
did
i
put
that
long
rope
what
did
i
have
it
for
in
the
first
place
you
had
it
to
guy
the
apple
tree
alix
reminded
him
do
you
remember
you
got
a
regular
ship
cable
to
tie
that
tree
and
it
never
worked
the
tree
that
died
after
all
ah
yes
said
her
father
his
attentive
face
brightening
ah
yes
now
where
is
that
rope
but
even
as
alix
observed
that
she
had
seen
it
somewhere
and
advanced
a
tentative
guess
as
to
the
cellar
his
eyes
fell
upon
cherry
and
went
from
cherry
absorbed
face
for
she
was
dreaming
over
her
breakfast
to
peter
and
he
wondered
if
peter
had
kissed
her
come
on
let
get
at
it
alix
exclaimed
with
relish
she
loved
a
struggle
of
any
description
had
prepared
for
this
one
with
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbows
and
had
put
on
heavy
shoes
and
her
briefest
skirt
come
on
sweetums
she
added
to
the
dog
who
had
somehow
wormed
his
way
into
the
dining
room
and
was
beating
the
floor
with
an
obsequious
tail
she
caught
his
forepaws
and
he
whipped
his
beautiful
tail
between
his
legs
and
looked
about
with
agonized
eyes
while
she
dragged
him
through
a
clumsy
dance
he
the
darlingest
pup
we
ever
had
alix
stated
to
cherry
who
was
departing
for
the
upper
regions
and
a
complete
costume
he
needs
a
bath
anne
observed
coldly
and
peter
abrupt
shout
of
laughter
made
alix
flush
angrily
bring
your
cigarette
out
here
peter
the
old
doctor
said
crossing
the
garden
to
look
in
the
abandoned
greenhouse
for
his
rope
we
in
no
hurry
he
said
we
may
as
well
wait
until
lloyd
comes
along
the
fellow
arms
are
like
flails
you
the
old
man
opened
a
reluctant
door
peered
into
a
glassed
space
filled
with
muddy
shelves
and
empty
and
spiderwebs
it
not
here
he
stated
then
he
began
again
you
brought
cherry
home
last
night
he
asked
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
peter
answered
in
his
quick
precise
tones
i
came
with
lloyd
and
cherry
as
far
as
the
bridge
then
i
cut
up
the
hill
why
he
added
sharply
what
up
nothing
up
doctor
strickland
said
slowly
but
i
think
that
lloyd
admires
or
is
beginning
to
admire
her
he
said
who
cherry
peter
exclaimed
with
distaste
and
incredulity
in
his
tone
you
do
think
so
the
doctor
looking
at
him
wistfully
asked
eagerly
why
certainly
not
peter
said
quickly
certainly
not
he
added
frowning
with
his
eyes
narrowed
and
his
look
fixed
upon
the
vista
of
woodland
i
had
a
fancy
that
he
might
have
been
putting
notions
into
her
head
her
father
said
anxious
to
be
reassured
but
great
scott
peter
said
his
face
very
red
she
much
younger
than
anne
and
alix
it
does
always
go
by
that
the
doctor
suggested
no
i
know
it
does
peter
answered
in
his
quick
annoyed
fashion
i
should
be
sorry
cherry
father
admitted
sorry
peter
echoed
impatiently
but
it
quite
out
of
the
question
of
course
it
quite
out
of
the
question
you
must
we
must
let
ourselves
get
scared
about
the
first
man
that
looks
at
her
she
she
would
consider
him
for
an
instant
he
suddenly
decided
in
great
satisfaction
you
must
forget
that
she
has
something
to
do
with
it
very
fastidious
cherry
she
not
like
other
girls
that
true
that
true
doctor
strickland
agreed
in
great
relief
they
turned
back
toward
the
garden
in
time
to
meet
alix
and
several
dogs
streaming
across
the
clearing
over
the
girl
shoulder
was
coiled
the
great
rope
she
leaped
various
logs
and
small
bushes
as
she
came
and
the
dogs
barked
madly
and
leaped
with
her
breathless
she
stumbled
and
fell
into
her
father
arms
and
both
men
had
the
same
thought
one
that
made
them
smile
upon
her
tomboyishness
indulgently
if
this
is
eighteen
is
three
long
years
younger
and
less
responsible
chapter
ii
immediately
they
gathered
by
the
fallen
rose
vine
all
talking
and
disputing
at
once
alix
and
the
dogs
added
only
noise
to
the
confusion
the
men
debated
measured
and
doubted
anne
busy
with
household
duties
came
and
went
smilingly
about
them
stretched
the
forest
wrapped
in
the
summer
morning
stillness
that
is
really
compounded
of
a
thousand
happy
sounds
there
was
no
fog
now
warm
spokes
of
sunshine
fell
brightly
into
the
dim
glowing
heart
of
the
woods
bees
and
birds
murmured
on
short
journeys
aromatic
sweetness
drifted
on
the
air
they
had
known
a
thousand
such
mornings
the
doctor
and
his
girls
still
exquisite
happy
dedicated
to
some
absurd
undertaking
they
had
built
chicken
pens
they
had
dammed
or
cleared
the
creek
they
had
felled
and
lopped
the
lower
branches
of
the
redwoods
they
had
built
roaring
bonfires
or
painted
the
porch
floor
and
many
times
they
had
roasted
chops
or
potatoes
at
the
brick
oven
and
feasted
royally
in
the
open
forest
a
light
rope
was
tied
an
experimental
tug
broke
it
like
a
string
tumbling
alix
violently
in
a
sitting
position
and
precipitating
her
father
into
a
loamy
bed
anne
who
was
bargaining
with
a
chinese
fruit
vendor
frankly
interested
in
their
undertaking
had
called
that
she
would
help
them
in
a
second
when
behind
alix
who
was
still
sitting
on
the
ground
another
voice
offered
help
a
young
man
had
come
into
the
doctor
garden
work
was
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
while
they
welcomed
martin
lloyd
he
was
tall
and
fair
broad
but
with
not
an
ounce
of
extra
weight
with
brown
eyes
always
laughing
and
a
ready
friendliness
always
in
evidence
he
was
dressed
becomingly
in
a
brown
army
shirt
open
at
the
throat
and
shabby
golf
trousers
that
met
his
thick
woollen
stockings
at
the
knee
anne
heart
gave
a
throb
of
approval
as
she
studied
him
alix
flushed
furiously
scowled
a
certain
boyish
approval
cherry
had
not
come
down
can
you
help
us
the
doctor
echoed
his
question
doubtfully
i
know
that
it
can
be
done
he
admitted
this
shameless
old
man
has
just
confessed
that
he
gouged
the
heart
out
of
the
poor
tree
a
week
ago
alix
said
getting
to
her
feet
the
first
use
he
put
his
birthday
knife
to
and
anne
stood
here
and
abetted
him
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
how
you
garble
things
alix
anne
said
giving
her
hand
to
martin
i
came
out
here
to
find
my
uncle
busily
pruning
and
chopping
the
dead
underwood
away
but
i
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
you
had
what
that
you
eating
an
apricot
martin
said
to
anne
in
his
laughing
way
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
it
was
a
peach
you
are
a
cannibal
oh
help
alix
ejaculated
with
a
look
of
elaborate
scorn
no
but
where
were
you
last
night
martin
added
in
a
lower
tone
when
he
and
anne
could
speak
unnoticed
the
happy
colour
flooded
her
face
i
have
to
take
care
of
my
family
sometimes
she
reminded
him
demurely
was
cherry
a
good
substitute
cherry
adorable
he
agreed
heartily
is
she
sweet
anne
asked
enthusiastically
she
only
a
little
girl
really
but
she
a
little
girl
who
is
going
to
have
a
lot
of
attention
some
day
she
added
in
her
most
matronly
manner
martin
did
not
answer
but
turning
briskly
toward
the
doctor
he
devoted
himself
to
the
business
in
hand
peter
had
climbed
on
an
inverted
barrel
to
inspect
and
advise
alix
dashed
upstairs
for
nails
and
hammer
the
doctor
whittled
pegs
martin
measured
the
comparative
strength
of
ropes
and
branches
with
a
judicial
eye
and
hand
anne
flitted
about
suggesting
commenting
her
pretty
little
head
tipped
to
one
side
they
were
all
deep
in
the
first
united
tug
each
person
placed
carefully
by
the
doctor
and
guys
for
the
rope
driven
at
intervals
decided
by
martin
when
there
was
an
interruption
for
cherry
arrival
on
the
scene
with
characteristic
coquetry
she
did
not
approach
as
the
others
had
by
means
of
the
front
porch
and
the
garden
path
but
crept
from
the
study
window
into
a
veritable
tunnel
of
green
bloom
and
came
crawling
down
it
as
sweet
and
fragrant
as
lovely
and
as
fresh
as
the
roses
themselves
she
wore
a
scant
pink
gingham
that
had
been
a
dozen
times
to
the
tub
and
was
faded
and
small
it
might
have
been
a
regal
mantle
and
diadem
without
any
further
enhancing
her
extraordinary
beauty
her
bright
head
was
hidden
by
a
blue
sunbonnet
assumed
she
explained
later
because
the
thorns
tangled
her
hair
but
as
laughing
and
smothered
with
roses
she
crept
into
view
the
sunbonnet
slipped
back
and
the
lovely
flushed
little
face
with
tendrils
of
gold
straying
across
the
white
forehead
and
mischief
gleaming
in
the
blue
blue
eyes
was
framed
only
in
loosened
pale
gold
hair
years
afterward
alix
remembered
her
so
as
martin
lloyd
helped
her
to
spring
free
of
the
branches
and
she
stood
laughing
at
their
surprise
and
still
clinging
to
his
hand
the
day
we
raised
the
rose
tree
had
a
place
of
its
own
in
alix
memory
as
a
time
of
carefree
fun
and
content
a
time
of
perfume
and
sunshine
perhaps
the
last
time
of
its
kind
that
any
one
of
them
was
to
know
cherry
looked
at
martin
daringly
as
she
joined
the
labourers
her
whole
being
was
thrilling
to
the
excitement
of
his
glance
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
was
doing
or
saying
under
her
father
direction
she
tied
ropes
presently
was
placed
with
her
arms
clasped
tightly
about
a
great
sheaf
of
vines
ready
for
the
united
tug
martin
came
close
to
her
in
the
general
confusion
how
my
little
sweetheart
this
morning
cherry
looked
up
her
throat
contracted
she
looked
down
again
unable
to
speak
she
had
been
waiting
for
his
first
word
now
that
it
had
come
it
seemed
so
far
richer
and
sweeter
than
her
wildest
dream
how
can
i
see
you
a
minute
martin
murmured
snapping
his
big
knife
shut
i
have
to
walk
down
for
the
mail
stammered
cherry
conscious
only
of
martin
and
herself
both
peter
and
her
father
were
watching
her
with
an
uneasiness
and
suspicion
that
had
sprung
into
being
both
men
were
asking
themselves
what
they
knew
of
this
strange
young
man
who
was
suddenly
a
part
of
their
intimate
little
world
he
was
simply
a
man
not
unusual
in
any
apparent
way
he
was
ready
with
his
words
fairly
clean
and
muscular
his
evident
lack
of
polish
in
languages
and
letters
atoned
for
by
his
quick
wit
and
by
a
certain
boyish
artlessness
and
ingenuousness
he
represented
himself
as
about
to
receive
an
excellent
salary
at
the
mine
at
el
nido
two
thousand
a
year
but
also
admitted
cheerfully
that
he
was
always
broke
he
had
distinguished
himself
at
college
but
had
left
it
after
only
two
years
upon
being
offered
a
promising
position
there
was
nothing
especially
to
admire
in
him
nothing
especially
to
blame
under
other
circumstances

and
the
doctor
might
have
pronounced
him
as
one
of
the
least
interesting
of
human
specimens
the
beauty
of
childhood
and
adolescence
were
gone
the
ripeness
given
by
years
and
suffering
was
wanting
martin
lloyd
was
just
as
he
himself
laughingly
remarked
one
of
the
fellers
peter
had
secretly
criticized
him
because
he
used
the
words
and
photo
and
but
in
justice
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
there
was
no
particular
significance
to
the
criticism
he
also
in
his
secret
heart
had
a
vague
dissatisfied
feeling
that
lloyd
was
a
man
who
held
women
as
a
class
rather
in
disrespect
and
had
probably
had
his
experiences
with
them
but
there
was
no
way
of
expressing
much
less
governing
his
conduct
toward
martin
by
so
purely
speculative
a
prejudice
the
young
man
had
dined
at
his
house
a
few
nights
ago
had
shown
an
admiration
if
not
an
appreciation
for
music
had
talked
with
sufficient
intelligence
about
political
matters
mining
and
what
else
photography
and
pullman
cars
and
the
latest
wreck
off
bolinas
just
the
random
conversation
that
was
apt
to
trail
through
a
country
dinner
he
had
told
a
chinese
joke
well
and
essayed
an
irish
joke
not
so
successfully
peter
somewhat
appalled
in
the
sunny
garden
struggling
with
the
banksia
decided
that
this
was
not
much
to
know
of
a
person
who
might
have
the
audacity
to
fall
in
love
with
an
exquisite
and
innocent
cherry
after
all
she
would
not
be
a
little
girl
forever
some
man
would
want
to
take
that
little
head
and
that
delicious
little
person
away
with
him
some
day
to
be
his
wife
and
suddenly
peter
was
torn
by
a
stab
of
pure
pain
and
he
stood
puzzled
and
sick
in
the
garden
bed
wondering
what
was
happening
to
him
listen
want
a
drink
alix
asked
coming
out
with
a
tin
dipper
that
spilled
a
glittering
sheet
of
water
down
on
the
thirsty
nasturtiums
rest
a
few
minutes
peter
dad
wanted
a
pole
and
lloyd
has
gone
up
into
the
woods
to
cut
one
and
where
cherry
peter
asked
drinking
deep
she
went
along
just
up
in
the
woods
here
alix
answered
dad
had
to
answer
the
telephone
but
they
going
to
yell
if
they
need
help
well
and
alix
panting
sat
down
on
a
log
are
we
going
to
do
it
we
ought
to
go
up
and
help
lloyd
peter
decreed
which
way
did
he
go
i
do
know
darling
alix
answered
leaning
back
crossing
her
ankles
and
yawning
but
they
be
back
before
you
could
get
there
they
been
gone
five
minutes
only
five
minutes
but
they
were
enough
to
take
cherry
and
her
lover
out
of
sight
of
the
house
enough
to
have
him
put
his
arm
about
her
and
to
have
her
raise
her
lips
confidently
and
yet
shyly
again
to
his
they
kissed
each
other
deeply
again
and
again
the
girl
was
a
little
confused
and
even
a
little
uneasy
as
he
continued
the
tight
grip
on
his
arm
about
her
and
her
upward
look
found
his
eyes
close
to
her
own
their
talk
was
incoherent
cherry
was
still
playing
coquetting
and
smiling
her
words
few
and
martin
having
her
so
near
could
only
repeat
the
endearing
phrases
that
attempted
to
express
to
her
his
love
and
fervour
you
darling
do
you
know
how
i
love
you
you
darling
you
little
exquisite
beauty
do
you
love
me
do
you
love
me
martin
murmured
and
cherry
answered
breathlessly
you
know
i
do
but
you
know
i
do
presently
he
selected
the
sapling
redwood
and
brought
it
down
with
two
blows
of
his
axe
the
girl
seated
herself
beside
him
helped
him
strip
the
trunk
their
hands
constantly
touching
the
man
once
or
twice
delaying
her
for
one
more
snatched
and
laughing
kiss
but
martin
you
been
engaged
before
cherry
asked
never
on
my
honour
but
yes
i
was
once
too
years
ago
i
want
to
tell
you
about
that
he
told
her
her
grave
face
bent
over
the
redwood
boughs
she
was
tearing
she
nodded
flushed
paled
he
had
met
this
girl
at
his
mother
do
you
see
and
she
was
a
cute
little
thing
do
you
know
her
name
was
dorothy
king
and
when
he
went
back
to
college
she
had
promised
to
write
do
you
see
but
she
had
written
for
weeks
and
then
she
had
written
to
say
that
she
was
engaged
to
another
man
a
man
named
named
he
had
forgotten
the
name
but
she
had
married
him
all
right
and
cherry
looked
up
laughing
almost
reproachfully
how
could
he
ever
forget
her
married
name
cherry
said
that
she
suspected
that
martin
had
really
cared
and
he
said
no
but
he
had
wanted
to
tell
her
about
it
all
the
same
because
knowing
her
had
made
him
want
really
to
be
honest
and
to
be
good
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
she
forgave
him
his
admiration
for
dorothy
king
and
said
that
she
knew
he
was
good
and
martin
said
that
he
was
going
to
make
her
the
happiest
wife
a
man
ever
had
dragging
the
stripped
tree
they
ran
down
the
sharp
hill
to
the
house
just
as
anne
came
out
to
announce
luncheon
peter
was
wandering
off
in
the
woods
nearby
but
came
at
alix
shrill
yell
of
summons
and
looked
relieved
when
he
saw
cherry
and
martin
not
even
talking
to
each
other
they
had
been
gone
only
ten
minutes
anne
who
did
not
like
peter
had
decided
not
to
ask
him
to
stay
but
peter
had
calmly
taken
his
usual
place
and
had
annoyed
anne
with
his
familiar
questioning
of
hong
as
to
the
amount
of
butter
needed
in
batter
bread
it
was
a
happy
meal
for
everyone
and
after
it
they
had
attacked
the
rose
bush
again
with
aching
muscles
now
and
in
the
first
real
summer
heat
it
was
three
before
with
a
great
crackling
and
the
scream
of
a
twisted
branch
and
a
general
panting
and
heaving
on
the
part
of
the
workers
at
last
the
feathery
mass
had
risen
a
foot
two
feet
into
the
air
had
stood
tottering
like
a
wall
of
bloom
and
finally
with
a
downward
rush
had
settled
to
its
old
place
on
the
roof
hong
was
pressed
into
service
now
and
with
martin
was
on
the
roof
grappling
with
a
rope
shouting
directions
a
shower
of
tiny
blossoms
and
torn
leaves
covered
the
steps
of
the
the
garden
beds
were
trampled
deep
the
seven
labourers
breathless
and
exhausted
but
the
rose
vine
was
in
place
alix
shouted
congratulations
to
martin
as
he
busily
roped
and
tied
the
recaptured
masses
in
their
old
position
anne
had
vanished
for
sandwiches
peter
was
being
scientifically
bandaged
by
the
doctor
cherry
stood
looking
up
at
the
roof
she
did
little
talking
she
watched
martin
during
every
second
he
spent
there
her
small
heart
was
bursting
with
excitement
he
had
found
easy
opportunities
to
talk
to
her
a
dozen
times
under
cover
of
the
general
noise
he
had
said
wonderful
and
thrilling
things
how
is
my
own
girl
sweetheart
you
the
sweetest
rose
of
them
all
cherry
do
you
suppose
they
can
see
from
our
faces
how
happy
we
are
little
sentences
that
meant
nothing
when
other
lips
spoke
them
but
that
his
voice
made
immortal
looking
up
at
him
she
thought
of
the
glorious
days
ahead
how
they
would
all
wonder
and
exclaim
yes
and
how
the
girls
would
envy
her
little
cherry
just
eighteen
going
to
be
married
and
married
to
a
man
that
alix
or
anne
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
win
a
real
man
from
the
outside
world
a
man
of
ten
years
older
than
she
was
and
how
the
letters
and
presents
and
gowns
and
plans
would
begin
to
flutter
through
the
bungalow
she
would
be
married
in
rajah
cloth
as
miss
pinckney
in
san
francisco
was
she
would
be
lloyd
she
could
chaperone
alix
and
anne
there
was
a
rending
slipping
noise
on
the
roof
a
scream
from
martin
and
shouts
from
the
doctor
and
peter
with
a
great
sliding
and
rushing
of
the
refractory
sprays
and
with
a
horrifying
stumbling
and
falling
down
came
martin
caught
in
a
great
rope
of
the
creeper
almost
at
her
feet
a
time
of
great
running
and
calling
ensued
cherry
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
him
and
had
his
head
on
her
arm
for
a
moment
then
her
father
took
her
place
and
alix
with
an
astonished
look
at
the
younger
wet
eyes
drew
her
sister
away
immediately
afterward
martin
sat
up
looked
bewilderedly
about
from
one
face
to
another
looked
at
his
scratched
wrist
and
said
gee
in
a
thoughtful
tone
anne
coming
out
with
sandwiches
joined
in
the
general
laugh
you
scared
cherry
out
of
ten
years
growth
alix
reproached
martin
i
i
thought
he
might
have
hurt
himself
cherry
said
in
the
softest
of
voices
and
with
her
shy
little
head
hanging
anne
decided
that
it
was
becoming
her
clear
duty
to
talk
to
cherry
my
dear
she
said
later
that
same
afternoon
when
by
chance
she
was
alone
with
her
little
cousin
do
you
think
perhaps
it
would
be
a
little
more
dignified
to
treat
lloyd
with
more
formality
he
likes
you
dear
of
course
but
a
man
wants
to
respect
as
well
as
like
a
pretty
girl
and
i
am
afraid
uncle
has
noticed
it
she
interrupted
herself
quickly
as
cherry
tossed
her
head
scornfully
he
spoke
of
it
last
night
and
alix
tells
me
that
you
are
calling
lloyd
now
dearie
martin
lloyd
is
fully
ten
years
then
alix
is
a
cherry
said
childishly
i
do
know
about
that
anne
said
gently
although
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
generous
in
her
to
add
that
alix
had
made
the
comment
gleefully
and
almost
admiringly
but
that
is
important
the
point
is
that
you
are
only
a
young
girl
i
wish
you
would
all
mind
your
own
royal
business
for
about
five
seconds
cherry
said
rudely
and
impatiently
she
was
in
her
own
room
rummaging
on
the
upper
shelf
of
the
closet
for
a
certain
hat
she
secured
the
hat
now
and
ran
unceremoniously
away
from
her
admonitor
to
join
alix
peter
and
martin
for
the
daily
ceremony
of
walking
into
the
village
for
the
mail
anne
followed
her
downstairs
sedately
perhaps
a
little
dashed
presently
to
discover
that
this
dignified
proceeding
had
lost
her
the
walk
they
were
all
gone
the
house
was
very
still
early
summer
sweetness
was
drifting
through
windows
and
doors
the
long
day
was
slowly
declining
in
the
woods
close
to
the
door
a
really
summery
hum
of
insect
life
was
stirring
hong
in
dull
minor
gutturals
jabbered
somewhere
in
the
far
distance
to
a
friend
anne
peeped
into
the
deserted
living
room
softened
through
all
its
pleasant
shabbiness
into
real
beauty
by
the
shafts
of
sunset
red
that
came
in
through
the
casement
windows
and
was
deliberating
between
various
becoming
occupations
for
martin
might
walk
back
with
the
girls
when
her
uncle
called
her
he
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
that
was
still
called
his
office
but
that
was
really
his
study
now
and
the
late
afternoon
light
through
the
replaced
rose
vine
streamed
in
on
the
shabby
books
and
the
green
lampshade
and
the
cluttered
desk
anne
you
were
there
when
that
young
chap
tumbled
but
i
been
worrying
about
it
a
little
there
no
question
there
no
question
that
she
that
cherry
called
him
by
his
name
she
called
him
anne
had
crossed
to
the
shadowy
doorway
she
stood
still
it
ca
be
protested
the
doctor
uneasily
did
alix
say
anything
to
you
about
it
she
said
that
anne
admitted
drily
you
not
noticed
anything
between
him
and
cherry
pursued
the
doctor
a
girl
might
call
a
man
by
his
name
i
suppose
i
do
think
there
has
been
anything
to
notice
anne
stated
in
a
level
tone
you
do
the
doctor
echoed
in
relief
peering
at
her
she
could
meet
his
look
with
a
smile
but
in
her
heart
were
the
same
thoughts
that
cherry
had
been
innocently
indulging
under
the
rose
vine
an
hour
ago
and
the
dream
that
had
been
heaven
to
cherry
was
purgatory
to
anne
cherry
married
cherry
receiving
cups
and
presents
and
gowns
cherry
lloyd
with
a
plain
gold
ring
on
her
young
childish
hand
cherry
able
to
patronize
and
chaperone
alix
and
anne
i
half
fancied
that
it
might
be
you
anne
her
uncle
added
although
i
know
what
a
sensible
little
head
you
have
i
afraid
i
a
trifle
exacting
where
men
are
concerned
anne
said
understanding
perfectly
that
her
pride
was
being
shielded
but
hurt
to
the
heart
nevertheless
well
it
must
be
stopped
if
it
has
begun
decided
her
uncle
i
ca
permit
it
i
forgotten
how
the
little
witch
grows
he
is
as
eligible
for
cherry
as
for
me
then
anne
asked
lightly
but
her
smile
disarmed
the
unsuspicious
old
man
and
he
answered
honestly
you
quite
different
anne
you
were
older
at
eighteen
than
be
at
you
could
hold
your
own
you
could
in
a
way
make
your
own
life
she
why
she
only
an
innocent
little
girl
she
got
dolls
in
the
attic
we
were
teasing
her
about
turning
up
her
hair
last
week
again
anne
was
silent
it
occurred
to
her
to
laugh
at
the
absurdity
of
these
quick
suspicions
but
they
had
already
seized
upon
her
with
the
curious
tenacity
of
truth
already
she
had
accepted
the
fact
that
what
yesterday
would
have
been
the
unbelievable
maximum
of
humiliation
and
hurt
was
true
and
less
than
the
whole
bitter
truth
she
was
not
in
love
with
martin
lloyd
she
was
not
as
susceptible
as
the
much
younger
cherry
and
she
had
not
had
his
urging
to
help
her
to
a
quick
surrender
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
seen
an
absolutely
suitable
man
a
man
whose
work
position
looks
name
and
character
fitted
her
rather
exacting
standard
and
for
the
first
time
she
had
let
herself
think
confidently
of
being
wooed
and
won
it
was
all
so
right
so
dignified
so
fitting
she
had
been
the
light
of
her
uncle
eyes
and
the
little
capable
keeper
of
his
house
for
years
she
had
been
reminding
her
own
friends
of
this
frequently
during
the
past
year
or
two
now
she
was
ready
to
step
into
a
nest
of
her
own
standing
there
in
the
doorway
she
tasted
the
last
bitter
dregs
of
the
dream
it
was
all
over
anne
was
at
the
age
that
sets
years
as
the
definite
boundary
of
spinsterhood
she
would
be
in
august
alix
came
in
from
her
walk
glowing
and
full
of
a
great
discovery
dad
she
said
eagerly
taking
her
place
at
the
supper
table
what
do
you
think
i
bet
you
a
dollar
that
man
is
falling
in
love
with
our
cherry
anne
at
the
head
of
the
table
looked
pained
but
there
was
genuine
apprehension
in
the
doctor
face
where
is
your
sister
he
asked
down
there
by
the
gate
alix
answered
they
gazing
soulfully
into
each
other
eyes
and
all
that
peter
went
home
but
cherry
with
a
beau
is
that
the
ultimate
extension
of
the
limit
i
crazy
about
it
i
think
it
great
an
engineer
dad
and
north
nephew
and
he
has
a
fine
job
in
a
mine
somewhere
she
summarized
enthusiastically
you
could
ask
anything
better
than
that
could
you
could
you
dad
i
love
weddings
this
be
the
third
i
been
to
all
this
seems
to
have
come
up
very
suddenly
the
doctor
said
dazedly
rumpling
his
gray
hair
with
a
fine
old
hand
i
do
imagine
your
sister
is
taking
it
as
seriously
as
you
and
anne
seem
inclined
to
oh
does
anne
think
so
alix
exclaimed
i
think
cherry
is
one
of
the
fortunate
girls
destined
to
drift
along
the
surface
of
life
anne
said
and
to
accept
wifehood
quite
simply
i
only
wish
i
were
that
type
oh
nancy
what
rot
you
talk
every
time
you
remember
you
had
a
year
at
college
alix
said
lightly
ca
you
let
the
poor
kid
fall
in
love
without
yapping
about
types
and
biology
and
the
cosmic
urge
really
alix
you
use
extraordinary
language
anne
remonstrated
glancing
at
her
uncle
with
outraged
dignity
and
i
am
not
aware
that
i
spoke
of
biology
or
the
cosmic
urge
but
her
tone
was
not
as
impersonal
as
her
words
and
she
was
flushed
and
even
agitated
we
begin
uncle
lee
she
asked
patiently
if
cherry
is
just
down
at
the
gate
there
she
only
be
another
minute
she
was
interrupted
by
cherry
herself
the
girl
came
to
the
porch
door
and
as
she
hesitated
there
a
minute
with
her
smiling
eyes
seeking
her
father
face
they
saw
that
by
one
firm
small
hand
she
drew
her
lover
beside
her
martin
lloyd
smiling
face
showed
above
hers
in
the
lamplight
dad
said
cherry
with
a
childish
breath
dad
i
brought
martin
to
supper
chapter
iii
the
three
at
the
table
did
not
move
for
perhaps
twenty
slow
seconds
doctor
strickland
who
had
pushed
back
his
chair
and
whose
hands
were
resting
on
the
table
before
him
stared
at
them
steadily
anne
with
a
quick
little
hiss
of
surprise
smiled
faintly
alix
the
unstilted
widened
her
eyes
and
opened
her
mouth
in
unaffected
astonishment
for
there
was
no
mistaking
cherry
tone
doctor
said
martin
coming
in
this
little
girl
of
yours
and
i
have
something
to
tell
you
the
old
man
looked
at
him
sharply
almost
sternly
looked
about
at
the
girls
faces
and
was
silent
but
he
tightened
his
arm
about
cherry
who
had
fluttered
to
the
arm
of
his
chair
are
you
surprised
daddy
cherry
laughed
with
all
a
child
innocent
exultation
the
next
instant
anne
and
martin
were
shaking
hands
and
alix
had
enveloped
cherry
in
an
enthusiastic
embrace
surprised
exclaimed
alix
why
are
you
surprised
yourself
her
sister
flushed
exquisitely
and
martin
laughed
we
just
about
knocked
silly
he
confessed
and
all
the
girls
laughed
joyously
there
followed
a
delighted
confusion
of
talk
when
each
in
turn
remembered
what
she
had
noticed
what
she
had
suspected
and
what
her
first
emotion
had
been
at
this
moment
or
that
meanwhile
a
place
was
made
for
martin
and
biscuits
and
omelette
and
honey
and
tea
were
put
into
brisk
circulation
cherry
left
her
place
beside
her
father
with
a
final
kiss
and
took
her
own
chair
all
dimples
flushes
smiles
and
shy
confidence
and
what
are
your
plans
anne
asked
maternally
as
she
poured
tea
her
uncle
who
had
been
silent
during
the
excitement
mildly
interposed
i
think
we
need
go
too
fast
young
people
you
only
known
each
other
a
few
weeks
after
all
you
must
be
pretty
sure
of
yourselves
before
taking
anything
like
a
decisive
step
plenty
of
time
plenty
of
time
lloyd
can
go
back
to
his
mine
and
cherry
will
wait
for
him
cherry
face
coloured
and
her
whole
body
drooped
but
i
can
be
getting
ready
and
i
can
tell
people
dad
she
pleaded
we
see
her
father
promised
her
soothingly
he
had
promised
her
thus
vaguely
when
as
an
imperative
baby
years
ago
she
had
wanted
the
impossible
but
she
was
not
a
baby
now
ah
now
that
wo
do
she
pouted
you
must
give
me
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
losing
my
baby
pretty
her
father
said
i
confess
that
this
thing
seems
to
have
come
upon
me
rather
unexpectedly
lloyd
here
and
i
must
have
some
talks
about
his
plans
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
doctor
martin
said
sensibly
and
sympathetically
i
realize
that
i
should
have
come
to
you
first
and
asked
to
pay
my
respects
to
your
daughter
laugh
why
do
you
he
added
to
alix
from
whom
an
abrupt
and
startling
laugh
had
indeed
escaped
in
scorn
nobody
does
that
any
more
the
girl
said
in
it
sounded
so
perhaps
nobody
does
it
any
more
but
i
should
have
done
it
martin
said
briskly
and
seriously
except
that
it
all
came
over
me
with
such
a
rush
a
week
ago
cherry
was
only
a
most
attractive
child
to
me
spoken
to
my
aunt
about
her
and
had
said
that
i
envied
the
man
that
was
some
day
to
win
her
and
that
was
all
then
the
time
came
for
me
to
get
back
to
work
and
i
found
i
could
go
i
could
leave
her
however
i
expect
to
be
back
here
some
time
in
the
fall
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
see
her
then
and
perhaps
then
and
then
came
last
night
when
i
began
to
say
and
it
happened
i
know
that
you
all
hardly
know
me
and
i
know
that
cherry
is
pretty
young
to
settle
down
but
i
think
i
can
satisfy
you
doctor
that
you
give
her
into
safe
hands
and
i
believe
she
never
regret
trusting
me
he
had
gotten
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
and
was
holding
the
back
of
his
chair
looking
anxiously
and
eagerly
into
the
old
man
eyes
his
tone
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
keep
it
light
had
taken
on
a
depth
and
gravity
quite
new
to
his
hearers
and
as
cherry
sitting
next
him
and
fired
through
all
her
girlish
being
by
his
eloquence
turned
to
lay
a
small
warm
hand
on
his
own
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
well
said
the
doctor
touched
himself
and
in
his
gentlest
tone
well
it
had
to
come
perhaps
i
ca
promise
her
to
you
very
soon
lloyd
but
if
you
both
are
willing
to
wait
and
if
time
proves
this
to
be
the
real
feeling
i
do
believe
you
find
me
hard
on
you
that
all
i
ask
sir
martin
said
resuming
his
seat
and
his
dinner
and
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
harmony
and
gaiety
reigned
alix
shot
an
occasional
glance
at
anne
who
was
flushed
but
as
usual
busy
and
charming
over
the
tea
cups
alix
knew
that
anne
was
inwardly
writhing
indeed
she
felt
a
sort
of
emotional
shock
herself
yesterday
the
mere
talk
of
a
lover
for
any
one
of
them
was
delightfully
thrilling
and
vague
cherry
was
actually
engaged
the
older
romantic
speculations
were
flat
enough
now
cherry
had
the
actual
thing
there
was
no
jealousy
in
alix
heart
as
there
definitely
was
in
anne
of
the
man
but
alix
felt
envious
of
the
superior
experience
why
he
would
kiss
cherry
no
man
had
ever
kissed
alix
cherry
would
be
the
admired
and
envied
girl
among
all
the
girls
married
at
eighteen
it
was
so
beautifully
flattering
and
satisfying
to
be
married
young
she
looked
at
her
father
face
a
troubled
face
he
was
watching
the
lovers
regretfully
he
did
not
disguise
it
their
quick
plans
the
readiness
with
which
they
solved
the
tremendous
problems
to
come
the
with
which
they
were
hurrying
toward
the
future
had
he
and
the
older
charity
been
like
that
years
ago
when
they
had
had
supper
at
her
mother
house
and
told
the
great
news
he
remembered
himself
an
eager
enthusiastic
lover
had
he
really
given
better
promise
then
than
this
handsome
young
fellow
was
giving
he
tried
to
remember
the
older
charity
mother
what
she
had
said
what
expression
her
face
had
worn
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
dimly
recall
reluctance
and
pain
and
gravity
in
that
look
after
dinner
cherry
and
martin
in
all
the
ecstatic
first
delight
of
recognized
love
went
out
to
the
wide
front
porch
where
there
were
wicker
chairs
under
the
rose
vines
alix
alone
laughed
at
them
as
they
went
anne
with
a
storm
in
her
heart
played
noisily
on
the
piano
and
the
doctor
after
giving
the
doorway
where
cherry
had
disappeared
a
wistful
look
restlessly
took
to
his
armchair
and
his
book
in
such
desolation
of
spirit
as
he
had
not
known
since
the
dark
day
of
her
mother
death
the
next
day
alix
and
the
engaged
pair
walked
up
to
invite
peter
to
a
tennis
foursome
on
the
old
blithedale
court
it
was
a
saturday
and
as
he
usually
dined
with
them
or
asked
them
to
dine
with
him
on
saturday
they
were
not
surprised
to
find
him
busy
with
a
charcoal
burner
under
the
trees
compounding
a
marvellous
dish
of
chicken
tomatoes
cream
and
mushrooms
or
to
have
his
first
words
a
caution
not
to
tip
things
over
if
they
wanted
any
dinner
his
chinese
cook
was
hovering
about
but
peter
himself
was
chef
stop
your
messing
one
second
alix
said
catching
him
by
the
arm
and
as
he
straightened
up
she
added
with
a
little
awkward
laugh
congratulate
these
creatures
they
they
going
to
be
married
why
do
you
congratulate
them
peter
gave
one
long
look
at
martin
and
cherry
who
stood
laughing
but
a
little
confused
and
too
in
the
grassy
path
with
a
shock
like
death
in
his
heart
he
realized
that
it
was
all
over
their
protection
of
her
their
suspicions
had
come
too
late
blind
child
that
she
was
she
was
committed
to
this
fascinating
and
mysterious
adventure
his
face
grew
dark
with
a
sudden
rush
of
blood
peter
hates
to
have
any
one
else
know
a
thing
before
he
does
alix
explained
this
later
but
he
went
to
them
quickly
and
shook
hands
with
martin
and
was
presently
reproaching
cherry
for
her
secretiveness
in
his
old
or
almost
his
old
way
of
course
nobody
to
know
dad
insisted
on
that
said
cherry
soft
proud
little
voice
did
you
suspect
yesterday
peter
alix
asked
tasting
the
sauce
and
bunching
her
fingers
immediately
afterward
to
send
a
rapturous
kiss
into
the
air
as
an
indication
of
its
deliciousness
yesterday
when
they
went
off
after
the
tree
i
mean
i
had
my
own
suspicions
he
returned
and
cherry
his
little
gay
lovely
cherry
laughed
happily
he
arranged
that
they
were
to
play
the
tennis
here
on
his
own
courts
and
later
dine
with
him
but
under
his
hospitality
and
under
the
golden
beauty
of
the
day
it
was
all
pain
pain
pain
it
was
agony
to
see
her
with
him
beginning
to
taste
the
rapture
of
love
given
and
returned
it
was
agony
to
have
the
conversation
return
always
to
martin
and
cherry
to
the
first
love
affair
when
they
wandered
away
to
the
brook
and
stood
talking
the
girl
head
dropped
her
cheek
flushed
but
her
face
raised
quickly
now
and
then
for
a
flashing
look
peter
felt
that
he
could
have
killed
this
newcomer
this
thief
this
usurper
of
the
place
that
he
himself
might
have
filled
dad
always
said
he
disapproved
of
long
engagements
alix
commented
amusedly
but
you
ought
to
hear
him
now
this
thing
he
wo
even
call
it
an
engagement
it
an
understanding
or
a
preference
is
to
be
a
profound
secret
and
cherry
to
be
before
any
one
else
but
ourselves
knows
your
father
is
quite
right
peter
said
sharply
in
his
most
elderly
manner
they
were
resting
after
the
first
set
and
cherry
and
martin
in
the
opposite
court
were
out
of
hearing
when
your
hair
gets
tossed
back
that
way
alix
observed
innocently
lots
more
gray
shows
i
think
you
turning
gray
pretty
young
peter
are
you
are
you
forty
yet
you
not
forty
are
you
i
peter
answered
briefly
my
father
was
gray
at
he
added
after
a
pause
i
have
a
gray
hair
alix
started
people
talk
about
the
first
gray
hair
peter
did
not
hear
her
there
was
beginning
of
a
little
hope
in
his
heart
girls
did
not
always
fulfill
their
first
engagements
did
not
often
do
so
in
fact
the
thing
was
a
secret
it
might
well
come
to
nothing
after
all
that
was
the
beginning
and
after
it
although
it
was
arranged
between
them
all
that
nothing
should
be
changed
and
that
nobody
but
themselves
should
share
the
secret
somehow
life
seemed
different
two
or
three
days
after
the
momentous
day
of
the
raising
of
the
rose
tree
martin
lloyd
went
to
his
mine
at
el
nido
and
the
interrupted
current
of
life
in
the
brown
bungalow
supposedly
found
its
old
groove
but
nothing
was
the
same
the
doctor
in
the
first
place
was
more
silent
and
thoughtful
than
the
girls
had
ever
seen
him
before
anne
and
alix
knew
that
he
was
not
happy
about
cherry
plans
if
the
younger
girl
did
not
he
sighed
sat
silently
looking
off
from
his
book
in
the
summer
evenings
fell
into
deep
musing
even
at
his
meals
with
alix
only
he
talked
of
the
engagement
and
she
knew
from
his
comments
his
doubtful
manner
that
he
felt
it
to
be
a
mistake
the
ten
difference
between
cherry
and
martin
distressed
him
he
spoke
of
it
again
and
again
in
june
he
sent
cherry
to
a
at
menlo
park
but
the
girl
came
back
after
the
third
day
i
have
any
fun
she
confessed
i
had
to
tell
olive
about
me
and
martin
i
mean
the
boys
there
were
all
kids
cherry
was
changed
too
and
not
only
in
the
expected
and
natural
ways
alix
thought
she
had
always
had
a
generous
share
of
the
family
devotion
but
she
entirely
eclipsed
the
others
now
her
daily
letter
from
martin
her
new
prospects
not
only
increased
her
importance
in
the
other
girls
eyes
but
innocently
inflated
her
own
she
received
a
diamond
ring
and
although
at
her
father
request
she
did
not
show
it
for
a
few
weeks
eventually
it
slipped
mysteriously
from
the
little
chamois
bag
on
her
neck
and
duly
appeared
on
her
left
hand
she
had
promised
to
keep
the
engagement
or
understanding
or
preference
a
profound
secret
but
this
was
impossible
first
one
intimate
friend
and
then
another
was
allowed
to
gasp
and
exclaim
over
the
news
the
time
came
when
anne
decided
that
it
was
not
decent
not
to
let
martin
aunt
know
of
it
when
all
these
other
people
knew
finally
came
a
dinner
to
the
norths
when
cherry
health
was
drunk
and
then
the
engagement
presents
began
to
come
in
but
it
july
now
cherry
said
innocently
and
i
think
we
were
pretty
smart
to
keep
it
a
secret
so
long
do
you
dad
and
been
engaged
three
months
now
so
that
it
looks
as
if
waiting
going
to
change
our
minds
does
it
he
could
not
chill
her
gay
confidence
he
had
always
spoiled
her
her
father
only
looked
tenderly
into
the
blue
eyes
and
tightened
his
big
arm
protectingly
about
the
slender
young
shoulders
but
he
was
deeply
depressed
there
seemed
nothing
to
say
cherry
was
of
age
she
was
sure
of
herself
she
was
truly
in
love
with
this
presentable
young
man
doctor
strickland
felt
that
he
did
not
know
martin
the
man
to
whom
he
gave
his
lovely
daughter
he
would
have
hoped
to
know
intimately
for
years
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
young
lloyd
it
was
only
mused
the
doctor
aghast
only
what
was
being
done
in
the
world
every
day
but
he
was
staggered
by
the
bright
readiness
with
which
all
of
them
cherry
martin
the
other
girls
accepted
the
stupendous
fact
that
cherry
was
to
be
married
she
was
quite
frankly
and
delightedly
discussing
trousseau
now
too
entirely
absorbed
in
her
own
happiness
to
see
that
the
other
girls
had
lives
to
live
as
well
as
she
did
anne
mind
if
she
divided
her
share
of
the
silver
from
theirs
did
alix
think
she
would
ever
want
any
of
mother
lace
i
got
my
cards
yesterday
she
said
one
day
i
was
passing
the
shop
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
the
woman
looked
at
me
so
queerly
she
said
john
martin
lloyd
are
these
for
your
mother
i
said
for
me
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
look
martin
says
in
letter
that
he
thinks
people
will
say
i
his
daughter
and
alix
he
says
that
you
are
to
come
up
to
visit
us
and
we
going
to
find
you
a
fine
husband
wo
it
be
funny
to
think
of
your
visiting
me
oh
and
anne
did
you
see
what
fairfax
sent
me
a
great
big
glorious
fur
coat
she
said
i
would
need
it
up
there
and
i
guess
i
will
it
not
new
you
know
she
says
it
is
the
real
present
but
it
can
be
cut
down
and
it
will
look
like
new
and
so
on
and
on
the
other
girls
listened
sympathized
and
rejoiced
but
it
was
not
always
easy
they
could
not
get
cherry
to
be
interested
in
any
of
their
plans
for
climbs
or
picnics
indeed
even
to
themselves
their
own
lives
seemed
a
trifle
dull
by
contrast
anne
as
usual
took
her
part
in
the
summer
activities
of
the
village
she
and
alix
put
on
their
white
gowns
and
wide
hats
and
duly
descended
to
strawberry
fetes
and
church
fairs
and
concerts
and
duly
laughed
disarmingly
when
old
friends
expressed
their
pleasant
suspicions
of
cherry
but
alix
voiced
their
feelings
one
summer
afternoon
when
she
was
sauntering
into
the
village
at
her
cousin
side
and
began
for
the
first
time
a
faint
criticism
of
martin
what
makes
dad
mad
alix
opined
is
that
martin
had
it
all
arranged
before
he
asked
him
took
advantage
of
dad
in
a
way
i
do
think
he
would
have
felt
so
if
they
both
were
kids
but
after
all
her
voice
fell
anne
she
began
hesitatingly
sometimes
when
north
says
so
gaily
that
martin
was
a
terror
in
college
and
kept
his
whole
family
worrying
i
feel
sort
of
sorry
for
cherry
she
does
know
as
much
of
life
as
we
do
alix
finished
soberly
i
know
anne
said
quickly
perhaps
a
little
glad
to
find
a
point
where
cherry
needed
sympathy
i
have
a
feeling
that
dad
thinks
alix
pursued
that
it
was
just
because
it
was
cherry
first
mean
that
cherry
waked
up
suddenly
do
you
know
it
was
as
if
she
said
to
herself
i
a
woman
i
can
get
kissed
and
get
married
and
all
the
rest
of
it
expressing
this
beautifully
stumbled
mix
i
often
wonder
uncle
lee
does
forbid
it
anne
said
she
had
never
had
even
a
flitting
thought
of
such
a
thing
before
but
she
spoke
now
as
if
the
engagement
had
had
her
heartiest
disapproval
from
the
first
oh
no
why
should
he
alix
remonstrated
martin
may
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
for
her
i
confess
the
girl
added
frankly
i
stand
his
aunt
i
always
used
to
like
north
too
but
lately
when
she
begun
to
tell
cherry
that
he
is
extravagant
and
she
must
save
his
money
for
him
and
that
he
often
been
in
love
before
but
this
time
she
sure
it
is
the
real
thing
and
that
martin
has
his
delicate
stomach
anne
laughed
out
in
a
merry
fashion
not
usual
with
her
of
late
oh
alix
she
did
oh
yes
she
did
and
it
makes
me
sort
of
sick
what
does
cherry
care
about
anybody
delicate
stomach
alix
fell
silent
broke
out
again
abruptly
anne
do
you
suppose
she
have
a
baby
anne
flushed
she
considered
this
remark
rather
indelicate
and
yet
she
liked
alix
recognition
of
her
superior
knowledge
of
the
subject
i
think
it
very
likely
she
answered
calmly
after
a
hesitation
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
answer
i
think
it
very
unlikely
she
does
know
anything
about
babies
alix
said
somewhat
worried
i
do
either
anne
confessed
with
honesty
her
brow
troubled
i
read
things
here
and
there
i
know
something
of
course
but
i
do
know
much
we
all
read
dickens
and
the
classic
myths
and
things
alix
submitted
and
of
course
she
went
with
us
the
day
dad
took
us
to
faust
is
that
about
all
there
is
to
it
nance
just
about
i
guess
anne
answered
briefly
both
girls
faces
were
red
they
had
rarely
touched
upon
these
and
kindred
subjects
in
their
talks
with
each
other
they
had
never
discussed
them
with
any
one
else
anne
liked
to
fancy
herself
rather
worldly
wise
alix
had
an
independent
brain
and
tongue
but
in
their
household
there
was
no
older
woman
to
illumine
their
confused
guessing
with
an
occasional
word
now
and
then
even
if
an
unusually
wholesome
life
had
not
distracted
their
attention
from
the
problems
raised
in
books
and
their
isolation
had
not
protected
them
from
the
careless
talk
of
other
girls
of
their
ages
august
brought
martin
and
more
changes
he
was
delighted
with
his
work
in
the
el
nido
mine
the
emmy
younger
and
everything
he
had
to
say
about
it
was
amusing
and
interesting
it
was
still
in
a
rather
chaotic
condition
he
reported
but
the
stuff
was
there
and
he
anticipated
a
busy
winter
he
was
to
have
a
cottage
a
pretty
crude
affair
in
a
few
weeks
right
at
the
mine
how
does
that
listen
to
you
he
asked
cherry
cherry
was
sitting
beside
him
at
the
dinner
table
on
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
she
was
thrilling
still
to
the
memory
of
his
greeting
kiss
its
fresh
odour
of
shaving
soap
and
witch
hazel
and
the
clean
touch
of
his
cheek
she
gave
her
father
a
demure
and
interrogative
glance
martin
following
it
immediately
sobered
just
what
is
your
position
there
the
doctor
asked
pleasantly
a
little
bit
of
everything
now
martin
answered
readily
and
respectfully
later
of
course
i
shall
have
my
own
special
work
at
present
i
doing
some
of
the
assaying
and
have
charge
of
the
they
want
me
to
make
myself
generally
useful
make
suggestions
take
hold
in
every
way
that
the
way
to
get
on
the
older
man
said
approvingly
cherry
looked
admiringly
with
all
her
heart
in
her
eyes
at
her
the
other
girls
were
impressed
too
martin
brought
a
new
element
something
masculine
and
modern
to
their
quiet
dinner
table
dad
and
peter
were
men
to
be
sure
but
they
were
different
they
were
only
a
little
more
dear
and
amusing
and
real
than
the
men
in
dickens
novels
long
familiar
and
beloved
in
the
household
but
martin
made
the
girls
feel
suddenly
in
touch
with
real
life
he
had
kissed
alix
and
anne
upon
arriving
and
they
liked
it
both
the
older
girls
in
fact
were
so
impressed
with
the
brilliancy
of
prospects
with
the
extraordinary
distinction
she
possessed
in
having
a
promised
husband
with
whom
to
walk
about
the
woods
and
to
talk
of
the
future
that
they
could
forgive
cherry
for
being
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
dream
her
new
name
her
new
state
her
new
clothes
and
home
and
position
filled
her
thoughts
and
theirs
martin
had
not
been
with
them
more
than
a
few
hours
before
the
engagement
was
openly
discussed
and
there
were
constant
references
to
cherry
marriage
it
was
a
cool
evening
and
after
dinner
they
all
gathered
about
the
fire
martin
and
cherry
murmuring
together
in
the
ingle
seat
and
the
others
only
occasionally
drawing
them
into
the
general
conversation
peter
and
the
norths
had
come
in
for
coffee
north
giving
cherry
a
maternal
kiss
as
she
greeted
her
alix
thought
that
she
had
never
seen
her
sister
look
so
pretty
cherry
was
wearing
a
new
dress
of
corduroy
velvet
with
a
deep
collar
and
cuffs
of
old
embroidery
that
had
belonged
to
her
mother
her
silk
stockings
were
brown
and
her
russet
slippers
finished
with
square
silver
buckles
but
it
was
at
the
lovely
face
that
alix
looked
the
earnest
honest
blue
eyes
the
of
the
young
cheeks
and
the
drooping
crown
of
shining
hair
somehow
a
few
days
later
wedding
plans
were
in
the
air
and
they
were
all
taking
it
for
granted
that
cherry
and
martin
were
to
be
married
almost
immediately
in
october
in
fact
the
doctor
at
first
persisted
that
the
event
must
wait
until
april
but
martin
reasonable
impatience
and
cherry
plaintive
but
why
daddy
were
too
much
for
him
why
indeed
cherry
mother
had
been
married
at
eighteen
when
that
mother
husband
was
more
than
ten
years
older
than
martin
lloyd
was
now
would
ye
let
it
go
on
peter
eh
the
doctor
asked
somewhat
embarrassed
one
evening
when
he
and
peter
were
walking
from
the
train
in
the
late
september
twilight
lord
do
ask
me
peter
said
gruffly
i
think
she
too
young
to
marry
any
one
but
the
mischief
done
now
you
ca
lock
a
girl
in
her
room
and
she
the
sort
of
girl
that
would
be
convinced
by
that
sort
of
argument
if
you
did
i
think
i
talk
to
her
her
father
decided
anything
is
better
than
having
her
make
a
mistake
i
think
she
listen
to
me
and
a
day
or
two
later
he
called
her
into
the
study
it
was
a
quiet
autumn
morning
foggy
yet
warm
with
a
dewy
woody
sweetness
in
the
air
before
we
decide
this
thing
finally
the
doctor
said
smiling
into
her
bright
face
before
martin
writes
his
people
that
it
settled
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
something
it
something
you
wo
like
to
do
my
little
girl
i
want
ye
to
wait
a
while
wait
a
year
it
was
said
he
watched
the
brightness
fade
from
her
glowing
face
she
lowered
her
eyes
the
line
of
her
mouth
grew
firm
wait
until
you
twenty
dear
that
young
enough
i
been
planning
a
full
winter
for
you
girls
i
wanted
to
take
a
house
in
town
entertain
a
little
look
up
a
few
friends
you
trust
me
cherry
i
only
ask
you
to
take
a
little
time
to
be
sure
dear
silence
she
shrugged
faintly
blinked
the
downcast
eyes
as
if
tears
stung
them
i
know
you
do
like
martin
dad
she
said
tremulously
no
no
my
darling
you
must
say
that
he
said
in
distress
i
like
him
very
much
i
think
he
a
thoroughly
fine
fellow
i
could
wish
just
with
an
old
father
selfishness
that
he
was
a
neighbour
that
he
did
plan
to
take
you
away
entirely
that
natural
before
i
give
him
the
thing
i
hold
most
precious
in
the
world
and
that
just
it
cherry
wait
a
year
or
two
and
perhaps
it
will
be
possible
to
establish
him
here
near
us
you
have
a
little
money
dear
and
martin
says
himself
that
he
would
much
prefer
office
work
to
this
constant
changing
marriage
is
a
great
change
anyway
everything
is
different
your
point
of
view
your
very
personality
changes
with
it
you
be
lonely
my
dear
you
miss
your
sister
and
anne
and
all
the
old
friends
there
are
cases
where
it
must
be
so
of
course
but
in
your
case
he
stopped
discouraged
she
was
sitting
opposite
him
at
the
shabby
writing
table
her
elbows
resting
upon
it
her
full
lips
pouting
with
disappointment
perhaps
the
one
phrase
of
her
new
plans
that
pleased
cherry
most
was
that
she
was
to
be
carried
entirely
away
from
the
familiar
atmosphere
in
which
she
would
always
be
little
cherry
and
subject
to
suggestions
and
criticisms
now
she
began
slowly
to
shake
her
head
ca
take
your
old
father
word
for
it
doctor
strickland
asked
it
is
that
dad
she
protested
eagerly
and
affectionately
wait
i
have
waited
i
wait
until
christmas
or
april
if
you
say
so
but
it
wo
make
any
difference
nothing
will
i
love
him
and
he
loves
me
and
we
always
will
you
do
know
cherry
went
on
with
suddenly
watering
eyes
you
do
know
what
this
summer
of
separation
has
meant
to
us
both
if
we
must
wait
longer
why
we
will
of
course
but
it
will
mean
that
never
have
a
happy
instant
it
will
mean
that
i
am
just
living
along
somehow
oh
i
wo
cry
she
interrupted
smiling
with
wet
lashes
i
try
to
bear
it
decently
but
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
bear
it
a
rush
of
tears
choked
her
she
groped
for
a
handkerchief
and
felt
as
she
had
felt
so
many
times
her
father
handkerchief
pressed
into
her
hand
the
doctor
sighed
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
so
he
gave
cherry
a
wedding
check
that
made
her
dance
with
joy
and
there
was
no
more
seriousness
there
were
gowns
dinners
and
presents
every
day
brought
its
new
surprise
and
new
delight
to
cherry
she
had
her
rajah
silk
but
her
sister
and
cousin
persuaded
her
to
be
married
in
white
and
it
was
their
hands
that
dressed
the
first
bride
when
the
great
day
came
and
fastened
over
her
hair
her
mother
lace
veil
it
was
a
day
of
soft
sweetness
not
too
brightly
summery
but
warm
and
still
under
the
trees
until
ten
the
mountain
and
the
tops
of
the
redwoods
were
tangled
in
scarfs
of
white
fog
then
the
mellow
sunlight
pierced
it
with
sudden
spectacular
brightening
and
lifting
the
little
brown
house
was
full
of
flowers
and
laughter
and
coming
and
going
anne
and
alix
flushed
and
excited
in
their
bridesmaids
gowns
were
nervous
and
tired
they
had
made
lists
and
addressed
envelopes
had
decorated
the
house
had
talked
to
milliners
and
florists
and
caterers
and
dressmakers
had
packed
and
repacked
cherry
trunk
and
boxes
cherry
was
tired
and
excited
too
but
had
no
realization
of
it
she
was
carried
along
upon
a
roseate
cloud
of
happiness
and
excitement
martin
mother
and
stepfather
had
come
down
from
portland
and
were
friendly
and
pleased
with
everything
his
mother
alix
told
peter
is
the
sort
of
handsome
person
who
keeps
a
and
marries
a
rich
adoring
old
klondike
man
is
that
what
she
did
peter
whispered
amused
she
only
sixteen
years
older
than
martin
is
alix
confided
further
she
kissed
cherry
and
said
just
a
baby
doll
that
what
you
are
and
he
calls
me
and
cherry
they
got
two
little
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
dad
likes
them
both
well
that
good
peter
approved
does
cherry
oh
anything
that
belongs
to
martin
is
perfect
alix
answered
in
indulgent
scorn
as
she
abruptly
departed
to
see
to
some
detail
concerning
the
carriages
the
music
or
the
breakfast
she
and
anne
were
in
a
constant
state
of
worry
during
the
morning
their
plans
for
seating
two
score
of
persons
were
changed
twenty
times
they
conspired
in
agitated
whispers
behind
doors
and
in
the
pantry
but
the
first
wedding
went
well
at
twelve
charity
strickland
became
charity
lloyd
and
was
kissed
and
toasted
and
congratulated
until
her
lovely
little
face
was
burning
with
colour
and
her
blue
eyes
were
bewildered
with
fatigue
she
stood
in
the
doorway
her
bouquet
with
its
trailing
ribbons
in
her
gloved
hands
and
as
each
one
of
all
the
old
friends
and
neighbours
made
some
little
speech
of
an
amusing
or
emotional
nature
she
met
it
with
a
receptive
word
or
smile
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
did
or
said
sometimes
she
freed
her
feet
from
the
folds
of
her
lacy
train
and
sometimes
gave
martin
a
glance
backward
and
upward
over
her
shoulder
once
asking
him
to
hold
her
flowers
with
a
smile
that
several
guests
afterward
remarked
showed
that
those
two
could
see
anything
in
the
world
but
each
other
at
two
there
were
cherry
had
changed
the
wedding
satin
for
the
rajah
silk
then
and
wore
the
extravagant
hat
it
would
be
many
years
before
she
would
spend
dollars
for
a
hat
again
and
never
again
would
she
see
bronzed
cocks
feathers
against
bronzed
straw
without
remembering
the
clean
little
bedroom
and
the
hour
in
which
she
had
pinned
her
wedding
hat
over
her
fair
hair
and
had
gone
demure
and
radiant
and
confident
to
meet
her
husband
in
the
old
hallway
she
was
confusedly
kissed
passed
from
hand
to
hand
was
conscious
with
a
sort
of
strange
aching
at
her
heart
that
she
was
not
only
far
from
saying
the
usual
things
in
farewell
but
was
actually
far
from
feeling
them
she
laughed
at
alix
last
nonsense
promised
to
write
would
say
would
see
them
all
soon
was
coming
martin
and
so
a
last
kiss
for
darling
dad
and
and
so
many
thanks
and
thanks
to
them
all
she
was
gone
with
her
the
uncertain
autumn
sunshine
vanished
and
a
shadow
fell
on
the
forest
the
mountain
above
the
valley
was
blotted
out
with
fog
the
brown
house
seemed
dark
and
empty
when
the
last
guests
had
loitered
away
and
the
last
caterer
had
gathered
up

prosaically
making

for
dinner
pyramids
of
sandwiches
and
little
cakes
stood
on
the
sideboard
up
in
cherry
room
there
was
a
litter
of
tissue
papers
and
pins
and
powder
were
strewn
on
the
bureau
the
bed
was
mashed
and
disordered
by
the
weight
of
guests
hats
and
wraps
that
had
lain
there
a
heap
of
cards
still
attached
to
ribbons
and
wires
were
gathered
on
the
to
be
sent
after
cherry
and
remind
her
of
the
donours
of
gifts
and
flowers
across
the
lower
bed
that
had
been
cherry
a
pale
blue
japanese
wrapper
had
been
flung
the
girls
had
seen
her
wear
it
a
hundred
times
she
had
slipped
into
it
to
change
her
gown
a
few
hours
ago
anne
excited
and
tired
picked
it
up
stared
vaguely
at
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
and
began
to
cry
alix

muscles
about
her
mouth
twitching

watching
her
funerals
are
gay
compared
to
the
way
a
wedding
feels

said
finally
i
eaten
so
much
candy
and
and
olives
and
marrons
and
whipped
cream
and
crab

that
my

feels
like
the
barrel
of
a
musical
box
i
going
to
take
a
walk

no
i
do
want

anne
said
wiping
her
eyes
and
sitting
back
on
her
heels
with
a
long
sigh
and
sniff
i
got
too
much
to
do
alix
descended
to
find
her
father
and
peter
discussing
on
the
porch
steps
the
doctor
had
changed
his
unwonted
wedding
finery
for
his
shabby
old
smoking
jacket
but
peter
still
looked
unnaturally
well
dressed
alix
stepped
down
to
sit
between
them
and
her
father
arm
went
about
her
she
snuggled
against
him
in
an
unusual
mood
of
tenderness
and
quiet
be
nice
to
me
she
said
whimsically
i
lonely
h
her
father
said
significantly
tightening
his
arm
peter
moved
up
on
the
other
side
and
locked
his
own
arm
in
her
free
one
and
so
they
sat
silent
depressed
their
shoulders
touching
their
sombre
eyes
fixed
upon
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
forest
into
which
an
october
fog
was
softly
and
noiselessly
creeping
chapter
iv
meanwhile
the
hot
train
sped
on
and
the
drab
autumn
country
flew
by
the
windows
and
still
the
bride
sat
wrapped
in
her
dream
smiling
musing
rousing
herself
to
notice
the
scenery
the
lap
of
the
gown
held
magazines
and
a
box
of
candy
and
in
the
rack
above
her
head
were
the
new
camera
and
the
new
umbrella
and
the
new
suitcase
when
martin
asked
her
if
she
liked
to
be
a
married
woman
travelling
with
her
husband
she
smiled
and
said
that
it
seemed
funny
for
the
most
part
she
was
silent
pleased
and
interested
but
not
quite
her
usual
unconcerned
self
she
and
alix
taking
this
trip
would
have
been
chattering
like
magpies
she
and
martin
had
their
dinner
in
the
train
and
then
she
did
brighten
trying
to
pierce
with
her
eyes
the
darkness
outside
and
getting
only
a
lovely
reflected
face
under
bronzed
cocks
feathers
instead
after
dinner
they
had
a
long
murmured
talk
she
began
to
droop
sleepily
now
although
even
this
long
day
had
not
paled
her
cheeks
or
visibly
tired
her
at
ten
they
stumbled
out
cramped
and
and
smitten
on
tired
foreheads
with
a
rush
of
icy
mountain
air
is
this
the
yawned
cherry
clinging
to
his
arm
this
is
the
place
baby
girl
el
nido
and
not
much
of
a
place
her
husband
told
her
that
the
hotel
mckinley
over
there
where
the
lights
are
we
stay
there
and
drive
out
to
the
mine
i
manage
the
bags
but
do
you
stumble
she
was
now
looking
alertly
about
her
at
the
dark
streets
of
the
little
town
mud
squelched
beneath
their
feet
planks
tilted
beside
martin
cherry
entered
the
bright
cheerful
lobby
of
a
cheap
hotel
where
men
were
smoking
and
spitting
she
was
beside
him
at
the
desk
and
saw
him
write
on
the
register
lloyd
and
wife
the
clerk
pushed
a
key
across
the
counter
martin
guided
her
to
a
rattling
elevator
she
had
a
fleeting
thought
of
home
of
dad
reading
before
the
fire
of
the
little
brown
room
upstairs
with
alix
slender
in
her
thin
nightgown
yawning
over
her
prayers
a
rush
of
reluctance
of
strangeness
of
something
like
terror
smote
her
she
fought
the
homesickness
down
resolutely
everything
would
seem
brighter
when
the
morning
and
the
sunshine
came
again
there
was
a
brown
and
red
carpet
in
the
oblong
of
the
room
and
a
brown
bureau
and
a
wide
iron
bed
with
a
limp
spread
and
a
peeling
brown
washstand
with
a
pitcher
and
basin
the
boy
lighted
a
flare
of
electric
lights
which
made
the
chocolate
and
gold
wallpaper
look
like
one
pattern
in
the
light
and
another
in
the
shadow
a
man
laughed
in
the
adjoining
room
the
voice
seemed
very
near
cherry
had
never
been
in
a
hotel
of
this
sort
before
she
learned
later
that
el
nido
was
extremely
proud
of
it
with
its
rattling
elevator
and
its
dining
room
on
the
american
plan
it
seemed
to
her
cheap
and
horrible
she
did
not
want
to
stay
in
this
room
and
martin
tipping
the
boy
and
asking
for
seemed
somehow
a
part
of
this
new
strangeness
and
crudeness
she
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
would
think
she
was
silly
presently
if
she
said
her
prayers
as
usual
in
the
morning
martin
hired
a
phaeton
and
they
drove
out
to
the
mine
it
had
rained
in
the
night
and
there
were
pools
of
water
on
the
soft
dirt
road
but
the
sky
was
high
and
blue
and
the
air
tingled
with
sweetness
and
freshness
after
the
shower
cherry
had
had
a
good
breakfast
and
was
wearing
a
new
gown
they
stopped
another
phaeton
on
the
long
pleasant
drive
and
martin
said
to
the
fat
man
in
it
bates
i
want
to
make
you
acquainted
with
my
wife
pleased
to
meet
you
mrs
lloyd
said
the
fat
man
pleasantly
martin
told
cherry
when
they
passed
him
that
that
was
the
superintendent
of
the
mine
and
seemed
pleased
at
the
encounter
and
cherry
smiled
up
at
the
blue
sky
and
felt
the
warmth
and
silence
of
the
day
saturate
her
whole
being
presently
martin
put
his
arm
about
her
and
the
bay
horse
dawdled
along
at
his
own
sweet
will
while
martin
deep
voice
told
his
wife
over
and
over
again
how
adorable
and
beautiful
she
was
and
how
he
loved
her
cherry
listened
happily
and
for
a
little
while
the
old
sense
of
pride
and
achievement
came
back
she
was
married
she
was
wearing
a
plain
gold
ring
but
after
a
few
days
that
feeling
vanished
forever
and
instead
it
began
to
seem
strange
to
her
that
she
had
ever
been
anything
else
than
martin
wife
the
other
women
at
the
mine
were
married
she
was
married
and
nobody
seemed
to
think
the
thing
remarkable
in
them
or
in
her
she
was
to
be
sure
younger
and
prettier
than
any
of
the
others
but
the
men
she
met
here
were
not
the
sort
whose
admiration
would
have
satisfied
her
innocent
ambition
to
have
martin
friends
flock
about
her
adoringly
and
more
than
that
they
knew
her
to
be
newly
married
and
left
the
young
lloyds
to
their
presumably
desired
isolation
and
very
soon
cherry
found
herself
a
little
housewife
among
other
housewives
much
more
praised
if
she
made
a
good
shortcake
than
because
the
tilt
of
her
new
hat
was
becoming
for
several
days
she
and
martin
laughed
incessantly
and
praised
each
other
incessantly
while
they
experimented
with
cooking
and
ate
delicious
gipsy
meals
in
these
days
martin
was
always
late
at
the
mine
and
every
evening
he
came
home
to
find
that
ducks
or
a
jar
of
honey
or
a
loaf
of
cake
had
been
contributed
to
cherry
dinner
by
the
interested
women
in
the
cottages
in
all
there
were
not
a
dozen
families
at
the
emmy
younger
and
cherry
was
watched
with
interest
and
sympathy
during
her
first
efforts
at
housekeeping
by
midwinter
she
had
settled
down
to
the
business
of
life
buying
bacon
and
lard
and
sugar
and
matches
at
the
store
of
the
mine
cooking
and
cleaning
sweeping
and
making
beds
she
still
kissed
martin
every
morning
and
met
him
with
an
affectionate
rush
at
the
door
when
he
came
home
and
they
played
five
hundred
evening
after
evening
after
dinner
quarrelling
for
points
and
laughing
at
each
other
while
rain
sluiced
down
on
the
emmy
younger
and
dripped
on
the
porch
but
sometimes
she
wondered
how
it
had
all
come
about
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
violent
emotions
that
had
picked
her
out
of
the
valley
home
and
established
her
here
in
this
strange
place
with
this
man
she
had
never
seen
a
year
ago
of
these
emotions
little
was
left
she
still
liked
martin
she
told
herself
and
she
still
told
him
that
she
loved
him
but
she
knew
she
did
not
love
him
and
in
such
an
association
as
theirs
there
can
be
no
liking
her
thoughts
rarely
rested
on
him
she
was
either
thinking
of
the
prunes
that
were
soaking
the
firewood
that
was
running
low
the
towels
that
a
wet
breeze
was
blowing
on
the
line
or
she
was
far
away
drifting
in
vague
realms
where
feelings
entirely
strange
to
this
bare
little
mining
camp
and
this
hungry
busy
commonplace
man
held
sway
cherry
was
in
the
position
of
a
leading
lady
mysteriously
forced
into
a
minor
role
she
had
never
known
what
she
wanted
in
life
and
was
learning
now
in
a
hard
school
the
first
time
that
she
quarrelled
with
martin
she
cried
for
an
entire
day
with
the
old
childish
feeling
that
somehow
her
crying
mattered
somehow
her
abandonment
to
grief
would
help
to
straighten
affairs
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
was
a
trifle
her
father
had
sent
her
a
christmas
check
and
she
immediately
sent
to
a
san
francisco
shop
for
a
clock
that
had
taken
her
fancy
months
before
martin
who
chanced
to
be
pressed
for
money
although
she
did
not
know
it
was
thunderstruck
upon
discovering
that
she
had
actually
disposed
of
fifty
dollars
so
lightly
for
several
days
a
shadow
hung
over
their
intercourse
and
when
the
clock
came
as
large
as
a
banjo
gilded
and
quaint
he
broke
her
heart
afresh
by
pretending
not
to
admire
it
but
on
christmas
eve
he
was
delayed
at
the
mine
and
cherry
smitten
suddenly
with
the
bitterness
of
having
their
first
christmas
spoiled
in
this
way
sat
up
for
him
huddled
in
her
silk
wrapper
by
the
stove
she
was
awakened
by
feeling
herself
lowered
tenderly
into
bed
and
raised
warm
arms
to
clasp
his
neck
and
they
kissed
each
other
the
little
house
was
warm
and
comfortable
they
had
a
turkey
to
roast
on
the
morrow
and
ranged
on
the
table
were
the
home
boxes
and
a
stack
of
unopened
envelopes
waiting
for
christmas
morning
the
next
day
they
laughed
at
the
clock
together
and
after
that
peace
reigned
for
several
weeks
but
it
was
inevitable
that
another
quarrel
should
come
and
then
another
cherry
was
young
and
undisciplined
perhaps
not
more
selfish
than
other
girls
of
her
age
but
and
unreasonable
she
had
to
learn
and
she
hated
to
control
herself
she
had
to
economize
when
poverty
possessed
neither
picturesqueness
nor
interest
they
were
always
several
weeks
late
in
the
payment
of
domestic
bills
and
these
recurring
reminders
of
money
stringency
maddened
cherry
sometimes
she
summed
it
up
with
angry
tears
reminding
him
that
she
was
still
wearing
her
trousseau
dresses
and
had
no
maid
and
never
went
anywhere
but
she
developed
steadily
as
she
grew
skilful
in
managing
her
little
house
she
also
grew
in
the
art
of
managing
her
husband
and
herself
she
became
clever
at
avoiding
causes
of
disagreement
she
listened
nodded
agreed
with
a
boiling
heart
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
martin
viewpoint
veer
the
next
day
or
the
next
hour
to
meet
her
own
secret
conviction
martin
opinion
she
told
herself
wearily
as
she
swept
and
cooked
and
marketed
busily
did
matter
anyhow
he
would
rage
and
storm
at
his
superiors
he
would
threaten
and
brood
and
then
it
would
all
be
forgotten
time
after
time
after
time
silent
looking
closely
at
a
burn
upon
her
smooth
arm
or
pleating
her
checked
apron
cherry
would
sit
opposite
him
at
his
late
lunch
i
suppose
you
do
agree
with
me
he
would
interrupt
himself
to
ask
scowlingly
mart
the
innocent
blue
eyes
would
be
raised
vaguely
i
do
know
anything
about
it
dear
if
taylor
well
you
know
what
i
tell
you
do
you
yes
dear
but
for
god
sake
do
call
me
dear
when
you
mart
her
dignity
always
rose
in
arms
please
do
get
excited
well
his
tone
would
be
modified
as
the
appetizing
little
meal
was
dispatched
but
lord
you
do
make
me
so
mad
sitting
there
criticizing
me
i
can
always
tell
when
you
in
sympathy
with
me
my
lord
i
wish
you
had
to
go
up
against
these
fellows
sometimes
the
grumbling
voice
would
go
on
and
on
cherry
would
pause
at
the
door
carrying
out
plates
to
have
him
finish
a
phrase
would
nod
sympathizingly
as
she
set
his
dessert
before
him
but
her
soul
was
like
some
living
thing
spun
into
a
cocoon
hearing
the
sounds
of
life
only
vaguely
interested
in
them
not
at
all
martin
seemed
satisfied
and
all
their
little
world
accepted
her
as
a
matter
of
course
pretty
little
lloyd
went
every
morning
into
the
company
store
as
the
only
store
at
the
mine
was
called
and
smiled
over
her
shopping
she
stopped
perhaps
at
the
office
to
speak
to
her
husband
she
met
some
other
woman
wheeling
a
baby
up
to
the
cottages
and
they
gossiped
together
she
and
her
husband
dined
and
played
cards
now
and
then
with
a
neighbour
and
his
wife
and
they
gave
dinners
in
return
when
the
men
praised
every
dish
extravagantly
and
the
woman
laughed
at
their
greedy
enthusiasms
like
the
other
women
she
had
her
small
domestic
ambitions
brown
wanted
a
white
one
desire
was
to
have
a
curly
maple
bedroom
set
lloyd
wanted
a
standing
mahogany
lamp
for
the
sitting
room
but
under
it
all
cherry
knew
that
something
young
and
irresponsible
and
confident
in
her
had
been
killed
she
never
liked
to
think
of
the
valley
of
the
fogs
and
the
spokes
of
sunlight
under
the
redwood
aisles
of
alix
and
the
dogs
and
the
dreamy
evenings
by
the
fire
and
especially
she
did
not
like
to
think
of
that
eighteenth
birthday
and
herself
thrilling
and
ecstatic
because
the
strange
young
man
from
north
had
stared
at
her
in
her
sticky
apron
with
so
new
and
disturbing
a
smile
in
his
eyes
chapter
v
so
winter
passed
at
the
mine
and
at
the
brown
house
under
the
shoulder
of
tamalpais
alix
still
kept
her
bedroom
windows
open
but
the
rain
tore
in
and
anne
protested
at
the
ensuing
stains
on
the
pantry
ceiling
creeks
rushed
swollen
and
yellow
fog
smothered
the
mountain
peak
the
forest
floor
oozed
moisture
spring
came
reluctantly
muddy
boots
cluttered
the
doctor
hearth
for
he
and
alix
and
peter
tramped
for
miles
through
the
woods
and
over
the
hills
bringing
home
trillium
and
pungent
wild
currant
blossoms
and
filling
the
house
with
blooms
cherry
wedding
once
satisfactorily
over
was
a
cause
of
great
satisfaction
to
her
sister
and
cousin
they
had
stepped
back
duly
to
give
her
the
centre
of
the
stage
they
had
admired
and
congratulated
had
helped
her
in
all
hearty
generosity
they
had
listened
to
her
praises
of
martin
and
his
of
her
and
had
given
her
more
than
her
share
of
the
household
treasures
of
silver
spoons
and
yellowed
old
lace
and
now
that
she
was
gone
they
enjoyed
their
own
lives
again
and
cast
over
hers
the
glamour
that
novelty
and
distance
never
fail
to
give
cherry
married
and
keeping
house
and
managing
affairs
was
an
object
of
romantic
interest
the
girls
surmised
that
cherry
must
be
making
friends
that
everyone
must
admire
her
that
martin
would
be
rich
some
day
without
doubt
when
her
letters
came
there
was
always
animated
chatter
about
the
fire
cherry
wrote
regularly
now
and
then
assuring
them
that
she
was
the
same
old
cherry
she
described
her
tiny
house
right
at
the
mine
looking
down
at
the
rough
scaffoldings
that
covered
the
mouth
of
the
tunnels
and
the
long
sheds
of
the
plant
and
the
bare
big
building
that
was
the
men
martin
associates
brought
her
trout
and
ducks
she
wrote
she
and
martin
had
driven
three
hundred
miles
in
the
superintendent
car
she
was
preparing
for
a
card
party
think
of
little
old
cherry
going
off
on
trips
with
three
men
alix
would
say
proudly
think
of
cherry
giving
a
card
party
anne
perhaps
would
make
no
comment
but
she
often
felt
a
pang
of
envy
cherry
seemed
to
have
everything
alix
was
working
hard
with
her
music
this
winter
aided
and
abetted
by
peter
who
was
tireless
in
bringing
her
songs
and
taking
her
to
concerts
suddenly
without
warning
there
was
a
newcomer
in
the
circle
a
little
man
known
as
justin
little
he
had
been
introduced
at
some
party
to
anne
and
alix
he
called
he
was
presently
taking
anne
to
a
lecture
anne
now
began
to
laugh
at
him
and
say
that
he
was
too
ridiculous
but
she
did
not
allow
any
one
else
to
say
so
on
the
contrary
she
told
alix
at
various
times
that
his
mother
had
been
one
of
the
old
maryland
percies
and
his
was
mentioned
in
a
book
by
sir
walter
scott
and
that
one
had
to
respect
the
man
even
if
one
did
choose
to
marry
him
marry
him
alix
had
echoed
in
simple
amazement
marry
him
what
was
all
this
sudden
change
in
the
household
when
a
man
could
no
sooner
appear
than
some
girl
began
to
talk
of
marriage
alix
had
always
rather
fancied
the
idea
that
all
girls
had
an
opportunity
of
capriciously
choosing
from
a
dozen
eligible
swains
but
cherry
had
quickly
anchored
herself
to
the
first
strange
man
that
appeared
and
here
was
anne
dimpling
and
looking
demure
over
a
small
neat
youth
just
out
of
law
school
certainly
the
little
person
of
justin
little
was
a
strange
harbour
for
all
anne
vague
dreams
of
a
conquering
hero
stupefied
alix
watched
the
affair
progress
i
do
imagine
it
serious
her
father
said
on
an
april
walk
peter
tramping
beside
them
was
interested
but
silent
my
dear
father
the
girl
protested
have
you
listened
to
them
they
been
contending
for
weeks
that
they
were
just
remarkably
good
friends
that
why
she
calls
him
frenny
ah
i
see
the
doctor
said
mildly
as
peter
wild
laugh
burst
forth
but
now
alix
pursued
she
told
him
that
as
she
can
not
be
what
he
wishes
they
had
better
not
meet
poor
anne
the
old
doctor
commented
poor
nothing
she
having
the
time
of
her
life
her
cousin
said
unfeelingly
she
told
me
that
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
checked
one
of
the
most
brilliant
careers
at
the
bar
i
had
no
idea
of
all
this
the
doctor
confessed
amazed
i
seen
the
young
man
noticed
him
about
well
well
well
anne
too
you
and
me
next
little
sweetums
suggested
peter
dropping
down
beside
the
doctor
who
had
seated
himself
panting
upon
a
log
alix
the
dog
silky
head
under
her
hand
was
resting
against
the
prop
formed
by
a
great
tree
trunk
behind
her
shoulders
and
looking
down
at
the
two
men
she
grinned
nothingstirring
she
answered
blandly
the
old
man
looked
from
peter
smiling
indifferent
face
to
his
daughter
unembarrassed
smile
shook
his
head
in
puzzled
fashion
and
returned
to
his
pocket
the
big
handkerchief
with
which
he
had
been
wiping
his
forehead
there
ye
are
he
said
shrugging
cherry
goes
gaily
off
with
a
man
she
only
known
for
a
few
weeks
anne
dresses
up
this
new
fellow
with
goodness
knows
what
qualities
and
you
and
alix
here
neighbours
all
your
lives
laugh
as
if
marriage
was
all
a
joke
our
marriage
would
be
darling
alix
assured
him
but
dad
if
you
would
like
me
to
marry
peter
by
george
i
will
she
added
dutifully
peter
consider
yourself
betrothed
bucky
she
said
to
the
dog
dat
oo
new
daddy
neither
man
paid
her
the
slightest
attention
peter
scraped
a
lump
of
dried
mud
from
the
calf
of
his
high
boots
and
the
doctor
musingly
looked
back
along
the
rough
trail
they
had
climbed
i
have
felt
safer
i
feel
very
safe
to
have
one
of
my
girls
in
your
care
peter
the
older
man
said
at
last
thoughtfully
i
hate
to
see
them
scatter
well
he
sighed
smiled
and
got
to
his
feet
that
not
in
our
hands
he
said
cheerfully
alix
without
moving
sent
her
glance
from
his
face
to
peter
and
their
eyes
met
only
a
few
words
spoken
half
in
earnest
on
a
spring
morning
tramp
and
yet
they
had
their
place
in
her
memory
and
peter
and
were
to
return
to
them
after
a
time
and
influence
them
more
seriously
than
either
the
man
or
the
grinning
girl
or
the
old
man
himself
ever
dreamed
the
glance
lasted
only
a
second
then
alix
who
had
been
carefully
removing
burrs
from
the
soft
tangle
of
the
dog
tasselled
ears
took
the
trail
again
with
great
boyish
springs
of
her
bloomered
legs
father
said
she
am
i
to
understand
that
you
disapprove
of
my
choice
i
hope
her
father
answered
seriously
that
when
you
do
marry
you
will
get
a
man
half
as
good
as
peter
thank
you
peter
said
gravely
more
as
a
rebuke
to
the
incorrigible
alix
than
because
he
was
giving
the
conversation
much
attention
alix
had
time
for
no
comment
for
at
this
moment
she
placed
her
foot
upon
an
unsubstantial
root
and
slid
down
upon
the
two
men
with
such
an
unpremeditated
rush
of
heavy
boots
wet
loam
loosened
rocks
and
cascading
earth
that
the
footing
of
them
all
was
threatened
and
it
was
only
after
much
shouting
staggering
balancing
and
clutching
that
they
resumed
their
climb
peter
was
then
nursing
a
wrist
that
had
been
wrenched
in
the
confusion
looking
away
from
it
only
to
give
the
loudly
singing
alix
an
occasional
resentful
glance
you
could
omit
some
of
those
cries
he
presently
observed
i
thought
you
liked
lotos
flower
alix
called
back
i
just
proved
that
i
do
peter
said
neatly
and
the
doctor
and
alix
herself
laughed
joyously
in
june
came
the
blissful
hour
in
which
anne
all
blushes
and
smiles
could
come
to
her
uncle
with
a
dutiful
message
from
the
respectfully
adoring
justin
their
friendship
said
anne
had
ripened
into
something
deeper
justin
wants
to
have
a
frank
talk
with
you
uncle
anne
said
and
of
course
i
not
to
go
until
you
are
sure
you
can
spare
me
and
unless
you
feel
that
you
can
trust
him
utterly
and
remember
that
you
are
losing
a
daughter
but
gaining
a
son
oh
help
alix
added
anne
gave
her
a
reproachful
glance
but
found
it
impossible
to
be
angry
with
her
she
was
too
genuinely
delighted
with
her
cousin
happiness
and
too
helpful
with
all
the
new
plans
engagement
cups
were
ranged
on
the
table
where
cherry
had
stood
and
where
cherry
had
talked
of
a
rajah
silk
anne
discussed
the
merits
of
a
smart
but
handsome
blue
tailormade
the
wedding
was
to
be
in
september
not
quite
a
year
after
wedding
alix
wrote
her
sister
pages
about
it
always
ending
with
the
emphatic
declaration
that
cherry
must
come
down
for
the
wedding
cherry
read
of
it
with
a
strange
pang
somehow
it
robbed
her
own
marriage
of
flavour
and
charm
to
have
anne
so
quickly
following
in
her
footsteps
she
was
homesick
she
dreamed
continually
of
the
cool
high
valley
the
scented
aisles
of
the
deep
forest
the
mountain
rearing
its
rough
summit
to
the
pale
blue
of
summer
skies
june
passed
july
passed
it
was
hot
at
the
emmy
younger
august
came
in
on
a
furnace
breath
cherry
felt
headachy
languid
and
half
sick
all
the
time
she
hated
housekeeping
in
this
weather
hated
the
smells
of
dry
tin
sink
and
wooden
floor
of
milk
bottles
and
lard
tins
martin
had
said
that
he
could
not
possibly
get
away
even
for
the
week
of
anne
wedding
but
cherry
began
to
wonder
if
he
would
let
her
go
alone
if
he
does
i
shall
be
sick
she
fretted
to
herself
in
a
certain
burning
noontime
toward
the
middle
of
august
blazing
heat
had
been
pouring
over
the
mine
since
six
there
seemed
to
have
been
no
night
martin
who
had
been
playing
poker
the
night
before
was
sleeping
late
this
morning
he
was
proud
of
the
little
wife
who
so
generously
spared
him
for
an
occasional
game
and
always
allowed
him
to
sleep
far
into
the
following
morning
other
wives
at
the
mine
were
not
so
amiable
where
poker
was
concerned
but
martin
coming
home
at
three
dazed
with
close
air
and
cigar
smoke
had
awakened
his
wife
to
tell
her
that
he
would
be
dead
in
the
morning
and
cherry
had
accordingly
crept
about
her
own
dressing
noiselessly
had
darkened
the
bedroom
and
eaten
her
own
breakfast
without
the
clatter
of
a
dish
putting
the
coffee
aside
to
be
reheated
for
him
when
he
awakened
now
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
panting
in
the
noon
heat
and
looking
down
upon
a
dazzle
of
dust
and
ugliness
and
smothering
hotness
she
was
thinking
as
it
chanced
of
the
big
forest
at
home
and
of
a
certain
day
just
one
of
their
happy
days
only
a
year
ago
when
she
had
lain
for
a
dreamy
hour
on
the
soft
forest
floor
staring
up
idly
through
the
laced
fanlike
branches
and
she
thought
of
her
father
with
his
mild
voice
and
ready
smile
and
some
emotion
almost
like
fear
came
over
her
for
the
first
time
she
asked
herself
in
honest
bewilderment
why
she
had
married
the
heat
deepened
and
strengthened
and
increased
as
the
burning
day
wore
on
martin
waked
up
hot
and
headachy
and
having
further
distressed
himself
with
strong
coffee
and
eggs
departed
into
the
dusty
motionless
furnace
of
the
far
brown
hills
shimmered
and
swam
the
emmy
younger
looked
its
barest
its
ugliest
its
least
attractive
self
cherry
moved
slowly
about
the
kitchen
her
head
ached
it
was
a
day
of
sickening
odours
the
ice
man
had
failed
them
again
the
soup
had
soured
and
after
she
had
thrown
it
away
cherry
felt
as
if
the
grease
and
the
smell
of
it
still
clung
to
her
fingers
there
was
a
shadow
in
the
doorway
she
looked
up
surprised
for
a
minute
the
tall
figure
in
striped
linen
and
the
smiling
face
under
the
flowery
hat
seemed
those
of
a
stranger
then
cherry
cried
out
and
laughed
and
in
another
instant
was
crying
in
alix
arms
alix
cried
too
but
it
was
with
a
great
rush
of
pity
and
tenderness
for
cherry
alix
had
not
young
love
and
novelty
to
soften
the
outlines
of
the
emmy
younger
and
she
felt
as
she
frankly
wrote
later
to
her
father
at
last
convinced
that
there
is
a
hell
the
heat
and
bareness
and
ugliness
of
the
mine
might
have
been
overlooked
but
this
poor
little
house
of
cherry
this
wood
stove
draining
white
ashes
this
tin
sink
with
its
pump
and
the
bathroom
with
neither
faucets
nor
drain
almost
bewildered
alix
with
their
discomfort
even
more
bewildering
was
the
change
in
cherry
there
was
a
certain
hardening
that
impressed
alix
at
once
there
was
a
weary
sort
of
patience
a
disillusioned
concession
to
the
drabness
of
married
life
alix
after
meeting
some
of
the
other
wives
at
the
mine
there
were
but
five
or
six
saw
that
cherry
had
been
affected
by
them
there
was
general
sighing
over
the
housework
a
mild
conviction
that
men
were
all
selfish
and
unreasonable
and
i
must
say
alix
first
letter
to
her
father
admitted
that
the
men
here
are
all
dogs
except
the
ones
that
are
under
dogs
but
she
allowed
the
younger
sister
to
see
nothing
of
this
indeed
cherry
so
brightened
under
the
stimulus
of
alix
companionship
that
martin
told
her
that
she
was
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
had
been
for
months
joyously
she
divided
her
responsibilities
with
alix
explaining
the
difficulties
of
marketing
and
housekeeping
and
joyously
alix
assumed
them
her
vitality
infected
the
whole
household
and
indeed
the
mine
as
well
she
flirted
cooked
entertained
talked
incessantly
she
bullied
martin
and
laughed
at
him
and
it
did
him
good
perhaps
thought
alix
rather
appalled
at
cherry
attitude
cherry
had
been
too
young
for
wifehood
sometimes
she
spoiled
and
humoured
martin
and
sometimes
quarrelled
with
him
childishly
scolding
and
fretting
for
her
own
way
and
angry
with
conditions
over
which
neither
he
nor
she
had
any
control
alix
was
surprised
to
see
the
old
pout
and
hear
the
old
phrase
of
cherry
indulged
girlhood
i
do
think
this
is
any
fun
anne
is
one
half
as
clever
or
as
pretty
as
cherry
but
she
make
a
better
wife
was
alix
conclusion
she
gave
them
spirited
accounts
of
anne
affair
he
a
nice
little
academic
fellow
she
said
of
justin
little
if
he
had
a
flatiron
in
each
hand
he
probably
weigh
close
to
a
hundred
pounds
he
a
well
a
sort
of
youth
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
always
want
to
take
a
crash
towel
and
dry
him
off
fancy
anne
with
a
shrimp
like
that
cherry
said
with
a
proud
look
at
her
own
man
fine
height
anne
was
delicious
alix
further
revealed
they
used
to
take
dignified
walks
on
sundays
i
used
to
tease
her
and
she
get
so
mad
she
ask
dad
to
ask
me
to
be
more
refined
she
said
that
little
was
a
most
unusual
man
and
it
was
belittling
to
his
dignity
to
have
me
suppose
that
a
man
and
a
woman
could
have
an
intellectual
friendship
this
in
may
my
dear
and
after
the
thing
was
settled
and
anne
had
cried
and
written
notes
and
justin
had
gone
to
dad
and
asked
where
he
could
buy
a
revolver
oh
alexandra
strickland
you
making
up
cherry
went
back
naturally
to
the
old
nursery
phrase
honestly
cross
my
heart
alix
assured
her
that
the
way
they
managed
it
they
solemnly
discussed
it
and
worked
it
out
on
paper
and
justin
mother
called
on
anne
she
an
awful
old
girl
too
she
looks
like
a
totem
pole
and
anne
called
on
his
aunts
and
then
he
asked
dad
anne
male
relative
he
said
and
it
was
all
settled
and
then
then
anne
became
the
mushiest
thing
i
ever
saw
and
not
only
mushy
cherry
but
proudly
and
openly
mushy
she
catch
justin
hand
up
at
the
table
and
say
echoed
cherry
who
had
laughed
until
actual
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
that
short
for
do
you
see
because
of
this
platonic
intellectual
friendship
that
started
everything
you
know
she
catch
up
his
hand
and
say
show
uncle
what
an
aristocratic
hand
you
got
my
dear
she
keep
me
awake
nights
repeating
things
said
to
her
so
wonderful
alix
he
the
simplest
and
at
the
same
time
the
cleverest
man
i
ever
knew
he
sounds
awful
to
me
cherry
said
he
not
really
only
it
seems
that
he
belongs
to
the
oldest
family
in
america
or
something
and
is
the
only
descendent
money
cherry
asked
interestedly
no
i
do
think
money
exactly
at
least
i
know
he
is
getting
a
hundred
a
month
in
his
uncle
law
office
and
dad
thinks
they
ought
to
wait
until
they
have
a
little
more
she
have
something
you
know
alix
added
after
a
moment
thought
your
cousin
martin
asked
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
well
her
father
went
into
the
thing
with
dad
alix
elucidated
and
evidently
she
and
justin
have
had
deep
soulful
thoughts
about
it
anyway
the
other
day
she
said
you
know
her
way
cherry
me
uncle
frankly
and
honestly
may
justin
and
i
draw
out
my
share
for
that
little
home
that
is
going
to
mean
so
much
to
us
i
can
hear
her
giggled
cherry
dad
immediately
said
that
she
could
of
course
alix
went
on
going
to
look
the
whole
thing
up
he
was
adorable
about
it
he
said
will
do
more
than
build
you
a
little
home
my
dear
we
get
a
slice
of
that
some
time
cherry
said
thoughtfully
glancing
at
her
husband
i
do
mean
when
dad
dies
either
she
added
in
quick
affection
i
mean
that
he
might
build
us
a
little
home
some
day
in
mill
valley
gee
how
he
love
it
alix
said
enthusiastically
i
married
cherry
for
her
money
martin
confessed
as
a
matter
of
fact
cherry
contradicted
him
vivaciously
animated
even
by
the
thought
of
a
change
and
a
home
we
have
never
even
spoken
of
it
before
have
we
mart
i
never
heard
of
it
before
he
admitted
smiling
as
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
if
i
leave
the
younger
in
october
and
go
into
the
red
creek
proposition
i
shall
be
making
a
good
deal
myself
but
it
pleasant
to
know
that
cherry
will
come
in
for
a
some
day
mart
does
care
a
scrap
for
money
cherry
said
to
her
sister
in
the
old
loyal
way
since
alix
arrival
she
had
somehow
liked
martin
better
perhaps
alix
brought
to
her
sister
with
a
whiff
of
the
old
atmosphere
the
old
content
the
old
pride
and
the
old
presently
the
visitor
boldly
suggested
that
they
should
both
go
home
together
for
the
wedding
and
martin
to
cherry
amazement
agreed
but
mart
how
you
get
along
his
wife
asked
anxiously
she
had
fumed
and
fussed
and
puttered
and
toiled
over
the
care
of
these
four
rooms
for
so
long
that
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
her
place
might
be
vacated
even
for
a
day
oh
i
get
along
fine
he
answered
indifferently
cherry
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
delight
abandoned
the
whole
problem
milk
bottles
fire
wood
groceries
dust
and
laundry
slipped
from
her
mind
as
if
they
had
never
been
on
the
last
day
of
august
in
the
silk
and
the
expensive
hat
again
yet
looking
alix
thought
strangely
unlike
the
bride
that
had
been
cherry
she
and
her
sister
happily
departed
for
cooler
regions
martin
took
them
to
the
train
kissed
his
gaily
and
then
his
wife
affectionately
be
a
good
little
girl
babe
he
said
and
write
me
oh
i
will
i
will
cherry
looked
after
him
smilingly
from
the
car
window
he
really
is
an
old
dear
she
told
alix
chapter
vi
but
when
at
the
end
of
the
long
day
they
reached
the
valley
and
when
her
father
came
innocently
into
the
garden
and
stood
staring
vaguely
at
her
for
a
moment
for
her
visit
and
the
day
of
alix
return
had
been
kept
a
secret
her
first
act
was
to
burst
into
tears
she
clung
to
the
fatherly
shoulder
as
if
she
were
a
bird
safely
home
again
and
although
she
immediately
laughed
at
herself
and
told
the
sympathetically
watching
peter
and
alix
that
she
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
her
it
was
only
to
interrupt
the
words
with
fresh
tears
tears
of
joy
she
told
them
laughing
at
the
moisture
in
her
eyes
hanging
on
his
arm
she
went
back
into
the
old
sitting
room
again
under
the
banksia
rose
went
up
the
brown
stairway
to
the
old
clean
bedroom
her
hat
and
wraps
went
into
the
closet
she
danced
and
exclaimed
and
exulted
over
every
familiar
detail
she
and
alix
ran
downstairs
before
supper
and
into
the
garden
and
cherry
drew
deep
refreshing
breaths
of
the
cool
air
and
laughed
over
every
bush
and
flower
peter
came
out
to
join
them
her
father
came
down
and
she
kissed
him
again
she
could
not
be
close
enough
to
him
she
had
a
special
joyous
word
for
hong
she
laughed
and
teased
and
questioned
anne
when
anne
and
justin
came
back
from
an
afternoon
concert
in
the
city
with
an
interest
and
enthusiasm
most
gratifying
to
both
after
dinner
she
had
her
old
place
on
the
arm
of
her
father
porch
chair
alix
with
buck
smooth
head
in
her
lap
sat
on
the
porch
step
beside
peter
and
the
lovers
murmured
from
the
darkness
of
the
hammock
under
the
shadow
of
the
rose
vine
it
was
happy
talk
in
the
sweet
evening
coolness
everybody
seemed
harmonious
and
in
sympathy
alix
asked
peter
advice
regarding
her
white
minorcas
and
respectfully
promised
to
act
upon
it
and
cherry
showed
him
a
new
side
an
affectionate
little
sisterly
deference
and
confidence
quite
different
from
her
old
childish
sulkiness
and
pretty
caprice
bedtime
said
her
father
presently
and
she
laughed
in
sheer
pleasure
daddy
that
sounds
so
nice
again
but
you
do
look
fagged
and
pale
little
girl
he
told
her
you
to
stay
in
bed
in
the
morning
oh
i
be
down
she
assured
him
but
she
did
not
come
down
in
the
morning
none
the
less
she
was
tired
in
soul
and
body
and
glad
to
let
them
spoil
her
again
glad
to
rest
and
sleep
in
the
heavenly
peace
and
quiet
of
the
old
home
midsummer
heat
was
upon
the
little
valley
but
here
under
the
redwoods
there
was
always
coolness
delicious
odours
of
warm
sap
and
loamy
sweetness
drifted
into
cherry
darkened
room
the
morning
was
fresh
and
foggy
and
the
night
before
she
had
smiled
drowsily
to
stir
from
first
sleep
and
find
her
father
bending
over
her
drawing
up
an
extra
blanket
in
the
old
way
all
night
long
she
slept
deeply
and
sweetly
as
she
had
slept
through
all
the
nights
of
childhood
it
was
ten
when
alix
came
smiling
in
with
a
breakfast
tray
presently
she
carried
it
away
and
cherry
with
a
deep
sigh
from
the
fullness
of
her
content
turned
on
her
side
and
drowsed
again
waking
after
a
while
she
locked
her
hands
under
her
head
and
lay
listening
happily
to
the
old
and
familiar
sounds
of
home
she
heard
hong
bargaining
in
his
own
minor
chatter
with
a
fruit
vendor
and
alix
and
her
father
chuckling
over
some
small
confidence
in
the
porch
she
heard
the
subdued
clink
of
dishes
the
squawk
of
a
surprised
chicken
and
the
girls
murmuring
voices
it
was
saturday
cherry
remembered
when
peter
voice
suddenly
sounded
above
the
others
and
was
hastily
hushed
for
her
sake
peter
was
always
there
at
three
on
saturdays
there
was
another
voice
too
pleasant
and
crisp
and
even
a
trifle
fastidious
that
must
be
justin
late
in
the
afternoon
rested
fresh
and
her
old
sweet
self
in
the
white
ruffles
she
came
down
to
join
them
they
had
settled
themselves
under
the
redwoods
anne
and
justin
peter
and
alix
and
buck
the
dog
all
jumped
up
to
greet
her
cherry
very
quietly
subsided
into
a
wicker
chair
listened
rather
than
talked
moved
her
lovely
eyes
affectionately
from
one
to
another
peter
hardly
moved
his
eyes
from
her
although
he
did
not
often
address
her
directly
justin
was
quite
obviously
overcome
by
the
unexpected
beauty
of
anne
cousin
anne
herself
with
an
undefined
pang
admitted
in
her
soul
that
cherry
was
prettier
than
ever
and
even
alix
was
affected
with
the
lovely
background
of
the
forest
the
shade
of
her
thin
wide
hat
lightly
shadowing
her
face
with
the
dew
of
her
long
sleep
and
recent
bath
enhancing
the
childish
purity
of
her
skin
and
with
her
blue
eyes
full
of
content
cherry
was
a
picture
of
exquisite
youth
and
grace
and
charm
it
was
not
the
less
winning
because
she
seemed
genuinely
unconscious
of
it
perhaps
before
the
girls
and
anne
precise
little
fledgling
lawyer
no
thought
of
conquest
had
entered
her
head
the
dog
had
gone
to
her
knee
and
laid
his
bronze
mane
against
the
white
ruffles
and
while
she
listened
and
smiled
she
idly
fondled
and
petted
him
with
her
childish
ringed
hand
and
the
next
experience
is
to
be
at
red
creek
justin
asked
delighted
with
this
addition
to
the
family
circle
and
beaming
about
upon
everyone
lloyd
is
there
now
cherry
smiled
do
you
know
red
creek
have
to
call
you
justin
since
you
going
to
be
my
cousin
so
soon
she
interrupted
herself
to
say
shyly
no
i
er
i
er
do
justin
stammered
anne
said
vivaciously
of
course
you
to
call
him
justin
and
he
to
call
you
cherry
too
those
are
my
orders
frenny
and
do
you
dare
disobey
but
did
you
get
onto
the
artful
and
engaging
smile
justin
gave
cherry
alix
giggled
later
to
peter
she
and
peter
were
in
the
pantry
deep
in
the
manufacture
of
a
certain
sort
of
canape
why
he
was
all
in
a
heap
over
her
continued
alix
elegantly
as
she
sampled
a
small
piece
of
smeared
toast
with
a
severe
and
wrinkled
brow
try
a
little
mustard
in
it
she
suggested
adding
confidentially
you
know
cherry
is
really
too
pretty
for
any
use
the
rest
of
us
can
diet
for
complexion
or
diet
for
figures
and
this
hat
will
be
becoming
or
that
dress
will
always
look
well
but
cherry
why
she
just
knocks
us
all
what
the
use
of
struggling
and
brushing
your
hair
and
worrying
about
your
clothes
when
a
girl
like
cherry
will
come
along
and
sit
down
and
have
everybody
staring
she
is
of
course
quite
extraordinary
peter
conceded
as
he
punched
two
small
holes
in
the
top
of
a
tin
of
olive
oil
the
oil
welled
up
through
the
holes
and
he
wiped
his
fingers
on
a
corner
of
alix
apron
it
just
the
difference
alix
said
between
being
nice
looking
which
half
the
women
in
the
word
are
and
being
a
beauty
i
remember
that
when
cherry
was
only
about
ten
i
used
to
look
at
her
and
think
that
there
was
something
rather
well
rather
arresting
about
her
face
it
was
such
an
aristocratic
little
face
i
remember
her
in
those
old
bluejacket
blouses
yes
i
do
too
peter
said
quickly
straightening
up
from
restoring
the
vinegar
demijohn
to
an
obscure
position
in
a
lower
cupboard
well
these
have
to
go
in
the
oven
now
i
take
them
out
are
you
going
to
change
for
dinner
it
after
six
now
since
you
ask
me
i
see
what
frock
deshabille
has
laid
out
alix
yawned
disappearing
in
the
direction
of
the
sitting
room
where
he
found
her
a
few
minutes
later
absorbed
in
a
book
the
evening
was
cooler
with
sudden
wind
and
a
promise
of
storm
they
grouped
themselves
about
a
fire
in
the
old
way
anne
and
justin
sitting
close
together
on
the
settle
as
martin
and
cherry
had
done
a
year
ago
cherry
sat
next
her
father
with
her
hand
linked
in
his
neither
hand
moved
for
a
long
long
time
alix
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
lean
cheeks
painted
by
the
fire
played
with
the
dog
and
rallied
peter
about
some
love
affair
the
details
of
which
made
him
laugh
vexedly
in
spite
of
himself
cherry
watched
them
a
little
puzzled
at
the
familiarity
of
peter
beside
this
fire
had
he
been
so
entirely
one
of
the
family
a
year
ago
she
could
almost
envy
him
feeling
herself
removed
by
so
long
and
strange
a
twelvemonth
be
that
as
it
may
my
dear
said
alix
the
fact
remains
that
you
taught
this
fenton
woman
to
drive
your
car
did
you
and
you
told
her
that
she
was
the
best
woman
driver
you
ever
knew
a
better
driver
even
than
miss
strickland
did
you
i
did
not
peter
said
unmovedly
smoking
and
watching
the
fire
why
peter
you
did
she
said
you
did
well
then
she
said
what
is
not
true
she
distinctly
told
me
alix
remarked
that
dear
joyce
had
said
that
she
was
the
best
woman
driver
he
ever
saw
well
i
may
have
said
something
like
that
peter
growled
flushing
alix
laughed
exultingly
i
tell
you
i
loathe
her
he
added
daddy
we
have
a
lovely
home
cherry
said
softly
her
eyes
moving
from
the
shabby
books
and
the
shabby
rugs
to
alix
piano
shining
in
the
gloom
of
the
far
corner
it
was
all
homelike
and
pleasant
and
somehow
the
atmosphere
was
newly
inspiring
to
her
she
had
felt
that
the
talk
at
dinner
the
old
eager
controversy
about
books
and
singers
and
politics
and
science
was
well
not
brilliant
perhaps
but
worth
while
she
was
beginning
to
think
peter
extremely
clever
and
only
alix
quick
tongue
a
match
for
him
and
to
feel
that
her
father
knew
every
book
and
had
seen
every
worthwhile
play
in
the
world
martin
whose
deep
dissatisfaction
with
conditions
at
the
emmy
younger
mine
cherry
well
knew
had
entered
into
a
correspondence
some
months
before
relative
to
a
position
at
another
mine
that
seemed
better
to
him
and
instead
of
coming
down
for
a
day
or
two
at
the
time
of
wedding
as
cherry
had
hoped
he
might
wrote
her
that
the
authorities
at
the
red
creek
plant
had
jumped
at
him
and
that
he
was
closing
up
all
his
affairs
at
the
emmy
younger
and
had
arranged
to
ship
all
their
household
effects
direct
to
the
new
home
he
knew
nothing
of
red
creek
except
that
it
was
a
small
inland
town
in
the
san
joachim
region
but
cherry
delight
at
the
thought
of
any
alternative
for
the
emmy
younger
was
a
revelation
to
alix
martin
told
his
wife
generously
that
he
hoped
she
would
stay
with
her
father
until
the
move
was
accomplished
and
cherry
with
a
clear
conscience
established
herself
in
her
old
room
she
wrote
constantly
to
her
husband
and
often
spoke
appreciatively
of
mart
kindness
anne
marriage
took
place
in
it
was
a
much
more
formal
and
elaborate
affair
than
cherry
had
been
because
as
anne
explained
frenny
people
have
been
so
generous
about
giving
him
up
you
know
after
all
he
the
last
of
the
littles
all
the
others
are
folsoms
and
randalls
and
i
want
them
to
realize
that
he
is
marrying
a
gentlewoman
the
older
littles
and
all
the
folsoms
and
randalls
came
to
the
wedding
thrifty
people
who
were
for
the
most
part
as
alix
summarized
it
buying
little
homes
on
the
installment
plan
in
desirable
residential
districts
of
oakland
and
berkeley
there
were
school
teachers
in
dark
plaid
silk
waists
and
young
matrons
in
carefully
planned
colour
schemes
of
brown
and
gray
and
they
all
told
alix
and
cherry
about
the
family
the
members
who
were
daughters
of
the
revolution
and
the
members
who
belonged
to
the
society
of
the
daughters
of
officers
of
the
civil
war
cherry
and
alix
went
upstairs
after
the
ceremony
as
alix
and
anne
had
done
a
year
ago
but
there
was
deep
relief
and
amusement
in
their
mood
and
it
was
with
real
pleasure
in
the
closer
intimacy
that
the
little
group
gathered
about
the
fire
that
night
after
that
life
went
on
serenely
and
it
was
only
occasionally
that
the
girls
were
reminded
that
cherry
was
a
married
woman
with
a
husband
expecting
her
shortly
to
return
to
him
when
she
and
alix
took
part
in
the
village
fairs
and
bazaars
alix
was
still
a
little
thrilled
to
see
their
names
in
print
miss
strickland
and
her
sister
lloyd
who
is
visiting
her
but
to
cherry
all
the
romance
seemed
to
have
vanished
from
her
new
estate
november
passed
and
christmas
came
and
there
was
some
talk
of
martin
joining
them
for
christmas
but
he
did
not
come
he
was
extremely
busy
at
the
new
mine
and
comfortable
in
a
village
it
was
in
early
march
that
alix
spoke
to
her
father
about
it
spoke
in
her
casual
and
vague
fashion
but
gave
him
food
for
serious
thought
nevertheless
dad
said
alix
suddenly
at
the
lunch
table
one
day
when
cherry
happened
to
be
shopping
in
the
city
were
you
and
mother
ever
separated
when
you
were
married
no
the
doctor
remembering
shook
his
head
your
mother
never
was
happy
away
from
her
home
not
even
to
visit
her
own
family
persisted
alix
not
ever
he
answered
we
always
planned
a
long
visit
in
the
east
but
she
never
would
go
without
me
she
went
to
your
uncle
vincent
house
in
palo
alto
once
but
she
came
home
the
next
day
did
feel
comfortable
away
from
home
how
long
do
you
suppose
martin
will
let
us
have
cherry
alix
asked
her
father
looked
quickly
at
her
and
a
troubled
expression
crossed
his
face
the
circumstances
seem
to
make
it
wise
to
keep
her
here
until
he
is
sure
that
this
new
position
is
the
right
one
he
said
if
i
know
anything
about
martin
alix
said
no
position
is
ever
going
to
be
the
right
one
for
him
i
mean
she
added
as
her
father
gave
her
an
alarmed
look
i
simply
mean
that
he
is
that
sort
of
man
and
it
seems
to
me
odd
the
way
he
and
cherry
take
their
marriage
now
when
she
got
here
five
months
six
months
ago
alix
went
on
as
her
father
watched
her
in
close
and
distressed
attention
cherry
was
always
talking
about
going
back
to
mart
every
time
he
sent
her
money
she
would
say
that
she
ought
to
keep
it
for
a
sudden
summons
but
she
does
do
that
now
you
been
giving
her
her
own
allowance
right
along
and
she
has
settled
down
just
as
she
was
a
day
or
two
ago
martin
sent
her
twenty
dollars
and
she
has
gone
into
town
to
spend
it
she
hesitated
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
think
she
ought
to
go
back
her
father
asked
no
i
do
think
so
alix
answered
eagerly
i
do
think
anything
about
it
but
but
is
that
marriage
is
that
really
for
better
or
for
worse
i
mean
she
interrupted
herself
hastily
as
time
goes
on
it
will
get
harder
and
harder
for
her
there
will
seem
to
be
less
and
less
reason
for
going
brown
was
talking
to
me
about
it
yesterday
and
she
asked
in
that
catty
smiling
way
she
has
trust
the
women
to
gossip
the
doctor
said
impatiently
well
nobody
minds
their
gossip
his
daughter
assured
him
and
for
my
part
i
think
it
a
shame
that
a
girl
ca
come
back
home
as
simply
as
that
if
she
wants
to
she
added
boldly
do
talk
nonsense
her
father
said
mildly
you
think
he
added
reluctantly
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
her
eh
well
alix
began
she
does
seem
like
other
married
women
she
said
doubtfully
and
the
only
thing
is
will
she
ever
want
to
go
back
if
she
is
rather
rather
coerced
martin
is
odd
you
know
he
has
a
kind
of
stolid
stupid
pride
he
wrote
her
weeks
ago
and
asked
her
to
come
and
she
wrote
back
that
if
he
would
find
her
a
cottage
she
would
she
could
go
to
his
she
hated
boarding
martin
answered
that
he
would
some
day
and
she
said
to
me
now
he
cross
now
mind
you
alix
broke
off
vehemently
i
change
the
entire
institution
of
marriage
if
it
was
me
i
end
all
this
well
we
wo
go
into
that
her
father
interrupted
her
hastily
for
alix
had
aired
these
views
before
and
he
was
not
in
sympathy
with
them
and
i
guess
you
right
the
child
is
a
woman
now
with
a
responsibilities
he
added
and
her
place
is
with
her
husband
they
have
to
solve
life
together
to
learn
together
i
speak
to
cherry
alix
watching
him
walk
away
thought
that
she
had
never
seen
dad
look
old
before
she
saw
the
shadow
on
his
kind
face
all
the
rest
of
that
day
it
was
only
the
next
morning
when
he
opened
the
question
with
cherry
it
was
a
brilliant
morning
with
spring
already
in
the
air
cherry
on
the
porch
steps
was
reading
a
letter
from
martin
her
father
sat
down
beside
her
she
had
on
one
of
her
old
gowns
and
bathed
in
soft
sunlight
looked
eighteen
again
emerald
grass
was
already
filming
the
ground
about
the
house
from
under
the
deep
rich
brown
of
the
forest
flooring
spring
had
thrust
a
million
tiny
spears
of
green
the
redwoods
wore
plushy
plumes
of
blue
new
foliage
and
a
wild
lilac
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
drifted
like
pale
smoke
against
the
dark
woods
everywhere
life
was
soaking
and
bursting
after
heavy
rains
the
very
posts
of
the
garden
fence
were
sprouting
little
feathery
tips
the
air
was
sweet
and
pungent
and
damp
and
fresh
the
sky
high
and
blue
and
across
the
granite
face
of
tamalpais
a
last
scarf
of
mist
was
floating
well
what
has
martin
to
say
asked
the
doctor
oh
he
does
like
it
much
cherry
said
making
a
little
face
he
describes
the
village
as
perfectly
hopeless
he
moved
into
the
little
house
in
e
street
and
gotten
two
stoves
up
and
when
does
he
want
his
girl
her
father
pursued
he
does
say
cherry
answered
innocently
i
think
he
is
really
happier
to
have
me
here
where
he
knows
i
am
well
off
she
said
i
know
i
am
she
ended
after
a
moment
thought
her
father
was
conscious
of
a
pang
he
had
not
even
formed
the
thought
in
his
own
mind
that
cherry
was
unhappy
he
was
as
trusting
and
as
innocent
as
his
daughters
in
many
ways
he
shrank
from
the
unwelcome
facts
of
life
his
own
childhood
had
been
hard
and
disciplinary
and
at
cherry
age
he
had
been
concerned
only
with
realities
with
the
need
of
food
and
clothes
and
shelter
that
a
life
could
be
spoiled
simply
by
contact
with
an
unsympathetic
personality
was
incomprehensible
to
him
the
child
he
told
himself
had
a
good
husband
a
home
and
health
and
undeveloped
resources
within
herself
it
was
puzzling
and
painful
to
him
to
realize
that
there
was
needed
something
more
and
that
that
something
was
lacking
he
felt
a
sudden
anger
at
martin
why
martin
managing
this
affair
mart
does
mention
any
time
he
mused
thanks
to
you
cherry
said
dimpling
mischievously
he
wrote
quite
firmly
just
before
christmas
she
added
but
i
told
him
that
dad
had
been
such
an
angel
and
liked
so
much
to
have
me
here
and
smile
was
full
of
childish
triumph
my
dear
her
father
said
spurred
to
sudden
courage
by
a
realization
that
the
matter
might
easily
become
serious
you
must
abuse
his
generosity
suppose
you
write
that
you
join
him
this
is
march
suppose
you
say
the
first
of
april
cherry
flushed
and
looked
down
her
lips
trembled
there
was
a
moment
of
unhappy
silence
very
well
dad
she
said
in
a
low
voice
a
second
later
she
had
jumped
to
her
feet
and
vanished
in
the
house
her
father
roamed
the
woods
in
wretched
misgivings
coming
in
at
lunch
time
to
find
her
in
her
place
smiling
but
traces
of
tears
about
her
lovely
eyes
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
cherry
read
aloud
to
the
family
an
affectionate
letter
in
which
martin
said
that
everything
would
be
ready
for
her
whenever
she
came
now
chapter
vii
the
last
day
of
march
and
of
cherry
visit
broke
clear
and
blue
and
with
it
spring
seemed
to
have
come
on
a
rush
of
perfume
and
green
beauty
days
had
been
soft
and
warm
before
this
day
was
hot
and
flushed
with
colour
and
splendour
there
were
iris
in
the
dewy
grass
under
the
oaks
but
in
the
sunshine
every
trace
of
winter
damp
had
disappeared
larks
whirled
up
from
the
fields
and
the
and
syringa
bushes
were
mounds
of
creamy
bloom
alix
and
cherry
washed
each
other
hair
in
the
old
fashion
and
came
trailing
down
with
towels
and
combs
to
the
garden
the
doctor
joined
them
in
the
midst
of
their
tossing
and
spreading
and
sat
smoking
peacefully
on
the
porch
steps
oh
heavens
how
i
love
this
sort
of
weather
alix
exclaimed
flinging
her
brown
mane
backward
her
tall
figure
slender
in
a
faded
kimono
she
sat
down
crosswise
on
her
chair
locked
her
arms
about
its
back
dropped
her
face
on
them
and
yawned
luxuriously
dad
and
peter
she
went
on
suddenly
sitting
erect
will
get
all
this
nice
clean
hair
full
of
cigar
smoke
so
what
the
use
anyway
the
night
we
go
to
peter
cherry
stated
rather
than
asked
do
you
remember
she
glanced
at
her
father
who
was
reading
his
paper
do
you
remember
when
dad
always
used
to
scold
us
for
being
rude
to
peter
well
i
rather
go
to
peter
for
dinner
than
anywhere
else
i
ever
go
alix
remarked
dreamily
seriously
i
mean
it
she
repeated
as
cherry
looked
at
her
in
amused
surprise
in
the
first
place
i
love
his
bungalow
tiny
as
it
is
it
has
the
whole
of
a
little
canyon
to
itself
and
the
prettiest
view
in
the
valley
i
think
and
then
i
love
the
messy
sitting
room
with
all
the
books
and
music
and
i
love
the
way
peter
entertains
i
wish
she
added
simply
that
i
liked
peter
half
as
well
as
i
do
his
house
peter
a
dear
cherry
contended
oh
i
know
he
is
alix
said
quickly
peter
always
been
a
dear
of
course
but
i
mean
in
a
special
sense
finished
alix
with
an
entirely
unembarrassed
grin
cherry
through
a
glittering
cloud
of
hair
looked
at
her
steadily
suddenly
she
gave
an
odd
laugh
do
you
know
i
never
thought
of
peter
like
that
she
said
alix
nodded
with
a
cautious
look
at
her
father
who
was
out
of
hearing
no
nor
i
we
always
taken
him
rather
for
granted
she
admitted
only
i
been
rather
wishing
lately
that
peter
was
such
an
unflattering
sort
of
person
still
cherry
regarded
her
steadily
with
an
awakening
look
in
her
eyes
why
lately
she
asked
because
said
alix
briskly
and
unromantically
i
think
peter
would
like
me
to
well
to
stop
taking
him
for
granted
but
peter
lame
cherry
submitted
doubtfully
you
ca
call
a
shortness
left
from
a
broken
leg
lame
alix
protested
peter
is
brawny
but
he
never
been
and
he
not
a
child
he
and
i
imagine
he
awfully
lonely
and
then
i
imagine
it
would
please
dad
dad
has
always
been
ridiculously
fond
of
him
cherry
said
thoughtfully
peter
possibly
in
love
with
alix
she
had
never
even
suspected
it
peter
attitude
toward
them
all
had
been
more
paternal
than
anything
else
cherry
and
her
sister
could
not
remember
life
without
peter
but
he
had
always
been
dad
friend
rather
than
theirs
he
had
rebuked
them
he
had
patiently
asked
them
not
to
chatter
so
he
had
criticized
their
grammar
and
their
clothes
and
their
friends
peter
and
alix
well
there
was
something
rather
pleasant
in
the
thought
after
all
if
alix
did
mind
his
ugliness
and
thinness
cherry
thought
about
it
all
day
she
had
had
no
thought
of
money
a
year
or
two
ago
but
she
was
more
experienced
now
and
peter
was
rich
ordinarily
she
would
have
said
that
she
was
not
going
to
change
for
peter
dinner
but
this
afternoon
without
mentioning
the
fact
she
quietly
got
into
one
of
her
prettiest
dresses
a
dress
that
had
been
made
in
the
excitement
of
trousseau
days
peter
as
a
rather
autocratic
and
critical
neighbour
was
one
thing
as
a
possible
he
was
another
she
came
downstairs
to
find
her
father
waiting
and
they
walked
away
through
the
woods
together
alix
had
already
gone
up
to
peter
house
to
play
tennis
they
walked
slowly
through
the
lovely
aisles
of
the
trees
crossing
a
road
or
two
climbing
steadily
upward
under
great
redwoods
the
forest
was
thinning
with
oaks
and
madrone
trees
and
they
found
the
sunlight
again
high
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
before
a
turn
of
the
trail
brought
them
in
view
of
peter
bungalow
it
was
a
shabby
little
place
all
porch
and
slope
of
rough
brown
roof
set
in
a
wilderness
of
wild
flowers
and
overlooking
long
descending
slopes
of
hillside
that
stretched
far
away
to
the
very
bay
and
marshes
at
the
ocean
mouth
the
spring
sunshine
streamed
across
it
with
broad
shadows
the
mountains
rough
crest
stood
against
a
wide
expanse
of
sunset
sky
cherry
skirt
brushed
the
gold
dust
from
masses
and
masses
of
buttercups
the
tennis
was
over
but
just
over
peter
and
alix
were
sitting
still
panting
on
the
rail
of
the
wide
open
porch
and
shouted
as
the
others
came
up
you
missed
doubles
called
alix
the
grandest
we
ever
did
doubles
with
the
thompsons
and
three
sets
straight
to
us
and
again
they
gone
oh
heavens
i
never
had
such
tennis
oh
peter
when
you
stood
there
at
the
net
and
just
curved
your
hand
like
a
cup
alix
gave
an
enthusiastic
imitation
and
over
she
went
and
game
and
set
cherry
sinking
white
and
frilly
into
a
chair
smiled
indulgently
the
walk
had
given
her
a
colour
and
even
alix
was
struck
with
her
extraordinary
beauty
alix
had
wheeled
about
on
the
rail
to
face
the
porch
and
peter
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
was
hospitably
pushing
basket
chairs
about
now
he
gave
alix
a
critical
look
you
disgracefully
dirty
he
said
fraternally
i
know
it
she
answered
calmly
have
i
time
to
tub
all
the
time
in
the
world
he
answered
are
any
clothes
of
mine
here
further
demanded
alix
rising
lazily
yes
there
a
blouse
it
in
the
linen
closet
ask
kow
for
it
or
get
it
yourself
when
you
get
your
towels
you
left
it
the
day
you
changed
here
after
we
all
climbed
the
mountain
i
hope
you
people
are
going
to
get
enough
to
eat
peter
added
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
beside
cherry
he
been
cooking
it
since
breakfast
alix
remarked
departing
peter
laughed
guiltily
and
cherry
too
it
was
only
an
exaggeration
of
the
simple
truth
he
loved
to
cook
and
his
meals
were
famous
it
very
pleasant
to
me
to
have
alix
so
much
at
home
here
cherry
said
when
alix
was
gone
and
the
doctor
wandering
happily
about
the
garden
i
do
know
what
we
do
if
any
one
ever
usurped
our
places
here
she
had
said
it
deliberately
the
fascination
of
her
recent
discovery
was
too
strong
to
resist
the
man
flushed
suddenly
for
a
full
minute
he
did
not
speak
and
cherry
was
surprised
to
find
herself
a
little
thrilled
and
even
frightened
by
his
silence
what
put
that
into
your
head
he
asked
presently
smoking
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
valley
far
below
just
being
here
she
answered
and
as
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
he
met
her
smile
you
been
here
a
thousand
times
without
ever
paying
me
a
compliment
he
reminded
her
cherry
considered
this
her
brows
drawn
a
trifle
together
perhaps
she
offered
presently
it
because
there
are
so
many
changes
peter
my
marriage
anne
everything
different
it
just
came
to
me
that
it
is
nice
to
have
this
always
the
same
perhaps
alix
will
come
up
here
and
help
keep
it
so
some
day
the
man
said
deliberately
cherry
look
of
elaborate
surprise
and
pleasure
died
before
his
serious
glance
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
why
do
you
ask
her
she
said
in
a
low
thoughtful
tone
trembling
eager
to
preserve
his
mood
without
a
false
note
i
have
he
answered
simply
cherry
heart
jumped
with
a
sudden
unexpected
emotion
what
was
it
not
pleasure
not
all
surprise
surely
there
could
be
no
jealousy
mixed
with
her
feeling
for
peter
plans
but
she
was
dazed
with
the
rush
of
feeling
hurt
in
some
fashion
she
could
not
stop
to
dissect
now
only
this
morning
she
had
felt
that
peter
was
not
good
enough
for
alix
now
suddenly
he
began
to
seem
admirable
and
dear
and
unlike
everybody
else
and
she
said
no
she
stammered
in
confusion
she
said
no
or
at
least
i
intimated
that
i
was
a
lonely
old
affectionate
man
with
this
and
that
to
offer
and
she
intimated
that
that
was
enough
it
was
all
he
laughed
it
was
all
extremely
sketchy
peter
but
what
does
she
want
there
was
actual
sisterly
indignation
in
cherry
tone
oh
alix
is
quite
right
he
answered
lightly
i
ought
to
have
said
i
ought
to
explain
that
i
had
told
her
only
a
few
days
previously
that
i
had
always
loved
somebody
else
cherry
was
enlightened
she
visualized
an
affair
in
the
last
years
of
the
old
century
for
peter
oh
and
and
she
did
love
you
cherry
asked
the
lady
she
was
unfortunately
married
before
i
had
a
chance
to
ask
her
said
peter
cherry
said
again
impressed
and
you
never
get
over
it
she
asked
timidly
peter
i
never
knew
that
she
added
as
he
was
silent
does
does
dad
know
nobody
knows
but
alix
and
she
only
knows
the
bare
facts
he
assured
her
oh
cherry
could
think
of
nothing
to
add
to
the
sympathetic
little
monosyllable
twilight
was
reaching
even
the
hilltop
the
canyons
were
rilling
with
violet
shadows
the
sweet
pungent
odour
of
the
first
dew
falling
on
warm
dust
crept
across
the
garden
finished
with
the
shower
shrieked
alix
from
the
warm
darkness
inside
the
doorway
hurry
up
peter
something
smells
utterly
grand
that
the
chicken
thing
peter
shouted
back
springing
up
to
disappear
in
the
direction
of
the
bathroom
cherry
sat
on
silent
wrapped
still
in
the
new
spell
of
the
pleasant
voice
the
strangely
appealing
and
yet
masterful
personality
the
dinner
straggled
as
all
peter
dinners
did
alix
mixed
a
peter
himself
flashed
in
and
out
of
the
tiny
hot
kitchen
a
hundred
times
kow
in
immaculate
linen
came
back
and
forth
in
leisurely
suddenly
everything
was
ready
the
crisp
french
loaf
the
big
brown
jar
of
bubbling
and
odorous
chicken
the
lettuce
curled
in
its
bowl
the
bottles
in
their
straw
cases
and
cheeses
and
crackers
and
olives
and
figs
and
tiny
fish
in
oil
and
marrons
in
fluted
paper
that
were
a
part
of
all
peter
dinners
after
dinner
they
watched
the
moon
rise
until
alix
drifted
in
to
the
piano
and
peter
followed
her
and
the
others
came
in
too
to
sit
beside
the
fire
as
usual
it
was
midnight
before
any
one
thought
of
ending
one
of
peter
evenings
and
all
through
the
pleasant
quiet
hours
and
when
he
bundled
them
up
in
his
own
big
loose
coats
to
drive
them
home
cherry
was
thinking
of
him
in
this
new
light
peter
loving
a
woman
and
denied
the
knowledge
seemed
to
fling
a
strange
glamour
about
him
she
saw
new
charm
in
him
or
perhaps
as
she
told
herself
she
saw
for
the
first
time
how
charming
he
really
was
his
speech
seemed
actually
the
pleasanter
for
the
stammer
at
which
they
had
all
laughed
years
ago
the
slight
limp
lent
its
own
touch
of
individuality
and
the
man
blunt
criticisms
of
books
and
music
politics
and
people
were
softened
by
his
humour
his
genuine
humility
and
his
eager
hospitality
next
day
she
took
occasion
to
mention
peter
and
his
affairs
to
alix
alix
turned
fiery
red
but
laughed
hardily
if
he
considers
that
an
offer
he
can
consider
it
a
refusal
i
guess
she
said
boyishly
embarrassed
i
like
him
i
crazy
about
him
but
i
do
want
any
party
in
ringlets
and
crinolines
to
come
floating
from
the
dead
past
over
my
child
innocent
cradle
alix
you
awful
cherry
laughed
you
could
talk
that
way
if
you
loved
him
what
way
alix
demanded
oh
about
his
well
his
children
i
should
think
that
would
be
just
the
proof
that
i
do
love
him
alix
persisted
idly
in
her
musical
mischievous
voice
i
certainly
want
to
talk
of
the
children
of
a
man
i
did
oh
alix
do
cherry
protested
anyway
you
know
better
alix
laughed
i
suppose
i
do
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
a
mass
of
blushes
the
truth
is
i
like
kids
and
i
do
like
husbands
alix
confessed
with
engaging
candour
you
do
know
anything
about
husbands
cherry
laughed
i
know
lots
of
men
i
like
to
go
off
with
for
a
few
months
alix
pursued
but
then
i
like
to
come
home
again
i
do
see
why
that
is
perfectly
reasonable
well
it
not
cherry
declared
almost
crossly
that
is
marriage
you
belong
where
your
husband
is
and
you
you
are
always
glad
to
be
with
him
but
suppose
you
get
tired
of
him
like
a
job
or
a
or
any
of
your
other
friends
alix
persisted
idly
well
you
are
supposed
to
cherry
said
feebly
alix
let
her
have
the
last
word
it
was
only
due
to
her
superior
experience
she
thought
crossly
but
half
an
hour
later
lying
wakeful
and
thinking
that
she
would
miss
dear
old
cherry
she
fancied
she
heard
something
like
a
sob
from
cherry
bed
and
her
whole
heart
softened
with
sympathy
for
her
sister
they
came
downstairs
together
the
next
day
in
both
hatted
and
wrapped
for
the
trip
for
peter
was
to
take
cherry
as
far
as
sausalito
in
the
car
and
martin
by
a
fortunate
chance
was
to
meet
them
there
at
the
ferryboat
for
san
francisco
mill
valley
was
not
more
than
an
hour
ride
from
the
ferry
alix
was
to
drive
down
and
return
with
peter
cherry
said
to
her
father
in
the
porch
she
seemed
more
of
a
puzzled
child
than
ever
i
had
a
wonderful
visit
dad
she
began
bravely
suddenly
the
tears
came
she
buried
her
face
against
her
father
shabby
old
office
coat
and
his
arms
went
about
her
alix
laughed
awkwardly
and
peter
shut
his
teeth
anne
who
had
very
properly
come
over
to
say
to
her
cousin
got
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
and
alix
took
the
seat
beside
her
take
a
picture
of
peter
and
me
with
the
suitcases
she
said
we
must
look
so
domestic
get
in
here
cherry
peter
said
opening
the
door
of
the
seat
beside
his
own
doctor
we
be
back
in
about
an
hour
without
cherry
her
father
said
with
a
rueful
smile
without
cherry
peter
echoed
looking
at
her
gravely
it
was
then
that
cherry
saw
in
peter
expression
something
that
she
did
not
forget
for
many
many
months
never
quite
forgot
he
wore
a
rough
tramping
costume
a
sunday
and
he
was
halfway
up
the
porch
steps
ready
to
carry
bags
to
the
waiting
motor
car
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
something
so
yearning
so
loving
so
troubled
in
their
gaze
that
a
thrill
went
through
cherry
from
head
to
foot
he
instantly
averted
his
look
turned
to
the
car
fumbled
with
the
gears
they
were
off
he
was
to
drive
them
all
the
way
to
sausalito
alix
commented
joyously
upon
the
beauty
of
the
day
cherry
tied
trimly
into
a
hat
that
was
all
big
daisies
was
silent
for
a
while
but
when
alix
and
anne
commenced
an
interested
conversation
in
the
back
seat
she
suddenly
said
regretfully
oh
i
hate
to
go
away
this
time
i
mind
it
more
even
than
the
first
time
peter
edging
smoothly
about
a
wide
blue
puddle
nodded
sympathetically
but
did
not
answer
i
envy
alix
cherry
said
in
idle
mischief
she
knew
that
the
subject
was
not
a
safe
one
but
was
irresistibly
impelled
to
pursue
it
alix
said
peter
after
a
silence
long
enough
to
make
her
feel
ashamed
of
herself
yes
her
young
man
lives
in
mill
valley
right
near
home
elucidated
cherry
am
i
alix
young
man
he
asked
amused
well
are
you
i
do
know
i
never
been
any
one
young
man
said
peter
whoever
the
woman
who
treated
you
meanly
is
i
hate
her
cherry
began
again
unless
she
added
unless
she
was
very
young
and
you
never
told
her
this
time
he
did
not
answer
at
all
and
they
spun
along
in
utter
silence
but
when
they
were
nearing
sausalito
cherry
said
almost
timidly
i
think
perhaps
it
would
make
her
happy
and
proud
to
know
that
you
admired
her
peter
i
do
know
who
she
is
of
course
but
almost
any
woman
would
feel
that
this
visit
somehow
has
made
me
feel
as
if
you
and
i
had
really
begun
a
new
friendship
on
our
own
account
not
just
the
old
friendship
and
i
shall
often
think
of
that
talk
we
had
a
week
ago
of
you
too
time
you
fall
in
love
i
hope
you
will
be
luckier
silence
but
he
gave
her
his
quick
friendly
smile
cherry
dared
not
speak
again
last
stop
all
out
alix
exclaimed
you
get
tickets
peter
hurray
there
martin
unexpectedly
martin
big
figure
came
toward
them
from
the
ferry
gate
some
ore
from
the
mine
had
to
be
assayed
in
san
francisco
and
he
had
volunteered
to
make
the
trip
so
that
he
might
meet
his
wife
and
bring
her
back
with
him
to
red
creek
time
hanging
on
his
hands
in
the
city
he
had
crossed
the
bay
for
the
pleasure
of
the
return
trip
with
cherry
he
met
them
beamingly
there
was
a
little
confusion
of
greeting
and
alix
and
peter
watched
the
others
at
the
railing
until
the
ferryboat
turned
martin
smiled
over
anne
head
cherry
both
little
hands
on
the
rail
blue
eyes
and
a
glint
of
bright
hair
showing
under
the
daisies
on
her
hat
her
small
figure
enveloped
in
a
big
loose
coat
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
cry
again
it
must
be
fun
to
be
married
and
go
off
to
strange
places
with
your
beau
alix
decided
i
hungry
peter
let
go
over
there
and
treat
ourselves
to
fried
oysters
let
go
home
he
said
unsympathetically
i
not
hungry
oh
very
well
alix
agreed
airily
jumping
into
the
seat
beside
him
though
what
has
given
you
a
grouch
i
really
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
she
added
under
her
breath
i
do
hear
you
shouted
peter
who
was
suddenly
rushing
the
engine
you
were
intended
to
she
shouted
back
and
until
they
were
halfway
home
and
alix
laughed
out
in
sudden
shame
and
not
another
word
was
spoken
the
bright
weather
had
changed
suddenly
and
a
wet
spring
cloud
was
spreading
over
the
sky
love
me
peter
alix
asked
suddenly
not
always
he
answered
briefly
and
sincerely
fog
was
creeping
over
the
marshes
the
air
was
full
of
damp
chill
a
memory
of
the
figure
and
the
blue
eyes
that
smiled
wistfully
under
a
daisied
hat
was
wringing
his
heart
listen
began
alix
again
let
stop
for
dad
it
going
to
pour
and
let
go
up
to
your
house
to
eat
silence
we
can
play
duets
all
evening
alix
added
temptingly
little
and
anne
coming
back
peter
asked
unwillingly
no
they
dining
with
the
quelquechoses
those
freckled
cousins
of
his
alix
answered
i
do
know
that
i
got
anything
up
there
to
eat
peter
said
gloomily
ooo
say
alix
said
brightening
suddenly
with
her
incorrigible
childishness
of
expression
kow
got
eggs
and
cream
has
he
make
that
new
thing
i
was
telling
you
about
it
delicious
oh
and
an
onion
she
broke
off
in
concern
he
has
an
onion
peter
admitted
what
dish
he
asked
interested
in
spite
of
himself
as
alix
fell
into
a
rapturous
reverie
well
you
fry
a
chopped
onion
alix
began
and
then
you
have
a
lot
of
eggs
in
another
moment
they
were
deep
in
culinary
details
chapter
viii
martin
work
was
in
the
contra
costa
valley
and
he
and
cherry
had
a
small
house
in
red
creek
the
only
town
of
any
size
near
the
mine
red
creek
was
in
a
and
dairy
region
and
looked
its
prettiest
on
the
spring
evening
when
cherry
saw
it
first
the
locusts
were
in
leaf
and
ready
to
bloom
and
the
first
fruit
blossoms
were
scattered
in
snowy
whiteness
up
and
down
the
valley
her
little
house
was
a
cottage
with
a
porch
running
across
the
front
where
windows
looked
out
from
the
sitting
room
and
the
front
bedroom
back
of
these
rooms
were
a
dark
little
bathroom
that
connected
the
front
bedroom
with
another
smaller
bedroom
a
little
dining
room
and
a
kitchen
almost
all
the
houses
in
red
creek
were
duplicates
except
in
minor
particulars
of
this
house
but
this
particular
specimen
was
older
than
some
of
the
others
and
showed
signs
of
hard
usage
the
kitchen
floor
was
chipped
and
stained
and
the
bathroom
basin
was
plugged
with
putty
there
were
odd
bottles
partly
full
of
shoe
polish
and
ink
and
vinegar
here
and
there
and
on
the
shelves
of
the
triangular
closet
in
the
dining
room
were
cut
and
folded
pieces
of
spotted
white
paper
martin
had
merely
camped
in
kitchen
and
bedroom
while
awaiting
his
wife
but
cherry
buttoned
on
her
crisp
little
apron
on
the
first
morning
after
her
arrival
and
attacked
the
accumulated
dishes
in
the
sink
and
the
scattered
shirts
and
collars
bravely
it
was
a
cold
raw
morning
and
she
went
to
and
fro
briskly
burning
rubbish
in
the
airtight
stove
in
the
sitting
room
and
keeping
a
good
wood
fire
going
in
the
kitchen
and
feeling
housewifely
and
efficient
as
she
did
so
after
a
lunch
for
which
she
was
praised
and
applauded
in
something
of
the
old
honeymoon
way
she
walked
to
market
passing
blocks
of
other
little
houses
like
her
own
with
bare
dooryards
where
nipped
chrysanthemums
dangled
on
poles
and
where
play
wagons
puddles
of
water
and
picking
chickens
alternated
regularly
other
marketing
women
looked
at
cherry
with
the
quickly
averted
look
that
is
only
given
to
beauty
but
the
men
in
the
shops
wrote
down
the
new
name
and
address
with
especial
zeal
and
amiability
she
remembered
the
old
necessities
bacon
and
lard
and
sugar
and
matches
she
recovered
the
kitchen
clock
from
its
wrapping
of
newspaper
and
wound
it
and
set
it
on
the
sink
shelf
she
was
busy
with
a
hundred
improvements
and
cares
and
was
almost
too
tired
when
martin
came
home
to
dinner
to
sit
up
and
share
it
with
him
it
was
warm
in
the
dining
room
and
cherry
yawned
over
her
dessert
and
rose
stiff
and
aching
to
return
to
the
kitchen
with
plates
and
silver
glasses
and
food
to
shake
the
tablecloth
to
pile
and
wash
and
wipe
and
put
away
the
china
to
brush
the
floor
and
the
stove
and
do
the
last
wiping
and
wringing
and
to
turn
out
the
gas
and
go
in
to
her
chair
beside
the
airtight
stove
martin
handed
her
half
his
paper
and
cherry
took
it
realizing
with
cheerful
indifference
that
there
was
a
streak
of
soot
on
one
cuff
and
that
her
hands
were
affected
by
grease
and
hot
water
she
read
jokes
and
recipes
and
answers
to
correspondents
and
small
editorial
fillers
as
to
the
number
of
nutmegs
consumed
in
china
yearly
and
the
name
and
circumstances
of
the
oldest
living
man
in
england
a
new
novel
was
in
her
bedroom
but
she
was
too
comfortable
and
too
tired
to
go
get
it
and
at
ten
she
rose
yawning
and
stumbling
and
went
to
bed
breakfast
must
be
on
the
table
at
seven
for
martin
left
for
the
mine
at
eight
and
she
had
had
a
hard
day
for
a
few
weeks
the
novelty
lasted
and
cherry
was
enthusiastic
about
everything
she
looked
out
across
her
dishpan
at
green
fields
and
the
beginning
of
the
farms
she
saw
the
lilacs
burst
into
fragrant
plumes
on
the
bare
branches
of
her
dooryard
trees
spring
flushed
the
whole
world
with
loveliness
and
she
was
young
and
healthy
and
too
busy
to
be
homesick
martin
left
the
house
at
eight
and
was
usually
at
home
at
five
he
would
sometimes
come
into
her
kitchen
while
she
finished
dinner
and
tell
her
about
the
day
and
then
suggested
that
they
go
to
the
pictures
at
night
but
although
cherry
and
alix
often
had
coaxed
their
father
into
this
dissipation
in
mill
valley
it
was
different
there
she
found
that
was
a
small
colony
of
city
people
the
theatre
was
small
and
the
films
carefully
selected
one
sat
with
neighbours
and
friends
but
here
in
red
creek
the
theatre
was
a
draughty
barn
and
the
farm
workers
big
men
odorous
of
warm
acid
perspiration
pushed
in
laughing
and
noisy
the
films
were
of
a
different
character
too
and
advertised
by
frightful
coloured
posters
at
the
doors
martin
himself
did
not
like
them
indeed
he
and
cherry
found
little
to
like
in
either
the
people
or
the
town
it
was
a
typical
railroad
town
of
california
it
was
flat
dusty
all
its
buildings
of
wood
there
were
some
two
thousand
souls
in
red
creek
two
or
three
stores
a
bakery
from
which
the
crude
odour
of
baking
bread
burst
every
night
saloons
warehouses
a
smithy
a
butcher
shop
open
only
two
days
a
week
a
chinese
laundry
from
which
steam
issued
all
day
and
all
night
cattle
sheds
pepper
trees
wheat
barns
and
a
hotel
of
raw
pine
with
a
narrow
bedroom
represented
by
every
one
of
the
forty
narrow
windows
in
its
upper
stories
and
a
lower
floor
decorated
with
spittoons
back
of
the
crowded
main
street
was
another
street
beside
which
main
street
muddy
ugliness
was
beautiful
here
was
another
saloon
and
rooms
above
it
and
several
disreputable
cottages
about
which
cherry
sometimes
saw
women
not
everyone
in
red
creek
was
poor
by
any
means
it
was
a
district
bursting
with
prosperity
all
summer
long
wheat
and
fruit
and
butter
and
beef
poured
through
it
out
into
the
world
down
the
road
a
mile
or
two
and
back
toward
the
far
hills
were
comfortable
ranches
where
trees
planted
fifty
years
before
had
grown
to
mammoth
proportions
and
where
the
women
of
the
family
cultivated
gardens
every
family
had
pigs
and
cattle
and
fine
horses
and
motor
cars
were
familiar
sights
in
red
creek
streets
cherry
used
to
wonder
why
anybody
who
could
live
elsewhere
lived
here
when
some
of
the
ranch
girls
told
her
that
they
always
did
their
shopping
in
san
francisco
she
marvelled
that
they
could
reconcile
themselves
to
come
home
the
days
went
on
and
on
each
bringing
its
round
of
dishes
beds
sweeping
marketing
folding
and
unfolding
tablecloths
going
back
and
forth
between
kitchen
and
dining
room
martin
breakfast
was
either
promptly
served
and
well
cooked
in
which
case
martin
was
silently
satisfied
or
it
was
late
and
a
failure
when
he
was
very
articulately
disgusted
in
either
case
cherry
was
left
to
clear
and
wash
and
plan
for
another
meal
in
four
hours
more
she
soaked
fruit
beat
up
cake
chopped
boxes
into
kindlings
heated
a
kettle
of
water
and
another
kettle
of
water
dragged
sheets
from
the
bed
only
to
replace
them
filled
dishes
with
food
only
to
find
them
empty
and
ready
to
wash
again
i
get
sick
of
it
she
told
martin
well
lord
he
exclaimed
do
you
think
everybody
does
do
i
get
sick
of
my
work
you
ought
to
have
the
responsibility
of
it
all
for
a
while
his
tone
was
humorously
reproving
rather
than
unkind
but
such
a
speech
would
fill
cherry
eyes
with
tears
and
cause
her
to
go
about
the
house
all
morning
with
a
heavy
heart
she
would
find
herself
looking
thoughtfully
at
martin
in
these
days
studying
him
as
if
he
were
an
utter
stranger
it
bewildered
her
to
feel
that
he
actually
was
no
more
than
that
after
two
years
of
marriage
she
not
only
did
not
know
him
but
she
had
a
baffled
sense
that
the
very
nearness
of
their
union
prevented
her
from
seeing
him
fairly
she
knew
that
she
did
him
injustice
in
her
thoughts
it
must
be
injustice
decided
cherry
for
martin
seemed
to
her
less
clever
less
just
less
intelligent
and
less
generous
than
the
average
man
of
her
acquaintance
and
yet
he
did
not
seem
to
impress
other
people
in
the
way
he
impressed
her
he
was
extraordinarily
healthy
and
had
small
sympathy
for
illness
weakness
for
the
unfortunate
and
the
complaining
he
was
scrupulously
clean
and
cherry
added
that
to
his
credit
although
the
necessity
of
seeing
that
martin
bath
martin
shaving
water
and
martin
clean
linen
were
ready
complicated
her
duties
somewhat
he
was
not
interested
in
the
affairs
of
the
day
politics
reforms
world
movements
generally
found
him
indifferent
but
he
would
occasionally
favour
his
wife
with
a
sudden
opinion
as
to
china
or
intensive
farming
or
lloyd
shipping
she
knew
when
he
did
this
that
he
was
quoting
he
whistled
over
his
dressing
read
the
paper
at
breakfast
and
was
gone
at
noon
he
rushed
in
always
late
devoured
his
lunch
appreciatively
and
was
gone
again
at
night
he
was
usually
tired
inclined
to
quarrel
about
small
matters
inclined
to
disapprove
of
the
new
positions
of
the
bedroom
furniture
or
the
way
cherry
hair
was
dressed
he
loved
to
play
poker
and
was
hospitable
to
a
certain
extent
he
would
whistle
and
joke
over
the
preparations
for
a
rarebit
after
a
game
and
would
willingly
walk
five
blocks
for
beer
if
cherry
had
forgotten
to
get
it
on
sunday
he
liked
to
see
her
prettily
gowned
now
and
then
they
motored
with
his
friends
from
the
mine
more
often
walked
ate
a
hearty
chicken
dinner
and
went
to
a
cold
supper
in
the
neighbourhood
with
five
hundred
to
follow
at
ten
their
hostess
would
flutter
into
her
kitchen
there
would
be
lemonade
and
beer
and
rich
layer
cake
then
the
men
would
begin
to
match
poker
hands
and
the
women
to
discuss
babies
in
low
tones
cherry
never
saw
her
husband
so
animated
or
so
interested
as
when
men
he
had
known
before
chanced
to
drift
into
town
mining
men
from
nevada
or
from
el
nido
or
men
he
had
known
in
college
they
would
discuss
personalities
would
shout
over
recollected
good
times
would
slap
each
other
on
the
back
and
laugh
tirelessly
she
thought
him
an
extremely
difficult
man
to
live
with
and
was
angered
when
her
hints
to
this
effect
led
him
to
remark
that
she
was
the
limit
they
had
a
serious
quarrel
one
day
when
he
told
her
that
she
was
the
most
selfish
and
spoiled
woman
he
had
ever
known
he
called
her
attention
to
the
other
women
of
the
town
busy
contented
women
sending
children
off
to
school
settling
babies
down
for
naps
in
sunny
dooryards
cooking
and
laughing
and
hurrying
to
and
fro
yes
and
look
at
them
cherry
said
with
ready
tears
shabby
thin
tired
all
the
time
the
trouble
with
you
is
martin
said
departing
you
been
told
that
you
pretty
and
sweet
all
your
life
and
you
spoiled
you
are
pretty
yes
he
added
more
mildly
but
by
george
you
sulk
so
much
and
you
crab
so
much
that
i
darned
if
i
see
it
any
more
all
i
see
is
trouble
with
this
he
left
her
left
her
to
a
burst
of
angry
tears
at
first
when
she
dropped
her
lovely
little
head
on
the
blue
gingham
of
her
apron
sleeve
and
cried
bitterly
the
kettle
began
to
sing
on
the
stove
a
bee
came
in
and
wandered
about
the
hot
kitchen
the
grocer
knocked
and
cherry
let
the
big
lout
of
a
boy
stare
at
her
red
eyes
uncaring
then
she
went
swiftly
into
the
bedroom
and
began
to
pack
and
change
she
show
martin
lloyd
she
show
martin
lloyd
she
was
going
straight
to
dad
she
take
the
take
the
she
frowned
she
had
missed
the
nine
train
she
must
wait
for
the
train
at
two
wait
where
well
she
could
only
wait
here
very
well
she
would
wait
here
she
would
not
get
martin
any
lunch
and
when
he
raged
she
would
explain
she
finished
her
packing
and
put
the
house
in
order
then
in
unaccustomed
leisure
she
sank
into
a
deep
rocker
and
began
to
read
quiet
and
shade
and
order
reigned
in
the
little
house
outside
in
the
shaded
street
the
children
went
shouting
home
again
a
fishman
horn
sounded
steps
came
bounding
up
to
cherry
door
her
heart
began
to
beat
a
knock
sounded
she
got
to
her
feet
puzzled
martin
did
not
knock
it
was
joe
robinson
his
closest
friend
at
the
mine
his
handsome
face
was
full
of
concern
say
listen
lloyd
mart
ca

home
to
dinner
said
joe
he
do
feel
extra
well
he
was
in
the
engine
room
and
he
kinder
he
kinder

cherry
asked
sharply
turning
a
little
pale
well
kinder
lawson
made
him
lay
down
joe
said
and
he
coming
home
when
the
wagon
comes
down
at
three
he
says
to
tell
you
he
fine
oh
thank
you
joe
cherry
said
she
shut
the
door
feeling
weak
and
frightened
she
flew
to
unpack
her
bag
hung
up
her
hat
and
coat
darkened
the
bedroom
and
turned
down
the
bed
waited
anxiously
for
mart
return
turner
came
in
with
the
baby
a
gentle
tired
woman
with
a
face
always
radiant
with
joy
turner
had
seven
children
and
had
once
told
cherry
that
she
had
never
slept
a
night
through
since
the
first
year
of
her
marriage
she
never
changed
a
baby
gown
or
rolled
a
batch
of
cookies
without
a
deep
and
genuine
love
for
the
task
she
could
not
unbutton
the
twisted
collar
from
a
son
small
neck
without
drawing
his
freckled
cheek
to
her
hungry
lips
for
a
kiss
or
ask
one
of
her
daughters
to
hang
up
a
dish
towel
without
adding
you
a
darling
help
to
your
mother
the
turners
lived
next
door
to
the
lloyds
in
a
shabby
house
and
though
cherry
and
her
neighbour
spoke
a
different
language
they
had
grown
fond
of
each
other
cherry
had
sometimes
timidly
touched
upon
the
matter
that
was
always
troubling
her
with
the
older
woman
but
turner
had
little
to
say
regarding
her
feeling
for
the
lean
silent
somewhat
unsuccessful
man
who
was
the
head
of
her
crowded
household
she
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
sometimes
be
unreasonable
papa
gets
so
mad
if
anything
gets
burned
she
would
say
with
her
gentle
laugh
and
once
she
added
the
information
that
her
mother
had
been
a
wonderful
manager
men
are
that
way
was
her
comment
upon
the
difficulties
of
other
wives
but
once
when
there
was
a
wedding
near
by
cherry
with
others
in
the
church
saw
the
tears
in
turner
eyes
as
she
watched
the
bride
poor
little
innocent
thing
she
had
whispered
with
a
tremulous
smile
she
was
deeply
concerned
over
the
news
from
martin
and
when
cherry
had
met
his
limp
form
at
the
front
door
and
had
whisked
him
into
a
cool
bed
and
put
chopped
ice
on
the
aching
forehead
and
gotten
him
grateful
and
penitent
off
to
sleep
her
neighbour
came
over
again
to
whisper
in
the
kitchen
he
all
right
cherry
smiled
he
was
so
glad
to
get
to
bed
and
so
appreciative
she
added
in
a
motherly
tone
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
the
older
housekeeper
commented
glancing
about
the
neat
quiet
kitchen
i
believe
i
like
sick
nursing
cherry
smiled
back
for
a
day
or
two
martin
stayed
in
bed
and
cherry
spoiled
and
petted
him
and
was
praised
and
thanked
for
every
step
she
took
after
that
they
took
a
little
trip
into
the
mountains
near
by
and
cherry
sent
alix
postcards
that
made
her
sister
feel
almost
a
pang
of
envy
but
then
the
routine
began
again
and
the
fearful
heat
of
midsummer
came
too
red
creek
baked
in
a
smother
of
dusty
heat
the
trees
in
the
dry
orchards
beside
the
dry
roads
dropped
circles
of
hot
shadow
on
the
clodded
rough
earth
farms
dozed
under
shimmering
lines
of
dazzling
air
and
in
the
village
from
ten
until
the
afternoon
began
to
wane
there
was
no
stir
flies
buzzed
and
settled
on
screen
doors
the
creek
shrunk
away
between
crumbling
rocky
banks
the
butcher
closed
his
shop
and
milk
soured
in
the
bottles
the
turners
and
some
other
families
always
camped
together
in
the
mountains
during
this
season
and
they
were
off
when
school
closed
in
an
enviable
state
of
ecstasy
and
anticipation
cherry
had
planned
to
join
them
but
an
experimental
was
enough
the
camp
was
in
the
cool
woods
truly
but
it
was
disorderly
swarming
with
children
the
tents
were
small
and
hot
the
whole
settlement
laughed
and
rioted
and
surged
to
and
fro
in
a
manner
utterly
foreign
to
her
she
returned
to
tell
martin
that
it
was
horribly
common
and
weather
the
rest
of
the
summer
in
red
creek
turner
is
the
only
woman
that
i
can
stand
said
cherry
and
she
was
always
cooking
in
an
awful
cooking
shed
masses
and
masses
of
macaroni
and
stewed
plums
and
biscuits
and
all
of
them
laughing
and
saying
i
guess
you
got
a
hollow
leg
dearie
i
eat
any
more
without
busting
and
sitting
round
that
plank
table
martin
shouted
with
laughter
at
her
but
he
sympathized
he
had
never
cared
particularly
for
the
turners
was
perfectly
willing
to
keep
the
friendship
within
bounds
he
sympathized
as
little
with
another
friendship
she
made
some
months
later
with
the
wife
of
a
young
engineer
who
had
recently
come
to
the
mine
pauline
runyon
was
a
few
years
older
than
her
husband
a
handsome
thin
intense
woman
who
did
everything
in
an
entirely
individual
way
she
took
one
of
the
new
little
bungalows
that
were
being
erected
in
red
creek
park
and
furnished
it
richly
and
inappropriately
and
established
a
tea
table
and
a
samovar
beside
the
open
fireplace
cherry
began
to
like
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
the
hours
she
spent
with
pauline
she
would
have
liked
to
go
every
day
and
every
day
argued
and
debated
the
propriety
of
doing
so
in
her
heart
not
since
the
days
of
her
engagement
to
martin
and
then
only
on
a
few
occasions
had
she
felt
the
thrill
that
she
experienced
now
when
pauline
with
her
dark
eyes
and
her
frilly
parasol
wandered
in
the
kitchen
door
to
sit
laughing
and
talking
for
a
few
minutes
or
when
she
herself
dressed
and
crossed
the
village
and
went
up
past
the
packing
plant
and
the
storage
barns
to
the
two
small
cement
gate
posts
and
the
length
of
rusty
chain
that
marked
the
entrance
to
red
creek
park
then
there
would
be
tea
poetry
talk
and
the
flattery
that
pauline
quite
deliberately
applied
to
cherry
and
the
flattery
that
cherry
all
unconsciously
lavished
on
her
friend
in
return
pauline
read
browning
francis
thompson
and
pater
and
introduced
cherry
to
new
worlds
of
thought
she
talked
to
cherry
of
new
york
which
she
loved
and
of
the
men
and
women
she
had
met
there
she
sometimes
sighed
and
pushed
the
bright
hair
back
from
cherry
young
and
innocent
and
discontented
little
face
and
said
tenderly
on
the
stage
my
dear
anywhere
everywhere
you
would
be
a
furore
and
thinking
in
the
quiet
evenings
for
martin
work
kept
him
later
and
later
at
the
mine
cherry
came
to
see
that
her
marriage
had
been
a
great
mistake
she
had
not
been
ready
for
marriage
she
would
sit
on
the
back
steps
as
the
evenings
grew
cooler
and
watch
the
exquisite
twilight
fade
and
the
sorrow
and
beauty
of
life
would
wring
her
heart
darkness
came
the
turner
children
shrieked
laughed
clattered
dishes
and
were
silent
cherry
would
sit
on
her
arms
wrapped
in
her
apron
her
eyes
staring
into
the
young
night
in
the
darkness
she
could
only
see
the
great
shadows
that
were
the
adams
windmill
and
the
old
brown
barn
and
the
cutters
house
down
the
back
road
the
dry
earth
seemed
awake
at
night
stretching
itself
under
brown
sods
for
a
great
breath
of
relief
in
the
merciful
coolness
cherry
could
smell
grapes
and
smell
the
pleasant
wetness
of
the
dust
where
the
late
watering
cart
had
passed
by
after
sunset
the
roads
were
too
hot
for
watering
all
day
long
and
this
sweet
wet
odour
only
came
with
the
night
a
dream
of
ease
and
adoration
and
beauty
came
to
her
she
did
not
visualize
any
special
place
any
special
gown
or
hour
or
person
but
she
saw
her
beauty
fittingly
environed
she
saw
cool
rooms
darkened
against
this
blazing
midsummer
glare
heard
ice
clinking
against
glass
the
footsteps
of
attentive
maids
the
sound
of
cultivated
voices
of
music
and
laughter
she
had
had
these
dreams
before
but
they
were
becoming
habitual
now
she
was
so
tired
so
sick
so
bored
with
her
real
life
it
was
becoming
increasingly
harder
and
harder
for
her
to
live
with
martin
to
endure
and
to
struggle
against
the
pricks
she
was
always
in
a
suppressed
state
of
wanting
to
break
out
to
shout
at
him
brazenly
i
do
care
if
your
coffee
is
weak
i
like
it
weak
i
care
if
you
do
like
my
hat
i
do
stop
talking
about
yourself
various
little
mannerisms
of
his
began
seriously
to
annoy
her
a
rather
grave
symptom
had
cherry
but
known
it
he
danced
his
big
fingers
on
the
handle
of
the
sugar
spoon
at
breakfast
sifting
the
sugar
over
his
cereal
she
had
to
turn
her
eyes
resolutely
away
from
the
sight
he
blew
his
nose
folded
his
handkerchief
and
then
brushed
his
nose
with
it
firmly
left
and
right
she
hated
the
little
performance
that
was
never
altered
he
had
a
certain
mental
slowness
would
blink
at
her
politely
and
patiently
when
she
flashed
plans
or
hopes
at
him
i
follow
you
my
dear
this
made
her
frantic
she
was
twenty
undisciplined
and
exacting
she
had
no
reserves
within
herself
to
which
she
could
turn
bad
things
were
hopelessly
bad
with
cherry
her
despairs
were
the
dark
and
tearful
despairs
of
girlhood
prematurely
transferred
to
graver
matters
martin
was
quite
right
in
some
of
his
contentions
she
was
spasmodic
and
unsystematic
in
her
housekeeping
she
had
times
of
being
discontented
and
selfish
she
hated
economy
and
the
need
for
careful
managing
in
october
alix
chanced
to
write
her
a
long
and
unusually
gossipy
letter
alix
had
a
new
gown
of
black
grenadine
and
she
had
sung
at
an
afternoon
tea
and
had
evidently
succeeded
in
her
first
venture
also
they
had
had
a
mountain
climb
and
enclosed
were
snapshots
peter
had
taken
on
the
trip
cherry
picked
up
the
little
kodak
prints
there
were
four
or
five
of
them
she
studied
them
with
a
pang
at
her
heart
alix
in
a
loose
rough
coat
with
her
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
and
the
peaked
crest
of
tamalpais
behind
her
alix
busy
with
lunch
boxes
alix
standing
on
the
old
bridge
down
by
the
mill
a
wave
of
homesickness
swept
over
the
younger
sister
life
tasted
bitter
she
hated
alix
hated
peter
above
all
she
hated
herself
she
wanted
to
be
there
in
mill
valley
free
to
play
and
to
dream
again
a
day
or
two
later
she
told
martin
kindly
and
steadily
that
she
thought
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
she
told
him
that
she
thought
the
only
dignified
thing
to
do
was
to
part
she
liked
him
she
would
always
wish
him
well
but
since
the
love
had
gone
out
of
their
relationship
surely
it
was
only
honest
to
end
it
what
the
matter
martin
demanded
nothing
special
cherry
assured
him
her
eyes
suddenly
watering
only
i
tired
of
it
all
i
tired
of
pretending
i
ca
argue
about
it
but
i
know
it
the
wise
thing
to
do
you
acted
this
same
way
before
martin
suggested
after
looking
back
at
his
paper
for
a
few
seconds
i
did
not
cherry
said
indignantly
that
is
not
true
you
go
back
to
your
father
i
suppose
martin
said
yawning
until
i
could
get
into
something
cherry
replied
with
dignity
a
vague
thought
of
the
stage
flitted
through
her
mind
oh
martin
said
politely
and
i
suppose
you
think
your
father
would
agree
to
this
delightful
arrangement
he
asked
i
know
he
would
cherry
answered
eagerly
all
right
you
write
and
ask
him
martin
agreed
cherry
was
surprised
at
his
attitude
but
grateful
more
than
surprised
not
cross
mart
she
asked
not
the
least
in
the
world
he
answered
lightly
because
i
truly
believe
that
we
both
be
happier
the
woman
said
hesitatingly
martin
did
not
answer
the
next
day
she
sat
down
to
write
her
father
the
house
was
still
red
creek
was
awakening
in
the
heavenly
october
coolness
children
chattered
on
the
way
to
school
the
morning
and
evening
were
crisp
and
sharp
cherry
stared
out
at
a
field
of
stubble
bathed
in
soft
sunshine
the
hills
were
only
a
shade
deeper
than
the
pale
sky
along
the
road
back
of
the
house
a
lumber
wagon
rattled
the
thin
bay
horses
galloping
joyously
in
harness
pink
and
white
cosmos
pallid
on
clouds
of
frail
bushy
green
were
banked
in
the
shade
of
the
woodshed
she
meditated
with
a
troubled
brow
her
letter
was
unexpectedly
hard
to
compose
she
could
not
take
a
bright
and
simple
tone
asking
her
father
to
rejoice
in
her
somehow
the
matter
persisted
in
growing
heavy
and
the
words
twisted
themselves
about
into
ugly
and
selfish
sounds
cherry
was
young
but
even
to
her
youth
the
phrases
the
misunderstood
and
the
uncongenial
the
friendly
parting
before
any
bitterness
creeps
in
and
the
free
to
decide
our
lives
in
some
happier
and
wiser
way
rang
false
pauline
had
been
divorced
a
few
years
ago
and
the
only
thing
cherry
disliked
in
her
friend
was
her
cold
and
resentful
references
to
her
first
husband
no
she
could
be
a
divorced
woman
it
was
all
spoiled
the
innocent
past
and
the
future
there
was
no
way
out
she
gave
up
the
attempt
at
a
letter
and
began
to
annoy
martin
with
talk
of
a
visit
home
again
you
were
there
six
months
ago
martin
reminded
her
eight
months
ago
mart
what
you
want
to
go
for
oh
just
just
cherry
irrepressible
tears
angered
herself
almost
as
much
as
they
did
martin
i
think
they
like
me
to
she
faltered
go
if
you
want
to
he
said
but
she
knew
she
could
not
go
on
that
word
that
it
she
said
at
last
to
herself
in
one
of
her
solitary
hours
i
married
and
this
is
marriage
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
be
mart
and
i
mart
and
i
in
everything
for
richer
for
poorer
for
better
for
marriage
he
does
beat
me
and
we
have
enough
money
and
perhaps
there
are
a
lot
of
other
women
worse
off
than
i
am
but
it
it
funny
chapter
ix
in
january
however
he
came
home
one
noon
to
find
her
hatted
and
wrapped
to
go
oh
mart
it
daddy
she
said
he
ill
i
got
to
see
him
awfully
telegram
asked
martin
not
particularly
pleased
but
not
unsympathetic
either
for
answer
she
gave
him
the
yellow
paper
that
was
wet
with
her
tears
dad
ill
he
read
do
worry
come
if
you
can
alix
i
bet
it
a
job
between
you
and
alix
martin
said
in
indulgent
suspicion
her
indignant
glance
sobered
him
he
hastily
arranged
money
matters
and
that
night
she
got
off
the
train
in
the
dark
wetness
of
the
valley
and
was
met
by
a
rush
of
cool
and
fragrant
air
it
was
too
late
to
see
the
mountain
lights
were
twinkling
everywhere
in
the
dark
trees
cherry
got
a
driver
rattled
and
jerked
up
to
the
house
in
a
surrey
and
jumped
out
her
heart
almost
suffocating
her
alix
came
flying
to
the
door
the
old
lamplight
and
the
odour
of
wood
smoke
poured
through
there
was
no
need
for
words
they
burst
into
tears
and
clung
together
an
hour
later
cherry
feeling
as
if
she
was
not
the
same
woman
who
waked
in
red
creek
this
same
morning
and
got
martin
eggs
and
coffee
ready
crept
into
her
father
room
alix
had
warned
her
to
be
quiet
but
at
the
sight
of
the
majestic
old
gray
head
and
the
fine
old
hands
clasped
together
on
the
sheet
her
forsook
her
entirely
and
she
fell
to
her
knees
and
began
to
cry
again
the
nurse
looked
at
her
disapprovingly
but
after
all
it
made
little
difference
doctor
strickland
roused
only
once
again
and
that
was
many
hours
later
cherry
and
alix
were
still
keeping
their
vigil
cherry
worn
out
had
been
dozing
the
nurse
was
resting
on
a
couch
in
the
next
room
suddenly
both
daughters
were
wide
awake
at
the
sound
of
the
hoarse
yet
familiar
voice
alix
fell
on
her
knees
and
caught
the
cold
and
wandering
hand
what
is
it
darling
the
old
maternal
manner
was
all
in
earnest
now
peter
he
said
thickly
peter
in
china
dear
you
remember
that
peter
was
to
go
around
the
world
you
remember
that
dad
in
the
with
a
donkey
he
said
rationally
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
dubiously
we
all
read
that
together
alix
encouraged
him
no
he
said
musingly
they
thought
he
slept
again
but
he
presently
added
somewhere
in
matthew
no
in
mark
mark
is
the
human
one
mark
was
as
human
as
his
master
shall
i
read
you
from
mark
alix
asked
as
his
voice
sank
again
a
shabby
old
bible
always
stood
at
her
father
bedside
she
reached
for
it
and
making
a
desperate
effort
to
steady
her
voice
began
to
read
the
place
was
marked
by
an
old
letter
and
opened
at
the
chapter
he
seemed
to
desire
for
as
she
read
he
seemed
to
be
drinking
in
the
words
once
they
heard
him
whisper
wonderful
cherry
got
up
on
the
bed
and
took
the
splendid
dying
head
in
her
arms
the
murky
winter
dawn
crept
in
and
the
lamp
burned
sickly
in
the
daylight
hong
could
be
heard
stirring
alix
closed
the
book
and
extinguished
the
lamp
cherry
did
not
move
charity
the
old
man
said
presently
in
a
simple
childish
tone
later
with
bursts
of
tears
in
all
the
utter
desolation
of
the
days
that
followed
cherry
loved
to
remember
that
his
last
utterance
was
her
name
but
alix
knew
though
she
never
said
it
that
it
was
to
another
charity
he
spoke
subdued
looking
younger
and
thinner
in
their
new
black
the
sisters
came
downstairs
ten
days
later
for
a
business
talk
peter
had
been
named
as
one
executor
but
peter
was
far
away
and
it
was
a
pleasant
family
friend
a
kindly
old
surgeon
of
doctor
strickland
own
age
or
near
it
and
the
lawyer
george
sewall
the
other
executor
who
told
them
about
their
affairs
anne
as
was
present
at
this
talk
with
justin
sitting
close
beside
her
martin
too
who
had
come
down
for
the
funeral
was
there
cherry
was
white
headachy
indifferent
she
seemed
stunned
by
her
loss
but
alix
extraordinary
vitality
had
already
asserted
itself
and
she
set
herself
earnestly
to
understand
their
somewhat
complicated
affairs
the
house
went
to
the
daughters
there
were
books
and
portraits
for
anne
a
box
or
two
in
storage
for
anne
and
anne
was
mentioned
in
the
only
will
as
equally
inheriting
with
alexandra
and
charity
for
some
legal
reason
that
the
lawyer
and
doctor
younger
made
clear
anne
could
not
fully
inherit
but
her
share
would
be
only
a
trifle
less
than
her
cousins
things
had
reached
this
point
when
justin
little
calmly
and
confidently
claimed
that
anne
share
was
to
be
based
upon
an
old
loan
of
father
to
his
brother
a
loan
of
three
thousand
dollars
to
float
lee
strickland
invention
with
the
understanding
that
vincent
strickland
be
subsequently
entitled
to
one
third
of
the
returns
as
the
patent
had
been
sold
for
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
one
third
of
it
with
accumulative
interest
for
ten
years
of
which
no
payment
had
ever
been
made
anne
was
a
large
proportion
of
the
entire
estate
and
the
development
of
this
claim
in
justin
little
assured
woodeny
voice
caused
everyone
except
the
indifferent
cherry
to
look
grave
the
estate
was
not
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
now
by
any
means
it
had
been
reduced
to
little
more
than
two
thirds
of
that
sum
and
anne
bright
concern
that
everyone
should
be
satisfied
with
what
was
right
and
her
ingenuous
pleasure
in
justin
cleverness
in
thinking
of
this
possibility
were
met
with
noticeable
coldness
if
anne
was
wrong
and
the
paper
she
held
in
her
hand
worthless
each
girl
would
inherit
a
comfortable
little
fortune
but
if
anne
was
right
cherry
and
alix
would
have
only
a
few
thousand
dollars
apiece
and
the
old
home
the
business
talk
was
over
before
any
of
them
realized
the
enormity
of
anne
contention
and
anne
and
justin
had
departed
but
both
the
old
doctor
and
the
lawyer
agreed
with
martin
that
it
looked
as
if
anne
was
right
and
when
the
family
was
alone
again
and
had
had
the
time
to
digest
the
matter
they
felt
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
across
their
lives
that
anne
could
do
it
alix
said
over
and
over
cherry
seemed
dazed
spoke
not
at
all
and
martin
had
said
little
people
will
do
anything
for
money
he
observed
once
drily
he
had
met
justin
sternly
i
not
thinking
of
my
wife
share
i
did
marry
her
for
her
money
never
knew
she
had
any
but
i
thinking
of
alix
yes
we
must
think
of
darling
alix
anne
had
said
nervously
eager
that
there
should
be
no
quarrel
if
uncle
lee
intended
me
to
have
all
this
money
then
i
suppose
i
must
take
it
but
i
sha
be
happy
unless
things
are
arranged
so
that
alix
shall
be
comfortable
the
worst
of
it
is
alix
cherry
stammered
suddenly
on
the
day
before
she
and
martin
were
to
return
to
red
creek
i
i
counted
on
having
enough
enough
to
live
my
own
life
alix
i
ca
i
ca
go
back
why
my
darling
alix
exclaimed
as
cherry
began
to
cry
in
her
arms
my
darling
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
oh
alix
whispered
the
little
sister
trembling
i
ca
bear
it
you
do
know
how
i
feel
you
and
dad
were
always
here
now
that
all
gone
you
going
to
rent
the
house
and
try
to
teach
singing
and
nothing
to
look
forward
to
i
nobody
listen
dear
alix
soothed
her
if
they
advise
it
and
especially
if
peter
advises
it
when
he
gets
back
we
fight
anne
and
then
if
we
win
our
fight
i
always
keep
the
valley
house
open
and
if
we
do
why
i
going
to
visit
you
and
martin
every
year
and
perhaps
i
have
a
little
apartment
some
day
i
do
intend
to
board
always
but
she
was
crying
too
everything
seemed
changed
cold
and
strange
she
had
suspected
that
cherry
was
not
a
successful
marriage
she
knew
it
now
and
to
resign
the
adored
little
sister
to
the
unsympathetic
atmosphere
of
red
creek
and
to
miss
all
the
old
life
and
the
old
associations
made
her
heart
ache
there
there
nothing
special
cherry
she
asked
after
a
while
with
martin
oh
no
cherry
answered
her
eyes
dried
and
her
packing
going
on
composedly
although
her
voice
trembled
now
and
then
no
it
just
that
i
get
bad
moods
she
said
bravely
i
was
pretty
young
to
marry
at
all
i
guess
martin
loves
you
alix
suggested
timidly
he
takes
me
for
granted
cherry
said
after
a
pause
there
seem
to
be
anything
alive
in
the
feeling
between
us
she
added
slowly
if
he
says
something
to
me
i
make
an
effort
to
get
his
point
of
view
before
i
answer
if
i
tell
him
some
plan
of
mine
i
can
see
that
he
thinks
it
sounds
crazy
i
do
seem
very
domestic
that
all
i
i
try
really
i
do
but
and
cherry
seemed
to
brace
herself
in
soul
and
body
but
that
marriage
i
try
again
she
gave
alix
a
long
kiss
in
parting
the
next
day
and
clung
to
her
you
the
dearest
sister
a
girl
ever
had
alix
you
all
i
have
now
i
write
you
about
the
case
and
wire
you
if
you
needed
and
see
you
soon
alix
said
cheerfully
then
she
turned
and
went
back
into
the
empty
house
keeping
back
her
tears
until
the
sound
of
the
surrey
had
quite
died
away
chapter
x
alexandra
strickland
coming
down
the
stairway
of
the
valley
house
on
an
april
evening
glanced
curiously
at
the
door
her
eyes
moved
to
the
old
clock
and
a
smile
tugged
involuntarily
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
only
eight
but
the
day
had
been
so
long
and
so
quiet
that
she
had
fancied
that
the
hour
was
much
later
and
had
wondered
who
knocked
so
late
she
crossed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
to
darkness
and
rain
and
to
a
man
in
a
raincoat
who
whipped
off
a
spattered
cap
and
stood
smiling
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
held
instantly
with
a
sort
of
gasp
of
surprise
and
pleasure
and
some
deeper
emotion
she
set
down
the
lamp
and
held
out
her
hands
gropingly
and
went
into
his
arms
he
laughed
joyously
as
he
kissed
her
and
for
a
minute
they
clung
together
peter
she
said
you
angel
when
did
you
arrive
and
what
are
you
doing
and
tell
me
all
about
it
but
alix
you
thin
peter
said
holding
her
at
arm
length
and
and
he
gently
touched
the
black
she
wore
and
fixed
puzzled
and
troubled
eyes
upon
her
face
alix
he
asked
apprehensively
for
answer
she
tried
to
smile
at
him
but
her
lips
trembled
and
her
eyes
brimmed
she
had
led
the
way
into
the
old
sitting
room
now
and
peter
recognized
with
a
thrill
of
real
feeling
the
shabby
rugs
and
books
and
pictures
and
the
square
piano
beside
which
he
had
watched
cherry
fat
childish
hand
on
the
scales
so
many
times
and
alix
scowling
over
her
songs
you
heard
about
dad
alix
faltered
now
turning
to
face
him
at
the
mantel
your
father
peter
said
shocked
but
had
you
heard
peter
my
dear
my
dearest
child
i
just
off
the
steamer
i
got
in
at
six
i
been
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
and
i
suddenly
decided
to
cross
the
bay
and
come
straight
on
to
the
valley
before
i
even
went
to
the
club
or
got
my
mail
tell
me
your
father
she
had
knelt
before
the
cold
hearth
and
he
knelt
beside
her
and
they
busied
themselves
with
logs
and
kindling
in
the
old
way
a
blaze
crept
up
about
the
logs
and
alix
accepted
peter
handkerchief
and
wiped
a
streak
of
soot
from
her
wrist
quite
as
if
she
was
a
child
again
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
chair
peter
took
the
doctor
chair
keeping
his
concerned
and
sympathetic
eyes
upon
her
he
was
well
one
day
she
said
simply
and
the
next
the
next
he
did
come
downstairs
and
hong
waited
and
waited
and
about
nine
i
went
up
and
he
had
fallen
he
had
fallen
she
was
in
tears
again
and
peter
put
his
hand
out
and
covered
hers
and
held
it
their
chairs
were
touching
and
as
he
leaned
forward
their
faces
might
almost
have
touched
too
he
must
have
been
going
to
call
someone
said
alix
after
a
while
they
said
he
never
suffered
at
all
this
was
january
the
last
day
and
cherry
got
here
that
same
night
he
knew
us
both
toward
morning
and
that
that
was
all
cherry
was
here
for
two
weeks
martin
came
and
went
where
is
cherry
now
peter
interrupted
back
at
red
creek
alix
wiped
her
eyes
she
hates
it
but
martin
had
a
good
position
there
poor
cherry
it
made
her
anne
came
anne
and
justin
of
course
peter
could
not
understand
expression
she
fell
silent
still
holding
his
hand
and
looking
at
the
fire
he
had
not
seen
her
for
nearly
six
months
he
had
been
all
around
the
world
had
found
her
gay
affectionate
letters
in
london
in
athens
in
yokohama
but
for
three
months
now
he
had
been
away
from
the
reach
of
mails
roughing
it
on
a
friend
hemp
plantation
in
borneo
and
if
she
had
written
the
letter
was
as
yet
undelivered
he
looked
at
her
with
a
great
rush
of
admiration
and
affection
she
was
not
only
a
pretty
and
a
clever
woman
but
in
her
plain
black
with
this
new
aspect
of
gravity
and
dignity
and
with
new
notes
of
pathos
and
appeal
in
her
exquisite
voice
he
realized
that
she
was
an
extremely
charming
woman
more
than
that
she
stood
for
home
for
the
dearly
familiar
and
beloved
things
for
which
he
had
been
so
surprisingly
homesick
his
mountain
cabin
and
the
old
house
in
san
francisco
on
pacific
avenue
she
belonged
to
his
memories
of
them
both
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
that
he
knew
well
before
he
said
to
her
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
well
remembered
her
look
of
bright
and
interested
surprise
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
forgotten
your
lady
love
of
the
and
ringlets
she
had
demanded
she
never
wore
ringlets
and
crinolines
he
had
answered
well
bustles
and
pleats
then
no
peter
had
told
her
frankly
i
shall
always
love
her
in
a
way
but
she
is
married
she
never
thinks
of
me
and
i
like
you
so
much
alix
i
like
our
music
and
cooking
and
tramps
and
reading
together
is
that
a
pretty
good
basis
for
marriage
no
alix
had
answered
decidedly
perhaps
if
i
were
madly
in
love
with
you
i
should
say
yes
and
trust
to
little
fingers
to
lead
you
gently
and
so
on
he
remembered
ending
the
conversation
in
one
of
his
quick
moods
of
irritation
against
her
if
she
could
take
anybody
or
anything
seriously
he
had
said
poor
alix
she
was
taking
life
seriously
enough
peter
thought
as
he
watched
her
tell
me
about
cherry
he
said
cherry
is
well
but
just
a
little
thin
and
now
of
course
martin
never
seems
to
stay
at
any
one
place
very
long
so
i
keep
hoping
does
make
good
peter
said
shaking
his
head
does
seem
to
it
partly
cherry
i
think
alix
said
honestly
she
was
too
young
really
she
never
quite
settles
down
or
takes
life
in
earnest
but
he
got
a
contract
now
for
three
years
and
so
she
seems
to
be
resigning
herself
and
she
has
a
maid
i
believe
she
must
love
him
peter
submitted
alix
looked
surprised
why
not
she
smiled
i
suppose
when
you
had
ups
and
downs
with
a
man
and
been
rich
and
poor
and
sick
and
well
and
have
lived
in
different
places
you
rather
take
him
for
granted
she
added
oh
you
think
it
works
that
way
peter
asked
with
a
keen
look
well
do
you
think
so
are
lots
of
marriages
like
that
you
false
alarm
you
quitter
he
answered
alix
laughed
a
trifle
guiltily
also
she
flushed
with
a
great
wave
of
splendid
young
colour
that
made
her
face
look
seventeen
again
your
father
left
you
something
alix
peter
asked
presently
with
some
hesitation
that
she
answered
frankly
is
where
anne
comes
in
anne
anne
and
justin
came
straight
over
alix
went
on
and
they
were
really
lovely
and
they
asked
me
to
come
to
them
for
a
visit
but
i
could
very
well
they
live
with
his
mother
you
know
amanda
price
little
who
writes
the
letters
to
the
chronicle
about
educating
children
and
all
that
doctor
younger
and
george
sewall
were
here
every
day
you
and
george
were
named
as
executors
i
was
so
mixed
up
in
policies
and
deeds
and
overdue
taxes
and
interest
and
bonds
poor
old
alix
if
i
had
only
been
here
to
help
you
the
man
said
and
for
a
moment
they
looked
a
little
consciously
at
each
other
well
anyway
the
girl
resumed
hastily
when
it
came
to
reading
the
will
anne
and
justin
sprung
a
mine
under
us
it
seems
that
ten
years
ago
when
the
strickland
patent
fire
extinguisher
was
put
upon
the
market
my
adorable
father
did
have
much
money
he
never
did
have
somehow
so
anne
father
my
uncle
vincent
went
into
it
with
him
to
the
extent
of
about
three
thousand
dollars
three
thousand
peter
who
had
been
leaning
forward
earnestly
attentive
echoed
in
relief
that
was
all
dad
had
about
three
hundred
they
had
to
have
a
laboratory
and
some
expensive
retorts
and
things
it
seems
dad
did
all
the
work
and
put
in
his
three
hundred
and
uncle
vincent
put
in
three
thousand
and
the
funny
thing
is
alix
broke
off
to
say
musingly
uncle
vincent
was
perfectly
splendid
about
it
i
myself
remember
him
saying
worry
lee
i
speculating
on
my
own
responsibility
not
yours
well
peter
prompted
as
she
hesitated
well
they
had
a
written
agreement
then
giving
uncle
vincent
a
third
interest
in
the
patent
should
it
be
sold
or
put
on
the
market
ha
peter
ejaculated
struck
which
of
course
was
only
a
little
while
before
uncle
vincent
died
alix
went
on
with
a
grave
nod
the
agreement
lay
in
dad
desk
all
these
years
fancy
how
easily
he
might
have
burned
it
many
the
time
but
he
did
george
sewall
says
that
anne
is
right
but
was
anne
third
heiress
anyway
under
his
will
i
know
heard
certainly
she
was
but
a
third
interest
now
in
a
diminished
estate
that
began
at
something
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
is
quite
different
from
a
third
of
it
ten
years
ago
plus
compound
interest
alix
said
bringing
her
clear
brows
together
with
a
quizzical
smile
they
broken
the
will
peter
in
the
silence
whistled
expressively
gee
rusalem
he
exclaimed
what
does
it
come
to
at
this
alix
looked
very
sober
gazed
down
at
the
fire
and
shook
her
head
all
he
had
she
answered
briefly
peter
was
silent
looking
at
her
in
stupefaction
almost
that
is
alix
amended
more
cheerfully
as
it
was
we
should
have
had
more
than
thirty
thousand
apiece
as
it
is
anne
gets
it
all
or
if
not
quite
all
nearly
all
gets
he
echoed
hotly
how
do
you
mean
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
just
the
girl
answered
rather
lifelessly
but
immediately
she
laughed
do
look
so
awful
peter
in
the
first
place
cherry
and
i
still
have
the
house
in
the
second
place
i
am
singing
at
raphael
for
five
hundred
a
year
and
singing
other
places
now
and
then
alix
are
you
corking
he
said
with
his
pleasantest
smile
am
i
she
asked
smiling
but
immediately
the
smile
melted
and
her
lips
shook
anyway
i
glad
you
home
again
peter
she
added
home
again
he
answered
i
should
hope
i
am
and
high
time
too
has
this
this
money
been
turned
over
to
anne
not
yet
nobody
gets
anything
until
the
estate
is
cleared
a
year
or
more
from
now
and
do
you
tell
me
that
she
will
have
the
effrontery
to
take
it
rather
she
said
to
me
it
wonderful
that
justin
saw
it
at
once
and
i
never
would
have
seen
it
she
was
quite
sweet
and
merry
over
it
great
lord
does
she
know
that
it
practically
all
your
father
had
alix
hesitated
well
you
see
there
had
been
mismanagement
peter
dad
speculated
and
lost
some
and
we
were
a
pretty
heavy
expense
for
a
good
many
years
i
hated
to
expose
the
whole
thing
and
george
he
been
splendid
said
that
they
probably
had
a
perfectly
valid
claim
anyway
there
are
some
things
to
be
thankful
for
alix
added
dashing
the
sudden
tears
from
her
eyes
and
one
is
that
dad
never
knew
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
surprised
i
am
at
anne
peter
said
well
we
all
were
alix
confessed
but
it
just
anne
odd
little
way
she
added
it
was
here
and
she
wanted
it
she
belongs
heart
and
soul
to
the
little
family
now
and
she
is
quite
triumphant
over
being
of
so
much
help
to
justin
they
to
build
a
house
in
berkeley
anne
has
it
all
worked
out
alix
said
with
amused
distaste
well
i
let
hong
go
and
as
soon
as
i
can
rent
this
house
i
going
to
new
york
why
new
york
my
dear
girl
because
i
believe
i
can
make
a
living
there
singing
and
teaching
and
generally
struggling
with
life
she
answered
cheerfully
cherry
gets
most
of
the
money
they
are
always
somewhat
in
debt
and
i
imagine
that
the
reason
she
is
able
to
have
a
nice
apartment
and
a
maid
now
is
because
she
knows
it
is
coming
and
i
get
the
house
and
enough
money
to
keep
me
going
say
a
year
in
new
york
do
you
want
to
go
alix
he
said
affectionately
yes
i
think
i
do
she
answered
but
her
eyes
watered
i
do
in
a
way
she
added
that
is
i
love
my
singing
and
the
thought
of
making
a
success
is
delightful
to
me
but
of
course
it
means
that
i
give
up
everything
else
i
ca
have
home
life
and
and
the
valley
for
years
four
or
five
anyway
i
have
to
give
all
that
up
and
peter
and
i
always
rather
hoped
that
my
music
was
going
to
be
a
domestic
variety
she
stopped
smiling
but
he
saw
the
pain
in
her
eyes
george
sewall
most
kindly
asked
me
to
mother
his
small
son
she
resumed
casually
but
although
he
is
the
dearest
sewall
did
peter
exclaimed
rather
struck
great
scott
his
father
is
one
of
the
richest
men
in
san
francisco
i
know
it
alix
agreed
and
he
is
one
of
the
nicest
men
she
added
but
of
course
he
never
really
love
any
one
but
ursula
and
i
felt
oh
i
felt
too
tired
and
alone
and
depressed
to
enter
upon
congratulations
and
clothes
and
family
dinners
with
the
sewalls
she
ended
a
little
drearily
i
wanted
i
wanted
things
in
the
old
way
as
they
were
she
said
her
voice
thickening
i
know
i
know
peter
said
sympathetically
and
for
a
while
there
was
silence
in
the
little
house
while
the
rain
fell
steadily
upon
the
dark
forest
without
and
soaked
branches
swished
about
eaves
and
windows
can
you
put
me
up
he
asked
suddenly
he
liked
her
frank
pleasure
rather
i
think
cherry
room
was
made
up
fresh
last
monday
she
told
him
and
she
added
with
a
brightening
face
we
walk
up
to
your
house
and
see
what
six
months
of
kow
uninterrupted
sway
have
done
to
it
that
just
what
we
do
he
agreed
enthusiastically
and
have
some
music
she
had
risen
as
if
for
and
was
now
beside
the
old
square
piano
where
she
had
placed
the
lamp
i
have
touched
it
since
she
said
sadly
sitting
on
the
stool
and
with
her
eyes
still
smiling
on
him
putting
back
the
hinged
cover
and
a
moment
later
her
hands
with
the
assurance
and
ease
of
the
adept
drifted
into
one
of
the
songs
of
the
old
days
do
you
remember
the
day
we
put
the
rose
tree
back
peter
she
asked
when
martin
was
almost
a
stranger
and
do
you
remember
the
day
cherry
and
i
fell
into
the
three
wells
and
you
and
dad
had
to
disappear
while
we
dried
our
clothing
on
branches
of
trees
and
do
you
remember
the
day
we
made
biscuits
over
by
the
ocean
i
remember
all
the
days
he
answered
deeply
stirred
we
did
see
all
this
then
alix
mused
still
playing
softly
anne
claiming
everything
for
her
husband
you
and
i
here
talking
of
death
and
cherry
married
she
sighed
she
not
happy
he
questioned
quickly
alix
shrugged
pursing
her
lips
doubtfully
she
not
unhappy
she
told
him
with
a
troubled
smile
it
just
one
of
those
marriages
that
do
ever
get
anywhere
and
do
ever
stop
she
added
martin
has
faults
he
unreasonable
and
he
makes
enemies
but
those
are
the
faults
for
which
a
woman
can
leave
her
husband
oh
peter
she
added
laying
a
smooth
warm
hand
on
his
and
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
with
her
honest
eyes
do
go
away
again
stay
here
in
the
valley
for
a
week
or
two
and
help
me
get
everything
worked
out
and
thought
out
i
been
so
much
alone
dear
old
alix
he
said
sitting
down
on
the
bench
beside
her
and
putting
his
arm
about
her
she
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
so
they
sat
very
still
for
a
long
minute
alix
hand
went
to
her
own
shoulder
and
her
fingers
tightened
on
his
and
she
breathed
deep
contented
breaths
like
a
child
somebody
ought
to
wire
grundy
collect
she
said
after
awhile
we
will
defy
grundy
my
dear
peter
said
kissing
the
top
of
a
soft
brown
braid
by
trotting
off
hand
in
hand
tomorrow
and
getting
ourselves
married
why
alix
he
gave
us
his
consent
years
ago
you
remember
he
did
wish
it
she
said
and
burst
into
tears
i
seem
to
be
doing
things
in
a
slightly
irregular
manner
she
said
to
him
the
next
day
when
they
had
gotten
breakfast
together
and
were
basking
in
the
sunlight
of
the
upper
deck
of
the
ferryboat
on
their
way
to
the
city
i
spend
the
night
before
my
marriage
alone
alone
in
a
small
country
house
hidden
in
the
woods
with
my
betrothed
and
propose
to
buy
my
trousseau
immediately
after
the
ceremony
i
feel
like
saying
to
you
what
the
dear
old
french
archbishop
said
to
the
small
child
peter
smiled
marvelling
a
little
nonetheless
at
her
untouched
serenity
he
was
speaking
to
all
the
children
in
some
institution
and
came
to
this
little
one
tu
etes
negre
ah
bien
bien
continuez
continuez
it
what
makes
you
yourself
alix
doing
everything
just
a
little
differently
marrying
you
far
from
seeming
a
radical
or
momentous
thing
to
do
she
assured
him
seems
to
me
like
getting
back
into
key
getting
out
of
this
bad
dream
of
loneliness
and
change
securing
something
that
i
thought
was
lost
her
voice
fell
to
a
dreamy
note
and
she
watched
the
gulls
wheeling
in
the
sunshine
with
thoughtful
smiling
eyes
the
man
glanced
at
her
once
or
twice
in
the
silence
that
followed
with
something
like
hesitation
or
compunction
in
his
look
look
here
alix
let
talk
i
want
to
ask
you
something
or
rather
i
want
to
tell
you
something
or
rather
continuez
continuez
she
said
laughing
as
he
hesitated
there
never
been
anything
anything
to
tell
you
or
your
father
if
he
was
here
peter
said
flushed
and
a
trifle
awkward
i
not
that
kind
of
a
man
i
was
a
crippled
kid
as
you
know
all
for
books
and
music
and
walks
and
older
people
but
there
has
been
that
one
thing
that
one
woman
flushed
too
she
was
looking
at
him
with
bright
intelligent
eyes
but
i
thought
she
never
even
knew
no
she
never
did
alix
looked
back
at
the
gulls
oh
well
then
she
said
indifferently
alix
would
you
like
to
know
about
her
peter
said
bravely
her
name
and
everything
oh
no
please
i
much
rather
not
she
intercepted
him
hastily
and
after
a
pause
she
added
our
marriage
is
the
usual
marriage
in
that
way
i
mean
i
not
jealous
and
i
not
going
to
cry
my
eyes
out
because
there
was
another
woman
is
another
woman
who
meant
more
to
you
or
might
have
i
going
into
it
with
my
eyes
wide
open
peter
i
know
you
love
me
and
i
love
you
and
we
both
like
the
same
things
and
that
enough
three
weeks
later
he
remembered
the
moment
and
asked
her
again
they
were
in
the
valley
house
now
and
a
bitter
storm
was
whirling
over
the
mountain
peter
little
cabin
rocked
to
the
gale
but
they
were
warm
and
comfortable
beside
the
fire
the
room
was
scented
by
alix
sweet
single
violets
white
and
purple
spilling
themselves
from
a
glass
bowl
and
by
peter
pipe
and
by
the
good
scent
of
green
bay
burning
the
joyces
had
had
a
happy
day
had
climbed
the
hills
under
a
lowering
sky
had
come
home
to
dry
clothes
and
to
cooking
for
kow
was
away
and
had
finally
shared
an
epicurean
meal
beside
the
fire
peter
was
wrapped
in
deep
content
the
companionship
of
this
normal
pretty
woman
her
quick
words
and
quick
laugh
her
music
her
glancing
bright
interest
in
anything
and
everything
was
the
richest
experience
of
his
life
she
had
said
that
she
would
change
nothing
in
his
home
but
her
clever
white
fingers
had
changed
everything
there
was
order
now
there
was
charming
fussing
and
dusting
there
were
flowers
in
bowls
and
books
set
straight
and
there
was
just
the
different
little
angle
to
piano
and
desk
and
chairs
and
tables
that
made
the
cabin
a
home
at
last
she
wanted
bricks
for
a
path
he
had
laughed
at
her
fervent
do
give
me
a
whole
carload
of
bricks
for
christmas
peter
she
wanted
bulbs
to
pot
he
had
lazily
suggested
that
they
open
the
town
house
while
carpenters
and
painters
remade
the
cabin
but
she
had
protested
hotly
oh
do
let
keep
it
just
as
it
always
was
smiling
he
gave
her
her
way
she
amused
him
day
after
day
he
watched
her
marvelling
at
the
miracle
that
was
woman
he
heard
her
in
the
kitchen
interrogating
the
chinese
you
show
me
picture
your
little
boy
he
heard
her
inveigling
antone
the
old
italian
labourer
into
confidences
tonight
he
watched
her
in
great
satisfaction
he
liked
to
have
her
here
in
his
home
one
of
the
pretty
stricklands
peter
joyce
wife
nobody
else
was
here
nobody
else
belonged
here
they
were
masters
of
their
own
lives
she
quite
captivated
him
by
her
simplicity
and
frankness
she
washed
her
masses
of
brown
hair
and
shook
it
loose
in
the
sunshine
and
she
came
in
wet
more
than
once
and
changed
her
shoes
before
the
fire
just
as
she
had
years
ago
when
she
was
a
madcap
little
girl
running
wild
through
the
woods
they
had
been
talking
of
cherry
as
they
often
did
alix
favourite
topic
was
her
little
sister
she
had
almost
a
maternal
pride
and
fondness
where
cherry
was
concerned
today
she
had
been
and
had
brought
some
treasures
downstairs
she
had
showed
peter
cherry
old
exercise
books
look
peter
how
she
put
faces
in
the
naughts
and
turned
the
sevens
into
little
and
see
the
straggling
letters
strickland
i
always
hated
to
destroy
them
she
was
such
a
lazy
cunning
little
scholar
peter
smiling
at
the
old
books
had
remembered
her
a
small
square
cherry
with
a
film
of
gold
falling
over
a
blazing
cheek
and
mutinous
blue
eyes
ah
the
wonderful
eyes
were
wonderful
even
then
the
date
gave
him
a
moment
shock
only
eight
only
seven
years
ago
she
had
been
a
schoolgirl
cherry
was
not
yet
i
wish
she
had
married
a
little
differently
alix
said
thoughtfully
cherry
is
exacting
but
she
does
like
pretty
gowns
and
pretty
rooms
and
to
do
things
as
other
girls
do
you
should
have
married
the
mining
engineer
he
told
her
red
creek
would
have
had
no
terrors
for
you
i
should
have
loved
it
she
agreed
carelessly
a
curious
expression
flashed
into
her
face
she
was
smiling
but
immediately
the
smile
faded
and
she
looked
back
at
the
fire
with
puzzled
eyes
if
i
loved
a
man
peter
the
place
and
the
house
and
the
money
would
matter
much
she
answered
after
awhile
in
a
slightly
strained
voice
perhaps
he
suggested
still
thinking
of
cherry
that
the
trouble
she
gave
him
a
quick
almost
frightened
look
the
the
trouble
she
stammered
and
with
a
little
ashamed
laugh
she
added
what
trouble
for
a
long
time
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
at
first
puzzled
gradually
fitting
meaning
and
interpretation
to
his
words
and
her
own
presently
their
eyes
met
and
with
her
little
gruff
boyish
laugh
she
came
over
to
the
low
seat
at
his
knee
you
see
that
there
is
something
just
a
little
wrong
then
she
asked
between
you
and
me
alix
he
questioned
in
return
his
fine
hand
tight
upon
hers
and
his
affectionate
brotherly
look
searching
her
face
well
do
you
peter
she
countered
i
had
noticed
anything
my
dear
except
that
you
are
making
a
lonely
solitary
man
a
very
happy
one
he
answered
with
his
grave
smile
but
that
she
contended
with
scarlet
cheeks
but
bravely
that
is
marriage
what
ought
marriage
be
he
smiled
half
humouring
her
half
concerned
for
answer
she
looked
keenly
almost
wistfully
into
his
face
he
had
noticed
this
look
more
than
once
of
late
i
do
know
she
said
softly
after
awhile
with
a
little
discouraged
shrug
of
her
shoulders
i
always
thought
that
when
a
man
and
a
woman
liked
each
other
oh
thoroughly
liked
the
same
things
had
everything
in
common
that
that
was
enough
and
for
the
woman
i
was
a
month
ago
it
would
have
been
enough
peter
she
added
in
a
puzzled
tone
you
changed
then
mrs
joyce
that
it
she
agreed
i
not
the
same
woman
i
could
as
a
girl
estimate
what
life
was
going
to
be
as
a
wife
perhaps
no
girl
can
he
suggested
interested
now
well
that
just
what
i
thinking
peter
she
smiled
a
little
ruefully
and
again
she
gave
him
the
look
that
was
new
that
was
not
all
timid
nor
wistful
nor
appealing
yet
somehow
partook
of
all
three
you
see
you
feel
that
nothing
can
change
you
she
elucidated
further
and
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
yourself
from
your
old
standpoint
and
then
the
well
the
mental
and
spiritual
and
physical
miracle
of
marriage
does
change
you
and
it
is
as
if
you
had
entered
into
a
contract
for
a
totally
strange
woman
she
was
so
intent
so
bright
and
earnest
as
she
turned
a
face
to
his
that
he
felt
an
odd
moisture
pricking
his
eyes
alix
he
said
affectionately
where
do
i
fail
you
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
her
bright
eyes
fixed
on
his
gradually
the
serious
look
on
her
face
lightened
and
her
customary
smile
twitched
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
i
married
you
under
a
misapprehension
she
said
i
thought
you
had
about
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
it
appears
that
you
have
more
than
that
every
month
every
week
for
all
i
know
you
knew
my
mother
had
that
old
pacific
avenue
place
he
answered
with
concern
i
never
for
one
second
deceived
oh
you
idiot
alix
laughed
i
do
mind
being
rich
at
all
i
like
it
i
do
want
to
live
in
the
city
or
join
women
clubs
and
all
that
but
i
like
having
my
own
truly
i
do
as
for
all
the
silver
and
portraits
and
rugs
and
things
why
we
may
like
them
some
day
he
was
not
listening
to
her
there
was
a
sorry
look
in
his
eyes
you
know
alix
he
said
suddenly
you
made
life
a
different
thing
to
me
i
never
had
any
woman
near
me
before
and
to
hear
your
voice
about
the
house
and
your
piano
and
your
laugh
why
wonderful
to
me
i
been
alone
here
so
many
years
not
knowing
really
how
much
of
life
i
missed
and
you
brought
it
all
to
me
why
even
to
have
florence
at
the
post
office
ask
me
for
joyce
gives
me
a
warm
happy
sort
of
feeling
i
he
stroked
the
smooth
hand
under
his
own
there
was
real
emotion
in
his
voice
i
do
a
good
deal
to
show
you
how
grateful
i
am
old
girl
he
finished
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
where
i
fail
and
i
move
heaven
and
earth
to
please
you
the
point
is
alix
said
with
her
mischievous
smile
as
she
twisted
the
heavy
ring
he
wore
do
i
fail
you
i
know
i
do
flush
with
delight
when
you
give
me
a
smile
and
tremble
with
fear
at
your
frown
i
know
that
the
smell
of
my
hair
does
make
you
turn
pale
and
the
touch
of
my
hand
make
you
dizzy
there
no
fury
fire
and
madness
she
laughed
and
he
laughed
too
a
little
reproachfully
you
never
will
be
serious
for
more
than
two
minutes
alexandra
my
child
he
said
alix
did
not
answer
she
sat
staring
at
the
fire
for
another
minute
or
two
and
her
eyes
brightened
childishly
had
he
but
seen
them
but
she
did
not
give
another
look
at
him
with
a
great
fling
of
her
arms
she
rested
her
head
between
two
elbows
for
a
second
tousled
her
hair
and
yawned
i
going
to
bed
she
announced
i
so
glad
i
married
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
banking
the
fire
and
opening
windows
and
putting
out
lamps
every
night
you
she
had
reached
the
door
of
their
room
now
and
already
the
silky
braids
were
freed
and
tumbled
about
her
shoulders
you
spoil
me
pete
she
said
between
them
our
marriage
may
be
different
but
it
has
its
good
points
sure
you
happy
he
smiled
the
familiar
little
answer
came
confidently
he
heard
her
humming
as
she
undressed
in
a
shaft
of
moonlight
she
was
never
serious
long
one
may
day
they
were
picnicking
in
the
big
forest
it
was
a
day
of
spongy
dampness
underfoot
sweet
and
wild
with
breezes
blue
of
sky
and
still
cold
in
the
shade
if
it
was
heavenly
warm
in
the
sun
alix
who
was
hot
and
panting
from
the
scrambling
and
slipping
downhill
hung
on
a
bank
with
her
arm
crooked
about
a
sapling
oak
for
support
her
hat
slipped
back
and
hanging
childishly
about
her
neck
and
her
already
brief
tramping
skirt
displaying
an
even
unusual
amount
of
sensibly
booted
leg
below
her
peter
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
was
gathering
firewood
shafts
of
sunlight
filtered
through
the
arches
of
the
redwoods
high
above
the
creek
and
fell
here
and
there
upon
the
busy
currents
of
the
water
presently
sunshine
turned
the
flames
of
the
brush
fire
to
pink
a
dense
column
of
white
smoke
rose
fragrantly
between
the
furry
trunks
they
had
been
talking
doubtfully
of
the
recent
developments
of
what
justin
and
anne
little
called
with
relish
the
strickland
will
case
peter
who
had
for
several
weeks
been
investigating
the
matter
with
a
deepening
conviction
that
it
was
a
deuced
awkward
affair
had
smiled
a
most
pleasant
smile
as
alix
enlarged
upon
the
delight
of
giving
the
whole
fortune
should
they
get
it
to
cherry
for
cherry
she
said
still
hanging
on
her
bank
is
like
most
married
women
she
hates
and
economy
dad
always
made
life
too
easy
for
us
you
know
it
was
even
as
if
she
had
had
my
example
before
her
she
really
knew
nothing
of
domestic
responsibility
but
what
about
you
peter
asked
smiling
you
seem
to
take
kindly
enough
to
matrimony
my
case
is
different
alix
said
unembarrassed
getting
down
to
come
stand
beside
him
at
the
fire
i
married
an
old
man
for
his
money
do
you
know
he
said
putting
his
arm
about
her
i
like
you
no
sooner
get
hold
of
your
money
if
you
do
than
you
want
to
turn
it
all
over
to
cherry
you
a
devoted
sister
do
you
know
it
i
a
devoted
wife
she
answered
with
an
upward
glance
but
a
second
later
her
mood
changed
she
was
off
to
try
the
experiment
of
crossing
the
stream
upon
the
treacherous
surface
of
a
fallen
tree
he
watched
her
her
cautiously
advancing
foot
her
hand
tightly
grasping
an
upright
branch
her
eyes
flitting
from
the
water
below
to
the
rough
bridge
before
her
she
was
completely
absorbed
you
ca
do
it
peter
called
annoyed
at
the
senseless
risk
she
took
when
she
placed
her
foot
tentatively
upon
the
curved
side
of
a
log
there
no
foothold
there
come
save
me
she
shrieked
in
the
old
way
with
the
old
laugh
of
terror
and
delight
he
jumped
to
her
rescue
clearing
the
creek
in
a
shallow
place
with
two
splashing
bounds
and
catching
her
before
her
laughing
cry
had
fully
died
away
in
the
silent
arches
of
the
forest
you
maniac
he
scolded
as
warm
tumbled
and
penitent
she
half
slipped
and
half
yielded
herself
to
his
hold
come
over
here
now
and
sit
down
and
unpack
the
eats
i
ca
have
my
wife
drowned
before
my
eyes
the
title
brought
a
sudden
flood
of
colour
to
her
face
she
meekly
seated
herself
beside
him
on
a
great
log
and
he
locked
his
arm
about
her
they
sat
so
long
in
the
wet
sweet
forest
hands
clasped
that
nesting
birds
flew
boldly
about
them
unafraid
and
two
wildcats
trotting
softly
in
single
file
green
eyes
blinking
passed
within
a
few
inches
of
them
unseeing
this
said
peter
after
awhile
is
pleasant
he
thought
she
did
not
answer
except
by
a
faint
tightening
of
her
fingers
but
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
said
this
is
marriage
chapter
xi
cherry
had
a
flat
now
in
red
creek
park
it
differed
from
an
apartment
because
it
had
no
elevator
no
janitor
no
steam
heat
these
things
were
neither
known
nor
needed
in
the
crude
mining
town
the
flat
building
itself
was
considered
a
rather
questionable
innovation
it
was
a
wooden
building
three
stories
high
with
bay
windows
there
were
empty
lots
each
side
of
it
but
the
sidewalls
were
on
property
boundaries
and
had
windows
only
where
the
building
jutted
in
and
there
was
a
small
gate
and
a
narrow
cement
walk
pressing
tightly
on
one
side
cherry
had
watched
this
building
going
up
and
had
thought
it
everything
desirable
she
liked
the
clean
kitchen
all
fresh
white
woodwork
tiles
and
nickelplate
and
she
liked
the
big
closets
and
the
she
had
worried
herself
almost
sick
with
fear
that
she
would
not
get
this
wonderful
place
and
finally
paid
dollars
for
the
first
month
rent
with
a
heart
she
had
the
centre
floor
from
her
windows
she
looked
down
at
the
park
all
the
other
buildings
were
wooden
bungalows
in
many
places
the
sidewalks
were
wooden
too
and
the
centre
of
the
street
was
deep
black
dust
in
summer
and
churned
black
mud
in
the
winter
the
little
houses
gushed
electric
light
which
was
cheap
the
street
itself
was
unlighted
but
after
the
excitement
of
moving
in
died
away
she
hated
the
place
she
had
enough
money
to
hire
a
maid
now
and
she
had
a
succession
of
slatternly
independent
young
women
in
her
kitchen
but
she
found
her
freedom
strangely
flat
she
detested
the
women
of
red
creek
cherry
went
to
market
to
buy
prunes
and
lard
and
apples
and
matches
again
but
this
took
little
time
and
otherwise
she
had
nothing
to
do
now
and
then
a
play
straight
from
a
triumphant
year
on
broadway
came
to
town
for
one
night
then
martin
took
his
wife
and
they
bowed
to
half
the
men
and
women
in
the
house
lamenting
as
they
streamed
out
into
the
sharp
night
air
that
red
creek
did
not
see
more
such
productions
the
effect
of
these
plays
was
to
make
cherry
long
vaguely
for
the
stage
she
really
did
not
enjoy
them
for
themselves
but
they
helped
her
to
visualize
eastern
cities
lighted
streets
restaurants
full
of
lights
and
music
beautiful
women
fitly
gowned
after
one
of
these
performances
she
would
not
leave
her
flat
for
several
days
but
would
sit
dreaming
over
the
thought
of
herself
in
the
heroine
role
one
day
she
had
a
letter
from
alix
it
gave
her
a
heartache
she
hardly
knew
why
she
began
to
dream
of
her
own
home
of
the
warm
sweet
little
valley
whose
breezes
were
like
wine
of
tamalpais
wreathed
in
fog
and
of
the
ridges
where
buttercups
and
poppies
powdered
a
child
shoes
with
gold
and
silver
dust
alix
had
been
ill
and
she
and
peter
had
been
away
a
few
brief
weeks
to
honolulu
and
return
cherry
crushed
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
knew
suddenly
that
she
had
always
been
jealous
of
alix
alix
wrote
gaily
that
she
had
asked
peter
if
he
did
not
want
to
send
cherry
a
kiss
and
he
had
said
that
his
face
was
too
dirty
he
was
moving
geraniums
and
for
all
that
day
whenever
cherry
thought
of
peter
it
was
with
his
hands
and
even
his
face
spattered
with
the
dark
earth
of
the
mountain
garden
the
thought
gave
her
a
genuine
thrill
and
the
next
day
she
deliberately
thought
of
him
again
but
the
thrill
was
not
so
keen
and
gradually
she
forgot
him
but
the
letter
stayed
in
her
thoughts
and
she
began
to
hunger
for
home
nothing
that
red
creek
could
offer
shook
her
yearning
for
the
remembered
sweetness
and
beauty
of
the
redwoods
and
the
great
shade
of
the
mountain
she
wanted
to
spend
a
whole
summer
with
alix
she
was
athirst
for
home
for
old
scenes
and
old
friends
and
old
emotions
she
had
only
to
hint
to
alix
to
receive
a
love
letter
containing
a
fervent
invitation
so
it
was
settled
with
a
sort
of
feverish
brevity
cherry
completed
her
arrangements
martin
was
to
use
his
own
judgment
in
the
matter
of
boarding
or
keeping
the
flat
some
of
their
household
goods
were
stored
cherry
told
him
that
she
would
come
down
in
september
and
manage
all
the
details
of
settling
afresh
but
she
knew
that
her
secret
hope
was
that
she
might
never
see
red
creek
again
it
was
all
quickly
arranged
perhaps
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
her
go
although
he
kissed
her
affectionately
and
wandered
away
from
the
station
in
a
rather
lonely
frame
of
mind
when
she
was
gone
a
friend
of
his
had
asked
him
to
dine
that
same
evening
with
a
couple
of
queens
martin
had
realized
long
ago
as
cherry
did
that
their
marriage
was
not
an
entirely
successful
one
but
he
still
considered
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
known
and
had
never
desired
any
other
but
he
thought
he
would
telephone
king
and
perhaps
dine
with
him
the
girls
might
be
amusing
anyway
cherry
was
happy
and
was
having
her
own
way
and
he
had
three
months
in
which
to
try
having
his
own
again
alix
met
her
sister
at
the
ferry
in
san
francisco
on
a
soft
may
morning
she
was
an
oddly
developed
alix
trim
and
tall
prettily
gowned
and
veiled
laughing
and
crying
with
joy
at
seeing
cherry
again
peter
she
explained
between
kisses
had
had
to
go
to
los
angeles
three
days
ago
had
been
expected
home
last
night
and
was
not
even
aware
yet
that
cherry
was
definitely
arriving
of
course
he
knew
that
you
were
coming
but
not
exactly
when
alix
said
as
she
guided
the
newcomer
along
the
familiar
ferry
place
on
to
the
big
bay
steamer
for
mill
valley
cherry
drew
back
to
exclaim
to
marvel
to
exult
at
all
the
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
oh
alix
market
street
she
exclaimed
and
that
smell
of
leather
tanning
and
that
smell
of
bay
water
and
of
coffee
and
look
that
a
we
come
over
to
san
francisco
soon
and
you
see
the
new
hotels
alix
promised
when
they
were
seated
on
the
upper
deck
with
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
moving
softly
past
them
cherry
happy
eyes
followed
a
wheeling
gull
she
felt
as
if
the
world
was
suddenly
sunshiny
and
simple
and
glorious
again
but
now
i
thought
the
best
thing
was
to
get
you
home
alix
went
on
and
get
you
rested
oh
sis
that
what
i
want
cherry
answered
her
lip
trembled
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
you
do
know
how
homesick
i
been
she
said
feeling
it
more
and
more
every
minute
i
feel
as
if
i
never
really
drawn
a
full
breath
since
i
went
away
i
ca
live
in
cities
alix
said
simply
peter
has
a
house
you
know
in
the
city
she
added
nodding
toward
the
hilly
silhouette
of
san
francisco
as
the
boat
ploughed
steadily
past
it
we
were
there
one
winter
and
in
a
way
it
was
pleasant
it
was
easier
too
but
more
than
a
year
ago
we
came
back
to
the
valley
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
want
to
leave
it
again
i
ca
get
used
to
the
idea
of
you
and
peter
married
cherry
smiled
we
well
used
to
it
alix
declared
smiling
too
but
a
little
sigh
stabbed
through
the
smile
a
second
later
cherry
exquisite
eyes
grew
sympathetic
she
suspected
from
the
letter
alix
had
written
that
there
would
be
no
nursery
needed
in
the
mountain
cabin
for
awhile
and
she
knew
that
to
alix
this
would
be
a
bitter
cross
well
you
see
i
not
seen
you
since
the
month
daddy
died
cherry
reminded
her
they
fell
to
talking
of
their
father
drifted
to
anne
and
anne
limitations
and
complacencies
and
is
it
funny
to
you
to
be
a
rich
man
wife
cherry
pursued
peter
not
rich
alix
answered
laughing
we
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
and
if
i
had
ambitions
about
rugs
and
linen
and
furs
i
could
have
them
but
unfortunately
neither
one
of
us
is
interested
in
those
things
i
get
a
few
new
songs
peter
gets
a
few
new
books
we
both
get
a
catalogue
and
pick
out
plants
and
that
about
the
extent
of
our
dissipation
the
things
i
want
alix
finished
ca
be
bought
for
money
i
know
cherry
said
a
warm
little
hand
quickly
touching
her
sister
but
to
have
you
here
cherry
dearest
alix
said
joyfully
and
to
think
of
what
it
means
to
us
both
my
dear
the
walks
and
talks
and
fires
and
music
and
dinners
and
duets
cherry
said
with
her
old
fresh
laugh
do
forget
canta
rio
sul
tuo
liuto
and
wert
thou
in
the
cauld
cauld
blast
oh
cherry
how
utterly
delicious
it
is
alix
said
gathering
wraps
and
bags
for
the
change
from
the
boat
to
the
train
that
would
land
them
in
twenty
minutes
at
the
little
station
in
mill
valley
sausalito
fragrant
with
acacia
and
rose
blooms
rose
steeply
into
the
bright
sunshine
beyond
the
marshes
skirting
the
bay
glittering
in
light
cherry
eager
eyes
missed
nothing
and
when
they
left
the
train
at
mill
valley
and
the
mountain
air
enveloped
them
in
a
rush
of
its
clear
softness
and
purity
she
was
in
ecstasies
she
welcomed
the
waiting
red
setter
as
a
beloved
friend
and
leaned
from
the
shabby
motor
car
delighted
at
every
landmark
alix
the
post
office
and
the
blacksmith
and
how
the
hill
has
been
built
up
each
side
of
the
steps
and
is
that
the
kelley
and
the
but
look
at
the
size
of
the
trees
they
came
to
the
woods
by
the
skeleton
of
the
old
spanish
mill
and
she
fell
silent
and
the
blue
eyes
that
penetrated
the
layers
upon
layers
of
soft
greenness
over
her
head
brimmed
with
happy
tears
the
sweet
breath
of
the
forest
fell
like
a
cool
hand
upon
her
tired
forehead
her
heart
began
to
dance
in
the
old
irresponsible
way
presently
straight
ahead
and
rising
sharply
over
them
was
the
mountain
clear
even
soft
and
kindly
in
the
flood
of
early
summer
sunshine
it
was
cool
in
the
woods
even
though
warm
light
was
pushing
its
way
through
the
redwoods
here
and
there
but
when
they
emerged
from
the
trees
and
took
the
winding
dirt
road
that
rose
to
the
hilltop
suddenly
the
day
seemed
hot
alix
driving
threw
off
her
coat
and
cherry
felt
the
moisture
prick
her
forehead
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
when
they
reached
the
cabin
it
was
a
picture
of
peaceful
beauty
in
the
summer
noon
there
were
still
buttercups
and
poppies
in
the
fields
and
in
the
garden
thousands
of
roses
were
growing
riotously
flinging
their
long
arms
up
against
the
slope
of
the
low
brown
roof
and
hanging
in
festoons
from
the
low
branches
of
the
oaks
beyond
the
house
the
mountain
rose
from
the
porch
cherry
could
look
down
upon
the
familiar
valley
and
the
rivers
winding
like
strips
of
blue
ribbon
through
the
marshes
and
the
far
bay
and
san
francisco
beyond
inside
were
shady
rooms
bowls
of
flowers
plain
little
white
curtains
stirring
in
the
summer
breeze
peace
and
simplicity
everywhere
cherry
smiled
at
the
immaculately
clad
chinese
stirring
something
in
a
yellow
bowl
in
a
spotless
kitchen
whose
windows
showed
manzanita
and
wild
lilac
and
madrone
trees
smiled
at
the
big
smoked
fireplace
where
sunlight
fell
straight
on
piled
logs
down
the
chimney
great
mouth
smiled
as
she
went
to
and
fro
on
journeys
of
investigation
but
the
smile
quivered
into
tears
when
she
came
to
her
own
room
just
such
a
room
as
little
charity
strickland
had
had
only
a
few
years
ago
with
white
hangings
and
unpainted
wood
fresh
air
streaming
through
it
and
redwoods
outside
oh
alix
i
never
missed
dad
before
but
to
have
him
out
there
fussing
at
something
under
the
trees
to
have
him
call
us
are
the
girls
i
want
a
girl
i
know
alix
own
eyes
filled
she
sat
on
cherry
bed
while
the
younger
woman
changed
her
dusty
travelling
clothes
for
a
worn
but
beautiful
linen
gown
and
they
said
that
they
would
go
soon
to
the
little
sausalito
cemetery
and
see
that
dad
favourite
heliotrope
was
flourishing
the
exquisite
day
went
its
peaceful
course
cherry
was
too
tired
for
walking
except
on
a
laughing
when
alix
showed
her
every
separate
bush
and
tree
with
pride
for
the
most
part
she
lay
in
a
deep
porch
chair
drinking
in
the
beauty
and
serenity
of
the
june
afternoon
breathing
above
the
sweet
garden
odours
of
lilac
and
verbena
and
mignonette
the
piney
fragrance
of
the
forest
alix
coming
and
going
watched
her
affectionately
the
little
languid
arm
in
its
transparent
sleeve
the
drooping
beautiful
head
the
slender
crossed
ankles
were
always
a
picture
you
are
like
a
boat
just
reaching
harbour
alix
said
sympathetically
sails
furled
anchor
down
just
resting
i
feel
like
one
cherry
answered
lifting
lazy
blue
eyes
a
month
of
this
will
make
me
over
a
month
the
older
sister
echoed
indignantly
disappearing
kitchenward
on
some
errand
presently
the
supper
table
was
laid
at
cherry
side
bees
shot
like
bullets
through
the
garden
birds
settled
for
the
night
supper
was
ready
still
there
was
no
haste
no
stir
no
apparent
effort
alix
came
to
her
own
porch
chair
for
the
long
twilight
she
brought
cherry
a
fluffy
shawl
they
were
almost
silent
and
as
the
last
light
faded
from
the
hills
and
the
valleys
were
flooded
with
violet
shadow
the
mountain
chill
came
down
and
the
stars
and
the
valley
lights
began
to
prick
the
dark
the
sisters
came
in
blinking
in
the
old
way
and
in
the
old
way
were
amazed
to
see
that
the
clock
hands
stood
at
ten
and
i
meant
you
to
go
early
to
bed
alix
exclaimed
but
cherry
with
her
kiss
answered
gratefully
ah
but
i
feel
that
i
am
going
to
sleep
i
not
been
sleeping
well
have
alix
asked
in
quick
concern
not
lately
cherry
stumbled
into
the
airy
dark
sweet
little
bedroom
and
somehow
undressed
and
crept
between
the
cool
sheets
of
the
bed
that
stood
near
alix
on
the
wide
sleeping
porch
her
last
thought
was
for
the
heavenly
redwoods
so
close
to
her
she
slept
indeed
for
almost
twelve
unbroken
hours
she
came
wandering
out
to
the
porch
at
eleven
the
old
smiling
apologetic
cherry
with
her
skin
dewy
from
a
bath
and
her
hair
freshly
brushed
and
her
linen
gown
as
pink
as
the
perkins
rose
that
was
blooming
over
her
head
oh
sis
i
do
feel
so
deliciously
lazy
and
happy
and
rested
and
and
everything
said
cherry
as
she
settled
herself
at
the
porch
table
where
service
for
one
was
spread
oh
alix
apricots
you
remember
everything
she
added
with
a
look
all
affectionate
appreciation
alix
panting
from
exertions
in
the
garden
dropped
trowel
in
hand
upon
the
upper
step
to
watch
her
smilingly
cherry
you
prettier
than
ever
alix
said
eyeing
the
white
hands
so
busy
with
blue
china
and
the
bright
head
dappled
with
shade
and
sunshine
coming
through
the
green
rose
vine
am
i
cherry
said
pleased
i
thought
myself
that
i
looked
nice
this
morning
she
added
innocently
but
it
is
really
because
the
air
of
this
place
agrees
with
me
it
makes
my
skin
feel
right
and
my
eyes
feel
right
it
makes
me
feel
normal
and
smoothed
out
somehow
and
cherry
looked
down
at
the
green
and
glitter
of
the
valley
looked
up
past
solemn
files
of
redwoods
at
the
mountain
this
morning
against
a
cloudless
sky
and
sighed
a
great
sigh
of
content
that
seemed
to
go
from
her
heels
to
the
crown
of
her
head
i
have
never
been
really
well
and
really
happy
anywhere
else
she
declared
out
of
deep
peace
and
content
oh
there
no
place
in
the
world
like
it
alix
agreed
rubbing
some
dried
mud
from
the
back
of
her
hand
with
the
trowel
peter
and
i
are
always
deciding
to
try
new
york
or
to
try
san
francisco
or
southern
california
but
somehow
we
do
if
martin
continues
to
migrate
every
little
while
i
wish
you
could
have
a
little
house
here
then
for
part
of
the
time
at
least
we
could
be
together
the
old
house
cherry
said
dreamily
well
why
not
alix
echoed
eagerly
it
in
pretty
bad
shape
after
being
empty
so
long
but
it
would
make
darling
home
again
would
martin
object
the
old
spoiled
cherry
with
the
pretty
petulant
frown
and
shrug
of
years
ago
martin
knows
what
he
could
do
she
drawled
naughtily
martin
would
be
here
some
of
the
time
alix
asked
a
little
anxiously
cherry
filled
her
coffee
cup
a
second
time
gave
kow
an
appreciative
smile
as
he
put
a
hot
french
loaf
before
her
and
said
indifferently
martin
has
a
constitutional
objection
to
whatever
pleases
me
and
would
find
some
objection
to
any
plan
that
gave
me
pleasure
her
tone
was
light
but
there
was
a
bitter
twitch
to
her
lips
as
she
spoke
oh
cherry
alix
said
distressed
however
i
not
going
to
talk
about
martin
the
younger
sister
decreed
gaily
i
too
utterly
and
absolutely
happy
there
was
a
worried
little
cloud
on
alix
forehead
but
it
lightened
steadily
as
the
happy
morning
wore
on
and
half
an
hour
later
when
she
and
cherry
were
sailing
a
frog
on
a
shingle
on
the
busy
little
stream
that
poured
down
the
hill
near
the
cabin
both
were
laughing
like
children
again
it
was
here
that
peter
found
cherry
alix
had
met
him
at
the
house
given
him
a
scrutinizing
look
with
her
quick
kiss
questioned
him
about
his
trip
and
reported
all
well
with
the
house
and
garden
and
now
come
down
to
the
creek
she
had
said
mischievously
the
bateses
are
here
not
alice
bates
he
had
asked
quickly
and
at
her
apologetic
nod
he
added
disgustedly
oh
thunder
oh
do
she
hear
you
said
the
beaming
alix
warningly
eyes
as
he
crossed
the
porch
were
gloomy
and
he
said
thunder
again
under
his
breath
they
followed
a
rough
little
trail
past
stumps
where
nasturtiums
and
alyssum
mingled
with
the
underbrush
and
were
in
the
redwoods
and
at
the
brookside
peter
saw
a
slender
girl
in
pink
pushing
a
plank
about
with
a
pole
she
turned
in
surprise
to
face
him
cherry
he
said
and
as
alix
laughed
delightedly
he
gave
his
wife
a
glance
and
said
you
liar
cherry
came
up
to
him
and
he
took
both
her
hands
and
after
a
second
of
hesitation
kissed
her
she
freed
one
hand
to
put
it
on
his
shoulder
and
standing
so
she
seriously
returned
his
kiss
for
a
moment
his
arm
encircled
her
waist
he
had
forgotten
how
blue
her
eyes
were
with
just
a
film
of
hair
loosened
above
them
and
what
husky
exquisite
childish
notes
were
in
her
voice
cherry
this
is
the
nicest
thing
that
has
happened
for
a
long
long
while
he
said
you
and
alix
are
angels
to
let
me
come
cherry
answered
as
they
turned
and
with
laughter
and
eager
interrupted
talking
went
back
to
the
house
and
how
do
you
think
your
big
sister
looks
oh
alix
is
wonderful
cherry
said
indeed
she
had
been
looking
at
alix
with
secret
surprise
and
admiration
since
her
arrival
alix
had
always
been
different
from
cherry
but
in
her
own
way
she
was
amazing
where
cherry
had
but
one
expensive
waist
but
one
beautiful
gown
but
two
or
three
elaborate
sets
of
filmy
lingerie
accumulated
slowly
and
laundered
by
herself
when
she
washed
her
silk
stockings
alix
like
a
child
changed
her
fresh
simple
linen
every
day
jumped
from
one
crisp
tub
suit
to
another
wore
untrimmed
straw
hats
that
she
bought
in
the
village
for
fifty
cents
apiece
alix
apparently
never
considered
the
relation
of
her
clothing
to
her
own
personality
she
simply
chose
the
simple
colours
and
styles
she
liked
and
aspired
only
to
be
always
fresh
and
trim
so
with
her
house
she
did
not
have
one
or
two
priceless
tablecloths
to
be
used
on
occasions
with
satin
underlaid
and
crystal
and
her
china
was
all
used
every
day
and
her
table
linen
cheap
and
plentiful
and
lavish
meals
were
always
simple
and
hearty
and
delicious
but
alix
had
not
time
for
fancy
touches
hated
as
she
frankly
admitted
all
that
stuffed
celery
and
chopped
nut
and
halved
cherry
business
if
soup
is
good
without
whipped
cream
and
sherry
in
it
it
pretty
poor
soup
cherry
had
laughed
at
her
even
years
ago
for
her
point
of
view
but
sometimes
she
had
felt
it
to
be
almost
an
advantage
at
all
events
she
had
not
been
hours
in
alix
house
without
perceiving
that
her
sister
was
singularly
free
and
unruffled
unlike
the
women
of
her
generation
alix
did
not
put
all
the
time
she
saved
to
good
use
although
she
puttered
away
in
the
garden
spent
an
hour
or
two
each
day
at
the
piano
and
was
as
she
confided
to
cherry
writing
a
novel
but
she
was
always
gay
and
always
fresh
and
enjoyed
every
moment
of
the
day
four
years
younger
yet
cherry
felt
older
than
she
alix
nature
was
uncomplicated
by
any
consciousness
of
self
again
like
a
child
she
only
wanted
people
to
love
each
other
and
be
happy
and
that
the
sun
should
shine
she
was
equally
content
whether
she
was
helping
peter
to
pile
wood
tramping
in
the
deluging
summer
rains
or
dreaming
over
a
book
through
the
long
evenings
with
her
shabby
slippers
to
the
fire
an
exquisite
spring
morning
with
wet
earth
rising
mists
and
shafts
of
pure
warm
sunlight
made
her
sing
like
the
forest
birds
all
about
her
but
even
on
the
coldest
and
blackest
of
winter
nights
when
the
storm
made
the
fluctuate
alarmingly
and
trees
creaked
over
the
cabin
she
would
look
up
from
the
piano
to
say
contentedly
well
i
rather
be
here
than
anywhere
else
anyway
naturally
she
was
unsympathetic
if
people
were
in
pain
or
cold
or
hungry
alix
could
sympathize
but
for
mental
and
spiritual
troubles
she
had
small
sympathy
almost
everybody
in
the
world
could
live
as
simply
as
we
do
she
told
peter
it
costs
us
about
four
thousand
a
year
he
said
well
it
need
we
could
buy
fewer
clothes
and
keep
only
one
cow
and
let
the
cook
go
we
be
just
as
happy
to
some
people
peter
had
objected
doubtfully
more
than
once
there
are
other
things
than
clothes
and
food
what
things
well
various
things
we
have
books
flowers
music
all
alix
protested
briskly
sympathy
my
dear
interpretation
tommyrot
she
had
responded
without
animosity
he
realized
with
surprise
not
many
months
after
their
marriage
that
she
meant
what
she
said
if
she
ate
and
slept
and
walked
and
read
with
her
usual
healthy
relish
she
needed
nothing
more
she
was
the
least
exacting
of
wives
if
he
was
late
for
a
meal
she
smiled
at
him
absently
or
if
after
they
had
entertained
he
apologetically
approached
her
with
some
reference
to
an
unfortunate
sentence
or
circumstances
she
would
meet
him
with
a
cheerful
angel
boy
i
never
heard
you
even
or
if
i
did
i
do
remember
it
even
if
i
had
heard
it
it
true
she
was
one
of
the
rare
women
who
can
take
marriage
calmly
as
a
matter
of
course
she
had
done
so
since
the
hour
that
made
her
his
wife
at
her
illness
she
had
rebelled
she
hated
nurses
and
their
fuss
she
said
she
was
perverse
with
doctors
in
an
unbelievably
short
time
her
magnificent
constitution
had
responded
she
was
well
again
at
his
side
at
the
steamer
rail
as
eager
for
the
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
of
hawaii
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
a
sick
room
her
only
sentiment
was
for
the
babies
and
small
animals
she
would
cuddle
rabbits
or
birds
against
her
brown
lean
cheek
and
hug
her
setter
enthusiastically
peter
suffered
an
agony
of
sympathy
whenever
she
spoke
of
a
child
i
hate
all
the
preliminary
fussing
pete
we
both
would
but
oh
if
the
lord
would
send
me
six
or
eight
of
them
then
and
then
only
did
the
bright
eyes
and
the
confident
voice
soften
and
then
only
was
alix
no
longer
a
flat
straight
splendid
boy
but
a
woman
indeed
chapter
xii
cherry
peter
saw
at
once
was
different
in
every
way
cherry
was
full
of
softness
of
ready
response
to
any
appeal
of
sympathy
and
comprehension
she
had
been
misunderstood
unhappy
neglected
she
had
developed
through
suffering
a
certain
timidity
that
was
almost
a
shrinking
a
certain
shy
clinging
to
what
was
kind
and
good
her
happiness
here
was
an
hourly
delight
to
both
alix
and
himself
she
seemed
to
flower
softly
every
day
of
the
simple
forest
life
brought
her
new
interest
new
energy
new
bloom
she
and
alix
washed
their
hair
again
dammed
the
creek
again
tramped
and
sang
duets
again
sometimes
they
cooked
often
they
went
into
the
old
senseless
spasms
of
laughter
at
nothing
or
almost
nothing
one
evening
when
in
the
sitting
room
there
was
no
other
light
than
that
of
the
fire
that
a
damp
july
evening
made
pleasant
about
a
week
after
her
arrival
cherry
spoke
for
the
first
time
of
martin
she
had
had
a
long
letter
from
him
that
day
ten
pages
written
in
a
flowing
hand
on
ten
pages
of
the
lined
paper
of
a
cheap
hotel
with
a
little
cut
of
the
building
standing
boldly
against
a
mackerel
sky
at
the
top
of
each
page
he
was
well
he
had
some
of
his
dinners
at
the
hotel
but
lived
at
home
he
had
been
playing
a
little
poker
and
was
luckier
than
ever
he
was
looking
into
a
proposition
in
durango
mexico
and
would
let
her
know
how
it
panned
out
the
letter
ended
with
the
phrases
have
a
good
time
babe
and
write
me
send
me
a
line
when
you
can
i
have
been
running
some
with
joe
king
but
i
am
not
strong
for
that
crowd
it
was
signed
mart
peter
had
been
playing
the
piano
lazily
when
the
letter
was
tossed
to
cherry
by
alix
who
usually
drove
into
the
village
every
morning
after
breakfast
for
marketing
and
the
mail
he
had
seen
cherry
glance
through
it
seen
the
little
distasteful
movement
of
the
muscles
about
her
nose
and
seen
her
put
it
carelessly
under
a
candlestick
on
the
mantel
for
later
consideration
at
luncheon
she
had
referred
to
it
and
now
it
evidently
had
caused
her
to
be
thoughtful
and
a
little
troubled
an
open
book
was
in
her
lap
she
and
alix
had
gone
through
the
farce
of
saying
that
they
would
read
without
speaking
until
peter
had
finished
some
business
telephoning
now
he
had
joined
them
but
still
she
did
not
read
and
seemed
disinclined
for
talk
mart
may
go
to
mexico
she
said
presently
with
a
sigh
to
stay
peter
asked
quickly
cherry
shrugged
as
much
as
he
stays
anywhere
she
answered
drily
h
does
that
mean
you
alix
asked
i
suppose
that
the
plan
cherry
said
lifelessly
it
a
rotten
country
peter
offered
thoughtfully
at
least
i
should
think
it
would
be
he
added
more
moderately
to
select
for
a
permanent
home
i
always
say
that
a
place
where
the
natives
are
black
or
yellow
is
fit
for
white
people
or
the
natives
would
be
white
alix
explained
brightly
all
mining
towns
are
horrible
cherry
said
with
gloomy
fervor
they
raw
crude
coarse
places
and
the
people
in
them
are
just
as
bad
peter
had
a
moment
of
pity
for
her
so
young
so
helpless
so
tied
perhaps
he
wo
want
you
until
he
is
sure
of
staying
he
offered
oh
mart
always
thinks
the
last
thing
is
the
permanent
thing
his
wife
answered
wearily
he
says
he
want
me
to
join
him
about
the
middle
of
august
oh
help
alix
said
disgustedly
cherry
was
silent
a
few
minutes
and
peter
smoked
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
alix
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
sighed
and
glanced
down
at
her
magazine
if
cherry
said
presently
if
i
get
my
money
i
have
enough
to
live
on
wo
i
peter
you
have
about
forty
thousand
dollars
yes
at
five
per
cent
you
could
live
on
that
especially
if
you
lived
here
in
the
valley
peter
answered
after
some
thought
then
i
want
you
to
know
cherry
went
on
quietly
with
sudden
scarlet
in
her
cheeks
that
i
going
to
tell
martin
i
think
we
have
tried
it
long
enough
peter
looked
gravely
at
her
soberly
nodded
and
resumed
his
study
of
the
fire
but
alix
spoke
in
brisk
protest
tried
it
you
mean
tried
marriage
but
one
does
try
marriage
a
fact
it
like
the
colour
of
your
eyes
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
anything
of
the
kind
cherry
said
mildly
lloyd
has
given
you
cause
eh
peter
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
long
enough
to
ask
briefly
not
not
in
the
way
you
mean
she
answered
glad
to
be
discussing
the
topic
h
peter
muttered
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
disappointed
but
peter
cherry
went
on
hesitatingly
appealingly
it
is
no
more
a
marriage
than
if
we
both
had
had
done
everything
and
anything
he
does
oh
love
cherry
interrupted
herself
scornfully
on
the
word
of
course
he
does
love
me
she
said
but
it
is
only
that
that
we
differ
in
every
way
about
everything
his
friends
his
ideas
his
feelings
about
things
i
ca
tell
you
how
we
jar
and
jar
on
each
other
no
said
cherry
beginning
to
cry
a
little
he
has
been
unfaithful
i
almost
wish
he
had
cherry
alix
protested
with
affectionate
reproach
alix
the
little
sister
pleaded
eagerly
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
do
know
what
it
is
always
meeting
people
i
do
like
always
living
in
places
i
hate
always
feeling
that
my
own
self
is
being
smothered
and
lost
and
shrunk
always
listening
to
mart
complaining
and
criticizing
people
do
appeal
to
alix
peter
said
she
does
care
what
she
does
or
where
she
lives
she
fraternized
with
every
old
maid
school
teacher
on
the
steamer
and
a
and
a
woman
whose
husband
was
a
native
of
borneo
and
she
would
pick
out
the
filthiest
lairs
in
honolulu
and
ask
me
if
it
would
be
fun
to
live
there
they
all
laughed
then
peter
added
seriously
i
go
this
far
cherry
lloyd
married
you
too
young
oh
far
too
young
she
agreed
quickly
the
thing
i
i
ca
think
of
she
said
is
how
young
i
was
only
a
little
girl
i
knew
nothing
i
was
ready
to
be
anybody
wife
something
in
the
poignant
sorrow
of
her
tone
went
straight
to
their
hearts
and
for
the
first
time
peter
had
an
idea
of
the
real
suffering
she
had
borne
alix
mouth
was
rather
firmly
shut
her
eyes
a
little
narrowed
her
face
rather
sad
as
she
looked
into
the
fire
if
i
had
a
child
even
or
if
martin
needed
me
cherry
said
then
it
might
be
different
but
i
only
a
burden
to
him
his
letter
does
sound
as
if
he
thought
of
you
as
a
burden
alix
suggested
mildly
ah
well
the
minute
i
leave
him
he
has
a
different
tone
cherry
explained
and
peter
said
with
a
glance
almost
of
surprise
at
his
wife
it
an
awfully
difficult
position
for
a
woman
of
any
pride
dear
alix
kneeling
to
adjust
the
fire
as
she
was
constantly
tempted
to
do
met
his
look
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
knee
pete
dearest
of
course
it
is
but
and
alix
looked
doubtfully
from
one
to
the
other
but
divorce
is
a
hateful
thing
she
added
shaking
her
head
it
it
never
seems
to
me
justifiable
divorce
is
an
institution
peter
said
you
may
not
like
it
any
more
than
you
like
prisons
or
it
has
its
uses
people
get
divorces
every
day
cherry
added
is
divorce
better
than
living
along
in
marriage
without
love
oh
love
alix
said
scornfully
love
is
just
another
name
for
passion
and
selfishness
and
laziness
half
the
time
you
can
say
that
because
yours
is
one
of
the
happy
marriages
cherry
said
it
might
be
very
different
if
peter
were
peter
as
she
said
his
name
she
sent
him
her
trusting
smile
her
blue
eyes
shone
with
affection
and
the
exquisite
curve
of
her
mouth
deepened
peter
smiled
back
and
looked
away
in
a
little
confusion
i
ca
imagine
the
circumstances
under
which
i
should
love
you
and
peter
alix
summarized
it
triumphantly
and
martin
peter
asked
ah
well
i
did
marry
martin
his
wife
reminded
him
quickly
i
did
promise
to
love
and
honour
martin
in
sickness
and
health
for
richer
for
poorer
for
better
for
worse
by
george
alix
interrupted
herself
in
her
boyish
way
those
are
terrific
words
you
know
and
a
promise
is
a
promise
and
even
for
infidelity
you
do
believe
people
ought
to
separate
cherry
asked
nonsense
peter
said
but
you
said
that
martin
never
no
i
not
speaking
of
martin
now
well
would
that
come
under
alix
asked
but
my
child
peter
expostulated
kindly
my
dear
benighted
wife
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
soul
a
mind
a
personality
to
be
tied
to
a
well
to
a
coarsening
influence
day
after
day
is
living
death
it
is
worse
than
any
bodily
discomfort
i
do
see
it
alix
persisted
i
think
there
a
lot
of
nonsense
talked
about
the
fammy
oncompreezy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
home
and
meals
and
books
and
friends
and
the
country
to
walk
in
you
oh
heavens
alix
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
cherry
interrupted
her
impatiently
let
peter
here
go
off
with
some
chorus
girl
and
see
how
long
you
it
all
very
well
in
books
alix
interrupted
her
sister
in
turn
but
in
real
life
i
do
believe
a
woman
ever
bothers
to
think
whether
her
husband
ever
murmurs
her
name
in
dreams
or
not
i
know
i
take
peter
as
much
for
granted
as
i
do
tamalpais
if
he
ever
leaped
from
the
track
and
stole
or
got
drunk
or
wandered
off
after
some
petticoat
fix
him
i
be
furious
but
i
do
see
myself
leaving
him
peter
brief
shout
of
laughter
rang
out
the
awful
thing
about
that
female
is
that
it
is
true
he
told
cherry
if
i
ever
stray
from
the
path
of
virtue
she
scare
me
to
death
sometimes
i
think
your
marriage
is
as
as
queer
as
my
own
cherry
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
nothing
more
was
said
for
several
days
upon
the
subject
of
a
possible
divorce
the
weather
continued
perfect
and
the
little
on
the
mountaintop
was
complete
in
itself
cherry
often
went
into
the
village
with
alix
to
be
sure
once
they
all
went
to
a
charity
affair
at
blithedale
sometimes
a
few
women
drove
up
the
winding
road
in
the
afternoon
and
there
were
and
cookies
on
the
porch
but
most
of
the
time
the
two
sisters
were
alone
with
peter
joining
them
in
the
afternoons
one
afternoon
peter
crossed
the
porch
tired
and
hot
and
found
everything
apparently
deserted
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
was
still
breathless
from
the
rapid
climb
when
stray
notes
from
the
piano
reached
his
ears
a
chord
a
carefully
played
bit
of
bass
then
a
chord
again
then
slowly
but
with
dainty
accuracy
and
even
feeling
cherry
began
to
play
a
strange
little
study
of
schumann
peter
knew
that
it
was
cherry
because
alix
touch
was
always
firm
and
sure
more
than
that
he
himself
had
played
this
same
bit
no
longer
ago
than
last
night
and
he
remembered
now
that
cherry
had
asked
him
just
what
it
was
he
experienced
a
sudden
and
pleasing
emotion
he
did
not
stop
to
analyze
it
but
he
had
been
ruffled
in
spirit
a
moment
before
alix
had
known
he
was
to
come
on
this
train
and
had
not
met
him
with
the
car
and
while
he
really
did
not
mind
the
walk
up
he
disliked
the
feeling
that
they
had
entirely
forgotten
him
the
car
was
gone
from
its
usual
stand
under
a
live
oak
but
everybody
had
not
forgotten
him
nevertheless
cherry
was
deliberately
recalling
the
mood
and
moment
that
also
recalled
him
and
as
the
notes
came
slowly
but
precisely
from
the
cool
darkened
living
room
with
its
fragrant
masses
of
sweet
peas
and
fluted
martha
washington
geraniums
peter
felt
contented
and
serene
he
looked
up
at
the
rise
of
tamalpais
only
half
a
tone
darker
than
the
pale
blue
sky
he
looked
off
at
the
range
toward
the
ocean
where
shimmers
of
heat
were
quivering
upward
and
then
he
settled
himself
back
luxuriously
in
his
great
wicker
chair
and
shut
his
eyes
still
the
plaintive
air
came
as
caressing
as
a
touch
presently
there
was
silence
then
cherry
tried
another
little
study
and
finished
it
and
the
hot
summer
stillness
reigned
again
the
valley
swam
under
a
haze
of
pure
heat
a
buzzard
hung
motionless
over
the
cabin
and
the
dry
air
was
sweet
with
resinous
scent
of
pines
and
manzanita
and
even
of
tarweed
with
a
sense
that
he
had
been
dozing
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
peter
opened
his
eyes
framed
in
the
cabin
doorway
poised
like
a
butterfly
against
the
dark
background
of
the
room
stood
cherry
he
knew
that
she
had
been
standing
so
for
some
time
for
a
full
minute
perhaps
more
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
one
hand
was
hanging
at
her
side
the
other
laid
over
her
heart
as
if
she
had
involuntarily
put
it
there
when
she
saw
him
her
hair
was
a
little
loosened
she
was
not
smiling
she
wore
something
limp
and
transparent
of
white
he
thought
or
pale
pale
blue
like
the
sky
with
faint
stripes
making
her
figure
look
more
slender
even
than
it
was
they
looked
at
each
other
in
a
silence
that
grew
more
and
more
awkward
by
great
plunges
peter
had
time
to
wish
that
he
had
kept
his
eyes
shut
to
wish
that
he
had
smiled
when
he
first
saw
her
he
could
not
have
forced
himself
to
smile
now
to
wonder
how
they
were
ever
to
speak
where
they
were
rushing
rushing
rushing
before
she
turned
noiselessly
and
vanished
into
the
dim
room
peter
lay
there
and
his
heart
pounded
for
a
few
minutes
his
senses
whirled
so
madly
that
he
felt
suffocated
he
dared
not
sit
up
he
dared
not
stir
from
head
to
foot
thrilling
waves
of
surprise
and
even
a
little
of
terror
went
over
him
never
in
his
life
had
he
experienced
this
sort
of
feeling
before
he
knew
that
he
hated
it
even
while
his
whole
spirit
sang
and
soared
in
the
new
ecstasy
a
moment
ago
he
had
been
a
tired
man
fretted
because
his
wife
forgot
to
meet
him
now
there
was
something
new
in
the
world
and
rapidly
all
the
world
became
only
a
background
only
a
setting
for
this
extraordinary
sensation
he
sat
up
after
awhile
looked
at
the
familiar
porch
with
the
potted
flowers
and
alix
boxes
where
marguerites
and
geraniums
had
been
alternated
to
make
a
touch
of
patriotic
colour
on
july
fourth
the
hills
beyond
still
swam
in
the
hot
sunlight
the
mountain
rose
into
the
blue
but
the
light
that
changes
all
life
lay
over
them
for
peter
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
awkward
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
enter
that
door
and
talk
to
cherry
and
yet
he
knew
that
that
meeting
of
cherry
that
the
common
exchange
of
words
and
glances
that
the
daily
trifling
encounters
with
cherry
were
all
poignantly
significant
now
or
if
he
did
not
fully
sense
all
this
yet
he
felt
thrilled
to
the
soul
with
the
knowledge
that
she
was
there
back
in
the
shadowy
house
somewhere
with
the
pale
striped
gown
and
the
disordered
hair
and
that
somehow
they
must
meet
somehow
they
must
talk
together
he
felt
no
impulse
toward
hurry
he
might
sit
on
this
porch
another
hour
might
saunter
off
toward
the
creek
it
mattered
nothing
the
hour
was
steadily
approaching
when
she
must
reappear
alix
drove
in
full
of
animated
apologies
she
managed
the
car
far
better
than
he
and
no
thought
of
an
accident
had
troubled
him
but
she
explained
that
she
had
been
to
get
eggs
for
a
setting
hen
and
antone
had
stopped
her
and
told
her
that
the
new
calf
had
been
prematurely
born
out
on
the
hills
and
had
been
gone
for
die
and
so
she
had
driven
over
to
juanita
and
gotten
the
calf
and
there
the
calf
was
two
days
old
and
as
pretty
as
only
a
baby
deer
or
a
baby
jersey
can
be
roped
by
his
woodeny
little
legs
and
laid
stiffly
in
the
tonneau
with
utter
terror
in
his
liquid
dark
eyes
die
nothing
alix
said
emphatically
as
she
tenderly
lifted
the
calf
out
of
the
car
i
going
to
take
him
up
to
the
barn
you
run
tell
kow
that
missy
wants
warm
milk
then
you
come
on
pete
and
tell
me
what
you
think
here
peter
said
authoritatively
shouting
the
message
and
taking
the
calf
from
her
arms
they
were
laughing
as
they
entered
the
dry
hot
darkness
of
the
stable
alix
riding
horse
put
a
roman
nose
reproachfully
over
the
bitten
barrier
of
his
we
got
company
for
you
peter
panting
from
his
heavy
burden
announced
poor
little
feller
he
said
to
the
calf
he
all
right
alix
rustling
straw
said
confidently
you
know
he
must
be
a
twin
she
said
to
peter
for
that
brute
of
a
mother
of
his
was
contentedly
wandering
up
to
the
ridge
where
the
breeze
is
and
she
certainly
had
another
little
calf
cavorting
about
her
oh
thanks
cherry
here
the
milk
peter
see
if
the
poor
little
beast
will
suck
your
fingers
peter
took
the
brimming
blue
bowl
from
cherry
fingers
she
had
come
like
a
shadow
into
the
barn
her
eyes
were
on
the
tipped
surface
of
the
milk
she
lowered
it
carefully
into
his
hold
and
he
felt
the
cool
softness
of
her
yielding
fingers
he
did
not
meet
her
eyes
partly
because
he
gave
her
face
only
one
glance
they
all
knelt
about
the
calf
who
after
a
few
feeble
struggles
to
escape
altogether
resigned
himself
and
lay
looking
at
them
with
terrified
eyes
he
too
weak
to
stand
on
his
legs
perhaps
i
should
have
had
the
mother
brought
in
alix
said
anxiously
but
he
a
beautiful
little
thing
the
prettiest
she
ever
had
except
that
he
so
thin
is
he
cute
cherry
he
darling
cherry
voice
with
its
young
cadences
always
ready
to
escape
from
the
riper
tones
of
womanhood
echoed
oddly
under
the
low
shingled
roof
of
the
barn
and
again
life
seemed
full
of
surprise
and
thrill
to
peter
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
her
could
think
of
nothing
and
so
was
unusually
silent
throughout
the
ceremonies
of
getting
the
calf
to
suck
alix
fingers
getting
him
tied
in
a
manner
that
should
hold
him
without
danger
of
strangulation
and
bedding
him
comfortably
on
sacks
and
straw
cherry
was
silent
too
but
alix
talked
briskly
and
the
necessity
for
constant
effort
and
movement
filled
all
possible
gaps
the
evening
was
warm
one
of
the
two
or
three
warm
evenings
that
marked
the
height
of
summer
even
in
the
high
valley
while
the
three
sat
on
the
wide
unroofed
porch
loitering
over
their
coffee
a
great
moon
rose
slowly
over
the
hill
and
floated
silently
above
them
presently
its
light
flooded
the
landscape
and
strange
and
romantic
vistas
appeared
between
the
redwoods
aisles
and
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
far
below
them
showed
in
a
brilliant
gray
light
soft
and
furry
the
whole
world
seemed
to
be
lifted
and
swimming
in
vaporous
brightness
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
in
the
garden
roses
and
wallflowers
stood
erect
in
a
sort
of
luminous
enchantment
moonlight
sank
through
the
low
twisted
branches
of
the
oaks
and
fell
tangled
with
black
and
lacy
shade
through
the
porch
rose
vine
alix
sat
on
the
porch
rail
every
line
of
crisp
skirt
and
braided
head
revealed
as
if
by
daylight
but
cherry
pale
striped
gown
was
only
a
glimmer
in
the
deepest
shade
of
the
vine
peter
smoking
sat
where
he
could
not
but
see
her
they
had
hardly
looked
at
each
other
directly
since
the
long
strange
look
of
this
afternoon
they
had
exchanged
hardly
a
word
a
black
cat
crept
across
the
grass
her
body
dragging
stealthily
on
crouched
legs
boldly
silhouetted
in
the
moonshine
invisible
in
the
shade
alix
defeated
her
hunting
plans
by
flinging
a
pebble
into
the
shrubbery
ahead
of
her
the
cat
dissembling
lay
down
in
the
dry
grass
cleaned
a
paw
and
coquetted
with
her
tail
town
pete
alix
said
after
a
silence
during
which
she
had
locked
her
arms
behind
her
head
stared
straight
above
her
at
the
path
the
moon
was
making
through
faint
stars
and
yawned
i
got
to
go
in
to
a
meeting
of
the
hospital
board
i
did
know
you
were
on
it
cherry
said
peter
mother
was
and
hence
i
am
alix
said
virtuously
cherry
felt
an
old
little
prick
of
jealousy
alix
was
strangely
indifferent
to
the
position
she
held
i
go
in
to
have
luncheon
with
mary
cherry
said
i
wish
we
could
all
lunch
together
i
blow
you
girls
to
a
meal
at
frank
peter
began
and
interrupted
himself
oh
but
you
ca
cherry
and
our
meeting
is
at
twelve
we
have
lunch
at
the
hospital
alix
added
would
you
think
we
have
enough
of
each
other
we
three
she
said
amusedly
beginning
in
the
reprehensible
manner
of
girlhood
to
roll
the
black
scarf
that
had
been
knotted
about
her
rolled
bluejacket
collar
and
to
remove
the
pins
from
her
hair
but
i
hate
to
be
in
town
and
not
see
you
both
beloveds
i
dead
do
sit
out
here
mooning
with
pete
all
night
cerise
peter
said
to
himself
that
now
cherry
would
go
too
but
as
the
screen
door
banged
lightly
after
alix
and
the
dull
glimmer
of
striped
gown
did
not
move
in
the
soft
shadow
a
sudden
reluctance
and
distaste
seized
him
he
had
been
subconsciously
aware
of
her
all
afternoon
he
had
known
a
delicious
warmth
and
stir
at
his
heart
that
he
had
not
analyzed
if
indeed
it
could
be
analyzed
now
suddenly
he
did
not
want
the
beauty
and
bloom
and
charm
of
that
feeling
touched
his
heart
began
to
beat
heavily
again
and
he
knew
that
he
must
stop
the
unavailing
game
now
but
he
had
not
reckoned
on
cherry
she
twisted
in
her
chair
and
he
heard
a
child
long
happy
sigh
oh
so
am
i
tired
too
she
breathed
reluctantly
i
hate
to
leave
it
but
i
been
almost
asleep
for
half
an
hour
you
can
have
all
the
moonlight
there
is
peter
her
white
figure
fluttered
toward
the
door
she
said
drooping
her
little
head
to
choke
a
yawn
a
moment
later
he
heard
her
laughing
with
alix
you
fool
you
fool
you
fool
peter
said
to
himself
and
he
felt
an
emotion
like
shame
a
little
real
compunction
that
he
could
so
utterly
misread
her
innocence
he
felt
it
not
only
wrong
in
him
but
somehow
staining
and
hurtful
to
her
chapter
xiii
again
peter
reckoned
without
cherry
it
was
only
the
next
day
when
he
was
entering
the
palace
court
for
his
lunch
that
he
experienced
a
sudden
and
violent
emotion
his
thoughts
were
at
the
moment
far
from
cherry
and
he
had
fancied
himself
in
a
hurry
but
every
other
feeling
but
excitement
was
obliterated
at
the
sight
of
a
slender
girlishly
made
woman
in
a
pongee
gown
and
a
limp
brown
hat
covered
with
poppies
waiting
in
the
lounge
peter
went
toward
her
and
the
colour
rushed
into
cherry
face
half
a
dozen
women
had
been
furtively
studying
her
and
one
of
them
now
said
to
a
man
yes
she
really
is
extraordinarily
pretty
but
cherry
and
peter
saw
and
heard
them
not
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
accidentally
encountered
each
other
and
it
had
a
special
place
of
its
own
in
the
history
of
their
lives
the
surprise
of
it
kept
them
laughing
hands
clasped
for
a
minute
then
cherry
said
i
was
to
lunch
here
with
mary
cameron
but
she
full
twenty
minutes
late
lunch
with
me
peter
substituted
promptly
she
probably
be
along
cherry
said
vaguely
looking
at
a
clock
you
hate
her
do
you
she
added
looking
up
from
under
the
poppies
at
peter
i
do
like
her
he
admitted
with
a
boy
grimace
then
suppose
we
do
lunch
here
cherry
suggested
innocently
peter
laughed
joyously
and
tucking
her
little
gloved
hand
under
his
arm
led
her
away
they
went
to
solari
and
had
a
window
table
and
nodded
as
they
discussed
their
lunch
at
half
a
dozen
friends
who
chanced
to
be
lunching
there
too
but
it
was
a
thrilling
adventure
none
the
less
and
after
the
other
tables
were
empty
and
when
the
long
room
was
still
they
talked
on
trifling
with
cheese
and
crackers
peter
watching
her
as
he
smoked
cherry
head
bent
over
her
plate
she
had
said
that
she
wanted
to
tell
him
all
about
it
and
peter
with
quick
knowledge
that
she
meant
the
unhappiness
of
her
marriage
nodded
a
grave
permission
i
made
a
failure
of
it
cherry
said
sadly
i
know
i
ought
to
struggle
on
but
i
ca
just
a
few
days
of
it
just
a
few
weeks
of
it
make
me
make
me
a
different
woman
i
get
nervous
i
get
hysterical
i
do
sleep
i
have
no
individuality
peter
i
have
no
personality
as
for
my
dignity
my
privacy
her
face
was
scarlet
and
for
a
moment
she
stopped
speaking
just
tell
me
an
alternative
she
said
after
awhile
it
ca
be
that
there
is
no
other
life
for
me
than
going
back
peter
i
only
i
know
you
are
he
said
with
a
brief
nod
why
everyone
has
some
alternative
cherry
pleaded
it
ca
be
that
marriage
is
the
only
the
only
irrevocable
thing
if
you
had
a
partner
that
you
could
go
on
with
you
could
come
to
some
agreement
you
could
make
a
sacrifice
but
somehow
you
could
end
the
association
peter
she
said
earnestly
when
i
think
of
marketing
again
six
chops
and
and
butter
and
baking
powder
i
feel
sick
when
i
think
of
unpacking
the
things
i
washed
and
dusted
for
five
years
the
glass
berry
bowl
that
somebody
gave
us
and
the
eleven
silver
i
ca
bear
it
you
do
love
him
peter
said
i
do
hate
him
she
answered
quickly
indeed
i
do
and
it
just
the
place
and
the
life
peter
i
could
be
happy
in
two
rooms
somewhere
anywhere
but
not
with
him
oh
peter
if
i
done
it
if
i
had
done
it
and
cherry
knotted
her
fingers
together
and
her
voice
thickened
and
stopped
her
beauty
as
she
pushed
her
plate
aside
and
leaned
toward
him
was
so
startling
that
peter
a
lighted
match
to
a
fresh
cigarette
put
the
match
down
aimlessly
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
cigarette
and
laid
that
down
too
without
the
faintest
consciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
the
day
was
warm
and
there
was
a
little
dampness
on
her
white
forehead
where
the
gold
hair
clung
to
the
brim
of
the
drooping
hat
her
marvellous
blue
eyes
were
ringed
with
soft
violet
shadows
as
if
a
sooty
finger
had
set
them
under
the
dark
brown
arch
of
the
brows
the
soft
curve
of
her
chin
the
babyish
shortness
of
her
upper
lip
and
the
crimson
sweetness
of
the
little
earnest
mouth
had
never
seemed
more
lovely
than
they
were
she
was
youth
incarnate
palpitating
flushed
unspoiled
for
a
moment
she
looked
down
at
the
table
and
the
colour
flooded
her
face
then
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
and
smiled
well
perhaps
it
will
all
work
out
right
peter
she
said
with
the
childish
questioning
look
that
so
wrung
his
heart
she
immediately
gathered
her
possessions
together
to
go
but
when
they
stepped
into
sunshiny
geary
street
it
was
three
and
peter
suggested
that
they
walk
down
to
the
boat
to
them
both
the
hour
was
memorable
and
the
street
and
park
and
the
tops
of
tall
buildings
flooded
with
the
sunlight
of
a
summer
afternoon
were
paradise
cherry
only
knew
that
she
felt
strangely
thrilled
and
yet
at
peace
peter
heart
was
bursting
with
love
of
the
world
love
of
this
romantic
city
with
its
flower
market
blazing
in
the
sun
and
with
the
ferry
clock
tower
standing
high
above
the
vista
of
market
street
he
seemed
floating
rather
than
walking
and
when
at
crossings
he
could
help
cherry
for
a
few
steps
felicity
swelled
in
his
soul
almost
like
pain
they
met
alix
on
the
boat
but
she
did
not
ask
any
embarrassing
questions
she
sat
between
them
on
the
upper
deck
blinking
contentedly
at
the
blue
satin
bay
her
eyes
following
the
wheeling
gulls
or
the
passage
of
ships
her
mind
evidently
concerned
only
with
the
idle
pleasantness
of
the
moment
and
always
for
peter
there
was
the
same
joyous
sense
of
something
new
something
significant
something
ecstatic
in
life
from
that
hour
he
was
never
quite
at
ease
in
cherry
company
and
avoided
being
alone
with
her
even
for
an
instant
although
her
presence
always
caused
him
the
new
and
tingling
delight
he
read
her
honest
blue
eyes
truly
and
knew
that
although
like
himself
she
was
conscious
of
the
new
sweetness
and
brightness
of
life
she
had
never
entertained
for
an
instant
the
flitting
thought
that
it
was
peter
feeling
for
her
that
made
it
so
she
thought
perhaps
that
it
was
the
old
childish
happiness
that
she
had
known
in
the
valley
the
freedom
and
leisure
and
irresponsibility
of
the
old
days
one
day
she
made
alix
and
peter
laugh
by
reciting
for
them
long
passages
from
paolo
and
francesca
they
were
walking
and
had
stopped
to
rest
and
get
breath
on
a
steep
climb
cherry
tender
voice
and
repeating
the
passionate
lines
lingered
in
peter
mind
like
a
sort
of
faint
incense
for
hours
it
lovely
said
cherry
in
the
garden
that
night
when
he
spoke
to
her
about
it
but
it
not
shakespere
of
course
she
surprised
him
by
adding
cherry
had
developed
he
thought
she
had
cared
nothing
for
shakespere
years
ago
immediately
she
began
the
immortal
phrases
is
but
the
name
that
is
mine
enemy
thou
art
thyself
though
not
a
montague
and
for
that
name
which
is
no
part
of
thee
take
all
myself
peter
heart
began
to
thump
again
they
were
alone
in
the
garden
it
was
dark
warm
and
starry
now
that
you
and
i
are
brother
and
sister
cherry
said
after
a
silence
tell
me
it
went
across
my
mind
once
and
then
i
did
think
of
it
for
years
but
tell
me
was
it
me
with
whom
you
were
you
fancied
you
were
in
love
all
those
years
ago
she
looked
innocently
up
at
him
in
the
gloom
and
laughed
peter
did
not
speak
for
a
few
seconds
yes
it
was
always
you
he
said
then
briefly
cherry
laughed
again
a
little
amused
and
exultant
laugh
but
immediately
she
stopped
laughing
and
said
vexedly
i
was
a
fool
to
ask
you
that
i
do
know
why
i
did
just
sheer
egotism
and
i
hate
women
who
dwell
on
their
own
foolish
old
love
affairs
too
peter
as
ashamed
as
she
of
the
moment
weakness
laughed
too
you
could
hardly
call
it
that
he
objected
mildly
you
could
hardly
call
it
anything
she
agreed
in
relief
does
alix
know
she
asked
quickly
there
was
much
to
tell
he
reminded
her
as
they
went
back
to
the
house
through
the
ranks
of
wet
wallflowers
and
roses
nothing
she
said
again
quickly
and
when
they
entered
the
house
he
was
strangely
disturbed
to
see
a
look
of
something
like
shame
something
confused
and
embarrassed
on
her
usually
frank
little
face
and
to
realize
that
she
was
conscientiously
avoiding
his
eyes
after
she
and
alix
had
gone
to
bed
he
got
down
the
little
red
volume
that
was
marked
romeo
and
juliet
and
found
the
score
of
lines
that
she
had
quoted
and
marvelled
that
the
same
words
could
seem
on
the
printed
page
so
bare
and
sound
so
rich
and
full
in
cherry
voice
out
under
the
stars
the
next
day
she
talked
in
a
troubled
uncertain
way
of
going
back
to
red
creek
and
he
knew
why
but
alix
was
so
aghast
at
the
idea
and
peter
who
was
closing
doctor
strickland
estate
was
so
careful
to
depart
early
in
the
mornings
and
return
only
late
at
night
that
the
little
alarm
if
it
was
that
died
away
martin
plans
were
uncertain
and
cherry
might
be
needed
as
a
witness
in
the
will
case
if
claims
were
proved
unjustified
so
that
neither
peter
nor
cherry
could
find
a
logical
argument
with
which
to
combat
alix
protests
against
any
change
the
next
time
that
cherry
went
into
town
alix
did
not
go
and
peter
sitting
on
the
deck
of
the
early
boat
with
her
asked
her
again
to
have
luncheon
with
him
immediately
a
cloud
fell
on
her
face
and
he
saw
her
breast
rise
quickly
peter
she
asked
him
childishly
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
why
did
we
tell
alix
about
that
peter
tried
to
laugh
and
felt
himself
begin
to
tremble
again
about
what
he
stammered
about
our
having
been
three
hours
at
lunch
last
week
why
i
do
know
peter
said
smiling
nervously
she
was
silent
and
they
parted
without
any
further
reference
to
meeting
for
lunch
but
every
time
he
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
peter
felt
a
thrill
of
expectation
and
at
noon
his
office
swam
suddenly
before
his
eyes
when
the
lovely
voice
was
really
addressing
him
she
was
at
the
ferry
cherry
said
she
had
finished
shopping
and
was
going
home
that
fine
peter
said
quite
as
he
would
have
said
it
a
month
ago
but
he
was
shaking
as
he
went
back
to
his
work
that
night
when
alix
had
gone
to
bed
he
entered
the
sitting
room
suddenly
to
find
cherry
hunting
for
a
book
she
had
dropped
on
one
knee
the
better
to
reach
a
low
shelf
and
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
volume
she
had
chanced
to
open
when
she
heard
the
door
open
she
turned
and
immediately
became
very
pale
she
did
not
speak
as
peter
came
to
stand
beside
her
cherry
he
said
in
a
whisper
his
face
close
to
hers
neither
spoke
again
for
awhile
cherry
was
breathing
hard
peter
was
conscious
only
of
a
wild
whirling
of
brain
and
senses
they
remained
so
their
eyes
fixed
their
breath
coming
as
if
they
had
been
running
for
endless
seconds
you
remember
the
question
you
asked
me
this
morning
peter
said
do
you
remember
do
you
remember
cherry
her
cold
fingers
still
holding
the
place
in
the
book
she
had
been
reading
went
blindly
to
the
fireplace
what
she
said
in
the
merest
breath
what
because
peter
said
following
her
a
sort
of
heady
madness
making
him
only
conscious
of
that
need
to
hear
from
her
own
lips
that
she
knew
because
i
did
answer
that
question
honestly
it
mattered
not
what
he
said
or
what
he
was
trying
to
express
both
were
enveloped
in
the
flame
of
their
new
relationship
surprise
and
terror
were
eclipsing
even
the
strange
joy
of
their
discovery
i
must
go
home
i
must
go
back
to
mart
cherry
said
in
a
whispered
undertone
as
if
half
to
herself
i
must
go
home
to
mart
i
let
not
let
not
talk
she
broke
off
in
quick
interruption
as
he
would
have
spoken
let
i
rather
not
i
where
is
my
book
what
was
i
doing
peter
peter
just
a
minute
peter
protested
thickly
cherry
i
want
to
speak
to
you
will
you
wait
a
minute
she
was
halfway
to
the
door
now
she
paused
and
looked
back
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
peter
did
not
speak
at
once
there
was
a
moment
of
absolute
silence
chapter
xiv
and
in
that
moment
alix
came
in
she
had
said
half
an
hour
before
she
was
in
her
wrapper
and
her
hair
fell
over
one
shoulder
in
a
rumpled
braid
cherry
sick
with
fright
faced
her
in
a
sort
of
horror
unable
to
realize
at
the
moment
that
there
was
nothing
betraying
in
her
attitude
or
peter
and
nothing
in
her
unsuspicious
soul
to
give
significance
to
what
she
saw
in
any
case
peter
more
quickly
recovering
went
toward
his
wife
alix
saw
neither
clearly
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
she
had
a
paper
in
her
hand
pete
she
said
cherry
look
at
this
look
at
this
she
held
the
paper
out
to
them
but
it
was
rather
at
her
that
they
looked
as
all
three
gathered
near
the
hearth
again
i
happened
to
finish
my
novel
alix
said
and
i
reached
for
old
bible
it
been
there
on
the
shelf
near
my
bed
ever
since
i
was
married
and
i
even
read
it
too
but
look
what
was
in
it
there
all
this
time
what
is
it
cherry
asked
as
peter
in
a
sudden
and
violent
revulsion
of
feeling
took
the
paper
and
bent
toward
the
lamp
to
read
it
by
george
he
said
suddenly
his
eyes
still
running
over
the
by
george
this
is
wonderful
it
uncle
vincent
receipt
to
dad
for
that
three
thousand
that
is
making
all
the
trouble
alix
exulted
to
the
still
bewildered
cherry
it
been
there
all
this
time
and
cherry
she
added
in
a
voice
rich
with
love
and
memory
that
what
he
meant
by
saying
it
was
in
matthew
do
you
remember
does
it
mean
that
pete
is
it
perfectly
clear
it
means
only
about
fifty
thousand
for
you
and
cherry
peter
answered
yes
sir
by
george
it
perfectly
clear
he
paid
it
back
every
cent
of
it
and
got
his
receipt
h
this
puts
rather
a
crimp
in
little
plans
i
see
him
this
calls
off
his
suit
really
pete
alix
asked
with
dancing
eyes
and
it
means
that
you
can
keep
the
old
house
cerise
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
and
we
can
be
together
part
of
the
year
anyway
oh
come
on
everybody
and
sit
down
and
let
talk
and
talk
about
it
let
me
see
it
again
recognition
of
all
claims
against
the
patent
extinguisher
aforementioned
sit
down
pete
it
only
ten
let
talk
are
you
simply
wild
with
joy
cherry
but
she
told
peter
later
that
she
had
been
surprised
at
quietness
cherry
had
looked
pale
and
abstracted
and
had
not
seemed
half
enthusiastic
enough
though
very
probably
mused
alix
it
brought
back
dad
death
and
saddened
her
in
that
way
and
more
than
that
i
know
she
is
worried
all
the
time
about
feeling
as
she
does
toward
martin
and
perhaps
feel
that
she
ought
to
put
this
into
some
horrible
mining
scheme
cherry
is
not
mercenary
i
say
that
for
her
what
will
you
do
with
all
yours
peter
asked
i
wish
we
three
could
go
about
the
world
together
alix
answered
i
love
to
see
japan
and
india
i
like
to
see
on
the
sacred
gunga
she
added
cheerfully
but
i
do
know
money
buy
you
much
she
yawned
perhaps
i
go
to
some
old
ladies
home
and
give
each
of
the
old
girls
one
hundred
dollars
a
quarter
they
have
fun
buying
scarfs
and
wool
and
caps
their
families
would
immediately
remove
them
for
the
revenue
peter
suggested
he
was
grinning
at
her
he
felt
suddenly
the
wholesomeness
and
safety
of
her
absurdity
and
originality
he
liked
the
characteristic
earnestness
with
which
in
the
very
act
of
snapping
off
her
bedroom
light
before
going
out
to
the
she
widened
her
eyes
at
him
and
frowned
in
concentrated
thought
then
i
give
them
fifty
dollars
a
quarter
she
decided
just
enough
to
buy
them
some
little
things
you
know
brass
flannel
underwear
whatever
they
wanted
presents
they
must
always
want
to
be
making
christmas
presents
and
she
yawned
again
shut
your
door
pete
if
you
read
she
said
the
light
shines
against
the
trees
and
it
right
in
my
eyes
but
ten
minutes
later
he
heard
her
call
through
the
door
or
i
could
give
it
on
condition
that
they
stayed
in
the
home
and
did
let
their
families
get
it
and
grinned
again
over
his
book
after
that
there
was
silence
and
gradually
the
little
sounds
of
the
summer
night
made
themselves
heard
again
alix
light
was
out
cherry
came
trailing
her
thin
wrapper
to
the
porch
bed
opposite
her
bed
and
slipped
into
it
with
only
a
brief
but
peter
read
on
deep
into
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
kow
yu
flinging
the
striped
blue
tablecloth
over
the
porch
table
the
next
day
at
the
noon
hour
and
clinking
knives
and
forks
was
questioned
by
his
master

said
missy

unruffled
him

peter
shouted
did
alix
say

was
coming
to
lunch
to

cherry
answered
from
the
garden
she
came
up
to
the
porch
with
her
hands
full
of
roses
him
go
flend
house
kow
elucidated
fiend
heap
sick
mrs
garvin
cherry
questioned
did
she
stay
at
garvin
for
lunch
perhaps
it
the
garvin
baby
she
added
to
peter
she
said
she
was
going
to
stop
in
i
find
out
peter
was
conscious
that
everything
was
beginning
to
tremble
and
thrill
again
as
he
went
to
the
telephone
why
yes
he
said
coming
back
to
the
porch
the
baby
arrived
just
before
she
got
there
and
they
were
all
upset
she
in
her
glory
of
course
says
that
she
be
home
to
supper
even
if
she
goes
back
oh
cherry
said
in
a
small
voice
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
shook
out
her
napkin
peter
sat
down
too
and
as
usual
served
kow
came
and
went
and
a
silence
deepened
and
spread
and
grew
more
and
more
terrible
every
instant
it
was
a
sunday
foggy
and
overcast
but
not
cold
the
vines
about
the
porch
were
covered
with
tiny
beads
of
moisture
among
the
bushes
in
the
garden
little
scarfs
and
veils
of
fog
were
caught
and
from
far
across
the
ridge
the
droning
warning
of
the
fog
horn
penetrated
at
regular
brief
intervals
cherry
peter
said
suddenly
when
the
silent
meal
was
almost
over
will
you
talk
about
it
talk
she
faltered
her
voice
thickened
and
stopped
oh
i
would
rather
not
she
whispered
with
a
frightened
glance
about
listen
cherry
he
said
following
her
to
the
wide
porch
rail
and
standing
behind
her
as
she
sat
down
upon
it
i
sorry
i
just
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
but
i
ca
help
it
cherry
and
i
would
like
i
do
think
it
would
be
wiser
just
to
to
look
the
matter
squarely
in
the
face
and
and
perhaps
discuss
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
end
it
she
gave
him
a
fleeting
glance
over
her
shoulder
but
she
did
not
go
away
peter
sat
down
behind
her
on
the
rail
and
she
turned
to
face
him
although
her
troubled
eyes
were
still
averted
cherry
he
said
then
i
as
surprised
as
you
are
i
ca
tell
you
when
it
it
all
happened
but
it
peter
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
with
a
grimly
squared
jaw
looked
off
into
the
misty
distance
it
is
there
he
finished
oh
i
so
sorry
cherry
whispered
on
a
breath
of
utter
distress
i
so
sorry
oh
peter
we
never
should
have
let
it
happen
our
caring
for
each
other
we
never
should
have
allowed
ourselves
to
think
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
oh
peter
i
so
sick
about
it
cherry
added
incoherently
with
filling
eyes
i
just
sick
about
it
i
know
i
know
that
alix
would
never
have
permitted
herself
to
i
know
she
would
he
was
close
to
her
and
now
he
laid
his
hand
over
hers
i
care
he
said
quite
involuntarily
i
have
always
cared
for
you
i
know
it
madness
i
know
it
too
late
but
i
love
every
hair
of
your
beautiful
head
cherry
cherry
they
had
both
gotten
to
their
feet
and
now
she
essayed
to
pass
him
her
face
white
her
cheeks
blazing
he
stopped
her
and
held
her
close
in
his
arms
and
after
a
few
seconds
he
felt
her
resisting
muscles
relax
and
they
kissed
each
other
for
a
full
dizzy
minute
they
clung
together
arms
locked
hearts
beating
madly
and
close
and
lips
meeting
again
and
again
breathless
cherry
wrenched
herself
free
and
turned
to
drop
into
a
chair
and
breathless
peter
stood
looking
down
upon
her
about
them
was
the
silence
of
the
dripping
garden
all
the
sounds
of
the
world
came
muffled
and
dull
through
the
thick
mist
then
peter
knelt
down
beside
her
chair
and
gathered
her
hands
together
in
his
own
and
she
rested
her
forehead
on
his
and
spent
and
silent
leaned
against
his
shoulder
and
so
they
remained
not
speaking
for
a
long
while
kow
clinked
dishes
somewhere
in
a
faraway
kitchen
and
the
boomed
and
was
and
was
still
but
here
on
the
porch
there
was
no
sound
cherry
tell
me
that
you
care
for
me
a
little
peter
said
after
awhile
and
he
felt
as
if
he
met
a
new
cherry
among
all
the
strange
new
cherries
that
the
past
bewildering
week
had
shown
him
when
she
answered
passionately
oh
peter
peter
if
i
did
not
he
tightened
his
fingers
about
her
own
but
did
not
answer
and
it
was
presently
cherry
who
broke
the
brooding
misty
silence
again
what
shall
we
do
she
asked
in
a
small
tired
voice
peter
abruptly
got
to
his
feet
took
a
chair
three
feet
away
and
with
a
quick
gesture
of
his
hand
and
toss
of
his
head
flung
back
his
hair
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
of
course
he
said
decidedly
in
a
voice
almost
unrecognizably
grim
we
must
see
each
other
we
must
see
each
other
now
now
i
must
think
how
best
to
manage
that
her
eyes
heavy
with
pain
were
raised
to
meet
his
and
she
saw
his
mouth
weaken
with
a
sudden
misgiving
and
she
saw
him
try
to
steady
it
and
look
down
i
can
i
shall
tell
alix
that
this
new
business
needs
me
in
town
for
two
or
three
nights
he
said
forcing
himself
to
quiet
speech
but
with
one
fine
hand
propping
his
forehead
as
if
it
ached
i
stay
at
the
club
and
as
soon
as
i
can
go
cherry
added
feverishly
i
shall
join
martin
i
suppose
alix
would
think
it
was
perfectly
idiotic
for
me
to
go
now
just
when
the
whole
thing
can
be
closed
up
so
quickly
and
martin
too
her
voice
trailed
away
vaguely
she
fell
silent
her
eyes
absent
and
full
of
pain
suddenly
they
widened
as
if
some
pang
had
suddenly
shaken
her
into
consciousness
again
well
i
go
back
she
began
again
bravely
i
leave
you
power
what
do
they
call
it
power
to
act
for
me
i
can
do
that
ca
i
i
wire
martin
this
is
sunday
and
i
go
on
wednesday
and
as
she
looked
off
across
the
green
spaces
of
hills
and
valleys
they
seemed
to
turn
suddenly
glaring
and
ugly
to
her
and
she
felt
a
great
weariness
and
heartsickness
with
life
peter
sprang
over
the
porch
rail
and
vanished
walking
with
swift
energy
up
the
trail
that
led
toward
the
mountain
cherry
knew
that
he
would
walk
himself
tired
she
longed
to
walk
too
to
plunge
on
and
on
through
the
foggy
depths
of
the
hills
striding
stumbling
getting
breathless
and
weary
in
body
while
somehow
somehow
this
confusion
and
exhaustion
cleared
away
from
mind
and
soul
and
yet
beyond
the
horror
and
shame
and
regret
she
felt
something
was
thrilling
exulting
and
singing
for
joy
for
the
rest
of
that
day
she
lived
in
a
sort
of
daze
of
emotion
sometimes
she
seemed
to
be
living
two
lives
side
by
side
in
the
one
was
her
old
happy
relationship
with
alix
and
even
with
peter
the
old
joking
and
talking
and
gathering
for
meals
the
old
hours
in
the
garden
or
beside
the
fire
and
in
the
other
was
the
confused
and
troubled
and
ecstatic
consciousness
of
the
new
relationship
between
peter
and
herself
the
knowledge
that
he
did
not
merely
admire
her
did
not
merely
feel
for
her
an
unusual
affection
but
that
he
was
consumed
by
a
burning
adoration
of
her
slightest
motion
the
turn
of
her
wrist
the
smile
she
gave
kow
at
breakfast
time
the
motion
she
made
when
she
stooped
to
tie
her
shoe
or
raised
her
arm
to
break
an
apple
from
the
low
dusty
branches
the
glory
of
being
so
loved
enveloped
her
like
a
great
shining
garment
and
her
cheeks
glowed
softly
rosy
and
there
was
a
new
and
liquid
softness
a
sort
of
shining
glitter
in
her
blue
eyes
peter
was
quiet
that
evening
and
was
gone
the
next
morning
when
the
sisters
came
out
to
breakfast
his
absence
was
a
real
relief
to
cherry
who
felt
curiously
tired
and
spent
after
a
wakeful
night
and
looked
pale
alix
busy
with
a
new
venture
in
duck
raising
noticed
nothing
and
cherry
could
lie
idly
in
the
hammock
all
morning
sometimes
frowning
and
shutting
her
eyes
at
some
sudden
thought
otherwise
smiling
and
dreaming
vaguely
and
always
hearing
peter
voice
in
words
so
charged
with
new
magic
that
the
mere
recollection
of
them
almost
suffocated
her
with
emotion
he
had
left
a
message
to
the
effect
that
he
would
not
be
at
home
that
night
and
at
four
telephoned
confirming
the
message
alix
chanced
to
answer
the
telephone
and
cherry
who
was
in
her
room
heard
peter
name
and
stood
still
listening
with
a
shock
of
disappointment
she
did
not
want
him
to
come
home
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
any
desire
or
dread
her
only
thought
was
that
he
was
there
now
at
the
telephone
and
in
a
moment
alix
would
have
hung
up
the
receiver
and
she
cherry
would
not
have
spoken
to
him
would
not
have
heard
his
voice
but
at
eight
that
evening
when
she
and
alix
were
sitting
on
the
porch
when
the
last
ebbing
pink
of
the
sunset
had
faded
and
great
spiders
had
ventured
forth
into
the
dusk
and
the
dews
there
was
a
sudden
hail
at
the
gate
and
cherry
knew
that
it
was
he
a
flood
of
utter
irrational
happiness
rose
in
her
heart
she
had
been
racked
with
hunger
for
the
sound
of
that
voice
she
had
been
restless
and
unsatisfied
almost
feverish
with
longing
and
doubt
now
peace
came
again
and
content
he
came
up
to
them
his
glance
resolutely
averted
from
cherry
explaining
that
he
was
lonesome
assuring
them
that
everything
went
well
and
making
them
laugh
with
an
account
of
justin
reception
of
the
new
turn
of
affairs
alix
asked
a
hundred
questions
laughed
and
rejoiced
let
go
down
and
see
the
old
house
suggested
alix
i
guess
it
in
pretty
bad
shape
for
we
could
rent
it
at
least
pete
and
i
did
think
it
was
worth
while
to
do
all
the
plastering
and
painting
they
wanted
but
we
do
it
now
cherry
we
fix
it
all
up
and
then
every
summer
and
perhaps
some
winters
at
least
if
mart
too
far
away
you
can
live
there
did
you
see
anne
peter
she
asked
suddenly
no
just
justin
he
seemed
absolutely
dumbfounded
peter
said
he
looked
at
the
paper
read
it
laughed
and
said
in
that
little
nervous
smiling
way
of
his
that
he
felt
it
to
be
by
no
means
conclusive
i
can
hear
him
giggled
alix
and
i
guess
both
you
girls
will
have
to
come
in
in
a
day
or
two
peter
continued
cherry
going
in
to
the
dentist
said
alix
oh
so
i
am
cherry
said
in
a
rather
strained
voice
she
did
not
look
at
peter
nor
did
he
at
her
but
they
felt
each
other
thoughts
like
a
spoken
word
had
you
forgotten
alix
asked
i
may
go
with
you
she
added
carelessly
oh
do
come
cherry
said
eagerly
i
i
hate
so
going
alone
i
not
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
in
town
but
i
browse
along
those
old
book
stores
in
third
street
alix
mused
but
in
the
morning
she
had
changed
her
mind
she
was
a
trifle
late
to
breakfast
and
cherry
and
peter
had
a
chance
minute
or
two
alone
cherry
he
said
then
i
going
to
lunch
at
the
francis
will
you
meet
me
there
no
i
ca
cherry
whispered
unhappily
well
i
be
there
peter
said
in
a
dull
steady
voice
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
as
cherry
began
with
trembling
white
ringers
to
strip
the
black
fine
skin
from
a
fig
a
moment
later
alix
joined
them
she
had
come
in
from
her
ducks
and
ate
but
a
hasty
and
indifferent
breakfast
so
that
she
might
the
sooner
begin
to
prepare
their
meal
the
ducks
had
been
regaled
of
late
on
the
minced
remains
of
all
the
family
meals
alix
spending
an
additional
at
the
table
while
she
cut
cold
biscuits
and
vegetables
into
small
pieces
for
her
gluttonous
pensioners
wait
for
the
ten
train
pete
and
go
in
with
cherry
said
alix
holding
a
small
piece
of
omelet
close
to
the
nose
of
the
importunate
buck
go
on
be
a
sport
do
you
dare
she
added
to
the
dog
who
rolled
restless
and
entreating
eyes
banged
his
tail
on
the
floor
and
allowed
a
faint
disconsolate
whimper
to
escape
him
i
do
think
i
go
in
she
explained
for
i
have
about
a
week
work
here
to
do
those
italian
boys
are
coming
up
to
thin
the
lettuce
and
kow
is
going
to
put
up
the
peaches
and
if
you
both
are
gone
i
can
have
a
regular
orgy
of
housekeeping
really
i
rather
here
take
it
the
dear
old
buckboy
well
did
he
get
so
mad
he
could
see
out
of
his
eyes
she
added
affectionately
to
buck
as
the
omelet
disappeared
with
one
snap
of
his
jaws
she
folded
his
two
fringed
ears
into
his
eyes
and
laid
her
face
against
his
shining
head
well
this
feeding
the
ducks
she
finished
jumping
up
come
see
them
pietro
they
too
darling
they
extremely
dirty
and
messy
peter
complained
following
with
cherry
nevertheless
to
see
her
scatter
her
chopped
food
carelessly
on
the
surface
of
the
little
pond
the
struggling
bodies
of
the
ducklings
and
the
bobbing
downy
heads
alike
with
quacking
and
wriggling
and
dabbling
the
meal
was
eaten
and
alix
scraping
the
bowls
for
last
fragments
and
blinking
in
a
flood
of
sunlight
laughed
exultantly
at
the
exhibition
peter
left
them
there
without
one
word
or
look
for
cherry
who
went
back
to
the
house
with
her
sister
in
a
most
agitated
and
wretched
state
of
mind
she
had
the
telephone
in
her
hand
to
cancel
the
engagement
with
her
dentist
when
alix
suddenly
consented
to
accompany
her
into
town
and
at
we
take
a
chance
on
the
francis
sis
alix
said
innocently
for
peter
almost
always
lunches
there
feeling
that
the
question
was
settled
yet
restless
and
unsatisfied
still
cherry
dressed
for
town
they
climbed
into
the
car
alix
firm
hands
in
yellow
chamois
gloves
sparched
at
the
wheel
the
die
was
cast
yet
at
the
station
another
change
of
plan
occurred
for
as
alix
brought
the
car
to
the
platform
anne
came
toward
them
from
the
arriving
train
a
gloved
and
demure
and
smiling
anne
anxious
she
explained
to
talk
over
this
newest
development
and
whether
it
proved
to
be
of
any
value
or
not
to
try
to
find
out
what
uncle
lee
had
really
wanted
for
them
all
and
then
agree
to
do
that
in
a
friendly
manner
out
of
court
alix
turned
from
the
wheel
to
face
cherry
in
the
back
seat
and
anne
leaned
on
the
door
of
the
tonneau
my
first
feeling
when
frenny
told
me
said
anne
chatting
pleasantly
in
the
shade
was
one
of
such
relief
for
i
had
wanted
all
that
money
one
bit
she
confessed
gaily
i
only
wanted
to
do
what
was
fair
only
two
or
three
nights
ago
i
said
to
frenny
that
it
really
belonged
to
us
all
and
last
night
we
talked
and
talked
about
it
and
the
result
was
that
i
said
that
i
must
see
the
girls
we
three
are
the
only
ones
concerned
after
all
and
anne
old
and
manner
was
unchanged
what
we
decide
is
what
really
matters
she
finished
why
there
is
no
question
that
it
daddy
handwriting
cherry
said
with
what
for
her
was
sharpness
and
it
seems
to
me
it
seems
to
me
anne
she
added
hesitatingly
that
you
have
a
nerve
alix
finished
not
with
any
particular
venom
that
document
throws
the
case
out
of
court
she
said
flatly
peter
is
confident
of
that
anne
pale
face
flushed
a
trifle
and
her
eyes
narrowed
yes
but
it
does
throw
the
will
out
of
court
she
said
quickly
you
proposed
to
break
the
will
alix
reminded
her
getting
angry
i
know
i
did
but
it
might
be
valid
after
all
and
under
that
will
i
inherit
only
a
fifth
less
than
you
and
cherry
anne
answered
also
with
feeling
that
just
what
i
came
over
to
talk
about
she
added
still
smiling
is
it
better
and
all
friendliness
and
appeal
were
in
her
voice
is
it
better
to
do
it
all
in
a
kindly
manner
than
to
fight
about
it
why
we
can
easily
settle
it
among
ourselves
she
assured
them
sensibly
alix
shrugged
and
looked
down
at
the
wheel
of
her
car
with
a
doubtful
shake
of
her
head
cherry
now
standing
beside
it
on
the
platform
was
flushed
and
uncomfortable
there
was
an
awkward
pause
board
shouted
a
trainman
with
a
rising
inflection
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
in
a
panic
of
haste
i
ca
leave
this
car
here
alix
exclaimed
i
got
to
park
her
and
lock
her
and
everything
run
get
on
board
cherry
i
do
have
to
go
in
anyway
you
got
a
date
cherry
heart
leaped
sank
coldly
and
leaped
again
as
with
a
swift
nod
of
parting
she
hurried
for
her
train
the
other
two
women
watched
her
with
forced
interest
as
she
climbed
on
board
and
as
the
train
slipped
noiselessly
out
of
sight
it
curved
among
the
redwoods
and
was
gone
before
either
spoke
again
then
as
her
eyes
met
anne
friendly
questioning
smile
alix
said
awkwardly
i
think
the
only
thing
to
do
is
for
you
and
justin
to
take
this
up
with
peter
anne
i
mean
i
mean
that
you
were
the
ones
who
proposed
to
bring
it
into
court
in
the
first
place
and
and
i
do
understand
much
about
it
alix
do
let
talk
in
a
cold
hard
legal
way
anne
pleaded
she
had
gotten
into
the
back
seat
and
was
leaning
on
the
front
seat
in
an
informal
sort
of
way
let
just
try
to
get
each
other
point
of
view
she
suggested
the
idea
is
that
uncle
lee
wanted
all
his
girls
to
inherit
alike
that
idea
did
seem
to
impress
you
much
a
week
ago
alix
said
glad
to
feel
herself
getting
angry
my
dear
i
was
going
to
divide
it
to
the
last
penny
anne
assured
her
widening
her
eyes
alix
was
silent
but
the
silence
shouted
her
unbelief
truly
i
was
anne
went
on
this
this
discovery
only
complicates
matters
why
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
dear
uncle
lee
would
wish
would
be
to
have
us
drag
the
family
name
into
a
you
and
justin
began
it
alix
reminded
her
goaded
into
reluctant
speech
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
a
favourite
phrase
of
anne
but
it
was
peter
who
said
he
would
fight
well
because
you
made
the
claim
alix
hating
herself
for
being
betrayed
into
argument
said
hotly
but
i
wo
talk
about
it
anne
she
added
firmly
and
as
far
as
coming
to
any
agreement
with
me
is
concerned
you
might
just
as
well
have
gone
back
on
the
train
with
cherry
i
hate
to
talk
this
way
but
we
all
think
you
acted
very
well
very
meanly
alix
finished
rather
flatly
perhaps
it
just
as
well
to
understand
each
other
anne
said
with
hot
cheeks
they
exchanged
a
few
more
sentences
wasted
words
and
angry
ones
and
then
anne
walked
over
to
a
seat
in
the
shade
to
wait
for
another
train
and
alix
with
her
heart
beating
hard
and
her
colour
high
drove
at
mad
speed
back
to
the
mountain
cabin
i
did
ask
her
to
lunch
i
do
care
alix
said
to
herself
in
agitation
she
and
justin
know
they
beaten
they
just
trying
to
patch
it
up
before
it
too
late
i
do
care
i
wo
have
her
think
she
can
get
away
with
any
such
scheme
and
so
muttering
and
scolding
alix
got
back
to
her
dog
and
her
barnyard
and
soothed
herself
with
great
hosing
and
cleaning
of
the
and
much
skimming
and
tasting
of
kow
preserves
after
all
she
had
grudged
this
perfect
summer
day
to
the
city
and
she
was
always
happiest
here
in
the
solitude
of
the
high
mountain
chapter
xv
meanwhile
cherry
in
the
sick
flutter
of
spirits
that
had
become
familiar
to
her
of
late
kept
her
dentist
appointment
and
at
noon
looked
at
a
flushed
and
lovely
vision
of
herself
in
the
mirror
doctor
has
given
me
red
lips
said
cherry
trembling
and
trying
to
smile
to
the
nurse
in
attendance
i
guess
the
good
lord
gave
you
your
looks
miss
maloney
said
generously
you
the
to
be
married
she
added
i
said
to
my
sister
last
week
lady
has
been
married
nearly
six
years
she
said
little
girl
of
eighteen
why
why
do
you
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
at
the
cherry
said
suddenly
pushing
up
the
golden
hair
under
her
hat
i
love
it
miss
maloney
said
appreciatively
but
doctor
has
a
one
appointment
after
this
one
and
i
sha
get
a
bite
until
nearly
three
i
got
crackers
here
cherry
went
out
into
the
blazing
street
it
was
one
of
the
hot
noontides
of
the
year
at
two
a
wild
wind
would
spring
up
and
send
papers
and
dust
flying
but
just
now
the
heat
was
dry
and
clear
and
still
she
was
carrying
a
parasol
and
she
opened
it
now
and
walked
slowly
toward
geary
street
she
could
go
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
salad
at
the
pheasant
she
could
go
to
the
pheasant
but
she
made
not
the
slightest
effort
to
go
there
beyond
saying
the
words
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
she
could
not
even
frame
in
her
thoughts
the
utter
blankness
of
the
feeling
that
swept
over
her
at
missing
an
opportunity
to
see
peter
she
turned
and
went
slowly
up
past
the
big
shop
windows
that
reflected
the
burning
plaza
and
so
came
to
the
cool
great
doorway
of
the
francis
inside
was
tempered
light
and
much
noiseless
coming
and
going
meeting
and
parting
chinese
boys
in
plum
colour
and
pale
blue
went
about
with
dustpans
gathering
fallen
cigar
and
cigarette
ashes
a
pleasant
traffic
in
magazines
and
cigarettes
and
candy
and
flowers
was
incessant
back
in
the
dim
wide
passageways
cherry
drifted
into
the
big
there
were
other
women
there
sunk
into
the
big
leather
chairs
watching
the
doors
and
glancing
at
the
clock
the
high
windows
gave
directly
upon
powell
street
where
were
grating
to
and
fro
and
where
honked
but
all
noises
were
filtered
here
to
a
sort
of
monotone
and
the
effect
of
the
room
was
of
silence
when
a
man
came
hastily
in
the
door
one
woman
rose
there
was
a
significant
smile
a
murmured
greeting
before
the
two
vanished
in
a
luxurious
chair
cherry
waited
peter
certainly
would
not
come
in
until
twelve
perhaps
not
then
long
before
that
time
she
might
decide
to
go
away
meanwhile
this
was
a
pleasant
and
restful
place
to
be
it
was
cool
in
here
and
the
murmuring
and
waiting
women
left
in
the
air
the
delicate
scents
of
perfumes
and
of
the
flowers
they
wore
suddenly
with
a
spring
of
her
heart
against
her
ribs
she
saw
dark
head
with
its
touches
of
iron
gray
groomed
and
brushed
scrupulously
as
always
with
the
little
limp
yet
as
always
dignified
and
erect
he
came
to
stand
before
her
and
she
stood
up
and
their
hands
met
flushed
and
a
little
confused
she
followed
him
to
an
inconspicuous
table
in
a
corner
of
the
dining
room
then
the
dreamlike
unreality
and
beauty
of
their
hours
together
began
again
cherry
felt
adjusted
untrammelled
at
ease
she
felt
that
all
the
uncomfortable
sensations
of
the
past
two
hours
were
absurd
forgotten
did
you
expect
me
to
meet
you
she
smiled
for
answer
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
a
minute
before
his
own
face
lighted
with
a
bright
smile
i
do
think
i
thought
of
your
not
being
there
he
confessed
i
was
simply
moving
all
morning
toward
the
instant
of
meeting
i
had
a
mental
picture
of
you
always
before
my
eyes
and
when
you
stood
up
there
it
was
just
my
picture
come
real
if
this
is
real
she
said
musingly
sometimes
my
thoughts
get
so
so
mixed
she
added
that
i
feel
as
if
alix
and
the
valley
and
martin
especially
were
all
a
dream
and
this
the
true
thing
i
know
how
you
feel
peter
answered
he
watched
her
almost
with
anxiety
for
a
moment
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
bill
of
fare
but
cherry
was
not
hungry
and
she
paid
small
attention
to
the
order
or
to
the
food
when
it
came
presently
they
were
talking
again
in
that
hunger
for
that
is
a
part
of
new
love
they
thrilled
at
every
word
cherry
raising
her
eyes
shining
with
eagerness
to
his
or
peter
watching
the
little
face
in
an
agony
of
adoration
an
hour
passed
two
hours
after
awhile
they
were
walking
still
with
that
strange
sense
of
oneness
and
of
solitude
and
still
as
easily
as
if
they
had
been
floating
to
the
ferry
alix
met
them
in
mill
valley
with
vivid
accounts
of
the
day
she
had
been
pondering
the
brief
talk
with
anne
and
was
anxious
to
have
peter
view
of
it
peter
was
of
the
opinion
that
anne
conduct
indicated
very
clearly
that
she
and
justin
realized
that
their
case
was
lost
then
you
fixed
for
life
cherry
was
alix
first
remark
oh
say
she
added
in
a
burst
let
go
down
to
the
old
house
will
you
let
see
what
it
needs
and
how
much
would
have
to
be
done
to
make
it
fit
to
live
in
cherry
flushed
staring
steadily
at
her
sister
and
peter
too
was
confused
but
alix
saw
nothing
the
next
day
she
carried
her
point
and
took
them
with
her
down
to
the
old
house
it
had
stood
empty
since
her
marriage
for
winter
storms
had
gone
hard
with
it
and
the
small
rent
it
would
have
brought
them
through
the
summer
months
was
not
enough
to
warrant
the
expense
of
putting
it
in
order
it
looked
neglected
and
shabby
it
was
almost
buried
in
the
dry
of
the
untended
garden
there
was
a
drift
of
colourless
leaves
on
the
porch
the
steps
were
deep
in
the
dropped
needles
of
the
redwoods
the
paths
were
quite
lost
to
sight
under
a
fine
wash
of
winter
mud
and
the
roses
and
lilacs
were
grown
woody
and
wild
alix
was
suddenly
silent
and
cherry
was
pale
and
fighting
tears
as
they
crossed
the
porch
and
fitted
the
key
in
the
door
inside
the
house
the
air
was
close
and
stale
odorous
of
dry
pine
walls
and
of
unaired
rooms
peter
flung
up
a
window
the
girls
walked
aimlessly
about
through
the
familiar
yet
shockingly
strange
chairs
and
table
that
were
all
coated
thickly
with
dust
somehow
this
dust
gave
cherry
a
desolate
sensation
it
covered
everything
alike
the
spectacle
case
and
the
newspaper
that
still
lay
on
her
father
desk
the
cups
and
glasses
that
remained
face
downward
at
the
sink
from
some
last
meal
her
hands
and
alix
were
speedily
coated
with
it
too
they
felt
sad
and
unnatural
here
in
the
house
where
they
had
spent
so
many
years
it
needs
everything
alix
said
after
a
first
quick
tour
of
inspection
eyeing
a
great
weather
streak
on
the
raw
plaster
of
the
wall
it
needs
air
cleaning
straightening
flowers
how
it
does
need
people
i
i
ca
bear
it
cherry
said
softly
in
a
sick
undertone
alix
who
was
rapidly
recovering
her
equilibrium
sprang
upstairs
without
hearing
her
but
cherry
did
not
follow
she
went
to
the
open
front
doorway
and
stood
there
leaning
against
the
sill
and
gazing
sadly
out
at
the
shabby
tangled
garden
that
had
sheltered
all
the
safety
and
joy
and
innocence
of
her
little
girl
days
peter
she
said
as
he
came
to
stand
beside
her
i
so
unhappy
i
sorry
he
said
simply
i
ca
i
ca
ever
be
here
cherry
at
least
i
ca
until
some
day
years
from
now
years
from
now
when
you
and
i
have
forgotten
i
never
shall
forget
he
said
and
after
awhile
he
added
shall
you
no
she
whispered
her
eyes
brimming
until
the
dry
and
dusty
green
of
the
garden
swam
before
her
cherry
will
you
end
it
he
asked
her
huskily
she
gave
him
a
startled
look
end
it
she
faltered
will
you
do
you
think
you
are
brave
enough
to
give
everything
else
up
for
me
he
asked
peter
said
cherry
hardly
above
a
breath
will
you
go
away
with
me
peter
went
on
feverishly
that
the
only
way
now
that
the
only
way
now
will
you
go
away
go
away
cherry
face
was
ashen
as
she
moved
her
tragic
and
beautiful
eyes
to
his
go
away
where
anywhere
peter
answered
confusedly
anywhere
he
did
not
meet
her
look
his
own
went
furtively
about
the
garden
immediately
he
seemed
to
regain
i
talking
like
a
fool
he
said
quickly
i
do
know
what
i
saying
half
the
time
i
sorry
i
sorry
cherry
do
mind
me
say
that
you
forgive
me
for
what
i
said
he
had
taken
her
hands
and
they
were
looking
distressedly
and
soberly
at
each
other
when
an
unexpected
noise
made
them
step
quickly
apart
cherry
heart
beat
madly
with
terror
and
peter
flushed
deeply
it
was
martin
lloyd
aunt
north
their
old
neighbour
who
came
about
the
corner
of
the
house
and
approached
them
smilingly
how
much
had
she
seen
cherry
asked
herself
in
a
panic
what
were
they
doing
what
were
they
saying
as
she
appeared
how
much
had
their
attitude
betrayed
them
north
was
the
same
cheerful
woman
as
of
old
she
had
moved
to
portland
to
be
near
martin
mother
some
years
before
and
was
delighted
with
the
chance
that
had
brought
her
back
to
the
valley
on
the
very
day
that
brought
the
strickland
girls
back
to
the
old
house
she
kissed
cherry
and
was
full
of
queries
for
martin
durango
belle
told
me
something
about
his
going
there
she
said
is
he
the
wandering
ayrab
and
ai
you
the
little
wife
to
follow
him
about
everywhere
how
long
you
been
here
cherry
i
been
with
alix
and
peter
for
for
several
weeks
cherry
said
uneasily
her
eyes
met
peter
and
he
conveyed
reassurance
to
her
with
a
look
when
you
going
back
dear
north
asked
with
so
shrewd
a
glance
from
cherry
exquisite
rosy
face
to
peter
that
he
felt
a
fresh
pang
of
suspicion
she
had
seen
something
why
i
been
rather
rather
kept
here
by
the
the
i
peter
cherry
explained
but
i
expect
to
go
as
soon
as
it
all
settled
here
alix
she
said
gladly
as
alix
came
downstairs
with
an
old
kodak
album
in
her
hands
look
cherry
i
forgotten
this
alix
said
in
deep
amusement
holding
out
the
book
but
she
immediately
put
it
aside
to
greet
the
old
friend
i
bet
you
three
are
having
real
good
times
north
said
with
a
curious
look
from
one
to
the
other
you
know
what
i
hope
alix
told
her
is
that
cherry
and
martin
will
always
keep
the
old
place
open
now
they
could
get
a
chinese
boy
for
very
little
to
keep
it
in
order
and
then
you
see
with
all
moving
about
she
always
have
headquarters
here
and
i
do
believe
cherry
ever
love
another
place
as
she
does
the
valley
will
you
sis
alix
ended
eagerly
cherry
met
the
arm
her
sister
linked
around
her
and
gave
her
a
troubled
smile
and
yet
a
few
moments
later
when
some
quest
took
peter
suddenly
from
the
group
she
watched
the
shabby
corduroy
suit
the
laced
high
boots
and
the
black
head
touched
with
gray
disappear
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
with
a
tearing
pain
at
her
heart
and
the
words
the
other
women
were
saying
hummed
without
meaning
in
her
ears
when
you
three
girls
got
started
you
all
went
off
together
north
commented
i
used
to
say
i
thought
you
girls
never
would
marry
you
never
seemed
to
take
much
interest
in
the
men
i
never
thought
we
marry
alix
agreed
pleasantly
did
you
kirschwasser
i
do
think
i
ever
thought
about
it
much
cherry
said
rousing
herself
from
a
musing
mood
according
to
age
alix
pursued
in
one
of
her
absurdly
argumentative
moments
anne
should
have
married
peter
cherry
justin
and
i
martin
but
the
truth
is
we
did
seem
to
give
the
matter
sufficient
thought
girls
never
do
it
is
expected
north
said
with
her
indulgent
laugh
as
they
followed
peter
into
the
empty
kitchen
which
smelled
of
dry
woods
and
drains
dust
was
thick
on
hong
range
and
one
of
his
old
white
aprons
was
flung
limply
across
a
chair
eyes
were
thoughtful
filled
with
a
look
of
pain
it
was
true
girls
did
think
anything
about
it
it
was
expected
of
them
and
yet
in
these
very
rooms
her
father
had
urged
her
to
consider
consideration
simply
was
in
that
little
head
of
hers
in
those
days
words
seemed
to
have
no
meaning
or
were
transmuted
into
different
meanings
by
martin
lloyd
voice
her
father
had
asked
her
to
wait
wait
until
she
was
nineteen
nineteen
had
seemed
old
then
she
had
felt
that
at
nineteen
she
would
have
merely
delayed
the
great
joy
of
life
for
nothing
at
nineteen
she
would
be
only
so
much
older
so
much
more
desperately
bent
upon
this
marriage
and
peter
was
there
then
was
coming
and
going
advising
and
teasing
her
so
near
so
accessible
loving
her
even
then
had
she
but
known
it
that
engagement
might
as
easily
and
how
much
more
wisely
have
been
with
peter
the
presents
the
gowns
the
wedding
would
have
been
the
same
to
her
childish
egotism
the
rest
how
different
the
rest
would
have
been
light
instead
of
darkness
joy
instead
of
pain
dignity
and
development
and
increasing
content
instead
of
all
the
months
of
restless
criticism
and
doubt
and
disillusionment
the
very
scene
here
with
north
and
alix
might
easily
have
been
with
cherry
as
the
wife
of
peter
cherry
as
her
sister
hostess
in
the
mountain
cabin
at
the
thought
her
heart
suffocated
her
she
stood
dazedly
looking
out
of
the
old
kitchen
window
and
her
senses
swam
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
pain
and
alix
well
alix
might
have
been
lloyd
martin
had
told
her
more
than
once
that
he
had
a
crush
on
alix
right
off
the
bat
and
alix
had
liked
him
too
any
girl
would
like
any
man
under
the
same
circumstances
of
age
and
environment
alix
would
have
made
martin
a
better
wife
she
would
have
loved
the
mining
towns
the
muddy
railroad
stations
and
the
odd
women
she
would
have
had
her
dogs
perhaps
a
child
or
two
now
anyway
ran
cherry
thoughts
she
would
have
had
the
old
home
now
and
that
to
alix
would
have
meant
a
very
triumph
of
joy
she
would
have
come
to
stay
with
peter
and
cherry
while
it
was
put
in
order
she
would
have
revelled
in
cows
and
ducks
and
dogs
here
cherry
child
come
and
lend
us
a
hand
peter
said
they
were
trying
to
push
aside
the
that
blocked
the
unlocked
kitchen
door
cherry
went
to
them
at
once
the
little
word
child
danced
in
her
heart
all
day
and
warmed
it
when
she
was
lying
wakeful
and
restless
deep
into
the
summer
night
chapter
xvi
you
and
i
must
go
away
said
peter
i
ca
stand
it
i
love
you
i
love
you
so
dearly
cherry
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
any
more
it
like
a
fever
it
like
a
sickness
i
never
happy
any
more
unless
my
arms
are
about
you
will
you
let
me
take
you
somewhere
where
we
can
be
happy
together
cherry
turned
her
confident
childish
face
toward
him
her
lashes
glittered
but
she
smiled
i
love
you
peter
she
said
and
the
words
sounding
softly
through
the
silence
of
the
garden
died
away
on
the
warm
night
air
like
music
it
was
night
the
third
night
of
the
harvest
moon
through
the
branches
of
the
oak
tree
under
which
they
were
sitting
blots
of
silver
were
falling
between
them
the
shadows
were
inky
black
the
grass
was
a
sheen
of
pearly
light
the
little
cabin
was
like
an
enchanted
dwelling
wreathed
with
flowers
and
steeped
in
moonshine
toward
the
ocean
over
the
ridge
a
great
fold
of
creamy
fog
was
silently
pushing
and
cherry
had
a
scarf
of
creamy
lace
caught
about
her
shoulders
her
coil
of
hair
was
loosened
she
and
peter
had
been
moving
geranium
slips
all
afternoon
and
at
when
a
telephone
message
from
alix
had
advised
them
that
she
was
obliged
to
stay
in
town
to
dine
with
an
exacting
old
family
friend
they
had
parted
only
to
bathe
and
change
before
sitting
down
for
dinner
in
the
sunset
beauty
of
the
porch
it
had
been
a
memorable
meal
an
hour
always
to
have
its
place
in
their
hearts
in
the
two
weeks
since
the
day
at
the
old
house
they
had
not
chanced
to
be
often
alone
and
for
the
first
time
cherry
admitted
that
she
could
fight
no
longer
a
few
days
before
she
had
again
gone
to
the
dentist
and
again
had
waited
for
peter
at
the
great
hotel
but
on
this
occasion
he
had
not
known
of
her
engagement
in
town
and
had
lunched
elsewhere
so
that
cherry
had
waited
growing
weary
headachy
and
heartsick
as
the
slow
moments
went
their
way
peter
happening
to
telephone
to
alix
at
about
two
had
learned
that
cherry
was
in
the
city
and
hanging
up
the
receiver
had
sat
wrapped
in
agitated
thought
for
a
few
minutes
before
rushing
to
the
hotel
on
the
desperate
hazard
of
finding
her
there
the
sight
of
the
little
patient
figure
the
irradiation
of
her
face
as
they
met
the
ecstasy
of
delight
with
which
their
hands
were
joined
and
the
flood
of
joy
in
their
hearts
as
he
took
her
to
tea
was
illuminating
to
them
both
cherry
had
spent
two
long
hours
waiting
only
for
the
sight
of
that
eager
limping
form
and
peter
had
experienced
enough
anguish
as
he
sped
to
find
her
to
tear
the
last
deception
away
they
talked
as
lovers
his
arm
about
the
soft
little
clinging
figure
her
small
firm
fingers
tight
in
his
own
he
had
squared
about
on
the
great
log
that
was
their
seat
so
that
his
ardent
eyes
were
closer
to
her
the
world
held
nothing
but
themselves
it
was
eight
so
this
is
the
thing
that
was
waiting
for
us
all
these
years
cherry
ever
since
the
time
you
and
alix
used
to
dam
my
brook
and
climb
my
oak
trees
i
never
dreamed
of
it
cherry
said
with
wonder
in
her
tone
if
we
had
dreamed
of
it
peter
began
and
stopped
ah
if
we
had
it
would
all
be
different
cherry
said
with
a
look
of
pain
that
the
one
thing
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
what
is
he
asked
watching
the
lovely
face
that
was
only
dimly
visible
in
the
moonlight
oh
that
it
all
might
have
been
so
simple
so
easy
and
right
the
girl
answered
that
we
might
have
been
so
happy
instead
of
so
sad
it
makes
you
sad
dear
peter
how
could
it
make
me
anything
else
why
what
can
come
of
it
cherry
asked
sorrowfully
i
can
not
stay
on
here
now
i
can
not
she
freed
herself
from
his
arms
and
walked
away
from
him
restlessly
through
the
moonshine
twisting
her
arms
above
her
head
i
can
not
go
back
to
martin
he
heard
her
whisper
in
an
agony
i
ca
leave
you
i
ca
leave
you
shall
we
go
away
peter
asked
simply
when
she
stopped
at
the
great
stone
that
alix
for
the
view
it
commanded
had
christened
sunrise
rock
cherry
dropped
down
upon
it
facing
away
from
him
across
the
soft
green
luminous
light
of
the
valley
go
where
she
asked
go
anywhere
he
answered
we
have
money
enough
we
can
leave
alix
rich
she
will
still
have
her
cabin
and
her
dogs
and
the
life
she
loves
but
there
are
other
tiny
places
cherry
there
are
little
cabins
in
hawaii
there
are
canadian
villages
cherry
there
are
thousands
of
places
in
the
south
of
france
where
we
might
live
for
years
and
never
be
questioned
and
never
be
annoyed
france
she
whispered
and
the
downcast
face
he
was
watching
so
eagerly
was
thoughtful
how
could
we
go
she
breathed
you
first
and
then
i
to
meet
somewhere
we
would
have
to
go
together
he
decided
swiftly
everyone
must
know
dear
you
realize
that
she
was
staring
at
him
as
if
spellbound
by
some
new
hope
now
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
careless
disdain
that
is
of
any
consequence
you
do
feel
it
so
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
again
they
locked
hands
not
that
part
she
answered
simply
i
mind
alix
she
added
thoughtfully
yes
i
mind
alix
he
admitted
but
the
injury
is
done
to
alix
now
cherry
said
slowly
now
it
is
too
late
to
go
back
you
and
i
could
we
could
deceive
alix
here
peter
cherry
added
and
as
she
turned
to
him
he
saw
her
thin
white
blouse
move
suddenly
with
the
quick
rising
of
her
heart
that
that
would
be
too
horrible
but
i
could
take
this
love
of
ours
away
leave
everything
else
behind
simply
simply
recognize
stammered
cherry
her
lips
beginning
to
tremble
that
it
is
bigger
than
ourselves
that
we
ca
help
it
peter
i
fight
it
if
i
could
she
added
piteously
i
go
away
if
i
did
know
that
no
power
on
earth
could
keep
me
from
coming
back
she
buried
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
there
was
utter
silence
over
the
great
brooding
mountain
and
in
the
valley
brimming
with
soft
moonshine
and
in
the
garden
i
believe
that
even
alix
will
understand
peter
said
after
awhile
she
loves
you
and
me
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
she
is
not
only
everything
that
is
generous
but
she
is
selfish
she
is
the
busiest
and
the
most
sensible
person
i
ever
knew
i
know
of
course
i
know
it
rotten
he
broke
off
in
sudden
despair
but
what
i
trying
to
say
is
that
alix
of
all
people
i
know
is
the
one
that
will
make
the
least
fuss
about
it
cherry
was
staring
raptly
before
her
now
she
grasped
his
hand
and
said
breathlessly
oh
peter
are
we
talking
about
it
are
we
talking
about
our
going
away
and
belonging
to
each
other
what
else
he
said
quick
tears
in
his
eyes
oh
but
i
been
so
unhappy
i
been
so
starved
she
whispered
i
thought
i
wanted
people
cities
i
thought
i
wanted
to
go
on
the
stage
but
it
was
only
you
that
i
wanted
oh
peter
what
a
life
it
will
be
the
littlest
cottage
the
simplest
life
and
perhaps
a
beach
or
woods
to
walk
in
and
always
talking
reading
always
together
i
never
want
to
come
back
i
never
want
to
see
any
one
i
never
want
anything
but
that
france
it
must
be
i
think
he
said
for
then
we
can
go
about
no
one
will
know
us
but
we
will
meet
people
we
know
in
the
trains
going
cherry
said
suddenly
i
know
what
i
am
doing
she
added
but
that
would
be
so
hard
to
have
them
identify
us
perhaps
come
up
to
us
whisper
and
point
but
why
not
go
by
sea
he
mused
why
not
to
japan
and
through
india
and
so
on
to
france
no
she
said
quickly
on
a
long
someone
would
surely
know
us
is
there
some
way
we
can
get
away
disappear
as
if
we
had
never
been
cherry
he
said
kneeling
before
her
in
the
wet
grass
you
know
what
it
means
it
means
you
she
answered
after
a
silence
she
had
laid
her
hands
softly
about
his
neck
and
her
shining
eyes
were
close
to
his
and
you
trust
me
he
whispered
you
know
that
when
i
am
free
and
you
are
free
she
put
her
fingers
over
his
mouth
peter
have
i
known
you
ever
since
i
was
little
enough
to
sit
in
your
lap
and
have
you
read
jane
to
me
it
so
beautiful
so
wonderful
to
love
this
way
she
said
in
her
innocent
voice
that
it
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
in
the
world
i
come
to
you
peter
if
it
meant
shame
and
death
and
horror
it
does
mean
that
it
only
means
a
man
and
a
woman
settling
down
somewhere
in
the
south
of
france
a
big
quiet
man
who
limps
a
little
and
a
little
woman
in
blue
smocks
and
hats
it
means
life
of
course
he
interrupted
her
the
hour
that
makes
you
mine
cherry
will
be
the
exquisite
hour
of
my
whole
life
they
were
silent
for
a
while
and
below
them
the
white
moonlight
deepened
and
brightened
and
swam
like
an
enchantment
if
you
will
face
it
peter
said
presently
i
will
give
every
instant
of
my
life
to
you
i
know
you
will
she
said
dreamily
there
will
be
no
coming
back
cherry
oh
i
know
that
there
ca
ever
be
there
must
be
you
thought
of
that
he
said
uncertainly
in
the
curious
unreal
light
that
flooded
the
world
he
saw
her
turn
and
caught
the
gleam
of
her
surprised
eyes
you
mean
children
a
child
she
said
surprisedly
why
not
peter
she
added
tightening
her
fingers
what
could
be
more
wonderful
than
that
we
should
have
a
child
can
you
imagine
a
happier
environment
for
a
child
than
that
little
sunshiny
woodsy
beach
cottage
ca
you
see
the
little
figure
the
two
or
three
little
figures
scampering
ahead
of
us
through
the
country
roads
or
around
the
fire
oh
i
can
said
cherry
her
extraordinary
voice
rich
and
sweet
with
longing
i
can
that
would
be
motherhood
peter
that
would
be
like
having
a
baby
whose
father
one
did
one
could
love
marriage
or
no
marriage
and
as
he
watched
amazed
at
the
change
that
love
had
brought
to
quiet
little
inarticulate
cherry
she
added
earnestly
i
been
thinking
how
bitter
it
was
peter
to
have
the
greatest
thing
in
life
come
to
us
this
way
but
just
lately
just
this
last
hour
it
come
to
me
that
it
is
right
it
best
to
have
it
so
we
give
all
the
world
up
and
we
get
only
each
other
and
yet
how
little
it
seems
to
give
and
how
much
to
get
why
every
hour
of
it
every
minute
will
hold
more
joy
than
we
ever
known
i
could
she
said
suddenly
grave
i
could
take
you
from
any
one
who
loved
you
as
i
do
i
could
hurt
any
one
to
be
happy
but
alix
will
forgive
us
you
see
she
will
alix
i
know
her
will
only
be
sorry
for
me
cherry
mused
only
think
me
mad
to
disgrace
the
good
name
of
strickland
she
think
we
both
crazy
perhaps
she
plunge
into
the
orphanage
work
or
perhaps
she
go
on
here
gardening
playing
with
buck
raising
ducks
she
says
herself
that
she
has
never
known
what
love
means
says
it
really
meaning
it
yet
as
if
the
whole
subject
was
a
joke
a
weakness
i
believe
she
will
forgive
us
for
she
is
the
most
generous
woman
in
the
world
peter
said
slowly
anyway
we
ca
stop
now
we
stop
now
it
will
take
me
only
a
few
days
now
to
close
everything
up
to
arrange
matters
so
that
she
shall
have
plenty
of
money
and
so
that
i
can
carry
on
the
affairs
of
my
mother
estate
at
long
range
spencer
will
attend
to
the
rents
mail
me
quarterly
checks
the
whole
thing
is
simple
and
i
will
let
you
know
it
all
seems
so
unreal
cherry
said
with
her
heart
beginning
to
hammer
with
excitement
it
does
seem
as
if
it
was
you
and
me
peter
i
shall
not
need
a
trunk
i
shall
buy
new
things
it
will
be
a
new
life
there
is
the
steamer
line
that
goes
to
los
angeles
peter
mused
yes
i
believe
that
is
the
solution
he
added
with
a
brightening
face
nobody
you
know
goes
there
on
it
it
leaves
daily
at
eleven
and
gets
into
los
angeles
the
following
morning
from
there
i
do
know
anybody
there
cherry
said
eagerly
you
would
see
anybody
anyway
from
there
we
can
get
a
to
new
orleans
that
only
a
day
and
a
half
more
and
we
can
keep
to
ourselves
if
by
any
unlucky
chance
there
should
be
any
one
we
know
on
the
train
which
is
likely
which
is
likely
then
at
new
orleans
we
go
either
to
the
zone
or
to
south
america
or
to
any
one
of
the
thousand
places
new
york
if
we
like
by
water
by
that
time
we
will
be
lost
as
completely
as
if
we
had
dropped
into
the
sea
i
see
about
reservations
the
thing
is
too
pretty
to
go
quite
unnoticed
he
added
ruefully
he
saw
a
smile
flicker
on
her
face
in
the
moonlight
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
almost
tearful
gravity
you
arrange
it
peter
and
somehow
i
go
i
write
alix
i
tell
her
that
where
she
sane
i
mad
and
where
she
strong
i
weak
and
we
weather
it
dear
and
we
find
ourselves
somewhere
alone
with
all
the
golden
beautiful
future
before
us
but
peter
until
this
part
of
it
over
we
must
be
alone
again
you
must
kiss
me
again
will
you
promise
me
as
stirred
as
she
was
he
gathered
her
little
fingers
together
and
kissed
them
i
promise
anything
i
make
it
up
to
you
cherry
said
with
a
sort
of
feverish
weariness
i
all
confused
and
frightened
now
i
only
want
it
somehow
somehow
to
be
over
i
want
you
to
take
me
away
somewhere
she
whispered
with
the
hands
he
was
clasping
resting
on
his
breast
and
her
flowerlike
face
raised
to
his
take
me
somewhere
and
take
care
of
me
i
only
want
you
cherry
my
darling
my
dearest
peter
said
i
will
take
care
of
you
only
trust
me
for
a
few
days
more
and
we
will
be
away
from
it
all
and
now
you
put
it
all
out
of
your
mind
and
run
in
and
go
to
bed
exhausted
and
if
alix
gets
the
eight
train
she
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
i
wander
down
the
road
a
little
way
and
meet
the
car
if
she
drives
it
up
she
breathed
and
he
saw
the
white
gown
flicker
against
the
soft
light
on
the
lawn
and
saw
the
black
shadow
creeping
by
it
before
she
mounted
the
porch
steps
and
was
gone
chapter
xvii
swept
along
by
a
passionate
excitement
that
seemed
actually
to
consume
her
cherry
lived
through
the
next
three
days
alix
noticed
her
mood
and
asked
her
more
than
once
what
caused
it
cherry
would
press
a
hot
cheek
to
hers
smile
with
eyes
full
of
pain
and
flutter
away
she
was
well
she
was
quite
all
right
only
she
she
was
afraid
martin
would
summon
her
soon
and
she
did
want
to
go
to
him
alix
was
puzzled
watching
her
sister
with
anxious
eyes
the
cleaning
and
refurnishing
of
the
old
home
was
proceeding
rapidly
and
alix
feared
that
the
constant
memory
of
the
old
times
would
be
too
much
for
cherry
she
tried
to
induce
her
to
rest
to
spend
this
morning
or
that
afternoon
in
the
hammock
but
cherry
gently
but
irresistibly
refused
her
one
hope
was
to
be
busy
to
tire
her
brain
and
body
before
night
suspecting
something
gravely
amiss
alix
tried
to
win
her
confidence
regarding
martin
but
briefly
quickly
and
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
and
apologetic
impatience
cherry
refused
to
discuss
him
i
shall
not
go
back
to
him
she
said
breathing
hard
and
with
the
air
of
being
more
absorbed
in
what
she
was
doing
than
what
she
was
saying
she
and
alix
were
dusting
the
books
in
their
father
old
library
and
arranging
them
on
the
shelves
on
a
quiet
september
morning
but
cherry
dear
you
were
saying
yesterday
that
you
dreaded
his
sending
for
you
alix
said
in
a
troubled
surprise
yes
i
know
i
was
cherry
admitted
quickly
but
did
you
mean
that
you
are
really
going
to
leave
him
the
older
sister
questioned
and
as
cherry
was
silent
she
repeated
are
you
going
to
leave
him
dear
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
cherry
half
sobbed
but
dearest
dearest
you
only
do
you
think
you
might
feel
better
about
it
as
time
goes
on
alix
urged
now
that
the
money
is
all
yours
cherry
and
you
can
have
this
nice
home
to
come
to
now
and
then
is
it
different
cherry
an
old
volume
in
her
hand
was
looking
at
her
steadily
you
do
understand
sis
she
said
i
understand
that
you
do
love
martin
alix
said
perplexed
but
ca
people
who
do
love
each
other
live
together
in
peace
she
added
with
a
half
smile
as
man
and
wife
cherry
stammered
alix
sat
back
on
her
heels
in
the
ungraceful
fashion
of
her
girlhood
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
think
of
the
people
who
are
worrying
themselves
sick
over
bills
or
sick
wives
or
children
to
bring
up
she
suggested
hopefully
my
lord
if
you
have
enough
money
and
food
and
are
young
and
well
yes
but
alix
cherry
argued
eagerly
i
not
well
when
unhappy
my
heart
is
like
lead
all
the
time
i
ca
seem
to
breathe
people
is
it
possible
that
people
are
different
about
that
she
asked
timidly
i
suppose
they
are
alix
conceded
thoughtfully
anyway
look
at
all
the
fusses
in
history
she
added
carelessly
of
grande
passions
and
murders
and
elopements
and
the
fate
of
nations
resting
on
just
the
fact
that
a
man
and
woman
hated
each
other
too
much
or
loved
each
other
too
much
there
must
be
something
in
it
that
i
do
understand
but
what
i
do
understand
she
added
after
a
moment
when
cherry
choked
with
emotion
was
silent
is
that
dad
would
die
of
grief
if
he
knew
you
were
unhappy
that
your
life
was
all
broken
up
in
disappointment
and
bitterness
but
is
that
my
fault
cherry
exclaimed
with
sudden
tears
alix
after
watching
her
for
a
troubled
minute
went
to
her
and
put
her
arm
about
her
do
cry
cherry
she
pleaded
sorrowfully
cherry
regaining
resumed
her
work
silently
with
an
occasional
sudden
sigh
alix
clapping
the
heavy
covers
of
a
leatherbound
volume
in
buck
inquisitive
nose
presently
laughed
gaily
as
he
sneezed
and
pawed
she
had
opened
the
subject
with
reluctance
now
she
realized
that
they
had
again
reached
a
blank
wall
three
days
after
their
talk
in
the
moonlit
garden
peter
found
chance
to
speak
alone
to
cherry
are
you
ready
he
asked
quite
she
said
raising
blue
eyes
to
his
what
about
your
suitcase
i
took
it
into
san
francisco
yesterday
alix
went
in
early
and
i
followed
at
noon
it
checked
in
the
ferry
building
waiting
it
then
cherry
he
said
he
saw
the
colour
ebb
from
her
face
as
she
echoed
him
this
was
already
late
afternoon
perhaps
her
thoughts
raced
ahead
to
afternoon
at
this
time
when
they
two
would
be
leaning
on
the
rail
of
the
little
steamer
gazing
out
over
the
smooth
boundless
blue
of
the
pacific
and
alone
in
the
world
you
will
be
mine
he
said
that
all
i
think
of
she
answered
and
now
the
colour
came
up
in
a
splendid
wave
of
flame
and
the
face
that
she
turned
toward
his
was
radiant
with
proud
surrender
he
told
her
the
number
of
the
dock
they
discussed
trains
we
sail
at
eleven
said
peter
but
i
shall
be
there
shortly
after
ten
i
have
the
baggage
on
board
everything
ready
you
only
have
to
cross
the
gangplank
you
have
your
baggage
check
give
it
to
me
they
were
waiting
in
the
car
while
alix
marketed
cherry
opened
her
purse
and
gave
him
the
punched
cardboard
i
tell
alix
that
i
have
a
last
dentist
appointment
at
ten
she
said
if
she
goes
in
with
me
we
go
to
the
very
door
but
she
says
she
ca
come
in
anyway
i
write
her
and
drop
the
letter
on
the
way
to
the
boat
better
wait
until
we
are
in
los
angeles
he
said
pondering
writing
too
of
course
i
simply
saying
that
it
is
one
of
the
big
things
that
come
into
people
lives
and
that
one
ca
combat
perhaps
some
day
but
i
ca
look
forward
i
ca
tell
what
the
future
holds
i
only
know
that
we
belong
to
each
other
and
that
life
might
as
well
be
ended
as
love
then
was
cherry
only
answer
i
glad
it
so
soon
said
cherry
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
car
to
kiss
her
sister
alix
received
the
kiss
smiled
and
stretched
in
the
sun
heavenly
day
to
waste
in
the
city
said
alix
i
know
cherry
said
nervously
she
had
been
so
strangely
nervous
and
distracted
in
manner
all
morning
that
alix
had
more
than
once
asked
her
if
there
was
anything
wrong
now
she
questioned
her
again
you
must
mind
me
cherry
said
with
a
laugh
i
desperately
unhappy
she
said
her
eyes
watering
and
sometimes
i
think
of
desperate
remedies
that
all
i
do
anything
in
the
world
to
help
you
cerise
alix
said
sympathetically
i
know
you
would
sis
i
believe
cherry
said
trembling
that
there
nothing
you
would
give
me
that
easily
said
alix
answered
carelessly
for
i
do
get
fond
of
things
as
you
do
my
dear
i
go
off
with
martin
to
mexico
in
a
minute
i
mean
it
i
do
care
a
whoop
where
i
live
if
only
people
are
happy
i
work
my
hands
to
the
bone
for
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
work
to
the
bone
she
added
laughing
as
she
looked
at
the
hands
that
were
stained
and
rough
from
gardening
how
about
buck
cherry
said
as
the
dog
leaped
to
his
place
on
the
front
seat
and
licked
his
mistress
ear
alix
embraced
him
lovingly
well
if
he
wanted
to
go
with
you
she
conceded
unwillingly
but
he
would
she
added
quickly
cherry
going
to
the
train
gave
her
an
april
smile
and
as
she
took
her
seat
and
the
train
drew
on
its
way
it
seemed
to
her
suddenly
that
she
might
indeed
meet
peter
but
it
would
only
be
to
tell
him
that
what
they
had
planned
was
impossible
but
on
the
deck
of
the
sausalito
steamer
dreaming
in
the
sunshine
of
the
soft
lazy
autumn
day
her
heart
turned
sick
with
longing
once
more
alix
was
forgotten
everything
was
forgotten
except
peter
his
voice
his
tall
figure
erect
yet
moving
with
the
little
limp
she
knew
so
well
came
to
her
thoughts
she
thought
of
herself
on
the
other
steamer
only
an
hour
from
now
safe
in
his
care
martin
forgotten
and
all
the
perplexities
and
disappointments
of
the
old
life
forgotten
in
the
flood
of
new
security
and
joy
los
angeles
new
orleans
france
it
mattered
not
where
they
wandered
they
might
well
lose
the
world
and
the
world
them
from
on
so
that
is
to
be
my
life
one
of
the
blamed
and
ignored
women
cherry
mused
leaning
on
the
rail
and
watching
the
plunge
of
the
receding
water
like
the
heroines
of
half
the
books
only
it
always
seemed
so
bold
and
so
frightful
in
books
but
to
me
it
just
seems
the
most
natural
thing
in
all
the
world
i
love
peter
and
he
loves
me
and
the
earth
is
big
enough
to
hide
us
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
anyway
right
or
wrong
i
ca
help
it
she
finished
rejoicing
to
find
herself
suddenly
serene
and
confident
as
the
boat
made
the
slip
and
the
passengers
streamed
downstairs
and
so
across
the
ferry
place
and
into
the
city
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
ten
a
warm
sweet
morning
with
great
hurrying
back
and
forth
at
the
ferry
women
climbing
to
the
open
seats
of
the
pinning
on
their
violets
or
roses
as
they
climbed
in
the
air
was
the
pleasant
mingling
of
the
scents
of
roasting
coffee
salt
and
softening
tar
in
the
paving
that
is
native
only
to
san
francisco
cars
clanged
about
the
circle
hummed
their
way
up
into
the
long
vista
of
market
street
disturbing
great
flights
of
gulls
that
were
picking
dropped
oats
from
the
very
feet
of
feeding
horses
cherry
sped
through
it
all
beside
herself
now
with
excitement
and
strain
only
anxious
to
have
the
great
hands
of
the
clock
drop
more
speedily
from
minute
to
minute
and
so
round
out
the
terrible
hour
that
joined
the
old
life
to
the
new
she
was
hurrying
blindly
toward
the
docks
of
the
los
angeles
line
absorbed
in
her
one
whirling
thought
when
somebody
touched
her
arm
and
a
voice
terrifyingly
unexpected
and
yet
familiar
addressed
her
and
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
arm
in
utter
confusion
she
looked
up
it
was
martin
who
had
stopped
her
chapter
xviii
for
a
few
dreadful
seconds
a
sort
of
vertigo
seized
cherry
and
she
was
unable
to
collect
her
thoughts
or
to
speak
even
the
most
casual
words
of
greeting
she
had
been
so
full
of
her
extraordinary
errand
that
she
was
bewildered
and
sick
at
its
interruption
her
heart
thundered
her
throat
was
choked
and
her
knees
shook
beneath
her
where
was
she
what
was
known
how
much
had
she
betrayed
her
thoughts
jumbled
together
in
a
tangle
of
horrified
questioning
gasping
trying
to
smile
she
looked
up
at
him
while
the
ferry
place
whirled
about
her
and
pulses
drummed
in
her
ears
she
had
automatically
given
him
her
hand
now
he
kissed
her
hello
cherry
where
you
going
for
the
third
time
i
came
into
town
to
shop
she
faltered
you
what
she
had
not
really
been
intelligible
and
she
felt
it
with
a
pang
of
fright
he
must
not
suspect
the
steamer
was
there
only
a
short
block
away
peter
might
pass
them
a
chance
word
might
be
fatal
he
must
not
suspect
i
shopping
she
said
distinctly
with
dry
lips
and
she
managed
to
smile
well
martin
said
smiling
in
turn
surprised
to
see
me
oh
martin
said
her
fluttered
voice
even
in
the
utter
panic
of
heart
and
soul
she
knew
that
for
safety
sake
she
must
find
his
vanity
i
going
to
tell
you
something
that
will
surprise
you
he
said
through
with
the
red
creek
people
martin
cherry
enunciated
almost
voicelessly
you
remember
i
wrote
you
that
they
fired
mason
and
that
i
was
doing
his
work
and
mine
too
i
i
remember
cherry
seized
by
deadly
nausea
and
chill
looked
from
a
flower
vendor
to
a
newsboy
looked
at
the
cars
the
people
she
must
not
faint
she
must
not
faint
well
but
where
are
you
going
home
i
was
going
to
the
dentist
a
minute
but
it
not
important
they
had
turned
and
were
walking
across
to
the
ferry
she
knew
that
there
was
no
way
in
which
she
might
escape
him
what
did
you
say
she
said
i
asked
you
when
the
next
boat
left
for
mill
valley
we
can
go
find
out
cherry
thoughts
were
spinning
she
must
warn
peter
somehow
it
was
twenty
minutes
of
eleven
by
the
ferry
clock
twenty
minutes
of
eleven
in
twenty
minutes
the
boat
would
sail
she
thought
desperately
of
the
women
upstairs
she
might
plead
the
necessity
of
telephoning
from
it
but
it
had
but
one
door
and
martin
would
wait
at
that
door
the
glow
of
meeting
had
already
faded
from
his
face
but
he
was
loitering
by
her
side
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
suddenly
she
realized
that
her
only
hope
of
warning
peter
was
to
send
a
messenger
but
if
martin
should
chance
to
connect
her
neighbourhood
with
the
boat
when
he
met
her
and
her
sending
of
a
message
to
peter
here
i
think
there
a
boat
at
eleven
something
she
said
collectedly
suppose
you
go
and
find
out
she
glanced
toward
the
entrance
of
the
sausalito
a
hundred
yards
away
and
a
mad
hope
leaped
in
her
heart
if
he
turned
his
back
on
her
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
somewhat
surprised
i
ought
to
telephone
alix
her
despair
lent
her
wit
if
he
went
to
the
ticket
office
and
she
into
a
telephone
booth
she
might
escape
him
yet
while
he
dawdled
here
minutes
were
flying
and
peter
was
watching
every
car
and
every
torn
with
the
same
agony
that
was
tearing
her
if
you
go
find
out
the
exact
time
and
get
tickets
she
said
i
telephone
alix
tickets
he
echoed
with
all
martin
old
maddening
slowness
have
you
got
a
return
ticket
i
have
mileage
she
blundered
oh
then
i
use
your
mileage
martin
said
telephone
he
added
nodding
toward
a
row
of
booths
no
hurry
we
got
piles
of
time
she
remembered
that
he
liked
a
masculine
assumption
of
easiness
where
all
trains
tickets
railroad
connections
and
transit
business
of
any
sort
were
concerned
he
liked
to
loiter
elaborately
while
other
people
were
running
liked
to
pull
out
his
big
watch
and
assure
her
that
they
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
she
tried
to
call
a
number
left
the
booth
paid
a
staring
girl
and
rejoined
him
busy
she
reported
i
was
just
thinking
martin
said
that
we
might
stay
in
town
and
go
to
the
orpheum
how
about
it
do
we
have
to
have
peter
and
alix
cherry
flushed
angered
again
in
the
way
under
all
her
fright
and
stir
her
voice
had
its
old
bored
note
well
martin
i
been
their
guest
for
two
months
i
just
as
soon
have
them
martin
conceded
indifferently
but
the
diverted
thought
had
helped
cherry
irritation
had
nerved
her
and
the
reminder
of
martin
old
trying
stupidities
had
lessened
her
fear
of
him
i
got
to
send
a
alix
she
said
what
about
he
asked
less
curious
than
to
some
people
who
are
sailing
cherry
answered
calmly
only
do
mention
it
to
alix
because
i
promised
it
would
go
earlier
she
added
i
saw
the
office
back
here
he
told
her
they
went
to
it
together
and
he
was
within
five
feet
of
her
while
she
scribbled
her
note
martin
met
me
nothing
wrong
we
are
returning
to
mill
valley
she
glanced
at
her
husband
he
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
little
office
smoking
quickly
she
addressed
the
envelope
do
read
that
name
out
loud
she
said
softly
but
very
slowly
and
distinctly
to
the
girl
at
the
desk
she
put
a
gold
piece
down
on
the
note
keep
the
change
and
for
god
sake
get
that
to
the
harvard
sailing
from
dock
before
eleven
she
said
the
girl
who
had
been
pencilling
a
large
on
the
envelope
looked
up
in
surprise
but
rose
immediately
to
the
occasion
beauty
her
agonized
eyes
and
voice
were
enough
to
awaken
her
sense
of
the
dramatic
a
sharp
rap
of
the
clerk
pencil
summoned
a
boy
george
there
a
dollar
in
that
for
you
if
you
deliver
it
before
eleven
to
the
harvard
said
she
the
boy
seized
it
stuck
it
in
his
hat
and
fled
and
now
for
the
boat
cherry
said
rejoining
martin
and
speaking
in
almost
her
natural
voice
they
went
back
to
the
sausalito
ferry
entrance
again
and
this
time
telephoned
alix
in
real
earnest
and
presently
found
themselves
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
boat
bound
for
the
valley
until
now
and
in
occasional
rushes
of
terror
still
she
had
been
absorbed
in
the
hideous
necessity
of
deceiving
of
covering
her
own
traces
of
anticipating
and
closing
possible
avenues
of
betrayal
but
now
cherry
began
to
breathe
more
easily
and
to
feel
rising
about
her
like
a
tide
the
consciousness
of
her
relationship
with
this
man
in
the
suit
who
was
sitting
beside
her
she
had
thought
to
escape
the
necessity
of
telling
him
that
she
was
not
willing
to
return
to
him
she
had
been
wrapped
in
dreams
so
great
and
so
wonderful
that
the
thought
of
his
anger
and
resentment
had
been
as
nothing
to
her
but
she
had
all
that
to
face
now
she
had
it
to
face
immediately
too
she
knew
that
every
hour
of
postponement
would
cost
her
fresh
humiliations
and
difficulties
he
did
not
love
her
but
he
was
quietly
taking
her
for
granted
again
and
until
she
could
summon
courage
to
speak
to
him
with
utter
frankness
and
finality
he
would
of
course
claim
his
position
as
her
husband
the
thought
threw
her
into
a
nervous
agitation
almost
as
frightful
as
that
of
meeting
him
had
been
and
again
she
felt
the
dizzy
faintness
and
sickness
of
that
moment
the
trip
from
san
francisco
to
sausalito
occupies
exactly
half
an
hour
after
that
there
was
a
train
trip
of
twenty
minutes
cherry
knew
that
what
was
done
must
be
done
in
that
time
in
mill
valley
alix
would
meet
them
perhaps
willing
to
take
any
cue
that
cherry
gave
her
as
to
their
relationship
but
of
course
anxious
to
have
that
relationship
as
pleasant
and
normal
and
friendly
as
possible
her
head
was
still
rocking
from
the
shock
of
the
experiences
of
the
last
hour
and
the
last
fortnight
even
had
she
met
peter
it
might
have
been
to
yield
with
a
sort
of
collapse
to
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
but
to
be
forced
to
make
a
fresh
effort
now
one
of
the
crucial
and
fearful
struggles
of
a
lifetime
to
present
her
case
to
martin
now
and
force
him
to
her
viewpoint
was
almost
impossible
yet
cherry
knew
that
it
must
be
done
and
as
the
boat
slipped
smoothly
past
the
island
that
roughly
marked
the
halfway
point
she
gathered
all
her
forces
for
the
trial
martin
was
meanwhile
energetically
presenting
to
her
the
arguments
that
had
convinced
him
that
he
must
give
up
the
mexico
position
she
vaguely
appreciated
that
someone
named
murry
was
a
traitor
and
that
the
whole
bunch
were
rubes
but
her
mind
was
busy
with
its
own
problem
all
the
while
and
the
one
distinct
impression
she
had
from
martin
was
the
appalling
one
that
he
did
not
dream
that
she
had
decided
to
sever
their
union
completely
and
finally
well
how
the
valley
bore
you
to
death
he
interrupted
the
flow
of
his
own
topic
to
ask
carelessly
oh
no
martin
she
quivered
i
i
love
it
there
i
always
loved
it
alix
is
a
fine
girl
she
a
nice
girl
martin
conceded
but
i
go
peter
he
may
be
all
right
all
that
and
omar
khayyam
and
browning
stuff
may
be
all
right
but
i
do
get
it
and
he
yawned
contentedly
in
the
sunshine
after
a
few
seconds
he
gave
cherry
an
oblique
glance
expecting
her
resentment
but
she
was
thinking
too
deeply
even
to
have
heard
him
her
mind
was
working
as
desperately
as
a
caged
animal
her
thoughts
circling
frantically
trying
windows
walls
and
doors
in
the
prison
in
which
she
found
herself
mad
for
escape
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
now
for
allowing
him
in
the
surprise
and
fear
she
felt
in
the
shock
of
their
unexpected
meeting
to
arrange
this
domestic
and
apparently
reconciled
return
to
the
valley
house
had
she
known
beforehand
that
they
were
to
meet
she
would
have
steeled
herself
to
suggest
to
him
coldly
that
they
lunch
somewhere
and
talk
she
could
imagine
now
the
quiet
significance
with
which
she
would
have
stressed
the
phrase
martin
i
want
to
talk
to
you
better
still
she
would
have
anticipated
that
meeting
with
a
letter
that
would
have
warned
him
that
his
position
as
a
husband
was
changed
but
it
was
too
late
now
too
late
for
anything
but
a
bald
and
brave
and
cruel
that
should
at
any
cost
sunder
them
quick
upon
the
thought
came
another
what
should
she
and
peter
plan
now
for
to
suppose
that
their
lives
were
to
be
guided
back
into
the
old
hateful
channel
by
this
mere
mischance
was
preposterous
within
a
few
days
their
interrupted
trip
must
be
resumed
perhaps
perhaps
this
very
night
they
would
manage
it
successfully
alix
was
unsuspicious
martin
utterly
unconcerned
and
perhaps
it
would
be
even
easier
to
do
now
than
when
alix
must
at
once
communicate
with
martin
and
perhaps
bring
him
away
from
his
work
to
adjust
life
to
the
new
conditions
but
meanwhile
until
she
could
see
peter
alone
there
was
martin
to
deal
with
martin
who
was
leaning
forward
vaingloriously
reciting
to
her
long
speeches
he
had
made
to
this
superior
or
that
martin
she
said
impetuously
interrupting
him
i
got
to
talk
to
you
i
meant
to
write
it
so
many
times
i
had
it
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
left
red
creek
shoot
martin
said
with
his
favourite
look
of
indulgent
amusement
but
she
knew
the
little
twitch
to
his
lips
that
was
neither
indulgent
nor
amused
there
are
marriages
that
without
any
fault
on
either
side
are
a
mistake
cherry
began
any
contributory
fault
i
mean
talk
united
states
martin
growled
smiling
but
on
guard
well
i
think
our
marriage
was
one
of
those
cherry
said
what
have
you
got
to
kick
about
martin
asked
after
a
pause
i
not
kicking
cherry
answered
with
quick
resentment
but
i
wish
i
had
words
to
make
you
realize
how
i
feel
about
it
martin
looked
gloomily
up
at
her
and
shrugged
this
is
a
sweet
welcome
from
your
wife
he
observed
but
as
she
regarded
him
with
troubled
and
earnest
eyes
perhaps
her
beauty
made
an
unexpected
appeal
to
him
for
he
turned
toward
her
and
eyed
her
with
a
large
tolerance
what
the
matter
cherry
he
asked
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
got
much
to
kick
about
have
i
always
taken
pretty
good
care
of
you
did
i
take
the
house
and
move
the
things
in
did
i
leave
you
a
whole
month
while
i
ate
at
that
rotten
when
your
father
died
have
i
let
you
have
how
long
is
it
seven
weeks
by
george
with
your
sister
it
poured
out
too
readily
to
be
unpremeditated
cherry
recognized
the
tones
of
his
old
arraigning
voice
he
had
brooded
over
his
grievances
he
felt
himself
now
you
come
in
for
this
money
he
began
but
she
interrupted
him
hotly
martin
you
know
that
is
not
true
is
it
true
that
the
instant
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
you
begin
to
talk
about
not
being
happy
and
so
on
he
asked
without
any
particular
feeling
you
bet
you
do
why
i
never
cared
anything
about
that
money
you
never
heard
me
speak
of
it
i
always
felt
that
by
the
time
the
lawyers
and
the
heirs
and
the
witnesses
got
through
there
would
be
much
left
of
it
anyway
too
rich
in
her
new
position
of
the
woman
beloved
by
peter
to
quarrel
with
martin
in
the
old
unhappy
fashion
cherry
laid
an
appealing
hand
on
his
arm
i
sorry
to
meet
you
with
this
sort
of
thing
she
said
simply
i
blame
myself
now
for
not
writing
you
just
how
i
come
to
feel
about
it
but
i
just
want
it
said
before
we
meet
alix
have
what
said
he
asked
surlily
have
it
understood
she
pursued
patiently
that
we
must
make
some
arrangement
for
the
future
things
ca
be
as
they
were
you
had
it
all
your
way
ever
since
we
were
married
he
began
now
you
blame
me
i
do
blame
you
martin
well
what
do
you
want
a
divorce
for
then
i
do
even
say
anything
about
a
divorce
cherry
said
fighting
for
time
only
but
i
ca
go
back
she
added
with
a
sudden
force
and
conviction
that
reached
him
at
last
why
ca
you
because
you
do
love
me
martin
and
you
know
it
i
do
love
you
well
but
you
ca
expect
the
way
we
felt
when
we
got
married
to
last
forever
he
said
clumsily
do
you
suppose
other
men
and
women
talk
this
way
when
the
the
novelty
has
worn
off
i
do
know
how
they
talk
i
only
know
how
i
feel
cherry
said
chilled
by
the
old
generalization
martin
who
had
stretched
his
legs
to
their
length
crossed
them
at
the
ankles
and
shoved
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
staring
at
the
racing
blue
water
with
sombre
eyes
what
do
you
want
he
asked
heavily
i
want
to
live
my
own
life
cherry
answered
after
a
silence
during
which
her
tortured
spirit
seemed
to
coin
the
hackneyed
phrase
that
stuff
martin
sneered
under
his
breath
well
all
right
i
do
care
get
your
divorce
he
agreed
carelessly
but
i
have
something
to
say
about
that
too
he
warned
her
you
can
drag
the
whole
thing
up
before
the
courts
if
you
want
to
only
remember
if
you
do
like
it
much
you
did
it
it
never
occurred
to
me
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
done
my
share
in
this
business
you
never
asked
me
for
anything
i
could
give
you
that
you
did
get
you
never
been
tied
down
to
housework
like
other
women
you
not
raising
a
family
of
kids
go
ahead
tell
every
in
san
francisco
all
about
it
in
the
papers
and
see
how
much
sympathy
you
get
oh
you
beast
cherry
said
between
her
teeth
furious
tears
in
her
eyes
the
water
swam
in
a
blur
of
blue
before
her
as
they
rose
to
go
downstairs
at
sausalito
the
boat
had
made
the
slip
and
the
few
passengers
at
this
quiet
noontime
were
drifting
off
martin
glanced
at
her
with
impatience
her
tears
never
failed
to
anger
him
do
cry
for
god
sake
he
said
nervously
glancing
about
for
possible
onlookers
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
the
lord
sake
do
make
a
scene
until
you
and
i
have
a
chance
to
talk
this
over
quietly
cherry
thoughts
were
with
peter
in
her
soul
she
felt
as
if
his
arm
was
about
her
as
if
she
were
pouring
out
to
him
the
whole
troubled
story
sure
that
he
would
rescue
and
console
her
she
had
wiped
her
eyes
and
somewhat
recovered
calm
but
she
trusted
herself
only
to
shrug
her
shoulder
as
she
preceded
mart
to
the
train
there
was
time
for
not
another
word
for
alix
suddenly
took
possession
of
them
she
had
had
time
to
bring
the
car
all
the
six
miles
to
sausalito
and
meant
to
drive
them
direct
to
the
valley
from
there
she
greeted
martin
affectionately
although
even
while
she
did
so
her
eyes
went
with
a
quick
worried
look
to
cherry
they
had
been
quarrelling
of
course
it
was
too
bad
alix
thought
but
her
own
course
was
clear
until
she
could
take
her
cue
from
them
she
must
treat
them
both
with
cheerful
unconsciousness
of
the
storm
she
invited
martin
to
share
the
driver
seat
with
her
pushing
the
resentful
buck
into
the
tonneau
with
cherry
alix
in
the
months
that
she
had
not
seen
him
had
had
time
to
develop
a
certain
generous
sympathy
for
martin
but
as
she
took
the
car
swiftly
through
the
warm
sweet
summer
day
she
began
to
realize
afresh
just
how
serious
cherry
problem
was
it
was
not
merely
that
martin
chewed
a
toothpick
as
he
talked
to
her
and
took
out
a
to
trim
a
it
was
not
that
he
was
somewhat
vain
stupid
and
opinionated
for
the
minor
social
deficiencies
might
have
been
remedied
in
a
larger
nature
by
an
affectionate
word
and
there
were
times
alix
felt
when
the
best
of
men
are
insistent
upon
perverse
and
perverted
views
and
unashamed
or
unconscious
of
their
limitations
martin
had
coarsened
in
the
six
years
since
they
had
first
known
him
there
had
been
something
unspoiled
vigorous
and
fresh
about
him
then
that
was
gone
now
alix
sensed
that
his
associates
in
the
mining
towns
in
which
he
had
lived
had
been
men
and
women
of
a
low
type
the
defiling
influence
had
left
its
mark
missing
entertainment
in
his
home
he
had
sought
it
elsewhere
but
besides
these
things
martin
had
a
certain
complacency
an
assurance
that
would
have
been
inexcusable
even
in
great
genius
a
mental
arrogance
that
nothing
in
his
life
in
the
least
degree
warranted
he
made
no
slight
effort
to
adapt
himself
to
the
atmosphere
in
which
he
found
his
wife
and
her
sister
interested
himself
for
not
one
moment
in
their
concerns
put
out
no
feelers
toward
the
mood
that
might
have
made
him
an
agreeable
addition
to
their
group
he
conceded
nothing
he
was
martin
lloyd
mining
engineer
philosopher
man
of
the
world
and
it
was
for
them
to
listen
to
him
admire
him
and
praise
and
tease
and
flatter
him
in
all
he
did
humility
and
shyness
were
never
a
part
of
martin
nature
but
he
was
galled
by
his
talk
with
cherry
and
less
inclined
even
than
usual
to
abase
himself
does
peter
let
you
drive
the
car
on
these
mountain
roads
he
demanded
of
alix
oh
yes
indeed
i
love
to
run
the
car
she
said
with
a
swift
smiling
glance
well
you
want
to
keep
your
eyes
on
the
road
he
warned
her
nothing
worries
me
like
having
a
lady
at
the
wheel
he
went
on
that
the
time
i
say
my
prayers
plenty
of
women
running
cars
now
martin
alix
said
cheerfully
wishing
that
martin
did
always
and
infallibly
nettle
her
but
it
no
business
for
a
woman
he
assured
her
in
a
suddenly
serious
and
confidential
undertone
no
business
for
them
they
the
strength
in
the
first
place
and
they
have
well
they
too
nervous
in
the
second
mouse
cross
the
road
said
martin
sucking
in
deep
breaths
as
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
whee
over
she
goes
into
a
ditch
no
he
said
kindly
i
a
great
friend
of
all
the
ladies
but
i
think
they
make
a
mistake
when
they
think
they
men
only
one
accident
in
ten
is
with
a
woman
driver
alix
argued
that
may
be
true
too
martin
conceded
largely
she
knew
that
he
was
drawing
his
words
merely
to
cover
any
impression
of
being
caught
unprepared
that
may
be
true
too
but
do
you
believe
that
half
the
cases
of
women
accidents
get
into
the
courts
he
added
knowingly
you
bet
your
life
they
do
you
bet
your
sweet
life
they
do
oh
no
pretty
girl
smiles
at
the
policeman
he
smoked
a
few
seconds
in
triumphant
silence
why
you
knew
that
did
you
he
asked
in
kindly
patronage
i
suppose
so
alix
said
briefly
after
swallowing
a
more
spirited
answer
with
a
gulp
oh
sure
martin
agreed
in
great
content
they
reached
the
valley
and
martin
was
magnanimous
about
the
delayed
lunch
anything
would
do
for
him
he
said
he
was
taking
a
couple
of
days
holiday
and
everything
went
kow
was
chopping
wood
after
lunch
and
he
sauntered
out
to
the
block
with
suggestions
alix
laying
a
fire
for
the
evening
simply
because
she
liked
to
do
that
sort
of
work
was
favoured
with
directions
finally
martin
pushed
her
aside
here
let
me
do
that
he
said
you
have
a
fine
fire
here
at
that
rate
later
he
went
down
to
the
old
house
with
them
to
spend
there
an
hour
that
was
trying
to
both
women
it
was
almost
in
order
now
cherry
had
pleased
her
simple
fancy
in
the
matter
of
hangings
and
papering
and
the
effect
was
fresh
and
good
the
kitchen
smelled
cleanly
of
white
paint
and
the
other
rooms
wore
almost
their
old
hospitable
aspect
girls
going
to
rent
this
martin
asked
unless
you
and
cherry
come
live
here
alix
said
boldly
he
smiled
tolerantly
why
should
we
well
why
should
you
loafing
eh
no
not
loafing
but
you
could
transfer
your
work
to
san
francisco
could
you
martin
smiled
a
deep
wise
smile
oh
you
get
me
a
job
i
suppose
he
asked
i
love
the
way
you
women
try
to
run
things
he
added
but
i
guess
i
paddle
my
own
canoe
for
awhile
longer
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
you
should
live
here
alix
said
pleasantly
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
we
should
martin
returned
he
was
annoyed
by
a
suspicion
that
alix
and
cherry
had
arranged
between
them
to
make
this
plan
the
alternative
to
a
divorce
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
i
do
like
mill
valley
alix
tasted
despair
small
hope
of
preserving
this
particular
relationship
he
was
as
cherry
had
said
impossible
well
we
must
try
to
make
you
like
mill
valley
better
she
said
with
resolute
of
course
it
means
a
lot
to
cherry
and
to
me
to
be
near
each
other
that
may
be
true
too
martin
agreed
taking
the
front
seat
again
for
the
drive
home
he
told
cherry
later
that
he
liked
alix
and
alix
was
interested
enough
in
keeping
him
happy
to
deliberately
play
upon
his
easily
touched
she
humoured
him
laughed
at
his
jokes
asked
him
the
questions
that
he
was
able
to
answer
and
loved
to
answer
she
was
surprised
at
cherry
passivity
and
silence
but
cherry
was
wrapped
in
a
sick
and
nervous
dream
unable
either
to
interpret
the
present
or
face
the
future
with
any
courage
before
luncheon
he
had
followed
her
into
her
room
and
had
put
his
arm
about
her
but
she
had
quietly
shaken
him
off
with
the
nervous
murmur
please
no
kiss
me
martin
stung
martin
had
immediately
dropped
his
arm
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
and
laughed
scornfully
now
he
remarked
to
alix
with
some
bravado
you
girls
still
sleeping
out
oh
always
we
all
do
alix
had
answered
readily
peter
has
an
extra
bunk
on
his
porch
cherry
and
i
have
my
porch
but
you
can
be
out
or
in
as
you
choose
martin
ventured
an
answer
that
made
cherry
eyes
glint
angrily
and
brought
a
quick
embarrassed
flush
to
alix
face
alix
did
not
enjoy
a
certain
type
of
joking
and
she
did
not
concede
martin
even
the
ghost
of
a
smile
he
immediately
sobered
and
remarked
that
he
himself
liked
to
be
indoors
at
night
his
suitcase
was
accordingly
taken
into
the
pleasant
little
room
next
to
peter
where
the
autumn
sunlight
scented
with
the
dry
sweetness
of
mountain
shrubs
was
streaming
he
began
to
play
solitaire
on
the
porch
table
at
five
and
kow
had
to
disturb
him
to
set
it
for
dinner
at
seven
alix
was
watering
the
garden
cherry
was
dressing
it
was
an
exquisite
hour
of
long
shadows
and
brilliant
lights
bees
from
alix
hives
went
to
and
fro
and
the
air
was
full
and
fragrant
as
if
a
golden
powder
had
been
scattered
through
it
kow
had
put
a
tureen
of
soup
on
the
table
and
alix
had
returned
with
damp
clean
hands
and
trimly
brushed
hair
for
supper
when
peter
came
up
through
the
garden
cherry
had
rambled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
barn
a
few
moments
before
but
martin
had
followed
her
and
brought
her
back
remarking
that
she
had
had
no
idea
of
the
time
and
was
idly
watching
antone
milking
she
slipped
into
her
place
after
they
were
all
eating
and
hardly
raised
her
eyes
throughout
the
meal
if
alix
addressed
her
she
fluttered
the
white
lids
as
if
it
were
an
absolute
agony
to
look
up
to
peter
she
did
not
speak
at
all
but
to
martin
she
sent
an
occasional
answer
and
when
the
conversation
lagged
as
it
was
apt
to
do
in
this
company
she
nervously
filled
it
with
random
remarks
infinitely
less
reassuring
than
silence
how
long
do
we
stay
here
martin
cautiously
asked
his
wife
when
after
dinner
peter
could
be
heard
in
the
kitchen
interrogating
kow
and
when
the
drip
and
splash
of
alix
hose
was
sounding
steadily
from
the
other
end
of
the
garden
stay
here
she
echoed
at
a
loss
yes
he
answered
decidedly
i
can
stand
a
little
of
it
but
i
think
much
of
this
sort
of
life
i
thought
maybe
we
could
all
go
into
town
for
dinner
and
the
theatre
or
saturday
but
on
monday
we
have
to
beat
it
monday
cherry
heart
bounded
my
idea
was
you
to
come
up
with
me
martin
continued
we
see
the
folks
in
portland
martin
is
it
a
mistake
to
go
on
pretending
she
began
bitterly
but
peter
voice
in
the
drawing
room
interrupted
her
i
let
you
know
we
talk
about
it
she
had
time
to
say
hurriedly
before
he
came
out
to
them
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
martin
at
once
opened
a
general
conversation
in
which
alix
still
diligently
watering
was
presently
near
enough
to
take
part
chapter
xix
the
evening
dragged
alix
had
suggested
bridge
but
martin
did
not
play
bridge
so
she
presently
scattered
anagrams
over
the
table
reminding
peter
of
some
of
their
battles
with
in
the
long
winter
nights
and
they
had
a
game
in
which
martin
showed
no
interest
at
all
and
peter
deliberately
missed
chances
to
score
alix
glanced
furtively
at
her
it
was
twenty
minutes
of
ten
as
martin
flung
himself
into
a
chair
beside
the
fire
and
lighted
one
of
his
strong
cigars
she
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
ramble
through
various
songs
hoping
that
somebody
would
start
to
sing
or
suggest
a
favourite
or
in
some
way
help
to
lighten
the
dreadful
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
cherry
and
peter
left
at
the
table
did
not
speak
to
each
other
peter
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
cigarette
cherry
dreamily
pushed
to
and
fro
the
little
wooden
block
letters
but
presently
her
heart
gave
a
great
plunge
and
although
she
did
not
alter
her
different
attitude
or
raise
her
eyes
her
white
hand
moved
with
directed
impulse
and
peter
casual
glance
fell
upon
the
word
alone
when
he
laid
his
finished
cigarette
in
the
tray
it
was
to
finger
the
letters
himself
in
turn
and
cherry
realized
with
a
great
thrill
of
relief
that
he
was
answering
her
carelessly
and
obliterating
one
word
before
he
began
another
he
formed
the
question
my
office
martin
always
with
me
cherry
spelled
back
she
did
not
glance
at
peter
but
at
martin
who
was
watching
the
fire
and
at
alix
whose
back
was
toward
the
room
come
on
have
another
game
peter
asked
generally
while
he
spelled
quickly
will
arrange
sailing
first
possible
day
alix
humming
along
with
her
song
said
wait
a
few
minutes
and
martin
glanced
up
to
say
no
i
no
good
at
that
thing
then
cherry
and
peter
were
unobserved
again
and
she
spelled
mart
goes
monday
plans
to
take
me
peter
had
reached
for
a
magazine
he
whirled
through
the
pages
and
yawned
then
he
began
to
play
with
the
anagrams
again
can
you
get
away
without
him
he
spelled
how
cherry
instantly
asked
and
as
peter
hands
went
on
building
a
little
bridge
of
wooden
letters
she
went
on
alix
to
train
martin
with
me
to
city
impossible
give
him
the
slip
peter
spelled
and
after
a
pause
he
added
life
or
death
difficult
to
evade
cherry
spelled
wiping
the
words
away
one
by
one
must
wait
peter
began
alix
ending
her
song
on
a
crash
of
chords
came
to
the
table
interrupting
him
cherry
was
now
lazily
reading
a
magazine
peter
had
built
a
little
pen
of
tiny
blocks
i
go
you
alix
said
with
spirit
but
the
game
was
rather
a
languid
one
nevertheless
and
when
it
was
over
they
gathered
yawning
about
the
mantel
ready
to
disperse
for
the
night
and
night
we
dine
in
town
and
go
to
the
orpheum
alix
asked
for
the
plan
had
been
suggested
at
i
blow
you
girls
to
any
show
you
like
martin
offered
he
took
out
his
big
watch
cherry
remembered
just
how
smoothly
this
watch
always
seemed
to
slip
in
and
out
of
his
pocket
and
smiled
at
them
ten
he
grinned
i
set
up
awhile
longer
and
have
a
look
at
the
evening
papers
well
peter
conceded
cherry
was
shocked
by
the
sudden
chill
and
sternness
of
his
face
immediately
remarking
that
he
was
tired
he
went
to
his
room
cherry
with
only
a
general
also
disappeared
to
find
alix
arranging
beds
and
pillows
on
their
sleeping
porch
oh
alix
i
so
worried
i
so
sick
with
worry
cherry
whispered
alix
sitting
still
in
the
circle
of
light
thrown
from
the
reading
lamp
light
over
her
bed
nodded
with
a
stricken
face
he
wo
listen
to
me
said
cherry
he
wo
hear
of
a
divorce
i
know
alix
said
distressedly
but
what
shall
i
do
i
ca
go
with
him
cherry
protested
alix
was
silent
what
shall
i
do
cherry
pleaded
again
why
i
do
see
what
else
you
can
do
but
go
with
him
alix
said
in
a
troubled
voice
i
should
think
that
no
man
would
want
his
wife
knowing
that
she
did
want
to
be
with
him
and
i
should
think
that
to
leave
you
here
with
enough
money
to
live
on
and
your
own
old
home
would
suit
him
better
than
to
drag
you
she
sighed
but
if
it
does
she
finished
of
course
it
does
alter
your
obligation
in
a
way
you
are
his
wife
better
or
worse
for
richer
or
poorer
till
death
it
was
said
so
kindly
with
alix
simple
and
embarrassed
fashion
of
giving
advice
that
poor
cherry
could
not
resent
it
she
could
only
bow
her
head
desolately
upon
her
knees
as
she
sat
in
her
bed
and
cry
a
nice
mess
i
made
of
my
life
she
sobbed
i
made
a
nice
mess
of
it
i
wish
oh
my
god
how
i
wish
i
was
dead
my
own
life
has
been
so
darned
easy
alix
mused
in
a
cautious
undertone
sitting
fully
dressed
on
the
side
of
her
own
bed
and
studying
her
sister
with
pitying
eyes
i
often
wondered
if
i
could
buck
up
and
get
through
with
it
if
some
of
that
sort
of
thing
had
come
to
me
i
do
know
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
say
loses
his
life
shall
gain
it
and
i
stand
anything
people
and
places
i
hated
loneliness
and
poverty
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
i
think
i
would
i
mean
i
read
the
bible
and
shakespere
and
enjoy
my
meals
and
have
a
garden
her
voice
sank
i
know
it
terribly
hard
for
you
cherry
she
ended
suddenly
pitiful
cherry
had
stopped
crying
dried
her
eyes
and
had
reached
resolutely
for
the
book
that
was
waiting
on
the
little
shelf
above
the
porch
bed
you
bigger
than
i
am
she
said
quietly
or
else
i
so
made
that
i
suffer
more
i
wish
i
could
face
the
music
but
i
ca
do
anything
of
course
just
just
loathing
some
things
about
a
man
is
valid
cause
for
divorce
i
know
that
but
i
rather
live
with
a
man
that
drank
and
stole
and
beat
me
i
rather
he
should
disgrace
me
before
the
whole
world
and
drag
me
to
prison
with
him
than
to
feel
as
i
feel
i
would
alix
i
tell
you
her
voice
was
rising
but
suddenly
she
interrupted
herself
and
spoke
in
a
lifeless
and
apologetic
tone
i
sorry
she
said
one
knows
of
unhappy
marriages
everywhere
without
quite
fancying
just
what
a
horrible
tragedy
an
unhappy
marriage
is
do
mind
me
alix
the
mill
valley
zeus
will
have
an
item
in
it
this
week
that
and
martin
lloyd
have
gone
to
visit
relatives
in
portland
oregon
and
nobody
know
but
what
we
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world
and
perhaps
we
are
alix
laughed
uncomfortably
she
was
conscious
as
she
went
out
to
speak
to
kow
about
breakfast
and
to
give
a
final
glance
at
fires
and
lights
that
this
was
one
of
the
times
when
girls
needed
a
wise
mother
or
a
father
who
could
decide
blame
and
advise
coming
back
from
the
kitchen
with
a
pitcher
of
hot
water
she
saw
martin
in
a
welter
of
evening
papers
staring
at
the
last
pink
ashes
of
the
wood
fire
upon
seeing
her
he
got
up
and
with
a
cautious
glance
toward
the
bedroom
doors
he
said
look
here
a
minute
can
they
hear
us
alix
set
down
her
pitcher
of
water
and
came
to
stand
beside
him
hear
us
peter
and
cherry
no
cherry
out
on
our
porch
and
porch
is
even
farther
away
why
take
a
look
will
you
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
alix
mystified
duly
went
to
glance
at
cherry
reading
now
in
a
little
funnel
of
yellow
light
and
then
crossed
to
enter
peter
room
his
porch
was
dark
but
she
could
see
the
outline
of
the
tall
figure
lying
across
the
bed
asleep
she
asked
nope
he
answered
well
do
go
to
sleep
without
pulling
a
rug
over
you
she
commanded
pete
old
girl
something
in
the
tone
touched
her
with
a
vague
hint
of
unhappiness
but
she
did
not
stop
to
analyze
it
she
went
back
through
his
room
and
through
the
little
passage
and
rejoined
martin
the
freedom
of
peter
apartment
alix
had
always
taken
as
naturally
as
she
did
the
freedom
of
her
father
ca
hear
us
eh
martin
asked
when
again
she
stood
beside
him
positively
not
she
answered
look
here
he
said
abruptly
what
brought
me
up
here
is
this
making
love
to
cherry
indignant
and
with
rising
colour
she
stared
at
him
who
what
she
having
a
nice
little
quiet
flirtation
with
somebody
martin
said
with
a
significant
and
warning
smile
who
is
it
i
do
know
who
been
talking
to
you
about
cherry
martin
alix
said
sharply
but
you
know
you
ca
repeat
that
sort
of
rotten
scandal
to
me
i
do
mean
any
harm
i
do
mean
any
harm
he
assured
her
with
a
quick
attempt
to
quiet
the
storm
he
had
raised
do
get
mad
get
mad
but
i
happen
to
know
that
there
some
attraction
keeping
cherry
here
and
i
came
up
to
look
over
the
ground
for
myself
do
you
see
his
look
which
was
almost
a
leer
seemed
to
imply
that
alix
was
in
the
secret
a
party
to
cherry
foolishness
and
did
imply
very
distinctly
that
martin
felt
himself
to
be
more
than
a
match
for
all
their
cunning
the
woman
was
silent
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
come
on
now
put
me
on
he
said
alix
made
an
effort
at
martin
you
mistaken
she
said
quietly
you
have
no
right
to
listen
to
any
one
who
tells
you
such
things
and
if
it
was
that
you
cherry
husband
i
would
listen
to
you
but
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
that
it
a
lie
we
three
have
lived
up
here
without
seeing
any
one
cherry
has
hardly
spoken
to
a
man
except
peter
and
antone
and
kow
since
she
came
who
this
george
sewall
he
asked
shrewdly
the
lawyer
oh
heavens
martin
why
george
was
a
beau
of
mine
he
a
widower
of
fifty
and
has
just
announced
his
engagement
to
the
trained
nurse
that
took
care
of
his
boy
h
martin
commented
if
any
one
mentioned
cherry
name
in
connection
with
george
alix
said
firmly
that
was
a
perfectly
malicious
slander
sewall
was
mentioned
martin
said
hastily
whose
name
was
mentioned
then
alix
pursued
hotly
well
nobody
name
was
mentioned
martin
took
a
great
many
creased
and
rubbed
papers
from
his
vest
pockets
and
shifted
them
over
finally
with
a
fat
deliberate
hand
he
selected
one
and
put
the
others
away
this
is
from
my
mother
he
said
my
aunt
north
we
saw
her
here
a
week
or
two
ago
alix
said
as
he
paused
well
she
was
in
portland
and
saw
the
folks
said
martin
and
my
mother
writes
me
this
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
searching
he
read
from
the
letter
bessie
north
saw
cherry
and
joyce
in
mill
valley
and
if
i
was
you
i
would
not
let
cherry
stay
away
too
long
a
wife
place
is
with
her
husband
especially
when
she
is
as
pretty
as
cherry
and
if
bessie
is
right
somebody
else
thinks
she
is
pretty
too
and
you
know
it
does
take
much
to
start
people
talking
it
is
like
she
had
a
couple
of
children
to
keep
her
busy
why
do
you
bring
her
up
here
and
leave
her
with
papa
and
me
while
you
look
over
the
mexican
proposition
that
all
of
that
said
martin
folding
the
letter
he
eyed
alix
keenly
well
what
do
you
think
he
asked
triumphantly
i
think
that
a
mean
wicked
thing
to
say
she
said
indignantly
no
martin
she
said
silencing
him
as
he
would
have
interrupted
her
i
know
she
is
beautiful
and
young
and
i
know
because
she
told
me
that
you
and
she
feel
that
your
marriage
is
a
mistake
but
if
you
think
oh
she
said
that
did
she
do
use
that
tone
alix
commanded
him
quickly
she
did
blame
you
or
herself
except
in
that
she
did
listen
to
my
father
who
thought
she
was
too
young
to
marry
any
one
but
if
you
want
to
lose
her
martin
alix
said
with
heat
just
let
her
suspect
all
this
petty
suspicion
and
scandal
cherry
proud
now
look
here
he
said
with
his
air
of
assurance
i
proud
too
and
if
i
do
choose
to
stand
before
the
world
as
a
divorced
man
nobody
talking
of
divorce
alix
hushed
him
but
no
woman
would
stand
having
other
women
spy
and
suspect
how
about
this
sewall
he
muttered
by
george
she
had
something
on
her
mind
when
she
met
me
she
was
fussed
all
right
and
it
was
all
the
surprise
of
seeing
me
either
first
she
wanted
to
telephone
you
then
she
fussed
over
your
message
cherry
gets
fluttered
very
easily
alix
reminded
him
well
she
was
fussed
all
right
this
morning
she
said
not
to
mention
it
to
alix
because
she
had
promised
that
it
should
go
on
time
i
thought
maybe
she
meant
that
you
wanted
her
to
go
herself
no
she
said
a
note
would
do
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
alix
said
puzzled
your
note
martin
explained
what
note
i
did
write
any
note
cherry
telephoned
no
he
said
patiently
and
perfunctorily
you
wanted
cherry
to
those
people
who
were
sailing
that
was
all
she
wrote
it
it
got
there
in
time
i
guess
anyway
i
heard
the
girl
say
to
rush
it
to
the
boat
oh
alix
said
oh
she
added
her
tone
betrayed
nothing
but
she
was
thoroughly
at
sea
did
i
ask
cherry
to
say
to
any
one
she
asked
herself
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
long
day
instinct
warned
her
that
nothing
would
be
gained
by
sharing
her
perplexity
with
martin
i
give
you
my
word
that
she
has
been
five
minutes
alone
with
any
one
but
peter
and
me
she
said
frankly
looking
into
martin
eyes
now
are
you
satisfied
sure
i
satisfied
he
answered
she
did
go
into
town
to
lunch
with
any
one
he
asked
no
alix
said
scornfully
she
always
lunches
with
us
you
deserve
her
to
talk
so
about
her
martin
she
said
well
i
not
anybody
fool
you
know
he
assured
her
all
right
i
take
your
for
it
he
yawned
trouble
with
cherry
is
she
has
enough
to
do
he
finished
sapiently
i
a
poor
person
with
whom
to
discuss
cherry
alix
hinted
with
an
unsmiling
nod
for
and
she
looked
at
cherry
head
ten
minutes
later
with
a
thrill
of
maternal
protectiveness
cherry
was
evidently
asleep
buried
deep
under
the
blue
army
blankets
but
alix
did
not
get
to
sleep
that
night
she
did
not
even
undress
for
it
was
while
sitting
on
the
side
of
her
bed
ready
to
begin
the
process
that
through
her
excited
and
indignant
and
whirling
thoughts
the
first
suspicion
shot
like
a
touch
of
flame
how
dares
martin
how
dares
he
her
thoughts
had
run
and
then
suddenly
she
had
said
why
she
has
seen
no
one
but
peter
she
has
seen
no
one
but
peter
i
tell
peter
all
this
when
martin
has
gone
alix
decided
be
furious
he
adores
cherry
he
be
furious
he
thinks
that
there
is
no
one
like
cherry
the
words
she
had
said
came
back
to
her
and
she
said
them
again
with
a
look
of
pain
and
almost
of
fear
suddenly
coming
into
her
eyes
peter
adores
cherry
and
then
she
knew
even
while
the
sick
suspicion
formed
itself
vague
and
menacing
and
horrible
in
her
heart
she
knew
the
truth
of
it
and
though
for
hours
she
was
to
weigh
it
and
measure
it
to
remember
and
question
and
compare
all
the
days
and
hours
that
she
and
peter
and
cherry
had
been
together
from
the
moment
the
thought
was
born
she
knew
that
it
was
to
be
with
her
as
an
accepted
fact
for
all
time
to
come
chapter
xx
for
a
few
seconds
alix
felt
ill
dazed
and
shocked
almost
beyond
enduring
she
sat
immovable
her
eyes
fixed
her
body
held
rigid
as
a
body
might
be
in
the
second
before
it
fell
after
a
bullet
had
cleanly
pierced
the
heart
then
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
and
looked
with
a
sort
of
terror
at
the
silent
figure
of
cherry
nobody
must
know
that
was
alix
first
clear
thought
she
was
breathing
hard
her
breast
rising
and
falling
painfully
and
the
blood
in
her
temples
began
to
pound
her
mouth
was
dry
with
a
blind
instinct
for
solitude
she
went
quickly
and
silently
from
the
sleeping
porch
and
into
the
warm
sitting
room
the
lamps
were
all
extinguished
but
the
fire
was
still
burning
low
and
pink
where
the
hearts
of
the
logs
had
fallen
apart
to
show
the
flame
for
a
few
minutes
alix
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
chain
that
linked
the
old
brass
fire
dogs
her
elbow
on
the
mantel
and
her
cheek
resting
against
her
arm
no
she
whispered
almost
audibly
no
it
ca
be
that
it
ca
be
cherry
and
peter
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
it
has
been
that
all
the
time
that
all
the
time
and
i
never
knew
it
i
never
dreamed
it
the
end
of
a
log
blazed
up
with
a
sudden
bright
flame
and
in
the
light
it
cast
about
the
quiet
room
alix
glanced
nervously
behind
her
silence
and
shadow
held
the
place
the
bedroom
doors
were
shut
the
fugitive
red
warmth
picked
out
the
backs
of
books
alix
knew
them
all
had
browsed
over
those
shabby
rows
during
a
hundred
winter
nights
touched
the
green
shaded
lamps
and
the
roses
that
were
dropping
their
petals
from
the
crystal
bowl
and
the
polished
legs
of
the
old
mahogany
table
nothing
moved
nothing
stirred
everything
in
the
little
mountain
cabin
was
at
rest
except
the
woman
who
stood
with
aching
heart
and
feverish
mind
resting
her
arm
on
the
level
of
the
low
mantel
and
staring
with
desolate
eyes
into
the
fading
heart
of
the
fire
it
peter
and
cherry
they
have
come
to
care
for
each
other
they
have
come
to
care
for
each
other
she
said
to
herself
her
thoughts
rushing
and
tumbling
in
mad
confusion
as
she
tested
and
tried
the
new
fear
it
must
be
so
but
it
ca
be
so
alix
interrupted
herself
in
terror
for
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
cherry
in
love
with
peter
but
peter
is
my
husband
he
is
my
husband
and
in
a
spasm
of
pain
she
shut
her
eyes
and
flung
her
head
as
if
suffocating
the
beating
of
her
heart
frightened
her
i
shall
be
sick
if
i
go
on
this
way
she
reminded
herself
and
then
they
will
know
they
know
but
peter
she
whispered
suddenly
peter
who
has
always
been
so
good
to
me
so
generous
to
me
and
it
was
cherry
all
the
time
while
we
were
up
here
reading
and
talking
and
her
lips
trembled
and
cooking
she
told
herself
he
was
thinking
of
cherry
he
was
always
thinking
of
cherry
even
those
years
ago
when
we
used
to
tease
him
about
the
lady
with
the
crinolines
and
ringlets
it
was
she
but
why
did
he
ask
her
instead
of
me
wondered
alix
and
with
an
aching
head
and
a
frowning
brow
she
began
to
piece
it
all
together
the
terrible
truth
rose
triumphant
from
all
her
memories
sometimes
for
a
second
hope
would
flood
her
with
almost
painful
joy
but
inevitably
the
truth
shut
down
upon
her
again
and
hope
died
and
she
realized
afresh
that
sorrow
stronger
than
before
was
waiting
to
seize
upon
her
again
sorrow
and
fear
and
pain
these
wrestled
with
her
spirit
that
spirit
that
had
never
known
them
before
she
had
grieved
for
her
father
a
few
years
ago
she
would
always
miss
him
and
need
him
perhaps
never
more
than
but
that
was
natural
loss
softened
by
everything
that
love
and
loyalty
and
faith
could
give
her
and
this
was
a
living
anguish
which
wrung
and
twisted
her
heart
more
terribly
with
every
instant
of
its
realization
well
i
ca
stand
it
in
here
alix
said
suddenly
the
walls
the
peaceful
room
seemed
to
smother
and
stifle
her
she
crossed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
slipped
noiselessly
out
into
the
night
catching
a
coat
from
the
rack
as
she
passed
the
night
was
wrapped
in
an
ocean
fog
there
was
no
moon
and
no
stars
but
the
air
was
soft
and
warm
the
garden
was
so
black
that
alix
familiar
with
every
inch
of
it
as
she
was
groped
her
way
confusedly
between
the
wet
bushes
and
shrubs
roses
drenched
her
with
fog
and
dew
a
springing
erect
as
she
passed
by
sent
a
wave
of
velvety
perfume
into
her
face
when
she
gained
the
woods
she
made
better
progress
for
under
the
great
shafts
of
the
redwoods
there
was
little
growth
and
the
ground
was
unencumbered
and
almost
as
smooth
as
a
floor
with
no
goal
in
view
alix
climbed
upward
walking
rapidly
breathing
hard
and
frequently
speaking
aloud
as
some
poignant
thought
smote
her
or
standing
still
too
sick
with
pain
under
an
unexpected
rush
of
emotion
to
move
sometimes
some
small
woodland
animal
scrambled
noisily
through
the
dry
brush
in
escape
and
now
and
then
an
owl
perhaps
a
mile
away
broke
the
silence
with
a
mournful
and
muffled
cry
tiny
squeaks
and
sleepy
chirps
from
birds
and
chipmunks
recognized
the
disturbance
of
a
stranger
passage
through
the
wood
and
once
the
ugly
snarling
of
always
alert
in
the
night
sounded
suddenly
near
and
then
died
as
suddenly
away
of
these
things
alix
heard
nothing
in
a
trance
of
feverish
dread
she
went
on
and
on
trying
to
escape
from
the
conviction
that
grew
momentarily
more
and
more
clear
he
would
have
told
me
about
it
why
did
i
let
him
ran
thoughts
i
thought
of
some
older
woman
i
do
know
why
anyway
i
did
care
so
much
then
but
i
care
now
peter
i
care
now
i
give
you
up
even
to
cherry
it
is
nonsense
to
talk
of
giving
him
up
alix
told
herself
sitting
down
in
the
inky
dark
on
a
log
against
which
her
wild
walk
had
suddenly
brought
her
for
we
are
all
married
people
and
we
all
love
each
other
but
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
so
sorry
peter
she
whispered
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
him
you
could
help
it
i
know
that
she
is
so
pretty
and
so
sweet
cherry
and
she
turns
to
you
as
if
you
were
her
big
brother
she
sat
motionless
her
hands
clasped
and
raised
so
that
her
cheek
was
pressed
against
them
for
awhile
she
seemed
to
have
no
thoughts
she
was
merely
vaguely
aware
that
the
hands
she
had
plunged
into
the
pockets
of
one
of
peter
old
coats
were
scented
with
tobacco
now
and
so
reminded
her
of
him
she
pressed
them
hard
against
her
face
as
if
to
ease
the
pain
of
her
forehead
but
the
thoughts
exactly
like
a
pain
began
to
creep
back
with
choking
bitterness
it
was
upon
her
again
and
she
got
to
her
feet
and
went
on
what
am
i
thinking
about
it
absurd
ca
people
like
each
other
in
this
world
just
because
they
happen
to
be
married
peter
would
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
me
and
is
it
fair
to
cherry
even
to
think
that
she
would
oh
but
it
true
the
honester
impulse
interrupted
mercilessly
it
is
true
whether
it
right
or
wrong
or
sensible
or
absurd
they
do
love
each
other
that
what
has
changed
them
both
and
she
began
to
remember
a
hundred
a
thousand
trifles
that
made
it
all
hideously
clear
words
glances
moods
subtler
than
either
came
back
to
her
cherry
confusion
of
late
when
the
question
of
her
return
to
martin
was
raised
her
indifference
to
her
inheritance
her
restless
talk
during
one
hour
of
immediate
departure
and
during
the
next
of
an
apparently
termless
visit
all
these
were
significant
now
i
am
desperately
unhappy
cherry
had
said
and
immediately
after
that
alix
recalled
wretchedly
had
come
a
brief
and
apparently
aimless
talk
about
alix
rights
and
her
eagerness
to
share
them
with
her
sister
cherry
had
been
in
misery
of
course
alix
knew
her
too
well
not
to
know
with
what
suffering
she
would
admit
that
the
one
desire
of
her
heart
was
for
something
to
which
alix
had
the
higher
if
not
the
stronger
claim
poor
cherry
the
older
sister
said
aloud
standing
still
for
a
moment
and
pressing
both
hands
over
her
hot
eyes
poor
little
old
cherry
life
has
been
very
kind
to
her
she
and
peter
must
be
so
sorry
and
ashamed
about
this
and
dad
would
be
so
sorry
of
all
things
he
wanted
most
that
cherry
should
be
happy
perhaps
thought
alix
he
realized
that
she
was
that
sort
of
a
nature
she
must
love
and
be
loved
or
she
can
not
live
but
why
did
he
let
her
marry
martin
and
why
was
he
here
to
keep
me
from
marrying
peter
what
a
mess
mess
mess
we
made
of
it
all
as
she
used
the
term
she
realized
that
cherry
had
used
it
too
this
same
evening
and
fresh
conviction
was
added
to
the
great
weight
of
conviction
in
her
heart
she
was
thinking
of
that
alix
told
herself
and
it
has
been
in
peter
mind
all
these
weeks
oh
peter
peter
peter
she
moaned
writhing
as
the
cry
escaped
her
why
could
it
have
been
me
why
could
it
have
been
me
why
could
you
have
loved
me
that
way
i
know
i
am
not
so
pretty
as
cherry
alix
went
on
resuming
her
restless
walk
and
i
know
that
those
things
do
seem
to
mean
as
much
to
me
as
to
most
women
but
peter
she
said
softly
aloud
no
wife
ever
loved
a
man
more
than
i
love
you
my
dear
she
remembered
some
of
his
reproaches
when
he
had
told
her
that
she
loved
him
much
as
she
loved
buck
and
that
in
these
respects
she
was
no
more
than
a
healthy
child
i
may
be
a
child
said
alix
feeling
that
a
dry
flame
was
consuming
her
heart
but
a
child
can
love
my
dear
my
dear
i
wish
i
could
cry
she
said
suddenly
finding
herself
sitting
on
a
log
where
low
oaks
met
the
forest
and
the
open
meadows
and
where
they
had
often
paused
in
mountain
climbs
to
look
far
across
the
panorama
of
hills
and
valley
below
but
now
we
must
face
this
thing
sensibly
what
is
to
be
done
they
must
not
know
that
i
know
and
in
some
way
we
must
get
out
of
this
tangle
even
if
peter
were
free
cherry
would
not
be
free
she
decided
and
so
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
help
them
until
it
dies
away
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
stabbed
her
although
she
remembered
martin
and
his
strange
tale
of
a
message
and
wondered
about
it
a
little
in
her
thoughts
to
whom
had
cherry
been
sending
that
telegram
if
not
to
peter
and
if
to
peter
why
had
she
not
simply
telephoned
because
she
had
known
that
peter
was
not
in
his
office
because
she
had
been
going
to
meet
him
somewhere
but
where
well
at
the
boat
martin
had
heard
her
tell
the
boy
that
he
must
catch
that
boat
alix
did
not
guess
the
truth
but
she
guessed
enough
to
make
her
feel
frightened
and
sick
she
could
not
suppose
that
cherry
and
peter
had
planned
to
go
away
on
that
boat
together
because
at
most
her
thoughts
would
have
grasped
the
idea
of
one
or
two
days
absence
only
and
they
had
given
her
no
warning
of
that
but
until
this
instant
the
thought
of
the
passionate
desire
that
enveloped
them
had
not
reached
her
she
had
imagined
cherry
feeling
for
peter
to
be
something
only
a
little
stronger
than
her
own
now
she
thought
of
cherry
beauty
her
fragrance
and
softness
the
shine
in
her
blue
eyes
and
the
light
on
her
hair
and
knew
that
life
for
them
all
of
late
had
been
mined
with
frightful
danger
cherry
would
be
disgraced
and
martin
martin
would
kill
her
if
he
found
her
out
oh
my
little
sister
she
would
be
town
talk
she
is
so
reckless
she
would
do
anything
she
would
be
a
public
scandal
and
the
papers
would
have
her
pictures
dad
little
charity
oh
dad
she
said
looking
up
into
the
dark
tell
me
what
to
do
i
need
you
so
wo
you
somehow
tell
me
what
to
do
silence
and
darkness
but
even
in
the
gloom
alix
could
tell
that
fog
was
lifting
and
a
sudden
sweep
of
breeze
like
a
tired
breath
went
over
the
tops
of
the
redwoods
steadily
came
the
change
the
darkness
by
imperceptible
degrees
lifted
the
world
grew
gray
as
if
with
moonshine
trees
and
bushes
began
to
stand
out
dimly
from
the
mass
of
shadows
on
the
road
below
her
alix
heard
a
wagon
rattle
the
wagon
from
the
portuguese
dairy
upon
the
ridge
and
past
her
leaving
a
dark
wake
of
brushed
dewdrops
on
the
pearled
grass
a
cottontail
fled
silently
she
noted
with
surprise
that
she
could
see
the
grass
now
although
it
had
been
invisible
a
few
moments
ago
she
could
see
it
and
presently
its
brownness
showed
and
the
rich
solid
green
of
the
oaks
lifted
from
the
dull
twilight
that
had
enveloped
the
world
light
alix
whispered
awestruck
and
a
few
moments
later
she
added
dawn
it
was
dawn
indeed
that
was
creeping
into
the
valley
and
as
it
brightened
and
deepened
and
warmed
momentarily
alix
felt
some
of
the
peace
and
glory
of
it
swelling
in
her
tired
heart
the
sky
grew
pale
grew
white
gradually
turned
to
blue
and
the
little
clouds
drifting
across
it
vanished
lost
in
a
swimming
vapour
of
pink
and
pearl
suddenly
a
first
shaft
of
sunlight
struck
across
the
mountain
ridge
and
lay
bright
on
the
hilltop
opposite
the
fog
that
still
clung
to
the
peak
of
the
mountain
was
steadily
ascending
into
the
brilliant
air
dew
sparkled
and
the
hoary
lichened
limbs
of
the
sprawling
oaks
glistened
in
the
light
the
sun
came
up
and
alix
felt
the
blessed
warmth
against
her
chilled
and
cramped
shoulders
and
stretched
her
arms
out
to
welcome
the
flood
of
brightness
and
new
courage
after
the
darkness
and
doubts
of
the
night
she
was
still
sitting
on
the
log
dreamily
watching
the
expanding
beauty
of
the
new
day
when
there
was
a
crashing
in
the
underbrush
behind
her
and
wild
with
joy
and
with
twigs
and
dried
brown
grasses
on
his
wet
coat
buck
came
bounding
out
of
the
forest
and
leaped
upon
her
bucky
she
faltered
as
he
stood
beside
her
his
quick
tongue
flashing
ecstatically
close
to
her
face
every
splendid
muscle
of
his
body
wriggling
with
eager
affection
did
you
miss
me
old
fellow
did
you
come
to
find
me
she
had
not
cried
during
the
long
vigil
of
the
night
when
a
storm
had
raged
in
her
heart
and
had
left
her
weak
and
sick
with
dread
but
there
was
peace
now
and
alix
locked
her
arms
about
the
shoulders
and
laid
her
face
against
his
satiny
head
and
cried
chapter
xxi
when
cherry
came
out
to
breakfast
a
few
hours
later
she
found
alix
already
at
the
porch
table
alix
looked
pale
but
fresh
and
trim
she
had
evidently
just
tubbed
and
she
wore
one
of
the
plain
ginghams
that
were
extremely
becoming
to
her
rather
boyish
type
she
looked
up
and
nodded
at
cherry
composedly
cherry
always
kissed
her
sister
in
the
morning
but
she
did
not
she
felt
troubled
and
ashamed
and
instinctively
avoided
the
little
caress
no
men
she
asked
sharing
her
grapefruit
with
her
mail
peter
had
to
go
to
san
rafael
with
thomas
in
his
car
to
do
something
about
the
case
alix
explained
i
drove
them
down
and
at
the
last
minute
martin
decided
to
go
so
i
marketed
and
got
the
mail
and
came
back
and
the
understanding
is
that
we
are
to
meet
them
at
the
francis
for
dinner
at
six
and
go
to
the
orpheum
is
it
almost
ten
cherry
said
sleepily
gazing
in
surprise
at
the
clock
that
was
visible
through
the
open
door
i
terribly
ashamed
and
when
did
you
get
up
and
silently
make
your
bed
and
hang
up
your
things
oh
early
alix
answered
noncommittally
i
had
a
bath
and
this
is
my
second
breakfast
cherry
who
was
reading
a
letter
did
not
hear
her
now
she
made
some
inarticulate
sound
that
made
alix
look
at
her
in
quick
concern
cherry
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
for
answer
cherry
tossed
her
the
letter
written
on
a
thick
sheet
of
lavender
paper
which
diffused
a
strong
odour
of
scent
read
that
she
said
briefly
and
with
a
desperate
air
she
dropped
her
head
on
the
table
and
knotted
her
hands
high
above
it
fearfully
alix
picked
up
the
perfumed
sheet
and
read
in
a
coarse
and
sprawling
yet
unmistakably
feminine
handwriting
the
following
words
dear
lloyd
perhaps
you
would
not
feel
so
pleased
with
yourself
if
you
knew
the
real
reason
why
your
husband
left
red
creek
it
was
because
of
a
quarrel
he
had
with
hatty
woods
if
you
do
believe
it
you
had
better
ask
him
about
some
of
the
parties
he
had
with
joe
king
crowd
and
where
they
were
on
the
night
of
august
and
if
he
knows
anybody
named
hatty
woods
and
see
what
he
says
ask
him
if
he
ever
heard
of
bopps
hotel
and
when
he
was
in
sacramento
last
if
he
denies
it
you
can
show
him
this
letter
there
was
no
signature
alix
who
had
read
it
first
with
a
bewildered
and
suspicious
look
read
it
again
and
flushed
deeply
at
the
sordid
shame
of
it
she
laid
it
down
and
looked
in
stunned
conviction
at
her
sister
cherry
who
was
breathing
hard
raised
her
head
rested
her
chin
on
her
hands
elbows
on
the
table
and
stared
at
alix
defiantly
there
she
said
almost
with
triumph
there
now
is
that
so
easy
now
am
i
to
just
smile
and
agree
and
say
martin
course
martin
dear
now
you
see
now
you
see
now
am
i
to
bear
that
she
rushed
on
her
words
suddenly
violent
and
go
on
with
him
as
his
wife
when
a
common
woman
like
that
cherry
dear
alix
said
distressedly
ah
well
you
ca
realize
it
nobody
but
the
woman
to
whom
it
happens
can
cherry
interrupted
her
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
but
let
him
say
what
he
pleases
now
she
added
passionately
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
i
follow
my
own
course
from
on
alix
watching
her
fearfully
was
amazed
at
the
change
in
her
eyes
were
blazing
her
cheeks
pale
her
voice
was
dry
and
feverish
and
there
was
a
sort
of
frenzy
in
her
manner
that
alix
had
never
seen
before
to
bring
sunny
little
cherry
to
this
to
change
the
radiant
innocent
child
that
had
been
cherry
into
this
bitter
and
disillusioned
woman
alix
felt
as
if
the
whole
world
were
going
mad
and
as
if
life
would
never
be
sane
and
serene
again
for
any
one
of
them
cherry
do
you
believe
it
she
asked
cherry
roused
from
a
moment
of
brooding
silence
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
oh
of
course
i
believe
it
she
answered
but
darling
we
do
even
know
who
wrote
it
we
have
only
this
woman
word
for
it
oh
look
at
it
look
at
it
alix
cherry
burst
forth
do
decent
men
have
letters
like
that
sent
to
their
wives
is
it
probable
that
a
good
man
would
do
anything
to
rouse
some
busybody
woman
to
write
such
a
letter
about
him
well
but
who
is
she
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
wrote
it
for
alix
wondered
oh
i
do
know
she
got
mad
at
him
perhaps
or
perhaps
she
is
a
champion
of
this
woods
woman
they
had
some
quarrel
how
do
know
but
you
can
see
that
she
is
mad
and
this
is
the
way
she
gets
even
cherry
at
least
do
martin
the
justice
to
ask
him
about
it
alix
pleaded
really
frightened
now
her
sister
seemed
not
to
hear
her
she
stopped
her
angry
pacing
and
sat
down
at
the
table
and
the
misery
in
her
beautiful
eyes
made
heart
sink
and
that
cherry
said
in
a
whisper
is
my
husband
she
paused
staring
down
at
the
table
one
hand
supporting
her
forehead
the
other
wandering
idly
among
the
breakfast
things
her
look
was
sombre
and
far
away
alix
standing
watched
her
distressedly
through
a
long
minute
of
silence
well
cherry
said
lifelessly
looking
up
at
her
sister
with
dulled
eyes
what
now
it
still
better
or
worse
i
suppose
alix
sat
down
and
for
a
moment
covered
her
face
with
a
hand
when
she
took
it
away
there
was
new
serenity
and
resolution
in
her
tired
face
no
she
said
with
a
great
sigh
i
think
perhaps
you
right
he
has
he
should
have
no
claim
on
you
now
alix
cherry
demanded
would
you
forgive
him
perhaps
i
would
alix
said
after
thought
perhaps
you
would
cherry
echoed
incredulously
well
i
not
very
good
alix
said
hesitatingly
but
a
vow
is
a
vow
you
know
if
it
was
limited
then
my
my
fulfillment
of
it
would
be
limited
i
suppose
of
course
she
added
honestly
i
talking
for
myself
only
and
you
would
quietly
forgive
and
forget
demanded
the
little
sister
in
bitter
scorn
i
say
i
hope
i
would
alix
corrected
her
even
if
this
is
true
she
added
with
a
glance
at
the
lavender
letter
still
i
suppose
the
rule
of
forgiving
seventy
times
seven
times
cherry
interrupted
her
with
a
burst
of
bitter
and
rebellious
weeping
oh
my
god
what
shall
i
do
she
sobbed
with
her
bright
head
dropped
on
her
arm
alix
saw
kow
come
to
the
door
look
at
them
speculatively
and
disappear
and
thought
in
her
shaken
soul
that
things
in
a
household
were
demoralized
indeed
when
pretense
before
the
servants
was
no
longer
maintained
do
cry
cherry
cherry
she
said
her
own
tears
brimming
over
she
came
to
kneel
beside
her
sister
and
they
locked
their
arms
about
each
other
and
their
wet
cheeks
touched
do
cry
dear
she
said
tenderly
it
all
come
straight
somehow
and
we
wonder
why
we
took
it
so
hard
the
thing
that
breaks
my
heart
sobbed
cherry
clinging
tight
is
that
it
is
all
my
fault
oh
no
it
not
cherry
you
were
too
young
and
it
only
one
of
so
many
thousands
of
unhappy
marriages
alix
argued
soothingly
now
listen
to
me
sis
she
began
briskly
as
soon
as
cherry
had
somewhat
regained
her
composure
we
ascertain
about
this
letter
that
only
fair
if
martin
denies
it
of
course
he
deny
it
cherry
interrupted
from
the
bitter
knowledge
she
had
of
him
alix
again
felt
daunted
for
a
second
by
the
sheer
ugliness
and
sordidness
of
the
matter
but
she
returned
to
the
charge
bravely
suppose
we
get
peter
to
ask
him
she
suggested
suddenly
peter
has
a
wonderful
way
of
getting
the
truth
out
of
people
poor
cherry
the
very
mention
of
his
name
makes
her
wince
alix
thought
watching
her
sister
sorrowfully
if
martin
can
convince
peter
that
it
is
not
true
then
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
she
added
aloud
then
you
tell
martin
frankly
that
you
have
the
old
house
ready
to
live
in
and
you
want
to
live
there
he
he
never
agree
to
that
cherry
said
shaking
her
head
but
if
this
is
true
she
asked
again
indicating
the
letter
then
tell
him
that
unless
he
agrees
absolutely
to
a
separation
alix
said
that
you
will
get
a
divorce
and
live
here
alone
under
that
sort
of
a
cloud
cherry
said
with
watering
eyes
oh
well
she
said
rising
and
going
toward
the
door
it
horrible
horrible
horrible
whatever
i
do
what
is
your
idea
that
we
should
dine
and
go
to
the
orpheum
tonight
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
let
all
this
wait
until
you
can
ask
peter
to
martin
i
wonder
if
martin
would
tell
me
alix
mused
he
tell
you
sooner
than
peter
cherry
prophesied
why
could
i
pretend
that
i
opened
that
letter
by
mistake
alix
said
thoughtfully
and
frighten
him
into
admitting
it
if
it
true
you
could
cherry
admitted
lifelessly
but
you
may
be
sure
it
is
true
enough
she
added
then
leave
it
to
me
alix
said
and
do
feel
too
sad
cherry
you
young
and
life
may
take
a
turn
that
changes
everything
for
you
you
always
have
peter
peter
and
me
back
of
you
alix
you
the
best
sister
a
girl
ever
had
cherry
said
passionately
putting
her
hand
on
alix
shoulder
i
wish
i
were
as
big
as
you
are
and
he
made
me
so
wretched
whispered
cherry
with
trembling
lips
that
sometimes
i
been
sick
of
life
but
i
will
investigate
this
letter
and
if
it
not
true
i
try
again
alix
i
go
away
with
him
if
he
wants
me
to
or
i
live
here
and
study
french
and
go
to
lectures
with
you
you
darling
alix
said
with
an
aching
heart
and
they
smiled
through
tears
as
they
kissed
each
other
that
night
it
was
simply
managed
that
martin
should
be
next
to
alix
in
the
loge
at
the
theatre
and
she
began
to
question
him
seriously
at
once
all
through
the
strange
unnatural
day
that
followed
her
night
of
vigil
she
had
been
planning
what
she
should
say
to
him
but
she
and
cherry
had
not
spoken
of
the
subject
again
cherry
had
dressed
herself
with
her
usual
dainty
care
and
now
with
the
violets
alix
had
given
her
spraying
in
a
great
purple
bunch
at
her
breast
and
her
blue
eyes
ringed
and
thoughtful
under
her
soft
little
feathered
hat
she
was
so
arrestingly
lovely
that
alix
was
well
aware
of
the
admiring
glances
from
all
sides
to
which
she
was
so
superbly
indifferent
martin
alix
began
i
read
a
letter
intended
for
cherry
this
morning
i
i
open
all
the
mail
she
had
to
repeat
it
twice
before
he
realized
that
there
was
something
behind
her
earnest
and
significant
tone
then
she
saw
him
stop
twisting
his
program
and
veer
about
toward
her
she
murmured
a
question
do
i
what
he
asked
in
an
undertone
instantly
lowered
do
you
know
a
girl
named
hatty
woods
alix
repeated
cautiously
all
hope
died
when
she
saw
his
face
he
shot
her
a
quick
suspicious
look
and
his
big
mouth
trembled
with
a
scornful
and
contemptuous
smile
and
he
looked
away
indifferently
then
he
faced
her
on
guard
what
about
her
he
asked
almost
inaudibly
somebody
wrote
this
letter
about
her
alix
stated
quietly
who
wrote
you
about
her
what
she
say
he
demanded
quickly
just
i
let
you
see
it
she
said
i
do
know
who
wrote
it
it
was
signed
do
you
do
you
know
her
do
you
know
hatty
woods
martin
smiled
again
a
superior
yet
ugly
smile
it
was
the
look
of
a
man
approached
in
his
own
realm
threatened
in
his
infallible
fastness
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
girls
like
hatty
the
better
he
told
her
you
got
plenty
to
do
without
mixing
up
with
her
she
said
alix
began
the
letter
said
oh
sure
i
know
what
she
say
martin
conceded
furious
at
interference
trembling
with
anger
and
resentment
and
only
anxious
to
close
the
conversation
i
know
all
about
her
and
her
kind
i
think
i
know
who
wrote
that
letter
too
i
guess
joe
king
wife
knows
something
about
it
they
all
alike
you
give
it
to
me
and
i
manage
it
there
wo
be
any
more
martin
alix
whispered
gravely
if
you
have
given
cherry
any
cause
her
voice
fell
and
there
was
a
silence
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
life
that
you
do
understand
my
dear
martin
said
reluctantly
nettled
but
still
maintaining
his
air
of
lofty
superiority
a
man
life
is
not
a
woman
is
intended
to
be
if
this
woman
says
she
has
anything
on
me
she
said
that
you
went
to
a
place
called
bopps
hotel
in
sacramento
alix
began
but
he
interrupted
her
oh
she
did
did
she
he
said
furiously
yet
always
in
a
cautious
undertone
well
now
i
tell
you
something
she
going
to
have
a
nice
time
proving
that
and
you
can
tell
your
sister
if
this
is
a
that
i
fight
hatty
woods
and
fifty
hatty
woods
i
martin
for
heaven
sake
alix
warned
him
as
she
pressed
her
violets
against
her
face
well
he
said
surlily
now
you
know
how
i
feel
about
it
martin
alix
pleaded
feeling
that
her
last
hope
was
sinking
away
from
her
can
you
deny
her
story
he
was
silent
while
a
beaming
young
jewess
in
an
outrageous
gown
took
an
encore
for
her
song
and
dance
then
he
turned
again
toward
alix
with
the
smile
she
had
learned
to
hate
you
get
cherry
to
deny
that
she
never
lost
a
chance
to
beat
it
away
from
home
ever
since
she
was
married
he
said
you
get
her
to
deny
that
she
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
she
never
wanted
children
that
her
marriage
was
a
mistake
you
ask
her
to
show
you
the
letters
i
written
her
asking
her
to
come
back
and
then
i
show
you
the
answers
i
got
mart
alix
said
sharply
there
no
use
in
your
taking
that
tone
with
me
i
simply
sick
over
the
whole
affair
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
i
would
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
to
straighten
it
out
she
paused
arrested
by
some
sudden
thought
i
tell
you
i
would
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
to
help
she
said
again
in
quieter
tones
but
taking
that
attitude
will
do
no
good
if
this
poor
girl
this
hatty
i
tell
you
to
leave
hatty
out
of
it
martin
said
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
let
the
whole
thing
alone
but
she
saw
that
he
was
both
nervous
and
apprehensive
and
she
knew
that
the
inference
she
and
cherry
had
drawn
from
the
letter
was
a
true
one
does
cherry
know
anything
of
this
martin
presently
muttered
do
you
want
her
to
alix
asked
pointedly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
great
assumption
of
indifference
if
she
wants
to
have
it
all
dragged
to
light
why
she
can
go
ahead
he
remarked
carelessly
i
left
red
creek
and
as
i
tell
you
that
woman
will
never
write
another
letter
for
i
know
the
way
to
shut
her
up
and
i
intend
to
do
it
but
if
you
and
cherry
want
the
whole
thing
aired
in
public
why
go
ahead
i
not
stopping
you
at
least
i
think
you
ought
to
let
cherry
lead
her
own
life
after
this
alix
countered
with
spirit
live
in
your
old
house
eh
he
asked
resentfully
as
he
flipped
the
pages
of
his
program
with
a
big
thumb
and
stared
at
it
with
unseeing
eyes
what
does
she
want
to
live
there
for
the
fact
remains
that
she
does
alix
persisted
yes
and
have
just
as
good
a
time
as
if
she
never
had
been
married
at
all
he
said
you
know
alix
was
beginning
the
denial
that
she
had
given
him
so
confidently
last
night
but
she
interrupted
herself
and
stopped
short
the
conviction
rushed
upon
her
in
an
overwhelming
wave
that
she
had
no
right
to
repeat
that
denial
now
that
the
last
dreadful
hours
had
changed
the
whole
situation
and
that
she
herself
had
better
reason
to
suspect
cherry
than
either
martin
or
his
gossiping
aunt
she
sat
sick
and
silent
unable
to
speak
again
thinking
only
that
it
was
peter
that
lloyd
had
seen
with
cherry
that
day
and
that
there
must
have
been
something
in
their
attitude
that
revealed
their
secret
even
to
her
first
casual
look
the
vaudeville
show
whirled
and
crashed
and
rattled
on
its
way
martin
applauded
heartily
but
involuntarily
alix
applauded
mechanically
their
conversation
was
closed
meanwhile
cherry
and
peter
had
their
first
opportunity
to
speak
to
each
other
alone
it
occurred
to
neither
of
them
that
it
was
strange
to
find
this
chance
in
the
rustling
darkness
of
the
big
vaudeville
house
with
several
thousand
of
persons
pressing
all
about
them
to
both
the
thirst
for
speech
was
a
burning
necessity
and
it
was
with
an
almost
dizzy
sense
of
relief
that
cherry
turned
to
him
with
her
first
words
peter
i
do
dare
say
much
can
you
hear
me
perfectly
he
answered
looking
at
his
folded
program
peter
i
been
thinking
about
our
plan
i
mean
martin
plans
to
go
on
monday
but
something
has
happened
since
i
saw
you
this
morning
something
that
makes
a
difference
i
had
a
letter
a
letter
from
some
woman
connecting
his
name
with
another
woman
a
hatty
woods
notorious
in
red
creek
and
this
joe
king
crowd
that
he
went
with
i
do
know
who
wrote
the
letter
or
why
she
wrote
she
said
hastily
as
peter
interpolated
a
question
and
i
do
care
i
have
spoken
to
martin
about
it
but
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
and
of
course
it
makes
a
difference
to
us
to
you
and
me
as
far
as
martin
goes
i
am
free
now
what
is
justice
to
martin
and
kindness
to
martin
will
never
count
with
me
any
more
peter
wasted
no
words
his
face
was
thoughtful
he
goes
monday
he
said
we
can
go
sunday
does
the
boat
sail
sunday
i
am
sure
of
it
this
is
thursday
night
your
suitcase
i
checked
again
yesterday
was
it
only
yesterday
that
all
we
would
have
been
on
the
train
cherry
flying
toward
new
orleans
her
small
hand
gripped
his
in
the
darkness
if
we
only
were
he
heard
her
breathe
he
turned
to
her
so
exquisite
in
her
distress
her
breast
was
rising
and
falling
quickly
patience
sweetheart
he
said
patience
for
only
a
few
days
more
i
make
the
arrangements
sunday
is
only
two
days
off
sunday
will
be
day
after
day
after
she
said
whimsically
is
sunday
the
best
day
he
questioned
thoughtfully
oh
much
the
best
cherry
said
her
whole
face
glowing
suddenly
you
see
it
already
arranged
that
i
come
in
to
the
olivers
saturday
night
and
help
them
get
ready
for
their
tea
on
sunday
alix
is
to
stay
in
the
valley
and
play
the
organ
sunday
morning
and
come
in
with
martin
at
ten
i
suppose
i
have
to
come
when
they
do
he
mused
but
is
there
that
breakfast
at
the
club
on
sunday
cherry
asked
porter
breakfast
yes
but
i
not
going
to
that
peter
said
stupidly
could
you
say
that
you
were
she
supplied
simply
yes
by
george
he
agreed
brightening
that
fixes
me
but
now
how
about
you
why
i
am
at
the
olivers
she
reminded
him
all
i
have
to
do
is
walk
out
of
the
house
at
ten
their
eyes
met
in
a
wild
rush
of
triumph
and
hope
this
time
we
shall
do
it
peter
said
your
suitcase
i
have
you
have
money
oh
plenty
martin
thinks
you
go
with
him
monday
eh
i
hardly
know
what
he
thinks
she
answered
with
a
fluttered
air
i
hardly
known
what
i
was
doing
or
saying
he
was
to
go
you
know
but
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
to
get
the
whole
house
in
perfect
order
in
case
alix
should
ever
find
a
tenant
we
worked
like
beavers
there
i
know
you
have
he
smiled
down
at
her
peter
kind
and
radiant
smile
after
day
after
day
after
he
said
i
shall
see
to
it
that
you
never
work
too
hard
again
oh
peter
you
never
be
sorry
she
whispered
sorry
my
dearest
child
when
you
give
your
beauty
and
your
youth
to
a
man
almost
twice
your
age
who
has
loved
you
all
your
life
do
you
think
there
is
much
chance
of
it
why
should
it
be
one
of
the
happy
marriages
said
cherry
after
a
silence
it
will
he
answered
confidently
my
dearest
girl
i
know
something
of
life
and
its
disappointments
and
disillusionments
and
i
tell
you
that
i
know
that
every
hour
you
and
i
have
together
is
going
to
be
more
wonderful
than
the
hour
before
i
tell
you
that
as
the
weeks
become
months
and
the
months
become
years
and
the
beauty
and
miracle
of
it
go
on
and
on
we
will
think
that
what
we
feel
for
each
other
now
is
only
the
shadow
the
dream
but
the
beginning
will
be
wonderful
enough
cherry
mused
you
and
i
breakfasting
together
walking
together
talking
together
always
just
we
two
but
peter
she
said
suddenly
one
of
us
might
die
ah
that
he
conceded
soberly
that
it
all
i
afraid
of
now
i
am
terribly
afraid
of
it
said
cherry
beginning
to
tremble
if
you
should
die
now
before
sunday
i
never
thought
of
it
before
you
must
think
of
it
now
and
i
wo
he
said
quickly
why
we
have
only
two
days
to
wait
only
two
she
echoed
nervously
i
promised
him
that
i
would
write
to
his
mother
about
our
coming
you
talk
as
if
you
meant
to
go
with
martin
he
said
smiling
i
know
i
do
sometimes
and
that
one
of
the
things
that
worries
me
she
answered
quickly
so
many
things
have
happened
and
i
get
so
confused
thinking
she
went
on
that
i
am
all
mixed
most
of
the
time
i
arrange
one
thing
as
if
i
were
going
to
do
what
martin
thinks
i
am
go
with
him
to
portland
i
mean
at
another
time
i
get
into
long
talks
with
alix
of
what
divorces
would
mean
and
all
the
time
i
am
straining
toward
you
and
escape
from
it
all
it
worries
and
frightens
and
puzzles
me
so
she
confided
raising
her
lovely
eyes
to
him
that
i
am
almost
afraid
to
speak
at
all
for
fear
of
betraying
myself
do
speak
at
all
then
he
answered
smiling
whimsically
shall
i
just
let
him
think
i
am
quietly
going
away
with
him
on
monday
she
asked
after
a
silence
in
which
she
was
deeply
thinking
does
he
know
you
had
that
letter
peter
said
no
alix
is
going
to
speak
to
him
about
it
cherry
outlined
the
talk
that
she
and
her
sister
had
had
at
breakfast
then
i
should
bring
up
the
question
at
all
peter
decided
quickly
it
would
only
mean
an
ugly
and
unnecessary
scene
if
you
were
going
to
be
here
it
would
be
very
different
even
then
you
might
have
to
face
a
terrible
publicity
and
unpleasantness
but
as
it
is
much
wiser
to
let
him
continue
to
think
that
you
do
know
anything
about
it
and
to
let
alix
think
that
you
are
ignoring
the
whole
thing
until
sunday
she
whispered
until
sunday
peter
glanced
at
martin
and
alix
who
were
talking
together
absorbedly
in
low
tones
my
little
sweetheart
i
make
all
this
misery
up
to
you
he
whispered
her
little
hand
was
locked
in
his
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
vaudeville
performance
ended
and
they
went
out
into
the
cool
night
decided
against
a
supper
found
the
car
where
alix
had
parked
it
in
a
quiet
side
street
and
made
their
way
to
the
ferry
and
so
home
under
the
dark
low
arch
of
a
starless
and
moonless
sky
cherry
shared
the
driver
seat
with
her
sister
they
spoke
occasionally
on
the
long
drive
everybody
was
weary
and
silent
alix
racing
between
sausalito
low
hills
and
the
dark
odorous
marshes
wondered
if
in
the
packed
theatre
any
other
four
hearts
had
borne
the
burden
that
these
four
were
bearing
the
car
flew
on
its
way
the
men
in
the
back
seat
occasionally
exchanged
brief
indifferent
remarks
cherry
staring
straight
ahead
of
her
neither
moved
nor
spoke
and
alix
at
the
wheel
watching
the
road
and
the
lights
keenly
and
listening
to
the
complicated
breathing
of
the
machinery
resumed
again
the
endless
chain
of
thought
peter
cherry
martin
dad
the
few
people
with
whom
her
life
concerned
wheeled
in
unceasing
confusion
through
her
brain
and
always
it
was
herself
alix
who
would
have
died
for
them
who
must
somehow
find
the
solution
morning
came
a
crystal
autumn
morning
and
life
went
on
peter
and
martin
went
away
before
cherry
came
out
to
the
porch
to
find
her
breakfast
waiting
and
alix
in
striped
blue
linen
cutting
food
for
the
ducks
the
peaceful
day
went
by
and
if
there
was
any
change
at
the
cabin
it
was
a
change
for
the
better
alix
who
had
been
silent
and
troubled
for
a
little
while
was
more
serene
now
as
usual
concerned
for
the
comfort
of
her
household
and
as
usual
busy
all
day
long
with
her
poultry
and
pigeons
her
stable
and
dogs
peter
was
his
courteous
gentle
interested
self
more
like
the
old
peter
who
had
always
been
occupied
with
his
music
and
his
books
than
like
the
passionately
metamorphosed
peter
who
had
been
so
changed
by
love
for
cherry
martin
satisfied
with
the
general
respects
and
consideration
with
which
he
found
himself
surrounded
accepted
life
placidly
enough
perhaps
he
had
been
disturbed
by
the
advent
of
the
letter
perhaps
he
was
willing
to
let
the
question
of
an
adjustment
between
cherry
and
himself
rest
if
she
had
been
innocently
indiscreet
he
had
also
yielded
to
temptation
not
so
innocently
and
although
martin
was
not
a
man
to
consider
the
question
of
morals
between
the
sexes
as
evenly
balanced
still
he
had
winced
very
uncomfortably
under
and
was
not
anxious
to
reopen
the
subject
let
be
martin
said
to
himself
contentedly
as
he
ate
slept
and
smoked
his
endless
cigars
chatted
with
peter
followed
alix
about
the
farmyard
and
expressed
an
occasional
opinion
that
was
considerately
received
by
the
others
it
amused
him
to
help
get
the
house
ready
for
a
tenant
and
from
the
fact
that
cherry
talked
no
more
of
living
there
and
made
no
comment
upon
his
frequent
reference
to
their
departure
on
monday
he
deduced
that
she
had
come
to
her
senses
cherry
too
was
less
unhappy
than
she
had
been
by
avoiding
peter
by
refraining
even
in
words
and
looks
from
the
companionship
for
which
she
so
hungered
by
devoting
herself
to
alix
she
managed
to
hold
her
feelings
tightly
in
leash
it
cost
her
dear
for
sometimes
the
thought
of
what
she
was
about
to
do
swept
her
with
a
feeling
of
agony
and
faintness
hard
to
conceal
and
the
need
for
perpetual
watchfulness
was
exhausting
to
body
and
spirit
but
even
though
alix
found
that
the
knowledge
of
the
secret
they
shared
without
ever
mentioning
stood
between
them
like
a
screen
the
sisters
busy
about
the
house
had
wonderful
hours
together
saturday
came
a
perfect
day
that
filled
the
little
valley
to
the
brim
with
golden
sunshine
the
mountain
swam
in
a
pale
haze
of
the
sky
was
soft
unclouded
faintly
azure
in
the
forest
about
the
old
strickland
house
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
alix
driving
alone
to
the
mountain
cabin
stared
in
the
morning
freshness
at
the
blue
overhead
and
said
aloud
oh
what
a
day
of
gold
the
dog
sitting
beside
her
on
the
front
seat
flapped
his
tail
in
answer
to
her
voice
and
she
laughed
at
him
but
the
laugh
was
quickly
followed
by
a
sharp
sigh
saturday
she
mused
and
martin
expects
cherry
to
go
with
him
on
monday
expects
her
to
go
back
with
him
to
a
life
of
misery
for
her
existence
with
a
man
she
hates
oh
cherry
my
little
sister
there
can
be
no
happiness
for
you
there
and
peter
peter
is
left
behind
to
me
who
can
not
comfort
him
or
still
the
ache
that
is
tearing
his
heart
my
two
loved
ones
and
what
can
i
do
to
help
them
driving
slowly
on
the
noiseless
she
looked
up
at
the
great
brown
shafts
of
the
trees
through
which
the
roadway
wound
like
a
shelf
streaks
of
sunlight
filtered
through
them
the
september
air
was
soft
and
sweet
the
forest
was
like
an
old
friend
to
alix
and
the
time
she
spent
in
it
was
always
her
quietest
time
the
tempered
light
the
air
scented
with
piney
sweetness
the
delicate
summer
humming
of
tiny
forest
voices
the
brief
snap
of
twigs
and
the
rustling
of
tiny
bodies
in
the
underbrush
these
made
the
world
in
which
she
was
most
at
home
oh
why
ca
we
always
be
like
children
just
happy
to
be
free
she
mused
as
she
left
the
forest
and
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
how
happy
we
used
to
be
playing
in
these
woods
and
going
home
tired
and
hungry
to
dad
and
supper
buck
she
said
aloud
a
dog
is
happier
than
a
man
and
perhaps
and
alix
smiled
her
whimsical
smile
as
the
car
moved
under
the
last
oaks
and
was
brought
to
a
standstill
close
to
the
house
perhaps
a
tree
is
the
happiest
of
all
she
had
come
up
to
the
cabin
to
do
the
usual
last
little
daily
fussing
among
the
ducks
and
chickens
and
to
bring
peter
if
peter
had
not
gone
into
town
back
with
her
to
cherry
house
they
had
all
dined
in
the
old
strickland
house
the
night
before
and
because
of
a
sudden
rainfall
had
decided
to
spend
the
night
there
too
the
chinese
boy
who
had
been
helping
the
sisters
with
their
housecleaning
had
been
persuaded
to
cook
the
dinner
and
get
breakfast
and
the
evening
about
the
old
fireplace
had
been
almost
too
poignantly
sweet
martin
who
had
been
mixing
cocktails
liked
the
role
of
host
and
to
the
other
three
every
inch
of
the
house
was
full
of
happy
memories
softened
and
saddened
by
all
that
had
happened
since
the
old
days
by
all
that
they
knew
and
felt
now
and
accompanied
by
the
softly
dripping
rain
on
the
roof
and
eaves
as
by
a
plaintive
obbligato
but
suddenly
at
about
ten
peter
had
surprised
them
all
by
getting
to
his
feet
he
was
going
up
to
the
cabin
he
said
must
go
in
fact
in
all
the
rain
they
had
protested
in
all
the
rain
he
answered
shaking
himself
into
his
coat
he
liked
rain
he
would
rather
walk
please
he
told
alix
when
she
offered
to
drive
him
up
in
the
car
bewildered
and
a
little
apprehensive
she
let
him
go
to
cherry
who
seemed
to
feel
suddenly
sad
and
uneasy
alix
laughed
about
it
but
she
was
secretly
worried
herself
and
immediately
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
decided
to
run
up
to
the
cabin
in
the
car
and
assure
herself
that
everything
was
right
there
cherry
who
had
not
slept
and
who
was
pale
had
come
out
to
the
car
her
distracted
manner
increasing
alix
sense
that
something
was
gravely
amiss
the
sisters
had
loitered
at
the
car
a
moment
in
the
exquisite
morning
freshness
remember
the
day
the
rose
vine
came
down
and
you
crawled
through
it
alix
had
asked
looking
back
at
the
house
oh
do
cherry
had
protested
faintly
why
not
her
sister
had
asked
tenderly
reproachful
oh
because
it
makes
me
so
sad
to
think
how
happy
we
were
cherry
had
answered
making
an
effort
to
speak
lightly
it
such
a
glorious
morning
she
had
added
i
wish
i
were
going
to
drive
up
with
you
why
do
you
alix
had
said
eagerly
oh
too
much
to
do
here
cherry
had
answered
vaguely
she
had
looked
at
her
sister
as
if
she
would
like
to
speak
smiled
uncertainly
and
had
gone
back
to
the
house
alix
had
started
on
her
trip
with
a
heavy
heart
but
the
run
soothed
her
in
spite
of
herself
and
now
she
reached
the
cabin
in
a
much
more
cheerful
mood
peter
was
nowhere
about
and
as
she
plunged
into
the
work
of
house
and
farmyard
she
supposed
without
giving
the
matter
a
conscious
thought
that
he
had
gone
to
the
city
mis
peter
not
go
train
kow
announced
presently
all
alix
vague
suspicions
awakened
not
go
train
she
asked
with
a
premonitory
pang
kow
made
a
large
gesture
as
indicating
affairs
disorganized
him
no
go
to
bed
he
further
stated
alix
stopped
the
busy
chopping
that
she
was
carrying
on
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
table
and
looked
at
the
chinese
boy
fearfully
peter
not
go
to
bed
she
echoed
with
a
sick
heart
no
sleep
kow
announced
positively
and
pleased
with
her
tense
interest
he
added
boss
come
late
he
walkin
on
porch
he
came
in
late
and
walked
on
the
porch
alix
echoed
in
a
low
tone
as
if
to
herself
and
you
say
he
did
sleep
kow
bed
all
same
daytime
the
boy
said
and
with
the
artless
laugh
of
his
race
he
added
go
sleep
you
slept
of
course
alix
answered
absently
where
peter
go
now
she
asked
he
have
some
coffee
no
eat
the
boy
answered
he
indicated
the
direction
of
the
creek
and
after
a
while
alix
with
an
icy
heart
went
to
the
bridge
and
the
pool
where
peter
had
first
found
cherry
only
a
few
weeks
ago
he
was
standing
staring
vaguely
at
the
low
and
lisping
stream
and
alix
felt
a
great
pang
of
pity
when
she
saw
him
he
came
to
her
smiling
but
as
cherry
had
smiled
with
a
wan
and
ghastly
face
peter
you
not
well
alix
said
i
think
i
am
a
little
upset
he
answered
they
walked
back
to
the
house
together
alix
ordered
him
to
take
a
hot
bath
and
made
him
drink
some
coffee
when
refreshed
and
grateful
he
came
out
to
the
porch
half
an
hour
later
they
shared
the
little
meal
that
was
her
luncheon
and
his
breakfast
and
now
we
got
to
go
down
and
get
the
others
for
they
coming
up
here
for
dinner
alix
said
do
you
do
you
feel
up
to
tennis
she
asked
anxiously
sure
i
do
peter
answered
with
an
effort
do
have
to
you
know
she
assured
him
feeling
a
great
desolation
sweep
her
oh
i
like
it
it
a
wonderful
day
he
answered
politely
he
followed
her
to
the
car
and
got
in
the
front
seat
beside
her
you
awfully
good
to
me
he
said
briefly
when
they
were
going
down
the
long
grade
alix
did
not
answer
immediately
and
he
thought
that
she
had
not
heard
she
ran
the
big
machine
through
the
valley
where
the
dry
glaring
heat
of
the
day
burned
mercilessly
stopped
at
the
and
still
in
silence
began
the
climb
toward
the
old
house
the
roads
were
all
narrow
here
but
she
could
have
followed
them
in
the
dark
he
knew
and
he
understood
that
it
was
not
her
driving
that
made
her
face
so
thoughtful
and
kept
her
eyes
from
meeting
his
on
one
side
of
the
mountain
road
rose
the
sharp
hillside
clothed
in
redwoods
on
the
other
the
ground
fell
away
so
precipitously
to
the
tiny
thread
of
creek
below
that
they
looked
down
upon
the
water
through
the
top
branches
of
the
trees
years
ago
when
he
had
first
entrusted
her
with
the
car
peter
had
been
somewhat
concerned
for
alix
safely
but
now
he
was
secretly
proud
of
her
sureness
of
touch
and
of
the
generosity
and
that
prompted
her
to
give
the
inner
right
of
way
to
every
lumbering
express
van
or
surrey
that
she
met
and
risk
the
more
dangerous
passing
herself
you
say
i
good
to
you
pete
she
surprised
him
by
saying
suddenly
i
hope
i
am
for
you
been
very
good
to
me
my
dear
there
only
one
thing
in
life
now
that
i
have
got
and
want
and
that
you
ca
unfortunately
get
for
me
he
had
flushed
darkly
and
he
spoke
with
a
little
effort
i
like
to
try
she
ignored
the
invitation
for
a
few
minutes
and
for
an
instant
of
panic
he
thought
he
saw
her
lip
tremble
but
when
she
turned
to
him
it
was
with
her
usual
smile
it
only
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
and
and
martin
and
cherry
as
happy
as
i
am
she
said
quickly
and
a
second
later
the
mood
was
gone
as
she
turned
the
car
in
at
the
home
gate
and
exclaimed
cherry
now
there
was
cherry
peter
heart
gave
a
leap
at
the
sight
of
her
just
a
woman
slender
figure
half
obscured
by
blowing
lines
of
fresh
dry
linen
just
white
arms
where
the
snowy
frill
of
her
gown
fell
back
and
blue
eyes
under
bright
loose
hair
but
peter
could
see
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
martin
somewhere
about
cherry
said
as
peter
joined
her
and
alix
stopped
the
car
within
conversational
range
i
was
passing
these
and
i
thought
i
help
the
boy
get
his
clothes
in
here
let
me
do
that
peter
exclaimed
alix
remarking
that
she
would
turn
the
car
so
that
she
might
later
start
on
the
grade
disappeared
and
the
two
were
alone
with
their
arms
full
of
the
stiff
and
fragrant
cleanness
of
the
linen
in
the
sweetness
of
the
afternoon
just
just
fold
them
roughly
stammered
cherry
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
was
saying
and
put
them
in
the
basket
peter
did
not
hear
the
words
but
he
heard
the
wonderful
voice
he
saw
the
red
sweetness
of
the
mouth
saw
the
quick
glances
of
the
averted
eyes
the
white
neck
with
its
film
of
gold
hair
blowing
across
it
he
murmured
something
inarticulate
in
reply
trying
to
control
the
great
wave
of
happiness
and
emotion
that
rose
over
him
they
were
together
again
after
what
a
night
and
what
a
day
and
that
was
all
that
mattered
they
spoke
confusedly
in
brief
monosyllables
and
were
silent
their
hands
touching
on
the
line
their
eyes
meeting
only
furtively
and
briefly

the
suitcase
she
added
with
an
enchanting
flush
you

in
new
orleans
on
tuesday
he
promised
her
made
no
plans
beyond
that
a
hat
cherry
asked
with
uplifted
silky
lashes
giving
a
childish
look
to
her
blue
eyes
peter
tightening
his
fingers
on
hers
gave
a
great
joyous
laugh
of
utter
surprise
and
adoration
as
leaning
toward
her
he
caught
her
bashful
murmur
you
need
that
he
whispered
well
most
she
answered
seriously
do
you
realize
he
asked
that
you
are
the
most
delicious
child
that
ever
lived
no
i
do
know
that
she
said
drooping
her
head
suddenly
do
you
realize
that
by
this
time
tomorrow
we
shall
be
out
at
sea
he
added
leaning
on
the
rail
watching
the
pacific
race
by
and
belonging
to
each
other
forever
and
ever
the
picture
flooded
her
face
with
happy
colour
it
tomorrow
at
last
she
said
wonderingly
as
they
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
i
thought
it
would
never
be
it
only
a
few
hours
more
now
how
will
you
feel
when
it
he
asked
oh
peter
i
shall
be
so
glad
when
it
all
over
and
when
the
letters
are
written
and
when
we
been
together
for
a
year
she
answered
fervently
i
know
it
will
be
all
as
we
have
planned
but
but
if
it
were
over
they
had
reached
the
side
door
now
and
were
mounting
the
three
steps
together
be
patient
until
tomorrow
he
whispered
oh
she
said
softly
i
sha
breathe
until
tomorrow
leaning
across
her
to
push
back
the
light
screen
door
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
alix
in
the
dark
entryway
peter
and
cherry
had
not
seen
her
had
not
heard
her
move
peter
cursed
his
carelessness
he
could
not
remember
in
the
utter
confusion
of
the
moment
just
what
he
and
cherry
had
said
but
if
it
was
of
a
betraying
nature
they
had
betrayed
themselves
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
she
had
not
heard
yet
if
she
was
acting
she
was
acting
superbly
cherry
had
turned
scarlet
and
had
given
him
an
open
glance
of
consternation
but
alix
did
not
seem
to
see
it
she
addressed
peter
but
when
he
found
himself
physically
unable
to
answer
she
continued
the
conversation
with
no
apparent
consciousness
of
his
stumbling
effort
to
appear
natural
there
you
are
are
we
going
to
have
any
tennis
it
after
two
now
two
seventeen
martin
said
following
her
out
of
the
house
and
slipping
his
big
watch
back
into
his
pocket
they
all
gathered
in
one
of
the
reclaimed
garden
paths
assuming
a
deep
interest
in
the
time
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
peter
said
i
knew
it
was
getting
on
cherry
added
utterly
at
random
go
in
and
tell
the
boy
we
wo
be
back
until
tomorrow
martin
suggested
to
his
wife
unless
you
told
him
alix
he
added
turning
toward
her
i
beg
your
pardon
her
face
was
very
pale
and
she
started
as
if
from
deep
thought
as
she
spoke
you
could
all
come
down
here
to
sleep
cherry
said
and
have
breakfast
here
i
have
to
go
into
town
rather
early
tomorrow
peter
remarked
porter
giving
a
breakfast
at
the
bohemian
club
why
not
walk
up
to
the
cabin
cherry
suggested
in
a
shaking
voice
i
have
to
take
the
car
up
you
three
walk
come
on
anybody
who
wants
to
ride
alix
said
they
can
walk
martin
said
getting
into
the
front
seat
me
for
the
little
old
bus
cherry
came
out
of
the
house
with
her
hat
on
and
buck
leaped
before
her
into
the
back
seat
alix
watched
her
as
she
stepped
up
on
the
running
board
and
saw
the
colour
flicker
in
her
beautiful
face
i
thought
you
were
going
to
walk
peter
said
nervously
he
had
sauntered
up
to
them
with
an
air
of
indifference
shall
i
faltered
cherry
she
looked
at
alix
who
had
not
yet
climbed
into
the
car
and
was
pulling
on
her
driving
gloves
alix
toward
whose
face
the
dog
was
making
eager
springs
did
not
appear
interested
so
cherry
turned
to
martin
walk
with
us
mart
she
said
nix
martin
said
comfortably
not
stirring
i
be
home
before
you
pete
and
wait
for
you
alix
said
she
looked
at
him
irresolutely
as
if
she
would
have
added
more
but
evidently
decided
against
it
and
spoke
again
only
in
reference
to
the
dog
keep
buck
with
you
will
you
pete
she
said
he
getting
too
lazy
no
sir
she
reproached
the
animal
affectionately
you
shall
not
ride
well
the
dear
old
does
he
want
to
come
along
and
she
knelt
down
and
put
her
arms
about
the
animal
and
laid
her
brown
cheek
against
his
head
you
old
fool
she
said
shaking
him
gently
to
and
fro
you
got
to
stay
with
peter
old
buck
suddenly
she
was
on
her
feet
and
had
sprung
into
her
place
hold
him
pete
she
said
goodbye
sis
dear
all
right
martin
the
engine
raced
the
car
slipped
smoothly
into
gear
and
vanished
peter
and
cherry
stood
looking
at
each
other
give
them
a
good
start
or
buck
will
catch
them
peter
said
his
body
swaying
with
the
frantic
jumping
of
the
straining
dog
but
to
himself
he
said
with
a
sense
of
shock
alix
knows
buck
was
off
like
a
rocket
when
he
finally
set
him
free
his
feathery
tail
disappeared
between
the
columns
of
the
redwoods
without
speaking
cherry
and
peter
started
after
him
and
now
that
we
are
alone
together
cherry
said
after
a
few
minutes
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
say
we
said
it
all
nothing
to
say
peter
echoed
alix
knows
he
said
in
his
heart
whatever
we
do
it
all
seems
so
wrong
cherry
said
with
watering
eyes
whatever
we
do
is
wrong
he
agreed
soberly
but
we
go
she
said
on
a
fluttering
breath
we
must
go
peter
answered
and
again
like
the
ominous
fall
of
a
heavy
the
words
formed
in
his
heart
alix
knows
alix
knows
he
thought
of
the
afternoon
only
a
few
weeks
ago
when
cherry
beauty
had
made
so
sudden
and
so
irresistible
an
appeal
to
him
and
of
the
innocent
delight
of
their
luncheons
together
when
she
had
first
confided
in
him
and
of
the
days
of
secret
and
intense
joy
that
her
mere
nearness
and
the
knowledge
that
he
would
see
her
had
afforded
him
it
had
all
seemed
so
fresh
so
natural
so
entirely
their
own
affair
until
the
tragic
day
of
martin
reappearance
and
the
hour
of
agonized
waiting
at
the
boat
for
the
cherry
who
did
not
come
there
had
been
no
joyous
in
that
hour
none
in
the
distressed
hour
at
the
orpheum
and
the
hour
just
past
when
cherry
rarely
displayed
passion
had
wrenched
from
him
his
last
vestige
of
doubt
but
this
was
the
culminating
unhappiness
that
he
should
know
from
alix
brave
and
gentle
and
generous
look
as
they
parted
that
alix
knew
he
had
in
the
wild
rush
and
hurry
of
his
thoughts
no
time
now
to
analyze
what
their
love
must
mean
to
her
but
it
hurt
him
to
see
on
her
happy
face
those
lines
of
sternness
and
gravity
to
see
her
bright
and
honest
eyes
shadowed
with
that
new
look
of
pain
it
was
too
late
now
to
undo
it
he
and
cherry
must
carry
their
desperate
plan
to
a
conclusion
now
must
disappear
and
forget
they
had
tried
all
this
last
dreadful
week
they
had
both
tried
to
extinguish
the
flames
and
they
had
failed
but
to
peter
there
was
no
comforting
thought
anywhere
wrong
would
be
done
to
martin
to
alix
to
cherry
and
more
than
even
these
wrong
to
himself
to
the
ideal
of
himself
that
had
been
his
for
so
many
years
to
the
real
peter
joyce
if
i
had
it
all
to
do
over
again
i
should
not
come
here
cherry
began
breathlessly
ah
if
we
had
it
all
to
do
over
again
looking
back
half
a
dozen
years
how
simple
it
all
seemed
how
uncomplicated
life
was
in
those
old
days
when
the
doctor
and
his
girls
had
teased
him
and
consulted
him
and
made
him
one
of
themselves
what
a
web
cherry
he
said
sadly
if
anne
had
made
her
claim
you
would
not
have
been
kept
here
all
these
weeks
if
the
financial
question
had
been
raised
you
must
have
stayed
in
red
creek
simply
because
you
could
well
have
done
anything
else
and
if
i
had
been
with
martin
this
horrible
business
of
that
letter
would
have
happened
she
added
bravely
oh
yes
quite
true
she
interrupted
him
as
he
interpolated
a
bitter
protest
mart
has
no
particular
principle
about
it
but
he
never
would
have
got
in
with
that
crowd
if
i
had
been
there
so
that
once
more
she
ended
sadly
i
can
say
that
i
have
made
a
mess
of
things
listen
buck
she
interrupted
herself
as
the
dog
loud
and
violent
barking
reached
them
from
beyond
a
turn
in
the
twisting
road
he
did
catch
them
then
the
next
instant
a
woman
came
up
the
road
running
and
making
a
queer
whimpering
noise
that
cherry
never
forgot
she
was
a
stranger
to
them
but
she
ran
toward
them
making
the
odd
gasping
noise
with
much
dry
mouthing
and
with
wild
eyes
horror
was
in
her
aspect
and
horror
was
the
emotion
that
the
first
glimpse
of
her
awakened
vaguely
in
their
hearts
but
as
she
saw
them
she
suddenly
found
voice
for
so
hideous
a
scream
that
cherry
knees
failed
her
and
peter
sprang
forward
with
a
shout
he
gripped
the
woman
arm
and
her
frantic
eyes
were
turned
to
him
oh
my
god
she
cried
in
a
hoarse
cawing
voice
my
god
over
the
bank
they
over
the
bank
who
peter
shouted
his
heart
turning
to
ashes
oh
the
car
the
automobile
the
woman
mouthed
oh
my
god
i
saw
it
go
i
saw
it
fall
oh
god
save
god
take
them
do
let
them
suffer
that
way
they
were
all
running
now
running
with
desperate
speed
down
the
long
road
about
the
curves
on
and
on
toward
the
frantic
noise
of
the
barking
and
toward
another
noise
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
twisted
and
wild
with
agony
the
strange
woman
was
crying
out
wildly
cherry
was
sobbing
a
prayer
peter
without
knowing
that
he
spoke
at
all
was
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
words
not
god
it
can
not
be
she
has
never
had
an
accident
alix
a
last
curve
and
they
knew
over
one
of
the
sharpest
and
ugliest
of
the
descending
precipices
crashing
down
through
the
saplings
and
underbrush
and
striking
the
trunks
of
a
score
of
trees
on
its
way
the
heavy
car
had
fallen
like
a
boulder
and
peter
saw
that
it
was
car
and
with
a
great
cry
he
sprang
over
the
bank
and
slipping
and
stumbling
followed
its
mad
course
down
almost
to
the
dry
in
the
canyon
and
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
huddled
figure
that
erect
and
strong
in
its
striped
blue
gingham
had
been
alix
only
a
few
short
minutes
ago
she
had
been
flung
clear
of
the
car
and
although
almost
every
bone
in
her
body
was
broken
by
some
miracle
the
face
except
for
a
deep
cut
where
the
brown
hair
met
the
tanned
forehead
was
untouched
and
as
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
bent
over
her
with
the
bitterness
of
death
stopping
his
own
heart
a
soft
thick
braid
loosened
and
fell
like
the
touch
of
her
hand
upon
his
own
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
tranquil
face
and
in
the
very
look
of
the
closed
and
eyelids
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
alix
old
smile
peter
forgot
everything
else
in
the
world
he
held
her
close
to
him
and
put
his
face
against
her
face
and
perhaps
she
had
never
so
truly
been
his
own
as
in
this
moment
of
their
parting
when
the
quiet
autumn
woodland
shot
with
long
shafts
from
the
sinking
sun
rang
with
his
bitter
cry
no
alix
not
dead
my
wife
my
wife
there
were
other
men
and
women
gathering
fast
now
and
the
whole
little
valley
was
beginning
to
ring
with
the
tragedy
after
a
while
some
sympathetic
man
touched
peter
on
the
arm
to
say
that
lloyd
had
fainted
and
that
if
he
would
please
tell
them
what
to
do
about
the
other
man
he
was
not
yet
dead
peter
roused
himself
and
with
help
from
half
a
dozen
hands
on
all
sides
he
carried
alix
up
to
the
road
and
laid
her
upon
a
motor
robe
that
some
kindly
spectator
had
spread
in
the
deep
dust
ah
about
he
heard
the
quick
horrified
breathing
and
muttering
of
the
shocked
and
sympathetic
neighbours
who
had
gathered
but
to
him
there
was
a
brassy
light
in
the
world
and
a
hideous
taste
of
inky
bitterness
in
the
very
air
he
breathed
and
he
recognized
nobody
presently
he
was
conscious
that
a
small
slight
woman
with
disorderly
fair
hair
and
with
her
face
streaked
with
dust
and
tears
was
standing
beside
him
and
looking
down
at
her
he
saw
that
it
was
cherry
yes
cherry
he
said
moistening
his
dry
lips
peter
she
said
they
say
martin
living
he
was
screaming
she
grew
deathly
pale
and
faintness
swept
over
her
but
she
mastered
it
he
was
caught
by
that
tree
she
said
and
he
is
living
will
you
tell
them
tell
one
of
these
men
that
if
he
will
help
me
we
can
drive
him
home
if
you
tell
him
that
then
i
get
a
doctor
yes
i
will
peter
said
not
stirring
his
eyes
had
the
look
of
a
he
nodded
slowly
and
gravely
at
her
like
a
very
old
man
you
he
said
to
a
man
who
had
stopped
his
car
near
by
and
who
was
pressing
sympathetically
close
will
you
if
you
sit
in
the
back
seat
dear
and
just
rest
his
poor
head
a
woman
said
to
cherry
peter
saw
that
they
were
lifting
martin
big
senseless
form
in
tender
hands
and
carrying
it
through
the
little
group
there
was
a
shudder
as
martin
moaned
deeply
peter
went
and
sat
on
the
low
bank
by
alix
again
and
lifted
one
of
her
limp
hands
and
held
it
ah
if
in
god
mercy
and
goodness
she
might
moan
he
thought
that
one
slight
ray
of
hope
would
flood
all
the
world
with
light
for
him
again
but
she
did
not
stir
gone
said
cherry
heartrending
voice
a
mere
whisper
beside
him
he
turned
upon
her
lifeless
eyes
gone
he
echoed
oh
alix
my
darling
my
own
big
sister
cherry
sobbed
falling
to
her
knees
and
passionately
kissing
the
peaceful
face
oh
alix
dearest
the
women
about
broke
into
tears
peter
pressed
his
hand
close
against
his
aching
eyeballs
wishing
that
he
might
cry
she
drove
here
he
heard
a
man
voice
saying
in
the
silence
and
she
must
have
lost
control
of
her
car
for
a
minute
then
do
you
see
the
wheel
slipped
on
the
bank
once
it
got
this
far
no
power
in
god
earth
no
power
in
god
earth
another
man
voice
said
in
solemn
confirmation
peter
cherry
said
will
you
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
i
shall
need
you
as
soon
as
i
can
he
answered
absently
the
car
drove
away
and
he
heard
martin
moan
again
as
it
moved
joyce
said
a
man
kind
voice
close
beside
him
he
recognized
the
voice
rather
than
the
distressed
face
of
an
old
friend
and
neighbour
joyce
my
dear
fellow
he
urged
affectionately
tell
us
what
we
may
do
and
we
see
to
it
pull
yourself
together
my
dear
old
chap
now
shall
i
telephone
for
an
an
ambulance
you
must
help
us
just
a
little
here
and
then
we
spare
you
everything
else
thank
you
fred
peter
answered
after
a
moment
during
which
he
looked
seriously
and
studiously
at
his
friend
as
if
ascertaining
through
unseen
mists
and
barriers
the
identity
of
the
speaker
thank
you
he
said
will
you
help
me
take
my
wife
home
you
wish
it
that
way
the
other
man
said
anxiously
please
peter
answered
simply
and
instantly
there
was
moving
and
clearing
in
the
crowd
a
murmuring
of
whispered
directions
after
a
while
they
were
at
the
mountain
cabin
and
kow
with
tears
running
down
his
yellow
face
was
helping
them
then
peter
and
his
friend
were
walking
up
over
the
familiar
trails
he
hardly
knew
where
in
the
late
twilight
and
then
they
went
into
the
old
living
room
and
alix
was
lying
there
splendid
sweet
untouched
with
her
brave
brown
forehead
shadowed
softly
by
her
brown
hair
and
her
lashes
resting
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
fingers
clasped
about
the
stems
of
three
great
creamy
roses
there
were
other
flowers
all
about
and
there
were
women
in
the
room
white
draperies
fell
with
sweeping
lines
from
the
merciful
veiling
of
the
crushed
figure
and
alix
might
have
been
only
asleep
and
dreaming
some
heroic
dream
that
lent
that
secret
pride
and
joy
to
her
mouth
and
filled
those
closed
eyes
with
a
triumph
they
had
never
known
in
life
peter
stood
and
looked
down
at
her
and
the
men
and
women
drew
back
but
although
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
twitched
he
did
not
weep
he
looked
long
at
her
while
an
utter
silence
filled
the
room
and
while
twilight
deepened
into
dark
over
the
cabin
and
over
the
mountain
above
it
something
cold
touched
his
hand
and
he
heard
the
dog
whimper
without
turning
his
head
or
moving
his
eyes
from
alix
face
he
pressed
his
fingers
on
the
silky
head
his
breast
rose
on
one
agonized
breath
but
he
controlled
it
buck
was
as
still
as
his
master
sensing
in
unfailing
that
something
was
wrong
so
that
was
your
way
out
alix
peter
said
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
that
was
your
solution
for
us
all
you
would
go
out
of
life
away
from
the
sunshine
and
the
trees
and
the
hills
that
you
loved
so
that
cherry
and
i
should
be
saved
i
was
blind
not
to
see
it
i
have
been
blind
from
the
very
beginning
silence
the
room
was
filling
with
shadows
on
the
mantel
was
a
deep
bowl
of
roses
that
he
remembered
watching
her
cut
was
it
yesterday
or
centuries
ago
i
was
wrong
he
said
but
i
think
you
would
be
sorry
to
have
me
face
what
i
am
facing
now
you
were
always
so
forgiving
alix
you
would
be
the
first
to
be
sorry
he
put
his
hand
over
the
tigerish
pain
that
was
beginning
to
reach
his
heart
his
throat
felt
thick
and
choked
and
still
he
did
not
cry
an
hour
ago
he
said
if
it
had
been
that
the
least
thought
of
what
this
meant
to
you
might
have
reached
me
an
hour
ago
it
would
not
have
been
too
late
alix
one
look
into
your
eyes
an
hour
ago
might
have
saved
us
all
fred
peter
said
aloud
with
a
bitter
groan
clinching
tight
the
hands
of
the
old
friend
who
had
crept
in
to
stand
beside
him
fred
she
was
here
in
all
her
health
and
joy
and
strength
only
today
and
now
i
know
old
man
the
other
man
muttered
he
looked
anxiously
at
peter
terrible
face
in
the
silence
the
dog
whimpered
faintly
but
when
peter
after
an
endless
five
minutes
turned
away
it
was
to
speak
to
his
friend
in
an
almost
normal
voice
i
must
go
down
and
see
cherry
fred
she
took
her
husband
to
the
old
house
they
were
living
there
helen
will
stay
here
the
man
assured
him
quickly
i
drive
you
down
and
come
back
here
we
thought
perhaps
a
few
of
us
could
come
here
afternoon
peter
he
added
timidly
with
his
reddened
eyes
filling
again
and
talk
of
her
a
little
and
pray
for
her
a
little
and
then
take
her
to
to
rest
beside
the
old
doctor
i
had
thought
about
that
peter
answered
still
with
the
air
of
finding
it
hard
to
link
words
to
thought
but
that
is
the
way
she
would
like
it
thank
you
and
thank
helen
for
me
oh
peter
to
do
anything
the
woman
faltered
she
came
to
us
you
know
when
the
baby
was
so
ill
day
after
day
my
own
sister
have
been
more
to
us
did
she
peter
asked
staring
at
the
speaker
steadily
that
was
like
her
he
went
out
of
the
house
and
got
into
a
waiting
car
and
they
drove
down
the
mountain
alix
had
driven
him
over
this
road
day
before
yesterday
yesterday
no
it
was
today
he
remembered
thank
god
i
do
feel
it
yet
as
i
shall
feel
it
thompson
he
said
quietly
the
man
who
was
driving
gave
him
an
anxious
glance
you
must
take
each
day
as
it
comes
he
answered
simply
peter
nodded
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
stared
into
the
early
dark
there
was
no
other
way
to
go
than
past
the
very
spot
where
the
horror
had
occurred
but
thompson
told
his
wife
later
that
poor
joyce
had
not
seemed
to
know
it
when
they
passed
it
nor
did
he
give
any
evidence
of
emotion
when
they
reached
the
old
strickland
house
and
entered
the
old
hallway
where
cherry
had
come
flying
in
a
few
short
years
ago
with
martin
first
kiss
upon
her
lips
two
doctors
summoned
from
san
francisco
were
here
and
two
nurses
martin
had
been
laid
upon
a
hastily
moved
bed
in
the
old
study
to
be
spared
the
narrow
stairs
the
room
was
metamorphosed
the
whole
house
moved
about
it
as
about
a
pivot
and
there
was
no
thought
but
for
the
man
who
lay
sometimes
moaning
and
sometimes
ominously
still
waiting
for
death
he
can
not
live
whispered
cherry
ghastly
of
face
and
with
the
utter
chaos
of
her
soul
and
brain
expressed
by
her
tumbled
frock
and
the
carelessly
pushed
back
and
knotted
masses
of
her
hair
his
arm
is
broken
peter
and
his
leg
crushed
they
do
dare
touch
him
and
the
surgeon
says
the
spine
too
and
you
see
his
head
oh
god
it
is
so
terrible
she
said
in
agony
through
shut
teeth
knotting
her
hands
together
it
is
too
terrible
that
he
is
breathing
now
that
life
is
there
now
and
that
they
can
not
hold
it
she
led
peter
into
the
sitting
room
where
the
doctors
were
waiting
the
nurses
came
and
went
the
lamps
had
been
lighted
both
the
physicians
rose
as
peter
came
in
and
he
knew
that
they
had
been
told
that
this
was
the
man
whose
wife
had
been
killed
that
day
their
manner
expressed
the
sympathy
they
did
not
voice
peter
sat
down
with
them
is
there
any
hope
he
asked
when
cherry
had
gone
away
on
one
of
the
restless
unnecessary
journeys
with
which
she
was
filling
the
endless
hours
one
man
shook
his
head
and
in
the
silence
they
heard
martin
groan
it
is
possible
he
may
weather
it
of
course
the
older
man
said
doubtfully
he
is
coming
out
of
that
first
stupor
and
we
may
be
able
to
tell
better
in
a
short
time
the
fact
that
he
is
living
at
all
indicates
a
tremendous
vitality
thoughtfully
and
gravely
they
exchanged
technical
phrases
chinese
boy
brought
in
a
tray
and
both
the
other
men
ate
and
drank
peter
nodded
a
negative
without
a
change
of
expression
but
presently
he
roused
himself
to
replenish
the
fire
the
clock
ticked
and
ticked
in
the
stillness
cherry
came
to
the
door
to
say
doctor
on
a
burst
of
tears
the
physicians
departed
at
once
to
the
study
and
peter
was
immediately
summoned
to
assist
them
in
handling
the
big
frame
of
the
patient
martin
was
thoroughly
conscious
now
his
face
chalk
white
cherry
agonized
knelt
beside
the
bed
her
frightened
eyes
moving
from
face
to
face
there
was
a
brief
consultation
then
cherry
and
peter
were
banished
do
worry
dear
said
one
of
the
nurses
coming
out
of
the
it
just
that
doctor
henry
thinks
he
would
be
more
comfortable
if
we
could
get
the
arm
and
leg
set
you
see
now
that
conscious
and
is
running
just
a
little
temperature
much
fever
cherry
asked
sharply
oh
nothing
at
all
dear
the
nurse
hastened
to
say
the
only
thing
is
that
setting
the
arm
and
leg
will
ease
the
pain
and
save
his
strength
she
bustled
off
for
basins
bandages
and
hot
water
in
the
silence
martin
groans
occasionally
broke
cherry
her
eyes
on
the
study
door
stood
biting
her
fingers
in
frenzy
when
from
the
sound
of
martin
voice
she
realized
that
he
was
being
hurt
she
looked
at
peter
in
agony
oh
why
do
they
do
that
why
do
they
do
that
torturing
him
for
nothing
he
heard
her
whisper
go
in
and
go
in
and
do
something
she
urged
incoherently
but
the
sounds
had
stopped
and
there
was
a
blessed
interval
of
silence
the
clock
on
the
mantel
sounded
eight
in
swift
silvery
strokes
and
presently
a
sympathetic
nurse
came
silently
in
with
a
tray
holding
two
cups
of
hot
soup
cherry
shut
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
please
cherry
you
need
it
peter
pleaded
carrying
her
a
smoking
cup
she
protested
again
with
a
gesture
looked
wearily
into
his
eyes
and
drank
the
soup
docilely
like
a
child
you
too
peter
she
said
suddenly
rousing
herself
peter
gulped
down
his
own
cupful
waved
away
the
sandwiches
that
were
on
the
tray
and
took
the
chair
opposite
the
one
in
which
cherry
was
sitting
the
clock
presently
struck
the
but
neither
spoke
pallor
her
air
of
fatigue
and
bewilderment
and
the
familiar
setting
of
the
old
environment
made
her
seem
a
child
again
peter
watched
her
with
a
confused
sense
that
the
whole
frightful
day
had
been
a
dream
once
she
looked
up
and
met
his
eyes
he
ca
live
she
said
in
a
whisper
perhaps
not
peter
answered
very
low
cherry
returned
to
her
sombre
musing
we
did
see
this
end
to
it
did
we
she
said
with
a
pitiful
smile
after
a
long
while
oh
no
no
peter
said
shutting
his
eyes
and
with
a
faint
negative
movement
of
his
head
we
would
have
had
this
happen
cherry
began
her
lips
trembled
her
whole
face
wrinkled
and
she
put
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
pressed
it
there
with
a
gesture
of
forlornness
and
sorrow
that
wrenched
peter
heart
her
tears
began
to
fall
fast
poor
cherry
if
i
could
spare
you
all
this
he
said
knotting
his
fingers
and
feeling
for
the
first
time
the
prick
of
bitter
tears
against
his
eyelids
oh
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
she
said
faintly
and
wearily
after
a
while
and
she
whispered
as
if
to
herself
nothing
nothing
nothing
then
there
was
silence
again
the
lamps
burned
softly
the
fire
sucked
and
flickered
a
chilling
air
full
of
autumn
sadness
began
to
creep
from
the
corners
of
the
room
peter
eyes
moved
over
the
backs
of
the
old
books
dickens
and
thackeray
and
the
household
book
of
verse
moved
to
the
faded
photograph
of
cherry
mother
on
the
mantel
a
beautiful
woman
in
the
big
sleeves
of
the
late
nineties
the
doctors
came
back
there
was
a
little
stir
and
rearrangement
as
they
seated
themselves
any
change
cherry
asked
cautiously
no
change
both
men
shook
their
heads
any
any
hope
she
faltered
the
physicians
exchanged
glances
no
word
was
spoken
but
the
look
in
their
faces
the
faint
narrowing
of
eyes
and
compressing
of
lips
gave
her
her
answer
chapter
xxiii
it
was
all
strange
and
bewildering
thought
peter
it
was
not
like
anything
he
had
ever
connected
in
his
thoughts
with
alix
yet
it
was
all
for
her
the
day
was
warm
and
still
and
the
little
church
was
packed
with
flowers
and
packed
with
people
women
were
crying
and
men
were
crying
too
rather
to
his
dazed
surprise
the
organ
was
straining
through
the
warm
fragrant
air
and
the
old
clergyman
whose
venerable
leonine
head
in
its
crown
of
snowy
hair
peter
could
see
clearly
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
thickened
with
tears
strangers
or
almost
strangers
had
been
touching
peter
hand
respectfully
timidly
had
been
praising
alix
she
had
been
good
to
this
one
good
to
that
one
they
told
him
she
had
always
been
so
interested
and
so
happy
her
coffin
was
buried
in
flowers
many
of
them
the
plain
flowers
she
loved
the
gillies
and
stock
and
verbena
and
even
the
sweet
sober
that
were
somehow
like
herself
but
it
was
the
roses
that
scented
the
whole
world
for
alix
and
fresh
creamy
buds
had
been
placed
between
the
waxen
fingers
and
still
that
radiant
look
of
triumphant
love
lingered
on
her
quiet
face
and
still
the
faint
ghost
of
a
smile
touched
the
once
kindly
and
merry
mouth
they
said
to
her
at
the
church
the
villagers
and
old
friends
who
had
loved
her
and
peter
and
two
or
three
men
alone
followed
her
down
along
the
winding
road
that
led
to
the
old
cemetery
cherry
was
hanging
over
the
bedside
of
her
husband
who
still
miraculously
lingered
through
hours
of
pain
but
as
peter
responsive
to
a
touch
on
his
arm
crossed
the
church
porch
to
blindly
enter
the
waiting
he
saw
erect
and
grave
on
the
front
seat
in
his
decent
holiday
black
and
with
his
felt
hat
held
in
his
hands
kow
claiming
his
right
to
stand
beside
the
grave
of
the
mistress
he
had
loved
and
served
so
faithfully
the
sight
of
him
in
his
clumsy
black
instead
of
the
usual
crisp
white
and
with
a
sad
and
face
shook
peter
strangely
but
he
did
not
show
a
sign
of
pain
the
twisted
low
branches
of
oak
trees
threw
shadows
on
the
grave
when
they
finally
reached
it
and
sheep
were
cropping
the
watered
grass
of
the
graveyard
it
was
silent
and
peaceful
here
on
the
very
top
of
the
world
not
a
sound
intruded
and
nothing
stirred
but
the
shadow
of
a
flying
bird
and
the
slowly
moving
rounded
woolly
backs
of
the
sheep
the
soft
autumn
sky
the
drift
of
snowy
clouds
across
the
blue
the
clear
shadows
on
brown
grass
under
the
oaks
all
these
were
familiar
but
peter
still
looked
dazedly
at
his
black
cuff
and
at
the
turned
earth
next
to
the
doctor
headstone
telling
himself
again
that
this
was
for
alix
how
often
he
had
seen
her
sitting
there
with
her
bright
face
sobered
and
sweet
as
she
talked
lovingly
eagerly
of
her
father
they
had
often
come
here
peter
the
more
willingly
because
she
was
so
sensible
and
happy
about
it
she
would
pack
lunch
button
herself
into
one
of
the
crisp
blue
ginghams
chatter
on
the
road
in
her
usual
fashion
and
if
for
a
few
moments
the
train
of
memory
fired
by
the
sight
of
the
old
doctor
grave
became
too
poignant
and
tears
came
she
always
scolded
herself
with
that
mixture
of
childish
and
maternal
impatience
that
was
so
characteristic
of
her
and
that
peter
had
seen
her
use
to
this
very
father
years
ago
he
remembered
her
a
tall
awkward
girl
with
a
volume
of
dickens
slipping
from
her
lap
as
she
sat
on
a
hassock
by
the
fire
teasing
her
father
scolding
and
reproaching
him
blazing
red
on
high
untidy
black
hair
quick
tongue
and
ready
laugh
that
was
the
alix
of
the
old
days
when
he
had
criticized
and
patronized
her
and
told
her
that
she
should
be
more
like
anne
and
little
cherry
he
remembered
being
delegated
one
day
to
take
her
into
town
to
the
dentist
and
that
upon
discovering
that
the
dentist
was
not
in
his
office
he
had
taken
her
to
the
circus
instead
she
had
been
about
thirteen
and
had
eaten
too
many
peanuts
he
thought
and
had
lost
a
petticoat
in
full
sight
of
the
but
how
grateful
and
happy
she
had
been
dear
little
old
blue
petticoat
he
said
dear
little
old
madcap
alix
there
was
silence
the
silence
of
inanition
about
him
he
came
to
himself
with
a
start
he
was
up
on
the
hills
in
the
cemetery
this
was
alix
grave
newly
covered
with
wilting
masses
of
flowers
and
he
was
keeping
everybody
waiting
he
murmured
an
apology
the
waiting
men
were
all
kindness
and
sympathy
he
got
back
into
the
kow
got
in
the
man
who
drove
them
quickly
toward
the
valley
talked
easily
and
steadily
to
peter
attempting
to
interest
him
in
the
affairs
of
some
water
company
in
san
francisco
when
they
got
to
the
valley
a
city
train
was
arriving
and
peter
saw
people
looking
at
him
furtively
and
sorrowfully
he
remembered
the
many
many
times
alix
had
waited
for
him
at
the
trains
he
glanced
toward
the
big
madrone
under
which
she
always
parked
her
car
she
was
usually
deep
in
a
book
as
he
crossed
from
the
train
but
she
would
fling
it
into
the
back
seat
and
make
room
for
him
beside
her
the
dog
would
bound
into
the
tonneau
alix
would
hand
her
husband
his
mail
the
car
would
start
with
a
great
plunge
toward
the
mountain
toward
the
cool
garden
high
up
on
the
ridge
she
never
had
an
accident
fred
he
said
simply
alix
the
other
man
nodded
gravely
but
there
was
a
worried
look
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
like
peter
quiet
tone
it
may
be
that
her
broke
he
said
i
do
believe
it
was
her
fault
never
will
no
it
was
just
one
of
those
things
he
emptied
his
lungs
with
a
great
breath
of
nervousness
and
sympathy
now
we
want
you
he
began
pleadingly
no
no
no
peter
said
quickly
i
had
better
go
to
her
sister
poor
lloyd
is
dying
and
she
is
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
the
nurse
said
this
morning
that
they
could
not
get
her
to
undress
or
to
leave
the
room
poor
girl
poor
cherry
i
had
better
go
there
fred
she
will
need
me
no
chance
for
him
the
driving
man
asked
turning
his
car
no
it
only
a
matter
of
time
she
came
in
for
the
old
doctor
money
did
she
yes
all
of
it
now
and
my
wife
had
some
property
some
i
had
given
her
that
will
go
to
the
sister
now
she
will
be
well
fixed
peter
said
in
a
dull
tone
that
would
have
pleased
alix
she
a
beautiful
woman
and
young
still
said
the
other
man
after
awhile
peter
did
not
hear
him
cherry
looked
small
and
pathetic
in
her
fresh
black
and
her
face
was
marked
by
secret
incessant
weeping
but
the
nurses
and
doctors
could
not
say
enough
for
her
she
was
always
composed
always
quietly
helpful
and
calm
when
they
saw
her
and
she
was
always
busy
from
early
morning
when
she
slipped
into
the
to
stand
looking
at
the
unconscious
martin
with
a
troubled
intent
expression
that
the
nurses
came
to
know
well
until
night
she
moved
untiringly
about
the
quiet
shaded
house
she
supervised
the
chinese
boy
saw
that
the
nurses
had
their
hours
for
rest
and
exercise
telephoned
dusted
and
arranged
the
rooms
saw
callers
sweetly
and
patiently
filled
vases
with
flowers
every
day
she
had
several
vigils
in
the
and
every
day
at
least
one
long
talk
with
the
doctors
peter
would
find
her
deep
in
letters
and
documents
or
find
her
who
had
loved
to
be
idle
a
few
weeks
ago
busily
sewing
sometimes
she
gave
him
a
long
list
of
things
to
do
for
her
in
the
village
and
the
city
and
every
day
she
wrote
notes
cherry
who
had
always
hated
to
write
notes
to
thank
the
friends
who
had
sent
in
flowers
soups
and
jellies
and
custards
for
the
patient
every
afternoon
and
evening
had
its
callers
she
and
peter
were
rarely
alone
martin
was
utterly
unconscious
of
the
life
that
flowed
on
about
him
sometimes
he
seemed
to
recognize
cherry
and
would
stare
with
painful
intentness
into
her
face
but
after
a
few
seconds
his
gaze
would
wander
to
the
strange
nurses
and
the
room
that
he
had
never
known
and
with
a
puzzled
sigh
he
would
close
his
eyes
again
and
drift
back
into
his
own
strange
world
of
pain
fever
and
unconsciousness
almost
every
day
there
was
the
sudden
summons
and
panic
in
the
old
house
peter
going
toward
the
with
a
thick
beating
at
his
heart
cherry
entering
and
with
terrified
eyes
doctors
and
nurses
gathering
noiselessly
near
for
the
last
scene
in
the
drama
of
martin
suffering
but
the
release
did
not
come
there
would
be
murmuring
among
the
doctors
and
nurses
the
pulse
was
gaining
not
losing
the
apparently
fatal
final
symptoms
were
proving
neither
fatal
nor
final
the
tension
would
relax
a
doctor
would
go
a
nurse
slip
from
the
room
cherry
looking
anxiously
from
one
face
to
another
would
breathe
more
easily
it
was
inevitable
she
knew
that
now
but
it
was
not
to
be
this
minute
it
was
not
to
be
this
hour
my
dear
my
dear
peter
said
to
her
one
day
when
spent
and
shaken
she
came
stumbling
from
martin
bedside
and
stood
dazedly
looking
from
the
window
into
the
soaking
october
forest
like
a
person
stunned
from
a
blow
my
poor
little
cherry
if
i
could
spare
you
this
nobody
can
spare
me
now
she
whispered
and
very
simply
and
quietly
she
added
if
i
have
been
a
fool
if
i
have
been
a
selfish
wicked
girl
all
my
life
i
am
punished
she
was
clinging
to
the
unpainted
wood
that
framed
the
window
her
hand
above
her
head
and
her
face
resting
against
her
arm
i
am
punished
she
added
cherry
he
protested
heartsick
to
see
her
so
was
it
wrong
for
us
to
love
each
other
peter
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
suppose
it
was
i
suppose
it
was
but
it
never
seemed
as
if
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shivered
as
if
this
would
come
of
it
she
whispered
this
he
echoed
aghast
oh
i
think
this
is
punishment
cherry
continued
in
the
same
lifeless
weary
tone
there
was
a
silence
the
rain
dripped
and
dripped
from
the
redwoods
the
room
in
which
they
stood
was
in
twilight
even
at
noon
peter
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
about
two
weeks
after
the
accident
there
was
a
change
in
the
tone
of
the
physicians
who
had
been
giving
almost
all
their
time
to
case
there
was
no
visible
change
in
martin
but
that
fact
in
itself
was
so
surprising
that
it
was
construed
into
a
definite
hope
that
he
would
live
not
as
he
had
lived
they
warned
his
wife
it
would
be
but
a
restricted
life
tied
to
his
couch
or
permitted
at
best
to
move
about
within
a
small
boundary
on
crutches
martin
his
wife
exclaimed
piteously
when
this
was
first
discussed
he
has
always
been
so
strong
so
independent
he
would
rather
he
would
infinitely
rather
be
dead
but
her
mind
was
busy
grasping
the
possibilities
too
he
wo
suffer
too
much
she
asked
fearfully
they
hastened
to
assure
her
that
the
chance
of
his
even
partial
recovery
was
still
slight
but
that
in
case
of
his
convalescence
martin
need
not
necessarily
suffer
another
day
or
two
went
by
in
the
silent
rainwrapped
house
under
the
trees
days
of
quiet
footsteps
and
whispering
and
the
lisping
of
wood
fires
then
martin
suddenly
was
conscious
knew
his
wife
languidly
smiled
at
her
thanked
the
doctors
for
occasional
ease
from
pain
peter
i
sorry
it
terrible
for
you
terrible
he
said
in
his
new
hoarse
gentle
voice
when
he
first
saw
peter
they
marvelled
among
themselves
that
he
knew
that
alix
was
gone
but
to
cherry
in
one
of
the
long
hours
that
she
spent
sitting
beside
him
and
holding
his
big
weak
strangely
white
hand
he
explained
one
day
i
knew
she
was
killed
he
said
out
of
a
silence
i
thought
we
both
were
how
did
she
ever
happen
to
do
it
cherry
said
she
was
always
so
sure
of
herself
even
when
she
drove
fast
i
do
know
he
answered
it
was
all
like
a
flash
of
course
i
never
watched
her
drive
i
had
such
confidence
in
her
his
interest
dropped
she
saw
that
the
tide
of
pain
was
slowly
rising
again
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
two
he
might
not
have
relief
until
four
in
his
own
eyes
she
saw
reflected
the
apprehension
of
her
own
you
might
ask
peter
to
play
some
of
that
that
rambly
stuff
he
was
playing
yesterday
he
suggested
cherry
only
too
happy
to
have
him
want
anything
to
have
him
helped
by
anything
flew
to
find
peter
busy
with
one
of
the
trays
that
were
really
beginning
to
interest
and
please
the
invalid
now
she
told
herself
that
the
house
was
a
different
place
now
that
one
nurse
was
gone
the
doctors
coming
only
for
brief
calls
and
the
dear
familiar
sound
of
the
old
piano
echoing
throughout
the
rooms
martin
came
from
the
fiery
furnace
changed
in
soul
and
body
it
was
a
thin
gentle
strangely
patient
man
who
was
propped
in
bed
for
his
thanksgiving
dinner
and
whose
face
turned
with
an
appreciative
smile
to
the
decorations
and
the
gifts
that
made
his
room
cheerful
his
thick
beard
had
grown
for
weeks
they
had
not
dared
disturb
him
to
cut
it
and
as
he
recovered
cherry
found
it
so
becoming
that
she
had
persuaded
him
to
let
it
remain
he
wore
a
wrapper
that
was
his
wife
gift
the
sling
was
gone
but
his
hands
were
oddly
thin
and
white
the
big
room
once
the
study
and
still
shaded
by
the
old
banksia
rose
had
been
turned
into
as
luxurious
a
bedroom
as
cherry
could
make
it
the
signs
of
extreme
illness
gradually
were
banished
and
all
sorts
of
invalid
comforts
took
their
place
daylight
and
lamplight
were
alike
tempered
for
martin
there
were
pillows
screens
there
was
a
noiseless
deep
chair
always
waiting
for
cherry
at
his
side
as
his
unconscious
and
feverish
times
lessened
and
he
was
able
feebly
to
request
this
small
delicacy
or
that
cherry
rejoiced
to
gratify
him
her
voice
had
something
of
its
old
content
as
she
would
say
he
loved
the
oysters
peter
or
doctor
said
he
might
have
wine
jelly
the
heavy
cloud
lightened
slowly
but
steadily
martin
had
a
long
talk
dreaded
by
cherry
from
the
first
hours
of
the
accident
with
his
physicians
he
bore
the
ultimatum
with
unexpected
fortitude
let
me
get
this
straight
he
said
slowly
the
arm
is
and
the
leg
but
the
back
cherry
kneeling
beside
him
her
hands
on
his
drew
a
wincing
breath
martin
reassured
her
with
an
indulgent
nod
i
known
it
right
along
he
told
her
he
looked
at
the
doctors
it
no
go
i
do
see
why
i
should
deceive
you
my
dear
boy
said
the
younger
doctor
who
had
grown
very
fond
of
him
you
can
still
beat
me
at
bridge
you
know
you
can
read
and
write
and
come
to
the
table
after
awhile
you
have
your
devoted
wife
to
keep
finding
new
things
for
you
to
do
next
summer
now
a
chair
out
in
the
garden
cherry
was
fearfully
watching
her
husband
face
we
all
do
what
we
can
to
make
it
easy
mart
she
whispered
in
tears
he
looked
at
her
with
a
whimsical
smile
mind
very
much
taking
care
of
a
helpless
man
all
your
life
he
asked
with
a
hint
of
his
old
confident
manner
oh
mart
i
mind
only
for
you
she
said
peter
standing
behind
the
doctors
slipped
from
the
room
unnoticed
late
that
evening
when
martin
was
asleep
cherry
came
noiselessly
from
the
to
find
peter
alone
in
the
dimly
lighted
sitting
room
the
fire
had
burned
low
and
he
was
sitting
before
it
sunk
into
his
chair
and
leaning
forward
fingers
loosely
locked
and
sombre
eyes
fixed
on
the
dull
pink
glow
of
the
logs
he
looked
tired
cherry
thought
and
was
so
buried
in
thought
that
she
at
first
attempted
to
go
quietly
through
the
room
without
rousing
him
but
he
glanced
at
her
feeling
rather
than
hearing
her
presence
and
called
her
come
over
here
will
you
cherry
i
want
to
speak
to
you
something
in
his
voice
fluttered
her
for
a
second
she
had
not
heard
the
echo
of
the
old
mood
for
a
long
time
she
came
with
an
inquiring
and
yet
not
wholly
unconscious
look
to
the
fireside
and
he
stood
up
to
greet
her
tired
he
asked
in
an
unnatural
voice
i
i
was
just
going
to
bed
she
answered
hesitatingly
but
she
sat
down
nevertheless
sank
comfortably
into
the
chair
opposite
his
own
and
stretched
her
little
feet
crossed
at
the
ankle
before
her
as
if
she
were
indeed
tired
i
do
know
what
should
make
me
always
so
weary
she
said
smiling
i
do
do
a
thing
really
all
day
utterly
relaxed
her
small
figure
in
its
plain
black
gown
with
the
childish
white
she
always
wore
at
collar
and
wrist
looked
like
the
figure
of
a
child
her
golden
hair
shone
with
a
dull
gleam
in
the
dim
light
there
was
a
glint
of
firelight
in
her
dropped
lashes
perhaps
it
the
nervous
strain
peter
suggested
of
course
you
would
feel
that
there
was
a
silence
in
which
neither
moved
cherry
did
not
even
raise
her
eyelids
and
peter
standing
with
one
arm
on
the
mantel
looked
down
at
her
steadily
cherry
he
said
suddenly
are
you
and
i
going
to
talk
to
each
other
like
that
a
flood
of
colour
rose
in
cherry
pale
face
and
she
gave
him
one
appealing
glance
i
do
i
do
think
i
know
what
you
mean
peter
oh
yes
you
do
he
said
he
knelt
down
beside
her
chair
and
gathered
her
cold
hands
into
one
of
his
own
what
are
you
and
i
going
to
do
he
asked
she
looked
at
him
in
terror
but
all
that
is
changed
she
said
quickly
fearfully
why
is
it
changed
he
countered
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
since
the
days
long
ago
in
this
very
house
i
ca
stop
it
now
and
you
love
me
cherry
yes
i
shall
always
love
you
she
answered
agitatedly
after
a
pause
in
which
she
looked
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
i
shall
always
love
you
and
always
dream
of
the
time
when
we
we
thought
we
might
belong
to
each
other
peter
but
but
you
must
see
that
we
can
not
can
not
think
of
all
that
now
she
added
with
difficulty
i
could
fail
martin
now
when
he
needs
me
so
he
needs
you
now
peter
conceded
and
i
do
ask
you
to
do
anything
that
must
distress
him
now
but
in
a
few
months
when
his
mother
comes
down
for
a
visit
what
then
cherry
exquisite
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
well
what
then
she
whispered
then
you
must
tell
them
honestly
that
you
care
for
me
he
said
cherry
was
trembling
violently
but
how
could
i
she
protested
tell
him
that
i
am
going
away
deserting
him
when
he
most
needs
me
peter
had
grown
very
pale
but
he
stammered
his
face
close
to
hers
but
you
can
not
mean
that
this
is
the
end
she
moved
her
lips
as
if
she
was
about
to
speak
looked
at
him
blankly
then
suddenly
tears
came
and
she
wrenched
her
hands
free
from
his
and
laid
her
arms
about
his
neck
her
wet
cheek
was
pressed
to
his
own
and
he
put
his
arms
tightly
about
the
little
shaken
figure
peter
she
whispered
desolately
and
after
a
time
when
the
violence
of
her
sobs
was
lessened
and
she
was
breathing
more
quietly
she
said
again
peter
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
dried
her
eyes
and
she
remained
resting
against
him
like
a
spent
bird
her
blue
eyes
fixed
mournfully
on
the
fire
her
hands
which
had
slipped
to
his
breast
gathered
in
his
own
and
her
bright
head
on
his
shoulder
we
can
never
dream
that
dream
again
she
said
we
shall
dream
it
again
he
corrected
her
cherry
did
not
answer
for
a
long
while
then
she
gently
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
and
sat
erect
her
tears
were
ended
now
and
her
voice
firmer
and
surer
no
never
again
she
told
him
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
these
days
and
i
come
to
see
what
is
right
as
i
never
did
before
alix
never
knew
about
us
peter
and
that
been
the
one
thing
for
which
i
could
be
thankful
in
all
this
time
but
alix
had
only
one
hope
for
me
and
that
was
that
somehow
martin
and
i
would
come
to
be
well
to
be
nearer
to
each
other
and
that
somehow
he
and
i
would
make
a
success
of
our
marriage
would
spare
well
let
say
the
family
name
from
all
the
disgrace
and
publicity
of
a
divorce
and
you
feel
that
this
has
drawn
you
and
martin
nearer
together
peter
asked
in
a
simple
expressionless
voice
as
she
paused
well
he
needs
me
now
but
cherry
my
child
peter
expostulated
you
can
not
sacrifice
all
your
life
to
the
fancy
that
no
one
else
can
take
your
place
with
him
that
she
said
steadily
is
just
what
i
must
do
peter
looked
at
her
for
a
few
seconds
without
speaking
you
do
love
him
he
said
no
she
admitted
gravely
i
do
love
him
not
in
the
way
you
mean
he
is
nothing
to
you
peter
argued
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
never
was
what
a
marriage
should
be
it
was
always
always
a
mistake
yes
she
conceded
sadly
it
was
always
a
mistake
then
there
is
nothing
to
bind
you
to
him
peter
added
no
and
there
is
alix
to
distress
now
she
agreed
thoughtfully
and
yet
she
went
on
suddenly
i
do
this
more
for
alix
than
for
any
one
peter
looked
at
her
in
silence
looked
back
at
the
last
flicker
of
the
fire
you
will
change
your
mind
after
awhile
he
said
cherry
rose
from
the
chair
and
stood
with
dropped
head
and
troubled
eyes
looking
down
at
the
flame
no
i
shall
never
change
my
mind
she
said
in
a
low
tone
that
was
still
strangely
firm
and
final
for
her
i
have
thought
about
it
about
the
sacrifices
i
shall
have
to
make
and
about
what
my
life
will
be
as
the
years
go
on
and
i
know
that
i
never
will
change
this
is
as
much
my
life
as
it
would
be
my
life
if
you
and
i
were
alone
in
that
little
french
village
somewhere
there
would
be
no
going
back
then
no
thinking
of
what
might
have
been
there
is
no
going
back
now
this
is
my
life
that
all
for
five
or
ten
or
twenty
or
thirty
years
i
shall
always
be
where
martin
is
caring
for
him
amusing
him
making
a
life
for
him
and
cherry
raised
her
glorious
blue
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
pure
and
an
uplifted
look
that
peter
had
never
seen
there
before
it
is
what
dad
and
alix
would
have
wished
she
finished
solemnly
and
i
do
it
for
them
peter
did
not
answer
and
after
a
moment
she
went
quietly
and
quickly
from
the
room
with
the
new
air
of
quiet
responsibility
that
she
had
worn
ever
since
the
accident
chapter
xxiv
peter
saw
with
a
sort
of
stupefaction
that
life
was
satisfying
her
now
as
life
had
never
satisfied
restless
exacting
little
cherry
before
not
that
she
knew
it
she
was
absolutely
unconscious
of
the
truth
and
he
realized
that
she
would
have
been
genuinely
shocked
by
it
but
there
was
a
busy
energy
about
her
now
an
absorbed
and
contented
concentration
upon
the
duties
of
the
day
a
cheerfulness
a
philosophy
that
were
new
there
had
been
touched
by
all
this
terrible
time
unexpected
deeps
of
maternal
tenderness
in
childish
little
cherry
there
had
been
unsuspected
qualities
of
domesticity
and
sacrifice
a
new
cherry
had
been
born
a
cherry
always
beautiful
always
resourceful
always
admired
busy
with
martin
trays
out
in
the
garden
searching
for
shy
violets
conferring
with
the
chinese
boy
pouring
tea
for
afternoon
callers
cherry
was
newly
adequate
and
newly
happy
she
spent
much
of
her
free
time
by
her
husband
side
amusing
him
as
skillfully
as
a
mother
what
was
she
doing
why
she
was
simply
basting
fresh
cuffs
into
her
afternoon
gown
he
was
getting
so
popular
that
she
had
to
be
ready
for
callers
every
day
would
he
like
her
to
keep
george
sewall
for
dinner
then
they
could
play
dominoes
again
would
he
like
the
table
with
the
picture
puzzle
he
would
like
just
to
talk
very
well
they
would
talk
martin
day
was
so
filled
and
divided
with
small
pleasures
that
it
was
apt
to
amaze
him
by
passing
too
quickly
he
had
special
breakfasts
he
had
his
paper
his
hair
was
brushed
and
his
bed
remade
a
dozen
times
a
day
cherry
shared
her
mail
which
was
always
heavy
now
with
him
she
flitted
into
the
every
few
minutes
with
small
messages
or
gifts
with
her
bare
bright
head
her
busy
white
hands
her
voice
all
motherly
amusement
and
sympathy
and
sweetness
she
had
never
seemed
so
much
a
wife
she
had
the
pleasantest
laugh
in
the
world
and
she
often
laughed
the
was
kept
with
exquisite
simplicity
with
such
freshness
bareness
and
order
as
made
it
a
place
of
delight
one
day
cherry
brought
home
a
great
vikory
bowl
of
silvery
glass
and
a
dozen
drifting
goldfish
and
martin
never
tired
of
watching
them
idly
while
he
listened
to
her
reading
cherry
peter
said
on
a
wet
january
day
when
he
came
upon
her
in
the
dining
room
contentedly
arranging
a
fragrant
mass
of
wet
violets
i
think
martin
out
of
the
woods
now
i
believe
i
be
moving
along
oh
but
we
want
you
always
peter
she
said
innocently
regretful
the
ghost
of
a
pained
smile
flitted
across
his
face
thank
you
he
said
gently
but
i
think
i
will
go
he
added
mildly
she
made
no
further
protest
but
where
she
asked
sympathetically
i
do
know
i
shall
take
buck
start
off
toward
the
big
mountains
i
write
you
now
and
then
of
course
i
going
home
first
of
course
she
answered
but
you
wo
stay
in
that
lonely
cabin
all
alone
she
added
almost
timidly
no
i
sha
be
there
long
he
assured
her
briefly
finished
up
now
i
leaving
kow
in
charge
of
course
i
be
back
one
of
these
days
just
now
cherry
mused
sadly
perhaps
it
is
best
for
you
to
get
away
now
that
martin
is
so
much
better
she
added
in
a
little
burst
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
you
peter
i
know
how
you
feel
i
shall
miss
her
always
of
course
said
cherry
but
i
have
him
i
try
not
to
think
of
her
peter
said
flinging
up
his
head
when
you
do
cherry
said
earnestly
giving
him
more
of
her
attention
than
had
been
usual
of
late
here
is
something
to
think
peter
this
we
have
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
because
she
never
knew
it
was
madness
cherry
went
on
eagerly
sheer
madness
that
is
clear
now
i
do
try
to
explain
it
because
it
all
been
washed
away
by
the
frightful
thing
that
happened
i
different
now
different
i
do
know
how
we
ever
thought
we
could
but
i
forget
all
that
she
went
on
after
a
moment
of
shamed
thought
i
do
let
myself
think
of
it
any
more
i
was
unhappy
i
was
overwrought
there
no
explanation
for
what
i
felt
and
said
but
that
and
peter
you
know
that
if
i
was
false
in
thought
to
martin
he
had
been
unkind
to
me
and
he
had
she
paused
interrupted
herself
but
men
are
different
i
suppose
she
mused
there
was
a
silence
during
which
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
but
the
expression
on
his
face
did
not
alter
and
he
did
not
speak
and
what
i
think
we
ought
to
be
thankful
for
she
resumed
is
that
alix
would
rather
she
would
rather
have
it
this
way
she
told
me
that
she
would
be
heartbroken
if
there
had
been
any
actual
separation
between
me
and
martin
and
how
much
worse
that
would
have
been
what
we
planned
i
mean
she
was
spared
that
and
we
were
spared
i
see
it
now
what
would
have
ruined
both
our
lives
we
were
brought
to
our
senses
and
the
awakening
only
came
a
little
sooner
than
it
would
have
come
anyway
peter
had
walked
to
the
window
and
was
looking
out
at
the
shabby
winter
trees
that
were
dripping
rain
and
at
the
beaten
garden
where
the
drenched
chrysanthemums
had
been
bowed
to
the
soaked
earth
a
wet
wind
swished
through
the
low
fanlike
branches
of
the
redwoods
the
creek
was
rushing
high
and
noisily
here
in
dad
home
cherry
said
coming
to
stand
beside
him
i
see
how
wicked
and
how
mad
i
was
in
another
hours
it
would
have
been
too
late
you
do
know
how
often
i
wake
up
in
the
night
and
shiver
thinking
that
and
as
it
is
i
am
here
in
the
dear
old
house
and
martin
well
you
can
see
that
even
martin
life
is
going
to
be
far
happier
than
it
ever
was
yesterday
porter
spoke
to
me
about
getting
him
a
when
he
is
stronger
you
know
doctor
young
comes
in
to
play
cribbage
with
him
it
amazing
how
the
day
fills
itself
it
such
a
joy
to
me
she
added
with
the
radiant
look
she
often
wore
when
her
husband
comfort
was
under
consideration
to
feel
that
we
need
never
worry
about
the
money
end
of
things
there
enough
for
what
we
need
forever
you
must
never
worry
about
money
he
told
her
and
if
ever
you
need
it
if
it
is
a
question
of
a
long
trip
or
of
more
operations
if
there
is
any
chance
i
shall
remember
that
i
have
a
big
brother
she
said
the
room
was
scented
by
the
sweet
damp
flowers
and
by
the
good
odour
of
lazily
burning
logs
yet
to
peter
there
was
chill
and
desolateness
in
the
air
cherry
took
up
the
glass
bowl
in
both
careful
hands
and
went
away
in
the
direction
of
the
study
but
he
stood
at
the
window
for
a
long
time
staring
dully
out
at
the
battered
chrysanthemums
and
the
swishing
branches
and
the
steadily
falling
rain
chapter
xxv
a
few
days
later
on
a
day
of
uncertain
sunshine
and
showers
peter
left
them
martin
was
the
sorrier
of
the
two
to
see
him
go
for
it
seemed
to
martin
that
the
tragedy
had
united
cherry
and
himself
in
a
peculiar
manner
had
rounded
and
secured
their
relationship
and
had
made
for
them
a
new
life
that
had
no
place
for
peter
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
pity
for
the
older
man
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
him
stay
longer
to
play
the
old
piano
work
in
the
old
garden
and
share
their
talks
of
alix
and
of
all
the
old
days
but
to
cherry
going
was
a
relief
it
burned
one
more
bridge
behind
her
it
confirmed
her
in
the
path
she
had
chosen
it
was
to
her
spirit
like
the
cap
that
marks
the
accepted
student
nurse
or
like
the
black
coif
that
replaces
the
postulant
white
veil
of
probation
he
had
been
in
the
downstairs
bedroom
talking
with
martin
for
perhaps
an
hour
he
had
drawn
them
a
rough
sketch
of
the
little
addition
to
the
house
that
cherry
meant
some
day
to
build
next
to
the
study
and
he
and
martin
had
been
discussing
the
details
cherry
had
left
them
there
and
was
sweeping
the
wet
leaves
from
the
old
porch
in
a
pale
shaft
of
sunshine
and
thinking
that
there
must
be
a
wide
railing
here
next
summer
for
martin
books
and
a
gay
awning
to
be
drawn
or
furled
as
martin
fancied
when
a
sudden
step
in
the
doorway
behind
her
made
her
look
up
peter
had
come
out
of
the
house
with
buck
curving
beside
him
he
wore
his
old
corduroy
clothes
and
his
shabby
cap
but
there
was
something
in
his
aspect
that
made
her
ask
not
going
yes
i
going
now
he
said
she
rested
her
broom
against
the
thick
trunk
of
the
old
banksia
and
rubbed
her
two
hands
together
and
came
to
the
top
of
the
steps
to
say
and
standing
there
under
the
rose
tree
she
linked
her
arm
about
it
looking
up
through
the
branches
where
the
shabby
foliage
of
last
year
lingered
how
fast
it
grown
since
that
terrific
pruning
we
gave
it
all
that
long
time
ago
she
said
little
more
than
six
years
ago
cherry
he
reminded
her
only
six
years
she
was
obviously
amazed
it
does
seem
possible
that
all
this
has
happened
in
six
years
she
exclaimed
those
were
wonderful
old
days
with
anne
and
alix
scolding
you
and
dad
here
looking
out
for
us
all
she
mused
tenderly
never
be
so
happy
again
he
did
not
answer
he
had
her
hand
now
for
farewells
and
perhaps
with
the
thought
of
those
short
six
years
had
come
also
the
thought
that
this
slender
figure
in
the
housewifely
blue
linen
this
exquisite
little
head
so
trim
and
demure
despite
all
its
rebel
tendrils
of
gold
this
lovely
face
still
the
face
of
a
child
with
a
child
trusting
uplifted
eyes
might
have
been
his
the
old
home
might
have
been
their
home
and
perhaps
who
knows
there
might
have
been
a
new
cherry
and
a
new
peter
beginning
to
look
eagerly
out
at
life
through
the
screen
of
the
old
rose
vine
too
late
now
a
single
instant
of
those
lost
years
might
have
bought
him
all
this
but
there
was
no
going
back
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
said
god
bless
you
cherry
god
bless
you
dear
she
answered
gravely
she
watched
the
tall
figure
with
its
little
limp
and
with
the
dog
leaping
and
circling
about
it
in
ecstasy
until
the
redwoods
closed
around
him
then
she
took
up
the
broom
again
and
slowly
and
thoughtfully
crossed
the
old
porch
and
shut
the
door
peter
walking
with
long
strides
and
with
a
furrowed
brow
and
absent
eyes
crossed
the
village
and
climbed
once
more
the
old
trail
that
led
up
to
the
cabin
his
great
boots
made
simple
work
of
the
muddy
roads
his
hands
were
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
shabby
old
coat
and
his
cap
pulled
low
the
rain
had
stopped
but
every
branch
that
hung
down
over
his
path
or
stretched
an
arm
to
stop
him
was
charged
with
water
the
creeks
were
swollen
and
yellow
and
raced
along
between
crumbling
banks
with
a
fresh
rushing
sound
that
mingled
with
the
creaking
of
wet
boughs
and
the
wild
spring
chant
of
the
wind
high
up
in
the
tops
of
the
redwoods
coming
out
of
the
forest
on
the
ridge
where
the
dim
road
ran
under
the
scattered
oaks
he
saw
the
last
of
the
battle
of
the
dying
storm
raging
over
the
valley
below
great
masses
of
cloud
were
in
travail
when
the
sun
was
hidden
the
world
was
wrapped
in
shade
and
chill
when
it
burst
forth
every
wet
tree
and
spear
glistened
and
twinkled
in
the
flood
of
warmth
and
light
the
dried
brown
grass
sparkled
with
jewels
and
the
great
roadside
rain
pools
flashed
back
the
azure
of
the
sky
the
mountain
was
partly
obscured
by
rapidly
shifting
masses
of
mist
the
air
was
pungent
and
seemed
to
hum
with
a
thousand
tiny
electric
voices
already
there
was
new
grass
showing
a
timid
film
of
emerald
under
the
brown
growth
of
last
year
while
peter
climbed
the
good
earth
giving
soddenly
under
his
feet
and
grasses
tangling
in
the
clasps
of
his
walking
shoes
the
sunlight
conquered
the
sky
cleared
and
the
last
of
the
storm
drifted
and
spread
and
vanished
in
a
bath
of
dazzling
blue
birds
began
to
circle
in
brief
flights
cloud
shadows
fell
on
the
west
dark
flank
of
the
mountain
and
in
the
saturated
marshy
spots
where
a
scummy
green
growth
already
was
spread
over
the
crystal
pools
of
the
little
hillside
springs
frogs
were
exultant
the
roof
of
the
little
cabin
and
the
outbuildings
smoked
up
into
the
pure
warm
air
the
jersey
placidly
awaiting
her
hour
looked
at
him
with
soft
great
eyes
and
alix
chickens
picked
and
squawked
on
the
steaming
mound
near
the
stable
kow
was
hanging
out
the
blue
everything
everything
was
as
he
had
found
it
a
hundred
a
thousand
happy
times
peter
spoke
to
the
chinese
and
went
into
the
cabin
it
was
dusted
orderly
complete
he
and
alix
might
have
left
it
yesterday
kow
had
seen
him
coming
he
thought
and
had
had
time
to
light
the
fire
which
was
blazing
freshly
up
to
the
chimney
great
throat
he
sat
down
staring
at
the
flames
buck
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
between
the
pantry
and
the
sitting
room
and
came
in
a
question
in
his
bright
eyes
his
great
plumy
tail
beating
the
floor
as
he
lay
down
at
peter
side
presently
the
dog
laid
his
nose
on
peter
knee
and
poured
forth
a
faint
sound
that
was
not
quite
a
whine
not
quite
a
sigh
and
rose
restlessly
and
went
to
the
closed
door
of
alix
room
and
pawed
it
his
eager
nose
to
the
threshold
not
here
old
fellow
peter
said
stroking
the
silky
head
under
his
hand
he
had
not
been
in
this
room
since
the
day
of
her
death
it
struck
him
as
strangely
changed
strangely
and
heartrendingly
familiar
the
windows
were
closed
as
alix
had
never
had
them
closed
winter
or
summer
rain
or
sunshine
her
books
stood
in
their
old
order
her
student
shakespere
and
some
of
her
girlhood
books
little
women
and
uncle
max
in
the
closet
which
exhaled
a
damp
and
woody
smell
were
one
or
two
of
the
hats
he
had
so
often
seen
her
crush
carelessly
over
her
dark
hair
and
the
big
belted
coat
that
was
as
plain
as
his
own
and
the
big
boots
she
wore
when
she
tramped
about
the
poultry
yard
still
spattered
with
pale
dry
mud
her
father
worn
little
bible
lay
on
the
table
and
beside
it
another
book
duck
raising
for
the
market
with
the
marks
of
muddy
and
mealy
hands
still
lingering
on
its
cover
suddenly
evoked
by
these
silent
witnesses
to
her
busy
and
happy
life
the
whole
woman
seemed
to
stand
beside
peter
the
tall
eager
vital
woman
who
had
been
at
home
here
who
had
ruled
the
cabin
with
a
splendid
and
vital
personality
he
seemed
to
feel
her
near
him
again
to
see
the
interested
eyes
the
high
touched
with
scarlet
the
wisp
of
hair
that
would
fall
across
her
face
sometimes
when
she
was
deep
in
baking
or
preserving
or
and
that
she
would
brush
away
with
the
back
of
an
impatient
hand
only
to
have
it
slip
loose
again
one
of
her
kitchen
aprons
caught
in
the
current
of
air
from
the
opened
door
blew
about
on
its
hook
he
remembered
her
on
many
a
wintry
day
buttoned
into
just
such
a
crisp
apron
radiantly
busy
and
brisk
in
her
kitchen
stirring
and
chopping
moving
constantly
between
stove
and
table
with
strong
hands
still
showing
traces
of
flour
she
would
come
to
sit
beside
him
at
the
piano
to
play
a
duet
with
her
characteristic
dash
and
finish
only
to
jump
up
in
sudden
compunction
with
an
exclamation
oh
my
ducks
i
forgotten
them
oh
the
poor
little
wretches
and
she
would
be
gone
leaving
a
streak
of
wet
fresh
air
through
the
warm
house
from
the
open
door
and
he
would
perhaps
glance
from
a
window
to
see
her
roughly
coated
and
booted
ploughing
about
her
duck
yard
delving
into
barrels
of
grain
turning
on
faucets
wielding
a
stubby
old
broom
she
loved
her
life
he
mused
with
a
bitter
heartache
as
he
stood
here
in
her
empty
room
sometimes
he
had
marvelled
at
the
complete
and
unquestioning
joy
she
had
brought
to
it
books
puzzles
music
and
fires
sufficed
her
in
the
few
hours
that
she
ever
spent
in
her
own
drawing
room
for
the
rest
she
had
the
kitchen
and
the
farmyard
and
the
world
out
of
doors
the
oaks
and
the
grass
the
great
stretches
of
dim
forest
the
muddy
trails
the
blowing
airs
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
that
made
her
shout
and
stagger
in
their
wild
onslaught
peter
reminded
himself
that
never
in
their
years
together
had
he
heard
her
complain
about
anything
or
seem
to
feel
bored
or
at
a
loss
we
always
thought
of
cherry
as
the
child
he
thought
but
it
was
she
alix
who
was
the
real
child
she
never
grew
up
she
never
entered
into
the
time
of
moods
and
and
jealousies
and
desires
she
would
have
played
and
picnicked
all
her
life
his
heart
pressed
like
a
dull
pain
in
his
chest
dully
quietly
he
went
out
to
the
fire
again
and
dully
and
quietly
moved
through
the
day
her
books
and
music
might
stand
as
they
were
her
potted
ferns
and
her
scattered
small
possessions
the
that
she
always
handled
with
a
boy
awkwardness
and
the
camera
she
used
so
well
should
keep
their
places
but
he
went
to
her
desk
thinking
in
this
long
solitary
evening
to
destroy
various
papers
that
she
might
wish
destroyed
before
the
cabin
was
deserted
and
here
he
found
her
letter
he
found
it
only
after
he
had
somewhat
explored
the
different
small
drawers
and
pigeonholes
of
the
desk
drawers
and
pigeonholes
which
were
to
his
surprise
all
in
astonishing
order
for
alix
everything
was
marked
tied
pocketed
her
accounts
were
balanced
and
if
she
had
anywhere
left
private
papers
they
were
at
least
nowhere
to
be
found
seeing
in
all
this
a
dread
confirmation
of
his
first
suspicion
of
her
death
peter
nevertheless
experienced
a
shock
when
he
found
her
letter
it
had
been
placed
in
an
empty
drawer
face
up
and
was
sealed
and
addressed
simply
with
his
name
he
sat
holding
it
in
his
hand
and
moments
passed
before
he
could
open
it
so
it
had
been
true
then
the
fear
that
he
had
tried
all
these
weeks
to
crush
he
had
been
weighing
measuring
remembering
until
his
very
soul
was
sick
with
the
uncertainty
his
mind
had
been
a
confused
web
of
memories
of
this
casual
word
and
that
look
of
what
she
had
possibly
heard
had
probably
seen
had
suspected
known
now
he
would
know
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
the
dozen
written
lines
were
before
his
eyes
the
letter
was
dated
a
most
unusual
thing
for
alix
to
do
and
saturday
one
was
written
under
the
date
it
was
the
day
of
her
death
he
read
peter
dear
do
feel
too
badly
if
i
find
a
stupid
way
out
i
been
thinking
for
several
days
about
it
you
done
so
much
for
me
and
after
you
of
course
there
no
one
but
cherry
she
could
be
free
now
he
could
prevent
it
when
i
saw
your
face
a
few
minutes
ago
i
knew
we
could
fight
it
remember
this
is
our
secret
and
always
remember
that
i
want
you
to
be
happy
because
i
love
you
so
it
was
unsigned
peter
sat
staring
at
it
for
awhile
without
moving
without
the
stir
of
a
changing
expression
on
his
face
then
he
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
went
out
to
the
backyard
where
kow
was
feeding
the
chickens
the
wet
dark
day
was
ending
brilliantly
in
a
wash
of
red
sunset
light
that
sent
long
shadows
from
the
young
fruit
trees
and
touched
every
twig
with
a
dull
glow
kow
peter
said
after
an
effort
to
speak
that
was
unsuccessful
the
chinese
boy
looked
at
him
solicitously
for
peter
face
was
ashen
and
about
his
mouth
were
drawn
lines
kow
he
said
i
go
now
go
now
other
house
kow
nodded
glancing
down
toward
the
valley
but
peter
jerked
his
head
instead
toward
the
bare
ridge
no
i
go
now
not
come
back
he
said
briefly
maybe
bolinas
inverness
i
do
know
by
and
by
the
big
mountains
kow
by
and
by
i
forget
tears
glittered
in
the
chinese
boy
eyes
but
he
smiled
with
a
great
air
of
cheer
i
keep
house
he
promised
the
dog
came
fawning
and
springing
from
the
stables
and
peter
whistled
to
him
come
on
buck
we
going
now
he
opened
the
farmyard
gate
where
her
hand
had
so
often
rested
crossed
the
muddy
corral
opened
another
gate
and
struck
off
across
the
darkening
world
toward
the
ridge
the
last
sunlight
lingered
on
crest
and
treetop
tangled
itself
redly
in
the
uppermost
branches
of
a
few
tall
redwoods
and
was
gone
twilight
a
long
twilight
that
had
in
it
some
hint
of
spring
lay
softly
over
the
valley
the
mountain
loomed
high
in
the
clear
shadow
gaining
the
top
of
the
first
ridge
he
paused
and
looked
back
lights
were
beginning
to
prick
forth
in
the
brown
houses
of
the
valley
buried
in
their
trees
the
busy
little
mountain
train
descending
puffed
forth
smoke
and
steam
far
away
the
silver
ribbons
of
the
canals
wound
through
the
marsh
and
beyond
the
bay
the
oakland
shore
lay
like
a
chain
of
gems
in
the
pale
twilight
peter
looked
at
the
cabin
the
little
brown
house
that
he
had
built
almost
fifteen
years
ago
he
remembered
that
it
was
in
the
beginning
a
sort
of
experiment
his
mother
and
he
were
too
much
alone
in
their
big
city
house
and
she
had
suggested
with
rare
wisdom
that
as
he
did
not
care
for
society
and
as
his
travels
always
meant
great
loneliness
for
her
he
should
have
a
little
eyrie
of
his
own
to
which
he
might
retreat
whenever
the
fancy
touched
him
she
liked
del
monte
and
tahoe
herself
but
she
had
come
to
mill
valley
now
and
then
in
the
days
of
his
first
wild
delight
in
its
freedom
and
beauty
and
and
very
much
disliking
dust
she
had
sent
him
plants
roses
and
fruit
trees
and
she
had
told
him
one
day
that
he
had
a
neighbour
in
the
valley
who
was
an
old
friend
of
hers
a
doctor
strickland
a
widower
with
children
he
remembered
sauntering
up
the
opposite
canyon
to
duly
call
upon
this
one
day
and
his
delight
upon
finding
a
philosophic
erratic
man
who
had
at
once
recognized
a
kindred
spirit
and
who
had
made
the
younger
man
warmly
welcome
presently
on
the
first
call
an
enchanting
little
girl
in
a
shabby
smock
had
come
in
a
little
girl
all
dimples
demureness
and
untouched
babyish
beauty
she
had
said
that
anne
wath
mad
wiv
her
and
that
alix
she
managed
to
lisp
the
name
wath
up
in
the
madrone
a
somewhat
older
child
named
alix
a
freckled
leggy
little
person
with
enormous
front
teeth
had
proved
the
claim
by
falling
out
of
the
madrone
and
had
received
no
sympathy
for
a
bump
but
a
to
him
rather
surprising
censure
he
had
yet
to
realize
that
nothing
ever
hurt
alix
but
that
she
always
ruined
her
clothes
and
frequently
hurt
other
persons
and
other
things
he
found
her
a
spirited
enthusiastic
little
person
extremely
articulate
and
quite
unselfconscious
and
she
had
entertained
him
with
an
excited
account
of
a
sex
feud
that
was
being
pushed
with
some
violence
at
her
school
and
had
used
expressions
that
rather
shocked
peter
a
quiet
third
girl
a
niece
he
gathered
had
joined
the
group
a
girl
with
braids
and
clean
hands
who
elucidated
alix
and
i
do
like
our
teacher
she
a
sneak
and
a
skunk
alix
had
frankly
contributed
cherry
now
quietly
established
in
her
father
lap
had
smiled
with
mischievous
enjoyment
nobody
else
to
peter
surprise
had
paid
this
extraordinary
remark
the
slightest
attention
he
remembered
that
he
had
fancied
only
the
smallest
of
these
children
and
had
been
glad
when
they
all
went
out
of
the
room
but
after
that
alix
used
often
to
amuse
him
and
he
always
felt
more
at
home
with
her
than
with
the
other
two
she
had
only
been
a
gawky
and
thin
fifteen
or
sixteen
when
she
began
to
assert
herself
in
his
kitchen
dictate
to
kow
and
waste
good
butter
and
eggs
on
experiments
he
had
secretly
rather
admired
her
quick
tongue
and
her
daring
he
liked
her
to
ride
his
horses
and
was
amazed
at
the
speed
with
which
she
grasped
the
controlling
principles
of
the
he
had
seen
her
move
plants
treat
sick
chickens
sew
up
the
gashed
head
of
a
horse
with
her
own
fingers
while
cherry
lovely
immaculate
in
white
ruffles
watched
her
with
fear
and
admiration
looking
down
at
the
cabin
the
years
slipped
past
him
like
a
flying
film
and
it
was
the
present
again
and
alix
alix
was
gone
he
roused
himself
spoke
to
the
dog
and
they
went
on
their
way
again
mud
squelched
beneath
peter
boots
in
the
roadway
the
dog
sprang
lightly
from
clump
to
clump
of
dried
grass
but
when
they
left
the
road
and
cut
straight
across
the
rise
of
the
hillside
the
ground
was
firmer
and
the
two
figures
moved
swiftly
through
the
dark
night
the
early
stars
came
out
and
showed
them
silhouetted
against
the
sky
above
alix
beloved
tamalpais
the
man
erect
form
with
its
slight
limp
the
dog
following
faithfully
his
plumy
tail
and
feathered
ruff
showing
a
dull
lustre
in
the
starlight
cherry
with
her
violet
eyes
and
hair
cherry
with
her
little
hands
gathered
in
his
and
her
heart
beating
against
his
heart
and
alix
his
chum
his
companion
his
comrade
on
so
many
night
walks
under
the
stars
he
had
lost
them
both
but
it
was
alix
who
was
closest
to
his
thoughts
alix
the
thought
of
whom
was
gradually
gripping
his
heart
and
soul
with
a
new
pain
alix
was
his
own
cherry
had
never
been
his
own
it
was
for
him
to
comfort
cherry
it
had
always
been
his
mission
to
comfort
cherry
since
the
days
of
her
broken
dolls
and
cut
fingers
but
alix
was
his
own
comforter
and
alix
might
have
been
laughing
and
stumbling
and
chattering
beside
him
here
in
the
dark
wet
woods
full
of
a
happy
satisfaction
in
the
moment
and
confidence
in
the
morrow
alix
my
wife
he
said
softly
aloud
i
loved
cherry
always
but
you
were
mine
you
were
mine
we
belonged
to
each
other
for
better
and
for
worse
and
i
have
let
you
go
he
went
on
and
on
and
on
they
were
plunging
down
hill
now
under
the
trees
he
would
see
a
light
after
awhile
and
sleep
for
a
few
hours
and
have
a
hunter
breakfast
and
be
gone
again
and
he
knew
that
for
weeks
for
months
perhaps
for
years
he
would
wander
so
through
the
great
mountains
with
their
snow
and
their
forests
over
the
seas
in
strange
cities
and
stranger
solitudes
always
alone
always
moving
always
remembering
that
would
be
his
life
and
some
day
some
day
perhaps
he
would
come
back
to
the
valley
she
had
loved
but
even
now
he
recoiled
in
distaste
from
that
hour
to
see
the
familiar
faces
to
come
up
to
the
cabin
again
to
touch
the
music
and
the
books
worse
to
find
cherry
a
little
older
happy
and
busy
in
her
life
of
sacrifice
not
needing
him
not
very
much
wanting
the
reminder
of
the
old
tragic
times
an
owl
cried
in
the
woods
the
mournful
sound
floated
and
drifted
away
into
utter
silence
some
small
animal
meeting
the
death
its
brief
life
had
evaded
a
hundred
times
screamed
shrilly
and
was
silent
great
branches
stirred
by
the
night
wind
moved
high
above
his
head
and
when
there
was
utter
silence
peter
could
hear
the
steady
soft
rush
of
the
ocean
dulled
here
to
the
sound
of
gigantic
quiet
breathing
suddenly
she
seemed
again
to
be
beside
him
he
seemed
to
see
the
dark
animated
face
the
slender
tall
girl
wrapped
in
her
big
rough
coat
he
seemed
to
hear
her
vibrating
voice
with
that
new
tender
note
in
it
that
he
had
noticed
when
she
last
spoke
to
him
i
go
home
ahead
of
you
peter
and
wait
for
you
there
tears
suddenly
flooded
his
eyes
and
he
put
his
hand
over
them
and
pressed
it
there
standing
still
while
the
wave
of
tender
and
poignant
and
exquisite
memories
broke
over
him
we
go
on
buck
he
whispered
looking
up
through
the
trees
at
a
strip
of
dark
sky
spangled
with
cold
stars
we
go
on
she
waiting
for
us
somewhere
old
fellow
the
end
