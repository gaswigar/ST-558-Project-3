beautiful
coat
illustration
all
the
joyous
sounds
of
all
the
year
there
is
none
more
loved
by
peter
rabbit
and
the
rest
of
us
for
that
matter
than
the
soft
whistle
of
winsome
bluebird
in
the
spring
the
first
time
peter
hears
it
he
always
jumps
up
in
the
air
kicks
his
long
heels
together
and
does
a
funny
little
dance
of
pure
joy
for
he
knows
that
winsome
bluebird
is
the
herald
of
sweet
mistress
spring
and
that
she
is
not
far
behind
him
it
is
the
end
of
the
shivery
sad
time
and
the
beginning
of
the
happy
glad
time
and
peter
rejoices
when
he
hears
that
sweet
soft
voice
which
is
sometimes
so
hard
to
locate
seeming
to
come
from
everywhere
and
nowhere
so
peter
loves
winsome
bluebird
and
never
tires
of
seeing
him
about
you
know
he
wears
a
very
very
beautiful
coat
of
blue
the
blue
of
the
sky
when
it
is
softest
and
you
love
to
lie
on
your
back
and
look
up
into
it
and
dream
and
dream
it
always
has
seemed
to
peter
that
winsome
coat
is
one
of
the
loveliest
he
ever
has
seen
as
indeed
it
is
and
that
it
is
quite
right
and
proper
and
just
as
it
should
be
that
one
having
such
a
beautiful
voice
and
bringing
such
a
beautiful
message
should
himself
be
beautiful
he
said
as
much
one
day
when
he
had
run
over
to
the
smiling
pool
to
pay
his
respects
to
grandfather
frog
certainly
of
course
replied
grandfather
frog
winsome
bluebird
has
a
beautiful
nature
and
his
beautiful
coat
is
the
reward
which
old
mother
nature
has
given
him
it
has
been
in
the
family
ever
since
his
grandfather
a
thousand
times
removed
was
brave
enough
to
become
the
herald
of
mistress
oh
grandfather
frog
that
sounds
like
a
story
cried
peter
please
please
tell
it
to
me
for
i
love
winsome
bluebird
and
i
know
i
shall
love
him
more
when
i
have
learned
more
about
him
his
must
have
done
something
very
fine
to
have
won
such
a
lovely
he
did
replied
grandfather
frog
he
became
the
herald
of
mistress
spring
when
no
one
else
would
and
bravely
carried
his
message
of
gladness
and
joy
where
it
was
sadly
needed
in
spite
of
cold
and
hardship
which
no
one
else
was
willing
to
please
please
tell
me
all
about
it
begged
peter
grandfather
frog
appeared
to
consider
for
a
few
minutes
and
peter
waited
anxiously
then
grandfather
frog
cleared
his
voice
i
will
said
he
because
you
ought
to
know
it
everybody
ought
to
know
it
and
winsome
bluebird
certainly
never
will
tell
it
himself
he
is
too
modest
for
that
it
happened
a
great
while
ago
when
the
world
was
young
bluebird
was
one
of
the
quietest
and
most
modest
of
all
the
birds
he
wore
just
a
modest
gray
coat
and
no
one
took
any
particular
notice
of
him
in
fact
he
did
even
have
a
name
he
never
quarreled
with
his
neighbors
he
never
was
envious
of
those
to
whom
old
mother
nature
had
given
beautiful
coats
or
if
he
were
he
never
showed
it
he
just
minded
his
own
affairs
and
did
his
best
to
do
his
share
of
the
work
of
the
great
world
for
even
in
the
beginning
of
things
there
was
something
for
each
one
to
do
old
mother
nature
was
very
busy
those
days
making
the
great
world
a
fit
place
in
which
to
live
and
as
soon
as
she
had
started
a
new
family
of
birds
or
animals
she
had
to
leave
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
get
along
as
best
they
could
those
who
were
too
lazy
or
too
stupid
to
take
care
of
themselves
disappeared
and
others
took
their
places
there
was
nothing
lazy
or
stupid
about
bluebird
and
he
quickly
learned
how
to
take
care
of
himself
and
at
the
same
time
to
keep
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
neighbors
when
the
place
where
the
first
birds
lived
became
too
crowded
and
old
king
eagle
led
them
out
into
the
new
land
old
mother
nature
had
been
preparing
for
them
bluebird
was
one
of
the
first
to
follow
him
the
new
land
was
very
beautiful
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
and
plenty
to
eat
for
all
then
came
jack
frost
with
snow
and
ice
and
drove
all
the
birds
back
to
the
place
they
had
come
from
they
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
stay
there
even
if
it
were
crowded
but
after
a
while
old
mother
nature
came
to
tell
them
that
soon
jack
frost
would
be
driven
back
from
that
wonderful
new
land
and
sweet
mistress
spring
would
waken
all
the
sleeping
plants
and
all
the
sleeping
insects
up
there
so
that
it
would
be
as
beautiful
as
it
was
before
even
more
beautiful
than
the
place
where
they
were
now
she
said
that
she
should
expect
them
to
go
to
the
new
land
and
make
it
joyous
with
their
songs
and
build
their
homes
there
and
help
her
to
keep
the
insects
and
worms
from
eating
all
the
green
things
first
i
want
a
herald
to
go
before
mistress
spring
to
tell
those
who
have
lived
there
all
through
the
time
of
snow
and
ice
that
mistress
spring
is
coming
who
will
go
as
the
herald
of
sweet
mistress
spring
asked
old
mother
nature
all
the
birds
looked
at
one
another
and
shivered
and
then
one
by
one
they
tried
to
slip
out
of
sight
now
bluebird
had
modestly
waited
for
some
of
his
big
strong
neighbors
to
offer
to
take
the
message
of
gladness
up
into
that
frozen
land
but
when
he
saw
them
slip
away
one
by
one
his
heart
grew
hot
with
shame
for
them
and
he
flew
out
before
old
mother
nature
go
said
he
bobbing
his
head
respectfully
old
mother
nature
just
had
to
smile
because
compared
with
some
of
his
neighbors
bluebird
was
so
very
small
can
such
a
little
fellow
as
you
do
she
asked
will
freeze
to
death
up
there
for
it
is
still
very
cold
you
please
i
can
at
least
try
replied
bluebird
modestly
i
find
i
ca
go
on
i
can
come
back
what
reward
do
you
expect
asked
old
mother
nature
joy
of
spreading
such
good
news
as
the
coming
of
mistress
spring
will
be
all
the
reward
i
want
replied
bluebird
this
reply
so
pleased
old
mother
nature
that
she
then
and
there
made
bluebird
the
herald
of
mistress
spring
and
started
him
on
his
long
journey
it
a
long
journey
and
a
hard
journey
harder
very
much
harder
for
bluebird
than
the
same
journey
is
for
winsome
these
days
you
see
everything
was
new
to
him
and
then
it
was
so
cold
he
get
used
to
the
cold
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
he
certainly
would
freeze
to
death
at
these
times
when
he
sat
shivering
and
shaking
he
would
remember
that
sweet
mistress
spring
was
not
very
far
behind
and
that
he
was
her
herald
this
would
give
him
courage
and
he
would
bravely
keep
on
whenever
he
stopped
to
rest
he
would
whistle
the
news
that
mistress
spring
was
coming
and
sometimes
just
to
keep
up
his
own
courage
he
would
whistle
while
he
was
flying
and
he
found
it
helped
to
keep
warm
at
night
he
crept
into
hollow
trees
and
it
was
thus
he
learned
how
snug
and
safe
and
comfortable
such
places
were
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
in
just
such
a
place
he
would
build
his
nest
when
the
time
came
as
he
passed
on
he
left
behind
him
great
joy
and
mistress
spring
found
as
she
journeyed
north
that
all
in
the
forests
and
on
the
meadows
were
eagerly
awaiting
her
for
they
had
heard
the
message
of
her
coming
and
she
was
glad
and
told
old
mother
nature
how
well
her
herald
had
done
his
work
when
he
had
completed
his
errand
bluebird
built
a
home
and
was
as
modest
and
retiring
as
ever
he
did
seem
to
think
that
he
had
done
anything
out
of
the
usual
he
simply
rejoiced
in
his
heart
that
he
had
been
able
to
do
what
old
mother
nature
had
requested
and
it
never
entered
his
head
that
he
should
have
any
other
reward
than
the
knowledge
that
he
had
done
his
best
and
that
he
had
brought
cheer
and
hope
to
many
when
jack
frost
moved
down
from
the
far
north
in
the
fall
all
the
birds
journeyed
south
again
and
of
course
bluebird
went
with
them
the
next
season
when
it
was
time
for
mistress
spring
to
start
north
old
mother
nature
assembled
all
the
birds
and
this
time
instead
of
asking
who
would
carry
the
message
she
called
bluebird
out
before
them
and
asked
if
he
were
willing
to
be
the
herald
once
more
bluebird
said
that
he
would
be
glad
to
be
the
herald
if
she
wished
it
then
old
mother
nature
told
all
the
birds
how
brave
bluebird
was
and
how
faithful
and
true
and
she
made
all
the
other
birds
feel
ashamed
especially
those
bigger
and
stronger
than
bluebird
then
she
said
bluebird
for
that
is
to
be
your
name
from
now
on
i
here
and
now
appoint
you
the
herald
of
mistress
spring
and
the
honor
shall
descend
to
your
children
and
your
children
children
forever
and
ever
and
you
shall
be
one
of
the
most
loved
of
all
the
birds
and
because
you
are
a
herald
you
shall
have
a
bright
coat
as
all
heralds
should
have
and
because
you
are
true
and
faithful
your
coat
shall
be
blue
as
blue
as
the
blue
of
the
sky
she
reached
out
and
touched
bluebird
and
sure
enough
his
sober
gray
coat
turned
the
most
wonderful
blue
then
once
more
he
started
on
his
long
journey
and
he
whistled
his
message
more
joyously
than
before
and
because
his
whistle
brought
joy
and
gladness
and
because
he
was
beautiful
to
see
it
came
about
just
as
old
mother
nature
had
said
it
would
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
loved
of
all
the
birds
even
as
his
is
peter
drew
a
long
breath
thank
you
grandfather
frog
said
he
i
have
always
loved
winsome
bluebird
and
now
i
shall
love
him
ii
when
old
gopher
first
got
pockets
was
one
of
peter
rabbit
neighbors
of
whose
presence
he
was
always
aware
and
yet
whom
he
almost
never
saw
no
it
was
miner
the
mole
but
it
was
one
who
lives
in
much
the
same
way
as
miner
when
peter
would
leave
the
dear
old
he
seldom
went
far
without
coming
to
a
little
pile
of
fresh
earth
these
little
piles
of
earth
had
puzzled
peter
a
great
deal
for
a
long
time
it
sometimes
seemed
to
peter
as
if
they
appeared
by
magic
he
would
pass
across
a
certain
part
of
the
green
meadows
and
there
would
be
nothing
but
the
green
things
growing
there
when
he
returned
the
same
way
there
would
be
one
or
two
or
maybe
half
a
dozen
piles
of
newly
turned
earth
of
course
said
peter
the
first
time
he
noticed
one
of
these
little
earth
piles
where
there
is
a
pile
of
earth
like
that
there
must
be
a
hole
some
one
has
been
digging
and
this
is
the
dirt
thrown
but
when
peter
looked
for
the
hole
he
could
find
one
there
was
no
hole
it
was
very
puzzling
but
it
was
a
fact
he
kicked
that
pile
of
earth
until
he
had
scattered
it
far
and
wide
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
hole
later
he
tried
the
same
thing
with
other
little
piles
of
earth
but
never
once
did
he
find
a
hole
it
looked
as
if
some
one
brought
those
little
piles
dropped
them
on
the
green
meadows
and
then
went
away
of
course
no
one
did
anything
of
the
kind
and
peter
knew
it
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
wondering
who
could
make
them
then
one
day
as
he
was
hopping
along
across
the
green
meadows
the
ground
right
in
front
of
him
began
to
move
it
so
startled
peter
that
his
first
thought
was
to
run
then
he
decided
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
run
until
there
was
something
to
run
from
so
he
sat
perfectly
still
and
watched
that
spot
where
the
ground
was
moving
earth
loose
earth
was
pushed
up
from
underneath
and
even
as
peter
sat
there
staring
with
eyes
popping
out
of
his
head
and
mouth
wide
open
in
wonder
the
pile
grew
and
grew
until
it
was
as
big
as
any
of
the
piles
about
which
he
so
often
had
wondered
then
suddenly
a
head
was
thrust
out
of
the
middle
of
it
a
homely
head
in
an
instant
it
vanished
and
a
second
later
the
hole
where
it
had
been
was
filled
peter
could
hear
the
stranger
packing
the
earth
in
from
underneath
when
peter
had
recovered
his
breath
and
looked
there
was
no
sign
of
the
hole
no
one
would
ever
have
guessed
that
there
had
been
one
there
that
was
peter
rabbit
first
meeting
with
grubby
gopher
since
then
he
has
seen
grubby
several
times
but
grubby
is
never
what
you
would
call
neighborly
and
peter
never
has
felt
and
never
will
feel
really
acquainted
with
him
but
for
one
thing
peter
would
have
thought
grubby
gopher
the
most
uninteresting
fellow
he
ever
had
met
the
one
thing
was
the
discovery
that
grubby
has
the
biggest
pockets
in
his
cheeks
that
peter
has
ever
seen
and
another
thing
about
those
pockets
they
are
on
the
of
grubby
cheeks
instead
of
being
inside
as
is
the
case
with
striped
chipmunk
when
peter
discovered
this
he
became
curious
at
once
of
course
who
would
be
curious
peter
felt
sure
that
there
must
be
a
story
in
connection
with
those
pockets
he
wondered
what
use
grubby
gopher
had
for
pockets
anyway
he
wondered
why
they
were
outside
instead
of
inside
his
cheeks
he
wondered
a
great
many
things
did
peter
and
when
he
just
could
stand
it
any
longer
for
wondering
he
began
to
ask
questions
why
does
grubby
gopher
have
pockets
in
his
cheeks
he
asked
jimmy
skunk
because
they
are
handier
there
than
they
would
be
anywhere
else
replied
jimmy
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
have
you
seen
any
fat
beetles
this
morning
peter
no
returned
peter
shortly
then
an
idea
came
to
him
i
tell
you
what
jimmy
said
he
speaking
eagerly
if
you
tell
me
about
those
queer
pockets
of
grubby
and
how
he
came
by
them
i
help
you
hunt
for
some
beetles
is
it
a
bargain
jimmy
skunk
scratched
his
nose
thoughtfully
as
if
trying
to
decide
which
would
have
the
better
of
the
bargain
then
he
grinned
you
know
jimmy
really
is
one
of
the
little
people
in
the
world
all
right
said
he
it
a
bargain
you
do
your
part
and
do
mine
now
where
shall
i
begin
begin
with
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
of
course
replied
peter
all
good
stories
seem
to
have
had
their
beginnings
then
so
far
as
i
can
see
of
course
grubby
got
those
pockets
from
his
father
and
his
father
got
them
from
his
father
and
so
on
way
back
to
the
first
gopher
so
begin
right
off
with
just
as
you
say
replied
jimmy
old
gopher
the
first
gopher
who
was
old
then
was
one
of
the
little
people
whom
old
mother
nature
turned
loose
in
the
great
world
which
was
just
in
its
beginning
and
told
to
make
the
best
of
life
as
they
found
it
no
doubt
they
would
need
things
which
they
had
got
but
first
they
must
find
out
what
they
really
did
need
later
when
she
had
more
time
she
would
consider
these
needs
and
if
they
were
real
needs
not
just
desires
she
would
see
what
could
be
done
to
supply
them
so
gopher
started
out
to
make
his
way
in
the
great
world
and
it
was
long
before
he
discovered
that
everybody
else
was
doing
the
same
thing
it
soon
became
clear
to
him
that
if
everybody
lived
on
the
same
kind
of
food
there
would
be
enough
to
go
around
and
the
biggest
and
strongest
creatures
would
get
all
there
was
leaving
the
smaller
and
weaker
ones
to
starve
not
long
after
this
he
discovered
certain
of
his
big
neighbors
had
begun
to
look
at
him
in
a
way
that
made
him
most
uncomfortable
in
fact
they
looked
at
him
with
such
a
hungry
gleam
in
their
eyes
and
they
licked
their
lips
in
such
an
unpleasant
way
whenever
he
met
them
that
little
cold
shivers
ran
all
over
him
and
he
decided
that
the
less
he
was
seen
the
better
his
chances
one
other
thing
gopher
discovered
and
this
was
that
each
one
seemed
to
have
some
special
gift
one
was
a
good
climber
another
a
swift
runner
a
third
a
wonderful
jumper
a
fourth
a
great
swimmer
gopher
could
neither
climb
nor
run
nor
jump
nor
swim
particularly
well
what
could
he
do
somehow
he
had
a
feeling
that
old
mother
nature
had
given
him
some
special
advantage
what
could
it
be
he
sat
down
and
studied
himself
then
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
hands
were
different
from
the
hands
of
those
about
him
for
his
size
they
were
very
large
and
strong
and
on
the
three
middle
fingers
of
each
hand
were
long
stout
claws
what
could
he
do
with
these
besides
fight
dig
that
was
it
he
could
dig
he
tried
it
sure
enough
he
could
dig
at
a
surprising
rate
then
came
a
new
idea
he
would
dig
himself
a
hole
and
live
in
it
that
would
keep
him
out
of
sight
of
his
big
neighbors
with
the
eyes
and
the
watery
mouths
so
he
dug
himself
a
hole
and
then
he
discovered
that
in
order
to
get
food
he
must
leave
the
hole
and
so
he
was
no
better
off
than
before
while
he
was
studying
over
this
he
started
a
little
tunnel
just
for
the
fun
of
digging
for
he
liked
to
dig
did
gopher
presently
he
came
to
a
root
in
his
path
he
decided
to
cut
it
and
get
it
out
of
his
way
now
when
he
began
to
cut
it
he
made
another
discovery
one
that
tickled
him
half
to
death
that
root
was
good
to
eat
he
ate
all
of
it
and
then
he
went
on
digging
hoping
to
find
another
he
did
find
another
then
gopher
made
up
his
mind
that
in
the
future
he
would
live
underground
and
be
safe
he
would
make
himself
a
comfortable
house
and
then
from
that
he
would
tunnel
wherever
he
pleased
for
food
so
gopher
made
a
comfortable
house
underground
and
then
he
started
digging
for
food
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
make
an
opening
at
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
push
out
the
dirt
he
had
dug
in
making
his
tunnel
filling
up
the
opening
as
soon
as
he
had
pushed
out
all
the
dirt
in
this
way
he
kept
his
tunnels
clear
so
that
he
could
run
back
and
forth
through
them
so
he
lived
very
comfortably
until
one
day
he
happened
to
overhear
squirrel
talking
about
the
coming
of
jack
frost
and
telling
how
he
would
mind
because
he
was
laying
up
stores
of
food
in
a
storehouse
a
good
idea
of
squirrel
thought
gopher
who
was
much
troubled
by
what
he
had
heard
about
the
coming
of
jack
frost
believe
i
do
the
same
thing
but
when
he
tried
it
he
found
it
slow
hard
work
you
see
he
could
carry
so
little
at
a
time
and
had
to
carry
it
so
far
that
it
was
very
discouraging
he
had
forgotten
all
about
old
mother
nature
until
suddenly
one
day
she
appeared
before
him
and
smilingly
asked
what
boon
she
could
grant
him
almost
without
thinking
he
replied
big
pockets
in
my
cheeks
old
mother
nature
looked
surprised
me
all
about
it
said
she
do
you
want
pockets
and
what
would
you
do
with
them
if
you
had
them
so
gopher
explained
to
old
mother
nature
how
he
had
learned
to
live
underground
and
how
lately
he
had
been
trying
to
lay
up
a
store
of
food
but
had
found
it
slow
work
old
mother
nature
was
pleased
to
think
that
gopher
had
made
the
most
of
his
opportunities
but
she
did
say
so
think
it
over
said
she
and
left
him
but
the
very
next
time
gopher
brushed
a
hand
against
one
of
his
cheeks
he
discovered
a
great
pocket
there
hastily
he
felt
of
the
other
there
was
another
great
pocket
there
then
gopher
was
perfectly
happy
he
felt
that
there
was
a
single
thing
in
all
the
world
that
he
could
ask
for
to
make
him
any
happier
it
is
just
the
same
way
with
grubby
he
is
perfectly
happy
working
in
the
dark
under
the
ground
and
very
very
proud
of
the
big
pockets
in
his
cheeks
concluded
jimmy
skunk
thank
you
jimmy
thank
you
ever
so
much
now
i
help
you
find
some
fat
beetles
cried
peter
iii
when
old
grouse
got
his
snowshoes
rabbit
and
grouse
are
very
good
friends
in
fact
they
are
the
best
of
friends
for
one
thing
they
are
very
near
neighbors
once
in
a
great
while
grouse
comes
to
the
dear
old
and
walks
along
peter
private
little
paths
however
that
is
often
but
up
in
the
bramble
tangle
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
they
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
together
you
see
they
both
fear
the
same
enemies
and
so
they
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
over
and
each
is
always
ready
to
help
the
other
when
winter
comes
peter
is
sometimes
rather
lonely
you
see
a
lot
of
his
feathered
friends
fly
away
to
the
warm
sunny
southland
to
spend
the
winter
other
friends
johnny
chuck
and
striped
chipmunk
and
grandfather
frog
for
instance
retire
and
sleep
all
through
the
cold
weather
peter
can
not
understand
what
they
do
it
for
but
they
do
so
peter
has
very
few
to
gossip
with
after
jack
frost
arrives
but
he
can
always
count
on
grouse
no
matter
how
hard
jack
frost
pinches
or
how
bitter
the
breath
of
rough
brother
north
wind
somewhere
in
the
green
forest
grouse
is
bravely
doing
her
best
to
get
enough
to
eat
and
peter
knows
that
if
he
looks
for
her
he
will
find
her
there
was
one
thing
about
grouse
that
puzzled
peter
for
a
long
time
and
this
was
the
difference
between
the
footprints
she
made
in
the
soft
damp
earth
after
a
rain
in
the
summer
and
the
prints
she
made
in
the
snow
the
first
time
he
noticed
those
prints
in
the
snow
he
actually
did
know
who
had
made
them
you
know
how
very
very
curious
peter
is
he
followed
those
queer
footprints
and
when
he
found
that
they
led
right
straight
into
the
bramble
tangle
he
just
did
know
what
to
think
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bramble
tangle
and
scratched
his
long
right
ear
with
his
long
left
hind
foot
when
peter
does
this
it
is
a
sign
that
he
is
very
much
puzzled
about
something
good
morning
peter
rabbit
you
seem
to
have
something
on
your
mind
said
a
voice
from
the
middle
of
the
bramble
tangle
peter
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
then
he
hopped
into
the
bramble
tangle
along
one
of
the
little
paths
he
had
cut
there
good
morning
grouse
he
replied
i
got
something
on
my
mind
i
have
been
following
some
strange
tracks
and
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
he
pointed
at
one
of
them
as
he
spoke
oh
replied
grouse
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
i
made
those
with
my
snowshoes
i
supposed
you
snowshoes
what
are
asked
peter
looking
more
puzzled
than
ever
very
proudly
grouse
held
out
one
foot
for
peter
to
look
at
instead
of
the
slim
smooth
toes
he
often
had
admired
peter
saw
that
the
bottom
of
each
was
covered
for
its
whole
length
with
horny
little
points
that
prevented
the
foot
from
sinking
way
down
in
the
snow
as
it
would
have
done
without
them
this
made
it
very
easy
for
grouse
to
get
about
on
the
snow
instead
of
having
to
wade
through
it
my
exclaimed
peter
how
perfectly
splendid
where
did
you
get
them
oh
replied
grouse
with
pride
in
her
voice
they
have
been
in
the
family
a
great
many
years
they
were
given
to
my
by
old
mother
tell
me
about
it
do
please
tell
me
about
it
begged
peter
who
had
not
had
a
story
since
grandfather
frog
went
to
sleep
for
the
winter
grouse
fluffed
out
her
feathers
and
settled
herself
comfortably
there
is
much
to
tell
she
began
but
all
the
same
our
family
always
has
been
rather
proud
of
the
way
we
came
by
our
snowshoes
it
all
happened
a
great
while
way
back
in
the
time
that
grandfather
frog
tells
about
when
the
world
was
young
interrupted
peter
grouse
nodded
and
went
on
grouse
lived
very
comfortably
in
those
days
even
when
the
hard
times
came
and
so
many
took
to
killing
their
neighbors
because
food
was
scarce
he
always
managed
to
get
enough
to
eat
because
he
did
believe
in
being
fussy
when
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
he
took
what
he
could
get
and
was
thankful
when
he
could
find
grasshoppers
or
crickets
or
bugs
of
any
kind
or
chestnuts
or
beechnuts
or
berries
that
he
liked
he
ate
such
berries
as
he
could
find
whether
he
liked
them
or
not
and
when
he
could
find
berries
or
seeds
he
ate
the
buds
of
trees
so
one
way
or
another
he
managed
to
pick
up
a
living
and
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
his
enemies
for
he
was
just
as
smart
as
they
were
you
know
in
those
days
there
were
no
hunters
with
dreadful
guns
so
grandfather
grouse
managed
to
get
along
without
really
suffering
until
the
coming
of
the
first
snow
that
first
snow
was
hard
on
everybody
but
it
was
particularly
hard
on
grandfather
grouse
his
slim
toes
cut
right
through
they
would
hold
him
up
at
all
of
course
he
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
up
in
the
trees
but
when
he
wanted
to
get
berries
on
the
bushes
the
kind
that
stay
on
all
winter
you
know
he
just
had
to
stand
on
the
ground
and
reach
up
for
them
then
too
his
feet
were
intended
for
walking
and
running
rather
than
for
perching
in
trees
and
it
made
his
toes
ache
dreadfully
to
have
to
cling
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
too
long
i
know
just
how
it
felt
because
i
have
had
to
do
it
when
reddy
fox
has
been
hunting
for
me
but
grandfather
grouse
made
the
best
of
a
bad
matter
and
did
say
a
word
not
a
word
he
waded
around
in
the
snow
as
best
he
could
but
it
was
dreadfully
tiresome
he
could
take
more
than
a
few
steps
without
stopping
to
rest
and
this
was
all
the
snow
made
his
feet
ache
with
the
cold
he
had
to
keep
drawing
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
up
to
warm
them
in
his
feathers
now
grandfather
grouse
had
sharp
eyes
and
he
knew
how
to
use
them
he
had
to
to
keep
out
of
danger
he
watched
the
other
little
people
and
he
soon
saw
that
those
with
big
feet
feet
that
were
big
for
the
size
of
their
bodies
did
sink
in
like
those
with
small
slim
feet
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
began
to
wish
that
old
mother
nature
had
made
him
different
he
wished
that
he
had
broad
feet
yes
sir
he
wished
just
that
then
a
thought
popped
into
his
head
perhaps
the
snow
going
to
last
forever
perhaps
it
would
go
away
and
never
come
again
then
he
would
want
broad
feet
but
just
the
kind
of
feet
he
already
had
he
sighed
then
he
tried
to
smile
bravely
guess
said
he
talking
out
loud
to
himself
for
he
thought
he
was
quite
alone
guess
the
thing
to
do
is
to
stop
worrying
about
the
things
i
have
got
and
make
the
most
of
the
blessings
i
have
got
and
he
started
to
wade
through
the
snow
for
some
berries
just
ahead
now
old
mother
nature
happened
to
be
passing
and
she
overheard
grandfather
grouse
wish
that
every
one
felt
as
you
do
said
she
would
make
things
a
great
deal
easier
for
me
but
what
is
it
that
you
wish
you
had
grandfather
grouse
felt
both
pleased
and
a
little
ashamed
ashamed
that
he
should
even
to
be
dissatisfied
at
first
he
tried
to
pretend
that
everything
really
was
all
right
but
after
a
little
urging
he
told
old
mother
nature
all
about
his
troubles
since
the
coming
of
the
snow
she
listened
and
looked
thoughtful
then
she
told
grandfather
grouse
to
be
patient
and
perhaps
things
would
not
be
so
bad
as
they
seemed
somehow
grandfather
grouse
felt
better
after
that
and
when
he
went
to
bed
for
the
night
in
a
big
he
was
almost
cheerful
the
next
morning
when
he
flew
down
to
get
his
breakfast
he
had
the
greatest
surprise
of
his
life
instead
of
sinking
way
down
into
the
snow
he
sank
hardly
at
all
he
could
get
about
with
the
greatest
ease
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
until
he
happened
to
look
down
at
his
feet
and
then
he
saw
that
he
had
snowshoes
interrupted
peter
rabbit
dancing
about
in
great
excitement
just
so
replied
grouse
he
had
snowshoes
just
like
the
ones
i
have
now
when
spring
came
old
mother
nature
came
around
and
took
them
away
because
he
no
longer
had
need
of
them
but
when
the
next
winter
came
she
returned
them
to
him
she
called
them
the
reward
of
patience
and
ever
since
that
day
our
family
has
had
snowshoes
in
the
winter
i
really
do
know
how
we
would
get
along
without
i
do
know
how
you
would
replied
peter
rabbit
is
it
splendid
how
old
mother
nature
seems
to
know
just
what
everybody
needs
and
with
that
peter
started
for
the
dear
old
to
tell
little
peter
all
about
the
snowshoes
of
grouse
iv
when
old
panther
lost
his
honor
rabbit
always
curious
had
overheard
his
cousin
jumper
the
hare
tell
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
that
it
was
lucky
for
him
puma
the
panther
was
too
much
afraid
of
men
to
come
down
to
the
green
forest
to
live
but
kept
to
the
great
woods
and
the
big
mountains
at
the
very
mention
of
puma
the
thousand
little
spears
of
prickly
porky
had
rattled
together
and
peter
had
a
queer
feeling
that
this
time
instead
of
being
rattled
purposely
to
make
others
afraid
they
rattled
because
prickly
porky
himself
shook
with
something
very
like
fear
in
fact
it
seemed
to
peter
that
prickly
porky
actually
turned
pale
now
peter
knew
nothing
at
all
about
puma
the
panther
and
right
away
he
was
so
full
of
questions
that
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
jumper
alone
so
that
he
might
satisfy
his
curiosity
the
first
chance
he
got
he
began
to
ask
questions
so
fast
that
jumper
clapped
his
hands
over
both
ears
and
threatened
to
run
away
who
is
puma
where
does
he
live
why
is
prickly
porky
afraid
of
him
what
does
he
look
like
why
it
was
then
that
jumper
clapped
his
hands
over
his
ears
peter
grinned
please
cousin
jumper
tell
me
about
him
he
begged
jumper
pretended
to
consider
for
a
few
minutes
then
because
like
most
people
he
likes
to
air
his
knowledge
and
also
because
he
is
very
fond
of
his
cousin
peter
he
told
him
what
he
knew
about
puma
the
panther
in
the
first
place
said
he
puma
is
the
biggest
member
of
the
cat
family
living
in
the
great
is
he
bigger
than
tuffy
the
lynx
asked
peter
eagerly
jumper
nodded
and
peter
eyes
opened
very
wide
he
looks
very
much
like
black
pussy
farmer
brown
cat
only
he
is
instead
of
black
and
is
ever
and
ever
and
ever
so
many
times
bigger
continued
jumper
he
has
a
long
tail
just
like
black
pussy
and
great
claws
which
are
terribly
sharp
he
is
so
that
he
can
steal
through
the
woods
without
making
a
sound
he
can
climb
trees
like
happy
jack
squirrel
and
he
is
so
big
and
strong
that
every
one
but
buster
bear
is
afraid
of
him
even
prickly
porky
for
he
is
so
smart
and
cunning
that
he
has
found
a
way
to
make
prickly
porky
thousand
little
spears
quite
useless
to
protect
him
but
big
and
strong
and
smart
as
he
is
he
is
a
coward
because
he
is
a
sneak
and
all
sneaks
are
cowards
of
course
you
know
that
peter
nodded
everybody
knows
that
said
he
but
if
he
is
so
big
and
strong
and
smart
why
is
he
a
sneak
i
guess
it
in
his
blood
and
he
ca
help
himself
replied
jumper
i
guess
it
is
because
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
his
lost
his
honor
and
none
of
the
family
ever
has
got
it
back
how
did
old
panther
lose
his
honor
demanded
peter
fairly
itching
with
curiosity
and
eagerness
well
replied
jumper
all
i
know
is
what
i
heard
whispered
about
among
the
people
of
the
great
woods
it
may
be
true
and
it
may
not
be
but
every
one
seems
to
believe
it
as
i
said
before
it
happened
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
old
king
bear
ruled
the
great
woods
then
and
there
was
peace
between
all
the
animals
panther
was
sleek
and
handsome
and
graceful
in
all
his
movements
he
knew
it
too
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
washing
himself
and
smoothing
his
fur
just
as
black
pussy
does
he
would
stretch
out
in
the
sun
for
hours
with
his
eyes
closed
until
they
were
just
slits
but
all
the
time
he
saw
all
that
was
going
on
around
him
he
would
watch
old
king
bear
shuffling
about
in
his
clumsy
fashion
and
he
would
curl
the
end
of
his
tail
up
and
twitch
it
scornfully
then
he
would
look
at
his
own
trim
form
admiringly
and
think
how
much
a
king
he
would
make
the
more
he
watched
old
king
bear
the
more
this
feeling
grew
he
became
envious
and
then
jealous
but
he
took
care
never
to
let
old
king
bear
know
this
you
see
there
was
one
thing
about
king
bear
which
panther
did
respect
and
that
was
his
strength
he
had
no
desire
to
quarrel
with
king
bear
so
whenever
they
met
he
was
very
polite
and
said
flattering
things
to
him
but
behind
his
back
panther
made
fun
of
him
but
did
it
in
such
an
artful
way
that
his
neighbors
merely
thought
that
they
themselves
were
making
the
discovery
of
how
much
handsomer
panther
was
than
old
king
bear
after
a
while
came
the
hard
time
when
food
was
scarce
and
in
order
to
keep
from
starving
the
big
and
strong
began
to
prey
on
their
neighbors
who
were
smaller
or
weaker
or
more
helpless
but
the
law
was
made
that
none
should
kill
more
than
was
needed
to
fill
an
empty
stomach
for
the
time
being
it
was
then
that
panther
thought
of
a
plan
for
making
old
king
bear
hated
by
all
his
subjects
they
hate
him
they
will
refuse
to
have
him
as
king
any
longer
and
i
being
next
in
strength
and
far
more
kingly
in
appearance
will
be
made
king
in
his
place
reasoned
panther
but
he
took
care
not
to
hint
such
a
thing
presently
ugly
stories
began
to
float
about
some
one
was
killing
seemingly
for
the
fun
of
killing
it
was
dreadful
but
it
was
true
almost
every
day
some
one
was
found
killed
but
not
eaten
and
always
there
were
footprints
going
to
and
away
from
the
place
and
they
were
the
footprints
of
king
bear
so
all
the
forest
people
began
to
hate
king
bear
and
to
mutter
among
themselves
that
they
would
have
him
for
king
no
longer
finally
some
of
them
went
to
old
mother
nature
and
told
her
all
about
it
they
asked
that
old
king
bear
be
punished
and
that
some
one
else
be
made
king
in
his
place
old
mother
nature
told
them
that
she
would
think
it
over
quite
unknown
to
old
king
bear
she
followed
him
about
and
watched
him
as
he
shuffled
about
in
his
clumsy
way
it
ought
not
to
be
very
hard
to
keep
out
of
his
way
those
who
are
caught
must
be
very
stupid
if
catches
them
thought
she
presently
her
sharp
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
shadowy
form
sneaking
along
behind
old
king
bear
it
was
panther
and
he
was
stepping
with
the
greatest
care
so
as
to
leave
no
footprints
old
mother
nature
sat
down
and
waited
she
saw
panther
bound
away
through
the
trees
by
and
by
he
came
back
bringing
the
body
of
a
hare
which
he
had
killed
he
laid
it
down
where
old
king
bear
had
left
a
footprint
in
the
soft
earth
and
then
with
his
long
tail
twitching
he
looked
this
way
and
that
way
to
make
sure
that
no
one
had
seen
him
and
then
bounded
away
the
next
day
old
mother
nature
called
all
the
people
of
the
forest
before
her
and
they
all
came
for
none
dared
stay
away
when
they
were
all
there
she
had
each
in
turn
look
her
straight
in
the
face
while
she
asked
if
they
had
hunted
fairly
and
honorably
and
only
when
they
were
hungry
each
in
turn
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
and
said
that
he
had
until
it
came
the
turn
of
panther
panther
tail
twitched
nervously
and
he
looked
everywhere
but
at
old
mother
nature
as
she
put
the
question
to
him
me
straight
in
the
face
and
tell
me
on
your
honor
that
you
have
hunted
fairly
commanded
old
mother
nature
panther
knew
that
all
eyes
were
upon
him
and
he
tried
his
best
to
look
her
in
the
face
but
he
could
do
it
you
see
he
had
any
honor
he
had
lost
it
and
without
honor
no
one
can
look
another
straight
in
the
face
instead
he
turned
and
began
to
slink
away
and
all
who
saw
him
wondered
how
they
ever
could
have
thought
him
then
old
mother
nature
told
what
she
had
seen
the
day
before
and
at
once
everybody
understood
who
it
was
that
had
been
doing
the
killing
and
trying
to
make
it
appear
that
it
was
old
king
bear
and
they
all
turned
and
shouted
sneak
coward
sneak
until
panther
fairly
ran
to
get
out
of
hearing
from
that
time
on
he
lived
by
himself
and
would
not
look
even
timid
hare
in
the
face
instead
of
hunting
openly
and
boldly
like
wolf
he
sneaked
about
in
the
forest
and
hunted
by
stealth
so
that
all
the
people
of
the
forest
looked
on
him
with
scorn
and
though
most
of
them
feared
him
they
called
him
a
coward
and
they
nicknamed
him
and
to
this
day
all
panthers
have
been
the
same
sneaking
and
cowardly
in
spite
of
their
great
size
and
strength
for
it
has
been
in
their
blood
ever
since
the
time
when
old
panther
lost
his
honor
ended
jumper
peter
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
he
said
softly
i
little
and
timid
but
i
rather
be
that
way
than
to
be
big
like
puma
but
a
coward
and
a
sneak
i
can
look
any
one
in
the
when
old
rat
became
an
outcast
the
brown
rat
is
an
outcast
among
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
you
know
an
outcast
is
one
with
whom
no
one
else
will
have
anything
to
do
no
one
speaks
to
robber
whoever
meets
him
pretends
not
to
even
see
him
unless
it
happens
to
be
one
of
the
hawk
family
or
one
of
the
owl
family
or
shadow
the
weasel
if
one
of
these
sees
him
it
is
well
for
robber
to
find
a
safe
without
any
loss
of
time
but
the
rest
of
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
turn
their
backs
on
robber
and
get
out
of
his
way
partly
because
many
of
them
are
afraid
of
him
and
partly
because
they
despise
him
and
consider
him
quite
beneath
them
he
has
a
single
friend
among
them
not
even
among
his
own
relatives
the
latter
are
ashamed
of
him
if
they
could
help
it
they
would
even
admit
that
they
are
related
to
him
just
mention
him
to
them
and
right
away
they
will
begin
to
talk
about
something
else
wag
the
wood
rat
and
bounder
the
kangeroo
rat
are
very
different
fellows
and
are
well
liked
but
robber
the
brown
rat
is
hated
yes
sir
he
is
hated
even
by
his
own
relatives
which
you
will
agree
is
a
dreadful
state
of
affairs
peter
rabbit
had
heard
of
robber
but
never
had
seen
him
until
one
moonlight
night
he
happened
to
go
up
to
farmer
brown
barn
just
out
of
curiosity
he
saw
a
hole
under
the
barn
and
was
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
go
in
and
find
out
what
was
inside
when
who
should
come
out
but
robber
himself
his
coat
was
so
rough
and
untidy
he
was
so
dirty
he
smelled
so
unclean
and
he
looked
so
savage
that
peter
at
once
decided
that
he
was
interested
in
that
barn
and
took
himself
off
to
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
he
could
go
all
the
rest
of
the
night
he
thought
about
robber
the
brown
rat
and
the
very
next
day
he
hurried
over
to
the
smiling
pool
to
ask
grandfather
frog
how
it
was
that
robber
had
become
such
a
disreputable
fellow
with
not
a
single
friend
grandfather
frog
had
had
a
good
breakfast
of
foolish
green
flies
and
was
feeling
in
the
very
best
of
humor
said
he
robber
the
brown
rat
is
an
outcast
because
he
is
all
bad
his
father
was
all
bad
and
his
father
father
and
so
on
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
when
the
world
was
young
there
was
no
good
in
any
of
them
and
there
is
no
good
in
robber
he
is
a
disgrace
to
the
whole
race
of
meadow
and
forest
people
and
so
he
lives
only
where
man
lives
and
i
have
heard
that
he
is
as
much
hated
by
man
as
by
the
rest
of
us
way
back
when
the
world
was
young
his
who
was
the
first
of
his
race
lived
with
the
rest
of
the
little
people
in
the
green
forest
and
old
mother
nature
gave
him
the
same
chance
to
make
an
honest
living
that
she
gave
to
the
rest
for
a
while
rat
was
honest
he
was
honest
just
as
long
as
it
was
easier
to
be
honest
than
dishonest
but
when
the
hard
times
came
of
which
you
know
and
food
became
scarce
rat
was
too
lazy
to
even
try
to
earn
his
own
living
he
discovered
that
it
was
easier
to
steal
from
his
neighbors
he
was
at
all
particular
whom
he
stole
from
but
he
took
from
big
and
little
alike
he
was
so
sly
about
it
that
for
a
long
time
no
one
found
him
out
by
and
by
his
neighbors
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
rat
always
seemed
fat
and
well
fed
and
yet
never
was
seen
to
work
but
rat
was
too
crafty
to
be
caught
stealing
he
said
he
did
need
much
to
live
on
which
was
an
untruth
for
he
was
a
very
greedy
fellow
now
laziness
is
a
habit
that
grows
first
rat
was
too
lazy
to
work
for
his
living
then
little
by
little
he
grew
too
lazy
to
be
crafty
he
grew
bolder
and
bolder
in
his
stealing
until
at
last
he
just
took
what
he
pleased
from
those
who
were
smaller
than
he
being
well
fed
he
was
strong
all
the
little
people
of
his
own
size
and
smaller
feared
him
the
bigger
people
said
it
was
no
business
of
theirs
so
long
as
he
did
steal
from
them
all
the
time
he
stealing
from
them
but
had
been
caught
finally
he
grew
too
lazy
to
keep
himself
looking
neat
his
coat
was
always
unbrushed
and
he
was
always
dirty
you
see
it
was
too
much
work
to
even
wash
his
face
and
hands
there
was
always
food
sticking
to
his
whiskers
the
little
people
kept
away
from
him
because
they
were
afraid
of
him
the
bigger
people
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
because
they
were
ashamed
of
him
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
his
company
illustration
so
lazy
rat
grew
dirtier
in
his
habits
bolder
in
his
stealing
and
impudent
to
everybody
he
became
quarrelsome
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
bigger
people
found
him
out
mr
lynx
had
secured
the
first
meal
he
had
had
in
a
week
part
of
it
he
put
away
for
the
next
day
before
going
to
bed
he
went
to
have
a
look
at
it
some
of
it
was
gone
queer
muttered
lynx
wonder
who
there
is
who
dares
to
steal
from
me
mr
lynx
hid
where
he
could
watch
what
was
left
of
that
meal
by
and
by
he
grew
sleepy
he
was
just
dozing
off
when
he
heard
a
noise
there
was
rat
carrying
off
part
of
what
was
left
of
that
meal
with
a
snarl
of
anger
lynx
leaped
out
but
rat
was
too
quick
for
him
he
slipped
into
a
hole
lynx
grabbed
at
him
and
caught
him
by
the
tail
rat
pulled
and
lynx
pulled
but
rat
tail
was
slippery
and
lynx
could
hold
on
he
did
however
pull
all
the
hair
from
it
of
course
lynx
told
what
had
happened
and
after
that
rat
did
not
dare
show
himself
at
all
when
the
bigger
people
were
about
so
he
lived
in
holes
and
continued
to
steal
finally
old
king
bear
called
a
meeting
and
it
was
decided
to
drive
rat
out
of
the
green
forest
and
off
the
green
meadows
little
weasel
said
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
rat
and
he
would
go
into
all
the
holes
and
drive
rat
out
so
weasel
went
into
hole
after
hole
until
at
last
he
found
rat
rat
tried
to
fight
but
he
found
that
little
weasel
was
so
slim
and
could
move
so
quickly
that
he
could
get
hold
of
him
so
at
last
rat
was
forced
to
run
to
save
his
life
the
minute
he
appeared
all
the
others
big
and
little
started
for
him
rat
gave
one
look
and
then
with
a
squeal
of
fright
he
ran
with
all
his
might
dodging
into
one
after
another
only
to
be
chased
out
of
each
and
so
at
last
he
turned
away
from
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
and
ran
to
the
homes
of
men
where
he
hid
in
dark
places
and
stole
from
men
as
he
formerly
had
stolen
from
his
neighbors
of
the
green
forest
and
because
men
are
wasteful
and
allow
much
food
to
spoil
rat
found
plenty
to
fill
his
stomach
such
as
it
was
but
often
it
was
such
as
no
one
else
would
have
touched
once
or
twice
he
tried
to
get
back
to
the
green
forest
but
as
soon
as
he
was
discovered
he
was
driven
back
and
at
last
he
gave
up
trying
he
grew
more
dirty
than
ever
and
finding
everybody
even
man
against
him
he
became
savage
of
temper
living
wholly
by
stealing
evil
to
look
at
and
evil
to
come
near
for
in
the
dirt
of
his
coat
be
carried
sickness
from
place
to
place
in
no
place
in
all
the
great
world
could
he
find
a
welcome
his
children
followed
in
his
footsteps
and
his
children
children
old
mother
nature
became
so
disgusted
with
them
that
she
said
that
they
should
always
remain
outcasts
until
they
should
mend
their
ways
but
this
they
never
did
and
so
robber
the
brown
rat
is
an
outcast
looked
down
on
and
hated
by
every
living
thing
there
is
none
to
say
a
good
word
for
him
and
to
this
day
the
tails
of
robber
family
have
been
almost
bare
of
hair
as
a
reminder
of
how
old
rat
of
long
ago
came
to
be
driven
out
of
the
green
forest
now
are
you
satisfied
peter
rabbit
concluded
grandfather
frog
yes
indeed
and
i
thank
you
ever
so
much
declared
peter
ugh
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
despised
and
hated
by
all
the
great
world
i
would
be
in
robber
place
for
i
should
hope
not
said
grandfather
frog
vi
when
moose
lost
his
horns
rabbit
had
just
seen
flathorns
the
moose
for
the
first
time
and
peter
was
having
hard
work
to
believe
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
eyes
indeed
they
looked
as
if
something
was
the
matter
with
them
for
they
seemed
about
to
pop
right
out
of
his
head
if
any
one
had
peter
that
any
one
as
big
as
flathorns
lived
in
the
great
woods
he
would
have
believed
it
but
now
that
he
had
that
it
was
so
he
just
had
to
believe
so
peter
sat
with
his
eyes
popping
out
and
his
mouth
gaping
wide
open
in
the
most
foolish
way
as
he
stared
in
the
direction
in
which
flathorns
had
gone
big
is
he
peter
looked
up
to
see
blacky
the
crow
in
the
top
of
a
just
at
one
side
and
blacky
too
was
looking
after
flathorns
then
blacky
looked
down
at
peter
and
began
to
laugh
do
try
to
swallow
him
peter
said
he
illustration
peter
closed
his
mouth
with
a
snap
my
but
he
big
he
exclaimed
i
never
felt
so
small
in
all
my
life
as
when
i
first
caught
sight
of
him
what
queer
horns
he
has
i
suppose
they
are
horns
for
he
carries
them
on
his
head
just
as
lightfoot
the
deer
does
his
they
are
so
big
i
should
think
they
would
make
his
head
perhaps
they
do
and
that
is
why
he
drops
them
every
spring
and
grows
a
new
pair
during
the
summer
replied
blacky
drops
them
drops
those
great
horns
and
grows
new
ones
in
a
single
summer
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
hard
things
like
those
horns
grow
and
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
he
drops
them
every
spring
why
i
saw
him
banging
them
against
a
tree
just
now
and
i
guess
if
they
ever
were
coming
off
they
would
have
come
off
then
you
ca
fool
me
with
any
such
story
as
that
blacky
have
it
your
own
way
peter
replied
blacky
some
people
never
can
believe
a
thing
until
they
see
it
with
their
own
eyes
all
i
got
to
say
is
just
keep
an
eye
on
flathorns
in
the
spring
and
then
remember
what
i
told
before
peter
could
reply
blacky
had
spread
his
wings
and
with
a
harsh
caw
caw
caw
had
flown
away
of
course
after
that
peter
was
very
very
curious
about
flathorns
the
moose
and
he
just
ached
all
over
to
ask
about
those
horns
but
every
time
he
saw
them
the
idea
that
they
ever
would
or
could
come
off
seemed
so
impossible
that
he
held
his
tongue
you
see
he
did
want
to
be
laughed
at
so
the
winter
passed
and
peter
was
no
wiser
than
before
then
the
spring
came
and
one
day
peter
was
hurrying
along
when
right
in
front
of
him
lay
something
that
made
him
stop
short
and
stare
even
harder
than
he
had
stared
the
first
time
he
saw
what
was
it
why
it
was
one
of
those
very
horns
he
had
thought
so
much
about
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
it
was
even
then
peter
could
believe
it
was
so
he
could
believe
it
until
he
had
hunted
up
flathorns
himself
and
seen
with
his
own
eyes
that
there
were
no
longer
any
horns
on
that
great
head
then
peter
to
believe
it
seemed
to
peter
the
strangest
thing
he
ever
had
heard
of
there
must
be
a
reason
and
if
there
were
grandfather
frog
would
be
sure
to
know
it
so
every
day
peter
visited
the
smiling
pool
to
see
if
grandfather
frog
had
wakened
from
his
long
winter
sleep
at
last
one
day
he
found
him
and
could
hardly
wait
to
tell
him
how
glad
he
was
to
see
him
once
more
and
to
be
properly
polite
before
he
asked
him
about
those
horns
of
the
moose
said
grandfather
frog
it
pretty
early
in
the
season
to
be
asking
me
for
a
story
but
seeing
it
is
you
peter
and
that
waited
all
winter
for
it
i
tell
it
to
you
way
way
back
in
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
the
first
moose
the
of
flathorns
was
the
biggest
of
all
the
animals
in
the
green
forest
but
he
had
no
horns
and
he
was
such
a
homely
fellow
that
everybody
laughed
at
him
and
made
fun
of
him
now
nothing
hurts
quite
so
much
as
being
laughed
i
know
interrupted
peter
mr
moose
felt
so
badly
about
it
that
he
used
to
hide
away
and
keep
out
of
sight
all
he
possibly
could
continued
grandfather
frog
big
as
he
was
and
strong
as
he
was
he
would
turn
and
run
away
to
hide
from
even
such
little
people
as
mr
skunk
and
squirrel
and
your
rabbit
he
just
could
bear
to
be
laughed
at
old
mother
nature
kept
her
eye
on
him
and
at
last
she
took
pity
on
him
and
crowned
his
head
with
the
most
wonderful
horns
horns
so
big
that
no
one
smaller
than
moose
could
possibly
have
carried
them
then
moose
threw
up
his
head
and
carried
it
proudly
for
now
no
one
laughed
at
him
he
marched
through
the
great
woods
boldly
and
even
old
king
bear
who
was
king
no
longer
stepped
aside
respectfully
then
pride
entered
into
moose
pride
in
his
wonderful
horns
pride
in
his
great
strength
he
feared
no
one
he
beat
the
bushes
with
his
great
horns
and
bellowed
until
the
great
woods
rang
with
his
voice
and
all
those
who
had
once
laughed
at
him
hid
in
fear
he
proclaimed
himself
king
of
the
great
woods
and
no
one
dared
to
deny
it
so
he
came
and
went
when
and
where
he
pleased
and
felt
himself
every
inch
a
king
and
carried
his
great
horns
as
a
crown
one
day
in
the
beginning
of
the
springtime
he
came
face
to
face
with
old
mother
nature
once
he
would
have
bowed
to
her
very
humbly
but
by
now
he
had
grown
so
proud
and
haughty
that
instead
of
stepping
aside
for
her
to
pass
he
boldly
marched
on
with
his
head
held
high
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
it
was
old
mother
nature
who
stepped
aside
she
said
nothing
but
as
he
passed
she
reached
forth
and
touched
his
great
horns
and
they
fell
from
his
head
and
with
them
fell
all
his
pride
and
haughtiness
at
once
some
of
his
neighbors
who
had
been
hiding
near
and
had
seen
all
that
had
happened
began
to
mock
him
and
make
fun
of
him
and
laugh
at
him
then
with
his
head
hung
low
in
shame
did
moose
slink
away
and
hide
as
he
had
done
in
the
beginning
and
none
could
find
him
save
old
mother
nature
very
humble
was
moose
when
she
visited
him
all
his
pride
was
melted
away
in
shame
old
mother
nature
was
sorry
for
him
she
promised
him
that
he
should
have
new
horns
but
that
once
a
year
he
should
lose
his
horns
lest
he
should
forget
and
again
become
and
haughty
so
while
he
kept
hidden
the
new
horns
grew
and
grew
until
they
were
greater
and
more
wonderful
than
the
ones
he
had
had
before
then
moose
once
more
came
forth
holding
his
head
high
and
glorying
in
his
strength
and
all
his
neighbors
treated
him
with
the
greatest
respect
quite
as
if
he
were
really
king
of
the
great
woods
but
he
never
forgot
what
old
mother
nature
had
said
to
him
and
when
the
spring
came
he
slipped
away
and
hid
lest
he
should
be
seen
without
the
glory
of
his
horns
for
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
old
mother
nature
would
keep
her
word
sure
enough
his
great
horns
dropped
off
and
in
humbleness
and
patience
he
waited
for
new
horns
to
grow
so
it
was
all
the
years
of
his
life
and
so
it
has
been
with
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
even
to
this
day
and
so
it
is
with
flathorns
and
so
it
will
be
with
his
children
and
the
moose
family
never
have
forgotten
and
never
can
forget
that
there
is
nothing
so
foolish
as
pride
in
personal
is
that
all
asked
peter
as
grandfather
frog
stopped
is
that
enough
demanded
grandfather
frog
testily
just
think
it
over
a
while
and
when
you
are
tempted
to
be
proud
and
haughty
just
remember
the
horns
of
moose
and
what
happened
to
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
the
story
replied
peter
politely
as
he
hopped
away
half
way
to
the
dear
old
he
paused
it
served
old
moose
just
right
he
declared
to
no
one
in
particular
and
so
it
did
vii
when
kingfisher
took
to
the
ground
rabbit
had
taken
it
into
his
funny
little
head
to
wander
down
the
laughing
brook
below
the
smiling
pool
it
was
open
there
and
in
one
place
the
bank
was
quite
high
and
steep
peter
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
and
looked
down
right
under
him
the
laughing
brook
was
very
quiet
and
clear
peter
sat
gazing
down
into
it
he
could
see
all
the
pebbles
on
the
bottom
and
queer
little
plants
growing
among
them
it
seemed
very
queer
very
queer
indeed
to
peter
that
plants
real
plants
could
be
growing
down
there
under
water
somehow
he
could
make
it
seem
right
that
anything
but
fish
should
be
able
to
live
down
there
so
peter
sat
gazing
down
lost
in
a
sort
of
the
jolly
little
sunbeams
made
beautiful
lights
and
shadows
in
the
water
everything
was
so
peaceful
and
beautiful
that
peter
quite
forgot
he
was
sitting
right
out
in
the
open
where
redtail
the
hawk
might
spy
him
he
just
gave
himself
up
to
dreams
you
know
presently
those
were
very
very
near
to
being
yes
sir
they
were
peter
actually
was
nodding
his
big
eyes
would
close
open
close
again
open
and
then
close
for
a
little
longer
suddenly
a
sharp
and
very
loud
noise
which
seemed
to
come
from
right
under
his
very
toes
put
an
end
to
all
nodding
and
dreaming
it
was
a
long
harsh
rattle
and
it
startled
peter
so
that
he
almost
jumped
out
of
his
skin
anyway
he
jumped
straight
up
in
the
air
and
the
wonder
was
that
he
did
tumble
headfirst
down
that
steep
bank
right
into
the
laughing
brook
a
queer
prickly
feeling
ran
all
over
him
he
blinked
his
eyes
rapidly
then
he
saw
a
handsome
blue
and
white
and
gray
bird
with
a
head
that
looked
too
big
for
his
body
flying
up
the
laughing
brook
just
above
the
water
and
as
he
flew
he
made
that
sharp
harsh
rattling
noise
which
had
startled
peter
so
abruptly
he
paused
in
his
flight
hovered
over
the
water
an
instant
shot
down
and
disappeared
with
a
tinkling
little
splash
a
second
later
he
was
in
the
air
again
and
in
his
stout
bill
was
a
gleaming
silvery
thing
it
was
a
little
fish
a
minnow
illustration
rattles
the
kingfisher
exclaimed
peter
as
he
watched
him
fly
over
to
a
tree
pound
the
fish
on
a
branch
and
then
go
through
the
funniest
performance
as
he
tried
to
swallow
the
minnow
whole
now
where
did
he
come
from
continued
peter
it
certainly
seemed
to
me
that
he
came
from
right
under
my
very
feet
but
there
is
so
much
as
a
twig
down
peter
poked
his
head
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
no
there
was
a
single
thing
down
there
on
which
rattles
could
have
been
sitting
he
was
still
wondering
about
it
when
his
wobbly
little
nose
caught
a
smell
a
very
unpleasant
smell
it
was
the
smell
of
fish
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
right
under
him
he
leaned
a
little
farther
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
then
he
gave
a
funny
little
gasp
there
was
a
in
the
bank
only
a
few
inches
below
him
and
the
smell
certainly
came
from
that
hole
could
it
be
could
it
possibly
be
that
rattles
had
come
out
of
that
hole
it
certainly
seemed
so
and
yet
peter
could
quite
believe
it
the
very
idea
of
a
bird
living
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
i
do
believe
it
i
do
so
there
exclaimed
peter
right
out
loud
what
is
it
you
do
believe
asked
a
voice
peter
looked
down
there
was
little
joe
otter
looking
up
at
him
from
the
water
his
eyes
twinkling
i
do
believe
that
rattles
the
kingfisher
came
out
of
that
hole
yet
i
do
see
where
else
he
could
have
come
from
replied
peter
little
joe
chuckled
that
where
he
came
from
even
if
you
believe
it
said
he
i
do
suppose
you
will
believe
that
he
dug
that
hole
himself
peter
eyes
opened
very
wide
i
i
believe
it
if
you
say
on
your
honor
that
it
realty
is
so
he
replied
slowly
on
my
honor
it
really
is
so
said
little
joe
otter
his
eyes
twinkling
more
than
ever
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
how
the
of
rattles
the
kingfisher
happened
to
take
the
ground
for
a
peter
eyes
fairly
danced
do
tell
me
little
joe
oh
please
tell
me
he
exclaimed
little
joe
climbed
out
of
the
water
on
a
rock
just
below
peter
and
settled
himself
comfortably
once
upon
a
time
he
began
in
the
beginning
of
things
prompted
peter
yes
in
the
beginning
of
things
replied
little
joe
way
back
when
the
world
was
young
lived
the
very
first
of
the
kingfisher
family
from
the
very
beginning
kingfisher
was
a
very
independent
fellow
he
cared
nothing
about
his
neighbors
that
is
he
was
not
social
he
was
polite
enough
but
he
preferred
his
own
company
and
was
never
happier
than
when
he
was
by
himself
of
course
his
neighbors
soon
found
this
out
they
called
him
odd
and
queer
and
soon
refused
to
even
speak
to
him
this
just
suited
kingfisher
and
he
went
about
his
business
very
well
content
to
be
let
alone
he
spent
his
days
fishing
and
because
there
were
few
other
fishermen
he
always
had
plenty
to
eat
at
night
he
found
a
comfortable
roost
in
a
tree
and
so
for
a
time
he
was
perfectly
contented
by
and
by
he
discovered
that
most
of
his
neighbors
were
building
homes
at
first
he
gave
little
attention
to
this
but
after
a
while
seeing
how
happy
they
were
he
began
to
think
about
a
home
for
himself
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
wanted
one
but
underneath
kingfisher
pointed
cap
were
very
clever
wits
he
would
do
nothing
hastily
so
he
flew
up
and
down
the
brook
appearing
to
do
nothing
but
fish
but
all
the
time
he
was
keeping
his
eyes
open
and
there
were
no
sharper
eyes
than
those
of
kingfisher
he
was
watching
his
neighbors
work
to
see
where
and
how
they
made
their
homes
he
saw
some
of
the
birds
building
nests
in
the
trees
some
building
them
in
the
bushes
and
a
few
building
right
on
the
ground
of
all
he
saw
he
liked
best
the
home
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
fellow
has
the
right
idea
thought
he
cuts
a
hole
in
a
tree
he
is
dry
he
is
warm
and
no
one
can
get
at
him
there
if
i
build
a
home
that
is
the
kind
of
place
i
want
he
has
got
what
i
call
plain
sense
plain
common
sense
after
this
kingfisher
watched
until
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
was
around
to
see
him
and
then
he
tried
to
make
a
hole
in
a
tree
as
he
had
seen
drummer
the
woodpecker
do
but
right
away
he
discovered
that
two
things
were
wrong
his
bill
was
not
made
for
cutting
wood
and
his
feet
were
not
big
enough
or
the
right
shape
for
clinging
to
the
side
of
a
tree
kingfisher
was
disappointed
very
much
disappointed
a
hole
seemed
to
him
the
only
kind
of
a
place
for
a
home
he
was
thinking
it
over
when
he
happened
to
discover
muskrat
digging
a
hole
in
the
bank
at
first
he
did
pay
much
attention
then
all
in
a
flash
an
idea
a
wonderful
idea
came
to
him
why
should
he
have
a
home
in
the
ground
no
one
in
the
wide
world
would
ever
think
of
looking
for
the
home
of
a
bird
in
the
ground
with
a
rattle
of
joy
kingfisher
flew
off
up
the
brook
to
a
steep
sandy
bank
of
which
he
knew
the
place
just
the
very
place
he
cried
make
a
hole
just
a
little
way
from
the
top
no
one
will
see
it
except
from
below
and
it
will
be
hard
work
for
any
one
to
climb
up
that
sandy
bank
he
flew
straight
at
the
spot
he
had
selected
and
drove
his
big
bill
into
it
then
he
did
it
again
and
again
that
bill
would
cut
wood
like
the
bill
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
but
it
certainly
would
cut
into
a
sandy
bank
in
a
little
while
he
had
room
to
cling
with
his
feet
then
he
could
work
faster
and
more
easily
pretty
soon
he
had
a
hole
deep
enough
to
get
into
he
would
loosen
the
earth
with
his
hill
and
scrape
it
out
with
his
feet
he
was
so
pleased
with
his
discovery
that
he
kept
right
on
working
he
almost
forgot
to
eat
all
the
time
he
could
spare
from
fishing
he
spent
digging
day
after
day
he
worked
when
he
had
a
hole
three
or
four
feet
straight
into
the
bank
he
made
a
turn
in
it
and
then
kept
on
digging
when
he
had
gone
far
enough
in
he
made
a
little
bedroom
at
last
the
house
was
done
kingfisher
chuckled
happily
no
one
could
get
at
him
there
he
had
the
best
and
safest
home
he
knew
of
it
was
better
than
the
home
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
if
mink
happened
to
find
it
and
kingfisher
could
think
of
no
one
else
who
would
be
likely
to
there
would
be
nothing
to
fear
for
mink
would
never
dare
face
that
sharp
hill
in
such
a
narrow
place
it
all
worked
out
just
as
kingfisher
thought
it
would
no
one
dreamed
of
looking
in
the
ground
for
his
home
and
for
a
long
long
time
he
kept
his
secret
so
well
that
his
neighbors
thought
he
had
no
home
and
called
him
the
homeless
from
that
day
to
this
the
kingfishers
have
made
their
homes
in
the
ground
concluded
little
joe
otter
is
it
wonderful
exclaimed
peter
as
he
watched
rattles
dive
into
the
water
and
catch
a
silvery
minnow
i
did
know
that
any
one
wearing
feathers
had
so
much
there
a
great
deal
you
do
know
peter
replied
little
joe
otter
sliding
into
the
water
viii
when
old
badger
learned
to
stay
at
home
first
time
peter
rabbit
saw
digger
the
badger
he
laughed
at
him
yes
sir
peter
laughed
at
him
he
laughed
until
he
had
to
hold
his
sides
when
he
got
back
to
the
dear
old
he
told
little
peter
all
about
digger
that
is
he
told
her
all
that
he
had
seen
which
was
really
very
little
indeed
about
digger
as
he
found
out
later
i
found
him
away
over
on
the
green
meadows
in
a
place
where
i
have
never
been
before
and
i
almost
stepped
on
him
before
i
saw
him
you
should
have
seen
me
jump
i
guess
it
is
lucky
i
did
too
for
he
certainly
has
got
the
teeth
and
i
did
like
the
way
he
snarled
then
at
a
safe
distance
i
sat
down
and
laughed
i
just
had
to
why
his
legs
are
so
short
and
his
coat
hangs
down
so
on
each
side
that
he
does
seem
to
have
any
legs
at
all
and
as
for
shape
he
has
any
he
is
so
broad
and
flat
that
he
looks
as
if
something
big
and
heavy
had
passed
over
him
and
rolled
him
out
flat
but
how
he
can
dig
if
johnny
chuck
should
ever
see
him
digging
johnny
would
die
of
envy
i
going
over
there
again
to
learn
more
about
you
better
stay
at
home
and
mind
your
own
affairs
replied
little
peter
tartly
no
good
comes
of
poking
into
the
affairs
of
other
this
is
true
and
peter
knows
it
but
he
just
could
keep
away
from
that
part
of
the
green
meadows
where
he
had
discovered
digger
the
badger
the
more
he
saw
of
digger
the
greater
became
his
curiosity
about
him
the
less
peter
can
find
out
for
himself
about
any
one
the
more
curious
he
becomes
and
all
he
could
find
out
about
digger
was
that
he
slept
most
of
the
day
never
went
far
from
home
could
dig
faster
than
any
one
peter
had
ever
heard
of
was
and
was
treated
with
respect
by
all
his
neighbors
even
old
man
coyote
who
seemed
to
know
him
very
well
all
this
made
peter
more
curious
than
ever
so
one
day
when
old
man
coyote
happened
along
by
the
old
peter
ventured
to
ask
him
about
digger
the
badger
old
man
coyote
happened
to
be
feeling
in
fine
humor
for
he
had
just
eaten
a
good
dinner
so
he
sat
down
just
outside
the
dear
old
and
this
is
what
he
told
peter
digger
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
would
advise
you
to
treat
him
with
the
greatest
respect
peter
because
if
you
do
and
he
ever
gets
his
claws
on
you
that
will
be
the
end
of
you
i
would
care
to
get
in
a
fight
with
him
myself
big
as
i
am
you
may
have
noticed
that
no
one
ever
bothers
peter
nodded
and
old
man
coyote
continued
i
know
of
any
one
who
minds
his
own
business
and
keeps
his
nose
out
of
the
affairs
of
other
people
as
digger
does
greatest
homebody
i
know
of
unless
it
johnny
chuck
and
even
johnny
wanders
off
once
in
a
while
but
digger
never
gets
very
far
from
his
own
doorstep
says
there
is
no
place
like
home
and
he
ca
see
what
anybody
wants
to
leave
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
even
if
they
can
come
back
to
peter
reached
over
and
poked
peter
in
the
back
but
he
did
even
look
at
her
you
know
she
is
always
trying
to
keep
peter
from
roaming
about
so
old
man
coyote
went
on
with
his
story
it
is
because
digger
is
afraid
goodness
no
i
do
know
of
any
one
better
able
to
take
care
of
himself
than
digger
the
badger
i
guess
it
is
because
his
family
always
have
been
i
heard
my
grandfather
tell
how
digger
grandfather
was
just
the
same
as
digger
is
and
how
he
had
heard
his
grandfather
say
the
same
thing
about
digger
grandfather
grandfather
they
say
that
the
very
first
badger
who
founded
the
family
way
back
in
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
started
this
habit
and
that
all
badgers
ever
since
then
have
been
just
like
him
digger
is
terribly
proud
of
his
family
and
of
old
badger
who
founded
it
so
long
ago
i
do
know
as
i
wonder
at
it
old
badger
certainly
had
more
sense
than
some
of
his
neighbors
you
see
when
old
mother
nature
first
turned
him
loose
in
the
great
world
he
felt
that
she
had
not
been
at
all
fair
in
her
treatment
of
him
his
legs
were
so
short
and
he
was
so
broad
and
flat
that
everybody
or
nearly
everybody
laughed
at
him
and
poked
fun
at
him
he
pretended
not
to
care
but
he
did
care
just
the
same
no
one
really
likes
to
be
laughed
at
for
something
he
can
not
help
badger
would
watch
his
neighbors
wolf
and
fox
and
rabbit
and
others
run
and
jump
and
then
he
would
try
to
do
as
they
did
and
he
because
his
legs
were
so
short
and
so
clumsy
he
would
sit
for
hours
admiring
the
graceful
forms
of
his
neighbors
and
comparing
them
with
his
own
homely
shape
he
would
wonder
what
old
mother
nature
could
have
been
thinking
of
when
she
made
him
but
he
did
say
so
to
her
no
indeed
he
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
and
never
let
his
neighbors
know
that
he
envied
them
in
the
least
one
day
he
wandered
out
from
the
green
forest
on
to
the
green
meadows
he
liked
it
out
there
he
liked
to
look
up
and
see
so
much
of
the
blue
blue
sky
all
at
once
he
liked
to
look
off
and
see
a
long
distance
of
course
he
could
do
that
in
the
green
forest
because
of
the
trees
he
liked
being
by
himself
because
he
felt
so
sensitive
about
his
homely
shape
he
discovered
that
if
he
lay
down
flat
on
his
stomach
when
any
one
came
near
he
was
always
passed
unnoticed
being
so
broad
and
flat
and
altogether
shapeless
he
could
remain
unseen
right
out
there
on
the
open
green
meadows
even
when
the
grass
was
short
and
that
was
something
that
wolf
and
fox
and
even
little
rabbit
could
do
it
pleased
him
he
began
to
be
less
envious
of
his
neighbors
then
one
day
the
red
terror
which
men
call
fire
broke
loose
in
the
green
forest
and
all
the
little
people
fled
before
it
across
the
meadows
and
past
old
badger
they
raced
with
fear
in
their
eyes
and
behind
them
came
the
red
terror
a
terrible
fear
sprang
up
in
the
heart
of
badger
with
those
short
legs
he
never
in
the
world
could
run
fast
enough
to
escape
what
should
he
do
what
he
do
he
looked
at
the
great
claws
on
his
stout
feet
and
all
in
a
flash
an
idea
came
to
him
perhaps
if
he
dug
a
hole
and
crawled
into
it
the
red
terror
would
not
find
him
at
once
he
began
to
dig
and
how
the
dirt
did
fly
in
just
no
time
at
all
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
and
by
the
time
the
red
terror
had
reached
there
he
was
so
far
down
in
the
ground
that
he
did
even
feel
the
heat
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
earth
had
cooled
off
so
that
he
could
come
out
he
sat
on
the
pile
of
dirt
in
front
of
his
hole
and
did
some
hard
thinking
he
looked
at
his
stout
legs
and
long
claws
and
all
at
once
it
came
over
him
that
old
mother
nature
had
not
been
so
unfair
after
all
she
had
provided
him
with
a
means
to
take
care
of
himself
which
he
would
exchange
with
any
of
his
neighbors
for
all
their
speed
and
better
looks
later
when
he
saw
how
some
of
them
were
worn
out
with
running
and
some
of
them
even
had
burned
places
on
their
coats
the
last
bit
of
envy
disappeared
guess
said
he
to
himself
mother
nature
has
given
each
one
special
blessings
but
she
expects
us
to
find
them
out
for
ourselves
i
found
mine
out
some
of
them
anyway
and
i
just
get
busy
and
look
for
the
rest
i
going
straight
over
to
the
prettiest
part
of
the
green
meadows
where
the
red
terror
has
been
and
dig
myself
a
house
in
the
ground
there
is
no
place
like
a
good
home
so
what
is
the
good
of
roaming
around
my
legs
were
not
intended
for
that
and
those
who
have
got
longer
legs
can
do
it
if
they
want
to
he
did
just
what
he
said
he
would
do
he
practised
digging
until
he
was
the
best
digger
of
all
the
little
people
the
more
he
dug
the
stouter
and
stronger
his
legs
became
and
soon
he
found
that
all
his
neighbors
respected
his
strength
and
none
would
quarrel
with
him
because
he
could
get
plenty
to
eat
near
his
home
he
never
went
far
from
his
doorstep
and
from
that
time
on
he
lived
in
perfect
safety
and
contentment
he
brought
his
children
up
to
do
the
same
thing
and
if
you
should
go
over
and
ask
digger
he
would
tell
you
that
there
is
no
place
like
home
and
that
he
envies
no
one
i
glad
however
that
not
every
one
agrees
with
him
or
i
should
have
hard
work
to
get
a
living
concluded
old
man
coyote
with
a
sly
wink
at
peter
ix
when
bob
white
won
his
name
is
the
story
of
the
bob
white
you
know
and
yet
when
i
think
it
over
i
do
know
but
that
it
is
after
all
it
is
the
story
of
the
first
bob
white
the
of
the
bob
white
you
know
and
i
know
and
everybody
who
ever
has
heard
his
whistle
knows
it
is
a
story
of
that
time
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
when
the
world
was
young
and
yet
i
guess
it
is
just
as
much
our
own
bob
white
story
as
it
is
his
you
see
it
is
because
of
it
of
what
happened
in
that
time
that
bob
white
bob
white
so
that
makes
it
his
story
too
does
it
anyway
i
tell
you
the
story
and
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
old
mother
west
wind
told
me
the
story
and
she
got
it
from
peter
rabbit
and
peter
got
it
from
well
i
do
know
for
sure
but
i
suspect
he
got
it
from
bob
white
himself
you
know
peter
and
bob
white
are
great
friends
they
are
very
near
neighbors
they
are
such
near
neighbors
and
such
good
friends
that
if
it
popped
into
peter
funny
little
head
to
be
curious
about
bob
white
affairs
he
hesitate
an
instant
to
ask
bob
about
them
anyway
some
one
told
peter
the
story
and
i
like
to
think
that
that
some
one
was
none
other
than
that
little
whistler
bob
white
the
quail
himself
here
is
the
story
as
old
mother
west
wind
told
it
to
me
long
long
ago
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
when
the
world
was
young
when
the
green
meadows
were
new
and
the
green
forest
was
new
and
the
smiling
pool
and
the
laughing
brook
and
the
big
river
were
new
and
the
little
and
big
people
whom
old
mother
nature
put
in
them
to
live
were
new
too
being
the
very
first
each
of
his
kind
things
were
different
quite
different
from
what
they
are
now
old
mother
nature
was
busier
than
she
is
now
and
goodness
knows
she
is
busy
enough
these
days
in
fact
she
is
a
million
times
busier
than
the
busiest
other
person
in
all
the
great
world
if
she
was
if
she
grew
tired
or
lazy
or
careless
or
anything
like
that
i
am
afraid
things
would
go
so
wrong
with
the
great
world
that
they
never
never
could
be
righted
again
but
in
these
days
in
the
beginning
of
things
she
was
busier
still
it
is
always
easier
to
keep
things
going
after
they
are
once
started
than
it
is
to
start
them
and
old
mother
nature
was
just
starting
things
so
she
started
a
great
many
of
the
little
people
off
in
life
and
told
them
to
make
the
best
of
things
as
they
found
them
in
the
great
world
and
do
as
well
as
they
could
while
she
was
attending
to
other
matters
now
one
of
these
little
people
was
a
plump
little
person
in
a
coat
of
feathers
he
was
quail
the
of
all
the
quails
to
quail
as
to
all
the
others
old
mother
nature
said
great
world
is
new
there
is
a
place
in
it
for
you
but
you
must
find
that
place
for
yourself
there
is
work
for
you
to
do
but
you
must
find
out
for
yourself
what
it
is
when
you
have
real
need
of
anything
come
to
me
but
do
bother
me
until
you
do
have
no
one
who
proves
to
be
helpless
or
useless
will
live
long
now
run
along
and
prove
whether
or
not
you
have
a
right
to
live
so
little
quail
went
out
among
the
other
people
in
the
great
world
to
try
and
find
his
place
all
the
other
people
were
trying
to
find
their
places
and
some
of
them
were
having
a
dreadful
time
doing
it
a
great
many
began
by
trying
to
do
just
what
their
neighbors
did
which
was
the
very
worst
kind
of
a
mistake
it
was
a
pure
waste
of
time
worse
still
it
was
making
a
place
in
the
work
of
the
great
world
little
quail
eyes
were
very
bright
and
he
used
them
for
all
they
were
worth
his
wits
were
quite
as
bright
and
he
used
these
the
same
way
are
two
things
for
me
to
find
out
said
he
to
himself
i
ca
do
and
what
i
can
do
the
sooner
i
find
out
what
i
ca
do
the
more
time
i
have
to
find
out
what
i
can
do
i
got
wings
and
that
must
mean
that
old
mother
nature
intends
me
to
fly
i
glad
of
that
it
must
be
fine
to
sail
around
up
in
the
air
and
see
all
that
is
going
on
down
below
up
overhead
ol
mistah
buzzard
was
sailing
and
high
up
in
the
sky
with
hardly
a
motion
of
his
broad
wings
little
quail
watched
him
a
long
time
and
a
great
longing
to
do
the
same
thing
filled
him
at
last
he
sprang
into
the
air
and
right
then
he
made
a
discovery
yes
sir
he
made
a
discovery
he
must
beat
his
wings
with
all
his
might
in
order
to
stay
in
the
air
when
he
stopped
beating
them
and
held
them
spread
out
as
ol
mistah
buzzard
did
he
found
that
he
simply
sailed
a
little
way
straight
ahead
and
then
began
to
come
down
he
must
keep
those
wings
moving
very
fast
or
else
come
down
to
the
ground
then
he
made
another
discovery
in
a
very
little
while
his
wings
were
so
tired
that
he
just
had
to
stop
flying
little
quail
squatted
in
the
grass
and
panted
for
breath
he
was
disappointed
terribly
disappointed
plain
to
me
that
old
mother
nature
does
intend
that
i
shall
spend
my
time
sailing
about
in
the
air
said
he
he
scratched
his
pretty
little
head
thoughtfully
can
fly
pretty
fast
for
a
short
distance
he
continued
talking
to
himself
that
is
all
that
must
mean
that
i
have
been
given
wings
for
use
only
in
time
of
need
there
are
some
birds
flitting
about
in
a
tree
they
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
i
think
i
join
them
if
i
sail
about
in
the
air
the
next
best
thing
will
be
flitting
about
in
the
trees
so
after
he
had
rested
a
bit
little
quail
flew
to
the
tree
where
the
other
birds
were
flitting
about
and
there
he
made
another
disappointing
discovery
try
as
he
would
he
could
flit
about
as
they
did
moreover
he
did
feel
comfortable
perched
in
a
tree
for
any
length
of
time
it
made
his
toes
ache
to
bend
them
around
the
branch
on
which
he
was
sitting
he
watched
the
other
birds
and
his
bright
eyes
soon
discovered
that
their
feet
were
different
from
his
feet
their
toes
were
made
to
clutch
twigs
and
hold
them
there
comfortably
while
his
were
not
mother
nature
does
intend
that
i
shall
spend
my
time
flitting
about
in
trees
said
he
sorrowfully
and
flew
down
to
the
ground
once
more
right
away
his
feet
felt
better
all
the
ache
left
them
it
was
good
to
be
on
the
ground
pretty
soon
he
began
to
run
about
it
was
good
to
run
about
he
felt
as
if
he
could
run
all
day
without
getting
tired
while
hunting
for
food
he
discovered
that
if
his
toes
were
not
made
for
perching
in
trees
they
certainly
were
made
for
scratching
over
leaves
and
loose
earth
where
stray
seeds
were
hiding
then
he
made
still
another
discovery
his
coat
was
just
the
right
color
to
make
it
hard
work
for
others
to
see
him
when
he
squatted
down
close
to
the
ground
if
an
enemy
did
discover
him
his
stout
little
wings
took
him
out
of
danger
like
a
bullet
little
by
little
it
came
over
him
that
he
had
found
his
place
in
the
great
world
which
was
on
the
ground
most
of
the
time
but
he
remembered
what
old
mother
nature
had
said
about
work
to
do
and
this
worried
him
a
little
one
day
he
watched
toad
catching
bugs
old
toad
was
grumbling
ca
keep
up
with
these
pesky
bugs
said
he
i
get
my
stomach
full
i
have
to
wait
for
it
to
get
empty
again
before
i
can
catch
any
more
but
do
wait
keep
right
on
eating
all
the
time
and
there
wo
be
any
green
things
left
if
i
do
have
help
illustration
little
quail
grew
thoughtful
then
he
started
in
to
help
old
toad
catch
bugs
so
as
to
give
the
green
things
a
chance
to
grow
he
had
found
work
to
do
and
he
did
it
with
all
his
might
he
forgot
he
ever
had
wanted
to
sail
around
in
the
air
or
flit
about
in
the
trees
he
had
found
his
place
in
the
great
world
and
he
had
found
work
to
do
and
also
he
had
found
the
secret
of
the
truest
happiness
he
was
so
happy
that
he
had
to
tell
his
neighbors
about
it
so
every
morning
just
before
starting
work
he
would
fly
up
on
a
stump
and
whistle
with
all
his
might
what
he
tried
to
say
was
right
right
but
what
his
neighbors
thought
he
said
was
white
white
so
they
promptly
called
him
bob
white
and
loved
him
for
the
cheer
which
his
clear
whistle
brought
to
them
when
old
mother
nature
came
to
see
how
things
were
getting
on
she
found
little
quail
the
happiest
and
the
most
useful
of
all
the
birds
and
as
she
listened
to
his
whistle
she
smiled
and
said
love
you
bob
white
and
all
the
world
shall
love
you
and
all
the
world
has
loved
him
to
this
very
x
when
became
grateful
something
move
among
the
dead
leaves
along
that
old
log
or
was
it
the
wind
that
stirred
them
peter
rabbit
stared
very
hard
trying
to
find
out
not
that
it
made
the
least
bit
of
difference
to
peter
it
did
if
something
alive
had
moved
those
leaves
that
something
was
too
small
for
peter
to
fear
it
probably
it
was
a
worm
or
a
bug
it
might
have
been
a
beetle
that
looked
like
a
good
place
for
beetles
there
was
jimmy
skunk
ambling
down
the
lone
little
path
this
very
minute
and
jimmy
always
appeared
to
be
looking
for
beetles
peter
stared
harder
than
ever
a
leaf
moved
another
turned
fairly
over
there
was
any
wind
just
then
dead
leaves
do
turn
over
of
themselves
so
there
must
be
something
alive
there
what
has
peter
on
his
mind
this
morning
to
make
him
stare
so
asked
jimmy
skunk
as
he
ambled
up
peter
grinned
i
was
just
wondering
said
he
if
there
are
any
fat
beetles
under
that
log
over
there
those
dead
leaves
along
the
side
of
it
have
a
way
of
moving
once
in
a
while
without
cause
that
i
can
see
there
what
did
i
tell
you
sure
enough
a
couple
of
leaves
had
moved
jimmy
skunk
eyes
brightened
he
actually
almost
hurried
over
to
that
old
log
and
began
to
rake
away
the
leaves
suddenly
he
stopped
and
sniffed
at
the
same
time
peter
thought
he
saw
something
dart
in
at
the
hollow
end
of
that
log
it
might
have
been
a
shadow
but
peter
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
jimmy
skunk
sniffed
once
more
and
then
deliberately
turned
his
back
on
that
old
log
and
with
his
nose
turned
up
his
face
the
very
picture
of
disgust
and
disappointment
he
rejoined
peter
teeny
weeny
clever
and
spry
disappears
while
you
wink
an
eye
said
jimmy
oh
exclaimed
peter
is
that
who
it
was
i
suppose
he
was
hunting
beetles
himself
he
such
a
little
mite
of
a
fellow
that
i
should
think
a
goodsized
beetle
could
almost
carry
him
away
i
declare
to
goodness
i
do
see
how
any
one
so
small
manages
to
live
danny
meadow
mouse
and
whitefoot
the
wood
mouse
are
small
enough
but
they
are
giants
compared
with
teeny
weeny
the
shrew
they
have
a
hard
enough
time
keeping
alive
and
i
should
think
that
any
one
smaller
would
stand
no
chance
at
do
you
know
teeny
weeny
very
well
asked
jimmy
no
confessed
peter
i
seen
him
only
a
few
times
and
then
had
no
more
than
a
glimpse
of
and
yet
he
lives
right
around
here
where
you
come
and
go
every
day
said
jimmy
i
know
it
replied
peter
i
suppose
it
is
because
he
is
so
small
he
can
hide
under
next
to
jimmy
grinned
i
do
see
but
what
you
answered
yourself
he
chuckled
it
because
he
is
so
small
that
teeny
weeny
manages
to
keep
out
of
harm
he
is
very
good
eating
anyway
so
i
have
heard
why
because
there
is
enough
of
him
to
make
a
bite
asked
peter
no
replied
jimmy
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
heard
those
who
do
say
that
a
shrew
does
taste
good
and
that
no
one
who
is
at
all
particular
about
his
food
will
touch
one
i
am
told
that
hooty
the
owl
hunts
teeny
weeny
but
hooty
is
at
all
particular
you
know
if
teeny
weeny
tastes
the
way
he
smells
i
for
one
do
want
to
try
peter
laughed
right
out
he
could
help
it
the
idea
of
jimmy
skunk
being
fussy
about
smells
was
too
funny
what
are
you
laughing
at
demanded
jimmy
suspiciously
at
the
idea
that
any
one
so
small
can
smell
bad
enough
to
make
any
difference
replied
peter
i
wonder
how
he
comes
to
have
that
bad
it
a
reward
replied
jimmy
it
a
reward
handed
down
to
him
from
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
and
his
the
first
shrew
you
know
who
was
also
called
teeny
weeny
was
given
it
by
old
mother
nature
because
he
had
sense
enough
to
be
grateful
and
to
tell
her
that
he
it
a
story
cried
peter
it
a
story
and
you
just
got
to
tell
it
to
me
jimmy
say
please
grinned
jimmy
please
please
please
please
replied
peter
if
that
is
enough
i
say
it
as
many
times
i
guess
that
will
do
because
after
all
it
is
so
very
much
of
a
story
returned
jimmy
scratching
his
head
as
if
he
were
trying
to
stir
up
his
memory
it
happened
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
that
when
old
mother
nature
had
about
finished
making
the
birds
and
the
animals
she
had
just
a
teeny
weeny
pinch
of
the
stuff
they
were
made
of
left
over
because
she
could
then
and
ca
now
bear
to
be
wasteful
she
started
to
make
something
first
she
started
to
make
it
into
a
very
tiny
mouse
then
she
changed
her
mind
and
started
to
make
it
into
a
tiny
mole
finally
she
changed
her
mind
again
and
made
it
into
something
like
each
but
not
just
like
either
blew
the
breath
of
life
into
it
and
set
it
free
in
the
great
world
that
was
teeny
weeny
the
first
shrew
and
the
smallest
of
all
animals
for
a
while
teeny
weeny
wished
that
he
had
been
made
at
all
he
wished
that
old
mother
nature
had
been
so
thrifty
and
saving
what
was
the
good
of
being
an
animal
at
all
if
he
was
big
enough
to
be
recognized
as
such
that
the
way
he
felt
about
it
for
a
while
it
hurt
his
feelings
to
have
old
king
bear
say
after
just
missing
him
with
his
great
foot
beg
your
pardon
you
are
so
tiny
i
thought
you
were
a
bug
of
some
kind
of
course
i
do
mind
stepping
on
bugs
but
i
step
on
you
for
the
world
why
do
you
grow
so
that
we
can
see
you
why
do
you
asked
old
wolf
you
get
stepped
on
blame
us
even
meadow
mouse
laughed
at
him
because
he
was
so
small
teeny
weeny
was
quite
furious
at
that
so
for
a
while
he
was
very
unhappy
because
he
was
so
small
he
ate
and
ate
and
ate
hoping
that
this
would
make
him
grow
bigger
but
it
did
he
remained
as
small
as
ever
the
smallest
of
all
the
people
and
his
temper
improve
not
a
bit
he
was
fretful
and
snappish
he
said
all
sorts
of
things
about
old
mother
nature
because
she
had
made
him
so
small
he
almost
hated
her
he
could
see
a
single
advantage
in
being
so
small
time
went
on
and
at
length
came
the
hard
times
of
which
you
have
heard
the
times
when
food
was
so
scarce
and
most
of
the
little
people
were
always
hungry
then
it
was
that
the
big
and
strong
began
to
hunt
the
small
and
weak
as
you
know
at
first
teeny
weeny
was
in
a
regular
panic
of
fear
he
felt
that
because
he
was
so
small
he
had
any
chance
at
all
but
after
a
while
he
made
a
discovery
a
most
amazing
discovery
it
quite
took
his
breath
away
when
he
first
realized
it
it
was
that
because
he
was
so
small
he
had
more
chance
than
some
of
those
of
whom
he
had
been
envious
because
he
was
so
small
he
could
slip
out
of
sight
in
a
twinkling
he
could
slip
into
holes
that
no
one
else
could
get
into
a
leaf
on
the
ground
would
hide
him
then
he
discovered
that
because
he
was
so
very
small
it
did
take
much
food
to
fill
his
stomach
and
he
had
no
trouble
in
finding
all
he
needed
to
eat
while
his
neighbors
were
going
hungry
he
was
fat
and
comfortable
bugs
there
were
and
worms
there
were
in
plenty
and
on
these
he
lived
one
day
he
saw
old
mother
nature
and
she
looked
worried
she
worried
it
was
in
the
very
middle
of
the
hard
times
and
wherever
she
went
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
crowded
about
her
to
complain
and
ask
her
help
teeny
weeny
remembered
all
the
bitter
things
he
had
said
and
all
the
bitter
thoughts
he
had
had
because
she
had
made
him
so
small
and
he
was
ashamed
yes
sir
he
was
ashamed
you
see
he
realized
by
this
time
that
his
small
size
was
his
greatest
blessing
what
did
teeny
weeny
do
but
march
right
straight
up
to
old
mother
nature
the
first
chance
he
got
and
tell
her
how
grateful
he
was
for
what
she
had
done
for
him
he
was
quite
honest
he
told
her
how
he
had
felt
and
how
he
had
said
bitter
things
and
how
sorry
he
was
now
that
he
understood
how
well
off
he
was
then
he
thanked
her
once
more
and
turned
to
leave
old
mother
nature
called
him
back
she
was
wonderfully
pleased
to
have
these
few
words
of
thanks
amid
so
many
complaints
weeny
said
she
you
have
been
smart
enough
to
see
and
honest
enough
to
admit
a
blessing
in
what
you
had
thought
a
hardship
and
because
you
have
been
grateful
instead
of
complaining
i
herewith
give
you
this
musky
odor
which
will
be
distasteful
to
even
the
hungriest
of
your
enemies
it
is
a
further
protection
to
you
and
your
children
and
your
children
children
for
ever
and
ever
and
so
it
was
and
so
it
has
been
and
so
it
is
and
that
all
concluded
jimmy
skunk
xi
when
old
hare
became
a
turncoat
is
considered
a
very
nice
name
to
call
any
one
you
see
it
is
supposed
to
mean
one
who
has
turned
traitor
as
it
were
has
been
on
one
side
and
gone
over
to
the
other
side
if
a
soldier
who
is
fighting
for
france
should
go
over
to
the
german
army
and
fight
for
germany
against
france
he
would
be
a
turncoat
benedict
arnold
of
whom
you
have
read
in
history
was
a
turncoat
but
the
meaning
is
always
bad
just
take
the
case
of
jumper
the
hare
in
summer
he
wears
a
coat
of
brown
but
in
winter
he
wears
a
coat
of
white
the
white
of
the
pure
driven
snow
so
you
see
he
is
a
turncoat
but
in
his
case
it
mean
anything
bad
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
means
something
rather
nice
and
very
interesting
now
you
know
jumper
is
the
cousin
of
peter
rabbit
and
looks
very
much
like
peter
save
that
he
is
very
much
larger
and
has
longer
hind
legs
and
longer
ears
but
peter
wears
the
same
little
homely
brown
coat
in
winter
that
he
does
in
summer
the
only
difference
being
that
it
is
thicker
and
so
warmer
i
am
afraid
that
peter
has
sometimes
let
a
little
envy
creep
into
his
heart
when
he
has
met
his
cousin
wearing
a
coat
of
pure
white
be
that
as
it
may
peter
puzzled
over
the
matter
a
great
deal
until
he
found
out
from
grandfather
frog
how
it
happens
that
jumper
has
such
a
lovely
winter
coat
it
happened
one
evening
in
early
june
when
peter
was
hopping
along
down
the
lone
little
path
through
the
green
forest
that
he
met
jumper
and
stopped
to
gossip
for
a
few
minutes
he
had
not
seen
jumper
since
gentle
sister
south
wind
had
swept
away
the
last
of
the
winter
snow
then
jumper
coat
had
been
white
now
it
was
brown
this
reminded
peter
that
he
never
had
been
able
to
tease
jumper
into
telling
him
how
he
could
change
his
coat
that
way
none
of
peter
other
friends
of
the
winter
seemed
to
know
for
he
had
asked
all
of
them
and
each
had
told
him
to
ask
grandfather
frog
of
course
peter
could
do
that
in
winter
because
grandfather
frog
was
then
fast
asleep
in
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
smiling
pool
with
the
coming
of
spring
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
now
at
the
sight
of
jumper
once
more
it
all
came
back
to
him
when
peter
and
jumper
parted
peter
started
for
the
smiling
pool
he
arrived
there
quite
out
of
breath
grandfather
frog
smiled
a
big
broad
smile
before
peter
could
say
a
word
grandfather
frog
spoke
if
you
will
catch
a
foolish
green
fly
for
me
peter
ill
tell
you
the
story
said
he
for
a
full
minute
peter
could
find
his
tongue
he
was
so
surprised
how
do
you
know
what
story
i
want
he
stammered
at
last
i
do
know
but
that
does
make
any
difference
replied
grandfather
frog
catch
me
a
foolish
green
fly
and
i
tell
you
any
story
you
but
but
but
i
ca
catch
foolish
green
flies
cried
peter
i
would
if
i
could
but
i
ca
and
you
know
i
you
can
try
replied
grandfather
frog
gruffly
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
which
peter
did
see
peter
hesitated
then
suddenly
he
shut
his
lips
in
a
way
that
meant
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
something
he
looked
this
way
and
that
way
whichever
way
he
looked
he
saw
foolish
green
flies
flitting
about
he
jumped
for
one
and
missed
it
he
jumped
for
another
and
missed
it
it
was
the
beginning
of
such
a
funny
performance
that
grandfather
frog
nearly
rolled
off
his
big
green
with
laughter
peter
raced
and
jumped
this
way
and
that
way
on
the
banks
of
the
smiling
pool
as
if
he
had
gone
quite
crazy
and
at
last
in
his
excitement
jumped
right
into
the
smiling
pool
itself
after
a
foolish
green
fly
but
not
one
did
he
catch
as
he
crawled
out
of
the
water
looking
forlorn
enough
grandfather
frog
took
pity
on
him
said
he
lie
down
there
in
the
sun
and
dry
off
peter
and
i
tell
you
the
but
i
have
caught
you
a
foolish
green
fly
exclaimed
peter
no
but
you
tried
and
willingness
to
try
is
just
as
deserving
of
reward
as
successful
effort
now
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
know
replied
grandfather
frog
if
you
please
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
my
cousin
jumper
the
hare
happens
to
have
a
white
coat
in
winter
it
seems
to
me
very
curious
replied
peter
a
long
time
ago
in
the
beginning
of
things
began
grandfather
frog
old
mother
nature
gave
the
first
hare
a
brown
coat
and
turned
him
out
into
the
great
world
to
shift
for
himself
just
as
she
had
done
with
all
the
other
animals
that
was
a
very
easy
matter
for
old
hare
who
was
old
then
of
course
you
see
those
were
good
times
with
plenty
for
all
to
eat
without
trying
to
eat
each
other
hare
was
very
bashful
and
like
most
bashful
people
he
liked
to
be
by
himself
so
he
made
his
home
in
the
most
lonely
part
of
the
green
forest
and
was
very
happy
and
contented
for
a
long
time
now
being
alone
so
much
made
him
very
timid
ready
to
jump
and
run
at
the
least
unusual
sound
and
this
it
happens
proved
to
be
a
very
good
thing
for
hare
you
see
being
by
himself
that
way
he
had
plenty
to
eat
even
after
the
hard
times
of
which
you
had
begun
so
he
was
in
splendid
condition
was
hare
even
after
some
of
the
other
little
people
had
begun
to
grow
thin
because
of
lack
of
food
one
day
lynx
happened
to
stray
to
that
part
of
the
green
forest
where
hare
was
living
he
saw
hare
before
hare
saw
him
he
licked
his
lips
hungrily
thought
he
is
where
i
get
a
good
dinner
with
this
he
began
to
creep
ever
so
softly
towards
hare
but
careful
as
he
was
he
stepped
on
a
tiny
stick
and
it
snapped
instantly
away
went
hare
without
stopping
to
see
what
had
made
the
noise
that
was
because
he
had
grown
so
timid
from
living
so
much
alone
then
lynx
made
a
mistake
with
a
yell
he
started
after
hare
and
so
hare
learned
that
it
was
no
longer
safe
to
trust
his
neighbors
lynx
did
catch
hare
because
hare
was
too
swift
of
foot
for
him
but
he
gave
him
such
a
scare
was
that
hare
was
more
timid
than
ever
illustration
others
tried
to
catch
him
and
little
by
little
hare
learned
that
he
must
always
be
on
the
watch
and
that
safety
lay
in
two
things
his
long
legs
and
his
brown
coat
he
learned
about
the
latter
by
being
surprised
once
by
wolf
he
knew
that
wolf
did
see
him
as
he
crouched
among
the
brown
leaves
for
once
he
was
too
frightened
to
run
wolf
was
so
close
to
him
and
this
as
it
happened
was
a
very
good
thing
wolf
trotted
right
past
without
seeing
him
or
smelling
him
after
that
hare
tried
that
trick
often
for
he
was
smart
was
hare
when
he
suspected
that
he
had
been
seen
he
ran
but
when
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
seen
he
sat
tight
right
where
he
happened
to
be
but
when
the
first
snow
came
hare
found
himself
in
a
peck
of
trouble
he
did
dare
sit
still
when
an
enemy
was
near
because
his
brown
coat
stood
out
so
against
the
white
snow
and
when
he
ran
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
keep
him
in
sight
one
day
he
was
squatting
under
a
hemlock
bough
when
he
was
startled
by
the
howl
of
wolf
not
far
away
in
his
fright
he
jumped
up
and
the
next
thing
he
knew
down
came
the
snow
from
the
bough
all
over
him
then
to
his
dismay
he
saw
lynx
not
two
jumps
away
he
sat
still
from
force
of
habit
lynx
did
see
him
he
went
right
past
presently
wolf
came
along
and
he
went
right
past
mr
hare
was
puzzled
then
he
just
happened
to
glance
at
his
coat
he
was
white
with
snow
from
head
to
foot
then
he
understood
and
a
great
idea
popped
into
his
head
if
only
he
could
have
a
brown
coat
in
summer
and
a
white
coat
in
winter
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
take
care
of
himself
he
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
finally
he
screwed
up
his
courage
and
went
to
old
mother
nature
he
told
her
all
about
how
he
had
learned
to
sit
tight
when
he
was
seen
but
that
it
did
always
succeed
when
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
then
he
told
her
how
lynx
and
wolf
had
run
right
past
him
the
time
he
was
covered
with
snow
very
timidly
he
asked
old
mother
nature
if
she
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
have
a
white
coat
in
winter
old
mother
nature
said
that
she
would
think
about
it
it
was
almost
the
end
of
winter
then
and
he
heard
nothing
from
old
mother
nature
with
the
coming
of
summer
he
quite
forgot
his
request
but
old
mother
nature
did
she
kept
an
eye
on
hare
and
she
saw
how
timid
he
was
and
how
he
was
in
constant
danger
from
his
hungry
neighbors
with
the
beginning
of
the
next
winter
hare
discovered
one
day
that
his
coat
was
turning
white
he
watched
it
day
by
day
and
saw
it
grow
whiter
and
whiter
until
it
was
as
white
as
the
snow
itself
then
he
knew
that
old
mother
nature
had
not
forgotten
his
request
and
at
once
hastened
to
thank
her
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
hares
have
had
brown
coats
in
summer
and
white
coats
in
winter
concluded
grandfather
frog
oh
thank
you
grandfather
frog
cried
peter
with
a
little
sigh
of
contentment
i
i
wish
i
could
catch
a
foolish
green
fly
for
i
take
the
will
for
the
deed
peter
replied
grandfather
frog
and
he
suddenly
snapped
up
a
foolish
green
fly
that
flew
too
near
xii
when
swift
first
used
a
chimney
all
his
feathered
friends
and
neighbors
there
was
none
whom
peter
rabbit
enjoyed
watching
more
than
he
did
sooty
the
chimney
swift
there
were
two
very
good
reasons
why
peter
enjoyed
watching
sooty
in
the
first
place
sooty
always
appeared
to
be
having
the
very
best
of
good
times
and
you
know
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
watch
any
one
having
a
good
time
ol
mistah
buzzard
sailing
and
sailing
high
in
the
sky
with
only
an
occasional
movement
of
his
great
wings
always
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
and
so
did
skimmer
the
swallow
skimming
just
above
the
tall
grass
of
the
green
meadows
or
wheeling
gracefully
high
in
the
air
but
neither
these
two
nor
any
other
bird
ever
seemed
to
peter
to
be
getting
so
much
real
fun
out
of
flying
as
sooty
the
swift
just
to
hear
him
shout
as
he
raced
with
swiftly
beating
wings
and
then
glided
in
a
short
half
circle
was
enough
to
make
you
want
to
fly
yourself
thought
peter
the
second
reason
why
peter
enjoyed
watching
sooty
was
that
he
was
very
much
a
bird
of
mystery
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
peter
saw
him
every
day
through
the
long
summer
you
know
we
all
enjoy
anything
that
is
mysterious
to
peter
there
was
no
end
of
mystery
about
sooty
the
swift
he
was
not
like
other
birds
in
the
first
place
he
hardly
looked
like
a
bird
at
all
his
tail
was
so
short
that
it
was
hardly
worth
calling
a
tail
his
neck
was
so
short
that
his
head
seemed
a
part
of
his
body
and
then
in
all
the
time
he
had
known
him
peter
never
had
seen
sooty
still
for
a
single
instant
ol
mistah
buzzard
would
come
down
from
high
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
and
sit
for
hours
on
a
dead
tree
in
the
green
forest
or
walk
about
on
the
ground
skimmer
the
swallow
would
sit
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
on
the
very
top
of
farmer
brown
barn
and
twitter
sociably
but
sooty
the
swift
was
always
in
the
air
at
least
he
always
was
whenever
peter
saw
him
sometimes
peter
used
to
wonder
if
sooty
slept
in
the
air
as
ducks
sleep
on
the
water
of
course
he
did
really
think
that
he
did
but
never
seeing
him
anywhere
but
in
the
air
he
was
ready
to
believe
almost
anything
then
one
evening
just
at
dusk
peter
happened
to
be
over
in
the
old
orchard
close
by
farmer
brown
house
and
he
saw
something
that
puzzled
him
more
than
ever
he
saw
sooty
the
swift
right
above
the
chimney
on
farmer
brown
house
it
seemed
to
peter
as
if
something
happened
to
sooty
he
beat
his
wings
in
a
queer
way
but
instead
of
flying
on
he
dropped
right
straight
down
down
down
and
disappeared
he
had
fallen
down
that
chimney
peter
waited
a
long
time
but
sooty
did
appear
again
and
finally
peter
went
home
with
the
feeling
that
he
never
again
would
see
sooty
but
he
did
see
him
again
he
saw
him
the
very
next
day
flying
and
shouting
and
seemingly
having
just
as
good
a
time
as
ever
it
was
then
that
peter
curiosity
would
no
longer
be
denied
he
headed
straight
for
the
smiling
pool
to
consult
grandfather
frog
he
know
all
about
sooty
if
anybody
does
thought
peter
and
hurried
as
fast
as
he
could
grandfather
frog
was
in
his
usual
place
on
his
big
green
one
glance
told
peter
that
grandfather
frog
was
in
the
best
of
humor
so
he
wasted
no
time
grandfather
frog
cried
peter
before
he
was
fairly
on
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
i
saw
something
queer
last
night
and
you
are
the
only
one
i
know
of
who
can
tell
me
what
it
meant
because
you
are
the
only
one
i
know
who
knows
all
about
grandfather
frog
smiled
it
was
a
great
big
broad
smile
it
pleased
him
to
have
peter
say
that
he
knew
everything
not
everything
peter
i
do
know
everything
nobody
does
said
he
but
if
i
happen
to
know
what
you
want
to
know
i
be
glad
to
tell
you
now
what
is
it
that
is
on
your
mind
peter
at
once
plunged
into
his
story
he
told
grandfather
frog
how
much
he
enjoyed
watching
sooty
fly
and
how
little
he
knew
about
sooty
he
wound
up
by
telling
how
he
had
seen
sooty
fall
down
that
chimney
and
how
surprised
he
had
been
to
see
sooty
about
the
next
day
as
well
and
happy
as
ever
he
called
sooty
a
swallow
for
that
is
what
peter
thought
that
sooty
was
he
always
had
thought
so
when
peter
had
finished
grandfather
frog
chuckled
it
was
a
long
deep
chuckle
that
seemed
to
come
clear
from
his
toes
when
he
had
enjoyed
his
chuckle
to
his
heart
content
he
looked
up
at
peter
and
blinked
his
great
goggly
eyes
what
would
you
say
peter
if
i
should
tell
you
that
sooty
is
a
member
of
the
swallow
family
at
all
he
asked
i
believe
you
replied
peter
promptly
but
i
never
again
would
dare
guess
what
family
anybody
belonged
to
from
his
well
sooty
is
a
swallow
at
all
said
grandfather
frog
slowly
he
is
a
swift
which
is
another
family
altogether
furthermore
he
fall
down
that
chimney
no
sir
he
did
fall
down
that
chimney
he
flew
down
and
he
did
it
because
he
lives
there
now
listen
and
tell
you
a
peter
needed
no
second
invitation
a
story
from
grandfather
frog
is
always
one
of
peter
greatest
treats
as
you
know
began
grandfather
frog
as
he
always
does
when
old
mother
nature
first
peopled
the
great
world
she
made
each
bird
a
little
different
from
every
other
bird
and
each
animal
a
little
different
from
every
other
animal
then
she
turned
them
loose
to
make
their
way
the
best
they
could
and
let
them
alone
to
test
them
and
see
how
each
would
make
the
best
of
his
advantages
mr
swift
the
of
sooty
felt
at
first
as
if
old
mother
nature
had
forgotten
to
give
him
any
advantages
at
all
he
was
homely
there
was
so
much
as
a
single
bright
feather
in
his
whole
coat
he
had
a
tail
which
might
as
well
have
been
no
tail
at
all
so
far
as
he
could
see
he
had
tiny
feet
on
which
he
could
walk
at
all
and
with
which
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hang
on
to
a
twig
when
he
wanted
to
rest
but
when
it
came
to
wings
he
was
long
in
discovering
that
in
these
he
was
blessed
beyond
most
of
his
neighbors
those
wings
certainly
were
made
for
speed
they
were
long
and
narrow
and
they
drove
him
through
the
air
faster
than
his
neighbors
with
broader
wings
could
fly
and
with
a
great
deal
less
effort
he
could
fly
all
day
without
getting
tired
and
he
never
was
so
happy
as
when
darting
about
high
in
the
air
of
course
it
did
take
him
long
to
find
out
that
he
could
catch
all
kinds
of
flying
insects
and
so
he
had
no
trouble
in
filling
his
stomach
while
flying
for
his
mouth
was
very
wide
must
be
thought
he
old
mother
nature
expects
me
to
live
in
the
air
i
wish
i
could
sleep
while
i
am
flying
but
i
ca
i
never
feel
comfortable
sitting
on
a
twig
one
day
he
discovered
that
he
could
do
something
that
no
other
bird
could
do
by
using
his
wings
in
a
certain
way
he
could
drop
right
straight
down
without
really
falling
he
practised
this
a
great
deal
just
for
fun
then
one
day
as
he
was
flying
over
a
rocky
place
he
saw
right
under
him
a
great
hole
that
went
straight
down
into
the
ground
it
interested
him
he
wondered
what
it
was
like
inside
the
more
he
wondered
the
more
he
wanted
to
find
out
so
one
day
after
many
trials
he
dropped
straight
down
into
the
hole
by
means
of
that
new
way
of
flying
he
had
discovered
he
did
go
very
far
down
because
it
was
so
dark
in
there
and
he
was
beginning
to
get
a
wee
bit
frightened
on
his
way
up
he
brushed
against
the
side
of
the
rocky
wall
and
without
knowing
why
he
put
out
both
feet
and
clung
to
it
folding
his
wings
for
a
minute
rest
then
he
found
that
by
pressing
his
funny
little
tail
which
ended
in
sharp
spines
against
the
wall
he
rested
more
comfortably
than
ever
he
had
before
in
all
his
short
life
he
could
cling
to
a
rough
wall
very
much
easier
than
he
could
sit
on
a
perch
after
that
he
spent
his
nights
in
that
hole
and
was
happy
a
long
time
later
he
was
far
from
home
when
night
was
coming
on
and
he
knew
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
there
before
dark
looking
down
as
he
flew
he
saw
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
great
tree
which
had
been
broken
off
by
the
wind
why
not
sleep
in
that
he
circled
over
it
two
or
three
times
and
then
dropped
straight
down
inside
he
liked
it
he
liked
it
better
than
he
did
the
hole
in
the
rocks
after
that
he
made
his
home
in
a
hollow
tree
in
course
of
time
old
king
eagle
led
the
birds
to
a
new
part
of
the
great
world
which
old
mother
nature
had
been
preparing
for
them
to
spend
the
summer
in
mr
swift
went
with
the
others
but
when
he
got
there
he
could
find
no
hole
in
the
ground
and
no
hollow
tree
but
he
found
something
else
he
found
the
queer
homes
of
men
and
on
top
of
each
a
straight
tall
thing
quite
like
a
hollow
tree
only
all
black
inside
and
made
of
what
seemed
like
stone
having
no
other
place
to
go
he
tried
one
of
them
the
next
day
he
searched
for
a
hollow
tree
but
could
find
none
and
so
returned
to
that
chimney
for
that
is
what
it
was
so
it
was
every
day
after
a
little
he
began
to
like
the
chimney
it
was
easy
to
get
in
and
out
of
no
one
ever
bothered
him
there
it
was
easy
to
cling
to
the
wall
of
it
at
last
he
decided
to
build
a
nest
there
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
swifts
have
lived
in
the
chimneys
on
the
houses
of
men
when
you
thought
you
saw
sooty
fall
he
was
simply
going
home
to
spend
the
night
concluded
grandfather
frog
thank
you
replied
peter
with
a
long
sigh
it
a
funny
world
it
grandfather
frog
the
idea
of
living
in
a
chimney
the
very
idea
xiii
when
peter
rabbit
first
met
bluffer
the
adder
down
the
crooked
little
path
went
peter
rabbit
in
his
usual
heedless
careless
way
peter
never
can
seem
to
get
it
into
his
funny
little
head
why
he
should
be
careful
when
there
appears
to
be
no
particular
reason
for
being
careful
he
is
like
a
great
many
people
careful
when
he
knows
that
there
is
danger
near
but
as
heedless
as
you
please
when
he
thinks
that
all
is
safe
he
has
got
to
see
or
hear
danger
before
he
will
believe
that
it
is
near
like
a
lot
of
other
folks
he
has
yet
to
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
the
only
way
to
keep
out
of
trouble
is
to
be
always
prepared
for
trouble
so
peter
hopped
and
skipped
down
the
crooked
little
path
as
he
had
a
thousand
times
before
without
a
thought
of
danger
nothing
ever
had
happened
to
him
on
the
crooked
little
path
and
so
he
thought
nothing
ever
could
suddenly
as
he
rounded
a
little
turn
there
was
a
sound
that
made
peter
stop
so
suddenly
that
he
almost
fell
over
backward
a
sound
that
made
every
hair
on
his
body
stand
on
end
and
his
eyes
pop
out
with
fright
it
was
a
hiss
the
loudest
most
awful
hiss
he
ever
had
heard
for
just
a
second
peter
was
too
frightened
to
move
there
coiled
up
right
in
the
crooked
little
path
was
a
member
of
the
snake
family
whom
he
never
had
seen
before
and
such
a
fierce
fellow
as
he
was
no
wonder
peter
was
frightened
this
snake
had
the
flattest
head
peter
ever
had
seen
his
body
was
rather
short
and
thick
and
his
neck
was
flattened
in
a
way
that
made
it
appear
very
large
and
gave
to
him
a
very
ugly
and
dangerous
look
as
soon
as
he
could
get
his
wits
together
peter
turned
and
raced
up
the
crooked
little
path
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
take
him
looking
behind
him
he
did
see
in
front
of
him
and
so
he
almost
ran
into
jimmy
skunk
in
fact
he
would
have
if
jimmy
had
cried
hi
there
why
do
you
look
where
you
are
going
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
peter
rabbit
peter
was
so
startled
by
jimmy
that
he
jumped
to
one
side
as
if
he
suddenly
had
stepped
on
something
hot
then
he
saw
who
it
was
oh
jimmy
he
cried
you
must
go
down
the
crooked
little
path
why
not
demanded
jimmy
skunk
staring
at
peter
and
noting
how
frightened
peter
was
because
panted
peter
right
down
there
in
the
middle
of
it
is
one
of
black
snake
cousins
and
i
know
by
his
looks
that
he
is
one
of
the
dangerous
kind
like
buzztail
the
rattler
ugh
i
nearly
ran
into
him
and
he
hissed
enough
to
make
your
hair
rise
he
got
a
terrible
temper
i
would
go
near
him
again
for
the
world
where
are
you
going
jimmy
down
the
crooked
little
path
to
have
a
look
at
this
terrible
fellow
replied
jimmy
over
his
shoulder
perhaps
i
can
teach
him
some
oh
jimmy
do
be
careful
begged
peter
he
really
is
very
terrible
i
know
his
bite
must
be
awful
i
guess
it
is
worse
than
that
of
buzztail
the
rattler
i
would
go
if
i
were
i
not
such
a
fraidy
as
you
peter
replied
jimmy
skunk
and
ambled
on
down
the
crooked
little
path
peter
was
sure
about
it
but
he
thought
he
heard
jimmy
chuckle
that
settled
matters
for
peter
if
jimmy
was
laughing
at
him
for
warning
him
of
danger
he
could
just
go
on
and
get
a
good
fright
it
would
serve
him
right
peter
hesitated
a
minute
then
at
a
safe
distance
he
followed
he
wanted
to
see
jimmy
skunk
when
he
rounded
that
little
turn
in
the
crooked
little
path
and
heard
that
terrible
hiss
jimmy
ambled
along
slowly
for
you
know
he
never
hurries
presently
he
disappeared
around
that
little
turn
and
right
away
peter
heard
that
terrible
hiss
he
expected
to
see
jimmy
come
racing
back
and
he
was
all
ready
to
make
fun
of
him
for
pretending
to
be
so
brave
but
jimmy
come
once
more
peter
beard
that
angry
hiss
and
felt
his
hair
rise
on
end
then
all
was
still
peter
waited
as
long
as
he
could
stand
it
and
then
his
curiosity
got
the
best
of
him
slowly
and
carefully
be
tiptoed
along
until
he
could
see
around
the
turn
in
the
crooked
little
path
what
he
saw
quite
took
his
breath
away
there
sat
jimmy
skunk
looking
down
at
something
stretched
out
at
his
feet
it
was
that
dreadful
snake
on
his
back
and
he
appeared
to
be
quite
dead
jimmy
reached
out
and
poked
him
but
snake
did
move
jimmy
poked
him
some
more
and
still
he
did
move
illustration
oh
jimmy
however
did
you
dare
to
try
to
kill
him
cried
peter
jimmy
looked
back
at
peter
and
grinned
come
on
with
me
and
i
will
tell
you
a
story
said
he
peter
hesitated
but
the
thought
of
a
story
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
followed
jimmy
down
the
crooked
little
path
taking
pains
to
go
around
the
body
of
snake
and
not
very
near
it
at
that
although
he
knew
it
was
silly
and
foolish
to
be
afraid
of
one
who
was
dead
jimmy
did
go
far
he
sat
down
and
waited
for
peter
to
join
him
from
where
they
were
they
could
see
the
body
of
snake
stretched
out
on
its
back
in
the
crooked
little
path
somehow
now
that
he
was
dead
snake
look
so
very
fierce
and
terrible
in
fact
he
did
look
nearly
so
big
as
he
had
when
he
was
alive
peter
was
thinking
of
this
when
his
heart
gave
a
funny
little
jump
he
had
turned
his
head
for
just
a
second
and
now
as
he
looked
back
at
snake
he
felt
that
his
eyes
must
be
playing
him
tricks
for
snake
was
on
his
instead
of
on
his
peter
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
but
jimmy
made
a
sign
to
keep
still
so
peter
kept
still
and
with
popping
eyes
watched
snake
presently
he
saw
snake
head
come
up
a
little
at
a
time
and
then
move
from
side
to
side
as
if
snake
were
looking
to
see
that
the
way
was
clear
slowly
snake
began
to
glide
forward
then
as
if
satisfied
that
no
one
was
watching
he
moved
faster
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
there
and
in
a
moment
he
disappeared
peter
gulped
two
or
three
times
as
if
trying
to
swallow
the
truth
and
then
turned
to
stare
at
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
laughed
right
out
because
peter
looked
so
funny
you
you
did
kill
him
after
all
gasped
peter
no
replied
jimmy
i
did
even
touch
him
until
you
saw
me
poke
him
when
he
lay
there
on
his
peter
looked
quite
as
puzzled
as
he
felt
was
he
just
pretending
to
be
dead
the
way
unc
billy
possum
does
demanded
peter
jimmy
nodded
you
guessed
it
he
replied
but
why
did
he
do
it
persisted
peter
such
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
that
jimmy
just
had
to
laugh
again
because
he
was
afraid
and
tried
to
fool
me
into
thinking
him
dead
so
that
i
would
leave
him
alone
replied
jimmy
afraid
that
fellow
afraid
exclaimed
peter
in
an
unbelieving
tone
of
voice
why
when
i
saw
him
first
he
was
the
most
savage
fellow
that
ever
i
have
once
more
jimmy
laughed
all
in
his
looks
peter
said
he
yes
sir
all
his
fierceness
is
in
his
looks
really
he
is
one
of
the
most
harmless
and
gentle
fellows
in
the
world
he
tried
to
scare
me
just
as
he
frightened
you
and
when
he
found
it
would
work
he
tried
the
other
plan
pretended
that
he
was
dead
no
one
but
old
toad
has
the
least
reason
in
the
world
to
be
afraid
of
him
all
his
fierceness
is
just
pretending
and
that
is
how
he
comes
by
his
name
which
is
bluffer
the
i
surprised
that
you
never
happened
to
meet
him
before
i
believe
some
folks
call
him
the
snake
i
always
like
to
meet
him
just
to
see
him
try
to
scare
me
and
when
he
finds
he
ca
i
do
a
little
pretending
myself
and
give
him
a
little
scare
by
pretending
that
i
am
going
to
fight
him
then
he
always
rolls
over
on
his
back
and
pretends
that
he
is
dead
i
suppose
he
is
chuckling
to
himself
now
because
he
thinks
that
he
fooled
us
the
next
time
you
meet
him
just
show
him
that
you
know
he
is
perfectly
harmless
and
see
how
quickly
he
stop
pretending
that
he
is
so
ugly
and
dangerous
he
learned
that
trick
of
bluffing
from
his
father
and
his
father
learned
it
from
his
father
and
so
on
way
back
to
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
i
would
tell
you
the
story
now
if
i
had
time
but
i
then
you
have
to
do
it
some
other
time
retorted
peter
for
i
shall
give
you
no
peace
until
you
xiv
when
wood
mouse
learned
from
the
birds
rabbit
never
will
forget
the
first
time
that
he
saw
whitefoot
the
wood
mouse
pop
out
of
a
nest
in
a
bush
a
few
feet
above
his
head
it
was
so
much
the
surprise
of
seeing
whitefoot
as
it
was
the
discovery
that
that
nest
was
own
peter
had
seen
that
nest
often
it
was
in
a
bush
just
a
little
above
one
of
peter
favorite
paths
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
always
he
had
supposed
that
it
belonged
to
one
of
his
feathered
friends
he
had
seen
many
such
nests
at
least
he
supposed
he
had
that
was
because
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
look
at
this
one
particularly
he
had
used
his
eyes
if
he
had
he
might
have
seen
that
this
while
very
like
other
nests
he
had
seen
was
different
it
was
different
in
that
it
had
a
roof
yes
sir
this
particular
nest
had
a
roof
and
it
had
a
doorway
a
very
small
doorway
and
this
doorway
was
underneath
a
very
queer
place
for
a
bird
to
make
a
doorway
had
there
been
any
bird
of
his
acquaintance
who
would
build
a
roof
to
a
nest
anyway
all
of
which
goes
to
show
how
easy
it
is
to
see
things
without
really
seeing
them
at
all
it
was
just
at
dusk
that
peter
happened
along
this
particular
little
path
and
saw
whitefoot
the
wood
mouse
pop
out
of
that
nest
hello
exclaimed
peter
what
are
you
doing
up
there
what
business
have
you
in
that
nest
have
you
been
stealing
eggs
no
i
have
been
stealing
eggs
retorted
whitefoot
indignantly
and
if
i
have
any
business
in
this
nest
i
should
like
to
know
who
has
it
my
nest
who
has
a
better
right
in
it
your
nest
exclaimed
peter
why
i
thought
you
lived
in
a
hollow
tree
or
a
hollow
log
or
a
hole
in
the
ground
or
some
such
place
how
long
is
it
since
you
learned
to
build
a
nest
like
a
bird
and
who
taught
you
whitefoot
knew
by
the
tone
of
peter
voice
that
peter
did
believe
a
word
of
what
he
had
been
told
he
looked
very
hard
at
peter
and
in
his
big
soft
black
eyes
was
an
indignant
look
which
peter
could
help
but
see
i
do
care
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
this
is
my
nest
and
i
built
it
said
he
indignantly
at
least
i
built
it
over
he
added
for
whitefoot
is
very
truthful
in
the
winter
i
do
live
in
a
hollow
tree
or
a
hollow
log
or
a
hole
in
the
ground
whichever
is
most
comfortable
but
in
the
warm
weather
i
have
a
summer
home
and
this
is
it
my
family
has
known
how
to
build
such
homes
ever
since
the
days
of
my
when
the
world
was
young
it
was
he
who
learned
the
secret
and
it
has
been
in
our
family
ever
peter
long
ears
stood
straight
up
with
excited
interest
and
curiosity
tell
me
about
it
he
begged
tell
me
how
your
learned
how
to
build
a
nest
like
a
bird
please
tell
me
whitefoot
sat
up
and
daintily
washed
his
pretty
white
hands
i
think
i
will
he
replied
slowly
you
did
believe
me
when
i
said
that
this
nest
is
mine
and
so
i
sure
you
wo
believe
the
story
of
my
i
do
like
telling
stories
to
people
who
but
i
will
believe
it
cried
peter
if
you
say
it
is
true
believe
every
word
of
it
please
tell
me
the
story
whitefoot
oh
please
peter
was
very
much
in
earnest
i
sorry
i
did
believe
you
at
first
when
you
said
that
this
nest
is
yours
but
i
do
now
whitefoot
i
do
now
please
please
tell
me
the
whitefoot
black
eyes
snapped
and
twinkled
he
enjoyed
being
teased
for
that
story
you
see
he
is
such
a
little
fellow
such
a
very
little
fellow
that
his
bigger
neighbors
seldom
take
any
notice
of
him
unless
it
is
to
try
to
catch
him
there
are
several
who
would
be
glad
to
swallow
whitefoot
if
they
could
catch
him
so
being
such
a
little
fellow
he
felt
rather
puffed
up
rather
important
you
know
that
peter
rabbit
should
be
so
interested
and
should
actually
be
begging
him
for
a
story
he
climbed
up
to
a
crotch
in
a
tree
just
a
little
above
head
a
place
where
he
could
watch
out
for
danger
made
himself
comfortable
with
his
back
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
carefully
combed
his
fur
for
whitefoot
is
very
particular
how
he
looks
and
then
began
his
story
always
ever
since
the
world
was
young
mice
have
been
among
the
smallest
of
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
and
because
of
this
they
have
had
to
live
by
their
wits
if
they
would
live
at
all
in
the
beginning
of
things
it
was
not
so
i
have
heard
it
said
because
then
there
was
plenty
for
all
to
eat
and
no
cause
for
the
big
and
strong
to
seek
to
kill
the
small
and
weak
but
when
the
hard
times
came
and
hunger
led
to
the
doing
of
many
dreadful
things
all
of
the
mouse
tribe
found
that
they
were
in
danger
all
the
time
just
as
they
are
my
the
first
of
all
the
wood
mice
chose
the
green
forest
for
his
home
instead
of
the
green
meadows
where
his
cousin
old
meadow
mouse
liked
best
to
live
he
chose
the
green
forest
because
it
was
always
beautiful
there
and
because
among
the
roots
of
the
trees
and
in
the
trees
themselves
there
were
so
many
he
was
very
small
just
as
i
am
and
he
was
very
just
as
you
are
inquired
peter
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
did
say
that
retorted
whitefoot
indignantly
i
never
have
claimed
to
be
very
smart
though
i
been
smart
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
clutches
of
reddy
fox
and
hooty
the
owl
and
all
the
others
who
hunt
me
but
smart
in
the
green
forest
he
had
prepared
for
himself
many
some
were
in
the
ground
some
were
in
holes
in
trees
and
some
were
in
hollow
stumps
and
logs
for
a
while
he
felt
quite
safe
and
easy
in
his
mind
even
when
the
times
had
become
so
hard
and
food
so
scarce
that
night
and
day
some
of
his
big
neighbors
like
lynx
and
fox
and
wolf
and
owl
and
hawk
and
even
old
king
bear
were
sure
to
come
prowling
about
looking
for
little
people
like
himself
you
see
he
had
plenty
to
eat
himself
because
he
had
been
forehanded
and
had
stored
away
seeds
in
some
of
his
and
he
felt
perfectly
safe
because
the
doorways
to
his
were
so
very
small
that
none
of
these
people
could
follow
him
into
them
so
he
used
to
laugh
at
those
who
hunted
him
and
sometimes
would
dodge
into
one
of
his
little
doorways
right
under
their
very
noses
but
one
day
he
saw
old
king
bear
tear
open
an
old
hollow
stump
with
his
great
claws
and
he
knew
that
king
bear
was
looking
for
him
another
day
quite
by
chance
he
happened
to
see
weasel
slip
into
one
of
his
smallest
doorways
and
then
a
great
fear
took
hold
of
grandfather
wood
mouse
his
enemies
knew
now
where
to
look
for
him
and
how
to
get
into
his
they
were
no
longer
safe
must
find
a
new
and
keep
it
a
secret
thought
he
for
many
days
he
went
about
thinking
and
thinking
one
day
he
had
this
very
much
on
his
mind
as
he
watched
catbird
build
a
nest
all
in
a
flash
a
great
idea
came
to
him
if
he
could
have
a
home
in
a
bush
like
that
of
catbird
no
one
ever
ever
would
think
of
looking
for
him
there
birds
can
build
nests
why
ca
i
thought
he
all
that
day
he
watched
the
building
of
catbird
nest
trying
to
see
just
how
each
stick
was
placed
and
how
the
nest
was
lined
with
fine
roots
and
grass
and
strips
of
grapevine
bark
the
next
day
he
hunted
up
some
old
nests
in
bushes
not
too
high
above
the
ground
and
climbed
up
to
them
he
even
pulled
some
of
them
to
pieces
to
see
how
they
were
made
and
then
tried
to
put
them
together
again
believe
i
can
do
it
he
exclaimed
over
and
over
to
himself
believe
i
can
do
it
any
way
it
will
do
no
harm
to
try
no
harm
can
come
of
trying
he
remembered
an
old
nest
in
a
bramble
bush
not
far
from
where
he
lived
this
he
examined
very
carefully
it
would
do
for
a
foundation
then
he
went
to
work
taking
care
to
build
only
when
no
one
was
near
to
discover
his
secret
he
brought
grass
and
fine
roots
and
he
made
that
nest
more
comfortable
than
it
had
been
when
it
was
first
built
then
he
built
a
roof
over
it
so
that
it
would
shelter
him
in
bad
weather
and
to
get
into
it
he
made
a
little
round
doorway
when
it
was
finished
he
was
very
proud
of
it
as
he
had
reason
to
be
he
carried
seeds
into
it
and
then
he
made
it
his
home
for
the
summer
and
way
into
the
fall
of
course
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
looking
for
him
in
what
seemed
like
a
bird
nest
and
many
a
time
he
peeped
out
and
watched
his
hungry
neighbors
walk
right
under
him
without
ever
suspecting
that
he
was
near
of
course
he
taught
his
children
the
secret
of
which
he
had
learned
from
the
birds
and
that
has
been
the
most
precious
secret
in
our
family
ever
since
you
wo
tell
any
one
will
you
peter
he
concluded
anxiously
no
said
peter
i
wo
tell
any
one
of
course
i
wo
it
must
be
nice
to
have
a
sort
of
in
the
summer
he
added
wistfully
it
is
replied
whitefoot
i
just
love
my
summer
with
this
he
climbed
up
to
his
snug
nest
and
the
last
peter
saw
of
him
was
his
long
slim
tail
disappearing
through
the
little
round
doorway
xv
when
hummingbird
got
his
long
bill
i
saw
him
here
i
saw
him
there
and
now
he
is
not
anywhere
he
is
not
there
he
is
not
here
yet
no
one
saw
him
rabbit
did
intend
that
for
any
ears
but
his
own
but
it
never
is
safe
to
talk
out
loud
if
you
want
no
one
else
to
hear
huh
said
a
voice
right
back
of
peter
peter
started
ever
so
little
and
hastily
turned
his
head
but
saw
no
one
huh
said
the
voice
again
huh
are
you
a
poet
peter
rabbit
this
time
peter
turned
wholly
around
in
a
single
jump
staring
up
at
him
from
under
a
was
old
toad
what
a
poet
demanded
peter
a
poet
is
some
one
who
who
say
peter
rabbit
have
you
eaten
something
that
went
to
your
head
old
toad
looked
really
anxious
no
replied
peter
it
went
to
my
stomach
everything
i
eat
goes
to
my
then
it
ca
be
that
you
are
a
real
poet
sighed
old
toad
i
was
a
little
afraid
you
might
be
when
i
overheard
you
just
now
on
the
whole
i
am
rather
glad
peter
it
would
be
so
tiresome
to
have
to
listen
to
you
talking
that
way
by
the
way
who
is
it
that
is
not
there
and
is
not
here
yet
no
one
saw
him
disappear
hummer
the
hummingbird
replied
peter
eagerly
you
see
him
in
one
place
and
before
you
can
get
your
mouth
open
to
speak
he
is
somewhere
else
then
in
a
shake
of
your
tail
he
is
anywhere
at
all
i
mean
he
is
anywhere
in
i
have
any
tail
retorted
old
toad
rather
testily
i
got
rid
of
the
silly
thing
long
ago
as
you
very
well
know
peter
excuse
me
toad
i
did
mean
anything
personal
it
was
just
a
way
of
speaking
to
show
how
quickly
hummer
disappears
i
was
thinking
of
my
own
tail
said
peter
huh
grunted
old
toad
just
as
before
then
you
were
thinking
of
peter
laughed
not
so
very
much
he
replied
still
i
can
shake
it
even
if
there
is
much
of
it
see
he
stood
up
and
twitched
his
funny
little
tail
until
solemn
old
toad
had
to
laugh
in
spite
of
himself
hummer
is
such
a
wonderful
little
fellow
continued
peter
eagerly
he
is
so
tiny
it
does
seem
possible
that
he
can
be
like
other
birds
i
do
feel
really
acquainted
with
him
because
he
is
still
long
enough
for
me
to
more
than
nod
to
that
true
replied
old
toad
nodding
sagely
he
is
still
down
near
the
ground
but
if
you
happened
to
find
his
home
you
would
often
see
him
sitting
near
it
as
still
as
any
other
bird
by
the
way
peter
did
you
ever
hear
how
it
happened
that
he
comes
by
such
a
long
bill
a
story
cried
peter
jumping
up
and
down
and
clapping
his
hands
oh
toad
i
never
did
hear
and
i
just
dying
to
know
please
do
tell
me
there
was
a
twinkle
in
old
toad
beautiful
eyes
for
they
really
are
beautiful
you
know
he
backed
a
little
farther
under
the
big
where
the
sun
could
reach
him
opened
and
closed
his
big
mouth
two
or
three
times
without
making
a
sound
rolled
his
eyes
back
as
if
he
were
looking
way
way
into
the
past
and
then
just
as
peter
had
begun
to
think
that
there
was
going
to
be
any
story
after
all
he
began
to
talk
in
a
funny
little
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
way
down
where
his
throat
and
his
stomach
meet
it
was
long
long
long
ago
said
he
i
know
it
was
way
back
when
the
world
was
young
interrupted
peter
eagerly
oh
so
you
know
the
story
after
all
do
you
grunted
old
toad
rather
crossly
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
indeed
i
sorry
peter
hastened
to
say
very
well
very
well
grumbled
old
toad
but
do
do
it
again
now
i
have
to
begin
all
over
again
it
was
a
long
long
long
time
ago
in
the
beginning
of
things
when
old
mother
nature
had
made
all
the
big
birds
and
the
birds
and
the
little
birds
that
she
discovered
that
she
had
just
a
teeny
weeny
bit
of
the
things
birds
are
made
of
left
over
there
was
enough
to
make
even
the
head
of
an
ordinary
bird
no
bird
had
use
for
another
head
anyway
now
old
mother
nature
never
could
bear
to
waste
anything
and
she
did
intend
to
begin
so
she
made
a
teeny
weeny
bird
and
she
made
him
just
as
perfect
as
any
other
bird
she
gave
him
feathers
just
like
any
other
bird
only
of
course
his
feathers
were
teeny
weeny
she
gave
him
a
tail
just
like
any
other
bird
only
it
was
a
teeny
weeny
tail
she
gave
him
feet
with
toes
and
claws
just
like
any
other
bird
only
they
were
teeny
weeny
feet
and
she
gave
him
a
bill
only
it
was
a
teeny
weeny
bill
and
it
was
short
and
because
he
was
so
teeny
weeny
and
yet
a
perfect
bird
old
mother
nature
was
very
proud
of
him
so
she
gave
him
a
beautiful
green
coat
the
beautiful
ruby
throat
was
not
given
him
until
later
when
he
proved
so
brave
of
heart
and
so
loyal
to
king
eagle
you
i
remember
said
peter
he
got
his
ruby
throat
when
old
king
eagle
won
his
crown
of
when
old
mother
nature
sent
little
hummingbird
out
into
the
great
world
to
join
the
other
birds
she
told
him
that
tiny
as
he
was
she
could
treat
him
no
differently
from
the
others
and
that
he
would
have
to
take
care
of
himself
and
prove
that
he
was
worthy
to
live
and
have
a
place
in
the
work
of
the
great
world
for
that
was
a
law
which
she
could
not
break
for
any
one
great
or
small
so
little
hummingbird
darted
away
to
join
the
other
birds
and
find
a
place
for
himself
in
the
great
world
when
the
other
birds
first
saw
him
they
laughed
at
him
because
he
was
so
tiny
and
made
fun
of
him
though
truth
to
tell
some
of
them
were
envious
because
of
his
beautiful
coat
and
others
were
envious
because
of
the
way
in
which
he
could
dart
about
for
not
one
among
them
could
fly
so
swiftly
as
little
hummingbird
tiny
though
he
was
he
was
stout
of
heart
and
fairly
bursting
with
spunk
he
would
dash
into
the
very
faces
of
those
who
tried
to
tease
him
and
would
be
away
again
before
they
could
so
much
as
strike
at
him
so
it
was
long
before
they
let
him
alone
though
among
themselves
they
still
looked
on
him
as
a
joke
and
were
sure
he
would
not
live
long
being
such
a
teeny
weeny
fellow
of
course
hummingbird
had
a
teeny
weeny
stomach
and
he
soon
discovered
that
he
could
eat
the
things
that
other
birds
did
but
must
hunt
for
teeny
weeny
things
it
take
him
long
to
find
out
that
there
were
many
teeny
weeny
insects
just
suited
to
him
especially
about
the
flowers
so
hummingbird
spent
most
of
his
time
darting
about
among
the
flowers
catching
teeny
weeny
insects
to
fill
his
teeny
weeny
stomach
one
day
he
paused
in
front
of
a
flower
and
discovered
that
many
teeny
weeny
insects
had
hidden
in
the
heart
of
it
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
reach
them
now
his
own
swift
little
wings
were
not
quicker
than
hummingbird
temper
and
he
promptly
pulled
that
flower
to
pieces
then
he
caught
all
the
insects
and
in
doing
this
he
discovered
that
in
the
heart
of
the
flower
were
sweet
juices
better
than
anything
he
ever
had
tasted
before
after
that
he
wasted
no
time
hunting
for
teeny
weeny
insects
in
the
air
but
darted
from
one
flower
to
another
pulling
them
to
pieces
and
filling
his
teeny
weeny
stomach
with
the
insects
hiding
there
and
the
sweet
juices
one
day
along
came
old
mother
nature
to
see
how
things
were
going
on
every
side
were
beautiful
flowers
torn
to
rags
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
dismay
me
she
cried
wonder
who
can
have
been
doing
such
dreadful
mischief
just
then
she
caught
sight
of
little
hummingbird
tearing
another
flower
to
pieces
sternly
she
called
him
before
her
and
he
came
fearlessly
are
you
tearing
my
beautiful
flowers
to
pieces
she
demanded
it
is
the
only
way
i
can
get
the
food
in
the
hearts
of
them
and
it
is
the
food
best
suited
to
me
replied
little
hummingbird
promptly
but
respectfully
old
mother
nature
tried
to
look
severe
but
a
twinkle
crept
into
her
eyes
secretly
she
was
pleased
with
the
fearlessness
of
the
teeny
weeny
bird
may
be
but
i
can
not
have
my
beautiful
flowers
destroyed
this
way
it
will
never
do
at
all
said
she
she
scratched
her
head
thoughtfully
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
reached
out
and
took
hold
of
hummingbird
teeny
weeny
bill
said
she
little
hummingbird
pulled
with
all
his
might
and
his
bill
was
pulled
out
until
it
was
long
and
slender
and
his
tongue
was
pulled
out
long
with
it
said
old
mother
nature
guess
you
wo
have
to
pull
my
flowers
to
pieces
little
hummingbird
darted
away
to
the
nearest
flower
and
found
that
he
could
reach
the
teeny
weeny
insects
and
the
sweet
juices
without
the
least
trouble
and
from
that
time
on
he
took
the
greatest
care
not
to
hurt
the
beautiful
flowers
that
is
how
hummer
whom
you
know
happens
to
have
a
long
bill
concluded
old
toad
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
he
seems
to
love
the
flowers
so
said
peter
as
he
looked
down
at
old
toad
thoughtfully
it
is
replied
old
toad
and
yawned
sleepily
xvi
when
old
mr
bat
got
his
wings
happens
that
the
merry
little
breezes
who
as
you
know
are
the
children
of
old
mother
west
wind
are
quite
as
fond
of
stories
as
is
peter
rabbit
in
fact
whenever
they
suspect
that
peter
is
going
to
ask
some
one
for
a
story
they
manage
to
be
about
so
that
they
may
hear
it
too
now
the
merry
little
breezes
are
very
fond
of
grandfather
frog
and
many
many
times
they
have
helped
him
get
a
good
dinner
by
blowing
foolish
green
flies
within
his
reach
it
was
after
one
of
these
times
that
grandfather
frog
promised
them
a
story
now
the
merry
little
breezes
did
not
intend
to
let
grandfather
frog
forget
that
promise
so
one
afternoon
when
they
had
grown
tired
of
romping
on
the
green
meadows
they
danced
over
to
the
smiling
pool
and
settled
around
the
big
green
on
which
grandfather
frog
was
dozing
all
together
they
shouted
we
know
you
old
we
know
you
wise
and
what
you
say
we
dearly
prize
so
tell
a
tale
of
olden
days
and
then
mayhap
we
go
our
what
shall
it
be
about
demanded
grandfather
frog
waking
up
quite
tell
us
why
flitter
the
bat
can
fly
when
none
of
the
other
animals
can
cried
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
grandfather
frog
cleared
his
throat
several
times
and
then
he
began
and
this
is
the
story
he
told
once
upon
a
time
when
the
world
was
young
old
mr
bat
the
many
times
of
flitter
whom
you
all
know
lived
in
a
cave
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
old
mr
bat
was
little
quite
as
little
as
flitter
is
now
he
did
have
any
wings
then
no
sir
old
mr
bat
had
no
wings
now
old
mr
bat
teeth
were
small
and
not
made
for
cracking
hard
seeds
and
things
of
that
sort
so
he
lived
mostly
on
insects
he
used
to
hunt
for
them
under
sticks
and
stones
sometimes
he
had
hard
work
to
find
enough
for
a
meal
because
you
know
so
many
other
green
forest
people
were
hunting
for
them
too
now
old
mr
bat
eyes
were
very
small
very
very
small
indeed
and
the
bright
sun
hurt
them
so
old
mr
bat
used
to
stay
in
his
cave
all
day
and
hunt
for
his
meals
only
after
jolly
sun
had
gone
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
when
he
did
come
out
most
of
the
crawling
bugs
had
been
caught
by
others
and
it
was
hard
work
finding
them
so
often
mr
bat
went
hungry
one
evening
old
mr
bat
noticed
that
at
twilight
a
great
many
bugs
fly
about
he
sat
on
a
big
stone
at
the
mouth
of
his
cave
and
watched
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
was
full
of
bugs
by
and
by
a
big
fat
fellow
came
so
near
that
old
mr
bat
forgot
where
he
was
and
jumped
for
him
jumped
right
off
the
top
of
the
big
stone
of
course
he
got
a
hard
tumble
but
he
did
mind
it
a
bit
not
a
bit
for
he
had
caught
the
bug
after
that
old
mr
bat
used
to
spend
most
of
the
time
he
was
awake
jumping
for
flying
bugs
one
night
he
made
a
very
long
jump
from
a
high
stone
and
got
such
a
fall
that
all
the
breath
was
knocked
out
of
his
funny
little
body
when
he
had
gotten
his
breath
back
he
discovered
that
some
one
was
looking
down
and
smiling
at
him
it
was
old
mother
nature
hard
work
to
get
a
dinner
that
way
is
it
mr
bat
asked
old
mother
nature
mr
bat
allowed
that
it
was
would
you
like
to
fly
asked
old
mother
nature
mr
bat
thought
that
that
would
be
very
fine
indeed
but
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
because
as
you
know
he
had
any
wings
old
mother
nature
said
no
more
but
something
seemed
to
be
pleasing
her
greatly
as
she
left
mr
bat
the
next
evening
when
old
mr
bat
awoke
he
really
did
know
whether
he
was
himself
or
not
no
sir
he
did
his
legs
were
much
longer
than
they
used
to
be
and
really
of
no
use
at
all
for
walking
between
them
was
a
queer
thin
skin
he
could
run
he
could
even
crawl
very
well
at
last
after
much
work
he
managed
to
get
to
the
top
of
a
big
rock
he
was
very
hungry
and
when
a
big
fat
bug
came
along
he
forgot
all
about
his
troubles
and
tried
to
jump
but
instead
of
jumping
as
he
always
had
he
just
tumbled
off
the
big
rock
as
he
fell
he
spread
out
his
legs
what
do
you
think
happened
why
old
mr
bat
found
that
he
could
fly
and
ever
since
that
time
the
bats
have
lived
in
dark
caves
and
have
been
able
to
fly
concluded
grandfather
frog
splendid
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
and
we
thank
you
ever
and
ever
so
much
then
they
had
a
race
to
see
who
could
be
the
first
to
blow
a
foolish
green
fly
over
to
grandfather
frog
the
end
