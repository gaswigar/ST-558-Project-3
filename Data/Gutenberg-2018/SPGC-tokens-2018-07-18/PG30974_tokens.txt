rabbits
jimbo
governess
ought
to
have
known
better
but
she
did
if
she
had
jimbo
would
never
have
met
with
the
adventures
that
subsequently
came
to
him
thus
in
a
roundabout
sort
of
way
the
child
ought
to
have
been
thankful
to
the
governess
and
perhaps
in
a
roundabout
sort
of
way
he
was
but
that
comes
at
the
far
end
of
the
story
and
is
doubtful
at
best
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
child
had
gone
through
his
suffering
and
the
governess
had
in
some
measure
expiated
her
fault
so
that
at
this
stage
it
is
only
necessary
to
note
that
the
whole
business
began
because
the
empty
house
happened
to
be
really
an
empty
house
not
the
one
jimbo
family
lived
in
but
another
of
which
more
will
be
known
in
due
course
jimbo
father
was
a
retired
colonel
who
had
married
late
in
life
and
now
lived
all
the
year
round
in
the
country
and
jimbo
was
the
youngest
child
but
one
the
colonel
lean
in
body
as
he
was
sincere
in
mind
an
excellent
soldier
but
a
poor
diplomatist
loved
dogs
horses
guns
and
he
also
really
understood
them
his
neighbours
had
they
been
asked
would
have
called
him
and
so
far
as
a
man
may
deserve
the
title
he
probably
was
he
rode
two
horses
a
day
to
hounds
with
the
best
of
them
and
the
stiffer
the
country
the
better
he
liked
it
besides
his
guns
dogs
and
horses
he
was
also
very
fond
of
his
children
it
was
his
hobby
that
he
understood
them
far
better
than
his
wife
did
or
than
any
one
else
did
for
that
matter
the
proper
evolution
of
their
differing
temperaments
had
no
difficulties
for
him
the
delicate
problems
of
which
defy
solution
by
nine
parents
out
of
ten
ceased
to
exist
the
moment
he
spread
out
his
muscular
hand
in
a
favourite
omnipotent
gesture
and
uttered
some
extraordinarily
foolish
generality
in
that
thunderous
voice
of
his
the
difficulty
for
himself
vanished
when
he
ended
up
with
the
words
leave
that
to
me
my
dear
believe
me
i
know
best
but
for
all
else
concerned
and
especially
for
the
child
under
discussion
this
was
when
the
difficulty
really
began
since
however
the
colonel
after
this
chapter
mounts
his
best
hunter
and
disappears
over
a
high
hedge
into
space
so
far
as
our
story
is
concerned
any
further
delineation
of
his
wholesome
but
very
ordinary
type
is
unnecessary
one
winter
evening
not
very
long
after
christmas
the
colonel
made
a
discovery
it
alarmed
him
a
little
for
it
suggested
to
his
cocksure
mind
that
he
did
not
understand
his
children
as
comprehensively
as
he
imagined
between
five
tea
and
dinner
that
magic
hour
when
lessons
were
over
and
the
big
house
was
full
of
shadows
and
mystery
there
came
a
timid
knock
at
the
study
door
come
in
growled
the
soldier
in
his
deepest
voice
and
a
little
face
wreathed
in
tumbling
brown
hair
poked
itself
hesitatingly
through
the
opening
the
colonel
did
not
like
being
disturbed
at
this
hour
and
everybody
in
the
house
knew
it
but
the
spell
of
christmas
holidays
was
still
somehow
in
the
air
and
the
customary
order
was
not
yet
fully
moreover
when
he
saw
who
the
intruder
was
his
growl
modified
itself
into
a
sort
of
common
sternness
that
yet
was
not
cleverly
enough
simulated
to
deceive
the
really
intuitive
little
person
who
now
stood
inside
the
room
well
nixie
child
what
do
you
want
now
please
father
will
you
we
wondered
if
a
chorus
of
whispers
issued
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
go
on
silly
out
with
it
you
promised
you
would
nixie
if
you
would
come
and
play
rabbits
with
us
came
the
words
in
a
desperate
rush
with
laughter
not
far
behind
the
big
man
with
the
fierce
white
moustaches
glared
over
the
top
of
his
glasses
at
the
intruders
as
if
amazed
beyond
belief
at
the
audacity
of
the
request
rabbits
he
exclaimed
as
though
the
mere
word
ought
to
have
caused
an
instant
explosion
rabbits
oh
do
rabbits
at
this
time
of
night
he
repeated
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
why
all
good
rabbits
are
asleep
in
their
holes
by
now
and
you
ought
to
be
in
yours
too
by
rights
i
sure
we
do
sleep
in
holes
father
said
the
owner
of
the
brown
hair
who
was
acting
as
leader
and
there
still
a
nour
before
bedtime
added
a
voice
in
the
rear
the
big
man
slowly
put
his
glasses
down
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
looked
very
savage
but
of
course
it
was
all
pretence
and
the
children
knew
it
if
he
was
cross
he
pretend
to
be
nice
they
whispered
to
each
other
with
merciless
perception
well
he
began
but
he
who
hesitates
with
children
is
lost
the
door
flung
open
wide
and
the
troop
poured
into
the
room
in
a
medley
of
long
black
legs
flying
hair
and
outstretched
hands
they
surrounded
the
table
swarmed
upon
his
big
knees
shut
his
stupid
old
book
tried
on
his
glasses
kissed
him
and
fell
to
discussing
the
game
breathlessly
all
at
once
as
though
it
had
already
begun
this
of
course
ended
the
battle
and
the
big
man
had
to
play
the
part
of
the
monster
rabbit
in
a
wonderful
game
of
his
own
invention
but
when
at
length
it
was
all
over
and
they
were
gathered
panting
round
the
fire
of
blazing
logs
in
the
hall
the
monster
rabbit
the
only
one
with
any
breath
at
his
command
looked
up
and
spoke
where
jimbo
he
asked
upstairs
why
did
he
come
and
play
too
he
did
want
to
why
what
he
doing
several
answers
were
forthcoming
nothing
in
talking
to
the
furniture
when
i
last
saw
him
just
thinking
as
usual
or
staring
in
the
fire
none
of
the
answers
seemed
to
satisfy
the
monster
rabbit
for
when
he
kissed
them
a
little
later
and
said
he
gave
orders
with
a
graver
face
for
jimbo
to
be
sent
down
to
the
study
before
he
went
to
bed
moreover
he
called
him
james
which
was
a
sure
sign
of
parental
displeasure
james
why
did
you
come
and
play
with
your
brothers
and
sisters
just
now
asked
the
colonel
as
a
boy
of
about
eight
with
a
mop
of
dark
hair
and
a
wistful
expression
came
slowly
forward
into
the
room
i
was
in
the
middle
of
making
pictures
where
what
making
pictures
in
the
fire
james
said
the
colonel
in
a
serious
tone
do
you
know
that
you
are
getting
too
old
now
for
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
dream
so
much
you
fall
asleep
altogether
some
fine
day
and
never
wake
up
again
just
think
what
that
means
the
child
smiled
faintly
and
moved
up
confidingly
between
his
knees
staring
into
his
eyes
without
the
least
sign
of
fear
but
he
said
nothing
in
reply
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
effort
to
bring
them
back
into
the
study
and
to
a
consideration
of
his
father
words
was
almost
beyond
his
power
you
must
run
about
more
pursued
the
soldier
rubbing
his
big
hands
together
briskly
and
join
your
brothers
and
sisters
in
their
games
lie
about
in
the
summer
and
dream
a
bit
if
you
like
but
now
winter
you
must
be
more
active
and
make
your
blood
circulate
healthily
er
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
words
were
kindly
spoken
but
the
voice
and
manner
rather
deliberate
jimbo
began
to
look
a
little
troubled
as
his
father
watched
him
come
now
little
man
he
said
more
gently
what
the
matter
eh
he
drew
the
boy
close
to
him
tell
me
all
about
it
and
what
it
is
you
always
thinking
about
so
much
jimbo
brought
back
his
mind
with
a
tremendous
effort
and
said
i
like
the
winter
it
so
dark
and
full
of
horrid
things
it
all
ice
and
shadows
so
so
i
go
away
and
think
of
what
i
like
and
other
places
nonsense
interrupted
his
father
briskly
winter
a
capital
time
for
boys
what
in
the
world
d
mean
i
wonder
he
lifted
the
child
on
to
his
knee
and
stroked
his
hair
as
though
he
were
patting
the
flank
of
a
horse
jimbo
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
or
of
the
caress
but
went
on
saying
what
he
had
to
say
though
with
eyes
a
little
more
clouded
winter
like
going
into
a
long
black
tunnel
you
see
it
downhill
to
christmas
of
course
and
then
uphill
all
the
way
to
the
summer
holidays
but
the
uphill
part
so
slow
that
tut
tut
laughed
the
colonel
in
spite
of
himself
you
must
have
such
thoughts
those
are
a
baby
notions
they
silly
silly
silly
do
you
think
so
father
continued
the
boy
as
if
politeness
demanded
some
recognition
of
his
father
remarks
but
otherwise
anxious
only
to
say
what
was
in
his
mind
you
would
think
them
silly
if
you
really
knew
but
of
course
there
no
one
to
tell
you
in
the
stable
so
you
know
you
never
seen
the
funny
big
people
rushing
past
you
and
laughing
through
their
long
hair
when
the
wind
blows
so
loud
know
several
of
them
almost
to
speak
to
but
you
hear
only
wind
and
the
other
things
with
tiny
legs
that
skate
up
and
down
the
slippery
moonbeams
without
ever
tumbling
off
they
are
silly
a
bit
only
they
do
like
dogs
and
noise
and
i
seen
the
furniture
he
pronounced
it
furchinur
dancing
about
in
the
when
it
thought
it
was
alone
and
i
heard
it
talking
at
night
i
know
the
big
voice
quite
well
it
just
like
a
drum
only
rougher
the
colonel
shook
his
head
and
frowned
severely
staring
hard
at
his
son
but
though
their
eyes
met
the
boy
hardly
saw
him
far
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
dark
tunnel
of
the
months
he
saw
the
white
summer
sunshine
lying
over
gardens
full
of
nodding
flowers
butterflies
were
flitting
across
meadows
yellow
with
buttercups
and
he
saw
the
fascinating
rings
upon
the
lawn
where
the
fairy
people
held
their
dances
in
the
moonlight
he
heard
the
wind
call
to
him
as
it
ran
on
along
by
the
hedgerows
and
saw
the
gentle
pressure
of
its
swift
feet
upon
the
standing
hay
streams
were
murmuring
under
shady
trees
birds
were
singing
and
there
were
echoes
of
sweeter
music
still
that
he
could
not
understand
but
loved
all
the
more
perhaps
on
that
account
yes
announced
the
colonel
later
that
evening
to
his
wife
spreading
his
hands
out
as
he
spoke
yes
my
dear
i
made
a
discovery
and
an
alarming
one
you
know
i
rarely
at
fault
where
the
children
are
concerned
and
i
noted
all
the
symptoms
with
unusual
care
james
my
dear
is
an
imaginative
boy
he
paused
to
note
the
effect
of
his
words
but
seeing
none
continued
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
say
it
but
it
a
fact
beyond
dispute
his
head
is
simply
full
of
things
and
he
talked
to
me
this
evening
about
tunnels
and
slippery
moonlight
till
i
very
nearly
lost
my
temper
altogether
now
the
boy
will
never
make
a
man
unless
we
take
him
in
hand
properly
at
once
we
must
get
him
a
governess
or
something
without
delay
just
fancy
if
he
grew
up
into
a
poet
or
one
of
these
these
in
his
distress
the
soldier
could
only
think
of
which
did
not
seem
quite
the
right
language
he
stuck
altogether
and
kept
repeating
the
favourite
gesture
with
his
open
hand
staring
at
his
wife
over
his
glasses
as
he
did
so
but
the
mother
never
argued
he
very
young
still
she
observed
quietly
and
as
you
have
always
said
he
not
a
bit
like
other
boys
remember
exactly
what
i
say
now
that
your
eyes
are
opened
to
the
actual
state
of
affairs
i
satisfied
we
get
a
sensible
at
once
added
the
mother
a
practical
one
yes
dear
yes
and
well
educated
yes
and
er
firm
with
children
she
do
for
the
lot
then
if
possible
and
a
young
woman
who
does
go
in
for
poetry
and
dreaming
and
all
that
kind
of
flummery
of
course
dear
capital
i
felt
sure
you
would
agree
with
me
he
went
on
it
be
no
end
of
a
pity
if
jimbo
grew
up
an
ass
at
present
he
hardly
knows
the
difference
between
a
roadster
and
a
racer
he
going
into
the
army
too
he
added
by
way
of
climax
and
you
know
my
dear
the
army
would
never
stand
never
said
the
mother
quietly
and
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
meanwhile
the
subject
of
these
remarks
was
lying
wide
awake
upstairs
in
the
bed
with
the
yellow
iron
railing
round
it
his
elder
brother
was
asleep
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
snoring
peacefully
he
could
just
see
the
brass
knobs
of
the
bedstead
as
the
dying
firelight
quivered
and
shone
on
them
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
draped
in
shadows
that
altered
their
shapes
from
time
to
time
as
the
coals
dropped
softly
into
the
grate
gradually
the
fire
sank
and
the
room
darkened
a
feeling
of
delight
and
awe
stole
into
his
heart
jimbo
loved
these
early
hours
of
the
night
before
sleep
came
he
felt
no
fear
of
the
dark
its
mystery
thrilled
his
soul
but
he
liked
the
summer
dark
with
its
soft
warm
silences
better
than
the
chill
winter
shadows
presently
the
firelight
sprang
up
into
a
brief
flame
and
then
died
away
altogether
with
an
odd
little
gulp
he
knew
the
sound
well
he
often
watched
the
fire
out
and
now
as
he
lay
in
bed
waiting
for
he
knew
not
what
the
moonlight
filtered
in
through
the
baize
curtains
and
gradually
gave
to
the
room
a
wholly
new
character
jimbo
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
the
house
was
very
still
he
slipped
into
his
red
and
crept
noiselessly
over
to
the
window
for
a
moment
he
paused
by
his
brother
bed
to
make
sure
that
he
really
was
asleep
then
evidently
satisfied
he
drew
aside
a
corner
of
the
curtain
and
peered
out
oh
he
said
drawing
in
his
breath
with
delight
and
again
oh
it
was
difficult
to
understand
why
the
sea
of
white
moonlight
that
covered
the
lawn
should
fill
him
with
such
joy
and
at
the
same
time
bring
a
lump
into
his
throat
it
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
swelling
out
into
something
very
much
greater
than
the
actual
limits
of
his
little
person
and
the
sensation
was
one
of
mingled
pain
and
delight
too
intense
for
him
to
feel
for
very
long
the
unhappiness
passed
gradually
away
he
always
noticed
and
the
happiness
merged
after
a
while
into
a
sort
of
dreamy
ecstasy
in
which
he
neither
thought
nor
wished
much
but
was
conscious
only
of
one
single
unmanageable
yearning
the
huge
cedars
on
the
lawn
reared
themselves
up
like
giants
in
silver
cloaks
and
the
the
umbrella
tree
as
the
children
called
it
loomed
with
motionless
branches
that
were
frosted
and
shining
beyond
it
in
a
blue
mist
of
moonlight
and
distance
lay
the
he
could
just
make
out
the
line
of
the
high
wall
where
the
grew
immediately
below
him
the
gravel
of
the
carriage
drive
sparkled
with
frost
the
bars
of
the
windows
were
cold
to
his
hands
yet
he
stood
there
for
a
long
time
with
his
nose
flattened
against
the
pane
and
his
bare
feet
on
the
cane
chair
he
felt
both
happy
and
sad
his
heart
longed
dreadfully
for
something
he
had
not
got
something
that
seemed
out
of
his
reach
because
he
could
not
name
it
no
one
seemed
to
believe
all
the
things
he
in
quite
the
same
way
as
he
did
his
brothers
and
sisters
played
up
to
a
certain
point
and
then
put
the
things
aside
as
if
they
had
only
been
assumed
for
the
time
and
were
not
real
to
him
they
were
always
real
his
father
words
too
that
evening
had
sorely
puzzled
him
when
he
came
to
think
over
them
afterwards
they
a
baby
notions
they
silly
silly
silly
were
these
things
real
or
were
they
not
and
as
he
pondered
yearning
dumbly
as
only
these
little
souls
can
yearn
the
wistfulness
in
his
heart
went
out
to
meet
the
moonlight
in
the
air
together
they
wove
a
spell
that
seemed
to
summon
before
him
a
fairy
of
the
night
who
whispered
an
answer
into
his
heart
we
are
real
so
long
as
you
believe
in
us
it
is
your
imagination
that
makes
us
real
and
gives
us
life
please
never
never
stop
believing
jimbo
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
understood
the
message
but
he
liked
it
all
the
same
and
felt
comforted
so
long
as
they
believed
in
one
another
the
rest
did
not
matter
very
much
after
all
and
when
at
last
shivering
with
cold
he
crept
back
to
bed
it
was
only
to
find
through
the
gates
of
sleep
a
more
direct
way
to
the
things
he
had
been
thinking
about
and
to
wander
for
the
rest
of
the
night
unwatched
and
free
through
the
wonders
of
an
enchanted
land
jimbo
as
his
father
had
said
was
an
imaginative
child
most
children
are
more
or
less
and
he
was
more
at
least
more
than
his
brothers
and
sisters
the
colonel
thought
he
had
made
a
penetrating
discovery
but
his
wife
had
known
it
always
his
head
indeed
was
full
of
things
things
that
unless
trained
into
a
channel
where
they
could
be
controlled
and
properly
schooled
would
certainly
interfere
with
his
success
in
a
practical
world
and
be
a
source
of
mingled
pain
and
joy
to
him
all
through
life
to
have
trained
these
forces
ever
bursting
out
towards
creation
in
his
little
soul
to
have
explained
interpreted
and
dealt
fairly
by
them
would
perhaps
have
been
the
best
and
wisest
way
to
have
suppressed
them
altogether
cleaned
them
out
by
the
process
of
substitution
this
might
have
succeeded
too
in
less
measure
but
to
turn
them
into
a
veritable
rout
of
horror
by
the
common
method
of
frightening
the
nonsense
out
of
the
boy
this
was
surely
the
very
worst
way
of
dealing
with
such
a
case
and
the
most
cruel
yet
this
was
the
method
adopted
by
the
colonel
in
the
robust
of
his
heart
and
the
utter
ignorance
of
his
soul
so
it
came
about
that
three
months
later
when
may
was
melting
into
june
miss
ethel
lake
arrived
upon
the
scene
as
a
result
of
the
colonel
blundering
good
intentions
she
brought
with
her
a
kind
disposition
a
supreme
ignorance
of
unordinary
children
a
large
store
of
and
a
corded
yellow
tin
box
chapter
ii
miss
lake
comes
and
goes
the
conversation
took
place
suddenly
one
afternoon
and
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
except
the
two
who
took
part
in
it
the
colonel
asked
the
governess
to
try
and
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
jimbo
head
and
the
governess
promised
eagerly
to
do
her
very
best
it
was
her
first
place
and
by
nonsense
they
both
understood
imagination
true
enough
jimbo
mother
had
given
her
rather
different
instructions
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
boy
but
she
mistook
the
soldier
bluster
for
authority
and
deemed
it
best
to
obey
him
this
was
her
first
mistake
in
reality
she
was
not
devoid
of
imaginative
insight
it
was
simply
that
her
anxiety
to
prove
a
success
permitted
her
better
judgment
to
be
overborne
by
the
colonel
boisterous
manner
the
wisdom
of
the
mother
was
greater
than
that
of
her
husband
for
the
safe
development
of
that
tender
and
imaginative
little
boy
of
hers
she
had
been
at
great
pains
to
engage
a
girl
a
clergyman
daughter
who
possessed
sufficient
sympathy
with
the
poetic
and
dreamy
nature
to
be
of
real
help
to
him
for
true
help
she
knew
can
only
come
from
true
understanding
and
miss
lake
was
a
good
girl
she
was
entirely
which
is
the
beginning
of
and
her
principal
weakness
lay
in
her
judgment
which
led
her
to
obey
the
colonel
too
literally
she
seems
most
sensible
he
declared
to
his
wife
yes
dear
and
practical
i
think
so
and
firm
and
er
wise
with
children
i
hope
so
just
the
sort
for
young
jimbo
added
the
colonel
with
decision
i
trust
so
she
a
little
young
perhaps
possibly
but
one
ca
get
everything
said
her
husband
in
his
voice
a
year
with
her
should
clean
out
that
fanciful
brain
of
his
and
prepare
him
for
school
with
other
boys
he
be
all
right
once
he
gets
to
school
my
dear
he
added
spreading
out
his
right
hand
fingers
extended
you
made
a
most
wise
selection
i
congratulate
you
i
delighted
i
so
glad
capital
i
repeat
capital
you
a
clever
little
woman
i
knew
find
the
right
party
once
i
showed
you
how
the
land
lay
the
empty
house
that
stood
in
its
neglected
garden
not
far
from
the
park
gates
was
built
on
a
point
of
land
that
entered
wedgewise
into
the
colonel
estate
though
something
of
an
eyesore
therefore
he
could
do
nothing
with
it
to
the
children
it
had
always
been
an
object
of
peculiar
though
not
unwholesome
mystery
none
of
them
cared
to
pass
it
on
a
stormy
day
the
wind
made
such
odd
noises
in
its
empty
corridors
and
rooms
and
they
refused
to
go
within
hailing
distance
of
it
after
dark
but
in
jimbo
imagination
it
was
especially
haunted
and
if
he
had
ceased
to
reveal
to
the
others
what
he
went
on
under
its
roof
it
was
only
because
they
were
unable
to
follow
him
and
were
inclined
to
greet
his
extravagant
recitals
with
now
jimbo
you
know
well
you
only
making
up
the
house
had
been
empty
for
many
years
but
to
the
children
it
had
been
empty
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
since
what
they
called
the
beginning
they
believed
well
each
child
believed
according
to
his
own
mind
and
powers
but
there
was
at
least
one
belief
they
all
held
in
common
for
it
was
generally
accepted
as
an
article
of
faith
that
the
indians
encamped
among
the
shrubberies
on
the
back
lawn
secretly
buried
their
dead
behind
the
crumbling
walls
of
its
weedy
garden
the
dead
provided
by
the
children
battles
be
it
understood
wakeful
ears
in
the
had
heard
strange
sounds
coming
from
that
direction
when
the
windows
were
open
on
hot
summer
nights
and
the
gardener
supreme
authority
on
all
that
happened
in
the
night
since
they
believed
that
he
sat
up
to
watch
the
vegetables
and
ripen
and
never
went
to
bed
at
all
was
evidently
of
the
same
persuasion
when
appealed
to
for
an
explanation
of
the
mournful
he
knew
what
was
expected
of
him
and
rose
manfully
to
the
occasion
it
either
them
redskins
aburyin
wot
you
killed
of
yesterday
he
declared
pointing
towards
the
empty
house
with
a
bit
of
broken
or
else
it
the
ones
you
killed
last
week
and
who
was
always
astealin
of
my
strorbriz
he
looked
very
wise
as
he
said
this
and
his
wand
of
office
a
dirty
trowel
which
he
held
in
his
hand
gave
him
tremendous
dignity
that
just
what
thought
and
of
course
if
you
say
so
too
that
settles
it
said
nixie
it
likely
missie
leastways
from
wot
you
describes
which
it
is
a
hempty
house
all
the
same
though
i
ca
say
as
i
heard
no
sounds
not
very
distinct
that
is
myself
the
gardener
may
have
been
anxious
to
hedge
a
bit
for
fear
of
a
scolding
from
headquarters
but
his
cryptic
remarks
pleased
the
children
greatly
because
it
showed
they
thought
that
they
knew
more
than
the
gardener
did
thus
the
empty
house
remained
an
object
of
somewhat
dreadful
delight
lending
a
touch
of
wonderland
to
that
part
of
the
lane
where
it
stood
and
forming
the
background
for
many
an
enchanting
story
over
the
nursery
fire
in
it
appealed
vividly
to
their
imaginations
especially
to
jimbo
its
dark
windows
without
blinds
were
sometimes
full
of
faces
that
retreated
the
moment
they
were
looked
at
that
tangled
ivy
did
not
grow
over
the
roof
so
thickly
for
nothing
and
those
high
elms
on
the
western
side
had
not
been
planted
years
ago
in
a
semicircle
without
a
reason
thus
at
least
the
children
argued
not
knowing
exactly
what
they
meant
nor
caring
much
so
long
as
they
proved
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
the
place
was
properly
haunted
and
therefore
worthy
of
their
attention
it
was
natural
they
should
lead
miss
lake
in
that
direction
on
one
of
their
first
walks
together
and
it
was
natural
too
that
she
should
at
once
discover
from
their
manner
that
the
place
was
of
some
importance
to
them
what
a
old
house
she
remarked
when
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
lane
and
it
came
into
view
almost
a
ruin
is
it
the
children
exchanged
glances
a
ruin
did
not
seem
the
right
sort
of
word
at
all
and
besides
was
a
little
disrespectful
also
they
were
not
sure
whether
the
new
governess
ought
to
be
told
everything
so
soon
she
had
not
really
won
their
confidence
yet
after
a
slight
pause
and
a
children
pause
is
the
most
eloquent
imaginable
nixie
being
the
eldest
said
in
a
stiff
little
voice
it
the
empty
house
miss
lake
know
it
very
well
indeed
it
looks
empty
observed
miss
lake
briskly
but
it
not
a
ruin
of
course
added
the
child
with
the
cold
dignity
of
chosen
spokesman
oh
said
the
governess
quite
missing
the
point
she
was
talking
lightly
on
the
surface
of
things
wholly
ignorant
of
the
depths
beneath
her
feet
intuition
with
her
having
always
been
sternly
repressed
it
a
gamekeeper
cottage
or
something
like
that
i
suppose
she
said
oh
no
it
is
a
bit
does
it
belong
to
your
father
then
no
it
somebody
else
you
see
then
you
ca
have
it
pulled
down
rather
not
of
course
not
exclaimed
several
indignant
voices
at
once
miss
lake
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
it
held
more
than
ordinary
importance
in
their
mind
tell
me
about
it
she
said
what
is
its
history
and
who
used
to
live
in
it
there
came
another
pause
the
children
looked
into
each
others
faces
they
gazed
at
the
blue
sky
overhead
then
they
stared
at
the
dusty
road
at
their
feet
but
no
one
volunteered
an
answer
miss
lake
they
felt
was
approaching
the
subject
in
an
offensive
manner
why
are
you
all
so
mysterious
about
it
she
went
on
it
only
a
old
place
and
must
be
very
draughty
to
live
in
even
for
a
gamekeeper
silence
come
children
do
you
hear
me
i
asking
you
a
question
a
couple
of
startled
birds
flew
out
of
the
ivy
with
a
great
whirring
of
wings
this
was
followed
by
a
faint
sound
of
rumbling
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
interior
of
the
house
outside
all
was
still
and
the
hot
sunshine
lay
over
everything
the
sound
was
repeated
the
children
looked
at
each
other
with
large
expectant
eyes
something
in
the
house
was
moving
was
coming
nearer
have
you
lost
your
tongues
asked
the
governess
impatiently
but
you
see
nixie
said
at
length
somebody
live
in
it
now
and
who
is
he
i
did
say
it
was
a
whoever
it
is
tell
me
about
the
person
persisted
miss
lake
there
really
nothing
to
tell
replied
the
child
without
looking
up
oh
but
there
must
be
something
declared
the
logical
young
governess
or
you
would
object
so
much
to
its
being
pulled
down
nixie
looked
puzzled
but
jimbo
came
to
the
rescue
at
once
but
would
understand
if
we
did
tell
you
he
said
in
a
slow
respectful
voice
his
tone
held
a
touch
of
that
indescribable
scorn
heard
sometimes
in
a
child
tone
the
utter
contempt
for
the
stupid
creature
miss
lake
noticed
and
felt
annoyed
she
recognised
that
she
was
not
getting
on
well
with
the
children
and
it
piqued
her
she
remembered
the
colonel
words
about
knocking
the
nonsense
out
of
james
head
and
she
saw
that
her
first
opportunity
in
fact
her
first
real
test
was
at
hand
and
why
pray
should
i
not
understand
she
asked
with
some
sharpness
is
the
mystery
so
great
for
some
reason
the
duty
of
spokesman
now
devolved
unmistakably
upon
jimbo
and
very
seriously
too
he
accepted
the
task
standing
with
his
feet
firmly
planted
in
the
road
and
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
you
see
miss
lake
he
began
gravely
we
know
such
a
lot
of
things
in
there
that
they
might
not
like
us
to
tell
you
about
them
they
know
you
yet
if
they
did
it
might
be
different
but
but
you
see
it
is
this
was
rather
crushing
to
the
aspiring
educator
and
the
instructions
gained
additional
point
in
the
light
of
the
explanation
fiddlesticks
she
laughed
there
probably
nothing
at
all
in
there
except
rats
and
cobwebs
indeed
i
knew
you
would
understand
said
jimbo
coolly
with
no
sign
of
being
offended
how
could
you
he
glanced
at
his
sisters
gaining
so
much
support
from
their
enigmatical
faces
that
he
added
for
their
especial
benefit
how
could
she
the
said
so
too
chimed
in
a
younger
sister
with
a
vague
notion
that
their
precious
empty
house
was
being
robbed
of
its
glory
yes
but
james
dear
i
do
understand
perfectly
continued
miss
lake
more
gently
and
wisely
ignoring
the
reference
to
the
authority
of
the
only
you
see
i
can
not
really
encourage
you
in
such
nonsense
it
is
nonsense
interrupted
jimbo
with
heat
but
believe
me
children
it
nonsense
how
do
you
know
that
there
anything
inside
you
never
been
there
you
can
know
perfectly
well
what
inside
a
thing
without
having
gone
there
replied
jimbo
with
scorn
at
least
can
miss
lake
changed
her
tack
a
little
fatally
as
it
appeared
afterwards
i
know
at
any
rate
she
said
with
decision
that
there
nothing
good
in
there
whatever
there
may
be
is
bad
thoroughly
bad
and
not
fit
for
you
to
play
with
the
other
children
moved
away
but
jimbo
stood
his
ground
they
were
all
angry
disappointed
sore
hurt
and
offended
but
jimbo
suddenly
began
to
feel
something
else
besides
anger
and
vexation
it
was
a
new
point
of
view
to
him
that
the
empty
house
might
contain
bad
things
as
well
as
good
or
perhaps
only
bad
things
his
imagination
seized
upon
the
point
at
once
and
set
to
work
vigorously
to
develop
it
this
was
his
way
with
all
such
things
and
he
could
not
prevent
it
bad
things
he
repeated
looking
up
at
the
governess
you
mean
things
that
could
hurt
yes
of
course
she
said
noting
the
effect
of
her
words
and
thinking
how
pleased
the
colonel
would
be
later
when
he
heard
it
things
that
might
run
out
and
catch
you
some
day
when
you
passing
here
alone
and
take
you
back
a
prisoner
then
you
be
a
prisoner
in
the
empty
house
all
your
life
think
of
that
miss
lake
mistook
the
boy
silence
as
proof
that
she
was
taking
the
right
line
she
enlarged
upon
this
view
of
the
matter
now
she
was
so
successfully
launched
and
described
the
of
the
with
such
wealth
of
detail
that
she
felt
sure
her
listener
would
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
place
again
and
that
she
had
knocked
out
this
particular
bit
of
nonsense
for
ever
and
a
day
but
to
jimbo
it
was
a
new
and
horrible
idea
that
the
empty
house
haunted
hitherto
only
by
rather
jolly
and
wonderful
red
indians
contained
a
monster
who
might
take
him
prisoner
and
the
thought
made
him
feel
afraid
the
mischief
had
of
course
been
done
and
the
terror
in
his
eyes
was
unmistakable
when
the
foolish
governess
saw
her
mistake
retreat
was
impossible
the
boy
was
shaking
with
fear
and
not
all
miss
lake
genuine
sympathy
or
nixie
explanations
and
soothings
were
able
to
relieve
his
mind
of
its
new
burden
hitherto
jimbo
imagination
had
loved
to
dwell
upon
the
pleasant
side
of
things
invisible
but
now
he
had
been
severely
frightened
and
his
imagination
took
a
new
turn
not
only
the
empty
house
but
all
his
inner
world
to
which
it
was
in
some
sense
the
key
underwent
a
distressing
change
his
sense
of
horror
had
been
vividly
aroused
the
governess
would
willingly
have
corrected
her
mistake
but
was
of
course
powerless
to
do
so
bitterly
she
regretted
her
tactlessness
and
folly
but
she
could
do
nothing
and
to
add
to
her
distress
she
saw
that
jimbo
shrank
from
her
in
a
way
that
could
not
long
escape
the
watchful
eye
of
the
mother
but
if
the
boy
shed
tears
of
fear
that
night
in
his
bed
it
must
in
justice
be
told
that
she
for
her
part
cried
bitterly
in
her
own
room
not
that
she
had
endangered
her
place
but
that
she
had
done
a
cruel
injury
to
a
child
and
that
she
was
helpless
to
undo
it
for
she
loved
children
though
she
was
quite
unsuited
to
take
care
of
them
her
just
reward
however
came
swiftly
upon
her
a
few
nights
later
when
jimbo
and
nixie
were
allowed
to
come
down
to
dessert
the
wind
was
heard
to
make
a
queer
moaning
sound
in
the
ivy
branches
that
hung
over
the
windows
jimbo
heard
it
too
he
held
his
breath
for
a
minute
then
he
looked
round
the
table
in
a
frightened
way
and
the
next
minute
gave
a
scream
and
burst
into
tears
he
ran
round
and
buried
his
face
in
his
father
arms
after
the
tears
came
the
truth
it
was
a
bad
thing
for
miss
ethel
lake
this
little
sighing
of
the
wind
and
the
ivy
leaves
for
the
djin
of
terror
she
had
thoughtlessly
evoked
swept
into
the
room
and
introduced
himself
to
the
parents
without
her
leave
what
new
nonsense
is
this
now
growled
the
soldier
leaving
his
walnuts
and
lifting
the
boy
on
to
his
knee
he
should
come
down
till
he
a
little
older
and
knows
how
to
behave
what
the
matter
darling
child
asked
the
mother
drying
his
eyes
tenderly
i
heard
the
bad
things
crying
in
the
empty
house
the
empty
house
is
a
mile
away
from
here
snorted
the
colonel
then
it
come
nearer
declared
the
frightened
boy
who
told
you
there
were
bad
things
in
the
empty
house
asked
the
mother
yes
who
told
you
indeed
i
should
like
to
know
demanded
the
colonel
and
then
it
all
came
out
the
colonel
wife
was
very
quiet
but
very
determined
miss
lake
went
back
to
the
clerical
family
whence
she
had
come
and
the
children
knew
her
no
more
i
glad
said
nixie
expressing
the
verdict
of
the
nursery
i
thought
she
was
awfully
stupid
she
was
a
real
lake
at
all
declared
another
she
was
only
a
sort
of
puddle
jimbo
however
said
little
and
the
colonel
likewise
held
his
peace
but
the
governess
whether
she
was
a
lake
or
only
a
puddle
left
her
mark
behind
her
the
empty
house
was
no
longer
harmless
it
had
a
new
lease
of
life
it
was
tenanted
by
some
one
who
could
never
have
friendly
relations
with
children
the
weeds
in
the
old
garden
took
on
fantastic
shapes
figures
hid
behind
the
doors
and
crept
about
the
passages
the
rooks
in
the
high
elms
became
birds
of
the
ivy
bristled
upon
the
walls
and
the
trivial
explanations
of
the
gardener
were
no
longer
satisfactory
even
in
bright
sunshine
a
shadow
lay
crouching
upon
the
broken
roof
at
any
moment
it
might
leap
into
life
and
with
immense
striding
legs
chase
the
children
down
to
the
very
park
gates
there
was
no
need
to
enforce
the
decree
that
the
empty
house
was
a
forbidden
land
the
children
of
their
own
accord
declared
it
out
of
bounds
and
avoided
it
as
carefully
as
if
all
the
wild
animals
from
the
zoo
were
roaming
its
gardens
hungry
and
unchained
chapter
iii
the
shock
one
immediate
result
of
miss
lake
indiscretion
was
that
the
children
preferred
to
play
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
the
side
farthest
from
the
empty
house
a
spiked
railing
here
divided
them
from
a
field
in
which
cows
disported
themselves
and
as
bulls
also
sometimes
were
admitted
to
the
cows
the
field
was
strictly
out
of
bounds
in
this
spiked
railing
not
far
from
the
great
shrubberies
where
the
indians
increased
and
multiplied
there
was
a
swinging
gate
the
children
swung
on
it
whenever
they
could
they
called
it
express
trains
and
the
fact
that
it
was
forbidden
only
added
to
their
pleasure
when
opened
at
its
widest
it
would
swing
them
with
a
rush
through
the
air
past
the
pillars
with
a
click
out
into
the
field
and
then
back
again
into
the
garden
it
was
bad
for
the
hinges
and
it
was
also
bad
for
the
garden
because
it
was
frequently
left
open
after
these
carnivals
and
the
cows
got
in
and
trod
the
flowers
down
the
children
were
not
afraid
of
the
cows
but
they
held
the
bull
in
great
horror
and
these
trivial
things
have
been
mentioned
here
because
of
the
part
they
played
in
jimbo
subsequent
adventures
it
was
only
ten
days
or
so
after
miss
lake
sudden
departure
when
jimbo
managed
one
evening
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
his
lawful
guardians
and
wandered
off
unnoticed
among
the
laburnums
on
the
front
lawn
from
the
laburnums
he
passed
successfully
to
the
first
laurel
shrubbery
and
thence
he
executed
a
clever
flank
movement
and
entered
the
carriage
drive
in
the
rear
the
rest
was
easy
and
he
soon
found
himself
at
the
lodge
gate
for
some
moments
he
peered
through
the
iron
grating
and
pondered
on
the
seductiveness
of
the
dusty
road
and
of
the
ditch
beyond
to
his
surprise
he
found
presently
that
the
gate
was
moving
outwards
it
was
yielding
to
his
weight
one
thing
leads
easily
to
another
sometimes
and
the
open
gate
led
easily
on
to
the
seductive
road
the
result
was
that
a
minute
later
jimbo
was
chasing
butterflies
along
the
green
lane
and
throwing
stones
into
the
water
of
the
ditch
it
was
the
evening
of
a
hot
summer
day
and
the
butterflies
were
still
out
in
force
jimbo
delight
was
intense
the
joy
of
finding
himself
alone
where
he
had
no
right
to
be
put
everything
else
out
of
his
head
and
for
some
time
he
wandered
on
oblivious
of
all
but
the
intoxicating
sense
of
freedom
and
the
difficulty
of
choosing
between
so
many
butterflies
and
such
a
magnificently
dirty
ditch
at
first
he
yielded
to
the
seductions
of
the
ditch
he
caught
a
big
sleepy
beetle
and
put
it
on
a
violet
leaf
and
sent
it
sailing
out
to
sea
and
when
it
landed
on
the
farther
shore
he
found
a
still
bigger
leaf
and
sent
it
forth
on
a
voyage
in
another
direction
with
a
cargo
of
daisy
petals
and
a
hairy
caterpillar
for
a
mate
but
just
as
the
vessel
was
getting
under
way
a
butterfly
of
amazing
brilliance
floated
past
insolently
under
his
very
nose
leaving
the
beetle
and
the
caterpillar
to
navigate
the
currents
as
best
they
could
he
at
once
gave
chase
cap
in
hand
he
flew
after
the
butterfly
down
the
lane
and
a
dozen
times
when
his
cap
was
just
upon
it
it
sailed
away
sideways
without
the
least
effort
and
escaped
him
then
suddenly
the
lane
took
a
familiar
turning
the
ditch
stopped
abruptly
the
hedge
on
his
right
fell
away
altogether
the
butterfly
danced
out
of
sight
into
a
field
and
jimbo
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
one
thing
in
the
whole
world
that
could
at
that
time
fill
him
with
abject
terror
the
empty
house
he
came
to
a
full
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
stared
up
at
the
windows
he
realised
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
alone
and
that
it
was
possible
for
brilliant
sunshine
even
on
a
cloudless
day
to
become
somehow
lustreless
and
dull
the
walls
showed
a
deep
red
in
the
sunset
light
the
house
was
still
as
the
grave
his
feet
were
rooted
to
the
ground
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
move
a
single
muscle
and
as
he
stood
there
the
blood
ebbing
quickly
from
his
heart
the
words
of
the
governess
a
few
days
before
rushed
back
into
his
mind
and
turned
his
fear
into
a
dreadful
horror
in
another
minute
the
battered
door
would
slowly
open
and
the
horrible
inmate
come
out
to
seize
him
already
there
was
a
sound
of
something
moving
within
and
as
he
gazed
fascinated
with
terror
a
shuddering
movement
ran
over
the
ivy
leaves
hanging
down
from
the
roof
then
they
parted
in
the
middle
and
something
he
could
not
in
his
agony
see
what
flew
out
with
a
whirring
sound
into
his
face
and
then
vanished
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
fields
jimbo
did
not
pause
a
single
second
to
find
out
what
it
was
or
to
reflect
that
any
ordinary
thrush
would
have
made
just
the
same
sound
the
shock
it
gave
to
his
heart
immediately
loosened
the
muscles
of
his
little
legs
and
he
ran
for
his
very
life
but
before
he
actually
began
to
run
he
gave
one
piercing
scream
for
help
and
the
person
he
screamed
to
was
the
very
person
who
was
unwittingly
the
cause
of
his
distress
it
was
as
though
he
knew
instinctively
that
the
person
who
had
created
for
him
the
terror
of
the
empty
house
with
its
horrible
inmate
was
also
the
person
who
could
properly
banish
it
and
undo
the
mischief
before
it
was
too
late
he
shrieked
for
help
to
the
governess
miss
ethel
lake
of
course
there
was
no
answer
but
the
noise
of
the
air
whistling
in
his
ears
as
his
feet
flew
over
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
dust
there
was
no
friendly
butcher
cart
no
baker
boy
or
farmer
with
his
dog
and
gun
the
road
was
deserted
there
was
not
even
the
beetle
or
the
caterpillar
he
was
beyond
reach
of
help
jimbo
ran
for
his
life
but
unfortunately
he
ran
in
the
wrong
direction
instead
of
going
the
way
he
had
come
where
the
lodge
gates
were
ready
to
receive
him
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
he
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
it
so
happened
that
the
lane
flanked
the
field
where
the
cows
lived
but
cows
were
nothing
compared
to
a
creature
from
the
empty
house
and
even
bulls
seemed
friendly
the
boy
was
over
the
gate
in
a
twinkling
and
across
the
field
before
he
heard
a
heavy
thunderous
sound
behind
him
either
the
thing
had
followed
him
into
the
field
or
it
was
the
bull
as
he
raced
he
managed
to
throw
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
a
huge
dark
mass
bearing
down
upon
him
at
terrific
speed
it
must
be
the
bull
he
reflected
the
bull
grown
to
the
size
of
an
elephant
and
it
appeared
to
him
to
have
two
immense
black
wings
that
flapped
at
its
sides
and
helped
it
forward
making
a
whirring
noise
like
the
arms
of
a
great
windmill
this
sight
added
to
his
speed
but
he
could
not
last
very
much
longer
already
his
body
ached
all
over
and
the
frantic
effort
to
get
breath
nearly
choked
him
there
before
him
not
so
very
far
away
now
was
the
swinging
gate
if
only
he
could
get
there
in
time
to
scramble
over
into
the
garden
he
would
be
safe
it
seemed
almost
impossible
and
behind
him
meanwhile
the
sound
of
the
following
creature
came
closer
and
closer
the
ground
seemed
to
tremble
he
could
almost
feel
the
breath
on
his
neck
the
swinging
gate
was
only
twenty
yards
off
now
ten
now
only
five
now
he
had
reached
it
at
last
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
seize
the
top
bar
and
in
another
moment
he
would
have
been
safe
in
the
garden
and
within
easy
reach
of
the
house
but
before
he
actually
touched
the
iron
rail
a
sharp
stinging
pain
shot
across
his
back
he
drew
one
final
breath
as
he
felt
himself
being
lifted
lifted
up
into
the
air
the
horns
had
caught
him
just
behind
the
shoulders
there
seemed
to
be
no
pain
after
the
first
shock
he
rose
high
into
the
air
while
the
bushes
and
spiked
railing
he
knew
so
well
sank
out
of
sight
beneath
him
dwindling
curiously
in
size
at
first
he
thought
his
head
must
bump
against
the
sky
but
suddenly
he
stopped
rising
and
the
green
earth
rushed
up
as
if
it
would
strike
him
in
the
face
this
meant
he
was
sinking
again
the
gate
and
railing
flew
by
underneath
him
and
the
next
second
he
fell
with
a
crash
upon
the
soft
grass
of
the
lawn
upon
the
other
side
he
had
been
tossed
over
the
gate
into
the
garden
and
the
bull
could
no
longer
reach
him
before
he
became
wholly
unconscious
a
composite
picture
vivid
in
its
detail
engraved
itself
deeply
with
exceeding
swiftness
line
by
line
upon
the
waxen
tablets
of
his
mind
in
this
picture
the
thrush
that
had
flown
out
of
the
ivy
the
empty
house
itself
and
its
horrible
pursuing
inmate
were
all
somehow
curiously
mingled
together
with
the
black
wings
of
the
bull
and
with
his
own
sensation
of
rushing
flying
headlong
through
space
as
he
rose
and
fell
in
a
curve
from
the
creature
horns
and
behind
it
he
was
conscious
that
the
real
author
of
it
all
was
somewhere
in
the
shadowy
background
looking
on
as
though
to
watch
the
result
of
her
unfortunate
mistake
miss
lake
surely
was
not
very
far
away
he
associated
her
with
the
horror
of
the
empty
house
as
inevitably
as
taste
and
smell
join
together
in
the
memory
of
a
certain
food
and
the
very
last
thought
in
his
mind
as
he
sank
away
into
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
was
a
sort
of
bitter
surprise
that
the
governess
had
not
turned
up
to
save
him
before
it
was
actually
too
late
moreover
a
certain
sense
of
disappointment
mingled
with
the
terror
of
the
shock
for
he
was
dimly
aware
that
miss
lake
had
not
acted
as
worthily
as
she
might
have
done
and
had
not
played
the
game
as
well
as
might
have
been
expected
of
her
and
somehow
it
did
all
seem
quite
fair
chapter
iv
on
the
edge
of
unconsciousness
jimbo
had
fallen
on
his
head
inside
that
head
lay
the
mass
of
highly
sensitive
matter
called
the
brain
on
which
were
recorded
of
course
the
impressions
of
everything
that
had
yet
come
to
him
in
life
a
severe
shock
such
as
he
had
just
sustained
was
bound
to
throw
these
impressions
into
confusion
and
disorder
jumbling
them
up
into
new
and
strange
combinations
obliterating
some
and
exaggerating
others
jimbo
himself
was
helpless
in
the
matter
he
could
exercise
no
control
over
their
antics
until
the
doctors
had
once
again
reduced
them
to
order
he
would
have
to
wander
lost
and
lonely
through
the
comparative
chaos
of
disproportioned
visions
generally
known
as
the
region
of
delirium
until
the
doctor
assisted
by
mother
nature
restored
him
once
more
to
normal
consciousness
for
a
time
everything
was
a
blank
but
presently
he
stirred
uneasily
in
the
grass
and
the
pictures
graven
on
the
tablets
of
his
mind
began
to
come
back
to
him
line
by
line
yet
with
certain
changes
the
bull
for
instance
had
so
far
vanished
into
the
background
of
his
thoughts
that
it
had
practically
disappeared
altogether
and
he
recalled
nothing
of
it
but
the
wings
the
huge
flapping
wings
of
the
creature
to
whom
the
wings
belonged
he
had
no
recollection
beyond
that
it
was
very
large
and
that
it
was
chasing
him
from
the
empty
house
the
pain
in
his
shoulders
had
also
gone
but
what
remained
with
undiminished
vividness
were
the
sensations
of
flight
without
escape
the
breathless
race
up
into
the
sky
and
the
swift
tumbling
drop
again
through
the
air
on
to
the
lawn
this
impression
of
rushing
through
space
short
though
the
actual
distance
had
been
was
the
dominating
memory
all
else
was
apparently
oblivion
he
forgot
where
he
came
from
and
he
forgot
what
he
had
been
doing
the
events
leading
up
to
the
catastrophe
indeed
everything
connected
with
his
existence
previously
as
master
james
had
entirely
vanished
and
the
slate
of
memory
had
been
wiped
so
clean
that
he
had
forgotten
even
his
own
name
jimbo
was
lying
so
to
speak
on
the
edge
of
unconsciousness
and
for
a
time
it
seemed
uncertain
whether
he
would
cross
the
line
into
the
region
of
delirium
and
dreams
or
fall
back
again
into
his
natural
world
terror
assisted
by
the
horns
of
the
black
bull
had
tossed
him
into
the
borderland
his
last
scream
however
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
ubiquitous
gardener
and
help
was
near
at
hand
he
heard
voices
that
seemed
to
come
from
beyond
the
stars
and
was
aware
that
shadowy
forms
were
standing
over
him
and
talking
in
whispers
but
it
was
all
very
unreal
one
minute
the
voices
sounded
up
in
the
sky
and
the
next
in
his
very
ears
while
the
figures
moved
about
sometimes
bending
over
him
sometimes
retreating
and
melting
away
like
shadows
on
a
shifting
screen
suddenly
a
blaze
of
light
flashed
upon
him
and
his
eyes
flew
open
he
tumbled
back
for
a
moment
into
his
normal
world
he
was
on
the
grass
at
all
but
was
lying
upon
his
own
bed
in
the
night
nursery
his
mother
was
bending
over
him
with
a
very
white
face
and
a
tall
man
dressed
in
black
stood
beside
her
holding
some
kind
of
shining
instrument
in
his
fingers
a
little
behind
them
he
saw
nixie
shading
a
lamp
with
her
hand
then
the
white
face
came
close
over
the
pillow
and
a
voice
full
of
tenderness
whispered
my
darling
boy
do
you
know
me
mother
no
one
will
hurt
you
speak
to
me
if
you
can
dear
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
jimbo
knew
her
and
made
an
effort
to
answer
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
whole
body
had
suddenly
become
a
solid
mass
of
iron
and
he
could
control
no
part
of
it
his
lips
and
his
hands
both
refused
to
move
before
he
could
make
a
sign
that
he
had
understood
and
was
trying
to
reply
a
fierce
flame
rushed
between
them
and
blinded
him
his
eyes
closed
and
he
dropped
back
again
into
utter
darkness
the
walls
flew
asunder
and
the
ceiling
melted
into
air
while
the
bed
sank
away
beneath
him
down
down
down
into
an
abyss
of
shadows
the
lamp
in
nixie
hands
dwindled
into
a
star
and
his
mother
anxious
face
became
a
tiny
patch
of
white
in
the
distance
blurred
out
of
all
semblance
of
a
human
countenance
for
a
time
the
man
in
black
seemed
to
hover
over
the
bed
as
it
sank
as
though
he
were
trying
to
follow
it
down
but
it
too
presently
joined
the
general
enveloping
blackness
and
lost
its
outline
the
pain
had
blotted
out
everything
and
the
return
to
consciousness
had
been
only
momentary
not
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
could
have
made
things
otherwise
jimbo
was
off
on
his
travels
at
last
travels
in
which
the
chief
incidents
were
directly
traceable
to
the
causes
and
details
of
his
accident
the
terror
of
the
empty
house
the
pursuit
of
its
inmate
the
pain
of
the
bull
horns
and
above
all
the
flight
through
the
air
for
everything
in
his
subsequent
adventures
found
its
inspiration
in
the
events
described
and
a
singular
parallel
ran
ever
between
the
jimbo
upon
the
bed
in
the
and
the
other
emancipated
jimbo
wandering
in
the
regions
of
unconsciousness
and
delirium
chapter
v
into
the
empty
house
the
darkness
lasted
a
long
time
without
a
break
and
when
it
lifted
all
recollection
of
the
bedroom
scene
had
vanished
jimbo
found
himself
back
again
on
the
grass
the
swinging
gate
was
just
in
front
of
him
but
he
did
not
recognise
it
no
suggestion
of
express
trains
came
back
to
him
as
his
eyes
rested
without
remembrance
upon
the
bars
where
he
had
so
often
swung
in
defiance
of
orders
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
recollection
of
his
home
family
and
previous
life
he
had
absolutely
none
or
at
least
it
was
buried
so
deeply
in
his
inner
consciousness
that
it
amounted
to
the
same
thing
and
he
looked
out
upon
the
garden
the
gate
and
the
field
beyond
as
upon
an
entirely
new
piece
of
the
world
the
stars
he
saw
were
nearly
all
gone
and
a
very
faint
light
was
beginning
to
spread
from
the
woods
beyond
the
field
the
eastern
horizon
was
slowly
brightening
and
soon
the
night
would
be
gone
jimbo
was
glad
of
this
he
began
to
be
conscious
of
little
thrills
of
expectation
for
with
the
light
surely
help
would
also
come
the
light
always
brought
relief
and
he
already
felt
that
strange
excitement
that
comes
with
the
first
signs
of
dawn
in
the
distance
cocks
were
crowing
horses
began
to
stamp
in
the
barns
not
far
away
and
a
hundred
little
stirrings
of
life
ran
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
the
light
crept
slowly
up
the
sky
and
dropped
down
again
upon
the
world
with
its
message
of
coming
day
of
course
help
would
come
by
the
time
the
sun
was
really
up
and
it
was
partly
this
certainty
and
partly
because
he
was
a
little
too
dazed
to
realise
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
that
prevented
his
giving
way
to
a
fit
of
fear
and
weeping
yet
a
feeling
of
vague
terror
lay
only
a
little
way
below
the
surface
and
when
a
few
moments
later
he
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
and
that
an
figure
was
creeping
towards
him
from
the
shrubberies
he
sprang
to
his
feet
prepared
to
run
unless
it
at
once
showed
the
most
friendly
intentions
this
figure
seemed
to
have
come
from
nowhere
apparently
it
had
risen
out
of
the
earth
it
was
too
large
to
have
been
concealed
by
the
low
shrubberies
yet
he
had
not
been
aware
of
its
approach
and
it
had
appeared
without
making
any
noise
probably
it
was
friendly
he
felt
in
spite
of
its
curious
shape
and
the
stealthy
way
it
had
come
at
least
he
hoped
so
and
if
he
could
only
have
told
whether
it
was
a
man
or
an
animal
he
would
easily
have
made
up
his
mind
but
the
uncertain
light
and
the
way
it
crouched
behind
the
bushes
prevented
this
so
he
stood
poised
ready
to
run
and
yet
waiting
hoping
indeed
expecting
every
minute
a
sign
of
friendliness
and
help
in
this
way
the
two
faced
each
other
silently
for
some
time
until
the
feeling
of
terror
gradually
stole
deeper
into
the
boy
heart
and
began
to
rob
him
of
full
power
over
his
muscles
he
wondered
if
he
would
be
able
to
run
when
the
time
came
and
whether
he
could
run
fast
enough
this
was
how
it
first
showed
itself
this
suggestion
of
insidious
fear
would
he
be
able
to
keep
up
the
start
he
had
would
it
chase
him
would
it
run
like
a
man
or
like
an
animal
on
four
legs
or
on
two
he
wished
he
could
see
more
clearly
what
it
was
he
still
stood
his
ground
pluckily
facing
it
and
waiting
but
the
fear
once
admitted
to
his
mind
was
gaining
strength
and
he
began
to
feel
cold
and
shivery
then
suddenly
the
tension
came
to
an
end
in
two
strides
the
figure
came
up
close
to
his
side
and
the
same
second
jimbo
was
lifted
off
his
feet
and
borne
swiftly
away
across
the
field
he
felt
quite
unable
to
offer
the
least
resistance
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
sense
of
relief
that
something
had
happened
at
last
he
was
still
not
sure
that
the
figure
was
unkind
only
its
shape
filled
him
with
a
feeling
that
was
certainly
the
beginning
of
real
horror
it
was
the
shape
of
a
man
he
thought
but
of
a
very
large
and
man
for
it
certainly
had
moved
on
two
legs
and
had
caught
him
up
in
a
pair
of
tremendously
strong
arms
but
there
was
something
else
it
had
besides
arms
for
a
kind
of
soft
cloak
hung
all
round
it
and
wrapped
the
boy
from
head
to
foot
preventing
him
seeing
his
captor
properly
and
at
the
same
time
filling
his
body
with
a
kind
of
warm
drowsiness
that
mitigated
his
active
fear
and
made
him
rather
like
the
sensation
of
being
carried
along
so
easily
and
so
fast
but
was
he
being
carried
the
pace
they
were
going
was
amazing
and
he
moved
as
easily
as
a
sailing
boat
and
with
the
same
swinging
motion
could
it
be
some
animal
like
a
horse
after
all
jimbo
tried
to
see
more
but
found
it
impossible
to
free
himself
from
the
folds
of
the
enveloping
substance
and
meanwhile
they
were
swinging
forward
at
what
seemed
a
tremendous
pace
over
fields
and
ditches
through
hedges
and
down
long
lanes
the
odours
of
earth
and
grass
and
opening
flowers
came
to
him
he
heard
the
birds
singing
and
felt
the
cool
morning
air
sting
his
cheeks
as
they
raced
along
there
was
no
jolting
or
jarring
and
the
figure
seemed
to
cover
the
ground
as
lightly
as
though
it
hardly
touched
the
earth
it
was
certainly
not
a
dream
he
was
sure
of
that
but
the
longer
they
went
on
the
drowsier
he
became
and
the
less
he
wondered
whether
the
figure
was
going
to
help
him
or
to
do
something
dreadful
to
him
he
was
now
thoroughly
afraid
and
yet
strange
contradiction
he
did
care
a
bit
let
the
figure
do
what
it
liked
it
was
only
a
sort
of
nightmare
person
after
all
and
might
vanish
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arrived
for
a
long
time
they
raced
forward
at
this
great
speed
and
then
with
a
bump
and
a
crash
they
stopped
suddenly
short
and
jimbo
felt
himself
let
down
upon
the
solid
earth
he
tried
to
free
himself
at
once
from
the
folds
of
the
clinging
substance
that
enveloped
him
but
before
he
could
do
so
and
see
what
his
captor
was
really
like
he
heard
a
door
slam
and
felt
himself
pushed
along
what
seemed
to
be
the
hallways
of
a
house
his
eyes
were
clear
now
and
he
could
see
but
the
darkness
had
come
down
again
so
thickly
that
all
he
could
discover
was
that
the
figure
was
urging
him
along
the
floor
of
a
large
empty
hall
and
that
they
were
in
a
dark
and
empty
building
jimbo
tried
hard
to
see
his
captor
but
the
figure
dim
enough
in
the
uncertain
light
always
managed
to
hide
its
face
and
keep
itself
bunched
up
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
never
see
more
than
a
great
dark
mass
of
a
body
from
which
long
legs
and
arms
shot
out
like
telescopes
draped
in
a
sort
of
clinging
cloak
now
that
the
rapid
motion
through
the
air
had
ceased
the
boy
drowsiness
passed
a
little
and
he
began
to
shiver
with
fear
and
to
feel
that
the
tears
could
not
be
kept
back
much
longer
probably
in
another
minute
he
would
have
started
to
run
for
his
life
when
a
new
sound
caught
his
ears
and
made
him
listen
intently
while
a
feeling
of
wonder
and
delight
caught
his
heart
and
made
him
momentarily
forget
the
figure
pushing
him
forward
from
behind
was
it
the
wind
he
heard
or
was
it
the
voices
of
children
all
singing
together
very
low
it
was
a
gentle
sighing
sound
that
rose
and
fell
with
mournful
modulations
and
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
centre
of
the
building
it
held
too
a
strange
murmur
like
the
surge
of
a
faint
breeze
moving
in
the
it
might
be
the
wind
playing
round
the
walls
of
the
building
or
it
might
be
children
singing
in
hushed
voices
one
minute
he
thought
it
was
outside
the
house
and
the
next
he
was
certain
it
came
from
somewhere
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
he
glanced
up
and
fancied
for
one
moment
that
he
saw
in
the
darkness
a
crowd
of
little
faces
peering
down
at
him
over
the
banisters
and
that
as
they
disappeared
he
heard
the
sound
of
many
little
feet
moving
and
then
a
door
hurriedly
closing
but
a
push
from
the
figure
behind
that
nearly
sent
him
sprawling
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
prevented
his
hearing
very
clearly
and
the
light
was
far
too
dim
to
let
him
feel
sure
of
what
he
had
seen
they
passed
quickly
along
deserted
corridors
and
through
winding
passages
no
one
seemed
about
the
interior
of
the
house
was
chilly
and
the
keen
air
nipped
after
going
up
several
flights
of
stairs
they
stopped
at
last
in
front
of
a
door
and
before
jimbo
had
a
moment
to
turn
and
dash
downstairs
again
past
the
figure
as
he
had
meant
to
do
he
was
pushed
violently
forward
into
a
room
the
door
slammed
after
him
and
he
heard
the
heavy
tread
of
the
figure
as
it
went
down
the
staircase
again
into
the
bottom
of
the
house
then
he
saw
that
the
room
was
full
of
light
and
of
small
moving
beings
curiosity
and
astonishment
now
for
a
moment
took
the
place
of
fear
and
jimbo
with
a
thumping
heart
and
clenched
fists
stood
and
stared
at
the
scene
before
him
he
stiffened
his
little
legs
and
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
but
he
felt
full
of
fight
in
case
anything
happened
and
with
eyes
he
tried
to
take
in
the
whole
scene
at
once
and
be
ready
for
whatever
might
come
but
there
seemed
no
immediate
cause
for
alarm
and
when
he
realised
that
the
beings
in
the
room
were
apparently
children
and
only
children
his
rather
mixed
sensations
of
astonishment
and
fear
gave
place
to
an
emotion
of
overpowering
shyness
he
became
exceedingly
embarrassed
for
he
was
surrounded
by
children
of
all
ages
and
sizes
staring
at
him
just
as
hard
as
he
was
staring
at
them
the
children
he
began
to
take
in
were
all
dressed
in
black
they
looked
frightened
and
unhappy
their
bodies
were
thin
and
their
faces
very
white
there
was
something
else
about
them
he
could
not
quite
name
but
it
inspired
him
with
the
same
sense
of
horror
that
he
had
felt
in
the
arms
of
the
figure
who
had
trapped
him
for
he
now
realised
definitely
that
he
had
been
trapped
and
he
also
began
to
realise
for
the
first
time
that
though
he
still
had
the
body
of
a
little
boy
his
way
of
thinking
and
judging
was
sometimes
more
like
that
of
a
person
the
two
alternated
and
the
result
was
an
odd
confusion
for
sometimes
he
felt
like
a
child
and
thought
like
a
man
while
at
others
he
felt
like
a
man
and
thought
like
a
child
something
had
gone
wrong
very
much
wrong
and
as
he
watched
this
group
of
silent
children
facing
him
he
knew
suddenly
that
what
was
just
beginning
to
happen
to
him
happened
to
them
long
long
for
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
a
long
long
time
in
the
world
yet
their
bodies
had
not
kept
pace
with
their
minds
something
had
happened
to
stop
the
growth
of
the
body
while
allowing
the
mind
to
go
on
developing
the
bodies
were
not
stunted
or
deformed
they
were
nice
little
children
bodies
but
the
minds
within
them
were
and
the
incongruity
was
distressing
all
this
he
suddenly
realised
in
a
flash
intuitively
just
as
though
it
had
been
most
elaborately
explained
to
him
yet
he
could
not
have
put
the
least
part
of
it
into
words
or
have
explained
what
he
saw
and
felt
to
another
he
saw
that
they
had
the
hands
and
figures
of
children
the
heads
of
children
the
unlined
faces
and
smooth
foreheads
of
children
but
their
gestures
and
something
in
their
movements
belonged
to
people
and
the
expression
of
their
eyes
in
meaning
and
intelligence
was
the
expression
of
old
people
and
not
of
children
and
the
expression
in
the
eyes
of
every
one
of
them
he
saw
was
the
expression
of
terror
and
of
pain
the
effect
was
so
singular
that
he
seemed
face
to
face
with
an
entirely
new
order
of
creatures
a
child
features
with
a
man
eyes
a
child
figure
with
a
woman
movements
souls
cramped
and
cribbed
in
absurdly
inadequate
bodies
and
little
puny
frames
the
old
trying
uncouthly
to
express
itself
in
the
young
the
old
portion
of
him
had
been
uppermost
as
he
stared
and
received
these
impressions
but
now
suddenly
it
passed
away
and
he
felt
as
a
little
boy
again
he
glanced
quickly
down
at
his
own
little
body
in
the
alpaca
knickerbockers
and
sailor
blouse
and
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
looked
up
again
at
the
strange
group
facing
him
so
far
at
any
rate
he
had
not
changed
and
there
was
nothing
yet
to
suggest
that
he
was
becoming
like
them
in
appearance
at
least
with
his
back
against
the
door
he
faced
the
roomful
of
children
who
stood
there
motionless
and
staring
and
as
he
looked
wild
feelings
rushed
over
him
and
made
him
tremble
who
was
he
where
had
he
come
from
where
in
the
world
had
he
spent
the
other
years
of
his
life
the
forgotten
years
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
whom
he
could
go
for
comfort
no
one
to
answer
questions
and
there
was
such
a
lot
he
wanted
to
ask
he
seemed
to
be
so
much
older
and
to
know
so
much
more
than
he
ought
to
have
known
and
yet
to
have
forgotten
so
much
that
he
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
his
loss
of
memory
however
was
of
course
only
partial
he
had
forgotten
his
own
identity
and
all
the
people
with
whom
he
had
so
far
in
life
had
to
do
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
had
just
left
all
these
people
and
that
some
day
he
would
find
them
again
it
was
only
the
of
memory
that
had
vanished
and
these
had
not
vanished
for
ever
but
only
sunk
down
a
little
below
the
horizon
then
presently
the
children
began
to
range
themselves
in
rows
between
him
and
the
opposite
wall
without
once
taking
their
horrible
intelligent
eyes
off
him
as
they
moved
he
watched
them
with
growing
dread
but
at
last
his
curiosity
became
so
strong
that
it
overcame
everything
else
and
in
a
voice
that
he
meant
to
be
very
brave
but
that
sounded
hardly
above
a
whisper
he
said
who
are
you
and
what
been
done
to
you
the
answer
came
at
once
in
a
whisper
as
low
as
his
own
though
he
could
not
distinguish
who
spoke
listen
and
you
shall
know
you
too
are
now
one
of
us
immediately
the
children
began
a
slow
impish
sort
of
dance
before
him
moving
almost
with
silent
feet
over
the
boards
yet
with
a
sedateness
and
formality
that
had
none
of
the
unconscious
grace
of
children
and
as
they
danced
they
sang
but
in
voices
so
low
that
it
was
more
like
the
mournful
sighing
of
wind
among
branches
than
human
voices
it
was
the
sound
he
had
already
heard
outside
the
building
we
are
the
children
of
the
whispering
night
who
live
eternally
in
dreadful
fright
of
stories
told
us
in
the
grey
twilight
by
we
are
the
children
of
a
winter
day
under
our
breath
we
chant
this
mournful
lay
we
dance
with
phantoms
and
with
shadows
play
and
have
no
rest
we
have
no
joy
in
any
children
game
for
happiness
to
us
is
but
a
name
since
terror
kissed
us
with
his
lips
of
flame
in
wicked
jest
we
hear
the
little
voices
in
the
wind
singing
of
freedom
we
may
never
find
victims
of
fate
so
cruelly
unkind
we
are
unblest
we
hear
the
little
footsteps
in
the
rain
running
to
help
us
though
they
run
in
vain
tapping
in
hundreds
on
the
in
vain
behest
we
are
the
children
of
the
whispering
night
who
dwell
unrescued
in
eternal
fright
of
stories
told
us
in
the
dim
twilight
by
the
plaintive
song
and
the
dance
ceased
together
and
before
jimbo
could
find
any
words
to
clothe
even
one
of
the
thoughts
that
crowded
through
his
mind
he
saw
them
moving
towards
a
door
he
had
not
hitherto
noticed
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
a
moment
later
they
had
opened
it
and
passed
out
sedate
mournful
unhurried
and
the
boy
found
that
in
some
way
he
could
not
understand
the
light
had
gone
with
them
and
he
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
wall
in
almost
total
darkness
once
out
of
the
room
no
sound
followed
them
and
he
crossed
over
and
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
it
was
locked
then
he
went
back
and
tried
the
other
door
that
too
was
locked
he
was
shut
in
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
figure
intentions
he
was
a
prisoner
trapped
like
an
animal
in
a
cage
the
only
thought
in
his
mind
just
then
was
an
intense
desire
for
freedom
whatever
happened
he
must
escape
he
crossed
the
floor
to
the
only
window
in
the
room
it
was
without
blinds
and
he
looked
out
but
instantly
he
recoiled
with
a
fresh
and
overpowering
sense
of
helplessness
for
it
was
three
storeys
from
the
ground
and
down
below
in
the
shadows
he
saw
a
paved
courtyard
that
rendered
jumping
utterly
out
of
the
question
he
stood
for
a
long
time
fighting
down
the
tears
and
staring
as
if
his
heart
would
break
at
the
field
and
trees
beyond
a
high
wall
enclosed
the
yard
but
beyond
that
was
freedom
and
open
space
feelings
of
loneliness
and
helplessness
terror
and
dismay
overwhelmed
him
his
eyes
burned
and
smarted
yet
strange
to
say
the
tears
now
refused
to
come
and
bring
him
relief
he
could
only
stand
there
with
his
elbows
on
the
and
watch
the
outline
of
the
trees
and
hedges
grow
clearer
and
clearer
as
the
light
drew
across
the
sky
and
the
moment
of
sunrise
came
close
but
when
at
last
he
turned
back
into
the
room
he
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
crouching
against
the
opposite
wall
there
was
a
hooded
figure
steadily
watching
him
chapter
vi
his
companion
in
prison
shocks
of
terror
as
they
increase
in
number
apparently
lessen
in
effect
the
repeated
calls
made
upon
jimbo
soul
by
the
emotions
of
fear
and
astonishment
had
numbed
it
otherwise
the
knowledge
that
he
was
locked
in
the
room
with
this
mysterious
creature
beyond
all
possibility
of
escape
must
have
frightened
him
as
the
saying
is
out
of
his
skin
as
it
was
however
he
kept
his
head
in
a
wonderful
manner
and
simply
stared
at
the
silent
intruder
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
stare
how
in
the
world
it
got
in
was
the
principal
thought
in
his
mind
and
after
that
what
in
the
world
was
it
the
dawn
must
have
come
very
swiftly
or
else
he
had
been
staring
longer
than
he
knew
for
just
then
the
sun
topped
the
edge
of
the
world
and
the
simultaneously
and
sent
a
welcome
ray
of
sunshine
into
the
dingy
room
it
turned
the
grey
light
to
silver
and
fell
full
upon
the
huddled
figure
crouching
against
the
opposite
wall
jimbo
caught
his
breath
and
stared
harder
than
ever
it
was
a
human
figure
the
figure
apparently
of
a
man
sitting
crumpled
up
in
a
very
uncomfortable
sort
of
position
on
his
haunches
it
sat
perfectly
still
a
black
cloak
with
loose
sleeves
and
a
cowl
or
hood
that
completely
concealed
the
face
covered
it
from
head
to
foot
the
material
of
the
cloak
could
not
have
been
very
thick
for
inside
the
hood
he
caught
the
gleam
of
eyes
as
they
roamed
about
the
room
and
followed
his
movements
but
for
this
glitter
of
the
moving
eyes
it
might
have
been
a
figure
carved
in
wood
was
it
going
to
sit
there
for
ever
watching
him
at
first
he
was
afraid
it
was
going
to
speak
then
he
was
afraid
it
was
it
might
rise
suddenly
and
come
towards
him
yet
the
thought
that
it
would
not
move
at
all
was
worse
still
in
this
way
the
two
faced
each
other
for
several
minutes
until
just
as
the
position
was
becoming
simply
unbearable
a
low
whisper
ran
round
the
room
at
last
oh
i
found
him
at
last
jimbo
was
not
quite
sure
of
the
words
though
it
was
certainly
a
human
voice
that
had
spoken
but
the
suspense
once
broken
the
boy
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
and
with
a
rush
of
desperate
courage
he
found
his
voice
a
very
husky
one
and
moved
a
step
forward
who
are
you
please
and
how
you
get
in
he
ventured
with
a
great
effort
then
he
fell
back
against
the
wall
amazed
at
his
own
daring
and
waited
with
fists
for
an
answer
but
he
had
not
to
wait
very
long
for
almost
immediately
the
figure
rose
awkwardly
to
its
feet
and
came
over
to
where
he
stood
its
manner
of
moving
may
best
be
described
as
shuffling
and
it
stretched
in
front
of
it
a
long
cloaked
arm
on
which
the
sleeve
hung
he
thought
like
clothes
on
a
washing
line
he
breathed
hard
and
waited
like
many
other
people
with
strong
wills
and
sensitive
nerves
jimbo
was
both
brave
and
a
coward
he
hoped
nothing
horrid
was
going
to
happen
but
he
was
quite
ready
if
it
should
yet
now
that
the
actual
moment
had
come
he
had
no
particular
fear
and
when
he
felt
the
touch
of
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
words
sprang
naturally
to
his
lips
with
a
little
trembling
laugh
more
of
wonder
perhaps
than
anything
else
you
do
look
a
horrid
he
was
going
to
say
but
at
the
last
moment
he
changed
it
to
for
with
the
true
intuition
of
a
child
he
recognised
that
the
creature
inside
the
cloak
was
a
kind
creature
and
well
disposed
towards
him
but
how
did
you
get
in
he
added
looking
up
bravely
into
the
black
visage
because
the
doors
are
both
locked
on
the
outside
and
i
could
get
out
by
way
of
reply
the
figure
shuffled
to
one
side
and
taking
the
hand
from
his
shoulder
pointed
silently
to
a
in
the
floor
behind
him
as
he
looked
he
saw
it
was
being
shut
down
stealthily
by
some
one
beneath
hush
whispered
the
figure
almost
inaudibly
he
watching
who
watching
he
cried
curiosity
taking
the
place
of
every
other
emotion
i
want
to
see
he
ran
forward
to
the
spot
where
the
now
lay
flush
with
the
floor
but
before
he
had
gone
two
steps
the
black
arms
shot
out
and
caught
him
he
turned
struggling
and
in
the
scuffle
that
followed
the
cloak
shrouding
the
figure
became
disarranged
the
hood
dropped
from
the
face
and
he
found
himself
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
not
of
a
man
but
of
a
woman
it
you
he
cried
you
a
shock
ran
right
through
his
body
from
his
head
to
his
feet
like
a
current
of
electricity
and
he
caught
his
breath
as
though
he
had
been
struck
for
one
brief
instant
the
sinister
face
of
some
one
who
had
terrified
him
in
the
past
came
back
vividly
to
his
mind
and
he
shrank
away
in
terror
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
the
twentieth
part
of
an
instant
immediately
before
he
could
even
remember
the
name
recognition
passed
into
darkness
and
his
memory
shut
down
with
a
snap
he
was
staring
into
the
face
of
an
utter
stranger
about
whom
he
knew
nothing
and
had
no
feelings
particularly
one
way
or
another
i
thought
i
knew
you
he
gasped
but
i
forgotten
you
again
and
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
a
man
too
jimbo
cried
the
other
and
in
her
voice
was
such
unmistakable
tenderness
and
yearning
that
the
boy
knew
at
once
beyond
doubt
that
she
was
his
friend
jimbo
she
knelt
down
on
the
floor
beside
him
so
that
her
face
was
on
a
level
with
his
and
then
opened
both
her
arms
to
him
but
though
jimbo
was
glad
to
have
found
a
friend
who
was
going
to
help
him
he
felt
no
particular
desire
to
be
embraced
and
he
stood
obstinately
where
he
was
with
his
back
to
the
window
the
morning
sunshine
fell
upon
her
features
and
touched
the
thick
coils
of
her
hair
with
glory
it
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
pretty
face
but
the
look
of
real
human
tenderness
there
was
very
welcome
and
comforting
and
in
the
kind
brown
eyes
there
shone
a
strange
light
that
was
not
merely
the
reflection
of
the
sunlight
the
boy
felt
his
heart
warm
to
her
as
he
looked
but
her
expression
puzzled
him
and
he
would
not
accept
the
invitation
of
her
arms
wo
you
come
to
me
she
said
her
arms
still
outstretched
i
want
to
know
who
you
are
and
what
i
doing
here
he
said
i
feel
so
funny
so
old
and
so
young
and
all
mixed
up
i
ca
make
out
who
i
am
a
bit
what
that
funny
name
you
call
me
jimbo
is
your
name
she
said
softly
then
what
name
he
asked
quickly
my
name
she
repeated
slowly
after
a
pause
is
not
as
nice
as
yours
besides
you
need
not
know
my
name
you
might
dislike
it
but
i
must
have
something
to
call
you
he
persisted
but
if
i
told
you
and
you
disliked
the
name
you
might
dislike
too
she
said
still
hesitating
jimbo
saw
the
expression
of
sadness
in
her
eyes
and
it
won
his
confidence
though
he
hardly
knew
why
he
came
up
closer
to
her
and
put
his
puzzled
little
face
next
to
hers
i
like
you
very
much
already
he
whispered
and
if
your
name
is
a
horrid
one
i
change
it
for
you
at
once
please
tell
me
what
it
is
she
drew
the
boy
to
her
and
gave
him
a
little
hug
and
he
did
not
resist
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
answer
he
felt
vaguely
that
something
of
dreadful
importance
hung
about
this
revelation
of
her
name
he
repeated
his
question
and
at
length
she
replied
speaking
in
a
very
low
voice
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
his
face
my
name
she
said
is
ethel
lake
ethel
lake
he
repeated
after
her
the
words
sounded
somehow
familiar
to
him
surely
he
had
heard
that
name
before
were
not
the
words
associated
with
something
in
his
past
that
had
been
unpleasant
a
curious
sinking
sensation
came
over
him
as
he
heard
them
his
companion
watched
him
intently
while
he
repeated
the
words
over
to
himself
several
times
as
if
to
make
sure
he
had
got
them
right
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
as
he
slowly
went
over
them
once
again
then
he
turned
to
her
laughing
i
like
your
name
ethel
lake
he
said
it
a
nice
name
miss
miss
again
he
hesitated
while
a
little
warning
tremor
ran
through
his
mind
and
he
wondered
for
an
instant
why
he
said
miss
but
it
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
and
he
finished
the
sentence
miss
lake
i
shall
call
you
he
stared
into
her
eyes
as
he
said
it
then
you
do
remember
me
at
all
she
cried
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
you
quite
forgotten
i
never
saw
you
before
did
i
how
can
i
remember
you
i
do
remember
any
of
the
things
i
forgotten
are
you
one
of
them
for
reply
she
caught
him
to
her
breast
and
kissed
him
you
precious
little
boy
she
said
i
so
glad
oh
so
glad
but
do
you
remember
he
asked
sorely
puzzled
who
am
i
i
been
born
yet
or
something
funny
like
that
if
you
do
remember
said
the
other
her
face
happy
with
smiles
that
had
evidently
come
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
tears
not
much
good
telling
you
who
are
but
your
name
if
you
really
want
to
know
is
she
hesitated
a
moment
be
quick
eth
miss
lake
or
you
forget
it
again
she
laughed
rather
bitterly
oh
i
never
forget
i
ca
she
said
i
wish
i
could
your
name
is
james
stone
and
jimbo
is
for
james
now
you
know
she
might
just
as
well
have
said
bill
sykes
for
all
the
boy
knew
or
remembered
what
a
silly
name
he
laughed
but
it
ca
be
my
real
name
or
i
should
know
it
i
never
heard
it
before
after
a
moment
he
added
am
i
an
old
man
i
feel
just
like
one
i
suppose
i
grown
up
grown
up
so
fast
that
i
forgotten
what
came
before
you
not
grown
up
dear
at
least
not
exactly
she
glanced
down
at
his
alpaca
knickerbockers
and
brown
stockings
and
as
he
followed
her
eyes
and
saw
the
dirty
there
came
into
his
mind
some
dim
memory
of
where
he
had
last
put
them
on
and
of
some
one
who
had
helped
him
but
it
all
passed
like
a
swift
meteor
across
the
dark
night
of
his
forgetfulness
and
was
lost
in
mist
you
must
judge
by
these
silly
clothes
he
laughed
i
shall
change
them
as
soon
as
i
get
as
soon
as
i
can
find
he
stopped
short
no
words
came
a
feeling
of
utter
loneliness
and
despair
swept
suddenly
over
him
drenching
him
from
head
to
foot
he
felt
lost
and
friendless
naked
homeless
cold
he
was
ever
on
the
brink
of
regaining
a
whole
lot
of
knowledge
and
experience
that
he
had
known
once
long
ago
ever
so
long
ago
but
it
always
kept
just
out
of
his
reach
he
glanced
at
miss
lake
feeling
that
she
was
his
only
possible
comfort
in
a
terrible
situation
she
met
his
look
and
drew
him
tenderly
towards
her
now
listen
to
me
she
said
gently
i
something
to
tell
you
about
myself
he
was
all
attention
in
a
minute
i
am
a
discharged
governess
she
began
holding
her
breath
when
once
the
words
were
out
discharged
he
repeated
vaguely
what
that
what
for
for
frightening
a
child
i
told
a
little
boy
awful
stories
that
true
they
terrified
him
so
much
that
i
was
sent
away
that
why
here
now
it
my
punishment
i
am
a
prisoner
here
until
i
can
find
him
and
help
him
to
escape
oh
i
say
he
exclaimed
quickly
as
though
remembering
something
but
it
passed
and
he
looked
up
at
her
escape
from
what
he
asked
from
here
this
is
the
empty
house
i
told
the
stories
about
you
are
the
little
boy
i
now
at
last
i
found
you
and
am
going
to
save
you
she
paused
watching
him
with
eyes
that
never
left
his
face
for
an
instant
jimbo
was
delighted
to
hear
he
was
going
to
be
rescued
but
he
felt
no
interest
at
all
in
her
story
of
having
frightened
a
little
boy
who
was
himself
he
thought
it
was
very
nice
of
her
to
take
so
much
trouble
and
he
told
her
so
and
when
he
went
up
and
kissed
her
and
thanked
her
he
saw
to
his
surprise
that
she
was
crying
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
understand
why
a
discharged
governess
whom
he
met
apparently
for
the
first
time
in
the
empty
house
should
weep
over
him
and
show
him
so
much
affection
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
so
he
just
waited
till
she
had
finished
you
see
if
i
can
save
you
she
said
between
her
sobs
it
will
be
all
right
again
and
i
shall
be
forgiven
and
shall
be
able
to
escape
with
you
i
want
you
to
escape
so
that
you
can
get
back
to
life
again
oh
then
i
dead
am
i
not
exactly
dead
she
said
drying
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
black
hood
you
had
a
funny
accident
you
know
if
your
body
gets
all
right
so
that
you
can
go
back
and
live
in
it
again
then
you
not
dead
but
if
it
so
badly
injured
that
you
ca
work
in
it
any
more
then
you
are
dead
and
will
have
to
stay
dead
you
still
joined
to
the
body
in
a
fashion
you
see
he
stared
and
listened
not
understanding
much
it
all
bored
him
she
talked
without
explaining
he
thought
an
immense
sponge
had
passed
over
the
slate
of
the
past
and
wiped
it
clean
beyond
recall
he
was
utterly
perplexed
how
funny
you
are
he
said
vaguely
thinking
more
of
her
tears
than
her
explanations
water
wo
stay
in
a
cracked
bottle
she
went
on
and
you
ca
stay
in
a
broken
body
but
they
trying
to
mend
it
now
and
if
we
can
escape
in
time
you
can
be
an
ordinary
happy
little
boy
in
the
world
again
then
are
you
dead
too
he
asked
or
nearly
dead
i
am
out
of
my
body
like
you
she
answered
evasively
after
a
moment
pause
he
was
still
looking
at
her
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
when
she
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
let
the
hood
drop
back
over
her
face
hush
she
whispered
he
listening
again
at
the
same
moment
a
sound
came
from
beneath
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
jimbo
saw
the
being
slowly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
floor
your
number
is
said
a
voice
that
sounded
like
the
rushing
of
a
river
instantly
the
dropped
again
and
he
heard
heavy
steps
rumbling
away
into
the
interior
of
the
house
he
looked
at
his
companion
and
saw
her
terrified
face
as
she
lifted
her
hood
he
always
blunders
along
like
that
she
whispered
bending
her
head
on
one
side
to
listen
he
ca
see
properly
in
the
daylight
he
hates
sunshine
and
usually
only
goes
out
after
dark
she
was
white
and
trembling
is
that
the
person
who
brought
me
in
here
this
morning
at
such
a
frightful
pace
he
asked
bewildered
she
nodded
he
wanted
to
get
in
before
it
was
light
so
that
you
could
see
his
face
is
he
such
a
fright
asked
the
boy
beginning
to
share
her
evident
feeling
of
horror
he
fright
she
said
in
an
awed
whisper
but
never
talk
about
him
again
unless
you
ca
help
it
he
always
knows
when
he
being
talked
about
and
he
likes
it
because
it
gives
him
more
power
jimbo
only
stared
at
her
without
comprehending
then
his
mind
jumped
to
something
else
he
wanted
badly
to
have
explained
and
he
asked
her
about
his
number
and
why
he
was
called
no
oh
that
easier
she
said
is
your
number
among
the
frightened
children
there
are
of
them
and
you
are
the
last
arrival
you
seen
them
yet
it
is
also
the
temperature
of
your
broken
little
body
lying
on
the
bed
in
the
night
nursery
at
home
she
added
though
he
hardly
caught
her
words
so
low
were
they
spoken
jimbo
then
described
how
the
children
had
sung
and
danced
to
him
and
went
on
to
ask
a
hundred
questions
about
them
but
miss
lake
would
give
him
very
little
information
and
said
he
would
not
have
very
much
to
do
with
them
most
of
them
had
been
in
the
house
for
years
and
years
so
long
that
they
could
probably
never
escape
at
all
they
are
all
frightened
children
she
said
little
ones
scared
out
of
their
wits
by
silly
people
who
meant
to
amuse
them
with
stories
or
to
frighten
them
into
being
well
behaved
elder
sisters
and
even
governesses
and
they
can
never
escape
not
unless
the
people
who
frightened
them
come
to
their
rescue
and
the
risk
of
being
caught
as
she
spoke
there
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
house
the
sound
of
muffled
voices
children
voices
singing
faintly
together
it
rose
and
fell
exactly
like
the
wind
and
with
as
little
tune
it
was
weird
and
magical
but
so
utterly
mournful
that
the
boy
felt
the
tears
start
to
his
eyes
it
drifted
away
too
just
as
the
wind
does
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
dying
into
the
distance
and
all
became
still
again
it
just
like
the
wind
he
said
and
i
do
love
the
wind
it
makes
me
feel
so
sad
and
so
happy
why
is
it
the
governess
did
not
answer
how
old
am
i
he
went
on
how
can
i
be
so
old
and
so
ignorant
i
forgotten
such
an
awful
lot
of
knowledge
the
fact
is
well
perhaps
you
wo
quite
understand
but
really
two
ages
at
once
sometimes
you
feel
as
old
as
your
body
and
sometimes
as
old
as
your
soul
you
still
connected
with
your
body
so
you
get
the
sensations
of
both
mixed
up
then
is
the
body
younger
than
the
soul
the
soul
that
is
yourself
she
answered
is
oh
so
old
awfully
old
as
old
as
the
stars
and
older
but
the
body
is
no
older
than
itself
of
course
how
could
it
be
of
course
repeated
the
boy
who
was
not
listening
to
a
word
she
said
how
could
it
be
but
it
does
matter
how
old
you
are
or
how
young
you
feel
as
long
as
you
do
hate
me
for
having
frightened
you
she
said
after
a
pause
that
the
chief
thing
he
was
very
very
puzzled
he
could
not
help
feeling
it
had
been
rather
unkind
of
her
to
frighten
him
so
badly
that
he
had
literally
been
frightened
out
of
his
skin
but
he
could
remember
anything
about
it
and
she
was
taking
so
much
trouble
to
save
him
now
that
he
quite
forgave
her
he
nestled
up
against
her
and
said
of
course
he
liked
her
and
she
stroked
his
curly
head
and
mumbled
a
lot
of
things
to
herself
that
he
could
understand
a
bit
but
in
spite
of
his
friend
the
feeling
of
loneliness
would
suddenly
rush
over
him
she
might
be
a
protector
but
she
was
not
a
companion
and
he
knew
that
somewhere
or
other
he
had
left
a
lot
of
other
companions
whom
he
now
missed
dreadfully
he
longed
more
than
he
could
say
for
freedom
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
to
play
about
in
a
garden
somewhere
as
of
old
to
wander
over
soft
green
lawns
among
laburnums
and
lilac
trees
and
to
be
up
to
all
his
old
tricks
and
mischief
though
he
could
not
remember
in
detail
what
they
were
in
a
word
he
wanted
to
escape
his
whole
being
yearned
to
escape
and
be
free
again
yet
here
he
was
a
wretched
prisoner
in
a
room
like
a
with
a
sort
of
monster
for
a
keeper
and
a
troop
of
horrible
frightened
children
somewhere
else
in
the
house
to
keep
him
company
and
outside
there
was
only
a
hard
narrow
paved
courtyard
with
a
high
wall
round
it
oh
it
was
too
terrible
to
think
of
and
his
heart
sank
down
within
him
till
he
felt
as
if
he
could
do
nothing
else
but
cry
i
shall
save
you
in
time
whispered
the
governess
as
though
she
read
his
thoughts
you
must
be
patient
and
do
what
i
tell
you
and
i
promise
to
get
you
out
only
be
brave
and
do
ask
too
many
questions
we
shall
win
in
the
end
and
escape
suddenly
he
looked
up
with
quite
a
new
expression
in
his
face
but
i
say
miss
cake
i
frightfully
hungry
i
had
nothing
to
eat
since
i
ca
remember
when
but
ever
so
long
ago
you
need
call
me
miss
cake
though
she
laughed
i
suppose
it
because
i
so
hungry
then
you
call
me
miss
lake
when
you
thirsty
perhaps
she
said
but
anyhow
i
see
what
i
can
get
you
only
you
must
eat
as
little
as
possible
i
want
you
to
get
very
thin
what
you
feel
is
not
really
hunger
it
only
a
memory
of
hunger
and
you
soon
get
used
to
it
he
stared
at
her
with
a
very
distressful
little
face
as
she
crossed
the
room
making
this
new
announcement
and
just
as
she
disappeared
through
the
only
her
head
being
visible
she
added
with
great
emphasis
the
thinner
you
get
the
better
because
the
thinner
you
are
the
lighter
you
are
and
the
lighter
you
are
the
easier
it
will
be
to
escape
remember
the
thinner
the
better
the
lighter
the
better
and
do
ask
a
lot
of
questions
about
it
with
that
the
closed
over
her
and
jimbo
was
left
alone
with
her
last
strange
words
ringing
in
his
ears
chapter
vii
the
spell
of
the
empty
house
it
was
not
long
before
jimbo
realised
that
the
house
and
everything
connected
with
it
spelt
for
him
one
message
and
one
only
a
message
of
fear
from
the
first
day
of
his
imprisonment
the
forces
of
his
whole
being
shaped
themselves
without
further
ado
into
one
intense
single
concentrated
desire
to
freedom
escape
into
the
world
beyond
that
terrible
high
wall
was
his
only
object
and
miss
lake
the
governess
as
its
symbol
was
his
only
hope
he
asked
a
lot
of
questions
and
listened
to
a
lot
of
answers
but
all
he
really
cared
about
was
how
he
was
going
to
escape
and
when
all
her
other
explanations
were
tedious
and
he
only
to
them
his
faith
in
her
was
absolute
his
patience
unbounded
she
had
come
to
save
him
and
he
knew
that
before
long
she
would
accomplish
her
end
he
felt
a
blind
and
perfect
confidence
but
meanwhile
his
fear
of
the
house
and
his
horror
for
the
secret
being
who
meant
to
keep
him
prisoner
till
at
length
he
became
one
of
the
troop
of
frightened
children
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
presently
the
creaked
again
and
the
governess
reappeared
in
her
hand
was
a
small
white
jug
and
a
soup
plate
thin
gruel
and
skim
milk
she
explained
pouring
out
a
substance
like
paste
into
the
soup
plate
and
handing
him
a
big
wooden
spoon
but
jimbo
hunger
had
somehow
vanished
it
was
real
hunger
she
told
him
but
only
a
sort
of
memory
of
being
hungry
they
trying
to
feed
your
broken
body
now
in
the
and
so
you
feel
a
sort
of
ghostly
hunger
here
even
though
you
out
of
the
body
it
easily
satisfied
at
any
rate
he
said
looking
at
the
paste
in
the
soup
plate
no
one
actually
eats
or
drinks
here
but
i
solid
he
said
am
i
not
people
always
think
they
solid
everywhere
she
laughed
it
only
a
question
of
degree
solidity
means
a
different
thing
to
solidity
i
can
get
thinner
though
ca
i
he
asked
thinking
of
her
remark
about
escape
being
easier
the
lighter
he
grew
she
assured
him
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
that
and
after
replying
evasively
to
a
lot
more
questions
she
gathered
up
the
dishes
and
once
more
disappeared
through
the
jimbo
watched
her
going
down
the
ladder
into
the
black
gulf
below
and
wondered
greatly
where
she
went
to
and
what
she
did
down
there
but
on
these
points
the
governess
had
refused
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
every
time
she
appeared
or
disappeared
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
came
and
went
with
her
as
he
stared
wondering
a
sound
suddenly
made
itself
heard
behind
him
and
on
turning
quickly
round
he
saw
to
his
great
surprise
that
the
door
into
the
passage
was
open
this
was
more
than
he
could
resist
and
in
another
minute
with
mingled
feelings
of
dread
and
delight
he
was
out
in
the
passage
when
he
was
first
brought
to
the
house
two
hours
before
it
had
been
too
dark
to
see
properly
but
now
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
light
still
increasing
he
crept
cautiously
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
peered
over
into
the
well
of
the
house
it
was
still
too
dark
to
make
things
out
clearly
but
as
he
looked
he
thought
something
moved
among
the
shadows
below
and
for
a
moment
his
heart
stood
still
with
fear
a
large
grey
face
seemed
to
be
staring
up
at
him
out
of
the
gloom
he
clutched
the
banisters
and
felt
as
if
he
hardly
had
strength
enough
in
his
legs
to
get
back
to
the
room
he
had
just
left
but
almost
immediately
the
terror
passed
for
he
saw
that
the
face
resolved
itself
into
the
mingling
of
light
and
shadow
and
the
features
after
all
were
of
his
own
creation
he
went
on
slowly
and
stealthily
down
the
staircase
it
was
certainly
an
empty
house
there
were
no
carpets
the
passages
were
cold
and
draughty
the
paper
curled
from
the
damp
walls
leaving
ugly
discoloured
patches
about
cobwebs
hung
in
many
places
from
the
ceiling
the
windows
were
more
or
less
broken
and
all
were
coated
so
thickly
with
dirt
that
the
rain
had
traced
little
furrows
from
top
to
bottom
shadows
hung
about
everywhere
and
jimbo
thought
every
minute
he
saw
moving
figures
but
the
figures
always
resolved
themselves
into
nothing
when
he
looked
closely
he
began
to
wonder
how
far
it
was
safe
to
go
and
why
the
governess
had
arranged
for
the
door
to
be
opened
for
he
felt
sure
it
was
she
who
had
done
this
and
that
it
was
all
right
for
him
to
come
out
fright
she
had
said
was
never
about
in
the
daylight
but
at
the
same
time
something
warned
him
to
be
ready
at
a
moment
notice
to
turn
and
dash
up
the
stairs
again
to
the
room
where
he
was
at
least
comparatively
safe
so
he
moved
along
very
quietly
and
very
cautiously
he
passed
many
rooms
with
the
doors
open
all
empty
and
silent
some
of
them
had
tables
and
chairs
but
no
sign
of
occupation
the
grates
were
black
and
empty
the
walls
blank
the
windows
unshuttered
everywhere
was
only
silence
and
shadows
there
was
no
sign
of
the
frightened
children
or
of
where
they
lived
no
trace
of
another
staircase
leading
to
the
region
where
the
governess
went
when
she
disappeared
down
the
ladder
through
the
only
hushed
listening
cold
silence
and
shadows
that
seemed
for
ever
shifting
from
place
to
place
as
he
moved
past
them
this
illusion
of
people
peering
at
him
from
corners
and
behind
doors
just
ajar
was
very
strong
yet
whenever
he
turned
his
head
to
face
them
lo
they
were
gone
and
the
shadows
rushed
in
to
fill
their
places
the
spell
of
the
empty
house
was
weaving
itself
slowly
and
surely
about
his
heart
yet
he
went
on
pluckily
full
of
a
dreadful
curiosity
continuing
his
search
and
at
length
after
passing
through
another
gloomy
passage
he
was
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
threshold
of
an
open
door
leading
out
into
the
courtyard
when
he
stopped
short
and
clutched
the
with
both
hands
some
one
had
laughed
he
turned
trying
to
look
in
every
direction
at
once
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
being
yet
the
sound
was
close
beside
him
he
could
still
hear
it
ringing
in
his
ears
a
mocking
sort
of
laugh
in
a
harsh
guttural
voice
the
blood
froze
in
his
veins
and
he
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
when
another
voice
sounded
and
his
terror
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
it
was
miss
lake
voice
calling
to
him
over
the
banisters
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
its
tone
was
so
cheerful
that
all
his
courage
came
back
in
a
twinkling
go
out
into
the
yard
she
called
and
play
in
the
sunshine
but
stay
too
long
jimbo
answered
all
right
in
a
rather
feeble
little
voice
and
went
on
down
the
passage
and
out
into
the
yard
the
june
sunshine
lay
hot
and
still
over
the
paved
court
and
he
looked
up
into
the
blue
sky
overhead
as
he
looked
at
the
high
wall
that
closed
it
in
on
three
sides
he
realised
more
than
ever
that
he
was
caught
in
a
monstrous
trap
from
which
there
could
be
no
ordinary
means
of
escape
he
could
never
climb
over
such
a
wall
even
with
a
ladder
he
walked
out
a
little
way
and
noticed
the
rank
weeds
growing
in
patches
in
the
corners
decay
and
neglect
left
everywhere
their
dismal
signs
the
yard
in
spite
of
the
sunlight
seemed
as
gloomy
and
cheerless
as
the
house
itself
in
one
corner
stood
several
little
white
upright
stones
each
about
three
feet
high
there
seemed
to
be
some
writing
on
them
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
going
nearer
to
inspect
when
a
window
opened
and
he
heard
some
one
calling
to
him
in
a
loud
excited
whisper
hst
come
in
jimbo
at
once
quick
run
for
your
life
he
glanced
up
quaking
with
fear
and
saw
the
governess
leaning
out
of
the
open
window
at
another
window
a
little
beyond
her
he
thought
a
number
of
white
little
faces
pressed
against
the
glass
but
he
had
no
time
to
look
more
closely
for
something
in
miss
lake
voice
made
him
turn
and
run
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
as
though
fright
himself
were
close
at
his
heels
he
flew
up
the
three
flights
and
found
the
governess
coming
out
on
the
top
landing
to
meet
him
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
dashed
back
into
the
room
as
if
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
slamming
the
door
behind
her
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
out
she
gasped
breathless
as
himself
almost
and
pale
with
alarm
another
second
and
he
have
had
you
i
found
the
door
open
he
opened
it
on
purpose
she
whispered
looking
quickly
round
the
room
he
meant
you
to
go
out
but
you
called
to
me
to
play
in
the
yard
he
said
i
heard
you
so
of
course
i
thought
it
was
safe
no
she
declared
i
never
called
to
you
that
was
my
voice
that
was
one
of
his
tricks
i
only
this
minute
found
the
door
open
and
you
gone
oh
jimbo
that
was
a
narrow
escape
you
must
never
go
out
of
this
room
till
till
i
tell
you
and
never
believe
any
of
these
voices
you
hear
you
hear
lots
of
them
saying
all
sorts
of
things
but
unless
you
me
do
believe
it
my
voice
jimbo
promised
he
was
very
frightened
but
she
would
not
tell
him
any
more
saying
it
would
only
make
it
more
difficult
to
escape
if
he
knew
too
much
in
advance
he
told
her
about
the
laugh
and
the
gravestones
and
the
faces
at
the
other
window
but
she
would
not
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
at
last
he
gave
up
asking
a
very
deep
impression
had
been
made
on
his
mind
however
and
he
began
to
realise
more
than
he
had
hitherto
done
the
horror
of
his
prison
and
the
power
of
his
dreadful
keeper
but
when
he
began
to
look
about
him
again
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
new
thing
in
the
room
the
governess
had
left
him
and
was
bending
over
it
she
was
doing
something
very
busily
indeed
he
asked
her
what
it
was
i
making
your
bed
she
said
it
was
indeed
a
bed
and
he
felt
as
he
looked
at
it
that
there
was
something
very
familiar
and
friendly
about
the
yellow
framework
and
the
little
brass
knobs
i
brought
it
up
just
now
she
explained
but
it
not
for
sleeping
in
it
only
for
you
to
lie
down
on
and
also
partly
to
deceive
him
why
not
for
sleeping
there
no
sleeping
at
all
here
she
went
on
calmly
why
not
you
ca
sleep
out
of
your
body
she
laughed
why
not
he
asked
again
your
body
goes
to
sleep
but
do
she
explained
oh
i
see
his
head
was
whirling
and
my
body
my
real
body
is
lying
asleep
unconscious
they
call
it
in
the
at
home
it
sound
asleep
that
why
you
here
it
ca
wake
up
till
you
go
back
to
it
and
you
ca
go
back
to
it
till
you
escape
even
if
it
ready
for
you
before
then
the
bed
is
only
for
you
to
rest
on
for
you
can
though
you
ca
jimbo
stared
blankly
at
the
governess
for
some
minutes
he
was
debating
something
in
his
mind
something
very
important
and
just
then
it
was
his
older
self
and
not
the
child
that
was
uppermost
apparently
it
was
soon
decided
for
he
walked
sedately
up
to
her
and
said
very
gravely
with
her
serious
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
miss
lake
are
you
miss
lake
of
course
i
am
you
not
a
trick
of
his
like
the
voices
i
mean
no
jimbo
i
am
really
miss
lake
the
discharged
governess
who
frightened
you
there
was
profound
anxiety
in
every
word
jimbo
waited
a
minute
still
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
then
he
put
out
his
hand
cautiously
and
touched
her
he
rose
a
little
on
tiptoe
to
be
on
a
level
with
her
face
taking
a
fold
of
her
cloak
in
each
hand
the
was
in
his
eyes
just
then
not
the
mere
curiosity
of
the
child
and
are
you
he
asked
sinking
his
voice
to
a
whisper
for
a
moment
the
woman
eyes
wavered
she
turned
white
and
tried
to
move
away
but
the
boy
seized
her
hand
and
peered
more
closely
into
her
face
i
mean
if
we
escape
and
i
get
back
into
my
body
he
whispered
will
you
get
back
into
yours
too
the
governess
made
no
reply
and
shifted
uneasily
on
her
feet
but
the
boy
would
not
let
her
go
please
answer
he
urged
still
in
a
whisper
jimbo
what
funny
questions
you
ask
she
said
at
last
in
a
husky
voice
but
trying
to
smile
but
i
want
to
know
he
said
i
must
know
i
believe
you
are
giving
up
everything
just
to
save
me
and
i
do
want
to
be
saved
unless
you
come
too
tell
me
the
colour
came
back
to
her
cheeks
a
little
and
her
eyes
grew
moist
again
she
tried
to
slip
past
him
but
he
prevented
her
you
must
tell
me
he
urged
i
would
rather
stay
here
with
you
than
escape
back
into
my
body
and
leave
you
behind
jimbo
knew
it
was
his
older
self
speaking
the
freed
spirit
rather
than
the
broken
body
but
he
felt
the
strain
was
very
great
he
could
not
keep
it
up
much
longer
any
minute
he
might
slip
back
into
the
child
again
and
lose
interest
and
be
unequal
to
the
task
he
now
saw
so
clearly
before
him
quick
he
cried
in
a
louder
voice
tell
me
you
are
giving
up
everything
to
save
me
are
you
and
if
i
escape
you
will
be
left
alone
quick
answer
me
oh
be
quick
i
slipping
back
already
he
felt
his
thoughts
becoming
confused
again
as
the
spirit
merged
back
into
the
child
in
another
minute
the
boy
would
usurp
the
older
self
you
see
began
the
governess
at
length
speaking
very
gently
and
sadly
i
am
bound
to
make
amends
whatever
happens
i
must
atone
but
already
he
found
it
hard
to
follow
atone
he
asked
what
does
mean
he
moved
back
a
step
and
glanced
about
the
room
the
moment
of
concentration
had
passed
without
bearing
fruit
his
thoughts
began
to
wander
again
like
a
child
anyhow
we
shall
escape
together
when
the
chance
comes
sha
we
he
said
yes
darling
we
shall
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
and
if
you
do
what
i
tell
you
it
will
come
very
soon
i
hope
she
drew
him
towards
her
and
kissed
him
and
though
he
did
respond
very
heartily
he
felt
he
liked
it
and
was
sure
that
she
was
good
and
meant
to
do
the
best
possible
for
him
jimbo
asked
nothing
more
for
some
time
he
turned
to
the
bed
where
he
found
a
mattress
and
a
blanket
but
no
sheets
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
and
waited
the
governess
was
standing
by
the
window
looking
out
her
back
was
turned
to
him
he
heard
an
occasional
deep
sigh
come
from
her
but
he
was
too
busy
now
with
his
own
sensations
to
trouble
much
about
her
looking
past
her
he
saw
the
sea
of
green
leaves
dancing
lazily
in
the
sunshine
something
seemed
to
beckon
him
from
beyond
the
high
wall
and
he
longed
to
go
out
and
play
in
the
shade
of
the
elms
and
hawthorns
for
the
horror
of
the
empty
house
was
closing
in
upon
him
steadily
but
surely
and
he
longed
for
escape
into
a
bright
unhaunted
atmosphere
more
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
his
thoughts
ran
on
and
on
in
this
vein
till
presently
he
noticed
that
the
governess
was
moving
about
the
room
she
crossed
over
and
tried
first
one
door
and
then
the
other
both
were
fastened
next
she
lifted
the
and
peered
down
into
the
black
hole
below
that
too
apparently
was
satisfactory
then
she
came
over
to
the
bedside
on
tiptoe
jimbo
i
got
something
very
important
to
ask
you
she
began
all
right
he
said
full
of
curiosity
you
must
answer
me
very
exactly
everything
depends
on
it
i
will
she
took
another
long
look
round
the
room
and
then
in
a
still
lower
whisper
bent
over
him
and
asked
have
you
any
pain
where
he
asked
remembering
to
be
exact
anywhere
he
thought
a
moment
none
thank
you
none
at
all
anywhere
she
insisted
none
at
all
anywhere
he
said
with
decision
she
seemed
disappointed
never
mind
it
a
little
soon
yet
perhaps
she
said
we
must
have
patience
it
will
come
in
time
but
i
do
want
any
pain
he
said
rather
ruefully
you
ca
escape
till
it
comes
i
do
understand
a
bit
what
you
mean
he
began
to
feel
alarmed
at
the
notion
of
escape
and
pain
going
together
you
understand
later
though
she
said
soothingly
and
it
hurt
much
the
sooner
the
pain
comes
the
sooner
we
can
try
to
escape
nowhere
can
there
be
escape
without
it
and
with
that
she
left
him
disappearing
without
another
word
into
the
hole
below
the
trap
and
leaving
him
disconsolate
yet
excited
alone
in
the
room
chapter
viii
the
gallery
of
ancient
memories
with
every
one
of
course
the
measurement
of
time
depends
largely
upon
the
state
of
the
emotions
but
in
jimbo
case
it
was
curiously
exaggerated
this
may
have
been
because
he
had
no
standard
of
memory
by
which
to
test
the
succession
of
minutes
but
whatever
it
was
the
hours
passed
very
quickly
and
the
evening
shadows
were
already
darkening
the
room
when
at
length
he
got
up
from
the
mattress
and
went
over
to
the
window
outside
the
high
elms
were
growing
dim
soon
the
stars
would
be
out
in
the
sky
the
afternoon
had
passed
away
like
magic
and
the
governess
still
left
him
alone
he
could
not
quite
understand
why
she
went
away
for
such
long
periods
the
darkness
came
down
very
swiftly
and
it
was
night
almost
before
he
knew
it
yet
he
felt
no
drowsiness
no
desire
to
yawn
and
get
under
sheets
and
blankets
sleep
was
evidently
out
of
the
question
and
the
hours
slipped
away
so
rapidly
that
it
made
little
difference
whether
he
sat
up
all
night
or
whether
he
slept
it
was
his
first
night
in
the
empty
house
and
he
wondered
how
many
more
he
would
spend
there
before
escape
came
he
stood
at
the
window
peering
out
into
the
growing
darkness
and
thinking
long
long
thoughts
below
him
yawned
the
black
gulf
of
the
yard
and
the
outline
of
the
enclosing
wall
was
only
just
visible
but
beyond
the
elms
rose
far
into
the
sky
and
he
could
hear
the
wind
singing
softly
in
their
branches
the
sound
was
very
sweet
it
suggested
freedom
and
the
flight
of
birds
and
all
that
was
wild
and
unrestrained
the
wind
could
never
really
be
a
prisoner
its
voice
sang
of
open
spaces
and
unbounded
distances
of
flying
clouds
and
mountains
of
mighty
woods
and
dancing
waves
above
all
of
wings
free
swift
and
unconquerable
wings
but
this
rushing
song
of
wind
among
the
leaves
made
him
feel
too
sad
to
listen
long
and
he
lay
down
upon
the
bed
again
still
thinking
thinking
the
house
was
utterly
still
not
a
thing
stirred
within
its
walls
he
felt
lonely
and
began
to
long
for
the
companionship
of
the
governess
he
would
have
called
aloud
for
her
to
come
only
he
was
afraid
to
break
the
appalling
silence
he
wondered
where
she
was
all
this
time
and
how
she
spent
the
long
dark
hours
of
the
sleepless
nights
were
all
these
things
really
true
that
she
told
him
was
he
actually
out
of
his
body
and
was
his
name
really
jimbo
his
thoughts
kept
groping
backwards
ever
seeking
the
other
companions
he
had
lost
but
like
a
piece
of
stretched
elastic
too
short
to
reach
its
object
they
always
came
back
with
a
snap
just
when
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
finding
them
he
wanted
these
companions
very
badly
indeed
but
the
struggling
of
his
memory
was
painful
and
he
could
not
keep
the
effort
up
for
very
long
at
one
time
the
effort
once
relaxed
however
his
thoughts
wandered
freely
where
they
would
and
there
rose
before
his
mind
eye
dim
suggestions
of
memories
far
more
distant
ghostly
scenes
and
faces
that
passed
before
him
in
endless
succession
but
always
faded
away
before
he
could
properly
seize
and
name
them
this
memory
so
stubborn
as
regards
quite
recent
events
began
to
play
strange
tricks
with
him
it
carried
him
away
into
a
past
so
remote
that
he
could
not
connect
it
with
himself
at
all
and
it
was
like
dreaming
of
scenes
and
events
that
had
happened
to
some
one
else
yet
all
the
time
he
knew
quite
well
those
things
had
happened
to
him
and
to
none
else
it
was
the
memory
of
the
soul
asserting
itself
now
that
the
clamour
of
the
body
was
low
it
was
an
underground
river
coming
to
the
surface
for
odd
minutes
here
and
there
showing
its
waters
to
the
stars
just
long
enough
to
catch
their
ghostly
reflections
before
it
rolled
away
underground
again
yet
swift
and
transitory
as
they
were
these
glimpses
brought
in
their
train
sensations
that
were
too
powerful
ever
to
have
troubled
his
in
its
present
body
they
stirred
in
him
the
strong
emotions
the
ecstasies
the
terrors
the
yearnings
of
a
much
more
distant
past
whispering
to
him
could
he
but
have
understood
of
an
infinitely
deeper
layer
of
memories
and
experiences
which
now
released
from
the
burden
of
the
immediate
years
strove
to
awaken
into
life
again
the
soul
in
that
little
body
covered
with
alpaca
knickerbockers
and
a
sailor
blouse
seemed
suddenly
to
have
access
to
a
storehouse
of
knowledge
that
must
have
taken
centuries
rather
than
a
few
short
years
to
acquire
it
was
all
very
queer
the
feeling
of
tremendous
age
grew
mysteriously
over
him
he
realised
that
he
had
been
wandering
for
ages
he
had
been
to
the
stars
and
also
to
the
deeps
he
had
roamed
over
strange
mountains
far
away
from
cities
or
inhabited
places
of
the
earth
and
had
lived
by
streams
whose
waves
were
silvered
by
moonlight
dropping
softly
through
whispering
palm
branches
some
of
these
ghostly
memories
brought
him
sensations
of
keenest
happiness
icy
silver
radiant
others
swept
through
his
heart
like
a
cold
wave
leaving
behind
a
feeling
of
unutterable
woe
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
that
almost
made
him
cry
aloud
and
there
came
voices
too
voices
that
had
slept
so
long
in
the
inner
kingdoms
of
silence
that
they
failed
to
rouse
in
him
the
very
slightest
emotion
of
recognition
worn
out
at
length
with
the
surging
of
these
strange
hosts
through
him
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
open
window
again
the
night
was
very
dark
and
warm
but
the
stars
had
disappeared
and
there
was
the
hush
and
the
faint
odour
of
coming
rain
in
the
air
he
smelt
leaves
and
the
earth
and
the
moist
things
of
the
ground
the
wonderful
perfume
of
the
life
of
the
soil
the
wind
had
dropped
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
the
leaves
of
the
elm
trees
were
motionless
no
bird
or
insect
raised
its
voice
everything
slept
he
alone
was
watchful
awake
leaning
over
the
his
thoughts
searched
for
the
governess
and
he
wondered
anew
where
she
was
spending
the
dark
hours
she
too
he
felt
sure
was
wakeful
somewhere
watching
with
him
plotting
their
escape
together
and
always
mindful
of
his
safety
his
reverie
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
flight
of
an
immense
dropping
through
the
air
just
above
his
head
he
sprang
back
into
the
room
with
a
startled
cry
as
it
rushed
past
in
the
darkness
with
a
great
swishing
of
wings
the
size
of
the
creature
filled
him
with
awe
it
was
so
close
that
the
wind
it
made
lifted
the
hair
on
his
forehead
and
he
could
almost
feel
the
feathers
brush
his
cheeks
he
strained
his
eyes
to
try
and
follow
it
but
the
shadows
were
too
deep
and
he
could
see
nothing
only
in
the
distance
growing
every
moment
fainter
he
could
hear
the
noise
of
big
wings
threshing
the
air
he
waited
a
little
wondering
if
another
bird
would
follow
it
or
if
it
would
presently
return
to
its
perch
on
the
roof
and
then
his
thoughts
passed
on
to
uncertain
memories
of
other
big
birds
hawks
owls
eagles
that
he
had
seen
somewhere
in
places
now
beyond
the
reach
of
distinct
recollections
soon
the
light
began
to
dawn
in
the
east
and
he
made
out
the
shape
of
the
elm
trees
and
the
dreadful
prison
wall
and
with
the
first
real
touch
of
morning
light
he
heard
a
familiar
creaking
sound
in
the
room
behind
him
and
saw
the
black
hood
of
the
governess
rising
through
the
in
the
floor
but
you
left
me
alone
all
night
he
said
at
once
reproachfully
as
she
kissed
him
on
purpose
she
answered
he
get
suspicious
if
i
stayed
too
much
with
you
it
different
in
the
daytime
when
he
ca
see
properly
where
he
been
all
night
then
asked
the
boy
last
night
he
was
out
most
of
the
time
hunting
hunting
he
repeated
with
excitement
hunting
what
children
frightened
children
she
replied
lowering
her
voice
that
how
he
found
you
it
was
a
horrible
thought
fright
hunting
for
victims
to
bring
to
his
dreadful
prison
and
jimbo
shivered
as
he
heard
it
and
how
did
you
get
on
all
this
time
she
asked
hurriedly
changing
the
subject
i
been
remembering
that
is
an
awful
lot
of
things
and
feeling
oh
so
old
i
never
want
to
remember
anything
again
he
said
wearily
you
forget
quick
enough
when
you
get
back
into
your
body
and
have
only
the
she
said
with
a
sigh
that
he
did
not
understand
but
now
tell
me
she
added
in
a
more
serious
voice
have
you
had
any
pain
yet
he
shook
his
head
she
stepped
up
beside
him
none
she
asked
touching
him
lightly
just
behind
the
shoulder
blades
jimbo
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
uttered
a
piercing
yell
that
hurts
he
screamed
i
so
glad
cried
the
governess
that
the
pains
coming
at
last
her
face
was
beaming
coming
he
echoed
i
think
they
but
if
they
hurt
as
much
as
that
i
think
i
rather
not
escape
he
added
ruefully
the
pain
wo
last
more
than
a
minute
she
said
calmly
you
must
be
brave
and
stand
it
there
no
escape
without
pain
from
anything
if
there
no
other
way
he
said
pluckily
i
try
but
you
see
she
went
on
rather
absently
at
this
very
moment
the
doctor
is
probing
the
wounds
in
your
back
where
the
horns
went
in
but
he
was
not
listening
her
explanations
always
made
him
want
either
to
cry
or
to
laugh
this
time
he
laughed
and
the
governess
joined
him
while
they
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
together
talking
of
many
things
he
did
not
understand
all
her
explanations
but
it
comforted
him
to
hear
them
so
long
as
somebody
understood
no
matter
who
he
felt
it
was
all
right
in
this
way
several
days
and
nights
passed
quickly
away
the
pains
were
apparently
no
nearer
but
as
miss
lake
showed
no
particular
anxiety
about
their
he
waited
patiently
too
dreading
the
moment
yet
also
looking
forward
to
it
exceedingly
during
the
day
the
governess
spent
most
of
the
time
in
the
room
with
him
but
at
night
when
he
was
alone
the
darkness
became
enchanted
the
room
haunted
and
he
passed
into
the
long
long
gallery
of
ancient
memories
chapter
ix
the
means
of
escape
a
week
passed
and
jimbo
began
to
wonder
if
the
pains
he
so
much
dreaded
yet
so
eagerly
longed
for
were
ever
coming
at
all
the
imprisonment
was
telling
upon
him
and
he
grew
very
thin
and
consequently
very
light
the
nights
though
he
spent
them
alone
were
easily
borne
for
he
was
then
intensely
occupied
and
the
time
passed
swiftly
the
moment
it
was
dark
he
stepped
into
the
gallery
of
memories
and
in
a
little
while
passed
into
a
new
world
of
wonder
and
delight
but
the
daytime
seemed
always
long
he
stood
for
hours
by
the
window
watching
the
trees
and
the
sky
and
what
he
saw
always
set
painful
currents
running
through
his
blood
unsatisfied
longings
yearnings
and
immense
desires
he
never
could
understand
the
white
clouds
on
their
swift
journeys
took
with
them
something
from
his
heart
every
time
he
looked
upon
them
they
melted
into
air
and
blue
sky
and
lo
that
something
came
back
to
him
charged
with
all
the
wild
freedom
and
magic
of
open
spaces
distance
and
rushing
winds
but
the
change
was
close
at
hand
one
night
as
he
was
standing
by
the
open
window
listening
to
the
drip
of
the
rain
he
felt
a
deadly
weakness
steal
over
him
the
strength
went
out
of
his
legs
first
he
turned
hot
and
then
he
turned
cold
clammy
perspiration
broke
out
all
over
him
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
crawl
across
the
room
and
throw
himself
on
to
the
bed
but
no
sooner
was
he
stretched
out
on
the
mattress
than
the
feelings
passed
entirely
and
left
behind
them
an
intoxicating
sense
of
strength
and
lightness
his
muscles
became
like
steel
springs
his
bones
were
strong
as
iron
and
light
as
cork
a
wonderful
vigour
had
suddenly
come
into
him
and
he
felt
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
from
a
dungeon
into
fresh
air
he
was
ready
to
face
anything
in
the
world
but
before
he
had
time
to
realise
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
new
sensations
a
stinging
blinding
pain
shot
suddenly
through
his
right
shoulder
as
if
a
iron
had
pierced
to
the
very
bone
he
screamed
out
in
agony
though
even
while
he
screamed
the
pain
passed
then
the
same
thing
happened
in
his
other
shoulder
it
shot
through
his
back
with
equal
swiftness
and
was
gone
leaving
him
lying
on
the
bed
trembling
with
pain
but
the
instant
it
was
gone
the
delightful
sensations
of
strength
and
lightness
returned
and
he
felt
as
if
his
whole
body
were
charged
with
some
new
and
potent
force
the
pains
had
come
at
last
jimbo
had
no
notion
how
they
could
possibly
be
connected
with
escape
but
miss
lake
his
kind
and
faithful
friend
miss
lake
had
said
that
no
escape
was
possible
without
them
and
had
promised
that
they
should
be
brief
and
this
was
true
for
the
entire
episode
had
not
taken
a
minute
of
time
escape
escape
the
words
rushed
through
him
like
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
this
dreadful
empty
house
into
the
open
spaces
beyond
the
prison
wall
out
where
the
wind
and
the
rain
could
touch
him
where
he
could
feel
the
grass
beneath
his
feet
and
could
see
the
whole
sky
at
once
instead
of
this
narrow
strip
through
the
window
his
thoughts
flew
to
the
stars
and
the
clouds
but
a
strange
humming
of
voices
interrupted
his
flight
of
imagination
and
he
saw
that
the
room
was
suddenly
full
of
moving
figures
they
were
passing
before
him
with
silent
footsteps
across
the
window
from
door
to
door
how
they
had
come
in
or
how
they
went
out
he
never
knew
but
his
heart
stood
still
for
an
instant
as
he
recognised
the
mournful
figures
of
the
frightened
children
filing
before
him
in
a
slow
procession
they
were
singing
though
it
sounded
more
like
a
chorus
of
whispering
than
actual
singing
and
as
they
moved
past
with
the
measured
steps
of
their
sorrowful
dance
he
caught
the
words
of
the
song
he
had
heard
them
sing
when
he
first
came
into
the
house
we
hear
the
little
voices
in
the
wind
singing
of
freedom
we
may
never
find
jimbo
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
but
still
the
sound
came
through
he
heard
the
words
almost
as
if
they
were
inside
himself
his
own
thoughts
singing
we
hear
the
little
footsteps
in
the
rain
running
to
help
us
though
they
run
in
vain
tapping
in
hundreds
on
the
the
horrible
procession
filed
past
and
melted
away
near
the
door
they
were
gone
as
mysteriously
as
they
had
come
and
almost
before
he
realised
it
he
sprang
from
the
bed
and
tried
the
doors
both
were
locked
how
in
the
world
had
the
children
got
in
and
out
the
whispering
voices
rose
again
on
the
night
air
and
this
time
he
was
sure
they
came
from
outside
he
ran
to
the
open
window
and
thrust
his
head
out
cautiously
sure
enough
the
procession
was
moving
slowly
still
with
the
steps
of
that
impish
dance
across
the
courtyard
stones
he
could
just
make
out
the
slow
waving
arms
the
thin
bodies
and
the
white
little
faces
as
they
passed
on
silent
feet
through
the
darkness
and
again
a
fragment
of
the
song
rose
to
his
ears
as
he
watched
and
filled
him
with
an
overpowering
sadness
we
have
no
joy
in
any
children
game
for
happiness
to
us
is
but
a
name
since
terror
kissed
us
with
his
lips
of
flame
then
he
noticed
that
the
group
was
growing
smaller
already
the
numbers
were
less
somewhere
over
there
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
yard
the
children
disappeared
though
it
was
too
dark
to
see
precisely
how
or
where
we
dance
with
phantoms
and
with
shadows
play
rose
to
his
ears
suddenly
he
remembered
the
little
white
upright
stones
he
had
seen
in
that
corner
of
the
yard
and
understood
one
by
one
they
vanished
just
behind
those
stones
jimbo
shivered
and
drew
his
head
in
he
did
not
like
those
upright
stones
they
made
him
uncomfortable
and
afraid
now
however
the
last
child
had
disappeared
and
the
song
had
ceased
he
realised
what
his
fate
would
be
if
the
escape
were
not
successful
he
would
become
one
of
this
band
of
frightened
children
dwelling
somewhere
behind
the
upright
stones
a
terrified
shadow
waiting
in
vain
to
be
rescued
waiting
perhaps
for
ever
and
ever
the
thought
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
but
he
somehow
managed
to
choke
them
down
he
knew
it
was
the
young
portion
of
him
only
that
felt
afraid
the
body
the
older
self
could
not
feel
fear
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
tears
he
lay
down
again
upon
the
hard
mattress
and
waited
and
soon
afterwards
the
first
crimson
streaks
of
sunrise
appeared
behind
the
high
elms
and
rooks
began
to
caw
and
shake
their
wings
in
the
upper
branches
a
little
later
the
governess
came
in
before
he
could
move
out
of
the
way
for
he
disliked
being
embraced
she
had
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
was
covering
him
with
kisses
he
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
you
darling
jimbo
she
cried
they
come
at
last
how
do
you
know
he
asked
surprised
at
her
knowledge
and
puzzled
by
her
display
of
emotion
i
heard
you
scream
to
begin
with
besides
i
been
watching
watching
yes
and
listening
too
every
night
every
single
night
you
hardly
been
a
minute
out
of
my
sight
she
added
i
think
it
awfully
good
of
you
he
said
doubtfully
but
a
flood
of
questions
followed
about
the
upright
stones
the
shadowy
children
where
she
spent
the
night
watching
him
and
a
hundred
other
things
besides
but
he
got
little
satisfaction
out
of
her
he
never
did
when
it
was
jimbo
the
child
that
asked
and
he
remained
jimbo
the
child
all
that
day
she
only
told
him
that
all
was
going
well
the
pains
had
come
he
had
grown
nice
and
thin
and
light
the
children
had
come
into
his
room
as
a
hint
that
he
belonged
to
their
band
and
other
things
had
happened
about
which
she
would
tell
him
later
the
crisis
was
close
at
hand
that
was
all
he
could
get
out
of
her
it
wo
be
long
now
she
said
excitedly
they
come
i
expect
what
will
come
he
asked
with
querulous
wonder
wait
and
see
was
all
the
answer
he
got
wait
and
see
she
told
him
to
lie
quietly
on
the
bed
and
to
have
patience
with
asking
questions
and
thinking
and
wondering
the
day
passed
very
quickly
with
the
lengthening
shadows
his
excitement
began
to
grow
presently
miss
lake
took
her
departure
and
went
off
to
her
unknown
and
mysterious
abode
he
watched
her
disappear
through
the
floor
with
mingled
feelings
wondering
what
would
have
happened
before
he
saw
her
again
she
gave
him
a
long
last
look
as
she
sank
away
below
the
boards
but
it
was
a
look
that
brought
him
fresh
courage
and
her
eyes
were
happy
and
smiling
tingling
already
with
expectancy
he
got
into
the
bed
and
lay
down
his
brain
alive
with
one
word
escape
from
where
he
lay
he
saw
the
stars
in
the
narrow
strip
of
sky
he
heard
the
wind
whispering
in
the
branches
he
even
smelt
the
perfume
of
the
fields
and
hedges
grass
flowers
dew
and
the
sweet
earth
the
odours
of
freedom
the
governess
had
for
some
reason
she
refused
to
explain
taken
his
blouse
away
with
her
for
a
long
time
he
puzzled
over
this
seeking
reasons
and
finding
none
but
while
in
the
act
of
stroking
his
bare
arms
the
pains
of
the
night
before
suddenly
returned
to
both
shoulders
at
once
fire
seemed
to
run
down
his
back
splitting
his
bones
apart
and
then
passed
even
more
quickly
than
before
leaving
him
with
the
same
wonderful
sensations
of
lightness
and
strength
he
felt
inclined
to
shout
and
run
and
jump
and
it
was
only
the
memory
of
the
earnest
caution
to
lie
quietly
that
prevented
his
new
emotions
passing
into
acts
with
very
great
effort
he
lay
still
all
night
long
and
it
was
only
when
the
room
at
last
began
to
get
light
again
that
he
turned
on
his
side
preparatory
to
getting
up
but
there
was
something
new
something
different
he
rested
on
his
elbow
waiting
something
had
happened
to
him
cautiously
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
stretched
out
one
foot
and
touched
the
floor
excitement
ran
through
him
like
a
wave
there
was
a
great
change
a
tremendous
change
for
as
he
stepped
out
gingerly
on
to
the
floor
followed
him
from
the
it
clung
to
his
back
it
touched
both
shoulders
at
once
it
stroked
his
ribs
and
tickled
the
skin
of
his
arms
half
frightened
he
brought
the
other
leg
over
and
stood
boldly
upright
on
both
feet
but
the
weight
still
clung
to
his
back
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
yes
it
was
trailing
after
him
from
the
bed
it
was
and
brilliant
in
colour
he
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
it
it
was
soft
and
glossy
then
he
took
it
deliberately
between
his
fingers
it
was
smooth
as
velvet
and
had
numerous
tiny
ribs
running
along
it
seizing
it
at
last
with
all
his
courage
he
pulled
it
forward
in
front
of
him
for
a
better
view
only
to
discover
that
it
would
not
come
out
beyond
a
certain
distance
and
seemed
to
have
got
caught
somehow
between
his
shoulders
just
where
the
pains
had
been
a
second
pull
more
vigorous
than
the
first
showed
that
it
was
not
caught
but
to
his
skin
it
divided
itself
moreover
into
two
portions
one
half
coming
from
each
shoulder
i
do
believe
they
feathers
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
almost
popping
out
of
his
head
then
with
a
sudden
flash
of
comprehension
he
saw
it
all
and
understood
they
were
indeed
feathers
but
they
were
something
more
than
feathers
merely
were
wings
jimbo
caught
his
breath
and
stared
in
silence
he
felt
dazed
then
bit
by
bit
the
fragments
of
the
weird
mosaic
fell
into
their
proper
places
and
he
began
to
understand
escape
was
to
be
by
flight
it
filled
him
with
such
a
whirlwind
of
delight
and
excitement
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
from
screaming
aloud
lost
in
wonder
he
took
a
step
forward
and
watched
with
bulging
eyes
how
the
wings
followed
him
their
tips
trailing
along
the
floor
they
were
a
beautiful
deep
red
and
hung
down
close
and
warm
beside
his
body
glossy
sleek
magical
and
when
later
the
sun
burst
into
the
room
and
turned
their
colour
into
living
flame
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
kiss
them
he
seized
them
and
rubbed
their
soft
surfaces
over
his
face
such
colours
he
had
never
seen
before
and
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
they
really
belonged
to
him
and
were
intended
for
actual
use
slowly
without
using
his
hands
he
raised
them
into
the
air
the
effort
was
a
perfectly
easy
muscular
effort
from
the
shoulders
that
came
naturally
though
he
did
not
quite
understand
how
he
accomplished
it
the
wings
rose
in
a
fine
graceful
sweep
curving
over
his
head
till
the
tips
of
the
feathers
met
touching
the
walls
as
they
rose
and
almost
reaching
to
the
ceiling
he
gave
a
howl
of
delight
for
this
sight
was
more
than
he
could
manage
without
some
outlet
for
his
emotion
and
at
the
same
moment
the
shot
open
and
the
governess
came
into
the
room
with
such
a
bang
and
a
clatter
that
jimbo
knew
at
once
her
excitement
was
as
great
as
his
own
in
her
hands
she
carried
the
blouse
she
had
taken
away
the
night
before
she
held
it
out
to
him
without
a
word
her
eyes
were
shining
like
electric
lamps
in
less
than
a
second
he
had
slipped
his
wings
through
the
slits
but
before
he
could
practise
them
again
miss
lake
rushed
over
to
him
her
face
radiant
with
happiness
jimbo
my
darling
jimbo
she
cried
and
then
stopped
short
apparently
unable
to
express
her
emotion
the
next
instant
he
was
enveloped
wings
and
all
in
a
warm
confusion
of
kisses
congratulations
and
folds
of
hood
when
they
became
disentangled
again
the
governess
went
down
on
her
knees
and
made
a
careful
examination
she
pulled
the
wings
out
to
their
full
extent
and
found
that
they
stretched
about
four
feet
and
a
half
from
tip
to
tip
they
beauties
she
exclaimed
enthusiastically
and
full
grown
and
strong
i
not
surprised
they
took
so
long
coming
long
he
echoed
i
thought
they
came
awfully
quickly
not
half
so
quickly
as
they
go
she
interrupted
adding
when
she
saw
his
expression
of
dismay
i
mean
you
fly
like
the
wind
with
them
jimbo
was
simply
breathless
with
excitement
he
wanted
to
jump
out
of
the
window
and
escape
at
once
the
blue
sky
and
the
sunshine
and
the
white
flying
clouds
sent
him
an
irresistible
invitation
he
could
not
wait
a
minute
longer
quick
he
cried
i
ca
wait
they
may
go
again
show
me
how
to
use
them
oh
do
show
me
i
show
you
everything
in
time
she
answered
there
was
something
in
her
voice
that
made
him
pause
in
his
excitement
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
some
minutes
but
how
are
going
to
escape
he
asked
at
length
you
got
he
stopped
short
the
governess
stepped
back
a
few
paces
from
him
she
threw
back
the
hood
from
her
face
then
she
lifted
the
long
black
cloak
that
hung
like
a
cassock
almost
to
her
ankles
and
had
always
enveloped
her
hitherto
jimbo
stared
falling
from
her
shoulders
and
folding
over
her
hips
he
saw
long
red
feathers
clinging
to
her
and
when
he
dashed
forward
to
touch
them
with
his
hands
he
found
they
were
just
as
sleek
and
smooth
and
glossy
as
his
own
and
you
never
told
me
all
this
time
he
gasped
it
was
safer
not
she
said
you
have
been
stroking
and
feeling
your
shoulders
the
whole
time
and
the
wings
might
never
have
come
at
all
she
spread
out
her
wings
as
she
spoke
to
their
full
extent
they
were
nearly
six
feet
across
and
the
deep
crimson
on
the
under
side
was
so
exquisite
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
that
jimbo
ran
in
and
nestled
beneath
the
feathers
tickling
his
cheeks
with
the
fluffy
surface
and
running
his
fingers
with
childish
delight
along
the
slender
red
quills
you
precious
child
she
said
tenderly
folding
her
wings
round
him
and
kissing
the
top
of
his
head
always
remember
that
i
really
love
you
no
matter
what
happens
remember
that
and
i
save
you
and
we
shall
escape
together
he
asked
submitting
for
once
to
the
caresses
with
a
good
grace
we
shall
escape
from
the
empty
house
together
she
replied
evasively
how
far
we
can
go
after
that
depends
on
you
on
me
if
you
love
me
enough
as
i
love
you
jimbo
we
can
never
separate
again
because
love
ties
us
together
for
ever
only
she
added
it
must
be
mutual
i
love
you
very
much
he
said
puzzled
a
little
of
course
i
do
if
you
really
forgiven
me
for
being
the
cause
of
your
coming
here
she
said
we
can
always
be
together
but
i
do
remember
but
i
forgiven
you
that
long
ago
he
said
simply
if
you
had
brought
me
here
i
should
never
have
met
you
that
not
real
forgiveness
quite
she
sighed
half
to
herself
but
jimbo
could
not
follow
this
sort
of
conversation
for
long
he
was
too
anxious
to
try
his
wings
for
one
thing
is
it
difficult
to
use
them
he
asked
try
she
said
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
and
raised
them
again
and
again
they
swept
up
easily
meeting
over
his
head
and
the
air
whistled
musically
through
them
evidently
they
had
their
proper
muscles
for
it
was
no
great
effort
and
when
he
folded
them
again
by
his
side
they
fell
into
natural
curves
over
his
arms
as
if
they
had
been
there
all
his
life
the
sound
of
the
feathers
threshing
the
air
filled
him
with
delight
and
made
him
think
of
the
big
that
had
flown
past
the
window
during
the
night
he
told
the
governess
about
it
and
she
burst
out
laughing
i
was
that
big
bird
she
said
you
i
perched
on
the
roof
every
night
to
watch
over
you
i
flew
down
that
time
because
i
was
afraid
you
were
trying
to
climb
out
of
the
window
this
was
indeed
a
proof
of
devotion
and
jimbo
felt
that
he
could
never
doubt
her
again
and
when
she
went
on
to
tell
him
about
his
wings
and
how
to
use
them
he
listened
with
his
very
best
attention
and
tried
hard
to
learn
and
understand
the
great
difficulty
is
that
you
ca
practise
properly
she
explained
there
no
room
in
here
and
yet
you
ca
get
out
till
you
out
it
the
first
swoop
that
decides
all
you
have
to
drop
straight
out
of
this
window
and
if
you
use
the
wings
properly
they
will
carry
you
in
a
single
swoop
over
the
wall
and
right
up
into
the
sky
but
if
i
miss
you
ca
miss
she
said
with
decision
but
if
you
did
you
would
be
a
prisoner
here
for
ever
he
would
catch
you
in
the
yard
and
tear
your
wings
off
it
is
just
as
well
that
you
should
know
this
at
once
jimbo
shuddered
as
he
heard
her
when
can
we
try
he
asked
anxiously
very
soon
now
the
muscles
must
harden
first
and
that
takes
a
little
time
you
must
practise
flapping
your
wings
until
you
can
do
it
easily
four
hundred
times
a
minute
when
you
can
do
that
it
will
be
time
for
the
first
start
you
must
keep
your
head
steady
and
not
get
giddy
the
novelty
of
the
motion
the
ground
rushing
up
into
your
face
and
the
whistling
of
the
wind
are
apt
to
confuse
at
first
but
it
soon
passes
and
you
must
have
confidence
i
can
only
help
you
up
to
a
certain
point
the
rest
depends
on
you
and
the
first
jump
you
have
to
make
that
by
yourself
she
said
but
you
do
it
all
right
you
very
light
and
wo
go
too
near
the
ground
you
see
we
like
bats
and
can
not
rise
from
the
earth
we
can
only
fly
by
dropping
from
a
height
and
that
what
makes
the
first
plunge
rather
trying
but
you
wo
fall
she
added
and
remember
i
shall
always
be
within
reach
you
awfully
kind
to
me
said
jimbo
feeling
his
little
soul
more
than
ever
invaded
by
the
force
of
her
unselfish
care
i
promise
you
i
do
my
best
he
climbed
on
to
her
knee
and
stared
into
her
anxious
face
then
you
are
beginning
to
love
me
a
little
are
you
she
asked
softly
putting
her
arms
round
him
yes
he
said
decidedly
i
love
you
very
much
already
four
hundred
times
a
minute
sounded
a
very
great
deal
of
but
jimbo
practised
eagerly
and
though
at
first
he
could
only
manage
about
twice
a
second
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
times
a
minute
he
found
this
increased
very
soon
to
a
great
deal
more
and
before
long
he
was
able
to
do
the
full
four
hundred
though
only
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
he
stuck
to
it
pluckily
getting
stronger
every
day
the
governess
encouraged
him
as
much
as
possible
but
there
was
very
little
room
for
her
while
he
was
at
work
and
he
found
the
best
way
to
practise
was
at
night
when
she
was
out
of
the
way
she
told
him
that
a
large
bird
moved
its
wings
about
four
times
a
second
two
and
two
but
a
small
bird
like
a
partridge
moved
its
wings
so
rapidly
it
was
impossible
for
the
eye
to
distinguish
or
count
the
strokes
a
middle
course
of
four
hundred
suited
his
own
case
best
and
he
bent
all
his
energies
to
acquire
it
he
also
learned
that
the
convex
outside
curve
of
wings
allowed
the
wind
to
escape
over
them
while
the
under
side
being
concave
held
every
breath
thus
the
upward
stroke
did
not
simply
counterbalance
the
downward
and
keep
him
stationary
moreover
she
showed
him
how
the
feathers
underlapped
each
other
so
that
the
downward
stroke
pressed
them
closely
together
to
hold
the
wind
whereas
in
the
upward
stroke
they
opened
and
separated
letting
the
air
slip
easily
through
them
thus
offering
less
resistance
to
the
atmosphere
by
the
end
of
a
week
jimbo
had
practised
so
hard
that
he
could
keep
himself
off
the
floor
in
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
and
even
then
without
feeling
any
great
fatigue
his
excitement
became
intense
and
meanwhile
in
his
body
on
the
nursery
bed
though
he
did
not
know
it
the
fever
was
reaching
its
crisis
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
joys
of
flying
and
what
the
first
awful
plunge
would
be
like
and
when
miss
lake
came
up
to
him
one
afternoon
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
he
was
so
wildly
happy
that
he
hugged
her
for
several
minutes
without
the
slightest
coaxing
it
bright
and
clear
she
explained
and
fright
will
not
come
after
us
for
he
fears
the
light
and
can
only
fly
on
dark
and
gloomy
nights
so
we
can
start
he
stammered
joyfully
she
answered
for
our
first
chapter
x
the
plunge
to
enter
the
world
of
wings
is
to
enter
a
new
state
of
existence
the
apparent
loss
of
weight
the
ability
to
attain
full
speed
in
a
few
seconds
and
to
stop
suddenly
in
a
headlong
rush
without
fear
of
collapse
the
power
to
steer
instantly
in
any
direction
by
merely
changing
the
angle
of
the
body
the
altered
and
enormous
view
of
the
green
world
below
looking
down
upon
forests
seas
and
clouds
the
easy
voluptuous
rhythm
of
rising
and
falling
in
long
swinging
undulations
and
a
hundred
other
things
that
simply
defy
description
and
can
be
appreciated
only
by
actual
experience
these
are
some
of
the
delights
of
the
new
world
of
wings
and
flying
and
the
fearful
joy
of
very
high
speed
especially
when
the
exhilaration
of
escape
is
added
to
it
means
a
condition
little
short
of
real
ecstasy
yet
jimbo
first
flight
the
governess
had
been
careful
to
tell
him
could
not
be
the
flight
of
final
escape
for
even
if
the
wings
proved
equal
to
a
prolonged
effort
escape
was
impossible
until
there
was
somewhere
safe
to
escape
to
so
it
was
understood
that
the
practice
flights
might
be
long
or
might
be
short
the
important
thing
meanwhile
was
to
learn
to
fly
as
well
as
possible
for
skilled
flying
is
very
different
to
mere
headlong
rushing
and
both
courage
and
perseverance
are
necessary
to
acquire
it
with
rare
common
sense
miss
lake
had
said
very
little
about
the
possibility
of
failure
having
warned
him
about
the
importance
of
not
falling
she
had
then
stopped
and
the
power
of
suggestion
had
been
allowed
to
work
only
in
the
right
direction
of
certain
success
while
the
boy
knew
that
the
first
plunge
from
the
window
would
be
a
moment
fraught
with
the
highest
danger
his
mind
only
recognised
the
mere
of
falling
and
being
caught
he
felt
confidence
in
himself
and
by
so
much
therefore
were
the
chances
of
disaster
lessened
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
jimbo
saw
nothing
of
his
faithful
companion
he
spent
the
time
practising
and
resting
and
when
weary
of
everything
else
he
went
to
the
window
and
indulged
in
thrilling
calculations
about
the
exact
height
from
the
ground
a
drop
of
three
storeys
into
a
paved
courtyard
with
a
monster
waiting
to
catch
him
and
a
high
wall
too
close
to
allow
a
proper
swing
was
an
alarming
matter
from
any
point
of
view
fortunately
his
mind
dwelt
more
on
the
delight
of
prospective
flight
and
freedom
than
on
the
chances
of
being
caught
the
yard
lay
hot
and
naked
in
the
afternoon
glare
and
the
enclosing
wall
had
never
looked
more
formidable
but
from
his
lofty
perch
jimbo
could
see
beyond
into
soft
hayfields
and
smiling
meadows
yellow
with
cowslips
and
buttercups
everything
that
flew
he
watched
with
absorbing
interest
swift
blackbirds
whistling
as
they
went
and
crows
their
wings
purple
in
the
sunshine
the
song
of
the
larks
invisible
in
the
sea
of
blue
air
sent
a
thrill
of
happiness
through
him
he
too
might
soon
know
something
of
that
glad
music
and
even
the
stately
flight
of
the
butterflies
which
occasionally
ventured
over
into
the
yard
stirred
anticipations
in
him
of
joys
to
come
the
day
waned
slowly
the
butterflies
vanished
the
rooks
sailed
homewards
through
the
sunset
the
wind
dropped
away
and
the
shadows
of
the
high
elms
lengthened
gradually
and
fell
across
the
window
the
mysterious
hour
of
the
dusk
when
the
standard
of
reality
changes
and
other
worlds
come
close
and
listen
began
to
work
its
subtle
spell
upon
his
soul
imperceptibly
the
shadows
deepened
as
the
veil
of
night
drew
silently
across
the
sky
a
gentle
breathing
filled
the
air
trees
and
fields
were
composing
themselves
to
sleep
stars
were
peeping
wings
were
being
folded
but
the
boy
wings
trembling
with
life
to
the
very
tips
of
their
long
feathers
these
were
not
being
folded
charged
with
excitement
like
himself
they
were
gathering
all
their
forces
for
the
supreme
effort
of
their
first
journey
out
into
the
open
spaces
where
they
might
touch
the
secret
sources
of
their
own
magical
life
for
a
long
long
time
he
waited
but
at
last
the
lifted
and
miss
lake
appeared
above
the
floor
the
moment
she
stood
in
the
room
he
noticed
that
her
wings
came
through
two
little
slits
in
her
gown
and
folded
down
close
to
the
body
they
almost
touched
the
ground
hush
she
whispered
holding
up
a
warning
finger
she
came
over
on
tiptoe
and
they
began
to
talk
in
low
whispers
he
on
the
watch
we
must
speak
very
quietly
we
could
have
a
better
night
for
it
the
wind
in
the
south
and
the
moon
wo
be
up
till
we
well
on
our
way
now
that
the
actual
moment
was
so
near
the
boy
felt
something
of
fear
steal
over
him
the
night
seemed
so
vast
and
terrible
all
of
a
sudden
like
an
immense
black
ocean
with
no
friendly
islands
where
they
could
fold
their
wings
and
rest
do
waste
your
strength
thinking
whispered
the
governess
when
the
time
comes
act
quickly
that
all
she
went
over
to
the
window
and
peered
out
cautiously
after
a
while
beckoning
the
child
to
join
her
he
is
there
she
murmured
in
his
ear
jimbo
could
only
make
out
an
indistinct
shadowy
object
crouching
under
the
wall
and
he
was
not
even
positive
of
that
does
he
know
we
going
he
asked
in
an
awed
whisper
he
there
on
the
chance
she
muttered
drawing
back
into
the
room
when
there
a
possibility
of
any
one
getting
frightened
he
bound
to
be
lurking
about
somewhere
near
that
fright
all
over
but
he
hurt
you
she
added
because
you
not
going
to
get
frightened
besides
he
can
only
fly
when
it
dark
and
we
shall
have
the
moon
i
not
afraid
declared
the
boy
in
spite
of
a
rather
fluttering
heart
are
you
ready
was
all
she
said
at
last
then
the
moment
had
come
it
was
actually
beside
him
waiting
full
of
mystery
and
wonder
with
alarm
not
far
behind
the
sun
was
buried
below
the
horizon
of
the
world
and
the
dusk
had
deepened
into
night
stars
were
shining
overhead
the
leaves
were
motionless
not
a
breath
stirred
the
earth
was
silent
and
waiting
yes
i
ready
he
whispered
almost
inaudibly
then
listen
she
said
and
i
tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
jump
upwards
from
the
window
ledge
as
high
as
you
can
and
the
moment
you
begin
to
drop
open
your
wings
and
strike
with
all
your
might
rise
at
once
the
thing
to
remember
is
to
as
quickly
as
because
the
wall
prevents
a
long
easy
sweeping
rise
and
whatever
happens
you
must
clear
that
wall
i
sha
touch
the
ground
then
asked
a
faint
little
voice
of
course
not
you
get
near
it
but
the
moment
you
use
your
wings
you
stop
sinking
and
rise
up
up
up
ever
so
quickly
and
where
to
to
me
you
see
me
waiting
for
you
above
the
trees
steering
will
come
naturally
it
quite
easy
jimbo
was
already
shaking
with
excitement
he
could
not
help
it
and
he
knew
in
spite
of
all
miss
lake
care
that
fright
was
waiting
in
the
yard
to
catch
him
if
he
fell
or
sank
too
near
the
ground
i
go
first
added
the
governess
and
the
moment
you
see
that
cleared
the
wall
you
must
jump
after
me
only
do
not
keep
me
waiting
the
girl
stood
for
a
minute
in
silence
arranging
her
wings
her
fingers
were
trembling
a
little
suddenly
she
drew
the
boy
to
her
and
kissed
him
passionately
be
brave
she
whispered
looking
searchingly
into
his
eyes
and
strike
hard
you
ca
possibly
fail
in
another
minute
she
was
climbing
out
of
the
window
for
one
second
he
saw
her
standing
on
the
narrow
ledge
with
black
space
at
her
feet
the
next
without
even
a
cry
she
sprang
out
into
the
darkness
and
was
gone
jimbo
caught
his
breath
and
ran
up
to
see
she
dropped
like
a
stone
turning
over
sideways
in
the
air
and
then
at
once
her
wings
opened
on
both
sides
and
she
righted
the
darkness
swallowed
her
up
for
a
moment
so
that
he
could
not
see
clearly
and
only
heard
the
threshing
of
the
huge
feathers
but
it
was
easy
to
tell
from
the
sound
that
she
was
rising
then
suddenly
a
black
form
cleared
the
wall
and
rose
swiftly
in
a
magnificent
sweep
into
the
sky
and
he
saw
her
outlined
darkly
against
the
stars
above
the
high
elm
tree
she
was
safe
now
it
was
his
turn
act
quickly
do
think
rang
in
his
ears
if
only
he
could
do
it
all
as
quickly
as
she
had
done
it
but
insidious
fear
had
been
working
all
the
time
below
the
surface
and
his
refusal
to
recognise
it
could
not
prevent
it
weakening
his
muscles
and
checking
his
power
of
decision
fortunately
something
of
his
older
self
came
to
the
rescue
the
emotions
of
fear
excitement
and
intense
anticipation
combined
to
call
up
the
powers
of
his
deeper
being
the
boy
trembled
horribly
but
the
old
experienced
part
of
him
sang
with
joy
cautiously
he
began
to
climb
out
on
to
the
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
hung
over
the
edge
he
sat
there
staring
down
into
black
space
beneath
for
a
minute
he
hesitated
despair
rushed
over
him
in
a
wave
he
could
never
take
that
awful
jump
into
emptiness
and
darkness
it
was
impossible
better
be
a
prisoner
for
ever
than
risk
so
fearful
a
plunge
he
felt
cold
weak
frightened
and
made
a
back
into
the
room
the
wings
caught
somehow
between
his
legs
and
nearly
flung
him
headlong
into
the
yard
jimbo
i
waiting
for
you
came
at
that
moment
in
a
faint
cry
from
the
stars
and
the
sound
gave
him
just
the
impetus
he
needed
before
it
was
too
late
he
could
not
disappoint
her
his
faithful
friend
such
a
thing
was
impossible
he
stood
upright
on
the
ledge
his
hands
clutching
the
behind
balancing
as
best
he
could
he
clenched
his
fists
drew
a
deep
long
breath
and
jumped
upwards
and
forwards
into
the
air
up
rushed
the
darkness
with
a
shriek
the
air
whistled
in
his
ears
he
dropped
at
fearful
speed
into
nothingness
at
first
everything
was
forgotten
wings
instructions
warnings
and
all
he
even
forgot
to
open
his
wings
at
all
and
in
another
second
he
would
have
been
dashed
upon
the
hard
of
the
courtyard
where
his
great
enemy
lay
waiting
to
seize
him
but
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
remembered
and
the
long
hours
of
practice
bore
fruit
out
flew
the
great
red
wings
in
a
tremendous
sweep
on
both
sides
of
him
and
he
began
to
strike
with
every
atom
of
strength
he
possessed
he
had
dropped
to
within
six
feet
of
the
ground
but
at
once
the
strokes
began
to
tell
and
oh
magical
sensation
he
felt
himself
rising
easily
lightly
swiftly
a
very
slight
effort
of
those
big
wings
would
have
been
sufficient
to
lift
him
out
of
danger
but
in
his
terror
and
excitement
he
quite
miscalculated
their
power
and
in
a
single
moment
he
was
far
out
of
reach
of
the
dangerous
yard
and
anything
it
contained
but
the
mad
rush
of
it
all
made
his
head
swim
he
felt
dizzy
and
confused
and
instead
of
clearing
the
wall
he
landed
on
the
top
of
it
and
clung
to
the
crumbling
coping
with
hands
and
feet
panting
and
breathless
the
dizziness
was
only
momentary
however
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
on
his
feet
and
in
the
act
of
taking
his
second
leap
into
space
this
time
it
came
more
easily
he
dropped
and
the
field
swung
up
to
meet
him
soon
the
powerful
strokes
of
his
wings
drove
him
at
great
speed
upwards
and
he
bounded
ever
higher
towards
the
stars
overhead
the
governess
hovered
like
an
immense
bird
and
as
he
rose
up
he
caught
the
sound
of
her
wings
beating
the
air
while
far
beneath
him
he
heard
with
a
shudder
a
voice
like
the
rushing
of
a
great
river
it
made
him
increase
his
pace
and
in
another
minute
he
found
himself
among
the
little
whirlwinds
that
raced
about
from
the
beating
of
miss
great
wings
well
done
cried
the
delighted
governess
safe
at
last
now
we
can
fly
to
our
heart
content
jimbo
flew
up
alongside
and
together
they
dashed
forward
into
the
night
chapter
xi
the
first
flight
there
was
not
much
talking
at
first
the
stress
of
conflicting
emotions
was
so
fierce
that
the
words
choked
themselves
in
his
throat
and
the
desire
for
utterance
found
its
only
vent
in
hard
breathing
the
intoxication
of
rapid
motion
carried
him
away
headlong
in
more
senses
than
one
at
first
he
felt
as
if
he
never
would
be
able
to
keep
up
then
it
seemed
as
if
he
never
would
get
down
again
for
with
wings
it
is
almost
easier
to
rise
than
to
fall
and
a
first
flight
is
before
anything
else
a
series
of
vivid
and
audacious
surprises
for
a
long
time
jimbo
was
so
dizzy
with
excitement
and
the
novelty
of
the
sensation
that
he
forgot
his
deliverer
altogether
and
what
a
flight
it
was
instead
of
the
steady
race
of
the
carrier
pigeon
or
of
the
rooks
homeward
bound
at
evening
it
was
the
motion
of
the
wren
swinging
journey
across
the
lawn
only
heavier
faster
and
with
more
terrific
impetus
up
and
down
each
time
with
a
rise
and
fall
of
twenty
feet
he
careered
whistling
through
the
summer
night
at
the
drop
of
each
curve
so
low
that
the
scents
of
dewy
grass
rose
into
his
face
at
the
crest
of
it
so
high
that
the
trees
and
hedges
often
became
mere
blots
upon
the
dark
surface
of
the
earth
the
fields
rushed
by
beneath
him
the
white
roads
flashed
past
like
streaks
of
snow
sometimes
he
shot
across
sheets
of
water
and
felt
the
cooler
air
strike
his
cheeks
sometimes
over
sheltered
meadows
where
the
sunshine
had
slept
all
day
and
the
air
was
still
soft
and
warm
on
and
on
as
easily
as
rain
dropping
from
the
sky
or
wind
rushing
earthwards
from
between
the
clouds
everything
flew
past
him
at
an
astonishing
rate
everything
but
the
bright
stars
that
gazed
calmly
down
overhead
and
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
their
steadfastness
it
helped
to
keep
within
bounds
the
fine
alarm
of
this
first
excursion
into
the
great
vault
of
the
sky
gently
child
gasped
miss
lake
behind
him
we
shall
never
keep
it
up
at
this
rate
oh
but
it
so
wonderful
he
cried
drawing
in
the
air
loudly
between
his
teeth
and
shaking
his
wings
rapidly
like
a
hawk
before
it
drops
the
pace
slackened
a
little
and
the
girl
drew
up
alongside
for
some
time
they
flew
forward
together
in
silence
they
had
been
skirting
the
edge
of
a
wood
when
suddenly
the
trees
fell
away
and
jimbo
gave
a
scream
and
rose
fifty
feet
into
the
air
with
a
single
bound
straight
in
front
of
him
loomed
an
immense
glaring
disc
that
seemed
to
swim
suddenly
up
into
the
sky
above
the
trees
it
hung
there
before
his
eyes
and
dazzled
him
it
only
the
moon
cried
miss
lake
from
below
jimbo
dropped
through
the
air
to
her
side
again
with
a
gasp
i
thought
it
was
a
big
hole
in
the
sky
with
fire
rushing
through
he
explained
breathlessly
the
boy
stared
full
of
wonder
and
delight
at
the
huge
flaming
circle
that
seemed
to
fill
half
the
heavens
in
front
of
him
look
out
cried
the
governess
seizing
his
hand
whish
whew
whirr
a
large
bird
whipped
past
them
like
some
winged
imp
of
darkness
vanishing
among
the
trees
far
below
there
would
certainly
have
been
a
collision
but
for
the
girl
energetic
interference
you
must
be
on
the
for
these
she
said
they
fly
so
unexpectedly
and
of
course
they
do
see
us
properly
telegraph
wires
and
church
steeples
are
bad
too
but
then
we
sha
fly
over
cities
much
keep
a
good
height
it
safer
they
altered
their
course
a
little
flying
at
a
different
angle
so
that
the
moon
no
longer
dazzled
them
steering
came
quite
easily
by
turning
the
body
and
jimbo
still
led
the
way
the
governess
following
heavily
and
with
a
mighty
business
of
wings
and
flapping
it
was
something
to
remember
the
glory
of
that
first
journey
through
the
air
sixty
miles
an
hour
and
scarcely
an
effort
skimming
the
long
ridges
of
the
hills
and
rushing
through
the
pure
air
of
mountain
tops
threading
the
bathing
themselves
from
head
to
foot
in
an
ocean
of
cool
clean
wind
swimming
on
the
waves
of
viewless
currents
currents
warmed
only
by
the
magic
of
the
stars
and
kissed
by
the
burning
lips
of
flying
meteors
far
below
them
the
moonlight
touched
the
fields
with
silver
and
the
murmur
of
the
world
rose
faintly
to
their
ears
trembling
as
it
were
with
the
inarticulate
dreams
of
millions
everywhere
about
them
thrilled
and
sang
the
unspeakable
power
of
the
night
the
mystery
of
its
great
heart
seemed
laid
bare
before
them
it
was
like
a
in
some
eastern
fairy
tale
sometimes
they
passed
through
zones
of
sweeter
air
perfumed
with
the
scents
of
hay
and
wild
flowers
at
others
the
fresh
damp
odour
of
ploughed
fields
rose
up
to
them
or
again
they
went
spinning
over
leagues
of
forest
where
the
stretched
beneath
them
like
the
surface
of
a
wide
green
sea
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
and
when
they
crossed
open
water
the
stars
shone
reflected
in
their
faces
and
all
the
while
the
wings
whirring
and
purring
softly
through
the
darkness
made
pleasant
music
in
their
ears
i
tired
declared
jimbo
presently
then
we
go
down
and
rest
said
his
breathless
companion
with
obvious
relief
she
showed
him
how
to
spread
his
wings
sloping
them
towards
the
ground
at
an
angle
that
enabled
him
to
shoot
rapidly
downwards
at
the
same
time
regulating
his
speed
by
the
least
upward
tilt
it
was
a
glorious
motion
without
effort
or
difficulty
though
the
pace
made
it
hard
to
keep
the
eyes
open
and
breathing
became
almost
impossible
they
dropped
to
within
ten
feet
of
the
ground
and
then
shot
forward
again
but
while
the
boy
was
watching
his
companion
movements
and
paying
too
little
attention
to
his
own
there
rose
suddenly
before
him
out
of
the
ground
a
huge
bulky
form
of
something
and
crash
he
flew
headlong
into
it
fortunately
it
was
only
a
haystack
but
the
speed
at
which
he
was
going
lodged
his
head
several
inches
under
the
thatch
whence
he
projected
horizontally
into
space
feet
arms
and
wings
gyrating
furiously
the
governess
however
soon
released
him
with
much
laughter
and
they
dropped
down
into
the
fallen
hay
upon
the
ground
with
no
worse
result
than
a
shaking
oh
what
a
lark
he
cried
shaking
the
hay
out
of
his
feathers
and
rubbing
his
head
rather
ruefully
except
that
larks
are
hardly
she
laughed
helping
him
they
settled
with
folded
wings
in
the
shadow
of
the
haystack
and
the
big
moon
peeping
over
the
edge
at
them
must
have
surely
wondered
to
see
such
a
funny
couple
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
an
hour
mushrooms
suddenly
cried
the
governess
springing
to
her
feet
there
must
be
lots
in
this
field
i
go
and
pick
some
while
you
rest
a
bit
off
she
went
trapesing
over
the
field
in
the
moonlight
her
wings
folded
behind
her
her
body
bent
a
little
forward
as
she
searched
and
in
ten
minutes
she
came
back
with
her
hands
full
that
was
undoubtedly
the
time
to
enjoy
mushrooms
at
their
best
with
the
dew
still
on
their
tight
little
jackets
and
the
sweet
odour
of
the
earth
caught
under
their
umbrellas
soon
they
were
all
eaten
and
jimbo
was
lying
back
on
a
pile
of
hay
his
shoulders
against
the
wall
of
the
stack
and
his
wings
gathered
round
him
like
a
warm
cloak
of
feathers
he
felt
cosy
and
dozy
full
of
mushrooms
inside
and
covered
with
hay
and
feathers
outside
the
governess
had
once
told
him
that
a
sort
of
sleep
sometimes
came
after
a
long
flight
it
was
of
course
not
a
real
sleep
but
a
state
in
which
everything
about
oneself
is
forgotten
no
dreams
no
movement
no
falling
asleep
and
waking
up
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
a
condition
of
deep
repose
in
which
recuperation
is
very
great
jimbo
would
have
been
greatly
interested
no
doubt
to
know
that
his
real
body
on
the
bed
had
also
just
been
receiving
nourishment
and
was
now
passing
into
a
quieter
and
less
feverish
condition
the
parallel
always
held
true
between
himself
and
his
body
in
the
nursery
but
he
could
not
know
anything
about
this
and
only
supposed
that
it
was
this
sleep
that
he
felt
gently
stealing
over
him
it
brought
at
first
strange
thoughts
that
carried
him
far
away
to
other
woods
and
other
fields
while
miss
lake
sat
beside
him
eating
her
mushrooms
his
mind
was
drawn
off
to
some
other
little
folk
but
it
was
always
stopped
just
short
of
them
he
never
could
quite
see
their
faces
yet
his
thoughts
continued
their
search
groping
in
the
darkness
he
felt
sure
he
ought
to
be
sharing
his
adventures
with
these
other
little
persons
whoever
they
were
they
ought
to
have
been
sitting
beside
him
at
that
very
moment
eating
mushrooms
combing
their
wings
comparing
the
length
of
their
feathers
and
snuggling
with
him
into
the
warm
hay
but
they
obstinately
hovered
just
outside
his
memory
and
refused
to
come
in
and
surrender
themselves
he
could
not
remember
who
they
were
and
his
yearnings
went
unsatisfied
up
to
the
stars
as
yearnings
generally
do
while
his
thoughts
returned
weary
from
their
search
and
he
yielded
to
the
seductions
of
the
soothing
sleep
the
moon
meanwhile
rose
higher
and
higher
drawing
a
silver
veil
over
the
stars
upon
the
field
the
dews
of
midnight
fell
silently
a
faint
mist
rose
from
the
ground
and
covered
the
flowers
in
their
dim
seclusion
under
the
hedgerows
the
hours
slipped
away
swiftly
come
on
jimbo
boy
cried
the
governess
at
length
the
moon
below
the
hills
and
we
must
be
off
the
boy
turned
and
stared
sleepily
at
her
from
his
nest
in
the
hay
we
got
miles
to
go
remember
the
speed
we
came
at
she
explained
getting
up
and
arranging
her
wings
jimbo
got
up
slowly
and
shook
himself
i
been
miles
away
he
said
dreamily
miles
and
miles
but
ready
to
start
at
once
they
looked
about
for
a
raised
place
to
jump
from
a
ladder
stood
against
the
other
side
of
the
haystack
the
governess
climbed
up
it
and
jimbo
followed
her
drowsily
hand
in
hand
they
sprang
into
the
air
from
the
edge
of
the
thatched
roof
and
their
wings
spread
out
like
sails
to
catch
the
wind
it
smote
their
faces
pleasantly
as
they
plunged
downwards
and
forwards
and
the
exhilarating
rush
of
cool
air
banished
from
the
boy
head
the
last
vestige
of
the
sleep
we
must
keep
up
a
good
pace
cried
the
governess
taking
a
stream
and
the
hedge
beyond
in
a
single
sweep
there
a
light
in
the
east
already
as
she
spoke
a
dog
howled
in
a
farmyard
beneath
them
and
she
shot
upwards
as
though
lifted
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
we
too
low
she
shouted
from
above
that
dog
felt
us
near
come
up
higher
it
easier
flying
and
we
got
a
long
way
to
go
jimbo
followed
her
up
till
they
were
several
hundred
feet
above
the
earth
and
the
keen
air
stung
their
cheeks
then
she
led
him
still
higher
till
the
meadows
looked
like
the
squares
on
a
and
the
trees
were
like
little
toy
shrubs
here
they
rushed
along
at
a
tremendous
speed
too
fast
to
speak
their
wings
churning
the
air
into
little
whirlwinds
and
eddies
as
they
passed
whizzing
whistling
tearing
through
space
the
fields
however
were
still
dim
in
the
shadows
that
precede
the
dawn
and
the
stars
only
just
beginning
to
fade
when
they
saw
the
dark
outline
of
the
empty
house
below
them
and
began
carefully
to
descend
soon
they
topped
the
high
elms
startling
the
rooks
into
noisy
cawing
and
then
skimming
the
wall
sailed
stealthily
on
outspread
wings
across
the
yard
cautiously
dropping
down
to
the
level
of
the
window
they
crawled
over
the
sill
into
the
dark
little
room
and
folded
their
wings
chapter
xii
the
four
winds
the
governess
left
the
boy
to
his
own
reflections
almost
immediately
he
spent
the
hours
thinking
and
resting
going
over
again
in
his
mind
every
incident
of
the
great
flight
and
wondering
when
the
real
final
escape
would
come
and
what
it
would
be
like
thus
between
the
two
states
of
excitement
he
forgot
for
a
while
that
he
was
still
a
prisoner
and
the
spell
of
horror
was
lifted
temporarily
from
his
heart
the
day
passed
quickly
and
when
miss
lake
appeared
in
the
evening
she
announced
that
there
could
be
no
flying
again
that
night
and
that
she
wished
instead
to
give
him
important
instruction
for
the
future
there
were
rules
and
signs
and
times
which
he
must
learn
carefully
the
time
might
come
when
he
would
have
to
fly
alone
and
he
must
be
prepared
for
everything
and
the
first
thing
i
have
to
tell
you
she
said
exactly
as
though
it
was
a
schoolroom
is
fly
over
the
our
kind
of
wings
quickly
absorb
the
finer
particles
of
water
and
get
clogged
and
heavy
over
the
sea
you
finally
can
not
resist
the
drawing
power
of
the
water
and
you
will
be
dragged
down
and
drowned
so
be
very
careful
when
you
are
flying
high
it
is
often
difficult
to
know
where
the
land
ends
and
the
sea
begins
especially
on
moonless
nights
but
you
can
always
be
certain
of
one
thing
if
there
are
no
sounds
below
you
hoofs
voices
wheels
wind
in
trees
you
are
over
the
sea
yes
said
the
child
listening
with
great
attention
and
what
else
the
next
thing
is
fly
too
though
we
fly
like
birds
remember
we
are
not
birds
and
we
can
fly
where
they
ca
we
can
fly
in
the
ether
where
that
he
interrupted
half
afraid
of
the
sound
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
laughing
at
his
fear
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
she
explained
the
air
gets
lighter
and
lighter
as
you
go
higher
till
at
last
it
stops
altogether
then
there
only
ether
left
birds
ca
fly
in
ether
because
it
too
thin
we
can
because
is
that
why
it
was
good
for
me
to
get
lighter
and
thinner
he
interrupted
again
in
a
puzzled
voice
partly
yes
and
what
happens
in
the
ether
please
it
still
frightened
him
a
little
nothing
except
that
if
you
fly
too
high
you
reach
a
point
where
the
earth
ceases
to
hold
you
and
you
dash
off
into
space
weight
leaves
you
then
and
the
wings
move
without
effort
faster
and
faster
you
rush
upwards
till
you
lose
all
control
of
your
movements
and
then
miss
lake
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
asked
the
fascinated
child
you
may
never
come
down
again
she
said
slowly
you
may
be
sucked
into
anything
that
happens
to
come
your
way
a
comet
or
a
shooting
star
or
the
moon
i
should
like
a
shooting
star
best
observed
the
boy
deeply
interested
the
moon
frightens
me
i
think
it
looks
so
dreadfully
clean
you
wo
like
any
of
them
when
the
time
comes
she
laughed
no
one
ever
gets
out
again
who
once
gets
in
but
you
never
be
caught
that
way
after
what
i
told
you
she
added
with
decision
i
shall
never
want
to
fly
as
high
as
that
i
sure
said
jimbo
and
now
please
what
comes
next
the
next
thing
she
went
on
to
explain
was
the
which
to
all
flying
creatures
was
of
the
utmost
importance
before
starting
for
a
flight
he
must
always
carefully
consider
the
state
of
the
sky
and
the
direction
in
which
he
wished
to
go
for
this
purpose
he
must
master
the
meaning
and
character
of
the
four
winds
and
be
able
to
recognise
them
in
a
moment
once
you
know
these
she
said
you
can
not
possibly
go
wrong
to
make
it
easier
i
put
each
wind
into
a
little
simple
rhyme
for
you
i
listening
he
said
eagerly
the
north
wind
is
one
of
the
worst
and
most
dangerous
because
it
blows
so
much
faster
than
you
think
it
taken
you
ten
miles
before
you
think
you
gone
two
in
starting
with
a
north
wind
always
fly
it
then
it
will
bring
you
home
easily
if
you
fly
it
you
may
be
swept
so
far
that
the
day
will
catch
you
before
you
can
get
home
and
then
you
as
good
as
lost
even
birds
fly
warily
when
this
wind
is
about
it
has
no
lulls
or
in
it
it
blows
steadily
on
and
on
and
conquers
everything
it
comes
against
everything
except
the
mountains
and
its
rhyme
asked
jimbo
all
ears
it
will
show
you
the
joy
of
the
birds
my
child
you
shall
know
their
terrible
bliss
it
will
teach
you
to
hide
when
the
night
is
wild
from
the
storm
too
passionate
kiss
for
the
wind
of
the
north
is
a
volleying
forth
that
will
lift
you
with
springs
in
the
heart
of
your
wings
and
may
sweep
you
away
to
the
edge
of
the
day
so
beware
of
the
wind
of
the
north
my
child
fly
not
with
the
wind
of
the
north
i
think
i
like
him
all
the
same
said
jimbo
but
i
remember
always
to
fly
against
him
the
east
wind
is
worse
still
for
it
hurts
continued
the
governess
it
stings
and
cuts
it
like
the
breath
of
an
it
brings
hail
and
sleet
and
cold
rain
that
beat
down
wings
and
blind
the
eyes
like
the
north
wind
too
it
is
dreadfully
swift
and
full
of
little
whirlwinds
and
may
easily
carry
you
into
the
light
of
day
that
would
prove
your
destruction
avoid
it
always
no
is
safe
from
it
this
is
the
rhyme
it
will
teach
you
the
secrets
the
eagles
know
of
the
tempests
and
whirlwinds
birth
and
the
magical
weaving
of
rain
and
snow
as
they
fall
from
the
sky
to
the
earth
but
an
easterly
wind
is
for
ever
unkind
it
will
torture
and
twist
you
and
never
assist
you
but
will
drive
you
with
might
to
the
verge
of
the
night
so
beware
of
the
wind
of
the
east
my
child
fly
not
with
the
wind
of
the
east
the
west
wind
is
really
a
very
nice
and
jolly
wind
in
itself
she
went
on
but
it
dangerous
for
a
special
reason
will
carry
you
out
to
the
empty
house
is
only
a
few
miles
from
the
coast
and
a
strong
west
wind
would
take
you
there
almost
before
you
had
time
to
get
down
to
earth
again
and
there
no
use
struggling
against
a
really
steady
west
wind
for
it
simply
tireless
luckily
it
rarely
blows
at
night
but
goes
down
with
the
sun
often
too
it
blows
hard
to
the
coast
and
then
drops
suddenly
leaving
you
among
the
fogs
and
mists
of
the
sea
rather
a
nice
exciting
sort
of
wind
though
remarked
jimbo
waiting
for
the
rhyme
so
at
last
you
shall
know
from
their
lightest
breath
to
which
heaven
each
wind
belongs
and
shall
master
their
meaning
for
life
or
death
by
the
shout
of
their
splendid
songs
yet
the
wind
of
the
west
is
a
wind
unblest
it
is
lifted
and
kissed
by
the
spirits
of
mist
it
will
clasp
you
and
flee
to
the
wastes
of
the
sea
so
beware
of
the
wind
of
the
west
my
child
fly
not
with
the
wind
of
the
west
a
jolly
wind
observed
jimbo
again
but
that
does
leave
much
over
to
fly
with
he
added
sadly
they
all
seem
dangerous
or
cruel
yes
she
laughed
and
so
they
are
till
you
can
master
them
then
they
kind
only
one
that
really
always
safe
and
kind
is
the
wind
of
the
south
it
a
sweet
gentle
wind
beloved
of
all
that
flies
and
you
ca
possibly
mistake
it
you
can
tell
it
at
once
by
the
murmuring
way
it
stirs
the
grasses
and
the
tops
of
the
trees
its
taste
is
soft
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
like
wine
and
there
always
a
faint
perfume
about
it
like
gardens
in
summer
it
is
the
joy
of
this
wind
that
makes
all
flying
things
sing
with
a
south
wind
you
can
go
anywhere
and
no
harm
can
come
to
you
dear
old
south
wind
cried
jimbo
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
i
hope
it
will
blow
soon
its
rhyme
is
very
easy
too
though
you
will
always
be
able
to
tell
it
without
that
she
added
for
this
is
the
favourite
wind
of
all
beloved
of
the
stars
and
night
in
the
rustle
of
leaves
you
shall
hear
it
call
to
the
passionate
joys
of
flight
it
will
carry
you
forth
in
its
wonderful
hair
to
the
courts
of
the
sky
and
the
breath
of
its
lips
is
a
murmuring
prayer
for
the
safety
of
all
who
fly
for
the
wind
of
the
south
is
like
wine
in
the
mouth
with
its
whispering
showers
and
perfume
of
flowers
when
it
falls
like
a
sigh
from
the
heart
of
the
sky
oh
interrupted
jimbo
rubbing
his
hands
that
nice
that
wind
it
will
bear
you
aloft
with
a
pressure
so
soft
that
you
hardly
shall
guess
whose
the
gentle
caress
hooray
he
cried
again
it
the
kindest
of
weathers
for
our
red
feathers
and
blows
open
the
way
to
the
gardens
of
play
so
fly
out
with
the
wind
of
the
south
my
child
with
the
wonderful
wind
of
the
south
oh
i
love
the
south
wind
already
he
shouted
clapping
his
hands
again
i
hope
it
will
blow
very
soon
it
may
be
rising
even
now
answered
the
governess
leading
him
to
the
window
but
as
they
gazed
at
the
summer
landscape
lying
in
the
fading
light
of
the
sunset
all
was
still
and
resting
the
air
was
hushed
the
leaves
motionless
there
was
no
call
just
then
to
flight
from
among
the
and
he
went
back
into
the
room
disappointed
but
why
ca
we
escape
at
once
he
asked
again
after
he
had
given
his
promise
to
remember
all
she
had
told
him
and
to
be
extra
careful
if
he
ever
went
out
flying
alone
jimbo
dear
i
told
you
before
it
because
your
body
is
ready
for
you
yet
she
answered
patiently
there
hardly
any
circulation
in
it
and
if
you
forced
your
way
back
now
the
shock
might
stop
your
heart
beating
altogether
then
you
be
really
dead
and
escape
would
be
impossible
the
boy
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
staring
intently
at
her
while
she
spoke
something
clutched
at
his
heart
he
felt
his
older
self
with
its
greater
knowledge
rising
up
out
of
the
depths
within
him
the
child
struggled
with
the
old
soul
for
possession
have
got
any
circulation
he
asked
abruptly
at
length
i
mean
has
heart
stopped
beating
but
the
smile
called
up
by
his
words
froze
on
her
lips
she
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
back
to
the
fading
light
avoiding
his
eyes
my
case
jimbo
is
a
little
different
from
yours
she
said
presently
the
important
thing
is
to
make
certain
about
your
escape
never
mind
about
me
but
escape
without
you
is
nothing
he
said
the
older
self
now
wholly
in
possession
i
simply
would
go
i
rather
stay
here
with
you
the
governess
made
no
reply
but
she
turned
her
back
to
the
room
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
jimbo
fancied
he
heard
a
sob
he
felt
a
great
big
heart
swelling
up
within
his
little
body
and
he
crossed
over
beside
her
for
some
minutes
they
stood
there
in
silence
watching
the
stars
that
were
already
shining
faintly
in
the
sky
whatever
happens
he
said
nestling
against
her
i
sha
go
from
here
without
you
remember
that
he
was
going
to
say
a
lot
more
but
somehow
or
other
when
she
stooped
over
to
kiss
his
head
he
hardly
came
up
to
her
shoulder
it
all
ran
suddenly
out
of
his
mind
and
the
little
child
dropped
back
into
possession
again
the
tide
of
his
thoughts
that
seemed
about
to
rise
fast
and
furious
sank
away
completely
leaving
his
mind
a
slate
without
a
single
image
and
presently
without
any
more
words
the
governess
left
him
and
went
through
the
into
the
silence
and
mystery
of
the
house
below
several
hours
later
about
the
middle
of
the
night
there
came
over
him
a
most
disagreeable
sensation
of
nausea
and
dizziness
the
ground
rose
and
fell
beneath
his
feet
the
walls
swam
about
sideways
and
the
ceiling
slid
off
into
the
air
it
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
however
and
jimbo
knew
from
what
she
had
told
him
that
it
was
the
flying
sickness
which
always
followed
the
first
long
flight
but
about
the
same
time
another
little
body
lying
in
a
bed
was
being
convulsed
with
a
similar
attack
and
the
sickness
of
the
little
prisoner
in
the
empty
house
had
its
parallel
strangely
enough
in
the
body
miles
away
in
a
different
world
chapter
xiii
pleasures
of
flight
since
the
night
when
jimbo
had
nearly
fallen
into
the
yard
and
risked
capture
fright
the
horrible
owner
of
the
house
had
kept
himself
well
out
of
the
way
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
neither
seen
nor
heard
but
the
boy
was
not
foolish
enough
to
fall
into
the
other
trap
and
imagine
therefore
that
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
jimbo
felt
quite
sure
that
he
was
only
waiting
his
chance
and
the
avoidance
of
the
subject
tended
to
confirm
this
supposition
he
disappeared
somewhere
and
taken
the
children
with
him
she
declared
when
he
questioned
her
and
now
you
know
almost
as
much
as
i
do
but
not
quite
he
laughed
mischievously
enough
though
she
replied
we
want
all
our
energy
for
escape
when
it
comes
do
bother
about
anything
else
for
the
moment
during
the
day
when
he
was
alone
his
thoughts
and
fancies
often
terrified
him
but
at
night
when
he
was
rushing
through
the
heavens
the
intense
delight
of
flying
drove
all
minor
emotions
out
of
his
consciousness
and
he
even
forgot
his
one
great
desire
to
escape
one
night
however
something
happened
that
brought
it
back
more
keenly
than
ever
he
had
been
out
flying
alone
but
had
not
gone
far
when
he
noticed
that
an
easterly
wind
had
begun
to
rise
and
was
blowing
steadily
behind
him
with
the
recent
instructions
fresh
in
his
head
he
thought
it
wiser
to
turn
homewards
rather
than
fight
his
way
back
later
against
a
really
strong
wind
from
this
quarter
flying
low
along
the
surface
of
the
fields
so
as
to
avoid
its
full
force
he
suddenly
rose
up
with
a
good
sweep
and
settled
on
the
top
of
the
wall
enclosing
the
yard
the
moonlight
lay
bright
over
everything
his
approach
had
been
very
quiet
he
was
just
about
to
sail
across
to
the
window
when
something
caught
his
eye
and
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
stared
something
was
moving
at
the
other
end
of
the
courtyard
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
moonlight
suddenly
grew
pale
and
ghastly
the
night
air
turned
chilly
shivers
began
to
run
up
and
down
his
back
he
folded
his
wings
and
watched
at
the
end
of
the
yard
he
saw
several
figures
moving
busily
to
and
fro
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
they
were
very
small
but
close
beside
them
all
the
time
stood
a
much
larger
figure
which
seemed
to
be
directing
their
movements
there
was
no
need
to
look
twice
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
these
terrible
little
people
and
their
hideous
overseer
horror
rushed
over
the
boy
and
a
wild
scream
was
out
in
the
night
before
he
could
possibly
prevent
it
at
the
same
moment
a
cloud
passed
over
the
face
of
the
moon
and
the
yard
was
shrouded
in
darkness
a
minute
later
the
cloud
passed
off
but
while
it
was
still
too
dark
to
see
clearly
jimbo
was
conscious
of
a
rushing
whispering
sound
in
the
air
and
something
went
past
him
at
a
tremendous
pace
into
the
sky
the
wind
stirred
his
hair
as
it
passed
and
a
moment
later
he
heard
voices
far
away
in
the
distance
up
in
the
sky
or
within
the
house
he
could
not
tell
singing
mournfully
the
song
he
now
knew
so
well
we
dance
with
phantoms
and
with
shadows
play
but
when
he
looked
down
at
the
yard
he
saw
that
it
was
deserted
and
the
corner
by
the
little
upright
stones
lay
in
the
clear
moonlight
empty
of
figures
large
or
small
shivering
with
fright
he
flew
across
to
the
window
ledge
and
almost
tumbled
into
the
arms
of
the
governess
who
was
standing
close
inside
what
the
matter
child
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
and
still
shuddering
he
told
her
how
he
thought
he
had
seen
the
children
working
by
the
gravestones
all
her
efforts
to
calm
him
at
first
failed
but
after
a
bit
she
drew
his
thoughts
to
pleasanter
things
and
he
was
not
so
certain
after
all
that
he
had
not
been
deceived
by
the
cunning
of
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
a
long
interval
passed
and
no
further
sign
was
given
by
the
owner
of
the
house
or
his
band
of
frightened
children
jimbo
soon
lost
himself
again
in
the
delights
of
flying
and
the
joy
of
his
increasing
powers
most
of
all
he
enjoyed
the
quiet
starlit
nights
before
the
moon
was
up
for
the
moon
dazzled
the
eyes
in
the
rarefied
air
where
they
flew
whereas
the
stars
gave
just
enough
light
to
steer
by
without
making
it
uncomfortable
moreover
the
moon
often
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
faint
terror
as
of
death
he
could
never
gaze
at
her
white
face
for
long
without
feeling
that
something
entered
his
heart
with
those
silver
rays
something
that
boded
him
no
good
he
never
spoke
of
this
to
the
governess
indeed
he
only
recognised
it
himself
when
the
moon
was
near
the
full
but
it
lay
always
in
the
depths
of
his
being
and
he
felt
dimly
that
it
would
have
to
be
reckoned
with
before
he
could
really
escape
for
good
he
took
no
liberties
when
the
moon
was
at
the
full
he
loved
to
hover
for
he
had
learned
by
this
time
that
most
difficult
of
all
flying
feats
to
hold
the
body
vertical
and
whirr
the
wings
without
rising
or
advancing
he
loved
to
hover
on
windless
nights
over
ponds
and
rivers
and
see
the
stars
reflected
in
their
still
pools
indeed
sometimes
he
hovered
till
he
dropped
and
only
saved
himself
from
a
wetting
by
sweeping
up
in
a
tremendous
curve
along
the
surface
of
the
water
and
thus
up
into
the
branches
of
the
trees
where
the
governess
sat
waiting
for
him
and
then
after
a
little
rest
they
would
launch
forth
again
and
fly
over
fields
and
woods
sometimes
even
as
far
as
the
hills
that
ran
down
the
coast
of
the
sea
itself
they
usually
flew
at
a
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
and
the
earth
passed
beneath
them
like
a
great
streaked
shadow
but
as
soon
as
the
moon
was
up
the
whole
country
turned
into
a
fairyland
of
wonder
her
light
touched
the
woods
with
a
softened
magic
and
the
fields
and
hedges
became
frosted
most
delicately
beneath
a
thin
transparency
of
mist
the
water
shone
with
a
silvery
brilliance
that
always
enabled
them
to
distinguish
it
from
the
land
at
any
height
while
the
farms
and
country
houses
were
swathed
in
tender
grey
shadows
through
which
the
trees
and
chimneys
pierced
in
slender
lines
of
black
it
was
wonderful
to
watch
the
shadows
everywhere
spinning
their
blue
veil
of
distance
that
lent
even
to
the
commonest
objects
something
of
enchantment
and
mystery
those
were
wonderful
journeys
they
made
together
into
the
pathways
of
the
silent
night
along
the
unknown
courses
into
that
hushed
centre
where
they
could
almost
hear
the
beatings
of
her
great
heart
like
winged
thoughts
searching
the
huge
vault
till
the
boy
ached
with
the
sensations
of
speed
and
distance
and
the
old
yellow
moon
seemed
to
stagger
across
the
sky
sometimes
they
rose
very
high
into
freezing
air
so
high
that
the
earth
became
a
dull
shadow
specked
with
light
they
saw
the
trains
running
in
all
directions
with
thin
threads
of
smoke
shining
in
the
glare
of
the
open
but
they
seemed
very
tiny
trains
indeed
and
stirred
in
him
no
recollections
of
the
visits
to
london
town
when
he
went
to
the
dentist
and
lunched
with
the
dreaded
grandmother
or
the
stiff
and
fashionable
aunts
and
when
they
came
down
again
from
these
perilous
heights
the
scents
of
the
earth
rose
to
meet
them
the
perfume
of
woods
and
fields
and
the
smells
of
the
open
country
there
was
too
the
delight
the
curious
delight
of
windy
nights
when
the
wind
smote
and
buffeted
them
knocking
them
suddenly
sideways
whistling
through
their
feathers
as
if
it
wanted
to
tear
them
from
their
sockets
rushing
furiously
up
underneath
their
wings
with
repeated
blows
turning
them
round
and
backwards
and
forwards
washing
them
from
head
to
foot
in
a
tempestuous
sea
of
rapid
and
unexpected
motion
it
was
of
course
far
easier
to
fly
with
a
wind
than
without
one
the
difficulty
with
a
violent
wind
was
to
get
down
not
to
keep
up
the
gusts
drove
up
against
the
of
their
wings
and
kept
them
afloat
so
that
by
merely
spreading
them
like
sails
they
could
sweep
and
circle
without
a
single
stroke
jimbo
soon
learned
to
manoeuvre
so
that
he
could
turn
the
strength
of
a
great
wind
to
his
own
purposes
and
revel
in
its
boisterous
waves
and
currents
like
a
strong
swimmer
in
a
rough
sea
and
to
listen
to
the
wind
as
it
swept
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
below
was
another
pleasure
for
everything
it
touched
gave
out
a
definite
note
he
soon
got
to
know
the
long
sad
cry
from
the
willows
and
the
little
whispering
in
the
tops
of
the
poplar
trees
the
crisp
silvery
rattle
of
the
birches
and
the
deep
roar
from
oaks
and
beech
woods
the
sound
of
a
forest
was
like
the
shouting
of
the
sea
but
far
more
lovely
when
they
descended
a
little
and
the
wind
was
more
gentle
were
the
low
pipings
among
the
reeds
and
the
little
wayward
murmurs
under
the
hedgerows
the
pine
trees
however
drew
them
most
with
their
weird
voices
now
far
away
now
near
rising
upwards
with
a
wind
of
sighs
there
was
a
grove
of
these
trees
that
trooped
down
to
the
waters
of
a
little
lake
in
the
hills
and
to
this
spot
they
often
flew
when
the
wind
was
low
and
the
music
likely
therefore
to
be
to
their
taste
for
even
when
there
was
no
perceptible
wind
these
trees
seemed
always
full
of
mysterious
mournful
whisperings
their
branches
held
soft
music
that
never
quite
died
away
even
when
all
other
trees
were
silent
and
motionless
besides
these
special
expeditions
they
flew
everywhere
and
anywhere
they
visited
the
birds
in
their
nests
in
lofty
trees
and
exchanged
the
time
of
night
with
owls
staring
out
upon
them
from
the
ivy
they
hovered
up
the
face
of
great
cliffs
and
passed
the
hawks
asleep
on
perilous
ledges
skimmed
over
lonely
marshes
frightening
the
paddling
in
and
out
among
the
reeds
they
followed
the
windings
of
streams
singing
among
the
meadows
and
flew
along
the
wet
sands
as
they
watched
the
moon
rise
out
of
the
sea
these
flights
were
unadulterated
pleasure
and
jimbo
thought
he
could
never
have
enough
of
them
he
soon
began
to
notice
too
that
the
trees
emanated
something
that
affected
his
own
condition
when
he
sat
in
their
branches
this
was
very
noticeable
currents
of
force
passed
from
them
into
himself
and
even
when
he
flew
over
their
crests
he
was
aware
that
some
woods
exhaled
vigorous
forces
while
others
tired
and
depleted
him
nothing
was
visible
actually
but
fine
waves
seemed
to
beat
up
against
his
eyes
and
thoughts
making
him
stronger
or
weaker
happy
or
melancholy
full
of
hope
and
courage
or
listless
and
indifferent
these
emanations
of
the
trees
this
of
their
own
personal
forces
were
of
course
very
varied
in
strength
and
character
oaks
and
pines
were
the
best
combination
he
found
before
the
stress
of
a
long
flight
the
former
giving
him
steadiness
and
the
latter
steely
endurance
and
the
power
to
steer
in
sinuous
swift
curves
without
taking
thought
or
trouble
other
trees
gave
other
powers
all
gave
something
it
was
impossible
to
sit
among
their
branches
without
absorbing
some
of
the
subtle
and
exhilarating
he
soon
learned
how
to
gather
it
all
into
himself
and
turn
it
to
account
in
his
own
being
sit
quietly
the
governess
said
let
the
forces
creep
in
and
stir
about
do
nothing
yourself
give
them
time
to
become
part
of
yourself
and
mix
properly
with
your
own
currents
effort
on
your
part
prevents
this
and
you
weaken
them
without
gaining
anything
yourself
jimbo
made
all
sorts
of
experiments
with
trees
and
rocks
and
water
and
fields
learning
gradually
the
different
qualities
of
force
they
gave
forth
and
how
to
use
them
for
himself
nothing
he
found
was
really
dead
and
sometimes
he
got
himself
into
strange
difficulties
in
the
beginning
of
his
attempts
to
master
and
absorb
these
remember
the
governess
warned
him
more
than
once
when
he
was
inclined
to
play
tricks
they
are
in
quite
a
different
world
to
ours
you
can
not
take
liberties
with
them
even
a
sympathetic
soul
like
yourself
only
touches
the
fringe
of
their
world
you
exchange
with
them
nothing
more
some
trees
have
terrible
forces
just
below
the
surface
they
could
extinguish
you
altogether
absorb
you
into
themselves
others
are
naturally
hostile
some
are
mere
tricksters
others
are
shifty
and
treacherous
like
the
hollies
that
move
about
too
much
the
oak
and
the
pine
and
the
elm
are
friendly
and
you
can
always
trust
them
absolutely
but
there
are
others
she
held
up
a
warning
finger
and
jimbo
eyes
nearly
dropped
out
of
his
head
no
she
added
in
reply
to
his
questions
you
ca
learn
all
this
at
once
perhaps
she
hesitated
a
little
perhaps
if
you
escape
we
should
have
time
for
all
manner
of
adventures
among
the
trees
and
other
things
but
then
we
going
to
escape
so
there
no
good
wasting
time
over
chapter
xiv
an
adventure
but
miss
lake
did
not
always
accompany
him
on
these
excursions
into
the
night
sometimes
he
took
long
flights
by
himself
and
she
rather
encouraged
him
in
this
saying
it
would
give
him
confidence
in
case
he
ever
lost
her
and
was
obliged
to
find
his
way
about
alone
but
i
could
get
really
lost
he
said
once
to
her
i
know
the
winds
perfectly
now
and
the
country
round
for
miles
and
i
never
go
out
in
fog
but
these
are
only
practice
flights
she
replied
the
flight
of
escape
is
a
very
different
matter
i
want
you
to
learn
all
you
possibly
can
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
anything
jimbo
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
when
she
talked
like
this
but
you
be
with
me
in
the
escape
flight
the
final
one
of
all
he
said
and
nothing
ever
goes
wrong
when
you
with
me
i
should
like
to
be
always
with
you
she
answered
tenderly
but
well
to
be
prepared
for
anything
just
the
same
and
more
than
this
the
boy
could
never
get
out
of
her
on
one
of
these
lonely
flights
however
he
made
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
he
was
being
followed
at
first
he
only
imagined
there
was
somebody
after
him
because
of
the
curious
vibrations
of
the
very
rarefied
air
in
which
he
flew
every
time
his
flight
slackened
and
the
noise
of
his
own
wings
grew
less
there
reached
him
from
some
other
corner
of
the
sky
a
sound
like
the
vibrations
of
large
wings
beating
the
air
it
seemed
behind
and
generally
below
him
but
the
swishing
of
his
own
feathers
made
it
difficult
to
hear
with
distinctness
or
to
be
certain
of
the
direction
evidently
it
was
a
long
way
off
but
now
and
again
when
he
took
a
spurt
and
then
sailed
silently
for
several
minutes
on
outstretched
wings
the
beating
of
distant
following
feathers
seemed
unmistakably
clear
and
he
raced
on
again
at
full
speed
more
than
terrified
other
times
however
when
he
tried
to
listen
there
was
no
trace
of
this
other
flyer
and
then
his
fear
would
disappear
and
he
would
persuade
himself
that
it
had
been
imagination
so
much
on
these
flights
he
knew
to
be
imagination
the
sentences
voices
and
laughter
for
instance
that
filled
the
air
and
sounded
so
real
yet
were
actually
caused
by
the
wind
rushing
past
his
ears
the
rhythm
of
the
and
the
tips
of
the
feathers
occasionally
rubbing
against
the
sides
of
his
body
but
at
last
one
night
the
suspicion
that
he
was
followed
became
a
certainty
he
was
flying
far
up
in
the
sky
passing
over
some
big
city
when
the
sound
rose
to
his
ears
and
he
paused
sailing
on
stretched
wings
to
listen
looking
down
into
the
immense
space
below
he
saw
plainly
outlined
against
the
luminous
patch
above
the
city
the
form
of
a
large
flying
creature
moving
by
with
rapid
strokes
the
pulsations
of
its
great
wings
made
the
air
tremble
so
that
he
both
heard
and
felt
them
it
may
have
been
that
the
vapours
of
the
city
distorted
the
thing
just
as
the
earth
atmosphere
magnifies
the
rising
or
setting
of
the
moon
but
even
so
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
something
a
good
deal
larger
than
himself
and
with
a
much
more
powerful
flight
fortunately
it
did
not
seem
this
time
to
be
actually
on
his
trail
for
it
swept
by
at
a
great
pace
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
darkness
far
ahead
perhaps
it
was
only
searching
for
him
and
his
great
height
had
proved
his
safety
but
in
any
case
he
was
exceedingly
terrified
and
at
once
turned
round
pointed
his
head
for
the
earth
and
shot
downwards
in
the
direction
of
the
empty
house
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
but
when
he
spoke
to
the
governess
she
made
light
of
it
and
told
him
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
it
might
have
been
a
flock
of
hurrying
she
said
or
an
owl
distorted
by
the
city
light
or
even
his
own
reflection
magnified
in
water
anyhow
she
felt
sure
it
was
not
chasing
him
and
he
need
pay
no
attention
to
it
jimbo
felt
reassured
but
not
quite
satisfied
he
knew
a
flying
monster
when
he
saw
one
and
it
was
only
when
he
had
been
for
many
more
flights
alone
without
its
reappearance
that
his
confidence
was
fully
restored
and
he
began
to
forget
about
it
certainly
these
lonely
flights
were
very
much
to
his
taste
his
older
self
with
its
dim
hauntings
of
a
great
memory
somewhere
behind
him
took
possession
then
and
he
was
able
to
commune
with
nature
in
a
way
that
the
presence
of
the
governess
made
impossible
with
her
his
older
self
rarely
showed
itself
above
the
surface
for
long
he
was
always
the
child
but
when
alone
nature
became
alive
he
drew
force
from
the
trees
and
flowers
and
felt
that
they
all
shared
a
common
life
together
had
he
been
imprisoned
by
some
wizard
of
old
in
a
knowing
of
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
only
by
the
sweet
messages
that
rustled
in
his
branches
the
wind
could
hardly
have
spoken
to
him
with
a
more
intimate
meaning
or
the
life
of
the
fields
eternally
patient
have
touched
him
more
nearly
with
their
joys
and
sorrows
it
seemed
almost
as
if
from
his
leafy
cell
he
had
gazed
before
this
into
the
shining
pools
with
which
the
summer
rains
jewelled
the
meadows
sending
his
soul
in
a
stream
of
unsatisfied
yearning
up
to
the
stars
it
all
came
back
dimly
when
he
heard
the
wind
among
the
leaves
and
carried
him
off
to
the
woods
and
fields
of
an
existence
far
antedating
this
one
and
on
gentle
nights
when
the
wind
itself
was
half
asleep
and
dreaming
the
pine
trees
drew
him
most
of
all
for
theirs
was
the
song
he
loved
above
all
others
he
would
fly
round
and
round
the
little
grove
by
the
mountain
lake
listening
for
hours
together
to
their
sighing
voices
but
the
governess
was
never
told
of
this
whatever
she
may
have
guessed
for
it
seemed
to
him
a
joy
too
deep
for
words
the
pains
and
sweetness
being
mingled
too
mysteriously
for
him
ever
to
express
in
awkward
sentences
moreover
it
all
passed
away
and
was
forgotten
the
moment
the
child
took
possession
and
usurped
the
older
memory
one
night
when
the
moon
was
high
and
the
air
was
cool
and
fragrant
after
the
heat
of
the
day
jimbo
felt
a
strong
desire
to
get
off
by
himself
for
a
long
flight
he
was
full
of
energy
and
the
cried
to
be
satisfied
for
several
days
he
had
been
content
with
slow
stupid
expeditions
with
the
governess
i
off
alone
he
cried
balancing
on
the
window
ledge
but
i
be
back
before
dawn
she
kissed
him
as
she
always
did
now
and
with
her
ringing
in
his
ears
he
dropped
from
the
window
and
rose
rapidly
over
the
elms
and
away
from
earth
this
night
for
some
reason
the
stars
and
the
moon
seemed
to
draw
him
and
with
tireless
wings
he
mounted
up
up
up
to
a
height
he
had
never
reached
before
the
intoxication
of
the
strong
night
air
rose
into
his
brain
and
he
dashed
forward
ever
faster
with
a
mad
delight
into
the
endless
space
before
him
mile
upon
mile
lay
behind
him
as
he
rushed
onwards
always
pointing
a
little
on
the
upward
slope
drunk
with
speed
the
earth
faded
away
to
a
dark
expanse
of
shadow
beneath
him
and
he
no
longer
was
conscious
of
the
deep
murmur
that
usually
flowed
steadily
upwards
from
its
surface
he
had
often
before
risen
out
of
reach
of
the
earth
noises
but
never
so
far
that
this
dull
reverberating
sound
combined
of
all
the
voices
of
the
world
merged
together
failed
to
make
itself
heard
however
he
heard
nothing
the
stars
above
his
head
changed
from
yellow
to
diamond
white
and
the
cold
air
stung
his
cheeks
and
brought
the
water
to
his
eyes
but
at
length
the
governess
warning
as
he
explored
these
forbidden
regions
came
back
to
him
and
in
a
series
of
gigantic
bounds
that
took
his
breath
away
completely
he
dropped
nearer
to
the
earth
again
and
kept
on
at
a
much
lower
level
the
hours
passed
and
the
position
of
the
moon
began
to
alter
noticeably
some
of
the
constellations
that
were
overhead
when
he
started
were
now
dipping
below
the
horizon
never
before
had
he
ventured
so
far
from
home
and
he
began
to
realise
that
he
had
been
flying
much
longer
than
he
knew
or
intended
the
speed
had
been
terrific
the
change
came
imperceptibly
with
the
discovery
that
his
wings
were
not
moving
quite
so
easily
as
before
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
this
had
really
been
the
case
for
some
little
time
he
was
flying
with
greater
effort
and
for
a
long
time
this
effort
had
been
increasing
gradually
before
he
actually
recognised
the
fact
although
no
longer
pointing
towards
the
earth
he
seemed
to
be
sinking
it
became
increasingly
difficult
to
fly
upwards
his
wings
did
not
seem
to
fail
or
weaken
nor
was
he
conscious
of
feeling
tired
but
something
was
ever
persuading
him
to
fly
lower
almost
as
if
a
million
tiny
threads
were
coaxing
him
downwards
drawing
him
gradually
nearer
to
the
world
again
whatever
it
was
the
earth
had
come
much
closer
to
him
in
the
last
hour
and
its
familiar
voices
were
pleasant
to
hear
after
the
boundless
heights
he
had
just
left
but
for
some
reason
his
speed
grew
insensibly
less
and
less
his
wings
moved
apparently
as
fast
as
before
but
it
was
harder
to
keep
up
in
spite
of
himself
he
kept
sinking
the
sensation
was
quite
new
and
he
could
not
understand
it
it
almost
seemed
as
though
he
were
being
downwards
jimbo
began
to
feel
uneasy
he
had
not
lost
his
bearings
but
he
was
a
very
long
way
from
home
and
quite
beyond
reach
of
the
help
he
was
so
accustomed
to
with
a
great
effort
he
mounted
several
hundred
feet
into
the
air
and
tried
hard
to
stay
there
for
a
short
time
he
succeeded
but
he
soon
felt
himself
sinking
gradually
downwards
again
the
force
drawing
him
was
a
constant
force
without
rise
or
fall
and
with
a
deadly
feeling
of
fear
the
boy
began
to
realise
that
he
would
soon
have
to
yield
to
it
altogether
his
heart
beat
faster
and
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
friend
who
was
then
far
away
but
who
alone
could
save
him
she
at
least
could
have
explained
it
and
told
him
what
best
to
do
but
the
governess
was
beyond
his
reach
this
problem
he
must
face
alone
something
however
had
to
be
done
quickly
and
jimbo
acting
more
as
the
man
than
as
the
boy
turned
and
flew
hurriedly
forward
in
another
direction
he
hoped
this
might
somehow
counteract
the
force
that
still
drew
him
downwards
and
for
a
time
it
apparently
did
so
and
he
flew
level
but
the
strain
increased
every
minute
and
he
looked
down
with
something
of
a
shudder
as
he
realised
that
before
very
long
he
would
be
obliged
to
yield
to
this
deadly
force
and
drop
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
a
change
had
come
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
below
instead
of
the
patchwork
of
field
and
wood
and
road
he
saw
a
vast
cloud
stretching
out
white
and
smooth
in
the
moonlight
the
world
was
hidden
beneath
a
snowy
fog
dense
and
impenetrable
it
was
no
longer
even
possible
to
tell
in
what
direction
he
was
flying
for
there
was
nothing
to
steer
by
this
was
a
new
and
unexpected
complication
and
the
boy
could
not
understand
how
the
change
had
come
about
so
quickly
the
last
time
he
had
glanced
down
for
indications
to
steer
by
everything
had
been
clear
and
easily
visible
it
was
very
beautiful
this
carpet
of
white
mist
with
the
silver
moon
shining
upon
it
but
it
thrilled
him
now
with
an
unpleasant
sense
of
dread
and
still
more
unpleasant
was
a
new
sound
which
suddenly
broke
in
upon
the
stillness
and
turned
his
blood
into
ice
he
was
certain
that
he
heard
wings
behind
him
he
was
being
followed
and
this
meant
that
it
was
impossible
to
turn
and
fly
back
there
was
nothing
now
to
do
but
fly
forwards
and
hope
to
distance
the
huge
wings
but
if
he
was
being
followed
by
the
powerful
flyer
he
had
seen
a
few
nights
before
the
boy
knew
that
he
stood
little
chance
of
success
and
he
only
did
it
because
it
seemed
the
one
thing
possible
the
cloud
was
dense
and
chill
as
he
entered
it
its
moisture
clung
to
his
wings
and
made
them
heavy
his
muscles
seemed
to
stiffen
and
motion
became
more
and
more
difficult
the
wings
behind
him
meanwhile
came
closer
he
was
flying
along
the
surface
of
the
mist
now
his
body
and
wings
hidden
and
his
head
just
above
the
level
he
could
see
along
its
white
even
top
if
he
sank
a
few
more
inches
it
would
be
impossible
to
see
at
all
or
even
to
judge
where
he
was
going
soon
it
rose
level
with
his
lips
and
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
a
new
smell
in
the
air
faint
at
first
but
growing
every
moment
stronger
it
was
a
fresh
sweet
odour
yet
it
somehow
added
to
his
alarm
and
stirred
in
him
new
centres
of
uneasiness
he
tried
vainly
to
increase
his
speed
and
distance
the
wings
which
continued
to
gain
so
steadily
upon
him
from
behind
the
cloud
apparently
was
not
everywhere
of
the
same
density
for
here
and
there
he
saw
the
tops
of
green
hills
below
him
as
he
flew
but
he
could
not
understand
why
each
green
hill
seemed
to
have
a
little
lake
on
its
summit
a
little
lake
in
which
the
reflected
moon
stared
straight
up
into
his
face
nor
could
he
quite
make
out
what
the
sounds
were
which
rose
to
his
ears
through
the
muffling
of
the
cloud
sounds
of
tumultuous
rushing
hissing
and
tumbling
they
were
continuous
these
sounds
and
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
heard
with
them
a
deep
thunderous
roar
that
almost
made
his
heart
stop
beating
as
he
listened
was
he
perhaps
over
a
range
of
high
mountains
and
was
this
the
sound
of
the
tumbling
torrents
then
suddenly
it
came
to
him
with
a
shock
that
the
ordinary
sounds
of
the
earth
had
wholly
ceased
jimbo
felt
his
head
beginning
to
whirl
he
grew
weaker
every
minute
less
able
to
offer
resistance
to
the
remorseless
forces
that
were
sucking
him
down
now
the
mist
had
closed
over
his
head
and
he
could
no
longer
see
the
moonlight
he
turned
again
shaking
with
terror
and
drove
forward
headlong
through
the
clinging
vapour
a
sensation
of
choking
rose
in
his
throat
he
was
tired
out
ready
to
drop
with
exhaustion
the
wings
of
the
following
creature
were
now
so
close
that
he
thought
every
minute
he
would
be
seized
from
behind
and
plunged
into
the
abyss
to
his
death
it
was
just
then
that
he
made
the
awful
discovery
that
the
world
below
him
was
not
stationary
the
hills
were
they
were
sweeping
past
with
a
rushing
thundering
sound
in
regular
procession
and
their
huge
sides
were
streaked
with
white
the
reflection
of
the
moon
leaped
up
into
his
face
as
each
hill
rolled
hissing
and
gurgling
by
and
he
knew
at
last
with
a
shock
of
unutterable
horror
that
it
was
the
sea
he
was
flying
over
the
sea
and
the
waters
were
drawing
him
down
the
immense
green
waves
that
rolled
along
through
the
sea
fog
carrying
the
moon
face
on
their
crests
foaming
and
gurgling
as
they
went
were
already
leaping
up
to
seize
him
by
the
feet
and
drag
him
into
their
depths
he
dropped
several
feet
deeper
into
the
mist
and
towards
the
sea
and
blinded
then
turning
frantically
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
struck
out
with
his
last
strength
for
the
upper
surface
and
the
moonlight
but
as
he
did
so
turning
his
face
towards
the
sky
he
saw
a
dark
form
hovering
just
above
him
covering
his
retreat
with
huge
outstretched
wings
it
was
too
late
he
was
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
at
that
moment
a
huge
rolling
wave
bigger
than
all
the
rest
swept
past
and
wet
him
to
the
knees
his
heart
failed
him
the
next
wave
would
cover
him
already
it
was
rushing
towards
him
with
foaming
crest
he
was
in
its
shadow
he
heard
its
thunder
darkness
rushed
over
him
he
saw
the
vast
sides
streaked
with
grey
and
white
when
suddenly
the
owner
of
the
wings
plucked
him
in
the
back
between
the
shoulders
and
lifted
him
bodily
out
of
the
fog
so
that
the
wave
swept
by
without
even
wetting
his
feet
the
next
minute
he
saw
a
dim
white
sheet
of
silvery
mist
at
his
feet
and
found
himself
far
above
it
in
the
sweet
clean
moonlight
and
when
he
turned
almost
dead
with
terror
to
look
upon
his
captor
he
found
himself
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
governess
the
sense
of
relief
was
so
great
that
jimbo
simply
closed
his
wings
and
hung
a
dead
weight
in
the
air
use
your
wings
cried
the
governess
sharply
and
still
holding
him
while
he
began
to
flap
feebly
she
turned
and
flew
in
the
direction
of
the
land
you
he
gasped
at
last
it
was
you
following
me
of
course
it
was
me
i
never
let
you
out
of
my
sight
i
always
followed
you
every
time
you
been
out
alone
jimbo
was
still
conscious
of
the
drawing
power
of
the
sea
but
he
felt
that
his
companion
was
too
strong
for
it
after
fifteen
minutes
of
fierce
flight
he
heard
the
sounds
of
earth
again
and
knew
that
they
were
safe
then
the
governess
loosened
her
hold
and
they
flew
along
side
by
side
in
the
direction
of
home
i
wo
scold
you
jimbo
she
said
presently
for
you
suffered
enough
already
she
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
but
remember
the
sea
draws
you
down
just
as
surely
as
the
moon
draws
you
up
nothing
would
please
him
better
than
to
see
you
destroyed
by
one
or
the
other
jimbo
said
nothing
but
when
once
they
were
safe
inside
the
room
again
he
went
up
and
cried
his
eyes
out
on
her
arm
while
she
folded
him
in
to
her
heart
as
if
he
were
the
only
thing
in
the
whole
world
she
had
to
love
chapter
xv
the
call
of
the
body
one
night
towards
the
end
of
the
practice
flights
a
strange
thing
happened
which
showed
that
the
time
for
the
final
flight
of
escape
was
drawing
near
they
had
been
out
for
several
hours
flying
through
a
rainstorm
the
thousand
little
drops
of
which
stung
their
faces
like
tiny
about
two
in
the
morning
the
wind
shifted
and
drove
the
clouds
away
as
by
magic
the
stars
came
out
at
first
like
the
eyes
of
children
still
dim
with
crying
but
later
with
a
clear
brilliance
that
filled
jimbo
and
the
governess
with
keen
pleasure
the
air
was
washed
and
perfumed
the
night
luminous
alive
singing
all
its
tenderness
and
passion
entered
their
hearts
and
filled
them
with
the
wonder
of
its
glory
come
down
jimbo
said
the
governess
and
we
lie
in
the
trees
and
smell
the
air
after
the
rain
yes
added
the
boy
whose
older
self
had
been
whispering
mysterious
things
to
him
and
watch
the
stars
and
hear
them
singing
he
led
the
way
to
some
beech
trees
that
lined
a
secluded
lane
and
settled
himself
comfortably
in
the
top
branches
of
the
largest
while
the
governess
soon
found
a
beside
him
it
was
a
deserted
spot
far
from
human
habitation
here
and
there
through
the
foliage
they
could
see
little
pools
of
reflecting
the
sky
the
group
of
trees
swung
in
the
wind
dreaming
great
woodland
dreams
and
overhead
the
stars
looked
like
a
thousand
orchards
in
the
sky
filling
the
air
with
the
radiance
of
their
blossoms
how
brilliant
they
are
said
the
governess
after
watching
the
boy
attentively
for
some
minutes
as
they
lay
side
by
side
in
the
great
forked
branch
i
never
saw
the
constellations
so
clear
but
they
have
so
little
shape
he
answered
dreamily
if
we
wore
lights
when
we
flew
about
we
should
make
much
better
constellations
than
they
do
the
big
and
little
child
instead
of
the
big
and
little
bear
she
laughed
still
watching
him
i
slipping
away
he
began
and
then
stopped
suddenly
he
saw
the
expression
of
his
companion
eyes
which
were
looking
him
through
and
through
with
the
most
poignant
love
and
yearning
mingled
in
their
gaze
and
something
clutched
at
his
heart
that
he
could
not
not
slipping
out
of
the
tree
he
went
on
vaguely
but
slipping
into
some
new
place
or
condition
i
do
understand
it
am
i
going
off
somewhere
where
you
ca
follow
i
thought
suddenly
i
was
losing
you
the
governess
smiled
at
him
sadly
and
said
nothing
she
stroked
his
wings
and
then
raised
them
to
her
lips
and
kissed
them
jimbo
watched
her
and
folded
his
other
wing
across
into
her
hands
he
felt
unhappy
and
his
heart
began
to
swell
within
him
but
he
did
know
what
to
say
and
the
older
self
began
slowly
to
fade
away
again
but
the
stars
he
went
on
have
they
got
things
they
send
out
too
forces
i
mean
like
the
trees
do
they
send
out
something
that
makes
us
feel
sad
or
happy
or
strong
or
weak
she
did
not
answer
for
some
time
she
lay
watching
his
face
and
fondling
his
smooth
red
wings
and
presently
when
she
did
begin
to
explain
jimbo
found
that
the
child
in
him
was
then
paramount
again
and
he
could
not
quite
follow
what
she
said
he
tried
to
answer
properly
and
seem
interested
but
her
words
were
very
long
and
hard
to
understand
and
after
a
time
he
thought
she
was
talking
to
herself
more
than
to
him
and
he
gave
up
all
serious
effort
to
follow
then
he
became
aware
that
her
voice
had
changed
the
words
seemed
to
drop
down
upon
him
from
a
great
height
he
imagined
she
was
standing
on
one
of
those
far
stars
he
had
been
asking
about
and
was
shouting
at
him
through
an
immense
tube
of
sky
and
darkness
the
words
pricked
his
ears
like
only
he
no
longer
heard
them
as
words
but
as
tiny
explosions
of
sound
meaningless
and
distant
swift
flashes
of
light
began
to
dance
before
his
eyes
and
suddenly
from
underneath
the
tree
a
wind
rose
up
and
rushed
laughing
across
his
face
darkness
in
a
mass
dropped
over
his
eyes
and
he
sank
backwards
somewhere
into
another
corner
of
space
altogether
the
governess
meanwhile
lay
quite
still
watching
the
limp
form
in
the
branches
beside
her
and
still
holding
the
tips
of
his
red
wings
presently
tears
stole
into
her
eyes
and
began
to
run
down
her
cheeks
one
deep
sigh
after
another
escaped
from
her
lips
but
the
little
boy
or
the
old
soul
who
was
the
cause
of
all
her
emotion
apparently
was
far
away
and
knew
nothing
of
it
for
a
long
time
she
lay
in
silence
and
then
leaned
a
little
nearer
to
him
so
as
to
see
his
full
face
the
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
but
they
were
looking
at
nothing
she
could
see
for
the
consciousness
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
and
jimbo
just
then
was
off
on
a
little
journey
of
his
own
a
journey
that
was
but
preliminary
to
the
great
final
one
of
all
jimbo
whispered
the
girl
between
her
tears
and
sighs
jimbo
where
have
you
gone
to
tell
me
are
they
getting
ready
for
you
at
last
and
am
i
to
lose
you
after
all
is
this
the
only
way
i
can
save
you
by
losing
you
there
was
no
answer
no
sign
of
movement
and
the
governess
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
quietly
to
herself
while
her
tears
dropped
down
through
the
branches
of
the
tree
and
fell
into
the
beneath
for
jimbo
state
of
oblivion
in
the
tree
was
in
reality
a
momentary
return
to
consciousness
in
his
body
on
the
bed
and
the
repaired
mechanism
of
the
brain
and
muscles
had
summoned
him
back
on
a
sort
of
trial
visit
he
remembered
nothing
of
it
afterwards
any
more
than
one
remembers
the
experiences
of
deep
sleep
but
the
fact
was
that
with
the
descent
of
the
darkness
upon
him
in
the
branches
he
had
opened
his
eyes
once
again
on
the
scene
in
the
bedroom
where
his
body
lay
he
saw
figures
standing
round
the
bed
and
about
the
room
his
mother
with
the
same
white
face
as
before
was
still
bending
over
the
bed
asking
him
if
he
knew
her
a
tall
man
in
a
long
black
coat
moved
noiselessly
to
and
fro
and
he
saw
a
shaded
lamp
on
a
table
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
bed
nothing
seemed
to
have
changed
very
much
though
there
had
probably
been
time
enough
since
he
last
opened
his
eyes
for
the
doctor
to
have
gone
and
come
again
for
a
second
visit
he
held
an
instrument
in
his
hands
that
shone
brightly
in
the
lamplight
jimbo
saw
this
plainly
and
wondered
what
it
was
he
felt
as
if
he
were
just
waking
out
of
a
nice
deep
sleep
dreamless
and
undisturbed
the
empty
house
the
governess
fright
and
the
children
had
all
vanished
from
his
memory
and
he
knew
no
more
about
wings
and
feathers
than
he
did
about
the
science
of
meteorology
but
the
bedroom
scene
was
a
mere
glimpse
after
all
his
eyes
were
already
beginning
to
close
again
first
they
shut
out
the
figure
of
the
doctor
then
the
and
then
the
nurse
moved
her
arm
making
the
whole
scene
quiver
for
an
instant
like
some
huge
before
it
dipped
into
profound
darkness
and
disappeared
altogether
his
mother
voice
ran
off
into
a
thin
trickle
of
sound
miles
and
miles
away
and
the
light
from
the
lamp
followed
him
with
its
glare
for
less
than
half
a
second
all
had
vanished
jimbo
dear
where
have
you
been
can
you
remember
anything
asked
the
soft
voice
beside
him
as
he
looked
first
at
the
stars
overhead
and
then
from
the
tracery
of
branches
and
leaves
beneath
him
to
the
great
sea
of
and
open
country
all
round
but
he
could
tell
her
nothing
he
seemed
dreamy
and
lying
and
staring
at
her
as
if
he
hardly
knew
who
she
was
or
what
she
was
saying
his
mind
was
still
hovering
near
the
of
the
two
states
of
consciousness
like
the
region
between
sleeping
and
waking
where
both
worlds
seem
unreal
and
wholly
wonderful
he
could
not
answer
her
questions
but
he
evidently
caught
some
reflex
of
her
emotions
for
he
leaned
towards
her
across
the
branches
and
said
he
was
happy
and
never
wanted
to
leave
her
then
he
crawled
to
the
end
of
the
big
bough
and
sprang
out
into
the
air
with
a
shout
of
delight
he
was
the
child
again
the
flying
child
wild
with
the
excitement
of
tearing
through
the
night
air
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
the
governess
soon
followed
him
and
they
flew
home
together
taking
a
long
turn
by
the
sea
and
past
the
great
chalk
cliffs
where
the
sea
sang
loud
beneath
them
these
lapses
became
with
time
more
frequent
as
well
as
of
longer
duration
and
with
them
the
boy
noticed
that
the
longing
to
escape
became
once
again
intense
he
wanted
get
wherever
home
was
he
experienced
a
sort
of
nostalgia
for
the
body
though
he
could
not
remember
where
that
body
lay
but
when
he
asked
the
governess
what
this
feeling
meant
she
only
mystified
him
by
her
answers
saying
that
every
one
in
the
body
or
out
of
it
felt
a
deep
longing
for
their
final
though
they
might
not
have
the
least
idea
where
it
lay
or
even
to
be
able
to
recognise
much
less
to
label
their
longing
his
normal
feelings
too
were
slowly
returning
to
him
the
older
self
became
more
and
more
submerged
as
he
approached
the
state
of
ordinary
superficial
consciousness
the
characteristics
of
that
state
reflected
themselves
more
and
more
in
his
thoughts
and
feelings
his
memory
still
remained
a
complete
blank
but
he
somehow
felt
that
the
things
places
and
people
he
wanted
to
remember
had
moved
much
nearer
to
him
than
before
every
day
brought
them
more
within
his
reach
all
these
forgotten
things
will
come
back
to
me
soon
i
know
he
said
one
day
to
the
governess
and
then
i
tell
you
all
about
them
perhaps
you
remember
me
too
then
she
answered
a
shadow
passing
across
her
face
jimbo
clapped
his
hands
with
delight
oh
he
cried
i
should
like
to
remember
you
because
that
would
make
you
a
sort
of
governess
and
i
should
love
you
twice
as
much
but
with
the
gradual
return
to
former
conditions
the
feelings
of
age
and
experience
grew
dim
and
indefinite
his
knowledge
lessened
becoming
obscure
and
confused
showing
itself
only
in
vague
impressions
and
impulses
until
at
last
it
became
quite
the
exception
for
the
to
be
broken
through
by
flashes
of
intuition
and
inspiration
from
the
more
deeply
hidden
memories
for
one
thing
the
deep
horror
of
the
empty
house
and
its
owner
now
returned
to
him
with
full
force
fear
settled
down
again
over
the
room
and
lurked
in
the
shadows
over
the
yard
a
vivid
dread
seized
him
of
the
in
the
room
the
door
through
which
the
frightened
children
had
disappeared
but
which
had
never
opened
since
it
gradually
became
for
him
a
personality
in
the
room
a
staring
silent
listening
thing
always
watching
always
waiting
one
day
it
would
open
and
he
would
be
caught
in
a
dozen
ways
like
this
the
horror
of
the
house
entered
his
heart
and
made
him
long
for
escape
with
all
the
force
of
his
being
but
the
governess
too
seemed
changing
she
was
becoming
more
vague
and
more
mysterious
her
face
was
always
sad
now
and
her
eyes
wistful
her
manner
became
restless
and
uneasy
and
in
many
little
ways
the
child
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
her
mind
was
intent
upon
other
things
he
begged
her
to
name
the
day
for
the
final
flight
but
she
always
seemed
to
have
some
good
excuse
for
putting
it
off
i
feel
frightened
when
you
do
tell
me
what
going
on
he
said
to
her
it
the
preparations
for
the
last
flight
she
answered
the
flight
of
escape
he
try
to
prevent
us
going
together
so
that
you
should
get
lost
but
it
better
you
should
know
too
much
she
added
trust
me
and
have
patience
oh
that
what
you
so
afraid
of
he
said
he
was
very
proud
indeed
of
the
long
word
and
said
it
over
several
times
to
himself
and
the
governess
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
fading
sunlight
repeated
to
herself
more
than
to
him
the
word
he
was
so
proud
of
yes
that
what
i
so
afraid
of
separation
but
if
it
means
your
salvation
and
her
sentence
remained
unfinished
as
her
eyes
wandered
far
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
into
the
shadows
of
the
sky
and
jimbo
drawn
by
the
sadness
of
her
voice
turned
towards
the
window
and
noticed
to
his
utter
amazement
that
he
could
right
through
he
could
see
the
branches
of
the
trees
her
body
but
the
next
instant
she
turned
and
was
no
longer
transparent
and
before
the
boy
could
say
a
word
she
crossed
the
floor
and
disappeared
from
the
room
chapter
xvi
preparation
now
that
he
was
preparing
to
leave
it
jimbo
began
to
realise
more
fully
how
things
in
this
world
of
delirium
so
the
governess
sometimes
called
it
were
all
terribly
out
of
order
and
confused
so
long
as
he
was
wholly
in
it
and
of
it
everything
had
seemed
all
right
but
as
he
approached
his
normal
condition
again
the
disorder
became
more
and
more
apparent
and
the
next
few
hours
brought
it
home
with
startling
clearness
and
increased
to
fever
heat
the
desire
for
final
escape
it
was
not
so
much
a
it
was
too
alarming
for
that
as
a
world
of
nightmare
wherein
everything
was
distorted
events
in
it
were
all
out
of
proportion
effects
no
longer
sprang
from
adequate
causes
things
happened
in
a
dislocated
sort
of
way
and
there
was
no
sequence
in
the
order
of
their
happening
tiny
occurrences
filled
him
with
disproportionate
inconceivable
horror
and
great
events
on
the
other
hand
passed
him
scathless
the
spirit
of
disorder
monstrous
uncouth
terrifying
reigned
supreme
and
jimbo
whole
desire
though
inarticulate
was
to
escape
back
into
order
and
harmony
again
in
contrast
to
all
this
dreadful
uncertainty
the
conduct
of
the
governess
stood
out
alone
as
the
one
thing
he
could
count
upon
she
was
sure
and
unfailing
he
felt
absolute
confidence
in
her
plans
for
his
safety
and
when
he
thought
of
her
his
mind
was
at
rest
come
what
might
she
would
always
be
there
in
time
to
help
the
adventure
over
the
sea
had
proved
that
but
childlike
he
thought
chiefly
of
his
own
safety
and
had
ceased
to
care
very
much
whether
she
escaped
with
him
or
not
it
was
the
older
jimbo
that
preferred
captivity
to
escape
without
her
whereas
every
minute
now
he
was
sinking
deeper
into
the
normal
child
state
in
which
the
intuitive
flashes
from
the
buried
soul
became
more
and
more
rare
meanwhile
there
was
preparation
going
on
secret
and
mysterious
he
could
feel
it
some
one
else
besides
the
governess
was
making
plans
and
the
boy
began
to
dread
the
moment
of
escape
almost
as
much
as
he
desired
it
the
alternative
appalled
him
to
live
for
ever
in
the
horror
of
this
house
bounded
by
the
narrow
yard
watched
by
fright
listening
ever
at
his
elbow
and
visited
by
the
horrible
frightened
children
even
the
governess
herself
began
to
inspire
him
with
something
akin
to
fear
as
her
personality
grew
more
and
more
mysterious
he
thought
of
her
as
she
stood
by
the
window
with
the
branches
of
the
tree
visible
through
her
body
and
the
thought
filled
him
with
a
dreadful
and
haunting
distress
but
this
was
only
when
she
was
absent
the
moment
she
came
into
the
room
and
he
looked
into
her
kind
eyes
the
old
feeling
of
security
returned
and
he
felt
safe
and
happy
once
during
the
day
she
came
up
to
see
him
and
this
time
with
final
instructions
jimbo
listened
with
rapt
attention
or
night
we
start
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
you
must
wait
till
you
hear
me
calling
but
we
start
together
he
interrupted
not
exactly
she
replied
i
doing
everything
possible
to
put
him
off
the
scent
but
it
not
easy
for
once
fright
knows
you
he
always
on
the
watch
even
if
he
ca
prevent
your
escape
he
try
to
send
you
home
to
your
body
with
such
a
shock
that
you
be
only
for
the
rest
of
your
life
jimbo
did
not
quite
understand
what
she
meant
by
this
and
returned
at
once
to
the
main
point
then
the
moment
you
call
i
to
start
yes
i
shall
be
outside
somewhere
it
depends
on
the
wind
and
weather
a
little
but
probably
i
shall
be
hovering
above
the
trees
you
must
dash
out
of
the
window
and
join
me
the
moment
you
hear
me
call
clear
the
wall
without
sinking
into
the
yard
and
mind
he
does
tear
your
wings
off
as
you
fly
by
what
will
happen
though
if
i
do
find
you
he
asked
you
might
get
lost
if
he
succeeds
in
getting
me
out
of
the
way
first
you
sure
to
get
lost
but
i
had
long
flights
without
getting
lost
he
objected
nothing
to
this
one
she
replied
it
will
be
tremendous
you
see
jimbo
it
not
only
distance
it
change
of
condition
as
well
i
do
mind
what
it
is
so
long
as
we
escape
together
he
said
puzzled
by
her
words
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
it
seemed
to
him
she
was
changing
even
as
he
looked
at
her
a
sort
of
veil
lifted
from
her
features
he
fancied
he
could
see
the
shape
of
the
door
through
her
body
oh
please
miss
lake
he
began
in
a
frightened
voice
taking
a
step
towards
her
what
is
the
matter
you
look
so
different
nothing
dearest
boy
is
the
matter
she
replied
faintly
i
feel
sad
at
the
thought
of
your
of
our
going
that
all
but
that
nothing
she
added
more
briskly
and
remember
i
told
you
exactly
what
to
do
so
you
ca
make
any
mistake
now
for
the
present
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
that
he
had
never
seen
there
before
and
an
expression
of
tenderness
and
love
that
he
could
not
fail
to
understand
but
even
as
he
looked
she
seemed
to
fade
away
into
a
delicate
thin
shadow
as
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
jimbo
stretched
out
his
arms
to
touch
her
for
the
moment
of
dread
had
passed
and
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
no
she
cried
sharply
do
touch
me
child
do
touch
me
but
he
was
already
close
beside
her
and
in
another
second
would
have
had
his
arms
round
her
when
his
foot
stumbled
over
something
and
he
fell
forward
into
her
with
his
full
weight
instead
of
saving
himself
against
her
body
however
he
fell
through
nothing
stopped
him
there
was
no
resistance
he
met
nothing
more
solid
than
air
and
fell
full
length
upon
the
floor
before
he
could
recover
from
his
surprise
and
pick
himself
up
something
touched
him
on
the
lips
and
he
heard
a
voice
that
was
faint
as
a
whisper
saying
darling
child
and
bless
you
the
next
moment
he
was
on
his
feet
again
and
the
room
was
empty
the
governess
had
gone
through
the
and
he
was
alone
it
was
all
very
strange
and
confusing
and
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
her
he
never
for
a
moment
realised
that
the
change
was
in
himself
and
that
as
the
tie
between
himself
and
his
body
became
closer
the
things
of
this
other
world
he
had
been
living
in
for
so
long
must
fade
gradually
away
into
shadows
and
emptiness
but
jimbo
was
a
brave
boy
there
was
nothing
of
the
coward
in
him
though
his
sensitive
temperament
made
him
sometimes
hesitate
where
an
ordinary
child
with
less
imagination
would
have
acted
promptly
the
desire
to
cry
he
thrust
down
and
repressed
fighting
his
depression
by
the
thought
that
within
a
few
hours
the
voice
might
sound
that
should
call
him
to
the
excitement
of
the
last
flight
and
freedom
the
rest
of
the
daylight
slipped
away
very
quickly
and
the
room
was
full
of
shadows
almost
before
he
knew
it
then
came
the
darkness
outside
the
wind
rose
and
fell
fitfully
booming
in
the
chimney
with
hollow
music
and
sighing
round
the
walls
of
the
house
a
few
stars
peeped
between
the
branches
of
the
elms
but
masses
of
cloud
hid
most
of
the
sky
and
the
air
felt
heavy
with
coming
rain
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
waited
at
the
least
sound
he
started
thinking
it
might
be
the
call
from
the
governess
but
the
few
sounds
he
did
hear
always
resolved
themselves
into
the
moaning
of
the
wind
and
no
voice
came
with
his
eyes
on
the
open
window
trying
to
pierce
the
gloom
and
find
the
stars
he
lay
motionless
for
hours
while
the
night
wore
on
and
the
shadows
deepened
and
during
those
long
hours
of
darkness
and
silence
he
was
conscious
that
a
change
was
going
on
within
him
name
it
he
could
not
but
somehow
it
made
him
feel
that
living
people
like
himself
were
standing
near
trying
to
speak
beckoning
anxious
to
bring
him
back
into
their
own
particular
world
the
darkness
was
so
great
that
he
could
see
only
the
square
outline
of
the
open
window
but
he
felt
sure
that
any
sudden
flash
of
light
would
have
revealed
a
group
of
persons
round
his
bed
with
arms
outstretched
trying
to
reach
him
the
emotion
they
roused
in
him
was
not
fear
for
he
felt
sure
they
were
kind
and
eager
only
to
help
him
and
the
more
he
realised
their
presence
the
less
he
thought
about
the
governess
who
had
been
doing
so
much
to
make
his
escape
possible
then
too
voices
began
to
sound
somewhere
in
the
air
but
he
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
actually
in
the
room
or
outside
in
the
night
or
only
within
himself
in
his
own
head
strange
faint
voices
whispering
laughing
shouting
crying
fragments
of
stories
rhymes
riddles
odd
names
of
people
and
places
jostled
one
another
with
varying
degrees
of
clearness
now
loud
now
soft
till
he
wondered
what
it
all
meant
and
longed
for
the
light
to
come
but
besides
all
this
something
else
too
was
abroad
that
night
something
he
could
not
name
or
even
think
about
without
shaking
with
terror
down
at
the
very
roots
of
his
being
and
when
he
thought
of
this
his
heart
called
loudly
for
the
governess
and
the
people
hidden
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
seemed
quite
useless
and
unable
to
help
thus
he
hovered
between
the
two
worlds
and
the
two
memories
phantoms
and
realities
shifting
and
changing
places
every
few
minutes
a
little
light
would
have
saved
him
much
suffering
if
only
the
moon
were
up
moonlight
would
have
made
all
the
difference
even
a
moon
half
hidden
and
misty
would
have
put
the
shadows
farther
away
from
him
dear
old
misty
moon
he
cried
half
aloud
to
himself
upon
the
bed
why
are
you
here
my
last
night
misty
moon
misty
moon
the
words
kept
ringing
in
his
head
misty
moon
misty
moon
they
swam
round
in
his
blood
in
an
odd
tumultuous
rhythm
every
time
the
current
of
blood
passed
through
his
brain
in
the
course
of
its
circulation
it
brought
the
words
with
it
altered
a
little
and
singing
like
a
voice
like
a
voice
suddenly
he
made
the
discovery
that
it
actually
a
voice
and
not
his
own
it
was
no
longer
the
blood
singing
in
his
veins
it
was
some
one
singing
outside
the
window
the
sound
began
faintly
and
far
away
up
above
the
trees
then
it
came
gradually
nearer
only
to
die
away
again
almost
to
a
whisper
if
it
was
not
the
voice
of
the
governess
he
could
only
say
it
was
a
very
good
imitation
of
it
the
words
forming
out
of
the
empty
air
rose
and
fell
with
the
wind
and
taking
his
thoughts
flung
them
in
a
stream
through
the
dark
sky
towards
the
hidden
misty
moon
o
misty
moon
dear
misty
moon
the
nights
are
long
without
thee
the
shadows
creep
across
my
sleep
and
fold
their
wings
about
me
and
another
silvery
voice
that
might
have
been
the
voice
of
a
star
took
it
up
faintly
evidently
from
a
much
greater
distance
o
misty
moon
sweet
misty
moon
the
stars
are
dim
behind
thee
and
lo
thy
beams
spin
through
my
dreams
and
weave
a
veil
to
blind
me
the
sound
of
this
beautiful
voice
so
delighted
jimbo
that
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
rushed
to
the
window
hoping
that
he
might
be
able
to
hear
it
more
clearly
but
before
he
got
across
the
room
he
stopped
short
trembling
with
terror
underneath
his
very
feet
in
the
depths
of
the
house
he
heard
the
awful
voice
he
dreaded
more
than
anything
else
it
roared
out
the
lines
with
a
sound
like
the
rushing
of
a
great
river
o
misty
moon
pale
misty
moon
thy
songs
are
nightly
driven
eternally
from
sky
to
sky
the
old
grey
hills
of
heaven
and
after
the
verse
jimbo
heard
a
great
peal
of
laughter
that
seemed
to
shake
the
walls
of
the
house
and
rooted
his
feet
to
the
floor
it
rolled
away
with
thundering
echoes
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
he
just
managed
to
crawl
back
to
his
mattress
and
lie
down
when
another
voice
took
up
the
song
but
this
time
in
accents
so
tender
that
the
child
felt
something
within
him
melt
into
tears
of
joy
and
he
was
on
the
verge
of
recognising
for
the
first
time
since
his
accident
the
voice
of
his
mother
o
misty
moon
shy
misty
moon
whence
comes
the
blush
that
trembles
in
sweet
disgrace
half
thy
face
when
night
her
stars
assembles
but
his
memory
of
course
failed
him
just
as
he
seemed
about
to
grasp
it
and
he
was
left
wondering
why
the
sound
of
that
one
voice
had
brought
him
a
moment
of
radiant
happiness
in
the
midst
of
so
much
horror
and
pain
meanwhile
the
answering
voices
went
on
each
time
different
and
in
new
directions
but
the
next
verse
somehow
brought
back
to
him
all
the
terror
he
had
felt
in
his
flight
over
the
sea
when
the
sound
of
the
hissing
waters
had
reached
his
ears
through
the
carpet
of
fog
o
misty
moon
persuasive
moon
earth
tides
are
ever
rising
by
the
awful
grace
of
thy
weird
white
face
leap
the
seas
to
thy
enticing
then
followed
the
voice
that
had
started
the
horrid
song
this
time
he
was
sure
it
was
not
miss
lake
voice
but
only
a
very
clever
imitation
of
it
moreover
it
again
ended
in
a
shriek
of
laughter
that
froze
his
blood
o
misty
moon
deceiving
moon
thy
silvery
glance
brings
sadness
who
flies
to
thee
from
land
or
sea
shall
end
his
days
in
madness
other
voices
began
to
laugh
and
sing
but
jimbo
stopped
his
ears
for
he
simply
could
not
bear
any
more
he
felt
certain
too
that
these
strange
words
to
the
moon
had
all
been
part
of
a
trap
a
device
to
draw
him
to
the
window
he
shuddered
to
think
how
nearly
he
had
fallen
into
it
and
determined
to
lie
on
the
bed
and
wait
till
he
heard
his
companion
calling
and
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
was
she
but
the
night
passed
away
and
the
dawn
came
and
no
voice
had
called
him
forth
to
the
last
flight
hitherto
in
all
his
experiences
there
had
been
only
one
absolute
certainty
the
appearance
of
the
governess
with
the
morning
light
but
this
time
sunrise
came
and
the
clouds
cleared
away
and
the
sweet
smells
of
field
and
air
stole
into
the
little
room
yet
without
any
sign
of
the
governess
the
hours
passed
and
she
did
not
come
till
finally
he
realised
that
she
was
not
coming
at
all
and
he
would
have
to
spend
the
whole
day
alone
something
had
happened
to
prevent
her
or
else
it
was
all
part
of
her
mysterious
plan
he
did
not
know
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
wait
and
wonder
and
hope
all
day
long
he
lay
and
waited
and
all
day
long
he
was
alone
the
never
once
moved
the
courtyard
remained
empty
and
deserted
there
was
no
sound
on
the
landing
or
on
the
stairs
no
wind
stirred
the
leaves
outside
and
the
hot
sun
poured
down
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
he
stood
by
the
open
window
for
hours
watching
the
motionless
branches
everything
seemed
dead
not
even
a
bird
crossed
his
field
of
vision
the
loneliness
the
awful
silence
and
above
all
the
dread
of
the
approaching
night
were
sometimes
more
than
he
seemed
able
to
bear
and
he
wanted
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
scream
or
lie
down
on
the
bed
and
cry
his
heart
out
but
he
yielded
to
neither
impulse
he
kept
a
brave
heart
knowing
that
this
would
be
his
last
night
in
prison
and
that
in
a
few
hours
time
he
would
hear
his
name
called
out
of
the
sky
and
would
dash
through
the
window
to
liberty
and
the
last
wild
flight
this
thought
gave
him
courage
and
he
kept
all
his
energy
for
the
great
effort
gradually
once
more
the
sunlight
faded
and
the
darkness
began
to
creep
over
the
land
never
before
had
the
shadows
under
the
elms
looked
so
fantastic
nor
the
bushes
in
the
field
beyond
assumed
such
sinister
shapes
the
empty
house
was
being
gradually
invested
the
enemy
was
masquerading
already
under
cover
of
these
very
shadows
very
soon
he
felt
the
attack
would
begin
and
he
must
be
ready
to
act
the
night
came
down
at
last
with
a
strange
suddenness
and
with
it
the
warning
of
the
governess
came
back
to
him
he
thought
quakingly
of
the
stricken
children
who
had
been
caught
and
deprived
of
their
wings
and
then
he
pulled
out
his
long
red
feathers
and
tried
their
strength
and
gained
thus
fresh
confidence
in
their
power
to
save
him
when
the
time
came
chapter
xvii
off
with
the
full
darkness
a
whole
army
of
horrors
crept
nearer
he
felt
sure
of
this
though
he
could
actually
see
nothing
the
house
was
surrounded
the
courtyard
crowded
outside
on
the
stairs
in
the
other
rooms
even
on
the
roof
itself
waited
dreadful
things
ready
to
catch
him
to
tear
off
his
wings
to
make
him
prisoner
for
ever
and
ever
the
possibility
that
something
had
happened
to
the
governess
now
became
a
probability
imperceptibly
the
change
was
wrought
he
could
not
say
how
or
when
exactly
but
he
now
felt
almost
certain
that
the
effort
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
had
succeeded
if
this
were
true
the
boy
only
hope
lay
in
his
wings
and
he
pulled
them
out
to
their
full
length
and
kissed
them
passionately
speaking
to
the
strong
red
feathers
as
if
they
were
living
little
persons
you
must
save
me
you
will
save
me
wo
you
he
cried
in
his
anguish
and
every
time
he
did
this
and
looked
at
them
he
gained
fresh
hope
and
courage
the
problem
he
was
to
fly
had
not
yet
insisted
on
a
solution
though
it
lay
always
at
the
back
of
his
mind
for
the
final
flight
of
escape
without
a
guide
had
never
been
even
a
possibility
before
lying
there
alone
in
the
darkness
waiting
for
the
sound
of
the
voice
so
he
found
his
thoughts
turning
again
to
the
moon
and
the
strange
words
of
the
song
that
had
puzzled
him
the
night
before
what
in
the
world
did
it
all
mean
why
all
this
about
the
moon
why
was
it
a
cruel
moon
and
why
should
it
attract
and
persuade
and
entice
him
he
felt
sure
the
more
he
thought
of
it
that
this
had
all
been
a
device
to
draw
him
to
the
window
and
perhaps
even
farther
the
darkness
began
to
terrify
him
he
dreaded
more
and
more
the
waiting
listening
things
that
it
concealed
oh
when
would
the
governess
call
to
him
when
would
he
be
able
to
dash
through
the
open
window
and
join
her
in
the
sky
he
thought
of
the
sunlight
that
had
flooded
the
yard
all
day
so
bright
it
seemed
to
have
come
from
a
sun
fresh
made
and
shining
for
the
first
time
he
thought
of
the
exquisite
flowers
that
grew
in
the
fields
just
beyond
the
high
wall
and
the
night
smells
of
the
earth
reached
him
through
the
window
wafted
in
upon
a
wind
heavy
with
secrets
of
woods
and
fields
they
all
came
from
a
land
of
magic
that
after
might
be
for
ever
beyond
his
reach
and
they
went
straight
to
his
heart
and
immediately
turned
something
solid
there
into
tears
but
the
tears
did
not
find
their
natural
expression
and
jimbo
lay
there
fighting
with
his
pain
keeping
all
his
strength
for
the
one
great
effort
and
waiting
for
the
voice
that
at
any
minute
now
might
sound
above
the
but
the
hours
passed
and
the
voice
did
not
come
how
he
loathed
the
room
and
everything
in
it
the
ceiling
stretched
like
a
white
staring
countenance
above
him
the
walls
watched
and
listened
and
even
the
mantelpiece
grew
into
the
semblance
of
a
creature
with
shoulders
bending
over
him
the
whole
room
indeed
seemed
to
his
frightened
soul
to
run
into
the
shape
of
a
monstrous
person
whose
arms
were
outstretched
in
all
directions
to
prevent
his
escape
his
hands
never
left
his
wings
now
he
stroked
and
fondled
them
arranging
the
feathers
smoothly
and
speaking
to
them
under
his
breath
just
as
though
they
were
living
things
to
him
they
were
indeed
alive
and
he
knew
when
the
time
came
they
would
not
fail
him
the
fierce
passion
for
the
open
spaces
took
possession
of
his
soul
and
his
whole
being
began
to
cry
out
for
freedom
rushing
wind
the
stars
and
a
pathless
sky
slowly
the
power
of
the
great
open
night
entered
his
heart
bringing
with
it
a
courage
that
enabled
him
to
keep
the
terrors
of
the
house
at
a
distance
so
far
the
boy
strength
had
been
equal
to
the
task
but
a
moment
was
approaching
when
the
tension
would
be
too
great
to
bear
and
the
long
force
would
rush
forth
into
an
act
jimbo
realised
this
quite
clearly
though
he
could
not
exactly
express
it
in
words
he
felt
that
his
real
hope
of
escape
lay
in
the
success
of
that
act
meanwhile
with
more
than
a
child
wisdom
he
stored
up
every
particle
of
strength
he
had
for
the
great
moment
when
it
should
come
a
light
wind
had
risen
soon
after
sunset
but
as
the
night
wore
on
it
began
to
fail
dropping
away
into
little
silences
that
grew
each
time
longer
in
the
heart
of
one
of
these
spells
of
silence
jimbo
presently
noticed
a
new
sound
a
sound
that
he
recognised
far
away
at
first
but
growing
in
distinctness
with
every
dropping
of
the
wind
this
new
sound
rose
from
the
interior
of
the
house
below
and
came
gradually
upon
him
it
was
voices
faintly
singing
and
the
tread
of
stealthy
footsteps
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
sound
till
at
length
they
reached
the
door
and
there
passed
into
the
room
a
wave
of
fine
gentle
sound
that
woke
no
echo
and
scarcely
seemed
to
stir
the
air
into
vibration
at
all
the
door
had
opened
and
a
number
of
voices
were
singing
softly
under
their
breath
and
after
the
sounds
creeping
slowly
like
some
timid
animal
there
came
into
the
room
a
small
black
figure
just
visible
in
the
faint
starlight
it
peered
round
the
edge
of
the
door
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
advanced
with
an
odd
rhythmical
sort
of
motion
and
after
the
first
figure
came
a
second
and
after
the
second
a
third
and
then
several
entered
together
till
a
whole
group
of
them
stood
on
the
floor
between
jimbo
and
the
open
window
then
he
recognised
the
frightened
children
and
his
heart
sank
even
they
he
saw
were
arrayed
against
him
and
took
it
for
granted
that
he
already
belonged
to
them
oh
why
did
not
the
governess
come
for
him
why
was
there
no
voice
in
the
sky
he
glanced
with
longing
towards
the
heavens
and
as
the
children
moved
past
he
was
almost
certain
that
he
saw
the
stars
their
bodies
too
slowly
they
shuffled
across
the
floor
till
they
formed
a
semicircle
round
the
bed
and
then
they
began
a
silent
impish
dance
that
made
the
flesh
creep
their
thin
forms
were
dressed
in
black
gowns
like
shrouds
and
as
they
moved
through
the
steps
of
the
bizarre
measure
he
saw
that
their
legs
were
little
more
than
mere
skin
and
bone
their
faces
what
he
could
see
of
them
when
he
dared
to
open
his
eyes
were
pale
as
ashes
and
their
beady
little
eyes
shone
like
the
facets
of
cut
stones
flashing
in
all
directions
and
while
they
danced
in
and
out
amongst
each
other
never
breaking
the
semicircle
round
the
bed
they
sang
a
low
mournful
song
that
sounded
like
the
wind
whispering
through
a
leafless
wood
and
the
words
stirred
in
him
that
vague
yet
terrible
fear
known
to
all
children
who
have
been
frightened
and
made
to
feel
afraid
of
the
dark
evidently
his
sensations
were
being
merged
very
rapidly
now
into
those
of
the
little
boy
in
the
bed
there
is
someone
in
the
nursery
whom
we
never
saw
before
why
hangs
the
moon
so
red
and
he
came
not
by
the
passage
or
the
window
or
the
door
why
hangs
the
moon
so
red
and
he
stands
there
in
the
darkness
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
see
where
the
moon
hangs
red
someone
hiding
in
the
passage
where
the
door
begins
to
swing
why
drive
the
clouds
so
fast
in
the
corner
by
the
staircase
there
a
dreadful
waiting
thing
why
drive
the
clouds
so
fast
past
the
curtain
creeps
a
monster
with
a
black
and
fluttering
wing
see
where
the
clouds
drive
fast
in
the
chilly
dusk
of
evening
in
the
hush
before
the
dawn
why
drips
the
rain
so
cold
in
the
twilight
of
the
garden
in
the
mist
upon
the
lawn
why
drips
the
rain
so
cold
faces
stare
and
mouth
upon
us
faces
white
and
weird
and
drawn
see
how
the
rain
drips
cold
close
beside
us
in
the
waiting
for
us
in
the
gloom
o
why
sings
the
wind
so
shrill
in
the
shadows
by
the
cupboard
in
the
corners
of
the
room
o
why
sings
the
wind
so
shrill
from
the
corridors
and
landings
voices
call
us
to
our
doom
o
how
the
wind
sings
shrill
by
this
time
the
dreadful
dancers
had
come
much
closer
to
him
shifting
stealthily
nearer
to
the
bed
under
cover
of
their
dancing
and
always
him
and
the
suddenly
their
intention
flashed
upon
him
they
meant
to
prevent
his
escape
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
sprang
from
the
bed
as
he
did
so
a
dozen
pairs
of
thin
shadowy
arms
shot
out
towards
him
as
though
to
seize
his
wings
but
with
an
agility
born
of
fright
he
dodged
them
and
ran
swiftly
into
the
corner
by
the
mantelpiece
standing
with
his
back
against
the
wall
he
faced
the
children
and
strove
to
call
out
for
help
to
the
governess
but
this
time
there
was
an
entirely
new
difficulty
in
the
way
for
he
found
to
his
utter
dismay
that
his
voice
refused
to
make
itself
heard
his
mouth
was
dry
and
his
tongue
would
hardly
stir
not
a
sound
issued
from
his
lips
but
the
children
instantly
moved
forwards
and
hemmed
him
in
between
them
and
the
wall
and
to
reach
the
window
he
would
have
to
break
through
this
semicircle
of
whispering
shadowy
forms
above
their
heads
he
could
see
the
stars
shining
and
any
moment
he
might
hear
miss
lake
voice
calling
to
him
to
come
out
his
heart
rose
with
passionate
longing
within
him
and
he
gathered
his
wings
tightly
about
him
ready
for
the
final
dash
it
would
take
more
than
the
frightened
children
to
hold
him
prisoner
when
once
he
heard
that
voice
or
even
without
it
whether
they
were
astonished
at
his
boldness
or
merely
waiting
their
opportunity
later
he
could
not
tell
but
anyhow
they
kept
their
distance
for
a
time
and
made
no
further
attempt
to
seize
his
feathers
whispering
together
under
their
breath
sometimes
singing
their
mournful
sighing
songs
sometimes
sinking
their
voices
to
a
confused
murmur
they
moved
in
and
out
amongst
each
other
with
soundless
feet
like
the
shadows
of
branches
swaying
in
the
wind
then
suddenly
they
moved
closer
and
stretched
out
their
arms
towards
him
their
bodies
swaying
rhythmically
together
while
their
combined
voices
raised
just
above
a
whisper
sang
to
him
dare
you
fly
out
when
the
moon
is
so
strong
though
the
stars
are
so
bright
there
is
death
in
their
song
you
a
hostage
to
fright
and
to
us
you
belong
dare
you
fly
out
alone
through
the
shadows
that
wave
when
the
course
is
unknown
and
there
no
one
to
save
you
are
bone
of
our
bone
and
for
ever
his
slave
and
following
these
words
came
from
somewhere
in
the
air
that
voice
like
the
thunder
of
a
river
jimbo
knew
only
too
well
to
whom
it
belonged
as
he
listened
to
the
rhyme
of
the
west
wind
for
the
wind
of
the
west
is
a
wind
unblest
and
its
dangerous
breath
will
entice
you
to
death
fly
not
with
the
wind
of
the
west
o
child
with
the
terrible
wind
of
the
west
but
the
boy
knew
perfectly
well
that
these
efforts
to
stop
him
were
all
part
of
a
trap
they
were
lying
to
him
it
was
not
the
wind
of
the
west
at
all
was
the
south
that
at
least
he
knew
by
the
odours
that
were
wafted
in
through
the
window
again
he
tried
to
call
to
the
governess
but
his
tongue
lay
stiff
in
his
mouth
and
no
sound
came
meanwhile
the
children
began
to
draw
closer
hemming
him
in
they
moved
almost
imperceptibly
but
he
saw
plainly
that
the
circle
was
growing
smaller
and
smaller
his
legs
began
to
tremble
and
he
felt
that
soon
he
would
collapse
and
drop
at
their
feet
for
his
strength
was
failing
and
the
power
to
act
and
move
was
slowly
leaving
him
the
little
shadowy
figures
were
almost
touching
him
when
suddenly
a
new
sound
broke
the
stillness
and
set
every
nerve
tingling
in
his
body
something
was
shuffling
along
the
landing
he
heard
it
outside
pushing
against
the
door
the
handle
turned
with
a
rattle
and
a
moment
later
the
door
slowly
opened
for
a
second
jimbo
breath
failed
him
and
he
nearly
fell
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
round
the
edge
of
the
door
he
saw
a
dim
huge
figure
come
crawling
into
the
room
creeping
along
the
floor
and
trailing
behind
it
a
pair
of
immense
black
wings
that
stretched
along
the
boards
for
one
brief
second
he
stared
and
wondering
what
it
was
but
before
the
whole
length
of
the
creature
was
in
he
knew
it
was
fright
himself
he
was
making
steadily
for
the
window
the
shock
instantly
galvanised
the
boy
into
a
state
of
activity
again
he
recovered
the
use
of
all
his
muscles
and
all
his
faculties
his
voice
released
by
terror
rang
out
in
a
wild
shriek
for
help
to
the
governess
and
he
dashed
forward
across
the
room
in
a
mad
rush
for
the
window
unless
he
could
reach
it
before
the
other
he
would
be
a
prisoner
for
the
rest
of
his
life
it
was
now
or
never
the
instant
he
moved
the
children
came
straight
at
him
with
hands
outstretched
to
stop
him
but
he
passed
through
them
as
if
they
were
smoke
and
with
almost
a
single
bound
sprang
upon
the
narrow
to
do
this
he
had
to
clear
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
creature
on
the
floor
and
though
he
accomplished
it
successfully
he
felt
himself
clutched
from
behind
for
a
second
he
balanced
doubtfully
on
the
window
ledge
he
felt
himself
being
pulled
back
into
the
room
and
he
combined
all
his
forces
into
one
tremendous
effort
to
rush
forward
there
was
a
ripping
tearing
sound
as
he
sprang
into
the
air
with
a
yell
of
mingled
terror
and
exultation
his
prompt
action
and
the
fierce
impetus
had
saved
him
he
was
free
but
in
the
awful
hand
that
seized
him
he
had
left
behind
the
end
feathers
of
his
right
wing
a
few
inches
more
and
it
would
have
been
not
merely
the
feathers
but
the
entire
wing
itself
he
dropped
to
within
three
feet
of
the
stones
in
the
yard
and
then
borne
aloft
by
the
kind
rushing
wind
of
the
south
he
rose
in
a
tremendous
sweep
far
over
the
tops
of
the
high
elms
and
out
into
the
heart
of
the
night
only
there
was
no
governess
voice
to
guide
him
and
behind
him
a
little
lower
down
a
black
pursuing
figure
with
huge
wings
flapped
heavily
as
it
followed
with
laborious
flight
through
the
darkness
chapter
xviii
home
but
it
was
the
sound
of
something
crashing
heavily
through
the
top
branches
of
the
elms
that
made
the
boy
realise
he
was
actually
being
followed
and
all
his
efforts
became
concentrated
into
the
desire
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
himself
and
the
horror
of
the
empty
house
he
heard
the
noise
of
big
wings
far
beneath
him
and
his
one
idea
was
to
his
pursuer
and
then
come
down
again
to
earth
and
rest
his
wings
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
till
he
could
devise
some
plan
how
to
find
the
governess
so
at
first
he
raced
at
full
speed
through
the
air
taking
no
thought
of
direction
when
he
looked
down
all
he
could
see
was
that
something
vague
and
shadowy
shaking
out
a
pair
of
enormous
wings
between
him
and
the
earth
move
along
with
him
its
path
was
parallel
with
his
own
but
apparently
it
made
no
effort
to
rise
up
to
his
higher
level
it
thundered
along
far
beneath
him
and
instinctively
he
raised
his
head
and
steered
more
and
more
upwards
and
away
from
the
world
the
gap
at
the
end
of
his
right
wing
where
the
feathers
had
been
torn
out
seemed
to
make
no
difference
in
his
power
of
flight
or
steering
and
he
went
tearing
through
the
night
at
a
pace
he
had
never
dared
to
try
before
and
at
a
height
he
had
never
yet
reached
in
any
of
the
practice
flights
he
soared
higher
even
than
he
knew
and
perhaps
this
was
fortunate
for
the
friction
of
the
lower
atmosphere
might
have
heated
him
to
the
point
of
igniting
and
some
watcher
at
one
of
earth
windows
might
have
suddenly
seen
a
brilliant
little
meteor
flash
through
the
night
and
vanish
into
dust
at
first
the
joy
of
escape
was
the
only
idea
his
mind
seemed
able
to
grasp
he
revelled
in
a
passionate
sense
of
freedom
and
all
his
energies
poured
themselves
into
one
concentrated
effort
to
fly
faster
faster
faster
but
after
a
time
when
the
pursuer
had
been
apparently
outflown
and
he
realised
that
escape
was
an
accomplished
fact
he
began
to
search
for
the
governess
calling
to
her
rising
and
falling
darting
in
all
directions
and
then
hovering
on
outstretched
wings
to
try
and
catch
some
sound
of
a
friendly
voice
but
no
answer
came
either
from
the
stars
that
crowded
the
vault
above
or
from
the
dark
surface
of
the
world
below
only
silence
answered
his
cries
and
his
voice
was
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
immensity
of
space
almost
the
moment
it
left
his
lips
presently
he
began
to
realise
to
what
an
appalling
distance
he
had
risen
above
the
world
and
with
anxious
eyes
he
tried
to
pierce
the
gaping
emptiness
beneath
him
and
on
all
sides
but
this
vast
sea
of
air
had
nothing
to
reveal
the
stars
shone
like
pinholes
of
gold
pricked
in
a
deep
black
curtain
and
the
moon
now
rising
slowly
spread
a
veil
of
silver
between
him
and
the
upper
regions
there
was
not
a
cloud
anywhere
and
the
winds
were
all
asleep
he
was
alone
in
space
yet
as
the
swishing
of
his
feathers
slackened
and
the
roar
in
his
ears
died
away
he
heard
in
the
short
pause
the
ominous
beating
of
great
wings
somewhere
in
the
depths
beneath
him
and
knew
that
the
great
pursuer
was
still
on
his
track
the
glare
of
the
moon
now
made
it
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
properly
and
in
these
huge
spaces
with
nothing
to
guide
the
eye
it
was
difficult
to
know
exactly
from
what
direction
the
sound
came
he
was
only
sure
of
one
thing
that
it
was
far
below
him
and
that
for
the
present
it
did
not
seem
to
come
much
nearer
the
cry
for
help
that
kept
rising
to
his
lips
he
suppressed
for
it
would
only
have
served
to
guide
his
pursuer
and
moreover
a
cry
a
little
thin
despairing
cry
was
instantly
lost
in
these
great
heavens
it
was
less
than
a
drop
in
an
ocean
on
and
on
he
flew
always
pointing
away
from
the
earth
and
trying
hard
to
think
where
he
would
find
safety
would
this
awful
creature
hunt
him
all
night
long
into
the
daylight
or
would
he
be
forced
back
into
the
empty
house
in
sheer
exhaustion
the
thought
gave
him
new
impetus
and
with
powerful
strokes
he
dashed
onwards
and
upwards
through
the
wilderness
of
space
in
which
the
only
pathways
were
the
little
golden
tracks
of
the
starbeams
the
governess
would
turn
up
somewhere
he
was
positive
of
that
she
had
never
failed
him
yet
so
alone
and
breathless
he
pursued
his
flight
and
the
higher
he
went
the
more
the
tremendous
vault
opened
up
into
inconceivable
and
untold
distances
his
speed
kept
increasing
he
thought
he
had
never
found
flying
so
easy
before
and
the
thunder
of
the
following
wings
that
held
persistently
on
his
track
made
it
dangerous
for
him
to
slacken
up
for
more
than
a
minute
here
and
there
the
earth
became
a
dark
blot
beneath
him
while
the
moon
rising
higher
and
higher
grew
weirdly
bright
and
close
how
black
the
sky
was
how
piercing
the
points
of
starlight
how
stimulating
the
strong
new
odours
of
these
lofty
regions
he
realised
with
a
thrill
of
genuine
awe
that
he
had
flown
over
the
very
edge
of
the
world
and
the
moment
the
thought
entered
his
mind
it
was
flung
back
at
him
by
a
voice
that
seemed
close
to
his
ear
one
moment
and
the
next
was
miles
away
in
the
space
overhead
light
thoughts
born
of
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
of
his
great
speed
danced
before
his
mind
in
fanciful
array
once
he
laughed
aloud
at
them
but
once
only
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
these
echoless
spaces
made
him
afraid
the
speed
too
affected
his
vision
for
at
one
moment
thin
clouds
stretched
across
his
face
and
the
next
he
was
whirling
through
perfectly
clear
air
again
with
no
vestige
of
a
cloud
in
sight
the
same
reason
doubtless
explained
the
sudden
presence
of
sheets
of
light
in
the
air
that
reflected
the
moonlight
like
particles
of
glittering
ice
and
then
suddenly
disappeared
again
the
terrific
speed
would
explain
a
good
many
things
but
certainly
it
was
curious
how
creatures
formed
out
of
the
hollow
darkness
like
foam
before
a
steamer
bows
and
moved
noiselessly
away
on
either
side
to
join
the
army
of
dim
life
that
crowded
everywhere
and
watched
his
passage
for
in
front
and
on
both
sides
there
gathered
a
vast
assembly
of
silent
forms
more
than
shadows
less
than
bodily
shapes
that
opened
up
a
pathway
as
he
rushed
through
them
and
then
immediately
closed
up
their
ranks
again
when
he
had
passed
the
air
seemed
packed
with
living
creatures
space
was
filled
with
them
they
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
yet
his
passage
through
them
was
like
the
passage
of
a
hand
through
smoke
it
was
easy
to
make
a
pathway
but
the
pathway
left
no
traces
behind
it
more
smoke
rushed
in
and
filled
the
void
he
could
never
see
these
things
properly
face
to
face
they
always
kept
just
out
of
the
line
of
vision
like
shadows
that
follow
a
lonely
walker
in
a
wood
and
vanish
the
moment
he
turns
to
look
at
them
over
his
shoulder
but
ever
by
his
side
with
a
steady
effortless
motion
he
knew
they
kept
up
with
him
strange
inhabitants
of
the
airless
heights
immense
and
with
veiled
flaming
eyes
and
silent
feathers
he
was
not
afraid
of
them
for
they
were
neither
friendly
nor
hostile
they
were
simply
the
beings
of
another
world
alien
and
unknown
but
what
puzzled
him
more
was
that
the
light
and
the
darkness
seemed
separate
things
each
distinctly
visible
after
each
stroke
of
his
wings
he
the
sift
downwards
past
him
through
the
air
like
dust
it
floated
all
round
him
in
thinnest
diaphanous
texture
visible
not
because
the
moonlight
made
it
so
but
because
in
its
inmost
soul
it
was
itself
luminous
it
rose
and
fell
in
eddies
swirling
wreaths
and
undulations
inwoven
with
starbeams
as
with
golden
thread
it
clothed
him
about
in
circles
of
some
magical
primordial
substance
even
the
stars
looking
down
upon
him
from
terrifying
heights
seemed
now
draped
now
undraped
as
if
by
the
sweeping
of
enormous
wings
that
stirred
these
sheets
of
visible
darkness
into
a
vast
system
of
circulation
through
the
heavens
everything
in
these
oceans
of
upper
space
apparently
made
use
of
wings
or
the
idea
of
wings
perhaps
even
the
great
earth
itself
rolling
from
star
to
star
was
moved
by
the
power
of
gigantic
invisible
wings
jimbo
realised
he
had
entered
a
forbidden
region
he
began
to
feel
afraid
but
the
only
possible
expression
of
his
fear
and
its
only
possible
relief
lay
in
his
own
wings
and
he
used
them
with
redoubled
energy
he
dashed
forward
so
fast
that
his
face
begun
to
burn
and
he
kept
turning
his
head
in
every
direction
for
a
sign
of
the
governess
or
for
some
indication
of
where
he
could
in
the
pauses
of
the
wild
flight
he
heard
the
thunder
of
the
following
wings
below
they
were
still
on
his
trail
and
it
seemed
that
they
were
gaining
on
him
he
took
a
new
angle
realising
that
his
only
chance
was
to
fly
high
and
the
new
course
took
him
perpendicularly
away
from
the
earth
and
straight
towards
the
moon
later
when
he
had
the
other
creature
he
would
drop
down
again
to
safer
levels
yet
the
hours
passed
and
it
never
overtook
him
a
measured
distance
was
steadily
kept
up
between
them
as
though
with
calculated
purpose
curious
distant
voices
shouted
from
time
to
time
all
manner
of
sentences
and
rhymes
in
his
ears
but
he
could
neither
understand
nor
remember
them
more
and
more
the
awful
stillness
of
the
vast
regions
that
lie
between
the
world
and
the
moon
appalled
him
then
suddenly
a
new
sound
reached
him
that
at
first
he
could
not
in
the
least
understand
it
reached
him
however
not
through
the
ears
but
by
a
steady
trembling
of
the
whole
surface
of
his
body
it
set
him
in
vibration
all
over
and
for
some
time
he
had
no
idea
what
it
meant
the
trembling
ran
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
body
till
at
last
a
single
powerful
regular
vibration
took
complete
possession
of
his
whole
being
and
he
felt
as
though
he
was
being
wrapped
round
and
absorbed
by
this
vast
and
gigantic
sound
he
had
always
thought
that
the
voice
of
fright
like
the
roar
of
a
river
was
the
loudest
and
deepest
sound
he
had
ever
heard
even
that
set
his
soul
but
this
new
tremendous
of
a
voice
came
not
that
way
and
could
not
be
compared
to
it
the
voice
of
the
other
was
a
mere
tickling
of
the
ear
compared
to
this
awful
crashing
of
seas
and
mountains
and
falling
worlds
it
must
break
him
to
pieces
he
felt
suddenly
he
knew
what
it
was
and
for
a
second
his
wings
failed
him
he
had
reached
such
a
height
that
he
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
world
as
it
thundered
along
its
journey
through
space
that
was
the
meaning
of
this
voice
of
majesty
that
set
him
all
and
before
long
he
would
probably
hear
too
the
voices
of
the
planets
and
the
singing
of
the
great
moon
the
governess
had
warned
him
about
this
at
the
first
sound
of
these
awful
voices
she
told
him
to
turn
instantly
and
drop
back
to
the
earth
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
drop
jimbo
turned
instinctively
and
began
to
fall
but
before
he
had
dropped
half
a
mile
he
met
once
again
the
ascending
sound
of
the
wings
that
had
followed
him
from
the
empty
house
it
was
no
good
flying
straight
into
destruction
he
summoned
all
his
courage
and
turned
once
more
towards
the
stars
anything
was
better
than
being
caught
and
held
for
ever
by
fright
and
with
a
wild
cry
for
help
that
fell
dead
in
the
empty
spaces
he
renewed
his
unending
flight
towards
the
stars
but
meanwhile
the
pursuer
had
distinctly
gained
appalled
by
the
mighty
thunder
of
the
stars
voices
above
and
by
the
prospect
of
immediate
capture
if
he
turned
back
jimbo
flew
blindly
on
towards
the
moon
regardless
of
consequences
and
below
him
the
pursuer
came
closer
and
closer
the
strokes
of
its
wings
were
no
longer
mere
distant
thuds
that
he
heard
when
he
paused
in
his
own
flight
to
listen
they
were
the
audible
swishing
of
feathers
it
was
near
enough
for
that
jimbo
could
never
properly
see
what
was
following
him
a
shadow
between
him
and
the
earth
was
all
he
could
distinguish
but
in
the
centre
of
that
shadow
there
seemed
to
burn
two
glowing
eyes
two
brilliant
lights
flashed
whenever
he
looked
down
like
the
lamps
of
a
revolving
lighthouse
but
other
things
he
saw
too
when
he
looked
down
and
once
the
earth
rose
close
to
his
face
so
that
he
could
have
touched
it
with
his
hands
the
same
instant
it
dropped
away
again
with
a
rush
of
whirlwinds
and
became
a
distant
shadow
miles
and
miles
below
him
but
before
it
went
he
had
time
to
see
the
empty
house
standing
within
its
gloomy
yard
and
the
horror
of
it
gave
him
fresh
impetus
another
time
when
the
world
raced
up
close
to
his
eyes
he
saw
a
scene
of
a
different
kind
that
stirred
a
passionately
deep
yearning
within
him
a
house
overgrown
with
ivy
and
standing
among
trees
and
gardens
with
laburnums
and
lilacs
flowering
on
smooth
green
lawns
and
a
clean
gravel
drive
leading
down
to
a
big
pair
of
iron
gates
oh
it
all
seemed
so
familiar
perhaps
in
another
minute
the
figures
would
have
appeared
and
spoken
to
him
already
he
heard
their
voices
behind
the
bushes
but
just
before
they
appeared
the
earth
dropped
back
with
a
roar
of
a
thousand
winds
and
jimbo
saw
instead
the
shadow
of
the
pursuer
mounting
mounting
mounting
towards
him
up
he
shot
again
with
terror
in
his
heart
and
all
trembling
with
the
thunder
of
the
great
above
he
felt
like
a
leaf
in
a
hurricane
lost
dizzy
shelterless
voices
too
now
began
to
be
heard
more
frequently
they
dropped
upon
him
out
of
the
reaches
of
this
endless
void
and
with
them
sometimes
came
forms
that
shot
past
him
with
amazing
swiftness
racing
into
the
empty
beyond
as
though
sucked
into
a
vast
vacuum
the
very
stars
seemed
to
move
he
became
part
of
some
much
larger
movement
in
which
he
was
engulfed
and
merged
he
could
no
longer
think
of
himself
as
jimbo
when
he
uttered
his
own
name
he
saw
merely
a
mass
of
wind
and
colour
through
which
the
great
pulses
of
space
and
the
planets
beat
tumultuously
lapping
him
round
with
the
currents
of
a
terrific
motion
that
seemed
to
swallow
up
his
own
little
personality
entirely
while
giving
him
something
infinitely
greater
but
surely
these
small
voices
shrill
and
did
not
come
from
the
stars
these
deep
whispers
that
ran
round
the
immense
vault
overhead
and
sounded
almost
familiarly
in
his
ears
give
it
him
the
moment
he
wakes
bring
the
quick
put
the
hot
bottle
to
his
feet
immediately
the
voices
shrieked
all
round
him
turning
suddenly
into
soft
whispers
that
died
away
somewhere
among
his
feathers
the
soles
of
his
feet
began
to
glow
and
he
felt
a
gigantic
hand
laid
upon
his
throat
and
head
almost
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
lying
somewhere
on
his
back
and
people
were
bending
over
him
shouting
and
whispering
why
hangs
the
moon
so
red
cried
a
voice
that
was
instantly
drowned
in
a
chorus
of
unintelligible
whispering
the
black
cow
must
be
killed
whispered
some
one
deep
within
the
sky
why
drips
the
rain
so
cold
yelled
one
of
the
hideous
children
close
behind
him
and
a
third
called
with
a
distant
laughter
from
behind
a
star
why
sings
the
wind
so
shrill
quiet
roared
an
appalling
voice
below
as
if
all
the
rivers
of
the
world
had
suddenly
turned
loose
into
the
sky
quiet
instantly
a
star
that
had
been
hovering
for
some
time
on
the
edge
of
a
fantastic
dance
dropped
down
close
in
front
of
his
face
it
had
a
glaring
disc
with
mouth
and
eyes
an
icy
hand
seemed
laid
on
his
head
and
the
star
rushed
back
into
its
place
in
the
sky
leaving
a
trail
of
red
flame
behind
it
a
little
voice
seemed
to
go
with
it
growing
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
we
dance
with
phantoms
and
with
shadows
play
but
regardless
of
everything
jimbo
flew
onwards
and
upwards
terrified
and
helpless
though
he
was
his
thoughts
turned
without
ceasing
to
the
governess
and
he
felt
sure
that
she
would
yet
turn
up
in
time
to
save
him
from
being
caught
by
the
fright
that
pursued
or
lost
among
the
fearful
spaces
that
lay
beyond
the
stars
for
a
long
time
however
his
wings
had
been
growing
more
and
more
tired
and
the
prospect
of
being
destroyed
from
sheer
exhaustion
now
presented
itself
to
the
boy
vaguely
as
a
possible
alternative
vaguely
only
because
he
was
no
longer
able
to
think
properly
speaking
and
things
came
to
him
more
by
way
of
dull
feeling
than
anything
else
it
was
all
the
more
with
something
of
a
positive
shock
therefore
that
he
realised
the
change
for
a
change
had
come
he
was
now
sudden
by
conscious
of
an
influx
of
new
power
greater
than
anything
he
had
ever
known
before
in
any
of
his
flights
his
wings
now
suddenly
worked
as
if
by
magic
never
had
the
motion
been
so
easy
and
it
became
every
minute
easier
and
easier
he
simply
flashed
along
without
apparent
effort
an
immense
driving
power
had
entered
into
him
he
realised
that
he
could
fly
for
ever
without
getting
tired
his
pace
increased
tenfold
increased
alarmingly
the
possibility
of
exhaustion
vanished
utterly
jimbo
knew
now
that
something
was
wrong
this
new
driving
power
was
something
wholly
outside
himself
his
wings
were
working
far
too
easily
then
suddenly
he
understood
wings
were
not
working
at
all
he
was
not
being
driven
forward
from
behind
he
was
being
drawn
forward
from
in
front
he
saw
it
all
in
a
flash
miss
lake
warning
long
ago
about
the
danger
of
flying
too
high
the
last
song
of
the
frightened
children
dare
you
fly
out
alone
through
the
shadows
that
wave
when
the
course
is
unknown
and
there
no
one
to
save
the
strange
words
sung
to
him
about
the
relentless
misty
moon
and
the
object
of
the
dreadful
pursuer
in
steadily
forcing
him
upwards
and
away
from
the
earth
it
all
flashed
across
his
poor
little
dazed
mind
he
understood
at
last
he
had
soared
too
high
and
had
entered
the
sphere
of
the
attraction
the
moon
is
too
strong
and
there
death
in
the
stars
a
voice
bellowed
below
him
like
the
roar
of
a
falling
mountain
shaking
the
sky
the
child
flew
screaming
on
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
do
but
hardly
had
the
roar
died
away
when
another
voice
was
heard
a
tender
voice
a
whispering
sympathetic
voice
though
from
what
part
of
the
sky
it
came
he
could
not
tell
arrange
the
pillows
for
his
little
head
but
below
him
the
wings
of
the
pursuer
were
mounting
closer
and
closer
he
could
almost
feel
the
mighty
wind
from
their
feathers
and
hear
the
rush
of
the
great
body
between
them
it
was
impossible
to
slacken
his
speed
even
had
he
wished
no
strength
on
earth
could
have
resisted
that
terrible
power
drawing
upwards
towards
the
moon
instinctively
however
he
realised
that
he
would
rather
have
gone
forwards
than
backwards
he
never
could
have
faced
capture
by
that
dreadful
creature
behind
all
the
efforts
of
the
past
weeks
to
escape
from
fright
the
owner
of
the
empty
house
now
acted
upon
him
with
a
cumulative
effect
and
added
to
the
suction
of
the
he
shot
forward
at
a
pace
that
increased
with
every
second
at
the
back
of
his
mind
too
lay
some
kind
of
faint
perception
that
the
governess
would
after
all
be
there
to
help
him
she
had
always
turned
up
before
when
he
was
in
danger
and
she
would
not
fail
him
now
but
this
was
a
mere
ghost
of
a
thought
that
brought
little
comfort
and
merely
added
its
quota
of
force
to
the
speed
that
whipped
him
on
ever
faster
into
the
huge
white
in
front
for
this
then
he
had
escaped
from
the
horror
of
the
empty
house
to
be
sucked
up
into
the
moon
the
relentless
misty
moon
to
be
drawn
into
its
cruel
silver
web
and
destroyed
the
song
to
the
misty
moon
outside
the
window
came
back
in
snatches
and
added
to
his
terror
only
it
seemed
now
weeks
ago
since
he
had
heard
it
something
of
its
real
meaning
too
filtered
down
into
his
heart
and
he
trembled
anew
to
think
that
the
moon
could
be
a
great
vast
moving
being
alive
and
with
a
purpose
but
why
oh
why
did
they
keep
shouting
these
horrid
snatches
of
the
song
through
the
sky
trapped
trapped
the
word
haunted
him
through
the
night
thy
songs
are
nightly
driven
from
sky
to
sky
eternally
the
old
grey
hills
of
heaven
caught
at
last
the
moon
prisoner
a
captive
in
her
airless
caves
alone
on
her
dead
white
plains
searching
for
ever
in
vain
for
the
governess
wandering
alone
and
terrified
by
the
awful
grace
of
thy
weird
white
face
the
thought
crazed
him
and
he
struggled
like
a
bird
caught
in
a
net
but
he
might
as
well
have
struggled
to
push
the
worlds
out
of
their
courses
the
power
against
him
was
the
power
of
the
universe
in
which
he
was
nothing
but
a
little
lost
whirling
atom
it
was
all
of
no
avail
and
the
moon
did
not
even
smile
at
his
feeble
efforts
he
was
too
light
to
revolve
round
her
too
impalpable
to
create
his
own
orbit
he
had
not
even
the
consistency
of
a
comet
he
had
reached
the
point
of
stagnation
as
it
were
the
dead
level
the
neutral
zone
where
the
attractions
of
the
earth
and
moon
meet
and
counterbalance
one
another
where
bodies
have
no
weight
and
existence
no
meaning
now
the
moon
was
close
upon
him
he
could
see
nothing
else
there
lay
the
vast
shining
sea
of
light
in
front
of
him
behind
the
roar
of
the
following
creature
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
outdistanced
it
in
the
awful
swiftness
of
the
huge
drop
down
upon
the
moon
mountains
already
he
was
close
enough
to
its
surface
to
hear
nothing
of
its
great
singing
but
a
deep
confused
murmur
and
as
the
distance
increased
he
realised
that
the
change
in
his
own
condition
increased
he
felt
as
if
he
were
flying
off
into
a
million
tiny
particles
breaking
up
under
the
effects
of
the
deadly
speed
and
the
action
of
the
new
immense
invisible
arms
and
grew
out
of
the
white
disc
and
drew
him
downwards
upon
her
surface
he
was
being
merged
into
the
life
of
the
moon
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
his
wings
stopped
dead
their
vain
fluttering
was
all
but
over
hark
was
that
a
voice
borne
on
the
wings
of
some
lost
wind
why
should
his
heart
beat
so
tumultuously
all
at
once
he
turned
and
stared
into
the
ocean
of
black
air
overhead
till
it
turned
him
dizzy
a
violent
trembling
ran
through
his
tired
being
from
head
to
foot
he
had
heard
a
voice
a
voice
that
he
knew
and
loved
a
voice
of
help
and
deliverance
it
rang
in
shrill
syllables
up
the
empty
spaces
and
it
reached
new
centres
of
force
within
him
that
touched
his
last
store
of
courage
and
strength
jimbo
hold
on
it
cried
like
a
faint
thin
pricking
current
of
sound
almost
unable
to
reach
him
through
the
seas
of
distance
coming
hold
on
a
little
longer
it
was
the
governess
she
was
true
to
the
end
jimbo
felt
his
heart
swell
within
him
she
was
mounting
mounting
behind
him
with
incredible
swiftness
the
sound
of
his
own
name
in
these
terrible
regions
recalled
to
him
some
degree
of
concentration
and
he
strove
hard
to
fight
against
the
drawing
power
that
was
seeking
his
destruction
he
struggled
frantically
with
his
wings
but
between
him
and
the
governess
there
was
still
the
power
of
fright
to
be
overcome
the
very
power
she
had
long
ago
invoked
it
was
following
him
still
preventing
his
turning
back
and
driving
him
ever
forward
to
his
death
again
the
voice
sounded
in
the
night
and
this
time
it
was
closer
he
could
not
quite
distinguish
the
words
they
buzzed
oddly
in
his
ears
other
voices
mingled
with
them
the
hideous
children
began
to
shriek
somewhere
underneath
him
wings
with
eyes
among
their
burning
feathers
flashed
past
him
his
own
wings
folded
close
over
his
little
body
drooping
like
dead
things
his
eyes
closed
and
he
turned
on
his
side
a
huge
face
that
was
the
governess
and
the
other
half
the
head
gardener
at
home
thrust
itself
close
against
his
own
and
blew
upon
his
eyelids
till
he
opened
them
already
he
was
falling
sinking
tumbling
headlong
through
a
space
that
offered
no
resistance
jimbo
shrieked
a
voice
that
instantly
died
away
into
a
wail
behind
him
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
for
it
was
that
loved
voice
again
but
the
glare
from
the
moon
so
dazzled
him
that
he
could
only
fancy
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
governess
not
a
hundred
feet
away
struggling
and
floundering
in
the
clutch
of
a
black
creature
that
beat
the
air
with
enormous
wings
all
round
her
he
saw
her
hair
streaming
out
into
the
night
and
one
wing
seemed
to
hang
broken
and
useless
at
her
side
he
was
turning
over
and
over
like
a
piece
of
wood
in
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
the
governess
caught
by
fright
the
monster
of
her
own
creation
drifted
away
from
his
consciousness
as
a
dream
melts
away
in
the
light
of
the
morning
from
the
gleaming
mountains
and
treeless
plains
below
jimbo
thought
there
rose
a
hollow
roar
like
the
mocking
laughter
of
an
immense
multitude
of
people
shaking
with
mirth
the
moon
had
got
him
at
last
and
her
laughter
ran
through
the
heavens
like
a
wave
revolving
upon
his
own
little
axis
so
swiftly
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
more
he
dropped
straight
down
upon
the
great
satellite
the
light
of
the
moon
flamed
up
into
his
eyes
and
dazzled
him
but
what
in
the
world
was
this
how
could
the
moon
dwindle
so
suddenly
to
the
size
of
a
mere
lamp
flame
how
could
the
whole
expanse
of
the
heavens
shrink
in
an
instant
to
the
limits
of
a
little
cramped
room
in
a
single
second
before
he
had
time
to
realise
that
he
felt
surprise
the
entire
memory
of
his
recent
experiences
vanished
from
his
mind
the
past
became
an
utter
blank
like
a
wreath
of
smoke
everything
melted
away
as
if
it
had
never
been
at
all
the
functions
of
the
brain
resumed
their
normal
course
the
delirium
of
the
past
few
hours
was
over
jimbo
was
lying
at
home
on
his
bed
in
the
and
his
mother
was
bending
over
him
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
the
doctor
in
black
the
nurse
held
a
lamp
only
half
shaded
by
her
hand
as
she
approached
the
bedside
this
lamp
was
the
moon
of
his
delirium
only
he
had
quite
forgotten
now
that
there
had
ever
been
any
moon
at
all
the
little
thermometer
thrust
into
his
teeth
among
the
stars
was
still
in
his
mouth
a
bottle
made
his
feet
glow
and
burn
and
from
the
walls
of
the
came
as
it
were
the
echoes
of
sentences
take
his
temperature
give
him
the
medicine
the
moment
he
wakes
put
the
hot
bottle
to
his
feet
fetch
the
quick
where
am
i
mother
he
asked
in
a
whisper
you
in
bed
darling
and
must
keep
quite
quiet
you
soon
be
all
right
again
it
was
the
old
black
cow
that
tossed
you
the
gardener
found
you
by
the
swinging
gate
and
carried
you
in
you
been
unconscious
how
long
have
i
been
uncon
jimbo
could
not
manage
the
whole
word
about
three
hours
darling
then
he
fell
into
a
deep
dreamless
sleep
and
when
he
woke
long
after
it
was
early
morning
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
old
family
nurse
who
sat
watching
beside
the
bed
something
some
dim
memory
that
had
stirred
his
brain
in
sleep
immediately
rushed
to
his
lips
in
the
form
of
an
inconsequent
question
but
before
he
could
even
frame
the
sentence
the
thought
that
prompted
it
had
slipped
back
into
the
deeper
consciousness
he
had
just
left
behind
with
the
trance
of
deep
sleep
but
the
old
nurse
watching
every
movement
waiting
upon
the
very
breath
had
caught
the
question
and
she
answered
soothingly
in
a
whisper
oh
miss
lake
died
a
few
days
after
she
left
here
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
