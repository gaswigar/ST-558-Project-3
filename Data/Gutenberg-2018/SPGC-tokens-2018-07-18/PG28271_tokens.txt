seven
miles
to
arden
i
the
way
of
it
patsy
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
in
the
women
free
ward
of
the
city
hospital
she
was
pulling
on
a
vagabond
pair
of
gloves
while
she
mentally
gathered
up
a
somewhat
doubtful
ragged
lot
of
prospects
and
stood
them
in
a
row
before
her
for
contemplation
comparison
and
a
final
choice
they
strongly
resembled
the
contents
of
her
steamer
trunk
held
at
a
respectable
in
university
square
by
a
certain
miss
gibb
for
unpaid
board
for
these
were
made
up
of
a
jumble
of
priceless
and
worthless
belongings
unmarketable
because
of
their
extremes
she
had
time
for
contemplation
the
staff
wished
to
see
her
before
she
left
and
the
staff
at
that
moment
was
consulting
at
the
other
end
of
the
hospital
properly
speaking
patsy
was
patricia
but
no
one
had
ever
been
known
to
refer
to
her
in
that
manner
save
on
the
programs
of
the
irish
national
plays
and
in
the
city
register
what
the
city
hospital
knew
of
patsy
was
precisely
what
the
american
public
and
press
knew
what
the
national
players
knew
what
the
world
at
large
knew
precisely
what
patricia
had
chosen
to
tell
nothing
more
nothing
less
they
had
accepted
her
on
her
own
scanty
terms
and
believed
in
her
implicitly
there
was
one
thing
undeniably
true
about
her
her
reality
having
established
this
fact
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
like
her
and
trust
her
no
one
had
ever
thought
it
necessary
to
question
patsy
about
her
nationality
it
was
too
obvious
concerning
her
past
and
her
family
she
answered
every
one
alike
sure
i
was
born
without
either
i
was
found
by
accident
just
one
morning
hanging
on
to
the
thorn
of
a
killarney
that
happened
to
be
growing
by
the
brittany
coast
they
say
i
was
found
by
the
physician
to
the
king
who
was
traveling
past
and
that
how
it
comes
i
can
speak
french
and
english
equally
pure
although
i
not
denying
i
prefer
them
both
with
a
bit
of
brogue
she
always
thought
in
irish
straight
donegal
irish
with
a
dropping
of
final
g
a
bur
to
the
r
and
a
ye
for
a
you
invariably
this
was
her
manner
of
speech
with
those
she
loved
or
toward
whom
she
felt
the
kinship
of
sympathetic
understanding
to
those
who
pushed
their
inquisitiveness
about
ancestry
to
the
patsy
blinked
a
pair
of
eyes
while
she
wrinkled
her
forehead
into
a
speculative
frown
faith
i
can
hearken
back
to
adam
the
same
as
yourselves
but
if
it
some
one
more
modern
you
asking
for
there
that
rascal
dan
he
too
long
dead
to
deny
any
claim
i
might
put
on
him
so
devil
a
word
will
i
be
saying
only
if
ye
should
find
by
chance
any
time
that
i
rather
fight
with
my
wits
than
my
fists
ye
can
lay
that
to
dan
door
along
with
the
stubbornness
of
a
tinker
ass
people
had
been
known
to
pry
into
her
religion
and
on
these
patsy
smiled
indulgently
as
one
does
sometimes
on
overcurious
children
sure
i
believe
in
every
one
and
as
for
a
church
there
not
a
place
that
goes
by
the
name
synagogue
or
cathedral
that
i
ca
be
finding
a
wee
bit
of
god
waiting
inside
for
me
but
i
own
to
it
honestly
that
when
i
out
seeking
him
i
find
him
easiest
on
some
hilltop
with
the
wind
blowing
hard
from
the
sea
and
never
a
human
soul
in
sight
this
was
approximately
all
the
world
and
the
press
knew
of
patsy
barring
the
fact
that
she
was
neighboring
in
the
twenties
was
fresh
unspoiled
and
charming
and
that
she
had
played
the
ingénue
parts
with
the
national
players
revealing
an
art
that
promised
a
good
future
should
luck
bring
the
chance
unfortunately
this
chance
was
not
numbered
among
the
prospects
patsy
reviewed
from
the
edge
of
her
hospital
cot
that
day
the
interest
of
the
press
and
the
public
approval
of
the
national
irish
players
had
not
proved
sufficient
to
propitiate
that
monster
financial
success
the
company
went
into
bankruptcy
before
they
had
played
half
their
bookings
their
final
curtain
went
down
on
a
bit
of
drama
staged
impromptu
on
a
north
river
dock
with
barely
enough
cash
in
hand
to
pay
the
company
home
passage
on
this
occasion
patsy
had
missed
her
cue
for
the
first
time
she
had
been
left
in
the
wings
so
to
speak
and
that
night
she
filled
the
only
vacant
bed
in
the
women
free
ward
of
the
city
hospital
it
was
pneumonia
patsy
had
tossed
about
and
moaned
with
the
racking
pain
of
it
raving
deliriously
through
her
score
or
more
of
rôles
she
had
gone
dancing
off
with
the
faery
child
to
the
land
of
desire
she
had
sat
beside
the
bier
in
the
riders
to
the
sea
she
had
laughed
through
the
full
o
moon
and
played
the
fool
while
the
wise
man
died
the
nurses
and
doctors
had
listened
with
wonder
and
secret
enjoyment
she
had
allowed
them
to
peep
into
a
new
world
too
full
of
charm
and
lure
to
be
denied
and
then
of
a
sudden
she
had
settled
down
to
a
silent
grim
tussle
with
the
gray
brother
this
was
all
weeks
past
it
was
early
june
now
the
theatrical
season
was
closed
for
two
months
with
no
prospects
in
the
booking
agencies
until
august
in
the
mean
time
she
had
eight
dollars
cents
and
a
crooked
sixpence
as
available
collateral
and
an
unpaid
board
bill
patsy
felt
sorry
for
miss
gibb
but
she
felt
no
shame
keepers
dressmakers
bootmakers
and
the
like
must
take
the
risk
along
with
the
players
themselves
in
the
matter
of
getting
paid
for
their
services
if
the
public
who
paid
two
dollars
a
seat
for
a
performance
failed
to
appear
and
receipts
failed
to
margin
their
salaries
it
was
their
misfortune
not
their
fault
and
others
had
to
suffer
along
with
them
but
these
debts
of
circumstance
never
troubled
patsy
she
paid
them
when
she
could
and
when
she
could
not
there
was
always
her
trunk
the
city
hospital
happened
to
know
the
extent
of
patsy
property
it
is
their
business
to
find
out
these
little
private
matters
concerning
their
free
patients
they
had
also
drawn
certain
conclusions
from
the
facts
that
no
one
had
come
to
see
patsy
and
that
no
communications
had
reached
her
from
anywhere
it
looked
to
them
as
if
patsy
were
down
and
out
to
state
it
baldly
now
the
patsys
that
come
to
free
wards
of
city
hospitals
are
very
rare
and
the
superintendent
and
staff
and
nurses
were
interested
beyond
the
usual
limits
set
by
their
time
and
work
and
the
professional
hardening
of
their
cardiac
region
she
not
to
leave
here
until
we
find
out
just
who
she
got
to
look
after
her
until
she
gets
on
her
feet
again
understand
and
the
old
doctor
tapped
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
his
right
forefinger
a
sign
of
important
emphasis
therefore
the
day
nurse
had
gone
to
summon
the
staff
while
patsy
still
sat
obediently
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
pulling
on
her
vagabond
gloves
reviewing
her
prospects
and
waiting
my
but
we
miss
you
came
the
voice
from
the
woman
in
the
next
bed
who
had
been
watching
her
regretfully
for
some
time
it
my
noise
ye
be
missing
and
patsy
smiled
back
at
her
a
winning
comrade
sort
of
smile
you
kind
o
got
us
all
acquainted
with
one
another
and
about
somethin
else
but
pains
and
troubles
it
seem
awful
lonesome
with
you
gone
and
the
woman
beyond
heaved
a
prodigious
sigh
do
ye
believe
it
said
patsy
with
conviction
they
be
fetching
in
some
one
a
good
bit
better
to
fill
my
place
ye
see
just
no
they
wo
be
another
dago
likely
whist
patsy
raised
a
silencing
finger
and
looked
fearsomely
over
her
shoulder
to
the
bed
back
of
her
its
inmate
lay
covered
to
the
cheek
but
one
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
tangled
black
hair
and
a
swarthy
skin
patsy
rose
and
went
softly
over
to
the
bed
her
movement
disturbed
the
woman
who
opened
dumb
reproachful
eyes
i
be
gone
in
a
minute
dear
i
want
just
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
but
sure
mother
mary
has
it
safe
and
she
keeping
it
for
ye
she
stooped
and
brushed
the
forehead
with
her
lips
as
the
staff
and
two
of
the
nurses
appeared
faith
is
it
a
delegation
or
a
constabulary
and
patsy
laughed
the
laugh
that
had
made
her
famous
from
dublin
to
duluth
where
the
bankruptcy
had
occurred
it
a
committee
to
find
out
just
where
you
going
after
you
leave
here
said
the
young
doctor
patsy
eyed
him
quizzically
that
not
manners
to
ask
personal
questions
but
i
do
mind
telling
ye
all
confidentially
that
i
have
my
mind
made
yet
between
a
reception
at
the
vincent
wanderlusts
or
a
musicale
at
the
look
here
lassie
the
old
doctor
ruffled
his
beard
and
threw
out
his
chest
like
a
mammoth
pouter
pigeon
you
have
to
give
us
a
sensible
answer
before
we
let
you
go
one
step
you
know
you
expect
to
get
very
far
with
that
in
this
city
and
he
tapped
the
bag
on
her
wrist
significantly
patsy
flushed
crimson
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
her
knowledge
the
world
had
discovered
more
about
her
than
she
had
intended
those
humiliating
eight
dollars
cents
and
the
crooked
sixpence
seemed
to
be
scorching
their
way
through
the
leather
that
held
them
but
she
met
the
eyes
looking
into
hers
with
a
flinty
resistance
sure
carry
me
a
long
way
i
thinking
if
i
spent
it
by
the
bit
then
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
if
ye
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
parcel
of
old
mother
hens
that
have
just
hatched
out
a
brood
o
wild
turkeys
she
suddenly
checked
her
irish
it
was
apt
to
lead
her
into
compromising
situations
with
folk
if
she
did
not
leash
her
tongue
and
slid
into
english
you
see
i
really
know
quite
a
number
of
people
here
rather
well
too
why
have
they
come
to
see
you
then
asked
the
day
nurse
bluntly
patsy
eyed
her
with
admiration
you
never
make
a
press
agent
or
a
doctor
i
afraid
you
too
truthful
you
see
explained
the
old
doctor
these
friends
of
yours
are
what
we
professional
people
term
hypothetical
cases
we
like
to
be
sure
of
something
real
one
of
patsy
vagabond
gloves
closed
over
the
doctor
hand
bless
you
all
for
your
goodness
but
the
people
are
more
real
than
you
think
everybody
believes
i
went
back
with
the
company
and
i
never
bothered
them
with
the
truth
you
see
i
more
than
one
good
friend
among
the
theatrical
crowd
right
here
but
well
you
know
how
it
is
if
you
are
a
bit
down
on
your
luck
you
keep
away
from
your
own
world
if
you
can
there
is
a
girl
just
about
my
own
age
in
society
here
we
did
a
lot
for
her
in
the
way
of
giving
her
a
good
time
when
she
was
in
dublin
and
i
seen
her
quite
a
bit
over
here
i
going
to
her
to
get
something
to
do
before
the
season
begins
she
may
need
a
secretary
or
a
governess
or
a
cook
holy
saint
martin
but
i
can
cook
and
patsy
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstatic
appreciation
of
her
culinary
art
it
was
the
only
one
of
which
she
was
boastful
i
tell
you
what
said
the
old
doctor
gruffly
we
will
let
you
go
if
you
will
promise
to
come
back
if
if
no
one
at
home
against
rules
but
i
see
the
superintendent
keeps
your
bed
for
you
thank
you
said
patsy
she
waved
a
farewell
to
the
staff
and
the
ward
as
she
went
through
the
door
i
do
know
where
i
going
or
what
i
shall
be
finding
but
if
it
anything
worth
sharing
i
send
some
back
to
you
all
the
staff
watched
her
down
the
corridor
to
the
elevator
gee
exclaimed
the
youngest
doctor
his
admiration
working
out
to
the
surface
when
she
made
her
name
i
going
to
marry
her
oh
are
you
the
voice
of
the
old
doctor
took
on
its
habitual
tartness
acute
touch
of
philanthropy
what
eh
patricia
swung
the
hospital
door
behind
her
and
stepped
out
into
a
blaze
of
june
sunshine
holy
saint
patrick
but
it
feels
good
now
if
i
could
be
an
alley

for
two
months
i
could
get
along
fine
she
cast
a
backward
look
toward
the
granite
front
of
the
city
hospital
and
her
eyes
grew
as
blue
and
soft
as

full
of

and
the
world
knew
more
than
these
things
concerning
marjorie
schuyler
it
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
of
regal
bearing
and
distinguished
manner
an
aunt
lived
with
her
to
lend
dignity
and
chaperonage
to
her
position
but
she
managed
her
own
affairs
social
and
financial
for
herself
if
the
world
had
been
asked
to
choose
a
modern
prototype
for
the
young
independent
american
girl
of
the
leisure
class
it
is
reasonably
safe
to
assume
it
would
have
named
marjorie
schuyler
as
for
young
burgeman
the
world
knew
him
as
the
rich
man
son
that
was
the
best
and
worst
it
could
say
of
him
i
think
toto
said
marjorie
schuyler
to
her
toy
ruby
spaniel
it
will
be
june
there
is
only
one
thing
you
can
do
with
october
a
church
wedding
chrysanthemums
and
oak
leaves
but
june
offers
so
many
possible
variations
besides
that
gives
us
both
one
last
untrammeled
season
in
town
yes
june
it
is
and
we
not
have
to
think
about
these
yet
awhile
whereupon
she
dropped
the
shimmering
samples
into
the
a
maid
pushed
aside
the
hangings
that
curtained
her
den
from
the
great
schuyler
library
there
a
young
person
giving
the
name
of
asking
to
see
you
shall
i
say
you
are
out
marjorie
schuyler
raised
a
pair
of
interrogatory
eyebrows
why
it
ca
be
the
entire
company
went
back
weeks
ago
what
is
she
like
small
and
brown
with
very
pink
cheeks
and
very
blue
eyes
the
maid
nodded
ambiguously
bring
her
up
i
know
it
ca
be
but
but
it
was
the
next
moment
marjorie
schuyler
was
taking
a
firm
grip
of
patsy
shoulders
while
she
looked
down
with
mock
disapproval
at
the
girl
who
reached
barely
to
her
shoulder
patsy
why
did
you
go
home
with
the
others
and
what
have
you
done
to
your
cheeks
patsy
attacked
them
with
two
merciless
fists
sure
they
after
needing
a
pinch
of
wind
that
all
yourself
marjorie
schuyler
pushed
her
gently
into
a
great
chair
while
she
herself
took
a
carved
baronial
seat
opposite
the
nearness
of
anything
so
exquisitely
perfect
as
marjorie
schuyler
and
the
comparison
it
was
bound
to
suggest
would
have
been
a
conscious
ordeal
for
almost
any
other
girl
but
patsy
was
oblivious
of
the
comparison
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
she
looked
like
a
neighboring
with
a
bird
of
paradise
her
brown
norfolk
suit
was
a
shabby
affair
positively
clamoring
for
a
successor
the
boyish
brown
beaver
lacking
feather
or
flower
was
pulled
down
rakishly
over
her
mass
of
brown
curls
and
the
vagabond
gloves
gave
a
consistent
finish
to
the
picture
and
yet
there
was
that
about
patsy
which
defied
comparison
even
with
marjorie
schuyler
moreover
a
thrush
sings
now
tell
me
said
marjorie
schuyler
where
have
you
been
all
these
weeks
patsy
considered
well
i
been
taking
up
hospital
training
oh
how
splendid
are
you
going
over
with
the
new
red
cross
supply
patsy
shook
her
head
you
see
they
only
kept
me
until
they
had
demonstrated
all
they
knew
about
lung
disorders
and
treatment
and
then
they
dismissed
me
i
fearsome
they
were
after
finding
out
i
had
the
making
of
a
nurse
that
too
bad
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
an
amused
little
smile
twitched
at
the
corners
of
patsy
mouth
it
acted
as
if
it
wanted
to
run
loose
all
over
her
face
sure
i
have
my
mind
made
quite
and
yourself
oh
i
marjorie
schuyler
leaned
forward
a
trifle
did
you
know
i
was
engaged
betrothed
holy
saint
bridget
bless
ye
and
the
vagabond
gloves
clasped
the
slender
hands
of
the
american
prototype
and
gave
them
a
hard
little
squeeze
who
himself
it
billy
burgeman
son
of
burgeman
old
king
midas
that
a
new
name
for
him
it
has
fitted
him
years
enough
patsy
face
sobered
oh
why
does
money
always
have
to
mate
with
money
why
could
you
have
married
a
poor
great
man
a
poet
a
painter
a
thinker
a
dreamer
some
one
who
ought
not
to
be
bound
down
by
his
heels
to
the
earth
for
or
you
could
have
cut
the
thongs
and
sent
him
soaring
given
the
world
another
unbound
as
for
billy
burgeman
he
could
have
married
me
and
patsy
spread
her
hands
in
mock
petition
marjorie
schuyler
laughed
you
that
is
too
beautifully
delicious
why
patsy
william
burgeman
is
the
most
conventional
young
gentleman
i
have
ever
met
in
my
life
you
would
shock
him
into
a
condition
in
an
afternoon
and
pray
what
would
you
do
with
him
sure
i
make
a
man
of
him
that
what
his
father
son
might
need
it
i
thinking
marjorie
schuyler
face
became
perfectly
blank
for
a
second
then
she
leaned
against
the
baronial
arms
on
the
back
of
her
seat
tilted
her
head
and
mused
aloud
i
wonder
just
what
billy
burgeman
does
lack
sometimes
i
wondered
if
it
was
not
having
a
mother
or
growing
up
without
brothers
or
sisters
or
living
all
alone
with
his
father
in
that
great
gloomy
house
it
is
not
a
lack
of
manhood
i
sure
of
that
and
it
not
lack
of
caring
for
he
can
care
a
lot
about
some
things
but
what
is
it
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
know
if
the
tales
about
old
king
midas
have
a
thruppence
worth
of
truth
in
them
it
might
be
his
father
meanness
that
ailing
him
marjorie
schuyler
shook
her
head
no
billy
almost
a
prodigal
his
father
says
he
has
the
slightest
idea
of
the
value
of
money
just
so
much
beans
or
shells
or
knives
or
trading
pelf
with
him
something
to
exchange
for
what
he
calls
the
real
things
of
life
why
when
he
was
a
boy
in
fact
until
he
was
almost
grown
his
father
could
trust
billy
with
a
cent
who
said
that
billy
or
the
king
his
father
of
course
that
why
he
has
never
taken
billy
into
business
with
him
he
is
making
billy
win
his
spurs
on
his
own
merits
and
he
not
going
to
let
him
into
the
firm
until
he
worth
at
least
five
thousand
a
year
to
some
other
firm
oh
burgeman
has
excellent
ideas
about
bringing
up
a
son
billy
ought
to
amount
to
a
great
deal
meaning
money
or
character
inquired
patsy
marjorie
schuyler
looked
at
her
sharply
are
you
laughing
faith
i
closer
to
weeping
be
a
lonesome
hard
rearing
that
would
come
to
a
son
of
king
midas
i
thinking
i
far
rather
be
the
son
of
his
gooseherd
if
i
had
the
choosing
she
leaned
forward
impulsively
and
gathered
up
the
hands
of
the
girl
opposite
in
the
warm
friendly
compass
of
those
vagabond
gloves
do
ye
really
love
him
and
this
time
it
was
her
look
that
was
sharp
why
of
course
i
love
him
what
a
foolish
question
why
should
i
be
marrying
him
if
i
did
love
him
why
do
you
ask
because
the
son
of
king
midas
with
no
mother
with
no
one
at
all
but
the
king
growing
up
all
alone
in
a
gloomy
old
castle
with
no
one
trusting
him
would
need
a
great
deal
of
love
a
great
great
deal
that
all
right
ellen
i
find
her
for
myself
it
was
a
voice
pitched
overhigh
it
came
from
somewhere
beyond
and
below
the
inclosing
curtains
and
cut
off
the
last
of
patsy
speech
that
funny
said
marjorie
schuyler
rising
there
billy
now
i
bring
him
in
and
let
you
see
for
yourself
that
he
not
at
all
an
object
of
sympathy
or
pity
she
disappeared
into
the
library
leaving
patsy
speculating
recklessly
they
must
have
met
just
the
other
side
of
the
closed
hangings
for
to
patsy
their
voices
sounded
very
near
and
close
together
hello
billy
listen
marjorie
if
a
girl
loves
a
man
she
ought
to
be
willing
to
trust
him
over
a
dreadful
bungle
until
he
could
straighten
things
out
and
make
good
again
that
true
is
it
billy
burgeman
what
do
you
mean
just
answer
my
question
if
a
girl
loves
a
man
she
trust
him
wo
she
i
suppose
so
you
know
she
would
dear
what
would
the
man
do
if
she
did
the
voice
sounded
strained
and
unnatural
in
its
intensity
and
appeal
patsy
rose
troubled
in
mind
and
tiptoed
to
the
only
other
door
in
the
den
is
a
grand
situation
for
a
play
she
remarked
dryly
but
is
a
mortial
poor
one
in
real
life
and
i
best
out
of
it
she
turned
the
knob
with
eager
fingers
and
pulled
the
door
toward
her
it
opened
on
a
dumbwaiter
shaft
empty
and
impressive
patsy
expression
would
have
scored
a
hit
in
farce
comedy
unfortunately
there
was
no
audience
present
to
appreciate
it
here
and
the
prompter
forgot
to
ring
down
the
curtain
just
then
so
that
patsy
stood
helpless
forced
to
go
on
hearing
all
that
marjorie
and
her
leading
man
wished
to
improvise
in
the
way
of
lines
i
told
you
patsy
was
tempted
to
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
what
he
was
saying
but
she
knew
even
then
she
would
go
on
hearing
his
voice
was
too
vibrant
too
insistent
to
be
shut
out
my
father
name
for
ten
thousand
i
took
the
check
to
the
bank
myself
and
cashed
it
father
of
course
the
cashier
knew
me
i
tell
you
i
ca
explain
not
now
i
got
to
get
away
and
stay
away
until
i
squared
the
thing
and
paid
father
back
billy
burgeman
did
you
forge
that
check
yourself
what
does
that
matter
whether
i
forged
it
or
had
it
forged
or
saw
it
forged
i
tell
you
i
cashed
it
knowing
it
was
forged
do
you
understand
yes
but
if
you
did
forge
it
you
could
easily
prove
it
people
would
have
to
know
the
rest
they
are
hushing
up
things
of
that
kind
every
day
a
silence
dropped
on
the
three
like
a
choking
blinding
fog
the
two
outside
the
hangings
must
have
been
staring
at
each
other
too
bewildered
or
shocked
to
speak
the
one
inside
clutched
her
throat
muttering
if
my
heart
keeps
up
this
thumping
faith
he
think
it
the
police
and
run
at
last
the
voice
of
the
man
came
hushed
but
strained
almost
to
breaking
to
patsy
it
sounded
as
if
he
were
staking
his
very
soul
in
the
words
uncertain
of
the
balance
marjorie
you
do
understand
i
cashed
that
check
because
because
i
want
to
take
the
responsibility
of
it
and
whatever
penalty
comes
along
with
it
i
do
believe
father
will
ever
tell
he
too
proud
it
would
strike
back
at
him
too
hard
but
you
would
have
to
know
he
tell
you
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
first
myself
i
want
to
go
away
knowing
you
believe
and
trust
me
no
matter
what
father
says
about
me
no
matter
what
every
one
thinks
about
me
i
want
to
hear
you
say
it
that
you
will
be
waiting
just
like
this
for
me
to
come
back
to
when
squared
it
all
off
and
can
explain
why
marjorie
marjorie
patsy
waited
in
an
agony
of
dread
hope
prayer
waited
for
the
answer
she
the
girl
he
loved
would
make
it
came
at
last
slowly
deliberately
as
if
spoken
impersonally
by
the
foreman
of
a
jury
i
do
believe
in
you
billy
i
sorry
but
i
do
believe
i
could
ever
trust
you
again
your
father
has
always
said
you
take
care
of
money
this
simply
means
you
have
got
yourself
into
some
wretched
hole
and
forging
your
father
name
was
the
only
way
out
of
it
i
suppose
you
think
the
circumstances
whatever
they
may
be
have
warranted
the
act
but
that
act
puts
a
stigma
on
your
name
which
makes
it
unfit
for
any
woman
to
bear
and
if
you
have
any
spark
of
manhood
left
you
unwish
the
wish
you
will
unthink
the
thought
that
i
would
wait
or
even
want
you
ever
to
come
back
a
cry
a
startled
frightened
cry
rang
through
the
rooms
it
did
not
come
from
either
marjorie
or
her
leading
man
patsy
stood
with
a
vagabond
glove
pressed
hard
over
her
mouth
quite
unconscious
that
the
cry
had
escaped
and
that
there
was
no
longer
need
of
muzzling
then
plunged
headlong
through
the
hangings
into
the
library
marjorie
schuyler
was
standing
alone
where
is
he
your
man
he
gone
and
please
do
call
him
that
go
after
him
hurry
do
let
him
go
do
ye
understand
he
must
go
away
with
no
one
believing
in
him
tell
him
it
a
mistake
tell
him
anything
only
go
while
patsy
tongue
burred
out
its
irish
brogue
she
pushed
at
the
tall
figure
in
front
of
her
pushed
with
all
her
might
are
ye
nailed
to
the
floor
what
happened
to
your
feet
for
heaven
sake
lift
them
and
let
them
take
ye
after
him
do
ye
hear
there
the
front
door
slamming
behind
him
he
be
gone
past
your
calling
in
another
minute
dear
heart
alive
ye
ca
be
meaning
to
let
him
go
this
way
but
marjorie
schuyler
stood
immovable
and
deaf
to
her
pleading
incredulity
bewilderment
pity
and
despair
swept
over
patsy
face
like
clouds
scudding
over
the
surface
of
a
clear
lake
then
scorn
settled
in
her
eyes
i
sorry
for
ye
sorry
for
any
woman
that
fails
the
man
who
loves
her
i
do
know
this
son
of
old
king
midas
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
and
all
i
know
about
him
is
what
ye
told
me
this
day
and
scraps
of
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
but
i
believe
in
him
i
know
he
never
forged
that
check
or
used
the
money
for
any
mean
use
of
his
own
i
wager
he
shielding
some
one
some
one
weaker
than
he
too
afeared
to
step
up
and
say
so
why
i
trust
him
across
the
world
and
back
again
and
holy
saint
patrick
i
going
after
him
to
tell
him
so
for
the
second
time
within
a
few
seconds
marjorie
schuyler
listened
and
heard
the
front
door
slam
then
the
goddess
came
to
life
she
walked
slowly
regally
across
the
library
and
passed
between
the
hangings
which
curtained
her
den
her
eyes
probably
by
pure
chance
glanced
over
the
shimmering
contents
of
the
a
little
cold
smile
crept
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
while
her
chin
stiffened
i
think
toto
she
said
addressing
the
toy
ruby
spaniel
that
it
will
not
be
even
a
june
wedding
and
she
laughed
a
crisp
dry
little
laugh
iii
patsy
plays
a
part
patsy
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
schuyler
house
jumping
the
last
four
as
her
feet
struck
the
pavement
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
what
she
sought
there
it
was
the
back
of
a
man
in
a
balmacaan
coat
of
scotch
tweed
and
a
round
plush
hat
turning
the
corner
to
madison
avenue
patsy
groaned
inwardly
when
she
saw
the
outlines
of
the
figure
they
were
so
conventional
so
disappointing
they
lacked
simplicity
and
directness
two
salient
life
principles
with
patsy
pshaw
what
in
a
back
muttered
patsy
he
may
be
a
man
for
all
his
clothes
and
she
took
to
her
heels
after
him
as
she
reached
the
corner
he
jumped
on
a
passing
car
going
south
tracking
for
the
railroad
station
was
her
mental
comment
and
she
looked
north
for
the
next
car
following
there
was
none
as
far
as
eye
could
see
there
was
an
unbroken
stretch
of
track
fate
seemed
strangely
averse
to
aiding
and
abetting
her
deed
when
in
doubt
take
a
taxi
suggested
patsy
inner
consciousness
and
she
accepted
the
advice
without
argument
she
raced
down
two
blocks
and
found
one
grand
central
and
drive
like
the
devil
as
the
door
clicked
behind
her
her
eye
caught
the
jumping
indicator
and
she
smiled
a
grim
smile
faith
in
jumps
like
that
i
be
bankrupt
afore
i
my
hand
on
the
tails
of
that
coat
and
with
a
tired
little
sigh
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
closed
her
eyes
and
relaxed
her
grip
on
mind
and
will
and
body
a
series
of
jerks
and
a
final
stop
shook
her
into
a
thinking
acting
consciousness
again
she
was
out
of
the
taxi
in
a
twinkling
with
the
man
paid
and
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
a
balmacaan
coat
and
plush
hat
disappearing
through
a
doorway
she
could
not
follow
it
as
fast
as
she
had
reckoned
she
balanced
corners
with
a
stout
indeterminate
old
gentleman
who
blocked
her
way
and
insisted
on
wavering
in
her
direction
each
time
she
tried
to
dodge
him
in
her
haste
to
make
up
for
those
precious
lost
seconds
she
upset
a
pair
of
twins
belonging
to
an
already
overburdened
mother
these
she
righted
and
went
dashing
on
her
way
groups
waylaid
her
people
with
time
to
kill
sauntered
in
front
of
her
wandering
indecisive
people
tried
to
stop
her
for
information
and
she
reached
the
gate
just
as
it
was
closing
through
it
she
could
see
down
a
discouraging
length
of
platform
a
balmacaaned
figure
disappearing
into
a
car
too
late
lady
train
leaving
it
was
well
for
patsy
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
law
governing
closing
gates
and
departing
trains
for
the
foolish
and
the
ignorant
can
sometimes
achieve
the
impossible
she
confronted
the
guard
with
a
look
of
unconquerable
determination
no
is
the
train
guard
is
still
on
the
platform
you
got
to
let
me
through
she
emphasized
the
importance
of
it
with
two
tight
fists
placed
not
overgently
in
the
center
of
the
guard
rotundity
and
accompanied
by
a
shove
in
some
miraculous
fashion
this
accomplished
it
the
gate
clanged
at
patsy
back
instead
of
in
her
face
as
she
had
expected
a
bell
rang
a
whistle
tooted
and
patsy
feet
clattered
like
mad
down
the
platform
a
brakeman
picked
her
up
and
lifted
her
to
the
rear
platform
of
the
last
car
as
it
drew
out
that
saved
the
day
for
patsy
for
her
strength
and
breath
had
gone
past
summoning
thank
you
she
said
feebly
with
a
vagabond
glove
held
out
in
proffered
fellowship
that
the
kindest
thing
any
one
has
done
for
me
since
i
came
over
are
ye
irish
same
as
yourself
how
did
ye
know
sure
who
but
an
irishman
would
have
had
his
wits
and
his
heart
working
at
the
same
time
and
with
a
laugh
patsy
left
him
and
went
inside
her
eye
ran
systematically
down
the
rows
of
seats
billy
burgeman
was
not
there
she
passed
through
to
the
next
car
and
a
second
and
a
third
still
there
was
no
back
she
could
identify
as
belonging
to
the
man
she
was
pursuing
she
was
crossing
a
fourth
platform
when
she
ran
into
the
conductor
who
barred
her
way
ahead
lady
this
is
the
last
of
the
patsy
had
it
on
the
end
of
her
tongue
to
say
she
preferred
intending
to
duck
simultaneously
under
the
arm
and
enter
but
the
words
rolled
no
farther
than
the
tongue
edge
she
turned
obediently
back
the
car
and
taking
the
first
seat
by
the
door
for
this
her
memory
was
responsible
it
had
spun
the
day
events
before
her
like
a
roulette
wheel
stopping
precisely
at
the
remark
of
marjorie
concerning
william
burgeman
he
the
most
conventional
young
gentleman
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
why
you
would
shock
a
strange
young
woman
doling
out
consolation
to
him
in
a
would
be
anything
but
a
dramatic
success
patsy
felt
this
all
too
keenly
he
was
decidedly
not
of
her
world
or
the
men
and
women
she
knew
who
gave
help
when
the
need
came
regardless
of
time
place
acquaintanceship
or
sex
faith
he
the
kind
that
will
expect
an
introduction
first
and
a
month
or
two
of
tangoing
and
after
which
if
i
ask
his
permission
he
might
consider
it
proper
patsy
groaned
oh
i
hate
the
man
already
ticket
ticket
what
for
what
for
do
you
think
this
is
a
joy
ride
the
conductor
radiated
sarcasm
patsy
crimsoned
i
have
mine
i
i
was
to
meet
my
aunt
who
had
the
ticket
and
she
must
have
missed
the
train
where
are
you
going
i
i
why
i
was
telling
my
aunt
had
the
tickets
how
would
i
know
where
i
was
going
without
the
tickets
the
conductor
snorted
patsy
looked
hard
at
him
and
knew
the
time
had
come
for
wits
good
sharp
wits
she
smiled
coaxingly
it
sounds
so
stupid
but
you
see
i
have
an
idea
where
i
am
going
i
was
to
meet
my
aunt
and
go
down
with
her
to
her
summer
place
i
i
ca
remember
the
name
her
mouth
drooped
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
she
brightened
all
over
i
know
what
i
can
do
very
probably
she
missed
the
train
because
she
expects
to
be
at
the
station
to
meet
me
i
can
look
out
each
time
the
train
stops
and
when
i
see
her
i
can
get
off
that
makes
it
all
right
does
it
and
she
smiled
in
open
confidence
as
a
sacrificial
maiden
might
have
propitiated
the
dragon
but
it
was
not
reciprocated
he
eyed
her
scornfully
and
who
pays
for
the
ticket
oh
patsy
caught
her
breath
then
she
sent
it
bubbling
forth
in
a
contagious
laugh
i
do
of
course
i
take
a
ticket
to
just
name
over
the
stations
please
the
conductor
growled
them
forth
hampden
forestview
hainsville
dartmouth
hudson
arden
brambleside
mayberry
greyfriars
what
that
last
greyfriars
i
take
a
ticket
to
greyfriars
she
said
it
after
the
same
fashion
she
might
have
used
in
ordering
a
mutton
chop
at
a
restaurant
and
handed
the
conductor
a
bill
when
he
had
given
her
the
change
and
passed
on
still
disgruntled
patsy
allowed
herself
what
she
called
a
temporary
attack
of
private
prostration
idiot
she
groaned
in
ye
are
the
biggest
fool
in
two
continents
and
the
lord
knows
what
dan
would
be
thinking
of
ye
if
he
were
topside
o
green
earth
to
hear
whereupon
she
gripped
one
vagabond
glove
with
the
other
in
fellow
misery
and
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
her
eyes
closed
with
sheer
exhaustion
the
train
rumbled
on
each
time
it
stopped
patsy
watched
the
doorway
and
the
window
beside
her
for
sight
of
her
quarry
each
time
it
started
again
she
sighed
inwardly
with
relief
glad
of
another
furlough
from
a
mission
which
was
fast
growing
appalling
she
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
interested
in
billy
burgeman
as
an
individual
he
had
shrunk
into
an
abstract
sense
of
duty
and
as
such
failed
to
appeal
or
convince
but
as
her
interest
waned
her
determination
waxed
she
would
get
him
and
tell
him
what
she
had
come
for
if
it
took
a
year
and
a
day
and
shocked
him
into
complete
oblivion
she
was
saying
this
to
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
adding
for
spice
and
artistic
finish
after
that
the
devil
take
him
when
the
train
pulled
away
from
another
station
she
had
already
satisfied
herself
that
he
was
not
among
the
leaving
passengers
but
suddenly
something
familiar
in
a
solitary
figure
standing
at
the
far
end
of
the
gravel
embankment
caught
her
eye
it
was
back
toward
her
and
in
the
quick
passing
and
the
gathering
dusk
she
could
make
out
dim
outlines
only
but
those
outlines
were
unmistakable
unforgetable
a
million
curses
on
the
house
of
burgeman
quoth
patsy
well
there
naught
for
it
but
to
get
off
at
the
next
station
and
go
back
the
conductor
watched
her
get
off
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
relief
he
had
very
much
feared
she
was
not
a
responsible
person
and
in
no
mental
position
to
be
traveling
alone
her
departure
cleared
him
of
all
uneasiness
and
obligation
and
he
settled
down
to
his
business
with
an
unburdened
mind
not
so
patsy
she
blinked
at
the
vanishing
train
and
then
at
her
empty
hands
with
the
nearest
she
had
ever
come
in
her
life
to
utter
abject
despair
she
had
left
her
bag
in
the
car
when
articulate
thinking
was
possible
she
remarked
acridly
ye
need
a
baby
nurse
to
mind
ye
patricia
and
i
not
sure
but
ye
need
a
perambulator
as
well
she
gave
a
tired
little
stretch
to
her
body
and
rubbed
her
eyes
i
feel
as
if
this
was
all
a
silly
play
and
i
was
cast
for
the
part
of
an
irish
simpleton
a
burlesque
that
ye
swear
never
happened
in
real
life
outside
of
the
county
asylums
a
headlight
raced
down
the
track
toward
her
and
the
city
and
she
gathered
up
what
was
left
of
her
scattered
wits
as
the
train
slowed
up
she
stepped
into
the
shadows
and
her
eye
fell
on
the
open
she
smiled
grimly
faith
i
have
a
notion
i
like
brakemen
and
baggagemen
better
than
conductors
and
so
it
came
to
pass
as
the
train
started
that
the
baggageman
who
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
doorway
was
somewhat
startled
to
see
a
small
figure
come
racing
toward
it
out
of
the
dusk
and
land
sprawling
on
the
floor
beside
him
a
girl
tramp
he
ejaculated
in
amazement
and
disgust
and
then
as
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
do
you
know
you
breaking
the
law
she
laughed
from
the
feelings
i
thought
it
was
something
else
she
sobered
and
turned
on
him
fiercely
i
want
ye
to
understand
paid
my
fare
on
the
train
out
which
entitled
me
to
one
continuous
passage
my
well
i
returning
my
take
up
no
more
room
and
i
ask
no
more
privileges
that
may
sound
sensible
but
it
not
law
and
the
man
grinned
broadly
i
sorry
miss
but
off
you
go
at
the
next
station
all
right
agreed
patsy
only
please
do
argue
sure
i
sick
entirely
of
arguing
she
dropped
down
on
a
trunk
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
baggageman
watched
her
hypnotized
with
curiosity
and
wonder
at
the
next
station
he
helped
her
to
drop
through
the
opening
she
had
entered
and
called
a
shamefaced
after
her
in
the
dusk
she
hunted
up
the
and
received
scanty
encouragement
very
likely
he
had
seen
such
a
man
there
were
many
of
that
description
getting
off
every
day
they
generally
went
to
the
inn
brambleside
inn
the
season
was
just
open
and
society
people
were
beginning
to
come
no
there
was
no
conveyance
the
inn
did
not
meet
any
train
after
the
from
town
unless
ordered
especially
by
guests
was
she
expected
patsy
was
about
to
shake
her
head
when
a
roadster
swung
around
the
corner
of
the
station
and
came
to
a
dead
stop
in
front
of
where
she
and
the
were
standing
the
driver
peered
at
her
through
his
goggles
in
a
questioning
hesitating
manner
is
this
are
you
miss
st
regis
he
finally
asked
miriam
st
regis
patsy
intended
it
for
a
question
realizing
even
as
she
spoke
the
absurdity
of
inquiring
the
name
of
an
english
actress
at
such
a
place
but
the
driver
took
it
for
a
statement
of
identity
yes
of
course
miss
miriam
regis
blake
made
a
mistake
and
thought
because
your
box
came
from
town
you
be
coming
that
way
it
was
until
your
manager
travis
telephoned
half
an
hour
ago
that
he
realized
you
be
on
that
southbound
train
awfully
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
step
right
in
please
whereupon
the
driver
removed
himself
from
the
roadster
assisted
her
to
a
seat
covered
her
with
a
rug
for
early
june
evenings
can
be
rather
sharp
and
the
next
moment
patsy
found
herself
tearing
down
a
stretch
of
country
road
with
the
purr
of
a
motor
as
music
to
her
ears
sure
i
do
know
who
wrote
the
play
and
starred
me
in
it
she
mused
dreamily
but
he
certainly
knows
how
to
handle
situations
for
the
space
of
a
few
breaths
she
gave
herself
over
completely
to
the
luxury
of
bodily
comfort
and
mental
inertia
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
have
been
content
to
keep
on
whirling
into
an
eternity
of
darkness
with
a
destination
so
remote
and
a
mission
so
obscure
as
not
to
be
of
the
slightest
disturbance
to
her
immediate
consciousness
all
she
asked
of
fate
that
moment
was
the
blessedness
of
nothing
and
for
answer
her
mind
was
jerked
back
ruthlessly
to
the
curse
of
more
complexities
the
lights
of
a
large
building
in
the
distance
reminded
her
there
was
more
work
for
her
wits
before
her
and
no
time
to
lose
i
must
think
think
think
and
it
grows
harder
every
minute
if
miriam
regis
is
coming
here
it
means
like
as
not
she
filling
in
between
seasons
entertaining
well
until
she
comes
they
all
hearty
welcome
to
the
mistake
they
made
and
afterward
troth
be
a
corner
in
her
room
for
me
the
night
or
saint
michael
a
sinner
either
way
is
all
right
the
driver
unbundled
her
and
helped
her
out
as
courteously
as
he
had
helped
her
in
he
led
the
way
across
a
broad
veranda
to
the
main
entrance
and
there
she
fell
behind
him
as
he
pushed
open
the
great
swinging
door
oh
that
you
masters
did
miss
regis
come
sure
thing
sir
she
right
here
the
next
moment
patsy
stood
in
a
blaze
of
lights
between
a
personally
conducting
chauffeur
and
a
pompous
hotel
manager
who
looked
down
upon
her
with
distrustful
scrutiny
she
was
wholly
aware
of
every
inch
of
her
appearance
the
shabbiness
of
her
brown
norfolk
suit
the
rakishness
of
her
boyish
brown
beaver
hat
and
the
vagabond
gloves
but
of
what
value
is
the
precedent
of
having
been
found
hanging
on
the
thorn
of
a
killarney
by
the
physician
to
the
king
of
what
value
is
the
knowledge
of
past
kinship
with
a
certain
dan
if
one
allows
a
little
matter
of
clothes
to
spoil
one
entrance
and
murder
one
lines
the
blood
came
flushing
back
into
patsy
cheeks
turning
them
the
color
of
thorn
bloom
and
her
eyes
deepened
to
the
blue
of
killarney
sparkling
as
when
the
sun
goes
she
smiled
a
fresh
radiant
witching
smile
upon
that
clay
lump
of
commercialism
until
she
saw
his
appraisement
of
her
treble
its
original
figure
then
she
said
sweetly
i
have
had
rather
a
hard
time
getting
here
blake
making
connections
in
your
country
is
not
always
as
simple
as
one
might
expect
my
room
please
and
with
an
air
of
a
grand
duchess
patsy
late
of
the
irish
national
players
dublin
and
later
of
the
women
free
ward
of
the
city
hospital
led
the
way
across
one
of
the
most
brilliant
summer
hotel
foyers
in
america
as
she
entered
the
elevator
a
young
man
stepped
out
a
young
man
with
a
small
blond
persevering
mustache
a
rather
thin
esthetic
melancholy
face
and
a
myopic
squint
he
wore
a
balmacaan
of
scotch
tweed
and
carried
a
round
plush
hat
patsy
turned
to
the
did
that
man
arrive
yes
miss
i
took
him
up
what
is
his
name
do
you
know
ca
say
miss
i
find
out
if
you
like
there
is
no
need
i
rather
think
i
know
it
myself
and
under
her
breath
she
ejaculated
saint
peter
deliver
us
iv
the
occupant
of
a
balmacaan
coat
safe
in
her
room
with
the
door
closed
and
locked
patsy
stood
transfixed
before
a
trunk
likewise
closed
and
locked
thank
heaven
for
many
blessings
she
said
fervently
thank
heaven
miriam
regis
has
worn
wigs
of
every
conceivable
color
and
style
on
the
stage
so
there
is
small
chance
of
any
one
here
knowing
the
real
color
of
her
hair
thank
heaven
she
given
to
missing
her
engagements
and
not
wiring
about
it
until
the
next
day
thank
heaven
i
played
with
her
long
enough
to
imitate
her
mannerisms
and
know
her
well
enough
to
explain
away
the
night
if
the
need
ever
comes
thank
heaven
that
george
travis
is
an
old
friend
and
can
help
out
if
i
fail
thank
heaven
for
all
of
these
but
holy
saint
patrick
how
will
i
ever
be
getting
inside
that
box
on
the
heels
of
her
fervor
came
an
inspiration
off
came
her
gloves
and
hat
off
came
coat
and
skirt
blouse
and
shoes
and
into
the
closet
they
all
went
for
whereas
patsy
could
carry
off
her
shabbiness
before
masculine
eyes
she
had
neither
the
desire
nor
the
fortitude
to
brave
the
keener
more
critical
gaze
of
her
own
sex
it
was
always
for
the
women
that
patsy
dressed
and
above
all
else
did
she
stand
in
awe
of
the
opinion
of
the
hotel
chambermaid
going
down
in
tottering
submission
before
it
unlocking
her
door
she
rang
the
bell
then
crept
in
between
the
covers
of
her
bed
drawing
them
up
about
her
the
chambermaid
came
and
patsy
ordered
the
housekeeper
the
housekeeper
came
and
patsy
explained
to
her
the
loss
of
her
bag
the
loss
of
the
keys
was
only
implied
it
was
a
part
of
patsy
creed
of
life
never
to
lie
unless
cornered
she
further
implied
that
she
was
entertaining
no
worry
as
a
hotel
always
carried
a
bunch
of
skeleton
trunk
keys
for
the
convenience
of
their
guests
patsy
inspiration
worked
to
perfection
in
a
few
minutes
the
inn
had
proved
itself
a
hostelry
and
the
trunk
stood
open
before
her
alone
again
she
slipped
out
of
bed
to
lock
the
door
and
investigate
a
wistaria
was
on
in
a
twinkling
with
quilted
slippers
to
match
then
patsy
eager
fingers
drew
forth
a
dark
emerald
velvet
with
bodice
and
panniers
of
gold
lace
and
she
clasped
it
ecstatically
in
her
arms
miriam
always
had
divine
taste
but
the
faeries
must
have
guided
her
hand
for
the
choosing
of
this
sure
i
be
feeling
like
a
daughter
if
i
was
so
weak
and
heartsick
i
feel
more
like
a
young
gosling
that
some
one
has
coaxed
out
of
its
shell
a
day
too
soon
is
it
the
effect
of
billy
burgeman
i
wonder
or
the
from
the
city
hospital
or
an
overdose
of
foolishness
or
hunger
just
miss
regis
dined
in
her
own
room
and
she
dined
like
a
daughter
with
an
appetite
whetted
by
weeks
of
convalescing
charity
fare
even
the
possible
appearance
at
any
minute
of
her
original
self
offered
no
terrors
for
her
in
the
presence
of
such
a
feast
at
that
evening
when
the
manager
sent
the
to
call
her
she
looked
every
inch
the
king
daughter
she
had
dined
the
accustomed
to
creations
gave
her
a
frank
stare
of
admiration
which
patsy
noted
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
she
was
ravishing
the
green
and
gold
brought
out
the
tawny
red
glint
of
her
hair
which
was
bound
with
two
gold
bands
about
the
head
ending
in
tiny
emerald
clasps
over
the
barely
discoverable
tips
of
her
ears
little
gold
shoes
twinkled
in
and
out
of
the
clinging
green
as
she
walked
faith
i
feel
like
a
whiff
of
old
ireland
herself
was
patsy
subconscious
comment
as
miss
regis
crossed
the
stage
and
something
of
the
feeling
must
have
been
wafted
across
the
footlights
to
the
audience
for
it
drew
in
its
breath
with
a
little
gasp
of
genuine
appreciation
she
heard
it
and
was
grateful
for
the
few
seconds
it
gave
her
to
look
at
the
program
the
manager
had
handed
her
as
she
was
entering
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
miss
regis
might
arrange
her
program
beforehand
that
the
audience
might
be
expecting
something
definite
and
desired
in
the
form
of
entertainment
it
took
all
the
control
of
a
irish
head
to
keep
her
from
bolting
for
the
little
stage
door
after
one
glance
at
the
paper
her
eye
had
caught
the
impersonation
of
two
american
actresses
she
had
never
seen
the
reading
of
a
hawaiian
love
poem
she
had
never
heard
of
and
scenes
from
two
plays
she
had
never
read
it
was
all
too
deliciously
absurdly
horrible
for
words
and
then
patsy
geared
up
her
wits
as
any
true
kinswoman
of
dan
should
in
a
flash
there
came
back
to
her
what
the
company
had
done
once
when
they
were
playing
stands
and
the
wrong
scenery
had
come
for
the
play
advertised
it
was
worth
trying
here
dear
people
said
patsy
regis
smiling
at
the
audience
as
one
friend
to
another
i
have
had
so
many
requests
from
among
you
since
i
made
out
my
program
to
give
instead
an
evening
of
old
irish
tales
that
i
have
capitulated
you
shall
have
your
wish
the
almost
unbelievable
applause
that
greeted
her
tempted
her
to
further
wickedness
very
few
people
seem
ever
to
remember
that
i
had
an
irish
grandfather
denis
regis
and
that
i
like
once
in
a
while
to
be
getting
back
to
the
sod
there
was
something
so
hypnotic
in
her
intimacy
this
taking
of
every
one
into
her
confidence
that
one
budding
youth
forgot
himself
entirely
and
naïvely
remarked
it
a
long
way
to
tipperary
that
clinched
her
success
she
might
have
chanted
old
king
cole
and
reaped
a
houseful
of
applause
as
it
was
she
turned
faery
child
and
led
them
all
forth
to
the
land
of
faery
a
world
that
neighbored
so
close
to
the
real
with
her
that
long
ago
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
carrying
a
good
bit
of
it
about
with
her
wherever
she
went
it
was
small
wonder
therefore
that
at
the
end
of
the
evening
when
she
fixed
upon
a
certain
young
man
in
the
audience
a
man
with
a
persevering
mustache
an
esthetic
face
and
a
melancholy
myopic
squint
and
told
the
last
tale
to
him
direct
that
he
felt
called
upon
to
go
to
her
as
she
came
down
the
steps
into
the
and
express
his
abject
worshipful
admiration
that
all
right
patsy
cut
him
short
but
but
it
would
sound
so
much
nicer
outside
somewhere
in
the
moonlight
away
from
everybody
would
it
now
this
sudden
amending
of
with
arch
coquetry
would
have
sounded
highly
amusing
to
ears
less
than
the
erstwhile
wearer
of
the
balmacaan
but
he
heard
in
it
only
the
flattering
tribute
to
a
man
chosen
of
men
and
the
hand
that
reached
for
patsy
was
almost
masterful
oh
would
you
really
he
asked
and
he
almost
broke
his
melancholy
with
a
smile
it
must
be
my
clothes
was
her
mental
comment
as
he
led
her
away
they
gone
to
my
own
head
it
not
altogether
strange
touched
his
a
bit
but
for
a
man
who
forged
his
father
name
and
lost
the
girl
he
loved
and
then
plunged
into
mortal
despair
convalescing
terribly
fast
they
had
reached
a
quiet
corner
of
the
veranda
patsy
dropped
into
a
chair
while
her
companion
leaned
against
a
railing
and
looked
down
at
her
with
something
very
like
a
soulful
expression
i
might
have
known
all
along
patsy
was
thinking
that
a
back
like
that
would
have
a
front
like
this
sure
ye
could
get
a
real
man
to
dress
in
petticoats
and
then
to
settle
all
doubts
she
faced
him
with
grim
determination
i
let
you
bring
me
here
because
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
but
first
of
all
did
you
come
down
here
on
that
train
from
new
york
the
man
nodded
did
you
get
to
the
train
by
a
madison
avenue
car
taken
from
the
corner
of
street
maybe
why
how
did
you
know
the
melancholy
was
giving
place
to
rather
pleased
curiosity
how
do
i
know
patsy
glared
at
him
i
know
because
i
followed
you
every
inch
of
the
way
followed
you
to
tell
you
i
believed
in
you
you
you
and
her
voice
broke
with
a
groan
oh
i
say
that
was
awfully
good
of
you
this
time
the
smile
had
right
of
way
and
such
a
flattered
smile
as
it
was
you
know
everybody
takes
me
rather
as
a
joke
joke
patsy
eyes
blazed
well
you
the
most
serious
impossible
joke
i
ever
met
this
side
of
london
why
a
person
would
have
to
dynamite
his
sense
of
humor
to
appreciate
you
i
do
think
i
understand
he
felt
about
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
drew
forth
a
monocle
which
he
adjusted
carefully
would
you
mind
saying
that
again
patsy
hands
dropped
helplessly
to
her
lap
i
could
only
after
a
woman
has
trailed
a
man
she
does
know
across
a
country
she
does
know
to
a
place
she
does
know
and
without
a
wardrobe
trunk
a
letter
of
credit
or
a
maid
just
to
tell
him
she
believes
in
him
he
becomes
the
most
tragically
serious
thing
that
ever
happened
to
her
in
all
her
life
oh
i
say
i
always
thought
they
were
pretty
good
but
i
never
thought
any
one
would
appreciate
my
poetry
like
that
poetry
do
you
do
that
too
that
all
i
do
i
am
devoting
my
life
to
it
that
why
my
family
take
me
a
little
flippantly
a
faint
streak
of
hope
shot
through
patsy
mind
would
you
mind
telling
me
your
name
why
i
thought
you
knew
i
thought
you
said
that
was
why
you
wanted
to
to
hang
it
all
my
name
wilfred
patsy
was
on
her
feet
clasping
her
hands
in
a
shameless
burst
of
emotion
while
she
dropped
into
her
own
tongue
oh
that
a
beautiful
name
a
grand
name
do
ye
ever
be
changing
it
and
ye
ever
give
up
writing
poetry
it
a
beautiful
pastime
for
any
man
by
that
name
but
what
what
in
the
name
of
saint
columkill
ever
happened
to
billy
burgeman
billy
burgeman
why
he
came
down
on
the
train
with
me
and
went
back
to
arden
patsy
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
laughed
until
she
almost
feared
she
could
not
stop
laughing
and
then
she
suddenly
became
conscious
of
the
pompous
manager
standing
beside
her
a
yellow
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
will
you
kindly
explain
what
this
means
and
he
slapped
the
paper
viciously
i
try
to
said
patsy
but
will
you
tell
me
just
one
thing
first
how
far
is
it
to
arden
arden
it
seven
miles
to
arden
but
what
that
got
to
do
with
this
this
is
a
wire
from
miss
regis
saying
she
is
ill
and
will
be
unable
to
fill
her
engagement
here
now
who
are
you
i
why
i
her
understudy
of
course
and
i
so
happy
whereupon
patricia
late
of
the
irish
national
players
and
later
of
the
women
free
ward
of
the
city
hospital
crumpled
up
on
the
veranda
floor
in
a
dead
faint
v
a
tinker
points
the
road
the
brambleside
inn
lost
one
of
its
guests
at
an
inconceivably
early
hour
the
morning
after
patsy
unexpectedly
filled
miss
regis
engagement
there
the
guest
departed
by
way
of
the
piazza
and
a
and
not
even
the
night
watchman
saw
her
go
but
it
was
not
until
she
had
put
a
mile
or
more
of
open
country
between
herself
and
the
inn
that
patsy
indulged
in
the
freedom
of
a
long
breath
after
this
i
keep
away
from
inns
and
such
like
is
too
to
make
it
anyways
comfortable
i
feel
now
as
if
i
been
caught
lifting
the
crown
jewels
instead
of
giving
a
performance
for
the
price
of
a
night
bed
and
board
and
coming
away
as
poor
as
a
tinker
ass
a
smile
caught
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
a
twitching
memory
smile
she
was
thinking
of
the
note
she
had
left
folded
in
with
the
gown
in
miriam
regis
trunk
in
it
she
had
stated
her
payment
of
one
irish
grandfather
by
the
name
of
denis
in
return
for
the
loan
of
the
dress
and
had
hoped
that
miriam
would
find
him
handy
on
future
public
occasions
patsy
could
not
forbear
chuckling
outright
the
picture
of
anything
so
unmitigatedly
british
as
miriam
regis
with
an
irish
ancestor
trailing
after
her
for
the
rest
of
her
career
was
too
entrancing
an
early
morning
wind
was
blowing
fresh
from
the
and
black
birch
and
sassafras
such
a
clean
world
of
open
country
it
looked
to
patsy
as
her
eye
followed
the
road
before
her
on
to
the
greening
meadows
and
wooded
slopes
that
her
heart
joined
the
chorus
of
and
who
sang
from
the
sheer
gladness
of
being
a
live
part
of
it
all
she
sighed
not
knowing
it
faith
i
wishing
was
more
nor
seven
miles
to
arden
i
like
to
be
following
the
road
for
days
and
days
and
keeping
the
length
of
it
between
billy
burgeman
and
myself
starting
before
the
country
was
astir
she
had
met
no
one
of
whom
she
could
inquire
the
way
a
less
adventuresome
soul
than
patsy
might
have
sat
herself
down
and
waited
for
direction
but
that
would
have
meant
wasting
minutes
precious
minutes
before
the
dawn
should
break
and
she
should
be
no
longer
sole
possessor
of
the
road
and
the
world
that
bounded
it
so
patsy
chose
the
way
for
herself
content
that
it
would
lead
her
to
her
destination
in
the
end
the
joy
of
true
vagabondage
was
rampant
within
her
there
was
the
road
urging
her
like
an
impatient
comrade
to
be
gone
there
was
her
errand
of
giving
purpose
to
her
journey
and
the
facts
that
she
was
homeless
penniless
breakfastless
a
stranger
in
a
strange
country
mattered
not
a
whit
so
thoroughly
had
she
always
believed
in
good
fortune
that
somehow
she
always
managed
to
find
it
and
out
of
this
she
had
evolved
her
philosophy
of
life
ye
see
is
this
way
she
would
say
the
world
is
much
like
a
great
cat
with
claws
to
hide
or
use
as
the
notion
takes
it
if
ye
kick
and
slap
at
it
hump
its
back
and
scratch
at
ye
sure
as
fate
but
if
ye
are
wise
and
a
bit
patient
ye
can
have
it
coaxed
and
smoothed
down
till
it
purring
to
make
room
for
ye
at
any
hearthside
and
there
another
thing
it
well
to
remember
that
folks
are
folks
the
world
over
whether
they
are
wearing
your
dress
and
speaking
your
tongue
or
another
and
as
patsy
was
blessed
in
the
matter
of
philosophy
so
was
she
blessed
in
the
matter
of
possessions
she
did
not
have
to
own
things
to
possess
them
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
patsy
had
a
larger
share
of
the
world
than
many
who
could
reckon
their
estates
in
acreage
or
who
owned
so
many
miles
of
property
she
held
a
mortgage
on
every
inch
of
free
roadway
rugged
hilltop
or
virgin
forest
her
feet
crossed
she
claimed
squatters
rights
on
every
bit
of
shaded
pasture
or
sunlit
glade
or
singing
brook
her
heart
rejoiced
in
in
other
words
everything
outside
of
walls
and
fences
belonged
to
her
by
virtue
of
her
vagabondage
and
she
had
often
found
herself
pitying
the
narrow
folk
who
possessed
only
what
their
deeds
or
titles
allotted
to
them
and
yet
never
in
patsy
life
had
she
felt
quite
so
sure
about
it
as
she
did
this
morning
probably
because
she
had
never
before
set
forth
on
a
adventure
so
heedless
of
means
and
consequences
sure
there
are
enough
wise
people
in
the
world
she
mused
as
she
tramped
along
it
needs
a
few
foolish
ones
to
keep
things
happening
and
could
a
foolish
adventuring
body
be
bound
for
a
better
place
than
arden
she
rounded
a
bend
in
the
road
and
came
upon
a
stretch
of
old
stump
fencing
from
one
of
the
stumps
appeared
to
be
hanging
a
grotesque
figure
of
some
remarkable
cut
it
looked
both
ancient
and
romantic
sharply
silhouetted
against
the
iridescence
of
the
dawn
patsy
eyed
it
curiously
it
comes
natural
for
me
to
be
partial
to
anything
hanging
to
a
thorn
or
a
stump
but
barring
that
it
still
looks
interesting
as
she
came
abreast
it
she
saw
it
was
not
hanging
however
it
was
perched
on
a
lower
prong
of
a
root
and
it
was
a
man
clothed
in
the
most
absolute
garment
of
rags
patsy
had
ever
seen
off
the
legitimate
stage
from
an
artistic
standpoint
they
are
perfect
was
patsy
mental
tribute
would
willie
fay
give
his
sunday
dinner
if
he
could
gather
him
in
as
he
is
just
to
play
the
tinker
faith
those
rags
are
so
real
i
wager
he
keeps
them
together
only
by
the
grace
of
god
as
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
figure
he
turned
his
head
slowly
and
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
as
far
away
and
bewildered
as
a
lost
baby
in
the
of
the
coming
day
he
looked
supernatural
a
strange
spirit
from
under
the
earth
or
above
the
earth
but
not
of
the
earth
this
was
borne
in
upon
patsy
consciousness
and
it
set
her
celtic
blood
tingling
and
her
eyes
he
looks
as
as
those
back
in
the
old
country
who
have
the
second
sight
and
see
the
faeries
aye
and
he
as
young
and
handsome
as
a
king
son
poor
lad
and
then
she
called
aloud
is
a
brave
day
this
hmm
was
the
response
rendered
impartially
patsy
alert
eyes
spied
a
nondescript
kit
flung
down
in
the
grass
at
the
man
feet
and
they
set
then
ye
a
tinker
hmm
was
again
the
answer
it
conveyed
an
impression
of
hesitant
doubt
as
if
the
speaker
would
have
avoided
if
he
could
the
responsibility
of
being
anything
at
all
even
a
tinker
that
grand
encouraged
patsy
i
like
tinkers
and
what
more
i
a
bit
of
a
vagabond
myself
i
grant
ye
that
of
late
years
the
tinkers
are
treated
none
too
hearty
about
ireland
but
there
was
a
time
patsy
mind
trailed
off
into
the
far
past
into
a
maze
of
legend
and
wherein
tinkers
were
figures
of
romance
and
mystery
it
was
good
luck
then
to
fall
in
with
such
company
and
patsy
being
more
a
product
of
past
romance
than
present
civilization
was
pleased
to
read
into
this
meeting
the
promise
of
a
fair
road
and
success
to
her
quest
moreover
there
was
another
appeal
the
apparent
helpless
bewilderment
of
the
man
himself
and
his
unreality
he
was
certainly
not
in
possession
of
all
his
senses
from
whatever
world
he
might
have
dropped
and
helplessness
in
man
or
beast
was
a
blood
bond
with
patsy
making
instant
claim
on
her
own
abundant
sympathies
and
wits
she
held
the
tinker
with
a
smile
of
open
comradeship
while
her
voice
took
on
an
alluring
hint
of
suggestion
ye
ca
be
thinking
of
hanging
onto
that
stump
all
day
now
what
road
might
ye
be
taking
the
one
to
arden
for
some
minutes
the
tinker
considered
her
and
her
question
with
an
exaggerated
gravity
then
he
nodded
his
head
in
a
final
agreement
grand
i
bound
that
way
myself
maybe
ye
know
arden
maybe
and
how
far
might
it
be
seven
miles
patsy
wrinkled
her
forehead
that
strange
was
seven
miles
last
night
and
i
tramped
half
the
distance
already
i
thinking
never
mind
what
behind
wo
trouble
me
and
the
rest
of
the
way
will
soon
pass
in
good
company
come
on
and
she
beckoned
her
head
in
indisputable
command
once
again
he
considered
her
slowly
then
as
if
satisfied
he
swung
himself
down
from
his
perch
on
the
stump
fence
gathered
up
his
kit
and
in
another
minute
had
fallen
into
step
with
her
and
the
two
were
contentedly
tramping
along
the
road
the
man
who
writing
this
play
mused
patsy
is
trying
to
match
wits
with
willie
shakespeare
if
any
one
finds
him
out
they
have
him
up
for
plagiarizing
she
chuckled
aloud
which
caused
the
tinker
to
cast
an
uneasy
glance
in
her
direction
poor
lad
the
are
always
suspicious
of
others
wits
he
thinks
i
fey
and
then
aloud
maybe
ye
are
not
knowing
it
but
anything
at
all
is
likely
to
happen
to
ye
on
the
road
to
arden
according
to
willie
shakespeare
whom
ye
are
not
likely
to
be
acquainted
with
it
a
place
where
philosophers
and
banished
dukes
and
peasants
and
youths
and
lions
and
serpents
all
live
happily
together
under
the
tree
now
i
the
banished
duke
own
daughter
only
no
one
knows
it
and
ye
sure
ye
can
take
your
choice
between
playing
the
younger
brother
or
the
fool
the
fool
said
the
tinker
solemnly
and
then
of
a
sudden
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
patsy
stopped
still
on
the
road
and
considered
him
narrowly
could
ye
laugh
again
she
suggested
when
the
laugh
was
ended
it
improves
ye
wonderfully
an
afterthought
flashed
in
her
mind
after
all
said
and
done
the
fool
is
the
best
part
in
the
whole
play
after
this
they
tramped
along
in
silence
the
tinker
kept
a
little
in
advance
his
head
erect
his
hands
swinging
loosely
at
his
sides
his
eyes
on
nothing
at
all
he
seemed
oblivious
of
what
lay
back
of
him
or
before
him
and
only
half
conscious
of
the
companion
at
his
side
but
patsy
fancy
was
busy
with
a
hundred
things
while
her
eyes
went
afield
for
every
scrap
of
prettiness
the
country
held
there
were
meadows
of
brilliant
daisies
broken
by
clumps
of
silver
poplars
white
birches
and
a
solitary
sentinel
pine
and
there
was
the
roadside
tangle
with
its
constant
surprises
of
meadowsweet
and
columbine
white
violets
in
the
swampy
places
and
once
in
a
while
an
early
wild
rose
in
ireland
she
mused
the
gorse
would
be
out
fringing
the
pastures
and
on
the
roadside
would
be
heartsease
and
faery
thimbles
and
perhaps
a
few
late
primroses
and
the
meadow
would
be
green
with
corn
a
faint
wisp
of
a
sigh
escaped
her
at
the
thought
and
the
tinker
looked
across
at
her
questioningly
sure
it
my
heart
hungering
a
bit
for
the
bogland
and
a
whiff
of
the
turf
smoke
this
exile
idea
is
a
grand
one
for
a
play
but
it
gets
lonesome
at
times
in
real
life
maybe
ye
are
irish
yourself
maybe
it
was
patsy
turn
to
glance
across
at
the
tinker
but
all
she
saw
was
the
wondering
look
that
she
had
seen
first
in
his
face
poor
lad
like
as
not
he
finds
it
hard
remembering
where
he
from
they
all
do
i
not
pester
him
again
he
looked
up
and
caught
her
eyes
upon
him
and
smiled
foolishly
patsy
smiled
back
do
ye
know
lad
i
not
had
a
morsel
of
breakfast
this
day
have
ye
any
money
with
ye
by
chance
the
tinker
stopped
put
down
his
kit
and
hunted
about
in
his
rags
where
the
pocket
places
might
be
but
all
he
drew
forth
were
his
two
empty
hands
he
looked
down
the
stretch
of
road
they
had
come
with
an
odd
twist
to
his
mouth
then
he
burst
forth
into
another
laugh
have
ye
been
playing
the
pigeon
and
some
one
plucked
ye
she
asked
and
went
on
without
waiting
for
his
answer
never
mind
sharpen
up
our
wits
afresh
and
earn
a
breakfast
are
ye
handy
at
tinkering
now
you
bet
i
am
said
the
tinker
it
was
the
longest
speech
he
had
made
at
the
next
farm
patsy
turned
in
with
a
warning
to
the
tinker
to
do
as
he
was
told
and
to
hold
his
tongue
it
was
a
thoroughly
farm
and
she
picked
out
what
she
decided
must
be
the
side
door
and
knocked
a
woman
opened
it
and
patsy
smiled
with
the
good
promise
of
her
looks
we
are
two
down
on
our
luck
and
strangers
hereabouts
have
ye
got
any
tinkering
jobs
for
my
man
there
he
a
bit
odd
and
says
little
but
he
can
solder
a
broken
pot
or
mend
a
machine
with
the
best
and
we
take
out
our
pay
in
a
good
hearty
meal
there
be
a
pile
of
dishes
in
the
pantry
i
put
by
till
we
was
goin
to
town
handles
off
and
holes
in
the
bottom
he
can
mend
them
out
on
the
stoop
if
he
likes
i
got
to
help
with
we
this
season
are
ye
just
then
i
thinking
i
come
in
handy
patsy
smiled
her
smile
of
winning
comradeship
as
she
stooped
and
picked
up
a
tray
of
empty
that
stood
by
the
door
while
the
woman
smile
deepened
with
honest
appreciation
my
but
you
are
willing
folks
they
sometimes
scarce
here
faith
we
hungry
folks
so
ye
best
set
us
quickly
to
work
they
left
the
tinker
on
the
stoop
surrounded
by
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
household
goods
patsy
cast
an
anxious
backward
glance
at
him
but
saw
that
he
was
rolling
up
the
rags
that
served
for
sleeves
thereby
baring
a
pair
of
brawny
arms
while
he
spread
his
tools
before
him
after
the
manner
of
a
man
who
knows
his
business
fine
commented
patsy
with
an
inner
satisfaction
he
may
be
foolish
but
i
bet
he
can
tinker
they
picked
berries
for
an
hour
or
more
and
then
patsy
turned
too
and
helped
the
woman
get
dinner
they
bustled
about
in
silence
to
the
accompanying
pounding
and
scraping
of
the
tinker
who
worked
unceasingly
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
at
last
there
was
a
tableful
the
woman
and
her
husband
patsy
the
tinker
and
the
hands
and
before
them
was
spread
the
very
best
the
farm
could
give
it
was
as
if
the
woman
wished
to
pay
their
gift
of
service
with
her
unstinted
bounty
we
always
ask
a
blessin
said
the
farmer
simply
folding
his
hands
on
the
table
about
to
begin
then
he
looked
at
patsy
and
with
that
natural
courtesy
that
is
common
to
the
true
man
of
the
soil
he
added
we
be
pleased
if
you
ask
it
patsy
bowed
her
head
a
little
whimsical
smile
crept
to
her
lips
but
her
voice
rang
deep
with
feeling
for
food
and
fellowship
good
lord
we
thank
thee
amen
and
she
added
under
her
breath
and
take
a
good
grip
of
the
rich
man
son
till
we
get
him
the
late
afternoon
found
them
back
on
the
road
once
more
they
parted
from
the
farmer
and
his
wife
as
friend
parts
with
friend
the
woman
slipped
a
bundle
of
food
bread
cheese
and
meat
left
from
the
dinner
with
a
box
of
berries
into
patsy
hand
while
the
man
gave
the
tinker
a
and
wished
him
luck
patsy
thanked
them
for
both
but
it
was
not
until
they
were
well
out
of
earshot
that
she
spoke
to
the
tinker
they
are
good
folk
but
they
never
understand
in
a
thousand
years
how
we
came
to
be
traveling
along
together
what
folks
do
know
ca
hurt
them
and
often
easier
holding
your
tongue
than
trying
to
explain
what
will
never
get
through
another
brain
now
put
that
lunch
into
your
kit
it
may
come
in
handy
who
knows
and
god
blessing
on
all
kind
hearts
whereupon
the
tinker
nodded
solemnly
they
had
tramped
for
a
mile
or
more
when
they
came
to
a
marked
by
a
little
white
church
from
the
moment
they
sighted
it
patsy
feet
began
to
lag
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
crossing
of
the
ways
she
had
stopped
altogether
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
little
gold
cross
with
an
odd
expression
of
whimsical
earnestness
do
ye
know
she
said
slowly
clasping
the
hands
long
shorn
of
the
vagabond
gloves
do
ye
know
i
told
so
many
lies
these
last
two
days
i
think
i
bide
yonder
for
a
bit
and
see
can
saint
anthony
lift
the
sins
from
me
make
the
rest
o
the
road
less
burdensome
do
ye
think
the
tinker
looked
uncomfortably
confused
as
though
this
sudden
question
of
ethics
or
religion
was
too
much
for
his
scattered
wits
he
dug
the
toe
of
his
boot
in
the
gravel
of
the
church
path
and
removed
his
cap
to
aid
the
labor
of
his
thinking
maybe
he
agreed
at
last
an
will
i
be
waitin
for
you
or
keepin
on
ye
wait
of
course
commanded
patsy
she
had
barely
disappeared
through
the
little
white
door
and
the
tinker
thrown
himself
down
with
his
back
to
the
which
marked
the
roads
when
a
sorrel
mare
and
a
runabout
came
racing
down
the
road
over
which
they
had
just
come
there
were
two
men
in
the
runabout
both
of
them
tense
and
alert
their
heads
craned
far
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
them
their
eyes
scanning
the
diverging
roads
i
she
gone
that
way
the
driver
swung
the
whip
indicating
the
road
that
ran
south
wall
i
so
too
agreed
the
other
but
then
again
she
might
they
reined
in
and
discovered
the
tinker
some
one
passed
this
way
sence
you
been
settin
there
they
inquired
almost
in
unison
i
do
know
the
tinker
fingers
passed
hurriedly
across
his
eyes
and
forehead
by
way
of
seeking
misplaced
wits
some
one
might
be
almost
any
one
he
smiled
cheerfully
look
here
young
feller
if
you
tryin
to
be
smart
the
driver
began
angrily
but
his
companion
silenced
him
with
a
nudge
and
a
finger
tapped
significantly
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
he
moderated
his
tone
we
after
a
girl
in
a
brown
suit
and
hat
undersized
girl
she
was
asking
the
way
to
arden
seen
any
one
of
that
description
what
do
you
want
with
her
never
mind
growled
the
first
man
but
the
second
volunteered
meager
information
she
a
suspect
stayed
last
night
in
the
inn
and
this
morning
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
is
missin
that
what
we
want
her
for
the
tinker
brightened
perceptibly
guess
she
went
by
in
a
wagon
half
an
hour
ago
that
way
i
think
i
saw
her
and
as
the
men
turned
southward
down
the
road
marked
arden
he
called
after
them
better
hurry
if
you
want
to
catch
her
the
wagon
was
going
at
a
right
smart
pace
he
waited
for
their
backs
to
be
turned
and
for
the
crack
of
the
whip
that
lifted
the
heels
of
the
sorrel
above
the
dashboard
before
she
plunged
then
with
amazing
speed
of
mind
as
well
as
of
body
he
wrenched
every
sign
from
the
post
and
pitched
them
out
of
sight
behind
a
neighboring
stone
wall
the
dust
from
departing
wheels
still
filled
the
air
when
patsy
stepped
out
of
the
church
peacefully
radiant
and
found
the
tinker
sitting
quietly
with
his
back
against
the
post
so
ye
are
still
here
i
thought
ye
might
have
grown
tired
of
my
company
after
all
and
gone
on
patsy
laughed
happily
now
do
ye
know
which
road
goes
to
arden
sure
and
the
tinker
joined
in
her
laugh
while
he
pointed
to
the
straight
road
ahead
the
road
that
ran
west
at
right
angles
to
the
one
the
runabout
had
taken
come
on
then
said
patsy
we
ought
to
be
there
by
sundown
she
stopped
and
looked
him
over
for
the
space
of
a
second
ye
are
improving
wonderfully
mind
ye
must
be
getting
too
or
we
have
to
be
parting
company
why
that
the
why
and
with
this
satisfactory
explanation
she
led
the
way
down
the
road
the
tinker
had
pointed
vi
at
day
end
their
road
went
the
way
of
the
setting
sun
and
patsy
and
the
tinker
traveled
it
leisurely
after
the
fashion
of
those
born
to
the
road
who
find
their
joy
in
the
wandering
not
in
the
making
of
a
distance
or
the
reaching
of
a
destination
since
they
had
left
the
church
behind
patsy
had
marked
the
tinker
casting
furtive
glances
along
the
way
they
had
come
and
each
time
she
marked
as
well
the
flash
of
a
smile
that
lightened
his
face
for
an
instant
when
he
saw
that
the
road
still
remained
empty
of
aught
but
themselves
it
odd
she
mused
he
has
the
look
of
a
knave
who
might
fear
a
trailing
of
constables
at
his
heels
and
yet
and
yet
his
wits
have
him
pestered
about
something
that
lies
back
of
him
once
it
was
otherwise
there
was
a
rising
of
dust
showing
on
one
of
the
hills
they
had
climbed
a
good
before
when
the
tinker
saw
it
he
reached
of
a
sudden
for
patsy
hand
while
he
pointed
excitedly
beyond
pasture
bars
ahead
to
a
brownish
field
that
lay
some
distance
from
the
road
see
lass
that
sorrel
if
you
break
the
road
along
with
me
i
show
you
where
wild
strawberries
grow
lots
of
her
answer
was
to
take
the
pasture
bars
at
a
run
as
easily
as
any
urchin
the
tinker
swung
himself
after
her
an
odd
wisp
of
a
smile
twisting
the
corners
of
his
mouth
just
such
a
smile
as
the
fool
might
wear
on
the
road
to
arden
the
two
raced
for
the
the
tinker
winning
when
patsy
caught
up
he
was
on
his
knees
his
head
bare
his
eyes
sparkling
riotously
running
his
fingers
exultantly
through
the
green
leaves
that
carpeted
the
ground
see
he
chuckled
the
tinker
knows
somethin
more
solder
and
pots
patsy
eyes
danced
there
they
were
millions
of
the
tiny
red
berries
as
thick
and
luscious
as
if
they
had
been
planted
in
elysian
fields
for
arcadian
folk
to
gather
the
wee
bonnie
things
she
laughed
now
how
were
ye
afther
knowing
they
were
here
the
tinker
cocked
his
head
wisely
i
know
more
that
i
know
where
to
find
yellow
the
yewberries
nests
she
looked
at
him
joyfully
he
was
turning
out
more
and
more
to
her
liking
could
ye
be
showing
them
to
me
lad
she
asked
the
tinker
eyed
her
bashfully
would
you
care
then
sure
and
i
would
and
with
that
she
was
flat
on
the
ground
beside
him
her
fingers
flying
in
search
of
strawberries
so
close
they
lay
to
the
earth
so
hidden
by
the
waving
sorrel
and
neighboring
timothy
that
had
a
whole
county
full
of
constables
been
abroad
they
could
have
passed
within
earshot
and
never
seen
them
there
with
silence
between
them
they
ate
until
their
lips
were
red
and
the
cloud
of
dust
on
the
hill
back
of
them
had
whirled
past
attendant
on
a
sorrel
mare
and
runabout
they
ate
until
the
road
was
quite
empty
once
more
and
then
the
tinker
pulled
patsy
to
her
feet
by
way
of
reminding
her
that
arden
still
lay
beyond
them
do
ye
know
said
patsy
after
another
silence
and
they
were
once
more
afoot
i
a
bit
doubtful
if
the
banished
duke
daughter
ever
tasted
anything
half
as
sweet
as
those
berries
on
her
road
to
arden
or
for
that
matter
if
she
found
her
fool
half
as
wise
i
mortial
glad
ye
did
fall
off
that
stump
this
morning
afore
i
came
by
to
fetch
ye
off
the
tinker
doffed
his
battered
cap
unexpectedly
and
swept
her
an
astounding
bow
holy
saint
christopher
ejaculated
patsy
ye
be
telling
me
ye
know
willie
shakespeare
next
but
the
tinker
answered
with
a
blank
stare
while
the
bewildered
look
of
fear
came
back
to
his
eyes
who
he
does
he
live
here
he
asked
dully
patsy
wrinkled
a
perplexed
forehead
lad
lad
ye
have
me
bursting
with
wonderment
ye
are
a
rare
combination
even
for
an
irish
tinker
but
if
ye
are
a
fair
sample
of
what
they
are
over
here
sure
the
states
have
the
old
country
beaten
entirely
and
the
tinker
laughed
as
he
had
laughed
once
before
that
day
the
free
untrammeled
laugh
of
youth
while
he
saucily
mimicked
her
irish
brogue
sure
is
the
road
to
arden
ye
were
sayin
and
at
all
can
happen
on
the
way
the
girl
laughed
with
him
and
ye
be
telling
me
next
that
this
is
three
hundred
years
ago
and
romance
and
willie
shakespeare
are
still
alive
her
mind
went
racing
back
to
the
days
the
days
when
chivalry
walked
abroad
before
it
took
up
its
permanent
residence
between
the
covers
of
when
poets
and
saints
kings
sons
and
tinkers
journeyed
afar
to
prove
their
manhood
in
deeds
instead
of
inheritances
when
it
was
no
shame
to
live
by
wits
or
ask
hospitality
at
any
strange
door
ah
those
were
the
days
and
yet
and
yet
could
not
those
days
be
given
back
to
the
world
again
and
would
not
the
world
be
made
a
merrier
sweeter
place
because
of
them
if
patsy
could
have
had
her
way
she
would
have
gone
forth
at
the
ring
of
each
new
day
like
the
angel
in
the
folk
tale
and
with
her
shears
cut
the
nets
that
bound
humanity
down
to
petty
differences
in
creed
or
birth
or
tongue
faith
it
makes
one
sick
she
thought
we
tell
our
children
the
tales
of
the
red
branch
knights
of
king
arthur
and
the
knights
of
the
grail
and
rejoice
afresh
over
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
them
we
stand
by
the
hour
worshiping
at
the
pictures
of
the
saints
simple
men
and
women
who
just
went
about
doing
kindness
and
we
read
the
holy
book
the
tales
of
christ
with
his
fishermen
wandering
about
looking
for
some
good
deed
to
do
some
helpfulness
to
give
some
word
of
good
cheer
to
speak
and
we
pray
make
us
good
even
as
thou
wert
and
what
does
it
all
mean
we
hurry
through
the
streets
afeared
to
stop
on
the
corner
and
succor
a
stranger
or
ashamed
to
speak
a
friendly
word
to
a
troubled
soul
in
a
and
we
go
home
at
night
and
lock
our
doors
so
that
the
beggar
who
asked
for
a
bit
of
bread
at
noon
ca
come
round
after
dark
and
steal
the
silver
patsy
sighed
regretfully
if
only
this
were
olden
times
she
would
not
be
dreading
to
find
arden
now
and
the
man
she
was
seeking
there
the
tinker
caught
the
sigh
and
looked
over
at
her
with
a
puzzled
frown
tired
he
asked
laconically
aye
a
bit
she
agreed
and
i
wishing
arden
was
still
a
good
seven
miles
away
whereupon
the
tinker
turned
his
head
and
grinned
sheepishly
toward
the
south
the
hills
had
gathered
in
the
last
of
the
sun
unto
themselves
when
the
two
turned
down
the
main
street
of
a
village
it
was
unquestionably
a
village
the
sidewalks
the
freshly
painted
neighboring
the
no
the
homes
with
their
lawns
in
front
and
the
tidily
kept
yards
behind
all
spoke
of
a
decency
and
lawfulness
that
might
easily
have
set
the
hearts
of
the
most
righteous
of
vagabonds
patsy
looked
it
carefully
over
sure
arden
no
name
for
it
at
all
they
better
have
called
it
gospel
center
or
new
canaan
be
a
grand
place
though
to
shut
in
all
the
wilfred
to
keep
them
off
the
county
nerves
and
the
rich
men
sons
to
keep
them
off
the
public
sympathy
but
is
no
place
for
us
lad
the
tinker
shifted
his
kit
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
and
held
his
tongue
their
entrance
was
what
patsy
might
have
termed
fit
the
dogs
of
the
village
were
on
hand
that
escort
of
all
doubtful
characters
barked
them
down
the
street
with
a
lusty
chorus
of
growls
and
snarls
and
sharp
staccato
yaps
there
were
the
children
too
of
course
the
older
ones
followed
after
the
dogs
the
smaller
ones
came
a
stumbling
vanguard
sucking
speculative
thumbs
or
forefingers
as
the
choice
might
be
the
brought
the
to
windows
and
doors
hark
the
dogs
do
bark
the
beggars
are
coming
to
town
quoted
patsy
with
a
grim
little
smile
and
glanced
across
at
the
tinker
he
was
blushing
fiercely
never
mind
lad
is
better
being
barked
into
a
town
than
bitten
out
of
it
for
answer
the
tinker
stopped
and
folded
his
arms
sullenly
i
not
such
a
fool
i
ca
feel
somethin
do
you
reckon
i
know
the
shame
it
is
to
be
keepin
a
decent
woman
company
with
these
rags
and
no
wits
if
i
not
misplaced
my
memory
was
myself
that
chose
the
company
and
was
largely
on
account
of
those
very
things
thinking
do
ye
guess
for
a
minute
that
if
ye
had
been
a
rich
son
in
grand
clothes
and
manners
to
match
i
ever
have
tramped
a
millimeter
with
ye
she
smiled
coaxingly
faith
there
naught
the
matter
with
those
rags
a
king
son
might
be
proud
o
them
as
for
foolishness
i
known
worse
faults
in
a
man
the
tinker
winced
imperceptibly
and
all
unconsciously
patsy
went
on
is
the
heart
of
a
man
that
measures
him
after
all
and
not
the
wits
that
crowd
his
brain
or
the
gold
that
lines
his
pockets
oh
what
do
the
folks
who
sit
snug
by
their
warm
hearthsides
knitting
their
lives
into
comfortables
to
wrap
around
their
real
feelings
and
human
impulses
ever
know
about
their
neighbors
who
come
in
to
drink
tea
with
them
and
what
do
the
neighbors
in
turn
know
about
them
if
i
had
my
way
i
tumble
the
whole
world
out
of
doors
and
set
them
tramping
the
road
to
somewhere
is
the
surest
way
of
getting
them
acquainted
with
themselves
and
the
neighbors
for
that
matter
all
of
us
need
it
just
once
in
so
often
and
so
to
the
road
say
i
with
a
fair
greeting
to
all
alike
be
they
king
son
or
beggar
for
the
road
may
prove
the
one
the
other
afore
the
journey
done
amen
said
the
tinker
devoutly
and
patsy
laughed
they
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
street
midway
between
the
church
and
the
patsy
so
absorbed
in
her
theories
the
tinker
so
absorbed
in
patsy
that
neither
was
aware
of
the
changed
disposition
of
their
circling
escort
until
a
cold
inquisitive
nose
and
a
warm
friendly
tongue
brought
them
to
themselves
greetings
were
returned
in
kind
heads
were
patted
backs
stroked
ears
scratched
only
the
children
stood
aloof
and
unconvinced
that
is
ever
the
way
of
it
it
is
the
dogs
who
can
better
tell
glorious
vagabondage
from
inglorious
rascality
sure
ye
ca
fool
dogs
i
be
taking
the
word
of
a
dog
before
a
man
anywhere
when
it
comes
to
judging
human
beings
patsy
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
children
ye
have
the
creatures
won
over
entirely
is
myself
might
try
what
i
could
do
with
the
wee
ones
if
we
had
the
dogs
and
the
childther
to
say
a
good
word
for
us
faith
the
might
forget
how
terribly
respectable
they
were
and
make
us
welcome
for
one
night
a
sudden
thought
caught
her
memory
i
was
almost
forgetting
why
i
had
come
hunt
up
a
shop
for
me
lad
will
ye
there
must
be
one
down
the
street
a
bit
and
if
ye
loan
me
some
of
that
the
good
man
paid
for
your
tinkering
like
to
be
having
a
new
york
news
if
they
have
one
along
with
the
fixings
for
a
letter
i
have
to
be
writing
while
ye
are
gone
bewitch
the
childther
and
she
did
when
the
tinker
returned
she
was
sitting
on
the
church
steps
the
children
huddled
so
close
about
her
that
she
was
barely
distinguishable
in
the
encircling
mass
of
shingled
heads
bobby
curls
pigtails
and
deaf
little
ears
were
being
turned
to
parental
calls
for
supper
a
state
of
affairs
unprecedented
and
unbelievable
while
patsy
was
bringing
to
an
end
the
tale
of
jack
the
irish
hero
of
a
thousand
and
one
adventures
and
he
married
the
king
daughter
and
they
lived
happier
than
ye
can
tell
me
and
twice
as
happy
as
i
can
tell
ye
in
a
castle
that
had
a
window
for
every
day
in
the
year
that
would
make
a
fine
endin
for
any
lad
story
said
the
tinker
soberly
window
for
every
day
in
the
year
would
mean
a
whole
lot
of
cheerfulness
and
sunshine
would
it
patsy
nodded
but
do
those
who
take
to
the
road
fetch
that
castle
along
with
them
sure
there
it
is
and
her
hand
swept
toward
the
skyline
an
encompassing
circle
about
them
with
the
sun
flooding
it
from
dawn
to
day
end
she
turned
to
the
eager
faces
about
her
waiting
for
more
are
ye
still
there
faith
what
have
i
been
hearing
this
but
hungry
childther
being
called
for
tea
was
from
the
house
across
the
way
and
from
off
yonder
and
may
from
somewhere
else
away
with
yez
all
to
your
mothers
and
patsy
scattered
them
as
if
they
had
been
a
flock
of
young
sheep
scampering
in
all
directions
but
one
there
was
who
lagged
behind
a
little
boy
with
an
old
old
face
who
watched
the
others
go
and
then
crept
closer
held
by
the
spell
of
the
tale
he
pulled
at
patsy
sleeve
to
gain
attention
i
i
joseph
was
it
true
most
of
it
she
nodded
a
reply
as
solemn
as
his
question
aye
as
true
as
youth
and
the
world
itself
and
would
it
come
true
for
another
boy
any
boy
who
went
off
like
that
would
he
find
whatever
he
was
wishin
for
and
even
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
left
hers
and
went
searching
for
the
hills
and
what
might
lie
beyond
come
here
little
lad
patsy
drew
him
to
her
and
put
two
steadying
hands
on
his
shoulders
she
knew
that
he
too
had
heard
the
call
of
the
road
and
the
longing
to
be
gone
to
be
one
with
it
journeying
to
meet
the
mysterious
unknown
was
upon
him
hearken
to
me
is
only
safe
for
a
little
lad
to
be
going
when
he
has
three
things
to
fetch
with
him
the
wish
to
find
something
worth
the
bringing
home
the
knowledge
of
what
makes
good
company
along
the
way
and
trust
in
himself
when
ye
are
sure
of
these
go
but
ye
no
longer
be
a
little
lad
i
thinking
and
remember
first
to
get
the
blessing
and
same
as
jack
a
lad
journey
ends
nowhere
that
begins
without
that
he
went
without
a
word
but
content
and
his
eyes
brimmed
with
visions
patsy
watched
him
tenderly
who
knows
he
may
find
greatness
on
his
road
who
knows
the
tinker
dropped
the
bundle
he
had
brought
back
from
the
store
into
her
lap
but
she
scarcely
heeded
him
her
eyes
were
looking
out
into
the
gathering
dusk
while
her
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
but
i
always
envied
that
piper
fellow
from
hamelin
town
think
of
being
able
to
gather
up
all
the
childther
hereabouts
eager
childther
with
mothers
too
busy
or
deaf
to
heed
them
and
leading
them
away
to
find
their
fortunes
would
that
be
wonderful
just
what
kind
of
fortunes
asked
the
tinker
what
but
the
best
kind
patsy
thought
for
a
moment
and
smiled
whimsically
while
her
eyes
grew
strangely
starry
in
that
early
twilight
would
i
like
to
be
choosing
those
fortunes
and
would
they
be
an
odd
lot
entirely
there
be
singing
hearts
that
had
learned
to
sing
above
trouble
there
be
true
fellowship
the
kind
that
finds
brotherhood
in
beggars
as
well
as
as
prime
ministers
there
be
peace
of
soul
not
the
kind
that
naps
by
the
fire
content
that
the
wind
does
be
blowing
down
his
chimney
but
the
kind
that
fights
above
fighting
and
keeps
neighbor
from
harrying
neighbor
troth
the
world
is
in
mortial
need
of
fortunes
like
the
last
and
would
you
be
choosin
gold
for
a
fortune
asked
the
tinker
patsy
shook
her
head
vehemently
why
not
that
the
why
suddenly
patsy
clenched
her
hands
and
shook
two
menacing
fists
against
the
gathering
dark
i
hate
gold
along
with
the
meanness
and
the
lying
and
the
thieving
and
the
false
judgment
it
brings
into
the
world
but
the
world
ca
get
along
without
it
reminded
the
tinker
shrewdly
aye
but
it
can
it
can
get
along
without
the
hoarded
gold
the
inherited
gold
the
cheating
bribing
starving
gold
that
the
kind
i
mean
the
kind
that
gets
into
a
man
heart
and
veins
until
his
fingers
itch
to
gild
everything
he
touches
like
the
rich
man
in
the
city
yonder
what
rich
man
i
thought
the
i
thought
the
city
was
full
o
rich
men
maybe
but
there
just
one
i
thinking
of
now
and
god
pity
him
and
his
son
the
tinker
eyed
her
stupidly
how
know
he
has
a
son
patsy
laughed
i
guessed
maybe
then
she
looked
down
in
her
lap
and
here
the
news
with
no
light
left
to
read
it
by
and
i
as
hungry
as
an
alley
cat
and
as
tired
as
two
ye
never
dream
to
hear
me
talking
that
i
never
had
much
more
than
a
crooked
sixpence
to
my
name
since
i
was
born
and
here
i
am
with
that
gone
and
not
a
slither
to
buy
me
bed
or
board
for
the
night
the
tinker
looked
down
at
her
with
an
altogether
strange
expression
very
different
from
anything
patsy
had
seen
on
his
face
all
day
had
she
chanced
to
catch
it
before
it
flickered
out
it
might
have
puzzled
even
her
wits
to
fathom
the
meaning
of
it
for
it
was
as
if
the
two
had
unexpectedly
changed
places
and
the
tender
pity
and
protectiveness
that
had
belonged
to
her
had
suddenly
become
his
never
mind
lass
there
board
in
the
kit
for
what
the
farm
wife
put
up
and
there
this
left
and
i
i
he
did
not
finish
instead
he
dropped
a
few
coins
in
her
hand
the
change
from
the
then
he
set
about
sweeping
the
dust
from
the
step
with
his
battered
cap
and
spreading
their
meager
meal
before
her
they
ate
in
silence
so
deep
in
the
business
of
dulling
their
appetites
that
they
never
noticed
a
small
figure
crossing
the
street
with
two
goblets
and
a
pitcher
hugged
tight
in
his
arms
they
never
looked
up
until
the
things
were
set
down
beside
them
and
a
voice
announced
at
their
elbow
mother
said
i
could
bring
it
it
better
eatin
dry
it
was
joseph
and
the
pitcher
held
milk
still
foamy
from
a
late
milking
he
looked
at
patsy
a
moment
longingly
as
if
there
was
more
he
wanted
to
ask
but
overcome
with
a
sudden
bashful
confusion
he
took
to
his
heels
and
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
before
they
had
time
even
to
give
thanks
the
tinker
poured
the
goblets
full
handed
patsy
to
her
with
another
grave
bow
and
touching
his
to
hers
said
soberly
to
a
friendly
lass
the
first
i
ever
knew
i
reckon
for
an
instant
she
watched
him
puzzled
and
amused
then
she
raised
her
glass
slowly
in
reply
and
here
to
tinkers
the
world
over
when
everything
but
the
crumbs
were
eaten
she
left
him
to
scatter
these
and
return
joseph
pitcher
while
she
went
to
get
the
loan
of
a
light
from
the
shopkeeper
and
hunt
up
the
news
the
store
was
store
and
general
news
center
combined
the
news
was
at
that
very
moment
in
process
of
circulation
among
the
boys
a
quorum
from
the
patriarchs
of
the
town
circling
the
the
storekeeper
himself
topped
it
they
looked
up
as
patsy
entered
and
acknowledged
her
good
evening
with
that
perfect
indifference
the
provincial
cloak
in
habitual
use
for
concealing
the
most
absolute
curiosity
the
storekeeper
graciously
laid
the
hospitality
of
his
stool
and
counter
and
at
her
feet
in
other
words
he
she
was
welcome
to
make
herself
t
home
all
of
which
patsy
accepted
she
spread
out
the
newspaper
on
the
counter
in
front
of
her
she
unwrapped
a
series
of
small
bundles
ink
pen
stamped
envelope
and
and
eyed
them
with
approval
the
tinker
a
wonder
entirely
she
said
to
herself
but
i
would
like
to
be
knowing
did
he
or
did
the
shopkeeper
do
the
choosing
then
she
remembered
the
thing
above
all
others
that
she
needed
to
know
and
swung
about
on
the
stool
to
address
the
quorum
i
say
can
you
tell
me
where
i
be
likely
to
find
a
person
by
the
name
of
bil
william
burgeman
that
rich
feller
boy
patsy
nodded
have
you
seen
him
the
quorum
thumbed
the
armholes
of
their
vests
and
shook
an
emphatic
negative
nope
volunteered
the
storekeeper
too
early
for
him
or
his
sort
to
be
diggin
out
o
winter
quarters
are
you
sure
do
you
know
him
wall
ca
say
exactly
ef
i
know
him
but
i
know
ef
he
been
hangin
round
sartin
hai
been
nothin
like
him
loose
in
these
parts
has
there
boys
the
quorum
confirmed
the
statement
patsy
wrinkled
up
a
perplexed
forehead
that
odd
you
see
he
should
have
been
here
last
night
at
the
latest
i
had
it
from
somebody
who
knew
that
he
was
coming
to
arden
mebby
he
was
drawled
the
storekeeper
while
the
quorum
cackled
in
appreciation
but
this
here
is
a
good
seven
miles
from
arden
patsy
arms
fell
limp
across
the
counter
her
head
followed
and
she
sat
there
a
dejected
little
heap
by
swore
the
storekeeper
she
swoomed
has
she
boys
the
quorum
were
on
the
verge
of
investigating
when
she
denied
the
fact
in
person
where
am
i
in
the
name
of
saint
peter
what
place
is
this
this
why
this
is
lebanon
she
smiled
weakly
lebanon
sounds
more
like
it
anyhow
thank
you
she
turned
about
and
settled
down
to
the
paper
while
the
boys
reverted
to
their
original
topic
of
discussion
there
were
two
items
of
news
that
interested
her
burgeman
senior
was
critically
ill
he
had
been
ill
for
some
time
but
there
had
been
no
cause
for
apprehension
until
the
last
hours
and
marjorie
schuyler
had
left
for
san
francisco
on
the
way
to
china
she
was
to
be
gone
indefinitely
the
heathen
idols
and
the
laundrymen
are
welcome
to
her
growled
patsy
maliciously
if
they
only
fix
her
with
the
evil
eye
or
wish
such
a
homesickness
and
lovesickness
on
her
that
last
for
a
year
and
a
day
i
forgive
her
for
what
she
made
me
wish
on
myself
having
relieved
her
mind
somewhat
she
was
able
to
attend
to
the
business
of
the
letter
with
less
inward
discomfort
the
letter
was
written
to
george
travis
already
known
as
the
manager
of
miss
regis
he
was
the
head
of
a
theatrical
managerial
firm
in
new
york
and
an
old
friend
and
of
patsy
in
it
she
explained
partly
her
continued
sojourn
in
america
and
frankly
confessed
to
her
financial
needs
if
he
had
anything
anywhere
that
she
could
do
until
the
fall
bookings
with
her
own
company
she
would
be
most
humbly
grateful
he
might
address
her
at
arden
she
had
great
hopes
of
reaching
there
some
day
there
was
a
postscript
added
in
good
pure
donegal
and
do
ye
be
afeared
of
hurting
my
pride
by
offering
anything
too
small
just
at
present
i
like
old
granny
donoghue
lean
pig
hungry
for
scrapings
as
she
sealed
the
envelope
a
shadow
fell
athwart
the
counter
patsy
looked
up
to
find
the
tinker
peering
at
her
sharply
you
look
clean
tuckered
out
he
announced
baldly
then
he
laid
a
coaxing
hand
on
her
arm
i
want
you
to
come
along
with
me
will
you
lass
i
found
a
place
for
you
a
nice
place
i
been
talkin
to
joseph
mother
an
she
goin
to
look
after
you
for
the
night
patsy
face
crinkled
up
all
over
the
tinker
could
not
have
told
even
if
he
had
been
in
possession
of
all
his
senses
whether
she
was
going
to
laugh
or
cry
as
it
turned
out
she
did
neither
she
just
sighed
a
tired
contented
little
sigh
slipping
off
the
stool
and
dropping
the
letter
into
the
when
she
faced
the
tinker
again
her
eyes
were
misty
and
for
all
her
courage
she
could
not
keep
the
quivering
from
her
lips
she
reached
up
impulsive
trusting
hands
to
his
shoulders
lad
lad
how
were
ye
ever
guessing
that
i
reached
the
end
o
my
wits
and
was
needing
some
one
to
think
for
me
holy
saint
michael
but
wo
i
be
mortial
glad
to
be
feeling
a
respectable
lebanon
under
me
as
the
tinker
led
her
out
of
the
store
the
quorum
eyed
her
silently
for
a
moment
for
a
brief
space
there
was
a
scraping
of
chairs
and
clearing
of
throats
indicative
of
some
important
comment
what
sort
of
a
lookin
gal
did
that
green
county
sheriff
say
he
was
after
inquired
the
storekeeper
at
last
small
war
it
suggested
one
of
the
quorum
yep
guess
it
was
and
what
sort
o
clothes
did
he
say
she
wore
brown
chorused
the
quorum
wall
boys
the
storekeeper
wagged
an
accusing
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
recently
vacated
stool
she
was
small
war
she
an
she
got
brown
clothes
hai
she
an
she
acts
queer
she
the
quorum
nodded
in
solemn
agreement
but
she
doa
look
like
no
thief
interceded
the
youngest
of
the
boys
he
could
have
been
a
day
over
seventy
and
it
was
more
than
likely
that
he
was
still
susceptible
to
youth
and
beauty
the
rest
glowered
at
him
with
plain
disapproval
while
the
storekeeper
shifted
the
course
of
his
thumb
and
wagged
it
at
him
instead
si
perkins
that
not
for
you
to
say
nor
me
neither
that
up
to
green
county
an
i
i
over
to
the
sheriff
come
mornin
an
tell
him
our
suspicions
by
i
got
to
square
my
conscience
the
quorum
invested
their
thumbs
again
and
cleared
their
throats
vii
the
tinker
plays
a
part
there
is
little
of
the
day
happenings
that
escapes
the
ears
of
a
country
boy
every
small
item
of
local
interest
is
so
much
grist
for
his
mill
and
there
is
no
more
reliable
method
for
a
stranger
to
collect
news
than
a
sociable
game
of
peg
interspersed
with
a
few
casual
but
diplomatic
questions
the
tinker
played
peg
the
night
after
he
and
patsy
reached
lebanon
on
the
barn
floor
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
with
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
thereby
learned
of
the
visit
of
the
sheriff
afterward
he
sawed
and
split
the
apportioned
wood
which
was
to
pay
for
patsy
lodging
and
went
to
sleep
on
the
hay
in
a
state
of
complete
exhaustion
but
for
all
that
patsy
was
wakened
an
hour
before
by
a
shower
of
pebbles
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
porch
just
under
her
window
looking
out
she
spied
him
below
a
silencing
finger
against
his
lips
while
he
waved
a
beckoning
arm
toward
the
road
patsy
dressed
and
slipped
out
without
a
sound
what
has
happened
ye
she
whispered
anxiously
looking
him
well
over
for
some
symptoms
of
sickness
or
trouble
his
only
reply
was
a
mysterious
shake
of
the
head
as
he
led
the
way
down
the
village
street
his
rags
flapping
grotesquely
in
the
dawn
wind
there
was
nothing
for
patsy
to
do
except
to
follow
as
fast
as
she
could
after
his
long
swinging
strides
lebanon
still
slept
in
its
peaceful
respectability
even
the
dogs
failed
to
give
them
a
speeding
bark
they
stole
away
as
silently
as
shadows
and
as
shadows
went
forth
upon
the
open
road
to
meet
the
coming
day
a
mile
beyond
the
township
stone
the
tinker
stopped
to
let
patsy
catch
up
with
him
it
was
a
very
breathless
disgruntled
patsy
now
by
saint
brendan
what
ails
ye
lad
to
be
waking
a
body
up
at
this
time
of
day
do
ye
think
it
good
morals
or
good
manners
to
be
trailing
us
off
on
a
bare
stomach
like
this
as
if
a
county
full
of
constables
was
at
our
heels
what
the
meaning
of
it
and
what
will
the
good
folk
who
cared
for
us
the
night
think
to
find
us
gone
with
never
a
word
of
thanks
or
explanation
the
tinker
scratched
his
chin
meditatively
it
was
marked
by
a
more
growth
than
on
the
previous
morning
which
did
not
enhance
his
comeliness
or
lessen
his
state
of
vagabondage
there
was
something
about
his
appearance
that
made
him
out
less
a
fool
and
more
an
uncouth
rascal
one
might
easily
have
trusted
him
as
well
as
pitied
him
yesterday
but
patsy
gaze
was
critical
and
not
he
saw
her
look
and
met
it
eye
for
eye
only
he
still
fumbled
his
chin
ineffectually
have
you
forgot
he
asked
a
bit
sheepishly
there
were
the
you
said
as
how
you
cared
about
findin
and
they
not
near
so
pretty
an
bright
if
left
standin
too
long
after
the
dew
dries
patsy
pulled
a
wry
little
smile
is
that
so
and
ye
been
after
making
me
trade
a
and
a
good
breakfast
for
for
the
best
color
of
well
if
i
was
dan
instead
of
myself
standing
here
i
be
likely
to
tell
ye
to
go
to
the
devil
aye
help
ye
there
with
my
two
fists
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
all
the
comradeship
faded
quickly
from
her
eyes
the
tinker
said
never
a
word
only
his
lips
parted
in
a
coaxing
smile
which
seemed
to
say
please
go
on
believing
in
me
and
his
eyes
still
held
hers
unwaveringly
and
the
tinker
smile
won
bit
by
bit
patsy
rigid
attitude
of
condemnation
relaxed
the
comradeship
crept
back
in
her
eyes
the
smile
to
her
lips
heigho
is
a
bad
bargain
ye
ca
make
the
best
of
but
mind
one
thing
master
touchstone
ye
find
the
right
road
to
arden
this
time
or
ye
and
the
duke
daughter
will
part
company
for
all
willie
shakespeare
wrote
it
otherwise
he
nodded
we
can
ask
the
way
we
go
but
first
we
be
the
and
some
breakfast
you
see
i
find
them
both
for
you
lass
and
he
set
off
with
his
swinging
stride
straight
across
country
wagging
his
head
wisely
patsy
fell
in
behind
him
and
the
road
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
earshot
it
was
just
about
this
time
that
the
storekeeper
at
lebanon
got
the
green
county
sheriff
on
the
and
squared
his
conscience
i
she
the
guilty
party
were
his
closing
remarks
never
ha
lighted
out
o
this
town
afore
christian
folks
were
out
o
bed
ef
she
had
had
somethin
takin
her
and
what
more
she
keepin
bad
company
and
so
it
came
about
that
all
the
time
the
sorrel
mare
was
being
harnessed
into
the
runabout
the
tinker
was
leading
patsy
farther
afield
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
mare
heels
were
raising
the
dust
on
the
road
between
lebanon
and
arden
they
were
following
a
forest
brook
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods
they
found
it
the
most
cheery
neighborly
and
comfortable
kind
of
a
brook
the
quiet
and
sort
that
one
could
step
at
will
from
bank
to
bank
and
see
with
half
an
eye
what
a
prime
favorite
it
was
among
its
neighbors
patsy
and
the
tinker
marked
how
close
things
huddled
to
it
even
creeping
on
to
cover
stones
and
gravel
stretches
there
were
moss
and
ferns
and
little
clinging
things
like
and
linnea
the
major
part
of
the
bird
population
was
bathing
in
the
sunnier
pools
soberly
or
with
wild
hilarity
according
to
disposition
the
tinker
knew
them
all
calling
to
them
in
friendly
fashion
at
which
they
always
answered
back
patsy
listened
silently
wrapped
in
the
delight
and
beauty
of
it
on
went
the
brook
dancing
here
in
a
broken
patch
of
sunshine
quieting
there
between
the
banks
of
and
columbine
to
better
paint
their
prettiness
and
all
the
while
singing
one
farther
and
farther
into
the
woods
she
was
just
wondering
if
there
could
be
anything
lovelier
than
this
when
the
tinker
stopped
still
and
tense
as
a
pointer
she
craned
her
head
and
looked
beyond
him
looked
to
where
the
woods
broke
leaving
for
a
few
feet
a
thinly
shaded
growth
of
beech
and
maple
the
sunlight
sifted
through
in
great
unbroken
patches
of
gold
falling
on
the
beds
of
fern
and
moss
and
yes
there
they
were
the
promised
a
little
indrawn
sigh
of
ecstasy
from
patsy
caused
the
tinker
to
turn
about
then
you
not
hatin
gold
when
you
find
it
green
he
chuckled
patsy
shook
her
head
with
vehemence
never
and
would
it
be
grand
if
nature
could
be
gathering
it
all
up
from
everywhere
and
spinning
it
over
again
into
the
likes
of
those
in
the
name
o
saint
francis
do
ye
suppose
if
the
english
poets
had
laid
their
two
eyes
to
anything
so
beautiful
as
what
yonder
they
ever
have
gone
so
daffy
over
daffodils
they
never
would
agreed
the
tinker
patsy
studied
him
with
a
sharp
little
look
and
what
do
ye
know
about
english
poets
pray
his
lower
jaw
dropped
in
a
dull
foolish
fashion
nothin
but
i
know
he
explained
at
last
and
at
that
moment
the
call
of
a
thrush
came
to
them
from
just
across
the
glade
patsy
listened
spellbound
while
he
sang
his
bubbling
song
of
gladness
through
half
a
score
of
times
is
it
the
flowers
singing
she
asked
at
last
her
eyes
dancing
mischievously
it
might
be
the
souls
o
the
dead
ones
the
tinker
considered
thoughtfully
a
moment
maybe
the
souls
o
flowers
become
birds
same
as
ours
becomes
angels
would
be
such
a
deal
o
difference
both
takin
to
wings
and
singin
he
chuckled
again
anyhow
that
the
bellbird
and
i
sent
him
word
yesterday
by
one
o
them
finches
to
be
on
hand
just
about
this
time
ye
did
order
a
breakfast
the
same
way
did
ye
the
tinker
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
i
did
then
and
before
patsy
could
strip
her
tongue
of
its
next
teasing
remark
he
had
vanished
as
quickly
and
completely
as
if
magic
had
had
a
hand
in
it
a
crescendo
of
snapping
twigs
and
rustling
leaves
marked
his
going
however
and
patsy
leaped
the
brook
and
settled
herself
tailor
fashion
in
the
midst
of
the
sunshine
and
the
she
unpinned
the
rakish
beaver
and
tossed
it
from
her
off
came
the
norfolk
jacket
and
followed
the
beaver
she
eyed
the
rest
of
her
costume
askance
she
would
have
sorely
liked
to
part
with
that
too
had
she
but
the
lord
assurance
that
he
would
do
as
well
by
her
as
he
had
by
the
lilies
of
the
field
or
the
is
surprising
how
wearisome
the
same
clothes
can
grow
when
on
the
back
of
a
human
being
yet
a
flower
can
wear
them
for
a
thousand
years
or
more
and
ye
never
go
tired
of
them
i
not
knowing
why
but
somehow
i
like
to
be
looking
gladsome
she
stretched
her
arms
wide
for
a
minute
in
a
gesture
of
intense
longing
then
the
glory
of
the
woods
claimed
her
again
and
she
gave
herself
over
completely
to
the
wonder
and
enjoyment
of
them
her
eyes
roamed
about
her
unceasingly
for
every
bit
of
prettiness
her
ears
caught
the
symphony
of
bird
and
brook
and
soughing
wind
so
still
did
she
sit
that
the
tinker
returning
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
had
gone
and
stood
in
the
brakes
laden
to
the
chin
and
covered
with
the
misery
of
poignant
disappointment
for
him
all
the
music
of
the
place
had
turned
to
laughing
discord
until
he
spied
her
i
thought
his
tongue
stumbled
i
was
thinkin
you
had
gone
same
as
you
came
down
the
road
yesterday
he
paused
a
moment
you
would
go
off
by
yourself
and
leave
a
lad
without
you
said
somethin
about
it
first
would
you
i
not
leave
ye
till
we
get
to
arden
an
an
what
then
the
road
must
end
for
me
there
lad
what
i
came
to
do
will
be
done
and
there
be
no
excuse
for
lingering
but
i
not
forget
to
wish
ye
along
your
way
before
i
go
a
sly
look
came
into
the
tinker
eyes
patsy
never
saw
it
for
he
was
bending
close
over
the
huge
basket
he
had
brought
she
only
caught
a
tinge
of
exultation
in
his
voice
as
he
said
then
if
you
promise
your
till
we
fetch
up
in
arden
with
that
he
went
busily
about
preparations
for
breakfast
patsy
watching
him
plainly
astonished
he
gathered
bark
and
brush
and
kindled
a
fire
on
a
large
flat
rock
which
he
had
moved
against
a
boulder
about
it
he
fastened
a
tripod
of
green
saplings
from
which
he
hung
a
filled
from
the
brook
i
praying
there
more
nor
water
in
it
murmured
patsy
and
a
moment
later
as
the
tinker
shook
out
a
small
white
from
the
basket
and
spread
it
at
her
feet
she
clasped
her
hands
and
repeated
with
perfect
faith
goat
bleat
table
get
set
i
smell
the
coffee
out
of
the
basket
came
little
green
dishes
a
pat
of
butter
a
jug
of
cream
a
bowl
of
berries
a
plate
of
biscuits
riz
was
the
tinker
comment
as
he
put
down
the
last
named
and
then
followed
what
appeared
to
patsy
to
be
round
brown
sugared
buns
with
holes
in
them
these
he
passed
twice
under
her
nose
with
a
triumphant
flourish
and
what
might
they
be
her
curiosity
was
reaching
the
if
ye
bring
out
another
thing
from
that
basket
believe
ye
in
league
with
bodh
dearg
himself
or
ye
stolen
the
faeries
trencher
of
plenty
for
reply
the
tinker
dived
once
more
beneath
the
cover
and
brought
out
a
full
of
bacon
and
four
white
eggs
think
whatever
you
mind
to
i
going
to
fry
these
but
after
he
had
raked
over
the
embers
to
his
complete
satisfaction
and
placed
the
pan
on
them
he
came
back
and
picking
up
one
of
the
brown
buns
slipped
it
over
patsy
forefinger
this
is
a
he
announced
soberly
though
most
folks
calls
somethin
different
now
if
you
wish
a
wish
and
eat
it
all
but
the
hole
you
have
what
you
been
wishin
for
all
your
life
how
soon
will
ye
be
having
it
in
as
many
days
as
there
are
bites
so
patsy
bit
while
the
tinker
checked
them
off
on
his
fingers
one
two
three
four
five
six
you
get
your
wish
by
the
seventh
day
sure
or
i
no
tinker
illustration
if
you
wish
a
wish
and
eat
it
all
but
the
hole
you
have
what
you
been
wishin
for
all
your
life
but
are
ye
patsy
shook
the
finger
at
him
accusingly
i
beginning
to
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
ye
a
tinker
at
all
ye
are
foolish
one
minute
and
ye
more
wits
than
i
have
the
next
i
caught
ye
looking
too
lonesome
and
helpless
to
be
allowed
beyond
reach
of
our
mother
and
yet
last
night
and
the
day
ye
taken
care
of
me
as
if
ye
been
hired
out
to
tend
babies
since
ye
were
one
yourself
as
for
your
language
ye
never
speak
twice
the
same
the
tinker
grinned
that
bacon
burnin
i
i
better
turn
it
had
i
i
you
had
and
patsy
grinned
back
at
him
derisively
the
tinker
was
master
of
ceremonies
and
he
served
her
as
any
courtier
might
have
served
his
liege
lady
he
shook
out
the
diminutive
serviette
he
had
brought
for
her
and
spread
it
across
her
lap
he
poured
her
coffee
and
sweetened
it
according
to
direction
he
even
buttered
her
riz
biscuits
and
poured
the
cream
on
her
berries
are
ye
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
duke
daughter
was
helpless
entirely
she
asked
at
length
the
tinker
shook
an
emphatic
negative
i
was
just
thinkin
she
might
like
things
a
mite
decent
onct
in
a
while
lad
lad
who
in
the
wide
world
are
ye
patsy
checked
her
outburst
with
a
warning
hand
no
do
ye
be
telling
me
ye
could
turn
out
anything
better
nor
a
tinker
and
i
rather
keep
ye
as
i
found
ye
so
if
ye
have
a
secret
mind
it
well
and
do
ye
be
letting
it
loose
to
scare
the
two
of
us
into
conventional
folk
play
willie
shakespeare
comedy
to
the
end
of
the
road
please
god
amen
agreed
the
tinker
devoutly
as
he
threw
her
portion
of
fried
eggs
neatly
out
of
the
pan
into
her
plate
it
was
not
until
she
was
served
that
he
looked
after
his
own
wants
then
they
ate
in
silence
both
too
hungry
and
too
full
of
their
own
thoughts
to
loosen
their
tongues
once
the
tinker
broke
the
silence
your
wish
what
was
it
he
asked
that
telling
said
patsy
but
if
ye
confess
to
where
ye
came
by
this
heavenly
meal
i
might
confess
to
the
wish
he
rubbed
his
chin
solemnly
for
an
instant
then
he
beamed
tell
ye
i
picked
it
off
o
the
and
brambles
as
i
came
along
of
course
ye
did
agreed
patsy
with
fine
sarcasm
and
for
my
wish
i
was
after
thinking
i
marry
the
king
son
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
teasing
saucy
stare
of
two
children
then
they
laughed
as
and
as
merrily
maybe
you
get
your
wish
he
suggested
soberly
maybe
i
will
agreed
patsy
with
mock
solemnity
a
look
of
shrewdness
sprang
into
the
tinker
face
but
you
said
you
hated
gold
you
could
marry
a
king
son
havin
gold
lots
of
it
aye
but
i
could
could
i
be
making
him
throw
it
away
before
ever
i
marry
him
and
patsy
clapped
her
hands
triumphantly
an
you
marry
him
poor
the
tinker
eyes
kindled
suddenly
as
he
asked
it
for
all
the
world
as
if
her
answer
might
have
a
meaning
for
him
patsy
never
noticed
she
was
looking
past
him
into
the
indistinguishable
beyond
sure
we
would
be
poor
we
be
blessed
with
nothing
that
all
for
those
golden
moments
of
romancing
patsy
quest
was
forgotten
they
might
have
reached
arden
and
despatched
her
errand
for
all
the
worriment
their
loitering
caused
her
as
for
the
tinker
if
he
had
either
a
mission
or
a
destination
he
gave
no
sign
for
her
to
reckon
by
they
dallied
over
the
breakfast
they
dallied
over
the
aftermath
of
picking
up
and
putting
away
and
stamping
out
the
charred
twigs
and
embers
and
then
they
dallied
over
the
memory
of
it
all
patsy
spun
a
hundred
threads
of
fancy
into
tales
about
the
forest
while
the
tinker
called
the
thickets
about
them
full
of
birds
and
whistled
their
songs
antiphonally
with
them
do
ye
know
said
patsy
with
a
deep
sigh
i
happier
than
ye
can
tell
me
and
twice
as
happy
as
i
can
tell
ye
an
this
hereabouts
would
make
a
bad
castle
suggested
the
tinker
irrelevantly
what
patsy
might
have
answered
is
not
recorded
for
they
both
happened
to
look
up
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
space
and
saw
that
the
sky
above
their
heads
had
grown
a
dull
leaden
color
they
were
no
longer
sitting
in
the
midst
of
sunlight
the
had
lost
their
golden
radiance
the
brook
sounded
plaintive
and
melancholy
and
from
the
woods
fringing
the
open
came
the
call
of
the
he
singin
for
rain
wo
hurt
a
mite
if
we
make
toward
some
shelter
the
tinker
pulled
patsy
to
her
feet
and
gathered
up
the
basket
and
hurry
said
patsy
with
a
strange
little
twisted
smile
on
her
lips
of
course
i
was
knowing
like
all
faery
tales
it
had
to
have
an
ending
but
i
want
to
remember
it
just
as
we
found
it
first
sprinkled
with
sunshine
and
not
turning
dull
and
gray
like
this
she
started
plunging
through
the
woods
and
the
tinker
was
obliged
to
turn
her
about
and
set
her
going
right
with
the
final
instruction
to
follow
her
nose
and
he
would
catch
up
with
her
before
she
had
caught
up
with
it
she
had
reached
the
road
however
and
thunder
was
grumbling
uncomfortably
near
when
the
tinker
joined
her
it
goin
to
be
a
soaker
he
announced
cheerfully
then
we
better
tramp
fast
as
we
can
and
ask
the
first
person
we
pass
are
we
on
the
right
road
to
arden
they
tramped
but
they
passed
no
one
the
road
was
surprisingly
barren
of
shelters
and
strangely
enough
of
the
two
houses
they
saw
one
was
temporarily
deserted
and
the
other
unoccupied
the
wind
came
with
the
breaking
of
the
storm
that
cold
piercing
wind
that
often
comes
in
june
as
a
reminder
that
winter
has
not
passed
by
so
very
long
before
it
whipped
the
rain
across
their
faces
and
cut
down
their
headway
until
it
seemed
to
patsy
as
if
they
barely
crawled
they
came
to
a
barn
but
she
was
too
cold
and
wet
to
stop
where
there
was
no
fire
any
place
that
warm
she
shouted
across
to
the
tinker
and
he
shouted
back
as
they
rounded
the
bend
of
the
road
see
there
it
is
at
last
the
sight
of
a
house
ahead
whose
active
chimney
gave
good
evidence
of
a
fire
within
spurred
patsy
lagging
steps
but
in
response
to
their
knocking
the
door
was
opened
just
wide
enough
to
frame
the
narrow
face
of
a
nervous
woman
who
bade
them
be
gone
even
before
they
had
gathered
breath
enough
to
ask
for
shelter
faith
is
a
reminder
that
we
are
no
longer
living
three
hundred
years
ago
patsy
murmured
between
tightening
lips
how
long
in
do
ye
think
the
fashion
has
been
to
shut
doors
on
poor
wanderers
at
the
next
house
a
beyond
they
fared
no
better
the
woman
voice
was
curter
and
the
uninviting
muzzle
of
a
was
thrust
out
between
the
door
and
the
woman
skirts
as
they
turned
away
patsy
teeth
were
chattering
the
chill
and
wet
had
crept
into
her
bones
and
blood
turning
her
lips
blue
and
her
cheeks
ashen
even
the
cutting
wind
failed
to
color
them
curse
them
muttered
the
tinker
fiercely
if
i
only
had
a
coat
to
put
around
you
anything
to
break
the
wind
curse
them
warm
and
dry
inside
there
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
forbidden
door
patsy
tried
to
smile
but
failed
faith
i
have
the
breath
to
curse
them
but
god
pity
them
that
all
before
she
had
finished
the
tinker
had
a
firm
grip
of
her
arm
hang
it
if
no
one
will
take
us
in
we
break
in
cheer
up
lass
have
you
by
a
crackling
good
fire
if
i
have
to
steal
the
wood
he
hurried
her
along
somewhere
weariness
and
bodily
depression
closed
her
eyes
and
she
let
him
lead
her
whither
she
neither
wondered
nor
cared
time
and
distance
ceased
to
exist
for
her
she
stumbled
along
conscious
of
but
two
things
a
fear
that
she
would
be
ill
again
with
no
one
to
tend
her
and
a
gigantic
craving
for
heat
heat
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
they
had
stopped
and
were
standing
under
a
shuttered
window
at
what
appeared
to
be
the
back
of
a
summer
cottage
the
tinker
was
prying
a
rock
out
of
the
mud
at
their
feet
in
a
most
manner
he
used
it
to
smash
the
fastening
of
the
shutters
and
when
these
were
removed
to
break
the
small
leaded
pane
of
glass
nearest
the
it
was
only
a
matter
of
seconds
then
before
the
window
was
opened
and
patsy
boosted
over
the
sill
into
the
kitchen
beyond
ye
best
stand
me
in
the
sink
and
wring
me
out
or
i
flood
the
house
patsy
managed
to
gasp
i
do
it
myself
but
i
know
if
i
once
let
go
of
my
hands
i
shake
to
death
the
tinker
followed
her
advice
working
the
water
out
of
her
dripping
garments
in
much
the
same
fashion
that
he
would
have
employed
had
she
been
a
cat
in
spite
of
her
numbness
patsy
saw
the
grim
humor
of
it
all
and
came
perilously
near
to
a
hysterical
laugh
the
tinker
unconsciously
forestalled
it
by
shouldering
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
whole
bag
of
cats
and
carrying
her
up
the
stairs
after
looking
into
three
rooms
he
deposited
her
on
the
threshold
of
a
fourth
it
has
the
look
of
women
folks
you
sure
to
find
some
clothes
o
theirs
hanging
up
somewhere
come
down
when
you
dry
i
have
that
fire
waiting
for
you
what
followed
was
all
a
dream
to
patsy
benumbed
senses
the
search
in
drawers
and
closets
for
things
to
put
on
and
the
finding
of
them
the
insistent
aching
of
fingers
and
arms
in
trying
to
adjust
them
and
the
persistent
refusal
of
brain
to
direct
them
with
any
degree
of
intelligence
she
came
down
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
later
dragging
a
bundle
of
wet
clothes
after
her
and
found
the
tinker
kneeling
by
the
hearth
still
in
his
dripping
rags
and
heaping
more
logs
on
the
already
blazing
fire
he
rose
as
she
came
toward
him
took
the
clothes
from
her
and
dropped
them
on
the
hearth
he
seemed
decidedly
hazy
and
remote
as
he
brought
a
steamer
rug
from
somewhere
and
wrapped
it
about
her
his
voice
as
he
coaxed
her
over
to
the
couch
apparently
came
from
miles
away
as
patsy
sank
down
too
weary
to
speak
the
figure
above
her
took
upon
itself
once
more
that
suggestion
of
unearthliness
that
it
had
worn
when
she
had
discovered
it
at
dawn
hanging
to
the
stump
fencing
for
an
instant
the
glow
of
the
fire
threw
the
profile
into
the
same
shadowy
outlines
that
the
rising
sun
had
first
marked
for
her
and
the
image
lingered
even
after
her
eyes
had
closed
sure
he
fading
away
like
oisiu
gearoidh
iarla
and
all
of
them
in
the
old
tales
she
thought
drowsily
like
as
not
when
i
open
my
eyes
again
he
be
clear
gone
this
was
where
the
dream
ended
and
complete
oblivion
began
how
long
it
lasted
she
could
not
have
told
she
only
knew
she
was
awake
at
last
and
acutely
conscious
of
everything
about
her
and
that
she
was
warm
warm
warm
the
room
was
dark
except
for
the
firelight
but
whether
it
was
evening
or
night
or
midnight
she
could
not
have
guessed
she
found
herself
speculating
in
a
hazy
fashion
where
she
was
whose
house
they
had
broken
into
and
what
the
tinker
had
done
with
himself
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
she
ought
to
be
disturbed
over
something
her
complete
isolation
with
a
strange
companion
on
a
night
like
this
but
the
physical
contentment
the
reaction
from
bodily
torture
drugged
her
sensibilities
she
closed
her
eyes
lazily
again
and
listened
to
the
wind
howling
outside
with
the
accompaniment
of
beating
rain
she
was
content
to
revel
in
that
feeling
of
luxury
that
only
the
snugly
housed
can
know
a
sound
in
the
room
roused
her
she
opened
her
eyes
as
lazily
as
she
had
closed
them
expecting
to
find
the
tinker
there
replenishing
the
fire
instead
she
sat
up
with
a
jerk
speechless
rubbing
her
eyes
with
two
excited
fists
intent
on
proving
the
unreality
of
what
she
had
seen
but
when
she
looked
again
there
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
immaculate
in
white
summer
flannels
the
blood
rushed
to
patsy
face
mortification
dread
sank
into
her
very
soul
the
drug
of
physical
contentment
had
lost
its
power
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
dominated
by
the
dictates
of
convention
she
cursed
her
irresponsible
love
of
vagabondage
along
with
her
freedom
of
speech
and
manner
and
her
lack
of
conservative
judgment
these
had
played
her
false
and
shamed
her
womanhood
the
patsys
of
this
world
are
not
given
to
trading
on
their
charm
or
powers
of
attraction
to
win
men
to
them
it
is
against
their
creed
of
true
womanhood
moreover
a
man
counts
no
more
than
a
woman
in
their
sum
total
of
daily
pleasure
and
when
they
choose
a
comrade
it
is
for
human
qualities
not
sexualities
and
because
of
this
this
particular
patsy
felt
the
more
intensely
the
humiliation
and
challenge
of
the
moment
she
hated
herself
she
hated
the
man
whoever
he
might
be
she
hated
the
tinker
for
his
share
in
it
all
anger
loosened
her
tongue
at
last
who
in
the
name
of
saint
bridget
are
ye
she
demanded
and
the
man
in
white
flannels
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
viii
when
two
were
not
company
the
laughter
would
have
proved
contagious
to
any
except
one
in
patsy
humor
and
as
laughing
alone
is
sorry
business
the
man
soon
sobered
and
looked
over
at
patsy
with
the
merriment
lingering
only
in
his
eyes
by
willie
shakespeare
it
the
duke
daughter
in
truth
the
words
made
little
impression
on
her
it
was
the
laugh
and
voice
that
puzzled
her
they
were
unmistakably
the
tinker
but
there
was
nothing
familiar
about
face
figure
or
expression
although
patsy
studied
them
hard
to
find
some
trace
of
the
man
she
had
been
journeying
with
with
a
final
bewildered
shake
of
the
head
her
eyes
met
his
coldly
mockingly
my
name
is
patricia
her
voice
was
crisp
and
tart
it
the
irish
for
a
short
temper
and
a
hot
one
now
maybe
you
will
have
the
grace
to
favor
me
with
yours
just
the
tinker
he
complied
amiably
and
very
much
at
your
service
this
was
accompanied
by
a
sweeping
bow
patsy
had
marked
that
bow
on
two
previous
occasions
and
it
testified
undeniably
to
the
man
identity
yet
patsy
mind
balked
at
accepting
it
it
was
too
galling
to
her
pride
too
slanderous
of
her
past
judgment
and
perceptibilities
a
sudden
rush
of
anger
brought
her
to
her
feet
and
coming
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
she
faced
him
flushed
determined
and
very
dignified
it
is
to
be
doubted
if
patsy
could
have
sustained
the
latter
with
any
degree
of
conviction
if
she
could
have
seen
herself
straying
strands
of
still
damp
hair
curled
bewitchingly
about
her
face
bringing
out
the
roundness
of
cheek
and
chin
and
the
curious
guileless
expression
of
her
eyes
moreover
the
coquettish
gown
she
wore
was
entrancing
it
was
a
light
blue
tunic
affair
with
wide
baby
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
roman
girdle
and
she
had
found
stockings
to
match
with
white
buckskin
pumps
it
had
been
blind
chance
on
her
part
this
making
of
a
toilet
but
the
effect
was
none
the
less
adorable
and
condemning
to
dignity
this
was
evidently
appreciated
by
the
tinker
for
his
face
was
an
odd
mixture
of
grotesque
solemnity
and
keen
enjoyment
patsy
was
altogether
too
flustered
to
diagnose
his
expression
but
it
added
considerably
to
the
temperature
of
the
temper
in
view
of
the
civilized
surroundings
and
her
state
of
dignity
patsy
had
taken
to
king
english
with
barely
a
hint
of
her
native
brogue
if
you
are
the
tinker
and
i
presume
you
are
i
should
very
much
appreciate
an
explanation
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
happened
to
be
hanging
onto
that
stump
in
rags
and
looking
when
i
when
i
came
by
why
just
because
i
was
a
tinker
he
laughed
then
what
are
you
now
once
a
tinker
always
a
tinker
i
just
a
good
to
mend
other
people
broken
pots
and
little
else
knowing
more
about
birds
than
human
beings
and
poor
company
for
any
one
saving
the
very
patsy
stamped
her
foot
why
ca
you
play
fair
is
it
only
decent
to
tell
who
you
are
and
what
you
were
doing
on
the
road
when
i
found
you
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
i
was
doing
hanging
onto
the
stump
and
trying
to
gather
my
wits
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
nicer
if
you
talked
irish
it
does
make
a
lad
feel
half
as
comfortable
or
as
much
at
home
when
he
is
addressed
in
such
perfect
english
patsy
snorted
in
a
minute
i
not
be
addressing
you
at
all
do
you
think
if
i
had
known
you
were
what
you
are
i
would
ever
have
been
so
so
brazen
as
to
ask
for
your
company
and
tramp
along
with
you
for
days
or
be
here
now
oh
she
finished
with
a
groan
and
a
fierce
clenching
of
her
fists
no
i
do
think
so
that
why
i
did
hurry
about
gathering
up
the
wits
it
seemed
more
sociable
without
them
i
would
have
bothered
with
them
now
only
i
could
stay
in
those
rags
any
longer
it
would
have
been
kind
to
the
furniture
or
the
people
who
own
it
these
togs
were
the
only
things
that
came
anywhere
near
to
fitting
me
and
somehow
a
beard
did
match
them
lucky
for
me
heaven
blessed
the
house
with
a
good
razor
and
presto
when
the
beard
and
the
rags
were
gone
the
wits
came
back
awfully
sorry
if
you
do
like
them
the
wits
i
mean
sure
ye
must
be
unconsciously
patsy
had
stepped
back
onto
her
native
sod
and
her
tongue
fairly
dripped
with
irony
so
ye
thought
ye
have
a
morsel
o
fun
at
the
expense
of
a
strange
lass
while
ye
laughed
up
your
sleeve
at
how
clever
ye
were
see
here
do
be
too
hard
please
that
foolishness
was
real
enough
i
had
just
been
knocked
over
the
head
by
the
kind
gentleman
from
whom
i
borrowed
the
rags
i
paid
him
a
tidy
sum
for
the
use
of
them
and
evidently
he
thought
it
was
a
shame
to
leave
me
burdened
with
the
balance
of
my
money
arguing
would
have
done
any
good
so
he
took
the
simplest
way
just
sandbagged
me
and
was
it
much
money
mercy
no
just
a
few
dollars
hardly
worth
the
anæsthesia
and
ye
were
then
half
a
bare
sixteenth
it
was
until
afternoon
until
we
reached
the
church
at
the
that
i
really
came
into
full
possession
the
sentence
trailed
off
into
an
inexplicable
grin
and
after
that
was
i
played
the
fool
patsy
eyes
kindled
the
tinker
grew
serious
he
dug
his
hands
deep
into
his
capacious
white
flannels
as
if
he
were
very
much
in
earnest
ca
you
understand
if
i
had
played
foolish
you
would
never
have
let
me
wander
with
you
you
just
said
so
i
knew
that
and
i
was
selfish
lonely
and
i
did
want
to
give
you
up
you
ca
blame
me
when
a
man
meets
with
genuine
comradeship
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
kind
he
has
always
wanted
but
has
grown
to
believe
exist
he
bound
to
win
a
crumb
of
it
for
himself
it
costs
no
more
than
a
trick
of
foolishness
surely
you
understand
oh
i
understand
i
understanding
more
and
more
every
minute
is
the
gift
of
your
tongue
i
thinking
and
i
wondering
which
of
us
will
be
finding
it
the
pleasantest
she
flashed
a
look
of
unutterable
scorn
upon
him
if
ye
were
not
would
ye
mind
telling
me
how
we
came
to
be
taking
the
wrong
road
at
the
church
the
tinker
choked
aye
i
thought
so
ye
lied
to
me
no
not
exactly
you
see
he
floundered
helplessly
faith
do
send
a
lie
to
mend
a
lie
is
poor
business
i
can
promise
ye
well
the
tinker
tone
grew
dogged
was
it
such
a
heinous
sin
after
all
to
want
to
keep
you
with
me
a
little
longer
the
fire
in
patsy
eyes
leaped
forth
at
last
sin
did
ye
say
faith
is
the
wrong
name
ye
given
it
entirely
was
amusement
ye
meant
the
fun
of
trading
on
a
girl
ignorance
and
the
trick
of
getting
the
good
makings
of
a
tale
to
tell
afterward
to
other
fine
gentlemen
like
yourself
so
you
think
aye
i
think
was
a
joke
with
ye
from
first
to
last
maybe
ye
made
a
wager
with
some
one
or
ye
were
dared
to
take
to
the
road
in
rags
or
ye
did
it
for
copy
ye
not
the
first
man
who
has
done
the
like
for
the
sake
of
a
new
idea
for
a
story
was
a
pity
though
ye
could
have
got
what
ye
wanted
without
making
a
girl
pay
with
her
the
tinker
winced
reaching
out
a
deprecatory
hand
you
are
wrong
no
one
has
paid
such
a
price
there
are
some
natures
so
clear
and
fine
that
chance
and
extremity
can
put
them
anywhere
in
any
company
without
taking
one
whit
from
their
fineness
or
leaving
one
atom
of
smirch
do
you
think
i
would
have
brought
you
here
and
risked
your
trust
and
censorship
of
my
honor
if
you
had
not
been
what
you
are
a
decent
man
has
as
much
as
a
decent
woman
and
the
same
wish
to
keep
it
but
patsy
comprehension
was
strangely
deaf
is
easy
enough
trimming
up
poor
actions
with
grand
words
have
been
no
need
of
risking
anything
if
ye
had
set
me
on
the
right
road
this
morning
i
would
have
been
in
arden
now
where
i
belong
but
that
was
your
way
was
a
grand
scheme
ye
had
whatever
it
might
be
and
ye
fetch
me
away
afore
the
town
is
up
and
i
can
ask
the
road
of
any
one
and
ye
coax
me
across
pastures
and
woods
a
far
cry
from
passing
folk
and
reliable
information
and
ye
hold
me
loitering
the
day
through
till
ye
have
me
forgetting
entirely
why
i
came
along
with
the
promise
laid
on
me
and
the
other
poor
lad
heaven
help
him
oho
the
tinker
whistled
unconsciously
oho
mimicked
patsy
and
is
there
anything
so
wonderfully
strange
in
a
lass
looking
after
a
lad
sure
i
hating
myself
for
not
minding
his
need
better
and
holy
saint
michael
how
i
hating
ye
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
stairway
the
tinker
was
after
her
in
a
twinkling
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
before
she
was
at
the
top
please
please
wait
a
minute
he
pleaded
if
there
another
lad
a
lad
you
love
that
i
have
kept
you
from
then
i
hate
myself
as
much
as
you
do
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
did
think
did
guess
and
i
no
end
sorry
patsy
leaned
over
the
banisters
and
looked
down
at
him
through
eyes
unmistakably
wet
what
does
it
matter
to
ye
if
he
the
lad
i
love
or
not
and
ca
a
body
do
a
kindness
for
a
lad
without
loving
him
thank
heaven
she
can
you
have
taught
me
that
miracle
and
i
believe
the
other
lad
will
grudge
me
these
few
hours
even
if
you
do
who
knows
my
need
may
have
been
as
great
as
his
patsy
frowned
all
ye
needed
was
something
soft
to
dull
your
wits
on
what
he
needing
is
a
father
and
mother
and
sweetheart
and
some
good
bonds
of
human
trust
the
tinker
folded
his
arms
over
the
and
smiled
and
do
you
expect
to
be
able
to
supply
them
all
god
forbid
patsy
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
and
the
tinker
scoring
a
point
took
courage
and
went
on
do
you
suppose
i
realize
that
you
have
given
me
the
finest
gift
a
stranger
can
have
the
gift
of
honest
unconditional
friendship
asking
no
questions
demanding
no
returns
it
is
a
rare
gift
for
any
man
and
i
want
to
keep
it
as
rare
and
beautiful
as
when
it
was
given
so
please
do
mar
it
for
me
now
please
his
hands
went
out
in
earnest
appeal
the
anger
was
leaving
patsy
face
already
the
look
of
comradeship
was
coming
back
in
her
eyes
her
lips
were
beginning
to
curve
in
the
old
whimsical
smile
and
the
tinker
seeing
doubled
his
courage
now
wo
you
please
forgive
me
and
come
down
and
get
some
supper
she
hesitated
and
seeing
that
her
decision
was
hanging
in
the
balance
he
recklessly
tried
his
hand
at
tipping
the
scales
in
his
favor
i
no
end
of
a
good
forager
and
i
rooted
out
lots
of
things
in
tins
and
jars
you
must
be
awfully
hungry
remember
hours
since
our
magical
breakfast
with
the
patsy
fist
banged
the
railing
with
a
startling
thud
i
never
break
fast
with
ye
again
never
never
never
ye
blighted
the
greenest
memory
i
ever
had
and
with
that
she
was
gone
slamming
the
door
after
her
by
way
of
dramatic
emphasis
it
was
a
forlorn
and
dejected
tinker
that
returned
alone
to
the
empty
hearthside
the
bright
cheer
of
the
fire
had
gone
the
room
had
become
a
place
of
shadows
and
haunting
memories
for
a
long
time
he
stood
brutally
kicking
one
of
the
and
snapping
his
fingers
at
his
feelings
and
then
being
a
man
and
requiring
food
he
went
out
into
the
pantry
where
he
had
been
busily
preparing
to
set
forth
the
hospitality
of
the
house
when
patsy
had
wakened
but
before
he
ate
he
found
a
tray
and
covered
it
with
the
best
the
pantry
afforded
he
mounted
the
stairs
with
it
in
rather
a
lagging
fashion
being
wholly
at
sea
concerning
the
temperature
of
his
reception
his
conscience
finally
compromised
with
his
courage
and
he
put
the
tray
down
outside
patsy
door
it
was
not
until
he
was
down
the
stairs
again
that
he
called
out
bravely
oh
i
say
miss
you
better
change
your
mind
and
eat
something
he
waited
a
good
many
minutes
for
an
answer
but
it
came
at
last
the
voice
sounded
broken
and
wistful
as
a
crying
child
thank
you
and
then
could
ye
be
after
telling
me
how
far
it
is
from
here
to
arden
let
me
see
about
seven
miles
and
the
tinker
laughed
he
could
not
help
it
the
next
instant
patsy
door
opened
with
a
jerk
and
the
tray
was
precipitated
down
the
stairs
upon
him
it
was
the
conclusive
evidence
of
the
temper
but
the
tinker
never
knew
that
patsy
wept
herself
remorsefully
to
sleep
and
patsy
never
knew
that
the
last
thing
the
tinker
did
that
night
was
to
cut
a
bedraggled
brown
coat
and
skirt
and
hat
into
strips
and
burn
them
bit
by
bit
it
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
ceremony
the
smell
of
burning
wool
is
not
incense
to
one
nostrils
and
the
tinker
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
as
the
last
flare
died
down
into
a
heap
of
black
smudgy
embers
that
green
county
sheriff
will
have
a
long
way
to
go
now
if
still
looking
for
a
girl
in
a
brown
suit
he
chuckled
sleep
laid
the
temper
when
patsy
awoke
her
eyes
were
as
serene
as
the
patches
of
june
sky
framed
by
her
windows
and
she
felt
at
peace
with
the
world
and
all
the
tinkers
in
it
be
flattering
the
lad
too
much
entirely
to
make
up
with
him
before
breakfast
but
i
be
letting
him
tramp
the
road
to
arden
with
me
and
we
part
there
good
friends
troth
maybe
he
was
a
bit
lonesome
she
added
by
way
of
concession
she
sprang
out
of
bed
with
a
glad
little
laugh
the
day
had
a
grand
beginning
spilling
sunshine
and
into
every
corner
of
her
room
and
to
patsy
optimistic
soul
a
good
beginning
insured
a
better
ending
as
she
dressed
she
planned
that
ending
to
her
own
liking
and
according
to
the
most
approved
rules
of
dramatic
construction
the
tinker
should
turn
out
a
wandering
genius
for
in
her
heart
she
could
not
believe
the
accusations
she
had
hurled
against
him
the
night
past
when
they
reached
arden
they
would
come
upon
the
younger
burgeman
contemplating
immediate
suicide
this
would
give
her
her
cue
and
she
would
administer
trust
and
a
general
bracer
with
one
hand
as
she
removed
the
revolver
with
the
other
in
gratitude
he
would
divulge
the
truth
about
the
forgery
he
did
it
to
save
the
honor
of
some
lady
after
which
the
tinker
would
sponsor
him
tramping
him
off
on
the
road
to
take
the
taste
of
gold
out
of
his
mouth
and
teach
him
the
real
meaning
of
life
patsy
had
no
difficulty
with
her
construction
until
she
came
to
the
final
curtain
here
she
hesitated
she
might
trail
off
to
find
king
midas
and
square
billy
with
him
or
the
curtain
might
drop
leaving
her
right
center
wishing
both
lads
neither
ending
was
entirely
satisfactory
however
the
mental
effect
of
the
tinker
going
off
with
some
one
else
albeit
it
was
another
lad
was
anything
but
satisfying
the
house
was
strangely
quiet
patsy
stopped
frequently
in
her
playmaking
to
listen
for
some
sounds
of
human
occupancy
other
than
her
own
but
there
was
none
poor
lad
maybe
i
killed
him
last
night
when
i
kicked
the
down
the
stairs
after
him
or
most
likely
the
temper
has
him
stiffened
out
with
fear
so
he
dare
move
hand
or
foot
a
moment
later
she
came
down
the
stairs
humming
blow
blow
thou
winter
wind
her
eyes
dancing
riotously
now
by
all
rights
dramatic
or
otherwise
the
tinker
should
have
been
on
hand
waiting
her
entrance
but
tinker
there
was
none
nothing
but
emptiness
and
a
spread
and
ready
for
her
in
the
pantry
curiosity
uneasiness
mastered
her
pride
and
she
called
once
twice
several
times
but
there
came
no
answering
sound
save
the
quickening
of
her
own
under
the
pressure
of
her
held
breath
she
was
alone
in
the
house
a
feeling
of
unutterable
loneliness
swept
over
patsy
she
came
back
to
the
stairs
and
stood
with
her
hands
clasping
the
for
all
the
world
like
a
shipwrecked
maiden
clinging
to
the
last
spar
of
the
ship
no
she
did
not
believe
a
shipwrecked
person
could
feel
more
deserted
more
left
behind
than
she
did
moreover
it
was
an
easier
task
to
face
the
inevitable
when
it
took
the
form
of
blind
impersonal
disaster
when
it
was
a
matter
of
deliberate
intentional
human
motives
it
became
unbearable
had
the
tinker
gone
to
be
rid
of
her
company
and
her
temper
had
he
decided
that
the
road
was
a
better
place
without
her
maybe
he
had
taken
the
matter
of
the
other
lad
too
seriously
and
thinking
them
sweethearts
had
counted
himself
an
undesired
third
and
betaken
himself
out
of
their
ways
or
maybe
he
was
fearsome
of
constables
and
had
hurried
away
to
cover
his
trail
and
leave
her
safe
maybe
a
hundred
things
moaned
patsy
disconsolately
maybe
is
all
a
dream
and
there
no
road
and
no
quest
and
no
rich
man
son
and
no
tinker
and
no
anything
maybe
i
be
waking
up
in
another
minute
and
finding
myself
back
in
the
hospital
with
the
delirium
still
on
me
she
closed
her
eyes
rubbed
them
hard
with
two
mandatory
fists
then
opened
them
to
test
the
truth
of
her
last
remark
and
it
happened
that
the
first
object
they
fell
on
was
a
photograph
in
a
carved
wooden
frame
on
the
in
the
room
across
the
hall
it
was
plainly
visible
from
where
patsy
stood
by
the
stairs
it
was
also
plainly
familiar
with
a
run
patsy
was
over
there
in
an
instant
the
photograph
in
her
hands
holy
saint
patrick
is
witchcraft
she
cried
under
her
breath
how
in
the
name
of
devils
or
saints
did
he
ever
get
this
taken
developed
printed
and
framed
between
the
middle
of
last
night
and
the
beginning
of
this
morning
for
patsy
was
looking
down
at
a
picture
of
the
tinker
in
white
flannels
with
head
thrown
back
and
laughing
ix
patsy
acquires
some
information
with
the
realization
that
the
tinker
was
gone
the
empty
house
suddenly
became
oppressive
patsy
put
down
the
photograph
with
a
quick
little
sigh
and
hunted
up
the
he
had
left
spread
and
ready
for
her
carrying
it
out
to
the
back
porch
there
in
the
open
and
the
sunshine
she
ate
according
to
her
own
tabulation
three
meals
a
supper
a
breakfast
and
the
lunch
which
she
was
more
than
likely
to
miss
later
she
was
in
the
midst
of
the
lunch
when
an
idea
scuttled
out
of
her
inner
consciousness
and
pulled
at
her
immediate
attention
she
rose
hurriedly
and
went
inside
room
after
room
she
searched
closet
after
closet
in
one
she
came
upon
a
suit
of
familiar
white
flannels
and
she
passed
them
slowly
so
slowly
that
her
hands
brushed
them
with
a
friendly
little
greeting
but
the
search
was
a
barren
one
and
she
returned
to
the
porch
as
and
as
mystified
as
she
had
left
it
the
heap
of
ashes
on
the
hearth
held
no
meaning
for
her
and
consequently
told
no
tales
is
plain
enough
what
happened
she
said
soberly
to
the
sparrows
who
were
skirmishing
for
crumbs
just
as
i
said
he
was
fearsome
of
those
constables
after
all
and
he
escaped
in
my
clothes
the
picture
of
the
tinker
bulk
trying
to
disguise
itself
behind
anything
so
scanty
as
her
shrunken
garments
proved
too
irresistible
for
her
sense
of
humor
she
burst
into
peal
after
peal
of
laughter
which
left
her
weak
and
and
dispelled
her
loneliness
like
fog
before
a
clearing
wind
anyhow
if
he
has
worn
them
he
fetched
them
away
as
a
wee
souvenir
of
an
and
if
i
to
reach
arden
in
any
degree
of
decency
have
to
be
in
stolen
clothes
but
she
did
not
go
in
the
blue
frock
the
realization
came
to
her
promptly
that
that
was
no
attire
for
the
road
and
an
unprotected
state
she
must
go
with
dull
plumage
and
no
beguiling
feathers
so
she
searched
again
and
came
upon
a
middy
suit
and
a
norfolk
the
exchange
brought
forth
the
veriest
wisp
of
a
sigh
for
a
woman
a
woman
on
the
road
or
off
it
and
what
one
has
not
a
marked
preference
for
the
more
becoming
frock
patsy
proved
herself
a
most
lawful
housebreaker
she
tidied
up
and
put
away
everything
and
the
shutter
having
already
been
replaced
over
the
broken
window
by
the
runaway
tinker
she
turned
the
knob
of
the
yale
lock
on
the
front
door
and
put
one
foot
over
the
threshold
it
was
back
again
in
an
instant
however
and
this
time
it
was
no
lawful
patsy
that
flew
back
through
the
hall
to
the
with
the
deftness
and
celerity
of
a
true
housebreaker
she
the
tinker
and
stuffed
the
photograph
in
the
pocket
of
her
stolen
norfolk
sure
he
promised
his
company
to
arden
she
said
by
way
of
stilling
her
conscience
then
she
crossed
the
threshold
again
and
this
time
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
sun
was
inconsiderately
overhead
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
where
it
had
risen
or
whither
it
intended
to
set
therefore
there
was
no
way
of
patsy
telling
from
what
direction
she
had
come
or
where
arden
was
most
likely
to
be
found
she
shook
her
fist
at
the
sun
wrathfully
i
be
bound
you
in
league
with
the
tinker
is
all
a
conspiracy
to
keep
me
from
ever
making
arden
or
else
to
keep
me
just
seven
miles
from
it
that
a
grand
number
seven
a
glint
of
white
on
the
grass
caught
her
eye
she
stooped
and
found
it
to
be
a
diminutive
quill
feather
dropped
by
some
passing
pigeon
it
lay
across
her
palm
for
a
second
and
then
the
whim
taking
her
she
shot
it
exultantly
into
the
air
where
it
fell
she
marked
the
way
it
pointed
and
that
was
the
road
she
took
it
was
beginning
to
seem
years
ago
since
she
had
sat
in
marjorie
schuyler
den
listening
to
billy
burgeman
confession
of
a
crime
for
which
he
had
not
sounded
in
the
least
responsible
that
was
on
tuesday
it
was
now
friday
three
days
hours
later
she
preferred
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
hours
it
measured
the
time
proportionally
nearer
to
the
actual
feeling
of
it
strangely
enough
it
seemed
half
a
lifetime
instead
of
half
a
week
and
patsy
could
not
fathom
the
why
of
it
but
what
puzzled
her
more
was
the
present
condition
of
billy
burgeman
himself
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
he
had
suddenly
ceased
to
exist
and
she
was
pursuing
a
balmacaan
coat
and
plush
hat
that
were
quite
tenantless
or
at
most
they
were
supported
by
the
very
haziest
suggestion
of
a
personality
the
harder
she
struggled
to
make
a
man
therefrom
the
more
persistently
did
it
elude
her
slipping
through
her
mental
grasp
like
so
much
quicksilver
she
tried
her
best
to
picture
him
doing
something
feeling
something
the
simplest
human
emotion
and
the
result
was
an
absolute
blank
and
all
the
while
the
shadow
of
a
very
real
man
followed
her
down
the
road
a
shadow
in
grotesquely
flapping
rags
with
head
flung
back
a
dozen
times
she
caught
herself
listening
for
the
tramp
of
his
feet
beside
hers
and
flushed
hotly
at
the
nagging
consciousness
that
pointed
out
each
time
only
the
mocking
echo
of
her
own
tread
like
the
cottage
the
road
became
unexpectedly
lonely
and
discouraging
the
devil
take
them
both
she
sputtered
at
last
when
one
man
refuses
to
be
real
at
all
and
the
other
pesters
ye
with
being
too
real
is
time
to
quit
their
company
and
let
them
fetch
up
where
and
how
they
like
but
an
is
never
a
quitter
and
deep
down
in
patsy
heart
was
the
determination
to
see
the
end
of
the
road
for
all
three
of
them
if
fate
only
granted
the
chance
she
came
to
a
at
length
she
had
spied
it
from
afar
and
hailed
it
as
the
end
of
her
troubles
now
she
would
learn
the
right
way
to
arden
but
patsy
reckoned
without
chance
or
some
one
else
the
had
all
been
ripped
from
their
respective
places
on
a
central
post
and
lay
propped
up
against
its
base
there
was
little
information
in
them
for
patsy
as
she
read
petersham
five
miles
lebanon
twelve
miles
arden
seven
miles
the
last
sign
went
spinning
across
the
road
and
patsy
dropped
on
a
stone
with
the
anguish
of
a
great
tragedian
seven
miles
seven
miles
i
as
near
to
it
and
i
know
as
much
about
it
as
when
i
started
three
days
ago
sure
i
feel
like
a
mule
just
on
a
treadmill
with
billy
burgeman
in
the
hopper
a
feeling
of
utter
helplessness
took
possession
of
her
it
was
as
if
her
experiences
her
actions
her
very
words
and
emotions
were
controlled
by
an
unseen
power
impulse
might
have
precipitated
her
into
the
adventure
but
since
her
feet
had
trod
the
first
stretch
of
the
road
to
arden
chance
had
sat
somewhere
chuckling
at
his
own
comedy
making
while
he
pulled
her
hither
and
yon
like
a
marionette
on
a
wire
verily
chance
was
still
chuckling
at
the
incongruity
of
his
stage
setting
a
girl
pursuing
a
strange
man
and
a
strange
sheriff
pursuing
the
girl
and
neither
having
an
inkling
of
the
pursuit
or
the
reason
for
it
on
one
thing
her
mind
clinched
fast
however
she
would
at
least
sit
where
she
was
until
some
one
came
by
who
could
put
her
right
once
and
for
all
rich
man
poor
man
thief
she
would
stop
whoever
came
first
the
arpeggio
of
an
automobile
horn
brought
her
to
her
feet
the
next
moment
the
machine
careened
into
sight
and
patsy
flagged
it
from
the
middle
of
the
road
the
lines
of
her
face
set
in
grim
determination
would
you
kindly
tell
me
she
was
beginning
when
a
girl
in
the
tonneau
cut
her
short
why
it
patsy
how
in
the
name
of
your
blessed
saint
patrick
did
you
ever
get
so
far
from
home
the
car
was
full
of
young
people
but
the
girl
who
had
spoken
was
the
only
one
who
looked
at
all
familiar
patsy
mind
groped
out
of
the
present
into
the
past
it
was
all
a
blind
alley
however
and
led
nowhere
the
girl
seeing
her
bewilderment
helped
her
out
do
you
remember
i
was
with
marjorie
schuyler
in
dublin
when
you
were
all
so
jolly
kind
to
us
i
janet
payne
those
awful
paynes
and
the
girl
laugh
rang
out
contagiously
the
laugh
swept
patsy
mind
out
into
the
open
she
reached
out
and
gripped
the
girl
hand
sure
i
remember
but
it
a
long
way
from
dublin
and
my
memory
is
slower
at
hearkening
back
than
my
heart
a
brave
day
to
all
of
you
and
her
smile
greeted
the
carful
indiscriminately
oh
the
girl
was
apologetic
how
beastly
rude
i
am
forgetting
that
you
do
know
everybody
as
well
as
everybody
knows
you
jean
lewis
dempsy
carter
dempsy
carter
gregory
jessup

of
the
irish
national
players
we
are
all
very
much
at
your
service
including
the
car
which
is
not
mine
but
the
dempsy
carters
shall
we
kidnap
miss
suggested
the
owner
she
appears
an
easy
victim
janet
payne
clapped
her
hands
but
patsy
shook
a
decided
negative
that
the
genius
of
the
irish
she
laughed
they
look
easy
till
you
hold
them
up
i
bound
for
arden
and
must
make
it
by
the
quickest
road
if
you
point
it
out
to
me
why
of
course
arden
that
accounts
for
you
perfectly
stupid
that
i
did
think
of
it
at
once
what
part
are
you
playing
janet
payne
accompanied
the
question
with
unmistakable
eagerness
patsy
shot
a
shrewd
glance
at
the
girl
was
she
indulging
in
banter
or
had
she
learned
through
marjorie
schuyler
of
patsy
quest
and
was
seeking
information
in
figurative
speech
patsy
decided
in
favor
of
the
former
and
answered
it
in
kind
faith
i
not
sure
whether
i
been
cast
for
the
daughter
or
the
fool
i
can
tell
ye
better
after
i
reach
arden
and
she
turned
abruptly
as
if
she
would
be
gone
but
the
girl
held
her
back
no
you
do
we
are
not
going
to
lose
you
like
that
we
kidnap
you
as
dempsy
suggested
till
after
lunch
then
we
motor
you
back
to
arden
you
get
there
just
about
as
soon
patsy
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
yielding
her
mind
and
her
feet
were
braced
against
any
divergence
from
the
straight
road
now
but
the
man
janet
payne
had
called
gregory
jessup
said
something
that
scattered
her
resolutions
like
so
much
chaff
you
simply
got
to
come
miss
and
he
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
car
in
boyish
enthusiasm
last
summer
billy
burgeman
used
to
read
to
me
the
parts
of
marjorie
letters
that
told
about
you
and
they
were
great
we
were
making
up
our
minds
to
go
to
ireland
and
see
if
you
were
real
when
your
company
came
to
america
after
that
marjorie
would
never
introduce
us
after
the
plays
just
to
be
contrary
you
would
have
the
heart
to
grudge
us
a
little
acquaintanceship
now
would
you
billy
burgeman
repeated
patsy
do
you
know
him
dempsy
carter
interposed
they
chums
miss
i
wager
there
is
a
soul
on
earth
that
knows
billy
as
well
as
greg
does
that
hard
on
marjorie
is
it
asked
janet
payne
oh
hang
marjorie
the
sincerity
of
gregory
jessup
emotion
somewhat
excused
his
outburst
why
i
thought
they
were
betrothed
patsy
looked
innocent
they
were
what
they
are
now
heaven
only
knows
marjorie
schuyler
has
gone
to
china
and
billy
has
dropped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
a
sudden
silence
fell
on
the
it
was
patsy
who
broke
it
at
last
well
a
composite
interrogative
stare
came
from
the
carful
patsy
laughed
bewitchingly
for
a
crowd
of
rascally
kidnappers
you
are
the
slowest
i
ever
saw
troth
in
ireland
have
it
done
in
half
the
time
the
next
instant
patsy
was
lifted
bodily
inside
and
amid
a
general
burst
of
merriment
the
car
swung
down
the
road
it
was
a
picnic
lunch
an
elaborate
affair
put
up
in
a
hamper
a
fireless
cooker
and
a
thermos
basket
and
it
was
spread
on
a
tiny
peninsula
jutting
out
into
a
diminutive
lake
it
was
an
enchanting
spot
and
a
delicious
lunch
with
good
company
to
boot
but
to
her
annoyance
patsy
found
herself
continually
comparing
it
unfavorably
with
a
certain
vagabond
breakfast
garnished
with
yellow
musicianed
by
throstles
and
served
by
a
tinker
something
is
on
your
mind
or
do
you
find
our
american
manners
and
food
too
hard
to
digest
comfortably
gregory
jessup
had
curled
up
unceremoniously
at
her
feet
balancing
a
caviar
sandwich
a
camembert
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
ale
with
extraordinary
dexterity
i
was
thinking
about
billy
burgeman
he
cast
a
furtive
look
toward
the
others
beyond
them
they
seemed
engrossed
for
the
moment
in
some
hectic
discussion
over
fashions
and
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
confidential
pitch
i
ca
talk
billy
with
the
others
i
too
much
cut
up
over
the
whole
thing
to
stand
hearing
them
hold
an
autopsy
over
billy
character
and
motives
he
stopped
abruptly
and
scanned
patsy
face
i
believe
a
chap
could
turn
his
mind
inside
out
with
you
though
and
you
keep
the
contents
as
faithfully
as
a
vault
patsy
smiled
appreciatively
faith
you
make
me
feel
like
saint
martin
chest
that
satan
himself
could
be
opening
what
did
he
have
in
it
some
good
christian
souls
contents
do
tally
mine
are
some
very
thoughts
he
abandoned
the
sandwich
and
cheese
and
settled
himself
to
the
more
serious
business
of
balancing
his
remarks
billy
and
i
work
for
the
same
engineering
firm
he
walked
out
for
lunch
tuesday
and
no
one
has
seen
him
since
unless
it
marjorie
schuyler
could
get
anything
out
of
the
old
man
when
i
first
went
to
see
him
and
now
he
too
ill
to
see
any
one
marjorie
said
she
really
did
know
where
he
was
and
quit
town
the
next
day
now
maybe
they
do
either
of
them
know
what
happened
any
more
than
i
do
but
i
think
it
infernally
queer
for
a
man
to
disappear
and
say
nothing
to
his
father
the
girl
engaged
to
or
his
best
friend
do
you
patsy
past
training
stood
stanchly
by
her
she
played
the
part
of
the
politely
interested
listener
nothing
more
and
merely
nodded
her
head
you
see
the
man
went
on
billy
has
a
confoundedly
queer
sense
of
honor
he
can
stretch
it
at
times
to
cover
nearly
calamities
and
the
fool
shortcomings
of
all
his
acquaintances
why
it
was
a
month
ago
a
crowd
of
us
from
the
works
were
lunching
together
and
the
talk
came
around
to
speculating
billy
hard
against
it
on
principle
but
he
happened
to
say
that
if
he
was
going
in
for
it
at
all
he
take
cotton
what
was
in
billy
mind
was
not
the
money
in
it
but
the
chance
to
give
the
south
a
boost
well
one
of
the
fellows
took
it
as
a
straight
tip
to
get
rich
from
the
old
man
son
and
put
in
all
he
had
saved
up
to
be
married
on
lost
it
and
squealed
and
billy
the
big
chump
claimed
he
was
responsible
for
it
that
being
the
son
of
his
father
he
ought
to
know
enough
to
hold
his
tongue
on
some
subjects
he
made
it
good
to
the
fellow
i
happen
to
know
for
it
took
every
cent
of
his
own
money
and
his
next
month
salary
into
the
bargain
and
that
he
borrowed
from
me
would
his
father
have
helped
him
out
gregory
jessup
gave
a
bitter
little
laugh
you
do
know
the
old
man
or
you
would
ask
he
is
just
about
as
and
human
as
a
labrador
winter
i
known
billy
since
we
were
both
little
shavers
and
talk
about
the
curse
of
poverty
it
a
saintly
benediction
compared
to
a
fortune
like
that
and
life
with
the
man
who
made
it
and
himself
billy
what
does
he
think
of
money
i
tell
you
what
he
said
once
he
had
dropped
in
late
after
a
big
dinner
where
he
had
been
introduced
to
some
one
as
the
fellow
who
was
going
to
inherit
sixty
millions
some
day
phew
but
he
was
sore
he
walked
miles
in
laps
about
my
den
while
he
cursed
his
father
money
from
baffin
bay
to
cape
horn
tell
you
greg
he
finished
up
with
want
enough
to
keep
the
cramps
out
of
life
that
all
enough
to
help
the
next
fellow
who
down
on
his
luck
enough
to
give
the
woman
i
marry
a
home
and
not
a
residence
to
live
in
and
to
provide
the
father
of
my
kiddies
with
enough
leisure
for
them
to
know
what
real
fatherhood
means
i
bet
you
i
can
make
enough
myself
to
cover
every
one
of
those
necessities
as
for
the
millions
i
like
to
chuck
them
for
quoits
off
the
battery
for
a
moment
patsy
eyes
danced
but
the
next
something
tumbled
out
of
her
memory
and
quieted
them
then
why
in
the
name
of
saint
anthony
did
he
choose
to
marry
marjorie
schuyler
that
does
seem
funny
i
know
but
that
a
totally
different
side
of
billy
you
see
all
his
life
he
been
falling
in
with
people
who
made
up
to
him
just
for
his
money
and
his
father
had
a
confounded
way
of
reminding
him
that
he
was
bound
to
be
plucked
unless
he
kept
his
wits
sharp
and
distrusted
every
one
it
made
billy
sick
and
yet
it
had
its
effect
he
always
been
mighty
shy
with
girls
reckon
his
father
brought
him
up
on
tales
of
rich
chaps
and
modern
circes
anyway
when
he
met
marjorie
schuyler
it
was
different
she
had
too
much
money
of
her
own
to
make
his
any
particular
attraction
and
he
finally
gave
in
that
she
liked
him
just
for
himself
that
was
a
proud
day
for
him
poor
old
bill
and
did
she
could
she
really
love
him
patsy
asked
the
question
of
herself
rather
than
the
man
beside
her
but
he
answered
it
promptly
i
do
believe
marjorie
schuyler
has
anything
to
love
with
it
was
overlooked
when
she
was
made
what
worrying
me
if
he
got
into
a
scrape
he
tell
marjorie
the
first
thing
and
she
not
the
understanding
forgiving
kind
he
has
any
money
he
would
go
to
his
father
and
because
borrowed
from
me
once
he
that
idiotic
he
would
do
it
again
if
marjorie
has
given
him
his
papers
he
in
a
jolly
blue
funk
and
perfectly
capable
of
going
off
where
he
never
be
heard
of
again
hang
it
all
i
do
see
why
he
could
have
come
to
me
patsy
said
nothing
while
he
replenished
her
plate
and
helped
himself
to
another
sandwich
at
last
she
asked
casually
did
the
two
of
you
ever
have
a
disagreement
over
marjorie
schuyler
he
asked
me
once
just
what
i
thought
of
her
and
i
told
him
we
never
discussed
her
again
no
inwardly
patsy
was
tabulating
why
billy
burgeman
had
not
gone
to
his
friend
when
marjorie
schuyler
failed
him
he
would
hardly
have
cared
to
criticize
the
shortcomings
of
the
girl
he
loved
with
the
man
who
had
already
discovered
them
what
are
you
two
jabbering
about
janet
payne
had
left
her
group
and
the
hectic
argument
over
fashions
sure
we
threshing
out
whether
it
the
irish
or
the
suffragettes
will
rule
england
when
the
war
is
over
well
which
is
it
faith
the
answer
so
simple
i
ashamed
to
give
it
the
women
will
rule
england
that
an
easy
matter
but
the
irish
will
rule
the
women
then
you
are
one
of
the
kind
who
approves
of
a
lord
and
master
gregory
jessup
looked
up
at
her
quizzically
is
the
new
fashion
you
meaning
having
gone
out
so
long
since
barely
coming
in
yet
i
not
give
a
farthing
for
the
man
who
could
lead
me
only
god
help
him
if
he
ever
leaves
his
hands
off
the
halter
the
laugh
that
followed
gave
patsy
time
to
think
there
was
one
more
question
she
must
be
asking
before
the
others
joined
them
and
the
conversation
became
general
she
turned
to
janet
payne
with
a
little
air
of
anxious
inquiry
maybe
you
ask
the
rascally
villain
who
kidnapped
me
when
he
has
it
in
his
mind
to
keep
his
promise
and
fetch
me
to
arden
as
the
girl
left
them
patsy
turned
toward
gregory
jessup
again
and
asked
softly
supposing
billy
burgeman
has
fallen
among
strangers
if
they
saw
he
was
in
need
of
friendliness
would
it
be
so
hard
to
do
him
a
kindness
the
man
shook
his
head
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
billy
burgeman
has
been
proud
and
lonely
all
his
life
and
it
an
infernal
combination
you
may
know
he
out
and
out
aching
for
a
bit
of
sympathy
but
you
never
offer
it
you
do
dare
we
could
never
get
him
to
own
up
as
a
little
shaver
how
neglected
and
lonely
he
was
and
how
he
hated
to
stay
in
that
horrible
gloomy
fifth
avenue
house
it
was
until
he
had
grown
up
that
he
told
me
he
used
to
come
and
play
as
often
as
they
would
let
him
just
because
mother
used
to
kiss
him
as
she
did
her
own
boys
gregory
jessup
looked
beyond
the
firs
to
the
little
lake
and
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
showed
that
he
was
wrestling
with
a
treasured
memory
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
sounded
as
if
he
had
had
to
grip
it
hard
against
a
sign
of
possible
emotion
you
know
billy
father
never
gave
him
an
allowance
he
believe
in
it
would
trust
billy
with
a
cent
poor
little
shaver
never
had
anything
to
treat
with
at
school
the
way
the
rest
of
the
boys
did
and
never
even
had
always
walked
rain
or
shine
unless
his
father
took
him
along
with
him
in
the
machine
billy
used
to
say
even
in
those
days
he
liked
walking
better
mother
died
in
the
winter
snowy
time
when
billy
was
about
twelve
and
he
borrowed
a
shovel
from
a
corner
grocer
and
cleared
stoops
all
afternoon
until
he
made
enough
to
buy
two
white
roses
father
had
broken
down
all
day
would
let
us
children
show
a
tear
but
when
billy
came
in
with
those
roses
well
it
was
the
children
who
finally
had
to
cheer
father
up
patsy
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
little
cry
i
must
be
going
she
turned
to
the
others
a
ring
of
appeal
in
her
voice
ca
we
hurry
a
bit
there
a
deal
of
work
at
arden
to
be
done
and
no
one
but
myself
to
be
doing
it
rehearsals
asked
janet
payne
and
patsy
unheeding
nodded
her
head
there
was
a
babel
of
nonsense
in
the
returning
car
patsy
contributed
her
share
the
while
her
mind
was
busy
building
over
again
into
a
balmacaan
coat
and
plush
hat
the
semblance
of
a
man
sure
i
not
saying
i
can
make
out
his
looks
or
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
hair
but
he
real
for
all
that
holy
saint
patrick
but
he
a
real
man
at
last
and
i
liking
him
she
smiled
with
deep
contentment
x
joseph
journeys
to
a
far
country
having
established
the
permanent
reality
of
billy
burgeman
to
her
own
satisfaction
patsy
mind
went
racing
off
to
conjure
up
all
the
possible
things
billy
and
the
tinker
might
think
of
each
other
as
soon
as
chance
should
bring
them
together
whereas
it
was
perfectly
consistent
that
billy
should
shun
the
consolation
and
companionship
of
his
own
world
he
might
follow
after
vagabond
company
as
a
thirsty
dog
trails
water
and
who
could
slake
that
thirst
better
than
the
tinker
for
a
second
time
that
day
she
pictured
the
two
swinging
down
the
open
road
together
and
for
the
second
time
she
pulled
a
wry
little
smile
the
car
was
nearing
the
from
which
patsy
had
been
originally
kidnapped
she
looked
up
to
identify
it
and
saw
a
second
car
speeding
toward
them
from
the
opposite
direction
while
between
the
two
plodded
a
solitary
little
figure
coming
toward
them
supported
by
a
mammoth
pilgrim
staff
it
was
a
boy
apparently
conscious
of
but
the
one
car
theirs
and
he
swerved
to
their
left
straight
into
the
path
of
the
car
behind
to
let
them
pass
they
sounded
their
horns
waved
their
hands
and
shouted
warnings
it
seemed
wholly
unbelievable
that
he
should
not
understand
or
that
the
other
car
would
not
stop
but
the
unbelievable
happened
it
does
sometimes
before
gregory
jessup
could
jump
from
their
machine
the
other
car
had
struck
and
the
boy
was
tossed
like
a
bundle
of
empty
clothing
to
the
roadside
beyond
the
nightmarish
suddenness
of
it
all
held
them
speechless
while
they
gaped
at
the
car
driver
who
gave
one
backward
glance
and
redoubled
his
speed
patsy
was
the
first
out
of
the
tonneau
and
she
reached
the
boy
almost
as
soon
as
gregory
jessup
damn
them
that
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
seen
a
machine
run
some
one
down
and
sneak
he
broke
off
at
patsy
sharp
cry
holy
mary
keep
him
is
the
wee
lad
from
lebanon
by
this
time
the
rest
of
the
carful
had
gathered
about
them
and
dempsy
carter
being
a
good
catholic
bared
his
head
and
crossed
himself
is
wee
joseph
of
lebanon
patsy
repeated
dully
and
then
to
dempsy
carter
aye
make
a
prayer
for
him
but
ye
best
do
it
driving
like
the
devil
for
the
doctor
they
left
at
once
with
her
instructions
to
get
the
nearest
doctor
first
and
then
to
go
after
the
boy
parents
gregory
jessup
stayed
behind
with
her
and
together
they
tried
to
lift
the
still
little
figure
onto
some
rugs
and
pillows
then
patsy
crept
closer
and
wound
her
arms
about
him
chafing
his
cheeks
and
hands
and
watching
for
some
sign
of
returning
life
the
man
stood
silently
beside
them
holding
the
pilgrim
staff
while
his
eyes
wandered
from
patsy
to
the
child
and
back
to
patsy
again
her
face
full
of
harboring
tenderness
and
a
great
suffering
as
she
gathered
the
little
boy
into
her
arms
and
pressed
her
warm
cheek
against
the
cold
one
only
once
during
their
long
wait
was
the
silence
broken
is
almost
as
if
he
slipped
over
the
border
patsy
whispered
maybe
there
in
the
gray
dusk
a
wee
shadow
soul
waiting
for
death
to
loosen
its
wings
and
send
it
lilting
into
the
blue
of
the
far
country
how
did
you
happen
to
know
him
chance
just
i
stopped
to
tell
him
a
tale
of
a
wandering
hero
and
he
she
broke
off
with
a
little
moan
poor
wee
joseph
did
i
send
ye
forth
on
a
brave
adventure
only
to
bring
ye
to
this
her
fingers
brushed
the
damp
curls
from
his
forehead
laddy
laddy
why
did
ye
mind
the
promise
i
laid
on
ye
the
doctor
was
kindly
and
efficient
but
professionally
the
boy
was
badly
injured
and
he
must
be
moved
at
once
to
the
nearest
house
somehow
they
lifted
joseph
and
held
him
so
as
to
break
the
jar
of
stone
and
rut
as
the
doctor
drove
his
car
as
carefully
as
he
could
down
the
road
leading
to
the
nearest
there
they
were
met
with
a
generous
warmth
of
sympathy
and
hospitality
the
spare
chamber
was
opened
and
the
farm
wife
bustled
about
turning
down
the
bed
and
bringing
what
comforts
the
house
possessed
the
doctor
stayed
as
long
as
he
could
but
the
stork
was
flying
at
the
other
end
of
the
township
and
he
was
forced
to
leave
patsy
in
charge
with
abundant
instructions
soon
after
his
leaving
the
dempsy
carters
returned
without
parents
they
had
gone
to
town
and
were
not
expected
home
until
chore
time
all
right
patsy
sighed
now
ye
had
best
all
go
your
ways
and
bide
till
morning
but
can
you
janet
payne
asked
it
wonderingly
i
thought
you
said
you
had
to
be
in
arden
a
smile
whimsical
and
baffling
crept
to
the
corners
of
mouth
sure
life
is
crammed
with
things
ye
think
have
to
be
done
till
they
matched
against
a
sudden
greater
need
chance
and
i
started
the
wee
lad
on
his
journey
and
was
meant
i
should
see
him
safe
to
the
end
i
thinking
gregory
jessup
lingered
a
moment
behind
the
others
his
eyes
were
suspiciously
red
and
the
hands
that
gripped
patsy
shook
the
least
bit
i
wanted
to
say
something
if
if
you
should
ever
happen
to
run
up
against
billy
burgeman
anywhere
do
be
afraid
to
do
him
a
kindness
he
he
would
mind
it
from
you
patsy
leaned
against
the
door
and
watched
him
go
there
another
good
lad
i
like
to
be
finding
him
again
too
some
day
she
pressed
her
hands
over
her
eyes
with
a
fierce
little
groan
as
if
she
would
blot
out
the
enveloping
tragedy
along
with
her
surroundings
faith
what
is
the
meaning
of
life
anyway
until
it
has
seemed
such
a
simple
straight
road
i
could
have
drawn
a
fair
map
of
it
myself
marking
well
the
and
tracing
it
reasonably
true
to
the
finish
but
is
all
a
tangle
of
lanes
and
byways
there
no
ahead
and
god
alone
knows
where
it
leading
she
went
back
to
the
spare
chamber
and
took
up
her
watching
by
the
bedside
and
for
the
rest
of
that
waning
day
she
sat
as
motionless
as
everything
else
in
the
room
the
farm
wife
came
and
went
softly
in
between
her
preparations
for
supper
when
it
was
ready
she
tried
her
best
to
urge
patsy
for
a
mouthful
but
the
girl
refused
to
stir
i
could
the
wee
lad
might
come
back
while
i
was
gone
and
find
no
one
to
reach
him
a
hand
or
smile
him
a
welcome
a
little
later
as
the
dark
gathered
she
begged
two
candles
and
stood
them
on
the
stand
beside
the
bed
something
in
her
movements
or
the
flickering
light
must
have
pierced
his
stupor
for
joseph
moaned
slightly
and
in
a
moment
opened
his
eyes
patsy
leaned
over
him
tenderly
could
she
only
keep
him
content
until
the
mother
came
and
guard
the
mysterious
borderland
against
all
fear
or
pain
laddy
laddy
she
coaxed
do
ye
mind
me
now
the
veriest
wisp
of
a
smile
answered
her
and
were
ye
for
playing
jack
yourself
tramping
off
to
find
the
castle
with
a
window
in
it
for
every
day
in
the
year
her
voice
was
full
of
gentle
teasing
laughter
the
voice
of
a
mother
playing
with
a
very
little
child
i
hoping
ye
did
forget
the
promise
ye
did
forget
to
ask
for
the
blessing
before
ye
went
now
no
sound
came
but
the
boy
lips
framed
a
silent
no
in
another
moment
his
eyes
were
drooping
sleepily
night
had
come
and
with
it
the
insistent
chorus
of
and
katydid
interspersed
with
the
song
of
the
vesper
sparrow
from
the
kitchen
came
the
occasional
rattle
of
dish
or
pan
and
the
murmur
of
voices
patsy
strained
her
ears
for
some
sound
of
car
or
team
upon
the
road
but
there
was
none
again
the
lids
fluttered
and
opened
this
time
joseph
smiled
triumphantly
i
thought
i
had
found
you
after
all
there
was
so
many
ways
you
might
ha
went
he
moistened
his
lips
at
the
i
was
quite
sure
which
to
be
takin
but
i
took
the
right
one
i
did
did
i
there
was
a
ring
of
pride
in
the
words
and
patsy
moistened
her
lips
something
clutched
at
her
throat
that
seemed
to
force
the
words
back
aye
she
managed
to
say
at
last
an
i
found
you
now
you
have
to
promise
me
not
to
go
back
not
where
they
can
get
you
si
perkins
said
as
how
they
soon
forget
if
you
just
stayed
away
long
enough
the
boy
looked
at
her
happily
let
let
keep
on
an
see
what
lies
over
the
next
hill
to
patsy
this
was
all
an
unintelligible
wandering
of
mind
she
must
humor
it
all
right
laddy
let
keep
on
maybe
we
be
finding
a
wood
full
of
wild
creatures
or
an
ocean
full
of
ships
but
i
rather
have
it
a
big
big
city
i
never
saw
a
city
aye
is
a
city
then
patsy
tone
carried
conviction
the
grandest
city
ever
built
and
the
towers
will
be
touching
the
clouds
and
the
streets
will
be
white
as
and
there
will
be
a
great
stretch
of
green
meadow
for
fairs
an
circuses
what
else
but
circuses
and
at
the
entrance
there
will
be
a
gate
with
tall
white
columns
the
sound
patsy
had
been
listening
for
came
at
last
through
the
open
windows
the
of
horses
hoofs
coming
fast
joseph
looked
past
patsy
and
saw
for
the
first
time
the
candles
by
his
bed
his
eyes
sparkled
they
woppin
big
columns
an
at
night
they
have
lighted
lamps
on
top
all
shinin
do
they
aye
to
point
the
way
in
the
dark
it
dark
now
the
boy
voice
lagged
in
a
tired
fashion
maybe
we
best
hurry
then
a
door
slammed
below
and
there
was
a
rustle
of
tongues
who
be
the
city
gates
asked
joseph
who
but
the
gatekeeper
muffled
feet
crept
up
the
stairs
will
he
let
us
in
he
let
ye
in
laddy
i
might
be
too
much
of
a
stranger
but
i
could
speak
for
you
i
i
would
like
goin
in
alone
in
the
dark
bless
ye
ye
not
be
alone
patsy
voice
rang
vibrant
with
gladness
now
who
do
you
think
will
be
watching
for
ye
close
to
the
gate
look
yonder
joseph
eyes
went
back
to
the
candles
splendid
tall
columns
they
were
with
beacon
lamps
capping
each
who
dim
faces
looked
at
him
through
the
flickering
light
but
there
was
only
one
he
saw
and
it
brought
the
merriest
smile
to
his
lips
why
it
mother
sure
shootin
early
the
next
morning
patsy
waited
on
the
braided
rug
outside
the
spare
chamber
for
joseph
mother
to
come
out
i
been
praying
ye
not
hate
me
for
the
tale
i
told
the
little
lad
that
day
the
tale
that
brought
him
yonder
and
if
it
overlate
i
like
to
be
thanking
ye
for
taking
me
in
that
night
the
woman
looked
at
her
searchingly
through
swollen
lids
i
there
no
thanks
due
your
man
paid
for
your
keep
he
sawed
and
split
nigh
a
cord
o
wood
that
night
must
ha
taken
him
till
mornin
she
paused
an
instant
did
he
she
nodded
her
head
toward
the
closed
door
behind
her
never
tell
you
what
brought
him
naught
but
that
he
wanted
to
find
me
he
believed
in
you
the
woman
said
simply
adding
in
a
toneless
voice
i
i
could
hate
you
i
never
saw
any
one
make
death
so
sweet
like
as
you
done
for
him
patsy
spread
her
hands
deprecatingly
why
should
it
be
sweet
like
faith
is
it
anything
but
a
bit
of
the
very
road
we
been
traveling
since
we
were
born
the
bit
that
lies
over
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
she
took
the
woman
hands
in
hers
is
terrible
losing
a
little
lad
but
is
more
terrible
never
having
one
god
and
mary
be
with
ye
when
patsy
left
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
joseph
pilgrim
staff
was
in
her
hands
and
she
stopped
on
the
threshold
an
instant
to
ask
the
way
of
joseph
father
the
good
man
was
dazed
with
his
grief
and
he
directed
patsy
in
terms
of
his
own
keep
on
and
take
the
first
turn
to
your
right
so
patsy
kept
on
instead
of
returning
to
the
and
chance
scored
another
point
in
his
comedy
and
continued
chuckling
meanwhile
joseph
father
went
back
to
the
spare
chamber
she
gone
inquired
joseph
mother
yep
you
know
the
boy
believed
in
her
yep
i
know
well
i
we
got
to
too
sure
thing
ye
never
say
a
word
then
about
seein
her
nuthin
to
give
the
sheriff
a
hint
where
she
might
be
why
mother
the
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
looking
down
at
her
with
accusing
eyes
hai
you
known
me
long
enough
to
know
i
could
tell
on
any
one
who
been
good
to
he
broke
off
with
a
cough
and
what
more
do
you
think
any
one
who
could
take
our
little
boy
hand
and
lead
him
as
you
might
say
straight
to
heaven
would
be
a
thief
no
siree
it
was
a
sober
thoughtful
patsy
that
followed
the
road
the
pilgrim
staff
gripped
tightly
in
her
hand
she
clung
to
it
as
the
one
tangible
thing
left
to
her
out
of
all
the
happenings
and
memories
of
her
quest
the
tinker
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
leaving
behind
no
reason
for
his
going
no
hope
of
his
coming
again
billy
burgeman
was
still
but
a
flimsy
promise
and
joseph
had
outstripped
them
both
passing
beyond
her
farthest
vision
small
wonder
then
that
the
road
was
lonely
and
haunted
for
patsy
and
that
she
plodded
along
shorn
of
all
buoyancy
her
imagination
began
playing
tricks
with
her
twice
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
feel
a
little
lad
hand
warm
and
eager
curled
under
hers
about
the
staff
another
time
she
found
herself
gazing
through
eyes
at
a
strange
lad
a
lad
of
twelve
who
walked
ahead
for
a
space
carrying
two
great
white
roses
and
once
she
glanced
up
quickly
and
saw
the
tinker
coming
toward
her
head
thrown
back
and
laughing
her
wits
had
barely
time
to
check
her
answering
laugh
and
hands
outstretching
when
he
faded
into
empty
winding
road
the
morning
was
uneventful
patsy
stopped
but
once
to
trundle
a
perambulator
laden
with
washing
and
twins
for
its
small
conductor
a
mite
of
a
girl
who
looked
almost
too
frail
to
breast
the
weight
of
a
doll
carriage
even
patsy
puffed
under
the
strain
of
the
burden
how
do
you
do
it
she
gasped
well
i
started
when
them
babies
was
tiny
and
the
washin
was
small
an
they
both
growed
so
gradual
i
did
notice
much
an
ma
make
me
hurry
none
how
many
children
are
there
nine
last
just
come
pa
says
he
did
look
on
him
as
no
blessin
but
ma
says
the
lord
must
provide
an
if
it
babies
then
it
babies
she
stopped
and
clasped
her
hands
after
the
fashion
of
an
ancient
grandmother
tottering
in
the
nineties
land
o
goodness
i
do
think
an
empty
cradle
an
awful
dismal
thing
to
have
round
do
you
patsy
agreed
and
a
moment
later
unloaded
the
twins
and
the
washing
for
the
child
at
her
doorstep
soon
after
this
she
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
the
town
she
was
making
if
luck
will
only
turn
she
thought
and
put
billy
burgeman
in
the
center
of
the
scene
handy
why
i
promise
not
to
murder
my
lines
or
play
under
it
was
not
luck
however
but
chance
still
pulling
the
wires
and
accordingly
he
managed
patsy
entrance
as
he
wished
the
town
had
one
main
street
like
lebanon
and
in
front
of
the
in
a
car
sat
a
familiar
figure
there
was
the
balmacaan
coat
and
the
round
plush
hat
and
to
patsy
impulsive
and
it
sufficed
she
ran
nearly
the
length
of
the
street
in
her
eagerness
to
reach
him
xi
and
chance
stages
melodrama
instead
of
comedy
a
brave
day
to
ye
a
little
bit
of
everything
that
made
patsy
was
wrapped
in
the
smile
she
gave
the
man
in
the
balmacaan
coat
standing
by
the
of
the
car
before
the
town
a
hand
on
the
front
seat
maybe
ye
not
knowing
it
but
it
a
rare
good
day
for
us
both
if
you
only
take
me
for
a
spin
in
your
car
i
tell
you
what
brings
me
and
who
i
am
if
you
have
that
guessed
already
plainly
the
occupant
of
the
coat
and
the
car
was
too
much
taken
by
surprise
to
guess
he
simply
stared
and
by
that
stare
conveyed
a
impression
to
patsy
she
looked
at
the
puffed
eyes
and
the
grim
unyielding
line
of
the
mouth
and
she
wanted
to
run
it
took
all
the
stubbornness
coupled
with
the
things
gregory
jessup
had
told
her
about
his
friend
to
keep
her
feet
firm
to
the
sidewalk
and
her
resolution
maybe
she
thought
he
just
taken
on
the
look
of
a
rascal
because
he
thinks
the
world
has
written
him
down
one
that
often
the
way
with
a
man
and
often
it
takes
but
a
bit
of
kindness
to
change
it
if
i
could
make
him
smile
now
her
next
remark
accomplished
this
but
it
did
not
mend
matters
a
whit
patsy
heart
turned
over
disconsolately
and
she
was
her
wits
to
keep
them
from
scattering
when
she
made
her
final
plea
i
not
staying
long
and
i
want
to
know
you
there
something
i
have
to
be
saying
before
i
go
on
my
way
be
easiest
if
take
me
for
a
ride
in
your
car
we
could
talk
quieter
there
she
tried
to
finish
with
a
reasonably
cheerful
look
but
it
was
a
tragic
failure
the
man
was
looking
past
her
to
the
beyond
and
the
things
patsy
had
seemed
to
feel
in
his
face
suddenly
rose
to
the
surface
and
revealed
themselves
with
an
intensity
patsy
followed
the
look
over
her
shoulder
and
shrank
away
perceptibly
in
the
doorway
of
the
office
stood
another
man
younger
and
more
pronounced
it
could
mean
but
one
thing
billy
burgeman
had
lost
his
along
with
marjorie
schuyler
and
had
fallen
in
with
foul
company
there
were
natures
that
crumbled
and
went
to
pieces
under
distrust
and
failure
natures
that
allowed
themselves
to
be
blown
by
passion
and
until
they
burned
down
into
charred
heaps
of
humanity
she
had
met
a
few
of
them
in
her
life
but
thank
god
there
were
only
a
few
she
found
herself
praying
that
she
might
not
have
come
too
late
just
what
she
would
do
or
say
she
could
not
tell
but
she
must
make
him
understand
that
he
was
not
the
arbiter
of
his
own
life
that
in
spite
of
what
he
had
found
there
were
love
and
trust
and
disinterested
kindness
in
the
world
lots
of
it
money
might
be
a
curse
but
it
was
a
curse
that
a
man
could
raise
for
himself
and
a
little
lad
who
could
shovel
snow
for
half
a
day
to
earn
two
white
roses
for
a
dead
friend
was
too
fine
to
be
lost
out
of
life
she
did
not
wait
for
any
invitation
silently
with
a
white
face
she
climbed
into
the
car
and
sat
with
hands
folded
about
the
pilgrim
staff
it
was
as
if
she
had
taken
him
for
granted
and
was
waiting
for
his
compliance
to
her
will
and
he
understood
he
moved
the
starter
and
as
the
motor
began
its
chugging
he
called
out
to
the
man
in
the
doorway
better
not
wait
for
me
i
seem
to
have
a
date
with
a
lady
there
was
an
unpleasant
intonation
on
the
last
word
please
take
a
quiet
road
where
there
will
not
be
much
passing
commanded
patsy
she
did
not
speak
again
until
the
town
lay
far
behind
and
they
were
well
on
that
quiet
road
then
she
turned
partly
toward
him
her
hands
still
clasped
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
still
in
the
best
of
the
king
english
she
had
neither
feeling
nor
desire
for
the
intimacy
of
her
own
tongue
i
know
it
must
seem
a
bit
odd
to
have
me
a
stranger
come
to
you
this
way
but
when
a
man
family
and
betrothed
fail
him
why
some
one
must
make
it
up
he
turned
fiercely
how
did
you
know
that
i
she
never
mind
i
know
that
all
and
i
came
thinking
maybe
you
be
glad
of
another
he
laughed
coarsely
looking
her
over
with
an
appraising
scrutiny
well
a
fellow
might
have
a
worse
substitute
patsy
crimsoned
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
man
she
had
listened
to
that
day
in
marjorie
schuyler
den
who
had
then
gripped
her
sympathies
and
thereby
pulled
her
after
him
in
spite
of
past
illness
and
all
common
sense
should
be
the
man
speaking
now
and
yet
what
was
it
gregory
jessup
had
said
about
him
had
he
not
implied
that
old
king
midas
had
long
ago
warped
his
son
trust
in
women
until
he
had
come
to
look
upon
them
all
as
modern
circes
and
gradually
shame
for
herself
changed
into
pity
for
him
what
a
shabby
performance
life
must
seem
to
such
as
he
she
had
an
irresistible
desire
to
take
him
with
her
behind
the
scenes
and
show
him
what
it
really
was
to
point
out
how
with
a
change
of
line
here
a
new
cue
there
and
a
different
drop
behind
with
a
choice
of
and
better
lights
and
the
right
spirit
back
of
it
all
what
a
good
thing
he
could
make
of
his
particular
part
but
would
he
see
could
she
make
him
understand
it
was
worth
trying
you
are
every
bit
wrong
she
said
evenly
look
at
me
do
i
look
like
an
adventuress
and
have
you
ever
had
anybody
kind
to
you
simply
because
they
had
a
preference
for
kindness
the
two
looked
at
each
other
steadily
while
the
machine
crawled
at
minimum
speed
down
the
deserted
road
her
eyes
never
flinched
under
the
blighting
weight
of
his
although
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
a
hundred
times
and
the
soul
of
her
shrivel
into
nothing
well
she
heard
herself
saying
at
last
do
you
think
you
can
believe
in
me
the
man
laughed
again
coarsely
believe
in
you
that
precisely
what
i
doing
this
minute
believing
in
your
cleverness
and
a
deuced
pretty
way
with
you
now
do
get
mad
my
dear
you
are
all
daughters
of
eve
and
your
intentions
are
very
innocent
of
course
pity
and
sympathy
left
patsy
like
starved
pensioners
the
eyes
looking
into
his
blazed
with
righteous
anger
and
a
hating
distrust
they
carried
to
him
a
stronger
more
direct
message
than
words
could
have
done
his
answer
was
to
double
the
speed
of
the
car
stop
the
car
she
demanded
oh
ho
we
getting
scared
are
we
repenting
of
our
haste
the
grim
line
of
his
mouth
became
more
sinister
no
man
relishes
a
woman
contempt
and
he
generally
makes
her
pay
when
he
can
now
i
came
for
pleasure
and
i
going
to
get
it
an
arm
shot
around
patsy
and
held
her
tight
the
man
was
strong
enough
to
keep
her
where
he
wished
her
and
steer
the
car
down
a
straight
empty
road
remember
i
can
prove
you
asked
me
to
take
you
and
it
was
your
choice
this
nice
quiet
spin
she
sat
so
still
so
relaxed
under
his
grip
that
unconsciously
he
relaxed
too
she
could
feel
the
gradual
loosening
of
joint
and
muscle
why
did
you
scream
he
sneered
at
length
i
keeping
my
breath
till
there
need
of
it
silence
followed
the
car
raced
on
down
the
persistently
empty
road
the
few
houses
they
passed
might
have
been
tenantless
for
any
signs
of
human
life
about
them
in
the
far
distance
patsy
could
see
a
and
she
wished
and
wished
it
might
be
closed
for
repairs
something
anything
to
bring
to
an
end
this
hideous
nightmarish
ride
she
groaned
inwardly
at
the
thought
of
it
all
she
patricia
who
would
have
starved
rather
than
play
cheap
sordid
melodrama
had
been
tricked
by
chance
into
becoming
an
actual
living
part
of
one
she
wondered
a
little
why
she
felt
no
fear
she
certainly
had
nothing
but
distrust
and
loathing
for
the
man
beside
her
and
these
are
breeders
of
fear
perhaps
her
anger
had
crowded
out
all
other
possible
emotion
perhaps
back
of
everything
she
still
hoped
for
the
ultimate
spark
of
decency
and
good
in
him
her
silence
and
apparent
apathy
puzzled
the
man
well
what
in
your
mind
he
snapped
two
things
i
was
thinking
what
a
pity
it
was
you
let
your
father
throw
so
much
filth
in
your
eyes
that
you
grew
up
to
see
everything
about
you
smirched
and
ugly
and
i
was
wondering
how
you
ever
came
to
have
a
friend
like
gregory
jessup
and
a
fancy
for
white
roses
what
in
thunder
are
you
talking
but
he
never
finished
the
scream
he
had
looked
for
came
when
he
had
given
up
expecting
it
patsy
had
wrenched
herself
free
from
his
hold
and
was
leaning
over
the
beckoning
frantically
to
a
figure
mounted
on
one
of
the
girders
of
the
bridge
it
was
a
grotesque
vagabond
figure
in
rags
a
battered
cap
on
the
back
of
its
head
good
god
muttered
the
man
in
the
car
stiffening
luckily
for
the
tinker
the
car
was
running
again
at
a
moderate
speed
the
man
had
slowed
up
when
he
saw
the
rough
planking
over
the
bridge
and
his
hand
had
not
time
enough
to
reach
the
lever
when
the
tinker
was
upon
him
the
car
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
patsy
sank
back
on
the
seat
white
and
trembling
as
she
watched
the
instant
grappling
of
the
two
followed
by
a
lurching
tumble
over
the
side
of
the
car
to
the
planking
the
fall
knocked
them
apart
and
for
the
space
of
a
few
quick
breaths
they
half
rose
and
faced
each
other
the
one
almost
crazed
with
fury
the
other
steady
calm
but
terrifyingly
determined
before
patsy
could
move
they
were
upon
each
other
again
rolling
about
in
the
dust
clutching
at
each
other
throat
now
half
under
the
car
now
almost
through
the
girders
of
the
bridge
with
voice
crying
a
warning
again
they
were
on
their
feet
grappling
and
hitting
blindly
then
down
in
the
dust
rolling
and
clutching
it
was
plain
melodrama
of
the
most
banal
form
and
the
most
convincing
part
of
it
all
was
the
evident
personal
enmity
that
directed
each
blow
somehow
it
was
borne
in
upon
patsy
that
her
share
in
the
quarrel
was
an
infinitesimal
part
it
was
the
old
old
scene
in
the
fourth
act
the
hero
paying
up
the
villain
for
all
past
scores
like
the
scene
in
the
fourth
act
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
the
time
came
when
no
answering
blow
met
the
tinker
when
the
hand
that
gripped
his
throat
relaxed
and
the
body
back
of
it
went
down
under
him
breathless
and
inert
patsy
climbed
out
of
the
car
to
make
room
for
the
stowing
away
of
its
owner
he
was
conscious
but
past
articulate
speech
and
thoroughly
beaten
and
the
tinker
kindly
turned
the
car
about
for
him
and
started
him
slowly
off
so
as
to
rid
the
road
of
him
as
patsy
said
it
looked
possible
with
a
careful
harboring
of
strength
and
persistence
for
him
to
reach
eventually
the
and
his
friend
of
the
as
his
trail
of
dust
lengthened
between
them
patsy
gave
a
sigh
of
relieved
content
and
turned
to
the
tinker
faith
ye
are
a
sight
for
a
sore
heart
her
hand
slid
into
his
outstretched
one
i
make
a
bargain
with
ye
if
ye
forgive
and
forget
the
unfair
things
i
said
to
ye
that
night
i
not
stay
hurt
over
your
leaving
without
notice
the
next
morning
it
a
bargain
but
he
winced
as
he
said
it
it
seems
as
if
our
meetings
were
dependent
on
a
certain
amount
of
of
physical
disablement
he
smiled
reassuringly
i
do
really
mind
in
the
least
i
stand
for
knockout
blows
down
miles
of
road
if
they
would
bring
you
back
every
time
do
joke
patsy
covered
her
face
if
if
ye
only
knew
what
it
means
to
have
ye
standing
there
this
minute
she
drew
in
her
breath
quickly
it
sounded
dangerously
like
a
sob
if
ye
only
knew
what
ye
have
saved
me
from
and
what
i
am
owing
ye
her
hands
fell
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
shy
concern
poor
lad
here
ye
are
a
fit
subject
for
a
hospital
and
i
wasting
time
talking
instead
of
trying
to
mend
ye
up
do
ye
think
there
might
be
water
hereabouts
where
we
could
wash
off
some
of
that
grease
paint
but
the
tinker
was
contemplating
his
right
foot
he
was
standing
on
the
other
do
bother
about
those
scratches
they
go
rather
well
with
the
clothes
do
you
think
it
this
ankle
that
bothering
me
i
must
have
turned
it
when
i
jumped
ca
ye
walk
on
it
ye
can
lean
on
this
she
passed
him
the
pilgrim
staff
and
we
can
go
slowly
bad
luck
to
the
man
if
i
had
known
ye
were
hurt
i
have
made
ye
leave
him
in
the
road
and
have
driven
his
machine
back
to
arden
for
him
she
looked
longingly
after
the
trail
of
dust
your
ethics
are
questionable
but
your
geography
is
worse
arden
is
back
there
what
do
ye
mean
why
i
saw
arden
back
yonder
with
my
own
eyes
not
an
hour
ago
no
you
did
you
saw
dansville
arden
is
over
there
and
the
tinker
hand
pointed
over
his
shoulder
at
right
angles
to
the
road
holy
saint
branden
gasped
patsy
maybe
ye
have
the
boldness
then
to
tell
me
i
still
seven
miles
from
it
you
are
but
this
time
he
did
not
laugh
a
smile
was
the
utmost
he
could
manage
with
the
pain
in
his
ankle
patsy
looked
as
if
she
might
have
laughed
or
cried
with
equal
ease
seven
miles
seven
miles
tramp
the
road
for
four
days
and
be
just
as
near
the
end
as
i
was
at
the
start
an
expression
of
enlightenment
shot
into
her
face
faith
i
must
have
been
going
in
a
circle
then
the
tinker
nodded
an
affirmative
and
who
in
the
name
of
reason
was
the
man
in
the
car
that
what
i
like
to
know
the
unmitigated
nerve
of
him
he
finished
to
himself
his
chin
set
itself
squarely
his
face
had
grown
as
white
as
patsy
had
been
and
his
eyes
became
doggedly
determined
if
it
is
a
piece
of
impertinence
i
like
to
ask
how
you
happened
to
be
with
him
that
way
patsy
flushed
i
thinking
ye
earned
the
right
to
an
answer
i
took
him
for
the
lad
i
was
looking
for
i
thought
the
place
was
arden
and
and
the
clothes
were
the
same
the
clothes
the
tinker
repeated
it
in
the
same
bewildered
way
that
had
been
his
when
patsy
first
found
him
then
he
turned
and
grasped
patsy
shoulders
with
a
sudden
inexplicable
intensity
what
the
name
of
the
lad
the
lad
you
after
i
tell
you
said
patsy
slowly
if
you
tell
me
what
you
did
with
my
brown
clothes
that
morning
before
you
left
and
the
answer
to
both
questions
was
a
blank
baffling
stare
xii
a
change
of
nationality
the
railroad
ran
under
the
patsy
could
see
the
station
not
an
eighth
of
a
mile
down
the
track
and
she
made
for
it
as
being
the
nearest
possible
point
where
water
might
be
procured
the
gave
her
a
tin
can
and
filled
it
for
her
and
ten
minutes
later
she
set
about
scrubbing
the
tinker
free
of
all
the
telltale
of
melodrama
it
was
accomplished
after
a
fashion
and
with
persistent
rebelling
on
the
tinker
part
and
scolding
on
patsy
and
finally
to
prove
his
own
supreme
indifference
to
physical
disablement
he
tore
the
can
from
her
administering
hands
threw
it
over
the
bridge
and
started
down
the
road
at
his
old
swinging
stride
is
it
after
more
ye
dandering
called
patsy
more
likely
it
after
a
pair
of
those
wingèd
shoes
of
perseus
need
them
but
his
stride
soon
broke
to
a
walk
and
then
to
a
lagging
limp
it
no
use
he
said
at
last
i
might
keep
on
for
another
a
mile
at
the
most
but
that
about
all
i
be
good
for
you
have
to
go
on
to
arden
alone
and
you
ca
miss
it
this
time
patsy
stopped
abruptly
why
do
ye
curse
me
for
the
trouble
i
have
brought
she
considered
both
hands
carefully
for
a
minute
as
if
she
expected
to
find
in
them
the
solution
to
the
difficulty
then
she
looked
up
and
away
toward
the
rising
woodland
that
marked
arden
do
ye
know
she
said
wistfully
i
took
the
road
thinking
i
could
mend
trouble
for
that
other
lad
and
instead
it
trouble
i
been
making
for
every
one
ye
joseph
and
i
do
know
how
many
more
and
instead
of
doling
kindness
why
i
begging
it
now
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
what
keeps
me
failing
a
divinity
that
shapes
began
the
tinker
but
patsy
cut
him
short
ye
do
know
willie
shakespeare
he
smiled
guiltily
i
afraid
i
do
known
him
a
good
many
years
he
grand
company
best
i
know
barring
tinkers
she
turned
impulsively
and
standing
on
tiptoe
her
fingers
reached
to
the
top
of
his
shoulders
see
here
lad
ye
can
just
give
over
thinking
i
go
on
alone
if
i
cast
for
melodrama
sure
i
play
it
according
to
the
best
rules
the
villain
has
fled
the
hero
is
hurt
and
if
i
went
now
i
be
hissed
by
the
gallery
i
got
ye
into
trouble
and
i
not
leave
ye
till
i
see
ye
out
of
it
someway
oh
there
lots
of
ways
i
thinking
them
fast
like
as
not
a
passing
team
or
car
would
carry
ye
to
arden
or
we
might
beg
the
loan
of
a
horse
for
a
bit
from
some
farmer
and
i
could
drive
ye
over
and
bring
the
horse
back
or
we
ask
a
corner
for
ye
at
a
till
ye
are
fit
to
walk
we
are
in
the
wrong
part
of
the
country
for
any
of
those
things
to
happen
look
about
do
you
see
what
a
very
different
road
it
is
from
the
one
we
took
in
the
beginning
patsy
looked
and
saw
so
engrossed
had
she
been
in
the
incidents
of
the
last
hour
or
more
that
she
had
not
observed
the
changing
country
here
were
no
longer
pastures
tilled
fields
houses
with
neighboring
and
unclaimed
woodland
no
longer
was
the
road
fringed
with
stone
walls
or
stump
fencing
stretched
away
on
either
hand
as
far
as
they
could
see
and
beyond
through
the
trees
showed
roofs
of
red
tile
and
stained
shingle
and
trimmed
hedges
skirted
everything
is
the
rich
man
country
commented
patsy
it
is
and
i
crawl
into
a
hole
and
starve
before
i
take
charity
from
one
of
them
sure
and
ye
would
when
a
body
poor
is
only
the
poor
like
himself
he
be
asking
help
of
do
i
know
what
yonder
house
she
broke
off
with
a
jerk
and
pointed
ahead
to
a
small
building
sitting
well
back
from
the
road
partly
hidden
in
the
surrounding
clumps
of
trees
it
a
stable
house
burned
down
last
year
and
it
has
been
used
by
any
one
since
and
i
wager
it
as
snug
as
a
pocket
inside
with
fresh
hay
or
straw
plenty
to
make
a
lad
comfortable
is
that
grand
good
luck
for
ye
the
tinker
found
it
hard
to
echo
patsy
enthusiasm
but
he
did
his
best
of
course
and
it
just
the
place
to
leave
a
lad
behind
in
when
a
lass
has
seven
miles
to
tramp
before
she
gets
to
the
end
of
her
journey
is
that
so
patsy
tone
sounded
suspiciously
sarcastic
well
talking
not
walking
supposing
ye
take
the
staff
in
one
hand
and
lean
your
other
on
me
and
we
see
can
we
make
it
before
this
time
they
made
it
in
another
hour
unobserved
by
the
few
straggling
players
on
the
links
the
stable
proved
all
patsy
had
anticipated
she
watched
the
tinker
sink
exhausted
on
the
bedded
hay
while
she
pulled
down
a
forgotten
from
a
peg
to
throw
over
him
then
she
turned
in
a
manner
back
to
the
door
are
you
going
to
arden
came
the
faint
voice
of
the
tinker
after
her
i
might
and
then
again
i
might
was
there
any
word
ye
might
want
me
to
fetch
ahead
for
ye
no
only
perhaps
would
you
think
a
chap
too
everlastingly
impertinent
to
ask
you
to
wait
there
for
him
until
he
caught
up
with
you
i
might
and
then
again
i
might
at
the
door
she
stopped
and
for
the
second
time
considered
her
hands
speculatively
it
inconvenience
your
feelings
any
to
take
charity
from
me
would
it
seeing
i
as
poor
as
yourself
and
have
dragged
ye
into
this
common
tuppenny
brawl
by
my
own
foolishness
you
did
drag
me
in
i
had
one
foot
in
already
i
thought
so
patsy
nodded
approvingly
her
conviction
had
been
correct
then
and
the
charity
yes
i
take
it
from
you
the
tinker
rolled
over
with
a
little
moan
composed
of
physical
pain
and
mental
discomfort
but
in
another
moment
he
was
sitting
upright
shaking
a
mandatory
fist
at
patsy
as
she
disappeared
through
the
door
remember
no
help
from
the
quality
i
hate
them
as
much
as
you
do
and
i
wo
have
them
coming
around
with
their
inquisitive
patronizing
supercilious
offers
of
assistance
to
a
beggar
i
tell
you
i
want
to
be
left
alone
if
you
bring
any
one
back
with
you
i
burn
the
stable
down
about
me
remember
aye
she
called
back
i
be
remembering
she
reached
the
road
again
and
for
the
manyeth
time
since
she
left
the
women
free
ward
of
the
city
hospital
she
marshaled
all
the
wits
but
even
the
best
of
wits
require
opportunity
and
to
patsy
the
immediate
outlook
seemed
barren
of
such
there
naught
to
do
but
keep
going
till
something
turns
up
she
said
to
herself
and
she
followed
this
micawber
advice
to
the
letter
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
grounds
which
had
belonged
to
the
burned
house
and
the
deserted
stable
she
passed
on
between
a
stretch
of
thin
woodland
and
a
grove
of
giant
pines
and
there
she
came
upon
a
she
looked
to
the
right
it
was
empty
she
looked
to
the
left
and
behold
there
was
opportunity
large
florid
and
agitated
coming
directly
toward
her
from
one
of
the
houses
and
puffing
audibly
under
the
combined
weight
of
herself
and
her
bag
ze
depôt
how
long
ees
eet
she
demanded
when
she
caught
sight
of
patsy
the
accent
was
unmistakably
french
and
patsy
obligingly
answered
her
in
her
i
can
not
say
exactly
about
three
four
kilometers
opportunity
dropped
her
bag
and
embraced
her
oh
she
burst
out
volubly
think
of
zoë
marat
finding
a
countrywoman
in
this
wild
land
i
can
no
longer
stand
it
and
when
madame
temper
goes
i
say
it
is
enough
let
madame
fast
or
cook
for
her
guests
as
she
prefer
i
go
bien
agreed
the
outer
patsy
while
her
subjective
consciousness
addressed
her
objective
self
in
plain
donegal
faith
this
is
the
maddest
luck
the
maddest
merriest
luck
if
yonder
quality
house
has
lost
one
cook
be
needing
another
and
is
a
poor
cook
entirely
that
does
hold
the
keys
of
her
own
pantry
food
from
quality
house
need
be
choking
the
maddest
tinker
if
it
paid
for
in
honest
work
having
been
embraced
by
opportunity
patsy
saw
no
reason
for
wasting
time
in
futile
sympathy
that
might
better
be
spent
in
prompt
execution
she
despatched
the
woman
to
the
station
with
the
briefest
of
directions
and
herself
made
straight
for
quality
house
she
was
smiling
over
her
appearance
and
the
incongruities
of
the
situation
as
she
rang
the
bell
at
the
front
door
and
asked
for
madame
in
her
best
parisien
the
maid
properly
impressed
carried
the
message
at
once
and
curiosity
brought
madame
in
surprising
haste
to
the
hall
where
she
looked
patsy
over
with
frank
amazement
madame
speak
french
ah
i
thought
so
madame
desires
a
cook
the
abruptness
of
this
announcement
turned
madame
giddy
how
did
you
know
mine
did
not
leave
half
an
hour
ago
there
is
another
french
cook
within
five
miles
it
is
unbelievable
it
is
providence
patsy
cast
her
eyes
devoutly
heavenward
you
have
references
references
patsy
shrugged
her
shoulders
contemptuously
what
would
madame
do
with
references
she
can
not
eat
them
she
can
not
feed
them
to
her
guests
i
can
cook
is
that
not
sufficient
but
you
do
not
think
it
is
impossible
that
i
ever
employ
a
servant
without
references
and
you
you
look
like
anything
in
the
world
but
a
french
cook
madame
is
not
so
foolish
as
to
find
fault
with
the
ways
of
providence
or
judge
one
by
one
clothes
who
knows
at
this
moment
it
may
be
la
in
paris
for
cooks
to
wear
sailor
blouses
besides
madame
is
mistaken
i
am
not
a
servant
i
am
an
artist
a
culinary
artist
you
can
cook
truly
but
yes
madame
excellent
sauces
béchamel
hollandaise
maître
espagnole
béarnaise
patsy
completed
the
list
with
an
ecstatic
kiss
blown
into
the
air
madame
sighed
and
spoke
in
english
it
is
unbelievable
absurd
i
should
trust
my
own
eyes
or
palate
if
i
sat
down
to
the
most
remarkable
dinner
in
the
world
but
one
must
feed
one
guests
she
looked
patsy
over
again
your
trunk
trunk
is
it
toilettes
or
sauces
madame
wishes
me
to
make
for
her
guests
foi
trunks
references
one
is
as
unimportant
as
the
other
is
it
not
enough
for
the
present
if
i
cook
for
madame
afterward
she
ended
with
the
shrug
evidently
madame
conceded
the
point
for
without
further
comment
she
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
and
presented
the
bill
of
fare
for
dinner
twelve
read
patsy
and
is
sunday
ah
providence
is
good
to
madame
but
madame
thoughts
were
on
more
practical
matters
your
wages
one
hundred
francs
a
week
and
the
kitchen
to
myself
i
too
have
a
temper
madame
patsy
gave
a
quick
toss
to
her
head
while
her
eyes
snapped
that
night
the
guests
at
quality
house
sat
over
their
coffee
volubly
commenting
on
the
rare
excellence
of
their
dinner
and
the
good
fortune
of
their
hostess
in
her
possession
of
such
a
cook
madame
kept
her
own
counsel
and
blessed
providence
but
she
did
not
allow
that
good
fortune
to
escape
with
her
better
judgment
or
anything
else
she
ordered
the
butler
before
retiring
to
count
the
silver
and
lock
it
in
her
this
was
to
be
done
every
night
as
long
as
the
new
cook
remained
and
the
new
cook
her
work
despatched
and
her
kitchen
to
herself
she
was
free
to
get
dinner
for
one
more
of
madame
guests
faith
he
die
of
a
black
fit
if
he
ever
knew
he
was
a
guest
of
quality
house
and
she
die
of
another
if
she
found
out
whom
she
was
entertaining
but
glory
be
to
peter
what
neither
of
them
knows
wo
hurt
them
and
patsy
unobserved
opened
the
back
door
and
retraced
the
road
to
the
deserted
stable
with
a
full
basket
and
a
glad
heart
she
found
the
tinker
under
some
trees
at
the
back
smoking
a
disreputable
cuddy
pipe
with
a
worse
accompaniment
of
tobacco
when
he
saw
her
he
removed
it
apologetically
it
smells
horrible
i
know
i
found
it
forgotten
on
a
ledge
of
the
stable
but
it
keeps
a
chap
from
remembering
that
he
is
hungry
poor
lad
patsy
knelt
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
opened
her
basket
put
your
nose
into
that
just
is
a
dinner
and
every
bit
of
the
best
faith
is
lucky
i
was
found
on
a
brittany
instead
of
one
in
heidelberg
birmingham
or
philadelphia
and
if
ye
ca
be
born
with
gold
in
your
mouth
the
next
best
thing
is
a
meaning
queried
the
tinker
meaning
that
there
many
a
poor
soul
who
goes
hungry
through
life
because
she
is
wanting
the
knowledge
of
how
to
mix
what
already
under
her
nose
the
tinker
looked
suspiciously
from
the
contents
of
the
basket
to
patsy
kneeling
beside
it
and
he
dropped
into
a
shameless
mimicry
of
her
brogue
aye
but
how
did
she
come
by
what
under
her
nose
here
a
dinner
for
a
king
son
well
i
be
letting
ye
play
the
king
son
instead
of
the
fool
just
if
ye
give
over
asking
any
more
questions
and
eat
but
he
sniffed
the
plate
she
had
handed
him
with
added
suspicion
roast
duck
and
sherry
sauce
honest
now
have
ye
been
begging
no
nor
stealing
nor
by
the
same
token
have
i
murdered
any
one
to
get
the
dinner
from
him
there
was
fine
sarcasm
in
her
voice
as
she
returned
the
tinker
searching
look
then
where
did
it
come
from
i
not
eat
a
mouthful
until
i
get
an
honest
answer
the
tinker
put
the
plate
down
beside
him
and
folded
his
arms
patsy
snorted
with
exasperation
was
i
ever
saying
ye
could
play
the
king
son
faith
ye
never
play
anything
but
the
fool
first
and
last
her
voice
suddenly
took
on
a
more
coaxing
tone
she
was
thinking
of
that
good
dinner
growing
cold
spoiled
by
the
ridiculous
curiosity
i
tell
ye
what
if
ye
agree
to
begin
eating
i
agree
to
begin
telling
ye
about
it
and
we
both
agree
not
to
stop
till
we
get
to
the
end
but
holy
saint
martin
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
before
letting
his
conscience
in
ahead
of
his
hunger
the
bargain
was
made
and
while
the
tinker
devoured
one
plateful
after
another
with
a
ravenous
haste
that
almost
discredited
his
previous
restraint
patsy
spun
a
fanciful
tale
of
having
found
a
cluricaun
under
a
with
great
elaboration
and
seeming
regard
for
the
truth
she
explained
his
magical
qualities
and
how
if
you
were
clever
enough
to
possess
yourself
of
his
cap
you
could
get
almost
anything
from
him
i
held
his
cap
firmly
with
the
one
hand
and
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
with
the
other
and
says
i
to
him
man
ye
not
be
getting
this
back
till
ye
fetched
me
a
dinner
fit
for
a
tinker
and
good
says
he
ye
ca
find
that
this
side
of
the
king
hotel
dublin
and
that
will
take
time
the
time
says
i
get
the
dinner
and
from
that
minute
till
the
present
been
waiting
under
that
for
him
to
make
the
trip
there
and
back
patsy
finished
and
the
two
of
them
smiled
at
each
other
with
rare
good
humor
out
under
the
june
stars
only
the
tinker
smile
was
skeptical
so
ye
are
not
believing
me
patsy
shammed
a
solemn
grieved
look
well
i
forgive
ye
this
time
if
ye
agree
that
the
dinner
was
good
for
i
hate
like
the
devil
to
be
giving
the
wee
man
back
his
cap
for
anything
but
the
best
with
laggard
grace
the
tinker
stretched
his
hands
over
the
now
empty
basket
and
gripped
patsy
lass
lass
what
are
you
thinking
of
me
faith
my
manners
are
more
ragged
than
my
clothes
and
i
not
fit
to
be
a
tinker
the
dinner
was
the
best
i
ever
ate
and
bless
ye
and
the
cluricaun
patsy
cooked
for
three
days
at
quality
house
that
the
tinker
might
feast
night
and
morning
to
his
heart
content
while
his
ankle
slowly
mended
but
he
still
persisted
questioning
concerning
his
food
where
and
how
patsy
had
come
by
it
she
still
maintained
as
persistent
a
silence
i
come
by
it
honestly
and
is
no
charity
fare
was
the
most
she
would
say
adding
by
way
of
flavor
for
a
sorry
tinker
ye
are
the
proudest
i
ever
saw
did
ye
ever
know
another
now
who
wanted
a
written
certificate
of
moral
character
along
with
every
morsel
he
ate
according
to
wage
agreement
she
had
the
kitchen
to
herself
no
one
entered
except
on
matters
of
necessity
no
one
lingered
after
her
work
was
despatched
madame
came
twice
daily
to
confer
with
patsy
on
intricacies
of
gestation
while
she
beamed
upon
her
as
a
probationed
soul
might
look
upon
the
keeper
of
the
keys
of
paradise
but
the
days
held
more
for
patsy
than
sauces
and
entrées
and
pastries
they
held
gossip
as
well
soupçons
were
served
up
on
loosened
tongues
borne
in
through
open
window
and
swinging
door
straight
from
the
and
my
lady
chamber
most
of
it
passed
her
ears
unheeded
it
was
but
a
droning
accompaniment
to
her
measuring
mixing
rolling
and
baking
until
news
came
at
last
that
concerned
herself
gossip
of
the
burgemans
father
and
son
the
butler
and
the
parlor
maid
were
cleaning
the
silver
in
the
pantry
and
the
slide
was
raised
as
transmitters
of
gossip
they
were
more
than
usually
concerned
for
had
not
the
butler
at
one
time
served
in
the
house
of
burgeman
and
the
maid
dusted
next
door
therefore
every
item
of
news
was
well
ripened
before
it
dropped
from
either
tongue
and
patsy
gathered
them
in
with
eager
ears
the
master
of
quality
house
happened
to
be
a
director
of
that
bank
on
which
the
burgeman
check
of
ten
thousand
had
been
drawn
it
had
been
the
largest
check
drawn
to
cash
presented
at
the
bank
and
the
teller
had
confessed
to
the
directors
that
he
would
never
have
paid
over
the
money
to
any
one
except
the
old
man
son
in
fact
he
had
been
so
much
concerned
over
it
afterward
that
he
had
called
up
the
burgeman
office
and
had
been
much
relieved
to
have
the
assurance
of
the
secretary
that
the
check
was
certified
and
perfectly
correct
not
a
second
thought
would
have
been
given
to
the
matter
had
not
the
secretary
resignation
been
made
public
the
next
day
the
day
billy
burgeman
disappeared
patsy
ears
fairly
bristled
with
interest
that
news
if
it
is
gossip
where
is
the
secretary
now
and
which
of
them
has
the
ten
thousand
the
director
had
touched
on
the
subject
of
the
check
the
next
day
when
business
had
demanded
his
presence
at
the
burgeman
home
the
result
had
been
distinctly
baffling
not
that
the
director
could
put
his
finger
on
any
one
suspicious
point
in
the
behavior
of
burgeman
senior
but
it
left
him
with
the
distinct
impression
that
the
father
was
shielding
the
son
aye
that
what
billy
said
his
father
would
do
shield
him
out
of
pride
patsy
dusted
the
flour
from
her
arms
and
stood
motionless
thinking
burgeman
senior
had
offered
only
one
remark
to
the
director
given
cynically
with
a
nervous
jerking
of
the
shoulders
and
twitching
of
the
hands
he
was
needing
a
small
sum
to
keep
him
in
and
i
dare
say
that
the
way
rich
sons
keep
their
fathers
incomes
from
getting
too
cumbersome
burgeman
senior
had
been
ill
then
confined
to
his
room
but
the
next
day
his
condition
had
become
alarming
he
was
now
dying
at
his
home
in
arden
and
his
son
could
not
be
found
these
last
two
statements
were
not
merely
gossip
but
facts
patsy
listened
impatiently
to
the
parlor
maid
arguing
the
matter
of
billy
guilt
with
the
butler
their
work
was
finished
and
they
were
passing
through
the
kitchen
on
their
way
to
the
servants
hall
of
course
he
took
it
the
maid
tone
was
positive
those
rich
men
sons
always
are
a
bad
lot
did
take
it
then
father
playin
some
mean
game
on
that
what
hi
worked
five
months
hin
that
an
hi
as
lief
work
for
the
devil
and
the
butler
pounded
his
fist
for
emphasis
it
took
all
patsy
to
refrain
from
launching
into
the
argument
herself
and
that
in
the
irish
tongue
she
saved
herself
however
by
resorting
to
that
temper
of
which
she
had
boasted
and
hurled
at
the
two
a
torrent
of
words
which
sounded
to
them
like
the
most
horrible
pagan
blasphemy
and
from
which
they
fled
in
genuine
horror
in
reality
it
was
the
names
of
all
the
places
in
france
that
patsy
could
recall
with
rapidity
when
the
kitchen
was
empty
once
more
patsy
systematically
gathered
together
all
that
she
knew
and
all
that
she
had
heard
of
billy
burgeman
and
weighed
it
against
the
bare
possible
chance
she
might
have
of
helping
him
should
she
continue
her
quest
and
in
the
end
she
made
her
decision
unwaveringly
troth
a
conscience
is
a
poor
bit
of
property
entirely
she
sighed
as
she
stood
the
on
the
ledge
of
the
range
to
dry
it
drives
ye
after
a
man
ye
do
care
a
about
and
it
drives
ye
from
the
one
that
ye
do
bad
luck
to
it
that
night
patsy
sat
under
the
trees
with
the
tinker
while
he
ate
his
supper
a
moon
lighted
the
feast
for
them
for
patsy
took
an
occasional
mouthful
at
the
tinker
insistence
that
dining
alone
was
a
miserably
unsociable
affair
to
watch
ye
eat
that
pâté
de
fois
gras
a
body
would
think
ye
had
been
reared
on
them
honest
now
have
ye
ever
tasted
one
before
in
your
life
i
have
then
ye
have
sat
at
rich
men
tables
or
perhaps
i
have
begged
at
rich
men
doors
maybe
that
is
how
i
came
to
have
a
distaste
for
their
charity
who
are
ye
ye
know
i
give
the
full
of
my
empty
pockets
to
know
who
ye
are
and
what
started
ye
tramping
the
road
in
rags
the
tinker
considered
a
moment
perhaps
i
took
the
road
because
i
believed
it
led
to
the
only
place
i
cared
to
find
perhaps
i
lost
the
way
to
it
as
you
lost
yours
to
arden
and
in
the
losing
i
found
something
else
perhaps
perhaps
oh
perhaps
a
hundred
things
but
i
make
another
bargain
with
you
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
we
reach
arden
if
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
lad
you
came
to
find
i
do
more
than
that
i
bring
ye
together
and
let
ye
help
mend
him
and
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
to
clinch
the
bargain
they
sat
in
silence
under
the
spattering
of
moonlight
that
sifted
down
through
the
branches
for
the
moment
the
tinker
had
forgotten
his
hunger
well
queried
patsy
at
last
a
for
them
i
thinking
the
same
old
thoughts
i
thought
a
hundred
times
already
since
that
first
day
what
makes
you
so
different
from
everybody
else
what
ever
sent
you
out
into
the
world
with
your
gospel
of
kindness
on
your
lips
and
in
your
hands
would
ye
really
like
to
know
patsy
fingers
stole
through
the
grass
about
them
faith
the
world
not
so
soft
and
green
as
this
under
every
one
feet
ye
see
was
by
a
thorn
i
was
found
hanging
to
that
killarney
in
brittany
and
i
always
remembered
the
feeling
of
it
i
always
suspected
that
the
people
who
fell
heir
to
stinging
memories
generally
went
through
life
hugging
their
own
troubles
and
letting
the
rest
of
the
world
hug
theirs
i
do
believe
it
patsy
shook
her
head
fiercely
what
the
use
of
all
the
pain
and
sorrow
and
trouble
scattered
about
everywhere
if
it
ca
put
a
cure
for
others
into
the
hands
of
those
who
have
first
tasted
it
and
what
better
cure
can
ye
find
than
kindness
is
it
the
best
thing
in
the
world
is
it
can
it
cure
gold
and
why
not
if
every
man
had
more
kindness
than
he
had
gold
would
neighbor
ever
have
to
fear
neighbor
or
childther
go
hungry
for
love
the
tinker
did
not
answer
and
patsy
went
on
with
a
deepening
intensity
i
tell
ye
a
tale
a
foolish
tale
that
keeps
repeating
itself
over
and
over
in
my
memory
like
the
of
a
clock
ye
know
that
the
jesuit
fathers
say
give
them
the
care
of
a
child
till
he
ten
and
nothing
afterward
matters
well
it
true
a
child
can
feel
all
the
sweetness
or
bitterness
hunger
or
plenty
that
life
holds
before
he
is
that
age
even
patsy
stopped
a
veery
was
singing
in
the
woods
close
by
and
she
listened
for
a
moment
hearken
to
that
bird
now
a
lad
may
have
stolen
his
nest
or
a
cat
filched
his
young
or
his
sons
and
daughters
flown
away
and
left
him
but
he
sing
for
all
that
is
a
pity
the
rest
of
us
ca
do
as
well
yes
agreed
the
tinker
but
the
story
aye
the
story
it
begins
with
a
wee
white
cottage
in
brittany
fronted
by
roses
and
backed
by
great
cliffs
and
the
open
sea
patsy
clasped
her
hands
about
her
knees
while
her
eyes
left
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
traveled
to
the
open
where
the
moonlight
spread
silvery
clear
and
unbroken
and
the
tinker
watching
knew
that
her
eyes
were
seeing
the
things
of
which
she
was
telling
a
wee
white
cottage
the
roses
and
the
cliffs
repeated
patsy
and
a
great
grim
silent
figure
of
a
man
sitting
there
idle
all
day
watching
a
little
lass
at
her
play
just
the
man
and
the
child
and
the
trouble
in
his
mind
that
had
kept
the
man
silent
and
idle
was
an
old
old
trouble
old
as
the
peopled
world
itself
long
before
he
had
married
a
woman
who
cared
for
two
things
love
and
gold
and
he
had
but
the
one
to
give
her
she
had
been
a
great
actress
a
favorite
at
the
comédie
française
but
she
left
her
work
and
all
the
applause
and
adulation
for
him
an
expatriated
irishman
with
naught
but
a
great
love
because
she
thought
she
cared
for
love
more
they
had
been
wonderfully
happy
at
first
he
wrote
beautiful
verses
about
her
and
his
beloved
motherland
and
she
said
them
for
him
in
that
wonderful
singing
voice
of
hers
that
had
made
her
the
idol
of
half
of
france
and
she
had
made
a
game
of
their
poverty
in
the
wee
white
cottage
with
the
roses
until
her
child
was
born
and
poverty
could
no
longer
be
played
at
then
work
became
drudgery
and
love
naught
the
woman
went
back
to
her
theater
and
another
man
a
man
who
had
gold
and
the
child
grew
up
playing
alone
beside
the
silent
grim
irishman
then
one
day
the
child
played
with
no
one
by
to
watch
her
the
man
had
walked
over
the
cliff
and
forgot
ever
to
come
back
aye
and
the
child
played
on
till
dark
came
and
she
fell
asleep
there
on
the
under
the
roses
was
a
neighbor
passing
that
found
her
and
carried
her
home
to
put
to
bed
with
her
own
children
after
that
the
child
was
taken
away
to
a
convent
and
the
rich
children
called
her
pauvre
shared
their
gifts
with
her
and
bought
her
candles
that
she
might
make
a
to
bring
her
father
back
again
but
was
her
mother
it
brought
instead
patsy
stopped
again
to
listen
to
the
veery
he
was
not
singing
alone
now
and
she
smiled
wistfully
see
he
found
a
friend
a
comrade
to
sing
with
him
that
grand
then
she
went
back
to
the
story
the
child
was
taken
from
the
convent
in
the
night
and
by
servants
who
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
she
was
brought
a
long
way
to
a
château
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
beautiful
in
the
south
of
france
and
a
small
man
in
royal
clothes
met
her
at
the
door
and
carried
her
up
great
marble
stairs
to
a
chamber
lighted
by
two
tall
candles
just
they
stopped
on
the
threshold
for
a
breath
and
the
child
saw
that
a
woman
was
lying
in
the
canopied
bed
a
very
very
beautiful
woman
to
the
child
she
seemed
some
goddess
or
saint
is
the
child
said
the
man
and
the
woman
answered
réné
remember
you
promised
alone
after
that
the
man
left
them
together
the
dying
woman
and
her
child
ah
how
can
i
be
telling
you
the
way
she
fondled
and
caressed
her
how
starved
were
the
lips
that
touched
the
child
hair
cheeks
and
eyelids
and
when
her
strength
failed
she
drew
the
child
into
her
tired
arms
and
whispered
fragments
of
prayers
haunting
memories
pitiful
regrets
of
all
the
things
she
said
the
child
remembered
but
one
buys
plenty
for
the
body
but
nothing
for
the
heart
nothing
nothing
and
that
kept
repeating
itself
over
and
over
in
the
child
mind
she
remembered
it
all
through
the
night
after
they
had
taken
her
away
from
those
lifeless
arms
and
she
lay
awake
alone
in
a
terrifying
dark
room
she
remembered
it
all
through
the
long
day
when
she
sat
beside
the
gorgeous
catafalque
that
held
her
mother
and
watched
the
tall
candles
in
the
dim
chapel
burn
lower
and
lower
and
lower
and
that
was
why
she
refused
to
stay
afterward
and
be
taken
care
of
by
the
man
in
that
oldest
and
most
beautiful
château
instead
she
slipped
out
early
one
morning
before
any
one
was
awake
to
see
and
mark
the
way
she
went
it
is
unbelievable
sometimes
how
children
who
have
the
will
to
do
it
can
lose
themselves
and
so
this
child
alone
went
out
into
the
world
seeking
life
but
did
she
go
asked
the
tinker
aye
but
not
thank
god
and
wherever
the
child
went
she
carried
with
her
that
hatred
of
gold
mused
the
tinker
aye
why
not
she
had
learned
how
pitifully
little
it
was
worth
when
all
said
and
done
was
her
father
name
she
heard
last
on
her
mother
lips
and
it
was
their
child
she
prayed
for
with
her
dying
breath
patsy
sprang
to
her
feet
do
ye
see
the
moon
will
be
beating
me
to
bed
and
was
a
poor
tale
after
all
how
is
your
foot
better
much
better
would
ye
be
able
to
travel
on
it
the
tinker
shook
his
head
the
day
after
perhaps
well
keep
on
coaxing
it
good
night
and
she
had
picked
up
her
basket
and
was
gone
before
the
tinker
could
stumble
to
his
feet
when
the
tinker
woke
the
next
morning
the
basket
stood
just
inside
the
stable
door
linked
through
the
pilgrim
staff
on
investigation
it
proved
to
contain
his
breakfast
and
an
envelope
and
the
envelope
contained
a
bill
and
a
letter
which
read
dear
lad
i
be
well
on
the
road
when
you
get
this
and
with
a
tongue
in
my
head
and
luck
at
my
heels
please
god
i
reach
arden
this
time
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
use
the
money
or
too
proud
either
it
was
honestly
earned
and
the
charity
of
no
one
you
can
take
it
as
a
loan
or
a
gift
whichever
you
choose
anyhow
it
will
bring
you
after
me
faster
which
was
your
own
promise
yours
in
advance
surprise
disappointment
indignation
amusement
all
battled
for
the
upper
hand
but
it
was
a
very
different
emotion
from
any
of
these
which
finally
mastered
the
tinker
he
smoothed
the
bill
very
tenderly
between
his
hands
before
he
returned
it
to
the
envelope
but
he
did
something
more
than
smooth
the
envelope
and
meanwhile
patsy
tramped
the
road
to
arden
xiii
a
message
and
a
map
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
the
right
road
it
ran
straight
past
quality
house
to
arden
unbroken
but
for
graveled
driveways
leading
into
private
estates
patsy
traveled
it
at
a
snail
pace
now
that
arden
had
become
a
definitely
unavoidable
goal
she
was
more
loath
to
reach
it
than
she
had
been
on
any
of
the
seven
days
since
the
beginning
of
her
quest
however
the
quest
ended
whether
she
found
billy
burgeman
or
not
or
whether
there
was
any
need
now
of
finding
him
this
much
she
knew
for
her
the
road
ended
at
arden
what
lay
beyond
she
neither
tried
nor
cared
to
prophesy
was
it
not
enough
that
her
days
of
vagabondage
would
be
over
along
with
the
company
of
tinkers
and
such
like
there
might
be
an
answer
awaiting
her
to
the
letter
sent
from
lebanon
to
george
travis
in
that
case
she
could
in
all
probability
count
on
some
dependable
income
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
otherwise
there
were
her
wits
the
very
thought
of
them
wrung
a
pitiful
little
groan
from
patsy
faith
i
been
overworking
dan
legacy
long
enough
i
thinking
poor
wee
things
they
needing
rest
and
nourishment
for
a
while
and
she
patted
her
forehead
sympathetically
of
one
thing
she
was
certain
if
her
wits
must
still
serve
her
they
should
do
so
within
the
confines
of
some
respectable
community
in
other
words
she
would
settle
down
and
work
at
something
that
would
provide
her
with
bed
and
board
until
the
fall
bookings
began
and
the
road
and
the
tinker
would
become
as
a
dream
fading
with
the
summer
into
a
sweet
illusive
memory
and
a
photograph
patsy
felt
in
the
pocket
of
her
norfolk
for
the
latter
with
a
sudden
eagerness
it
had
been
forgotten
since
she
had
found
the
tinker
himself
but
now
that
the
road
was
lengthening
between
them
again
it
brought
her
a
surprising
amount
of
comfort
there
are
three
things
i
shall
have
to
be
asking
him
if
he
ever
fetches
up
in
arden
himself
mused
patsy
as
she
loitered
along
and
what
more
this
time
i
be
getting
an
answer
to
every
one
of
them
or
i
no
relation
of
dan
first
i
know
the
fate
of
the
brown
dress
he
had
a
rag
of
it
about
him
that
certain
next
there
that
breakfast
with
the
how
did
he
come
by
it
and
last
of
all
how
ever
did
this
picture
come
on
the
of
a
closed
cottage
where
he
knew
the
way
of
breaking
in
and
what
clothes
would
be
hanging
in
the
chamber
closets
is
all
too
great
a
mystery
why
miss
what
luck
patsy
had
been
so
deep
in
her
musing
that
a
horse
and
rider
had
come
upon
her
unnoticed
she
turned
quickly
to
see
the
rider
dismounting
just
back
of
her
it
was
gregory
jessup
the
top
o
the
morning
to
ye
she
broke
into
a
glad
laugh
blessing
that
luck
herself
which
had
broken
into
her
disquieting
thoughts
and
provided
at
least
fair
company
and
some
news
perhaps
she
held
out
her
hand
in
hearty
welcome
are
ye
so
early
or
down
so
late
i
might
ask
that
myself
is
it
the
habit
of
celebrated
irish
actresses
to
tramp
miles
between
and
breakfast
is
a
habit
more
likely
to
fasten
itself
on
french
cooks
thinking
and
patsy
smiled
then
how
is
a
man
to
account
for
you
he
best
not
try
i
a
mortial
poor
person
to
account
for
maybe
i
up
early
getting
my
lines
for
the
next
act
of
course
what
a
stupid
duffer
i
am
you
must
find
us
plain
plodding
americans
horribly
sometimes
do
you
patsy
shook
a
contradiction
it
your
turn
now
what
fetched
ye
abroad
at
this
hour
gregory
jessup
slipped
his
arm
through
the
horse
bridle
and
fell
into
step
with
her
principally
because
i
like
the
early
morning
better
than
any
other
part
of
the
day
it
fresh
and
sweet
and
unspoiled
like
some
irish
actresses
there
please
do
mind
my
crude
attempt
at
poetic
simile
for
patsy
eyes
had
snapped
dangerously
if
you
only
knew
how
rarely
poetry
or
compliments
ever
came
to
roost
on
this
dry
tongue
you
really
would
want
to
discourage
them
when
it
does
happen
besides
there
was
another
reason
for
my
being
up
a
downright
foolish
reason
gregory
jessup
accompanied
the
remark
with
a
downright
foolish
smile
and
then
lapsed
into
silence
in
this
fashion
they
walked
to
the
bend
of
the
road
where
another
graveled
driveway
branched
forth
and
here
the
horse
stopped
of
his
own
accord
and
whinnied
this
is
the
dempsy
carters
place
where
i
stopping
gregory
explained
aye
but
the
other
reason
patsy
reminded
him
her
eyes
friendly
once
more
oh
the
other
reason
i
told
you
it
was
a
foolish
one
he
stood
rubbing
his
horse
nose
and
looking
over
the
road
they
had
come
for
some
seconds
before
he
finally
confessed
to
it
it
billy
you
see
somehow
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
he
should
be
in
trouble
and
at
the
same
time
knowing
his
father
was
sick
dying
he
might
be
hanging
around
somewhere
near
here
uncertain
just
what
to
do
and
not
wanting
any
one
to
see
him
in
that
case
the
best
time
to
run
across
him
would
be
early
morning
before
the
rest
of
the
people
were
awake
and
up
do
you
think
so
it
sounds
more
sensible
than
foolish
but
i
do
think
ye
ever
find
him
that
way
if
he
was
clever
enough
to
let
the
earth
swallow
him
up
he
clever
enough
to
keep
swallowed
there
but
one
way
to
reach
him
and
it
been
in
my
mind
since
a
look
of
surprise
came
into
gregory
jessup
face
why
miss
i
had
no
idea
what
i
said
that
day
would
fasten
billy
on
your
mind
like
this
it
awfully
good
of
you
and
he
a
perfect
stranger
patsy
broke
in
with
a
whimsical
chuckle
aye
i
grown
overpartial
to
strangers
of
late
but
ye
hearken
to
me
ye
have
to
leave
a
sign
by
the
roadside
for
him
if
ye
want
to
reach
him
otherwise
he
see
ye
first
and
be
gone
before
ever
ye
know
he
about
what
kind
of
a
sign
faith
i
not
sure
of
that
yet
myself
it
must
be
something
that
will
put
trust
back
in
a
lad
and
tell
him
to
come
home
and
where
would
you
put
it
where
on
the
roadside
just
anywhere
along
the
road
he
used
to
tramping
gregory
jessup
face
lost
its
puzzled
frown
and
became
suddenly
illumined
with
an
inspiration
i
know
by
hec
i
got
it
that
path
that
runs
down
from
the
burgeman
estate
to
our
old
cottage
it
was
a
short
cut
for
us
kids
and
we
were
almost
the
only
ones
to
use
it
billy
would
be
far
more
likely
to
take
that
than
the
highroad
and
it
leads
to
the
burgeman
farm
too
run
by
an
old
couple
that
simply
adore
billy
he
might
go
there
when
he
would
go
anywhere
else
that
the
place
for
a
message
but
what
message
i
know
patsy
clapped
her
hands
have
ye
a
scrap
of
paper
anywheres
about
ye
and
a
pencil
hunting
through
the
pockets
of
his
gregory
jessup
discovered
a
business
letter
the
back
of
which
provided
ample
writing
space
and
the
stub
of
a
pencil
we
use
in
the
he
explained
if
these
will
do
here
a
desk
and
he
raised
the
end
of
his
saddle
supporting
it
with
a
large
expanse
of
palm
patsy
accepted
them
all
with
a
gracious
little
nod
and
spreading
the
paper
on
the
improvised
desk
she
wrote
quickly
if
it
do
come
to
pass
that
any
man
turn
ass
thinking
the
world
is
blind
and
trust
forsworn
mankind
ducdame
ducdame
ducdame
here
shall
he
find
both
trust
and
peace
of
mind
an
he
but
leave
all
foolishness
behind
with
apologies
to
willie
shakespeare
patsy
chuckled
again
as
she
returned
paper
and
pencil
to
their
owner
ye
put
it
somewhere
be
likely
to
look
furninst
something
that
would
naturally
take
his
notice
i
know
just
the
spot
and
they
in
blossom
now
too
i
fasten
it
to
a
rock
there
wedge
it
in
the
cracks
billy
wo
miss
it
if
he
comes
within
yards
of
the
place
he
grasped
patsy
hand
with
growing
fervor
that
gave
promise
of
developing
suddenly
into
almost
anything
you
a
brick
miss
a
solid
gold
brick
of
a
girl
and
i
wish
take
care
warned
patsy
ye
not
improving
as
fast
in
your
compliments
as
ye
might
and
there
no
poetry
in
gold
for
me
gregory
jessup
looked
puzzled
but
his
fervor
did
not
abate
one
whit
i
want
you
to
promise
me
if
you
ever
need
a
friend
if
there
is
anything
i
can
ever
do
ye
can
interrupted
patsy
and
ye
can
do
it
now
take
that
of
yours
and
draw
me
a
map
in
the
dust
there
of
the
country
hereabouts
ye
can
make
a
cross
for
arden
that
grand
now
where
would
ye
put
brambleside
inn
and
is
it
seven
miles
from
there
to
arden
gregory
nodded
an
affirmative
while
he
considered
patsy
with
grave
perplexity
patsy
saw
it
and
smiled
reassuringly
is
all
right
i
always
had
a
great
interest
entirely
to
know
the
geography
of
every
new
country
and
i
have
the
wits
to
discover
it
for
myself
now
where
would
ye
put
the
and
the
catholic
church
and
where
would
lebanon
be
aye
did
ye
ever
see
an
old
tabby
chasing
her
tail
faith
is
a
very
intelligent
spectacle
i
thinking
now
where
might
ye
put
the
where
ye
picked
me
up
with
the
dempsy
carters
and
dansville
and
the
railroad
bridge
and
the
golf
links
back
yonder
she
stood
for
many
minutes
studying
the
rough
chart
in
the
dust
at
her
feet
the
connecting
lines
of
roads
between
the
places
named
made
fully
a
hundred
and
twenty
degrees
of
a
circle
about
the
cross
marking
arden
and
as
chance
would
have
it
every
one
of
the
encircling
towns
measured
approximately
seven
miles
from
the
central
cross
patsy
smiled
and
the
smile
grew
to
a
chuckle
and
the
chuckle
to
a
long
rippling
laugh
patsy
was
forced
to
hold
her
sides
with
the
ache
of
it
i
know
ye
think
i
crazy
but
is
the
rarest
bit
of
humor
this
side
of
ireland
willie
shakespeare
himself
would
steal
it
if
he
could
to
put
in
one
of
his
comedies
there
is
just
one
thing
i
like
to
be
knowing
how
much
of
it
was
chance
and
how
much
was
the
tricks
of
a
tinker
i
do
think
i
understand
mumbled
gregory
jessup
of
course
ye
do
agreed
patsy
i
do
myself
but
there
one
thing
more
i
be
telling
ye
if
ye
swear
never
to
let
it
pass
your
lips
patsy
paused
for
dramatic
effect
while
gregory
jessup
bound
himself
twice
over
to
secrecy
well
she
said
at
length
is
this
if
i
had
the
road
to
travel
again
i
pray
to
saint
brendan
to
keep
my
feet
fast
to
the
wrong
turn
that
what
patsy
left
him
still
looking
after
her
in
a
puzzled
fashion
and
with
quickening
steps
she
passed
out
of
sight
but
once
again
did
she
stop
and
again
it
was
by
a
graveled
driveway
she
was
deep
in
green
memories
when
a
figure
in
nurse
uniform
coming
down
the
drive
caught
her
attention
she
was
immediately
reminded
of
two
facts
that
the
burgeman
estate
was
in
arden
and
that
burgeman
senior
was
dying
impulsively
she
turned
toward
the
nurse
is
burgeman
any
better
this
morning
we
hardly
expect
that
the
nurse
tone
was
cordial
but
professionally
cautious
i
know
patsy
nodded
wisely
as
if
she
had
been
following
the
case
professionally
herself
but
there
is
often
a
last
rallying
of
strength
is
there
sometimes
i
hardly
think
there
will
be
anything
very
lasting
in
burgeman
case
there
are
moments
now
when
his
strength
and
will
are
remarkably
vigorous
any
other
man
would
be
in
his
bed
oh
then
he
is
up
he
taken
about
on
a
wheeled
chair
or
cot
he
is
too
restless
to
stay
in
any
place
very
long
he
seems
more
contented
outdoors
where
he
can
watch
she
broke
off
abruptly
lovely
morning
is
it
she
turned
about
and
went
up
the
drive
again
patsy
watched
her
go
a
strange
brooding
look
in
her
eyes
so
he
likes
to
be
out
of
doors
best
where
he
can
be
watching
and
if
a
body
chanced
to
trespass
that
way
she
might
come
upon
him
sudden
like
and
stay
long
enough
to
set
him
would
it
be
too
late
now
i
wonder
she
resumed
her
way
and
her
memories
she
passed
a
more
driveways
and
she
climbed
a
hill
and
when
she
came
to
the
top
she
found
herself
looking
down
on
a
thickly
wooded
hamlet
spires
and
gabled
roofs
broke
the
foliage
here
and
there
and
on
the
rising
slope
beyond
towered
a
veritable
forest
patsy
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
hill
and
gazed
down
long
and
thoughtfully
at
last
she
flung
out
her
arms
in
an
impetuous
gesture
of
confirmation
while
the
old
whimsical
smile
crept
into
her
lips
now
am
i
in
arden
the
more
fool
i
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
in
a
better
place
but
travelers
must
be
content
and
taking
a
firm
grip
of
her
memories
her
wits
and
her
courage
she
went
down
the
hill
xiv
enter
king
midas
when
patsy
at
last
reached
arden
she
went
direct
to
the
and
was
there
confronted
by
a
huge
poster
occupying
an
entire
wall
the
sylvan
players
under
the
management
of
geo
travis
presenting
wm
shakespeare
comedy
as
you
like
it
in
the
forest
of
arden
on
the
estate
of
esq
the
date
given
was
wednesday
the
day
following
and
the
cast
registered
her
name
opposite
rosalind
so
that
the
answer
to
the
letter
i
wrote
and
a
grand
answer
it
is
and
that
the
meaning
of
janet
payne
remarks
and
i
never
guessed
it
she
heaved
the
faintest
wisp
of
a
sigh
it
might
have
been
pleasure
it
might
have
been
a
twinge
of
pain
and
i
to
be
playing
the
duke
daughter
after
all
at
the
end
of
the
road
she
went
to
the
general
delivery
and
asked
for
mail
the
clerk
responded
with
three
letters
patsy
almost
whistled
under
her
breath
retiring
to
a
corner
she
looked
them
over
and
opened
first
the
one
from
george
travis
dear
irish
patsy
you
are
a
lucky
beggar
and
so
am
i
here
comes
the
news
of
miriam
regis
illness
and
the
canceling
of
all
of
her
summer
engagements
in
the
same
mail
as
your
letter
just
think
of
it
here
you
are
actually
in
arden
all
ready
for
me
to
pick
up
and
put
in
miriam
place
without
having
to
budge
from
my
desk
the
sylvan
players
open
with
as
you
like
it
if
the
critics
like
it
and
you
as
well
as
i
think
they
will
i
book
you
straight
through
the
summer
felton
managing
for
me
so
please
report
to
him
on
monday
when
he
gets
there
i
may
run
down
myself
for
a
glimpse
of
your
work
yours
travis
more
good
luck
we
are
just
in
time
to
get
your
name
on
the
posters
and
unless
my
memory
greatly
deceives
me
you
will
be
able
to
walk
right
into
all
of
costumes
aye
they
fit
agreed
patsy
with
a
chuckle
the
second
letter
was
from
felton
dated
monday
he
was
worried
over
her
continued
absence
he
had
not
found
her
registered
at
either
of
the
two
hotels
and
the
postal
clerk
reported
her
mail
uncalled
for
would
she
come
to
the
hillcrest
hotel
at
once
the
third
was
from
janet
payne
expressing
her
grief
over
joseph
death
and
their
disappointment
at
finding
her
gone
the
next
morning
when
they
motored
over
to
take
her
to
arden
they
were
all
looking
forward
to
seeing
her
play
on
wednesday
patsy
returned
the
letters
to
their
envelopes
and
marveled
that
her
prosperity
should
affect
her
so
drearily
why
was
she
not
elated
transported
with
the
surprise
and
the
sudden
promise
of
success
she
was
free
to
go
now
to
a
good
hotel
and
sign
for
a
room
and
three
regular
meals
a
day
she
could
wire
at
once
to
miss
gibbs
of
the
select
and
have
her
trunk
down
in
hours
in
very
truth
her
days
of
vagabondage
were
over
yet
the
fact
brought
her
no
happiness
she
hunted
felton
up
at
the
hotel
and
explained
her
absence
just
a
at
one
of
the
fashionable
places
no
not
exactly
professional
no
not
social
either
you
might
call
it
providential
like
this
the
morning
was
spent
meeting
her
going
over
the
text
trying
on
the
regis
costumes
adjourning
at
last
to
the
estate
of
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
were
busy
with
rehearsals
the
mental
tabulating
of
new
stage
business
the
adapting
of
strange
stage
property
the
accustoming
of
one
feet
to
tread
gracefully
over
roots
and
tangling
vines
and
slippery
patches
of
pine
needles
instead
of
a
good
stage
flooring
and
through
all
this
maze
mind
played
truant
a
score
of
times
it
raced
off
back
to
the
road
again
to
wait
between
a
stretch
of
woodland
and
a
grove
of
giant
pines
for
the
coming
of
a
grotesque
vagabond
figure
in
rags
come
come
miss
what
the
matter
felton
usual
patience
snapped
under
the
strain
of
her
persistent
i
had
to
tell
you
to
change
that
entrance
three
times
aye
and
what
is
the
matter
patsy
repeated
the
question
remorsefully
maybe
i
acquired
the
habit
of
taking
the
wrong
entrance
what
can
you
expect
from
any
one
taking
seven
days
to
go
seven
miles
i
dreadfully
sorry
if
you
only
let
me
off
this
time
i
promise
to
remember
i
promise
the
day
had
been
growing
steadily
hotter
and
more
sultry
by
five
every
one
who
was
doing
anything
and
could
stop
doing
it
went
slothfully
about
looking
for
cool
spots
and
cooler
drinks
burgeman
senior
alone
with
his
servants
on
the
largest
estate
in
arden
ordered
one
of
the
nurses
to
wheel
him
to
the
border
of
his
own
private
lake
a
place
where
breezes
blew
if
there
were
any
about
and
leave
him
there
alone
until
fitzpatrick
his
lawyer
came
from
town
and
there
he
was
sitting
his
eyes
on
nothing
at
all
when
patsy
scrambled
up
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
dropped
breathless
under
a
tree
not
three
feet
from
him
merciful
saint
patrick
i
never
saw
you
maybe
i
trespassing
now
you
are
agreed
burgeman
senior
in
a
colorless
voice
but
i
hardly
think
any
one
will
put
you
off
the
grounds
at
least
until
you
have
caught
your
breath
thank
you
maybe
the
grounds
are
yours
now
she
questioned
again
the
sick
man
signified
they
were
by
a
slight
nod
well
is
the
prettiest
place
hereabouts
patsy
offered
the
information
as
if
she
had
made
the
discovery
herself
and
was
generously
sharing
it
with
him
i
a
stranger
and
when
i
saw
yon
bit
of
cool
gray
water
and
the
pines
clustering
round
and
the
wee
green
faery
isle
in
the
midst
with
the
bridge
holding
onto
it
to
keep
it
from
disappearing
entirely
and
the
sand
so
white
and
the
lawns
so
green
why
it
looked
like
a
japanese
garden
set
in
a
great
sedge
bowl
do
you
wonder
i
had
to
come
closer
and
see
it
better
burgeman
said
nothing
but
the
ghost
of
a
feeling
showed
the
greed
of
possession
and
it
all
belongs
to
you
you
bought
it
all
the
lake
and
the
woods
and
the
lawns
it
was
not
a
question
but
a
statement
i
own
three
miles
in
every
direction
except
that
one
patsy
smiled
as
she
pointed
a
finger
upward
did
you
ever
think
how
generous
the
blessed
lord
is
to
lend
a
bit
of
his
sky
to
put
over
the
land
men
buy
and
fence
in
and
call
property
it
odd
how
a
body
can
think
he
owns
something
because
he
has
paid
money
for
it
and
yet
the
things
that
make
it
worth
the
owning
he
has
paid
for
at
all
what
do
you
mean
would
you
think
much
of
this
place
if
you
could
be
looking
yonder
and
watching
the
clouds
scud
by
all
turning
to
pink
and
flame
color
and
purple
as
the
sun
gathers
them
in
what
would
you
do
if
no
wild
flowers
grew
for
you
or
the
birds
forgot
you
in
the
spring
and
built
their
nests
and
sang
for
your
neighbor
instead
and
can
you
hire
the
sun
to
shine
by
the
day
or
order
the
rain
by
the
hogshead
burgeman
senior
was
contemplating
her
with
genuine
amazement
i
do
not
believe
i
have
ever
heard
any
one
put
forth
such
extraordinary
theories
before
may
i
ask
if
you
are
a
socialist
bless
you
no
i
am
a
very
ordinary
human
being
just
principally
human
do
you
know
who
i
am
for
an
instant
patsy
looked
at
him
without
speaking
then
she
answered
slowly
you
have
told
me
have
you
you
are
the
master
of
the
place
and
you
look
a
mortal
lonely
one
i
am
the
words
seemed
to
slip
from
his
lips
without
his
being
at
all
conscious
of
having
spoken
and
the
money
could
keep
it
from
you
there
was
no
mockery
in
her
tone
is
pitifully
few
comforts
you
can
buy
in
life
when
all
said
and
done
comforts
the
sick
man
eyes
grew
sharp
attacking
with
a
force
that
had
not
been
his
for
days
you
are
talking
now
like
a
fool
money
is
the
only
thing
that
can
buy
comforts
what
comforts
have
the
poor
are
you
meaning
butlers
and
limousines
electric
vibrators
and
those
are
only
cures
for
the
bodily
necessities
and
ills
that
money
brings
on
a
man
the
and
the
and
the
but
what
comforts
would
they
bring
to
a
troubled
mind
and
a
pinched
heart
tell
me
that
so
you
would
prefer
to
be
poor
more
pastorally
poetic
burgeman
sneered
more
comfortable
corrected
patsy
mind
you
i
not
meaning
starved
poverty
the
kind
that
breeds
anarchists
and
criminals
god
pity
them
too
i
mean
the
man
who
is
still
too
poor
to
reckon
his
worth
to
a
community
in
mere
money
who
instead
doles
kindness
and
service
to
his
neighbors
did
you
ever
see
a
man
richer
than
the
one
who
comes
home
at
day
end
after
eight
hours
of
good
clean
work
and
finds
the
wife
and
children
watching
for
him
and
laughing
the
sick
man
stirred
uneasily
well
ca
a
rich
man
find
the
same
happiness
aye
he
can
but
does
he
does
he
even
want
it
count
up
the
rich
men
you
know
and
how
many
are
there
like
that
no
answer
being
given
patsy
continued
take
the
richest
man
the
very
richest
man
in
all
this
country
do
you
suppose
in
all
his
life
he
ever
saw
his
own
lad
watching
for
him
to
come
home
what
do
you
know
about
the
richest
man
and
his
son
the
sick
man
had
for
a
moment
become
again
a
fiercely
bitter
fighting
force
a
power
given
to
sweeping
what
it
willed
before
it
he
sat
with
hands
clenched
his
eyes
burning
into
the
girl
on
the
ground
beside
him
i
know
what
the
world
says
the
world
lies
it
has
always
lied
you
are
wrong
it
is
a
tongue
here
and
a
tongue
there
that
bears
false
witness
but
the
world
passes
on
the
truth
it
has
to
you
forget
burgeman
senior
spoke
with
difficulty
it
is
the
rich
who
bear
the
burdens
of
the
world
cares
and
troubles
and
what
do
they
get
for
it
the
hatred
of
every
one
else
even
their
sons
every
one
hates
and
envies
the
man
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
the
more
he
has
the
more
he
is
feared
he
lives
friendless
he
dies
lonely
patsy
rose
to
her
knees
and
knelt
there
shaking
her
fist
a
composite
picture
of
supplicating
justice
and
accusing
truth
she
had
forgotten
that
the
man
before
her
was
sick
dying
that
he
must
have
suffered
terribly
in
spirit
as
well
as
body
and
that
her
words
were
so
many
barbed
shafts
striking
at
his
soul
she
remembered
nothing
save
the
thing
against
which
she
was
fighting
the
hard
merciless
possession
of
money
and
the
arrogant
boast
of
it
and
you
forget
that
the
burden
of
trouble
which
the
brave
rich
bear
so
nobly
are
troubles
they
put
into
the
world
themselves
they
hoard
their
money
to
buy
power
and
then
they
use
that
power
to
get
more
money
and
so
the
chain
grows
money
and
power
money
and
power
i
heard
of
a
rich
man
once
who
turned
a
terrible
fever
loose
all
over
the
land
because
he
bribed
the
health
inspectors
not
to
close
down
his
factories
and
after
death
had
swept
his
books
clean
he
gave
large
sums
of
money
to
stamp
out
the
epidemic
in
the
towns
faith
that
was
grand
the
bearing
of
that
trouble
and
why
are
the
rich
hated
why
do
they
live
friendless
and
die
lonely
not
because
they
hold
money
not
because
they
give
it
away
or
help
others
with
it
no
but
because
they
use
it
to
crush
others
to
rob
those
who
have
less
than
they
have
to
turn
their
power
into
a
curse
the
why
patsy
the
fanatic
turned
suddenly
into
patsy
the
human
again
the
fist
that
had
been
beating
the
air
under
his
nose
dropped
and
spread
itself
tenderly
on
the
sick
man
knee
but
i
sorry
you
lonely
if
there
was
anything
you
wanted
that
you
could
buy
and
i
could
earn
for
you
i
would
get
it
gladly
i
believe
you
would
and
the
confession
surprised
the
man
himself
more
than
it
did
patsy
who
are
you
he
asked
at
last
no
one
at
all
just
a
laggard
by
the
roadside
a
lass
with
no
home
no
kin
and
that
for
a
fortune
and
she
flung
out
her
two
empty
hands
palm
uppermost
and
laughed
and
you
are
audacious
enough
to
think
you
are
richer
than
i
this
time
there
was
no
sneer
in
his
voice
only
an
amused
toleration
i
am
said
patsy
simply
you
have
youth
and
health
he
conceded
grudgingly
aye
and
trust
in
other
folks
that
a
fearfully
rich
possession
it
is
i
might
exchange
with
you
all
this
and
his
hand
swept
encompassingly
over
his
great
estate
for
that
last
trust
in
other
folks
in
one
own
folks
maybe
i
give
it
to
you
for
nothing
a
little
of
it
at
any
rate
see
you
trust
me
and
here
trust
in
your
son
patsy
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
she
leaned
forward
and
opened
one
of
the
sick
man
hands
then
folded
the
fingers
tightly
over
something
that
appeared
to
be
invisible
and
precious
now
you
believe
in
him
no
matter
what
he
done
you
believe
he
would
wrong
you
or
himself
by
doing
anything
base
you
believe
that
he
is
coming
back
to
you
to
break
the
loneliness
and
that
he
find
a
poor
plain
man
for
a
father
waiting
him
do
you
remember
the
prodigal
lad
how
his
father
saw
him
a
long
way
off
and
went
to
meet
him
well
you
can
meet
him
with
a
trust
understanding
and
there
one
thing
more
do
you
be
so
blind
or
so
foolish
as
to
crush
him
with
the
weight
of
this
mind
he
has
the
right
to
the
making
of
his
own
life
for
a
bit
at
least
and
it
your
privilege
to
give
him
that
right
somehow
you
still
a
chance
to
keep
him
from
wanting
to
pitch
your
money
for
quoits
off
the
battery
patsy
sprang
to
her
feet
but
burgeman
senior
had
reached
forward
quickly
and
caught
her
skirt
holding
it
in
a
marvelously
firm
grip
then
you
do
know
who
i
am
you
known
it
all
along
i
know
you
the
master
of
all
this
and
your
lad
is
the
rich
son
that
all
and
you
think
you
think
i
have
no
right
to
leave
my
son
the
inheritance
i
have
worked
and
saved
for
him
i
think
you
have
no
right
to
leave
him
your
greed
is
a
mortal
poor
inheritance
for
any
lad
your
vocabulary
is
rather
blunt
burgeman
smiled
faintly
but
it
is
very
refreshing
it
is
a
long
time
since
naked
truth
and
i
met
face
to
face
but
will
it
do
you
any
good
or
is
it
too
late
patsy
eyed
him
contemplatively
too
late
for
what
too
late
for
the
inheritance
too
late
to
give
it
away
somewhere
else
or
loan
it
for
a
few
years
till
the
lad
had
a
chance
to
find
out
if
he
could
make
some
decent
use
of
it
himself
there
many
ways
of
doing
it
i
have
thought
of
a
few
this
last
you
might
loan
it
to
the
president
to
buy
up
some
of
the
railroads
for
the
government
or
to
purchase
the
coal
or
oil
supply
or
you
might
offer
it
as
a
prize
to
the
country
that
will
stop
fighting
first
or
it
might
buy
clean
politics
into
some
of
the
cities
or
endow
a
university
she
laughed
it
odd
is
it
how
a
body
without
a
cent
to
her
name
can
dispose
of
a
few
score
millions
in
less
minutes
if
you
please
sir
a
motionless
impersonal
figure
in
livery
stood
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
the
neither
of
them
had
been
conscious
of
his
presence
well
parsons
billy
sir
has
come
back
sir
he
and
fitzpatrick
came
together
shall
i
bring
them
out
here
or
wheel
you
inside
sir
inside
burgeman
senior
almost
shouted
it
then
he
turned
to
patsy
and
there
was
more
than
mere
curiosity
in
his
voice
who
are
you
no
one
at
all
just
a
laggard
by
the
roadside
she
repeated
wistfully
and
then
she
added
in
her
own
donegal
but
do
ye
let
the
lagging
count
for
naught
promise
me
that
the
sick
man
turned
his
head
for
a
last
look
at
her
such
a
simple
promise
to
throw
away
the
fruits
of
a
lifetime
bitterness
was
in
his
voice
again
but
patsy
caught
the
muttering
under
his
breath
i
might
think
about
the
boy
though
if
the
lord
granted
me
time
amen
whispered
patsy
she
scrambled
down
the
bank
the
way
she
had
come
for
a
moment
she
stopped
by
the
lake
and
skimmed
a
handful
of
white
pebbles
across
its
mirrored
surface
she
watched
the
ripples
she
had
made
spread
and
spread
until
they
lost
themselves
in
the
lake
itself
leaving
behind
no
mark
where
they
had
been
yonder
the
way
with
the
going
and
coming
of
most
of
us
a
little
ripple
and
naught
else
unless
it
is
one
more
stone
at
the
bottom
she
heaved
a
sigh
well
the
quest
is
over
and
i
never
laid
eyes
on
the
lad
once
but
it
ended
well
i
thinking
aye
it
ended
right
for
him
xv
arden
summer
must
have
made
one
day
in
june
purposely
as
a
setting
for
a
pastoral
comedy
and
chance
stole
it
like
a
kindly
knave
and
gave
it
to
the
sylvan
players
never
did
a
gathering
of
people
look
down
from
the
rise
of
a
natural
amphitheater
upon
a
fairer
scene
a
forest
of
arden
built
by
the
greatest
scenic
artist
since
the
world
began
birds
flew
about
the
trees
and
sang
whenever
the
orchestra
permitted
a
rabbit
or
two
scuttled
out
from
under
and
skipped
in
shy
ingénue
fashion
across
the
stage
while
overhead
a
blue
windless
sky
spread
radiance
about
players
and
audience
alike
shorn
of
so
much
of
the
theatricalism
of
ordinary
stage
performances
there
was
reality
and
charm
about
this
that
warmed
the
spectators
into
frequent
bursts
of
spontaneous
enthusiasm
which
were
as
draughts
of
elixir
to
the
players
those
who
were
playing
creditably
played
well
those
who
were
playing
well
excelled
themselves
and
patsy
outplayed
them
all
she
lived
every
minute
of
the
three
hours
that
spanned
the
throwing
of
charles
the
wrestler
and
her
promise
to
make
all
this
matter
even
there
was
no
touch
of
coarseness
in
her
rollicking
laughter
no
hoydenish
swagger
in
her
masquerading
it
was
all
subtly
irresistibly
feminine
and
george
travis
watching
from
the
obscurity
of
a
back
seat
pounded
his
knee
with
triumph
and
swore
he
would
make
her
the
greatest
shakespearean
actress
of
the
day
as
hymen
sang
her
parting
song
patsy
scanned
the
sea
of
faces
beyond
the
bank
of
juniper
which
served
instead
of
footlights
already
she
had
picked
out
travis
janet
payne
and
her
party
the
people
from
quality
house
who
still
gaped
at
her
unbelieving
and
young
looking
more
melancholy
myopic
and
poetical
than
before
but
the
one
face
she
hoped
to
find
was
missing
even
among
the
stragglers
at
the
back
and
it
took
all
her
to
keep
disappointment
and
an
odd
hurt
feeling
out
of
her
voice
as
she
gave
the
epilogue
on
the
way
to
her
tent
a
of
them
were
used
as
behind
the
stage
george
travis
overtook
her
all
right
girl
you
made
a
bigger
hit
than
even
i
expected
going
to
try
you
out
in
patsy
cut
him
short
you
sat
at
the
back
did
you
see
a
vagabond
lad
hanging
around
anywhere
with
a
limp
to
him
the
manager
looked
at
her
with
amused
toleration
does
a
mere
man
happen
to
be
of
more
consequence
this
minute
than
your
success
oh
i
say
that
not
like
you
irish
patsy
she
crimsoned
and
the
manager
teased
no
more
we
play
greyfriars
and
back
to
brambleside
the
day
after
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
you
out
there
in
juliet
if
you
can
handle
tragedy
as
you
can
comedy
i
star
you
next
winter
on
broadway
oh
your
very
nearly
made
you
lucky
girl
but
patsy
slipping
into
her
tent
hardly
heard
the
last
if
they
played
greyfriars
the
next
day
that
meant
they
would
leave
arden
on
the
first
train
after
they
were
packed
and
that
meant
she
was
passing
once
and
for
all
beyond
tramping
reach
of
the
tinker
there
was
a
dull
ache
at
her
heart
which
she
attempted
neither
to
explain
nor
to
analyze
it
was
there
that
was
enough
with
impatient
fingers
she
tore
off
rosalind
wedding
finery
and
attacked
her
then
she
lingered
over
her
dressing
hoping
to
avoid
the
rest
of
the
company
and
any
congratulatory
friends
who
might
happen
to
be
browsing
around
she
wanted
to
be
alone
with
her
memories
to
have
and
to
hold
them
a
little
longer
before
they
should
grow
too
dim
and
far
away
a
hand
scratched
at
the
flap
of
her
tent
and
janet
payne
voice
broke
into
her
reverie
ca
we
see
you
please
for
just
a
moment
we
solemnly
promise
not
to
stay
long
patsy
hooked
back
the
flap
and
forced
the
semblance
of
a
welcome
into
her
greeting
it
was
simply
ripping
chorused
the
dempsy
carters
each
gripping
a
hand
janet
payne
looked
down
upon
her
with
adoring
eyes
it
was
the
best
the
very
best
i
ever
seen
you
or
any
one
else
play
it
for
the
first
time
rosalind
seemed
a
real
girl
but
it
was
the
voice
of
gregory
jessup
that
carried
above
the
others
have
you
heard
miss
burgeman
died
last
night
and
billy
was
with
him
he
come
home
faith
then
there
some
virtue
in
signs
after
all
a
hush
fell
on
the
group
patsy
suddenly
put
out
her
hand
i
glad
for
you
i
glad
for
him
and
i
hope
it
ended
right
did
you
see
him
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
time
to
say
much
but
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
won
out
he
said
he
and
the
old
man
had
had
a
good
talk
together
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
said
it
had
given
him
a
father
whose
memory
could
never
shame
him
or
make
him
bitter
i
wanted
to
tell
you
so
you
would
have
him
on
your
mind
any
longer
she
smiled
retrospectively
thank
you
but
i
heaved
him
off
nearly
hours
ago
left
to
herself
again
she
finished
her
packing
then
tying
under
her
chin
a
silly
little
of
white
chiffon
and
still
somewhat
crushed
from
its
long
imprisonment
in
a
trunk
she
went
back
for
a
last
glimpse
of
the
forest
and
her
greenwood
tree
the
place
was
deserted
except
for
the
teamsters
who
had
come
for
the
tents
and
the
property
trunks
a
flash
of
white
against
the
green
of
the
tree
caught
her
eye
for
an
instant
she
thought
it
one
of
orlando
poetic
effusions
overlooked
in
the
play
and
since
forgotten
idly
curious
she
pulled
it
down
and
read
it
once
twice
three
times
where
twin
oaks
rustle
in
the
wind
there
waits
a
lad
for
rosalind
if
still
she
be
so
kind
perchance
she
ease
the
fretted
mind
that
naught
can
cure
but
rosalind
with
a
glad
little
cry
she
crumpled
the
paper
in
her
hand
and
fled
straight
as
a
throstle
to
its
mate
to
the
giant
twin
oaks
which
were
landmarks
in
the
forest
her
eyes
were
for
a
vagabond
figure
in
rags
it
was
small
wonder
therefore
that
they
refused
to
acknowledge
the
man
in
his
suit
of
gray
who
was
leaning
partly
against
the
hole
of
a
tree
and
partly
on
a
pilgrim
staff
she
stood
and
stared
and
gave
no
sign
of
greeting
well
so
the
duke
daughter
found
her
rhyme
i
not
knowing
whether
i
own
ye
or
not
sure
ye
no
longer
the
look
of
an
honest
tinker
and
maybe
we
best
part
company
now
before
we
meet
at
all
but
the
tinker
had
her
firmly
by
both
hands
that
too
late
now
i
would
have
come
in
rags
if
there
been
anything
left
of
them
but
they
are
the
only
things
i
intend
to
part
company
with
and
do
you
know
he
gripped
her
hands
tighter
i
met
an
acquaintance
as
i
came
this
way
who
told
me
with
eyes
nearly
popping
out
of
his
head
that
the
wonderful
little
person
who
had
played
herself
straight
into
hundreds
of
hearts
had
actually
been
his
cook
for
three
days
oh
lass
lass
how
could
you
do
it
troth
god
made
me
a
better
cook
than
actress
ye
would
want
me
to
be
slighting
his
handiwork
entirely
would
ye
the
tinker
shook
his
head
at
her
do
you
know
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
every
one
of
those
people
who
had
been
watching
you
i
wanted
to
say
think
she
is
a
wonderful
actress
she
is
more
than
that
she
is
a
rare
sweet
true
woman
better
and
finer
than
any
play
she
may
act
in
or
any
part
she
may
play
in
it
i
the
tinker
have
discovered
this
and
i
know
her
better
than
does
any
one
else
in
the
whole
world
is
that
so
a
teasing
touch
of
irony
crept
into
patsy
voice
is
a
pity
now
the
manager
could
be
hearing
ye
he
might
give
ye
a
chance
to
understudy
orlando
and
you
think
i
be
content
to
understudy
any
one
why
i
going
to
pitch
orlando
straight
out
of
the
forest
of
arden
i
going
to
pull
willie
shakespeare
out
of
his
grave
and
make
him
rewrite
the
whole
play
putting
a
tinker
in
the
leading
role
and
is
it
a
tragedy
ye
would
have
him
make
it
would
it
be
a
tragedy
to
take
a
tinker
better
for
worse
faith
that
would
depend
on
the
tinker
so
it
up
to
the
tinker
is
it
well
the
tinker
will
prove
it
otherwise
he
will
guarantee
to
keep
the
play
running
pure
comedy
to
the
end
so
that
settles
it
miss
patricia
alias
rosalind
alias
the
cook
alias
patsy
the
best
little
comrade
a
lonely
man
ever
found
i
am
going
to
marry
you
the
day
after
right
here
in
arden
patsy
looked
at
him
long
and
thoughtfully
from
under
the
beguiling
shadow
of
the
white
chiffon
sunbonnet
is
a
shame
just
to
discourage
anything
so
brave
as
a
tinker
but
i
not
be
here
the
day
after
and
what
more
a
man
is
a
fool
to
marry
any
woman
because
he
lonely
and
she
can
cook
the
tinker
eyes
twinkled
i
do
know
a
man
might
marry
for
worse
reasons
then
he
grew
suddenly
sober
and
his
eyes
looked
deep
into
hers
but
you
know
and
i
know
that
that
is
not
my
reason
for
wanting
you
or
yours
for
taking
me
i
did
say
i
would
take
ye
this
time
it
was
patsy
eyes
that
twinkled
do
ye
think
it
would
be
so
easy
to
give
up
my
career
the
big
success
i
hoped
and
worked
and
waited
for
just
just
for
a
tinker
i
be
a
fool
to
think
of
it
she
was
smiling
inwardly
at
her
own
power
of
speech
which
made
what
she
held
as
naught
sound
of
such
immeasurable
consequence
but
the
tinker
smiled
outwardly
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
be
the
day
after
that
another
thing
i
did
not
say
if
ye
are
going
to
marry
me
is
your
business
to
find
me
she
freed
her
hands
and
started
off
without
a
backward
glance
at
him
patsy
patsy
he
called
after
her
would
you
like
to
know
the
name
of
the
man
you
going
to
marry
she
turned
and
faced
him
framed
in
the
soft
green
fringe
of
the
trees
she
seemed
to
him
the
very
embodiment
of
young
summer
the
free
untrammeled
spirit
of
arden
ever
since
the
first
he
had
been
growing
more
and
more
conscious
of
what
she
was
a
nature
vital
beautiful
tender
untouched
by
the
searing
things
of
life
trusting
and
worthy
of
trust
but
it
was
not
until
this
moment
that
he
realized
the
future
promise
of
her
and
the
realization
swept
all
his
smoldering
love
aflame
into
his
eyes
and
lips
his
arms
went
out
to
her
in
a
sudden
passionate
appeal
patsy
patsy
would
the
name
make
any
difference
why
should
it
she
cried
with
saucy
coquetry
i
marrying
the
man
and
not
his
name
if
i
can
stand
the
one
i
can
put
up
with
the
other
i
thinking
anyhow
be
on
the
marriage
license
the
day
after
and
that
time
enough
do
you
really
mean
you
would
marry
a
man
not
knowing
his
name
or
anything
about
his
family
or
his
income
or
that
the
civilized
way
is
it
to
find
out
about
those
things
first
and
afterward
it
time
enough
when
you
married
to
get
acquainted
with
your
man
but
that
not
the
way
that
leads
off
the
road
to
arden
and
it
not
my
way
i
know
my
man
now
god
bless
him
and
away
she
ran
through
the
trees
and
out
of
sight
the
tinker
watched
the
trees
and
underbrush
swing
into
place
covering
her
exit
so
tense
and
motionless
he
stood
one
might
have
suspected
him
of
trying
to
conjure
her
back
again
by
the
simple
magic
of
heart
and
will
it
turned
out
a
disappointing
piece
of
conjuring
however
the
green
parted
again
but
not
to
redisclose
patsy
a
man
instead
walked
into
the
open
toward
the
giant
oaks
and
one
glimpse
of
him
swept
the
tinker
memory
back
to
a
certain
afternoon
and
a
he
could
see
himself
sitting
propped
up
by
the
watching
the
door
of
a
little
white
church
while
down
the
road
clattered
a
sorrel
mare
and
a
runabout
and
the
man
that
drove
the
man
who
was
trailing
patsy
was
the
man
that
came
toward
him
now
looking
for
some
one
you
have
seen
he
began
but
the
tinker
interrupted
him
guess
not
i
been
watching
the
company
break
up
rather
interesting
to
any
one
not
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
think
the
man
eyed
him
narrowly
then
cautiously
he
dropped
into
an
attitude
of
exaggerated
indifference
it
sure
is
young
feller
now
you
hai
been
watchin
that
there
leadin
lady
more
particularly
have
you
i
sort
o
she
might
have
a
takin
way
with
the
fellers
and
he
prodded
the
tinker
with
a
jocular
thumb
the
tinker
responded
promptly
with
a
foolish
grin
maybe
i
have
but
the
luck
was
dead
against
me
guess
she
had
a
lot
of
friends
with
her
i
saw
them
carry
her
off
in
triumph
in
a
big
probably
they
dine
her
at
the
country
club
the
man
did
not
wait
for
further
exchange
of
pleasantries
he
took
the
direction
the
tinker
indicated
and
the
tinker
watched
him
go
with
a
suppressed
chuckle
history
positively
stutters
sometimes
now
if
that
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
the
company
will
be
safe
out
of
arden
before
a
runabout
could
make
the
country
club
and
back
but
the
tinker
mirth
was
of
short
duration
with
a
shout
of
derision
he
slapped
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
viciously
what
a
confounded
fool
i
am
why
in
the
name
of
reason
did
i
give
them
to
him
and
stop
this
sleuth
business
before
it
really
gets
her
into
trouble
of
all
the
idiotic
senseless
and
leaning
on
the
pilgrim
staff
he
slowly
hobbled
in
the
same
direction
he
had
given
the
man
one
last
piece
of
news
concerning
billy
burgeman
came
to
patsy
before
she
left
arden
that
afternoon
gregory
jessup
was
at
the
station
to
see
her
off
and
he
took
her
aside
for
the
few
minutes
before
the
train
arrived
i
tried
to
get
billy
to
join
me
knew
it
would
do
him
good
to
meet
you
but
he
would
budge
i
rather
think
he
still
a
trifle
sore
on
girls
nothing
personal
you
understand
patsy
certainly
did
far
better
than
his
friend
knew
in
her
heart
she
was
trying
her
best
to
be
interested
and
grateful
to
the
rich
man
son
for
his
unconscious
part
in
her
happiness
had
it
not
been
for
him
there
would
have
been
no
quest
no
road
and
without
the
road
there
would
have
been
no
tinker
and
without
the
tinker
no
happiness
it
was
none
the
less
hard
to
be
interested
however
now
that
her
mind
had
given
over
the
lonely
occupation
of
contemplating
memories
for
that
most
magical
of
all
mental
crafts
she
jerked
up
her
attention
sharply
as
gregory
jessup
began
speaking
again
billy
told
me
just
before
i
came
down
why
he
had
gone
away
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
the
old
man
reputation
but
he
was
credited
with
being
the
hardest
master
with
his
men
that
you
could
find
either
side
of
the
water
in
the
beginning
he
made
his
money
by
screwing
down
the
wages
and
unscrewing
the
labor
and
no
sentiment
that
was
his
slogan
whether
he
kept
it
up
from
habit
or
pure
cussedness
i
ca
tell
but
that
the
real
reason
billy
would
never
go
into
his
father
business
he
stand
his
meanness
the
old
man
secretary
forged
a
check
for
ten
thousand
billy
caught
him
and
cashed
it
himself
to
save
the
man
he
shouldered
the
guilt
so
his
father
would
suspect
the
man
and
hound
him
i
know
said
patsy
forgetting
that
she
was
supposed
to
know
nothing
but
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
did
the
secretary
want
to
forge
a
check
why
does
any
one
forge
he
needs
money
when
billy
caught
him
the
old
fellow
went
all
to
pieces
and
told
a
pretty
tough
story
you
see
he
been
burgeman
secretary
for
almost
twenty
years
given
him
the
best
years
of
his
life
slaved
for
him
lied
for
him
made
money
for
him
billy
said
his
father
regarded
him
as
an
excellent
piece
of
office
machinery
and
treated
him
as
if
he
were
nothing
more
the
poor
chap
had
always
had
hard
luck
a
delicate
wife
three
or
four
children
who
were
eternally
having
or
needing
something
and
poor
relations
demanding
help
he
could
refuse
between
doctors
bills
and
clothing
and
the
relatives
he
had
no
chance
to
save
at
last
he
broke
down
and
the
doctor
told
him
it
was
an
outdoor
life
with
absolute
freedom
from
the
strain
of
serving
a
man
like
burgeman
or
the
undertaker
for
him
so
he
went
to
burgeman
asked
him
to
loan
him
the
money
to
invest
in
a
and
let
him
pay
it
off
as
fast
as
he
could
well
patsy
was
interested
at
last
well
the
old
man
turned
him
down
shouted
his
sentiment
slogan
at
him
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
what
the
doctor
said
he
told
him
flat
that
a
man
who
had
saved
a
cent
in
twenty
years
could
in
twenty
years
more
and
he
only
put
money
into
investments
that
paid
the
poor
chap
went
away
frantic
worked
himself
into
thinking
he
was
entitled
to
that
last
chance
and
when
billy
heard
the
story
he
thought
so
too
in
the
end
billy
cashed
the
check
gave
the
secretary
the
money
and
they
both
cleared
out
he
knew
if
his
father
ever
suspected
the
truth
he
would
have
the
poor
chap
followed
and
dragged
back
to
pay
the
full
penalty
of
the
law
he
and
all
his
family
with
him
patsy
smiled
whimsically
it
sounds
so
simple
and
believable
when
you
have
it
explained
but
it
would
have
been
rather
nice
now
if
billy
burgeman
could
have
known
that
one
person
believed
in
him
from
the
beginning
without
an
explanation
who
did
faith
how
should
i
know
i
was
supposing
just
but
as
patsy
climbed
onto
the
train
she
muttered
under
her
breath
we
come
out
even
i
thinking
if
he
missed
knowing
that
missed
knowing
a
fine
lad
xvi
the
road
begins
all
over
again
on
the
second
day
following
patsy
played
juliet
at
brambleside
and
more
than
satisfied
george
travis
while
his
mind
was
racing
ahead
planning
her
particular
stardom
on
broadway
and
her
mind
was
pestering
her
with
its
fears
and
uncertainties
into
a
state
of
private
prostration
the
manager
of
the
brambleside
inn
was
telephoning
the
green
county
sheriff
to
come
at
once
he
had
found
the
girl
so
it
came
about
at
the
final
dropping
of
the
curtain
as
patsy
was
climbing
down
from
her
bier
that
four
eagerly
determined
men
confronted
her
each
plainly
wishful
to
be
the
first
to
gain
her
attention
well
said
the
tinker
pointedly
are
you
ready
it
all
settled
travis
was
jubilant
you
play
broadway
for
six
months
next
winter
or
i
no
manager
it
was
the
manager
of
the
brambleside
inn
and
the
green
county
sheriff
however
who
gave
the
greatest
dramatic
effect
they
placed
themselves
adroitly
on
either
side
of
patsy
and
announced
together
you
under
arrest
holy
saint
patrick
patsy
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
amused
or
angry
with
the
actual
coming
of
the
tinker
and
the
laying
of
her
fears
her
mind
seemed
strangely
limp
and
inadequate
her
lips
quivered
even
as
they
smiled
maybe
i
had
best
go
back
to
my
bier
you
could
arrest
a
dead
capulet
but
george
travis
swept
her
aside
he
saw
nothing
amusing
in
the
situation
what
do
you
mean
by
insulting
miss
and
myself
by
such
a
performance
why
should
she
be
under
arrest
for
being
one
of
the
best
shakespearean
actresses
we
had
in
this
country
for
many
a
long
barren
year
no
for
stealing
two
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
from
a
guest
in
this
hotel
the
night
she
palmed
herself
off
as
miss
st
regis
the
manager
of
the
inn
bit
off
his
words
as
if
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
their
flavor
but
she
never
was
here
shouted
travis
yes
i
was
contradicted
patsy
and
she
sneaked
off
in
the
morning
with
the
jewels
growled
the
manager
and
i
trailed
over
the
country
for
four
days
trying
to
find
the
girl
in
a
brown
suit
that
he
described
said
she
was
on
her
way
to
arden
i
give
a
doggoned
big
cigar
to
know
where
you
was
all
that
time
and
there
was
something
akin
to
admiration
in
the
expression
but
patsy
did
not
see
she
was
looking
hard
at
the
tinker
with
an
odd
little
smile
pulling
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
the
tinker
smiled
back
while
he
reached
deep
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
brought
out
a
small
package
which
he
presented
to
the
sheriff
are
those
what
you
are
looking
for
they
were
five
unset
diamonds
well
i
be
hanged
did
she
give
them
to
you
the
manager
of
the
inn
looked
suspiciously
from
the
tinker
to
patsy
no
she
did
know
i
had
them
did
even
know
they
existed
and
that
she
was
being
trailed
as
a
suspected
thief
why
what
the
matter
for
patsy
had
suddenly
grown
white
and
her
lips
were
trembling
past
control
naught
naught
they
could
understand
but
i
finding
out
there
was
more
than
one
quest
on
the
road
to
arden
more
than
one
soul
who
fared
forth
to
help
another
in
trouble
and
my
heart
is
breaking
just
with
the
memory
of
it
and
patsy
sank
back
on
the
bier
and
covered
her
face
what
is
it
dear
whispered
a
distressed
tinker
do
ask
now
here
sometime
i
be
telling
ye
well
the
sheriff
thumbed
the
armholes
of
his
vest
in
a
manner
i
we
waited
about
long
enough
young
man
supposin
you
explain
how
you
come
to
have
those
stones
in
your
possession
and
why
you
lied
to
me
about
her
and
sent
me
hiking
off
to
that
country
club
when
you
knew
durned
well
where
she
was
the
tinker
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
certainly
it
very
simple
i
found
these
in
a
suit
of
rags
which
i
saw
on
a
tramp
the
morning
you
lost
the
diamonds
and
miss
i
liked
the
rags
so
well
that
i
paid
the
tramp
to
change
clothes
with
me
he
took
mine
and
gave
me
his
along
with
a
knockout
blow
for
good
measure
the
manager
of
the
inn
interrupted
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
so
you
were
the
young
fellow
they
picked
up
senseless
by
the
stables
that
morning
when
the
grooms
saw
the
other
man
running
they
made
out
it
was
you
who
had
struck
him
first
wish
i
had
but
i
squared
it
off
with
him
a
few
days
later
the
tinker
chuckled
at
the
time
i
could
make
out
why
he
struck
me
except
to
get
the
rest
of
the
money
i
had
but
of
course
he
wanted
to
get
the
stones
he
sewed
up
in
these
rags
and
forgotten
i
began
to
suspect
something
when
i
found
you
trailing
miss
see
here
young
man
and
was
you
the
feller
that
put
me
on
the
wrong
road
twice
the
sheriff
laid
a
hand
of
the
law
suggestively
against
his
chest
the
tinker
chuckled
again
i
certainly
was
it
would
have
been
pretty
discouraging
for
miss
if
you
found
her
before
we
had
the
defense
ready
and
it
would
have
been
awkward
for
you
to
have
to
take
a
lady
in
custody
i
that
about
right
and
the
sheriff
relaxed
into
a
grin
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
manager
of
the
inn
and
pounded
his
palm
with
his
fist
by
jupiter
i
betcher
that
there
tramp
is
the
feller
that
been
cleanin
up
these
parts
for
the
past
two
years
hangs
round
as
a
tramp
at
back
doors
and
stables
and
picks
up
what
information
he
needs
to
break
into
the
house
easy
never
hitched
him
up
in
my
mind
to
the
thefts
afore
but
i
it
the
one
man
and
he
it
guess
you
right
the
tinker
agreed
last
saturday
when
i
came
upon
him
again
in
an
automobile
still
in
my
clothes
we
had
a
final
fight
for
the
possession
of
the
rags
which
i
still
wore
and
the
but
he
never
finished
patsy
had
sprung
to
her
feet
and
was
looking
at
him
bewilderment
accusation
almost
fright
showing
through
her
tears
your
clothes
your
clothes
you
wore
a
then
you
are
hush
said
the
tinker
he
turned
to
the
others
i
think
that
is
all
gentlemen
i
searched
the
rags
after
i
had
finished
my
score
with
the
thief
and
found
the
stones
i
brought
them
over
this
afternoon
to
return
to
their
rightful
owner
i
might
have
returned
them
that
day
after
the
play
but
i
forgot
until
the
sheriff
had
gone
you
are
entirely
welcome
good
afternoon
he
dismissed
them
promptly
but
courteously
as
if
the
stage
had
been
his
own
and
the
two
had
suddenly
expressed
a
desire
to
take
their
leave
at
the
wings
he
left
them
and
came
back
direct
to
george
travis
there
is
more
thieving
to
be
done
this
afternoon
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
i
am
going
to
steal
your
future
star
right
from
under
your
nose
and
i
shall
never
return
her
what
do
you
mean
travis
stared
at
him
blankly
just
what
i
say
miss
and
i
are
to
be
married
this
afternoon
in
arden
that
simply
out
of
the
patsy
who
had
found
her
tongue
at
last
laid
a
coaxing
hand
on
travis
arm
no
it
is
i
wired
miriam
yesterday
to
see
if
she
was
really
as
sick
as
you
thought
she
was
sick
but
she
ever
so
much
better
and
her
nerves
are
not
going
to
be
nearly
as
troublesome
as
she
feared
she
quite
willing
to
come
back
and
take
her
old
place
and
she
be
well
enough
next
week
patsy
voice
had
become
vibrant
with
feeling
now
do
ye
be
and
think
ungrateful
we
all
been
playing
in
a
bigger
comedy
than
willie
shakespeare
ever
wrote
and
sure
we
got
to
be
playing
it
out
to
the
end
as
it
was
meant
to
be
and
you
mean
to
give
up
your
career
your
big
chance
of
success
travis
still
looked
incredulous
do
you
realize
you
be
famous
famous
and
rich
he
emphasized
the
last
word
unduly
it
set
patsy
eyes
to
blazing
aye
i
no
longer
be
like
granny
donoghue
lean
pig
hungry
for
scrapings
well
i
rather
be
hungry
for
scrapings
than
starving
for
love
i
knew
one
woman
who
threw
away
love
to
be
famous
and
rich
and
i
watched
her
die
thank
god
kept
my
feet
from
that
road
sure
i
would
be
rich
she
choked
suddenly
and
looked
helplessly
at
the
tinker
neither
would
i
and
he
spoke
with
a
solemn
conviction
in
the
end
travis
gave
in
he
took
his
disappointment
and
his
loss
like
the
true
gentleman
he
was
and
sent
them
away
with
his
blessing
mixed
with
an
honest
twinge
of
it
was
not
however
until
patsy
turned
to
wave
him
a
last
farewell
and
smile
a
last
grateful
smile
from
under
the
white
chiffon
sunbonnet
that
he
remembered
that
convention
had
been
slighted
wait
a
minute
he
said
running
after
them
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
future
husband
perhaps
you
introduce
us
for
once
in
her
life
patsy
looked
fairly
aghast
and
travis
repeated
patiently
his
name
irish
patsy
i
want
to
know
his
name
the
tinker
might
have
helped
her
out
but
he
chose
otherwise
he
kept
silent
his
eyes
on
patsy
as
if
he
would
read
her
answer
there
before
she
spoke
it
to
travis
well
she
said
at
last
slowly
maybe
i
not
sure
of
it
myself
except
i
knowing
it
must
be
a
good
tinker
name
and
then
laughter
danced
all
over
her
face
i
tell
ye
ye
can
be
reading
it
in
the
papers
whereupon
she
slipped
her
arm
through
the
tinker
and
he
led
her
away
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
once
more
patsy
and
the
tinker
found
themselves
tramping
the
road
to
arden
only
this
time
it
was
down
the
straight
road
marked
seven
miles
and
it
was
early
evening
instead
of
morning
do
ye
think
we
reach
it
now
inquired
patsy
we
have
reached
it
already
we
just
going
back
and
what
happened
to
the
brown
dress
i
burned
it
that
night
in
the
cottage
to
fool
the
sheriff
and
i
thought
that
night
it
was
me
ye
had
tricked
just
for
the
whim
of
it
did
ye
know
who
i
was
by
chance
of
course
i
knew
i
had
seen
you
with
the
irish
players
many
many
times
and
i
knew
you
the
very
moment
your
voice
came
over
the
road
to
me
wishing
me
brave
day
the
tinker
eyes
deepened
with
tenderness
do
you
think
for
a
moment
if
i
had
known
something
about
you
and
was
hungering
to
know
more
that
i
would
have
schemed
and
cheated
to
keep
your
comradeship
ye
might
tell
me
then
how
ye
came
to
know
about
the
cottage
and
how
your
picture
ever
climbed
to
the
you
know
i
meant
to
burn
that
along
with
the
dress
and
i
forgot
what
did
you
think
when
you
discovered
it
faith
i
thought
it
was
the
picture
of
the
truest
gentleman
god
had
ever
made
and
i
fetched
it
along
with
me
for
company
the
tinker
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
as
of
old
what
will
poor
old
greg
say
when
he
finds
it
gone
oh
i
know
how
you
almost
stole
his
faithful
old
heart
by
being
so
pitying
of
his
friend
and
how
you
made
the
sign
for
him
to
follow
aye
agreed
patsy
but
what
of
the
cottage
that
belongs
to
greg
father
he
and
the
girls
are
west
this
summer
so
the
cottage
was
closed
and
the
breakfast
with
the
throstles
and
the
the
tinker
laid
his
finger
over
her
lips
please
sweetheart
try
to
steal
away
all
the
magic
and
the
poetry
from
our
road
you
will
leave
it
very
barren
if
you
do
thinking
silence
held
their
tongues
until
curiosity
again
loosened
patsy
and
what
started
ye
on
the
road
in
rags
ye
have
never
really
answered
that
i
have
never
honestly
wanted
to
it
is
not
a
pleasant
answer
he
drew
patsy
closer
and
his
hands
closed
over
hers
promise
you
will
never
think
of
it
again
that
you
and
i
will
forget
that
part
of
the
road
after
patsy
nodded
i
borrowed
the
rags
so
that
it
would
take
a
pretty
smart
coroner
to
identify
the
person
in
it
after
the
train
had
passed
under
the
from
which
he
fell
by
accident
do
shudder
dear
was
it
so
terrible
that
wish
to
get
away
from
a
world
that
held
nothing
not
even
some
one
to
grieve
remember
when
i
started
there
was
a
soul
who
believed
in
me
who
would
care
much
one
way
or
another
unless
perhaps
poor
old
greg
would
ye
mind
letting
me
look
at
the
marriage
license
i
like
to
be
seeing
it
written
down
the
tinker
produced
it
and
she
read
william
burgeman
then
she
added
with
a
stubborn
shake
of
the
head
mind
though
i
not
be
rich
you
will
not
have
to
be
father
has
left
me
absolutely
nothing
for
ten
years
after
that
i
can
inherit
his
money
or
not
as
we
choose
it
a
glorious
arrangement
the
money
is
all
disposed
of
to
good
civic
purpose
if
we
refuse
i
am
very
glad
it
settled
that
way
for
i
afraid
i
would
never
have
had
the
heart
to
come
to
you
dear
dragging
all
those
millions
after
me
then
it
is
a
free
open
road
for
the
both
of
us
and
please
heaven
we
never
misuse
it
she
laughed
joyously
some
day
she
would
tell
him
of
her
meeting
with
his
father
life
was
too
full
now
for
that
the
tinker
fell
into
his
old
swinging
stride
that
patsy
had
found
so
hard
to
keep
pace
with
and
silence
again
held
their
tongues
do
you
think
we
shall
find
the
castle
with
a
window
for
every
day
in
the
year
the
tinker
asked
at
last
aye
why
not
and
we
be
as
happy
as
i
can
tell
ye
and
twice
as
happy
as
ye
can
tell
me
does
every
lad
and
lass
find
it
anew
for
themselves
when
they
take
to
the
long
road
with
naught
but
love
and
trust
in
their
hearts
and
their
hands
together
they
may
find
it
when
they
young
they
may
not
find
it
till
they
old
but
it
will
be
there
ever
beckoning
them
on
with
the
purple
hills
rising
toward
it
and
there
a
miracle
in
the
castle
that
i
never
told
ye
no
matter
how
old
and
how
worn
and
how
stooped
the
lad
and
his
lass
may
have
grown
there
he
sees
her
only
fresh
and
fair
and
she
sees
him
only
brave
and
straight
and
strong
she
stopped
and
faced
him
her
hands
slipping
out
of
his
and
creeping
up
to
his
shoulders
and
about
his
neck
dear
lad
promise
me
one
thing
promise
me
we
shall
never
forget
the
road
no
matter
how
snugly
we
may
be
housed
or
how
close
comfort
and
happiness
sit
at
our
hearthside
we
be
faring
forth
just
once
in
so
often
to
touch
earth
again
and
we
help
to
keep
faith
in
human
nature
aye
and
kindness
alive
in
the
world
and
we
make
our
friends
by
reason
of
that
and
not
because
of
the
gold
we
may
or
may
not
be
having
and
do
you
still
think
kindness
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
no
there
is
one
thing
better
but
kindness
tramps
mortal
close
at
its
heels
patsy
hands
slipped
from
his
shoulders
she
clasped
them
together
in
sudden
intensity
have
ye
any
curiosity
at
all
to
know
what
fetched
me
after
ye
yes
but
there
is
and
all
the
days
after
to
tell
me
no
there
is
just
the
telling
of
it
is
the
only
i
have
for
ye
dear
lad
i
was
with
marjorie
schuyler
in
the
den
that
day
you
came
to
her
and
told
her
you
heard
everything
aye
and
you
came
believing
in
me
after
all
i
came
to
show
you
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
who
trusted
you
who
would
trust
you
across
the
world
and
back
again
that
all
the
i
have
for
ye
dear
barring
love
and
then
and
there
in
the
open
road
still
a
good
three
miles
from
the
arden
church
the
tinker
gathered
her
close
