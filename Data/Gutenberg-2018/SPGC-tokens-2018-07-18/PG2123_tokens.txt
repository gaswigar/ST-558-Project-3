the
crime
of
sylvestre
bonnard
by
anatole
france
part
i
the
log
december
i
had
put
on
my
slippers
and
my
i
wiped
away
a
tear
with
which
the
north
wind
blowing
over
the
quay
had
obscured
my
vision
a
bright
fire
was
leaping
in
the
chimney
of
my
study
shaped
like
were
sprouting
over
the
windowpanes
and
concealed
from
me
the
seine
with
its
bridges
and
the
louvre
of
the
valois
i
drew
up
my
to
the
hearth
and
my
and
took
up
so
much
of
my
place
by
the
fire
as
hamilcar
deigned
to
allow
me
hamilcar
was
lying
in
front
of
the
andirons
curled
up
on
a
cushion
with
his
nose
between
his
paws
his
think
find
fur
rose
and
fell
with
his
regular
breathing
at
my
coming
he
slowly
slipped
a
glance
of
his
agate
eyes
at
me
from
between
his
lids
which
he
closed
again
almost
at
once
thinking
to
himself
it
is
nothing
it
is
only
my
hamilcar
i
said
to
him
as
i
stretched
my
legs
hamilcar
somnolent
prince
of
the
city
of
books
thou
guardian
nocturnal
like
that
divine
cat
who
combated
the
impious
in
heliopolis
in
the
night
of
the
great
combat
thou
dost
defend
from
vile
nibblers
those
books
which
the
old
savant
acquired
at
the
cost
of
his
slender
savings
and
indefatigable
zeal
sleep
hamilcar
softly
as
a
sultana
in
this
library
that
shelters
thy
military
virtues
for
verily
in
thy
person
are
united
the
formidable
aspect
of
a
tatar
warrior
and
the
slumbrous
grace
of
a
woman
of
the
orient
sleep
thou
heroic
and
voluptuous
hamilcar
while
awaiting
the
moonlight
hour
in
which
the
mice
will
come
forth
to
dance
before
the
acta
sanctorum
of
the
learned
bolandists
the
beginning
of
this
discourse
pleased
hamilcar
who
accompanied
it
with
a
like
the
song
of
a
kettle
on
the
fire
but
as
my
voice
waxed
louder
hamilcar
notified
me
by
lowering
his
ears
and
by
wrinkling
the
striped
skin
of
his
brow
that
it
was
bad
taste
on
my
part
so
to
declaim
this
man
evidently
thought
hamilcar
talks
to
no
purpose
at
all
while
our
housekeeper
never
utters
a
word
which
is
not
full
of
good
sense
full
of
significance
containing
either
the
announcement
of
a
meal
or
the
promise
of
a
whipping
one
knows
what
she
says
but
this
old
man
puts
together
a
lot
of
sounds
signifying
so
thought
hamilcar
to
himself
leaving
him
to
his
reflections
i
opened
a
book
which
i
began
to
read
with
interest
for
it
was
a
catalogue
of
manuscripts
i
do
not
know
any
reading
more
easy
more
fascinating
more
delightful
than
that
of
a
catalogue
the
one
which
i
was
reading
edited
in
by
thompson
librarian
to
sir
thomas
raleigh
sins
it
is
true
by
excess
of
brevity
and
does
not
offer
that
character
of
exactitude
which
the
archivists
of
my
own
generation
were
the
first
to
introduce
into
works
upon
diplomatics
and
paleography
it
leaves
a
good
deal
to
be
desired
and
to
be
divined
this
is
perhaps
why
i
find
myself
aware
while
reading
it
of
a
state
of
mind
which
in
nature
more
imaginative
than
mine
might
be
called
reverie
i
had
allowed
myself
to
drift
away
this
gently
upon
the
current
of
my
thoughts
when
my
housekeeper
announced
in
a
tone
of
that
monsieur
coccoz
desired
to
speak
with
me
in
fact
some
one
had
slipped
into
the
library
after
her
he
was
a
little
man
a
poor
little
man
of
puny
appearance
wearing
a
thin
jacket
he
approached
me
with
a
number
of
little
bows
and
smiles
but
he
was
very
pale
and
although
still
young
and
alert
he
looked
ill
i
thought
as
i
looked
at
him
of
a
wounded
squirrel
he
carried
under
his
arm
a
green
toilette
which
he
put
upon
a
chair
then
unfastening
the
four
corners
of
the
toilette
he
uncovered
a
heap
of
little
yellow
books
monsieur
he
then
said
to
me
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
known
to
you
i
am
a
monsieur
i
represent
the
leading
houses
of
the
capital
and
in
the
hope
that
you
will
kindly
honour
me
with
your
confidence
i
take
the
liberty
to
offer
you
a
few
kind
gods
just
gods
such
novelties
as
the
homunculus
coccoz
showed
me
the
first
volume
that
he
put
in
my
hand
was
l
histoire
de
la
tour
de
nesle
with
the
amours
of
marguerite
de
bourgogne
and
the
captain
buridan
it
is
a
historical
book
he
said
to
me
with
a
smile
a
book
of
real
in
that
case
i
replied
it
must
be
very
tiresome
for
all
the
historical
books
which
contain
no
lies
are
extremely
tedious
i
write
some
authentic
ones
myself
and
if
you
were
unlucky
enough
to
carry
a
copy
of
any
of
them
from
door
to
door
you
would
run
the
risk
of
keeping
it
all
your
life
in
that
green
baize
of
yours
without
ever
finding
even
a
cook
foolish
enough
to
buy
it
from
certainly
monsieur
the
little
man
answered
out
of
pure
and
all
smiling
again
he
offered
me
the
amours
d
heloise
et
d
abeilard
but
i
made
him
understand
that
at
my
age
i
had
no
use
for
still
smiling
he
proposed
me
the
regle
des
jeux
de
la
societe
piquet
bezique
ecarte
whist
dice
draughts
and
chess
alas
i
said
to
him
if
you
want
to
make
me
remember
the
rules
of
bezique
give
me
back
my
old
friend
bignan
with
whom
i
used
to
play
cards
every
evening
before
the
five
academies
solemnly
escorted
him
to
the
cemetery
or
else
bring
down
to
the
frivolous
level
of
human
amusements
the
grave
intelligence
of
hamilcar
whom
you
see
on
that
cushion
for
he
is
the
sole
companion
of
my
the
little
man
s
smile
became
vague
and
uneasy
here
he
said
is
a
new
collection
of
society
amusements
jokes
and
puns
with
a
receipt
for
changing
a
red
rose
to
a
white
i
told
him
that
i
had
fallen
out
with
the
roses
for
a
long
time
and
that
as
to
jokes
i
was
satisfied
with
those
which
i
unconsciously
permitted
myself
to
make
in
the
course
of
my
scientific
labours
the
homunculus
offered
me
his
last
book
with
his
last
smile
he
said
to
me
here
is
the
clef
des
songes
the
key
of
dreams
with
the
explanation
of
any
dreams
that
anybody
can
have
dreams
of
gold
dreams
of
robbers
dreams
of
death
dreams
of
falling
from
the
top
of
a
tower
it
is
i
had
taken
hold
of
the
tongs
and
brandishing
them
energetically
i
replied
to
my
commercial
visitor
yes
my
friend
but
those
dreams
and
a
thousand
others
joyous
or
tragic
are
all
summed
up
in
one
the
dream
of
life
is
your
little
yellow
book
able
to
give
me
the
key
to
that
yes
monsieur
answered
the
homunculus
the
book
is
complete
and
it
is
not
dear
one
franc
centimes
i
called
my
housekeeper
for
there
is
no
bell
in
my
room
and
said
to
her
therese
monsieur
coccoz
whom
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
show
out
has
a
book
here
which
might
interest
you
the
key
of
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
buy
it
for
my
housekeeper
responded
monsieur
when
one
has
not
even
time
to
dream
awake
one
has
still
less
time
to
dream
asleep
thank
god
my
days
are
just
enough
for
my
work
and
my
work
for
my
days
and
i
am
able
to
say
every
night
lord
bless
thou
the
rest
which
i
am
going
to
i
never
dream
either
on
my
feet
or
in
bed
and
i
never
mistake
my
coverlet
for
a
devil
as
my
cousin
did
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
give
my
opinion
about
it
i
think
you
have
books
enough
here
now
monsieur
has
thousands
and
thousands
of
books
which
simply
turn
his
head
and
as
for
me
i
have
just
tow
which
are
quite
enough
for
all
my
wants
and
purposes
my
catholic
and
my
cuisiniere
and
with
those
words
my
housekeeper
helped
the
little
man
to
fasten
up
his
stock
again
within
the
green
toilette
the
homunculus
coccoz
had
ceased
to
smile
his
relaxed
features
took
such
an
expression
of
suffering
that
i
felt
sorry
to
have
made
fun
of
so
unhappy
a
man
i
called
him
back
and
told
him
that
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
copy
of
the
histoire
d
estelle
et
de
nemorin
which
he
had
among
his
books
that
i
was
very
fond
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
and
that
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
purchase
at
a
reasonable
price
the
story
of
these
two
perfect
lovers
i
will
sell
you
that
book
for
one
franc
centimes
monsieur
replied
coccoz
whose
face
at
once
beamed
with
joy
it
is
historical
and
you
will
be
pleased
with
it
i
know
now
just
what
suits
you
i
see
that
you
are
a
connoisseur
i
will
bring
you
the
crimes
des
papes
it
is
a
good
book
i
will
bring
you
the
edition
d
amateur
with
coloured
i
begged
him
not
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
and
sent
him
away
happy
when
the
green
toilette
and
the
agent
had
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
corridor
i
asked
my
housekeeper
whence
this
little
man
had
dropped
upon
us
dropped
is
the
word
she
answered
he
dropped
on
us
from
the
roof
monsieur
where
he
lives
with
his
you
say
he
has
a
wife
therese
that
is
marvelous
women
are
very
strange
creatures
this
one
must
be
a
very
unfortunate
little
i
don
t
really
know
what
she
is
answered
therese
but
every
morning
i
see
her
trailing
a
silk
dress
covered
with
over
the
stairs
she
makes
soft
eyes
at
people
and
in
the
name
of
common
sense
does
it
become
a
woman
that
has
been
received
here
out
of
charity
to
make
eyes
and
to
wear
dresses
like
that
for
they
allowed
the
couple
to
occupy
the
attic
during
the
time
the
roof
was
being
repaired
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
husband
is
sick
and
the
wife
in
an
interesting
condition
the
concierge
even
says
that
the
pain
came
on
her
this
morning
and
that
she
is
now
confined
they
must
have
been
very
badly
off
for
a
child
therese
i
replied
they
had
no
need
of
a
child
doubtless
but
nature
had
decided
that
they
should
bring
one
into
the
world
nature
made
them
fall
into
her
snare
one
must
have
exceptional
prudence
to
defeat
nature
s
schemes
let
us
be
sorry
for
them
and
not
blame
them
as
for
silk
dresses
there
is
no
young
woman
who
does
not
like
them
the
daughters
of
eve
adore
adornment
you
yourself
therese
who
are
so
serious
and
sensible
what
a
fuss
you
make
when
you
have
no
white
apron
to
wait
at
table
in
but
tell
me
have
they
got
everything
necessary
in
their
attic
how
could
they
have
it
monsieur
my
housekeeper
made
answer
the
husband
whom
you
have
just
seen
used
to
be
a
at
least
so
the
concierge
tells
me
and
nobody
knows
why
he
stopped
selling
watches
you
have
just
seen
that
his
is
now
selling
almanacs
that
is
no
way
to
make
an
honest
living
and
i
never
will
believe
that
god
s
blessing
can
come
to
an
between
ourselves
the
wife
looks
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
a
a
i
think
she
would
be
just
as
capable
of
bringing
up
a
child
as
i
should
be
of
playing
the
guitar
nobody
seems
to
know
where
they
came
from
but
i
am
sure
they
must
have
come
by
misery
s
coach
from
the
country
of
wherever
they
have
come
from
therese
they
are
unfortunate
and
their
attic
is
pardi
the
roof
is
broken
in
several
places
and
the
rain
comes
through
in
streams
they
have
neither
furniture
nor
clothing
i
don
t
think
and
weavers
work
much
for
christians
of
that
sect
that
is
very
sad
therese
a
christian
woman
much
less
well
provided
for
than
this
pagan
hamilcar
here
what
does
she
have
to
say
monsieur
i
never
speak
to
those
people
i
don
t
know
what
she
says
or
what
she
sings
but
she
sings
all
day
long
i
hear
her
from
the
stairway
whenever
i
am
going
out
or
coming
well
the
heir
of
the
coccoz
family
will
be
able
to
say
like
the
egg
in
the
village
riddle
ma
mere
me
fit
en
chantant
my
mother
sang
when
she
brought
me
into
the
the
like
happened
in
the
case
of
henry
iv
when
jeanne
d
albret
felt
herself
about
to
be
confined
she
began
to
sing
an
old
bearnaise
canticle
du
bout
du
pont
venez
a
mon
aide
en
cette
heure
priez
le
dieu
du
ciel
qu
il
me
delivre
vite
qu
il
me
donne
un
garcon
it
is
certainly
unreasonable
to
bring
little
unfortunates
into
the
world
but
the
thing
is
done
every
day
my
dear
therese
and
all
the
philosophers
on
earth
will
never
be
able
to
reform
the
silly
custom
madame
coccoz
has
followed
it
and
she
sings
this
is
creditable
at
all
events
but
tell
me
therese
have
you
not
put
the
soup
to
boil
yes
monsieur
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
and
skim
good
but
don
t
forget
therese
to
take
a
good
bowl
of
soup
out
of
the
pot
and
carry
it
to
madame
coccoz
our
attic
my
housekeeper
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
i
added
just
in
time
therese
before
you
do
anything
else
please
call
your
friend
the
porter
and
tell
him
to
take
a
good
bundle
of
wood
out
of
our
stock
and
carry
it
up
to
the
attic
of
those
coccoz
folks
see
above
all
that
he
puts
a
log
in
the
lot
a
real
christmas
log
as
for
the
homunculus
if
he
comes
back
again
do
not
allow
either
himself
or
any
of
his
yellow
books
to
come
in
having
taken
all
these
little
precautions
with
the
refined
egotism
of
an
old
bachelor
i
returned
to
my
catalogue
again
with
what
surprise
with
what
emotion
with
what
anxiety
did
i
therein
discover
the
following
mention
which
i
can
not
even
now
copy
without
feeling
my
hand
tremble
la
legende
doree
de
jacques
de
genes
jacques
de
voragine
traduction
francaise
petit
this
of
the
fourteenth
century
contains
besides
the
tolerably
complete
translation
of
the
celebrated
work
of
jacques
de
voragine
the
legends
of
saints
ferreol
ferrution
germain
vincent
and
droctoveus
a
poem
on
the
miraculous
burial
of
monsieur
of
this
translation
as
well
as
the
legends
and
the
poem
are
due
to
the
clerk
alexander
this
is
written
upon
vellum
it
contains
a
great
number
of
illuminated
letters
and
two
finely
executed
miniatures
in
a
rather
imperfect
state
of
preservation
one
represents
the
purification
of
the
virgin
and
the
other
the
coronation
of
what
a
discovery
perspiration
moistened
my
forehead
and
a
veil
seemed
to
come
before
my
eyes
i
trembled
i
flushed
and
without
being
able
to
speak
i
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
cry
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
what
a
treasure
for
more
than
forty
years
i
had
been
making
a
special
study
of
the
history
of
christian
gaul
and
particularly
of
that
glorious
abbey
of
whence
issued
forth
those
who
founded
our
national
dynasty
now
despite
the
culpable
insufficiency
of
the
description
given
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
of
the
clerk
alexander
must
have
come
from
the
great
abbey
everything
proved
this
fact
all
the
legends
added
by
the
translator
related
to
the
pious
foundation
of
the
abbey
by
king
childebert
then
the
legend
of
was
particularly
significant
being
the
legend
of
the
first
abbot
of
my
dear
abbey
the
poem
in
french
verse
on
the
burial
of
led
me
actually
into
the
nave
of
that
venerable
basilica
which
was
the
umbilicus
of
christian
gaul
the
golden
legend
is
in
itself
a
vast
and
gracious

de
voragine
definitor
of
the
order
of
and
archbishop
of
genoa
collected
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
various
legends
of
catholic
saints
and
formed
so
rich
a
compilation
that
from
all
the
monasteries
and
castles
of
the
time
there
arouse
the
cry
this
is
the
golden
the
legende
doree
was
especially
opulent
in
roman
hagiography
edited
by
an
italian
monk
it
reveals
its
best
merits
in
the
treatment
of
matters
relating
to
the
terrestrial
domains
of
saint
peter
voragine
can
only
perceive
the
greater
saints
of
the
occident
as
through
a
cold
mist
for
this
reason
the
aquitanian
and
saxon
translators
of
the
good
were
careful
to
add
to
his
recital
the
lives
of
their
own
national
saints
i
have
read
and
collated
a
great
many
manuscripts
of
the
golden
i
know
all
those
described
by
my
learned
colleague
paulin
paris
in
his
handsome
catalogue
of
the
mss
of
the
biblotheque
du
roi
there
were
two
among
them
which
especially
drew
my
attention
one
is
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
contains
a
translation
by
jean
belet
the
other
younger
by
a
century
presents
the
version
of
jacques
vignay
both
come
from
the
colbert
collection
and
were
placed
on
the
shelves
of
that
glorious
colbertine
library
by
the
librarian
baluze
whose
name
i
can
never
pronounce
without
uncovering
my
head
for
even
in
the
century
of
the
giants
of
erudition
baluze
astounds
by
his
greatness
i
know
also
a
very
curious
codex
in
the
bigot
collection
i
know
printed
editions
of
the
work
commencing
with
the
venerable
ancestor
of
all
the
gothic
of
strasburg
begun
in
and
finished
in
but
no
one
of
those
no
one
of
those
editions
contains
the
legends
of
saints
ferreol
ferrution
germain
vincent
and
droctoveus
no
one
bears
the
name
of
the
clerk
alexander
no
one
in
find
came
from
the
abbey
of
compared
with
the
described
by
thompson
they
are
only
as
straw
to
gold
i
have
seen
with
my
eyes
i
have
touched
with
my
fingers
an
incontrovertible
testimony
to
the
existence
of
this
document
but
the
document
itself
what
has
become
of
it
sir
thomas
raleigh
went
to
end
his
days
by
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
como
whither
he
carried
with
him
a
part
of
his
literary
wealth
where
did
the
books
go
after
the
death
of
that
aristocratic
collector
where
could
the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
have
gone
and
why
i
asked
myself
why
should
i
have
learned
that
this
precious
book
exists
if
i
am
never
to
possess
it
never
even
to
see
it
i
would
go
to
seek
it
in
the
burning
heart
of
africa
or
in
the
icy
regions
of
the
pole
if
i
knew
it
were
there
but
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
i
do
not
know
if
it
be
guarded
in
a
iron
case
by
some
jealous
biblomaniac
i
do
not
know
if
it
be
growing
mouldy
in
the
attic
of
some
ignoramus
i
shudder
at
the
thought
that
perhaps
its
leaves
may
have
been
used
to
cover
the
of
some
august
the
heavy
heat
compelled
me
to
walk
slowly
i
kept
close
to
the
walls
of
the
north
quays
and
in
the
lukewarm
shade
the
shops
of
the
dealers
in
old
books
engravings
and
antiquated
furniture
drew
my
eyes
and
appealed
to
my
fancy
rummaging
and
idling
among
these
i
hastily
enjoyed
some
verses
spiritedly
thrown
off
by
a
poet
of
the
pleiad
i
examined
an
elegant
masquerade
by
watteau
i
felt
with
my
eye
the
weight
of
a
sword
a
steel
gorgerin
a
morion
what
a
thick
helmet
what
a
ponderous
breastplate
seigneur
a
giant
s
garb
no
the
carapace
of
an
insect
the
men
of
those
days
were
cuirassed
like
beetles
their
weakness
was
within
them
on
the
contrary
our
strength
is
interior
and
our
armed
souls
dwell
in
feeble
bodies
here
is
a
of
a
lady
of
the
old
time
the
face
vague
like
a
shadow
smiles
and
a
hand
gloved
with
an
openwork
mitten
retains
upon
her
satiny
knees
a
with
a
ribbon
about
its
neck
that
picture
fills
me
with
a
sort
of
charming
melancholy
let
those
who
have
no
pastels
in
their
own
hearts
laugh
at
me
like
the
horse
that
scents
the
stable
i
hasten
my
pace
as
i
near
my
lodgings
there
it
is
that
great
human
hive
in
which
i
have
a
cell
for
the
purpose
of
therein
distilling
the
somewhat
acrid
honey
of
erudition
i
climb
the
stairs
with
slow
effort
only
a
few
steps
more
and
i
shall
be
at
my
own
door
but
i
divine
rather
than
see
a
robe
descending
with
a
sound
of
rustling
silk
i
stop
and
press
myself
against
the
balustrade
to
make
room
the
lady
who
is
coming
down
is
bareheaded
she
is
young
she
sings
her
eyes
and
teeth
gleam
in
the
shadow
for
she
laughs
with
lips
and
eyes
at
the
same
time
she
is
certainly
a
neighbor
and
a
very
familiar
one
she
holds
in
her
arms
a
pretty
child
a
little
boy
quite
naked
like
the
son
of
a
goddess
he
has
a
medal
hung
round
his
neck
by
a
little
silver
chain
i
see
him
sucking
his
thumb
and
looking
at
me
with
those
big
eyes
so
newly
opened
on
this
old
universe
the
mother
simultaneously
looks
at
me
in
a
sly
mysterious
way
she
stops
i
think
blushes
a
little
and
holds
out
the
little
creature
to
me
the
baby
has
a
pretty
wrinkle
between
wrist
and
arm
a
pretty
wrinkle
about
his
neck
and
all
over
him
from
head
to
foot
the
daintiest
dimples
laugh
in
his
rosy
flesh
the
mamma
shows
him
to
me
with
pride
monsieur
she
says
don
t
you
think
he
is
very
pretty
my
little
boy
she
takes
one
tiny
hand
lifts
it
to
the
child
s
own
lips
and
drawing
out
the
darling
pink
fingers
again
towards
me
says
baby
throw
the
gentleman
a
then
folding
the
little
being
in
her
arms
she
flees
away
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
and
is
lost
to
sight
in
a
corridor
which
judging
by
the
odour
must
lead
to
some
kitchen
i
enter
my
own
quarters
therese
who
can
that
young
mother
be
whom
i
saw
bareheaded
on
the
stairs
just
now
with
a
pretty
little
boy
and
therese
replies
that
it
was
madame
coccoz
i
stare
up
at
the
ceiling
as
if
trying
to
obtain
some
further
illumination
therese
then
recalls
to
me
the
little
who
tried
to
sell
me
almanacs
last
year
while
his
wife
was
lying
in
and
coccoz
himself
i
asked
i
was
answered
that
i
would
never
see
him
again
the
poor
little
man
had
been
laid
away
underground
without
my
knowledge
and
indeed
with
the
knowledge
of
very
few
people
on
a
short
time
after
the
happy
delivery
of
madame
coccoz
i
leaned
that
his
wife
had
been
able
to
console
herself
i
did
likewise
but
therese
i
asked
has
madame
coccoz
got
everything
she
needs
in
that
attic
of
hers
you
would
be
a
great
dupe
monsieur
replied
my
housekeeper
if
you
should
bother
yourself
about
that
creature
they
gave
her
notice
to
quit
the
attic
when
the
roof
was
repaired
but
she
stays
there
yet
in
spite
of
the
proprietor
the
agent
the
concierge
and
the
bailiffs
i
think
she
has
bewitched
every
one
of
them
she
will
leave
the
attic
when
she
pleases
monsieur
but
she
is
going
to
leave
in
her
own
carriage
let
me
tell
you
that
therese
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
uttered
these
words
a
pretty
face
is
a
curse
from
then
i
ought
to
thank
heaven
for
having
spared
me
that
curse
but
here
put
my
hat
and
cane
away
i
am
going
to
amuse
myself
with
a
few
pages
of
moreri
if
i
can
trust
my
old
we
are
going
to
have
a
nicely
flavoured
pullet
for
dinner
look
after
that
estimable
fowl
my
girl
and
spare
your
neighbors
so
that
you
and
your
old
master
may
be
spared
by
them
in
having
thus
spoken
i
proceeded
to
follow
out
the
tufted
ramifications
of
a
princely
genealogy
may
i
have
passed
the
winter
according
to
the
ideal
of
the
sages
in
angello
cum
libello
and
now
the
swallows
of
the
quai
malaquais
find
me
on
their
return
about
as
when
they
left
me
he
who
lives
little
changes
little
and
it
is
scarcely
living
at
all
to
use
up
one
s
days
over
old
texts
yet
i
feel
myself
a
little
more
deeply
impregnated
than
ever
before
with
that
vague
melancholy
which
life
distils
the
economy
of
my
intelligence
i
dare
scarcely
confess
it
to
myself
has
remained
disturbed
ever
since
that
momentous
hour
in
which
the
existence
of
the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
was
first
revealed
to
me
it
is
strange
that
i
should
have
lost
my
rest
simply
on
account
of
a
few
old
sheets
of
parchment
but
it
is
unquestionably
true
the
poor
man
who
has
no
desires
possesses
the
greatest
of
riches
he
possesses
himself
the
rich
man
who
desires
something
is
only
a
wretched
slave
i
am
just
such
a
slave
the
sweetest
pleasures
those
of
converse
with
some
one
of
a
delicate
and
mind
or
dining
out
with
a
friend
are
insufficient
to
enable
me
to
forget
the
manuscript
which
i
know
that
i
want
and
have
been
wanting
from
the
moment
i
knew
of
its
existence
i
feel
the
want
of
it
by
day
and
by
night
i
feel
the
want
of
it
in
all
my
joys
and
pains
i
feel
the
want
of
it
while
at
work
or
asleep
i
recall
my
desires
as
a
child
how
well
i
can
now
comprehend
the
intense
wishes
of
my
early
years
i
can
see
once
more
with
astonishing
vividness
a
certain
doll
which
when
i
was
eight
years
old
used
to
be
displayed
in
the
window
of
an
ugly
little
shop
of
the
rue
de
seine
i
can
not
tell
how
it
happened
that
this
doll
attracted
me
i
was
very
proud
of
being
a
boy
i
despised
little
girls
and
i
longed
impatiently
for
the
day
which
alas
has
come
when
a
strong
beard
should
bristle
on
my
chin
i
played
at
being
a
soldier
and
under
the
pretext
of
obtaining
forage
for
my
i
used
to
make
sad
havoc
among
the
plants
my
poor
mother
delighted
to
keep
on
her
manly
amusements
those
i
should
say
and
nevertheless
i
was
consumed
with
longing
for
a
doll
characters
like
hercules
have
such
weaknesses
occasionally
was
the
one
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
at
all
beautiful
no
i
can
see
her
now
she
had
a
splotch
of
vermilion
on
either
cheek
short
soft
arms
horrible
wooden
hands
and
long
sprawling
legs
her
flowered
petticoat
was
fastened
at
the
waist
with
two
pins
even
now
i
cans
see
the
black
heads
of
those
two
pins
it
was
a
decidedly
vulgar
doll
smelt
of
the
faubourg
i
remember
perfectly
well
that
child
as
i
was
then
before
i
had
put
on
my
first
pair
of
trousers
i
was
quite
conscious
in
my
own
way
that
this
doll
lacked
grace
and
style
that
she
was
gross
that
she
was
course
but
i
loved
her
in
spite
of
that
i
loved
her
just
for
that
i
loved
her
only
i
wanted
her
my
soldiers
and
my
drums
had
become
as
nothing
in
my
eyes
i
ceased
to
stick
sprigs
of
heliotrope
and
veronica
into
the
mouth
of
my
that
doll
was
all
the
world
to
me
i
invented
ruses
worthy
of
a
savage
to
oblige
virginie
my
nurse
to
take
me
by
the
little
shop
in
the
rue
de
seine
i
would
press
my
nose
against
the
window
until
my
nurse
had
to
take
my
arm
and
drag
me
away
monsieur
sylvestre
it
is
late
and
your
mamma
will
scold
monsieur
sylvestre
in
those
days
made
very
little
of
either
scoldings
or
whippings
but
his
nurse
lifted
him
up
like
a
feather
and
monsieur
sylvestre
yielded
to
force
in
with
age
he
degenerated
and
sometimes
yielded
to
fear
but
at
that
time
he
used
to
fear
nothing
i
was
unhappy
an
unreasoning
but
irresistible
shame
prevented
me
from
telling
my
mother
about
the
object
of
my
love
thence
all
my
sufferings
for
many
days
that
doll
incessantly
present
in
fancy
danced
before
my
eyes
stared
at
me
fixedly
opened
her
arms
to
me
assuming
in
my
imagination
a
sort
of
life
which
made
her
appear
at
once
mysterious
and
weird
and
thereby
all
the
more
charming
and
desirable
finally
one
day
a
day
i
shall
never
forget
my
nurse
took
me
to
see
my
uncle
captain
victor
who
had
invited
me
to
lunch
i
admired
my
uncle
a
great
deal
as
much
because
he
had
fired
the
last
french
cartridge
at
waterloo
as
because
he
used
to
prepare
with
his
own
hands
at
my
mother
s
table
certain
ail
crust
on
which
garlic
has
been
rubbed
which
he
afterwards
put
in
the
chicory
salad
i
thought
that
was
very
fine
my
uncle
victor
also
inspired
me
with
much
respect
by
his
frogged
coat
and
still
more
by
his
way
of
turning
the
whole
house
upside
down
from
the
moment
he
came
into
it
even
now
i
can
not
tell
just
how
he
managed
it
but
i
can
affirm
that
whenever
my
uncle
victor
found
himself
in
any
assembly
of
twenty
persons
it
was
impossible
to
see
or
to
hear
anybody
but
him
my
excellent
father
i
have
reason
to
believe
never
shared
my
admiration
for
uncle
victor
who
used
to
sicken
him
with
his
pipe
give
him
great
thumps
in
the
back
by
way
of
friendliness
and
accuse
him
of
lacking
energy
my
mother
though
always
showing
a
sister
s
indulgence
to
the
captain
sometimes
advised
him
to
fold
the
a
little
less
frequently
but
i
had
no
part
either
in
these
repugnances
or
these
reproaches
and
uncle
victor
inspired
me
with
the
purest
enthusiasm
it
was
therefore
with
a
feeling
of
pride
that
i
entered
into
the
little
lodging
he
occupied
in
the
rue
guenegaud
the
entire
lunch
served
on
a
small
table
close
to
the
fireplace
consisted
of
cold
meats
and
confectionery
the
captain
stuffed
me
with
cakes
and
undiluted
wine
he
told
me
of
numberless
injustices
to
which
he
had
been
a
victim
he
complained
particularly
of
the
bourbons
and
as
he
neglected
to
tell
me
who
the
bourbons
were
i
got
the
idea
i
can
t
tell
how
that
the
bourbons
were
established
at
waterloo
the
captain
who
never
interrupted
his
talk
except
for
the
purpose
of
pouring
out
wine
furthermore
made
charges
against
a
number
of
dirty
scoundrels
blackguards
and
whom
i
did
not
know
anything
about
but
whom
i
hated
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
at
dessert
i
thought
i
heard
the
captain
say
my
father
was
a
man
who
could
be
led
anywhere
by
the
nose
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
understood
him
i
had
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
table
was
dancing
my
uncle
put
on
his
frogged
coat
took
his
bell
shaped
hat
and
we
descended
to
the
street
which
seemed
to
me
singularly
changed
it
looked
to
me
as
if
i
had
not
been
in
it
before
for
ever
so
long
a
time
nevertheless
when
we
came
to
the
rue
de
seine
the
idea
of
my
doll
suddenly
returned
to
my
mind
and
excited
me
in
an
extraordinary
way
my
head
was
on
fire
i
resolved
upon
a
desperate
expedient
we
were
passing
before
the
window
she
was
there
behind
the
glass
with
her
red
checks
and
her
flowered
petticoat
and
her
long
legs
uncle
i
said
with
a
great
effort
will
you
buy
that
doll
for
me
and
i
waited
buy
a
doll
for
a
boy
sacrebleu
cried
my
uncle
in
a
voice
of
thunder
do
you
wish
to
dishonour
yourself
and
it
is
that
old
mag
there
that
you
want
well
i
must
compliment
you
my
young
fellow
if
you
grow
up
with
such
tastes
as
that
you
will
never
have
any
pleasure
in
life
and
your
comrades
will
call
you
a
precious
ninny
if
you
asked
me
for
a
sword
or
a
gun
my
boy
i
would
buy
them
for
you
with
the
last
silver
crown
of
my
pension
but
to
buy
a
doll
for
you
by
all
that
s
holy
to
disgrace
you
never
in
the
world
why
if
i
were
ever
to
see
you
playing
with
a
puppet
rigged
out
like
that
monsieur
my
sister
s
son
i
would
disown
you
for
my
nephew
on
hearing
these
words
i
felt
my
heart
so
wrung
that
nothing
but
pride
a
diabolical
pride
kept
me
from
crying
my
uncle
suddenly
calming
down
returned
to
his
ideas
about
the
bourbons
but
i
still
smarting
under
the
weight
of
his
indignation
felt
an
unspeakable
shame
my
resolve
was
quickly
made
i
promised
myself
never
to
disgrace
myself
i
firmly
and
for
ever
renounced
that
doll
i
felt
that
day
for
the
first
time
the
austere
sweetness
of
sacrifice
captain
though
it
be
true
that
all
your
life
you
swore
like
a
pagan
smoked
like
a
beadle
and
drank
like
a
be
your
memory
nevertheless
honoured
not
merely
because
you
were
a
brave
soldier
but
also
because
you
revealed
to
your
little
nephew
in
petticoats
the
sentiment
of
heroism
pride
and
laziness
had
made
you
almost
insupportable
uncle
victor
but
a
great
heart
used
to
beat
under
those
frogs
upon
your
coat
you
always
used
to
wear
i
now
remember
a
rose
in
your
that
rose
which
you
offered
so
readily
to
the
that
large
flower
scattering
its
petals
to
all
the
winds
was
the
symbol
of
your
glorious
youth
you
despised
neither
wine
nor
tobacco
but
you
despised
life
neither
delicacy
nor
common
sense
could
have
been
learned
from
you
captain
but
you
taught
me
even
at
an
age
when
my
nurse
had
to
wipe
my
nose
a
lesson
of
honour
and
that
i
shall
never
forget
you
have
now
been
sleeping
for
many
years
in
the
cemetery
of
under
a
plain
slab
bearing
the
epitaph
aristide
victor
maldent
capitaine
d
infanterie
chevalier
de
la
legion
d
honneur
but
such
captain
was
not
the
inscription
devised
by
yourself
to
be
placed
above
those
old
bones
of
yours
knocked
about
so
long
on
fields
of
battle
and
in
haunts
of
pleasure
among
your
papers
was
found
this
proud
and
bitter
epitaph
which
despite
your
last
will
none
could
have
ventured
to
put
upon
your
tomb
un
brigand
de
la
loire
therese
we
will
get
a
wreath
of
immortelles
and
lay
them
on
the
tomb
of
the
brigand
of
the
but
therese
is
not
here
and
how
indeed
could
she
be
near
me
seeing
that
i
am
at
the
rondpoint
of
the
there
at
the
termination
of
the
avenue
the
arc
de
triomphe
which
bears
under
its
vaults
the
names
of
uncle
victor
s
opens
its
giant
gate
against
the
sky
the
trees
of
the
avenue
are
unfolding
to
the
sun
of
spring
their
first
leaves
still
all
pale
and
chilly
beside
me
the
carriages
keep
rolling
by
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
unconsciously
i
have
wandered
into
this
fashionable
avenue
on
my
promenade
and
halted
quite
stupidly
in
front
of
a
booth
stocked
with
gingerbread
and
decanters
of
each
topped
by
a
lemon
a
miserable
little
boy
covered
with
rags
which
expose
his
chapped
skin
stares
with
widely
opened
eyes
at
those
sumptuous
sweets
which
are
not
for
such
as
he
with
the
shamelessness
of
innocence
he
betrays
his
longing
his
round
fixed
eyes
contemplate
a
certain
gingerbread
man
of
lofty
stature
it
is
a
general
and
it
looks
a
little
like
uncle
victor
i
take
it
i
pay
for
it
and
present
it
to
the
little
pauper
who
dares
not
extend
his
hand
to
receive
it
for
by
reason
of
precocious
experience
he
can
not
believe
in
luck
he
looks
at
me
in
the
same
way
that
certain
big
dogs
do
with
the
air
of
one
saying
you
are
cruel
to
make
fun
of
me
like
that
come
little
stupid
i
say
to
him
in
that
rough
tone
i
am
accustomed
to
use
take
it
take
it
and
eat
it
for
you
happier
than
i
was
at
your
age
you
can
satisfy
your
tastes
without
disgracing
and
you
uncle
victor
you
whose
manly
figure
has
been
recalled
to
me
by
that
gingerbread
general
come
glorious
shadow
help
me
to
forget
my
new
doll
we
remain
for
ever
children
and
are
always
running
after
new
toys
same
day
in
the
oddest
way
that
coccoz
family
has
become
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
clerk
alexander
therese
i
said
as
i
threw
myself
into
my
tell
me
if
the
little
coccoz
is
well
and
whether
he
has
got
his
first
teeth
yet
and
bring
me
my
he
ought
to
have
them
by
this
time
monsieur
replied
therese
but
i
never
saw
them
the
very
first
fine
day
of
spring
the
mother
disappeared
with
the
child
leaving
furniture
and
clothes
and
everything
behind
her
they
found
empty
in
the
attic
it
passes
all
belief
she
had
visitors
latterly
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
she
is
not
now
in
a
convent
of
nuns
the
niece
of
the
concierge
says
she
saw
her
driving
about
in
a
carriage
on
the
boulevards
i
always
told
you
she
would
end
therese
i
replied
that
young
woman
has
not
ended
either
badly
or
well
as
yet
wait
until
the
term
of
her
life
is
over
before
you
judge
her
and
be
careful
not
to
talk
too
much
with
that
concierge
it
seemed
to
me
though
i
only
saw
her
for
a
moment
on
the
stairs
that
madame
coccoz
was
very
fond
of
her
child
for
that
mother
s
love
at
least
she
deserves
as
far
as
that
goes
monsieur
certainly
the
little
one
never
wanted
for
anything
in
all
the
quarter
one
could
not
have
found
a
child
better
kept
or
better
nourished
or
more
petted
and
coddled
every
day
that
god
makes
she
puts
a
clean
bib
on
him
and
sings
to
him
to
make
him
laugh
from
morning
till
therese
a
poet
has
said
that
child
whose
mother
has
never
smiled
upon
him
is
worthy
neither
of
the
table
of
the
gods
nor
of
the
couch
of
the
july
having
been
informed
that
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
at
was
being
repaved
i
entered
the
church
with
the
hope
of
discovering
some
old
inscriptions
possibly
exposed
by
the
labours
of
the
workmen
i
was
not
disappointed
the
architect
kindly
showed
me
a
stone
which
he
had
just
had
raised
up
against
the
wall
i
knelt
down
to
look
at
the
inscription
engraved
upon
that
stone
and
then
half
aloud
i
read
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
apsis
these
words
which
made
my
heart
leap

wiped
gently
away
with
my
handkerchief
the
dust
covering
that
gravestone
i
could
have
kissed
it
it
is
he
it
is
alexander
i
cried
out
and
from
the
height
of
the
vaults
the
name
fell
back
upon
me
with
a
clang
as
if
broken
the
silent
severity
of
the
beadle
whom
i
saw
advancing
towards
me
made
me
ashamed
of
my
enthusiasm
and
i
fled
between
the
two
holy
water
sprinklers
with
which
tow
rival
rats
d
eglise
seemed
desirous
of
barring
my
way
at
all
events
it
was
certainly
my
own
alexander
there
could
be
no
more
doubt
possible
the
translator
of
the
golden
legend
the
author
of
the
saints
lives
of
saints
germain
vincent
ferreol
ferrution
and
droctoveus
was
just
as
i
had
supposed
a
monk
of
and
what
a
monk
too
pious
and
generous
he
had
a
silver
chin
a
silver
head
and
a
silver
foot
made
that
certain
precious
remains
should
be
covered
with
an
incorruptible
envelope
but
shall
i
never
be
able
to
view
his
handiwork
or
is
this
new
discovery
only
destined
to
increase
my
regrets
august
i
that
please
some
try
all
both
joy
and
terror
of
good
and
bad
that
make
and
unfold
error
now
take
upon
me
in
the
name
of
time
to
use
my
wings
impute
it
not
a
crime
to
me
or
my
swift
passage
that
i
slide
o
er
who
speaks
thus
tis
an
old
man
whom
i
know
too
well
it
is
time
shakespeare
after
having
terminated
the
third
act
of
the
winter
s
tale
pauses
in
order
to
leave
time
for
little
perdita
to
grow
up
in
wisdom
and
in
beauty
and
when
he
raises
the
curtain
again
he
evokes
the
ancient
upon
the
stage
to
render
account
to
the
audience
of
those
many
long
days
which
have
weighted
down
upon
the
head
of
the
jealous
leontes
like
shakespeare
in
his
play
i
have
left
in
this
diary
of
mine
a
long
interval
to
oblivion
and
after
the
fashion
of
the
poet
i
make
time
himself
intervene
to
explain
the
omission
of
ten
whole
years
ten
whole
years
indeed
have
passed
since
i
wrote
one
single
line
in
this
diary
and
now
that
i
take
up
the
pen
again
i
have
not
the
pleasure
alas
to
describe
a
perdita
now
grown
in
youth
and
beauty
are
the
faithful
companions
of
poets
but
those
charming
phantoms
scarcely
visit
the
rest
of
us
even
for
the
space
of
a
season
we
do
not
know
how
to
retain
them
with
us
if
the
fair
shade
of
some
perdita
should
ever
through
some
inconceivable
whim
take
a
notion
to
traverse
my
brain
she
would
hurt
herself
horribly
against
heaps
of
parchments
happy
the
poets
their
white
hairs
never
scare
away
the
hovering
shades
of
helens
francescas
juliets
julias
and
dorotheas
but
the
nose
alone
of
sylvestre
bonnard
would
put
to
flight
the
whole
swarm
of
love
s
heroines
yet
i
like
others
have
felt
beauty
i
have
known
that
mysterious
charm
which
nature
has
lent
to
animate
form
and
the
clay
which
lives
has
given
to
me
that
shudder
of
delight
which
makes
the
lover
and
the
poet
but
i
have
never
known
either
how
to
love
or
how
to
sing
now
in
my
memory
all
encumbered
as
it
is
with
the
rubbish
of
old
texts
i
can
discern
again
like
a
miniature
forgotten
in
some
attic
a
certain
bright
young
face
with
violet
eyes
why
bonnard
my
friend
what
an
old
fool
you
are
becoming
read
that
catalogue
which
a
florentine
bookseller
sent
you
this
very
morning
it
is
a
catalogue
of
manuscripts
and
he
promises
you
a
description
of
several
famous
ones
long
preserved
by
the
collectors
of
italy
and
sicily
there
is
something
better
suited
to
you
something
more
in
keeping
with
your
present
appearance
i
read
i
cry
out
hamilcar
who
has
assumed
with
the
approach
of
age
an
air
of
gravity
that
intimidates
me
looks
at
me
reproachfully
and
seems
to
ask
me
whether
there
is
any
rest
in
this
world
since
he
can
not
enjoy
it
beside
me
who
am
old
also
like
himself
in
the
sudden
joy
of
my
discovery
i
need
a
confidant
and
it
is
to
the
sceptic
hamilcar
that
i
address
myself
with
all
the
effusion
of
a
happy
man
no
hamilcar
no
i
said
to
him
there
is
no
rest
in
this
world
and
the
quietude
which
you
long
for
is
incompatible
with
the
duties
of
life
and
you
say
that
we
are
old
indeed
listen
to
what
i
read
in
this
catalogue
and
then
tell
me
whether
this
is
a
time
to
be

thomas

now
in
the
private
study
of
signor

of
you
hear
that

the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
is
in
sicily
at
the
house
of
polizzi
heaven
grant
he
may
be
a
friend
of
learned
men
i
am
going
to
write
him
which
i
did
forthwith
in
my
letter
i
requested
signor
polizzi
to
allow
me
to
examine
the
manuscript
of
clerk
alexander
stating
on
what
grounds
i
ventured
to
consider
myself
worthy
of
so
great
a
favour
i
offered
at
the
same
time
to
put
at
his
disposal
several
unpublished
texts
in
my
own
possession
not
devoid
of
interest
i
begged
him
to
favour
me
with
a
prompt
reply
and
below
my
signature
i
wrote
down
all
my
honorary
titles
monsieur
monsieur
where
are
you
running
like
that
cried
therese
quite
alarmed
coming
down
the
stairs
in
pursuit
of
me
four
steps
at
a
time
with
my
hat
in
her
hand
i
am
going
to
post
a
letter
good
god
is
that
a
way
to
run
out
in
the
street
bareheaded
like
a
crazy
man
i
am
crazy
i
know
therese
but
who
is
not
give
me
my
hat
quick
and
your
gloves
monsieur
and
your
umbrella
i
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
but
still
heard
her
protesting
and
lamenting
october
i
awaited
signor
polizzi
s
reply
with
impatience
i
could
not
even
remain
quiet
i
would
make
sudden
nervous
gestures
open
books
and
violently
close
them
again
one
day
i
happened
to
upset
a
book
with
my
elbow
a
volume
of
moreri
hamilcar
who
was
washing
himself
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
angrily
at
me
with
his
paw
over
his
ear
was
this
the
tumultuous
existence
he
must
expect
under
my
roof
had
there
not
been
a
tacit
understanding
between
us
that
we
should
live
a
peaceful
life
i
had
broken
the
covenant
my
poor
dear
comrade
i
made
answer
i
am
the
victim
of
a
violent
passion
which
agitates
and
masters
me
the
passions
are
enemies
of
peace
and
quiet
i
acknowledge
but
without
them
there
would
be
no
arts
or
industries
in
the
world
everybody
would
sleep
naked
on
a
and
you
would
not
be
able
hamilcar
to
repose
all
day
on
a
silken
cushion
in
the
city
of
i
expatiated
no
further
to
hamilcar
on
the
theory
of
the
passions
however
because
my
housekeeper
brought
me
a
letter
it
bore
the
postmark
of
naples
and
read
as
follows
most
illustrious
sir
i
do
indeed
possess
that
incomparable
manuscript
of
the
golden
legend
which
could
not
escape
your
keen
observation
reasons
however
forbid
me
imperiously
tyrannically
to
let
the
manuscript
go
out
of
my
possession
for
a
single
day
for
even
a
single
minute
it
will
be
a
joy
and
pride
for
me
to
have
you
examine
it
in
my
humble
home
in
girgenti
which
will
be
embellished
and
illuminated
by
your
presence
it
is
with
the
most
anxious
expectation
of
your
visit
that
i
presume
to
sign
myself
seigneur
academician
your
humble
and
devoted
servant
polizzi
and
archaeologist
at
girgenti
well
then
i
will
go
to
sicily
extremum
hunc

mihi
concede
october
my
resolve
had
been
taken
and
my
preparations
made
it
only
remained
for
me
to
notify
my
housekeeper
i
must
acknowledge
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
her
i
was
going
away
i
feared
her
remonstrances
her
railleries
her
objurgations
her
tears
she
is
a
good
kind
girl
i
said
to
myself
she
is
attacked
to
me
she
will
want
to
prevent
me
from
going
and
the
lord
knows
that
when
she
has
her
mind
set
upon
anything
gestures
and
cries
cost
her
no
effort
in
this
instance
she
will
be
sure
to
call
the
concierge
the
scrubber
the
and
the
seven
sons
of
the
they
will
all
kneel
down
in
a
circle
around
me
they
will
begin
to
cry
and
then
they
will
look
so
ugly
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
yield
so
as
not
to
have
the
pain
of
seeing
them
any
such
were
the
awful
images
the
sick
dreams
which
fear
marshaled
before
my
imagination
yes
fear
fecund
fear
as
the
poet
says
gave
birth
to
these
monstrosities
in
my
brain
for
i
may
as
well
make
the
confession
in
these
private
pages
i
am
afraid
of
my
housekeeper
i
am
aware
that
she
knows
i
am
weak
and
this
fact
alone
is
sufficient
to
dispel
all
my
courage
in
any
contest
with
her
contests
are
of
frequent
occurrence
and
i
invariably
succumb
but
for
all
that
i
had
to
announce
my
departure
to
therese
she
came
into
the
library
with
an
armful
of
wood
to
make
a
little
fire
une
flambe
she
said
for
the
mornings
are
chilly
i
watched
her
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
while
she
crouched
down
at
the
hearth
with
her
head
in
the
opening
of
the
fireplace
i
do
not
know
how
i
then
found
the
courage
to
speak
but
i
did
so
without
much
hesitation
i
got
up
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
observed
in
a
careless
tone
with
that
swaggering
manner
characteristic
of
cowards
by
the
way
therese
i
am
going
to
having
thus
spoken
i
awaited
the
consequence
with
great
anxiety
therese
did
not
reply
her
head
and
her
vast
cap
remained
buried
in
the
fireplace
and
nothing
in
her
person
which
i
closely
watched
betrayed
the
least
emotion
she
poked
some
paper
under
the
wood
and
blew
up
the
fire
that
was
all
finally
i
saw
her
face
again
it
was
calm
so
calm
that
it
made
me
vexed
surely
i
thought
to
myself
this
old
maid
has
no
heart
she
lets
me
go
away
without
saying
so
much
as
ah
can
the
absence
of
her
old
master
really
affect
her
so
little
well
then
go
monsieur
she
answered
at
last
only
be
back
here
by
six
o
clock
there
is
a
dish
for
dinner
which
will
not
wait
for
naples

a
i
understand
my
friend
for
three
centimes
i
can
eat
drink
and
wash
my
face
all
by
means
of
one
of
those
slices
of
watermelon
you
display
there
on
a
little
table
but
occidental
prejudices
would
prevent
me
from
enjoying
that
simple
pleasure
freely
and
frankly
and
how
could
i
suck
a
watermelon
i
have
enough
to
do
merely
to
keep
on
my
feet
in
this
crowd
what
a
luminous
noisy
night
in
the
strada
di
porto
mountains
of
fruit
tower
up
in
the
shops
illuminated
by
multicoloured
lanterns
upon
charcoal
furnaces
lighted
in
the
open
air
water
boils
and
steams
and
ragouts
are
singing
in
the
smell
of
fried
fish
and
hot
meats
tickles
my
nose
and
makes
me
sneeze
at
this
moment
i
find
that
my
handkerchief
has
left
the
pocket
of
my
i
am
pushed
lifted
up
and
turned
about
in
every
direction
by
the
gayest
the
most
talkative
the
most
animated
and
the
most
adroit
populace
possible
to
imagine
and
suddenly
a
young
woman
of
the
people
while
i
am
admiring
her
magnificent
hair
with
a
single
shock
of
her
powerful
elastic
shoulder
pushes
me
staggering
three
paces
back
at
least
without
injury
into
the
arms
of
a
who
receives
me
with
a
smile
i
am
in
naples
how
i
ever
managed
to
arrive
here
with
a
few
mutilated
and
shapeless
remains
of
baggage
i
can
not
tell
because
i
am
no
longer
myself
i
have
been
travelling
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
fright
and
i
think
that
i
must
have
looked
awhile
ago
in
this
bright
city
like
an
owl
bewildered
by
sunshine
it
is
much
worse
wishing
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
popular
manners
i
went
to
the
strada
di
porto
where
i
now
am
all
about
me
animated
throngs
of
people
crowd
and
press
before
the
and
i
float
like
a
waif
among
these
living
surges
which
even
while
they
submerge
you
still
caress
for
this
neopolitan
people
has
in
its
very
vivacity
something
indescribably
gentle
and
polite
i
am
not
roughly
jostled
i
am
merely
swayed
about
and
i
think
that
by
dint
of
thus
rocking
me
to
and
fro
these
good
folks
want
to
lull
me
asleep
on
my
feet
i
admire
as
i
tread
the
lava
pavements
of
the
strada
those
porters
and
fishermen
who
move
by
me
chatting
singing
smoking
gesticulating
quarrelling
and
embracing
each
other
the
next
moment
with
astonishing
versatility
of
mood
they
live
through
all
their
sense
at
the
same
time
and
being
philosophers
without
knowing
it
keep
the
measure
of
their
desires
in
accordance
with
the
brevity
of
life
i
approach
a
tavern
and
see
inscribed

friends
let
us
merrily
eat
and
drink
as
long
as
oil
remains
in
the
lamp
who
knows
if
we
shall
meet
again
in
another
world
who
knows
if
in
the
other
world
there
will
be
a
tavern
even
such
counsels
was
horace
wont
to
give
to
his
friends
you
received
them
posthumus
you
heard
them
also
leuconoe
perverse
beauty
who
wished
to
know
the
secrets
of
the
future
that
future
is
now
the
past
and
we
know
it
well
of
a
truth
you
were
foolish
to
worry
yourselves
about
so
small
a
matter
and
your
friend
showed
his
good
sense
when
he
told
you
to
take
life
wisely
and
to
filter
your
greek
wines
sapias
vina
even
thus
the
sight
of
a
fair
land
under
a
spotless
sky
urges
to
the
pursuit
of
quiet
pleasures
but
there
are
souls
for
ever
harassed
by
some
sublime
discontent
those
are
the
noblest
you
were
of
such
leuconoe
and
i
visiting
for
the
first
time
in
my
declining
years
that
city
where
your
beauty
was
famed
of
old
i
salute
with
deep
respect
your
melancholy
memory
those
souls
of
kin
to
your
own
who
appeared
in
the
age
of
christianity
were
souls
of
saints
and
the
golden
legend
is
full
of
the
miracles
they
wrought
your
friend
horace
left
a
less
noble
posterity
and
i
see
one
of
his
descendants
in
the
person
of
that
tavern
poet
who
at
this
moment
is
serving
out
wine
in
cups
under
the
epicurean
motto
of
his
sign
and
yet
life
decides
in
favour
of
friend
flaccus
and
his
philosophy
is
the
only
one
which
adapts
itself
to
the
course
of
events
there
is
a
fellow
leaning
against
that
covered
with
and
eating
an
ice
while
watching
the
stars
he
would
not
stoop
even
to
pick
up
the
old
manuscript
i
am
going
to
seek
with
so
much
trouble
and
fatigue
and
in
truth
man
is
made
rather
to
eat
ices
than
to
pore
over
old
texts
i
continued
to
wander
about
among
the
drinkers
and
the
singers
there
were
lovers
biting
into
beautiful
fruit
each
with
an
arm
about
the
other
s
waist
man
must
be
naturally
bad
for
all
this
strange
joy
only
evoked
in
me
a
feeling
of
uttermost
despondency
that
thronging
populace
displayed
such
artless
delight
in
the
simple
act
of
living
that
all
the
shynesses
begotten
by
my
old
habits
as
an
author
awoke
and
intensified
into
something
like
fright
furthermore
i
found
myself
much
discouraged
by
my
inability
to
understand
a
word
of
all
the
storm
of
chatter
about
me
it
was
a
humiliating
experience
for
a
philologist
thus
i
had
begun
to
feel
quite
sulky
when
i
was
startled
to
hear
someone
behind
me
observe
dimitri
that
old
man
is
certainly
a
frenchman
he
looks
so
bewildered
that
i
really
fell
sorry
for
him
shall
i
speak
to
him
he
has
such
a
look
with
that
round
back
of
his
do
you
not
think
so
dimitri
it
was
said
in
french
by
a
woman
s
voice
for
the
moment
it
was
disagreeable
to
hear
myself
spoken
of
as
an
old
man
is
a
man
old
at
only
the
other
day
on
the
pont
des
arts
my
colleague
perrot
d
avrignac
complimented
me
on
my
youthful
appearance
and
i
should
think
him
a
better
authority
about
one
s
age
than
that
young
chatterbox
who
has
taken
it
on
herself
to
make
remarks
about
my
back
my
back
is
round
she
says
ah
ah
i
had
some
suspicion
myself
to
that
effect
but
i
am
not
going
now
to
believe
it
at
all
since
it
is
the
opinion
of
a
young
woman
certainly
i
will
not
turn
my
head
round
to
see
who
it
was
that
spoke
but
i
am
sure
it
was
a
pretty
woman
why
because
she
talks
like
a
capricious
person
and
like
a
spoiled
child
ugly
women
may
be
naturally
quite
as
capricious
as
pretty
ones
but
as
they
are
never
petted
and
spoiled
and
as
no
allowances
are
made
for
them
they
soon
find
themselves
obliged
either
to
suppress
their
whims
or
to
hide
them
on
the
other
hand
the
pretty
women
can
be
just
as
fantastical
as
they
please
my
neighbour
is
evidently
one
of
the
latter
but
after
all
coming
to
think
it
over
she
really
did
nothing
worse
than
to
express
in
her
own
way
a
kindly
thought
about
me
for
which
i
ought
to
feel
grateful
these
reflections
include
the
last
and
decisive
one
passed
through
my
mind
in
less
than
a
second
and
if
i
have
taken
a
whole
minute
to
tell
them
it
is
characteristic
of
most
philologists
in
less
than
a
second
therefore
after
the
voice
had
ceased
i
did
turn
round
and
saw
a
pretty
little
woman
a
sprightly
brunette
madame
i
said
with
a
bow
excuse
my
involuntary
indiscretion
i
could
not
help
overhearing
what
you
have
just
said
you
would
like
to
be
of
service
to
a
poor
old
man
and
the
wish
madame
has
already
been
fulfilled
the
mere
sound
of
a
french
voice
has
given
me
such
pleasure
that
i
must
thank
i
bowed
again
and
turned
to
go
away
but
my
foot
slipped
upon
a
and
i
should
certainly
have
embraced
the
parthenopean
soil
had
not
the
young
lady
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
me
there
is
a
force
in
circumstances
even
in
the
very
smallest
circumstances
against
which
resistance
is
vain
i
resigned
myself
to
remain
the
protege
of
the
fair
unknown
it
is
late
she
said
do
you
not
wish
to
go
back
to
your
hotel
which
must
be
quite
close
to
ours
unless
it
be
the
same
one
madame
i
replied
i
do
not
know
what
time
it
is
because
somebody
has
stolen
my
watch
but
i
think
as
you
say
that
it
must
be
time
to
retire
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
regain
my
hotel
in
the
company
of
such
courteous
so
saying
i
bowed
once
more
to
the
young
lady
and
also
saluted
her
companion
a
silent
colossus
with
a
gentle
and
melancholy
face
after
having
gone
a
little
way
with
them
i
learned
among
other
matters
that
my
new
acquaintances
were
the
prince
and
princess
trepof
and
that
they
were
making
a
trip
round
the
world
for
the
purpose
of
finding
of
which
they
were
making
a
collection
we
proceeded
along
a
narrow
tortuous
vicoletto
lighted
only
by
a
single
lamp
burning
in
the
niche
of
a
madonna
the
purity
and
transparency
of
the
air
gave
a
celestial
softness
and
clearness
to
the
very
darkness
itself
and
one
could
find
one
s
way
without
difficulty
under
such
a
limpid
night
but
in
a
little
while
we
began
to
pass
through
a
venella
or
in
neopolitan
parlance
a
sottoportico
which
led
under
so
many
archways
and
so
many
balconies
that
no
gleam
of
light
from
the
sky
could
reach
us
my
young
guide
had
made
us
take
this
route
as
a
short
cut
she
assured
us
but
i
think
she
did
so
quite
as
much
simply
in
order
to
show
that
she
felt
at
home
in
naples
and
knew
the
city
thoroughly
indeed
she
needed
to
know
it
very
thoroughly
to
venture
by
night
into
that
labyrinth
of
subterranean
alleys
and
flights
of
steps
if
ever
any
many
showed
absolute
docility
in
allowing
himself
to
be
guided
that
man
was
myself
dante
never
followed
the
steps
of
beatrice
with
more
confidence
than
i
felt
in
following
those
of
princess
trepof
the
lady
appeared
to
find
some
pleasure
in
my
conversation
for
she
invited
me
to
take
a
with
her
on
the
morrow
to
visit
the
grotto
of
posilippo
and
the
tomb
of
virgil
she
declared
she
had
seen
me
somewhere
before
but
she
could
not
remember
if
it
had
been
a
stockholm
or
at
canton
in
the
former
event
i
was
a
very
celebrated
professor
of
geology
in
the
latter
a
whose
courtesy
and
kindness
had
been
much
appreciated
one
thing
certain
was
that
she
had
seen
my
back
somewhere
before
excuse
me
she
added
we
are
continually
travelling
my
husband
and
i
to
collect
and
to
change
our
ennui
by
changing
country
perhaps
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
content
ourselves
with
a
single
variety
of
ennui
but
we
have
made
all
our
preparations
and
arrangements
for
travelling
all
our
plans
have
been
laid
out
in
advance
and
it
gives
us
no
trouble
whereas
it
would
be
very
troublesome
for
us
to
stop
anywhere
in
particular
i
tell
you
all
this
so
that
you
many
not
be
surprised
if
my
recollections
have
become
a
little
mixed
up
but
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
you
at
a
distance
this
evening
i
felt
in
fact
i
knew
that
i
had
seen
you
before
now
the
question
is
where
was
it
that
i
saw
you
you
are
not
then
either
the
geologist
or
the
no
madame
i
replied
i
am
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
since
you
have
had
reason
to
esteem
them
there
is
really
nothing
about
me
worthy
of
your
interest
i
have
spent
all
my
life
poring
over
books
and
i
have
never
traveled
you
might
have
known
that
from
my
bewilderment
which
excited
your
compassion
i
am
a
member
of
the
you
are
a
member
of
the
institute
how
nice
will
you
not
write
something
for
me
in
my
album
do
you
know
chinese
i
would
like
so
much
to
have
you
write
something
in
chinese
or
persian
in
my
album
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
friend
miss
fergusson
who
travels
everywhere
to
see
all
the
famous
people
in
the
world
she
will
be
delighted
dimitri
did
you
hear
that
this
gentleman
is
a
member
of
the
institute
and
he
has
passed
all
his
life
over
the
prince
nodded
approval
monsieur
i
said
trying
to
engage
him
in
our
conversation
it
is
true
that
something
can
be
learned
from
books
but
a
great
deal
more
can
be
learned
by
travelling
and
i
regret
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
go
round
the
world
like
you
i
have
lived
in
the
same
house
for
thirty
years
and
i
scarcely
every
go
lived
in
the
same
house
for
thirty
years
cried
madame
trepof
is
it
possible
yes
madame
i
answered
but
you
must
know
the
house
is
situated
on
the
bank
of
the
seine
and
in
the
very
handsomest
and
most
famous
part
of
the
world
from
my
window
i
can
see
the
tuileries
and
the
louvre
the
the
towers
of
the
turrets
of
the
palais
de
justice
and
the
spire
of
the
all
those
stones
speak
to
me
they
tell
me
stories
about
the
days
of
of
the
valois
of
henri
and
of
louis
xiv
i
understand
them
and
i
love
them
all
it
is
only
a
very
small
corner
of
the
world
but
honestly
madame
where
is
there
a
more
glorious
spot
at
this
moment
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
public
square
a
largo
steeped
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
night
madame
trepof
looked
at
me
in
an
uneasy
manner
her
lifted
eyebrows
almost
touched
the
black
curls
about
her
forehead
where
do
you
live
then
she
demanded
brusquely
on
the
quai
malaquais
madame
and
my
name
is
bonnard
it
is
not
a
name
very
widely
known
but
i
am
contented
if
my
friends
do
not
forget
this
revelation
unimportant
as
it
was
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
madame
trepof
she
immediately
turned
her
back
upon
me
and
caught
her
husband
s
arm
come
dimitri
she
exclaimed
do
walk
a
little
faster
i
am
horribly
tired
and
you
will
not
hurry
yourself
in
the
least
we
shall
never
get
home
as
for
you
monsieur
your
way
lies
over
there
she
made
a
vague
gesture
in
the
direction
of
some
dark
vicolo
pushed
her
husband
the
opposite
way
and
called
to
me
without
even
turning
her
head
adieu
monsieur
we
shall
not
go
to
posilippo
nor
the
day
after
either
i
have
a
frightful
headache
dimitri
you
are
unendurable
will
you
not
walk
faster
i
remained
for
the
moment
stupefied
vainly
trying
to
think
what
i
could
have
done
to
offend
madame
trepof
i
had
also
lost
my
way
and
seemed
doomed
to
wander
about
all
night
in
order
to
ask
my
way
i
would
have
to
see
somebody
and
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
i
should
find
a
single
human
being
who
could
understand
me
in
my
despair
i
entered
a
street
at
random
a
street
or
rather
a
horrible
alley
that
had
the
look
of
a
murderous
place
it
proved
so
in
fact
for
i
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
it
before
i
saw
two
men
fighting
with
knives
they
were
attacking
each
other
more
fiercely
with
their
tongues
than
with
their
weapons
and
i
concluded
from
the
nature
of
the
abuse
they
were
showering
upon
each
other
that
it
was
a
love
affair
i
prudently
made
my
way
into
a
side
alley
while
those
two
good
fellows
were
still
much
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
think
about
mine
i
wandered
hopelessly
about
for
a
while
and
at
last
sat
down
completely
discouraged
on
a
stone
bench
inwardly
cursing
the
strange
caprices
of
madame
trepof
how
are
you
signor
are
you
back
from
san
carlo
did
you
hear
the
diva
sing
it
is
only
at
naples
you
can
hear
singing
like
i
looked
up
and
recognised
my
host
i
had
seated
myself
with
my
back
to
the
facade
of
my
hotel
under
the
window
of
my
own
room
november
we
were
all
resting
myself
my
guides
and
their
mules
on
a
road
from
sciacca
to
girgenti
at
a
tavern
in
the
miserable
village
of
whose
inhabitants
consumed
by
the
mal
aria
continually
shiver
in
the
sun
but
nevertheless
they
are
greeks
and
their
gaiety
triumphs
over
all
circumstances
a
few
gather
about
the
tavern
full
of
smiling
curiosity
one
good
story
would
have
sufficed
had
i
known
how
to
tell
it
to
them
to
make
them
forget
all
the
woes
of
life
they
had
all
a
look
of
intelligence
and
their
women
although
tanned
and
faded
wore
their
long
black
cloaks
with
much
grace
before
me
i
could
see
old
ruins
whitened
by
the
ruins
about
which
no
grass
ever
grows
the
dismal
melancholy
of
deserts
prevails
over
this
arid
land
whose
cracked
surface
can
barely
nourish
a
few
shriveled
mimosas
cacti
and
dwarf
palms
twenty
yards
away
along
the
course
of
a
ravine
stones
were
gleaming
whitely
like
a
long
line
of
scattered
bones
they
told
me
that
was
the
bed
of
a
stream
i
had
been
fifteen
days
in
sicily
on
coming
into
the
bay
of
palermo
which
opens
between
the
two
mighty
naked
masses
of
the
pelligrino
and
the
catalfano
and
extends
inward
along
the
golden
conch
the
view
inspired
me
with
such
admiration
that
i
resolved
to
travel
a
little
in
this
island
so
ennobled
by
historic
memories
and
rendered
so
beautiful
by
the
outlines
of
its
hills
which
reveal
the
principles
of
greek
art
old
pilgrim
though
i
was
grown
hoary
in
the
gothic
occident
i
dared
to
venture
upon
that
classic
soil
and
securing
a
guide
i
went
from
palermo
to
trapani
from
trapani
to
selinonte
from
selinonte
to
sciacca
which
i
left
this
morning
to
go
to
girgenti
where
i
am
to
find
the
of
clerk
alexander
the
beautiful
things
i
have
seen
are
still
so
vivid
in
my
mind
that
i
feel
the
task
of
writing
them
would
be
a
useless
fatigue
why
spoil
my
by
collecting
notes
lovers
who
love
truly
do
not
write
down
their
happiness
wholly
absorbed
by
the
melancholy
of
the
present
and
the
poetry
of
the
past
my
thoughts
people
with
beautiful
shapes
and
my
eyes
ever
gratified
by
the
pure
and
harmonious
lines
of
the
landscape
i
was
resting
in
the
tavern
at
sipping
a
glass
of
heavy
fiery
wine
when
i
saw
two
persons
enter
the
whom
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
recognised
as
the
prince
and
princess
trepof
this
time
i
saw
the
princess
in
the
light
and
what
a
light
he
who
has
known
that
of
sicily
can
better
comprehend
the
words
of
sophocles
oh
holy
light
eye
of
the
golden
day
madame
trepof
dressed
in
a
and
wearing
a
straw
hat
appeared
to
me
a
very
pretty
woman
of
about
her
eyes
were
luminous
as
a
child
s
but
her
slightly
plump
chin
indicated
the
age
of
plenitude
she
is
i
must
confess
it
quite
an
attractive
person
she
is
supple
and
changeful
her
mood
is
like
water
itself
and
thank
heaven
i
am
no
navigator
i
thought
i
discerned
in
her
manner
a
sort
of
which
i
attributed
presently
by
reason
of
some
observations
she
uttered
at
random
to
the
fact
that
she
had
met
no
brigands
upon
her
route
such
things
only
happen
to
us
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
discouragement
she
called
for
a
glass
of
iced
water
which
the
landlord
presented
to
her
with
a
gesture
that
recalled
to
me
those
scenes
of
funeral
offerings
painted
upon
greek
vases
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
introduce
myself
to
a
lady
who
had
so
abruptly
dropped
my
acquaintance
in
the
public
square
at
naples
but
she
perceived
me
in
my
corner
and
her
frown
notified
me
very
plainly
that
our
accidental
meeting
was
disagreeable
to
her
after
she
had
sipper
her
for
a
few
moments
whether
because
her
whim
had
suddenly
changed
or
because
my
loneliness
aroused
her
pity
i
did
not
know
she
walked
directly
to
me
monsieur
bonnard
she
said
how
do
you
do
what
strange
chance
enables
us
to
meet
again
in
this
frightful
country
this
country
is
not
frightful
madame
i
replied
beauty
is
so
great
and
so
august
a
quality
that
centuries
of
barbarism
can
not
efface
it
so
completely
that
adorable
vestiges
of
it
will
not
always
remain
the
majesty
of
the
antique
ceres
still
overshadows
these
arid
valleys
and
that
greek
muse
who
made
arethusa
and
maenalus
ring
with
her
divine
accents
still
sings
for
my
ears
upon
the
barren
mountain
and
in
the
place
of
the
spring
yes
madame
when
our
globe
no
longer
inhabited
shall
like
the
moon
roll
a
wan
corpse
through
space
the
soil
which
bears
the
ruins
of
selinonte
will
still
keep
the
seal
of
beauty
in
the
midst
of
universal
death
and
then
then
at
least
there
will
be
no
frivolous
mouth
to
blaspheme
the
grandeur
of
these
i
knew
well
enough
that
my
words
were
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
pretty
little
which
heard
them
but
an
old
fellow
like
myself
who
has
worn
out
his
life
over
books
does
not
know
how
to
adapt
his
tone
to
circumstances
besides
i
wished
to
give
madame
trepof
a
lesson
in
politeness
she
received
it
with
so
much
submission
and
with
such
an
air
of
comprehension
that
i
hastened
to
add
as
as
possible
as
to
whether
the
chance
which
has
enabled
me
to
meet
you
again
be
lucky
or
unlucky
i
can
not
decide
the
question
until
i
am
sure
that
my
presence
be
not
disagreeable
to
you
you
appeared
to
become
weary
of
my
company
very
suddenly
at
naples
the
other
day
i
can
only
attribute
that
misfortune
to
my
naturally
unpleasant
manner
since
on
that
occasion
i
had
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
for
the
first
time
in
my
these
words
seem
to
cause
her
inexplicable
joy
she
smiled
upon
me
in
the
most
gracious
mischievous
way
and
said
very
earnestly
holding
out
her
hand
which
i
touched
with
my
lips
monsieur
bonnard
do
not
refuse
to
accept
a
seat
in
my
carriage
you
can
chat
with
me
on
the
way
about
antiquity
and
that
will
amuse
me
ever
so
my
dear
exclaimed
the
prince
you
can
do
just
as
you
please
but
you
ought
to
remember
that
one
is
horribly
cramped
in
that
carriage
of
yours
and
i
fear
that
you
are
only
offering
monsieur
bonnard
the
chance
of
getting
a
frightful
attack
of
madame
trepof
simply
shook
her
head
by
way
of
explaining
that
such
considerations
had
no
weight
with
her
whatever
then
she
untied
her
hat
the
darkness
of
her
black
curls
descended
over
her
eyes
and
bathed
them
in
velvety
shadow
she
remained
a
little
while
quite
motionless
and
her
face
assumed
a
surprising
expression
of
reverie
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
darted
at
some
oranges
which
the
had
brought
in
a
basket
and
began
to
throw
them
one
by
one
into
a
fold
of
her
dress
these
will
be
nice
on
the
road
she
said
we
are
going
just
where
you
are
going
to
girgenti
i
must
tell
you
all
about
it
you
know
that
my
husband
is
making
a
collection
of
we
bought
thirteen
hundred
at
marseilles
but
we
heard
there
was
a
factory
of
them
at
girgenti
according
to
what
we
were
told
it
is
a
very
small
factory
and
its
products
which
are
very
ugly
never
go
outside
the
city
and
its
suburbs
so
we
are
going
to
girgenti
just
to
buy
dimitri
has
been
a
collector
of
all
sorts
of
things
but
the
only
kind
of
collection
which
can
now
interest
him
is
a
collection
of
he
has
already
got
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
fourteen
different
kinds
some
of
them
gave
us
frightful
trouble
to
find
for
instance
we
knew
that
at
naples
boxes
were
once
made
with
the
portraits
of
mazzini
and
garibaldi
on
them
and
that
the
police
had
seized
the
plates
from
which
the
portraits
were
printed
and
put
the
manufacturer
in
gaol
well
by
dint
of
searching
and
inquiring
for
ever
so
long
a
while
we
found
one
of
those
boxes
at
last
for
sale
at
one
hundred
francs
instead
of
two
sous
it
was
not
really
too
dear
at
that
price
but
we
were
denounced
for
buying
it
we
were
taken
for
conspirators
all
our
baggage
was
searched
they
could
not
find
the
box
because
i
had
hidden
it
so
well
but
they
found
my
jewels
and
carried
them
off
they
have
them
still
the
incident
made
quite
a
sensation
and
we
were
going
to
get
arrested
but
the
king
was
displeased
about
it
and
he
ordered
them
to
leave
us
alone
up
to
that
time
i
used
to
think
it
was
very
stupid
to
collect
but
when
i
found
that
there
were
risks
of
losing
liberty
and
perhaps
even
life
by
doing
it
i
began
to
feel
a
taste
for
it
now
i
am
an
absolute
fanatic
on
the
subject
we
are
going
to
sweden
next
summer
to
complete
our
series
are
we
not
dimitri
i
felt
must
i
confess
it
a
thorough
sympathy
with
these
intrepid
collectors
no
doubt
i
would
rather
have
found
monsieur
and
madame
trepof
engaged
in
collecting
antique
marbles
or
painted
vases
in
sicily
i
should
have
like
to
have
found
them
interested
in
the
ruins
of
syracuse
or
the
poetical
traditions
of
the
eryx
but
at
all
events
they
were
making
some
sort
of
a
collection
they
belonged
to
the
great
confraternity
and
i
could
not
possibly
make
fun
of
them
without
making
fun
of
myself
besides
madame
trepof
had
spoken
of
her
collection
with
such
an
odd
mingling
of
irony
and
enthusiasm
that
i
could
not
help
finding
the
idea
a
very
good
one
we
were
getting
ready
to
leave
the
tavern
when
we
noticed
some
people
coming
downstairs
from
the
upper
room
carrying
carbines
under
their
dark
cloaks
to
me
they
had
the
look
of
thorough
bandits
and
after
they
were
gone
i
told
monsieur
trepof
my
opinion
of
them
he
answered
me
very
quietly
that
he
also
thought
they
were
regular
bandits
and
the
guides
begged
us
to
apply
for
an
escort
of
gendarmes
but
madame
trepof
besought
us
not
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
she
declared
that
we
must
not
spoil
her
then
turning
her
persuasive
eyes
upon
me
she
asked
do
you
not
believe
monsieur
bonnard
that
there
is
nothing
in
life
worth
having
except
sensations
why
certainly
madame
i
answered
but
then
we
must
take
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
sensations
themselves
those
which
a
noble
memory
or
a
grand
spectacle
creates
within
us
certainly
represent
what
is
best
in
human
life
but
those
merely
resulting
from
the
menace
of
danger
seem
to
me
sensations
which
one
should
be
very
careful
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
for
example
would
you
think
it
a
very
pleasant
thing
madame
while
travelling
over
the
mountains
at
midnight
to
find
the
muzzle
of
a
carbine
suddenly
pressed
against
your
forehead
oh
no
she
replied
the
have
made
carbines
absolutely
ridiculous
and
it
would
be
a
great
misfortune
to
any
young
woman
to
find
herself
in
danger
from
an
absurd
weapon
but
it
would
be
quite
different
with
a
knife
a
very
cold
and
very
bright
knife
blade
which
makes
a
cold
shudder
go
right
through
one
s
she
shuddered
even
as
she
spoke
closed
her
eyes
and
threw
her
head
back
then
she
resumed
people
like
you
are
so
happy
you
can
interest
yourselves
in
all
sorts
of
things
she
gave
a
sidelong
look
at
her
husband
who
was
talking
with
the
innkeeper
then
she
leaned
towards
me
and
murmured
very
low
you
see
dimitri
and
i
we
are
both
suffering
from
ennui
we
have
still
the
but
at
last
one
gets
tired
even
of
besides
our
collection
will
soon
be
complete
and
then
what
are
we
going
to
do
oh
madame
i
exclaimed
touched
by
the
moral
unhappiness
of
this
pretty
person
if
you
only
had
a
son
then
you
would
know
what
to
do
you
would
then
learn
the
purpose
of
your
life
and
your
thoughts
would
become
at
once
more
serious
and
yet
more
but
i
have
a
son
she
replied
he
is
a
big
boy
he
is
eleven
years
old
and
he
suffers
from
ennui
like
the
rest
of
us
yes
my
george
has
ennui
too
he
is
tired
of
everything
it
is
very
she
glanced
again
towards
her
husband
who
was
superintending
the
harnessing
of
the
mules
on
the
road
outside
testing
the
condition
of
girths
and
straps
then
she
asked
me
whether
there
had
been
many
changes
on
the
quai
malaquais
during
the
past
ten
years
she
declared
she
never
visited
that
neighbourhood
because
it
was
too
far
way
too
far
from
monte
allegro
i
queried
why
no
she
replied
too
far
from
the
avenue
des
champs
elysees
where
we
and
she
murmured
over
again
as
if
talking
to
herself
too
far
too
far
in
a
tone
of
reverie
which
i
could
not
possibly
account
for
all
at
once
she
smiled
again
and
said
to
me
i
like
you
monsieur
bonnard
i
like
you
very
very
much
the
mules
had
been
harnessed
the
young
woman
hastily
picked
up
a
few
oranges
which
had
rolled
off
her
lap
rose
up
looked
at
me
and
burst
out
laughing
oh
she
exclaimed
how
i
should
like
to
see
you
grappling
with
the
brigands
you
would
say
such
extraordinary
things
to
them
please
take
my
hat
and
hold
my
umbrella
for
me
monsieur
what
a
strange
little
mind
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
followed
her
it
could
only
have
been
in
a
moment
of
inexcusable
thoughtlessness
that
nature
gave
a
child
to
such
a
giddy
little
woman
girgenti
same
day
her
manners
had
shocked
me
i
left
her
to
arrange
herself
in
her
lettica
and
i
made
myself
as
comfortable
as
i
could
in
my
own
these
vehicles
which
have
no
wheels
are
carried
by
two
mules
one
before
and
one
behind
this
kind
of
litter
or
chaise
is
of
ancient
origin
i
had
often
seen
representations
of
similar
ones
in
the
french
mss
of
the
fourteenth
century
i
had
no
idea
then
that
one
of
those
vehicles
would
be
at
a
future
day
placed
at
my
own
disposal
we
must
never
be
too
sure
of
anything
for
three
hours
the
mules
sounded
their
little
bells
and
thumped
the
calcined
ground
with
their
hoofs
on
either
hand
there
slowly
defiled
by
us
the
barren
monstrous
shapes
of
a
nature
totally
african
we
made
a
halt
to
allow
our
animals
to
recover
breath
madame
trepof
came
to
me
on
the
road
took
my
arm
and
drew
me
a
little
away
from
the
party
then
very
suddenly
she
said
to
me
in
a
tone
of
voice
i
had
never
heard
before
do
not
think
that
i
am
a
wicked
woman
my
george
knows
that
i
am
a
good
we
walked
side
by
side
for
a
moment
in
silence
she
looked
up
and
i
saw
that
she
was
crying
madame
i
said
to
her
look
at
this
soil
which
has
been
burned
and
cracked
by
five
long
months
of
fiery
heat
a
little
white
lily
has
sprung
up
from
and
i
pointed
with
my
cane
to
the
frail
stalk
tipped
by
a
double
blossom
your
heart
i
said
however
arid
it
be
bears
also
its
white
lily
and
that
is
reason
enough
why
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
what
you
say
a
wicked
yes
yes
yes
she
cried
with
the
obstinacy
of
a
child
i
am
a
wicked
woman
but
i
am
ashamed
to
appear
so
before
you
who
are
so
good
so
very
very
you
do
not
know
anything
at
all
about
it
i
said
to
her
i
know
it
i
know
all
about
you
monsieur
bonnard
she
declared
with
a
smile
and
she
jumped
back
into
her
lettica
girgenti
november
i
awoke
the
following
morning
in
the
house
of
gellias
gellias
was
a
rich
citizen
of
ancient
agrigentum
he
was
equally
celebrated
for
his
generosity
and
for
his
wealth
and
he
endowed
his
native
city
with
a
great
number
of
free
inns
gellias
has
been
dead
for
thirteen
hundred
years
and
nowadays
there
is
no
gratuitous
hospitality
among
civilised
peoples
but
the
name
of
gellias
has
become
that
of
a
hotel
in
which
by
reason
of
fatigue
i
was
able
to
obtain
one
good
night
s
sleep
the
modern
girgenti
lifts
its
high
narrow
solid
streets
dominated
by
a
sombre
spanish
cathedral
upon
the
side
of
the
acropolis
of
the
antique
agrigentum
i
can
see
from
my
windows
on
the
hillside
towards
the
sea
the
white
range
of
temples
partially
destroyed
the
ruins
alone
have
some
aspect
of
coolness
all
the
rest
is
arid
water
and
life
have
forsaken
agrigentine
water
the
divine
nestis
of
the
agrigentine
empedocles
is
so
necessary
to
animated
beings
that
nothing
can
live
far
from
the
rivers
and
the
springs
but
the
port
of
girgenti
situated
at
a
distance
of
three
kilometres
from
the
city
has
a
great
commerce
and
it
is
in
this
dismal
city
i
said
to
myself
upon
this
precipitous
rock
that
the
manuscript
of
clerk
alexander
is
to
be
found
i
asked
my
way
to
the
house
of
signor
polizzi
and
proceeded
thither
i
found
signor
polizzi
dressed
all
in
white
from
head
to
feet
busy
cooking
sausages
in
a
at
the
sight
of
me
he
let
go
the
threw
up
his
arms
in
the
air
and
uttered
shrieks
of
enthusiasm
he
was
a
little
man
whose
pimply
features
aquiline
nose
round
eyes
and
projecting
chin
formed
a
very
expressive
physiognomy
he
called
me
excellence
said
he
was
going
to
mark
the
day
with
a
white
stone
and
made
me
sit
down
the
hall
in
which
we
were
represented
the
union
of
the
kitchen
bedchamber
studio
and
there
were
charcoal
furnaces
visible
a
bed
paintings
an
easel
bottles
strings
of
onions
and
a
magnificent
lustre
of
coloured
glass
pendants
i
glanced
at
the
paintings
on
the
wall
the
arts
the
arts
cried
signor
polizzi
throwing
up
his
arms
again
to
heaven
the
arts
what
dignity
what
consolation
excellence
i
am
a
painter
and
he
showed
me
an
unfinished
which
indeed
could
very
well
remain
unfinished
for
ever
without
any
loss
to
religion
or
to
art
next
he
showed
me
some
old
paintings
of
a
better
style
but
apparently
restored
after
a
decidedly
reckless
manner
i
repair
he
said
i
repair
old
paintings
oh
the
old
masters
what
genius
what
soul
why
then
i
said
to
him
you
must
be
a
painter
an
archaeologist
and
a
all
in
one
at
your
service
excellence
he
answered
i
have
a
zucco
here
at
this
very
moment
a
zucco
of
which
every
single
drop
is
a
pearl
of
fire
i
want
your
lordship
to
taste
of
i
esteem
the
wines
of
sicily
i
responded
but
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
your
flagons
that
i
came
to
see
you
signor
he
then
you
have
come
to
see
me
about
paintings
you
are
an
amateur
it
is
an
immense
delight
for
me
to
receive
amateurs
i
am
going
to
show
you
the
oeuvre
of
monrealese
yes
excellence
his
oeuvre
an
adoration
of
shepherds
it
is
the
pearl
of
the
whole
sicilian
school
i
later
on
i
will
be
glad
to
see
the
oeuvre
but
let
us
first
talk
about
the
business
which
brings
me
his
little
quick
bright
eyes
watched
my
face
curiously
and
i
perceived
with
anguish
that
he
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
purpose
of
my
visit
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
over
my
forehead
and
in
the
bewilderment
of
my
anxiety
i
stammered
out
something
to
this
effect
i
have
come
from
paris
expressly
to
look
at
a
manuscript
of
the
legende
doree
which
you
informed
me
was
in
your
at
these
words
he
threw
up
his
arms
opened
his
mouth
and
eyes
to
the
widest
possible
extent
and
betrayed
every
sign
of
extreme
nervousness
oh
the
manuscript
of
the
golden
legend
a
pearl
excellence
a
ruby
a
diamond
two
miniatures
so
perfect
that
they
give
one
the
feeling
of
glimpses
of
paradise
what
suavity
those
colours
ravished
from
the
corollas
of
flowers
make
a
honey
for
the
eyes
even
a
sicilian
could
have
done
no
better
let
me
see
it
then
i
asked
unable
to
conceal
either
my
anxiety
or
my
hope
let
you
see
it
cried
polizzi
but
how
can
i
excellence
i
have
not
got
it
any
longer
i
have
not
got
it
and
he
seemed
determined
to
tear
out
his
hair
he
might
indeed
have
pulled
every
hair
in
his
head
out
of
his
hide
before
i
should
have
tried
to
prevent
him
but
he
stopped
of
his
own
accord
before
he
had
done
himself
any
grievous
harm
what
i
cried
out
in
anger
what
you
make
me
come
all
the
way
from
paris
to
girgenti
by
promising
to
show
me
a
manuscript
and
now
when
i
come
you
tell
me
you
have
not
got
it
it
is
simply
infamous
monsieur
i
shall
leave
your
conduct
to
be
judged
by
all
honest
men
anybody
who
could
have
seen
me
at
that
moment
would
have
been
able
to
form
a
good
idea
of
the
aspect
of
a
furious
sheep
it
is
infamous
it
is
infamous
i
repeated
waving
my
arms
which
trembled
from
anger
then
polizzi
let
himself
fall
into
a
chair
in
the
attitude
of
a
dying
hero
i
saw
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
his
hair
until
then
flamboyant
and
erect
upon
his
head
fall
down
in
limp
disorder
over
his
brow
i
am
a
father
excellence
i
am
a
father
he
groaned
wringing
his
hands
he
continued
sobbing
my
son
rafael
the
son
of
my
poor
wife
for
whose
death
i
have
been
mourning
fifteen
years
rafael
excellence
wanted
to
settle
at
paris
he
hired
a
shop
in
the
rue
lafitte
for
the
sale
of
curiosities
i
gave
him
everything
precious
which
i
had
i
gave
him
my
finest
majolicas
my
most
beautiful
urbino
ware
my
masterpieces
of
art
what
paintings
signor
even
now
they
dazzle
me
with
i
see
them
only
in
imagination
and
all
of
them
signed
finally
i
gave
him
the
manuscript
of
the
golden
legend
i
would
have
given
him
my
flesh
and
my
blood
an
only
son
signor
the
son
of
my
poor
saintly
wife
so
i
said
while
i
relying
on
your
written
word
monsieur
was
travelling
to
the
very
heart
of
sicily
to
find
the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
the
same
manuscript
was
actually
exposed
for
sale
in
a
window
in
the
rue
lafitte
only
fifteen
hundred
yards
from
my
house
yes
it
was
there
that
is
positively
true
exclaimed
signor
polizzi
suddenly
growing
calm
again
and
it
is
there
still
at
least
i
hope
it
is
he
took
a
card
from
a
shelf
as
he
spoke
and
offered
it
to
me
saying
here
is
the
address
of
my
son
make
it
known
to
your
friends
and
you
will
oblige
me
faience
and
enameled
wares
hangings
pictures
he
has
a
complete
stock
of
objects
of
art
all
at
the
fairest
possible
prices
and
everything
authentic
i
can
vouch
for
it
upon
my
honour
go
and
see
him
he
will
show
you
the
manuscript
of
the
golden
two
miniatures
miraculously
fresh
in
colour
i
was
feeble
enough
to
take
the
card
he
held
out
to
me
the
fellow
was
taking
further
advantage
of
my
weakness
to
make
me
circulate
the
name
of
rafael
polizzi
among
the
societies
of
the
learned
my
hand
was
already
on
the
when
the
sicilian
caught
me
by
the
arm
he
had
a
look
as
of
sudden
inspiration
ah
excellence
he
cried
what
a
city
is
this
city
of
ours
it
gave
birth
to
empedocles
empedocles
what
a
great
man
what
a
great
citizen
what
audacity
of
thought
what
virtue
what
soul
at
the
port
over
there
is
a
statue
of
empedocles
before
which
i
bare
my
head
each
time
that
i
pass
by
when
rafael
my
son
was
going
away
to
found
an
establishment
of
antiquities
in
the
rue
lafitte
at
paris
i
took
him
to
the
port
and
there
at
the
foot
of
that
statue
of
empedocles
i
bestowed
upon
him
my
paternal
benediction
always
remember
empedocles
i
said
to
him
ah
signor
what
our
unhappy
country
needs
is
a
new
empedocles
would
you
not
like
me
to
show
you
the
way
to
his
statue
excellence
i
will
be
your
guide
among
the
ruins
here
i
will
show
you
the
temple
of
castor
and
pollux
the
temple
of
the
olympian
jupiter
the
temple
of
the
lucinian
juno
the
antique
well
the
tomb
of
theron
and
the
gate
of
gold
all
the
professional
guides
are
asses
but
we
we
shall
make
excavations
if
you
are
willing
and
we
shall
discover
treasures
i
know
the
science
of
discovering
hidden
treasures
the
secret
art
of
finding
their
whereabouts
a
gift
from
heaven
i
succeeded
in
tearing
myself
away
from
his
grasp
but
he
ran
after
me
again
stopped
me
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
said
in
my
ear
listen
excellence
i
will
conduct
you
about
the
city
i
will
introduce
you
to
some
girgentines
what
a
race
what
types
what
forms
sicilian
girls
signor
the
antique
beauty
itself
go
to
the
devil
i
cried
at
last
in
anger
and
rushed
into
the
street
leaving
him
still
writhing
in
the
loftiness
of
his
enthusiasm
when
i
had
got
out
of
his
sight
i
sank
down
upon
a
stone
and
began
to
think
with
my
face
in
my
hands
and
it
was
for
this
i
said
to
myself
it
was
to
hear
such
propositions
as
this
that
i
came
to
sicily
that
polizzi
is
simply
a
scoundrel
and
his
son
another
and
they
made
a
plan
together
to
ruin
but
what
was
their
scheme
i
could
not
unravel
it
meanwhile
it
may
be
imagined
how
discouraged
and
humiliated
i
felt
a
merry
burst
of
laughter
caused
me
to
turn
my
head
and
i
saw
madame
trepof
running
in
advance
of
her
husband
and
holding
up
something
which
i
could
not
distinguish
clearly
she
sat
down
beside
me
and
showed
me
laughing
more
merrily
all
the
while
an
abominable
little
box
on
which
was
printed
a
red
and
blue
face
which
the
inscription
declared
to
be
the
face
of
empedocles
yes
madame
i
said
but
that
abominable
polizzi
to
whom
i
advise
you
not
to
send
monsieur
trepof
has
made
me
fall
out
for
ever
with
empedocles
and
this
portrait
is
not
at
all
of
a
nature
to
make
me
feel
more
kindly
to
the
ancient
oh
declared
madame
trepof
it
is
ugly
but
it
is
rare
these
boxes
are
not
exported
at
all
you
can
buy
them
only
where
they
are
made
dimitri
has
six
others
just
like
this
in
his
pocket
we
got
them
so
as
to
exchange
with
other
collectors
you
understand
at
none
o
clock
this
morning
we
were
at
the
factory
you
see
we
did
not
waste
our
so
i
certainly
perceive
madame
i
replied
bitterly
but
i
have
lost
i
then
saw
that
she
was
a
naturally
woman
all
her
merriment
vanished
poor
monsieur
bonnard
poor
monsieur
bonnard
she
murmured
and
taking
my
hand
in
hers
she
added
tell
me
about
your
i
told
her
about
them
my
story
was
long
but
she
was
evidently
touched
by
it
for
she
asked
me
quite
a
number
of
circumstantial
questions
which
i
took
for
proof
of
her
friendly
interest
she
wanted
to
know
the
exact
title
of
the
manuscript
its
shape
its
appearance
and
its
age
she
asked
me
for
the
address
of
signor
rafael
polizzi
and
i
gave
it
to
her
thus
doing
o
destiny
precisely
what
the
abominable
polizzi
had
told
me
to
do
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
check
oneself
i
recommenced
my
plaints
and
my
imprecations
but
this
time
madame
trepof
only
burst
out
laughing
why
do
you
laugh
i
asked
her
because
i
am
a
wicked
woman
she
answered
and
she
fled
away
leaving
me
all
disheartened
on
my
stone
paris
december
my
unpacked
trunks
still
encumbered
the
hall
i
was
seated
at
a
tabled
covered
with
all
those
good
things
which
the
land
of
france
produces
for
the
delectation
of
gourmets
i
was
eating
a
pate
le
chartres
which
is
alone
sufficient
to
make
one
love
one
s
country
therese
standing
before
me
with
her
hands
joined
over
her
white
apron
was
looking
at
me
with
benignity
with
anxiety
and
with
pity
hamilcar
was
rubbing
himself
against
my
legs
wild
with
delight
these
words
of
an
old
poet
came
back
to
my
memory
happy
is
he
who
like
ulysses
hath
made
a
goodly
well
i
thought
to
myself
i
travelled
to
no
purpose
i
have
come
back
with
empty
hands
but
like
ulysses
i
made
a
goodly
and
having
taken
my
last
sip
of
coffee
i
asked
therese
for
my
hat
and
cane
which
she
gave
me
not
without
dire
suspicions
she
feared
i
might
be
going
upon
another
journey
but
i
reassured
her
by
telling
her
to
have
dinner
ready
at
six
o
clock
it
had
always
been
a
keen
pleasure
for
me
to
breathe
the
air
in
those
parisian
streets
whose
every
and
every
stone
i
love
devotedly
but
i
had
an
end
in
view
and
i
took
my
way
straight
to
the
rue
lafitte
i
was
not
long
in
find
the
establishment
of
signor
rafael
polizzi
it
was
distinguishable
by
a
great
display
of
old
paintings
which
although
all
bearing
the
signature
of
some
illustrious
artist
had
a
certain
family
air
of
resemblance
that
might
have
suggested
some
touching
idea
about
the
fraternity
of
genius
had
it
not
still
more
forcibly
suggested
the
professional
tricks
of
polizzi
senior
enriched
by
these
doubtful
works
of
art
the
shop
was
further
rendered
attractive
by
various
petty
curiosities
poniards
goblets
figulines
brass
guadrons
and
wares
of
metallic
lustre
upon
a
portuguese
decorated
with
an
escutcheon
lay
a
copy
of
the
heures
of
simon
vostre
open
at
the
page
which
has
an
astrological
figure
on
it
and
an
old
vitruvius
placed
upon
a
quaint
chest
displayed
its
masterly
engravings
of
caryatides
and
telamones
this
apparent
disorder
which
only
masked
cunning
arrangement
this
factitious
hazard
which
had
placed
the
best
objects
in
the
most
favourable
light
would
have
increased
my
distrust
of
the
place
but
that
the
distrust
which
the
mere
name
of
polizzi
had
already
inspired
could
not
have
been
increased
by
any
circumstances
being
already
infinite
signor
rafael
who
sat
there
as
the
presiding
genius
of
all
these
vague
and
incongruous
shapes
impressed
me
as
a
phlegmatic
young
man
with
a
sort
of
english
character
he
betrayed
no
sign
whatever
of
those
transcendent
faculties
displayed
by
his
father
in
the
arts
of
mimicry
and
declamation
i
told
him
what
i
had
come
for
he
opened
a
cabinet
and
drew
from
it
a
manuscript
which
he
placed
on
a
table
that
i
might
examine
it
at
my
leisure
never
in
my
life
did
i
experience
such
an
emotion
except
indeed
during
some
few
brief
months
of
my
youth
months
whose
memories
though
i
should
live
a
hundred
years
would
remain
as
fresh
at
my
last
hour
as
in
the
first
day
they
came
to
me
it
was
indeed
the
very
manuscript
described
by
the
librarian
of
sir
thomas
raleigh
it
was
indeed
the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
which
i
saw
which
i
touched
the
work
of
voragine
himself
had
been
perceptibly
abridged
but
that
made
little
difference
to
me
all
the
inestimable
additions
of
the
monk
of
were
there
that
was
the
main
point
i
tried
to
read
the
legend
of
saint
droctoveus
but
i
could
not
all
the
lines
of
the
page
quivered
before
my
eyes
and
there
was
a
sound
in
my
ears
like
the
noise
of
a
windmill
in
the
country
at
night
nevertheless
i
was
able
to
see
that
the
manuscript
offered
every
evidence
of
indubitable
authenticity
the
two
drawings
of
the
purification
of
the
virgin
and
the
coronation
of
proserpine
were
meagre
in
design
and
vulgar
in
violence
of
colouring
considerably
damaged
in
as
attested
by
the
catalogue
of
sir
thomas
they
had
obtained
during
the
interval
a
new
aspect
of
freshness
but
this
miracle
did
not
surprise
me
at
all
and
besides
what
did
i
care
about
the
two
miniatures
the
legends
and
the
poem
of
alexander
those
alone
formed
the
treasure
i
desired
my
eyes
devoured
as
much
of
it
as
they
had
the
power
to
absorb
i
affected
indifference
while
asking
signor
polizzi
the
price
of
the
manuscript
and
while
awaiting
his
reply
i
offered
up
a
secret
prayer
that
the
price
might
not
exceed
the
amount
of
ready
money
at
my
disposal
already
much
diminished
by
the
cost
of
my
expensive
voyage
signor
polizzi
however
informed
me
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
the
article
inasmuch
as
it
did
not
belong
to
him
and
was
to
be
sold
at
auction
shortly
at
the
hotel
des
ventes
with
a
number
of
other
mss
and
several
incunabula
this
was
a
severe
blow
to
me
it
tried
to
preserve
my
calmness
notwithstanding
and
replied
somewhat
to
this
effect
you
surprise
me
monsieur
your
father
whom
i
talked
with
recently
at
girgenti
told
me
positively
that
the
manuscript
was
yours
you
can
not
now
attempt
to
make
me
discredit
your
father
s
i
did
own
the
manuscript
indeed
answered
signor
rafael
with
absolute
frankness
but
i
do
not
own
it
any
longer
i
sold
that
manuscript
the
remarkable
interest
of
which
you
have
not
failed
to
perceive
to
an
amateur
whom
i
am
forbidden
to
name
and
who
for
reasons
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
mention
finds
himself
obliged
to
sell
his
collection
i
am
honoured
with
the
confidence
of
my
customer
and
was
commissioned
by
him
to
draw
up
the
catalogue
and
manage
the
sale
which
takes
place
the
of
december
now
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
your
address
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
the
catalogue
which
is
already
in
the
press
you
fill
find
the
legende
doree
described
in
it
as
no
i
gave
my
address
and
left
the
shop
the
polite
gravity
of
the
son
impressed
me
quite
as
disagreeably
as
the
impudent
buffoonery
of
the
father
i
hated
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
the
tricks
of
the
vile
hagglers
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
two
rascals
had
a
secret
understanding
and
had
only
devised
this
with
the
aid
of
a
professional
appraiser
to
force
the
bidding
on
the
manuscript
i
wanted
so
much
up
to
an
outrageous
figure
i
was
completely
at
their
mercy
there
is
one
evil
in
all
passionate
desires
even
the
noblest
namely
that
they
leave
us
subject
to
the
will
of
others
and
in
so
far
dependent
this
reflection
made
me
suffer
cruelly
but
it
did
not
conquer
my
longing
to
won
the
work
of
clerk
alexander
while
i
was
thus
meditating
i
heard
a
coachman
swear
and
i
discovered
it
was
i
whom
he
was
swearing
at
only
when
i
felt
the
pole
of
a
carriage
poke
me
in
the
ribs
i
started
aside
barely
in
time
to
save
myself
from
being
run
over
and
whom
did
i
perceive
through
the
windows
of
the
coupe
madame
trepof
being
taken
by
two
beautiful
horses
and
a
coachman
all
wrapped
up
in
furs
like
a
russian
boyard
into
the
very
street
i
had
just
left
she
did
not
notice
me
she
was
laughing
to
herself
with
that
artless
grace
of
expression
which
still
preserved
for
her
at
thirty
years
all
the
charm
of
her
early
youth
well
well
i
said
to
myself
she
is
laughing
i
suppose
she
must
have
just
found
another
and
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
ponts
feeling
very
miserable
nature
eternally
indifferent
neither
hastened
nor
hurried
the
day
of
december
i
went
to
the
hotel
bullion
and
took
my
place
in
salle
no
immediately
below
the
high
desk
at
which
the
auctioneer
boulouze
and
the
expert
polizzi
were
to
sit
i
saw
the
hall
gradually
fill
with
familiar
faces
i
shook
hands
with
several
old
booksellers
of
the
quays
but
that
prudence
which
any
large
interest
inspires
in
even
the
most
caused
me
to
keep
silence
in
regard
to
the
reason
of
my
unaccustomed
presence
in
the
halls
of
the
hotel
bullion
on
the
other
hand
i
questioned
those
gentlemen
at
the
auction
sale
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
them
all
interested
about
matters
in
no
wise
related
to
my
affair
little
by
little
the
hall
became
thronged
with
interested
or
merely
curious
spectators
and
after
half
an
hour
s
delay
the
auctioneer
with
his
ivory
hammer
the
clerk
with
his
bundle
of
and
the
crier
carrying
his
fixed
to
the
end
of
a
pole
all
took
their
places
on
the
platform
in
the
most
solemn
business
manner
the
attendants
ranged
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
desk
the
presiding
officer
having
declared
the
sale
open
a
partial
hush
followed
a
commonplace
series
of
preces
dia
with
miniatures
were
first
sold
off
at
mediocre
prices
needless
to
say
the
illuminations
of
these
books
were
in
perfect
condition
the
lowness
of
the
bids
gave
courage
to
the
gathering
of
booksellers
present
who
began
to
mingle
with
us
and
become
more
familiar
the
dealers
in
old
brass
and
pressed
forward
in
their
tun
waiting
for
the
doors
of
an
adjoining
room
to
be
opened
and
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
was
drowned
by
the
jests
of
the
auvergnats
a
magnificent
codex
of
the
guerre
des
juifs
revived
attention
it
was
long
disputed
for
five
thousand
francs
five
thousand
called
the
crier
while
the
dealers
remained
silent
with
admiration
then
seven
or
eight
antiphonaries
brought
us
back
again
to
low
prices
a
fat
old
woman
in
a
loose
gown
bareheaded
a
dealer
in
goods
encouraged
by
the
size
of
the
books
and
the
low
prices
bidden
had
one
of
the
antiphonaries
knocked
down
to
her
for
thirty
francs
at
last
the
expert
polizzi
announced
no
the
golden
legend
french
unpublished
two
superb
miniatures
with
a
starting
bid
of
three
thousand
three
thousand
three
thousand
bid
yelled
the
crier
three
thousand
dryly
repeated
the
auctioneer
there
was
a
buzzing
in
my
head
and
as
through
a
cloud
i
saw
a
host
of
curious
faces
all
turning
towards
the
manuscript
which
a
boy
was
carrying
open
through
the
audience
three
thousand
and
fifty
i
said
i
was
frightened
by
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
and
further
confused
by
seeing
or
thinking
that
i
saw
all
eyes
turned
on
me
three
thousand
and
fifty
on
the
right
called
the
crier
taking
up
my
bid
three
thousand
one
hundred
responded
signor
polizzi
then
began
a
heroic
duel
between
the
expert
and
myself
three
thousand
five
hundred
six
hundred
seven
hundred
four
thousand
four
thousand
five
then
by
a
sudden
bold
stroke
signor
polizzi
raised
the
bid
at
once
to
six
thousand
six
thousand
francs
was
all
the
money
i
could
dispose
of
it
represented
the
possible
i
risked
the
impossible
six
thousand
one
hundred
alas
even
the
impossible
did
not
suffice
six
thousand
five
hundred
replied
signor
polizzi
with
calm
i
bowed
my
head
and
sat
there
stupefied
unable
to
answer
either
yes
or
no
to
the
crier
who
called
to
me
six
thousand
five
hundred
by
me
not
by
you
on
the
right
there
it
is
my
bid
no
mistake
six
thousand
five
hundred
perfectly
understood
declared
the
auctioneer
six
thousand
five
hundred
perfectly
clear
perfectly
plain
any
more
bids
the
last
bid
is
six
thousand
five
hundred
a
solemn
silence
prevailed
suddenly
i
felt
as
if
my
head
had
burst
open
it
was
the
hammer
of
the
officiant
who
with
a
loud
blow
on
the
platform
adjudged
no
irrevocably
to
signor
polizzi
forthwith
the
pen
of
the
clerk
coursing
over
the
registered
that
great
fact
in
a
single
line
i
was
absolutely
prostrated
and
i
felt
the
utmost
need
of
rest
and
quiet
nevertheless
i
did
not
leave
my
seat
my
powers
of
reflection
slowly
returned
hope
is
tenacious
i
had
one
more
hope
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
new
owner
of
the
legende
doree
might
be
some
intelligent
and
liberal
bibliophile
who
would
allow
me
to
examine
the
and
perhaps
even
to
publish
the
more
important
parts
and
with
this
idea
as
soon
as
the
sale
was
over
i
approached
the
expert
as
he
was
leaving
the
platform
monsieur
i
asked
him
did
you
buy
in
no
on
your
own
account
or
on
commission
on
commission
i
was
instructed
not
to
let
it
go
at
any
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
purchaser
monsieur
i
regret
that
i
can
not
serve
you
in
that
respect
i
have
been
strictly
forbidden
to
mention
the
i
went
home
in
despair
december
therese
don
t
you
hear
the
bell
somebody
has
been
ringing
at
the
door
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
therese
does
not
answer
she
is
chattering
downstairs
with
the
concierge
for
sure
so
that
is
the
way
you
observe
your
old
master
s
birthday
you
desert
me
even
on
the
eve
of
alas
if
i
am
to
hear
any
kind
wishes
they
must
come
up
from
the
ground
for
all
who
love
me
have
long
been
buried
i
really
don
t
know
what
i
am
still
living
for
there
is
the
bell
again
i
get
up
slowly
from
my
seat
at
the
fire
with
my
shoulders
still
bent
from
stooping
over
it
and
go
to
the
door
myself
whom
do
i
see
at
the
threshold
it
is
not
a
dripping
love
and
i
am
not
an
old
anacreon
but
it
is
a
very
pretty
little
boy
of
about
ten
years
old
he
is
alone
he
raises
his
face
to
look
at
me
his
cheeks
are
blushing
but
his
little
pert
nose
gives
one
an
idea
of
mischievous
pleasantry
he
has
feathers
in
his
cap
and
a
great
on
his
jacket
the
pretty
little
fellow
he
holds
in
both
arms
a
bundle
as
big
as
himself
and
asks
me
if
i
am
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
i
tell
him
yes
he
gives
me
the
bundle
tells
me
his
mamma
sent
it
to
me
and
then
he
runs
downstairs
i
go
down
a
few
steps
i
lean
over
the
balustrade
and
see
the
little
cap
whirling
down
the
spiral
of
the
stairway
like
a
feather
in
the
wind
my
little
boy
i
should
have
liked
so
much
to
question
him
but
what
after
all
could
i
have
asked
it
is
not
polite
to
question
children
besides
the
package
itself
will
probably
give
me
more
information
than
the
messenger
could
it
is
a
very
big
bundle
but
not
very
heavy
i
take
it
into
my
library
and
there
untie
the
ribbons
and
unfasten
the
paper
wrappings
and
i
see
what
a
log
a
log
a
real
christmas
log
but
so
light
that
i
know
it
must
be
hollow
then
i
find
that
it
is
indeed
composed
of
two
separate
pieces
opening
on
hinges
and
fastened
with
hooks
i
slip
the
hooks
back
and
find
myself
inundated
with
violets
violets
they
pour
over
my
table
over
my
knees
over
the
carpet
they
tumble
into
my
vest
into
my
sleeves
i
am
all
perfumed
with
them
therese
therese
fill
me
some
vases
with
water
and
bring
them
here
quick
here
are
violets
sent
to
us
i
know
not
from
what
country
nor
by
what
hand
but
it
must
be
from
a
perfumed
country
and
by
a
very
gracious
hand
do
you
hear
me
old
crow
i
have
put
all
the
violets
on
my
table
now
completely
covered
by
the
odorous
mass
but
there
is
still
something
in
the
log
a
book
a
manuscript
it
is
i
can
not
believe
it
and
yet
i
can
not
doubt
it
it
is
the
legende
doree
it
is
the
manuscript
of
the
clerk
alexander
here
is
the
purification
of
the
virgin
and
the
coronation
of
proserpine
here
is
the
legend
of
saint
droctoveus
i
contemplate
this
relic
i
turn
the
leaves
of
it
between
which
the
dark
rich
blossoms
have
slipped
in
here
and
there
and
right
opposite
the
legend
of
i
find
a
card
bearing
this
name
princess
princess
trepof
you
who
laughed
and
wept
by
turns
so
sweetly
under
the
fair
sky
of
agrigentum
you
whom
a
cross
old
man
believed
to
be
only
a
foolish
little
woman
i
am
convinced
of
your
rare
and
beautiful
folly
and
the
old
fellow
whom
you
now
overwhelm
with
happiness
will
go
to
kiss
your
hand
and
give
you
back
in
another
form
this
precious
manuscript
of
which
both
he
and
science
owe
you
an
exact
and
sumptuous
publication
therese
entered
my
study
just
at
that
moment
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
excited
monsieur
she
cried
guess
whom
i
saw
just
now
in
a
carriage
with
a
painted
on
it
that
was
stopping
before
the
door
parbleu
madame
trepof
i
exclaimed
i
don
t
know
anything
about
any
madame
trepof
answered
my
housekeeper
the
woman
i
saw
just
now
was
dressed
like
a
duchess
and
had
a
little
boy
with
her
with
all
along
the
seams
of
his
clothes
and
it
was
that
same
little
madame
coccoz
you
once
sent
a
log
to
when
she
was
here
about
eleven
years
ago
i
recognized
her
at
what
i
exclaimed
you
mean
to
say
it
was
madame
coccoz
the
widow
of
the
herself
monsieur
the
was
open
for
a
minute
to
let
her
little
boy
who
had
just
come
from
i
don
t
know
where
get
in
she
hasn
t
changed
scarcely
at
all
well
why
should
those
women
change
they
never
worry
themselves
about
anything
only
the
coccoz
woman
looks
a
little
fatter
than
she
used
to
be
and
the
idea
of
a
woman
that
was
taken
in
here
out
of
pure
charity
coming
to
show
off
her
velvets
and
diamonds
in
a
carriage
with
a
crest
painted
on
it
isn
t
it
shameful
therese
i
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
if
you
ever
speak
to
me
again
about
that
lady
except
in
terms
of
the
deepest
respect
you
and
i
will
fall
out
bring
me
the
sevres
vases
to
put
those
violets
in
which
now
give
the
city
of
books
a
charm
it
never
had
while
therese
went
off
with
a
sigh
to
get
the
sevres
vases
i
continued
to
contemplate
those
beautiful
scattered
violets
whose
odour
spread
all
about
me
like
the
perfume
of
some
sweet
presence
some
charming
soul
and
i
asked
myself
how
it
had
been
possible
for
me
never
to
recognise
madame
coccoz
in
the
person
of
the
princess
trepof
but
that
vision
of
the
young
widow
showing
me
her
little
child
on
the
stairs
had
been
a
very
rapid
one
i
had
much
more
reason
to
reproach
myself
for
having
passed
by
a
gracious
and
lovely
soul
without
knowing
it
bonnard
i
said
to
myself
thou
knowest
how
to
decipher
old
texts
but
thou
dost
not
know
how
to
read
in
the
book
of
life
that
giddy
little
madame
trepof
whom
thou
once
believed
to
possess
no
more
soul
than
a
bird
has
expended
in
pure
gratitude
more
zeal
and
finer
tact
than
thou
didst
ever
show
for
anybody
s
sake
right
royally
hath
she
repaid
thee
for
the
of
her
therese
awhile
ago
you
were
a
magpie
now
you
are
becoming
a
tortoise
come
and
give
some
water
to
these
parmese
part
ii
the
daughter
of
clementine
chapter
i
the
fairy
when
i
left
the
train
at
the
melun
station
night
had
already
spread
its
peace
over
the
silent
country
the
soil
heated
through
all
the
long
day
by
a
strong
sun
by
a
gros
soleil
as
the
harvesters
of
the
val
de
vire
say
still
exhaled
a
warm
heavy
smell
lush
dense
odours
of
grass
passed
over
the
level
of
the
fields
i
brushed
away
the
dust
of
the
railway
carriage
and
joyfully
inhaled
the
pure
air
my
filled
by
my
housekeeper
wit
linen
and
various
small
toilet
articles
munditiis
seemed
so
light
in
my
hand
that
i
swung
it
about
just
as
a
schoolboy
swings
his
strapped
package
of
rudimentary
books
when
the
class
is
let
out
would
to
heaven
that
i
were
again
a
little
urchin
at
school
but
it
is
fully
fifty
years
since
my
good
dead
mother
made
me
some
tartines
of
bread
and
preserves
and
placed
them
in
a
basket
of
which
she
slipped
the
handle
over
my
arm
and
then
led
me
thus
prepared
to
the
school
kept
by
monsieur
douloir
at
a
corner
of
the
passage
du
commerce
well
known
to
the
sparrows
between
a
court
and
a
garden
the
enormous
monsieur
douloir
smiled
upon
us
genially
and
patted
my
cheek
to
show
no
doubt
the
affectionate
interest
which
my
first
appearance
had
inspired
but
when
my
mother
had
passed
out
of
the
court
startling
the
sparrows
as
she
went
monsieur
douloir
ceased
to
smile
he
showed
no
more
affectionate
interest
he
appeared
on
the
contrary
to
consider
me
as
a
very
troublesome
little
fellow
i
discovered
later
on
that
he
entertained
the
same
feelings
towards
all
his
pupils
he
distributed
whacks
of
his
ferule
with
an
agility
no
one
could
have
expected
on
the
part
of
so
corpulent
a
person
but
his
first
aspect
of
tender
interest
invariably
reappeared
when
he
spoke
to
any
of
our
mothers
in
our
presence
and
always
at
such
times
while
warmly
praising
our
remarkable
aptitudes
he
would
cast
down
upon
us
a
look
of
intense
affection
still
those
were
happy
days
which
i
passed
on
the
benches
of
the
monsieur
couloir
with
my
little
playfellows
who
like
myself
cried
and
laughed
by
turns
with
all
their
might
from
morning
till
evening
after
a
whole
these
souvenirs
float
up
again
fresh
and
bright
as
ever
to
the
surface
of
memory
under
this
starry
sky
whose
face
has
in
no
wise
changed
since
then
and
whose
serene
and
immutable
lights
will
doubtless
see
many
other
schoolboys
such
as
i
was
slowly
turn
into
servants
afflicted
with
catarrh
stars
who
have
shown
down
upon
each
wise
or
foolish
head
among
all
my
forgotten
ancestors
it
is
under
your
soft
light
that
i
now
feel
stir
within
me
a
certain
poignant
regret
i
would
that
i
could
have
a
son
who
might
be
able
to
see
you
when
i
shall
see
you
no
more
how
i
should
love
him
ah
such
a
son
would
what
am
i
saying
why
he
would
be
no
just
twenty
years
old
if
you
had
only
been
willing
clementine
you
whose
cheeks
used
to
look
so
ruddy
under
your
pink
hood
but
you
are
married
to
that
young
bank
clerk
noel
alexandre
who
made
so
many
millions
afterwards
i
never
met
you
again
after
your
marriage
clementine
but
i
can
see
you
now
with
your
bright
curls
and
your
pink
hood
a
a
a
really
it
would
be
curious
to
see
what
i
look
like
now
with
my
white
hair
sighing
clementine
s
name
to
the
stars
still
it
is
not
right
to
end
with
sterile
irony
the
thought
begun
in
the
spirit
of
faith
and
love
no
clementine
if
your
name
came
to
my
lips
by
chance
this
beautiful
night
be
it
for
ever
blessed
your
dear
name
and
may
you
ever
as
a
happy
mother
a
happy
grandmother
enjoy
to
the
very
end
of
life
with
your
rich
husband
the
utmost
degree
of
that
happiness
which
you
had
the
right
to
believe
you
could
not
win
with
the
poor
young
scholar
who
loved
you
if
though
i
can
not
even
now
imagine
it
if
your
beautiful
hair
has
become
white
clementine
bear
worthily
the
bundle
of
keys
confided
to
you
by
noel
alexandre
and
impart
to
your
grandchildren
the
knowledge
of
all
domestic
virtues
ah
beautiful
night
she
rules
with
such
noble
repose
over
men
and
animals
alike
kindly
loosed
by
her
from
the
yoke
of
daily
toil
and
even
i
feel
her
beneficent
influence
although
my
habits
of
sixty
years
have
so
changed
me
that
i
can
feel
most
things
only
through
the
signs
which
represent
them
my
world
is
wholly
formed
of
words
so
much
of
a
philologist
i
have
become
each
one
dreams
the
dream
of
life
in
his
own
way
i
have
dreamed
it
in
my
library
and
when
the
hour
shall
come
in
which
i
must
leave
this
world
may
it
please
god
to
take
me
from
my
ladder
from
before
my
shelves
of
books
well
well
it
is
really
himself
pardieu
how
are
you
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
and
where
have
you
been
travelling
to
all
this
time
over
the
country
while
i
was
waiting
for
you
at
the
station
with
my
cabriolet
you
missed
me
when
the
train
came
in
and
i
was
driving
back
quite
disappointed
to
lusance
give
me
your
valise
and
get
up
here
beside
me
in
the
carriage
why
do
you
know
it
is
fully
seven
kilometres
from
here
to
the
chateau
who
addresses
me
thus
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
from
the
height
of
his
cabriolet
monsieur
paul
de
gabry
nephew
and
heir
of
monsieur
honore
de
gabry
peer
of
france
in
who
recently
died
at
monaco
and
it
was
precisely
to
monsieur
paul
de
gabry
s
house
that
i
was
going
with
that
valise
of
mine
so
carefully
strapped
by
my
housekeeper
this
excellent
young
man
has
just
inherited
conjointly
with
his
two
the
property
of
his
uncle
who
belonging
to
a
very
ancient
family
of
distinguished
lawyers
had
accumulated
in
his
chateau
at
lusance
a
library
rich
in
some
dating
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
inventory
and
catalogue
of
these
mss
that
i
had
come
to
lusance
at
the
urgent
request
of
monsieur
paul
de
gabry
whose
father
a
perfect
gentleman
and
distinguished
bibliophile
had
maintained
the
most
pleasant
relations
with
me
during
his
lifetime
to
tell
the
truth
monsieur
paul
has
not
inherited
the
fine
tastes
of
his
father
monsieur
paul
likes
sporting
he
is
a
great
authority
on
horses
and
dogs
and
i
much
fear
that
of
all
the
sciences
capable
of
satisfying
or
of
duping
the
inexhaustible
curiosity
of
mankind
those
of
the
stable
and
the
are
the
only
ones
thoroughly
mastered
by
him
i
can
not
say
i
was
surprised
to
meet
him
since
we
had
made
a
rendezvous
but
i
acknowledge
that
i
had
become
so
preoccupied
with
my
own
thoughts
that
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
chateau
de
lusance
and
its
inhabitants
and
that
the
voice
of
the
gentleman
calling
out
to
me
as
i
started
to
follow
the
country
road
winding
away
before
me
un
bon
ruban
de
queue
as
they
say
had
given
me
quite
a
start
i
fear
my
face
must
have
betrayed
my
incongruous
distraction
by
a
certain
stupid
expression
which
it
is
apt
to
assume
in
most
of
my
social
transactions
my
valise
was
pulled
up
into
the
carriage
and
i
followed
my
valise
my
host
pleased
me
by
his
straightforward
simplicity
i
don
t
know
anything
myself
about
your
old
parchments
he
said
but
i
think
you
will
find
some
folks
to
talk
to
at
the
house
besides
the
cure
who
writes
books
himself
and
the
doctor
who
is
a
very
good
fellow
although
a
radical
you
will
meet
somebody
able
to
keep
your
company
i
mean
my
wife
she
is
not
a
very
learned
woman
but
there
are
few
things
which
she
can
t
divine
pretty
well
then
i
count
upon
being
able
to
keep
you
with
us
long
enough
to
make
you
acquainted
with
mademoiselle
jeanne
who
has
the
fingers
of
a
magician
and
the
soul
of
an
and
is
this
delightfully
gifted
young
lady
one
of
your
family
i
asked
not
at
all
replied
monsieur
paul
then
she
is
just
a
friend
of
yours
i
persisted
rather
stupidly
she
has
lost
both
her
father
and
mother
answered
monsieur
de
gabry
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ears
of
his
horse
whose
hoofs
rang
loudly
over
the
road
by
the
moonshine
her
father
managed
to
get
us
into
some
very
serious
trouble
and
we
did
not
get
off
with
a
fright
either
then
he
shook
his
head
and
changed
the
subject
he
gave
me
due
warning
of
the
ruinous
condition
in
which
i
should
find
the
chateau
and
the
park
they
had
been
absolutely
deserted
for
years
i
learned
from
him
that
monsieur
honore
de
gabry
his
uncle
had
been
on
very
bad
terms
with
some
poachers
whom
he
used
to
shoot
at
like
rabbits
one
of
them
a
vindictive
peasant
who
had
received
a
whole
charge
of
shot
in
his
face
lay
in
wait
for
the
seigneur
one
evening
behind
the
trees
of
the
mall
and
very
nearly
succeeded
in
killing
him
for
the
ball
took
off
the
tip
of
his
ear
my
uncle
monsieur
paul
continued
tried
to
discover
who
had
fired
the
shot
but
he
could
not
see
any
one
and
he
walked
back
slowly
to
the
house
the
day
after
he
called
his
steward
and
ordered
him
to
close
up
the
manor
and
the
park
and
allow
no
living
soul
to
enter
he
expressly
forbade
that
anything
should
be
touched
or
looked
after
or
any
repairs
made
on
the
estate
during
his
absence
he
added
between
his
teeth
that
he
would
return
at
easter
or
trinity
sunday
as
they
say
in
the
song
and
just
as
the
song
has
it
trinity
sunday
passed
without
a
sign
of
him
he
died
last
year
at
monaco
my
and
myself
were
the
first
to
enter
the
chateau
after
it
had
been
abandoned
for
years
we
found
a
growing
in
the
middle
of
the
parlour
as
for
the
park
it
was
useless
trying
to
visit
it
because
there
were
no
longer
any
paths
or
my
companion
ceased
to
speak
and
only
the
regular
of
the
trotting
horse
and
the
chirping
of
insects
in
the
grass
broke
the
silence
on
either
hand
the
sheaves
standing
in
the
fields
took
in
the
vague
moonlight
the
appearance
of
tall
white
women
kneeling
down
and
i
abandoned
myself
awhile
to
those
wonderful
childish
fancies
which
the
charm
of
night
always
suggests
after
driving
under
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
mall
we
turned
to
the
right
and
rolled
up
a
lordly
avenue
at
the
end
of
which
the
chateau
suddenly
rose
into
view
a
black
mass
with
turrets
en
poivriere
we
followed
a
sort
of
causeway
which
gave
access
to
the
and
which
passing
over
a
moat
full
of
running
water
doubtless
replaced
a
drawbridge
the
loss
of
that
must
have
been
i
think
the
first
of
various
humiliations
to
which
the
warlike
manor
had
been
subjected
ere
being
reduced
to
that
pacific
aspect
with
which
it
received
me
the
stars
reflected
themselves
with
marvelous
clearness
in
the
dark
water
monsieur
paul
like
a
courteous
host
escorted
me
to
my
chamber
at
the
very
top
of
the
building
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
and
then
excusing
himself
for
not
presenting
me
at
once
to
his
wife
by
reason
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
bade
me
my
apartment
painted
in
white
and
hung
with
chintz
seemed
to
keep
some
traces
of
the
elegant
gallantry
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
heap
of
ashes
which
testified
to
the
pains
taken
to
dispel
humidity
filled
the
fireplace
whose
marble
mantlepiece
supported
a
bust
of
marie
antoinette
in
bisuit
attached
to
the
frame
of
the
tarnished
and
discoloured
mirror
two
brass
hooks
that
had
once
doubtless
served
the
ladies
of
days
to
hang
their
chatelaines
on
seemed
to
offer
a
very
opportune
means
of
suspending
my
watch
which
i
took
care
to
wind
up
beforehand
for
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
thelemites
i
hold
that
man
is
only
master
of
time
which
is
life
itself
when
he
has
divided
it
into
hours
minutes
and
seconds
that
is
to
say
into
parts
proportioned
to
the
brevity
of
human
existence
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
life
really
seems
short
to
us
only
because
we
measure
it
irrationally
by
our
own
mad
hopes
we
have
all
of
us
like
the
old
man
in
the
fable
a
new
wing
to
add
to
our
building
i
want
for
example
before
i
die
to
finish
my
history
of
the
abbots
of
the
time
god
allots
to
each
one
of
us
is
like
a
precious
tissue
which
we
embroider
as
we
best
know
how
i
had
begun
my
woof
with
all
sorts
of
philological
illustrations
so
my
thoughts
wandered
on
and
at
last
as
i
bound
my
foulard
about
my
head
the
notion
of
time
led
me
back
to
the
past
and
for
the
second
time
within
the
same
round
of
the
dial
i
thought
of
you
clementine
to
bless
you
again
in
your
prosperity
if
you
have
any
before
blowing
out
my
candle
and
falling
asleep
amid
the
chanting
of
the
frogs
chapter
ii
during
breakfast
i
had
many
opportunities
to
appreciate
the
good
taste
tact
and
intelligence
of
madame
de
gabry
who
told
me
that
the
chateau
had
its
ghosts
and
was
especially
haunted
by
the
a
prisoner
during
her
lifetime
and
thereafter
a
i
could
never
describe
how
much
wit
and
animation
she
gave
to
this
old
nurse
s
tale
we
took
out
coffee
on
the
terrace
whose
balusters
clasped
and
forcibly
torn
away
from
their
stone
coping
by
a
vigorous
growth
of
ivy
remained
suspended
in
the
grasp
of
the
amorous
plant
like
bewildered
athenian
women
in
the
arms
of
ravishing
centaurs
the
chateau
shaped
something
like
a
wagon
with
a
turret
at
each
of
the
four
angles
had
lost
all
original
character
by
reason
of
repeated
remodellings
it
was
merely
a
fine
spacious
building
nothing
more
it
did
not
appear
to
me
to
have
suffered
much
damage
during
its
abandonment
of
years
but
when
madame
de
gabry
conducted
me
into
the
great
salon
of
the
i
saw
that
the
planking
was
bulged
in
and
out
the
plinths
rotten
the
wainscotings
split
apart
the
paintings
of
the
piers
turned
black
and
hanging
more
than
half
out
of
their
settings
a
after
forcing
up
the
planks
of
the
floor
had
grown
tall
under
the
ceiling
and
was
reaching
out
its
branches
towards
the
glassless
windows
this
spectacle
was
not
devoid
of
charm
but
i
could
not
look
at
it
without
anxiety
as
i
remembered
that
the
rich
library
of
monsieur
honore
de
gabry
in
an
adjoining
apartment
must
have
been
exposed
for
the
same
length
of
time
to
the
same
forces
of
decay
yet
as
i
looked
at
the
young
in
the
salon
i
could
not
but
admire
the
magnificent
vigour
of
nature
and
that
resistless
power
which
forces
every
germ
to
develop
into
life
on
the
other
hand
i
felt
saddened
to
think
that
whatever
effort
we
scholars
may
make
to
preserve
dead
things
from
passing
away
we
are
labouring
painfully
in
vain
whatever
has
lived
becomes
the
necessary
food
of
new
existences
and
the
arab
who
builds
himself
a
hut
out
of
the
marble
fragments
of
a
palmyra
temple
is
really
more
of
a
philosopher
than
all
the
guardians
of
museums
at
london
munich
or
paris
august
all
day
long
i
have
been
classifying
mss
the
sun
came
in
through
the
loft
uncurtained
windows
and
during
my
reading
often
very
interesting
i
could
hear
the
languid
bumblebees
bump
heavily
against
the
windows
and
the
flies
intoxicated
with
light
and
heat
making
their
wings
hum
in
circles
around
my
head
so
loud
became
their
humming
about
three
o
clock
that
i
looked
up
from
the
document
i
was
reading
a
document
containing
very
precious
materials
for
the
history
of
melun
in
the
thirteenth
century
to
watch
the
concentric
movements
of
those
tiny
creatures
bestions
lafontaine
calls
them
he
found
this
form
of
the
word
in
the
old
popular
speech
whence
also
the
term
applied
to
figured
tapestry
i
was
compelled
to
confess
that
the
effect
of
heat
upon
the
wings
of
a
fly
is
totally
different
from
that
it
exerts
upon
the
brain
of
a
paleographical
archivist
for
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
think
and
a
rather
pleasant
languor
weighing
upon
me
from
which
i
could
rouse
myself
only
by
a
very
determined
effort
the
then
startled
me
in
the
midst
of
my
labours
and
i
had
barely
time
to
put
on
my
new
so
as
to
make
a
respectable
appearance
before
madame
de
gabry
the
repast
generously
served
seemed
to
prolong
itself
for
my
benefit
i
am
more
than
a
fair
judge
of
wine
and
my
hostess
who
discovered
my
knowledge
in
this
regard
was
friendly
enough
to
open
a
certain
bottle
of
in
my
honour
with
deep
respect
i
drank
of
this
famous
and
knightly
old
wine
which
comes
from
the
slopes
of
bordeaux
and
of
which
the
flavour
and
exhilarating
power
are
beyond
praise
the
ardour
of
it
spread
gently
through
my
veins
and
filled
me
with
an
almost
juvenile
animation
seated
beside
madame
de
gabry
on
the
terrace
in
the
gloaming
which
gave
a
charming
melancholy
to
the
park
and
lent
to
every
object
an
air
of
mystery
i
took
pleasure
in
communicating
my
impression
of
the
scene
to
my
hostess
i
discoursed
with
a
vivacity
quite
remarkable
on
the
part
of
a
man
so
devoid
of
imagination
as
i
am
i
described
to
her
spontaneously
without
quoting
from
an
old
texts
the
caressing
melancholy
of
the
evening
and
the
beauty
of
that
natal
earth
which
feeds
us
not
only
with
bread
and
wine
but
also
with
ideas
sentiments
and
beliefs
and
which
will
at
last
take
us
all
back
to
her
maternal
breast
again
like
so
many
tired
little
children
at
the
close
of
a
long
day
monsieur
said
the
kind
lady
you
see
these
old
towers
those
trees
that
sky
is
it
not
quite
natural
that
the
personage
of
the
popular
tales
and
should
have
been
evoked
by
such
scenes
why
over
there
is
the
very
path
which
little
red
followed
when
she
went
to
the
woods
to
pick
nuts
across
this
changeful
and
always
vapoury
sky
the
fairy
chariots
used
to
roll
and
the
north
tower
might
have
sheltered
under
its
pointed
roof
that
same
old
spinning
woman
whose
distaff
picked
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
i
continued
to
muse
upon
her
pretty
fancies
while
monsieur
paul
related
to
me
as
he
puffed
a
very
strong
cigar
the
history
of
some
suit
he
had
brought
against
the
commune
about
a
madame
de
gabry
feeling
the
chill
night
air
began
to
shiver
under
the
shawl
her
husband
had
wrapped
about
her
and
left
us
to
go
to
her
room
i
then
decided
instead
of
going
to
my
own
to
return
to
the
library
and
continue
my
examination
of
the
manuscripts
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
monsieur
paul
i
entered
what
i
may
call
in
phrase
the
and
started
to
work
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
after
having
read
fifteen
pages
evidently
written
by
some
ignorant
and
careless
scribe
for
i
could
scarcely
discern
their
meaning
i
plunged
my
hand
into
the
pocket
of
my
coat
to
get
my
but
this
movement
usually
so
natural
and
almost
instinctive
this
time
cost
me
some
effort
and
even
fatigue
nevertheless
i
got
out
the
silver
box
and
took
from
it
a
pinch
of
the
odorous
powder
which
somehow
or
other
i
managed
to
spill
all
over
my
under
my
baffled
nose
i
am
sure
my
nose
must
have
expressed
its
disappointment
for
it
is
a
very
expressive
nose
more
than
once
it
has
betrayed
my
secret
thoughts
and
especially
upon
a
certain
occasion
at
the
public
library
of
coutances
where
i
discovered
right
in
front
of
my
colleague
brioux
the
cartulary
of
what
a
delight
my
little
eyes
remained
as
dull
and
expressionless
as
ever
behind
my
spectacles
but
at
the
mere
sight
of
my
thick
which
quivered
with
joy
and
pride
brioux
knew
that
i
had
found
something
he
noted
the
volume
i
was
looking
at
observed
the
place
where
i
put
it
back
pounced
upon
it
as
soon
as
i
turned
my
heel
copied
it
secretly
and
published
in
haste
for
the
sake
of
playing
me
a
trick
but
his
edition
swarms
with
errors
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
afterwards
criticising
some
of
the
gross
blunders
he
made
but
to
come
back
to
the
point
at
which
i
left
off
i
began
to
suspect
that
i
was
getting
very
sleepy
indeed
i
was
looking
at
a
chart
of
which
the
interest
may
be
divined
from
the
fact
that
it
contained
mention
of
a
hutch
sold
to
jehan
d
estonville
priest
in
but
although
even
then
i
could
recognise
the
importance
of
the
document
i
did
not
give
it
that
attention
it
so
strongly
invited
my
eyes
would
keep
turning
against
my
will
towards
a
certain
corner
of
the
table
where
there
was
nothing
whatever
interesting
to
a
learned
mind
there
was
only
a
big
german
book
there
bound
in
pigskin
with
brass
studs
on
the
sides
and
very
thick
cording
upon
the
back
it
was
a
find
copy
of
a
compilation
which
has
little
to
recommend
it
except
the
wood
engravings
it
contains
and
which
is
known
as
the
cosmography
of
this
volume
with
its
covers
slightly
open
was
placed
upon
edge
with
the
back
upwards
i
could
not
say
for
how
long
i
had
been
staring
causelessly
at
the
folio
when
my
eyes
were
captivated
by
a
sight
so
extraordinary
that
even
a
person
as
devoid
of
imagination
as
i
could
not
but
have
been
greatly
astonished
by
it
i
perceived
all
of
a
sudden
without
having
noticed
her
coming
into
the
room
a
little
creature
seated
on
the
back
of
the
book
with
one
knee
bent
and
one
leg
hanging
down
somewhat
in
the
attitude
of
the
amazons
of
hyde
park
or
the
bois
de
boulogne
on
horseback
she
was
so
small
that
her
swinging
foot
did
not
reach
the
table
over
which
the
trail
of
her
dress
extended
in
a
serpentine
line
but
her
face
and
figure
were
those
of
an
adult
the
fulness
of
her
corsage
and
the
roundness
of
her
waist
could
leave
no
doubt
of
that
even
for
an
old
savant
like
myself
i
will
venture
to
add
that
she
was
very
handsome
with
a
proud
mien
for
my
iconographic
studies
have
long
accustomed
me
to
recognise
at
once
the
perfection
of
a
type
and
the
character
of
a
physiognomy
the
countenance
of
this
lady
who
had
seated
herself
inopportunely
on
the
back
of
cosmography
of
munster
expressed
a
mingling
of
haughtiness
and
mischievousness
she
had
the
air
of
a
queen
but
a
capricious
queen
and
i
judged
from
the
mere
expression
of
her
eyes
that
she
was
accustomed
to
wield
great
authority
somewhere
in
a
very
whimsical
manner
her
mouth
was
imperious
and
mocking
and
those
blue
eyes
of
hers
seemed
to
laugh
in
a
disquieting
way
under
her
finely
arched
black
eyebrows
i
have
always
heard
that
black
eyebrows
are
very
becoming
to
blondes
but
this
lady
was
very
blonde
on
the
whole
the
impression
she
gave
me
was
one
of
greatness
it
may
seem
odd
to
say
that
a
person
who
was
no
taller
than
a
and
who
might
have
been
hidden
in
my
coat
pocket
but
that
it
would
have
been
very
disrespectful
to
put
her
in
it
gave
me
precisely
an
idea
of
greatness
but
in
the
fine
proportions
of
the
lady
seated
upon
the
cosmography
of
munster
there
was
such
a
proud
elegance
such
a
harmonious
majesty
and
she
maintained
an
attitude
at
once
so
easy
and
so
noble
that
she
really
seemed
to
me
a
very
great
person
although
my
which
she
examined
with
an
expression
of
such
mockery
as
appeared
to
indicate
that
she
knew
in
advance
every
word
that
would
come
out
of
it
at
the
end
of
my
pen
was
for
her
a
deep
basin
in
which
she
would
have
blackened
her
pink
stockings
up
to
the
garter
i
can
assure
you
that
she
was
great
and
imposing
even
in
her
sprightliness
her
costume
worthy
of
her
face
was
extremely
magnificent
it
consisted
of
a
robe
of
brocade
and
a
mantle
of
nacarat
velvet
lined
with
vair
her
was
a
sort
of
hennin
with
two
high
points
and
pearls
of
splendid
lustre
made
it
bright
and
luminous
as
a
crescent
moon
her
little
white
hand
held
a
wand
that
wand
drew
my
attention
very
strongly
because
my
archaeological
studies
had
taught
me
to
recognise
with
certainty
every
sign
by
which
the
notable
personages
of
legend
and
of
history
are
distinguished
this
knowledge
came
to
my
aid
during
various
very
queer
conjectures
with
which
i
was
labouring
i
examined
the
wand
and
saw
that
it
appeared
to
have
been
cut
from
a
branch
of
hazel
then
its
a
fairy
s
wand
i
said
to
myself
consequently
the
lady
who
carries
it
is
a
happy
at
thus
discovering
what
sort
of
a
person
was
before
me
i
tried
to
collect
my
mind
sufficiently
to
make
her
a
graceful
compliment
it
would
have
given
me
much
satisfaction
i
confess
if
i
could
have
talked
to
her
about
the
part
taken
by
her
people
not
less
in
the
life
of
the
saxon
and
germanic
races
than
in
that
of
the
latin
occident
such
a
dissertation
it
appeared
to
me
would
have
been
an
ingenious
method
of
thanking
the
lady
for
having
thus
appeared
to
an
old
scholar
contrary
to
the
invariable
custom
of
her
kindred
who
never
show
themselves
but
to
innocent
children
or
ignorant
because
one
happens
to
be
a
fairy
one
is
none
the
less
a
woman
i
said
to
myself
and
since
madame
recamier
according
to
what
i
heard
ampere
say
used
to
blush
with
pleasure
when
the
little
opened
their
eyes
as
wide
as
they
could
to
look
at
her
surely
the
supernatural
lady
seated
upon
the
cosmography
of
munster
might
feel
flattered
to
hear
an
erudite
man
discourse
learnedly
about
her
as
about
a
medal
a
seal
a
fibula
or
a
token
but
such
an
undertaking
which
would
have
cost
my
timidity
a
great
deal
became
totally
out
of
the
question
when
i
observed
the
lady
of
the
cosmography
suddenly
take
from
an
alms
purse
hanging
at
her
girdle
the
very
smallest
of
nuts
i
had
ever
seen
crack
the
shells
between
her
teeth
and
throw
them
at
my
nose
while
she
nibbled
the
kernels
with
the
gravity
of
a
sucking
child
at
this
conjuncture
i
did
what
the
dignity
of
science
demanded
of
me
i
remained
silent
but
the
caused
such
a
painful
tickling
that
i
put
up
my
hand
to
my
nose
and
found
to
my
great
surprise
that
my
spectacles
were
straddling
the
very
end
of
it
so
that
i
was
actually
looking
at
the
lady
not
through
my
spectacles
but
over
them
this
was
incomprehensible
because
my
eyes
worn
out
over
old
texts
can
not
ordinarily
distinguish
anything
without
glasses
could
not
tell
a
melon
from
a
decanter
though
the
two
were
placed
close
up
to
my
nose
that
nose
of
mine
remarkable
for
its
size
its
shape
and
its
coloration
legitimately
attracted
the
attention
of
the
fairy
for
she
seized
my
pen
which
was
sticking
up
from
the
like
a
plume
and
she
began
to
pass
the
of
that
pen
over
my
nose
i
had
had
more
than
once
in
company
occasion
to
suffer
cheerfully
from
the
innocent
mischief
of
young
ladies
who
made
me
join
their
games
and
would
offer
me
their
cheeks
to
kiss
through
the
back
of
a
chair
or
invite
me
to
blow
out
a
candle
which
they
would
lift
suddenly
above
the
range
of
my
breath
but
until
that
moment
no
person
of
the
fair
sex
had
ever
subjected
me
to
such
a
whimsical
piece
of
familiarity
as
that
of
tickling
my
nose
with
my
own
feather
pen
happily
i
remembered
the
maxim
of
my
late
grandfather
who
was
accustomed
to
say
that
everything
was
permissible
on
the
part
of
ladies
and
that
whatever
they
do
to
us
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
grace
and
a
favour
therefore
as
a
grace
and
a
favour
i
received
the
nutshells
and
the
titillations
with
my
own
pen
and
i
tried
to
smile
much
more
i
even
found
speech
madame
i
said
with
dignified
politeness
you
accord
the
honour
of
a
visit
not
to
a
silly
child
not
to
a
boor
but
to
a
bibliophile
who
is
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
who
knows
that
long
ago
you
used
to
make
in
the
manes
of
mares
at
the
crib
drink
the
milk
from
the
slip
down
the
backs
of
our
make
the
hearth
sputter
in
the
faces
of
the
old
folks
and
in
short
fill
the
house
with
disorder
and
gaiety
you
can
also
boast
of
giving
the
nicest
frights
in
the
world
to
lovers
who
stayed
out
in
the
woods
too
late
of
evenings
but
i
thought
you
had
vanished
out
of
existence
at
least
three
centuries
ago
can
it
really
be
madame
that
you
are
still
to
be
seen
in
this
age
of
railways
and
telegraphs
my
concierge
who
used
to
be
a
nurse
in
her
young
days
does
not
know
your
story
and
my

straightening
up
her
royal
little
figure
in
a
very
haughty
fashion
and
whipping
the
back
of
the

rubbing
my

the
most
deplorable
effect
upon

said
to

you
are
nothing
but
an
old
pedant
i
always
suspected
as
much
the
smallest
little
ragamuffin
who
goes
along
the
road
with
his
sticking
out
through
a
hole
in
his
pantaloons
knows
more
about
me
than
all
the
old
spectacled
folks
in
your
institutes
and
your
academies
to
know
is
nothing
at
all
to
imagine
is
everything
nothing
exists
except
that
which
is
imagined
i
am
imaginary
that
is
what
it
is
to
exist
i
should
think
i
am
dreamed
of
and
i
appear
everything
is
only
dream
and
as
nobody
ever
dreams
about
you
sylvestre

it
is
you

do
not

rise
each
morning
from
the
hollow
meadow
in
the
thickets
of
pink

i

i
am

there
are

uttered
weird
thrills
of
pleasure
felt
by
those
who
follow
the
light

of
my

i

the
dead

you

sylvestre
bonnard
your
warm
coat
covers
the
hide
of
an
ass
she
ceased
speaking
her
delicate
nostrils
swelled
with
indignation
and
while
i
admired
despite
my
vexation
the
heroic
anger
of
this
little
person
she
pushed
my
pen
about
in
the
backward
and
forward
like
an
oar
and
then
suddenly
threw
it
at
my
nose
point
first
i
rubbed
by
face
and
felt
it
all
covered
with
ink
she
had
disappeared
my
lamp
was
extinguished
a
ray
of
moonlight
streamed
down
through
a
window
and
descended
upon
the
cosmography
of
a
strong
cool
wind
which
had
arisen
very
suddenly
without
my
knowledge
was
blowing
my
papers
pens
and
wafers
about
my
table
was
all
stained
with
ink
i
had
left
my
window
open
during
the
storm
what
an
imprudence
chapter
iii
i
wrote
to
my
housekeeper
as
i
promised
that
i
was
safe
and
sound
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
tell
her
that
i
had
caught
a
cold
from
going
to
sleep
in
the
library
at
night
with
the
window
open
for
the
good
woman
would
have
been
as
unsparing
in
her
remonstrances
to
me
as
parliaments
to
kings
at
your
age
monsieur
she
would
have
been
sure
to
say
one
ought
to
have
more
she
is
simple
enough
to
believe
that
sense
grows
with
age
i
seem
to
her
an
exception
to
this
rule
not
having
any
similar
motive
for
concealing
my
experiences
from
madame
de
gabry
i
told
her
all
about
my
vision
which
she
seemed
to
enjoy
very
much
why
that
was
a
charming
dream
of
yours
she
said
and
one
must
have
real
genius
to
dream
such
a
then
i
am
a
real
genius
when
i
am
asleep
i
responded
when
you
dream
she
replied
and
you
are
always
i
know
that
madame
de
gabry
in
making
this
remark
only
wished
to
please
me
but
that
intention
alone
deserves
my
utmost
gratitude
and
it
is
therefore
in
a
spirit
of
thankfulness
and
kindliest
remembrance
that
i
write
down
her
words
which
i
will
read
over
and
over
again
until
my
dying
day
and
which
will
never
be
read
by
any
one
save
myself
i
passed
the
next
few
days
in
completing
the
inventory
of
the
manuscripts
in
the
lusance
library
certain
confidential
observations
dropped
by
monsieur
paul
de
gabry
however
caused
me
some
painful
surprise
and
made
me
decide
to
pursue
the
work
after
a
different
manner
from
that
in
which
i
had
begun
it
from
those
few
words
i
learned
that
the
fortune
of
monsieur
honore
de
gabry
which
had
been
badly
managed
for
many
years
and
subsequently
swept
away
to
a
large
extent
through
the
failure
of
a
banker
whose
name
i
do
not
know
had
been
transmitted
to
the
heirs
of
the
old
french
nobleman
only
under
the
form
of
mortgaged
real
estate
and
irrecoverable
assets
monsieur
paul
by
agreement
with
his
joint
heirs
had
decided
to
sell
the
library
and
i
was
intrusted
with
the
task
of
making
arrangements
to
have
the
sale
effected
upon
advantageous
terms
but
totally
ignorant
as
i
was
of
all
the
business
methods
and
i
thought
it
best
to
get
the
advice
of
a
publisher
who
was
one
of
my
private
friends
i
wrote
him
at
once
to
come
and
join
me
at
lusance
and
while
waiting
for
his
arrival
i
took
my
hat
and
cane
and
made
visits
to
the
different
churches
of
the
diocese
in
several
of
which
i
knew
there
were
certain
mortuary
inscriptions
to
be
found
which
had
never
been
correctly
copied
so
i
left
my
hosts
and
departed
my
pilgrimage
exploring
the
churches
and
the
cemeteries
every
day
visiting
the
parish
priests
and
the
village
notaries
supping
at
the
public
inns
with
peddlers
and
sleeping
at
night
between
sheets
scented
with
lavender
i
passed
one
whole
week
in
the
quiet
but
profound
enjoyment
of
observing
the
living
engaged
in
their
various
daily
occupations
even
while
i
was
thinking
of
the
dead
as
for
the
purpose
of
my
researches
i
made
only
a
few
mediocre
discoveries
which
caused
me
only
a
mediocre
joy
and
one
therefore
salubrious
and
not
at
all
fatiguing
i
copied
a
few
interesting
epitaphs
and
i
added
to
this
little
collection
a
few
recipes
for
cooking
country
dishes
which
a
certain
good
priest
kindly
gave
me
with
these
riches
i
returned
to
lusance
and
i
crossed
the
with
such
secret
satisfaction
as
a
bourgeois
fells
on
entering
his
own
home
this
was
the
effect
of
the
kindness
of
my
hosts
and
the
impression
i
received
on
crossing
their
threshold
proves
better
than
any
reasoning
could
do
the
excellence
of
their
hospitality
i
entered
the
great
parlour
without
meeting
anybody
and
the
young
there
spreading
out
its
broad
leaves
seemed
to
me
like
an
old
friend
but
the
next
thing
which
i
saw
on
the
caused
me
such
a
shock
of
surprise
that
i
readjusted
my
glasses
upon
my
nose
with
both
hands
at
once
and
then
felt
myself
over
so
as
to
get
at
least
some
superficial
proof
of
my
own
existence
in
less
than
one
second
there
thronged
from
my
mind
twenty
different
conjectures
the
most
rational
of
which
was
that
i
had
suddenly
become
crazy
it
seemed
to
me
absolutely
impossible
that
what
i
was
looking
at
could
exist
yet
it
was
equally
impossible
for
me
not
to
see
it
as
a
thing
actually
existing
what
caused
my
surprise
was
resting
on
the
above
which
rose
a
great
dull
speckled
mirror
i
saw
myself
in
that
mirror
and
i
can
say
that
i
saw
for
once
in
my
life
the
perfect
image
of
stupefaction
but
i
made
proper
allowance
for
myself
i
approved
myself
for
being
so
stupefied
by
a
really
stupefying
thing
the
object
i
was
thus
examining
with
a
degree
of
astonishment
that
all
my
reasoning
power
failed
to
lessen
obtruded
itself
on
my
attention
though
quite
motionless
the
persistence
and
fixity
of
the
phenomenon
excluded
any
idea
of
hallucination
i
am
totally
exempt
from
all
nervous
disorders
capable
of
influencing
the
sense
of
sight
the
cause
of
such
visual
disturbance
is
i
think
generally
due
to
stomach
trouble
and
thank
god
i
have
an
excellent
stomach
moreover
visual
illusions
are
accompanied
with
special
abnormal
conditions
which
impress
the
victims
of
hallucination
themselves
and
inspire
them
with
a
sort
of
terror
now
i
felt
nothing
of
this
kind
the
object
which
i
saw
although
seemingly
impossible
in
itself
appeared
to
me
under
all
the
natural
conditions
of
reality
i
observed
that
it
had
three
dimensions
and
colours
and
that
it
cast
a
shadow
ah
how
i
stared
at
it
the
water
came
into
my
eyes
so
that
i
had
to
wipe
the
glasses
of
my
spectacles
finally
i
found
myself
obliged
to
yield
to
the
evidence
and
to
affirm
that
i
had
really
before
my
eyes
the
fairy
the
very
same
fairy
i
had
been
dreaming
of
in
the
library
a
few
evenings
before
it
was
she
it
was
her
very
self
i
assure
you
she
had
the
same
air
of
the
same
proud
supple
poise
she
held
the
same
hazel
wand
in
her
hand
she
still
wore
her
and
the
train
of
her
long
brocade
robe
undulated
about
her
little
feet
same
face
same
figure
it
was
she
indeed
and
to
prevent
any
possible
doubt
of
it
she
was
seated
on
the
back
of
a
huge
book
strongly
resembling
the
cosmography
of
her
immobility
but
half
reassured
me
i
was
really
afraid
that
she
was
going
to
take
some
more
nuts
out
of
her
and
throw
the
shells
at
my
face
i
was
standing
there
waving
my
hands
and
gaping
when
the
musical
and
laughing
voice
of
madame
de
gabry
suddenly
rang
in
my
ears
so
you
are
examining
your
fairy
monsieur
bonnard
said
my
hostess
well
do
you
think
the
resemblance
good
it
was
very
quickly
said
but
even
while
hearing
it
i
had
time
to
perceive
that
my
fairy
was
a
statuette
in
coloured
wax
modeled
with
much
taste
and
spirit
by
some
novice
hand
but
the
phenomenon
even
thus
reduced
by
a
rational
explanation
did
not
cease
to
excite
my
surprise
how
and
by
whom
had
the
lady
of
the
cosmography
been
enabled
to
assume
plastic
existence
that
was
what
remained
for
me
to
learn
turning
towards
madame
de
gabry
i
perceived
that
she
was
not
alone
a
young
girl
dressed
in
black
was
standing
beside
her
she
had
large
intelligent
eyes
of
a
grey
as
sweet
as
that
of
the
sky
of
the
isle
of
france
and
at
once
artless
and
characteristic
in
their
expression
at
the
extremities
of
her
rather
thin
arms
were
fidgeting
uneasily
two
slender
hands
supple
but
slightly
red
as
it
becomes
the
hands
of
young
girls
to
be
sheathed
in
her
closely
fitting
merino
robe
she
had
the
slim
grace
of
a
young
tree
and
her
large
mouth
bespoke
frankness
i
could
not
describe
how
much
the
child
pleased
me
at
first
sight
she
was
not
beautiful
but
the
three
dimples
of
her
cheeks
and
chin
seemed
to
laugh
and
her
whole
person
which
revealed
the
awkwardness
of
innocence
had
something
in
it
indescribably
good
and
sincere
my
gaze
alternated
from
the
statuette
to
the
young
girl
and
i
saw
her
blush
so
frankly
and
fully
the
crimson
passing
over
her
face
as
by
waves
well
said
my
hostess
who
had
become
sufficiently
accustomed
to
my
distracted
moods
to
put
the
same
question
to
me
twice
is
that
the
very
same
lady
who
came
in
to
see
you
through
the
window
that
you
left
open
she
was
very
saucy
but
then
you
were
quite
imprudent
anyhow
do
you
recognise
her
it
is
her
very
self
i
replied
i
see
her
now
on
that
precisely
as
i
saw
her
on
the
table
in
the
then
if
that
be
so
replied
madame
de
gabry
you
have
to
blame
for
it
in
the
first
place
yourself
as
a
man
who
although
devoid
of
all
imagination
to
use
your
own
words
knew
how
to
depict
your
dream
in
such
vivid
colours
in
the
second
place
me
who
was
able
to
remember
and
repeat
faithfully
all
your
dream
and
lastly
mademoiselle
jeanne
whom
i
now
introduce
to
you
for
she
herself
modeled
that
wax
figure
precisely
according
to
my
madame
de
gabry
had
taken
the
young
girl
s
hand
as
she
spoke
but
the
latter
had
suddenly
broken
away
from
her
and
was
already
running
through
the
park
with
the
speed
of
a
bird
little
crazy
creature
madame
de
gabry
cried
after
her
how
can
one
be
so
shy
come
back
here
to
be
scolded
and
kissed
but
it
was
all
of
no
avail
the
frightened
child
disappeared
among
the
shrubbery
madame
de
gabry
seated
herself
in
the
only
chair
remaining
in
the
dilapidated
parlour
i
should
be
much
surprised
she
said
if
my
husband
had
not
already
spoken
to
you
of
jeanne
she
is
a
sweet
child
and
we
both
lover
her
very
much
tell
me
the
plain
truth
what
do
you
think
of
her
statuette
i
replied
that
the
work
was
full
of
good
taste
and
spirit
but
that
it
showed
some
want
of
study
and
practice
on
the
author
s
part
otherwise
i
had
been
extremely
touched
to
think
that
those
young
fingers
should
have
thus
embroidered
an
old
man
s
rough
sketch
of
fancy
and
given
form
so
brilliantly
to
the
dreams
of
a
dotard
like
myself
the
reason
i
ask
your
opinion
replied
madame
de
gabry
seriously
is
that
jeanne
is
a
poor
orphan
do
you
think
she
could
earn
her
living
by
modelling
statuettes
like
this
one
as
for
that
no
i
replied
and
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
regret
the
fact
you
say
the
girl
is
affectionate
and
sensitive
i
can
well
believe
you
i
could
believe
it
from
her
face
alone
there
are
excitements
in
which
impel
generous
hearts
to
act
out
of
all
rule
and
measure
this
young
creature
is
made
to
love
keep
her
for
the
domestic
hearth
there
only
is
real
but
she
has
no
dowry
replied
madame
de
gabry
then
extending
her
hand
to
me
she
continued
you
are
our
friend
i
can
tell
you
everything
the
father
of
this
child
was
a
banker
and
one
of
our
friends
he
went
into
a
colossal
speculation
and
it
ruined
him
he
survived
only
a
few
months
after
his
failure
in
which
as
paul
must
have
told
you
of
my
uncle
s
fortune
were
lost
and
more
than
half
of
our
own
we
had
made
his
acquaintance
at
manaco
during
the
winter
we
passed
there
at
my
uncle
s
house
he
had
an
adventurous
disposition
but
such
an
engaging
manner
he
deceived
himself
before
ever
he
deceived
others
after
all
it
is
in
the
ability
to
deceive
oneself
that
the
greatest
talent
is
shown
is
it
not
well
we
were
captured
my
husband
my
uncle
and
i
and
we
risked
much
more
than
a
reasonable
amount
in
a
very
hazardous
undertaking
but
bah
as
paul
says
since
we
have
no
children
we
need
not
worry
about
it
besides
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
friend
in
whom
we
trusted
was
an
honest
man
you
must
know
his
name
it
was
so
often
in
the
papers
an
on
public
placards
noel
alexandre
his
wife
was
a
very
sweet
person
i
knew
her
only
when
she
was
already
past
her
prime
with
traces
of
having
once
been
very
pretty
and
a
taste
for
fashionable
style
and
display
which
seemed
quite
becoming
to
her
she
was
naturally
fond
of
social
excitement
but
she
showed
a
great
deal
of
courage
and
dignity
after
the
death
of
her
husband
she
died
a
year
after
him
leaving
jeanne
alone
in
the
clementine
i
cried
out
and
on
thus
learning
what
i
had
never
imagined
the
mere
idea
of
which
would
have
set
all
the
forces
of
my
soul
in
revolt
upon
hearing
that
clementine
was
no
longer
in
this
world
something
like
a
great
silence
came
upon
me
and
the
feeling
which
flooded
my
whole
being
was
not
a
keen
strong
pain
but
a
quiet
and
solemn
sorrow
yet
i
was
conscious
of
some
incomprehensible
sense
of
alleviation
and
my
thought
rose
suddenly
to
heights
before
unknown
from
wheresoever
thou
art
at
this
moment
clementine
i
said
to
myself
look
down
upon
this
old
heart
now
indeed
cooled
by
age
yet
whose
blood
once
boiled
for
thy
sake
and
say
whether
it
is
not
reanimated
by
the
mere
thought
of
being
able
to
love
all
that
remains
of
thee
on
earth
everything
passes
away
since
thou
thyself
hast
passed
away
but
life
is
immortal
it
is
that
life
we
must
love
in
its
forms
eternally
renewed
all
the
rest
is
child
s
play
and
i
myself
with
all
my
books
am
only
like
a
child
playing
with
marbles
the
purpose
of
life
it
is
thou
clementine
who
has
revealed
it
to
me
madame
de
gabry
aroused
me
from
my
thoughts
by
murmuring
the
child
is
the
daughter
of
clementine
is
poor
i
exclaimed
aloud
how
fortunate
that
is
so
i
would
not
whish
that
any
one
by
myself
should
proved
for
her
and
dower
her
no
the
daughter
of
clementine
must
not
have
her
dowry
from
any
one
but
and
approaching
madame
de
gabry
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
i
took
her
right
hand
i
kissed
that
hand
and
placed
it
on
my
arm
and
said
you
will
conduct
me
to
the
grave
of
the
widow
of
noel
and
i
heard
madame
de
gabry
asking
me
why
are
you
crying
chapter
iv
the
little
april
saint
drocoveus
and
the
early
abbots
of
have
been
occupying
me
for
the
past
forty
years
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
shall
be
able
to
write
their
history
before
i
go
to
join
them
it
is
already
quite
a
long
time
since
i
became
an
old
man
one
day
last
year
on
the
pont
des
arts
one
of
my
fellow
members
at
the
institute
was
lamenting
before
me
over
the
ennui
of
becoming
old
still
replied
to
him
it
is
the
only
way
that
has
yet
been
found
of
living
a
long
i
have
tried
this
way
and
i
know
just
what
it
is
worth
the
trouble
of
it
is
not
that
one
lasts
too
long
but
that
one
sees
all
about
him
pass
away
mother
wife
friends
children
nature
makes
and
unmakes
all
these
divine
treasures
with
gloomy
indifference
and
at
last
we
find
that
we
have
not
loved
we
have
only
been
embracing
shadows
but
how
sweet
some
shadows
are
if
ever
creature
glided
like
a
shadow
through
the
life
of
a
man
it
was
certainly
that
young
girl
whom
i
fell
in
love
with
when
incredible
though
it
now
seems
i
was
myself
a
youth
a
christian
sarcophagus
from
the
catacombs
of
rome
bears
a
formula
of
imprecation
the
whole
terrible
meaning
of
which
i
only
learned
with
time
it
says
whatsoever
impious
man
violates
this
sepulchre
may
he
die
the
last
of
his
own
people
in
my
capacity
of
archaeologist
i
have
opened
tombs
and
disturbed
ashes
in
order
to
collect
the
shreds
of
apparel
metal
ornaments
or
gems
that
were
mingled
with
those
ashes
but
i
did
it
only
through
that
scientific
curiosity
which
does
not
exclude
feelings
of
reverence
and
of
piety
may
that
malediction
graven
by
some
one
of
the
first
followers
of
the
apostles
upon
a
martyr
s
tomb
never
fall
upon
me
i
ought
not
to
fear
to
survive
my
own
people
so
long
as
there
are
men
in
the
world
for
there
are
always
some
whom
one
can
love
but
the
power
of
love
itself
weakens
and
gradually
becomes
lost
with
age
like
all
the
other
energies
of
man
example
proves
it
and
it
is
this
which
terrifies
me
am
i
sure
that
i
have
not
myself
already
suffered
this
great
loss
i
should
surely
have
felt
it
but
for
the
happy
meeting
which
has
rejuvenated
me
poets
speak
of
the
fountain
of
youth
it
does
exist
it
gushes
up
from
the
earth
at
every
step
we
take
and
one
passes
by
without
drinking
of
it
the
young
girl
i
loved
married
of
her
own
choice
to
a
rival
passed
all
into
the
eternal
rest
i
have
found
her
daughter
so
that
my
life
which
before
seemed
to
me
without
utility
now
once
more
finds
a
purpose
and
a
reason
for
being
i
take
the
sun
as
they
say
in
provence
i
take
it
on
the
terrace
of
the
luxembourg
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
of
marguerite
de
navarre
it
is
a
spring
sun
intoxicating
as
young
wine
i
sit
and
dream
my
thoughts
escape
from
my
head
like
the
foam
from
a
bottle
of
beer
they
are
light
and
their
fizzing
amuses
me
i
dream
such
a
pastime
is
certainly
permissible
to
an
old
fellow
who
has
published
thirty
volumes
of
texts
and
contributed
to
the
journal
des
savants
for
years
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
i
performed
my
task
as
well
as
it
was
possible
for
me
to
do
and
that
i
utilised
to
their
fullest
extent
those
mediocre
faculties
with
which
nature
endowed
me
my
efforts
were
not
all
in
vain
and
i
have
contributed
in
my
own
modest
way
to
that
renaissance
of
historical
labours
which
will
remain
the
honour
of
this
restless
century
i
shall
certainly
be
counted
among
those
ten
or
twelve
who
revealed
to
france
her
own
literary
antiquities
my
publication
of
the
poetical
works
of
gautier
de
coincy
inaugurated
a
judicious
system
and
fixed
a
date
it
is
in
the
austere
calm
of
old
age
that
i
decree
to
myself
this
deserved
credit
and
god
who
sees
my
heart
knows
whether
pride
or
vanity
have
aught
to
do
with
this
of
justice
but
i
am
tired
my
eyes
are
dim
my
hand
trembles
and
i
see
an
image
of
myself
in
those
old
me
of
homer
whose
weakness
excluded
them
from
the
battle
and
who
seated
upon
the
ramparts
lifted
up
their
voices
like
crickets
among
the
leaves
so
my
thoughts
were
wandering
when
three
young
men
seated
themselves
near
me
i
do
not
know
whether
each
one
of
them
had
come
in
three
boats
like
the
monkey
of
lafontaine
but
the
three
certainly
displayed
themselves
over
the
space
of
twelve
chairs
i
took
pleasure
in
watching
them
not
because
they
had
anything
very
extraordinary
about
them
but
because
i
discerned
in
them
that
brave
joyous
manner
which
is
natural
to
youth
they
were
from
the
schools
i
was
less
assured
of
it
by
the
books
they
were
carrying
than
by
the
character
of
their
physiognomy
for
all
who
busy
themselves
with
the
things
of
the
mind
can
be
at
once
recognised
by
an
indescribably
something
which
is
common
to
all
of
them
i
am
very
fond
of
young
people
and
these
pleased
me
in
spite
of
a
certain
provoking
wild
manner
which
recalled
to
me
my
own
college
days
with
marvellous
vividness
but
they
did
not
wear
velvet
doublets
and
long
hair
as
we
used
to
do
they
did
not
walk
about
as
we
used
to
do
hell
and
malediction
they
were
quite
properly
dressed
and
neither
their
costume
nor
their
language
had
anything
suggestive
of
the
middle
ages
i
must
also
add
that
they
paid
considerable
attention
to
the
women
passing
on
the
terrace
and
expressed
their
admiration
of
some
of
them
in
very
animated
language
but
their
reflections
even
on
this
subject
were
not
of
a
character
to
oblige
me
to
flee
from
my
seat
besides
so
long
as
youth
is
studious
i
think
it
has
a
right
to
its
gaieties
one
of
them
having
made
some
gallant
pleasantry
which
i
forget
the
smallest
and
darkest
of
the
three
exclaimed
with
a
slight
gascon
accent
what
a
thing
to
say
only
physiologists
like
us
have
any
right
to
occupy
ourselves
about
living
matter
as
for
you
gelis
who
only
live
in
the
past
like
all
your
fellow
archivists
and
paleographers
you
will
do
better
to
confine
yourself
to
those
stone
women
over
there
who
are
your
and
he
pointed
to
the
statues
of
the
ladies
of
ancient
france
which
towered
up
all
white
in
a
under
the
trees
of
the
terrace
this
joke
though
in
itself
trifling
enabled
me
to
know
that
the
young
man
called
gelis
was
a
student
at
the
ecole
des
chartes
from
the
conversation
which
followed
i
was
able
to
learn
that
his
neighbor
blond
and
wan
almost
to
diaphaneity
taciturn
and
sarcastic
was
boulmier
a
fellow
student
gelis
and
the
future
doctor
i
hope
he
will
become
one
some
day
discoursed
together
with
much
fantasy
and
spirit
in
the
midst
of
the
loftiest
speculations
they
would
play
upon
words
and
make
jokes
after
the
peculiar
fashion
of
really
witty
persons
that
is
to
say
in
a
style
of
enormous
absurdity
i
need
hardly
say
i
suppose
that
they
only
deigned
to
maintain
the
most
monstrous
kind
of
paradoxes
they
employed
all
their
powers
of
imagination
to
make
themselves
as
ludicrous
as
possible
and
all
their
powers
of
reasoning
to
assert
the
contrary
of
common
sense
all
the
better
for
them
i
do
not
like
to
see
young
folks
too
rational
the
student
of
medicine
after
glancing
at
the
title
of
the
book
that
boulmier
held
in
his
hand
exclaimed
what
you
read
michelet
you
yes
replied
boulmier
very
gravely
i
like
gelis
who
dominated
both
by
his
fine
stature
imperious
gestures
and
ready
wit
took
the
book
turned
over
a
few
pages
rapidly
and
said
michelet
always
had
a
great
propensity
to
emotional
tenderness
he
wept
sweet
tears
over
maillard
that
nice
little
man
introduced
la
paperasserie
into
the
september
massacres
but
as
emotional
tenderness
leads
to
fury
he
becomes
all
at
once
furious
against
the
victims
there
was
no
help
for
it
it
is
the
sentimentality
of
the
age
the
assassin
is
pitied
but
the
victim
is
considered
quite
unpardonable
in
his
later
manner
michelet
is
more
michelet
than
ever
before
there
is
no
common
sense
in
it
it
is
simply
wonderful
neither
art
nor
science
neither
criticism
nor
narrative
only
furies
and
and
epileptic
fits
over
matters
which
he
never
deigns
to
explain
childish
outcries
envies
de
femme
grosse
and
a
style
my
friends
not
a
single
finished
phrase
it
is
astounding
and
he
handed
the
book
back
to
his
comrade
this
is
amusing
madness
i
thought
to
myself
and
not
quite
so
devoid
of
common
sense
as
it
appears
this
young
man
though
only
playing
has
sharply
touched
the
defect
in
the
but
the
provencal
student
declared
that
history
was
a
thoroughly
despicable
exercise
of
rhetoric
according
to
him
the
only
true
history
was
the
natural
history
of
man
michelet
was
in
the
right
path
when
he
came
in
contact
with
the
fistula
of
louis
but
he
fell
back
into
the
old
rut
almost
immediately
afterwards
after
this
judicious
expression
of
opinion
the
young
physiologist
went
to
join
a
party
of
passing
friends
the
two
archivists
less
well
acquainted
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
garden
so
far
from
the
rue
remained
together
and
began
to
chat
about
their
studies
gelis
who
had
completed
his
third
was
preparing
a
thesis
on
the
subject
of
which
he
expatiated
with
youthful
enthusiasm
indeed
i
thought
the
subject
a
very
good
one
particularly
because
i
had
recently
thought
myself
called
upon
to
treat
a
notable
part
of
it
it
was
the
monasticon
gallicanum
the
young
erudite
i
give
him
the
name
as
a
presage
wanted
to
describe
all
the
engravings
made
about
for
the
work
which
dom
michel
germain
would
have
had
printed
but
for
the
one
irremediable
hindrance
which
is
rarely
foreseen
and
never
avoided
dom
michel
germain
would
have
had
printed
but
for
the
one
irremediable
hindrance
which
is
rarely
foreseen
and
never
avoided
dom
michel
germain
left
his
manuscript
complete
however
and
in
good
order
when
he
died
shall
i
be
able
to
do
as
much
with
mine
but
that
is
not
the
present
question
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
understand
monsieur
gelis
intends
to
devote
a
brief
archaeological
notice
to
each
of
the
abbeys
pictured
by
the
humble
engravers
of
dom
michel
germain
his
friend
asked
him
whether
he
was
acquainted
with
all
the
manuscripts
and
printed
documents
relating
to
the
subject
it
was
then
that
i
pricked
up
my
ears
they
spoke
at
first
of
original
sources
and
i
must
confess
they
did
so
in
a
satisfactory
manner
despite
their
innumerable
and
detestable
puns
then
they
began
to
speak
about
contemporary
studies
on
the
subject
have
you
read
asked
boulmier
the
notice
of
courajod
good
i
thought
to
myself
yes
replied
gelis
it
is
have
you
read
said
boulmier
the
article
of
tamisey
de
larroque
in
the
revue
des
questions
historiques
good
i
thought
to
myself
for
the
second
time
yes
replied
gelis
it
is
full
of
have
you
read
said
boulmier
the
tableau
des
abbayes
benedictines
en
by
sylvestre
bonnard
good
i
said
to
myself
for
the
third
time
mai
foi
no
replied
gelis
bonnard
is
an
idiot
turning
my
head
i
perceived
that
the
shadow
had
reached
the
place
where
i
was
sitting
it
was
growing
chilly
and
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
fool
i
was
to
have
remained
sitting
there
at
the
risk
of
getting
rheumatism
just
to
listen
to
the
impertinence
of
those
two
young
fellows
well
well
i
said
to
myself
as
i
got
up
let
this
prattling
fledgling
write
his
thesis
and
sustain
it
he
will
find
my
colleague
quicherat
or
some
other
professor
at
the
school
to
show
him
what
an
ignoramus
he
is
i
consider
him
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
rascal
and
really
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
what
he
said
about
michelet
awhile
ago
was
quite
insufferable
outrageous
to
talk
in
that
way
about
an
old
master
replete
with
genius
it
was
simply
abominable
april
therese
give
me
my
new
hat
my
best
and
my
but
therese
is
deaf
as
a
sack
of
charcoal
and
slow
as
justice
years
have
made
her
so
the
worst
is
that
she
thinks
she
can
hear
well
and
move
about
well
and
proud
of
her
sixty
years
of
upright
domesticity
she
serves
her
old
master
with
the
most
vigilant
despotism
what
did
i
tell
you
and
now
she
will
not
give
me
my
cane
for
fear
that
i
might
lose
it
it
is
true
that
i
often
forget
umbrellas
and
in
the
omnibuses
and
booksellers
shops
but
i
have
a
special
reason
for
wanting
to
take
out
with
me
my
old
cane
with
the
engraved
silver
head
representing
don
quixote
charging
a
windmill
lance
in
rest
while
sancho
panza
with
uplifted
arms
vainly
conjures
him
to
a
stop
that
cane
is
all
that
came
to
me
from
the
heritage
of
my
uncle
captain
victor
who
in
his
lifetime
resembled
don
quixote
much
more
than
sancho
panza
and
who
loved
blows
quite
as
much
as
most
people
fear
them
for
thirty
years
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
this
cane
upon
all
memorable
or
solemn
visits
which
i
make
and
those
two
figures
of
knight
and
squire
give
me
inspiration
and
counsel
i
imagine
i
can
hear
them
speak
don
quixote
says
think
well
about
great
things
and
know
that
thought
is
the
only
reality
in
this
world
lift
up
nature
to
thine
own
stature
and
let
the
whole
universe
be
for
thee
no
more
than
the
reflection
of
thine
own
heroic
soul
combat
for
honour
s
sake
that
alone
is
worthy
of
a
man
and
if
it
should
fall
thee
to
receive
wounds
shed
thy
blood
as
a
beneficent
dew
and
and
sancho
panza
says
to
me
in
his
turn
remain
just
what
heaven
made
thee
comrade
prefer
the
which
has
become
dry
in
thy
wallet
to
all
the
partridges
that
roast
in
the
kitchen
of
lords
obey
thy
master
whether
he
by
a
wise
man
or
a
fool
and
do
not
cumber
thy
brain
with
too
many
useless
things
fear
blows
tis
verily
tempting
god
to
seek
after
danger
but
if
the
incomparable
knight
and
his
matchless
squire
are
imagined
only
upon
this
cane
of
mine
they
are
realities
to
my
inner
conscience
within
every
one
of
us
there
lives
both
a
don
quixote
and
a
sancho
panza
to
whom
we
hearken
by
turns
and
though
sancho
most
persuades
us
it
is
don
quixote
that
we
find
ourselves
obliged
to
admire
but
a
truce
to
this
dotage
and
let
us
go
to
see
madame
de
gabry
about
some
matters
more
important
than
the
everyday
details
of
life
same
day
i
found
madame
de
gabry
dressed
in
black
just
buttoning
her
gloves
i
am
ready
she
said
ready
so
i
have
always
found
her
upon
any
occasion
of
doing
a
kindness
after
some
compliments
about
the
good
health
of
her
husband
who
was
taking
a
walk
at
the
time
we
descended
the
stairs
and
got
into
the
carriage
i
do
not
know
what
secret
influence
i
feared
to
dissipate
by
breaking
silence
but
we
followed
the
great
deserted
drives
without
speaking
looking
at
the
crosses
the
monumental
columns
and
the
mortuary
wreaths
awaiting
sad
purchasers
the
vehicle
at
last
halted
at
the
extreme
verge
of
the
land
of
the
living
before
the
gate
upon
which
words
of
hope
are
graven
follow
me
said
madame
de
gabry
whose
tall
stature
i
noticed
then
for
the
first
time
she
first
walked
down
an
alley
of
cypresses
and
then
took
a
very
narrow
path
contrived
between
the
tombs
finally
halting
before
a
plain
slab
she
said
to
me
it
is
and
she
knelt
down
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
beautiful
and
easy
manner
in
which
this
christian
woman
fell
upon
her
knees
leaving
the
folds
of
her
robe
to
spread
themselves
at
random
about
her
i
had
never
before
seen
any
lady
kneel
down
with
such
frankness
and
such
forgetfulness
of
self
except
two
fair
polish
exiles
one
evening
long
ago
in
a
deserted
church
in
paris
this
image
passed
like
a
flash
and
i
saw
only
the
sloping
stone
on
which
was
graven
the
name
of
clementine
what
i
then
felt
was
something
so
deep
and
vague
that
only
the
sound
of
some
rich
music
could
convey
the
idea
of
it
i
seemed
to
hear
instruments
of
celestial
sweetness
make
harmony
in
my
old
heart
with
the
solemn
accords
of
a
funeral
chant
there
seemed
to
mingle
the
subdued
melody
of
a
song
of
love
for
my
soul
blended
into
one
feeling
the
grave
sadness
of
the
present
with
the
familiar
graces
of
the
past
i
can
not
tell
whether
we
had
remained
a
long
time
at
the
tomb
of
clementine
before
madame
de
gabry
arose
we
passed
through
the
cemetery
again
without
speaking
to
each
other
only
when
we
found
ourselves
among
the
living
once
more
did
i
feel
able
to
speak
while
following
you
there
i
said
to
madame
de
gabry
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
those
angels
with
whom
we
are
said
to
meet
on
the
mysterious
confines
of
life
and
death
that
tomb
you
led
me
to
of
which
i
knew
nothing
as
i
know
nothing
or
scarcely
anything
concerning
her
whom
it
covers
brought
back
to
me
emotions
which
were
unique
in
my
life
and
which
seem
in
the
dullness
of
that
life
like
some
light
gleaming
upon
a
dark
road
the
light
recedes
farther
and
farther
away
as
the
journey
lengthens
i
have
now
almost
reached
the
bottom
of
the
last
slope
and
nevertheless
each
time
i
turn
to
look
back
i
see
the
glow
as
bright
as
ever
you
madame
who
knew
clementine
as
a
young
wife
and
mother
after
her
hair
had
become
grey
you
can
not
imagine
her
as
i
see
her
still
a
young
fair
girl
all
pink
and
white
since
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
be
my
guide
dear
madame
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
feelings
were
awakened
in
me
by
the
sight
of
that
grave
to
which
you
led
me
memories
throng
back
upon
me
i
feel
myself
like
some
old
gnarled
and
mossy
oak
which
awakens
a
nestling
world
of
birds
by
shaking
its
branches
unfortunately
the
song
my
birds
sing
is
old
as
the
world
and
can
amuse
no
one
but
tell
me
your
souvenirs
said
madame
de
gabry
i
can
not
read
your
books
because
they
are
written
only
for
scholars
but
i
like
very
much
to
have
you
talk
to
me
because
you
know
how
to
give
interest
to
the
most
ordinary
things
in
life
and
talk
to
me
just
as
you
would
talk
to
an
old
woman
this
morning
i
found
three
grey
threads
in
my
let
them
come
without
regret
madame
i
replied
time
deals
gently
only
with
those
who
take
it
gently
and
when
in
some
years
more
you
will
have
a
silvery
fringe
under
your
black
fillet
you
will
be
reclothed
with
a
new
beauty
less
vivid
but
more
touching
than
the
first
and
you
will
find
your
husband
admiring
your
grey
tresses
as
much
as
he
did
that
black
curl
which
you
gave
him
when
about
to
be
married
and
which
he
preserves
in
a
locket
as
a
thing
sacred
these
boulevards
are
broad
and
very
quiet
we
can
talk
at
our
ease
as
we
walk
along
i
will
tell
you
to
begin
with
how
i
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
clementine
s
father
but
you
must
not
expect
anything
extraordinary
or
anything
even
remarkable
you
would
be
greatly
deceived
monsieur
de
lessay
used
to
live
in
the
second
storey
of
an
old
house
in
the
avenue
de
l
observatoire
having
a
stuccoed
front
ornamented
with
antique
busts
and
a
large
unkept
garden
attached
to
it
that
facade
and
that
garden
were
the
first
images
my
perceived
and
they
will
be
the
last
no
doubt
which
i
still
see
through
my
closed
eyelids
when
the
inevitable
day
comes
for
it
was
in
that
house
that
i
was
born
it
was
in
that
garden
i
first
learned
while
playing
to
feel
and
know
some
particles
of
this
old
universe
magical
hours
sacred
hours
when
the
soul
all
fresh
from
the
making
first
discoveries
the
world
which
for
its
sake
seems
to
assume
such
caressing
brightness
such
mysterious
charm
and
that
madame
is
indeed
because
the
universe
itself
is
only
the
reflection
of
our
soul
my
mother
was
being
very
happily
constituted
she
rose
with
the
sun
like
the
birds
and
she
herself
resembled
the
birds
by
her
domestic
industry
by
her
maternal
instinct
by
her
perpetual
desire
to
sing
and
by
a
sort
of
brusque
grace
which
i
could
feel
the
of
very
well
even
as
a
child
she
was
the
soul
of
the
house
which
she
filled
with
her
systematic
and
joyous
activity
my
father
was
just
as
slow
as
she
was
brisk
i
can
recall
very
well
that
placid
face
of
his
over
which
at
times
an
ironical
smile
used
to
flit
he
was
fatigued
with
active
life
and
he
loved
his
fatigue
seated
beside
the
fire
in
his
big
he
used
to
read
from
morning
till
night
and
it
is
from
him
that
i
inherit
my
love
of
books
i
have
in
my
library
a
mably
and
a
raynal
which
he
annotated
with
his
own
hand
from
beginning
to
end
but
it
was
utterly
useless
attempting
to
interest
him
in
anything
practical
whatever
when
my
mother
would
try
by
all
kinds
of
gracious
little
ruses
to
lure
him
out
of
his
retirement
he
would
simply
shake
his
head
with
that
inexorable
gentleness
which
is
the
force
of
weak
characters
he
used
in
this
way
greatly
to
worry
the
poor
woman
who
could
not
enter
at
all
into
his
own
sphere
of
meditative
wisdom
and
could
understand
nothing
of
life
except
its
daily
duties
and
the
merry
labour
of
each
hour
she
thought
him
sick
and
feared
he
was
going
to
become
still
more
so
but
his
apathy
had
a
different
cause
my
father
entering
the
naval
office
under
monsieur
decres
in
gave
early
proof
of
high
administrative
talent
there
was
a
great
deal
of
activity
in
the
marine
department
in
those
times
and
in
my
father
was
appointed
chief
of
the
second
administrative
division
that
same
year
the
emperor
whose
attention
had
been
called
to
him
by
the
minister
ordered
him
to
make
a
report
upon
the
organisation
of
the
english
navy
this
work
which
reflected
a
profoundly
liberal
and
philosophic
spirit
of
which
the
editor
himself
was
unconscious
was
only
finished
in
about
eighteen
months
after
the
defeat
of
admiral
villeneuve
at
trafalgar
napoleon
who
from
that
disastrous
day
never
wanted
to
hear
the
word
ship
mentioned
in
his
presence
angrily
glanced
over
a
few
pages
of
the
memoir
and
then
threw
it
in
the
fire
vociferating
words
words
i
said
once
before
that
i
hated
my
father
was
told
afterwards
that
the
emperor
s
anger
was
so
intense
at
the
moment
that
he
stamped
the
manuscript
down
into
the
fire
with
his
at
all
events
it
was
his
habit
when
very
much
irritated
to
poke
down
the
fire
with
his
my
father
never
fully
recovered
from
this
disgrace
and
the
fruitlessness
of
all
his
efforts
towards
reform
was
certainly
the
cause
of
the
apathy
which
came
upon
him
at
a
later
day
nevertheless
napoleon
after
his
return
from
elba
sent
for
him
and
ordered
him
to
prepare
some
liberal
and
patriotic
bulletins
and
proclamations
for
the
fleet
after
waterloo
my
father
whom
the
event
had
rather
saddened
than
surprised
retired
into
private
life
and
was
not
interfered
with
except
that
it
was
generally
averred
of
him
that
he
was
a
jacobin
a
one
of
those
men
with
whom
no
one
could
afford
to
be
on
intimate
terms
my
mother
s
eldest
brother
victor
maldent
and
infantry
captain
retired
on
in
and
disbanded
in
aggravated
by
his
bad
attitude
the
situation
in
which
the
fall
of
the
empire
had
placed
my
father
captain
victor
used
to
shout
in
the
cafes
and
the
public
balls
that
the
bourbons
had
sold
france
to
the
cossacks
he
used
to
show
everybody
a
tricoloured
cockade
hidden
in
the
lining
of
his
hat
and
carried
with
much
ostentation
a
the
handle
of
which
had
been
so
carved
that
the
shadow
thrown
by
it
made
the
silhouette
of
the
emperor
unless
you
have
seen
certain
lithographs
by
charlet
madame
you
could
form
no
idea
of
the
physiognomy
of
my
uncle
victor
when
he
used
to
stride
about
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
with
a
fiercely
elegant
manner
of
his
own
buttoned
up
in
his
frogged
coat
with
his
upon
his
breast
and
a
bouquet
of
violets
in
his
idleness
and
intemperance
greatly
intensified
the
vulgar
recklessness
of
his
political
passions
he
used
to
insult
people
whom
he
happened
to
see
reading
the
quotidienne
or
the
drapeau
blanc
and
compel
them
to
fight
with
him
in
this
way
he
had
the
pain
and
the
shame
of
wounding
a
boy
of
sixteen
in
a
duel
in
short
my
uncle
victor
was
the
very
reverse
of
a
person
and
as
he
came
to
lunch
and
dine
at
our
house
every
blessed
day
in
the
year
his
bad
reputation
became
attached
to
our
family
my
poor
father
suffered
cruelly
from
some
of
his
guest
s
pranks
but
being
very
he
never
made
any
remarks
and
continued
to
give
the
freedom
of
his
house
to
the
captain
who
only
despised
him
for
it
all
this
which
i
have
told
you
madame
was
explained
to
me
afterwards
but
at
the
time
in
question
my
uncle
the
captain
filled
me
with
the
very
enthusiasm
of
admiration
and
i
promised
myself
to
try
to
become
some
day
as
like
him
as
possible
so
one
fine
morning
in
order
to
begin
the
likeness
i
put
my
arms
akimbo
and
swore
like
a
trooper
my
excellent
mother
at
once
gave
me
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
i
remained
half
stupefied
for
some
little
while
before
i
could
even
burst
out
crying
i
can
still
see
the
old
covered
with
yellow
utrecht
velvet
behind
which
i
wept
innumerable
tears
that
day
i
was
a
very
little
fellow
then
one
morning
my
father
lifting
me
upon
his
knees
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
smiled
at
me
with
that
slightly
ironical
smile
which
gave
a
certain
piquancy
to
his
perpetual
gentleness
of
manner
as
i
sat
on
his
knee
playing
with
his
long
white
hair
he
told
me
something
which
i
did
not
understand
very
well
but
which
interested
me
very
much
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
mysterious
to
me
i
think
but
am
not
quite
sure
that
he
related
to
me
that
morning
the
story
of
the
little
king
of
yvetot
according
to
the
song
all
of
a
sudden
we
heard
a
great
report
and
the
windows
rattled
my
father
slipped
me
down
gently
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
he
threw
up
his
trembling
arms
with
a
strange
gesture
his
face
became
all
inert
and
white
and
his
eyes
seemed
enormous
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
teeth
were
chattering
at
last
he
murmured
they
have
shot
him
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
and
felt
only
a
vague
terror
i
knew
afterwards
however
that
hew
was
speaking
of
marshal
ney
who
fell
on
the
of
december
under
the
wall
enclosing
some
waste
ground
beside
our
house
about
that
time
i
used
often
to
meet
on
the
stairway
an
old
man
or
perhaps
not
exactly
an
old
man
with
little
black
eyes
which
flashed
with
extraordinary
vivacity
and
an
impassive
swarthy
face
he
did
not
seem
to
me
alive
or
at
least
he
did
not
seem
to
me
alive
in
the
same
way
that
other
men
are
alive
i
had
once
seen
at
the
residence
of
monsieur
denon
where
my
father
had
taken
me
with
him
on
a
visit
a
mummy
brought
from
egypt
and
i
believed
in
good
faith
that
monsieur
denon
s
mummy
used
to
get
up
when
no
one
was
looking
leave
its
gilded
case
put
on
a
brown
coat
and
powdered
wig
and
become
transformed
into
monsieur
de
lessay
and
even
dear
madame
while
i
reject
that
opinion
as
being
without
foundation
i
must
confess
that
monsieur
de
lessay
bore
a
very
strong
resemblance
to
monsieur
denon
s
mummy
the
fact
is
enough
to
explain
why
this
person
inspired
me
with
fantastic
terror
in
reality
monsieur
de
lessay
was
a
small
gentleman
and
a
great
philosopher
as
a
disciple
of
mably
and
rousseau
he
flattered
himself
on
being
a
man
without
any
prejudices
and
this
pretension
itself
is
a
very
great
prejudice
he
professed
to
hate
fanaticism
yet
was
himself
a
fanatic
on
the
topic
of
toleration
i
am
telling
you
madame
about
a
character
belonging
to
an
age
that
is
past
i
fear
i
may
not
be
able
to
make
you
understand
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
be
able
to
interest
you
it
was
so
long
ago
but
i
will
abridge
as
much
as
possible
besides
i
did
not
promise
you
anything
interesting
and
you
could
not
have
expected
to
hear
of
remarkable
adventures
in
the
life
of
sylvestre
madame
de
gabry
encouraged
me
to
proceed
and
i
resumed
monsieur
de
lessay
was
brusque
with
men
and
courteous
to
ladies
he
used
to
kiss
the
hand
of
my
mother
whom
the
customs
of
the
republic
and
the
empire
had
not
habituated
to
such
gallantry
in
him
i
touched
the
age
of
louis
xvi
monsieur
de
lessay
was
a
geographer
and
nobody
i
believe
ever
showed
more
pride
then
he
in
occupying
himself
with
the
face
of
the
earth
under
the
old
regime
he
had
attempted
philosophical
agriculture
and
thus
squandered
his
estates
to
the
very
last
acre
when
he
had
ceased
to
own
one
square
foot
of
ground
he
took
possession
of
the
whole
globe
and
prepared
an
extraordinary
number
of
maps
based
upon
the
narratives
of
travellers
but
as
he
had
been
mentally
nourished
with
the
very
marrow
of
the
encyclopedie
he
was
not
satisfied
with
merely
parking
off
human
beings
within
so
many
degrees
minutes
and
seconds
of
latitude
and
longitude
he
also
occupied
himself
alas
with
the
question
of
their
happiness
it
is
worthy
of
remark
madame
that
those
who
have
given
themselves
the
most
concern
about
the
happiness
of
peoples
have
made
their
neighbors
very
miserable
monsieur
de
lessay
who
was
more
of
a
geometrician
than
d
alembert
and
more
of
a
philosopher
than
jean
jacques
was
also
more
of
a
royalist
than
louis
xviii
but
his
love
for
the
king
was
nothing
to
his
hate
for
the
emperor
he
had
joined
the
conspiracy
of
georges
against
the
first
consul
but
in
the
framing
of
the
indictment
he
was
not
included
among
the
inculpated
parties
having
been
either
ignored
or
despised
and
this
injury
he
never
could
forgive
bonaparte
whom
he
called
the
ogre
of
corsica
and
to
whom
he
used
to
say
he
would
never
have
confided
even
the
command
of
a
regiment
so
pitiful
a
soldier
he
judged
him
to
be
in
monsieur
de
lessay
who
had
then
been
a
widower
for
many
years
married
again
at
the
age
of
sixty
a
very
young
woman
whom
he
pitilessly
kept
at
work
preparing
maps
for
him
and
who
gave
him
a
daughter
some
years
after
their
marriage
and
died
in
childbed
my
mother
had
nursed
her
during
her
brief
illness
and
had
taken
care
of
the
child
the
name
of
that
child
was
clementine
it
was
from
the
time
of
that
birth
and
that
death
that
the
relations
between
our
family
and
monsieur
de
lessay
began
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
been
growing
dull
as
i
began
to
leave
my
true
childhood
behind
me
i
had
lost
the
charming
power
of
being
able
to
see
and
feel
and
things
no
longer
caused
me
those
delicious
surprises
which
form
the
enchantment
of
the
more
tender
age
for
the
same
reason
perhaps
i
have
no
distinct
remembrance
of
the
period
following
the
birth
of
clementine
i
only
know
that
a
few
months
afterwards
i
had
a
misfortune
the
mere
thought
of
which
still
wrings
my
heart
i
lost
my
mother
a
great
silence
a
great
coldness
and
a
great
darkness
seemed
all
at
once
to
fill
the
house
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
torpor
my
father
sent
me
to
the
lycee
but
i
could
only
arouse
myself
from
my
lethargy
with
the
greatest
of
effort
still
i
was
not
altogether
a
dullard
and
my
professors
were
able
to
teach
me
almost
everything
they
wanted
namely
a
little
greek
and
a
great
deal
of
latin
my
acquaintances
were
confined
to
the
ancients
i
learned
to
esteem
miltiades
and
to
admire
themistocles
i
became
familiar
with
quintus
fabius
as
far
at
least
as
it
was
possible
to
become
familiar
with
so
great
a
consul
proud
of
these
lofty
acquaintances
i
scarcely
ever
condescended
to
notice
little
clementine
and
her
old
father
who
in
any
event
went
away
to
normandy
one
fine
morning
without
my
having
deigned
to
give
a
moment
s
thought
to
their
possible
return
they
came
back
however
madame
they
came
back
influences
of
heaven
forces
of
nature
all
ye
mysterious
powers
which
vouchsafe
to
man
the
ability
to
love
you
know
how
i
again
beheld
clementine
they
our
melancholy
home
monsieur
de
lessay
no
longer
wore
a
wig
bald
with
a
few
grey
locks
about
his
ruddy
temples
he
had
all
the
aspect
of
robust
old
age
but
that
divine
being
whom
i
saw
all
resplendent
as
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
she
whose
presence
illuminated
the
old
faded
parlour
she
was
not
an
apparition
it
was
clementine
herself
i
am
speaking
the
simple
truth
her
violet
eyes
seemed
to
me
in
that
moment
supernatural
and
even
i
can
not
imagine
how
those
two
living
jewels
could
have
endured
the
fatigues
of
life
or
become
subjected
to
the
corruption
of
death
she
betrayed
a
little
shyness
in
greeting
my
father
whom
she
did
not
remember
her
complexion
was
slightly
pink
and
her
lips
smiled
with
that
smile
which
makes
one
think
of
the
infinite
perhaps
because
it
betrays
no
particular
thought
and
expresses
only
the
joy
of
living
and
the
bliss
of
being
beautiful
under
a
pink
hood
her
face
shone
like
a
gem
in
an
open
casket
she
wore
a
cashmere
scarf
over
a
robe
of
white
muslin
plaited
at
the
waist
from
beneath
which
protruded
the
tip
of
a
little
morocco
shoe
oh
you
must
not
make
fun
of
me
dear
madame
that
was
the
fashion
of
the
time
and
i
do
not
know
whether
our
new
fashions
have
nearly
so
much
simplicity
brightness
and
decorous
grace
monsieur
de
lessay
informed
us
that
in
consequence
of
having
undertaken
the
publication
of
a
historical
atlas
he
had
come
back
to
live
in
paris
and
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
occupy
his
former
apartment
if
it
was
still
vacant
my
father
asked
mademoiselle
de
lessay
whether
she
was
pleased
to
visit
the
capital
she
appeared
to
be
for
her
smile
blossomed
out
in
reply
she
smiled
at
the
windows
that
looked
out
upon
the
green
and
luminous
garden
she
smiled
at
the
bronze
marius
seated
among
the
ruins
of
carthage
above
the
dial
of
the
clock
she
smiled
a
the
old
and
at
the
poor
student
who
was
afraid
to
lift
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
from
that
day
how
i
loved
her
but
here
we
are
already
a
the
rue
de
severs
and
in
a
little
while
we
shall
be
in
sight
of
your
windows
i
am
a
very
bad
and
if
i
were
by
some
impossible
chance
to
take
it
into
my
head
to
compose
a
novel
i
know
i
should
never
succeed
i
have
been
drawing
out
to
tiresome
length
a
narrative
which
i
must
finish
briefly
for
there
is
a
certain
delicacy
a
certain
grace
of
soul
which
an
old
man
could
not
help
offending
by
an
complacent
expatiation
upon
the
sentiments
of
even
the
purest
love
let
us
take
a
short
turn
on
this
boulevard
lined
with
convents
and
my
recital
will
be
easily
finished
within
the
distance
separating
us
from
that
little
spire
you
see
over
there
monsieur
de
lessay
on
finding
that
i
had
graduated
at
the
ecole
des
chartes
judged
me
worthy
to
assist
him
in
preparing
his
historical
atlas
the
plan
was
to
illustrate
by
a
series
of
maps
what
the
old
philosopher
termed
the
vicissitudes
of
empires
from
the
time
of
noah
down
to
that
of
charlemagne
monsieur
de
lessay
had
stored
up
in
his
head
all
the
errors
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
regard
to
antiquity
i
belonged
so
far
as
my
historical
studies
were
concerned
to
the
new
school
and
i
was
just
at
that
age
when
one
does
not
know
how
to
dissemble
the
manner
in
which
the
old
man
understood
or
rather
misunderstood
the
epoch
of
the
barbarians
his
obstinate
determination
to
find
in
remote
antiquity
only
ambitious
princes
hypocritical
and
avaricious
prelates
virtuous
citizens
and
other
personages
who
never
existed
outside
of
the
novels
of
marmontel
made
me
dreadfully
unhappy
and
at
first
used
to
excite
me
into
attempts
at
argument
rational
enough
but
perfectly
useless
and
sometimes
dangerous
for
monsieur
de
lessay
was
very
irascible
and
clementine
was
very
beautiful
between
her
and
him
i
passed
many
hours
of
torment
and
of
delight
i
was
in
love
i
was
a
coward
and
i
granted
to
him
all
that
he
demanded
of
me
in
regard
to
the
political
and
historical
aspect
which
the
earth
that
was
at
a
later
day
to
bear
clementine
presented
in
the
time
of
abraham
of
menes
and
of
deucalion
as
fast
as
we
drew
our
maps
mademoiselle
de
lessay
tinted
them
in
bending
over
the
table
she
held
the
brush
lightly
between
two
fingers
the
shadow
of
her
eyelashes
descended
upon
her
cheeks
and
bather
her
eyes
in
a
delicious
penumbra
sometimes
she
would
lift
her
head
and
i
would
see
her
lips
pout
there
was
so
much
expression
in
her
beauty
that
she
could
not
breathe
without
seeming
to
sigh
and
her
most
ordinary
poses
used
to
throw
me
into
the
deepest
ecstasies
of
admiration
whenever
i
gazed
at
her
i
fully
agreed
with
monsieur
de
lessay
that
jupiter
had
once
reigned
as
a
over
the
mountainous
regions
of
thessaly
and
that
orpheus
had
committed
the
imprudence
of
leaving
the
teaching
of
philosophy
to
the
clergy
i
am
not
now
quite
sure
whether
i
was
a
coward
or
a
hero
when
i
accorded
al
this
to
the
obstinate
old
man
mademoiselle
de
lessay
i
must
acknowledge
paid
very
little
attention
to
me
but
this
indifference
seemed
to
me
so
just
and
so
natural
that
i
never
even
dreamed
of
thinking
i
had
a
right
to
complain
about
it
it
made
me
unhappy
but
without
my
knowing
that
i
was
unhappy
at
the
time
i
was
hopeful
we
had
then
only
got
as
far
as
the
first
assyrian
empire
monsieur
de
lessay
came
every
evening
to
take
coffee
with
my
father
i
do
not
know
how
they
became
such
friends
for
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
two
characters
more
oppositely
constituted
my
father
was
a
man
who
admired
very
few
things
but
was
still
capable
of
excusing
a
great
many
still
as
he
grew
older
he
evinced
more
and
more
dislike
of
everything
in
the
shape
of
exaggeration
he
clothed
his
ideas
with
a
thousand
delicate
shades
of
expression
and
never
pronounced
an
opinion
without
all
sorts
of
reservations
these
conversational
habits
natural
to
a
finely
trained
mind
used
greatly
to
irritate
the
dry
terse
old
aristocrat
who
was
never
in
the
least
disarmed
by
the
moderation
of
an
adversary
quite
the
contrary
i
always
foresaw
one
danger
that
danger
was
bonaparte
my
father
had
not
himself
retained
an
particular
affection
for
his
memory
but
having
worked
under
his
direction
he
did
not
like
to
hear
him
abused
especially
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
against
whom
he
had
serious
reason
to
feel
resentment
monsieur
de
lessay
more
of
a
voltairean
and
a
legitimist
than
ever
now
traced
back
to
bonaparte
the
origin
of
every
social
political
and
religious
evil
such
being
the
situation
the
idea
of
uncle
victor
made
me
feel
particularly
uneasy
this
terrible
uncle
had
become
absolutely
unsufferable
now
that
his
sister
was
no
longer
there
to
calm
him
down
the
harp
of
david
was
broken
and
saul
was
wholly
delivered
over
to
the
spirit
of
madness
the
fall
of
charles
had
increased
the
audacity
of
the
old
napoleonic
veteran
who
uttered
all
imaginable
bravadoes
he
no
longer
frequented
our
house
which
had
become
too
silent
for
him
but
sometimes
at
the
we
would
see
him
suddenly
make
his
appearance
all
covered
with
flowers
like
a
mausoleum
ordinarily
he
would
sit
down
to
table
with
an
oath
growled
out
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
chest
and
brag
between
every
two
mouthfuls
of
his
good
fortune
with
the
ladies
as
a
vieux
brave
then
when
the
dinner
was
over
he
would
fold
up
his
napkin
in
the
shape
of
a
bishop
s
mitre
gulp
down
half
a
decanter
of
brandy
and
rush
away
with
the
hurried
air
of
a
man
terrified
at
the
mere
idea
of
remaining
for
any
length
of
time
without
drinking
in
conversation
with
an
old
philosopher
and
a
young
scholar
i
felt
perfectly
sure
that
if
ever
he
and
monsieur
de
lessay
should
come
together
all
would
be
lost
but
that
day
came
madame
the
captain
was
almost
hidden
by
flowers
that
day
and
seemed
so
much
like
a
monument
commemorating
the
glories
of
the
empire
that
one
would
have
liked
to
pass
a
garland
of
immortelles
over
each
of
his
arms
he
was
in
an
extraordinarily
good
humour
and
the
first
person
to
profit
by
that
good
humour
was
our
cook
for
he
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
while
she
was
placing
the
roast
on
the
table
after
dinner
he
pushed
away
the
decanter
presented
to
him
observing
that
he
was
going
to
burn
some
brandy
in
his
coffee
later
on
i
asked
him
tremblingly
whether
he
would
not
prefer
to
have
his
coffee
at
once
he
was
very
suspicious
and
not
at
all
dull
of
comprehension
my
uncle
victor
my
precipitation
seemed
to
him
in
very
bad
taste
for
he
looked
at
me
in
a
peculiar
way
and
said
patience
my
nephew
it
isn
t
the
business
of
the
baby
of
the
regiment
to
sound
the
retreat
devil
take
it
you
must
be
in
a
great
hurry
master
pedant
to
see
if
i
ve
got
spurs
on
my
boots
it
was
evident
the
captain
had
divined
that
i
wanted
him
to
go
and
i
knew
him
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
was
going
to
stay
he
stayed
the
least
circumstances
of
that
evening
remain
impressed
on
my
memory
my
uncle
was
extremely
jovial
the
mere
idea
of
being
in
somebody
s
way
was
enough
to
keep
him
in
good
humour
he
told
us
in
regular
barrack
style
ma
foi
a
certain
story
about
a
monk
a
trumpet
and
five
bottles
of
chambertin
which
must
have
been
much
enjoyed
in
the
garrison
society
but
which
i
would
not
venture
to
repeat
to
you
madame
even
if
i
could
remember
it
when
we
passed
into
the
parlour
the
captain
called
attention
to
the
bad
condition
of
our
andirons
and
learnedly
discoursed
on
the
merits
of
as
a
not
a
word
on
the
subject
of
politics
he
was
husbanding
his
forces
eight
o
clock
sounded
from
the
ruins
of
carthage
on
the
mantlepiece
it
was
monsieur
de
lessay
s
hour
a
few
moments
later
he
entered
the
parlour
with
his
daughter
the
ordinary
evening
chat
began
clementine
sat
down
and
began
to
work
on
some
embroidery
beside
the
lamp
whose
shade
left
her
pretty
head
in
a
soft
shadow
and
threw
down
upon
her
fingers
a
radiance
that
made
them
seem
almost
monsieur
de
lessay
spoke
of
a
comet
announced
by
the
astronomers
and
developed
some
theories
in
relation
to
the
subject
which
however
audacious
betrayed
at
least
a
certain
degree
of
intellectual
culture
my
father
who
knew
a
good
deal
about
astronomy
advanced
some
sound
ideas
of
his
own
which
he
ended
up
with
his
eternal
but
what
do
we
know
about
it
after
all
in
my
turn
i
cited
the
opinion
of
our
neighbour
of
the
observatory
the
great
arago
my
uncle
victor
declared
that
comets
had
a
peculiar
influence
on
the
quality
of
wines
and
related
in
support
of
this
view
a
jolly
i
was
so
delighted
with
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
that
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
maintain
it
in
the
same
groove
with
the
help
of
my
most
recent
studies
by
a
long
exposition
of
the
chemical
composition
of
those
nebulous
bodies
which
although
extending
over
a
length
of
billions
of
leagues
could
be
contained
in
a
small
bottle
my
father
a
little
surprised
at
my
unusual
eloquence
watched
me
with
his
peculiar
placid
ironical
smile
but
one
can
not
always
remain
in
heaven
i
spoke
as
i
looked
at
clementine
of
a
certain
comete
of
diamonds
which
i
had
been
admiring
in
a
jeweller
s
window
the
evening
before
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
inspiration
of
mine
ah
my
nephew
cried
uncle
victor
that
comete
of
yours
was
nothing
to
the
one
which
the
empress
josephine
wore
in
her
hair
when
she
came
to
strasburg
to
distribute
crosses
to
the
that
little
josephine
was
very
fond
of
finery
and
display
observed
monsieur
de
lessay
between
two
sips
of
coffee
i
do
not
blame
her
for
it
she
had
good
qualities
though
rather
frivolous
in
character
she
was
a
tascher
and
she
conferred
a
great
honour
on
bonaparte
by
marrying
him
to
say
a
tascher
does
not
of
course
mean
a
great
deal
but
to
say
a
bonaparte
simply
means
nothing
at
what
do
you
mean
by
that
monsieur
the
marquis
demanded
captain
victor
i
am
not
a
marquis
dryly
responded
monsieur
de
lessay
and
i
mean
simply
that
bonaparte
would
have
been
very
well
suited
had
he
married
one
of
those
cannibal
women
described
by
captain
cook
in
his
voyages
naked
tattooed
with
a
ring
in
her
nose
devouring
with
delight
putrefied
human
i
had
foreseen
it
and
in
my
anguish
o
pitiful
human
heart
my
first
idea
was
about
the
remarkable
exactness
of
my
anticipations
i
must
say
that
the
captain
s
reply
belonged
to
the
sublime
order
he
put
his
arms
akimbo
eyed
monsieur
de
lessay
contemptuously
from
head
to
food
and
said
napoleon
monsieur
the
vidame
had
another
spouse
besides
josephine
another
spouse
besides
that
companion
you
know
nothing
of
but
i
have
seen
her
close
to
me
she
wears
a
mantle
of
azure
gemmed
with
stars
she
is
crowned
with
laurels
the
flames
upon
her
breast
her
name
is
glory
monsieur
de
lessay
set
his
cup
on
the
mantlepiece
and
quietly
observed
your
bonaparte
was
a
blackguard
my
father
rose
up
calmly
extended
his
arm
and
said
very
softly
to
monsieur
de
lessay
whatever
the
man
was
who
died
at
helena
i
worked
for
ten
years
in
his
government
and
my
was
three
times
wounded
under
his
eagles
i
beg
of
you
dear
sir
and
friend
never
to
forget
these
facts
in
what
the
sublime
and
burlesque
insolence
of
the
captain
could
not
do
the
courteous
remonstrance
of
my
father
effected
immediately
throwing
monsieur
de
lessay
into
a
furious
passion
i
did
forget
he
exclaimed
between
his
set
teeth
livid
in
his
rage
and
fairly
foaming
at
the
mouth
the
always
smells
of
herring
and
when
one
has
been
in
the
service
of
rascals
as
he
uttered
the
word
the
captain
sprang
at
his
throat
i
am
sure
he
would
have
strangled
him
upon
the
spot
but
for
his
daughter
and
me
my
father
a
little
paler
than
his
wont
stood
there
with
his
arms
folded
and
watched
the
scene
with
a
look
of
inexpressible
pity
what
followed
was
still
more
lamentable
but
why
dwell
further
upon
the
folly
of
two
old
men
finally
i
succeeded
in
separating
them
monsieur
de
lessay
made
a
sign
to
his
daughter
and
left
the
room
as
she
was
following
him
i
ran
out
into
the
stairway
after
her
mademoiselle
i
said
to
her
wildly
taking
her
hand
as
i
spoke
i
love
you
i
love
you
for
a
moment
she
pressed
my
hand
her
lips
opened
what
was
it
that
she
was
going
to
say
to
me
but
suddenly
lifting
her
eyes
towards
her
father
ascending
the
stairs
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
made
me
a
gesture
of
farewell
i
never
saw
her
again
her
father
went
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pantheon
in
an
apartment
which
he
had
rented
for
the
sale
of
his
historical
atlas
he
died
in
a
few
months
afterward
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
his
daughter
i
was
told
retired
to
caen
to
live
with
some
aged
relative
it
was
there
that
later
on
she
married
a
the
same
noel
alexandre
who
became
so
rich
and
died
so
poor
as
for
me
madame
i
have
lived
alone
at
peace
with
myself
my
existence
equally
exempt
from
great
pains
and
great
joys
has
been
tolerably
happy
but
for
many
years
i
could
never
see
an
empty
chair
beside
my
own
of
a
winter
s
evening
without
feeling
a
sudden
painful
sinking
at
my
heart
last
year
i
learned
from
you
who
had
known
her
the
story
of
her
old
age
and
death
i
saw
her
daughter
at
your
house
i
have
seen
her
but
i
can
not
yet
say
like
the
aged
mad
of
scripture
and
now
o
lord
let
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
for
if
an
old
fellow
like
me
can
be
of
any
use
to
anybody
i
would
wish
with
your
help
to
devote
my
last
energies
and
abilities
to
the
care
of
this
i
had
uttered
these
last
words
in
madame
de
gabry
s
own
vestibule
and
i
was
about
to
take
leave
of
my
kind
guide
when
she
said
to
me
my
dear
monsieur
i
can
not
help
you
in
this
matter
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
do
jeanne
is
an
orphan
and
a
minor
you
can
not
do
anything
for
her
without
the
authorisation
of
her
ah
i
exclaimed
i
had
not
the
least
idea
in
the
wold
that
jeanne
had
a
guardian
madame
de
gabry
looked
at
me
with
visible
surprise
she
had
not
expected
to
find
the
old
man
quite
so
simple
she
resumed
the
guardian
of
jeanne
alexandre
is
maitre
mouche
notary
at
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
come
to
any
understanding
with
him
for
he
is
a
very
serious
why
good
god
i
cried
with
what
kind
of
people
can
you
expect
me
to
have
any
sort
of
understanding
at
my
age
except
serious
she
smiled
with
a
sweet
mischievousness
just
as
my
father
used
to
smile
and
answered
with
those
who
are
like
you
the
innocent
folks
who
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves
monsieur
mouche
is
not
exactly
that
kind
he
is
cunning
and
but
although
i
have
very
little
liking
for
him
we
will
go
together
and
see
him
if
you
wish
and
ask
his
permission
to
visit
jeanne
whom
he
has
sent
to
a
at
les
ternes
where
she
is
very
we
agreed
at
once
upon
a
day
i
kissed
madame
de
gabry
s
hands
and
we
bade
each
other
from
may
to
may
i
have
seen
him
in
his
office
maitre
mouche
the
guardian
of
jeanne
small
thin
and
dry
his
complexion
looks
as
if
it
was
made
out
of
the
dust
of
his
he
is
a
spectacled
animal
for
to
imagine
him
without
his
spectacles
would
be
impossible
i
have
heard
him
speak
this
maitre
mouche
he
has
a
voice
like
a
tin
rattle
and
he
uses
choice
phrases
but
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
he
had
not
chosen
his
phrases
so
carefully
i
have
observed
him
this
maitre
mouche
he
is
very
ceremonious
and
watches
his
visitors
slyly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
maitre
mouche
is
quite
pleased
he
informs
us
he
is
delighted
to
find
we
have
taken
such
an
interest
in
his
ward
but
he
does
not
think
we
are
placed
in
this
world
just
to
amuse
ourselves
no
he
does
not
believe
it
and
i
am
free
to
acknowledge
that
anybody
in
his
company
is
likely
to
reach
the
same
conclusion
so
little
is
he
capable
of
inspiring
joyfulness
he
fears
that
it
would
be
giving
his
dear
ward
a
false
and
pernicious
idea
of
life
to
allow
her
too
much
enjoyment
it
is
for
this
reason
that
he
requests
madame
de
gabry
not
to
invite
the
young
girl
to
her
house
except
at
very
long
intervals
we
left
the
dusty
notary
and
his
dusty
study
with
a
permit
in
due
form
everything
which
issues
from
the
office
of
maitre
mouche
is
in
due
form
to
visit
mademoiselle
jeanne
alexandre
on
the
first
thursday
of
each
month
at
mademoiselle
prefere
s
private
school
rue
demours
aux
ternes
the
first
thursday
in
may
i
set
out
to
pay
a
visit
to
mademoiselle
prefere
whose
establishment
i
discerned
from
afar
off
by
a
big
sign
painted
with
blue
letters
that
blue
tint
was
the
first
indication
i
received
of
mademoiselle
prefere
s
character
which
i
was
able
to
see
more
of
later
on
a
servant
took
my
card
and
abandoned
me
without
one
word
of
hope
at
the
door
of
a
chilly
parlour
full
of
that
stale
odour
peculiar
to
the
of
educational
establishments
the
floor
of
this
parlour
had
been
waxed
with
such
pitiless
energy
that
i
remained
for
awhile
in
distress
upon
the
threshold
but
happily
observing
that
little
strips
of
woollen
carpet
had
been
scattered
over
the
floor
in
front
of
each
chair
i
succeeded
by
cautiously
stepping
from
one
to
another
in
reaching
the
angle
of
the
mantlepiece
where
i
sat
down
quite
out
of
breath
over
the
mantelpiece
in
a
large
gilded
frame
was
a
written
document
entitled
in
flamboyant
gothic
lettering
tableau
d
honneur
with
a
long
array
of
names
underneath
among
which
i
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
of
jeanne
alexandre
after
having
read
over
several
times
the
names
of
those
who
had
thus
made
themselves
honoured
in
the
eyes
of
mademoiselle
prefere
i
began
to
feel
uneasy
at
not
hearing
any
one
coming
mademoiselle
prefere
would
certainly
have
succeeded
in
establishing
the
absolute
silence
of
interstellar
spaces
throughout
her
pedagogical
domains
had
it
not
been
that
the
sparrows
had
chosen
her
yard
to
assemble
in
by
legions
and
chirp
at
the
top
of
their
voices
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
them
but
there
was
no
way
of
seeing
them
through
the
windows
i
had
to
content
myself
with
the
sights
of
the
parlour
decorated
from
floor
to
ceiling
on
all
of
its
four
walls
with
drawings
executed
by
the
pupils
of
the
institution
there
were
vestals
flowers
thatched
cottages
and
an
enormous
head
of
tatius
king
of
the
sabines
bearing
the
signature
estelle
mouton
i
had
already
passed
some
time
in
admiring
the
energy
with
which
mademoiselle
mouton
had
delineated
the
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
fierce
gaze
of
the
antique
warrior
when
a
sound
faint
like
the
rustling
of
a
dead
leaf
moved
by
the
wind
caused
me
to
turn
my
head
it
was
not
a
dead
leaf
at
all
it
was
mademoiselle
prefere
with
hands
jointed
before
her
she
came
gliding
over
the
of
that
wonderful
floor
as
the
saints
of
the
golden
legend
were
wont
to
glide
over
the
crystal
surface
of
the
waters
but
upon
any
other
occasion
i
am
sure
mademoiselle
prefere
would
not
have
made
me
think
in
the
least
about
those
virgins
dear
to
mystical
fancy
her
face
rather
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
preserved
or
a
whole
winter
in
an
attic
by
some
economical
housekeeper
her
shoulders
were
covered
with
a
fringed
pelerine
which
had
nothing
at
all
remarkable
about
it
but
which
she
wore
as
if
it
were
a
sacerdotal
vestment
or
the
symbol
of
some
high
civic
function
i
explained
to
her
the
purpose
of
my
visit
and
gave
her
my
letter
of
introduction
ah
so
you
are
monsieur
mouche
she
exclaimed
is
his
health
very
good
he
is
the
most
upright
of
men
the
most
she
did
not
finish
the
phrase
but
raised
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
my
own
followed
the
direction
of
their
gaze
and
observed
a
little
spiral
of
paper
lace
suspended
from
the
place
of
the
chandelier
which
was
apparently
destined
so
far
as
i
could
discover
to
attract
the
flies
away
from
the
gilded
and
the
tableau
d
honneur
i
have
met
mademoiselle
jeanne
alexandre
i
observed
at
the
residence
of
madame
de
gabry
and
had
reason
to
appreciate
the
excellent
character
and
quick
intelligence
of
the
young
girl
as
i
used
to
know
her
parents
very
well
the
friendship
which
i
felt
for
them
naturally
inclines
me
to
take
an
interest
in
mademoiselle
prefere
in
lieu
of
making
any
reply
sighed
profoundly
pressed
her
mysterious
pelerine
to
her
heart
and
again
contemplated
the
paper
spiral
at
last
she
observed
since
you
were
once
the
friend
of
monsieur
and
madame
alexandre
i
hope
and
trust
that
like
monsieur
mouche
and
myself
you
deplore
those
crazy
speculations
which
led
them
to
ruin
and
reduced
their
daughter
to
absolute
poverty
i
thought
to
myself
on
hearing
these
words
how
very
wrong
it
is
to
be
unlucky
and
how
unpardonable
such
an
error
on
the
part
of
those
previously
in
a
position
worthy
of
envy
their
fall
at
once
avenges
and
flatters
us
and
we
are
wholly
pitiless
after
having
answered
very
frankly
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
history
of
the
bank
i
asked
the
schoolmistress
if
she
was
satisfied
with
mademoiselle
alexandre
that
child
is
indomitable
cried
mademoiselle
prefere
and
she
assumed
an
attitude
of
lofty
resignation
to
symbolise
the
difficult
situation
she
was
placed
in
by
a
pupil
so
hard
to
train
then
with
more
calmness
of
manner
she
added
the
young
person
is
not
unintelligent
but
she
can
not
resign
herself
to
learn
things
by
what
a
strange
old
maid
was
this
mademoiselle
prefere
she
walked
without
lifting
her
legs
and
spoke
without
moving
her
lips
without
however
considering
her
peculiarities
for
more
than
a
reasonable
instant
i
replied
that
principles
were
no
doubt
very
excellent
things
and
that
i
could
trust
myself
to
her
judgement
in
regard
to
their
value
but
that
after
all
when
one
had
learned
something
it
very
little
difference
what
method
had
been
followed
in
the
learning
of
it
mademoiselle
made
a
slow
gesture
of
dissent
then
with
a
sigh
she
declared
ah
monsieur
those
who
do
not
understand
educational
methods
are
apt
to
have
very
false
ideas
on
these
subjects
i
am
certain
they
express
their
opinions
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
but
they
would
do
better
a
great
deal
better
to
leave
all
such
questions
to
competent
i
did
not
attempt
to
argue
further
and
simply
asked
her
whether
i
could
see
mademoiselle
alexandre
at
once
she
looked
at
her
pelerine
as
if
trying
to
read
in
the
entanglements
of
its
fringes
as
in
a
conjuring
book
what
sort
of
answer
she
ought
to
make
then
said
mademoiselle
alexandre
has
a
penance
to
perform
and
a
to
give
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
let
you
put
yourself
to
the
trouble
of
coming
here
all
to
no
purpose
i
am
going
to
send
for
her
only
first
allow
me
monsieur
as
is
our
custom
to
put
your
name
on
the
visitors
she
sat
down
at
the
table
opened
a
large
copybook
and
taking
out
maitre
mouche
s
letter
again
from
under
her
pelerine
where
she
had
placed
it
looked
at
it
and
began
to
write
bonnard
with
a
d
is
it
not
she
asked
excuse
me
for
being
so
particular
but
my
opinion
is
that
proper
names
have
an
orthography
we
have
in
proper
names
monsieur
at
this
school
historical
proper
names
of
course
after
i
had
written
down
my
name
in
a
running
hand
she
inquired
whether
she
should
not
put
down
after
it
my
profession
title
quality
such
as
retired
merchant
employe
independent
gentleman
or
something
else
there
was
a
column
in
her
register
expressly
for
that
purpose
my
goodness
madame
i
said
if
you
must
absolutely
fill
that
column
of
yours
put
down
member
of
the
it
was
still
mademoiselle
prefere
s
pelerine
i
saw
before
me
but
it
was
not
mademoiselle
prefere
who
wore
it
it
was
a
totally
different
person
obliging
gracious
caressing
radiant
happy
her
eyes
smiled
the
little
wrinkles
of
her
face
there
were
a
vast
number
of
them
also
smiled
her
mouth
smiled
likewise
but
only
on
one
side
i
discovered
afterwards
that
was
her
best
side
she
spoke
her
voice
had
also
changed
with
her
manner
it
was
now
sweet
as
honey
you
said
monsieur
that
our
dear
jeanne
was
very
intelligent
i
discovered
the
same
thing
myself
and
i
am
proud
of
being
able
to
agree
with
you
this
young
girl
has
really
made
me
feel
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
her
she
has
what
i
call
a
happy
disposition
but
excuse
me
for
thus
drawing
upon
your
valuable
she
summoned
the
who
looked
much
more
hurried
and
scared
than
before
and
who
vanished
with
the
order
to
go
and
tell
mademoiselle
alexandre
that
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
member
of
the
institute
was
waiting
to
see
her
in
the
parlour
mademoiselle
prefere
had
barely
time
to
confide
in
me
that
she
had
the
most
profound
respect
for
all
decisions
of
the
institute
whatever
they
might
be
when
jeanne
appeared
out
of
breath
red
as
a
poppy
with
her
eyes
very
wide
open
and
her
arms
dangling
helplessly
at
her
sides
charming
in
her
artless
awkwardness
what
a
state
you
are
in
my
dear
child
murmured
mademoiselle
prefere
with
maternal
sweetness
as
she
arranged
the
girl
s
collar
jeanne
certainly
did
present
an
odd
aspect
her
hair
combed
back
and
imperfectly
held
by
a
net
from
which
loose
curls
were
escaping
her
slender
arms
sheathed
down
to
the
elbows
in
lustring
sleeves
her
hands
which
she
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
all
red
with
chillblains
her
dress
much
too
short
revealing
that
she
had
on
stockings
much
too
large
for
her
and
shoes
worn
down
at
the
heel
and
a
tied
round
her
waist
in
lieu
of
a
belt
all
combined
to
lend
mademoiselle
jeanne
an
appearance
the
reverse
of
presentable
oh
you
crazy
girl
sighed
mademoiselle
prefere
who
now
seemed
no
longer
like
a
mother
but
rather
like
an
elder
sister
then
she
suddenly
left
the
room
gliding
like
a
shadow
over
the
polished
floor
i
said
to
jeanne
sit
down
jeanne
and
talk
to
me
as
you
would
to
a
friend
are
you
not
better
satisfied
here
now
than
you
were
last
year
she
hesitated
then
answered
with
a
smile
of
resignation
not
much
i
asked
her
to
tell
me
about
her
school
life
she
began
at
once
to
enumerate
all
her
different
studies
piano
style
chronology
of
the
kings
of
france
sewing
drawing
catechism
deportment
i
could
never
remember
them
all
she
still
held
in
her
hands
all
unconsciously
the
two
ends
of
her
and
she
raised
and
lowered
them
regularly
while
making
her
enumeration
then
all
at
once
she
became
conscious
of
what
she
was
doing
blushed
stammered
and
became
so
confused
that
i
had
to
renounce
my
desire
to
know
the
full
programme
of
study
adopted
in
the
prefere
institution
after
having
questioned
jeanne
on
various
matters
and
obtained
only
the
vaguest
of
answers
i
perceived
that
her
young
mind
was
totally
absorbed
by
the
and
i
entered
bravely
into
that
grave
subject
so
you
have
been
skipping
i
said
it
is
a
very
nice
amusement
but
one
that
you
must
not
exert
yourself
too
much
at
for
any
excessive
exercise
of
that
kind
might
seriously
injure
your
health
and
i
should
be
very
much
grieved
about
it
jeanne
i
should
be
very
much
grieved
indeed
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
the
young
girl
said
to
have
come
to
see
me
and
talk
to
me
like
this
i
did
not
think
about
thanking
you
when
i
came
in
because
i
was
too
much
surprised
have
you
seen
madame
de
gabry
please
tell
me
something
about
her
madame
de
gabry
i
answered
is
very
well
i
can
only
tell
you
about
her
jeanne
what
an
old
gardener
once
said
of
the
lady
of
the
castle
his
mistress
when
somebody
anxiously
inquired
about
her
madame
is
in
her
yes
madame
de
gabry
is
in
her
own
road
and
you
know
jeanne
what
a
good
road
it
is
and
how
steadily
she
can
walk
upon
it
i
went
out
with
her
the
other
day
very
very
far
away
from
the
house
and
we
talked
about
you
we
talked
about
you
my
child
at
your
mother
s
i
am
very
glad
said
jeanne
and
then
all
at
once
she
began
to
cry
i
felt
too
much
reverence
for
those
generous
tears
to
attempt
in
any
way
to
check
the
emotion
that
had
evoked
them
but
in
a
little
while
as
the
girl
wiped
her
eyes
i
asked
her
will
you
not
tell
me
jeanne
why
you
were
thinking
so
much
about
that
a
little
while
ago
why
indeed
i
will
monsieur
it
was
only
because
i
had
no
right
to
come
into
the
parlour
with
a
you
know
of
course
that
i
am
past
the
age
for
playing
at
skipping
but
when
the
servant
said
there
was
an
old
gentleman
oh
i
mean
that
a
gentleman
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
parlour
i
was
making
the
little
girls
jump
then
i
tied
the
rope
round
my
waist
in
a
hurry
so
that
it
might
not
get
lost
it
was
wrong
but
i
have
not
been
in
the
habit
of
having
many
people
come
to
see
me
and
mademoiselle
prefere
never
lets
us
off
if
we
commit
any
breach
of
deportment
so
i
know
she
is
going
to
punish
me
and
i
am
very
sorry
about
that
is
too
bad
jeanne
she
became
very
grave
and
said
yes
monsieur
it
is
too
bad
because
when
i
am
punished
myself
i
have
no
more
authority
over
the
little
i
did
not
at
once
fully
understand
the
nature
of
this
unpleasantness
but
jeanne
explained
to
me
that
as
she
was
charged
by
mademoiselle
prefere
with
the
duties
of
taking
care
of
the
youngest
class
of
washing
and
dressing
the
children
of
teaching
them
how
to
behave
how
to
sew
how
to
say
the
alphabet
of
showing
them
how
to
play
and
finally
of
putting
them
to
bed
at
the
close
of
the
day
she
could
not
make
herself
obeyed
by
those
turbulent
little
folks
on
the
days
she
was
condemned
to
wear
a
in
the
or
to
eat
her
meals
standing
up
from
a
plate
turned
upside
down
having
secretly
admired
the
punishments
devised
by
the
lady
of
the
enchanted
pelerine
i
responded
then
if
i
understand
you
rightly
jeanne
you
are
at
once
a
pupil
here
and
a
mistress
it
is
a
condition
of
existence
very
common
in
the
world
you
are
punished
and
you
punish
oh
monsieur
she
exclaimed
no
i
never
punish
then
i
suspect
said
i
that
your
indulgence
gets
you
many
scoldings
from
mademoiselle
prefere
she
smiled
and
blinked
then
i
said
to
her
that
the
troubles
in
which
we
often
involve
ourselves
by
trying
to
act
according
to
our
conscience
and
to
do
the
best
we
can
are
never
of
the
sort
that
totally
dishearten
and
weary
us
but
are
on
the
contrary
wholesome
trials
this
sort
of
philosophy
touched
her
very
little
she
even
appeared
totally
unmoved
by
my
moral
exhortations
but
was
not
this
quite
natural
on
her
part
and
ought
i
not
to
have
remembered
that
it
is
only
those
no
longer
innocent
who
can
find
pleasure
in
the
systems
of
moralists
i
had
at
least
good
sense
enough
to
cut
short
my
sermonising
jeanne
i
said
you
were
asking
a
moment
ago
about
madame
de
gabry
let
us
talk
about
that
fairy
of
yours
she
was
very
prettily
made
do
you
do
any
modelling
in
wax
now
i
have
not
a
bit
of
wax
she
exclaimed
wringing
her
hands
no
wax
at
all
no
wax
i
cried
in
a
republic
of
busy
bees
she
laughed
and
then
you
see
monsieur
my
figurines
as
you
call
them
are
not
in
mademoiselle
prefere
s
programme
but
i
had
begun
to
make
a
very
small
for
madame
de
gabry
a
tiny
little
with
a
golden
cuirass
is
not
that
right
monsieur
bonnard
to
give
a
gold
cuirass
quite
right
jeanne
but
what
became
of
it
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
kept
it
in
my
pocket
because
i
had
no
other
place
to
put
it
and
and
i
sat
down
on
it
by
she
drew
out
of
her
pocket
a
little
wax
figure
which
had
been
squeezed
out
of
all
resemblance
to
human
form
and
of
which
the
dislocated
limbs
were
only
attached
to
the
body
by
their
wire
framework
at
the
sight
of
her
hero
thus
marred
she
was
seized
at
once
with
compassion
and
gaiety
the
latter
feeling
obtained
the
mastery
and
she
burst
into
a
clear
laugh
which
however
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
mademoiselle
prefere
stood
at
the
parlour
door
smiling
that
dear
child
sighed
the
schoolmistress
in
her
tenderest
tone
i
am
afraid
she
will
tire
you
and
then
your
time
is
so
precious
i
begged
mademoiselle
prefere
to
dismiss
that
illusion
and
rising
to
take
my
leave
i
took
from
my
pocket
some
and
sweets
which
i
had
brought
with
me
that
is
so
nice
said
jeanne
there
will
be
enough
to
go
round
the
whole
the
lady
of
the
pelerine
intervened
mademoiselle
alexandre
she
said
thank
monsieur
for
his
jeanne
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
in
a
sullen
way
then
turning
to
me
said
with
remarkable
firmness
monsieur
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
in
coming
to
see
jeanne
i
said
pressing
both
her
hands
remain
always
a
good
truthful
brave
girl
as
she
left
the
room
with
her
packages
of
chocolate
and
confectionery
she
happened
to
strike
the
handles
of
her
against
the
back
of
a
chair
mademoiselle
prefere
full
of
indignation
pressed
both
hands
over
her
heart
under
her
pelerine
and
i
almost
expected
to
see
her
give
up
her
scholastic
ghost
when
we
found
ourselves
alone
she
recovered
her
composure
and
i
must
say
without
considering
myself
thereby
flattered
that
she
smiled
upon
me
with
one
whole
side
of
her
face
mademoiselle
i
said
taking
advantage
of
her
good
humour
i
noticed
that
jeanne
alexandre
looks
a
little
pale
you
know
better
than
i
how
much
consideration
and
care
a
young
girl
requires
at
her
age
it
would
only
be
doing
you
an
injustice
by
implication
to
recommend
her
still
more
earnestly
to
your
these
words
seemed
to
ravish
her
with
delight
she
lifted
her
eyes
as
in
ecstasy
to
the
paper
spirals
of
the
ceiling
and
clasping
her
hands
exclaimed
how
well
these
eminent
men
know
the
art
of
considering
the
most
trifling
details
i
called
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
health
of
a
young
girl
was
not
a
trifling
detail
and
made
my
farewell
bow
but
she
stopped
me
on
the
threshold
to
say
to
me
very
confidentially
you
must
excuse
me
monsieur
i
am
a
woman
and
i
love
glory
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
the
fact
that
i
feel
myself
greatly
honoured
by
the
presence
of
a
member
of
the
institute
in
my
humble
i
duly
excused
the
weakness
of
mademoiselle
prefere
and
thinking
only
of
jeanne
with
the
blindness
of
egotism
kept
asking
myself
all
along
the
road
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this
child
june
i
had
escorted
to
the
cimetiere
de
marnes
that
day
a
very
aged
colleague
of
mine
who
to
use
the
words
of
goethe
had
consented
to
die
the
great
goethe
whose
own
vital
force
was
something
extraordinary
actually
believed
that
one
never
dies
until
one
really
wants
to
die
that
is
to
say
when
all
those
energies
which
resist
dissolution
and
teh
sum
of
which
make
up
life
itself
have
been
totally
destroyed
in
other
words
he
believed
that
people
only
die
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
for
them
to
live
good
it
is
merely
a
question
of
properly
understanding
one
another
and
when
fully
comprehended
the
magnificent
idea
of
goethe
only
brings
us
quietly
back
to
the
song
of
la
palisse
well
my
excellent
colleague
had
consented
to
die
thanks
to
several
successive
attacks
of
extremely
persuasive
apoplexy
the
last
of
which
proved
unanswerable
i
had
been
very
little
acquainted
with
him
during
his
lifetime
but
it
seems
that
i
became
his
friend
the
moment
he
was
dead
for
our
colleagues
assured
me
in
a
most
serious
manner
with
deeply
sympathetic
countenances
that
i
should
act
as
one
of
the
and
deliver
an
address
over
the
tomb
after
having
read
very
badly
a
short
address
i
had
written
as
well
as
i
could
which
is
not
saying
much
for
it
i
started
out
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
of
avray
and
followed
without
leaning
too
much
on
the
captain
s
cane
a
shaded
path
on
which
the
sunlight
fell
through
foliage
in
little
discs
of
gold
never
had
the
scent
of
grass
and
fresh
leaves
never
had
the
beauty
of
the
sky
over
the
trees
and
the
serene
might
of
noble
tree
contours
so
deeply
affected
my
senses
and
all
my
being
and
the
pleasure
i
felt
in
that
silence
broken
only
by
faintest
tinkling
sounds
was
at
once
of
the
senses
and
of
the
soul
i
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
roadside
under
a
clump
of
young
oaks
and
there
i
made
a
promise
to
myself
not
to
die
or
at
least
not
to
consent
to
die
before
i
should
be
again
able
to
sit
down
under
and
oak
where
in
the
great
peace
of
the
open
country
i
could
meditate
on
the
nature
of
the
soul
and
the
ultimate
destiny
of
man
a
bee
whose
brown
gleamed
in
the
sun
like
armour
of
old
gold
came
to
light
upon
a
close
by
me
darkly
rich
in
colour
and
fully
opened
upon
its
tufted
stalk
it
was
certainly
not
the
first
time
i
had
witnessed
so
common
an
incident
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
watched
it
with
such
comprehensive
and
friendly
curiosity
i
could
discern
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
sympathies
between
the
insect
and
the
flower
a
thousand
singular
little
relationships
which
i
had
never
before
even
suspected
satiated
with
nectar
the
insect
rose
and
buzzed
away
in
a
straight
line
while
i
lifted
myself
up
as
best
i
could
and
readjusted
myself
upon
my
legs
adieu
i
said
to
the
flower
and
to
the
bee
adieu
heaven
grant
i
may
live
long
enough
to
discover
the
secret
of
your
harmonies
i
am
very
tired
but
man
is
so
made
that
he
can
only
find
relaxation
from
one
kind
of
labour
by
taking
up
another
the
flowers
and
insects
will
give
me
that
relaxation
with
god
s
will
after
my
long
researches
in
philology
and
diplomatics
how
full
of
meaning
is
that
old
myth
of
antaeus
i
have
touched
the
earth
and
i
am
a
new
man
and
now
at
seventy
years
of
age
new
feelings
of
curiosity
take
birth
in
my
mind
even
as
young
shoots
sometimes
spring
up
from
the
hollow
trunk
of
an
aged
oak
june
i
like
to
look
out
of
my
window
at
the
seine
and
its
quays
on
those
soft
grey
mornings
which
give
such
an
infinite
tenderness
of
tint
to
everything
i
have
seen
that
azure
sky
which
flings
so
luminous
a
calm
over
the
bay
of
naples
but
our
parisian
sky
is
more
animated
more
kindly
more
spiritual
it
smiles
threatens
caresses
takes
an
aspect
of
melancholy
or
a
look
of
merriment
like
a
human
gaze
at
this
moment
it
is
pouring
down
a
very
gentle
light
on
the
men
and
beasts
of
the
city
as
they
accomplish
their
daily
tasks
over
there
on
the
opposite
bank
the
stevedores
of
the
port
are
unloading
a
cargo
of
cow
s
horns
while
two
men
standing
on
a
gangway
are
tossing
from
one
to
the
other
and
thence
to
somebody
in
the
hold
of
a
steamer
on
the
north
quay
the
standing
in
a
line
under
the
shade
of
the
each
with
its
head
in
a
are
quietly
munching
their
oats
while
the
rubicund
drivers
are
drinking
at
the
counter
of
the
opposite
but
all
the
while
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
early
customers
the
dealers
in
books
put
their
boxes
on
the
parapet
these
good
retailers
of
mind
who
are
always
in
the
open
air
with
blouses
loose
to
the
breeze
have
become
so
weatherbeaten
by
the
wind
the
rain
the
frost
the
snow
the
fog
and
the
great
sun
that
they
end
by
looking
very
much
like
the
old
statues
of
cathedrals
they
are
all
friends
of
mine
and
i
scarcely
ever
pass
by
their
boxes
without
picking
out
of
one
of
them
some
old
book
which
i
had
always
been
in
need
of
up
to
that
very
moment
without
any
suspicion
of
the
fact
on
my
part
then
on
my
return
home
i
have
to
endure
the
outcries
of
my
housekeeper
who
accuses
me
of
bursting
all
my
pockets
and
filling
the
house
with
waste
paper
to
attract
the
rats
therese
is
wise
about
that
and
it
is
because
she
is
wise
that
i
do
not
listen
to
her
for
in
spite
of
my
tranquil
mien
i
have
always
preferred
the
folly
of
the
passions
to
the
wisdom
of
indifference
but
just
because
my
own
passions
are
not
of
that
sort
which
burst
out
with
violence
to
devastate
and
kill
the
common
mind
is
not
aware
of
their
existence
nevertheless
i
am
greatly
moved
by
them
at
times
and
it
has
more
than
once
been
my
fate
to
lose
my
sleep
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pages
written
by
some
forgotten
monk
or
printed
by
some
humble
apprentice
of
peter
schaeffer
and
if
these
fierce
enthusiasms
are
slowly
being
quenched
in
me
it
is
only
because
i
am
being
slowly
quenched
myself
our
passions
are
ourselves
my
old
books
are
me
i
am
just
as
old
and
as
they
are
a
light
breeze
sweeps
away
along
with
the
dust
of
the
pavements
the
winged
seeds
of
the
plane
trees
and
the
fragments
of
hay
dropped
from
the
mouths
of
the
horses
the
dust
is
nothing
remarkable
in
itself
but
as
i
watch
it
flying
i
remember
a
moment
in
my
childhood
when
i
watched
just
such
a
swirl
of
dust
and
my
old
parisian
soul
is
much
affected
by
that
sudden
recollection
all
that
i
see
from
my
window
that
horizon
which
extends
to
the
left
as
far
as
the
hills
of
chaillot
and
enables
me
to
distinguish
the
arc
de
triomphe
like
a
die
of
stone
the
seine
river
of
glory
and
its
bridges
the
of
the
terrace
of
the
tuileries
the
louvre
of
the
renaissance
cut
and
graven
like
and
on
my
right
towards
the
pons
lutetiae
novus
dictus
as
it
is
named
on
old
engravings
all
the
old
and
venerable
part
of
paris
with
its
towers
and
spires
all
that
is
my
life
it
is
myself
and
i
should
be
nothing
but
for
all
those
things
which
are
thus
reflected
in
me
through
my
thousand
varying
shades
of
thought
inspiring
me
and
animating
me
that
is
why
i
love
paris
with
an
immense
love
and
nevertheless
i
am
weary
and
i
know
that
there
can
be
no
rest
for
me
in
the
heart
of
this
great
city
which
thinks
so
much
which
has
taught
me
to
think
and
which
for
ever
urges
me
to
think
more
and
how
avoid
being
exited
among
all
these
books
which
incessantly
tempt
my
curiosity
without
ever
satisfying
it
at
one
moment
it
is
a
date
i
have
to
look
for
at
another
it
is
the
name
of
a
place
i
have
to
make
sure
of
or
some
quaint
term
of
which
it
is
important
to
determine
the
exact
meaning
words
why
yes
words
as
a
philologist
i
am
their
sovereign
they
are
my
subjects
and
like
a
good
king
i
devote
my
whole
life
to
them
but
shall
i
not
be
able
to
abdicate
some
day
i
have
an
idea
that
there
is
somewhere
or
other
quite
far
from
here
a
certain
little
cottage
where
i
could
enjoy
the
quiet
i
so
much
need
while
awaiting
that
day
in
which
a
greater
quiet
that
which
can
be
never
broken
shall
come
to
wrap
me
all
about
i
dream
of
a
bench
before
the
threshold
and
of
fields
spreading
away
out
of
sight
but
i
must
have
a
fresh
smiling
young
face
beside
me
to
reflect
and
concentrate
all
that
freshness
of
nature
i
could
then
imagine
myself
a
grandfather
and
all
the
long
void
of
my
life
would
be
filled
i
am
not
a
violent
man
and
yet
i
become
easily
vexed
and
all
my
works
have
caused
me
quite
as
much
pain
as
pleasure
and
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
that
i
still
keep
thinking
about
that
very
conceited
and
very
inconsiderated
impertinence
which
my
young
friend
of
the
luxembourg
took
the
liberty
to
utter
about
me
some
three
months
ago
i
do
not
call
him
friend
in
irony
for
i
love
studious
youth
with
all
it
temerities
and
imaginative
eccentricities
still
my
young
friend
certainly
went
beyond
all
bounds
master
ambroise
pare
who
was
the
first
to
attempt
the
ligature
of
arteries
and
who
having
commenced
his
profession
at
a
time
when
surgery
was
only
performed
by
quack
barbers
nevertheless
succeeded
in
lifting
the
science
to
the
high
place
it
now
occupies
was
assailed
in
his
old
age
by
all
the
young
sawbones
apprentices
being
grossly
abused
during
a
discussion
by
some
young
addlehead
who
might
have
been
the
best
son
in
the
world
but
who
certainly
lacked
all
sense
of
respect
the
old
master
answered
him
in
his
treatise
de
la
mumie
de
la
licorne
des
venins
et
de
la
peste
i
pray
him
said
the
great
man
i
pray
him
that
if
he
desire
to
make
any
contradictions
to
my
reply
he
abandon
all
animosities
and
treat
the
good
old
man
with
this
answer
seems
admirable
from
the
pen
of
ambroise
pare
but
even
had
it
been
written
by
a
village
bonesetter
grown
grey
in
his
calling
and
mocked
by
some
young
stripling
it
would
still
be
worthy
of
all
praise
it
might
perhaps
seem
that
my
memory
of
the
incident
had
been
kept
alive
only
by
a
base
feeling
of
resentment
i
thought
so
myself
at
first
and
reproached
myself
for
thus
dwelling
on
the
saying
of
a
boy
who
could
not
yet
know
the
meaning
of
his
own
words
but
my
reflections
on
this
subject
subsequently
took
a
better
course
that
is
why
i
now
note
them
down
in
my
diary
i
remembered
that
one
day
when
i
was
twenty
years
old
that
was
more
than
half
a
century
ago
i
was
walking
about
in
that
very
same
garden
of
the
luxembourg
with
some
comrades
we
were
talking
about
our
old
professors
and
one
of
us
happened
to
name
monsieur
an
estimable
and
learned
man
who
was
the
first
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
origins
of
early
etruscan
civilisation
but
who
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
prepare
a
chronological
table
of
the
lovers
of
helen
we
all
laughed
a
great
deal
about
that
chronological
table
and
i
cried
out
is
an
ass
not
in
three
letters
but
in
twelve
whole
volumes
this
foolish
speech
of
my
adolescence
was
uttered
too
lightly
to
be
a
weight
on
my
conscience
as
an
old
man
may
god
kindly
prove
to
me
some
day
that
i
never
used
an
less
innocent
shaft
of
speech
in
the
battle
of
life
but
i
now
ask
myself
whether
i
really
never
wrote
at
any
time
in
my
life
something
quite
as
unconsciously
absurd
as
the
chronological
table
of
the
lovers
of
helen
the
progress
of
science
renders
useless
the
very
books
which
have
been
the
greatest
aids
to
that
progress
as
those
works
are
no
longer
useful
modern
youth
is
naturally
inclined
to
believe
they
never
had
any
value
it
despises
them
and
ridicules
them
if
they
happen
to
contain
any
superannuated
opinion
whatever
that
is
why
in
my
twentieth
year
i
amused
myself
at
the
expense
of
monsieur
and
his
chronological
table
and
that
was
why
the
other
day
at
the
luxembourg
my
young
and
irreverent
friend
rentre
en
octave
et
cesse
de
te
plaindre
quoi
tu
veux
qu
on
t
epargne
et
n
as
rien
epargne
look
into
thyself
octavius
and
cease
complaining
what
thou
wouldst
be
spared
and
thou
thyself
hast
spared
none
june
it
was
the
first
thursday
in
june
i
shut
up
my
books
and
took
my
leave
of
the
holy
abbot
droctoveus
who
being
now
in
the
enjoyment
of
celestial
bliss
can
not
feel
very
impatient
to
behold
his
name
and
works
glorified
on
earth
through
the
humble
compilation
being
prepared
by
my
hands
must
i
confess
it
that
i
saw
visited
by
a
bee
the
other
day
has
been
occupying
my
thoughts
much
more
than
all
the
ancient
abbots
who
ever
bore
croisers
or
wore
mitres
there
is
in
one
of
sprengel
s
books
which
i
read
in
my
youth
at
that
time
when
i
used
to
read
in
my
youth
at
that
time
when
i
used
to
read
anything
and
everything
some
ideas
about
the
loves
of
flowers
which
now
return
to
memory
after
having
been
forgotten
for
half
a
century
and
which
interest
me
so
much
that
i
regret
not
to
have
devoted
the
humble
capacities
of
my
mind
to
the
study
of
insects
and
of
plants
and
only
awhile
ago
my
housekeeper
surprised
me
at
the
kitchen
window
in
the
act
of
examining
some
wallflowers
through
a
it
was
while
looking
for
my
cravat
that
i
made
these
reflections
but
after
searching
to
no
purpose
in
a
great
number
of
drawers
i
found
myself
obliged
after
all
to
have
recourse
to
my
housekeeper
therese
came
limping
in
monsieur
she
said
you
ought
to
have
told
me
you
were
going
out
and
i
would
have
given
you
your
cravat
but
therese
i
replied
would
it
not
be
a
great
deal
better
to
put
in
some
place
where
i
could
find
it
without
your
help
therese
did
not
deign
to
answer
me
therese
no
longer
allows
me
to
arrange
anything
i
can
not
even
have
a
handkerchief
without
asking
her
for
it
and
as
she
is
deaf
crippled
and
what
is
worse
beginning
to
lose
her
memory
i
languish
in
perpetual
destitution
but
she
exercises
her
domestic
authority
with
such
quiet
pride
that
i
do
not
feel
the
courage
to
attempt
a
coup
d
etat
against
her
government
my
cravat
therese
do
you
hear
my
cravat
if
you
drive
me
wild
like
this
with
your
slow
ways
it
will
not
be
a
cravat
i
shall
need
but
a
rope
to
hang
myself
you
must
be
in
a
very
great
hurry
monsieur
replied
therese
your
cravat
is
not
lost
nothing
is
ever
lost
in
this
house
because
i
have
charge
of
everything
but
please
allow
me
the
time
at
least
to
find
yet
here
i
thought
to
myself
here
is
the
result
of
half
a
century
of
devotedness
and
ah
if
by
any
happy
chance
this
inexorable
therese
had
once
in
her
whole
life
only
once
failed
in
her
duty
as
a
servant
if
she
had
ever
been
at
fault
for
one
single
instant
she
could
never
have
assumed
this
inflexible
authority
over
me
and
i
should
at
least
have
the
courage
to
resist
her
but
how
can
one
resist
virtue
the
people
who
have
no
weaknesses
are
terrible
there
is
no
way
of
taking
advantage
of
them
just
look
at
therese
for
example
she
has
not
a
single
fault
for
which
you
can
blame
her
she
has
no
doubt
of
herself
nor
of
god
nor
of
the
world
she
is
the
valiant
woman
the
wise
virgin
of
scripture
others
may
know
nothing
about
her
but
i
know
her
worth
in
my
fancy
i
always
see
her
carrying
a
lamp
a
humble
kitchen
lamp
illuminating
the
beams
of
some
rustic
roof
a
lamp
which
will
never
go
out
while
suspended
from
that
meagre
arm
of
hers
scraggy
and
strong
as
a
therese
my
cravat
don
t
you
know
wretched
woman
that
is
the
first
thursday
in
june
and
that
mademoiselle
jeanne
will
be
waiting
for
me
the
schoolmistress
has
certainly
had
the
parlour
floor
vigorously
waxed
i
am
sure
one
can
look
at
oneself
in
it
now
and
it
will
be
quite
a
consolation
for
me
when
i
slip
and
break
my
old
bones
upon
it
which
is
sure
to
happen
sooner
or
later
to
see
my
rueful
countenance
reflected
in
it
as
in
a
then
taking
for
my
model
that
amiable
and
admirable
hero
whose
image
is
carved
upon
the
handle
of
uncle
victor
s
i
will
control
myself
so
as
not
to
make
too
ugly
a
grimace
see
what
a
splendid
sun
the
quays
are
all
gilded
by
it
and
the
seine
smiles
in
countless
little
flashing
wrinkles
the
city
is
gold
a
blonde
and
as
a
woman
s
hair
floats
above
its
beautiful
contours
therese
my
cravat
ah
i
can
now
comprehend
the
wisdom
of
that
old
chrysal
who
used
to
keep
his
neckbands
in
a
big
plutarch
hereafter
i
shall
follow
his
example
by
laying
all
my
neckties
away
between
the
leaves
of
the
acta
therese
let
me
talk
on
and
keeps
looking
for
the
necktie
in
silence
i
hear
a
gentle
ringing
at
our
therese
i
exclaim
there
is
somebody
ringing
the
bell
give
me
my
cravat
and
go
to
the
door
or
rather
go
to
the
door
first
and
then
with
the
help
of
heaven
you
will
give
me
my
cravat
but
please
do
not
stand
there
between
the
and
the
door
like
an
old
between
two
therese
marched
to
the
door
as
if
advancing
upon
the
enemy
my
excellent
housekeeper
becomes
more
inhospitable
the
older
she
grows
every
stranger
is
an
object
of
suspicion
to
her
according
to
her
own
assertion
this
disposition
is
the
result
of
a
long
experience
with
human
nature
i
had
not
the
time
to
consider
whether
the
same
experience
on
the
part
of
another
experimenter
would
produce
the
same
results
maitre
mouche
was
waiting
to
see
me
in
the
maitre
mouche
is
still
more
yellow
than
i
had
believed
him
to
be
he
wears
blue
glasses
and
his
eyes
keep
moving
uneasily
behind
them
like
mice
running
about
behind
a
screen
maitre
mouche
excuses
himself
for
having
intruded
upon
me
at
a
moment
when
he
does
not
characterise
the
moment
but
i
think
he
means
to
say
a
moment
in
which
i
happen
to
be
without
my
cravat
it
is
not
my
fault
as
you
very
well
know
maitre
mouche
who
does
not
know
does
not
appear
to
be
at
all
shocked
however
he
is
only
afraid
that
he
might
have
dropped
in
at
the
wrong
moment
i
succeeded
in
partially
reassuring
him
at
once
upon
that
point
he
then
tells
me
it
is
as
guardian
of
mademoiselle
alexandre
that
he
has
come
to
talk
with
me
first
of
all
he
desires
that
i
shall
not
hereafter
pay
any
heed
to
those
restrictions
he
had
at
first
deemed
necessary
to
put
upon
the
permit
given
to
visit
mademoiselle
jeanne
at
the
henceforth
the
establishment
of
mademoiselle
prefere
will
be
open
to
me
any
day
that
i
might
choose
to
call
between
the
hours
of
midday
and
four
o
clock
knowing
the
interest
i
have
taken
in
the
young
girl
he
considers
it
his
duty
to
give
me
some
information
about
the
person
to
whom
he
has
confided
his
ward
mademoiselle
prefere
whom
he
has
known
for
many
years
is
in
possession
of
his
utmost
confidence
mademoiselle
prefere
is
in
his
estimation
an
enlightened
person
of
excellent
morals
and
capable
of
giving
excellent
counsel
mademoiselle
prefer
he
said
to
me
has
principles
and
principles
are
rare
these
days
monsieur
everything
has
been
totally
changed
and
this
epoch
of
ours
can
not
compare
with
the
preceding
my
stairway
is
a
good
example
monsieur
i
replied
years
ago
it
used
to
allow
me
to
climb
it
without
any
trouble
and
now
it
takes
my
breath
away
and
wears
my
legs
out
before
i
have
climbed
half
a
dozen
steps
it
has
had
its
character
spoiled
then
there
are
those
journals
and
books
i
used
once
to
devour
without
difficulty
by
moonlight
even
in
the
brightest
sunlight
they
mock
my
curiosity
and
exhibit
nothing
but
a
blur
of
white
and
black
when
i
have
not
got
my
spectacles
on
then
the
gout
has
got
into
my
limbs
that
is
another
malicious
trick
of
the
times
not
only
that
monsieur
gravely
replied
maitre
mouche
but
what
is
really
unfortunate
in
our
epoch
is
that
no
one
is
satisfied
with
his
position
from
the
top
of
society
to
the
bottom
in
every
class
there
prevails
a
discontent
a
restlessness
a
love
of
comfort
mon
dieu
monsieur
i
exclaimed
you
think
this
love
of
comfort
is
a
sign
of
the
times
men
have
never
had
at
any
epoch
a
love
of
discomfort
they
have
always
tried
to
better
their
condition
this
constant
effort
produces
constant
changes
and
the
effort
is
always
going
on
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
ah
monsieur
replied
maitre
mouche
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
live
in
your
books
out
of
the
business
world
altogether
you
do
not
see
as
i
see
them
the
conflicts
of
interest
the
struggle
for
money
it
is
the
same
effervescence
in
all
minds
great
or
small
the
wildest
speculations
are
being
everywhere
indulged
in
what
i
see
around
me
simply
terrifies
me
i
wondered
within
myself
whether
maitre
mouche
had
called
upon
me
only
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
his
virtuous
misanthropy
but
all
at
once
i
heard
words
of
a
more
consoling
character
issue
from
his
lips
maitre
mouche
began
to
speak
to
me
of
virginie
prefere
as
a
person
worthy
of
respect
of
esteem
and
of
sympathy
highly
honourable
capable
of
great
devotedness
cultivated
discreet
able
to
read
aloud
remarkably
well
extremely
modest
and
skillful
in
the
art
of
applying
blisters
then
i
began
to
understand
that
he
had
only
been
painting
that
dismal
picture
of
universal
corruption
in
order
the
better
to
bring
out
by
contrast
the
virtues
of
the
schoolmistress
i
was
further
informed
that
the
institution
in
the
rue
demours
was
well
patronised
prosperous
and
enjoyed
a
high
reputation
with
the
public
maitre
mouche
lifted
up
his
hand
with
a
black
woollen
glove
on
it
as
if
making
oath
to
the
truth
of
these
statements
then
he
added
i
am
enabled
by
the
very
character
of
my
profession
to
know
a
great
deal
about
people
a
notary
is
to
a
certain
extent
a
i
deemed
it
my
duty
monsieur
to
give
you
this
agreeable
information
at
the
moment
when
a
lucky
chance
enabled
you
to
meet
mademoiselle
prefere
there
is
only
one
thing
more
which
i
would
like
to
say
this
lady
who
is
of
course
quite
unaware
of
my
action
in
the
matter
spoke
to
me
of
you
the
other
day
in
terms
of
deepest
sympathy
i
could
only
weaken
their
expression
by
repeating
them
to
you
and
furthermore
i
could
not
repeat
them
without
betraying
to
a
certain
extent
the
confidence
of
mademoiselle
do
not
betray
it
monsieur
do
not
betray
it
i
responded
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
no
idea
that
mademoiselle
prefere
knew
anything
whatever
about
me
but
since
you
have
the
influence
of
an
old
friend
with
her
i
will
take
advantage
of
your
good
will
monsieur
to
ask
you
to
exercise
that
influence
in
behalf
of
mademoiselle
jeanne
alexandre
the
child
for
she
is
still
a
child
is
overloaded
with
work
she
is
at
once
a
pupil
and
a
mistress
she
is
overtasked
besides
she
is
punished
in
petty
disgusting
ways
and
hers
is
one
of
those
generous
natures
which
will
be
forced
into
revolt
by
such
continual
alas
replied
maitre
mouche
she
must
be
trained
to
take
her
part
in
the
struggle
of
life
one
does
not
come
into
this
world
simply
to
amuse
oneself
and
to
do
just
what
one
one
comes
into
this
world
i
responded
rather
warmly
to
enjoy
what
is
beautiful
and
what
is
good
and
to
do
as
one
pleases
when
the
things
one
wants
to
do
are
noble
intelligent
and
generous
an
education
which
does
not
cultivate
the
will
is
an
education
that
depraves
the
mind
it
is
a
teacher
s
duty
to
teach
the
pupil
how
to
i
perceived
that
maitre
mouche
began
to
think
me
a
rather
silly
man
with
a
great
deal
of
quiet
he
proceeded
you
must
remember
monsieur
that
the
education
of
the
poor
has
to
be
conducted
with
a
great
deal
of
circumspection
and
with
a
view
to
that
future
state
of
dependence
they
must
occupy
in
society
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
the
late
noel
alexandre
died
a
bankrupt
and
that
his
daughter
is
being
educated
almost
by
charity
oh
monsieur
i
exclaimed
do
not
say
it
to
say
it
is
to
pay
oneself
back
and
then
the
statement
ceases
to
be
the
liabilities
of
the
estate
continued
the
notary
exceeded
the
assets
but
i
was
able
to
effect
a
settlement
with
the
creditors
in
favour
of
the
he
undertook
to
explain
matters
in
detail
i
declined
to
listen
to
these
explanations
being
incapable
of
understanding
business
methods
in
general
and
those
of
maitre
mouche
in
particular
the
notary
then
took
it
upon
himself
to
justify
mademoiselle
prefere
s
educational
system
and
observed
by
way
of
conclusion
it
is
not
by
amusing
oneself
that
one
can
it
is
only
by
amusing
oneself
that
one
can
learn
i
replied
the
whole
art
of
teaching
is
only
the
art
of
awakening
the
natural
curiosity
of
young
minds
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
it
afterwards
and
curiosity
itself
can
be
vivid
and
wholesome
only
in
proportion
as
the
mind
is
contented
and
happy
those
acquirements
crammed
by
force
into
the
minds
of
children
simply
clog
and
stifle
intelligence
in
order
that
knowledge
be
properly
digested
it
must
have
been
swallowed
with
a
good
appetite
i
know
jeanne
if
that
child
were
intrusted
to
my
care
i
should
make
of
her
not
a
learned
woman
for
i
would
look
to
her
future
happiness
only
but
a
child
full
of
bright
intelligence
and
full
of
life
in
whom
everything
beautiful
in
art
or
nature
would
awaken
some
gentle
responsive
thrill
i
would
teach
her
to
live
in
sympathy
with
all
that
is
beautiful
comely
landscapes
the
ideal
scenes
of
poetry
and
history
the
emotional
charm
of
noble
music
i
would
make
lovable
to
her
everything
i
would
wish
her
to
love
even
her
needlework
i
would
make
pleasurable
to
her
by
a
proper
choice
of
fabrics
the
style
of
embroideries
the
designs
of
lace
i
would
give
her
a
beautiful
dog
and
a
pony
to
teach
her
how
to
manage
animals
i
would
give
her
birds
to
take
care
of
so
that
she
could
learn
the
value
of
even
a
drop
of
water
and
a
crumb
of
bread
and
in
order
that
she
should
have
a
still
higher
pleasure
i
would
train
her
to
find
delight
in
exercising
charity
and
inasmuch
as
none
of
us
may
escape
pain
i
should
teach
her
that
christian
wisdom
which
elevates
us
above
all
suffering
and
gives
a
beauty
even
to
grief
itself
that
is
my
idea
of
the
right
way
to
educate
a
young
i
yield
monsieur
replied
maitre
mouche
joining
his
hands
together
and
he
rose
of
course
you
understand
i
remarked
as
i
went
to
the
door
with
him
that
i
do
not
pretend
for
a
moment
to
impose
my
educational
system
upon
mademoiselle
prefere
it
is
necessarily
a
private
one
and
quite
incompatible
with
the
organisation
of
even
the
boarding
schools
i
only
ask
you
to
persuade
her
to
give
jeanne
less
work
and
more
play
and
not
to
punish
her
except
in
case
of
absolute
necessity
and
to
let
her
have
as
much
freedom
of
mind
and
body
as
the
regulations
of
the
institution
it
was
with
a
pale
and
mysterious
smile
that
maitre
mouche
informed
me
that
my
observations
would
be
taken
in
good
part
and
should
receive
all
possible
consideration
therewith
he
made
me
a
little
bow
and
took
his
departure
leaving
me
with
a
peculiar
feeling
of
discomfort
and
uneasiness
i
have
met
a
great
many
strange
characters
in
my
time
but
never
any
at
all
resembling
either
this
notary
or
this
schoolmistress
july
maitre
mouche
has
so
much
delayed
me
by
his
visit
that
i
gave
up
going
to
see
jeanne
that
day
professional
duties
kept
me
very
busy
for
the
rest
of
the
week
although
at
the
age
when
most
men
retire
altogether
from
active
life
i
am
still
attached
by
a
thousand
ties
to
the
society
in
which
i
have
lived
i
have
to
reside
at
meetings
of
academies
scientific
congresses
assemblies
of
various
learned
bodies
i
am
overburdened
with
honorary
functions
i
have
seven
of
these
in
one
governmental
department
alone
the
bureaux
would
be
very
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
but
habit
is
stronger
than
both
of
us
together
and
i
continue
to
hobble
up
the
stairs
of
various
government
buildings
old
clerks
point
me
out
to
each
other
as
i
go
by
like
a
ghost
wandering
through
the
corridors
when
one
has
become
very
old
one
finds
it
extremely
difficult
to
disappear
nevertheless
it
is
time
as
the
old
song
says
de
prendre
ma
retraite
et
de
songer
a
faire
un
fin
to
retire
on
my
pension
and
prepare
myself
to
die
a
good
death
an
old
marchioness
who
used
to
be
a
friend
of
hevetius
in
her
youth
and
whom
i
once
met
at
my
father
s
house
when
a
very
old
woman
was
visited
during
her
last
sickness
by
the
priest
of
her
parish
who
wanted
to
prepare
her
to
die
is
that
really
necessary
she
asked
i
see
everybody
else
manage
it
perfectly
well
the
first
my
father
went
to
see
her
very
soon
afterwards
and
found
her
extremely
my
friend
she
said
pressing
his
hand
i
am
going
to
see
whether
god
improves
upon
so
were
wont
to
die
the
belles
amies
of
the
philosophers
such
an
end
is
certainly
not
vulgar
nor
impertinent
and
such
levities
are
not
of
the
sort
that
emanate
from
dull
minds
nevertheless
they
shock
me
neither
my
fears
nor
my
hopes
could
accommodate
themselves
to
such
a
mode
of
departure
i
would
like
to
make
mine
with
a
perfectly
collected
mind
and
that
is
why
i
must
begin
to
think
in
a
year
or
two
about
some
way
of
belonging
to
myself
otherwise
i
should
certainly
risk
but
hush
let
him
not
hear
his
name
and
turn
to
look
as
he
passes
by
i
can
still
lift
my
fagot
without
his
aid
i
found
jeanne
very
happy
indeed
she
told
me
that
on
the
thursday
previous
after
the
visit
of
her
guardian
mademoiselle
prefere
had
set
her
free
from
the
ordinary
regulations
and
lightened
her
tasks
in
several
ways
since
that
lucky
thursday
she
could
walk
in
the
garden
which
only
lacked
leaves
and
flowers
as
much
as
she
liked
and
she
had
been
given
facilities
to
work
at
her
unfortunate
little
figure
of
she
said
to
me
with
a
smile
i
know
very
well
that
i
owe
all
of
this
to
i
tried
to
talk
with
her
about
other
matters
but
i
remarked
that
she
could
not
attend
to
what
i
was
saying
in
spite
of
her
effort
to
do
so
i
see
you
are
thinking
about
something
else
i
said
well
tell
me
what
it
is
for
if
you
do
not
we
shall
not
be
able
to
talk
to
each
other
at
all
which
would
be
very
unworthy
of
both
of
she
answered
oh
i
was
really
listening
to
you
monsieur
but
it
is
true
that
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
you
will
excuse
me
won
t
you
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
mademoiselle
prefere
must
like
you
very
very
much
indeed
to
have
become
so
good
to
me
all
of
a
then
she
looked
at
me
in
an
odd
smiling
frightened
way
which
made
me
laugh
does
that
surprise
you
i
asked
very
much
she
replied
please
tell
me
why
because
i
can
see
no
reason
no
reason
at
all
but
there
no
reason
at
all
why
you
should
please
mademoiselle
prefere
so
so
then
you
think
i
am
very
displeasing
jeanne
she
bit
her
lips
as
if
to
punish
them
for
having
made
a
mistake
and
then
in
a
coaxing
way
looking
at
me
with
great
soft
eyes
gentle
and
beautiful
as
a
spaniel
s
she
said
i
know
i
said
a
foolish
think
but
still
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
you
should
be
so
pleasing
to
mademoiselle
prefere
and
nevertheless
you
seem
to
please
her
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
she
called
me
one
day
and
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
really
yes
she
wanted
to
find
out
all
about
your
house
just
think
she
even
asked
me
how
old
your
servant
was
and
jeanne
burst
out
laughing
well
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
asked
she
remained
a
long
while
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
cloth
of
her
shoes
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
very
deeply
finally
looking
up
again
she
answered
i
am
distrustful
isn
t
it
very
natural
to
feel
uneasy
about
what
one
can
not
understand
i
know
i
am
foolish
but
you
won
t
be
offended
with
me
will
you
why
certainly
not
jeanne
i
am
not
a
bit
offended
with
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
was
beginning
to
share
her
surprise
and
i
began
to
turn
over
in
my
old
head
the
singular
thought
of
this
young
girl
one
is
uneasy
about
what
one
can
not
but
with
a
fresh
burst
of
merriment
she
cried
out
she
asked
me
guess
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
guesses
a
thousand
guesses
you
give
it
up
she
asked
me
if
you
liked
good
and
how
did
you
receive
this
shower
of
interrogations
jeanne
i
replied
i
don
t
know
and
mademoiselle
then
said
to
me
you
are
a
little
fool
the
least
details
of
the
life
of
an
eminent
man
ought
to
be
observed
please
to
know
mademoiselle
that
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
is
one
of
the
glories
of
france
stuff
i
exclaimed
and
what
did
you
think
about
it
mademoiselle
i
thought
that
mademoiselle
prefere
was
right
but
i
don
t
care
at
all
i
know
it
is
naughty
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
don
t
care
a
bit
not
a
bit
whether
mademoiselle
prefere
is
or
is
not
right
about
well
then
content
yourself
jeanne
mademoiselle
prefere
was
not
yes
yes
she
was
quite
right
that
time
but
i
wanted
to
love
everybody
who
loved
you
everybody
without
exception
and
i
can
not
do
it
because
it
would
never
be
possible
for
me
to
love
mademoiselle
listen
jeanne
i
answered
very
seriously
mademoiselle
prefere
has
become
good
to
you
try
now
to
be
good
to
she
answered
sharply
it
is
very
easy
for
mademoiselle
prefere
to
be
good
to
me
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
for
me
to
be
good
to
i
then
said
in
a
still
more
serious
tone
my
child
the
authority
of
a
teacher
is
sacred
you
must
consider
your
schoolmistress
as
occupying
the
place
to
you
of
the
mother
whom
you
i
had
scarcely
uttered
this
solemn
stupidity
when
i
bitterly
regretted
it
the
child
turned
pale
and
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
oh
monsieur
she
cried
how
could
you
say
such
a
thing
you
you
never
knew
mamma
ay
just
heaven
i
did
know
her
mamma
and
how
indeed
could
i
have
been
foolish
enough
to
have
said
what
i
did
she
repeated
as
if
to
herself
mamma
my
dear
mamma
my
poor
mamma
a
lucky
chance
prevented
me
from
playing
the
fool
any
further
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
at
that
moment
i
looked
as
if
i
was
going
to
cry
at
my
age
one
does
not
cry
it
must
have
been
a
bad
cough
which
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
but
anyhow
appearances
were
in
my
favour
jeanne
was
deceived
by
them
oh
what
a
pure
and
radiant
smile
suddenly
shone
out
under
her
beautiful
wet
eyelashes
like
sunshine
among
branches
after
a
summer
shower
we
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
sat
a
long
while
without
saying
a
word
absolutely
happy
those
celestial
harmonies
which
i
once
thought
i
heard
thrilling
through
my
soul
while
i
knelt
before
that
tomb
to
which
a
saintly
woman
had
guided
me
suddenly
awoke
again
in
my
heart
through
the
blissful
moments
with
infinite
softness
doubtless
the
child
whose
hand
pressed
my
own
also
heard
them
and
then
elevated
by
their
enchantment
above
the
material
world
the
poor
old
man
and
the
artless
young
girl
both
knew
that
a
tender
ghostly
presence
was
making
sweetness
all
about
them
my
child
i
said
at
last
i
am
very
old
and
many
secrets
of
life
which
you
will
only
learn
little
by
little
have
been
revealed
to
me
believe
me
the
future
is
shaped
out
of
the
past
whatever
you
can
do
to
live
contentedly
here
without
impatience
and
without
fretting
will
help
you
live
some
future
day
in
peace
and
joy
in
your
own
home
be
gentle
and
learn
how
to
suffer
when
one
suffers
patiently
one
suffers
less
if
you
should
be
badly
treated
madame
de
gabry
and
i
would
both
consider
ourselves
badly
treated
in
your
is
your
health
very
good
indeed
dear
monsieur
it
was
mademoiselle
prefere
approaching
stealthily
behind
us
who
had
asked
the
question
with
a
peculiar
smile
my
first
idea
was
to
tell
her
to
go
to
the
devil
my
second
that
her
mouth
was
as
little
suited
for
smiling
as
a
for
musical
purposes
my
third
was
to
answer
her
politely
and
assure
her
that
i
hoped
she
was
very
well
she
sent
the
young
girl
out
to
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
then
pressing
one
hand
upon
her
pelerine
and
extending
the
other
towards
the
tableau
d
honneur
she
showed
me
the
name
of
jeanne
alexandre
written
at
the
head
of
the
list
in
large
text
i
am
very
much
pleased
i
said
to
her
to
find
that
you
are
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
that
child
nothing
could
delight
me
more
and
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
this
happy
result
to
your
affectionate
vigilance
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
send
you
a
few
books
which
i
think
may
serve
both
to
instruct
and
to
amuse
young
girls
you
will
be
able
to
judge
by
glancing
over
them
whether
they
are
adapted
to
the
perusal
of
mademoiselle
alexandre
and
her
the
gratitude
of
the
schoolmistress
not
only
overflowed
in
words
but
seemed
about
to
take
the
form
of
tearful
sensibility
in
order
to
change
the
subject
i
observed
what
a
beautiful
day
this
is
yes
she
replied
and
if
this
weather
continues
those
dear
children
will
have
a
nice
time
for
their
i
suppose
you
are
referring
to
the
holidays
but
mademoiselle
alexandre
who
has
no
relatives
can
not
go
away
what
in
the
world
is
she
going
to
do
all
alone
in
this
great
big
house
oh
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
amuse
her
i
will
take
her
to
the
museums
and
she
hesitated
blushed
and
continued
and
to
your
house
if
you
will
permit
why
of
course
i
exclaimed
that
is
a
we
separated
very
good
friends
with
one
another
i
with
her
because
i
had
been
able
to
obtain
what
i
desired
she
with
me
for
no
appreciable
motive
which
fact
according
to
plato
elevated
her
into
the
highest
rank
of
the
hierarchy
of
souls
and
nevertheless
it
is
not
without
a
presentiment
of
evil
that
i
find
myself
on
the
point
of
introducing
this
person
into
my
house
and
i
would
be
very
glad
indeed
to
see
jeanne
in
charge
of
anybody
else
rather
than
of
her
maitre
mouche
and
mademoiselle
prefere
are
characters
whom
i
can
not
at
all
understand
i
never
can
imagine
why
they
say
what
they
do
say
nor
why
they
do
what
they
do
they
have
a
mysterious
something
in
common
which
makes
me
feel
uneasy
as
jeanne
said
to
me
a
little
while
ago
one
is
uneasy
about
what
one
can
not
alas
at
my
age
one
has
learned
only
too
well
how
little
sincerity
there
is
in
life
one
has
learned
only
too
well
how
much
one
loses
by
living
a
long
time
in
this
world
and
one
feels
that
one
can
no
longer
trust
any
except
the
young
august
i
waited
for
them
in
fact
i
waited
for
them
very
impatiently
i
exerted
all
my
powers
of
insinuation
and
of
coaxing
to
induce
therese
to
receive
them
kindly
but
my
powers
in
this
direction
are
very
limited
they
came
jeanne
was
neater
and
prettier
than
i
had
ever
expected
to
see
her
she
has
not
it
is
true
anything
approaching
the
charm
of
her
mother
but
for
the
first
time
i
observed
that
she
has
a
pleasing
face
and
a
pleasing
face
is
of
great
advantage
to
a
woman
in
this
world
i
think
that
her
hat
was
a
little
on
one
side
but
she
smiled
and
the
city
of
books
was
all
illuminated
by
that
smile
i
watched
therese
to
see
whether
the
rigid
manners
of
the
old
housekeeper
would
soften
a
little
at
the
sight
of
the
young
girl
i
saw
her
turning
her
lustreless
eyes
upon
jeanne
i
saw
her
long
wrinkled
face
her
toothless
mouth
and
that
pointed
chin
of
hers
like
the
chin
of
some
puissant
old
fairy
and
that
was
all
i
could
see
mademoiselle
prefere
made
her
appearance
all
in
blue
advanced
retreated
skipped
tripped
cried
out
sighed
cast
her
eyes
down
rolled
her
eyes
up
bewildered
herself
with
excuses
said
she
dared
not
and
nevertheless
dared
said
she
would
never
dare
again
and
nevertheless
dared
again
made
courtesies
innumerable
made
in
short
all
the
fuss
she
could
what
a
lot
of
books
she
screamed
and
have
you
really
read
them
all
monsieur
bonnard
alas
i
have
i
replied
and
that
is
just
the
reason
that
i
do
not
know
anything
for
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
those
books
which
does
not
contradict
some
other
book
so
that
by
the
time
one
has
read
them
all
one
does
not
know
what
to
think
about
anything
that
is
just
my
condition
thereupon
she
called
jeanne
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
her
impressions
but
jeanne
was
looking
out
of
the
window
how
beautiful
it
is
she
said
to
us
how
i
love
to
see
the
river
flowing
it
makes
you
think
about
all
kinds
of
mademoiselle
prefere
having
removed
her
hat
and
exhibited
a
forehead
tricked
out
with
blonde
curls
my
housekeeper
sturdily
snatched
up
the
hat
at
once
with
the
observation
that
she
did
not
like
to
see
people
s
clothes
scattered
over
the
furniture
then
she
approached
jeanne
and
asked
her
for
her
things
calling
her
my
little
lady
the
little
lady
giving
up
her
cloak
and
hat
exposed
to
view
a
very
graceful
neck
and
a
lithe
figure
whose
outlines
were
beautifully
relieved
against
the
great
glow
of
the
open
window
and
i
could
have
wished
that
some
one
else
might
have
seen
her
at
that
moment
some
one
very
different
from
an
aged
housekeeper
a
schoolmistress
frizzled
like
a
sheep
and
this
old
humbug
of
an
archivist
and
paleographer
so
you
are
looking
at
the
seine
i
said
to
her
see
how
it
sparkles
in
the
sun
yes
she
replied
leaning
over
the
windowbar
it
looks
like
a
flowing
of
fire
but
see
how
nice
and
cool
it
looks
on
the
other
side
over
there
under
the
shadow
of
the
willows
that
little
spot
there
pleases
me
better
than
all
the
good
i
answered
i
see
that
the
river
has
a
charm
for
you
how
would
you
like
with
mademoiselle
prefere
s
permission
to
make
a
trip
to
we
should
certainly
be
in
time
to
catch
the
steamboat
just
below
the
jeanne
was
delighted
with
my
suggestion
and
mademoiselle
prefere
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
but
my
housekeeper
was
not
at
all
willing
to
let
us
go
off
so
unconcernedly
she
summoned
me
into
the
whither
i
followed
her
in
fear
and
trembling
monsieur
she
said
to
me
as
soon
as
we
found
ourselves
alone
you
never
think
about
anything
and
it
is
always
i
who
have
to
think
about
everything
luckily
for
you
i
have
a
good
i
did
not
think
that
it
was
a
favourable
moment
for
any
attempt
to
dispel
this
wild
illusion
she
continued
so
you
were
going
off
without
saying
a
word
to
me
about
what
this
little
lady
likes
to
eat
at
her
age
one
does
not
know
anything
one
does
not
care
about
anything
in
particular
one
eats
like
a
bird
you
yourself
monsieur
are
very
difficult
to
please
but
at
least
you
know
what
is
good
it
is
very
different
with
these
young
people
they
do
not
know
anything
about
cooking
it
is
often
the
very
best
thing
which
they
think
the
worst
and
what
is
bad
seems
to
them
good
because
their
stomachs
are
not
quite
formed
yet
so
that
one
never
knows
just
what
to
do
for
them
tell
me
if
the
little
lady
would
like
a
pigeon
cooked
with
green
peas
and
whether
she
is
fond
of
vanilla
my
good
therese
i
answered
just
do
whatever
you
think
best
and
whatever
that
may
be
i
am
sure
it
will
be
very
nice
those
ladies
will
be
quite
contented
with
our
humble
ordinary
therese
replied
very
dryly
monsieur
i
am
asking
you
about
the
little
lady
she
must
not
leave
this
house
without
having
enjoyed
herself
a
little
as
for
that
old
thing
if
she
doesn
t
like
my
dinner
she
can
suck
her
thumbs
i
don
t
care
what
she
likes
my
mind
being
thus
set
at
rest
i
returned
to
the
city
of
books
where
mademoiselle
prefere
was
crocheting
as
calmly
as
if
she
were
at
home
i
almost
felt
inclined
myself
to
think
she
was
she
did
not
take
up
much
room
it
is
true
in
the
angle
of
the
window
but
she
had
chosen
her
chair
and
her
footstool
so
well
that
those
articles
of
furniture
seemed
to
have
been
made
expressly
for
her
jeanne
on
the
other
hand
devoted
her
attention
to
the
books
and
pictures
gazing
at
them
in
a
kindly
expressive
way
as
if
she
were
bidding
them
an
affectionate
farewell
here
i
said
to
her
amuse
yourself
with
this
book
which
i
am
sure
you
can
not
help
liking
because
it
is
full
of
beautiful
and
i
threw
open
before
her
vecellio
s
collection
of
not
the
commonplace
edition
by
your
leave
so
meagrely
reproduced
by
modern
artists
but
in
truth
a
magnificent
and
venerable
copy
of
that
editio
princeps
which
is
noble
as
those
noble
dames
who
figure
upon
its
yellowed
leaves
made
beautiful
by
time
while
turning
over
the
engravings
with
artless
curiosity
jeanne
said
to
me
we
were
talking
about
taking
a
walk
but
this
is
a
great
journey
you
are
making
me
take
and
i
would
like
to
travel
very
very
far
away
in
that
case
mademoiselle
i
said
to
her
you
must
arrange
yourself
as
comfortably
as
possible
for
travelling
but
you
are
now
sitting
on
one
corner
of
your
chair
so
that
the
chair
is
standing
upon
only
one
leg
and
that
vecellio
must
tire
your
knees
sit
down
comfortably
put
your
chair
on
its
four
feet
and
put
your
book
on
the
she
obeyed
me
with
a
laugh
i
watched
her
she
cried
out
suddenly
oh
come
look
at
this
beautiful
costume
it
was
that
of
the
wife
of
a
doge
of
venice
how
noble
it
is
what
magnificent
ideas
it
gives
one
of
that
life
oh
i
must
tell
you
i
adore
luxury
you
must
not
express
such
thoughts
as
those
mademoiselle
said
the
schoolmistress
lifting
up
her
little
shapeless
nose
from
her
work
nevertheless
it
was
a
very
innocent
utterance
i
replied
there
are
splendid
souls
in
whom
the
love
of
splendid
things
is
natural
and
the
little
shapeless
nose
went
down
again
mademoiselle
prefere
likes
luxury
too
said
jeanne
she
cuts
out
paper
trimmings
and
shades
for
the
lamps
it
is
economical
luxury
but
it
is
luxury
all
the
having
returned
to
the
subject
of
venice
we
were
just
about
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
certain
patrician
lady
attired
in
an
embroidered
dalmatic
when
i
heard
the
bell
ring
i
thought
it
was
some
peddler
with
his
basket
but
the
gate
of
the
city
of
books
opened
and
well
master
sylvestre
bonnard
you
were
wishing
awhile
ago
that
the
grace
of
your
protegee
might
be
observed
by
some
other
eyes
than
old
withered
ones
behind
spectacles
your
wishes
have
been
fulfilled
in
a
most
unexpected
manner
and
a
voice
cries
out
to
you
as
to
the
imprudent
theseus
craignez
seigneur
craignez
que
le
ciel
rigoureux
ne
vous
haisse
assez
pour
exaucer
vos
voeux
souvent
dans
sa
colere
il
recoit
nos
victimes
ses
presents
sont
souvent
la
peine
de
nos
beware
my
lord
beware
lest
stern
heaven
hate
you
enough
to
hear
your
prayers
often
tis
in
wrath
that
heaven
receives
our
sacrifices
its
gifts
are
often
the
punishment
of
our
the
gate
of
the
city
of
books
had
opened
and
a
handsome
young
man
made
his
appearance
ushered
in
by
therese
that
good
old
soul
only
knows
how
to
open
the
door
for
people
and
to
shut
it
behind
them
she
has
no
idea
whatever
of
the
tact
requisite
for
the
and
for
the
parlour
it
is
not
in
her
nature
either
to
make
any
announcements
or
to
make
anybody
wait
she
either
throws
people
out
on
the
lobby
or
simply
pitches
them
at
your
head
and
here
is
this
handsome
young
man
already
inside
and
i
can
not
really
take
the
girl
at
once
and
hide
her
like
a
secret
treasure
in
the
next
room
i
wait
for
him
to
explain
himself
he
does
it
without
the
least
embarrassment
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
already
observed
the
young
girl
who
is
still
bending
over
the
table
looking
at
vecellio
as
i
observe
the
young
man
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
have
seen
him
somewhere
before
or
else
i
must
be
very
much
mistaken
his
name
is
gelis
that
is
a
name
which
i
have
heard
somewhere
i
can
t
remember
where
at
all
events
monsieur
gelis
since
there
is
a
gelis
is
a
young
fellow
he
tells
me
that
this
is
his
third
at
the
ecole
des
chartes
and
that
he
has
been
working
for
the
past
fifteen
or
eighteen
months
upon
his
graduation
thesis
the
subject
of
which
is
the
condition
of
the
benedictine
abbeys
in
he
has
just
read
my
works
upon
the
monasticon
and
he
is
convinced
that
he
can
not
terminate
this
thesis
successfully
without
my
advice
to
begin
with
and
in
the
second
place
without
a
certain
manuscript
which
i
possess
and
which
is
nothing
less
than
the
register
of
the
accounts
of
the
abbey
of
citeaux
from
to
having
thus
explained
himself
he
hands
me
a
letter
of
introduction
bearing
the
signature
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
my
colleagues
good
now
i
know
who
he
is
monsieur
gelis
is
the
very
same
young
man
who
last
year
under
the
called
me
an
idiot
and
while
unfolding
his
letter
of
introduction
i
think
to
myself
aha
my
unlucky
youth
you
are
very
far
from
suspecting
that
i
overheard
what
you
said
and
that
i
know
what
you
think
of
me
or
at
least
what
you
did
think
of
me
that
day
for
these
young
minds
are
so
fickle
i
have
got
you
now
my
friend
you
have
fallen
into
the
lion
s
den
and
so
unexpectedly
in
good
sooth
that
the
astonished
old
lion
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
prey
but
come
now
old
lion
do
not
act
like
an
idiot
is
it
not
possible
that
you
were
an
idiot
if
you
are
not
one
now
you
certainly
were
one
you
were
a
fool
to
have
been
listening
to
monsieur
gelis
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
of
marguerite
de
valois
you
were
doubly
a
fool
to
have
heard
what
he
said
and
you
were
trebly
a
fool
not
to
have
forgotten
what
it
would
have
been
much
better
never
to
have
having
thus
scolded
the
old
lion
i
exhorted
him
to
show
clemency
he
did
not
appear
to
require
much
coaxing
and
gradually
became
so
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
himself
from
bursting
out
into
joyous
roarings
from
the
way
in
which
i
had
read
my
colleague
s
letter
one
might
have
supposed
me
a
man
who
did
not
know
his
alphabet
i
took
a
long
while
to
read
it
and
monsieur
gelis
might
have
become
very
tired
under
different
circumstances
but
he
was
watching
jeanne
and
endured
the
trial
with
exemplary
patience
jeanne
occasionally
turned
her
face
in
our
direction
well
you
could
not
expect
a
person
to
remain
perfectly
motionless
could
you
mademoiselle
prefere
was
arranging
her
curls
and
her
bosom
occasionally
swelled
with
little
sighs
it
may
be
observed
that
i
have
myself
often
been
honoured
with
those
little
sighs
monsieur
i
said
as
i
folded
up
the
letter
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
be
of
any
service
to
you
you
are
occupied
with
researches
in
which
i
myself
have
always
felt
a
very
lively
interest
i
have
done
all
that
lay
in
my
power
i
know
as
you
do
and
still
better
than
you
can
know
how
much
there
remains
to
do
the
manuscript
you
asked
for
is
at
your
disposal
you
may
take
it
home
with
you
but
it
is
not
a
manuscript
of
the
smallest
kind
and
i
am
afraid
oh
monsieur
said
gelis
big
books
have
never
been
able
to
make
me
afraid
of
i
begged
the
young
man
to
wait
for
me
and
i
went
into
the
next
room
to
get
the
register
which
i
could
not
find
at
first
and
which
i
almost
despaired
of
finding
as
i
discerned
from
certain
familiar
signs
that
therese
had
been
setting
the
room
in
order
but
the
register
was
so
big
and
so
heavy
that
luckily
for
me
therese
had
not
been
able
to
put
it
in
order
as
she
had
doubtless
wished
to
do
i
could
scarcely
lift
it
up
myself
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
it
quite
as
heavy
as
i
could
have
hoped
wait
my
boy
i
said
with
a
smile
which
must
have
been
very
sarcastic
wait
i
am
going
to
give
you
something
to
do
which
will
break
your
arms
first
and
afterwards
your
head
that
will
be
the
first
vengeance
of
sylvestre
bonnard
later
on
we
shall
see
what
else
there
is
to
be
when
i
returned
to
the
city
of
books
i
heard
monsieur
gelis
and
mademoiselle
jeanne
chatting
chatting
together
if
you
please
as
if
they
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
mademoiselle
prefere
being
full
of
decorum
did
not
say
anything
but
the
other
two
were
chatting
like
birds
and
what
about
about
the
blond
tint
used
by
venetian
painters
yes
about
the
venetian
that
little
serpent
of
a
gelis
was
telling
jeanne
the
secret
of
the
dye
with
which
according
to
the
best
authorities
the
women
of
titian
and
of
veronese
tinted
their
hair
and
mademoiselle
jeanne
was
expressing
her
opinion
very
prettily
about
the
honey
tint
and
the
golden
tint
i
understood
that
that
scamp
of
a
vecellio
was
responsible
that
they
had
been
bending
over
the
book
together
and
that
they
had
been
admiring
either
that
doge
s
wife
we
had
been
looking
at
awhile
before
or
some
other
patrician
woman
of
venice
never
mind
i
appeared
with
my
enormous
old
book
thinking
that
gelis
was
going
to
make
a
grimace
it
was
as
much
as
one
could
have
asked
a
porter
to
carry
and
my
arms
were
stiff
merely
with
lifting
it
but
the
young
man
caught
it
up
like
a
feather
and
slipped
it
under
his
arm
with
a
smile
then
he
thanked
me
with
that
sort
of
brevity
which
i
like
reminded
me
that
he
had
need
of
my
advice
and
having
made
an
appointment
to
meet
me
another
day
took
his
departure
after
bowing
to
us
with
the
most
perfect
conceivable
he
seems
quite
a
decent
lad
i
said
jeanne
turned
over
a
few
more
pages
of
vecellio
and
made
no
answer
aha
i
thought
to
myself
and
then
we
went
to
the
regularity
with
which
visit
succeeded
visit
to
the
old
man
s
house
thereafter
made
me
feel
very
grateful
to
mademoiselle
prefere
who
succeeded
at
last
in
winning
her
right
to
occupy
a
special
corner
in
the
city
of
books
she
now
says
my
chair
my
footstool
my
pigeon
her
pigeon
hole
is
really
a
small
shelf
properly
belonging
to
the
poets
of
la
champagne
whom
she
expelled
therefrom
in
order
to
obtain
a
lodging
for
her
she
is
very
amiable
and
i
must
really
be
a
monster
not
to
like
her
i
can
only
endure
her
in
the
severest
signification
of
the
word
but
what
would
one
not
endure
for
jeanne
s
sake
her
presence
lends
to
the
city
of
books
a
charm
which
seems
to
hover
about
it
even
after
she
has
gone
she
is
very
ignorant
but
she
is
so
finely
gifted
that
whenever
i
show
her
anything
beautiful
i
am
astounded
to
find
that
i
had
never
really
seen
it
before
and
that
it
is
she
who
makes
me
see
it
i
have
found
it
impossible
so
far
to
make
her
follow
some
of
my
ideas
but
i
have
often
found
pleasure
in
following
the
whimsical
and
delicate
course
of
her
own
a
more
practical
man
than
i
would
attempt
to
teach
her
to
make
herself
useful
but
is
not
the
capacity
of
being
amiable
a
useful
think
in
life
without
being
pretty
she
charms
and
the
power
to
charm
is
perhaps
after
all
worth
quite
as
much
as
the
ability
to
darn
stockings
furthermore
i
am
not
immortal
and
i
doubt
whether
she
will
have
become
very
old
when
my
notary
who
is
not
maitre
mouche
shall
read
to
her
a
certain
paper
which
i
signed
a
little
while
ago
i
do
not
wish
that
any
one
except
myself
should
provide
for
her
and
give
her
her
dowry
i
am
not
however
very
rich
and
the
paternal
inheritance
did
not
gain
bulk
in
my
hands
one
does
not
accumulate
money
by
poring
over
old
texts
but
my
books
at
the
price
which
such
noble
merchandise
fetches
are
worth
something
why
on
that
shelf
there
are
some
poets
of
the
sixteenth
century
for
which
bankers
would
bid
against
princes
and
i
think
that
those
heures
of
simon
vostre
would
not
be
readily
overlooked
at
the
hotel
sylvestre
any
more
than
would
those
preces
piae
compiled
for
the
use
of
queen
claude
i
have
taken
great
pains
to
collect
and
to
preserve
all
those
rare
and
curious
editions
which
people
the
city
of
books
and
for
a
long
time
i
used
to
believe
that
they
were
as
necessary
to
my
life
as
air
and
light
i
have
loved
them
well
and
even
now
i
can
not
prevent
myself
from
smiling
at
them
and
caressing
them
those
morocco
bindings
are
so
delightful
to
the
eye
these
old
vellums
are
so
soft
to
the
touch
there
is
not
a
single
one
among
those
books
which
is
not
worthy
by
reason
of
some
special
merit
to
command
the
respect
of
an
honourable
man
what
other
owner
would
ever
know
how
to
dip
into
hem
in
the
proper
way
can
i
be
even
sure
that
another
owner
would
not
leave
them
to
decay
in
neglect
or
mutilate
them
at
the
prompting
of
some
ignorant
whim
into
whose
hands
will
fall
that
incomparable
copy
of
the
histoire
de
l
abbaye
de
on
the
margins
of
which
the
author
himself
in
the
person
of
jacques
bouillard
made
such
substantial
notes
in
his
own
handwriting
master
bonnard
you
are
an
old
fool
your
housekeeper
poor
soul
is
nailed
down
upon
her
bed
with
a
merciless
attack
of
rheumatism
jeanne
is
to
come
with
her
chaperon
and
instead
of
thinking
how
you
are
going
to
receive
them
you
are
thinking
about
a
thousand
stupidities
sylvestre
bonnard
you
will
never
succeed
at
anything
in
this
world
and
it
is
i
myself
who
tell
you
so
and
at
this
very
moment
i
catch
sight
of
them
from
my
window
as
they
get
out
of
the
omnibus
jeanne
leaps
down
lie
a
kitten
but
mademoiselle
prefere
intrusts
herself
to
the
strong
arm
of
the
conductor
with
the
shy
grace
of
a
virginia
recovering
after
the
shipwreck
and
this
time
quite
resigned
to
being
saved
jeanne
looks
up
sees
me
laughs
and
mademoiselle
prefere
has
to
prevent
her
from
waving
her
umbrella
at
me
as
a
friendly
signal
there
is
a
certain
stage
of
civilisation
to
which
mademoiselle
jeanne
never
can
be
brought
you
can
teach
her
all
the
arts
if
you
like
it
is
not
exactly
to
mademoiselle
prefere
that
i
am
now
speaking
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
teach
her
perfect
manners
as
a
charming
child
she
makes
the
mistake
of
being
charming
only
in
her
own
way
only
an
old
fool
like
myself
could
forgive
her
pranks
as
for
young
fools
and
there
are
several
of
them
still
to
be
found
i
do
not
know
what
they
would
think
about
it
and
what
they
might
think
is
none
of
my
business
just
look
at
her
running
along
the
pavement
wrapped
in
her
cloak
with
her
hat
tilted
back
on
her
head
and
her
feather
fluttering
in
the
wind
like
a
schooner
in
full
rig
and
really
she
has
a
grace
of
poise
and
motion
which
suggests
a
fine
so
much
so
indeed
that
she
makes
me
remember
seeing
one
day
when
i
was
at
havre
but
bonnard
my
friend
how
many
times
is
it
necessary
to
tell
you
that
your
housekeeper
is
in
bed
and
that
you
must
go
and
open
the
door
yourself
open
old
man
winter
tis
spring
who
rings
the
bell
it
is
jeanne
herself
jeanne
is
all
flushed
like
a
rose
mademoiselle
prefere
indignant
and
out
of
breath
has
still
another
whole
flight
to
climb
before
reaching
our
lobby
i
explained
the
condition
of
my
housekeeper
and
proposed
that
we
should
dine
at
a
restaurant
but
therese
still
even
upon
her
decided
that
we
should
dine
at
home
whether
we
wanted
to
or
no
respectable
people
in
her
opinion
never
dined
at
restaurants
moreover
she
had
made
all
necessary
arrangements
the
dinner
had
been
bought
the
concierge
would
cook
it
the
audacious
jeanne
insisted
upon
going
to
see
whether
the
old
woman
wanted
anything
as
you
might
suppose
she
was
sent
back
to
the
parlour
with
short
shrift
but
not
so
harshly
as
i
had
feared
if
i
want
anybody
to
do
anything
for
me
which
thank
god
i
do
not
therese
had
replied
i
would
get
somebody
less
delicate
and
dainty
than
you
are
what
i
want
is
rest
that
is
a
merchandise
which
is
not
sold
at
fairs
under
the
sign
of
motus
with
finger
on
go
and
have
your
fun
and
don
t
stay
here
for
old
age
might
be
jeanne
after
telling
us
what
she
had
said
added
that
she
liked
very
much
to
hear
old
therese
talk
whereupon
mademoiselle
prefere
reproached
her
for
expressing
such
unladylike
tastes
i
tried
to
excuse
her
by
citing
the
example
of
moliere
just
at
that
moment
it
came
to
pass
that
while
climbing
the
ladder
to
get
a
book
she
upset
a
whole
there
was
a
heavy
crash
and
mademoiselle
prefere
being
of
course
a
very
delicate
person
almost
fainted
jeanne
quickly
followed
the
books
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
she
made
one
think
of
a
kitten
suddenly
transformed
into
a
woman
catching
mice
which
had
been
transformed
into
old
books
while
picking
them
up
she
found
one
which
happened
to
interest
her
and
she
began
to
read
it
squatting
down
upon
her
heels
it
was
the
prince
grenouille
she
told
us
mademoiselle
prefere
took
occasion
to
complain
that
jeanne
had
so
little
taste
for
poetry
it
was
impossible
to
get
her
to
recite
casimir
delavigne
s
poem
on
the
death
of
joan
of
arc
without
mistakes
it
was
the
very
most
she
could
do
to
learn
le
petit
the
schoolmistress
did
not
think
that
any
one
should
read
the
prince
grenouille
before
learning
by
heart
the
stanzas
to
duperrier
and
carried
away
by
her
enthusiasm
she
began
to
recite
them
in
a
voice
sweeter
than
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
ta
douleur
duperrier
sera
donc
eternelle
et
les
tristes
discours
que
te
met
en
l
esprit
l
amitie
paternelle
l
augmenteront
toujours
je
sais
de
quels
appas
son
enfance
etait
pleine
et
n
ai
pas
entrepris
injurieux
ami
de
consoler
ta
peine
avecque
son
then
in
ecstacy
she
exclaimed
how
beautiful
that
is
what
harmony
how
is
it
possible
for
any
one
not
to
admire
such
exquisite
such
touching
verses
but
why
did
malherbe
call
that
poor
monsieur
duperrier
his
injurieux
ami
at
a
time
when
he
had
been
so
severely
tied
by
the
death
of
his
daughter
injurieux
ami
you
must
acknowledge
that
the
term
is
very
i
explained
to
this
poetical
person
that
the
phrase
injurieux
ami
which
shocked
her
so
much
was
in
apposition
etc
etc
what
i
said
however
had
so
little
effect
towards
clearing
her
head
that
she
was
seized
with
a
severe
and
prolonged
fit
of
sneezing
meanwhile
it
was
evident
that
the
history
of
prince
grenouille
had
proved
extremely
funny
for
it
was
all
that
jeanne
could
do
as
she
crouched
down
there
on
the
carpet
to
keep
herself
from
bursting
into
a
wild
fit
of
laughter
but
when
she
had
finished
with
the
prince
and
princess
of
the
story
and
the
multitude
of
their
children
she
assumed
a
very
suppliant
expression
and
begged
me
as
a
great
favour
to
allow
her
to
put
on
a
white
apron
and
go
to
the
kitchen
to
help
in
getting
the
dinner
ready
jeanne
i
replied
with
the
gravity
of
a
master
i
think
that
if
it
is
a
question
of
breaking
plates
knocking
off
the
edges
of
dishes
denting
all
the
pans
and
smashing
all
the
skimmers
the
person
whom
therese
has
set
to
work
in
the
kitchen
already
will
be
able
to
perform
her
task
without
assistance
for
it
seems
to
me
at
this
very
moment
i
can
hear
disastrous
noises
in
that
kitchen
but
anyhow
jeanne
i
will
charge
you
with
the
duty
of
preparing
the
dessert
so
go
and
get
your
white
apron
i
will
tie
it
on
for
accordingly
i
solemnly
knotted
the
linen
apron
about
her
waist
and
she
rushed
into
the
kitchen
where
she
proceeded
at
once
as
we
discovered
later
on
to
prepare
various
dishes
unknown
to
vatel
unknown
even
to
that
great
careme
who
began
his
treatise
upon
pieces
montees
with
these
words
the
fine
arts
are
five
in
number
painting
music
poetry
sculpture
and
architecture
whereof
the
principal
branch
is
but
i
had
no
reason
to
be
pleased
with
this
little
arrangement
for
mademoiselle
prefere
on
finding
herself
alone
with
me
began
to
act
after
a
fashion
which
filled
me
with
frightful
anxiety
she
gazed
upon
me
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
flames
and
uttered
enormous
sighs
oh
how
i
pity
you
she
said
a
man
like
you
a
man
so
superior
as
you
are
having
to
live
alone
with
a
coarse
servant
for
she
is
certainly
coarse
that
is
incontestable
how
cruel
such
a
life
must
be
you
have
need
of
repose
you
have
need
of
comfort
of
care
of
every
kind
of
attention
you
might
fall
sick
and
yet
there
is
no
woman
who
would
not
deem
it
an
honour
to
bear
your
name
and
to
share
your
existence
no
there
is
none
my
own
heart
tells
me
and
she
squeezed
both
hands
over
that
heart
of
hers
always
so
ready
to
fly
away
i
was
driven
almost
to
distraction
i
tried
to
make
mademoiselle
prefere
comprehend
that
i
had
no
intention
whatever
of
changing
my
habits
at
so
advanced
an
age
and
that
i
found
just
as
much
happiness
in
life
as
my
character
and
my
circumstances
rendered
possible
no
you
are
not
happy
she
cried
you
need
to
have
always
beside
you
a
mind
capable
of
comprehending
your
own
shake
off
your
lethargy
and
cast
your
eyes
about
you
your
professional
connections
are
of
the
most
extended
character
and
you
must
have
charming
acquaintances
one
can
not
be
a
member
of
the
institute
without
going
into
society
see
judge
compare
no
sensible
woman
would
refuse
you
her
hand
i
am
a
woman
monsieur
my
instinct
never
deceives
me
there
is
something
within
me
which
assures
me
that
you
would
find
happiness
in
marriage
women
are
so
devoted
so
loving
not
all
of
course
but
some
and
then
they
are
so
sensitive
to
glory
remember
that
at
your
age
one
has
need
like
oedipus
of
an
egeria
your
cook
is
no
longer
able
she
is
deaf
she
is
infirm
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
at
night
oh
it
makes
me
shudder
even
to
think
of
it
and
she
really
shuddered
she
closed
her
eyes
clenched
her
hands
stamped
on
the
floor
great
was
my
dismay
with
awful
intensity
she
resumed
your
health
your
dear
health
the
health
of
a
member
of
the
institute
how
joyfully
i
would
shed
the
very
last
drop
of
my
blood
to
preserve
the
life
of
a
scholar
of
a
litterateur
of
a
man
of
worth
and
any
woman
who
would
not
do
as
much
i
should
despise
her
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
i
used
to
know
the
wife
of
a
great
mathematician
a
man
who
used
to
fill
whole
with
calculations
so
many
that
they
filled
all
the
cupboards
in
the
house
he
had
and
he
was
visibly
pining
away
and
i
saw
that
wife
of
his
sitting
there
beside
him
perfectly
calm
i
could
not
endure
it
i
said
to
her
one
day
my
dear
you
have
no
heart
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
i
should
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
she
paused
for
want
of
breath
my
situation
was
terrible
as
for
telling
mademoiselle
prefere
what
i
really
thought
about
her
advice
that
was
something
which
i
could
not
even
dream
of
daring
to
do
for
to
fall
out
with
her
was
to
lose
the
chance
of
seeing
jeanne
so
i
resolved
to
take
the
matter
quietly
in
any
case
she
was
in
my
house
that
consideration
helped
me
to
treat
her
with
something
of
courtesy
i
am
very
old
mademoiselle
i
answered
her
and
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
your
advice
comes
to
me
rather
late
in
life
still
i
will
think
about
it
in
the
meanwhile
let
me
beg
of
you
to
be
calm
i
think
a
glass
of
eau
sucree
would
do
you
good
to
my
great
surprise
these
words
calmed
her
at
once
and
i
saw
her
sit
down
very
quietly
in
her
corner
close
to
her
upon
her
chair
with
her
feet
upon
her
footstool
the
dinner
was
a
complete
failure
mademoiselle
prefere
who
seemed
lost
in
a
brown
study
never
noticed
the
fact
as
a
rule
i
am
very
sensitive
about
such
misfortunes
but
this
one
caused
jeanne
so
much
delight
that
at
last
i
could
not
help
enjoying
it
myself
even
at
my
age
i
had
not
been
able
to
learn
before
that
a
chicken
raw
on
one
side
and
burned
on
the
other
was
a
funny
thing
but
jeanne
s
bursts
of
laughter
taught
me
that
it
was
that
chicken
caused
us
to
say
a
thousand
very
witty
things
which
i
have
forgotten
and
i
was
enchanted
that
it
had
not
been
properly
cooked
jeanne
put
it
back
to
roast
again
then
she
broiled
it
then
she
stewed
it
with
butter
and
every
time
it
came
back
to
the
table
it
was
much
less
appetising
and
much
more
than
before
when
we
did
eat
it
at
last
it
had
become
a
thing
for
which
there
is
no
name
in
any
cuisine
the
almond
cake
was
much
more
extraordinary
it
was
brought
to
the
table
in
the
pan
because
it
never
could
have
got
out
of
it
i
invited
jeanne
to
help
us
all
to
a
piece
thinking
that
i
was
going
to
embarrass
her
but
she
broke
the
pan
and
gave
each
of
us
a
fragment
to
think
that
anybody
at
my
age
could
eat
such
things
was
an
idea
possible
only
to
the
very
artless
mind
mademoiselle
prefere
suddenly
awakened
from
her
dream
indignantly
pushed
away
the
sugary
splinter
of
earthenware
and
deemed
it
opportune
to
inform
me
that
she
herself
was
exceedingly
skilful
in
making
confectionery
ah
exclaimed
jeanne
with
an
air
of
surprise
not
altogether
without
malice
then
she
wrapped
all
the
fragments
of
the
pan
in
a
piece
of
paper
for
the
purpose
of
giving
them
to
her
little
playmates
especially
to
the
three
little
mouton
girls
who
are
naturally
inclined
to
gluttony
secretly
however
i
was
beginning
to
feel
very
uneasy
it
did
not
now
seem
in
any
way
possible
to
keep
much
longer
upon
good
terms
with
mademoiselle
prefere
since
her
matrimonial
fury
had
this
burst
forth
and
that
lady
affronted
to
jeanne
i
took
advantage
of
a
moment
while
the
sweet
soul
was
busy
putting
on
her
cloak
in
order
to
ask
jeanne
to
tell
me
exactly
what
her
own
age
was
she
was
eighteen
years
and
one
month
old
i
counted
on
my
fingers
and
found
she
would
not
come
of
age
for
another
two
years
and
eleven
months
and
how
should
we
be
able
to
manage
during
all
that
time
at
the
door
mademoiselle
prefere
squeezed
my
hand
with
so
much
meaning
that
i
fairly
shook
from
head
to
foot
i
said
very
gravely
to
the
young
girl
but
listen
to
me
a
moment
your
friend
is
very
old
and
might
perhaps
fail
you
when
you
need
him
most
promise
me
never
to
fail
in
your
duty
to
yourself
and
then
i
shall
have
no
fear
god
keep
you
my
child
after
closing
the
door
behind
them
i
opened
the
window
to
get
a
last
look
at
her
as
she
was
going
away
but
the
night
was
dark
and
i
could
see
only
two
vague
shadows
flitting
across
the
quay
i
heard
the
vast
deep
hom
of
the
city
rising
up
about
me
and
i
suddenly
felt
a
great
sinking
at
my
heart
poor
child
december
the
king
of
thule
kept
a
goblet
of
gold
which
his
dying
mistress
had
bequeathed
him
as
a
souvenir
when
about
to
die
himself
after
having
drunk
from
it
for
the
last
time
he
threw
the
goblet
into
the
sea
and
i
keep
this
diary
of
memories
even
as
that
old
prince
of
the
seas
kept
his
carven
goblet
and
even
as
he
flung
away
at
last
his
so
will
i
burn
this
book
of
souvenirs
assuredly
it
is
not
through
any
arrogant
avarice
nor
through
any
egotistical
pride
that
i
shall
destroy
this
record
of
a
humble
life
it
is
only
because
i
fear
lest
those
things
which
are
dear
and
sacred
to
me
might
appear
before
others
because
of
my
inartistic
manner
of
expression
either
commonplace
or
absurd
i
do
not
say
this
in
view
of
what
is
going
to
follow
absurd
i
certainly
must
have
been
when
having
been
invited
to
dinner
by
mademoiselle
prefere
i
took
my
seat
in
a
bergere
it
was
really
a
bergere
at
the
right
hand
of
that
alarming
person
the
table
had
been
set
in
a
little
parlour
and
i
could
observe
from
the
poor
way
in
which
it
was
set
out
that
the
schoolmistress
was
one
of
those
ethereal
souls
who
soar
above
terrestrial
things
chipped
plates
unmatched
glasses
knives
with
loose
handles
forks
with
yellow
prongs
there
was
absolutely
nothing
wanting
to
spoil
the
appetite
of
an
honest
man
i
was
assured
that
the
dinner
had
been
cooked
for
me
for
me
alone
although
maitre
mouche
had
also
been
invited
mademoiselle
prefere
must
have
imagined
that
i
had
sarmatian
tastes
on
the
subject
of
butter
for
that
which
she
offered
me
served
up
in
little
thin
pats
was
excessively
rancid
the
roast
very
nearly
poisoned
me
but
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
maitre
mouche
and
mademoiselle
prefere
discourse
upon
virtue
i
said
the
pleasure
i
ought
to
have
said
the
shame
for
the
sentiments
to
which
they
gave
expression
soared
far
beyond
the
range
of
my
vulgar
nature
what
they
said
proved
to
me
as
clear
as
day
that
devotedness
was
their
daily
bread
and
that
was
not
less
necessary
to
their
existence
than
air
and
water
observing
that
i
was
not
eating
mademoiselle
prefere
made
a
thousand
efforts
to
overcome
that
which
she
was
good
enough
to
term
my
jeanne
was
not
of
the
party
because
i
was
told
her
presence
at
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
rules
and
would
have
wounded
the
feelings
of
the
other
among
whom
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
a
certain
equality
i
secretly
congratulated
her
upon
having
escaped
from
the
merovingian
butter
from
the
huge
radishes
empty
as
form
the
leathery
roast
and
from
various
other
curiosities
of
diet
to
which
i
had
exposed
myself
for
the
love
of
her
the
extremely
servant
served
up
some
liquid
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
cream
i
do
not
know
why
and
vanished
away
like
a
ghost
then
mademoiselle
prefere
related
to
maitre
mouche
with
extraordinary
transports
of
emotion
all
that
she
had
said
to
me
in
the
city
of
books
during
the
time
that
my
housekeeper
was
sick
in
bed
her
admiration
for
a
member
of
the
institute
her
terror
lest
i
should
be
taken
ill
while
unattended
and
the
certainty
she
felt
that
any
intelligent
woman
would
be
proud
and
happy
to
share
my
existence
she
concealed
nothing
but
on
the
contrary
added
many
fresh
follies
to
the
recital
maitre
mouche
kept
nodding
his
head
in
approval
while
cracking
nuts
then
after
all
this
verbiage
he
demanded
with
an
agreeable
smile
what
my
answer
had
been
mademoiselle
prefere
pressing
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
extending
the
other
towards
me
cried
out
he
is
so
affectionate
so
superior
so
good
and
so
great
he
answered
but
i
could
never
because
i
am
only
a
humble
woman
i
could
never
repeat
the
words
of
a
member
of
the
institute
i
can
only
utter
the
substance
of
them
he
answered
yes
i
understand
you
and
with
these
words
she
reached
out
and
seized
one
of
my
hands
then
maitre
mouche
also
overwhelmed
with
emotion
arose
and
seized
my
other
hand
monsieur
he
said
permit
me
to
offer
my
several
times
in
my
life
i
have
known
fear
but
never
before
had
i
experienced
any
fright
of
so
nauseating
a
character
a
sickening
terror
came
upon
me
i
disengaged
by
two
hands
and
rising
to
my
feet
so
as
to
give
all
possible
seriousness
to
my
words
i
said
madame
either
i
explained
myself
very
badly
when
you
were
at
my
house
or
i
have
totally
misunderstood
you
here
in
your
own
in
either
case
a
positive
declaration
is
absolutely
necessary
permit
me
madame
to
make
it
now
very
plainly
no
i
never
did
understand
you
i
am
totally
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
this
marriage
project
that
you
have
been
planning
for
me
if
you
really
have
been
planning
one
in
any
event
i
should
not
think
of
marrying
it
would
be
unpardonable
folly
at
my
age
and
even
now
at
this
moment
i
can
not
conceive
how
a
sensible
person
like
you
could
ever
have
advised
me
to
marry
indeed
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
and
that
you
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
before
in
the
latter
case
please
excuse
an
old
man
totally
unfamiliar
with
the
usages
of
society
unaccustomed
to
the
conversation
of
ladies
and
very
contrite
for
his
maitre
mouche
went
back
very
softly
to
his
place
where
not
finding
any
more
nuts
to
crack
he
began
to
whittle
a
cork
mademoiselle
prefere
after
staring
at
me
for
a
few
moments
with
an
expression
in
her
little
round
dry
eyes
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
suddenly
resumed
her
customary
sweetness
and
graciousness
then
she
cried
out
in
honeyed
tones
oh
these
learned
men
these
studious
men
they
are
like
children
yes
monsieur
bonnard
you
are
a
real
child
then
turning
to
the
notary
who
still
sat
very
quietly
in
his
corner
with
his
nose
over
his
cork
she
exclaimed
in
beseeching
tones
oh
do
not
accuse
him
do
not
accuse
him
do
not
think
any
evil
of
him
i
beg
of
you
do
not
think
it
at
all
must
i
ask
you
upon
my
knees
maitre
mouche
continued
to
examine
all
the
various
aspects
and
surfaces
of
his
cork
without
making
any
further
manifestation
i
was
very
indignant
and
i
know
that
my
cheeks
must
have
been
extremely
red
if
i
could
judge
by
the
flush
of
heat
which
i
felt
rise
to
my
face
this
would
enable
me
to
explain
the
words
i
heard
through
all
the
buzzing
in
my
ears
i
am
frightened
about
him
our
poor
friend
monsieur
mouche
be
kind
enough
to
open
a
window
it
seems
to
me
that
a
compress
of
arnica
would
do
him
some
i
rushed
out
into
the
street
with
an
unspeakable
feeling
of
shame
my
poor
jeanne
december
i
passed
eight
days
without
hearing
anything
further
in
regard
to
the
prefere
establishment
then
feeling
myself
unable
to
remain
any
longer
without
some
news
of
clementine
s
daughter
and
feeling
furthermore
that
i
owed
it
as
a
duty
to
myself
not
to
cease
my
visits
with
the
school
without
more
serious
cause
i
took
my
way
to
les
ternes
the
parlour
seemed
to
me
more
cold
more
damp
more
inhospitable
and
more
insidious
than
ever
before
and
the
servant
much
more
silent
and
much
more
scared
i
asked
to
see
mademoiselle
jeanne
but
after
a
very
considerable
time
it
was
mademoiselle
prefere
who
made
her
appearance
instead
severe
and
pale
with
lips
compressed
and
a
hard
look
in
her
eyes
monsieur
she
said
folding
her
arms
over
her
pelerine
i
regret
very
much
that
i
can
not
allow
you
to
see
mademoiselle
alexandre
but
i
can
not
possibly
do
why
not
i
asked
in
astonishment
monsieur
she
replied
the
reasons
which
compel
me
to
request
that
your
visits
shall
be
less
frequent
hereafter
are
of
an
excessively
delicate
nature
and
i
must
beg
you
to
spare
me
the
unpleasantness
of
mentioning
madame
i
replied
i
have
been
authorized
by
jeanne
s
guardian
to
see
his
ward
every
day
will
you
please
to
inform
me
of
your
reasons
for
opposing
the
will
of
monsieur
mouche
the
guardian
of
mademoiselle
alexandre
she
replied
and
she
dwelt
upon
that
word
guardian
as
upon
a
solid
support
desires
quite
as
strongly
as
i
myself
do
that
your
assiduities
may
come
to
an
end
as
soon
as
then
if
that
be
the
case
i
said
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
know
his
reasons
and
your
she
looked
up
at
the
little
spiral
of
paper
on
the
ceiling
and
then
replied
with
stern
composure
you
insist
upon
it
well
although
such
explanations
are
very
painful
for
a
woman
to
make
i
will
yield
to
your
exaction
this
house
monsieur
is
an
honourable
house
i
have
my
responsibility
i
have
to
watch
like
a
mother
over
each
one
of
my
pupils
your
assiduities
in
regard
to
mademoiselle
alexandre
could
not
possibly
be
continued
without
serious
injury
to
the
young
girl
herself
and
it
is
my
duty
to
insist
that
they
shall
i
do
not
really
understand
you
i
replied
and
i
was
telling
the
plain
truth
then
she
deliberately
resumed
your
assiduities
in
this
house
are
being
interpreted
by
the
most
respectable
and
the
least
suspicious
persons
in
such
a
manner
that
i
find
myself
obliged
both
in
the
interest
of
my
establishment
and
in
the
interest
of
mademoiselle
alexandre
to
see
that
they
end
at
madame
i
cried
i
have
heard
a
great
many
silly
things
in
my
life
but
never
anything
so
silly
as
what
you
have
just
said
she
answered
me
quietly
your
words
of
abuse
will
not
affect
me
in
the
slightest
when
one
has
a
duty
to
accomplish
one
is
strong
enough
to
endure
and
she
pressed
her
pelerine
over
her
heart
once
more
not
perhaps
on
this
occasion
to
restrain
but
doubtless
only
to
caress
that
generous
heart
madame
i
said
shaking
my
finger
at
her
you
have
wantonly
aroused
the
indignation
of
an
aged
man
be
good
enough
to
act
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
old
man
may
be
able
at
least
to
forget
your
existence
and
do
not
add
fresh
insults
to
those
which
i
have
already
sustained
from
your
lips
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
shall
never
cease
to
look
after
mademoiselle
alexandre
and
that
should
you
attempt
to
do
her
any
harm
in
any
manner
whatsoever
you
will
have
serious
reason
to
regret
it
the
more
i
became
excited
the
more
she
became
cool
and
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
superb
indifference
monsieur
i
am
much
too
well
informed
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
interest
which
you
take
in
this
young
girl
not
to
withdraw
her
immediately
from
that
very
surveillance
with
which
you
threaten
me
after
observing
the
more
than
equivocal
intimacy
in
which
you
are
living
with
your
housekeeper
i
ought
to
have
taken
measures
at
once
to
render
it
impossible
for
you
ever
to
come
into
contact
with
an
innocent
child
in
the
future
i
shall
certainly
do
it
if
up
to
this
time
i
have
been
too
trustful
it
is
for
mademoiselle
alexandre
and
not
for
you
to
reproach
me
with
it
but
she
is
too
artless
and
too
pure
thanks
to
me
ever
to
have
suspected
the
nature
of
that
danger
into
which
you
were
trying
to
lead
her
i
scarcely
suppose
that
you
will
place
me
under
the
necessity
of
enlightening
her
upon
the
come
my
poor
old
bonnard
i
said
to
myself
as
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
so
you
had
to
live
as
long
as
this
in
order
to
learn
for
the
first
time
exactly
what
a
wicked
woman
is
and
now
your
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
i
went
out
without
replying
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
observing
from
the
sudden
flush
which
overspread
the
face
of
the
schoolmistress
that
my
silence
had
wounded
her
far
more
than
my
words
as
i
passed
through
the
court
i
looked
about
me
in
every
direction
for
jeanne
she
was
watching
for
me
and
she
ran
to
me
if
anybody
touches
one
little
hair
of
your
head
jeanne
write
to
me
no
not
i
replied
well
no
not
write
to
me
i
went
straight
to
madame
de
gabry
s
residence
madame
is
at
rome
with
monsieur
did
not
monsieur
know
it
why
yes
i
replied
madame
wrote
to
she
had
indeed
written
to
me
in
regard
to
her
leaving
home
but
my
head
must
have
become
very
much
confused
so
that
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
the
servant
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
looked
at
me
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
signify
monsieur
bonnard
is
doting
and
he
leaned
down
over
the
balustrade
of
the
stairway
to
see
if
i
was
not
going
to
do
something
extraordinary
before
i
got
to
the
bottom
but
i
descended
the
stairs
rationally
enough
and
then
he
drew
back
his
head
in
disappointment
on
returning
home
i
was
informed
that
monsieur
gelis
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
parlour
this
young
man
has
become
a
constant
visitor
his
judgement
is
at
fault
at
times
but
his
mind
is
not
at
all
commonplace
on
this
occasion
however
his
usually
welcome
visit
only
embarrassed
me
alas
i
thought
to
myself
i
shall
be
sure
to
say
something
very
stupid
to
my
young
friend
and
he
also
will
think
that
my
facilities
are
becoming
impaired
but
still
i
can
not
really
explain
to
him
that
i
had
first
been
demanded
in
wedlock
and
subsequently
traduced
as
a
man
wholly
devoid
of
morals
that
even
therese
had
become
an
object
of
suspicion
and
that
jeanne
remains
in
the
power
of
the
most
rascally
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
am
certainly
in
an
admirable
state
of
mind
for
conversing
about
cistercian
abbeys
with
a
young
and
mischievously
minded
man
nevertheless
we
shall
see
we
shall
but
therese
stopped
me
how
red
you
are
monsieur
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
reproach
it
must
be
the
spring
i
answered
she
cried
out
the
spring
in
the
month
of
december
that
is
a
fact
this
is
december
ah
what
is
the
matter
with
my
head
what
a
fine
help
i
am
going
to
be
to
poor
jeanne
therese
take
my
cane
and
put
it
if
you
possibly
can
in
some
place
where
i
shall
be
able
to
find
it
again
monsieur
gelis
how
are
you
undated
next
morning
the
old
boy
wanted
to
get
up
but
the
old
boy
could
not
get
up
a
merciless
invisible
hand
kept
him
down
upon
his
bed
finding
himself
immovably
riveted
there
the
old
boy
resigned
himself
to
remain
motionless
but
his
thoughts
kept
running
in
all
directions
he
must
have
had
a
very
violent
fever
for
mademoiselle
prefere
the
abbots
of
and
the
servant
of
madame
de
gabry
appeared
to
him
in
divers
fantastic
shapes
the
figure
of
the
servant
in
particular
lengthened
weirdly
over
his
head
grimacing
like
some
gargoyle
of
a
cathedral
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
a
great
many
people
much
too
many
people
in
my
bedroom
this
bedroom
of
mine
is
furnished
after
the
antiquated
fashion
the
portrait
of
my
father
in
full
uniform
and
the
portrait
of
my
mother
in
her
cashmere
dress
are
suspended
on
the
wall
the
is
covered
with
green
foliage
designs
i
am
aware
of
all
this
and
i
am
even
conscious
that
everything
is
faded
very
much
faded
but
an
old
man
s
room
does
not
require
to
be
pretty
it
is
enough
that
it
should
be
clean
and
therese
sees
to
that
at
all
events
my
room
is
sufficiently
decorated
to
please
a
mind
like
mine
which
has
always
remained
somewhat
childish
and
dreamy
there
are
things
hanging
on
the
wall
or
scattered
over
the
tables
and
shelves
which
usually
please
my
fancy
and
amuse
me
but
it
would
seem
as
if
all
those
objects
had
suddenly
conceived
some
kind
of
against
me
they
have
all
become
garish
grimacing
menacing
that
statuette
modelled
after
one
of
the
theological
virtues
of
de
brou
always
so
ingenuously
graceful
in
its
natural
condition
is
now
making
contortions
and
putting
out
its
tongue
at
me
and
that
beautiful
miniature
in
which
one
of
the
most
skilful
pupils
of
jehan
fouquet
depicted
himself
girdled
with
the
of
the
sons
of
francis
offering
his
book
on
bended
knee
to
the
good
duc
d
angouleme
who
has
taken
it
out
of
its
frame
and
put
in
its
place
a
great
ugly
cat
s
head
which
stares
at
me
with
phosphorescent
eyes
and
the
designs
on
the
have
also
turned
into
heads
hideous
green
heads
but
no
i
am
sure
that
must
have
upon
it
at
this
moment
just
as
it
had
twenty
years
ago
and
nothing
else
but
no
again
i
was
right
before
they
are
heads
with
eyes
noses
mouths
they
are
heads
ah
now
i
understand
they
are
both
heads
and
at
the
same
time
i
wish
i
could
not
see
them
at
all
and
there
on
my
right
the
pretty
miniature
of
the
franciscan
has
come
back
again
but
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
can
only
keep
it
in
its
frame
by
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
and
that
the
moment
i
get
tired
the
ugly
will
appear
in
its
place
certainly
i
am
not
delirious
i
can
see
therese
very
plainly
standing
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
i
can
hear
her
speaking
to
me
perfectly
well
and
i
should
be
able
to
answer
her
quite
satisfactorily
if
i
were
not
kept
so
busy
in
trying
to
compel
the
various
objects
about
me
to
maintain
their
natural
aspect
here
is
the
doctor
coming
i
never
sent
for
him
but
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
see
him
he
is
an
old
neighbor
of
mine
i
have
never
been
of
much
service
to
him
but
i
like
him
very
much
even
if
i
do
not
say
much
to
him
i
have
at
least
full
possession
of
all
my
faculties
and
i
even
find
myself
extraordinarily
crafty
and
observant
for
i
note
all
his
gestures
his
every
look
the
least
wrinkling
of
his
face
but
the
doctor
is
very
cunning
too
and
i
can
not
really
tell
what
he
thinks
about
me
the
deep
thought
of
goethe
suddenly
comes
to
my
mind
and
i
exclaim
doctor
the
old
man
has
consented
to
allow
himself
to
become
sick
but
he
does
not
intend
this
time
at
least
to
make
any
further
concessions
to
neither
the
doctor
nor
therese
laughs
at
my
little
joke
i
suppose
they
can
not
have
understood
it
the
doctor
goes
away
evening
comes
and
all
sorts
of
strange
shadows
begin
to
shape
themselves
about
my
forming
and
dissolving
by
turns
and
other
shadows
ghosts
throng
by
before
me
and
through
them
i
can
see
distinctively
the
impassive
face
of
my
faithful
servant
and
suddenly
a
cry
a
shrill
cry
a
great
cry
of
distress
rends
my
ears
was
it
you
who
called
me
jeanne
the
day
is
over
and
the
shadows
take
their
places
at
my
bedside
to
remain
with
me
all
through
the
long
night
then
morning
comes
i
feel
a
peace
a
vast
peace
wrapping
me
all
about
art
thou
about
to
take
me
into
thy
rest
my
dear
lord
god
february
the
doctor
is
quite
jovial
it
seems
that
i
am
doing
him
a
great
deal
of
credit
by
being
able
to
get
out
of
bed
if
i
must
believe
him
innumerable
disorders
must
have
pounced
down
upon
my
poor
old
body
all
at
the
same
time
these
disorders
which
are
the
terror
of
ordinary
mankind
have
names
which
are
the
terror
of
philologists
they
are
hybrid
names
half
greek
half
latin
with
terminations
in
itis
indicating
the
inflammatory
condition
and
in
algia
indicating
pain
the
doctor
gives
me
all
their
names
together
with
a
corresponding
number
of
adjectives
ending
in
ic
which
serve
to
characterise
their
detestable
qualities
in
short
they
represent
a
good
half
of
that
most
perfect
copy
of
the
dictionary
of
medicine
contained
in
the
box
of
pandora
doctor
what
an
excellent
story
the
story
of
pandora
is
if
i
were
a
poet
i
would
put
it
into
french
verse
shake
hands
doctor
you
have
brought
me
back
to
life
i
forgive
you
for
it
you
have
given
me
back
to
my
friends
i
thank
you
for
it
you
say
i
am
quite
strong
that
may
be
that
may
be
but
i
have
lasted
a
very
long
time
i
am
a
very
old
article
of
furniture
i
might
be
very
satisfactorily
compared
to
my
father
s
it
was
an
which
the
good
man
had
inherited
and
in
which
he
used
to
lounge
from
morning
until
evening
twenty
times
a
day
when
i
was
quite
a
baby
i
used
to
climb
up
and
seat
myself
on
one
of
the
arms
of
that
chair
so
long
as
the
chair
remained
intact
nobody
paid
any
particular
attention
to
it
but
it
began
to
limp
on
one
foot
and
then
folks
began
to
say
that
it
was
a
very
good
chair
afterwards
it
became
lame
in
three
legs
squeaked
with
the
fourth
leg
and
lost
nearly
half
of
both
arms
then
everybody
would
exclaim
what
a
strong
chair
they
wondered
how
it
was
that
after
its
arms
had
been
worn
off
and
all
its
legs
knocked
out
of
perpendicular
it
could
yet
preserve
the
recognisable
shape
of
a
chair
remains
nearly
erect
and
still
be
of
some
service
the
came
out
of
its
body
at
last
and
it
gave
up
the
ghost
and
when
cyprien
our
servant
sawed
up
its
mutilated
members
for
everybody
redoubled
their
cries
of
admiration
oh
what
an
excellent
what
a
marvellous
chair
it
was
the
chair
of
pierre
sylvestre
bonnard
the
cloth
merchant
of
epimenide
bonnard
his
son
of
bonnard
the
pyrrhonian
philosopher
and
chief
of
the
third
maritime
division
oh
what
a
robust
and
venerable
chair
in
reality
it
was
a
dead
chair
well
doctor
i
am
that
chair
you
think
i
am
solid
because
i
have
been
able
to
resist
an
attack
which
would
have
killed
many
people
and
which
only
killed
me
much
obliged
i
feel
none
the
less
that
i
am
something
which
has
been
irremediably
the
doctor
tries
to
prove
to
me
with
the
help
of
enormous
greek
and
latin
words
that
i
am
really
in
a
very
good
condition
it
would
of
course
be
useless
to
attempt
any
demonstration
of
this
kind
in
so
lucid
a
language
as
french
however
i
allow
him
to
persuade
me
at
last
and
i
see
him
to
the
door
good
good
exclaimed
therese
that
is
the
way
to
put
the
doctor
out
of
the
house
just
do
the
same
thing
once
or
twice
again
and
he
will
not
come
to
see
you
any
more
and
so
much
the
better
well
therese
now
that
i
have
become
such
a
hearty
man
again
do
not
refuse
to
give
me
my
letters
i
am
sure
there
must
be
quite
a
big
bundle
of
letters
and
it
would
be
very
wicked
to
keep
me
any
longer
from
reading
therese
after
some
little
grumbling
gave
me
my
letters
but
what
did
it
matter
i
looked
at
all
the
envelopes
and
saw
that
no
one
of
them
had
been
addressed
by
the
little
hand
which
i
so
much
wish
i
could
see
here
now
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
vecellio
i
pushed
the
whole
bundle
of
letters
away
they
had
no
more
interest
for
me
it
was
a
hotly
contested
engagement
wait
monsieur
until
i
have
put
on
my
clean
things
exclaimed
therese
and
i
will
go
out
with
you
this
time
also
i
will
carry
your
as
i
have
been
doing
these
last
few
days
and
we
will
go
and
sit
down
somewhere
in
the
therese
actually
thinks
me
infirm
i
have
been
sick
it
is
true
but
there
is
an
end
to
all
things
madame
malady
has
taken
her
departure
quite
awhile
ago
and
it
is
now
more
than
three
months
since
her
pale
and
handmaid
dame
convalescence
politely
bade
me
farewell
if
i
were
to
listen
to
my
housekeeper
i
should
become
a
veritable
monsieur
argant
and
i
should
wear
a
nightcap
with
ribbons
for
the
rest
of
my
life
no
more
of
this
i
propose
to
go
out
by
myself
therese
will
not
hear
of
it
she
takes
my
and
wants
to
follow
me
therese
if
you
like
we
will
take
our
seats
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
wall
of
la
petite
provence
and
stay
there
just
as
long
as
you
please
but
i
have
some
very
important
affairs
to
attend
so
much
the
better
but
your
affairs
are
not
the
only
affairs
in
this
i
beg
i
scold
i
make
my
escape
it
is
quite
a
pleasant
day
with
the
aid
of
a
cab
and
the
help
of
almighty
god
i
trust
to
be
able
to
fulfil
my
purpose
there
is
the
wall
on
which
is
painted
in
great
blue
letters
the
words
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
tenu
par
mademoiselle
virginie
there
is
the
iron
gate
which
would
give
free
entrance
into
the
if
it
were
ever
opened
but
the
lock
is
rusty
and
sheets
of
zinc
put
up
behind
the
bars
protect
the
indiscreet
observation
those
dear
little
souls
to
whom
mademoiselle
prefere
doubtless
teaches
modesty
sincerity
justice
and
disinterestedness
there
is
a
window
with
iron
bars
before
it
and
panes
daubed
over
with
white
paint
the
window
of
the
domestic
offices
like
a
glazed
eye
the
only
aperture
of
the
building
opening
upon
the
exterior
world
as
for
the
through
which
i
entered
so
often
but
which
is
now
closed
against
me
for
ever
it
is
just
as
i
saw
it
the
last
time
with
its
little
wicket
the
single
stone
step
in
front
of
it
is
deeply
worn
and
without
having
very
good
eyes
behind
my
spectacles
i
can
see
the
little
white
scratches
on
the
stone
which
have
been
made
by
the
nails
in
the
shoes
of
the
girls
going
in
and
out
and
why
can
not
i
also
go
in
i
have
a
feeling
that
jeanne
must
be
suffering
a
great
deal
in
this
dismal
house
and
that
she
calls
my
name
in
secret
i
can
not
go
away
from
the
gate
a
strange
anxiety
takes
hold
of
me
i
pull
the
bell
the
servant
comes
to
the
door
even
more
than
when
i
saw
her
the
last
time
strict
orders
have
been
given
i
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
see
mademoiselle
jeanne
i
beg
the
servant
to
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
how
the
child
is
the
servant
after
looking
to
her
right
and
then
to
her
left
tells
me
that
mademoiselle
jeanne
is
well
and
then
shuts
the
door
in
my
face
and
i
am
all
alone
in
the
street
again
how
many
times
since
then
have
i
wandered
in
the
same
way
under
that
wall
and
passed
before
the
little
door
full
of
shame
and
despair
to
find
myself
even
weaker
than
that
poor
child
who
has
no
other
help
of
friend
except
myself
in
the
world
finally
i
overcame
my
repugnance
sufficiently
to
call
upon
maitre
mouche
the
first
thing
i
remarked
was
that
his
office
is
much
more
dusty
and
much
more
mouldy
this
year
that
it
was
last
year
the
notary
made
his
appearance
after
a
moment
with
his
familiar
stiff
gestures
and
his
restless
eyes
quivering
behind
his
i
made
my
complaints
to
him
he
answered
me
but
why
should
i
write
down
even
in
a
notebook
which
i
am
going
to
burn
my
recollections
of
a
downright
scoundrel
he
takes
sides
with
mademoiselle
prefere
whose
intelligent
mind
and
irreproachable
character
he
has
long
appreciated
he
does
not
feel
himself
in
a
position
to
decide
the
nature
of
the
question
at
issue
but
he
must
assure
me
that
appearances
have
been
greatly
against
me
that
of
course
makes
no
difference
to
me
he
adds
and
this
does
make
some
sense
to
me
that
the
small
sum
which
had
been
placed
in
his
hands
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
education
of
his
ward
has
been
expended
and
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
he
can
not
but
gently
admire
the
disinterestedness
of
mademoiselle
prefere
in
consenting
to
allow
mademoiselle
jeanne
to
remain
with
her
a
magnificent
light
the
light
of
a
perfect
day
floods
the
sordid
place
with
its
incorruptible
torrent
and
illuminates
teh
person
of
that
man
and
outside
it
pours
down
its
splendour
upon
all
the
wretchedness
of
a
populous
quarter
how
sweet
it
is
this
light
with
which
my
eyes
have
so
long
been
filled
and
which
ere
long
i
must
for
ever
cease
to
enjoy
i
wander
out
with
my
hands
behind
me
dreaming
as
i
go
following
the
line
of
the
fortifications
and
i
find
myself
after
awhile
i
know
not
how
in
an
suburb
full
of
miserable
little
gardens
by
the
dusty
roadside
i
observe
a
plant
whose
flower
at
once
dark
and
splendid
seems
worthy
of
association
with
the
noblest
and
purest
mourning
for
the
dead
it
is
a
columbine
our
fathers
called
it
our
lady
s
glove
le
gant
de
only
such
a
as
might
make
herself
very
very
small
for
the
sake
of
appearing
to
little
children
could
ever
slip
her
dainty
fingers
into
the
narrow
capsue
of
that
flower
and
there
is
a
big
who
tries
to
force
himself
into
the
flower
brutally
but
his
mouth
can
not
reach
the
nectar
and
the
poor
glutton
strives
and
strives
in
vain
he
has
to
give
up
the
attempt
and
comes
out
of
the
flower
all
smeared
over
with
pollen
he
flies
off
in
his
own
heavy
lumbering
way
but
there
are
not
many
flowers
in
this
portion
of
the
suburbs
which
has
been
defiled
by
the
soot
and
smoke
of
factories
so
he
comes
back
to
the
columbine
again
and
this
time
he
pierces
the
corolla
and
sucks
the
honey
through
the
little
hole
which
he
has
made
i
should
never
have
thought
that
a
had
so
much
sense
why
that
is
admirable
the
more
i
observe
them
the
more
do
insects
and
flowers
fill
me
with
astonishment
i
am
like
that
good
rollin
who
went
wild
with
delight
over
the
flowers
of
his
i
wish
i
could
have
a
fine
garden
and
live
at
the
verge
of
a
wood
august
september
it
occurred
to
me
one
sunday
morning
to
watch
for
the
moment
when
mademoiselle
prefere
s
pupils
were
leaving
the
school
in
procession
to
attend
mass
at
the
parish
church
i
watched
them
passing
two
by
two
the
little
ones
first
with
very
serious
faces
there
were
three
of
them
all
dressed
exactly
alike
dumpy
plump
little
creatures
whom
i
recognized
at
once
as
the
mouton
girls
their
elder
sister
is
the
artist
who
drew
that
terrible
head
of
tatius
king
of
the
sabines
beside
the
column
the
assistant
with
her
in
her
hand
was
gesturing
and
frowning
then
came
the
next
oldest
class
and
finally
the
big
girls
all
whispering
to
each
other
as
they
went
by
but
i
did
not
see
jeanne
i
went
to
and
inquired
whether
they
chanced
to
have
filed
away
somewhere
or
other
any
information
regarding
the
establishment
in
the
rue
demours
i
succeeded
in
inducing
them
to
send
some
female
inspectors
there
these
returned
bringing
with
them
the
most
favourable
reports
about
the
establishment
in
their
opinion
the
prefere
school
was
a
model
school
it
is
evident
that
if
i
were
to
force
an
investigation
mademoiselle
prefere
would
receive
academic
honours
october
this
thursday
being
a
i
had
teh
chance
of
meeting
the
three
little
mouton
girls
in
the
vicinity
of
the
rue
demours
after
bowing
to
their
mother
i
asked
the
eldest
who
appears
to
be
about
ten
years
old
how
was
her
playmate
mademoiselle
jeanne
alexandre
the
little
mouton
girl
answered
me
all
in
a
breath
jeanne
alexandre
is
not
my
playmate
she
is
only
kept
in
the
school
for
charity
so
they
make
her
sweep
the
it
was
mademoiselle
who
said
so
and
jeanne
alexandre
is
a
bad
girl
so
they
lock
her
up
in
the
dark
room
and
it
serves
her
right
and
i
am
a
good
girl
and
i
am
never
locked
up
in
the
dark
the
three
little
girls
resumed
their
walk
and
madame
mouton
followed
close
behind
them
looking
back
over
her
broad
shoulder
at
me
in
a
very
suspicious
manner
alas
i
find
myself
reduced
to
expedients
of
a
questionable
character
madame
de
gabry
will
not
come
back
to
paris
for
at
least
three
months
more
at
the
very
soonest
without
her
i
have
no
tact
i
have
no
common
sense
i
am
nothing
but
a
cumbersome
clumsy
machine
nevertheless
i
can
not
possibly
permit
them
to
make
jeanne
a
servant
december
the
idea
that
jeanne
was
obliged
to
sweep
the
rooms
had
become
absolutely
unbearable
the
weather
was
dark
and
cold
night
had
already
begun
i
rang
the
bell
with
the
tranquillity
of
a
resolute
man
the
moment
that
the
timid
servant
opened
the
door
i
slipped
a
gold
piece
into
her
hand
and
promised
her
another
if
she
would
arrange
matters
so
that
i
could
see
mademoiselle
alexandre
her
answer
was
in
one
hour
from
now
at
the
grated
and
she
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
so
rudely
that
she
knocked
my
hat
into
the
gutter
i
waited
for
one
very
long
hour
in
a
violent
then
i
approached
the
window
nothing
the
wind
raged
and
the
snow
fell
heavily
workmen
passing
by
with
their
implements
on
their
shoulders
and
their
heads
bent
down
to
keep
the
snow
from
coming
in
their
faces
rudely
jostled
me
still
nothing
i
began
to
fear
i
had
been
observed
i
knew
that
i
had
done
wrong
in
bribing
a
servant
but
i
was
not
a
bit
sorry
for
it
woe
to
the
man
who
does
not
know
how
to
break
through
social
regulations
in
case
of
necessity
another
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
nothing
at
last
the
window
was
partly
opened
is
that
you
monsieur
bonnard
is
that
you
jeanne
tell
me
at
once
what
has
become
of
i
am
well
very
but
what
else
they
have
put
me
in
the
kitchen
and
i
have
to
sweep
the
in
the
kitchen
sweeping
you
gracious
goodness
yes
because
my
guardian
does
not
pay
for
my
schooling
any
gracious
goodness
your
guardian
seems
to
me
to
be
a
thorough
then
you
know
what
oh
don
t
ask
me
to
tell
you
that
but
i
would
rather
die
than
find
myself
alone
with
him
and
why
did
you
not
write
to
me
i
was
at
this
instant
i
formed
a
resolve
which
nothing
in
this
world
could
have
induced
me
to
change
i
did
indeed
have
some
idea
that
i
might
be
acting
contrary
to
law
but
i
did
not
give
myself
the
least
concern
about
that
idea
and
being
firmly
resolved
i
was
able
to
be
prudent
i
acted
with
remarkable
coolness
jeanne
i
asked
tell
me
does
that
room
you
are
in
open
into
the
can
you
open
the
from
the
inside
yourself
yes
if
there
is
nobody
in
the
porter
s
go
and
see
if
there
is
any
one
there
and
be
careful
that
nobody
observes
then
i
waited
keeping
a
watch
on
the
door
and
window
in
six
or
seven
seconds
jeanne
reappeared
behind
the
bars
and
said
the
servant
is
in
the
porter
s
very
well
i
said
have
you
a
pen
and
ink
a
pencil
pass
it
out
i
took
an
old
newspaper
out
of
my
pocket
and
in
a
wind
which
blew
almost
hard
enough
to
put
the
out
in
a
downpour
of
snow
which
almost
blinded
me
i
managed
to
wrap
up
and
address
that
paper
to
mademoiselle
prefere
while
i
was
writing
i
asked
jeanne
when
the
postman
passes
he
puts
the
papers
and
letters
in
the
box
doesn
t
he
he
rings
the
bell
and
goes
away
then
the
servant
opens
the
and
takes
whatever
she
finds
there
to
mademoiselle
prefere
immediately
is
not
that
about
the
way
the
thing
is
managed
whenever
anything
comes
by
post
jeanne
thought
it
was
then
we
shall
soon
see
jeanne
go
and
watch
again
and
as
soon
as
the
servant
leaves
the
lodge
open
the
door
and
come
out
here
to
having
said
this
i
put
my
newspaper
in
the
box
gave
the
bell
a
tremendous
pull
and
then
hid
myself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
neighbouring
door
i
might
have
been
there
several
minutes
when
the
little
door
quivered
then
opened
and
a
young
girl
s
head
made
its
appearance
through
the
opening
i
took
hold
of
it
i
pulled
it
towards
me
come
jeanne
come
she
stared
at
me
uneasily
certainly
she
must
have
been
afraid
that
i
had
gone
mad
but
on
the
contrary
i
was
very
rational
indeed
come
my
child
come
where
to
madame
de
gabry
then
she
took
my
arm
for
some
time
we
ran
like
a
couple
of
thieves
but
running
is
an
exercise
to
one
as
corpulent
as
i
am
and
finding
myself
out
of
breath
at
last
i
stopped
and
leaned
upon
something
which
turned
out
to
be
the
stove
of
a
dealer
in
roasted
chestnuts
who
was
doing
business
at
the
corner
of
a
s
shop
where
a
number
of
cabmen
were
drinking
one
of
them
asked
us
if
we
did
not
want
a
cab
most
assuredly
we
wanted
a
cab
the
driver
after
setting
down
his
glass
on
the
zinc
counter
climbed
upon
his
seat
and
urged
his
horse
forward
we
were
saved
phew
i
panted
wiping
my
forehead
for
in
spite
of
the
cold
i
was
perspiring
profusely
what
seemed
very
odd
was
that
jeanne
appeared
to
be
much
more
conscious
than
i
was
of
the
enormity
which
we
had
committed
she
looked
very
serious
indeed
and
was
visibly
uneasy
in
the
kitchen
i
cried
out
with
indignation
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
say
well
there
or
anywhere
else
what
does
it
matter
to
me
and
by
the
light
of
the
i
observed
with
pain
that
her
face
was
very
thin
and
her
features
all
pinched
i
did
not
find
in
her
any
of
that
vivacity
any
of
those
bright
impulses
any
of
that
quickness
of
expression
which
used
to
please
me
so
much
her
gaze
had
become
timid
her
gestures
constrained
her
whole
attitude
melancholy
i
took
her
hand
a
little
cold
hand
which
had
become
all
hardened
and
bruised
the
poor
child
must
have
suffered
very
much
i
questioned
her
she
told
me
very
quietly
that
mademoiselle
prefere
had
summoned
her
one
day
and
called
her
a
little
monster
and
a
little
viper
for
some
reason
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
learn
she
had
added
you
shall
not
see
monsieur
bonnard
any
more
for
he
has
been
giving
you
bad
advice
and
he
has
conducted
himself
in
a
most
shameful
manner
towards
i
then
said
to
her
that
mademoiselle
you
will
never
be
able
to
make
me
then
mademoiselle
slapped
my
face
and
sent
me
back
to
the
the
announcement
that
i
should
never
be
allowed
to
see
you
again
made
me
feel
as
if
night
had
come
down
upon
me
don
t
you
know
those
evenings
when
one
feels
so
sad
to
see
the
darkness
come
well
just
imagine
such
a
moment
stretched
out
into
weeks
into
whole
months
don
t
you
remember
my
little
up
to
that
time
i
had
worked
at
it
as
well
as
i
could
just
simply
to
work
at
it
just
to
amuse
myself
but
when
i
lost
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
you
again
i
took
my
little
wax
figure
and
i
began
to
work
at
it
in
quite
another
way
i
did
not
try
to
model
it
with
wooden
matches
any
more
as
i
had
been
doing
but
with
hair
pins
i
even
made
use
of
epingles
a
la
neige
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
what
epingles
a
la
neige
are
well
i
became
more
particular
about
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
i
put
a
dragon
on
s
helmet
and
i
passed
hours
and
hours
in
making
a
head
and
eyes
and
tail
for
the
dragon
oh
the
eyes
the
eyes
above
all
i
never
stopped
working
at
them
till
i
got
them
so
that
they
had
red
pupils
and
white
and
and
everything
i
know
i
am
very
silly
i
had
an
idea
that
i
was
going
to
die
as
soon
as
my
little
would
be
finished
i
worked
at
it
during
and
mademoiselle
prefere
used
to
let
me
alone
one
day
i
learned
that
you
were
in
the
parlour
with
the
schoolmistress
i
watched
for
you
we
said
au
revoir
that
day
to
each
other
i
was
a
little
consoled
by
seeing
you
but
some
time
after
that
my
guardian
came
and
wanted
to
make
me
go
to
his
house
but
please
don
t
ask
me
why
monsieur
he
answered
me
quite
gently
that
i
was
a
very
whimsical
little
girl
and
then
he
left
me
alone
but
the
next
day
mademoiselle
prefere
came
to
me
with
such
a
wicked
look
on
her
face
that
i
was
really
afraid
she
had
a
letter
in
her
hand
mademoiselle
she
said
to
me
i
am
informed
by
your
guardian
that
he
has
spent
all
the
money
which
belonged
to
you
don
t
be
afraid
i
do
not
intend
to
abandon
you
but
you
must
acknowledge
yourself
it
is
only
right
that
you
should
earn
your
own
then
she
put
me
to
work
and
whenever
i
made
a
mistake
she
would
lock
me
up
in
the
garet
for
days
together
and
that
is
what
has
happened
to
me
since
i
saw
you
last
even
if
i
had
been
able
to
write
to
you
i
do
not
know
whether
i
should
have
done
it
because
i
did
not
think
you
could
possibly
take
me
away
from
the
school
and
as
maitre
mouche
did
not
come
back
to
see
me
there
was
no
hurry
i
thought
i
could
wait
for
awhile
in
the
garret
and
the
kitchen
jeanne
i
cried
even
if
we
should
have
to
flee
to
oceania
the
abominable
prefere
shall
never
get
hold
of
you
again
i
will
take
a
great
oath
on
that
and
why
should
we
not
go
to
oceania
the
climate
is
very
healthy
and
i
read
in
a
newspaper
the
other
day
that
they
have
pianos
there
but
in
the
meantime
let
us
go
to
the
house
of
madame
de
gabry
who
returned
to
paris
as
luck
would
have
it
some
three
or
four
days
ago
for
you
and
i
are
two
innocent
fools
and
we
have
great
need
of
some
one
to
help
even
as
i
was
speaking
jeanne
s
features
suddenly
became
pale
and
seemed
to
shrink
into
lifelessness
her
eyes
became
all
dim
her
lips
half
open
contracted
with
an
expression
of
pain
then
her
head
sank
sideways
on
her
shoulder
she
had
fainted
i
lifter
her
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
up
madame
de
gabry
s
staircase
like
a
little
baby
asleep
but
i
was
myself
on
the
point
of
fainting
from
emotional
excitement
and
fatigue
together
when
she
came
to
herself
again
ah
it
is
she
said
so
much
the
better
such
was
our
condition
when
we
rang
our
friend
s
same
day
it
was
eight
o
clock
madame
de
gabry
as
might
be
supposed
was
very
much
surprised
by
our
unexpected
appearance
but
she
welcomed
the
old
man
and
the
child
with
that
glad
kindness
which
always
expresses
itself
in
her
beautiful
gestures
it
seems
to
me
if
i
might
use
the
language
of
devotion
so
familiar
to
her
it
seems
to
me
as
though
some
heavenly
grace
streams
from
her
hands
when
ever
she
opens
them
and
even
the
perfume
which
impregnates
her
robes
seems
to
inspire
the
sweet
calm
zeal
of
charity
and
good
works
surprised
she
certainly
was
but
she
asked
us
no
question
and
that
silence
seemed
to
me
admirable
madame
i
said
to
her
we
have
both
come
to
place
ourselves
under
your
protection
and
first
of
all
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
give
us
some
super
or
to
give
jeanne
some
at
least
for
a
moment
ago
in
the
carriage
she
fainted
from
weakness
as
for
myself
i
could
not
eat
a
bite
at
this
late
hour
without
passing
a
night
of
agony
in
consequence
i
hope
that
monsieur
de
gabry
is
oh
he
is
here
she
said
and
she
called
him
immediately
come
in
here
paul
come
and
see
monsieur
bonnard
and
mademoiselle
he
came
it
was
a
pleasure
for
me
to
see
his
frank
broad
face
and
to
press
his
strong
square
hand
then
we
went
all
four
of
us
into
the
and
while
some
cold
meat
was
being
cut
for
jeanne
which
she
never
touched
notwithstanding
i
related
our
adventure
paul
de
gabry
asked
me
permission
to
smoke
his
pipe
after
which
he
listened
to
me
in
silence
when
i
had
finished
my
recital
he
scratched
the
short
stiff
beard
upon
his
chin
and
uttered
a
tremendous
sacrebleu
but
seeing
jeanne
stare
at
each
of
us
in
turn
with
a
frightened
look
in
her
face
he
added
we
will
talk
about
this
matter
morning
come
into
my
study
for
a
moment
i
have
an
old
book
to
show
you
that
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
i
followed
him
into
his
study
where
the
steel
of
guns
and
hunting
knives
suspended
against
the
dark
hangings
glimmered
in
the
there
pulling
me
down
beside
him
upon
a
sofa
he
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
great
god
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
corruption
of
a
minor
abduction
kidnapping
you
have
got
yourself
into
a
nice
mess
you
have
simply
rendered
yourself
liable
to
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
five
nor
more
than
ten
mercy
on
us
i
cried
ten
years
imprisonment
for
having
saved
an
innocent
that
is
the
law
answered
monsieur
de
gabry
you
see
my
dear
monsieur
bonnard
i
happen
to
know
the
code
pretty
well
not
because
i
ever
studied
law
as
a
profession
but
because
as
mayor
of
lusance
i
was
obliged
to
teach
myself
something
about
it
in
order
to
be
able
to
give
information
to
my
subordinates
mouche
is
a
rascal
that
woman
prefere
is
a
vile
hussy
and
you
are
a
well
i
really
can
not
find
a
word
strong
enough
to
signify
what
you
are
after
opening
his
bookcase
where
stirrups
spurs
and
a
few
books
of
reference
were
indiscriminately
stowed
away
he
took
out
of
it
a
copy
of
the
code
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
crimes
and
misdemeanours
sequestration
of
persons
that
is
not
your
case
abduction
of
minors
here
we
are
article
whosever
shall
either
by
fraud
or
violence
have
abducted
or
have
caused
to
be
abducted
any
minor
or
minors
or
shall
have
enticed
them
or
turned
them
away
from
or
forcibly
removed
them
or
shall
have
caused
them
to
be
enticed
or
turned
away
from
or
forcibly
removed
from
the
places
in
which
they
have
been
placed
by
those
to
whose
authority
or
direction
they
have
been
submitted
or
confided
shall
be
liable
to
the
penalty
of
imprisonment
see
penal
code
and
here
is
the
term
of
imprisonment
shall
not
be
less
than
five
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
shall
be
considered
as
involving
a
loss
of
civil
now
all
that
is
very
plain
is
it
not
monsieur
bonnard
perfectly
now
let
us
go
on
article
in
case
the
abductor
be
under
the
age
of
years
at
the
time
of
the
offense
he
shall
only
be
punished
with
but
we
certainly
can
not
invoke
this
article
in
your
favour
article
in
case
the
abductor
shall
have
married
the
girl
by
him
abducted
he
can
only
be
prosecuted
at
the
insistence
of
such
persons
as
according
to
the
civil
code
may
have
the
right
to
demand
that
the
marriage
shall
be
declared
null
nor
can
he
be
condemned
until
after
the
nullity
of
the
marriage
shall
have
been
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
a
part
of
your
plans
to
marry
mademoiselle
alexandre
you
can
see
that
the
code
is
about
it
it
leaves
you
one
door
of
escape
but
no
i
ought
not
to
joke
with
you
because
really
you
have
put
yourself
in
a
very
unfortunate
position
and
how
could
a
man
like
you
imagine
that
here
in
paris
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
young
girl
can
be
abducted
with
absolute
impunity
we
are
not
living
in
the
middle
ages
now
and
such
things
are
no
longer
permitted
by
you
need
not
imagine
i
replied
that
abduction
was
lawful
under
the
ancient
code
you
will
find
in
baluze
a
decree
issued
by
king
cheldebert
at
cologne
either
in
or
on
the
subject
moreover
everybody
knows
that
the
famous
ordonance
de
blois
of
may
formally
enacted
that
any
persons
convicted
of
having
suborned
any
son
or
daughter
under
the
age
of
years
whether
under
promise
of
marriage
or
otherwise
without
the
full
knowledge
will
or
consent
of
the
father
mother
and
guardians
should
be
punished
with
death
and
the
ordinance
adds
et
pareillement
seront
punis
extraordinairement
tous
ceux
qui
auront
participe
audit
rapt
et
qui
auront
prete
conseil
confort
et
aide
en
aucune
maniere
que
ce
and
in
like
manner
shall
be
extraordinarily
punished
all
persons
whomsoever
who
shall
have
participated
in
the
said
abduction
and
who
shall
have
given
thereunto
counsel
succor
or
aid
in
any
manner
whatsoever
those
are
the
exact
or
very
nearly
the
exact
terms
of
the
ordinance
as
for
that
article
of
the
which
you
have
just
told
me
of
and
which
excepts
from
liability
to
prosecution
the
abductor
who
marries
the
young
girl
abducted
by
him
it
reminds
me
that
according
to
the
laws
of
bretagne
forcible
abduction
followed
by
marriage
was
not
punished
but
this
usage
which
involved
various
abuses
was
suppressed
in
at
least
i
give
you
the
date
within
ten
years
my
memory
is
not
very
good
now
and
the
time
is
long
passed
when
i
could
repeat
by
heart
without
even
stopping
to
take
breath
fifteen
hundred
verses
of
girart
de
rousillon
as
far
as
regards
the
capitulary
of
charlemagne
which
fixes
the
compensation
for
abduction
i
have
not
mentioned
it
because
i
am
sure
that
you
must
remember
it
so
my
dear
monsieur
de
gabry
you
see
abduction
was
considered
as
decidedly
a
punishable
offense
under
the
three
dynasties
of
old
france
it
is
a
very
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
middle
ages
represent
a
period
of
social
chaos
you
must
remember
on
the
contrary
monsieur
de
gabry
here
interrupted
me
so
he
exclaimed
you
know
of
the
ordonnacne
de
blois
you
know
baluze
you
know
childebert
you
know
the
capitularies
and
you
don
t
know
anything
about
the
i
replied
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
never
had
read
the
code
and
he
looked
very
much
surprised
and
now
do
you
understand
he
asked
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
action
you
have
committed
i
had
not
indeed
been
yet
able
to
understand
it
fully
but
little
by
little
with
the
aid
of
monsieur
paul
s
very
sensible
explanations
i
reached
the
conviction
at
last
that
i
should
not
be
judged
in
regard
to
my
motives
which
were
innocent
but
only
according
to
my
action
which
was
punishable
thereupon
i
began
to
feel
very
despondent
and
to
utter
divers
lamentations
what
am
i
to
do
i
cried
out
what
am
i
to
do
am
i
then
irretrievably
ruined
and
have
i
also
ruined
the
poor
child
whom
i
wanted
to
save
monsieur
de
gabry
silently
filled
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
so
slowly
that
his
kind
broad
face
remained
for
at
least
three
or
four
minutes
glowing
red
behind
the
light
like
a
blacksmith
s
in
the
gleam
of
his
then
he
said
you
want
to
know
what
to
do
why
don
t
do
anything
my
dear
monsieur
bonnard
for
god
s
sake
and
for
your
own
sake
don
t
do
anything
at
all
your
situation
is
bad
enough
as
it
is
don
t
try
to
meddle
with
it
now
unless
you
want
to
create
new
difficulties
for
yourself
but
you
must
promise
me
to
sustain
me
in
any
action
that
i
may
take
i
shall
go
to
see
monsieur
mouche
the
very
first
thing
morning
and
if
he
turns
out
to
be
what
i
think
he
is
that
is
to
say
a
consummate
rascal
i
shall
very
soon
find
means
of
making
him
harmless
even
if
the
devil
himself
should
take
sides
with
him
for
everything
depends
on
him
as
it
is
too
late
this
evening
to
take
mademoiselle
jeanne
back
to
her
my
wife
will
keep
the
young
lady
here
this
of
course
plainly
constitues
the
misdemeanour
of
complicity
but
it
saves
the
girl
from
anything
like
an
equivocal
position
as
for
you
my
dear
monsieur
you
just
go
back
to
the
quai
malaquais
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
if
they
come
to
look
for
jeanne
there
it
will
be
very
easy
for
you
to
prove
she
is
not
in
your
while
we
were
thus
talking
madame
de
gabry
was
preparing
to
make
her
young
lodger
comfortable
for
the
night
when
she
bade
me
at
the
door
she
was
carrying
a
pair
of
clean
sheets
scented
with
lavender
thrown
over
her
arm
that
i
said
is
a
sweet
honest
well
of
course
answered
madame
de
gabry
you
must
remember
we
are
ah
i
answered
her
heaven
grant
that
i
also
may
be
able
one
of
these
days
to
become
a
peasant
heaven
grant
that
one
of
these
days
i
may
be
able
as
you
are
at
lusance
to
inhale
the
sweet
fresh
odour
of
the
country
and
live
in
some
little
house
all
hidden
among
trees
and
if
this
wish
of
mine
be
too
ambitious
on
the
part
of
an
old
man
whose
life
is
nearly
closed
then
i
will
only
wish
that
my
may
be
as
sweetly
scented
with
lavender
as
that
linen
you
have
on
your
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
come
to
lunch
the
following
morning
but
i
was
positively
forbidden
to
show
myself
at
the
house
before
midday
jeanne
as
she
kissed
me
begged
me
not
to
take
her
back
to
the
school
any
more
we
felt
much
affected
at
parting
and
very
anxious
i
found
therese
waiting
for
me
on
the
landing
in
such
a
condition
of
worry
about
me
that
it
had
made
her
furious
she
talked
of
nothing
less
than
keeping
me
under
lock
and
key
in
the
future
what
a
night
i
passed
i
never
closed
my
eyes
for
one
single
instant
from
time
to
time
i
could
not
help
laughing
like
a
boy
at
the
success
of
my
prank
and
then
again
an
inexpressible
feeling
of
horror
would
come
upon
me
at
the
thought
of
being
dragged
before
some
magistrate
and
having
to
take
my
place
upon
the
prisoner
s
bench
to
answer
for
the
crime
which
i
had
so
naturally
committed
i
was
very
much
afraid
and
nevertheless
i
felt
no
remorse
or
regret
whatever
the
sun
coming
into
my
room
at
last
merrily
lighted
upon
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
then
i
made
this
prayer
my
god
thou
who
didst
make
the
sky
and
the
dew
as
it
is
said
in
tristan
judge
me
in
thine
equity
not
indeed
according
unto
my
acts
but
according
only
to
my
motives
which
thou
knowest
have
been
upright
and
pure
and
i
will
say
glory
to
thee
in
heaven
and
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
i
give
into
thy
hands
the
child
i
stole
away
do
that
for
her
which
i
have
not
known
how
to
do
guard
for
her
from
all
her
enemies
and
blessed
for
ever
be
thy
name
december
when
i
arrived
at
madame
de
gabry
s
i
found
jeanne
completely
transfigured
had
she
also
like
myself
at
the
very
first
light
of
dawn
called
upon
him
who
made
the
sky
and
the
dew
she
smiled
with
such
a
sweet
calm
smile
madame
de
gabry
called
her
away
to
arrange
her
hair
for
the
amiable
lady
had
insisted
upon
combing
and
plaiting
with
her
own
hands
the
hair
of
the
child
confided
to
her
care
as
i
had
come
a
little
before
the
hour
agreed
upon
i
had
interrupted
this
charming
toilet
by
way
of
punishment
i
was
told
to
go
and
wait
in
the
parlour
all
by
myself
monsieur
de
gabry
joined
me
there
in
a
little
while
he
had
evidently
just
come
in
for
i
could
see
on
his
forehead
the
mark
left
my
the
lining
of
his
hat
his
frank
face
wore
an
expression
of
joyful
excitement
i
thought
i
had
better
not
ask
him
any
questions
and
we
all
went
to
lunch
when
the
servants
had
finished
waiting
at
table
monsieur
paul
who
had
been
keeping
his
good
story
for
the
dessert
said
to
us
well
i
went
to
did
you
see
maitre
mouche
excitedly
inquired
madame
de
gabry
no
he
replied
curiously
watching
the
expression
of
disappointment
upon
our
faces
after
having
amused
himself
with
our
anxiety
for
a
reasonable
time
the
good
fellow
added
maitre
mouche
is
no
longer
at
levallois
maitre
mouche
has
gone
away
from
france
the
day
after
will
make
just
eight
days
since
he
decamped
taking
with
him
all
the
money
of
his
clients
a
tolerably
large
sum
i
found
the
office
closed
a
woman
who
lived
close
by
told
me
all
about
it
with
an
abundance
of
curses
and
imprecations
the
notary
did
not
take
the
train
all
by
himself
he
took
with
him
the
daughter
of
the
hairdresser
of
levallois
a
young
person
quite
famous
in
that
part
of
the
country
for
her
beauty
and
her
accomplishments
they
say
she
could
shave
better
than
her
father
well
anyhow
mouche
has
run
away
with
her
the
commissaire
de
police
confirmed
the
fact
for
me
now
really
could
it
have
been
possible
for
maitre
mouche
to
have
left
the
country
at
a
more
opportune
moment
if
he
had
only
deferred
his
escapade
one
week
longer
he
would
have
been
still
the
representative
of
society
and
would
have
had
you
dragged
off
to
gaol
monsieur
bonnard
like
a
criminal
at
present
we
have
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
him
here
is
to
the
health
of
maitre
mouche
he
cried
pouring
out
a
glass
of
white
wine
i
would
like
to
live
a
long
time
if
it
were
only
to
remember
that
delightful
morning
we
four
were
all
assembled
in
the
big
white
around
the
waxed
oak
table
monsieur
paul
s
mirth
was
of
the
hearty
kind
even
perhaps
a
little
riotous
and
the
good
man
quaffed
deeply
madame
de
gabry
smiled
at
me
with
a
smile
so
sweet
so
perfect
and
so
noble
that
i
thought
such
a
woman
ought
to
keep
smiles
like
that
simply
as
a
reward
for
good
actions
and
thus
make
everybody
who
knew
her
do
all
the
good
of
which
they
were
capable
then
to
reward
us
for
our
pains
jeanne
who
had
regained
something
of
her
former
vivacity
asked
us
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
one
dozen
questions
to
answer
which
would
have
required
an
exhaustive
exposition
on
the
nature
of
man
the
nature
of
the
universe
the
science
of
physics
and
of
metaphysics
the
macrocosm
and
the
microcosm
not
to
speak
of
the
ineffable
and
the
unknowable
then
she
drew
out
of
her
pocket
her
little
who
had
suffered
most
cruelly
during
our
flight
his
legs
and
arms
were
gone
but
he
still
had
his
gold
helmet
with
the
green
dragon
on
it
jeanne
solemnly
pledged
herself
to
make
a
restoration
of
him
in
honour
of
madame
de
gabry
delightful
friends
i
left
them
at
last
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
joy
on
my
lodgings
i
had
to
endure
the
very
sharpest
remonstrances
from
therese
who
said
she
had
given
up
trying
to
understand
my
new
way
of
living
in
her
opinion
monsieur
had
really
lost
his
mind
yes
therese
i
am
a
mad
old
man
and
you
are
a
mad
old
woman
that
is
certain
may
the
good
god
bless
us
both
therese
and
give
us
new
strength
for
we
now
have
new
duties
to
perform
but
let
me
lie
down
upon
the
sofa
for
i
really
can
not
keep
myself
on
my
feet
any
january
monsieur
said
jeanne
letting
herself
in
while
therese
remained
grumbling
in
the
corridor
because
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
to
the
door
in
time
mademoiselle
i
beg
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
address
me
very
solemnly
by
my
title
and
to
say
to
me
my
then
it
has
all
been
settled
oh
how
nice
cried
the
child
clapping
her
hands
it
has
all
been
arranged
mademoiselle
in
the
and
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
from
you
are
under
my
authority
what
are
you
laughing
about
my
ward
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
you
have
some
crazy
idea
in
your
head
this
very
moment
some
more
nonsense
eh
oh
no
monsieur
i
mean
my
guardian
i
was
looking
at
your
white
hair
it
curls
out
from
under
the
edge
of
your
hat
like
honeysuckle
on
a
balcony
it
is
very
handsome
and
i
like
it
very
much
be
good
enough
to
sit
down
my
ward
and
if
you
can
possibly
help
it
stop
saying
ridiculous
things
because
i
have
some
very
serious
things
to
say
to
you
listen
i
suppose
you
are
not
going
to
insist
upon
being
sent
back
to
the
establishment
of
mademoiselle
prefere
no
well
then
what
would
you
say
if
i
should
take
you
here
to
live
with
me
and
to
finish
your
education
and
keep
you
here
until
what
shall
i
say
for
ever
as
the
song
has
it
oh
monsieur
she
cried
flushing
crimson
with
pleasure
i
continued
behind
there
we
have
a
nice
little
room
which
my
housekeeper
has
cleaned
up
and
furnished
for
you
you
are
going
to
take
the
place
of
the
books
which
used
to
be
in
it
you
will
succeed
them
as
the
day
succeeds
night
go
with
therese
and
look
at
it
and
see
if
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
live
in
it
madame
de
gabry
and
i
have
made
up
our
minds
that
you
can
sleep
there
she
had
already
started
to
run
i
called
her
back
for
a
moment
jeanne
listen
to
me
a
moment
longer
you
have
always
until
now
made
yourself
a
favourite
with
my
housekeeper
who
like
all
very
old
people
is
apt
to
be
cross
at
times
be
gentle
and
forebearing
make
every
allowance
for
her
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
make
every
allowance
for
her
myself
and
to
put
up
with
all
her
fits
of
impatience
now
let
me
tell
you
jeanne
respect
her
and
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
forget
that
she
is
my
servant
and
yours
neither
will
she
ever
allow
herself
to
forget
it
for
a
moment
but
what
i
want
you
to
respect
in
her
is
her
great
age
and
her
great
heart
she
is
a
humble
woman
who
has
lived
a
very
very
long
time
in
the
habit
of
doing
good
and
she
has
become
hardened
and
stiffened
in
that
habit
bear
patiently
with
the
harsh
ways
of
that
upright
soul
if
you
know
how
to
command
she
will
know
how
to
obey
go
now
my
child
arrange
your
room
in
whatever
way
may
seem
to
you
best
suited
for
your
studies
and
for
your
having
started
jeanne
with
this
viaticum
upon
her
domestic
career
i
began
to
read
a
review
which
although
conducted
by
very
young
men
is
excellent
the
tone
of
it
is
somewhat
unpolished
but
the
spirit
is
zealous
the
article
i
read
was
certainly
far
superior
in
point
of
precision
and
positiveness
to
anything
of
the
sort
ever
written
when
i
was
a
young
man
the
author
of
the
article
monsieur
paul
meyer
points
out
every
error
with
a
remarkably
lucid
power
of
incisive
criticism
we
used
not
in
my
time
to
criticise
with
such
strict
justice
our
indulgence
was
vast
it
went
even
so
far
as
to
confuse
the
scholar
and
the
ignoramus
in
the
same
burst
of
praise
and
nevertheless
one
must
learn
how
to
find
fault
and
it
is
even
an
imperative
duty
to
blame
when
the
blame
is
deserved
i
remember
little
raymond
that
was
the
name
we
gave
him
he
did
not
know
anything
and
his
mind
was
not
a
mind
capable
of
absorbing
any
solid
learning
but
he
was
very
fond
of
his
mother
we
took
very
good
care
never
to
utter
a
hint
of
the
ignorance
of
so
perfect
a
son
and
thanks
to
our
forbearance
little
raymond
made
his
way
to
the
highest
positions
he
had
lost
his
mother
then
but
honours
of
all
kinds
were
showered
upon
him
he
became
omnipotent
to
the
grievous
injury
of
his
colleagues
and
of
science
but
here
comes
my
young
fiend
of
the
luxembourg
gelis
you
look
very
happy
what
good
fortune
has
come
to
you
my
dear
lad
his
good
fortune
is
that
he
has
been
able
to
sustain
his
thesis
very
credibly
and
that
he
has
taken
high
rank
in
his
class
he
tells
me
this
with
the
additional
information
that
my
own
words
which
were
incidentally
referred
to
in
the
course
of
the
examination
had
been
spoken
of
by
the
college
professors
in
terms
of
the
most
unqualified
praise
that
is
very
nice
i
replied
and
it
makes
me
very
happy
gelis
to
find
my
old
reputation
thus
associated
with
your
own
youthful
honours
i
was
very
much
interested
you
know
in
that
thesis
of
yours
but
some
domestic
arrangements
have
been
keeping
me
so
busy
lately
that
i
quite
forgot
this
was
the
day
on
which
you
were
to
sustain
mademoiselle
jeanne
made
her
appearance
very
opportunely
as
if
in
order
to
suggest
to
him
something
about
the
nature
of
those
very
domestic
arrangements
the
giddy
girl
burst
into
the
city
of
books
like
a
fresh
breeze
crying
at
the
top
of
her
voice
that
her
room
was
a
perfect
little
wonder
then
she
became
very
red
indeed
on
seeing
monsieur
gelis
there
but
none
of
us
can
escape
our
destiny
monsieur
gelis
asked
her
how
she
was
with
the
tone
of
a
young
fellow
who
resumes
upon
a
previous
acquaintance
and
who
proposes
to
put
himself
forward
as
an
old
friend
oh
never
fear
she
had
not
forgotten
him
at
all
that
was
very
evident
from
the
fact
that
then
and
there
right
under
my
nose
they
resumed
their
last
year
s
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
venetian
blond
they
continued
the
discussion
after
quite
an
animated
fashion
i
began
to
ask
myself
what
right
i
had
to
be
in
the
room
at
all
the
only
thing
i
could
do
in
order
to
make
myself
heard
was
to
cough
as
for
getting
in
a
word
they
never
even
gave
me
a
chance
gelis
discoursed
enthusiastically
not
only
about
the
venetian
colourists
but
also
upon
all
other
matters
relating
to
nature
or
to
mankind
and
jeanne
kept
answering
him
yes
monsieur
you
are
that
is
just
what
i
supposed
monsieur
you
express
so
beautifully
just
what
i
i
am
going
to
think
a
great
deal
about
what
you
have
just
told
me
when
i
speak
mademoiselle
never
answers
me
in
that
tone
it
is
only
with
the
very
tip
of
her
tongue
that
she
will
even
taste
any
intellectual
food
which
i
set
before
her
usually
she
will
not
touch
it
at
all
but
monsieur
gelis
seems
to
be
in
her
opinion
the
supreme
authority
upon
all
subjects
it
was
always
oh
yes
oh
of
course
to
all
his
empty
chatter
and
then
the
eyes
of
jeanne
i
had
never
seen
them
look
so
large
before
i
had
never
before
observed
in
them
such
fixity
of
expression
but
her
gaze
otherwise
remained
what
it
always
is
artless
frank
and
brave
gelis
evidently
pleased
her
she
like
gelis
and
her
eyes
betrayed
the
fact
they
would
have
published
it
to
the
entire
universe
all
very
fine
master
bonnard
you
have
been
so
deeply
interested
in
observing
your
ward
that
you
have
been
forgetting
you
are
her
guardian
you
began
only
this
morning
to
exercise
that
function
and
you
can
already
see
that
it
involves
some
very
delicate
and
difficult
duties
bonnard
you
must
really
try
to
devise
some
means
of
keeping
that
young
man
away
from
her
you
really
ought
eh
how
am
i
to
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
have
picked
up
a
book
at
random
from
the
nearest
shelf
i
open
it
and
i
enter
respectfully
into
the
middle
of
a
drama
of
sophocles
the
older
i
grow
the
more
i
learn
to
love
the
two
civilisations
of
the
antique
world
and
now
i
always
keep
the
poets
of
italy
and
of
greece
on
a
shelf
within
easy
reach
of
my
arm
in
the
city
of
books
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
finally
condescend
to
take
some
notice
of
me
now
that
i
seem
too
busy
to
take
any
notice
of
them
i
really
think
that
mademoiselle
jeanne
has
even
asked
me
what
i
am
reading
no
indeed
i
will
not
tell
her
what
it
is
what
i
am
reading
between
ourselves
is
the
change
of
that
smooth
and
luminous
chorus
which
rolls
out
its
magnificent
tunefulness
through
a
scene
of
passionate
violence
the
chorus
of
the
old
men
of
thebes
erws
avixate
invincible
love
o
thou
who
descendest
upon
rich
houses
thou
who
dost
rest
upon
the
delicate
cheek
of
the
maiden
thou
who
dost
traverse
all
seas
surely
none
among
the
immortals
can
escape
thee
nor
indeed
any
among
men
who
live
but
for
a
little
space
and
he
who
is
possessed
by
thee
there
is
a
madness
upon
and
when
i
had
that
delicious
chant
the
face
of
antigone
appeared
before
me
in
all
its
passionless
purity
what
images
gods
and
goddesses
who
hover
in
the
highest
heights
of
heaven
the
blind
old
man
the
led
by
antigone
has
now
been
buried
with
holy
rites
and
his
daughter
fair
as
the
fairest
dream
ever
conceived
by
human
soul
resists
the
will
of
the
tyrant
and
gives
pious
sepulture
to
her
brother
she
loves
the
son
of
the
tyrant
and
that
son
loves
her
also
and
as
she
goes
on
her
way
to
execution
the
victim
of
her
own
sweet
piety
the
old
men
sing
invincible
love
o
thou
who
dost
descend
upon
rich
houses
thou
who
dost
rest
upon
the
delicate
cheek
of
the
mademoiselle
jeanne
are
you
really
very
anxious
to
know
what
i
am
reading
i
am
reading
mademoiselle
i
am
reading
that
antigone
having
buried
the
blind
old
man
wove
a
fair
tapestry
embroidered
with
images
in
the
likeness
of
laughing
ah
said
gelis
as
he
burs
out
laughing
that
is
not
in
the
it
is
a
scholium
i
said
unpublished
he
added
getting
up
i
am
not
an
egotist
but
i
am
prudent
i
have
to
bring
up
this
child
she
is
much
too
young
to
be
married
now
no
i
am
not
an
egotist
but
i
must
certainly
keep
her
with
me
for
a
few
years
more
keep
her
alone
with
me
she
can
surely
wait
until
i
am
dead
fear
not
antigone
old
oedipus
will
find
holy
burial
soon
enough
in
the
meanwhile
antigone
is
helping
our
housekeeper
to
scrape
the
carrots
she
says
she
like
to
do
it
that
it
is
in
her
line
being
related
to
the
art
of
sculpture
may
who
would
recognise
the
city
of
books
now
there
are
flowers
everywhere
even
upon
all
the
articles
of
furniture
jeanne
was
right
those
roses
do
look
very
nice
in
that
blue
china
vase
she
goes
to
market
every
day
with
therese
under
the
pretext
of
helping
the
old
servant
to
make
her
purchases
but
she
never
brings
anything
back
with
her
except
flowers
flowers
are
really
very
charming
creatures
and
one
of
these
days
i
must
certainly
carry
out
my
plan
and
devote
myself
to
the
study
of
them
in
their
own
natural
domain
in
the
country
with
all
the
science
and
earnestness
which
i
possess
for
what
have
i
to
do
here
why
should
i
burn
my
eyes
out
over
these
old
parchments
which
can
not
now
tell
me
anything
worth
knowing
i
used
to
study
them
these
old
texts
with
the
most
ardent
enjoyment
what
was
it
which
i
was
then
so
anxious
to
find
in
them
the
date
of
a
pious
foundation
the
name
of
some
monkish
imagier
or
copyist
the
price
of
a
loaf
of
an
ox
or
of
a
field
some
judicial
or
administrative
enactment
all
that
and
yet
something
more
a
something
vaguely
mysterious
and
sublime
which
excited
my
enthusiasm
but
for
sixty
years
i
have
been
searching
in
vain
for
that
something
better
men
than
i
the
masters
the
truly
great
the
fauriels
the
thierrys
who
found
so
many
things
died
at
their
task
without
having
been
able
any
more
than
i
have
been
to
find
that
something
which
being
incorporeal
has
no
name
and
without
which
nevertheless
no
great
mental
work
would
ever
be
undertaken
in
this
world
and
now
that
i
am
only
looking
for
what
i
should
certainly
be
able
to
find
i
can
not
find
anything
at
all
and
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
never
be
able
to
finish
the
history
of
the
abbots
of
guardian
just
guess
what
i
have
in
my
judging
from
appearances
jeanne
i
should
say
oh
no
not
flowers
look
i
look
and
i
see
a
little
grey
head
poking
itself
out
of
the
handkerchief
it
is
the
head
of
a
little
grey
cat
the
handkerchief
opens
the
animal
leaps
down
upon
the
carpet
shakes
itself
pricks
up
first
one
ear
and
then
the
other
and
begins
to
examine
with
due
caution
the
locality
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
therese
out
of
breath
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
suddenly
makes
her
appearance
in
time
to
take
an
objective
part
in
this
examination
which
does
not
appear
to
result
altogether
in
her
favour
for
the
young
cat
moves
slowly
away
from
her
without
however
venturing
near
my
legs
or
approaching
jeanne
who
displays
extraordinary
volubility
in
the
use
of
caressing
appellations
therese
whose
chief
fault
is
her
inability
to
hide
her
feelings
thereupon
vehemently
reproaches
mademoiselle
for
bringing
home
a
cat
that
she
did
not
know
anything
about
jeanne
in
order
to
justify
herself
tells
the
whole
story
while
she
was
passing
with
therese
before
a
chemist
s
shop
she
saw
the
assistant
kick
a
little
cat
into
the
street
the
cat
astonished
and
frightened
seemed
to
be
asking
itself
whether
to
remain
in
the
street
where
it
was
being
terrified
and
knocked
about
by
the
people
passing
by
or
whether
to
go
back
into
the
chemist
s
even
at
the
risk
of
being
kicked
out
a
second
time
jeanne
thought
it
was
in
a
very
critical
position
and
understood
its
hesitation
it
looked
so
stupid
and
she
knew
it
looked
stupid
only
because
it
could
not
decide
what
to
do
so
she
took
it
up
in
her
arms
and
as
it
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
any
rest
either
indoors
out
it
allowed
her
to
hold
it
then
she
stroked
and
petted
it
to
keep
it
from
being
afraid
and
boldly
went
to
the
chemist
s
assistant
and
said
if
you
don
t
like
that
animal
you
mustn
t
beat
it
you
must
give
it
to
take
it
said
the
assistant
now
there
adds
jeanne
by
way
of
conclusion
and
then
she
changes
her
voice
again
to
a
in
order
to
say
all
kinds
of
sweet
things
to
the
cat
he
is
horribly
thin
i
observe
looking
at
the
wretched
animal
moreover
he
is
horribly
jeanne
thinks
he
is
not
ugly
at
all
but
she
acknowledges
that
he
looks
even
more
stupid
than
he
looked
at
first
this
time
she
thinks
it
not
indecision
but
surprise
which
gives
that
unfortunate
aspect
to
his
countenance
she
asks
us
to
imagine
ourselves
in
his
place
then
we
are
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
he
can
not
possibly
understand
what
has
happened
to
him
and
then
we
all
burst
out
laughing
in
the
face
of
the
poor
little
beast
which
maintains
the
most
comical
look
of
gravity
jeanne
wants
to
take
him
up
but
he
hides
himself
under
the
table
and
can
not
even
be
tempted
to
come
out
by
the
lure
of
a
saucer
of
milk
we
all
turn
our
backs
and
promise
not
to
look
when
we
inspect
the
saucer
again
we
find
it
empty
jeanne
i
observe
your
protege
has
a
decidedly
tristful
aspect
of
countenance
he
is
of
sly
and
suspicious
disposition
i
trust
he
is
not
going
to
commit
in
the
city
of
books
any
such
misdemeanours
as
might
render
it
necessary
for
us
to
send
him
back
to
his
chemist
s
shop
in
the
meantime
we
must
give
him
a
name
suppose
we
call
him
don
gris
de
gouttiere
but
perhaps
that
is
too
long
pill
drug
or
would
be
short
enough
and
would
further
serve
to
recall
his
early
condition
in
life
what
do
you
think
about
it
pill
would
not
sound
bad
answers
jeanne
but
it
would
be
very
unkind
to
give
him
a
name
which
would
be
always
reminding
him
of
the
misery
from
which
we
saved
him
it
would
be
making
him
pay
too
dearly
for
our
hospitality
let
us
be
more
generous
and
give
him
a
pretty
name
in
hopes
that
he
is
going
to
deserve
it
see
how
he
looks
at
us
he
knows
that
we
are
talking
about
him
and
now
that
he
is
no
longer
unhappy
he
is
beginning
to
look
a
great
deal
less
stupid
i
am
not
joking
unhappiness
does
make
people
look
stupid
i
am
perfectly
sure
it
well
jeanne
if
you
like
we
will
call
your
protege
hannibal
the
appropriateness
of
that
name
does
not
seem
to
strike
you
at
once
but
the
angora
cat
who
preceded
him
here
as
an
intimate
of
the
city
of
books
and
to
whom
i
was
in
the
habit
of
telling
all
my
secrets
for
he
was
a
very
wise
and
discreet
person
used
to
be
called
hamilcar
it
is
natural
that
this
name
should
beget
the
other
and
that
hannibal
should
succeed
we
all
agreed
upon
this
point
hannibal
cried
jeanne
come
here
hannibal
greatly
frightened
by
the
strange
sonority
of
his
own
name
ran
to
hid
himself
under
a
bookcase
in
an
orifice
so
small
that
a
rat
could
not
have
squeezed
himself
into
it
a
nice
way
of
doing
credit
to
so
great
a
name
i
was
in
a
good
humour
for
working
that
day
and
i
had
just
dipped
the
nib
of
my
pen
into
the
when
i
heard
some
one
ring
should
any
one
ever
read
these
pages
written
by
an
unimaginative
old
man
he
will
be
sure
to
laugh
at
the
way
that
bell
keeps
ringing
through
my
narrative
without
ever
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
new
personage
or
introducing
any
unexpected
incident
on
the
stage
things
are
managed
on
the
reverse
principle
monsieur
scribe
never
has
the
curtain
raised
without
good
reason
and
for
the
greater
enjoyment
of
ladies
and
young
misses
that
is
art
i
would
rather
hang
myself
than
write
a
play
not
that
i
despise
life
but
because
i
should
never
be
able
to
invent
anything
amusing
invent
in
order
to
do
that
one
must
have
received
the
gift
of
inspiration
it
would
be
a
very
unfortunate
thing
for
me
to
possess
such
a
gift
suppose
i
were
to
invent
some
monkling
in
my
history
of
the
abbey
of
what
would
our
young
erudites
say
what
a
scandal
for
the
school
as
for
the
institute
it
would
say
nothing
and
probably
not
even
think
about
the
matter
either
even
if
my
colleagues
still
write
a
little
sometimes
they
never
read
they
are
of
the
opinion
of
parny
who
said
une
paisible
indifference
est
la
plus
sage
des
the
most
wise
of
the
virtues
is
a
calm
to
be
the
least
wise
in
order
to
become
the
most
wise
this
is
precisely
what
those
buddhists
are
aiming
at
without
knowing
it
if
there
is
any
wiser
wisdom
than
that
i
will
go
to
rome
to
report
upon
it
and
all
this
because
monsieur
gelis
happened
to
ring
the
bell
this
young
man
has
latterly
changed
his
manner
completely
with
jeanne
he
is
now
quite
as
serious
as
he
used
to
be
frivolous
and
quite
as
silent
as
he
used
to
be
chatty
and
jeanne
follows
his
example
we
have
reached
the
phase
of
passionate
love
under
constraint
for
old
as
i
am
i
can
not
be
deceived
about
it
these
two
children
are
violently
and
sincerely
in
love
with
each
other
jeanne
now
avoids
him
she
hides
herself
in
her
room
when
he
comes
into
the
library
but
how
well
she
knows
how
to
reach
him
when
she
is
alone
alone
at
her
piano
every
evening
she
talks
to
him
through
the
music
she
plays
with
a
rich
thrill
of
passional
feeling
which
is
the
new
utterance
of
her
new
soul
well
why
should
i
not
confess
it
why
should
i
not
avow
my
weakness
surely
my
egotism
would
not
become
any
less
blameworthy
by
keeping
it
hidden
from
myself
so
i
will
write
it
yes
i
was
hoping
for
something
else
yes
i
thought
i
was
going
to
keep
her
all
to
myself
as
my
own
child
as
my
own
daughter
not
always
of
course
not
even
perhaps
for
very
long
but
just
for
a
few
short
years
more
i
am
so
old
could
she
not
wait
and
who
knows
with
the
help
of
the
gout
i
would
not
have
imposed
upon
her
patience
too
much
that
was
my
wish
that
was
my
hope
i
had
made
my
plans
i
had
not
reckoned
upon
the
coming
of
this
wild
young
man
but
the
mistake
is
none
the
less
cruel
because
my
reckoning
happened
to
be
wrong
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
condemning
yourself
very
rashly
friend
sylvestre
bonnard
if
you
did
want
to
keep
this
young
girl
a
few
years
longer
it
was
quite
as
much
in
her
own
interest
as
in
yours
she
has
a
great
deal
to
learn
yet
and
you
are
not
a
master
to
be
despised
when
that
miserable
notary
mouche
who
subsequently
committed
his
rascalities
at
so
opportune
a
moment
paid
you
the
honour
of
a
visit
you
explained
to
him
your
ideas
of
education
with
all
the
fervour
of
high
enthusiasm
then
you
attempted
to
put
that
system
of
yours
into
practice
jeanne
is
certainly
an
ungrateful
girl
and
gelis
a
much
too
seductive
young
man
but
still
unless
i
put
him
out
of
the
house
which
would
be
a
detestably
and
thing
to
do
i
must
continue
to
receive
him
he
has
been
waiting
ever
so
long
in
my
little
parlour
in
front
of
those
sevres
vases
with
which
king
louis
philippe
so
graciously
presented
me
the
moissonneurs
and
the
pecheurs
of
leopold
robert
are
painted
upon
those
porcelain
vases
which
gelis
nevertheless
dares
to
call
frightfully
ugly
with
the
warm
approval
of
jeanne
whom
he
has
absolutely
bewitched
my
dear
lad
excuse
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
so
long
i
had
a
little
bit
of
work
to
i
am
telling
the
truth
meditation
is
work
but
of
course
gelis
does
not
know
what
i
mean
he
thinks
i
am
referring
to
something
archaeological
and
his
question
in
regard
to
the
health
of
mademoiselle
jeanne
having
been
answered
by
a
very
well
indeed
uttered
in
that
extremely
dry
tone
which
reveals
my
moral
authority
as
guardian
we
begin
to
converse
about
historical
subjects
we
first
enter
upon
generalities
generalities
are
sometimes
extremely
serviceable
i
try
to
inculcate
into
monsieur
gelis
some
respect
for
that
generation
of
historians
to
which
i
belong
i
say
to
him
history
which
was
formerly
an
art
and
which
afforded
place
for
the
fullest
exercise
of
the
imagination
has
in
our
time
become
a
science
the
study
of
which
demands
absolute
exactness
of
gelis
asks
leave
to
differ
from
me
on
this
subject
he
tells
me
he
does
not
believe
that
history
is
a
science
or
that
it
could
possibly
ever
become
a
science
in
the
first
place
he
says
to
me
what
is
history
the
written
representation
of
past
events
but
what
is
an
event
is
it
merely
a
commonplace
fact
it
is
any
fact
no
you
say
yourself
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
now
how
is
the
historian
to
tell
whether
a
fact
is
noteworthy
or
not
he
judges
it
arbitrarily
according
to
his
tastes
and
his
caprices
and
his
ideas
in
short
as
an
artist
for
facts
can
not
by
reason
of
their
own
intrinsic
character
be
divided
into
historical
facts
and
facts
but
any
fact
is
something
exceedingly
complex
will
the
historian
represent
facts
in
all
their
complexity
no
that
is
impossible
then
he
will
represent
them
stripped
of
the
greater
part
of
the
peculiarities
which
constituted
them
and
consequently
lopped
mutilated
different
from
what
they
really
were
as
for
the
of
facts
needless
to
speak
of
it
if
a
historical
fact
be
brought
into
notice
as
is
very
possible
by
one
or
more
facts
which
are
not
historical
at
all
and
are
for
that
very
reason
unknown
how
is
the
historian
going
to
establish
the
relation
of
these
facts
one
to
another
and
in
saying
this
monsieur
bonnard
i
am
supposing
that
the
historian
has
positive
evidence
before
him
whereas
in
reality
he
feels
confidence
only
in
such
or
such
a
witness
for
sympathetic
reasons
history
is
not
a
science
it
is
an
art
and
one
can
succeed
in
that
art
only
through
the
exercise
of
his
faculty
of
monsieur
gelis
reminds
me
very
much
at
this
moment
of
a
certain
young
fool
whom
i
heard
talking
wildly
one
day
in
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
under
the
statue
of
marguerite
of
navarre
but
at
another
turn
of
the
conversation
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
walter
scott
whose
work
my
disdainful
young
friend
pleases
to
term
rococo
troubadourish
and
only
fit
to
inspire
somebody
engaged
in
making
designs
for
cheap
bronze
those
are
his
very
words
why
i
exclaim
zealous
to
defend
the
magnificent
creator
of
the
bride
of
lammermoor
and
the
fair
maid
of
perth
the
whole
past
lives
in
those
admirable
novels
of
his
that
is
history
that
is
epic
it
is
frippery
gelis
answers
me
and
will
you
believe
it
this
crazy
boy
actually
tells
me
that
no
matter
how
learned
one
may
be
one
can
not
possibly
know
just
how
men
used
to
live
five
or
ten
centuries
ago
because
it
is
only
with
the
very
greatest
difficulty
that
one
can
picture
them
to
oneself
even
as
they
were
only
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
in
his
opinion
the
historical
poem
the
historical
novel
the
historical
painting
are
all
according
to
their
kind
abominably
false
as
branches
of
art
in
all
the
arts
he
adds
the
artist
can
only
reflect
his
own
soul
his
work
no
matter
how
it
may
be
dressed
up
is
of
necessity
contemporary
with
himself
being
the
reflection
of
his
own
mind
what
do
we
admire
in
the
divine
comedy
unless
it
be
the
great
soul
of
dante
and
the
marbles
of
michael
angelo
what
do
they
represent
to
us
that
is
at
all
extraordinary
unless
it
be
michael
angelo
himself
the
artist
either
communicates
his
own
life
to
his
creations
or
else
merely
whittles
out
puppets
and
dresses
up
what
a
torrent
of
paradoxes
and
irreverences
but
boldness
in
a
young
man
is
not
displeasing
to
me
gelis
gets
up
from
his
chair
and
sits
down
again
i
know
perfectly
well
what
is
worrying
him
and
whom
he
is
waiting
for
and
now
he
begins
to
talk
to
me
about
his
being
able
to
make
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
to
which
he
can
add
the
revenue
he
derives
from
a
little
property
that
he
has
inherited
two
thousand
francs
a
year
more
and
i
am
not
in
the
least
deceived
as
to
the
purpose
of
these
confidences
on
his
part
i
know
perfectly
well
that
he
is
only
making
his
little
financial
statements
in
order
to
persuade
me
that
he
is
comfortably
circumstanced
steady
fond
of
home
comparatively
independent
or
to
put
the
matter
in
the
fewest
words
possible
able
to
marry
quod
erat
demonstrandum
as
the
geometricians
say
he
has
got
up
and
sat
down
just
twenty
times
he
now
rises
for
the
time
and
as
he
has
not
been
able
to
see
jeanne
he
goes
away
feeling
as
unhappy
as
possible
the
moment
he
has
gone
jeanne
comes
into
the
city
of
books
under
the
pretext
of
looking
for
hannibal
she
is
also
quite
unhappy
and
her
voice
becomes
singularly
plaintive
as
she
calls
her
pet
to
give
him
some
milk
look
at
that
sad
little
face
bonnard
tyrant
gaze
upon
thy
work
thou
hast
been
able
to
keep
them
from
seeing
each
other
but
they
have
now
both
of
them
the
same
expression
of
countenance
and
thou
mayest
discern
from
that
similarity
of
expression
that
in
spite
of
thee
they
are
united
in
thought
cassandra
be
happy
bartholo
rejoice
this
is
what
it
means
to
be
a
guardian
just
see
her
kneeling
down
there
on
the
carpet
with
hannibal
s
head
between
her
hands
yes
caress
the
stupid
animal
pity
him
moan
over
him
we
know
very
well
you
little
rogue
the
real
cause
of
all
these
sighs
and
plaints
nevertheless
it
makes
a
very
pretty
picture
i
look
at
it
for
a
long
time
then
throwing
a
glance
around
my
library
i
exclaim
jeanne
i
am
tired
of
all
those
books
we
must
sell
september
it
is
done
they
are
betrothed
gelis
who
is
an
orphan
as
jeanne
is
did
not
make
his
proposal
to
me
in
person
he
got
one
of
his
professors
an
old
colleague
of
mine
highly
esteemed
for
his
learning
and
character
to
come
to
me
on
his
behalf
but
what
a
love
messenger
great
heavens
a
bear
neat
a
bear
of
the
pyrenees
but
a
literary
bear
and
this
latter
variety
of
bear
is
much
more
ferocious
than
the
former
right
or
wrong
in
my
opinion
wrong
gelis
says
that
he
does
not
want
any
dowry
he
takes
your
ward
with
nothing
but
her
chemise
say
yes
and
the
thing
is
settled
make
haste
about
it
i
want
to
show
you
two
or
three
very
curious
old
tokens
from
lorraine
which
i
am
sure
you
never
saw
that
is
literally
what
he
said
to
me
i
answered
him
that
i
would
consult
jeanne
and
i
found
no
small
pleasure
in
telling
him
that
my
ward
had
a
dowry
her
dowry
there
it
is
in
front
of
me
it
is
my
library
henri
and
jeanne
have
not
even
the
faintest
suspicion
about
it
and
the
fact
is
i
am
commonly
believed
to
be
much
richer
than
i
am
i
have
the
face
of
an
old
miser
it
is
certainly
a
lying
face
but
its
untruthfulness
has
often
won
for
me
a
great
deal
of
consideration
there
is
nobody
so
much
respected
in
this
world
as
a
stingy
rich
man
i
have
consulted
jeanne
but
what
was
the
need
of
listening
for
her
answer
it
is
done
they
are
betrothed
it
would
ill
become
my
character
as
well
as
my
face
to
watch
these
young
people
any
longer
for
the
mere
purpose
of
noting
down
their
words
and
gestures
noli
me
tangere
that
is
the
maxim
for
all
charming
love
affairs
i
know
my
duty
it
is
to
respect
all
the
little
secrets
of
that
innocent
soul
intrusted
to
me
let
these
children
love
each
other
all
they
can
never
a
word
of
their
fervent
outpouring
of
mutual
confidences
never
a
hint
of
their
artless
will
be
set
down
in
this
diary
by
the
old
guardian
whose
authority
was
so
gentle
and
so
brief
at
all
events
i
am
not
going
to
remain
with
my
arms
folded
and
if
they
have
their
business
to
attend
to
i
have
mine
also
i
am
preparing
a
catalogue
of
my
books
with
a
view
to
having
them
all
sold
at
auction
it
is
a
task
which
saddens
and
amuses
me
at
the
same
time
i
linger
over
it
perhaps
a
good
deal
longer
than
i
ought
to
do
turning
the
leaves
of
all
those
works
which
have
become
so
familiar
to
my
thought
to
my
touch
to
my
sight
even
out
of
all
necessity
and
reason
but
it
is
a
farewell
and
it
has
ever
been
in
the
nature
of
man
to
prolong
a
farewell
this
ponderous
volume
here
which
has
served
me
so
much
for
thirty
long
years
how
can
i
leave
it
without
according
it
every
kindness
that
a
faithful
servant
deserves
and
this
one
again
which
has
so
often
consoled
me
by
its
wholesome
doctrines
must
i
not
bow
down
before
it
for
the
last
time
as
to
a
master
but
each
time
that
i
meet
with
a
volume
which
led
me
into
error
which
ever
afflicted
me
with
false
dates
omissions
lies
and
other
plagues
of
the
archaeologist
i
say
to
it
with
bitter
joy
go
imposter
traitor
flee
thou
far
away
from
me
for
ever
vade
retro
all
absurdly
covered
with
gold
as
thou
art
and
i
pray
it
may
befall
thee
thanks
to
thy
usurped
reputation
and
thy
comely
morocco
attire
to
take
thy
place
in
the
cabinet
of
some
whom
thou
wilt
never
be
able
to
seduce
as
thou
has
seduced
me
because
he
will
never
read
one
single
line
of
i
laid
aside
some
books
i
must
always
keep
those
books
which
were
given
to
me
as
souvenirs
as
i
placed
among
them
the
manuscript
of
the
golden
legend
i
could
not
but
kiss
it
in
memory
of
madame
trepof
who
remained
grateful
to
me
in
spite
of
her
high
position
and
all
her
wealth
and
who
became
my
benefactress
merely
to
prove
to
me
that
she
felt
i
had
once
done
her
a
kindness
thus
i
had
made
a
reserve
it
was
then
that
for
the
first
time
i
felt
myself
inclined
to
commit
a
deliberate
crime
all
through
that
night
i
was
strongly
tempted
by
morning
the
temptation
had
become
irresistible
everybody
else
in
the
house
was
still
asleep
i
got
out
of
bed
and
stole
softly
from
my
room
ye
powers
of
darkness
ye
phantoms
of
the
night
if
while
lingering
within
my
home
after
the
crowing
of
the
cock
you
saw
me
stealing
about
on
tiptoe
in
the
city
of
books
you
certainly
never
cried
out
as
madame
trepof
did
at
naples
that
old
man
has
a
round
back
i
entered
the
library
hannibal
with
his
tail
perpendicularly
erected
came
to
rub
himself
against
my
legs
and
purr
i
seized
a
volume
from
its
shelf
some
venerable
gothic
text
or
some
noble
poet
of
the
renaissance
the
jewel
the
treasure
which
i
had
been
dreaming
about
all
night
i
seized
it
and
slipped
it
away
into
the
very
bottom
of
the
closet
which
i
had
reserved
for
those
books
i
intended
to
retain
and
which
soon
became
full
almost
to
bursting
it
is
horrible
to
relate
i
was
stealing
from
the
dowry
of
jeanne
and
when
the
crime
had
been
consummated
i
set
myself
again
sturdily
to
the
task
of
cataloguing
until
jeanne
came
to
consult
me
in
regard
to
something
about
a
dress
or
a
trousseau
i
could
not
possibly
understand
just
what
she
was
talking
about
through
my
total
ignorance
of
the
current
vocabulary
of
and
ah
if
a
bride
of
the
fourteenth
century
had
come
to
talk
to
me
about
the
apparel
of
her
epoch
then
indeed
i
should
have
been
able
to
understand
her
language
but
jeanne
does
not
belong
to
my
time
and
i
have
to
send
her
to
madame
de
gabry
who
on
this
important
occasion
will
take
the
place
of
her
mother
night
has
come
leaning
from
the
window
we
gaze
at
the
vast
sombre
stretch
of
the
city
below
us
pierced
with
multitudinous
points
of
light
jeanne
presses
her
hand
to
her
forehead
as
she
leans
upon
the
and
seems
a
little
sad
and
i
say
to
myself
as
i
watch
her
all
changes
even
the
most
longed
for
have
their
melancholy
for
what
we
leave
behind
us
is
a
part
of
ourselves
we
must
die
to
one
life
before
we
can
enter
into
another
and
as
if
answering
my
thought
the
young
girl
murmurs
to
me
my
guardian
i
am
so
happy
and
still
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
cry
the
last
page
august
page
only
twenty
lines
more
and
i
shall
have
finished
my
book
about
insects
and
flowers
page
and
last
as
we
have
already
seen
the
visits
of
insects
are
of
the
utmost
importance
to
plants
since
their
duty
is
to
carry
to
the
pistils
the
pollen
of
the
stamens
it
seems
also
that
the
flower
itself
is
arranged
and
made
attractive
for
the
purpose
of
inviting
this
nuptial
visit
i
think
i
have
been
able
to
show
that
the
nectary
of
the
plant
distils
a
sugary
liquid
which
attracts
the
insects
and
obliges
it
to
aid
unconsciously
in
the
work
of
direct
or
cross
fertilisation
the
last
method
of
fertilisation
is
the
more
common
i
have
shown
that
flowers
are
coloured
and
perfumed
so
as
to
attract
insects
and
interiorly
so
constructed
as
to
offer
those
visitors
such
a
mode
of
access
that
they
can
not
penetrate
into
the
corolla
without
depositing
upon
the
stigma
the
pollen
with
which
they
have
been
covered
my
most
venerated
master
sprengel
observes
in
regard
to
that
fine
down
which
lines
the
corolla
of
the
the
wise
author
of
nature
has
never
created
a
single
useless
hair
i
say
in
my
turn
if
that
lily
of
the
valley
whereof
the
gospel
makes
mention
is
more
richly
clad
than
king
solomon
in
all
his
glory
its
mantle
of
purple
is
a
and
that
rich
apparel
is
necessary
to
the
perpetuation
of
the
brolles
august
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
was
not
aware
that
several
very
illustrious
naturalists
were
making
researches
at
the
same
time
as
he
in
regard
to
the
relation
between
insects
and
plants
he
was
not
acquainted
with
the
labours
of
darwin
with
those
of
hermann
muller
nor
with
the
observations
of
sir
john
lubbock
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
conclusions
of
monsieur
sylvestre
bonnard
are
very
nearly
similar
to
those
reached
by
the
three
scientists
above
mentioned
less
important
but
perhaps
equally
interesting
is
the
fact
that
sir
john
lubbock
is
like
monsieur
bonnard
an
archaeologist
who
began
to
devote
himself
only
late
in
life
to
the
natural
note
by
the
french
editor
brolles
my
house
is
the
last
one
you
pass
in
the
single
street
of
the
village
as
you
go
to
the
woods
it
is
a
gabled
house
with
a
slate
roof
which
takes
iridescent
tints
in
the
sun
like
a
pigeon
s
breast
the
above
that
roof
has
won
more
consideration
for
me
among
the
country
people
than
all
my
works
upon
history
and
philology
there
is
not
a
single
child
who
does
not
know
monsieur
bonnard
s
it
is
rusty
and
squeaks
very
sharply
in
the
wind
sometimes
it
refuses
to
do
any
work
at
all
just
like
therese
who
now
allows
herself
to
be
assisted
by
a
young
peasant
girl
though
she
grumbles
a
good
deal
about
it
the
house
is
not
large
but
i
am
very
comfortable
in
it
my
room
has
two
windows
and
gets
the
sun
in
the
morning
the
children
s
room
is
upstairs
jeanne
and
henri
come
twice
a
year
to
occupy
it
little
sylvestre
s
cradle
used
to
be
in
it
he
was
a
very
pretty
child
but
very
pale
when
he
used
to
play
on
the
grass
his
mother
would
watch
him
very
anxiously
and
every
little
while
she
would
stop
her
sewing
in
order
to
take
him
upon
her
lap
the
poor
little
fellow
never
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
he
used
to
say
that
when
he
was
asleep
he
would
go
away
very
far
away
to
some
place
where
it
was
all
dark
and
where
he
saw
things
that
made
him
afraid
things
he
never
wanted
to
see
again
then
his
mother
would
call
me
and
i
would
sit
down
beside
his
cradle
he
would
take
one
of
my
fingers
in
his
little
dry
warm
hand
and
say
to
me
godfather
you
must
tell
me
a
then
i
would
tell
him
all
kinds
of
stories
which
he
would
listen
to
very
seriously
they
all
interested
him
but
there
was
one
especially
which
filled
his
little
soul
with
delight
it
was
the
blue
whenever
i
finished
that
he
would
say
to
me
tell
it
again
tell
it
again
and
i
would
tell
it
again
until
his
little
pale
head
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
in
slumber
the
doctor
used
to
answer
all
our
questions
by
saying
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
the
matter
with
him
no
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
the
matter
with
little
sylvestre
one
evening
last
year
his
father
called
me
come
he
said
the
little
one
is
still
i
approached
the
cradle
over
which
the
mother
hung
motionless
as
if
tied
down
above
it
by
all
the
powers
of
her
soul
little
sylvestre
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
their
pupils
had
already
rolled
up
beneath
his
eyelids
and
could
not
descend
again
godfather
he
said
you
are
not
to
tell
me
any
more
no
i
was
not
to
tell
him
any
more
stories
poor
jeanne
poor
mother
i
am
too
old
now
to
feel
very
deeply
but
how
strangely
painful
a
mystery
is
the
death
of
a
child
the
father
and
mother
have
come
to
pass
six
weeks
under
the
old
man
s
roof
i
see
them
now
returning
from
the
woods
walking
jeanne
is
closely
wrapped
in
her
black
shawl
and
henri
wears
a
crape
band
on
his
straw
hat
but
they
are
both
of
them
radiant
with
youth
and
they
smile
very
sweetly
at
each
other
they
smile
at
the
earth
which
sustains
them
they
smile
at
the
air
which
bathes
them
they
smile
at
the
light
which
each
one
sees
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
from
my
window
i
wave
my
handkerchief
at
them
and
they
smile
at
my
old
age
jeanne
comes
running
lightly
up
the
stairs
she
kisses
me
and
then
whispers
in
my
ear
something
which
i
divine
rather
than
hear
and
i
make
answer
to
her
may
god
s
blessing
be
with
you
jeanne
and
with
your
husband
and
with
your
children
and
with
your
children
s
children
for
ever
