story
of
the
two
dogs
in
the
western
part
of
england
lived
a
gentleman
of
great
fortune
whose
name
was
merton
he
had
a
large
estate
in
the
island
of
jamaica
where
he
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
and
was
master
of
many
servants
who
cultivated
sugar
and
other
valuable
things
for
his
advantage
he
had
only
one
son
of
whom
he
was
excessively
fond
and
to
educate
this
child
properly
was
the
reason
of
his
determining
to
stay
some
years
in
england
tommy
merton
who
at
the
time
he
came
from
jamaica
was
only
six
years
old
was
naturally
a
very
boy
but
unfortunately
had
been
spoiled
by
too
much
indulgence
while
he
lived
in
jamaica
he
had
several
black
servants
to
wait
upon
him
who
were
forbidden
upon
any
account
to
contradict
him
if
he
walked
there
always
went
two
negroes
with
him
one
of
whom
carried
a
large
umbrella
to
keep
the
sun
from
him
and
the
other
was
to
carry
him
in
his
arms
whenever
he
was
tired
besides
this
he
was
always
dressed
in
silk
or
laced
clothes
and
had
a
fine
gilded
carriage
which
was
borne
upon
men
shoulders
in
which
he
made
visits
to
his
his
mother
was
so
excessively
fond
of
him
that
she
gave
him
everything
he
cried
for
and
would
never
let
him
learn
to
read
because
he
complained
that
it
made
his
head
ache
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
though
master
merton
had
everything
he
wanted
he
became
very
fretful
and
unhappy
sometimes
he
ate
sweetmeats
till
he
made
himself
sick
and
then
he
suffered
a
great
deal
of
pain
because
he
would
not
take
bitter
physic
to
make
him
well
sometimes
he
cried
for
things
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
him
and
then
as
he
had
never
been
used
to
be
contradicted
it
was
many
hours
before
he
could
be
pacified
when
any
company
came
to
dine
at
the
house
he
was
always
to
be
helped
first
and
to
have
the
most
delicate
parts
of
the
meat
otherwise
he
would
make
such
a
noise
as
disturbed
the
whole
company
when
his
father
and
mother
were
sitting
at
the
with
their
friends
instead
of
waiting
till
they
were
at
leisure
to
attend
him
he
would
scramble
upon
the
table
seize
the
cake
and
bread
and
butter
and
frequently
overset
the
by
these
pranks
he
not
only
made
himself
disagreeable
to
everybody
else
but
often
met
with
very
dangerous
accidents
frequently
did
he
cut
himself
with
knives
at
other
times
throw
heavy
things
upon
his
head
and
once
he
narrowly
escaped
being
scalded
to
death
by
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
he
was
also
so
delicately
brought
up
that
he
was
perpetually
ill
the
least
wind
or
rain
gave
him
a
cold
and
the
least
sun
was
sure
to
throw
him
into
a
fever
instead
of
playing
about
and
jumping
and
running
like
other
children
he
was
taught
to
sit
still
for
fear
of
spoiling
his
clothes
and
to
stay
in
the
house
for
fear
of
injuring
his
complexion
by
this
kind
of
education
when
master
merton
came
over
to
england
he
could
neither
write
nor
read
nor
cipher
he
could
use
none
of
his
limbs
with
ease
nor
bear
any
degree
of
fatigue
but
he
was
very
proud
fretful
and
impatient
very
near
to
mr
merton
seat
lived
a
plain
honest
farmer
whose
name
was
sandford
this
man
had
like
mr
merton
an
only
son
not
much
older
than
master
merton
whose
name
was
harry
harry
as
he
had
been
always
accustomed
to
run
about
in
the
fields
to
follow
the
labourers
while
they
were
ploughing
and
to
drive
the
sheep
to
their
pasture
was
active
strong
hardy
and
he
was
neither
so
fair
nor
so
delicately
shaped
as
master
merton
but
he
had
an
honest
countenance
which
made
everybody
love
him
was
never
out
of
humour
and
took
the
greatest
pleasure
in
obliging
everybody
if
little
harry
saw
a
poor
wretch
who
wanted
victuals
while
he
was
eating
his
dinner
he
was
sure
to
give
him
half
and
sometimes
the
whole
nay
so
very
was
he
to
everything
that
he
would
never
go
into
the
fields
to
take
the
eggs
of
poor
birds
or
their
young
ones
nor
practise
any
other
kind
of
sport
which
gave
pain
to
poor
animals
who
are
as
capable
of
feeling
as
we
ourselves
though
they
have
no
words
to
express
their
sufferings
once
indeed
harry
was
caught
twirling
a
round
which
he
had
fastened
by
a
crooked
pin
to
a
long
piece
of
thread
but
then
this
was
through
ignorance
and
want
of
thought
for
as
soon
as
his
father
told
him
that
the
poor
helpless
insect
felt
as
much
or
more
than
he
would
do
were
a
knife
thrust
through
his
hand
he
burst
into
tears
and
took
the
poor
animal
home
where
he
fed
him
during
a
fortnight
upon
fresh
leaves
and
when
he
was
perfectly
recovered
turned
him
out
to
enjoy
liberty
and
fresh
air
ever
since
that
time
harry
was
so
careful
and
considerate
that
he
would
step
out
of
the
way
for
fear
of
hurting
a
worm
and
employed
himself
in
doing
kind
offices
to
all
the
animals
in
the
neighbourhood
he
used
to
stroke
the
horses
as
they
were
at
work
and
fill
his
pockets
with
acorns
for
the
pigs
if
he
walked
in
the
fields
he
was
sure
to
gather
green
boughs
for
the
sheep
who
were
so
fond
of
him
that
they
followed
him
wherever
he
went
in
the
winter
time
when
the
ground
was
covered
with
frost
and
snow
and
the
poor
little
birds
could
get
at
no
food
he
would
often
go
supperless
to
bed
that
he
might
feed
the
even
toads
and
frogs
and
spiders
and
such
kinds
of
disagreeable
animals
which
most
people
destroy
wherever
they
find
them
were
perfectly
safe
with
harry
he
used
to
say
they
had
a
right
to
live
as
well
as
we
and
that
it
was
cruel
and
unjust
to
kill
creatures
only
because
we
did
not
like
them
these
sentiments
made
little
harry
a
great
favourite
with
everybody
particularly
with
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
who
became
so
fond
of
him
that
he
taught
him
to
read
and
write
and
had
him
almost
always
with
him
indeed
it
was
not
surprising
that
mr
barlow
showed
so
particular
an
affection
for
him
for
besides
learning
with
the
greatest
readiness
everything
that
was
taught
him
little
harry
was
the
most
honest
obliging
creature
in
the
world
he
was
never
discontented
nor
did
he
ever
grumble
whatever
he
was
desired
to
do
and
then
you
might
believe
harry
in
everything
he
said
for
though
he
could
have
gained
a
by
telling
an
untruth
and
was
sure
that
speaking
the
truth
would
expose
him
to
a
severe
whipping
he
never
hesitated
in
declaring
it
nor
was
he
like
many
other
children
who
place
their
whole
happiness
in
eating
for
give
him
but
a
morsel
of
dry
bread
for
his
dinner
and
he
would
be
satisfied
though
you
placed
sweetmeats
and
fruit
and
every
other
nicety
in
his
way
with
this
little
boy
did
master
merton
become
acquainted
in
the
following
manner
as
he
and
the
maid
were
once
walking
in
the
fields
on
a
fine
summer
morning
diverting
themselves
with
gathering
different
kinds
of
wild
flowers
and
running
after
butterflies
a
large
snake
on
a
sudden
started
up
from
among
some
long
grass
and
coiled
itself
round
little
tommy
leg
you
may
imagine
the
fright
they
were
both
in
at
this
accident
the
maid
ran
away
shrieking
for
help
while
the
child
who
was
in
an
agony
of
terror
did
not
dare
to
stir
from
the
place
where
he
was
standing
harry
who
happened
to
be
walking
near
the
place
came
running
up
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
tommy
who
was
sobbing
most
piteously
could
not
find
words
to
tell
him
but
pointed
to
his
leg
and
made
harry
sensible
of
what
had
happened
harry
who
though
young
was
a
boy
of
a
most
courageous
spirit
told
him
not
to
be
frightened
and
instantly
seizing
the
snake
by
the
neck
with
as
much
dexterity
as
resolution
tore
him
from
tommy
leg
and
threw
him
to
a
great
distance
off
illustration
harry
instantly
seizing
the
snake
by
the
neck
with
as
much
dexterity
as
resolution
tore
him
from
tommy
leg
and
threw
him
to
a
great
distance
off
just
as
this
happened
mrs
merton
and
all
the
family
alarmed
by
the
servant
cries
came
running
breathless
to
the
place
as
tommy
was
recovering
his
spirits
and
thanking
his
brave
little
deliverer
her
first
emotions
were
to
catch
her
darling
up
in
her
arms
and
after
giving
him
a
thousand
kisses
to
ask
him
whether
he
had
received
any
hurt
no
said
tommy
indeed
i
have
not
mamma
but
i
believe
that
nasty
ugly
beast
would
have
bitten
me
if
that
little
boy
had
not
come
and
pulled
him
off
and
who
are
you
my
dear
said
she
to
whom
we
are
all
so
obliged
harry
sandford
madam
well
my
child
you
are
a
dear
brave
little
creature
and
you
shall
go
home
and
dine
with
us
no
thank
you
madam
my
father
will
want
me
and
who
is
your
father
my
sweet
boy
farmer
sandford
madam
that
lives
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
well
my
dear
you
shall
be
my
child
henceforth
will
you
if
you
please
madam
if
i
may
have
my
own
father
and
mother
too
mrs
merton
instantly
despatched
a
servant
to
the
farmer
and
taking
little
harry
by
the
hand
she
led
him
to
the
where
she
found
mr
merton
whom
she
entertained
with
a
long
account
of
danger
and
harry
bravery
harry
was
now
in
a
new
scene
of
life
he
was
carried
through
costly
apartments
where
everything
that
could
please
the
eye
or
contribute
to
convenience
was
assembled
he
saw
large
in
gilded
frames
carved
tables
and
chairs
curtains
made
of
the
finest
silk
and
the
very
plates
and
knives
and
forks
were
of
silver
at
dinner
he
was
placed
close
to
mrs
merton
who
took
care
to
supply
him
with
the
choicest
bits
and
engaged
him
to
eat
with
the
most
endearing
kindness
but
to
the
astonishment
of
everybody
he
neither
appeared
pleased
nor
surprised
at
anything
he
saw
mrs
merton
could
not
conceal
her
disappointment
for
as
she
had
always
been
used
to
a
great
degree
of
finery
herself
she
had
expected
it
should
make
the
same
impression
upon
everybody
else
at
last
seeing
him
eye
a
small
silver
cup
with
great
attention
out
of
which
he
had
been
drinking
she
asked
him
whether
he
should
not
like
to
have
such
a
fine
thing
to
drink
out
of
and
added
that
though
it
was
tommy
cup
she
was
sure
he
would
with
great
pleasure
give
it
to
his
little
friend
yes
that
i
will
says
tommy
for
you
know
mamma
i
have
a
much
finer
one
than
that
made
of
gold
besides
two
large
ones
made
of
silver
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
said
little
harry
but
i
will
not
rob
you
of
it
for
i
have
a
much
better
one
at
home
how
said
mrs
merton
does
your
father
eat
and
drink
out
of
silver
i
do
know
madam
what
you
call
this
but
we
drink
at
home
out
of
long
things
made
of
horn
just
such
as
the
cows
wear
upon
their
heads
the
child
is
a
simpleton
i
think
said
mrs
merton
and
why
is
that
better
than
silver
ones
because
said
harry
they
never
make
us
uneasy
make
you
uneasy
my
child
said
mrs
merton
what
do
you
mean
why
madam
when
the
man
threw
that
great
thing
down
which
looks
just
like
this
i
saw
that
you
were
very
sorry
about
it
and
looked
as
if
you
had
been
just
ready
to
drop
now
ours
at
home
are
thrown
about
by
all
the
family
and
nobody
minds
it
i
protest
said
mrs
merton
to
her
husband
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
boy
he
makes
such
strange
observations
the
fact
was
that
during
dinner
one
of
the
servants
had
thrown
down
a
large
piece
of
plate
which
as
it
was
very
valuable
had
made
mrs
merton
not
only
look
very
uneasy
but
give
the
man
a
very
severe
scolding
for
his
carelessness
after
dinner
mrs
merton
filled
a
large
glass
of
wine
and
giving
it
to
harry
bade
him
drink
it
up
but
he
thanked
her
and
said
he
was
not
dry
but
my
dear
said
she
this
is
very
sweet
and
pleasant
and
as
you
are
a
good
boy
you
may
drink
it
up
ay
but
madam
mr
barlow
says
that
we
must
only
eat
when
we
are
hungry
and
drink
when
we
are
dry
and
that
we
must
only
eat
and
drink
such
things
are
as
easily
met
with
otherwise
we
shall
grow
peevish
and
vexed
when
we
ca
get
them
and
this
was
the
way
that
the
apostles
did
who
were
all
very
good
men
mr
merton
laughed
at
this
and
pray
said
he
little
man
do
you
know
who
the
apostles
were
oh
yes
to
be
sure
i
do
and
who
were
they
why
sir
there
was
a
time
when
people
were
grown
so
very
wicked
that
they
did
not
care
what
they
did
and
the
great
folks
were
all
proud
and
minded
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
and
amusing
themselves
and
took
no
care
of
the
poor
and
would
not
give
a
morsel
of
bread
to
hinder
a
beggar
from
starving
and
the
poor
were
all
lazy
and
loved
to
be
idle
better
than
to
work
and
little
boys
were
disobedient
to
their
parents
and
their
parents
took
no
care
to
teach
them
anything
that
was
good
and
all
the
world
was
very
bad
very
bad
indeed
and
then
there
came
from
heaven
the
son
of
god
whose
name
was
christ
and
he
went
about
doing
good
to
everybody
and
curing
people
of
all
sorts
of
diseases
and
taught
them
what
they
ought
to
do
and
he
chose
out
twelve
other
very
good
men
and
called
them
apostles
and
these
apostles
went
about
the
world
doing
as
he
did
and
teaching
people
as
he
taught
them
and
they
never
minded
what
they
did
eat
or
drink
but
lived
upon
dry
bread
and
water
and
when
anybody
offered
them
money
they
would
not
take
it
but
told
them
to
be
good
and
give
it
to
the
poor
and
sick
and
so
they
made
the
world
a
great
deal
better
and
therefore
it
is
not
fit
to
mind
what
we
live
upon
but
we
should
take
what
we
can
get
and
be
contented
just
as
the
beasts
and
birds
do
who
lodge
in
the
open
air
and
live
upon
herbs
and
drink
nothing
but
water
and
yet
they
are
strong
and
active
and
healthy
upon
my
word
said
mr
merton
this
little
man
is
a
great
philosopher
and
we
should
be
much
obliged
to
mr
barlow
if
he
would
take
our
tommy
under
his
care
for
he
grows
a
great
boy
and
it
is
time
that
he
should
know
something
what
say
you
tommy
should
you
like
to
be
a
philosopher
indeed
papa
i
do
know
what
a
philosopher
is
but
i
should
like
to
be
a
king
because
he
finer
and
richer
than
anybody
else
and
has
nothing
to
do
and
everybody
waits
upon
him
and
is
afraid
of
him
well
said
my
dear
replied
mrs
merton
and
rose
and
kissed
him
and
a
king
you
deserve
to
be
with
such
a
spirit
and
here
a
glass
of
wine
for
you
for
making
such
a
pretty
answer
and
should
you
not
like
to
be
a
king
too
little
harry
indeed
madam
i
do
know
what
that
is
but
i
hope
i
shall
soon
be
big
enough
to
go
to
plough
and
get
my
own
living
and
then
i
shall
want
nobody
to
wait
upon
me
what
a
difference
between
the
children
of
farmers
and
gentlemen
whispered
mrs
merton
to
her
husband
looking
rather
contemptuously
upon
harry
i
am
not
sure
said
mr
merton
that
for
this
time
the
advantage
is
on
the
side
of
our
son
but
should
you
not
like
to
be
rich
my
dear
said
he
turning
to
harry
no
indeed
sir
no
simpleton
said
mrs
merton
and
why
not
because
the
only
rich
man
i
ever
saw
is
squire
chase
who
lives
hard
by
and
he
rides
among
people
corn
and
breaks
down
their
hedges
and
shoots
their
poultry
and
kills
their
dogs
and
lames
their
cattle
and
abuses
the
poor
and
they
say
he
does
all
this
because
he
rich
but
everybody
hates
him
though
they
dare
not
tell
him
so
to
his
face
and
i
would
not
be
hated
for
anything
in
the
world
but
should
you
not
like
to
have
a
fine
laced
coat
and
a
coach
to
carry
you
about
and
servants
to
wait
upon
you
as
to
that
madam
one
coat
is
as
good
as
another
if
it
will
but
keep
me
warm
and
i
do
want
to
ride
because
i
can
walk
wherever
i
choose
and
as
to
servants
i
should
have
nothing
for
them
to
do
if
i
had
a
hundred
of
them
mrs
merton
continued
to
look
at
him
with
astonishment
but
did
not
ask
him
any
more
questions
in
the
evening
little
harry
was
sent
home
to
his
father
who
asked
him
what
he
had
seen
at
the
great
house
and
how
he
liked
being
there
why
replied
harry
they
were
all
very
kind
to
me
for
which
i
much
obliged
to
them
but
i
had
rather
have
been
at
home
for
i
never
was
so
troubled
in
all
my
life
to
get
a
dinner
there
was
one
man
to
take
away
my
plate
and
another
to
give
me
drink
and
another
to
stand
behind
my
chair
just
as
if
i
had
been
lame
or
blind
and
could
not
have
waited
upon
myself
and
then
there
was
so
much
to
do
with
putting
this
thing
on
and
taking
another
off
i
thought
it
would
never
have
been
over
and
after
dinner
i
was
obliged
to
sit
two
whole
hours
without
ever
stirring
while
the
lady
was
talking
to
me
not
as
mr
barlow
does
but
wanting
me
to
love
fine
clothes
and
to
be
a
king
and
to
be
rich
that
i
may
be
hated
like
squire
chase
but
at
the
much
of
the
conversation
in
the
meantime
was
employed
in
examining
the
merits
of
little
harry
mrs
merton
acknowledged
his
bravery
and
openness
of
temper
she
was
also
struck
with
the
very
and
benevolence
of
his
character
but
she
contended
that
he
had
a
certain
grossness
and
indelicacy
in
his
ideas
which
distinguish
the
children
of
the
lower
and
middling
classes
of
people
from
those
of
persons
of
fashion
mr
merton
on
the
contrary
maintained
that
he
had
never
before
seen
a
child
whose
sentiments
and
disposition
would
do
so
much
honour
even
to
the
most
elevated
situations
nothing
he
affirmed
was
more
easily
acquired
than
those
external
manners
and
that
superficial
address
upon
which
too
many
of
the
higher
classes
pride
themselves
as
their
greatest
or
even
as
their
only
accomplishment
nay
so
easily
are
they
picked
up
said
he
that
we
frequently
see
them
descend
with
the
cast
clothes
to
maids
and
valets
between
whom
and
their
masters
and
mistresses
there
is
little
other
difference
than
what
results
from
the
former
wearing
soiled
clothes
and
healthier
countenances
indeed
the
real
seat
of
all
superiority
even
of
manners
must
be
placed
in
the
mind
dignified
sentiments
superior
courage
accompanied
with
genuine
and
universal
courtesy
are
always
necessary
to
constitute
the
real
gentleman
and
where
these
are
wanting
it
is
the
greatest
absurdity
to
think
they
can
be
supplied
by
affected
tones
of
voice
particular
grimaces
or
extravagant
and
unnatural
modes
of
dress
which
far
from
becoming
the
real
test
of
gentility
have
in
general
no
other
origin
than
the
caprice
of
barbers
tailors
actors
milliners
fiddlers
and
french
servants
of
both
sexes
i
can
not
help
therefore
asserting
said
he
very
seriously
that
this
little
peasant
has
within
his
mind
the
seeds
of
true
gentility
and
dignity
of
character
and
though
i
shall
also
wish
that
our
son
may
possess
all
the
common
accomplishments
of
his
rank
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
a
certainty
that
he
would
never
in
any
respect
fall
below
the
son
of
farmer
sandford
whether
mrs
merton
fully
acceded
to
these
observations
of
her
husband
i
can
not
decide
but
without
waiting
to
hear
her
particular
sentiments
he
thus
went
on
should
i
appear
more
warm
than
usual
upon
this
subject
you
must
pardon
me
my
dear
and
attribute
it
to
the
interest
i
feel
in
the
welfare
of
our
little
tommy
i
am
too
sensible
that
our
mutual
fondness
has
hitherto
treated
him
with
rather
too
much
indulgence
while
we
have
been
to
remove
from
him
every
painful
and
disagreeable
impression
we
have
made
him
too
delicate
and
fretful
our
desire
of
constantly
consulting
his
inclinations
has
made
us
gratify
even
his
caprices
and
humours
and
while
we
have
been
too
studious
to
preserve
him
from
restraint
and
opposition
we
have
in
reality
been
ourselves
the
cause
that
he
has
not
acquired
even
the
common
attainments
of
his
age
and
situation
all
this
i
have
long
observed
in
silence
but
have
hitherto
concealed
both
from
my
fondness
for
our
child
and
my
fear
of
offending
you
but
at
length
a
consideration
of
his
real
interests
has
prevailed
over
every
other
motive
and
has
compelled
me
to
embrace
a
resolution
which
i
hope
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
that
of
sending
him
directly
to
mr
barlow
provided
he
would
take
the
care
of
him
and
i
think
this
accidental
acquaintance
with
young
sandford
may
prove
the
luckiest
thing
in
the
world
as
he
is
so
nearly
the
age
and
size
of
our
tommy
i
shall
therefore
propose
to
the
farmer
that
i
will
for
some
years
pay
for
the
board
and
education
of
his
little
boy
that
he
may
be
a
constant
companion
to
our
son
as
mr
merton
said
this
with
a
certain
degree
of
firmness
and
the
proposal
was
in
itself
so
reasonable
and
necessary
mrs
merton
did
not
make
any
objection
to
it
but
consented
although
very
reluctantly
to
part
with
her
son
mr
barlow
was
accordingly
invited
to
dinner
the
next
sunday
and
mr
merton
took
an
opportunity
of
introducing
the
subject
and
making
the
proposal
to
him
assuring
him
at
the
same
time
that
though
there
was
no
return
within
the
bounds
of
his
fortune
which
he
would
not
willingly
make
yet
the
education
and
improvement
of
his
son
were
objects
of
so
much
importance
to
him
that
he
should
always
consider
himself
the
obliged
party
to
this
mr
barlow
after
thanking
mr
merton
for
the
confidence
and
liberality
with
which
he
treated
him
answered
him
in
the
following
manner
i
should
be
little
worthy
of
the
distinguished
regard
with
which
you
treat
me
did
i
not
with
the
greatest
sincerity
assure
you
that
i
feel
myself
totally
unqualified
for
the
task
i
am
sir
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
i
would
not
exchange
that
character
and
the
severe
duties
it
enjoins
for
any
other
situation
in
life
but
you
must
be
sensible
that
the
retired
manner
of
life
which
i
have
led
for
these
twenty
years
in
consequence
of
my
profession
at
a
distance
from
the
gaities
of
the
capital
and
the
refinements
of
polite
life
is
little
adapted
to
form
such
a
tutor
as
the
manners
and
opinions
of
the
world
require
for
your
son
gentlemen
in
your
situation
of
life
are
accustomed
to
divide
the
world
into
two
general
classes
those
who
are
persons
of
fashion
and
those
who
are
not
the
first
class
contains
everything
that
is
valuable
in
life
and
therefore
their
manners
their
prejudices
their
very
vices
must
be
inculcated
upon
the
minds
of
children
from
the
earliest
period
of
infancy
the
second
comprehends
the
great
body
of
mankind
who
under
the
general
name
of
the
vulgar
are
represented
as
being
only
objects
of
contempt
and
disgust
and
scarcely
worthy
to
be
put
on
a
footing
with
the
very
beasts
that
contribute
to
the
pleasure
and
convenience
of
their
superiors
mr
merton
could
not
help
interrupting
mr
barlow
here
to
assure
him
that
though
there
was
too
much
truth
in
the
observation
yet
he
must
not
think
that
either
he
or
mrs
merton
carried
things
to
that
extravagant
length
and
that
although
they
wished
their
son
to
have
the
manners
of
a
man
of
fashion
they
thought
his
morals
and
religion
of
infinitely
more
consequence
if
you
think
so
sir
said
mr
barlow
it
is
more
than
a
noble
lord
did
whose
written
opinions
are
now
considered
as
the
oracles
of
polite
life
and
more
than
i
believe
most
of
his
admirers
do
at
this
time
but
if
you
allow
what
i
have
just
mentioned
to
be
the
common
distinctions
of
genteel
people
you
must
at
one
glance
perceive
how
little
i
must
be
qualified
to
educate
a
young
gentleman
intended
to
move
in
that
sphere
i
whose
temper
reason
and
religion
equally
combine
to
make
me
reject
the
principles
upon
which
those
distinctions
are
founded
the
christian
religion
though
not
exclusively
is
emphatically
speaking
the
religion
of
the
poor
its
first
ministers
were
taken
from
the
lower
orders
of
mankind
and
to
the
lower
orders
of
mankind
was
it
first
proposed
and
in
this
instead
of
feeling
myself
mortified
or
ashamed
i
am
the
more
inclined
to
adore
the
wisdom
and
benevolence
of
that
power
by
whose
command
it
was
first
promulgated
those
who
engross
the
riches
and
advantages
of
this
world
are
too
much
employed
with
their
pleasures
and
ambition
to
be
much
interested
about
any
system
either
of
religion
or
of
morals
they
too
frequently
feel
a
species
of
habitual
intoxication
which
excludes
every
serious
thought
and
makes
them
view
with
indifference
everything
but
the
present
moment
those
on
the
contrary
to
whom
all
the
hardships
and
miseries
of
this
world
are
allotted
as
their
natural
portion
those
who
eat
the
bread
of
bitterness
and
drink
the
waters
of
affliction
have
more
interest
in
futurity
and
are
therefore
more
prepared
to
receive
the
promises
of
the
gospel
yes
sir
mark
the
disingenuousness
of
many
of
our
modern
philosophers
they
quarrel
with
the
christian
religion
because
it
has
not
yet
penetrated
the
deserts
of
africa
or
arrested
the
wandering
hordes
of
tartary
yet
they
ridicule
it
for
the
meanness
of
its
origin
and
because
it
is
the
gospel
of
the
poor
that
is
to
say
because
it
is
expressly
calculated
to
inform
the
judgments
and
alleviate
the
miseries
of
that
vast
promiscuous
body
which
constitutes
the
majestic
species
of
man
but
for
whom
would
these
philosophers
have
heaven
itself
interested
if
not
for
the
mighty
whole
which
it
has
created
poverty
that
is
to
say
a
state
of
labour
and
frequent
is
the
natural
state
of
man
it
is
the
state
of
all
in
the
happiest
and
most
equal
governments
the
state
of
nearly
all
in
every
country
it
is
a
state
in
which
all
the
faculties
both
of
body
and
mind
are
always
found
to
develope
themselves
with
the
most
advantage
and
in
which
the
moral
feelings
have
generally
the
greatest
influence
the
accumulation
of
riches
on
the
contrary
can
never
increase
but
by
the
increasing
poverty
and
degradation
of
those
whom
heaven
has
created
equal
a
thousand
cottages
are
thrown
down
to
afford
space
for
a
single
palace
how
benevolently
therefore
has
heaven
acted
in
thus
extending
its
blessings
to
all
who
do
not
disqualify
themselves
for
the
reception
by
voluntary
hardness
of
heart
how
wisely
in
thus
opposing
a
continual
boundary
to
human
pride
and
sensuality
two
passions
the
most
fatal
in
their
effects
and
the
most
apt
to
desolate
the
world
and
shall
a
minister
of
that
gospel
conscious
of
these
great
truths
and
professing
to
govern
himself
by
their
influence
dare
to
preach
a
different
doctrine
and
flatter
those
excesses
which
he
must
know
are
equally
contrary
both
to
reason
and
religion
shall
he
become
the
abject
sycophant
of
human
greatness
and
assist
it
in
trampling
all
relations
of
humanity
beneath
his
feet
instead
of
setting
before
it
the
severe
duties
of
its
station
and
the
account
which
will
one
day
be
expected
of
all
the
opportunities
of
doing
good
so
idly
so
irretrievably
lost
and
squandered
but
i
beg
pardon
sir
for
that
warmth
which
has
transported
me
so
far
and
made
me
engross
so
much
of
the
conversation
but
it
will
at
least
have
this
good
effect
that
it
will
demonstrate
the
truth
of
what
i
have
been
saying
and
show
that
though
i
might
undertake
the
education
of
a
farmer
or
a
mechanic
i
shall
never
succeed
in
that
of
a
modern
gentleman
sir
replied
mr
merton
there
is
nothing
which
i
now
hear
from
you
which
does
not
increase
my
esteem
of
your
character
and
my
desire
to
engage
your
assistance
permit
me
only
to
ask
whether
in
the
present
state
of
things
a
difference
of
conditions
and
an
inequality
of
fortune
are
not
necessary
and
if
necessary
i
should
infer
not
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
christianity
so
it
is
declared
sir
that
offences
must
come
but
that
does
not
prevent
a
severe
denunciation
against
the
offenders
but
if
you
wish
to
know
whether
i
am
one
of
those
enthusiasts
who
are
continually
preaching
up
an
ideal
state
of
perfection
totally
inconsistent
with
human
affairs
i
will
endeavour
to
give
you
every
satisfaction
upon
the
subject
if
you
mean
by
difference
of
conditions
and
inequality
of
fortunes
that
the
present
state
of
human
affairs
in
every
society
we
are
acquainted
with
does
not
admit
that
perfect
equality
which
the
purer
interpretations
of
the
gospel
inculcate
i
certainly
shall
not
disagree
with
you
in
opinion
he
that
formed
the
human
heart
certainly
must
be
acquainted
with
all
the
passions
to
which
it
would
be
subject
and
if
under
the
immediate
dispensation
of
christ
himself
it
was
found
impossible
for
a
rich
man
to
give
his
possessions
to
the
poor
that
degree
of
purity
will
hardly
be
expected
now
which
was
not
found
in
the
origin
but
here
sir
permit
me
to
remark
how
widely
the
principles
of
genuine
christianity
differ
from
that
imaginary
scheme
of
ideal
perfection
equally
inconsistent
with
human
affairs
and
human
characters
which
many
of
its
pretended
friends
would
persuade
us
to
believe
in
and
as
comparisons
sometimes
throw
a
new
and
sudden
light
upon
a
subject
give
me
leave
to
use
one
here
which
i
think
bears
the
closest
analogy
to
what
we
are
now
considering
were
some
physician
to
arise
who
to
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
preceding
medical
facts
had
added
by
a
more
than
human
skill
a
knowledge
of
the
most
secret
principles
of
the
human
frame
could
he
calculate
with
an
accuracy
that
never
was
deceived
the
effect
of
every
cause
that
could
act
upon
our
constitutions
and
were
he
inclined
as
the
result
of
all
his
science
and
observation
to
leave
a
rule
of
life
that
might
remain
unimpeached
to
the
latest
posterity
i
ask
what
kind
of
one
would
he
form
i
suppose
one
said
mr
merton
that
was
the
most
adapted
to
the
general
circumstances
of
the
human
species
and
which
observed
would
confer
the
greatest
degree
of
health
and
vigour
right
said
mr
barlow
i
ask
again
whether
observing
the
common
luxury
and
intemperance
of
the
rich
he
would
take
his
directions
from
the
usages
of
a
polite
table
and
recommend
that
heterogeneous
assemblage
of
contrary
mixtures
high
seasonings
poignant
sauces
fermented
and
distilled
poisons
which
is
continually
breeding
diseases
in
their
veins
as
the
best
means
of
preserving
or
regaining
health
certainly
not
that
were
to
debase
his
heart
and
sanction
abuses
instead
of
reforming
them
would
he
not
then
recommend
simplicity
of
diet
light
repasts
early
slumbers
and
moderate
exercise
in
the
open
air
if
he
judged
them
salutary
to
human
nature
even
though
fashionable
prejudice
had
stamped
all
these
particulars
with
the
mark
of
extreme
vulgarity
were
he
to
act
otherwise
he
must
forfeit
all
pretensions
either
to
honesty
or
skill
let
us
then
apply
all
this
to
the
mind
instead
of
the
body
and
suppose
for
an
instant
that
some
legislator
either
human
or
divine
who
comprehended
all
the
secret
springs
that
govern
the
mind
was
preparing
a
universal
code
for
all
mankind
must
he
not
imitate
the
physician
and
deliver
general
truths
however
unpalatable
however
repugnant
to
particular
prejudices
since
upon
the
observance
of
these
truths
alone
the
happiness
of
the
species
must
depend
i
think
so
indeed
should
such
a
person
observe
that
an
immoderate
desire
and
accumulation
of
riches
a
love
of
ostentatious
trifles
unnecessary
splendour
in
all
that
relates
to
human
life
and
an
habitual
indulgence
of
sensuality
tended
not
only
to
produce
evil
in
all
around
but
even
in
the
individual
himself
who
suffered
the
tyranny
of
these
vices
how
would
you
have
the
legislator
act
should
he
be
silent
no
certainly
he
should
arraign
these
pernicious
habitudes
by
every
means
within
his
power
by
precept
by
example
should
he
also
observe
that
riches
employed
in
another
manner
in
removing
the
real
miseries
of
humanity
in
cherishing
comforting
and
supporting
all
around
produced
a
contrary
effect
and
tended
equally
to
make
the
obliged
and
the
obliger
happy
should
he
conceal
this
great
eternal
truth
or
should
he
divulge
it
with
all
the
authority
he
possessed
conscious
that
in
whatever
degree
it
became
the
rule
of
human
life
in
the
same
degree
would
it
tend
to
the
advantage
of
all
the
world
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
upon
the
subject
but
should
he
know
either
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
or
by
intuitive
penetration
that
the
majority
of
mankind
would
never
observe
these
rules
to
any
great
degree
but
would
be
blindly
precipitated
by
their
passions
into
every
excess
against
which
he
so
benevolently
cautioned
them
should
this
be
a
reason
for
his
withdrawing
his
precepts
and
admonitions
or
for
seeming
to
approve
what
was
in
its
own
nature
most
pernicious
as
prudent
would
it
be
to
pull
off
the
bridle
when
we
mounted
an
impetuous
horse
because
we
doubted
of
our
power
to
hold
him
in
or
to
increase
his
madness
by
the
spur
when
it
was
clearly
too
great
before
thus
sir
you
will
perceive
that
the
precepts
of
the
christian
religion
are
founded
upon
the
most
perfect
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
as
they
furnish
a
continual
barrier
against
the
most
destructive
passions
and
the
most
subversive
of
human
happiness
your
own
concessions
sufficiently
prove
that
it
would
have
been
equally
derogatory
to
truth
and
the
common
interests
of
the
species
to
have
made
the
slightest
concessions
in
favour
either
of
human
pride
or
sensuality
your
extensive
acquaintance
with
mankind
will
sufficiently
convince
you
how
prone
the
generality
are
to
give
an
unbounded
loose
to
these
two
passions
neither
the
continual
experience
of
their
own
weakness
nor
of
the
fatal
effects
which
are
produced
by
vicious
indulgences
has
yet
been
capable
of
teaching
them
either
humility
or
moderation
what
then
could
the
wisest
legislator
do
more
useful
more
benevolent
more
necessary
than
to
establish
general
rules
of
conduct
which
have
a
continual
tendency
to
restore
moral
and
natural
order
and
to
diminish
the
wide
inequality
produced
by
pride
and
avarice
nor
is
there
any
greater
danger
that
these
precepts
should
be
too
rigidly
observed
than
that
the
bulk
of
mankind
should
injure
themselves
by
too
abstemious
a
temperance
all
that
can
be
expected
from
human
weakness
even
after
working
from
the
most
perfect
model
is
barely
to
arrive
at
mediocrity
and
were
the
model
less
perfect
or
the
duties
less
severe
there
is
the
greatest
reason
to
think
that
even
that
mediocrity
would
never
be
attained
examine
the
conduct
of
those
who
are
placed
at
a
distance
from
all
labour
and
fatigue
and
you
will
find
the
most
trifling
exertions
act
upon
their
imaginations
with
the
same
force
as
the
most
insuperable
difficulties
if
i
have
now
succeeded
in
laying
down
the
genuine
principles
of
christian
morality
i
apprehend
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
deduce
the
duty
of
one
who
takes
upon
him
the
office
of
its
minister
and
interpreter
he
can
no
more
have
a
right
to
alter
the
slightest
of
its
principles
than
the
magistrate
can
be
justified
in
giving
false
interpretations
to
the
laws
the
more
the
corruptions
of
the
world
increase
the
greater
the
obligation
that
he
should
oppose
himself
to
their
course
and
he
can
no
more
relax
in
his
opposition
than
the
pilot
can
abandon
the
helm
because
the
winds
and
the
waves
begin
to
augment
their
fury
should
he
be
despised
or
neglected
by
all
the
rest
of
the
human
species
let
him
still
persist
in
bearing
testimony
to
the
truth
both
in
his
precepts
and
example
the
cause
of
virtue
is
not
desperate
while
it
retains
a
single
friend
should
it
even
sink
for
ever
it
is
enough
for
him
to
have
discharged
his
duty
but
although
he
is
thus
restricted
as
to
what
he
shall
teach
i
do
not
assert
that
it
is
improper
for
him
to
use
his
understanding
and
experience
as
to
the
manner
of
his
instruction
he
is
strictly
bound
never
to
teach
anything
contrary
to
the
purest
morality
but
he
is
not
bound
always
to
teach
that
morality
in
its
greatest
extent
in
that
respect
he
may
use
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
though
guided
by
the
innocence
of
the
dove
if
therefore
he
sees
the
reign
of
prejudice
and
corruption
so
firmly
established
that
men
would
be
offended
with
the
genuine
simplicity
of
the
gospel
and
the
purity
of
its
primeval
doctrines
he
may
so
far
moderate
their
rigour
as
to
prevent
them
from
entirely
disgusting
weak
and
luxurious
minds
if
we
can
not
effect
the
greatest
possible
perfection
it
is
still
a
material
point
to
preserve
from
the
grossest
vices
a
physician
that
practises
amongst
the
great
may
certainly
be
excused
though
he
should
not
be
continually
advising
the
exercise
the
regimen
of
the
poor
not
that
the
doctrine
is
not
true
but
that
there
would
not
be
the
smallest
probability
of
its
ever
being
adopted
but
although
he
never
assents
to
that
luxurious
method
of
life
which
he
is
continually
obliged
to
see
he
may
content
himself
with
only
inculcating
those
restrictions
which
even
the
luxurious
may
submit
to
if
they
possess
the
smallest
portion
of
understanding
should
he
succeed
thus
far
there
is
no
reason
for
his
stopping
in
his
career
or
not
enforcing
a
superior
degree
of
temperance
but
should
it
be
difficult
to
persuade
even
so
slight
a
restriction
he
could
hope
for
no
success
were
he
to
preach
up
a
spartan
or
a
roman
diet
thus
the
christian
minister
may
certainly
use
his
own
discretion
in
the
mode
of
conveying
his
instructions
and
it
is
permitted
him
to
employ
all
his
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
in
reclaiming
men
from
their
vices
and
winning
them
over
to
the
cause
of
virtue
by
the
severity
of
his
own
manners
he
may
sufficiently
evince
the
motives
of
his
conduct
nor
can
he
by
any
means
hope
for
more
success
than
if
he
shows
that
he
practises
more
than
he
preaches
and
uses
a
greater
degree
of
indulgence
to
the
failings
of
others
than
he
requires
for
his
own
nothing
said
mr
merton
can
be
more
rational
or
moderate
than
these
sentiments
why
then
do
you
persist
in
pleading
your
incapacity
for
an
employment
which
you
can
so
well
discharge
because
said
mr
barlow
he
that
undertakes
the
education
of
a
child
undertakes
the
most
important
duty
in
society
and
is
severally
answerable
for
every
voluntary
omission
the
same
mode
of
reasoning
which
i
have
just
been
using
is
not
applicable
here
it
is
out
of
the
power
of
any
individual
however
strenuous
may
be
his
endeavours
to
prevent
the
mass
of
mankind
from
acquiring
prejudices
and
corruptions
and
when
he
finds
them
in
that
state
he
certainly
may
use
all
the
wisdom
he
possesses
for
their
reformation
but
this
rule
will
never
justify
him
for
an
instant
in
giving
false
impressions
where
he
is
at
liberty
to
instil
truth
and
in
losing
the
only
opportunity
which
he
perhaps
may
ever
possess
of
teaching
pure
morality
and
religion
how
will
such
a
man
if
he
has
the
least
feeling
bear
to
see
his
pupil
become
a
slave
perhaps
to
the
grossest
vices
and
to
reflect
with
a
great
degree
of
probability
that
this
catastrophe
has
been
owing
to
his
own
inactivity
and
improper
indulgence
may
not
all
human
characters
frequently
be
traced
back
to
impressions
made
at
so
early
a
period
that
none
but
discerning
eyes
would
ever
suspect
their
existence
yet
nothing
is
more
certain
what
we
are
at
twenty
depends
upon
what
we
were
at
fifteen
what
we
are
at
fifteen
upon
what
we
were
at
ten
where
shall
we
then
place
the
beginning
of
the
series
besides
sir
the
very
prejudices
and
manners
of
society
which
seem
to
be
an
excuse
for
the
present
negligence
in
the
early
education
of
children
act
upon
my
mind
with
a
contrary
effect
need
we
fear
that
after
every
possible
precaution
has
been
taken
our
pupil
should
not
give
a
sufficient
loose
to
his
passions
or
should
be
in
danger
of
being
too
severely
virtuous
how
glorious
would
be
such
a
distinction
how
much
to
be
wished
for
and
yet
how
little
to
be
expected
by
any
one
who
is
moderately
acquainted
with
the
world
the
instant
he
makes
his
entrance
there
he
will
find
a
universal
relaxation
and
indifference
to
everything
that
is
serious
everything
will
conspire
to
represent
pleasure
and
sensuality
as
the
only
business
of
human
beings
and
to
throw
a
ridicule
upon
every
pretence
to
principle
or
restraint
this
will
be
the
doctrine
that
he
will
learn
at
theatres
from
his
companions
from
the
polite
circles
into
which
he
is
introduced
the
ladies
too
will
have
their
share
in
the
improvement
of
his
character
they
will
criticise
the
colour
of
his
clothes
his
method
of
making
a
bow
and
of
entering
a
room
they
will
teach
him
that
the
great
object
of
human
life
is
to
please
the
fair
and
that
the
only
method
of
doing
it
is
to
acquire
the
graces
need
we
fear
that
thus
beset
an
every
side
he
should
not
attach
a
sufficient
importance
to
trifles
or
grow
fashionably
languid
in
the
discharge
of
all
his
duties
alas
sir
it
seems
to
me
that
this
will
unavoidably
happen
in
spite
of
all
our
endeavours
let
us
then
not
lose
the
important
moment
of
human
life
when
it
is
possible
to
flatter
ourselves
with
some
hopes
of
success
in
giving
good
impressions
they
may
succeed
they
may
either
preserve
a
young
man
from
gross
immorality
or
have
a
tendency
to
reform
him
when
the
first
ardour
of
youth
is
past
if
we
neglect
this
awful
moment
which
can
never
return
with
the
view
which
i
must
confess
i
have
of
modern
manners
it
appears
to
me
like
launching
a
vessel
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
without
a
compass
and
without
a
pilot
sir
said
mr
merton
i
will
make
no
other
answer
to
what
you
have
now
been
saying
than
to
tell
you
it
adds
if
possible
to
my
esteem
of
your
character
and
that
i
will
deliver
my
son
into
your
hands
upon
your
own
conditions
and
as
to
the
terms
pardon
me
replied
mr
barlow
if
i
interrupt
you
here
and
give
you
another
specimen
of
the
singularity
of
my
opinions
i
am
contented
to
take
your
son
for
some
months
under
my
care
and
to
endeavour
by
every
means
within
my
power
to
improve
him
but
there
is
one
circumstance
which
is
indispensable
that
you
permit
me
to
have
the
pleasure
of
serving
you
as
a
friend
if
you
approve
of
my
ideas
and
conduct
i
will
keep
him
as
long
as
you
desire
in
the
mean
time
as
there
are
i
fear
some
little
circumstances
which
have
grown
up
by
too
much
tenderness
and
indulgence
to
be
altered
in
his
character
i
think
that
i
shall
possess
more
of
the
necessary
influence
and
authority
if
i
for
the
present
appear
to
him
and
your
whole
family
rather
in
the
light
of
a
friend
than
that
of
a
schoolmaster
however
disagreeable
this
proposal
was
to
the
generosity
of
mr
merton
he
was
obliged
to
consent
to
it
and
little
tommy
was
accordingly
sent
the
next
day
to
the
vicarage
which
was
at
the
distance
of
about
two
miles
from
his
father
house
the
day
after
tommy
came
to
mr
barlow
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
he
took
him
and
harry
into
the
garden
when
he
was
there
he
took
a
spade
into
his
own
hand
and
giving
harry
a
hoe
they
both
began
to
work
with
great
eagerness
everybody
that
eats
says
mr
barlow
ought
to
assist
in
procuring
food
and
therefore
little
harry
and
i
begin
our
daily
work
this
is
my
bed
and
that
other
is
his
we
work
upon
it
every
day
and
he
that
raises
the
most
out
of
it
will
deserve
to
fare
the
best
now
tommy
if
you
choose
to
join
us
i
will
mark
you
out
a
piece
of
ground
which
you
shall
have
to
yourself
and
all
the
produce
shall
be
your
own
no
indeed
said
tommy
very
sulkily
i
am
a
gentleman
and
do
choose
to
slave
like
a
ploughboy
just
as
you
please
mr
gentleman
said
mr
barlow
but
harry
and
i
who
are
not
above
being
useful
will
mind
our
work
in
about
two
hours
mr
barlow
said
it
was
time
to
leave
off
and
taking
harry
by
the
hand
he
led
him
into
a
very
pleasant
where
they
sat
down
and
mr
barlow
taking
out
a
plate
of
very
fine
ripe
cherries
divided
them
between
harry
and
himself
tommy
who
had
followed
and
expected
his
share
when
he
saw
them
both
eating
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
could
no
longer
restrain
his
passion
but
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
sobbing
and
crying
what
is
the
matter
said
mr
barlow
very
coolly
to
him
tommy
looked
upon
him
very
sulkily
but
returned
no
answer
oh
sir
if
you
do
choose
to
give
me
an
answer
you
may
be
silent
nobody
is
obliged
to
speak
here
tommy
became
still
more
disconcerted
at
this
and
being
unable
to
conceal
his
anger
ran
out
of
the
and
wandered
very
disconsolately
about
the
garden
equally
surprised
and
vexed
to
find
that
he
was
now
in
a
place
where
nobody
felt
any
concern
whether
he
was
pleased
or
the
contrary
when
all
the
cherries
were
eaten
little
harry
said
you
promised
to
be
so
good
as
to
hear
me
read
when
we
had
done
working
in
the
garden
and
if
it
is
agreeable
to
you
i
will
now
read
the
story
of
the
and
the
ants
with
all
my
heart
said
mr
barlow
remember
to
read
it
slowly
and
distinctly
without
hesitating
or
pronouncing
the
words
wrong
and
be
sure
to
read
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
that
you
understand
it
harry
then
took
up
the
book
and
read
as
follows
the
flies
and
the
ants
in
the
corner
of
a
farmer
garden
there
once
happened
to
be
a
nest
of
ants
who
during
the
fine
weather
of
the
summer
were
employed
all
day
long
in
drawing
little
seeds
and
grains
of
corn
into
their
hole
near
them
there
happened
to
be
a
bed
of
flowers
upon
which
a
great
quantity
of
flies
used
to
be
always
sporting
and
humming
and
diverting
themselves
by
flying
from
one
flower
to
another
a
little
boy
who
was
the
farmer
son
used
frequently
to
observe
the
different
employments
of
these
animals
and
as
he
was
very
young
and
ignorant
he
one
day
thus
expressed
himself
any
creature
be
so
simple
as
these
ants
all
day
long
they
are
working
and
toiling
instead
of
enjoying
the
fine
weather
and
diverting
themselves
like
these
flies
who
are
the
happiest
creatures
in
the
world
some
time
after
he
had
made
this
observation
the
weather
grew
extremely
cold
the
sun
was
scarcely
seen
to
shine
and
the
nights
were
chill
and
frosty
the
same
little
boy
walking
then
in
the
garden
did
not
see
a
single
ant
but
all
the
flies
lay
scattered
up
and
down
either
dead
or
dying
as
he
was
very
he
could
not
help
pitying
the
unfortunate
animals
and
asking
at
the
same
time
what
had
happened
to
the
ants
that
he
used
to
see
in
the
same
place
the
father
said
flies
are
all
dead
because
they
were
careless
animals
who
gave
themselves
no
trouble
about
laying
up
provisions
and
were
too
idle
to
work
but
the
ants
who
had
been
busy
all
the
summer
in
providing
for
their
maintenance
during
the
winter
are
all
alive
and
well
and
you
will
see
them
as
soon
as
the
warm
weather
returns
very
well
harry
said
mr
barlow
we
will
now
take
a
walk
they
accordingly
rambled
out
into
the
fields
where
mr
barlow
made
harry
take
notice
of
several
kinds
of
plants
and
told
him
the
names
and
nature
of
them
at
last
harry
who
had
observed
some
very
pretty
purple
berries
upon
a
plant
that
bore
a
purple
flower
and
grew
in
the
hedges
brought
them
to
mr
barlow
and
asked
whether
they
were
good
to
eat
it
is
very
lucky
said
mr
barlow
young
man
that
you
asked
the
question
before
you
put
them
into
your
mouth
for
had
you
tasted
them
they
would
have
given
you
violent
pains
in
your
head
and
stomach
and
perhaps
have
killed
you
as
they
grow
upon
a
plant
called
which
is
a
rank
poison
sir
said
harry
i
take
care
never
to
eat
anything
without
knowing
what
it
is
and
i
hope
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
continue
to
teach
me
i
shall
very
soon
know
the
names
and
qualities
of
all
the
herbs
which
grow
as
they
were
returning
home
harry
saw
a
very
large
bird
called
a
kite
upon
the
ground
who
seemed
to
have
something
in
its
claws
which
he
was
tearing
to
pieces
harry
who
knew
him
to
be
one
of
those
ravenous
creatures
which
prey
upon
others
ran
up
to
him
shouting
as
loud
as
he
could
and
the
bird
being
frightened
flew
away
and
left
a
chicken
behind
him
very
much
hurt
indeed
but
still
alive
look
sir
said
harry
if
that
cruel
creature
has
not
almost
killed
this
poor
chicken
see
how
he
bleeds
and
hangs
his
wings
i
will
put
him
into
my
bosom
to
recover
him
and
carry
him
home
and
he
shall
have
part
of
my
dinner
every
day
till
he
is
well
and
able
to
shift
for
himself
as
soon
as
they
came
home
the
first
care
of
little
harry
was
to
put
his
wounded
chicken
into
a
basket
with
some
fresh
straw
some
water
and
some
bread
after
that
mr
barlow
and
he
went
to
dinner
in
the
meantime
tommy
who
had
been
skulking
about
all
day
very
much
mortified
and
uneasy
came
in
and
being
very
hungry
was
going
to
sit
down
to
the
table
with
the
rest
but
mr
barlow
stopped
him
and
said
no
sir
as
you
are
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
work
we
who
are
not
so
do
not
choose
to
work
for
the
idle
upon
this
tommy
retired
into
a
corner
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
but
more
from
grief
than
passion
as
he
began
to
perceive
that
nobody
minded
his
but
little
harry
who
could
not
bear
to
see
his
friend
so
unhappy
looked
up
half
crying
into
mr
barlow
face
and
said
pray
sir
may
i
do
as
i
please
with
my
share
of
the
dinner
yes
to
be
sure
child
why
then
said
he
getting
up
i
will
give
it
all
to
poor
tommy
who
wants
it
more
than
i
do
saying
this
he
gave
it
to
him
as
he
sat
in
the
corner
and
tommy
took
it
and
thanked
him
without
ever
turning
his
eyes
from
off
the
ground
i
see
said
mr
barlow
that
though
gentlemen
are
above
being
of
any
use
themselves
they
are
not
above
taking
the
bread
that
other
people
have
been
working
hard
for
at
this
tommy
cried
still
more
bitterly
than
before
the
next
day
mr
barlow
and
harry
went
to
work
as
before
but
they
had
scarcely
begun
before
tommy
came
to
them
and
desired
that
he
might
have
a
hoe
too
which
mr
barlow
gave
him
but
as
he
had
never
before
learned
to
handle
one
he
was
very
awkward
in
the
use
of
it
and
hit
himself
several
strokes
upon
his
legs
mr
barlow
then
laid
down
his
own
spade
and
showed
him
how
to
hold
and
use
it
by
which
means
in
a
short
time
he
became
very
expert
and
worked
with
the
greatest
pleasure
when
their
work
was
over
they
retired
all
three
to
the
and
tommy
felt
the
greatest
joy
imaginable
when
the
fruit
was
produced
and
he
was
invited
to
take
his
share
which
seemed
to
him
the
most
delicious
he
had
ever
tasted
because
working
in
the
air
had
given
him
an
appetite
as
soon
as
they
had
done
eating
mr
barlow
took
up
a
book
and
asked
tommy
whether
he
would
read
them
a
story
out
of
it
but
he
looking
a
little
ashamed
said
he
had
never
learned
to
read
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
said
mr
barlow
because
you
lose
a
very
great
pleasure
then
harry
shall
read
to
you
harry
accordingly
took
up
the
book
and
read
the
following
story
the
gentleman
and
the
there
was
in
a
distant
part
of
the
world
a
rich
man
who
lived
in
a
fine
house
and
spent
his
whole
time
in
eating
drinking
sleeping
and
amusing
himself
as
he
had
a
great
many
servants
to
wait
upon
him
who
treated
him
with
the
greatest
respect
and
did
whatever
they
were
ordered
and
as
he
had
never
been
taught
the
truth
nor
accustomed
to
hear
it
he
grew
very
proud
insolent
and
capricious
imagining
that
he
had
a
right
to
command
all
the
world
and
that
the
poor
were
only
born
to
serve
and
obey
him
near
this
rich
man
house
there
lived
an
honest
and
industrious
poor
man
who
gained
his
livelihood
by
making
little
baskets
out
of
dried
reeds
which
grew
upon
a
piece
of
marshy
ground
close
to
his
cottage
but
though
he
was
obliged
to
labour
from
morning
to
night
to
earn
food
enough
to
support
him
and
though
he
seldom
fared
better
than
upon
dry
bread
or
rice
or
pulse
and
had
no
other
bed
than
the
remains
of
the
rushes
of
which
he
made
baskets
yet
was
he
always
happy
cheerful
and
contented
for
his
labour
gave
him
so
good
an
appetite
that
the
coarsest
fare
appeared
to
him
delicious
and
he
went
to
bed
so
tired
that
he
would
have
slept
soundly
even
upon
the
ground
besides
this
he
was
a
good
and
virtuous
man
humane
to
everybody
honest
in
his
dealings
always
accustomed
to
speak
the
truth
and
therefore
beloved
and
respected
by
all
his
neighbours
the
rich
man
on
the
contrary
though
he
lay
upon
the
softest
bed
yet
could
not
sleep
because
he
had
passed
the
day
in
idleness
and
though
the
nicest
dishes
were
presented
to
him
yet
could
he
not
eat
with
any
pleasure
because
he
did
not
wait
till
nature
gave
him
an
appetite
nor
use
exercise
nor
go
into
the
open
air
besides
this
as
he
was
a
great
sluggard
and
glutton
he
was
almost
always
ill
and
as
he
did
good
to
nobody
he
had
no
friends
and
even
his
servants
spoke
ill
of
him
behind
his
back
and
all
his
neighbours
whom
he
oppressed
hated
him
for
these
reasons
he
was
sullen
melancholy
and
unhappy
and
became
displeased
with
all
who
appeared
more
cheerful
than
himself
when
he
was
carried
out
in
his
palanquin
a
kind
of
bed
borne
upon
the
shoulders
of
men
he
frequently
passed
by
the
cottage
of
the
poor
who
was
always
sitting
at
the
door
and
singing
as
he
wove
the
baskets
the
rich
man
could
not
behold
this
without
anger
said
he
a
wretch
a
peasant
a
fellow
that
weaves
bulrushes
for
a
scanty
subsistence
be
always
happy
and
pleased
while
i
that
am
a
gentleman
possessed
of
riches
and
power
and
of
more
consequence
than
a
million
of
reptiles
like
him
am
always
melancholy
and
discontented
this
reflection
arose
so
often
in
his
mind
that
at
last
he
began
to
feel
the
greatest
degree
of
hatred
towards
the
poor
man
and
as
he
had
never
been
accustomed
to
conquer
his
own
passions
however
improper
or
unjust
they
might
be
he
at
last
determined
to
punish
the
for
being
happier
than
himself
with
this
wicked
design
he
one
night
gave
orders
to
his
servants
who
did
not
dare
to
disobey
him
to
set
fire
to
the
rushes
which
surrounded
the
poor
man
house
as
it
was
summer
and
the
weather
in
that
country
extremely
hot
the
fire
soon
spread
over
the
whole
marsh
and
not
only
consumed
all
the
rushes
but
soon
extended
to
the
cottage
itself
and
the
poor
was
obliged
to
run
out
almost
naked
to
save
his
life
you
may
judge
of
the
surprise
and
grief
of
the
poor
man
when
he
found
himself
entirely
deprived
of
his
subsistence
by
the
wickedness
of
his
rich
neighbour
whom
he
had
never
offended
but
as
he
was
unable
to
punish
him
for
this
injustice
he
set
out
and
walked
on
foot
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
that
country
to
whom
with
many
tears
he
told
his
pitiful
case
the
magistrate
who
was
a
good
and
just
man
immediately
ordered
the
rich
man
to
be
brought
before
him
and
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
deny
the
wickedness
of
which
he
was
accused
he
thus
spoke
to
the
poor
man
this
proud
and
wicked
man
has
been
puffed
up
with
the
opinion
of
his
own
importance
and
attempted
to
commit
the
most
scandalous
injustice
from
his
contempt
of
the
poor
i
am
willing
to
teach
him
of
how
little
value
he
is
to
anybody
and
how
vile
and
contemptible
a
creature
he
really
is
but
for
this
purpose
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
consent
to
the
plan
i
have
formed
and
go
along
with
him
to
the
place
whither
i
intend
to
send
you
both
the
poor
man
replied
never
had
much
but
the
little
i
once
had
is
now
lost
by
the
mischievous
disposition
of
this
proud
and
oppressive
man
i
am
entirely
ruined
i
have
no
means
left
in
the
world
of
procuring
myself
a
morsel
of
bread
the
next
time
i
am
hungry
therefore
i
am
ready
to
go
wherever
you
please
to
send
me
and
though
i
would
not
treat
this
man
as
he
has
treated
me
yet
should
i
rejoice
to
teach
him
more
justice
and
humanity
and
to
prevent
his
injuring
the
poor
a
second
time
the
magistrate
then
ordered
them
both
to
be
put
on
board
a
ship
and
carried
to
a
distant
country
which
was
inhabited
by
a
rude
and
savage
kind
of
men
who
lived
in
huts
were
strangers
to
riches
and
got
their
living
by
fishing
as
soon
as
they
were
set
on
shore
the
sailors
left
them
as
they
had
been
ordered
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
came
round
them
in
great
numbers
the
rich
man
seeing
himself
thus
exposed
without
assistance
or
defence
in
the
midst
of
a
barbarous
people
whose
language
he
did
not
understand
and
in
whose
power
he
was
began
to
cry
and
wring
his
hands
in
the
most
abject
manner
but
the
poor
who
had
always
been
accustomed
to
hardships
and
dangers
from
his
infancy
made
signs
to
the
people
that
he
was
their
friend
and
was
willing
to
work
for
them
and
be
their
servant
upon
this
the
natives
made
signs
to
them
that
they
would
do
them
no
hurt
but
would
make
use
of
their
assistance
in
fishing
and
carrying
wood
accordingly
they
led
them
both
to
a
wood
at
some
distance
and
showing
them
several
logs
ordered
them
to
transport
them
to
their
cabins
they
both
immediately
set
about
their
tasks
and
the
poor
man
who
was
strong
and
active
very
soon
had
finished
his
share
while
the
rich
man
whose
limbs
were
tender
and
delicate
and
never
accustomed
to
any
kind
of
labour
had
scarcely
done
a
quarter
as
much
the
savages
who
were
witnesses
to
this
began
to
think
that
the
would
prove
very
useful
to
them
and
therefore
presented
him
with
a
large
portion
of
fish
and
several
of
their
choicest
roots
while
to
the
rich
man
they
gave
scarcely
enough
to
support
him
because
they
thought
him
capable
of
being
of
very
little
service
to
them
however
as
he
had
now
fasted
several
hours
he
ate
what
they
gave
him
with
a
better
appetite
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
at
his
own
table
the
next
day
they
were
set
to
work
again
and
as
the
had
the
same
advantage
over
his
companion
he
was
highly
caressed
and
well
treated
by
the
natives
while
they
showed
every
mark
of
contempt
towards
the
other
whose
delicate
and
luxurious
habits
had
rendered
him
very
unfit
for
labour
the
rich
man
now
began
to
perceive
with
how
little
reason
he
had
before
valued
himself
and
despised
his
and
an
accident
that
fell
out
shortly
after
tended
to
complete
his
mortification
it
happened
that
one
of
the
savages
had
found
something
like
a
fillet
with
which
he
adorned
his
forehead
and
seemed
to
think
himself
extremely
fine
the
who
had
perceived
this
appearance
of
vanity
pulled
up
some
reeds
and
sitting
down
to
work
in
a
short
time
finished
a
very
elegant
wreath
which
he
placed
upon
the
head
of
the
first
inhabitant
he
chanced
to
meet
this
man
was
so
pleased
with
his
new
acquisition
that
he
danced
and
capered
with
joy
and
ran
away
to
seek
the
rest
who
were
all
struck
with
astonishment
at
this
new
and
elegant
piece
of
finery
it
was
not
long
before
another
came
to
the
making
signs
that
he
wanted
to
be
ornamented
like
his
companion
and
with
such
pleasure
were
these
chaplets
considered
by
the
whole
nation
that
the
was
released
from
his
former
drudgery
and
continually
employed
in
weaving
them
in
return
for
the
pleasure
which
he
conferred
upon
them
the
grateful
savages
brought
him
every
kind
of
food
their
country
afforded
built
him
a
hut
and
showed
him
every
demonstration
of
gratitude
and
kindness
but
the
rich
man
who
possessed
neither
talents
to
please
nor
strength
to
labour
was
condemned
to
be
the
servant
and
to
cut
him
reeds
to
supply
the
continual
demand
for
chaplets
after
having
passed
some
months
in
this
manner
they
were
again
transported
to
their
own
country
by
the
orders
of
the
magistrate
and
brought
before
him
he
then
looked
sternly
upon
the
rich
man
and
said
now
taught
you
how
helpless
contemptible
and
feeble
a
creature
you
are
as
well
as
how
inferior
to
the
man
you
insulted
i
shall
proceed
to
make
reparation
to
him
for
the
injury
you
have
inflicted
upon
him
did
i
treat
you
as
you
deserve
i
should
take
from
you
all
the
riches
that
you
possess
as
you
wantonly
deprived
this
poor
man
of
his
whole
subsistence
but
hoping
that
you
will
become
more
humane
for
the
future
i
sentence
you
to
give
half
your
fortune
to
this
man
whom
you
endeavoured
to
ruin
upon
this
the
said
after
thanking
the
magistrate
for
his
goodness
having
been
bred
up
in
poverty
and
accustomed
to
labour
have
no
desire
to
acquire
riches
which
i
should
not
know
how
to
use
all
therefore
that
i
require
of
this
man
is
to
put
me
into
the
same
situation
i
was
in
before
and
to
learn
more
humanity
the
rich
man
could
not
help
being
astonished
at
this
generosity
and
having
acquired
wisdom
by
his
misfortunes
not
only
treated
the
as
a
friend
during
the
rest
of
his
life
but
employed
his
riches
in
relieving
the
poor
and
benefiting
his
the
story
being
ended
tommy
said
it
was
very
pretty
but
that
had
he
been
the
good
he
would
have
taken
the
naughty
rich
fortune
and
kept
it
so
would
not
i
said
harry
for
fear
of
growing
as
proud
and
wicked
and
idle
as
the
other
from
this
time
forward
mr
barlow
and
his
two
pupils
used
constantly
to
work
in
their
garden
every
morning
and
when
they
were
fatigued
they
retired
to
the
where
little
harry
who
improved
every
day
in
reading
used
to
entertain
them
with
some
pleasant
story
or
other
which
tommy
always
listened
to
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
little
harry
going
home
for
a
week
tommy
and
mr
barlow
were
left
alone
the
next
day
after
they
had
done
work
and
retired
to
the
as
usual
tommy
expected
mr
barlow
would
read
to
him
but
to
his
great
disappointment
found
that
he
was
busy
and
could
not
the
next
day
the
same
accident
was
renewed
and
the
day
after
that
at
this
tommy
lost
all
patience
and
said
to
himself
now
if
i
could
but
read
like
little
harry
sandford
i
should
not
need
to
ask
anybody
to
do
it
for
me
and
then
i
could
divert
myself
and
why
thinks
he
may
not
i
do
what
another
has
done
to
be
sure
little
harry
is
clever
but
he
could
not
have
read
if
he
had
not
been
taught
and
if
i
am
taught
i
dare
say
i
shall
learn
to
read
as
well
as
he
well
as
soon
as
ever
he
comes
home
i
am
determined
to
ask
him
about
it
the
next
day
little
harry
returned
and
as
soon
as
tommy
had
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
him
pray
harry
said
tommy
how
came
you
to
be
able
to
read
why
mr
barlow
taught
me
my
letters
and
then
spelling
and
then
by
putting
syllables
together
i
learnt
to
read
and
could
not
you
show
me
my
letters
yes
very
willingly
harry
then
took
up
a
book
and
tommy
was
so
eager
and
attentive
that
at
the
very
first
lesson
he
learned
the
whole
alphabet
he
was
infinitely
pleased
with
this
first
experiment
and
could
scarcely
forbear
running
to
mr
barlow
to
let
him
know
the
improvement
he
had
made
but
he
thought
he
should
surprise
him
more
if
he
said
nothing
about
the
matter
till
he
was
able
to
read
a
whole
story
he
therefore
applied
himself
with
such
diligence
and
little
harry
who
spared
no
pains
to
assist
his
friend
was
so
good
a
master
that
in
about
two
months
he
determined
to
surprise
mr
barlow
with
a
display
of
his
talents
accordingly
one
day
when
they
were
all
assembled
in
the
and
the
book
was
given
to
harry
tommy
stood
up
and
said
that
if
mr
barlow
pleased
he
would
try
to
read
oh
very
willingly
said
mr
barlow
but
i
should
as
soon
expect
you
to
fly
as
to
read
tommy
smiled
with
a
consciousness
of
his
own
proficiency
and
taking
up
the
book
read
with
great
fluency
the
history
of
the
two
dogs
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
there
are
many
strong
and
fierce
wild
beasts
a
poor
man
happened
to
bring
up
two
puppies
of
that
kind
which
is
most
valued
for
size
and
courage
as
they
appeared
to
possess
more
than
common
strength
and
agility
he
thought
that
he
should
make
an
acceptable
present
to
his
landlord
who
was
a
rich
man
living
in
a
great
city
by
giving
him
one
of
them
which
was
called
jowler
while
he
brought
up
the
other
named
keeper
to
guard
his
own
flocks
from
this
time
the
manner
of
living
was
entirely
altered
between
the
brother
whelps
jowler
was
sent
into
a
plentiful
kitchen
where
he
quickly
became
the
favourite
of
the
servants
who
diverted
themselves
with
his
little
tricks
and
wanton
gambols
and
rewarded
him
with
great
quantities
of
and
broken
victuals
by
which
means
as
he
was
stuffing
from
morning
to
night
he
increased
considerably
in
size
and
grew
sleek
and
comely
he
was
indeed
rather
unwieldy
and
so
cowardly
that
he
would
run
away
from
a
dog
only
half
as
big
as
himself
he
was
much
addicted
to
gluttony
and
was
often
beaten
for
the
thefts
he
committed
in
the
pantry
but
as
he
had
learned
to
fawn
upon
the
footmen
and
would
stand
upon
his
hind
legs
to
beg
when
he
was
ordered
and
besides
this
would
fetch
and
carry
he
was
mightily
caressed
by
all
the
neighbourhood
keeper
in
the
meantime
who
lived
at
a
cottage
in
the
country
neither
fared
so
well
looked
so
plump
nor
had
learned
all
these
little
tricks
to
recommend
him
but
as
his
master
was
too
poor
to
maintain
anything
but
what
was
useful
and
was
obliged
to
be
continually
in
the
air
subject
to
all
kinds
of
weather
and
labouring
hard
for
a
livelihood
keeper
grew
hardy
active
and
diligent
he
was
also
exposed
to
continual
danger
from
the
wolves
from
whom
he
had
received
many
a
severe
bite
while
guarding
the
flocks
these
continual
combats
gave
him
that
degree
of
intrepidity
that
no
enemy
could
make
him
turn
his
back
his
care
and
assiduity
so
well
defended
the
sheep
of
his
master
that
not
one
had
ever
been
missing
since
they
were
placed
under
his
protection
his
honesty
too
was
so
great
that
no
temptation
could
overpower
it
and
though
he
was
left
alone
in
the
kitchen
while
the
meat
was
roasting
he
never
attempted
to
taste
it
but
received
with
thankfulness
whatever
his
master
chose
to
give
him
from
a
continual
life
in
the
air
he
was
become
so
hardy
that
no
tempest
could
drive
him
to
shelter
when
he
ought
to
be
watching
the
flocks
and
he
would
plunge
into
the
most
rapid
river
in
the
coldest
weather
of
the
winter
at
the
slightest
sign
from
his
master
about
this
time
it
happened
that
the
landlord
of
the
poor
man
went
to
examine
his
estate
in
the
country
and
brought
jowler
with
him
to
the
place
of
his
birth
at
his
arrival
there
he
could
not
help
viewing
with
great
contempt
the
rough
ragged
appearance
of
keeper
and
his
awkward
look
which
discovered
nothing
of
the
address
for
which
he
so
much
admired
jowler
this
opinion
however
was
altered
by
means
of
an
accident
which
happened
to
him
as
he
was
one
day
walking
in
a
thick
wood
with
no
other
company
than
the
two
dogs
a
hungry
wolf
with
eyes
that
sparkled
like
fire
bristling
hair
and
a
horrid
snarl
that
made
the
gentleman
tremble
rushed
out
of
a
neighbouring
thicket
and
seemed
ready
to
devour
him
the
unfortunate
man
gave
himself
over
for
lost
more
especially
when
he
saw
that
his
faithful
jowler
instead
of
coming
to
his
assistance
ran
sneaking
away
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
howling
with
fear
but
in
this
moment
of
despair
the
undaunted
keeper
who
had
followed
him
humbly
and
unobserved
at
a
distance
flew
to
his
assistance
and
attacked
the
wolf
with
so
much
courage
and
skill
that
he
was
compelled
to
exert
all
his
strength
in
his
own
defence
the
battle
was
long
and
bloody
but
in
the
end
keeper
laid
the
wolf
dead
at
his
feet
though
not
without
receiving
several
severe
wounds
himself
and
presenting
a
bloody
and
mangled
spectacle
to
the
eyes
of
his
master
who
came
up
at
that
instant
the
gentleman
was
filled
with
joy
for
his
escape
and
gratitude
to
his
brave
deliverer
and
learned
by
his
own
experience
that
appearances
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
and
that
great
virtues
and
good
dispositions
may
sometimes
be
found
in
cottagers
while
they
are
totally
wanting
among
the
great
very
well
indeed
said
mr
barlow
i
find
that
when
young
gentlemen
choose
to
take
pains
they
can
do
things
almost
as
well
as
other
people
but
what
do
you
say
to
the
story
you
have
been
reading
tommy
would
you
rather
have
owned
the
genteel
dog
that
left
his
master
to
be
devoured
or
the
poor
rough
ragged
meagre
neglected
cur
that
exposed
his
own
life
in
his
defence
indeed
sir
said
tommy
i
would
have
rather
had
keeper
but
then
i
would
have
fed
him
and
washed
him
and
combed
him
till
he
had
looked
as
well
as
jowler
but
then
perhaps
he
would
have
grown
idle
and
fat
and
cowardly
like
him
said
mr
barlow
but
here
is
some
more
of
it
let
us
read
to
the
end
of
the
story
tommy
then
went
on
thus
the
gentleman
was
so
pleased
with
the
noble
behaviour
of
keeper
that
he
desired
the
poor
man
to
make
him
a
present
of
the
dog
which
though
with
some
reluctance
he
complied
with
keeper
was
therefore
taken
to
the
city
where
he
was
caressed
and
fed
by
everybody
and
the
disgraced
jowler
was
left
at
the
cottage
with
strict
injunctions
to
the
man
to
hang
him
up
as
a
worthless
unprofitable
cur
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
had
departed
the
poor
man
was
going
to
execute
his
commission
but
considering
the
noble
size
and
comely
look
of
the
dog
and
above
all
being
moved
with
pity
for
the
poor
animal
who
wagged
his
tail
and
licked
his
new
master
feet
just
as
he
was
putting
the
cord
about
his
neck
he
determined
to
spare
his
life
and
see
whether
a
different
treatment
might
not
produce
different
manners
from
this
day
jowler
was
in
every
respect
treated
as
his
brother
keeper
had
been
before
he
was
fed
but
scantily
and
from
this
spare
diet
soon
grew
more
active
and
fond
of
exercise
the
first
shower
he
was
in
he
ran
away
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
and
sneaked
to
the
but
the
farmer
wife
soon
drove
him
out
of
doors
and
compelled
him
to
bear
the
rigour
of
the
weather
in
consequence
of
this
he
daily
became
more
vigorous
and
hardy
and
in
a
few
months
regarded
cold
and
rain
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
brought
up
in
the
country
changed
as
he
already
was
in
many
respects
for
the
better
he
still
retained
an
insurmountable
dread
of
wild
beasts
till
one
day
as
he
was
wandering
through
a
wood
alone
he
was
attacked
by
a
large
and
fierce
wolf
who
jumping
out
of
a
thicket
seized
him
by
the
neck
with
fury
jowler
would
fain
have
run
but
his
enemy
was
too
swift
and
violent
to
suffer
him
to
escape
necessity
makes
even
cowards
brave
jowler
being
thus
stopped
in
his
retreat
turned
upon
his
enemy
and
very
luckily
seizing
him
by
the
throat
strangled
him
in
an
instant
his
master
then
coming
up
and
being
witness
of
his
exploit
praised
him
and
stroked
him
with
a
degree
of
fondness
he
had
never
done
before
animated
by
this
victory
and
by
the
approbation
of
his
master
jowler
from
that
time
became
as
brave
as
he
had
before
been
pusillanimous
and
there
was
very
soon
no
dog
in
the
country
who
was
so
great
a
terror
to
beasts
of
prey
in
the
mean
time
keeper
instead
of
hunting
wild
beasts
or
looking
after
sheep
did
nothing
but
eat
and
sleep
which
he
was
permitted
to
do
from
a
remembrance
of
his
past
services
as
all
qualities
both
of
mind
and
body
are
lost
if
not
continually
exercised
he
soon
ceased
to
be
that
hardy
courageous
animal
he
was
before
and
acquired
all
the
faults
which
are
the
consequences
of
idleness
and
gluttony
about
this
time
the
gentleman
went
again
into
the
country
and
taking
his
dog
with
him
was
willing
that
he
should
exercise
his
prowess
once
more
against
his
ancient
enemies
the
wolves
accordingly
the
country
people
having
quickly
found
one
in
a
neighbouring
wood
the
gentleman
went
thither
with
keeper
expecting
to
see
him
behave
as
he
had
done
the
year
before
but
how
great
was
his
surprise
when
at
the
first
onset
he
saw
his
beloved
dog
run
away
with
every
mark
of
timidity
at
this
moment
another
dog
sprang
forward
and
seizing
the
wolf
with
the
greatest
intrepidity
after
a
bloody
contest
left
him
dead
upon
the
ground
the
gentleman
could
not
help
lamenting
the
cowardice
of
his
favourite
and
admiring
the
noble
spirit
of
the
other
dog
whom
to
his
infinite
surprise
he
found
to
be
the
same
jowler
that
he
had
discarded
the
year
before
now
see
said
he
to
the
farmer
it
is
in
vain
to
expect
courage
in
those
who
live
a
life
of
indolence
and
repose
and
that
constant
exercise
and
proper
discipline
are
frequently
able
to
change
contemptible
characters
into
good
ones
indeed
said
mr
barlow
when
the
story
was
ended
i
am
sincerely
glad
to
find
that
tommy
has
made
this
acquisition
he
will
now
depend
upon
nobody
but
be
able
to
divert
himself
whenever
he
pleases
all
that
has
ever
been
written
in
our
own
language
will
be
from
this
time
in
his
power
whether
he
chooses
to
read
little
entertaining
stories
like
what
we
have
heard
or
to
read
the
actions
of
great
and
good
men
in
history
or
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
wild
beasts
and
birds
which
are
found
in
other
countries
and
have
been
described
in
books
in
short
i
scarcely
know
of
anything
which
from
this
moment
will
not
be
in
his
power
and
i
do
not
despair
of
one
day
seeing
him
a
very
sensible
man
capable
of
teaching
and
instructing
others
yes
said
tommy
something
elated
by
all
this
praise
i
am
determined
to
make
myself
as
clever
as
anybody
and
i
do
doubt
though
i
am
such
a
little
fellow
that
i
know
more
already
than
many
people
and
i
am
sure
though
there
are
no
less
than
six
blacks
in
our
house
that
there
is
not
one
of
them
who
can
read
a
story
like
me
mr
barlow
looked
a
little
grave
at
this
sudden
display
of
vanity
and
said
rather
coolly
pray
who
has
attempted
to
teach
them
anything
nobody
i
believe
said
tommy
where
is
the
great
wonder
then
if
they
are
ignorant
replied
mr
barlow
you
would
probably
have
never
known
anything
had
you
not
been
assisted
and
even
now
you
know
very
little
chapter
ii
tommy
and
the
ragged
boy
story
of
androcles
and
the
lion
conversation
on
slavery
conversation
about
an
ass
present
and
its
consequences
the
story
of
cyrus
squire
chase

saves
the
squire
life
making
bread
story
of
the
two
brothers
story
of
the
sailors
on
the
island
of
spitzbergen
in
this
manner
did
mr
barlow
begin
the
education
of
tommy
merton
who
had
naturally
very
good
dispositions
although
he
had
been
suffered
to
acquire
many
bad
habits
that
sometimes
prevented
them
from
appearing
he
was
in
particular
very
passionate
and
thought
he
had
a
right
to
command
everybody
that
was
not
dressed
as
fine
as
himself
this
opinion
often
led
him
into
inconveniences
and
once
was
the
occasion
of
his
being
severely
mortified
this
accident
happened
in
the
following
manner
one
day
as
tommy
was
striking
a
ball
with
his
bat
he
struck
it
over
a
hedge
into
an
adjoining
field
and
seeing
a
little
ragged
boy
walking
along
on
that
side
he
ordered
him
in
a
very
peremptory
tone
to
bring
it
to
him
the
little
boy
without
taking
any
notice
of
what
was
said
walked
on
and
left
the
ball
upon
which
tommy
called
out
more
loudly
than
before
and
asked
if
he
did
not
hear
what
was
said
yes
said
the
boy
for
the
matter
of
that
i
am
not
deaf
oh
you
are
not
replied
tommy
then
bring
me
my
ball
directly
i
do
choose
it
said
the
boy
sirrah
said
tommy
if
i
come
to
you
i
shall
make
you
choose
it
perhaps
not
my
pretty
little
master
said
the
boy
you
little
rascal
said
tommy
who
now
began
to
be
very
angry
if
i
come
over
the
hedge
i
will
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
to
this
the
other
made
no
answer
but
by
a
loud
laugh
which
provoked
tommy
so
much
that
he
clambered
over
the
hedge
and
jumped
precipitately
down
intending
to
have
leaped
into
the
field
but
unfortunately
his
foot
slipped
and
down
he
rolled
into
a
wet
ditch
which
was
full
of
mud
and
water
there
poor
tommy
tumbled
about
for
some
time
endeavouring
to
get
out
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
for
his
feet
stuck
in
the
mud
or
slipped
off
from
the
bank
his
fine
waistcoat
was
dirtied
all
over
his
white
stockings
covered
with
mire
his
breeches
filled
with
puddle
water
and
to
add
to
his
distress
he
first
lost
one
shoe
and
then
the
other
his
laced
hat
tumbled
off
from
his
head
and
was
completely
spoiled
in
this
distress
he
must
probably
have
remained
a
considerable
time
had
not
the
little
ragged
boy
taken
pity
on
him
and
helped
him
out
tommy
was
so
vexed
and
ashamed
that
he
could
not
say
a
word
but
ran
home
in
such
a
plight
that
mr
barlow
who
happened
to
meet
him
was
afraid
he
had
been
considerably
hurt
but
when
he
heard
the
accident
which
had
happened
he
could
not
help
smiling
and
he
advised
tommy
to
be
more
careful
for
the
future
how
he
attempted
to
thrash
little
ragged
boys
the
next
day
mr
barlow
desired
harry
when
they
were
all
together
in
the
arbour
to
read
the
following
story
of
androcles
and
the
lion
there
was
a
certain
slave
named
androcles
who
was
so
ill
treated
by
his
master
that
his
life
became
insupportable
finding
no
remedy
for
what
he
suffered
he
at
length
said
to
himself
is
better
to
die
than
to
continue
to
live
in
such
hardships
and
misery
as
i
am
obliged
to
suffer
i
am
determined
therefore
to
run
away
from
my
master
if
i
am
taken
again
i
know
that
i
shall
be
punished
with
a
cruel
death
but
it
is
better
to
die
at
once
than
to
live
in
misery
if
i
escape
i
must
betake
myself
to
deserts
and
woods
inhabited
only
by
beasts
but
they
can
not
use
me
more
cruelly
than
i
have
been
used
by
my
therefore
i
will
rather
trust
myself
with
them
than
continue
to
be
a
miserable
slave
having
formed
this
resolution
he
took
an
opportunity
of
leaving
his
master
house
and
hid
himself
in
a
thick
forest
which
was
at
some
miles
distance
from
the
city
but
here
the
unhappy
man
found
that
he
had
only
escaped
from
one
kind
of
misery
to
experience
another
he
wandered
about
all
day
through
a
vast
and
trackless
wood
where
his
flesh
was
continually
torn
by
thorns
and
brambles
he
grew
hungry
but
could
find
no
food
in
this
dreary
solitude
at
length
he
was
ready
to
die
with
fatigue
and
lay
down
in
despair
in
a
large
cavern
which
he
found
by
accident
poor
man
said
harry
whose
little
heart
could
scarcely
contain
itself
at
this
mournful
recital
i
wish
i
could
have
met
with
him
i
would
have
given
him
all
my
dinner
and
he
should
have
had
my
bed
but
pray
sir
tell
me
why
does
one
man
behave
so
cruelly
to
another
and
why
should
one
person
be
the
servant
of
another
and
bear
so
much
ill
treatment
as
to
that
said
tommy
some
folks
are
born
gentlemen
and
then
they
must
command
others
and
some
are
born
servants
and
then
they
must
do
as
they
are
bid
i
remember
before
i
came
hither
that
there
were
a
great
many
black
men
and
women
that
my
mother
said
were
only
born
to
wait
upon
me
and
i
used
to
beat
them
and
kick
them
and
throw
things
at
them
whenever
i
was
angry
and
they
never
dared
strike
me
again
because
they
were
slaves
and
pray
young
man
said
mr
barlow
how
came
these
people
to
be
slaves
because
my
father
bought
them
with
his
money
so
then
people
that
are
bought
with
money
are
slaves
are
they
yes
and
those
that
buy
them
have
a
right
to
kick
them
and
beat
them
and
do
as
they
please
with
them
yes
then
if
i
was
to
take
and
sell
you
to
farmer
sandford
he
would
have
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
you
no
sir
said
tommy
somewhat
warmly
but
you
would
have
no
right
to
sell
me
nor
he
to
buy
me
then
it
is
not
a
person
being
bought
or
sold
that
gives
another
a
right
to
use
him
ill
but
one
person
having
a
right
to
sell
another
and
the
man
who
buys
having
a
right
to
purchase
yes
sir
and
what
right
have
the
people
who
sold
the
poor
negroes
to
your
father
to
sell
them
or
what
right
has
your
father
to
buy
them
here
tommy
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
puzzled
but
at
length
he
said
they
are
brought
from
a
country
that
is
a
great
way
off
in
ships
and
so
they
become
slaves
then
said
mr
barlow
if
i
take
you
to
another
country
in
a
ship
i
shall
have
a
right
to
sell
you
no
but
you
wo
sir
because
i
was
born
a
gentleman
what
do
you
mean
by
that
tommy
why
said
tommy
a
little
confounded
to
have
a
fine
house
and
fine
clothes
and
a
coach
and
a
great
deal
of
money
as
my
papa
has
then
if
you
were
no
longer
to
have
a
fine
house
nor
fine
clothes
nor
a
great
deal
of
money
somebody
that
had
all
these
things
might
make
you
a
slave
and
use
you
ill
and
beat
you
and
insult
you
and
do
whatever
he
liked
with
you
no
sir
that
would
not
be
right
neither
that
anybody
should
use
me
then
one
person
should
not
use
another
ill
no
sir
to
make
a
slave
of
anybody
is
to
use
him
ill
is
it
not
i
think
so
then
no
one
ought
to
make
a
slave
of
you
no
indeed
sir
but
if
no
one
should
use
another
ill
and
making
a
slave
is
using
him
ill
neither
ought
you
to
make
a
slave
of
any
one
else
indeed
sir
i
think
not
and
for
the
future
i
never
will
use
our
black
william
ill
nor
pinch
him
nor
kick
him
as
i
used
to
do
then
you
will
be
a
very
good
boy
but
let
us
now
continue
our
story
this
unfortunate
man
had
not
lain
long
quiet
in
the
cavern
before
he
heard
a
dreadful
noise
which
seemed
to
be
the
roar
of
some
wild
beast
and
terrified
him
very
much
he
started
up
with
a
design
to
escape
and
had
already
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cave
when
he
saw
coming
towards
him
a
lion
of
prodigious
size
who
prevented
any
possibility
of
retreat
the
unfortunate
man
now
believed
his
destruction
to
be
inevitable
but
to
his
great
astonishment
the
beast
advanced
towards
him
with
a
gentle
pace
without
any
mark
of
enmity
or
rage
and
uttered
a
kind
of
mournful
voice
as
if
he
demanded
the
assistance
of
the
man
androcles
who
was
naturally
of
a
resolute
disposition
acquired
courage
from
this
circumstance
to
examine
his
monstrous
guest
who
gave
him
sufficient
leisure
for
that
purpose
he
saw
as
the
lion
approached
him
that
he
seemed
to
limp
upon
one
of
his
legs
and
that
the
foot
was
extremely
swelled
as
if
it
had
been
wounded
acquiring
still
more
fortitude
from
the
gentle
demeanour
of
the
beast
he
advanced
up
to
him
and
took
hold
of
the
wounded
paw
as
a
surgeon
would
examine
a
patient
he
then
perceived
that
a
thorn
of
uncommon
size
had
penetrated
the
ball
of
the
foot
and
was
the
occasion
of
the
swelling
and
lameness
which
he
had
observed
androcles
found
that
the
beast
far
from
resenting
this
familiarity
received
it
with
the
greatest
gentleness
and
seemed
to
invite
him
by
his
blandishments
to
proceed
he
therefore
extracted
the
thorn
and
pressing
the
swelling
discharged
a
considerable
quantity
of
matter
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
pain
and
uneasiness
as
soon
as
the
beast
felt
himself
thus
relieved
he
began
to
testify
his
joy
and
gratitude
by
every
expression
within
his
power
he
jumped
about
like
a
wanton
spaniel
wagged
his
enormous
tail
and
licked
the
feet
and
hands
of
his
physician
nor
was
he
contented
with
these
demonstrations
of
kindness
from
this
moment
androcles
became
his
guest
nor
did
the
lion
ever
sally
forth
in
quest
of
prey
without
bringing
home
the
produce
of
his
chase
and
sharing
it
with
his
friend
in
this
savage
state
of
hospitality
did
the
man
continue
to
live
during
the
space
of
several
months
at
length
wandering
unguardedly
through
the
woods
he
met
with
a
company
of
soldiers
sent
out
to
apprehend
him
and
was
by
them
taken
prisoner
and
conducted
back
to
his
master
the
laws
of
that
country
being
very
severe
against
slaves
he
was
tried
and
found
guilty
of
having
fled
from
his
master
and
as
a
punishment
for
his
pretended
crime
he
was
sentenced
to
be
torn
in
pieces
by
a
furious
lion
kept
many
days
without
food
to
inspire
him
with
additional
rage
when
the
destined
moment
arrived
the
unhappy
man
was
exposed
unarmed
in
the
midst
of
a
spacious
area
enclosed
on
every
side
round
which
many
thousand
people
were
assembled
to
view
the
mournful
spectacle
presently
a
dreadful
yell
was
heard
which
struck
the
spectators
with
horror
and
a
monstrous
lion
rushed
out
of
a
den
which
was
purposely
set
open
and
darted
forward
with
erected
mane
and
flaming
eyes
and
jaws
that
gaped
like
an
open
sepulchre
a
mournful
silence
instantly
prevailed
all
eyes
were
directly
turned
upon
the
destined
victim
whose
destruction
now
appeared
inevitable
but
the
pity
of
the
multitude
was
soon
converted
into
astonishment
when
they
beheld
the
lion
instead
of
destroying
his
defenceless
prey
crouch
submissively
at
his
feet
fawn
upon
him
as
a
faithful
dog
would
do
upon
his
master
and
rejoice
over
him
as
a
mother
that
unexpectedly
recovers
her
offspring
the
governor
of
the
town
who
was
present
then
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
ordered
androcles
to
explain
to
them
this
unintelligible
mystery
and
how
a
savage
of
the
fiercest
and
most
unpitying
nature
should
thus
in
a
moment
have
forgotten
his
innate
disposition
and
be
converted
into
a
harmless
and
inoffensive
animal
androcles
then
related
to
the
assembly
every
circumstance
of
his
adventures
in
the
woods
and
concluded
by
saying
that
the
very
lion
which
now
stood
before
them
had
been
his
friend
and
entertainer
in
the
woods
all
the
persons
present
were
astonished
and
delighted
with
the
story
to
find
that
even
the
fiercest
beasts
are
capable
of
being
softened
by
gratitude
and
moved
by
humanity
and
they
unanimously
joined
to
entreat
for
the
pardon
of
the
unhappy
man
from
the
governor
of
the
place
this
was
immediately
granted
to
him
and
he
was
also
presented
with
the
lion
who
had
in
this
manner
twice
saved
the
life
of
androcles
upon
my
word
said
tommy
this
is
a
very
pretty
story
but
i
never
should
have
thought
that
a
lion
could
have
grown
so
tame
i
thought
that
they
and
tigers
and
wolves
had
been
so
fierce
and
cruel
that
they
would
have
torn
everything
they
met
to
pieces
when
they
are
hungry
said
mr
barlow
they
kill
every
animal
they
meet
but
this
is
to
devour
it
for
they
can
only
live
upon
flesh
like
dogs
and
cats
and
many
other
kinds
of
animals
when
they
are
not
hungry
they
seldom
meddle
with
anything
or
do
unnecessary
mischief
therefore
they
are
much
less
cruel
than
many
persons
that
i
have
seen
and
even
than
many
children
who
plague
and
torment
animals
without
any
reason
whatsoever
indeed
sir
said
harry
i
think
so
and
i
remember
as
i
was
walking
along
the
road
some
days
past
i
saw
a
little
naughty
boy
that
used
a
poor
jackass
very
ill
indeed
the
poor
animal
was
so
lame
that
he
could
hardly
stir
and
yet
the
boy
beat
him
with
a
great
stick
as
violently
as
he
was
able
to
make
him
go
on
faster
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
said
mr
barlow
why
sir
i
told
him
how
naughty
and
cruel
it
was
and
i
asked
him
how
he
would
like
to
be
beaten
in
that
manner
by
somebody
that
was
stronger
than
himself
and
what
answer
did
he
make
you
he
said
that
it
was
his
daddy
ass
and
so
that
he
had
a
right
to
beat
it
and
that
if
i
said
a
word
more
he
would
beat
me
and
what
answer
did
you
make
any
i
told
him
if
it
was
his
father
ass
he
should
not
use
it
ill
for
that
we
were
all
creatures
and
that
we
should
love
each
other
as
he
loved
us
all
and
that
as
to
beating
me
if
he
struck
me
i
had
a
right
to
strike
him
again
and
would
do
it
though
he
was
almost
as
big
again
as
i
was
and
did
he
strike
you
yes
sir
he
endeavoured
to
strike
me
upon
the
head
with
his
stick
but
i
dodged
and
so
it
fell
upon
my
shoulder
and
he
was
going
to
strike
me
again
but
i
darted
at
him
and
knocked
him
down
and
then
he
began
blubbering
and
begged
me
not
to
hurt
him
it
is
not
uncommon
for
those
who
are
most
cruel
to
be
at
the
same
time
most
cowardly
but
what
did
you
sir
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
him
but
that
as
he
had
meddled
with
me
i
would
not
let
him
rise
till
he
had
promised
not
to
hurt
the
poor
beast
any
more
which
he
did
and
then
i
let
him
go
about
his
business
you
did
very
right
said
mr
barlow
and
i
suppose
the
boy
looked
as
foolish
when
he
was
rising
as
tommy
did
the
other
day
when
the
little
ragged
boy
that
he
was
going
to
beat
helped
him
out
of
the
ditch
sir
answered
tommy
a
little
confused
i
should
not
have
attempted
to
beat
him
only
he
would
not
bring
me
my
ball
and
what
right
had
you
to
oblige
him
to
bring
your
ball
sir
he
was
a
little
ragged
boy
and
i
am
a
gentleman
so
then
every
gentleman
has
a
right
to
command
little
ragged
boys
to
be
sure
sir
then
if
your
clothes
should
wear
out
and
become
ragged
every
gentleman
will
have
a
right
to
command
you
tommy
looked
a
little
foolish
and
said
but
he
might
have
done
it
as
he
was
on
that
side
of
the
hedge
and
so
he
probably
would
have
done
if
you
had
asked
him
civilly
to
do
it
but
when
persons
speak
in
a
haughty
tone
they
will
find
few
inclined
to
serve
them
but
as
the
boy
was
poor
and
ragged
i
suppose
you
hired
him
with
money
to
fetch
your
ball
indeed
sir
i
did
not
i
neither
gave
him
anything
nor
offered
him
anything
probably
you
had
nothing
to
give
him
yes
i
had
though
i
had
all
this
money
pulling
out
several
shillings
perhaps
the
boy
was
as
rich
as
you
no
he
was
not
sir
i
am
sure
for
he
had
no
coat
and
his
waistcoat
and
breeches
were
all
tattered
and
ragged
besides
he
had
no
stockings
and
his
shoes
were
full
of
holes
so
now
i
see
what
constitutes
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
is
one
that
when
he
has
abundance
of
everything
keeps
it
all
to
himself
beats
poor
people
if
they
do
serve
him
for
nothing
and
when
they
have
done
him
the
greatest
favour
in
spite
of
his
insolence
never
feels
any
gratitude
or
does
them
any
good
in
return
i
find
that
androcles
lion
was
no
gentleman
tommy
was
so
affected
with
this
rebuke
that
he
could
hardly
contain
his
tears
and
as
he
was
really
a
boy
of
a
generous
temper
he
determined
to
give
the
little
ragged
boy
something
the
very
first
time
he
should
see
him
again
he
did
not
long
wait
for
an
opportunity
for
as
he
was
walking
out
that
very
afternoon
he
saw
him
at
some
distance
gathering
blackberries
and
going
up
to
him
he
accosted
him
thus
little
boy
i
want
to
know
why
you
are
so
ragged
have
you
no
other
clothes
no
indeed
said
the
boy
i
have
seven
brothers
and
sisters
and
they
are
all
as
ragged
as
myself
but
i
should
not
much
mind
that
if
i
could
have
my
belly
full
of
victuals
and
why
can
not
you
have
your
belly
full
of
victuals
because
daddy
ill
of
a
fever
and
ca
work
this
harvest
so
that
mammy
says
we
must
all
starve
if
god
almighty
does
not
take
care
of
us
tommy
made
no
answer
but
ran
full
speed
to
the
house
whence
he
presently
returned
loaded
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
complete
suit
of
his
own
clothes
here
little
boy
said
he
you
were
very
to
me
and
so
i
will
give
you
all
this
because
i
am
a
gentleman
and
have
many
more
tommy
did
not
wait
for
the
little
boy
acknowledgment
but
hastened
away
and
told
mr
barlow
with
an
air
of
exultation
what
he
had
done
mr
barlow
coolly
answered
you
have
done
well
in
giving
the
little
boy
clothes
because
they
are
your
own
but
what
right
have
you
to
give
away
my
loaf
of
bread
without
asking
my
consent
why
sir
i
did
it
because
the
little
boy
said
he
was
very
hungry
and
had
seven
brothers
and
sisters
and
that
his
father
was
ill
and
could
not
work
this
is
a
very
good
reason
why
you
should
give
them
what
belongs
to
yourself
but
not
why
you
should
give
them
what
is
another
what
would
you
say
if
harry
were
to
give
away
all
your
clothes
without
asking
your
leave
i
should
not
like
it
at
all
and
i
will
not
give
away
your
things
any
more
without
asking
your
leave
you
will
do
well
said
mr
barlow
and
here
is
a
little
story
you
may
read
upon
this
very
subject
the
story
of
cyrus
cyrus
was
a
little
boy
of
good
dispositions
and
humane
temper
he
was
very
fond
of
drawing
and
often
went
into
the
fields
for
the
purpose
of
taking
sketches
of
trees
houses
which
he
would
show
to
his
parents
on
one
occasion
he
had
retired
into
a
shed
at
the
back
of
his
father
house
and
was
so
much
absorbed
in
planning
something
with
his
compasses
as
not
to
be
for
a
long
time
aware
of
his
father
presence
he
had
several
masters
who
endeavoured
to
teach
him
everything
that
was
good
and
he
was
educated
with
several
little
boys
about
his
own
age
one
evening
his
father
asked
him
what
he
had
done
or
learned
that
day
said
cyrus
was
punished
for
deciding
unjustly
so
said
his
father
there
were
two
boys
one
of
whom
was
a
great
and
the
other
a
little
boy
now
it
happened
that
the
little
boy
had
a
coat
that
was
much
too
big
for
him
but
the
great
boy
had
one
that
scarcely
reached
below
his
middle
and
was
too
tight
for
him
in
every
part
upon
which
the
great
boy
proposed
to
the
little
boy
to
change
coats
with
him
then
said
he
shall
be
both
exactly
fitted
for
your
coat
is
as
much
too
big
for
you
as
mine
is
too
little
for
me
the
little
boy
would
not
consent
to
the
proposal
on
which
the
great
boy
took
his
coat
away
by
force
and
gave
his
own
to
the
little
boy
in
exchange
while
they
were
disputing
upon
this
subject
i
chanced
to
pass
by
and
they
agreed
to
make
me
judge
of
the
affair
but
i
decided
that
the
little
boy
should
keep
the
little
coat
and
the
great
boy
the
great
one
for
which
judgment
my
master
punished
me
so
said
cyrus
father
not
the
little
coat
most
proper
for
the
little
boy
and
the
large
coat
for
the
great
boy
sir
answered
cyrus
my
master
told
me
i
was
not
made
judge
to
examine
which
coat
best
fitted
either
of
the
boys
but
to
decide
whether
it
was
just
that
the
great
boy
should
take
away
the
coat
of
the
little
one
against
his
consent
and
therefore
i
decided
unjustly
and
deserved
to
be
punished
just
as
the
story
was
finished
they
were
surprised
to
see
a
little
ragged
boy
come
running
up
to
them
with
a
bundle
of
clothes
under
his
arm
his
eyes
were
black
as
if
he
had
been
severely
beaten
his
nose
was
swelled
his
shirt
was
bloody
and
his
waistcoat
did
but
just
hang
upon
his
back
so
much
was
it
torn
he
came
running
up
to
tommy
and
threw
down
the
bundle
before
him
saying
here
master
take
your
clothes
again
and
i
wish
they
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
i
pulled
you
out
of
instead
of
upon
my
back
but
i
never
will
put
such
frippery
on
again
as
long
as
i
have
breath
in
my
body
what
is
the
matter
said
mr
barlow
who
perceived
that
some
unfortunate
accident
had
happened
in
consequence
of
tommy
present
sir
answered
the
little
boy
my
little
master
here
was
going
to
beat
me
because
i
would
not
fetch
his
ball
now
as
to
the
matter
of
that
i
would
have
brought
his
ball
with
all
my
heart
if
he
had
but
asked
me
civilly
but
though
i
am
poor
i
am
not
bound
to
be
his
slave
as
they
say
black
william
is
and
so
i
would
not
upon
which
little
master
here
was
jumping
over
the
hedge
to
lick
me
but
instead
of
that
he
soused
into
the
ditch
and
there
he
lay
rolling
about
till
i
helped
him
out
and
so
he
gave
me
these
clothes
here
all
out
of
and
i
put
them
on
like
a
fool
as
i
was
for
they
are
all
made
of
silk
and
look
so
fine
that
all
the
little
boys
followed
me
and
hallooed
as
i
went
and
jack
dowset
threw
a
handful
of
dirt
at
me
and
dirtied
me
all
over
says
i
are
you
at
that
work
and
with
that
i
hit
him
a
good
thump
and
sent
him
roaring
away
but
billy
gibson
and
ned
kelly
came
up
and
said
i
looked
like
a
frenchman
and
so
we
began
fighting
and
i
beat
them
till
they
both
gave
out
but
i
do
choose
to
be
hallooed
after
wherever
i
go
and
to
look
like
a
frenchman
and
so
i
have
brought
master
his
clothes
again
mr
barlow
asked
the
little
boy
where
his
father
lived
and
he
told
him
that
his
father
lived
about
two
miles
off
across
the
common
and
at
the
end
of
runny
lane
on
which
mr
barlow
told
harry
that
he
would
send
the
poor
man
some
broth
and
victuals
if
he
would
carry
it
when
it
was
ready
that
i
will
said
harry
if
it
were
five
times
as
far
so
mr
barlow
went
into
the
house
to
give
orders
about
it
in
the
mean
time
tommy
who
had
eyed
the
little
boy
for
some
time
in
silence
said
so
my
poor
boy
you
have
been
beaten
and
hurt
till
you
are
all
over
blood
only
because
i
gave
you
my
clothes
i
am
really
very
sorry
for
it
thank
you
little
master
said
the
boy
but
it
be
helped
you
did
not
intend
me
any
hurt
i
know
and
i
am
not
such
a
chicken
as
to
mind
a
beating
so
i
wish
you
a
good
afternoon
with
all
my
heart
as
soon
as
the
little
boy
was
gone
tommy
said
i
wish
i
had
but
some
clothes
that
the
poor
boy
could
wear
for
he
seems
very
i
would
give
them
to
him
that
you
may
very
easily
have
said
harry
for
there
is
a
shop
in
the
village
hard
by
where
they
sell
all
manner
of
clothes
for
the
poor
people
and
as
you
have
money
you
may
easily
buy
some
harry
and
tommy
then
agreed
to
go
early
the
next
morning
to
buy
some
clothes
for
the
poor
children
they
accordingly
set
out
before
breakfast
and
had
proceeded
nearly
when
they
heard
the
noise
of
a
pack
of
hounds
that
seemed
to
be
running
full
cry
at
some
distance
tommy
then
asked
harry
if
he
knew
what
they
were
about
yes
said
harry
i
know
well
enough
what
they
are
about
it
is
squire
chase
and
his
dogs
worrying
a
poor
hare
but
i
wonder
they
are
not
ashamed
to
meddle
with
such
a
poor
inoffensive
creature
that
can
not
defend
itself
if
they
have
a
mind
to
hunt
why
do
they
hunt
lions
and
tigers
and
such
fierce
mischievous
creatures
as
i
have
read
they
do
in
other
countries
oh
dear
said
tommy
how
is
that
it
must
surely
be
very
dangerous
why
you
know
said
harry
the
men
are
accustomed
in
some
places
to
go
almost
naked
and
that
makes
them
so
prodigiously
nimble
that
they
can
run
like
a
deer
and
when
a
lion
or
tiger
comes
into
their
neighbourhood
and
devours
their
sheep
or
oxen
they
go
out
six
and
seven
together
armed
with
javelins
and
they
run
over
all
the
woods
and
examine
every
place
till
they
have
found
him
and
they
make
a
noise
to
provoke
him
to
attack
them
then
he
begins
roaring
and
foaming
beating
his
sides
with
his
tail
till
in
a
violent
fury
he
springs
at
the
man
that
is
nearest
to
him
oh
dear
said
tommy
he
must
certainly
be
torn
to
pieces
no
such
thing
answered
harry
he
jumps
like
a
greyhound
out
of
the
way
while
the
next
man
throws
his
javelin
at
the
lion
and
perhaps
wounds
him
in
the
side
this
enrages
him
still
more
he
springs
again
like
lightning
upon
the
man
that
wounded
him
but
this
man
avoids
him
like
the
other
and
at
last
the
poor
beast
drops
down
dead
with
the
number
of
wounds
he
has
received
oh
said
tommy
it
must
be
a
very
strange
sight
i
should
like
to
see
it
out
of
a
window
where
i
was
safe
so
should
not
i
answered
harry
for
it
must
be
a
great
pity
to
see
such
a
noble
animal
tortured
and
killed
but
they
are
obliged
to
do
it
in
their
own
defence
but
these
poor
hares
do
nobody
any
harm
excepting
the
farmers
by
eating
a
little
of
their
corn
sometimes
as
they
were
talking
in
this
manner
harry
casting
his
eyes
on
one
side
said
as
i
am
alive
there
is
the
poor
hare
skulking
along
i
hope
they
will
not
be
able
to
find
her
and
if
they
ask
me
i
will
never
tell
them
which
way
she
is
gone
presently
up
came
the
dogs
who
had
now
lost
all
scent
of
their
game
and
a
gentleman
mounted
upon
a
fine
horse
who
asked
harry
if
he
had
seen
the
hare
harry
made
no
answer
but
upon
the
gentleman
repeating
the
question
in
a
louder
tone
of
voice
he
answered
that
he
had
and
which
way
is
she
gone
said
the
gentleman
sir
i
do
choose
to
tell
you
answered
harry
after
some
hesitation
not
choose
said
the
gentleman
leaping
off
his
horse
but
i
make
you
choose
in
an
instant
and
coming
up
to
harry
who
never
moved
from
the
place
where
he
had
been
standing
began
to
lash
him
in
a
most
unmerciful
manner
with
his
whip
continually
repeating
now
you
little
rascal
do
you
choose
to
tell
me
now
to
which
harry
made
no
other
answer
than
this
if
i
would
not
tell
you
before
i
wo
now
though
you
should
kill
me
but
this
fortitude
of
harry
and
the
tears
of
tommy
who
cried
in
the
bitterest
manner
to
see
the
distress
of
his
friend
made
no
impression
on
this
barbarian
who
continued
his
brutality
till
another
gentleman
rode
up
full
speed
and
said
for
any
sake
squire
what
are
you
about
you
will
kill
the
child
if
you
do
not
take
care
and
the
little
dog
deserves
it
said
the
other
he
has
seen
the
hare
and
will
not
tell
me
which
way
she
is
gone
take
care
replied
the
gentleman
in
a
low
voice
you
do
involve
yourself
in
a
disagreeable
affair
i
know
the
other
to
be
the
son
of
a
gentleman
of
great
fortune
in
the
neighbourhood
and
then
turning
to
harry
he
said
why
my
dear
would
you
not
tell
the
gentleman
which
way
the
hare
had
gone
if
you
saw
her
because
answered
harry
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
breath
enough
to
speak
i
do
choose
to
betray
the
unfortunate
this
boy
said
the
gentleman
is
a
prodigy
and
it
is
a
happy
thing
for
you
squire
that
his
age
is
not
equal
to
his
spirit
but
you
are
always
passionate
at
this
moment
the
hounds
recovered
the
scent
and
bursting
into
a
full
cry
the
squire
mounted
his
horse
and
galloped
away
attended
by
all
his
companions
when
they
were
gone
tommy
came
up
to
harry
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
and
asked
him
how
he
did
a
little
sore
said
harry
but
that
does
not
signify
i
wish
i
had
had
a
pistol
or
a
sword
why
what
would
you
have
done
with
it
i
would
have
killed
that
man
who
treated
you
so
cruelly
that
would
have
been
wrong
tommy
for
i
am
sure
he
did
not
want
to
kill
me
indeed
if
i
had
been
a
man
he
should
not
have
used
me
so
but
it
is
all
over
now
and
we
ought
to
forgive
our
enemies
as
mr
barlow
tells
us
christ
did
and
then
perhaps
they
may
come
to
love
us
and
be
sorry
for
what
they
have
done
but
how
could
you
bear
to
be
so
severely
whipped
without
crying
out
why
crying
out
would
have
done
me
no
good
at
all
would
it
and
this
is
nothing
to
what
many
little
boys
have
suffered
without
ever
flinching
or
bemoaning
themselves
well
i
should
have
thought
a
great
deal
oh
it
nothing
to
what
the
young
spartans
used
to
suffer
who
were
they
why
you
must
know
they
were
a
very
brave
set
of
people
that
lived
a
great
while
ago
and
as
they
were
but
few
in
number
and
were
surrounded
by
a
great
many
enemies
they
used
to
endeavour
to
make
their
little
boys
very
brave
and
hardy
and
these
little
boys
used
to
be
always
running
about
in
the
open
air
and
wrestling
and
jumping
and
exercising
themselves
and
then
had
very
coarse
food
and
hard
beds
to
lie
upon
and
were
never
pampered
and
indulged
and
all
this
made
them
so
strong
and
hardy
and
brave
that
the
like
was
never
seen
what
and
had
they
no
coaches
to
ride
in
nor
sweetmeats
nor
wine
nor
anybody
to
wait
upon
them
oh
dear
no
their
fathers
thought
that
would
spoil
them
and
so
they
all
fared
alike
and
ate
together
in
great
rooms
and
there
they
were
taught
to
behave
orderly
and
decently
and
when
dinner
was
over
they
all
went
to
play
together
and
if
they
committed
any
faults
they
were
severely
whipped
but
they
never
minded
it
and
scorned
to
cry
out
or
make
a
wry
face
as
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
they
approached
the
village
where
tommy
laid
out
all
his
money
amounting
to
fifteen
shillings
and
sixpence
in
buying
some
clothes
for
the
little
ragged
boy
and
his
brothers
which
were
made
up
in
a
bundle
and
given
to
him
but
he
desired
harry
to
carry
them
for
him
that
i
will
said
harry
but
why
do
you
choose
to
carry
them
yourself
why
it
is
not
fit
for
a
gentleman
to
carry
things
himself
why
what
hurt
does
it
do
him
if
he
is
but
strong
enough
i
do
not
know
but
i
believe
it
is
that
he
may
not
look
like
the
common
people
then
he
should
not
have
hands
or
feet
or
ears
or
mouth
because
the
common
people
have
the
same
no
no
he
must
have
all
these
because
they
are
useful
and
is
it
not
useful
to
be
able
to
do
things
for
ourselves
yes
but
gentlemen
have
others
to
do
what
they
want
for
them
then
i
should
think
it
must
be
a
bad
thing
to
be
a
gentleman
why
so
because
if
all
were
gentlemen
nobody
would
do
anything
and
then
we
should
be
all
starved
starved
yes
why
you
could
not
live
could
you
without
bread
no
i
know
that
very
well
and
bread
is
made
of
a
plant
that
grows
in
the
earth
and
it
is
called
wheat
why
then
i
would
gather
it
and
eat
it
then
you
must
do
something
for
yourself
but
that
would
not
do
for
wheat
is
a
small
hard
grain
like
the
oats
which
you
have
sometimes
given
to
mr
barlow
horse
and
you
would
not
like
to
eat
them
no
certainly
but
how
comes
bread
then
why
they
send
the
corn
to
the
mill
what
is
a
mill
what
did
you
never
see
a
mill
no
never
but
i
should
like
to
see
one
that
i
may
know
how
they
make
bread
there
is
one
at
a
little
distance
and
if
you
ask
mr
barlow
he
will
go
with
you
for
he
knows
the
miller
very
well
that
i
will
for
i
should
like
to
see
them
make
bread
as
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
they
heard
a
great
outcry
and
turning
their
heads
saw
a
horse
that
was
galloping
violently
along
and
dragging
his
rider
along
with
him
who
had
fallen
off
and
in
falling
hitched
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
luckily
for
the
person
it
happened
to
be
wet
ground
and
the
side
of
a
hill
which
prevented
the
horse
from
going
very
fast
and
the
rider
from
being
much
hurt
but
harry
who
was
always
prepared
to
do
an
act
of
humanity
even
with
the
danger
of
his
life
and
besides
that
was
a
boy
of
extraordinary
courage
and
agility
ran
up
towards
a
gap
which
he
saw
the
horse
approaching
and
just
as
he
made
a
little
pause
before
vaulting
over
caught
him
by
the
bridle
and
effectually
stopped
him
from
proceeding
in
an
instant
another
gentleman
came
up
with
two
or
three
servants
who
alighted
from
their
horses
disengaged
the
fallen
person
and
set
him
upon
his
legs
he
stared
wildly
around
him
for
some
time
as
he
was
not
materially
hurt
he
soon
recovered
his
senses
and
the
first
use
he
made
of
them
was
to
swear
at
his
horse
and
to
ask
who
had
stopped
the
confounded
jade
who
said
his
friend
why
the
very
little
boy
you
used
so
scandalously
this
morning
had
it
not
been
for
his
dexterity
and
courage
that
numskull
of
yours
would
have
had
more
flaws
in
it
than
it
ever
had
before
the
squire
considered
harry
with
a
countenance
in
which
shame
and
humiliation
seemed
yet
to
struggle
with
his
natural
insolence
but
at
length
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
pulled
out
a
guinea
which
he
offered
to
harry
telling
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
very
sorry
for
what
had
happened
but
harry
with
a
look
of
more
contempt
than
he
had
ever
been
seen
to
assume
before
rejected
the
present
and
taking
up
the
bundle
which
he
had
dropped
at
the
time
he
had
seized
the
horse
walked
away
accompanied
by
his
companion
as
it
was
not
far
out
of
their
way
they
agreed
to
call
at
the
poor
man
cottage
whom
they
found
much
better
as
mr
barlow
had
been
there
the
preceding
night
and
given
him
such
medicines
as
he
judged
proper
for
his
disease
tommy
then
asked
for
the
little
boy
and
on
his
coming
in
told
him
that
he
had
now
brought
him
some
clothes
which
he
might
wear
without
fear
of
being
called
a
frenchman
as
well
as
some
more
for
his
little
brothers
the
pleasure
with
which
they
were
received
was
so
great
and
the
acknowledgments
and
blessings
of
the
good
woman
and
the
poor
man
who
had
just
began
to
sit
up
were
so
many
that
little
tommy
could
not
help
shedding
tears
of
compassion
in
which
he
was
joined
by
harry
as
they
were
returning
tommy
said
that
he
had
never
spent
any
money
with
so
much
pleasure
as
that
with
which
he
had
purchased
clothes
for
this
poor
family
and
that
for
the
future
he
would
take
care
of
all
the
money
that
was
given
him
for
that
purpose
instead
of
laying
it
out
in
eatables
and
playthings
some
days
after
this
as
mr
barlow
and
the
two
boys
were
walking
out
together
they
happened
to
pass
near
a
windmill
and
on
telling
tommy
what
it
was
tommy
desired
leave
to
go
into
it
and
look
at
it
mr
barlow
consented
to
this
and
being
acquainted
with
the
miller
they
all
went
in
and
examined
every
part
of
it
with
great
curiosity
and
there
little
tommy
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
sails
of
the
mill
being
constantly
turned
round
by
the
wind
moved
a
great
flat
stone
which
by
rubbing
upon
another
stone
bruised
all
the
corn
that
was
put
between
them
till
it
became
a
fine
powder
oh
dear
said
tommy
is
this
the
way
they
make
bread
mr
barlow
told
him
this
was
the
method
by
which
the
corn
was
prepared
for
making
bread
but
that
many
other
things
were
necessary
before
it
arrived
at
that
state
you
see
that
what
runs
from
these
millstones
is
only
a
fine
powder
very
different
from
bread
which
is
a
solid
and
tolerably
hard
substance
as
they
were
going
home
harry
said
to
tommy
so
you
see
now
if
nobody
chose
to
work
or
do
anything
for
himself
we
should
have
no
bread
to
eat
but
you
could
not
even
have
the
corn
to
make
it
of
without
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
labour
why
not
does
not
corn
grow
in
the
ground
of
itself
corn
grows
in
the
ground
but
then
first
it
is
necessary
to
plough
the
ground
to
break
it
to
pieces
what
is
ploughing
did
you
never
see
three
or
four
horses
drawing
something
along
the
fields
in
a
straight
line
while
one
man
drove
and
another
walked
behind
holding
the
thing
by
two
handles
yes
i
have
and
is
that
ploughing
it
is
and
there
is
a
sharp
iron
underneath
which
runs
into
the
ground
and
turns
it
up
all
the
way
it
goes
well
and
what
then
when
the
ground
is
thus
prepared
they
sow
the
seed
all
over
it
and
then
they
rake
it
over
to
cover
the
seed
and
then
the
seed
begins
to
grow
and
shoots
up
very
high
and
at
last
the
corn
ripens
and
they
reap
it
and
carry
it
home
i
protest
it
must
be
very
curious
and
i
should
like
to
sow
some
seed
myself
and
see
it
grow
do
you
think
i
could
yes
certainly
and
if
you
will
dig
the
ground
i
will
go
home
to
my
father
in
order
to
procure
some
seed
for
you
the
next
morning
tommy
was
up
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
went
to
work
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
where
he
dug
with
great
perseverance
till
breakfast
when
he
came
in
he
could
not
help
telling
mr
barlow
what
he
had
done
and
asking
him
whether
he
was
not
a
very
good
boy
for
working
so
hard
to
raise
corn
that
said
mr
barlow
depends
upon
the
use
you
intend
to
make
of
it
when
you
have
raised
it
what
is
it
you
intend
doing
with
it
why
sir
said
tommy
i
intend
to
send
it
to
the
mill
that
we
saw
and
have
it
ground
into
flour
and
then
i
will
get
you
to
show
me
how
to
make
bread
of
it
and
then
i
will
eat
it
that
i
may
tell
my
father
that
i
have
eaten
bread
out
of
corn
of
my
own
sowing
that
will
be
very
well
done
said
mr
barlow
but
where
will
be
the
great
goodness
that
you
sow
corn
for
your
own
eating
that
is
no
more
than
all
the
people
round
continually
do
and
if
they
did
not
do
it
they
would
be
obliged
to
fast
but
then
said
tommy
they
are
not
gentlemen
as
i
am
what
then
answered
mr
barlow
must
not
gentlemen
eat
as
well
as
others
and
therefore
is
it
not
for
their
interest
to
know
how
to
procure
food
as
well
as
other
people
yes
sir
answered
tommy
but
they
can
have
other
people
to
raise
it
for
them
so
that
they
are
not
obliged
to
work
for
themselves
how
does
that
happen
said
mr
barlow
why
sir
they
pay
other
people
to
work
for
them
or
buy
bread
when
it
is
made
as
much
as
they
want
then
they
pay
for
it
with
money
yes
sir
then
they
must
have
money
before
they
can
buy
corn
certainly
sir
but
have
all
gentlemen
money
tommy
hesitated
some
time
at
this
question
at
last
he
said
i
believe
not
always
sir
why
then
if
they
have
not
money
they
will
find
it
difficult
to
procure
corn
unless
they
raise
it
for
themselves
indeed
said
tommy
i
believe
they
will
for
perhaps
they
may
not
find
anybody
enough
to
give
it
them
but
said
mr
barlow
as
we
are
talking
upon
this
subject
i
will
tell
you
a
story
that
i
read
a
little
time
past
if
you
choose
to
hear
it
tommy
said
he
should
be
very
glad
if
mr
barlow
would
take
the
trouble
of
telling
it
to
him
and
mr
barlow
told
him
the
following
history
of
the
two
brothers
about
the
time
that
many
people
went
over
to
south
america
with
the
hopes
of
finding
gold
and
silver
there
was
a
spaniard
whose
name
was
pizarro
who
had
a
great
inclination
to
try
his
fortune
like
the
rest
but
as
he
had
an
elder
brother
for
whom
he
had
a
very
great
affection
he
went
to
him
told
him
his
design
and
solicited
him
very
much
to
go
along
with
him
promising
him
that
he
should
have
an
equal
share
of
all
the
riches
they
found
the
brother
whose
name
was
alonzo
was
a
man
of
a
contented
temper
and
a
good
understanding
he
did
not
therefore
much
approve
of
the
project
and
endeavoured
to
dissuade
pizarro
from
it
by
setting
before
him
the
danger
to
which
he
exposed
himself
and
the
uncertainty
of
his
succeeding
but
finding
all
that
he
said
was
vain
he
agreed
to
go
with
him
but
told
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
wanted
no
part
of
the
riches
which
he
might
find
and
would
ask
no
other
favour
than
to
have
his
baggage
and
a
few
servants
taken
on
board
the
vessel
with
him
pizarro
then
sold
all
that
he
had
bought
a
vessel
and
embarked
with
several
other
adventurers
who
had
all
great
expectations
like
himself
of
soon
becoming
rich
as
to
alonzo
he
took
nothing
with
him
but
a
few
ploughs
harrows
and
other
tools
and
some
corn
together
with
a
large
quantity
of
potatoes
and
some
seeds
of
different
vegetables
pizarro
thought
these
very
odd
preparations
for
a
voyage
but
as
he
did
not
think
proper
to
expostulate
with
his
brother
he
said
nothing
after
sailing
some
time
with
prosperous
winds
they
put
into
the
last
port
where
they
were
to
stop
before
they
came
to
the
country
where
they
were
to
search
for
gold
here
pizarro
bought
a
great
number
more
of
pickaxes
shovels
and
various
other
tools
for
digging
melting
and
refining
the
gold
he
expected
to
find
besides
hiring
an
additional
number
of
labourers
to
assist
him
in
the
work
alonzo
on
the
contrary
bought
only
a
few
sheep
and
four
stout
oxen
with
their
harness
and
food
enough
to
subsist
them
till
they
should
arrive
at
land
as
it
happened
they
met
with
a
favourable
voyage
and
all
landed
in
perfect
health
in
america
alonzo
then
told
his
brother
that
as
he
had
only
come
to
accompany
and
serve
him
he
would
stay
near
the
shore
with
his
servants
and
cattle
while
he
went
to
search
for
gold
and
when
he
had
acquired
as
much
as
he
desired
should
be
always
ready
to
embark
for
spain
with
him
pizarro
accordingly
set
out
not
without
feeling
so
great
a
contempt
for
his
brother
that
he
could
not
help
expressing
it
to
his
companions
always
thought
said
he
my
brother
had
been
a
man
of
sense
he
bore
that
character
in
spain
but
i
find
people
were
strangely
mistaken
in
him
here
he
is
going
to
divert
himself
with
his
sheep
and
his
oxen
as
if
he
was
living
quietly
upon
his
farm
at
home
and
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
raise
cucumbers
and
melons
but
we
know
better
what
to
do
with
our
time
so
come
along
my
lads
and
if
we
have
but
good
luck
we
shall
soon
be
enriched
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
all
that
were
present
applauded
pizarro
speech
and
declared
themselves
ready
to
follow
wherever
he
went
only
one
old
spaniard
shook
his
head
as
he
went
and
told
him
he
doubted
whether
he
would
find
his
brother
so
great
a
fool
as
he
thought
they
then
travelled
on
several
days
march
into
the
country
sometimes
obliged
to
cross
rivers
at
others
to
pass
mountains
and
forests
where
they
could
find
no
paths
sometimes
scorched
by
the
violent
heat
of
the
sun
and
then
wetted
to
the
skin
by
violent
showers
of
rain
these
difficulties
however
did
not
discourage
them
so
much
as
to
hinder
them
from
trying
in
several
places
for
gold
which
they
were
at
length
lucky
enough
to
find
in
a
considerable
quantity
this
success
animated
them
very
much
and
they
continued
working
upon
that
spot
till
all
their
provisions
were
consumed
they
gathered
daily
large
quantities
of
ore
but
then
they
suffered
very
much
from
hunger
still
however
they
persevered
in
their
labours
and
sustained
themselves
with
such
roots
and
berries
as
they
could
find
at
last
even
this
resource
failed
them
and
after
several
of
their
company
had
died
from
want
and
hardship
the
rest
were
just
able
to
crawl
back
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
alonzo
carrying
with
them
the
gold
to
acquire
which
they
had
suffered
so
many
miseries
but
while
they
had
been
employed
in
this
manner
alonzo
who
foresaw
what
would
happen
had
been
industriously
toiling
to
a
very
different
purpose
his
skill
in
husbandry
had
easily
enabled
him
to
find
a
spot
of
considerable
extent
and
very
fertile
soil
which
he
ploughed
up
with
the
oxen
he
had
brought
with
him
and
the
assistance
of
his
servants
he
then
sowed
the
different
seeds
he
had
brought
and
planted
the
potatoes
which
prospered
beyond
what
he
could
have
expected
and
yielded
him
a
most
abundant
harvest
his
sheep
he
had
turned
out
in
a
very
fine
meadow
near
the
sea
and
every
one
of
them
had
brought
him
a
couple
of
lambs
besides
that
he
and
his
servants
at
leisure
times
employed
themselves
in
fishing
and
the
fish
they
had
caught
were
all
dried
and
salted
with
salt
they
had
found
upon
the
so
that
by
the
time
of
pizarro
return
they
had
laid
up
a
very
considerable
quantity
of
provisions
when
pizarro
returned
his
brother
received
him
with
the
greatest
cordiality
and
asked
him
what
success
he
had
had
pizarro
told
him
that
they
had
found
an
immense
quantity
of
gold
but
that
several
of
his
companions
had
perished
and
that
the
rest
were
almost
starved
from
the
want
of
provisions
he
then
requested
that
his
brother
would
immediately
give
him
something
to
eat
as
he
assured
him
he
had
tasted
no
food
for
the
last
two
days
excepting
the
roots
and
bark
of
trees
alonzo
then
very
coolly
answered
that
he
should
remember
that
when
they
set
out
they
had
made
an
agreement
that
neither
should
interfere
with
the
other
that
he
had
never
desired
to
have
any
share
of
the
gold
which
pizarro
might
acquire
and
therefore
he
wondered
that
pizarro
should
expect
to
be
supplied
with
the
provisions
that
he
had
procured
with
so
much
care
and
labour
added
he
you
choose
to
exchange
some
of
the
gold
you
have
found
for
provisions
i
shall
perhaps
be
able
to
accommodate
you
pizarro
thought
this
behaviour
very
unkind
in
his
brother
but
as
he
and
his
companions
were
almost
starved
they
were
obliged
to
comply
with
his
demands
which
were
so
exorbitant
that
in
a
very
short
time
they
parted
with
all
the
gold
they
had
brought
with
them
merely
to
purchase
food
alonzo
then
proposed
to
his
brother
to
embark
for
spain
in
the
vessel
which
had
brought
them
thither
as
the
winds
and
weather
seemed
most
to
be
favourable
but
pizarro
with
an
angry
look
told
him
that
since
he
had
deprived
him
of
everything
he
had
gained
and
treated
him
in
so
unfriendly
a
manner
he
should
go
without
him
for
as
to
himself
he
would
rather
perish
upon
that
desert
shore
than
embark
with
so
inhuman
a
brother
but
alonzo
instead
of
resenting
these
reproaches
embraced
his
brother
with
the
greatest
tenderness
and
spoke
to
him
in
the
following
manner
you
then
believe
my
dearest
pizarro
that
i
really
meant
to
deprive
you
of
the
fruits
of
all
your
labours
which
you
have
acquired
with
so
much
toil
and
danger
rather
may
all
the
gold
in
the
universe
perish
than
i
should
be
capable
of
such
behaviour
to
my
dearest
brother
but
i
saw
the
rash
impetuous
desire
you
had
of
riches
and
wished
to
correct
this
fault
in
you
and
serve
you
at
the
same
time
you
despised
my
prudence
and
industry
and
imagined
that
nothing
could
be
wanting
to
him
that
had
once
acquired
wealth
but
you
have
now
learned
that
without
that
foresight
and
industry
all
the
gold
you
have
brought
with
you
would
not
have
prevented
you
from
perishing
miserably
you
are
now
i
hope
wiser
and
therefore
take
back
your
riches
which
i
hope
you
have
now
learned
to
make
a
proper
use
of
pizarro
was
equally
filled
with
gratitude
and
astonishment
at
this
generosity
of
his
brother
and
he
acknowledged
from
experience
that
industry
was
better
than
gold
they
then
embarked
for
spain
where
they
all
safely
arrived
during
the
voyage
pizarro
often
solicited
his
brother
to
accept
of
half
his
riches
which
alonzo
constantly
refused
telling
him
that
he
could
raise
food
enough
to
maintain
himself
and
was
in
no
want
of
gold
indeed
said
tommy
when
mr
barlow
had
finished
the
story
i
think
alonzo
was
a
very
sensible
man
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
his
brother
and
all
his
companions
must
have
been
starved
but
then
this
was
only
because
they
were
in
a
desert
uninhabited
country
this
could
never
have
happened
in
england
there
they
could
always
have
had
as
much
corn
or
bread
as
they
chose
for
their
money
but
said
mr
barlow
is
a
man
sure
to
be
always
in
england
or
some
place
where
he
can
purchase
bread
i
believe
so
sir
why
are
there
not
countries
in
the
world
where
there
are
no
inhabitants
and
where
no
corn
is
raised
certainly
sir
this
country
which
the
two
brothers
went
to
was
such
a
place
and
there
are
many
other
such
countries
in
the
world
but
then
a
man
need
not
go
to
them
he
may
stay
at
home
then
he
must
not
pass
the
seas
in
a
ship
why
so
sir
because
the
ship
may
happen
to
be
wrecked
on
some
such
country
where
there
are
no
inhabitants
and
then
although
he
should
escape
the
danger
of
the
sea
what
will
he
do
for
food
and
have
such
accidents
sometimes
happened
yes
several
there
was
in
particular
one
selkirk
who
was
shipwrecked
and
obliged
to
live
several
years
upon
a
desert
island
that
was
very
extraordinary
indeed
and
how
did
he
get
victuals
he
sometimes
procured
roots
sometimes
fruits
he
also
at
last
became
so
active
that
he
was
able
to
pursue
and
catch
wild
goats
with
which
the
island
abounded
and
did
not
such
a
hard
disagreeable
way
of
life
kill
him
at
last
by
no
means
he
never
enjoyed
better
health
in
his
life
and
you
have
heard
that
he
became
so
active
as
to
be
able
to
overtake
the
very
wild
beasts
but
a
still
more
extraordinary
story
is
that
of
some
russians
who
were
left
on
the
coast
of
spitzbergen
where
they
were
obliged
to
stay
several
years
where
is
spitzbergen
sir
it
is
a
country
very
far
to
the
north
which
is
constantly
covered
with
snow
and
ice
because
the
weather
is
unremittingly
severe
scarcely
any
vegetables
will
grow
upon
the
soil
and
scarcely
any
animals
are
found
in
the
country
to
add
to
this
a
great
part
of
the
year
it
is
covered
with
perpetual
darkness
and
is
inaccessible
to
ships
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
dreary
country
or
where
it
must
be
more
difficult
to
support
human
life
yet
four
men
were
capable
of
struggling
with
all
these
difficulties
during
several
years
and
three
of
them
returned
at
last
safe
to
their
own
country
this
must
be
a
very
curious
story
indeed
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
see
it
that
you
may
very
easily
when
i
read
it
i
copied
off
several
parts
of
it
i
thought
it
so
curious
and
interesting
which
i
can
easily
find
and
will
show
you
here
it
is
but
it
is
necessary
first
to
inform
you
that
those
northern
seas
from
the
intense
cold
of
the
climate
are
so
full
of
ice
as
frequently
to
render
it
extremely
dangerous
to
ships
lest
they
should
be
crushed
between
two
pieces
of
immense
size
or
so
completely
surrounded
as
not
to
be
able
to
extricate
themselves
having
given
you
this
previous
information
you
will
easily
understand
the
distressful
situation
of
a
russian
ship
which
as
it
was
sailing
on
those
seas
was
on
a
sudden
so
surrounded
by
ice
as
not
to
be
able
to
move
my
extracts
begin
here
and
you
may
read
them
from
a
narrative
of
the
extraordinary
adventures
of
four
russian
sailors
who
were
cast
away
on
the
desert
island
of
east
in
this
alarming
state
that
is
when
the
ship
was
surrounded
with
ice
a
council
was
held
when
the
mate
alexis
hinkof
informed
them
that
he
recollected
to
have
heard
that
some
of
the
people
of
mesen
some
time
before
having
formed
a
resolution
of
wintering
upon
this
island
had
carried
from
that
city
timber
proper
for
building
a
hut
and
had
actually
erected
one
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
this
information
induced
the
whole
company
to
resolve
on
wintering
there
if
the
hut
as
they
hoped
still
existed
for
they
clearly
perceived
the
imminent
danger
they
were
in
and
that
they
must
inevitably
perish
if
they
continued
in
the
ship
they
despatched
therefore
four
of
their
crew
in
search
of
the
hut
or
any
other
succour
they
could
meet
with
these
were
alexis
hinkof
the
mate
iwan
hinkof
his
godson
stephen
scharassof
and
feodor
weregin
as
the
shore
on
which
they
were
to
land
was
uninhabited
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
make
some
provision
for
their
expedition
they
had
almost
two
miles
to
travel
over
those
ridges
of
ice
which
being
raised
by
the
waves
and
driven
against
each
other
by
the
wind
rendered
the
way
equally
difficult
and
dangerous
prudence
therefore
forbade
their
loading
themselves
too
much
lest
by
being
overburdened
they
might
sink
in
between
the
pieces
of
ice
and
perish
having
thus
maturely
considered
the
nature
of
their
undertaking
they
provided
themselves
with
a
musket
and
containing
twelve
charges
of
powder
with
as
many
balls
an
axe
a
small
kettle
a
bag
with
about
twenty
pounds
of
flower
a
knife
a
and
tinder
a
bladder
filled
with
tobacco
and
every
man
his
wooden
pipe
thus
accoutred
these
four
sailors
quickly
arrived
on
the
island
little
expecting
the
misfortunes
that
would
befall
them
they
began
with
exploring
the
country
and
soon
discovered
the
hut
they
were
in
search
of
about
an
english
mile
and
a
half
from
the
shore
it
was
feet
in
length
eighteen
feet
in
height
and
as
many
in
breadth
it
contained
a
small
antechamber
about
twelve
feet
broad
which
had
two
doors
the
one
to
shut
it
up
from
the
outer
air
the
other
to
form
a
communication
with
the
inner
room
this
contributed
greatly
to
keep
the
large
room
warm
when
once
heated
in
the
large
room
was
an
earthen
stove
constructed
in
the
russian
manner
that
is
a
kind
of
oven
without
a
chimney
which
served
occasionally
either
for
baking
for
heating
the
room
or
as
is
customary
among
the
russian
peasants
in
very
cold
weather
for
a
place
to
sleep
upon
our
adventurers
rejoiced
greatly
at
having
discovered
the
hut
which
had
however
suffered
much
from
the
weather
it
having
now
been
built
a
considerable
time
they
however
contrived
to
pass
the
night
in
it
early
next
morning
they
hastened
to
the
shore
impatient
to
inform
their
comrades
of
their
success
and
also
to
procure
from
their
vessel
such
provision
ammunition
and
other
necessaries
as
might
better
enable
them
to
winter
on
the
island
i
leave
my
readers
to
figure
to
themselves
the
astonishment
and
agony
of
mind
these
poor
people
must
have
felt
when
on
reaching
the
place
of
their
landing
they
saw
nothing
but
an
open
sea
free
from
the
ice
which
but
the
day
before
had
covered
the
ocean
a
violent
storm
which
had
risen
during
the
night
had
certainly
been
the
cause
of
this
disastrous
event
but
they
could
not
tell
whether
the
ice
which
had
before
hemmed
in
the
vessel
agitated
by
the
violence
of
the
waves
had
been
driven
against
her
and
shattered
her
to
pieces
or
whether
she
had
been
carried
by
the
current
into
the
main
a
circumstance
which
frequently
happens
in
those
seas
whatever
accident
had
befallen
the
ship
they
saw
her
no
more
and
as
no
tidings
were
ever
afterwards
received
of
her
it
is
most
probable
that
she
sunk
and
that
all
on
board
of
her
perished
this
melancholy
event
depriving
the
unhappy
wretches
of
all
hope
of
ever
being
able
to
quit
the
island
they
returned
to
the
hut
whence
they
had
come
full
of
horror
and
despair
oh
dear
cried
tommy
at
this
passage
what
a
dreadful
situation
these
poor
people
must
have
been
in
to
be
in
such
a
cold
country
covered
with
snow
and
frozen
with
ice
without
anybody
to
help
them
or
give
them
victuals
i
should
think
they
must
all
have
died
that
you
will
soon
see
said
mr
barlow
when
you
have
read
the
rest
of
the
story
but
tell
me
one
thing
tommy
before
you
proceed
these
four
men
were
poor
sailors
who
had
always
been
accustomed
to
danger
and
hardships
and
to
work
for
their
living
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
them
to
have
been
bred
up
gentlemen
that
is
to
do
nothing
but
to
have
other
people
wait
upon
them
in
everything
why
to
be
sure
answered
tommy
it
was
much
better
for
them
that
they
had
been
used
to
work
for
that
might
enable
them
to
contrive
and
do
something
to
assist
themselves
for
without
doing
a
great
deal
they
must
certainly
all
have
perished
their
first
attention
was
employed
as
may
easily
be
imagined
in
devising
means
of
providing
subsistence
and
for
repairing
their
hut
the
twelve
charges
of
powder
which
they
had
brought
with
them
soon
procured
them
as
many
reindeer
the
island
fortunately
for
them
abounding
in
these
animals
i
have
before
observed
that
the
hut
which
the
sailors
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
had
sustained
some
damage
and
it
was
this
there
were
cracks
in
many
places
between
the
boards
of
the
building
which
freely
admitted
the
air
this
inconveniency
was
however
easily
remedied
as
they
had
an
axe
and
the
beams
were
still
sound
for
wood
in
those
cold
climates
continues
through
a
length
of
years
unimpaired
by
worms
or
decay
so
it
was
easy
for
them
to
make
the
boards
join
again
very
tolerably
besides
moss
growing
in
great
abundance
all
over
the
island
there
was
more
than
sufficient
to
stop
up
the
crevices
which
wooden
houses
must
always
be
liable
to
repairs
of
this
kind
cost
the
unhappy
men
less
trouble
as
they
were
russians
for
all
russian
peasants
are
known
to
be
good
carpenters
they
build
their
own
houses
and
are
very
expert
in
handling
the
axe
the
intense
cold
which
makes
these
climates
habitable
to
so
few
species
of
animals
renders
them
equally
unfit
for
the
production
of
vegetables
no
species
of
tree
or
even
shrub
is
found
in
any
of
the
islands
of
spitzbergen
a
circumstance
of
the
most
alarming
nature
to
our
sailors
without
fire
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
rigour
of
the
climate
and
without
wood
how
was
the
fire
to
be
produced
or
supported
however
in
wandering
along
the
beach
they
collected
plenty
of
wood
which
had
been
driven
ashore
by
the
waves
and
which
at
first
consisted
of
the
wrecks
of
ships
and
afterwards
of
whole
trees
with
their
roots
the
produce
of
some
hospitable
but
to
them
unknown
climate
which
the
overflowings
of
rivers
or
other
accidents
had
sent
into
the
ocean
nothing
proved
of
more
essential
service
to
these
unfortunate
men
during
the
first
year
of
their
exile
than
some
boards
they
found
upon
the
beach
having
a
long
iron
hook
some
nails
of
about
five
or
six
inches
long
and
proportionably
thick
and
other
bits
of
old
iron
fixed
in
them
the
melancholy
relics
of
some
vessels
cast
away
in
those
remote
parts
these
were
thrown
ashore
by
the
waves
at
the
time
when
the
want
of
powder
gave
our
men
reason
to
apprehend
that
they
must
fall
a
prey
to
hunger
as
they
had
nearly
consumed
those
reindeer
they
had
killed
this
lucky
circumstance
was
attended
with
another
equally
fortunate
they
found
on
the
shore
the
root
of
a
which
nearly
approached
to
the
figure
of
a
bow
as
necessity
has
ever
been
the
mother
of
invention
so
they
soon
fashioned
this
root
to
a
good
bow
by
the
help
of
a
knife
but
still
they
wanted
a
string
and
arrows
not
knowing
how
to
procure
them
at
present
they
resolved
upon
making
a
couple
of
lances
to
defend
themselves
against
the
white
bears
by
far
the
most
ferocious
of
their
kind
whose
attacks
they
had
great
reason
to
dread
finding
they
could
neither
make
the
heads
of
their
lances
nor
of
their
arrows
without
the
help
of
a
hammer
they
contrived
to
form
the
large
iron
hook
into
one
by
beating
it
and
widening
a
hole
it
happened
to
have
about
its
middle
with
the
help
of
one
of
their
largest
nails
this
received
the
handle
a
round
button
at
one
end
of
the
hook
served
for
the
face
of
the
hammer
a
large
pebble
supplied
the
place
of
an
anvil
and
a
couple
of
reindeer
horns
made
the
tongs
by
the
means
of
such
tools
they
made
two
heads
of
spears
and
after
polishing
and
sharpening
them
on
stones
they
tied
them
as
fast
as
possible
with
thongs
made
of
reindeer
skins
to
sticks
about
the
thickness
of
a
man
arm
which
they
got
from
some
branches
of
trees
that
had
been
cast
on
shore
thus
equipped
with
spears
they
resolved
to
attack
a
white
bear
and
after
a
most
dangerous
encounter
they
killed
the
formidable
creature
and
thereby
made
a
new
supply
of
provisions
the
flesh
of
this
animal
they
relished
exceedingly
as
they
thought
it
much
resembled
beef
in
taste
and
flavour
the
tendons
they
saw
with
much
pleasure
could
with
little
or
no
trouble
be
divided
into
filaments
of
what
fineness
they
thought
fit
this
perhaps
was
the
most
fortunate
discovery
these
men
could
have
made
for
besides
other
advantages
which
will
be
hereafter
mentioned
they
were
hereby
furnished
with
strings
for
their
bow
the
success
of
our
unfortunate
islanders
in
making
the
spears
and
the
use
these
proved
of
encouraged
them
to
proceed
and
forge
some
pieces
of
iron
into
heads
of
arrows
of
the
same
shape
though
somewhat
smaller
in
size
than
the
spears
having
ground
and
sharpened
these
like
the
former
they
tied
them
with
the
sinews
of
the
white
bears
to
pieces
of
fir
to
which
by
the
help
of
fine
threads
of
the
same
they
fastened
feathers
of
and
thus
became
possessed
of
a
complete
bow
and
arrows
their
ingenuity
in
this
respect
was
crowned
with
success
far
beyond
their
expectation
for
during
the
time
of
their
continuance
upon
the
island
with
these
arrows
they
killed
no
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
reindeer
besides
a
great
number
of
blue
and
white
foxes
the
flesh
of
these
animals
served
them
also
for
food
and
their
skins
for
clothing
and
other
necessary
preservatives
against
the
intense
coldness
of
a
climate
so
near
the
pole
they
killed
however
not
more
than
ten
white
bears
in
all
and
that
not
without
the
utmost
danger
for
these
animals
being
prodigiously
strong
defended
themselves
with
astonishing
vigour
and
fury
the
first
our
men
attacked
designedly
the
other
nine
they
slew
in
defending
themselves
from
their
assaults
for
some
of
these
creatures
even
ventured
to
enter
the
outer
room
of
the
hut
in
order
to
devour
them
it
is
true
that
all
the
bears
did
not
show
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
equal
intrepidity
either
owing
to
some
being
less
pressed
by
hunger
or
to
their
being
by
nature
less
carnivorous
than
the
others
for
some
of
them
which
entered
the
hut
immediately
betook
themselves
to
flight
on
the
first
attempt
of
the
sailors
to
drive
them
away
a
repetition
however
of
these
ferocious
attacks
threw
the
poor
men
into
great
terror
and
anxiety
as
they
were
in
almost
a
perpetual
danger
of
being
devoured
illustration
some
of
these
creatures
even
ventured
to
enter
the
outer
room
of
the
hut
in
order
to
devour
them
sure
exclaimed
tommy
such
a
life
as
that
must
have
been
miserable
and
dreadful
indeed
why
so
said
mr
barlow
because
being
always
in
danger
of
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
those
men
must
have
been
always
unhappy
and
yet
they
never
were
devoured
no
sir
because
they
made
weapons
to
defend
themselves
perhaps
then
a
person
is
not
unhappy
merely
because
he
is
exposed
to
danger
for
he
may
escape
from
it
but
because
he
does
not
know
how
to
defend
himself
i
do
not
exactly
understand
you
sir
i
will
give
you
an
instance
were
you
not
very
unhappy
when
the
snake
coiled
itself
round
your
leg
because
you
imagined
it
would
bite
you
yes
sir
but
harry
was
not
unhappy
that
is
very
true
sir
and
yet
he
was
in
more
danger
of
being
bitten
than
yourself
because
he
took
hold
of
it
indeed
he
did
but
he
knew
that
by
boldly
seizing
it
and
flinging
it
away
he
was
in
very
little
danger
had
you
therefore
known
the
same
you
probably
would
neither
have
feared
so
much
nor
have
been
so
unhappy
as
you
were
indeed
sir
that
is
true
and
were
such
an
accident
to
happen
again
i
think
i
should
have
courage
enough
to
do
the
same
should
you
then
be
as
unhappy
now
as
you
were
the
first
time
by
no
means
because
i
have
a
great
deal
more
courage
why
then
persons
that
have
courage
are
not
so
unhappy
as
those
that
are
cowardly
when
they
are
exposed
to
danger
certainly
not
sir
and
that
must
be
equally
true
in
every
kind
of
danger
indeed
it
must
for
i
have
sometimes
heard
my
mother
shriek
out
when
she
was
passing
in
a
coach
through
a
small
stream
of
water
while
my
father
only
laughed
at
her
why
then
if
she
had
possessed
as
much
courage
perhaps
she
would
have
laughed
too
indeed
i
believe
she
might
for
i
have
sometimes
seen
her
laugh
at
herself
when
it
was
over
for
being
so
cowardly
why
then
it
is
possible
that
when
these
men
found
they
were
so
well
able
to
defend
themselves
against
the
bears
they
might
no
longer
be
afraid
of
them
and
not
being
afraid
they
would
not
be
unhappy
indeed
i
believe
so
let
us
now
continue
the
three
different
kinds
of
animals
above
mentioned
the
reindeer
the
blue
and
white
foxes
and
the
white
bears
were
the
only
food
these
wretched
mariners
tasted
during
their
continuance
in
this
dreary
abode
we
do
not
at
once
see
every
resource
it
is
generally
necessity
which
quickens
our
invention
opening
by
degrees
our
eyes
and
pointing
out
expedients
which
otherwise
might
never
have
occurred
to
our
thoughts
the
truth
of
this
observation
our
four
sailors
experienced
in
various
instances
they
were
for
some
time
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
eating
their
meat
almost
raw
and
without
either
bread
or
salt
for
they
were
quite
destitute
of
both
the
intenseness
of
the
cold
together
with
the
want
of
proper
conveniences
prevented
them
from
cooking
their
victuals
in
a
proper
manner
there
was
but
one
stove
in
the
hut
and
that
being
set
up
agreeable
to
the
russian
taste
was
more
like
an
oven
and
consequently
not
well
adapted
for
boiling
anything
wood
also
was
too
precious
a
commodity
to
be
wasted
in
keeping
up
two
fires
and
the
one
they
might
have
made
out
of
their
habitation
to
dress
their
victuals
would
in
no
way
have
served
to
warm
them
another
reason
against
their
cooking
in
the
open
air
was
the
continual
danger
of
an
attack
from
the
white
bears
and
here
i
must
observe
that
suppose
they
had
made
the
attempt
it
would
still
have
been
practicable
for
only
some
part
of
the
year
for
the
cold
which
in
such
a
climate
for
some
months
scarcely
ever
abates
from
the
long
absence
of
the
sun
then
enlightening
the
opposite
hemisphere
the
inconceivable
quantity
of
snow
which
is
continually
falling
through
the
greatest
part
of
the
winter
together
with
the
almost
incessant
rains
at
certain
seasons
all
these
were
almost
insurmountable
to
that
expedient
to
remedy
therefore
in
some
degree
the
hardship
of
eating
their
meat
raw
they
bethought
themselves
of
drying
some
of
their
provisions
during
the
summer
in
the
open
air
and
afterwards
of
hanging
it
up
in
the
upper
part
of
the
hut
which
as
i
mentioned
before
was
continually
filled
with
smoke
down
to
the
windows
it
was
thus
dried
thoroughly
by
the
help
of
that
smoke
this
meat
so
prepared
they
used
for
bread
and
it
made
them
relish
their
other
flesh
the
better
as
they
could
only
it
finding
this
experiment
answer
in
every
respect
to
their
wishes
they
continued
to
practise
it
during
the
whole
time
of
their
confinement
upon
the
island
and
always
kept
up
by
that
means
a
sufficient
stock
of
provisions
water
they
had
in
summer
from
small
rivulets
that
fell
from
the
rocks
and
in
winter
from
the
snow
and
ice
thawed
this
was
of
course
their
only
beverage
and
their
small
kettle
was
the
only
vessel
they
could
make
use
of
for
this
and
other
purposes
i
have
mentioned
above
that
our
sailors
brought
a
small
bag
of
flour
with
them
to
the
island
of
this
they
had
consumed
about
with
their
meat
the
remainder
they
employed
in
a
different
manner
equally
useful
they
soon
saw
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
a
continual
fire
in
so
cold
a
climate
and
found
that
if
it
should
unfortunately
go
out
they
had
no
means
of
lighting
it
again
for
though
they
had
a
steel
and
flints
yet
they
wanted
both
match
and
tinder
in
their
excursions
through
the
island
they
had
met
with
a
slimy
loam
or
a
kind
of
clay
nearly
in
the
middle
of
it
out
of
this
they
found
means
to
form
a
utensil
which
might
serve
for
a
lamp
and
they
proposed
to
keep
it
constantly
burning
with
the
fat
of
the
animals
they
should
kill
this
was
certainly
the
most
rational
scheme
they
could
have
thought
of
for
to
be
without
a
light
in
a
climate
where
during
winter
darkness
reigns
for
several
months
together
would
have
added
much
to
their
other
calamities
pray
sir
stop
what
are
there
countries
in
the
world
where
it
is
night
continually
for
several
months
together
indeed
there
are
how
can
that
be
how
happens
it
that
there
is
night
at
all
how
happens
it
it
must
be
so
must
it
not
that
is
only
saying
that
you
do
not
know
the
reason
but
do
you
observe
no
difference
here
between
night
and
day
yes
sir
it
is
light
in
the
day
and
dark
in
the
night
but
why
is
it
dark
in
the
night
really
i
do
not
know
what
does
the
sun
shine
every
night
no
sir
certainly
not
then
it
only
shines
on
some
nights
and
not
on
others
it
never
shines
at
all
in
the
night
and
does
it
in
the
day
yes
sir
every
day
every
day
i
believe
only
sometimes
the
clouds
prevent
you
from
seeing
it
and
what
becomes
of
it
in
the
night
it
goes
away
so
that
we
can
not
see
it
so
then
when
you
can
see
the
sun
it
is
never
night
no
sir
but
when
the
sun
goes
away
the
night
comes
on
yes
sir
and
when
the
sun
comes
again
what
happens
then
it
is
day
again
for
i
have
seen
the
day
break
and
the
sun
always
rises
presently
after
then
if
the
sun
were
not
to
rise
for
several
months
together
what
would
happen
sure
it
would
always
remain
night
and
be
dark
that
is
exactly
the
case
with
the
countries
we
are
reading
about
having
therefore
fashioned
a
kind
of
lamp
they
filled
it
with
reindeer
fat
and
stuck
into
it
some
twisted
linen
shaped
into
a
wick
but
they
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
as
soon
as
the
fat
melted
it
not
only
soaked
into
the
clay
but
fairly
ran
out
of
it
on
all
sides
the
thing
therefore
was
to
devise
some
means
of
preventing
this
inconvenience
not
arising
from
cracks
but
from
the
substance
of
which
the
lamp
was
made
being
too
porous
they
made
therefore
a
new
one
dried
it
thoroughly
in
the
air
then
heated
it
and
afterwards
quenched
it
in
their
kettle
wherein
they
had
boiled
a
quantity
of
flour
down
to
the
consistence
of
thin
starch
the
lamp
being
thus
dried
and
filled
with
melted
fat
they
now
found
to
their
great
joy
that
it
did
not
leak
but
for
greater
security
they
dipped
linen
rags
in
their
paste
and
with
them
covered
all
its
outside
succeeding
in
this
attempt
they
immediately
made
another
lamp
for
fear
of
an
accident
that
at
all
events
they
might
not
be
destitute
of
light
and
when
they
had
done
so
much
they
thought
proper
to
save
the
remainder
of
their
flour
for
similar
purposes
as
they
had
carefully
collected
whatever
happened
to
be
cast
on
shore
to
supply
them
with
fuel
they
had
found
amongst
the
wrecks
of
vessels
some
cordage
and
a
small
quantity
of
oakum
a
kind
of
hemp
used
for
caulking
ships
which
served
them
to
make
wicks
for
their
lamps
when
these
stores
began
to
fail
their
shirts
and
their
drawers
which
are
worn
by
almost
all
the
russian
peasants
were
employed
to
make
good
the
deficiency
by
these
means
they
kept
their
lamp
burning
without
intermission
from
the
day
they
first
made
it
a
work
they
set
about
soon
after
their
arrival
on
the
island
until
that
of
their
embarkation
for
their
native
country
the
necessity
of
converting
the
most
essential
part
of
their
clothing
such
as
their
shirts
and
drawers
to
the
use
above
specified
exposed
them
the
more
to
the
rigour
of
the
climate
they
also
found
themselves
in
want
of
shoes
boots
and
other
articles
of
dress
and
as
winter
was
approaching
they
were
again
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
that
ingenuity
which
necessity
suggests
and
which
seldom
fails
in
the
trying
hour
of
distress
they
had
skins
of
reindeer
and
foxes
in
plenty
that
had
hitherto
served
them
for
bedding
and
which
they
now
thought
of
employing
in
some
more
essential
service
but
the
question
was
how
to
tan
them
after
deliberating
on
this
subject
they
took
to
the
following
method
they
soaked
the
skins
for
several
days
in
fresh
water
till
they
could
pull
off
the
hair
very
easily
they
then
rubbed
the
wet
leather
with
their
hands
till
it
was
nearly
dry
when
they
spread
some
melted
reindeer
fat
over
it
and
again
rubbed
it
well
by
this
process
the
leather
became
soft
pliant
and
supple
proper
for
answering
every
purpose
they
wanted
it
for
those
skins
which
they
designed
for
furs
they
only
soaked
one
day
to
prepare
them
for
being
wrought
and
then
proceeded
in
the
manner
except
only
that
they
did
not
remove
the
hair
thus
they
soon
provided
themselves
with
the
necessary
materials
for
all
the
parts
of
dress
they
wanted
but
here
another
difficulty
occurred
they
had
neither
awls
for
making
shoes
or
boots
nor
needles
for
sewing
their
garments
this
want
however
they
soon
supplied
by
means
of
the
pieces
of
iron
they
had
occasionally
collected
out
of
these
they
made
both
and
by
their
industry
even
brought
them
to
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
the
making
eyes
to
their
needles
gave
them
indeed
no
little
trouble
but
this
they
also
performed
with
the
assistance
of
their
knife
for
having
ground
it
to
a
very
sharp
point
and
heated
a
kind
of
wire
forged
for
that
purpose
they
pierced
a
hole
through
one
end
and
by
whetting
and
smoothing
it
on
stones
brought
the
other
to
a
point
and
thus
gave
the
whole
needle
a
very
tolerable
form
scissors
to
cut
out
the
skin
were
what
they
next
had
occasion
for
but
having
none
their
place
they
supplied
with
the
knife
and
though
there
was
neither
shoemaker
nor
tailor
amongst
them
yet
they
had
contrived
to
cut
out
the
leather
and
furs
well
enough
for
their
purpose
the
sinews
of
the
bears
and
the
reindeer
which
as
i
mentioned
before
they
had
found
means
to
split
served
them
for
thread
and
thus
provided
with
the
necessary
implements
they
proceeded
to
make
their
new
clothes
these
said
mr
barlow
are
the
extracts
which
i
have
made
from
this
very
extraordinary
story
and
they
are
sufficient
to
show
both
the
many
accidents
to
which
men
are
exposed
and
the
wonderful
expedients
which
may
be
found
out
even
in
the
most
dismal
circumstances
it
is
very
true
indeed
answered
tommy
but
pray
what
became
of
these
poor
men
at
last
after
they
had
lived
more
than
six
years
upon
this
dreary
and
inhospitable
coast
answered
mr
barlow
a
ship
arrived
there
by
accident
which
took
three
of
them
on
board
and
carried
them
in
safety
to
their
own
country
and
what
became
of
the
fourth
said
tommy
he
said
mr
barlow
was
seized
with
a
dangerous
disease
called
the
scurvy
and
being
of
an
indolent
temper
and
therefore
not
using
the
exercise
which
was
necessary
to
preserve
his
life
after
having
lingered
some
time
died
and
was
buried
in
the
snow
by
his
companions

made
here
little
harry
came
in
from
his
father
house
and
brought
with
him
the
chicken
which
it
had
been
mentioned
he
had
saved
from
the
claws
of
the
kite
the
little
animal
was
now
perfectly
recovered
of
the
hurt
it
had
received
and
showed
so
great
a
degree
of
affection
to
its
protector
that
it
would
run
after
him
like
a
dog
hop
upon
his
shoulder
nestle
in
his
bosom
and
eat
crumbs
out
of
his
hand
tommy
was
extremely
surprised
and
pleased
to
remark
its
tameness
and
docility
and
asked
by
what
means
it
had
been
made
so
gentle
harry
told
him
he
had
taken
no
particular
pains
about
it
but
that
as
the
poor
little
creature
had
been
sadly
hurt
he
had
fed
it
every
day
till
it
was
well
and
that
in
consequence
of
that
kindness
it
had
conceived
a
great
degree
of
affection
towards
him
indeed
said
tommy
that
is
very
surprising
for
i
thought
all
birds
had
flown
away
whenever
a
man
came
near
them
and
that
even
the
fowls
which
are
kept
at
home
would
never
let
you
touch
them
and
what
do
you
imagine
is
the
reason
of
that
because
they
are
wild
and
what
is
a
fowl
being
wild
when
he
will
not
let
you
come
near
him
then
a
fowl
is
wild
because
he
will
not
let
you
come
near
him
this
is
saying
nothing
more
than
that
when
a
fowl
is
wild
he
will
not
let
you
approach
him
but
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
reason
of
his
being
wild
indeed
sir
i
can
not
tell
unless
it
is
because
they
are
naturally
so
but
if
they
were
naturally
so
this
fowl
could
not
be
fond
of
harry
that
is
because
he
is
so
good
to
it
very
likely
then
it
is
not
natural
for
an
animal
to
run
away
from
a
person
that
is
good
to
him
no
sir
i
believe
not
but
when
a
person
is
not
good
to
him
or
endeavours
to
hurt
him
it
is
natural
for
an
animal
to
run
away
from
him
is
it
not
yes
and
then
you
say
he
is
wild
do
you
not
yes
sir
why
then
it
is
probable
that
animals
are
only
wild
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
hurt
and
that
they
only
run
away
from
the
fear
of
danger
i
believe
you
would
do
the
same
from
a
lion
or
a
tiger
indeed
i
would
sir
and
yet
you
do
not
call
yourself
a
wild
animal
tommy
laughed
heartily
at
this
and
said
no
therefore
said
mr
barlow
if
you
want
to
tame
animals
you
must
be
good
to
them
and
treat
them
kindly
and
then
they
will
no
longer
fear
you
but
come
to
you
and
love
you
indeed
said
harry
that
is
very
true
for
i
knew
a
little
boy
that
took
a
great
fancy
to
a
snake
that
lived
in
his
father
garden
and
when
he
had
the
milk
for
breakfast
he
used
to
sit
under
a
nut
tree
and
whistle
and
the
snake
would
come
to
him
and
eat
out
of
his
bowl
and
did
it
not
bite
him
no
he
sometimes
used
to
give
it
a
pat
with
his
spoon
if
it
ate
too
fast
but
it
never
hurt
him
tommy
was
much
pleased
with
this
conversation
and
being
both
and
desirous
of
making
experiments
he
determined
to
try
his
skill
in
taming
animals
accordingly
he
took
a
large
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
and
went
out
to
seek
some
animal
that
he
might
give
it
to
the
first
thing
that
he
happened
to
meet
was
a
sucking
pig
that
had
rambled
from
its
mother
and
was
basking
in
the
sun
tommy
would
not
neglect
the
opportunity
of
showing
his
talents
he
therefore
called
pig
pig
pig
come
hither
little
pig
but
the
pig
who
did
not
exactly
comprehend
his
intentions
only
grunted
and
ran
away
you
little
ungrateful
thing
said
tommy
do
you
treat
me
in
this
manner
when
i
want
to
feed
you
if
you
do
not
know
your
friends
i
must
teach
you
so
saying
this
he
sprang
at
the
pig
and
caught
him
by
the
intending
to
have
given
him
the
bread
which
he
had
in
his
hand
but
the
pig
who
was
not
used
to
be
treated
in
that
manner
began
struggling
and
squeaking
to
that
degree
that
the
sow
who
was
within
hearing
came
running
to
the
place
with
all
the
rest
of
the
litter
at
her
heels
as
tommy
did
not
know
whether
she
would
be
pleased
with
his
civilities
to
her
young
one
or
not
he
thought
it
most
prudent
to
let
it
go
and
the
pig
endeavouring
to
escape
as
speedily
as
possible
unfortunately
ran
between
his
legs
and
threw
him
down
the
place
where
this
accident
happened
was
extremely
wet
therefore
tommy
in
falling
dirtied
himself
from
head
to
foot
and
the
sow
who
came
up
at
that
instant
passed
over
him
as
he
attempted
to
rise
and
rolled
him
back
again
into
the
mire
tommy
who
was
not
the
coolest
in
his
temper
was
extremely
provoked
at
this
ungrateful
return
for
his
intended
kindness
and
losing
all
patience
he
seized
the
sow
by
the
and
began
pommelling
her
with
all
his
might
as
she
attempted
to
escape
the
sow
as
may
be
imagined
did
not
relish
such
treatment
but
endeavoured
with
all
her
force
to
escape
but
tommy
still
keeping
his
hold
and
continuing
his
discipline
she
struggled
with
such
violence
as
to
drag
him
several
yards
squeaking
at
the
same
time
in
the
most
lamentable
manner
in
which
she
was
joined
by
the
whole
litter
of
pigs
during
the
heat
of
this
contest
a
large
flock
of
geese
happened
to
be
crossing
the
road
into
the
midst
of
which
the
affrighted
sow
ran
headlong
dragging
the
enraged
tommy
at
her
heels
the
goslings
retreated
with
the
greatest
precipitation
joining
their
mournful
cackling
to
the
general
noise
but
a
gander
of
more
than
common
size
and
courage
resenting
the
unprovoked
attack
which
had
been
made
upon
his
family
flew
at
tommy
hinder
parts
and
gave
him
several
severe
strokes
with
his
bill
tommy
whose
courage
had
hitherto
been
unconquerable
being
thus
unexpectedly
attacked
by
a
new
enemy
was
obliged
to
yield
to
fortune
and
not
knowing
the
precise
extent
of
his
danger
he
not
only
suffered
the
sow
to
escape
but
joined
his
vociferations
to
the
general
scream
this
alarmed
mr
barlow
who
coming
up
to
the
place
found
his
pupil
in
the
most
woeful
plight
daubed
from
head
to
foot
with
his
face
and
hands
as
black
as
those
of
any
he
inquired
what
was
the
matter
and
tommy
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
breath
enough
to
speak
answered
in
this
manner
sir
all
this
is
owing
to
what
you
told
me
about
taming
animals
i
wanted
to
make
them
tame
and
gentle
and
to
love
me
and
you
see
the
consequences
indeed
said
mr
barlow
i
see
you
have
been
but
i
hope
you
are
not
hurt
and
if
it
is
owing
to
anything
i
have
said
i
shall
feel
the
more
concern
no
said
tommy
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
much
hurt
why
then
said
mr
barlow
you
had
better
go
and
wash
yourself
and
when
you
are
clean
we
will
talk
over
the
affair
together
when
tommy
had
returned
mr
barlow
asked
him
how
the
accident
had
happened
and
when
he
had
heard
the
story
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
misfortune
but
i
do
not
perceive
that
i
was
the
cause
of
it
for
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
advised
you
to
catch
pigs
by
the
hinder
leg
no
sir
but
you
told
me
that
feeding
animals
was
the
way
to
make
them
love
me
and
so
i
wanted
to
feed
the
pig
but
it
was
not
my
fault
that
you
attempted
it
in
a
wrong
manner
the
animal
did
not
know
your
intentions
and
therefore
when
you
seized
him
in
so
violent
a
manner
he
naturally
attempted
to
escape
and
his
mother
hearing
his
cries
very
naturally
came
to
his
assistance
all
that
happened
was
owing
to
your
inexperience
before
you
meddle
with
any
animal
you
should
make
yourself
acquainted
with
his
nature
and
disposition
otherwise
you
may
fare
like
the
little
boy
that
in
attempting
to
catch
flies
was
stung
by
a
wasp
or
like
another
that
seeing
an
adder
sleeping
upon
a
bank
took
it
for
an
eel
and
was
bitten
by
it
which
had
nearly
cost
him
his
life
but
sir
i
thought
harry
had
mentioned
a
little
boy
that
used
to
feed
a
snake
without
receiving
any
hurt
from
it
that
might
very
well
happen
there
is
scarcely
any
creature
that
will
do
hurt
unless
it
is
attacked
or
wants
food
and
some
of
these
reptiles
are
entirely
harmless
others
not
therefore
the
best
way
is
not
to
meddle
with
any
till
you
are
perfectly
acquainted
with
its
nature
had
you
observed
this
rule
you
never
would
have
attempted
to
catch
the
pig
by
the
hinder
leg
in
order
to
tame
it
and
it
is
very
lucky
that
you
did
not
make
the
experiment
upon
a
larger
animal
otherwise
you
might
have
been
as
badly
treated
as
the
tailor
was
by
the
elephant
pray
sir
what
is
this
curious
story
but
first
tell
me
if
you
please
what
an
elephant
is
an
elephant
said
mr
barlow
is
the
largest
land
animal
that
we
are
acquainted
with
it
is
many
times
thicker
than
an
ox
and
grows
to
the
height
of
eleven
or
twelve
feet
its
strength
as
may
be
easily
imagined
is
prodigious
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
so
very
gentle
that
it
rarely
does
hurt
to
anything
even
in
woods
where
it
resides
it
does
not
eat
flesh
but
lives
upon
the
fruits
and
branches
of
trees
but
what
is
most
singular
about
its
make
is
that
instead
of
a
nose
it
has
a
long
hollow
piece
of
flesh
which
grows
over
its
mouth
to
the
length
of
three
or
four
feet
this
is
called
the
trunk
of
the
elephant
and
he
is
capable
of
bending
it
in
every
direction
when
he
wants
to
break
off
the
branch
of
a
tree
he
twists
his
trunk
round
it
and
snaps
it
off
directly
when
he
wants
to
drink
he
lets
it
down
into
the
water
sucks
up
several
gallons
at
a
time
and
then
doubling
the
end
of
it
back
discharges
it
all
into
his
mouth
but
if
he
is
so
large
and
strong
said
tommy
i
should
suppose
it
must
be
impossible
ever
to
tame
him
so
perhaps
it
would
replied
mr
barlow
did
they
not
instruct
those
that
have
been
already
tamed
to
assist
in
catching
others
how
is
that
sir
when
they
have
discovered
a
forest
where
these
animals
resort
they
make
a
large
enclosure
with
strong
pales
and
a
deep
ditch
leaving
only
one
entrance
to
it
which
has
a
strong
gate
left
purposely
open
they
then
let
one
or
two
of
their
tame
elephants
loose
who
join
the
wild
ones
and
gradually
entice
them
into
the
enclosure
as
soon
as
one
of
these
has
entered
a
man
who
stands
ready
shuts
the
gate
and
takes
him
prisoner
the
animal
finding
himself
thus
entrapped
begins
to
grow
furious
and
attempts
to
escape
but
immediately
two
tame
ones
of
the
largest
size
and
greatest
strength
who
have
been
placed
there
on
purpose
come
up
to
him
one
on
each
side
and
beat
him
with
their
trunks
till
he
becomes
more
quiet
a
man
then
comes
behind
ties
a
very
large
cord
to
each
of
his
and
fastens
the
other
end
of
it
to
two
great
trees
he
is
then
left
without
food
for
some
hours
and
in
that
time
generally
becomes
so
docile
as
to
suffer
himself
to
be
conducted
to
the
stable
that
is
prepared
for
him
where
he
lives
the
rest
of
his
life
like
a
horse
or
any
other
sort
of
domestic
animal
and
pray
sir
what
did
the
elephant
do
to
the
tailor
there
was
said
mr
barlow
at
surat
a
city
where
many
of
these
tame
elephants
are
kept
a
tailor
who
used
to
sit
and
work
in
his
shed
close
to
the
place
to
which
these
elephants
were
led
every
day
to
drink
this
man
contracted
a
kind
of
acquaintance
with
one
of
the
largest
of
these
beasts
and
used
to
present
him
with
fruits
and
other
vegetables
whenever
the
elephant
passed
by
his
door
the
elephant
was
accustomed
to
put
his
long
trunk
in
at
the
window
and
to
receive
in
that
manner
whatever
his
friend
chose
to
give
but
one
day
the
tailor
happened
to
be
in
a
more
than
ordinary
and
not
considering
how
dangerous
it
might
prove
to
provoke
an
animal
of
that
size
and
strength
when
the
elephant
put
his
trunk
in
at
the
window
as
usual
instead
of
giving
him
anything
to
eat
he
pricked
him
with
his
needle
the
elephant
instantly
withdrew
his
trunk
and
without
showing
any
marks
of
resentment
went
on
with
the
rest
to
drink
but
after
he
had
quenched
his
thirst
he
collected
a
large
quantity
of
the
dirtiest
water
he
could
find
in
his
trunk
which
i
have
already
told
you
is
capable
of
holding
many
gallons
and
when
he
passed
by
the
tailor
shop
in
his
return
he
discharged
it
full
in
his
face
with
so
true
an
aim
that
he
wetted
him
all
over
and
almost
drowned
him
thus
justly
punishing
the
man
for
his
and
breach
of
friendship
indeed
said
harry
considering
the
strength
of
the
animal
he
must
have
had
a
great
moderation
and
generosity
not
to
have
punished
the
man
more
severely
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
a
very
great
shame
to
men
ever
to
be
cruel
to
animals
when
they
are
so
affectionate
and
humane
to
them
you
are
very
right
said
mr
barlow
and
i
remember
another
story
of
an
elephant
which
if
true
is
still
more
extraordinary
these
animals
although
in
general
they
are
as
docile
and
obedient
to
the
person
that
takes
care
of
them
as
a
dog
are
sometimes
seized
with
a
species
of
impatience
which
makes
them
absolutely
ungovernable
it
is
then
dangerous
to
come
near
them
and
very
difficult
to
restrain
them
i
should
have
mentioned
that
in
the
eastern
parts
of
the
world
where
elephants
are
found
the
kings
and
princes
keep
them
to
ride
upon
as
we
do
horses
a
kind
of
tent
or
pavilion
is
fixed
upon
the
back
of
the
animal
in
which
one
or
more
persons
are
placed
and
the
keeper
that
is
used
to
manage
him
sits
upon
the
neck
of
the
elephant
and
guides
him
by
means
of
a
pole
with
an
iron
hook
at
the
end
now
as
these
animals
are
of
great
value
the
keeper
is
frequently
severely
punished
if
any
accident
happens
to
the
animal
by
his
carelessness
but
one
day
one
of
the
largest
elephants
being
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
passion
had
broken
loose
and
as
the
keeper
was
not
in
the
way
nobody
was
able
to
appease
him
or
dared
to
come
near
him
while
therefore
he
was
running
about
in
this
manner
he
chanced
to
see
the
wife
of
his
keeper
who
had
often
fed
him
as
well
as
her
husband
with
her
young
child
in
her
arms
with
which
she
was
endeavouring
to
escape
from
his
fury
the
woman
ran
as
fast
as
she
was
able
but
finding
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
escape
because
these
beasts
although
so
very
large
are
able
to
run
very
fast
she
resolutely
turned
about
and
throwing
her
child
down
before
the
elephant
thus
accosted
him
as
if
he
had
been
capable
of
understanding
her
you
ungrateful
beast
is
this
the
return
you
make
for
all
the
benefits
we
have
bestowed
have
we
fed
you
and
taken
care
of
you
by
day
and
night
during
so
many
years
only
that
you
may
at
last
destroy
us
all
crush
then
this
poor
innocent
child
and
me
in
return
for
the
services
that
my
husband
has
done
you
while
she
was
making
these
passionate
exclamations
the
elephant
approached
the
place
where
the
little
infant
lay
but
instead
of
trampling
upon
him
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
with
earnestness
as
if
he
had
been
sensible
of
shame
and
confusion
and
his
fury
from
that
instant
abating
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
without
opposition
to
his
stable
tommy
thanked
mr
barlow
for
these
two
stories
and
promised
for
the
future
to
use
more
discretion
in
his
kindness
to
animals
the
next
day
tommy
and
harry
went
into
the
garden
to
sow
the
wheat
which
harry
had
brought
with
him
upon
a
bed
which
tommy
had
dug
for
that
purpose
while
they
were
at
work
tommy
said
pray
harry
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
the
men
that
were
obliged
to
live
six
years
upon
that
terrible
cold
country
i
forget
the
name
of
it
where
there
is
nothing
but
snow
and
ice
and
scarcely
any
other
animals
but
great
bears
that
are
ready
to
eat
men
up
yes
i
have
and
did
not
the
very
thoughts
of
it
frighten
you
dreadfully
no
i
can
not
say
they
did
why
should
you
like
to
live
in
such
a
country
no
certainly
i
am
very
happy
that
i
was
born
in
such
a
country
as
this
where
the
weather
is
scarcely
ever
too
hot
or
too
cold
but
a
man
must
bear
patiently
whatever
is
his
lot
in
this
world
that
is
true
but
should
you
not
cry
and
be
very
much
afflicted
if
you
were
left
upon
such
a
country
i
should
certainly
be
very
sorry
if
i
was
left
there
alone
more
especially
as
i
am
not
big
enough
or
strong
enough
to
defend
myself
against
such
fierce
animals
but
the
crying
would
do
me
no
good
it
would
be
better
to
do
something
and
endeavour
to
help
myself
indeed
i
think
it
would
but
what
could
you
do
why
i
should
endeavour
to
build
myself
a
house
if
i
could
find
myself
materials
and
what
materials
is
a
house
made
of
i
thought
it
had
been
impossible
to
make
a
house
without
having
a
great
many
people
of
different
trades
such
as
carpenters
and
bricklayers
you
know
there
are
houses
of
different
sizes
the
houses
that
the
poor
people
live
in
are
very
different
from
your
father
house
yes
they
are
little
nasty
dirty
disagreeable
places
i
should
not
like
to
live
in
them
at
all
and
yet
the
poor
are
in
general
as
strong
and
healthy
as
the
rich
but
if
you
could
have
no
other
you
would
rather
live
in
one
of
them
than
be
exposed
to
the
weather
yes
certainly
and
how
would
you
make
one
of
them
if
i
could
get
any
wood
and
had
a
hatchet
i
would
cut
down
some
branches
of
trees
and
stick
them
upright
in
the
ground
near
to
each
other
and
what
then
i
would
then
get
some
other
branches
but
more
full
of
small
wood
and
these
i
would
interweave
between
them
just
as
we
make
hurdles
to
confine
the
sheep
and
then
as
that
might
not
be
warm
enough
to
resist
the
wind
and
cold
i
would
cover
them
over
both
within
and
without
with
clay
clay
what
is
that
it
is
a
particular
kind
of
earth
that
sticks
to
your
feet
when
you
tread
upon
it
or
to
your
hands
when
you
touch
it
i
declare
i
did
not
think
it
had
been
so
easy
to
make
a
house
and
do
you
think
that
people
could
really
live
in
such
houses
certainly
they
might
because
many
persons
live
in
such
houses
here
and
i
have
been
told
that
in
many
parts
of
the
world
they
have
not
any
other
really
i
should
like
to
try
to
make
a
house
do
you
think
harry
that
you
and
i
could
make
one
yes
if
i
had
wood
and
clay
enough
i
think
i
could
and
a
small
hatchet
to
sharpen
the
stakes
and
make
them
enter
the
ground
mr
barlow
then
came
to
call
them
in
to
read
and
told
tommy
that
as
he
had
been
talking
so
much
about
to
animals
he
had
looked
him
out
a
very
pretty
story
upon
the
subject
and
begged
that
he
would
read
it
well
that
i
will
said
tommy
for
i
begin
to
like
reading
extremely
and
i
think
that
i
am
happier
too
since
i
learned
it
for
now
i
can
always
divert
myself
indeed
answered
mr
barlow
most
people
find
it
so
when
any
one
can
read
he
will
not
find
the
knowledge
any
burthen
to
him
and
it
is
his
own
fault
if
he
is
not
constantly
amused
this
is
an
advantage
tommy
which
a
gentleman
since
you
are
so
fond
of
the
word
may
more
particularly
enjoy
because
he
has
so
much
time
at
his
own
disposal
and
it
is
much
better
that
he
should
distinguish
himself
by
having
more
knowledge
and
improvement
than
others
than
by
fine
clothes
or
any
such
trifles
which
any
one
may
have
that
can
purchase
them
as
well
as
himself
tommy
then
read
with
a
clear
and
distinct
voice
the
following
story
of
the
little
boy
a
little
boy
went
out
one
morning
to
walk
to
a
village
about
five
miles
from
the
place
where
he
lived
and
carried
with
him
in
a
basket
the
provision
that
was
to
serve
him
the
whole
day
as
he
was
walking
along
a
poor
little
dog
came
up
to
him
wagging
his
tail
and
seeming
to
entreat
him
to
take
compassion
on
him
the
little
boy
at
first
took
no
notice
of
him
but
at
length
remarking
how
lean
and
famished
the
creature
seemed
to
be
he
said
animal
is
certainly
in
very
great
necessity
if
i
give
him
part
of
my
provision
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
home
hungry
myself
however
as
he
seems
to
want
it
more
than
i
do
he
shall
partake
with
me
saying
this
he
gave
the
dog
part
of
what
he
had
in
the
basket
who
ate
as
if
he
had
not
tasted
victuals
for
a
fortnight
the
little
boy
then
went
on
a
little
farther
his
dog
still
following
him
and
fawning
upon
him
with
the
greatest
gratitude
and
affection
when
he
saw
a
poor
old
horse
lying
upon
the
ground
and
groaning
as
if
he
was
very
ill
he
went
up
to
him
and
saw
that
he
was
almost
starved
and
so
weak
that
he
was
unable
to
rise
am
very
much
afraid
said
the
little
boy
i
stay
to
assist
this
horse
that
it
will
be
dark
before
i
can
return
and
i
have
heard
that
there
are
several
thieves
in
the
neighbourhood
however
i
will
try
it
is
doing
a
good
action
to
attempt
to
relieve
him
and
god
almighty
will
take
care
of
me
he
then
went
and
gathered
some
grass
which
he
brought
to
the
horse
mouth
who
immediately
began
to
eat
with
as
much
relish
as
if
his
chief
disease
was
hunger
he
then
fetched
some
water
in
his
hat
which
the
animal
drank
up
and
seemed
immediately
to
be
so
much
refreshed
that
after
a
few
trials
he
got
up
and
began
grazing
the
little
boy
then
went
on
a
little
farther
and
saw
a
man
wading
about
in
a
pond
of
water
without
being
able
to
get
out
of
it
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours
is
the
matter
good
man
said
the
little
boy
to
him
you
find
your
way
out
of
this
pond
god
bless
you
my
worthy
master
or
miss
said
the
man
such
i
take
you
to
be
by
your
voice
i
have
fallen
into
this
pond
and
know
not
how
to
get
out
again
as
i
am
quite
blind
and
i
am
almost
afraid
to
move
for
fear
of
being
drowned
said
the
little
boy
i
shall
be
wetted
to
the
skin
if
you
will
throw
me
your
stick
i
will
try
to
help
you
out
of
it
the
blind
man
then
threw
the
stick
to
that
side
on
which
he
heard
the
voice
the
little
boy
caught
it
and
went
into
the
water
feeling
very
carefully
before
him
lest
he
should
unguardedly
go
beyond
his
depth
at
length
he
reached
the
blind
man
took
him
very
carefully
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out
the
blind
man
then
gave
him
a
thousand
blessings
and
told
him
he
could
grope
out
his
way
home
and
the
little
boy
ran
on
as
hard
as
he
could
to
prevent
being
benighted
but
he
had
not
proceeded
far
before
he
saw
a
poor
sailor
who
had
lost
both
his
legs
in
an
engagement
by
sea
hopping
along
upon
crutches
bless
you
my
little
master
said
the
sailor
have
fought
many
a
battle
with
the
french
to
defend
poor
old
england
but
now
i
am
crippled
as
you
see
and
have
neither
victuals
nor
money
although
i
am
almost
famished
the
little
boy
could
not
resist
the
inclination
to
relieve
him
so
he
gave
him
all
his
remaining
victuals
and
said
help
you
poor
man
this
is
all
i
have
otherwise
you
should
have
more
he
then
ran
along
and
presently
arrived
at
the
town
he
was
going
to
did
his
business
and
returned
towards
his
own
home
with
all
the
expedition
he
was
able
but
he
had
not
gone
much
more
than
before
the
night
shut
in
extremely
dark
without
either
moon
or
stars
to
light
him
the
poor
little
boy
used
his
utmost
endeavours
to
find
his
way
but
unfortunately
missed
it
in
turning
down
a
lane
which
brought
him
into
a
wood
where
he
wandered
about
a
great
while
without
being
able
to
find
any
path
to
lead
him
out
tired
out
at
last
and
hungry
he
felt
himself
so
feeble
that
he
could
go
no
farther
but
set
himself
down
upon
the
ground
crying
most
bitterly
in
this
situation
he
remained
for
some
time
till
at
last
the
little
dog
who
had
never
forsaken
him
came
up
to
him
wagging
his
tail
and
holding
something
in
his
mouth
the
little
boy
took
it
from
him
and
saw
it
was
a
handkerchief
nicely
pinned
together
which
somebody
had
dropped
and
the
dog
had
picked
up
and
on
opening
it
he
found
several
slices
of
bread
and
meat
which
the
little
boy
ate
with
great
satisfaction
and
felt
himself
extremely
refreshed
with
his
meal
said
the
little
boy
see
that
if
i
have
given
you
a
breakfast
you
have
given
me
a
supper
and
a
good
turn
is
never
lost
done
even
to
a
dog
he
then
once
more
attempted
to
escape
from
the
wood
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
he
only
scratched
his
legs
with
briers
and
slipped
down
in
the
dirt
without
being
able
to
find
his
way
out
he
was
just
going
to
give
up
all
further
attempts
in
despair
when
he
happened
to
see
a
horse
feeding
before
him
and
going
up
to
him
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
just
then
began
to
shine
a
little
that
it
was
the
very
same
he
had
fed
in
the
morning
said
the
little
boy
creature
as
i
have
been
so
good
to
him
will
let
me
get
upon
his
back
and
he
may
bring
me
out
of
the
wood
as
he
is
accustomed
to
feed
in
this
neighbourhood
the
little
boy
then
went
up
to
the
horse
speaking
to
him
and
stroking
him
and
the
horse
let
him
mount
his
back
without
opposition
and
then
proceeded
slowly
through
the
wood
grazing
as
he
went
till
he
brought
him
to
an
opening
which
led
to
the
high
road
the
little
boy
was
much
rejoiced
at
this
and
said
i
had
not
saved
this
creature
life
in
the
morning
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
have
stayed
here
all
night
i
see
by
this
that
a
good
turn
is
never
lost
but
the
poor
little
boy
had
yet
a
greater
danger
to
undergo
for
as
he
was
going
down
a
solitary
lane
two
men
rushed
out
upon
him
laid
hold
of
him
and
were
going
to
strip
him
of
his
clothes
but
just
as
they
were
beginning
to
do
it
the
little
dog
bit
the
leg
of
one
of
the
men
with
so
much
violence
that
he
left
the
little
boy
and
pursued
the
dog
that
ran
howling
and
barking
away
in
this
instant
a
voice
was
hard
that
cried
out
the
rascals
are
let
us
knock
them
down
which
frightened
the
remaining
man
so
much
that
he
ran
away
and
his
companion
followed
him
the
little
boy
then
looked
up
and
saw
it
was
the
sailor
whom
he
had
relieved
in
the
morning
carried
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
blind
man
whom
he
had
helped
out
of
the
pond
my
little
dear
said
the
sailor
be
thanked
we
have
come
in
time
to
do
you
a
service
in
return
for
what
you
did
us
in
the
morning
as
i
lay
under
a
hedge
i
heard
these
villains
talk
of
robbing
a
little
boy
who
from
the
description
i
concluded
must
be
you
but
i
was
so
lame
that
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
come
time
enough
to
help
you
if
i
had
not
meet
this
honest
blind
man
who
took
me
upon
his
back
while
i
showed
him
the
way
the
little
boy
thanked
him
very
sincerely
for
thus
defending
him
and
they
went
all
together
to
his
father
house
which
was
not
far
off
where
they
were
all
kindly
entertained
with
a
supper
and
a
bed
the
little
boy
took
care
of
his
faithful
dog
as
long
as
he
lived
and
never
forgot
the
importance
and
necessity
of
doing
good
to
others
if
we
wish
them
to
do
the
same
to
us
upon
my
word
said
tommy
when
he
had
finished
i
am
vastly
pleased
with
this
story
and
i
think
that
it
may
very
likely
be
true
for
i
have
myself
observed
that
everything
seems
to
love
little
harry
here
merely
because
he
is
to
it
i
was
much
surprised
to
see
the
great
dog
the
other
day
which
i
have
never
dared
to
touch
for
fear
of
being
bitten
fawning
upon
him
and
licking
him
all
over
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
story
of
androcles
and
the
lion
that
dog
said
mr
barlow
will
be
equally
fond
of
you
if
you
are
kind
to
him
for
nothing
equals
the
sagacity
and
gratitude
of
a
dog
but
since
you
have
read
a
story
about
a
boy
harry
shall
read
you
another
concerning
a
boy
of
a
contrary
disposition
harry
read
the
following
story
of
the
boy
there
was
once
a
little
boy
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
a
very
bad
man
for
his
father
who
was
always
surly
and
and
never
gave
his
children
either
good
instructions
or
good
example
in
consequence
of
which
this
little
boy
who
might
otherwise
have
been
happier
and
better
became
quarrelsome
and
disagreeable
to
everybody
he
very
often
was
severely
beaten
for
his
impertinence
by
boys
that
were
bigger
than
himself
and
sometimes
by
boys
that
were
less
for
though
he
was
very
abusive
and
quarrelsome
he
did
not
much
like
fighting
and
generally
trusted
more
to
his
heels
than
his
courage
when
he
had
engaged
himself
in
a
quarrel
this
little
boy
had
a
that
was
the
exact
image
of
himself
he
was
the
most
troublesome
surly
creature
imaginable
always
barking
at
the
heels
of
every
horse
he
came
near
and
worrying
every
sheep
he
could
meet
with
for
which
reason
both
the
dog
and
the
boy
were
disliked
by
all
the
neighbourhood
one
morning
his
father
got
up
early
to
go
to
the
alehouse
where
he
intended
to
stay
till
night
as
it
was
a
holiday
but
before
he
went
out
he
gave
his
son
some
bread
and
cold
meat
and
sixpence
and
told
him
he
might
go
and
divert
himself
as
he
would
the
whole
day
the
little
boy
was
much
pleased
with
this
liberty
and
as
it
was
a
very
fine
morning
he
called
his
dog
tiger
to
follow
him
and
began
his
walk
he
had
not
proceeded
far
before
he
met
a
little
boy
that
was
driving
a
flock
of
sheep
towards
a
gate
that
he
wanted
them
to
enter
master
said
the
little
boy
still
and
keep
your
dog
close
to
you
for
fear
you
frighten
my
sheep
yes
to
be
sure
answered
the
boy
am
to
wait
here
all
the
morning
till
you
and
your
sheep
have
passed
i
suppose
here
tiger
seize
them
boy
tiger
at
this
sprang
forth
into
the
middle
of
the
flock
barking
and
biting
on
every
side
and
the
sheep
in
a
general
consternation
hurried
each
a
separate
way
tiger
seemed
to
enjoy
this
sport
equally
with
his
master
but
in
the
midst
of
his
triumph
he
happened
unguardedly
to
attack
an
old
ram
that
had
more
courage
than
the
rest
of
the
flock
he
instead
of
running
away
faced
about
and
aimed
a
blow
with
his
forehead
at
his
enemy
with
so
much
force
and
dexterity
that
he
knocked
tiger
over
and
over
and
butting
him
several
times
while
he
was
down
obliged
him
to
limp
howling
away
the
little
boy
who
was
not
capable
of
loving
anything
had
been
much
diverted
with
the
trepidation
of
the
sheep
but
now
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
misfortune
of
his
dog
and
he
would
have
laughed
much
longer
had
not
the
other
little
boy
provoked
beyond
his
patience
at
this
treatment
thrown
a
stone
at
him
which
hit
him
full
upon
the
temples
and
almost
knocked
him
down
he
immediately
began
to
cry
in
concert
with
his
dog
and
perceiving
a
man
coming
towards
them
who
he
fancied
might
be
the
owner
of
the
sheep
he
thought
it
most
prudent
to
escape
as
speedily
as
possible
but
he
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
smart
which
the
blow
had
occasioned
before
his
former
mischievous
disposition
returned
which
he
determined
to
gratify
to
the
utmost
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
saw
a
little
girl
standing
by
a
stile
with
a
large
pot
of
milk
at
her
feet
said
the
little
girl
me
up
with
this
pot
of
milk
my
mother
sent
me
out
to
fetch
it
this
morning
and
i
have
brought
it
above
a
mile
upon
my
head
but
i
am
so
tired
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
stop
at
this
stile
to
rest
me
and
if
i
do
return
home
presently
we
shall
have
no
pudding
and
besides
my
mother
will
be
very
angry
with
me
said
the
boy
are
to
have
a
pudding
are
you
miss
said
the
girl
a
fine
piece
of
for
there
uncle
will
and
uncle
john
and
grandfather
and
all
my
cousins
to
dine
with
us
and
we
shall
be
very
merry
in
the
evening
i
can
assure
you
so
pray
help
me
up
as
speedily
as
possible
i
will
miss
said
the
boy
and
taking
up
the
jug
he
pretended
to
fix
it
upon
her
head
but
as
she
had
hold
of
it
he
gave
it
a
little
push
as
if
he
had
stumbled
and
overturned
it
upon
her
the
little
girl
began
to
cry
violently
but
the
mischievous
boy
ran
away
laughing
heartily
and
saying
little
miss
give
my
humble
service
to
uncle
will
and
grandfather
and
the
dear
little
cousins
this
prank
encouraged
him
very
much
for
he
thought
he
had
now
certainly
escaped
without
any
bad
consequences
so
he
went
on
applauding
his
own
ingenuity
and
came
to
a
green
where
several
little
boys
were
at
play
he
desired
leave
to
play
with
them
which
they
allowed
him
to
do
but
he
could
not
be
contented
long
without
exerting
his
evil
disposition
so
taking
an
opportunity
when
it
was
his
turn
to
fling
the
ball
instead
of
flinging
it
the
way
he
ought
to
have
done
he
threw
it
into
a
deep
muddy
ditch
the
little
boys
ran
in
a
great
hurry
to
see
what
was
become
of
it
and
as
they
were
standing
together
upon
the
brink
he
gave
the
outermost
boy
a
violent
push
against
his
neighbour
he
not
being
able
to
resist
the
violence
tumbled
against
another
by
which
means
they
were
all
soused
into
the
ditch
together
they
soon
scrambled
out
although
in
a
dirty
plight
and
were
going
to
have
punished
him
for
his
ill
behaviour
but
he
patted
tiger
upon
the
back
who
began
snarling
and
growling
in
such
a
manner
as
made
them
desist
thus
this
mischievous
little
boy
escaped
a
second
time
with
impunity
the
next
thing
that
he
met
with
was
a
poor
jackass
feeding
very
quietly
in
a
ditch
the
little
boy
seeing
that
nobody
was
within
sight
thought
this
was
an
opportunity
of
plaguing
an
animal
that
was
not
to
be
lost
so
he
went
and
cut
a
large
bunch
of
thorns
which
he
contrived
to
fix
upon
the
poor
beast
tail
and
then
setting
tiger
at
him
he
was
extremely
diverted
to
see
the
fright
and
agony
the
creature
was
in
but
it
did
not
fare
so
well
with
tiger
who
while
he
was
baying
and
biting
the
animal
heels
received
so
severe
a
kick
upon
his
forehead
as
laid
him
dead
upon
the
spot
the
boy
who
had
no
affection
for
his
dog
left
him
with
the
greatest
unconcern
when
he
saw
what
had
happened
and
finding
himself
hungry
sat
down
by
the
wayside
to
eat
his
dinner
he
had
not
been
long
there
before
a
poor
blind
man
came
groping
his
way
out
with
a
couple
of
sticks
morning
to
you
gaffer
said
the
boy
did
you
see
a
little
girl
come
this
road
with
a
basket
of
eggs
upon
her
head
dressed
in
a
green
gown
with
a
straw
hat
upon
her
head
bless
you
master
said
the
beggar
am
so
blind
that
i
can
see
nothing
i
have
been
blind
these
twenty
years
and
they
call
me
poor
old
blind
richard
though
this
poor
man
was
such
an
object
of
charity
and
compassion
yet
the
little
boy
determined
as
usual
to
play
him
some
trick
and
as
he
was
a
great
liar
and
deceiver
he
spoke
to
him
thus
old
richard
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
you
with
all
my
heart
i
am
just
eating
my
breakfast
and
if
you
will
sit
down
by
me
i
will
give
you
part
and
feed
you
myself
you
with
all
my
heart
said
the
poor
man
if
you
will
give
me
your
hand
i
will
sit
by
you
with
great
pleasure
my
dear
good
little
master
the
little
boy
then
gave
him
his
hand
and
pretending
to
direct
him
guided
him
to
sit
down
in
a
large
heap
of
wet
dung
that
lay
by
the
said
he
you
are
nicely
seated
and
i
will
feed
you
so
taking
a
little
in
his
fingers
he
was
going
to
put
it
into
the
blind
man
mouth
but
the
man
who
now
perceived
the
trick
that
had
been
played
him
made
a
sudden
snap
at
his
fingers
and
getting
them
between
his
teeth
bit
them
so
severely
that
the
wicked
boy
roared
out
for
mercy
and
promised
never
more
to
be
guilty
of
such
wickedness
at
last
the
blind
man
after
he
had
put
him
to
very
severe
pain
consented
to
let
him
go
saying
as
he
went
you
not
ashamed
you
little
scoundrel
to
attempt
to
do
hurt
to
those
who
have
never
injured
you
and
to
want
to
add
to
the
sufferings
of
those
who
are
already
sufficiently
miserable
although
you
escape
now
be
assured
that
if
you
do
not
repent
and
mend
your
manners
you
will
meet
with
a
severe
punishment
for
your
bad
behaviour
one
would
think
that
this
punishment
should
have
cured
him
entirely
of
his
mischievous
disposition
but
unfortunately
nothing
is
so
difficult
to
overcome
as
bad
habits
that
have
been
long
indulged
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
saw
a
lame
beggar
that
just
made
a
shift
to
support
himself
by
means
of
a
couple
of
sticks
the
beggar
asked
him
to
give
him
something
and
the
little
mischievous
boy
pulling
out
his
sixpence
threw
it
down
just
before
him
as
if
he
intended
to
make
him
a
present
of
it
but
while
the
poor
man
was
stooping
with
difficulty
to
pick
it
up
this
wicked
little
boy
knocked
the
stick
away
by
which
means
the
beggar
fell
down
upon
his
face
and
then
snatching
up
the
sixpence
the
boy
ran
away
laughing
very
heartily
at
the
accident
this
was
the
last
trick
this
ungracious
boy
had
it
in
his
power
to
play
for
seeing
two
men
come
up
to
the
beggar
and
enter
into
discourse
with
him
he
was
afraid
of
being
pursued
and
therefore
ran
as
fast
as
he
was
able
over
several
fields
at
last
he
came
into
a
lane
which
led
into
a
farmer
orchard
and
as
he
was
preparing
to
clamber
over
the
fence
a
large
dog
seized
him
by
the
leg
and
held
him
fast
he
cried
out
in
agony
of
terror
which
brought
the
farmer
out
who
called
the
dog
off
but
seized
him
very
roughly
saying
sir
you
are
caught
at
last
are
you
you
thought
you
might
come
day
after
day
and
steal
my
apples
without
detection
but
it
seems
you
are
mistaken
and
now
you
shall
receive
the
punishment
you
have
so
long
deserved
the
farmer
then
began
to
chastise
him
very
severely
with
a
whip
he
had
in
his
hand
and
the
boy
in
vain
protested
he
was
innocent
and
begged
for
mercy
at
last
the
farmer
asked
him
who
he
was
and
where
he
lived
but
when
he
heard
his
name
he
cried
out
are
you
the
little
rascal
that
frightened
my
sheep
this
morning
by
which
means
several
of
them
are
lost
and
do
you
think
to
escape
saying
this
he
lashed
him
more
severely
than
before
in
spite
of
all
his
cries
and
protestations
at
length
thinking
he
had
punished
him
enough
he
turned
him
out
of
the
orchard
bade
him
go
home
and
frighten
sheep
again
if
he
liked
the
consequences
the
little
boy
slunk
away
crying
very
bitterly
for
he
had
been
very
severely
beaten
and
now
began
to
find
that
no
one
can
long
hurt
others
with
impunity
so
he
determined
to
go
quietly
home
and
behave
better
for
the
future
but
his
sufferings
were
not
yet
at
an
end
for
as
he
jumped
down
from
a
stile
he
felt
himself
very
roughly
seized
and
looking
up
found
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
the
lame
beggar
whom
he
had
thrown
upon
his
face
it
was
in
vain
that
he
now
cried
entreated
and
begged
pardon
the
man
who
had
been
much
hurt
by
his
fall
thrashed
him
very
severely
with
his
stick
before
he
would
part
with
him
he
now
again
went
on
crying
and
roaring
with
pain
but
at
least
expected
to
escape
without
further
damage
but
here
he
was
mistaken
for
as
he
was
walking
slowly
through
a
lane
just
as
he
turned
a
corner
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
very
troop
of
boys
that
he
had
used
so
ill
in
the
morning
they
all
set
up
a
shout
as
soon
as
they
saw
their
enemy
in
their
power
without
his
dog
and
began
persecuting
him
a
thousand
various
ways
some
pulled
him
by
the
hair
others
pinched
him
some
whipped
his
legs
with
their
handkerchiefs
while
others
covered
him
with
handfuls
of
dirt
in
vain
did
he
attempt
to
escape
they
were
still
at
his
heels
and
surrounding
him
on
every
side
continued
their
persecutions
at
length
while
he
was
in
this
disagreeable
situation
he
happened
to
come
up
to
the
same
jackass
he
had
seen
in
the
morning
and
making
a
sudden
spring
jumped
upon
his
back
hoping
by
these
means
to
escape
the
boys
immediately
renewed
their
shouts
and
the
ass
who
was
frightened
at
the
noise
began
galloping
with
all
his
might
and
presently
bore
him
from
the
reach
of
his
enemies
but
he
had
but
little
reason
to
rejoice
at
this
escape
for
he
found
it
impossible
to
stop
the
animal
and
was
every
instant
afraid
of
being
thrown
of
and
dashed
upon
the
ground
after
he
had
been
thus
hurried
along
a
considerable
time
the
ass
on
a
sudden
stopped
short
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
and
began
kicking
and
prancing
with
so
much
fury
that
the
little
boy
was
presently
thrown
to
the
ground
and
broke
his
leg
in
the
fall
his
cries
immediately
brought
the
family
out
among
whom
was
the
very
little
girl
he
had
used
so
ill
in
the
morning
but
she
with
the
greatest
seeing
him
in
such
a
pitiable
situation
assisted
in
bringing
him
in
and
laying
him
upon
the
bed
there
this
unfortunate
boy
had
leisure
to
recollect
himself
and
reflect
upon
his
own
bad
behaviour
which
in
one
day
time
had
exposed
him
to
such
a
variety
of
misfortunes
and
he
determined
with
great
sincerity
that
if
ever
he
recovered
from
his
present
accident
he
would
be
as
careful
to
take
every
opportunity
of
doing
good
as
he
had
before
been
to
commit
every
species
of
mischief
when
the
story
was
ended
tommy
said
it
was
very
surprising
to
see
how
differently
the
two
little
boys
fared
the
one
little
boy
was
and
therefore
everything
he
met
became
his
friend
and
assisted
him
in
return
the
other
who
was
made
everything
his
enemy
and
therefore
he
met
with
nothing
but
misfortunes
and
vexations
and
nobody
seemed
to
feel
any
compassion
for
him
excepting
the
poor
little
girl
that
assisted
him
at
last
which
was
very
kind
indeed
of
her
considering
how
ill
she
had
been
used
that
is
very
true
indeed
said
mr
barlow
nobody
is
loved
in
this
world
unless
he
loves
others
and
does
good
to
them
and
nobody
can
tell
but
one
time
or
other
he
may
want
the
assistance
of
the
meanest
and
lowest
therefore
every
sensible
man
will
behave
well
to
everything
around
him
he
will
behave
well
because
it
is
his
duty
to
do
it
because
every
benevolent
person
feels
the
greatest
pleasure
in
doing
good
and
even
because
it
is
his
own
interest
to
make
as
many
friends
as
possible
no
one
can
tell
however
secure
his
present
situation
may
appear
how
soon
it
may
alter
and
he
may
have
occasion
for
the
compassion
of
those
who
are
now
infinitely
below
him
i
could
show
you
a
story
to
that
purpose
but
you
have
read
enough
and
therefore
you
must
now
go
out
and
use
some
exercise
oh
pray
sir
said
tommy
do
let
me
hear
the
story
i
think
i
could
now
read
for
ever
without
being
tired
no
said
mr
barlow
everything
has
its
turn
you
shall
read
but
now
we
must
work
in
the
garden
then
pray
sir
said
tommy
may
i
ask
a
favour
of
you
surely
answered
mr
barlow
if
it
is
proper
for
you
to
have
there
is
nothing
can
give
me
a
greater
pleasure
than
to
grant
it
why
then
said
tommy
i
have
been
thinking
that
a
man
should
know
how
to
do
everything
in
the
world
very
right
the
more
knowledge
he
acquires
the
better
and
therefore
harry
and
i
are
going
to
build
a
house
to
build
a
house
well
and
have
you
laid
in
a
sufficient
quantity
of
brick
and
mortar
no
no
said
tommy
smiling
harry
and
i
can
build
houses
without
brick
and
mortar
what
are
they
to
be
made
of
then
cards
dear
sir
answered
tommy
do
you
think
we
are
such
little
children
as
to
want
no
we
are
going
to
build
real
houses
fit
for
people
to
live
in
and
then
you
know
if
ever
we
should
be
thrown
upon
a
desert
coast
as
the
poor
men
were
we
shall
be
able
to
supply
ourselves
with
necessaries
till
some
ship
comes
to
take
us
away
and
if
no
ship
should
come
what
then
why
then
we
must
stay
there
all
our
lives
i
am
afraid
if
you
wish
to
prepare
yourselves
against
the
event
you
are
much
in
the
right
for
nobody
knows
what
may
happen
to
him
in
this
world
what
is
it
then
you
want
to
make
your
house
the
first
thing
we
want
sir
is
wood
and
a
hatchet
wood
you
shall
have
in
plenty
but
did
you
ever
use
a
hatchet
no
sir
then
i
am
afraid
to
let
you
have
one
because
it
is
a
very
dangerous
kind
of
tool
and
if
you
are
not
expert
in
the
use
of
it
you
may
wound
yourself
severely
but
if
you
will
let
me
know
what
you
want
i
who
am
more
strong
and
expert
will
take
the
hatchet
and
cut
down
the
wood
for
you
thank
you
sir
said
tommy
you
are
very
good
to
me
indeed
and
away
harry
and
he
ran
to
the
copse
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
mr
barlow
then
went
to
work
and
presently
by
harry
direction
cut
down
several
poles
about
as
thick
as
a
man
wrist
and
about
eight
feet
long
these
he
sharpened
at
the
end
in
order
to
run
into
the
ground
and
so
eager
were
the
two
little
boys
at
the
business
that
in
a
very
short
time
they
had
transported
them
all
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
tommy
entirely
forgot
he
was
a
gentleman
and
worked
with
the
greatest
eagerness
now
said
mr
barlow
where
will
you
fix
your
house
here
i
think
answered
tommy
just
at
the
bottom
of
this
hill
because
it
will
be
warm
and
sheltered
so
harry
took
the
stakes
and
began
to
thrust
them
into
the
ground
at
about
the
distance
of
a
foot
and
in
this
manner
he
enclosed
a
piece
of
ground
which
was
about
ten
feet
long
and
eight
feet
wide
leaving
an
opening
in
the
middle
of
three
feet
wide
for
a
door
after
this
was
done
they
gathered
up
the
brushwood
that
was
cut
off
and
by
direction
they
interwove
it
between
the
poles
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
compact
kind
of
fence
this
labour
as
may
be
imagined
took
them
up
several
days
however
they
worked
at
it
very
hard
every
day
and
every
day
the
work
advanced
which
filled
tommy
heart
with
so
much
pleasure
that
he
thought
himself
the
happiest
little
boy
in
the
universe
but
this
employment
did
not
make
tommy
unmindful
of
the
story
which
mr
barlow
had
promised
him
it
was
to
this
purport
the
story
of
the
grateful
turk
it
is
too
much
to
be
lamented
that
different
nations
frequently
make
bloody
wars
with
each
other
and
when
they
take
any
of
their
enemies
prisoners
instead
of
using
them
well
and
restoring
them
to
liberty
they
confine
them
in
prisons
or
sell
them
as
slaves
the
enmity
that
there
is
often
between
many
of
the
italian
states
particularly
the
venetians
and
the
turks
is
sufficiently
known
it
once
happened
that
a
venetian
ship
had
taken
many
of
the
turks
prisoners
and
according
to
the
barbarous
customs
i
have
mentioned
these
unhappy
men
had
been
sold
to
different
persons
in
the
city
by
accident
one
of
the
slaves
lived
opposite
to
the
house
of
a
rich
venetian
who
had
an
only
son
of
about
the
age
of
twelve
years
it
happened
that
this
little
boy
used
frequently
to
stop
as
he
passed
near
hamet
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
slave
and
gaze
at
him
very
attentively
hamet
who
remarked
in
the
face
of
the
child
the
appearance
of
and
compassion
used
always
to
salute
him
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
testified
the
greatest
pleasure
in
his
company
at
length
the
little
boy
took
such
a
fancy
to
the
slave
that
he
used
to
visit
him
several
times
in
the
day
and
brought
him
such
little
presents
as
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
and
which
he
thought
would
be
of
use
to
his
friend
but
though
hamet
seemed
always
to
take
the
greatest
delight
in
the
innocent
caresses
of
his
little
friend
yet
the
child
could
not
help
remarking
that
hamet
was
frequently
extremely
sorrowful
and
he
often
surprised
him
on
a
sudden
when
tears
were
trickling
down
his
face
although
he
did
his
utmost
to
conceal
them
the
little
boy
was
at
length
so
much
affected
with
the
repetition
of
this
sight
that
he
spoke
of
it
to
his
father
and
begged
him
if
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
poor
hamet
happy
the
father
who
was
extremely
fond
of
his
son
and
besides
had
observed
that
he
seldom
requested
anything
which
was
not
generous
and
humane
determined
to
see
the
turk
himself
and
talk
to
him
accordingly
he
went
to
him
the
next
day
and
observing
him
for
some
time
in
silence
was
struck
with
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
mildness
and
honesty
which
his
countenance
discovered
at
length
he
said
to
him
you
that
hamet
of
whom
my
son
is
so
fond
and
of
whose
gentleness
and
courtesy
i
have
so
often
heard
him
talk
said
the
turk
am
that
unfortunate
hamet
who
have
now
been
for
three
years
a
captive
during
that
space
of
time
your
son
if
you
are
his
father
is
the
only
human
being
that
seems
to
have
felt
any
compassion
for
my
sufferings
therefore
i
must
confess
he
is
the
only
object
to
which
i
am
attached
in
this
barbarous
country
and
night
and
morning
i
pray
that
power
who
is
equally
the
god
of
turks
and
christians
to
grant
him
every
blessing
he
deserves
and
to
preserve
him
from
all
the
miseries
i
suffer
hamet
said
the
merchant
is
much
obliged
to
you
although
from
his
present
circumstances
he
does
not
appear
much
exposed
to
danger
but
tell
me
for
i
wish
to
do
you
good
in
what
can
i
assist
you
for
my
son
informs
me
that
you
are
the
prey
of
continual
regret
and
sorrow
it
wonderful
answered
the
turk
with
a
glow
of
generous
indignation
that
suddenly
animated
his
countenance
it
wonderful
that
i
should
pine
in
silence
and
mourn
my
fate
who
am
bereft
of
the
first
and
noblest
present
of
nature
my
liberty
yet
answered
the
venetian
many
thousands
of
our
nation
do
you
retain
in
fetters
am
not
answerable
said
the
turk
the
cruelty
of
my
countrymen
more
than
you
are
for
the
barbarity
of
yours
but
as
to
myself
i
have
never
practised
the
inhuman
custom
of
enslaving
my
fellow
creatures
i
have
never
spoiled
the
venetian
merchants
of
their
property
to
increase
my
riches
i
have
always
respected
the
rights
of
nature
and
therefore
it
is
the
more
severe
here
a
tear
started
from
his
eye
and
wetted
his
manly
cheek
instantly
however
he
recollected
himself
and
folding
his
arm
upon
his
bosom
and
gently
bowing
his
head
he
added
is
good
and
man
must
submit
to
his
decrees
the
venetian
was
affected
with
this
appearance
of
manly
fortitude
and
said
i
pity
your
sufferings
and
may
perhaps
be
able
to
relieve
them
what
would
you
do
to
regain
your
liberty
would
i
do
answered
hamet
the
eternal
majesty
of
heaven
i
would
confront
every
pain
and
danger
that
can
appal
the
heart
of
man
answered
the
merchant
will
not
be
exposed
to
a
trial
the
means
of
your
deliverance
are
certain
provided
your
courage
does
not
belie
your
appearance
them
name
them
cried
the
impatient
hamet
death
before
me
in
every
horrid
shape
and
if
i
shrink
answered
the
merchant
shall
be
observed
but
hear
me
attentively
i
have
in
this
city
an
inveterate
foe
who
has
heaped
upon
me
every
injury
which
can
most
bitterly
sting
the
heart
of
man
this
man
is
brave
as
he
is
haughty
and
i
must
confess
that
the
dread
of
his
strength
and
valour
has
hitherto
deterred
me
from
resenting
his
insults
as
they
deserve
now
hamet
your
look
your
form
your
words
convince
me
that
you
were
born
for
manly
daring
take
this
dagger
as
soon
as
the
shades
of
night
involve
the
city
i
will
myself
conduct
you
to
the
place
where
you
may
at
once
revenge
your
friend
and
regain
your
freedom
at
this
proposal
scorn
and
shame
flashed
from
the
kindling
eye
of
hamet
and
passion
for
a
considerable
time
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
utterance
at
length
he
lifted
his
arm
as
high
as
his
chains
would
permit
and
cried
with
an
indignant
tone
prophet
and
are
these
the
wretches
to
whom
you
permit
your
faithful
votaries
to
be
enslaved
go
base
christian
and
know
that
hamet
would
not
stoop
to
the
vile
trade
of
an
assassin
for
all
the
wealth
of
venice
no
not
to
purchase
the
freedom
of
all
his
race
at
these
words
the
merchant
without
seeming
much
abashed
told
him
he
was
sorry
he
had
offended
him
but
that
he
thought
freedom
had
been
dearer
to
him
than
he
found
it
was
added
he
as
he
turned
his
back
will
reflect
upon
my
proposal
and
perhaps
by
you
may
change
your
mind
hamet
disdained
to
answer
and
the
merchant
went
his
way
the
next
day
however
he
returned
in
company
with
his
son
and
mildly
accosted
hamet
thus
abruptness
of
the
proposal
i
yesterday
made
you
might
perhaps
astonish
you
but
i
am
now
come
to
discourse
the
matter
more
calmly
with
you
and
i
doubt
not
when
you
have
heard
my
reasons
interrupted
hamet
with
a
severe
but
composed
countenance
at
length
to
insult
the
miserable
with
proposals
more
shocking
than
even
these
chains
if
thy
religion
permit
such
acts
as
those
know
that
they
are
execrable
and
abominable
to
the
soul
of
every
mohammedan
therefore
from
this
moment
let
us
break
off
all
further
intercourse
and
be
strangers
to
each
other
answered
the
merchant
flinging
himself
into
the
arms
of
hamet
us
from
this
moment
be
more
closely
linked
than
ever
generous
man
whose
virtues
may
at
once
disarm
and
enlighten
thy
enemies
fondness
for
my
son
first
made
me
interested
in
thy
fate
but
from
the
moment
that
i
saw
thee
yesterday
i
determined
to
set
thee
free
therefore
pardon
me
this
unnecessary
trial
of
thy
virtue
which
has
only
raised
thee
higher
in
my
esteem
francisco
has
a
soul
which
is
as
averse
to
deeds
of
treachery
and
blood
as
even
hamet
himself
from
this
moment
generous
man
thou
art
free
thy
ransom
is
already
paid
with
no
other
obligation
than
that
of
remembering
the
affection
of
this
thy
young
and
faithful
friend
and
perhaps
hereafter
when
thou
seest
an
unhappy
christian
groaning
in
turkish
fetters
thy
generosity
may
make
thee
think
of
venice
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
ecstasies
or
the
gratitude
of
hamet
at
this
unexpected
deliverance
i
will
not
therefore
attempt
to
repeat
what
he
said
to
his
benefactors
i
will
only
add
that
he
was
that
day
set
free
and
francisco
embarked
him
on
board
a
ship
which
was
going
to
one
of
the
grecian
islands
took
leave
of
him
with
the
greatest
tenderness
and
forced
him
to
accept
a
purse
of
gold
to
pay
his
expenses
nor
was
it
without
the
greatest
regret
that
hamet
parted
from
his
young
friend
whose
disinterested
kindness
had
thus
procured
his
freedom
he
embraced
him
with
an
agony
of
tenderness
wept
over
him
at
parting
and
prayed
for
every
blessing
upon
his
head
about
six
months
after
this
transaction
a
sudden
fire
burst
forth
in
the
house
of
this
generous
merchant
it
was
early
in
the
morning
when
sleep
is
the
most
profound
and
none
of
the
family
perceived
it
till
almost
the
whole
building
was
involved
in
flames
the
frightened
servants
had
just
time
to
waken
the
merchant
and
hurry
him
down
stairs
and
the
instant
he
was
down
the
staircase
itself
gave
way
and
sunk
with
a
horrid
crash
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
but
if
francisco
congratulated
himself
for
an
instant
upon
his
escape
it
was
only
to
resign
himself
immediately
after
to
the
most
deep
despair
when
he
found
upon
inquiry
that
his
son
who
slept
in
an
upper
apartment
had
been
neglected
in
the
general
tumult
and
was
yet
amidst
the
flames
no
words
can
describe
the
father
agony
he
would
have
rushed
headlong
into
the
fire
but
was
restrained
by
his
servants
he
then
raved
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
offered
half
his
fortune
to
the
intrepid
man
who
would
risk
his
life
to
save
his
child
as
francisco
was
known
to
be
immensely
rich
several
ladders
were
in
an
instant
raised
and
several
daring
spirits
incited
by
the
vast
reward
attempted
the
adventure
the
violence
of
the
flames
however
which
burst
forth
at
every
window
together
with
the
ruins
that
fell
on
every
side
drove
them
all
back
and
the
unfortunate
youth
who
now
appeared
upon
the
battlements
stretching
out
his
arms
and
imploring
aid
seemed
to
be
destined
to
certain
destruction
the
unhappy
father
now
lost
all
perception
and
sunk
down
in
a
state
of
insensibility
when
in
this
dreadful
moment
of
general
suspense
and
agony
a
man
rushed
through
the
opening
crowd
mounted
the
tallest
of
the
ladders
with
an
intrepidity
that
showed
he
was
resolved
to
succeed
or
perish
and
instantly
disappeared
a
sudden
gust
of
smoke
and
flame
burst
forth
immediately
after
which
made
the
people
imagine
he
was
lost
when
on
a
sudden
they
beheld
him
emerge
again
with
the
child
in
his
arms
and
descend
the
ladder
without
any
material
damage
a
universal
shout
of
applause
now
resounded
to
the
skies
but
what
words
can
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
father
feelings
when
on
recovering
his
senses
he
found
his
darling
miraculously
preserved
and
safe
within
his
arms
after
the
first
effusions
of
his
tenderness
were
over
he
asked
for
his
deliverer
and
was
shown
a
man
of
a
noble
stature
but
dressed
in
mean
attire
and
his
features
were
so
begrimed
with
smoke
and
filth
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
them
francisco
however
accosted
him
with
courtesy
and
presenting
him
with
a
purse
of
gold
begged
he
would
accept
of
that
for
the
present
and
that
the
next
day
he
should
receive
to
the
utmost
of
his
promised
reward
generous
merchant
answered
the
stranger
do
not
sell
my
blood
heavens
cried
the
merchant
i
should
know
that
voice
it
is
exclaimed
the
son
throwing
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
deliverer
is
my
hamet
it
was
indeed
hamet
who
stood
before
them
in
the
same
mean
attire
which
he
had
worn
six
months
before
when
the
first
generosity
of
the
merchant
had
redeemed
him
from
slavery
nothing
could
equal
the
astonishment
and
gratitude
of
francisco
but
as
they
were
then
surrounded
by
a
large
concourse
of
people
he
desired
hamet
to
go
with
him
to
the
house
of
one
of
his
friends
and
when
they
were
alone
he
embraced
him
tenderly
and
asked
by
what
extraordinary
chance
he
had
thus
been
enslaved
a
second
time
adding
a
kind
of
reproach
for
his
not
informing
him
of
his
captivity
bless
god
for
that
captivity
answered
hamet
it
has
given
me
an
opportunity
of
showing
that
i
was
not
altogether
undeserving
of
your
kindness
and
of
preserving
the
life
of
that
dear
youth
that
i
value
a
thousand
times
beyond
my
own
but
it
is
now
fit
that
my
generous
patron
should
be
informed
of
the
whole
truth
know
then
that
when
the
unfortunate
hamet
was
taken
by
your
galleys
his
aged
father
shared
his
captivity
it
was
his
fate
which
so
often
made
me
shed
those
tears
which
first
attracted
the
notice
of
your
son
and
when
your
unexampled
bounty
had
set
me
free
i
flew
to
find
the
christian
who
had
purchased
him
i
represented
to
him
that
i
was
young
and
vigorous
while
he
was
aged
and
infirm
i
added
too
the
gold
which
i
had
received
from
your
bounty
in
a
word
i
prevailed
upon
the
christian
to
send
back
my
father
in
that
ship
which
was
intended
for
me
without
acquainting
him
with
the
means
of
his
freedom
since
that
time
i
have
staid
here
to
discharge
the
debt
of
nature
and
gratitude
a
willing
slave
at
this
part
of
the
story
harry
who
had
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
before
burst
into
such
a
fit
of
crying
and
tommy
himself
was
so
much
affected
that
mr
barlow
told
them
they
had
better
leave
off
for
the
present
and
go
to
some
other
employment
they
therefore
went
into
the
garden
to
resume
the
labour
of
their
house
but
found
to
their
unspeakable
regret
that
during
their
absence
an
accident
had
happened
which
had
entirely
destroyed
all
their
labours
a
violent
storm
of
wind
and
rain
had
risen
that
morning
which
blowing
full
against
the
walls
of
the
house
had
levelled
it
with
the
ground
tommy
could
scarcely
refrain
from
crying
when
he
saw
the
ruins
lying
around
but
harry
who
bore
the
loss
with
more
composure
told
him
not
to
mind
it
for
it
could
easily
be
repaired
and
they
would
build
it
stronger
the
next
time
harry
then
went
up
to
the
spot
and
after
examining
it
some
time
told
tommy
that
he
believed
he
had
found
out
the
reason
of
their
misfortune
what
is
it
said
tommy
why
said
harry
it
is
only
because
we
did
not
drive
these
stakes
which
are
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
our
house
far
enough
into
the
ground
and
therefore
when
the
wind
blew
against
the
flat
side
of
it
with
so
much
violence
it
could
not
resist
and
now
i
remember
to
have
seen
the
workman
when
they
begin
a
building
dig
a
considerable
way
into
the
ground
to
lay
the
foundation
fast
and
i
should
think
that
if
we
drove
these
stakes
a
great
way
into
the
ground
it
would
produce
the
same
effect
and
we
should
have
nothing
to
fear
from
any
future
storms
mr
barlow
then
came
into
the
garden
and
the
two
boys
showed
him
their
misfortune
and
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
think
that
driving
the
stakes
further
in
would
prevent
such
an
accident
for
the
future
mr
barlow
told
them
he
thought
it
would
and
that
as
they
were
too
short
to
reach
to
the
top
of
the
stakes
he
would
assist
them
he
then
went
and
brought
a
wooden
mallet
with
which
he
struck
the
tops
of
the
stakes
and
drove
them
so
fast
into
the
ground
that
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
of
their
being
shaken
by
the
weather
harry
and
tommy
then
applied
themselves
with
so
much
assiduity
to
their
work
that
they
in
a
very
short
time
had
repaired
all
the
damage
and
advanced
it
as
far
as
it
had
been
before
the
next
thing
that
was
necessary
to
be
done
was
putting
on
a
roof
for
hitherto
they
had
constructed
nothing
but
the
walls
for
this
purpose
they
took
several
long
poles
which
they
had
laid
across
their
building
where
it
was
most
narrow
and
upon
these
they
placed
straw
in
considerable
quantities
so
that
they
now
imagined
they
had
constructed
a
house
that
would
completely
screen
them
from
the
weather
but
in
this
unfortunately
they
were
again
mistaken
for
a
very
violent
shower
of
rain
coming
just
as
they
had
finished
their
building
they
took
shelter
under
it
and
remarked
for
some
time
with
infinite
pleasure
how
dry
and
comfortable
it
kept
them
but
at
last
the
straw
that
covered
it
being
completely
soaked
through
and
the
water
having
no
vent
to
run
off
by
reason
of
the
flatness
of
the
roof
the
rain
began
to
penetrate
in
considerable
quantities
for
some
time
harry
and
tommy
bore
the
inconvenience
but
it
increased
so
much
that
they
were
soon
obliged
to
leave
it
and
seek
for
shelter
in
the
house
when
they
were
thus
secured
they
began
again
to
consider
the
affair
of
the
house
and
tommy
said
that
it
surely
must
be
because
they
had
not
put
straw
enough
upon
it
no
said
harry
i
think
that
can
not
be
the
reason
i
rather
imagine
that
it
must
be
owing
to
our
roof
lying
so
flat
for
i
have
observed
that
all
houses
that
i
have
ever
seen
have
their
roofs
in
a
shelving
posture
by
which
means
the
wet
continually
runs
off
from
them
and
falls
to
the
ground
whereas
ours
being
quite
flat
detained
almost
all
the
rain
that
fell
upon
it
which
must
necessarily
soak
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
straw
till
it
penetrated
quite
through
they
therefore
agreed
to
remedy
this
defect
and
for
this
purpose
they
took
several
poles
of
an
equal
length
the
one
end
of
which
they
fastened
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
let
the
other
two
ends
meet
in
the
middle
by
which
means
they
formed
a
roof
exactly
like
that
which
we
commonly
see
upon
buildings
they
also
took
several
poles
which
they
tied
across
the
others
to
keep
them
firm
in
their
places
and
give
the
roof
additional
strength
and
lastly
they
covered
the
whole
with
straw
or
thatch
and
for
fear
the
thatch
should
be
blown
away
they
stuck
several
pegs
in
different
places
and
put
small
pieces
of
stick
crosswise
from
peg
to
peg
to
keep
the
straw
in
its
place
when
this
was
done
they
found
they
had
a
very
tolerable
house
only
the
sides
being
formed
of
brushwood
alone
did
not
sufficiently
exclude
the
wind
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
harry
who
was
chief
architect
procured
some
clay
and
mixing
it
up
with
water
to
render
it
sufficiently
soft
he
daubed
it
all
over
the
walls
both
within
and
without
by
which
means
the
wind
was
excluded
and
the
house
rendered
much
warmer
than
before

story
of
a
cure
of
the
gout
some
time
had
now
elapsed
since
the
seeds
of
the
wheat
were
sown
and
they
began
to
shoot
so
vigorously
that
the
blade
of
the
corn
appeared
green
above
the
ground
and
increased
every
day
in
strength
tommy
went
to
look
at
it
every
morning
and
remarked
its
gradual
increase
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
now
said
he
to
harry
i
think
we
should
soon
be
able
to
live
if
we
were
upon
a
desert
island
here
is
a
house
to
shelter
us
from
the
weather
and
we
shall
soon
have
some
corn
for
food
yes
answered
harry
but
there
are
a
great
many
things
still
wanting
to
enable
us
to
make
bread
mr
barlow
had
a
very
large
garden
and
an
orchard
full
of
the
finest
and
he
had
another
piece
of
ground
where
he
used
to
sow
seeds
in
order
to
raise
trees
and
then
they
were
carefully
planted
out
in
beds
till
they
were
big
enough
to
be
moved
into
the
orchard
and
produce
fruit
tommy
had
often
eaten
of
the
fruit
of
the
orchard
and
thought
it
delicious
and
this
led
him
to
think
that
it
would
be
a
great
improvement
to
their
house
if
he
had
a
few
trees
that
he
might
set
near
it
and
which
would
shelter
it
from
the
sun
and
hereafter
produce
fruit
so
he
asked
mr
barlow
to
give
him
a
couple
of
trees
and
mr
barlow
told
him
to
go
into
the
nursery
and
take
his
choice
accordingly
tommy
went
and
chose
out
two
of
the
trees
he
could
find
which
with
harry
assistance
he
transplanted
into
the
garden
in
the
following
manner
they
both
took
their
spades
and
very
carefully
dug
the
trees
up
without
injuring
their
roots
then
they
dug
two
large
holes
in
the
place
where
they
chose
the
trees
should
stand
and
very
carefully
broke
the
earth
to
pieces
that
it
might
lie
light
upon
the
roots
then
the
tree
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
hole
and
tommy
held
it
upright
while
harry
gently
threw
the
earth
over
the
roots
which
he
trod
down
with
his
feet
in
order
to
cover
them
well
lastly
he
stuck
a
large
stake
in
the
ground
and
tied
the
tree
to
it
from
the
fear
that
the
wintry
wind
might
injure
it
or
perhaps
entirely
blow
it
out
of
the
ground
nor
did
they
bound
their
attention
here
there
was
a
little
spring
of
water
which
burst
forth
from
the
upper
ground
in
the
garden
and
ran
down
the
side
of
the
hill
in
a
small
stream
harry
and
tommy
laboured
very
hard
for
several
days
to
form
a
new
channel
to
lead
the
water
near
the
roots
of
their
trees
for
it
happened
to
be
hot
and
dry
weather
and
they
feared
their
trees
might
perish
from
the
want
of
moisture
mr
barlow
saw
them
employed
in
this
manner
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
he
told
them
that
in
many
parts
of
the
world
the
excessive
heat
burned
up
the
ground
so
much
that
nothing
would
grow
unless
the
soil
was
watered
in
that
manner
there
is
said
he
a
country
in
particular
called
egypt
which
has
always
been
famous
for
its
fertility
and
for
the
quantity
of
corn
that
grows
in
it
which
is
naturally
watered
in
the
following
extraordinary
manner
there
is
a
great
river
called
the
nile
which
flows
through
the
whole
extent
of
the
country
the
river
at
a
particular
time
of
the
year
begins
to
overflow
its
banks
and
as
the
whole
country
is
flat
it
very
soon
covers
it
all
with
its
waters
these
waters
remain
in
this
situation
several
weeks
before
they
have
entirely
drained
off
and
when
that
happens
they
leave
the
soil
so
rich
that
everything
that
is
planted
in
it
flourishes
and
produces
with
the
greatest
abundance
is
not
that
the
country
sir
said
harry
where
that
cruel
animal
the
crocodile
is
found
yes
answered
mr
barlow
what
is
that
sir
said
tommy
it
is
an
animal
answered
mr
barlow
that
lives
sometimes
upon
the
land
sometimes
in
the
water
it
comes
originally
from
an
egg
which
the
old
one
lays
and
buries
in
the
sand
the
heat
of
the
sun
then
warms
it
during
several
days
and
at
last
a
young
crocodile
is
hatched
this
animal
is
at
first
very
small
it
has
a
long
body
and
four
short
legs
which
serve
it
both
to
walk
with
upon
the
land
and
to
swim
with
in
the
waters
it
has
besides
a
long
tail
or
rather
the
body
is
extremely
long
and
gradually
grows
thinner
till
it
ends
in
a
point
its
shape
is
exactly
like
that
of
a
lizard
or
if
you
have
never
seen
a
lizard
did
you
never
observe
a
small
animal
of
some
inches
long
which
lives
at
the
bottom
of
ditches
and
ponds
yes
sir
i
have
answered
tommy
and
i
once
caught
one
with
my
hand
taking
it
for
a
fish
but
when
i
had
it
near
me
i
saw
it
had
four
little
legs
so
i
threw
it
into
the
water
again
for
fear
the
animal
should
be
hurt
this
animal
answered
mr
barlow
may
give
you
an
exact
idea
of
a
young
crocodile
but
as
it
grows
older
it
gradually
becomes
bigger
till
at
last
as
i
have
been
informed
it
reaches
the
length
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
that
is
very
large
said
tommy
and
does
it
do
any
harm
yes
said
mr
barlow
it
is
a
very
voracious
animal
and
devours
everything
it
can
seize
it
frequently
comes
out
of
the
water
and
lives
upon
the
shore
where
it
resembles
a
large
log
of
wood
and
if
any
animal
unguardedly
comes
near
it
snaps
at
it
on
a
sudden
and
if
it
can
catch
the
poor
creature
devours
it
and
does
it
never
devour
men
sometimes
if
it
surprises
them
but
those
who
are
accustomed
to
meet
with
them
frequently
easily
escape
they
run
round
in
a
circle
or
turn
short
on
a
sudden
by
which
means
the
animal
is
left
far
behind
because
although
he
can
run
tolerably
fast
in
a
straight
line
the
great
length
of
his
body
prevents
him
from
turning
with
ease
this
must
be
a
dreadful
animal
to
meet
with
is
it
possible
for
a
man
to
defend
himself
against
it
everything
is
possible
to
those
that
have
courage
and
coolness
therefore
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
countries
carry
long
spears
in
their
hands
in
order
to
defend
themselves
from
those
animals
the
crocodile
opens
his
wide
voracious
jaws
in
order
to
devour
the
man
but
the
man
takes
this
opportunity
and
thrusts
the
point
of
his
spear
into
the
creature
mouth
by
which
means
he
is
generally
killed
upon
the
spot
nay
i
have
even
heard
that
some
will
carry
their
hardiness
so
far
as
to
go
into
the
water
in
order
to
fight
the
crocodile
there
they
take
a
large
splinter
of
wood
about
a
foot
in
length
strong
in
the
middle
and
sharpened
at
both
ends
to
this
they
tie
a
long
and
tough
cord
the
man
who
intends
to
fight
the
crocodile
takes
this
piece
of
wood
in
his
right
hand
and
goes
into
the
river
where
he
wades
till
one
of
these
creatures
perceives
him
as
soon
as
that
happens
the
animal
comes
up
to
him
to
seize
him
extending
his
wide
and
horrid
jaws
which
are
armed
with
several
rows
of
pointed
teeth
but
the
man
with
the
greatest
intrepidity
waits
for
his
enemy
and
the
instant
he
approaches
thrusts
his
hand
armed
with
the
splinter
of
wood
into
his
terrible
mouth
which
the
creature
closes
directly
and
by
these
means
forces
the
sharp
points
into
each
of
his
jaws
where
they
stick
fast
he
is
then
incapable
of
doing
hurt
and
they
pull
him
to
the
shore
by
the
cord
pray
sir
said
tommy
is
this
dreadful
animal
capable
of
being
tamed
yes
answered
mr
barlow
i
believe
as
i
have
before
told
you
there
is
no
animal
that
may
not
be
rendered
mild
and
inoffensive
by
good
usage
there
are
several
parts
of
egypt
where
tame
crocodiles
are
kept
these
animals
though
of
the
largest
size
never
do
hurt
to
anything
but
suffer
every
one
to
approach
them
and
even
little
children
to
play
about
them
and
ride
securely
upon
their
enormous
backs
this
account
diverted
tommy
very
much
he
thanked
mr
barlow
for
giving
him
this
description
of
the
crocodile
and
said
he
should
like
to
see
every
animal
in
the
world
that
answered
mr
barlow
would
be
extremely
difficult
as
almost
every
country
produces
some
kind
which
is
not
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
but
if
you
will
be
contented
to
read
the
descriptions
of
them
which
have
been
written
you
may
easily
gratify
your
curiosity
it
happened
about
this
time
that
tommy
and
harry
rose
early
one
morning
and
went
to
take
a
long
walk
before
breakfast
as
they
used
frequently
to
do
they
rambled
so
far
that
at
last
they
both
found
themselves
tired
and
sat
down
under
a
hedge
to
rest
while
they
were
here
a
very
clean
and
woman
passed
by
who
seeing
two
little
boys
sitting
by
themselves
stopped
to
look
at
them
and
after
considering
them
attentively
she
said
you
seem
my
little
dears
to
be
either
tired
or
to
have
lost
your
way
no
madam
said
harry
we
have
not
lost
our
way
but
we
have
walked
farther
than
usual
this
morning
and
we
wait
here
a
little
while
to
rest
ourselves
well
said
the
woman
if
you
will
come
into
my
little
house
that
you
see
a
few
yards
farther
on
you
may
sit
more
comfortably
and
as
my
daughter
has
by
this
time
milked
the
cows
she
shall
give
you
a
mess
of
bread
and
milk
tommy
who
was
by
this
time
extremely
hungry
as
well
as
tired
told
harry
that
he
should
like
to
accept
the
good
woman
invitation
so
they
followed
her
to
a
small
but
clean
looking
which
stood
at
a
little
distance
here
they
entered
a
clean
kitchen
furnished
with
very
plain
but
convenient
furniture
and
were
desired
to
sit
down
by
a
warm
and
comfortable
fire
which
was
made
of
turf
tommy
who
had
never
seen
such
a
fire
could
not
help
inquiring
about
it
and
the
good
woman
told
him
that
poor
people
like
her
were
unable
to
purchase
coals
therefore
said
she
we
go
and
pare
the
surface
of
the
commons
which
is
full
of
grass
and
heath
and
other
vegetables
together
with
their
roots
all
matted
together
these
we
dry
in
small
pieces
by
leaving
them
exposed
to
the
summer
sun
and
then
we
bring
them
home
and
put
them
under
the
cover
of
a
shed
and
use
them
for
our
fires
but
said
tommy
i
should
think
you
would
hardly
have
fire
enough
by
these
means
to
dress
your
dinner
for
i
have
by
accident
been
in
my
kitchen
when
they
were
dressing
the
dinner
and
i
saw
a
fire
that
blazed
up
to
the
very
top
of
the
chimney
the
poor
woman
smiled
at
this
and
said
your
father
i
suppose
master
is
some
rich
man
who
has
a
great
deal
of
victuals
to
dress
but
we
poor
people
must
be
more
easily
contented
why
said
tommy
you
must
at
least
want
to
roast
meat
every
day
no
said
the
poor
woman
we
seldom
see
at
our
house
but
we
are
very
well
contented
if
we
can
have
a
bit
of
fat
pork
every
day
boiled
in
a
pot
with
turnips
and
we
bless
god
that
we
fare
so
well
for
there
are
many
poor
souls
who
are
as
good
as
we
that
can
scarcely
get
a
morsel
of
dry
bread
as
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
tommy
happened
to
cast
his
eyes
on
one
side
and
saw
a
room
that
was
almost
filled
with
apples
pray
said
he
what
can
you
do
with
all
these
apples
i
should
think
you
would
never
be
able
to
eat
them
though
you
were
to
eat
nothing
else
that
is
very
true
said
the
woman
but
we
make
cider
of
them
what
cried
tommy
are
you
able
to
make
that
sweet
pleasant
liquor
they
call
cider
and
is
it
made
of
apples
yes
indeed
it
is
and
pray
how
is
it
made
we
take
the
apples
when
they
are
ripe
and
squeeze
them
in
a
machine
we
have
for
that
purpose
then
we
take
this
pulp
and
put
it
into
large
which
we
press
in
a
large
press
till
all
the
juice
runs
out
and
is
this
juice
cider
you
shall
taste
little
master
as
you
seem
so
curious
she
then
led
him
into
another
room
where
there
was
a
great
tub
full
of
the
juice
of
apples
and
taking
some
up
in
a
cup
she
desired
him
to
taste
whether
it
was
cider
tommy
tasted
and
said
it
was
very
sweet
and
pleasant
but
not
cider
well
said
the
woman
let
us
try
another
cask
she
then
took
out
some
liquor
of
another
barrel
which
she
gave
him
and
tommy
when
he
had
tasted
it
said
that
it
really
was
cider
but
pray
said
he
what
do
you
do
to
the
to
make
it
cider
nothing
at
all
how
then
should
it
become
cider
for
i
am
sure
what
you
gave
me
at
first
is
not
cider
why
we
put
the
juice
into
a
large
cask
and
let
it
stand
in
some
warm
place
where
it
soon
begins
to
ferment
ferment
pray
what
is
that
you
shall
see
she
then
showed
him
another
cask
and
bade
him
observe
the
liquor
that
was
in
it
this
he
did
and
saw
it
was
covered
all
over
with
a
thick
scum
and
froth
and
is
this
what
you
call
fermentation
yes
master
and
what
is
the
reason
of
it
that
i
do
not
know
indeed
but
when
we
have
pressed
the
juice
out
as
i
told
you
we
put
it
into
a
cask
and
let
it
stand
in
some
warm
place
and
in
a
short
time
it
begins
to
work
or
ferment
of
itself
as
you
see
and
after
this
fermentation
has
continued
some
time
it
acquires
the
taste
and
properties
of
cider
and
then
we
draw
it
off
into
casks
and
sell
it
or
else
keep
it
for
our
own
use
and
i
am
told
this
is
the
manner
in
which
they
make
wine
in
other
countries
what
is
wine
made
of
apples
then
no
master
wine
is
made
of
grapes
but
they
squeeze
the
juice
out
and
treat
it
in
the
same
manner
as
we
do
the
juice
of
the
apples
i
declare
this
is
very
curious
indeed
then
cider
is
nothing
but
wine
made
of
apples
while
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
a
little
clean
girl
came
and
brought
tommy
an
earthen
porringer
full
of
new
milk
with
a
large
slice
of
brown
bread
tommy
took
it
and
ate
with
so
good
a
relish
that
he
thought
he
had
never
made
a
better
breakfast
in
his
life
when
harry
and
he
had
eaten
their
breakfast
tommy
told
him
it
was
time
they
should
return
home
so
he
thanked
the
good
woman
for
her
kindness
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
pulled
out
a
shilling
which
he
desired
her
to
accept
no
god
bless
you
my
little
dear
said
the
woman
i
will
not
take
a
farthing
off
you
for
the
world
what
though
my
husband
and
i
are
poor
yet
we
are
able
to
get
a
living
by
our
labour
and
give
a
mess
of
milk
to
a
traveller
without
hurting
ourselves
tommy
thanked
her
again
and
was
just
going
away
when
a
couple
of
men
came
in
and
asked
the
woman
if
her
name
was
yes
it
is
said
the
woman
i
have
never
been
ashamed
of
it
why
then
said
one
of
the
men
pulling
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
here
is
an
execution
against
you
on
the
part
of
mr
richard
gruff
and
if
your
husband
does
not
instantly
discharge
the
debt
with
interest
and
all
costs
amounting
altogether
to
the
sum
of
pounds
ten
shillings
we
shall
take
an
inventory
of
all
you
have
and
proceed
to
sell
it
by
auction
for
the
discharge
of
the
debt
indeed
said
the
poor
woman
looking
a
little
confused
this
must
certainly
be
a
mistake
for
i
never
heard
of
mr
richard
gruff
in
all
my
life
nor
do
i
believe
that
my
husband
owes
a
farthing
in
the
world
unless
to
his
landlord
and
i
know
that
he
has
almost
made
up
rent
for
him
so
that
i
do
not
think
he
would
go
to
trouble
a
poor
man
no
no
mistress
said
the
man
shaking
his
head
we
know
our
business
too
well
to
make
these
kind
of
mistakes
but
when
your
husband
comes
in
we
talk
with
him
in
the
meantime
we
must
go
on
with
our
inventory
the
two
men
then
went
into
the
next
room
and
immediately
after
a
stout
man
of
about
the
age
of
forty
came
in
with
a
countenance
and
asked
if
his
breakfast
was
ready
oh
my
poor
dear
william
said
the
woman
here
is
a
sad
breakfast
for
you
but
i
think
it
can
not
be
true
that
you
owe
anything
so
what
the
fellows
told
me
must
be
false
about
richard
gruff
at
this
name
the
man
instantly
started
and
his
countenance
which
was
before
ruddy
became
pale
as
a
sheet
surely
said
the
woman
it
can
not
be
true
that
you
owe
forty
pounds
to
richard
gruff
alas
answered
the
man
i
do
not
know
the
exact
sum
but
when
your
brother
peter
failed
and
his
creditors
seized
all
that
he
had
this
richard
gruff
was
going
to
send
him
to
jail
had
not
i
agreed
to
be
bound
for
him
which
enabled
him
to
go
to
sea
he
indeed
promised
to
remit
his
wages
to
me
to
prevent
my
getting
into
any
trouble
upon
that
account
but
you
know
it
is
now
three
years
since
he
went
and
in
all
that
time
we
have
heard
nothing
about
him
then
said
the
woman
bursting
into
tears
you
and
all
your
poor
dear
children
are
ruined
for
my
ungrateful
brother
for
here
are
two
bailiffs
in
the
house
who
are
come
to
take
possession
of
all
you
have
and
to
sell
it
at
this
the
man
face
became
red
as
scarlet
and
seizing
an
old
sword
which
hung
over
the
chimney
he
cried
out
no
it
shall
not
be
i
will
die
first
i
will
make
these
villains
know
what
it
is
to
make
honest
men
desperate
he
then
drew
the
sword
and
was
going
out
in
a
fit
of
madness
which
might
have
proved
fatal
either
to
himself
or
to
the
bailiffs
but
his
wife
flung
herself
upon
her
knees
before
him
and
catching
hold
of
his
legs
besought
him
to
be
more
composed
oh
for
heaven
sake
my
dear
dear
husband
said
she
consider
what
you
are
doing
you
can
do
neither
me
nor
your
children
any
service
by
this
violence
instead
of
that
should
you
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
kill
either
of
these
men
would
it
not
be
murder
and
would
not
our
lot
be
a
thousand
times
harder
than
it
is
at
present
this
remonstrance
seemed
to
have
some
effect
upon
the
farmer
his
children
too
although
too
young
to
understand
the
cause
of
all
this
confusion
gathered
round
him
and
hung
about
him
sobbing
in
concert
with
their
mother
little
harry
too
although
a
stranger
to
the
poor
man
before
yet
with
the
tenderest
sympathy
took
him
by
the
hand
and
bathed
it
with
his
tears
at
length
softened
and
overcome
by
the
sorrows
of
those
he
loved
so
well
and
by
his
own
cooler
reflections
he
resigned
the
fatal
instrument
and
sat
himself
down
upon
a
chair
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
and
only
saying
the
will
of
god
be
done
tommy
had
beheld
this
affecting
scene
with
the
greatest
attention
although
he
had
not
said
a
word
and
now
beckoning
harry
away
he
went
silently
out
of
the
house
and
took
the
road
which
led
to
mr
barlow
while
he
was
on
the
way
he
seemed
to
be
so
full
of
the
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
that
he
did
not
open
his
lips
but
when
he
came
home
he
instantly
went
to
mr
barlow
and
desired
that
he
would
directly
send
him
to
his
father
mr
barlow
stared
at
the
request
and
asked
him
what
was
the
occasion
of
his
being
so
suddenly
tired
with
his
residence
at
the
vicarage
sir
answered
tommy
i
am
not
the
least
tired
i
assure
you
you
have
been
extremely
kind
to
me
and
i
shall
always
remember
it
with
the
greatest
gratitude
but
i
want
to
see
my
father
immediately
and
i
am
sure
when
you
come
to
know
the
occasion
you
will
not
disapprove
of
it
mr
barlow
did
not
press
him
any
further
but
ordered
a
careful
servant
to
saddle
a
horse
directly
and
take
tommy
home
before
him
mr
and
mrs
merton
were
extremely
surprised
and
at
the
sight
of
their
son
who
thus
unexpectedly
arrived
at
home
but
tommy
whose
mind
was
full
of
the
project
he
had
formed
as
soon
as
he
had
answered
their
first
questions
accosted
his
father
thus
pray
sir
will
you
be
angry
with
me
if
i
ask
you
for
a
great
favour
no
surely
said
mr
merton
that
i
will
not
why
then
said
tommy
as
i
have
often
heard
you
say
that
you
were
very
rich
and
that
if
i
was
good
i
should
be
rich
too
will
you
give
me
some
money
money
said
mr
merton
yes
to
be
sure
how
much
do
you
want
why
sir
said
tommy
i
want
a
very
large
sum
indeed
perhaps
a
guinea
answered
mr
merton
no
sir
a
great
deal
more
a
great
many
guineas
let
us
however
see
why
sir
i
want
at
least
forty
pounds
bless
the
boy
answered
mrs
merton
surely
mr
barlow
must
have
taught
him
to
be
ten
times
more
extravagant
than
he
was
before
indeed
madam
mr
barlow
knows
nothing
about
the
matter
but
said
mr
merton
what
can
such
an
urchin
as
you
want
with
such
a
large
sum
of
money
sir
answered
tommy
that
is
a
secret
but
i
am
sure
when
you
come
to
hear
it
you
will
approve
of
the
use
i
intend
to
make
of
it
that
i
very
much
doubt
but
sir
if
you
please
you
may
let
me
have
this
money
and
i
will
pay
you
again
by
degrees
how
will
you
ever
be
able
to
pay
me
such
a
sum
why
sir
you
know
you
are
so
kind
as
frequently
to
give
me
new
clothes
and
now
if
you
will
only
let
me
have
this
money
i
will
neither
want
new
clothes
nor
anything
else
till
i
have
made
it
up
but
what
can
such
a
child
as
you
want
with
all
this
money
pray
sir
wait
a
few
days
and
you
shall
know
and
if
i
make
a
bad
use
of
it
never
believe
me
again
as
long
as
i
live
mr
merton
was
extremely
struck
with
the
earnestness
with
which
his
son
persevered
in
the
demand
and
as
he
was
both
very
rich
and
liberal
he
determined
to
hazard
the
experiment
and
comply
with
his
request
he
accordingly
went
and
fetched
him
the
money
which
he
asked
for
and
put
it
into
his
hands
telling
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
expected
to
be
acquainted
with
the
use
he
put
it
to
and
that
if
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
account
he
would
never
trust
him
again
tommy
appeared
in
ecstasies
at
the
confidence
that
was
reposed
in
him
and
after
thanking
his
father
for
his
extraordinary
goodness
he
desired
leave
to
go
back
again
with
mr
barlow
servant
when
he
arrived
at
mr
barlow
his
first
care
was
to
ask
harry
to
accompany
him
again
to
the
farmer
house
thither
the
two
little
boys
went
with
the
greatest
expedition
and
on
their
entering
the
house
found
the
unhappy
family
in
the
same
situation
as
before
but
tommy
who
had
hitherto
suppressed
his
feelings
finding
himself
now
enabled
to
execute
the
project
he
had
formed
went
up
to
the
good
woman
of
the
house
who
sat
sobbing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
taking
her
gently
by
the
hand
said
my
good
woman
you
were
very
kind
to
me
in
the
morning
and
therefore
i
am
determined
to
be
kind
to
you
in
return
god
bless
you
my
little
master
said
the
woman
you
are
very
welcome
to
what
you
had
but
you
are
not
able
to
do
anything
to
relieve
our
distress
how
do
you
know
that
said
tommy
perhaps
i
can
do
more
for
you
than
you
imagine
alas
answered
the
woman
i
believe
you
would
do
all
you
could
but
all
our
goods
will
be
seized
and
sold
unless
we
can
immediately
raise
the
sum
of
forty
pounds
and
that
is
impossible
for
we
have
no
earthly
friend
to
assist
us
therefore
my
poor
babes
and
i
must
soon
be
turned
out
of
doors
and
god
alone
can
keep
them
from
starving
tommy
little
heart
was
too
much
affected
to
keep
the
woman
longer
in
suspense
therefore
pulling
out
his
bag
of
money
he
poured
it
into
her
lap
saying
here
my
good
woman
take
this
and
pay
your
debts
and
god
bless
you
and
your
children
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
surprise
of
the
poor
woman
at
the
sight
she
stared
wildly
round
her
and
upon
her
little
benefactor
and
clasping
her
hands
together
in
an
agony
of
gratitude
and
feeling
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
with
a
kind
of
convulsive
motion
her
husband
who
was
in
the
next
room
seeing
her
in
this
condition
ran
up
to
her
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
asked
her
with
the
greatest
tenderness
what
was
the
matter
but
she
springing
on
a
sudden
from
his
embraces
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
the
little
boy
sobbing
and
blessing
with
a
broken
inarticulate
voice
embracing
his
knees
and
kissing
his
feet
the
husband
who
did
not
know
what
had
happened
imagined
that
his
wife
had
lost
her
senses
and
the
little
children
who
had
before
been
skulking
about
the
room
ran
up
to
their
mother
pulling
her
by
the
gown
and
hiding
their
faces
in
her
bosom
but
the
woman
at
the
sight
of
them
seemed
to
recollect
herself
and
cried
out
little
wretches
who
must
all
have
been
starved
without
the
assistance
of
this
little
angel
why
do
you
not
join
with
me
in
thanking
him
at
this
the
husband
said
surely
mary
you
must
have
lost
your
senses
what
can
this
young
gentleman
do
for
us
or
to
prevent
our
wretched
babes
from
perishing
oh
william
said
the
woman
i
am
not
mad
though
i
may
appear
so
but
look
here
william
look
what
providence
has
sent
us
by
the
hands
of
this
little
angel
and
then
wonder
not
that
i
should
be
wild
saying
this
she
held
up
the
money
and
at
the
sight
her
husband
looked
as
wild
and
astonished
as
she
but
tommy
went
up
to
the
man
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
my
good
friend
you
are
very
welcome
to
this
i
freely
give
it
you
and
i
hope
it
will
enable
you
to
pay
what
you
owe
and
to
preserve
these
poor
little
children
but
the
man
who
had
before
appeared
to
bear
his
misfortunes
with
silent
dignity
now
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
like
his
wife
and
children
but
tommy
who
now
began
to
be
pained
with
this
excess
of
gratitude
went
silently
out
of
the
house
followed
by
harry
and
before
the
poor
family
perceived
what
had
become
of
him
was
out
of
sight
when
he
came
back
to
mr
barlow
that
gentleman
received
him
with
the
greatest
affection
and
when
he
had
inquired
after
the
health
of
mr
and
mrs
merton
asked
tommy
whether
he
had
forgotten
the
story
of
the
grateful
turk
tommy
told
him
he
had
not
and
should
now
be
very
glad
to
hear
the
remainder
which
mr
barlow
gave
him
to
read
and
was
as
follows
continuation
of
the
history
of
the
grateful
turk
when
hamet
had
thus
finished
his
story
the
venetian
was
astonished
at
the
virtue
and
elevation
of
his
mind
and
after
saying
everything
that
his
gratitude
and
admiration
suggested
he
concluded
with
pressing
him
to
accept
the
half
of
his
fortune
and
to
settle
in
venice
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
this
offer
hamet
refused
with
the
greatest
respect
but
with
a
generous
disdain
and
told
his
friend
that
in
what
he
had
done
he
had
only
discharged
a
debt
of
gratitude
and
friendship
were
said
he
generous
benefactor
you
had
a
claim
upon
my
life
by
the
benefit
you
had
already
conferred
that
life
would
have
been
well
bestowed
had
it
been
lost
in
your
service
but
since
providence
hath
otherwise
decreed
it
is
a
sufficient
recompense
to
me
to
have
proved
that
hamet
is
not
ungrateful
and
to
have
been
instrumental
to
the
preservation
of
your
happiness
but
though
the
disinterestedness
of
hamet
made
him
underrate
his
own
exertions
the
merchant
could
not
remain
contented
without
showing
his
gratitude
by
all
the
means
within
his
power
he
therefore
once
more
purchased
the
freedom
of
hamet
and
freighted
a
ship
on
purpose
to
send
him
back
to
his
own
country
he
and
his
son
then
embraced
him
with
all
the
affection
that
gratitude
could
inspire
and
bade
him
as
they
thought
an
eternal
adieu
many
years
had
now
elapsed
since
the
departure
of
hamet
into
his
own
country
without
their
seeing
him
or
receiving
any
intelligence
from
him
in
the
mean
time
the
young
francisco
the
son
of
the
merchant
grew
up
to
manhood
and
as
he
had
acquired
every
accomplishment
which
tends
to
improve
the
mind
or
form
the
manners
added
to
an
excellent
disposition
he
was
generally
beloved
and
esteemed
it
happened
that
some
business
about
this
time
made
it
necessary
for
him
and
his
father
to
go
to
a
neighbouring
maritime
city
and
as
they
thought
a
passage
by
sea
would
be
more
expeditious
they
both
embarked
in
a
venetian
vessel
which
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
to
that
place
they
set
sail
therefore
with
favourable
winds
and
every
appearance
of
a
happy
passage
but
they
had
not
proceeded
more
than
half
their
intended
voyage
before
a
turkish
corsair
a
ship
purposely
fitted
out
for
war
was
seen
bearing
down
upon
them
and
as
the
enemy
exceeded
them
much
in
swiftness
they
soon
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
escape
the
greater
part
of
the
crew
belonging
to
the
venetian
vessel
were
struck
with
consternation
and
seemed
already
overcome
with
fear
but
the
young
francisco
drawing
his
sword
reproached
his
comrades
with
their
cowardice
and
so
effectually
encouraged
them
that
they
determined
to
defend
their
liberty
by
a
desperate
resistance
the
turkish
vessel
now
approached
them
in
awful
silence
but
in
an
instant
the
dreadful
noise
of
the
artillery
was
heard
and
the
heavens
were
obscured
with
smoke
intermixed
with
transitory
flashes
of
fire
three
times
did
the
turks
leap
with
horrid
shouts
upon
the
deck
of
the
venetian
vessel
and
three
times
were
they
driven
back
by
the
desperate
resistance
of
the
crew
headed
by
young
francisco
at
length
the
slaughter
of
their
men
was
so
great
that
they
seemed
disposed
to
discontinue
the
fight
and
were
actually
taking
another
course
the
venetians
beheld
their
flight
with
the
greatest
joy
and
were
congratulating
each
other
upon
their
successful
valour
and
merited
escape
when
two
more
ships
on
a
sudden
appeared
in
sight
bearing
down
upon
them
with
incredible
swiftness
before
the
wind
every
heart
was
now
chilled
with
new
terrors
when
on
their
nearer
approach
they
discovered
the
fatal
ensigns
of
their
enemies
and
knew
that
there
was
no
longer
any
possibility
either
of
resistance
or
escape
they
therefore
lowered
their
flag
the
sign
of
surrendering
their
ship
and
in
an
instant
saw
themselves
in
the
power
of
their
enemies
who
came
pouring
in
on
every
side
with
the
rage
and
violence
of
beasts
of
prey
all
that
remained
alive
of
the
brave
venetian
crew
were
loaded
with
fetters
and
closely
guarded
in
the
hold
of
the
ship
till
it
arrived
at
tunis
they
were
then
brought
out
in
chains
and
exposed
in
the
public
market
to
be
sold
for
slaves
they
had
there
the
mortification
to
see
their
companions
picked
out
one
by
one
according
to
their
apparent
strength
and
vigour
and
sold
to
different
masters
at
length
a
turk
approached
who
from
his
look
and
habit
appeared
to
be
of
superior
rank
and
after
glancing
his
eye
over
the
rest
with
an
expression
of
compassion
he
fixed
them
at
last
upon
young
francisco
and
demanded
of
the
captain
of
the
ship
what
was
the
price
of
that
young
man
the
captain
answered
that
he
would
not
take
less
than
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
for
that
captive
said
the
turk
very
extraordinary
since
i
have
seen
you
sell
those
that
much
exceed
him
in
vigour
for
less
than
a
fifth
part
of
that
sum
answered
the
captain
he
shall
either
pay
me
some
part
of
the
damage
he
has
occasioned
or
labour
for
life
at
the
oar
damage
answered
the
other
he
have
done
you
more
than
all
the
rest
whom
you
have
prized
so
cheaply
it
was
replied
the
captain
animated
the
christians
to
that
desperate
resistance
which
cost
me
the
lives
of
so
many
of
my
brave
sailors
three
times
did
we
leap
upon
their
deck
with
a
fury
that
seemed
irresistible
and
three
times
did
that
youth
attack
us
with
such
cool
determined
opposition
that
we
were
obliged
to
retreat
ingloriously
leaving
at
every
charge
twenty
of
our
number
behind
therefore
i
repeat
it
i
will
either
have
that
price
for
him
great
as
it
may
appear
or
else
i
will
gratify
my
revenge
by
seeing
him
drudge
for
life
in
my
victorious
galley
at
this
the
turk
examined
young
francisco
with
new
attention
and
he
who
had
hitherto
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
in
sullen
silence
now
lifted
them
up
but
scarcely
had
he
beheld
the
person
that
was
talking
to
the
captain
when
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
repeated
the
name
of
the
turk
with
equal
emotion
surveyed
him
for
a
moment
and
then
catching
him
in
his
arms
embraced
him
with
the
transports
of
a
parent
who
unexpectedly
recovers
a
child
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
all
that
gratitude
and
affection
inspired
hamet
to
say
but
when
he
heard
that
his
ancient
benefactor
was
amongst
the
number
of
those
unhappy
venetians
who
stood
before
him
he
hid
his
face
for
a
moment
under
his
vest
and
seemed
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
astonishment
when
recollecting
himself
he
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
and
blessed
that
providence
which
had
made
him
the
instrument
of
safety
to
his
ancient
benefactor
he
then
instantly
flew
to
that
part
of
the
market
where
francisco
stood
waiting
for
his
fate
with
a
manly
mute
despair
he
called
him
his
friend
his
benefactor
and
every
endearing
name
which
friendship
and
gratitude
could
inspire
and
ordering
his
chains
to
be
instantly
taken
off
he
conducted
him
and
his
son
to
a
magnificent
house
which
belonged
to
him
in
the
city
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
and
had
time
for
an
explanation
of
their
mutual
fortunes
hamet
told
the
venetians
that
when
he
was
set
at
liberty
by
their
generosity
and
restored
to
his
country
he
had
accepted
a
command
in
the
turkish
armies
and
that
having
had
the
good
fortune
to
distinguish
himself
on
several
occasions
he
had
gradually
been
promoted
through
various
offices
to
the
dignity
of
bashaw
of
tunis
i
have
enjoyed
this
post
added
he
is
nothing
which
i
find
in
it
so
agreeable
as
the
power
it
gives
me
of
alleviating
the
misfortunes
of
those
unhappy
christians
who
are
taken
prisoners
by
our
corsairs
whenever
a
ship
arrives
which
brings
with
it
any
of
these
sufferers
i
constantly
visit
the
markets
and
redeem
a
certain
number
of
the
captives
whom
i
restore
to
liberty
and
gracious
allah
has
shown
that
he
approves
of
these
faint
endeavours
to
discharge
the
sacred
duties
of
gratitude
for
my
own
redemption
by
putting
it
in
my
power
to
serve
the
best
and
dearest
of
men
ten
days
were
francisco
and
his
son
entertained
in
the
house
of
hamet
during
which
time
he
put
in
practice
everything
within
his
power
to
please
and
interest
them
but
when
he
found
they
were
desirous
of
returning
home
he
told
them
he
would
no
longer
detain
them
from
their
country
but
that
they
should
embark
the
next
day
in
a
ship
that
was
setting
sail
for
venice
accordingly
on
the
morrow
he
dismissed
them
with
many
embraces
and
much
reluctance
and
ordered
a
chosen
party
of
his
own
guards
to
conduct
them
on
board
their
vessel
when
they
arrived
there
their
joy
and
admiration
were
considerably
increased
on
finding
that
by
the
generosity
of
hamet
not
only
the
ship
which
had
been
taken
but
the
whole
crew
were
redeemed
and
restored
to
freedom
francisco
and
his
son
embarked
and
after
a
favourable
voyage
arrived
without
accident
in
their
own
country
where
they
lived
many
years
respected
and
esteemed
continually
mindful
of
the
vicissitudes
of
human
affairs
and
attentive
to
discharge
their
duties
to
their
when
this
story
was
concluded
mr
barlow
and
his
pupils
went
out
to
walk
upon
the
high
road
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
discovered
three
men
who
seemed
each
to
lead
a
large
and
shaggy
beast
by
a
string
followed
by
a
crowd
of
boys
and
women
whom
the
novelty
of
the
sight
had
drawn
together
when
they
approached
more
near
mr
barlow
discovered
that
the
beasts
were
three
tame
bears
led
by
as
many
savoyards
who
get
their
living
by
exhibiting
them
upon
the
head
of
each
of
these
formidable
animals
was
seated
a
monkey
who
grinned
and
chattered
and
by
his
strange
grimaces
excited
the
mirth
of
the
whole
assembly
tommy
who
had
never
before
seen
one
of
these
creatures
was
very
much
surprised
and
entertained
but
still
more
so
when
he
saw
the
animal
rise
upon
his
hind
legs
at
the
word
of
command
and
dance
about
in
a
strange
uncouth
manner
to
the
sound
of
music
after
having
satisfied
themselves
with
this
spectacle
they
proceeded
on
their
way
and
tommy
asked
mr
barlow
whether
a
bear
was
an
animal
easily
tamed
and
that
did
mischief
in
those
places
where
he
was
wild
the
bear
replied
mr
barlow
is
not
an
animal
quite
so
formidable
or
destructive
as
a
lion
or
a
tiger
he
is
however
sufficiently
dangerous
and
will
frequently
devour
women
and
children
and
even
men
when
he
has
an
opportunity
these
creatures
are
generally
found
in
cold
countries
and
it
is
observed
that
the
colder
the
climate
is
the
greater
size
and
fierceness
do
they
attain
to
there
is
a
remarkable
account
of
one
of
these
animals
suddenly
attacking
a
soldier
when
on
duty
but
it
was
fortunate
for
the
poor
fellow
that
the
first
blow
he
struck
the
bear
felled
him
to
the
ground
and
the
soldier
immediately
plunged
his
sword
into
his
heart
which
of
course
killed
it
in
those
northern
countries
which
are
perpetually
covered
with
snow
and
ice
a
species
of
bear
is
found
which
is
white
in
colour
and
of
amazing
strength
as
well
as
fierceness
these
animals
are
often
seen
clambering
over
the
huge
pieces
of
ice
that
almost
cover
those
seas
and
preying
upon
fish
and
other
sea
animals
i
remember
reading
an
account
of
one
that
came
unexpectedly
upon
some
sailors
who
were
boiling
their
dinners
on
the
shore
this
creature
had
two
young
ones
with
her
and
the
sailors
as
you
may
easily
imagine
did
not
like
such
dangerous
guests
but
made
their
escape
immediately
to
the
ship
the
old
bear
then
seized
upon
the
flesh
which
the
sailors
had
left
and
set
it
before
her
cubs
reserving
a
very
small
portion
for
herself
showing
by
this
that
she
took
a
much
greater
interest
in
their
welfare
than
her
own
but
the
sailors
enraged
at
the
loss
of
their
dinners
levelled
their
muskets
at
the
cubs
and
from
the
ship
shot
them
both
dead
they
also
wounded
the
dam
who
was
fetching
away
another
piece
of
flesh
but
not
mortally
so
that
she
was
still
able
to
move
but
it
would
have
affected
any
one
with
pity
but
a
brutal
mind
says
the
relation
to
see
the
behaviour
of
this
poor
beast
all
wounded
as
she
was
and
bleeding
to
her
young
ones
though
she
was
sorely
hurt
and
could
but
crawl
to
the
place
where
they
lay
she
carried
the
lump
of
flesh
she
had
in
her
mouth
as
she
had
done
the
preceding
ones
and
laid
it
down
before
them
and
when
she
observed
that
they
did
not
eat
she
laid
her
paws
first
upon
one
and
then
upon
the
other
and
endeavoured
to
raise
them
up
all
this
while
making
the
most
pitiful
moans
when
she
found
that
they
did
not
stir
she
went
away
to
a
little
distance
and
then
looked
back
and
moaned
as
if
to
entice
them
to
her
but
finding
them
still
immovable
she
returned
and
smelling
round
them
began
to
lick
their
wounds
she
then
went
off
a
second
time
as
before
and
after
crawling
a
few
yards
turned
back
and
moaned
as
if
to
entreat
them
not
to
desert
their
mother
but
her
cubs
not
yet
rising
to
follow
her
she
returned
to
them
again
and
with
signs
of
inexpressible
fondness
went
round
first
one
and
then
the
other
pawing
them
and
moaning
all
the
time
finding
them
at
last
cold
and
lifeless
she
raised
her
head
towards
the
ship
and
began
to
growl
in
an
indignant
manner
as
if
she
were
denouncing
vengeance
against
the
murderers
of
her
young
but
the
sailors
levelled
their
muskets
again
and
wounded
her
in
so
many
places
that
she
dropped
down
between
her
young
ones
yet
even
while
she
was
expiring
she
seemed
only
sensible
to
their
fate
and
died
licking
their
wounds
and
is
it
possible
said
harry
that
men
can
be
so
cruel
towards
poor
unfortunate
animals
it
is
too
true
answered
mr
barlow
that
men
are
frequently
guilty
of
every
wanton
and
unnecessary
acts
of
barbarity
but
in
this
case
it
is
probable
that
the
fear
of
these
animals
contributed
to
render
the
sailors
more
unpitying
than
they
would
otherwise
have
been
they
had
often
seen
themselves
in
danger
of
being
devoured
and
that
inspired
them
with
a
great
degree
of
hatred
against
them
which
they
took
the
opportunity
of
gratifying
but
would
it
not
be
enough
answered
harry
if
they
carried
arms
to
defend
themselves
when
they
were
attacked
without
unnecessarily
destroying
other
creatures
who
did
not
meddle
with
them
to
be
sure
it
would
replied
mr
barlow
and
a
generous
mind
would
at
any
time
rather
spare
an
enemy
than
destroy
him
while
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
they
beheld
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
running
away
in
the
greatest
trepidation
and
looking
behind
them
saw
that
one
of
the
bears
had
broken
his
chain
and
was
running
after
them
growling
all
the
time
in
a
very
disagreeable
manner
mr
barlow
who
had
a
good
stick
in
his
hand
and
was
a
man
of
an
intrepid
character
perceiving
this
bade
his
pupils
remain
quiet
and
instantly
ran
up
to
the
bear
who
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
career
and
seemed
inclined
to
attack
mr
barlow
for
his
interference
but
this
gentleman
struck
him
two
or
three
blows
rating
him
at
the
same
time
in
a
loud
and
severe
tone
of
voice
and
seizing
the
end
of
the
chain
with
equal
boldness
and
dexterity
the
animal
quietly
submitted
and
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
prisoner
presently
the
keeper
of
the
bear
came
up
into
whose
hands
mr
barlow
consigned
him
charging
him
for
the
future
to
be
more
careful
in
guarding
so
dangerous
a
creature
while
this
was
doing
the
boys
had
remained
quiet
spectators
at
a
distance
but
by
accident
the
monkey
who
used
to
be
perched
upon
the
head
of
the
bear
and
was
shaken
off
when
the
beast
broke
loose
came
running
that
way
playing
a
thousand
antic
grimaces
as
he
passed
tommy
who
was
determined
not
to
be
outdone
by
mr
barlow
ran
very
resolutely
up
and
seized
a
string
which
was
tied
round
the
loins
of
the
animal
but
he
not
choosing
to
be
taken
prisoner
instantly
snapped
at
arm
and
almost
made
his
teeth
meet
in
the
fleshy
part
of
it
yet
tommy
who
was
now
greatly
improved
in
courage
and
the
use
of
his
limbs
instead
of
letting
his
enemy
escape
began
thrashing
him
very
severely
with
the
stick
which
he
had
in
his
hand
till
the
monkey
seeing
he
had
so
resolute
an
antagonist
to
deal
with
desisted
from
opposition
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
captive
like
his
friend
the
bear
as
they
were
returning
home
tommy
asked
mr
barlow
whether
he
did
not
think
it
very
dangerous
to
meddle
with
such
an
animal
when
he
was
loose
mr
barlow
told
him
it
was
not
without
danger
but
that
it
was
much
less
so
than
most
people
would
imagine
most
animals
said
he
are
easily
awed
by
the
appearance
of
intrepidity
while
they
are
invited
to
pursue
by
marks
of
fear
and
apprehension
that
i
believe
is
very
true
answered
harry
for
i
have
very
often
observed
the
behaviour
of
dogs
to
each
other
when
two
strange
dogs
meet
they
generally
approach
with
caution
as
if
they
were
mutually
afraid
but
as
sure
as
either
of
them
runs
away
the
other
will
pursue
him
with
the
greatest
insolence
and
fury
this
is
not
confined
to
dogs
replied
mr
barlow
almost
all
wild
beasts
are
subject
to
receive
the
sudden
impression
of
terror
and
therefore
men
who
have
been
obliged
to
travel
without
arms
through
forests
that
abound
with
dangerous
animals
have
frequently
escaped
unhurt
by
shouting
aloud
whenever
they
met
with
any
of
them
on
their
way
but
what
i
chiefly
depended
on
was
the
education
which
the
bear
had
received
since
he
left
his
own
country
tommy
laughed
heartily
at
this
idea
and
mr
barlow
went
on
whenever
an
animal
is
taught
anything
that
is
not
natural
to
him
this
is
properly
receiving
an
education
did
you
ever
observe
colts
running
about
wild
upon
the
common
yes
sir
very
often
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
any
one
to
mount
upon
their
backs
or
ride
them
by
no
means
i
think
that
they
would
kick
and
prance
to
that
degree
that
they
would
throw
any
person
down
and
yet
your
little
horse
very
frequently
takes
you
upon
his
back
and
carries
you
very
safely
between
this
and
your
father
house
that
is
because
he
is
used
to
it
but
he
was
not
always
used
to
it
he
was
once
a
colt
and
then
he
ran
about
as
wild
and
unrestrained
as
any
of
those
upon
the
common
yes
sir
how
came
he
then
to
be
so
altered
as
to
submit
to
bear
you
upon
his
back
i
do
not
know
unless
it
was
by
feeding
him
that
is
one
method
but
that
is
not
all
they
first
accustom
the
colt
who
naturally
follows
his
mother
to
come
into
the
stable
with
her
then
they
stroke
him
and
feed
him
till
he
gradually
becomes
gentle
and
will
suffer
himself
to
be
handled
then
they
take
an
opportunity
of
putting
a
halter
upon
his
head
and
accustom
him
to
stand
quietly
in
the
stable
and
to
be
tied
to
the
manger
thus
they
gradually
proceed
from
one
thing
to
another
till
they
teach
him
to
bear
the
bridle
and
the
saddle
and
to
be
commanded
by
his
rider
this
may
very
properly
be
called
the
of
an
animal
since
by
these
means
he
is
obliged
to
acquire
habits
which
he
would
never
have
learned
had
he
been
left
to
himself
now
i
knew
that
the
poor
bear
had
been
frequently
beaten
and
very
in
order
to
make
him
submit
to
be
led
about
with
a
string
and
exhibited
as
a
sight
i
knew
that
he
had
been
accustomed
to
submit
to
man
and
to
tremble
at
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
and
i
depended
upon
the
force
of
these
impressions
for
making
him
submit
without
resistance
to
the
authority
i
assumed
over
him
you
saw
i
was
not
deceived
in
my
opinion
and
by
these
means
i
probably
prevented
the
mischief
that
he
might
otherwise
have
done
to
some
of
those
women
or
children
as
mr
barlow
was
talking
in
this
manner
he
perceived
that
tommy
arm
was
bloody
and
inquiring
into
the
reason
he
heard
the
history
of
his
adventure
with
the
monkey
mr
barlow
then
looked
at
the
wound
which
he
found
of
no
great
consequence
and
told
tommy
that
he
was
sorry
for
his
accident
and
imagined
that
he
was
now
too
courageous
to
be
daunted
by
a
trifling
hurt
tommy
assured
him
he
was
and
proceeded
to
ask
some
questions
concerning
the
nature
of
the
monkey
which
mr
barlow
answered
in
the
following
manner
the
monkey
is
a
very
extraordinary
animal
which
closely
resembles
a
man
in
his
shape
and
appearance
as
perhaps
you
may
have
observed
he
is
always
found
to
inhabit
hot
countries
the
forests
of
which
in
many
parts
of
the
world
are
filled
with
innumerable
bands
of
these
animals
he
is
extremely
active
and
his
exactly
resemble
the
arms
of
a
man
so
that
he
not
only
uses
them
to
walk
upon
but
frequently
to
climb
trees
to
hang
by
the
branches
and
to
take
hold
of
his
food
with
he
supports
himself
upon
almost
every
species
of
wild
fruit
which
is
found
in
those
countries
so
that
it
is
necessary
he
should
be
continually
scrambling
up
and
down
the
highest
trees
in
order
to
procure
himself
a
subsistence
nor
is
he
contented
always
with
the
diet
which
he
finds
in
the
forest
where
he
makes
his
residence
large
bands
of
these
creatures
will
frequently
sally
out
to
plunder
the
gardens
in
the
neighbourhood
and
many
wonderful
stories
are
told
of
their
ingenuity
and
contrivance
what
are
these
said
tommy
it
is
said
answered
mr
barlow
that
they
proceed
with
all
the
caution
and
regularity
which
could
be
found
in
men
themselves
some
of
these
animals
are
placed
as
spies
to
give
notice
to
the
rest
in
case
any
human
being
should
approach
the
garden
and
should
that
happen
one
of
the
sentinels
informs
them
by
a
peculiar
chattering
and
they
all
escape
in
an
instant
i
can
easily
believe
that
answered
harry
for
i
have
observed
that
when
a
flock
of
rooks
alight
upon
a
farmer
field
of
corn
two
or
three
of
them
always
take
their
station
upon
the
highest
tree
they
can
find
and
if
any
one
approaches
they
instantly
give
notice
by
their
cawing
and
all
the
rest
take
wing
directly
and
fly
away
but
answered
mr
barlow
the
monkeys
are
said
to
be
yet
more
ingenious
in
their
thefts
for
they
station
some
of
their
body
at
a
small
distance
from
each
other
in
a
line
that
reaches
quite
from
the
forest
they
inhabit
to
the
particular
garden
they
wish
to
plunder
when
this
is
done
several
of
them
mount
the
fairest
and
picking
the
fruit
throw
it
down
to
their
companions
who
stand
below
these
again
cast
it
to
others
at
a
little
distance
and
thus
it
flies
from
hand
to
hand
till
it
is
safely
deposited
in
the
woods
or
mountains
whence
they
came
when
they
are
taken
very
young
they
are
easily
tamed
but
always
retain
a
great
disposition
to
mischief
as
well
as
to
imitate
everything
they
see
done
by
men
many
ridiculous
stories
are
told
of
them
in
this
respect
i
have
heard
of
a
monkey
that
resided
in
a
gentleman
family
and
that
frequently
observed
his
master
undergo
the
operation
of
shaving
the
imitative
animal
one
day
took
it
into
his
head
to
turn
barber
and
seizing
in
one
hand
a
cat
that
lived
in
the
same
house
and
a
bottle
of
ink
in
the
other
he
carried
her
up
to
the
top
of
a
very
fine
marble
staircase
the
servants
were
all
attracted
by
the
screams
of
the
cat
who
did
not
relish
the
operation
which
was
going
forward
and
running
out
were
equally
surprised
and
diverted
to
see
the
monkey
gravely
seated
upon
the
of
the
stairs
and
holding
the
cat
fast
in
one
of
his
paws
while
with
the
other
he
continually
applied
ink
to
puss
face
rubbing
it
all
over
just
as
he
had
observed
the
barber
do
to
his
master
whenever
the
cat
struggled
to
escape
the
monkey
gave
her
a
pat
with
his
paw
chattering
all
the
time
and
making
the
most
ridiculous
grimaces
and
when
she
was
quiet
he
applied
himself
to
his
bottle
and
continued
the
operation
but
i
have
heard
a
more
tragic
story
of
the
imitative
genius
of
these
animals
one
of
them
lived
in
a
fortified
town
and
used
frequently
to
run
up
and
down
upon
the
ramparts
where
he
had
observed
the
gunner
discharge
the
great
guns
that
defended
the
town
one
day
he
got
possession
of
the
lighted
match
with
which
the
man
used
to
perform
his
business
and
applying
it
to
the
of
a
gun
he
ran
to
the
mouth
of
it
to
see
the
explosion
but
the
cannon
which
happened
to
be
loaded
instantly
went
off
and
blew
the
poor
monkey
into
a
thousand
pieces
when
they
came
back
to
mr
barlow
they
found
master
merton
servant
and
horses
waiting
to
bring
him
home
when
he
arrived
there
he
was
received
with
the
greatest
joy
and
tenderness
by
his
parents
but
though
he
gave
them
an
account
of
everything
else
that
had
happened
he
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
money
he
had
given
to
the
farmer
but
the
next
day
being
sunday
mr
and
mrs
merton
and
tommy
went
together
to
the
parish
church
which
they
had
scarcely
entered
when
a
general
whisper
ran
through
the
whole
congregation
and
all
eyes
were
in
an
instant
turned
upon
the
little
boy
mr
and
mrs
merton
were
very
much
astonished
at
this
but
they
forbore
to
inquire
until
the
end
of
the
service
then
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
church
together
mr
merton
asked
his
son
what
could
be
the
reason
of
the
general
attention
which
he
excited
at
his
entrance
into
church
tommy
had
no
time
to
answer
for
at
that
instant
a
very
woman
ran
up
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
calling
him
her
guardian
angel
and
preserver
and
praying
that
heaven
would
shower
down
upon
his
head
all
the
blessings
which
he
deserved
it
was
some
time
before
mr
and
mrs
merton
could
understand
the
nature
of
this
extraordinary
scene
but
when
they
at
length
understood
the
secret
of
their
son
generosity
they
seemed
to
be
scarcely
less
affected
than
the
woman
herself
and
shedding
tears
of
transport
and
affection
they
embraced
their
son
without
attending
to
the
crowd
that
surrounded
them
but
immediately
recollecting
themselves
they
took
their
leave
of
the
poor
woman
and
hurried
to
their
coach
with
such
sensations
as
it
is
more
easy
to
conceive
than
to
describe
the
summer
had
now
completely
passed
away
and
the
winter
had
set
in
with
unusual
severity
the
water
was
all
frozen
into
a
solid
mass
of
ice
the
earth
was
bare
of
food
and
the
little
birds
that
used
to
chirp
with
gladness
seemed
to
lament
in
silence
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
as
tommy
was
one
day
reading
the
life
of
napoleon
bonaparte
particularly
the
famous
anecdote
of
the
fortress
of
snow
in
which
napoleon
is
described
as
undertaking
the
siege
and
giving
directions
to
his
how
to
make
the
attack
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
pretty
bird
flying
about
the
chamber
in
which
he
was
reading
he
immediately
went
down
stairs
and
informed
mr
barlow
of
the
circumstance
who
after
he
had
seen
the
bird
told
him
that
it
was
called
a
robin
redbreast
and
that
it
was
naturally
more
tame
and
disposed
to
cultivate
the
society
of
men
than
any
other
species
but
at
present
added
he
the
little
fellow
is
in
want
of
food
because
the
earth
is
too
hard
to
furnish
him
any
assistance
and
hunger
inspires
him
with
this
unusual
boldness
why
then
sir
said
tommy
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
will
fetch
a
piece
of
bread
and
feed
him
do
so
answered
mr
barlow
but
first
set
the
window
open
that
he
may
see
you
do
not
intend
to
take
him
prisoner
tommy
accordingly
opened
his
window
and
scattering
a
few
crumbs
of
bread
about
the
room
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
guest
hop
down
and
make
a
very
hearty
meal
he
then
flew
out
of
the
room
and
settled
upon
a
neighbouring
tree
singing
all
the
time
as
if
to
return
thanks
for
the
hospitality
he
had
met
with
tommy
was
greatly
delighted
with
his
new
acquaintance
and
from
this
time
never
failed
to
set
his
window
open
every
morning
and
scatter
some
crumbs
about
the
room
which
the
bird
perceiving
hopped
fearlessly
in
and
regaled
himself
under
the
protection
of
his
benefactor
by
degrees
the
intimacy
increased
so
much
that
little
robin
would
alight
on
shoulder
and
whistle
his
notes
in
that
situation
or
eat
out
of
his
hand
all
which
gave
tommy
so
much
satisfaction
that
he
would
frequently
call
mr
barlow
and
harry
to
be
witness
of
his
favourite
caresses
nor
did
he
ever
eat
his
own
meals
without
reserving
a
part
for
his
little
friend
it
however
happened
that
one
day
tommy
went
upstairs
after
dinner
intending
to
feed
his
bird
as
usual
but
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
chamber
he
discovered
a
sight
that
pierced
him
to
the
very
heart
his
little
friend
and
innocent
companion
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
and
torn
in
pieces
and
a
large
cat
taking
that
opportunity
to
escape
soon
directed
his
suspicions
towards
the
murderer
tommy
instantly
ran
down
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
relate
the
unfortunate
death
of
his
favourite
to
mr
barlow
and
to
demand
vengeance
against
the
wicked
cat
that
had
occasioned
it
mr
barlow
heard
him
with
great
compassion
but
asked
what
punishment
he
wished
to
inflict
upon
the
cat
oh
sir
nothing
can
be
too
bad
for
that
cruel
animal
i
would
have
her
killed
as
she
killed
the
poor
bird
but
do
you
imagine
that
she
did
it
out
of
any
particular
malice
to
your
bird
or
merely
because
she
was
hungry
and
accustomed
to
catch
her
prey
in
that
manner
tommy
considered
some
time
but
at
last
he
owned
that
he
did
not
suspect
the
cat
of
having
any
particular
spite
against
his
bird
and
therefore
he
supposed
she
had
been
impelled
by
hunger
have
you
never
observed
that
it
was
the
property
of
that
species
to
prey
upon
mice
and
other
little
animals
yes
sir
very
often
and
have
you
ever
corrected
her
for
so
doing
or
attempted
to
teach
her
other
habits
i
can
not
say
i
have
indeed
i
have
seen
little
harry
when
she
had
caught
a
mouse
and
was
tormenting
it
take
it
from
her
and
give
it
liberty
but
i
have
never
meddled
with
her
myself
are
you
not
then
more
to
be
blamed
than
the
cat
herself
you
have
observed
that
it
was
common
to
the
whole
species
to
destroy
mice
and
little
birds
whenever
they
could
surprise
them
yet
you
have
taken
no
pains
to
secure
your
favourite
from
the
danger
on
the
contrary
by
rendering
him
tame
and
accustoming
him
to
be
fed
you
have
exposed
him
to
a
violent
death
which
he
would
probably
have
avoided
had
he
remained
wild
would
it
not
then
be
just
and
more
reasonable
to
endeavour
to
teach
the
cat
that
she
must
no
longer
prey
upon
little
birds
than
to
put
her
to
death
for
what
you
have
never
taught
her
was
an
offence
but
is
that
possible
very
possible
i
should
imagine
but
we
may
at
least
try
the
experiment
but
why
should
such
a
mischievous
creature
live
at
all
because
if
you
destroy
every
creature
that
preys
upon
others
you
would
perhaps
leave
few
alive
surely
sir
the
poor
bird
which
that
naughty
cat
has
killed
was
never
guilty
of
such
a
cruelty
i
will
not
answer
for
that
let
us
observe
what
they
live
upon
in
the
fields
we
shall
then
be
able
to
give
a
better
account
mr
barlow
then
went
to
the
window
and
desired
tommy
to
come
to
him
and
observe
a
robin
which
was
then
hopping
upon
the
grass
with
something
in
its
mouth
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
it
was
i
protest
sir
it
is
a
large
worm
and
now
he
has
swallowed
it
i
should
never
have
thought
that
such
a
pretty
bird
could
have
been
so
cruel
do
you
imagine
that
the
bird
is
conscious
of
all
that
is
suffered
by
the
insect
no
sir
in
him
then
it
is
not
the
same
cruelty
which
it
would
be
in
you
who
are
endowed
with
reason
and
reflection
nature
has
given
him
a
propensity
for
animal
food
which
he
obeys
in
the
same
manner
as
the
sheep
and
ox
when
they
feed
upon
grass
or
as
the
ass
when
he
browses
upon
the
furze
or
thistles
why
then
perhaps
the
cat
did
not
know
the
cruelty
she
was
guilty
of
in
tearing
that
poor
bird
to
pieces
no
more
than
the
bird
we
have
just
seen
is
conscious
of
his
cruelty
to
the
insect
the
natural
food
of
cats
consists
in
rats
mice
birds
and
such
small
animals
as
they
can
seize
by
violence
or
catch
by
craft
it
was
impossible
she
should
know
the
value
you
set
upon
your
bird
and
therefore
she
had
no
more
intention
of
offending
you
than
had
she
caught
a
mouse
but
if
that
is
the
case
should
i
have
another
tame
bird
she
would
kill
it
as
she
has
done
this
poor
fellow
that
perhaps
may
be
prevented
i
have
heard
people
that
deal
in
birds
affirm
there
is
a
way
of
preventing
cats
from
meddling
with
them
oh
dear
sir
i
should
like
to
try
it
will
you
not
show
me
how
to
prevent
the
cat
from
killing
any
more
birds
most
willingly
it
is
certainly
better
to
correct
the
faults
of
an
animal
than
to
destroy
it
besides
i
have
a
particular
affection
for
this
cat
because
i
found
her
when
she
was
a
kitten
and
have
bred
her
up
so
tame
and
gentle
that
she
will
follow
me
about
like
a
dog
she
comes
every
morning
to
my
and
mews
till
she
is
let
in
and
she
sits
upon
the
table
at
breakfast
and
dinner
as
grave
and
polite
as
a
visitor
without
offering
to
touch
the
meat
indeed
before
she
was
guilty
of
this
offence
i
have
often
seen
you
stroke
and
caress
her
with
great
affection
and
puss
who
is
by
no
means
of
an
ungrateful
temper
would
always
pur
and
arch
her
tail
as
if
she
was
sensible
of
your
attention
in
a
few
days
after
this
conversation
another
robin
suffering
like
the
former
from
the
inclemency
of
the
season
flew
into
the
house
and
commenced
acquaintance
with
tommy
but
he
who
recollected
the
mournful
fate
of
his
former
bird
would
not
encourage
it
to
any
familiarity
till
he
had
claimed
the
promise
of
mr
barlow
in
order
to
preserve
it
from
danger
mr
barlow
therefore
enticed
the
new
guest
into
a
small
and
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
it
shut
the
door
in
order
to
prevent
his
escaping
he
then
took
a
small
gridiron
such
as
is
used
to
broil
meat
upon
and
having
almost
heated
it
red
hot
placed
it
erect
upon
the
ground
before
the
cage
in
which
the
bird
was
confined
he
then
contrived
to
entice
the
cat
into
the
room
and
observing
that
she
fixed
her
eye
upon
the
bird
which
she
destined
to
become
her
prey
he
withdrew
the
two
little
boys
in
order
to
leave
her
unrestrained
in
her
operations
they
did
not
retire
far
but
observed
her
from
the
door
fix
her
eyes
upon
the
cage
and
begin
to
approach
it
in
silence
bending
her
body
to
the
ground
and
almost
touching
it
as
she
crawled
along
when
she
judged
herself
within
a
proper
distance
she
exerted
all
her
agility
in
a
violent
spring
which
would
probably
have
been
fatal
to
the
bird
had
not
the
gridiron
placed
before
the
cage
received
the
impression
of
her
attack
nor
was
the
disappointment
the
only
punishment
she
was
destined
to
undergo
the
bars
of
the
gridiron
had
been
so
thoroughly
heated
that
in
rushing
against
them
she
felt
herself
burned
in
several
parts
of
her
body
and
retired
from
the
field
of
battle
mewing
dreadfully
and
full
of
pain
and
such
was
the
impression
which
this
adventure
produced
that
from
this
time
she
was
never
again
known
to
attempt
to
destroy
birds
the
coldness
of
the
weather
still
continuing
all
the
wild
animals
began
to
perceive
the
effects
and
compelled
by
hunger
approached
nearer
to
the
habitations
of
man
and
the
places
they
had
been
accustomed
to
avoid
a
multitude
of
hares
the
most
timorous
of
all
animals
were
frequently
seen
scudding
about
the
garden
in
search
of
the
scanty
vegetables
which
the
severity
of
the
season
had
spared
in
a
short
time
they
had
devoured
all
the
green
herbs
which
could
be
found
and
hunger
still
oppressing
them
they
began
to
gnaw
the
very
bark
of
the
trees
for
food
one
day
as
tommy
was
walking
in
the
garden
he
found
that
even
the
beloved
tree
which
he
had
planted
with
his
own
hands
and
from
which
he
had
promised
himself
so
plentiful
a
produce
of
fruit
had
not
escaped
the
general
depredation
but
had
been
gnawed
round
at
the
root
and
killed
tommy
who
could
ill
brook
disappointment
was
so
enraged
to
see
his
labours
prove
abortive
that
he
ran
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
mr
barlow
to
demand
vengeance
against
the
devouring
hares
indeed
said
mr
barlow
i
am
sorry
for
what
they
have
done
but
it
is
now
too
late
to
prevent
it
yes
answered
tommy
but
you
may
have
all
those
mischievous
creatures
shot
that
they
may
do
no
further
damage
a
little
while
ago
replied
mr
barlow
you
wanted
to
destroy
the
cat
because
she
was
cruel
and
preyed
upon
living
animals
and
now
you
would
murder
all
the
hares
merely
because
they
are
innocent
inoffensive
animals
that
subsist
upon
vegetables
tommy
looked
a
little
foolish
but
said
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
them
for
living
upon
vegetables
but
for
destroying
his
tree
but
said
mr
barlow
how
can
you
expect
the
animal
to
distinguish
your
trees
from
any
other
you
should
therefore
have
fenced
them
round
in
such
a
manner
as
might
have
prevented
the
hares
from
reaching
them
besides
in
such
extreme
distress
as
animals
now
suffer
from
the
want
of
food
i
think
they
may
be
forgiven
if
they
trespass
a
little
more
than
usual
mr
barlow
then
took
tommy
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
a
field
at
some
distance
which
belonged
to
him
and
which
was
sown
with
turnips
scarcely
had
they
entered
the
field
before
a
flock
of
larks
rose
up
in
such
innumerable
quantities
as
almost
darkened
the
air
see
said
mr
barlow
these
little
fellows
are
trespassing
upon
my
turnips
in
such
numbers
that
in
a
short
time
they
will
destroy
every
bit
of
green
about
the
field
yet
i
would
not
hurt
them
on
any
account
look
round
the
whole
extent
of
the
country
you
will
see
nothing
but
a
barren
waste
which
presents
no
food
either
to
bird
or
beast
these
little
creatures
therefore
assemble
in
multitudes
here
where
they
find
a
scanty
subsistence
and
though
they
do
me
some
mischief
they
are
welcome
to
what
they
can
find
in
the
spring
they
will
enliven
our
walks
by
their
agreeable
songs
how
dreary
and
uncomfortable
is
this
season
of
winter
i
wish
it
were
always
summer
in
some
countries
it
is
so
but
there
the
inhabitants
complain
more
of
the
intolerable
heat
than
you
do
of
the
cold
they
would
with
pleasure
be
relieved
by
the
agreeable
variety
of
cooler
weather
when
they
are
panting
under
the
violence
of
a
scorching
sun
then
i
should
like
to
live
in
a
country
that
was
never
either
disagreeably
hot
or
cold
such
a
country
is
scarcely
to
be
found
or
if
it
is
contains
so
small
a
portion
of
the
earth
as
to
leave
room
for
very
few
inhabitants
then
i
should
think
it
would
be
so
crowded
that
one
would
hardly
be
able
to
stir
for
everybody
would
naturally
wish
to
live
there
there
you
are
mistaken
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
finest
climates
are
often
less
attached
to
their
own
country
than
those
of
the
worst
custom
reconciles
people
to
every
kind
of
life
and
makes
them
equally
satisfied
with
the
place
in
which
they
are
born
there
is
a
country
called
lapland
which
extends
a
great
deal
further
north
than
any
part
of
england
which
is
covered
with
perpetual
snows
during
all
the
year
yet
the
inhabitants
would
not
exchange
it
for
any
other
portion
of
the
globe
how
do
they
live
in
so
disagreeable
a
country
if
you
ask
harry
he
will
tell
you
being
a
farmer
it
is
his
business
to
study
the
different
methods
by
which
men
find
subsistence
in
all
the
different
parts
of
the
earth
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
if
harry
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
you
must
know
then
master
tommy
that
in
the
greatest
part
of
this
country
which
is
called
lapland
the
inhabitants
neither
sow
nor
reap
they
are
totally
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
corn
and
know
not
how
to
make
bread
they
have
no
trees
which
bear
fruit
and
scarcely
any
of
the
herbs
which
grow
in
our
gardens
in
england
nor
do
they
possess
either
sheep
goats
hogs
cows
or
beasts
that
must
be
a
disagreeable
country
indeed
what
then
have
they
to
live
upon
they
have
a
species
of
deer
which
is
bigger
than
the
largest
stags
which
you
may
have
seen
in
the
gentlemen
parks
in
england
and
very
strong
these
animals
are
called
and
are
of
so
gentle
a
nature
that
they
are
easily
tamed
and
taught
to
live
together
in
herds
and
to
obey
their
masters
in
the
short
summer
which
they
enjoy
the
laplanders
lead
them
out
to
pasture
in
the
valleys
where
the
grass
grows
very
high
and
luxuriant
in
the
winter
when
the
ground
is
all
covered
over
with
snow
the
deer
have
learned
to
scratch
away
the
snow
and
find
a
sort
of
moss
which
grows
underneath
it
and
upon
this
they
subsist
these
creatures
afford
not
only
food
but
raiment
and
even
houses
to
their
masters
in
the
summer
the
laplander
milks
his
herds
and
lives
upon
the
produce
sometimes
he
lays
by
the
milk
in
wooden
vessels
to
serve
him
for
food
in
winter
this
is
soon
frozen
so
hard
that
when
they
would
use
it
they
are
obliged
to
cut
it
in
pieces
with
a
hatchet
sometimes
the
winters
are
so
severe
that
the
poor
deer
can
scarcely
find
even
moss
and
then
the
master
is
obliged
to
kill
part
of
them
and
live
upon
the
flesh
of
the
skins
he
makes
warm
garments
for
himself
and
his
family
and
strews
them
thick
upon
the
ground
to
sleep
upon
their
houses
are
only
poles
stuck
slanting
into
the
ground
and
almost
joined
at
top
except
a
little
hole
which
they
leave
to
let
out
the
smoke
these
poles
are
either
covered
with
the
skins
of
animals
or
coarse
cloth
or
sometimes
with
turf
and
the
bark
of
trees
there
is
a
little
hole
left
in
one
side
through
which
the
family
creep
into
their
tent
and
they
make
a
comfortable
fire
to
warm
them
in
the
middle
people
that
are
so
easily
contented
are
totally
ignorant
of
most
of
the
things
that
are
thought
so
necessary
here
the
laplanders
have
neither
gold
nor
silver
nor
carpets
nor
carved
work
in
their
houses
every
man
makes
for
himself
all
that
the
real
wants
of
life
require
and
with
his
own
hands
performs
everything
which
is
necessary
to
be
done
their
food
consists
either
in
frozen
milk
or
the
flesh
of
the
reindeer
or
that
of
the
bear
which
they
frequently
hunt
and
kill
instead
of
bread
they
strip
off
the
bark
of
firs
which
are
almost
the
only
trees
that
grow
upon
those
dismal
mountains
and
boiling
the
inward
and
more
tender
skin
they
eat
it
with
their
flesh
the
greatest
happiness
of
these
poor
people
is
to
live
free
and
unrestrained
therefore
they
do
not
long
remain
fixed
to
any
spot
but
taking
down
their
houses
they
pack
them
up
along
with
the
little
furniture
they
possess
and
load
them
upon
sledges
to
carry
and
set
them
up
in
some
other
place
have
you
not
said
that
they
have
neither
horses
nor
oxen
do
they
then
draw
these
sledges
themselves
i
thought
i
should
surprise
you
master
tommy
the
reindeer
which
i
have
described
are
so
tractable
that
they
are
harnessed
like
horses
and
draw
the
sledges
with
their
masters
upon
them
nearly
thirty
miles
they
set
out
with
surprising
swiftness
and
run
along
the
snow
which
is
frozen
so
hard
in
winter
that
it
supports
them
like
a
solid
road
in
this
manner
do
the
laplanders
perform
their
journeys
and
change
their
places
of
abode
as
often
as
is
agreeable
in
the
spring
they
lead
their
herds
of
deer
to
pasture
upon
the
mountains
in
the
winter
they
come
down
into
the
plains
where
they
are
better
protected
against
the
fury
of
the
winds
for
the
whole
country
is
waste
and
desolate
destitute
of
all
the
objects
which
you
see
here
there
are
no
towns
nor
villages
no
fields
enclosed
or
cultivated
no
beaten
roads
no
inns
for
travellers
to
sleep
at
no
shops
to
purchase
the
necessaries
or
conveniences
of
life
at
the
face
of
the
whole
country
is
barren
and
dismal
wherever
you
turn
your
eyes
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
lofty
mountains
white
with
snow
and
covered
with
ice
and
fogs
scarcely
any
trees
are
to
be
seen
except
a
few
stunted
firs
and
birches
these
mountains
afford
a
retreat
to
thousands
of
bears
and
wolves
which
are
continually
pouring
down
and
prowling
about
to
prey
upon
the
herds
of
deer
so
that
the
laplanders
are
continually
obliged
to
fight
them
in
their
own
defence
to
do
this
they
fix
large
pieces
of
flat
board
about
four
or
five
feet
long
to
the
bottom
of
their
feet
and
thus
secured
they
run
along
without
sinking
into
the
snow
so
nimbly
that
they
can
overtake
the
wild
animals
in
the
chase
the
bears
they
kill
with
bows
and
arrows
which
they
make
themselves
sometimes
they
find
out
the
dens
where
they
have
laid
themselves
up
in
winter
and
then
they
attack
them
with
spears
and
generally
overcome
them
when
a
laplander
has
killed
a
bear
he
carries
it
home
in
triumph
boils
the
flesh
in
an
iron
pot
which
is
all
the
cooking
they
are
acquainted
with
and
invites
all
his
neighbours
to
the
feast
this
they
account
the
greatest
delicacy
in
the
world
and
particularly
the
fat
which
they
melt
over
the
fire
and
drink
then
sitting
round
the
flame
they
entertain
each
other
with
stories
of
their
own
exploits
in
hunting
or
fishing
till
the
feast
is
over
though
they
live
so
barbarous
a
life
they
are
a
sincere
and
hospitable
people
if
a
stranger
comes
among
them
they
lodge
and
entertain
him
in
the
best
manner
they
are
able
and
generally
refuse
all
payment
for
their
services
unless
it
be
a
little
bit
of
tobacco
which
they
are
immoderately
fond
of
smoking
poor
people
how
i
pity
them
to
live
such
an
unhappy
life
i
should
think
the
fatigues
and
hardships
they
undergo
must
kill
them
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
have
you
then
observed
that
those
who
eat
and
drink
the
most
and
undergo
the
least
fatigue
are
the
most
free
from
disease
not
always
for
i
remember
that
there
are
two
or
three
gentlemen
who
come
to
dine
at
my
father
who
eat
an
amazing
quantity
of
meat
besides
drinking
a
great
deal
of
wine
and
these
poor
gentlemen
have
lost
the
use
of
almost
all
their
limbs
their
legs
are
so
swelled
that
they
are
almost
as
big
as
their
bodies
their
feet
are
so
tender
that
they
can
not
set
them
to
the
ground
and
their
knees
so
stiff
that
they
can
not
bend
them
when
they
arrive
they
are
obliged
to
be
helped
out
of
their
coaches
by
two
or
three
people
and
they
come
hobbling
in
upon
crutches
but
i
never
heard
them
talk
about
anything
but
eating
and
drinking
in
all
my
life
and
did
you
ever
observe
that
any
of
the
poor
had
lost
the
use
of
their
limbs
by
the
same
disease
i
can
not
say
i
have
then
perhaps
the
being
confined
to
a
scanty
diet
to
hardship
and
to
exercise
may
not
be
so
desperate
as
you
imagine
this
way
of
life
is
even
much
less
so
than
the
intemperance
in
which
too
many
of
the
rich
continually
indulge
themselves
i
remember
lately
reading
a
story
on
this
subject
which
if
you
please
you
shall
hear
mr
barlow
then
read
the
following
history
of
a
surprising
cure
of
the
gout
in
one
of
the
provinces
of
italy
there
lived
a
wealthy
gentleman
who
having
no
taste
either
for
improving
his
mind
or
exercising
his
body
acquired
a
habit
of
eating
almost
all
day
long
the
whole
extent
of
his
thoughts
was
what
he
should
eat
for
dinner
and
how
he
should
procure
the
greatest
delicacies
italy
produces
excellent
wine
but
these
were
not
enough
for
our
epicure
he
settled
agents
in
different
parts
of
france
and
spain
to
buy
up
all
the
most
generous
and
costly
wines
of
those
countries
he
had
correspondence
with
all
the
maritime
cities
that
he
might
be
constantly
supplied
with
every
species
of
fish
every
poulterer
and
fishmonger
in
the
town
was
under
articles
to
let
him
have
his
choice
of
rarities
he
also
employed
a
man
on
purpose
to
give
directions
for
his
pastry
and
desserts
as
soon
as
he
had
breakfasted
in
the
morning
it
was
his
constant
practice
to
retire
to
his
library
for
he
too
had
a
library
although
he
never
opened
a
book
when
he
was
there
he
gravely
seated
himself
in
an
easy
chair
and
tucking
a
napkin
under
his
chin
ordered
his
head
cook
to
be
sent
in
to
him
the
head
cook
instantly
appeared
attended
by
a
couple
of
footmen
who
carried
each
a
silver
salver
of
prodigious
size
on
which
were
cups
containing
sauces
of
every
different
flavour
which
could
be
devised
the
gentleman
with
the
greatest
solemnity
used
to
dip
a
bit
of
bread
in
each
and
taste
it
giving
his
orders
upon
the
subject
with
as
much
earnestness
and
precision
as
if
he
had
been
signing
papers
for
the
government
of
a
kingdom
when
this
important
affair
was
thus
concluded
he
would
throw
himself
upon
a
couch
to
repair
the
fatigues
of
such
an
exertion
and
refresh
himself
against
dinner
when
that
delightful
hour
arrived
it
is
impossible
to
describe
either
the
variety
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
which
was
set
before
him
or
the
surprising
greediness
with
which
he
ate
of
all
stimulating
his
appetite
with
the
highest
sauces
and
richest
wines
till
at
length
he
was
obliged
to
desist
not
from
being
satisfied
but
from
mere
inability
to
contain
more
this
kind
of
life
he
had
long
pursued
but
at
last
became
so
corpulent
that
he
could
hardly
move
his
belly
appeared
prominent
like
a
mountain
his
face
was
bloated
and
his
legs
though
swelled
to
the
size
of
columns
seemed
unable
to
support
the
prodigious
weight
of
his
body
added
to
this
he
was
troubled
with
continual
indigestions
and
racking
pains
in
several
of
his
limbs
which
at
length
terminated
in
a
violent
fit
of
the
gout
the
pains
indeed
at
length
abated
and
this
unfortunate
epicure
returned
to
all
his
former
habits
of
intemperance
the
interval
of
ease
however
was
short
and
the
attacks
of
his
disease
becoming
more
and
more
frequent
he
was
at
length
deprived
of
the
use
of
almost
all
his
limbs
in
this
unhappy
state
he
determined
to
consult
a
physician
that
lived
in
the
same
town
and
had
the
reputation
of
performing
many
surprising
cures
said
the
gentleman
to
the
physician
when
he
arrived
see
the
miserable
state
to
which
i
am
reduced
do
indeed
answered
the
physician
i
suppose
you
have
contributed
to
it
by
your
intemperance
to
intemperance
replied
the
gentleman
believe
few
have
less
to
answer
for
than
myself
i
indeed
love
a
moderate
dinner
and
supper
but
i
never
was
intoxicated
with
liquor
in
my
life
then
you
sleep
too
much
said
the
physician
to
sleep
said
the
gentleman
am
in
bed
nearly
twelve
hours
every
night
because
i
find
the
sharpness
of
the
morning
air
extremely
injurious
to
my
constitution
but
i
am
so
troubled
with
a
plaguy
flatulency
and
heartburn
that
i
am
scarcely
able
to
close
my
eyes
all
night
or
if
i
do
i
find
myself
almost
strangled
with
wind
and
awake
in
agonies
is
a
very
alarming
symptom
indeed
replied
the
doctor
wonder
so
many
restless
nights
do
not
entirely
wear
you
out
would
indeed
answered
the
gentleman
i
did
not
make
shift
to
procure
a
little
sleep
two
or
three
times
which
enables
me
to
hold
out
a
little
longer
to
exercise
continued
the
doctor
fear
you
are
not
able
to
use
a
great
deal
answered
the
sick
man
i
was
able
i
never
failed
to
go
out
in
my
carriage
once
or
twice
but
in
my
present
situation
i
can
no
longer
bear
the
gentlest
motion
besides
disordering
my
whole
frame
it
gives
me
such
intolerable
twitches
in
my
limbs
that
you
would
imagine
i
was
absolutely
falling
to
pieces
case
answered
the
physician
indeed
bad
but
not
quite
desperate
and
if
you
could
abridge
the
quantity
of
your
food
and
sleep
you
would
in
a
short
time
find
yourself
much
better
answered
the
sick
man
find
you
little
know
the
delicacy
of
my
constitution
or
you
would
not
put
me
upon
a
method
which
will
infallibly
destroy
me
when
i
rise
in
the
morning
i
feel
as
if
all
the
powers
of
life
were
extinguished
within
me
my
stomach
is
oppressed
with
nausea
my
head
with
aches
and
swimming
and
above
all
i
feel
such
an
intolerable
sinking
in
my
spirits
that
without
the
assistance
of
two
or
three
cordials
and
some
restorative
soup
i
am
confident
i
never
could
get
through
the
morning
now
doctor
i
have
such
confidence
in
your
skill
that
there
is
no
pill
or
potion
you
can
order
me
which
i
will
not
take
with
pleasure
but
as
to
a
change
in
my
diet
that
is
impossible
is
answered
the
physician
wish
for
health
without
being
at
the
trouble
of
acquiring
it
and
imagine
that
all
the
consequences
of
an
life
are
to
be
washed
away
by
a
julep
or
a
decoction
of
senna
but
as
i
can
not
cure
you
upon
those
terms
i
will
not
deceive
you
for
an
instant
your
case
is
out
of
the
power
of
medicine
and
you
can
only
be
relieved
by
your
own
exertions
hard
is
this
answered
the
gentleman
be
thus
abandoned
to
despair
even
in
the
prime
of
life
cruel
and
unfeeling
doctor
will
you
not
attempt
anything
to
procure
me
ease
answered
the
physician
have
already
told
you
everything
i
know
upon
the
subject
i
must
however
acquaint
you
that
i
have
a
brother
physician
who
lives
at
padua
a
man
of
the
greatest
learning
and
integrity
who
is
particularly
famous
for
curing
the
gout
if
you
think
it
worth
your
while
to
consult
him
i
will
give
you
a
letter
of
recommendation
for
he
never
stirs
from
home
even
to
attend
a
prince
here
the
conversation
ended
for
the
gentleman
who
did
not
like
the
trouble
of
the
journey
took
his
leave
of
the
physician
and
returned
home
very
much
dispirited
in
a
little
while
he
either
was
or
fancied
himself
worse
and
as
the
idea
of
the
paduan
physician
had
never
left
his
head
he
at
last
resolutely
determined
to
set
out
upon
the
journey
for
this
purpose
he
had
a
litter
so
contrived
that
he
could
lie
recumbent
or
recline
at
his
ease
and
eat
his
meals
the
distance
was
not
above
one
day
tolerable
journey
but
the
gentleman
wisely
resolved
to
make
four
of
it
for
fear
of
himself
he
had
besides
a
loaded
waggon
attending
filled
with
everything
that
constitutes
good
eating
and
two
of
his
cooks
went
with
him
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
to
his
accommodation
on
the
road
after
a
wearisome
journey
he
at
length
arrived
within
sight
of
padua
and
eagerly
inquiring
after
the
house
of
doctor
ramozini
was
soon
directed
to
the
spot
then
having
been
helped
out
of
his
carriage
by
of
his
servants
he
was
shown
into
a
neat
but
plain
parlour
from
which
he
had
the
prospect
of
twenty
or
thirty
people
at
dinner
in
a
spacious
hall
in
the
middle
of
them
was
the
learned
doctor
himself
who
with
much
complaisance
invited
the
company
to
eat
heartily
good
friend
said
the
doctor
to
a
man
on
his
right
hand
must
eat
three
slices
more
of
this
or
you
will
never
lose
your
ague
friend
said
he
to
another
off
this
glass
of
porter
it
is
just
arrived
from
england
and
is
a
specific
for
nervous
fevers
not
stuff
your
child
so
with
macaroni
added
he
turning
to
a
woman
you
wish
to
cure
him
of
the
scrofula
man
said
he
to
a
fourth
goes
on
the
ulcer
in
your
leg
better
indeed
replied
the
man
i
have
lived
at
your
table
replied
the
physician
a
fortnight
you
will
be
perfectly
cured
if
you
do
but
drink
wine
enough
heaven
said
the
gentleman
who
had
heard
all
this
with
infinite
pleasure
have
at
last
met
with
a
reasonable
physician
he
will
not
confine
me
to
bread
and
water
nor
starve
me
under
pretence
of
curing
me
like
that
confounded
quack
from
whose
clutches
i
have
so
luckily
escaped
at
length
the
doctor
dismissed
his
company
who
retired
loading
him
with
thanks
and
blessings
he
then
approached
the
gentleman
and
welcomed
him
with
the
greatest
politeness
who
presented
him
with
his
letters
of
recommendation
which
after
the
physician
had
perused
he
thus
accosted
him
the
letter
of
my
learned
friend
has
fully
instructed
me
in
the
particulars
of
your
case
it
is
indeed
a
difficult
one
but
i
think
you
have
no
reason
to
despair
of
a
perfect
recovery
if
added
he
choose
to
put
yourself
under
my
care
i
will
employ
all
the
secrets
of
my
art
for
your
assistance
but
one
condition
is
absolutely
indispensable
you
must
send
away
all
your
servants
and
solemnly
engage
to
follow
my
prescriptions
for
at
least
a
month
without
this
compliance
i
would
not
undertake
the
cure
even
of
a
monarch
answered
the
gentleman
i
have
seen
of
your
profession
does
not
i
confess
much
prejudice
me
in
their
favour
and
i
should
hesitate
to
agree
to
such
a
proposal
from
any
other
individual
as
you
like
sir
answered
the
physician
employing
me
or
not
is
entirely
voluntary
on
your
part
but
as
i
am
above
the
common
mercenary
views
of
gain
i
never
stake
the
reputation
of
so
noble
an
art
without
a
rational
prospect
of
success
and
what
success
can
i
hope
for
in
so
obstinate
a
disorder
unless
the
patient
will
consent
to
a
fair
experiment
of
what
i
can
effect
replied
the
gentleman
you
say
is
so
candid
and
your
whole
behaviour
so
much
interests
me
in
your
favour
that
i
will
immediately
give
you
proofs
of
the
most
unbounded
confidence
he
then
sent
for
his
servants
and
ordered
them
to
return
home
and
not
to
come
near
him
till
a
whole
month
was
elapsed
when
they
were
gone
the
physician
asked
him
how
he
supported
the
journey
really
answered
he
better
than
i
could
have
expected
but
i
feel
myself
unusually
hungry
and
therefore
with
your
permission
shall
beg
to
have
the
hour
of
supper
a
little
hastened
willingly
answered
the
doctor
eight
everything
shall
be
ready
for
your
entertainment
in
the
meantime
you
will
permit
me
to
visit
my
patients
while
the
physician
was
absent
the
gentleman
was
pleasing
his
imagination
with
the
thoughts
of
the
excellent
supper
he
should
make
said
he
to
himself
signor
ramozini
treats
the
poor
in
such
an
hospitable
manner
he
will
spare
nothing
for
the
entertainment
of
a
man
of
my
importance
i
have
heard
there
are
delicious
trouts
and
ortolans
in
this
part
of
italy
i
make
no
doubt
but
the
doctor
keeps
an
excellent
cook
and
i
shall
have
no
reason
to
repent
the
dismission
of
my
servants
with
these
ideas
he
kept
himself
some
time
amused
at
length
his
appetite
growing
keener
and
keener
every
instant
from
fasting
longer
than
ordinary
he
lost
all
patience
and
calling
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
inquired
for
some
little
nice
thing
to
stay
his
stomach
till
the
hour
of
supper
said
the
servant
would
gladly
oblige
you
but
it
is
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
my
master
is
the
best
and
most
generous
of
men
but
so
great
is
his
attention
to
his
house
patients
that
he
will
not
suffer
one
of
them
to
eat
unless
in
his
presence
however
sir
have
patience
in
two
hours
more
the
supper
will
be
ready
and
then
you
may
indemnify
yourself
for
all
thus
was
the
gentleman
compelled
to
pass
two
hours
more
without
food
a
degree
of
abstinence
he
had
not
practised
for
almost
twenty
years
he
complained
bitterly
of
the
slowness
of
time
and
was
continually
inquiring
what
was
the
hour
at
length
the
doctor
returned
punctual
to
his
time
and
ordered
the
supper
to
be
brought
in
accordingly
six
dishes
were
set
upon
the
table
with
great
solemnity
all
under
cover
and
the
gentleman
flattered
himself
he
should
now
be
rewarded
for
his
long
abstinence
as
they
were
sitting
down
to
table
the
learned
ramozini
thus
accosted
his
guest
you
give
a
loose
to
your
appetite
sir
i
must
acquaint
you
that
as
the
most
effectual
method
of
subduing
this
obstinate
disease
all
your
food
and
drink
will
be
mixed
up
with
such
medicinal
substances
as
your
case
requires
they
will
not
be
indeed
discoverable
by
any
of
your
senses
but
as
their
effects
are
equally
strong
and
certain
i
must
recommend
to
you
to
eat
with
moderation
having
said
this
he
ordered
the
dishes
to
be
uncovered
which
to
the
extreme
astonishment
of
the
gentleman
contained
nothing
but
olives
dried
figs
dates
some
roasted
apples
a
few
boiled
eggs
and
a
piece
of
hard
cheese
and
earth
cried
the
gentleman
losing
all
patience
at
this
mortifying
spectacle
this
the
entertainment
you
have
prepared
for
me
with
so
many
speeches
and
prefaces
do
you
imagine
that
a
person
of
my
fortune
can
sup
on
such
contemptible
fare
as
would
hardly
satisfy
the
wretched
peasants
whom
i
saw
at
dinner
in
your
hall
patience
my
dear
sir
replied
the
physician
is
the
extreme
anxiety
i
have
for
your
welfare
that
compels
me
to
treat
you
with
this
apparent
incivility
your
blood
is
all
in
a
ferment
with
the
violent
exercise
you
have
undergone
and
were
i
rashly
to
indulge
your
craving
appetite
a
fever
or
a
pleurisy
might
be
the
consequence
but
i
hope
you
will
be
cooler
and
then
you
may
live
in
a
style
more
adapted
to
your
quality
the
gentleman
began
to
comfort
himself
with
this
reflection
and
as
there
was
no
help
he
at
last
determined
to
wait
with
patience
another
night
he
accordingly
tasted
a
few
of
the
dates
and
olives
ate
a
piece
of
cheese
with
a
slice
of
excellent
bread
and
found
himself
more
refreshed
than
he
could
have
imagined
was
possible
from
such
a
homely
meal
when
he
had
nearly
supped
he
wanted
something
to
drink
and
observing
nothing
but
water
upon
the
table
desired
one
of
the
servants
to
bring
him
a
little
wine
as
you
value
the
life
of
this
illustrious
gentleman
cried
out
the
physician
added
he
turning
to
his
guest
is
with
inexpressible
reluctance
that
i
contradict
you
but
wine
would
be
at
present
a
mortal
poison
therefore
please
to
content
yourself
for
one
night
only
with
a
glass
of
this
most
excellent
and
refreshing
mineral
water
the
gentleman
was
again
compelled
to
submit
and
drank
the
water
with
a
variety
of
strange
grimaces
after
the
cloth
was
removed
signor
ramozini
entertained
the
gentleman
with
some
agreeable
and
improving
conversation
for
about
an
hour
and
then
proposed
to
his
patient
that
he
should
retire
to
rest
this
proposal
the
gentleman
gladly
accepted
as
he
found
himself
fatigued
with
his
journey
and
unusually
disposed
to
sleep
the
doctor
then
retired
and
ordered
one
of
his
servants
to
show
the
gentleman
to
his
chamber
he
was
accordingly
conducted
into
a
neighbouring
room
where
there
was
little
to
be
seen
but
a
homely
bed
without
furniture
with
nothing
to
sleep
upon
but
a
mattress
almost
as
hard
as
the
floor
at
this
the
gentleman
burst
into
a
violent
passion
again
said
he
to
the
servant
is
impossible
your
master
should
dare
to
confine
me
to
such
a
wretched
show
me
into
another
room
immediately
answered
the
servant
with
profound
humility
am
heartily
sorry
the
chamber
does
not
please
you
but
i
am
morally
certain
i
have
not
mistaken
my
master
order
and
i
have
too
great
a
respect
for
you
to
think
of
disobeying
him
in
a
point
which
concerns
your
precious
life
saying
this
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
shutting
the
door
on
the
outside
left
the
gentleman
to
his
meditations
they
were
not
very
agreeable
at
first
however
as
he
saw
no
remedy
he
undressed
himself
and
entered
the
wretched
bed
where
he
presently
fell
asleep
while
he
was
meditating
revenge
upon
the
doctor
and
his
whole
family
the
gentleman
slept
so
soundly
that
he
did
not
awake
till
morning
and
then
the
physician
came
into
his
room
and
with
the
greatest
tenderness
and
civility
inquired
after
his
health
he
had
indeed
fallen
asleep
in
very
but
his
night
rest
had
much
composed
his
mind
and
the
effect
of
this
was
increased
by
the
extreme
politeness
of
the
doctor
so
that
he
answered
with
tolerable
temper
only
making
bitter
complaints
of
the
homeliness
of
his
accommodation
dearest
sir
answered
the
physician
i
not
make
a
previous
agreement
with
you
that
you
should
submit
to
my
management
can
you
imagine
that
i
have
any
other
end
in
view
than
the
improvement
of
your
health
it
is
not
possible
that
you
should
in
everything
perceive
the
reasons
of
my
conduct
which
is
founded
upon
the
most
accurate
theory
and
experience
however
in
this
case
i
must
inform
you
that
i
have
found
out
the
art
of
making
my
very
beds
medicinal
and
this
you
must
confess
from
the
excellent
night
you
have
passed
i
can
not
impart
the
same
salutary
virtues
to
down
or
silk
and
therefore
though
very
much
against
my
inclinations
i
have
been
compelled
to
lodge
you
in
this
homely
manner
but
now
if
you
please
it
is
time
to
rise
ramozini
then
rang
for
the
servants
and
the
gentleman
suffered
himself
to
be
dressed
at
breakfast
the
gentleman
expected
to
fare
a
little
better
but
his
relentless
guardian
would
suffer
him
to
taste
nothing
but
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
porringer
of
all
which
he
defended
very
little
to
his
guest
satisfaction
upon
the
most
unerring
principles
of
medical
science
after
breakfast
had
been
some
time
finished
dr
ramozini
told
his
patient
it
was
time
to
begin
the
great
work
of
restoring
him
to
the
use
of
his
limbs
he
accordingly
had
him
carried
into
a
little
room
where
he
desired
the
gentleman
to
attempt
to
stand
is
impossible
answered
the
patient
i
have
not
been
able
to
use
a
leg
these
three
years
yourself
then
upon
your
crutches
and
lean
against
the
wall
to
support
yourself
answered
the
physician
the
gentleman
did
so
and
the
doctor
went
abruptly
out
and
locked
the
door
after
him
he
had
not
been
long
in
this
situation
before
he
felt
the
floor
of
the
chamber
which
he
had
not
before
perceived
to
be
composed
of
plates
of
iron
grow
immoderately
hot
under
his
feet
he
called
the
doctor
and
his
servants
but
to
no
purpose
he
then
began
to
utter
loud
vociferations
and
menaces
but
all
was
equally
ineffectual
he
raved
he
swore
he
promised
he
entreated
but
nobody
came
to
his
assistance
and
the
heat
grew
more
intense
every
instant
at
length
necessity
compelled
him
to
hop
upon
one
leg
in
order
to
rest
the
other
and
this
he
did
with
greater
agility
than
he
could
conceive
was
possible
presently
the
other
leg
began
to
burn
and
then
he
hopped
again
upon
the
other
thus
he
went
on
hopping
about
with
this
involuntary
exercise
till
he
had
stretched
every
sinew
and
muscle
more
than
he
had
done
for
several
years
before
and
thrown
himself
into
a
profuse
perspiration
when
the
doctor
was
satisfied
with
the
exertions
of
his
patient
he
sent
into
the
floor
an
easy
chair
for
him
to
rest
upon
and
suffered
the
floor
to
cool
as
gradually
as
it
had
been
heated
then
it
was
that
the
sick
man
for
the
first
time
began
to
be
sensible
of
the
real
use
and
pleasure
of
repose
he
had
earned
it
by
fatigue
without
which
it
can
never
prove
either
salutary
or
agreeable
at
dinner
the
doctor
appeared
again
to
his
patient
and
made
him
a
thousand
apologies
for
the
liberties
he
had
taken
with
his
person
these
excuses
he
received
with
a
kind
of
sullen
civility
however
his
anger
was
a
little
mitigated
by
the
smell
of
a
roasted
pullet
which
was
brought
to
table
and
set
before
him
he
now
from
exercise
and
abstinence
began
to
find
a
relish
in
his
victuals
which
he
had
never
done
before
and
the
doctor
permitted
him
to
mingle
a
little
wine
with
his
water
these
compliances
however
were
so
extremely
irksome
to
his
temper
that
the
month
seemed
to
pass
away
as
slowly
as
a
year
when
it
was
expired
and
his
servants
came
to
ask
his
orders
he
instantly
threw
himself
into
his
carriage
without
taking
leave
either
of
the
doctor
or
his
family
when
he
came
to
reflect
upon
the
treatment
he
had
received
his
forced
exercises
his
involuntary
abstinence
and
all
the
other
mortifications
he
had
undergone
he
could
not
conceive
but
it
must
be
a
plot
of
the
physician
he
had
left
behind
and
full
of
rage
and
indignation
drove
directly
to
his
house
in
order
to
reproach
him
with
it
the
physician
happened
to
be
at
home
but
scarcely
knew
his
patient
again
though
after
so
short
an
absence
he
had
shrunk
to
half
his
former
bulk
his
look
and
colour
were
mended
and
he
had
entirely
thrown
away
his
crutches
when
he
had
given
vent
to
all
that
his
anger
could
suggest
the
physician
coolly
answered
in
the
following
manner
know
not
sir
what
right
you
have
to
make
me
these
reproaches
since
it
was
not
by
my
persuasion
that
you
put
yourself
under
the
care
of
doctor
ramozini
sir
but
you
gave
me
a
high
character
of
his
skill
and
integrity
he
then
deceived
you
in
either
or
do
you
find
yourself
worse
than
when
you
put
yourself
under
his
care
can
not
say
that
answered
the
gentleman
am
to
be
sure
surprisingly
improved
in
my
digestion
i
sleep
better
than
ever
i
did
before
i
eat
with
an
appetite
and
i
can
walk
almost
as
well
as
ever
i
could
in
my
life
do
you
seriously
come
said
the
physician
complain
of
a
man
that
has
affected
all
these
miracles
for
you
in
so
short
a
time
and
unless
you
are
now
wanting
to
yourself
has
given
you
a
degree
of
life
and
health
which
you
had
not
the
smallest
reason
to
expect
the
gentleman
who
had
not
sufficiently
considered
all
these
advantages
began
to
look
a
little
confused
and
the
physician
thus
went
on
that
you
have
to
complain
of
is
that
you
have
been
involuntarily
your
own
dupe
and
cheated
into
health
and
happiness
you
went
to
dr
ramozini
and
saw
a
parcel
of
miserable
wretches
comfortably
at
dinner
that
great
and
worthy
man
is
the
father
of
all
about
him
he
knows
that
most
of
the
diseases
of
the
poor
originate
in
their
want
of
food
and
necessaries
and
therefore
benevolently
assists
them
with
better
diet
and
clothing
the
rich
on
the
contrary
are
generally
the
victims
of
their
own
sloth
and
intemperance
and
therefore
he
finds
it
necessary
to
use
a
contrary
method
of
cure
exercise
abstinence
and
mortification
you
sir
have
indeed
been
treated
like
a
child
but
it
has
been
for
your
own
advantage
neither
your
bed
nor
meat
nor
drink
has
ever
been
medicated
all
the
wonderful
change
that
has
been
produced
has
been
by
giving
you
better
habits
and
rousing
the
slumbering
powers
of
your
own
constitution
as
to
deception
you
have
none
to
complain
of
except
what
proceeded
from
your
own
foolish
imagination
which
persuaded
you
that
a
physician
was
to
regulate
his
conduct
by
the
folly
and
intemperance
of
his
patient
as
to
all
the
rest
he
only
promised
to
exert
all
the
secrets
of
his
art
for
your
cure
and
this
i
am
witness
he
has
done
so
effectually
that
were
you
to
reward
him
with
half
your
fortune
it
would
hardly
be
too
much
for
his
deserts
the
gentleman
who
did
not
want
either
sense
or
generosity
could
not
help
feeling
the
force
of
what
was
said
he
therefore
made
a
handsome
apology
for
his
behaviour
and
instantly
despatched
a
servant
to
dr
ramozini
with
a
handsome
present
and
a
letter
expressing
the
highest
gratitude
and
so
much
satisfaction
did
he
find
in
the
amendment
of
his
health
and
spirits
that
he
never
again
relapsed
into
his
former
habits
of
intemperance
but
by
constant
exercise
and
uniform
moderation
continued
free
from
any
considerable
disease
to
a
very
comfortable
old
age
indeed
said
tommy
this
is
a
very
diverting
comical
story
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
tell
it
to
the
gouty
gentlemen
that
come
to
our
house
that
answered
mr
barlow
would
be
highly
improper
unless
you
were
particularly
desired
those
gentlemen
can
not
be
ignorant
that
such
unbounded
indulgence
of
their
appetites
can
only
tend
to
increase
the
disease
and
therefore
you
could
teach
them
nothing
new
on
the
subject
but
it
would
appear
highly
improper
for
such
a
little
boy
as
you
to
take
upon
him
to
instruct
others
while
he
all
the
time
wants
so
much
instruction
himself
thus
continued
mr
barlow
you
see
by
this
story
which
is
applicable
to
half
the
rich
in
most
countries
that
intemperance
and
excess
are
fully
as
dangerous
as
want
and
hardships
as
to
the
laplanders
whom
you
were
in
so
much
pain
about
they
are
some
of
the
healthiest
people
whom
the
world
produces
they
generally
live
to
an
extremely
old
age
free
from
all
the
common
diseases
which
we
are
acquainted
with
and
subject
to
no
other
inconveniency
than
blindness
which
is
supposed
to
arise
from
the
continual
prospect
of
snow
and
the
constant
smoke
with
which
they
are
surrounded

some
few
days
after
this
conversation
when
the
snow
had
nearly
disappeared
though
the
frost
and
cold
continued
the
two
little
boys
went
out
to
take
a
walk
insensibly
they
wandered
so
far
that
they
scarcely
knew
their
way
and
therefore
resolved
to
return
as
speedily
as
possible
but
unfortunately
in
passing
through
a
wood
they
entirely
missed
the
track
and
lost
themselves
to
add
to
their
distress
the
wind
began
to
blow
most
bitterly
from
the
north
and
a
violent
shower
of
snow
coming
on
obliged
them
to
seek
the
thickest
shelter
they
could
find
they
happened
fortunately
to
be
near
an
aged
oak
the
inside
of
which
gradually
decaying
was
worn
away
by
time
and
afforded
an
ample
opening
to
shelter
them
from
the
storm
into
this
the
two
little
boys
crept
safe
and
endeavoured
to
keep
each
other
warm
while
a
violent
shower
of
snow
and
sleet
fell
all
around
and
gradually
covered
the
earth
tommy
who
had
been
little
used
to
hardships
bore
it
for
some
time
with
fortitude
and
without
uttering
a
complaint
at
length
hunger
and
fear
took
entire
possession
of
his
soul
and
turning
to
harry
with
watery
eyes
and
a
mournful
voice
he
asked
him
what
they
should
do
do
said
harry
we
must
wait
here
i
think
till
the
weather
clears
up
a
little
and
then
we
will
endeavour
to
find
the
way
home
but
what
if
the
weather
should
not
clear
up
at
all
in
that
case
we
must
either
endeavour
to
find
our
way
through
the
snow
or
stay
here
where
we
are
so
conveniently
sheltered
but
oh
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
is
to
be
here
all
alone
in
this
dreary
wood
and
then
i
am
so
hungry
and
so
cold
oh
that
we
had
but
a
little
fire
to
warm
us
i
have
heard
that
shipwrecked
persons
when
they
have
been
cast
away
upon
a
desert
coast
have
made
a
fire
to
warm
themselves
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
wood
together
till
they
caught
fire
or
here
is
a
better
thing
i
have
a
large
knife
in
my
pocket
and
if
i
could
but
find
a
piece
of
flint
i
could
easily
strike
fire
with
the
back
of
it
harry
then
searched
about
and
after
some
time
found
a
couple
of
flints
though
not
without
much
difficulty
as
the
ground
was
nearly
hidden
with
snow
he
then
took
the
flints
and
striking
one
upon
the
other
with
all
his
force
he
shivered
them
into
several
pieces
out
of
those
he
chose
the
thinnest
and
sharpest
and
telling
tommy
with
a
smile
that
he
believed
that
would
do
he
struck
it
several
times
against
the
back
of
his
knife
and
thus
produced
several
sparks
of
fire
this
said
harry
will
be
sufficient
to
light
a
fire
if
we
can
but
find
something
of
a
sufficiently
combustible
nature
to
kindle
from
these
sparks
he
then
collected
the
driest
leaves
he
could
find
with
little
decayed
pieces
of
wood
and
piling
them
into
a
heap
endeavoured
to
kindle
a
blaze
by
the
sparks
which
he
continually
struck
from
his
knife
and
the
flint
but
it
was
in
vain
the
leaves
were
not
of
a
sufficiently
combustible
nature
and
while
he
wearied
himself
in
vain
they
were
not
at
all
the
more
advanced
tommy
who
beheld
the
ill
success
of
his
friend
began
to
be
more
and
more
terrified
and
in
despair
asked
harry
again
what
they
should
do
harry
answered
that
as
they
had
failed
in
their
attempt
to
warm
themselves
the
best
thing
they
could
do
was
to
endeavour
to
find
their
way
home
more
especially
as
the
snow
had
now
ceased
and
the
sky
was
become
much
clearer
this
tommy
consented
to
and
with
infinite
difficulty
they
began
their
march
for
as
the
snow
had
completely
covered
every
tract
and
the
daylight
began
to
fail
they
wandered
at
random
through
a
vast
and
pathless
wood
at
every
step
which
tommy
took
he
sank
almost
to
his
knees
in
snow
the
wind
was
bleak
and
cold
and
it
was
with
much
difficulty
that
harry
could
prevail
upon
him
to
continue
his
journey
at
length
however
as
they
thus
pursued
their
way
with
infinite
toil
they
came
to
some
lighted
embers
which
either
some
labourers
or
some
wandering
passenger
had
lately
quitted
and
which
were
yet
unextinguished
see
said
harry
with
joy
see
what
a
lucky
chance
is
this
here
is
a
fire
ready
lighted
for
us
which
needs
only
the
assistance
of
a
little
wood
to
make
it
burn
harry
again
collected
all
the
dry
pieces
he
could
find
and
piled
them
upon
the
embers
which
in
a
few
minutes
began
to
blaze
and
diffused
a
cheerful
warmth
tommy
then
began
to
warm
and
chafe
his
almost
frozen
limbs
over
the
fire
with
infinite
delight
at
length
he
could
not
help
observing
to
harry
that
he
never
could
have
believed
that
a
few
dried
sticks
could
have
been
of
so
much
consequence
to
him
ah
answered
harry
master
tommy
you
have
been
brought
up
in
such
a
manner
that
you
never
knew
what
it
was
to
want
anything
but
that
is
not
the
case
with
thousands
and
millions
of
people
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
poor
children
that
have
neither
bread
to
eat
fire
to
warm
nor
clothes
to
cover
them
only
think
then
what
a
disagreeable
situation
they
must
be
in
yet
they
are
so
accustomed
to
hardship
that
they
do
not
cry
in
a
twelvemonth
as
much
as
you
have
done
within
this
quarter
of
an
hour
why
answered
tommy
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
observation
of
his
crying
it
can
not
be
expected
that
gentlemen
should
be
able
to
bear
all
these
inconveniences
as
well
as
the
poor
why
not
answered
harry
is
not
a
gentleman
as
much
a
man
as
the
poor
can
be
and
if
he
is
a
man
should
he
not
accustom
himself
to
support
everything
that
his
do
that
is
very
true
but
he
will
have
all
the
conveniences
of
life
provided
for
him
victuals
to
eat
a
good
warm
bed
and
a
fire
to
warm
him
but
he
is
not
sure
of
having
all
these
things
as
long
as
he
lives
besides
i
have
often
observed
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
our
neighbourhood
riding
about
in
coaches
and
covered
from
head
to
foot
yet
shaking
with
the
least
breath
of
air
as
if
they
all
had
agues
while
the
children
of
the
poor
run
about
barefooted
upon
the
ice
and
divert
themselves
with
making
that
is
indeed
true
for
i
have
seen
my
mother
visitors
sitting
over
the
largest
fire
that
could
be
made
and
complaining
of
cold
while
the
labourers
out
of
doors
were
stripped
to
their
shirts
to
work
and
never
minded
it
in
the
least
then
i
should
think
that
exercise
by
which
a
person
can
warm
himself
when
he
pleases
is
an
infinitely
better
thing
than
all
these
conveniences
you
speak
of
because
after
all
they
will
not
hinder
a
person
from
being
cold
but
exercise
will
warm
him
in
an
instant
but
then
it
is
not
proper
for
gentlemen
to
do
the
same
kind
of
work
with
the
common
people
but
is
it
not
proper
for
a
gentleman
to
have
his
body
stout
and
hardy
to
be
sure
it
is
why
then
he
must
sometimes
labour
and
use
his
limbs
or
else
he
will
never
be
able
to
do
it
what
can
not
a
person
be
strong
without
working
you
can
judge
for
yourself
you
very
often
have
fine
young
gentlemen
at
your
father
house
and
are
any
of
them
as
strong
as
the
sons
of
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
who
are
always
used
to
handle
a
hoe
a
spade
a
fork
and
other
tools
indeed
i
believe
that
is
true
for
i
think
i
am
become
stronger
myself
since
i
have
learned
to
divert
myself
in
mr
garden
as
they
were
conversing
in
this
manner
a
little
boy
came
singing
along
with
a
bundle
of
sticks
at
his
back
and
as
soon
as
harry
saw
him
he
recollected
him
and
cried
out
as
i
am
alive
here
as
i
am
is
jack
smithers
the
little
ragged
boy
that
you
gave
the
clothes
to
in
the
summer
he
lives
i
dare
say
in
the
neighbourhood
and
either
he
or
his
father
will
now
show
us
the
way
home
illustration
as
i
am
alive
here
is
jack
smithers
the
little
ragged
boy
that
you
gave
the
clothes
to
in
the
summer
harry
then
spoke
to
the
boy
and
asked
him
if
he
could
show
them
the
way
out
of
the
wood
yes
surely
i
can
answered
the
boy
but
i
never
should
have
thought
of
seeing
master
merton
out
so
late
in
such
a
tempestuous
night
as
this
but
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
my
cottage
you
may
warm
yourself
at
our
fire
and
father
will
run
to
mr
barlow
to
let
him
know
you
are
safe
tommy
accepted
the
offer
with
joy
and
the
little
boy
led
them
out
of
the
wood
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
to
a
small
cottage
which
stood
by
the
side
of
the
road
which
when
they
entered
they
saw
a
woman
busy
in
spinning
the
eldest
girl
was
cooking
some
broth
over
the
fire
the
father
was
sitting
in
the
and
reading
a
book
while
three
or
four
ragged
children
were
tumbling
upon
the
floor
and
creeping
between
their
father
legs
daddy
said
the
little
boy
as
he
came
in
here
is
master
merton
who
was
so
good
to
us
all
in
the
summer
he
has
lost
his
way
in
the
wood
and
is
almost
perished
in
the
snow
the
man
upon
this
arose
and
with
much
civility
desired
the
two
little
boys
to
seat
themselves
by
the
fire
while
the
good
woman
ran
to
fetch
her
largest
faggot
which
she
threw
upon
the
fire
and
created
a
cheerful
blaze
in
an
instant
there
my
dear
little
master
said
she
you
may
at
least
refresh
yourself
by
our
fire
and
i
wish
i
had
anything
to
offer
you
that
you
could
eat
but
i
am
afraid
you
would
never
be
able
to
bear
such
coarse
brown
bread
as
we
poor
folks
are
obliged
to
eat
indeed
said
tommy
my
good
mother
i
have
fasted
so
long
and
i
am
so
hungry
that
i
think
i
could
eat
anything
well
then
answered
the
woman
here
is
a
little
bit
of
gammon
of
bacon
which
i
will
broil
for
you
upon
the
embers
and
if
you
can
make
a
supper
you
are
heartily
welcome
while
the
good
woman
was
thus
preparing
supper
the
man
had
closed
his
book
and
placed
it
with
great
respect
upon
a
shelf
which
gave
tommy
the
curiosity
to
ask
him
what
he
was
reading
about
master
answered
the
man
i
was
reading
the
book
which
teaches
me
my
duty
towards
man
and
my
obligations
to
god
i
was
reading
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
and
teaching
it
to
my
children
indeed
i
have
heard
of
that
good
book
mr
barlow
has
often
read
part
of
it
to
me
and
promised
i
should
read
it
myself
that
is
the
book
they
read
at
church
i
have
often
heard
mr
barlow
read
it
to
the
people
and
he
always
reads
it
so
well
and
so
affectingly
that
everybody
listens
and
you
may
hear
even
a
pin
drop
upon
the
pavement
yes
master
mr
barlow
is
a
worthy
servant
and
follower
of
jesus
christ
himself
he
is
the
friend
of
all
the
poor
in
the
neighbourhood
he
gives
us
food
and
medicines
when
we
are
ill
and
he
employs
us
when
we
can
find
no
work
but
what
we
are
even
more
obliged
to
him
for
than
the
giving
us
food
and
raiment
and
life
itself
he
instructs
us
in
our
duty
makes
us
ashamed
of
our
faults
and
teaches
us
how
we
may
be
happy
not
only
here
but
in
another
world
i
was
once
an
idle
abandoned
man
myself
given
up
to
swearing
and
drinking
neglecting
my
family
and
taking
no
thought
for
my
poor
wife
and
children
but
since
mr
barlow
has
taught
me
better
things
and
made
me
acquainted
with
this
blessed
book
my
life
and
manners
i
hope
are
much
amended
and
i
do
my
duty
better
to
my
poor
family
that
indeed
you
do
robin
answered
the
woman
there
is
not
now
a
better
and
kinder
husband
in
the
world
you
have
not
wasted
an
idle
penny
or
a
moment
time
these
two
years
and
without
that
unfortunate
fever
which
prevented
you
from
working
last
harvest
we
should
have
the
greatest
reason
to
be
contented
have
we
not
the
greatest
reason
now
answered
the
man
to
be
not
only
contented
but
thankful
for
all
the
blessings
we
enjoy
it
is
true
that
i
and
several
of
the
children
were
ill
this
year
for
many
weeks
but
did
we
not
all
escape
through
the
blessing
of
god
and
the
care
of
good
mr
barlow
and
this
worthy
master
sandford
who
brought
us
victuals
so
many
days
with
his
own
hands
when
we
otherwise
should
perhaps
have
starved
have
i
not
had
very
good
employment
ever
since
and
do
i
not
now
earn
six
shillings
which
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
when
many
poor
wretches
as
good
as
i
are
starving
because
they
can
not
find
employment
six
shillings
six
shillings
answered
tommy
in
amazement
and
is
that
all
you
and
your
wife
and
children
have
to
live
on
for
a
whole
week
not
all
master
my
wife
sometimes
earns
a
shilling
or
eighteenpence
by
spinning
and
our
eldest
daughter
begins
to
do
something
that
way
but
not
much
that
makes
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
why
i
have
known
my
mother
give
more
than
that
to
go
to
a
place
where
outlandish
people
sing
i
have
seen
her
and
other
ladies
give
a
man
a
guinea
for
dressing
their
hair
and
i
know
a
little
miss
whose
father
gives
a
time
to
a
little
frenchman
who
teaches
her
to
jump
and
caper
about
the
room
master
replied
the
man
smiling
these
are
great
gentlefolks
that
you
are
talking
about
they
are
very
rich
and
have
a
right
to
do
what
they
please
with
their
own
it
is
the
duty
of
us
poor
folks
to
labour
hard
take
what
we
can
get
and
thank
the
great
and
wise
god
that
our
condition
is
no
worse
what
and
is
it
possible
that
you
can
thank
god
for
living
in
such
a
house
as
this
and
earning
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
to
be
sure
i
can
master
is
it
not
an
act
of
his
goodness
that
we
have
clothes
and
a
warm
house
to
shelter
us
and
wholesome
food
to
eat
it
was
but
yesterday
that
two
poor
men
came
by
who
had
been
cast
away
in
a
storm
and
lost
their
ship
and
all
they
had
one
of
the
poor
men
had
scarcely
any
clothes
to
cover
him
and
was
shaking
all
over
with
a
violent
ague
and
the
other
had
his
toes
almost
mortified
by
walking
in
the
snow
am
i
not
a
great
deal
better
off
than
these
poor
men
and
perhaps
than
a
thousand
others
who
are
at
this
time
tossed
about
upon
the
waves
or
cast
away
or
wandering
about
the
world
without
a
shed
to
cover
them
from
the
weather
or
imprisoned
for
debt
might
i
not
have
gone
on
in
committing
bad
actions
like
many
other
unhappy
men
till
i
had
been
guilty
of
some
notorious
crime
which
might
have
brought
me
to
a
shameful
end
and
ought
not
i
to
be
grateful
for
all
these
blessings
which
i
possess
without
deserving
them
tommy
who
had
hitherto
enjoyed
all
the
good
things
of
this
life
without
reflecting
from
whom
he
had
received
them
was
very
much
struck
with
the
piety
of
this
honest
and
contented
man
but
as
he
was
going
to
answer
the
good
woman
who
had
laid
a
clean
though
coarse
cloth
upon
the
table
and
taken
up
her
savoury
supper
in
an
earthen
plate
invited
them
to
sit
down
an
invitation
which
both
the
boys
obeyed
with
the
greatest
pleasure
as
they
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
in
the
meantime
the
honest
man
of
the
house
had
taken
his
hat
and
walked
to
mr
barlow
to
inform
him
that
his
two
pupils
were
safe
in
the
neighbourhood
mr
barlow
had
long
suffered
the
greatest
uneasiness
at
their
absence
and
not
contented
with
sending
after
them
on
every
side
was
at
that
very
time
busy
in
the
pursuit
so
that
the
man
met
him
about
from
his
own
house
as
soon
as
mr
barlow
heard
the
good
news
he
determined
to
return
with
the
man
and
reached
his
house
just
as
tommy
merton
had
finished
one
of
the
heartiest
meals
he
had
ever
made
the
little
boys
rose
up
to
meet
mr
barlow
and
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
look
after
them
expressing
their
concern
for
the
accident
which
had
happened
and
the
uneasiness
which
without
designing
it
they
had
occasioned
but
he
with
the
greatest
advised
them
to
be
more
cautious
for
the
future
and
not
to
extend
their
walks
so
far
then
thanking
the
worthy
people
of
the
house
he
offered
to
conduct
them
and
they
all
three
set
out
together
in
a
very
cold
but
fine
and
evening
as
they
went
home
mr
barlow
renewed
his
caution
and
told
them
the
dangers
they
had
incurred
many
people
said
he
in
your
situation
have
been
surprised
by
an
unexpected
storm
and
losing
their
way
have
perished
with
cold
sometimes
both
men
and
beasts
not
being
able
to
discern
their
accustomed
track
have
fallen
into
deep
pits
filled
up
and
covered
with
the
snow
where
they
have
been
found
buried
several
feet
deep
and
frozen
to
death
and
is
it
impossible
said
tommy
in
such
a
case
to
escape
in
general
it
is
said
mr
barlow
but
there
have
been
some
extraordinary
instances
of
persons
who
have
lived
several
days
in
that
condition
and
yet
have
been
taken
out
alive
you
shall
read
a
remarkable
story
to
that
purpose
as
they
were
walking
on
tommy
looked
up
at
the
sky
where
all
the
stars
glimmered
with
unusual
brightness
and
said
what
an
innumerable
number
of
stars
is
here
i
think
i
never
observed
so
many
before
in
all
my
life
innumerable
as
they
appear
to
you
said
mr
barlow
there
are
persons
that
have
not
only
counted
all
you
now
see
but
thousands
more
which
are
at
present
invisible
to
your
eye
how
can
that
be
inquired
tommy
for
there
is
neither
beginning
nor
end
they
are
scattered
so
confusedly
about
the
sky
that
i
should
think
it
as
impossible
to
number
them
as
the
flakes
of
snow
that
fell
while
we
were
in
the
wood
at
this
mr
barlow
smiled
and
said
that
he
believed
harry
could
give
him
a
different
account
although
perhaps
he
could
not
number
them
all
harry
said
he
can
not
you
show
your
companion
some
of
the
constellations
yes
answered
harry
i
believe
i
remember
some
that
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
teach
me
but
pray
sir
said
tommy
what
is
a
constellation
those
answered
mr
barlow
who
first
began
to
observe
the
heavens
as
you
do
now
have
observed
certain
stars
remarkable
either
for
their
brightness
or
position
to
these
they
have
given
a
particular
name
that
they
might
the
more
easily
know
them
again
and
discourse
of
them
to
others
and
these
particular
clusters
of
stars
thus
joined
together
and
named
they
call
but
come
harry
you
are
a
little
farmer
and
can
certainly
point
out
to
us
charles
wain
harry
then
looked
up
to
the
sky
and
pointed
out
seven
very
bright
stars
towards
the
north
you
are
right
said
mr
barlow
four
of
these
stars
have
put
the
common
people
in
mind
of
the
four
wheels
of
a
waggon
and
the
three
others
of
the
horses
therefore
they
have
called
them
by
this
name
now
tommy
look
well
at
these
and
see
if
you
can
find
any
seven
stars
in
the
whole
sky
that
resemble
them
in
their
position
indeed
sir
i
do
not
think
i
can
do
you
not
think
then
that
you
can
find
them
again
i
will
try
sir
now
i
will
take
my
eye
off
and
look
another
way
i
protest
i
can
not
find
them
again
oh
i
believe
there
they
are
pray
sir
pointing
with
his
finger
is
not
that
charles
wain
you
are
right
and
by
remembering
these
stars
you
may
very
easily
observe
those
which
are
next
to
them
and
learn
their
names
too
till
you
are
acquainted
with
the
whole
face
of
the
heavens
that
is
indeed
very
clever
and
very
surprising
i
will
show
my
mother
charles
wain
the
first
time
i
go
home
i
daresay
she
has
never
observed
it
but
look
on
the
two
stars
which
compose
the
hinder
wheel
of
the
waggon
and
raise
your
eye
up
towards
the
top
of
the
sky
do
you
not
see
a
very
bright
star
that
seems
to
be
almost
but
not
quite
in
a
line
with
the
two
others
yes
sir
i
see
it
plainly
that
is
called
the
it
never
moves
from
its
place
and
by
looking
full
at
it
you
may
always
find
the
north
then
if
i
turn
my
face
towards
that
star
i
always
look
to
the
north
you
are
right
then
i
shall
turn
my
back
to
the
south
you
are
right
again
and
now
can
not
you
find
the
east
and
the
west
is
it
not
the
east
where
the
sun
rises
yes
but
there
is
no
sun
to
direct
you
now
then
sir
i
can
not
find
it
out
do
not
you
know
harry
i
believe
sir
that
if
you
turn
your
face
to
the
north
the
east
will
be
on
the
right
hand
and
the
west
on
the
left
perfectly
right
that
is
very
clever
indeed
so
then
by
knowing
the
i
can
always
find
north
east
west
and
south
but
you
said
that
the
never
moves
do
the
other
stars
then
move
out
of
their
places
that
is
a
question
you
may
learn
to
answer
yourself
by
observing
the
present
appearance
of
the
heavens
and
then
examining
whether
the
stars
change
their
places
at
any
future
time
but
sir
i
have
thought
that
it
would
be
a
good
contrivance
in
order
to
remember
their
situation
if
i
were
to
draw
them
upon
a
bit
of
paper
but
how
would
you
do
that
i
would
make
a
mark
upon
the
paper
for
every
star
in
wain
and
i
would
place
the
marks
just
as
i
see
the
stars
placed
in
the
sky
and
i
would
entreat
you
to
write
the
names
for
me
and
this
i
would
do
till
i
was
acquainted
with
all
the
stars
in
the
heavens
that
would
be
an
excellent
way
but
you
see
a
paper
is
flat
is
that
the
form
of
the
sky
no
the
sky
seems
to
rise
from
the
earth
on
every
side
like
the
dome
of
a
great
church
then
if
you
were
to
have
some
round
body
i
should
think
it
would
correspond
to
the
different
parts
of
the
sky
and
you
might
place
your
stars
with
more
exactness
that
is
true
indeed
sir
i
wish
i
had
just
such
a
globe
well
just
such
a
globe
i
will
endeavour
to
procure
you
sir
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
but
of
what
use
is
it
to
know
the
stars
were
there
no
other
use
i
should
think
there
would
be
a
very
great
pleasure
in
observing
such
a
number
of
glorious
glittering
bodies
as
are
now
above
us
we
sometimes
run
to
see
a
procession
of
coaches
or
a
few
people
in
fine
clothes
strutting
about
we
admire
a
large
room
that
is
painted
and
ornamented
and
gilded
but
what
is
there
in
all
these
things
to
be
compared
with
the
sight
of
these
luminous
bodies
that
adorn
every
part
of
the
sky
that
true
indeed
my
lord
wimple
great
room
that
i
have
heard
all
the
people
admire
so
much
is
no
more
to
be
compared
to
it
than
the
shabbiest
thing
in
the
world
that
is
indeed
true
but
there
are
some
and
those
very
important
uses
to
be
derived
from
an
acquaintance
with
the
stars
harry
do
you
tell
master
merton
the
story
of
your
being
lost
upon
the
great
moor
you
must
know
master
tommy
that
i
have
an
uncle
who
lives
about
three
miles
off
across
the
great
moor
that
we
have
sometimes
walked
upon
now
my
father
as
i
am
in
general
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
roads
very
often
sends
me
with
messages
to
my
uncle
one
evening
i
went
there
so
late
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
get
home
again
before
it
was
quite
dark
it
was
at
that
time
in
the
month
of
october
my
uncle
wished
me
very
much
to
stay
at
his
house
all
night
but
that
was
not
proper
for
me
to
do
because
my
father
had
ordered
me
to
come
back
so
i
set
out
as
soon
as
i
possibly
could
but
just
as
i
had
reached
the
heath
the
evening
grew
extremely
dark
and
were
not
you
frightened
to
find
yourself
all
alone
upon
such
a
dismal
place
no
i
knew
the
worst
that
could
happen
would
be
that
i
should
stay
there
all
night
and
as
soon
as
ever
the
morning
shone
i
should
have
found
my
way
home
but
however
by
the
time
that
i
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
heath
there
came
on
such
a
violent
tempest
of
wind
blowing
full
in
my
face
accompanied
with
such
a
shower
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
continue
my
way
so
i
quitted
the
track
which
is
never
very
easy
to
find
and
ran
aside
to
a
that
was
growing
at
some
distance
in
order
to
seek
a
little
shelter
here
i
lay
very
conveniently
till
the
storm
was
almost
over
then
i
rose
and
attempted
to
continue
my
way
but
unfortunately
i
missed
the
track
and
lost
myself
that
was
a
very
dismal
thing
indeed
i
wandered
about
a
great
while
but
still
to
no
purpose
i
had
not
a
single
mark
to
direct
me
because
the
common
is
so
extensive
and
so
bare
either
of
trees
or
houses
that
one
may
walk
for
miles
and
see
nothing
but
heath
and
furze
sometimes
i
tore
my
legs
in
scrambling
through
great
thickets
of
furze
now
and
then
i
plumped
into
a
hole
full
of
water
and
should
have
been
drowned
if
i
had
not
learned
to
swim
so
that
at
last
i
was
going
to
give
it
up
in
despair
when
looking
on
one
side
i
saw
a
light
at
a
little
distance
which
seemed
to
be
a
candle
and
lantern
that
somebody
was
carrying
across
the
moor
did
not
that
give
you
very
great
comfort
you
shall
hear
answered
harry
smiling
at
first
i
was
doubtful
whether
i
should
go
up
to
it
but
i
considered
that
it
was
not
worth
anybody
pains
to
hurt
a
poor
boy
like
me
and
that
no
person
who
was
out
on
any
ill
design
would
probably
choose
to
carry
a
light
so
i
determined
boldly
to
go
up
to
it
and
inquire
the
way
and
did
the
person
with
the
candle
and
lantern
direct
you
i
began
walking
up
towards
it
when
immediately
the
light
which
i
had
first
observed
on
my
right
hand
moving
slowly
along
by
my
side
changed
its
direction
and
went
directly
before
me
with
about
the
same
degree
of
swiftness
i
thought
this
very
odd
but
i
still
continued
the
chase
and
just
as
i
thought
i
had
approached
very
near
i
tumbled
into
another
pit
full
of
water
that
was
unlucky
indeed
well
i
scrambled
out
and
very
luckily
on
the
same
side
with
the
light
which
i
began
to
follow
again
but
with
as
little
success
as
ever
i
had
now
wandered
many
miles
about
the
common
i
knew
no
more
where
i
was
than
if
i
had
been
set
down
upon
an
unknown
country
i
had
no
hopes
of
finding
my
way
home
unless
i
could
reach
this
wandering
light
and
though
i
could
not
conceive
that
the
person
who
carried
it
could
know
of
my
being
so
near
he
seemed
to
act
as
if
he
was
determined
to
avoid
me
however
i
was
resolved
to
make
one
attempt
and
therefore
i
began
to
run
as
fast
as
i
was
able
hallooing
out
at
the
same
time
to
the
person
that
i
thought
before
me
to
entreat
him
to
stop
and
did
he
instead
of
that
the
light
which
had
before
been
moving
along
at
a
slow
and
easy
pace
now
began
to
dance
as
it
were
before
me
ten
times
faster
than
before
so
that
instead
of
overtaking
it
i
found
myself
farther
and
farther
behind
still
however
i
ran
on
till
i
unwarily
sunk
up
to
the
middle
in
a
large
bog
out
of
which
i
at
last
scrambled
with
a
very
great
difficulty
surprised
at
this
and
not
conceiving
that
any
human
being
could
pass
over
such
a
bog
as
this
i
determined
to
pursue
it
no
longer
but
now
i
was
wet
and
weary
the
clouds
had
indeed
rolled
away
and
the
moon
and
stars
began
to
shine
i
looked
around
me
and
could
discern
nothing
but
a
wide
barren
country
without
so
much
as
a
tree
to
shelter
me
or
any
animal
in
sight
i
listened
in
hopes
of
hearing
a
sheepbell
or
the
barking
of
a
dog
but
nothing
met
my
ear
except
the
shrill
whistling
of
the
wind
which
blew
so
cold
that
it
chilled
me
to
the
very
heart
in
this
situation
i
stopped
a
while
to
consider
what
i
should
do
and
raising
my
eyes
by
accident
to
the
sky
the
first
object
i
beheld
was
that
very
constellation
of
charles
wain
and
above
it
i
discerned
the
glimmering
as
it
were
from
the
very
top
of
heaven
instantly
a
thought
came
into
my
mind
i
considered
that
when
i
had
been
walking
along
the
road
which
led
towards
my
uncle
house
i
had
often
observed
the
full
before
me
therefore
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
turned
my
back
exactly
upon
it
and
went
straight
forward
in
a
contrary
direction
it
must
lead
me
towards
my
father
house
as
soon
as
i
had
formed
this
resolution
i
began
to
execute
it
i
was
persuaded
i
should
now
escape
and
therefore
forgetting
my
fatigue
i
ran
along
as
briskly
as
if
i
had
but
then
set
out
nor
was
i
disappointed
for
though
i
could
see
no
tracks
yet
taking
the
greatest
care
always
to
go
on
in
that
direction
the
moon
afforded
me
light
enough
to
avoid
the
pits
and
bogs
which
are
found
in
various
parts
of
that
wild
moor
and
when
i
had
travelled
as
i
imagined
about
three
miles
i
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
which
gave
me
double
vigour
and
going
a
little
farther
i
came
to
some
enclosures
at
the
skirts
of
the
common
which
i
knew
so
that
i
then
with
ease
found
my
way
home
after
having
almost
despaired
of
doing
it
indeed
then
the
knowledge
of
the
was
of
very
great
use
to
you
i
am
determined
i
will
make
myself
acquainted
with
all
the
stars
in
the
heavens
but
did
you
ever
find
out
what
that
light
was
which
danced
before
you
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
when
i
came
home
my
father
told
me
it
was
what
the
common
people
called
a
and
mr
barlow
has
since
informed
me
that
these
things
are
only
vapours
which
rise
out
of
the
earth
in
moist
and
fenny
places
although
they
have
that
bright
appearance
and
therefore
told
me
that
many
people
like
me
who
have
taken
them
for
a
lighted
candle
have
followed
them
as
i
did
into
bogs
and
ditches
just
as
harry
had
finished
his
story
they
arrived
at
mr
barlow
and
after
sitting
some
time
and
talking
over
the
accidents
of
the
day
the
little
boys
retired
to
bed
mr
barlow
was
sitting
alone
and
reading
in
his
parlour
when
to
his
great
surprise
tommy
came
running
into
the
room
half
undressed
and
bawling
out
sir
sir
i
have
found
it
out
they
move
they
move
what
moves
said
mr
barlow
why
charles
wain
moves
answered
tommy
i
had
a
mind
to
take
one
peep
at
the
sky
before
i
went
to
bed
and
i
see
that
all
the
seven
stars
have
moved
from
their
places
a
great
way
higher
up
the
sky
well
said
mr
barlow
you
are
indeed
right
you
have
done
a
vast
deal
and
we
will
talk
over
these
things
again
when
the
morrow
came
tommy
put
mr
barlow
in
mind
of
the
story
he
had
promised
him
about
the
people
buried
in
the
snow
mr
barlow
looked
him
out
the
book
but
first
said
it
is
necessary
to
give
you
some
explanation
the
country
where
this
accident
happened
is
a
country
full
of
rocks
and
mountains
so
excessively
high
that
the
snow
never
melts
upon
their
tops
never
said
tommy
not
even
in
the
summer
not
even
in
the
summer
the
valleys
between
these
mountains
are
inhabited
by
a
brave
and
industrious
people
the
sides
of
them
too
are
cultivated
but
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
are
so
extremely
cold
that
the
ice
and
snow
never
melt
but
go
on
continually
increasing
during
a
great
part
of
the
winter
the
weather
is
extremely
cold
and
the
inhabitants
confine
themselves
within
their
houses
which
they
have
the
art
to
render
very
comfortable
almost
all
the
roads
are
then
impassable
and
snow
and
ice
afford
the
only
prospect
but
when
the
year
begins
to
grow
warmer
the
snow
is
frequently
thawed
upon
the
sides
of
the
mountains
and
undermined
by
the
torrents
of
water
which
pour
down
with
irresistible
fury
hence
it
frequently
happens
that
such
prodigious
masses
of
snow
fall
down
as
are
sufficient
to
bury
beasts
and
houses
and
even
villages
themselves
beneath
them
it
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
prodigious
mountains
which
are
called
the
that
on
the
of
march
a
small
cluster
of
houses
was
entirely
overwhelmed
by
two
vast
bodies
of
snow
that
tumbled
down
upon
them
from
a
greater
height
all
the
inhabitants
were
then
within
doors
except
one
joseph
rochia
and
his
son
a
lad
of
fifteen
who
were
on
the
roof
of
their
house
clearing
away
the
snow
which
had
fallen
for
three
days
incessantly
a
priest
going
by
to
church
advised
them
to
come
down
having
just
before
observed
a
body
of
snow
tumbling
from
the
mountain
towards
them
the
man
descended
with
great
precipitation
and
fled
with
his
son
he
knew
not
whither
but
scarcely
had
he
gone
thirty
or
forty
steps
before
his
son
who
followed
him
fell
down
on
which
looking
back
he
saw
his
own
and
his
neighbours
houses
in
which
were
persons
in
all
covered
with
a
high
mountain
of
snow
he
lifted
up
his
son
and
reflecting
that
his
wife
his
sister
two
children
and
all
his
effects
were
thus
buried
he
fainted
away
but
soon
reviving
got
safe
to
a
friend
house
at
some
distance
five
days
after
joseph
being
perfectly
recovered
got
upon
the
snow
with
his
son
and
two
of
his
wife
brothers
to
try
if
he
could
find
the
exact
place
where
his
house
stood
but
after
many
openings
made
in
the
snow
they
could
not
discover
it
the
month
of
april
proving
hot
and
the
snow
beginning
to
soften
he
again
used
his
utmost
endeavours
to
recover
his
effects
and
to
bury
as
he
thought
the
remains
of
his
family
he
made
new
openings
and
threw
in
earth
to
melt
the
snow
which
on
the
of
april
was
greatly
diminished
he
broke
through
ice
six
english
feet
thick
with
iron
bars
thrust
down
a
long
pole
and
touched
the
ground
but
evening
coming
on
he
desisted
the
next
day
the
brother
of
his
wife
who
had
heard
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
family
came
to
the
house
where
joseph
was
and
after
resting
himself
a
little
went
with
him
to
work
upon
the
snow
where
they
made
another
opening
which
led
them
to
the
house
they
searched
for
but
finding
no
dead
bodies
in
its
ruins
they
sought
for
the
stable
which
was
about
two
hundred
and
forty
english
feet
distant
which
having
found
they
heard
the
cry
of
my
dear
brother
being
greatly
surprised
as
well
as
encouraged
by
these
words
they
laboured
with
all
diligence
till
they
had
made
a
large
opening
through
which
the
brother
immediately
went
down
where
the
sister
with
an
agonising
and
feeble
voice
told
him
have
always
trusted
in
god
and
you
that
you
would
not
forsake
me
the
other
brother
and
the
husband
then
went
down
and
found
still
alive
the
wife
about
the
sister
about
and
the
daughter
about
thirteen
years
old
these
they
raised
on
their
shoulders
to
men
above
who
pulled
them
up
as
if
from
the
grave
and
carried
them
to
a
neighbouring
house
they
were
unable
to
walk
and
so
wasted
that
they
appeared
like
mere
skeletons
they
were
immediately
put
to
bed
and
gruel
of
and
a
little
butter
was
given
to
recover
them
some
days
after
the
magistrate
of
the
place
came
to
visit
them
and
found
the
wife
still
unable
to
rise
from
bed
or
use
her
feet
from
the
intense
cold
she
had
endured
and
the
uneasy
posture
she
had
been
in
the
sister
whose
legs
had
been
bathed
with
hot
wine
could
walk
with
some
difficulty
and
the
daughter
needed
no
further
remedies
on
the
magistrate
interrogating
the
women
they
told
him
that
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
they
were
in
the
stable
with
a
boy
of
six
years
old
and
a
girl
of
about
thirteen
in
the
same
stable
were
six
goats
one
of
which
having
brought
forth
two
dead
kids
the
night
before
they
went
to
carry
her
a
small
vessel
of
gruel
there
were
also
an
ass
and
five
or
six
fowls
they
were
sheltering
themselves
in
a
warm
corner
of
the
stable
till
the
should
ring
intending
to
attend
the
service
the
wife
related
that
wanting
to
go
out
of
the
stable
to
kindle
a
fire
in
the
house
of
her
husband
who
was
clearing
away
the
snow
from
the
top
of
it
she
perceived
a
mass
of
snow
breaking
down
towards
the
east
upon
which
she
went
back
into
the
stable
shut
the
door
and
told
her
sister
of
it
in
less
than
three
minutes
they
heard
the
roof
break
over
their
heads
and
also
a
part
of
the
ceiling
the
sister
advised
to
get
into
the
rack
and
manger
which
they
did
the
ass
was
tied
to
the
manger
but
got
loose
by
kicking
and
struggling
and
threw
down
the
little
vessel
which
they
found
and
afterwards
used
to
hold
the
melted
snow
which
served
them
for
drink
very
fortunately
the
manger
was
under
the
main
prop
of
the
stable
and
so
resisted
the
weight
of
the
snow
their
first
care
was
to
know
what
they
had
to
eat
the
sister
said
she
had
fifteen
chestnuts
in
her
pockets
the
children
said
they
had
breakfasted
and
should
want
no
more
that
day
they
remembered
there
were
or
forty
cakes
in
a
place
near
the
stable
and
endeavoured
to
get
at
them
but
were
not
able
for
the
snow
they
called
often
for
help
but
were
heard
by
none
the
sister
gave
the
chestnuts
to
the
wife
and
ate
two
herself
and
they
drank
some
the
ass
was
restless
and
the
goats
kept
bleating
for
some
days
after
which
they
heard
no
more
of
them
two
of
the
goats
however
being
left
alive
and
near
the
manger
they
felt
them
and
found
that
one
of
them
was
big
and
would
kid
as
they
recollected
about
the
middle
of
april
the
other
gave
milk
wherewith
they
preserved
their
lives
during
all
this
time
they
saw
not
one
ray
of
light
yet
for
about
twenty
days
they
had
some
notice
of
night
and
day
from
the
crowing
of
the
fowls
till
they
died
the
second
day
being
very
hungry
they
ate
all
the
chestnuts
and
drank
what
milk
the
goat
yielded
being
very
near
two
quarts
at
first
but
it
soon
decreased
the
third
day
they
attempted
again
but
in
vain
to
get
at
the
cakes
so
resolved
to
take
all
possible
care
to
feed
the
goats
for
just
above
the
manger
was
a
where
through
a
hole
the
sister
pulled
down
hay
into
the
rack
and
gave
it
to
the
goats
as
long
as
she
could
reach
it
and
then
when
it
was
beyond
her
reach
the
goats
climbed
upon
her
shoulders
and
reached
it
themselves
on
the
sixth
day
the
boy
sickened
and
six
days
after
desired
his
mother
who
all
this
time
had
held
him
in
her
lap
to
lay
him
at
his
length
in
the
manger
she
did
so
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
felt
it
was
very
cold
she
then
put
her
hand
to
his
mouth
and
finding
that
cold
likewise
she
gave
him
a
little
milk
the
boy
then
cried
my
father
is
in
the
snow
oh
father
father
and
then
expired
in
the
meanwhile
the
goat
milk
diminished
daily
and
the
fowls
soon
after
dying
they
could
no
longer
distinguish
night
from
day
but
according
to
their
reckoning
the
time
was
near
when
the
other
goat
would
kid
this
she
accordingly
did
soon
and
the
young
one
dying
they
had
all
the
milk
for
their
own
subsistence
so
they
found
that
the
middle
of
april
was
come
whenever
they
called
this
goat
it
would
come
and
lick
their
faces
and
hands
and
gave
them
every
day
two
quarts
of
milk
on
which
account
they
still
bear
the
poor
creature
a
great
affection
this
was
the
account
which
these
poor
people
gave
to
the
magistrate
of
their
preservation
dear
heart
said
tommy
when
mr
barlow
had
finished
this
account
what
a
number
of
accidents
people
are
subject
to
in
this
world
it
is
very
true
answered
mr
barlow
but
as
that
is
the
case
it
is
necessary
to
improve
ourselves
in
every
manner
that
we
may
be
able
to
struggle
against
them
indeed
sir
i
begin
to
believe
it
is
for
when
i
was
less
than
i
am
now
i
remember
i
was
always
fretful
and
hurting
myself
though
i
had
two
or
three
people
constantly
to
take
care
of
me
at
present
i
seem
as
if
i
was
quite
another
thing
i
do
not
mind
falling
down
and
hurting
myself
or
cold
or
weariness
or
scarcely
anything
which
happens
and
which
do
you
prefer
to
be
as
you
are
now
or
as
you
were
before
as
i
am
now
a
great
deal
sir
for
then
i
always
had
something
or
another
the
matter
with
me
sometimes
i
had
a
little
cold
and
then
i
was
obliged
to
stay
in
for
several
days
sometimes
a
little
headache
and
then
i
was
forced
to
take
physic
sometimes
the
weather
was
too
hot
then
i
must
stay
within
and
the
same
if
it
was
too
cold
i
used
to
be
tired
to
death
if
i
did
but
walk
a
mile
and
i
was
always
eating
cake
and
sweetmeats
till
i
made
myself
sick
at
present
i
think
i
am
ten
times
stronger
and
healthier
than
ever
i
was
in
my
life
but
what
a
terrible
country
that
must
be
where
people
are
subject
to
be
buried
in
that
manner
in
the
snow
i
wonder
anybody
will
live
there
the
people
who
inhabit
that
country
are
of
a
different
opinion
and
prefer
it
to
all
the
countries
in
the
world
they
are
great
travellers
and
many
of
them
follow
different
professions
in
all
the
different
countries
of
europe
but
it
is
the
only
wish
of
almost
all
to
return
before
their
death
to
the
mountains
where
they
were
born
and
have
passed
their
youth
i
do
not
easily
understand
that
i
have
seen
a
great
many
ladies
and
little
misses
at
our
house
and
whenever
they
were
talking
of
the
places
where
they
should
like
to
live
i
have
always
heard
them
say
that
they
hated
the
country
of
all
things
though
they
were
born
and
bred
there
i
have
heard
one
say
the
country
is
odious
filthy
shocking
and
abominable
another
that
it
is
impossible
to
live
anywhere
but
in
london
and
i
remember
once
seeing
a
strange
lady
who
wrote
down
her
observations
in
a
book
and
she
said
the
country
was
all
full
of
barbarians
and
that
no
person
of
elegance
yes
that
was
her
word
could
bear
it
for
a
week
and
yet
there
are
thousands
who
bear
to
live
in
it
all
their
lives
and
have
no
desire
to
change
should
you
harry
like
to
leave
the
country
and
go
to
live
in
some
town
indeed
sir
i
should
not
for
then
i
must
leave
everything
i
love
in
the
world
i
must
leave
my
father
and
mother
who
have
been
so
kind
to
me
and
you
too
sir
who
have
taken
such
pains
to
improve
me
and
make
me
good
i
am
convinced
that
i
never
shall
find
such
friends
again
as
long
as
i
live
and
what
should
anybody
wish
to
live
for
who
has
no
friends
besides
there
is
not
a
field
upon
my
father
farm
that
i
do
not
prefer
to
every
town
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
have
you
ever
been
in
any
large
town
once
i
was
in
exeter
but
i
did
not
much
like
it
the
houses
seemed
to
me
to
stand
so
thick
and
close
that
i
think
our
would
be
almost
as
agreeable
places
to
live
in
and
then
there
are
little
narrow
alleys
where
the
poor
live
and
the
houses
are
so
high
that
neither
light
nor
air
can
ever
get
to
them
and
the
most
of
them
appeared
so
dirty
and
unhealthy
that
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
look
at
them
and
then
i
walked
along
the
streets
and
peeped
into
the
shops
and
what
do
you
think
i
saw
what
why
i
saw
great
hulking
fellows
as
big
as
our
ploughmen
and
carters
with
their
heads
all
frizzled
and
curled
like
one
of
our
sheep
tails
that
did
nothing
but
finger
ribbons
and
caps
for
the
women
this
diverted
me
so
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
ready
to
split
my
sides
and
then
the
gentlewoman
at
whose
house
i
was
took
me
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
large
room
full
of
candles
and
a
greater
number
of
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
all
dressed
out
and
showy
who
were
dancing
about
as
if
they
were
mad
but
at
the
door
of
this
house
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
ragged
women
and
children
who
stood
shivering
in
the
rain
and
begged
for
a
bit
of
bread
but
nobody
gave
it
to
them
or
took
any
notice
of
them
so
then
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
all
the
fine
people
would
give
some
of
their
money
to
the
poor
that
they
might
have
some
clothes
and
victuals
in
their
turn
that
is
indeed
true
had
i
been
there
i
should
have
relieved
the
poor
people
for
you
know
i
am
very
and
generous
but
it
is
necessary
for
gentlemen
to
be
fine
and
to
dress
well
it
may
be
so
but
i
never
saw
any
great
good
come
of
it
for
my
part
as
i
was
walking
along
the
streets
one
day
and
staring
about
i
met
two
very
fine
and
dressy
young
gentlemen
who
looked
something
as
you
did
master
tommy
when
you
first
came
here
so
i
turned
off
from
the
to
let
them
pass
for
my
father
always
taught
me
to
show
civility
to
people
in
a
higher
station
but
that
was
not
enough
it
seems
for
just
as
they
passed
by
me
they
gave
me
such
a
violent
push
that
down
i
came
into
the
kennel
and
dirtied
myself
all
over
from
head
to
foot
and
did
they
not
beg
your
pardon
for
the
accident
accident
it
was
no
accident
at
all
for
they
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
called
me
a
little
clodpole
upon
which
i
told
them
if
i
was
a
clodpole
they
had
no
business
to
insult
me
and
then
they
came
back
and
one
of
them
gave
me
a
kick
and
the
other
a
slap
on
the
face
but
i
told
them
that
was
too
much
for
me
to
bear
so
i
struck
them
again
and
we
all
three
began
fighting
what
both
at
once
that
was
a
cowardly
trick
i
did
not
much
mind
that
but
there
came
up
a
fine
smart
fellow
in
white
stockings
and
powdered
hair
who
it
seems
was
their
servant
and
he
was
going
to
fall
upon
me
too
but
a
man
took
my
part
and
said
i
should
have
fair
play
so
i
fought
them
both
till
they
did
not
choose
to
have
any
more
for
though
they
were
so
quarrelsome
they
could
not
fight
worth
a
farthing
so
i
let
them
go
and
advised
them
not
to
meddle
any
more
with
poor
boys
who
did
nothing
to
offend
them
and
did
you
hear
no
more
of
these
young
gentlemen
no
for
i
went
home
the
next
day
and
never
was
i
better
pleased
in
my
life
when
i
came
to
the
top
of
the
great
hill
from
which
you
have
a
prospect
of
our
house
i
really
thought
i
should
have
cried
with
joy
the
fields
looked
all
so
pleasant
and
the
cattle
that
were
feeding
in
them
so
happy
then
every
step
i
took
i
met
with
somebody
or
other
i
knew
or
some
little
boy
that
i
used
to
play
with
here
is
little
harry
come
back
said
one
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
cried
a
second
then
a
third
shook
hands
with
me
and
the
very
cattle
when
i
went
to
see
them
seemed
all
glad
that
i
was
come
home
again
you
see
by
this
that
it
is
very
possible
for
people
to
like
the
country
and
be
happy
in
it
but
as
to
the
fine
young
ladies
you
talk
of
the
truth
is
that
they
neither
love
nor
would
be
long
contented
in
any
place
their
whole
happiness
consists
in
idleness
and
finery
they
have
neither
learned
to
employ
themselves
in
anything
useful
nor
to
improve
their
minds
as
to
every
kind
of
natural
exercise
they
are
brought
up
with
too
much
delicacy
to
be
able
to
bear
it
and
from
the
improper
indulgences
they
meet
with
they
learn
to
tremble
at
every
trifling
change
of
the
seasons
with
such
dispositions
it
is
no
wonder
they
dislike
the
where
they
find
neither
employment
nor
amusement
they
wish
to
go
to
because
there
they
meet
with
infinite
numbers
as
idle
and
frivolous
as
themselves
and
these
people
mutually
assist
each
other
to
talk
about
trifles
and
waste
their
time
that
is
true
sir
really
for
when
we
have
a
great
deal
of
company
i
have
often
observed
that
they
never
talked
about
anything
but
eating
or
dressing
or
men
and
women
that
are
paid
to
make
faces
at
the
playhouse
or
a
great
room
called
where
everybody
goes
to
meet
his
friends
i
believe
harry
will
never
go
there
to
meet
his
friends
indeed
sir
i
do
not
know
what
ranelagh
is
but
all
the
friends
i
have
are
at
home
and
when
i
sit
by
the
fireside
on
a
night
and
read
to
my
father
and
mother
and
sister
as
i
sometimes
do
or
when
i
talk
with
you
and
master
tommy
upon
improving
subjects
i
never
desire
any
other
friends
or
conversation
but
pray
sir
what
is
ranelagh
ranelagh
is
a
very
large
round
room
to
which
at
particular
times
of
the
year
great
numbers
of
persons
go
in
their
carriages
to
walk
about
for
several
hours
and
does
nobody
go
there
that
has
not
several
friends
because
master
tommy
said
that
people
went
to
ranelagh
to
meet
their
friends
mr
barlow
smiled
at
this
question
and
answered
the
room
is
generally
so
crowded
that
people
have
little
opportunity
for
any
kind
of
conversation
they
walk
round
the
room
in
a
circle
one
after
the
other
just
like
horses
in
a
mill
when
persons
meet
that
know
each
other
they
perhaps
smile
and
bow
but
are
shoved
forward
without
having
any
opportunity
to
stop
as
to
few
people
go
to
look
for
them
there
and
if
they
were
to
meet
them
few
would
take
the
trouble
of
speaking
to
them
unless
they
were
dressed
in
a
fashionable
manner
and
seemed
to
be
of
that
is
very
extraordinary
indeed
why
sir
what
can
a
dress
have
to
do
with
friendship
should
i
love
you
a
bit
better
if
you
were
to
wear
the
finest
clothes
in
the
world
or
should
i
like
my
father
the
better
if
he
were
to
put
on
a
laced
coat
like
squire
chase
on
the
contrary
whenever
i
see
people
dressed
very
fine
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
story
you
once
read
me
of
agesilaus
king
of
sparta
what
is
that
story
do
let
me
hear
it
you
shall
hear
it
at
present
we
have
read
and
conversed
enough
it
is
better
that
you
should
go
out
and
amuse
yourselves
the
little
boys
then
went
out
and
returned
to
a
diversion
they
had
been
amusing
themselves
with
for
several
days
the
making
a
prodigious
snowball
they
had
begun
by
making
a
small
globe
of
snow
with
their
hands
which
they
turned
over
and
over
till
by
continually
collecting
fresh
matter
it
grew
so
large
that
they
were
unable
to
roll
it
any
farther
here
tommy
observed
that
their
labours
must
end
for
it
was
impossible
to
turn
it
any
longer
no
said
harry
i
know
a
remedy
for
that
so
he
ran
and
fetched
a
couple
of
thick
sticks
about
five
feet
long
and
giving
one
of
them
to
tommy
he
took
the
other
himself
he
then
desired
tommy
to
put
the
end
of
his
stick
under
the
mass
while
he
did
the
same
on
his
side
and
then
lifting
at
the
other
end
they
rolled
the
heap
forward
with
the
greatest
ease
tommy
was
extremely
surprised
at
this
and
said
how
can
this
be
we
are
not
a
bit
stronger
than
we
were
before
and
yet
now
we
are
able
to
roll
this
snowball
along
with
ease
which
we
could
not
even
stir
before
that
is
very
true
answered
harry
but
it
is
owing
to
these
sticks
this
is
the
way
that
the
labourers
move
the
largest
trees
which
without
this
contrivance
they
would
not
be
able
to
stir
i
am
very
much
surprised
at
this
said
tommy
i
never
should
have
imagined
that
the
sticks
would
have
given
us
more
strength
than
we
had
before
just
as
he
had
said
this
through
a
violent
effort
both
their
sticks
broke
short
in
the
middle
this
is
no
great
loss
observed
tommy
for
the
ends
will
do
just
as
well
as
the
whole
sticks
they
then
tried
to
shove
the
ball
again
with
the
truncheons
which
remained
in
their
hands
but
to
the
new
surprise
of
tommy
they
found
they
were
unable
to
stir
it
that
is
very
curious
indeed
said
tommy
i
find
that
only
long
sticks
are
of
any
use
that
said
harry
i
could
have
told
you
before
but
i
had
a
mind
you
should
find
it
out
yourself
the
longer
the
stick
is
provided
it
is
sufficiently
strong
and
you
can
manage
it
the
more
easily
will
you
succeed
this
is
really
very
curious
replied
tommy
but
i
see
some
of
mr
labourers
at
work
a
little
way
off
let
us
go
to
them
and
desire
them
to
cut
us
two
longer
sticks
that
we
may
try
their
effect
they
then
went
up
to
the
men
who
were
at
work
but
here
a
new
subject
of
admiration
presented
itself
to
tommy
mind
there
was
a
root
of
a
prodigious
oak
tree
so
large
and
heavy
that
horses
would
scarcely
have
been
able
to
draw
it
along
besides
it
was
so
tough
and
knotty
that
the
sharpest
axe
could
hardly
make
any
impression
upon
it
this
a
couple
of
old
men
were
attempting
to
cleave
in
pieces
in
order
to
make
billets
for
mr
barlow
fire
tommy
who
thought
their
strength
totally
disproportionate
to
such
an
undertaking
could
not
help
pitying
them
and
observing
that
certainly
mr
barlow
did
not
know
what
they
were
about
or
he
would
have
prevented
such
poor
weak
old
men
from
fatiguing
themselves
about
what
they
never
could
perform
do
you
think
so
replied
harry
what
would
you
then
say
if
you
were
to
see
me
little
as
i
am
perform
this
wonderful
task
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
these
good
people
so
he
took
up
a
wooden
mallet
an
instrument
which
although
much
larger
resembles
a
hammer
and
began
beating
the
root
which
he
did
for
some
time
without
making
the
least
impression
tommy
who
imagined
that
for
this
time
his
friend
harry
was
caught
began
to
smile
and
told
him
that
he
would
break
a
hundred
mallets
to
pieces
before
he
made
the
least
impression
upon
the
wood
say
you
so
answered
harry
smiling
then
i
believe
i
must
try
another
method
so
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
a
small
piece
of
rough
iron
about
six
inches
long
which
tommy
had
not
before
observed
as
it
lay
upon
the
ground
this
iron
was
broad
at
the
top
but
gradually
sloped
all
the
way
down
till
it
came
to
a
perfect
edge
at
bottom
harry
then
took
it
up
and
with
a
few
blows
drove
it
a
little
way
into
the
body
of
the
root
the
old
man
and
he
then
struck
alternately
with
their
mallets
upon
the
head
of
the
iron
till
the
root
began
to
gape
and
crack
on
every
side
and
the
iron
was
totally
buried
in
the
wood
there
said
harry
this
first
wedge
has
done
its
business
very
well
two
or
three
more
will
finish
it
he
then
took
up
another
larger
wedge
and
inserting
the
bottom
of
it
between
the
wood
and
the
top
of
the
former
one
which
was
now
completely
buried
in
the
root
began
to
beat
upon
it
as
he
had
done
before
the
root
now
cracked
and
split
on
every
side
of
the
wedges
till
a
prodigious
cleft
appeared
quite
down
to
the
bottom
thus
did
harry
proceed
still
continuing
his
blows
and
inserting
new
and
larger
wedges
as
fast
as
he
had
driven
the
former
down
till
he
had
completely
effected
what
he
had
undertaken
and
entirely
separated
the
monstrous
mass
of
wood
into
two
unequal
parts
harry
then
said
here
is
a
very
large
log
but
i
think
you
and
i
can
carry
it
in
to
mend
the
fire
and
i
will
show
you
something
else
that
will
surprise
you
so
he
took
a
pole
of
about
ten
feet
long
and
hung
the
log
upon
it
by
a
piece
of
cord
which
he
found
there
then
he
asked
tommy
which
end
of
the
pole
he
chose
to
carry
tommy
who
thought
it
would
be
most
convenient
to
have
the
weight
near
him
chose
that
end
of
the
pole
near
which
the
weight
was
suspended
and
put
it
upon
his
shoulder
while
harry
took
the
other
end
but
when
tommy
attempted
to
move
he
found
that
he
could
hardly
bear
the
pressure
however
as
he
saw
harry
walk
briskly
away
under
his
share
of
the
load
he
determined
not
to
complain
as
they
were
walking
in
this
manner
mr
barlow
met
them
and
seeing
poor
tommy
labouring
under
his
burthen
asked
him
who
had
loaded
him
in
that
manner
tommy
said
it
was
harry
upon
this
mr
barlow
smiled
and
said
well
tommy
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
your
friend
harry
attempt
to
impose
upon
you
but
he
is
making
you
carry
about
three
times
the
weight
which
he
supports
himself
harry
replied
that
tommy
had
chosen
that
himself
and
that
he
should
directly
have
informed
him
of
his
mistake
but
that
he
had
been
so
surprised
at
seeing
the
common
effects
of
a
lever
that
he
wished
to
teach
him
some
other
facts
about
it
then
shifting
the
ends
of
the
pole
so
as
to
support
that
part
which
tommy
had
done
before
he
asked
him
if
he
found
his
shoulder
anything
easier
than
before
indeed
i
do
replied
tommy
but
i
can
not
conceive
how
for
we
carry
the
same
weight
between
us
which
we
did
before
and
just
in
the
same
manner
not
quite
in
the
same
manner
answered
mr
barlow
for
if
you
observe
the
log
is
a
great
deal
farther
from
your
shoulder
than
from
harry
by
which
means
he
now
supports
just
as
much
as
you
did
before
and
you
on
the
contrary
as
little
as
he
did
when
i
met
you
this
is
very
extraordinary
indeed
said
tommy
i
find
there
are
a
great
many
things
which
i
did
not
know
nor
even
my
mamma
nor
any
of
the
fine
ladies
that
come
to
our
house
well
replied
mr
barlow
if
you
have
acquired
so
much
useful
knowledge
already
what
may
you
expect
to
do
in
a
few
years
more
mr
barlow
then
led
tommy
into
the
house
and
showed
him
a
stick
of
about
four
feet
long
with
a
scale
hung
at
each
end
now
said
he
if
you
place
this
stick
over
the
back
of
a
chair
so
that
it
may
rest
exactly
upon
the
middle
you
see
the
two
scales
will
just
balance
each
other
so
if
i
put
into
each
of
them
an
equal
weight
they
will
still
remain
suspended
in
this
method
we
weigh
every
thing
which
is
bought
only
for
the
greater
convenience
the
beam
of
the
scale
which
is
the
same
thing
as
this
stick
is
generally
hung
up
to
something
else
by
its
middle
but
let
us
now
move
the
stick
and
see
what
will
be
the
consequence
mr
barlow
then
pushed
the
stick
along
in
such
a
manner
that
when
it
rested
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
there
were
three
feet
of
it
on
one
side
and
only
one
on
the
other
that
side
which
was
longest
instantly
came
to
the
ground
as
heaviest
you
see
said
mr
barlow
if
we
would
now
balance
them
we
must
put
a
greater
weight
on
the
shortest
side
so
he
kept
adding
weights
till
tommy
found
that
one
pound
on
the
longest
side
would
exactly
balance
three
on
the
shortest
for
as
much
as
the
longer
side
exceeded
the
shorter
in
length
so
much
did
the
weight
which
was
hung
at
that
end
require
to
exceed
that
on
the
longest
side
this
said
mr
barlow
is
what
they
call
a
and
all
the
sticks
that
you
have
been
using
are
only
levers
of
a
different
construction
by
these
short
trials
you
may
conceive
the
prodigious
advantage
which
they
are
of
to
men
for
thus
can
one
man
move
a
weight
which
could
not
be
able
to
do
with
their
hands
alone
thus
may
a
little
boy
like
you
do
more
than
the
strongest
man
could
effect
who
did
not
know
these
secrets
as
to
that
instrument
by
which
you
were
so
surprised
that
harry
could
cleave
such
a
vast
body
of
wood
it
is
called
a
wedge
and
is
almost
equally
useful
with
the
lever
the
whole
force
of
it
consists
in
its
being
gradually
narrower
and
narrower
till
at
last
it
ends
in
a
thin
edge
capable
of
penetrating
the
smallest
chink
by
this
we
are
enabled
to
overthrow
the
largest
oaks
to
cleave
their
roots
almost
as
hard
as
iron
itself
and
even
to
split
the
solid
rocks
all
this
said
tommy
is
wonderful
indeed
and
i
need
not
ask
the
use
of
them
because
i
see
it
plainly
in
the
experiments
i
have
made
one
thing
more
added
mr
barlow
as
we
are
upon
this
subject
i
will
show
you
so
he
led
them
into
the
yard
to
the
bottom
of
his
granary
where
stood
a
heavy
sack
of
corn
now
said
mr
barlow
if
you
are
so
stout
a
fellow
as
you
imagine
take
up
this
sack
of
corn
and
carry
it
up
the
ladder
into
the
granary
that
replied
tommy
laughing
is
impossible
and
i
doubt
sir
whether
you
could
do
it
yourself
well
said
mr
barlow
we
will
at
least
try
what
is
to
be
done
he
then
led
them
up
into
the
granary
and
showing
them
a
wheel
with
a
handle
fixed
upon
it
desired
the
little
boys
to
turn
it
round
they
began
to
turn
it
with
some
little
difficulty
and
tommy
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
when
presently
after
he
saw
the
sack
of
corn
which
he
had
despaired
of
moving
mounted
up
into
the
granary
and
safely
landed
upon
the
floor
you
see
said
mr
barlow
here
is
another
ingenious
contrivance
by
which
the
weakest
person
may
perform
the
work
of
the
strongest
this
is
called
the
and
you
see
this
wheel
which
is
not
very
large
turns
round
an
axle
which
goes
into
it
and
is
much
smaller
and
at
every
turn
the
rope
to
which
the
weight
is
fixed
that
you
want
to
move
is
twisted
round
the
axle
now
just
as
much
as
the
breadth
of
the
whole
wheel
is
greater
than
that
of
the
axle
which
it
turns
round
so
much
greater
is
the
weight
that
the
person
who
turns
it
can
move
than
he
could
do
without
it
well
said
tommy
i
see
it
is
a
fine
thing
indeed
to
acquire
knowledge
for
by
these
means
one
not
only
increases
one
understanding
but
one
bodily
strength
but
are
there
no
more
sir
of
these
ingenious
contrivances
for
i
should
like
to
understand
them
all
yes
answered
mr
barlow
there
are
more
and
all
of
them
you
shall
be
perfectly
acquainted
with
in
time
but
for
this
purpose
you
should
be
able
to
write
and
comprehend
something
of
arithmetic
what
is
arithmetic
sir
that
is
not
so
easy
to
make
you
understand
at
once
i
will
however
try
to
explain
it
do
you
see
the
grains
of
wheat
which
he
scattered
in
the
window
yes
sir
can
you
count
how
many
there
are
there
are
just
of
them
very
well
here
is
another
parcel
how
many
grains
are
there
just
fourteen
if
there
are
fourteen
grains
in
one
heap
and
in
the
other
how
many
grains
are
there
in
all
or
how
many
do
fourteen
and
make
tommy
was
unable
to
answer
and
mr
barlow
proposed
the
same
question
to
harry
who
answered
that
together
they
made
again
said
mr
barlow
i
will
put
the
two
heaps
together
and
then
how
many
will
there
be
now
look
i
have
just
taken
away
nineteen
from
the
number
how
many
do
you
think
remain
i
will
count
them
and
can
not
you
tell
without
counting
how
many
are
there
harry
twenty
sir
all
this
is
properly
the
art
of
arithmetic
which
is
the
same
as
that
of
counting
only
it
is
done
in
a
much
shorter
and
easier
way
without
the
trouble
of
having
the
things
always
before
you
thus
for
instance
if
you
wanted
to
know
how
many
were
in
this
sack
you
would
perhaps
be
a
week
in
counting
the
whole
number
indeed
i
believe
i
should
if
you
understood
arithmetic
you
might
do
it
in
five
minutes
that
is
extraordinary
indeed
i
can
hardly
conceive
it
possible
a
bushel
of
corn
weighs
about
fifty
pounds
this
sack
contains
four
bushels
so
that
there
are
just
two
hundred
pounds
weight
in
all
now
every
pound
contains
sixteen
ounces
and
sixteen
times
two
hundred
makes
hundred
ounces
so
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
count
the
number
of
grains
in
a
single
ounce
and
there
will
be
hundred
times
that
number
in
the
sack
i
declare
this
is
curious
indeed
and
i
should
like
to
learn
arithmetic
will
harry
and
you
teach
me
sir
you
know
we
are
always
ready
to
improve
you
but
before
we
leave
this
subject
i
must
tell
you
a
little
story
there
was
a
gentleman
who
was
extremely
fond
of
beautiful
horses
and
did
not
grudge
to
give
the
highest
prices
for
them
one
day
a
came
to
him
and
showed
him
one
so
handsome
that
he
thought
it
superior
to
all
he
had
ever
seen
before
he
mounted
him
and
found
his
paces
equally
excellent
for
though
he
was
full
of
spirit
he
was
gentle
and
tractable
as
could
be
wished
so
many
perfections
delighted
the
gentleman
and
he
eagerly
demanded
the
price
the
answered
that
he
would
bate
nothing
of
two
hundred
guineas
the
gentleman
although
he
admired
the
horse
would
not
consent
to
give
it
and
they
were
just
on
the
point
of
parting
as
the
man
was
turning
his
back
the
gentleman
called
out
to
him
and
said
there
no
possible
way
of
our
agreeing
for
i
would
give
you
anything
in
reason
for
such
a
beautiful
creature
replied
the
dealer
who
was
a
shrewd
fellow
and
perfectly
understood
calculation
you
do
not
like
to
give
me
two
hundred
guineas
will
you
give
me
a
farthing
for
the
first
nail
the
horse
has
in
his
shoe
two
farthings
for
the
second
four
for
the
third
and
so
go
doubling
throughout
the
whole
for
there
are
no
more
than
nails
in
all
his
shoes
the
gentleman
gladly
accepted
the
condition
and
ordered
the
horse
to
be
led
away
to
his
stables
this
fellow
must
have
been
a
very
great
blockhead
to
ask
two
hundred
guineas
and
then
to
take
a
few
farthings
for
his
horse
the
gentleman
was
of
the
same
opinion
however
the
added
do
not
mean
sir
to
tie
you
down
to
this
last
proposal
which
upon
consideration
you
may
like
as
little
as
the
first
all
that
i
require
is
that
if
you
are
dissatisfied
with
your
bargain
you
will
promise
to
pay
me
down
the
two
hundred
guineas
which
i
first
asked
this
the
gentleman
willingly
agreed
to
and
then
called
the
steward
to
calculate
the
sum
for
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
be
able
to
do
it
himself
the
steward
sat
down
with
his
pen
and
ink
and
after
some
time
gravely
wished
his
master
joy
and
asked
him
what
part
of
england
the
estate
was
situated
that
he
was
going
to
purchase
you
mad
replied
the
gentleman
is
not
an
estate
but
a
horse
that
i
have
just
bargained
for
and
here
is
the
owner
of
him
to
whom
i
am
going
to
pay
the
money
there
is
any
madness
sir
replied
the
steward
certainly
is
not
on
my
side
the
sum
you
have
ordered
me
to
calculate
comes
just
to
seventeen
thousand
four
hundred
and
pounds
besides
some
shillings
and
pence
and
surely
no
man
in
his
senses
would
give
this
price
for
a
horse
the
gentleman
was
more
surprised
than
he
had
ever
been
before
to
hear
the
assertion
of
his
steward
but
when
upon
examination
he
found
it
no
more
than
the
truth
he
was
very
glad
to
compound
for
his
foolish
agreement
by
giving
the
the
two
hundred
guineas
and
dismissing
him
this
is
quite
incredible
that
a
farthing
just
doubled
a
few
times
should
amount
to
such
a
prodigious
sum
however
i
am
determined
to
learn
arithmetic
that
i
may
not
be
imposed
upon
in
this
manner
for
i
think
a
gentleman
must
look
very
silly
in
such
a
situation
thus
had
tommy
a
new
employment
and
diversion
for
the
winter
nights
the
learning
arithmetic
almost
every
night
did
mr
barlow
and
harry
and
he
amuse
themselves
with
little
questions
that
related
to
numbers
by
which
means
tommy
became
in
a
short
time
so
expert
that
he
could
add
subtract
multiply
or
divide
almost
any
given
sum
with
little
trouble
and
great
exactness
but
he
did
not
for
this
forget
the
employment
of
observing
the
heavens
for
every
night
when
the
stars
appeared
bright
and
the
sky
was
unclouded
harry
and
he
observed
the
various
figures
and
positions
of
the
constellations
mr
barlow
gave
him
a
little
paper
globe
as
he
had
promised
and
tommy
immediately
marked
out
upon
the
top
his
first
and
favourite
constellation
of
charles
wain
a
little
while
after
that
he
observed
on
the
other
side
of
the
another
beautiful
assemblage
of
stars
which
was
always
opposite
to
wain
this
mr
barlow
told
him
was
called
chair
and
this
in
a
short
time
was
added
to
the
collection
one
night
as
tommy
was
looking
up
to
the
sky
in
the
southern
part
of
the
heavens
he
observed
so
remarkable
a
constellation
that
he
could
not
help
particularly
remarking
it
four
large
and
shining
stars
composed
the
ends
of
the
figure
which
was
almost
square
and
full
in
the
middle
appeared
three
more
placed
in
a
slanting
line
and
very
near
each
other
this
tommy
pointed
out
to
mr
barlow
and
begged
to
know
the
name
mr
barlow
answered
that
the
constellation
was
named
and
that
the
three
bright
stars
in
the
middle
were
called
his
belt
tommy
was
so
delighted
with
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
this
glorious
constellation
that
he
could
not
help
observing
it
by
intervals
all
the
evening
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
seemed
to
pass
on
in
a
right
line
drawn
from
east
to
west
and
that
all
the
stars
he
had
become
acquainted
with
moved
every
night
in
the
same
direction
but
he
did
not
forget
to
remind
harry
one
morning
of
the
history
he
had
promised
to
tell
him
of
agesilaus
harry
told
it
in
the
following
manner
history
of
agesilaus
the
spartans
as
i
have
before
told
you
master
tommy
were
a
brave
and
hardy
people
who
despised
everything
that
tended
to
make
them
delicate
and
luxurious
all
their
time
was
spent
in
such
exercises
as
made
them
strong
and
active
able
to
bear
fatigue
and
to
despise
wounds
and
danger
for
they
were
situated
in
the
midst
of
several
other
nations
that
frequently
had
quarrels
with
each
other
and
with
them
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
learn
to
defend
themselves
therefore
all
the
children
were
brought
up
alike
and
the
sons
of
their
kings
themselves
were
as
little
indulged
as
anybody
else
stop
stop
i
do
exactly
understand
that
i
thought
a
king
was
a
person
that
dressed
finer
and
had
less
to
do
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
i
have
often
heard
my
mamma
and
the
ladies
say
that
i
looked
like
a
prince
when
i
had
fine
clothes
on
and
therefore
i
thought
that
kings
and
princes
never
did
anything
but
walk
about
with
crowns
upon
their
heads
and
eat
sweetmeats
all
day
long
i
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
but
in
sparta
the
great
business
of
the
kings
for
they
had
two
was
to
command
them
when
they
went
out
to
war
or
when
they
were
attacked
at
home
and
that
you
know
they
could
not
do
without
being
brave
and
hardy
themselves
now
it
happened
that
the
spartans
had
some
dear
friends
and
allies
that
lived
at
a
distance
from
them
across
the
sea
who
were
attacked
by
a
great
and
numerous
nation
called
the
persians
so
when
the
spartans
knew
the
danger
of
their
friends
they
sent
over
to
their
assistance
agesilaus
one
of
their
kings
together
with
a
few
thousands
of
his
countrymen
and
these
they
judged
would
be
a
match
for
all
the
forces
that
could
be
brought
against
them
by
the
persians
though
ever
so
numerous
when
the
general
of
the
persians
saw
the
small
number
of
his
enemies
he
imagined
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
take
them
prisoners
or
to
destroy
them
besides
as
he
was
immensely
rich
and
possessed
a
number
of
palaces
furnished
with
everything
that
was
fine
and
costly
and
had
a
great
quantity
of
gold
and
silver
and
jewels
and
slaves
he
could
not
conceive
it
possible
that
anybody
could
resist
him
he
therefore
raised
a
large
army
several
times
greater
than
that
of
the
spartans
and
attacked
agesilaus
who
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
for
the
spartans
joining
their
shields
together
and
marching
slowly
along
in
even
ranks
fell
with
so
much
fury
upon
the
persians
that
in
an
instant
they
put
them
to
flight
here
tommy
interrupted
the
story
to
inquire
what
a
shield
was
formerly
answered
mr
barlow
before
men
were
acquainted
with
the
pernicious
effects
of
gunpowder
they
were
accustomed
to
combat
close
together
with
swords
or
long
spears
and
for
this
reason
they
covered
themselves
in
a
variety
of
ways
to
defend
their
bodies
from
the
weapons
of
their
enemies
the
shield
was
worn
upon
their
left
arm
and
composed
of
boards
fixed
together
and
strengthened
with
the
hides
of
animals
and
plates
of
iron
sufficiently
long
and
broad
to
cover
almost
the
whole
body
of
a
man
when
they
went
out
to
battle
they
placed
themselves
in
even
rows
or
ranks
with
their
shields
extended
before
them
to
secure
them
from
the
arrows
and
weapons
of
their
enemies
upon
their
heads
they
wore
a
helmet
which
was
a
cap
of
iron
or
steel
ornamented
with
the
waving
feathers
of
birds
or
the
tails
of
horses
in
this
manner
with
an
even
pace
marching
all
at
once
and
extending
their
spears
before
them
they
went
forward
to
meet
their
enemies
i
declare
said
tommy
that
an
army
in
full
march
in
such
array
must
have
been
prodigiously
fine
and
when
i
have
accidentally
met
with
soldiers
myself
i
thought
they
made
such
a
figure
walking
erect
with
their
arms
all
glittering
in
the
sun
that
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
would
be
a
soldier
myself
whenever
i
grew
big
enough
this
of
tommy
brings
to
my
recollection
said
mr
barlow
a
circumstance
that
once
occurred
in
the
french
army
which
i
can
not
help
relating
after
an
execution
had
taken
place
in
paris
of
a
nobleman
who
had
been
convicted
of
treason
which
was
no
uncommon
thing
at
that
time
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
who
had
been
in
attendance
during
the
tragic
scene
ordered
his
men
to
their
usual
place
of
exercise
while
engaged
in
reviewing
the
troops
his
attention
was
drawn
to
a
young
man
who
had
been
for
some
time
concealed
behind
a
tree
who
coming
forward
and
falling
upon
his
knees
entreated
the
general
in
an
imploring
manner
to
permit
him
to
enter
into
his
regiment
declaring
that
he
had
from
a
child
felt
the
most
ardent
desire
to
be
a
soldier
the
general
gazed
intently
upon
him
and
instantly
recognised
in
the
young
man
the
child
of
his
own
beloved
brother
who
had
been
lost
for
many
years
and
was
supposed
to
be
dead
but
i
interrupt
let
harry
now
go
on
with
his
story
when
pharnabazus
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
persian
general
observed
that
his
troops
were
never
able
to
stand
against
the
spartans
he
sent
to
agesilaus
and
requested
that
they
might
have
a
meeting
in
order
to
treat
about
terms
of
peace
this
the
spartan
consented
to
and
appointed
the
time
and
place
where
he
would
wait
for
pharnabazus
when
the
day
came
agesilaus
arrived
first
at
the
place
of
meeting
with
the
spartans
but
not
seeing
pharnabazus
he
sat
down
upon
the
grass
with
his
soldiers
and
as
it
was
the
hour
of
the
army
making
their
repast
they
pulled
out
their
provisions
which
consisted
of
some
coarse
bread
and
onions
and
began
eating
very
heartily
in
the
middle
of
them
sat
king
agesilaus
himself
in
nowise
distinguished
from
the
rest
neither
by
his
clothing
nor
his
fare
nor
was
there
in
the
whole
army
an
individual
who
more
exposed
himself
to
every
species
of
hardship
or
discovered
less
nicety
than
the
king
himself
by
which
means
he
was
beloved
and
reverenced
by
all
the
soldiers
who
were
ashamed
of
appearing
less
brave
or
patient
than
their
general
it
was
not
long
that
the
spartans
had
thus
reposed
before
the
first
servants
of
pharnabazus
arrived
who
brought
with
them
rich
and
costly
carpets
which
they
spread
upon
the
ground
for
their
master
to
recline
upon
presently
arrived
another
troop
who
began
to
erect
a
spacious
tent
with
silken
hangings
to
screen
him
and
his
train
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
after
this
came
a
company
of
cooks
and
confectioners
with
a
great
number
of
loaded
horses
who
carried
upon
their
backs
all
the
materials
of
an
elegant
entertainment
last
of
all
appeared
pharnabazus
himself
glittering
with
gold
and
jewels
and
adorned
with
a
long
purple
robe
after
the
fashion
of
the
east
he
wore
bracelets
upon
his
arms
and
was
mounted
upon
a
beautiful
horse
that
was
as
gaudily
attired
as
himself
as
he
approached
nearer
and
beheld
the
simple
manners
of
the
spartan
king
and
his
soldiers
he
could
not
help
scoffing
at
their
poverty
and
making
comparisons
between
their
mean
appearance
and
his
own
magnificence
all
that
were
with
him
seemed
to
be
infinitely
diverted
with
the
wit
and
acute
remarks
of
their
general
except
a
single
person
who
had
served
in
the
grecian
armies
and
therefore
was
better
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
discipline
of
these
people
this
man
was
highly
valued
by
pharnabazus
for
his
understanding
and
honesty
and
therefore
when
he
observed
that
he
said
nothing
he
insisted
upon
his
declaring
his
sentiments
as
the
rest
had
done
then
replied
he
command
me
to
speak
my
opinion
o
pharnabazus
i
must
confess
that
the
very
circumstance
which
is
the
cause
of
so
much
mirth
to
the
gentlemen
that
accompany
you
is
the
reason
of
my
fears
on
our
side
indeed
i
see
gold
and
jewels
and
purple
in
abundance
but
when
i
look
for
men
i
can
find
nothing
but
barbers
cooks
confectioners
fiddlers
dancers
and
everything
that
is
most
unmanly
and
unfit
for
war
on
the
grecian
side
i
discern
none
of
the
costly
trifles
but
i
see
iron
that
forms
their
weapons
and
composes
impenetrable
arms
i
see
men
who
have
been
brought
up
to
despise
every
hardship
and
face
every
danger
who
are
accustomed
to
observe
their
ranks
to
obey
their
leader
to
take
every
advantage
of
their
enemy
and
to
fall
dead
in
their
places
rather
than
to
turn
their
backs
were
the
contest
about
who
should
dress
a
dinner
or
curl
hair
with
the
greatest
nicety
i
should
not
doubt
that
the
persians
would
gain
the
advantage
but
when
it
is
necessary
to
contend
in
battle
where
the
prize
is
won
by
hardiness
and
valour
i
can
not
help
dreading
men
who
are
inured
to
wounds
and
labours
and
suffering
nor
can
i
ever
think
that
the
persian
gold
will
be
able
to
resist
the
grecian
iron
pharnabazus
was
so
struck
with
the
truth
and
justness
of
these
remarks
that
from
that
very
hour
he
determined
to
contend
no
more
with
such
invincible
troops
but
bent
all
his
care
towards
making
peace
with
the
spartans
by
which
means
he
preserved
himself
and
country
from
destruction
you
see
by
this
story
said
mr
barlow
that
fine
clothes
are
not
always
of
the
consequence
you
imagine
since
they
are
not
able
to
give
their
wearers
either
more
strength
or
courage
than
they
had
before
nor
to
preserve
them
from
the
attacks
of
those
whose
appearance
is
more
homely
but
since
you
are
so
little
acquainted
with
the
business
of
a
soldier
i
must
show
you
a
little
more
clearly
in
what
it
consists
instead
therefore
of
all
this
pageantry
which
seems
so
strongly
to
have
acted
upon
your
mind
i
must
inform
you
that
there
is
no
human
being
exposed
to
suffer
a
greater
degree
of
hardship
he
is
often
obliged
to
march
whole
days
in
the
most
violent
heat
or
cold
or
rain
and
frequently
without
victuals
to
eat
or
clothes
to
cover
him
and
when
he
stops
at
night
the
most
that
he
can
expect
is
a
miserable
canvas
tent
to
shelter
him
which
is
penetrated
in
every
part
by
the
wet
and
a
little
straw
to
keep
his
body
from
the
damp
unwholesome
earth
frequently
he
can
not
meet
with
even
this
and
is
obliged
to
lie
uncovered
upon
the
ground
by
which
means
he
contracts
a
thousand
diseases
which
are
more
fatal
than
the
cannon
and
weapons
of
the
enemy
every
hour
he
is
exposed
to
engage
in
combats
at
the
hazard
of
losing
his
limbs
of
being
crippled
or
mortally
wounded
if
he
gain
the
victory
he
generally
has
only
to
begin
again
and
fight
anew
till
the
war
is
over
if
he
be
beaten
he
may
probably
lose
his
life
upon
the
spot
or
be
taken
prisoner
by
the
enemy
in
which
case
he
may
languish
several
months
in
a
dreary
prison
in
want
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
alas
said
harry
what
a
dreadful
picture
do
you
draw
of
the
fate
of
those
brave
men
who
suffer
so
much
to
defend
their
country
surely
those
who
employ
them
should
take
care
of
them
when
they
are
sick
or
wounded
or
incapable
of
providing
for
themselves
so
indeed
answered
mr
barlow
they
ought
to
do
but
rash
and
foolish
men
engage
in
wars
without
either
justice
or
reason
and
when
they
are
over
they
think
no
more
of
the
unhappy
people
who
have
served
them
at
so
much
loss
to
themselves
why
sir
i
have
often
thought
that
as
all
wars
consists
in
shedding
blood
and
doing
mischief
to
our
they
seldom
can
be
just
you
are
indeed
right
there
of
all
the
blood
that
has
been
shed
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
the
present
day
but
very
little
indeed
has
been
owing
to
any
cause
that
had
either
justice
or
common
sense
i
then
have
thought
though
i
pity
poor
soldiers
extremely
and
always
give
them
something
if
i
have
any
money
in
my
pocket
that
they
draw
these
mischiefs
upon
themselves
because
they
endeavour
to
kill
and
destroy
other
people
and
therefore
if
they
suffer
the
same
evils
in
return
they
can
hardly
complain
they
can
not
complain
of
the
evils
to
which
they
voluntarily
expose
themselves
but
they
may
justly
complain
of
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
for
whom
they
fight
and
who
take
no
care
of
them
afterwards
indeed
sir
i
think
so
but
i
can
not
conceive
why
people
must
hire
others
to
fight
for
them
if
it
is
necessary
to
fight
why
not
fight
for
themselves
i
should
be
ashamed
to
go
to
another
boy
and
say
to
him
pray
go
and
venture
your
life
or
limbs
for
me
that
i
may
stay
at
home
and
do
nothing
what
if
the
french
were
to
come
here
as
they
said
they
were
about
to
do
would
you
go
out
to
fight
them
yourself
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
it
was
every
man
duty
to
fight
for
his
country
if
it
were
attacked
and
if
my
father
went
out
to
fight
i
would
go
out
with
him
i
would
not
willingly
hurt
anybody
but
if
they
attempt
to
hurt
me
or
my
countrymen
we
should
do
right
to
defend
ourselves
should
we
not
sir
this
is
certainly
a
case
where
men
have
a
right
to
defend
themselves
no
man
is
bound
to
yield
his
life
or
property
to
another
that
has
no
right
to
take
it
among
those
grecians
whom
you
were
talking
of
every
man
was
a
soldier
and
always
ready
to
defend
his
country
whenever
it
was
attacked
pray
dear
sir
read
to
master
tommy
the
story
of
leonidas
which
gave
me
so
much
pleasure
i
am
sure
he
will
like
to
hear
it
mr
barlow
accordingly
read
the
history
of
leonidas
king
of
sparta
the
king
of
persia
commanded
a
great
extent
of
territory
which
was
inhabited
by
many
millions
of
people
and
not
only
abounded
in
all
the
necessaries
of
life
but
produced
immense
quantities
of
gold
and
silver
and
every
other
costly
thing
yet
all
this
did
not
satisfy
the
haughty
mind
of
xerxes
who
at
that
time
possessed
the
empire
of
this
country
he
considered
that
the
grecians
his
neighbours
were
free
and
refused
to
obey
his
imperious
orders
which
he
foolishly
imagined
all
mankind
should
respect
he
therefore
determined
to
make
an
expedition
with
a
mighty
army
into
greece
and
to
conquer
the
country
for
this
reason
he
raised
such
a
prodigious
army
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
describe
it
the
number
of
men
that
composed
it
seemed
sufficient
to
conquer
the
whole
world
and
all
the
forces
the
grecians
were
able
to
raise
would
scarcely
amount
to
a
hundredth
part
nevertheless
the
grecians
held
public
councils
to
consult
about
their
common
safety
and
they
nobly
determined
that
as
they
had
hitherto
lived
free
so
they
would
either
maintain
their
liberty
or
bravely
die
in
its
defence
in
the
mean
time
xerxes
was
continually
marching
forward
and
at
length
entered
the
territory
of
greece
the
grecians
had
not
yet
been
able
to
assemble
their
troops
or
make
their
preparations
and
therefore
they
were
struck
with
consternation
at
the
approach
of
such
an
army
as
attended
xerxes
leonidas
was
at
that
time
king
of
sparta
and
when
he
considered
the
state
of
affairs
he
saw
one
method
alone
by
which
the
ruin
of
his
country
and
all
greece
could
be
prevented
in
order
to
enter
the
more
cultivated
parts
of
this
country
it
was
necessary
for
the
persian
army
to
march
through
a
very
rough
and
mountainous
district
called
thermopylæ
there
was
only
one
narrow
road
through
all
these
mountains
which
it
was
possible
for
only
a
very
small
number
of
men
to
defend
for
some
time
against
the
most
numerous
army
leonidas
perceived
that
if
a
small
number
of
resolute
men
would
undertake
to
defend
this
passage
it
would
retard
the
march
of
the
whole
persian
army
and
give
the
grecians
time
to
collect
their
troops
but
who
would
undertake
so
desperate
an
enterprise
where
there
was
scarcely
any
possibility
of
escaping
alive
for
this
reason
leonidas
determined
to
undertake
the
expedition
himself
with
such
of
the
spartans
as
would
voluntarily
attend
him
and
to
sacrifice
his
own
life
for
the
preservation
of
his
country
with
this
design
he
assembled
the
chief
persons
of
sparta
and
laid
before
them
the
necessity
of
defending
the
pass
of
thermopylæ
they
were
equally
convinced
of
its
importance
but
knew
not
where
to
find
a
man
of
such
determined
valour
as
to
undertake
it
said
leonidas
there
is
no
more
worthy
man
ready
to
perform
this
service
i
myself
will
undertake
it
with
those
who
will
voluntarily
accompany
me
they
were
struck
with
admiration
at
his
proposal
and
praised
the
greatness
of
his
mind
but
set
before
him
the
certain
destruction
which
must
attend
him
this
said
leonidas
have
already
considered
but
i
am
determined
to
go
with
the
appearance
indeed
of
defending
the
pass
of
thermopylæ
but
in
reality
to
die
for
the
liberty
of
greece
saying
this
he
instantly
went
out
of
the
assembly
and
prepared
for
the
expedition
taking
with
him
about
three
hundred
spartans
before
he
went
he
embraced
his
wife
who
hung
about
him
in
tears
as
being
well
acquainted
with
the
dangerous
purposes
of
his
march
but
he
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
and
told
her
that
a
short
life
was
well
sacrificed
to
the
interests
of
his
country
and
that
spartan
women
should
be
more
careful
about
the
glory
than
the
safety
of
their
husbands
he
then
kissed
his
infant
children
and
charging
his
wife
to
educate
them
in
the
same
principles
he
had
lived
in
went
out
of
his
house
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
those
brave
men
who
were
to
accompany
him
as
they
marched
through
the
city
all
the
inhabitants
attended
them
with
praises
and
acclamations
the
young
women
sang
songs
of
triumph
and
scattered
flowers
before
them
the
youths
were
jealous
of
their
glory
and
lamented
that
such
a
noble
doom
had
not
rather
fallen
upon
themselves
while
all
their
friends
and
relations
seemed
rather
to
exult
in
the
immortal
honour
they
were
going
to
acquire
than
to
be
dejected
with
the
apprehensions
of
their
loss
and
as
they
continued
their
march
through
greece
they
were
joined
by
various
bodies
of
their
allies
so
that
their
number
amounted
to
about
six
thousand
when
they
took
possession
of
the
straits
of
thermopylæ
in
a
short
time
xerxes
approached
with
his
innumerable
army
which
was
composed
of
various
nations
and
armed
in
a
thousand
different
manners
and
when
he
had
seen
the
small
number
of
his
enemies
he
could
not
believe
that
they
really
meant
to
oppose
his
passage
but
when
he
was
told
that
this
was
surely
their
design
he
sent
out
a
small
detachment
of
his
troops
and
ordered
them
to
take
those
grecians
alive
and
bring
them
bound
before
him
the
persian
troops
set
out
and
attacked
the
grecians
with
considerable
fury
but
in
an
instant
they
were
routed
the
greater
part
slain
and
the
rest
obliged
to
fly
xerxes
was
enraged
at
this
misfortune
and
ordered
the
combat
to
be
renewed
with
greater
forces
the
attack
was
renewed
but
always
with
the
same
success
although
he
sent
the
bravest
troops
in
his
whole
army
thus
was
this
immense
army
stopped
in
its
career
and
the
pride
of
their
monarch
humbled
by
so
inconsiderable
a
body
of
grecians
that
they
were
not
at
first
thought
worthy
of
a
serious
attack
at
length
what
xerxes
with
all
his
troops
was
incapable
of
effecting
was
performed
by
the
treachery
of
some
of
the
grecians
who
inhabited
that
country
for
a
great
reward
they
undertook
to
lead
a
chosen
body
of
the
persians
across
the
mountains
by
a
secret
path
with
which
they
alone
were
acquainted
accordingly
the
persians
set
out
in
the
night
and
having
passed
over
the
mountains
in
safety
encamped
on
the
other
side
as
soon
as
day
arose
leonidas
perceived
that
he
had
been
betrayed
and
that
he
was
surrounded
by
the
enemy
nevertheless
with
the
same
undaunted
courage
he
took
all
necessary
measures
and
prepared
for
the
fate
which
he
had
long
resolved
to
meet
after
praising
and
thanking
the
allies
for
the
bravery
with
which
they
had
behaved
he
sent
them
all
away
to
their
respective
countries
many
of
the
spartans
too
he
would
have
dismissed
under
various
pretences
but
they
who
were
all
determined
rather
to
perish
with
their
king
than
to
return
refused
to
go
when
he
saw
their
resolution
he
consented
that
they
should
stay
with
him
and
share
in
his
fate
all
day
therefore
he
remained
quiet
in
his
camp
but
when
evening
approached
he
ordered
his
troops
to
take
some
refreshment
and
smiling
told
them
dine
like
men
who
were
to
sup
in
another
world
they
then
completely
armed
themselves
and
waited
for
the
middle
of
the
night
which
leonidas
judged
most
proper
for
the
design
he
meditated
he
saw
that
the
persians
would
never
imagine
it
possible
that
such
an
insignificant
body
of
men
should
think
of
attacking
their
numerous
forces
he
was
therefore
determined
in
the
silence
of
the
night
to
break
into
their
camp
and
endeavour
amid
the
terror
and
confusion
which
would
ensue
to
surprise
xerxes
himself
about
midnight
therefore
this
determined
body
of
grecians
marched
out
with
leonidas
at
their
head
they
soon
broke
into
the
persian
camp
and
put
all
to
flight
that
dared
to
oppose
them
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
terror
and
confusion
which
ensued
among
so
many
thousands
thus
unexpectedly
surprised
still
the
grecians
marched
on
in
close
impenetrable
order
overturning
the
tents
destroying
all
that
dared
to
resist
and
driving
that
vast
and
mighty
army
like
frightened
sheep
before
them
at
length
they
came
even
to
the
imperial
tent
of
xerxes
and
had
he
not
quitted
it
at
the
first
alarm
he
would
there
have
ended
at
once
his
life
and
expedition
the
grecians
in
an
instant
put
all
the
guards
to
flight
and
rushing
upon
the
imperial
pavilion
violently
overturned
it
and
trampled
under
their
feet
all
the
costly
furniture
and
vessels
of
gold
which
were
used
by
the
monarchs
of
persia
but
now
the
morning
began
to
appear
and
the
persians
who
had
discovered
the
small
number
of
their
assailants
surrounded
them
on
every
side
and
without
daring
to
come
to
a
close
engagement
poured
in
their
darts
and
other
missive
weapons
the
grecians
were
wearied
even
with
the
toils
of
conquest
and
their
body
was
already
considerably
diminished
nevertheless
leonidas
who
was
yet
alive
led
on
the
intrepid
few
that
yet
remained
to
a
fresh
attack
again
he
rushed
upon
the
persians
and
pierced
their
thickest
battalions
as
often
as
he
could
reach
them
but
valour
itself
was
vain
against
such
inequality
of
numbers
at
every
charge
the
grecian
ranks
grew
thinner
and
thinner
till
at
length
they
were
all
destroyed
without
a
single
man
having
quitted
his
post
or
turned
his
back
upon
the
enemy
really
said
tommy
when
the
history
was
finished
leonidas
was
a
brave
man
indeed
but
what
became
of
xerxes
and
his
army
after
the
death
of
this
valiant
spartan
was
he
able
to
overcome
the
grecians
or
did
they
repulse
him
you
are
now
able
to
read
for
yourself
replied
mr
barlow
and
therefore
by
examining
the
histories
of
those
countries
you
may
be
informed
of
everything
you
desire

mr
barlow
poor
parishioners
his
annual
dinner
tommy
attempts
sledge
driving
his
mishap
in
the
pond
his
anger
and
now
the
frost
had
continued
for
several
weeks
and
tommy
had
taken
advantage
of
the
evenings
which
generally
proved
clear
and
to
improve
his
knowledge
of
the
heavens
he
had
already
ornamented
his
paper
globe
with
several
of
the
most
remarkable
constellations
around
the
he
had
discovered
perseus
and
andromeda
and
cepheus
and
cassiopeia
chair
between
these
and
the
bright
orion
which
rose
every
night
and
glittered
in
the
south
he
discovered
seven
small
stars
that
were
set
in
a
cluster
and
called
the
pleiades
then
underneath
orion
he
discovered
another
glittering
star
called
sirius
or
the
all
these
he
continually
observed
journeyed
every
night
from
east
to
west
and
then
appeared
the
evening
after
in
their
former
places
how
strange
it
is
observed
tommy
one
day
to
mr
barlow
that
all
these
stars
should
be
continually
turning
about
the
earth
how
do
you
know
replied
mr
barlow
that
they
turn
at
all
because
i
see
them
move
every
night
but
how
are
you
sure
that
it
is
the
stars
which
move
every
night
and
not
the
earth
itself
tommy
considered
and
said
but
then
i
should
see
the
earth
move
and
the
stars
stand
still
what
did
you
never
ride
in
a
coach
yes
sir
very
often
and
did
you
then
see
that
the
coach
moved
as
you
sat
still
and
went
along
a
level
road
no
sir
i
protest
i
have
often
thought
that
the
houses
and
trees
and
all
the
country
glided
swiftly
along
by
the
windows
of
the
coach
and
did
you
never
sail
in
a
boat
yes
i
have
and
i
protest
i
have
observed
the
same
thing
for
i
remember
i
have
often
thought
the
shore
was
running
away
from
the
boat
instead
of
the
boat
from
the
shore
if
that
is
the
case
it
is
possible
even
though
the
earth
should
move
instead
of
the
stars
that
you
might
only
see
what
you
do
at
present
and
imagine
that
the
earth
you
are
upon
was
at
rest
but
is
it
not
more
likely
that
such
little
things
as
the
stars
and
the
sun
should
move
than
such
a
large
thing
as
the
earth
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
stars
and
sun
are
so
small
i
see
them
to
be
so
sir
the
stars
are
so
small
that
they
are
hardly
to
be
seen
at
all
and
the
sun
itself
which
is
much
bigger
does
not
seem
bigger
than
a
small
round
table
the
day
after
this
conversation
as
the
weather
was
bright
and
clear
mr
barlow
went
out
to
walk
with
harry
and
tommy
as
by
this
time
tommy
was
inured
to
fatigue
and
able
to
walk
many
miles
they
continued
their
excursion
over
the
hills
till
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
the
sea
as
they
were
diverting
themselves
with
the
immense
prospect
of
water
that
was
before
them
mr
barlow
perceived
something
floating
at
a
distance
so
small
as
to
be
scarcely
discernible
by
the
eye
he
pointed
it
out
to
tommy
who
with
some
difficulty
was
able
to
distinguish
it
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
it
was
tommy
answered
that
he
imagined
it
to
be
some
little
but
could
not
well
tell
on
account
of
the
distance
if
you
do
not
then
see
a
ship
what
is
it
you
do
see
or
what
does
that
object
appear
to
your
eyes
all
that
i
can
see
is
no
more
than
a
little
dusky
speck
which
seems
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
and
what
is
the
reason
it
grows
bigger
and
bigger
because
it
comes
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
what
then
does
the
same
thing
sometimes
appear
small
and
sometimes
great
yes
sir
it
seems
small
when
it
is
at
a
great
distance
for
i
have
observed
even
houses
and
churches
when
you
are
at
some
distance
seem
to
the
eye
very
small
indeed
and
now
i
observe
that
the
vessel
is
sailing
towards
us
and
it
is
not
as
i
imagined
a
little
but
a
ship
with
a
mast
for
i
begin
to
distinguish
the
sails
mr
barlow
walked
on
a
little
while
by
the
side
of
the
sea
and
presently
tommy
called
out
again
i
protest
i
was
mistaken
again
for
it
is
not
a
vessel
with
one
mast
as
i
thought
a
little
while
ago
but
a
fine
large
ship
with
three
great
masts
and
all
her
sails
before
the
wind
i
believe
she
must
either
be
a
large
merchantman
or
else
a
frigate
will
you
then
take
notice
of
what
you
have
now
been
saying
what
was
first
only
a
little
dusky
speck
became
a
vessel
with
one
mast
and
now
this
vessel
with
one
mast
plainly
appears
a
ship
of
a
very
large
size
with
all
her
masts
and
sails
and
rigging
complete
yet
all
these
three
appearances
are
only
the
same
object
at
different
distances
from
your
eye
yes
sir
that
is
all
very
true
indeed
why
then
if
the
ship
which
is
now
full
in
sight
were
to
tack
about
again
and
sail
away
from
us
as
fast
as
she
approached
just
now
what
do
you
think
would
happen
it
would
grow
less
and
less
every
minute
till
it
appeared
a
speck
again
you
said
i
think
that
the
sun
was
a
very
small
body
not
bigger
than
a
round
table
yes
sir
supposing
then
the
sun
were
to
be
removed
to
a
much
greater
distance
than
it
is
now
what
would
happen
would
it
appear
the
same
to
your
eyes
tommy
considered
some
time
and
then
said
if
the
ship
grows
less
and
less
till
at
last
it
appears
a
mere
speck
by
going
farther
and
farther
i
should
think
the
sun
would
do
the
same
there
you
are
perfectly
right
therefore
if
the
sun
were
to
depart
farther
and
farther
from
us
at
last
it
would
appear
no
bigger
than
one
of
those
twinkling
stars
that
you
see
at
so
great
a
distance
above
your
head
that
i
perfectly
comprehend
but
if
on
the
contrary
one
of
those
twinkling
stars
were
to
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
where
you
stand
what
do
think
would
happen
would
it
still
appear
of
the
same
size
no
sir
the
ship
as
it
came
nearer
to
us
appeared
every
moment
larger
and
therefore
i
think
the
star
must
do
the
same
might
it
not
then
appear
as
big
as
the
sun
now
does
just
as
the
sun
would
dwindle
away
to
the
size
of
a
star
were
it
to
be
removed
to
a
still
greater
distance
indeed
i
think
it
might
what
then
do
you
imagine
must
happen
could
the
sun
approach
a
great
deal
nearer
to
us
would
its
size
remain
the
same
no
i
plainly
see
that
it
must
appear
bigger
and
bigger
the
nearer
it
comes
if
that
is
the
case
it
is
not
so
very
certain
that
the
earth
we
inhabit
is
bigger
than
the
sun
and
stars
they
are
at
a
very
great
distance
from
us
therefore
if
anybody
could
go
from
the
earth
towards
the
sun
how
do
you
think
the
earth
would
appear
to
him
as
he
journeyed
on
really
i
can
hardly
tell
no
why
is
it
not
the
same
thing
whether
an
object
goes
from
you
or
you
from
the
object
is
there
any
difference
between
the
ship
sailing
away
from
us
and
our
walking
away
from
the
ship
no
sir
did
you
not
say
that
if
the
sun
could
be
removed
farther
from
our
eyes
it
would
appear
less
to
be
sure
it
would
why
then
if
the
earth
were
to
sink
down
from
under
our
feet
lower
and
lower
what
would
happen
would
it
have
the
same
appearance
no
sir
i
think
it
must
appear
less
and
less
like
the
ship
that
is
sailing
away
very
right
indeed
but
now
attend
to
what
i
asked
you
just
now
if
a
person
could
rise
slowly
into
the
air
and
mount
still
higher
and
higher
towards
the
sun
what
would
happen
why
the
same
as
if
the
earth
were
to
sink
from
under
us
it
would
appear
less
and
less
might
not
the
earth
then
at
least
appear
as
small
as
the
sun
or
moon
does
i
can
hardly
conceive
that
and
yet
i
see
it
would
appear
less
and
less
the
farther
we
went
do
you
remember
what
happened
to
you
when
you
left
the
island
of
jamaica
yes
i
do
one
of
the
blacks
held
me
upon
the
deck
and
then
i
looked
towards
the
island
and
i
thought
that
it
began
to
move
away
from
the
ship
though
in
reality
it
was
the
ship
moving
away
from
the
land
and
then
as
the
ship
continued
sailing
along
the
water
the
island
appeared
less
and
less
first
i
lost
sight
of
the
trees
and
houses
that
stood
on
the
shore
and
then
i
could
only
see
the
highest
mountains
and
then
i
could
scarcely
see
the
mountains
themselves
and
at
last
the
whole
island
appeared
only
like
a
dark
mist
above
the
water
and
then
the
mist
itself
disappeared
and
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
vast
extent
of
water
all
round
and
the
sky
above
and
must
not
this
be
exactly
the
case
if
you
could
rise
up
into
the
air
higher
and
higher
and
look
down
upon
the
earth
indeed
it
must
now
then
you
will
be
able
to
answer
the
question
i
asked
you
a
little
while
ago
could
a
person
travel
straight
forward
from
the
earth
to
the
sun
how
would
they
both
appear
to
him
as
he
went
forward
the
earth
would
appear
less
and
less
as
he
went
from
it
and
the
sun
bigger
and
bigger
why
then
perhaps
it
would
happen
at
last
that
the
sun
appeared
bigger
than
the
earth
indeed
it
might
then
you
see
that
you
must
no
longer
talk
of
the
being
large
and
the
sun
small
since
that
may
only
happen
because
you
are
nearer
the
one
and
at
a
great
distance
from
the
other
at
least
you
may
now
be
convinced
that
both
the
sun
and
stars
must
be
immensely
bigger
than
you
would
at
first
sight
guess
them
to
be
as
they
were
returning
home
they
happened
to
pass
through
a
small
town
on
their
way
and
saw
a
crowd
of
people
going
into
a
house
which
gave
mr
barlow
the
curiosity
to
inquire
the
reason
they
were
told
that
there
was
a
wonderful
person
there
who
performed
a
variety
of
strange
and
diverting
experiments
on
tommy
expressing
a
great
desire
to
see
these
curious
exhibitions
mr
barlow
took
them
both
in
and
they
all
seated
themselves
among
the
audience
presently
the
performer
began
his
exhibitions
which
very
much
diverted
tommy
and
surprised
the
spectators
at
length
after
a
variety
of
curious
tricks
upon
the
cards
the
conjuror
desired
them
to
observe
a
large
basin
of
water
with
the
figure
of
a
little
swan
floating
upon
the
surface
gentlemen
said
the
man
i
have
reserved
this
curious
experiment
for
the
last
because
it
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
that
i
have
to
show
or
that
perhaps
was
ever
exhibited
to
the
present
hour
you
see
that
swan
it
is
no
more
than
a
little
image
without
either
sense
or
life
if
you
have
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
take
it
up
in
your
hands
and
examine
it
accordingly
several
of
the
spectators
took
it
up
in
their
hands
and
after
having
examined
it
set
it
down
upon
the
water
now
continued
he
this
swan
which
to
you
appears
totally
without
sense
or
motion
is
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
that
he
knows
me
his
master
and
will
follow
in
any
direction
that
i
command
saying
this
he
took
out
a
little
piece
of
bread
and
whistling
to
his
bird
ordered
him
to
come
to
the
side
of
the
basin
to
be
fed
immediately
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
the
company
the
swan
turned
about
and
swam
to
the
side
of
the
basin
the
man
whistled
again
and
presently
the
swan
turned
himself
round
and
pursued
the
hand
of
his
master
to
the
other
side
of
the
basin
the
spectators
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
and
some
of
them
got
little
pieces
of
bread
and
held
them
out
imagining
that
he
would
do
the
same
to
them
but
it
was
in
vain
they
whistled
and
presented
their
bread
the
bird
remained
unmoved
upon
the
water
and
obeyed
no
orders
but
those
of
his
master
when
this
exhibition
had
been
repeated
over
and
over
again
to
the
extreme
delight
and
astonishment
of
all
present
the
company
rose
and
dispersed
and
mr
barlow
and
the
little
boys
pursued
their
way
home
but
tommy
mind
was
so
engaged
with
what
he
had
seen
that
for
several
days
he
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
he
would
give
all
that
he
had
in
the
world
to
find
out
this
curious
trick
and
to
be
possessed
of
such
a
swan
at
length
as
he
was
one
day
talking
to
harry
upon
this
subject
harry
told
him
with
a
smile
that
he
believed
he
had
found
out
a
method
of
doing
it
and
that
if
he
did
not
mistake
he
would
the
next
day
show
him
a
swan
that
would
come
to
be
fed
as
well
as
the
conjuror
accordingly
harry
moulded
a
bit
of
wax
into
the
shape
of
a
swan
and
placed
it
upon
a
basin
of
water
he
then
presented
to
it
a
piece
of
bread
and
to
the
inexpressible
delight
of
tommy
the
swan
pursued
the
bread
just
as
he
had
seen
before
after
he
had
several
times
diverted
himself
with
this
experiment
he
wanted
to
be
informed
of
the
composition
of
this
wonderful
swan
harry
therefore
showed
him
within
the
body
of
the
bird
a
large
needle
which
lay
across
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
in
the
bread
with
which
the
swan
was
fed
he
also
showed
him
concealed
a
small
bar
of
iron
tommy
could
not
comprehend
all
this
although
he
saw
it
before
his
eyes
but
mr
barlow
who
was
present
taking
up
the
bar
of
iron
and
putting
down
several
needles
upon
the
table
tommy
was
infinitely
surprised
to
see
the
needles
all
jump
up
one
after
another
at
the
approach
of
the
bar
and
shoot
towards
it
as
if
they
had
been
possessed
of
life
and
sense
they
then
hung
all
about
the
bar
so
firmly
that
though
it
was
lifted
into
the
air
they
all
remained
suspended
nor
ever
quitted
their
hold
mr
barlow
then
placed
a
key
upon
the
table
and
putting
the
iron
near
it
the
key
attached
itself
as
firmly
to
the
bar
as
the
needles
had
done
before
all
this
appeared
so
surprising
to
tommy
that
he
begged
an
explanation
of
it
from
mr
barlow
that
gentleman
told
him
that
there
was
a
stone
often
found
in
iron
mines
that
was
called
the
this
stone
is
naturally
possessed
of
the
surprising
power
of
drawing
to
itself
all
pieces
of
iron
that
are
not
too
large
nor
placed
at
too
great
a
distance
but
what
is
equally
extraordinary
is
that
iron
itself
after
having
been
rubbed
upon
the
loadstone
acquires
the
same
virtue
as
the
stone
itself
of
attracting
other
iron
for
this
purpose
they
take
small
bars
of
iron
and
rub
them
carefully
upon
the
loadstone
and
when
they
have
acquired
this
very
extraordinary
power
they
call
them
when
harry
had
seen
the
exhibition
of
the
swan
upon
revolving
it
over
in
his
mind
he
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
performed
entirely
by
the
power
of
magnetism
upon
his
talking
to
me
about
the
affair
i
confirmed
him
in
his
opinion
and
furnished
him
with
a
small
magnet
to
put
into
the
bread
and
a
large
needle
to
conceal
in
the
body
of
the
bird
so
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
feat
which
so
much
puzzled
you
a
few
days
past
mr
barlow
had
scarcely
done
speaking
when
tommy
observed
another
curious
property
of
the
swan
which
he
had
not
found
out
before
this
bird
when
left
to
itself
constantly
rested
in
one
particular
direction
and
that
direction
was
full
north
and
south
tommy
inquired
the
reason
of
this
and
mr
barlow
gave
him
this
additional
explanation
the
persons
who
first
discovered
the
wonderful
powers
of
the
loadstone
in
communicating
its
virtues
to
iron
diverted
themselves
as
we
do
now
in
touching
needles
and
small
pieces
of
iron
which
they
made
to
float
upon
water
and
attracted
them
about
with
other
pieces
of
iron
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
found
out
as
you
do
now
another
surprising
property
of
this
wonderful
stone
they
observed
that
when
a
needle
had
once
been
touched
by
the
loadstone
if
it
was
left
to
float
upon
the
water
without
restraint
it
would
invariably
turn
itself
towards
the
north
in
a
short
time
they
improved
the
discovery
farther
and
contrived
to
suspend
the
middle
of
the
needle
upon
a
point
so
loosely
that
it
could
move
about
in
every
direction
this
they
covered
with
a
glass
case
and
by
this
means
they
always
had
it
in
their
power
to
find
out
all
the
quarters
of
the
heavens
and
earth
was
this
discovery
of
any
great
use
before
this
time
they
had
no
other
method
of
finding
their
way
along
the
sea
but
by
observing
the
stars
they
knew
by
experience
in
what
part
of
the
sky
certain
stars
appeared
at
every
season
of
the
year
and
this
enabled
them
to
discover
east
west
north
and
south
but
when
they
set
out
from
their
own
country
by
sea
they
knew
in
which
direction
the
place
was
situated
which
they
were
going
to
if
it
lay
to
the
east
they
had
only
to
keep
the
head
of
the
ship
turned
full
to
that
quarter
of
the
heavens
and
they
would
arrive
at
the
place
they
were
going
to
and
this
they
were
enabled
to
do
by
observing
the
stars
but
frequently
the
weather
was
thick
and
the
stars
no
longer
appeared
and
then
they
were
left
to
wander
about
the
pathless
ocean
without
the
smallest
track
to
guide
them
in
their
course
poor
people
they
must
be
in
a
dreadful
situation
indeed
tossed
about
on
such
an
immense
place
as
the
sea
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
night
and
not
able
even
to
guess
at
their
situation
for
this
reason
they
seldom
dared
to
venture
out
of
sight
of
the
shore
for
fear
of
losing
their
way
by
which
means
all
their
voyages
were
long
and
tedious
for
they
were
obliged
to
make
them
several
times
as
long
as
they
would
have
done
could
they
have
taken
the
straight
and
nearest
way
but
soon
after
the
discovery
of
this
admirable
property
of
the
loadstone
they
found
that
the
needle
which
had
been
thus
prepared
was
capable
of
showing
them
the
different
points
of
the
heavens
even
in
the
darkest
night
this
enabled
them
to
sail
with
greater
security
and
to
venture
boldly
upon
the
immense
ocean
which
they
had
always
feared
before
how
extraordinary
that
a
little
stone
should
enable
people
to
cross
the
sea
and
to
find
their
way
from
one
country
to
another
but
i
wonder
why
they
take
all
these
pains
that
you
need
not
wonder
at
when
you
consider
that
one
country
frequently
produces
what
another
does
not
and
therefore
by
exchanging
their
different
commodities
the
people
of
both
may
live
more
conveniently
than
they
did
before
but
does
not
almost
every
country
produce
all
that
is
necessary
to
support
the
inhabitants
of
it
and
therefore
they
might
live
i
should
think
even
though
they
received
nothing
from
any
other
country
so
might
your
father
live
perhaps
upon
the
productions
of
his
own
farm
but
he
sometimes
sells
his
cattle
to
purchase
clothes
sometimes
his
corn
to
purchase
cattle
then
he
frequently
exchanges
with
his
neighbours
one
kind
of
grain
for
another
and
thus
their
mutual
conveniency
is
better
promoted
than
if
each
were
to
confine
himself
to
the
produce
of
his
own
land
at
the
same
time
it
is
true
that
every
country
which
is
inhabited
by
men
contains
within
itself
all
that
is
necessary
for
their
subsistence
and
what
they
bring
from
other
countries
is
frequently
more
hurtful
than
salutary
to
them
i
have
heard
you
say
that
even
in
greenland
the
coldest
and
most
uncomfortable
country
in
the
world
the
inhabitants
procure
themselves
necessaries
and
live
contented
what
is
there
a
part
of
the
world
still
colder
than
lapland
greenland
is
still
farther
north
and
therefore
colder
and
more
barren
the
ground
is
there
covered
with
eternal
snows
which
never
melt
even
in
the
summer
there
are
scarcely
any
animals
to
be
found
excepting
bears
that
live
by
preying
upon
fish
there
are
no
trees
growing
upon
any
part
of
the
country
so
that
the
inhabitants
have
nothing
to
build
their
houses
with
excepting
the
planks
and
trees
which
the
sea
washes
away
from
other
countries
and
leaves
upon
their
coast
with
these
they
erect
large
cabins
where
several
families
live
together
the
sides
of
these
huts
are
composed
of
earth
and
stones
and
the
top
secured
with
turf
in
a
short
time
the
whole
is
so
cemented
with
frost
that
it
is
impenetrable
to
the
weather
during
the
whole
winter
along
the
sides
of
the
building
are
made
several
partitions
in
each
of
which
a
greenlander
lives
with
his
family
each
of
these
families
have
a
small
lamp
continually
burning
before
them
by
means
of
which
they
cook
their
food
and
light
themselves
and
what
is
equally
necessary
in
so
cold
a
country
keep
up
agreeable
warmth
throughout
their
apartment
they
have
a
few
deer
which
sometimes
visit
them
in
the
summer
and
which
the
greenlanders
kill
whenever
they
can
catch
them
but
they
are
almost
entirely
destitute
of
all
the
vegetables
which
serve
as
nourishment
to
man
so
that
they
are
obliged
to
be
continually
upon
the
sea
in
order
to
catch
fish
for
their
maintenance
what
a
dreadful
life
that
must
be
in
a
country
which
is
so
cold
in
consequence
of
that
extreme
cold
those
northern
seas
are
full
of
such
immense
quantities
of
ice
that
they
are
sometimes
almost
covered
with
them
huge
pieces
come
floating
down
which
are
not
only
as
big
as
the
largest
houses
but
even
resemble
small
mountains
these
are
sometimes
dashed
against
each
other
by
the
winds
with
such
immense
force
that
they
would
crush
the
strongest
ship
to
pieces
and
with
a
noise
that
exceeds
the
report
of
a
cannon
upon
these
pieces
of
ice
are
frequently
seen
white
bears
of
an
enormous
size
which
have
either
fallen
asleep
upon
them
and
so
been
carried
away
or
have
straggled
over
those
ice
hills
in
search
of
fish
and
is
it
possible
that
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
country
can
find
enough
in
it
for
all
their
necessities
the
necessities
of
life
are
very
few
and
are
therefore
to
be
found
even
in
the
most
rugged
climates
if
men
are
not
wanting
to
themselves
or
deficient
in
industry
in
plentiful
countries
like
this
and
in
most
of
the
more
temperate
climates
great
numbers
are
maintained
in
idleness
and
imagine
that
they
were
only
born
to
live
upon
the
labour
of
others
but
in
such
a
country
as
greenland
is
described
to
be
it
requires
continual
exertion
to
procure
the
simplest
support
of
human
life
and
therefore
no
one
can
live
at
all
who
will
not
employ
himself
in
the
same
manner
as
his
neighbours
you
said
that
these
people
had
neither
flesh
nor
corn
do
they
then
clothe
themselves
with
the
skins
of
fish
as
well
as
live
upon
them
there
is
in
those
seas
a
peculiar
species
of
animal
called
a
he
is
nine
or
ten
feet
long
and
has
two
small
feet
before
on
which
he
is
able
to
walk
a
little
upon
the
shore
for
he
frequently
comes
out
of
the
sea
and
sleeps
or
amuses
himself
upon
the
land
or
ice
his
body
is
very
large
and
full
of
oil
and
behind
he
has
two
legs
which
resemble
fins
with
which
he
swims
in
the
water
this
animal
is
the
constant
prey
of
the
greenlander
and
furnishes
him
with
all
he
wants
the
flesh
he
eats
the
fat
serves
him
to
feed
his
lamp
which
is
almost
as
necessary
as
food
itself
in
that
cold
climate
with
the
skin
he
makes
clothes
that
are
impenetrable
to
the
water
or
lines
the
inside
of
his
hut
to
keep
out
the
weather
as
this
animal
is
so
necessary
to
the
existence
of
a
greenlander
it
is
his
greatest
glory
to
chase
and
take
him
for
this
purpose
he
places
himself
in
a
small
narrow
boat
the
top
of
which
is
covered
over
with
the
skins
of
seals
and
closes
round
the
middle
of
the
fisher
so
tight
as
entirely
to
exclude
the
water
he
has
a
long
oar
or
paddle
broad
at
both
ends
which
he
dips
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
and
rows
along
with
incredible
swiftness
over
the
roughest
seas
he
carries
with
him
a
harpoon
which
is
a
kind
of
lance
or
javelin
tied
to
a
long
thong
at
the
end
of
which
is
fixed
a
bladder
or
some
other
light
thing
that
sinks
with
difficulty
when
the
fisherman
is
thus
prepared
he
skims
lightly
along
the
waters
till
he
perceives
at
a
distance
one
of
these
animals
floating
upon
the
surface
the
greenlander
then
approaches
him
as
softly
as
he
is
able
and
if
possible
contrives
that
the
animal
shall
have
the
wind
and
sun
in
his
eyes
when
he
is
sufficiently
near
he
throws
his
harpoon
and
generally
wounds
the
creature
in
which
case
he
instantly
hurries
away
and
carries
with
him
the
thong
and
bladder
but
it
is
not
long
before
he
is
compelled
to
rise
again
to
the
surface
of
the
water
to
breathe
and
then
the
greenlander
who
has
been
pursuing
him
all
the
time
attacks
him
anew
and
dispatches
him
with
a
shorter
lance
which
he
has
brought
with
him
for
that
purpose
he
then
ties
his
prey
to
his
boat
and
tows
it
after
him
to
his
family
who
receive
it
with
joy
and
dress
it
for
their
supper
although
these
poor
people
live
a
life
of
such
continual
fatigue
and
are
obliged
to
earn
their
food
with
so
much
hardship
they
are
generous
and
hospitable
in
the
management
of
it
for
there
is
not
a
person
present
but
is
invited
to
partake
of
the
feast
and
a
greenlander
would
think
himself
dishonoured
for
life
if
he
should
be
thought
capable
of
wishing
to
keep
it
all
to
himself
i
think
it
seems
as
if
the
less
people
had
the
more
generous
they
are
with
it
that
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
and
should
be
a
lesson
to
many
of
our
rich
at
home
who
imagine
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
fortune
but
to
throw
it
away
upon
their
pleasures
while
there
are
so
many
thousands
in
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
but
pray
sir
have
you
no
more
particulars
to
tell
me
about
these
greenlanders
for
i
think
it
is
the
most
curious
account
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
there
is
another
very
curious
particular
indeed
to
be
mentioned
of
these
countries
in
these
seas
is
found
the
largest
animal
in
the
world
an
immense
fish
which
is
called
the
whale
oh
dear
i
have
heard
of
that
extraordinary
animal
and
pray
sir
do
the
greenlanders
ever
catch
them
the
whale
is
of
such
a
prodigious
size
that
he
sometimes
reaches
seventy
or
eighty
or
even
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
length
he
is
from
ten
to
above
twenty
feet
in
height
and
every
way
large
in
proportion
when
he
swims
along
the
seas
he
appears
rather
like
a
large
vessel
floating
upon
the
waters
than
a
fish
he
has
two
holes
in
his
head
through
which
he
blows
out
water
to
a
great
height
in
the
air
immense
fins
and
a
tail
with
which
he
almost
raises
a
tempest
when
he
lashes
the
sea
with
it
would
you
not
believe
that
such
an
animal
was
the
most
dreadful
of
the
whole
brute
creation
indeed
sir
i
should
i
should
think
that
such
a
fish
would
overset
whole
ships
and
devour
the
sailors
far
from
it
it
is
one
of
the
most
innocent
in
respect
to
man
that
the
ocean
produces
nor
does
he
ever
do
him
the
least
hurt
unless
by
accidentally
overturning
vessels
with
his
enormous
bulk
the
food
he
lives
upon
is
chiefly
small
fish
and
particularly
herrings
these
fish
are
bred
in
such
prodigious
shoals
amid
the
ice
of
those
northern
climates
that
the
sea
is
absolutely
covered
with
them
for
miles
together
then
it
is
that
the
hungry
whale
pursues
them
and
thins
their
numbers
by
swallowing
thousands
of
them
in
their
course
what
numbers
indeed
must
such
a
prodigious
fish
devour
of
these
small
animals
the
whale
in
his
turn
falls
a
prey
to
the
cruelty
and
avarice
of
man
some
indeed
are
caught
by
the
greenlanders
who
have
a
sufficient
excuse
for
persecuting
him
with
continual
attacks
in
their
total
want
of
vegetables
and
every
species
of
food
which
the
earth
affords
but
the
europeans
who
are
too
nice
and
squeamish
to
eat
his
flesh
send
out
great
numbers
of
ships
every
year
to
destroy
the
poor
whale
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
oil
which
his
body
contains
and
the
elastic
bones
which
are
known
by
the
name
of
whalebone
and
applied
to
several
purposes
when
those
who
go
upon
this
dangerous
expedition
discern
a
whale
floating
at
a
distance
they
instantly
send
out
a
large
boat
to
pursue
him
some
of
the
men
row
along
as
gently
as
possible
while
the
person
that
is
appointed
to
attack
the
fish
stands
upon
the
forepart
of
the
boat
holding
in
his
hand
a
sharp
harpoon
with
which
he
is
prepared
to
wound
his
prey
this
is
fastened
to
a
long
cord
which
lies
ready
coiled
up
in
the
boat
so
that
they
may
let
it
out
in
an
instant
when
the
fish
is
struck
for
such
is
his
prodigious
force
that
should
the
least
impediment
occur
to
stop
the
rope
in
its
passage
he
would
instantly
draw
the
boat
after
him
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
order
to
prevent
these
dangerous
accidents
a
man
stands
constantly
ready
to
divide
the
rope
with
a
hatchet
in
case
it
should
happen
to
tangle
and
another
is
continually
pouring
water
over
it
for
fear
the
swiftness
of
the
motion
should
make
it
take
fire
the
poor
whale
being
thus
wounded
darts
away
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
generally
plunges
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
men
have
a
prodigious
quantity
of
cord
ready
to
let
out
and
when
their
store
is
exhausted
there
are
generally
other
boats
ready
to
supply
more
thus
is
the
poor
animal
overpowered
and
killed
in
spite
of
his
immense
bulk
and
irresistible
strength
for
gradually
wearied
with
his
own
efforts
and
the
loss
of
blood
he
soon
relaxes
in
his
speed
and
rises
again
to
the
top
of
the
water
then
it
is
that
the
fishers
who
have
pursued
him
all
the
time
with
the
hopes
of
such
an
opportunity
approach
him
anew
and
attack
him
with
fresh
harpoons
till
in
the
end
his
strength
is
entirely
exhausted
the
waves
themselves
are
tinged
with
a
bloody
colour
from
his
innumerable
wounds
and
he
writhes
himself
about
in
strong
convulsions
and
unutterable
pain
then
the
conflict
is
soon
at
an
end
in
a
short
time
he
breathes
his
last
and
turning
upon
his
back
floats
like
some
large
vessel
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
fishers
then
approach
and
cut
off
the
fins
and
other
valuable
parts
which
they
stow
on
board
their
ships
the
fat
or
blubber
as
it
is
often
called
is
received
into
large
hogsheads
and
when
boiled
to
purify
it
composes
the
common
oil
which
is
applied
to
so
many
useful
purposes
the
remains
of
this
vast
body
are
left
a
prey
to
other
fish
and
to
the
greenlanders
who
carefully
collect
every
fragment
which
they
can
find
and
apply
it
to
their
own
use
sometimes
they
go
to
pursue
the
whale
themselves
but
when
they
do
it
is
in
large
numbers
and
they
attack
him
nearly
in
the
same
manner
as
the
europeans
do
only
as
they
are
not
so
well
supplied
with
cord
they
fix
the
skins
of
seals
which
they
have
inflated
with
air
to
the
end
of
the
thongs
which
are
tied
to
their
harpoons
and
this
serves
both
to
weary
out
the
fish
who
drags
them
with
him
under
the
water
and
to
discover
him
the
instant
he
approaches
to
the
surface
i
can
not
help
pitying
the
poor
whale
that
is
thus
persecuted
for
the
sake
of
his
spoils
why
can
not
man
let
this
poor
beast
live
unmolested
in
the
midst
of
the
snows
and
ice
in
which
he
was
born
you
ought
to
know
enough
of
the
world
to
be
sensible
that
the
desire
of
gain
will
tempt
men
upon
every
expedition
however
in
this
case
you
must
consider
that
the
whale
himself
is
continually
supported
by
murdering
thousands
of
herrings
and
other
small
fish
so
that
were
they
possessed
of
reason
they
would
welcome
the
europeans
who
came
to
destroy
their
enemies
as
friends
and
benefactors
but
pray
sir
how
do
the
little
boys
amuse
themselves
in
such
a
dismal
country
do
their
fathers
take
them
out
with
them
when
the
men
come
home
all
covered
with
wet
and
icicles
and
sit
down
comfortably
in
their
huts
to
feast
upon
the
prey
their
common
conversation
is
about
the
dangers
and
accidents
they
have
met
with
in
their
expedition
a
greenlander
relates
how
he
bounded
over
the
waves
to
surprise
the
monstrous
seal
how
he
pierced
the
animal
with
his
harpoon
who
had
nearly
dragged
the
boat
with
him
under
the
water
how
he
attacked
him
again
in
closer
combat
how
the
beast
enraged
with
his
wounds
rushed
upon
him
in
order
to
destroy
him
with
his
teeth
and
how
in
the
end
by
courage
and
perseverance
he
triumphed
over
his
adversary
and
brought
it
safe
to
land
all
this
will
he
relate
with
the
vehemence
and
interest
which
people
naturally
feel
for
things
which
concern
them
nearly
he
stands
in
the
midst
of
his
countrymen
and
describes
every
minute
circumstance
of
his
adventures
the
little
children
gather
round
and
greedily
catch
the
relation
they
feel
themselves
interested
in
every
circumstance
they
hear
and
wish
to
share
in
the
toils
and
glory
of
their
fathers
when
they
are
a
little
bigger
they
exercise
themselves
in
small
skiffs
with
which
they
learn
to
overcome
the
waves
nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
or
require
greater
dexterity
than
the
management
of
a
greenlander
boat
the
least
thing
will
overset
it
and
then
the
man
who
can
not
disengage
himself
from
the
boat
which
is
fastened
to
his
middle
sinks
down
below
the
waves
and
is
inevitably
drowned
if
he
can
not
regain
his
balance
the
only
hope
of
doing
this
is
placed
in
the
proper
application
of
his
oar
and
therefore
the
dexterous
management
of
this
implement
forms
the
early
study
of
the
young
greenlanders
in
their
sportive
parties
they
row
about
in
a
thousand
different
manners
they
dive
under
their
boats
and
then
set
them
to
rights
with
their
paddle
they
learn
to
glide
over
the
roughest
billows
and
face
the
greatest
dangers
with
intrepidity
till
in
the
end
they
acquire
sufficient
strength
and
address
to
fish
for
themselves
and
to
be
admitted
into
the
class
of
men
pray
sir
is
this
the
country
where
men
travel
about
upon
sledges
that
are
drawn
by
dogs
upon
sledges
drawn
by
dogs
that
must
be
droll
indeed
i
had
no
idea
that
dogs
could
ever
draw
carriages
the
country
you
are
speaking
of
is
called
kamtschatka
it
is
indeed
a
cold
and
dreary
country
but
very
distant
from
greenland
the
inhabitants
there
train
up
large
dogs
which
they
harness
to
a
sledge
upon
which
the
master
sits
and
so
performs
his
journey
along
the
snow
and
ice
all
the
summer
the
kamtschatkans
turn
their
dogs
loose
to
shift
for
themselves
and
prey
upon
the
remains
of
fish
which
they
find
upon
the
shore
or
the
banks
of
the
rivers
for
fish
is
the
common
food
of
all
the
inhabitants
in
the
winter
they
assemble
their
dogs
and
use
them
for
the
purposes
i
have
mentioned
they
have
no
reins
to
govern
the
dogs
or
stop
them
in
their
course
but
the
driver
sits
upon
his
sledge
and
keeps
himself
as
steady
as
he
is
able
holding
in
his
hand
a
short
stick
which
he
throws
at
the
dogs
if
they
displease
him
and
catches
again
with
great
dexterity
as
he
passes
this
way
of
travelling
is
not
without
danger
for
the
temper
of
the
dogs
is
such
that
when
they
descend
hills
and
slippery
places
and
pass
through
woods
where
the
driver
is
exposed
to
wound
himself
with
the
branches
and
stumps
they
always
quicken
their
pace
the
same
is
observed
in
case
their
master
should
fall
off
which
they
instantly
discover
by
the
sudden
lightness
of
the
carriage
for
then
they
set
off
at
such
a
rate
that
it
is
difficult
to
overtake
them
the
only
way
which
the
kamtschatcan
finds
is
to
throw
himself
at
his
length
upon
the
ground
and
lay
hold
on
the
empty
sledge
suffering
himself
to
be
thus
dragged
along
the
earth
till
the
dogs
through
weariness
abate
their
speed
frequently
in
their
journeys
these
travellers
are
surprised
by
unexpected
storms
of
wind
and
snow
which
render
it
impracticable
to
proceed
farther
how
ill
would
an
european
fare
to
be
thus
abandoned
at
the
distance
perhaps
of
a
hundred
miles
or
more
from
any
habitable
place
exposed
without
shelter
in
the
midst
of
extensive
plains
and
unable
to
procure
either
wood
or
fire
but
the
hardy
native
of
these
cold
climates
inured
from
his
infancy
to
support
difficulties
and
almost
superior
to
the
elements
seeks
the
shelter
of
the
first
forest
he
can
find
then
wrapping
himself
round
in
his
warm
fur
garment
he
sits
with
his
legs
under
him
and
thus
bundled
up
suffers
himself
to
be
covered
round
with
snow
except
a
small
hole
which
he
leaves
for
the
convenience
of
breathing
in
this
manner
he
lies
with
his
dogs
around
him
who
assist
in
keeping
him
warm
sometimes
for
several
days
till
the
storm
is
past
and
the
roads
again
become
passable
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
pursue
his
journey
again
illustration
frequently
in
their
journeys
these
travellers
are
surprised
by
unexpected
storms
of
wind
and
snow
which
render
it
impracticable
to
proceed
farther
i
could
not
have
conceived
it
possible
that
men
should
be
able
to
struggle
with
so
many
hardships
but
do
not
the
poor
people
who
inhabit
these
cold
climates
quit
them
whenever
they
can
find
an
opportunity
and
come
to
settle
in
those
that
are
warmer
not
in
the
least
when
they
hear
that
there
are
no
seals
to
be
caught
in
other
countries
they
say
that
they
must
be
wretched
indeed
and
much
inferior
to
their
own
besides
they
have
in
general
so
great
a
contempt
for
all
europeans
that
they
have
no
inclination
to
visit
the
countries
which
they
inhabit
how
can
that
be
how
can
a
parcel
of
wretched
ignorant
savages
despise
men
that
are
so
much
superior
to
themselves
this
is
not
what
they
are
quite
so
well
convinced
of
the
greenlanders
for
instance
see
that
the
europeans
who
visit
them
are
much
inferior
to
themselves
in
the
art
of
managing
a
boat
or
catching
seals
in
short
in
everything
which
they
find
most
useful
to
support
life
for
this
reason
they
consider
them
all
with
very
great
contempt
and
look
upon
them
as
little
better
than
barbarians
that
is
very
impertinent
indeed
and
i
should
like
to
convince
them
of
their
folly
why
do
not
you
look
upon
yourself
as
much
superior
to
your
black
servants
and
have
i
not
often
heard
you
express
great
contempt
for
them
i
do
not
despise
them
now
so
much
as
i
used
to
do
besides
sir
i
only
think
myself
something
better
because
i
have
been
brought
up
like
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
i
have
never
exactly
understood
what
a
gentleman
is
according
to
your
notions
why
sir
when
a
person
is
not
brought
up
to
work
and
has
several
people
to
wait
upon
him
like
my
father
and
mother
then
he
is
a
gentleman
and
then
he
has
a
right
to
despise
others
has
he
i
do
not
say
that
sir
neither
but
he
is
however
superior
to
them
superior
in
what
in
the
art
of
cultivating
the
ground
to
raise
food
and
making
clothes
or
houses
no
sir
not
that
for
gentlemen
never
plough
the
ground
or
build
houses
is
he
then
superior
in
knowledge
were
you
who
have
been
brought
up
a
gentleman
superior
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
when
you
came
here
to
be
sure
sir
when
i
came
here
i
did
not
know
so
much
as
i
do
now
if
then
you
when
you
knew
nothing
and
could
do
nothing
thought
yourself
superior
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
why
should
you
wonder
that
men
who
really
excel
others
in
those
things
which
they
see
absolutely
necessary
should
have
the
same
good
opinion
of
themselves
were
you
to
be
in
greenland
for
instance
how
would
you
prove
your
own
superiority
and
importance
i
would
tell
them
that
i
had
always
been
well
brought
up
at
home
that
they
would
not
believe
they
would
say
that
they
saw
you
were
totally
unable
to
do
anything
useful
to
guide
a
boat
to
swim
the
seas
to
procure
yourself
the
least
sustenance
so
that
you
would
perish
with
hunger
if
they
did
not
charitably
afford
you
now
and
then
a
bit
of
whale
or
seal
and
as
to
your
being
a
gentleman
they
would
not
understand
the
word
nor
would
they
comprehend
why
one
man
who
is
naturally
as
good
as
his
should
submit
to
the
caprice
of
another
and
obey
him
indeed
sir
i
begin
to
think
that
i
am
not
so
much
better
than
others
as
i
used
to
do
the
more
you
encourage
that
thought
the
more
likely
you
are
to
acquire
real
superiority
and
excellence
for
great
and
generous
minds
are
less
exposed
to
that
ridiculous
vanity
than
weak
and
childish
ones
a
few
evenings
after
this
conversation
when
the
night
was
remarkably
clear
mr
barlow
called
his
two
pupils
into
the
garden
where
there
was
a
long
hollow
tube
suspended
upon
a
frame
mr
barlow
then
placed
tommy
upon
a
chair
and
bade
him
look
through
it
which
he
had
scarcely
done
when
he
cried
out
what
an
extraordinary
sight
is
this
what
is
the
matter
said
mr
barlow
i
see
replied
tommy
what
i
should
take
for
the
moon
were
it
not
a
great
many
times
bigger
and
so
near
to
me
that
i
can
almost
touch
it
what
you
see
answered
mr
barlow
smiling
is
the
moon
itself
this
glass
has
indeed
the
power
of
making
it
appear
to
your
eye
as
it
would
do
could
you
approach
a
great
deal
nearer
but
still
it
is
nothing
but
the
moon
and
from
this
single
experiment
you
may
judge
of
the
different
size
which
the
sun
and
all
the
other
heavenly
bodies
would
appear
to
have
if
you
could
advance
a
great
deal
nearer
to
them
tommy
was
delighted
with
this
new
spectacle
the
moon
he
said
viewed
in
this
manner
was
the
most
glorious
sight
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
and
i
protest
added
he
it
seems
to
be
shaded
in
such
a
manner
that
it
almost
resembles
land
and
water
what
you
say
answered
mr
barlow
is
by
no
means
unreasonable
the
moon
is
a
very
large
body
and
may
be
for
ought
we
know
inhabited
like
the
earth
tommy
was
more
and
more
astonished
at
the
introduction
of
all
these
new
ideas
but
what
he
was
particularly
inquisitive
about
was
to
know
the
reason
of
this
extraordinary
change
in
the
appearance
of
objects
only
by
looking
through
a
hollow
tube
with
a
bit
of
glass
fixed
into
it
all
this
replied
mr
barlow
i
will
if
you
desire
it
one
day
explain
to
you
but
it
is
rather
too
long
and
difficult
to
undertake
it
at
the
present
moment
when
you
are
a
little
farther
advanced
in
some
of
the
things
which
you
are
now
studying
you
will
comprehend
me
better
however
before
we
retire
i
will
show
you
something
more
which
will
perhaps
equally
surprise
you
they
then
returned
to
the
house
and
mr
barlow
who
had
prepared
everything
for
his
intended
exhibition
led
tommy
into
a
room
where
he
observed
nothing
but
a
lantern
upon
the
floor
and
a
white
sheet
hung
up
against
the
wall
tommy
laughed
and
said
he
did
not
see
anything
very
curious
in
all
that
well
said
mr
barlow
perhaps
i
may
surprise
you
yet
before
i
have
done
let
us
at
least
light
up
the
lantern
that
you
may
see
a
little
clearer
mr
barlow
then
lighted
a
lamp
which
was
within
the
lantern
and
extinguished
all
the
other
candles
and
tommy
was
instantly
struck
with
astonishment
to
see
a
gigantic
figure
of
a
man
leading
along
a
large
bear
appear
upon
the
wall
and
glide
slowly
along
the
sheet
as
he
was
admiring
this
wonderful
sight
a
large
monkey
dressed
up
in
the
habit
of
a
man
appeared
and
followed
the
bear
after
him
came
an
old
woman
trundling
a
barrow
of
fruit
and
then
two
boys
who
however
were
as
big
as
men
that
seemed
to
be
fighting
as
they
passed
tommy
could
hardly
find
words
to
express
his
pleasure
and
admiration
and
he
entreated
mr
barlow
in
the
most
earnest
manner
to
explain
to
him
the
reason
of
all
these
wonderful
sights
at
present
said
mr
barlow
you
are
not
sufficiently
advanced
to
comprehend
the
explanation
however
thus
much
i
will
inform
you
that
both
the
wonderful
tube
which
showed
you
the
moon
so
much
larger
than
you
ever
saw
it
before
and
this
curious
exhibition
of
and
a
variety
of
others
which
i
will
hereafter
show
you
if
you
desire
it
depend
entirely
upon
such
a
little
bit
of
glass
as
this
mr
barlow
then
put
into
his
hand
a
small
round
piece
of
glass
which
resembled
the
figure
of
a
globe
on
both
sides
it
is
by
looking
through
such
pieces
of
glass
as
this
said
he
and
by
arranging
them
in
a
particular
manner
that
we
are
enabled
to
perform
all
these
wonders
well
said
tommy
i
never
could
have
believed
that
simply
looking
through
a
bit
of
glass
could
have
made
such
a
difference
in
the
appearance
of
things
and
yet
said
mr
barlow
looking
at
a
thing
through
water
alone
is
capable
of
producing
the
greatest
change
as
i
will
immediately
prove
to
you
mr
barlow
then
took
a
small
earthen
basin
and
putting
a
at
the
bottom
desired
tommy
gradually
to
go
back
still
looking
at
the
basin
till
he
could
distinguish
the
piece
of
money
no
longer
tommy
accordingly
retired
and
presently
cried
out
that
he
had
totally
lost
sight
of
the
money
then
said
mr
barlow
i
will
enable
you
to
see
it
merely
by
putting
water
into
it
so
he
gradually
poured
water
into
the
basin
till
to
the
new
astonishment
of
tommy
he
found
that
he
could
plainly
see
the
which
was
before
invisible
tommy
was
wonderfully
delighted
with
all
these
experiments
and
declared
that
from
this
day
forward
he
would
never
rest
till
he
had
made
himself
acquainted
with
everything
curious
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
i
remember
reading
a
story
said
mr
barlow
where
a
telescope
for
that
is
the
name
of
the
glass
which
brings
distant
objects
so
much
nearer
to
the
eye
was
used
to
a
very
excellent
purpose
indeed
pray
how
was
that
said
tommy
in
some
part
of
africa
said
mr
barlow
there
was
a
prince
who
was
attacked
by
one
of
his
most
powerful
neighbours
and
almost
driven
out
of
his
dominions
he
had
done
everything
he
could
do
to
defend
himself
with
the
greatest
bravery
but
was
overpowered
by
the
numbers
of
his
enemy
and
defeated
in
several
battles
at
length
he
was
reduced
to
a
very
small
number
of
brave
men
who
still
accompanied
him
and
had
taken
possession
of
a
steep
and
difficult
hill
which
he
determined
to
defend
to
the
last
extremity
while
the
enemy
was
in
possession
of
all
the
country
round
while
he
lay
with
his
little
army
in
this
disagreeable
situation
he
was
visited
by
a
european
whom
he
had
formerly
received
and
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
to
this
man
the
unfortunate
prince
made
his
complaints
telling
him
that
he
was
exposed
every
instant
to
be
attacked
by
his
stronger
foe
and
though
he
had
taken
his
resolution
he
expected
nothing
but
to
be
cut
off
with
all
his
army
the
european
happened
to
have
with
him
one
of
these
curious
glasses
which
had
not
long
been
invented
in
europe
and
was
totally
unknown
in
that
part
of
the
globe
and
he
told
the
prince
his
friend
that
he
would
soon
inform
him
of
what
his
enemy
was
doing
and
then
he
might
take
his
own
measures
with
the
greater
confidence
so
he
produced
his
glass
and
after
having
adjusted
it
turned
it
towards
the
enemy
camp
which
he
observed
some
time
with
great
attention
and
then
told
his
friend
that
he
might
at
least
be
easy
for
the
present
for
the
general
was
at
that
instant
thinking
only
of
a
great
feast
which
he
was
giving
to
the
officers
of
his
army
is
it
possible
replied
the
prince
you
can
pretend
to
discover
so
accurately
what
is
done
in
yonder
camp
my
eyes
i
think
are
at
least
as
good
as
yours
and
yet
the
distance
is
so
great
that
i
can
discover
nothing
distinctly
the
european
then
desired
his
friend
to
look
through
the
telescope
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
than
he
rose
in
great
trepidation
and
was
going
to
mount
his
horse
for
the
spectacle
was
so
new
to
him
that
he
imagined
the
enemy
was
close
to
him
and
that
nothing
remained
but
to
stand
upon
his
defence
the
european
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
mistake
and
after
he
had
with
some
difficulty
removed
his
panic
by
explaining
the
wonderful
powers
of
the
glass
he
prevailed
upon
him
to
be
quiet
but
the
unexpected
terror
which
this
telescope
had
excited
inspired
him
with
a
sudden
thought
which
he
determined
to
improve
to
the
advantage
of
the
besieged
prince
acquainting
him
therefore
with
his
intention
he
desired
him
to
draw
out
all
his
men
in
their
military
array
and
to
let
them
descend
the
mountain
slowly
clashing
their
arms
and
waving
their
swords
as
they
marched
he
then
mounted
a
horse
and
rode
to
the
camp
where
he
no
sooner
arrived
than
he
desired
to
be
instantly
introduced
to
the
general
he
found
him
sitting
in
his
tent
carousing
in
the
midst
of
his
officers
and
not
at
all
thinking
of
an
engagement
when
he
approached
he
thus
accosted
him
am
come
great
warrior
as
a
friend
to
acquaint
you
with
a
circumstance
that
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
safety
of
yourself
and
army
is
that
said
the
general
with
some
surprise
this
instant
replied
the
european
you
are
indulging
yourself
in
festivity
the
enemy
who
has
lately
been
reinforced
with
a
large
body
of
his
most
valiant
troops
is
advancing
to
attack
you
and
even
now
has
almost
penetrated
to
your
camp
have
here
added
he
wonderful
glass
the
composition
of
which
is
only
known
in
europe
and
if
you
will
condescend
to
look
through
it
for
a
moment
it
will
convince
you
that
all
i
say
is
truth
saying
this
he
directed
his
eye
to
the
telescope
which
the
general
had
no
sooner
looked
into
than
he
was
struck
with
consternation
and
affright
he
saw
the
prince
whom
he
had
long
considered
as
lying
at
his
mercy
advancing
with
his
army
in
excellent
order
and
as
he
imagined
close
to
his
camp
he
could
even
discern
the
menacing
air
of
the
soldiers
and
the
brandishing
of
their
swords
as
they
moved
his
officers
who
thronged
round
him
to
know
the
cause
of
his
sudden
fright
had
no
sooner
peeped
into
the
wonderful
glass
than
they
were
all
affected
in
the
same
manner
their
heads
had
been
already
disturbed
by
their
intemperance
and
therefore
without
waiting
to
consult
they
rushed
in
a
panic
out
of
their
tents
mounted
their
swiftest
horses
and
fled
away
without
staying
to
see
the
consequences
the
rest
of
the
army
who
had
seen
the
consternation
of
their
leaders
and
had
heard
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
to
destroy
them
were
struck
with
an
equal
panic
and
instantly
followed
the
example
so
that
the
whole
plain
was
covered
with
men
and
horses
that
made
all
possible
haste
towards
their
own
country
without
thinking
of
resistance
thus
was
an
immense
army
dispersed
in
an
instant
and
the
besieged
prince
delivered
from
his
danger
by
the
address
and
superior
knowledge
of
a
single
man
thus
you
see
added
mr
barlow
of
how
much
use
a
superiority
of
knowledge
is
frequently
capable
of
making
individuals
but
a
still
more
famous
instance
is
that
of
archimedes
one
of
the
most
celebrated
mathematicians
of
his
time
he
when
the
city
of
syracuse
was
besieged
by
the
romans
defended
it
for
a
long
time
by
the
surprising
machines
he
invented
in
such
a
manner
that
they
began
to
despair
of
taking
it
do
pray
said
tommy
tell
me
that
story
no
answered
mr
barlow
it
is
now
time
to
retire
and
you
may
at
any
time
read
the
particulars
of
this
extraordinary
siege
in
life
of
marcellus
and
now
the
time
approached
when
mr
barlow
was
accustomed
to
invite
greater
part
of
the
poor
of
his
parish
to
an
annual
dinner
he
had
a
large
hall
which
was
almost
filled
with
men
women
and
children
a
cheerful
fire
blazed
in
the
chimney
and
a
prodigious
table
was
placed
in
the
middle
for
the
company
to
dine
upon
mr
barlow
himself
received
his
guests
and
conversed
with
them
about
the
state
of
their
families
and
their
affairs
those
that
were
industrious
and
brought
their
children
up
to
labour
instructing
them
in
the
knowledge
of
their
duty
and
preserving
them
from
bad
impressions
were
sure
to
meet
with
his
encouragement
and
commendations
those
that
had
been
ill
he
assisted
with
such
little
necessaries
as
tended
to
alleviate
their
pains
and
diffuse
a
gleam
of
cheerfulness
over
their
sufferings
how
hard
he
would
say
is
the
lot
of
the
poor
when
they
are
afflicted
with
sickness
how
intolerable
do
find
the
least
bodily
disorder
even
though
we
possess
every
convenience
that
can
mitigate
its
violence
not
all
the
dainties
which
can
be
collected
from
all
the
elements
the
warmth
of
downy
beds
and
silken
couches
the
attendance
of
obsequious
dependants
are
capable
of
making
us
bear
with
common
patience
the
most
common
disease
how
pitiable
then
must
be
the
state
of
a
who
is
at
once
tortured
by
bodily
suffering
and
destitute
of
every
circumstance
which
can
alleviate
it
who
sees
around
him
a
family
that
are
not
only
incapable
of
assisting
their
parents
but
destined
to
want
the
common
necessaries
of
life
the
moment
he
intermits
his
daily
labours
how
indispensable
then
is
the
obligation
which
should
continually
impel
the
rich
to
exert
themselves
in
assisting
their
and
rendering
that
condition
of
life
which
we
all
avoid
less
dreadful
to
those
who
must
support
it
always
acting
from
such
principles
as
these
mr
barlow
was
the
common
friend
of
all
the
species
whatever
his
fortune
would
allow
him
to
perform
he
never
refused
to
all
who
stood
in
need
of
his
assistance
but
there
is
yet
a
duty
which
he
thought
of
more
importance
than
the
mere
distribution
of
property
to
the
needy
the
encouragement
of
industry
and
virtue
among
the
poor
and
giving
them
juster
notions
of
morals
and
religion
if
we
have
a
dog
he
would
say
we
refuse
neither
pains
nor
expense
to
train
him
up
to
hunting
if
we
have
a
horse
we
send
him
to
an
experienced
rider
to
be
bitted
but
our
own
species
seems
to
be
the
only
animal
which
is
entirely
exempted
from
our
care
when
he
rode
about
the
country
he
used
to
consider
with
admiration
the
splendid
stables
which
the
great
construct
for
the
reception
of
their
horses
their
temples
hermitages
grottoes
and
all
the
apparatus
of
modern
vanity
all
this
he
would
say
is
an
unequivocal
proof
the
gentleman
loves
himself
and
grudges
no
expense
that
can
gratify
his
vanity
but
i
would
now
wish
to
see
what
he
has
done
for
his
what
are
the
proofs
that
he
has
given
of
public
spirit
or
humanity
the
wrongs
which
he
has
redressed
the
miseries
he
has
alleviated
the
abuses
which
he
has
endeavoured
to
remove
when
he
was
told
of
the
stubbornness
and
ingratitude
of
the
poor
he
used
to
say
that
he
believed
it
without
difficulty
for
they
were
men
in
common
with
their
superiors
and
therefore
must
share
in
some
of
their
vices
but
if
the
interests
of
humanity
were
half
so
dear
to
us
as
the
smallest
article
that
pleases
our
palate
or
flatters
our
vanity
we
should
not
so
easily
abandon
them
in
disgust
mr
barlow
happened
once
to
be
in
company
with
a
lady
with
whom
he
was
upon
a
footing
of
intimacy
who
was
talking
in
this
manner
nobody
she
said
had
greater
feeling
than
herself
or
was
more
desirous
of
assisting
her
when
she
first
came
into
the
country
she
had
endeavoured
to
relieve
all
the
misery
she
heard
of
she
had
given
victuals
to
one
physic
to
a
second
and
clothes
to
a
third
but
she
had
met
with
such
and
ingratitude
in
return
that
she
had
long
been
obliged
to
resign
all
her
charitable
intentions
and
abandon
the
poor
to
their
fate
all
the
company
assented
to
a
doctrine
that
was
so
very
conformable
to
their
own
practice
and
inclinations
and
agreed
that
nothing
could
be
more
injudicious
than
any
attempts
to
be
charitable
some
little
time
after
this
conversation
cards
were
produced
and
the
lady
who
had
been
so
eloquent
against
the
poor
sat
down
to
whist
at
which
she
played
for
several
hours
with
equal
ignorance
and
when
the
party
was
over
she
was
complaining
to
mr
barlow
of
her
losses
and
added
that
she
scarcely
ever
in
her
life
had
sat
down
to
cards
with
better
success
i
wonder
madam
replied
mr
barlow
you
do
not
then
give
up
entirely
alas
answered
the
lady
i
have
often
made
this
resolution
but
i
never
had
the
courage
to
keep
it
indeed
madam
said
mr
barlow
it
is
impossible
you
can
be
deficient
in
courage
and
therefore
you
wrong
your
own
character
you
do
me
too
much
honour
said
the
lady
by
your
good
opinion
but
whoever
has
given
you
this
information
is
deceived
i
had
it
only
from
yourself
madam
from
me
sir
when
did
i
ever
give
you
such
a
character
of
myself
just
now
madam
when
you
declared
that
upon
the
bad
success
of
experiments
you
had
resolved
never
more
to
be
charitable
and
had
kept
the
resolution
ever
since
i
can
hardly
conceive
that
your
love
of
cards
is
so
much
greater
than
that
of
your
duty
and
religion
and
therefore
my
dear
madam
i
must
repeat
it
that
you
certainly
undervalue
your
own
fortitude
such
were
the
opinions
of
mr
barlow
in
respect
to
the
poor
and
therefore
instead
of
widening
the
distance
which
fortune
has
placed
between
one
part
of
mankind
and
another
he
was
continually
intent
upon
bringing
the
two
classes
nearer
together
poverty
has
in
itself
so
many
hardships
and
disagreeable
circumstances
that
we
need
not
increase
their
number
by
unnecessary
pride
and
insolence
the
distinctions
of
rank
may
indeed
be
necessary
to
the
government
of
a
populous
country
but
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
whole
not
of
individuals
that
they
can
have
any
just
claim
to
be
admitted
and
therefore
a
good
man
will
insist
upon
them
no
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
that
purpose
on
the
contrary
whatever
may
he
his
rank
or
importance
he
will
plainly
prove
by
the
courtesy
and
benevolence
of
his
manners
that
he
laments
the
necessity
of
his
own
elevation
and
instead
of
wishing
to
mount
still
higher
would
willingly
descend
nearer
to
an
equality
with
his
tommy
was
very
much
diverted
with
the
ceremonies
of
this
festal
day
he
had
lost
a
great
part
of
his
west
indian
pride
during
his
residence
with
mr
barlow
and
had
contracted
many
acquaintances
among
the
families
of
the
poor
after
the
example
of
mr
barlow
he
condescended
to
go
about
from
one
to
the
other
and
make
inquiries
about
their
families
nor
was
he
a
little
gratified
with
the
extreme
respect
with
which
he
found
himself
treated
both
on
the
account
of
mr
barlow
and
the
reputation
of
his
own
liberality
thus
did
the
morning
pass
away
in
the
most
agreeable
and
auspicious
manner
but
after
dinner
an
unexpected
incident
occurred
which
clouded
all
the
merriment
of
the
unfortunate
tommy
merton
mr
barlow
happened
to
have
a
large
newfoundland
dog
equally
famous
for
his
and
his
love
of
the
water
with
this
dog
tommy
had
been
long
forming
an
acquaintance
and
he
used
to
divert
himself
with
throwing
sticks
into
the
water
which
cæsar
would
instantly
bring
out
in
his
mouth
however
great
might
be
the
distance
tommy
had
been
fired
with
the
description
of
the
kamtschatkan
dogs
and
their
method
of
drawing
sledges
and
meditated
an
enterprise
of
this
nature
on
cæsar
this
very
day
finding
himself
unusually
at
leisure
he
chose
for
the
execution
of
his
project
he
therefore
furnished
himself
with
some
rope
and
a
kitchen
chair
which
he
destined
for
his
vehicle
instead
of
a
sledge
he
then
inveigled
cæsar
into
a
large
yard
behind
the
house
and
extending
the
chair
flat
upon
the
ground
fastened
him
to
it
with
great
care
and
ingenuity
cæsar
who
did
not
understand
the
new
purpose
to
which
he
was
going
to
be
applied
suffered
himself
to
be
harnessed
without
opposition
and
tommy
mounted
triumphantly
his
seat
with
a
whip
in
his
hand
and
began
his
operations
a
crowd
of
little
boys
the
sons
of
the
labourers
within
now
gathered
round
the
young
gentleman
and
by
their
admiration
very
much
increased
his
ardour
to
distinguish
himself
tommy
began
to
use
the
common
expressions
which
he
had
heard
coachmen
practise
to
their
horses
and
smacked
his
whip
with
all
the
confidence
of
an
experienced
charioteer
cæsar
meanwhile
who
did
not
comprehend
this
language
began
to
be
a
little
impatient
and
expressed
his
uneasiness
by
making
several
bounds
and
rearing
up
like
a
restive
horse
this
added
very
much
to
the
diversion
of
the
spectators
and
tommy
who
considered
his
honour
as
materially
concerned
in
achieving
the
adventure
began
to
be
a
little
more
warm
and
proceeding
from
one
experiment
to
another
at
length
applied
a
pretty
severe
lash
to
the
hinderpart
of
his
steed
this
cæsar
resented
so
much
that
he
instantly
set
off
at
speed
and
dragged
the
chair
with
the
driver
upon
it
at
a
prodigious
rate
tommy
now
looked
round
with
an
infinite
air
of
triumph
and
kept
his
seat
with
surprising
address
and
firmness
unfortunately
there
happened
to
be
at
no
great
distance
a
large
which
went
shelving
down
to
the
depth
of
three
or
four
feet
hither
by
a
kind
of
natural
instinct
the
affrighted
cæsar
ran
when
he
found
he
could
not
disengage
himself
from
his
tormentor
while
tommy
who
now
began
to
repent
of
his
success
endeavoured
to
pacify
and
restrain
him
but
all
his
expostulations
were
vain
for
cæsar
precipitately
rushed
into
the
pond
and
in
an
instant
plunged
into
the
middle
with
his
charioteer
behind
him
the
crowd
of
spectators
had
now
a
fresh
subject
of
diversion
and
all
their
respect
for
master
tommy
could
not
hinder
them
from
bursting
into
shouts
of
derision
the
unfortunate
hero
was
equally
discomposed
at
the
unmannerly
exultation
of
his
attendants
and
at
his
own
ticklish
situation
but
he
did
not
long
wait
for
the
catastrophe
of
his
adventure
for
after
a
little
floundering
in
the
pond
cæsar
by
a
vigorous
exertion
overturned
the
chair
and
tommy
came
roughly
into
the
water
to
add
to
his
misfortune
the
pond
was
at
that
time
neither
ice
nor
water
for
a
sudden
thaw
had
commenced
the
day
before
accompanied
by
a
copious
fall
of
snow
tommy
therefore
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
footing
floundered
on
through
mud
and
water
and
pieces
of
floating
ice
like
some
amphibious
animal
to
the
shore
sometimes
his
feet
slipped
and
down
he
tumbled
and
then
he
struggled
up
again
shaking
the
water
from
his
hair
and
clothes
now
his
feet
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
and
now
by
a
desperate
effort
he
disengaged
himself
with
the
loss
of
both
his
shoes
thus
labouring
on
with
infinite
pain
and
difficulty
he
reached
the
land
the
whole
troop
of
spectators
were
now
incapable
of
stifling
their
laughter
which
broke
forth
in
such
redoubled
peals
that
the
unfortunate
hero
was
irritated
to
an
extreme
degree
of
rage
so
that
forgetting
his
own
sufferings
and
necessities
as
soon
as
he
had
struggled
to
the
shore
he
fell
upon
them
in
a
fury
and
dealt
his
blows
so
liberally
on
every
side
that
he
put
the
whole
company
to
flight
tommy
was
now
in
the
situation
of
a
warrior
that
pursues
a
routed
army
dismay
and
terror
scattered
all
his
little
associates
a
hundred
different
ways
while
passion
and
revenge
animated
him
to
the
pursuit
and
made
him
forgetful
of
the
wetness
of
his
clothes
and
the
uncomfortableness
of
his
situation
whatever
unfortunate
boy
came
within
his
reach
was
sure
to
be
unmercifully
cuffed
and
pommelled
for
in
the
fury
with
which
he
felt
himself
inspired
he
did
not
wait
to
consider
the
exact
rules
of
justice
while
tommy
was
thus
revenging
the
affronts
he
imagined
he
had
received
and
chasing
the
vanquished
about
the
court
the
unusual
noise
and
uproar
which
ensued
reached
the
ears
of
mr
barlow
and
brought
him
to
the
door
he
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
the
rueful
figure
of
his
friend
with
the
water
dropping
from
every
part
of
his
body
in
copious
streams
and
at
the
rage
which
seemed
to
animate
him
in
spite
of
his
disaster
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
tommy
could
compose
himself
enough
to
give
mr
barlow
an
account
of
his
misfortunes
which
when
he
had
heard
he
immediately
led
him
into
the
house
and
advised
him
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
he
then
brought
him
some
warm
diluting
liquors
by
which
means
he
avoided
all
the
bad
effects
which
might
otherwise
have
arisen
from
so
complete
a
drenching
the
next
day
mr
barlow
laughed
at
tommy
in
his
usual
manner
and
asked
him
if
he
intended
to
ride
out
in
the
kamtschatkan
manner
adding
however
that
he
should
be
afraid
to
attend
him
as
he
had
the
habit
of
beating
his
companions
tommy
was
a
little
confounded
at
this
insinuation
but
replied
that
he
should
not
have
been
so
provoked
if
they
had
not
laughed
at
his
misfortunes
and
he
thought
it
very
hard
to
be
wetted
and
ridiculed
both
but
replied
mr
barlow
did
their
noise
or
laughter
do
you
any
great
damage
that
you
endeavoured
to
return
it
so
roughly
tommy
answered
that
he
must
own
it
did
not
do
him
any
hurt
or
give
him
any
pain
why
then
said
mr
barlow
i
do
not
see
the
justice
of
your
returning
it
in
that
manner
but
said
tommy
it
is
so
provoking
to
be
laughed
at
there
are
two
ways
of
remedying
that
replied
mr
barlow
either
not
doing
such
things
as
will
expose
you
to
ridicule
or
by
learning
to
bear
it
with
a
little
more
patience
but
said
tommy
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
can
bear
it
with
patience
all
the
world
said
mr
barlow
are
not
quite
so
passionate
as
you
are
it
is
not
long
ago
that
you
were
speaking
of
the
poor
greenlanders
with
great
contempt
and
fancying
them
much
inferior
to
yourself
yet
those
poor
as
you
called
them
that
live
upon
fish
and
are
not
brought
up
like
gentlemen
sons
are
capable
of
giving
you
a
lesson
that
would
be
of
the
greatest
service
if
you
would
but
observe
it
what
is
that
sir
inquired
tommy
they
are
brought
up
to
so
much
moderation
and
said
mr
barlow
that
they
never
give
way
to
those
sudden
impulses
of
passion
that
are
common
among
the
europeans
and
when
they
observe
their
violent
gestures
their
angry
words
their
countenances
inflamed
with
wrath
they
feel
for
them
the
greatest
contempt
and
say
they
must
have
been
very
badly
educated
as
to
themselves
if
any
person
think
himself
by
another
without
putting
himself
into
any
passion
upon
the
occasion
he
defies
his
foe
to
meet
him
at
a
particular
time
before
all
their
mutual
acquaintance
but
then
i
suppose
they
fight
and
that
is
being
as
passionate
as
i
was
i
am
sorry
that
you
who
pretend
to
have
been
so
well
brought
up
should
have
recourse
to
the
example
of
the
greenlanders
in
order
to
justify
your
own
conduct
but
in
this
case
you
are
mistaken
for
the
barbarians
are
a
great
deal
wiser
than
young
gentlemen
the
person
who
thinks
himself
injured
does
indeed
challenge
his
antagonist
but
it
is
to
a
very
different
sort
of
combat
from
what
you
imagine
both
parties
appear
at
the
appointed
time
and
each
surrounded
with
a
company
of
his
particular
friends
the
place
where
they
assemble
is
generally
the
middle
of
one
of
their
large
huts
that
all
the
persons
of
their
society
may
be
impartial
spectators
of
their
contest
when
they
are
thus
convened
the
champion
who
by
agreement
is
to
begin
steps
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
entertains
them
with
a
song
or
speech
which
he
has
before
meditated
in
this
performance
he
generally
contrives
to
throw
all
the
ridicule
he
is
able
upon
his
antagonist
and
his
satire
is
applauded
by
his
own
party
and
excites
universal
merriment
among
the
audience
when
he
has
sung
or
declaimed
himself
out
of
breath
it
is
the
turn
of
his
rival
to
begin
who
goes
on
in
the
same
manner
answering
all
the
satire
that
has
been
thrown
upon
him
and
endeavouring
to
win
the
laughter
over
to
his
own
side
in
this
manner
do
the
combatants
go
on
alternately
reciting
their
compositions
against
each
other
till
the
memory
or
invention
of
one
of
them
fails
and
he
is
obliged
to
yield
the
victory
to
his
rival
after
this
public
spectacle
of
their
ingenuity
the
two
champions
generally
forget
all
their
animosities
and
are
cordially
reconciled
this
added
mr
barlow
appears
to
me
to
be
a
much
better
method
of
answering
ridicule
than
by
giving
way
to
passion
and
resentment
and
beating
those
that
displease
us
and
one
of
these
honest
greenlanders
would
be
as
much
ashamed
of
such
a
sudden
transport
of
anger
as
a
kamtschatkan
traveller
would
be
of
managing
his
dogs
as
ill
as
you
did

and
now
the
time
arrived
when
tommy
was
by
appointment
to
go
home
and
spend
some
time
with
his
parents
mr
barlow
had
been
long
afraid
of
this
visit
as
he
knew
he
would
meet
a
great
deal
of
company
there
who
would
give
him
impressions
of
a
very
different
nature
from
what
he
had
with
much
assiduity
been
labouring
to
excite
however
the
visit
was
unavoidable
and
mr
merton
sent
so
pressing
an
invitation
for
harry
to
accompany
his
friend
after
having
obtained
the
consent
of
his
father
that
mr
barlow
with
much
regret
took
leave
of
both
his
pupils
harry
from
the
experience
he
had
formerly
acquired
of
polite
life
had
no
great
inclination
for
the
expedition
however
his
temper
was
too
easy
and
obliging
to
raise
any
objections
and
the
real
affection
he
now
entertained
for
master
merton
rendered
him
less
averse
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been
when
they
arrived
at
mr
merton
they
were
introduced
into
a
crowded
full
of
the
most
elegant
company
which
that
part
of
the
country
afforded
among
whom
were
several
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
different
ages
who
had
been
purposely
invited
to
spend
their
holidays
with
master
merton
as
soon
as
master
merton
entered
every
tongue
was
let
loose
in
his
praise
he
was
grown
he
was
improved
he
was
such
a
charming
boy
his
eyes
his
hair
his
teeth
his
every
feature
was
the
admiration
of
all
the
ladies
thrice
did
he
make
the
circle
in
order
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
company
and
to
be
introduced
to
the
young
ladies
as
to
harry
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
taken
notice
of
by
nobody
except
mr
merton
who
received
him
with
great
cordiality
a
lady
however
who
sat
by
mrs
merton
asked
her
in
a
whisper
which
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
all
over
the
room
whether
that
was
the
little
whom
she
had
heard
mr
barlow
was
attempting
to
breed
up
like
a
gentleman
mrs
merton
answered
it
was
i
protest
said
the
lady
i
should
have
thought
so
by
his
plebeian
look
and
vulgar
air
but
i
wonder
my
dear
madam
that
you
will
suffer
your
son
who
without
flattery
is
one
of
the
most
accomplished
children
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
with
quite
the
air
of
fashion
to
keep
such
company
are
you
not
afraid
that
master
merton
should
insensibly
contract
bad
habits
and
a
grovelling
way
of
thinking
for
my
own
part
as
i
think
a
good
education
is
a
thing
of
the
utmost
consequence
in
life
i
have
spared
no
pains
to
give
my
dear
matilda
every
possible
advantage
indeed
replied
mrs
merton
one
may
see
the
excellence
of
her
education
in
everything
miss
matilda
does
she
plays
most
divinely
upon
the
harpsichord
talks
french
even
better
than
she
does
english
and
draws
in
the
style
of
a
master
indeed
i
think
that
last
figure
of
the
the
finest
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
in
one
part
of
the
room
a
young
lady
observing
that
nobody
seemed
to
take
the
least
notice
of
harry
advanced
towards
him
with
the
greatest
affability
and
began
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
this
young
lady
name
was
simmons
her
father
and
mother
had
been
two
of
the
most
respectable
people
in
the
country
according
to
the
old
style
of
english
gentry
but
he
having
died
while
she
was
young
the
care
of
her
had
devolved
upon
an
uncle
who
was
a
man
of
sense
and
benevolence
but
a
very
great
humorist
this
gentleman
had
such
peculiar
ideas
of
female
character
that
he
waged
war
with
most
of
the
polite
and
modern
accomplishments
as
one
of
the
first
blessings
of
life
according
to
his
notions
was
health
he
endeavoured
to
prevent
that
sickly
delicacy
which
is
considered
as
so
great
an
ornament
in
fashionable
life
by
a
more
robust
and
hardy
education
his
niece
was
accustomed
from
her
earliest
years
to
plunge
into
the
cold
bath
at
every
season
of
the
year
to
rise
by
in
winter
to
ride
a
dozen
miles
upon
a
trotting
horse
or
to
walk
as
many
even
with
the
hazard
of
being
splashed
or
soiling
her
clothes
by
this
mode
of
education
miss
sukey
for
so
she
had
the
misfortune
to
be
named
acquired
an
excellent
character
accompanied
however
with
some
dispositions
which
disqualified
her
almost
as
much
as
harry
for
fashionable
life
she
was
acquainted
with
all
the
best
authors
in
our
language
nor
was
she
ignorant
of
those
in
french
although
she
could
not
speak
a
word
of
the
language
her
uncle
who
was
a
man
of
sense
and
knowledge
had
besides
instructed
her
in
several
parts
of
knowledge
which
rarely
fall
to
the
lot
of
ladies
such
as
the
established
laws
of
nature
and
a
small
degree
of
geometry
she
was
besides
brought
up
to
every
species
of
household
employment
which
is
now
exploded
by
ladies
of
every
rank
and
station
as
mean
and
vulgar
and
taught
to
believe
that
domestic
economy
is
a
point
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
every
woman
who
intends
to
be
a
wife
or
mother
as
to
music
though
miss
simmons
had
a
very
agreeable
voice
and
could
sing
several
simple
songs
in
a
very
pleasing
manner
she
was
entirely
ignorant
of
it
her
uncle
used
to
say
that
human
life
is
not
long
enough
to
throw
away
so
much
time
upon
the
science
of
a
nor
would
he
permit
her
to
learn
french
although
he
understood
it
himself
women
he
thought
are
not
birds
of
passage
that
are
to
be
eternally
changing
their
place
of
abode
i
have
never
seen
any
good
would
he
say
from
the
importation
of
foreign
manners
every
virtue
may
be
learned
and
practised
at
home
and
it
is
only
because
we
do
not
choose
to
have
either
virtue
or
religion
among
us
that
so
many
adventurers
are
yearly
sent
out
to
smuggle
foreign
graces
as
to
various
languages
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
them
for
a
woman
my
niece
is
to
marry
an
englishman
and
to
live
in
england
to
what
purpose
then
should
i
labour
to
take
off
the
difficulty
of
conversing
with
foreigners
and
to
promote
her
intercourse
with
barbers
valets
and
adventurers
of
every
description
that
are
continually
doing
us
the
honour
to
come
among
us
as
to
the
french
nation
i
know
and
esteem
it
on
many
accounts
but
i
am
very
doubtful
whether
the
english
will
ever
gain
much
by
adopting
either
their
manners
or
their
government
and
when
respectable
foreigners
choose
to
visit
us
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
take
the
trouble
of
learning
the
language
of
the
country
such
had
been
the
education
of
miss
simmons
who
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
genteel
company
at
mr
merton
that
thought
harry
deserving
the
least
attention
this
young
lady
who
possessed
an
uncommon
degree
of
natural
benevolence
of
character
came
up
to
him
in
such
a
manner
as
set
him
perfectly
at
his
ease
harry
was
destitute
of
the
artificial
graces
of
society
but
he
possessed
that
natural
politeness
and
good
nature
without
which
all
artificial
graces
are
the
most
disgusting
things
in
the
world
harry
had
an
understanding
naturally
strong
and
mr
barlow
while
he
had
with
the
greatest
care
preserved
him
from
all
false
impressions
had
taken
great
pains
in
cultivating
the
faculties
of
his
mind
harry
indeed
never
said
any
of
those
brilliant
things
which
render
a
boy
the
darling
of
the
ladies
he
had
not
that
vivacity
or
rather
impertinence
which
frequently
passes
for
wit
with
superficial
people
but
he
paid
the
greatest
attention
to
what
was
said
to
him
and
made
the
most
judicious
observations
upon
subjects
he
understood
for
this
reason
miss
simmons
although
much
older
and
more
improved
received
great
satisfaction
from
conversing
with
him
and
thought
little
harry
infinitely
more
agreeable
and
judicious
than
any
of
the
smart
young
gentlemen
she
had
hitherto
seen
at
mr
merton
but
now
the
company
was
summoned
to
the
important
business
of
dinner
harry
could
not
help
sighing
when
he
reflected
on
what
he
had
to
undergo
however
he
determined
to
bear
it
with
all
imaginable
fortitude
for
the
sake
of
his
friend
tommy
the
dinner
indeed
was
if
possible
more
dreadful
than
anything
he
had
before
undergone
so
many
fine
gentlemen
and
fine
ladies
so
many
powdered
servants
to
stand
behind
their
chairs
such
an
apparatus
of
dishes
which
harry
had
never
tasted
before
and
which
almost
made
him
sick
when
he
did
taste
so
many
removes
such
pomp
and
solemnity
about
what
seemed
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
that
harry
could
not
help
envying
the
condition
of
his
father
labourers
who
when
they
are
hungry
can
sit
at
their
ease
under
a
hedge
and
make
a
dinner
without
plates
or
compliments
in
the
mean
time
his
friend
tommy
was
received
amid
the
circle
of
the
ladies
and
attended
to
as
a
prodigy
of
wit
and
ingenuity
harry
could
not
help
being
surprised
at
this
his
affection
for
his
friend
was
totally
unmixed
with
the
meanness
of
jealousy
and
he
received
the
sincerest
pleasure
from
every
improvement
which
tommy
had
made
however
he
had
never
discovered
in
him
any
of
those
surprising
talents
and
when
he
could
catch
anything
that
tommy
said
it
appeared
to
him
rather
inferior
to
his
usual
method
of
conversation
however
as
so
many
fine
ladies
were
of
a
different
opinion
he
took
it
for
granted
that
he
must
be
mistaken
but
if
harry
opinion
of
his
friend
abilities
was
not
much
improved
by
this
exhibition
it
was
not
so
with
tommy
the
repeated
assurances
which
he
received
that
he
was
indeed
a
little
began
to
convince
him
that
he
really
was
so
when
he
considered
the
company
he
came
from
he
found
that
infinite
injustice
had
been
done
to
his
merit
for
at
mr
barlow
he
was
frequently
contradicted
and
obliged
to
give
a
reason
for
what
he
said
but
here
in
order
to
be
admired
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
whether
he
had
any
meaning
or
not
his
auditors
always
found
either
wit
or
sense
or
a
most
entertaining
sprightliness
in
all
he
said
nor
was
mrs
merton
herself
deficient
in
bestowing
marks
of
admiration
upon
her
son
to
see
him
before
improved
in
health
in
understanding
in
virtue
had
given
her
a
pleasurable
sensation
for
she
was
by
no
means
destitute
of
good
dispositions
but
to
see
him
shine
with
such
transcendant
brightness
before
such
excellent
judges
and
in
so
polite
a
company
inspired
her
with
raptures
she
had
never
felt
before
indeed
in
consequence
of
this
success
the
young
gentleman
volubility
improved
so
much
that
before
dinner
was
over
he
seemed
disposed
to
engross
the
whole
conversation
to
himself
and
mr
merton
who
did
not
quite
relish
the
sallies
of
his
son
so
much
as
his
wife
was
once
or
twice
obliged
to
interpose
and
check
him
in
his
career
this
mrs
merton
thought
very
hard
and
all
the
ladies
after
they
had
retired
into
the
agreed
that
his
father
would
certainly
spoil
his
temper
by
such
improper
contradiction
as
to
little
harry
he
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
please
the
greater
number
of
the
ladies
they
observed
that
he
was
awkward
and
ungenteel
and
had
a
heavy
clownish
look
he
was
also
silent
and
reserved
and
had
not
said
a
single
agreeable
thing
if
mr
barlow
chose
to
keep
a
school
for
carters
and
threshers
nobody
would
hinder
him
but
it
was
not
proper
to
introduce
such
vulgar
people
to
the
sons
of
persons
of
fashion
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
mr
barlow
ought
either
to
send
little
harry
home
to
his
friends
or
to
be
no
more
honoured
with
the
company
of
master
merton
indeed
one
of
the
ladies
hinted
that
mr
barlow
himself
was
but
an
odd
kind
of
man
who
never
went
to
assemblies
and
played
upon
no
kind
of
instrument
why
answered
mrs
merton
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
not
over
fond
of
the
scheme
mr
barlow
to
be
sure
though
a
very
good
is
a
very
odd
kind
of
man
however
as
he
is
so
disinterested
and
would
never
receive
the
least
present
from
us
i
doubt
whether
we
could
with
propriety
insist
upon
his
turning
little
sandford
out
of
the
house
if
that
is
the
case
madam
answered
mrs
compton
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
lady
i
think
it
would
be
infinitely
better
to
remove
master
merton
and
place
him
in
some
polite
seminary
where
he
might
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
world
and
make
genteel
connections
this
will
always
be
the
greatest
advantage
to
a
young
gentleman
and
will
prove
of
the
most
essential
service
to
him
in
life
for
though
a
person
has
all
the
merit
in
the
world
without
such
acquaintance
it
will
never
push
him
forward
or
enable
him
to
make
a
figure
this
is
the
plan
which
i
have
always
pursued
with
augustus
and
matilda
i
think
i
may
say
not
entirely
without
success
for
they
have
both
the
good
fortune
to
have
formed
the
most
brilliant
acquaintances
as
to
augustus
he
is
so
intimate
with
young
lord
squander
who
you
know
is
possessed
of
the
greatest
parliamentary
interest
that
i
think
that
his
fortune
is
as
good
as
made
miss
simmons
who
was
present
at
this
refined
and
wise
conversation
could
not
help
looking
with
so
much
significance
at
this
mention
of
lord
squander
that
mrs
compton
coloured
a
little
and
asked
with
some
warmth
whether
she
knew
anything
of
that
young
nobleman
why
madam
answered
the
young
lady
what
i
know
is
very
little
but
if
you
desire
me
to
inform
you
it
is
my
duty
to
speak
the
truth
oh
to
be
sure
miss
replied
mrs
compton
a
little
angrily
we
all
know
that
your
and
of
the
world
are
superior
to
what
anybody
else
can
boast
and
therefore
i
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
any
you
may
be
pleased
to
give
indeed
madam
answered
the
young
lady
i
have
very
little
of
either
to
boast
nor
am
i
personally
acquainted
with
the
nobleman
you
are
talking
of
but
i
have
a
cousin
a
very
good
boy
who
is
at
the
same
public
school
with
his
lordship
and
he
has
given
me
such
a
character
of
him
as
does
not
much
prepossess
me
in
his
favour
and
what
may
this
wise
cousin
of
yours
have
said
of
his
lordship
madam
that
he
is
one
of
the
worst
boys
in
the
whole
school
that
he
has
neither
genius
nor
application
for
anything
that
becomes
his
rank
and
situation
that
he
has
no
taste
for
anything
but
gaming
and
the
most
contemptible
amusements
that
though
his
allowance
is
large
he
is
continually
running
in
debt
with
everybody
that
will
trust
him
and
that
he
has
broken
his
word
so
often
that
nobody
has
the
least
confidence
in
what
he
says
added
to
this
i
have
heard
that
he
is
so
haughty
tyrannical
and
overbearing
that
nobody
can
long
preserve
his
friendship
without
the
meanest
flattery
and
subservience
to
all
his
vicious
inclinations
and
to
finish
all
that
he
is
of
so
ungrateful
a
temper
that
he
was
never
known
to
do
an
act
of
kindness
to
any
one
or
to
care
about
anything
but
himself
here
miss
matilda
could
not
help
interposing
with
warmth
she
said
that
his
lordship
had
nothing
in
his
character
or
manners
that
did
not
perfectly
become
a
nobleman
of
the
most
elevated
soul
little
grovelling
minds
indeed
which
are
always
envious
of
their
superiors
might
give
a
disagreeable
turn
to
the
generous
openness
of
this
young
temper
that
as
to
gaming
and
running
in
debt
they
were
so
essential
to
a
man
of
fashion
that
nobody
who
was
not
born
in
the
city
and
oppressed
by
city
prejudices
would
think
of
making
the
least
objection
to
them
she
then
made
a
panegyric
upon
his
lordship
person
his
elegant
taste
and
dress
his
new
phaeton
his
entertaining
conversation
his
extraordinary
performance
upon
the
violin
and
concluded
that
with
such
abilities
and
accomplishments
she
did
not
doubt
of
one
day
seeing
him
at
the
head
of
the
nation
miss
simmons
had
no
desire
of
pushing
the
conversation
any
farther
and
the
rest
of
the
company
coming
in
to
tea
the
disquisition
about
lord
squander
finished
after
tea
several
of
the
young
ladies
were
desired
to
amuse
the
company
with
music
and
singing
among
the
rest
miss
simmons
sang
a
little
scotch
song
called
lochaber
in
so
artless
but
sweet
and
pathetic
a
manner
that
little
harry
listened
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
though
several
of
the
young
ladies
by
their
significant
looks
and
gestures
treated
it
with
ineffable
contempt
after
this
miss
matilda
who
was
allowed
to
be
a
perfect
mistress
of
music
played
and
sang
several
celebrated
italian
airs
but
as
these
were
in
a
language
totally
unintelligible
to
harry
he
received
very
little
pleasure
though
all
the
rest
of
the
company
were
in
raptures
she
then
proceeded
to
play
several
pieces
of
music
which
were
allowed
by
all
connoisseurs
to
require
infinite
skill
to
execute
the
audience
seemed
all
delighted
and
either
felt
or
pretended
to
feel
inexpressible
pleasure
even
tommy
himself
who
did
not
know
one
note
from
another
had
caught
so
much
of
the
general
enthusiasm
that
he
applauded
as
loud
as
the
rest
of
the
company
but
harry
whose
temper
was
not
quite
so
pliable
could
not
conceal
the
intolerable
weariness
that
overpowered
his
senses
during
this
long
exhibition
he
gaped
he
yawned
he
stretched
he
even
pinched
himself
in
order
to
keep
his
attention
alive
but
all
in
vain
the
more
miss
matilda
exercised
her
skill
in
playing
pieces
of
the
most
difficult
execution
the
more
did
propensity
to
drowsiness
increase
at
length
the
lateness
of
the
hour
which
much
exceeded
harry
time
of
going
to
bed
conspiring
with
the
opiate
charms
of
music
he
could
resist
no
longer
but
insensibly
fell
back
upon
his
chair
fast
asleep
this
unfortunate
accident
was
soon
remarked
by
the
rest
of
the
company
and
confirmed
them
very
much
in
the
opinion
they
had
conceived
of
harry
vulgarity
while
he
in
the
meantime
enjoyed
the
most
placid
slumber
which
was
not
dissipated
till
miss
matilda
had
desisted
from
playing
thus
was
the
first
day
passed
at
mr
merton
very
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
harry
the
next
and
the
next
after
were
only
repetitions
of
the
same
scene
the
little
gentry
whose
tastes
and
manners
were
totally
different
from
his
had
now
imbibed
a
perfect
contempt
for
harry
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
they
condescended
to
treat
him
even
with
common
civility
in
this
behaviour
they
were
very
much
confirmed
by
master
compton
and
master
mash
master
compton
was
reckoned
a
very
genteel
boy
though
all
his
gentility
consisted
in
a
pair
of
buckles
so
big
that
they
almost
crippled
him
in
a
slender
emaciated
figure
and
a
look
of
consummate
impudence
he
had
almost
finished
his
education
at
a
public
school
where
he
had
learned
every
vice
and
folly
which
is
commonly
taught
at
such
places
without
the
least
improvement
either
of
his
character
or
his
understanding
master
mash
was
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
gentleman
who
had
considerably
impaired
his
fortune
by
an
inordinate
love
of
having
been
from
his
infancy
accustomed
to
no
other
conversation
than
about
winning
and
losing
money
he
had
acquired
the
idea
that
to
bet
successfully
was
the
summit
of
all
human
ambition
he
had
been
almost
brought
up
in
the
stable
and
therefore
had
imbibed
the
greatest
interest
about
horses
not
from
any
real
affection
for
that
noble
animal
but
merely
because
he
considered
them
as
engines
for
the
winning
of
money
he
too
was
now
improving
his
talents
by
a
public
education
and
longed
impatiently
for
the
time
when
he
should
be
set
free
from
all
restraint
and
allowed
to
display
the
superiority
of
his
genius
at
ascot
and
newmarket
these
two
young
gentlemen
had
conceived
the
most
violent
dislike
to
harry
and
lost
no
occasion
of
saying
or
doing
everything
they
had
in
their
power
to
mortify
him
to
tommy
they
were
in
the
contrary
extreme
and
omitted
no
opportunity
of
rendering
themselves
agreeable
to
him
nor
was
it
long
before
their
forward
vivacious
manners
accompanied
with
a
knowledge
of
many
of
those
gay
scenes
which
acted
forcibly
upon
tommy
imagination
began
to
render
their
conversation
highly
agreeable
they
talked
to
him
about
public
diversions
about
celebrated
actresses
about
parties
of
pleasure
and
parties
of
mischief
tommy
began
to
feel
himself
introduced
to
a
new
train
of
ideas
and
a
wider
range
of
conduct
he
began
to
long
for
the
time
when
he
should
share
in
the
glories
of
robbing
orchards
or
insulting
passengers
with
impunity
but
when
he
heard
that
little
boys
scarcely
bigger
than
himself
had
often
joined
in
the
glorious
project
of
forming
open
rebellions
against
their
masters
or
of
disturbing
a
whole
audience
at
a
playhouse
he
panted
for
the
time
when
he
might
have
a
chance
of
sharing
in
the
fame
of
such
achievements
by
degrees
he
lost
all
regard
for
mr
barlow
and
all
affection
for
his
friend
harry
at
first
indeed
he
was
shocked
at
hearing
mr
barlow
mentioned
with
disrespect
but
becoming
by
degrees
more
callous
to
every
good
impression
he
at
last
took
infinite
pleasure
in
seeing
master
mash
who
though
destitute
of
either
wit
or
genius
had
a
great
taste
for
mimicry
take
off
the
in
the
middle
of
his
harry
perceived
and
lamented
this
change
in
the
manners
of
his
friend
he
sometimes
took
the
liberty
of
remonstrating
with
him
upon
the
subject
but
was
only
answered
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
and
master
mash
who
happened
once
to
be
present
told
him
that
he
was
a
it
happened
that
while
harry
was
at
mr
merton
there
was
a
troop
of
strolling
players
at
a
neighbouring
town
in
order
to
divert
the
young
gentry
mr
merton
contrived
that
they
should
make
a
party
to
see
a
play
they
went
accordingly
and
harry
with
the
rest
tommy
who
now
no
longer
condescended
to
take
any
notice
of
his
friend
harry
was
seated
between
his
two
new
acquaintances
who
had
become
his
inseparable
companions
these
young
gentlemen
first
began
to
give
specimens
of
their
by
throwing
nuts
and
upon
the
stage
and
tommy
who
was
resolved
to
profit
by
such
an
example
threw
nuts
and
with
infinite
satisfaction
as
soon
as
the
curtain
drew
up
and
the
actors
appeared
all
the
rest
of
the
audience
observed
a
decent
silence
but
mash
and
compton
who
were
now
determined
to
prove
the
of
their
manners
began
to
talk
so
loud
and
make
so
much
noise
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
near
them
to
hear
a
word
of
the
play
this
also
seemed
amazingly
to
tommy
and
he
too
talked
and
laughed
as
loud
as
the
rest
the
subject
of
their
conversation
was
the
audience
and
the
performers
neither
of
whom
these
polite
young
gentlemen
found
bearable
the
was
chiefly
composed
of
the
tradesmen
of
the
town
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
country
this
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
these
refined
young
gentlemen
to
speak
of
them
with
the
most
insufferable
contempt
every
circumstance
of
their
dress
and
appearance
was
criticised
with
such
a
minuteness
of
attention
that
harry
who
sat
near
and
very
much
against
his
inclination
was
witness
to
all
that
passed
began
to
imagine
that
his
companions
instead
of
being
brought
up
like
the
sons
of
gentlemen
had
only
studied
under
barbers
and
tailors
such
amazing
knowledge
did
they
display
in
the
history
of
buckles
buttons
and
dressing
of
hair
as
to
the
poor
they
found
them
totally
undeserving
of
mercy
they
were
so
shockingly
awkward
so
so
and
such
detestable
creatures
that
it
was
impossible
to
bear
them
with
any
patience
master
mash
who
prided
himself
upon
being
a
young
gentleman
of
great
spirit
was
of
opinion
that
they
should
up
a
and
demolish
all
the
scenery
tommy
indeed
did
not
very
well
understand
what
the
expression
meant
but
he
was
so
intimately
persuaded
of
the
merit
and
genius
of
his
companions
that
he
agreed
that
it
would
be
the
most
proper
thing
in
the
world
and
the
proposal
was
accordingly
made
to
the
rest
of
the
young
gentlemen
but
harry
who
had
been
silent
all
the
time
could
not
help
remonstrating
at
what
appeared
to
him
the
greatest
injustice
and
cruelty
these
poor
people
said
he
are
doing
all
they
can
to
entertain
us
is
it
not
very
unkind
to
treat
them
in
return
with
scorn
and
contempt
if
they
could
act
better
even
as
well
as
those
fine
people
you
talk
of
in
london
would
they
not
willingly
do
it
and
therefore
why
should
we
be
angry
with
them
for
what
they
can
not
help
and
as
to
cutting
the
scenes
to
pieces
or
doing
the
house
any
damage
have
we
any
more
right
to
attempt
it
than
they
would
have
to
come
into
your
father
and
break
the
dishes
to
pieces
because
they
did
not
like
the
dinner
while
we
are
here
let
us
behave
with
good
manners
and
if
we
do
not
like
their
acting
it
is
our
own
faults
if
ever
we
come
to
see
them
again
this
method
of
reasoning
was
not
much
relished
by
those
to
whom
it
was
addressed
and
it
is
uncertain
how
far
they
might
have
proceeded
had
not
a
decent
man
who
had
been
long
disturbed
with
the
noise
of
these
young
gentry
at
length
taken
the
liberty
of
expostulating
with
them
upon
the
subject
this
freedom
or
as
it
was
termed
by
master
mash
was
answered
by
him
with
so
much
rudeness
that
the
man
who
was
a
neighbouring
farmer
was
obliged
to
reply
in
a
higher
strain
thus
did
the
altercation
increase
every
minute
till
master
mash
who
thought
it
an
unpardonable
affront
that
any
one
in
an
inferior
station
should
presume
to
think
or
feel
for
himself
so
far
lost
all
command
of
his
temper
as
to
call
the
man
a
and
strike
him
upon
the
face
but
the
farmer
who
possessed
great
strength
and
equal
resolution
very
deliberately
laid
hold
of
the
young
gentleman
who
had
offered
him
the
insult
and
without
the
smallest
exertion
laid
him
sprawling
upon
the
ground
at
his
full
length
under
the
benches
and
setting
his
feet
upon
his
body
told
him
that
since
he
did
not
know
how
to
quiet
at
a
play
he
would
have
the
honour
of
teaching
him
to
and
that
if
he
offered
to
stir
he
would
trample
him
to
pieces
a
threat
which
was
very
evident
he
could
find
no
difficulty
in
executing
this
unexpected
incident
struck
a
universal
damp
over
the
spirits
of
the
little
gentry
and
even
master
mash
himself
so
far
forgot
his
dignity
as
to
supplicate
in
a
very
submissive
manner
for
a
release
in
this
he
was
joined
by
all
his
companions
and
harry
among
the
rest
well
said
the
farmer
i
should
never
have
thought
that
a
parcel
of
young
gentlemen
as
you
call
yourselves
would
come
into
public
to
behave
with
so
much
rudeness
i
am
sure
that
there
is
a
ploughboy
at
my
house
but
what
would
have
shown
more
sense
and
manners
but
since
you
are
sorry
for
what
has
happened
i
am
very
willing
to
make
an
end
of
the
affair
more
especially
for
the
sake
of
this
little
master
here
who
has
behaved
with
so
much
propriety
that
i
am
sure
he
is
a
better
gentleman
than
any
of
you
though
he
is
not
dressed
so
much
like
a
monkey
or
a
barber
with
these
words
he
suffered
the
crestfallen
mash
to
rise
who
crept
from
his
place
of
confinement
with
looks
infinitely
more
expressive
of
mildness
than
he
had
brought
with
him
nor
was
the
lesson
lost
upon
the
others
for
they
behaved
with
the
greatest
decency
during
the
rest
of
the
exhibition
however
master
mash
courage
began
to
rise
as
he
went
home
and
found
himself
farther
from
his
formidable
farmer
for
he
assured
his
companions
that
if
he
had
not
been
so
vulgar
a
fellow
he
would
certainly
call
him
out
and
pistol
him
the
next
day
at
dinner
mr
merton
and
the
ladies
who
had
not
accompanied
the
young
gentlemen
to
the
play
nor
had
yet
heard
of
the
misfortune
which
had
ensued
were
very
inquisitive
about
the
preceding
entertainment
the
young
people
agreed
that
the
performers
were
detestable
but
that
the
play
was
a
charming
piece
full
of
wit
and
sentiment
and
extremely
improving
this
play
was
called
marriage
of
and
master
compton
had
informed
them
that
it
was
amazingly
admired
by
all
the
people
of
fashion
in
london
but
mr
merton
who
had
observed
that
harry
was
totally
silent
at
length
insisted
upon
knowing
his
opinion
upon
the
subject
why
sir
answered
harry
i
am
very
little
judge
of
these
matters
for
i
never
saw
a
play
before
in
my
life
and
therefore
i
can
not
tell
whether
it
was
acted
well
or
ill
but
as
to
the
play
itself
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
full
of
nothing
but
cheating
and
dissimulation
and
the
people
that
come
in
and
out
do
nothing
but
impose
upon
each
other
and
lie
and
trick
and
deceive
were
you
or
any
gentlemen
to
have
such
a
parcel
of
servants
you
would
think
them
fit
for
nothing
in
the
world
and
therefore
i
could
not
help
wondering
while
the
play
was
acting
that
people
would
throw
away
so
much
of
their
time
upon
sights
that
can
do
them
no
good
and
send
their
children
and
their
relations
to
learn
fraud
and
insincerity
mr
merton
smiled
at
the
honest
bluntness
of
harry
but
several
of
the
ladies
who
had
just
been
expressing
an
extravagant
admiration
of
this
piece
seemed
to
be
not
a
little
mortified
however
as
they
could
not
contradict
the
charges
which
harry
had
brought
against
it
they
thought
it
most
prudent
to
be
silent
in
the
evening
it
was
proposed
that
all
the
little
gentry
should
divert
themselves
with
cards
and
they
accordingly
sat
down
to
a
game
which
is
called
commerce
but
harry
who
was
totally
ignorant
of
this
accomplishment
desired
to
be
excused
however
his
friend
miss
simmons
offered
to
teach
him
the
game
which
she
assured
him
was
so
easy
that
in
three
minutes
he
would
be
able
to
play
as
well
as
the
rest
harry
however
still
continued
to
refuse
and
at
last
confessed
to
miss
simmons
that
he
had
expended
all
his
money
the
day
before
and
therefore
was
unable
to
furnish
the
stake
which
the
rest
deposited
do
let
that
disturb
you
said
she
i
will
put
down
for
you
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
madam
answered
harry
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
sure
but
mr
barlow
has
always
forbidden
me
either
to
receive
or
borrow
money
of
anybody
for
fear
in
the
one
case
i
should
become
mercenary
or
in
the
other
dishonest
and
therefore
though
there
is
nobody
here
whom
i
esteem
more
than
yourself
i
am
obliged
to
refuse
your
offer
well
replied
miss
simmons
that
need
not
disturb
you
for
you
shall
play
upon
my
account
and
that
you
may
do
without
any
violation
of
your
principles
thus
was
harry
though
with
some
reluctance
induced
to
sit
down
to
cards
with
the
rest
the
game
indeed
he
found
no
difficulty
in
learning
but
he
could
not
help
remarking
with
wonder
the
extreme
solicitude
which
appeared
in
the
face
of
all
the
players
at
every
change
of
fortune
even
the
young
ladies
all
but
miss
simmons
seemed
to
be
equally
sensible
of
the
passion
of
gaining
money
with
the
rest
and
some
of
them
behaved
with
a
degree
of
asperity
which
quite
astonished
him
after
several
changes
of
fortune
it
happened
that
miss
simmons
and
harry
were
the
only
remaining
players
all
the
rest
by
the
laws
of
the
game
had
forfeited
all
pretensions
to
the
stake
the
property
of
which
was
clearly
vested
in
these
two
and
one
more
deal
was
wanting
to
decide
it
but
harry
with
great
politeness
rose
from
the
table
and
told
miss
simmons
that
as
he
only
played
upon
her
account
he
was
no
longer
wanted
and
that
the
whole
undoubtedly
belonged
to
her
miss
simmons
refused
to
take
it
and
when
she
found
that
harry
was
not
to
be
induced
to
play
any
more
she
at
last
proposed
to
him
to
divide
what
was
left
this
also
harry
declined
alleging
that
he
had
not
the
least
title
to
any
part
but
miss
simmons
who
began
to
be
uneasy
at
the
remarks
which
this
extraordinary
contest
occasioned
told
harry
that
he
would
oblige
her
by
taking
his
share
of
the
money
and
laying
it
out
in
any
manner
for
her
that
he
judged
best
on
this
condition
answered
harry
i
will
take
it
and
i
think
i
know
a
method
of
laying
it
out
which
you
will
not
entirely
disapprove
the
next
day
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
harry
disappeared
nor
was
he
come
back
when
the
company
were
assembled
at
dinner
at
length
he
came
in
with
a
glow
of
health
and
exercise
upon
his
face
and
that
disorder
of
dress
which
is
produced
by
a
long
journey
the
young
ladies
eyed
him
with
great
contempt
which
seemed
a
little
to
disconcert
him
but
mr
merton
speaking
to
him
with
great
and
making
room
for
him
to
sit
down
harry
soon
recovered
from
his
confusion
in
the
evening
after
a
long
conversation
among
the
young
people
about
public
diversions
and
plays
and
actors
and
dancers
they
happened
to
mention
the
name
of
a
celebrated
performer
who
at
this
time
engaged
the
whole
attention
of
the
town
master
compton
after
expatiating
with
great
enthusiasm
upon
the
subject
added
that
nothing
was
so
fashionable
as
to
make
great
presents
to
this
person
in
order
to
show
the
taste
and
elegance
of
the
giver
he
then
proposed
that
as
so
many
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
were
here
assembled
they
should
set
an
example
which
would
do
them
infinite
honour
and
probably
be
followed
throughout
the
kingdom
of
making
a
little
collection
among
themselves
to
buy
a
piece
of
plate
or
a
gold
or
some
other
trifle
to
be
presented
in
their
name
he
added
that
though
he
could
the
money
having
just
laid
out
six
guineas
upon
a
new
pair
of
buckles
he
would
contribute
a
guinea
to
so
excellent
a
purpose
and
that
masters
mash
and
merton
would
do
the
same
this
proposal
was
universally
approved
of
by
all
the
company
and
all
but
harry
promised
to
contribute
in
proportion
to
their
finances
this
master
mash
observing
said
well
farmer
and
what
will
you
subscribe
harry
answered
that
on
this
occasion
he
must
beg
to
be
excused
for
he
had
nothing
to
give
here
is
a
pretty
fellow
answered
mash
last
night
we
saw
him
pocket
thirty
shillings
of
our
money
which
he
cheated
us
out
of
at
commerce
and
now
the
little
stingy
wretch
will
not
contribute
while
we
are
giving
away
whole
guineas
upon
this
miss
matilda
said
in
an
ironical
manner
that
master
harry
had
always
an
excellent
reason
to
give
for
his
conduct
and
she
did
not
doubt
but
he
could
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
them
all
that
it
was
more
liberal
to
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
than
to
give
it
away
harry
who
was
a
little
nettled
at
these
reflections
answered
that
though
he
was
not
bound
to
give
any
reason
he
thought
he
had
a
very
good
one
to
give
and
that
was
that
he
saw
no
generosity
in
thus
bestowing
money
according
to
your
own
account
added
he
the
person
you
have
been
talking
of
gains
more
than
fifty
poor
families
in
the
country
have
to
maintain
themselves
and
therefore
if
i
had
any
money
to
give
away
i
should
certainly
give
it
to
those
that
want
it
most
with
these
words
harry
went
out
of
the
room
and
the
rest
of
the
gentry
after
abusing
him
very
liberally
sat
down
to
cards
but
miss
simmons
who
imagined
that
there
was
more
in
harry
conduct
than
he
had
explained
excused
herself
from
cards
and
took
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
him
upon
the
subject
after
speaking
to
him
with
great
she
asked
him
whether
it
might
not
have
been
better
to
have
contributed
something
along
with
the
rest
than
to
have
offended
them
by
so
free
an
exposition
of
his
sentiments
even
though
he
did
not
approve
of
the
scheme
indeed
madam
said
harry
this
is
what
i
would
gladly
have
done
but
it
was
totally
out
of
my
power
how
can
that
be
harry
did
you
not
the
other
night
win
nearly
thirty
shillings
that
madam
all
belonged
to
you
and
i
have
already
disposed
of
it
in
your
name
in
a
manner
that
i
hope
you
will
not
disapprove
how
is
that
inquired
the
young
lady
with
some
surprise
madam
said
harry
there
was
a
young
woman
who
lived
with
my
father
as
a
servant
and
always
behaved
with
the
greatest
honesty
and
carefulness
this
young
woman
had
an
aged
father
and
mother
who
for
a
great
while
were
able
to
maintain
themselves
by
their
labour
but
at
last
the
poor
old
man
became
too
weak
to
do
a
day
work
and
his
wife
was
afflicted
with
a
disease
they
call
the
palsy
now
when
this
good
young
woman
saw
that
her
parents
were
in
such
great
distress
she
left
her
place
and
went
to
live
with
them
on
purpose
to
take
care
of
them
and
she
works
very
hard
whenever
she
can
get
work
and
fares
very
hard
in
order
to
maintain
her
parents
and
though
we
assist
them
all
we
can
i
know
that
sometimes
they
can
hardly
get
food
and
clothes
therefore
madam
as
you
were
so
kind
to
say
i
should
dispose
of
this
money
for
you
i
ran
over
this
morning
to
these
poor
people
and
gave
them
all
the
money
in
your
name
and
i
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
at
the
use
i
have
put
it
to
indeed
answered
the
young
lady
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
good
opinion
you
have
of
me
and
the
application
of
it
does
me
a
great
deal
of
honour
i
am
only
sorry
you
did
not
give
it
in
your
own
name
that
replied
harry
i
had
not
any
right
to
do
it
would
have
been
attributing
to
myself
what
did
not
belong
to
me
and
equally
inconsistent
with
truth
and
honesty
in
this
manner
did
the
time
pass
away
at
mr
merton
while
harry
received
very
little
satisfaction
from
his
visit
except
in
conversing
with
miss
simmons
the
affability
and
good
sense
of
this
young
lady
had
entirely
gained
his
confidence
while
all
the
other
young
ladies
were
continually
intent
upon
displaying
their
talents
and
importance
she
alone
was
simple
and
unaffected
but
what
disgusted
harry
more
than
ever
was
that
his
refined
companions
seemed
to
consider
themselves
and
a
few
of
their
acquaintance
as
the
only
beings
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
the
most
trifling
inconvenience
the
being
a
little
too
hot
a
little
too
cold
the
walking
a
few
hundred
yards
the
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
their
dinner
the
having
a
trifling
cold
or
a
little
headache
were
misfortunes
so
feelingly
lamented
that
he
would
have
imagined
they
were
the
most
tender
of
the
human
species
had
he
not
observed
that
they
considered
the
sufferings
of
all
below
them
with
a
profound
indifference
if
the
misfortunes
of
the
poor
were
mentioned
he
heard
of
nothing
but
the
insolence
and
ingratitude
of
that
class
of
people
which
seemed
to
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
the
want
of
common
humanity
surely
said
harry
to
himself
there
can
not
be
so
much
difference
between
one
human
being
and
another
or
if
there
is
i
should
think
that
part
of
them
the
most
valuable
who
cultivate
the
ground
and
provide
necessaries
for
all
the
rest
not
those
who
understand
nothing
but
dress
walking
with
their
toes
out
staring
modest
people
out
of
countenance
and
jabbering
a
few
words
of
a
foreign
language
but
now
the
attention
of
all
the
younger
part
of
the
company
was
fixed
upon
making
preparations
for
a
ball
which
mrs
merton
had
determined
to
give
in
honour
of
master
tommy
return
the
whole
house
was
now
full
of
milliners
and
and
all
the
young
ladies
were
employed
in
giving
directions
about
their
clothes
or
in
practising
the
steps
of
different
dances
harry
now
for
the
first
time
began
to
comprehend
the
infinite
importance
of
dress
even
the
elderly
ladies
seemed
to
be
as
much
interested
about
the
affair
as
their
daughters
and
instead
of
the
lessons
of
conduct
and
wisdom
which
he
expected
to
hear
nothing
seemed
to
employ
their
attention
a
moment
but
french
trimmings
gauzes
and
italian
flowers
miss
simmons
alone
appeared
to
consider
the
approaching
solemnity
with
perfect
indifference
harry
had
never
heard
a
single
word
drop
from
her
that
expressed
either
interest
or
impatience
but
he
had
for
some
days
observed
her
employed
in
her
room
with
more
than
common
assiduity
at
length
on
the
very
day
that
was
destined
for
this
important
exhibition
she
came
to
him
with
a
benevolent
smile
and
spoke
to
him
thus
i
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
account
you
gave
me
the
other
day
of
that
poor
young
woman
duty
and
affection
towards
her
parents
that
i
have
for
some
time
employed
myself
in
preparing
for
them
a
little
present
which
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
master
harry
to
convey
to
them
i
have
unfortunately
never
learned
either
to
embroider
or
to
paint
artificial
flowers
but
my
good
uncle
has
taught
me
that
the
best
employment
i
can
make
of
my
hands
is
to
assist
those
who
can
not
assist
themselves
saying
this
she
put
into
his
hands
a
parcel
that
contained
some
linen
and
other
necessaries
for
the
poor
old
people
and
bade
him
tell
them
not
to
forget
to
call
upon
her
uncle
when
she
was
returned
home
as
he
was
always
happy
to
assist
the
deserving
and
industrious
poor
harry
received
her
present
with
gratitude
and
almost
with
tears
of
joy
and
looking
up
in
her
face
imagined
that
he
saw
the
features
of
one
of
those
angels
which
he
had
read
of
in
the
scriptures
so
much
does
real
disinterested
benevolence
improve
the
expression
of
the
human
countenance
but
all
the
rest
of
the
young
gentry
were
employed
in
cares
of
a
very
different
nature
the
dressing
their
hair
and
adorning
their
persons
tommy
himself
had
now
completely
resumed
his
natural
character
and
thrown
aside
all
that
he
had
learned
during
his
residence
with
mr
barlow
he
had
contracted
an
infinite
fondness
for
all
those
scenes
of
dissipation
which
his
new
friends
daily
described
to
him
and
began
to
be
convinced
that
one
of
the
most
important
things
in
life
is
a
fashionable
dress
in
this
sentiment
he
had
been
confirmed
by
almost
all
the
ladies
with
whom
he
had
conversed
since
his
return
home
the
distinctions
of
character
relative
to
virtue
and
understanding
which
had
been
with
so
much
pains
inculcated
upon
his
mind
seemed
here
to
be
entirely
unheeded
no
one
took
the
trouble
of
examining
the
real
principles
or
motives
from
which
any
human
being
acted
while
the
most
minute
attention
was
continually
given
to
what
regarded
merely
the
outside
he
observed
that
the
omission
of
every
duty
towards
our
was
not
only
excused
but
even
to
a
certain
degree
admired
provided
it
was
joined
with
a
certain
fashionable
appearance
while
the
most
perfect
probity
or
integrity
was
mentioned
with
coldness
or
disgust
and
frequently
with
open
ridicule
if
unconnected
with
a
brilliant
appearance
as
to
all
the
common
virtues
of
life
such
as
industry
economy
a
punctuality
in
discharging
our
obligations
or
keeping
our
word
these
were
qualities
which
were
treated
as
fit
for
none
but
the
vulgar
mr
barlow
he
found
had
been
utterly
mistaken
in
all
the
principles
which
he
had
ever
inculcated
the
human
species
mr
barlow
used
to
say
can
only
be
supplied
with
food
and
necessaries
by
a
constant
assiduity
in
cultivating
the
earth
and
providing
for
their
mutual
wants
it
is
by
labour
that
everything
is
produced
without
labour
these
fertile
fields
which
are
now
adorned
with
all
the
luxuriance
of
plenty
would
be
converted
into
barren
heaths
or
impenetrable
thickets
these
meadows
now
the
support
of
a
thousand
herds
of
cattle
would
be
covered
with
stagnated
waters
that
would
not
only
render
them
uninhabitable
by
beasts
but
corrupt
the
air
with
pestilential
vapours
and
even
these
innumerable
flocks
of
sheep
that
feed
along
the
hills
would
disappear
immediately
on
the
cessation
of
that
cultivation
which
can
alone
support
them
and
secure
their
existence
but
however
true
might
be
these
principles
they
were
so
totally
inconsistent
with
the
conduct
and
opinion
of
tommy
new
friends
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
long
to
remember
their
force
he
had
been
nearly
a
month
with
a
few
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
his
own
rank
and
instead
of
their
being
brought
up
to
produce
anything
useful
he
found
that
the
great
object
of
all
their
knowledge
and
education
was
only
to
waste
to
consume
to
destroy
to
dissipate
what
was
produced
by
others
he
even
found
that
this
inability
to
assist
either
themselves
or
others
seemed
to
be
a
merit
upon
which
every
one
valued
himself
extremely
so
that
an
individual
who
could
not
exist
without
having
two
attendants
to
wait
upon
him
was
superior
to
him
that
had
only
one
but
was
obliged
in
turn
to
yield
to
another
who
required
four
and
indeed
this
new
system
seemed
much
more
easy
than
the
old
one
for
instead
of
giving
himself
any
trouble
about
his
manners
or
understanding
he
might
with
safety
indulge
all
his
caprices
give
way
to
all
his
passions
be
humoursome
haughty
unjust
and
selfish
to
the
extreme
he
might
be
ungrateful
to
his
friends
disobedient
to
his
parents
a
glutton
an
ignorant
blockhead
in
short
everything
which
to
plain
sense
appears
most
frivolous
or
contemptible
without
incurring
the
least
imputation
provided
his
hair
hung
fashionably
about
his
ears
his
buckles
were
sufficiently
large
and
his
politeness
to
the
ladies
unimpeached
once
indeed
harry
had
thrown
him
into
a
disagreeable
train
of
thinking
by
asking
him
with
great
simplicity
what
sort
of
a
figure
these
young
gentlemen
would
have
made
in
the
army
of
leonidas
or
these
young
ladies
upon
a
desert
island
where
they
would
be
obliged
to
shift
for
themselves
but
tommy
had
lately
learned
that
nothing
spoils
the
face
more
than
intense
reflection
and
therefore
as
he
could
not
easily
resolve
the
question
he
wisely
determined
to
forget
it
and
now
the
important
evening
of
the
ball
approached
the
largest
room
in
the
house
was
lighted
up
for
the
dancers
and
all
the
little
company
assembled
tommy
was
that
day
dressed
in
an
unusual
style
of
elegance
and
had
submitted
without
murmuring
to
be
under
the
hands
of
a
for
two
hours
but
what
gave
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
of
all
was
an
immense
pair
of
new
buckles
which
mrs
merton
had
sent
for
on
purpose
to
grace
the
person
of
her
son
several
minuets
were
first
danced
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
company
and
among
the
rest
tommy
who
had
been
practising
ever
since
he
had
been
at
home
had
the
honour
of
exhibiting
with
miss
matilda
he
indeed
began
with
a
certain
degree
of
diffidence
but
was
soon
inspired
with
a
proper
degree
of
confidence
by
the
applauses
which
resounded
on
every
side
what
an
elegant
little
creature
cried
one
lady
what
a
shape
is
there
said
a
second
i
protest
he
puts
me
in
mind
of
vestris
himself
indeed
said
a
third
mrs
merton
is
a
most
happy
mother
to
be
possessed
of
such
a
son
who
wants
nothing
but
an
introduction
to
the
world
to
be
one
of
the
most
elegant
creatures
in
england
and
the
most
accomplished
as
soon
as
tommy
had
finished
his
dance
he
led
his
partner
to
a
seat
with
a
grace
that
surprised
all
the
company
anew
and
then
with
the
sweetest
condescension
imaginable
he
went
from
one
lady
to
another
to
receive
the
praises
which
they
liberally
poured
out
as
if
it
was
the
greatest
action
in
the
world
to
draw
one
foot
behind
another
and
to
walk
on
tiptoe
harry
in
the
mean
time
had
shrouded
himself
in
the
most
obscure
part
of
the
room
and
was
silently
gazing
upon
the
scene
that
passed
he
knew
that
his
company
would
give
no
pleasure
among
the
elegant
figures
that
engrossed
the
foremost
seats
and
felt
not
the
least
inclination
for
such
an
honour
in
this
situation
he
was
observed
by
master
compton
who
at
the
same
instant
formed
a
scheme
of
mortifying
miss
simmons
whom
he
did
not
like
and
of
exposing
harry
to
the
general
ridicule
he
therefore
proposed
it
to
mash
who
had
partly
officiated
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
who
with
all
the
readiness
of
officious
malice
agreed
to
assist
him
master
mash
therefore
went
up
to
miss
simmons
and
with
all
the
solemnity
of
respect
invited
her
out
to
dance
which
she
although
indifferent
about
the
matter
accepted
without
hesitation
in
the
meantime
master
compton
went
up
to
harry
with
the
same
hypocritical
civility
and
in
miss
simmons
name
invited
him
to
dance
a
minuet
it
was
in
vain
that
harry
assured
him
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
his
perfidious
friend
told
him
that
it
was
an
indispensable
duty
for
him
to
stand
up
that
miss
simmons
would
never
forgive
him
if
he
should
refuse
that
it
would
be
sufficient
if
he
could
just
describe
the
figure
without
embarrassing
himself
about
the
steps
in
the
mean
time
he
pointed
out
miss
simmons
who
was
advancing
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
room
and
taking
advantage
of
his
confusion
and
embarrassment
led
him
forward
and
placed
him
by
the
young
lady
side
harry
was
not
yet
acquainted
with
the
sublime
science
of
imposing
upon
unwary
simplicity
and
therefore
never
doubted
that
the
message
had
come
from
his
friend
and
as
nothing
could
be
more
repugnant
to
his
character
than
the
want
of
compliance
he
thought
it
necessary
at
least
to
go
and
expostulate
with
her
upon
the
subject
this
was
his
intention
when
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
up
the
room
but
his
tormentors
did
not
give
him
time
for
they
placed
him
by
the
side
of
the
young
lady
and
instantly
called
to
the
music
to
begin
miss
simmons
in
her
turn
was
equally
surprised
at
the
partner
which
was
provided
for
her
she
had
never
imagined
minuet
dancing
to
be
one
of
harry
accomplishments
and
therefore
instantly
suspected
that
it
was
a
concerted
scheme
to
mortify
her
however
in
this
she
was
determined
they
should
be
disappointed
as
she
was
destitute
of
all
pride
and
had
the
sincerest
regard
for
harry
as
soon
therefore
as
the
music
struck
up
the
young
lady
began
her
reverence
which
harry
who
found
he
was
now
completely
caught
and
had
no
time
for
explanation
imitated
as
well
as
he
was
able
but
in
such
a
manner
as
set
the
whole
room
in
a
titter
harry
however
arming
himself
with
all
the
fortitude
he
possessed
performed
his
part
as
well
as
could
be
expected
from
a
person
that
had
never
learned
a
single
step
of
dancing
by
keeping
his
eye
fixed
upon
his
partner
he
made
a
shift
at
least
to
preserve
something
of
the
figure
although
he
was
terribly
deficient
in
the
steps
and
graces
of
the
dance
but
his
partner
who
was
scarcely
less
embarrassed
than
himself
and
wished
to
shorten
the
exhibition
after
crossing
once
presented
him
with
her
hand
harry
had
unfortunately
not
remarked
the
nature
of
this
manoeuvre
with
perfect
accuracy
and
therefore
imagining
that
one
hand
was
just
as
good
as
the
other
he
offered
the
young
lady
his
left
instead
of
his
right
hand
at
this
incident
a
universal
peal
of
merriment
which
they
no
longer
laboured
to
conceal
burst
from
almost
all
the
company
and
miss
simmons
wishing
at
any
rate
to
close
the
scene
presented
her
partner
with
both
her
hands
and
abruptly
finished
the
dance
the
unfortunate
couple
then
retreated
to
the
lower
end
of
the
room
amidst
the
jests
and
sneers
of
their
companions
particularly
mash
and
compton
who
assumed
unusual
importance
upon
the
credit
of
such
a
brilliant
invention
when
they
were
seated
miss
simmons
could
not
help
asking
harry
with
some
displeasure
why
he
had
thus
exposed
himself
and
her
by
attempting
what
he
was
totally
ignorant
of
and
added
that
though
there
was
no
disgrace
in
not
being
able
to
dance
it
was
very
great
folly
to
attempt
it
without
having
learned
a
single
step
indeed
madam
answered
harry
i
never
should
have
thought
of
trying
to
do
what
i
knew
i
was
totally
ignorant
of
but
master
compton
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
you
particularly
desired
me
to
dance
with
you
and
led
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
i
only
came
to
speak
to
you
and
to
inform
you
that
i
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
for
fear
you
should
think
me
uncivil
and
then
the
music
began
to
play
and
you
to
dance
so
that
i
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
and
i
thought
it
better
to
do
the
best
i
could
than
to
stand
still
or
leave
you
there
miss
simmons
instantly
recovered
her
former
and
said
well
harry
we
are
not
the
first
nor
shall
be
the
last
by
hundreds
who
have
made
a
ridiculous
figure
in
a
without
so
good
an
excuse
but
i
am
sorry
to
see
so
malicious
a
disposition
in
these
young
gentlemen
and
that
all
their
knowledge
of
polite
life
has
not
taught
them
a
little
better
manners
why
madam
answered
harry
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
talk
to
me
upon
the
subject
i
must
confess
that
i
have
been
very
much
surprised
at
many
things
i
have
seen
at
mr
merton
all
these
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
are
continually
talking
about
genteel
life
and
manners
and
yet
they
are
frequently
doing
things
which
surprise
me
mr
barlow
has
always
told
me
that
politeness
consisted
in
a
disposition
to
oblige
everybody
around
us
and
to
say
or
do
nothing
which
can
give
them
disagreeable
impressions
yet
i
continually
see
these
young
gentlemen
striving
to
do
and
say
things
for
no
other
reason
than
to
give
pain
for
not
to
go
any
farther
than
the
present
instance
what
motive
can
masters
compton
and
mash
have
had
but
to
mortify
you
by
giving
you
such
a
partner
you
madam
too
who
are
so
kind
and
good
to
everybody
that
i
should
think
it
impossible
not
to
love
you
harry
answered
the
young
lady
what
you
say
about
politeness
is
perfectly
just
i
have
heard
my
uncle
and
many
sensible
people
say
the
same
but
in
order
to
acquire
this
species
of
it
both
goodness
of
heart
and
a
just
way
of
thinking
are
required
and
therefore
many
people
content
themselves
with
aping
what
they
can
pick
up
in
the
dress
or
gestures
or
cant
expressions
of
the
higher
classes
just
like
the
poor
ass
which
dressed
in
the
skin
of
a
lion
was
taken
for
the
lion
himself
till
his
unfortunate
braying
exposed
the
cheat
pray
madam
what
is
that
story
said
harry
it
is
a
trifling
one
that
i
have
read
answered
miss
simmons
of
somebody
who
having
procured
a
lion
skin
fastened
it
round
the
body
of
an
ass
and
then
turned
him
loose
to
the
great
affright
of
the
neighbourhood
those
who
saw
him
first
imagined
that
a
monstrous
lion
had
invaded
the
country
and
fled
with
precipitation
even
the
very
cattle
caught
the
panic
and
were
scattered
by
hundreds
over
the
plains
in
the
meantime
the
victorious
ass
pranced
and
capered
along
the
fields
and
diverted
himself
with
running
after
the
fugitives
but
at
length
in
the
gaiety
of
his
heart
he
broke
into
such
a
discordant
braying
as
surprised
those
that
were
nearest
and
expected
to
hear
a
very
different
noise
from
under
the
terrible
skin
at
length
a
resolute
fellow
ventured
by
degrees
nearer
to
this
object
of
their
terror
and
discovering
the
cheat
that
had
been
practised
upon
them
divested
the
poor
ass
of
all
his
borrowed
spoils
and
drove
him
away
with
his
cudgel
this
story
continued
miss
simmons
is
continually
coming
into
my
mind
when
i
see
anybody
imagine
himself
of
great
importance
because
he
has
adopted
some
particular
mode
of
dress
or
the
grimaces
of
those
that
call
themselves
fashionable
people
nor
do
i
ever
see
master
mash
or
compton
without
thinking
of
the
lion
skin
and
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
them
bray
harry
laughed
very
heartily
at
this
story
but
now
their
attention
was
called
towards
the
company
who
had
ranged
themselves
by
pairs
for
miss
simmons
who
was
very
fond
of
this
exercise
then
asked
harry
if
he
had
never
practised
any
of
these
dances
harry
said
it
had
happened
to
him
three
or
four
times
at
home
and
that
he
believed
he
should
not
be
puzzled
about
any
of
the
figures
well
then
said
the
young
lady
to
show
how
little
i
regard
their
intended
mortification
i
will
stand
up
and
you
shall
be
my
partner
so
they
rose
and
placed
themselves
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
company
according
to
the
laws
of
dancing
which
appoint
that
place
for
those
who
come
last
and
now
the
music
began
to
strike
up
in
a
more
joyous
strain
the
little
dancers
exerted
themselves
with
all
their
activity
and
the
exercise
diffused
a
glow
of
health
and
cheerfulness
over
the
faces
of
the
most
pale
and
languid
harry
exerted
himself
here
with
much
better
success
than
he
had
lately
done
in
the
minuet
he
had
great
command
over
all
his
limbs
and
was
very
well
versed
in
every
play
that
gives
address
to
the
body
so
that
he
found
no
difficulty
in
practising
all
the
varied
figures
of
the
dances
particularly
with
the
assistance
of
miss
simmons
who
explained
to
him
everything
that
appeared
embarrassing
but
now
by
the
continuance
of
the
dance
all
who
were
at
first
at
the
upper
end
had
descended
to
the
bottom
where
by
the
laws
of
the
diversion
they
ought
to
have
waited
quietly
till
their
companions
becoming
in
their
turn
uppermost
had
danced
down
to
their
former
places
but
when
miss
simmons
and
harry
expected
to
have
had
their
just
share
of
the
exercise
they
found
that
almost
all
their
companions
had
deserted
them
and
retired
to
their
places
harry
could
not
help
wondering
at
this
behaviour
but
miss
simmons
told
him
with
a
smile
that
it
was
only
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
and
she
had
often
remarked
it
at
country
assemblies
where
all
the
gentry
of
a
county
were
gathered
together
this
is
frequently
the
way
added
she
that
those
who
think
themselves
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
world
choose
to
show
their
importance
this
is
a
very
bad
way
indeed
replied
harry
people
may
choose
whether
they
will
dance
or
practise
any
particular
diversion
but
if
they
do
they
ought
to
submit
to
the
laws
of
it
without
repining
and
i
have
always
observed
among
the
little
boys
whom
i
am
acquainted
with
that
wherever
this
disposition
prevails
it
is
the
greatest
proof
of
a
bad
and
contemptible
temper
i
am
afraid
replied
miss
simmons
that
your
observations
will
hold
universally
true
and
that
those
who
expect
so
much
for
themselves
without
being
willing
to
consider
their
in
turn
in
whatever
station
they
are
found
are
always
the
most
mean
ignorant
and
despicable
of
the
species
i
remember
said
harry
reading
a
story
of
a
great
man
called
sir
philip
sydney
this
gentleman
was
reckoned
not
only
the
bravest
but
the
politest
person
in
all
england
it
happened
that
he
was
sent
over
the
sea
to
assist
some
of
our
allies
against
their
enemies
after
having
distinguished
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
gained
him
the
love
and
esteem
of
all
the
army
this
excellent
man
one
day
received
a
shot
which
broke
his
thigh
as
he
was
bravely
fighting
at
the
head
of
his
men
sir
philip
sydney
felt
that
he
was
mortally
wounded
and
was
obliged
to
turn
his
horse
head
and
retire
to
his
tent
in
order
to
have
his
wound
examined
by
the
time
that
he
had
reached
his
tent
he
not
only
felt
great
agonies
from
his
wound
but
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
the
fever
which
the
pain
produced
had
excited
an
intolerable
thirst
so
that
he
prayed
his
attendants
to
fetch
him
a
little
water
with
infinite
difficulty
some
water
was
procured
and
brought
to
him
but
just
as
he
was
raising
the
cup
to
his
lips
he
chanced
to
see
a
poor
english
soldier
who
had
been
mortally
wounded
in
the
same
engagement
and
lay
upon
the
ground
faint
and
bleeding
and
ready
to
expire
the
poor
man
was
suffering
like
his
general
from
the
pain
of
a
consuming
thirst
and
therefore
though
respect
prevented
him
from
asking
for
any
he
turned
his
dying
eyes
upon
the
water
with
an
eagerness
which
sufficiently
explained
his
sufferings
upon
this
the
excellent
and
noble
gentleman
took
the
cup
which
he
had
not
yet
tasted
from
his
lips
and
gave
it
to
his
attendants
ordering
them
to
carry
it
to
the
wounded
soldier
and
only
saying
poor
man
wants
it
still
more
than
i
do
this
story
added
harry
was
always
a
particular
favourite
with
mr
barlow
and
he
has
often
pointed
it
out
to
me
as
an
example
not
only
of
the
greatest
virtue
and
humanity
but
also
of
that
elevated
method
of
thinking
which
constitutes
the
true
gentleman
what
is
it
i
have
heard
him
say
gives
a
superiority
of
manners
but
the
inclination
to
sacrifice
our
own
pleasures
and
interests
to
the
of
others
an
ordinary
person
might
have
pitied
the
poor
soldier
or
even
have
assisted
him
when
he
had
first
taken
care
of
himself
but
who
in
such
a
dreadful
extremity
as
the
brave
sydney
was
reduced
to
would
be
capable
of
even
forgetting
his
own
sufferings
to
relieve
another
who
had
not
acquired
the
generous
habit
of
always
slighting
his
own
gratifications
for
the
sake
of
his
as
harry
was
conversing
in
this
manner
the
little
company
had
left
off
dancing
and
were
refreshing
themselves
with
a
variety
of
cakes
and
agreeable
liquors
which
had
been
provided
for
the
occasion
tommy
merton
and
the
other
young
gentleman
were
now
distinguishing
themselves
by
their
attendance
upon
the
ladies
whom
they
were
supplying
with
everything
they
chose
to
have
but
no
one
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
wait
upon
miss
simmons
when
harry
observed
this
he
ran
to
the
table
and
upon
a
large
waiter
brought
her
cakes
and
lemonade
which
he
presented
if
not
with
a
better
grace
with
a
more
sincere
desire
to
oblige
than
any
of
the
rest
but
as
he
was
stooping
down
to
offer
her
the
choice
master
mash
unluckily
passed
that
way
and
elated
by
the
success
of
his
late
piece
of
determined
to
attempt
a
second
still
more
brutal
than
the
first
for
this
reason
just
as
miss
simmons
was
helping
herself
to
some
wine
and
water
mash
pretending
to
stumble
pushed
harry
in
such
a
manner
that
the
greater
part
of
the
contents
of
the
glasses
was
discharged
full
into
her
bosom
the
young
lady
coloured
at
the
insult
and
harry
who
instantly
perceived
that
it
had
been
done
on
purpose
being
no
longer
able
to
contain
his
indignation
seized
a
glass
that
was
only
and
discharged
the
contents
full
into
the
face
of
the
aggressor
mash
who
was
a
boy
of
violent
passion
exasperated
at
this
retaliation
which
he
so
well
deserved
instantly
caught
up
a
drinking
glass
and
flung
it
full
at
the
head
of
harry
happy
was
it
for
him
that
it
only
grazed
his
head
without
taking
the
full
effect
it
however
laid
bare
a
considerable
gash
and
harry
was
in
an
instant
covered
with
his
own
blood
the
sight
of
which
provoked
him
the
more
and
made
him
forget
both
the
place
and
the
company
where
he
was
so
that
flying
upon
mash
with
all
the
fury
of
just
revenge
a
dreadful
combat
ensued
which
put
the
whole
room
in
a
consternation
but
mr
merton
soon
appeared
and
with
some
difficulty
separated
the
enraged
champions
he
then
inquired
into
the
subject
of
the
contest
which
master
mash
endeavoured
to
explain
away
as
an
accident
but
harry
persisted
in
his
account
with
so
much
firmness
in
which
he
was
corroborated
by
miss
simmons
that
mr
merton
readily
perceived
the
truth
mash
however
apologised
for
himself
in
the
best
manner
that
he
was
able
by
saying
that
he
only
meant
to
play
master
harry
an
innocent
trick
but
that
he
had
undesignedly
injured
miss
simmons
whatever
mr
merton
felt
he
did
not
say
a
great
deal
he
however
endeavoured
to
pacify
the
enraged
combatants
and
ordered
assistance
to
harry
to
bind
up
the
wound
and
clean
him
from
the
blood
which
had
now
disfigured
him
from
head
to
foot
mrs
merton
in
the
mean
time
who
was
sitting
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
amidst
the
other
ladies
had
seen
the
fray
and
been
informed
that
it
was
owing
to
harry
throwing
a
glass
of
lemonade
in
master
face
this
gave
mrs
compton
an
opportunity
of
indulging
herself
again
in
long
invectives
against
harry
his
breeding
family
and
manners
she
never
she
said
had
liked
the
boy
and
now
he
had
justified
all
her
forebodings
upon
the
subject
such
a
little
vulgar
wretch
could
never
have
been
witness
to
anything
but
scenes
of
riot
and
and
now
he
was
brawling
and
fighting
in
a
gentleman
house
just
as
he
would
do
at
one
of
the
public
houses
to
which
he
was
used
to
go
with
his
father
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
this
eloquent
harangue
mr
merton
came
up
and
gave
a
more
unprejudiced
narrative
of
the
affair
he
acquitted
harry
of
all
blame
and
said
that
it
was
impossible
even
for
the
mildest
temper
in
the
world
to
act
otherwise
upon
such
unmerited
provocation
this
account
seemed
wonderfully
to
turn
the
scale
in
harry
favour
though
miss
simmons
was
no
great
favourite
with
the
young
ladies
yet
the
spirit
and
gallantry
which
he
had
discovered
in
her
cause
began
to
act
very
forcibly
on
their
minds
one
of
the
young
ladies
observed
that
if
master
harry
was
better
dressed
he
would
certainly
be
a
very
pretty
boy
another
said
she
had
always
thought
he
had
a
look
above
his
station
and
a
third
remarked
that
considering
he
had
never
learned
to
dance
he
had
by
no
means
a
vulgar
look
this
untoward
accident
having
thus
been
amicably
settled
the
diversions
of
the
evening
went
forward
but
harry
who
had
now
lost
all
taste
for
genteel
company
took
the
first
opportunity
of
retiring
to
bed
where
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
both
the
mortification
and
bruises
he
had
received
in
the
mean
time
the
little
company
below
found
means
to
entertain
themselves
till
past
midnight
and
then
retired
to
their
chambers
the
next
morning
they
rose
later
than
usual
and
as
several
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
had
been
invited
to
the
preceding
diversion
were
not
to
return
till
after
dinner
they
agreed
to
take
a
walk
into
the
country
harry
went
with
them
as
usual
though
master
mash
by
his
misrepresentations
had
prejudiced
tommy
and
all
the
rest
against
him
but
harry
who
was
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
and
began
to
feel
the
pride
of
injured
friendship
disdained
to
give
an
explanation
of
his
behaviour
since
his
friend
was
not
sufficiently
interested
about
the
matter
to
demand
one
while
they
were
walking
slowly
along
the
common
they
discovered
at
a
distance
a
prodigious
crowd
of
people
all
moving
forward
in
the
same
direction
this
attracted
the
curiosity
of
the
little
troop
and
on
inquiry
they
found
there
was
going
to
be
a
instantly
an
eager
desire
seized
upon
all
the
little
gentry
to
see
the
diversion
one
obstacle
alone
presented
itself
which
was
that
their
parents
and
particularly
mrs
merton
had
made
them
promise
that
they
would
avoid
every
species
of
danger
this
objection
was
however
removed
by
master
billy
lyddall
who
remarked
that
there
could
be
no
danger
in
the
sight
as
the
bull
was
to
be
tied
fast
and
could
therefore
do
them
no
harm
besides
added
he
smiling
what
occasion
have
they
to
know
that
we
have
been
at
all
i
hope
we
are
not
such
simpletons
as
to
accuse
ourselves
or
such
telltales
as
to
inform
against
one
another
no
no
no
was
the
universal
exclamation
from
all
but
harry
who
had
remained
profoundly
silent
on
the
occasion
master
harry
has
not
said
a
word
said
one
of
the
little
folks
sure
he
will
not
tell
of
us
indeed
said
harry
i
do
wish
to
tell
of
you
but
if
i
am
asked
where
we
have
been
how
can
i
help
telling
what
answered
master
lyddall
ca
you
say
that
we
have
been
walking
along
the
road
or
across
the
common
without
mentioning
anything
further
no
said
harry
that
would
not
be
speaking
truth
besides
is
a
very
cruel
and
dangerous
diversion
and
therefore
none
of
us
should
go
to
see
it
particularly
master
merton
whose
mother
loves
him
so
much
and
is
so
careful
about
him
this
speech
was
not
received
with
much
approbation
by
those
to
whom
it
was
addressed
a
pretty
fellow
said
one
to
give
himself
these
airs
and
pretend
to
be
wiser
than
every
one
else
what
said
master
compton
does
this
beggar
brat
think
that
he
is
to
govern
gentlemen
sons
because
master
merton
is
so
good
as
to
keep
company
with
him
if
i
were
master
merton
said
a
third
i
soon
send
the
little
impertinent
jackanapes
home
to
his
own
blackguard
family
and
master
mash
who
was
the
biggest
and
strongest
boy
in
the
whole
company
came
up
to
harry
and
grinning
in
his
face
said
so
all
the
return
that
you
make
to
master
merton
for
his
goodness
to
you
is
to
be
a
spy
and
an
informer
is
it
you
little
dirty
blackguard
harry
who
had
long
perceived
and
lamented
the
coolness
of
master
merton
towards
him
was
now
much
more
grieved
to
see
that
his
friend
was
not
only
silent
but
seemed
to
take
an
pleasure
in
these
insults
than
at
the
insults
themselves
which
were
offered
to
him
however
as
soon
as
the
crowd
of
tormentors
which
surrounded
him
would
give
him
leave
to
speak
he
coolly
answered
that
he
was
as
little
a
spy
and
informer
as
any
of
them
and
as
to
begging
he
thanked
god
he
wanted
as
little
of
them
as
they
did
of
him
besides
added
he
were
i
even
reduced
so
low
as
that
i
should
know
better
how
to
employ
my
time
than
to
ask
charity
of
any
one
here
this
sarcastic
answer
and
the
reflections
that
were
made
upon
it
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
too
irritable
temper
of
master
merton
that
in
an
instant
forgetting
his
former
obligations
and
affection
to
harry
he
strutted
up
to
him
and
clenching
his
fist
asked
him
whether
he
meant
to
insult
him
well
done
master
merton
echoed
through
the
whole
society
thrash
him
heartily
for
his
impudence
no
master
tommy
answered
harry
it
is
you
and
your
friends
here
that
insult
me
what
answered
tommy
are
you
a
person
of
such
consequence
that
you
must
not
be
spoken
to
you
are
a
prodigious
fine
gentleman
indeed
i
always
thought
you
one
till
now
answered
harry
how
you
rascal
said
tommy
do
you
say
that
i
am
not
a
gentleman
take
that
and
immediately
struck
harry
upon
the
face
with
his
fist
his
fortitude
was
not
proof
against
this
treatment
he
turned
his
face
away
and
only
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
master
tommy
master
tommy
i
never
should
have
thought
it
possible
you
could
have
treated
me
in
this
unworthy
manner
then
covering
his
face
with
both
his
hands
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
crying
but
the
little
troop
of
gentlemen
who
were
vastly
delighted
with
the
mortification
which
harry
had
received
and
had
formed
a
very
different
opinion
of
his
prowess
from
the
patience
which
he
had
hitherto
exerted
began
to
gather
round
and
repeat
their
persecutions
and
and
echoed
in
a
chorus
through
the
circle
and
some
more
forward
than
the
rest
seized
him
by
the
hair
in
order
that
he
might
hold
up
his
head
and
show
his
but
harry
who
now
began
to
recollect
himself
wiped
his
tears
with
his
hand
and
looking
up
asked
them
with
a
firm
tone
of
voice
and
a
steady
countenance
why
they
meddled
with
him
then
swinging
round
he
disengaged
himself
at
once
from
all
who
had
taken
hold
of
him
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
gave
back
at
this
question
and
seemed
disposed
to
leave
him
unmolested
but
master
mash
who
was
the
most
quarrelsome
and
impertinent
boy
present
advanced
and
looking
at
harry
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
said
this
is
the
way
we
always
treat
such
little
blackguards
as
you
and
if
you
have
not
had
enough
to
satisfy
you
we
willingly
give
you
some
more
as
to
all
your
nicknames
and
nonsense
answered
harry
i
do
think
it
worth
my
while
to
resent
them
but
though
i
have
suffered
master
merton
to
strike
me
there
not
another
in
the
company
shall
do
it
or
if
he
chooses
to
try
he
shall
soon
find
whether
or
not
i
am
a
coward
master
mash
made
no
answer
to
this
but
by
a
slap
of
the
face
which
harry
returned
by
a
punch
of
his
fist
which
had
almost
overset
his
antagonist
in
spite
of
his
superiority
of
size
and
strength
this
unexpected
check
from
a
boy
so
much
less
than
himself
might
probably
have
cooled
the
courage
of
mash
had
he
not
been
ashamed
of
yielding
to
one
whom
he
had
treated
with
so
much
unmerited
contempt
summoning
therefore
all
his
resolution
he
flew
at
harry
like
a
fury
and
as
he
had
often
been
engaged
in
quarrels
like
this
he
struck
him
with
so
much
force
that
with
the
first
blow
he
aimed
he
felled
him
to
the
ground
harry
foiled
in
this
manner
but
not
dismayed
rose
in
an
instant
and
attacked
his
adversary
with
redoubled
vigour
at
the
very
moment
when
he
thought
himself
sure
of
the
victory
a
second
time
did
mash
after
a
short
but
severe
contest
close
with
his
undaunted
enemy
and
by
dint
of
superior
strength
roughly
hurled
him
to
the
ground
the
little
troop
of
spectators
who
had
mistaken
harry
patient
fortitude
for
cowardice
began
now
to
entertain
the
sincerest
respect
for
his
courage
and
gathered
round
the
combatants
in
silence
a
second
time
did
harry
rise
and
attack
his
stronger
adversary
with
the
cool
intrepidity
of
a
veteran
combatant
the
battle
now
began
to
grow
more
dreadful
and
more
violent
mash
had
superior
strength
and
dexterity
and
greater
habitude
of
fighting
his
blows
were
aimed
with
equal
skill
and
force
and
each
appeared
sufficient
to
crush
an
enemy
so
much
inferior
in
size
in
strength
in
years
but
harry
possessed
a
body
hardened
to
support
pain
and
hardship
a
greater
degree
of
activity
a
cool
unyielding
courage
which
nothing
could
disturb
or
daunt
four
times
had
he
been
now
thrown
down
by
the
irresistible
strength
of
his
foe
four
times
had
he
risen
stronger
from
his
fall
covered
with
dirt
and
blood
and
panting
with
fatigue
but
still
unconquered
at
length
from
the
duration
of
the
combat
and
his
own
violent
exertions
the
strength
of
mash
began
to
fail
enraged
and
disappointed
at
the
obstinate
resistance
he
had
met
with
he
began
to
lose
all
command
of
his
temper
and
strike
at
random
his
breath
grew
short
his
efforts
were
more
laborious
and
his
knees
seemed
scarcely
able
to
sustain
his
weight
but
actuated
by
rage
and
shame
he
rushed
with
all
his
might
upon
harry
as
if
determined
to
crush
him
with
one
last
effort
harry
prudently
stepped
back
and
contented
himself
with
parrying
the
blows
that
were
aimed
at
him
till
seeing
that
his
antagonist
was
almost
exhausted
by
his
own
impetuosity
he
darted
at
him
with
all
his
force
and
by
one
successful
blow
levelled
him
with
the
ground
an
involuntary
shout
of
triumph
now
burst
from
the
little
assembly
of
spectators
for
such
is
the
temper
of
human
beings
that
they
are
more
inclined
to
consider
superiority
of
force
than
justice
and
the
very
same
boys
who
just
before
were
loading
harry
with
taunts
and
outrages
were
now
ready
to
congratulate
him
upon
his
victory
he
however
when
he
found
his
antagonist
no
longer
capable
of
resistance
kindly
assisted
him
to
rise
and
told
him
he
was
very
sorry
for
what
had
happened
but
mash
oppressed
at
once
with
the
pain
of
his
bruises
and
the
disgrace
of
his
defeat
observed
an
obstinate
silence
just
at
this
moment
their
attention
was
engaged
by
a
new
and
sudden
spectacle
a
bull
of
the
largest
size
and
greatest
beauty
was
led
across
the
plain
adorned
with
ribbons
of
various
colours
the
majestic
animal
suffered
himself
to
be
led
along
an
unresisting
prey
till
he
arrived
at
the
spot
which
was
destined
for
the
theatre
of
his
persecutions
here
he
was
fastened
to
an
iron
ring
which
had
been
strongly
let
into
the
ground
and
whose
force
they
imagined
would
be
sufficient
to
restrain
him
even
in
the
midst
of
his
most
violent
exertions
an
innumerable
crowd
of
men
of
women
of
children
then
surrounded
the
place
waiting
with
eager
curiosity
for
the
inhuman
sport
which
they
expected
the
little
party
which
had
accompanied
master
merton
were
now
no
longer
to
be
restrained
their
friends
their
parents
admonition
duty
promises
were
all
forgotten
in
an
instant
and
solely
intent
upon
gratifying
their
curiosity
they
mingled
with
the
surrounding
multitude
harry
although
reluctantly
followed
them
at
a
distance
neither
the
he
had
received
nor
the
pain
of
his
wounds
could
make
him
unmindful
of
master
merton
or
careless
of
his
safety
he
knew
too
well
the
dreadful
accidents
which
frequently
attend
these
barbarous
sports
to
be
able
to
quit
his
friend
till
he
had
once
more
seen
him
in
a
place
of
safety
and
now
the
noble
animal
that
was
to
be
thus
wantonly
tormented
was
fastened
to
the
ring
by
a
cord
which
though
it
confined
and
cramped
his
exertions
did
not
entirely
restrain
them
although
possessed
of
almost
irresistible
strength
he
seemed
unwilling
to
exert
it
and
looked
round
upon
the
infinite
multitude
of
his
enemies
with
a
gentleness
that
ought
to
have
disarmed
their
animosity
presently
a
dog
of
the
largest
size
and
most
ferocious
courage
was
let
loose
who
as
soon
as
he
beheld
the
bull
uttered
a
savage
yell
and
rushed
upon
him
with
all
the
rage
of
inveterate
animosity
the
bull
suffered
him
to
approach
with
the
coolness
of
deliberate
courage
but
just
as
the
dog
was
springing
up
to
seize
him
he
rushed
forward
to
meet
his
foe
and
putting
his
head
to
the
ground
canted
him
into
the
air
several
yards
and
had
not
the
spectators
run
and
caught
him
upon
their
backs
and
hands
he
would
have
been
crushed
to
pieces
in
the
fall
the
same
fate
attended
another
and
another
dog
which
were
let
loose
successively
the
one
was
killed
upon
the
spot
while
the
other
who
had
a
leg
broken
in
the
fall
crawled
howling
and
limping
away
the
bull
in
the
meanwhile
behaved
with
all
the
calmness
and
intrepidity
of
an
experienced
warrior
without
violence
without
passion
he
waited
every
attack
of
his
enemies
and
then
severely
punished
them
for
their
rashness
while
this
was
transacting
to
the
diversion
not
only
of
the
rude
and
illiterate
populace
but
to
that
of
the
little
gentry
with
master
merton
a
poor
black
came
up
and
humbly
implored
their
charity
he
had
served
he
told
them
on
board
an
english
vessel
and
even
showed
them
the
scars
of
several
wounds
he
had
received
but
now
he
was
discharged
and
without
friends
and
without
assistance
he
could
scarcely
find
food
to
support
his
wretched
life
or
clothes
to
cover
him
from
the
wintry
wind
some
of
the
young
gentry
who
from
a
bad
education
had
been
little
taught
to
feel
or
pity
the
distress
of
others
were
base
enough
to
attempt
to
jest
upon
his
dusky
colour
and
foreign
accent
but
master
merton
who
though
lately
much
corrupted
and
changed
from
what
he
had
been
with
mr
barlow
preserved
a
great
degree
of
generosity
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
in
order
to
relieve
him
but
unfortunately
found
nothing
to
give
the
foolish
profusion
which
he
had
lately
learned
from
the
young
gentlemen
at
his
father
house
had
made
him
waste
in
cards
in
playthings
in
trifles
all
his
stock
of
money
and
now
he
found
himself
unable
to
relieve
that
distress
which
he
pitied
thus
repulsed
on
every
side
and
unassisted
the
unfortunate
black
approached
the
place
where
harry
stood
holding
out
the
tattered
remains
of
his
hat
and
imploring
charity
harry
had
not
much
to
give
but
he
took
sixpence
out
of
his
pocket
which
was
all
his
riches
and
gave
it
with
the
kindest
look
of
compassion
saying
here
poor
man
this
is
all
i
have
if
i
had
more
it
should
be
at
your
service
he
had
no
time
to
add
more
for
at
that
instant
three
fierce
dogs
rushed
upon
the
bull
at
once
and
by
their
joint
attacks
rendered
him
almost
mad
the
calm
deliberate
courage
which
he
had
hitherto
shown
was
now
changed
into
rage
and
desperation
he
roared
with
pain
and
fury
flashes
of
fire
seemed
to
come
from
his
angry
eyes
and
his
mouth
was
covered
with
foam
and
blood
he
hurried
round
the
stake
with
incessant
toil
and
rage
first
aiming
at
one
then
at
another
of
the
persecuting
dogs
that
harassed
him
on
every
side
growling
and
baying
incessantly
and
biting
him
in
every
part
at
length
with
a
furious
effort
that
he
made
he
trampled
one
of
his
foes
beneath
his
feet
and
gored
a
second
to
that
degree
that
his
bowels
came
through
the
wound
and
at
the
same
moment
the
cord
which
had
hitherto
confined
him
snapped
asunder
and
let
him
loose
upon
the
affrighted
multitude
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
terror
and
dismay
which
instantly
seized
the
crowd
of
spectators
those
who
before
had
been
hallooing
with
joy
and
encouraging
the
fury
of
the
dogs
with
shouts
and
acclamations
were
now
scattered
over
the
plain
and
fled
from
the
fury
of
the
animal
whom
they
had
been
so
basely
tormenting
the
enraged
bull
meanwhile
rushed
like
lightning
over
the
plain
trampling
some
goring
others
and
taking
ample
vengeance
for
the
injuries
he
had
received
presently
he
rushed
with
headlong
fury
towards
the
spot
where
master
merton
and
his
associates
stood
all
fled
with
wild
affright
but
with
a
speed
that
was
not
equal
to
that
of
the
pursuer
shrieks
and
outcries
and
lamentations
were
heard
on
every
side
and
those
who
a
few
minutes
before
had
despised
the
good
advice
of
harry
would
now
have
given
the
world
to
be
safe
in
the
houses
of
their
parents
harry
alone
seemed
to
preserve
his
presence
of
mind
he
neither
cried
out
nor
ran
but
when
the
dreadful
animal
approached
leaped
nimbly
aside
and
the
bull
passed
on
without
embarrassing
himself
about
his
escape
not
so
fortunate
was
master
merton
he
happened
to
be
the
last
of
the
little
troop
of
fliers
and
full
in
the
way
which
the
bull
had
taken
and
now
his
destruction
appeared
certain
for
as
he
ran
whether
through
fear
or
the
inequality
of
the
ground
his
foot
slipped
and
down
he
tumbled
in
the
very
path
of
the
enraged
pursuing
animal
all
who
saw
imagined
his
fate
inevitable
and
it
would
certainly
have
proved
so
had
not
harry
with
a
courage
and
presence
of
mind
above
his
years
suddenly
seized
a
prong
which
one
of
the
fugitives
had
dropped
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
bull
was
stooping
to
gore
his
defenceless
friend
advanced
and
wounded
him
in
the
flank
the
bull
in
an
instant
turned
short
and
with
redoubled
rage
made
at
his
new
assailant
and
it
is
probable
that
notwithstanding
his
intrepidity
harry
would
have
paid
the
price
of
his
assistance
to
his
friend
with
his
own
life
had
not
an
unexpected
succour
arrived
for
in
that
instant
the
grateful
black
rushed
on
like
lightning
to
assist
him
and
assailing
the
bull
with
a
weighty
stick
that
he
held
in
his
hand
compelled
him
to
turn
his
rage
upon
a
new
object
the
bull
indeed
attacked
him
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
revenge
but
the
black
jumped
nimbly
aside
and
eluded
his
fury
not
contented
with
this
he
wheeled
round
his
fierce
antagonist
and
seizing
him
by
the
tail
began
to
batter
his
sides
with
an
unexpected
storm
of
blows
in
vain
did
the
enraged
animal
bellow
and
writhe
himself
about
in
all
the
convulsions
of
madness
his
intrepid
foe
without
ever
quitting
his
hold
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
about
the
field
still
continuing
his
discipline
till
the
creature
was
almost
spent
with
the
fatigue
of
his
own
violent
agitations
and
now
some
of
the
boldest
of
the
spectators
taking
courage
approached
to
his
assistance
and
throwing
a
rope
over
his
head
they
at
length
by
the
dint
of
superior
numbers
completely
mastered
the
furious
animal
and
bound
him
to
a
tree
in
the
meanwhile
several
of
mr
merton
servants
who
had
been
sent
out
after
the
young
gentlemen
approached
and
took
up
their
young
master
who
though
without
a
wound
was
almost
dead
with
fear
and
agitation
but
harry
after
seeing
that
his
friend
was
perfectly
safe
and
in
the
hands
of
his
own
family
invited
the
black
to
accompany
him
and
instead
of
returning
to
mr
merton
took
the
way
which
led
to
his
house
while
these
scenes
were
passing
mrs
merton
though
ignorant
of
the
danger
of
her
son
was
not
undisturbed
at
home
some
accounts
had
been
brought
of
harry
combat
which
served
to
make
her
uneasy
and
to
influence
her
still
more
against
him
mrs
compton
too
and
miss
matilda
who
had
conceived
a
violent
dislike
to
harry
were
busy
to
inflame
her
by
their
malicious
representations
while
she
was
in
these
dispositions
mr
merton
happened
to
enter
and
was
at
once
attacked
by
all
the
ladies
upon
the
subject
of
this
improper
connection
he
endeavoured
for
a
long
time
to
remove
their
prejudices
by
reason
but
when
he
found
that
to
be
impossible
he
contented
himself
with
telling
his
wife
that
a
little
time
would
perhaps
decide
which
were
the
most
proper
companions
for
their
son
and
that
till
harry
had
done
something
to
render
himself
unworthy
of
their
notice
he
never
could
consent
to
their
treating
him
with
coldness
or
neglect
at
this
moment
a
female
servant
burst
into
the
room
with
all
the
wildness
of
affright
and
cried
out
with
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
articulate
oh
madam
madam
such
an
accident
poor
dear
master
tommy
what
of
him
for
pity
sake
cried
out
mrs
merton
with
an
impatience
and
concern
that
sufficiently
marked
her
feelings
nay
madam
answered
the
servant
he
is
not
much
hurt
they
say
but
little
sandford
has
taken
him
to
a
and
the
bull
has
gored
him
and
william
and
john
are
bringing
him
home
in
their
arms
these
words
were
scarcely
delivered
when
mrs
merton
uttered
a
violent
shriek
and
was
instantly
seized
with
an
hysteric
fit
and
while
the
ladies
were
all
employed
in
assisting
her
and
restoring
her
senses
mr
merton
who
though
much
alarmed
was
more
composed
walked
precipitately
out
to
learn
the
truth
of
this
imperfect
narration
he
had
not
proceeded
far
before
he
met
the
crowd
of
children
and
servants
one
of
whom
carried
tommy
merton
in
his
arms
as
soon
as
he
was
convinced
that
his
son
had
received
no
other
damage
than
a
violent
fright
he
began
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
of
the
affair
but
before
he
had
time
to
receive
any
information
mrs
merton
who
had
recovered
from
her
fainting
came
running
wildly
from
the
house
when
she
saw
that
her
son
was
safe
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
began
to
utter
all
the
incoherent
expressions
of
a
mother
fondness
it
was
with
difficulty
that
her
husband
could
prevail
upon
her
to
moderate
her
transports
till
they
were
within
then
she
gave
a
loose
to
her
feelings
in
all
their
violence
and
for
a
considerable
time
was
incapable
of
attending
to
anything
but
the
joy
of
his
miraculous
preservation
at
length
however
she
became
more
composed
and
observing
that
all
the
company
were
present
except
harry
sandford
she
exclaimed
with
sudden
indignation
so
i
see
that
little
abominable
wretch
has
not
had
the
impudence
to
follow
you
in
and
i
almost
wish
that
the
bull
had
gored
him
as
he
deserved
what
little
wretch
do
you
mean
mamma
said
tommy
whom
can
i
mean
cried
mrs
merton
but
that
vile
harry
sandford
whom
your
father
is
so
fond
of
and
who
had
nearly
cost
you
your
life
by
leading
you
into
danger
he
mamma
said
tommy
he
lead
me
into
danger
he
did
all
he
could
to
persuade
me
not
to
go
and
i
was
a
very
naughty
boy
indeed
not
to
take
his
advice
mrs
merton
stood
amazed
at
this
information
for
her
prejudices
had
operated
so
powerfully
upon
her
mind
that
she
had
implicitly
believed
the
guilt
of
harry
upon
the
imperfect
evidence
of
the
maid
who
was
it
then
said
mr
merton
could
be
so
imprudent
indeed
papa
answered
tommy
we
were
all
to
blame
all
but
harry
who
advised
and
begged
us
not
to
go
and
particularly
me
because
he
said
it
would
give
you
so
much
uneasiness
when
you
knew
it
and
that
it
was
so
dangerous
a
diversion
mrs
merton
looked
confused
at
her
mistake
but
mrs
compton
observed
that
she
supposed
harry
was
afraid
of
the
danger
and
therefore
had
wisely
kept
out
of
the
way
oh
no
indeed
madam
answered
one
of
the
little
boys
harry
is
no
coward
though
we
thought
him
so
at
first
when
he
let
master
tommy
strike
him
but
he
fought
master
mash
in
the
bravest
manner
i
ever
saw
and
though
master
mash
fought
very
well
yet
harry
had
the
advantage
and
i
saw
him
follow
us
at
a
little
distance
and
keep
his
eye
upon
master
merton
all
the
time
till
the
bull
broke
loose
and
then
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
do
not
know
what
became
of
him
so
this
is
the
little
boy
said
mr
merton
whom
you
were
for
driving
from
the
society
of
your
children
but
let
us
hear
more
of
this
story
for
as
yet
i
know
neither
the
particulars
of
his
danger
nor
his
escape
upon
this
one
of
the
servants
who
from
some
little
distance
had
seen
the
whole
affair
was
called
in
and
examined
he
gave
them
an
exact
account
of
all
of
tommy
misfortune
of
harry
bravery
of
the
unexpected
succour
of
the
poor
black
and
filled
the
whole
room
with
admiration
that
such
an
action
so
noble
so
intrepid
so
fortunate
should
have
been
achieved
by
such
a
child
mrs
merton
was
now
silent
with
shame
at
reflecting
upon
her
own
unjust
prejudices
and
the
ease
with
which
she
had
become
the
enemy
of
a
boy
who
had
saved
the
life
of
her
darling
son
and
who
appeared
as
much
superior
in
character
to
all
the
young
gentlemen
at
her
house
as
they
exceeded
him
in
rank
and
fortune
the
young
ladies
now
forgot
their
former
objections
to
his
person
and
manners
and
such
is
the
effect
of
genuine
virtue
all
the
company
conspired
to
extol
the
conduct
of
harry
to
the
skies
but
mr
merton
who
had
appeared
more
delighted
than
all
the
rest
with
the
relations
of
harry
intrepidity
now
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
his
little
friend
but
when
he
could
not
find
him
he
said
with
some
concern
where
can
be
our
little
deliverer
sure
he
can
have
met
with
no
accident
that
he
has
not
returned
with
the
rest
no
said
one
of
the
servants
as
to
that
harry
sandford
is
safe
enough
for
i
saw
him
go
towards
his
own
home
in
company
with
the
black
alas
answered
mr
merton
surely
he
must
have
received
some
unworthy
treatment
that
could
make
him
thus
abruptly
desert
us
all
and
now
i
recollect
i
heard
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
mention
a
blow
that
harry
had
received
surely
tommy
you
could
not
have
been
so
basely
ungrateful
as
to
strike
the
best
and
noblest
of
your
friends
tommy
at
this
hung
down
his
head
his
face
was
covered
with
a
burning
blush
and
the
tears
began
silently
to
trickle
down
his
cheeks
mrs
merton
remarked
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
her
child
and
catching
him
in
her
arms
was
going
to
clasp
him
to
her
bosom
with
the
most
endearing
expressions
but
mr
merton
hastily
interrupting
her
said
it
is
not
now
a
time
to
give
way
to
fondness
for
a
child
who
i
fear
has
acted
the
basest
and
vilest
part
that
can
disgrace
a
human
being
and
who
if
what
i
suspect
be
true
can
be
only
a
dishonour
to
his
parents
at
this
tommy
could
no
longer
contain
himself
but
burst
into
such
a
violent
transport
of
crying
that
mrs
merton
who
seemed
to
feel
the
severity
of
mr
merton
conduct
with
still
more
poignancy
than
her
son
caught
her
darling
up
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
abruptly
out
of
the
room
accompanied
by
most
of
the
ladies
who
pitied
abasement
and
agreed
that
there
was
no
crime
he
could
have
been
guilty
of
which
was
not
amply
atoned
for
by
such
charming
sensibility
but
mr
merton
who
now
felt
all
the
painful
interest
of
a
tender
father
and
considered
this
as
the
critical
moment
which
was
to
give
his
son
the
impression
of
worth
or
baseness
for
life
was
determined
to
examine
this
affair
to
the
utmost
he
therefore
took
the
first
opportunity
of
drawing
the
little
boy
aside
who
had
mentioned
master
merton
striking
harry
and
questioned
him
upon
the
subject
but
he
who
had
no
particular
interest
in
disguising
the
truth
related
the
circumstances
nearly
as
they
had
happened
and
though
he
a
little
softened
the
matter
in
tommy
favour
yet
without
intending
it
he
held
up
such
a
picture
of
his
violence
and
injustice
as
wounded
his
father
to
the
soul

to

the
unexpected

conclusion
while
mr
merton
was
occupied
by
these
uneasy
feelings
he
was
agreeably
surprised
by
a
visit
from
mr
barlow
who
came
accidentally
to
see
him
with
a
perfect
ignorance
of
all
the
great
events
which
had
so
recently
happened
mr
merton
received
this
worthy
man
with
the
sincerest
cordiality
but
there
was
such
a
gloom
diffused
over
all
his
manners
that
mr
barlow
began
to
suspect
that
all
was
not
right
with
tommy
and
therefore
purposely
inquired
after
him
to
give
his
father
an
opportunity
of
speaking
this
mr
merton
did
not
fail
to
do
and
taking
mr
barlow
affectionately
by
the
hand
he
said
oh
my
dear
sir
i
begin
to
fear
that
all
my
hopes
are
at
an
end
in
that
boy
and
all
your
kind
endeavours
thrown
away
he
has
just
behaved
in
such
a
manner
as
shows
him
to
be
radically
corrupted
and
insensible
of
every
principle
but
pride
he
then
related
to
mr
barlow
every
incident
of
behaviour
making
the
severest
reflections
upon
his
insolence
and
ingratitude
and
blaming
his
own
supineness
that
had
not
earlier
checked
these
boisterous
passions
that
now
burst
forth
with
such
a
degree
of
fury
that
threatened
ruin
to
his
hopes
indeed
answered
mr
barlow
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
this
account
of
my
little
friend
yet
i
do
not
see
it
in
quite
so
serious
a
light
as
yourself
and
though
i
can
not
deny
the
dangers
that
may
arise
from
a
character
so
susceptible
of
false
impressions
and
so
violent
at
the
same
time
yet
i
do
not
think
the
corruption
either
so
great
or
so
general
as
you
seem
to
suspect
do
we
not
see
even
in
the
most
trifling
habits
of
body
or
speech
that
a
long
and
continual
attention
is
required
if
we
would
wish
to
change
them
and
yet
our
perseverance
is
in
the
end
generally
successful
why
then
should
we
imagine
that
those
of
the
mind
are
less
obstinate
or
subject
to
different
laws
or
why
should
we
rashly
abandon
ourselves
to
despair
from
the
first
experiments
that
do
not
succeed
according
to
our
wishes
indeed
answered
mr
merton
what
you
say
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
general
benevolence
of
your
character
and
most
consolatory
to
the
tenderness
of
a
father
yet
i
know
too
well
the
general
weakness
of
parents
in
respect
to
the
faults
of
their
children
not
to
be
upon
my
guard
against
the
delusions
of
my
own
mind
and
when
i
consider
the
abrupt
transition
of
my
son
into
everything
that
is
most
inconsistent
with
goodness
how
lightly
how
instantaneously
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
everything
he
had
learned
with
you
i
can
not
help
forming
the
most
painful
and
melancholy
presages
of
the
future
alas
sir
answered
mr
barlow
what
is
the
general
malady
of
human
nature
but
this
very
instability
which
now
appears
in
your
son
do
you
imagine
that
half
the
vices
of
men
arise
from
real
depravity
of
heart
on
the
contrary
i
am
convinced
that
human
nature
is
infinitely
more
weak
than
wicked
and
that
the
greater
part
of
all
bad
conduct
springs
rather
from
want
of
firmness
than
from
any
settled
propensity
to
evil
indeed
replied
mr
merton
what
you
say
is
highly
reasonable
nor
did
i
ever
expect
that
a
boy
so
long
indulged
and
spoiled
should
be
exempt
from
failings
but
what
particularly
hurts
me
is
to
see
him
proceed
to
such
disagreeable
extremities
without
any
adequate
temptation
extremities
that
i
fear
imply
a
defect
of
goodness
and
generosity
virtues
which
i
always
thought
he
had
possessed
in
a
very
great
degree
neither
answered
mr
barlow
am
i
at
all
convinced
that
your
son
is
deficient
in
either
but
you
are
to
consider
the
prevalence
of
example
and
the
circle
to
which
you
have
lately
introduced
him
if
it
is
so
difficult
even
for
persons
of
a
more
mature
age
and
experience
to
resist
the
impressions
of
those
with
whom
they
constantly
associate
how
can
you
expect
it
from
your
son
to
be
armed
against
the
prejudices
of
the
world
and
to
distinguish
real
merit
from
the
splendid
vices
which
pass
current
in
what
is
called
society
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
human
sciences
nor
do
i
know
a
single
character
however
excellent
that
would
not
candidly
confess
he
has
often
made
a
wrong
election
and
paid
that
homage
to
a
brilliant
outside
which
is
only
due
to
real
merit
you
comfort
me
very
much
said
mr
merton
but
such
ungovernable
passion
such
violence
and
impetuosity
are
indeed
very
formidable
replied
mr
barlow
yet
when
they
are
properly
directed
frequently
produce
the
noblest
effects
you
have
i
doubt
not
read
the
story
of
polemo
who
from
a
debauched
young
man
became
a
celebrated
philosopher
and
a
model
of
virtue
only
by
attending
a
single
moral
lecture
indeed
said
mr
merton
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
the
various
employments
and
amusements
in
which
i
have
passed
the
greater
part
of
my
life
have
not
afforded
me
as
much
leisure
for
reading
as
i
could
wish
you
will
therefore
oblige
me
very
much
by
repeating
the
story
you
allude
to
the
story
of
polemo
polemo
said
mr
barlow
was
a
young
man
of
athens
and
although
he
was
brought
up
with
the
most
tender
solicitude
and
care
by
his
mother
and
at
one
time
promised
fair
to
be
of
a
studious
and
virtuous
turn
of
mind
as
he
appeared
very
fond
of
reading
and
much
attached
to
literary
pursuits
and
would
frequently
retire
into
the
fields
and
for
hours
sit
upon
the
stump
of
a
tree
with
his
book
before
him
still
after
a
few
years
he
became
so
distinguished
by
his
excesses
that
he
was
the
aversion
of
all
the
discreeter
part
of
the
city
he
led
a
life
of
intemperance
and
dissipation
and
was
constantly
surrounded
by
a
set
of
loose
young
men
who
imitated
and
encouraged
his
vices
and
when
they
had
totally
drowned
the
little
reason
they
possessed
in
copious
draughts
of
wine
they
were
accustomed
to
sally
out
and
practise
every
species
of
absurd
and
licentious
frolic
one
morning
they
were
thus
wandering
about
after
having
spent
the
night
as
usual
when
they
beheld
a
great
concourse
of
people
that
were
listening
to
the
discourse
of
a
celebrated
philosopher
named
xenocrates
the
greater
part
of
the
young
men
who
still
retained
some
sense
of
shame
were
so
struck
with
this
spectacle
that
they
turned
out
of
the
way
but
polemo
who
was
more
daring
and
abandoned
than
the
rest
pressed
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
audience
his
figure
was
too
remarkable
not
to
attract
universal
notice
for
his
head
was
crowned
with
flowers
his
robe
hung
negligently
about
him
and
his
whole
body
was
reeking
with
perfumes
besides
his
look
and
manner
were
such
as
very
little
qualified
him
for
such
a
company
many
of
the
audience
were
so
displeased
at
this
interruption
that
they
were
ready
to
treat
the
young
man
with
great
severity
but
the
venerable
philosopher
prevailed
upon
them
not
to
molest
the
intruder
and
calmly
continued
his
discourse
which
happened
to
be
upon
the
dignity
and
advantages
of
temperance
as
the
sage
proceeded
in
his
oration
he
descanted
upon
this
subject
with
so
much
force
and
eloquence
that
the
young
man
became
more
composed
and
attentive
as
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
presently
the
philosopher
grew
still
more
animated
in
his
representation
of
the
shameful
slavery
which
attends
the
giving
way
to
our
passions
and
the
sublime
happiness
of
reducing
them
all
to
order
and
then
the
countenance
of
polemo
began
to
change
and
the
expression
of
it
to
be
softened
he
cast
his
eyes
in
mournful
silence
upon
the
ground
as
if
in
deep
repentance
for
his
own
contemptible
conduct
still
the
aged
speaker
increased
in
vehemence
he
seemed
to
be
animated
with
the
sacred
genius
of
the
art
which
he
professed
and
to
exercise
an
irresistible
power
over
the
minds
of
his
hearers
he
drew
the
portrait
of
an
ingenious
and
modest
young
man
who
had
been
bred
up
to
virtuous
toils
and
manly
hardiness
he
painted
him
triumphant
over
all
his
passions
and
trampling
upon
human
fears
and
weakness
his
country
be
invaded
you
see
him
fly
to
its
defence
and
ready
to
pour
forth
all
his
blood
calm
and
composed
he
appears
with
a
terrible
beauty
in
the
front
of
danger
the
ornament
and
bulwark
of
his
country
the
thickest
squadrons
are
penetrated
by
his
resistless
valour
and
he
points
the
path
of
victory
to
his
admiring
followers
should
he
fall
in
battle
how
glorious
is
his
lot
to
be
cut
off
in
the
honourable
discharge
of
his
duty
to
be
wept
by
all
the
brave
and
virtuous
and
to
survive
in
the
eternal
records
of
fame
while
xenocrates
was
thus
discoursing
polemo
seemed
to
be
transported
with
a
sacred
enthusiasm
his
eyes
flashed
fire
his
countenance
glowed
with
martial
indignation
and
the
whole
expression
of
his
person
was
changed
presently
the
philosopher
who
had
remarked
the
effect
of
his
discourse
painted
in
no
less
glowing
colours
the
life
and
manners
of
an
effeminate
young
man
youth
said
he
word
shall
i
find
equal
to
thy
abasement
thou
art
the
reproach
of
thy
parents
the
disgrace
of
thy
country
the
scorn
or
pity
of
every
generous
mind
how
is
nature
dishonoured
in
thy
person
and
all
her
choicest
gifts
abortive
that
strength
which
would
have
rendered
thee
the
glory
of
thy
city
and
the
terror
of
her
foes
is
basely
thrown
away
on
luxury
and
intemperance
thy
youth
and
beauty
are
wasted
in
riot
and
prematurely
blasted
by
disease
instead
of
the
eye
of
fire
the
port
of
intrepidity
the
step
of
modest
firmness
a
squalid
paleness
sits
upon
thy
face
a
bloated
corpulency
enfeebles
thy
limbs
and
presents
a
picture
of
human
nature
in
its
most
abject
state
but
hark
the
trumpet
sounds
a
savage
band
of
unrelenting
enemies
has
surrounded
the
city
and
are
preparing
to
scatter
flames
and
ruin
through
the
whole
the
virtuous
youth
that
have
been
educated
to
nobler
cares
arm
with
generous
emulation
and
fly
to
its
defence
how
lovely
do
they
appear
dressed
in
resplendent
arms
and
moving
slowly
on
in
close
impenetrable
phalanx
they
are
animated
by
every
motive
which
can
give
energy
to
a
human
breast
and
lift
it
up
to
the
sublimest
achievements
their
hoary
sires
their
venerable
magistrates
the
beauteous
forms
of
trembling
virgins
attend
them
to
the
war
with
prayers
and
acclamations
go
forth
ye
generous
bands
secure
to
meet
the
rewards
of
victory
or
the
repose
of
honourable
death
go
forth
ye
generous
bands
but
unaccompanied
by
the
wretch
i
have
described
his
feeble
arm
refuses
to
bear
the
ponderous
shield
the
pointed
spear
sinks
feebly
from
his
grasp
he
trembles
at
the
noise
and
tumult
of
the
war
and
flies
like
the
hunted
hart
to
lurk
in
shades
and
darkness
behold
him
roused
from
his
midnight
orgies
reeking
with
wine
and
odours
and
crowned
with
flowers
the
only
trophies
of
his
warfare
he
hurries
with
trembling
steps
across
the
city
his
voice
his
gait
his
whole
deportment
proclaim
the
abject
slave
of
intemperance
and
stamp
indelible
infamy
upon
his
name
while
xenocrates
was
thus
discoursing
polemo
listened
with
fixed
attention
the
former
animation
of
his
countenance
gave
way
to
a
visible
dejection
presently
his
lips
trembled
and
his
cheeks
grew
pale
he
was
lost
in
melancholy
recollection
and
a
silent
tear
was
observed
to
trickle
down
but
when
the
philosopher
described
a
character
so
like
his
own
shame
seemed
to
take
entire
possession
of
his
soul
and
rousing
as
from
a
long
and
painful
lethargy
he
softly
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
and
tore
away
the
chaplets
of
flowers
the
monuments
of
his
effeminacy
and
disgrace
he
seemed
intent
to
compose
his
dress
into
a
more
decent
form
and
wrapped
his
robe
about
him
which
before
hung
loosely
waving
with
an
air
of
studied
effeminacy
but
when
xenocrates
had
finished
his
discourse
polemo
approached
him
with
all
the
humility
of
conscious
guilt
and
begged
to
become
his
disciple
telling
him
that
he
had
that
day
gained
the
most
glorious
conquest
that
had
ever
been
achieved
by
reason
and
philosophy
by
inspiring
with
the
love
of
virtue
a
mind
that
had
been
hitherto
plunged
in
folly
and
sensuality
xenocrates
embraced
the
young
man
and
admitted
him
among
his
disciples
nor
had
he
ever
reason
to
repent
of
his
facility
for
polemo
from
that
hour
abandoned
all
his
former
companions
and
vices
and
by
his
uncommon
ardour
for
improvement
very
soon
became
celebrated
for
virtue
and
wisdom
as
he
had
before
been
for
every
contrary
quality
thus
added
mr
barlow
you
see
how
little
reason
there
is
to
despair
of
youth
even
in
the
most
disadvantageous
circumstances
it
has
been
justly
observed
that
few
know
all
they
are
capable
of
the
seeds
of
different
qualities
frequently
lie
concealed
in
the
character
and
only
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
exerting
themselves
and
it
is
the
great
business
of
education
to
apply
such
motives
to
the
imagination
as
may
stimulate
it
to
laudable
exertions
for
thus
the
same
activity
of
mind
the
same
impetuosity
of
temper
which
by
being
improperly
applied
would
only
form
a
wild
ungovernable
character
may
produce
the
steadiest
virtues
and
prove
a
blessing
both
to
the
individual
and
his
country
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
this
story
said
mr
merton
and
as
my
son
will
certainly
find
a
in
you
i
wish
that
you
may
have
reason
to
think
him
in
some
degree
a
but
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
present
me
these
agreeable
hopes
do
not
leave
the
work
unfinished
but
tell
me
what
you
think
the
best
method
of
treating
him
in
his
present
critical
situation
that
said
mr
barlow
must
depend
i
think
upon
the
workings
of
his
own
mind
he
has
always
appeared
to
me
generous
and
humane
and
to
have
a
fund
of
natural
goodness
amid
all
the
faults
which
spring
up
too
luxuriantly
in
his
character
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
not
be
at
present
possessed
with
the
keenest
shame
for
his
own
behaviour
it
will
be
your
first
part
to
take
advantage
of
these
sentiments
and
instead
of
a
fleeting
and
transitory
sensation
to
change
them
into
fixed
and
active
principles
do
not
at
present
say
much
to
him
upon
the
subject
let
us
both
be
attentive
to
the
silent
workings
of
his
mind
and
regulate
our
behaviour
accordingly
this
conversation
being
finished
mr
merton
introduced
mr
barlow
to
the
company
in
the
other
room
mrs
merton
who
now
began
to
be
a
little
staggered
in
some
of
the
opinions
she
had
been
most
fond
of
received
him
with
uncommon
civility
and
all
the
rest
of
the
company
treated
him
with
the
greatest
respect
but
tommy
who
had
lately
been
the
oracle
and
admiration
of
all
this
brilliant
circle
appeared
to
have
lost
all
his
vivacity
he
indeed
advanced
to
meet
mr
barlow
with
a
look
of
tenderness
and
gratitude
and
made
the
most
respectful
answers
to
all
his
inquiries
but
his
eyes
were
involuntarily
turned
to
the
ground
and
silent
melancholy
and
dejection
were
visible
in
his
face
mr
barlow
remarked
with
the
greatest
pleasure
these
signs
of
humility
and
contrition
and
pointed
them
out
to
mr
merton
the
first
time
he
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
without
being
overheard
adding
that
unless
he
was
much
deceived
tommy
would
soon
give
ample
proofs
of
the
natural
goodness
of
his
character
and
reconcile
himself
to
all
his
friends
mr
merton
heard
this
observation
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
now
began
to
entertain
some
hopes
of
seeing
it
accomplished
after
the
dinner
was
over
most
of
the
young
gentlemen
went
away
to
their
respective
homes
tommy
seemed
to
have
lost
much
of
the
enthusiasm
which
he
had
lately
felt
for
his
polite
and
accomplished
friends
he
even
appeared
to
feel
a
secret
joy
at
their
departure
and
answered
with
a
visible
coldness
at
professions
of
regard
and
repeated
invitations
even
mrs
compton
herself
and
miss
matilda
who
were
also
departing
found
him
as
insensible
as
the
rest
though
they
did
not
spare
the
most
extravagant
praises
and
the
warmest
professions
of
regard
and
now
the
ceremonies
of
taking
leave
being
over
and
most
of
the
visitors
departed
a
sudden
solitude
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
house
which
was
lately
the
seat
of
noise
and
bustle
and
festivity
mr
and
mrs
merton
and
mr
barlow
were
left
alone
with
miss
simmons
and
tommy
and
one
or
two
others
of
the
smaller
gentry
who
had
not
yet
returned
to
their
friends
as
mr
barlow
was
not
fond
of
cards
mr
merton
proposed
after
the
was
removed
that
miss
simmons
who
was
famous
for
reading
well
should
entertain
the
company
with
some
little
tale
or
history
adapted
to
the
comprehension
even
of
the
youngest
miss
simmons
excused
herself
with
the
greatest
modesty
but
on
mrs
merton
joining
in
the
request
she
instantly
complied
and
fetching
down
a
book
read
the
following
story
of
sophron
and
tigranes
sophron
and
tigranes
were
the
children
of
two
neighbouring
shepherds
that
fed
their
flocks
in
that
part
of
asia
which
borders
upon
mount
lebanon
they
were
accustomed
to
each
other
from
earliest
infancy
and
the
continual
habit
of
conversing
at
length
produced
a
tender
and
intimate
friendship
sophron
was
larger
and
more
robust
of
the
two
his
look
was
firm
but
modest
his
countenance
placid
and
his
eyes
were
such
as
inspired
confidence
and
attachment
he
excelled
most
of
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
in
every
species
of
violent
exercise
such
as
wrestling
boxing
and
whirling
heavyweights
but
his
triumphs
were
constantly
mixed
with
so
much
humanity
and
courtesy
that
even
those
who
found
themselves
vanquished
could
feel
no
envy
towards
their
conqueror
on
the
contrary
tigranes
was
of
a
character
totally
different
his
body
was
less
strong
than
that
of
sophron
but
excellently
proportioned
and
adapted
to
every
species
of
fatigue
his
countenance
was
full
of
fire
but
displeased
by
an
excess
of
confidence
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
sense
and
meaning
but
bore
too
great
an
expression
of
uncontrolled
fierceness
nor
were
these
two
youths
less
different
in
the
application
of
their
faculties
than
in
the
nature
of
them
for
tigranes
seemed
to
be
possessed
by
a
restless
spirit
of
commanding
all
his
equals
while
sophron
contented
with
the
enjoyment
of
tranquillity
desired
nothing
more
than
to
avoid
oppression
still
as
they
assisted
their
parents
in
leading
every
morning
their
flocks
to
pasture
they
entertained
each
other
with
rural
sports
or
while
reposing
under
the
shade
of
arching
rocks
during
the
heat
of
the
day
conversed
with
all
the
ease
of
childish
friendship
their
observations
were
not
many
they
were
chiefly
drawn
from
the
objects
of
nature
which
surrounded
them
or
from
the
simple
mode
of
life
to
which
they
had
been
witness
but
even
here
the
diversity
of
their
characters
was
sufficiently
expressed
said
tigranes
one
day
as
he
cast
his
eyes
upwards
to
the
cliffs
of
a
neighbouring
rock
eagle
which
riseth
into
the
immense
regions
of
air
till
he
absolutely
soars
beyond
the
reach
of
sight
were
i
a
bird
i
should
choose
to
resemble
him
that
i
might
traverse
the
clouds
with
a
rapidity
of
a
whirlwind
and
dart
like
lightning
upon
my
prey
eagle
answered
sophron
the
emblem
of
violence
and
injustice
he
is
the
enemy
of
every
bird
and
even
of
every
beast
that
is
weaker
than
himself
were
i
to
choose
i
should
prefer
the
life
of
yonder
swan
that
moves
so
smoothly
and
inoffensively
along
the
river
he
is
strong
enough
to
defend
himself
from
injury
without
opposing
others
and
therefore
he
is
neither
feared
nor
insulted
by
other
animals
while
sophron
was
yet
speaking
the
eagle
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
air
darted
suddenly
down
at
some
distance
and
seizing
a
lamb
was
bearing
it
away
in
his
cruel
talons
when
almost
in
the
same
instant
a
shepherd
who
had
been
watching
all
his
motions
from
a
neighbouring
hill
let
fly
an
arrow
with
so
unerring
an
aim
that
it
pierced
the
body
of
the
bird
and
brought
him
headlong
to
the
ground
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
death
said
sophron
have
often
heard
is
the
fate
of
ambitious
people
while
they
are
endeavouring
to
mount
beyond
their
fellows
they
are
stopped
by
some
unforeseen
misfortune
my
part
said
tigranes
had
rather
perish
in
the
sky
than
enjoy
an
age
of
life
basely
chained
down
and
grovelling
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
we
either
may
enjoy
answered
sophron
in
the
hand
of
heaven
but
may
i
rather
creep
during
life
than
mount
to
commit
injustice
and
oppress
the
innocent
in
this
manner
passed
the
early
years
of
the
two
friends
as
they
grew
up
to
manhood
the
difference
of
their
tempers
became
more
visible
and
gradually
alienated
them
from
each
other
tigranes
began
to
despise
the
uniform
labours
of
the
shepherd
and
the
humble
occupations
of
the
country
his
sheep
were
neglected
and
frequently
wandered
over
the
plains
without
a
leader
to
guard
them
in
the
day
or
bring
them
back
at
night
and
the
greater
part
of
his
time
was
employed
in
climbing
rocks
or
in
traversing
the
forest
to
seek
for
eagles
nests
or
in
piercing
with
his
arrows
the
different
wild
animals
which
inhabit
the
woods
if
he
heard
the
horn
of
the
hunter
or
the
cry
of
the
hound
it
was
impossible
to
restrain
his
eagerness
he
regarded
neither
the
sun
nor
the
winter
frost
while
he
was
pursuing
his
game
the
thickest
woods
the
steepest
mountains
the
deepest
rivers
were
unable
to
stop
him
in
his
career
and
he
triumphed
over
every
danger
and
difficulty
with
such
invincible
courage
as
made
him
at
once
an
object
of
terror
and
admiration
to
all
the
youth
in
the
neighbourhood
his
friend
sophron
alone
beheld
his
exploits
neither
with
terror
nor
admiration
of
all
his
comrades
sophron
was
the
only
one
whom
tigranes
still
continued
to
respect
for
he
knew
that
with
a
gentleness
of
temper
which
scarcely
anything
could
exasperate
he
possessed
the
firmest
courage
and
a
degree
of
bodily
strength
which
rendered
that
courage
invincible
he
affected
indeed
to
despise
the
virtuous
moderation
of
his
friend
and
ridiculed
it
with
some
of
his
looser
comrades
as
an
abject
pusillanimity
but
he
felt
himself
humbled
whenever
he
was
in
his
company
as
before
a
superior
being
and
therefore
gradually
estranged
himself
from
his
society
sophron
on
the
contrary
entertained
the
sincerest
regard
for
his
friend
but
he
knew
his
defects
and
trembled
for
the
consequences
which
the
violence
and
ambition
of
his
character
might
one
day
produce
whenever
tigranes
abandoned
his
flocks
or
left
his
rustic
tasks
undone
sophron
had
the
goodness
to
supply
whatever
he
had
omitted
such
was
the
vigour
of
his
constitution
that
he
was
indefatigable
in
every
labour
nor
did
he
ever
exert
his
force
more
willingly
than
in
performing
these
voluntary
duties
to
his
absent
friend
whenever
he
met
with
tigranes
he
accosted
him
in
the
gentlest
manner
and
endeavoured
to
win
him
back
to
his
former
habits
and
manners
he
represented
to
him
the
injury
he
did
his
parents
and
the
disquietude
he
occasioned
in
their
minds
by
thus
abandoning
the
duties
of
his
profession
he
sometimes
but
with
the
greatest
mildness
hinted
at
the
coldness
with
which
tigranes
treated
him
and
reminded
his
friend
of
the
pleasing
intercourse
of
their
childhood
but
all
his
remonstrances
were
vain
tigranes
heard
him
at
first
with
coolness
then
with
impatience
or
contempt
and
at
last
avoided
him
altogether
sophron
had
a
lamb
which
he
had
formerly
saved
from
the
devouring
jaws
of
a
wolf
who
had
already
bitten
him
in
several
places
and
destroyed
his
dam
the
tenderness
with
which
this
benevolent
young
man
had
nursed
and
fed
him
during
his
infancy
had
so
attached
him
to
his
master
that
he
seemed
to
prefer
his
society
to
that
of
his
own
species
wherever
sophron
went
the
faithful
lamb
accompanied
him
like
his
dogs
lay
down
beside
him
when
he
reposed
and
followed
close
behind
when
he
drove
the
rest
of
the
flock
to
pasture
sophron
was
equally
attached
to
his
dumb
companion
he
often
diverted
himself
with
his
innocent
gambols
fed
him
with
the
choicest
herbs
out
of
his
hands
and
when
he
slept
at
nights
the
lamb
was
sure
to
repose
beside
him
it
happened
about
this
time
that
tigranes
as
he
was
one
day
exploring
the
woods
discovered
the
den
of
a
in
which
she
had
left
her
young
ones
while
she
went
out
to
search
for
prey
by
a
caprice
that
was
natural
to
his
temper
he
chose
out
the
largest
of
the
whelps
carried
it
home
to
his
house
and
brought
it
up
as
if
it
had
been
a
useful
and
harmless
animal
while
it
was
yet
but
young
it
was
incapable
of
doing
mischief
but
as
it
increased
in
age
and
strength
it
began
to
show
signs
of
a
bloody
and
untameable
disposition
and
made
all
the
neighbouring
shepherds
tremble
for
the
safety
of
their
flocks
but
as
the
courage
and
fierceness
of
tigranes
had
now
rendered
him
formidable
to
all
his
associates
and
the
violence
of
his
temper
made
him
impatient
of
all
opposition
they
did
not
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
and
as
to
his
own
parents
he
had
long
learned
to
treat
them
with
indifference
and
contempt
sophron
alone
who
was
not
to
be
awed
by
fear
observing
the
just
apprehensions
of
the
neighbourhood
undertook
the
task
of
expostulating
with
his
friend
and
endeavoured
to
prevail
upon
him
to
part
with
a
beast
so
justly
odious
and
which
might
in
the
end
prove
fatal
whenever
his
natural
rage
should
break
out
into
open
acts
of
slaughter
tigranes
heard
him
with
a
sneer
of
derision
and
only
answered
that
a
parcel
of
miserable
rustics
diverted
themselves
with
keeping
sheep
he
who
had
a
more
elevated
soul
might
surely
entertain
a
nobler
animal
for
his
diversion
should
that
nobler
animal
prove
a
public
mischief
coolly
replied
sophron
must
expect
that
he
will
be
treated
as
a
public
enemy
be
to
the
man
answered
tigranes
brandishing
his
javelin
and
sternly
frowning
shall
dare
to
meddle
with
anything
that
belongs
to
me
saying
this
he
turned
his
back
upon
sophron
and
left
him
with
disdain
it
was
not
long
before
the
very
event
took
place
which
had
been
so
long
foreseen
the
wolf
of
tigranes
either
impelled
by
the
accidental
taste
of
blood
or
by
the
natural
fierceness
of
his
own
temper
fell
one
day
upon
the
sheep
with
such
an
unexpected
degree
of
fury
that
he
slaughtered
thirty
of
them
before
it
was
possible
to
prevent
him
sophron
happened
at
that
time
to
be
within
view
he
ran
with
amazing
swiftness
to
the
place
and
found
the
savage
bathed
in
blood
tearing
the
carcass
of
a
lamb
he
had
just
slain
at
the
approach
of
the
daring
youth
the
wolf
began
to
utter
a
dismal
cry
and
quitting
his
prey
seemed
to
prepare
himself
for
slaughter
of
another
kind
sophron
was
entirely
unarmed
and
the
size
and
fury
of
the
beast
which
rushed
forward
to
attack
him
might
well
have
excused
him
had
he
declined
the
combat
but
he
consulting
only
his
native
courage
wrapped
his
shepherd
cloak
around
his
left
arm
to
resist
the
first
onset
of
his
enemy
and
with
a
determined
look
and
nimble
pace
advanced
towards
his
threatening
adversary
in
an
instant
the
wolf
sprang
upon
him
with
a
horrid
yell
but
sophron
nimbly
eluded
his
attack
and
suddenly
throwing
his
vigorous
arms
about
the
body
of
his
adversary
compelled
him
to
struggle
for
his
own
safety
it
was
then
that
he
uttered
cries
more
dreadful
than
before
and
as
he
writhed
about
in
all
the
agitations
of
pain
and
madness
he
gnashed
his
terrible
teeth
with
impotent
attempts
to
bite
while
the
blood
and
foam
which
issued
from
his
jaws
rendered
his
figure
still
more
horrible
than
before
but
sophron
with
undaunted
courage
still
maintained
his
hold
and
grasping
him
with
irresistible
strength
prevented
him
from
using
either
his
teeth
or
claws
in
his
own
defence
it
was
not
long
before
the
struggles
and
violence
of
the
wolf
grew
perceptibly
weaker
from
fatigue
and
he
seemed
to
wish
to
decline
a
further
combat
with
so
formidable
a
foe
could
he
have
found
means
to
escape
sophron
then
collected
all
his
strength
and
seizing
his
fainting
adversary
by
the
neck
and
throat
grasped
him
still
tighter
in
his
terrible
hands
till
the
beast
incapable
either
of
disengaging
himself
or
breathing
yielded
up
the
contest
and
his
life
together
it
was
almost
in
this
moment
that
tigranes
passed
that
way
and
unexpectedly
was
witness
to
the
triumphs
of
sophron
and
the
miserable
end
of
his
favourite
inflamed
with
pride
and
indignation
tigranes
uttered
dreadful
imprecations
against
his
friend
who
in
vain
attempted
to
explain
the
transaction
and
rushing
upon
him
with
all
the
madness
of
inveterate
hate
aimed
a
javelin
at
his
bosom
sophron
was
calm
as
he
was
brave
he
saw
the
necessity
of
defending
his
own
life
against
the
attacks
of
a
perfidious
friend
and
with
a
nimble
spring
at
once
eluded
the
weapon
and
closed
with
his
antagonist
the
combat
was
then
more
equal
for
each
was
reduced
to
depend
upon
his
own
strength
and
activity
they
struggled
for
some
time
with
all
the
efforts
which
disappointed
rage
could
inspire
on
the
one
side
and
a
virtuous
indignation
on
the
other
at
length
the
fortune
or
rather
the
force
and
coolness
of
sophron
prevailed
over
the
blind
impetuous
fury
of
tigranes
he
at
once
exerted
his
whole
remaining
strength
with
such
success
that
he
hurled
his
adversary
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
bleeding
vanquished
and
unable
to
rise
scarcely
said
sophron
thy
life
from
my
hands
who
couldst
so
wantonly
and
unjustly
attempt
to
deprive
me
of
mine
however
i
will
rather
remember
thy
early
merits
than
my
recent
injuries
replied
the
raging
tigranes
me
not
with
thy
odious
benefits
but
rather
rid
me
of
a
life
which
i
abhor
since
thou
hast
robbed
me
of
my
honour
will
never
hurt
thee
replied
sophron
in
my
own
just
defence
live
to
make
a
better
use
of
life
and
to
have
juster
ideas
of
honour
saying
this
he
assisted
tigranes
to
rise
but
finding
his
temper
full
of
implacable
resentment
he
turned
another
way
and
left
him
to
go
home
alone
it
was
not
long
after
this
event
that
a
company
of
soldiers
marched
across
the
plains
where
sophron
was
feeding
his
flocks
and
halted
to
refresh
themselves
under
the
shade
of
some
spreading
trees
the
officer
who
commanded
them
was
struck
with
the
comely
figure
and
expressive
countenance
of
sophron
he
called
the
young
man
to
him
and
endeavoured
to
inflame
him
with
a
military
ardour
by
setting
before
him
the
glory
which
might
be
acquired
by
arms
and
ridiculing
the
obscurity
of
a
country
life
when
he
thought
he
had
sufficiently
excited
his
admiration
he
proposed
to
him
that
he
should
enrol
himself
in
his
company
and
promised
him
every
encouragement
which
he
thought
most
likely
to
engage
the
passions
of
a
young
man
sophron
thanked
him
with
humility
for
his
offers
but
told
him
he
had
an
aged
father
who
was
now
become
incapable
of
maintaining
himself
and
therefore
that
he
could
accept
of
no
offers
however
advantageous
they
might
appear
which
would
interfere
with
the
discharge
of
this
duty
the
officer
replied
and
ridiculed
the
scruples
of
the
young
man
but
finding
him
inflexible
in
his
resolution
he
at
last
turned
from
him
with
an
air
of
contempt
and
called
his
men
to
follow
him
muttering
as
he
went
reflections
on
the
stupidity
and
cowardice
of
sophron
the
party
had
not
proceeded
far
before
by
ill
fortune
they
came
to
the
place
where
sophron
favourite
lamb
was
feeding
and
as
the
animal
had
not
yet
learned
to
dread
the
cruelty
of
the
human
species
it
advanced
towards
them
with
all
the
confidence
of
unsuspicious
innocence
is
a
lucky
accident
cried
one
of
the
soldiers
with
a
brutal
satisfaction
was
not
willing
we
should
go
without
a
supper
and
has
therefore
sent
us
a
present
happy
exchange
answered
a
second
fat
sheep
for
a
lubberly
shepherd
and
the
coward
will
no
doubt
think
himself
happy
to
sleep
in
a
whole
skin
at
so
small
an
expense
saying
this
he
took
the
lamb
and
bore
it
away
in
triumph
uttering
a
thousand
threats
and
execrations
against
the
master
if
he
should
dare
to
reclaim
it
sophron
was
not
so
far
removed
to
escape
the
sight
of
the
indignity
that
was
offered
him
he
followed
the
troop
with
so
much
swiftness
that
it
was
not
long
before
he
overtook
the
soldier
who
was
bearing
away
his
friend
and
from
his
load
marched
rather
behind
the
rest
when
sophron
approached
him
he
accosted
him
in
the
gentlest
manner
and
besought
him
in
words
that
might
have
touched
any
one
but
a
savage
to
restore
his
favourite
he
even
offered
when
he
found
that
nothing
else
would
avail
to
purchase
back
his
own
property
with
something
of
greater
value
but
the
barbarous
soldier
inured
to
scenes
of
misery
and
little
accustomed
to
yield
to
human
entreaties
only
laughed
at
his
complaints
and
loaded
him
with
additional
insults
at
length
he
began
to
be
tired
with
his
importunities
and
drawing
his
sword
and
waving
it
before
the
eyes
of
sophron
threatened
that
if
he
did
not
depart
immediately
he
would
use
him
as
he
intended
to
do
the
lamb
do
you
think
answered
sophron
while
i
have
an
arm
to
lift
or
a
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
i
will
suffer
you
or
any
man
to
rob
me
of
what
i
value
more
than
life
the
soldier
exasperated
at
such
an
insolent
reply
as
he
termed
it
aimed
a
blow
at
sophron
with
his
sword
which
he
turned
aside
with
a
stick
he
held
in
his
hand
so
that
it
glanced
inoffensively
down
and
before
he
could
recover
the
use
of
his
weapon
sophron
who
was
infinitely
stronger
closed
in
with
him
wrested
it
out
of
his
hands
and
hurled
him
roughly
to
the
ground
some
of
the
comrades
of
the
vanquished
soldier
came
in
an
instant
to
his
assistance
and
without
inquiring
into
the
merits
of
the
cause
drew
their
swords
and
began
to
assail
the
undaunted
young
man
but
he
brandishing
the
weapon
which
he
had
just
seized
appeared
ready
to
defend
himself
with
so
much
strength
and
courage
that
they
did
not
choose
to
come
too
near
while
they
were
thus
engaged
the
officer
who
had
turned
back
at
the
first
noise
of
the
fray
approached
and
ordering
his
men
to
desist
inquired
into
the
occasion
of
the
contest
sophron
then
recounted
with
so
much
modesty
and
respect
the
indignities
and
insults
he
had
received
and
the
unprovoked
attack
of
the
soldier
which
had
obliged
him
to
defend
his
own
life
that
the
officer
who
had
a
real
respect
for
courage
was
charmed
with
the
behaviour
of
the
young
man
he
therefore
reproved
his
men
for
their
disorderly
manners
praised
the
intrepidity
of
sophron
and
ordered
his
lamb
to
be
restored
to
him
with
which
he
joyfully
departed
sophron
was
scarcely
out
of
sight
when
tigranes
who
was
then
by
accident
returning
from
the
chase
met
the
same
party
upon
their
march
their
military
attire
and
glittering
arms
instantly
struck
his
mind
with
admiration
he
stopped
to
gaze
upon
them
as
they
passed
and
the
officer
who
remarked
the
martial
air
and
limbs
of
tigranes
entered
into
conversation
with
him
and
made
him
the
same
proposals
which
he
had
before
done
to
sophron
such
incentives
were
irresistible
to
a
vain
and
ambitious
mind
the
young
man
in
an
instant
forgot
his
friends
his
country
and
his
parents
and
marched
away
with
all
the
pleasure
that
strong
presumption
and
aspiring
hopes
could
raise
nor
was
it
long
before
he
had
an
opportunity
of
signalizing
his
intrepidity
asia
was
at
that
time
overrun
by
numerous
bands
of
savage
warriors
under
different
and
independent
chiefs
that
country
which
has
in
every
age
been
celebrated
for
the
mildness
of
the
climate
and
the
fertility
of
the
soil
seems
to
be
destined
to
groan
under
all
the
horrors
of
eternal
servitude
whether
these
effects
are
merely
produced
by
fortune
or
whether
the
natural
advantages
it
enjoys
have
a
necessary
tendency
to
soften
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
to
sloth
and
effeminacy
it
is
certain
that
the
people
of
asia
have
in
general
been
the
unresisting
prey
of
every
invader
at
this
time
several
fierce
and
barbarous
nations
had
broken
in
upon
its
territory
and
after
covering
its
fertile
plains
with
carnage
and
desolation
were
contending
with
each
other
for
the
superiority
under
the
most
enterprising
of
these
rival
chiefs
was
tigranes
now
enrolled
and
in
the
very
first
engagement
at
which
he
was
present
he
gave
such
uncommon
proofs
of
valour
that
he
was
distinguished
by
the
general
with
marks
of
particular
regard
and
became
the
admiration
of
all
his
comrades
under
the
banners
of
this
adventurous
warrior
did
tigranes
toil
with
various
fortunes
during
the
space
of
many
years
sometimes
victorious
in
the
fight
sometimes
baffled
at
one
time
crowned
with
conquest
and
glory
at
another
beset
with
dangers
covered
with
wounds
and
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
through
rocks
and
forests
yet
still
the
native
courage
of
his
temper
sustained
his
spirits
and
kept
him
firm
in
the
profession
which
he
had
chosen
at
length
in
a
decisive
battle
in
which
the
chieftain
under
whom
tigranes
had
enlisted
contended
with
the
most
powerful
of
his
rivals
he
had
the
honour
of
retrieving
the
victory
when
his
own
party
seemed
totally
routed
and
after
having
penetrated
the
thickest
squadrons
of
the
enemy
to
kill
their
general
with
his
own
hand
from
this
moment
he
seemed
to
be
in
possession
of
all
that
his
ambition
could
desire
he
was
appointed
general
of
all
the
troops
under
the
chief
himself
whose
repeated
victories
had
rendered
him
equal
in
power
to
the
most
celebrated
monarchs
nor
did
his
fortune
stop
even
here
for
after
a
number
of
successive
battles
in
which
his
party
were
generally
victorious
by
his
experience
and
intrepidity
he
was
on
the
unexpected
death
of
the
chief
unanimously
chosen
by
the
whole
nation
to
succeed
him
in
the
mean
time
sophron
free
from
envy
avarice
or
ambition
pursued
the
natural
impulse
of
his
character
and
contented
himself
with
a
life
of
virtuous
obscurity
he
passed
his
time
in
rural
labours
in
watching
his
flocks
and
in
attending
with
all
the
duty
of
an
affectionate
child
upon
his
aged
parents
every
morning
he
rose
with
the
sun
and
spreading
his
innocent
arms
to
heaven
thanked
that
being
who
created
all
nature
for
the
continuance
of
life
and
health
and
all
the
blessings
he
enjoyed
his
piety
and
virtue
were
rewarded
with
everything
which
a
temperate
and
rational
mind
can
ask
all
his
rural
labours
succeeded
in
the
most
ample
manner
his
flock
was
the
fairest
the
most
healthy
and
numerous
of
the
district
he
was
loved
and
esteemed
by
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
and
equally
respected
by
the
aged
who
pointed
him
out
as
the
example
of
every
virtue
to
their
families
but
what
was
more
dear
than
all
the
rest
to
such
a
mind
as
sophron
was
to
see
himself
the
joy
the
comfort
and
support
of
his
parents
who
frequently
embraced
him
with
tears
and
supplicated
the
deity
to
reward
such
duty
and
affection
with
all
his
choicest
blessings
nor
was
his
humanity
confined
to
his
own
species
the
innocent
inhabitants
of
the
forest
were
safe
from
the
pursuit
of
sophron
and
all
that
lived
under
his
protection
were
sure
to
meet
with
distinguished
tenderness
is
enough
said
sophron
the
innocent
sheep
supplies
me
with
his
fleece
to
form
my
winter
garments
and
defend
me
from
the
cold
i
will
not
bereave
him
of
his
little
life
nor
stop
his
harmless
gambols
on
the
green
to
gratify
a
guilty
sensuality
it
is
surely
enough
that
the
stately
heifer
affords
me
copious
streams
of
pure
and
wholesome
food
i
will
not
arm
my
hand
against
her
innocent
existence
i
will
not
pollute
myself
with
her
blood
nor
tear
her
warm
and
panting
flesh
with
a
cruelty
that
we
abhor
even
in
savage
beasts
more
wholesome
more
adapted
to
human
life
are
the
spontaneous
fruits
which
liberal
nature
produces
for
the
sustenance
of
man
or
which
the
earth
affords
to
recompense
his
labours
here
the
interest
and
concern
which
had
been
long
visible
in
face
could
no
longer
be
repressed
and
tears
began
to
trickle
down
his
cheeks
what
is
the
matter
my
darling
said
his
mother
what
is
there
in
the
account
of
this
young
man
so
deeply
interests
and
affects
you
alas
mamma
said
tommy
it
reminds
of
poor
harry
sandford
just
such
another
good
young
man
will
he
be
when
he
is
as
old
as
sophron
and
i
and
i
added
he
sobbing
am
just
such
another
worthless
ungrateful
wretch
as
tigranes
but
tigranes
said
mrs
merton
you
see
became
a
great
and
powerful
man
while
sophron
remained
only
a
poor
and
ignorant
shepherd
what
does
that
signify
mamma
said
tommy
for
my
part
i
begin
to
find
that
it
is
not
always
the
greatest
people
that
are
the
best
or
happiest
and
as
to
ignorance
i
can
not
think
that
sophron
who
understood
his
duty
so
well
to
his
parents
and
to
god
and
to
all
the
world
could
be
called
ignorant
and
very
likely
he
could
read
and
write
better
than
tigranes
in
spite
of
all
his
pomp
and
grandeur
for
i
am
sure
there
is
not
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
that
went
home
can
read
as
well
as
harry
sandford
or
has
half
his
understanding
mr
merton
could
hardly
help
smiling
at
tommy
conjecture
about
sophron
reading
but
he
felt
the
greatest
pleasure
at
seeing
such
a
change
in
his
sentiments
and
looking
at
him
with
more
cordiality
than
he
had
done
before
he
told
him
that
he
was
very
happy
to
find
him
so
sensible
of
his
faults
and
hoped
he
would
be
equally
ready
to
amend
them
miss
simmons
then
continued
her
narrative
if
sophron
ever
permitted
himself
to
shed
the
blood
of
living
creatures
it
was
those
ferocious
animals
that
wage
continual
war
with
every
other
species
amid
the
mountains
which
he
inhabited
there
were
rugged
cliffs
and
inaccessible
caverns
which
afforded
retreat
to
wolves
and
bears
and
tigers
sometimes
amid
the
storms
and
snows
of
winter
they
felt
themselves
pinched
by
hunger
and
fell
with
irresistible
fury
upon
the
nearest
flocks
and
herds
not
only
sheep
and
oxen
were
slaughtered
in
these
dreadful
and
unexpected
attacks
but
even
the
shepherds
themselves
were
frequently
the
victims
of
their
rage
if
there
was
time
to
assemble
for
their
defence
the
boldest
of
the
youth
would
frequently
seize
their
arms
and
give
battle
to
the
invaders
in
this
warfare
which
was
equally
just
and
honourable
sophron
was
always
foremost
his
unequalled
strength
and
courage
made
all
the
youth
adopt
him
as
their
leader
and
march
with
confidence
under
his
command
and
so
successful
were
his
expeditions
that
he
always
returned
loaded
with
the
skins
of
vanquished
enemies
and
by
his
vigilance
and
intrepidity
he
at
length
either
killed
or
drove
away
most
of
the
beasts
from
which
any
danger
was
to
be
feared
it
happened
one
day
that
sophron
had
been
chasing
a
wolf
which
had
made
some
depredations
upon
the
flocks
and
in
the
ardour
of
his
pursuits
was
separated
from
all
his
companions
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
roughest
parts
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
and
too
indifferent
to
danger
to
be
disturbed
at
this
circumstance
he
therefore
followed
his
flying
foe
with
so
much
impetuosity
that
he
completely
lost
every
track
and
mark
with
which
he
was
acquainted
as
it
is
difficult
in
a
wild
and
uncultivated
district
to
find
the
path
again
when
once
it
is
lost
sophron
only
wandered
the
farther
from
his
home
the
more
he
endeavoured
to
return
he
found
himself
bewildered
and
entangled
in
a
dreary
wilderness
where
he
was
every
instant
stopped
by
torrents
that
tumbled
from
the
neighbouring
cliffs
or
in
danger
of
slipping
down
the
precipices
of
an
immense
height
he
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
gloomy
forest
where
human
industry
had
never
penetrated
nor
the
woodman
axe
been
heard
since
the
moment
of
its
creation
to
add
to
his
distress
the
setting
sun
disappeared
in
the
west
and
the
shades
of
night
gathered
gradually
round
accompanied
with
the
roar
of
savage
beasts
sophron
found
himself
beset
with
terrors
but
his
soul
was
incapable
of
fear
he
poised
his
javelin
in
his
hand
and
forced
his
way
through
every
opposition
till
at
length
with
infinite
difficulty
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
forest
just
as
the
last
glimmer
of
light
was
yet
visible
in
the
skies
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
had
thus
escaped
he
cast
his
eyes
around
but
could
discern
nothing
but
an
immense
tract
of
country
rough
with
rocks
and
overhung
with
forests
but
destitute
of
every
mark
of
cultivation
or
inhabitants
he
however
pursued
his
way
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
till
he
descended
into
a
pleasant
valley
free
from
trees
and
watered
by
a
winding
stream
here
he
was
going
to
repose
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
under
the
crag
of
an
impending
rock
when
a
rising
gleam
of
light
darted
suddenly
into
the
skies
from
a
considerable
distance
and
attracted
his
curiosity
sophron
looked
towards
the
quarter
whence
it
came
and
plainly
discerned
that
it
was
a
fire
kindled
either
by
some
benighted
traveller
like
himself
or
by
some
less
innocent
wanderers
of
the
dark
he
determined
to
approach
the
light
but
knowing
the
unsettled
state
of
all
the
neighbouring
districts
he
thought
it
prudent
to
advance
with
caution
he
therefore
made
a
considerable
circuit
and
by
clambering
along
the
higher
grounds
discovered
a
hanging
wood
under
whose
thick
covert
he
approached
without
being
discovered
within
a
little
distance
of
the
fire
he
then
perceived
that
a
party
of
soldiers
were
reposing
round
a
flaming
pile
of
wood
and
carousing
at
their
ease
all
about
was
strewn
the
plunder
which
they
had
accumulated
in
their
march
and
in
the
midst
was
seated
a
venerable
old
man
accompanied
by
a
beautiful
young
woman
sophron
easily
comprehended
by
the
dejection
of
their
countenances
and
the
tears
which
trickled
down
the
maiden
cheeks
as
well
as
by
the
insolence
with
which
they
were
treated
that
they
were
prisoners
the
virtuous
indignation
of
his
temper
was
instantly
excited
and
he
determined
to
attempt
their
deliverance
but
this
in
spite
of
all
his
intrepidity
he
perceived
was
no
easy
matter
to
accomplish
he
was
alone
and
weakly
armed
his
enemies
though
not
numerous
too
many
for
him
to
flatter
himself
with
any
rational
hope
of
success
by
open
force
and
should
he
make
a
fruitless
effort
he
might
rashly
throw
his
life
away
and
only
aggravate
the
distresses
he
sought
to
cure
with
this
consideration
he
restrained
his
natural
impetuosity
and
at
length
determined
to
attempt
by
stratagem
what
he
thought
could
scarcely
be
performed
by
force
he
therefore
silently
withdrew
and
skirted
the
side
of
the
wood
which
had
concealed
him
carefully
remarking
every
circumstance
of
the
way
till
he
had
ascended
a
mountain
which
immediately
fronted
the
camp
of
the
soldiers
at
no
considerable
distance
he
happened
to
have
by
his
side
a
kind
of
which
they
use
in
the
chase
of
bears
with
this
he
applied
himself
to
lopping
the
branches
of
trees
collecting
at
the
same
time
all
the
fallen
ones
he
could
find
till
in
a
short
time
he
had
reared
several
piles
of
wood
upon
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
mountain
and
full
in
view
of
the
soldiers
he
then
easily
kindled
a
blaze
by
rubbing
two
decayed
branches
together
and
in
an
instant
all
the
piles
were
blazing
with
so
many
streams
of
light
that
the
neighbouring
hills
and
forests
were
illuminated
with
the
gleam
sophron
knew
the
nature
of
man
always
prone
to
sudden
impressions
of
fear
and
terror
more
particularly
amid
the
obscurity
of
the
night
and
promised
himself
the
amplest
success
from
his
stratagem
in
the
meantime
he
hastened
back
with
all
the
speed
he
could
use
till
he
reached
the
very
wood
where
he
had
lurked
before
he
then
raised
his
voice
which
was
naturally
loud
and
clear
and
shouted
several
times
successively
with
all
his
exertion
a
hundred
echoes
from
the
neighbouring
cliffs
and
caverns
returned
the
sound
with
a
reverberation
that
made
it
appear
like
the
noise
of
a
mighty
squadron
the
soldiers
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
sudden
blaze
of
so
many
fires
which
they
attributed
to
a
numerous
band
of
troops
were
now
impressed
with
such
a
panic
that
they
fled
in
confusion
they
imagined
themselves
surrounded
by
their
enemies
who
were
bursting
in
on
every
side
and
fled
with
so
much
precipitation
that
they
were
dispersed
in
an
instant
and
left
the
prisoners
to
themselves
sophron
who
saw
from
a
little
distance
all
their
motions
did
not
wait
for
them
to
be
undeceived
but
running
to
the
spot
they
had
abandoned
explained
in
a
few
words
to
the
trembling
and
amazed
captives
the
nature
of
his
stratagem
and
exhorted
them
to
fly
with
all
the
swiftness
they
were
able
to
exert
few
entreaties
were
necessary
to
prevail
upon
them
to
comply
they
therefore
arose
and
followed
sophron
who
led
them
a
considerable
way
up
into
the
mountains
and
when
he
thought
them
out
of
the
immediate
danger
of
pursuit
they
sheltered
themselves
in
a
rocky
cavern
and
determined
there
to
wait
for
the
light
of
the
morning
when
they
were
thus
in
a
place
of
safety
the
venerable
old
man
seized
the
hand
of
sophron
and
bedewing
it
with
tears
gave
way
to
the
strong
emotions
of
gratitude
which
overwhelmed
his
mind
youth
said
he
know
not
by
what
extraordinary
fortune
you
have
thus
been
able
to
effect
our
deliverance
when
we
imagined
ourselves
out
of
the
reach
of
human
succour
but
if
the
uniform
gratitude
and
affection
of
two
human
beings
who
perhaps
are
not
entirely
unworthy
your
regard
can
be
any
recompense
for
such
a
distinguished
act
of
virtue
you
may
command
our
lives
and
employ
them
in
your
service
answered
sophron
infinitely
the
merits
of
the
service
which
chance
has
enabled
me
to
perform
i
am
but
little
acquainted
with
my
as
having
always
inhabited
these
mountains
but
i
can
not
conceive
that
any
other
man
who
had
been
witness
to
your
distress
would
have
refused
to
attempt
your
rescue
and
as
to
all
the
rest
the
obscurity
of
the
night
and
peculiarity
of
the
situation
rendered
it
a
work
of
little
difficulty
or
danger
sophron
then
recounted
to
his
new
friends
the
accident
which
had
brought
him
to
that
unfrequented
spot
and
made
him
an
unperceived
witness
of
their
captivity
he
also
explained
the
nature
of
the
stratagem
by
which
alone
and
unsupported
he
had
been
enabled
to
disperse
their
enemies
he
added
that
he
appeared
to
have
any
little
merit
in
their
eyes
he
should
be
amply
recompensed
by
being
admitted
to
their
friendship
and
confidence
with
these
mutual
professions
of
esteem
they
thought
it
prudent
to
terminate
a
conversation
which
however
agreeable
was
not
entirely
free
from
danger
as
some
of
their
late
oppressors
might
happen
to
distinguish
their
voices
and
thus
directed
to
their
lurking
place
exact
a
severe
revenge
for
the
terrors
they
had
undergone
with
the
first
ray
of
morning
the
three
companions
arose
and
sophron
leading
them
along
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
where
bushes
and
brushwood
concealed
them
from
observation
and
still
following
the
windings
of
a
river
as
a
guide
they
at
length
came
to
a
cultivated
spot
though
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
from
the
fear
of
the
party
they
had
lately
escaped
here
they
made
a
slight
and
hasty
repast
upon
some
coarse
provisions
which
they
found
and
instantly
struck
again
into
the
woods
which
they
judged
safer
than
the
plain
but
sophron
fortunately
recollected
that
he
had
formerly
visited
this
village
with
his
father
while
yet
a
child
and
before
the
country
had
suffered
the
rage
of
barbarous
invasions
it
was
a
long
day
march
from
home
but
by
exerting
all
their
strength
they
at
length
arrived
through
rough
and
secret
paths
at
the
hospitable
cottage
where
sophron
and
his
parents
dwelt
here
they
were
joyfully
received
as
the
long
absence
of
the
young
man
had
much
alarmed
his
parents
and
made
all
the
hamlet
anxious
concerning
his
safety
that
night
they
comfortably
reposed
in
a
place
of
safety
and
the
next
morning
after
a
plentiful
but
coarse
repast
the
father
of
sophron
again
congratulated
his
guests
upon
their
fortunate
escape
and
entreated
them
to
let
him
hear
the
history
of
their
misfortunes
can
refuse
nothing
said
the
venerable
stranger
persons
to
whom
i
am
under
such
extraordinary
obligations
although
the
history
of
my
life
is
short
and
simple
and
contains
little
worthy
to
be
recited
my
name
is
and
i
was
born
in
one
of
the
maritime
cities
of
asia
of
opulent
parents
who
died
while
i
was
yet
a
youth
the
loss
of
my
parents
to
whom
i
was
most
affectionately
attached
made
so
strong
an
impression
upon
my
mind
that
i
determined
to
seek
relief
in
travel
and
for
that
purpose
sold
my
paternal
estate
the
price
of
which
i
converted
into
money
and
jewels
as
being
most
portable
my
father
had
been
a
man
distinguished
for
his
knowledge
and
abilities
and
from
him
i
imbibed
an
early
desire
of
improvement
which
has
always
been
my
greatest
comfort
and
support
first
place
therefore
which
i
visited
was
egypt
a
country
renowned
in
every
age
for
its
invention
of
all
the
arts
which
contribute
to
support
or
adorn
human
life
there
i
resided
several
years
giving
up
my
time
to
the
study
of
philosophy
and
to
the
conversation
of
the
many
eminent
men
who
resorted
thither
from
all
the
regions
of
the
world
this
country
is
one
immense
plain
divided
by
the
nile
which
is
one
of
the
noblest
rivers
in
the
world
and
pours
its
tide
along
the
middle
of
its
territory
every
year
at
a
particular
season
the
stream
begins
gradually
to
swell
with
such
an
increase
of
waters
that
at
length
it
rises
over
its
banks
and
the
whole
extent
of
egypt
becomes
an
immense
lake
where
buildings
temples
and
cities
appear
as
floating
upon
the
inundation
nor
is
this
event
a
subject
of
dread
to
the
inhabitants
on
the
contrary
the
overflowing
of
their
river
is
a
day
of
public
rejoicing
to
all
the
natives
which
they
celebrate
with
songs
and
dances
and
every
symptom
of
extravagant
joy
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
when
you
are
informed
that
this
inundation
renders
the
soil
which
it
covers
the
most
abundant
in
the
world
whatever
land
is
covered
by
the
waters
receives
such
an
increase
of
fertility
as
never
to
disappoint
the
hopes
of
the
industrious
husbandman
the
instant
the
waters
have
retired
the
farmer
returns
to
his
fields
and
begins
the
operation
of
agriculture
these
labours
are
not
very
difficult
in
a
soft
and
yielding
slime
such
as
the
river
leaves
behind
it
the
seeds
are
sown
and
vegetate
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
in
a
few
weeks
an
abundant
harvest
of
every
kind
of
grain
covers
the
land
for
this
reason
all
the
necessaries
of
life
are
easily
procured
by
the
innumerable
multitudes
which
inhabit
the
country
nor
is
the
climate
less
favourable
than
the
soil
for
here
an
eternal
spring
and
summer
seem
to
have
fixed
their
abode
no
frost
nor
snow
is
ever
known
to
chill
the
atmosphere
which
is
always
perfumed
with
the
smell
of
aromatic
plants
that
grow
on
every
side
and
bring
on
a
pleasing
forgetfulness
of
human
care
but
alas
these
blessings
great
as
they
may
appear
produce
the
effect
of
curses
upon
the
inhabitants
the
ease
and
plenty
which
they
enjoy
enervate
their
manners
and
destroy
all
vigour
both
of
body
and
mind
no
one
here
is
inflamed
with
the
sacred
love
of
his
country
or
of
public
liberty
no
one
is
inured
to
arms
or
taught
to
prefer
his
honour
to
his
life
the
great
business
of
existence
is
an
inglorious
indolence
a
lethargy
of
mind
and
a
continual
suspense
from
all
exertion
the
very
children
catch
the
contagion
from
their
parents
they
are
instructed
in
every
effeminate
art
to
dance
in
soft
unmanly
attitudes
to
modulate
their
voices
by
musical
instruments
and
to
adjust
the
floating
drapery
of
their
dress
these
are
the
arts
in
which
both
sexes
are
instructed
from
their
infancy
but
no
one
is
taught
to
wield
the
arms
of
men
to
tame
the
noble
steeds
in
which
the
country
abounds
to
observe
his
rank
in
war
or
to
bear
the
indispensable
hardships
of
a
military
life
hence
this
celebrated
country
which
has
been
in
every
age
the
admiration
of
mankind
is
destined
to
the
most
degrading
servitude
a
few
thousand
disciplined
troops
are
sufficient
to
hold
the
many
millions
it
contains
in
bondage
under
which
they
groan
without
ever
conceiving
the
design
of
vindicating
their
natural
rights
by
arms
people
exclaimed
sophron
useless
to
them
are
all
the
blessings
of
their
climate
how
much
rather
would
i
inhabit
the
stormy
top
of
lebanon
amid
eternal
snows
and
barrenness
than
wallow
in
the
vile
sensuality
of
such
a
country
or
breathe
an
air
infected
by
its
vices
chares
was
charmed
with
the
generous
indignation
of
sophron
and
thus
continued
was
of
the
same
opinion
with
yourself
and
therefore
determined
to
leave
a
country
which
all
its
natural
advantages
could
not
render
agreeable
when
i
became
acquainted
with
the
manners
of
its
inhabitants
but
before
i
quitted
that
part
of
the
globe
my
curiosity
led
me
to
visit
the
neighbouring
tribes
of
arabia
a
nation
bordering
upon
the
egyptians
but
as
different
in
spirits
and
manners
as
the
hardy
shepherds
of
these
mountains
from
the
effeminate
natives
of
the
plains
egypt
is
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
sea
on
every
other
it
is
surrounded
by
immense
plains
or
gentle
eminences
which
being
beyond
the
fertilizing
inundations
of
the
nile
have
been
beyond
all
memory
converted
into
waste
and
barren
sands
by
the
excessive
heat
of
the
sun
i
therefore
made
preparations
for
my
journey
and
hired
a
guide
who
was
to
furnish
me
with
beasts
of
burden
and
accompany
me
across
those
dreary
deserts
we
accordingly
began
our
march
mounted
upon
camels
which
are
found
much
more
useful
than
horses
in
such
a
burning
climate
indeed
said
tommy
here
to
mr
barlow
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
the
story
but
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
sir
if
you
will
inform
me
what
kind
of
an
animal
a
camel
is
the
camel
answered
mr
barlow
is
chiefly
found
in
those
burning
climates
which
you
have
heard
described
his
height
is
very
great
rising
to
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
reckoning
to
the
top
of
his
head
his
legs
are
long
and
slender
his
body
not
large
and
his
neck
of
an
amazing
length
this
animal
is
found
in
no
part
of
the
world
that
we
are
acquainted
with
wild
or
free
but
the
whole
race
is
enslaved
by
man
and
brought
up
to
drudgery
from
the
first
moment
of
their
existence
as
soon
as
he
is
born
they
seize
him
and
force
him
to
recline
upon
the
ground
with
his
legs
doubled
up
under
his
belly
to
keep
him
in
this
attitude
they
extend
a
piece
of
canvass
over
his
body
and
fix
it
to
the
ground
by
laying
heavy
weights
upon
the
edge
in
this
manner
he
is
tutored
to
obedience
and
taught
to
kneel
down
at
the
orders
of
his
master
and
receive
the
burthens
which
he
is
destined
to
transport
in
his
temper
he
is
gentle
and
tractable
and
his
patience
in
bearing
thirst
and
hunger
is
superior
to
that
of
any
animal
we
are
acquainted
with
he
is
driven
across
the
burning
desert
loaded
with
the
merchandise
of
those
countries
and
frequently
does
not
even
find
water
to
quench
his
thirst
for
several
days
as
to
his
food
it
is
nothing
but
a
few
herbs
which
are
found
in
the
least
barren
parts
of
the
deserts
and
prickly
bushes
upon
which
he
browses
as
a
delicacy
sometimes
he
does
not
find
even
these
for
many
days
yet
pursues
his
journey
with
a
degree
of
patience
which
is
hardly
credible
we
mounted
our
camels
continued
chares
soon
had
reached
the
confines
of
the
fertile
plains
of
egypt
the
way
as
we
proceeded
grew
sensibly
more
dreary
and
disagreeable
yet
was
sometimes
varied
with
little
tufts
of
trees
and
scanty
patches
of
herbage
but
these
at
length
entirely
disappeared
and
nothing
was
seen
on
every
side
but
an
immense
extent
of
barren
sands
destitute
of
vegetation
and
parched
by
the
continual
heat
of
the
sun
no
sound
was
heard
to
interrupt
the
dreary
silence
that
reigned
around
no
traces
of
inhabitants
perceivable
and
the
gloomy
uniformity
of
the
prospect
inspired
the
soul
with
melancholy
in
the
meantime
the
sun
seemed
to
shoot
down
perpendicular
rays
upon
our
heads
without
a
cloud
to
mitigate
his
violence
i
felt
a
burning
fever
take
possession
of
my
body
my
tongue
was
scorched
with
intolerable
heat
and
it
was
in
vain
i
endeavoured
to
moisten
my
mouth
with
repeated
draughts
of
water
at
night
we
came
to
a
little
rising
ground
at
the
foot
of
which
we
perceived
some
aquatic
herbs
and
a
small
quantity
of
muddy
water
of
which
our
camels
took
prodigious
draughts
here
we
spread
our
tents
and
encamped
for
the
night
with
the
morning
we
pursued
our
journey
but
had
not
proceeded
far
before
we
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
that
seemed
to
rise
along
the
desert
and
as
we
approached
nearer
we
easily
distinguished
the
glitter
of
arms
that
reflected
the
rising
sun
this
was
a
band
of
the
arabians
that
had
discovered
us
and
came
to
know
our
intentions
as
they
advanced
they
spurred
their
horses
which
are
the
most
fleet
and
excellent
in
the
world
and
bounded
along
the
desert
with
the
lightness
of
an
antelope
at
the
same
time
they
brandished
their
lances
and
seemed
prepared
alike
for
war
or
peace
but
when
they
saw
that
we
had
neither
the
intention
nor
the
power
to
commit
hostilities
they
stopped
their
coursers
at
the
distance
of
a
few
paces
from
us
and
he
that
appeared
the
chief
advanced
and
with
a
firm
but
mild
tone
of
voice
inquired
into
the
reason
of
our
coming
it
was
then
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
addressing
him
in
his
own
language
to
which
i
had
for
some
time
applied
myself
before
my
journey
i
explained
to
him
my
curiosity
which
led
me
to
observe
in
person
the
manners
of
a
people
who
are
celebrated
over
the
whole
world
for
having
preserved
their
native
simplicity
unaltered
and
their
liberty
unviolated
amidst
the
revolutions
which
agitate
all
the
neighbouring
nations
i
then
offered
him
the
loading
of
my
camel
which
i
had
brought
not
as
being
worthy
his
acceptance
but
as
a
slight
testimony
of
my
regard
and
concluded
with
remarking
that
the
fidelity
of
the
arabians
in
observing
their
engagements
was
unimpeached
in
a
single
instance
and
therefore
relying
upon
the
integrity
of
my
own
intentions
i
had
come
a
painful
journey
unarmed
and
almost
alone
to
put
myself
into
their
power
and
demand
the
sacred
rights
of
hospitality
i
was
thus
speaking
he
looked
at
me
with
penetration
that
seemed
to
read
into
my
very
soul
and
when
i
had
finished
he
extended
his
arm
with
a
smile
of
benevolence
and
welcomed
me
to
their
tribe
telling
me
at
the
same
time
that
they
admitted
me
as
their
guest
and
received
me
with
the
arms
of
friendship
that
their
method
of
life
like
their
manners
was
coarse
and
simple
but
that
i
might
consider
myself
as
safer
in
their
tents
and
more
removed
from
violence
or
treachery
than
in
the
crowded
cities
which
i
had
left
the
rest
of
the
squadron
then
approached
and
all
saluted
me
as
a
friend
and
brother
we
then
struck
off
across
the
desert
and
after
a
few
hours
march
approached
the
encampment
where
they
had
left
their
wives
and
children
people
is
the
most
singular
and
in
many
respects
the
most
admirable
of
all
that
inhabit
this
globe
of
earth
all
other
nations
are
subject
to
revolutions
and
the
various
turns
of
fortune
sometimes
they
wage
successful
wars
sometimes
they
improve
in
the
arts
of
peace
now
they
are
great
and
reverenced
by
their
neighbours
and
now
insulted
and
despised
they
suffer
all
the
miseries
of
servitude
the
arabians
alone
have
never
been
known
to
vary
in
the
smallest
circumstance
either
of
their
internal
policy
or
external
situation
they
inhabit
a
climate
which
would
be
intolerable
to
the
rest
of
the
human
species
for
its
burning
heat
and
a
soil
which
refuses
to
furnish
any
of
the
necessaries
of
life
hence
they
neither
plough
the
earth
nor
sow
nor
depend
upon
corn
for
their
subsistence
nor
are
acquainted
with
any
of
the
mechanic
arts
they
live
chiefly
upon
the
milk
of
their
herds
and
flocks
and
sometimes
eat
their
flesh
these
burning
deserts
are
stretched
out
to
an
immense
extent
on
every
side
and
these
they
consider
as
their
common
country
without
having
any
fixed
or
permanent
abode
arid
and
barren
as
are
these
wilds
in
general
there
are
various
spots
which
are
more
productive
than
the
rest
here
are
found
supplies
of
water
and
some
appearances
of
vegetation
and
here
the
arabians
encamp
till
they
have
exhausted
the
spontaneous
products
of
the
soil
besides
they
vary
their
place
of
residence
with
the
different
seasons
of
the
year
when
they
are
in
perfect
friendship
with
their
neighbours
they
advance
to
the
very
edges
of
the
desert
and
find
more
ample
supplies
of
moisture
and
herbage
if
they
are
attacked
or
molested
the
whole
tribe
is
in
motion
in
an
instant
and
seeks
a
refuge
in
their
impenetrable
recesses
other
nations
are
involved
in
various
pursuits
of
war
or
government
or
commerce
they
have
made
a
thousand
inventions
of
luxury
necessary
to
their
welfare
and
the
enjoyment
of
these
they
call
the
arab
is
ignorant
of
all
these
things
or
if
he
knows
them
he
despises
their
possession
all
his
wants
his
passions
his
desires
terminate
in
one
object
and
that
object
is
the
preservation
of
his
liberty
for
this
purpose
he
contents
himself
with
a
bare
sufficiency
of
the
coarsest
and
simplest
food
and
the
small
quantity
of
clothing
which
he
requires
in
such
a
climate
is
fabricated
by
the
women
of
the
tribe
who
milk
the
cattle
and
prepare
the
food
of
their
husbands
and
require
no
other
pleasures
than
the
pleasing
interest
of
domestic
cares
they
have
a
breed
of
horses
superior
to
any
in
the
rest
of
the
globe
for
gentleness
patience
and
unrivalled
swiftness
this
is
a
particular
passion
and
pride
of
the
arabian
tribes
these
horses
are
necessary
to
them
in
their
warlike
expeditions
and
in
their
courses
along
the
deserts
if
they
are
attacked
they
mount
their
steeds
who
bear
them
with
the
rapidity
of
a
tempest
to
avenge
their
injuries
or
should
they
be
overmatched
in
fight
they
soon
transport
them
beyond
the
possibility
of
pursuit
for
this
reason
the
proudest
monarchs
and
greatest
conquerors
have
in
vain
attempted
to
subdue
them
troops
accustomed
to
the
plenty
of
a
cultivated
country
are
little
able
to
pursue
these
winged
warriors
over
the
whole
extent
of
their
sandy
wastes
oppressed
with
heat
fainting
for
want
of
water
and
spent
with
the
various
difficulties
of
the
way
the
most
numerous
armies
have
been
destroyed
in
such
attempts
and
those
that
survived
the
obstacles
of
nature
were
easily
overcome
by
the
repeated
attacks
of
the
valiant
natives
i
was
in
this
country
i
was
myself
witness
to
an
embassy
that
was
sent
from
the
neighbouring
prince
who
imagined
that
the
fame
of
his
exploits
had
struck
the
arabians
with
terror
and
disposed
them
to
submission
the
ambassador
was
introduced
to
the
chief
of
the
tribe
a
venerable
old
man
undistinguished
by
any
mark
of
ostentation
from
the
rest
who
received
him
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
tent
he
then
began
to
speak
and
in
a
long
and
studied
harangue
described
the
power
of
his
master
the
invincible
courage
of
his
armies
the
vast
profusion
of
arms
of
warlike
engines
and
military
stores
and
concluded
with
a
demand
that
the
arabians
should
submit
to
acknowledge
him
as
their
lord
and
pay
a
yearly
tribute
this
proud
speech
the
younger
part
of
the
tribe
began
to
frown
with
indignation
and
clash
their
weapons
in
token
of
defiance
but
the
chief
himself
with
a
calm
and
manly
composure
made
this
reply
expected
from
the
maturity
of
your
age
and
the
gravity
of
your
countenance
to
have
heard
a
rational
discourse
befitting
you
to
propose
and
us
to
hear
when
you
dwelt
so
long
upon
the
power
of
your
master
i
also
imagined
that
he
had
sent
to
us
to
propose
a
league
of
friendship
and
alliance
such
as
might
become
equals
and
bind
man
more
closely
to
his
fellows
in
this
case
the
arabians
although
they
neither
want
the
assistance
nor
fear
the
attacks
of
any
king
or
nation
would
gladly
have
consented
because
it
has
been
always
their
favourite
maxim
neither
to
leave
injuries
unpunished
nor
to
be
outdone
in
kindness
and
hospitality
but
since
you
have
come
thus
far
to
deliver
a
message
which
must
needs
be
disagreeable
to
the
ears
of
men
who
acknowledge
no
superior
upon
earth
you
may
thus
report
the
sentiments
of
the
arabians
to
him
that
sent
you
you
may
tell
him
that
as
to
the
land
which
we
inhabit
it
is
neither
the
gift
of
him
nor
any
of
his
forefathers
we
hold
it
from
our
ancestors
who
received
it
in
turn
from
theirs
by
the
common
laws
of
nature
which
has
adapted
particular
countries
and
soils
not
only
to
man
but
to
all
the
various
animals
which
she
has
produced
if
therefore
your
king
imagines
that
he
has
a
right
to
retain
the
country
which
he
and
his
people
now
inhabit
by
the
same
tenure
do
the
arabians
hold
the
sovereignty
of
these
barren
sands
where
the
bones
of
our
ancestors
have
been
buried
even
from
the
first
foundation
of
the
world
but
you
have
described
to
us
in
pompous
language
the
extraordinary
power
and
riches
of
your
king
according
to
you
he
not
only
commands
numerous
and
troops
of
warlike
men
furnished
with
every
species
of
military
stores
but
he
also
possesses
immense
heaps
of
gold
silver
and
other
precious
commodities
and
his
country
affords
him
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
corn
and
oil
and
wine
and
all
the
other
conveniences
of
life
if
therefore
these
representations
be
false
you
must
appear
a
vain
and
despicable
babbler
who
being
induced
by
no
sufficient
reason
have
come
hither
of
your
own
accord
to
amuse
us
a
plain
and
simple
race
of
men
with
specious
tales
and
fables
but
if
your
words
be
true
your
king
must
be
equally
unjust
and
foolish
who
already
possessing
all
these
advantages
doth
still
insatiably
grasp
after
more
and
enjoying
so
many
good
things
with
ease
and
security
to
himself
will
rather
put
them
to
all
the
hazard
than
repress
the
vain
desires
of
his
own
intolerable
avarice
as
to
the
tribute
which
you
have
demanded
what
you
have
already
seen
of
the
arabians
and
their
country
affords
you
a
sufficient
answer
you
see
that
we
have
neither
cities
nor
fields
nor
rivers
nor
wine
nor
oil
gold
and
silver
are
equally
unknown
among
us
and
the
arabians
abandoning
all
these
things
to
other
men
have
at
the
same
time
delivered
themselves
from
the
necessity
of
being
slaves
which
is
the
general
law
by
which
all
mortals
retain
their
possession
we
have
therefore
nothing
which
we
can
send
as
a
tribute
but
the
sand
of
these
our
deserts
and
the
arrows
and
lances
with
which
we
have
hitherto
defended
them
from
all
invaders
if
these
are
treasures
worthy
of
his
acceptance
he
may
lead
his
conquering
troops
to
take
possession
of
our
country
but
he
will
find
men
who
are
not
softened
by
luxury
or
vanquished
by
their
own
vices
men
who
prize
their
liberty
at
a
dearer
rate
than
all
other
mortals
do
their
riches
or
their
lives
and
to
whom
dishonour
is
more
formidable
than
wounds
and
death
if
he
can
vanquish
such
men
it
will
however
become
his
prudence
to
reflect
whether
he
can
vanquish
the
obstacles
which
nature
herself
has
opposed
to
his
ambition
if
he
should
attempt
to
pass
our
deserts
he
will
have
to
struggle
with
famine
and
consuming
thirst
from
which
no
enemy
has
hitherto
escaped
even
when
he
has
failed
to
perish
by
the
arrows
of
the
arabians
and
generous
people
exclaimed
sophron
well
do
they
deserve
the
liberty
they
enjoy
with
such
sentiments
they
need
not
fear
the
attack
of
kings
or
conquerors
it
is
the
vices
of
men
and
not
the
weakness
of
their
nature
that
basely
enslave
them
to
their
equals
and
he
that
prizes
liberty
beyond
a
few
contemptible
pleasures
of
his
senses
may
be
certain
that
no
human
force
can
ever
bereave
him
of
so
great
a
good
sentiments
replied
chares
me
that
i
have
not
made
a
false
estimate
of
the
inhabitants
of
these
mountainous
districts
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
been
so
particular
in
the
description
of
egypt
and
arabia
i
wished
to
know
whether
the
general
spirit
of
indolence
and
pusillanimity
had
infected
the
hardy
inhabitants
of
lebanon
but
from
the
generous
enthusiasm
which
animates
your
countenance
at
the
recital
of
noble
actions
as
well
as
from
what
i
have
experienced
you
are
capable
of
attempting
i
trust
that
these
solitary
scenes
are
uninfected
with
the
vices
that
have
deluged
the
rest
of
asia
and
bent
its
inhabitants
to
the
yoke
here
the
impatience
of
tommy
which
had
been
increasing
a
considerable
time
could
no
longer
be
restrained
and
he
could
not
help
interrupting
the
story
by
addressing
mr
barlow
thus
sir
will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
a
question
as
many
as
you
choose
in
all
these
stories
which
i
have
heard
it
seems
as
if
those
nations
that
have
little
or
nothing
are
more
and
better
and
braver
than
those
that
have
a
great
deal
this
is
indeed
sometimes
the
case
but
then
why
should
it
not
be
the
case
here
as
well
as
in
other
places
are
all
the
poor
in
this
country
better
than
the
rich
it
should
seem
answered
mr
barlow
smiling
as
if
you
were
of
that
opinion
why
so
sir
because
whatever
you
want
to
have
done
i
observe
that
you
always
address
yourself
to
the
poor
and
not
to
the
rich
yes
sir
but
that
is
a
different
case
the
poor
are
used
to
do
many
things
which
the
rich
never
do
are
these
things
useful
or
not
useful
why
to
be
sure
many
of
them
are
extremely
useful
for
since
i
have
acquired
so
much
knowledge
i
find
they
cultivate
the
ground
to
raise
corn
and
build
houses
and
hammer
iron
which
is
so
necessary
to
make
everything
we
use
besides
feeding
cattle
and
dressing
our
victuals
and
washing
our
clothes
and
in
short
doing
everything
which
is
necessary
to
be
done
what
do
the
poor
do
all
these
things
yes
indeed
or
else
they
never
would
be
done
for
it
would
be
a
very
ungenteel
thing
to
labour
at
a
forge
like
a
blacksmith
or
hold
the
plough
like
the
farmer
or
build
a
house
like
a
bricklayer
and
did
not
you
build
a
house
in
my
garden
some
little
time
ago
yes
sir
but
that
was
only
for
my
amusement
it
was
not
intended
for
anybody
to
live
in
so
you
still
think
it
is
the
first
qualification
of
a
gentleman
never
to
do
anything
useful
and
he
that
does
anything
with
that
design
ceases
to
be
a
gentleman
tommy
looked
a
little
ashamed
at
this
but
he
said
it
was
not
so
much
his
own
opinion
as
that
of
the
other
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
whom
he
had
conversed
but
replied
mr
barlow
you
asked
just
now
which
were
the
best
the
rich
or
the
poor
but
if
the
poor
provide
food
and
clothing
and
houses
and
everything
else
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
all
the
rich
while
the
rich
do
nothing
at
all
it
must
appear
that
the
poor
are
better
than
the
rich
yes
sir
but
then
the
poor
do
not
act
in
that
manner
out
of
kindness
but
because
they
are
obliged
to
it
that
indeed
is
a
better
argument
than
you
sometimes
use
but
tell
me
which
set
of
people
would
you
prefer
those
that
are
always
doing
useful
things
because
they
are
obliged
to
it
or
those
who
never
do
anything
useful
at
all
indeed
sir
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
but
when
i
asked
the
question
i
did
not
so
much
mean
the
doing
useful
things
but
now
i
think
of
it
the
rich
do
a
great
deal
of
good
by
buying
the
things
of
the
poor
and
giving
them
money
in
return
what
is
money
money
sir
money
is
i
believe
little
pieces
of
silver
and
gold
with
a
head
upon
them
and
what
is
the
use
of
those
little
pieces
of
silver
and
gold
indeed
i
do
not
know
that
they
are
of
any
use
but
everybody
has
agreed
to
take
them
and
therefore
you
may
buy
with
them
whatever
you
want
then
according
to
your
last
account
the
goodness
of
the
rich
consists
in
taking
from
the
poor
houses
clothes
and
food
and
giving
them
in
return
little
bits
of
silver
and
gold
which
are
really
good
for
nothing
yes
sir
but
then
the
poor
can
take
these
pieces
of
money
and
purchase
everything
which
they
want
you
mean
that
if
a
poor
man
has
money
in
his
pocket
he
can
always
exchange
it
for
clothes
or
food
or
any
other
necessary
indeed
i
do
sir
but
whom
must
he
buy
them
of
for
according
to
your
account
the
rich
never
produce
any
of
these
things
therefore
the
poor
if
they
want
to
purchase
them
can
only
do
so
of
each
other
but
sir
i
can
not
think
that
is
always
the
case
for
i
have
been
along
with
my
mamma
to
shops
where
there
were
fine
powdered
gentlemen
and
ladies
that
sold
things
to
other
people
and
and
young
ladies
that
played
on
the
harpsichord
like
miss
matilda
but
my
good
little
friend
do
you
imagine
that
these
fine
powdered
gentlemen
and
ladies
made
the
things
which
they
sold
that
sir
i
can
not
tell
but
i
should
rather
imagine
not
for
all
the
fine
people
i
have
ever
seen
are
too
much
afraid
of
spoiling
their
clothes
to
work
all
that
they
do
then
is
to
employ
poorer
persons
to
work
for
them
while
they
only
sell
what
is
produced
by
their
labour
so
that
still
you
see
we
reach
no
farther
than
this
the
rich
do
nothing
and
produce
nothing
and
the
poor
everything
that
is
really
useful
were
there
a
whole
nation
of
rich
people
they
would
all
be
starved
like
the
spaniard
in
the
story
because
no
one
would
condescend
to
produce
anything
and
this
would
happen
in
spite
of
all
their
money
unless
they
had
neighbours
who
were
poorer
to
supply
them
but
a
nation
that
was
poor
might
be
industrious
and
gradually
supply
themselves
with
all
they
wanted
and
then
it
would
be
of
little
consequence
whether
they
had
pieces
of
metal
with
heads
upon
them
or
not
but
this
conversation
has
lasted
long
enough
at
present
and
as
you
are
now
going
to
bed
i
daresay
miss
simmons
will
be
so
good
as
to
defer
the
remainder
of
her
story
until
the
next
day
tommy
rose
before
his
father
and
mother
and
as
his
imagination
had
been
forcibly
acted
on
by
the
description
he
had
heard
of
the
arabian
horsemen
he
desired
his
little
horse
might
be
saddled
and
that
william
his
father
man
would
attend
him
upon
a
ride
unfortunately
for
tommy
his
vivacity
was
greater
than
his
reason
and
his
taste
for
imitation
was
continually
leading
him
into
some
mischief
or
misfortune
he
had
no
sooner
been
introduced
into
the
acquaintance
of
genteel
life
than
he
threw
aside
all
his
former
habits
and
longed
to
distinguish
himself
as
a
most
accomplished
young
gentleman
he
was
now
in
turn
sickened
and
disgusted
with
fashionable
affectation
and
his
mind
at
leisure
for
fresh
impressions
was
ready
to
catch
at
the
first
new
object
which
occurred
the
idea
therefore
which
presented
itself
to
his
mind
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
eyes
was
that
of
being
an
arabian
horseman
nothing
he
imagined
could
equal
the
pleasure
of
guiding
a
fiery
steed
over
those
immense
and
desolate
wastes
which
he
had
heard
described
in
the
meantime
as
the
country
where
he
wished
to
exhibit
was
at
too
great
a
distance
he
thought
he
might
excite
some
applause
even
upon
the
common
before
his
father
house
full
of
this
idea
he
rose
put
on
his
boots
and
summoned
william
to
attend
him
william
had
been
too
much
accustomed
to
humour
all
his
caprices
to
make
any
difficulty
of
obeying
him
and
as
he
had
often
ridden
out
with
his
young
master
before
he
did
not
foresee
the
least
possible
inconvenience
but
the
maternal
care
of
mrs
merton
had
made
it
an
indispensable
condition
with
her
son
that
he
should
never
presume
to
ride
with
spurs
and
she
had
strictly
enjoined
all
the
servants
never
to
supply
him
with
those
dangerous
accoutrements
tommy
had
long
murmured
in
secret
at
this
prohibition
which
seemed
to
imply
a
distrust
of
his
abilities
in
horsemanship
which
sensibly
wounded
his
pride
but
since
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
emulate
the
arabs
themselves
and
perhaps
excel
them
in
their
own
art
he
considered
it
as
no
longer
possible
to
endure
the
disgrace
but
as
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
strict
injunction
which
had
been
given
to
all
the
servants
he
did
not
dare
to
make
the
experiment
of
soliciting
their
assistance
while
he
was
in
this
embarrassment
a
new
and
sudden
expedient
presented
itself
to
his
fertile
genius
which
he
instantly
resolved
to
adopt
tommy
went
to
his
mamma
maid
and
without
difficulty
obtained
from
her
a
couple
of
the
pins
which
he
thrust
through
the
leather
of
his
boots
and
thus
accoutred
he
mounted
his
horse
without
suspicion
or
observation
tommy
had
not
ridden
far
before
he
began
to
give
vent
to
his
reigning
passion
and
asked
william
if
he
had
ever
seen
an
arabian
on
horseback
the
answer
of
william
sufficiently
proved
his
ignorance
which
tommy
kindly
undertook
to
remove
by
giving
him
a
detail
of
all
the
particulars
he
had
heard
the
preceding
night
but
unfortunately
the
eloquence
of
tommy
precipitated
him
into
a
dangerous
experiment
for
just
as
he
was
describing
their
rapid
flight
across
the
deserts
the
interest
of
his
subject
so
transported
him
that
he
closed
his
legs
upon
his
little
horse
and
pricked
him
in
so
sensible
a
manner
that
the
pony
who
was
not
deficient
in
spirit
resented
the
attack
and
set
off
with
him
at
a
prodigious
rate
william
when
he
saw
his
master
thus
burst
forth
was
at
a
loss
whether
to
consider
it
an
accident
or
only
an
oratorical
grace
but
seeing
the
horse
hurrying
along
the
roughest
part
of
the
common
while
tommy
tugged
in
vain
to
restrain
his
efforts
he
thought
it
necessary
to
endeavour
to
overtake
him
and
therefore
pursued
him
with
all
the
speed
he
could
use
but
the
pony
whose
blood
seemed
to
be
only
the
more
inflamed
by
the
violence
of
his
own
exertions
ran
the
faster
when
he
heard
the
trampling
of
another
horse
behind
him
in
this
manner
did
tommy
scamper
over
the
common
while
william
pursued
in
vain
for
just
as
the
servant
thought
he
had
reached
his
master
his
horse
would
push
forward
with
such
rapidity
as
left
his
pursuer
far
behind
tommy
kept
his
seat
with
infinite
address
but
he
now
began
seriously
to
repent
of
his
own
ungovernable
ambition
and
would
with
the
greatest
pleasure
have
exchanged
his
own
spirited
steed
for
the
dullest
ass
in
england
the
race
had
now
endured
a
considerable
time
and
seemed
to
be
no
nearer
to
a
conclusion
when
on
a
sudden
the
pony
turned
short
upon
an
attempt
of
his
master
to
stop
him
and
rushed
precipitately
into
a
large
bog
or
quagmire
which
was
full
before
him
here
he
made
him
a
momentary
halt
and
tommy
wisely
embraced
the
opportunity
of
letting
himself
slide
off
upon
a
soft
and
yielding
bed
of
mire
the
servant
now
came
up
to
tommy
and
rescued
him
from
his
disagreeable
situation
where
however
he
had
received
no
other
damage
than
that
of
daubing
himself
all
over
william
had
been
at
first
very
much
frightened
at
the
danger
of
his
master
but
when
he
saw
that
he
had
so
luckily
escaped
all
hurt
he
could
not
help
asking
him
with
a
smile
whether
this
too
was
a
stroke
of
arabian
horsemanship
tommy
was
a
little
provoked
at
this
reflection
upon
his
horsemanship
but
as
he
had
now
lost
something
of
his
irritability
by
repeated
mortification
he
wisely
repressed
his
passion
and
desired
william
to
catch
his
horse
while
he
returned
homewards
on
foot
to
warm
himself
the
servant
therefore
endeavoured
to
approach
the
pony
who
as
if
contented
with
the
triumph
he
had
obtained
over
his
rider
was
quietly
feeding
at
a
little
distance
but
the
instant
william
approached
he
set
off
again
at
a
violent
rate
and
seemed
disposed
to
lead
him
a
second
chase
not
inferior
to
the
first
in
the
meantime
tommy
walked
pensively
along
the
common
reflecting
on
the
various
accidents
which
had
befallen
him
and
the
repeated
disappointments
he
had
found
in
all
his
attempts
to
distinguish
himself
while
he
was
thus
engaged
he
overtook
a
poor
and
ragged
figure
the
singularity
of
whose
appearance
engaged
his
attention
it
was
a
man
of
middle
age
in
a
dress
he
had
never
seen
before
with
two
poor
children
that
seemed
with
difficulty
to
keep
up
with
him
while
he
carried
a
third
in
his
arms
whose
pale
emaciated
looks
sufficiently
declared
disease
and
pain
the
man
had
upon
his
head
a
coarse
blue
bonnet
instead
of
a
hat
he
was
wrapped
round
by
a
tattered
kind
of
garment
striped
with
various
colours
and
at
his
side
hung
down
a
long
and
formidable
sword
tommy
surveyed
him
with
such
an
earnest
observation
that
at
length
the
man
took
notice
of
it
and
bowing
to
him
with
the
greatest
civility
ventured
to
ask
him
if
he
had
met
with
any
accident
that
he
appeared
in
a
disorder
which
suited
so
little
with
his
quality
tommy
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
discernment
of
the
man
who
could
distinguish
his
importance
in
spite
of
the
dirtiness
of
his
clothes
and
therefore
mildly
answered
no
friend
there
is
not
much
the
matter
i
have
a
little
obstinate
horse
that
ran
away
with
me
and
after
trying
in
vain
to
throw
me
down
he
plunged
into
the
middle
of
that
great
bog
there
and
so
i
jumped
off
for
fear
of
being
swallowed
up
otherwise
i
should
soon
have
made
him
submit
for
i
am
used
to
such
things
and
do
mind
them
in
the
least
here
the
child
that
the
man
was
carrying
began
to
cry
bitterly
and
the
father
endeavoured
to
pacify
him
but
in
vain
poor
thing
said
tommy
he
seems
to
be
unwell
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
him
alas
master
answered
the
man
he
is
not
well
indeed
he
has
now
a
violent
ague
fit
upon
him
and
i
have
not
had
a
morsel
of
bread
to
give
him
or
any
of
the
rest
since
yesterday
noon
tommy
was
naturally
generous
and
now
his
mind
was
unusually
softened
by
the
remembrance
of
his
own
recent
distresses
he
therefore
pulled
a
shilling
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
man
saying
here
my
honest
friend
here
is
something
to
buy
your
child
some
food
and
i
sincerely
wish
he
may
soon
recover
god
bless
your
sweet
face
said
the
man
you
are
the
best
friend
i
have
seen
this
many
a
day
but
for
this
kind
assistance
we
might
have
been
all
lost
he
then
with
many
bows
and
thanks
struck
across
the
common
into
a
different
path
and
tommy
went
forward
feeling
a
greater
pleasure
at
this
little
act
of
humanity
than
he
had
long
been
acquainted
with
among
all
the
fine
acquaintance
he
had
lately
contracted
but
he
had
walked
a
very
little
way
with
these
reflections
before
he
met
with
a
new
adventure
a
flock
of
sheep
was
running
with
all
the
precipitation
which
fear
could
inspire
from
the
pursuit
of
a
large
dog
and
just
as
tommy
approached
the
dog
had
overtaken
a
lamb
and
seemed
disposed
to
devour
it
tommy
was
naturally
an
enemy
to
all
cruelty
and
therefore
running
towards
the
dog
with
more
alacrity
than
prudence
he
endeavoured
to
drive
him
from
his
prey
but
the
animal
who
probably
despised
the
diminutive
size
of
his
adversary
after
growling
a
little
while
and
showing
his
teeth
when
he
found
that
this
was
not
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
intermeddling
entirely
quitted
the
sheep
and
making
a
sudden
spring
seized
upon
the
skirt
of
tommy
coat
which
he
shook
with
every
expression
of
rage
tommy
behaved
with
more
intrepidity
than
could
have
been
expected
for
he
neither
cried
out
nor
attempted
to
run
but
made
his
utmost
efforts
to
disengage
himself
from
his
enemy
but
as
the
contest
was
so
unequal
it
is
probable
he
would
have
been
severely
bitten
had
not
the
honest
stranger
whom
he
had
relieved
come
running
up
to
his
assistance
and
seeing
the
danger
of
his
benefactor
laid
the
dog
dead
at
his
feet
by
a
furious
stroke
of
his
broadsword
tommy
thus
delivered
from
impending
danger
expressed
his
gratitude
to
the
stranger
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
and
desired
him
to
accompany
him
to
his
father
house
where
he
and
his
wearied
children
should
receive
whatever
refreshment
they
wished
he
then
turned
his
eyes
to
the
lamb
which
had
been
the
cause
of
the
contest
and
lay
panting
upon
the
ground
bleeding
and
wounded
but
not
to
death
and
remarked
with
astonishment
upon
his
fleece
the
characters
of
accompanied
with
a
cross
as
i
live
said
tommy
i
believe
this
is
the
very
lamb
which
harry
used
to
be
so
fond
of
and
which
would
sometimes
follow
him
to
mr
barlow
i
am
the
luckiest
fellow
in
the
world
to
have
come
in
time
to
deliver
him
and
now
perhaps
harry
may
forgive
me
all
the
he
has
met
with
saying
this
he
took
the
lamb
up
and
kissed
it
with
the
greatest
tenderness
nay
he
would
have
even
borne
it
home
in
his
arms
had
it
not
been
rather
too
heavy
for
his
strength
but
the
honest
stranger
with
a
grateful
officiousness
offered
his
services
and
prevailed
on
tommy
to
let
him
carry
it
while
he
delivered
his
child
to
the
biggest
of
his
brothers
when
tommy
had
now
arrived
within
a
little
distance
of
his
home
he
met
his
father
and
mr
barlow
who
had
left
the
house
to
enjoy
the
morning
air
before
breakfast
they
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
such
an
equipage
for
the
dirt
which
had
bespattered
him
from
head
to
foot
began
to
dry
in
various
places
and
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
farmer
wall
in
the
act
of
hardening
but
tommy
without
giving
them
time
to
make
inquiries
ran
affectionately
up
to
mr
barlow
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
oh
sir
here
is
the
luckiest
accident
in
the
world
poor
harry
sandford
favourite
lamb
would
have
been
killed
by
a
great
mischievous
dog
if
i
had
not
happened
to
come
by
and
save
his
life
and
who
is
this
honest
man
said
mr
merton
whom
you
have
picked
up
on
the
common
he
seems
to
be
in
distress
and
his
famished
children
are
scarcely
able
to
drag
themselves
along
poor
man
answered
tommy
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
him
for
when
i
went
to
save
harry
lamb
the
dog
attacked
me
and
would
have
hurt
me
very
much
if
he
had
not
come
to
my
assistance
and
killed
him
with
his
great
sword
so
i
have
brought
him
with
me
that
he
might
refresh
himself
with
his
poor
children
one
of
which
has
a
terrible
ague
for
i
knew
papa
that
though
i
had
not
behaved
well
of
late
you
would
not
be
against
my
doing
an
act
of
charity
i
am
on
the
contrary
very
glad
said
mr
merton
to
see
you
have
so
much
gratitude
in
your
temper
but
what
is
the
reason
that
i
see
you
thus
disfigured
with
dirt
surely
you
must
have
been
riding
and
your
horse
has
thrown
you
and
so
it
is
for
here
is
william
following
with
both
the
horses
in
a
foam
william
at
that
moment
appeared
and
trotting
up
to
his
master
began
to
make
excuses
for
his
own
share
in
the
business
indeed
sir
said
he
i
did
not
think
there
was
the
least
harm
in
going
out
with
master
tommy
and
we
were
riding
along
as
quietly
as
possible
and
master
was
giving
me
a
long
account
of
the
arabs
who
he
said
lived
in
the
finest
country
in
the
world
which
does
not
produce
anything
to
eat
or
drink
or
wear
and
yet
they
never
want
to
come
upon
the
parish
but
ride
upon
the
most
mettled
horses
in
the
world
fit
to
start
for
any
plate
in
england
and
just
as
he
was
giving
me
this
account
punch
took
it
into
his
head
to
run
away
and
while
i
was
endeavouring
to
catch
him
he
jumped
into
a
quagmire
and
shot
master
tommy
off
in
the
middle
of
it
no
said
tommy
there
you
mistake
i
believe
i
could
manage
a
much
more
spirited
horse
than
punch
but
i
thought
it
prudent
to
throw
myself
off
for
fear
of
his
plunging
deeper
into
the
mire
but
how
is
this
said
mr
merton
the
pony
used
to
be
the
quietest
of
horses
what
can
have
given
him
this
sudden
impulse
to
run
away
surely
william
you
were
not
so
imprudent
as
to
trust
your
master
with
spurs
no
sir
answered
william
not
i
and
i
can
take
my
oath
he
had
no
spurs
on
when
he
first
set
out
mr
merton
was
convinced
there
was
some
mystery
in
this
transaction
and
looking
at
his
son
to
find
it
out
he
at
length
discovered
the
ingenious
contrivance
of
tommy
to
supply
the
place
of
spurs
and
could
hardly
preserve
his
gravity
at
the
sight
he
however
mildly
set
before
him
his
imprudence
which
might
have
been
attended
with
the
most
fatal
consequences
the
fracture
of
his
limbs
or
even
the
loss
of
his
life
and
desired
him
for
the
future
to
be
more
cautious
they
then
returned
to
the
house
and
mr
merton
ordered
his
servants
to
supply
his
guests
with
plenty
of
the
most
nourishing
food
after
breakfast
they
sent
for
the
unhappy
stranger
into
the
parlour
whose
countenance
now
bespoke
satisfaction
and
gratitude
and
mr
merton
who
by
his
dress
and
accent
discovered
him
to
be
an
inhabitant
of
scotland
desired
to
know
by
what
accident
he
had
thus
wandered
so
far
from
home
with
these
poor
helpless
children
and
had
been
reduced
to
so
much
misery
alas
your
honour
answered
the
man
i
should
ill
deserve
the
favours
you
have
shown
me
if
i
attempted
to
conceal
anything
from
such
worthy
benefactors
my
tale
however
is
simple
and
uninteresting
and
i
fear
there
can
be
nothing
in
the
story
of
my
distress
the
least
deserving
of
your
attention
surely
said
mr
merton
with
the
most
benevolent
courtesy
there
must
be
something
in
the
distress
of
every
honest
man
which
ought
to
interest
his
and
if
you
will
acquaint
us
with
all
the
circumstances
of
your
situation
it
may
perhaps
be
within
our
power
as
it
certainly
is
in
our
inclinations
to
do
you
further
service
the
man
then
bowed
to
the
company
with
an
air
of
dignity
which
surprised
them
all
and
thus
began
i
was
born
in
that
part
of
our
island
which
is
called
the
north
of
scotland
the
country
there
partly
from
the
barrenness
of
the
soil
and
the
inclemency
of
the
season
and
partly
from
other
causes
which
i
will
not
now
enumerate
is
unfavourable
to
the
existence
of
its
inhabitants
more
than
half
of
the
year
our
mountains
are
covered
with
continual
snows
which
prohibit
the
use
of
agriculture
or
blast
the
expectations
of
a
harvest
yet
the
race
of
men
which
inhabit
these
dreary
wilds
are
perhaps
not
more
undeserving
the
smiles
of
fortune
than
many
of
their
happier
neighbours
accustomed
to
a
life
of
toil
and
hardship
their
bodies
are
braced
by
the
incessant
difficulties
they
have
to
encounter
and
their
minds
remain
untainted
by
the
example
of
their
more
luxurious
neighbours
they
are
bred
up
from
infancy
with
a
deference
and
respect
for
their
parents
and
with
a
mutual
spirit
of
endearment
towards
their
equals
which
i
have
not
remarked
in
happier
climates
these
circumstances
expand
and
elevate
the
mind
and
attach
the
highlanders
to
their
native
mountains
with
a
warmth
of
affection
which
is
scarcely
known
in
the
midst
of
polished
cities
and
cultivated
countries
every
man
there
is
more
or
less
acquainted
with
the
history
of
his
clan
and
the
martial
exploits
which
they
have
performed
in
the
winter
season
we
sit
around
the
blazing
light
of
our
fires
and
commemorate
the
glorious
actions
of
our
ancestors
the
children
catch
the
sound
and
consider
themselves
as
interested
in
supporting
the
honour
of
a
nation
which
is
yet
unsullied
in
the
annals
of
the
world
and
resolve
to
transmit
it
equally
pure
to
their
posterity
with
these
impressions
which
were
the
earliest
i
can
remember
you
can
not
wonder
gentlemen
that
i
should
have
early
imbibed
a
spirit
of
enterprise
and
a
love
of
arms
my
father
was
indeed
poor
but
he
had
been
himself
a
soldier
and
therefore
did
not
so
strenuously
oppose
my
growing
inclination
he
indeed
set
before
me
the
little
chance
i
should
have
of
promotion
and
the
innumerable
difficulties
of
my
intended
profession
but
what
were
difficulties
to
a
youth
brought
up
to
subsist
upon
a
handful
of
oatmeal
to
drink
the
waters
of
the
stream
and
to
sleep
shrouded
in
my
plaid
beneath
the
arch
of
an
impending
rock
i
see
gentlemen
continued
the
highlander
that
you
appear
surprised
to
hear
a
man
who
has
so
little
to
recommend
him
express
himself
in
rather
loftier
language
than
you
are
accustomed
to
among
your
peasantry
here
but
you
should
remember
that
a
certain
degree
of
education
is
more
general
in
scotland
than
where
you
live
and
that
wanting
almost
all
the
gifts
of
fortune
we
can
not
afford
to
suffer
those
of
nature
to
remain
uncultivated
when
therefore
my
father
saw
that
the
determined
bent
of
my
temper
was
towards
a
military
life
he
thought
it
vain
to
oppose
my
inclinations
he
even
perhaps
involuntarily
cherished
them
by
explaining
to
me
during
the
long
leisure
of
our
dreary
winter
some
books
which
treated
of
military
sciences
and
ancient
history
from
these
i
imbibed
an
early
love
of
truth
and
honour
which
i
hope
has
not
abandoned
me
since
and
by
teaching
me
what
brave
and
virtuous
men
have
suffered
in
every
age
and
country
they
have
perhaps
prevented
me
from
entirely
sinking
under
my
misfortunes
one
night
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
as
we
were
seated
round
the
embers
of
our
fire
we
heard
a
knocking
at
the
door
my
father
rose
and
a
man
of
a
majestic
presence
came
in
and
requested
permission
to
pass
the
night
in
our
cottage
he
told
us
he
was
an
english
officer
who
had
long
been
stationed
in
the
highlands
but
now
upon
the
breaking
out
of
war
he
had
been
sent
for
in
haste
to
london
whence
he
was
to
embark
for
america
as
soon
as
he
could
be
joined
by
his
regiment
said
he
been
the
reason
of
my
travelling
later
than
prudence
permits
in
a
mountainous
country
with
which
i
am
imperfectly
acquainted
i
have
unfortunately
lost
my
way
and
but
for
your
kindness
added
he
smiling
must
here
begin
my
campaign
and
pass
the
night
upon
a
bed
of
heath
amid
the
mountains
my
father
rose
and
received
the
officer
with
all
the
courtesy
he
was
able
for
in
scotland
every
man
thinks
himself
honoured
by
being
permitted
to
exercise
his
hospitality
he
told
him
his
accommodations
were
mean
and
poor
but
what
he
had
was
heartily
at
his
service
he
then
sent
me
to
look
after
his
horse
and
set
before
him
some
milk
and
oaten
bread
which
were
all
the
dainties
we
possessed
our
guest
however
seemed
to
feed
upon
it
with
an
appetite
as
keen
as
if
he
had
been
educated
in
the
highlands
and
what
i
could
not
help
remarking
with
astonishment
although
his
air
and
manners
proved
that
he
could
be
no
stranger
to
a
more
delicate
way
of
living
not
a
single
word
fell
from
him
that
intimated
he
had
ever
been
used
to
better
fare
during
the
evening
our
guest
entertained
us
with
various
accounts
of
the
dangers
he
had
already
escaped
and
the
service
he
had
seen
he
particularly
described
the
manners
of
the
savage
tribes
he
was
going
to
encounter
in
america
and
the
nature
of
their
warfare
all
this
accompanied
with
the
tone
and
look
of
a
man
who
was
familiar
with
great
events
and
had
borne
a
considerable
share
in
all
he
related
so
inflamed
my
military
ardour
that
i
was
no
longer
capable
of
repressing
it
the
stranger
perceived
it
and
looking
at
me
with
an
air
of
tenderness
and
compassion
asked
if
that
young
man
was
intended
for
the
service
my
colour
rose
and
my
heart
immediately
swelled
at
the
question
the
look
and
manner
of
our
guest
had
strangely
interested
me
in
his
favour
and
the
natural
grace
and
simplicity
with
which
he
related
his
own
exploits
put
me
in
mind
of
the
great
men
in
other
times
could
i
but
march
under
the
banner
of
such
a
leader
i
thought
nothing
would
be
too
arduous
to
be
achieved
i
saw
before
me
a
long
perspective
of
combats
difficulties
and
dangers
something
however
whispered
to
my
mind
that
i
should
be
successful
in
the
end
and
support
the
reputation
of
our
name
and
clan
full
of
these
ideas
i
sprang
forwards
at
the
question
and
told
the
officer
that
the
darling
passion
of
my
life
would
be
to
bear
arms
under
a
chief
like
him
and
that
if
he
would
suffer
me
to
enlist
under
his
command
i
should
be
ready
to
justify
his
kindness
by
patiently
supporting
every
hardship
and
facing
every
danger
man
replied
he
with
a
look
of
kind
concern
is
not
an
officer
in
the
army
that
would
not
be
proud
of
such
a
recruit
but
i
should
ill
betray
the
hospitality
i
have
received
from
your
parents
if
i
suffered
you
to
be
deceived
in
your
opinion
of
the
military
profession
he
then
set
before
me
in
the
strongest
language
all
the
hardships
which
would
be
my
lot
the
dangers
of
the
field
the
pestilence
of
camps
the
slow
consuming
languor
of
hospitals
the
insolence
of
command
the
mortification
and
subordination
and
the
uncertainty
that
the
exertions
of
even
a
long
life
would
ever
lead
to
the
least
promotion
this
replied
i
trembling
with
fear
that
my
father
should
take
advantage
of
these
too
just
representations
to
refuse
his
consent
knew
before
but
i
feel
an
irresistible
impulse
within
me
which
compels
me
to
the
field
the
die
is
cast
for
life
or
death
and
i
will
abide
by
the
chance
that
now
occurs
if
you
sir
refuse
me
i
will
however
enlist
with
the
first
officer
that
will
accept
me
for
i
will
no
longer
wear
out
life
amid
the
solitude
of
these
surrounding
mountains
without
either
a
chance
of
meriting
applause
or
distinguishing
my
name
the
officer
then
desisted
from
his
opposition
and
turning
to
my
parents
asked
them
if
it
were
with
their
consent
that
i
was
going
to
enlist
my
mother
burst
into
tears
and
my
sisters
hung
about
me
weeping
my
father
replied
with
a
deep
sigh
have
long
experienced
that
it
is
in
vain
to
oppose
the
decrees
of
providence
could
my
persuasions
have
availed
he
would
have
remained
contented
in
these
mountains
but
that
is
now
impossible
at
least
till
he
has
purchased
wisdom
at
the
price
of
his
blood
if
therefore
sir
you
do
not
despise
his
youth
and
mien
take
him
with
you
and
let
him
have
the
advantage
of
your
example
i
have
been
a
soldier
myself
and
i
can
assure
you
with
truth
that
i
have
never
seen
an
officer
under
whom
i
would
more
gladly
march
than
yourself
our
guest
made
a
polite
reply
to
my
father
and
instantly
agreed
to
receive
me
he
then
pulled
out
a
purse
and
offering
it
to
my
father
said
common
price
of
a
recruit
is
now
five
guineas
but
so
well
am
i
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
your
son
and
the
confidence
you
repose
in
me
that
i
must
insist
upon
your
accepting
what
is
contained
in
this
purse
you
will
dispose
of
it
as
you
please
for
your
mutual
advantage
before
i
depart
i
will
give
such
directions
as
may
enable
him
to
join
the
regiment
which
is
now
preparing
to
march
he
then
requested
that
he
might
retire
to
rest
and
my
father
would
have
resigned
the
only
bed
he
had
in
the
house
to
his
guest
but
he
absolutely
refused
and
said
you
shame
me
in
the
eyes
of
my
new
recruit
what
is
a
soldier
good
for
that
can
not
sleep
without
a
bed
the
time
will
soon
arrive
when
i
shall
think
a
comfortable
roof
and
a
little
straw
an
enviable
luxury
i
therefore
raised
him
as
convenient
a
couch
as
i
was
able
to
make
with
heath
and
straw
and
wrapping
himself
up
in
his
he
threw
himself
down
upon
it
and
slept
till
morning
with
the
first
dawn
of
day
he
rose
and
departed
having
first
given
me
the
directions
which
were
necessary
to
enable
me
to
join
the
regiment
but
before
he
went
my
father
who
was
equally
charmed
with
his
generosity
and
manners
pressed
him
to
take
back
part
of
the
money
he
had
given
us
this
however
he
absolutely
refused
and
left
us
full
of
esteem
and
admiration
i
will
not
gentlemen
repeat
the
affecting
scene
i
had
to
undergo
in
taking
leave
of
my
family
and
friends
it
pierced
me
to
the
very
heart
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
almost
repented
of
being
so
near
the
accomplishment
of
my
wishes
i
was
however
engaged
and
determined
to
fulfil
my
engagement
i
therefore
tore
myself
from
my
family
having
with
difficulty
prevailed
upon
my
father
to
accept
of
part
of
the
money
i
had
received
for
my
enrolment
i
will
not
trespass
upon
your
time
to
describe
the
various
emotions
which
i
felt
from
the
crowd
of
new
sensations
that
entered
my
mind
during
our
march
i
arrived
without
any
accident
in
london
the
splendid
capital
of
this
kingdom
but
i
could
not
there
restrain
my
astonishment
to
see
an
immense
people
talking
of
wounds
of
death
of
battles
sieges
and
conquests
in
the
midst
of
feasts
and
balls
and
and
calmly
devoting
thousands
of
their
to
perish
by
famine
or
the
sword
while
they
considered
the
loss
of
a
dinner
or
the
endurance
of
a
shower
as
an
exertion
too
great
for
human
fortitude
i
soon
embarked
and
arrived
without
any
other
accident
than
a
horrible
sickness
at
the
place
of
our
destination
in
america
here
i
joined
my
gallant
officer
colonel
simmons
who
had
performed
the
voyage
in
another
ship
miss
simmons
who
was
present
at
this
narration
seemed
to
be
much
interested
at
this
mention
of
her
own
name
she
however
did
not
express
her
feelings
and
the
stranger
proceeded
with
his
story
the
gentleman
was
with
justice
the
most
beloved
and
the
most
deserving
to
be
so
of
any
officer
i
have
ever
known
inflexible
in
everything
that
concerned
the
honour
of
the
service
he
never
pardoned
wilful
misbehaviour
because
he
knew
that
it
was
incompatible
with
military
discipline
yet
when
obliged
to
punish
he
did
it
with
such
reluctance
that
he
seemed
to
suffer
almost
as
much
as
the
criminal
himself
but
if
his
reason
imposed
this
just
and
necessary
severity
his
heart
had
taught
him
another
lesson
in
respect
to
private
distresses
of
his
men
he
visited
them
in
their
sickness
relieved
their
miseries
and
was
a
niggard
of
nothing
but
human
blood
but
i
ought
to
correct
myself
in
that
expression
for
he
was
rashly
lavish
of
his
own
and
to
that
we
owe
his
untimely
loss
i
had
not
been
long
in
america
before
the
colonel
who
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
language
and
manners
of
the
savage
tribes
that
border
upon
the
british
colonies
was
sent
on
an
embassy
to
one
of
their
nations
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
their
alliance
with
britain
it
may
not
perhaps
be
uninteresting
to
you
gentlemen
and
to
this
my
honourable
little
master
to
hear
some
account
of
a
people
whose
manners
and
customs
are
so
much
the
reverse
of
what
you
see
at
home
as
my
worthy
officer
therefore
contented
with
my
assiduity
and
improvement
in
military
knowledge
permitted
me
to
have
the
honour
of
attending
him
i
will
describe
some
of
the
most
curious
facts
which
i
was
witness
to
you
have
doubtless
heard
many
accounts
of
the
surprising
increase
of
the
english
colonies
in
america
and
when
we
reflect
that
it
is
scarcely
a
hundred
years
since
some
of
them
were
established
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
have
made
rapid
improvements
in
clearing
the
ground
of
woods
and
bringing
it
to
cultivation
yet
much
as
they
have
already
done
the
country
is
yet
an
immense
forest
except
immediately
on
the
coasts
the
forests
extend
on
every
side
to
a
distance
that
no
human
sagacity
or
observation
has
been
able
to
determine
they
abound
in
every
species
of
tree
which
you
see
in
england
to
which
may
be
added
a
great
variety
more
which
are
unknown
with
us
under
their
shade
is
generally
found
a
rich
luxurious
herbage
which
serves
for
pasture
to
a
thousand
herds
of
animals
here
are
seen
elks
a
kind
of
deer
of
the
largest
size
and
buffaloes
a
species
of
wild
ox
by
thousands
and
even
horses
which
having
been
originally
brought
over
by
the
spaniards
have
escaped
from
their
settlements
and
multiplied
in
the
woods
dear
said
tommy
that
must
be
a
fine
country
indeed
where
horses
run
wild
why
a
man
might
have
one
for
nothing
and
yet
said
mr
merton
it
would
be
but
of
little
use
for
a
person
to
have
a
wild
horse
who
is
not
able
to
manage
a
tame
one
tommy
made
no
answer
to
his
father
and
the
man
proceeded
but
the
greatest
curiosity
of
all
this
country
is
in
my
opinion
the
various
tribes
or
nations
which
inhabit
it
bred
up
from
their
infancy
to
a
life
of
equal
hardiness
with
the
wild
animals
they
are
almost
as
robust
in
their
constitutions
these
various
tribes
inhabit
little
villages
which
generally
are
seated
upon
the
banks
of
rivers
and
though
they
cultivate
small
portions
of
land
around
their
towns
they
seek
the
greater
part
of
their
subsistence
from
the
chase
in
their
persons
they
are
rather
tall
and
slender
but
admirably
and
active
and
their
colour
is
a
pale
red
exactly
resembling
copper
thus
accustomed
to
roam
about
the
woods
and
brave
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
as
well
as
continually
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
their
enemies
they
acquire
a
degree
of
courage
and
fortitude
which
can
scarcely
be
conceived
it
is
nothing
to
them
to
pass
whole
days
without
food
to
be
whole
nights
upon
the
bare
damp
ground
and
to
swim
the
widest
rivers
in
the
depth
of
winter
money
indeed
and
the
greatest
part
of
what
we
call
the
conveniences
of
life
they
are
unacquainted
with
nor
can
they
conceive
that
one
man
should
serve
another
merely
because
he
has
a
few
pieces
of
shining
metal
they
imagine
that
the
only
distinctions
arise
from
superior
courage
and
bodily
perfections
and
therefore
these
alone
are
able
to
engage
their
esteem
a
celebrated
traveller
relates
that
on
one
occasion
while
he
was
engaged
in
finishing
a
drawing
he
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
three
of
these
persons
entering
the
room
in
which
he
was
at
first
he
feared
that
they
intended
to
attack
him
but
he
soon
found
that
he
was
mistaken
for
upon
their
seeing
the
representation
of
themselves
upon
a
sheet
which
he
had
taken
the
day
before
and
which
one
of
them
took
up
they
immediately
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
while
one
of
them
offered
to
purchase
it
by
giving
some
fruit
in
exchange
but
if
their
manners
are
gentle
in
peace
they
are
more
dreadful
when
provoked
than
all
the
wildest
animals
of
the
forest
bred
up
from
infancy
to
suffer
no
restraint
and
to
give
an
unbounded
loose
to
the
indulgence
of
their
passions
they
know
not
what
it
is
to
forgive
those
who
have
injured
them
they
love
their
tribe
with
a
degree
of
affection
that
is
totally
unknown
in
every
other
country
for
they
are
ready
to
suffer
every
hardship
and
danger
in
its
defence
they
scruple
not
in
the
least
to
experience
wounds
and
pain
and
even
death
itself
as
often
as
the
interest
of
the
country
to
which
they
are
so
much
attached
is
concerned
but
the
same
attachment
renders
them
implacable
and
unforgiving
to
all
their
enemies
in
short
they
seem
to
have
all
the
virtues
and
the
vices
of
the
ancient
spartans
to
one
of
these
tribes
called
the
ottigamies
was
colonel
simmons
sent
ambassador
accompanied
by
a
few
more
officers
and
some
private
men
among
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
be
included
we
pursued
our
march
for
several
days
through
forests
which
seemed
to
be
of
equal
duration
with
the
world
itself
sometimes
we
were
shrouded
in
such
obscurity
from
the
thickness
of
the
covert
that
we
could
scarcely
see
the
light
of
heaven
sometimes
we
emerged
into
spacious
meadows
bare
of
trees
and
covered
with
the
most
luxuriant
herbage
on
which
were
feeding
immense
herds
of
buffaloes
these
as
soon
as
they
snuffed
the
approach
of
men
which
they
are
capable
of
doing
even
at
a
considerable
distance
ran
with
precipitation
into
the
surrounding
woods
many
however
fell
beneath
our
attack
and
served
us
for
food
during
our
journey
at
length
we
came
to
a
wide
and
rapid
river
upon
whose
banks
we
found
a
party
of
friendly
savages
with
some
of
whom
we
embarked
upon
canoes
made
of
the
bark
of
trees
to
proceed
to
the
country
of
the
ottigamies
after
three
days
incessant
rowing
we
entered
a
spacious
lake
upon
whose
banks
were
encamped
a
considerable
portion
of
the
nation
we
sought
as
we
approached
the
shore
they
saluted
us
with
a
volley
of
balls
from
their
muskets
which
whistled
just
above
our
heads
without
producing
mischief
i
and
several
of
the
soldiers
instantly
seized
our
arms
imagining
it
to
be
a
hostile
attack
but
our
leader
quieted
our
apprehensions
by
informing
us
that
this
was
only
a
friendly
salute
with
which
a
nation
of
warriors
received
and
welcomed
their
allies
we
landed
and
were
instantly
conducted
to
the
assembly
of
the
chiefs
who
were
sitting
upon
the
ground
without
external
pomp
or
ceremony
with
their
arms
beside
them
but
there
was
in
their
countenances
and
eyes
an
expression
of
ferocious
grandeur
which
would
have
daunted
the
boldest
european
yes
gentlemen
i
have
seen
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
men
in
my
own
country
i
have
seen
them
adorned
with
every
external
circumstance
of
dress
of
pomp
and
equipage
to
inspire
respect
but
never
did
i
see
anything
which
so
completely
awed
the
soul
as
the
angry
scowl
and
fiery
glance
of
a
savage
american
as
soon
as
our
leader
entered
the
circle
he
produced
the
calumet
or
pipe
of
peace
this
is
the
universal
mark
of
friendship
and
alliance
among
all
the
barbarous
nations
of
america
and
he
that
bears
it
is
considered
with
so
much
respect
that
his
person
is
always
safe
this
calumet
is
nothing
but
a
long
and
slender
pipe
ornamented
with
the
most
lively
and
beautiful
feathers
which
are
ingeniously
fixed
along
the
tube
the
bowl
is
composed
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
reddish
marble
and
filled
with
scented
herbs
and
tobacco
colonel
simmons
lighted
his
pipe
with
great
solemnity
and
turning
the
bowl
first
towards
the
heavens
then
to
the
earth
then
in
a
circle
round
him
he
began
to
smoke
in
the
mean
time
the
whole
assembly
sat
with
mute
attention
waiting
to
hear
his
proposals
for
though
we
call
them
savages
yet
in
some
respects
they
well
deserve
to
be
imitated
by
more
refined
nations
in
all
their
meetings
and
assemblies
the
greatest
order
and
regularity
prevail
whoever
rises
to
speak
is
sure
of
being
patiently
heard
to
the
end
without
the
least
interruption
our
leader
then
began
to
harangue
them
in
their
own
language
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
i
did
not
understand
what
passed
but
it
was
afterwards
explained
to
me
that
he
set
before
their
eyes
the
injuries
they
had
mutually
received
from
the
french
and
the
tribes
in
their
alliance
he
told
them
that
their
great
father
for
so
these
people
call
the
king
of
britain
had
taken
up
the
hatchet
of
war
and
was
sending
an
innumerable
band
of
warriors
to
punish
the
insults
of
his
enemies
he
told
them
that
he
had
ordered
him
to
visit
the
ottigamies
his
dutiful
children
and
smoke
with
them
the
pipe
of
peace
he
invited
their
young
men
to
join
the
warriors
that
came
from
beyond
the
ocean
and
who
were
marching
to
bury
the
bones
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
killed
by
their
mutual
foes
when
he
had
concluded
he
flung
upon
the
ground
a
curious
string
of
shells
which
is
called
the
belt
of
this
is
a
necessary
circumstance
in
all
the
treaties
made
with
these
tribes
whoever
comes
as
an
ambassador
brings
one
with
him
to
present
to
the
people
whose
friendship
is
solicited
and
if
the
belt
is
accepted
the
proposed
alliance
is
considered
as
entered
into
as
soon
as
our
leader
had
finished
a
chief
of
a
stature
superior
to
the
common
race
of
men
and
of
a
most
determined
look
jumped
into
the
middle
of
the
assembly
and
taking
up
the
belt
cried
out
in
their
language
us
march
my
brethren
with
the
young
men
of
our
great
father
let
us
dig
up
the
hatchet
of
war
and
revenge
the
bones
of
our
countrymen
they
lie
unburied
and
cry
to
us
for
vengeance
we
will
not
be
deaf
to
their
cries
we
will
shake
off
all
delays
we
will
approve
ourselves
worthy
of
our
ancestors
we
will
drink
the
blood
of
our
enemies
and
spread
a
feast
of
carnage
for
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
this
resolution
was
universally
approved
by
the
whole
nation
who
consented
to
the
war
with
a
ferocious
joy
the
assembly
was
then
dissolved
and
the
chiefs
prepared
for
their
intended
march
according
to
the
manners
of
their
country
all
the
savage
tribes
that
inhabit
america
are
accustomed
to
very
little
clothing
inured
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
and
being
in
the
constant
exercise
of
all
their
limbs
they
can
not
bear
the
restraint
and
confinement
of
a
european
dress
the
greater
part
of
their
bodies
therefore
is
naked
and
this
they
paint
in
various
fashions
to
give
additional
terror
to
their
looks
when
the
chiefs
were
thus
prepared
they
came
from
their
tents
and
the
last
solemnity
i
was
witness
to
was
dancing
the
dance
of
war
and
singing
the
song
of
death
but
what
words
can
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
furious
movements
and
expressions
which
animated
them
through
the
whole
of
this
performance
every
man
was
armed
with
a
kind
of
hatchet
which
is
their
usual
weapon
in
battle
and
called
a
this
he
held
in
his
hand
and
brandished
through
the
whole
of
the
dreadful
spectacle
as
they
went
on
their
faces
kindled
into
an
expression
of
anger
that
would
daunt
the
boldest
spectator
their
gestures
seemed
to
be
inspired
by
frantic
rage
and
animosity
they
moved
their
bodies
with
the
most
violent
agitations
and
it
was
easy
to
see
they
represented
all
the
circumstances
of
a
real
combat
they
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
close
or
distant
battle
and
brandished
their
weapons
with
so
much
fury
that
you
would
have
imagined
they
were
going
every
instant
to
hew
each
other
to
pieces
nor
would
it
have
been
possible
even
for
the
performers
themselves
of
this
terrific
dance
to
have
avoided
mutual
wounds
and
slaughter
had
they
not
been
endued
with
that
extraordinary
activity
which
is
peculiar
to
savage
nations
by
intervals
they
increased
the
horrid
solemnity
of
the
exhibition
by
uttering
yells
that
would
have
pierced
a
european
ear
with
horror
i
have
seen
rage
and
fury
under
various
forms
and
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
but
i
must
confess
that
everything
i
have
seen
elsewhere
is
feeble
and
contemptible
when
compared
with
this
day
spectacle
when
the
whole
was
finished
they
entertained
us
at
a
public
festival
in
their
cabins
and
when
we
departed
dismissed
us
with
these
expressive
wishes
they
prayed
that
the
great
spirit
would
favour
us
with
a
prosperous
voyage
that
he
would
give
us
an
unclouded
sky
and
smooth
waters
by
day
and
that
we
might
lie
down
at
night
on
a
beaver
blanket
enjoying
uninterrupted
sleep
and
pleasant
dreams
and
that
we
might
find
continual
protection
under
the
great
pipe
of
peace
i
have
been
thus
particular
said
the
highlander
in
describing
the
circumstances
of
this
embassy
because
you
have
not
disdained
to
hear
the
story
of
my
adventures
and
i
thought
that
this
description
of
a
people
so
totally
unlike
all
you
have
been
accustomed
to
in
europe
might
not
prove
entirely
uninteresting
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
said
mr
barlow
for
all
these
curious
particulars
which
are
perfectly
conformable
to
all
i
have
heard
and
read
upon
the
subject
nor
can
i
consider
without
a
certain
degree
of
admiration
the
savage
grandeur
of
man
in
his
most
simple
state
the
passion
for
revenge
which
marks
the
character
of
all
uncivilised
nations
is
certainly
to
be
condemned
but
it
is
one
of
the
constant
prejudices
of
their
education
and
many
of
those
that
call
themselves
refined
have
more
to
blush
at
in
that
respect
than
they
are
aware
of
few
i
am
afraid
even
in
the
most
refined
state
of
society
have
arrived
at
that
sublime
generosity
which
is
able
to
forgive
the
injuries
of
his
when
it
has
the
power
to
repay
them
and
i
see
many
around
me
that
are
disgraced
by
the
vices
of
uncivilised
americans
without
a
claim
to
their
virtues
i
will
not
fatigue
your
ears
continued
the
highlander
with
the
recital
of
all
the
events
i
was
engaged
in
during
the
progress
of
the
war
the
description
of
blood
and
carnage
is
always
disagreeable
to
a
humane
mind
and
though
the
perversity
of
mankind
may
sometimes
render
war
a
necessary
evil
the
remembrance
of
its
mischiefs
is
always
painful
i
will
only
mention
one
event
continually
lamented
in
the
annals
of
this
country
because
it
is
connected
with
the
untimely
fate
of
my
noble
friend
and
gallant
leader
it
was
determined
by
those
who
governed
that
we
should
march
through
the
woods
upon
a
distant
expedition
against
the
french
the
conduct
of
this
enterprise
was
given
to
a
brave
but
rash
commander
totally
unacquainted
with
the
people
he
had
to
oppose
and
unskilled
in
the
nature
of
a
savage
war
we
therefore
began
our
march
through
the
same
trackless
wilds
i
have
described
and
proceeded
for
several
days
without
any
other
difficulties
than
the
nature
of
the
country
itself
produced
and
without
seeing
the
face
of
an
enemy
it
was
in
vain
that
officers
of
the
greatest
experience
and
particularly
my
worthy
colonel
suggested
to
our
commander
the
necessity
of
using
every
precaution
against
a
dangerous
and
insidious
foe
war
is
not
managed
amid
the
forests
of
america
in
the
same
manner
as
it
is
conducted
upon
the
plains
of
europe
the
temper
of
the
people
there
conspires
with
the
nature
of
the
country
to
render
it
a
continual
scene
of
stratagems
and
surprise
unencumbered
with
tents
or
baggage
or
numerous
trains
of
artillery
the
hostile
warriors
set
out
in
small
and
chosen
parties
with
nothing
but
their
arms
and
are
continually
upon
the
watch
to
deceive
their
enemies
long
experience
has
taught
them
a
degree
of
sagacity
in
traversing
the
woods
which
to
us
is
inconceivable
neither
the
widest
rivers
nor
the
most
extensive
forests
can
retard
them
for
an
instant
a
march
of
a
thousand
miles
is
scarcely
to
them
a
greater
difficulty
than
the
passage
of
a
european
army
between
two
neighbouring
towns
the
woods
themselves
afford
them
a
continual
supply
of
provisions
in
the
various
animals
which
they
kill
by
the
chase
when
they
are
near
their
enemies
they
frequently
lurk
all
day
in
thickets
for
fear
of
a
discovery
and
pursue
their
march
by
night
hundreds
of
them
sometimes
pursue
their
course
in
the
same
line
treading
only
in
each
other
steps
and
the
last
of
the
party
carefully
covers
over
the
impressions
which
his
fellows
have
made
when
they
are
thus
upon
the
point
of
accomplishing
their
purpose
the
very
necessities
of
nature
are
unheeded
they
cease
to
fire
upon
the
beasts
of
the
forest
lest
it
should
alarm
the
foe
they
feed
upon
the
roots
or
the
bark
of
trees
or
pass
successive
days
in
a
perfect
abstinence
from
food
all
this
our
colonel
represented
to
the
general
and
conjured
him
with
the
strongest
entreaties
not
to
hazard
the
safety
of
our
army
by
an
incautious
progress
he
advised
him
to
send
out
numerous
detachments
to
beat
the
bushes
and
examine
the
woods
and
offered
himself
to
secure
the
march
of
the
army
but
presumption
is
always
blind
our
general
was
unacquainted
with
any
other
than
european
warfare
and
could
not
conceive
that
naked
savages
would
dare
to
attack
an
army
of
two
thousand
disciplined
troops
one
morning
the
way
before
us
appeared
more
intricate
and
obscure
than
common
the
forests
did
not
as
usual
consist
of
lofty
trees
which
afford
a
tolerably
clear
prospect
between
their
trunks
but
were
composed
of
creeping
bushes
and
impervious
thickets
the
army
marched
as
usual
with
the
vain
ostentation
of
military
discipline
but
totally
unprepared
for
the
dreadful
scene
which
followed
at
length
we
entered
a
gloomy
valley
surrounded
on
every
side
by
the
thickest
shade
and
rendered
swampy
by
the
overflowings
of
a
little
rivulet
in
this
situation
it
was
impossible
to
continue
our
march
without
disordering
our
ranks
and
part
of
the
army
extended
itself
beyond
the
rest
while
another
part
of
the
line
involuntarily
fell
behind
in
the
moment
while
the
officers
were
employed
in
rectifying
the
disorder
of
their
men
a
sudden
noise
of
musketry
was
heard
in
front
which
stretched
about
twenty
of
our
men
upon
the
field
the
soldiers
instinctively
fired
towards
the
part
whence
they
were
attacked
and
instantly
fell
back
in
disorder
but
it
was
equally
vain
to
retreat
or
go
forward
for
it
now
appeared
that
we
were
completely
hemmed
in
on
every
side
resounded
the
fatal
peals
of
scattering
fire
that
thinned
our
ranks
and
extended
our
bravest
comrades
on
the
earth
figure
to
yourself
a
shoal
of
fishes
enclosed
within
the
net
that
circle
in
vain
the
fatal
labyrinth
in
which
they
are
involved
or
rather
conceive
what
i
have
myself
been
witness
to
a
herd
of
deer
surrounded
on
every
side
by
a
band
of
active
and
unpitying
hunters
who
press
and
gall
them
on
every
side
and
exterminate
them
at
leisure
in
their
flight
just
such
was
the
situation
of
our
unfortunate
countrymen
after
a
few
unavailing
discharges
which
never
annoyed
a
secret
enemy
that
scattered
death
unseen
the
ranks
were
broken
and
all
subordination
lost
the
ground
was
covered
with
gasping
wretches
and
stained
with
blood
the
woods
resounded
with
cries
and
groans
and
fruitless
attempts
of
our
gallant
officers
to
rally
their
men
and
check
the
progress
of
the
enemy
by
intervals
was
heard
more
shrill
more
dreadful
than
all
the
rest
the
dismal
yell
of
the
victorious
savages
who
now
emboldened
by
their
success
began
to
leave
the
covert
and
hew
down
those
who
fled
with
unrelenting
cruelty
as
to
myself
the
description
which
our
colonel
had
given
me
of
their
method
of
attack
and
the
precautions
to
be
used
against
it
rendered
me
perhaps
less
disturbed
than
i
should
otherwise
have
been
i
remarked
that
those
who
stood
and
those
who
fled
were
exposed
to
equal
danger
those
who
kept
their
ranks
and
endeavoured
to
repel
the
enemy
exposed
their
persons
to
their
fire
and
were
successively
shot
down
as
happened
to
most
of
our
unfortunate
officers
while
those
who
fled
frequently
rushed
headlong
upon
the
very
death
they
sought
to
avoid
pierced
to
the
heart
at
the
sight
of
such
a
carnage
of
my
gallant
comrades
i
grew
indifferent
to
life
and
abandoned
myself
to
despair
but
it
was
a
despair
that
neither
impaired
my
exertions
nor
robbed
me
of
the
faculties
of
my
mind
me
i
cried
gallant
countrymen
and
we
shall
yet
be
safe
i
then
directly
ran
to
the
nearest
tree
and
sheltered
myself
behind
its
stem
convinced
that
this
precaution
alone
could
secure
me
from
the
incessant
volleys
which
darted
on
every
side
a
small
number
of
highlanders
followed
my
example
and
thus
secured
we
began
to
fire
with
more
success
at
the
enemy
who
now
exposed
themselves
with
less
reserve
this
check
seemed
to
astonish
and
confound
them
and
had
not
the
panic
been
so
general
it
is
possible
that
this
successful
effort
might
have
changed
the
fortune
of
the
fight
for
in
another
quarter
the
provincial
troops
that
accompanied
us
behaved
with
the
greatest
bravery
and
though
deserted
by
the
european
forces
effected
their
own
retreat
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
hope
for
victory
or
even
safety
the
ranks
were
broken
on
every
side
the
greater
part
of
our
officers
slain
or
wounded
and
our
unfortunate
general
himself
had
expiated
with
his
life
his
fatal
rashness
i
cast
my
eyes
around
and
saw
nothing
but
images
of
death
and
horror
and
frantic
rage
yet
even
then
the
safety
of
my
noble
colonel
was
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
i
sought
him
for
some
time
in
vain
amid
the
various
scenes
of
carnage
which
surrounded
me
at
length
i
discovered
him
at
a
distance
almost
deserted
by
his
men
yet
still
attempting
to
renew
the
fight
and
heedless
of
the
wounds
which
covered
him
transported
with
grief
and
passion
i
immediately
darted
forward
to
offer
him
my
feeble
support
but
in
the
very
instant
of
my
arrival
he
received
a
straggling
ball
in
his
bosom
and
tottering
to
a
tree
supported
his
fainting
limbs
against
the
trunk
just
in
that
moment
three
of
our
savage
enemies
observed
his
situation
and
marked
him
for
their
prey
they
raised
their
hideous
yell
and
darted
upon
him
with
the
speed
and
fierceness
of
wolves
fury
then
took
possession
of
my
soul
had
i
possessed
a
thousand
lives
i
should
have
held
them
cheap
in
the
balance
i
fired
with
so
unerring
an
aim
that
i
stretched
the
foremost
on
the
earth
the
second
received
the
point
of
my
bayonet
in
his
breast
and
fell
in
the
pangs
of
death
the
third
daunted
with
the
fate
of
his
companions
turned
his
steps
another
way
just
then
a
horse
that
had
lost
his
rider
was
galloping
along
the
wood
i
bounded
across
the
path
and
seizing
him
by
the
bridle
instantly
led
him
to
my
leader
and
conjured
him
to
preserve
his
glorious
life
he
thanked
me
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
for
my
friendship
but
bade
me
preserve
my
own
life
to
myself
said
he
do
not
wish
to
survive
my
country
dishonour
and
even
had
i
such
a
wish
the
wounds
i
have
received
would
render
all
escape
impossible
that
is
your
resolution
said
i
will
die
together
for
i
swear
by
the
eternal
majesty
of
my
creator
that
i
will
not
leave
you
when
he
saw
me
thus
resolved
he
consented
to
use
my
assistance
and
with
infinite
difficulty
i
seated
him
upon
the
horse
which
holding
by
the
reins
as
i
was
then
light
and
active
i
guided
along
the
wood
with
no
inconsiderable
speed
fortunately
for
me
we
were
not
observed
by
any
of
our
savage
enemies
so
that
flying
through
the
thickest
part
of
the
forest
we
left
the
danger
behind
and
were
soon
removed
beyond
the
sight
or
hearing
of
the
battle
said
i
noble
leader
you
are
now
almost
in
safety
and
i
trust
you
will
yet
preserve
a
life
so
necessary
to
your
friends
and
country
he
answered
me
with
the
kindest
expressions
but
with
a
feeble
voice
i
have
consented
to
fly
more
for
the
sake
of
preserving
your
life
than
from
any
hopes
of
my
own
but
since
we
are
at
a
distance
from
yonder
dreadful
scene
permit
me
to
alight
i
have
consumed
my
small
remaining
forces
in
the
way
and
now
i
am
faint
from
loss
of
blood
he
sunk
down
at
this
and
would
have
fallen
but
i
received
him
in
my
arms
i
bore
him
to
the
next
thicket
and
strewing
grass
and
leaves
upon
the
ground
endeavoured
to
prepare
him
a
bed
he
thanked
me
again
with
gratitude
and
tenderness
and
grasped
my
hand
as
he
lay
in
the
very
agonies
of
death
for
such
it
was
although
i
believed
he
had
only
fainted
and
long
tried
every
ineffectual
method
to
restore
departed
life
thus
was
i
deprived
of
the
noblest
officer
and
kindest
friend
that
ever
deserved
the
attachment
of
a
soldier
twenty
years
have
now
rolled
over
me
since
that
inauspicious
day
yet
it
lives
for
ever
in
my
remembrance
and
never
shall
be
blotted
from
my
soul
the
highlander
then
turned
away
to
hide
a
tear
which
did
not
misbecome
his
manly
countenance
the
company
seemed
all
to
share
his
griefs
but
miss
simmons
above
the
rest
however
as
the
natural
gentleness
of
her
temper
was
sufficiently
known
no
one
suspected
that
she
had
any
particular
interest
in
the
relation
i
sat
till
night
continued
the
stranger
supporting
the
breathless
body
of
my
colonel
and
vainly
hoping
he
might
return
to
life
at
length
i
perceived
that
his
noble
soul
was
fled
for
ever
my
own
wounds
grew
stiff
and
painful
and
exhausted
nature
required
a
supply
of
food
i
therefore
arose
and
finding
a
spring
that
trickled
down
a
hill
at
no
great
distance
i
refreshed
myself
by
a
copious
draught
and
washed
the
clotted
blood
away
from
the
hurts
i
had
received
i
then
crushed
some
leaves
which
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
imagine
salutary
and
bound
them
on
with
bandages
which
i
tore
from
my
linen
i
also
found
a
few
wild
fruits
which
past
experience
had
taught
me
were
innocent
and
with
them
i
allayed
the
pains
of
hunger
i
then
returned
to
the
thicket
and
creeping
into
the
thickest
part
endeavoured
to
compose
myself
to
rest
strange
gentlemen
as
it
may
appear
neither
the
forlorn
nature
of
my
situation
nor
the
dangers
with
which
i
was
beset
were
sufficient
to
keep
me
awake
my
wearied
and
exhausted
body
seemed
to
triumph
over
all
the
agitations
of
my
mind
and
i
sunk
into
a
sleep
as
deep
and
profound
as
that
of
death
itself
i
awoke
next
morning
with
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
but
more
composed
i
better
understood
the
difficulties
in
which
i
was
involved
and
the
uncertainty
of
my
escape
i
was
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
desert
totally
destitute
of
human
assistance
or
support
should
i
meet
with
any
of
my
i
could
expect
nothing
but
implacable
cruelty
and
even
if
i
escaped
their
vigilance
what
method
of
finding
subsistence
or
of
measuring
back
without
a
guide
the
long
and
tedious
march
i
had
trodden
hope
however
and
the
vigour
of
my
constitution
still
supported
me
i
reflected
that
it
is
the
common
lot
of
man
to
struggle
with
misfortunes
that
it
is
cowardice
to
yield
to
evils
when
present
the
representation
of
which
had
not
deterred
me
from
voluntarily
embracing
the
profession
of
a
soldier
and
that
the
providence
of
heaven
was
as
capable
of
protecting
me
in
the
forests
of
america
as
upon
my
native
mountains
i
therefore
determined
to
struggle
till
the
last
with
the
difficulties
which
surrounded
me
and
to
meet
my
fortune
like
a
man
yet
as
i
still
by
intervals
heard
the
dismal
cries
of
the
enemy
and
saw
their
fires
at
a
distance
i
lay
close
till
night
in
the
obscurity
of
my
thicket
when
all
was
dark
and
still
i
ventured
abroad
and
laid
in
my
scanty
provisions
of
fruits
and
herbs
and
drank
again
at
the
spring
the
pain
of
my
wounds
now
began
to
abate
a
little
though
i
suffered
extremely
from
the
cold
as
i
did
not
dare
to
kindle
a
fire
from
the
fear
of
discovering
myself
by
its
light
three
nights
and
days
did
i
lead
this
solitary
life
in
continual
dread
of
the
savage
parties
which
scoured
all
the
woods
in
pursuit
of
stragglers
and
often
passed
so
near
my
place
of
retreat
that
i
gave
myself
over
for
lost
at
length
on
the
fourth
evening
fancying
myself
a
little
restored
and
that
the
activity
of
the
enemy
might
be
abated
i
ventured
out
and
pursued
my
march
i
scarcely
need
describe
the
various
difficulties
and
dangers
to
which
i
was
exposed
in
such
a
journey
however
i
still
had
with
me
my
musket
and
as
my
ammunition
was
not
quite
exhausted
i
depended
upon
the
woods
themselves
to
supply
me
with
food
i
travelled
the
greater
part
of
the
night
involving
myself
still
deeper
in
these
inextricable
forests
for
i
was
afraid
to
pursue
the
direction
of
our
former
march
as
i
imagined
the
savages
were
dispersed
along
the
country
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
i
therefore
took
a
direction
as
nearly
as
i
could
judge
parallel
to
the
english
settlements
and
inclining
to
the
south
in
this
manner
i
forced
my
way
along
the
woods
all
night
and
with
the
morning
had
reason
to
think
that
i
had
advanced
a
considerable
distance
my
wounds
began
now
to
pain
me
afresh
with
this
exertion
and
compelled
me
to
allow
myself
some
repose
i
chose
out
the
thickest
covert
i
could
find
and
shrouding
myself
as
well
as
i
was
able
was
soon
overpowered
by
sleep
i
did
not
awake
till
the
sun
had
gained
the
meridian
and
creeping
from
my
retreat
beheld
with
some
degree
of
terror
an
enormous
rattlesnake
that
was
coiled
up
full
in
my
way
and
seemed
determined
to
oppose
my
passage
this
animal
is
frequent
in
the
southern
colonies
and
is
the
most
poisonous
of
all
the
reptiles
that
haunt
the
woods
he
is
in
length
from
two
to
six
feet
beautifully
variegated
with
different
colours
but
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
attending
him
is
a
natural
noise
that
he
produces
with
every
motion
of
his
tail
and
which
too
occasions
his
name
i
soon
destroyed
my
hissing
foe
and
taking
courage
for
the
first
time
to
kindle
a
fire
i
roasted
him
upon
the
embers
and
made
the
most
delicious
meal
i
ever
remember
upon
his
flesh
what
exclaimed
tommy
is
it
possible
to
eat
snakes
i
thought
they
had
been
all
over
poison
master
replied
the
highlander
the
want
of
food
will
reconcile
us
to
many
meats
which
we
should
scarcely
think
eatable
nothing
has
surprised
me
more
than
to
see
the
poor
in
various
countries
complaining
of
the
scarcity
of
food
yet
throwing
away
every
year
thousands
of
the
carcases
of
horses
which
are
full
as
wholesome
and
nourishing
as
beef
and
are
in
many
countries
preferred
to
it
but
in
general
every
animal
may
be
eaten
and
affords
a
salutary
food
as
to
snakes
the
poison
of
them
is
contained
in
the
hollow
of
their
teeth
when
they
bite
they
instil
their
venom
into
the
wound
which
mixes
with
the
blood
and
without
a
timely
remedy
destroys
the
sufferer
but
if
you
cut
off
the
head
the
rest
of
the
body
is
not
only
wholesome
but
palatable
and
i
have
known
it
eaten
as
a
delicacy
by
many
inhabitants
of
the
colonies
thus
refreshed
therefore
i
pursued
my
march
through
the
same
thick
gloomy
country
without
meeting
the
least
appearance
of
a
human
creature
and
at
night
i
cut
with
a
hatchet
that
i
had
about
me
some
boughs
with
which
i
erected
a
temporary
shelter
the
next
day
as
i
was
pursuing
my
march
i
saw
a
deer
bound
by
me
upon
whose
shoulders
was
fixed
a
fierce
and
destructive
animal
resembling
a
tiger
this
creature
which
is
about
the
size
of
a
moderate
dog
ascends
the
trees
and
hides
himself
among
the
branches
till
a
deer
or
any
other
animal
that
he
can
master
passes
within
his
reach
he
then
darts
himself
with
a
sudden
spring
full
upon
the
neck
or
shoulder
of
the
unfortunate
animal
which
he
continues
tearing
with
so
much
violence
that
he
soon
despatches
him
this
was
actually
the
case
with
the
poor
deer
that
passed
me
for
he
had
not
run
a
hundred
yards
before
he
fell
down
in
the
agonies
of
death
and
his
destroyer
began
to
regale
himself
upon
the
prey
i
instantly
saw
that
this
was
a
lucky
opportunity
of
supplying
myself
with
food
for
several
days
i
therefore
ran
towards
the
animal
and
by
a
violent
shout
made
him
abandon
his
victim
and
retire
growling
into
the
woods
i
then
kindled
a
fire
with
leaves
and
sticks
and
cutting
off
a
large
slice
of
venison
i
plentifully
refreshed
myself
for
my
journey
i
then
packed
up
as
much
of
the
most
fleshy
parts
of
the
body
as
i
could
conveniently
carry
and
abandoned
the
rest
to
wild
beasts
in
this
manner
did
i
march
for
several
days
without
wanting
food
or
seeing
any
probable
end
of
my
fatigues
at
length
i
found
a
lofty
mountain
before
me
which
i
determined
to
ascend
imagining
that
such
an
elevation
might
enable
me
to
make
some
useful
discoveries
in
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
country
i
had
to
traverse
and
perhaps
present
me
with
some
appearances
of
cultivation
or
inhabitants
i
therefore
ascended
with
infinite
fatigue
a
rough
and
stony
ascent
of
several
miles
in
which
i
was
frequently
obliged
to
clamber
up
pointed
rocks
and
work
my
way
along
the
edge
of
dangerous
precipices
i
however
arrived
without
any
accident
at
the
top
which
was
entirely
bare
of
trees
and
looking
round
me
i
beheld
a
wild
and
desert
country
extending
to
a
prodigious
distance
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
i
discovered
nothing
but
forests
on
every
side
but
one
there
the
country
seemed
to
be
more
open
though
equally
uncultivated
and
i
saw
meadows
and
savannahs
opening
one
beyond
another
bounded
at
length
by
a
spacious
river
whose
end
and
beginning
were
equally
concealed
from
my
eye
i
was
now
so
weary
of
this
solitary
kind
of
life
that
i
began
to
consider
the
inhabitants
themselves
with
less
apprehension
besides
i
thought
myself
out
of
danger
of
meeting
with
the
hostile
tribes
and
all
these
people
unless
irritated
by
injuries
or
stimulated
by
revenge
are
perhaps
less
strangers
to
the
rights
of
hospitality
than
any
civilised
nation
i
therefore
reflected
that
by
directing
my
course
to
the
river
and
following
the
direction
of
its
waters
i
should
have
the
greatest
probability
of
meeting
with
some
of
my
as
the
natives
build
their
villages
near
lakes
and
streams
and
choose
their
banks
as
a
residence
when
they
are
employed
in
hunting
i
therefore
descended
the
mountain
and
entered
the
level
district
which
i
saw
before
me
and
then
marched
along
an
open
champaign
country
for
several
hours
covered
over
with
a
species
of
rank
grass
and
beheld
numerous
herds
of
buffaloes
grazing
all
around
it
was
here
that
an
accident
befel
me
which
i
will
relate
for
its
singularity
both
in
respect
to
the
dangers
i
incurred
and
my
method
of
escape
as
i
was
thus
journeying
on
i
discovered
a
prodigious
light
that
seemed
to
efface
the
sun
itself
and
streak
the
skies
with
an
angry
kind
of
illumination
i
looked
round
me
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
strange
appearance
and
beheld
with
equal
horror
and
astonishment
that
the
whole
country
behind
was
in
flames
in
order
to
explain
this
event
i
must
observe
that
all
the
plains
in
america
produce
a
rank
luxuriant
vegetation
the
juices
of
which
are
exhausted
by
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
it
is
then
as
inflammable
as
straw
or
fodder
and
when
a
casual
spark
of
fire
communicates
with
it
the
flame
frequently
drives
before
the
wind
for
miles
together
and
consumes
everything
it
meets
this
was
actually
the
case
at
present
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
the
country
was
all
in
flames
a
powerful
wind
added
fresh
fury
to
the
fire
and
drove
it
on
with
a
degree
of
swiftness
which
precluded
all
possibility
of
flight
i
must
confess
that
i
was
struck
with
horror
at
the
sudden
approach
of
a
death
so
new
so
dreadful
so
unexpected
i
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
fly
the
flaming
line
extended
for
several
miles
on
every
side
and
advanced
with
such
velocity
that
i
considered
my
fate
as
inevitable
i
looked
round
me
with
a
kind
of
mute
despair
and
began
to
envy
the
fate
of
my
comrades
who
had
fallen
by
honourable
wounds
in
battle
already
did
the
conflagration
scorch
me
in
its
approach
accompanied
by
clouds
of
smoke
that
almost
suffocated
me
with
their
baneful
vapour
in
this
extremity
providence
presented
to
my
mind
an
instantaneous
thought
which
perhaps
was
the
only
possible
method
of
escape
i
considered
that
nothing
could
stop
the
conflagration
but
an
actual
want
of
matter
to
continue
it
and
therefore
by
setting
fire
to
the
vegetables
before
me
i
might
follow
my
own
path
in
safety
i
hope
gentlemen
that
during
the
course
of
a
long
life
you
will
never
have
occasion
to
experience
the
pleasure
which
the
first
glance
of
this
expedient
afforded
to
my
mind
i
saw
myself
snatched
beyond
expectation
from
a
strange
and
painful
death
and
instantly
pulled
out
with
a
trembling
hand
the
flint
and
steel
upon
which
my
preservation
was
to
depend
i
struck
a
light
and
presently
kindled
the
driest
grass
before
me
the
conflagration
spread
along
the
country
the
wind
drove
it
on
with
inconceivable
fury
and
i
saw
the
path
of
my
deliverance
open
before
my
eyes
in
a
few
seconds
a
considerable
vacancy
was
burnt
before
me
which
i
traversed
with
the
speed
of
a
man
that
flies
from
instant
death
my
feet
were
scorched
with
the
glowing
soil
and
several
times
had
i
been
nearly
suffocated
with
the
drift
of
the
pursuing
smoke
but
every
step
i
made
convinced
me
of
the
certainty
of
my
escape
and
in
a
little
time
i
stopped
to
consider
at
leisure
the
conflagration
i
had
avoided
which
after
proceeding
to
the
point
whence
i
set
out
was
extinguished
as
i
had
foreseen
and
delivered
me
from
all
apprehension
i
declare
said
tommy
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
heard
and
yet
i
can
easily
conceive
it
for
once
i
saw
some
men
set
fire
to
the
heath
and
furzes
upon
the
common
and
they
burnt
so
furiously
that
i
was
quite
afraid
to
come
near
the
flame
i
pursued
my
way
continued
the
highlander
over
the
smoking
soil
which
i
had
rendered
bare
to
a
considerable
extent
and
lodged
at
night
as
usual
under
some
boughs
which
i
stuck
up
to
defend
me
in
the
morning
i
set
out
again
and
soon
arrived
at
a
spacious
lake
upon
whose
banks
i
could
plainly
discern
the
signs
of
an
american
encampment
i
hesitated
some
time
whether
i
should
again
conceal
myself
in
the
woods
or
deliver
myself
up
to
their
mercy
but
i
considered
that
it
was
impossible
long
to
continue
this
wandering
life
and
that
in
the
end
i
must
have
recourse
to
some
of
these
savage
tribes
for
assistance
what
therefore
must
be
done
at
last
it
was
fruitless
to
delay
i
had
every
reason
to
imagine
that
the
people
before
me
must
either
be
favourable
to
great
britain
or
at
least
indifferent
to
the
war
and
in
either
case
from
the
experience
i
possessed
of
the
manners
of
the
natives
i
did
not
think
i
had
much
to
fear
i
therefore
determined
to
hazard
everything
upon
the
probability
of
a
favourable
reception
and
collecting
all
my
resolution
i
marched
boldly
forward
and
soon
arrived
at
the
encampment
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
village
the
women
and
children
gathered
round
me
with
the
curiosity
natural
to
mankind
at
the
sight
of
an
unaccustomed
object
i
formed
a
favourable
conjecture
from
this
apparent
ignorance
of
europeans
and
walking
on
with
a
composed
step
and
steady
countenance
i
at
length
entered
into
one
of
the
largest
cabins
i
could
find
when
i
was
within
i
saw
a
venerable
old
man
whom
i
took
to
be
a
chief
from
his
appearance
sitting
at
his
ease
upon
the
ground
and
smoking
i
saluted
him
with
all
the
courtesy
i
was
able
and
placed
myself
upon
the
ground
at
some
little
distance
waiting
with
inward
anxiety
but
external
composure
for
him
to
begin
the
conversation
after
he
had
eyed
me
for
some
time
with
fixed
attention
but
without
either
sternness
or
anger
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
presented
it
to
me
i
received
it
with
infinite
satisfaction
for
as
i
have
before
remarked
this
is
always
with
the
american
tribes
the
firmest
pledge
of
peace
and
a
friendly
reception
when
we
had
thus
been
seated
for
some
time
in
mutual
contemplation
of
each
other
he
asked
me
in
a
dialect
which
i
understood
tolerably
well
to
eat
i
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
refuse
any
offered
civility
and
therefore
accepted
the
offer
and
in
a
little
time
a
young
woman
who
was
in
the
back
part
of
the
hut
set
before
me
some
broiled
fish
and
parched
maize
after
i
had
eaten
my
friendly
host
inquired
into
my
country
and
the
reasons
of
my
visit
i
was
just
enough
acquainted
with
the
language
he
spoke
to
be
able
to
understand
him
and
to
give
an
intelligible
though
imperfect
answer
i
therefore
explained
to
him
as
well
as
i
was
able
that
i
had
crossed
the
great
water
with
the
warriors
of
the
king
of
britain
that
we
had
been
compelled
to
take
up
the
hatchet
against
the
french
and
their
allies
and
that
we
had
actually
set
out
upon
an
expedition
against
their
colonies
but
that
we
had
been
surprised
by
a
lurking
party
in
the
woods
that
in
the
confusion
of
the
fight
i
had
been
separated
from
the
rest
and
had
wandered
several
days
through
the
woods
in
search
of
my
comrades
and
that
now
seeing
the
tents
of
my
brethren
the
red
men
i
had
come
to
visit
them
and
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
in
their
company
all
this
i
with
some
difficulty
explained
to
my
entertainer
who
listened
to
me
with
great
attention
and
then
bade
me
welcome
in
the
name
of
his
nation
which
he
told
me
was
called
the
he
added
their
young
men
were
dispersed
through
the
woods
hunting
the
deer
and
buffalo
but
they
would
soon
return
loaded
with
provisions
and
in
the
meantime
i
might
share
his
cabin
and
such
provisions
as
he
could
command
i
thanked
him
for
his
offer
and
remained
several
days
in
his
hut
always
entertained
with
the
same
hospitality
until
the
return
of
the
young
men
from
hunting
they
came
at
last
in
several
boats
along
the
lake
bringing
with
them
a
considerable
quantity
of
wild
beasts
which
they
had
killed
i
was
received
by
all
the
tribe
with
the
same
hospitality
i
had
experienced
from
the
old
chief
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
gain
their
friendship
as
much
as
possible
i
joined
them
in
all
their
hunting
and
fishing
parties
and
soon
acquired
a
considerable
degree
of
skill
in
both
hunting
itself
has
something
cruel
in
the
practice
it
is
a
species
of
war
which
we
wage
with
brute
animals
for
their
spoils
but
if
ever
it
can
be
considered
as
excusable
it
is
in
these
savage
nations
who
have
recourse
to
it
for
their
subsistence
they
are
active
bold
and
dexterous
in
all
these
exercises
to
such
a
degree
that
none
of
the
wild
animals
they
attack
have
the
smallest
chance
of
escape
their
parties
generally
consist
of
almost
all
the
youth
of
their
nation
who
go
in
a
body
to
particular
districts
where
they
know
game
is
plentiful
their
common
method
is
when
they
are
arrived
at
a
spot
which
abounds
in
deer
or
buffaloes
to
disperse
themselves
through
the
woods
and
then
alarming
the
beasts
in
the
neighbourhood
they
drive
them
with
shouts
and
dogs
towards
some
common
place
which
was
always
in
the
middle
of
all
their
parties
when
they
have
thus
roused
their
prey
the
various
squadrons
gradually
advance
towards
the
centre
till
they
unite
in
a
circle
and
enclose
a
prodigious
number
of
frightened
animals
they
then
attack
them
either
with
or
arrows
and
shoot
them
down
successively
by
these
means
they
are
sure
in
a
single
day
to
destroy
a
prodigious
number
of
different
beasts
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
while
they
are
engaged
in
the
chase
of
other
animals
they
become
a
prey
themselves
to
their
enemies
who
take
this
method
of
surprising
them
in
the
woods
and
gratifying
their
resentment
this
was
actually
the
case
with
my
friends
the
saukies
and
produced
a
surprising
event
the
consequence
of
which
was
my
return
to
the
english
colonies
in
safety
the
saukies
had
been
long
at
war
with
the
iroquese
a
powerful
tribe
of
north
americans
in
the
interest
of
the
french
the
iroquese
had
received
intelligence
of
the
situation
of
the
saukies
encampment
and
determined
to
surprise
them
for
this
purpose
a
thousand
warriors
set
out
by
a
secret
march
through
the
woods
and
travelled
with
silence
and
celerity
which
are
peculiar
to
all
these
nations
when
they
had
nearly
approached
the
of
their
enemies
they
happened
to
be
discovered
upon
their
march
by
four
warriors
of
another
nation
who
instantly
suspected
their
design
and
running
with
greater
diligence
than
it
was
possible
so
large
a
body
could
make
arrived
at
the
encampment
of
the
saukies
and
informed
them
of
the
near
approach
of
their
enemies
a
great
council
was
instantly
assembled
to
deliberate
upon
the
choice
of
proper
measures
for
their
defence
as
they
were
encumbered
with
their
families
it
was
impracticable
to
retreat
with
safety
and
it
seemed
equally
difficult
to
resist
so
large
a
force
with
inferior
numbers
while
they
were
in
this
uncertainty
i
considered
the
nature
of
their
situation
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
out
a
resource
which
being
communicated
to
my
friend
and
chief
and
adopted
by
the
nation
was
the
means
of
their
safety
i
observed
that
the
passage
to
the
saukie
camp
for
the
iroquese
lay
along
a
narrow
slip
of
land
which
extended
for
nearly
a
mile
between
two
lakes
i
therefore
advised
the
saukies
to
cast
up
a
strong
barrier
at
the
end
of
the
passage
which
i
showed
them
how
to
strengthen
with
ditches
palisades
and
some
of
the
improvements
of
the
european
fortification
their
number
of
warriors
amounted
to
about
four
hundred
these
i
divided
into
equal
parts
and
leaving
one
to
defend
the
lines
i
placed
the
other
in
ambuscade
along
the
neighbouring
woods
scarcely
were
these
dispositions
finished
before
the
iroquese
appeared
and
imagining
they
were
rushing
upon
an
unguarded
foe
entered
the
defile
without
hesitation
as
soon
as
the
whole
body
was
thus
imprudently
engaged
the
other
party
of
the
saukies
started
from
their
and
running
to
the
entrance
of
the
strait
threw
up
in
an
instant
another
fortification
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
the
whole
force
of
their
enemies
thus
circumvented
and
caught
in
a
trap
the
iroquese
soon
perceived
the
difficulty
and
danger
of
escape
they
however
behaved
with
that
extraordinary
composure
which
is
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
this
people
on
every
occasion
the
lakes
were
at
that
time
frozen
over
yet
not
so
hard
as
to
permit
them
to
effect
a
passage
over
the
ice
and
though
a
thaw
succeeded
in
a
short
time
it
was
equally
impracticable
to
pass
by
swimming
or
on
rafts
three
days
therefore
the
iroquese
remained
quiet
in
this
disagreeable
situation
and
as
if
they
had
nothing
to
apprehend
diverted
themselves
all
this
time
with
fishing
on
the
fourth
morning
they
judged
the
ice
sufficiently
dissolved
to
effect
their
escape
and
therefore
cutting
down
some
trees
which
grew
upon
the
strait
they
formed
them
into
rafts
and
embarked
their
whole
force
but
this
could
not
be
done
without
the
knowledge
of
the
saukies
who
despatched
a
considerable
body
of
warriors
to
oppose
their
landing
it
is
unnecessary
to
relate
all
the
horrid
particulars
of
the
engagement
which
ensued
i
will
only
mention
that
the
iroquese
at
length
effected
their
landing
with
the
loss
of
half
their
number
and
retreated
precipitately
to
their
own
country
leaving
behind
them
all
the
furs
and
skins
which
they
had
taken
in
their
hunting
the
share
i
had
had
in
this
success
gained
me
the
friendship
of
all
the
nation
and
at
my
desire
they
sent
some
of
their
young
men
to
guide
me
through
the
woods
to
the
english
settlements
and
they
took
their
leave
of
me
with
every
expression
of
esteem
and
a
considerable
present
of
valuable
furs
these
gentlemen
with
the
exception
of
one
adventure
when
i
was
attacked
by
three
fellows
two
of
whom
i
killed
and
the
other
fled
are
the
most
important
and
interesting
events
of
my
life
and
as
i
have
already
trespassed
too
long
upon
your
patience
i
shall
now
hasten
to
draw
my
story
to
a
conclusion
after
this
i
was
employed
in
various
parts
of
america
and
the
west
indies
during
the
rest
of
the
war
i
suffered
hardships
and
difficulties
innumerable
and
acquired
as
my
father
had
foretold
a
little
wisdom
at
the
price
of
a
considerable
quantity
of
blood
when
the
war
was
ended
i
found
myself
nearly
in
the
same
situation
as
i
began
except
the
present
of
my
friendly
americans
which
i
turned
into
money
and
remitted
to
england
i
therefore
now
began
to
feel
my
military
enthusiasm
abated
and
having
permission
to
leave
the
service
i
embraced
that
opportunity
of
returning
to
my
country
fully
determined
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
amid
my
family
and
friends
i
found
my
father
and
mother
still
living
who
received
me
in
the
fondest
manner
i
then
employed
the
little
fund
i
had
acquired
to
stock
a
farm
which
i
hired
in
the
neighbourhood
and
where
i
imagined
my
care
and
industry
would
be
sufficient
to
insure
us
all
a
comfortable
subsistence
some
little
time
after
i
married
a
virtuous
and
industrious
young
woman
the
mother
of
the
unfortunate
children
who
are
so
much
indebted
to
your
bounty
for
some
time
i
made
a
shift
to
succeed
tolerably
well
but
at
length
the
distresses
of
my
country
increasing
i
found
myself
involved
in
the
deepest
poverty
several
years
of
uncommon
severity
destroyed
my
cattle
which
is
the
chief
support
of
the
highlanders
and
rotted
away
the
scanty
crops
which
were
to
supply
us
with
food
upon
the
ground
i
can
not
accuse
myself
of
either
voluntary
unthriftiness
or
neglect
of
my
business
but
there
are
some
situations
in
which
it
seems
impossible
for
human
exertion
to
stem
the
torrent
of
misfortune
but
wherefore
should
i
give
pain
to
such
kind
and
worthy
benefactors
by
a
detail
of
all
the
miseries
which
i
and
many
of
my
poor
countrymen
have
endured
i
will
therefore
only
mention
that
after
having
suffered
i
think
every
distress
which
human
nature
is
equal
to
support
after
having
seen
my
tender
parents
and
last
my
dear
unfortunate
wife
perish
by
the
hardships
of
our
situation
i
took
the
resolution
of
abandoning
for
ever
a
country
which
seemed
incapable
of
supporting
its
inhabitants
i
thought
that
the
milder
climate
and
more
fertile
soil
of
america
might
perhaps
enable
a
wretched
wanderer
who
asked
no
more
than
food
for
his
starving
children
to
drag
on
a
little
longer
a
miserable
life
with
this
idea
i
sold
the
remainder
of
my
stock
and
after
having
paid
my
landlord
i
found
i
had
just
enough
to
transport
myself
and
family
into
eternal
banishment
i
reached
a
seaport
town
and
embarked
with
my
children
on
board
a
ship
that
was
setting
sail
for
philadelphia
but
the
same
seemed
still
to
accompany
my
steps
for
a
dreadful
storm
arose
which
after
having
tossed
our
vessel
during
several
days
wrecked
us
at
length
upon
the
coast
all
the
crew
indeed
escaped
and
with
an
infinite
difficulty
i
saved
these
dear
but
miserable
infants
who
now
accompany
me
but
when
i
reflect
on
my
situation
in
a
distant
country
without
resources
friends
or
hopes
i
am
almost
inclined
to
think
that
we
might
all
have
been
happier
in
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
here
the
highlander
finished
his
story
and
all
the
company
were
affected
by
the
recital
of
his
distresses
they
all
endeavoured
to
comfort
him
with
the
kindest
expressions
and
promises
of
assistance
but
miss
simmons
after
she
had
with
some
difficulty
composed
herself
enough
to
speak
asked
the
man
if
his
name
was
not
the
highlander
answered
with
some
surprise
it
was
then
said
she
you
will
find
that
you
have
a
friend
whom
as
yet
you
are
not
acquainted
with
who
has
both
the
ability
and
the
will
to
serve
you
that
friend
added
she
seeing
all
the
company
astonished
is
no
other
than
my
uncle
that
colonel
simmons
whom
you
have
described
with
so
much
feeling
and
affection
was
brother
to
my
father
and
consequently
uncle
to
myself
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
memory
of
such
a
man
should
be
venerated
by
his
relations
i
have
often
heard
my
uncle
speak
of
his
untimely
death
as
the
greatest
misfortune
which
ever
happened
to
our
family
and
i
have
often
seen
him
read
with
tears
in
his
eyes
many
of
his
brother
letters
in
which
he
speaks
with
the
greatest
affection
of
his
faithful
highlander
andrew
campbell
at
these
words
the
poor
highlander
unable
to
repress
the
strong
emotions
of
his
mind
sprang
forward
in
a
sudden
transport
of
joy
and
without
consideration
of
circumstances
caught
miss
simmons
in
his
arms
exclaiming
at
the
same
time
praised
be
to
god
for
this
happy
and
unexpected
meeting
blessed
be
my
shipwreck
itself
that
has
given
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
before
i
die
some
of
the
blood
of
my
dear
and
worthy
colonel
and
perceiving
miss
simmons
confused
at
this
abrupt
and
unexpected
salutation
he
added
in
the
most
respectful
manner
pardon
me
my
honoured
young
lady
for
the
improper
liberty
i
have
taken
but
i
was
not
master
of
myself
to
find
at
a
time
when
i
thought
myself
the
most
forlorn
and
miserable
of
the
human
race
that
i
was
in
company
with
the
nearest
relation
of
the
man
whom
after
my
own
father
i
have
always
loved
and
reverenced
most
miss
simmons
answered
with
the
greatest
affability
that
she
freely
excused
the
warmth
of
his
affection
and
that
she
would
that
very
day
acquaint
her
uncle
with
this
extraordinary
event
who
she
did
not
doubt
would
come
over
with
the
greatest
expedition
to
see
a
person
whom
he
knew
so
well
by
name
and
who
could
inform
him
of
so
many
particulars
of
her
uncle
and
now
the
company
being
separated
tommy
who
had
listened
with
silent
attention
to
the
story
of
the
highlander
took
an
opportunity
of
following
mr
barlow
who
was
walking
out
and
when
he
perceived
they
were
alone
he
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
some
weighty
matter
to
disclose
but
was
unable
to
give
it
utterance
mr
barlow
therefore
turned
towards
him
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
taking
him
tenderly
by
the
hand
inquired
what
he
wished
indeed
answered
tommy
almost
crying
i
am
scarcely
able
to
tell
you
but
i
have
been
a
very
bad
and
ungrateful
boy
and
i
am
afraid
you
no
longer
have
the
same
affection
for
me
if
you
are
sensible
of
your
faults
my
little
friend
that
is
a
very
great
step
towards
amending
them
let
me
therefore
know
what
it
is
the
recollection
of
which
distresses
you
so
much
and
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
assist
in
making
you
easy
there
is
nothing
i
am
sure
which
i
shall
be
inclined
to
refuse
you
oh
sir
your
speaking
to
me
with
so
much
goodness
hurts
me
a
great
deal
more
than
if
you
were
to
be
very
angry
for
when
people
are
angry
and
passionate
one
does
not
so
much
mind
what
they
say
but
when
you
speak
with
so
much
kindness
it
seems
to
pierce
me
to
the
very
heart
because
i
know
i
have
not
deserved
it
but
if
you
are
sensible
of
having
committed
any
faults
you
may
resolve
to
behave
so
well
for
the
future
that
you
may
deserve
everybody
friendship
and
esteem
few
people
are
so
perfect
as
not
to
err
sometimes
and
if
you
are
convinced
of
your
errors
you
will
be
more
cautious
how
you
give
way
to
them
a
second
time
indeed
sir
i
am
very
happy
to
hear
you
say
so
i
will
then
tell
you
everything
which
lies
so
heavy
upon
my
mind
you
must
know
then
sir
that
although
i
have
lived
so
long
with
you
and
during
all
that
time
you
have
taken
so
much
pains
to
improve
me
in
everything
and
teach
me
to
act
well
to
everybody
i
had
no
sooner
quitted
your
sight
than
i
became
i
think
a
worse
boy
than
ever
i
was
before
but
why
do
you
judge
so
severely
of
yourself
as
to
think
you
were
become
worse
than
ever
perhaps
you
have
been
a
little
thoughtless
and
giddy
and
these
are
faults
which
i
can
not
with
truth
say
you
were
ever
free
from
no
sir
what
i
have
been
guilty
of
is
infinitely
worse
than
ever
i
have
always
been
very
giddy
and
very
thoughtless
but
i
never
imagined
i
could
have
been
the
most
insolent
and
ungrateful
boy
in
the
world
you
frighten
me
my
little
friend
is
it
possible
you
can
have
committed
actions
that
deserve
so
harsh
a
name
you
shall
judge
yourself
sir
for
now
i
have
begun
i
am
determined
to
tell
you
all
you
know
sir
that
when
i
first
came
to
you
i
had
a
high
opinion
of
myself
for
being
born
a
gentleman
and
a
very
great
contempt
for
everybody
in
an
inferior
station
i
must
confess
you
have
always
had
some
tendency
to
both
these
follies
yes
sir
but
you
have
so
often
laughed
at
me
upon
the
subject
and
shown
me
the
folly
of
people
imagining
themselves
better
than
others
without
any
merit
of
their
own
that
i
was
grown
a
little
wiser
besides
i
have
so
often
observed
that
those
i
despised
could
do
a
variety
of
things
which
i
was
ignorant
of
while
those
who
are
vain
of
being
gentlemen
can
do
nothing
useful
or
ingenious
so
that
i
had
begun
to
be
ashamed
of
my
folly
but
since
i
came
home
i
have
kept
company
with
a
great
many
fine
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
thought
themselves
superior
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
used
to
despise
every
one
else
and
they
have
made
me
forget
everything
i
learned
before
perhaps
then
i
was
mistaken
when
i
taught
you
that
the
greatest
merit
any
person
could
have
is
to
be
good
and
useful
these
fine
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
may
be
wiser
and
have
given
you
better
lessons
if
that
is
the
case
you
will
have
great
reason
to
rejoice
that
you
have
changed
so
much
for
the
better
no
sir
no
i
never
thought
them
either
good
or
wise
for
they
know
nothing
but
how
to
dress
their
hair
and
buckle
their
shoes
but
they
persuaded
me
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
polite
and
talked
to
me
so
often
upon
the
subject
that
i
could
not
help
believing
them
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
it
is
necessary
for
everybody
to
be
polite
they
therefore
i
suppose
instructed
you
to
be
more
obliging
and
civil
in
your
manners
than
ever
you
were
before
instead
of
doing
you
any
hurt
this
will
be
the
greatest
improvement
you
can
receive
no
sir
quite
the
contrary
instead
of
teaching
me
to
be
civil
and
obliging
they
have
made
me
ruder
and
worse
behaved
than
ever
i
was
before
if
that
is
the
case
i
fear
these
fine
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
undertook
to
teach
you
more
than
they
understood
themselves
indeed
sir
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
myself
but
i
did
not
think
so
then
and
therefore
i
did
whatever
i
observed
them
do
and
talked
in
the
same
manner
as
i
heard
them
talk
they
used
to
be
always
laughing
at
harry
sandford
and
i
grew
so
foolish
that
i
did
not
choose
to
keep
company
with
him
any
longer
that
was
a
pity
because
i
am
convinced
he
really
loves
you
however
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
for
he
has
employment
enough
at
home
and
however
ingenious
you
may
be
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
learn
how
to
manage
his
land
or
raise
food
from
your
conversation
it
will
therefore
be
better
for
him
to
converse
with
farmers
and
leave
you
to
the
society
of
gentlemen
indeed
this
i
know
has
always
been
his
taste
and
had
not
your
father
pressed
him
very
much
to
accompany
you
home
he
would
have
liked
much
better
to
have
avoided
the
visit
however
i
will
inform
him
that
you
have
gained
other
friends
and
advise
him
for
the
future
to
avoid
your
company
oh
sir
i
did
not
think
you
could
be
so
cruel
i
love
harry
sandford
better
than
any
other
boy
in
the
world
and
i
shall
never
be
happy
till
he
forgives
me
all
my
bad
behaviour
and
converses
with
me
again
as
he
used
to
do
but
then
perhaps
you
may
lose
the
acquaintance
of
all
those
polite
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
i
care
very
little
about
that
sir
but
i
fear
i
have
behaved
so
ill
that
he
never
will
be
able
to
forgive
me
and
love
me
as
he
did
formerly
tommy
then
went
on
and
repeated
with
great
exactness
the
story
of
his
insolence
and
ingratitude
which
had
so
great
an
effect
upon
him
that
he
burst
into
tears
and
cried
a
considerable
time
he
then
concluded
with
asking
mr
barlow
if
he
thought
harry
would
be
ever
able
to
forgive
him
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
my
little
friend
that
you
have
acted
very
ill
indeed
in
this
affair
however
if
you
are
really
ashamed
of
all
your
past
conduct
and
determined
to
act
better
i
do
not
doubt
that
so
generous
and
a
boy
as
harry
is
will
forgive
you
all
oh
sir
i
should
be
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
bring
him
here
to
day
and
you
shall
see
how
i
will
behave
softly
tommy
softly
what
is
harry
to
come
here
for
have
you
not
insulted
and
abused
him
without
reason
and
at
last
proceeded
so
far
as
to
strike
him
only
because
he
was
giving
you
the
best
advice
and
endeavouring
to
preserve
you
from
danger
can
you
imagine
that
any
human
being
will
come
to
you
in
return
for
such
treatment
at
least
till
you
have
convinced
him
that
you
are
ashamed
of
your
passion
and
injustice
and
that
he
may
expect
better
usage
for
the
future
what
then
must
i
do
sir
if
you
want
any
future
connection
with
harry
sandford
it
is
your
business
to
go
to
him
and
tell
him
so
what
sir
go
to
a
farmer
to
expose
myself
before
all
his
family
just
now
you
told
me
you
were
ready
to
do
everything
and
yet
you
can
not
take
the
trouble
of
visiting
your
friend
at
his
own
house
you
then
imagine
that
a
person
does
not
expose
himself
by
acting
wrong
but
by
acknowledging
and
amending
his
faults
but
what
would
everybody
say
if
a
young
gentleman
like
me
was
to
go
and
beg
pardon
of
a
farmer
son
they
would
probably
say
that
you
have
more
sense
and
gratitude
than
they
expected
however
you
are
to
act
as
you
please
with
the
sentiments
you
still
seem
to
entertain
harry
will
certainly
be
a
very
unfit
companion
and
you
will
do
much
better
to
cultivate
the
new
acquaintance
you
have
made
mr
barlow
was
then
going
away
but
tommy
burst
again
into
tears
and
begged
him
not
to
go
upon
which
mr
barlow
said
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
tommy
but
our
conversation
is
now
at
an
end
you
have
asked
my
advice
which
i
have
given
you
freely
i
have
told
you
how
you
ought
to
act
if
you
would
preserve
the
esteem
of
any
good
or
sensible
friend
or
prevail
upon
harry
to
excuse
your
past
behaviour
but
as
you
do
not
approve
of
what
i
suggested
you
must
follow
your
own
opinion
pray
sir
pray
sir
said
tommy
sobbing
do
not
go
i
have
used
harry
sandford
in
the
most
barbarous
manner
my
father
is
angry
with
me
and
if
you
desert
me
i
shall
have
no
friend
left
in
the
world
that
will
be
your
own
fault
and
therefore
you
will
not
deserve
to
be
pitied
is
it
not
in
your
own
power
to
preserve
all
your
friends
by
an
honest
confession
of
your
faults
your
father
will
be
pleased
harry
sandford
will
heartily
forgive
you
and
i
shall
retain
the
same
good
opinion
of
your
character
which
i
have
long
had
and
is
it
really
possible
sir
that
you
should
have
a
good
opinion
of
me
after
all
i
have
told
you
about
myself
i
have
always
thought
you
a
little
vain
and
careless
i
confess
but
at
the
same
time
i
imagined
you
had
both
good
sense
and
generosity
in
your
character
i
depended
upon
to
make
you
see
your
faults
and
upon
the
to
correct
them
dear
sir
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
you
have
always
been
extremely
kind
and
friendly
to
me
and
therefore
i
told
your
father
yesterday
who
is
very
much
hurt
at
your
quarrel
with
harry
that
though
a
sudden
passion
might
have
transported
you
too
far
yet
when
you
came
to
consider
the
matter
coolly
you
would
perceive
your
faults
and
acknowledge
them
were
you
not
to
behave
in
this
manner
i
owned
i
could
say
nothing
in
your
favour
and
i
was
very
much
confirmed
in
this
opinion
when
i
saw
the
courage
you
exerted
in
the
rescue
of
harry
lamb
and
the
compassion
you
felt
for
the
poor
highlander
a
boy
said
i
who
has
so
many
excellent
dispositions
can
never
persist
in
bad
behaviour
he
may
do
wrong
by
accident
but
he
will
be
ashamed
of
his
errors
and
endeavour
to
repair
them
by
a
frank
and
generous
acknowledgment
this
has
always
been
the
conduct
of
really
great
and
elevated
minds
while
mean
and
grovelling
ones
alone
imagine
that
it
is
necessary
to
persist
in
faults
they
have
once
committed
oh
sir
i
will
go
directly
and
entreat
harry
to
forgive
me
i
am
convinced
that
all
you
say
is
right
but
will
you
not
go
with
me
do
pray
sir
be
so
good
gently
gently
my
young
friend
you
are
always
for
doing
everything
in
an
instant
i
am
very
glad
you
have
taken
a
resolution
which
will
do
you
so
much
credit
and
give
so
much
satisfaction
to
your
own
mind
but
before
you
execute
it
i
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
speak
to
your
father
and
mother
upon
the
subject
and
in
the
mean
time
i
will
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
farmer
sandford
and
bring
you
an
account
of
harry
do
sir
be
so
good
and
tell
harry
if
you
please
that
there
is
nothing
i
desire
so
much
as
to
see
him
and
that
nothing
shall
ever
make
me
behave
ill
again
i
have
heard
too
sir
that
there
was
a
poor
black
came
begging
to
us
who
saved
harry
from
the
bull
if
i
could
but
find
him
out
i
would
be
good
to
him
as
long
as
i
live
mr
barlow
commended
tommy
very
much
for
dispositions
so
full
of
gratitude
and
goodness
and
taking
leave
of
him
went
to
communicate
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
to
mr
merton
that
gentleman
felt
the
sincerest
pleasure
at
the
account
and
entreated
mr
barlow
to
go
directly
to
prepare
harry
to
receive
his
son
that
little
boy
observed
he
has
the
noblest
mind
that
ever
adorned
a
human
being
nor
shall
i
ever
be
happy
till
i
see
my
son
acknowledging
all
his
faults
and
entreating
forgiveness
for
with
the
virtues
that
i
have
discovered
in
his
soul
he
appears
to
me
a
more
eligible
friend
and
companion
than
noblemen
or
princes
mr
barlow
therefore
set
out
on
foot
though
mr
merton
would
have
sent
his
carriage
and
servants
to
attend
him
and
soon
arrived
at
mr
sandford
farm
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
situated
upon
the
gentle
declivity
of
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
winded
along
a
swift
and
clear
little
stream
the
house
itself
was
small
but
warm
and
convenient
furnished
with
the
greatest
simplicity
but
managed
with
perfect
neatness
as
mr
barlow
approached
he
saw
the
owner
himself
guiding
a
plough
through
one
of
his
own
fields
and
harry
who
had
now
resumed
the
farmer
directed
the
horses
but
when
he
saw
mr
barlow
coming
across
the
field
he
stopped
his
team
and
letting
fall
his
whip
sprang
forward
to
meet
him
with
all
the
unaffected
eagerness
of
joy
as
soon
as
harry
had
saluted
mr
barlow
and
inquired
after
his
health
he
asked
with
the
greatest
kindness
after
tommy
for
i
fancy
sir
said
he
by
the
way
which
i
see
you
come
you
have
been
at
mr
merton
house
indeed
i
have
replied
mr
barlow
but
i
am
very
sorry
to
find
that
tommy
and
you
are
not
upon
as
good
terms
as
you
formerly
were
indeed
sir
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
myself
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
given
master
merton
any
reason
to
change
his
sentiments
about
me
and
though
i
do
not
think
he
has
treated
me
as
well
as
he
ought
to
do
i
have
the
greatest
desire
to
hear
that
he
is
well
that
you
might
have
known
yourself
had
you
not
left
mr
merton
house
so
suddenly
without
taking
leave
of
any
one
even
your
friend
mr
merton
who
has
always
treated
you
with
so
much
kindness
indeed
sir
i
should
be
very
unhappy
if
you
think
i
have
done
wrong
but
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
how
i
could
have
acted
otherwise
i
am
very
sorry
to
appear
to
accuse
master
merton
neither
do
i
bear
any
resentment
against
him
for
what
he
has
done
but
since
you
speak
to
me
upon
the
subject
i
shall
be
obliged
to
tell
the
truth
well
harry
let
me
hear
it
you
know
i
shall
be
the
last
person
to
condemn
you
if
you
do
not
deserve
it
i
know
your
constant
kindness
to
me
sir
and
i
always
confide
in
it
however
i
am
not
sensible
that
i
am
in
fault
you
know
sir
that
it
was
with
unwillingness
i
went
to
mr
merton
for
i
thought
there
would
be
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
there
who
would
ridicule
my
dress
and
manners
and
though
master
merton
has
been
always
very
friendly
in
his
behaviour
towards
me
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
might
grow
ashamed
of
my
company
at
his
own
house
do
you
wonder
at
that
harry
considering
the
difference
there
is
in
your
rank
and
fortune
no
sir
i
can
not
say
i
do
for
i
generally
observe
that
those
who
are
rich
will
scarcely
treat
the
poor
with
common
civility
but
in
this
particular
case
i
did
not
see
any
reason
for
it
i
never
desired
master
merton
to
admit
me
to
his
company
or
invite
me
to
his
house
because
i
knew
that
i
was
born
and
in
a
very
inferior
station
you
were
so
good
as
to
take
me
to
your
house
and
if
i
was
then
much
in
his
company
it
was
because
he
seemed
to
desire
it
himself
and
i
always
endeavoured
to
treat
him
with
the
greatest
respect
that
is
indeed
true
harry
in
all
your
little
plays
and
studies
i
have
never
observed
anything
but
the
greatest
mildness
and
good
nature
on
your
part
i
hope
sir
it
has
never
been
otherwise
but
though
i
had
the
greatest
affection
for
master
merton
i
never
desired
to
go
home
with
him
what
sort
of
a
figure
could
a
poor
boy
like
me
make
at
a
gentleman
table
among
little
masters
and
misses
that
powder
their
hair
and
wear
buckles
as
big
as
our
horses
carry
upon
their
harness
if
i
attempted
to
speak
i
was
always
laughed
at
or
if
i
did
anything
i
was
sure
to
hear
something
about
clowns
and
rustics
and
yet
i
think
though
they
were
all
gentlemen
and
ladies
you
would
not
much
have
approved
of
their
conversation
for
it
was
about
nothing
but
plays
and
dress
and
trifles
of
that
nature
i
never
heard
one
of
them
mention
a
single
word
about
saying
their
prayers
or
being
dutiful
to
their
parents
or
doing
any
good
to
the
poor
well
harry
but
if
you
did
not
like
their
conversation
you
surely
might
have
borne
it
with
patience
for
a
little
while
and
then
i
heard
something
about
your
being
quarrelsome
oh
sir
i
hope
not
i
was
to
be
sure
once
a
little
passionate
but
that
i
could
not
help
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
there
was
a
modest
sensible
young
lady
who
was
the
only
person
that
treated
me
with
any
kindness
and
a
bold
forward
boy
affronted
her
in
the
grossest
manner
only
because
she
took
notice
of
me
could
i
help
taking
her
part
have
you
not
told
me
too
sir
that
every
person
though
he
should
avoid
quarrels
has
a
right
to
defend
himself
when
he
is
attacked
well
harry
i
do
not
much
blame
you
from
the
circumstances
i
have
heard
of
that
affair
but
why
did
you
leave
mr
merton
family
so
abruptly
without
speaking
to
anybody
or
thanking
mr
merton
himself
for
the
civilities
he
had
shown
you
was
that
right
oh
dear
sir
i
have
cried
about
it
several
times
for
i
think
it
must
appear
very
rude
and
ungrateful
to
mr
merton
but
as
to
master
tommy
i
did
not
leave
him
while
i
thought
i
could
be
of
any
use
he
treated
me
i
must
say
in
a
very
unworthy
manner
he
joined
with
all
the
other
fine
little
gentlemen
in
abusing
me
only
because
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
not
to
go
to
a
and
then
at
last
he
struck
me
i
did
not
strike
him
again
because
i
loved
him
so
much
in
spite
of
all
his
unkindness
nor
did
i
leave
him
till
i
saw
he
was
quite
safe
in
the
hands
of
his
own
servants
and
then
how
could
i
go
back
to
his
house
after
what
he
had
done
to
me
i
did
not
choose
to
complain
of
him
to
mr
merton
and
how
could
i
behave
to
him
as
i
had
done
before
without
being
guilty
of
meanness
and
falsehood
and
therefore
i
thought
it
better
to
go
home
and
desire
you
to
speak
to
mr
merton
and
entreat
him
to
forgive
my
rudeness
well
harry
i
can
inform
you
that
mr
merton
is
perfectly
satisfied
on
that
account
but
there
is
one
circumstance
you
have
not
mentioned
my
little
friend
and
that
is
your
saving
tommy
life
from
the
fury
of
the
enraged
bull
as
to
that
sir
i
hope
i
should
have
done
the
same
for
any
human
creature
but
i
believe
that
neither
of
us
would
have
escaped
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
poor
courageous
black
that
came
to
our
assistance
i
see
harry
that
you
are
a
boy
of
a
noble
and
generous
spirit
and
i
highly
approve
of
everything
you
have
done
but
are
you
determined
to
forsake
tommy
merton
for
ever
because
he
has
once
behaved
ill
i
sir
no
i
am
sure
but
though
i
am
poor
i
do
not
desire
the
acquaintance
of
anybody
that
despises
me
let
him
keep
company
with
his
gentlemen
and
ladies
i
am
satisfied
with
companions
in
my
own
station
but
surely
sir
it
is
not
that
forsake
him
but
that
has
cast
me
off
but
if
he
is
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
and
only
desires
to
acknowledge
his
faults
and
obtain
your
pardon
oh
dear
sir
i
should
forget
everything
in
an
instant
i
knew
master
tommy
was
always
a
little
passionate
and
headstrong
but
he
is
at
the
same
time
generous
and
nor
would
he
i
am
sure
have
treated
me
so
ill
if
he
had
not
been
encouraged
to
it
by
the
other
young
gentlemen
well
harry
i
believe
your
friend
is
thoroughly
sensible
of
his
faults
and
that
you
will
have
little
to
fear
for
the
future
he
is
impatient
till
he
sees
you
and
asks
your
forgiveness
oh
sir
i
should
forgive
him
if
he
had
beaten
me
a
hundred
times
but
though
i
can
not
leave
the
horses
now
if
you
will
be
so
kind
to
wait
a
little
i
daresay
my
father
will
let
me
go
when
he
leaves
off
ploughing
no
harry
there
is
no
occasion
for
that
tommy
has
indeed
used
you
ill
and
ought
to
acknowledge
it
otherwise
he
will
not
deserve
to
be
trusted
again
he
will
call
upon
you
and
tell
you
all
he
feels
on
the
occasion
in
the
mean
time
i
was
desired
both
by
him
and
mr
merton
to
inquire
after
the
poor
negro
that
served
you
so
materially
and
saved
you
from
the
bull
he
is
at
our
house
sir
for
i
invited
him
home
with
me
and
when
my
father
heard
how
well
he
had
behaved
he
made
him
up
a
little
bed
over
the
stable
and
gives
him
victuals
every
day
and
the
poor
man
seems
very
thankful
and
industrious
and
says
he
would
gladly
do
any
kind
of
work
to
earn
his
subsistence
mr
barlow
then
took
his
leave
of
harry
and
after
having
spoken
to
his
father
returned
to
mr
merton
during
mr
barlow
absence
mr
simmons
had
arrived
there
to
fetch
away
his
niece
but
when
he
had
heard
the
story
of
the
highlander
he
perfectly
recollected
his
name
and
character
and
was
touched
with
the
sincerest
compassion
for
his
sufferings
on
conversing
with
the
poor
man
he
found
that
he
was
extremely
well
acquainted
with
agriculture
as
well
as
truly
industrious
and
therefore
instantly
proposed
to
settle
him
in
a
small
farm
of
his
own
which
happened
to
be
vacant
the
poor
man
received
this
unexpected
change
in
his
fortune
with
tears
of
joy
and
every
mark
of
unaffected
gratitude
and
mr
merton
who
never
wanted
generosity
insisted
upon
having
a
share
in
his
establishment
he
was
proposing
to
supply
him
with
the
necessary
implements
of
agriculture
and
a
couple
of
horses
to
begin
the
culture
of
his
land
just
at
the
moment
when
mr
barlow
entered
who
when
he
had
heard
with
the
sincerest
pleasure
the
improvement
of
the
poor
man
circumstances
begged
permission
to
share
in
so
benevolent
an
action
i
have
an
excellent
said
he
which
i
can
very
well
spare
whose
milk
will
speedily
recruit
the
strength
of
these
poor
children
and
i
have
ewes
and
a
ram
which
i
hope
under
mr
management
will
soon
increase
to
a
numerous
flock
the
poor
highlander
seemed
almost
frantic
with
such
a
profusion
of
unexpected
blessings
and
said
that
he
wished
nothing
more
than
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
such
a
generous
nation
and
to
be
enabled
to
show
at
least
the
sentiments
which
such
undeserved
generosity
had
excited
at
night
mr
merton
who
was
desirous
by
every
method
to
support
the
good
impressions
which
had
now
taken
possession
of
tommy
mind
proposed
that
miss
simmons
should
favour
them
with
the
conclusion
of
the
story
which
she
had
begun
the
night
before
the
young
lady
instantly
complied
and
then
read
them
conclusion
of
the
story
of
sophron
and
the
venerable
chares
continued
his
narration
thus
passed
several
months
among
the
arabians
delighted
with
the
simplicity
of
their
life
and
the
innocence
of
their
manners
and
would
to
heaven
added
he
with
a
sigh
i
had
accepted
their
friendly
invitations
and
never
quitted
the
silence
of
their
hospitable
deserts
how
many
scenes
should
i
have
avoided
which
fill
these
aged
eyes
with
tears
and
pierce
my
soul
with
horror
as
often
as
i
recollect
them
i
should
not
have
been
witness
to
such
a
waste
of
human
blood
nor
traced
the
gradual
ruin
of
my
country
i
should
not
have
seen
our
towns
involved
in
flames
nor
our
helpless
children
the
captives
of
fell
barbarians
but
it
is
in
vain
for
human
beings
to
repine
at
the
just
decrees
of
providence
which
have
consigned
every
people
to
misery
and
servitude
that
abandon
virtue
and
attach
themselves
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
left
arabia
with
a
heart
penetrated
with
gratitude
and
admiration
for
its
virtuous
and
benevolent
inhabitants
they
dismissed
me
with
every
mark
of
kindness
and
hospitality
guided
me
over
their
dreary
deserts
and
at
parting
presented
me
with
one
of
those
beautiful
horses
which
are
the
admiration
of
all
the
surrounding
nations
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
an
account
of
the
different
countries
which
i
wandered
over
in
search
of
wisdom
and
experience
at
length
i
returned
to
my
native
city
determined
to
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
in
obscurity
and
retirement
for
the
result
of
all
my
observations
was
that
he
is
happiest
who
passes
his
time
in
innocent
employments
and
the
observation
of
nature
i
had
seen
the
princes
and
nobles
of
the
earth
repining
in
the
midst
of
their
splendid
enjoyments
disgusted
with
the
empty
pageantry
of
their
situation
and
wishing
in
vain
for
the
humble
tranquillity
of
private
life
i
had
visited
many
of
the
principal
cities
in
several
countries
where
i
had
travelled
but
i
had
uniformly
observed
that
the
miseries
and
crimes
of
mankind
increased
with
their
numbers
i
therefore
determined
to
avoid
the
general
contagion
by
fixing
my
abode
in
some
sequestered
spot
at
a
distance
from
the
passions
and
pursuits
of
my
therefore
collected
the
remainder
of
my
effects
and
with
them
purchased
a
little
farm
and
vineyard
in
a
beautiful
and
solitary
spot
near
the
sea
i
soon
afterwards
married
a
virtuous
young
woman
and
in
her
society
enjoyed
for
several
years
as
great
a
degree
of
tranquillity
as
generally
falls
to
the
lot
of
man
i
did
not
disdain
to
exercise
with
my
own
hands
the
different
employments
of
agriculture
for
i
thought
man
was
dishonoured
by
that
indolence
which
renders
him
a
burthen
to
his
not
by
that
industry
which
is
necessary
to
the
support
of
his
species
i
therefore
sometimes
guided
the
plough
with
my
own
hands
sometimes
laboured
in
a
little
garden
which
supplied
us
with
excellent
fruits
and
herbs
i
likewise
tended
the
cattle
whose
patient
labour
enabled
us
to
subdue
the
soil
and
considered
myself
as
only
repaying
part
of
the
obligations
i
had
received
my
wife
too
exercised
herself
in
domestic
cares
she
milked
the
sheep
and
goats
and
chiefly
prepared
the
food
of
the
family
my
other
employments
i
did
not
entirely
forget
the
study
of
philosophy
which
had
charmed
me
so
much
in
my
early
youth
i
frequently
observed
with
admiration
the
wisdom
and
contrivance
which
were
displayed
in
all
the
productions
of
nature
and
the
perfection
of
all
her
works
i
used
to
walk
amid
the
coolness
and
stillness
of
the
evening
feeding
my
mind
with
pleasing
meditations
upon
the
power
and
wisdom
which
have
originally
produced
and
still
support
this
frame
of
things
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
earth
and
saw
it
covered
with
innumerable
animals
that
sported
upon
its
surface
and
found
each
according
to
his
nature
subsistence
adapted
to
his
wants
i
saw
the
air
and
water
themselves
teeming
with
life
and
peopled
with
innumerable
swarms
of
insects
i
saw
that
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
creation
as
far
as
i
was
capable
of
observing
it
nothing
was
waste
or
desolate
everything
was
replete
with
life
and
adapted
to
support
it
these
reflections
continually
excited
in
my
mind
new
gratitude
and
veneration
for
that
mysterious
being
whose
goodness
presides
over
such
an
infinite
variety
of
beings
i
endeavoured
to
elevate
my
thoughts
to
contemplate
his
nature
and
qualities
i
however
found
my
faculties
too
bounded
to
comprehend
the
infinite
perfections
of
his
nature
i
therefore
contented
myself
with
imperfectly
tracing
him
in
his
works
and
adoring
him
as
the
common
friend
and
parent
of
all
his
creatures
did
i
confine
myself
to
these
speculations
however
sublime
and
consolatory
to
the
human
heart
destined
as
we
are
to
inhabit
this
globe
of
earth
it
is
our
interest
to
be
acquainted
with
its
nature
and
the
properties
of
its
productions
for
this
reason
i
particularly
examined
all
the
vegetables
which
are
capable
of
becoming
the
food
of
man
or
of
the
various
animals
which
contribute
to
his
support
i
studied
their
qualities
the
soil
in
which
they
delighted
and
the
improvements
which
might
be
made
in
every
species
i
sometimes
wandered
among
the
neighbouring
mountains
and
wherever
the
fall
of
rocks
or
the
repeated
violence
of
torrents
had
borne
away
the
soil
i
considered
with
silent
admiration
the
various
substances
which
we
call
by
the
common
name
of
these
i
used
to
collect
and
mingle
with
the
mould
of
my
own
garden
by
which
means
i
frequently
made
useful
discoveries
in
fertilising
the
soil
and
increasing
the
quantity
of
food
also
considered
the
qualities
of
the
air
which
surrounds
and
sustains
all
living
animals
i
particularly
remarked
the
noxious
or
salutary
effects
it
is
able
to
produce
upon
their
constitutions
and
by
these
means
was
frequently
enabled
to
give
useful
counsels
to
all
the
neighbourhood
a
large
tract
of
ground
had
been
formerly
deluged
by
the
sea
and
the
waters
finding
no
convenient
vent
spread
themselves
all
around
and
converted
a
large
extent
of
soil
into
a
filthy
marsh
every
year
when
the
heat
of
summer
prevailed
the
atmosphere
was
filled
with
putrid
exhalations
which
produced
fevers
and
pestilential
disorders
among
the
inhabitants
touched
with
compassion
for
the
evils
which
they
endured
i
persuaded
them
to
undertake
the
task
of
draining
the
soil
and
letting
off
the
superfluous
waters
this
i
instructed
them
to
do
with
such
success
that
in
a
short
time
an
unwholesome
desert
became
covered
with
the
most
luxuriant
harvests
and
was
deprived
of
all
its
noxious
influence
by
thus
rendering
my
services
useful
to
my
i
received
the
purest
reward
which
can
attend
the
increase
of
knowledge
the
consciousness
of
performing
my
duty
and
humbly
imitating
that
being
whose
goodness
is
as
general
and
unbounded
as
his
power
these
tranquil
and
innocent
employments
my
life
flowed
gently
away
like
a
clear
and
even
stream
i
was
a
stranger
to
avarice
or
ambition
and
to
all
the
cares
which
agitate
the
bulk
of
mortals
alternate
labour
and
study
preserved
the
vigour
both
of
body
and
mind
our
wants
were
few
and
easily
gratified
we
chiefly
subsisted
upon
the
liberal
returns
of
the
earth
and
seldom
polluted
our
table
with
the
bodies
of
slaughtered
animals
one
only
child
the
unfortunate
girl
who
owes
her
preservation
to
the
courage
of
this
young
man
was
granted
to
our
prayers
but
in
her
we
found
enough
to
exercise
all
the
affections
of
our
minds
we
hung
with
ecstasy
upon
her
innocent
smiles
and
remarked
her
opening
graces
with
all
the
partiality
of
parental
fondness
as
she
grew
up
her
mother
instructed
her
in
all
the
arts
and
employments
of
her
sex
while
i
who
already
saw
the
tempest
gathering
which
has
since
burst
with
such
fatal
fury
upon
my
country
thought
it
necessary
to
arm
her
mind
with
all
the
firmness
which
education
can
bestow
for
this
reason
i
endeavoured
to
give
both
her
mind
and
body
a
degree
of
vigour
which
is
seldom
found
in
the
female
sex
soon
as
selene
for
that
was
her
name
was
sufficiently
advanced
in
strength
to
be
capable
of
the
lighter
labours
of
husbandry
and
gardening
i
employed
her
as
my
constant
companion
and
she
soon
acquired
a
dexterity
in
all
the
rustic
employments
which
i
considered
with
equal
pleasure
and
admiration
if
women
are
in
general
feeble
both
in
body
and
mind
it
arises
less
from
nature
than
from
education
encourage
a
vicious
indolence
and
inactivity
which
we
falsely
call
delicacy
instead
of
hardening
their
minds
by
the
severer
principles
of
reason
and
philosophy
we
breed
them
to
useless
arts
which
terminate
in
vanity
and
sensuality
in
most
of
the
countries
which
i
had
visited
they
are
taught
nothing
of
a
higher
nature
than
a
few
modulations
of
the
voice
or
useless
postures
of
the
body
their
time
is
consumed
in
sloth
or
trifles
and
trifles

the
only
pursuit
capable
of
interesting
them

to
forget
that
it
is
upon
the
qualities
of
the
female
sex
that
our
own
domestic
comforts
and
the
education
of
our
children
must
depend
and
what
are
the
comforts
or
the
education
which
a
race
of
beings
corrupted
from
their
infancy
and
unacquainted
with
all
the
duties
of
life
are
fitted
to
bestow
to
touch
a
musical
instrument
with
useless
skill
to
exhibit
their
natural
or
affected
graces
to
the
eyes
of
indolent
and
debauched
young
men
to
dissipate
their
patrimony
in
riotous
and
unnecessary
expenses
these
are
the
only
arts
cultivated
by
women
in
most
of
the
polished
nations
i
had
seen
and
the
consequences
are
uniformly
such
as
may
be
expected
to
proceed
from
such
polluted
sources
private
misery
and
public
servitude
selene
education
was
regulated
by
different
views
and
conducted
upon
severer
principles
if
that
can
be
called
which
opens
the
mind
to
a
sense
of
moral
and
religious
duties
and
most
effectually
arms
it
against
the
inevitable
evils
of
life
with
the
rising
sun
she
left
her
bed
and
accompanied
me
to
the
garden
or
the
vineyard
her
little
hands
were
employed
in
shortening
the
luxurious
shoots
of
fruitful
trees
that
supplied
our
table
with
wholesome
and
delicious
fruits
or
in
supporting
the
branches
of
such
as
sunk
beneath
their
load
sometimes
she
collected
water
from
a
clear
and
constant
rill
that
rolled
along
the
valley
and
recruited
the
force
of
plants
that
were
exhausted
by
the
sun
with
what
delight
did
i
view
her
innocent
cheerfulness
and
assiduity
with
what
pleasure
did
she
receive
the
praises
which
i
gave
to
her
skill
and
industry
or
hear
the
lessons
of
wisdom
and
the
examples
of
virtuous
women
which
i
used
to
read
to
her
at
evening
out
of
the
writings
of
celebrated
philosophers
which
i
had
collected
in
my
travels
such
a
life
was
too
unchecquered
with
misfortune
to
last
the
first
stroke
which
attacked
and
almost
destroyed
my
hopes
of
good
was
the
untimely
loss
of
my
dear
and
virtuous
wife
the
pestilential
heats
of
autumn
overpowered
her
tender
frame
and
raised
a
consuming
fever
in
her
veins
for
some
time
she
struggled
against
the
disease
but
at
length
her
pure
and
innocent
spirit
forsook
this
earth
for
ever
and
left
me
comfortless
and
forlorn
to
mourn
her
loss
will
not
my
worthy
hosts
attempt
to
describe
the
inexpressible
distress
which
seized
my
soul
at
seeing
myself
thus
deserted
there
are
some
philosophers
who
aspire
to
triumph
over
human
feelings
and
consider
all
tender
affections
as
disgraceful
weaknesses
for
my
part
i
have
never
pretended
to
that
degree
in
insensibility
i
have
indeed
opposed
as
criminal
that
habitual
acquiescence
in
sorrow
which
renders
us
unfit
for
the
discharge
of
our
duties
but
while
i
have
endeavoured
to
i
have
never
blushed
at
like
a
man
even
now
that
time
has
mitigated
the
keenness
of
the
smart
i
feel
the
habitual
anguish
of
an
incurable
wound
but
let
me
rather
hasten
to
relate
the
few
remaining
events
of
a
uniform
unvaried
life
than
detain
you
with
a
useless
repetition
of
my
sorrows
had
time
afforded
me
a
feeble
comfort
when
the
recollection
of
past
misfortunes
was
almost
extinguished
by
the
new
ones
which
overwhelmed
my
country
the
fertile
plains
of
syria
abounded
in
all
the
necessaries
and
conveniences
of
life
the
vine
seemed
to
grow
spontaneously
in
every
valley
and
offer
its
luxuriant
produce
to
every
hand
the
industrious
insect
which
spins
the
wonderful
substance
called
out
of
its
bowels
though
lately
introduced
into
that
part
of
asia
seemed
to
receive
new
vigour
from
the
mildness
of
the
climate
corn
and
oil
the
noblest
fruits
and
the
most
salubrious
herbs
were
found
in
the
garden
of
every
peasant
and
the
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
which
wandered
over
our
luxuriant
pastures
equalled
or
surpassed
all
i
had
observed
in
other
countries
but
this
profusion
of
blessings
instead
of
being
attended
with
any
beneficial
effects
produced
nothing
but
a
foolish
taste
for
frivolous
employment
and
sensuality
feasts
and
dances
and
music
and
tricks
of
players
and
exhibitions
of
buffoons
were
more
attended
to
than
all
the
serious
and
important
cares
of
life
every
young
man
was
a
critic
in
the
science
of
adjusting
the
folds
of
his
robe
or
of
giving
a
studied
negligence
to
his
hair
every
young
woman
was
instructed
in
every
art
that
serves
to
consume
time
or
endanger
modesty
repeat
to
them
an
idle
tale
the
tricks
of
a
gamester
or
the
adventures
of
a
and
every
audience
listened
with
mute
attention
to
the
wonderful
narration
but
tell
them
of
the
situation
of
their
country
the
wretched
state
of
their
civil
and
military
discipline
or
of
the
numerous
and
warlike
tribes
of
barbarians
which
surround
them
and
every
auditor
would
steal
away
in
silence
and
leave
the
uninteresting
theme
such
a
state
of
things
it
was
not
long
to
be
expected
that
my
countrymen
would
be
permitted
to
hold
the
riches
they
abused
and
wanted
firmness
to
defend
a
warlike
tribe
of
barbarians
burst
forth
from
the
northern
mountains
of
asia
and
spread
themselves
over
our
fertile
plains
which
they
laid
waste
like
a
consuming
tempest
after
a
few
ineffectual
skirmishes
which
only
served
to
expose
their
weakness
to
the
contempt
of
their
enemies
they
yielded
without
opposition
to
the
invader
in
this
indeed
more
wise
than
to
irritate
him
by
a
fruitless
resistance
and
thus
in
a
few
weeks
the
leader
of
an
obscure
tribe
of
barbarians
saw
himself
become
a
powerful
monarch
and
possessor
of
one
of
the
richest
provinces
of
asia
was
sitting
one
evening
at
the
door
of
my
cottage
gazing
upon
the
fading
glory
of
the
setting
sun
when
a
man
of
a
majestic
appearance
but
with
something
ferocious
in
his
look
attended
by
several
others
passed
by
as
he
approached
my
little
garden
he
seemed
to
view
it
with
satisfaction
and
to
unbend
the
habitual
sternness
of
his
look
i
asked
him
if
he
would
enter
in
and
taste
the
fruits
with
his
companions
he
accepted
my
offer
and
entering
into
a
shady
arbour
i
brought
him
the
most
palatable
fruits
i
could
find
with
milk
and
other
rustic
fare
such
as
my
farm
afforded
he
seemed
pleased
with
his
entertainment
and
when
he
was
departing
thanked
me
with
great
affability
and
bade
me
ask
a
favour
in
return
added
he
with
a
certain
degree
of
conscious
pride
can
scarcely
make
too
great
either
for
my
gratitude
or
power
answered
i
for
i
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
arsaces
the
leader
of
these
barbarians
power
is
indeed
equal
to
every
boon
give
peace
and
liberty
to
my
country
first
said
he
have
already
given
and
as
to
the
second
it
is
impossible
their
vices
and
effeminacy
render
them
incapable
of
enjoying
it
men
that
have
neither
virtue
temperance
nor
valour
can
never
want
a
master
even
though
arsaces
were
to
withdraw
his
conquering
troops
ask
again
added
he
for
thyself
and
let
the
favour
be
worthy
me
to
bestow
answered
i
with
a
smile
already
given
everything
i
can
want
when
it
gave
the
earth
fertility
and
me
the
power
to
labour
all
therefore
that
i
request
o
mighty
conqueror
is
that
you
will
please
to
order
your
men
to
step
aside
from
the
newly
cultivated
ground
and
not
destroy
my
vegetables
heaven
said
arsaces
turning
to
his
companions
is
something
elevated
in
the
tranquillity
and
composure
of
this
man
mind
and
was
i
not
i
should
be
with
pleasure
he
then
departed
but
ordered
me
to
attend
him
the
next
day
at
the
camp
and
gave
strict
orders
that
none
of
the
soldiers
should
molest
or
injure
my
humble
residence
attended
the
great
arsaces
at
the
time
he
had
appointed
and
traversed
the
encampment
of
his
troop
with
admiration
and
regret
this
people
was
a
tribe
of
that
mighty
empire
which
is
called
whose
inhabitants
have
so
often
issued
from
their
deserts
for
the
conquest
and
destruction
of
their
neighbours
country
extends
to
an
unknown
length
behind
the
most
fertile
districts
of
europe
and
asia
the
climate
is
cold
in
winter
and
the
earth
for
several
months
covered
with
snow
but
in
summer
it
feels
the
enlivening
influence
of
the
sun
and
for
that
reason
is
possessed
of
an
amazing
degree
of
fertility
but
as
the
inhabitants
live
remote
from
the
sea
and
possess
few
navigable
rivers
they
are
little
acquainted
with
agriculture
or
the
arts
of
life
instead
of
trusting
to
the
increase
of
their
fields
for
food
they
raise
prodigious
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
in
the
luxuriant
pastures
which
everywhere
abound
the
scythians
like
the
arabians
wander
over
these
immense
spaces
without
a
fixed
or
permanent
residence
by
the
side
of
lakes
and
rivers
where
the
verdure
is
most
constant
and
the
vegetation
stronger
they
generally
encamp
until
the
heats
of
the
summer
compel
them
to
ascend
the
mountains
and
seek
a
cooler
residence
their
houses
are
composed
of
slender
poles
covered
with
skins
or
a
coarse
cloth
and
therefore
easily
erected
or
taken
down
and
stowed
in
waggons
for
the
convenience
of
transporting
them
in
their
marches
their
diet
is
answerable
to
the
poverty
of
their
habitations
they
milk
their
herds
and
above
all
their
mares
and
preserve
the
produce
in
large
bottles
for
months
together
this
sour
and
homely
mess
is
to
them
the
greatest
dainty
and
composes
the
chief
of
their
nourishment
to
this
they
add
the
flesh
of
their
cattle
and
horses
which
they
kill
when
afflicted
with
disease
but
rarely
in
health
is
the
simple
and
uniform
life
of
all
the
scythians
but
this
simplicity
renders
them
formidable
to
all
their
neighbours
and
irresistible
in
war
unsoftened
by
ease
or
luxury
unacquainted
with
the
artificial
wants
of
life
these
nations
pass
their
lives
in
manly
exercises
and
rustic
employments
but
horsemanship
is
the
greatest
pride
and
passion
of
their
souls
nor
is
there
an
individual
who
does
not
at
least
possess
several
of
these
noble
animals
which
though
small
in
size
are
admirably
adapted
for
the
fatigues
of
war
and
the
chase
and
endowed
with
incomparable
swiftness
as
to
the
scythians
themselves
they
excel
all
other
nations
unless
it
be
the
arabs
in
their
courage
and
address
in
riding
without
a
saddle
or
even
a
bridle
their
young
men
will
vault
upon
an
unbacked
courser
and
keep
their
seats
in
spite
of
all
his
violent
efforts
till
they
have
rendered
him
tame
and
obedient
to
their
will
in
their
military
expeditions
they
neither
regard
the
obstacles
of
nature
nor
the
inclemency
of
the
season
and
their
horses
are
accustomed
to
traverse
rocks
and
mountains
with
a
facility
that
is
incredible
if
they
reach
a
river
instead
of
waiting
for
the
tedious
assistance
of
boats
and
bridges
the
warrior
divests
himself
of
his
clothes
and
arms
which
he
places
in
a
bundle
upon
the
horse
back
and
then
plunging
into
the
stream
conducts
him
over
by
the
bridle
even
in
the
midst
of
winter
when
the
hatred
of
other
nations
gives
way
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
season
the
scythian
follows
his
military
labours
and
rejoices
to
see
the
earth
thick
covered
with
frost
and
snow
because
it
affords
him
a
solid
path
in
his
excursions
neither
the
severest
cold
nor
the
most
violent
storms
can
check
his
ardour
wrapped
up
in
the
thick
furs
of
animals
the
patient
horseman
pursues
his
march
while
all
his
food
for
weeks
together
is
comprised
in
a
little
bag
of
seeds
or
corn
javelins
and
bows
and
arrows
are
the
arms
which
these
people
are
taught
from
their
infancy
to
use
with
surprising
dexterity
and
no
less
dangerous
when
they
fly
than
when
they
charge
the
enemy
in
front
they
are
accustomed
to
shoot
with
an
unerring
aim
at
their
pursuers
and
turn
the
fortune
of
the
battle
such
men
are
scarcely
to
be
conquered
by
the
efforts
of
the
most
powerful
nations
or
sovereigns
and
therefore
the
proudest
conquerors
of
the
world
have
failed
in
their
attempts
to
subdue
them
one
of
the
greatest
kings
which
the
vast
empire
of
persia
ever
obeyed
once
attempted
the
exploit
and
had
nearly
perished
in
the
attempt
he
advanced
with
a
powerful
army
but
ill
prepared
for
such
an
expedition
into
the
scythian
wastes
the
inhabitants
well
acquainted
with
the
most
effectual
methods
of
defence
transported
their
families
and
herds
into
the
interior
parts
of
the
country
and
mounting
their
fleetest
horses
seemed
to
fly
before
the
monarch
who
infatuated
with
pride
and
confidence
pursued
the
chase
for
several
days
until
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
solitary
deserts
totally
destitute
of
all
that
human
wants
require
where
his
army
could
neither
advance
nor
retire
without
equal
danger
of
perishing
by
thirst
and
famine
when
the
scythian
horsemen
saw
him
thus
involved
they
began
to
check
their
speed
instead
of
flying
as
usual
they
hemmed
him
in
on
every
side
and
harassed
the
army
with
continual
attacks
it
was
then
they
sent
a
present
to
the
persian
king
the
mysterious
meaning
of
which
increased
the
terrors
of
his
situation
a
scythian
mounted
upon
a
fiery
steed
entered
the
camp
at
full
speed
and
regardless
of
danger
or
opposition
penetrated
even
to
the
royal
tent
where
darius
was
holding
a
council
with
his
nobles
while
they
were
all
amazed
at
this
extraordinary
boldness
the
man
leaped
lightly
from
his
horse
and
placing
a
little
bundle
upon
the
ground
vaulted
up
again
with
inconceivable
agility
and
retired
with
the
same
happy
expedition
the
curiosity
of
the
monarch
made
him
instantly
order
the
packet
to
be
examined
which
contained
only
a
mouse
a
bird
a
fish
and
a
bundle
of
arrows
silence
and
astonishment
for
some
time
seized
the
assembly
till
at
length
the
king
observed
that
he
thought
the
present
which
the
scythians
had
sent
could
signify
nothing
but
their
submission
to
his
arms
mouse
said
he
represent
the
earth
because
he
resides
in
holes
which
he
digs
in
the
soil
the
fish
inhabits
the
water
and
the
bird
resides
in
the
air
by
sending
me
therefore
all
these
various
animals
they
mean
to
signify
that
they
resign
their
air
their
waters
and
their
earth
to
my
dominion
nor
is
the
bundle
of
arrows
more
difficult
to
be
explained
these
constitute
their
principal
defence
and
by
sending
them
to
an
enemy
they
can
intimate
nothing
but
terror
and
submission
all
who
were
present
applauded
this
discourse
of
the
monarch
excepting
gobrias
a
man
of
singular
wisdom
and
experience
who
when
he
was
pressed
to
declare
his
sentiments
spoke
to
him
thus
is
with
the
greatest
reluctance
o
king
that
i
find
myself
compelled
to
explain
these
presents
of
our
enemies
in
a
very
different
manner
that
the
scythians
who
have
hitherto
shown
no
marks
either
of
fear
or
submission
should
on
a
sudden
feel
so
great
a
terror
of
the
persian
arms
i
can
not
easily
believe
more
especially
when
i
consider
that
our
army
is
very
much
reduced
by
the
distress
it
has
suffered
and
environed
on
every
side
by
the
enemy
whose
boldness
visibly
increases
with
our
necessities
what
therefore
i
should
infer
from
this
extraordinary
present
is
this
they
intimate
that
unless
like
the
mouse
you
can
dig
your
passage
through
the
earth
or
skim
the
air
like
the
bird
or
glide
through
waters
with
the
fish
you
shall
certainly
perish
by
the
scythian
arrows
such
was
the
sentiment
of
gobrias
and
all
the
assembly
was
struck
with
the
evident
truth
of
his
interpretation
and
the
king
himself
began
to
perceive
and
repent
his
rashness
instead
therefore
of
advancing
farther
into
deserts
which
afforded
no
subsistence
he
resolved
to
attempt
a
retreat
this
however
he
was
not
able
to
effect
without
the
loss
of
the
greatest
part
of
his
troops
who
perished
by
thirst
and
famine
and
the
continued
attacks
of
the
enemy
was
the
expedition
of
lysimachus
another
powerful
king
against
this
people
less
memorable
or
less
unfortunate
his
army
was
defeated
and
he
himself
taken
prisoner
but
instead
of
meeting
with
that
cruelty
which
we
are
accustomed
to
expect
from
barbarians
he
experienced
the
greatest
moderation
and
humanity
from
his
conquerors
the
general
of
the
scythians
invited
his
captive
to
a
solemn
festival
in
which
he
took
care
to
assemble
every
circumstance
of
luxury
and
magnificence
which
prevailed
in
polished
nations
the
most
exquisite
meats
were
served
up
to
table
and
the
most
generous
wines
sparkled
in
golden
bowls
of
the
exactest
workmanship
lysimachus
was
equally
delighted
with
the
elegance
of
the
repast
and
the
politeness
of
the
entertainer
but
he
was
extremely
surprised
that
instead
of
sharing
in
the
feast
or
even
sitting
down
at
table
the
scythian
leader
reposed
in
the
corner
of
a
tent
upon
the
bare
ground
and
satisfied
his
hunger
with
the
most
coarse
and
ordinary
fare
prepared
with
all
the
simplicity
of
his
country
manners
when
the
entertainment
was
finished
he
asked
lysimachus
which
method
of
life
appeared
to
him
the
most
agreeable
lysimachus
could
not
conceal
his
preference
of
the
more
refined
and
luxurious
dainties
or
his
dislike
of
the
scythian
diet
therefore
replied
his
generous
host
feel
so
great
a
contempt
for
what
this
country
produces
and
so
strong
a
preference
for
the
productions
of
your
own
what
but
madness
o
king
can
have
tempted
you
to
come
so
far
in
order
to
subdue
men
that
live
in
a
manner
you
despise
is
it
not
much
greater
wisdom
to
be
contented
with
those
advantages
which
you
prize
so
highly
than
to
expose
them
to
a
certain
hazard
for
the
chance
of
acquiring
what
would
afford
no
pleasure
or
satisfaction
but
let
this
lesson
be
sufficient
to
teach
you
moderation
a
country
which
produces
nothing
but
iron
is
not
easily
conquered
nor
are
men
who
have
been
from
their
infancy
inured
to
every
hardship
to
be
vanquished
by
curled
and
perfumed
soldiers
who
can
not
live
without
baths
and
music
and
daily
feasts
be
contented
therefore
for
the
future
to
number
the
scythians
among
your
friends
and
rather
pray
that
the
gods
may
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
the
superiority
of
your
method
of
living
lest
a
desire
of
tasting
it
should
tempt
them
to
desert
their
own
country
and
invade
yours
with
this
discourse
he
generously
restored
lysimachus
to
liberty
and
suffered
him
to
lead
back
the
shattered
remains
of
his
numerous
army
was
the
nation
which
had
invaded
syria
and
easily
triumphed
over
the
efforts
of
an
effeminate
and
unwarlike
people
as
i
passed
through
the
camp
i
was
astonished
at
the
order
and
regularity
which
prevailed
among
these
barbarians
some
were
exercising
their
horses
in
the
mimic
representation
of
a
battle
part
fled
with
incredible
speed
while
the
rest
pursued
and
darted
blunted
javelins
at
their
antagonists
yet
even
those
who
fled
would
frequently
turn
upon
their
pursuers
and
make
them
repent
their
rashness
some
while
their
horses
were
running
in
full
speed
would
vault
from
off
their
backs
to
others
that
accompanied
them
some
would
gallop
by
a
mark
erected
for
their
arrows
and
when
they
had
passed
it
a
considerable
way
turn
themselves
round
upon
their
horses
and
transfix
it
with
an
unerring
aim
i
saw
many
who
vaulted
upon
their
horses
and
placed
themselves
between
two
naked
swords
which
would
have
given
them
certain
death
had
they
swerved
ever
so
little
from
the
just
direction
in
another
part
of
the
camp
i
observed
the
children
who
imitated
all
the
actions
of
their
fathers
bended
little
bows
adapted
to
their
strength
or
guided
horses
of
an
inferior
stature
along
the
plain
their
women
were
indeed
inferior
to
the
syrians
in
beauty
and
elegance
but
seemed
to
be
of
a
more
robust
constitution
and
more
adapted
to
produce
and
educate
warriors
i
saw
no
gold
no
jewels
no
vain
and
costly
apparel
but
all
seemed
busy
in
domestic
cares
preparing
the
food
of
their
families
or
tending
upon
their
infants
length
i
reached
the
royal
tent
which
scarcely
differed
from
the
rest
in
its
structure
or
simplicity
and
was
immediately
introduced
to
the
great
arsaces
he
received
me
with
a
courtesy
which
had
nothing
of
the
barbarian
in
it
seated
me
familiarly
by
his
side
and
entered
into
a
long
conversation
with
me
upon
the
laws
and
manners
and
customs
of
the
different
nations
i
had
seen
i
was
surprised
at
the
vigour
and
penetration
which
i
discovered
in
this
untutored
warrior
mind
unbiassed
by
the
mass
of
prejudices
which
we
acquire
in
cities
even
from
our
earliest
childhood
unencumbered
by
forms
and
ceremonies
which
contract
the
understanding
while
they
pretend
to
improve
the
manners
he
seemed
to
possess
a
certain
energy
of
soul
which
never
missed
the
mark
nature
in
him
had
produced
the
same
effects
that
study
and
philosophy
do
in
others
but
what
amazed
me
more
than
all
was
to
find
this
scythian
chief
as
well
acquainted
with
the
state
and
consequence
of
manners
as
if
he
had
passed
his
life
in
greece
or
syria
instead
of
the
plains
and
forests
of
his
own
domain
he
entertained
a
rooted
contempt
for
all
the
arts
which
softened
the
body
and
mind
under
the
pretence
of
adding
to
the
elegancies
of
life
these
he
said
were
more
efficacious
agents
to
reduce
men
to
slavery
than
the
swords
and
arrows
of
their
enemies
day
i
remember
that
some
of
our
principal
men
judging
of
the
mind
of
their
conqueror
by
their
own
brought
to
him
a
celebrated
dancer
who
at
that
time
engaged
the
whole
attention
of
our
city
and
seemed
to
interest
it
much
more
than
the
loss
of
liberty
this
man
who
did
not
doubt
that
he
should
enchant
the
soul
of
a
scythian
barbarian
by
the
same
arts
which
had
enraptured
his
refined
audiences
at
home
exerted
himself
with
an
agility
that
extorted
the
loudest
applause
from
all
the
spectators
but
arsaces
at
length
one
of
our
countrymen
took
the
liberty
of
asking
the
monarch
what
he
thought
of
this
extraordinary
performance
think
replied
he
coldly
it
would
gain
him
great
credit
among
a
nation
of
monkeys
another
time
he
was
present
at
the
exhibitions
of
a
celebrated
musician
who
was
reputed
to
possess
unrivalled
skill
in
playing
soft
and
melting
tunes
upon
the
lyre
all
the
audience
seemed
to
feel
the
influence
of
his
art
by
their
inarticulate
murmurs
of
admiration
and
the
languishing
postures
of
their
bodies
when
the
exhibition
was
finished
the
musician
advanced
amid
the
united
plaudits
of
the
audience
as
if
to
receive
the
just
tribute
of
approbation
from
arsaces
but
he
with
a
stern
look
said
to
him
i
permit
thee
to
play
every
night
before
the
syrians
but
if
thy
lyre
is
ever
heard
to
sound
in
the
presence
of
my
scythians
i
denounce
certain
death
for
the
offence
another
time
an
officious
glutton
of
our
city
introduced
to
him
with
great
solemnity
two
men
whose
talents
he
assured
him
were
unequalled
in
their
different
professions
the
one
he
said
adjusted
hair
with
such
dexterity
that
he
could
give
an
artificial
beauty
to
every
countenance
and
the
other
possessed
such
unrivalled
skill
in
cooking
a
repast
that
even
the
soberest
guest
was
tempted
to
commit
intemperance
soldiers
replied
arsaces
accustomed
to
adjust
their
locks
with
the
point
of
their
arrows
nor
does
our
nation
consider
a
bloated
paunch
and
an
unwieldy
shape
as
any
accomplishment
in
warriors
all
therefore
that
i
can
do
for
these
gentlemen
is
to
depute
one
of
them
to
comb
my
tail
and
the
other
to
feed
the
hogs
of
the
army
i
had
conversed
some
time
with
this
barbarian
chief
who
heard
me
with
the
greatest
attention
the
hour
of
refreshment
for
the
army
approached
and
i
was
preparing
to
retire
but
the
general
stopped
me
with
a
smile
and
told
me
i
had
already
entertained
him
with
the
greatest
hospitality
and
that
therefore
it
was
just
that
i
should
stay
and
taste
the
scythian
food
a
bit
of
dried
flesh
which
i
afterwards
found
was
that
of
a
horse
some
sour
coagulated
milk
with
an
infusion
of
certain
herbs
thickened
with
a
coarse
kind
of
flour
were
then
brought
in
and
placed
upon
the
ground
i
had
learned
during
my
travels
in
different
countries
to
discard
the
false
antipathies
which
so
many
nations
entertain
against
the
diet
as
well
as
manners
of
each
other
whatever
is
adapted
to
support
life
is
proper
for
the
food
of
man
habit
will
reconcile
us
to
any
kind
of
food
and
he
that
can
accustom
himself
to
be
the
most
easily
contented
is
happiest
and
best
prepared
for
performing
the
duties
of
life
i
therefore
placed
myself
by
the
side
of
arsaces
and
fed
without
any
visible
repugnance
upon
the
diet
which
would
have
excited
abhorrence
in
the
minds
of
all
my
countrymen
with
them
it
was
a
work
of
the
greatest
importance
to
settle
the
formalities
of
a
meal
to
contrive
a
new
and
poignant
sauce
to
combine
contrary
flavours
in
a
pickle
to
stimulate
the
jaded
appetite
to
new
exertions
till
reason
and
everything
human
sank
under
the
undigested
mass
of
food
were
reckoned
the
highest
efforts
of
genius
even
the
magistrate
did
not
blush
to
display
a
greater
knowledge
of
cookery
than
of
the
laws
the
debates
of
the
senate
itself
were
often
suspended
by
the
fear
of
losing
a
repast
and
many
of
our
generals
prided
themselves
more
on
the
arrangement
of
their
tables
than
the
martial
evolutions
of
their
troops
we
had
eaten
some
time
arsaces
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
scythian
method
of
living
speak
my
sentiments
said
i
is
more
formidable
to
your
enemies
than
agreeable
to
your
friends
he
smiled
at
my
sincerity
and
i
departed
but
from
this
hour
he
distinguished
me
with
marks
of
peculiar
favour
and
admitted
me
to
all
his
councils
envied
mark
of
distinction
gave
me
no
other
pleasure
than
as
it
sometimes
enabled
me
to
be
useful
to
my
unhappy
countrymen
and
mitigate
the
rigour
of
their
conquerors
indeed
while
the
great
arsaces
lived
his
love
of
justice
and
order
was
so
great
that
even
the
conquered
were
safe
from
all
oppression
the
peasant
pursued
his
useful
labours
unterrified
by
the
march
of
armies
or
unsolicited
brought
the
produce
of
his
fields
to
a
voluntary
market
merchants
from
all
the
neighbouring
nations
crowded
to
our
ports
attracted
by
the
order
and
justice
which
were
enforced
in
every
part
of
arsaces
dominions
and
even
the
vanquished
themselves
defended
from
oppression
and
protected
in
their
possessions
considered
the
success
of
the
scythians
rather
as
a
salutary
revolution
than
as
a
barbarian
conquest
was
the
pleasing
prospect
of
affairs
when
an
unexpected
disease
the
consequence
of
unremitted
exertions
put
an
end
to
the
glorious
life
of
our
conqueror
and
with
him
perished
all
hopes
of
safety
or
happiness
of
the
syrians
his
authority
alone
was
capable
of
restraining
so
many
needy
chieftains
so
many
victorious
barbarians
the
spirit
of
rapine
and
plunder
so
long
represt
began
now
to
spread
through
all
the
army
every
officer
was
an
independent
tyrant
that
ruled
with
despotic
authority
and
punished
as
rebellion
the
least
opposition
to
his
will
the
fields
were
now
ravaged
the
cities
plundered
the
industrious
peasants
driven
away
like
herds
of
cattle
to
labour
for
the
caprice
of
unfeeling
masters
or
sold
in
distant
regions
as
slaves
now
it
was
that
the
miserable
and
harassed
syrians
began
to
find
that
the
riches
which
they
so
much
esteemed
were
but
the
causes
of
their
ruin
instead
of
being
instrumental
to
their
safety
the
poor
accustomed
to
hardship
have
little
to
fear
amid
the
vicissitudes
of
life
the
brave
can
always
find
a
refuge
in
their
own
valour
but
all
the
bitterness
of
existence
is
reserved
for
those
who
have
neither
courage
to
defend
what
they
most
value
nor
fortitude
to
bear
the
loss
increase
the
weight
of
our
misfortunes
new
tribes
of
barbarians
attracted
by
the
success
of
their
countrymen
issued
from
their
deserts
and
hastened
to
share
the
spoil
but
rapine
admits
not
faith
or
partnership
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
vanquished
beheld
their
conquerors
animated
by
implacable
rage
against
each
other
and
suffering
in
turn
the
violence
and
cruelties
they
had
inflicted
length
one
of
the
principal
officers
of
arsaces
who
is
said
originally
to
have
descended
from
the
mountain
which
you
inhabit
was
raised
to
empire
by
the
successful
efforts
of
his
soldiers
he
has
already
attacked
and
destroyed
all
his
competitors
and
assembled
under
his
banners
the
remainder
of
their
forces
for
thus
he
is
named
possesses
all
the
courage
and
activity
of
arsaces
but
he
is
destitute
of
his
generosity
and
clemency
his
ambition
is
vast
and
boundless
he
grasps
at
universal
empire
and
rejoices
to
scatter
ruin
and
destruction
in
his
way
he
has
already
subjected
all
the
maritime
cities
that
derive
their
origin
from
greece
together
with
the
fertile
plains
of
syria
these
mountains
inhabited
by
a
bold
and
hardy
race
of
men
now
present
a
barrier
to
his
enterprising
spirit
and
i
am
assured
he
already
meditates
the
conquest
his
soldiers
are
drawn
together
from
every
part
and
nothing
can
escape
their
fury
in
vain
did
i
think
myself
safe
in
the
humble
obscurity
of
my
cottage
and
the
reputed
favour
of
the
great
arsaces
yesterday
a
lawless
band
not
contented
with
destroying
my
harvest
and
plundering
my
little
property
seized
my
daughter
and
me
and
dragged
us
away
in
chains
what
farther
injuries
what
farther
insults
we
might
have
suffered
it
is
impossible
to
determine
since
heaven
was
pleased
to
effect
our
deliverance
when
we
had
least
reason
to
expect
it
such
was
the
history
of
chares
which
sophron
and
his
family
listened
to
with
fixed
attention
when
he
had
finished
the
father
of
sophron
again
embraced
the
venerable
stranger
and
assured
him
of
all
the
safety
which
their
mountains
could
bestow
added
he
so
imminent
a
danger
is
near
it
behoves
us
to
consult
for
the
general
safety
let
us
assemble
all
our
friends
and
neighbours
that
they
may
consider
whether
life
is
of
more
consequence
than
liberty
and
if
they
determine
to
retain
that
freedom
which
they
have
received
from
their
ancestors
by
what
means
it
maybe
best
defended
sophron
then
immediately
went
out
and
ascending
a
neighbouring
rock
thus
shouted
out
in
a
voice
that
echoed
over
the
neighbouring
valleys
o
ye
inhabitants
of
lebanon
and
instantly
meet
in
council
for
a
powerful
invader
is
near
and
threatens
you
with
death
or
slavery
this
sound
was
instantly
repeated
by
all
who
heard
it
so
that
in
a
short
time
the
intelligence
was
dispersed
to
the
very
confines
of
the
country
it
was
not
long
before
a
numerous
assembly
was
convened
the
aged
appeared
with
all
the
majestic
dignity
of
wisdom
and
experience
their
countenances
indeed
indicated
the
ravages
of
time
but
temperance
and
exercise
had
preserved
them
from
the
loathsome
diseases
which
grow
on
luxury
and
indolence
they
were
attended
by
their
sons
in
all
the
pride
of
youth
and
vigour
who
rushed
along
in
arms
and
seemed
to
breathe
deliberate
rage
and
unconquerable
opposition
when
they
were
all
assembled
on
a
spacious
plain
sophron
rose
and
with
a
becoming
modesty
recited
the
adventures
of
the
preceding
night
and
the
alarming
intelligence
he
had
just
received
he
had
scarcely
finished
before
a
general
cry
of
indignation
burst
unanimously
from
the
whole
assembly
when
it
had
a
little
subsided
a
venerable
old
man
whose
beard
white
as
the
snow
upon
the
summits
of
the
mountains
reaching
down
to
his
middle
slowly
arose
and
leaning
upon
his
staff
spoke
thus
years
have
i
tended
my
flocks
amid
these
mountains
and
during
all
that
time
i
have
never
seen
a
human
being
who
was
bold
enough
to
propose
to
the
inhabitants
of
lebanon
that
they
should
fear
death
more
than
infamy
or
submit
to
the
vassals
of
a
tyrant
at
this
a
second
cry
which
seemed
to
rend
the
very
heavens
was
raised
and
farther
deliberation
judged
unnecessary
except
upon
the
most
effectual
means
of
defence
for
this
purpose
the
aged
and
most
experienced
retired
to
a
little
distance
to
consult
they
were
not
long
in
their
deliberations
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
all
who
were
able
to
bear
arms
should
be
embodied
and
wait
for
the
approach
of
the
enemy
within
the
boundaries
of
their
own
mountains
the
nature
of
the
country
always
rough
and
in
many
parts
inaccessible
would
afford
them
they
thought
sufficient
advantages
even
against
the
more
numerous
and
better
disciplined
troops
of
the
invader
and
by
the
common
consent
of
all
sophron
was
named
the
general
of
his
country
and
invested
with
supreme
authority
for
its
defence
when
these
measures
had
been
resolved
upon
the
assembly
dispersed
and
sophron
was
left
alone
with
chares
it
was
then
the
stranger
thus
accosted
him
with
a
deep
sigh
success
o
virtuous
sophron
depend
entirely
upon
the
justice
of
the
cause
or
upon
the
courage
and
zeal
of
its
defenders
i
should
have
little
doubt
concerning
the
event
of
the
present
contest
for
i
can
truly
say
that
in
all
the
various
countries
i
have
visited
my
eyes
have
never
seen
a
more
martial
race
than
i
have
this
day
beheld
assembled
nor
can
i
doubt
that
their
sentiments
correspond
to
their
appearance
all
therefore
that
can
be
effected
by
patience
activity
and
dauntless
courage
will
be
achieved
by
your
countrymen
in
defence
of
their
liberty
but
war
unfortunately
is
a
trade
where
long
experience
frequently
confers
advantages
which
no
intrepidity
can
balance
the
troops
which
are
now
approaching
have
been
for
years
inured
to
the
practice
of
slaughter
they
join
to
a
courage
which
defies
every
danger
a
knowledge
of
every
fraud
and
subtility
which
can
confound
or
baffle
an
adversary
in
bodily
strength
in
numbers
your
countrymen
are
superior
even
in
courage
and
the
contempt
of
danger
they
are
probably
not
inferior
to
their
enemies
but
such
are
the
fatal
effects
of
military
skill
and
discipline
that
i
dread
the
event
of
a
combat
with
such
an
army
and
such
a
leader
answered
sophron
well
do
the
mature
reflections
of
your
wisdom
accord
with
my
presaging
fears
i
know
that
my
countrymen
will
perform
everything
that
can
be
effected
by
men
in
their
situation
and
that
thousands
will
generously
sacrifice
their
lives
rather
than
abandon
the
cause
they
have
undertaken
to
defend
yet
when
i
consider
the
superior
advantage
of
our
enemies
my
fears
are
no
less
active
than
your
own
this
consolation
however
remains
that
i
shall
either
see
my
country
victorious
or
avoid
the
miseries
which
will
attend
her
ruin
me
then
replied
chares
virtues
of
your
friends
my
own
obligations
to
yourself
and
the
desire
i
feel
to
oppose
the
career
of
mad
ambition
conspire
to
wrest
from
me
a
dreadful
secret
which
i
have
hitherto
buried
in
my
own
bosom
and
had
determined
to
conceal
from
the
knowledge
of
mankind
i
have
already
told
you
that
much
of
my
life
has
been
dedicated
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
the
investigation
of
the
laws
of
nature
not
contented
with
viewing
the
appearance
of
things
as
they
strike
our
senses
i
have
endeavoured
to
penetrate
into
the
deeper
recesses
of
nature
and
to
discover
those
secrets
which
are
concealed
from
the
greater
part
of
mankind
for
this
purpose
i
have
tried
innumerable
experiments
concerning
the
manner
in
which
bodies
act
upon
each
other
i
have
submitted
the
plants
the
stones
the
minerals
which
surround
us
to
the
violence
of
fires
i
have
examined
their
structure
and
the
different
principles
which
compose
them
with
the
patient
labour
and
perseverance
of
a
long
life
in
the
course
of
these
inquiries
i
have
made
many
curious
and
important
discoveries
but
one
above
the
rest
which
i
will
now
impart
under
the
promise
of
eternal
and
inviolable
secrecy
know
then
that
i
have
found
out
an
easy
and
expeditious
combination
of
common
materials
the
effect
of
which
is
equal
or
superior
to
the
most
potent
and
destructive
agents
in
nature
neither
the
proudest
city
can
maintain
its
walls
nor
the
strongest
castle
its
bulwarks
against
the
irresistible
attacks
of
this
extraordinary
composition
increase
but
the
quantity
and
the
very
rocks
and
mountains
will
be
torn
asunder
with
a
violence
that
equals
that
of
earthquakes
whole
armies
proud
of
their
triumphs
may
be
in
an
instant
scattered
and
destroyed
like
the
summer
dust
before
the
whirlwind
and
what
increases
the
prodigy
a
single
man
may
securely
give
death
to
thousands
this
composition
i
have
hitherto
concealed
in
pity
to
the
miseries
of
mankind
but
since
there
appears
no
other
method
of
preserving
the
virtuous
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
from
slavery
and
ruin
i
am
determined
to
employ
it
in
their
defence
give
orders
therefore
that
a
certain
number
of
your
countrymen
provide
me
with
the
ingredients
that
i
shall
indicate
and
expect
the
amplest
success
from
your
own
valour
assisted
by
such
powerful
auxiliaries
sophron
said
everything
to
chares
which
such
an
unexpected
mark
of
confidence
deserved
and
instantly
received
his
orders
and
prepared
to
execute
them
with
the
greatest
alacrity
chares
meanwhile
was
indefatigable
in
the
execution
of
his
project
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
prepared
a
sufficient
quantity
to
provide
for
the
common
defence
tigranes
now
approached
with
the
rage
and
confidence
of
a
lion
that
invades
a
flock
of
domestic
animals
he
had
long
forgotten
all
the
ties
which
attach
men
to
the
place
of
their
birth
and
neither
time
nor
distance
had
been
able
to
extinguish
the
hatred
he
had
conceived
to
sophron
scarcely
did
he
deign
to
send
an
ambassador
before
his
army
he
however
despatched
one
with
an
imperious
message
requiring
all
the
inhabitants
of
lebanon
to
submit
to
his
victorious
arms
or
threatening
them
with
the
worst
extremities
of
war
when
the
ambassador
returned
and
reported
the
fixed
determination
of
sophron
and
his
countrymen
he
was
inflamed
with
rage
and
ordered
his
army
to
advance
to
the
attack
they
marched
without
opposition
till
they
entered
the
mountainous
districts
where
all
the
bravest
inhabitants
were
ranged
in
arms
to
meet
the
invader
then
arose
the
noise
of
arms
then
man
encountered
man
and
wounds
and
death
were
seen
on
every
side
the
troops
of
tigranes
advanced
in
close
array
with
long
protended
spears
the
inhabitants
of
lebanon
were
more
lightly
armed
and
with
invincible
courage
endeavoured
to
break
the
formidable
battalion
of
their
enemies
they
rushed
with
fury
upon
the
dreadful
range
of
weapons
and
even
wounded
and
dying
endeavoured
to
beat
down
their
points
and
open
a
way
to
their
companions
sophron
was
seen
conspicuous
in
every
part
of
the
field
encouraging
his
companions
with
his
voice
and
more
by
his
actions
wherever
he
turned
his
steps
he
was
followed
by
the
bravest
youth
of
his
party
and
there
the
efforts
and
the
slaughter
were
always
greatest
five
times
covered
with
blood
and
dust
he
made
a
desperate
charge
upon
the
troops
of
tigranes
and
five
times
did
he
force
his
bravest
soldiers
to
give
ground
at
length
the
superiority
of
discipline
and
experience
began
to
prevail
over
the
generous
but
more
unequal
efforts
of
the
defenders
the
veterans
of
tigranes
perceived
their
advantage
and
pressed
the
enemy
with
redoubled
vigour
this
was
the
decisive
moment
which
chares
had
foreseen
and
provided
for
in
an
instant
the
bands
of
lebanon
retreated
by
the
orders
of
sophron
with
a
precipitation
bordering
upon
flight
tigranes
supposing
himself
certain
of
victory
orders
his
troops
to
advance
and
decide
the
fortune
of
the
battle
but
while
they
are
rashly
preparing
to
obey
a
sudden
noise
is
heard
that
equals
the
loudest
thunders
the
earth
itself
trembles
with
a
convulsive
motion
under
their
feet
then
bursts
asunder
with
a
violence
that
nothing
can
resist
hundreds
are
in
an
instant
swallowed
up
or
dashed
against
rocks
and
miserably
destroyed
meanwhile
all
nature
seems
to
be
convulsed
around
the
rocks
themselves
are
torn
from
their
solid
base
and
with
their
enormous
fragments
crush
whole
bands
of
miserable
wretches
beneath
clouds
of
smoke
obscure
the
field
of
battle
and
veil
the
combatants
in
a
dreadful
shade
which
is
from
time
to
time
dispelled
by
flashes
of
destructive
fire
such
a
succession
of
horrors
daunted
even
the
most
brave
scarcely
could
the
troops
of
lebanon
who
had
been
prepared
to
expect
some
extraordinary
interposition
maintain
their
post
or
behold
the
spectacle
of
their
enemy
ruin
but
the
bands
of
tigranes
were
struck
with
the
wildest
consternation
and
fled
with
trembling
steps
over
the
field
and
now
these
prodigies
were
succeeded
by
an
awful
interval
of
quiet
the
peals
of
bursting
thunder
were
no
longer
heard
the
lightnings
ceased
to
flash
the
mists
that
darkened
the
scene
were
rolled
away
and
discovered
the
various
fortunes
of
the
fight
when
the
voice
of
sophron
was
heard
exhorting
his
companions
to
pursue
the
fugitives
and
complete
their
victory
they
rushed
forward
like
angry
lions
to
the
chase
but
all
resistance
was
at
an
end
and
sophron
who
now
perceived
that
the
enemy
was
irretrievably
broken
checked
the
ardour
of
his
men
and
entreated
them
to
spare
the
vanquished
they
obeyed
his
voice
and
after
having
chased
them
beyond
the
utmost
boundaries
of
lebanon
returned
in
triumph
amid
the
praises
and
acclamations
of
their
joyful
families
whom
they
had
preserved
from
slavery
by
their
valour
they
then
examined
the
field
of
battle
and
collecting
all
who
had
any
remains
of
life
they
treated
them
with
the
greatest
humanity
binding
up
their
wounds
and
administering
to
all
their
necessities
among
the
thickest
dead
was
found
the
breathless
body
of
tigranes
miserably
shattered
and
disfigured
but
still
exhibiting
evident
marks
of
passion
and
ferocity
sophron
could
not
behold
without
compassion
the
friend
of
his
early
years
and
the
companion
of
his
youthful
sports
man
said
he
hast
at
length
paid
the
price
of
thy
ungovernable
ambition
how
much
better
would
it
have
been
to
have
tended
thy
flocks
upon
the
mountains
than
to
have
blazed
an
angry
meteor
and
set
for
ever
amid
the
curses
of
thy
country
he
then
covered
the
body
with
a
military
vest
and
ordered
it
to
be
honourably
burned
upon
a
mighty
which
was
prepared
for
all
the
dead
the
next
day
an
immense
quantity
of
spoil
was
collected
that
had
been
abandoned
by
the
troops
of
tigranes
in
their
flight
the
simple
inhabitants
of
lebanon
the
greater
part
of
whom
had
never
been
beyond
the
limits
of
their
mountains
were
astonished
at
such
a
display
of
luxury
and
magnificence
already
the
secret
poison
of
sensuality
and
avarice
began
to
inflame
their
hearts
as
they
gazed
on
costly
hangings
enriched
with
gold
and
silver
on
persian
carpets
and
of
the
most
exquisite
workmanship
already
had
they
begun
to
differ
about
the
division
of
these
splendid
trifles
when
sophron
who
marked
the
growing
mischief
and
remembered
the
fatal
effects
which
chares
had
described
in
his
travels
rose
and
proposed
to
his
countrymen
that
the
arms
of
their
conquered
enemies
should
be
carefully
preserved
for
the
public
defence
but
that
all
the
rest
of
the
spoil
should
be
consumed
upon
the
prepared
for
the
dead
lest
the
simplicity
of
the
inhabitants
of
lebanon
should
be
corrupted
and
the
happy
equality
and
union
which
had
hitherto
prevailed
among
them
be
interrupted
this
proposal
was
instantly
applauded
by
all
the
older
and
wiser
part
of
the
assembly
who
rejoiced
in
seeing
the
evils
averted
which
they
had
so
much
reason
to
apprehend
nor
did
those
of
a
different
character
dare
to
express
their
sentiments
or
attempt
any
open
opposition
from
this
time
sophron
was
universally
honoured
by
all
as
the
most
virtuous
and
valiant
of
his
nation
he
passed
the
rest
of
his
life
in
peace
and
tranquillity
contented
with
the
exercise
of
the
same
rural
employments
which
had
engaged
his
childhood
chares
whose
virtues
and
knowledge
were
equally
admirable
was
presented
at
the
public
expense
with
a
small
but
fertile
tract
of
land
sufficient
to
supply
him
with
all
the
comforts
of
life
this
the
grateful
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
continually
cultivated
for
him
as
a
memorial
of
the
signal
assistance
he
had
afforded
them
and
here
contented
with
the
enjoyment
of
security
and
freedom
he
passed
the
remaining
part
of
his
life
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
and
the
delightful
intercourse
of
virtuous
friendship
when
miss
simmons
had
finished
tommy
expressed
his
astonishment
at
the
latter
part
of
the
story
is
it
possible
said
he
there
can
be
anything
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
as
to
burst
the
very
rocks
asunder
and
destroy
an
army
at
once
have
you
then
never
heard
the
explosion
of
a
gun
or
are
you
ignorant
of
the
destructive
effects
of
the
powder
with
which
they
charge
it
said
mr
barlow
yes
sir
but
that
is
nothing
to
what
chares
did
in
the
story
that
is
only
because
it
is
used
in
very
inconsiderable
portions
but
were
you
to
increase
the
quantity
it
would
be
capable
of
effecting
everything
which
you
heard
miss
simmons
describe
when
nations
are
at
war
with
each
other
it
is
now
universally
the
agent
of
destruction
they
have
large
tubes
of
iron
called
into
which
they
ram
a
considerable
quantity
of
powder
together
with
a
large
iron
ball
as
big
as
you
are
able
to
lift
they
then
set
fire
to
the
powder
which
explodes
with
so
much
violence
that
the
ball
flies
out
and
destroys
not
only
every
living
thing
it
meets
with
but
even
demolishes
the
strongest
walls
that
can
be
raised
sometimes
it
is
buried
in
considerable
quantities
in
the
earth
and
then
they
contrive
to
inflame
it
and
to
escape
in
time
when
the
fire
communicates
with
the
mass
it
is
all
inflamed
in
an
instant
and
produces
the
horrible
effects
you
have
heard
described
as
such
are
the
irresistible
effects
of
gunpowder
it
is
no
wonder
that
even
a
victorious
army
should
be
stopped
in
their
progress
by
such
a
dreadful
and
unexpected
event
that
is
true
indeed
and
i
declare
chares
was
a
very
good
and
sensible
man
had
it
not
been
for
him
these
brave
inhabitants
of
lebanon
must
have
been
enslaved
i
now
plainly
perceive
that
a
man
may
be
of
much
more
consequence
by
improving
his
mind
in
various
kinds
of
knowledge
even
though
he
is
poor
than
by
all
the
finery
and
magnificence
he
can
acquire
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
mr
barlow
had
been
so
good
as
to
read
this
story
to
the
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
that
were
lately
here
i
think
it
would
have
made
a
great
impression
upon
their
minds
and
would
have
prevented
their
feeling
so
much
contempt
for
poor
harry
who
is
better
and
wiser
than
them
all
though
he
does
not
powder
his
hair
or
dress
so
genteelly
tommy
said
mr
merton
with
a
kind
of
contemptuous
smile
why
should
you
believe
that
the
hearing
of
a
single
story
would
change
the
characters
of
all
your
late
friends
when
neither
the
good
instructions
you
have
been
so
long
receiving
from
mr
barlow
nor
the
intimacy
you
have
had
with
harry
were
sufficient
to
restrain
your
impetuous
temper
or
prevent
you
from
treating
him
in
the
shameful
manner
you
have
done
tommy
appeared
very
much
abashed
with
his
father
rebuke
he
hung
down
his
head
in
silence
a
considerable
time
at
length
he
faintly
said
oh
sir
i
have
indeed
acted
very
ill
i
have
rendered
myself
unworthy
the
affection
of
all
my
best
friends
but
do
not
pray
do
not
give
me
up
entirely
you
shall
see
how
i
will
behave
for
the
future
and
if
ever
i
am
guilty
of
the
same
faults
again
i
consent
that
you
shall
abandon
me
for
ever
saying
this
he
silently
stole
out
of
the
room
as
if
intent
upon
some
extraordinary
resolution
his
father
observed
his
motions
and
smiling
said
to
mr
barlow
what
can
this
portend
this
boy
is
changeable
as
a
weathercock
every
blast
whirls
him
round
and
round
upon
his
centre
nor
will
he
ever
fix
i
fear
in
any
direction
at
least
replied
mr
barlow
you
have
the
greatest
reason
to
rejoice
in
his
present
impressions
which
are
good
and
estimable
and
i
fear
it
is
the
lot
of
most
human
beings
to
exhaust
almost
every
species
of
error
before
they
fix
in
truth
and
virtue
tommy
now
entered
the
room
but
with
a
remarkable
change
in
his
dress
and
manner
he
had
combed
the
powder
out
of
his
hair
and
demolished
the
elegance
of
his
curls
he
had
divested
his
dress
of
every
appearance
of
finery
and
even
his
massy
and
ponderous
buckles
so
long
the
delight
of
his
heart
and
the
wonder
of
his
female
friends
were
taken
from
his
shoes
and
replaced
by
a
pair
of
the
plainest
form
and
appearance
in
this
habiliment
he
appeared
so
totally
changed
from
what
he
was
that
even
his
mother
who
had
lately
become
a
little
sparing
of
her
observations
could
not
help
exclaiming
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
has
the
boy
been
doing
now
why
tommy
i
protest
you
have
made
yourself
a
perfect
fright
and
you
look
more
like
a
ploughboy
than
a
young
gentleman
mamma
answered
tommy
gravely
i
am
now
only
what
i
ought
always
to
have
been
had
i
been
contented
with
this
dress
before
i
never
should
have
imitated
such
a
parcel
of
coxcombs
as
you
have
lately
had
at
your
house
nor
pretended
to
admire
miss
matilda
music
which
i
own
tired
me
as
much
as
harry
and
had
almost
set
me
asleep
nor
should
i
have
exposed
myself
at
the
play
and
the
ball
and
what
is
worst
of
all
i
should
have
avoided
all
my
shameful
behaviour
to
harry
at
the
but
from
this
time
i
shall
apply
myself
to
the
study
of
nothing
but
reason
and
philosophy
and
therefore
i
have
bid
adieu
to
dress
and
finery
for
ever
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
the
gentlemen
could
refrain
from
laughing
at
tommy
harangue
delivered
with
infinite
seriousness
and
solemnity
they
however
concealed
their
emotions
and
encouraged
him
to
persevere
in
such
a
laudable
resolution
but
as
the
night
was
now
pretty
far
advanced
the
whole
family
retired
to
bed
the
next
morning
early
tommy
arose
and
dressed
himself
with
his
simplicity
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
prevailed
with
mr
barlow
to
accompany
him
to
harry
sandford
but
he
did
not
forget
to
take
with
him
the
lamb
which
he
had
caressed
and
fed
with
constant
assiduity
ever
since
he
had
so
valiantly
rescued
him
from
his
devouring
enemy
as
they
approached
the
house
the
first
object
which
tommy
distinguished
was
his
little
friend
at
some
distance
who
was
driving
his
father
sheep
along
the
common
at
this
sight
his
impetuosity
could
no
longer
be
restrained
and
springing
forward
with
all
his
speed
he
arrived
in
an
instant
panting
and
out
of
breath
and
incapable
of
speaking
harry
who
knew
his
friend
and
plainly
perceived
the
disposition
with
which
he
approached
met
him
with
open
arms
so
that
the
reconciliation
was
begun
and
completed
in
a
moment
and
mr
barlow
who
now
arrived
with
the
lamb
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
little
pupils
mutually
giving
and
receiving
every
unaffected
mark
of
the
warmest
affection
harry
said
mr
barlow
i
bring
you
a
little
friend
who
is
sincerely
penitent
for
his
offences
and
comes
to
own
the
faults
he
has
committed
that
i
am
indeed
said
tommy
a
little
recovered
and
able
to
speak
but
i
have
behaved
so
ill
and
been
such
an
ungrateful
fellow
that
i
am
afraid
harry
will
never
be
able
to
forgive
me
indeed
indeed
said
harry
there
you
do
me
the
greatest
injustice
for
i
have
already
forgotten
everything
but
your
former
kindness
and
affection
and
i
answered
tommy
will
never
forget
how
ill
how
ungratefully
i
have
used
you
nor
the
goodness
with
which
you
now
receive
me
tommy
then
recollected
his
lamb
and
presented
it
to
his
friend
while
mr
barlow
told
him
the
story
of
its
rescue
and
the
heroism
exerted
in
its
defence
harry
seemed
to
receive
equal
pleasure
from
the
restoration
of
his
favourite
and
the
affection
tommy
had
shown
in
its
preservation
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
he
led
him
into
a
small
but
neat
and
convenient
house
where
he
was
most
cordially
welcomed
by
harry
family
in
a
corner
of
the
chimney
sat
the
honest
black
who
had
performed
so
signal
a
service
at
the
alas
said
tommy
there
is
another
instance
of
my
negligence
and
ingratitude
i
now
see
that
one
fault
brings
on
another
without
end
then
advancing
to
the
black
he
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
and
thanked
him
for
the
preservation
of
his
life
little
master
replied
he
you
are
extremely
welcome
to
all
i
have
done
i
would
at
any
time
risk
my
own
safety
to
preserve
one
of
my
and
if
i
have
been
of
any
use
i
have
been
amply
repaid
by
the
kindness
of
this
little
boy
your
friend
and
all
his
worthy
family
that
is
not
enough
said
tommy
and
you
shall
soon
find
what
it
is
to
oblige
a
person
like
here
a
stroke
of
presumption
was
just
coming
out
of
tommy
mouth
but
recollecting
himself
he
added
a
person
like
my
father
and
now
he
addressed
himself
to
mother
a
venerable
decent
woman
of
middle
age
and
his
two
sisters
plain
modest
girls
a
little
older
than
their
brother
all
these
he
treated
with
so
much
cordiality
and
attention
that
all
the
company
were
delighted
with
him
so
easy
is
it
for
those
who
possess
rank
and
fortune
to
gain
the
goodwill
of
their
and
so
inexcusable
is
that
surly
pride
which
renders
many
of
them
deservedly
odious
when
dinner
was
ready
he
sat
down
with
the
rest
and
as
it
was
the
custom
here
for
everybody
to
wait
upon
himself
tommy
insisted
upon
their
suffering
him
to
conform
to
the
established
method
the
food
indeed
was
not
very
delicate
but
it
was
wholesome
clean
and
served
up
hot
to
table
an
advantage
which
is
not
always
found
in
elegant
apartments
tommy
ate
with
a
considerable
appetite
and
seemed
to
enjoy
his
new
situation
as
much
as
if
he
had
never
experienced
any
other
after
the
dinner
was
removed
he
thought
he
might
with
propriety
gratify
the
curiosity
he
felt
to
converse
with
the
black
upon
fighting
bulls
for
nothing
had
more
astonished
him
than
the
account
he
had
heard
of
his
courage
and
the
ease
with
which
he
had
subdued
so
terrible
an
animal
my
friend
said
he
i
suppose
in
your
own
country
you
have
been
very
much
used
to
otherwise
you
would
never
have
dared
to
encounter
such
a
fierce
creature
i
must
confess
though
i
can
tame
most
animals
i
never
was
more
frightened
in
my
life
than
when
i
saw
him
break
loose
and
without
your
assistance
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
master
replied
the
black
it
is
not
in
my
own
country
that
i
have
learned
to
manage
these
animals
there
i
have
been
accustomed
to
several
kinds
of
hunting
much
more
dangerous
than
this
and
considering
how
much
you
white
people
despise
us
blacks
i
own
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
so
many
hundreds
of
you
running
away
from
such
an
insignificant
enemy
as
a
poor
tame
bull
tommy
blushed
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
the
prejudices
he
had
formerly
entertained
concerning
blacks
and
his
own
superiority
but
not
choosing
now
to
enter
upon
the
subject
he
asked
the
man
where
then
he
had
acquired
so
much
dexterity
in
taming
them
i
will
tell
you
master
replied
the
black
when
i
lived
a
slave
among
the
spaniards
at
buenos
ayres
it
used
to
be
a
common
employment
of
the
people
to
go
into
the
woods
to
hunt
cattle
down
for
their
subsistence
the
hunter
mounts
his
fleetest
horse
and
takes
with
him
a
strong
cord
of
a
considerable
length
when
he
sees
one
of
the
wild
kind
which
he
destines
for
his
prey
he
pursues
it
at
full
speed
and
never
fails
to
overtake
it
by
the
superior
swiftness
of
his
horse
while
he
is
thus
employed
he
holds
the
cord
ready
at
the
end
of
which
a
sliding
noose
is
formed
and
when
he
is
at
a
convenient
distance
throws
it
from
him
with
such
a
certain
hand
that
the
beast
is
entangled
by
one
of
his
legs
after
which
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
escape
that
you
may
form
a
more
clear
idea
of
what
a
man
is
capable
of
executing
with
courage
and
address
i
will
relate
a
most
extraordinary
incident
to
which
i
was
witness
during
my
residence
in
that
part
of
the
world
a
certain
man
a
native
of
the
country
had
committed
some
offence
for
which
he
was
condemned
to
labour
several
years
in
the
galleys
he
found
means
to
speak
to
the
governor
of
the
town
and
besought
him
to
change
the
nature
of
his
punishment
have
been
brought
up
said
he
warrior
and
fear
dishonour
but
not
death
instead
of
consuming
my
strength
and
spirits
in
such
an
ignominious
employment
let
me
have
an
opportunity
of
achieving
something
worthy
to
be
beheld
or
of
perishing
like
a
brave
man
in
the
attempt
in
a
few
days
a
solemn
feast
is
to
be
celebrated
at
which
you
will
not
fail
to
be
present
attended
by
all
your
people
i
will
there
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
city
encounter
the
fiercest
bull
you
can
procure
i
desire
no
assistance
but
my
horse
no
weapons
but
this
cord
yet
thus
prepared
i
will
meet
his
fury
and
take
him
by
the
head
the
horns
the
feet
as
you
shall
direct
i
will
then
throw
him
down
bridle
him
saddle
him
and
vault
upon
his
back
in
this
situation
you
shall
turn
out
two
more
of
the
fiercest
bulls
you
can
find
and
i
will
attack
them
both
and
put
them
all
to
death
with
my
dagger
the
instant
you
shall
command
the
governor
consented
to
this
brave
man
request
more
from
curiosity
to
see
so
extraordinary
a
spectacle
than
from
the
opinion
it
would
be
attended
with
success
when
the
appointed
day
arrived
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
assembled
and
took
their
seats
in
a
vast
building
which
surrounded
a
considerable
open
space
destined
for
this
amazing
combat
the
brave
american
then
appeared
alone
on
horseback
armed
with
nothing
but
his
cord
and
after
riding
round
the
place
and
saluting
the
company
he
waited
intrepidly
for
his
enemy
presently
an
enormous
bull
was
let
loose
who
as
soon
as
he
beheld
the
man
attacked
him
with
all
his
fury
the
american
avoided
his
shock
with
infinite
dexterity
and
galloped
round
the
bull
who
in
his
turn
betook
himself
to
flight
the
valiant
horseman
pursued
his
flying
enemy
and
while
he
was
thus
engaged
he
desired
the
governor
to
direct
where
he
would
have
him
seized
he
replied
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
and
the
american
instantly
throwing
his
noose
which
he
held
ready
all
the
time
caught
the
bull
in
his
flight
by
one
of
his
hinder
legs
then
galloping
two
or
three
times
round
the
animal
he
so
enveloped
him
in
the
snare
that
after
a
few
violent
efforts
to
disengage
himself
he
fell
to
the
earth
he
then
leaped
lightly
from
his
horse
and
the
animal
who
had
been
perfectly
trained
up
to
this
kind
of
combat
stood
still
and
kept
the
cord
extended
while
his
master
advanced
to
the
bull
and
put
him
to
death
in
an
instant
by
stabbing
him
with
his
dagger
behind
the
horns
all
the
assembly
uttered
a
shout
of
admiration
but
the
conqueror
told
them
that
what
they
had
seen
was
nothing
and
disentangling
his
cord
from
the
slaughtered
beast
he
composedly
mounted
his
horse
and
waited
for
a
new
and
more
formidable
enemy
presently
the
gate
of
the
torillo
was
opened
and
a
bull
much
more
furious
than
the
last
rushed
out
whom
he
was
ordered
to
bridle
and
saddle
according
to
his
engagement
i
protest
said
tommy
this
is
the
most
wonderful
story
i
ever
heard
i
do
not
believe
all
the
fine
gentleman
i
have
ever
seen
put
together
would
dare
to
attack
such
a
bull
master
replied
the
black
the
talents
of
mankind
are
various
and
nature
has
in
every
country
furnished
the
human
species
with
all
the
qualities
necessary
for
their
preservation
in
this
country
and
many
others
which
i
have
seen
there
are
thousands
who
live
like
birds
in
cages
upon
the
food
provided
by
others
without
doing
anything
for
themselves
but
they
should
be
contented
with
the
happiness
they
enjoy
if
such
a
life
can
be
called
happiness
and
not
despise
their
without
whose
continual
assistance
they
could
not
exist
an
instant
very
true
indeed
answered
tommy
you
seem
to
be
a
very
honest
sensible
man
though
a
negro
and
since
i
have
given
myself
up
to
the
improvement
of
my
mind
i
entertain
the
same
opinions
but
let
us
hear
how
this
brave
man
succeeded
in
his
next
attempt
when
the
champion
perceived
this
second
enemy
approach
he
waited
for
him
with
the
same
intrepidity
he
had
discovered
before
and
avoided
his
formidable
shock
by
making
his
horse
wheel
nimbly
round
the
bull
when
he
had
thus
baffled
his
fury
and
put
his
enemy
to
flight
he
chased
him
some
time
as
he
had
done
the
former
till
he
drove
him
near
to
the
middle
of
the
enclosed
space
where
a
strong
post
had
been
firmly
fixed
into
the
ground
as
soon
as
he
approached
the
spot
he
threw
the
unerring
noose
and
catching
the
bull
by
the
horns
entangled
him
as
he
had
done
before
and
dragged
him
with
some
difficulty
to
the
stake
to
this
he
bound
him
down
so
closely
that
it
became
impossible
for
the
creature
either
to
resist
or
stir
leaping
then
from
his
horse
who
remained
immovable
as
before
he
took
a
saddle
which
had
been
left
there
on
purpose
and
girded
it
firmly
on
the
back
of
the
bull
through
his
nostrils
he
thrust
an
iron
ring
to
which
was
fixed
a
cord
which
he
brought
over
his
neck
as
a
bridle
and
then
arming
his
hand
with
a
short
spike
he
nimbly
vaulted
upon
the
back
of
this
new
and
terrible
courser
the
creature
all
this
time
did
not
cease
to
bellow
with
every
expression
of
rage
which
had
not
the
least
effect
upon
the
mind
of
this
valiant
man
on
the
contrary
coolly
taking
a
knife
he
cut
the
cord
which
bound
him
to
the
stake
and
restored
him
to
perfect
liberty
the
creature
thus
disengaged
exerted
every
effort
of
strength
and
fury
to
throw
his
rider
who
kept
his
seat
undaunted
in
spite
of
all
his
violent
agitation
the
gates
of
the
torillo
were
then
thrown
open
and
two
other
furious
bulls
rushed
out
and
seemed
ready
to
attack
the
man
but
at
the
instant
they
perceived
the
manner
in
which
he
was
mounted
their
rage
gave
way
to
terror
and
they
fled
precipitately
away
the
other
bull
followed
his
companions
and
bore
his
rider
several
times
round
the
amphitheatre
in
this
extraordinary
chase
this
spectacle
had
already
lasted
some
time
to
the
admiration
of
all
present
when
the
governor
ordered
the
man
to
complete
the
business
by
putting
all
the
bulls
to
death
he
instantly
drawing
his
knife
plunged
it
behind
the
horns
of
the
bull
on
which
he
rode
who
immediately
dropped
down
dead
while
the
conqueror
disengaging
himself
as
he
fell
stood
upright
by
the
slaughtered
animal
he
then
mounted
his
horse
again
who
had
been
placed
in
safety
at
some
little
distance
and
pursuing
the
chase
as
before
with
his
fatal
noose
despatched
both
the
surviving
animals
without
the
least
difficulty
tommy
expressed
the
greatest
admiration
at
this
recital
and
now
as
the
evening
began
to
advance
mr
barlow
invited
him
to
return
but
tommy
instead
of
complying
took
him
by
the
hand
thanked
him
for
all
his
kindness
and
attention
but
declared
his
resolution
of
staying
some
time
with
his
friend
harry
the
more
i
consider
my
own
behaviour
said
he
the
more
i
feel
myself
ashamed
of
my
folly
and
ingratitude
but
you
have
taught
me
my
dear
sir
that
all
i
have
in
my
power
is
to
acknowledge
them
which
i
most
willingly
do
before
all
this
good
family
and
entreat
harry
to
think
that
the
impressions
i
now
feel
are
such
as
i
shall
never
forget
harry
embraced
his
friend
and
assured
him
once
more
of
his
being
perfectly
reconciled
and
all
the
family
stood
mute
with
admiration
at
the
condescension
of
the
young
gentleman
who
was
not
ashamed
of
acknowledging
his
faults
even
to
his
inferiors
mr
barlow
approved
of
tommy
design
and
took
upon
him
to
answer
for
the
consent
of
mr
merton
to
his
staying
some
time
with
harry
then
taking
his
leave
of
all
the
company
he
departed
but
tommy
began
now
to
enter
upon
a
course
of
life
which
was
very
little
consistent
with
his
former
habits
he
supped
with
great
cheerfulness
and
even
found
himself
happy
with
the
rustic
fare
which
was
set
before
him
accompanied
as
it
was
with
unaffected
civility
and
a
hearty
welcome
he
went
to
bed
early
and
slept
very
soundly
all
night
however
when
harry
came
to
call
him
the
next
morning
at
five
as
he
had
made
him
promise
to
do
he
found
a
considerable
difficulty
in
rousing
himself
at
the
summons
conscious
pride
however
and
the
dignity
of
his
character
supported
him
he
recollected
that
he
should
disgrace
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
father
of
mr
barlow
and
of
all
the
family
with
which
he
now
was
if
he
appeared
incapable
of
acting
up
to
his
own
declarations
he
therefore
made
a
noble
effort
leaped
out
of
bed
dressed
himself
and
followed
harry
not
contented
with
this
he
accompanied
him
in
all
his
rustic
employments
and
as
no
kind
of
country
exercise
was
entirely
new
to
him
since
his
residence
with
mr
barlow
he
acquitted
himself
with
a
degree
of
dexterity
that
gained
him
new
commendations
thus
did
he
pass
the
first
day
of
his
visit
with
some
little
difficulty
indeed
but
without
deviating
from
his
resolution
the
second
he
found
his
change
of
life
infinitely
more
tolerable
and
in
a
very
little
space
of
time
he
was
almost
reconciled
to
his
new
situation
the
additional
exercise
he
used
improved
his
health
and
strength
and
added
so
considerably
to
his
appetite
that
he
began
to
think
the
table
of
farmer
sandford
exceeded
all
that
he
had
ever
tried
before
by
thus
practising
the
common
useful
occupations
of
life
he
began
to
feel
a
more
tender
interest
in
the
common
concerns
of
his
he
now
found
from
his
own
experience
that
mr
barlow
had
not
deceived
him
in
the
various
representations
he
had
made
of
the
utility
of
the
lower
classes
and
consequently
of
the
humanity
which
is
due
to
them
when
they
discharge
their
duty
nor
did
that
gentleman
abandon
his
little
friend
in
this
important
trial
he
visited
him
frequently
pointed
out
everything
that
was
curious
or
interesting
about
the
farm
and
encouraged
him
to
persevere
by
his
praises
you
are
now
said
mr
barlow
one
day
beginning
to
practise
those
virtues
which
have
rendered
the
great
men
of
other
times
so
justly
famous
it
is
not
by
sloth
nor
finery
nor
the
mean
indulgence
of
our
appetites
that
greatness
of
character
or
even
reputation
is
to
be
acquired
he
that
would
excel
others
in
virtue
or
knowledge
must
first
excel
them
in
temperance
and
application
you
can
not
imagine
that
men
fit
to
command
an
army
or
to
give
laws
to
a
state
were
ever
formed
by
an
idle
and
effeminate
education
when
the
roman
people
oppressed
by
their
enemies
were
looking
out
for
a
leader
able
to
defend
them
and
change
the
fortune
of
the
war
where
did
they
seek
for
this
extraordinary
man
it
was
neither
at
banquets
nor
in
splendid
palaces
nor
amid
the
gay
the
elegant
or
the
dissipated
they
turned
their
steps
towards
a
poor
and
solitary
cottage
such
as
the
meanest
of
your
late
companions
would
consider
with
contempt
there
they
found
whose
virtues
and
abilities
were
allowed
to
excel
all
the
rest
of
his
citizens
turning
up
the
soil
with
a
pair
of
oxen
and
holding
the
plough
himself
this
great
man
had
been
inured
to
arms
and
the
management
of
public
affairs
even
from
his
infancy
he
had
repeatedly
led
the
roman
legions
to
victory
yet
in
the
hour
of
peace
or
when
his
country
did
not
require
his
services
he
deemed
no
employment
more
honourable
than
to
labour
for
his
own
subsistence
what
would
all
your
late
friends
have
said
to
see
the
greatest
men
in
england
and
the
bravest
officers
of
the
army
crowding
round
the
house
of
one
of
those
obscure
farmers
you
have
been
accustomed
to
despise
and
entreating
him
in
the
most
respectful
language
to
leave
his
fields
and
accept
of
the
highest
dignity
in
the
government
or
army
yet
this
was
actually
the
state
of
things
at
rome
and
it
was
characters
like
these
with
all
the
train
of
severe
and
rugged
virtues
which
elevated
that
people
above
all
the
other
nations
of
the
world
and
tell
me
my
little
friend
since
chance
not
merit
too
frequently
allots
the
situation
in
which
men
are
to
act
had
you
rather
in
a
high
station
appear
to
all
mankind
unworthy
of
the
advantages
you
enjoy
or
in
a
low
one
seem
equal
to
the
most
exalted
employments
by
your
virtues
and
abilities
such
were
the
conversations
which
mr
barlow
frequently
held
with
tommy
and
which
never
failed
to
inspire
him
with
new
resolution
to
persevere
nor
could
he
help
being
frequently
affected
by
the
comparison
of
behaviour
with
his
own
no
cloud
seemed
ever
to
shade
the
features
of
his
friend
or
alter
the
uniform
sweetness
of
his
temper
even
the
repeated
provocations
he
had
received
were
either
totally
obliterated
or
had
made
no
disagreeable
impressions
after
discharging
the
necessary
duties
of
the
day
he
gave
up
the
rest
of
his
time
to
the
amusement
of
tommy
with
so
much
zeal
and
affection
that
he
could
not
help
loving
him
a
thousand
times
better
than
before
during
the
evening
too
tommy
frequently
conversed
with
the
honest
negro
concerning
the
most
remarkable
circumstances
of
the
country
where
he
was
born
one
night
that
he
seemed
peculiarly
inquisitive
the
black
gave
him
the
following
account
of
himself
i
was
born
said
he
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
river
gambia
in
africa
in
country
people
are
astonished
at
my
colour
and
start
at
the
sight
of
a
black
man
as
if
he
did
not
belong
to
their
species
but
everybody
resembles
me
and
when
the
first
white
men
landed
upon
our
coast
we
were
as
much
surprised
with
their
appearance
as
you
can
be
with
ours
in
some
parts
of
the
world
i
have
seen
men
of
a
yellow
hue
in
others
of
a
copper
colour
and
all
have
the
foolish
vanity
to
despise
their
as
infinitely
inferior
to
themselves
there
indeed
they
entertain
these
conceits
from
ignorance
but
in
this
country
where
the
natives
pretend
to
superior
reason
i
have
often
wondered
they
could
be
influenced
by
such
a
prejudice
is
a
black
horse
thought
to
be
inferior
to
a
white
one
in
speed
in
strength
or
courage
is
a
white
cow
thought
to
give
more
milk
or
a
white
dog
to
have
a
more
acute
scent
in
pursuing
the
game
on
the
contrary
i
have
generally
found
in
almost
every
country
that
a
pale
colour
in
animals
is
considered
as
a
mark
of
weakness
and
inferiority
why
then
should
a
certain
race
of
men
imagine
themselves
superior
to
the
rest
for
the
very
circumstance
they
despise
in
other
animals
but
in
the
country
where
i
was
born
it
is
not
only
that
differs
from
what
we
see
here
but
every
other
circumstance
for
a
considerable
part
of
the
year
you
are
chilled
by
frosts
and
snows
and
scarcely
behold
the
presence
of
the
sun
during
that
gloomy
season
which
is
called
the
winter
with
us
the
sun
is
always
present
pouring
out
light
and
heat
and
scorching
us
with
his
fiercest
beams
in
my
country
we
know
no
difference
between
the
length
of
nights
and
days
all
are
of
equal
length
throughout
the
year
and
present
not
that
continual
variety
which
you
see
here
we
have
neither
ice
nor
frost
nor
snow
the
trees
never
lose
their
leaves
and
we
have
fruits
in
every
season
of
the
year
during
several
months
indeed
we
are
scorched
by
unremitting
heats
which
parch
the
ground
dry
up
the
rivers
and
afflict
both
men
and
animals
with
intolerable
thirst
in
that
season
you
may
behold
lions
tigers
elephants
and
a
variety
of
other
ferocious
animals
driven
from
their
dark
abodes
in
the
midst
of
impenetrable
forests
down
to
the
lower
grounds
and
the
sides
of
rivers
every
night
we
hear
their
savage
yells
their
cries
of
rage
and
think
ourselves
scarcely
safe
in
our
cottages
in
this
country
you
have
reduced
all
other
animals
to
subjection
and
have
nothing
to
fear
except
from
each
other
you
even
shelter
yourselves
from
the
injuries
of
the
weather
in
mansions
that
seem
calculated
to
last
for
ever
in
impenetrable
houses
of
brick
and
stone
that
would
have
scarcely
anything
to
fear
from
the
whole
animal
creation
but
with
us
a
few
reeds
twisted
together
and
perhaps
daubed
over
with
slime
or
mud
compose
the
whole
of
our
dwelling
yet
the
innocent
negro
would
sleep
as
happy
and
contented
as
you
do
in
your
palaces
provided
you
do
not
drag
him
by
fraud
and
violence
away
and
force
him
to
endure
all
the
excesses
of
your
cruelty
it
was
in
one
of
these
cottages
that
i
first
remembered
anything
of
myself
a
few
stakes
set
in
the
ground
and
interwoven
with
dry
leaves
covered
at
top
with
the
spreading
leaves
of
the
palm
composed
our
dwelling
our
furniture
consisted
of
three
or
four
earthen
pipkins
in
which
our
food
was
dressed
a
few
mats
woven
with
a
silky
kind
of
grass
to
serve
as
beds
the
instruments
with
which
my
mother
turned
the
ground
and
the
javelin
arrows
and
lines
which
my
father
used
in
fishing
or
the
chase
in
this
country
and
many
others
where
i
have
been
i
observe
that
nobody
thinks
himself
happy
till
he
has
got
together
a
thousand
things
which
he
does
not
want
and
can
never
use
you
live
in
houses
so
big
that
they
are
fit
to
contain
an
army
you
cover
yourselves
with
superfluous
clothes
that
restrain
all
the
motions
of
your
bodies
when
you
want
to
eat
you
must
have
meat
enough
served
up
to
nourish
a
whole
village
yet
i
have
seen
poor
famished
wretches
starving
at
your
gate
while
the
master
had
before
him
at
least
a
hundred
times
as
much
as
he
could
consume
we
negroes
whom
you
treat
as
savages
have
different
manners
and
different
opinions
the
first
thing
that
i
can
remember
of
myself
was
the
running
naked
about
such
a
cottage
as
i
have
described
with
four
of
my
little
brothers
and
sisters
i
have
observed
your
children
here
with
astonishment
as
soon
as
they
are
born
it
seems
to
be
the
business
of
all
about
them
to
render
them
weak
helpless
and
unable
to
use
any
of
their
limbs
the
little
negro
on
the
contrary
is
scarcely
born
before
he
learns
to
crawl
about
upon
the
ground
unrestrained
by
bandages
or
ligatures
he
comes
as
soon
and
as
easily
to
the
perfect
use
of
all
his
organs
as
any
of
the
beasts
which
surround
him
before
your
children
here
are
taught
to
venture
themselves
upon
their
feet
he
has
the
perfect
use
of
his
and
can
follow
his
mother
in
her
daily
labours
this
i
remember
was
my
own
case
sometimes
i
used
to
go
with
my
mother
to
the
field
where
all
the
women
of
the
village
were
assembled
to
plant
rice
for
their
subsistence
the
joyful
songs
which
they
used
to
sing
amid
their
toils
delighted
my
infant
ear
and
when
their
daily
task
was
done
they
danced
together
under
the
shade
of
spreading
palms
in
this
manner
did
they
raise
the
simple
food
which
was
sufficient
for
themselves
and
their
children
yams
a
root
resembling
your
potato
indian
corn
and
above
all
rice
to
this
were
added
the
fruits
which
nature
spontaneously
produced
in
our
woods
and
the
produce
of
the
chase
and
fishing
yet
with
this
we
are
as
much
contented
as
you
are
with
all
your
splendid
tables
and
enjoy
a
greater
share
of
health
and
strength
as
soon
as
the
fiery
heat
of
the
sun
declined
you
might
behold
the
master
of
every
cottage
reposing
before
his
own
door
and
feasting
upon
his
mess
of
roots
or
fruits
with
all
his
family
around
him
if
a
traveller
or
stranger
happened
to
come
from
a
distant
country
he
was
welcome
to
enter
into
every
house
and
share
the
provisions
of
the
family
no
door
was
barred
against
his
entrance
no
surly
servant
insulted
him
for
his
poverty
he
entered
wherever
he
pleased
set
himself
down
with
the
family
and
then
pursued
his
journey
or
reposed
himself
in
quiet
till
the
next
morning
in
each
of
our
towns
there
is
generally
a
large
building
where
the
elder
part
of
the
society
are
accustomed
to
meet
in
the
shade
of
the
evening
and
converse
upon
a
variety
of
subjects
the
young
and
vigorous
divert
themselves
with
dances
and
other
pastimes
and
the
children
of
different
ages
amuse
themselves
with
a
thousand
sports
and
gambols
adapted
to
their
age
some
aim
their
little
arrows
at
marks
or
dart
their
light
and
blunted
javelins
at
each
other
to
form
themselves
for
the
exercises
of
war
and
the
chase
others
wrestle
naked
upon
the
sand
or
run
in
sportive
races
with
a
degree
of
activity
which
i
have
never
seen
among
the
europeans
who
pretend
to
be
our
masters
i
have
described
to
you
the
building
of
our
houses
simple
as
they
are
they
answer
every
purpose
of
human
life
and
every
man
is
his
own
architect
a
hundred
or
two
of
these
edifices
compose
our
towns
which
are
generally
surrounded
by
lofty
hedges
of
thorns
to
secure
us
from
the
midnight
attacks
of
wild
beasts
with
only
a
single
entrance
which
is
carefully
closed
at
night
you
talk
said
tommy
of
wild
beasts
pray
have
you
many
in
your
country
yes
master
said
the
black
we
have
them
of
many
sorts
equally
dreadful
and
ferocious
first
we
have
the
which
i
daresay
you
have
heard
of
and
perhaps
seen
he
is
bigger
than
the
largest
mastiff
and
infinitely
stronger
and
more
fierce
his
paws
alone
are
such
that
with
a
single
blow
he
is
able
to
knock
down
a
man
and
almost
every
other
animal
but
these
paws
are
armed
with
claws
so
sharp
and
dreadful
that
nothing
can
resist
their
violence
when
he
roars
every
beast
of
the
forest
betakes
himself
to
flight
and
even
the
boldest
hunter
can
scarcely
hear
it
without
dismay
sometimes
the
most
valiant
of
our
youth
assemble
in
bands
arm
themselves
with
arrows
and
javelins
and
go
to
the
chase
of
these
destructive
animals
when
they
have
found
his
retreat
they
generally
make
a
circle
round
uttering
shouts
and
cries
and
clashing
their
arms
to
rouse
him
to
resistance
the
lion
meanwhile
looks
round
upon
his
assailants
with
indifference
or
contempt
neither
their
number
nor
their
horrid
shouts
nor
the
glitter
of
their
radiant
arms
can
daunt
him
for
an
instant
at
length
he
begins
to
lash
his
sides
with
his
long
and
nervous
tail
a
certain
sign
of
rising
rage
his
eyes
sparkle
with
destructive
fires
and
if
the
number
of
the
hunters
is
very
great
he
perhaps
moves
slowly
on
but
this
he
is
not
permitted
to
do
a
javelin
thrown
at
him
from
behind
wounds
him
in
the
flank
and
compels
him
to
turn
then
you
behold
him
roused
to
fury
and
desperation
neither
wounds
nor
streaming
blood
nor
a
triple
row
of
barbed
spears
can
prevent
him
from
springing
upon
the
daring
black
who
has
wounded
him
should
he
reach
him
in
the
attack
it
is
certain
death
but
generally
the
hunter
who
is
at
once
contending
for
glory
and
his
own
life
and
is
inured
to
danger
avoids
him
by
a
nimble
leap
and
all
his
companions
hasten
to
his
assistance
thus
is
the
lion
pressed
and
wounded
on
every
side
his
rage
is
ineffectual
and
only
exhausts
his
strength
the
faster
a
hundred
wounds
are
pouring
out
his
blood
at
once
and
at
length
he
bites
the
ground
in
the
agonies
of
death
and
yields
the
victory
though
unconquered
when
he
is
dead
he
is
carried
back
in
triumph
by
the
hunters
as
a
trophy
of
their
courage
all
the
village
rushes
out
at
once
the
young
the
old
women
and
children
uttering
joyful
shouts
and
praising
the
valour
of
their
champions
the
elders
admire
his
prodigious
size
his
mighty
limbs
his
dreadful
fangs
and
perhaps
repeat
tales
of
their
own
exploits
the
women
seem
to
tremble
at
their
fierce
enemy
even
in
his
death
while
the
men
compel
their
children
to
approach
the
monster
and
tinge
their
little
weapons
in
his
blood
all
utter
joyful
exclamations
and
feasts
are
made
in
every
house
to
which
the
victors
are
invited
as
the
principal
guests
these
are
intended
at
once
to
reward
those
who
have
performed
so
gallant
an
achievement
and
to
encourage
a
spirit
of
enterprise
in
the
rest
of
the
nation
what
a
dreadful
kind
of
hunting
must
this
be
said
tommy
but
i
suppose
if
any
one
meets
a
lion
alone
it
is
impossible
to
resist
him
not
always
answered
the
black
i
will
tell
you
what
i
once
was
witness
to
myself
my
father
was
reckoned
not
only
the
most
skilful
hunter
but
one
of
the
bravest
of
our
tribe
innumerable
are
the
wild
beasts
which
have
fallen
beneath
his
arm
one
evening
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
whole
village
were
assembled
at
their
sports
and
dances
a
monstrous
lion
allured
i
suppose
by
the
smell
of
human
flesh
burst
unexpectedly
upon
them
without
warning
them
of
his
approach
by
roaring
as
he
commonly
does
as
they
were
unarmed
and
unprepared
for
defence
all
but
my
father
instantly
fled
trembling
to
their
huts
but
he
who
had
never
yet
turned
his
back
upon
any
beast
of
the
forest
drew
from
his
side
a
kind
of
knife
or
dagger
which
he
constantly
wore
and
placing
one
knee
and
one
hand
upon
the
ground
waited
the
approach
of
his
terrible
foe
the
lion
instantly
rushed
upon
him
with
a
fury
not
to
be
described
but
my
father
received
him
upon
the
point
of
his
weapon
with
so
steady
and
so
composed
an
aim
that
he
buried
it
several
inches
in
his
belly
the
beast
attacked
him
a
second
time
and
a
second
time
received
a
dreadful
wound
not
however
without
laying
bare
one
of
my
father
sides
with
a
sudden
stroke
of
his
claws
the
rest
of
the
village
then
rushed
in
and
had
soon
despatched
the
lion
with
innumerable
wounds
this
exploit
appeared
so
extraordinary
that
it
spread
my
father
fame
throughout
the
whole
country
and
gave
him
the
name
of
the
as
an
honourable
distinction
from
the
neighbourhood
under
such
a
parent
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
taught
every
species
of
the
chase
at
first
my
father
only
suffered
me
to
pursue
stags
and
other
feeble
animals
or
took
me
in
his
canoe
to
fish
soon
however
i
was
intrusted
with
a
bow
and
arrows
and
placed
with
many
other
children
and
young
men
to
defend
our
from
the
depredations
of
the
rice
it
is
necessary
to
observe
is
a
plant
that
requires
great
moisture
in
the
soil
all
our
plantations
therefore
are
made
by
the
side
of
rivers
in
the
soft
fertile
soil
which
is
overflowed
in
the
rainy
season
but
when
the
grain
is
almost
ripe
we
are
forced
to
defend
it
from
a
variety
of
hurtful
animals
that
would
otherwise
deprive
us
of
the
fruits
of
our
labours
among
these
one
of
the
principal
is
the
animal
i
have
mentioned
his
size
and
bulk
are
immense
being
twice
the
bigness
of
the
largest
ox
which
i
have
seen
in
this
country
he
has
four
legs
which
are
short
and
thick
a
head
of
a
monstrous
magnitude
and
jaws
that
are
armed
with
teeth
of
a
prodigious
size
and
strength
besides
two
prominent
tusks
which
threaten
destruction
to
all
assailants
but
this
animal
though
so
large
and
strong
is
chiefly
an
inhabitant
of
the
river
where
he
lives
upon
fish
and
it
is
sometimes
a
curious
but
a
dreadful
sight
when
a
boat
is
gliding
over
a
smooth
part
of
the
stream
of
unusual
depth
and
clearness
to
look
down
and
behold
this
monstrous
creature
travelling
along
the
bottom
several
yards
below
the
surface
whenever
this
happens
the
boatman
instantly
paddles
another
way
for
such
is
the
strength
of
the
creature
that
he
is
able
to
overset
a
bark
of
moderate
size
by
rising
under
it
or
to
tear
out
a
plank
with
his
fangs
and
expose
those
who
are
in
it
to
the
dangers
of
an
unexpected
shipwreck
all
the
day
he
chiefly
hides
himself
in
the
water
and
preys
upon
fish
but
during
the
gloom
of
night
he
issues
from
the
river
and
invades
the
fields
of
standing
corn
which
he
would
soon
lay
desolate
were
he
not
driven
back
by
the
shouts
and
cries
of
those
who
are
stationed
to
defend
them
at
this
work
i
had
assisted
several
successive
nights
till
we
were
almost
wearied
with
watching
at
length
one
of
the
most
enterprising
of
our
young
men
proposed
that
we
should
no
longer
content
ourselves
with
driving
back
the
enemy
but
boldly
attack
him
and
punish
him
for
his
temerity
with
this
purpose
we
concealed
ourselves
in
a
convenient
spot
till
we
had
seen
one
of
the
issue
from
the
water
and
advance
a
considerable
way
into
our
plantations
then
we
rushed
from
our
with
furious
shouts
and
cries
and
endeavoured
to
intercept
his
return
but
the
beast
confiding
in
his
superior
strength
advanced
slowly
on
snarling
horribly
and
gnashing
his
dreadful
tusks
and
in
this
manner
he
opened
his
way
through
the
thickest
of
our
battalions
in
vain
we
poured
upon
him
on
every
side
our
darts
and
arrows
and
every
missive
weapon
so
well
defended
was
he
in
an
impenetrable
hide
that
every
weapon
either
rebounded
as
from
a
wall
or
glanced
aside
without
in
the
least
annoying
at
length
one
of
the
boldest
of
our
youth
advanced
unguardedly
upon
him
and
endeavoured
to
wound
him
from
a
shorter
distance
but
the
furious
beast
rushed
upon
him
with
an
unexpected
degree
of
swiftness
ripped
up
his
body
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
enormous
tusk
and
then
seizing
him
in
his
furious
jaws
lifted
up
his
mangled
body
as
if
in
triumph
and
crushed
him
into
a
bleeding
and
promiscuous
mass
fear
instantly
seized
upon
our
company
all
involuntarily
retreated
and
seemed
inclined
to
quit
the
unequal
combat
all
but
myself
who
inflamed
with
grief
and
rage
for
the
loss
of
my
companion
determined
either
to
revenge
his
death
or
perish
in
the
attempt
seeing
therefore
that
it
was
in
vain
to
attack
the
animal
in
the
usual
manner
i
chose
the
sharpest
arrow
and
fitted
it
to
the
bowstring
then
with
a
cool
unterrified
aim
observing
him
moving
nimbly
into
the
river
i
discharged
it
full
at
his
broad
and
glaring
with
such
success
that
the
barbed
point
penetrated
even
to
his
brain
and
the
monster
fell
expiring
to
the
ground
illustration
i
discharged
it
full
at
his
broad
and
glaring
with
such
success
that
the
barbed
point
penetrated
even
to
his
brain
this
action
magnified
beyond
its
deserts
gained
me
universal
applause
throughout
the
hamlet
i
was
from
that
time
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
valiant
and
fortunate
of
our
youth
the
immense
body
of
the
monster
which
i
had
slain
was
cut
to
pieces
and
borne
in
triumph
to
the
village
all
the
young
women
received
me
with
songs
of
joy
and
congratulations
the
young
men
adopted
me
as
their
leader
in
every
hazardous
expedition
and
the
elders
applauded
me
with
such
expressions
of
esteem
as
filled
my
ignorant
heart
with
vanity
and
exultation
but
what
was
more
agreeable
to
me
than
all
the
rest
my
father
received
me
with
transport
and
pressing
me
to
his
bosom
with
tears
of
joy
told
me
that
now
he
could
die
with
pleasure
since
i
had
exceeded
his
most
sanguine
expectations
said
he
not
lived
inactive
or
inglorious
i
have
transfixed
the
tiger
with
my
shafts
i
have
though
alone
attacked
the
lion
in
his
rage
the
terror
of
the
woods
the
fiercest
of
animals
even
the
elephant
has
been
compelled
to
turn
his
back
and
fly
before
my
javelin
but
never
in
the
pride
of
my
youth
and
strength
did
i
achieve
such
an
exploit
as
this
he
then
went
into
his
cabin
and
brought
forth
the
bow
and
fatal
arrows
which
he
was
accustomed
to
use
in
the
chase
them
take
them
said
he
son
and
rescue
my
weaker
arm
from
a
burthen
which
it
is
no
longer
destined
to
sustain
age
is
now
creeping
on
my
blood
begins
to
cool
my
sinews
slacken
and
i
am
no
longer
equal
to
the
task
of
supporting
the
glories
of
our
race
that
care
shall
now
be
thine
and
with
a
firmer
hand
shalt
thou
henceforth
use
these
weapons
against
the
beasts
of
the
forest
and
the
enemies
of
our
country
such
was
the
account
which
the
negro
gave
to
tommy
in
different
conversations
of
his
birth
and
education
his
curiosity
was
gratified
with
the
recital
and
his
heart
expanded
in
the
same
proportion
that
his
knowledge
improved
he
reflected
with
shame
and
contempt
upon
the
ridiculous
prejudices
he
had
once
entertained
he
learned
to
consider
all
men
as
his
brethren
and
equals
and
the
foolish
distinctions
which
pride
had
formerly
suggested
were
gradually
obliterated
from
his
mind
such
a
change
in
his
sentiments
rendered
him
more
mild
more
obliging
more
engaging
than
ever
he
became
the
delight
of
all
the
family
and
harry
although
he
had
always
loved
him
now
knew
no
limits
to
his
affection
one
day
tommy
was
surprised
by
an
unexpected
visit
from
his
father
who
met
him
with
open
arms
and
told
him
that
he
was
now
come
to
take
him
back
to
his
own
house
i
have
heard
said
he
such
an
account
of
your
present
behaviour
that
the
past
is
entirely
forgotten
and
i
begin
to
glory
in
owning
you
for
a
son
he
then
embraced
him
with
the
transports
of
an
affectionate
father
who
indulges
the
strongest
sentiments
of
his
heart
but
sentiments
he
had
long
been
forced
to
restrain
tommy
returned
his
father
caresses
with
genuine
warmth
but
with
a
degree
of
respect
and
humility
he
had
once
been
little
accustomed
to
use
i
will
accompany
you
home
sir
said
he
with
the
greatest
readiness
for
i
wish
to
see
my
mother
and
hope
to
give
her
some
satisfaction
by
my
future
behaviour
you
have
both
had
too
much
to
complain
of
in
the
past
and
i
am
unworthy
of
such
affectionate
parents
he
then
turned
his
face
aside
and
shed
a
tear
of
real
virtue
and
gratitude
which
he
instantly
wiped
away
as
unworthy
the
composure
and
fortitude
of
his
new
character
but
sir
added
he
i
hope
you
will
not
object
to
my
detaining
you
a
little
longer
while
i
return
my
acknowledgments
to
all
the
family
and
take
my
leave
of
harry
surely
said
mr
merton
you
can
entertain
no
doubt
on
that
subject
and
to
give
you
every
opportunity
of
discharging
all
your
duties
to
a
family
to
which
you
owe
so
much
i
intend
to
take
a
dinner
with
mr
sandford
whom
i
now
see
coming
home
and
then
to
return
with
you
in
the
evening
at
this
instant
farmer
sandford
approached
and
very
respectfully
saluting
mr
merton
invited
him
to
walk
in
but
mr
merton
after
returning
his
civility
drew
him
aside
as
if
he
had
some
private
business
to
communicate
when
they
were
alone
he
made
him
every
acknowledgment
that
gratitude
could
suggest
but
words
added
mr
merton
are
very
insufficient
to
return
the
favours
i
have
received
for
it
is
to
your
excellent
family
together
with
the
virtuous
mr
barlow
that
i
owe
the
preservation
of
my
son
let
me
therefore
entreat
you
to
accept
of
what
this
contains
as
a
slight
proof
of
my
sentiments
and
lay
it
out
in
whatever
manner
you
please
for
the
advantage
of
your
family
mr
sandford
who
was
a
man
both
of
sense
and
humour
took
the
book
and
examining
the
inside
found
that
it
contained
to
the
amount
of
some
hundred
pounds
he
then
carefully
shut
it
up
again
and
returning
it
to
mr
merton
told
him
that
he
was
infinitely
obliged
to
him
for
the
generosity
which
prompted
him
to
such
a
princely
act
but
as
to
the
present
itself
he
must
not
be
offended
if
he
declined
it
mr
merton
still
more
astonished
at
such
disinterestedness
pressed
him
with
every
argument
he
could
think
of
he
desired
him
to
consider
the
state
of
his
family
his
daughters
unprovided
for
his
son
himself
with
dispositions
that
might
adorn
a
throne
brought
up
to
labour
and
his
own
advancing
age
which
demanded
ease
and
respite
and
an
increase
of
the
conveniences
of
life
and
what
replied
the
honest
farmer
is
it
but
these
conveniences
of
life
that
are
the
ruin
of
all
the
nation
when
i
was
a
young
man
master
merton
and
that
is
near
forty
years
ago
people
in
my
condition
thought
of
nothing
but
doing
their
duty
to
god
and
man
and
labouring
hard
this
brought
down
a
blessing
upon
their
heads
and
made
them
thrive
in
all
their
worldly
concerns
when
i
was
a
boy
farmers
did
not
lie
droning
in
bed
as
they
do
now
till
six
or
seven
my
father
i
believe
was
as
good
a
judge
of
business
as
any
in
the
neighbourhood
and
turned
as
straight
a
furrow
as
any
ploughman
in
the
county
of
devon
that
silver
cup
which
i
intend
to
have
the
honour
of
drinking
your
health
out
of
at
dinner
that
very
cup
was
won
by
him
at
the
great
near
axminster
well
my
father
used
to
say
that
a
farmer
was
not
worth
a
farthing
that
was
not
in
the
field
by
four
and
my
poor
dear
mother
too
the
woman
in
the
world
she
always
began
milking
exactly
at
five
and
if
a
single
soul
was
to
be
found
in
bed
after
four
in
the
summer
you
might
have
heard
her
from
one
end
of
the
farm
to
the
other
i
would
not
disparage
anybody
or
anything
my
good
sir
but
those
were
times
indeed
the
women
then
knew
something
about
the
management
of
a
house
it
really
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
hear
my
poor
mother
lecture
the
servants
and
the
men
were
men
indeed
pray
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
father
being
at
truro
and
throwing
the
famous
cornish
wrestler
the
miner
mr
merton
began
to
be
convinced
that
whatever
other
qualities
good
mr
sandford
might
have
he
did
not
excel
in
brevity
and
therefore
endeavoured
in
still
stronger
terms
to
overcome
the
delicacy
of
the
farmer
and
prevail
upon
him
to
accept
his
present
but
the
good
farmer
pursued
his
point
thus
thank
you
thank
you
my
dear
sir
a
thousand
times
for
your
goodwill
but
as
to
the
money
i
must
beg
your
pardon
if
i
persist
in
refusing
it
formerly
sir
as
i
was
saying
we
were
all
happy
and
healthy
and
our
affairs
prospered
because
we
never
thought
about
the
conveniences
of
life
now
i
hear
of
nothing
else
one
neighbour
for
i
will
not
mention
names
brings
his
son
up
to
go
with
gentlemen
another
sends
his
to
market
upon
a
with
a
plated
bridle
and
then
the
girls
the
girls
there
is
fine
work
indeed
they
must
have
their
hats
and
feathers
and
riding
habits
their
heads
as
big
as
bushels
and
even
their
stuck
out
with
cork
or
pasteboard
but
scarcely
one
of
them
can
milk
a
cow
or
churn
or
bake
or
do
any
one
thing
that
is
necessary
in
a
family
so
that
unless
the
government
will
send
them
all
to
this
new
settlement
which
i
have
heard
so
much
of
and
bring
us
a
cargo
of
plain
honest
housewives
who
have
never
been
at
i
can
not
conceive
how
we
farmers
are
to
get
wives
mr
merton
laughed
very
heartily
at
this
sally
and
told
him
that
he
would
venture
to
assert
it
was
not
so
at
house
not
quite
so
bad
indeed
said
the
farmer
my
wife
was
bred
up
under
a
notable
mother
and
though
she
must
have
her
tea
every
afternoon
is
in
the
main
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
she
has
brought
her
daughters
up
a
little
better
than
usual
but
i
can
assure
you
she
and
i
have
had
many
a
good
argument
on
the
subject
not
but
she
approves
their
milking
spinning
and
making
themselves
useful
but
she
would
fain
have
them
genteel
master
merton
all
women
now
are
mad
after
gentility
and
when
once
begins
there
is
an
end
of
now
were
they
to
hear
of
such
a
sum
as
you
have
generously
offered
there
would
be
no
peace
in
the
house
my
wenches
instead
of
and
would
be
and
in
a
little
time
they
must
be
sent
to
to
learn
french
and
music
and
wriggling
about
the
room
and
when
they
come
back
who
must
boil
the
pot
or
make
the
pudding
or
sweep
the
house
or
serve
the
pigs
did
you
ever
hear
of
miss
juliana
or
miss
harriet
or
miss
carolina
doing
such
vulgar
things
mr
merton
was
very
much
struck
with
the
honest
farmer
method
of
expressing
himself
and
could
not
help
internally
allowing
the
truth
of
his
representations
yet
he
still
pressed
him
to
accept
his
present
and
reminded
him
of
the
improvement
of
his
farm
thank
you
again
and
again
replied
the
farmer
but
the
whole
generation
of
the
sandfords
have
been
brought
up
to
labour
with
their
own
hands
for
these
hundred
years
and
during
all
that
time
there
has
not
been
a
dishonest
person
a
gentleman
or
a
madman
amongst
us
and
shall
i
be
the
first
to
break
the
customs
of
the
family
and
perhaps
bring
down
a
curse
on
all
our
heads
what
could
i
have
more
if
i
were
a
lord
or
a
macaroni
as
i
think
you
call
them
i
have
plenty
of
victuals
and
work
good
firing
clothes
warm
house
a
little
for
the
poor
and
between
you
and
i
something
perhaps
in
a
corner
to
set
my
children
off
with
if
they
behave
well
ah
neighbour
neighbour
if
you
did
but
know
the
pleasure
of
holding
plough
after
a
good
team
of
horses
and
then
going
tired
to
bed
perhaps
you
wish
to
have
been
brought
up
a
farmer
too
but
in
one
word
as
well
as
a
thousand
i
shall
never
forget
the
extraordinary
kindness
of
your
offer
but
if
you
would
not
ruin
a
whole
family
of
innocent
people
that
love
you
consent
to
leave
us
as
we
are
mr
merton
then
seeing
the
fixed
determination
of
the
farmer
and
feeling
the
justice
of
his
coarse
but
strong
morality
was
obliged
however
reluctantly
to
desist
and
mrs
sandford
coming
to
invite
them
to
dinner
he
entered
the
house
and
paid
his
respects
to
the
family
after
the
cloth
was
removed
and
mr
sandford
had
twice
or
thrice
replenished
his
silver
mug
the
only
piece
of
finery
in
his
house
little
harry
came
running
in
with
so
much
alacrity
and
heedlessness
that
he
tore
miss
deborah
best
apron
and
he
had
nearly
precipitated
miss
catherine
new
cap
into
the
fire
for
which
the
young
ladies
and
his
mother
rebuked
him
with
some
acrimony
but
harry
after
begging
pardon
with
his
usual
cried
father
father
here
is
the
prettiest
team
of
horses
all
matched
and
of
a
colour
with
new
harness
the
most
complete
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
they
have
stopped
at
our
and
the
man
says
they
are
brought
for
you
farmer
sandford
was
just
then
in
the
middle
of
his
history
of
the
at
axminster
but
the
relation
of
his
son
had
such
an
involuntary
effect
upon
him
that
he
started
up
overset
the
liquor
and
the
table
and
making
a
hasty
apology
to
mr
merton
ran
out
to
see
these
wonderful
horses
presently
he
returned
in
equal
admiration
with
his
son
master
merton
said
he
i
did
not
think
you
had
been
so
good
a
judge
of
a
horse
i
suppose
they
are
a
new
purchase
which
you
want
to
have
my
opinion
upon
and
i
can
assure
you
they
are
the
true
suffolk
sorrels
the
first
breed
of
in
the
kingdom
and
these
are
some
of
the
best
of
their
kind
such
as
they
are
answered
mr
merton
they
are
yours
and
i
can
not
think
after
the
obligations
i
am
under
to
your
family
that
you
will
do
me
so
great
a
displeasure
as
to
refuse
mr
sandford
stood
for
some
time
in
mute
astonishment
but
at
length
he
was
beginning
the
civilest
speech
he
could
think
of
to
refuse
so
great
a
present
when
tommy
coming
up
took
him
by
the
hand
and
begged
him
not
to
deny
to
his
father
and
himself
the
first
favour
they
had
ever
asked
besides
said
he
this
present
is
less
to
yourself
than
to
little
harry
and
surely
after
having
lived
so
long
in
your
family
you
will
not
turn
me
out
with
disgrace
as
if
i
had
misbehaved
here
harry
himself
interposed
and
considering
less
the
value
of
the
present
than
the
feelings
and
intentions
of
the
giver
he
took
his
father
by
the
hand
and
besought
him
to
oblige
master
merton
and
his
father
were
it
any
one
else
i
would
not
say
a
word
added
he
but
i
know
the
generosity
of
mr
merton
and
the
goodness
of
master
tommy
so
well
that
they
will
receive
more
pleasure
from
giving
than
you
from
taking
the
horses
though
i
must
confess
they
are
such
as
would
do
credit
to
anybody
and
they
beat
farmer
knowles
all
to
nothing
which
have
long
been
reckoned
the
best
team
in
all
the
country
this
last
reflection
joined
with
all
that
had
preceded
overcame
the
delicacy
of
mr
sandford
and
he
at
length
consented
to
order
the
horses
to
be
led
into
his
stable
and
now
mr
merton
having
made
the
most
affectionate
acknowledgments
to
all
this
worthy
and
happy
family
among
whom
he
did
not
forget
the
honest
black
whom
he
promised
to
provide
for
summoned
his
son
to
accompany
him
home
tommy
arose
and
with
the
sincerest
gratitude
bade
adieu
to
harry
and
all
the
rest
i
shall
not
be
long
without
you
said
he
to
harry
to
your
example
i
owe
most
of
the
little
good
that
i
can
boast
you
have
taught
me
how
much
better
it
is
to
be
useful
than
rich
or
fine
how
much
more
amiable
to
be
good
than
to
be
great
should
i
ever
be
tempted
to
relapse
even
for
an
instant
into
any
of
my
former
habits
i
will
return
hither
for
instruction
and
i
hope
you
will
again
receive
me
saying
this
he
shook
his
friend
harry
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
with
watery
eyes
accompanied
his
father
