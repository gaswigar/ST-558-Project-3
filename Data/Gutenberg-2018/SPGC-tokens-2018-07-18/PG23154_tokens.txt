i
dedicate
this
romance
of
friendship
to
you
with
the
sincerest
pleasure
and
affection
you
were
the
first
to
suggest
that
i
should
write
a
book
about
contemporary
life
at
harrow
you
gave
me
the
principal
idea
you
have
furnished
me
with
notes
innumerable
you
have
revised
every
page
of
the
manuscript
and
you
are
a
peculiarly
keen
harrovian
in
making
this
public
declaration
of
my
obligations
to
you
i
take
the
opportunity
of
stating
that
the
characters
in
the
hill
whether
masters
or
boys
are
not
portraits
although
they
may
be
called
truthfully
enough
composite
photographs
and
that
the
episodes
of
drinking
and
gambling
are
founded
on
isolated
incidents
not
on
habitual
practices
moreover
in
attempting
to
reproduce
the
curious
admixture
of
strenuousness
and
sentiment
your
own
phrase
which
animates
so
vitally
harrow
life
i
have
been
obliged
to
select
the
less
common
types
of
harrovian
only
the
elect
are
capable
of
such
friendship
as
john
verney
entertained
for
henry
desmond
and
few
boys
happily
are
possessed
of
such
powers
as
scaife
is
shown
to
exercise
but
that
there
are
such
boys
as
verney
and
scaife
nobody
knows
better
than
yourself
believe
me
yours

five
hundred
faces
and
all
so
strange
life
in
front
of
me
home
behind
i
felt
like
a
waif
before
the
wind
tossed
on
an
ocean
of
shock
and
change
yet
the
time
may
come
as
the
years
go
by
when
your
heart
will
thrill
at
the
thought
of
the
hill
and
the
day
that
you
came
so
strange
and
shy
the
train
slid
slowly
out
of
harrow
station
five
minutes
before
a
man
and
a
boy
had
been
walking
up
and
down
the
long
platform
the
boy
wondered
why
the
man
his
uncle
was
so
strangely
silent
then
suddenly
the
elder
john
verney
had
placed
his
hands
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
younger
john
looking
down
into
eyes
as
grey
and
as
steady
as
his
own
you
find
plenty
of
fellows
abusing
harrow
he
said
quietly
but
take
it
from
me
that
the
fault
lies
not
in
harrow
but
in
them
such
boys
as
a
rule
do
not
come
out
of
the
top
drawer
do
look
so
solemn
you
about
to
take
a
header
into
a
big
river
in
it
are
rocks
and
rapids
but
you
know
how
to
swim
and
after
the
first
plunge
enjoy
it
as
i
did
amazingly
ra
ther
said
john
in
the
new
forest
where
john
had
spent
most
of
his
life
at
his
place
of
verney
boscobel
this
uncle
his
dead
father
only
brother
was
worshipped
as
a
hero
indeed
he
filled
so
large
a
space
in
the
imagination
that
others
were
cramped
for
room
john
verney
in
india
in
burmah
in
africa
he
took
continents
in
his
stride
moved
colossal
and
when
uncle
and
nephew
met
behold
the
great
traveller
stood
not
much
taller
than
john
himself
that
first
moment
the
instant
shattering
of
a
precious
delusion
held
anguish
but
now
as
the
train
whirled
away
the
silent
thin
little
man
he
began
to
expand
again
john
saw
him
scaling
heights
cutting
a
path
through
impenetrable
forests
wading
across
dismal
swamps
an
figure
seeking
the
hitherto
unknowable
and
irreclaimable
introducing
order
where
chaos
reigned
supreme
a
pioneer
how
good
to
think
that
john
verney
was
uncle
blood
of
his
blood
his
his
his
for
all
time
and
long
ago
john
senior
had
come
to
harrow
had
felt
what
john
junior
felt
to
the
core
the
dull
grinding
wrench
of
separation
the
sense
not
yet
to
be
analysed
by
a
boy
of
standing
alone
upon
the
edge
of
a
river
indeed
into
which
he
must
plunge
headlong
in
a
few
minutes
well
uncle
john
had
taken
his
header
with
a
stout
heart
who
dared
to
doubt
that
surely
he
had
not
waited
shivering
and
hesitating
at
the
place
the
train
was
now
out
of
sight
john
slipped
the
uncle
tip
into
his
purse
and
walked
out
of
the
station
and
on
to
the
road
beyond
the
road
which
led
to
the
top
of
the
hill
presently
the
boy
reached
some
iron
palings
and
a
his
uncle
had
pointed
out
this
gate
and
the
steep
path
beyond
which
led
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
the
churchyard
to
the
peachey
tomb
on
which
byron
dreamed
to
the
high
street
and
to
the
manor
it
was
pleasant
to
remember
that
he
was
going
to
board
at
the
manor
with
its
traditions
its
triumphs
its
record
in
his
uncle
day
the
manor
ranked
first
among
the
not
a
doubt
disturbed
conviction
that
it
ranked
first
still
the
boy
stared
upwards
with
a
keen
gaze
had
the
mother
seen
her
son
at
that
moment
she
might
have
discerned
a
subtle
likeness
between
uncle
and
nephew
not
the
likeness
of
the
flesh
but
of
the
spirit
september
rains
followed
by
a
day
of
warm
sunshine
had
lured
from
the
earth
a
soft
haze
which
obscured
the
big
fields
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
john
could
make
out
fences
poplars
elms
scotch
firs
and
spectral
houses
but
above
everything
was
clear
the
such
as
he
could
see
stood
out
boldly
against
a
cloudless
sky
and
above
these
soared
the
spire
of
harrow
church
pointing
an
inexorable
finger
upwards
afterwards
this
spot
became
dear
to
john
verney
because
here
where
mists
were
chill
and
blinding
he
had
been
impelled
to
leave
the
broad
and
take
a
path
which
led
into
a
shadowy
future
in
obedience
to
an
impulse
stronger
than
himself
he
had
taken
the
short
cut
to
what
awaited
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
outside
the
palings
trying
to
choke
down
an
abominable
lump
in
his
throat
this
was
not
his
first
visit
to
harrow
at
the
end
of
the
previous
term
he
had
ascended
the
hill
to
pass
the
entrance
examination
a
master
from
his
preparatory
school
accompanied
him
an
etonian
who
had
stared
rather
superciliously
so
john
thought
at
buildings
less
venerable
than
those
which
henry
vi
raised
near
windsor
john
who
had
perceptions
was
elusively
conscious
that
his
companion
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
give
his
thoughts
words
might
be
contrasting
a
yeoman
work
with
a
king
and
when
the
etonian
gazing
across
the
plains
below
to
where
windsor
lay
a
soft
shadow
upon
the
horizon
said
abruptly
i
wish
eton
had
been
built
upon
a
hill
john
replied
effusively
oh
sir
it
decent
of
you
to
say
that
the
examination
however
distracted
his
attention
from
all
things
save
the
papers
to
his
delight
he
found
these
easy
and
as
soon
as
he
left
the
he
was
popped
into
a
cab
and
taken
back
to
town
coming
down
the
flight
of
steps
he
had
seen
a
few
boys
hurrying
up
or
down
the
road
at
these
the
etonian
cocked
a
twinkling
eye
queer
kit
you
harrow
boys
wear
he
said
john
inordinately
grateful
at
this
recognition
of
himself
as
an
harrovian
forgave
the
gibe
it
had
struck
him
also
that
the
shallow
straw
hat
the
coat
did
look
queer
but
he
regarded
them
reverently
as
the
uniform
of
a
crack
corps
standing
by
the
iron
palings
john
reviewed
the
events
of
the
last
hour
the
view
was
blurred
by
unshed
tears
his
uncle
and
he
had
driven
together
to
the
manor
here
the
explorer
had
exercised
his
peculiar
personal
magnetism
upon
the
a
tall
burly
man
of
truculent
aspect
and
speech
john
realized
proudly
that
his
uncle
was
the
bigger
of
the
two
and
the
giant
acknowledged
perhaps
grudgingly
the
dwarf
superiority
the
talk
short
enough
had
wandered
into
darkest
africa
his
uncle
as
usual
said
little
replying
almost
in
monosyllables
to
the
questions
of
his
host
but
john
junior
told
himself
exultantly
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
uncle
john
to
talk
the
wide
world
knew
what
he
had
done
then
his
rutford
had
told
john
where
to
buy
his
first
straw
hat
you
can
get
one
without
an
order
at
the
beginning
of
each
term
said
he
in
a
thick
rasping
voice
but
you
must
ask
me
for
an
order
if
you
want
a
second
then
he
had
shown
john
his
room
to
be
shared
with
two
other
boys
and
had
told
him
the
hour
of
and
then
after
tea
came
the
walk
down
the
hill
the
tip
the
firm
grasp
of
the
sinewy
hand
and
a
final
god
bless
you
coming
to
the
end
of
these
reflections
confronted
by
the
inexorable
future
and
the
necessity
no
less
inexorable
of
stepping
into
it
john
passed
through
the
gate
his
heart
fluttered
furiously
and
the
lump
in
the
throat
swelled
inconveniently
john
however
had
provided
himself
with
a
plunging
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
pulled
out
a
cartridge
an
unused
gun
cartridge
looking
at
this
john
smiled
when
he
smiled
he
became
the
face
too
long
plain
but
full
of
sense
and
humour
rounded
itself
into
the
gracious
curves
of
youth
the
serious
grey
eyes
sparkled
the
lips
too
firmly
compressed
parted
revealing
admirable
teeth
small
and
squarely
set
into
the
cheeks
brown
rather
than
pink
flowed
a
warm
stream
of
colour
the
cartridge
stood
for
so
much
only
a
week
before
uncle
john
on
his
arrival
from
manchuria
had
handed
his
nephew
a
small
leather
case
and
a
key
the
case
held
a
hammerless
ejector
gun
with
a
great
name
upon
its
polished
blue
barrels
the
sight
of
the
cartridge
justified
john
expectations
he
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
strode
forward
and
upward
close
to
the
school
chapel
john
remarked
a
young
gentleman
of
wonderfully
prepossessing
appearance
from
whom
emanated
an
air
an
atmosphere
of
genial
enjoyment
which
diffused
itself
the
bricks
of
the
seemed
redder
and
warmer
as
if
they
were
basking
in
this
sunny
smile
the
youth
was
smiling
now
smiling
at
john
for
several
hours
john
had
been
miserably
aware
that
surprises
awaited
him
but
not
smiles
he
knew
no
harrovians
at
his
school
a
small
one
his
fellows
were
labelled
winchester
eton
wellington
none
curiously
enough
harrow
and
already
he
had
passed
half
a
dozen
boys
the
some
strangers
like
himself
and
in
each
face
he
had
read
indifference
not
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
say
hullo
who
are
you
after
the
rough
and
ready
fashion
of
the
private
school
and
now
this
smiling
fascinating
person
was
actually
about
to
address
him
and
in
the
old
familiar
style
hullo
hullo
i
met
your
governor
the
other
day
did
you
john
replied
his
father
had
died
when
john
was
seven
obviously
a
blunder
in
identity
had
created
this
genial
smile
john
wished
that
his
father
had
not
died
yes
pursued
the
smiling
one
i
met
him
at
home
and
he
asked
me
to
be
on
the
for
you
it
queer
you
should
turn
up
at
once
is
it
yes
said
john
your
governor
looked
awfully
fit
did
he
then
john
added
solemnly
my
governor
died
when
i
was
a
kid
the
other
gasped
then
he
threw
back
his
curly
head
and
laughed
i
say
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
mean
to
laugh
if
you
not
hardacre
who
are
you
verney
i
just
come
verney
that
a
great
harrow
name
are
you
any
relation
to
the
explorer
nephew
said
john
blushing
ah
you
ought
to
have
been
here
last
speecher
we
cheered
him
i
can
tell
you
and
the
song
was
sung
the
one
with
his
name
in
it
yes
said
john
then
he
added
nervously
all
the
same
i
do
know
a
soul
at
harrow
desmond
smiled
the
smile
assured
john
that
his
name
would
secure
him
a
cordial
welcome
desmond
added
abruptly
my
name
desmond
is
a
harrow
name
my
father
my
grandfather
my
uncles
and
three
brothers
were
here
it
does
make
a
difference
what
your
house
the
manor
said
john
proudly
dirty
dick
then
seeing
consternation
writ
large
upon
john
face
he
added
quickly
we
call
dirty
dick
you
know
but
the
house
is
er
one
of
the
oldest
and
biggest
er
houses
he
continued
hurriedly
i
going
into
damer
next
term
damer
is
always
you
know
why
is
rutford
called
dick
john
asked
nervously
he
dirty
oh
we
licked
him
into
a
sort
of
shape
said
desmond
i
he
toshes
now
once
a
month
or
so
toshes
tubs
you
know
we
call
a
tub
a
when
dirty
dick
came
here
he
was
unclean
he
told
his
form
oh
the
cheek
of
it
that
in
his
filthy
mind
one
bath
a
week
was
plenty
unconsciously
the
boy
mimicked
the
thick
rasping
tones
two
luxury
and
three
superfluity
after
that
he
was
called
dirty
dick
there
another
story
they
say
that
years
ago
he
went
to
a
turkish
bath
and
after
a
rare
good
scraping
the
man
who
was
scraping
him
nasty
job
that
found
something
which
dirty
dick
recognized
as
a
beastly
flannel
shirt
he
had
lost
when
he
was
at
the
but
only
the
fourth
form
boys
swallow
hullo
there
a
pal
of
mine
see
you
again
he
ran
off
gaily
john
walked
to
the
shop
where
straw
hats
were
sold
here
he
met
other
new
boys
who
regarded
him
curiously
but
said
nothing
john
put
on
his
hat
and
gave
rutford
name
to
the
young
man
who
waited
on
him
he
had
an
absurd
feeling
that
the
young
man
would
say
oh
yes
dirty
dick
one
very
boy
said
to
another
boy
that
he
was
at
damer
john
could
have
sworn
that
the
hatter
assistant
regarded
the
pink
youth
with
increased
deference
why
had
uncle
john
sent
him
to
dirty
dick
he
hurried
out
of
the
shop
fuming
then
he
remembered
the
hammerless
gun
after
all
the
manor
had
been
house
once
and
it
might
be
house
again
by
this
time
the
boys
were
arriving
groups
were
forming
snatches
of
chatter
reached
john
ears
yes
i
shot
a
stag
a
my
governor
is
going
to
have
it
set
up
for
me
what
walked
up
your
grouse
with
dogs
we
drive
ours
i
had
some
ripping
cricket
made
a
century
in
one
match
by
jove
did
you
really
john
passed
on
these
were
bloods
tremendous
swells
grown
men
with
a
titillating
flavour
of
the
world
about
their
distinguished
persons
a
minute
later
he
was
staring
disconsolately
at
a
group
of
his
fellows
just
in
front
of
dir
of
rutford
side
door
an
impulse
seized
him
to
turn
and
flee
what
would
uncle
john
say
to
that
so
he
advanced
the
boys
made
way
politely
asking
no
questions
as
he
passed
through
he
caught
a
few
eager
words
i
was
hoping
that
the
brute
had
gone
it
a
sickener
and
no
mistake
john
ascended
the
battered
staircase
wondering
who
the
brute
was
perhaps
a
sort
of
flashman
john
knew
his
but
some
one
had
told
him
that
bullying
had
ceased
to
be
great
emphasis
had
been
laid
on
the
brute
whoever
he
might
be
upon
the
passage
he
found
his
room
and
one
of
its
tenants
who
nodded
carelessly
as
john
crossed
the
threshold
i
scaife
he
said
are
you
the
lord
or
the
commoner
he
laughed
indicating
a
large
portmanteau
labelled
lord
esmé
kinloch
i
verney
said
john
i
bagged
the
best
bed
said
scaife
after
a
pause
and
i
advise
you
to
bag
the
next
best
one
over
there
it
was
mine
last
term
i
do
see
the
beds
said
john
staring
about
him
scaife
pointed
out
what
appeared
to
be
three
tall
narrow
wardrobes
the
rest
of
the
furniture
included
three
washstands
and
chests
of
drawers
four
windsor
chairs
and
a
square
table
covered
with
innumerable
inkstains
and
names
the
beds
let
down
scaife
said
and
during
the
first
school
the
maids
make
them
and
shut
them
up
again
it
is
considered
a
joke
to
crawl
into
another
fellow
room
at
night
and
shut
him
up
you
find
yourself
standing
upon
your
head
in
the
dark
choking
it
is
a
joke
for
the
other
fellow
did
some
one
do
that
to
you
asked
john
yes
a
big
lout
in
the
third
fifth
scaife
smiled
grimly
and
what
did
you
do
i
waited
for
him
next
day
with
a
cricket
stump
there
was
an
awful
row
because
i
let
him
have
it
a
bit
too
hard
but
i
not
been
shut
up
since
that
bed
is
a
beast
it
collapses
he
chuckled
young
kinloch
wo
find
it
quite
as
soft
as
the
ones
at
white
ladies
well
like
the
rest
of
us
he
have
to
take
dirty
dick
as
he
finds
it
the
bolt
had
fallen
john
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
then
it
called
that
called
what
this
house
dirty
dick
scaife
smiled
cynically
he
looked
about
a
year
older
than
john
but
he
had
the
air
and
manners
of
a
man
of
the
world
so
john
thought
also
he
was
very
handsomer
than
desmond
and
in
striking
contrast
to
that
smiling
genial
youth
being
dark
almost
swarthy
of
complexion
with
features
and
rather
coarse
hands
and
feet
everybody
here
calls
it
dirty
dick
he
replied
curtly
john
stared
helplessly
but
he
muttered
i
heard
i
was
told
that
the
manor
was
the
best
house
in
the
school
it
used
to
be
scaife
answered
it
comes
jolly
near
being
the
worst
the
fellows
in
other
houses
are
decent
they
do
rub
it
in
but
between
ourselves
the
manor
has
gone
to
pot
ever
since
dirty
dick
took
hold
of
it
damer
is
the
swell
house
now
john
began
to
unstrap
his
portmanteau
scaife
puzzled
him
for
instance
he
displayed
no
curiosity
he
did
not
put
the
questions
always
asked
at
a
preparatory
school
without
turning
his
thought
into
words
john
divined
that
at
harrow
it
was
bad
form
to
ask
questions
as
he
wanted
to
ask
a
question
a
very
important
question
this
enforced
silence
became
exasperating
presently
scaife
said
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
the
claydon
lot
no
my
home
is
in
the
new
forest
my
uncle
is
verney
of
verney
boscobel
oh
his
name
is
on
the
panels
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
and
carved
on
a
bed
in
the
next
room
crikey
i
must
go
and
look
at
it
you
can
look
at
the
panels
of
course
but
do
say
and
do
go
into
the
next
room
two
fifth
form
fellows
have
it
it
would
be
infernal
cheek
john
hoped
that
scaife
would
offer
to
accompany
him
to
the
panels
then
he
went
alone
it
being
now
within
half
an
hour
of
the
passages
were
swarming
with
boys
soon
john
would
see
them
assembled
in
hall
where
their
names
would
be
called
over
by
rutford
everybody
john
had
been
told
was
expected
to
be
present
at
this
first
except
a
few
boys
who
might
be
coming
from
a
distance
john
worked
his
way
along
the
upper
passage
and
down
the
second
flight
of
stairs
till
he
came
to
the
first
landing
here
close
to
the
house
were
some
oak
panels
covered
with
names
and
dates
all
carved
so
john
learned
later
by
a
famous
harrow
character
sam
hoare
once
custos
of
the
school
the
boy
glanced
eagerly
ardently
up
and
down
the
panels
ah
yes
here
was
his
father
name
and
here
his
uncle
and
then
out
of
the
dull
oak
shone
other
names
familiar
to
all
who
love
the
hill
and
its
traditions
john
heart
grew
warm
again
with
pride
in
the
house
that
had
held
such
men
the
name
of
the
great
statesman
and
below
it
a
mighty
warrior
made
him
thrill
and
tremble
they
were
these
fellows
men
whom
his
uncle
had
known
men
of
whom
his
dear
mother
wise
soul
had
spoken
a
thousand
times
the
landing
and
the
passages
were
roaring
with
the
life
of
the
present
moment
boys
big
and
small
were
chaffing
each
other
loudly
under
some
circumstances
this
a
stranger
ignored
entirely
might
have
felt
desolate
and
forlorn
in
the
heart
of
such
a
crowd
but
john
was
tingling
with
delight
and
pleasure
suddenly
the
noise
moderated
john
looking
up
saw
a
big
fellow
slowly
approaching
exchanging
greetings
with
everybody
john
turned
to
a
boy
close
to
him
who
is
it
he
whispered
the
other
boy
answered
curtly
lawrence
the
head
of
the
house
the
big
fellow
suddenly
caught
john
eyes
what
he
read
there
admiration
respect
envy
brought
a
slight
smile
to
his
lips
your
name
he
demanded
verney
lawrence
held
out
his
hand
simply
and
yet
with
a
certain
dignity
i
heard
you
were
coming
he
said
keenly
examining
john
face
we
ca
have
too
many
verneys
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
let
me
know
he
nodded
and
strode
on
john
saw
that
several
boys
were
staring
with
a
new
interest
none
however
spoke
to
him
and
he
returned
to
his
room
with
a
blushing
face
scaife
had
unpacked
his
clothes
and
put
them
away
he
was
now
surveying
the
bare
walls
with
undisguised
contempt
is
this
a
beastly
hole
he
remarked
john
always
interested
in
people
rather
than
things
examined
the
room
carefully
passing
down
the
passage
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
other
rooms
some
charmingly
furnished
gay
with
chintz
embellished
with
pictures
japanese
fans
silver
cups
and
other
trophies
comparing
these
with
his
own
apartment
john
said
shyly
it
not
very
beefy
beefy
you
smell
of
a
private
school
verney
now
is
it
worth
doing
up
you
see
i
shall
be
in
a
next
term
if
we
all
chip
in
he
paused
i
brought
back
two
quid
said
john
scaife
smile
indicated
neither
approval
nor
the
reverse
ingenuous
confidence
provoked
none
in
return
we
talk
about
it
when
kinloch
arrives
i
wonder
why
his
people
sent
him
here
john
had
studied
some
books
but
not
the
peerage
the
great
name
of
kinloch
was
new
to
him
not
new
to
scaife
who
for
a
boy
knew
his
burke
too
odiously
well
why
should
his
people
send
him
here
he
asked
because
scaife
tone
was
contemptuous
because
the
kinlochs
they
a
great
cricketing
family
go
to
eton
the
duke
must
have
some
reason
the
duke
hang
it
surely
you
have
heard
of
the
duke
of
trent
yes
said
john
humbly
and
this
is
his
son
he
glanced
at
the
label
on
the
new
portmanteau
whose
son
should
he
be
said
scaife
well
it
queer
dukes
and
dukes
sons
come
to
harrow
all
the
hamiltons
were
here
and
the
fitzroys
and
the
maurs
but
the
kinlochs
as
i
say
have
gone
to
eton
it
a
rum
thing
very
and
why
the
deuce
has
he
turned
up
the
clanging
of
a
bell
brought
both
boys
to
their
feet
and
said
scaife
come
on
they
pushed
their
way
down
the
passage
several
boys
addressed
scaife
hullo
demon
here
the
old
demon
demon
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
sacked
to
these
and
other
sallies
scaife
replied
with
his
slightly
ironical
smile
john
perceived
that
his
companion
was
popular
and
at
the
same
time
peculiar
quite
different
from
any
boy
he
had
yet
met
they
filed
into
a
big
room
the
of
the
house
a
square
lofty
hall
with
three
long
tables
in
it
on
the
walls
hung
some
portraits
of
famous
old
harrovians
as
a
room
it
was
disappointing
at
first
sight
almost
commonplace
but
in
it
john
soon
found
out
everything
for
weal
or
woe
which
concerned
the
manor
had
taken
place
or
had
been
discussed
there
were
two
fireplaces
and
two
large
doors
the
boys
passed
through
one
door
upon
the
threshold
of
the
other
stood
the
butler
holding
a
silver
salver
with
a
sheet
of
paper
on
it
what
cheek
murmured
scaife
eh
said
john
dirty
dick
is
here
just
like
him
the
slacker
and
when
he
does
come
over
on
our
side
of
the
house
he
slimes
about
in
carpet
slippers
the
beast
lawrence
entered
as
scaife
spoke
john
saw
that
his
eyebrows
went
up
when
he
perceived
the
butler
he
approached
and
took
the
sheet
of
paper
the
butler
said
impressively
rutford
is
busy
will
you
call
over
sir
at
any
rate
the
butler
dumbleton
was
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
the
manor
he
had
a
shrewd
face
and
the
deportment
of
an
archbishop
the
head
of
the
house
took
the
paper
and
began
to
call
over
the
names
each
boy
as
his
name
was
called
said
here
or
if
he
wished
to
be
funny
here
verney
the
name
rang
out
crisply
here
said
john
the
head
of
the
house
eyed
him
sharply
kinloch
no
answer
kinloch
scaife
answered
dryly
kinloch
portmanteau
has
come
then
dumbleton
said
in
his
smooth
bland
voice
his
lordship
is
in
the
with
mr
rutford
the
boys
exchanged
knowing
glances
scaife
looked
contemptuous
the
next
moment
the
last
name
had
been
called
and
the
boys
scurried
into
the
passages
lawrence
was
the
first
to
leave
the
hall
impulsively
john
rushed
up
to
him
i
did
mean
to
be
funny
i
did
really
he
panted
quite
right
it
does
pay
lawrence
smiled
grimly
for
new
boys
to
be
funny
i
saw
you
did
mean
it
lawrence
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
john
realized
that
he
had
so
spoken
purposely
trying
to
wipe
out
a
new
boy
first
blunder
thanks
awfully
said
john
he
reached
his
room
to
find
three
other
boys
busily
engaged
in
abusing
their
they
took
no
notice
of
john
who
leaned
against
the
wall
his
lordship
is
in
the
with
mr
rutford
a
youth
with
a
big
elastic
mouth
had
imitated
dumbleton
admirably
what
a
snob
dick
is
drawled
a
very
tall
very
thin
boy
and
a
fool
added
scaife
this
sort
of
thing
makes
him
loathed
it
a
sell
his
being
here
all
three
fell
to
talking
the
question
still
festering
in
john
mind
was
answered
within
a
minute
the
brute
was
rutford
towards
the
end
of
the
previous
term
gossip
had
it
that
the
master
of
the
manor
had
been
offered
an
appointment
elsewhere
whereat
the
worthier
spirits
in
the
ancient
house
rejoiced
now
the
joy
was
turned
into
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
is
he
a
beast
to
said
john
the
boy
answered
affably
that
depends
his
imperial
highness
he
kicked
the
new
portmanteau
hard
will
not
find
richard
rutford
a
beast
far
from
it
and
he
civil
to
the
demon
because
his
papa
is
a
man
of
many
shekels
but
to
mere
outsiders
like
myself
a
beast
of
beasts
ay
the
very
king
of
beasts
is
dirty
dick
and
then
oh
horrors
the
door
of
no
opened
and
rutford
appeared
followed
by
a
seemingly
young
and
very
fashionably
dressed
lady
the
boys
jumped
to
their
feet
all
except
scaife
looked
preternaturally
solemn
the
nodded
carelessly
this
is
scaife
duchess
he
said
in
his
thick
rasping
tones
scaife
and
verney
let
me
present
you
to
the
duchess
of
trent
he
mouthed
the
illustrious
name
as
if
it
were
a
large
and
ripe
greengage
the
duchess
advanced
smiling
graciously
these
rutford
named
the
other
boys
are
egerton
lovell
and
er
duff
scaife
alone
of
those
present
appreciated
the
order
in
which
his
schoolfellows
had
been
named
egerton
known
as
the
caterpillar
was
the
son
of
a
guardsman
lovell
father
was
a
judge
duff
father
an
obscure
parson
the
duchess
shook
hands
with
each
boy
your
father
and
i
are
old
friends
she
said
to
egerton
and
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
uncle
she
smiled
at
john
duff
looked
unhappy
and
ill
at
ease
because
it
was
almost
certain
that
his
last
sentence
had
been
overheard
by
the
the
duchess
asked
a
few
questions
and
then
took
her
leave
she
and
her
son
were
dining
with
the
head
master
rutford
accompanied
her
did
the
blighter
hear
said
duff
how
could
he
help
it
with
his
enormous
asses
ears
said
the
tall
thin
egerton
duff
an
optimist
like
all
freckled
boys
appealed
to
the
others
each
in
turn
the
verdict
was
unanimous
he
hates
me
like
poison
said
duff
i
shall
catch
it
hot
what
an
unlucky
beggar
i
am
pooh
said
scaife
he
knows
jolly
well
that
the
whole
school
calls
him
dirty
dick
but
whatever
hopes
duff
may
have
entertained
of
his
deafness
were
speedily
laid
in
the
dust
within
five
minutes
rutford
reappeared
he
stood
in
the
doorway
glaring
just
now
duff
said
he
i
happened
to
overhear
your
voice
which
is
singularly
i
may
say
vulgarly
penetrating
you
were
speaking
of
me
your
as
but
you
used
an
adjective
before
it
what
was
it
duff
writhed
i
do
remember
oh
yes
you
do
why
lie
duff
john
brown
face
grew
pale
the
adjective
you
used
continued
rutford
was
you
spoke
of
as
dick
and
i
fancy
i
caught
the
word
you
will
write
out
if
you
please
one
hundred
greek
lines
accents
and
stops
and
bring
them
to
me
or
leave
them
with
dumbleton
lines
at
a
time
alternate
half
hour
during
the
afternoon
of
the
next
half
holiday
good
night
to
you
good
night
sir
said
all
the
boys
save
john
and
scaife
good
night
verney
master
and
pupil
confronted
each
other
john
face
looked
impassive
and
rutford
turned
from
the
new
boy
to
scaife
good
night
scaife
scaife
drew
himself
up
and
in
a
quiet
cool
voice
replied
good
night
sir
duff
waited
till
rutford
heavy
step
was
no
longer
heard
then
he
rushed
at
john
i
say
he
spluttered
you
a
good
sort
ai
he
demon
refusing
to
say
night
to
the
beast
because
he
was
ragging
me
but
never
forgive
you
never
oh
yes
he
will
said
scaife
it
wo
be
difficult
for
dirty
dick
to
forgive
the
future
verney
of
verney
boscobel
john
stared
verney
boscobel
he
repeated
why
that
belongs
to
my
uncle
mother
and
i
hope
he
marry
and
have
a
lot
of
jolly
kids
of
his
own
you
hope
he
marry
well
i
john
jaw
stuck
out
the
emphasis
on
the
hope
and
the
upraised
eyebrow
smote
hard
you
do
mean
to
say
he
began
hotly
you
do
that
i
can
think
what
i
please
said
scaife
curtly
and
so
can
you
he
laughed
derisively
what
they
please
is
about
the
only
liberty
allowed
to
new
boys
even
the
duffer
learned
to
hold
his
tongue
during
his
first
term
the
caterpillar
the
tall
thin
aristocratic
boy
spoke
solemnly
he
was
a
dandy
the
understudy
as
john
soon
discovered
of
one
of
the
bloods
a
junior
blood
or
a
tremendous
authority
on
swagger
a
stickler
for
tradition
who
had
been
nearly
three
years
in
the
school
the
demon
is
right
said
he
a
new
boy
ca
be
too
careful
verney
your
being
funny
in
hall
just
now
made
a
bad
impression
but
i
did
mean
to
be
funny
i
told
lawrence
so
directly
after
the
caterpillar
pulled
down
his
cuffs
if
you
did
mean
to
be
funny
he
concluded
you
must
be
an
ass
duff
however
remembered
that
john
was
nephew
to
an
explorer
i
say
he
jogged
john
elbow
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
your
uncle
autograph
why
of
course
said
john
thanks
i
not
a
bad
collection
the
duffer
murmured
modestly
and
the
gem
of
it
said
scaife
is
billington
the
hangman
the
duffer
shivers
whenever
he
looks
at
it
yes
i
do
said
duff
grinning
horribly
after
supper
and
prayers
john
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
for
at
least
an
hour
he
lay
awake
thinking
over
the
events
of
this
memorable
day
whenever
he
closed
his
eyes
he
beheld

objects
the
spire
of
harrow
church
and
the
vivid
laughing
face
of
desmond
he
told
himself
that
he
liked
desmond
most
awfully
and
scaife
too
the
demon
had
been
kind
but
somehow
john
did
not
like
scaife
then
in
a
curious
condition
not
yet
asleep
and
assuredly
not
quite
awake
he
seemed
to
see
the
figure
of
scaife
expanding
assuming
terrific
proportions
impending
over
desmond
standing
between
him
and
the
spire
obscuring
part
of
the
spire

first
and
then
bit
by
bit
overshadowing

whole

says
i
wish
it
to
be
buried
in

there
is
a
spot
in
the
churchyard
near
the

on
the

of
the
hill
looking
towards

a
tomb
under
a
large

bearing
the
name
of
peachie
or
peachey
where
i
used
to
sit
for
hours
and
hours
as
a
boy
this
was
my
favourite
spot
but
as
i
wish
to
erect
a

the

had
better
be

to
command
of
chapter
ii
you
come
here
where
your
brothers
came
to
the
old
school
years
ago
a
young
new
face
and
a
harrow
name
a
crowd
of
strangers
no
you
may
not
fancy
yourself
alone
you
who
are
memory
heir
when
even
the
names
in
the
graven
stone
will
greet
you
with
goes
there
you
pass
friend
all
well
john
never
forgot
that
memorable
morning
when
he
learned
for
the
first
time
what
place
he
had
taken
in
the
school
he
sat
with
the
other
staring
at
nearly
six
hundred
boys
big
and
small
assembled
together
in
the
so
engrossed
was
he
that
he
scarcely
heard
the
head
master
opening
prayers
john
was
obsessed
inebriated
with
the
number
of
harrovians
each
of
whom
had
once
felt
strange
and
shy
like
himself
from
his
place
close
to
the
great
organ
he
could
look
up
and
up
seeing
row
after
row
of
faces
knowing
that
amongst
them
sat
his
future
friends
and
foes
suddenly
a
neighbour
nudged
him
the
head
master
was
reading
from
a
list
in
his
hand
the
and
the
names
and
places
taken
by
new
boys
he
began
at
the
lowest
form
with
the
name
of
a
small
urchin
sitting
near
john
the
urchin
blinked
and
blushed
as
he
realized
that
he
was
lag
of
the
school
john
knew
that
he
had
answered
fairly
well
the
questions
set
by
the
examiners
he
had
no
fear
of
finding
himself
pilloried
in
the
third
fourth
still
as
form
after
form
did
not
include
his
name
he
grew
restless
and
excited
had
he
taken
a
higher
place
than
the
middle
shell
yes
no
verney
in
the
middle
shell
the
head
master
began
the
removes
of
the
top
shell
now
now
it
must
be
coming
no
the
clear
penetrating
tones
slowly
articulated
name
after
name
but
not
his
verney
at
last
many
eyes
were
staring
at
him
some
enviously
a
few
superciliously
john
had
taken
the
lower
remove
the
highest
form
but
one
open
to
new
boys
he
was
sipping
the
wine
called
success
moreover
desmond
of
the
frank
laughing
face
and
sparkling
blue
eyes
and
scaife
and
egerton
were
also
in
the
lower
remove
after
this
john
sat
in
a
blissful
dream
hardly
conscious
of
his
surroundings
seeing
his
mother
face
hearing
her
sigh
of
pleasure
when
she
learned
that
already
her
son
was
halfway
up
the
school
you
may
be
sure
those
first
hours
were
of
excitements
first
john
bought
his
books
stout
volumes
on
which
his
name
will
be
duly
stamped
on
and
across
the
edges
of
the
pages
and
he
bought
also
from
judy
stephens
a
squash
racquet
squash
balls
and
a
yard
ball
from
the
school
custos
titchy
a
noble
supply
of
stationery
was
procured
moreover
young
kinloch
announced
that
his
mother
had
given
him
three
pounds
to
spend
upon
the
decoration
of
no
so
scaife
declared
his
intention
of
spending
a
similar
sum
and
in
consequence
no
became
a
gorgeous
apartment
the
cynosure
of
every
eye
that
passed
the
characters
of
the
three
boys
were
revealed
plainly
enough
by
their
simple
furnishings
scaife
bought
sporting
prints
a
couple
of
détaille
lithographs
and
an
known
to
dwellers
upon
the
hill
as
a
frowst
kinloch
hung
upon
his
side
of
the
wall
four
pretty
reproductions
of
french
engravings
and
with
the
help
of
three
yards
of
velveteen
and
some
cheap
lace
he
made
a
very
passable
imitation
of
the
in
his
mother
london
boudoir
john
scorned
velveteen
lace
frowsts
and
french
engravings
he
put
his
money
into
a
pair
of
red
curtains
and
one
excellent
photogravure
of
landseer
children
of
the
mist
having
a
few
shillings
to
spare
he
bought
half
a
dozen
ferns
which
were
placed
in
a
box
by
the
window
and
watered
so
diligently
that
they
died
prematurely
secondly
john
played
in
a
at
football
and
learned
the
difference
between
a
scrimmage
at
a
small
preparatory
school
and
the
genuine
thing
at
harrow
lawrence
insisted
that
all
new
boys
should
play
and
the
caterpillar
informed
him
that
he
would
have
to
learn
the
rules
of
harrow
footer
by
heart
and
pass
a
stiff
examination
in
them
before
the
house
eleven
with
the
penalty
of
being
forced
to
sing
them
in
hall
if
he
failed
to
satisfy
his
examiners
the
duffer
lent
him
a
of
green
and
white
stripes
and
a
pair
of
white
duck
shorts
and
with
what
pride
john
put
them
on
thinking
of
the
far
distant
day
when
he
would
wear
a
fez
instead
of
the
commonplace
lawrence
said
a
few
words
you
have
to
play
the
compulsory
games
verney
which
begin
after
the
goose
match
but
i
want
to
see
you
playing
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
in
the
you
be
knocked
about
a
bit
but
a
verney
wo
mind
that
eh
rather
not
said
john
feeling
very
valiant
thirdly
there
was
the
first
sunday
and
the
first
sermon
of
the
head
master
with
its
plain
teaching
about
the
opportunities
and
perils
of
public
school
life
john
found
himself
mightily
affected
by
the
singing
and
the
absence
of
shrill
treble
voices
the
booming
basses
and
baritones
of
the
big
fellows
made
him
shiver
with
a
curious
sensation
never
experienced
before
lastly
the
pleasant
discovery
that
his
form
treated
him
with
courtesy
and
kindness
desmond
in
particular
welcomed
him
quite
warmly
and
then
and
there
john
heart
was
filled
with
a
wild
and
unreasonable
yearning
for
this
boy
friendship
but
desmond
he
was
called
cæsar
because
his
christian
names
were
henry
julius
seemed
to
be
very
popular
a
bright
particular
star
far
beyond
john
reach
although
for
ever
in
his
sight
cæsar
never
offered
to
walk
with
him
and
he
refused
john
timid
invitation
to
have
food
at
the
tudor
creameries
was
it
possible
that
a
boy
about
to
enter
damer
would
not
be
seen
walking
and
talking
with
a
fellow
out
of
dirty
dick
this
possibility
festered
till
one
morning
john
saw
his
idol
walking
up
and
down
the
school
yard
with
scaife
that
evening
he
said
to
scaife
do
you
like
desmond
yes
scaife
replied
decisively
i
like
him
better
than
any
fellow
at
harrow
you
know
that
his
father
is
charles
desmond
the
cabinet
minister
and
a
governor
of
the
school
i
did
know
it
i
suppose
cæsar
desmond
likes
you
do
you
i
doubt
it
no
more
was
said
john
told
himself
that
cæsar
he
liked
to
think
of
desmond
as
cæsar
could
pick
and
choose
a
pal
out
of
at
least
three
hundred
boys
half
the
school
how
extremely
unlikely
that
he
john
would
be
chosen
but
every
night
he
lay
awake
for
half
an
hour
longer
than
he
ought
to
have
done
wondering
how
by
hook
or
crook
he
could
do
a
service
to
cæsar
which
must
challenge
interest
and
provoke
ultimately
friendship
meantime
he
was
slowly
initiated
by
the
caterpillar
into
harrow
ways
and
customs
fagging
which
began
after
the
first
fortnight
he
found
a
not
unpleasant
duty
after
first
and
fourth
schools
the
other
fags
and
he
would
stand
not
far
from
the
pantry
and
yell
out
breakfast
or
tea
as
it
might
be
for
number
perhaps
one
had
to
nip
up
to
the
creameries
to
get
a
slice
of
salmon
or
cutlets
or
sausages
fagging
at
harrow
which
varies
slightly
in
different
houses
is
hard
or
easy
according
to
the
taste
and
fancy
of
the
fag
master
some
of
the
sixth
form
at
the
manor
made
their
fags
unlace
their
dirty
football
boots
kinloch
who
since
he
left
the
nursery
had
been
waited
upon
by
powdered
footmen
six
feet
high
now
found
to
his
disgust
that
he
had
to
varnish
trieve
for
sunday
trieve
was
second
in
command
and
had
been
known
as
miss
trieve
john
would
have
gladly
done
this
and
more
for
lawrence
his
but
lawrence
a
manly
youth
scorned
sybaritic
services
the
caterpillar
taught
john
to
carry
his
umbrella
unfolded
to
wear
his
straw
straight
a
slight
list
to
port
was
allowed
to
bloods
only
not
to
walk
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
so
forth
how
he
used
to
envy
the
members
of
the
elevens
as
they
rolled
down
the
high
street
how
often
he
wondered
if
the
day
would
ever
dawn
when
cæsar
and
he
outwardly
and
inwardly
linked
together
would
stroll
up
and
down
the
below
the
chapel
terrace
that
sunny
walk
whence
on
a
fair
day
you
can
see
the
insatiable
monster
london
filling
the
horizon
and
stretching
red
reeking
hands
into
the
sweet
country
the
from
which
all
but
bloods
were
rigidly
excluded
much
to
his
annoyance
an
annoyance
be
it
said
which
he
managed
to
hide
john
seemed
to
attract
young
kinloch
almost
as
magnetically
as
he
himself
was
attracted
to
cæsar
john
had
not
the
heart
to
shake
off
the
frail
delicate
child
who
was
christened
fluff
after
his
first
appearance
in
public
fluff
had
taken
the
first
fourth
and
ingenuously
confessed
to
any
one
who
cared
to
listen
that
he
ought
to
have
gone
to
eton
a
beast
of
a
doctor
prescribed
the
hill
and
even
the
almighty
duke
failed
to
get
him
into
damer
another
grievance
he
had
been
entered
since
birth
at
the
crack
house
at
eton
and
now
to
be
pitchforked
into
dirty
dick
at
harrow
the
duffer
kicked
him
feeling
an
unspeakable
cad
when
poor
fluff
burst
into
tears
sorry
said
the
duffer
only
you
must
slang
harrow
and
better
get
it
into
your
silly
head
that
it
the
best
school
in
this
or
any
other
world
is
it
demon
i
sure
the
verneys
and
the
egertons
and
the
duffs
have
always
thought
so
but
it
is
really
whimpered
poor
fluff
you
fellows
know
that
everybody
talks
of
eton
and
harrow
who
ever
heard
of
harrow
and
eton
people
say
i
heard
my
eldest
brother
strathpeffer
say
it
again
and
again
and
harrow
just
as
they
say
and
players
oh
said
the
caterpillar
the
etonians
are
the
gentlemen
eh
well
fluff
after
their
performance
at
lord
last
year
you
could
expect
us
to
admit
that
they
players
the
duffer
chuckled
i
say
caterpillar
that
was
a
good
not
mine
said
the
caterpillar
solemnly
my
governor
you
know
the
duffer
continued
now
fluff
i
wo
touch
your
body
because
you
might
tumble
to
pieces
but
if
i
hear
you
slanging
the
school
or
our
house
i
pull
out
handfuls
of
fluff
d
hear
yes
said
fluff
meekly
say
on
your
bended
knees
fluff
obeyed
and
remember
said
the
duffer
impressively
that
we
had
a
king
here
have
we
caterpillar
yes
said
the
caterpillar
i
never
believed
it
said
scaife
he
was
a
spaniard
or
an
italian
you
know
the
duffer
explained
the
duke
of
something
or
and
an
ambassador
came
down
and
offered
the
beggar
the
spanish
crown
when
he
was
in
the
first
fourth
and
of
course
he
gobbled
it
who
would
and
then
victor
emmanuel
interfered
that
all
true
you
can
take
your
bible
oath
because
my
governor
told
me
so
and
he
well
he
a
parson
then
it
be
true
said
scaife
now
young
fluff
do
forget
that
harrow
is
a
school
fit
for
a
king
and
nearer
to
heaven
than
eton
by
at
least
six
hundred
feet
so
saying
the
demon
marched
out
of
the
room
followed
by
fluff
slightly
limping
sorry
i
turfed
that
little
ass
so
hard
said
the
duffer
to
john
i
say
verney
the
demon
is
rather
a
rum
ai
he
sometimes
i
quite
make
him
out
he
frightfully
clever
and
all
that
but
i
had
a
sort
of
beastly
feeling
just
now
that
he
did
eh
quite
mean
what
he
said
was
he
laughin
at
pullin
our
legs
what
john
brain
worked
slowly
as
he
had
found
out
to
his
cost
under
a
who
maintained
that
it
was
no
use
having
a
fact
stored
in
the
head
unless
it
slipped
readily
out
of
the
mouth
the
duffer
who
never
thought
because
speaking
was
so
much
easier
grew
impatient
at
john
silence
well
you
need
look
like
an
owl
verney
you
know
that
grandfather
was
a
navvy
i
do
know
john
replied
and
i
do
care
said
the
duffer
let
go
and
have
some
food
at
the
creameries
looking
back
afterwards
john
often
wondered
whether
unconsciously
the
duffer
had
sown
a
grain
of
destined
to
grow
into
a
large
tree
or
had
the
intuition
that
scaife
was
other
than
what
he
seemed
furnished
the
fertile
soil
into
which
the
seed
fell
in
any
case
from
the
end
of
this
first
week
began
to
increase
the
suspicion
which
eventually
became
conviction
that
the
demon
keen
at
games
popular
in
his
house
clever
at
work
clever
indeed
inasmuch
as
he
never
achieved
more
or
less
than
was
necessary
generous
with
his
money
handsome
and
blessed
in
fine
with
so
many
gifts
of
the
gods
yet
lacked
a
soul
this
of
course
is
putting
into
words
the
vague
speculations
and
reasonings
of
a
boy
not
yet
fourteen
if
an
olympian
one
of
the
masters
for
instance
or
the
head
of
the
house
had
said
verney
has
the
demon
a
soul
john
would
have
answered
promptly
ra
ther
been
awfully
decent
to
fluff
and
me
we
have
had
a
hot
time
if
it
had
been
for
him
and
so
forth
and
indeed
to
doubt
sincerity
and
goodness
seemed
at
times
gross
disloyalty
because
he
stood
firm
as
a
rock
between
the
two
urchins
in
his
room
and
the
turbulent
crowd
outside
this
defence
of
the
weak
this
guarding
of
green
fruit
from
the
maw
of
lower
school
boys
afforded
scaife
an
opportunity
of
exercising
power
he
had
the
instincts
of
the
potter
inherited
no
doubt
and
he
moulded
the
clay
ready
to
his
hand
with
the
delight
of
a
nobody
else
knew
what
the
man
of
millions
had
said
to
his
boy
when
he
despatched
him
to
harrow
but
the
demon
remembered
every
word
he
had
reason
to
respect
and
fear
his
sire
i
sending
you
to
harrow
to
study
not
books
nor
games
but
boys
who
will
be
men
when
you
are
a
man
and
above
all
study
their
weaknesses
look
for
the
flaws
teach
yourself
to
recognize
at
a
glance
the
liar
the
humbug
the
fool
the
egotist
and
the
mule
make
friends
with
as
many
as
are
likely
to
help
you
in
after
life
and
do
forget
that
one
enemy
may
inflict
a
greater
injury
than
twenty
friends
can
repair
spend
money
freely
dress
well
swim
with
the
tide
not
against
it
a
year
at
harrow
confirmed
scaife
confidence
in
his
father
worldly
wisdom
big
for
his
age
strong
with
his
grandsire
muscles
tough
as
hickory
he
had
become
the
leader
of
the
lower
school
boys
at
the
manor
the
fifth
were
civil
to
him
recognizing
perhaps
the
expediency
of
leaving
him
alone
ever
since
the
incident
of
the
cricket
stump
the
sixth
found
him
the
quickest
of
the
fags
and
uncommonly
obliging
his
signed
reports
which
neither
praised
nor
blamed
to
dirty
dick
the
boy
was
the
son
of
a
man
who
could
write
a
cheque
for
a
million
two
things
worthy
of
record
happened
within
a
month
the
one
of
lesser
importance
can
be
set
down
first
charles
desmond
cæsar
father
came
down
to
harrow
and
gave
a
luncheon
at
the
king
head
from
time
immemorial
the
desmonds
had
been
educated
on
the
hill
the
family
had
produced
some
famous
soldiers
a
lord
chancellor
and
a
prime
minister
in
the
fourth
form
room
the
stranger
may
read
their
names
carved
in
oak
and
they
are
carved
also
in
the
hearts
of
all
ardent
harrovians
desmond
though
a
cabinet
minister
found
time
to
visit
harrow
once
at
least
in
each
term
he
always
chose
a
whole
holiday
and
after
attending
bill
in
the
yard
would
carry
off
his
son
and
his
son
friends
the
school
knew
him
and
loved
him
to
the
thoughtful
he
stood
for
the
illustrious
past
the
epitome
of
what
john
lyon
boys
had
fought
for
and
accomplished
four
sons
had
he
harrovians
all
of
these
cæsar
was
youngest
and
last
each
had
distinguished
himself
on
the
hill
either
in
work
or
play
or
in
both
charles
desmond
stood
upon
the
step
just
above
the
master
who
was
calling
bill
that
cæsar
father
said
scaife
i
going
to
lunch
with
him
is
he
a
topper
john
eyes
were
popping
out
of
his
face
he
had
never
seen
any
man
like
this
resplendent
stately
personage
smiling
and
nodding
to
the
biggest
fellows
in
the
school
and
my
governor
says
scaife
added
that
he
not
a
rich
man
nothing
much
to
speak
of
in
the
way
of
income
over
and
above
his
screw
as
a
cabinet
minister
scaife
moved
away
and
john
could
hear
him
say
to
another
boy
in
an
easy
friendly
tone
desmond
told
cæsar
that
he
wanted
to
meet
very
civil
of
him
eh
presently
john
was
in
line
waiting
to
pass
by
the
steps
verney
here
sir
he
was
hurrying
by
with
a
backward
glance
at
the
great
man
suddenly
cæsar
father
beckoned
nodding
cheerily
john
ascended
the
steps
to
feel
the
grasp
of
a
strong
hand
to
hear
a
ringing
voice
you
john
verney
nephew
just
so
i
think
i
should
have
spotted
you
even
if
harry
had
not
told
me
you
were
in
his
form
you
must
lunch
with
us
cut
along
now
so
john
was
dismissed
of
happiness
which
almost
overflowed
when
cæsar
met
him
with
an
eager
i
so
glad
verney
i
say
the
governor
a
nailer
at
picking
out
the
old
names
is
he
so
john
ate
his
luncheon
in
distinguished
company
and
felt
himself
for
the
first
time
to
be
somebody
as
the
youngest
guest
present
to
him
was
accorded
the
place
of
honour
next
the
most
charming
host
in
christendom
who
put
him
at
ease
in
a
jiffy
how
good
the
cutlets
and
the
pheasant
tasted
and
how
the
talk
warmed
the
cockles
of
his
heart
the
brand
of
the
crossed
arrows
shone
upon
all
topics
who
could
expect
or
desire
aught
else
cæsar
governor
seemed
to
know
what
every
harrovian
had
done
worth
the
doing
easily
fluently
he
discoursed
of
triumphs
won
at
home
abroad
in
the
camp
on
the
hustings
at
the
bar
in
the
pulpit
and
his
anecdotes
which
illustrated
every
phase
of
life
how
pat
to
the
moment
they
were
one
boy
complained
ruefully
of
having
spent
three
terms
under
a
who
had
ragged
him
charles
desmond
sympathized
bless
my
soul
said
he
do
i
remember
being
three
terms
in
the
third
fifth
when
that
tartar
old
heriot
had
it
i
dare
swear
i
got
no
more
than
my
deserts
i
was
an
idle
vagabond
but
heriot
made
my
life
such
a
burden
to
me
that
i
entreated
my
people
to
take
me
away
from
harrow
and
then
my
governor
urged
me
to
put
my
back
into
the
work
and
get
a
remove
and
i
did
and
would
you
believe
it
upon
the
first
day
of
the
next
term
i
wired
to
my
people
must
take
me
away
i
got
my
remove
all
right
and
so
has
heriot
how
gaily
the
speaker
led
the
laugh
which
followed
this
recital
and
the
chaff
was
it
possible
that
cæsar
dared
to
chaff
a
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
the
peace
of
europe
in
his
keeping
and
by
jove
cæsar
could
hold
his
own
so
the
minutes
flew
but
john
noticed
with
surprise
that
the
demon
did
score
in
fact
john
and
he
were
the
only
guests
that
contributed
nothing
to
the
feast
save
hearty
appetites
it
was
strange
that
the
demon
the
wit
of
his
house
and
form
never
opened
his
mouth
except
to
fill
it
with
food
he
answered
it
is
true
and
very
modestly
the
questions
addressed
to
him
by
his
host
but
then
as
john
reflected
any
silly
fool
in
the
fourth
form
could
do
that
after
luncheon
the
boys
were
dismissed
each
with
a
hearty
word
of
encouragement
and
half
a
sovereign
john
was
passing
the
splendours
of
the
creameries
when
the
demon
overtook
him
and
they
walked
down
the
winding
high
street
together
scaife
had
never
walked
with
john
before
that
was
worth
while
scaife
said
quietly
john
could
not
interpret
this
speech
save
in
its
obvious
meaning
rather
he
replied
why
said
scaife
very
sharply
eh
why
was
it
worth
while
john
stammered
out
something
about
good
food
and
jolly
talk
pooh
said
scaife
contemptuously
i
thought
you
had
brains
verney
he
glanced
at
him
keenly
now
speak
out
what
in
that
head
of
yours
you
can
be
cheeky
if
you
like
john
wondered
how
scaife
had
divined
that
he
wished
to
be
cheeky
his
mentor
had
said
so
much
to
fluff
and
him
about
the
propriety
of
not
putting
on
lift
or
side
in
the
presence
of
an
older
boy
that
he
had
choked
back
a
retort
which
occurred
to
him
you
thinking
continued
the
demon
in
his
clear
voice
that
i
did
use
my
brains
just
now
but
my
blooming
innocent
i
can
assure
you
i
did
very
much
so
i
played
put
that
into
your
little
pipe
and
smoke
it
at
bill
john
noticed
cæsar
absence
a
fact
accounted
for
by
the
presence
of
a
which
he
knew
belonged
to
desmond
drawn
up
oddly
enough
opposite
the
manor
what
a
joke
to
think
that
cæsar
was
drinking
tea
with
dirty
dick
after
bill
having
nothing
better
to
do
john
and
fluff
went
for
a
walk
on
the
sudbury
road
they
had
played
football
before
bill
and
each
had
realized
his
own
awkwardness
and
insignificance
poor
fluff
almost
reduced
to
tears
with
a
big
black
bruise
upon
his
white
forehead
confessed
that
he
preferred
peaceful
games
like
croquet
and
intended
to
apply
for
a
doctor
certificate
of
exemption
demanding
sympathy
he
received
a
slating
i
play
nearly
as
rotten
a
game
as
you
do
fluff
john
said
but
scaife
expects
us
to
be
torpids
so
we
jolly
well
have
to
buck
up
that
bruise
over
your
eye
has
taken
off
your
look
now
if
you
going
to
blub
you
better
get
behind
that
hedge
fluff
exploded
this
is
a
beastly
hole
he
cried
and
i
loathe
it
i
going
to
write
to
my
father
and
beg
him
to
take
me
away
you
ought
to
be
at
a
girls
school
i
hate
everything
and
everybody
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
the
only
friend
i
had
john
was
somewhat
mollified
i
am
your
friend
but
not
when
you
talk
rot
verney
look
here
if
you
be
decent
to
me
i
try
to
stick
it
out
i
wish
i
was
like
you
i
do
indeed
i
wish
i
was
like
scaife
why
i
sooner
be
the
duffer
freckles
and
all
than
myself
john
looked
down
upon
the
face
the
small
regular
girlish
features
the
red
quivering
mouth
suddenly
he
grasped
that
this
was
an
appeal
from
weakness
to
strength
and
that
he
no
older
and
but
a
little
bigger
than
fluff
had
strength
to
spare
strength
to
shoulder
burdens
other
than
his
own
all
right
he
said
stiffly
do
make
such
a
fuss
you
have
me
for
a
friend
verney
yes
but
i
ai
going
to
kiss
your
forehead
to
make
it
well
you
know
may
i
call
you
john
when
we
alone
and
i
wish
you
call
me
esmé
instead
of
that
horrid
john
pondered
deeply
look
here
he
said
you
can
call
me
john
and
i
call
you
esmé
when
we
torpids
and
now
you
better
cut
back
to
the
house
i
must
think
this
all
out
and
i
ca
think
straight
when
i
look
at
you
may
i
call
you
john
once
you
are
the
silliest
idiot
i
ever
met
bar
none
call
me
or
fool
or
anything
but
hook
it
afterwards
yes
john
i
will
you
the
only
boy
i
ever
met
whom
i
really
wanted
for
a
friend
he
displayed
a
radiant
face
turned
suddenly
and
ran
off
john
watched
him
frowning
because
fluff
was
a
good
little
chap
and
yet
at
times
such
a
bore
he
walked
on
alone
chewing
the
cud
of
a
delightful
experience
trying
not
unsuccessfully
to
recall
some
of
desmond
anecdotes
how
proud
cæsar
was
of
his
father
and
the
father
obviously
was
just
as
proud
of
his
son
what
a
pair
and
if
only
cæsar
were
his
friend
by
jove
it
was
rather
a
rum
go
but
john
was
as
mad
keen
to
call
cæsar
friend
as
poor
fluff
to
call
john
friend
serious
food
for
thought
this
but
i
would
never
bother
him
said
john
to
himself
as
fluff
has
bothered
me
never
hullo
verney
hullo
said
john
coincidence
had
thrust
cæsar
out
of
his
thought
and
on
to
the
narrow
path
in
front
of
him
i
not
a
ghost
said
cæsar
john
hesitated
i
was
thinking
of
you
he
confessed
and
then
i
heard
your
voice
and
saw
you
it
gave
me
a
start
i
say
it
good
of
your
governor
to
ask
me
hang
my
governor
he
the
cæsar
closed
his
lips
firmly
as
if
he
feared
that
terrible
adjectives
might
burst
from
them
john
missed
the
sparkling
smile
the
gay
glance
of
the
eyes
what
up
he
demanded
cæsar
hesitated
looked
at
john
read
perhaps
the
sympathy
the
honest
interest
possibly
the
affection
in
the
grey
orbs
which
met
his
own
so
steadily
what
up
he
repeated
why
i
not
going
into
damer
after
all
oh
said
john
my
governor
has
just
told
me
i
came
down
here
to
curse
and
swear
not
going
into
damer
what
rot
for
you
it
is
sickening
look
here
verney
i
feel
like
telling
you
about
it
i
know
you
wo
go
bleating
all
over
the
shop
no
i
said
to
myself
the
word
but
john
heart
beat
his
body
glowed
his
grey
eyes
sparkled
it
like
this
continued
cæsar
after
a
slight
pause
damer
told
the
governor
that
two
fellows
he
had
expected
to
leave
at
the
end
of
this
term
were
staying
on
the
governor
hinted
that
damer
added
something
about
straining
a
point
and
letting
me
in
ahead
of
three
other
fellows
but
the
governor
would
listen
to
that
jolly
decent
of
him
said
john
was
it
in
my
opinion
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
me
first
all
my
brothers
have
been
at
damer
and
he
knew
i
set
my
heart
on
going
there
look
how
civil
the
fellows
are
to
me
i
been
in
and
out
of
the
house
like
a
tame
cat
confound
it
if
damer
did
want
to
strain
a
point
why
should
he
the
governor
played
his
own
game
not
mine
what
right
has
he
to
be
so
precious
unselfish
at
my
expense
i
argued
with
him
but
he
can
put
his
foot
down
let
cut
all
that
of
course
i
do
want
to
stop
in
a
beastly
small
house
for
ever
and
if
damer
is
closed
to
me
i
should
like
brown
but
brown
is
full
too
and
there
are
other
good
houses
but
where
where
do
you
think
i
going
reeds
i
do
call
reed
so
bad
no
i
going
to
dirty
dick
i
coming
to
you
oh
i
say
why
dash
it
all
you
grinning
i
do
want
to
be
a
cad
dirty
dick
is
house
but
after
damer
o
lord
the
grin
faded
out
of
john
face
cæsar
loss
outweighed
his
own
gain
your
governor
was
a
manorite
he
said
slowly
yes
in
its
best
days
and
he
always
had
a
sneaking
liking
for
it
but
he
knows
he
knows
i
say
that
now
it
rotten
and
yet
he
sends
me
there
why
ask
another
said
john
i
asked
him
another
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
in
that
peculiar
voice
of
his
which
always
dries
me
up
said
he
you
a
little
older
and
a
good
deal
wiser
you
be
able
to
answer
that
question
yourself
john
face
brightened
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
shone
out
of
the
darkness
he
tried
to
advance
nearer
to
it
gropingly
i
dare
say
well
go
on
your
governor
may
feel
that
we
want
a
fellow
like
you
john
was
blushing
because
he
remembered
what
the
head
of
the
house
had
said
about
the
verneys
desmond
glanced
at
him
keenly
he
detested
flattery
laid
on
too
thick
but
this
was
a
genuine
tribute
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
thank
you
verney
he
said
more
genially
what
you
say
is
utter
rot
but
it
was
decent
of
you
to
say
it
and
i
glad
that
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
in
the
same
house
for
his
life
john
could
not
help
adding
and
scaife
you
forget
scaife
jealousy
pierced
him
as
scaife
name
slipped
out
yes
there
the
demon
i
always
liked
him
and
he
likes
you
does
he
good
old
demon
i
like
to
be
liked
that
the
irish
in
me
i
half
irish
you
know
i
want
fellows
to
be
friendly
to
me
forgotten
scaife
that
rum
too
because
he
not
the
sort
one
forgets
is
he
no
i
wonder
if
i
could
get
into
the
demon
room
next
term
i
in
his
room
it
a
a
is
much
jollier
our
room
is
not
bad
cæsar
was
hardly
listening
john
caught
a
murmur
the
old
demon
and
i
would
get
along

john
verney
learned
what
had
passed
between

minister
and
head
master
upon
that
eventful
day
which
sent
cæsar
to
curse
and
swear
upon
the

road
the
head
master
was
not
an
harrovian
and
on
that
account
was
the
better
able
to
perceive
abuses
at

chord
among

sentimental
and
then
strenuousness
pushes
it
into
a
corner
when
honoured
veterans
are
wearing
out
loyalty
gratitude
for
past
service
reluctance
to
inflict
pain
keep
them
in
positions
of
responsibility
which
mentally
and
physically
they
are
unfit
to
administer
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
turn
an
eton
or
harrow
master
out
of
his
house
as
to
turn
a
parson
of
the
church
of
england
out
of
his
pulpit
more
in
selecting
a

in
selecting
a
parson
a
man
claims
to
preferment
are
too
often
determined
by
scholarship
by
length
of
former
service
by
interest
with
authority
rather
than
by
ability
to
govern

of
boys
made
up
of

prove
an
incapable
richard
rutford
to
give
a
concrete
example
came
to
harrow
knowing
nothing
about
public
schools
and
caring
as
little
for
the
traditions
of
the
hill
but
with
the
prestige
of
being
a
senior
classic
nobody
questioned
his
ability
to
teach
greek
in
his
own
line
and
not
an
inch
beyond
the
governors
were
assured
that
rutford
was
a
success
in
due
time
he
accepted
a
small
house
so
small
that
its
autocrat
incapacity
as
an
administrator
escaped
notice
rutford
waited
patiently
for
a
big
morsel
he
wrote
a
couple
of
he
married
a
wife
with
money
and
influence
he
entertained
handsomely
it
is
true
he
became
popular
neither
with
masters
nor
boys
but
his
wine
was
as
sound
as
his
scholarship
and
his
wife
had
a
peer
for
a
second
cousin
eventually
he
accepted
the
manor
within
a
month
those
in
authority
suspected
that
a
blunder
had
been
made
within
a
year
they
knew
it
the
house
began
to
go
down
leaven
lay
in
the
lump
but
not
enough
to
make
it
rise
because
the
baker
refused
to
stir
the
dough
first
and
last
rutford
disliked
boys
misunderstood
them
insulted
them
ignored
those
who
lacked
influential
connections
toadied
and
pampered
the
swells
just
before
john
verney
came
to
harrow
the
manor
was
showing
unmistakable
signs
of
decay
a
new
head
master
recognizing
realizing
the
necessity
of
cutting
it
out
was
confronted
with
that
bristling
obstacle
tradition
he
possessed
enough
moral
courage
to
have
told
rutford
to
resign
because
in
a
thousand
indescribable
ways
the
man
had
neglected
his
duty
but
so
said
the
tories
such
a
step
might
provoke
a
public
scandal
and
if
rutford
refused
to
go
what
then
nothing
definite
could
be
proved
against
the
man
his
sins
had
been
of
omission
dismayed
not
defeated
the
head
master
considered
other
methods
of
regenerating
the
manor
very
quietly
he
made
his
appeal
to
the
old
harrovians
many
of
whom
were
sending
their
sons
and
nephews
to
other
houses
he
invited
john
verney
the
rev
septimus
duff
colonel
egerton
half
a
dozen
enthusiastic
manorites
stepped
forward
lastly
for
charles
desmond
the
head
master
baited
his
hook
the
reform
which
we
have
at
heart
said
he
must
come
from
within
and
from
below
the
house
wants
a
desmond
in
it
i
was
not
allowed
to
wield
the
axe
but
after
all
there
are
more
modern
methods
of
decapitation
and
believe
me
i
am
not
asking
any
man
more
than
i
am
prepared
to
do
myself
my
own
nephew
goes
to
the
manor
after
next
holidays
um
said
desmond
stroking
his
chin
lawrence
the
head
of
the
house
is
a
tower
of
strength
like
all
the
lawrences
how
did
you
beguile
the
duke
of
trent
fortune
gave
me
that
weapon
the
duke
he
laughed
genially
yes
will
turn
scales
which
my
heaviest
arguments
wo
budge
a
bit
of
luck
the
duke
wanted
to
send
his
son
a
delicate
lad
to
harrow
and
i
did
mention
to
him
that
rutford
had
a
vacancy
o
ulysses
and
scaife
how
did
you
handle
that
large
bale
of
rutford
captured
scaife
handsome
boy
his
son
lunched
with
us
this
morning
well
well
you
have
persuaded
me
but
what
an
unpleasant
quarter
of
an
hour
i
shall
have
with
harry
as
a
new
boy
john
slaved
at
footer
and
displayed
a
curious
inaptitude
for
squash
racquets
at
all
games
cæsar
and
scaife
were
precociously
proficient
john
clumsiness
annoyed
them
often
the
caterpillar
joined
him
and
fluff
giving
them
to
understand
that
this
must
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
grace
and
condescension
which
might
be
suitably
acknowledged
at
the
tudor
creameries
the
caterpillar
mightily
impressed
the
two
small
boys
he
had
acquired
his
from
the
very
leisurely
pace
at
which
he
advanced
up
the
school
he
wore
charity
tails
as
they
were
called
the
coat
of
the
upper
school
mercifully
given
to
boys
of
the
lower
school
who
are
too
tall
to
wear
with
decency
the
short
eton
jacket
he
possessed
a
and
his
bags
were
perfectly
creased
and
quite
spotless
from
tip
to
toe
at
all
seasons
and
in
all
weathers
he
looked
conspicuously
spick
and
span
chaff
provoked
the
solemn
retort
one
should
be
well
groomed
he
spoke
impersonally
considering
it
bad
form
to
use
for
first
person
singular
amongst
the
small
boys
he
ranked
as
the
petronius
of
the
lower
school
one
day
the
caterpillar
said
grandiloquently
you
kids
will
oblige
me
by
not
shouting
and
yelling
when
you
speak
to
me
i
a
bit
of
a
head
what
wrong
with
it
said
fluff
it
looks
splendid
said
john
in
his
serious
voice
the
caterpillar
detecting
no
cheek
answered
gravely
some
of
us
had
a
wet
night
of
it
last
night
wet
exclaimed
the
innocent
fluff
why
all
the
stars
were
shining
your
brothers
at
eton
know
what
a
night
means
said
the
caterpillar
i
was
talking
with
one
of
the
fifth
when
a
fellow
came
in
with
a
flask
a
gentleman
ought
to
be
able
to
carry
a
few
glasses
of
wine
but
one
is
not
accustomed
to
spirits
spirits
whisky
not
prussic
acid
you
know
but
where
do
they
get
the
whisky
demanded
john
comparing
it
with
my
father
old
scotch
i
should
say
at
the
grocer
replied
the
caterpillar
there
some
drinking
going
on
in
our
house
and
and
other
things
one
mentions
it
to
you
kids
as
a
warning
thanks
said
john
not
at
all
you
rather
decent
little
beggars
they
the
fifth
form
was
indicated
they
let
you
alone
so
far
but
you
may
have
trouble
next
term
so
look
out
and
if
you
want
advice
come
to
me
beneath
his
absurd
pompous
manner
beat
a
kindly
heart
and
the
small
boys
divined
this
and
were
grateful
none
the
less
the
word
spirits
frightened
them
next
day
john
happened
to
find
himself
alone
with
cæsar
very
nervously
he
asked
the
question
i
say
do
any
of
the
big
fellows
at
damer
drink
drink
drink
what
well
spirits
cæsar
snorted
an
indignant
denial
the
fellows
at
damer
were
above
that
sort
of
thing
the
house
prided
itself
upon
its
tone
tone
constituted
damer
glory
and
was
the
secret
of
its
success
john
nodded
but
two
days
afterwards
the
demon
took
him
by
the
arm
twisted
it
sharply
and
said
what
the
deuce
did
you
mean
by
telling
cæsar
that
the
manorites
drink
oh
scaife
i
did
you
gave
us
away
john
eyes
opened
do
drink
with
he
faltered
do
bother
your
head
about
what
i
do
or
do
do
scaife
answered
roughly
and
because
you
took
the
lower
remove
do
think
for
an
instant
that
you
are
on
a
par
with
cæsar
and
me
or
even
the
old
caterpillar
for
you
ai
i
know
that
said
john
humbly
do
forget
it
or
there
may
be
ructions
i
sha
forget
it
that
right
and
by
the
way
you
getting
into
the
habit
of
hanging
about
cæsar
which
bores
him
to
death
stop
it
but
to
this
john
made
no
reply
he
read
dislike
in
scaife
bold
eyes
detected
it
in
his
clear
peremptory
voice
felt
it
in
the
cruel
twist
of
the
arm
and
he
had
brains
enough
to
know
that
scaife
was
not
the
boy
to
dislike
any
one
without
reason
john
crawled
to
the
conclusion
that
scaife
had
become
jealous
of
his
increasing
intimacy
with
desmond
however
when
the
three
boys
were
preparing
their
greek
for
first
school
scaife
seemed
his
old
self
friendly
amusing
and
cool
as
a
cucumber
long
ago
he
had
initiated
john
into
manorite
methods
of
work
our
object
is
he
explained
to
the
new
boy
to
get
through
the
with
as
little
squandering
of
valuable
time
as
possible
it
does
pay
to
be
skewed
we
must
mug
up
our
well
enough
to
scrape
along
without
and
extra
school
the
three
out
of
forty
lines
of
vergil
scaife
would
be
fifteen
john
fifteen
and
the
caterpillar
ten
because
as
he
pointed
out
he
had
been
nearly
three
years
in
the
school
then
each
fellow
in
turn
construed
his
lines
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
a
difficult
passage
was
taken
by
scaife
to
a
clever
friend
in
the
fifth
sometimes
scaife
would
be
absent
twenty
minutes
returning
flushed
of
face
and
slightly
excited
john
wondered
if
he
had
been
drinking
and
wondered
also
what
cæsar
would
say
if
he
knew
about
this
time
fear
possessed
his
soul
that
cæsar
would
come
into
the
manor
and
be
taught
by
scaife
to
drink
an
occasional
nightmare
took
the
form
of
a
desperate
struggle
between
himself
and
scaife
in
which
scaife
by
virtue
of
superior
strength
and
skill
had
the
mastery
dragging
off
the
beloved
cæsar
to
plunge
with
him
into
fathomless
pools
of
scotch
whisky
somehow
in
these
horrid
dreams
cæsar
played
an
impressive
part
scaife
and
john
fought
for
his
body
while
he
looked
on
an
absurd
state
of
affairs
never
as
john
reflected
in
his
waking
hours
likely
to
happen
in
real
life
of
all
boys
cæsar
seemed
to
be
the
best
equipped
to
fight
his
own
battles
and
to
take
as
he
would
have
put
it
jolly
good
care
of
himself
after
the
first
of
the
football
scaife
got
his
fez
from
lawrence
the
captain
of
the
house
eleven
and
the
only
member
of
the
school
eleven
in
dirty
dick
some
of
the
big
fellows
in
the
fifth
seized
this
opportunity
to
celebrate
as
they
called
it
scaife
was
popular
with
the
fifth
because
as
john
discovered
later
he
cheerfully
lent
money
to
some
of
them
and
never
pressed
for
repayment
and
scaife
getting
his
fez
before
he
was
fifteen
might
be
reckoned
an
achievement
cæsar
in
particular
could
talk
of
nothing
else
he
predicted
that
the
demon
would
be
captain
of
both
elevens
school
and
bloom
into
a
second
fry
john
upon
this
eventful
evening
soon
became
aware
of
a
shindy
it
happened
that
rutford
was
giving
a
and
extremely
unlikely
to
leave
the
private
side
of
the
house
john
heard
snatches
of
song
howls
and
cheers
ordinarily
lawrence
in
whose
passage
the
shindy
was
taking
place
would
have
stopped
this
hullabaloo
but
lawrence
was
dining
with
his
and
trieve
an
undersized
weakly
stripling
lacked
the
moral
courage
to
interfere
john
was
getting
a
con
from
trieve
when
an
unusually
piercing
howl
penetrated
the
august
seclusion
what
they
doing
asked
trieve
irritably
john
hesitated
it
the
fifth
he
blurted
out
they
got
scaife
in
there
you
know
oh
indeed
scaife
is
an
excuse
is
he
for
this
fiendish
row
go
and
tell
scaife
i
want
to
see
him
john
looked
rather
frightened
he
felt
like
a
spaniel
about
to
retrieve
a
lion
and
scurrying
along
the
passage
he
ran
headlong
into
the
duffer
to
whom
he
explained
his
errand
said
that
young
gentleman
i
sooner
it
was
you
than
me
verney
they
pretty
well
i
can
tell
you
john
tapped
timidly
at
the
door
of
the
room
whence
the
songs
and
laughter
proceeded
then
he
tapped
again
and
again
finally
summoning
his
courage
he
rapped
hard
instantly
there
was
silence
and
then
a
furtive
rustling
of
papers
followed
by
a
constrained
come
in
john
entered
most
of
the
boys
there
were
about
six
of
them
gazed
at
him
in
stupefaction
scaife
very
red
in
the
face
burst
into
shrill
shouts
of
laughter
somehow
the
laughter
disconcerted
john
he
forgot
to
deliver
his
message
but
stood
staring
at
scaife
quaking
with
a
young
terror
of
the
unknown
upon
the
table
were
some
siphons
syrups
and
the
remains
of
a
spread
what
the
blazes
do
you
want
said
lovell
the
owner
of
the
room
i
want
scaife
said
john
i
mean
that
trieve
wants
scaife
oh
miss
trieve
wants
master
scaife
does
she
well
young
you
tell
trieve
with
my
compliments
that
scaife
ca
come
see
now
hook
it
but
john
still
stared
at
scaife
the
boy
dishevelled
appearance
his
wild
eyes
his
shrill
laughter
revealed
another
scaife
you
better
come
scaife
he
faltered
not
i
said
scaife
he
spoke
in
a
curiously
voice
quite
unlike
his
usual
cool
quiet
tone
wait
a
mo
i
not
trieve
fag
i
nobody
fag
now
am
i
he
appealed
to
the
crowd
it
was
an
unwritten
rule
at
the
manor
that
members
of
the
house
cricket
or
football
elevens
were
exempt
from
fagging
but
the
common
law
of
fagging
at
harrow
holds
that
any
lower
boy
is
bound
to
obey
the
monitors
provided
such
obedience
is
not
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
school
in
practice
however
no
boy
is
fagged
outside
his
own
house
except
for
in
the
summer
term
fag
not
you
tell
miss
trieve
to
mind
her
own
business
john
departed
feeling
that
an
older
and
wiser
boy
might
have
tact
to
cope
with
this
situation
for
him
no
course
of
action
presented
itself
except
delivering
what
amounted
to
a
declaration
of
war
wo
come
is
he
mad
come
they
said
oh
ca
come
has
he
hurt
himself
sprained
anything
john
was
truthful
more
of
a
habit
than
some
people
believe
he
told
the
truth
just
as
some
boys
quibble
and
prevaricate
simply
and
naturally
but
now
he
hesitated
if
he
hinted
a
hint
would
suffice
that
scaife
had
hurt
himself
and
what
more
likely
after
the
furious
bit
of
playing
which
had
secured
his
fez
trieve
probably
would
do
nothing
john
felt
in
his
bones
that
trieve
would
be
glad
of
an
excuse
to
do
nothing
no
he
has
sprained
himself
then
why
do
he
come
i
i
then
he
burst
into
excited
speech
he
looks
as
if
he
a
little
mad
oh
trieve
wo
you
leave
him
alone
please
do
they
must
stop
before
prayers
and
then
lawrence
will
be
here
o
unhappy
john
thou
art
not
a
diplomatist
why
lug
in
lawrence
who
has
inspired
mordant
jealousy
and
envy
in
the
heart
of
his
second
in
command
tell
scaife
to
come
here
at
once
said
trieve
eyeing
a
couple
of
canes
in
the
corner
and
if
he
should
happen
to
ask
what
i
want
him
for
say
that
i
mean
to
whop
him
john
fled
whop
him
the
fifth
howled
rage
and
remonstrance
scaife
fiercely
announced
his
intention
of
not
taking
a
whopping
from
trieve
none
the
less
the
announcement
had
a
sobering
effect
upon
the
elder
boys
the
consequence
of
a
refusal
must
prove
serious
sooner
or
later
scaife
would
be
whopped
probably
by
lawrence
no
matter
that
you
better
go
demon
said
lovell
trieve
ca
hurt
you
i
speak
to
the
idiot
only
he
hates
me
so
poisonously
just
as
i
hate
him
i
go
said
the
caterpillar
john
had
not
noticed
the
caterpillar
before
he
stood
up
spick
and
span
carefully
adjusting
his
coat
pulling
down
his
immaculate
cuffs
good
old
caterpillar
said
somebody
by
jove
he
really
thinks
that
trieve
will
listen
to
him
any
one
who
has
been
nearly
three
years
in
this
house
said
the
caterpillar
has
the
right
to
tell
miss
trieve
that
she
is
er
not
behaving
like
a
lady
and
he
tell
you
you
screwed
you
old
fool
i
am
not
screwed
replied
the
caterpillar
solemnly
whisky
and
potass
does
not
agree
with
everybody
but
i
am
not
screwed
not
at
all
so
speaking
he
sat
down
rather
suddenly
lovell
shrugged
his
shoulders
glanced
at
the
caterpillar
and
scaife
and
left
the
room
within
two
minutes
he
returned
chapfallen
and
frowning
i
knew
it
would
be
useless
look
here
demon
you
must
grin
and
bear
it
no
said
scaife
not
from
miss
trieve
he
laughed
as
before
the
fifth
exchanged
glances
then
scaife
said
thickly
give
me
another
drink
i
want
a
drink
so
does
young
verney
look
at
him
john
was
white
about
the
gills
and
trembling
but
not
for
himself
do
go
scaife
he
entreated
the
fifth
formed
a
group
holding
a
council
of
war
engrossed
in
trying
to
find
a
way
out
of
a
wood
which
of
a
sudden
had
turned
into
a
tangled
thicket
and
so
what
each
would
have
strenuously
prevented
came
to
pass
scaife
pulled
a
bottle
from
under
a
and
put
it
to
his
lips
john
standing
at
the
door
could
not
see
what
was
taking
place
when
the
bottle
was
torn
from
scaife
hands
the
mischief
had
been
done
the
boy
had
swallowed
a
quantity
of
raw
spirit
till
now
the
whisky
had
been
much
diluted
with
mineral
water
i
going
to
him
yelled
scaife
struggling
with
his
friends
and
going
to
take
a
cricket
stump
with
me
go
go
the
caterpillar
surveyed
him
with
disgust
after
a
brief
struggle
scaife
succumbed
helpless
and
senseless
one
is
reminded
sometimes
said
the
caterpillar
solemnly
that
the
poor
demon
is
the
son
of
a
liverpool
merchant
bred
in
or
about
the
docks
nobody
however
paid
any
attention
to
egerton
who
to
do
him
justice
was
the
only
boy
present
absolutely
unmindful
of
his
own
peril
expulsion
loomed
imminent
the
window
was
flung
wide
open
eau
de
cologne
liberally
applied
scaife
lay
like
a
log
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
confusion
trieve
walked
in
scaife
has
had
a
sort
of
fit
explained
an
accomplished
liar
you
know
what
his
temper
is
trieve
and
when
he
heard
that
you
meant
to
him
he
went
stark
staring
mad
this
explanation
was
so
near
the
truth
that
trieve
accepted
it
probably
with
mental
reservations
you
had
better
send
for
puttick
he
replied
coldly
the
caterpillar
was
despatched
for
the
matron
but
before
that
worthy
woman
panted
upstairs
scaife
had
been
carried
to
his
own
room
hastily
undressed
and
put
into
bed
where
he
lay
breathing
stertorously
the
matron
good
easy
soul
accepted
the
boys
story
unhesitatingly
a
fit
of
course
poor
dear
child
rutford
must
be
summoned
with
the
optimism
of
youth
those
present
began
to
hope
that
dust
might
be
thrown
into
the
eyes
of
dirty
dick
and
with
a
little
discreet
delay
the
demon
might
recover
when
he
could
be
relied
upon
to
play
his
part
with
adroitness
and
ability
accordingly
the
matron
was
urged
to
try
her
ministering
hand
first
amid
the
chaff
which
even
in
emergencies
slips
so
easily
out
of
boys
mouths
puttick
you
better
than
any
doctor
scaife
is
all
right
we
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
fits
rather
some
one
was
telling
me
that
one
of
his
aunts
died
in
a
fit
shut
up
you
silly
fool
this
in
a
whisper
emphasized
by
a
kick
do
you
want
to
send
her
out
of
this
with
a
hornets
nest
tied
to
her
back
hair
that
a
lie
puttick
he
humbugging
you
scaife
told
me
that
his
fits
were
nothing
yes
he
had
a
slight
when
he
was
a
kid
you
know
and
the
least
bit
of
excitement
affects
him
perhaps
i
better
fetch
a
drop
of
brandy
said
puttick
staring
anxiously
at
scaife
he
looks
very
bad
yes
please
do
mrs
puttick
she
bustled
away
now
we
bring
him
to
said
the
fifth
form
everything
was
tried
even
to
the
expedient
of
flicking
scaife
body
with
a
wet
towel
but
the
body
lay
motionless
his
face
horribly
red
against
the
white
pillow
his
heavy
breathing
growing
more
laboured
and
louder
and
despite
the
perfume
of
the
eau
de
cologne
which
had
drenched
pillow
and
pyjamas
the
smell
of
whisky
spread
terror
to
the
crowd
if
rutford
came
in
he
would
swoop
on
the
truth
we
souse
the
brandy
all
over
him
said
the
caterpillar
and
then
no
one
can
guess
how
about
burnt
feathers
suggested
lovell
he
had
seen
a
fainting
housemaid
treated
with
this
family
restorative
puttick
appeared
with
the
brandy
which
lovell
administered
externally
still
scaife
remained
unconscious
then
a
pillow
was
ripped
open
and
enough
feathers
burned
to
restore
as
the
caterpillar
put
it
afterwards
a
ruined
cathedral
the
stench
filled
the
passage
and
brought
to
no
a
chattering
crowd
of
lower
boys
and
then
the
conviction
seized
everybody
that
scaife
was
going
to
die
make
way
make
way
please
it
was
rutford
who
followed
by
lawrence
strode
down
the
passage
into
no
and
up
to
the
bed
if
you
please
sir
said
lovell
scaife
has
had
a
fit
it
looks
like
a
fit
said
rutford
gravely
i
have
telephoned
for
the
doctor
you
tried
he
sniffed
the
air
all
the
wrong
remedies
of
course
feathers
phaugh
perfume
brandy
the
boy
must
be
propped
up
and
the
blood
drawn
from
his
head
by
applying
hot
water
to
his
feet
the
fifth
exchanged
glances
why
had
this
not
occurred
to
them
what
a
fool
puttick
was
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
rutford
liked
to
hold
forth
and
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
a
capital
speaker
he
had
just
risen
from
an
excellent
dinner
he
was
not
much
alarmed
and
his
audience
listened
with
flattering
attention
scaife
was
lifted
into
a
chair
ice
was
applied
to
his
head
his
feet
were
thrust
into
a
tosh
filled
with
steaming
water
note
the
effect
said
rutford
already
a
slight
change
might
be
perceived
the
breathing
became
easier
the
face
less
red
rutford
continued
in
his
best
manner
mark
the
medicatrix
nature
assisted
by
hot
water
gently
accomplishes
her
task
very
simple
and
not
one
of
you
had
the
wit
to
think
of
a
remedy
close
at
hand
and
so
easy
to
administer
the
breathing
is
becoming
normal
in
a
few
minutes
i
predict
that
we
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
poor
dear
fellow
open
his
eyes
and
he
will
tell
us
that
he
is
but
little
the
worse
yes
yes
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
producing
cerebral
disturbance
he
smiled
blandly
receiving
the
homage
of
the
fifth
and
now
lovell
what
do
you
know
about
this
did
this
fit
take
place
here
in
my
room
sir
in
your
room
eh
what
was
scaife
a
lower
boy
doing
in
your
room
lawrence
gave
him
his
sir
lawrence
nodded
ah
and
scaife
was
excited
perhaps
unduly
excited
eh
the
fifth
joined
in
a
chorus
of
yes
sir
oh
yes
sir
awfully
excited
sir
never
saw
a
boy
so
excited
sir
that
will
do
now
lovell
go
on
we
had
some
siphons
in
our
room
sir
a
stroke
of
genius
this
for
the
siphons
were
still
on
the
table
and
the
syrups
and
the
of
cakes
and
meringues
rutford
would
be
sure
to
examine
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
and
the
whisky
bottle
was
carefully
hidden
we
were
having
a
spread
sir
and
we
asked
scaife
to
join
us
his
play
made
him
one
of
us
the
other
boys
gazed
admiringly
at
lovell
what
a
cool
knowing
hand
yes
yes
i
see
nothing
objectionable
about
that
well
sir
we
were
rather
noisy
go
on
to
speak
the
exact
truth
sir
i
fear
we
were
noisy
and
trieve
it
seems
heard
us
instead
of
sending
for
me
sir
he
sent
verney
for
scaife
ah
lovell
hesitation
at
this
point
was
really
worthy
of
coquelin
of
course
you
know
sir
that
scaife
getting
his
releases
him
from
we
thought
trieve
had
forgotten
that
sir
and
that
it
would
be
rather
fun
i
not
excusing
myself
sir
we
thought
it
would
be
a
harmless
joke
if
we
persuaded
scaife
not
to
go
um
we
were
very
foolish
sir
and
then
trieve
sent
another
message
saying
that
scaife
was
to
go
to
his
room
at
once
to
be
whopped
to
be
whopped
um
rather
drastic
that
very
drastic
under
the
circumstances
so
we
thought
sir
and
i
went
to
represent
the
facts
to
trieve
well
i
not
much
of
a
peacemaker
i
fear
sir
trieve
refused
to
listen
to
me
he
insisted
upon
whopping
scaife
for
what
he
called
disobedience
and
impudence
upon
my
honour
sir
i
tried
we
all
tried
to
persuade
scaife
to
take
his
whopping
quietly
but
he
seemed
to
go
quite
mad
he
has
a
violent
temper
sir
yes
yes
a
very
violent
temper
he
he
frothed
at
the
mouth
put
in
a
bystander
i
particularly
noticed
that
really
really
yes
said
lovell
nodding
his
head
reflectively
he
frothed
at
the
mouth
and
then
grew
quite
black
in
the
face
interpolated
a
third
boy
who
was
determined
that
lovell
should
not
carry
off
all
the
honours
i
should
say
purple
amended
lovell
and
then
he
gave
a
beastly
gurgle
a
sort
of
snort
and
fell
flat
on
his
face
i
not
sure
that
he
strike
the
edge
of
the
table
as
he
fell
he
did
said
one
of
the
boys
i
saw
that
at
this
moment
scaife
moved
in
his
chair
drawing
all
eyes
to
his
face
john
peering
from
behind
the
circle
of
big
boys
could
see
the
first
signs
of
returning
consciousness
a
flicker
of
the
eyelids
a
convulsive
tremor
of
the
limbs
rutford
bent
down
well
my
dear
scaife
how
are
you
we
been
a
little
anxious
all
of
us
but
i
ventured
to
predict
without
cause
tell
us
my
poor
boy
how
do
you
feel
scaife
opened
his
eyes
then
he
groaned
dismally
rutford
was
standing
to
the
right
of
the
chair
and
the
fifth
were
facing
scaife
he
met
their
anxious
admonishing
glances
unable
to
interpret
them
lovell
senior
repeated
the
question
how
are
you
old
chap
but
in
his
anxiety
to
convey
a
warning
he
came
too
near
obscuring
rutford
massive
figure
scaife
groaned
again
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
how
am
i
he
repeated
thickly
why
why
i
jolly
well
screwed
lovell
that
how
i
am
jolly
well
screwed
hay
ugh
how
screwed
i
am
ugh
the
groans
fell
on
a
terrifying
silence
rutford
glanced
keenly
from
face
to
face
then
he
said
slowly
the
wretched
boy
is
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
scaife
relapsed
into
an
insensibility
which
no
one
at
the
moment
cared
to
pronounce
counterfeit
or
genuine
rutford
glared
at
lovell
who
was
in
your
room
lovell
without
waiting
for
lovell
to
answer
the
other
boys
each
in
turn
said
i
sir
or
me
sir
john
came
last
anybody
else
lovell
a
discreet
master
would
not
have
asked
this
question
but
dirty
dick
was
the
last
man
to
waive
an
advantage
now
the
caterpillar
had
quietly
left
no
as
soon
as
rutford
entered
it
not
from
any
cowardly
motive
but
as
he
put
it
afterwards
because
one
makes
a
point
of
retiring
whenever
a
rank
outsider
appears
one
ought
to
be
particular
about
the
company
one
keeps
it
says
something
for
the
boy
character
that
this
statement
was
accepted
by
the
house
as
unvarnished
truth
lovell
glanced
at
the
other
fifth
form
boys
as
rutford
repeated
the
question
anybody
else
lovell
be
careful
how
you
answer
me
nobody
else
said
lovell
on
your
honour
sir
on
my
honour
sir
and
later
all
manorites
declared
that
lovell
had
lied
like
a
gentleman
rutford
and
he
stared
at
each
other
the
boy
pale
but
the
big
burly
man
flushed
and
ill
at
ease
you
will
all
go
to
my
study
a
word
with
you
lawrence
the
boys
filed
quietly
out
rutford
looked
at
john
and
fluff
large
fat
tears
were
trickling
down
fluff
cheeks
somehow
he
felt
convinced
that
john
was
involved
in
a
frightful
row
run
away
kinloch
said
his
i
wish
to
speak
with
lawrence
and
verney
he
turned
to
lawrence
as
he
spoke
john
glanced
at
scaife
his
eyes
were
open
silently
scaife
placed
a
trembling
finger
upon
his
lips
the
action
the
expression
in
the
eyes
were
unmistakable
john
understood
as
plainly
as
if
scaife
had
spoken
that
silence
where
expulsion
impended
was
not
only
expedient
but
imperative
kinloch
crept
out
of
the
room
rutford
examined
scaife
who
feigned
insensibility
then
he
addressed
lawrence
go
to
lovell
room
lawrence
and
institute
a
thorough
search
if
you
find
wine
or
spirits
let
me
know
at
once
lawrence
left
the
room
now
verney
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
he
assumed
his
rasping
truculent
tone
and
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
lies
sir
john
was
about
to
repudiate
warmly
his
brutal
injunction
when
the
habit
of
thinking
before
he
spoke
closed
his
lips
immediately
his
face
assumed
the
obstinate
expressionless
look
which
made
those
who
searched
no
deeper
than
the
surface
pronounce
him
a
dull
boy
rutford
for
instance
interpreted
this
stolidity
as
unintelligence
and
lack
of
perception
john
meantime
was
struggling
with
a
thought
which
shaped
itself
slowly
into
a
plan
of
action
he
had
just
heard
lovell
lie
to
save
the
caterpillar
john
knew
well
enough
that
he
might
be
called
upon
to
lie
also
to
save
not
himself
but
scaife
if
he
held
his
tongue
and
refused
to
answer
questions
rutford
would
assume
and
with
reason
that
scaife
had
been
made
drunk
by
the
fifth
form
fellows
then
john
said
quietly
i
am
not
a
liar
sir
certainly
i
have
never
detected
you
in
a
lie
said
rutford
all
the
same
continued
john
in
a
hesitating
manner
i
lie
if
i
thought
a
lie
might
save
a
friend
life
rutford
was
so
unprepared
for
this
deliberate
statement
that
he
could
only
reply
oh
you
would
would
you
yes
said
john
then
he
added
any
decent
boy
or
man
would
oh
oh
indeed
this
is
very
interesting
go
on
verney
scaife
said
he
as
if
he
was
jolly
well
screwed
sir
but
he
is
i
quite
sure
he
is
he
may
feel
like
it
but
he
is
john
could
see
scaife
eyes
slightly
but
sparkling
with
a
sort
of
diabolical
sobriety
at
that
moment
one
thing
alone
seemed
certain
scaife
had
regained
full
possession
of
his
faculties
rutford
stared
at
john
frowning
you
dare
to
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
that
scaife
is
not
drunk
very
seriously
john
answered
i
sure
he
not
drunk
sir
rutford
eyed
the
boy
keenly
have
you
ever
seen
anybody
drunk
he
demanded
i
live
in
the
new
forest
said
john
as
gravely
as
before
and
on
he
was
aware
that
he
had
made
an
impression
upon
this
big
truculent
man
do
try
to
be
funny
with
me
verney
on
no
sir
as
if
i
should
dare
well
well
we
are
wasting
time
trieve
sent
you
to
lovell
room
to
fetch
scaife
yes
sir
and
what
was
scaife
doing
when
you
went
into
the
room
be
very
careful
john
considered
he
was
laughing
sir
laughing
was
he
but
he
stopped
laughing
when
i
gave
him
trieve
message
and
then
he
said
what
lovell
told
you
sir
never
mind
what
lovell
told
me
give
me
your
version
of
the
story
scaife
asked
the
other
fellows
if
trieve
had
any
right
to
fag
him
now
that
he
had
got
his
if
he
had
been
drunk
sir
he
would
have
thought
of
that
would
he
um
said
rutford
slightly
shaken
john
described
his
return
to
trieve
room
and
trieve
threat
lovell
and
you
tell
the
same
story
why
yes
sir
john
made
no
deliberate
attempt
to
look
simple
but
his
face
to
the
master
studying
it
seemed
quite
guileless
just
then
dumbleton
ushered
in
the
doctor
to
him
rutford
recited
what
he
knew
and
what
he
suspected
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
scaife
opened
his
eyes
for
the
second
time
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
doctor
used
the
words
of
the
well
sir
how
do
you
feel
and
then
scaife
answered
in
the
same
dazed
fashion
as
before
i
feel
as
if
i
was
jolly
well
screwed
sir
rutford
nodded
portentously
i
feel
continued
scaife
as
i
did
once
long
ago
when
i
was
a
kid
and
got
hold
of
some
curaçoa
at
one
of
my
father
parties
just
so
said
the
doctor
same
buzzing
in
the
head
same
beastly
feeling
same
same
old
same
old
giddiness
he
closed
his
eyes
and
his
head
fell
heavily
upon
his
chest
it
looks
like
concussion
said
the
doctor
doubtfully
you
say
he
fell
he
turned
to
john
i
was
just
outside
the
door
said
john
we
put
him
into
the
rutford
and
in
a
day
or
two
he
be
himself
again
are
you
sure
that
what
i
er
feared
er
the
doctor
frowned
the
boy
has
had
brandy
of
course
puttick
and
lovell
gave
him
plenty
of
that
john
interpolated
i
believe
you
can
exonerate
the
boy
entirely
said
the
doctor
john
saw
that
rutford
seemed
relieved
i
have
ordered
lovell
room
to
be
searched
if
no
wine
or
spirits
are
found
i
shall
be
glad
to
believe
that
i
have
made
a
very
pardonable
mistake
while
scaife
was
being
removed
lawrence
came
in
with
his
report
nothing
alcoholic
had
been
discovered
in
lovell
room
after
prayers
which
were
late
that
night
dirty
dick
made
a
short
speech
i
had
reason
to
suspect
said
he
that
a
gross
breach
of
the
rules
of
the
school
had
been
made
by
certain
boys
in
this
house
it
appears
i
was
mistaken
no
more
will
be
said
on
the
subject
by
me
and
i
think
that
the
less
said
by
you
big
and
small
the
better
good
night
he
strode
away
into
the
private
side
two
days
later
scaife
came
back
to
no
john
wondered
why
he
stared
at
him
so
hard
upon
the
first
occasion
when
they
happened
to
be
alone
then
scaife
said
well
young
verney
i
sha
forget
that
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
have
been
sacked
and
i
sha
forget
either
that
you
not
half
such
a
fool
as
you
look
john
exhibited
surprise
the
way
you
handled
the
beast
continued
scaife
was
masterly
i
heard
every
word
though
my
head
was
bursting
i
shall
tell
lovell
that
you
saved
us
oh
lord
did
i
give
the
show
away
he
never
tried
to
read
the
perplexity
upon
the
other
face
but
went
away
laughing
he
came
back
with
the
caterpillar
half
an
hour
later
and
the
three
boys
sat
down
as
usual
to
prepare
some
livy
john
was
sensible
that
his
companions
treated
him
not
only
as
an
equal
a
new
and
agreeable
experience
but
as
a
friend
in
the
course
of
the
first
ten
minutes
scaife
said
to
the
caterpillar
he
told
dick
to
his
face
that
he
would
lie
to
save
a
pal
and
the
caterpillar
replied
seriously
good
kid
very
good
kid
lovell
says
he
going
to
give
a
tea
in
his
honour
no
he
is
it
my
turn
accordingly
upon
the
next
scaife
gave
a
tea
at
the
creameries
of
all
the
strange
things
that
had
happened
during
the
past
fortnight
this
to
our
simple
john
seemed
the
strangest
he
was
not
conscious
of
having
done
or
said
anything
to
justify
the
esteem
and
consideration
in
which
scaife
the
caterpillar
and
lovell
seemed
to
hold
him
you
forgotten
desmond
he
said
to
scaife
when
the
latter
mentioned
the
names
of
his
guests
cæsar
is
coming
by
the
way
verney
you
not
been
talking
to
cæsar
about
the
row
in
our
house
no
said
john
lawrence
came
round
and
said
that
i
must
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
naturally
you
did
what
you
were
told
to
do
the
tone
disappeared
in
a
burst
of
laughter
as
john
answered
yes
of
course
and
i
suppose
it
never
entered
your
head
that
lawrence
would
not
have
been
so
particular
about
shutting
your
mouth
without
good
reason
perhaps
said
john
after
a
pause
lawrence
was
in
a
funk
lest
lest
go
on
lest
the
thing
should
be
exaggerated
exactly
lots
of
fellows
would
go
about
saying
that
i
was
dead
drunk
eh
they
might
and
that
would
be
coming
dangerously
near
the
truth
oh
scaife
then
you
really
scaife
laughed
again
yes
i
really
was
my
moses
in
the
bulrushes
do
look
so
miserable
i
guessed
all
along
that
you
were
in
the
know
well
i
every
bit
as
grateful
you
stood
up
to
dick
like
a
hero
and
my
tea
is
in
your
honour
oh
scaife
you
you
wo
do
it
again
get
screwed
said
scaife
gravely
i
shall
not
it
is
good
enough
we
chucked
the
stuff
away
if
they
found
it
ah
if
the
old
caterpillar
attended
to
that
he
a
downy
bird
i
can
tell
you
when
dick
came
into
our
room
he
slipped
back
to
room
carried
off
the
whisky
hid
it
washed
the
glasses
and
then
dirtied
them
with
siphon
and
syrup
the
caterpillar
and
you
showed
great
head
we
shall
drink
your
healths
in
tea
and
chocolate
john
wondered
what
scaife
had
said
to
the
fifth
at
any
rate
they
asked
john
no
questions
and
treated
him
with
distinguished
courtesy
and
favour
but
that
evening
when
john
was
fagging
in
lawrence
room
the
great
man
said
abruptly
i
saw
you
walking
with
lovell
senior
this
afternoon
john
explained
lawrence
frowned
oh
you
been
celebrating
have
you
thanksgiving
service
at
the
creameries
now
look
here
verney
i
met
your
uncle
and
he
asked
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
because
of
that
i
made
you
my
fag
you
a
green
hand
when
i
had
the
pick
of
the
house
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
said
john
warmly
we
sink
that
i
five
years
older
than
you
and
i
know
every
blessed
and
he
spoke
with
great
emphasis
thing
that
goes
on
in
this
house
i
know
for
instance
that
dust
was
thrown
and
very
cleverly
thrown
into
rutford
eyes
and
you
helped
to
throw
it
speak
you
did
quite
know
what
you
were
up
to
well
it
lucky
for
lovell
and
that
one
innocent
kid
was
mixed
up
in
that
affair
but
it
been
rather
unlucky
for
you
i
sooner
see
you
kicked
about
a
bit
by
those
fellows
than
petted
i
sorry
sorry
do
you
hear
the
whole
lot
were
not
sacked
and
now
you
can
hook
it
i
said
enough
perhaps
too
much
but
i
believe
i
can
trust
you
after
this
john
showed
his
gratitude
by
painstaking
attention
to
fagging
lawrence
became
aware
of
faithful
service
that
his
toast
was
always
done
to
a
turn
that
his
daily
paper
was
warmed
as
john
had
seen
the
butler
at
home
warm
the
that
his
pens
were
changed
his
renewed
and
so
forth
in
john
eyes
lawrence
occupied
a
position
near
the
apex
of
the
world
pyramid
of
great
men
footnotes
κραιπάλη
is
translated
by
liddell
and
scott
as
the
result
of
a
debauch
chapter
iv
again
we
rush
across
the
slush
a
pack
of
breathless
faces
and
charge
and
fall
and
see
the
ball
fly
whizzing
through
the
bases
the
remainder
of
the
term
slipped
away
without
farther
accident
or
incident
apart
from
the
preparation
of
work
john
saw
little
of
scaife
or
egerton
the
fifth
nodded
to
him
in
a
friendly
fashion
when
he
passed
them
in
the
street
and
greater
kindness
on
their
part
left
him
alone
possibly
lawrence
had
said
a
word
to
lovell
such
leisure
as
john
enjoyed
a
new
boy
at
harrow
has
not
much
he
spent
with
the
devoted
fluff
desmond
and
scaife
walked
together
on
sunday
afternoons
but
the
fact
that
desmond
seemed
to
be
vanishing
out
of
his
horizon
made
no
difference
to
john
affection
for
him
very
humbly
he
worshipped
at
a
distance
on
clear
dry
days
fluff
and
he
would
climb
to
the
top
of
the
wall
of
the
squash
to
see
scaife
and
desmond
play
a
single
they
were
extraordinarily
in
strength
activity
and
skill
john
noticed
however
that
the
demon
lost
his
temper
when
he
lost
a
game
whereas
cæsar
only
laughed
somehow
john
divined
that
the
demon
was
making
the
effort
of
his
life
to
secure
desmond
friendship
and
cæsar
had
ideals
standards
to
which
the
demon
pretended
to
attain
good
simple
john
made
sure
that
cæsar
would
elevate
the
demon
to
his
plane
that
evil
would
be
exorcised
by
good
only
in
his
dreams
did
the
demon
have
the
advantage
just
before
the
end
of
the
term
cæsar
said
to
him
after
all
i
jolly
glad
i
coming
into
your
house
because
the
old
demon
is
such
a
ripper
and
he
and
i
have
been
talking
things
over
as
mad
keen
as
i
am
about
games
and
although
the
manorites
have
not
played
in
a
match
at
cricket
or
footer
for
years
still
there
is
a
chance
for
us
at
torpids
next
term
you
play
verney
improved
a
lot
so
the
demon
says
and
he
be
captain
then
there
are
the
sports
if
only
dirty
dick
could
be
knocked
on
the
head
the
manor
might
jump
to
the
front
again
it
will
said
john
when
the
school
reassembled
after
christmas
desmond
entered
the
manor
and
found
himself
with
scaife
in
a
a
civil
note
from
the
man
of
millions
had
arranged
this
to
john
was
given
a
also
with
the
duffer
as
stable
companion
fluff
remained
in
no
the
duffer
had
got
his
remove
from
the
top
shell
into
john
form
scaife
and
desmond
were
elevated
into
the
upper
remove
it
followed
therefore
that
scaife
and
desmond
prepared
work
in
their
own
room
the
caterpillar
joining
the
duffer
and
john
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
although
desmond
had
become
a
manorite
he
was
practically
speaking
out
of
john
orbit
the
caterpillar
had
now
been
three
years
in
the
school
and
he
governed
himself
accordingly
he
put
on
a
barmaid
collar
and
spent
much
time
on
the
top
step
of
the
boys
entrance
to
the
manor
no
mere
presumed
to
occupy
this
sacred
spot
had
he
dared
to
do
so
the
caterpillar
would
have
made
things
very
sultry
for
him
also
he
informed
the
duffer
and
john
that
by
virtue
of
his
position
he
proposed
to
prepare
no
work
at
all
each
con
was
divided
into
two
equal
parts
the
duffer
mugged
up
one
john
the
other
then
the
caterpillar
would
be
summoned
and
glean
the
harvest
the
duffer
had
a
crib
or
two
but
the
caterpillar
forbade
their
use
you
kids
said
he
ought
not
to
use
besides
dangerous
the
caterpillar
deportment
and
coolness
filled
john
and
the
duffer
with
respect
and
admiration
the
master
in
charge
of
the
lower
remove
happened
to
be
the
caterpillar
took
shameful
advantage
of
this
at
repetitions
for
instance
he
would
read
horace
odes
off
a
page
concealed
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
or
if
practicable
pin
the
page
on
to
the
master
desk
he
had
genius
for
extricating
himself
and
others
out
of
what
boys
call
tight
places
one
anecdote
well
known
to
the
lower
school
and
repeated
as
proof
of
the
caterpillar
masterly
methods
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
sort
of
influence
egerton
wielded
when
he
was
in
the
fourth
his
form
met
in
the
old
schools
in
a
room
not
far
from
that
august
chamber
used
by
the
head
master
and
upper
sixth
one
day
the
master
in
charge
of
the
form
happened
to
be
late
the
small
boys
in
the
passage
celebrated
his
absence
with
dance
and
song
when
the
belated
man
arrived
a
monitor
awaited
him
the
head
master
presented
his
compliments
to
a
and
wished
to
learn
the
names
of
the
boys
who
had
created
such
a
scandalous
disturbance
a
invited
the
roysterers
to
give
up
their
names
under
penalties
of
extra
school
hateful
necessity
silence
succeeded
a
grew
irate
the
monitor
tried
to
conceal
a
smile
any
boy
who
was
making
any
noise
at
all
stand
up
the
caterpillar
rose
slowly
long
and
thin
spick
and
span
if
you
please
sir
said
he
i
was
a
sense
of
humour
was
tickled
my
compliments
to
the
head
master
said
he
and
please
tell
him
that
i
find
on
careful
inquiry
that
egerton
was
whispering
a
shout
of
laughter
from
olympus
proclaimed
that
the
message
had
been
delivered
the
caterpillar
had
saved
the
situation
john
became
a
disciple
of
this
accomplished
young
gentleman
and
tried
to
imitate
him
for
egerton
represented
faithfully
enough
traditions
to
which
john
bowed
the
knee
upon
any
point
of
schoolboy
honour
his
authority
ruled
supreme
he
told
the
truth
among
his
peers
he
loathed
obscenity
he
disliked
and
condemned
bad
language
the
best
men
do
swear
much
he
would
say
it
doosid
bad
form
i
allow
myself
a
or
two
nothing
more
my
who
was
one
of
the
regency
lot
was
known
as
cursing
egerton
but
nowadays
we
leave
that
sort
of
thing
to
bargees
quite
unconsciously
john
assimilated
the
caterpillar
axioms
we
not
sent
here
at
enormous
expense
to
learn
only
latin
and
greek
at
harrow
and
eton
one
is
licked
into
shape
for
the
big
things
diplomacy
politics
the
services
one
is
taught
manners
what
i
not
a
marrying
sort
of
man
but
if
i
do
have
sons
i
shall
send
here
even
if
i
have
to
pinch
a
bit
this
was
the
side
of
egerton
which
appealed
so
strongly
to
john
the
caterpillar
was
an
harrovian
to
the
core
like
the
duffer
and
cæsar
desmond
he
deplored
the
increasing
predominance
of
sons
of
very
rich
men
and
he
anathematized
harrovian
fathers
who
were
persuaded
by
etonian
wives
to
send
their
sons
to
the
plain
instead
of
to
the
hill
that
some
of
the
famous
harrow
families
who
owed
so
much
to
the
school
should
forsake
it
seemed
to
egerton
the
unpardonable
sin
during
this
term
regretfully
must
it
be
recorded
that
john
scamped
his
prep
and
ragged
in
form
whenever
a
suitable
chance
presented
itself
the
duffer
and
he
bribed
a
chaw
to
throw
gravel
against
the
windows
of
the
room
where
the
boys
were
supposed
to
be
mastering
the
problems
of
euclid
and
algebra
the
tique
master
had
been
third
wrangler
but
he
could
tackle
his
division
properly
upon
this
occasion
the
chaw
created
such
a
disturbance
that
on
audacious
demand
leave
was
granted
to
the
duffer
and
john
to
capture
the
offender
the
young
rascals
pursued
the
chaw
as
far
as
the
metropolitan
station
and
presented
that
conscientious
youth
with
another
sixpence
then
it
occurred
to
john
that
it
might
be
expedient
to
capture
some
bogus
prisoner
so
by
means
of
talk
sugared
with
chocolates
they
persuaded
a
little
girl
to
impersonate
the
thrower
of
gravel
the
little
girl
carefully
coached
in
her
part
was
led
to
the
wrangler
but
made
her
burst
into
tears
at
the
critical
moment
somehow
or
other
the
truth
leaked
out
the
duffer
and
john
were
sent
up
to
the
head
master
and
swished
each
collected
a
few
twigs
of
the
birch
carefully
preserved
to
this
day
meantime
the
torpid
were
coming
on
and
the
school
agreed
wonderingly
that
dirty
dick
had
a
chance
of
being
the
fact
that
the
manor
has
lost
caste
brought
about
this
possibility
boys
just
under
fifteen
found
room
at
the
manor
when
other
houses
were
full
all
the
manorites
in
the
shell
and
removes
were
fellows
who
had
come
to
harrow
rather
over
than
under
fourteen
years
of
age
and
when
the
list
of
the
torpid
eleven
was
posted
did
john
heart
boil
with
pride
when
he
read
his
own
name
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
manor
won
the
first
and
the
second
of
the
matches
then
came
the
with
damer
when
the
teams
met
in
the
the
difference
in
the
size
of
the
players
was
remarked
damer
torpids
were
small
boys
not
much
bigger
than
john
or
the
duffer
but
they
had
behind
them
that
stupendous
force
which
is
fashioned
out
of
pride
de
begotten
of
success
and
strongest
of
all
the
conviction
that
every
would
fight
till
he
dropped
for
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
crack
house
at
harrow
not
a
boy
in
damer
team
was
scaife
equal
as
a
player
but
in
strength
lay
the
weakness
of
the
manorites
they
relied
upon
one
player
damer
pinned
faith
to
eleven
as
it
happened
to
be
a
fine
day
the
school
turned
out
in
force
to
witness
the
match
most
of
the
masters
were
present
and
some
ladies
rutford
however
had
business
elsewhere
the
school
commented
upon
his
absence
with
sly
smiles
and
shrugs
of
the
shoulder
some
of
the
manorites
were
indifferent
the
better
sort
raged
the
caterpillar
appeared
upon
the
ground
in
a
faultless
overcoat
carrying
a
large
bag
of
lemons
his
straw
hat
was
cocked
at
a
slight
angle
one
is
really
uncommonly
obliged
to
dirty
dick
for
staying
away
he
told
everybody
speaking
personally
the
mere
sight
of
him
is
very
upsetting
to
me
keen
as
one
feels
about
this
match
one
ca
deny
that
there
is
not
room
in
a
footer
field
for
dirty
dick
and
a
person
none
the
less
the
absence
of
their
had
a
bad
effect
upon
the
torpids
damer
you
may
be
sure
had
come
down
prepared
to
cheer
louder
than
any
boy
in
his
house
damer
it
was
whispered
had
been
known
to
shed
tears
when
his
house
suffered
defeat
damer
in
fine
inspired
ardours
a
passion
of
endeavour
scaife
won
the
toss
and
kicked
off
for
the
first
five
minutes
nothing
of
interest
happened
damer
played
collectively
the
manorites
rather
waited
upon
the
individual
when
scaife
chance
came
so
it
was
predicted
he
would
go
through
the
damer
centre
as
irresistibly
as
a
russian
battleship
cuts
through
a
fleet
of
rutford
being
absent
dumbleton
the
butler
stood
well
to
the
fore
he
never
missed
a
and
no
one
could
guess
looking
at
his
wooden
countenance
how
the
game
was
going
for
he
accepted
either
defeat
or
victory
with
a
dignified
a
smart
bit
of
work
provoked
a
bland
well
played
sir
played
sir
uttered
in
the
same
respectful
tone
in
which
he
requested
lovell
let
us
say
to
go
to
rutford
study
after
prayers
the
fags
believed
that
dumber
who
had
begun
his
career
as
at
the
manor
in
the
glorious
days
of
old
had
given
notice
to
leave
when
he
learned
that
dirty
dick
was
about
to
assume
command
but
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
stay
by
the
promise
of
an
enormous
salary
nothing
disturbed
his
equanimity
on
the
previous
saturday
evening
john
had
heated
the
wrong
end
of
the
poker
in
no
knowing
that
dumber
duty
constrained
him
to
march
round
the
house
after
lights
out
to
rake
out
any
fires
that
might
be
still
burning
snug
under
his
counterpane
the
practical
joker
awaited
chuckling
a
choleric
word
from
the
impassive
and
impeccable
butler
how
did
dumber
divine
that
the
poker
was
unduly
hot
and
black
with
soot
underneath
who
can
answer
that
question
the
fact
remains
that
he
seized
john
best
sunday
trousers
which
were
laid
out
on
a
chair
and
holding
the
poker
with
these
accomplished
his
task
without
remark
or
smile
the
trousers
had
to
be
sent
to
the
tailor
to
be
cleaned
not
far
from
dumber
stood
a
group
of
small
boys
including
the
unhappy
fluff
unhappy
because
he
was
not
playing
despite
arduous
training
entirely
to
please
john
and
systematic
coaching
his
failure
meant
further
separation
from
john
whom
it
will
be
remembered
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
call
by
his
christian
name
had
he
been
included
amongst
the
torpids
of
late
fluff
had
not
seen
much
of
john
and
in
his
dark
hours
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
linger
not
unpleasantly
sometimes
upon
premature
death
and
john
subsequent
remorse
meantime
scaife
and
desmond
were
playing
a
furious
game
which
must
have
proved
successful
had
it
not
been
for
the
admirable
steadiness
of
the
enemy
lawrence
watched
their
efforts
with
compressed
lips
and
frowning
brows
he
knew
who
better
that
his
cracks
were
tearing
themselves
to
tatters
but
his
protests
were
drowned
by
the
shrill
cheers
of
the
fags
rutfords
go
it
old
demon
jolly
well
played
cæsar
sky
him
well
skied
sir
well
given
well
taken
the
last
exclamation
proclaimed
that
yards
had
been
given
to
scaife
right
in
front
of
damer
base
damer
retreated
scaife
with
heaving
chest
balanced
the
big
ball
between
the
tips
of
his
fingers
scaife
had
missed
an
easy
shot
lawrence
could
see
that
the
boy
was
trembling
with
disappointment
and
mortification
barbed
arrows
from
damer
small
boys
pierced
manorite
hearts
jolly
well
boshed
scaife
good
kind
old
demon
thank
you
scaife
and
like
derisive
approbation
rolled
from
lip
to
lip
the
caterpillar
turned
to
lovell
showing
temper
ai
he
yes
said
lovell
clever
chap
said
the
caterpillar
reflectively
but
one
is
reminded
that
a
stream
ca
rise
higher
than
its
source
not
mine
that
the
governor
cæsar
is
facing
the
chaff
with
a
grin
the
game
began
again
but
soon
it
became
evident
that
scaife
had
lost
not
only
his
temper
but
his
head
he
rushed
here
and
there
with
so
little
judgment
that
the
odds
amongst
the
sporting
fellows
went
to
six
to
four
against
the
manor
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
they
were
six
to
four
the
other
way
and
inevitably
scaife
wild
and
furious
efforts
unbalanced
desmond
play
both
boys
were
out
of
their
proper
places
to
the
confusion
of
the
rest
of
the
team
within
half
an
hour
damer
had
scored
two
bases
to
nothing
the
caterpillar
distributed
halves
of
lemons
lawrence
went
up
to
scaife
the
captain
of
the
torpids
was
standing
apart
not
far
from
desmond
who
was
sucking
a
lemon
with
a
puzzled
expression
gallant
and
always
hopeful
cæsar
could
not
understand
his
friend
passion
of
rage
and
resentment
with
the
tact
of
his
race
however
he
held
aloof
smiling
feebly
because
he
had
sworn
to
himself
not
to
frown
had
he
looked
to
his
right
he
would
have
seen
john
also
sucking
a
lemon
but
understudying
his
idol
nonchalant
attitude
and
smile
john
was
sensible
of
an
overpowering
desire
to
fling
himself
upon
the
ground
and
howl
instead
he
sucked
his
lemon
stared
at
desmond
and
smiled
valiantly
scaife
said
lawrence
gravely
you
not
playing
the
game
scaife
scowled
i
only
know
i
half
killed
myself
he
muttered
lawrence
continued
in
the
same
steady
voice
yes
because
you
missed
an
easy
base
which
has
happened
to
me
and
every
other
player
scores
of
times
come
here
desmond
desmond
joined
them
lawrence
face
brightened
when
he
saw
hopeful
eyes
and
a
gallant
smile
you
do
despair
we
knock
into
smithereens
yet
that
the
harrow
spirit
but
temper
your
determination
to
win
with
a
little
common
sense
you
overdone
it
both
of
you
take
my
tip
they
play
up
like
blazes
defend
your
own
base
and
then
when
they
spent
trample
on
thank
you
said
desmond
scaife
nodded
sulkily
none
the
less
he
had
too
great
respect
for
lawrence
ability
and
experience
as
a
captain
to
disregard
his
advice
after
the
damer
play
up
and
the
manor
had
to
defend
its
base
against
sustained
and
fierce
attack
again
and
again
a
third
base
was
almost
kicked
again
and
again
superior
weight
prevailed
in
the
scrimmages
within
ten
minutes
damer
were
gasping
and
weary
and
then
the
ball
was
forced
out
of
the
scrimmage
and
kicked
to
the
top
side
place
in
the
field
comparatively
fresh
seeing
the
glorious
opportunity
grasping
it
hugging
it
cæsar
swooped
on
the
ball
he
had
the
heels
of
any
boy
on
the
opposite
side
down
the
field
he
sped
faster
and
faster
amid
the
roars
of
the
school
roars
which
came
to
his
ears
like
the
deep
booming
of
breakers
upon
a
lee
shore
to
many
of
those
watching
him
the
sight
of
that
graceful
figure
that
shining
ardent
face
revealing
the
promise
which
youth
and
beauty
always
offer
to
a
delighted
world
became
an
ineffaceable
memory
damer
turned
to
the
head
of
his
house
and
desmond
ought
to
be
one
of
he
groaned
and
now
cæsar
had
passed
all
forwards
if
he
keeps
his
wits
a
base
is
certain
the
full
back
alone
lies
between
him
and
triumph
but
this
is
the
moment
the
psychological
moment
when
one
tiny
mistake
will
prove
irrevocable
the
head
of
damer
whispers
as
much
to
damer
who
smiles
sadly
his
father
son
will
not
blunder
now
he
replies
nor
does
he
the
mistake
for
mistake
there
must
be
on
one
side
or
is
made
by
damer
back
as
the
ball
rolls
halfway
between
them
the
back
hesitates
and
falters
one
base
to
two
and
eighteen
minutes
to
play
the
second
base
was
kicked
by
scaife
five
minutes
later
by
this
time
the
school
knew
that
they
were
looking
on
at
a
match
not
a
it
was
the
wealth
of
dives
against
the
mite
that
the
winner
of
this
match
would
defeat
easily
either
of
the
two
remaining
houses
and
not
a
man
or
boy
on
the
ground
could
name
with
any
conviction
the
better
eleven
the
betting
languished
at
evens
moreover
both
sides
were
playing
canny
risking
nothing
nursing
their
energies
for
the
last
furious
five
minutes
damer
began
to
fidget
than
he
dropped
out
of
the
front
rank
of
spectators
he
could
stand
still
to
see
his
boys
win
or
lose
he
paced
up
and
down
behind
the
fags
who
winked
at
each
other
damer
got
the
needle
they
whispered
dumbleton
however
stood
still
a
graven
image
of
high
life
below
stairs
what
do
you
think
dumber
asked
fluff
i
think
my
lord
replied
dumber
solemnly
that
every
minute
improves
our
chance
but
if
it
goes
on
longer
he
added
phlegmatically
i
shall
fall
down
dead
my
weak
my
lord
this
was
an
ancient
joke
delivered
by
dumber
as
if
it
were
and
received
by
the
fags
in
a
like
spirit
bless
you
you
got
no
heart
dumber
it
turned
into
tummy
long
ago
or
in
scathing
accents
it
not
your
heart
that
out
of
whack
dumber
but
your
blithering
old
headpiece
what
a
pity
you
ca
buy
a
new
one
and
so
on
and
so
forth
very
soon
however
this
chaff
ceased
excitement
began
to
shake
the
spectators
they
felt
it
up
and
down
their
spinal
columns
it
formed
itself
into
lumps
in
their
throats
it
gave
one
or
two
cramp
in
the
calves
of
their
legs
it
reddened
many
cheeks
and
whitened
as
many
more
the
caterpillar
pulled
out
his
watch
three
and
a
half
minutes
he
announced
in
a
voice
which
fell
like
the
crack
of
doom
upon
the
silent
crowd
if
they
could
have
cheered
or
chaffed
but
the
absolute
equality
of
the
last
desperate
struggle
prevented
any
demonstration
the
ball
was
worried
through
a
scrimmage
escaped
to
the
right
slid
out
to
the
left
only
to
be
returned
whence
it
came
it
seemed
as
if
both
sides
were
unable
to
kick
it
and
when
kicked
it
seemed
to
refuse
to
move
as
if
weighted
by
the
burden
of
suspense
now
now
your
chance
yelled
the
manorites
to
their
flaming
senses
the
ball
appeared
to
be
lying
a
huge
blurred
sphere
upon
the
muddy
grass
and
the
elevens
were
stupidly
staring
at
it
the
saints
be
praised
some
fellow
can
move
who
is
it
the
players
big
and
little
are
so
daubed
with
mud
from
head
to
foot

say
well
played
well
our
john
has
it
seems
distinguished
himself
he
has
charged
valiantly
into
the
captain
of
damer
at
the
moment
when
that
illustrious
chief
is
about
to
kick
the
ball
to
a
trusted
lieutenant
on
the
left
he
succeeds
in
kicking
the
ball
into
john
face
john
goes
over
backwards
but
the
ball
falls
just
in
front
of
the
duffer
kick
it
duffer
kick
it
you
old
ass
the
duffer
kicks
it
most
accurately
kicks
it
well
out
to
the
top
side
now
can
desmond
repeat
his
amazing
performance
yes
no
he
ca
the
conditions
are
no
longer
the
same
half
a
dozen
fellows
are
between
him
and
the
damer
base
alas
the
manor
is
about
to
receive
a
second
upon
the
fatuity
of
trusting
to
individuals
confident
in
cæsar
ability
to
take
the
ball
at
least
within
kicking
distance
of
the
base
they
have
rushed
forward
leaving
unguarded
their
own
citadel
cæsar
going
too
fast
misjudges
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
back
a
second
later
the
ball
is
well
on
its
way
to
the
manor
base
the
back
awaits
it
coolly
enough
knowing
that
damer
forwards
are
offside
then
he
kicks
the
sodden
slippery
ball
hard
an
exclamation
of
horror
bursts
from
the
manorites
their
back
has
kicked
the
ball
straight
into
the
hands
of
the
damerite
captain
the
steadiest
player
on
the
ground
the
chief
collects
himself
for
a
decisive
effort
and
then
despatches
the
ball
straight
and
true
for
the
target
it
passed
between

posts

seconds

john
was
squelching
through
the
mud
wondering
whether
his
nose
was
broken
or
not
when
lawrence
touched
his
shoulder
never
mind
verney
he
said
cheerily
the
manor
will
be
at
torpids
next
year
and
i
venture
to
prophesy
that
you
be
captain
oh
thanks
lawrence
said
john
but
much
as
he
appreciated
this
tribute
from
the
great
man
and
much
as
it
served
to
mitigate
the
pangs
of
defeat
a
yet
happier
stroke
of
fortune
was
about
to
befall
him
desmond
who
always
walked
up
from
the
football
field
with
scaife
conferred
upon
john
the
honour
of
his
company
where
scaife
said
john
the
demon
is
demoniac
said
desmond
he
lost
his
hair
and
he
blames
me
well
i
did
my
best
and
so
did
he
and
there
no
more
to
be
said
it
a
bore
that
we
shall
be
too
old
to
play
next
year
i
told
the
demon
that
if
we
had
to
be
beaten
i
would
sooner
take
a
licking
from
damer
than
any
other
house
and
he
told
me
that
he
believed
i
wanted
to
win
when
a
fellow
in
that
sort
of
blind
rage
i
call
him
dotty
do
you
yes
said
john
you
played
jolly
well
verney
i
expect
lawrence
told
you
so
he
did
say
something
decent
john
replied
the
caterpillar
joined
them
as
they
were
passing
through
the
stile
we
should
have
won
he
said
deliberately
if
the
demon
had
behaved
like
a
rank
outsider
scaife
is
my
pal
said
desmond
hotly
the
caterpillar
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
held
high
his
aquiline
nose
as
he
murmured
one
does
pretend
to
be
a
christian
but
as
a
gentleman
one
accepts
a
bit
of
bad
luck
without
gnashing
one
teeth
what
that
spartan
boy
with
the
fox
was
a
well
bred
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
scaife
is
the
caterpillar
joined
another
pair
of
boys
before
desmond
could
reply
john
looked
uncomfortable
then
desmond
burst
out
with
irish
vehemence
egerton
is
always
jawing
about
breeding
it
rather
snobbish
i
think
the
worse
of
scaife
because
his
grandfather
carried
a
hod
the
egertons
have
been
living
at
mount
egerton
ever
since
they
left
mount
ararat
but
what
have
they
done
and
he
ought
to
make
allowances
for
the
old
demon
he
was
simply
mad
keen
to
win
this
match
and
he
has
a
temper
you
like
him
verney
do
you
john
hesitated
realizing
that
to
speak
the
truth
would
offend
the
one
fellow
in
the
school
whom
he
wished
to
please
and
conciliate
then
he
blurted
out
no
i
do
you
do
desmond
frank
blue
eyes
irish
eyes
deeply
blue
with
black
lashes
encircling
them
betrayed
amazement
and
curiosity
so
john
thought
rather
than
anger
you
do
he
continued
why
not
the
old
demon
likes
you
he
says
you
got
him
out
of
a
tight
place
why
do
you
like
him
verney
john
mind
had
to
speculate
vaguely
whether
or
not
desmond
knew
the
nature
of
the
tight
place
was
such
a
very
descriptive
adjective
out
of
which
he
had
pulled
scaife
then
he
said
nervously
i
do
like
him
because
because
he
likes
you
likes
me
what
a
rum
you
are
verney
why
should
he
like
me
because
said
john
boldly
meeting
the
emergency
with
the
conviction
that
he
had
burnt
his
ships
and
must
advance
without
fear
because
he
not
half
good
enough
for
you
desmond
burst
out
laughing
the
clear
ringing
laugh
of
his
father
which
had
often
allayed
an
incipient
mutiny
below
the
gangway
and
charmed
aside
the
impending
disaster
of
a
and
it
is
on
own
in
the
house
of
commons
that
good
temper
tells
not
good
enough
for
me
he
repeated
thanks
awfully
evidently
you
have
a
high
opinion
of
yes
said
john
the
quiet
monosyllable
so
soberly
so
seriously
uttered
challenged
desmond
attention
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
john
face
not
an
attractive
object
blood
and
mud
disfigured
it
but
the
grey
eyes
met
the
blue
unwaveringly
desmond
flushed
you
stuck
me
on
a
sort
of
pedestal
his
tone
was
as
serious
as
john
yes
said
john
they
were
opposite
the
music
schools
the
other
manorites
had
run
on
for
the
moment
they
stood
alone
ten
thousand
leagues
from
harrow
alone
in
those
sublimated
spaces
where
soul
meets
soul
unfettered
by
flesh
afterwards
not
then
john
knew
that
this
was
so
he
met
the
real
desmond
for
the
first
time
and
desmond
met
the
real
john
in
a
thoroughfare
other
than
that
which
leads
to
the
manor
other
than
that
which
leads
to
any
house
built
by
human
hands
upon
the
shining
highway
of
heaven
shall
we
try
to
set
down
desmond
feelings
at
this
crisis
till
now
his
life
had
run
gaily
through
fragrant
gardens
so
to
speak
pleasaunces
full
of
flowers
of
herbs
of
stately
trees
a
paradise
indeed
from
which
the
ugly
the
crude
the
harmful
had
been
rigorously
excluded
happy
the
boy
who
has
such
a
home
as
was
allotted
to
harry
desmond
and
from
it
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
had
received
tender
love
absolute
trust
the
traditions
of
a
great
family
whose
name
was
part
of
english
history
an
exquisite
refinement
and
with
these
the
gratification
of
all
reasonable
desires
and
this
magnificent
upbringing
shone
out
of
his
radiant
face
the
inexpressible
charm
of
youth
unspotted
white
scaife
upbringing
of
which
you
shall
know
more
presently
had
been
far
different
and
yet
he
the
cynic
and
the
unclean
recognized
the
god
in
harry
desmond
he
had
not
for
instance
told
desmond
of
the
nature
of
that
tight
place
he
had
kept
a
guard
over
his
tongue
he
had
interposed
his
own
strong
will
between
his
friend
and
such
attention
as
a
boy
of
desmond
attractiveness
might
provoke
from
lovell
senior
and
the
like
it
is
true
that
scaife
was
well
aware
that
without
these
precautions
he
would
have
lost
his
friend
none
the
less
above
and
beyond
this
consciousness
hovered
the
higher
more
subtle
intuition
that
the
good
in
desmond
was
something
not
lightly
to
be
tampered
with
something
the
more
so
because
poor
fellow
he
had
never
encountered
it
before
desmond
stood
still
with
his
eyes
upon
john
discoloured
face
not
the
least
of
cæsar
charms
was
his
lack
of
now
for
the
first
time
he
tried
to
see
himself
as
john
saw
him
on
a
pedestal
and
so
strong
was
john
ideal
that
in
a
sense
desmond
did
catch
a
glimpse
of
himself
as
john
saw
him
and
then
followed
a
rapid
comparison
first
between
the
real
and
the
ideal
and
secondly
between
himself
and
scaife
his
face
broke
into
a
smile
why
verney
he
exclaimed
you
must
turn
me
into
a
sort
of
golden
calf
and
as
for
scaife
not
being
good
enough
for
me
why
he
miles
ahead
of
me
in
everything
he
cleverer
better
at
games
ten
thousand
times
better
looking
and
one
day
he
be
a
big
power
and
i
shall
always
be
a
poor
man
why
i
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
used
to
keep
out
of
scaife
way
although
he
was
always
awfully
civil
to
me
because
he
has
so
much
and
i
so
little
he
not
half
good
enough
for
you
repeated
john
with
the
verney
obstinacy
unwittingly
he
slightly
emphasized
the
good
good
do
you
mean
he
not
thank
the
lord
this
made
john
laugh
and
desmond
joined
in
now
they
were
harrow
boys
again
within
measurable
distance
of
the
yard
although
still
in
the
shadow
of
the
spire
the
demon
described
as
pi
tickled
their
ribs
you
must
learn
to
like
the
demon
desmond
continued
as
they
moved
on
then
as
john
said
nothing
he
added
quickly
he
and
i
have
made
up
our
minds
not
to
try
for
remove
this
term
you
see
next
term
is
the
jolliest
term
of
the
year
cricket
and
and
lord
and
we
shall
know
the
form
swat
thoroughly
and
have
time
to
enjoy
ourselves
you
be
with
us
your
remove
is
a
eh
john
beamed
he
had
made
certain
that
cæsar
would
be
in
the
third
fifth
next
term
and
hopelessly
out
of
reach
oh
yes
i
shall
get
my
remove
so
will
the
caterpillar
hang
the
caterpillar
said
desmond
he
ask
for
a
silken
rope
as
lord
ferrers
did
said
john
with
one
of
his
unexpected
touches
of
humour
again
desmond
bent
his
head
in
the
gesture
john
knew
so
well
and
laughed
i
say
verney
you
a
joker
well
the
old
caterpillar
a
good
sort
but
he
not
fair
to
scaife
here
we
are
they
ran
upstairs
to
tosh
and
change
john
found
the
duffer
just
slipping
out
of
his
ducks
he
looked
at
john
with
a
rueful
grin
are
you
going
to
chuck
me
he
asked
chuck
you
fluff
says
you
chucked
him
he
was
in
here
a
moment
ago
to
ask
if
your
nose
was
squashed
i
believe
the
silly
little
ass
thinks
you
the
greatest
thing
on
earth
i
do
chuck
anybody
said
john
indignantly
and
he
made
a
point
of
asking
fluff
to
walk
with
him
on
sunday
after
the
torpid
matches
the
school
settled
down
to
train
more
or
less
for
the
athletic
sports
john
came
to
grief
several
times
at
kenton
brook
essaying
to
jump
it
at
places
obviously
as
the
duffer
pointed
out
beyond
his
stride
the
duffer
and
he
put
their
names
down
for
the
and
curtailed
their
visits
to
the
creameries
after
this
it
is
humiliating
to
record
that
neither
boy
succeeded
in
winning
anything
cæsar
won
the
house
mile
handicap
scaife
won
the
under
sixteen
high
jump
a
triumph
for
the
manor
and
fluff
the
despised
fluff
actually
secured
an
immense
tankard
which
one
of
the
sixth
offered
as
a
prize
because
he
was
quite
convinced
that
his
own
particular
pal
would
win
it
the
distance
happened
to
be
half
a
mile
fluff
was
allowed
an
enormous
start
and
won
in
a
canter
the
term
came
to
an
end
soon
after
these
achievements
and
john
spent
a
week
of
the
holidays
at
white
ladies
the
duke
of
trent
shropshire
place
here
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
august
and
solemn
personage
a
groom
of
the
chambers
with
whiskers
a
white
tie
a
silky
voice
and
the
appearance
of
an
archdeacon
this
visit
is
recorded
because
it
made
a
profound
impression
upon
a
plastic
mind
john
had
never
sat
in
the
seats
of
the
mighty
verney
boscobel
was
a
delightful
old
house
but
it
might
have
been
put
stables
and
all
into
white
ladies
and
never
found
again
fluff
showed
john
the
famous
reynolds
and
gainsborough
portraits
the
van
dycks
and
lelys
the
romneys
and
richmonds
fair
women
and
brave
men
smiled
or
frowned
at
our
hero
wherever
he
turned
his
wondering
eyes
after
the
first
tour
of
the
great
galleries
he
turned
to
his
companion
i
say
he
whispered
solemnly
some
of
look
as
if
they
did
like
my
calling
you
fluff
i
wish
you
call
me
esmé
all
right
said
john
i
will
and
er
although
you
did
get
into
the
torpids
you
can
call
me
john
oh
john
thanks
awfully
ponies
were
provided
for
the
boys
to
ride
and
they
shot
rabbits
in
the
chase
also
they
appeared
at
dinner
a
tremendous
function
and
were
encouraged
by
some
of
the
younger
guests
to
spar
verbally
of
course
with
the
duke
etonian
sons
fluff
looked
so
much
stronger
and
happier
that
his
parents
delighted
with
their
experiment
were
inclined
to
cry
up
the
hill
much
to
the
exasperation
of
the
dwellers
in
the
plain
when
he
left
white
ladies
john
had
learned
one
valuable
lesson
his
sense
of
that
hackneyed
phrase
the
sense
which
remains
nonsense
with
so
many
boys
old
and
young
had
been
quickened
little
more
than
a
child
in
many
ways
he
realized
as
a
man
does
the
true
significance
of
rank
and
wealth
the
duke
of
trent
had
married
a
dame
white
ladies
was
essentially
a
to
which
came
gladly
enough
the
wit
and
beauty
of
the
kingdom
and
yet
the
duke
not
clever
as
compared
to
his
guests
not
even
as
compared
to
the
splendid
gentlemen
whom
van
dyck
and
lely
had
painted
in
fine
in
everything
save
rank
and
wealth
worked
early
and
late
harder
than
any
labourer
upon
his
vast
domain
and
when
john
said
to
fluff
i
say
esmé
why
does
the
duke
work
so
beastly
hard
fluff
replied
with
emphasis
why
because
he
has
to
you
know
it
no
joke
to
be
born
a
duke
and
i
jolly
glad
that
i
a
younger
son
father
says
that
he
has
no
amusements
but
plenty
of
occupation
mother
says
he
the
unpaid
of
the
trent
property
john
went
back
to
verney
boscobel
and
repeated
what
fluff
had
said
as
his
own
it
was
simply
splendid
mum
like
a
sort
of
castle
in
fairyland
and
all
that
but
i
glad
i
not
a
duke
and
i
expect
that
even
an
earl
has
a
lot
of
beastly
jobs
to
do
which
never
bother
oh
you
found
that
out
have
you
john
well
i
hesitated
when
the
invitation
came
but
i
glad
now
that
you
went
yes
and
it
ripping
to
be
home
again
the
summer
term
began
in
glorious
sunshine
and
john
forgot
that
he
owned
an
umbrella
the
caterpillar
and
he
had
achieved
their
remove
but
the
unhappy
duffer
was
left
behind
alone
with
the
hideous
necessity
of
doing
his
form
work
by
himself
the
boys
occupied
the
same
rooms
but
john
prepared
his
greek
and
latin
with
scaife
cæsar
and
the
caterpillar
whom
he
was
now
privileged
to
call
by
their
they
began
to
call
him
john
hearing
young
kinloch
do
so
and
then
one
day
scaife
looking
up
with
his
derisive
smile
said
i
going
to
call
you
jonathan
good
said
desmond
all
the
same
we
ca
call
either
the
duffer
or
fluff
david
can
we
i
was
not
thinking
of
kinloch
or
duff
said
scaife
staring
hard
at
john
and
john
alone
knew
that
scaife
read
him
like
a
book
in
which
he
was
contemptuously
amused
nothing
more
after
that
as
if
scaife
will
were
law
the
others
called
john
jonathan
very
soon
the
sun
was
obscured
by
clouds
john
happened
to
provoke
the
antipathy
of
a
lout
in
his
form
known
as
lubber
sprott
sprott
began
to
persecute
him
with
a
series
of
petty
insults
and
injuries
he
accused
him
of
sucking
up
to
a
lord
of
putting
on
lift
because
he
was
the
youngest
boy
in
the
upper
remove
of
to
the
masters
and
so
forth
then
finding
these
repeated
gibes
growing
stale
he
resorted
to
meaner
methods
he
upset
ink
on
john
books
or
kicked
them
from
under
his
arm
as
he
was
going
up
to
the
new
schools
he
put
a
dringer
into
the
pocket
of
john
bluer
he
pinched
him
unmercifully
if
he
found
himself
next
to
john
in
form
knowing
that
john
would
not
betray
him
when
occasion
offered
he
kicked
john
in
short
he
was
successful
in
taking
all
the
fun
and
sparkle
out
of
the
merrie
month
of
may
finally
cæsar
got
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
is
sprott
ragging
you
he
asked
said
john
blushing
it
he
added
nervously
he
get
tired
of
it
i
expect
i
saw
him
kick
you
said
desmond
frowning
now
look
here
jonathan
you
kick
him
kick
him
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
where
where
he
kicks
you
eh
and
do
it
in
the
yard
at
nine
bill
when
everybody
is
looking
on
you
can
dodge
into
the
crowd
but
if
i
were
you
i
kick
him
at
the
very
moment
he
gets
into
line
and
then
he
ca
pursue
and
if
he
does
pursue
which
i
bet
you
a
bob
he
do
he
have
to
tackle
you
and
me
i
do
it
said
john
next
day
a
whole
holiday
at
nine
bill
both
cæsar
and
john
were
standing
close
to
the
window
of
custos
den
waiting
for
lubber
sprott
to
appear
while
waiting
an
incident
occurred
which
must
be
duly
chronicled
inasmuch
as
it
has
direct
bearing
upon
this
story
only
the
week
before
rutford
had
come
up
to
the
yard
late
for
bill
he
being
the
master
whose
turn
it
was
to
call
over
such
tardiness
which
happens
seldom
is
reckoned
as
an
unpardonable
sin
by
harrow
boys
briefly
it
means
that
six
hundred
suffer
from
the
unpunctuality
of
one
therefore
when
rutford
appeared
slightly
flushed
of
countenance
and
visibly
annoyed
the
school
emphasized
their
displeasure
by
derisive
cheers
rutford
ever
tactless
where
boys
were
concerned
was
unwise
enough
to
make
a
speech
from
the
steps
condemning
in
his
usual
bombastic
style
a
demonstration
which
he
ought
to
have
known
he
was
quite
powerless
to
punish
or
to
prevent
when
he
had
finished
the
school
cheered
more
derisively
than
before
after
bill
he
left
the
yard
purple
with
rage
and
humiliation
upon
this
particular
morning
one
of
the
younger
masters
basil
warde
was
calling
bill
the
school
knew
little
of
warde
save
that
he
was
an
old
harrovian
in
charge
of
a
small
house
and
that
his
form
reported
him
he
had
instituted
a
queer
system
of
punishments
he
made
queer
remarks
he
looked
queer
in
fine
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
radical
and
therefore
a
person
to
be
watched
with
suspicion
by
boys
who
as
a
body
are
intensely
conservative
he
was
of
a
clear
red
complexion
with
blue
eyes
that
peculiar
blue
which
is
the
colour
of
the
sea
on
a
bright
stormy
day
the
upper
school
knew
that
as
a
member
of
the
alpine
club
warde
had
conquered
half
a
dozen
hitherto
unconquerable
peaks
into
the
yard
and
into
this
book
warde
comes
late
as
he
hurried
to
his
place
the
school
greeted
him
as
they
had
greeted
rutford
only
the
week
before
if
anything
the
demonstration
was
slightly
more
hostile
that
bill
should
be
delayed
twice
within
ten
days
was
and
outrageous
when
the
hoots
and
cheers
subsided
warde
held
up
his
hand
he
smiled
and
his
chin
stuck
out
and
his
nose
stuck
up
at
an
angle
familiar
to
those
who
had
scaled
peaks
in
his
company
in
silence
the
school
awaited
what
he
had
to
say
hoping
that
he
might
slate
them
which
would
afford
an
excuse
for
more
ragging
warde
guessing
perhaps
the
wish
of
the
crowd
smiled
more
genially
than
before
then
in
a
loud
clear
voice
he
said
i
beg
pardon
for
being
late
and
i
thank
you
for
cheering
me
i
been
cheered
in
the
yard
since
the
afternoon
when
i
got
my
flannels
a
deafening
roar
of
applause
broke
from
the
boys
warde
might
be
queer
but
he
was
a
good
sort
a
gentleman
and
henceforward
popular
with
harrovians
he
began
to
call
over
as
lubber
sprott
neared
the
place
where
desmond
and
john
awaited
him
the
lubber
took
up
his
position
near
the
boys
turning
a
broad
back
to
them
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
talking
to
another
boy
as
big
and
stupid
as
himself
the
lubber
it
may
be
added
ought
to
have
worn
charity
tails
but
he
had
not
applied
for
permission
to
do
so
he
was
fat
and
gross
rather
than
tall
and
certainly
too
large
for
his
clothes
now
said
cæsar
john
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
as
cæsar
thoughtfully
nudged
other
members
of
the
upper
remove
john
had
room
for
a
very
short
run
the
lubber
was
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
john
timed
his
kick
which
for
a
small
boy
he
delivered
with
surprising
force
so
accurately
that
the
lubber
fell
on
his
face
the
boys
looking
on
screamed
with
laughter
the
lubber
picking
himself
up
john
dodged
into
the
crowd
who
received
him
joyfully
and
glaring
round
encountered
the
contemptuous
face
of
desmond
let
me
have
a
shot
said
cæsar
the
lubber
advanced
spluttering
with
rage
where
is
he
where
is
he
that
infernal
young
verney
by
this
time
fifty
boys
at
least
were
interested
spectators
of
the
scene
desmond
stood
square
in
the
lubber
path
you
like
to
kick
small
boys
said
cæsar
in
a
very
loud
voice
small
half
your
size
why
do
you
kick
me
the
lubber
could
have
crushed
the
speaker
by
mere
weight
but
he
hesitated
and
the
harder
he
stared
at
desmond
the
less
he
fancied
the
job
of
kicking
him
quality
confronted
quantity
kick
me
said
desmond
if
if
you
dare
you
big
hulking
coward
and
cad
come
on
lubber
get
into
line
shouted
some
boy
sprott
turned
slowly
glancing
over
his
vast
fat
shoulder
to
guard
against
further
assault
then
he
took
his
place
in
the
line
and
passed
slowly
out
of
the
yard
and
out
of
these
pages
he
never
persecuted
john
again
not
yet
however
was
the
sun
to
shine
in
john
firmament
as
the
days
lengthened
as
june
touched
all
hearts
with
her
magic
fingers
insensibly
relaxing
the
tissues
and
warming
the
senses
john
became
more
and
more
miserably
aware
that
in
the
fight
between
scaife
and
himself
for
the
possession
of
desmond
the
odds
were
stupendously
against
him
truly
the
demon
had
the
subtlety
of
the
serpent
for
he
used
the
failings
which
he
was
unable
to
hide
as
cords
wherewith
to
bind
his
friend
more
closely
to
him
when
the
facts
for
instance
of
what
had
taken
place
in
lovell
room
came
to
desmond
ears
he
denied
fiercely
the
possibility
of
scaife
his
pal
making
a
beast
of
himself
the
laughter
which
greeted
his
passionate
protest
sent
him
to
scaife
himself
they
say
panted
cæsar
that
last
winter
you
were
dead
drunk
in
lovell
room
i
told
the
beasts
they
lied
scaife
handsome
face
softened
was
he
touched
by
cæsar
loyalty
who
can
tell
always
he
subordinated
emotion
to
intelligence
head
commanded
heart
perhaps
they
did
he
answered
steadily
and
perhaps
they
did
i
deny
nothing
i
admit
nothing
but
his
fine
eyes
so
dark
and
piercing
flamed
cæsar
if
i
was
dead
drunk
at
your
feet
now
would
you
turn
away
from
me
would
you
chuck
me
desmond
winced
scaife
pursued
his
advantage
if
you
that
sort
of
a
fellow
the
pharisee
desmond
winced
again
the
saint
who
is
too
pure
too
holy
to
associate
with
a
sinner
say
so
and
let
us
part
here
and
now
for
i
a
sinner
you
are
not
a
sinner
hold
hard
let
me
have
my
say
i
always
known
that
this
moment
was
coming
yes
i
am
a
sinner
and
my
governor
is
a
sinner
a
hardened
sinner
his
father
made
our
pile
by
what
you
would
call
robbery
the
whole
world
knows
it
and
condones
it
because
we
are
so
rich
even
my
mother
he
paused
trembling
white
to
the
lips
do
said
desmond
please
do
you
right
i
wo
but
i
handicapped
on
both
sides
it
only
fair
that
you
should
know
what
sort
of
a
fellow
you
chosen
for
a
pal
and
it
not
too
late
to
chuck
me
rutford
will
put
verney
in
here
if
i
ask
him
and
by
god
i
in
the
mood
to
ask
him
shall
i
go
to
him
desmond
or
shall
i
stay
he
had
never
raised
his
voice
but
it
fell
upon
the
sensitive
soul
of
the
boy
facing
him
as
if
it
were
a
to
battle
desmond
sprang
forward
ardent
eager
afire
with
generous
forgive
me
he
cried
oh
forgive
me
because
i
ca
forgive
myself
after
this
breaking
of
barriers
scaife
took
less
pains
to
disguise
a
nature
which
turned
as
instinctively
to
darkness
as
desmond
to
light
a
score
of
times
protest
died
when
scaife
murmured
there
i
go
again
forgetting
the
gulf
between
us
and
always
desmond
swore
stoutly
that
the
gulf
if
a
gulf
did
yawn
between
them
should
be
bridged
by
friendship
and
hope
but
insensibly
cæsar
ideals
became
tainted
by
scaife
materialism
scaife
for
instance
spent
money
lavishly
upon
food
and
clothes
so
far
as
a
public
schoolboy
is
able
he
never
denied
his
splendid
young
body
anything
it
coveted
desmond
too
proud
to
receive
favours
without
returning
them
tried
to
vie
with
this
reckless
spendthrift
and
found
himself
in
debt
in
other
ways
a
keen
eye
and
ear
would
have
marked
deterioration
john
noticed
that
cæsar
laughed
although
he
never
sneered
at
things
he
used
to
hold
sacred
that
he
condemned
as
scaife
did
whatever
that
clever
young
reprobate
was
pleased
to
stigmatize
as
or
intolerant
cricket
however
kept
them
fairly
straight
each
was
certain
to
get
his
cap
if
as
lawrence
told
them
they
stuck
to
the
rigour
of
the
game
this
was
lawrence
last
term
he
had
stayed
on
to
play
at
lord
and
when
he
left
trieve
would
become
the
head
of
the
house
a
prospect
very
pleasing
to
the
turbulent
fifth
about
the
middle
of
june
john
suffered
a
parlous
blow
he
was
never
so
happy
as
when
he
was
sitting
in
scaife
room
cheek
by
jowl
with
desmond
sharing
perhaps
a
dringer
poring
over
the
same
dictionary
this
delightful
intimacy
came
to
a
sudden
end
in
this
wise
the
of
the
upper
remove
happened
to
be
a
precisian
in
english
a
sure
road
to
his
favour
was
the
right
use
of
a
word
the
demon
appreciating
this
bought
a
dictionary
of
synonyms
and
made
a
point
of
discarding
the
commonplace
and
obvious
substituting
a
phrase
likely
to
elicit
praise
and
marks
desmond
and
john
joined
in
this
hunt
of
the
right
word
with
enthusiasm
one
evening
the
four
boys
encountered
the
simple
sentence
pretii
quam
quod
æstimari
ll
cover
that
said
cæsar
or
said
the
demon
the
three
other
boys
stared
at
the
demon
and
then
at
each
other
the
caterpillar
something
of
a
purist
in
his
way
drawled
out
one
pronounces
that
my
father
does
said
scaife
hotly
i
heard
him
say
no
doubt
said
egerton
coldly
how
does
father
pronounce
it
cæsar
desmond
said
hurriedly
oh
but
what
does
it
matter
the
demon
sprang
up
furious
it
matters
this
he
cried
i
d
d
if
i
have
egerton
sitting
in
my
room
sneering
at
my
governor
after
this
he
do
his
work
in
his
own
room
or
i
do
mine
in
the
passage
before
desmond
could
speak
scaife
had
whirled
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
john
looked
stupefied
with
dismay
the
caterpillar
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
said
slowly
scaife
father
pronounces
and
so
does
scaife
desmond
stood
up
flushed
and
distressed
but
emphatic
scaife
is
right
about
one
thing
he
said
he
wo
sit
here
like
a
cad
and
listen
to
egerton
sneering
at
his
father
i
very
sorry
but
after
this
we
better
split
up
verney
and
you
egerton
and
scaife
and
i
certainly
said
the
caterpillar
rising
in
his
turn
poor
john
cast
a
distracted
and
imploring
glance
at
desmond
which
flashed
by
unheeded
then
he
got
up
and
followed
the
caterpillar
out
of
the
room
the
passage
was
empty
the
caterpillar
sniffed
as
if
the
atmosphere
in
scaife
room
had
been
polluted
one
has
nothing
to
regret
he
remarked
scaife
has
good
points
and
er
bad
you
noticed
his
hands
eh
unfinished
and
his
foot
short
but
broad
the
caterpillar
surveyed
his
long
slender
feet
with
infinite
satisfaction
then
he
added
with
an
accent
of
finality
scaife
talks
about
going
into
the
grenadiers
but
they
give
him
a
hot
time
there
a
very
hot
time
one
is
really
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
because
of
course
he
ca
help
being
a
bounder
what
does
puzzle
me
is
why
did
cæsar
want
such
a
fellow
for
his
pal
but
he
did
said
john
eh
what
scaife
wanted
cæsar
john
explained
and
i
noticed
caterpillar
that
whatever
scaife
wants
he
gets
he
wants
breeding
jonathan
but
he
never
get
that
never
after
this
john
saw
but
little
of
desmond
and
scaife
hardly
spoke
to
him
accordingly
much
of
our
hero
time
was
spent
in
the
company
of
the
duffer
and
fluff
the
three
passed
many
delightful
hours
together
at
ducker
armed
with
buns
and
chocolate
they
would
rush
down
the
hill
bathe
lie
about
on
the
grass
eat
the
buns
and
chaff
the
kids
who
were
learning
to
swim
long
long
in
the
misty
hereafter
shall
echo
in
ears
far
away
the
lilt
of
that
innocent
laughter
the
splash
of
the
spray
during
the
school
matches
they
spent
the
afternoons
on
the
sixth
form
ground
carefully
criticizing
every
stroke
the
theory
of
the
game
lay
pat
to
the
tongue
but
in
practice
john
was
a
shocking
bungler
at
his
small
preparatory
school
in
the
new
forest
he
had
not
been
taught
the
elementary
principles
of
either
racquets
or
cricket
but
he
had
a
good
eye
played
a
capital
game
of
golf
rode
and
shot
well
for
a
small
boy
fluff
although
still
delicate
gave
promise
of
being
a
cricketer
as
good
possibly
as
his
brothers
when
he
became
stronger
upon
speech
day
john
mother
and
uncle
came
down
to
harrow
and
you
may
be
sure
that
john
escorted
them
in
triumph
to
the
manor
verney
has
since
confessed
that
john
expression
as
she
greeted
him
surprised
and
distressed
her
he
looked
quite
unhappy
and
the
dear
woman
thinking
that
he
must
be
in
debt
seriously
considered
the
propriety
of
tipping
him
handsomely
a
moment
later
as
she
slipped
out
of
an
old
and
shabby
revealing
the
splendours
of
a
dress
fresh
from
paris
she
divined
from
john
now
radiant
face
what
had
troubled
him
john
she
said
you
did
really
think
that
i
was
going
to
shame
you
by
wearing
this
dreadful
cloak
did
you
i
was
quite
sure
john
answered
then
he
burst
out
mum
you
look
simply
lovely
all
the
fellows
will
take
you
for
my
sister
and
after
the
great
function
in
came
the
cheering
how
john
heart
throbbed
when
the
head
of
the
school
standing
just
outside
the
door
proclaimed
the
illustrious
name
three
cheers
for
john
verney
and
how
the
boys
in
the
road
below
cheered
as
the
little
man
descended
the
steps
hat
in
hand
bowing
and
blushing
everybody
knew
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
further
explorations
in
manchuria
he
would
be
absent
so
the
papers
said
three
years
at
least
the
school
cheered
the
louder
because
each
boy
knew
that
they
might
never
see
that
gallant
face
again
later
in
the
afternoon
a
selection
of
harrow
songs
was
given
in
the
five
hundred
faces
as
usual
was
sung
by
a
new
boy
who
is
answered
in
chorus
by
the
whole
school
how
john
recalled
his
own
feelings
less
than
a
year
ago
as
he
stood
shivering
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
funking
the
first
plunge
and
his
uncle
now
sitting
beside
him
had
said
that
he
would
soon
enjoy
himself
amazingly
and
so
he
had
the
new
boy
began
the
second
verse
his
voice
not
a
strong
one
quavered
shrilly
a
quarter
to
seven
there
goes
the
bell
the
sleet
is
driving
against
the
pane
but
woe
to
the
sluggard
who
turns
again
and
sleeps
not
wisely
but
all
too
well
in
reply
to
the
weak
timid
notes
came
the
glad
roar
of
the
school
yet
the
time
may
come
as
the
years
go
by
when
your
heart
will
thrill
at
the
thought
of
the
hill
and
the
pitiless
bell
with
its
piercing
cry
ah
that
pitiless
bell
and
yet
because
of
it
one
wallowed
in
sunday
and
frowsts
john
you
see
had
the
makings
of
a
philosopher
and
now
the
eleven
were
grunting
willow
the
king
and
when
the
last
echo
of
the
chorus
died
away
in
the
great
room
uncle
john
whispered
to
his
nephew
that
he
had
heard
harrow
songs
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
and
that
convincing
proof
of
merit
shone
out
of
the
fact
that
their
charm
waxed
rather
than
waned
with
the
years
they
improved
like
wine
with
age
cæsar
father
came
down
with
the
duke
of
trent
the
duke
tipped
john
magnificently
and
asked
him
to
spend
his
exeat
at
trent
house
and
to
witness
the
eton
and
harrow
match
at
lord
from
the
trent
coach
john
accepted
gratefully
enough
but
his
heart
was
sore
because
just
before
the
row
over
that
infernal
word
inestimable
cæsar
had
asked
john
if
he
would
like
to
occupy
an
attic
in
eaton
square
after
the
row
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
attic
but
john
would
have
preferred
bare
boards
in
eaton
square
to
a
tapestried
chamber
in
park
lane
now
during
the
whole
of
this
summer
term
there
was
much
animated
discussion
in
regard
to
the
rival
claims
of
lines
or
spots
upon
the
white
waistcoat
worn
by
all
harrovians
at
lord
upon
this
important
subject
john
had
betrayed
scandalous
indifference
accordingly
just
before
the
match
the
caterpillar
took
him
aside
and
spoke
a
solemn
word
look
here
he
said
one
does
as
a
rule
make
personal
remarks
but
it
rather
too
obvious
that
you
buy
your
clothes
in
lyndhurst
i
was
sorry
to
see
that
the
duke
of
trent
was
the
man
at
speecher
but
a
duke
can
look
like
a
tinker
and
nobody
cares
i
be
awfully
obliged
if
you
tell
me
what
wrong
said
john
humbly
everything
wrong
said
the
caterpillar
decisively
he
looked
critically
at
john
boots
your
boots
for
instance
most
excellent
boots
for
wading
through
the
swamps
in
the
new
forest
but
quite
impossible
in
town
and
the
you
wear
on
sunday
southampton
you
say
ah
i
thought
it
was
a
verney
heirloom
now
it
surprise
me
to
hear
that
your
mother
who
dresses
herself
quite
charmingly
bought
your
kit
she
did
john
confessed
just
so
one
need
say
no
more
now
you
come
along
with
me
they
marched
down
the
high
street
to
the
most
fashionable
of
the
school
tailors
where
john
was
measured
for
an
eton
jacket
of
the
best
white
waistcoat
with
blue
spots
light
bags
while
the
caterpillar
selected
a
new
topper
an
umbrella
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
tie
be
careful
about
the
bags
said
the
caterpillar
they
are
cutting
in
town
a
trifle
tighter
about
the
lower

but
loose
above
you
understand
perfectly
egerton
replied
the
obsequious
snip
what
we
call
the
style
sir
i
do
think
they
call
it
that
in
savile
row
said
the
caterpillar
but
be
careful
the
tailor
was
assured
that
he
would
receive
an
order
properly
signed
by
rutford
and
then
john
was
led
to
the
bootmaker
and
there
measured
for
his
first
pair
of
the
caterpillar
was
so
exhausted
by
these
labours
that
a
protracted
visit
to
the
creameries
became
imperative
you
always
looked
like
a
gentleman
said
the
caterpillar
after
his
dringer
and
it
a
comfort
to
me
to
think
that
now
you
be
dressed
like
one
so
john
went
up
to
town
looking
very
smart
indeed
and
fluff
who
had
ordered
a
similar
kit
whispered
to
john
at
luncheon
that
his
brothers
the
etonians
had
expressed
surprise
at
the
change
for
the
better
in
their
general
appearance
this
luncheon
was
eaten
on
the
top
of
the
duke
coach
and
it
happened
that
the
next
coach
but
one
belonged
to
scaife
father
john
could
just
see
scaife
handsome
head
and
cæsar
sitting
beside
him
the
boys
nodded
to
each
other
and
the
etonians
asked
questions
at
the
name
of
scaife
however
the
young
kinlochs
curled
contemptuous
lips
unspeakable
bounder
old
scaife
is
he
they
asked
and
the
duchess
replied
my
dears
his
cheques
are
honoured
to
any
amount
even
if
is
her
laughter
tinkled
delightfully
but
john
reflected
that
desmond
was
eating
the
scaife
food
and
drinking
the
scaife
wine
all
bought
with
gold
later
in
the
afternoon
it
became
evident
that
the
scaife
champagne
was
flowing
freely
to
john
dismay
the
harrovians
including
cæsar
on
the
top
of
the
scaife
coach
became
noisy
the
caterpillar
and
his
father
colonel
egerton
sauntered
up
and
were
invited
by
the
duke
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
john
was
amused
to
note
that
the
colonel
was
even
a
greater
buck
than
his
son
he
quite
cut
out
the
poor
old
caterpillar
challenging
and
monopolizing
the
attention
of
all
who
beheld
him
those
boys
are
makin
the
devil
of
a
row
said
the
colonel
fixing
his
eyeglass
ah
the
scaifes
a
man
i
know
dined
with
them
last
week
he
reported
everything
except
the
food
their
is
marcobruno
you
know
presently
to
john
relief
desmond
left
the
scaifes
and
joined
the
trent
party
upon
whom
his
gay
radiant
face
and
charming
manners
made
a
most
favourable
impression
he
laughed
at
the
duchess
stories
and
made
love
to
her
quite
unaffectedly
the
etonians
looked
rather
glum
because
their
wickets
were
falling
faster
than
had
been
expected
desmond
told
the
duke
in
answer
to
a
question
that
his
father
was
in
his
seat
in
the
pavilion
with
his
eyes
glued
to
the
pitch
he
awfully
keen
said
cæsar
you
boys
are
not
so
keen
as
we
were
said
the
duke
nodding
reflectively
oh
but
we
are
sir
indeed
we
are
said
cæsar
are
we
caterpillar
the
caterpillar
replied
thoughtfully
one
bottles
up
that
sort
of
thing
i
suppose
ah
said
the
duke
kindly
if
it
the
right
sort
of
thing
it
none
the
worse
for
being
bottled
up
the
boys
went
to
the
play
that
night
and
enjoyed
themselves
hugely
next
day
however
the
match
ended
in
a
draw
john
was
standing
on
the
top
of
the
coach
very
disconsolate
when
he
saw
desmond
beckoning
to
him
from
below
the
expression
on
cæsar
face
puzzled
him
how
can
you
pal
up
with
those
etonians
whispered
cæsar
after
john
had
descended
every
eton
face
i
see
now
i
want
to
hit
then
he
added
with
a
smile
and
a
chuckle
i
say
there
going
to
be
a
ruction
in
front
of
the
pavvy
come
on
a
minute
later
john
was
in
the
thick
of
a
very
pretty
scrimmage
between
the
hill
and
the
plain
hats
were
bashed
in
cornflowers
torn
from
buttonholes
tassels
were
captured
umbrellas
broken
finally
the
police
interfered
short
but
very
very
sweet
said
cæsar
panting
john
and
he
were
lamentable
objects
for
fond
parents
to
behold
but
the
sense
of
depression
had
vanished
and
then
cæsar
said
suddenly
by
jove
i
got
a
bit
of
news
it
quite
takes
the
sting
out
of
this
draw
what
happened
my
governor
has
been
talking
with
warde
rutford
is
leaving
harrow
john
gasped
that
is
ripping
is
it
but
who
do
you
think
is
coming
to
us
why
warde
himself
he
was
at
the
manor
when
it
was
house
and
the
governor
says
that
warde
will
make
it
house
again
he
got
his
work
cut
out
for
him
eh
you
bet
your
life
said
john

shall
bear
them
along
before
the

of

term
both
desmond
and
scaife
received
their
caps
and
a
word
of
advice
from
lawrence
there
are
going
to
be
changes
here
said
he
and
i
wish
i
could
see
and
help
to
bring
about
now
i
not
given
to
buttering
fellows
up
but
i
see
plainly
that
the
rebuilding
of
this
house
depends
a
lot
upon
you
two
it
not
likely
that
you
able
to
measure
your
influence
if
you
could
there
would
be
much
to
measure
but
take
it
from
me
not
a
word
not
an
action
of
yours
is
without
weight
with
the
lower
boys
everything
helps
or
hinders
next
term
there
will
be
war
to
the
knife
between
warde
and
some
fellows
i
need
name
and
warde
will
win
remember
i
said
so
i
hope
you
he
looked
hard
at
desmond
will
fight
on
the
right
side
the
boys
returned
to
their
room
jubilant
because
the
was
theirs
but
uneasy
because
of
the
words
given
with
it
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
scaife
said
sullenly
does
lawrence
expect
us
to
stand
in
with
warde
against
lovell
and
his
pals
if
he
does
he
jolly
well
mistaken
as
far
as
i
concerned
desmond
flushed
he
had
spent
nearly
five
terms
at
harrow
but
only
two
at
the
manor
of
what
had
been
done
or
left
undone
by
certain
fellows
in
the
fifth
he
was
still
in
twilight
ignorance
he
discerned
shadows
nothing
more
and
boylike
he
ran
from
shadows
into
the
sunlight
desmond
knew
that
there
were
beasts
at
the
manor
had
you
forced
from
him
an
expression
approaching
let
us
say
definiteness
he
would
have
admitted
that
beasts
lurked
in
every
house
in
every
school
in
the
kingdom
you
must
keep
out
of
their
way
and
ways
that
was
all
and
he
knew
also
that
too
many
beasts
wreck
a
house
as
they
wreck
a
regiment
or
a
nation
but
once
or
twice
within
the
past
few
months
he
had
suspected
that
his
views
on
good
and
evil
were
not
shared
by
scaife
scaife
confessed
to
desmond
that
the
old
adam
was
strong
in
him
he
liked
craved
for
the
excitement
of
breaking
the
law
hitherto
this
breaking
of
the
law
had
been
confined
to
such
offences
as
smoking
or
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
at
a
pub
or
using
cribs
or
generally
speaking
setting
at
naught
authority
that
scaife
had
escaped
severe
punishment
was
due
to
his
keen
wits
now
when
scaife
gave
desmond
the
unexpurgated
history
of
the
row
which
so
nearly
resulted
in
the
expulsion
of
six
boys
desmond
had
asked
a
question
do
you
whisky
i
loathe
it
scaife
laughed
before
he
answered
doubtless
one
reason
why
he
exacted
interest
and
admiration
from
desmond
lay
in
a
rare
rare
at
fifteen
ability
to
analyse
his
own
and
others
actions
i
loathe
it
too
he
admitted
really
you
know
we
drank
precious
little
because
it
such
beastly
stuff
but
i
liked
we
all
liked
to
believe
that
we
were
doing
the
correct
thing
eh
and
it
warmed
us
up
just
a
taste
made
the
caterpillar
awfully
funny
i
see
do
you
see
i
doubt
it
cæsar
perhaps
i
shall
horrify
you
when
i
tell
you
that
vice
interests
me
i
used
to
buy
the
when
i
was
a
kid
and
simply
wallow
in
it
i
told
a
woman
that
last
easter
and
she
laughed
she
was
as
clever
as
they
make
and
said
that
i
suffered
from
what
the
french
call
nostalgie
de
la
that
means
you
know
the
homesickness
for
the
gutter
rather
personal
but
sharp
was
it
i
think
she
was
a
beast
not
she
she
a
sort
of
cousin
she
came
from
the
same
old
place
herself
that
why
she
understood
you
do
want
to
know
what
goes
on
in
the
slums
but
i
do
why
because
my
was
born
in
he
pulled
himself
out
by
brains
and
muscles
but
he
went
back
sometimes
oh
yes
he
did
and
the
governor
i
up
to
some
of
little
games
i
could
tell
you
oh
shut
up
said
cæsar
the
colour
flooding
his
cheeks
upon
the
last
saturday
of
the
term
the
school
concert
took
place
few
of
the
boys
in
the
manor
and
none
out
of
it
knew
that
john
verney
had
been
chosen
to
sing
the
treble
solo
always
an
attractive
number
of
the
programme
john
indeed
was
painfully
shy
in
regard
to
his
singing
so
shy
that
he
never
told
desmond
that
he
had
a
voice
and
the
enchanted
by
its
quality
impressed
upon
his
pupil
the
expediency
of
silence
he
wished
to
surprise
the
school
the
concerts
at
harrow
take
place
in
the
great
their
characteristic
note
is
the
singing
of
harrow
songs
to
any
boy
with
an
ear
for
music
and
a
heart
susceptible
of
emotion
these
songs
must
appeal
profoundly
because
both
words
and
music
seem
to
enshrine
all
that
is
noble
and
uplifting
in
life
and
sung
by
the
whole
school
as
are
most
of
the
choruses
their
message
becomes
curiously
emphatic
the
spirit
of
the
hill
is
acclaimed
gladly
triumphantly
unmistakably
by
harrovians
repeating
the
creed
of
their
fathers
knowing
that
creed
will
be
so
repeated
by
their
sons
and
sons
sons
was
it
happy
chance
or
a
happier
sagacity
which
decreed
that
certain
verses
should
be
sung
by
the
school
twelve
who
have
struggled
through
form
after
form
and
know
and
have
not
yet
had
time
to
forget
the
difficulties
and
temptations
which
beset
all
boys
they
to
whom
their
fellows
unanimously
accord
respect
at
least
and
often
as
in
the
case
of
a
captain
of
the
cricket
eleven
enthusiastic
admiration
and
fealty
these
the
gods
in
a
word
deliver
their
injunction
transmit
in
turn
what
has
been
transmitted
to
them
and
invite
their
successors
to
receive
it
to
many
how
poignant
must
be
the
reflection
that
the
trust
they
are
about
to
resign
might
have
been
better
administered
but
to
many
there
must
come
upon
the
wings
of
those
mighty
rushing
choruses
the
assurance
that
the
power
which
has
upheld
them
in
the
past
will
continue
to
uphold
them
in
the
future
in
many
would
one
could
say
in
all
is
quickened
for
the
first
time
perhaps
a
sense
of
what
they
owe
to
the
hill
the
overwhelming
debt
which
never
can
be
discharged
desmond
sat
beside
scaife
scaife
boasted
that
he
could
not
tell
god
save
the
queen
from
the
dead
march
in
saul
he
confessed
that
the
concert
bored
him
desmond
on
the
other
hand
was
always
touched
by
music
or
indeed
by
anything
appealing
to
an
imagination
which
gilded
all
things
and
persons
he
was
scaife
friend
not
only
as
john
discovered
because
scaife
had
a
will
strong
enough
to
desire
and
secure
that
friendship
but
because
a
subtler
reason
he
had
never
yet
seen
scaife
as
he
was
but
always
as
he
might
have
been
desmond
told
scaife
that
he
could
not
understand
why
john
had
bottled
up
the
fact
that
he
was
chosen
to
sing
upon
such
an
occasion
scaife
smiled
contemptuously
you
never
bottle
up
anything
cæsar
said
he
why
should
i
and
why
should
he
i
expect
he
make
an
awful
ass
of
himself
oh
no
he
wo
desmond
replied
he
a
clever
fellow
is
jonathan
as
he
gave
john
his
nickname
desmond
charming
voice
softened
a
boy
of
less
quick
perceptions
than
scaife
would
have
divined
that
the
speaker
liked
john
liked
him
perhaps
better
than
he
knew
scaife
frowned
there
are
several
old
harrovians
he
said
indicating
the
seats
reserved
for
them
it
queer
to
me
that
they
come
down
for
this
caterwauling
desmond
glanced
at
him
sharply
with
a
wrinkle
between
his
eyebrows
for
the
moment
he
looked
as
if
he
were
as
if
he
were
trying
to
define
an
image
somewhat
blurred
conscious
that
the
image
itself
was
clear
enough
that
the
fault
lay
in
the
obscurity
of
his
own
vision
they
come
down
because
they
keen
he
replied
my
governor
leave
his
office
or
he
be
here
i
like
to
see
do
you
demon
i
could
worry
along
without
the
demon
replied
you
see
he
added
with
the
blend
of
irony
and
pathos
which
always
captivated
his
friend
you
see
my
dear
old
chap
i
the
first
of
my
family
at
harrow
and
the
sight
of
all
your
brothers
and
uncles
and
fathers
makes
me
feel
like
mark
twain
good
man
rather
at
once
desmond
responded
clutching
scaife
arm
you
going
to
be
captain
of
the
cricket
and
footer
elevens
and
school
and
a
monitor
and
after
you
leave
you
come
down
here
and
you
see
that
harrow
has
forgotten
you
and
then
you
know
why
these
fellows
cut
engagements
my
governor
says
that
an
hour
at
a
school
concert
is
the
finest
tonic
in
the
world
for
an
old
harrovian
oh
shut
up
said
scaife
you
make
me
feel
more
of
an
outsider
than
good
old
snowball
he
glanced
at
a
youth
sitting
close
to
them
snowball
was
as
black
as
a
coal
the
son
of
the
sultan
of
the
sahara
yes
cæsar
you
ca
get
away
from
it
i
an
you
a
silly
old
ass
i
say
who
the
guest
of
honour
next
to
the
head
master
was
sitting
a
thin
man
upon
whose
face
were
fixed
hundreds
of
eyes
the
school
had
not
been
told
that
a
famous
field
marshal
the
hero
of
a
hundred
fights
was
coming
to
the
concert
and
indeed
he
had
accepted
an
invitation
given
at
the
last
moment
accepted
it
moreover
on
the
understanding
that
his
visit
was
to
be
informal
none
the
less
his
face
was
familiar
to
all
readers
of
illustrated
papers
and
suddenly
conviction
seized
the
boys
that
a
conqueror
was
among
them
an
old
etonian
making
possibly
his
first
visit
to
the
hill
scaife
whispered
his
name
to
desmond
why
of
course
desmond
replied
eagerly
how
splendid
he
leaned
forward
devouring
the
hero
with
his
eyes
trying
to
pierce
the
bronzed
skin
to
read
the
record
from
his
seat
upon
the
stage
john
also
stared
at
the
illustrious
guest
john
was
frightfully
nervous
but
looking
at
the
veteran
he
forgot
the
fear
of
the
recruit
both
desmond
and
he
were
wondering
what
it
felt
like
to
have
done
so
much
and
they
compared
notes
afterwards
each
boy
deplored
the
fact
that
the
great
man
was
not
an
old
harrovian
there
he
sat
cool
calm
slightly
impassive
john
thought
he
must
be
rather
tired
as
a
man
ought
to
be
tired
after
a
life
of
strenuous
endeavour
and
achievement
he
had
done
so
john
reflected
an
awful
lot
even
now
he
remained
the
active
untiring
servant
of
queen
and
country
and
he
had
taken
time
to
come
down
to
harrow
to
hear
the
boys
sing
and
dash
it
all
he
john
was
going
to
sing
to
him
at
that
moment
desmond
was
whispering
to
scaife
i
say
demon
i
jolly
glad
that
i
not
got
to
sing
before
i
bet
jonathan
is
in
a
funk
a
big
bit
of
luck
replied
scaife
reflectively
then
seeing
the
surprise
on
desmond
face
he
added
if
jonathan
can
sing
and
i
suppose
he
can
or
he
would
be
chosen
this
is
a
chance
of
what
cæsar
sometimes
i
think
you
no
brains
why
a
chance
of
attracting
the
notice
of
a
tremendous
swell
a
man
they
say
who
never
forgets
never
jonathan
may
want
a
commission
in
the
guards
as
i
do
and
if
he
pleases
the
great
man
he
may
get
it
jonathan
not
thinking
of
that
said
desmond
the
singers
stood
up
they
faced
the
field
marshal
and
he
faced
them
he
looked
hardest
at
lawrence
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
head
master
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
india
and
the
name
of
lawrence
indelibly
cut
upon
the
memories
of
all
who
fought
in
the
mutiny
and
lawrence
you
may
be
sure
met
his
glance
steadily
being
fortified
by
it
the
good
fellow
felt
terribly
distressed
because
he
was
leaving
the
hill
and
being
a
humble
gentleman
the
old
songs
served
to
remind
him
not
of
what
he
had
done
but
of
what
he
had
left
undone
the
words
unspoken
the
actions
never
now
to
be
performed
the
chief
caught
his
eye
smiled
and
nodded
as
if
to
say
i
claim
your
father
son
as
a
friend
when
the
song
came
to
an
end
john
was
seized
with
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
bolt
his
turn
had
come
he
must
stand
up
to
sing
before
nearly
six
hundred
boys
who
would
stare
down
with
gravely
critical
and
courteously
amused
eyes
and
already
his
legs
trembled
as
if
he
were
seized
of
a
palsy
john
knew
that
he
could
sing
his
mother
who
sang
gloriously
had
trained
him
from
her
he
had
inherited
his
vocal
chords
and
from
her
he
drew
the
knowledge
how
to
use
them
when
he
stood
up
pale
and
trembling
the
silence
fell
upon
his
sensibilities
as
if
it
were
a
dense
yellow
fog
this
silence
as
john
knew
was
an
unwritten
law
the
small
boy
selected
to
sing
to
the
school
as
the
representative
of
the
school
must
have
every
chance
let
his
voice
be
heard
the
master
playing
the
accompaniment
paused
and
glanced
at
his
pupil
john
however
was
not
looking
at
him
he
was
looking
within
at
a
john
he
despised
a
poltroon
a
deserter
about
to
run
from
his
first
engagement
he
knew
that
the
introduction
to
the
song
was
being
played
a
second
time
and
he
saw
the
head
master
whispering
to
his
guest
paralysed
with
terror
john
intuition
told
him
that
the
head
master
was
murmuring
that
the
nephew
of
john
verney
of
course
you
know
him
and
the
field
marshal
nodded
and
then
he
looked
at
john
as
john
had
seen
him
look
at
lawrence
with
the
same
flare
of
recognition
in
the
eyes
out
of
the
confused
welter
of
faces
shone
that
pair
of
eyes
twin
beacons
flashing
their
message
of
encouragement
and
salvation
to
a
in
peril
at
least
so
john
interpreted
that
piercing
glance
it
seemed
to
say
far
plainer
than
words
i
have
stood
alone
as
you
stand
i
have
felt
my
knees
as
wax
i
have
wished
to
run
away
but
nor
must
you
open
your
mouth
and
sing
so
john
opened
his
mouth
and
sang
the
first
verse
of
the
lyric
went
haltingly
scaife
growled
to
desmond
he
going
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
and
desmond
meeting
scaife
eyes
half
thought
that
the
speaker
wished
that
john
would
fail
that
he
grudged
him
a
triumph
none
the
less
the
first
verse
sung
feebly
with
wrong
phrasing
and
imperfect
articulation
revealed
the
quality
of
the
boy
voice
and
this
quality
desmond
recognized
as
he
would
have
recognized
a
fine
painting
or
a
bit
of
perfect
porcelain
all
his
short
life
his
father
had
trained
him
to
look
for
and
acclaim
quality
whether
in
things
animate
or
inanimate
he
caught
hold
of
scaife
arm
make
an
ass
of
himself
he
whispered
back
not
he
but
he
may
make
an
ass
of
me
even
as
he
spoke
he
was
aware
that
tears
were
horribly
near
his
eyes
some
catch
in
john
voice
some
subtle
inflection
had
smitten
his
heart
even
as
the
prophet
smote
the
rock
rot
said
scaife
angrily
he
was
angry
furiously
angry
because
he
saw
that
cæsar
was
beyond
his
reach
whirled
innumerable
leagues
away
by
the
sound
of
another
voice
john
had
begun
the
second
verse
he
stared
as
if
hypnotized
straight
into
the
face
of
the
great
soldier
who
in
turn
stared
as
steadily
at
john
and
john
was
singing
like
a
lark
with
a
lark
spontaneous
delight
in
singing
with
an
ease
and
which
charmed
eye
almost
as
much
as
ear
higher
and
higher
rose
the
clear
sexless
notes
till
two
of
them
met
and
mingled
in
a
triumphant
trill
to
desmond
that
trill
was
the
answer
to
the
quavering
troubled
cadences
of
the
first
verse
the
vindication
of
the
spirit
soaring
upwards
unfettered
by
the
flesh
the
pure
spirit
not
released
from
the
pitiful
human
clay
without
a
fierce
struggle
at
that
moment
desmond
loved
the
singer
the
singer
who
called
to
him
out
of
heaven
who
summoned
his
friend
to
join
him
to
see
what
he
saw
the
vision
splendid
john
began
the
third
and
last
verse
the
famous
soldier
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
releasing
john
eyes
which
ascended
like
his
voice
till
they
met
joyfully
the
eyes
of
desmond
at
last
he
was
singing
to
his
friend
his
friend
knew
john
saw
desmond
radiant
smile
and
across
that
ocean
of
faces
he
smiled
back
then
knowing
that
he
was
nearer
to
his
friend
than
he
had
ever
been
before
he
gathered
together
his
energies
for
the
last
line
of
the
song
a
line
to
be
repeated
three
times
loudly
at
first
then
more
softly
diminishing
to
the
merest
whisper
of
sound
the
voice
celestial
melting
away
in
the
ear
of
mortals
the
master
knew
well
the
supreme
difficulty
of
producing
properly
this
last
attenuated
note
but
he
knew
also
that
john
lungs
were
strong
that
the
vocal
chords
had
never
been
strained
still
if
the
boy
breath
failed
if
anything
a
smile
a
frown
a
cough
distracted
his
attention
the
end
would
be
weakness
failure
he
wondered
why
john
was
staring
so
fixedly
in
one
direction
now
now
the
piano
crashed
out
the
last
line
but
far
above
it
dominating
it
floated
john
notes
the
master
played
the
same
bars
for
the
second
time
he
was
still
able
to
sustain
if
it
were
necessary
a
quavering
imperfect
phrase
but
john
delivered
the
second
repetition
without
a
mistake
singing
easily
from
the
chest
the
master
put
his
foot
upon
the
soft
pedal
nobody
was
watching
him
had
any
one
done
so
he
would
have
seen
the
perspiration
break
upon
the
musician
forehead
the
piano
purred
its
accompaniment
then
in
the
middle
of
the
phrase
the
master
lifted
his
hands
and
held
them
poised
above
the
instrument
john
had
to
sing
three
notes
unsupported
he
was
smiling
and
staring
at
desmond
the
first
note
came
like
a
question
from
the
heart
of
a
child
the
second
higher
up
might
have
been
interpreted
as
an
echo
to
the
innocent
interrogation
of
the
first
the
head
no
wiser
than
the
heart
but
the
third
and
last
note
had
nothing
in
it
of
interrogation
it
was
an
answer
sublime
nor
did
it
seem
to
come
from
john
at
all
but
from
above
falling
like
a
snowflake
out
of
the
sky
and
then
for
one
immeasurable
moment
john
slipped
back
to
his
seat
crimson
with
bashfulness
while
the
school
thundered
applause
the
field
marshal
shouted
encore
as
loudly
as
any
fag
but
the
head
master
whispered
we
do
encourage
a
small
boy
head
is
easily
turned
not
his
the
hero
replied
two
numbers
followed
and
then
the
school
stood
up
and
with
them
all
old
harrovians
to
sing
the
famous
national
anthem
of
harrow
forty
years
on
only
the
guests
and
the
masters
remained
seated
forty
years
on
growing
older
and
older
shorter
in
wind
as
in
memory
long
feeble
of
foot
and
rheumatic
of
shoulder
what
will
it
help
you
that
once
you
were
strong
god
give
us
bases
to
guard
or
beleaguer
games
to
play
out
whether
earnest
or
fun
fights
for
the
fearless
and
goals
for
the
eager
twenty
and
thirty
and
forty
years
on
follow
up
follow
up
follow
up
follow
up
till
the
field
ring
again
and
again
with
the
tramp
of
the
men
follow
up
as
the
hundreds
of
voices
past
and
present
indissolubly
linked
together
imposed
the
mandate
up
the
head
master
glanced
at
his
guest
but
left
unsaid
the
words
about
to
be
uttered
tears
were
trickling
down
the
cheeks
of
the
man
who
forty
years
before
had
won
his
sovereign
cross
for
valour
after
the
concert
but
before
he
left
the
the
field
marshal
asked
the
head
master
to
introduce
lawrence
and
john
and
of
course
the
head
of
the
school
when
john
came
up
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
veteran
eye
ha
ha
said
he
you
were
in
a
precious
funk
john
verney
i
was
sir
said
john
gad
do
i
know
the
feeling
well
well
he
chuckled
smiling
at
john
you
climbed
up
higher
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
what
was
it
hey
in
sir
you
sang
delightfully
tell
your
uncle
to
bring
you
to
see
me
next
time
you
are
in
town
you
must
consider
me
a
friend
he
chuckled
again
an
old
friend
and
look
ye
here
his
pleasant
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
i
dare
tip
these
tremendous
swells
but
i
feel
that
i
can
take
such
a
liberty
with
you
john
scurried
away
bursting
with
pride
feeling
to
the
core
the
strong
grip
of
the
strong
man
hearing
the
thrill
of
his
voice
the
thrill
which
had
vibrated
in
thousands
of
outside
fluff
was
awaiting
him
oh
jonathan
you
can
sing
and
no
mistake
five
six
seven
mistakes
john
answered
the
boys
laughed
john
told
fluff
what
the
hero
had
said
to
him
and
showed
the
piece
of
gold
what
ho
the
creameries
come
on
esmé
at
the
creameries
several
boys
congratulated
john
and
the
caterpillar
said
you
astonished
us
jonathan
my
soul
you
did
have
a
with
me
and
fluff
too
by
the
way
be
sure
to
keep
your
hair
clipped
close
these
singing
fellows
with
manes
may
be
lions
in
their
own
estimation
but
the
world
looks
upon
as
asses
that
not
bad
for
you
caterpillar
said
a
boy
in
the
fifth
not
my
own
said
the
caterpillar
solemnly
my
father
i
take
from
him
all
the
good
things
i
can
get
hold
of
john
polished
off
his
dringer
listening
to
the
chaff
but
his
thoughts
were
with
desmond
he
had
an
intuition
that
desmond
would
have
something
to
say
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
he
returned
to
the
manor
there
he
found
his
room
empty
john
shut
the
door
and
sat
down
looking
about
him
the
duffer
had
not
contributed
much
to
the
mural
decoration
saying
loftily
that
he
preferred
bare
walls
to
rubbishy
engravings
and
japanese
fans
but
with
curious
inconsistency
for
he
was
the
least
vain
of
mortals
he
had
bought
at
a
leaving
auction
a
mirror
once
the
property
of
a
great
buck
in
the
sixth
the
duffer
had
got
it
cheap
but
he
never
used
it
the
lower
boys
remarked
to
each
other
that
duff
did
dare
to
look
in
it
because
what
he
would
see
must
not
only
break
his
heart
but
shatter
the
glass
generally
it
hung
folded
up
close
to
the
window
and
the
duffer
said
that
it
would
come
in
handy
when
he
took
to
shaving
john
eye
rested
on
this
mirror
vacantly
at
first
then
with
gathering
intensity
presently
he
got
up
crossed
the
room
opened
the
two
folding
panels
and
examined
himself
attentively
pursing
up
his
lips
and
frowning
he
could
see
john
verney
full
face
face
and
and
he
could
see
the
back
of
his
head
where
an
obstinate
lock
of
hair
stuck
out
like
a
drake
tail
john
was
so
occupied
in
taking
stock
of
his
personal
disadvantages
that
a
ringing
laugh
quite
startled
him
why
jonathan
giving
yourself
a
treat
eh
john
turned
a
solemn
face
to
desmond
i
think
my
head
is
hideous
he
said
ruefully
what
do
you
mean
it
too
long
john
explained
i
like
a
nice
round
head
like
yours
cæsar
i
wish
i
was
so
ugly
desmond
laughed
john
always
amused
him
cæsar
was
easily
amused
saw
the
funny
side
of
things
and
contrasts
tickled
his
fancy
agreeably
but
he
stopped
laughing
when
he
realized
that
john
was
hurt
then
quickly
impulsively
he
said
your
head
is
all
right
old
jonathan
and
your
voice
is
simply
beautiful
he
spoke
seriously
staring
at
john
as
he
had
stared
in
the
when
john
began
to
sing
i
came
here
to
tell
you
that
i
felt
odd
when
you
were
singing
quite
weepsy
you
know
you
like
me
old
jonathan
do
you
awfully
said
john
why
did
you
look
at
me
when
you
sang
that
last
verse
did
you
know
that
you
were
looking
at
me
yes
you
looked
at
me
because
well
because
bar
chaff
you
liked
me
yes
you
you
like
me
better
than
any
other
fellow
in
the
school
yes
better
than
any
other
fellow
in
the
world
is
it
possible
i
have
always
felt
that
way
since
yes
since
the
very
first
minute
i
saw
you
how
rum
i
forgotten
just
where
we
did
meet
for
the
first
time
i
shall
never
forget
said
john
in
the
same
slow
deliberate
fashion
never
taking
his
eyes
from
desmond
face
ever
since
he
had
sung
he
had
known
that
this
moment
was
coming
i
shall
never
forget
it
he
repeated
never
you
were
standing
near
the
chapel
i
was
poking
about
alone
trying
to
find
the
shop
where
we
buy
our
straws
and
i
was
feeling
as
all
new
boys
feel
only
more
so
because
i
did
know
a
soul
yes
said
desmond
gravely
you
told
me
that
i
remember
now
i
mistook
you
for
young
hardacre
you
smiled
at
me
cæsar
it
warmed
me
through
and
through
i
suppose
that
when
a
fellow
is
starving
he
never
forgets
the
first
meal
after
it
i
say
go
on
this
is
awfully
interesting
i
can
remember
what
you
wore
one
of
your
bootlaces
had
burst
well
i
i
had
a
wild
sort
of
wish
to
run
off
and
buy
you
a
new
lace
of
all
the
rum
starts
i
afterwards
john
continued
i
tried
to
i
asked
you
to
come
and
have
some
do
you
remember
i
bet
i
came
jonathan
no
you
did
you
said
dash
it
all
i
certainly
said
thanks
i
dare
say
but
the
hurt
awfully
because
i
did
feel
that
it
was
cheek
asking
you
jonathan
you
funny
old
buster
i
never
say
again
my
word
i
wo
so
i
said
that
odd
because
it
not
easy
for
me
to
say
the
governor
pointed
that
out
last
hols
somehow
i
say
particularly
if
there
any
excitement
in
saying
and
my
beastly
hurt
did
it
well
i
very
sorry
he
held
out
his
hand
which
john
took
then
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
before
desmond
continued
awkwardly
you
know
jonathan
that
the
demon
is
my
pal
you
like
him
better
than
you
did
do
you
john
had
the
tact
not
to
speak
but
he
shook
his
head
dolefully
and
i
could
chuck
him
even
if
i
wanted
to
which
i
do
which
i
do
he
repeated
with
an
air
of
satisfying
himself
rather
than
john
and
john
divined
that
scaife
hold
upon
desmond
affections
was
not
so
strong
as
he
had
deemed
it
to
be
desmond
continued
but
i
want
you
too
old
jonathan
and
if
if
all
right
said
john
nobly
he
perceived
that
desmond
loyalty
to
scaife
made
him
hesitate
and
flush
i
understand
cæsar
and
if
i
be
first
let
me
be
second
only
remember
with
me
you
first
rain
or
shine
desmond
looked
uneasy
is
that
a
case
of
i
win
tails
you
lose
john
considered
then
he
smiled
cheerfully
you
know
you
are
a
winner
cæsar
you
cut
out
for
a
winner
you
can
win
whatever
you
want
to
win
oh
that
all
rot
said
desmond
he
looked
very
grave
and
in
his
eyes
lay
shadows
which
john
had
never
seen
before
and
so
ended
john

year

harrow

to

a
gr
reat
deal
to

said
mr
dooley
when
john
returned
to
the
hill
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
term
the
great
change
had
taken
place
rutford
had
assumed
the
duties
of
professor
of
greek
at
a
scotch
university
warde
was
in
possession
of
the
manor
scaife
and
desmond
and
john
but
not
the
caterpillar
had
got
their
remove
they
were
fifth
form
boys
and
in
tails
john
it
is
true
although
tougher
and
broader
was
still
short
for
his
years
and
juvenile
of
appearance
but
scaife
and
desmond
were
quite
big
fellows
and
their
new
coats
became
them
mightily
trieve
was
head
of
the
house
lovell
captain
of
the
house
football
eleven
and
in
the
lower
sixth
lovell
will
have
to
behave
himself
now
the
duffer
remarked
to
scaife
who
laughed
derisively
as
he
answered
he
could
even
if
he
tried
warde
welcomed
the
house
at
and
introduced
the
boys
to
his
wife
and
daughter
warde
had
a
plain
pleasant
face
miss
warde
however
was
a
beauty
and
she
knew
it
the
coquette
and
had
known
it
from
the
hour
she
could
peep
into
a
mirror
the
caterpillar
pronounced
her
fetching
being
only
fifteen
she
wore
her
hair
in
a
plait
tied
by
a
huge
bow
and
the
hem
of
her
skirt
barely
touched
the
neatest
ankle
on
harrow
hill
give
her
a
saucy
face
pop
a
pert
nose
into
the
middle
of
it
just
above
a
pouting
red
mouth
and
just
below
her
father
eyes
and
you
will
see
iris
warde
her
hair
was
reddish
not
red
call
it
warm
chestnut
and
she
had
a
dimple
after
the
introductions
mother
and
daughter
left
the
hall
warde
stood
up
inviting
the
house
to
sit
down
warde
was
about
half
the
width
of
the
late
rutford
but
somehow
he
seemed
to
take
up
more
room
he
had
spent
the
summer
holidays
in
switzerland
climbing
terrific
peaks
snow
and
sun
had
coloured
his
clear
complexion
john
who
saw
beneath
tanned
skins
reflected
that
warde
seemed
to
be
saturated
with
fresh
air
and
all
the
sweet
clean
things
which
one
associates
with
mountains
he
loves
hills
thought
john
and
he
loves
our
hill
warde
began
to
speak
in
his
jerky
confidential
tones
dirty
dick
had
always
been
insufferably
dull
pompous
and
didactic
i
do
like
speechmaking
said
warde
but
i
want
to
put
one
thing
to
you
as
strongly
as
a
man
may
i
have
always
wished
to
be
master
of
the
manor
some
men
may
think
mine
a
small
ambition
master
of
a
house
at
harrow
nothing
big
about
that
perhaps
not
but
i
think
it
big
and
it
is
big
for
me
understand
that
i
in
love
with
my
job
head
over
heels
i
sooner
be
master
of
the
manor
than
prime
minister
i
tackle
his
work
enough
of
that
now
forget
for
a
moment
that
i
a
master
let
me
talk
as
an
old
harrovian
an
old
manorite
who
remembers
everything
ay
everything
good
and
bad
some
lucky
fellows
remember
the
good
only
we
call
them
optimists
others
remember
the
bad
pessimists
those
put
me
between
the
two
the
other
day
i
had
an
eye
eye
fixed
on
the
top
of
a
certain
peak
by
jove
how
i
longed
to
reach
that
peak
but
the
other
eye
was
on
a
at
my
feet
had
i
kept
both
eyes
on
the
peak
i
should
be
lying
now
at
the
bottom
of
that
you
take
me
well
twenty
years
ago
i
sat
here
in
hall
my
last
night
in
the
old
house
and
i
hoped
that
one
day
i
might
come
back
why
this
is
between
ourselves
a
confidence
i
came
to
the
manor
from
a
beastly
school
such
schools
are
hardly
to
be
found
nowadays
a
hardened
young
sinner
at
thirteen
the
manor
licked
me
into
shape
speaking
generally
i
suppose
the
tone
of
the
house
insensibly
communicated
itself
to
me
the
manor
was
at
games
and
work
i
began
by
shirking
both
but
the
spirit
of
the
hill
was
too
much
for
me
i
could
shirk
that
some
jolly
old
boys
we
all
know
them
and
like
them
are
always
saying
that
their
early
were
the
happiest
of
their
lives
they
fond
of
telling
this
big
lie
just
as
settling
down
to
their
claret
i
really
believe
that
they
believe
what
they
say
but
it
a
lie
the
smallest
boy
here
knows
it
a
lie
let
hark
back
a
bit
i
said
i
was
licked
into
shape
and
i
mean
i
had
a
lot
of
really
hard
fagging
much
harder
than
any
of
you
boys
know
i
was
sent
up
and
swished
i
had
whoppings
innumerable
and
it
was
pleasant
my
mother
had
pinched
herself
to
send
me
here
because
my
father
had
been
here
before
me
and
i
wondered
why
she
did
it
at
that
time
i
could
see
why
cheaper
schools
should
be
not
only
as
good
as
harrow
but
perhaps
better
not
till
i
was
in
the
fifth
did
i
get
a
glimmering
of
what
my
mother
and
the
manor
were
doing
for
me
when
i
got
into
the
sixth
and
into
the
eleven
i
knew
and
my
last
year
here
made
up
and
more
too
for
the
previous
four
i
enjoyed
that
year
thoroughly
i
had
ceased
to
be
a
slacker
i
tell
you
all
of
you
that
happiness
like
liberty
must
be
earned
before
we
can
enjoy
it
and
you
are
sent
here
to
earn
it
i
not
going
to
keep
you
much
longer
i
have
come
to
the
marrow
of
the
matter
i
owe
the
manor
a
debt
which
i
hope
to
pay
to
you
just
as
you
in
turn
will
pay
back
to
boys
not
yet
born
the
money
your
people
have
gladly
spent
on
you
and
other
greater
things
besides
i
want
to
see
this
house
at
the
top
of
the
tree
again
at
cricket
at
footer
with
a
balliol
scholar
in
it
and
a
school
and
now
dumbleton
is
going
to
bring
in
a
little
champagne
we
drink
high
health
and
fellowship
to
the
manor
and
the
hill
his
face
broke
into
the
smile
his
form
knew
so
well
he
sat
down
as
the
house
roared
its
welcome
to
a
friend
as
soon
as
the
champagne
was
drunk
dumber
was
careful
to
put
more
froth
than
wine
into
the
glasses
of
the
kids
the
boys
filed
out
of
the
hall
the
duffer
desmond
john
and
the
caterpillar
assembled
in
room
desmond
you
may
be
sure
was
afire
with
resolution
warde
was
the
right
sort
a
clinker
a
first
flighter
and
he
meant
to
stick
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
john
said
nothing
the
caterpillar
drawled
out
warde
did
surprise
me
much
i
found
out
that
he
one
of
the
wardes
of
the
real
old
stuff
our
families
intermarried
in
elizabeth
reign
chance
to
do
it
again
caterpillar
said
the
duffer
warde
daughter
is
an
uncommonly
pretty
girl
then
the
caterpillar
used
the
epithet
fetching
she
fetching
very
fetching
he
said
it
a
pleasure
to
remember
that
we
of
kin
one
must
be
civil
to
warde
he
a
well
bred
you
think
too
much
of
family
said
desmond
replied
the
caterpillar
solemnly
one
knows
that
family
is
not
everything
but
other
things
being
equal
it
means
refinement
the
first
of
the
howards
was
a
swineherd
i
dare
say
but
generations
of
education
of
association
with
the
best
have
turned
them
from
into
gentlemen
and
it
takes
generations
to
do
it
good
old
caterpillar
said
the
duffer
not
my
own
said
the
caterpillar
adding
as
usual
my
governor
you
know
warde
has
a
soft
job
ahead
of
him
said
desmond
soft
or
hard
he
handle
it
his
own
way
desmond
went
out
wondering
what
had
become
of
scaife
scaife
was
in
his
room
talking
to
lovell
senior
who
spent
a
fortnight
with
people
in
scotland
fishing
and
grousing
desmond
had
been
asked
also
but
his
father
rather
to
cæsar
disgust
for
the
scaife
moor
was
famous
had
refused
to
let
him
go
lovell
and
scaife
were
arguing
about
something
which
desmond
could
not
understand
i
left
it
to
my
partner
said
scaife
and
the
fool
went
no
trumps
holding
two
missing
suits
the
enemy
doubled
my
partner
redoubled
and
the
others
redoubled
again
that
made
it
a
trick
the
fellow
on
the
left
held
my
partner
missing
suits
he
made
the
little
slam
and
scored
nearly
six
hundred
below
the
line
it
gave
the
rubber
too
and
i
had
to
fork
out
a
couple
of
quid
what
are
you
jawing
about
demon
said
desmond
bridge
it
the
new
game
it
going
to
be
the
rage
do
you
play
bridge
cæsar
no
i
want
to
learn
it
all
right
i
must
teach
you
we
could
get
up
a
four
in
this
house
said
lovell
we
three
and
the
caterpillar
he
plays
i
know
the
colonel
is
one
of
the
cracks
at
the
turf
it
would
be
an
awful
lark
a
mild
gamble
small
points
eh
a
bob
a
hundred
what
do
you
say
cæsar
desmond
hesitated
bridge
had
not
yet
reached
its
delirious
stage
but
desmond
had
seen
it
played
had
heard
his
father
praise
it
as
the
most
fascinating
of
and
had
determined
to
learn
it
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
none
the
less
warde
words
still
echoed
in
his
ear
i
think
we
ought
to
give
warde
a
chance
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
you
were
taken
in
by
him
said
lovell
contemptuously
desmond
burst
into
enthusiastic
praise
of
warde
and
his
methods
lovell
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
out
of
the
room
nodding
to
scaife
but
ignoring
desmond
you
must
go
canny
with
lovell
said
scaife
he
the
fellow
who
ought
to
give
you
your
after
the
first
never
mind
that
you
wo
play
bridge
demon
will
you
why
not
said
scaife
where
the
harm
your
governor
plays
yes
but
you
afraid
of
getting
sacked
i
not
all
right
i
take
that
back
you
not
a
funk
cæsar
but
you
so
easily
humbugged
warde
caught
you
with
his
jaw
and
a
glass
of
gooseberry
the
champagne
was
all
right
was
it
oh
ho
so
you
do
mean
to
stand
in
with
warde
against
lovell
and
me
thanks
for
being
so
candid
now
i
be
candid
with
you
i
like
lovell
there
no
nonsense
about
him
he
do
put
on
frills
because
he
in
the
sixth
and
he
do
mean
to
take
to
their
sneaking
spying
ways
he
just
as
anxious
as
warde
to
see
the
manor
at
footer
and
cricket
and
i
as
keen
as
he
is
but
we
stop
there
the
balliol
scholarship
may
go
hang
and
as
for
sympathy
and
fellowship
and
pulling
together
between
masters
and
boys
i
never
did
believe
in
it
and
never
shall
my
hand
is
against
the
masters
so
long
as
they
interfere
with
anything
i
want
to
do
i
like
bridge
and
i
mean
to
play
it
and
take
jolly
good
care
that
i
not
nailed
that
part
of
the
fun
as
the
drinking
used
to
be
i
chucked
that
because
it
was
good
enough
but
bridge
is
ripping
and
take
my
word
for
it
you
be
keener
than
i
when
you
begin
perhaps
but
i
not
going
to
begin
here
right
oh
scaife
turned
aside
whistling
but
out
of
the
corner
of
his
shrewd
eye
he
marked
the
expression
of
desmond
face
the
colour
ebbing
and
flowing
in
the
round
boyish
cheeks
the
perplexity
on
the
brow
then
he
spoke
in
a
different
voice
do
worry
old
chap
you
stuck
to
me
through
thick
and
thin
and
i
grateful
really
and
truly
you
right
and
i
wrong
i
always
am
wrong
i
was
looking
forward
to
larks
if
you
count
purple
sins
i
do
blame
you
for
letting
me
go
to
the
devil
by
myself
i
never
said
bridge
was
a
purple
sin
warde
thinks
it
is
if
you
going
to
look
at
life
here
with
his
eyes
you
have
to
rename
things
babies
play
beggar
my
neighbour
for
chocolates
why
should
we
play
bridge
for
a
bob
a
hundred
the
game
is
splendid
for
the
brain
ten
thousand
times
better
than
translating
greek
choruses
but
it
is
gambling
demon
you
ca
get
away
from
that
pooh
it
gambling
if
i
bet
you
a
that
you
wo
make
ten
runs
in
a
it
gambling
if
i
raffle
a
picture
and
you
take
a
sixpenny
ticket
are
you
going
to
give
up
that
sort
of
gambling
no
but
what
would
warde
say
to
our
system
of
work
eh
you
not
prepared
to
go
the
whole
hog
you
want
to
pick
and
choose
good
but
give
me
the
same
right
that
all
play
bridge
with
your
old
pals
or
do
play
just
as
you
please
no
more
was
said
scaife
manner
rather
than
his
matter
confounded
the
younger
and
less
experienced
boy
scaife
too
tackled
problems
which
many
men
prefer
to
leave
alone
here
heredity
cropped
up
scaife
sire
and
grandsire
were
earning
their
bread
before
they
were
sixteen
of
necessity
they
faced
and
overcame
obstacles
which
the
ordinary
public
never
meets
till
he
leaves
the
university
for
some
time
after
this
bridge
was
not
mentioned
lovell
acting
possibly
under
advice
from
scaife
treated
desmond
courteously
and
gave
him
his
fez
after
the
first
both
boys
now
were
members
of
the
manor
cricket
and
football
elevens
and
as
such
persons
of
distinction
in
their
small
world
scaife
moreover
began
to
play
football
with
such
extraordinary
dash
and
brilliancy
that
it
seemed
to
be
quite
on
the
cards
that
he
might
get
his
school
flannels
this
possibility
and
the
greek
in
the
fifth
absorbed
his
energies
for
the
first
six
weeks
of
the
winter
quarter
john
had
come
back
to
room
to
prepare
work
desmond
felt
that
scaife
had
been
generous
in
proposing
that
john
should
join
them
because
in
many
small
ways
it
had
become
evident
that
the
demon
disliked
john
although
he
still
spoke
of
the
tight
place
out
of
which
john
had
hauled
him
through
scaife
john
received
his
fez
and
when
john
wore
it
for
the
first
time
scaife
came
up
and
said
smiling
i
nearly
even
with
you
verney
what
do
you
mean
said
john
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
said
scaife
winking
his
eye
maliciously
john
flushed
because
in
his
heart
he
did
know
but
when
he
told
egerton
what
scaife
had
said
that
experienced
man
of
the
world
turned
up
his
nose
just
like
him
he
said
he
wants
you
to
feel
that
he
has
wiped
out
his
debt
do
you
think
my
ought
to
have
been
given
to
young
lovell
the
caterpillar
who
played
back
for
the
manor
considered
the
question
i
do
know
he
said
you
are
pretty
nearly
equal
but
it
a
fact
that
the
demon
turned
the
scale
he
pointed
out
to
lovell
that
if
he
gave
a
to
his
young
brother
the
house
might
accuse
him
of
favouritism
that
did
the
trick
this
made
john
uneasy
and
unhappy
for
a
week
or
two
but
the
consciousness
that
another
might
be
better
entitled
to
the
coveted
fez
made
him
play
up
with
such
energy
that
he
succeeded
in
proving
to
all
critics
that
he
had
honestly
earned
what
luck
had
bestowed
on
him
during
the
last
week
of
october
john
began
those
long
walks
with
desmond
which
afterwards
he
came
to
regard
as
perhaps
the
most
delightful
hours
spent
at
harrow
scaife
detested
walking
he
had
his
father
power
of
focusing
attention
and
energy
upon
a
single
object
for
the
moment
he
was
mad
about
football
talk
about
books
scenery
people
bored
him
and
he
said
so
with
his
usual
frankness
and
impatience
of
restraint
desmond
on
the
other
hand
was
also
like
his
father
inasmuch
as
his
tastes
were
catholic
he
was
a
bit
of
a
naturalist
learned
in
the
lore
of
woods
and
fields
and
he
liked
to
talk
about
books
and
he
liked
to
talk
about
his
home
simple
john
would
sooner
hear
cæsar
talk
than
listen
to
the
heavenly
choir
so
it
came
to
pass
that
once
a
week
at
least
the
boys
would
stroll
down
the
avenue
at
orley
farm
where
anthony
trollope
sad
boyhood
was
passed
or
take
the
northwick
walk
which
winds
through
meadows
to
the
bridge
or
visit
john
lyon
farm
at
preston
or
getting
signed
for
bill
attempt
a
longer
ramble
to
ruislip
reservoir
or
oxhey
wood
or
headstone
with
its
moated
grange
or
horsington
hill
with
its
view
across
the
uxbridge
plain
very
soon
it
became
the
natural
thing
for
cæsar
to
give
john
a
glimpse
at
least
of
whatever
floated
in
and
out
of
his
mind
john
being
himself
a
creature
of
reserves
could
not
quite
understand
this
unlocking
of
doors
but
he
appreciated
his
privileges
cæsar
ingenuousness
sympathy
and
impulsiveness
seemed
the
more
enchanting
because
john
himself
was
of
the
sort
one
sunday
evening
they
were
hurrying
back
to
chapel
when
they
passed
a
woman
carrying
a
heavy
child
the
poor
creature
appeared
to
be
almost
fainting
with
fatigue
and
possibly
hunger
her
pinched
face
her
bent
figure
her
thin
garments
bespoke
a
passionate
protest
against
conditions
which
obviously
she
was
powerless
to
avert
or
control
the
boys
glanced
at
her
with
pitying
eyes
as
they
passed
then
desmond
said
quickly
i
say
jonathan
she
looks
as
if
she
was
going
to
fall
down
john
seeing
what
was
in
his
friend
mind
said
we
must
hurry
up
or
we
shall
miss
chapel
they
offered
the
woman
sixpences
and
blushes
because
through
the
tattered
shawl
might
be
seen
a
shrunken
bosom
the
woman
stared
stammered
and
burst
into
tears
we
shall
miss
chapel
john
repeated
hang
chapel
said
desmond
he
was
looking
at
the
child
when
the
woman
took
the
silver
she
let
the
child
slip
to
the
ground
where
it
lay
inert
what
the
matter
with
it
said
desmond
half
sobbing
the
woman
explained
that
the
child
had
sprained
its
ankle
i
just
about
done
she
gasped
an
the
sight
o
you
two
young
runnin
up
the
finished
me
i
ai
the
leaky
sort
she
added
fiercely
still
gasping
and
trembling
then
she
bent
down
and
tried
to
lift
the
heavy
child
which
moaned
feebly
you
run
on
jonathan
said
desmond
why
i
going
to
carry
this
kid
up
the
hill
i
help
no
hook
it
you
ass
i
wo
hook
it
between
them
they
carried
the
child
as
far
as
the
where
a
policeman
accepted
a
shilling
and
gave
in
return
a
positive
assurance
that
he
would
see
woman
and
child
to
their
destination
when
the
boys
were
alone
john
said
cæsar
well
what
a
fellow
you
are
i
would
have
thought
of
that
it
was
splendid
oh
shut
up
there
was
a
slight
pause
then
cæsar
said
defiantly
i
thought
of
carrying
that
kid
but
i
would
have
done
it
unless
known
that
every
boy
was
safe
in
chapel
i
could
have
faced
the
chaff
and
you
could
they
were
punished
for
cutting
chapel
because
cæsar
refused
to
give
the
reason
which
would
have
saved
them
i
have
told
the
truth
he
admitted
to
john
if
i
could
have
shouldered
that
kid
with
the
manorites
looking
on
john
agreed
that
this
was
an
excellent
and
a
cæsarean
he
coined
the
adjective
on
this
occasion
reason
among
the
fifth
form
boys
of
the
manor
was
a
big
youth
of
the
name
of
everybody
called
him
in
full
because
upon
his
first
appearance
at
bill
he
had
stopped
the
line
of
boys
by
refusing
to
answer
to
the
name
of
greene
my
name
said
he
in
a
shrill
pipe
is
and
we
spell
the
greene
with
a
final
was
a
type
of
boy
unhappily
too
common
at
all
public
schools
he
had
no
feeling
whatever
for
harrow
save
that
it
was
a
place
where
it
behoved
a
boy
to
escape
punishment
if
he
could
and
to
run
hot
foot
towards
anything
which
would
yield
pleasure
to
his
body
he
was
known
to
the
manorites
as
a
funk
at
footer
and
a
prodigious
consumer
of
food
at
the
creameries
his
father
having
accumulated
a
large
fortune
in
manufacturing
what
was
advertised
in
most
of
the
public
prints
as
the
imperishable
seamless
boot
gave
his
son
plenty
of
money
as
a
lower
boy
had
but
a
sorry
time
of
it
somebody
discovered
that
he
was
what
gilbert
once
described
as
an
imperfect
ablutioner
the
caterpillar
made
a
point
of
telling
new
boys
the
nature
of
the
punishment
meted
out
to
the
unclean
he
had
assisted
at
the
toshing
of
a
nasty
job
the
caterpillar
would
remark
looking
at
his
own
speckless
but
it
had
to
be
done
we
took
the
greene
person
the
caterpillar
alone
refused
to
defame
the
fine
name
of
beaumont
by
linking
it
to
greene
and
placed
him
naked
in
a
large
tosh
into
that
tosh
the
house
was
invited
to
pour
any
fluid
that
could
be
spared
one
forgets
things
but
unless
i
mistaken
the
particular
used
was
made
up
of
lemonade
syrups
ink
plenty
of
that
milk
i
bought
a
quart
myself
paraffin
and
a
cake
of
sapolio
monkey
brand
we
scrubbed
the
yahoo
thoroughly
washed
its
teeth
ears
hair
and
then
we
dried
it
i
do
know
who
smeared
marmalade
on
to
the
towel
but
the
drying
part
was
not
very
successful
rather
tough
eh
yes
very
tough
on
but
effective
the
greene
person
has
toshed
regularly
ever
since
at
least
so
i
told
i
never
go
near
him
myself
and
he
considerate
enough
to
keep
out
of
my
way
had
not
it
is
true
the
appetite
for
reckless
breaking
of
the
law
which
distinguished
lovell
and
his
particular
pals
but
lovell
good
qualities
cancelled
to
a
certain
extent
what
was
vicious
a
fine
cricketer
a
plucky
he
might
have
proved
a
credit
to
his
house
had
a
master
other
than
dirty
dick
been
originally
in
command
of
it
before
he
was
out
of
the
shell
he
had
declared
war
against
authority
on
the
other
hand
detested
games
and
sneered
at
those
who
played
them
pulpy
pimply
gross
in
mind
and
body
he
stood
for
that
heavy
amorphous
resistance
to
good
which
is
so
difficult
to
overcome
during
the
first
half
of
the
winter
quarter
john
saw
but
little
of
esmé
kinloch
it
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
a
public
school
that
the
boys
as
in
the
greater
world
for
which
it
is
a
preparation
are
in
layers
some
layers
overlap
others
never
touch
fluff
was
a
fag
his
friend
john
was
in
the
fifth
form
and
a
fez
in
a
word
an
atlantic
rolled
between
them
john
however
would
often
give
fluff
a
con
and
occasionally
they
would
walk
together
fluff
was
no
longer
the
delicate
girlish
child
of
a
year
ago
he
had
bloomed
into
a
very
handsome
boy
attractive
like
all
the
members
of
his
mother
family
with
engaging
manners
and
he
had
also
shown
signs
of
developing
into
a
cricketer
fluff
could
paddle
his
own
canoe
provided
of
course
that
he
kept
out
of
the
rapids
but
about
the
middle
of
the
term
john
noticed
that
fluff
was
losing
colour
and
spirits
the
latter
never
very
exuberant
it
was
not
in
john
nature
to
ask
questions
which
he
might
answer
for
himself
by
taking
pains
to
do
so
he
watched
fluff
closely
then
he
demanded
bluntly
what
up
nothing
that
a
cram
said
john
severely
i
did
believe
you
tell
me
a
cram
esmé
you
do
care
tuppence
whether
i
tell
crams
or
not
john
weighed
the
now
deliberately
that
another
cram
he
said
slowly
has
anybody
been
rotting
you
silence
john
repeated
the
question
still
silence
then
john
added
you
know
esmé
that
i
shall
stick
to
you
till
i
find
out
what
up
so
you
may
as
well
save
time
by
telling
me
at
once
it
faltered
fluff
that
fat
beast
what
he
done
he
has
done
much
yet
tell
everything
he
came
into
my
room
one
night
and
turned
me
up
in
my
bed
i
woke
on
my
head
in
the
dark
and
could
think
what
had
happened
it
was
simply
awful
then
i
heard
his
beastly
voice
saying
i
let
you
down
will
you
do
what
i
ask
you
i
have
promised
anything
to
get
out
of
that
horrible
choking
prison
and
now
he
threatens
to
turn
me
up
every
night
and
i
dream
of
it
go
on
said
john
grimly
no
you
need
go
on
i
can
guess
what
this
low
cad
is
up
to
he
said
he
be
my
friend
as
if
i
have
a
beast
like
that
for
a
friend
did
you
tell
him
that
yes
i
did
you
a
esmé
and
he
made
it
warm
for
you
ever
since
yes
but
he
has
turned
you
up
again
but
he
will
i
almost
sooner
he
do
it
and
have
done
with
it
i
ca
sleep
now
do
be
a
silly
fool
john
commanded
i
going
to
think
this
out
and
i
bet
i
make
that
fat
pimply
beast
sit
up
and
howl
thanks
awfully
john
but
the
more
john
thought
of
what
he
had
undertaken
to
do
the
less
clearly
he
saw
his
way
to
do
it
evidently
was
too
prudent
to
bully
fluff
he
had
resorted
to
the
crueller
alternative
of
terrorizing
him
lawrence
would
have
settled
this
fellow
hash
so
john
reflected
in
a
jiffy
but
trieve
miss
trieve
was
hopelessly
incapable
presently
inspiration
came
he
seized
an
opportunity
when
happened
to
be
by
himself
then
he
marched
boldly
into
his
room
leaving
the
door
ajar
hullo
what
do
you
want
was
sitting
opposite
the
fire
reading
a
novel
and
leisurely
consuming
macaroons
i
want
you
to
leave
young
kinloch
alone
nearly
choked
then
he
spluttered
out
say
that
again
will
you
i
want
you
to
leave
young
kinloch
alone
really
anything
else
nothing
more
thank
you
slowly
raised
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
glared
at
john
whose
head
came
to
his
chin
you
plenty
of
cheek
what
i
have
is
spotty
anyway
john
saw
the
veins
begin
to
swell
in
throat
he
thought
with
relief
of
the
door
ajar
but
it
was
part
of
his
policy
a
carefully
devised
policy
to
provoke
if
possible
a
scene
then
others
would
interfere
explanations
would
be
in
order
and
public
opinion
would
accomplish
the
rest
you
infernal
young
jackanapes
you
pretty
pet
get
out
of
my
room
hook
it
i
want
to
said
john
coolly
enough
although
his
heart
was
throbbing
it
horribly
fuggy
in
here
and
i
jambi
to
do
but
i
not
going
till
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
leave
young
kinloch
alone
if
you
do
walk
out
i
chuck
you
out
you
must
catch
me
first
said
john
and
then
a
very
pretty
chase
took
place
fat
scant
of
breath
full
of
macaroons
began
to
pursue
john
round
and
round
the
table
john
skilfully
interposed
chairs
anything
he
could
lay
hands
on
passing
the
washstand
he
secured
an
enormous
sponge
which
an
instant
later
flew
souse
into
the
face
of
the
grampus
an
abridged
edition
of
liddell
and
scott
greek
lexicon
followed
this
nearly
brought
the
big
fellow
to
grass
in
his
rage
he
too
began
to
hurl
what
objects
happened
to
be
within
reach
but
he
was
a
shocking
bad
shot
he
missed
or
john
dodged
every
time
john
did
not
miss
finally
as
john
had
foreseen
a
couple
of
sixth
form
fellows
rushed
in
what
the
meaning
of
this
infernal
row
asked
one
ask
him
said
john
authority
stared
at
and
then
at
his
wrecked
room
i
told
him
to
hook
it
and
he
would
spluttered
the
gasping
greene
why
half
a
dozen
other
fellows
had
come
into
the
room
amongst
them
the
duffer
and
the
caterpillar
i
wanted
to
hook
it
john
explained
because
it
so
beastly
fuggy
but
would
promise
me
to
do
something
he
ought
to
do
this
is
mysterious
the
swaggering
young
blackguard
cheeked
me
growled
greene
i
was
very
polite
at
first
pleaded
john
hook
it
now
anyway
said
authority
not
till
he
promises
if
you
turn
me
out
i
come
back
after
gone
what
is
it
you
want
him
to
promise
john
had
achieved
his
object
i
want
him
to
leave
young
kinloch
the
two
sixth
form
boys
glanced
at
each
other
at
john
at
the
gross
spotted
face
of
then
the
senior
said
coldly
i
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
promising
verney
or
any
one
else
that
you
will
leave
young
kinloch
alone
i
never
laid
a
finger
on
the
kid
growled
the
big
fellow
but
he
looked
pale
and
frightened
then
you
promise
eh
yes
on
your
word
of
honour
yes
that
night
john
told
fluff
with
great
glee
how
had
been
made
to
sit
up
and
howl

in

of
all
who
believe
that
life
was
made
for
friendship
the
immediate
result
of
the
incident
described
in
the
last
chapter
was
to
strengthen
the
bond
between
john
and
desmond
desmond
had
the
epic
from
fluff
from
the
caterpillar
and
finally
from
john
himself
you
bearded
that
poisonous
beast
in
his
den
exclaimed
he
you
plotted
and
planned
for
the
scrimmage
you
foresaw
what
would
happen
well
you
are
a
corker
jonathan
you
have
thought
of
something
much
better
not
i
desmond
replied
scaife
however
made
no
remarks
possibly
because
desmond
made
too
many
singing
john
praises
behind
his
back
and
to
his
face
in
and
out
of
season
this
of
course
was
indiscreet
and
led
to
hard
words
and
harder
feelings
realized
that
john
had
tarred
and
feathered
him
the
fags
you
may
be
sure
rubbed
the
tar
in
if
threatened
to
kick
an
impudent
fourth
form
boy
that
youngster
would
bid
him
be
careful
if
you
do
behave
yourself
he
would
say
i
shall
have
to
send
verney
to
your
room
lovell
senior
remarked
that
was
a
swine
but
that
verney
had
put
on
lift
and
must
be
snubbed
what
a
boy
who
had
not
been
two
years
in
the
school
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
the
matter
ought
to
have
been
laid
before
the
head
of
the
house
accordingly
john
found
himself
much
to
his
dismay
unpopular
with
the
olympians
the
last
month
of
this
term
was
in
some
ways
the
most
disagreeable
he
had
yet
spent
at
harrow
but
the
gain
of
desmond
friendship
far
outweighed
the
loss
of
popularity
john
tingled
with
pleasure
when
he
reflected
that
he
had
achieved
his
ambition
to
stand
between
scaife
and
desmond
at
the
same
time
he
was
uncomfortably
aware
that
scaife
seemed
to
have
climbed
high
above
desmond
who
had
stood
still
in
moments
of
depression
john
told
himself
that
he
was
a
makeshift
that
desmond
would
leave
him
and
join
the
demon
whenever
that
splendid
young
person
chose
to
whistle
him
up
scaife
had
failed
to
get
his
football
flannels
but
he
came
so
near
to
beating
all
previous
records
that
the
school
began
to
regard
him
as
a
blood
he
was
seen
with
lovell
strolling
up
and
down
the
high
street
and
the
fags
breathlessly
repeated
what
desmond
had
predicted
a
year
ago
the
demon
was
the
coming
man
and
always
when
john
and
desmond
passed
him
john
thought
he
could
read
a
derisive
triumph
upon
the
demon
handsome
face
an
expression
which
said
plainly
you
young
fool
do
you
know
that
i
playing
cat
and
mouse
with
the
three
still
met
twice
daily
to
prepare
work
but
the
moment
that
was
done
scaife
disappeared
leaving
john
and
desmond
together
he
playing
bridge
in
lovell
room
said
desmond
more
facts
were
gleaned
from
the
caterpillar
who
had
joined
the
but
played
seldom
one
draws
the
line
said
he
at
playing
for
stakes
one
ca
afford
to
lose
lovell
and
the
demon
have
made
it
too
hot
and
warde
will
make
it
hotter
said
john
not
he
replied
the
caterpillar
the
demon
is
a
wonder
thanks
to
his
brains
detection
is
impossible
he
suggested
that
lovell
room
should
be
used
warde
would
dare
to
burst
in
upon
one
of
the
sixth
and
you
ought
to
see
their
dodgy
arrangements
lovell
has
his
young
brother
on
guard
i
hanged
if
the
demon
did
invent
a
sort
of
drill
which
they
go
through
with
a
it
a
star
performance
i
tell
you
young
lovell
bolts
in
in
seconds
they
have
got
it
down
to
that
the
cards
and
markers
are
hidden
and
the
four
of
are
jawing
away
about
footer
all
the
same
said
john
obstinately
warde
will
be
too
much
for
oh
rot
said
the
caterpillar
the
manor
got
into
the
of
the
football
matches
and
when
the
school
broke
up
for
the
christmas
holidays
it
was
generally
conceded
that
the
fortunes
of
the
ancient
house
were
mending
in
the
manor
itself
warde
influence
was
hardly
yet
perceptible
only
a
very
few
knew
that
it
was
diffusing
itself
percolating
into
nooks
and
crevices
undreamed
of
the
hearts
of
the
fourth
form
for
instance
in
dirty
dick
time
there
had
been
almost
universal
slackness
in
rutford
read
a
book
boys
could
work
or
not
as
they
pleased
provided
their
tutor
was
not
disturbed
warde
on
the
other
hand
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
work
with
his
pupils
his
indefatigable
energies
his
good
humour
his
patience
were
never
so
conspicuous
as
when
he
was
coaching
duffers
in
other
ways
he
made
the
boys
realize
that
he
was
at
the
manor
for
their
advantage
not
his
own
the
gardens
and
park
were
kept
strictly
private
by
dirty
dick
warde
threw
them
open
a
favour
hardly
appreciated
in
the
whiter
quarter
but
the
house
admitted
that
it
would
be
awfully
jolly
in
the
summer
to
lie
under
the
trees
far
from
the
crowd
in
a
word
a
privilege
upon
the
last
saturday
to
john
delight
desmond
asked
him
to
spend
a
week
in
eaton
square
john
had
paid
two
visits
to
white
ladies
he
was
now
about
to
experience
something
entirely
new
white
ladies
and
verney
boscobel
were
typical
of
the
past
they
illustrated
the
history
of
the
families
who
had
inhabited
them
the
great
world
went
to
white
ladies
to
see
the
pictures
and
the
gardens
the
gobelin
tapestries
the
duchess
and
her
guests
but
the
same
world
dined
in
eaton
square
to
see
charles
desmond
during
this
visit
our
john
first
learned
what
miracles
one
individual
may
accomplish
at
white
ladies
he
had
dimly
perceived
as
has
been
said
the
duties
and
responsibilities
imposed
upon
rank
and
wealth
in
eaton
square
he
saw
more
plainly
the
duties
and
responsibilities
imposed
upon
a
man
of
great
talents
both
charles
desmond
and
the
duke
of
trent
were
hard
workers
but
the
labours
of
the
duke
seemed
to
john
and
to
other
wise
persons
charles
desmond
work
in
contrast
presented
all
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
john
left
white
ladies
thanking
his
stars
that
he
was
not
a
duke
he
came
away
from
eaton
square
filled
with
the
ambition
to
be
private
secretary
to
the
great
minister
and
when
desmond
said
to
him
with
his
genial
smile
well
young
john
harry
i
hope
will
be
my
secretary
and
the
crutch
of
my
declining
years
but
what
would
you
like
to
be
john
replied
fervently
oh
sir
i
should
like
to
be
harry
understudy
would
you
and
then
john
saw
the
face
of
his
kind
host
change
the
smile
faded
desmond
had
taken
his
answer
as
john
meant
it
to
be
taken
seriously
he
examined
john
as
if
he
were
already
a
candidate
for
office
the
piercing
eyes
probed
deep
then
he
said
slowly
i
should
like
to
have
you
under
me
john
we
shall
talk
of
this
again
my
boy
my
own
sons
he
paused
sighed
and
then
laughed
tapping
john
cheek
with
his
slender
fingers
but
he
passed
on
without
finishing
his
sentence
john
knew
that
of
cæsar
brothers
hugo
the
eldest
was
secretary
of
legation
at
teheran
bill
devilled
for
a
famous
barrister
lionel
wore
her
majesty
livery
strange
that
none
had
elected
to
serve
his
own
father
cæsar
explained
later
you
see
he
said
the
dear
old
governor
outshines
everybody
hugo
and
the
others
felt
that
under
him
they
would
be
in
eclipse
for
ever
and
ever
eh
i
see
said
john
gravely
yes
there
something
in
that
he
wants
you
cæsar
dear
old
governor
the
other
replied
yes
he
keen
on
that
but
i
hope
to
make
my
own
little
mark
i
like
to
have
my
name
on
a
brass
tablet
in
harrow
chapel
that
would
be
something
his
eyes
began
to
glow
and
sparkle
next
day
at
dinner
rodney
name
cropped
up
rodney
paved
the
way
for
nelson
desmond
observed
i
look
upon
him
as
one
of
our
greatest
harrovians
we
ought
to
have
a
building
to
rodney
memory
i
put
him
before
peel
or
byron
oh
i
say
father
hot
protest
from
cæsar
act
before
word
harry
practice
before
precept
rodney
was
a
man
of
action
i
should
like
to
have
been
rodney
i
should
like
to
have
been
sheridan
said
cæsar
i
often
look
at
his
name
on
the
third
panel
of
the
fourth
form
room
he
glanced
at
his
father
who
smiled
knowing
that
a
delicate
compliment
was
intended
for
enthusiastic
admirers
had
spoken
of
charles
desmond
as
the
richard
brinsley
sheridan
of
the
modern
house
of
commons
the
father
said
curtly
a
my
dear
harry
then
he
turned
to
john
and
of
all
our
famous
harrovians
whom
would
you
like
to
take
as
a
pattern
young
john
john
hesitated
two
or
three
of
the
guests
present
were
celebrities
amongst
them
was
england
greatest
critic
sitting
beside
an
ambassador
there
happened
to
be
a
lull
in
the
talk
all
looked
curiously
at
john
i
like
to
be
another
lord
shaftesbury
he
said
slowly
good
capital
desmond
nodded
his
head
i
knew
him
well
he
poured
out
anecdote
after
anecdote
illustrating
the
character
and
temperament
of
the
his
his
devotion
to
an
ideal
his
curious
exclusiveness
his
refinement
his
faith
in
an
aristocracy
never
diminished
by
the
indefatigable
zeal
wherein
he
laboured
to
better
the
condition
of
the
poor
if
every
rich
man
were
animated
by
shaftesbury
spirit
said
desmond
in
conclusion
extreme
poverty
would
be
wiped
out
of
england
and
yet
we
should
retain
all
that
makes
life
charming
and
profitable
he
was
no
leveller
save
of
foul
rookeries
first
and
last
he
believed
in
order
particularly
his
own
a
true
nobleman
and
the
inspiration
of
his
great
career
came
to
him
on
the
hill
indeed
said
the
critic
john
verney
will
tell
you
all
about
it
said
desmond
glancing
cheerily
at
our
hero
his
was
ever
the
habit
to
draw
out
the
humblest
of
his
guests
so
john
recited
how
young
anthony
ashley
standing
on
the
hill
just
below
the
churchyard
chanced
to
see
a
pauper
coffin
fall
to
the
ground
and
burst
open
revealing
the
pitiful
corpse
within
and
how
he
had
exclaimed
in
horror
good
heavens
can
this
be
permitted
simply
because
the
man
was
poor
and
friendless
and
how
then
and
there
the
boy
had
sworn
to
devote
his
powers
to
the
amelioration
of
lives
yes
said
desmond
he
told
me
that
the
next
fifteen
minutes
decided
his
career
ah
he
succeeded
greatly
why
when
i
was
at
harrow
we
used
to
cross
from
waterloo
to
euston
through
some
of
the
worst
slums
in
the
world
you
boys
ca
realize
what
they
looked
like
and
shaftesbury
work
and
example
wiped
them
out
of
our
civilization
when
john
returned
to
his
uncle
house
of
verney
boscobel
his
home
since
his
father
death
cæsar
desmond
accompanied
him
then
it
seemed
to
john
that
his
cup
brimmed
that
everything
he
desired
had
been
granted
unto
him
verney
boscobel
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
great
forest
one
of
the
few
large
manors
within
that
splendid
demesne
the
boys
arrived
at
lyndhurst
road
station
late
in
the
evening
long
after
dusk
and
were
driven
in
darkness
through
bartley
and
minstead
up
to
the
moors
of
stoneycross
next
morning
early
john
woke
his
friend
and
opened
the
shutters
jolly
morning
he
said
have
a
look
at
the
forest
old
chap
cæsar
jumped
out
of
bed
and
drew
a
long
breath
ah
he
exclaimed
it
fairyland
frost
had
silvered
all
things
below
above
motionless
upon
the
blue
heavens
as
if
still
frozen
by
the
icy
fingers
of
a
december
night
were
some
aerial
transparencies
of
aqueous
vapour
amethystine
in
colour
with
edges
of
white
foam
in
the
east
obscured
but
not
concealed
by
grey
mist
hung
the
crimson
orb
of
the
sun
from
it
faint
rays
shot
forth
touching
the
clouds
beneath
which
roused
so
to
speak
out
of
sleep
drifted
lethargically
in
a
southerly
direction
underneath
the
young
grey
dawn
a
multitude
of
dense
white
fleecy
clouds
were
wandering
in
thick
flocks
shepherded
by
the
slow
unwilling
wind
desmond
drew
in
his
breath
sighing
with
purest
delight
from
the
lawns
encompassing
the
house
his
eyes
strayed
into
a
glade
of
bracken
gold
gleaming
through
silver
a
glade
shadowed
by
noble
oaks
and
beeches
with
one
birch
tree
in
the
middle
of
it
surpassingly
graceful
upon
this
each
delicate
bough
and
spray
were
outlined
sharply
against
the
sky
beyond
the
glade
stretched
the
moor
rugged
bleak
and
treeless
sloping
sharply
upward
beyond
the
moor
lay
the
forest
belts
of
firs
darkly
purple
and
flanking
these
the
irregular
masses
of
oaks
and
beeches
varying
in
tint
from
palest
lavender
to
rose
and
brown
some
still
in
shadow
some
in
glow
of
sunlight
not
one
the
same
and
each
in
itself
containing
a
thousand
differing
forms
yet
all
harmonious
parts
of
the
resplendent
whole
i
so
glad
you
like
my
home
said
john
shall
we
have
a
gallop
before
breakfast
it
only
a
white
frost
so
they
galloped
away
into
fairyland
returning
with
mortal
appetites
to
the
whence
a
verney
had
ridden
forth
to
join
his
kinsman
sir
edmund
in
arms
for
the
king
upon
the
distant
field
of
edge
hill
after
breakfast
the
boys
explored
the
quaint
old
house
and
john
showed
cæsar
the
gun
and
promised
his
guest
much
and
two
days
hunting
at
least
with
the
new
forest
hounds
and
some
and
possibly
an
encounter
with
a
big
grayling
which
later
the
boys
saw
walloping
about
in
the
test
above
broadlands
a
splendid
fish
once
hooked
by
john
and
lost
a
of
course
o
golden
age
you
will
never
forget
that
christmas
will
you
john
if
you
live
to
be
prime
minister
of
england
the
memory
of
those
first
days
alone
with
your
friend
will
remain
green
when
the
colour
has
been
sucked
by
time
out
of
everything
else
fifty
years
hence
maybe
you
will
see
cæsar
curly
head
and
his
blue
eyes
full
of
fun
and
life
and
you
will
hear
his
joyous
laughter
peal
upon
peal
echoing
through
the
corridors
of
verney
boscobel
your
mother
took
him
to
her
heart
did
she
and
all
the
servants
from
butler
to
scullery
maid
voted
him
the
jolliest
cheeriest
boy
that
ever
came
to
hampshire
why
osman
the
cook
with
a
temper
like
tinder
from
too
much
heat
refused
flatly
to
let
cæsar
make
toffee
in
her
kitchen
but
just
then
a
turned
up
and
before
she
could
open
her
mouth
cæsar
was
dancing
a
polka
with
her
and
after
that
he
could
make
toffee
or
hay
or
anything
else
wherever
and
whenever
he
pleased
when
they
returned
to
the
manor
john
hoped
and
prayed
that
this
blessed
intimacy
would
continue
it
did
for
a
time
the
three
boys
got
their
remove
and
found
themselves
in
the
second
fifth
where
they
proposed
to
linger
till
after
the
summer
term
lovell
and
scaife
seemed
inseparable
and
bridge
began
again
apparently
an
inexhaustible
source
of
amusement
and
excitement
then
came
the
torpid
matches
and
john
as
lawrence
predicted
was
captain
of
the
eleven
the
first
great
victory
of
the
manorites
during
the
term
scaife
and
desmond
won
no
races
being
in
age
betwixt
and
between
winners
of
upper
and
lower
school
races
scaife
refused
to
train
desmond
took
a
few
runs
but
abandoned
them
for
racquets
the
chief
game
in
the
easter
term
but
only
played
regularly
by
boys
whose
purses
are
well
lined
john
confined
his
attention
to
squash
cæsar
played
harder
with
the
demon
the
three
worked
together
as
of
yore
john
now
perceived
that
scaife
had
joined
a
clique
pledged
to
fight
reform
it
was
in
the
air
that
something
might
happen
warde
eyed
the
big
fellows
shrewdly
as
if
measuring
weapons
he
confounded
some
by
asking
them
to
dine
with
him
at
dessert
he
would
talk
of
sport
or
games
or
politics
everything
in
fine
except
shop
the
more
worthy
came
away
from
these
pleasant
evenings
with
rather
a
hangdog
expression
as
if
they
had
been
receiving
goods
under
false
pretences
john
and
desmond
were
made
especially
welcome
and
after
dinner
john
whose
voice
had
not
yet
cracked
would
sing
to
warde
accompaniment
such
songs
as
o
bay
of
dublin
my
heart
throublin
or
think
of
me
sometimes
or
handel
you
walk
the
caterpillar
made
no
secret
of
a
passion
for
iris
warde
and
became
a
dangerous
rival
of
one
of
the
younger
masters
he
talked
to
warde
about
genealogies
and
hunting
topics
of
conversation
in
which
they
had
a
common
interest
outside
harrow
john
guessed
that
warde
was
making
an
effort
to
secure
egerton
who
for
his
part
took
the
world
as
he
found
it
consorting
alike
with
john
and
his
friends
and
also
with
lovell
and
from
the
caterpillar
john
learned
that
had
begun
to
play
bridge
scaife
and
lovell
are
skinning
the
beast
he
added
confidentially
green
he
is
and
no
error
ructions
soon
said
john
i
do
believe
it
replied
the
caterpillar
take
my
word
warde
knows
what
he
about
he
playing
up
to
the
younger
members
of
the
house
you
cæsar
and
you
jonathan
and
he
letting
the
others
slide
giving
rope
said
john
to
hang
well
now
there
something
in
that
that
had
occurred
to
me
what
you
think
that
he
eggin
on
eh
eggin
on
i
think
that
if
i
were
you
caterpillar
i
cut
loose
from
that
gang
they
made
it
rather
warm
for
you
i
do
care
a
hang
about
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
john
life
had
been
made
very
unpleasant
by
the
fast
set
upon
the
other
hand
the
duffer
fluff
and
many
lower
school
boys
reckoned
him
their
leader
and
adviser
and
such
is
the
irony
of
fate
john
popularity
with
friends
caused
him
more
anxiety
than
unpopularity
with
enemies
towards
the
end
of
the
term
desmond
spoke
of
applying
to
warde
for
a
certain
room
to
be
shared
by
himself
and
john
john
had
to
decline
an
arrangement
desired
passionately
because
he
had
indiscreetly
promised
not
to
chuck
the
duffer
cæsar
dropped
the
subject
after
this
john
noticed
a
slight
coldness
he
wondered
whether
cæsar
were
jealous
jealousy
being
john
own
besetting
sin
finally
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
friend
might
be
not
jealous
but
unreasonable
in
any
case
during
the
last
three
weeks
of
the
term
john
saw
less
of
cæsar
and
more
more
indeed
than
he
wanted
of
the
duffer
and
fluff
and
then
came
the
paralysing
news
that
desmond
had
promised
to
spend
ten
days
with
scaife
people
that
a
professional
had
been
hired
and
that
both
boys
were
going
to
give
their
undivided
energies
to
cricket
afterwards
john
often
wondered
whether
scaife
with
truly
demoniac
insight
into
desmond
character
had
let
him
go
so
as
to
seize
him
with
more
tenacious
grasp
when
an
opportunity
presented
itself
as
soon
as
john
saw
cæsar
after
the
easter
holidays
he
knew
that
temporarily
at
any
rate
he
had
lost
his
friend
cæsar
indeed
was
demonstratively
glad
to
see
him
and
dragged
him
off
next
day
to
walk
to
a
certain
bridge
where
a
few
short
weeks
before
the
boys
had
carved
their
names
upon
the
wooden
railing
surrounding
them
with
a
circle
and
the
crossed
arrows
but
cæsar
could
talk
of
nothing
else
but
scaife
and
cricket
they
had
both
come
on
tremendously
scaife
people
had
a
splendid
poor
john
if
he
could
have
submerged
the
scaife
and
the
scaife
family
by
nodding
his
head
i
fear
that
he
would
have
nodded
it
although
he
told
himself
that
he
was
an
ungenerous
beast
and
cad
not
to
sympathize
with
his
pal
and
before
the
boys
got
back
to
the
manor
cæsar
said
not
without
a
blush
that
he
had
learned
to
play
bridge
i
shall
teach
you
jonathan
no
i
say
yes
you
not
going
to
play
with
lovell
and
that
beast
the
demon
says
no
cards
this
term
when
late
and
look
here
jonathan
i
made
the
demon
promise
to
make
the
peace
between
lovell
and
you
you
play
for
the
house
of
course
and
we
must
all
pull
together
as
warde
says
john
might
have
smiled
at
this
opportune
mention
of
warde
but
sense
of
humour
was
swamped
in
apprehension
desmond
went
on
to
talk
about
scaife
he
make
sit
up
you
see
the
we
had
is
the
finest
in
england
i
never
saw
such
a
chap
he
dashes
at
the
ball
hit
it
as
hard
as
you
please
he
runs
in
picks
it
up
and
snaps
it
back
to
the
as
easy
as
if
he
was
playing
pitch
and
toss
and
by
jove
the
demon
can
do
it
you
wait
i
never
saw
any
fellow
like
him
he
only
just
sixteen
and
he
get
his
flannels
you
need
shake
your
old
head
i
know
he
will
and
we
must
work
like
blazes
to
get
ours
next
summer
john
discounted
much
of
this
talk
but
he
soon
found
out
that
cæsar
had
not
overestimated
the
demon
activity
the
draw
at
lord
in
the
previous
summer
had
been
attributed
by
such
experts
as
webbe
and
hornby
to
bad
fielding
the
demon
told
john
with
his
hateful
derisive
smile
that
he
had
remembered
this
when
he
selected
a
pro
not
for
the
first
time
john
realized
scaife
overpowering
ability
to
achieve
his
own
ends
who
but
scaife
would
have
made
fielding
the
principal
object
of
his
holiday
practice
within
a
fortnight
scaife
was
put
into
the
sixth
form
game
desmond
found
himself
thanks
to
scaife
playing
in
the
first
fifth
game
but
john
was
placed
in
second
fifth
beta
fortunately
he
found
an
ally
in
warde
who
had
a
private
pitch
in
the
small
park
surrounding
the
manor
where
he
coached
the
weaker
players
of
his
house
john
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
get
his
cap
but
as
the
weeks
slipped
by
despite
several
creditable
performances
he
became
aware
that
the
cap
was
withheld
although
it
had
been
given
to
fluff
there
were
five
vacancies
in
the
house
eleven
but
according
to
precedent
these
need
not
be
filled
up
till
after
the
last
and
possibly
not
even
then
in
a
word
john
might
play
for
the
house
and
even
distinguish
himself
without
receiving
the
coveted
distinction
how
sore
john
felt
about
the
end
of
may
he
noticed
that
something
was
amiss
with
cæsar
generally
they
walked
together
on
sunday
but
not
always
during
these
walks
as
has
been
said
cæsar
did
most
of
the
talking
now
of
a
sudden
he
became
a
listener
and
to
john
repeated
question
what
up
he
would
reply
irritably
oh
bother
nothing
finally
john
heard
from
the
caterpillar
that
cæsar
was
playing
bridge
and
losing
they
do
play
often
the
caterpillar
added
but
on
wet
afternoons
they
make
up
for
lost
time
cæsar
is
outclassed
i
told
him
but
mad
keen
about
the
game
later
john
learned
from
the
same
source
that
sunday
afternoon
was
a
with
lovell
and
at
any
rate
cæsar
did
not
play
on
sunday
that
was
something
upon
the
following
saturday
after
making
an
honest
fifteen
runs
and
taking
three
wickets
in
a
game
john
was
running
into
the
yard
just
before
six
bill
when
lovell
stopped
him
you
can
get
your
he
said
coldly
oh
thanks
thanks
awfully
cæsar
received
this
agreeable
news
with
indifference
you
ought
to
have
had
it
before
fluff
he
growled
we
walk
to
john
lyon
farm
said
john
eagerly
engaged
cæsar
replied
oh
cæsar
you
you
well
you
going
to
play
bridge
yes
what
of
it
it
only
once
in
a
way
i
bar
cards
on
sunday
but
there
are
reasons
what
reasons
reasons
which
er
i
keep
to
myself
all
right
said
john
stiffly
but
with
a
breaking
heart
next
day
he
asked
fluff
to
walk
with
him
but
fluff
was
walking
with
some
one
else
the
duffer
had
letters
to
write
and
stigmatized
walking
as
a
beastly
grind
john
determined
to
walk
by
himself
but
as
he
was
leaving
the
manor
he
met
the
caterpillar
a
tremendous
buck
arrayed
in
his
best
boots
white
waistcoat
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
where
are
you
off
to
jonathan
to
preston
you
better
come
caterpillar
i
never
walk
far
in
these
boots
peal
made
change
ca
you
right
while
he
was
absent
john
seriously
considered
the
propriety
of
taking
egerton
into
his
confidence
sincerely
attached
to
egerton
and
valuing
his
advice
he
knew
none
the
less
that
the
caterpillar
looked
at
everybody
and
everything
with
the
eyes
of
a
colonel
in
the
guards
to
tell
colonel
egerton
son
that
one
heart
was
lacerated
because
cæsar
desmond
was
playing
bridge
on
sunday
seemed
to
invite
jeers
and
besides
that
was
the
real
reason
john
felt
wretched
because
the
sunday
walk
had
been
sacrificed
to
moloch
presently
egerton
came
downstairs
spick
and
span
but
not
quite
so
smart
the
boys
walked
quickly
talking
of
cricket
the
demon
get
his
flannels
said
egerton
i
glad
lovell
gave
you
your
cap
jonathan
you
deserved
it
a
month
ago
it
was
my
fault
you
did
get
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
i
sure
of
that
said
john
gratefully
you
do
look
particularly
a
grin
improves
your
face
my
dear
fellow
at
this
john
burst
into
explosive
speech
those
beasts
had
got
hold
of
cæsar
the
caterpillar
stared
he
had
never
heard
john
let
himself
go
john
vocabulary
surprised
him
he
whistled
gad
jonathan
you
do
pile
on
the
agony
cæsar
all
right
do
worry
he
not
all
right
i
thought
cæsar
had
backbone
i
hold
on
said
the
caterpillar
gravely
john
thought
he
was
about
to
be
rebuked
for
disloyalty
to
a
pal
an
abominable
sin
in
the
caterpillar
eyes
well
said
john
i
going
to
tell
you
something
said
egerton
but
you
must
swear
not
to
give
me
away
i
swear
you
a
good
little
cove
jonathan
but
sometimes
you
smell
just
a
little
bit
of
er
bread
and
butter
keep
cool
personally
i
would
sooner
that
you
at
your
age
did
smell
of
bread
and
butter
than
whisky
well
you
think
that
cæsar
is
going
straight
to
the
because
he
plays
bridge
you
accuse
him
in
your
own
little
mind
of
feebleness
and
so
forth
yes
just
so
and
it
doosid
unfair
to
cæsar
because
given
up
his
walk
entirely
on
your
account
ah
i
thought
that
would
make
you
sit
up
my
account
john
repeated
blankly
yes
cæsar
would
be
furious
if
he
knew
that
i
was
peaching
but
he
wo
know
and
instead
of
this
er
trifling
affair
weakening
your
good
opinion
of
your
pal
it
will
strengthen
it
oh
do
go
on
caterpillar
yesterday
i
was
in
lovell
room
we
were
talking
of
the
first
house
match
scaife
and
cæsar
were
there
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
say
you
ought
to
be
given
your
and
then
cæsar
burst
out
yes
lovell
do
give
him
his
cap
if
you
knew
how
he
slaved
to
earn
it
but
lovell
only
laughed
and
then
scaife
chipped
in
here
cæsar
he
said
i
understand
that
you
put
this
thing
which
after
all
is
none
of
your
business
or
mine
as
a
favour
which
lovell
might
do
and
cæsar
answered
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
demon
and
then
scaife
laughed
i
do
like
scaife
laugh
jonathan
i
loathe
it
said
john
well
when
scaife
laughed
lovell
looked
first
at
him
and
then
at
cæsar
it
came
to
me
that
lovell
was
primed
to
say
something
at
any
rate
he
turned
to
cæsar
and
said
slowly
for
tat
if
i
do
this
for
you
will
you
do
something
for
me
and
cæsar
spoke
up
as
usual
without
a
second
hesitation
course
i
will
and
then
scaife
laughed
again
just
as
lovell
said
right
i
give
verney
his
cap
before
tea
and
you
will
make
a
fourth
at
bridge
with
us
afternoon
oh
oh
groaned
john
dash
it
all
do
look
so
wretched
there
not
much
more
cæsar
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
said
quietly
enough
personally
i
do
think
lovell
was
playing
well
cricket
but
i
do
know
that
he
wanted
a
fourth
at
bridge
because
i
just
refused
to
make
that
fourth
myself
they
play
too
high
for
me
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
have
told
me
this
pray
do
mention
it
hullo
what
up
now
john
face
was
very
red
and
his
fists
were
clenched
nothing
he
gasped
only
this
i
like
to
kill
scaife
i
like
to
cut
off
his
infernal
head
the
caterpillar
laughed
indulgently
jonathan
you
a
rum
you
think
it
wicked
to
play
cards
on
sunday
but
you
would
like
he
imitated
john
trembling
passionate
voice
you
would
like
to
cut
off
scaife
infernal
head
yes
i
would
said
john
that
same
week
he
had
a
memorable
talk
with
warde
recorded
because
it
illustrates
warde
methods
and
because
ultimately
it
came
to
be
regarded
by
john
as
the
of
his
intellectual
life
since
he
had
taken
the
lower
remove
john
energies
of
mind
and
body
had
been
concentrated
upon
improving
himself
at
games
vaguely
aware
that
some
of
the
were
within
his
grasp
he
had
not
deemed
them
worth
the
winning
to
him
therefore
warde
abruptly
began
you
pride
yourself
upon
being
straight
eh
verney
why
yes
said
john
meeting
warde
blue
eyes
not
without
misgiving
well
to
me
you
about
as
straight
as
a
note
of
interrogation
i
never
see
you
without
saying
to
myself
verney
going
to
bury
his
talents
in
the
oh
some
parents
too
many
of
them
send
their
boys
here
to
make
a
few
nice
friends
to
play
games
to
scrape
up
the
school
with
a
remove
once
a
year
that
i
take
it
is
not
what
verney
wants
n
no
sir
you
ought
to
be
in
the
sixth
and
you
know
it
twice
or
oftener
you
have
deliberately
taken
things
easy
because
you
wanted
a
soft
time
of
it
during
the
summer
term
and
because
you
wished
to
remain
in
the
same
form
with
desmond
who
intellectually
is
your
inferior
is
that
square
dealing
with
your
people
john
was
silent
but
red
of
countenance
warde
went
on
more
vehemently
i
know
all
about
your
system
of
work
i
have
a
harder
name
for
it
and
i
know
just
what
you
can
do
and
i
want
to
see
you
do
it
for
your
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
verney
and
for
the
hill
sake
i
pushed
you
on
at
cricket
a
bit
have
i
yes
you
owe
me
something
pay
up
by
entering
for
a
and
winning
it
a
yes
lord
charles
russell
shakespeare
medal
the
exam
is
next
october
i
coach
you
is
it
a
bargain
he
held
out
his
hand
staring
frankly
but
piercingly
into
john
eyes
all
right
sir
said
john
after
a
pause
i
try
and
buck
up
for
your
remove
john
smiled
feebly
and
sighed
footnotes
there
is
a
tablet
on
the
wall
of
the
old
schools
which
bears
the
following
inscription
near
this
spot
anthony
ashley
cooper
afterwards
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
while
yet
a
boy
in
harrow
school
saw
with
shame
and
indignation
the
pauper
funeral
which
helped
to
awaken
his
lifelong
devotion
to
the
service
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
chapter
ix
the
avon
bears
to
endless
years
a
magic
voice
along
where
shakespeare
strayed
in
stratford
shade
and
waked
the
world
to
song
we
heard
the
music
soft
and
wild
we
thrilled
to
pulses
new
the
winds
that
reared
the
avon
child
were
herga
nurses
too
that
evening
john
told
cæsar
what
warde
had
said
to
him
and
then
added
i
mean
to
have
a
shot
at
swan
of
avon
cæsar
looked
glum
but
how
about
the
remove
we
agreed
to
stay
in
the
second
fifth
till
christmas
it
the
jolliest
form
in
the
school
if
we
put
our
backs
and
heads
into
trials
we
can
easily
get
a
remove
blow
trials
john
turned
aside
look
here
jonathan
said
cæsar
eagerly
to
please
me
give
up
your
swatting
scheme
we
ca
spoil
the
end
of
this
jolly
term
he
caught
hold
of
john
arm
squeezing
it
affectionately
never
had
our
hero
been
so
sorely
tempted
we
must
stick
together
you
and
i
entreated
desmond
no
said
john
as
you
please
cæsar
replied
coldly
a
detestable
week
followed
john
tackled
his
shakespeare
alone
working
doggedly
then
quite
suddenly
the
giant
gripped
him
he
had
always
possessed
a
remarkable
memory
and
as
a
child
he
had
learnt
by
heart
many
passages
out
of
the
plays
a
fact
well
known
to
the
crafty
warde
but
these
he
had
swallowed
without
digesting
them
now
he
became
keen
the
keener
because
he
met
with
violent
opposition
from
the
caterpillar
and
the
duffer
who
were
of
opinion
that
shakespeare
was
a
back
number
john
won
the
prize
and
on
the
following
speech
day
saw
his
face
radiant
with
pride
and
happiness
as
he
received
the
medal
from
the
head
master
hands
you
look
as
pleased
as
if
i
got
my
flannels
said
john
surely
this
medal
is
a
greater
thing
oh
mum
you
do
know
much
about
boys
perhaps
not
but
her
eyes
twinkled
i
know
something
about
shakespeare
and
he
a
friend
that
will
stand
by
you
when
cricketing
days
are
over
if
you
pleased
so
am
i
said
john
scaife
got
his
flannels
and
at
lord
his
fielding
was
mentioned
as
the
finest
ever
seen
in
a
public
school
match
john
witnessed
the
game
from
the
top
of
the
trent
coach
and
he
stopped
at
trent
house
but
he
enjoy
his
exeat
because
he
knew
that
cæsar
was
in
trouble
cæsar
owed
scaife
thirteen
pounds
and
the
fact
that
this
debt
could
not
be
paid
without
confession
to
his
father
was
driving
him
distracted
scaife
it
is
true
laughed
genially
at
cæsar
distress
settle
when
you
please
he
said
but
for
heaven
sake
do
peach
to
your
governor
mine
would
laugh
and
pay
up
yours
will
pay
up
and
make
you
swear
not
to
touch
another
card
while
you
at
harrow
just
what
he
do
cæsar
told
john
and
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
john
said
bluntly
if
you
cut
loose
now
it
will
be
much
worse
next
term
rot
desmond
had
replied
i
paying
the
usual
bill
for
learning
a
difficult
game
that
how
the
demon
puts
it
but
i
a
turn
for
bridge
and
now
i
can
hold
my
own
i
better
than
and
quite
as
good
as
lovell
the
demon
of
course
is
in
another
class
and
therefore
he
ought
to
play
with
you
it
robbery
now
you
talking
bosh
the
eton
and
harrow
match
ended
in
another
draw
time
and
fielding
saved
harrow
from
defeat
the
fact
of
a
draw
had
significance
a
draw
spelled
compromise
john
had
indulged
in
a
superstitious
fancy
common
enough
to
persons
older
than
he
if
harrow
wins
he
put
it
to
himself
cæsar
will
triumph
if
eton
wins
cæsar
will
lose
when
the
match
proved
a
draw
john
drew
the
conclusion
that
his
pal
would
funk
telling
the
truth
an
apprehension
presently
confirmed
i
did
tell
the
governor
said
cæsar
when
john
and
he
met
my
eldest
brother
hugo
is
coming
home
and
i
shall
screw
it
out
of
him
he
a
good
sort
and
he
going
to
marry
a
girl
who
is
simply
rolling
he
fork
out
i
know
he
will
i
feel
awfully
cheery
i
do
said
john
he
had
good
reason
to
fear
that
cæsar
and
he
were
drifting
apart
now
he
worked
by
himself
and
his
voice
had
broken
a
small
thing
this
but
john
was
sensible
that
his
singing
voice
touched
corners
in
cæsar
soul
to
which
his
speaking
voice
never
penetrated
more
cæsar
and
he
had
agreed
to
differ
upon
points
of
conscience
other
than
and
every
point
of
conscientious
difference
increases
the
distance
between
true
friends
in
geometrical
progression
poor
jonathan
but
we
have
his
grateful
testimony
that
warde
stood
by
him
and
warde
made
him
see
life
at
harrow
and
beyond
in
a
new
light
warde
indeed
decomposed
the
light
into
primary
colours
a
sort
of
experiment
in
moral
chemistry
and
not
without
fascination
for
an
intelligent
boy
sometimes
it
became
difficult
to
follow
warde
members
of
the
alpine
club
said
that
often
it
was
impossible
because
he
jumped
where
others
crawled
and
he
clipped
words
phrases
thoughts
so
uncommonly
short
you
beginning
to
see
verney
eh
scales
crumbling
away
my
boy
and
strong
sunshine
hurts
the
eyes
at
first
black
spots
are
dancing
before
you
i
know
the
little
devils
or
again
this
remove
will
wipe
a
bit
more
off
the
debt
wo
it
ha
ha
made
you
reckon
up
what
you
owe
verney
but
there
are
others
i
awfully
grateful
to
you
sir
never
mind
me
what
do
you
mean
sir
new
testament
matthew
chapter
i
forget
verse
look
it
up
christ
answers
your
question
make
life
easier
and
happier
for
some
of
the
new
boys
pass
on
gratitude
set
it
see
john
had
appetite
for
such
talk
but
warde
never
gave
much
of
it
half
a
dozen
sentences
a
smile
a
nod
of
the
head
a
keen
look
and
a
striding
off
elsewhere
but
when
john
repeated
what
warde
had
said
to
cæsar
that
young
gentleman
looked
uneasy
warde
means
well
he
said
and
he
doing
wonders
with
the
manor
but
i
hope
he
not
going
to
make
a
sort
of
tin
parson
of
you
as
if
he
could
said
john
you
miles
ahead
of
me
jonathan
no
no
i
say
yes
cæsar
said
john
in
desperation
perhaps
we
sliding
apart
but
it
is
my
fault
indeed
it
is
and
think
what
it
means
to
me
you
heaps
of
friends
and
i
never
was
first
i
know
that
you
can
do
without
me
but
i
ca
do
without
you
dear
old
jonathan
cæsar
held
out
his
hand
smiling
i
a
jealous
ass
cæsar
and
as
for
calling
me
a
parson
he
laughed
scornfully
why
i
sooner
walk
with
you
even
if
you
were
the
worst
sinner
in
the
world
than
with
any
saint
that
ever
lived
the
feeling
in
john
voice
drove
cæsar
gay
smile
from
his
face
did
he
realize
possibly
for
the
first
time
that
if
john
and
he
remained
friends
he
might
drag
john
down
suddenly
his
face
brightened
jonathan
he
said
gravely
to
please
you
i
not
touch
a
card
again
this
term
and
we
have
such
good
times
these
last
three
weeks
that
you
forget
the
rest
of
it
and
what
delights
can
equal
those
that
stir
the
spirit
inner
deeps
when
one
that
loves
but
knows
not
reaps
a
truth
from
one
that
loves
and
knows
the
manor
played
in
the
match
at
cricket
being
but
barely
beaten
by
damer
everybody
admitted
that
this
glorious
state
of
affairs
was
due
to
warde
coaching
of
the
weaker
members
of
the
eleven
scaife
fielded
brilliantly
and
john
watching
him
said
to
himself
that
at
such
times
the
demon
was
irresistible
warde
invited
the
eleven
to
dinner
and
spoke
of
nothing
but
football
much
to
every
amusement
he
right
said
the
caterpillar
we
not
at
cricket
this
year
but
we
may
be
at
footer
john
spent
his
holidays
abroad
with
his
mother
and
when
the
school
reassembled
he
found
himself
in
the
first
fifth
with
satisfaction
he
reflected
that
this
was
lovell
last
term
and
too
warde
said
a
few
words
at
first
we
are
going
to
be
at
footer
i
hope
he
began
and
next
term
scaife
will
show
the
school
what
he
can
do
at
racquets
but
i
want
more
i
a
glutton
how
about
work
eh
lot
o
slacking
last
term
is
it
honest
you
fellows
cost
your
people
a
deal
of
money
and
it
well
spent
if
you
tackle
everything
in
school
life
as
you
tackled
damer
last
july
that
all
he
giving
you
what
he
gave
me
said
john
good
fellow
warde
observed
the
caterpillar
in
his
room
every
night
after
prayers
to
mug
up
his
form
work
what
murmurs
of
incredulity
fact
my
word
and
he
never
refuses
a
to
a
fellow
who
wants
it
he
paid
for
it
sneered
scaife
the
other
boys
nodded
enthusiasm
was
chilled
yes
of
course
warde
was
paid
for
it
john
caught
scaife
eye
you
do
believe
that
he
in
love
with
his
job
as
he
told
us
skittles
that
john
looked
solemn
he
had
a
bomb
to
throw
skittles
is
it
he
echoed
the
other
boys
turned
to
listen
do
you
think
he
take
a
better
paid
billet
scaife
laughed
derisively
of
course
he
would
like
a
shot
but
not
likely
to
get
the
chance
he
has
just
been
offered
the
head
mastership
of
wellborough
it
worth
about
four
thousand
a
year
pooh
who
told
you
that
cæsar
father
it
true
said
cæsar
and
he
refused
it
said
john
triumphantly
then
he
a
fool
said
scaife
angrily
he
marched
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
but
the
manor
as
a
corporate
body
when
it
heard
of
warde
refusal
to
accept
promotion
was
profoundly
impressed
thus
the
term
began
with
good
resolutions
upon
the
part
of
the
better
sort
very
soon
however
with
the
shortening
days
bridge
began
again
john
made
no
protest
afraid
of
losing
his
pal
he
called
himself
coward
and
considered
the
expediency
of
learning
bridge
so
as
to
be
in
the
same
boat
with
cæsar
cæsar
told
him
that
he
had
not
asked
his
brother
hugo
for
the
thirteen
pounds
hugo
it
seemed
had
come
back
from
teheran
with
a
decoration
and
the
air
of
an
ambassador
he
spoke
of
his
services
i
knew
that
hugo
would
make
me
swear
not
to
play
again
said
cæsar
to
john
and
naturally
i
want
to
get
some
of
the
plunder
back
i
am
getting
it
back
i
raked
thirty
bob
out
of
last
night
john
said
nothing
presently
it
came
to
his
ears
that
cæsar
was
getting
more
plunder
back
the
caterpillar
an
agreeable
gossip
because
he
condemned
nothing
except
dirt
and
low
breeding
told
john
that
was
losing
many
shekels
and
about
the
middle
of
october
cæsar
said
to
john
what
do
you
think
old
jonathan
i
jolly
nearly
paid
off
the
demon
and
you
wanted
me
to
chuck
the
thing
nice
sort
of
counsellor
must
have
lost
a
pot
you
bet
said
cæsar
but
that
does
keep
me
awake
at
night
he
has
got
the
seamless
whaleskin
behind
him
next
time
john
met
he
eyed
him
sharply
the
big
fellow
was
pulpier
than
ever
his
complexion
the
colour
of
skilly
yes
he
looked
much
worried
perhaps
the
imperishable
boot
lasted
too
long
and
nowadays
so
many
fellows
wore
shoes
thus
john
to
himself
indeed
not
only
looked
worried
he
was
worried
hideously
worried
and
with
excellent
reason
he
had
an
absurdly
wickedly
large
allowance
but
not
more
than
a
sovereign
of
it
was
left
more
he
owed
scaife
twenty
pounds
and
lovell
another
ten
both
these
young
gentlemen
had
hinted
plainly
that
they
wanted
to
see
their
money
i
must
have
the
stuff
now
said
lovell
when
asked
for
time
i
going
to
shoot
a
lot
this
christmas
and
the
governor
makes
me
pay
for
my
cartridges
so
does
mine
said
scaife
grinning
he
was
quite
indifferent
to
the
money
but
he
liked
to
see
squirm
he
continued
suavely
you
ought
to
settle
before
you
leave
ai
your
people
in
rome
yes
and
you
going
to
join
why
hang
it
some
dago
may
stick
a
knife
into
you
and
where
should
we
be
then
hey
your
governor
settle
a
gambling
debt
would
he
this
was
too
true
scaife
grinned
diabolically
he
knew
that
father
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
with
the
recording
angel
originally
a
nonconformist
he
had
joined
the
church
of
england
after
he
had
made
his
fortune
cf
from
the
workshops
of
our
merchant
which
appeared
in
the
pages
of
prattle
then
the
famous
inventor
of
the
imperishable
boot
had
taken
to
endowing
churches
and
he
published
pamphlets
denouncing
drink
and
gambling
pamphlets
sent
to
his
son
at
harrow
who
with
an
eye
to
backsheesh
had
praised
his
sire
prose
somewhat
indiscreetly
you
shall
have
your
confounded
money
said
violently
thanks
said
scaife
sweetly
when
we
asked
you
to
join
us
slight
emphasis
on
the
us
we
knew
that
we
could
rely
on
you
to
settle
promptly
the
demon
grinned
for
the
third
time
knowing
that
he
had
touched
a
weak
spot
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
if
you
touched
the
big
fellow
at
all
a
young
man
of
spirit
would
have
told
his
creditors
to
go
to
jericho
might
have
said
you
have
skinned
me
a
bit
i
whine
about
that
i
mean
to
pay
up
but
you
have
to
wait
till
i
have
the
money
i
stoney
now
scaife
and
lovell
must
have
accepted
this
as
an
ultimatum
but
wretched
pride
interfered
he
had
posed
as
a
sort
of
golden
youth
to
confess
himself
pinchbeck
seemed
an
unspeakable
humiliation
men
have
been
known
to
take
to
drink
under
the
impending
sword
of
dishonour
swallowed
instead
large
quantities
of
food
at
the
creameries
and
then
wrote
to
his
father
saying
that
he
would
like
to
have
a
cheque
for
thirty
pounds
by
return
of
post
he
was
leaving
harrow
he
pointed
out
and
he
wished
to
give
his
friends
some
handsome
presents
young
desmond
for
instance
the
great
minister
son
had
been
kind
to
him
prided
himself
upon
this
touch
and
scaife
too
he
was
under
obligations
to
scaife
who
would
be
a
power
and
so
forth
to
confess
frankly
that
he
owed
thirty
pounds
gambled
away
at
cards
required
more
cheek
than
our
stout
youth
possessed
his
father
refused
to
play
bridge
on
principle
because
he
could
never
remember
how
many
trumps
were
out
the
father
answered
by
return
of
post
but
enclosed
no
cheque
he
pointed
out
to
his
dear
thomas
that
giving
handsome
presents
with
another
money
was
an
objectionable
habit
thomas
received
a
large
possibly
too
large
an
allowance
he
must
exercise
if
he
wished
to
make
presents
his
quarterly
allowance
would
be
paid
as
usual
next
christmas
and
not
a
minute
before
there
would
be
time
then
to
reconsider
the
propriety
of
giving
young
desmond
a
suitable
gift
common
sense
told
to
show
this
letter
to
scaife
and
lovell
but
he
saw
the
demon
derisive
grin
and
recoiled
from
it
at
this
moment
temptation
seized
him
relentlessly
never
resisted
temptation
for
fun
so
he
put
it
he
would
write
the
sort
of
letter
which
his
father
ought
to
have
written
and
which
would
have
put
him
at
his
ease
it
ran
thus
my
dear
thomas
no
doubt
you
will
want
to
give
some
leaving
presents
and
a
spread
or
two
i
should
like
my
son
to
do
the
thing
handsomely
you
know
better
than
i
how
much
this
will
cost
but
i
am
prepared
to
send
you
say
or
thirty
pounds
for
such
a
purpose
or
you
can
have
the
bills
sent
to
me
with
love
your
affectionate
father
george
like
the
immortal
toots
rather
fancied
himself
as
a
the
longer
he
looked
at
his
effusion
the
more
he
liked
it
his
handwriting
was
not
unlike
his
father
modelled
indeed
upon
it
with
a
little
careful
manipulation
of
a
few
letters
the
day
was
cold
but
suddenly
found
himself
in
a
perspiration
none
the
less
it
seemed
easier
to
forge
a
letter
than
to
avow
himself
penniless
detection
impossible
two
or
three
tradesmen
in
harrow
would
advance
the
money
if
he
showed
them
this
letter
next
christmas
they
would
be
paid
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
made
up
his
mind
to
cross
the
rubicon
and
crossed
it
with
undue
haste
he
forged
the
letter
placed
it
in
an
envelope
which
had
come
from
rome
and
went
to
his
tailor
under
pretext
of
looking
at
patterns
he
led
the
man
aside
you
can
do
me
a
favour
he
began
in
his
usual
heavy
hesitating
manner
with
pleasure
said
the
tradesman
smiling
then
seeing
an
opportunity
he
added
you
are
leaving
harrow
but
i
trust
sir
you
will
not
take
your
custom
with
you
we
have
always
tried
to
please
you
in
his
turn
saw
opportunity
yes
yes
he
answered
then
he
produced
the
letter
envelope
and
all
i
have
here
a
letter
from
my
father
who
is
in
rome
i
read
it
to
you
no
you
can
read
it
yourself
the
tailor
read
the
letter
very
handsome
he
replied
handsome
indeed
sir
your
father
is
a
true
gentleman
it
happens
said
more
easily
for
the
thing
seemed
to
be
simpler
than
he
had
anticipated
it
happens
that
i
want
to
make
some
presents
but
i
not
going
to
buy
them
here
i
shall
send
to
the
stores
you
know
i
have
their
catalogue
just
so
sir
excellent
place
the
stores
for
nearly
everything
except
perhaps
my
line
i
should
not
think
of
buying
clothes
there
but
at
the
stores
one
must
pay
cash
i
not
got
the
cash
and
my
father
is
in
rome
i
should
like
to
have
the
money
if
possible
will
you
oblige
me
the
tradesman
hesitated
in
the
past
there
have
been
grave
scandals
connected
with
lending
money
to
boys
and
harrow
tradesmen
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
head
master
if
a
be
put
out
of
bounds
he
can
put
up
his
shutters
at
once
still
i
let
you
have
the
money
said
the
man
eyeing
keenly
thanks
the
tailor
observed
a
slight
flush
and
a
sudden
intake
of
breath
signs
which
stirred
suspicion
will
you
take
it
in
notes
sir
here
made
his
first
blunder
he
had
an
idea
that
paper
was
dangerous
stuff
in
gold
please
he
forgot
that
gold
is
not
easily
sent
in
a
letter
the
tailor
hesitated
but
he
had
gone
too
far
to
back
out
very
well
sir
i
have
not
pounds
thirty
if
you
please
i
shall
want
thirty
i
have
not
quite
that
amount
here
but
i
can
get
it
when
the
man
came
back
with
a
small
canvas
bag
in
his
hand
had
pocketed
the
letter
he
received
the
money
counted
it
thanked
the
tailor
and
turned
to
go
if
you
please
sir
yes
i
should
like
to
keep
your
father
letter
sir
as
a
form
of
receipt
sir
when
you
settle
i
return
it
if
if
anything
should
happen
to
to
you
sir
where
would
i
be
temper
showed
itself
you
all
talk
as
if
i
was
on
my
he
said
the
tailor
stared
others
then
had
suggested
to
this
large
unwholesome
youth
the
possibility
of
premature
decease
not
at
all
sir
but
we
do
live
in
the
valley
of
shadders
my
as
fine
and
hearty
a
specimen
as
you
wish
to
see
sir
was
taken
only
last
month
at
breakfast
too
as
he
was
chipping
his
third
egg
said
loftily
blow
your
wife
and
his
third
egg
here
the
letter
he
flung
down
the
letter
and
marched
out
of
the
shop
the
tradesman
looked
at
him
shaking
his
head
he
never
come
back
he
muttered
i
know
his
sort
too
well
then
business
happening
to
be
slack
he
the
letter
before
putting
it
away
then
he
whistled
softly
and
read
it
for
the
third
time
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
the
in
the
signature
and
on
the
envelope
did
not
look
to
be
written
by
the
same
hand
there
something
fishy
here
muttered
the
tradesman
i
must
show
this
to
amelia
it
was
his
habit
to
consult
his
wife
in
emergencies
the
chief
cutter
and
two
assistants
said
that
amelia
was
the
power
behind
the
throne
amelia
read
the
letter
listened
to
what
her
husband
had
to
say
stared
hard
at
the
envelope
and
delivered
herself
the
hand
that
wrote
the
envelope
never
wrote
the
letter
plain
to
me
now
william
you
got
me
and
the
children
to
think
of
this
may
mean
the
loss
of
our
business
and
worse
too
you
put
on
your
hat
and
go
straight
to
the
manor
warde
a
gentleman
and
i
think
he
let
me
and
the
children
suffer
for
your
foolishness
you
wait
another
minute
nor
did
he
after
prayers
that
night
warde
asked
to
come
to
his
study
obeyed
smiling
blandly
within
three
weeks
he
was
leaving
doubtless
warde
wanted
to
say
something
civil
the
big
fellow
was
feeling
quite
himself
he
had
paid
scaife
and
lovell
not
without
a
little
pardonable
braggadocio
you
fellows
have
put
me
to
some
inconvenience
he
said
i
make
it
a
rule
not
to
run
things
fine
but
after
all
thirty
quid
is
no
great
sum
here
you
are
we
do
want
to
drive
you
into
the
workhouse
said
scaife
thanks
give
you
your
revenge
any
time
i
dare
say
between
now
and
the
end
of
the
term
you
have
most
of
it
back
warde
asked
to
sit
down
in
a
particular
chair
which
faced
the
light
from
a
large
lamp
then
he
took
up
an
envelope
suddenly
cold
chills
trickled
down
spine
he
recognized
the
envelope
that
scoundrel
had
betrayed
him
not
for
a
moment
however
did
he
suppose
that
the
forgery
had
been
detected
on
the
strength
of
this
letter
said
warde
gravely
you
borrowed
thirty
pounds
from
a
tradesman
denial
being
fatuous
said
yes
sir
you
know
i
suppose
that
harrow
tradesmen
are
expressly
forbidden
to
lend
boys
money
i
am
hardly
a
boy
sir
and
er
under
the
circumstances
warde
smiled
very
grimly
ah
under
the
circumstances
have
you
any
objection
to
telling
me
the
exact
circumstances
not
at
all
sir
i
wished
to
make
some
presents
to
my
friends
i
am
going
to
give
a
large
oh
still
thirty
pounds
is
a
large
sum
not
to
my
father
sir
i
er
thought
of
coming
to
you
sir
with
that
letter
did
you
warde
took
the
letter
from
the
envelope
and
glanced
at
it
with
faint
interest
so
thought
then
he
picked
up
a
magnifying
glass
and
played
with
it
it
was
a
trick
of
his
to
pick
up
objects
on
his
desk
and
turn
them
in
his
thin
nervous
fingers
was
not
seriously
alarmed
he
had
great
faith
in
a
weapon
which
had
served
him
faithfully
his
lying
tongue
yes
sir
i
thought
you
would
be
willing
to
advance
the
money
for
a
few
days
and
then
and
then
and
then
i
thought
i
would
bother
you
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
getting
a
tradesman
into
trouble
i
hope
you
wo
be
hard
on
him
sir
i
shall
not
be
hard
on
him
said
warde
because
for
a
moment
his
eyes
flashed
because
he
came
to
me
and
confessed
his
fault
but
i
wo
deny
that
i
gave
him
a
very
uncomfortable
quarter
of
an
hour
he
sat
in
your
chair
shuffled
uneasily
have
you
this
thirty
pounds
in
your
pocket
asked
warde
casually
began
to
regret
his
haste
in
settling
no
sir
some
of
it
none
of
it
you
sent
it
to
london
to
buy
these
handsome
presents
sir
you
had
much
time
early
and
you
received
the
money
in
gold
did
you
buy
orders
head
began
to
buzz
he
found
himself
wondering
why
warde
was
speaking
in
this
smooth
quiet
voice
so
different
from
his
usual
curt
incisive
tones
yes
sir
at
the
harrow
yes
sir
ah
again
the
picked
up
the
letter
but
this
time
he
did
lay
down
the
lens
instead
he
used
it
very
deliberately
shivered
with
difficulty
he
clenched
his
teeth
so
as
to
prevent
them
clicking
like
castanets
then
warde
held
up
the
sheet
of
paper
to
the
light
of
the
lamp
obviously
he
wished
to
examine
the
watermark
the
paper
was
thin
notepaper
the
kind
that
is
sold
everywhere
for
foreign
correspondence
economical
in
such
matters
had
bought
a
couple
of
quires
when
his
people
went
abroad
the
paper
he
had
bought
did
not
quite
match
the
roman
envelope
warde
opened
a
drawer
from
which
he
took
some
thin
paper
this
also
he
held
up
to
the
light
it
an
odd
coincidence
he
said
tranquilly
your
father
in
rome
uses
the
same
notepaper
that
i
buy
here
but
the
envelope
is
italian
he
spoke
interrogatively
but
the
wretch
opposite
had
lost
the
power
of
speech
he
collapsed
warde
rose
throwing
aside
his
quiet
manner
as
if
it
were
a
cloak
now
he
was
himself
alert
on
edge
sanguine
you
fool
he
exclaimed
you
clumsy
fool
why
a
child
could
find
you
out
and
you
you
have
dared
to
play
with
such
an
edged
tool
as
forgery
now
do
the
one
thing
which
is
left
to
you
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
me
at
once
in
imposing
this
command
a
command
which
he
knew
would
be
obeyed
inasmuch
as
he
perceived
that
he
dominated
the
weak
grovelling
creature
in
front
of
him
warde
overlooked
the
possibility
that
this
boy
confession
might
implicate
other
boys
already
he
had
formed
in
his
mind
a
working
hypothesis
to
account
for
this
forged
letter
the
fellow
no
doubt
was
in
debt
to
some
harrow
townsman
for
whom
did
you
this
money
to
whom
did
you
pay
it
answer
and
he
was
answered
i
owed
the
money
to
scaife
and
lovell
then
he
told
the
story
of
the
at
the
last
word
he
fell
on
his
knees
blubbering
get
up
said
warde
sharply
pull
yourself
together
if
you
can
the
master
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
at
seeing
his
utter
collapse
he
rang
the
bell
answered
by
the
dumbleton
dumbleton
take
to
the
there
is
no
one
in
it
i
believe
no
sir
you
will
fetch
what
he
may
require
for
the
night
quietly
you
understand
very
good
sir
follow
dumbleton
warde
addressed
you
will
consider
yourself
under
arrest
your
meals
will
be
brought
to
you
you
will
hold
no
communication
with
anybody
except
dumbleton
and
me
you
will
send
no
messages
you
will
write
no
notes
do
you
hear
yes
sir
then
go
dumbleton
opened
the
door
young
man
and
servant
passed
out
and
into
the
passage
beyond
warde
waited
one
moment
then
he
followed
them
into
the
passage
but
instead
of
going
upstairs
he
paused
for
an
instant
with
his
fingers
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
which
led
from
the
private
side
to
the
boys
quarters
he
sighed
as
he
passed
through
at
this
moment
lovell
was
sitting
in
his
room
alone
with
scaife
they
had
no
suspicion
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
study
in
the
afternoon
there
had
been
a
match
with
an
old
harrovian
team
and
both
scaife
and
lovell
had
played
for
the
school
but
as
yet
neither
had
got
his
flannels
as
warde
passed
through
the
private
side
door
scaife
was
saying
angrily
i
believe
challoner
challoner
was
captain
of
the
football
eleven
and
a
monitor
has
a
grudge
against
us
if
we
had
a
chance
and
we
had
of
getting
our
flannels
last
year
why
is
it
a
cert
this
eh
lovell
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
a
he
answered
and
you
right
challoner
does
like
us
and
it
amuses
him
to
keep
us
out
of
our
just
rights
the
monitors
know
i
detest
and
they
do
think
you
called
the
demon
for
nothing
challoner
is
more
of
a
monitor
than
a
how
about
a
rubber
there
just
time
i
do
mind
lovell
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
familiar
cry
that
imperious
call
which
makes
an
harrovian
feel
himself
master
of
more
or
less
willing
slaves
echoed
through
the
house
immediately
the
came
running
it
was
not
considered
healthy
to
keep
lovell
waiting
ask
to
come
up
here
and
he
paused
warde
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
was
approaching
lovell
hesitated
then
he
repeated
what
he
had
just
said
with
a
slight
variation
for
benefit
tell
him
i
want
to
ask
him
a
question
about
the
right
said
the
fag
bustling
off
lovell
waited
to
receive
his
he
had
very
good
manners
can
i
do
anything
for
you
sir
he
asked
yes
said
warde
deliberately
he
entered
lovell
room
and
looked
at
scaife
who
rose
at
once
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
alone
lovell
certainly
sir
wo
you
sit
down
warde
waited
till
scaife
had
closed
the
door
then
he
said
quietly
lovell
does
owe
you
money
footnotes
the
form
of
harrow
the
terminal
examination
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
chapter
x
ferdinand
mendez
pinto
was
but
a
type
of
thee
thou
liar
of
the
first
magnitude
lovell
betrayed
his
astonishment
by
a
slight
start
however
he
faced
warde
with
a
smile
warde
alert
with
youthful
figure
looked
but
little
older
than
his
pupil
for
a
moment
the
two
stared
steadily
at
each
other
then
very
politely
lovell
said
no
sir
he
does
not
warde
continued
curtly
then
he
has
paid
you
what
he
did
owe
you
lovell
nodded
shrugging
his
shoulders
plainly
warde
had
discovered
the
fact
of
the
debt
probably
that
fool
had
applied
to
his
father
and
the
father
had
written
to
warde
it
was
unthinkable
that
warde
knew
more
than
this
having
reached
this
conclusion
lovell
turned
over
in
his
mind
two
or
three
specious
lies
that
might
meet
the
exigency
yes
he
replied
with
apparent
frankness
did
owe
me
money
and
he
has
paid
me
after
a
slight
pause
warde
said
quietly
it
is
my
duty
as
your
tutor
to
ask
you
how
became
indebted
to
you
i
lent
him
the
money
said
lovell
ah
please
call
lovell
went
into
the
passage
had
he
an
intuition
that
he
was
about
to
call
boy
for
the
last
time
or
did
the
excitement
find
an
outlet
in
sound
he
had
never
called
boy
so
loudly
or
clearly
the
scurried
up
again
tell
him
to
send
scaife
here
said
warde
lovell
florid
face
paled
scaife
would
introduce
complications
and
yet
if
it
had
come
to
warde
ears
that
was
in
debt
to
two
of
his
schoolfellows
and
if
he
had
found
out
the
name
of
one
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
knew
the
name
of
the
other
also
as
he
gave
the
fag
the
message
he
regretted
that
scaife
and
he
could
not
have
a
minute
private
conversation
together
you
lent
ten
pounds
lovell
yes
sir
scaife
came
in
cool
handsomer
than
usual
because
of
the
sparkle
in
his
eyes
shut
the
door
scaife
look
at
me
please
owed
you
money
scaife
glanced
at
lovell
whose
left
eyelid
quivered
kindly
stand
behind
scaife
lovell
thank
you
answer
my
question
scaife
yes
sir
he
owed
me
money
have
lent
him
money
too
said
lovell
it
was
admirably
done
the
hint
cleverly
conveyed
the
mild
amazement
warde
smiled
grimly
scaife
understood
and
took
his
cue
yes
i
have
lent
him
money
said
he
after
a
slight
pause
twenty
pounds
i
believe
sir
that
is
the
amount
and
can
you
offer
me
any
explanation
why
whose
father
to
my
knowledge
has
always
given
him
a
very
large
allowance
should
borrow
thirty
pounds
of
you
two
i
have
the
smallest
idea
have
you
lovell
no
said
lovell
unless
his
younger
brother
who
is
at
eton
has
got
into
trouble
he
very
fond
of
his
brothers
um
you
speak
up
for
your
friend
lovell
frowned
a
friend
sir
no
of
course
said
warde
reflectively
if
it
is
true
that
borrowed
this
money
to
help
a
brother
he
paused
staring
at
lovell
from
the
bottom
of
a
big
heart
he
was
praying
that
lovell
would
not
lie
certainly
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
affair
was
pressing
having
the
money
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
but
you
pressed
for
repayment
said
warde
sharply
that
is
true
sir
i
on
an
allowance
and
i
shall
have
many
expenses
this
holidays
you
scaife
asked
for
your
money
yes
sir
well
between
you
you
have
driven
this
unhappy
wretch
into
crime
crime
sir
at
last
their
abandoned
them
crime
is
a
word
which
looms
large
in
the
imaginations
of
youth
what
had
done
what
crime
sir
scaife
the
more
although
fully
two
years
the
younger
asked
the
question
forgery
forgery
lovell
repeated
he
was
plainly
shocked
the
idiot
exclaimed
scaife
yes
forgery
have
you
anything
to
say
it
is
a
time
when
the
truth
all
the
truth
might
be
accepted
as
an
extenuating
circumstance
i
speak
to
you
first
lovell
you
a
sixth
form
boy
remember
i
have
been
one
myself
and
it
is
your
duty
to
help
me
i
beg
pardon
sir
lovell
replied
i
have
never
considered
it
my
duty
as
a
sixth
form
boy
to
play
the
usher
nor
did
i
but
you
ought
to
work
on
parallel
lines
with
us
you
accepted
the
privileges
of
the
sixth
lovell
flush
deepened
more
continued
warde
you
know
that
we
the
masters
have
implicit
trust
in
the
sixth
form
a
trust
but
seldom
betrayed
for
instance
i
should
not
think
of
entering
your
room
without
tapping
on
the
door
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
accept
your
bare
word
unhesitatingly
i
say
emphatically
that
if
you
knowing
these
things
have
accepted
the
privileges
of
your
order
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
ignoring
its
duties
you
have
not
acted
like
a
man
of
honour
sir
do
bluff
now
for
the
last
time
will
you
give
me
what
i
have
given
you
trust
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
lovell
answered
stiffly
and
you
scaife
i
am
sorry
sir
that
has
been
such
a
fool
we
lent
him
this
money
because
he
wanted
it
badly
and
he
said
he
would
pay
us
back
before
the
end
of
the
term
you
stick
to
that
story
why
yes
sir
why
should
we
tell
you
a
lie
ah
why
indeed
sighed
warde
then
his
voice
grew
hard
and
sharp
the
persuasiveness
the
sentences
gave
place
to
his
curtest
manner
this
matter
said
he
is
out
of
my
hands
the
head
master
will
deal
with
it
i
must
ask
you
for
your
keys
lovell
and
if
i
refuse
to
give
them
up
then
we
must
break
into
your
boxes
thanks
he
took
the
keys
follow
me
please
the
pair
followed
him
into
the
private
side
upstairs
and
into
the
there
were
three
beds
in
it
upon
one
sat
his
complexion
turned
a
sickly
drab
when
he
saw
lovell
and
scaife
he
even
glanced
at
the
window
with
a
hunted
expression
the
window
was
three
stories
from
the
ground
and
heavily
barred
ever
since
a
boy
in
delirium
had
tried
to
jump
from
it
your
will
be
brought
to
you
said
warde
he
went
out
slowly
the
boys
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
massive
lock
they
were
prisoners
scaife
walked
up
to
you
told
warde
about
the
bridge
i
had
to
scaife
do
look
at
me
like
that
lovell
his
voice
broke
into
a
terrified
scream
do
let
him
hit
me
i
could
help
it
i
swear
i
you
cur
said
scaife
i
would
touch
you
with
a
pole
just
what
passed
between
warde
and
the
head
master
must
be
surmised
carefully
hidden
in
lovell
boxes
were
found
cards
and
markers
upon
the
latter
remained
the
results
of
the
last
game
played
and
under
the
winning
column
a
rough
calculation
in
pounds
shillings
and
pence
there
were
no
names
next
day
during
first
school
a
notice
came
round
to
each
form
to
be
in
the
at
not
a
boy
knew
or
guessed
the
reason
of
this
summons
the
manorites
aware
that
three
of
their
house
were
in
the
believed
that
an
infectious
disease
had
broken
out
only
desmond
john
and
the
caterpillar
experienced
fears
that
a
catastrophe
had
taken
place
when
the
school
assembled
at
eight
the
monitors
came
in
followed
by
the
head
master
in
cap
and
gown
then
a
moment
later
the
school
custos
entered
with
scaife
they
sat
down
upon
a
small
bench
near
the
door
immediately
the
whispers
the
shuffling
of
feet
the
occasional
cough
died
down
into
a
thrilling
silence
the
head
master
stood
up
he
was
a
man
of
singularly
impressive
face
and
figure
and
his
voice
had
what
may
be
described
as
an
edge
to
it
the
cutting
quality
so
invaluable
to
any
speaker
who
desires
to
make
a
deep
impression
upon
his
audience
he
began
his
address
in
the
clear
cold
accents
of
one
who
sets
forth
facts
which
can
neither
be
controverted
nor
ignored
slowly
inexorably
without
wasting
a
word
or
a
second
he
told
the
school
what
had
happened
then
he
paused
as
his
voice
melted
away
the
boys
moved
restlessly
upon
their
faces
shone
a
curious
excitement
and
relief
gambling
in
its
forms
is
too
deeply
rooted
in
human
hearts
to
awaken
any
great
antipathy
so
far
then
the
sympathy
of
the
audience
lay
with
the
culprits
this
the
head
master
knew
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
changed
subtly
but
unmistakably
you
were
afraid
he
said
that
i
had
something
worse
ah
yes
unspeakably
worse
to
tell
you
thank
god
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
from
which
every
clean
manly
boy
must
recoil
in
disgust
but
on
that
account
do
blind
yourselves
to
the
issues
involved
this
playing
of
bridge
a
game
you
have
seen
your
own
people
playing
night
after
night
perhaps
is
harmless
enough
in
itself
i
can
say
more
it
is
a
game
and
hence
its
fascination
which
calls
into
use
some
of
the
finest
qualities
of
the
brain
judgment
memory
the
faculty
of
making
correct
deductions
foresight
and
patience
it
teaches
restraint
it
makes
for
pleasant
fellowship
it
does
all
this
and
more
provided
that
it
never
degenerates
into
gambling
the
very
moment
that
the
game
becomes
a
gamble
if
any
one
of
the
players
is
likely
to
lose
a
sum
greater
than
he
can
reasonably
afford
to
pay
greater
than
he
would
cheerfully
spend
upon
any
other
form
of
entertainment
then
bridge
becomes
cursed
and
because
you
boys
have
not
the
experience
to
determine
the
difference
between
a
mere
game
and
a
gamble
is
forbidden
you
and
rightly
so
now
let
us
consider
what
has
happened
a
stupid
foolish
fellow
playing
with
boys
infinitely
cleverer
than
himself
has
lost
a
sum
of
money
which
he
could
not
pay
to
obtain
the
means
of
paying
it
he
deliberately
forged
a
letter
and
a
signature
and
then
followed
the
inevitable
lying
lie
upon
lie
that
is
always
the
price
of
lies
lie
on
still
i
would
mitigate
the
punishment
if
i
could
but
i
must
think
of
the
majority
this
sort
of
malignant
disease
must
be
cut
out
two
of
the
three
offenders
are
young
men
they
were
leaving
at
the
end
of
this
term
they
will
leave
instead
the
third
boy
is
much
younger
because
of
his
youth
i
have
been
persuaded
by
his
to
give
him
a
further
chance
again
he
paused
then
he
exclaimed
loudly
scaife
scaife
stood
up
very
pale
here
sir
scaife
you
will
go
into
the
fourth
form
room
and
prepare
to
receive
the
punishment
which
no
member
of
the
eleven
should
ever
deserve
john
sat
with
his
form
while
the
head
master
was
addressing
the
school
not
far
off
was
the
caterpillar
less
cool
than
usual
so
john
remarked
his
collar
for
instance
seemed
to
be
too
tight
and
he
moved
restlessly
upon
his
chair
many
very
brave
men
become
nervous
when
a
great
danger
has
passed
them
by
egerton
said
afterwards
i
felt
like
getting
down
a
hole
and
pulling
the
hole
after
me
not
my
own
some
yankee
you
know
still
he
displayed
remarkable
under
trying
circumstances
two
of
lovell
particular
friends
were
seen
to
turn
the
colour
of
cheddar
cheese
but
desmond
so
john
noticed
grew
red
rather
than
yellow
nor
did
he
tremble
but
his
fists
were
clenched
and
his
eyes
kindled
as
scaife
left
the
followed
by
titchener
the
provider
of
birches
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
that
boys
about
to
be
swished
are
properly
prepared
to
receive
punishment
the
boys
began
to
shuffle
in
their
places
but
the
head
master
held
up
his
hand
it
was
then
that
lovell
two
particular
friends
who
had
partially
recovered
felt
that
the
earth
was
once
more
slipping
from
under
them
it
takes
four
to
play
bridge
the
caterpillar
fingers
went
to
his
collar
again
in
this
case
there
must
have
been
a
fourth
possibly
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
not
more
i
think
because
the
secret
was
too
well
kept
we
are
confronted
with
the
disagreeable
fact
that
three
boys
are
going
to
receive
the
most
severe
punishments
i
can
inflict
and
that
another
escapes
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
the
head
master
waited
to
let
each
deliberate
word
soak
in
perhaps
he
had
calculated
the
effect
of
his
voice
upon
a
boy
of
sensibility
and
imagination
that
scaife
his
friend
should
suffer
the
indignity
of
a
swishing
and
that
he
should
escape
seemed
to
cæsar
desmond
not
a
bit
of
rare
good
fortune
as
it
appeared
to
the
others
but
an
incredible
miscarriage
of
justice
to
submit
tamely
to
such
a
burden
was
unthinkable
he
sprang
to
his
feet
ardent
impetuous
afire
with
the
spirit
which
makes
men
accept
death
rather
than
dishonour
and
then
in
a
voice
that
rang
through
the
room
thrilling
the
coldest
and
most
callous
heart
he
exclaimed
i
was
the
fourth
a
curious
sound
escaped
from
the
audience
a
gasp
of
surprise
of
admiration
and
of
dismay
at
least
so
the
head
master
interpreted
it
and
looking
at
the
faces
about
him
he
read
approval
or
disapproval
according
as
each
boy
betrayed
the
feeling
in
his
heart
you
desmond
yes
sir
the
caterpillar
rose
slowly
he
was
cool
enough
now
i
was
the
fifth
but
lovell
two
particular
friends
sat
tight
as
they
put
it
let
us
not
blame
them
you
egerton
yes
sir
for
a
moment
the
head
master
hesitated
into
his
mind
there
flashed
the
image
of
two
notable
figures
the
fathers
whom
he
had
entreated
to
send
sons
to
the
manor
if
if
by
so
doing
he
had
compassed
the
boys
ruin
could
he
ever
have
forgiven
himself
but
now
the
boys
themselves
had
justified
his
action
they
had
proved
worthy
of
their
breeding
and
the
traditions
of
the
hill
come
here
he
said
when
they
stood
opposite
to
him
he
continued
you
give
yourselves
up
to
receive
the
punishment
i
am
about
to
inflict
upon
scaife
the
boys
did
not
answer
save
with
their
eyes
the
silence
in
the
great
room
was
so
profound
that
john
made
sure
that
the
beating
of
his
heart
must
be
heard
by
everybody
i
shall
not
punish
you
this
voluntary
confession
has
done
much
to
redeem
your
fault
meet
me
in
my
study
at
nine
this
evening
and
i
will
talk
to
you
when
i
came
here
i
hardly
hoped
to
find
saints
but
i
did
expect
to
find
gentlemen
and
i
have
not
been
disappointed
he
addressed
the
others
you
will
return
to
your
and
quietly
if
you
please
the
immediate
and
most
noticeable
effect
of
lovell
expulsion
was
the
loss
of
the
next
house
match
damer
defeated
the
manor
easily
some
of
the
fags
whispered
to
each
other
that
the
injuries
inflicted
by
the
head
master
on
scaife
had
been
so
severe
as
to
incapacitate
the
of
the
house
two
boys
had
concealed
themselves
in
the
armoury
which
is
just
below
the
fourth
form
room
upon
the
morning
when
scaife
was
flogged
but
they
reported
nothing
however
severe
the
punishment
might
have
been
scaife
received
it
without
a
whimper
in
truth
scaife
received
but
one
cut
and
that
a
light
one
the
head
master
wished
to
lay
stripes
upon
the
boy
heart
not
his
body
when
he
saw
him
prepared
to
receive
punishment
he
said
gravely
i
have
never
flogged
a
member
of
the
eleven
and
now
at
the
last
moment
i
offer
you
the
choice
between
a
flogging
and
expulsion
i
prefer
to
be
flogged
then
one
but
scaife
never
forgot
the
walk
from
the
yard
to
the
manor
after
execution
he
was
too
proud
to
run
too
proud
not
to
face
the
boys
he
happened
to
meet
they
turned
aside
their
eyes
from
his
furious
glare
but
he
met
no
members
of
his
own
house
they
had
the
delicacy
to
leave
the
coast
clear
when
he
reached
his
room
he
found
desmond
alone
desmond
said
nervously
i
asked
warde
if
we
could
have
breakfast
here
this
morning
instead
of
going
into
hall
i
got
some
ripping
salmon
scaife
had
faced
everything
with
a
brazen
indifference
but
the
sympathy
in
his
friend
voice
overpowered
him
he
flung
himself
upon
the
sofa
by
the
window
and
wept
not
as
a
boy
weeps
but
with
the
cruel
grinding
sobs
of
a
man
he
wept
for
his
stained
pride
for
his
not
because
he
had
sinned
and
caused
others
to
sin
the
boy
watching
him
seeing
the
hero
hearing
his
heartbreaking
sobs
interpreted
very
differently
those
sounds
infinitely
distressed
turning
over
and
over
in
his
mind
some
soothing
phrases
some
word
of
comfort
and
encouragement
desmond
waited
till
the
first
paroxysm
had
passed
what
he
said
then
shall
not
be
set
down
in
cold
print
you
may
be
sure
he
proved
that
friendship
between
two
strong
vigorous
boys
is
no
frail
thread
but
a
golden
chain
which
adversity
strengthens
and
refines
scaife
rose
up
with
his
heart
softened
not
by
his
own
tears
but
by
the
tears
he
saw
in
desmond
eyes
i
all
right
now
he
said
then
with
frowning
brows
he
added
thoughtfully
i
deserve
what
i
got
for
being
a
fool
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
that
such
a
swine
as
would
be
sure
to
betray
us
sooner
or
later
i
shall
be
wiser
next
time
next
time
the
dismay
in
desmond
voice
made
scaife
smile
do
worry
cæsar
no
more
bridge
for
me
but
he
laughed
harshly
the
leopard
ca
change
his
spots
and
he
wo
give
up
hunting
because
he
has
fallen
into
a
trap
and
got
out
of
it
come
let
tackle
the
salmon
the
winter
term
came
to
an
end
and
the
school
broke
up
upon
the
evening
of
the
last
sunday
warde
said
a
few
words
to
john
i
propose
to
make
some
changes
in
the
house
he
said
abruptly
would
you
like
to
share
no
with
desmond
no
was
the
jolliest
at
the
manor
it
overlooked
the
gardens
and
was
larger
than
some
then
john
remembered
scaife
and
the
duffer
desmond
has
been
with
scaife
ever
since
he
came
to
the
house
sir
true
but
i
going
to
give
scaife
a
room
to
himself
he
entitled
to
it
as
the
future
captain
of
the
eleven
that
is
settled
you
and
duff
must
part
he
two
forms
below
you
in
the
school
and
never
likely
to
soar
much
higher
than
the
second
fifth
next
term
you
will
be
in
the
sixth
and
by
the
summer
i
hope
desmond
will
have
joined
you
you
will
find
together
of
course
scaife
can
find
with
you
if
you
wish
spoken
to
him
and
desmond
and
so
john
fondest
hope
was
realized
when
he
came
back
to
the
manor
desmond
and
he
spent
much
time
and
rather
more
money
than
they
could
afford
in
making
no
the
cosiest
room
in
the
house
consciences
were
salved
thus
john
bought
for
desmond
some
picture
or
other
decorative
object
which
cost
more
money
than
he
felt
justified
in
spending
on
himself
then
desmond
made
john
a
similar
present
it
was
whipping
the
devil
round
the
stump
john
said
but
oh
the
delight
of
giving
his
friend
something
he
coveted
and
receiving
presents
from
him
in
return
during
this
term
scaife
became
one
of
the
school
in
many
ways
he
was
admittedly
the
most
remarkable
boy
at
harrow
the
admirable
crichton
who
appears
now
and
again
in
every
decade
he
won
the
high
jump
and
the
these
triumphs
kept
him
out
of
mischief
and
occupied
every
minute
of
his
time
he
associated
with
the
bloods
and
one
day
desmond
told
john
that
he
considered
himself
to
have
been
dropped
by
this
tremendous
swell
john
discreetly
held
his
tongue
but
in
his
own
mind
as
before
he
was
convinced
that
scaife
and
desmond
would
come
together
again
the
inexorable
circumstance
of
superiority
at
games
had
separated
the
boys
but
only
for
a
brief
season
desmond
would
become
a
blood
soon
and
then
it
would
be
turn
to
be
dropped
being
a
philosopher
our
hero
did
not
worry
too
much
over
the
future
but
made
the
most
of
the
present
with
a
grateful
and
joyous
heart
in
his
humility
he
was
unable
to
measure
his
influence
on
desmond
in
athletic
pursuits
an
inferior
in
all
intellectual
attainments
he
was
pulling
far
ahead
of
his
friend
the
artful
warde
had
a
word
to
say
which
gave
john
food
for
thought
you
can
never
equal
your
friend
at
cricket
or
footer
verney
if
you
wish
to
score
it
is
time
to
play
your
own
game
shortly
after
this
john
realized
that
warde
had
read
cæsar
aright
charles
desmond
son
as
has
been
said
acclaimed
quality
wherever
he
met
it
john
intellectual
advance
amazed
and
then
fascinated
him
when
john
discovered
this
he
worked
harder
warde
smiled
john
ran
second
for
the
prize
poem
he
had
genuine
feeling
for
nature
but
he
lacked
as
yet
the
technical
ability
to
display
it
a
more
practised
versifier
won
the
prize
but
john
taste
for
history
and
literature
secured
him
the
bourchier
not
without
a
struggle
which
whetted
to
keenness
every
faculty
he
possessed
more
to
his
delight
he
realized
that
his
enthusiasm
was
contagious
cæsar
entered
eagerly
into
his
competitions
struggle
and
strife
appealed
to
the
irishman
he
talked
over
john
themes
read
his
verses
and
predicted
triumphs
warde
told
john
that
cæsar
desmond
might
have
stuck
in
the
first
fifth
had
it
not
been
for
this
quickening
of
the
clay
the
days
succeeded
each
other
swiftly
and
smoothly
warde
was
seen
to
smile
more
than
ever
during
this
term
certain
big
fellows
who
opposed
him
were
leaving
or
had
already
left
bohun
now
head
of
the
house
was
a
sturdy
straightforward
monitor
not
a
famous
athlete
but
able
to
hold
his
own
in
any
field
of
endeavour
just
before
the
christmas
holidays
warde
discovered
to
his
horror
that
the
drainage
at
the
manor
was
out
of
order
at
great
expense
a
new
and
perfect
system
was
laid
down
at
last
warde
told
himself
his
house
might
be
pronounced
sanitary
within
and
without
when
the
summer
term
came
desmond
joined
john
in
the
sixth
form
they
were
entitled
to
single
rooms
but
they
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
remain
in
no
desmond
was
invested
with
the
right
to
fag
and
the
right
to
find
how
blessed
a
privilege
the
right
to
find
is
boys
who
have
enjoyed
it
will
attest
the
cosy
meals
in
one
own
room
the
pleasant
talk
the
sense
of
intimacy
the
freedom
from
restraint
custom
stales
all
good
things
but
how
delicious
they
taste
at
first
the
privilege
of
fagging
is
not
however
unadulterated
bliss
when
warde
said
to
cæsar
well
desmond
how
do
you
like
ordering
about
your
slave
desmond
replied
ruefully
well
sir
little
duff
has
broken
my
inkstand
spilt
the
ink
on
our
new
carpet
and
let
verney
bullfinch
escape
i
think
on
the
whole
i
as
lief
wait
on
myself
early
in
june
it
became
plain
that
unless
the
unforeseen
occurred
harrow
would
have
a
strong
eleven
and
that
desmond
would
be
a
member
of
it
john
and
fluff
were
playing
in
the
sixth
form
game
but
john
had
no
chance
of
his
flannels
although
he
had
improved
in
batting
and
bowling
thanks
to
warde
indefatigable
coaching
scaife
hardly
ever
spoke
to
john
now
but
occasionally
he
came
into
no
to
talk
to
desmond
upon
these
rare
occasions
john
would
generally
find
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
room
always
when
he
returned
desmond
seemed
to
be
restless
and
perplexed
his
admiration
for
scaife
had
waxed
rather
than
waned
indeed
john
himself
detesting
scaife
for
it
had
come
to
that
fearing
him
on
desmond
account
admired
him
notwithstanding
captivated
by
his
amazing
grace
good
looks
and
audacity
his
recklessness
held
even
the
bloods
spellbound
a
coach
ran
through
harrow
in
the
afternoons
of
that
season
scaife
made
a
bet
that
he
would
drive
this
coach
from
one
end
of
the
high
street
to
the
other
under
the
very
nose
of
authority
the
rules
of
the
school
set
forth
rigorously
that
no
boy
is
to
drive
in
or
on
any
vehicle
whatever
only
the
cycle
corps
are
allowed
to
use
bicycles
scaife
bet
you
may
be
sure
excited
extraordinary
interest
he
won
it
easily
disguised
as
the
coachman
a
clever
enough
to
deceive
even
those
who
were
in
the
secret
his
friends
knew
that
he
kept
two
at
wembley
one
afternoon
he
dared
to
play
in
a
match
against
the
nondescripts
warde
daughter
just
out
of
the
schoolroom
happened
to
be
present
and
she
rubbed
her
lovely
eyes
when
she
saw
scaife
careering
over
the
field
scaife
laughed
when
he
saw
her
but
before
she
left
the
ground
a
note
had
reached
her
dear
miss
warde
i
am
sure
that
you
have
too
much
sporting
blood
in
your
veins
to
tell
your
father
that
you
have
seen
me
playing
polo
yours
very
sincerely
reginald
scaife
to
run
such
risks
seemed
to
john
madness
to
desmond
it
indicated
genius
there
never
was
such
a
fellow
said
cæsar
to
john
when
cæsar
spoke
in
that
tone
john
knew
that
scaife
had
but
to
hold
up
a
finger
and
that
cæsar
would
come
to
him
even
as
a
bird
drops
into
the
jaws
of
a
snake
cæsar
was
strong
but
the
demon
was
stronger
after
the
zingari
match
desmond
got
his
flannels
he
was
cheered
at
six
bill
everybody
liked
him
everybody
was
proud
of
him
proud
of
his
father
proud
of
the
long
line
of
desmonds
all
distinguished
and
with
charming
manners
the
school
roared
its
satisfaction
john
stood
a
little
back
by
the
cloisters
cæsar
ran
past
him
down
the
steps
and
into
the
street
hat
in
hand
blushing
like
a
girl
john
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
thrilled
because
glory
shone
about
his
friend
but
the
poignant
reflection
came
that
cæsar
was
running
swiftly
out
of
the
yard
and
out
of
his
own
life
and
before
he
saw
what
he
had
seen
in
fancy
a
thousand
times
cæsar
with
scaife
and
the
captain
of
the
eleven
cæsar
in
his
new
straw
looking
happier
than
john
had
ever
seen
him
cæsar
the
blood
rolling
triumphantly
down
the
high
street
the
envied
of
all
beholders
the
hero
of
the
hour
john
called
himself
a
selfish
beast
because
he
had
wished
for
one
terrible
moment
wished
with
heart
and
soul
that
cæsar
was
unpopular
and
obscure
footnotes
the
place
of
execution
finding
is
the
privilege
accorded
to
the
sixth
form
of
having
breakfast
and
tea
served
in
their
own
rooms
instead
of
in
hall
the
straw
hat
only
worn
by
members
of
the
school
cricket
eleven
chapter
xi
friend
of
my
infinite
dreams
little
enough
endures
little
it
seems
it
is
yours
all
yours
fame
hath
a
fleeting
breath
hope
may
be
frail
or
fond
but
love
shall
be
love
till
death
and
perhaps
beyond
until
the
metropolitan
railway
joined
harrow
to
baker
street
the
hill
stood
in
the
midst
of
genuine
and
unspoilt
country
separated
by
five
miles
of
grass
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
metropolis
and
encompassed
by
isolated
dwellings
ranging
in
rank
and
scale
from
villas
to
country
houses
most
of
the
latter
have
fallen
victims
to
the
speculative
builder
and
have
been
cut
up
into
alleys
of
brick
and
stucco
but
one
or
two
still
remain
among
their
hayfields
and
rhododendrons
john
verney
had
an
eager
curiosity
not
common
in
schoolboys
to
know
something
about
the
countryside
in
which
he
dwelt
as
a
lower
boy
whenever
released
from
compulsory
and
he
used
to
wander
with
alert
eyes
and
ears
up
and
down
the
green
lanes
of
roxeth
and
harrow
weald
enjoying
fresh
glimpses
of
the
spire
making
friends
with
cottagers
picking
up
traditions
of
an
older
and
more
lawless
epoch
and
with
these
an
love
and
loyalty
to
harrow
so
byron
had
wandered
a
hundred
years
before
these
solitary
rambles
however
were
regarded
with
disfavour
by
schoolfellows
who
lacked
john
imaginative
temperament
the
caterpillar
for
instance
protested
did
i
see
you
hobnobbing
with
a
chaw
the
other
day
i
thought
so
and
you
looked
like
a
confounded
bughunter
the
duffer
notions
of
topography
were
bounded
by
the
on
the
one
side
of
the
hill
and
the
on
the
other
and
his
traditions
held
nothing
much
more
romantic
than
webbe
scores
at
lord
fluff
as
has
been
said
was
too
far
removed
from
john
to
make
him
more
than
an
occasional
companion
and
so
for
several
terms
john
for
the
most
part
walked
alone
by
the
time
desmond
joined
him
he
had
gleaned
a
knowledge
which
fascinated
a
friend
of
like
sensibility
and
imagination
together
they
revisited
the
old
and
explored
the
new
one
day
the
boys
discovered
a
deserted
house
of
some
pretensions
about
a
mile
from
the
hill
its
grounds
covering
several
acres
were
enclosed
by
a
high
oak
paling
within
which
stood
a
thick
belt
of
trees
effectually
concealing
what
lay
beyond
grim
iron
gates
always
locked
frowned
upon
the
wayfarer
but
john
flattening
an
inquisitive
nose
against
the
ironwork
could
discern
a
overgrown
with
grass
and
weeds
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
white
stone
portico
after
this
the
place
became
to
both
boys
a
sort
of
enchanted
castle
a
dozen
times
they
peered
through
the
gates
no
one
went
in
or
out
of
the
drive
the
gatekeeper
lodge
was
uninhabited
there
were
no
adjacent
cottages
where
information
might
be
sought
the
boys
called
it
the
haunted
house
and
peopled
it
with
ghosts
gorgeous
bucks
of
the
regency
languishing
beauties
such
as
lawrence
painted
fiery
politicians
duellists
mysterious
foreigners
john
connected
it
in
fancy
with
the
days
when
the
gorgeous
duke
of
chandos
who
had
handel
for
his
and
was
a
governor
of
harrow
and
guardian
of
lord
rodney
kept
court
at
cannons
he
told
cæsar
anecdotes
of
parr
with
his
preposterous
wig
his
clouds
of
tobacco
his
sesquipedalian
quotations
coming
down
from
stanmore
and
also
of
the
great
lord
abercorn
another
governor
of
the
school
who
used
to
go
out
shooting
in
the
blue
riband
of
the
garter
and
who
entertained
pitt
and
sir
walter
scott
at
bentley
priory
what
a
lot
you
know
said
cæsar
and
you
have
a
memory
like
my
father
i
beginning
to
think
jonathan
that
you
be
a
swell
like
him
some
day
in
the
cabinet
perhaps
ah
said
john
with
shining
eyes
i
hope
i
shall
live
to
see
it
desmond
added
with
feeling
thanks
old
chap
a
crust
or
a
triumph
shared
with
a
pal
tastes
twice
as
good
one
soft
afternoon
in
spring
after
four
bill
desmond
and
john
were
approaching
the
iron
gates
of
the
haunted
house
they
had
not
taken
this
particular
walk
since
the
day
when
desmond
got
his
flannels
during
the
winter
term
scaife
and
desmond
became
members
of
the
football
eleven
during
this
term
scaife
won
the
hundred
yards
and
desmond
won
the
and
mile
in
a
word
they
had
done
from
the
athletic
point
of
view
nearly
all
that
could
be
done
a
glorious
victory
at
lord
seemed
assured
scaife
captain
and
epitome
of
the
brains
and
muscles
of
the
eleven
had
grown
into
a
powerful
man
with
the
mind
the
tastes
the
passions
of
manhood
desmond
on
the
other
hand
while
nearly
as
tall
and
much
handsomer
in
john
eyes
still
retained
the
look
of
youth
indeed
he
looked
younger
than
john
although
a
year
his
senior
and
john
knew
himself
to
be
the
elder
and
wiser
knew
that
desmond
leaned
upon
him
whenever
a
crutch
was
wanted
the
chief
difficulty
which
besets
a
school
friendship
between
two
boys
is
that
of
being
alone
together
in
form
in
the
in
the
life
is
public
even
in
the
most
secluded
lane
a
harrow
boy
is
not
secure
against
the
unwelcome
salutations
of
heated
athletes
who
have
been
taking
a
run
or
leaping
over
or
into
the
pinner
brook
to
john
the
need
of
sanctuary
had
become
pressing
upon
this
blessed
spring
afternoon
ever
afterwards
recalled
with
special
affection
a
retreat
was
suddenly
provided
as
the
boys
jumped
over
the
last
stile
into
the
lane
which
led
to
the
haunted
house
desmond
exclaimed
by
jove
the
gates
are
open
then
they
saw
that
a
man
a
sort
of
caretaker
was
in
the
act
of
shutting
them
may
we
go
in
john
asked
civilly
the
man
hesitated
eyeing
the
boys
desmond
smile
melted
him
as
it
would
have
melted
a
mummy
there
nothing
to
see
he
said
then
in
answer
to
a
few
eager
questions
he
told
the
story
of
the
haunted
house
haunted
indeed
by
the
ghosts
of
what
might
have
been
a
city
magnate
owned
the
place
he
had
bought
it
because
he
wished
to
educate
his
only
son
at
harrow
as
a
or
a
few
weeks
before
the
boy
should
have
joined
the
school
he
fell
ill
with
diphtheria
and
died
the
mother
who
nursed
him
caught
the
disease
and
died
also
the
father
left
alone
turned
his
back
upon
a
place
he
loathed
resolving
to
hold
it
till
increased
but
never
to
set
eyes
on
it
again
the
caretaker
and
his
wife
occupied
a
couple
of
rooms
in
the
house
the
boys
glanced
at
the
house
a
mansion
and
began
to
explore
the
gardens
to
their
delight
they
found
in
the
shrubberies
now
a
wilderness
of
laurel
and
rhododendron
a
tower
what
our
forefathers
called
a
gazebo
and
their
neighbours
a
folly
the
top
of
it
commanded
a
wide
unbroken
view
of
all
the
lowland
western
lea
the
uxbridge
flats
and
meadows
to
where
the
ruislip
waters
see
the
oxhey
lights
and
shadows
there
the
spire
said
john
the
man
who
had
joined
them
nodded
yes
said
he
and
my
mistress
and
her
boy
are
buried
underneath
it
she
wanted
him
to
be
there
at
the
school
i
mean
and
there
he
is
we
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
desmond
he
slipped
a
shilling
into
the
man
hand
and
added
may
we
stay
here
for
a
bit
and
perhaps
we
might
come
again
eh
thank
you
sir
the
man
replied
touching
his
hat
come
whenever
you
like
sir
the
gates
ai
really
locked
i
show
you
the
trick
of
opening
when
you
come
down
he
descended
the
steep
flight
of
steps
after
the
boys
had
thanked
him
sad
story
said
john
staring
at
the
distant
spire
desmond
hesitated
at
times
he
revealed
to
john
alone
a
curious
melancholy
sad
he
repeated
i
do
know
about
that
sad
for
the
father
of
course
but
perhaps
the
son
is
well
out
of
it
do
look
so
amazed
jonathan
most
fellows
seem
to
make
awful
muddles
of
their
lives
you
wo
of
course
i
see
you
on
pinnacles
but
i
he
broke
off
with
a
mirthless
laugh
john
waited
the
air
about
them
was
soft
and
moist
after
a
recent
shower
the
wind
stirred
the
pulses
earth
was
once
more
tumid
about
to
bring
forth
already
the
hedges
were
green
under
the
brown
bulbs
were
pushing
delicate
spears
through
the
soil
the
buds
upon
a
clump
of
fine
beeches
had
begun
to
open
in
this
solitude
alone
with
teeming
nature
john
tried
to
interpret
his
friend
mood
but
the
spirit
of
melancholy
eluded
him
as
if
it
were
a
dancing
over
an
impassable
marsh
suddenly
there
came
to
him
as
there
had
come
to
the
quicker
imagination
of
his
friend
the
overpowering
mystery
of
spring
the
sense
of
inevitable
change
the
impossibility
of
arresting
it
at
the
moment
all
things
seemed
unsubstantial
even
the
familiar
spire
powdered
with
gold
by
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
appeared
thinly
transparent
against
the
rosy
mists
behind
it
the
hill
the
solid
hill
rose
out
of
the
valley
a
shade
upon
the
horizon
he
came
here
continued
desmond
dreamily
john
guessed
that
he
was
speaking
of
the
father
a
rich
prosperous
man
i
dare
say
he
worked
like
a
slave
in
the
city
and
he
wanted
peace
and
quiet
after
the
stock
exchange
who
would
and
he
planted
out
these
gardens
thinking
that
every
plant
would
grow
up
and
thrive
and
his
son
with
them
and
then
the
boy
died
and
the
wife
followed
and
the
enchanted
castle
became
a
place
of
horror
and
now
it
is
a
wilderness
haunted
i
should
think
it
was
haunted
i
wish
we
never
set
foot
in
it
there
a
curse
on
it
let
go
said
john
too
late
we
stay
now
and
we
come
again
every
sunday
wild
and
desolate
as
things
look
they
will
be
lovely
when
we
get
back
in
summer
do
talk
i
going
to
light
a
pipe
through
the
circling
cloud
of
john
stared
at
the
face
which
had
illumined
nearly
every
hour
of
his
its
peculiar
vividness
always
amazed
john
the
vitality
of
it
and
yet
the
perfect
delicacy
scaife
handsome
features
were
full
of
vitality
also
but
coarseness
underlay
their
bold
lines
and
peered
out
of
the
keen
flashing
eyes
when
the
caterpillar
left
harrow
he
had
said
to
john
jonathan
awful
rot
your
going
to
such
a
hole
as
oxford
one
has
had
quite
enough
schooling
after
five
years
here
it
settled
going
into
the
guards
my
father
tells
me
that
old
scaife
tried
to
get
the
demon
down
on
the
duke
list
but
we
do
fancy
the
scaife
brand
often
and
often
john
wondered
whether
desmond
saw
the
brand
as
plainly
as
the
caterpillar
and
he
did
sometimes
he
felt
almost
sure
that
a
word
a
look
a
gesture
betraying
the
bounder
had
revolted
desmond
but
a
few
hours
later
the
bounder
bounded
into
favour
again
captivating
eye
and
heart
by
some
brilliant
feat
and
then
his
brains
he
was
so
diabolically
clever
john
could
always
recall
his
face
as
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
in
no
sick
bruised
befuddled
and
yet
even
in
that
moment
of
extreme
prostration
able
to
play
the
game
as
he
put
it
to
defeat
and
doctor
by
sheer
strength
of
will
and
intellect
it
was
scaife
who
had
persuaded
desmond
to
smoke
cæsar
voice
broke
in
upon
these
meditations
i
say
what
are
you
frowning
about
john
very
red
replied
nervously
now
that
you
in
the
sixth
you
ought
to
chuck
smoking
what
rot
said
cæsar
and
here
in
this
tower
where
one
possibly
be
nailed
that
it
said
john
it
just
because
you
ca
possibly
be
nailed
that
it
seems
to
me
not
quite
square
cæsar
burst
out
laughing
jonathan
you
a
rum
anyway
here
goes
as
he
spoke
he
flung
the
pipe
into
the
bushes
below
thanks
said
john
quietly
we
come
here
again
i
like
this
old
tower
you
wo
come
here
without
me
oh
ho
i
not
to
let
the
demon
into
our
paradise
eh
what
a
jealous
old
bird
you
are
well
i
like
you
to
be
jealous
and
he
laughed
again
i
am
jealous
said
john
slowly
the
school
broke
up
on
the
following
tuesday
and
desmond
went
home
with
john
this
happened
to
be
the
first
time
that
the
friends
had
spent
easter
together
john
wondered
whether
cæsar
would
take
the
sacrament
with
his
mother
and
him
he
and
cæsar
had
been
confirmed
side
by
side
in
the
chapel
at
harrow
he
felt
sure
that
desmond
would
not
refuse
if
he
were
asked
on
easter
eve
verney
said
in
her
quiet
persuasive
voice
you
will
join
us
morning
harry
desmond
flushed
and
said
yes
not
remembering
his
own
mother
who
had
died
when
he
was
a
child
he
often
told
john
that
he
felt
like
a
son
to
verney
upon
easter
morning
the
three
met
in
the
hall
and
desmond
asked
for
a
i
lost
mine
he
murmured
that
afternoon
when
they
were
alone
upon
the
splendid
moor
above
stoneycross
desmond
said
suddenly
religion
means
a
lot
to
you
jonathan
does
it
yes
but
you
never
talk
about
it
no
why
not
i
do
know
how
to
begin
there
such
sickening
hypocrisy
in
this
world
john
nodded
but
your
religion
is
a
help
to
you
eh
keeps
you
straight
john
nodded
again
then
desmond
said
with
an
air
of
finality
i
wish
i
some
of
your
faith
i
want
it
badly
if
you
want
it
badly
you
will
get
it
a
long
silence
succeeded
then
desmond
exclaimed
hullo
by
jove
there
a
fox
a
splendid
fellow
he
come
up
here
amongst
the
rabbits
for
a
sunday
dinner
gone
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
halloaed
a
minute
later
he
was
talking
of
hunting
religion
was
not
mentioned
till
they
were
approaching
the
house
for
tea
on
the
threshold
desmond
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
like
your
mother
to
give
me
a
a
small
one
nothing
expensive
during
the
following
week
they
hunted
with
foxhounds
or
staghounds
every
day
except
wednesday
in
the
new
forest
the
easter
hunting
is
unique
tremendous
fellows
come
down
from
the
shires
masters
of
famous
packs
thrusters
keen
to
see
may
foxes
killed
and
the
forest
entertains
them
handsomely
you
may
be
sure
big
hampers
are
unpacked
under
the
oaks
which
may
have
been
saplings
when
william
rufus
ruled
in
england
there
are
dinners
and
of
course
a
in
the
ancient
village
of
lyndhurst
but
as
each
pleasant
day
passed
john
told
himself
that
the
end
was
drawing
near
this
was
almost
the
last
holidays
cæsar
and
he
would
spend
together
and
afterwards
would
this
friendship
so
romantic
a
passion
with
one
at
least
of
them
would
it
wither
away
or
would
it
endure
to
the
end
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
desmond
returned
to
eaton
square
upon
the
eve
of
departure
verney
gave
him
a
small
i
have
written
something
in
it
she
said
but
do
open
it
now
he
looked
at
the
as
the
train
rolled
out
of
lyndhurst
station
upon
it
in
verney
delicate
handwriting
were
a
few
lines
first
his
name
and
the
date
below
a
text
unto
whomsoever
much
is
given
of
him
shall
be
much
required
and
below
that
again
a
verse
not
thankful
when
it
pleaseth
me
as
if
thy
blessings
had
spare
days
but
such
a
heart
whose
pulse
may
be
thy
praise
desmond
stared
at
the
graceful
writing
long
after
the
train
had
passed
totton
am
i
ungrateful
he
asked
himself
not
to
them
he
muttered
surely
not
to
them
he
recalled
what
warde
had
said
about
ingratitude
being
the
unpardonable
sin
ah
it
was
loathsome
ingratitude
and
much
had
been
given
to
him
how
much
for
the
first
time
he
made
so
to
speak
an
inventory
of
what
he
had
received
his
innumerable
blessings
had
he
given
in
return
and
now
the
fine
handwriting
seemed
blurred
he
saw
it
through
tears
which
he
ought
to
have
shed
oh
my
god
he
murmured
am
i
ungrateful
the
question
bit
deeper
into
his
mind
sinking
from
there
into
his
soul
when
the
school
reassembled
a
curious
incident
occurred
john
happened
to
be
going
up
the
fine
flight
of
steps
that
leads
to
the
old
schools
he
was
carrying
some
books
and
papers
scaife
running
down
the
steps
charged
into
him
by
great
good
fortune
no
damage
was
done
except
to
a
sophocles
john
however
felt
assured
that
scaife
had
deliberately
intended
to
knock
him
down
seized
possibly
by
an
ecstasy
of
blind
rage
not
uncommon
with
him
scaife
smiled
derisively
and
said
a
thousand
apologies
verney
is
enough
john
replied
if
it
is
sincere
they
eyed
each
other
steadily
john
read
a
furious
challenge
in
bold
eyes
more
a
menace
the
threatening
frown
of
power
thwarted
scaife
seemed
to
expand
to
fill
the
horizon
to
blot
out
the
glad
sunshine
once
again
the
curious
certainty
gripped
the
younger
that
scaife
was
indeed
the
personification
of
evil
the
more
malefic
because
it
stalked
abroad
masked
for
scaife
had
outlived
his
reputation
as
a
breaker
of
the
law
since
that
terrible
experience
in
the
fourth
form
room
he
had
paid
tithe
of
mint
and
cummin
as
a
sixth
form
boy
he
upheld
authority
laughing
the
while
in
his
sleeve
he
knew
of
course
that
one
mistake
one
slip
would
be
fatal
and
he
prided
himself
on
not
making
mistakes
he
gambled
but
not
with
boys
he
drank
not
with
boys
he
denied
his
body
nothing
it
craved
but
he
never
forgot
that
expulsion
from
harrow
meant
the
loss
of
a
commission
in
a
smart
cavalry
regiment
when
it
was
intimated
to
him
that
the
guards
did
not
want
his
son
he
laughed
bitterly
and
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
show
the
snobs
what
a
soldier
they
had
turned
away
a
soldier
he
fully
intended
to
be
a
dashing
cavalry
leader
if
the
fates
were
kind
his
luck
would
stand
by
him
if
not
why
what
was
life
without
luck
he
had
never
been
a
reader
but
he
read
now
the
lives
of
soldiers
murat
uxbridge
cardigan
hodson
were
his
heroes
talking
of
their
achievements
he
inflamed
his
own
mind
and
desmond
the
pleasant
summer
days
passed
may
melted
into
june
and
each
sunday
john
and
desmond
walked
to
the
haunted
house
ascended
the
tower
and
talked
scaife
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
summer
desmond
was
staying
on
for
the
winter
term
then
john
would
have
him
entirely
to
himself
this
thought
illumined
dark
hours
when
he
saw
his
friend
whirled
away
by
scaife
transported
as
it
were
by
the
irresistible
power
of
the
man
of
action
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
to
that
youth
he
had
helped
to
win
the
public
schools
racquets
championship
the
manor
was
now
the
crack
house
at
racquets
and
football
certain
to
be
at
cricket
and
scaife
got
most
of
the
credit
not
warde
who
smiled
more
than
ever
and
talked
continually
of
balliol
scholarships
he
never
bragged
of
victories
past
meantime
john
was
devoting
all
energies
to
the
competition
for
the
prize
essay
the
head
master
had
propounded
as
theme
the
history
and
influence
of
parliamentary
oratory
bit
by
bit
john
read
or
declaimed
it
to
desmond
then
according
to
custom
desmond
copied
it
out
for
his
friend
signed
with
a
sealed
envelope
containing
john
name
inside
and
the
motto
outside
the
was
placed
in
the
head
master
john
cooling
rapidly
after
the
fever
of
composition
condemned
his
stuff
as
hopelessly
bad
cæsar
went
about
telling
everybody
that
jonathan
would
win
easily
with
a
bit
to
spare
john
did
win
but
that
proved
to
be
the
least
part
of
his
triumph
the
essay
had
to
be
declaimed
upon
speech
day
once
more
john
experienced
the
pangs
that
had
twisted
him
at
the
concert
long
ago
when
he
had
sung
to
the
nation
hero
and
as
before
he
began
weakly
then
the
fire
seizing
him
was
exorcised
by
feeling
and
forgetful
of
the
hundreds
of
faces
about
him
he
burst
into
genuine
oratory
thrilled
himself
he
thrilled
others
his
voice
faltered
again
but
with
an
emotion
that
found
an
echo
in
the
hearts
of
his
audience
his
hand
shook
feeling
the
pulse
of
old
and
young
in
front
of
him
dominated
swept
away
by
his
theme
he
dominated
others
when
he
finished
in
the
silence
that
preceded
the
roar
of
applause
he
knew
that
he
had
triumphed
for
he
saw
desmond
glowing
countenance
radiant
with
pleasure
transfigured
by
amazement
and
admiration
next
day
a
great
newspaper
hailed
the
harrow
boy
as
one
destined
to
delight
and
to
lead
perhaps
an
party
in
the
house
of
commons
and
yet
warmed
to
the
core
by
this
praise
john
counted
it
as
nothing
compared
with
his
mother
smile
and
desmond
fervent
grip
fortune
however
comes
to
no
man
or
boy
with
both
hands
full
immediately
after
speech
day
john
bubble
of
pride
and
happiness
was
pricked
by
scaife
midsummer
madness
seized
the
demon
one
may
conceive
that
the
innate
recklessness
of
his
nature
suppressed
by
an
iron
will
and
smouldering
throughout
many
months
burst
at
last
into
flame
desmond
told
john
that
the
demon
had
spent
a
riotous
night
in
town
he
had
slipped
out
of
the
manor
after
prayers
had
driven
up
to
a
certain
club
in
regent
street
returned
in
time
for
first
school
fresh
as
paint
so
desmond
said
and
then
not
content
with
such
an
achievement
must
needs
brag
of
it
to
desmond
and
if
he
nailed
eton
wins
concluded
desmond
i
told
you
because
together
we
must
put
a
stop
to
such
larks
john
slightly
raised
his
thick
eyebrows
it
was
curious
that
cæsar
always
chose
to
ignore
the
hatred
which
he
must
have
known
to
exist
between
his
two
friends
or
did
he
fatuously
believe
that
because
john
exercised
an
influence
over
himself
the
same
influence
would
or
could
be
exercised
over
scaife
we
said
john
i
tried
and
failed
but
together
i
say
i
sha
interfere
cæsar
jonathan
you
must
it
would
be
a
fool
errand
we
three
have
gone
up
the
school
together
you
have
never
been
fair
to
scaife
i
tell
you
he
sound
at
core
why
after
he
was
swished
desmond
told
john
what
had
passed
john
shook
his
head
he
could
understand
better
than
any
one
else
why
scaife
had
broken
down
he
has
splendid
ambitions
pursued
desmond
he
going
to
be
a
great
soldier
you
see
he
thinks
of
nothing
else
you
never
have
liked
him
but
because
of
that
i
thought
you
would
do
what
you
could
the
disappointment
and
chagrin
in
his
voice
shook
john
resolution
to
please
you
i
try
and
accordingly
the
absurd
experiment
was
made
afterwards
john
asked
himself
a
thousand
times
why
he
had
not
foreseen
the
inevitable
result
but
the
explanation
is
almost
too
simple
to
be
recorded
he
wished
to
convince
a
friend
that
he
would
attempt
anything
to
prove
his
friendship
that
night
they
went
together
to
scaife
room
the
room
in
the
manor
situated
upon
the
first
floor
it
overlooked
the
back
of
the
garden
where
there
was
a
tangled
thicket
of
laurustinus
and
rhododendron
scaife
had
spent
much
money
in
making
this
room
as
comfortable
as
possible
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
room
and
presented
all
the
characteristics
of
the
man
who
lived
in
it
everything
connected
with
scaife
triumphal
march
through
the
school
was
preserved
on
the
walls
were
his
caps
fezes
and
cups
you
could
hardly
see
the
paper
for
the
framed
photographs
of
scaife
and
his
fellow
bloods
scaife
as
cricketer
scaife
as
scaife
as
and
athlete
stared
boldly
and
triumphantly
at
you
he
had
a
fine
desk
covered
with
massive
silver
ornaments
upon
this
as
upon
everything
else
in
the
room
was
the
of
the
successful
man
of
business
the
papers
the
pens
and
pencils
the
filed
bills
and
letters
the
books
of
reference
spoke
eloquently
of
a
mind
that
used
order
as
a
means
to
a
definite
end
all
his
books
were
well
bound
his
boots
were
on
trees
his
racquets
were
in
their
press
had
you
opened
his
chest
of
drawers
you
would
have
found
his
clothes
in
perfect
condition
obviously
to
an
observant
eye
the
owner
of
this
room
gave
his
mind
to
details
because
he
realized
that
on
details
hang
great
and
successful
enterprises
scaife
stared
at
john
but
welcomed
him
civilly
enough
cricket
of
course
explained
this
unexpected
visit
as
desmond
blurted
out
what
was
in
his
mind
scaife
frowned
then
he
laughed
unpleasantly
and
so
i
told
jonathan
concluded
desmond
so
you
told
jonathan
repeated
scaife
are
you
in
the
habit
of
telling
jonathan
the
derisive
inflection
as
he
pronounced
the
name
warned
john
at
least
that
he
had
much
better
have
stayed
away
things
which
concern
others
and
which
do
concern
him
if
you
going
to
take
it
like
that
keep
cool
cæsar
i
admit
that
you
mean
well
i
should
like
to
hear
what
verney
has
to
say
at
that
john
spoke
haltingly
fluent
speech
upon
any
subject
very
dear
to
him
had
always
been
difficult
he
could
talk
glibly
enough
about
ordinary
topics
his
sense
of
humour
his
retentive
memory
made
him
welcome
even
in
the
critical
society
of
eaton
square
but
you
know
him
as
a
creature
of
unplumbed
reserves
the
matter
in
hand
was
so
vital
that
he
could
not
touch
it
with
firm
hands
or
voice
he
spoke
at
his
worst
and
he
knew
it
concluding
an
incoherent
and
slightly
inarticulate
recital
of
the
reasons
which
ought
to
keep
scaife
in
his
house
at
night
with
a
lame
two
heads
ought
to
prevail
against
one
scaife
showed
his
fine
teeth
you
think
that
your
head
and
against
mine
the
challenge
revealed
itself
in
the
derisive
sneering
tone
john
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
rose
i
have
blundered
i
am
sorry
hold
hard
said
scaife
he
read
censure
upon
desmond
ingenuous
countenance
then
his
temper
whipped
him
to
a
furious
resentment
against
john
as
an
enemy
who
had
turned
the
tables
with
good
breeding
who
had
gained
indeed
a
victory
against
odds
scaife
drew
in
his
breath
his
brows
met
in
a
frown
you
have
not
blundered
and
you
are
not
sorry
he
said
deliberately
i
not
a
fool
verney
but
perhaps
i
have
underrated
your
ability
you
as
clever
as
they
make
you
knew
well
enough
that
you
were
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
lead
me
in
a
string
you
knew
that
i
say
and
yet
you
come
here
to
pose
as
the
righteous
youth
doing
his
duty
eh
against
odds
and
accepting
credit
for
the
same
from
cæsar
why
it
plain
to
me
as
the
nose
upon
your
face
that
in
your
heart
you
would
like
me
to
be
sacked
desmond
interrupted
you
are
mad
demon
take
that
back
take
it
back
ask
him
said
scaife
he
hates
me
and
common
decency
ought
to
have
kept
him
out
of
this
room
but
he
not
a
liar
ask
him
put
it
your
own
way
soften
it
make
pap
of
it
if
you
like
but
get
an
answer
jonathan
it
is
not
true
is
it
you
do
like
scaife
but
you
would
be
sorry
very
sorry
to
see
him
sacked
i
glad
you
not
funked
it
said
scaife
you
put
it
squarely
let
him
answer
it
as
squarely
john
was
white
to
the
lips
white
and
trembling
despicable
in
his
own
eyes
how
much
more
despicable
therefore
in
the
eyes
of
his
friend
whose
passionate
faith
in
him
was
about
to
be
scorched
and
shrivelled
scaife
began
to
laugh
for
god
sake
do
laugh
said
desmond
jonathan
i
know
you
are
too
proud
to
defend
yourself
against
such
an
abominable
charge
he
not
a
liar
said
scaife
it
true
said
john
in
a
strangled
voice
you
have
wished
that
he
might
be
sacked
yes
john
met
desmond
indignant
eyes
with
an
expression
which
the
other
was
too
impetuous
too
inexperienced
to
interpret
into
that
look
of
passionate
reproach
he
flung
all
that
must
be
left
unsaid
all
that
scaife
could
read
as
easily
as
if
it
were
scored
in
letters
of
flame
because
in
his
modesty
and
humility
he
had
ever
reckoned
that
scaife
would
prevail
against
himself
because
with
unerring
instinct
he
had
apprehended
as
few
boys
could
apprehend
the
issues
involved
he
had
desired
fervently
desired
that
scaife
should
be
swept
from
path
but
this
he
could
not
plead
as
an
excuse
to
his
friend
and
scaife
had
known
that
and
had
used
his
knowledge
with
fiendish
success
john
lowered
his
eyes
and
walked
from
the
room
when
he
met
desmond
again
nothing
was
said
on
either
side
john
told
himself
that
he
would
speak
if
desmond
spoke
first
but
evidently
desmond
had
determined
already
the
nature
of
their
future
relations
they
no
longer
shared
no
john
being
in
the
upper
sixth
with
a
room
to
himself
but
they
still
found
together
to
separate
would
mean
a
public
scandal
from
which
each
shrank
in
horror
no
let
them
meet
at
meals
as
before
till
the
end
of
the
term
indeed
so
little
change
was
made
in
their
previous
intercourse
that
john
began
to
hope
that
cæsar
would
walk
with
him
as
usual
upon
the
following
sunday
and
if
he
did
if
he
did
john
felt
that
he
would
speak
on
the
top
of
the
tower
looking
towards
the
spire
alone
with
his
friend
exalted
above
the
thorns
and
brambles
of
the
wilderness
words
would
come
to
him
but
on
the
following
sunday
desmond
walked
with
scaife
footnotes
of
these
the
park
now
a
was
a
characteristic
specimen
it
belonged
to
lord
northwick
lord
of
the
manor
of
harrow
in
the
thirties
harrow
boys
played
jack
o
lantern
or
nocturnal
hare
and
hounds
they
used
to
attend
kingsbury
races
and
pinner
fair
lord
alexander
russell
when
he
was
a
boy
at
the
grove
kept
a
pack
of
beagles
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
chapter
xii
lord
there
we
sat
in
the
circle
vast
hard
by
the
tents
from
noon
and
looked
as
the
day
went
slowly
past
and
the
runs
came
all
too
soon
and
never
i
think
in
the
years
gone
by
since
cricketer
first
went
in
did
the
dying
so
refuse
to
die
or
the
winning
so
hardly
win
my
dear
jonathan
i
delighted
to
see
you
you
know
my
father
i
think
it
was
the
caterpillar
that
spoke
john
shook
hands
with
colonel
egerton
the
three
were
standing
in
the
members
enclosure
at
lord
the
caterpillar
gorgeous
in
with
three
in
the
lapel
of
it
was
about
as
great
a
buck
as
his
sire
quite
as
conspicuous
and
seemingly
as
cool
it
happened
to
be
a
blazing
hot
day
but
heat
seldom
affected
colonel
egerton
by
jove
he
said
to
john
i
told
it
a
certainty
this
year
and
i
come
early
too
early
for
me
to
see
a
glorious
victory
civil
war
raging
on
the
top
of
the
trent
coach
i
give
you
my
word
we
won
the
toss
said
john
ah
there
charles
desmond
an
early
bird
too
he
bustled
away
leaving
john
and
the
caterpillar
together
the
great
ground
in
front
of
them
was
being
cleared
one
could
see
through
the
few
people
scattered
here
and
there
the
wickets
pitched
in
the
middle
of
that
vast
expanse
of
lawn
and
the
umpires
in
their
long
white
coats
upon
the
top
of
the
steps
in
the
middle
of
the
pavilion
the
eton
captain
was
collecting
his
eleven
the
duffer
who
had
got
his
flannels
at
the
last
moment
came
up
and
joined
john
and
the
caterpillar
the
manor
well
to
the
front
said
the
caterpillar
by
jove
i
never
thought
to
see
fluff
in
the
eleven
fluff
came
on
tremendously
this
term
the
duffer
replied
of
course
the
kinlochs
are
a
cricketing
family
good
joke
the
brothers
playing
against
each
other
said
john
warde
the
duffer
nodded
in
the
direction
of
warde
who
was
talking
with
charles
desmond
and
colonel
egerton
has
worked
like
a
slave
he
made
a
cricketer
out
of
fluff
and
a
scholar
out
of
jonathan
he
so
mad
keen
to
see
us
win
that
he
given
me
the
jumps
you
must
keep
cool
the
caterpillar
murmured
i
just
come
from
the
trent
coach
fluff
has
it
from
the
brother
who
is
playing
that
the
eton
bowling
is
weak
but
strathpeffer
the
eldest
son
tells
me
the
batsmen
are
stronger
than
last
year
he
seemed
anxious
to
bet
so
we
have
a
fiver
about
it
they
taking
the
field
the
eton
eleven
walked
towards
the
wicket
loudly
cheered
cæsar
came
up
in
his
pads
carrying
his
bat
and
gloves
he
shook
hands
with
the
caterpillar
and
said
with
a
groan
that
he
had
to
take
the
first
ball
keep
cool
said
the
caterpillar
the
bowling
weak
i
have
it
from
cosmo
kinloch
they
in
a
precious
funk
so
am
i
said
the
duffer
but
you
a
bowler
said
desmond
if
i
get
out
first
ball
i
shall
cut
my
throat
but
cæsar
looked
alert
cool
and
neither
nor
you
cut
the
ball
not
your
throat
said
the
duffer
cutting
was
cæsar
strong
point
the
caterpillar
nodded
and
spoke
oracularly
my
governor
says
he
never
shoots
at
a
snipe
without
muttering
to
himself
on
toast
it
steadies
his
nerves
when
you
see
the
ball
leave
the
bowler
hand
you
say
to
yourself
on
toast
your
own
caterpillar
my
own
said
the
caterpillar
modestly
i
do
often
make
a
joke
but
that
mine
pass
it
on
the
other
harrovian
about
to
go
in
beckoned
to
desmond
cæsar
wo
be
bowled
first
ball
said
the
caterpillar
he
the
sort
that
rises
to
an
emergency
ca
we
find
a
seat
they
sat
down
and
watched
the
eton
captain
placing
his
field
desmond
and
his
companion
were
walking
slowly
towards
the
wickets
amid
harrow
cheers
the
cheering
was
lukewarm
as
yet
it
would
have
fire
enough
in
it
presently
the
caterpillar
pointed
out
some
of
the
swells
that
old
lyburn
has
missed
a
match
since
was
brought
here
once
with
a
broken
leg
carried
in
a
litter
by
jove
that
fellow
with
the
long
white
beard
is
lord
fawley
he
made
in
the
days
of
charlemagne
it
was
in
said
the
duffer
who
never
joked
on
really
serious
subjects
and
he
made
not
he
pulling
his
beard
i
believe
he
as
nervous
as
i
am
presently
the
innumerable
voices
about
them
were
hushed
all
eyes
turned
in
one
direction
desmond
was
about
to
take
the
first
ball
it
was
delivered
moderately
fast
with
a
slight
break
desmond
played
forward
well
played
sir
well
the
shout
rumbled
round
the
huge
circle
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
a
great
match
are
always
thrilling
the
second
and
third
balls
were
played
like
the
first
john
could
hear
desmond
saying
to
warde
he
has
hugo
style
and
way
of
standing
eh
and
warde
replied
yes
but
a
finer
batsman
the
first
real
cheer
burst
like
a
bomb
desmond
had
cut
the
sixth
ball
to
the
boundary
over
the
new
bowler
was
a
tall
thin
boy
with
flaxen
hair
that
cosmo
kinloch
fluff
brother
said
john
i
wonder
they
do
better
than
that
even
i
knocked
him
all
over
the
shop
at
white
ladies
last
summer
he
come
on
they
tell
me
said
the
caterpillar
good
lord
he
nearly
had
him
first
ball
fluff
brother
bowled
slows
of
a
good
length
with
an
awkward
break
from
the
off
to
the
leg
teasers
said
the
caterpillar
critically
hullo
no
my
young
friend
that
may
do
well
enough
in
shropshire
not
here
a
ball
breaking
sharply
from
the
off
had
struck
the
batsman
pad
he
had
stepped
in
front
of
his
wicket
to
cut
it
country
umpires
are
often
beguiled
by
bowlers
into
giving
wrong
decisions
in
such
cases
not
so
your
london
expert
cosmo
kinloch
appealed
in
vain
he
send
a
short
one
down
now
said
john
you
see
and
sure
enough
a
long
hop
came
to
the
off
curling
inwards
after
it
pitched
the
eton
captain
had
nearly
all
his
men
on
the
off
side
the
harrovian
pulled
the
ball
right
round
to
the
boundary
well
hit
well
pulled
two
that
a
good
beginning
said
the
duffer
a
couple
of
singles
followed
and
then
the
first
went
up
amid
cheers
here
my
governor
said
the
duffer
he
was
three
years
in
the
eleven
and
captain
his
last
term
you
told
us
that
a
thousand
times
said
the
caterpillar
the
rev
septimus
duff
greeted
the
boys
warmly
his
eyes
sparkled
out
of
a
cheery
bearded
face
look
at
him
well
an
harrovian
of
the
harrovians
this
his
grandfathers
on
the
maternal
and
paternal
side
had
been
friends
at
harrow
in
byron
time
the
rev
septimus
wore
rather
a
shabby
coat
and
a
terrible
hat
but
the
consummate
caterpillar
who
respected
pedigrees
regarded
him
with
pride
and
veneration
he
came
up
from
his
obscure
west
country
vicarage
to
town
just
once
a
year
to
see
the
match
if
you
asked
him
he
would
tell
you
quite
simply
that
he
would
sooner
see
the
match
and
his
old
friends
than
go
to
palestine
and
the
rev
septimus
had
yearned
to
visit
palestine
ever
since
he
left
cambridge
and
it
is
not
likely
that
this
great
wish
will
ever
be
gratified
he
is
the
father
of
three
sons
but
the
duffer
is
the
first
to
get
into
the
eleven
charles
desmond
joins
them
at
the
moment
charles
desmond
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
most
harried
men
in
the
empire
times
are
troublous
a
as
large
as
kruger
hand
has
just
risen
in
the
south
and
is
spreading
itself
over
the
whole
world
but
the
great
minister
has
left
the
cares
of
office
in
downing
street
he
hails
the
rev
septimus
with
a
genial
laugh
and
a
hearty
grasp
of
the
hand
ah
sep
upon
your
word
of
honour
now
would
you
sooner
be
here
to
see
the
duffer
take
half
a
dozen
wickets
or
be
down
in
somerset
bishop
of
bath
and
wells
when
offer
me
the
bishopric
replied
the
rev
septimus
with
a
twinkle
i
answer
that
question
my
dear
charles
and
not
before
you
old
humbug
you
so
puffed
up
with
sinful
pride
that
you
stuck
your
topper
on
to
your
head
the
wrong
way
about
bless
my
soul
said
the
duffer
father
so
i
have
that
topper
of
the
governor
the
duffer
remarked
solemnly
has
seen
matches
at
least
john
looked
at
no
hats
his
eyes
were
on
the
pitch
another
round
of
cheers
proclaimed
that
had
gone
up
both
boys
are
batting
steadily
no
more
boundary
hits
a
snick
here
a
snack
there
and
then
merciful
heavens
cæsar
has
cut
a
curling
ball
bang
into
short
slip
hands
short
slip
wretched
youth
muffs
it
derisive
remarks
from
rev
septimus
well
caught
well
held
the
caterpillar
would
pronounce
this
sort
of
chaff
bad
form
in
a
contemporary
he
removes
his
hat
by
jove
says
he
it
very
warm
cæsar
times
the
next
ball
beautifully
it
glides
past
point
and
under
the
ropes
early
as
it
is
the
ground
seems
to
be
packed
with
people
glorious
weather
has
allured
everybody
stand
after
stand
is
filled
up
the
colour
becomes
kaleidoscopic
the
rev
septimus
during
the
brief
interval
of
an
over
allows
his
eyes
to
stray
round
the
huge
circle
upon
the
ground
are
the
youth
the
beauty
the
rank
and
fashion
of
the
kingdom
and
best
of
all
his
old
friends
the
rev
septimus
has
a
weakness
being
of
course
human
to
the
he
calls
himself
a
temporis
in
his
day
the
match
was
less
of
a
function
the
boys
sat
round
upon
the
grass
behind
them
were
the
carriages
and
coaches
you
could
drive
on
to
the
ground
then
and
here
and
there
only
here
and
there
a
tent
or
a
small
stand
the
parson
loves
a
latin
tag
the
match
was
an
immense
picnic
for
harrovians
and
etonians
and
my
word
you
ought
to
have
heard
the
chaff
when
an
unlucky
fielder
put
the
ball
on
the
floor
or
when
a
batsman
interposed
a
pad
where
a
bat
ought
to
have
been
or
if
a
player
was
bowled
first
ball
or
if
he
swaggered
as
he
walked
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
from
the
pavilion
to
the
pitch
upon
this
subject
the
rev
septimus
will
preach
a
longer
and
a
more
interesting
sermon
than
any
you
will
hear
from
his
pulpit
in
church
loud
cheers
put
an
end
to
the
parson
reminiscences
companion
has
been
clean
bowled
for
a
useful
fifteen
runs
he
walks
towards
the
pavilion
slowly
then
as
he
hears
the
harrow
cheers
he
blushes
like
a
nymph
of
sixteen
for
he
counts
himself
a
failure
last
year
he
made
a
duck
in
his
first
innings
and
five
in
the
second
no
cheers
then
this
is
his
first
taste
of
the
honey
mortals
call
success
he
has
faced
the
great
world
and
captured
its
applause
when
does
scaife
go
in
the
rev
septimus
asks
second
wicket
down
more
cheers
as
the
second
man
in
strolls
down
the
steps
a
careful
cove
so
the
duffer
tells
his
father
one
who
will
try
to
break
the
back
of
the
bowling
they
taking
off
fluff
brother
the
caterpillar
observes
a
young
man
holds
the
ball
he
makes
some
slight
alteration
in
the
field
the
stands
back
the
slips
and
point
retreat
a
few
yards
the
ball
that
took
the
first
wicket
was
the
last
of
an
over
desmond
has
to
receive
the
attack
of
the
new
bowler
the
etonian
having
arranged
the
off
side
to
his
satisfaction
prepares
to
take
a
long
run
he
holds
the
ball
in
the
left
hand
runs
sideways
at
great
speed
changes
the
ball
from
the
left
hand
to
the
right
at
the
last
moment
and
seems
to
hurl
both
it
and
himself
at
the
batsman
greased
lightning
says
john
a
dry
summer
had
made
the
pitch
rather
fiery
the
ball
whizzes
just
over
cæsar
head
a
second
and
a
third
seem
to
graze
his
cap
murmurs
are
heard
is
the
eton
bowler
trying
to
kill
or
maim
his
antagonist
is
he
deliberately
endeavouring
to
establish
a
paralysing
funk
but
the
fourth
ball
is
a
fizzer
the
right
length
a
bailer
terrifically
fast
but
just
off
the
wicket
desmond
snicks
it
between
short
slip
and
third
man
it
goes
to
the
boundary
that
what
cæsar
likes
says
the
duffer
he
can
cut
behind
the
wicket
till
the
cows
come
home
cut
and
come
again
says
the
caterpillar
the
fifth
ball
is
played
forward
for
a
risky
single
the
rev
septimus
forgets
that
times
have
changed
and
if
they
have
what
of
it
he
has
his
deep
vibrant
voice
rolls
across
the
lawn
right
up
to
the
batsman
steady
there
steady
and
now
the
has
to
take
the
last
ball
of
the
over
his
first
alas
and
alack
the
sixth
ball
is
dead
on
to
the
middle
stump
the
harrovian
plays
forward
man
alive
you
ought
to
have
played
back
to
that
the
ball
grazes
the
top
edge
of
the
bat
blade
and
flies
straight
into
the
welcoming
hands
of
the
two
wickets
for
breathless
suspense
broken
by
tumultuous
cheers
as
scaife
strides
on
to
the
ground
his
bat
is
under
his
arm
he
is
drawing
on
his
gloves
thousands
of
men
and
as
many
women
are
staring
at
his
splendid
face
and
figure
what
a
mover
murmurs
the
rev
septimus
scaife
strides
on
upon
his
face
is
the
expression
john
knows
so
well
and
fears
so
much
the
consciousness
of
power
the
stern
determination
to
be
first
to
shatter
previous
records
john
can
predict
and
does
so
with
absolute
certainty
what
will
happen
for
six
overs
the
demon
will
treat
every
ball
good
bad
and
indifferent
with
the
most
distinguished
consideration
and
then
when
his
eye
is
in
he
will
give
the
etonians
such
as
they
never
had
before
after
a
long
stand
made
by
scaife
and
desmond
cæsar
is
caught
at
but
scaife
remains
it
is
a
colossus
batting
not
a
harrow
boy
the
balls
come
down
the
pitch
the
demon
shoulders
and
chest
widen
the
great
knotted
arms
go
up
crash
first
singles
then
twos
then
threes
and
then
boundary
after
boundary
to
john
and
to
how
many
others
scaife
has
been
transformed
into
a
tremendous
human
machine
inexorably
cutting
and
slicing
pulling
and
driving
the
embodied
symbol
of
force
ruthlessly
applied
indefatigable
omnipotent
the
eton
captain
hopeful
against
odds
puts
on
a
cunning
and
cool
dealer
in
lobs
fluff
is
in
playing
steadily
holding
up
his
wicket
letting
the
giant
make
the
runs
the
etonian
delivers
his
first
ball
scaife
leaves
the
crease
fluff
sees
the
ball
slowly
spinning
harmless
enough
till
it
pitches
and
then
deadly
as
a
writhing
serpent
scaife
will
not
let
it
pitch
the
ball
curves
slightly
from
the
leg
to
the
off
scaife
is
facing
the
pavilion
a
stupendous
roar
bursts
from
the
crowd
the
ball
hit
with
terrific
force
sails
away
over
the
green
sward
over
the
ropes
over
the
heads
of
the
spectators
and
slap
on
to
the
top
of
the
pavilion
only
four
but
one
of
the
finest
swipes
ever
seen
at
lord
shade
of
mynn
come
forth
from
the
tomb
to
applaud
that
mighty
stroke
but
the
dealer
in
lobs
knows
that
the
man
who
leaves
his
citadel
leaves
it
sooner
or
later
not
to
return
in
the
hope
that
scaife
intoxicated
with
triumph
will
run
out
again
he
pitches
the
next
lob
too
much
up
a
scaife
smiles
john
prediction
has
been
fulfilled
a
record
has
been
established
never
before
in
an
eton
and
harrow
match
have
two
balls
been
hit
over
the
ropes
in
succession
the
crowds
have
lost
their
men
women
and
children
are
becoming
delirious
the
rev
septimus
throws
his
ancient
topper
into
the
air
the
caterpillar
splits
a
pair
of
delicate
grey
gloves
upon
the
tops
of
the
coaches
mothers
sisters
aunts
and
cousins
are
cheering
like
boys
the
harrow
first
innings
closed
with
runs
scaife
carrying
out
his
bat
for
an
almost
flawless
desmond
made
fluff
was
in
for
minutes
a
great
performance
for
him
and
was
caught
in
the
slips
after
compiling
a
useful
but
the
remarkable
feature
of
the
innings
was
the
short
time
in
which
so
many
runs
were
made
exactly
three
hours
the
elevens
went
in
to
lunch
as
the
crowd
poured
over
the
ground
laughing
and
chattering
this
is
a
delightful
hour
to
the
rev
septimus
he
will
walk
to
the
wickets
and
wait
there
for
his
innumerable
friends
it
will
be
hullo
sep
by
jove
here
dear
old
sep
sep
you
unfriendly
beast
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
us
sep
when
are
you
going
to
send
that
awful
tile
of
yours
to
the
british
museum
and
so
on
twenty
men
at
least
some
of
them
with
names
known
wherever
the
union
jack
waves
will
ask
the
rev
sep
to
lunch
with
them
but
the
rev
sep
will
say
as
he
has
said
these
thirty
years
that
he
does
come
to
lord
to
gorge
a
sandwich
presently
and
a
glass
of
fizz
if
you
please
but
time
is
precious
a
tall
bishop
strolls
up
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
church
an
eloquent
preacher
and
an
autocrat
in
his
diocese
most
people
regard
him
with
awe
the
rev
sep
greets
him
with
a
scandalous
slap
on
the
back
and
addresses
him
the
apostolic
one
as
lamper
and
the
lord
bishop
of
dudley
says
like
the
others
hullo
sep
we
used
to
think
you
a
slogger
but
you
never
came
anywhere
near
that
smite
of
scaife
i
thought
his
smite
was
coming
too
near
me
says
the
rev
sep
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
the
pavilion
lamper
old
chap
i
glad
to
see
your
again
and
so
they
stroll
off
together
mighty
prelate
and
humble
country
parson
once
again
happy
harrow
boys
and
now
before
eton
goes
in
we
must
climb
on
to
the
trent
coach
fluff
and
his
brother
cosmo
the
eton
bowler
are
lunching
in
other
company
but
we
shall
find
colonel
egerton
and
the
caterpillar
and
warde
so
the
hill
slightly
outnumbers
the
plain
as
the
duke
puts
it
next
to
the
duchess
sits
verney
the
duke
is
torn
nearly
in
two
between
his
desire
that
fluff
should
make
runs
and
that
cosmo
the
etonian
should
take
wickets
his
eton
sons
regard
him
as
a
traitor
a
rat
and
colonel
egerton
gravely
offers
him
the
out
of
his
coat
you
can
laugh
the
duke
says
seriously
but
when
i
see
what
harrow
has
done
for
esmé
i
almost
sorry
he
looks
at
his
youngest
son
nearly
but
not
quite
as
as
fluff
used
to
be
almost
sorry
that
i
did
send
alastair
there
also
alastair
smiles
contemptuously
if
you
had
he
says
i
should
have
never
spoken
to
you
again
esmé
is
a
forgiving
chap
but
you
wrecked
his
life
at
least
that
my
opinion
after
luncheon
the
crowd
on
the
lawn
thickens
the
ladies
want
to
see
the
pitch
and
shall
we
add
to
display
their
wonderful
frocks
the
enclosure
at
ascot
on
cup
day
is
not
so
gay
and
pretty
a
scene
as
this
the
caterpillar
sly
dog
has
secured
iris
warde
and
looks
uncommonly
pleased
with
himself
and
his
companion
a
smart
pair
but
smart
pairs
are
common
as
gooseberries
it
is
the
year
of
picture
hats
and
gainsborough
dresses
england
at
its
best
says
miss
iris
and
in
its
best
the
caterpillar
replies
solemnly
iris
warde
is
as
keen
as
her
father
daughter
ought
to
be
she
tells
the
caterpillar
that
when
she
was
a
small
girl
with
only
threepence
a
week
she
used
to
save
a
penny
a
week
for
twelve
weeks
preceding
the
match
so
as
to
be
able
to
put
a
shilling
into
the
plate
on
sunday
harrow
and
i
dare
say
you
marry
an
etonian
and
wear
light
blue
after
all
growls
the
caterpillar
never
says
miss
iris
now
amongst
the
black
coats
in
the
pavilion
you
see
a
white
figure
or
two
the
elevens
have
finished
lunch
and
are
mixing
with
the
crowd
scaife
is
talking
with
a
famous
old
carthusian
one
of
the
finest
living
exponents
of
cricket
sometime
an
international
at
football
and
a
the
great
man
is
very
cordial
for
he
sees
in
scaife
an
player
scaife
listens
smiling
obviously
he
is
impatient
to
begin
again
as
soon
as
possible
he
collects
his
men
and
leads
them
into
the
field
one
can
hear
the
policemen
saying
in
loud
firm
voices
pass
along
please
pass
along
as
if
by
magic
the
crowds
on
the
lawn
melt
away
in
a
few
minutes
the
etonians
come
out
of
the
pavilion
the
sun
shines
upon
their
caps
and
sashes
and
upon
faces
slightly
pale
also
but
not
yet
blue
for
eton
has
a
strong
batting
team
and
scaife
and
desmond
have
proved
that
it
is
a
batsman
wicket
and
now
the
connoisseurs
the
really
great
players
settle
themselves
down
comfortably
to
watch
scaife
field
that
to
them
is
the
great
attraction
apart
from
the
contest
between
the
rival
schools
some
of
these
olympians
have
been
heard
to
say
that
scaife
innings
against
weak
bowling
was
no
very
meritorious
performance
although
the
two
swipes
they
admit
were
parlous
knocks
still
public
school
cricket
is
kindergarten
cricket
and
if
you
not
been
at
eton
or
harrow
and
if
you
loathe
a
fashionable
crowd
and
if
you
think
fielding
is
worth
coming
to
lord
to
see
why
then
my
dear
fellow
look
at
scaife
scaife
stands
at
if
you
put
up
your
binoculars
you
will
see
that
he
is
almost
on
his
toes
his
heels
are
not
touching
the
ground
and
he
bends
slightly
not
quite
as
low
as
a
sprinter
but
so
low
that
he
can
start
with
amazing
speed
for
two
overs
not
a
ball
worth
fielding
rolls
his
way
ah
that
will
be
punished
a
long
hop
comes
down
the
pitch
the
etonian
squares
his
shoulders
his
eye
to
be
sure
is
on
the
ball
but
in
his
mind
eye
is
the
boundary
in
his
ear
the
first
burst
of
applause
bat
meets
ball
with
a
smack
which
echoes
from
the
tennis
court
to
the
stands
across
the
ground
now
watch
scaife
he
dashes
at
top
speed
for
the
only
point
where
his
hands
may
intercept
that
ball
and
by
heaven
he
stops
it
and
flicks
it
up
to
the
who
whips
off
the
bails
how
that
not
out
well
fielded
well
fielded
sir
a
very
close
squeak
says
the
caterpillar
they
wo
steal
many
runs
from
the
demon
sometimes
says
iris
warde
i
really
think
that
he
a
demon
the
caterpillar
nods
you
more
than
half
right
miss
warde
presently
the
first
wicket
falls
then
the
second
soon
after
and
the
score
is
under
twenty
the
rev
septimus
is
beaming
the
bishop
seated
beside
him
looks
as
if
he
were
about
to
pronounce
a
benediction
charles
desmond
is
scintillating
with
wit
and
good
humour
visions
of
a
single
innings
victory
engross
the
minds
of
these
three
they
are
in
the
front
row
of
the
pavilion
and
they
mean
to
see
every
ball
of
the
game
but
soon
it
becomes
evident
that
a
determined
stand
is
being
made
runs
come
slowly
but
they
come
the
score
creeps
up
thirty
forty
fifty
fluff
goes
on
to
bowl
on
his
day
fluff
is
tricky
but
this
apparently
is
not
his
day
the
runs
come
more
quickly
the
rev
septimus
removes
his
hat
wipes
his
forehead
and
replaces
his
hat
it
is
on
the
back
of
his
head
but
he
is
unaware
of
that
the
bishop
appears
now
as
if
he
were
reading
a
new
commination
to
wit
cursed
is
he
that
smiteth
his
neighbour
cursed
is
he
that
bowleth
half
volleys
the
minister
is
frowning
things
may
look
black
in
south
africa
but
they
looking
blacker
in
john
wood
one
hundred
runs
for
two
wickets
the
eton
cheers
are
becoming
exasperating
a
few
seats
away
warde
is
twiddling
his
thumbs
and
biting
his
lips
old
lord
fawley
has
slipped
into
the
pavilion
for
a
brandy
and
soda
at
last
scaife
takes
off
fluff
and
puts
on
a
fast
bowler
changing
his
own
place
in
the
field
to
short
slip
the
ball
a
first
ball
and
very
fast
puzzles
the
batsman
accustomed
to
slows
he
mistimes
it
it
grazes
the
edge
of
his
bat
and
whizzes
off
far
to
the
right
of
scaife
but
the
demon
has
it
somehow
or
other
ask
of
the
spirits
of
the
air
not
of
the
writer
somehow
his
wonderful
right
hand
has
met
and
held
the
ball
well
caught
sir
well
caught
that
boy
ought
to
be
knighted
on
the
spot
says
charles
desmond
then
the
three
generously
applaud
the
retiring
batsman
he
has
played
a
brilliant
innings
and
restored
the
confidence
of
all
etonians
the
eton
captain
descends
the
steps
a
veteran
this
not
a
dashing
player
but
sure
patient
and
full
of
grit
he
asks
the
umpire
to
give
him
middle
and
leg
then
he
notes
the
positions
of
the
field
d
n
it
ejaculates
charles
desmond
bishop
and
parson
regard
him
with
gratitude
there
are
times
when
an
honest
oath
becomes
expedient
the
eton
captain
has
cut
the
first
ball
into
fluff
hands
and
fluff
has
dropped
it
alastair
kinloch
from
the
top
of
the
trent
coach
screams
out
jolly
well
muffed
the
great
minister
silently
thanks
heaven
that
point
is
the
duke
son
and
not
his
and
of
course
the
eton
captain
never
gives
another
chance
till
he
is
dismissed
with
half
a
century
to
his
credit
meantime
five
more
wickets
have
fallen
seven
down
for
eton
leaves
the
field
with
a
score
of
against
harrow
harrow
goes
in
without
delay
and
one
wicket
is
taken
for
runs
before
the
stumps
are
drawn
charles
desmond
looks
at
the
sky
looks
like
rain
he
says
anxiously
and
so
ends
friday
play
the
morrow
dawned
grey
obscured
by
mist
rising
from
ground
soaked
by
two
hours
heavy
rain
you
may
be
sure
that
all
our
friends
were
early
at
lord
and
that
the
pitch
was
examined
by
thousands
of
anxious
eyes
the
eton
fast
bowler
was
seen
to
smile
upon
a
similar
wicket
had
he
not
done
the
famous
only
three
weeks
before
the
rain
however
was
over
and
soon
the
sun
would
drive
away
the
filmy
mists
no
man
alive
could
foretell
what
condition
the
pitch
would
be
in
after
a
few
hours
of
blazing
sunshine
the
rev
septimus
told
charles
desmond
that
he
considered
the
situation
to
be
critical
and
although
he
had
read
the
morning
paper
he
was
not
alluding
even
indirectly
to
south
african
affairs
charles
desmond
said
that
other
things
being
equal
the
hill
would
triumph
but
he
admitted
that
other
things
were
very
far
from
equal
it
looked
as
if
harrow
would
have
to
bat
upon
a
treacherous
wicket
and
eton
on
a
sound
one
at
ten
punctually
the
men
were
in
the
field
scaife
issued
last
instructions
block
the
bowling
do
try
to
score
till
you
see
what
tricks
the
ground
will
play
a
minute
saved
now
may
mean
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
us
later
cæsar
nodded
cheerfully
the
fact
that
the
luck
had
changed
stimulated
every
fibre
of
his
being
and
he
said
that
he
felt
in
his
bones
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
famous
match
like
that
of
something
never
to
be
forgotten
charles
desmond
spoke
few
words
while
his
son
was
batting
it
was
a
tradition
among
the
desmonds
that
they
rose
superior
to
emergency
the
minister
wondered
whether
his
harry
would
rise
or
fall
the
fast
bowler
delivered
the
first
ball
it
bumped
horribly
the
rev
septimus
shuddered
and
closed
his
eyes
cæsar
got
well
over
it
the
third
ball
was
cut
for
three
the
fourth
whizzed
down
a
wide
the
fast
bowler
dipped
the
ball
into
the
sawdust
it
is
all
jam
for
him
whispered
the
rev
septimus
well
bowled
well
bowled
alas
the
middle
stump
was
knocked
clean
out
of
the
ground
partner
a
steady
careful
player
had
been
bowled
by
his
first
ball
two
wickets
for
the
crowd
were
expecting
the
hero
but
fluff
was
walking
towards
the
wickets
wondering
whether
he
should
reach
them
alive
never
had
his
heart
beat
as
at
this
moment
scaife
had
come
up
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
examined
the
pitch
fluff
i
am
putting
you
in
early
because
you
are
a
fellow
i
can
trust
my
first
and
last
word
is
hit
at
nothing
that
is
wide
of
the
wicket
the
ground
will
probably
improve
fast
fluff
nodded
a
hive
of
bees
seemed
to
have
lodged
in
his
head
and
an
active
automatic
hammer
in
his
heart
but
he
did
dare
tell
the
demon
that
funk
abject
funk
possessed
him
body
and
soul
the
second
bowler
began
his
first
over
he
bowled
slows
desmond
played
the
six
balls
back
along
the
ground
a
maiden
over
and
then
that
muscular
beast
for
so
fluff
regarded
him
stared
fixedly
at
fluff
middle
stump
fluff
glanced
round
the
had
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips
for
his
billet
was
no
easy
one
cosmo
kinloch
at
short
slip
looked
as
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
that
fluff
would
put
the
ball
into
his
hands
then
fluff
faced
the
bowler
now
for
it
the
first
ball
was
half
a
foot
off
the
wicket
but
fluff
let
it
go
by
the
second
came
true
enough
fluff
blocked
it
the
third
flew
past
fluff
leg
but
he
just
snicked
it
desmond
started
to
run
and
then
stopped
holding
up
his
hand
cheers
rippled
round
the
ring
for
the
first
hit
to
the
boundary
that
was
a
bit
of
sheer
luck
fluff
reflected
after
this
both
boys
played
steadily
for
some
ten
minutes
then
very
slowly
cæsar
began
to
score
he
had
made
about
fifteen
when
he
drove
a
ball
hard
to
the
on
fluff
backing
up
desmond
watching
the
travelling
ball
called
to
him
to
run
it
seemed
to
desmond
almost
certain
that
the
ball
would
go
to
the
boundary
too
late
he
realized
that
it
had
been
magnificently
fielded
desmond
strained
every
nerve
but
his
bat
had
not
reached
the
crease
when
the
bails
flew
to
right
and
left
out
and
run
out
three
wickets
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
fluff
was
bowled
with
a
yorker
he
had
made
eleven
runs
and
kept
up
his
wicket
during
a
crisis
harrow
cheered
him
loudly
and
then
came
the
terrible
moment
of
the
morning
scaife
went
in
when
fluff
wicket
fell
the
ground
had
improved
but
it
was
still
treacherous
the
fast
bowler
sent
down
a
straight
one
it
shot
under
scaife
bat
and
his
stumps
the
knows
what
the
harrow
captain
said
but
it
does
not
bear
repeating
every
eye
was
on
his
scowling
furious
face
as
he
returned
to
the
pavilion
and
the
rev
septimus
scowled
also
because
he
had
always
maintained
that
any
harrovian
could
accept
defeat
like
a
gentleman
upon
the
other
side
of
the
ground
the
caterpillar
was
saying
to
his
father
i
always
said
he
was
hairy
at
the
heel
it
was
admitted
afterwards
that
the
duffer
performance
was
the
one
really
bright
spot
in
harrow
second
innings
being
a
bowler
he
went
in
last
but
one
it
happened
that
fluff
brother
was
in
possession
of
the
ball
it
will
never
be
known
why
the
duffer
chose
to
treat
cosmo
kinloch
balk
with
utter
scorn
and
contempt
the
duffer
was
tall
strong
and
a
terrific
slogger
nobody
expected
him
to
make
a
run
but
he
made
twenty
in
one
over
all
boundary
hits
when
he
left
the
wicket
he
had
added
to
the
score
and
would
have
changed
places
with
an
emperor
the
rev
septimus
followed
him
into
the
room
where
the
players
change
my
dear
boy
he
said
i
never
been
able
to
give
you
a
gold
watch
but
you
must
take
mine
here
it
is
and
and
god
bless
you
but
the
duffer
swore
stoutly
that
he
preferred
his
own
waterbury
eton
went
in
to
make
runs
in
four
hours
upon
a
wicket
almost
as
sound
as
it
had
been
upon
the
friday
scaife
put
the
duffer
on
to
bowl
the
demon
had
belief
in
luck
it
your
day
duffer
he
said
pitch
up
the
duffer
to
his
sire
exuberant
satisfaction
pitched
up
so
successfully
that
he
took
four
wickets
for
four
out
of
five
the
other
bowlers
however
being
not
so
successful
eton
accumulated
a
hundred
runs
the
captains
had
agreed
to
draw
stumps
at
to
win
therefore
the
plain
must
make
another
hundred
in
two
hours
and
three
of
their
crack
batsmen
were
out
after
tea
an
amazing
change
took
place
in
the
temper
of
the
spectators
conviction
seized
them
that
the
finish
was
likely
to
be
close
and
thrilling
that
the
one
thing
worth
undivided
attention
was
taking
place
in
the
middle
of
the
ground
as
the
minutes
passed
a
curious
silence
fell
upon
the
crowd
broken
only
by
the
cheers
of
the
rival
schools
the
boys
old
and
young
alike
were
watching
every
ball
every
stroke
the
eton
captain
was
still
in
playing
steadily
not
brilliantly
the
harrow
bowling
was
getting
slack
in
the
pavilion
the
rev
septimus
warde
and
charles
desmond
were
sitting
together
not
far
from
them
was
scaife
father
a
big
burly
man
with
a
square
head
and
heavy
features
he
had
never
been
a
cricketer
but
this
game
gripped
him
he
sat
next
to
a
financier
of
the
great
house
of
neuchatel
whose
sons
had
been
sent
to
the
hill
run
after
run
run
after
run
was
added
to
the
score
scaife
father
turned
to
neuchatel
i
write
a
cheque
for
ten
thousand
pounds
he
said
if
we
could
win
lionel
neuchatel
nodded
yes
he
muttered
i
have
not
felt
so
excited
since
sir
bevis
won
the
derby
in
the
deep
field
desmond
was
standing
miserable
because
he
had
nothing
to
do
no
balls
came
his
way
for
the
eton
captain
had
made
up
his
mind
to
win
this
match
with
singles
and
twos
very
carefully
he
placed
his
balls
between
the
fielders
very
carefully
his
partner
followed
his
chief
example
no
stealing
of
runs
no
scoring
off
straight
balls
no
gallery
play
till
victory
was
assured
poor
lord
fawley
retired
at
this
point
into
an
inner
room
pulling
savagely
at
his
white
beard
old
lyburn
who
had
been
sitting
beside
him
gurgling
and
gasping
staggered
after
him
the
rev
septimus
kept
wiping
his
forehead
i
ca
stand
this
much
longer
said
warde
in
a
hoarse
whisper
well
hit
sir
well
hit
the
eton
cheering
became
frantic
after
nearly
an
hour
pawky
uninteresting
play
the
eton
captain
suddenly
changed
his
tactics
his
eye
was
in
now
or
never
let
him
score
a
came
down
from
the
pavilion
end
a
and
off
the
wicket
the
etonian
put
all
the
strength
and
power
he
had
suppressed
so
manfully
into
a
tremendous
swipe
and
hit
the
ball
clean
over
the
ropes
do
you
want
to
double
that
bet
said
strathpeffer
to
the
caterpillar
they
were
standing
on
the
top
of
the
trent
coach
no
thanks
give
you
two
to
one
egerton
done
in
fivers
the
unhappy
bowler
sent
down
another
once
more
the
etonian
smote
and
smote
hard
but
this
ball
was
not
quite
the
same
as
the
first
although
it
appeared
identical
the
ball
soared
up
and
up
would
it
fall
over
the
ropes
thousands
of
eyes
watched
its
flight
desmond
started
to
run
golconda
to
a
sixpence
on
the
fall
it
is
falling
falling
falling
he
never
get
there
in
time
says
charles
desmond
yes
he
will
warde
answers
savagely
he
has
screamed
the
rev
septimus
he
pandemonium
broke
loose
men
threw
their
hats
into
the
air
danced
lovely
women
shrieked
every
harrovian
on
the
ground
howled
for
cæsar
held
the
ball
fast
in
his
lean
brown
hands
the
eton
captain
walks
slowly
towards
the
pavilion
he
had
to
pass
cæsar
on
his
way
and
passing
him
he
pauses
that
was
a
glorious
catch
he
says
with
the
smile
of
a
gallant
gentleman
and
as
harrow
as
cordially
as
eton
cheers
the
retiring
chieftain
the
caterpillar
whispers
to
verney
did
you
see
that
did
you
see
him
stop
to
congratulate
cæsar
yes
says
verney
i
hope
scaife
saw
it
too
the
caterpillar
replies
coolly
that
eton
captain
is
cut
out
of
whole
cloth
no
shoddy
there
by
jove
and
desmond
how
does
desmond
feel
it
is
futile
to
ask
him
because
he
could
not
tell
you
if
he
tried
but
we
can
answer
the
question
if
the
country
that
he
wishes
to
serve
crowns
him
with
all
the
honours
bestowed
upon
a
favoured
son
never
will
cæsar
desmond
know
again
a
moment
of
such
exquisite
unadulterated
joy
as
this
six
wickets
down
and
runs
to
get
in
less
than
half
an
hour
every
ball
now
every
stroke
is
a
matter
for
cheers
derisive
or
otherwise
the
rev
septimus
need
not
prate
of
golden
days
gone
by
boys
at
heart
never
change
and
the
atmosphere
is
so
charged
with
electricity
that
a
spark
sets
the
firmament
ablaze
wickets
for
wickets
for
signs
of
demoralization
show
themselves
on
both
sides
the
bowling
has
become
deplorably
feeble
the
batting
even
more
so
four
more
singles
are
recorded
only
ten
runs
remain
to
be
made
with
two
wickets
to
fall
and
twelve
minutes
to
play
scaife
puts
on
the
duffer
again
the
lips
of
the
rev
sep
are
seen
to
move
inaudibly
is
he
praying
or
cursing
because
three
singles
are
scored
off
his
son
first
three
balls
well
bowled
well
bowled
a
ball
of
fair
length
easy
enough
to
play
under
all
ordinary
circumstances
but
a
teaser
when
tremendous
issues
are
at
stake
has
defeated
one
of
the
etonians
the
last
man
runs
towards
the
pitch
through
a
perfect
hurricane
of
howls
warde
rises
i
ca
stand
it
he
says
and
his
voice
shakes
oddly
you
fellows
will
find
me
behind
the
pavvy
after
the
match
i
go
with
you
says
the
rev
septimus
in
a
choked
tone
but
if
i
tried
to
walk
i
should
tumble
down
charles
desmond
says
nothing
but
pray
note
the
expression
so
faithfully
recorded
in
the
compressed
lips
the
stern
frowning
brows
the
protruded
jaw
the
famous
debater
sees
all
fights
to
a
finish
and
fights
himself
till
he
drops
runs
to
make
one
wicket
to
fall
and
five
minutes
to
play
evidently
the
last
man
in
has
received
strenuous
instructions
from
his
chief
the
bowling
has
degenerated
into
that
of
anæmic
girls
and
two
whacks
to
the
boundary
mean
victory
the
is
the
square
fast
bowler
the
worst
bat
in
the
eleven
but
a
fellow
of
determination
a
slogger
and
a
against
village
teams
he
obeys
instructions
to
the
letter
the
duffer
fifth
ball
goes
to
the
boundary
three
runs
to
make
and
two
and
a
half
minutes
to
play
the
duffer
sends
down
the
last
ball
the
rev
septimus
covers
his
eyes
o
wretched
duffer
o
thou
whose
knees
are
as
wax
and
whose
arms
are
as
in
the
hands
of
a
griffin
o
egregious
duff
o
degenerate
son
of
a
noble
sire
dost
thou
dare
at
such
a
moment
as
this
to
attack
thine
enemy
with
a
long
hop
the
square
bowler
shows
his
teeth
as
the
ball
pitches
short
then
he
smites
and
runs
runs
because
he
has
smitten
so
hard
that
no
hand
surely
can
stop
the
whirling
sphere
runs
ay
and
so
does
the
demon
at
cover
point
this
is
the
demon
amazing
what
else
can
you
call
it
and
he
has
practised
it
so
often
that
he
reckons
failure
to
be
almost
impossible
to
those
watching
he
seems
to
spring
like
a
tiger
at
the
ball
by
heaven
he
has
stopped
it
he
snapped
it
up
but
if
he
despatches
it
to
the
it
will
arrive
too
late
the
other
etonian
is
already
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
crease
scaife
does
not
hesitate
he
aims
at
the
bowler
wicket
towards
which
the
burly
one
is
running
as
fast
as
legs
a
thought
too
short
can
carry
him
he
aims
and
shies
instantaneously
he
shatters
the
wicket
how
that
the
appeal
comes
from
every
part
of
the
ground
and
then
clearly
and
unmistakably
the
umpire
fiat
is
spoken
out
the
rev
sep
rises
and
rushes
off
upsetting
chairs
treading
on
toes
bent
only
upon
being

first
to
tell

the
cheering
at
bill
upon
the
following
tuesday
must
be
recorded
inasmuch
as
it
has
indirectly
bearing
upon
our
story
it
will
be
guessed
that
the
enthusiasm
the
uproar
the
tumultuous
excitement
were
even
greater
than
on
a
similar
occasion
some
fifteen
years
before
but
to
his
amazement
desmond
not
scaife
was
made
the
particular
hero
of
the
hour
scaife
display
of
temper
festered
in
the
hearts
of
boys
who
can
forgive
anything
sooner
than
low
breeding
the
hill
had
seen
the
etonian
stop
to
speak
his
cheery
word
of
congratulation
to
cæsar
and
not
the
caterpillar
alone
but
urchins
of
thirteen
had
made
comparisons
scaife
however
could
not
complain
of
his
reception
upon
that
memorable
tuesday
afternoon
the
cheering
must
have
been
heard
a
mile
away
but
desmond
was
acclaimed
differently
the
cheers
were
no
louder
that
was
impossible
but
afterwards
when
the
excitement
had
simmered
down
cæsar
became
the
object
of
a
special
demonstration
by
the
monitors
and
sixth
form
nearly
every
boy
of
note
in
the
upper
school
insisted
upon
shaking
his
hand
or
patting
him
on
the
back
scaife
came
up
with
the
others
but
he
left
the
yard
almost
immediately
and
retired
to
his
room
he
had
won
the
great
match
desmond
had
saved
it
and
the
school
apprehended
the
subtle
difference
more
scaife
knew
that
john
had
gone
up
to
desmond
with
outstretched
hands
after
the
match
at
lord
he
could
hear
eager
voice
see
the
flame
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
oh
cæsar
i
am
glad
it
was
you
who
made
that
catch
and
with
those
generous
words
with
that
warm
clasp
of
the
hand
scaife
had
seen
the
barrier
which
he
had
built
between
the
friends
dissolve
like
ice
in
the
the
attention
of
the
manor
was
now
fixed
upon
the
house
matches
it
seemed
probable
that
with
four
members
of
the
school
eleven
in
the
team
the
ancient
house
must
prove
invincible
but
to
john
surprise
as
this
delightful
probability
ripened
into
conviction
warde
betrayed
unwonted
anxiety
and
even
irritability
miss
iris
confided
to
desmond
who
paid
her
much
court
that
she
could
imagine
what
was
the
matter
with
papa
and
mamma
it
transpired
from
the
same
source
really
feared
that
the
strain
at
lord
had
been
too
much
that
her
indefatigable
husband
was
about
to
break
down
finally
john
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
a
question
he
was
second
in
command
he
had
a
right
to
ask
the
chief
if
anything
were
seriously
amiss
accordingly
he
waited
upon
warde
after
prayers
but
when
he
put
his
question
and
expressed
modestly
enough
his
anxiety
and
desire
to
help
if
he
could
warde
bit
his
lips
then
he
burst
out
violently
i
am
miserable
verney
john
said
nothing
his
tutor
rose
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
study
then
halting
facing
john
he
spoke
quickly
with
restless
gestures
indicating
volcanic
disturbance
i
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
he
said
as
many
a
better
man
has
been
before
me
i
thought
i
wiped
out
the
grosser
evils
in
the
manor
but
i
have
i
have
do
you
know
that
a
fellow
in
this
house
perhaps
two
of
but
one
at
any
rate
is
getting
out
at
night
and
going
up
to
town
you
need
answer
verney
if
you
do
know
it
you
are
powerless
to
prevent
it
or
it
would
occur
thank
you
sir
i
can
only
guess
who
it
is
i
am
not
certain
and
to
make
certain
i
must
play
the
spy
creep
and
crawl
do
what
i
loathe
to
do
suspect
the
innocent
together
with
the
guilty
it
almost
breaking
my
heart
i
can
understand
that
sir
after
what
you
have
done
for
us
warde
smiled
grimly
i
do
think
you
do
quite
understand
he
said
slowly
at
this
moment
i
am
tempted
tempted
as
i
never
have
been
tempted
to
let
things
slide
to
shut
both
eyes
and
ears
till
this
term
is
over
next
term
he
laughed
harshly
i
sha
stand
in
such
an
awkward
place
the
deep
sea
will
always
be
near
me
but
the
devil
the
devil
will
be
elsewhere
john
nodded
his
serious
face
expressed
neither
approval
nor
disapproval
to
the
man
keenly
watching
it
afterwards
warde
remembered
this
impassivity
if
i
do
not
act
warde
voice
trembled
i
am
damned
as
a
traitor
in
my
own
eyes
john
had
never
doubted
that
his
would
act
as
for
creeping
and
crawling
can
peaks
be
scaled
without
creeping
and
crawling
never
you
are
not
to
speak
a
word
of
warning
warde
continued
vehemently
if
you
know
what
i
do
know
yet
still
you
can
not
speak
to
me
because
the
sinner
in
this
case
is
a
boy
you
can
not
speak
to
me
and
you
will
not
speak
to
him
on
your
honour
there
was
interrogation
in
the
last
sentence
john
replied
almost
inaudibly
i
shall
not
speak
on
my
honour
it
is
hard
hard
indeed
that
i
should
have
to
foul
my
own
nest
but
it
must
be
so
good
night
john
went
back
to
his
room
calm
without
terribly
agitated
within
what
ruthless
spirit
had
driven
him
to
warde
study
yes
at
last
inexorably
discovery
disgrace
the
ineffaceable
brand
of
expulsion
impended
over
the
head
of
his
enemy
to
whom
he
was
pledged
to
utter
no
word
of
warning
like
warde
he
did
not
know
absolutely
but
he
guessed
that
scaife
had
spent
another
riotous
night
in
town
since
the
match
he
had
read
it
in
the
eyes
glittering
with
excitement
in
the
derisive
smile
of
conscious
power
in
the
magnetic
audacity
of
scaife
glance
and
then
he
remembered
lawrence
parting
words
it
will
be
a
fight
to
a
finish
and
mark
me
warde
will
win
two
wretched
days
and
nights
passed
more
than
once
john
spurred
himself
to
the
point
of
going
to
warde
and
saying
think
what
you
like
of
me
i
am
going
to
warn
the
boy
i
loathe
that
you
are
at
his
heels
still
always
at
the
last
moment
he
did
not
go
some
power
seemed
to
restrain
him
but
when
he
tried
to
analyse
his
feelings
he
confessed
himself
muddled
he
had
obtained
nay
invited
warde
confidence
and
he
dared
not
abuse
it
it
was
a
time
of
anguish
he
was
unable
to
concentrate
his
mind
upon
work
or
play
deprived
of
sleep
haunted
by
the
conviction
that
if
desmond
knew
all
he
would
turn
from
him
for
ever
then
at
the
most
difficult
moment
of
his
life
the
way
of
escape
was
opened
since
the
match
john
and
cæsar
had
resumed
the
former
unrestrained
and
continual
intimacy
and
intercourse
john
was
in
and
out
of
room
desmond
was
in
and
out
of
john
room
at
all
hours
they
found
together
of
course
but
it
is
not
fortunately
at
meals
that
boys
or
men
discuss
the
things
nearest
to
their
hearts
but
at
night
just
before
lights
were
turned
out
or
just
after
when
an
olympian
is
privileged
to
work
a
little
longer
by
the
light
of
the
useful
tolly
cæsar
and
jonathan
would
talk
freely
of
past
present
and
future
it
was
during
these
minutes
or
on
sunday
afternoons
that
john
would
read
to
his
friend
the
essays
or
verses
which
always
fired
desmond
admiration
and
enthusiasm
to
john
intellectual
activities
cæsar
played
so
to
speak
gallery
even
as
john
upon
many
an
afternoon
had
sat
stewing
in
the
covered
applauding
service
into
the
corner
or
his
hot
returns
just
above
the
line
at
home
in
the
holidays
the
boys
had
always
met
upon
the
same
plane
of
the
two
john
was
the
better
rider
and
shot
both
were
members
of
the
philathletic
club
of
harrow
and
the
fact
that
desmond
was
incomparably
his
superior
as
an
athlete
was
counterbalanced
by
fine
intellectual
attainments
if
john
at
times
wished
that
he
could
cut
behind
the
wicket
in
cæsar
faultless
style
desmond
on
the
other
hand
spoke
enviously
of
the
medal
or
the
essay
or
some
other
of
john
successes
john
spoke
often
and
well
in
the
debating
society
getting
up
his
subjects
with
intelligence
and
care
so
it
was
between
them
and
this
adjusted
the
balance
of
their
friendship
and
without
this
no
friendship
can
be
pronounced
perfect
none
the
less
free
and
delightful
as
this
resumption
of
the
old
intimacy
had
been
john
knew
cæsar
too
well
not
to
perceive
that
between
them
lay
an
unmentionable
five
weeks
during
which
something
had
occurred
from
signs
only
too
well
interpreted
before
john
guessed
that
cæsar
was
once
more
in
debt
to
the
demon
and
finally
cæsar
confessed
that
he
had
been
betting
that
he
had
won
following
scaife
advice
and
then
had
lost
the
loss
was
greater
than
the
gain
and
the
difference
some
five
and
twenty
pounds
had
been
sent
to
bookmaker
by
scaife
as
before
scaife
ridiculed
the
possibility
of
such
a
debt
causing
his
pal
any
uneasiness
but
it
chafed
desmond
consumedly
upon
the
saturday
of
the
house
match
in
which
the
manor
had
won
a
great
victory
by
an
innings
and
runs
john
went
to
desmond
room
after
prayers
he
noticed
at
once
that
his
friend
was
unusually
excited
john
however
attributed
this
to
cæsar
big
score
success
always
inflamed
cæsar
just
as
it
seemed
to
tranquillize
john
john
began
to
talk
but
he
noticed
that
cæsar
was
abstracted
answered
in
monosyllables
and
twice
looked
at
his
watch
have
you
an
appointment
cæsar
no
what
were
you
saying
jonathan
you
look
rather
queer
do
i
he
laughed
nervously
you
not
bothering
over
that
debt
this
time
cæsar
laughed
naturally
rather
not
why
that
debt
he
stopped
is
it
paid
said
john
it
will
be
do
worry
but
john
looked
worried
he
perceived
that
cæsar
hands
were
trembling
whenever
they
were
still
harry
said
he
he
never
called
desmond
harry
except
when
they
were
at
home
harry
what
wrong
why
nothing
nothing
that
is
which
amounts
to
anything
harry
you
are
the
worst
liar
in
england
something
is
wrong
ca
you
tell
me
you
must
i
hanged
if
i
leave
you
till
you
do
tell
me
he
looked
steadily
at
desmond
in
his
clear
grey
eyes
were
tiny
dancing
flecks
of
golden
brown
which
desmond
had
seen
once
or
twice
before
which
came
whenever
john
was
profoundly
moved
the
dancing
flecks
transformed
themselves
in
desmond
fancy
into
sprites
the
airy
creatures
of
john
will
imposing
john
wishes
and
commands
scaife
said
i
might
tell
you
if
i
liked
scaife
john
drew
in
his
breath
then
scaife
wanted
you
to
tell
me
i
am
sure
of
that
he
felt
his
way
by
the
dim
light
of
smouldering
suspicion
if
scaife
wanted
john
to
know
anything
it
was
because
such
knowledge
must
prove
pain
not
pleasure
john
did
not
say
this
then
very
abruptly
desmond
continued
you
swear
that
what
i
about
to
tell
you
will
be
regarded
as
sacred
yes
it
is
a
matter
which
concerns
scaife
and
me
not
you
you
interfere
no
i
going
to
london
do
look
at
me
like
that
you
silly
old
ass
it
not
not
what
you
think
he
laughed
nervously
i
have
bet
scaife
pounds
the
amount
of
my
debt
in
fact
that
the
of
supper
at
the
carlton
hotel
will
be
handed
to
him
after
chapel
morning
i
bike
up
to
town
and
bike
back
if
i
do
go
this
saturday
i
have
one
more
chance
before
the
term
is
over
that
all
that
all
repeated
john
stupefied
if
you
can
show
me
an
easier
way
to
make
a
i
be
obliged
to
you
scaife
egged
you
on
to
this
piece
of
folly
no
he
did
you
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
bit
by
bit
john
extracted
the
facts
behind
them
of
course
stood
scaife
loving
evil
for
evil
sake
planting
evil
gleaning
evil
deliberately
setting
about
the
devil
work
desmond
it
appeared
had
persuaded
scaife
not
to
go
to
town
till
the
lord
match
was
over
since
the
match
scaife
had
spent
two
nights
in
london
whetting
an
inordinate
appetite
for
forbidden
fruit
exciting
in
desmond
also
not
an
appetite
for
the
fruit
itself
but
for
the
mad
excitement
of
a
perilous
adventure
then
when
the
thoughtless
i
like
a
lark
of
that
sort
had
been
spoken
came
the
derisive
answer
you
have
the
nerve
for
it
and
then
again
the
subtle
leading
of
an
ardent
and
nature
into
the
morass
scaife
pretending
to
dissuade
a
friend
entreating
him
to
consider
the
risk
urging
him
to
go
to
bed
as
if
he
were
a
headstrong
child
and
finally
desmond
challenge
bet
you
i
have
the
nerve
and
its
acceptance
protestingly
by
the
other
and
permission
given
that
john
should
be
told
and
it
i
mean
to
have
that
do
you
think
i
back
out
now
in
his
mind
eye
our
poor
john
was
gazing
down
a
long
lane
with
no
turning
at
the
end
of
it
could
he
make
his
friend
believe
that
scaife
had
brought
this
thing
to
pass
from
no
other
motive
than
wishing
to
hurt
mortally
an
enemy
by
the
hand
of
a
friend
no
never
would
such
an
ingenuous
youth
as
cæsar
accept
or
even
listen
to
such
an
abominable
explanation
good
night
said
john
i
see
you
rather
sick
with
me
jonathan
remember
you
made
me
speak
morning
we
have
a
good
laugh
over
it
we
walk
to
the
haunted
house
and
i
tell
my
tale
i
shall
be
on
my
way
in
less
than
an
hour
john
went
back
to
his
room
the
necessity
for
silence
and
thought
had
become
imperative
what
could
he
do
it
was
certain
that
warde
was
waiting
and
watching
he
had
inexhaustible
patience
desmond
not
the
demon
would
be
caught
and
expelled
john
returned
to
desmond
room
you
told
me
so
much
he
said
tell
me
a
little
more
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
to
do
what
get
out
of
the
house
get
a
bike
and
all
that
easy
lovell
went
out
that
way
and
others
you
jump
from
the
sill
of
the
first
landing
window
into
the
one
must
be
able
to
jump
of
course
but
i
can
jump
then
you
shin
down
the
tree
nip
through
the
shrubbery
and
over
the
locked
yes
john
said
slowly
over
the
gate
i
borrowed
a
bike
from
one
of
the
cycle
corps
and
have
ridden
it
in
the
garden
in
a
bush
to
the
right
of
the
gate
john
nodded
it
moonlight
after
ten
i
shall
enjoy
the
ride
immensely
you
will
try
to
get
back
into
the
house
at
night
too
dangerous
lovell
did
it
but
the
demon
marches
in
boldly
just
before
chapel
he
may
have
slipped
out
on
half
a
dozen
errands
as
soon
as
the
door
is
opened
in
the
morning
i
shall
sleep
under
a
stack
a
lovely
night
now
old
jonathan
i
hope
you
satisfied
that
i
not
either
the
fool
or
the
sinner
you
took
me
to
be
look
here
harry
if
i
appeal
to
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
if
i
ask
you
for
my
sake
and
for
my
mother
sake
not
to
do
this
thing
jonathan
i
must
go
do
make
it
harder
than
it
is
then
it
hard
i
wo
whine
about
that
i
courted
this
adventure
and
by
jove
going
to
see
it
through
the
odds
are
a
hundred
to
one
against
my
being
nailed
all
right
i
say
no
more
good
night
good
night
old
jonathan
john
went
back
to
his
room
waited
three
minutes
and
then
in
despair
made
up
his
mind
to
seek
scaife
he
felt
certain
that
the
extraordinary
luck
was
about
to
stand
between
him
and
expulsion
desmond
would
be
caught
but
not
he
john
ground
his
teeth
with
rage
at
the
thought
he
found
scaife
alone
at
work
on
cricketing
accounts
hullo
verney
cæsar
tells
me
that
he
is
going
up
to
london
oh
he
told
you
that
did
he
yes
you
wished
him
to
tell
me
perhaps
scaife
laughed
louder
you
want
to
prove
to
me
said
john
slowly
that
you
are
the
stronger
perhaps
scaife
laughed
well
if
i
surrender
if
i
admit
that
you
are
the
stronger
that
you
have
defeated
me
wo
that
be
enough
eh
i
do
quite
take
you
you
are
the
stronger
john
voice
was
very
miserable
i
have
tried
to
dissuade
him
as
you
knew
i
should
try
and
i
have
failed
is
that
enough
you
have
your
triumph
but
now
be
generous
turn
round
and
use
your
strength
the
other
way
make
him
give
up
this
folly
you
do
want
to
see
your
own
pal
sacked
precious
little
chance
of
that
there
is
the
chance
scaife
hesitated
did
some
worthier
impulse
stir
within
him
who
can
tell
his
keen
eye
softened
and
then
hardened
again
no
he
said
quickly
if
i
agree
to
what
you
propose
it
is
after
all
you
who
triumph
not
i
and
i
doubt
if
i
could
stop
him
now
even
if
i
tried
he
laughed
again
for
the
third
time
savagely
you
are
hoist
with
your
own
petard
verney
you
wanted
to
see
me
sacked
and
now
that
there
is
a
chance
in
a
thousand
that
cæsar
will
be
sacked
you
squirm
i
swore
to
get
my
knife
into
you
and
by
god
i
done
it
john
went
out
very
pale
he
passed
through
into
the
private
side
and
tapped
at
warde
study
door
warde
voice
bade
him
enter
she
looked
at
john
face
afterwards
she
testified
that
he
looked
singularly
cool
and
i
wish
to
see
warde
he
said
he
dining
at
the
head
master
will
he
be
in
soon
i
er
do
know
perhaps
not
i
would
wait
for
him
verney
if
i
were
you
thank
you
said
john
good
night
he
went
back
to
his
room
in
warde
eyes
he
had
read
what
excitement
apprehension
suddenly
conviction
came
to
him
that
this
dinner
at
the
head
master
was
a
blind
why
during
that
very
afternoon
warde
had
mentioned
casually
to
scaife
that
he
was
dining
out
he
had
deliberately
informed
the
demon
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
at
this
moment
probably
warde
lay
concealed
near
the
chestnut
tree
waiting
watching
about
to
pounce
upon
the
wrong
man
the
temptation
to
cry
tore
at
his
vitals
till
this
moment
the
tyranny
of
honour
had
never
oppressed
john
having
resolved
to
tell
warde
that
he
meant
to
break
his
word
it
may
seem
inexplicable
that
he
should
go
a
step
further
and
break
his
word
without
warning
the
upon
such
nice
points
of
conscience
hang
issues
of
importance
to
john
at
any
rate
the
difference
between
the
two
paths
out
of
a
tangled
wood
was
greater
than
it
might
appear
to
some
of
us
warde
had
trusted
him
implicitly
could
he
bring
himself
to
violate
warde
confidence
without
giving
the
man
notice
however
what
he
might
have
done
under
pressure
must
remain
a
matter
of
surmise
at
this
moment
a
third
path
became
visible
and
down
it
john
rushed
without
consideration
as
to
where
it
might
lead
the
one
thing
plain
at
this
crisis
was
the
certainty
that
he
had
discovered
a
plan
of
action
which
would
save
two
things
he
valued
supremely
his
friendship
for
cæsar
and
his
word
of
honour
here
we
are
to
liberty
to
speculate
what
john
would
have
done
had
he
considered
dispassionately
the
consequences
of
an
action
to
be
accomplished
at
once
or
not
at
all
but
he
had
not
time
to
consider
anything
except
the
fact
that
action
would
put
to
rout
some
very
tormenting
thoughts
he
crumpled
his
bed
disarranged
his
room
and
put
on
a
cap
and
a
thin
overcoat
as
all
lights
in
the
boys
side
of
the
manor
were
extinguished
then
he
stole
out
of
his
room
and
crept
to
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
a
moment
later
he
had
squeezed
through
it
and
was
standing
upon
the
sill
outside
gazing
fearfully
at
the
void
beneath
and
the
distance
between
the
sill
and
the
branch
in
front
of
him
afterwards
he
confessed
that
this
moment
was
the
most
difficult
he
was
an
active
boy
but
he
had
never
jumped
such
a
chasm
if
he
missed
the
bough
to
hesitate
meant
shameful
retreat
john
felt
the
sweat
break
upon
him
craven
fear
clutched
his
and
set
them
he
jumped
the
ease
with
which
he
caught
the
branch
was
such
a
physical
relief
that
he
almost
forgot
his
errand
he
slid
quietly
down
the
tree
pausing
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
it
the
moon
was
just
rising
above
the
horizon
but
under
the
trees
the
darkness
was
stygian
john
pushed
quietly
through
the
shrubberies
treading
as
lightly
as
possible
every
moment
he
expected
to
see
the
flash
of
a
lantern
to
hear
warde
voice
to
feel
an
arresting
hand
upon
the
shoulder
it
was
quite
impossible
to
guess
with
any
reasonable
accuracy
what
part
of
the
garden
warde
had
selected
for
a
very
soon
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
and
gazed
keenly
into
the
moonlit
meadow
below
him
peer
as
he
might
he
could
see
no
trace
of
warde
a
dozen
trees
might
conceal
him
perhaps
with
the
omniscience
of
the
he
had
divined
that
the
was
the
ultimate
place
of
egress
perhaps
the
wicket
had
been
used
for
a
similar
purpose
when
warde
himself
was
a
boy
at
the
manor
it
was
vital
to
john
plan
that
warde
should
see
him
without
recognizing
him
and
give
chase
the
chase
would
end
in
capture
at
some
point
as
reasonably
far
from
the
manor
as
possible
warde
might
ask
for
explanations
but
none
would
be
forthcoming
till
the
morrow
meantime
the
coast
would
be
clear
for
desmond
john
in
fine
was
playing
the
part
of
a
but
where
was
warde
the
question
answered
itself
within
a
minute
and
after
a
fashion
absolutely
unforeseen
as
john
was
crossing
from
the
shrubbery
to
the
wicket
he
looked
back
to
his
horror
he
saw
lights
in
the
boys
side
light
in
the
window
of
scaife
room
instantly
john
divined
what
had
come
to
pass
and
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
warde
from
some
coign
of
vantage
had
seen
a
boy
leave
his
house
why
should
he
try
to
arrest
the
boy
why
should
he
risk
the
humiliation
of
running
after
him
and
perhaps
failing
to
capture
him
no
no
men
forty
were
not
likely
to
work
in
that
boyish
fashion
warde
had
adopted
an
infinitely
better
plan
assured
that
a
boy
had
left
the
house
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
walk
round
the
rooms
and
find
out
which
one
was
absent
he
had
begun
with
scaife
next
to
scaife
was
the
room
belonging
to
the
head
of
the
house
then
came
john
room
and
then
cæsar
long
before
warde
reached
cæsar
room
cæsar
would
have
heard
him
cæsar
at
any
rate
was
saved
john
crept
back
under
cover
of
the
shrubberies
he
saw
the
light
flicker
out
of
scaife
window
and
shine
more
steadily
in
the
next
room
the
window
of
this
room
was
open
and
john
could
hear
the
voice
of
warde
and
the
head
of
the
house
john
waited
and
then
the
light
shone
in
desmond
room
john
crouched
against
the
wall
trembling
if
cæsar
had
not
heard
the
voices
if
he
were
fully
dressed
if
suddenly
he
caught
warde
reassuring
words
ah
desmond
sorry
to
disturb
you
good
night
john
waited
very
soon
scaife
would
come
to
desmond
room
ah
just
so
the
night
was
so
still
that
he
could
hear
quite
plainly
the
muffled
voices
what
up
warde
is
going
his
rounds
perhaps
he
smells
a
rat
and
then
whispers
john
strained
his
ears
only
a
word
or
two
more
reached
him
verney
d
d
interfering
sneak
let
see
it
was
scaife
who
was
speaking
john
heard
his
own
door
opened
and
shut
scaife
then
had
discovered
his
absence
and
naturally
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
warned
warde
let
him
think
so
the
boys
were
still
whispering
together
not
scaife
said
decisively
no
no
desmond
replied
john
wondered
what
remained
to
be
done
warde
of
course
would
satisfy
himself
that
no
boy
in
his
house
was
missing
except
john
before
he
pronounced
him
the
absentee
poor
warde
this
would
be
a
hard
knock
for
him
john
thoughts
were
jostling
each
other
freely
when
he
recalled
desmond
words
i
have
one
more
chance
before
the
term
is
over
he
had
wished
to
clear
the
way
for
his
friend
not
to
block
it
then
he
remembered
the
terms
of
the
bet
and
laughed
he
ran
back
to
the
wicket
found
the
bicycle
lit
the
lamp
and
hoisted
the
machine
over
the
gate
then
he
laughed
again
after
all
this
escaping
from
bondage
this
midnight
adventure
beneath
the
impending
sword
of
expulsion
thrilled
him
to
the
marrow
when
john
returned
on
sunday
to
the
manor
shortly
after
the
doors
were
unlocked
in
the
morning
he
found
dumbleton
awaiting
him
dumber
face
expressed
such
amazement
and
consternation
that
john
nearly
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
it
all
hup
sir
said
the
butler
only
in
moments
of
intense
excitement
did
dumber
misplace
or
leave
out
the
aspirate
you
to
come
with
me
at
once
to
warde
study
john
followed
the
butler
into
the
familiar
room
warde
was
not
down
yet
but
evidently
dumber
had
instructions
not
to
leave
the
prisoner
john
stared
at
the
then
he
turned
to
dumbleton
and
said
carelessly
this
means
the
sack
eh
dumber
yes
sir
could
you
do
it
sir
such
a
gentleman
too
thank
you
dumber
john
took
an
envelope
from
the
desk
and
wrote
scaife
name
upon
it
dumber
please
give
scaife
this
with
my
compliments
it
is
as
you
see
a
bill
of
fare
very
good
sir
john
placed
the
card
into
the
envelope
and
handed
both
to
dumbleton
with
my
compliments
certainly
sir
and
chapel
yes
sir
a
moment
later
warde
came
in
dumbleton
went
out
immediately
with
a
sorrowful
backward
glance
at
john
the
good
fellow
looked
terribly
bewildered
for
john
face
john
deportment
had
amazed
him
john
was
quite
unaware
of
it
but
he
looked
astonishingly
well
excitement
had
flushed
his
cheek
and
lent
a
sparkle
to
his
grey
eyes
he
had
enjoyed
his
ride
to
town
and
back
he
had
slept
soundly
under
the
lee
of
a
haystack
and
he
had
washed
his
face
and
hands
in
the
at
the
foot
of
sudbury
hill
and
the
certainty
that
desmond
was
safe
that
in
the
end
he
john
had
triumphed
over
scaife
filled
his
soul
with
joy
warde
on
the
other
hand
looked
wretched
he
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
he
was
pale
haggard
gaunt
what
have
you
to
say
verney
nothing
sir
nothing
warde
clenched
his
hands
and
burst
into
speech
letting
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
suppressed
escape
in
tumultuous
words
and
gestures
nothing
you
dare
to
stand
there
and
say
nothing
that
you
should
have
done
this
thing
why
it
incredible
and
i
who
trusted
you
and
you
listened
to
me
with
a
face
like
brass
laughing
in
your
sleeve
no
doubt
at
the
fool
who
betrayed
himself
and
you
came
here
so
my
wife
tells
me
to
see
if
i
was
out
of
the
way
if
the
coast
was
clear
and
you
were
cool
as
a
cucumber
oh
you
hypocrite
you
damnable
hypocrite
i
have
to
see
you
now
but
never
again
will
i
look
willingly
upon
your
face
never
well
this
wretched
business
must
be
ended
you
got
out
of
my
house
last
night
you
heard
i
was
dining
with
the
head
master
i
returned
early
and
i
saw
you
jump
from
the
passage
window
you
do
deny
that
you
went
up
to
london
i
suppose
no
sir
i
do
deny
it
at
the
moment
john
quite
unconsciously
looked
as
if
he
were
glorying
in
what
he
had
done
warde
could
have
struck
his
clean
clear
face
unblushingly
meeting
his
furious
glance
in
disgust
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
to
the
window
john
felt
rather
than
saw
that
his
tutor
was
profoundly
moved
when
he
turned
two
tears
were
trickling
down
his
cheeks
the
sight
of
them
nearly
undid
john
when
warde
spoke
again
his
voice
was
choked
by
his
emotion
verney
he
said
i
spoke
just
now
in
an
unrestrained
manner
because
you
you
his
voice
trembled
have
shaken
my
faith
in
all
i
hold
most
dear
i
say
to
you
i
say
to
you
that
i
believed
in
you
as
i
believe
in
my
wife
even
now
i
feel
that
somehow
there
is
a
mistake
that
you
are
not
what
you
confess
yourself
to
be
a
humbug
you
have
worked
as
i
have
worked
for
this
house
and
in
one
moment
you
undo
that
work
have
you
paused
to
think
what
effect
this
will
have
upon
the
others
not
yet
sir
john
looked
respectfully
sympathetic
poor
warde
this
was
rough
indeed
upon
him
suddenly
the
door
was
flung
open
and
desmond
burst
into
the
room
with
a
complete
disregard
of
the
customary
proprieties
and
rushed
up
to
warde
sir
he
said
vehemently
verney
did
this
to
save
warde
saw
the
slow
smile
break
upon
john
face
and
seeing
it
he
came
as
near
hysterical
laughter
as
a
man
of
his
character
and
temperament
can
come
he
perceived
that
john
for
some
amazing
reason
had
played
the
that
in
fact
he
was
innocent
not
a
humbug
not
a
hypocrite
not
a
sinner
and
the
relief
was
so
stupendous
that
the
tutor
flung
himself
back
into
a
chair
gasping
desmond
spoke
quietly
i
was
going
to
town
sir
for
the
first
time
i
swear
and
only
to
win
a
bet
and
for
the
excitement
of
jumping
out
of
a
window
john
tried
to
dissuade
me
when
he
exhausted
every
argument
he
went
himself
the
lord
be
praised
said
warde
he
had
divined
everything
but
he
let
desmond
tell
the
story
in
detail
scaife
name
was
left
out
of
the
narrative
then
warde
said
slowly
i
shall
not
refer
this
business
to
the
head
master
i
shall
deal
with
it
myself
for
your
own
sake
desmond
for
the
sake
of
your
father
and
above
all
else
for
the
sake
of
this
house
i
shall
do
no
more
than
ask
you
to
promise
that
for
the
rest
of
your
time
at
harrow
you
will
endeavour
to
atone
for
what
has
been
all
boys
worth
their
salt
are
creatures
of
reserves
let
us
respect
them
it
is
easy
to
surmise
what
passed
between
the
friends
the
gratitude
the
the
humiliation
on
one
side
the
sympathy
the
encouragement
and
shy
restrained
affection
on
the
other
a
moment
for
john
this
revealing
without
disguise
the
weakness
of
desmond
character
but
illuminating
the
triumph
over
scaife
the
john
had
been
inhuman
if
this
knowledge
had
not
been
as
spikenard
to
him
chapel
over
the
boys
came
pouring
back
into
the
house
in
a
minute
the
fags
would
be
hurrying
up
with
the
tea
and
the
asking
for
orders
in
a
minute
scaife
would
rush
in
with
questions
hot
upon
his
lips
john
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
heard
scaife
step
hullo
cæsar
why
did
you
cut
chapel
and
john
saw
that
the
carlton
was
in
his
hand
he
chuckled
again
dumber
has
just
given
me
did
you
go
after
all
he
asked
cæsar
they
had
not
met
since
warde
visit
of
the
night
before
i
did
go
said
cæsar
dumber
gave
it
to
me
with
verney
compliments
you
lost
your
bet
said
john
but
how
jonathan
went
to
town
instead
of
me
said
desmond
we
thought
he
was
with
warde
he
was
this
morning
early
i
found
out
that
he
slept
in
his
bed
i
saw
him
come
back
and
i
saw
dumber
waiting
for
him
when
dumber
came
out
of
warde
room
he
told
me
that
jonathan
had
been
up
to
town
and
was
going
to
be
sacked
he
blurted
out
the
rest
of
the
story
to
which
scaife
listened
attentively
when
desmond
finished
there
was
a
pause
you
devilish
clever
said
scaife
to
john
i
shall
pay
up
the
pony
said
desmond
no
you
wo
said
scaife
as
for
the
money
i
never
cared
a
hang
about
that
i
glad
and
you
ought
to
know
it
that
you
won
the
bet
all
the
same
verney
is
entitled
to
all
the
glory
that
you
give
him
he
is
he
is
and
more
too
scaife
laughed
john
felt
rather
uncomfortable
always
scaife
exhibited
his
amazing
resource
at
unexpected
moments
never
mind
scaife
continued
i
wo
burst
the
pretty
bubble
and
i
admit
remember
verney
cleverness
he
was
turning
to
go
but
desmond
clutched
his
sleeve
when
he
spoke
his
fair
face
was
scarlet
you
sneer
at
the
wrong
man
and
at
the
wrong
time
he
said
angrily
and
you
talk
as
though
i
was
a
fool
well
i
am
a
fool
perhaps
and
i
blow
bubbles
prick
this
one
if
you
can
i
challenge
you
to
do
it
scaife
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
so
obvious
he
said
coolly
that
your
kind
friend
ran
no
risks
other
than
a
sprained
ankle
or
a
cold
what
do
you
mean
he
was
certain
that
you
would
come
forward
he
forced
your
hand
there
was
never
the
smallest
chance
of
his
being
sacked
and
he
knew
it
yes
said
john
calmly
i
knew
it
just
so
said
scaife
he
went
out
whistling
desmond
had
time
to
whisper
to
john
before
the
fags
called
them
to
breakfast
in
john
room
i
say
jonathan
i
glad
you
knew
that
i
would
fail
you
as
the
demon
says
you
are
clever
you
are
a
sight
cleverer
than
he
is
john
shook
his
head
i
slow
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
thought
that
you
would
come
to
the
rescue
never
occurred
to
me
till
i
was
biking
back
from
town
anyway
you
saved
me
from
being
sacked
and
as
long
as
i
live
i
come
on
to
breakfast

john

of

to
which
john
received
an
invitation
he
accepted
because

made
a

was
quite
aware
that

at
that
time
most
of
the
conservative
papers
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
to
arms
but
scaife
father
admittedly
a
great
authority
on
south
african
affairs
had
told
his
son
a
fight
was
inevitable
more
he
and
his
friends
were
already
preparing
to
raise
a
regiment
of
mounted
infantry
at
breakfast
scaife
announced
this
piece
of
news
and
added
that
in
the
event
of
hostilities
he
would
join
this
regiment
and
not
try
to
pass
into
sandhurst
and
he
added
that
any
of
his
friends
who
were
present
and
over
eighteen
years
of
age
were
cordially
invited
to
send
in
their
names
and
that
he
personally
would
do
all
that
was
possible
to
secure
them
billets
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
cæsar
desmond
was
on
his
feet
with
an
eager
put
me
down
demon
put
me
down
first
and
then
scaife
glanced
at
john
as
he
answered
right
you
are
cæsar
and
if
things
go
well
with
us
i
fancy
that
we
shall
get
our
commissions
in
regular
regiments
soon
enough
the
governor
had
had
a
hint
to
that
effect
let
drink
success
to
horse
the
toast
was
drunk
with
enthusiasm
during
the
holidays
john
saw
nothing
of
desmond
although
they
wrote
to
each
other
once
a
week
john
was
reading
hard
with
an
eye
to
a
possible
scholarship
at
oxford
desmond
was
playing
cricket
with
scaife
later
desmond
went
to
the
scaife
moor
in
scotland
john
noted
that
his
friend
letters
were
full
of
two
things
only
sport
and
the
probability
of
war
at
the
end
of
august
john
verney
the
explorer
returning
to
verney
boscobel
after
an
absence
of
nearly
four
years
began
to
write
his
now
famous
book
on
the
far
east
then
john
learned
from
his
mother
that
his
uncle
had
borne
all
the
charges
of
his
education
when
he
thanked
him
the
uncle
said
warmly
you
have
more
than
repaid
me
my
dear
boy
not
another
word
please
about
that
warde
tells
me
they
expect
great
things
of
you
at
oxford
uncle
and
nephew
were
alone
after
dinner
john
had
noticed
that
the
hardships
endured
in
manchuria
and
thibet
had
left
scars
upon
the
traveller
his
hair
was
white
he
looked
an
old
man
one
whose
wanderings
in
wild
places
must
perforce
come
soon
to
an
end
uncle
said
john
i
want
to
chuck
oxford
eh
i
should
like
to
go
into
the
army
bless
my
soul
the
explorer
eyed
his
nephew
with
wrinkled
brow
john
gave
reasons
we
can
guess
what
they
were
the
prospect
of
war
had
set
all
ardent
souls
afire
i
must
think
this
over
my
boy
the
uncle
replied
presently
i
must
sleep
on
it
have
you
told
your
mother
no
i
counted
upon
you
to
persuade
her
um
now
tell
me
about
lord
ah
i
sorry
i
missed
that
match
next
day
his
uncle
said
nothing
of
what
lay
next
to
john
heart
but
the
pair
rode
together
over
the
estate
during
that
ride
it
became
plain
to
the
young
man
that
his
uncle
had
no
intention
of
settling
down
once
or
twice
in
the
driest
most
tone
the
elder
spoke
as
if
his
heir
were
likely
to
inherit
soon
finally
john
blurted
out
a
protest
but
uncle
you
are
a
strong
man
why
do
you
talk
as
if
as
if
the
boy
could
finish
the
phrase
tut
tut
said
the
uncle
i
know
what
i
know
and
he
fell
into
silence
not
till
the
evening
after
verney
had
gone
to
bed
did
the
man
of
many
wanderings
speak
freely
john
said
he
quietly
i
have
a
story
to
tell
you
years
ago
your
father
and
i
fell
in
love
with
the
same
girl
she
married
the
better
man
he
paused
to
fill
a
pipe
john
saw
that
his
uncle
fingers
trembled
slightly
but
his
voice
was
cool
measured
almost
monotonous
i
made
my
first
expedition
to
patagonia
when
i
came
back
you
were
just
born
and
i
asked
that
i
might
be
your
godfather
i
went
to
africa
after
the
christening
and
six
years
later
your
father
died
i
think
he
had
the
purest
and
most
unselfish
love
of
the
poor
and
helpless
that
i
have
ever
known
he
wore
away
his
life
in
the
service
of
the
outcast
and
forlorn
and
before
he
died
he
expressed
a
wish
that
you
should
work
as
he
did
for
others
but
not
in
precisely
the
same
way
he
knew
none
better
the
limitations
imposed
upon
a
parson
he
prayed
that
you
might
labour
in
a
field
larger
than
one
parish
and
i
promised
him
that
i
would
do
what
i
could
when
the
time
came
it
has
come
in
my
opinion
in
warde
opinion
in
your
dear
mother
opinion
parliament
is
the
place
for
you
you
will
be
sufficiently
well
off
take
all
oxford
can
give
you
and
then
try
for
the
house
of
commons
charles
desmond
will
make
you
one
of
his
private
secretaries
i
have
spoken
to
him
you
have
a
great
career
before
you
but
if
war
breaks
out
uncle
war
break
out
do
misunderstand
me
if
you
are
wanted
out
there
and
the
thing
is
going
to
be
very
serious
if
you
are
wanted
you
must
go
but
decidedly
you
are
not
wanted
yet
and
you
are
an
only
son
all
your
mother
has
john
you
must
think
of
her
and
you
will
think
of
her
i
know
the
conviction
in
his
quiet
voice
communicated
itself
to
his
nephew
there
was
a
pause
of
nearly
a
minute
and
then
john
answered
in
a
voice
curiously
like
his
uncle
all
right
verney
senior
held
out
his
hand
i
knew
you
would
say
that
he
murmured
on
the
of
september
when
john
returned
to
the
hill
the
country
had
just
learned
that
the
proposals
of
the
imperial
government
to
accept
the
note
of
august
provided
it
were
not
encumbered
by
conditions
which
would
nullify
the
intention
to
give
substantial
representation
to
the
uitlanders
had
not
been
accepted
that
this
meant
war
none
least
of
all
a
schoolboy
doubted
desmond
could
talk
of
nothing
else
he
told
john
that
his
father
had
promised
to
let
him
leave
harrow
before
the
end
of
the
term
if
war
were
declared
the
demon
so
john
was
informed
had
made
already
preparations
he
was
taking
out
his
three
polo
ponies
and
had
hopes
of
being
appointed
galloper
to
a
certain
general
horse
was
being
organized
but
in
any
case
would
not
take
the
field
before
several
months
had
elapsed
the
demon
intended
to
be
on
the
spot
when
the
first
shot
was
fired
to
all
this
john
listened
with
envious
ears
and
a
curious
sinking
of
the
heart
he
had
looked
forward
to
having
desmond
to
himself
and
lo
his
friend
was
seven
thousand
miles
away
on
the
veldt
not
on
the
hill
you
are
not
keen
said
desmond
on
the
day
of
the
goose
match
saturday
september
scaife
came
down
to
harrow
to
take
leave
of
his
friends
already
john
noted
an
extraordinary
difference
in
his
manner
and
appearance
he
treated
john
to
a
slightly
patronizing
smile
called
him
jonathan
asked
if
he
could
be
of
service
to
him
and
posed
most
successfully
as
a
sort
of
sucking
alexander
that
he
absorbed
desmond
eyes
and
mind
was
indisputable
everything
outside
south
africa
and
in
particular
the
hill
and
all
things
thereon
dwindled
into
insignificance
scaife
made
desmond
a
present
of
the
very
best
maps
obtainable
and
nailed
them
on
the
wall
above
the
mantelpiece
pulling
down
a
fine
engraving
which
john
had
given
to
desmond
about
a
year
before
desmond
uttered
no
protest
the
engraving
was
bundled
out
of
sight
behind
a
sofa
and
after
scaife
departure
desmond
talked
of
him
continually
and
always
with
enthusiasm
warde
added
a
note
or
two
to
the
chorus
this
is
an
opportunity
for
scaife
he
told
john
he
may
distinguish
himself
very
greatly
and
the
discipline
of
the
camp
will
transmute
the
bad
metal
into
gold
war
is
an
alchemist
upon
the
of
october
war
was
declared
after
that
desmond
became
as
one
possessed
he
went
about
saying
that
he
pitied
his
father
profoundly
because
he
was
a
civilian
and
a
warde
wrote
to
charles
desmond
if
you
mean
to
send
harry
out
send
him
at
once
he
fretting
himself
to
doing
no
work
and
causing
others
to
do
no
work
also
sir
william
symons
victory
and
death
followed
and
then
the
mortifying
retreat
of
general
yule
upon
the
day
of
the
month
eight
hundred
and
fifty
officers
and
men
were
isolated
and
captured
who
does
not
remember
the
wave
of
passionate
incredulity
that
swept
across
the
kingdom
when
the
evil
tidings
flashed
but
buller
and
his
staff
were
on
the
and
all
harrovians
believed
devoutly
that
within
a
month
of
landing
the
would
drive
the
invaders
back
and
conquer
the
transvaal
day
after
day
desmond
importuned
his
father
the
fun
would
be
over
he
pointed
out
before
he
got
there
and
so
on
at
last
word
came
a
billet
had
been
obtained
desmond
received
a
long
envelope
from
the
war
office
he
showed
it
to
all
his
friends
old
and
young
duff
junior
cæsar
fag
became
so
excited
that
he
asked
warde
for
permission
to
enlist
as
a
the
school
cheered
cæsar
at
four
bill
and
then
came
the
parting
cæsar
was
to
join
the
headquarters
staff
as
soon
as
possible
he
spent
the
last
hours
with
john
but
his
mind
naturally
enough
was
concentrated
upon
his
kit
he
chattered
endlessly
of
saddlery
revolvers
sleeping
bags
and
zeiss
glasses
john
packed
his
portmanteau
and
on
the
morrow
the
friends
parted
at
the
station
without
a
word
beyond
old
jonathan
wish
you
were
coming
cæsar
good
luck
and
then
the
shrill
whistle
the
inexorable
rolling
of
the
wheels
the
bright
eager
face
leaning
far
out
of
the
window
the
waved
handkerchief
the
last
words
so
long
and
john
reply
so
long
john
saw
the
face
fade
the
wheels
of
the
vanishing
train
seemed
to
have
rolled
over
his
heart
the
scream
of
the
engine
was
the
scream
of
anguish
from
himself
he
left
the
station
and
ran
to
the
tower
there
after
the
first
indescribable
moments
some
kindly
spirit
touched
him
he
became
whole
but
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
boy
alone
upon
the
tower
he
prayed
for
his
friend
prayed
fervently
that
it
might
be
well
with
him
now
and
for
ever
amen
when
he
returned
to
the
manor
however
peace
seemed
to
forsake
him
the
horrible
gap
between
himself
and
desmond
might
indeed
be
bridged
by
prayer
but
not
by
the
shouts
of
boys
and
the
turmoil
of
a
public
school
during
the
rest
of
the
term
he
worked
furiously
desmond
was
now
on
the
high
seas
whither
john
followed
him
at
night
and
on
sundays
warde
guessing
perhaps
what
was
passing
in
john
heart
talked
much
of
desmond
always
hopefully
from
warde
john
learned
that
charles
desmond
had
tried
to
dissuade
his
favourite
son
from
becoming
a
soldier
he
wanted
him
to
go
into
parliament
said
warde
john
nodded
it
was
a
disappointment
yes
a
great
disappointment
harry
would
have
made
a
debater
yes
yes
a
nimble
wit
an
engaging
manner
and
the
gift
of
the
gab
and
the
father
would
have
had
him
under
his
own
eye
but
he
wanted
to
go
to
south
africa
from
the
beginning
you
wanted
to
go
said
warde
your
uncle
told
me
so
it
was
a
greater
thing
for
you
john
to
stand
aside
and
then
john
put
a
question
do
you
think
that
harry
ought
to
have
stood
aside
too
warde
however
unwilling
to
commit
himself
spoke
of
harry
ardour
and
patriotism
but
at
the
end
he
let
fall
a
straw
which
indicated
the
true
current
of
his
thoughts
desmond
is
very
lonely
john
swooped
on
this
then
you
think
you
think
that
harry
should
have
stayed
behind
perhaps
one
hesitates
to
accuse
the
boy
of
anything
more
than
thoughtlessness
if
he
wished
to
serve
his
country
began
john
warmly
warde
smiled
yes
yes
he
assented
let
us
believe
that
john
but
there
has
been
too
much
cheap
excitement
dark
days
followed
who
will
ever
forget
stormberg
and
magersfontein
a
pall
seemed
to
hang
over
the
kingdom
ladysmith
remained
in
the
grip
of
the
invader
the
boers
were
not
yet
driven
out
of
natal
meantime
cæsar
had
reached
sir
redvers
buller
a
letter
to
his
father
describing
the
few
incidents
of
the
voyage
out
and
his
arrival
in
south
africa
was
sent
on
to
john
and
received
by
him
on
the
of
february
john
will
understand
said
cæsar
in
a
postscript
that
i
have
little
time
for
writing
but
john
did
not
understand
he
wrote
regularly
to
desmond
no
answer
came
in
return
at
the
end
of
the
christmas
holidays
john
returned
to
harrow
he
was
now
head
of
his
house
and
very
nearly
head
of
the
school
the
weeks
went
by
slowly
soon
he
and
a
few
others
would
travel
to
oxford
for
their
examination
there
would
be
the
strenuous
excitement
of
competition
and
the
final
announcement
of
success
or
failure
to
all
this
john
told
himself
that
he
was
lukewarm
nothing
seemed
to
matter
since
he
had
lost
sight
of
cæsar
face
since
the
train
whirled
his
friend
out
of
his
life
but
he
worked
hard
so
hard
that
the
head
master
bade
him
beware
of
a
breakdown
the
hour
of
triumph
came
john
had
gratified
his
own
and
ambition
he
was
a
scholar
of
christ
church
and
this
success
seemed
to
draw
something
in
his
heart
the
congratulations
the
warm
the
generous
joy
of
schoolfellows
not
as
fortunate
restored
his
moral
circulation
a
whole
holiday
was
granted
in
honour
of
his
success
at
oxford
he
told
himself
that
now
he
would
take
things
easy
and
enjoy
himself
the
clouds
in
south
africa
were
lifting
everybody
said
the
glorious
end
was
in
sight
and
so
far
desmond
had
escaped
wounds
and
sickness
he
had
received
a
commission
in
beauregard
irregular
horse
in
the
five
days
action
about
spion
kop
he
behaved
with
conspicuous
gallantry
scaife
having
obtained
his
billet
of
galloper
was
with
a
general
under
lord
methuen
on
the
last
monday
but
one
in
the
term
john
was
entering
the
manor
just
before
when
a
sixth
form
boy
from
another
house
passed
him
running
have
you
heard
about
poor
scaife
he
called
out
no
what
warde
will
tell
you
he
knows
the
boy
ran
on
not
wishing
to
be
late
john
ran
too
with
his
heart
thumping
against
his
side
he
felt
certain
from
the
expression
upon
the
boy
face
that
scaife
was
dead
and
john
recalled
with
intense
bitterness
and
humiliation
moments
in
past
years
when
he
had
wished
that
scaife
would
die
charles
desmond
had
told
him
only
three
weeks
before
that
his
harry
hoped
to
join
the
smart
cavalry
regiment
in
which
a
commission
had
been
promised
to
scaife
at
that
moment
john
was
sensible
of
an
inordinate
desire
for
anything
that
might
come
between
this
wish
and
its
fulfilment
and
now
scaife
might
be
lying
dead
he
found
warde
in
his
study
staring
at
a
telegram
he
looked
up
as
john
entered
and
in
silence
handed
him
the
message
dead
died
the
telegram
came
from
an
harrovian
an
old
manorite
at
the
war
office
john
sat
down
stunned
by
the
news
warde
regarded
him
gravely
john
met
his
glance
and
could
not
interpret
it
presently
warde
said
nervously
why
did
the
fellow
write
instead
of
i
do
like
that
he
looked
sharply
at
john
who
did
not
understand
then
he
added
i
wired
for
confirmation
there
may
be
a
mistake
what
mistake
said
john
warde
manner
confused
him
frightened
him
what
mistake
sir
warde
twisting
the
paper
answered
miserably
there
has
been
an
action
but
not
in
scaife
part
of
africa
beauregard
horse
were
engaged
and
suffered
severely
and
would
any
one
say
in
such
a
serious
context
oh
my
god
said
john
pale
and
trembling
at
last
he
understood
add
two
letters
to
demon
and
you
have
desmond
how
easily
such
a
mistake
could
be
made
desmond
handed
to
an
old
manorite
to
copy
and
despatch
it
scaife
it
scaife
john
cried
warde
said
nothing
staring
at
the
thin
slip
of
paper
as
if
he
were
trying
to
wrest
from
it
its
secret
everybody
called
him
said
john
still
one
ought
to
be
prepared
for
many
hideous
minutes
they
sat
there
silent
waiting
for
the
second
telegram
dumbleton
brought
it
in
and
lingered
anxiously
expectant
but
warde
dismissed
him
with
a
gesture
as
the
door
closed
warde
stood
up
if
our
fears
are
well
founded
he
said
solemnly
may
god
give
you
strength
john
verney
to
bear
the
blow
then
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
the
truth
desmond
killed
in
no
said
john
fiercely
it
is
scaife
scaife
warde
shook
his
head
holding
john
hand
tight
between
his
sinewy
fingers
john
face
appalled
him
he
had
known
he
had
guessed
the
strength
of
john
feeling
for
desmond
but
he
had
not
known
the
strength
of
john
hatred
of
scaife
and
desmond
had
been
taken
and
scaife
left
the
irony
of
it
tore
the
soul
do
speak
commanded
warde
john
closed
his
lips
with
instinctive
obedience
when
he
opened
them
again
his
face
had
softened
the
words
fell
upon
the
silence
with
a
heartrending
inflection
of
misery
and
now
i
shall
never
know
i
shall
never
know
he
broke
down
piteously
warde
let
the
first
passion
of
grief
spend
itself
then
he
asked
john
to
explain
the
good
fellow
saw
that
if
john
could
give
his
trouble
words
it
would
be
lightened
enormously
he
divined
what
had
been
suppressed
what
is
it
that
you
will
never
know
john
at
that
john
spoke
laying
bare
his
heart
he
gave
details
of
the
struggle
between
scaife
and
himself
for
the
soul
of
his
friend
gave
them
with
a
clearness
of
expression
which
proved
beyond
all
else
how
his
thoughts
had
crystallized
in
his
mind
warde
listened
holding
john
hand
gripping
it
with
sympathy
and
affection
the
romance
of
this
friendship
stirred
him
profoundly
the
romance
of
the
struggle
for
good
and
evil
a
struggle
of
which
the
issues
remained
still
in
doubt
a
romance
which
death
had
cruelly
left
unfinished
this
had
poignant
significance
for
the
i
shall
never
know
now
john
repeated
in
conclusion
but
you
have
faith
in
your
friend
he
never
wrote
to
me
said
john
at
last
it
was
out
the
thorn
in
his
side
which
had
tormented
him
if
he
had
written
john
continued
if
only
he
had
written
once
when
we
parted
it
was
just
that
nothing
more
but
i
thought
he
would
write
and
that
everything
would
be
cleared
up
and
now
silence
the
week
wore
itself
away
a
few
details
were
forthcoming
enough
to
prove
that
a
glorious
deed
had
been
done
at
the
cost
of
a
gallant
life
england
was
thrilled
because
the
hero
happened
to
be
the
son
of
a
popular
minister
the
name
of
desmond
rang
through
the
empire
john
bought
every
paper
and
devoured
the
meagre
lines
which
left
so
much
between
them
it
seemed
that
a
certain
position
had
to
be
taken
a
small
hill
for
the
hundredth
time
in
this
campaign
too
few
men
were
detailed
for
the
task
the
reek
of
that
awful
slaughter
on
spion
kop
was
still
strong
in
men
nostrils
beauregard
and
his
soldiers
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
halted
in
the
teeth
of
a
storm
of
bullets
then
the
word
was
given
to
attack
but
the
fire
from
invisible
foes
simply
exterminated
the
leading
files
the
moment
came
when
those
behind
wavered
and
recoiled
and
then
desmond
darted
forward
alone
cheering
on
his
fellows
they
were
all
afoot
the
men
rallied
and
followed
but
they
could
not
overtake
the
gallant
figure
pressing
on
in
front
he
ran
so
the
special
correspondent
reported
as
if
he
were
racing
for
a
goal
the
men
staggered
after
him
aflame
with
his
ardour
they
reached
the
top
captured
the
guns
drove
down
the
enemy
and
returned
to
the
highest
point
to
find
their
leader
shot
through
the
heart
and
dead
and
smiling
at
death
of
all
the
men
who
passed
through
that
blizzard
of
bullets
he
was
the
youngest
by
two
years
warde
told
john
that
the
head
master
would
preach
upon
the
last
sunday
evening
of
the
term
with
special
reference
to
harry
desmond
could
john
bear
it
john
nodded
since
the
first
breakdown
in
warde
study
his
heart
seemed
to
have
turned
to
ice
his
religious
sense
hitherto
strong
and
vital
failed
him
entirely
he
abandoned
prayer
evensong
was
over
in
harrow
chapel
the
head
master
stately
in
surplice
and
scarlet
hood
entered
the
pulpit
and
in
his
clear
calm
tones
announced
his
text
taken
from
the
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
the
book
of
ruth
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
ought
but
death
part
thee
and
me
the
subject
of
the
sermon
was
friendship
the
heart
blood
of
a
public
school
friendship
with
its
delights
its
perils
its
peculiar
graces
and
benedictions
concluded
the
preacher
amid
the
breathless
silence
of
the
congregation
this
thought
of
friendship
has
for
us
a
special
solemnity
it
is
consecrated
by
the
memory
of
one
whom
we
have
just
lost
you
who
are
leaving
the
school
have
been
the
friends
and
contemporaries
of
henry
julius
desmond
his
features
are
fresh
in
your
memories
and
will
remain
fresh
as
long
as
you
live
tall
eager
a
face
to
remember
a
flush
that
could
change
as
the
day
a
spirit
that
knew
not
december
that
brightened
the
sunshine
of
may
those
lines
as
you
know
were
written
of
another
harrovian
who
died
here
on
this
hill
henry
desmond
died
on
another
hill
and
died
so
gloriously
that
the
shadow
of
our
loss
dark
as
it
seemed
to
us
at
first
is
already
melting
in
the
radiance
of
his
gain
to
die
young
clean
ardent
to
die
swiftly
in
perfect
health
to
die
saving
others
from
death
or
worse
disgrace
to
die
scaling
heights
to
die
and
to
carry
with
you
into
the
fuller
ampler
life
beyond
untainted
hopes
and
aspirations
unembittered
memories
all
the
freshness
and
gladness
of
may
is
not
that
cause
for
joy
rather
than
sorrow
i
say
yes
henry
desmond
is
one
stage
ahead
of
us
upon
a
journey
which
we
all
must
take
and
i
entreat
you
to
consider
that
if
we
have
faith
in
a
future
life
we
must
believe
also
that
we
carry
hence
not
only
the
record
of
our
acts
whether
good
or
evil
but
the
memory
of
them
and
that
memory
undimmed
by
falsehood
or
will
create
for
us
heaven
or
hell
i
do
not
say
god
forbid
that
you
should
desire
death
because
you
are
still
young
and
comparatively
speaking
unspotted
from
the
world
but
i
say
i
would
sooner
see
any
of
you
struck
down
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
than
living
on
to
lose
long
before
death
comes
all
that
makes
life
worth
the
living
better
death
a
thousand
times
than
gradual
decay
of
mind
and
spirit
better
death
than
faithlessness
indifference
and
uncleanness
to
you
who
are
leaving
harrow
poised
for
flight
into
the
great
world
of
which
this
school
is
the
microcosm
i
commend
the
memory
of
henry
desmond
it
stands
in
our
records
for
all
we
venerate
and
strive
for
loyalty
honour
purity
strenuousness
faithfulness
in
friendship
when
temptation
assails
you
think
of
that
gallant
boy
running
swiftly
uphill
leaving
craven
fear
behind
and
drawing
with
him
the
others
who
led
by
him
to
the
heights
made
victory
possible
you
can
not
all
be
leaders
but
you
can
follow
leaders
only
see
to
it
that
they
lead
you
as
henry
desmond
led
the
men
of
beauregard
horse
onward
and
upward
the
preacher
ended
and
then
followed
the
familiar
hymn
always
sung
upon
the
last
sunday
evening
of
the
term
let
thy
be
shielding
all
who
here
shall
meet
no
more
may
their
past
be
yielding
year
by
year
a
richer
store
those
returning
make
more
faithful
than
before
the
last
blessing
was
pronounced
and
with
glistening
eyes
the
boys
streamed
out
of
chapel
some
of
them
for
the
last
time
upon
the
next
tuesday
john
travelled
down
into
the
new
forest
april
was
abroad
in
hampshire
the
larches
already
were
bright
green
against
the
scotch
firs
the
beech
buds
were
bursting
only
the
oaks
retained
their
drab
during
the
few
days
preceding
easter
sunday
john
rode
or
walked
to
every
part
of
the
forest
which
he
had
visited
in
company
with
his
dead
friend
at
beaulieu
standing
in
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
he
could
hear
desmond
delightful
laugh
as
he
recited
the
misadventures
of
hordle
john
at
stoneycross
he
sat
upon
the
bank
overlooking
the
moor
whence
they
had
seen
the
fox
steal
into
the
woods
about
rufus
stone
at
the
bell
tavern
at
brook
they
had
lunched
at
hinton
admiral
they
had
played
cricket
to
his
mother
and
his
uncle
silent
sympathy
john
responded
but
churlishly
his
friend
had
departed
without
a
word
without
a
sign
that
ate
into
john
heart
and
consumed
it
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
confirmed
he
refused
to
receive
the
sacrament
he
went
to
church
as
a
matter
of
form
but
he
dared
not
approach
the
altar
in
his
present
rebellious
mood
again
and
again
he
accused
himself
of
having
yielded
to
a
craven
fear
of
offending
desmond
by
speech
too
plain
always
he
had
been
so
terribly
afraid
of
losing
his
friend
and
now
he
had
lost
him
indeed
this
poignancy
of
grief
may
be
accounted
for
in
part
by
the
previous
strain
of
overwork
and
it
is
ever
the
habit
of
those
who
do
much
to
think
that
they
might
have
done
more
at
the
beginning
of
may
john
came
back
to
the
hill
for
his
last
term
out
of
the
future
rose
the
dreaming
spires
of
oxford
beyond
them
vague
and
shadowy
the
great
of
westminster
keeping
watch
and
ward
over
the
destinies
of
our
empire
in
a
long
letter
from
charles
desmond
the
minister
had
spoken
of
the
secretaryship
to
be
kept
warm
for
him
of
the
pleasure
and
solace
the
writer
would
take
in
seeing
his
son
best
friend
in
the
place
where
that
son
might
have
stood
his
best
friend
was
that
true
the
question
tormented
john
because
cæsar
had
been
so
much
to
him
he
desired
more
passionately
than
he
had
desired
anything
in
his
life
the
assurance
that
he
had
been
something
not
everything
only
something
to
cæsar
one
day
about
the
middle
of
the
month
john
had
been
playing
cricket
the
game
of
all
games
which
brought
cæsar
most
vividly
to
his
mind
then
just
before
six
bill
he
strolled
up
the
hill
and
into
the
vaughan
library
where
so
many
relics
dear
to
harrovians
are
enshrined
sitting
in
the
splendid
window
which
faces
distant
hampstead
john
told
himself
that
he
must
put
aside
the
miseries
and
perplexities
of
the
past
month
had
he
been
loyal
to
his
friend
memory
would
not
a
more
ardent
faith
have
burned
away
doubt
john
gazed
across
the
familiar
fields
to
the
huge
city
on
the
horizon
soon
night
would
fall
darkness
would
encompass
all
things
and
then
out
of
the
mirk
would
shine
the
lamps
of
london
warde
voice
put
his
thoughts
to
instant
flight
some
intuition
told
john
that
something
had
happened
warde
said
quietly
a
letter
has
come
for
you
in
harry
desmond
handwriting
john
unable
to
speak
stretched
out
his
hand
take
it
said
warde
to
some
quiet
spot
where
you
can
not
be
disturbed
john
nodded
i
have
seen
how
it
was
with
you
warde
continued
with
deep
emotion
and
you
have
had
my
acute
sympathy
the
more
acute
perhaps
because
long
ago
a
friend
went
out
of
my
life
without
a
sign
warde
paused
now
unless
my
whole
experience
is
at
fault
you
hold
in
your
hand
what
you
want
and
what
you
deserve
warde
left
the
library
john
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
where
should
he
go
one
place
beckoned
him
upon
the
tower
looking
towards
the
hill
he
would
read
the
last
letter
of
his
friend
within
half
an
hour
he
was
passing
through
the
iron
gates
he
had
not
visited
the
garden
since
that
forlorn
winter
afternoon
when
he
came
here
alone
after
bidding
desmond
he
could
recall
the
desolation
of
the
scene
bleak
winter
dripping
tears
upon
the
tomb
of
summer
with
what
disgust
he
had
perceived
the
decaying
masses
of
vegetation
the
sodden
turf
the
soot
upon
the
bare
trunks
of
the
trees
he
had
rushed
away
fancying
that
he
heard
desmond
voice
there
is
a
curse
on
the
place
now
may
had
touched
what
had
seemed
dead
and
hideous
and
lo
a
miracle
the
hawthorns
shone
white
against
the
brilliant
green
of
the
laurels
the
had
to
use
a
fanciful
expression
of
cæsar
lit
their
lamps
out
of
the
waving
grass
glimmered
and
sparkled
a
thousand
wild
flowers
john
heard
the
glad
of
bees
and
birds
then
opening
his
lungs
he
inhaled
the
odours
of
earth
renascent
opening
his
heart
he
felt
a
spiritual
essence
pervading
every
fibre
of
his
being
once
more
the
chilled
sap
in
his
veins
flowed
generously
it
was
well
with
him
and
well
with
his
friend
this
conviction
possessed
him
remember
before
he
opened
the
letter
he
ascended
the
tower
and
broke
the
seal
i
have
been
meaning
to
write
to
you
dear
old
chap
ever
since
we
parted
but
somehow
i
could
bring
myself
to
tackle
it
in
earnest
till
we
have
a
thundering
big
job
ahead
of
us
the
last
job
perhaps
for
me
old
jonathan
you
have
been
the
best
friend
a
man
ever
had
the
only
one
i
love
as
much
as
my
own
brothers
even
it
was
from
knowing
you
that
i
came
to
see
what
fools
some
fellows
are
you
were
always
so
unselfish
and
and
you
made
me
feel
that
i
was
the
contrary
and
that
you
knew
it
and
that
i
should
lose
your
friendship
if
i
did
improve
a
bit
so
if
we
meet
again
in
this
jolly
old
world
it
may
be
a
little
comfort
to
you
to
remember
that
what
you
have
done
for
a
very
worthless
pal
was
not
thrown
away
good
night
jonathan
i
going
to
turn
in
we
shall
be
astir
before
daybreak
over
the
veldt
the
stars
are
shining
it
so
light
that
i
can
just
make
out
the
hill
upon
which
i
hope
our
flag
will
be
waving
within
a
few
hours
the
sight
of
this
hill
brings
back
our
hill
if
i
shut
my
eyes
i
can
see
it
plainly
as
we
used
to
see
it
from
the
tower
with
the
spire
rising
out
of
the
heart
of
the
old
school
i
have
the
absurd
conviction
strong
in
me
that
i
shall
get
up
the
hill
here
faster
and
easier
than
the
other
fellows
because
you
and
i
have
so
often
run
up
our
hill
together
god
bless
it
and
you

night
