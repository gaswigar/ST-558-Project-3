remember
you
thought
it
strange
that
my
first
trip
abroad
didn
t
make
me
want
to
write
about
what
i
saw
there
but
since
then
i
have
visited
a
country
which
stimulated
me
to
express
it
in
words
and
as
i
wrote
these
impressions
of
mexico
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
that
i
never
would
have
seen
what
i
did
see
had
it
not
been
for
your
teaching
can
only
add
my
word
to
what
so
many
who
are
writing
already
have
told
you
that
to
listen
to
you
is
to
learn
how
to
see
the
hidden
beauty
of
the
visible
world
that
to
be
your
friend
is
to
try
to
be
intellectually
i
dedicate
this
book
to
you
with
the
understanding
that
you
shall
take
as
your
own
the

the
mercado
s
federal
army
after
its
dramatic
and
terrible
retreat
four
hundred
miles
across
the
desert
when
chihuahua
was
abandoned
lay
three
months
at
ojinaga
on
the
rio
grande
at
presidio
on
the
american
side
of
the
river
one
could
climb
to
the
flat
mud
roof
of
the
post
office
and
look
across
the
mile
or
so
of
low
scrub
growing
in
the
sand
to
the
shallow
yellow
stream
and
beyond
to
the
low
where
the
town
was
sticking
sharply
up
out
of
a
scorched
desert
ringed
round
with
bare
savage
mountains
one
could
see
the
square
gray
adobe
houses
of
ojinaga
with
here
and
there
the
oriental
cupola
of
an
old
spanish
church
it
was
a
desolate
land
without
trees
you
expected
minarets
by
day
federal
soldiers
in
shabby
white
uniforms
swarmed
about
the
place
desultorily
digging
trenches
for
villa
and
his
victorious
constitutionalists
were
rumored
to
be
on
the
way
you
got
sudden
glints
where
the
sun
flashed
on
field
guns
strange
thick
clouds
of
smoke
rose
straight
in
the
still
air
toward
evening
when
the
sun
went
down
with
the
flare
of
a
blast
furnace
patrols
of
cavalry
rode
sharply
across
the
skyline
to
the
night
outposts
and
after
dark
mysterious
fires
burned
in
the
town
there
were
hundred
men
in
ojinaga
this
was
all
that
remained
of
mercado
s
army
of
ten
thousand
and
the
five
thousand
which
pascual
orozco
had
marched
north
from
mexico
city
to
reinforce
him
of
this
hundred
were
majors
colonels
and
eleven
generals
i
wanted
to
interview
general
mercado
but
one
of
the
newspapers
had
printed
something
displeasing
to
general
salazar
and
he
had
forbidden
the
reporters
the
town
i
sent
a
polite
request
to
general
mercado
the
note
was
intercepted
by
general
orozco
who
sent
back
the
following
reply
esteemed
and
honored
sir
if
you
set
foot
inside
of
ojinaga
i
will
stand
you
sideways
against
a
wall
and
with
my
own
hand
take
great
pleasure
in
shooting
furrows
in
your
back
but
after
all
i
waded
the
river
one
day
and
went
up
into
the
town
luckily
i
did
not
meet
general
orozco
no
one
seemed
to
object
to
my
entrance
all
the
sentries
i
saw
were
taking
a
siesta
on
the
shady
side
of
adobe
walls
but
almost
immediately
i
encountered
a
courteous
officer
named
hernandez
to
whom
i
explained
that
i
wished
to
see
general
mercado
without
inquiring
as
to
my
identity
he
scowled
folded
his
arms
and
burst
out
i
am
general
orozco
s
chief
of
staff
and
i
will
not
take
you
to
see
general
mercado
i
said
nothing
in
a
few
minutes
he
explained
general
orozco
hates
general
mercado
he
does
not
deign
to
go
to
general
mercado
s
cuartel
and
general
mercado
does
not
dare
to
come
to
general
orozco
s
cuartel
he
is
a
coward
he
ran
away
from
tierra
blanca
and
then
he
ran
away
from
chihuahua
what
other
generals
don
t
you
like
i
asked
he
caught
himself
and
slanted
an
angry
look
at
me
and
then
grinned
sabe
i
saw
general
mercado
a
fat
pathetic
worried
undecided
little
man
who
blubbered
and
blustered
a
long
tale
about
how
the
united
states
army
had
come
across
the
river
and
helped
villa
to
win
the
battle
of
tierra
blanca
the
white
dusty
streets
of
the
town
piled
high
with
filth
and
fodder
the
ancient
windowless
church
with
its
three
enormous
spanish
bells
hanging
on
a
rack
outside
and
a
cloud
of
blue
incense
crawling
out
of
the
black
doorway
where
the
women
camp
followers
of
the
army
prayed
for
victory
day
and
night
lay
in
hot
breathless
sun
five
times
had
ojinaga
been
lost
and
taken
hardly
a
house
that
had
a
roof
and
all
the
walls
gaped
with
in
these
bare
gutted
rooms
lived
the
soldiers
their
women
their
horses
their
chickens
and
pigs
raided
from
the
surrounding
country
guns
were
stacked
in
the
corners
saddles
piled
in
the
dust
the
soldiers
were
in
rags
scarcely
one
possessed
a
complete
uniform
they
squatted
around
little
fires
in
their
doorways
boiling
and
dried
meat
they
were
almost
starving
along
the
main
street
passed
an
unbroken
procession
of
sick
exhausted
starving
people
driven
from
the
interior
by
fear
of
the
approaching
rebels
a
journey
of
eight
days
over
the
most
terrible
desert
in
the
world
they
were
stopped
by
a
hundred
soldiers
along
the
street
and
robbed
of
every
possession
that
took
the
federals
fancy
then
they
passed
on
to
the
river
and
on
the
american
side
they
had
to
run
the
gantlet
of
the
united
states
customs
and
immigration
officials
and
the
army
border
patrol
who
searched
them
for
arms
hundreds
of
refugees
poured
across
the
river
some
on
horseback
driving
cattle
before
them
some
in
wagons
and
others
on
foot
the
inspectors
were
not
very
gentle
come
down
off
that
wagon
one
would
shout
to
a
mexican
woman
with
a
bundle
in
her
arm
but
señor
for
what
reason
she
would
begin
come
down
there
or
i
ll
pull
you
down
he
would
yell
they
made
an
unnecessarily
careful
and
brutal
search
of
the
men
and
of
the
women
too
as
i
stood
there
a
woman
waded
across
the
ford
her
skirts
lifted
unconcernedly
to
her
thighs
she
wore
a
voluminous
shawl
which
was
humped
up
in
front
as
if
she
were
carrying
something
in
it
hi
there
shouted
a
customs
man
what
have
you
got
under
your
shawl
she
slowly
opened
the
front
of
her
dress
and
answered
placidly
i
don
t
know
señor
it
may
be
a
girl
or
it
may
be
a
boy
these
were
metropolitan
days
for
presidio
a
straggling
and
indescribably
desolate
village
of
about
fifteen
adobe
houses
scattered
without
much
plan
in
the
deep
sand
and
scrub
along
the
river
bottom
old
kleinmann
the
german
made
a
fortune
a
day
outfitting
refugees
and
supplying
the
federal
army
across
the
river
with
provisions
he
had
three
beautiful
adolescent
daughters
whom
he
kept
locked
up
in
the
attic
of
the
store
because
a
flock
of
amorous
mexicans
and
ardent
prowled
around
like
dogs
drawn
from
many
miles
away
by
the
fame
of
these
damsels
half
the
time
he
spent
working
furiously
in
the
store
stripped
to
the
waist
and
the
remainder
rushing
around
with
a
large
gun
strapped
to
his
waist
warning
off
the
suitors
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
throngs
of
unarmed
federal
soldiers
from
across
the
river
swarmed
in
the
store
and
the
pool
hall
among
them
circulated
dark
ominous
persons
with
an
important
air
secret
agents
of
the
rebels
and
the
federals
around
in
the
brush
camped
hundreds
of
destitute
refugees
and
you
could
not
walk
around
a
corner
at
night
without
stumbling
over
a
plot
or
a
counterplot
there
were
texas
rangers
and
united
states
troopers
and
agents
of
american
corporations
trying
to
get
secret
instructions
to
their
employees
in
the
interior
one
mackenzie
stamped
about
the
post
office
in
a
high
dudgeon
it
appeared
that
he
had
important
letters
for
the
american
smelting
and
refining
company
mines
in
santa
eulalia
old
mercado
insists
on
opening
and
reading
all
letters
that
pass
through
his
lines
he
shouted
indignantly
but
i
said
he
will
let
them
pass
won
t
he
certainly
he
answered
but
do
you
think
the
american
smelting
and
refining
company
will
submit
to
having
its
letters
opened
and
read
by
a
damned
greaser
it
s
an
outrage
when
an
american
corporation
can
t
send
a
private
letter
to
its
employees
if
this
don
t
bring
intervention
he
finished
darkly
i
don
t
know
what
will
there
were
all
sorts
of
drummers
for
arms
and
ammunition
companies
smugglers
and
also
a
small
bantam
man
the
salesman
for
a
portrait
company
which
made
crayon
enlargements
from
photographs
at
apiece
he
was
scurrying
around
among
the
mexicans
getting
thousands
of
orders
for
pictures
which
were
to
be
paid
for
upon
delivery
and
which
of
course
could
never
be
delivered
it
was
his
first
experience
among
mexicans
and
he
was
highly
gratified
by
the
hundreds
of
orders
he
had
received
you
see
a
mexican
would
just
as
soon
order
a
portrait
or
a
piano
or
an
automobile
as
not
so
long
as
he
does
not
have
to
pay
for
it
it
gives
him
a
sense
of
wealth
the
little
agent
for
crayon
enlargements
made
one
comment
on
the
mexican
revolution
he
said
that
general
huerta
must
be
a
fine
man
because
he
understood
he
was
distantly
connected
on
his
mother
s
side
with
the
distinguished
carey
family
of
virginia
the
american
bank
of
the
river
was
patroled
twice
a
day
by
details
of
cavalry
conscientiously
paralleled
on
the
mexican
side
by
companies
of
horsemen
both
parties
watched
each
other
narrowly
across
the
border
every
once
in
a
while
a
mexican
unable
to
restrain
his
nervousness
took
a
at
the
americans
and
a
small
battle
ensued
as
both
parties
scattered
into
the
brush
a
little
way
above
presidio
were
stationed
two
troops
of
the
negro
ninth
cavalry
one
colored
trooper
watering
his
horse
on
the
bank
of
the
river
was
accosted
by
an
mexican
squatting
on
the
opposite
shore
hey
coon
he
shouted
derisively
when
are
you
damned
gringos
going
to
cross
that
line
chile
responded
the
negro
we
ain
t
agoin
to
cross
that
line
at
all
we
re
just
goin
to
pick
up
that
line
an
carry
it
right
down
to
the
big
ditch
sometimes
a
rich
refugee
with
a
good
deal
of
gold
sewed
in
his
would
get
across
the
river
without
the
federals
discovering
it
there
were
six
big
automobiles
in
presidio
waiting
for
just
such
a
victim
they
would
soak
him
one
hundred
dollars
gold
to
make
a
trip
to
the
railroad
and
on
the
way
somewhere
in
the
desolate
wastes
south
of
marfa
he
was
almost
sure
to
be
held
up
by
masked
men
and
everything
taken
away
from
him
upon
these
occasions
the
high
sheriff
of
presidio
county
would
bluster
into
town
on
a
small
pinto
horse
figure
true
to
the
best
tradition
of
the
girl
of
the
golden
west
he
had
read
all
owen
wister
s
novels
and
knew
what
a
western
sheriff
ought
to
look
like
two
revolvers
on
the
hip
one
slung
under
his
arm
a
large
knife
in
his
left
boot
and
an
enormous
shotgun
over
his
saddle
his
conversation
was
larded
with
the
most
fearful
oaths
and
he
never
caught
any
criminal
he
spent
all
of
his
time
enforcing
the
presidio
county
law
against
carrying
firearms
and
playing
poker
and
at
night
after
the
day
s
work
was
done
you
could
always
find
him
sitting
in
at
a
quiet
game
in
the
back
of
kleinmann
s
store
war
and
rumors
of
war
kept
presidio
at
a
fever
heat
we
all
knew
that
sooner
or
later
the
constitutionalist
army
would
come
overland
from
chihuahua
and
attack
ojinaga
in
fact
the
major
in
command
of
the
border
patrol
had
already
been
approached
by
the
federal
generals
in
a
body
to
make
arrangements
for
the
retreat
of
the
federal
army
from
ojinaga
under
such
circumstances
they
said
that
when
the
rebels
attacked
they
would
want
to
resist
for
a
respectable
length
of
time
two
hours
that
then
they
would
like
permission
to
come
across
the
river
we
knew
that
some
miles
southward
at
la
mula
pass
five
hundred
rebel
volunteers
guarded
the
only
road
from
ojinaga
through
the
mountains
one
day
a
courier
sneaked
through
the
federal
lines
and
across
the
river
with
important
news
he
said
that
the
military
band
of
the
federal
army
had
been
marching
around
the
country
practicing
their
music
and
had
been
captured
by
the
constitutionalists
who
stood
them
up
in
the
with
rifles
pointed
at
their
heads
and
made
them
play
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
thus
continued
the
message
the
hardships
of
life
in
the
desert
have
been
somewhat
alleviated
we
could
never
discover
just
how
it
was
that
the
band
happened
to
be
practicing
all
alone
miles
from
ojinaga
in
the
desert
for
a
month
longer
the
federals
remained
at
ojinaga
and
presidio
throve
then
villa
at
the
head
of
his
army
appeared
over
a
rise
of
the
desert
the
federals
resisted
a
respectable
length
of
two
hours
or
to
be
exact
until
villa
himself
at
the
head
of
a
battery
galloped
right
up
to
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
then
poured
across
the
river
in
wild
rout
were
herded
in
a
vast
corral
by
the
american
soldiers
and
afterward
imprisoned
in
a
stockade
at
fort
bliss
texas
but
by
that
time
i
was
already
far
down
in
mexico
riding
across
the
desert
with
a
hundred
ragged
constitutionalist
troopers
on
my
way
to
the
front
s
a
peddler
from
parral
came
into
town
with
a
of
smoke
when
you
can
t
get
tobacco
we
strolled
down
with
the
rest
of
the
population
to
get
the
news
this
was
in
magistral
a
durango
mountain
village
three
days
ride
from
the
railroad
somebody
bought
a
little
the
rest
of
us
borrowed
from
him
and
we
sent
a
boy
for
some
everybody
lit
up
squatting
around
the
peddler
three
deep
for
it
was
weeks
since
the
town
had
heard
of
the
revolution
he
was
full
of
the
most
alarming
rumors
that
the
federals
had
broken
out
of
torreon
and
were
headed
this
way
burning
ranches
and
murdering
that
the
united
states
troops
had
crossed
the
rio
grande
that
huerta
had
resigned
that
huerta
was
coming
north
to
take
charge
of
the
federal
troops
in
person
that
pascual
orozco
had
been
shot
at
ojinaga
that
pascual
orozco
was
coming
south
with
ten
thousand
he
retailed
these
reports
with
a
wealth
of
dramatic
gesture
stamping
around
until
his
heavy
sombrero
wabbled
on
his
head
tossing
his
faded
blue
blanket
over
his
shoulder
firing
imaginary
rifles
and
drawing
imaginary
swords
while
his
audience
murmured
and
but
the
most
interesting
rumor
was
that
general
urbina
would
leave
for
the
front
in
two
days
a
hostile
arab
named
antonio
swayfeta
happened
to
be
driving
to
parral
in
a
gig
the
next
morning
and
allowed
me
to
go
with
him
as
far
as
las
nieves
where
the
general
lives
by
afternoon
we
had
climbed
out
of
the
mountains
to
the
great
upland
plain
of
northern
durango
and
were
jogging
down
the
waves
of
yellow
prairie
stretching
away
so
far
that
the
grazing
cattle
dwindled
into
dots
and
finally
disappeared
at
the
base
of
the
wrinkled
purple
mountains
that
seemed
close
enough
to
hit
with
a
thrown
stone
the
arab
s
hostility
had
thawed
and
he
poured
out
his
life
s
story
not
one
word
of
which
i
could
understand
but
the
drift
of
it
i
gathered
was
largely
commercial
he
had
once
been
to
el
paso
and
regarded
it
as
the
world
s
most
beautiful
city
but
business
was
better
in
mexico
they
say
that
there
are
few
jews
in
mexico
because
they
can
not
stand
the
competition
of
the
arabs
we
passed
only
one
human
being
all
that
ragged
old
man
astride
a
burro
wrapped
in
a
checked
serape
though
without
trousers
and
hugging
the
broken
stock
of
a
rifle
spitting
he
volunteered
that
he
was
a
soldier
that
after
three
years
of
deliberation
he
had
finally
decided
to
join
the
revolution
and
fight
for
libertad
but
at
his
first
battle
a
cannon
had
been
fired
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
he
had
immediately
started
for
his
home
in
el
oro
where
he
intended
to
descend
into
a
and
stay
there
until
the
war
was
over
we
fell
silent
antonio
and
i
occasionally
he
addressed
the
mule
in
faultless
castilian
once
he
informed
me
that
that
mule
was
all
heart
the
sun
hung
for
a
moment
on
the
crest
of
the
red
porphyry
mountains
and
dropped
behind
them
the
turquoise
cup
of
sky
held
an
orange
powder
of
clouds
then
all
the
rolling
leagues
of
desert
glowed
and
came
near
in
the
soft
light
ahead
suddenly
reared
the
solid
fortress
of
a
big
rancho
such
as
one
comes
on
once
a
day
in
that
vast
land
mighty
square
of
blank
walls
with
towers
at
the
corners
and
an
gate
it
stood
grim
and
forbidding
upon
a
little
bare
hill
like
any
castle
its
adobe
corrals
around
it
and
below
in
what
had
been
a
dry
arroyo
all
day
the
sunken
river
came
to
the
surface
in
a
pool
and
disappeared
again
in
the
sand
thin
lines
of
smoke
from
within
rose
straight
into
the
high
last
sunshine
from
the
river
to
the
gate
moved
the
tiny
black
figures
of
women
with
on
their
heads
and
two
wild
horsemen
galloped
some
cattle
toward
the
corrals
now
the
western
mountains
were
blue
velvet
and
the
pale
sky
a
canopy
of
watered
silk
but
by
the
time
we
reached
the
great
gate
of
the
rancho
above
was
only
a
shower
of
stars
antonio
called
for
don
jesus
it
is
always
safe
to
call
for
don
jesus
at
a
rancho
for
that
is
invariably
the
name
he
finally
appeared
a
magnificently
tall
man
in
tight
trousers
purple
silk
undershirt
and
a
gray
sombrero
heavily
loaded
with
silver
braid
and
invited
us
in
the
inside
of
the
wall
consisted
of
houses
running
all
the
way
around
along
the
walls
and
over
the
doors
hung
festoons
of
jerked
meat
and
strings
of
peppers
and
drying
clothes
three
young
girls
crossed
the
square
in
single
file
balancing
of
water
on
their
heads
shouting
to
each
other
in
the
raucous
voices
of
mexican
women
at
one
house
a
woman
crouched
nursing
her
baby
next
door
another
kneeled
to
the
interminable
labor
of
grinding
in
a
stone
trough
the
squatted
before
little
fires
bundled
in
their
faded
serapes
smoking
their
as
they
watched
the
women
work
as
we
unharnessed
they
rose
and
gathered
around
with
curious
and
friendly
where
did
we
come
from
where
going
what
did
we
have
of
news
had
the
maderistas
taken
ojinaga
yet
was
it
true
that
orozco
was
coming
to
kill
the
did
we
know
panfilo
silveyra
he
was
a
one
of
urbina
s
men
he
came
from
that
house
was
the
cousin
of
this
man
ah
there
was
too
much
war
antonio
departed
to
bargain
for
corn
for
the
mule
a
a
little
corn
he
whined
surely
don
jesus
wouldn
t
charge
him
anything
just
so
much
corn
as
a
mule
could
eat
at
one
of
the
houses
i
negotiated
for
dinner
the
woman
spread
out
both
her
hands
we
are
all
so
poor
now
she
said
a
little
water
some
it
is
all
we
eat
in
this
house
milk
no
eggs
no
meat
no
coffee
no
i
ventured
that
with
this
money
they
might
be
purchased
at
one
of
the
other
houses
sabe
replied
she
dreamily
at
this
moment
arrived
the
husband
and
upbraided
her
for
her
lack
of
hospitality
my
house
is
at
your
orders
he
said
magnificently
and
begged
a
cigarette
then
he
squatted
down
while
she
brought
forward
the
two
family
chairs
and
bade
us
seat
ourselves
the
room
was
of
good
proportions
with
a
dirt
floor
and
a
ceiling
of
heavy
beams
the
adobe
showing
through
walls
and
ceiling
were
whitewashed
and
to
the
naked
eye
spotlessly
clean
in
one
corner
was
a
big
iron
bed
and
in
the
other
a
singer
sewing
machine
as
in
every
other
house
i
saw
in
mexico
there
was
also
a
table
upon
which
stood
a
of
our
lady
of
guadelupe
with
a
candle
burning
before
it
above
this
on
the
wall
hung
an
indecent
illustration
clipped
from
the
pages
of
in
a
an
object
of
the
highest
veneration
arrived
now
various
uncles
cousins
and
wondering
casually
if
we
dragged
any
cigarros
at
her
husband
s
command
the
woman
brought
a
live
coal
in
her
fingers
we
smoked
it
grew
late
there
developed
a
lively
argument
as
to
who
would
go
and
buy
provisions
for
our
dinner
finally
they
compromised
on
the
woman
and
soon
antonio
and
i
sat
in
the
kitchen
while
she
crouched
upon
the
adobe
platform
in
the
corner
cooking
over
the
open
fire
the
smoke
enveloped
up
pouring
out
the
door
occasionally
a
pig
or
a
few
hens
would
wander
in
from
the
outside
or
a
sheep
would
make
a
dash
for
the
meal
until
the
angry
voice
of
the
master
of
the
house
reminded
the
woman
that
she
was
not
doing
five
or
six
things
at
once
and
she
would
rise
wearily
and
belabor
the
animal
with
a
flaming
brand
all
through
our
meat
fiery
with
fried
eggs
and
bitter
black
coffee
entire
male
population
of
the
rancho
bore
us
company
in
the
room
and
out
it
seemed
that
some
were
especially
prejudiced
against
the
church
priests
without
shame
cried
one
who
come
when
we
are
so
poor
and
take
away
a
tenth
of
what
we
have
and
us
paying
a
quarter
to
the
government
for
this
cursed
war
shut
your
mouth
shrilled
the
woman
it
is
for
god
god
must
eat
the
same
as
we
her
husband
smiled
a
superior
smile
he
had
once
been
to
jimenez
and
was
considered
a
man
of
the
world
god
does
not
eat
he
remarked
with
finality
the
grow
fat
on
us
why
do
you
give
it
i
asked
it
is
the
law
said
several
at
once
and
not
one
would
believe
that
that
law
was
repealed
in
mexico
in
the
year
i
asked
them
about
general
urbina
a
good
man
all
heart
and
another
he
is
very
brave
the
bullets
bound
off
him
like
rain
from
a
sombrero
he
is
the
cousin
of
my
woman
s
first
husband
s
sister
he
is
para
los
negocios
del
that
is
to
say
he
is
a
highly
successful
bandit
and
highwayman
and
finally
one
said
proudly
a
few
years
ago
he
was
just
a
peon
like
us
and
now
he
is
a
general
and
a
rich
man
but
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
body
and
bare
feet
of
an
old
man
with
the
face
of
a
saint
who
said
slowly
the
revolucion
is
good
when
it
is
done
we
shall
starve
never
never
never
if
god
is
served
but
it
is
long
and
we
have
no
food
to
eat
or
clothes
to
wear
for
the
master
has
gone
away
from
the
hacienda
and
we
have
no
tools
or
animals
to
do
our
work
with
and
the
soldiers
take
all
our
corn
and
drive
away
the
cattle
why
don
t
the
fight
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
now
they
do
not
need
us
they
have
no
rifles
for
us
or
horses
they
are
winning
and
who
shall
feed
them
if
we
do
not
plant
corn
no
señor
but
if
the
revolucion
loses
then
there
will
be
no
more
then
we
will
rise
with
our
knives
and
our
horsewhips
the
revolucion
will
not
lose
as
antonio
and
i
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
on
the
floor
of
the
granary
they
were
singing
one
of
the
young
bucks
had
procured
a
guitar
somewhere
and
two
voices
clinging
to
each
other
in
that
peculiar
strident
mexican
harmony
were
whining
loudly
something
about
a
historia
d
the
rancho
was
one
of
many
belonging
to
the
hacienda
of
el
canotillo
and
all
next
day
we
drove
through
its
wide
lands
which
covered
more
than
two
million
acres
i
was
told
the
a
wealthy
spaniard
had
fled
the
country
two
years
before
who
is
owner
now
general
urbina
said
antonio
and
it
was
so
as
i
soon
saw
the
great
haciendas
of
northern
durango
an
area
greater
than
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
been
confiscated
for
the
constitutionalist
government
by
the
general
who
ruled
them
with
his
own
agents
and
it
was
said
divided
with
the
revolution
we
drove
steadily
all
day
only
stopping
long
enough
to
eat
a
few
and
along
about
sundown
we
saw
the
brown
mud
wall
that
hemmed
el
canotillo
round
with
its
city
of
little
houses
and
the
ancient
pink
tower
of
its
church
among
the
alamo
trees
away
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
the
village
of
las
nieves
a
straggling
collection
of
adobes
the
exact
color
of
the
earth
of
which
they
are
built
lay
before
us
like
some
strange
growth
of
the
desert
a
flashing
river
without
a
trace
of
green
along
its
banks
to
contrast
it
with
the
scorched
plain
made
a
around
the
town
and
as
we
splashed
across
the
ford
between
the
women
kneeling
there
at
their
washing
the
sun
suddenly
went
behind
the
western
mountains
immediately
a
deluge
of
yellow
light
thick
as
water
drowned
the
earth
and
a
golden
mist
rose
from
the
ground
in
which
the
cattle
floated
legless
i
knew
that
the
price
for
such
a
journey
as
antonio
had
carried
me
was
at
least
ten
pesos
and
he
was
an
arab
to
boot
but
when
i
offered
him
money
he
threw
his
arms
around
me
and
burst
into
tears
god
bless
you
excellent
arab
you
are
right
business
is
better
in
mexico
lion
of
durango
at
at
general
urbina
s
door
sat
an
old
peon
with
four
around
him
engaged
in
the
genial
occupation
of
filling
corrugated
iron
bombs
with
gunpowder
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
patio
the
general
s
house
corrals
and
storerooms
ran
around
all
four
sides
of
a
space
as
big
as
a
city
block
swarming
with
pigs
chickens
and
children
two
goats
and
three
magnificent
peacocks
gazed
pensively
down
from
the
roof
in
and
out
of
the
whence
came
the
phonographic
strains
of
the
dollar
princess
stalked
a
train
of
hens
an
old
woman
came
from
the
kitchen
and
dumped
a
bucket
of
garbage
on
the
ground
all
the
pigs
made
a
squealing
rush
for
it
in
a
corner
of
the
sat
the
general
s
baby
daughter
chewing
on
a
cartridge
a
group
of
men
stood
or
sprawled
on
the
ground
around
a
well
in
the
center
of
the
patio
the
general
himself
sat
in
their
midst
in
a
broken
wicker
feeding
to
a
tame
deer
and
a
lame
black
sheep
before
him
kneeled
a
peon
pouring
from
a
canvas
sack
some
hundreds
of
mauser
cartridges
to
my
explanations
the
general
returned
no
answer
he
gave
me
a
limp
hand
immediately
withdrawing
it
but
did
not
rise
a
broad
man
of
dark
mahogany
complexion
with
a
sparse
black
beard
up
to
his
that
didn
t
hide
the
wide
thin
expressionless
mouth
the
gaping
nostrils
the
shiny
small
humorous
animal
eyes
for
a
good
five
minutes
he
never
took
them
from
mine
i
produced
my
papers
i
don
t
know
how
to
read
said
the
general
suddenly
motioning
to
his
secretary
so
you
want
to
go
with
me
to
battle
he
shot
at
me
in
the
coarsest
spanish
many
bullets
i
said
nothing
but
i
don
t
know
when
i
shall
go
maybe
in
five
days
now

thanks
my
general
i
ve

and

he
repeated
calmly
a
dirty
little
man
they
all
called
doctor
escorted
me
to
the
he
had
once
been
an
apothecary
in
parral
but
was
now
a
major
we
were
to
sleep
together
that
night
he
said
but
before
we
reached
the
there
was
a
shout
of
doctor
a
wounded
man
had
arrived
a
peasant
with
his
sombrero
in
his
hand
and
a
handkerchief
around
his
head
the
little
doctor
became
all
efficiency
he
dispatched
a
boy
for
the
family
scissors
another
for
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
well
he
sharpened
with
his
knife
a
stick
he
picked
up
from
the
ground
seating
the
man
on
a
box
he
took
off
the
bandage
revealing
a
cut
about
two
inches
long
caked
with
dirt
and
dried
blood
first
he
cut
off
the
hair
around
the
wound
jabbing
the
points
of
the
scissors
carelessly
into
it
the
man
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
but
did
not
move
then
the
doctor
slowly
the
clotted
blood
away
from
the
whistling
cheerfully
to
himself
yes
he
remarked
it
is
an
interesting
life
the
doctor
s
he
peered
closely
at
the
vomiting
blood
the
peasant
sat
like
a
sick
stone
and
it
is
a
life
full
of
nobility
continued
the
doctor
alleviating
the
sufferings
of
others
here
he
picked
up
the
sharpened
stick
thrust
it
deep
in
slowly
worked
it
the
entire
length
of
the
pah
the
animal
has
fainted
said
the
doctor
here
hold
him
up
while
i
wash
it
with
that
he
lifted
the
bucket
and
poured
its
contents
over
the
head
of
the
patient
the
water
and
blood
dribbling
down
over
his
clothes
these
ignorant
peons
said
the
doctor
binding
up
the
wound
in
its
original
bandage
have
no
courage
it
is
the
intelligence
that
makes
the
soul
eh
when
the
peasant
came
to
i
asked
are
you
a
soldier
the
man
smiled
a
sweet
deprecating
smile
no
señor
i
am
only
a

said
i
live
in
the
canotillo
where
my
house

your
orders

time

down
to
supper
there
was
pablo
seañes
a
frank
engaging
youth
of
with
five
bullets
in
him
to
pay
for
the
three
years
fighting
his
conversation
was
sprinkled
with
soldierly
curses
and
his
pronunciation
was
a
little
indistinct
the
result
of
a
bullet
on
the
and
a
tongue
almost
cut
in
two
by
a
sword
he
was
a
demon
in
the
field
they
said
and
a
killer
after
it
at
the
first
taking
of
torreon
pablo
and
two
other

them
down
with
his
revolver
until
his
hand
got
tired
pulling
the
trigger
pablo
said
where

institute

the
study
of
hypnotism
in
the
united
states

soon
as
this
cursed
war

to
study
to
become
a
hypnotist
with
that
he
turned
and
began
to
make
passes
at
lieutenant
borrega
who
was
called
derisively
the
lion
of
the
sierras
because
of
his
prodigious
boasting
the
latter
jerked
out
his
revolver
i
want
no
business
with
the
devil
he
screamed
amid
the
uproarious
laughter
of
the
others
then
there
was
captain
fernando
a
grizzled
giant
of
a
man
in
tight
trousers
who
had
fought
battles
he
took
the
keenest
delight
in
my
fragmentary
spanish
and
every
word
i
spoke
sent
him
into
bellows
of
laughter
that
shook
down
the
adobe
from
the
ceiling
he
had
never
been
out
of
durango
and
declared
that
there
was
a
great
sea
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
and
that
he
believed
all
the
rest
of
the
earth
to
be
water
next
to
him
sat
longinos
güereca
with
a
row
of
decayed
teeth
across
his
round
gentle
face
every
time
he
smiled
and
a
record
for
simple
bravery
that
was
famous
throughout
the
army
he
was
and
already
first
captain
he
told
me
that
last
night
his
own
men
had
tried
to
kill
him
then
came
patricio
the
best
rider
of
wild
horses
in
the
state
and
fidencio
next
to
him
a
indian
seven
feet
tall
who
always
fought
standing
up
and
last
raphael
zalarzo
a
tiny
hunchback
that
urbina
carried
in
his
train
to
amuse
him
like
any
medieval
italian
duke
when
we
had
burned
our
throats
with
the
last
enchilada
and
scooped
up
our
last
with
a
and
spoons
being
unknown
gentlemen
each
took
a
mouthful
of
water
gargled
it
and
spat
it
on
the
floor
as
i
came
out
into
the
patio
i
saw
the
figure
of
the
general
emerge
from
his
bedroom
door
staggering
slightly
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
revolver
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
light
of
another
door
then
suddenly
went
in
banging
it
behind
him
i
was
already
in
bed
when
the
doctor
came
into
the
room
in
the
other
bed
reposed
the
lion
of
the
sierras
and
his
momentary
mistress
now
loudly
snoring
yes
said
the
doctor
there
has
been
some
little
trouble
the
general
has
not
been
able
to
walk
for
two
months
from
rheumatism
and
sometimes
he
is
in
great
pain
and
comforts
himself
with
he
tried
to
shoot
his
mother
he
always
tries
to
shoot
his
mother
because
he
loves
her
very
much
the
doctor
peeped
at
himself
in
the
mirror
and
twisted
his
mustache
this
revolucion
do
not
mistake
it
is
a
fight
of
the
poor
against
the
rich
i
was
very
poor
before
the
revolucion
and
now
i
am
very
rich
he
pondered
a
moment
and
then
began
removing
his
clothes
through
his
filthy
undershirt
the
doctor
honored
me
with
his
one
english
sentence
i
have
mooch
lices
he
said
with
a
proud
smile
i
went
out
at
dawn
and
walked
around
las
nieves
the
town
belongs
to
general
urbina
people
houses
animals
and
immortal
souls
at
las
nieves
he
and
he
alone
wields
the
high
justice
and
the
low
the
town
s
only
store
is
in
his
house
and
i
bought
some
cigarettes
from
the
lion
of
the
sierras
who
was
detailed
for
the
day
in
the
patio
the
general
was
talking
with
his
mistress
a
beautiful
woman
with
a
voice
like
a
when
he
noticed
me
he
came
up
and
shook
hands
saying
that
he
d
like
to
have
me
take
some
pictures
of
him
i
said
that
that
was
my
purpose
in
life
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
would
leave
soon
for
the
front
in
about
ten
days
i
think
he
answered
i
began
to
get
uncomfortable
i
appreciate
your
hospitality
my
general
i
told
him
but
my
work
demands
that
i
be
where
i
can
see
the
actual
advance
upon
torreon
if
it
is
convenient
i
should
like
to
go
back
to
chihuahua
and
join
general
villa
who
will
soon
go
south
urbina
s
expression
didn
t
change
but
he
shot
at
me
what
is
it
that
you
don
t
like
here
you
are
in
your
own
house
do
you
want
cigarettes
do
you
want
or
or
cognac
do
you
want
a
woman
to
warm
your
bed
at
night
everything
you
want
i
can
give
you
do
you
want
a
pistol
a
horse
do
you
want
money
he
jerked
a
handful
of
silver
dollars
from
his
pocket
and
threw
them
jingling
on
the
ground
at
my
feet
i
said
nowhere
in
mexico
am
i
so
happy
and
contented
as
in
this
house
and
i
was
prepared
to
go
further
for
the
next
hour
i
took
photographs
of
general
urbina
general
urbina
on
foot
with
and
without

on
three
different
horses

and
off

and
his

the
entire
family
armed
with
swords
and
revolvers
including
the

for
the
purpose
one
of
the
children
holding
a
placard
upon
which
was
inked

urbina
general
goes
to
we
had
finished
breakfast
and
i
was
resigning
myself
to
the
ten
days
in
las
nieves
when
the
general
suddenly
changed
his
mind
he
came
out
of
his
room
roaring
orders
in
five
minutes
the
house
was
all
bustle
and
confusion
rushing
to
pack
their
serapes
and
troopers
saddling
horses
peons
with
armfuls
of
rifles
rushing
to
and
fro
patricio
harnessed
five
mules
to
the
great
coach
exact
copy
of
the
deadwood
stage
a
courier
rode
out
on
the
run
to
summon
the
tropa
which
was
quartered
at
the
canotillo
rafaelito
loaded
the
general
s
baggage
into
the
coach
it
consisted
of
a
typewriter
four
swords
one
of
them
bearing
the
emblem
of
the
knights
of
pythias
three
uniforms
the
general
s
and
a
demijohn
of
and
there
came
the
tropa
a
ragged
smoke
of
brown
dust
miles
along
the
road
ahead
flew
a
little
squat
black
figure
with
the
mexican
flag
streaming
over
him
he
wore
a
floppy
sombrero
loaded
with
five
pounds
of
tarnished
gold
braid
probably
the
pride
of
some
imperial
following
him
closely
were
manuel
paredes
with
riding
boots
up
to
his
hips
fastened
with
silver
buckles
the
size
of
dollars
beating
his
mount
with
the
flat
of
a
saber

making
his

around
his

julian

with
colored
pictures
of

and
the

fastened
to
the
front
of
his
sombrero
a
struggling
tangle
of
six
behind
with
antonio
guzman
trying
to
lasso
them
the
coils
of
his
horsehair
rope
soaring
out
of
the
dust
they
came
on
the
dead
run
all
indian
shouts
and
cracking
revolvers
until
they
were
only
a
hundred
feet
away
then
jerked
their
little
cruelly
to
a
staggering
halt
with
bleeding
mouths
a
whirling
confusion
of
men
horses
and
dust
this
was
the
tropa
when
i
first
saw
them
about
a
hundred
they
were
in
all
stages
of
picturesque
raggedness
some
wore
overalls
others
the
charro
jackets
of
peons
while
one
or
two
sported
tight
vaquero
trousers
a
few
had
shoes
most
of
them
only
cowhide
sandals
and
the
rest
were
barefooted
sabas
gutierrez
was
garbed
in
an
ancient
frockcoat
split
up
the
back
for
riding
rifles
slung
at
their
saddles
four
or
five
crossed
over
their
chests
high
flapping
sombreros
immense
spurs
chiming
as
they
rode
serapes
strapped
on
was
their
uniform
the
general
was
with
his
mother
outside
the
door
crouched
his
mistress
weeping
her
three
children
around
her
for
almost
an
hour
we
waited
then
urbina
suddenly
burst
out
of
the
door
with
scarcely
a
look
at
his
family
he
leaped
on
his
great
gray
charger
and
spurred
furiously
into
the
street
juan
sanchez
blew
a
blast
on
his
cracked
bugle
and
the
tropa
with
the
general
at
its
head
took
the
canotillo
road
in
the
meanwhile
patricio
and
i
loaded
three
cases
of
dynamite
and
a
case
of
bombs
into
the
boot
of
the
coach
i
got
up
beside
patricio
the
peons
let
go
of
the
mules
heads
and
the
long
whip
curled
around
their
bellies
galloping
we
whirled
out
of
the
village
and
took
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
at
twenty
miles
an
hour
away
on
the
other
side
the
tropa
trotted
along
a
more
direct
road
the
canotillo
we
passed
without
stopping
mulas
putas
hijas
de
la
yelled
patricio
the
whip
hissing
the
was
a
mere
track
on
uneven
ground
every
time
we
took
a
little
arroyo
the
dynamite
came
down
with
a
sickening
crash
suddenly
a
rope
broke
and
one
case
bounced
off
the
coach
and
fell
upon
rocks
it
was
a
cool
morning
however
and
we
strapped
it
on
again
safely
almost
every
hundred
yards
along
the
road
were
little
heaps
of
stones
surmounted
by
wooden
crosses
one
the
memorial
of
a
murder
and
occasionally
a
tall
whitewashed
cross
uprose
in
the
middle
of
a
to
protect
some
little
desert
rancho
from
the
visits
of
the
devil
black
shiny
chaparral
the
height
of
a
mule
s
back
scraped
the
side
of
the
coach
spanish
bayonet
and
the
great
watched
us
like
sentinels
from
the
skyline
of
the
desert
and
always
the
mighty
mexican
vultures
circled
over
us
as
if
they
knew
we
were
going
to
war
late
in
the
afternoon
the
stone
wall
which
bounds
the
million
acres
of
the
hacienda
of
torreon
de
cañas
swung
into
sight
on
our
left
marching
across
deserts
and
mountains
like
the
great
wall
of
china
for
more
than
thirty
miles
and
soon
afterward
the
hacienda
itself
the
tropa
had
dismounted
around
the
big
house
they
said
that
general
urbina
had
suddenly
been
taken
violently
sick
and
would
probably
be
unable
to
leave
his
bed
for
a
week
the
casa
grande
a
magnificent
porticoed
palace
but
one
story
high
covered
the
entire
top
of
a
desert
rise
from
its
doorway
one
could
see
fifteen
miles
of
yellow
rolling
plain
and
beyond
the
interminable
ranges
of
bare
mountains
piled
upon
each
other
back
of
it
lay
the
great
corrals
and
stables
where
the
tropa
s
evening
fires
already
sent
up
myriad
columns
of
yellow
smoke
below
in
the
hollow
more
than
a
hundred
peons
houses
made
a
vast
open
square
where
children
and
animals
romped
together
and
the
women
kneeled
at
their
eternal
grinding
of
corn
out
on
the
desert
a
troop
of
rode
slowly
home
and
from
the
river
a
mile
away
the
endless
chain
of
women
carried
water
on
their
heads
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
how
close
to
nature
the
peons
live
on
these
great
haciendas
their
very
houses
are
built
of
the
earth
upon
which
they
stand
baked
by
the
sun
their
food
is
the
corn
they
grow
their
drink
the
water
from
the
dwindled
river
carried
painfully
upon
their
heads
the
clothes
they
wear
are
spun
from
the
wool
and
their
sandals
cut
from
the
hide
of
a
newly
slaughtered
steer
the
animals
are
their
constant
companions
familiars
of
their
houses
light
and
darkness
are
their
day
and
night
when
a
man
and
a
woman
fall
in
love
they
fly
to
each
other
without
the
formalities
of
a
courtship
when
they
are
tired
of
each
other
they
simply
part
marriage
is
very
costly
six
pesos
to
the
priest
and
is
considered
a
very
swagger
extra
but
it
is
no
more
binding
than
the
most
casual
attachment
and
of
course
jealousy
is
a
stabbing
matter
we
dined
in
one
of
the
lofty
barren
of
the
casa
grande
a
room
with
a
ceiling
eighteen
feet
high
and
walls
of
noble
proportions
covered
with
cheap
american
wallpaper
a
gigantic
mahogany
sideboard
occupied
one
side
of
the
place
but
we
had
no
knives
and
forks
there
was
a
tiny
fireplace
in
which
a
fire
was
never
lighted
yet
the
chill
of
death
abode
there
day
and
night
the
room
next
door
was
hung
with
heavy
spotted
brocade
though
there
was
no
rug
on
the
concrete
floor
no
pipes
and
no
plumbing
in
all
the
house
went
to
the
well
or
the
river
for
water
and
candles
the
only
light
of
course
the
had
long
fled
the
country
but
the
hacienda
in
its
prime
must
have
been
as
splendid
and
as
uncomfortable
as
a
medieval
castle
the
or
priest
of
the
hacienda
church
presided
at
dinner
to
him
were
brought
the
choicest
viands
which
he
sometimes
passed
to
his
favorites
after
helping
himself
we
drank
and
while
the
made
away
with
a
whole
bottle
of
looted
anisette
exhilarated
by
this
his
reverence
descanted
upon
the
virtues
of
the
confessional
especially
where
young
girls
were
concerned
he
also
made
us
understand
that
he
possessed
certain
feudal
rights
over
new
brides
the
girls
here
he
said
are
very
passionate
i
noticed
that
the
rest
didn
t
laugh
much
at
this
though
they
were
outwardly
respectful
after
we
were
out
of
the
room
josé
valiente
hissed
shaking
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
i
know
the
dirty
and
my
sister
the
revolucion
will
have
something
to
say
about
these
two
high
constitutionalist
officers
afterward
hinted
at
a
program
to
drive
the
priests
out
of
mexico
and
villa
s
hostility
to
the
is
well
known
patricio
was
harnessing
the
coach
when
i
came
out
in
the
morning
and
the
tropa
were
saddling
up
the
doctor
who
was
remaining
with
the
general
strolled
up
to
my
friend
trooper
juan
vallejo
that
s
a
pretty
horse
you
ve
got
there
he
said
and
a
nice
rifle
lend
them
to
me
but
i
haven
t
any
began
juan
i
am
your
superior
officer
returned
the
doctor
and
that
was
the
last
we
ever
saw
of
doctor
horse
and
rifle
i
said
farewell
to
the
general
who
was
lying
in
torture
in
bed
sending
bulletins
to
his
mother
by
telephone
every
fifteen
minutes
may
you
journey
happily
he
said
write
the
truth
i
commend
you
to
pablito
tropa
on
the
and
so
i
got
inside
the
coach
with
rafaelito
pablo
seañes
and
his
mistress
she
was
a
strange
creature
young
slender
and
beautiful
she
was
poison
and
a
stone
to
everybody
but
pablo
i
never
saw
her
smile
and
never
heard
her
say
a
gentle
word
sometimes
she
treated
us
with
dull
ferocity
sometimes
with
bestial
indifference
but
pablo
she
cradled
like
a
baby
when
he
lay
across
the
seat
with
his
head
in
her
lap
she
would
hug
it
fiercely
to
her
breast
making
noises
like
a
tigress
with
her
young
patricio
handed
down
his
guitar
from
the
box
where
he
kept
it
and
to
rafael
s
accompaniment
the
sang
in
a
cracked
voice
every
mexican
knows
hundreds
of
these
they
are
not
written
down
but
often
composed
extemporaneously
and
handed
along
by
word
of
mouth
some
of
them
are
very
beautiful
some
grotesque
and
others
as
satirical
as
any
french
popular
song
he
sang
exiled
i
wandered
through
the
by
the
came
back
at
the
end
of
the
year
by
the
fondness
of
went
away
with
the
staying
away
the
love
of
a
woman
was
the
only
made
me
come
back
and
then
hijos
de
la
i
am
of
the
children
of
the
wander
aimlessly
in
the
beautiful
moon
with
its
golden
the
companion
of
my
i
am
going
to
lose
myself
from
thee
with
weeping
am
going
sailing
sailing
the
shores
of
the
you
will
see
at
the
time
of
our
will
not
allow
you
to
love
if
so
it
should
be
i
would
ruin
your
many
blows
we
would
give
one
so
i
am
going
to
become
an
with
god
farewell
to
my
may
the
americans
allow
me
to
open
a
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
hacienda
of
el
centro
turned
out
to
give
us
lunch
and
there
fidencio
offered
me
his
horse
to
ride
for
the
afternoon
the
tropa
had
already
ridden
on
ahead
and
i
could
see
them
strung
out
for
half
a
mile
in
the
black
mesquite
brush
the
tiny
flag
bobbing
at
their
head
the
mountains
had
withdrawn
somewhere
beyond
the
horizon
and
we
rode
in
the
midst
of
a
great
bowl
of
desert
rolling
up
at
the
edges
to
meet
the
of
the
mexican
sky
now
that
i
was
out
of
the
coach
a
great
silence
and
a
peace
beyond
anything
i
ever
felt
wrapped
me
around
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
objective
about
the
desert
you
sink
into
it
a
part
of
it
galloping
along
i
soon
caught
up
with
the
tropa
aye
meester
they
shouted
here
comes
meester
on
a
horse
meester
how
goes
it
are
you
going
to
fight
with
us
but
captain
fernando
at
the
head
of
the
column
turned
and
roared
come
here
meester
the
big
man
was
grinning
with
delight
you
shall
ride
with
me
he
shouted
clapping
me
on
the
back
drink
now
and
he
produced
a
bottle
of
about
half
full
drink
it
all
show
you
re
a
man
it
s
too
much
i
laughed
drink
it
yelled
the
chorus
as
the
tropa
crowded
up
to
see
i
drank
it
a
howl
of
laughter
and
applause
went
up
fernando
leaned
over
and
gripped
my
hand
good
for
you
he
bellowed
rolling
with
mirth
the
men
crowded
around
amused
and
interested
was
i
going
to
fight
with
them
where
did
i
come
from
what
was
i
doing
most
of
them
had
never
heard
of
reporters
and
one
hazarded
the
opinion
darkly
that
i
was
a
gringo
and
a
porfirista
and
ought
to
be
shot
the
rest
however
were
entirely
opposed
to
this
view
no
porfirista
would
possibly
drink
that
much
at
a
gulp
isidro
amayo
declared
that
he
had
been
in
a
brigade
in
the
first
revolution
which
was
accompanied
by
a
reporter
and
that
he
was
called
de
did
i
like
mexico
i
said
i
am
very
fond
of
mexico
i
like
mexicans
too
and
i
like
and
other
mexican
customs
they
shouted
with
laughter
captain
fernando
leaned
over
and
patted
my
arm
now
you
are
with
the
men
when
we
win
the
revolucion
it
will
be
a
government
by
the
men
by
the
rich
we
are
riding
over
the
lands
of
the
men
they
used
to
belong
to
the
rich
but
now
they
belong
to
me
and
to
the
and
you
will
be
the
army
i
asked
when
the
revolucion
is
won
was
the
astonishing
reply
there
will
be
no
more
army
the
men
are
sick
of
armies
it
is
by
armies
that
don
porfirio
robbed
us
but
if
the
united
states
should
invade
mexico
a
perfect
storm
broke
everywhere
we
are
more
than
the
cursed
gringos
would
get
no
further
south
than
s
see
them
try
d
drive
them
back
over
the
border
on
the
run
and
burn
their
capital
the
next
day
no
said
fernando
you
have
more
money
and
more
soldiers
but
the
men
would
protect
us
we
need
no
army
the
men
would
be
fighting
for
their
houses
and
their
women
what
are
you
fighting
for
i
asked
juan
sanchez
the
looked
at
me
curiously
why
it
is
good
fighting
you
don
t
have
to
work
in
the
mines
manuel
paredes
said
we
are
fighting
to
restore
francisco
madero
to
the
presidency
this
extraordinary
statement
is
printed
in
the
program
of
the
revolution
and
everywhere
the
constitutionalist
soldiers
are
known
as
maderistas
i
knew
him
continued
manuel
slowly
he
was
always
laughing
always
yes
said
another
whenever
there
was
any
trouble
with
a
man
and
all
the
rest
wanted
to
fight
him
or
put
him
in
prison
pancho
madero
said
just
let
me
talk
to
him
a
few
minutes
i
can
bring
him
he
loved
an
indian
said
many
a
time
i
ve
seen
him
dance
all
night
and
all
the
next
day
and
the
next
night
he
used
to
come
to
the
great
haciendas
and
make
speeches
when
he
began
the
peons
hated
him
when
he
ended
they
were
crying
here
a
man
broke
out
into
a
droning
irregular
tune
such
as
always
accompanies
the
popular
ballads
that
spring
up
in
thousands
on
every
occasion
in
nineteen
hundred
and
was
the
national
eighteenth
of
four
days
he
was
the
hall
of
the
he
did
not
renounce
the
then
blanquet
and
felix
him
were
the
on
his
they
crushed
he
play
of
make
him
then
with
hot
burned
him
without
only
the
awful
but
it
was
all
in
his
mighty
rather
to
was
a
great
heart
this
was
the
end
of
the
him
who
was
the
the
indian
of
all
the
they
took
him
out
of
the
tell
us
he
was
killed
in
an
a
cynicism
a
shameless
lie
o
street
of
cheerfulness
has
ended
through
you
passed
the
that
of
always
be
remembered
in
the
indian
has
pardoned
the
virgin
of
beautiful
our
leader
to
the
he
issued
a
living
señores
there
is
nothing
anything
sincere
in
what
happened
to
don
francisco
madero
by
the
time
he
was
through
the
entire
tropa
was
humming
the
tune
and
when
he
finished
there
was
a
moment
of
jingling
silence
we
are
fighting
said
isidro
amayo
for
libertad
what
do
you
mean
by
libertad
libertad
is
when
i
can
what
i
but
suppose
it
hurts
somebody
else
he
shot
back
at
me
benito
juarez
great
sentence
peace
is
the
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
i
wasn
t
prepared
for
that
it
startled
me
this
barefooted
conception
of
liberty
i
submit
that
it
is
the
only
correct
definition
of
do
what
i
want
americans
quote
it
to
me
triumphantly
as
an
instance
of
mexican
irresponsibility
but
i
think
it
is
a
better
definition
than
is
the
right
to
do
what
the
courts
want
every
mexican
schoolboy
knows
the
definition
of
peace
and
seems
to
understand
pretty
well
what
it
means
too
but
they
say
mexicans
don
t
want
peace
that
is
a
lie
and
a
foolish
one
let
americans
take
the
trouble
to
go
through
the
maderista
army
asking
whether
they
want
peace
or
not
the
people
are
sick
of
war
but
just
to
be
square
i
ll
have
to
report
juan
sanchez
remark
is
there
war
in
the
united
states
now
he
asked
no
i
said
untruthfully
no
war
at
all
he
meditated
for
a
moment
how
do
you
pass
the
time
then
just
about
then
somebody
saw
a
coyote
sneaking
through
the
brush
and
the
entire
tropa
gave
chase
with
a
whoop
they
scattered
rollicking
over
the
desert
the
late
sun
flashing
from
and
spurs
the
ends
of
their
bright
serapes
flying
out
behind
beyond
them
the
scorched
world
sloped
gently
up
and
a
range
of
far
lilac
mountains
jumped
in
the
heat
waves
like
a
bucking
horse
by
here
if
tradition
is
right
passed
the
spaniards
in
their
search
for
gold
a
blaze
of
crimson
and
silver
that
has
left
the
desert
cold
and
dull
ever
since
and
topping
a
rise
we
came
upon
the
first
sight
of
the
hacienda
of
la
mimbrera
a
walled
enclosure
of
houses
strong
enough
to
stand
a
siege
stretching
steeply
down
a
hill
with
the
magnificent
casa
grande
at
the
top
in
front
of
this
house
which
had
been
sacked
and
burned
by
orozco
s
general
che
che
campa
two
years
before
the
coach
was
drawn
up
a
huge
fire
had
been
kindled
and
ten
were
slaughtering
sheep
into
the
red
glare
of
the
firelight
they
staggered
with
the
struggling
squealing
sheep
in
their
arms
its
blood
fountaining
upon
the
ground
shining
in
the
fierce
light
like
something
phosphorescent
the
officers
and
i
dined
in
the
house
of
the
don
jesus
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
manhood
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
much
over
six
feet
tall
slender
pure
spanish
type
of
the
highest
breed
at
one
end
of
his
i
remember
hung
a
placard
embroidered
in
red
white
and
green
viva
mexico
and
at
the
other
a
second
which
read
viva
jesus
it
was
after
dinner
as
i
stood
at
the
fire
wondering
where
i
was
to
sleep
that
captain
fernando
touched
me
on
the
arm
will
you
sleep
with
the
we
walked
across
the
great
open
square
in
the
furious
light
of
the
desert
stars
to
a
stone
set
apart
inside
a
few
candles
stuck
against
the
wall
illumined
the
rifles
stacked
in
the
corners
the
saddles
on
the
floor
and
the
with
their
heads
on
them
one
or
two
were
awake
talking
and
smoking
in
a
corner
three
sat
muffled
in
their
serapes
playing
cards
five
or
six
had
voices
and
a
guitar
they
were
singing
pascual
orozco
beginning
they
say
that
pascual
orozco
has
turned
his
don
terrazzas
seduced
him
gave
him
many
millions
and
they
bought

dinner
and
put
the
cloth
on
the
table
they
didn
t
distinguish
me
at
first
but
soon
one
of
the
said
here
comes
meester
at
that
the
others
roused
and
woke
the
rest
that
s
s
good
to
sleep
with
the
this
place
s
my
there
is
no
a
man
goes
straight
may
you
pass
a
happy
night
they
said
till
morning
then
pretty
soon
somebody
shut
the
door
the
room
became
full
of
smoke
and
fetid
with
human
breath
what
little
silence
was
left
from
the
chorus
of
snoring
was
entirely
obliterated
by
the
singing
which
kept
up
i
guess
until
dawn
the
had
fleas
but
i
rolled
up
in
my
blankets
and
lay
down
upon
the
concrete
floor
very
happily
and
i
slept
better
than
i
had
before
in
mexico
at
dawn
we
were
in
the
saddle
larking
up
a
steep
roll
of
barren
desert
to
get
warm
it
was
bitter
cold
the
tropa
were
wrapped
in
serapes
up
to
their
eyes
so
that
they
looked
like
colored
toadstools
under
their
great
sombreros
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
burning
as
they
fell
upon
my
face
caught
them
unaware
glorifying
the
serapes
to
more
brilliant
colors
than
they
possessed
isidro
amayo
s
was
of
deep
blue
and
yellow
spirals
juan
sanchez
had
one
brick
red
captain
fernando
s
was
green
and
cerise
against
them
flashed
a
purple
and
black
zigzag
pattern
we
looked
back
to
see
the
coach
pulled
to
a
stop
and
patricio
waving
to
us
two
of
the
mules
had
given
out
raw
from
the
traces
and
tottering
with
the
fatigue
of
the
last
two
days
the
tropa
scattered
to
look
for
mules
soon
they
came
back
driving
two
great
beautiful
animals
that
had
never
seen
harness
no
sooner
had
they
smelled
the
coach
than
they
made
a
desperate
break
for
freedom
and
now
the
tropa
instantly
went
back
to
their
native
became
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
swinging
in
the
air
the
sudden
shoot
of
the
loops
the
little
horses
bracing
themselves
against
the
shock
of
the
running
mule
those
mules
were
demons
time
after
time
they
broke
the
twice
they
overturned
horse
and
rider
pablo
came
to
the
rescue
he
got
on
sabas
s
horse
drove
in
the
spurs
and
went
after
one
mule
in
three
minutes
he
had
roped
him
by
the
leg
thrown
him
and
tied
him
then
he
took
the
second
with
equal
dispatch
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
pablo
was
at
not
only
could
he
fight
better
than
his
men
but
he
could
ride
better
rope
better
shoot
better
chop
wood
better
and
dance
better
the
mules
legs
were
tied
and
they
were
dragged
with
ropes
to
the
coach
where
the
harness
was
slipped
on
them
in
spite
of
their
frantic
struggles
when
all
was
ready
patricio
got
on
the
box
seized
the
whip
and
told
us
to
cut
away
the
wild
animals
scrambled
to
their
feet
bucking
and
squealing
above
the
uproar
came
the
crack
of
the
heavy
whip
and
patricio
s
bellow
ujos
de
la
gran
and
they
jerked
forward
running
the
big
coach
taking
the
arroyos
like
an
express
train
soon
it
vanished
behind
its
own
pall
of
dust
and
appeared
hours
afterward
crawling
up
the
side
of
a
great
hill
miles
away
panchito
was
eleven
years
old
already
a
trooper
with
a
rifle
too
heavy
for
him
and
a
horse
that
they
had
to
lift
him
on
his
was
victoriano
a
veteran
of
fourteen
seven
others
of
the
tropa
were
under
seventeen
and
there
was
a
sullen
woman
riding
who
wore
two
she
rode
with
the
with
them
in
the
cuartels
why
are
you
fighting
i
asked
her
she
jerked
her
head
toward
the
fierce
figure
of
julian
reyes
because
he
is
she
answered
he
who
stands
under
a
good
tree
is
sheltered
by
a
good
shade
a
good
rooster
will
crow
in
any
capped
isidro
a
parrot
is
green
all
over
chimed
in
someone
else
faces
we
see
but
hearts
we
do
not
comprehend
said
josé
sentimentally
at
noon
we
roped
a
steer
and
cut
his
throat
and
because
there
was
no
time
to
build
a
fire
we
ripped
the
meat
from
the
carcase
and
ate
it
raw
meester
shouted
josé
do
the
united
states
soldiers
eat
raw
meat
i
said
i
didn
t
think
they
did
it
is
good
for
the
in
the
campaign
we
have
no
time
for
anything
but
it
makes
us
brave
by
late
afternoon
we
had
caught
up
with
the
coach
and
galloped
with
it
down
through
the
dry
arroyo
and
up
through
the
other
side
past
the
great
court
that
flanks
the
hacienda
of
la
zarca
unlike
la
mimbrera
the
casa
grande
here
stands
on
a
level
place
with
the
peons
houses
in
long
rows
at
its
flanks
and
a
flat
desert
barren
of
chaparral
for
twenty
miles
in
front
che
che
campa
also
paid
a
visit
to
la
zarca
the
big
house
is
a
black
and
gaping
ruin
nights
at
of
course
i
took
up
quarters
at
the
cuartel
and
right
here
i
want
to
mention
one
fact
americans
had
insisted
that
the
mexican
was
fundamentally
i
might
expect
to
have
my
outfit
stolen
the
first
day
out
now
for
two
weeks
i
lived
with
as
rough
a
band
of
as
there
was
in
the
army
they
were
without
discipline
and
without
education
they
were
many
of
them
they
had
not
been
paid
a
cent
for
six
weeks
and
some
were
so
desperately
poor
that
they
couldn
t
boast
sandals
or
serapes
i
was
a
stranger
with
a
good
outfit
unarmed
i
had
a
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
which
i
put
conspicuously
at
the
head
of
my
bed
when
i
slept
and
i
never
lost
a
thing
but
more
than
that
i
was
not
permitted
to
pay
for
my
food
and
in
a
company
where
money
was
scarce
and
tobacco
almost
unknown
i
was
kept
supplied
with
all
i
could
smoke
by
the
every
suggestion
from
me
that
i
should
pay
for
it
was
an
insult
the
only
thing
possible
was
to
hire
music
for
a
long
after
juan
sanchez
and
i
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
that
night
we
could
hear
the
rhythm
of
the
music
and
the
shouts
of
the
dancers
it
must
have
been
midnight
when
somebody
threw
open
the
door
and
yelled
meester
meester
are
you
asleep
come
to
the
too
sleepy
i
said
after
some
further
argument
the
messenger
departed
but
in
ten
minutes
back
he
came
el
capitan
fernando
orders
you
to
come
at
once
now
the
others
woke
up
come
to
the
meester
they
shouted
juan
sanchez
sat
up
and
began
pulling
on
his
shoes
now
we
re
off
said
he
the
meester
is
going
to
dance
captain
s
orders
come
on
meester
i
ll
go
if
all
the
tropa
does
i
said
they
raised
a
yell
at
that
and
the
night
was
full
of
chuckling
men
pulling
on
their
clothes
twenty
of
us
reached
the
house
in
a
body
the
mob
of
peons
blocking

opened
to
let

introduce
you
to
the
best
girl
in
the
zarca
there
was
nothing
to
do
the
window
was
jammed
with
faces
and
a
hundred
tried
to
crowd
in
at
the
door
it
was
an
ordinary
room
in
a
peon
s
house
whitewashed
with
a
humpy
dirt
floor
in
the
light
of
two
candles
sat
the
musicians
the
music
struck
up
á
a
grinning
silence
fell
i
gathered
the
young
lady
under
my
arm
and
started
the
preliminary
march
around
the
room
customary
before
the
dance
begins
we
waltzed
painfully
for
a
moment
or
two
and
suddenly
they
all
began
to
yell
what
do
you
do
now
loose
her
a
perfect
yell
but
i
don
t
know
how
the
fool

know
how
to

cried
one
another
began
the
mocking
song
the
gringos
all

fools
ve
never
been
in
sonora
when
they
want
to
say
diez
reales
call
it
dollar
an
a
quarta
but
patricio
bounded
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
sabas
after
him
each
seized
a
from
the
line
of
women
sitting
along
one
end
of
the
room
and
as
i
led
my
partner
back
to
her
seat
they
first
a
few
waltz
steps
the
man
whirled
away
from
the
girl
snapping
his
fingers
throwing
one
arm
up
to
cover
his
face
while
the
girl
put
one
hand
on
her
hip
and
danced
after
him
they
approached
each
other
receded
danced
around
each
other
the
girls
were
dumpy
and
dull
and
awkward
bowed
at
the
shoulder
from
much
grinding
of
corn
and
washing
of
clothes
some
of
the
men
had
on
heavy
boots
some
none
many
wore
pistols
and
and
a
few
carried
rifles
slung
from
their
shoulders
the
dance
was
always
preceded
by
a
grand
then
after
the
couple
had
danced
twice
the
circuit
of
the
room
they
walked
again
there
were
waltz
and
mazurka
beside
the
each
girl
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
never
spoke
and
stumbled
heavily
after
you
add
to
this
a
dirt
floor
full
of
arroyos
and
you
have
a
form
of
torture
unequaled
anywhere
in
the
world
it
seemed
to
me
i
danced
for
hours
spurred
on
by
the
chorus
dance
meester
keep
it
up
don
t
quit
later
there
was
another
jota
and
here
s
where
i
almost
got
into
trouble
i
danced
this
one
another
girl
and
afterward
when
i
asked
my
original
partner
to
she
was
furiously
angry
you
shamed
me
before
them
all
said
she
said
you
didn
t
know
how
to
dance
the
as
we
marched
around
the
room
she
appealed
to
her
friends
domingo
juan
come
out
and
take
me
away
from
this
gringo
he
won
t
dare
to
do
anything
half
a
dozen
of
them
started
onto
the
floor
and
the
rest
looked
on
it
was
a
ticklish
moment
but
all
at
once
the
good
fernando
glided
in
front
a
revolver
in
his
hand
the
americano
is
my
friend
said
he
get
back
there
and
mind
your
business
the
horses
were
tired
so
we
rested
a
day
in
la
zarca
behind
the
casa
grande
lay
a
ruined
garden
full
of
gray
alamo
trees
figs
vines
and
great
it
was
walled
around
by
high
adobe
walls
on
three
sides
over
one
of
which
the
ancient
white
tower
of
the
church
floated
in
the
blue
sky
the
fourth
side
opened
upon
a
reservoir
of
yellow
water
and
beyond
it
stretched
the
western
desert
miles
upon
miles
of
tawny
desolation
trooper
marin
and
i
lay
under
a
fig
tree
watching
the
vultures
sail
over
us
on
quiet
wing
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
by
loud
swift
music
pablo
had
found
a
pianola
in
the
church
where
it
had
escaped
che
che
campa
s
notice
the
previous
year
with
it
was
one
roll
the
merry
widow
waltz
nothing
would
do
but
that
we
carry
the
instrument
out
into
the
ruined
patio
we
took
turns
playing
the
thing
all
day
long
rafaelito
volunteering
the
information
that
the
merry
widow
was
mexico
s
most
popular
piece
a
mexican
he
said
had
composed
it
the
finding
of
the
pianola
suggested
that
we
give
another
that
night
in
the
portico
of
the
casa
grande
itself
candles
were
stuck
upon
the
pillars
the
faint
light
flickering
upon
broken
walls
burned
and
blackened
doorways
the
riot
of
wild
vines
that
had
twisted
unchecked
around
the
the
entire
patio
was
crowded
with
blanketed
men
making
holiday
even
yet
a
little
uncomfortable
in
the
great
house
which
they
had
never
been
allowed
to
enter
as
soon
as
the
orchestra
had
finished
a
dance
the
pianola
immediately
took
up
the
task
dance
followed
dance
without
any
rest
a
barrel
of
further
complicated
things
as
the
evening
wore
on
the
assembly
got
more
and
more
exhilarated
sabas
who
was
pablo
s
orderly
led
off
with
pablo
s
mistress
i
followed
immediately
afterward
pablo
hit
her
on
the
head
with
the
butt
end
of
his
revolver
and
said
he
d
shoot
her
if
she
danced
with
anyone
else
and
her
partner
too
after
sitting
some
moments
meditating
sabas
rose
pulled
his
revolver
and
informed
the
harpist
that
he
had
played
a
wrong
note
then
he
shot
at
him
other
disarmed
sabas
who
immediately
went
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
the
interest
in
meester
s
dancing
soon
shifted
to
other
phenomena
i
sat
down
beside
julian
reyes
he
with
the
christ
and
virgin
on
the
front
of
his
sombrero
he
was
far
gone
in
eyes
burned
like
a
fanatic
s
he
turned
on
me
suddenly
are
you
going
to
fight
with
us
no
i
said
i
am
a
correspondent
i
am
forbidden
to
fight
it
is
a
lie
he
cried
you
don
t
fight
because
you
are
afraid
to
fight
in
the
face
of
god
our
cause
is
just
yes
i
know
that
but
my
orders
are
not
to
fight
what
do
i
care
for
orders
he
shrieked
we
want
no
correspondents
we
want
no
words
printed
in
a
book
we
want
rifles
and
killing
and
if
we
die
we
shall
be
caught
up
among
the
saints
coward
huertista
that
s
enough
cried
someone
and
i
looked
up
to
see
longinos
güereca
standing
over
me
julian
reyes
you
know
nothing
this
comes
thousands
of
miles
by
the
sea
and
the
land
to
tell
his
countrymen
the
truth
of
the
fight
for
liberty
he
goes
into
battle
without
arms
he
s
braver
than
you
are
because
you
have
a
rifle
get
out
now
and
don
t
bother
him
any
more
he
sat
down
where
julian
had
been
smiled
his
homely
gentle
smile
and
took
both
my
hands
in
his
we
shall
be
eh
said
longinos
güereca
we
shall
sleep
in
the
same
blankets
and
always
be
together
and
when
we
get
to
the
cadena
i
shall
take
you
to
my
home
and
my
father
shall
make
you
my
brother
i
will
show

lost
of
the
spaniards

richest
mines
in
the
world

ll
work
them
together
eh
we
ll
be
rich
eh
and
from
that
time
on
until
the
end
longinos
güereca
and
i
were
always
together
but
the
grew
wilder
and
wilder
orchestra
and
pianola
alternated
without
a
break
everybody
was
drunk
now
pablo
was
boasting
horribly
of
killing
defenseless
prisoners
occasionally
some
insult
would
be
passed
and
there
would
be
a
snapping
of
rifle
levers
all
over
the
place
then
perhaps
the
poor
exhausted
women
would
begin
to
go
home
and
what
an
ominous
shout
would
go
up
don
t
go
stop
come
back
here
and
dance
come
back
here
and
the
dejected
procession
would
halt
and
straggle
back
at
four
o
clock
when
somebody
started
the
report
that
a
gringo
huertista
spy
was
among
us
i
decided
to
go
to
bed
but
the
kept
up
until
seven
quien
vive
at
dawn
i
woke
to
the
sound
of
shooting
and
a
cracked
bugle
blowing
wildly
juan
sanchez
stood
in
front
of
the
cuartel
sounding
reveille
he
didn
t
know
which
call
reveille
was
so
he
played
them
all
patricio
had
roped
a
steer
for
breakfast
the
animal
started
on
a
plunging
bellowing
run
for
the
desert
patricio
s
horse
galloping
alongside
the
rest
of
the
tropa
only
their
eyes
showing
over
their
serapes
kneeled
with
their
rifles
to
their
shoulders
crash
in
that
still
air
the
enormous
sound
of
guns
labored
heavily
up
the
running
steer
jerked
sideways
screaming
reached
us
faintly
crash
he
fell
headlong
his
feet
kicked
in
the
air
patricio
s
pony
jerked
roughly
up
and
his
serape
flapped
like
a
banner
just
then
the
enormous
sun
rose
bodily
out
of
the
east
pouring
clear
light
over
the
barren
plain
like
a
sea
pablo
emerged
from
the
casa
grande
leaning
on
his
wife
s
shoulder
i
am
going
to
be
very
ill
he
groaned
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
juan
reed
will
ride
my
horse
he
got
into
the
coach
weakly
took
the
guitar
and
sang
i
remained
at
the
foot
of
a
green
ungrateful
love
went
away
with
awoke
to
the
song
of
the
lark
what
a
hangover
i
have
and
the
barkeeps
won
t
trust
me
o
god
take
away
this
sickness
feel
as
if
i
were
surely
going
to
virgin
of
pulque
and
whisky
must
save
me
what
a
hangover
and
nothing
to
drink
it
is
some
miles
from
la
zarca
to
the
hacienda
of
la
cadena
where
the
tropa
was
to
be
stationed
we
rode
it
in
one
day
without
water
and
without
food
the
coach
soon
left
us
far
behind
pretty
soon
the
barrenness
of
the
land
gave
way
to
spiny
hostile
vegetation
cactus
and
the
mesquite
we
strung
out
along
a
deep
rut
between
the
gigantic
chaparral
choked
with
the
mighty
cloud
of
alkali
dust
scratched
and
torn
by
the
thorny
brush
sometimes
emerging
in
an
open
space
we
could
see
the
straight
road
climbing
the
summits
of
the
rolling
desert
until
the
eye
couldn
t
follow
it
but
we
knew
it
must
be
there
still
farther
and
farther
again
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
vertical
sun
beat
down
with
a
fury
that
made
one
reel
and
most
of
the
troop
who
had
been
drunk
the
night
before
began
to
suffer
terribly
their
lips
glazed
cracked
turned
dark
blue
i
didn
t
hear
a
single
word
of
complaint
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
lighthearted
joking
and
rollicking
of
other
days
josé
valiente
taught
me
how
to
chew
mesquite
twigs
but
that
didn
t
help
much
when
we
had
been
riding
for
hours
fidencio
pointed
ahead
saying
huskily
here
comes
a
when
you
realize
that
word
which
now
means
simply
man
is
descended
among
the
indians
from
immeasurable
antiquity
when
the
man
that
says
it
looks
exactly
as
guatemozin
might
have
looked
it
gives
you
curious
sensations
the
in
question
was
a
very
aged
indian
driving
a
burro
no
he
said
he
didn
t
carry
any
water
but
sabas
leaped
from
his
horse
and
tumbled
the
old
man
s
pack
on
the
ground
ah
he
cried
fine
and
held
up
a
root
of
the
plant
which
looks
like
a
varnished
and
oozes
with
intoxicating
juices
we
divided
it
as
you
divide
an
artichoke
pretty
soon
everybody
felt
better
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
that
we
rounded
a
shoulder
of
the
desert
and
saw
ahead
the
gigantic
ashen
alamo
trees
that
surrounded
the
spring
of
the
hacienda
of
santo
domingo
a
pillar
of
brown
dust
like
the
smoke
of
a
burning
city
rose
from
the
corral
where
were
roping
horses
desolate
and
alone
stood
the
casa
grande
burned
by
che
che
campa
a
year
ago
and
by
the
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
alamo
trees
a
dozen
wandering
peddlers
squatted
around
their
fire
their
burros
munching
corn
from
the
fountain
to
the
adobe
houses
and
back
moved
an
endless
chain
of
women
symbol
of
northern
mexico
water
we
shouted
joyously
galloping
down
the
hill
the
were
already
at
the
spring
with
patricio
leaping
from
their
saddles
the
tropa
threw
themselves
on
their
bellies
men
and
horses
indiscriminately
thrust
in
their
heads
and
drank
and
drank
it
was
the
most
glorious
sensation
i
have
ever
felt
who
has
a
cigarro
cried
somebody
for
a
few
blessed
minutes
we
lay
on
our
backs
smoking
the
sound
of
me
sit
up
and
there
across
my
vision
moved
the
strangest
procession
in
the
world
first
came
a
ragged
peon
carrying
the
flowering
branch
of
some
tree
behind
him
another
bore
upon
his
head
a
little
box
that
looked
like
a
coffin
painted
in
broad
strips
of
blue
pink
and
silver
there
followed
four
men
carrying
a
sort
of
canopy
made
of
bunting
a
woman
walked
beneath
it
though
the
canopy
hid
her
down
to
the
waist
but
on
top
lay
the
body
of
a
little
girl
with
bare
feet
and
little
brown
hands
crossed
on
her
breast
there
was
a
wreath
of
paper
flowers
in
her
hair
and
her
whole
body
was
heaped
with
them
a
harpist
brought
up
the
rear
playing
a
popular
waltz
called
de
the
funeral
procession
moved
slowly
and
gaily
along
passing
the
court
where
the
players
never
ceased
their
handball
game
to
the
little
campo
santo
bah
spat
julian
reyes
furiously
that
is
a
blasphemy
to
the
dead
in
the
late
sunshine
the
desert
was
a
glowing
thing
we
rode
in
a
silent
enchanted
land
that
seemed
some
kingdom
under
the
sea
all
around
were
great
cactuses
colored
red
blue
purple
yellow
as
coral
is
on
the
ocean
bed
behind
us
to
the
west
the
coach
rolled
along
in
a
glory
of
dust
like
elijah
s
chariot
eastward
under
a
sky
already
darkening
to
stars
were
the
rumpled
mountains
behind
which
lay
la
cadena
the
advance
post
of
the
maderista
army
it
was
a
land
to
land
to
fight
for
the
suddenly
began
the
interminable
song
of
the
in
which
the
federal
chiefs
are
the
bulls
and
the
maderista
generals
the
and
as
i
looked
at
the
gay
lovable
humble
who
had
given
so
much
of
their
lives
and
of
their
comfort
to
the
brave
fight
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
of
the
little
speech
villa
made
to
the
foreigners
who
left
chihuahua
in
the
first
refugee
train
this
is
the
latest
news
for
you
to
take
to
your
people
there
shall
be
no
more
palaces
in
mexico
the
of
the
poor
are
better
than
the
bread
of
the
rich
come
it
was
late
the
coach
broke
down
on
a
stretch
of
rocky
road
between
high
mountains
i
stopped
to
get
my
blankets
and
when
i
started
on
again
the
had
long
vanished
down
the
winding
road
somewhere
near
i
knew
was
la
cadena
at
any
minute
now
a
sentinel
might
start
up
out
of
the
chaparral
for
about
a
mile
i
descended
a
steep
road
that
was
often
the
dried
bed
of
a
river
winding
down
between
high
mountains
it
was
a
black
night
without
stars
and
bitter
cold
finally
the
mountains
opened
into
a
vast
plain
and
across
that
i
could
faintly
see
the
tremendous
range
of
the
cadena
and
the
pass
that
the
tropa
was
to
guard
barely
three
leagues
beyond
that
pass
lay
mapimi
held
by
twelve
hundred
federals
but
the
hacienda
was
still
hidden
by
a
roll
of
the
desert
i
was
quite
upon
it
without
being
challenged
before
i
saw
it
an
indistinct
white
square
of
buildings
on
the
other
side
of
a
deep
arroyo
and
still
no
sentinel
that
s
funny
i
said
to
myself
they
don
t
keep
very
good
watch
here
i
plunged
down
into
the
arroyo
and
climbed
up
the
other
side
in
one
of
the
great
rooms
of
the
casa
grande
were
lights
and
music
peering
through
i
saw
the
indefatigable
sabas
whirling
in
the
mazes
of
the
and
isidro
amayo
and
josé
valiente
a
just
then
a
man
with
a
gun
lounged
out
of
the
lighted
doorway
quien
vive
he
shouted
lazily
madero
i
shouted
may
he
live
returned
the
sentinel
and
went
back
to
the
outpost
of
the
there
were
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
us
stationed
at
la
cadena
the
advance
guard
of
all
the
maderista
army
to
the
west
our
business
was
to
guard
a
pass
the
puerta
de
la
cadena
but
the
troops
were
quartered
at
the
hacienda
ten
miles
away
it
stood
upon
a
little
plateau
a
deep
arroyo
on
one
side
at
the
bottom
of
which
a
sunken
river
came
to
the
surface
for
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
and
vanished
again
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
up
and
down
the
broad
valley
was
the
fiercest
kind
of
desert
and
a
thicket
of
chaparral
cactus
and
sword
plant
directly
east
lay
the
puerta
breaking
the
tremendous
mountain
range
that
blotted
out
half
the
sky
and
extended
north
and
south
beyond
vision
wrinkled
like
a
giant
s
the
desert
tilted
up
to
meet
the
gap
and
beyond
was
nothing
but
the
fierce
blue
of
stainless
mexican
sky
from
the
puerta
you
could
see
fifty
miles
across
the
vast
arid
plain
that
the
spaniards
named
de
los
where
the
little
mountains
lie
tumbled
about
and
four
leagues
away
the
low
gray
houses
of
mapimi
there
lay
the
enemy
twelve
hundred
or
federal
irregulars
under
the
infamous
colonel
argumendo
the
are
the
bandits
that
made
orozco
s
revolution
they
were
so
called
because
their
flag
was
red
and
because
their
hands
were
red
with
slaughter
too
they
swept
through
northern
mexico
burning
pillaging
and
robbing
the
poor
in
chihuahua
they
cut
the
soles
from
the
feet
of
one
poor
devil
and
drove
him
a
mile
across
the
desert
before
he
died
and
i
have
seen
a
city
of
four
thousand
souls
reduced
to
after
a
visit
by
the
when
villa
took
torreon
there
was
no
mercy
for
the
they
are
always
shot
the
first
day
we
reached
la
cadena
twelve
of
them
rode
up
to
reconnoiter
of
the
tropa
were
on
guard
at
the
fuerta
they
captured
one
they
made
him
get
off
his
horse
and
took
away
his
rifle
clothes
and
shoes
then
they
made
him
run
naked
through
a
hundred
yards
of
chaparral
and
cactus
shooting
at
him
juan
sanchez
finally
dropped
him
screaming
and
thereby
won
the
rifle
which
he
brought
back
as
a
present
to
me
the
they
left
to
the
great
mexican
buzzards
which
flap
lazily
above
the
desert
all
day
long
when
all
this
happened
my
captain
longinos
güereca
and
trooper
juan
vallejo
and
i
had
borrowed
the
colonel
s
coach
for
a
trip
to
the
dusty
little
rancho
of
bruquilla
home
it
lay
four
desert
leagues
to
the
north
where
a
spring
burst
miraculously
out
of
a
little
white
hill
old
güereca
was
a
peon
in
sandals
he
had
been
born
a
slave
on
one
of
the
great
haciendas
but
years
of
toil
too
appalling
to
realize
had
made
him
that
rare
being
in
mexico
the
independent
owner
of
a
small
property
he
had
ten
children
girls
and
sons
that
looked
like
new
england
farmhands
a
daughter
in
the
grave
the
güerecas
were
proud
ambitious
folk
longinos
said
this
is
my
dearly
loved
friend
juan
reed
and
my
brother
and
the
old
man
and
his
wife
put
both
their
arms
around
me
and
patted
me
on
the
back
in
the
affectionate
way
mexicans
embrace
my
family
owes
nothing
to
the
revolucion
said
gino
proudly
others
have
taken
money
and
horses
and
wagons
the
of
the
army
have
become
rich
from
the
property
of
the
great
haciendas
the
güerecas
have
given
all
to
the
maderistas
and
have
taken
nothing
but
my
rank
the
old
man
however
was
a
little
bitter
holding
up
a
horsehair
rope
he
said
three
years
ago
i
had
four
like
this
now
i
have
only
one
one
the
took
and
the
other
urbina
s
people
took
and
the
last
one
josé
bravo
what
difference
does
it
make
which
side
robs
you
but
he
didn
t
mean
it
all
he
was
immensely
proud
of
his
youngest
son
the
bravest
officer
in
all
the
army
we
sat
in
the
long
adobe
room
eating
the
most
exquisite
cheese
and
with
fresh
deaf
old
mother
apologizing
in
a
loud
voice
for
the
poverty
of
the
food
and
her
warlike
son
reciting
his
personal
iliad
of
the
fight
around
torreon
we
got
so
close
he
was
saying
that
the
hot
air
and
burning
powder
stung
us
in
the
face
we
got
too
close
to
shoot
so
we
clubbed
our
just
then
all
the
dogs
began
to
bark
at
once
we
leaped
from
our
seats
one
didn
t
know
what
to
expect
in
the
cadena
those
days
it
was
a
small
boy
on
horseback
shouting
that
the
were
entering
the
off
he
galloped
longinos
roared
to
put
the
mules
in
the
coach
the
entire
family
fell
to
work
with
a
fury
and
in
five
minutes
longinos
dropped
on
one
knee
and
kissed
his
father
s
hand
and
we
were
tearing
down
the
road
don
t
be
killed
don
t
be
killed
don
t
be
killed
we
could
hear
the
señora
wailing
we
passed
a
wagon
loaded
with
with
a
whole
family
of
women
and
children
two
tin
trunks
and
an
iron
bed
perched
on
top
the
man
of
the
family
rode
a
burro
yes
the
were
of
them
pouring
through
the
puerta
the
last
time
the
had
come
they
had
killed
his
daughter
for
three
years
there
had
been
war
in
this
valley
and
he
had
not
complained
because
it
was
for
the
patria
now
they
would
go
to
the
united
states
but
juan
lashed
the
mules
cruelly
and
we
heard
no
more
farther
along
was
an
old
man
without
shoes
placidly
driving
some
goats
had
he
heard
about
the
well
there
had
been
some
gossip
about
were
they
coming
through
the
puerta
and
how
many
quien
sabe
señor
at
last
yelling
at
the
staggering
mules
we
came
into
camp
just
in
time
to
see
the
victorious
tropa
straggle
in
across
the
desert
firing
off
many
more
rounds
of
ammunition
than
they
had
used
in
the
fight
they
moved
low
along
the
ground
scarcely
higher
on
their
broncos
than
the
drab
mesquite
through
which
they
flashed
all
big
sombreros
and
flapping
gay
serapes
the
last
sunshine
on
their
lifted
rifles
that
very
night
came
a
courier
from
general
urbina
saying
that
he
was
ill
and
wanted
pablo
seañes
to
come
back
so
off
went
the
great
coach
and
pablo
s
mistress
and
raphaelito
the
hunchback
and
fidencio
and
patricio
pablo
said
to
me
juanito
if
you
want
to
come
back
with
us
you
shall
sit
beside
me
in
the
coach
patricio
and
raphaelito
begged
me
to
come
but
i
had
got
so
far
to
the
front
now
that
i
didn
t
want
to
turn
back
then
the
next
day
my
friends
and
of
the
tropa
whom
i
had
learned
to
know
so
well
in
our
march
across
the
desert
received
orders
to
move
to
jarralitos
only
juan
vallejo
and
longinos
güereca
stayed
behind
the
cadena
s
new
garrison
were
a
different
kind
of
men
god
knows
where
they
came
from
but
it
was
a
place
where
the
troopers
had
literally
starved
they
were
the
most
wretchedly
poor
peons
that
i
have
ever
half
of
them
didn
t
have
serapes
some
fifty
were
known
to
be
who
had
never
smelt
powder
about
the
same
number
were
under
a
dreadfully
incompetent
old
party
named
major
salazar
and
the
remaining
fifty
were
equipped
with
old
carbines
and
ten
rounds
of
ammunition
apiece
our
commanding
officer
was
petronilo
hernandez
who
had
been
six
years
a
major
in
the
federal
army
until
the
murder
of
madero
drove
him
to
the
other
side
he
was
a
brave
little
man
with
twisted
shoulders
but
years
of
official
army
red
tape
had
unfitted
him
to
handle
troops
like
these
every
morning
he
issued
an
order
of
the
day
distributing
guards
posting
sentinels
and
naming
the
officer
on
duty
nobody
ever
read
it
officers
in
that
army
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
disciplining
or
ordering
of
soldiers
they
are
officers
because
they
have
been
brave
and
their
job
is
to
fight
at
the
head
of
their
s
all
the
soldiers
all
look
up
to
some
one
general
under
whom
they
are
recruited
as
to
their
feudal
lord
they
call
themselves
his
people
and
an
officer
of
anybody
else
s
hasn
t
much
authority
over
them
petronilo
was
of
urbina
s
but
of
the
cadena
garrison
belonged
to
arrieta
s
division
that
s
why
there
were
no
sentinels
to
the
west
and
north
alberto
redondo
guarded
another
pass
four
leagues
to
the
south
so
we
thought
we
were
safe
in
that
direction
true
men
did
outpost
duty
at
the
fuerta
and
the
puerta
was
strong
five
the
casa
grande
of
la
cadena
had
been
sacked
of
course
by
che
che
campa
the
year
before
in
the
patio
were
corraled
the
officers
horses
we
slept
on
the
tiled
floors
of
the
rooms
surrounding
it
in
the
of
the
owner
once
barbarically
decorated
pegs
were
driven
into
the
walls
to
hang
saddles
and
bridles
on
rifles
and
sabers
were
stacked
against
the
wall
and
dirty
lay
flung
into
the
corner
at
night
a
fire
of
was
built
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
we
squatted
around
it
while
apolinario
and
gil
tomas
who
was
once
a
told
stories
of
the
bloody
three
years
at
the
taking
of
durango
said
apolinario
i
was
of
the
of
captain
borunda
he
that
they
call
the
because
he
always
shoots
his
prisoners
but
when
urbina
took
durango
there
weren
t
many
prisoners
so
borunda
thirsty
for
blood
made
the
rounds
of
all
the
saloons
and
in
every
one
he
would
pick
out
some
unarmed
man
and
ask
him
if
he
were
a
federal
no
señor
the
man
would
say
you
deserve
death
because
you
have
not
told
the
truth
yelled
borunda
pulling
his
gun
bang
we
all
laughed
heartily
at
this
that
reminds
me
broke
in
gil
of
the
time
i
fought
with
rojas
in
orozco
cursed
be
his
mother
an
old
porfirista
officer
deserted
to
our
side
and
orozco
sent
him
out
to
teach
the
animals
how
to
drill
there
was
one
droll
fellow
in
our
company
oh
he
had
a
fine
sense
of
humor
he
pretended
he
was
too
stupid
to
learn
the
manual
of
arms
so
this
cursed
old
may
he
fry
in
hell
him
drill
alone
shoulder
arms
the
did
it
all
right
present
arms
perfectly
port
arms
he
acted
like
he
didn
t
know
how
so
the
old
fool
went
around
and
took
hold
of
the
rifle
this
way
says
he
pulling
on
it
oh
says
the
fellow
way
and
he
let
him
have
the
bayonet
right
in
the
chest
after
that
fernando
silveyra
the
paymaster
recounted
a
few
anecdotes
of
the
or
priests
that
sounded
exactly
like
touraine
in
the
thirteenth
century
or
the
feudal
rights
of
landlords
over
their
women
tenants
before
the
french
revolution
fernando
ought
to
have
known
too
for
he
was
brought
up
for
the
church
there
must
have
been
about
twenty
of
us
sitting
around
that
fire
all
the
way
from
the
most
miserably
poor
peon
in
the
tropa
up
to
first
captain
longinos
güereca
there
wasn
t
one
of
these
men
who
had
any
religion
at
all
although
once
they
had
all
been
strict
catholics
but
three
years
of
war
have
taught
the
mexican
people
many
things
there
will
never
be
another
porfirio
diaz
there
will
never
be
another
orozco
revolution
and
the
catholic
church
in
mexico
will
never
again
be
the
voice
of
god
then
juan
santillanes
a
who
seriously
informed
me
that
he
was
descended
from
the
great
spanish
hero
gil
blas
piped
up
the
ancient
disreputable
ditty
which
begins
i
am
count
the
spanish
artillery
juan
proudly
displayed
four
bullet
wounds
he
had
killed
a
few
defenseless
prisoners
with
his
own
gun
he
said
giving
promise
of
growing
up
to
be
a
great
killer
some
day
he
boasted
of
being
the
strongest
and
bravest
man
in
the
army
his
idea
of
humor
seemed
to
be
breaking
eggs
into
the
pocket
of
my
coat
juan
was
very
young
for
his
years
but
very
likable
but
the
best
friend
i
had
beside
gino
güereca
was
subteniente
luis
martinez
they
called
him
contemptuous
name
for
he
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
portrait
of
some
noble
spanish
youth
by
greco
luis
was
pure
gay
and
he
was
only
twenty
and
had
never
been
in
battle
around
the
contour
of
his
face
was
a
faint
black
beard
he
fingered
it
grinning
nicanor
and
i
made
a
bet
that
we
wouldn
t
shave
until
we
took
torreon
luis
and
i
slept
in
different
rooms
but
at
night
when
the
fire
had
gone
out
and
the
rest
of
the
fellows
were
snoring
we
sat
at
each
other
s
night
in
his
cuartel
the
one
next
to
about
the
world
our
girls
and
what
we
were
going
to
be
and
to
do
when
we
really
got
at
it
when
the
war
was
over
luis
was
coming
to
the
united
states
to
visit
me
and
then
we
were
both
coming
back
to
durango
city
to
visit
the
martinez
family
he
showed
me
the
photograph
of
a
little
baby
proudly
boasting
that
he
was
an
uncle
already
what
will
you
do
when
the
bullets
begin
to
fly
i
asked
him
sabe
he
laughed
i
guess
i
ll
run
it
was
late
the
sentinel
at
the
door
had
long
since
gone
to
sleep
don
t
go
said
luis
grabbing
my
coat
let
s
gossip
a
little
longer
gino
juan
santillanes
silveyra
luis
juan
vallejo
and
i
rode
up
the
arroyo
to
bathe
in
a
pool
that
was
rumored
to
be
there
it
was
a
scorched
river
bed
filled
with
sand
rimmed
with
dense
mesquite
and
cactus
every
kilometer
the
hidden
river
showed
itself
for
a
little
space
only
to
disappear
at
a
crackling
white
rim
of
alkali
first
came
the
horse
pool
the
troopers
and
their
wretched
ponies
gathered
around
it
one
or
two
squatting
on
the
rim
scooping
water
up
against
the
animals
sides
with
calabashes
above
them
kneeled
the
women
at
their
eternal
laundry
on
the
stones
beyond
that
the
ancient
path
from
the
hacienda
cut
across
where
the
line
of
women
moved
with
on
their
heads
still
farther
up
were
women
bathers
wrapped
round
and
round
with
yards
of
pale
blue
or
white
cotton
and
naked
brown
babies
splashing
in
the
shallows
and
last
of
all
naked
brown
men
with
sombreros
on
and
serapes
draped
over
their
shoulders
smoked
their
squatting
on
the
rocks
we
flushed
a
coyote
up
there
and
scrambled
steeply
up
to
the
desert
pulling
at
our
revolvers
there
he
went
we
spurred
into
the
chaparral
on
the
dead
run
shooting
and
yelling
but
of
course
he
got
away
and
later
much
later
we
found
the
mythical
cool
deep
basin
worn
in
the
solid
rock
with
green
weeds
growing
on
the
bottom
when
we
got
back
gino
güereca
became
greatly
excited
because
his
new
horse
had
come
from
stallion
that
his
father
had
raised
for
him
to
ride
at
the
head
of
his
company
if
he
is
dangerous
announced
juan
santillanes
as
we
hurried
out
i
want
to
ride
him
first
i
love
to
subdue
dangerous
horses
a
mighty
cloud
of
yellow
dust
filled
all
the
corral
rising
high
into
the
still
air
through
it
appeared
the
dim
chaotic
shapes
of
many
running
horses
their
hoofs
made
dull
thunder
men
were
vaguely
visible
all
braced

grinned
gino
after

with
dignity

but
juan
vallejo
already
was
astride
shouting
to
them
to
loose
the
ropes
with
a
sort
of
squealing
roar
the
struggled
up
and
the
earth
trembled
to
his
furious
fight
we
dined
in
the
ancient
kitchen
of
the
hacienda
sitting
on
stools
around
a
packing
box
the
ceiling
was
a
rich
greasy
brown
from
the
smoke
of
generations
of
meals
one
entire
end
of
the
room
was
taken
up
by
immense
adobe
stoves
ovens
and
fireplaces
with
four
or
five
ancient
crones
bending
over
them
stirring
pots
and
turning
the
fire
was
our
only
light
flickering
strangely
over
the
old
women
lighting
up
the
black
wall
up
which
the
smoke
fled
to
wreathe
around
the
ceiling
and
finally
pour
from
the
window
there
were
colonel
petronilo
his
mistress
a
strangely
beautiful
peasant
woman
with
a
face
who
always
seemed
to
be
laughing
to
herself
about
something

telling
me
about
the
girl

a
finger
at

i

things

have
much
in
the
head
he
was
standing
up
now
the

badly
from

yards
of

a
clamor
of
voices
burst
out
all
together
from
the
others
but
it
was
interrupted
by
another
shot
and
then
another
and
men
shouting
came
a
trooper
running
mutiny
in
the
ranks
he
cried
they
won
t
obey
orders
who

t
snapped
don

the

so
we
wouldn

kill
em
ordered
out
tonight
to
guard
the
puerta
till
said
salazar
at
this
point
i
m
going
to
bed
the
peons
houses
at
la
cadena
where
the
troops
were
quartered
enclosed
a
great
square
like
a
walled
town
there
were
two
gates
at
one
we
forced
our
way
through
a
mob
of
women
and
peons
fighting
to
get
out
inside
there
were
dim
lights
from
doorways
and
three
or
four
little
fires
in
the
open
air
a
bunch
of
frightened
horses
crowded
one
another
in
a
corner
men
ran
wildly
in
and
out
of
their
cuartels
with
rifles
in
their
hands
in
the
center
of
the
open
space
stood
a
group
of
about
fifty
men
mostly
armed
as
if
to
repel
an
attack
guard
those
gates
cried
the
colonel
don
t
let
anybody
out
without
an
order
from
me
the
running
troops
began
to
mass
at
the
gates
don
petronilo
walked
out
alone
into
the
middle
of
the
square
what
s
the
trouble
he
asked
quietly
they
were
going
to
kill
us
all
yelled
somebody
from
the
darkness
they
wanted
to
escape
they
were
going
to
betray
us
to
the
it
s
a
lie
cried
those
in
the
center
we
are
not
don
petronilo
s
our
is
manuel
arrieta
suddenly
longinos
güereca
unarmed
flashed
by
us
and
fell
upon
them
furiously
wrenching
away
their
rifles
and
throwing
them
far
behind
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
if
the
rebels
would
turn
on
him
but
they
did
not
resist
disarm
them
ordered
don
petronilo
and
lock
them
up
they
herded
the
prisoners
into
one
large
room
with
an
armed
guard
at
the
door
and
long
after
midnight
i
could
hear
them
hilariously
singing
that
left
don
petronilo
with
a
hundred
effectives
some
extra
horses
with
running
sores
on
their
backs
and
two
thousand
rounds
of
ammunition
more
or
less
salazar
took
himself
off
in
the
morning
after
recommending
that
all
his
be
shot
he
was
evidently
greatly
relieved
to
be
rid
of
them
juan
santillanes
was
in
favor
of
execution
too
but
don
petronilo
decided
to
send
them
to
general
urbina
for
trial
last
the
days
at
la
cadena
were
full
of
color
in
the
cold
dawn
when
the
river
pools
were
filmed
with
ice
a
trooper
would
gallop
into
the
great
square
with
a
plunging
steer
at
the
end
of
his
rope
fifty
or
sixty
ragged
soldiers
only
their
eyes
showing
between
serapes
and
big
sombreros
would
begin
an
amateur
to
the
roaring
delight
of
the
rest
of
the
they
waved
their
blankets
shouting
the
correct
cries
one
would
twist
the
infuriated
animal
s
tail
another
more
impatient
beat
him
with
the
flat
of
a
sword
instead
of
banderillas
they
stuck
daggers
into
his
hot
blood
spattering
them
as
he
charged
and
when
at
last
he
was
down
and
the
merciful
knife
in
his
brain
a
mob
fell
upon
the
carcase
cutting
and
ripping
and
bearing
off
chunks
of
raw
meat
to
their
cuartels
then
the
white
burning
sun
would
rise
suddenly
behind
the
puerta
stinging
your
hands
and
face
and
the
pools
of
blood
the
faded
patterns
of
the
serapes
the
far
reaches
of
umber
desert
glowed
and
became
vivid
don
petronilo
had
confiscated
several
coaches
in
the
campaign
we
borrowed
them
for
many
an
five
of
us
once
it
was
a
trip
to
san
pedro
del
gallo
to
see
a
appropriately
enough
another
time
gino
güereca
and
i
went
to
see
the
fabulously
rich
lost
mines
of
the
spaniards
which
he
knew
but
we
never
got
past
lounged
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
ate
cheese
all
day
late
in
the
afternoon
the
puerta
guard
trotted
out
to
their
post
the
late
sun
soft
on
their
rifles
and
and
long
after
dark
the
detachment
relieved
came
jingling
in
out
of
the
mysterious
dark
the
four
peddlers
whom
i
had
seen
in
santo
domingo
arrived
that
night
they
had
four
burro
loads
of
to
sell
the
soldiers
it
s
meester
they
cried
when
i
came
down
to
their
little
fire
meester
how
goes
it
aren
t
you
afraid
of
the
how
is
business
i
asked
accepting
the
handful
of
they
gave
me
they
laughed
uproariously
at
this
business
far
better
for
us
if
we
had
stayed
in
santo
domingo
tropa
couldn
t
buy
one
cigarro
if
they
clubbed
their
money
one
of
them
began
to
sing
that
extraordinary
ballad
the
morning
song
to
francisco
villa
he
sang
one
verse
and
then
the
next
man
sang
a
verse
and
so
on
around
each
man
composing
a
dramatic
account
of
the
deeds
of
the
great
captain
for
half
an
hour
i
lay
there
watching
them
as
they
squatted
between
their
knees
serapes
draped
loosely
from
their
shoulders
the
firelight
red
on
their
simple
dark
faces
while
one
man
sang
the
others
stared
upon
the
ground
wrapt
in
composition
here
is
francisco
his
chiefs
and
his
officers
come
to
saddle
the
the
federal
get

now
colorados

an

has
come
to
torreon
is
because
he
could
do
it
viva
villa
and
his
soldiers
herrera
and
his
gente
have
seen
wicked
people
a
brave
man
can
with
this
now
i
say
the
rose
of
castile
is
the
end
of
my
the
great
general
villa
after
a
while
i
slipped
away
and
i
doubt
if
they
even
saw
me
go
they
sang
around
their
fire
for
more
than
three
hours
but
in
our
cuartel
there
was
other
entertainment
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
from
the
fire
on
the
floor
through
it
i
dimly
made
out
some
thirty
or
forty
troopers
squatting
or
sprawled
at
full
silent
as
silveyra
read
aloud
a
proclamation
from
the
governor
of
durango
forever
condemning
the
lands
of
the
great
haciendas
to
be
divided
among
the
poor
he
read
considering
that
the
principal
cause
of
discontent
among
the
people
in
our
state
which
forced
them
to
spring
to
arms
in
the
year
was
the
absolute
lack
of
individual
property
and
that
the
rural
classes
have
no
means
of
subsistence
in
the
present
nor
any
hope
for
the
future
except
to
serve
as
peons
on
the
haciendas
of
the
great
land
owners
who
have
monopolized
the
soil
of
the
state
considering
that
the
principal
branch
of
our
national
riches
is
agriculture
and
that
there
can
be
no
true
progress
in
agriculture
without
that
the
majority
of
farmers
have
a
personal
interest
in
making
the
earth
produce
considering
finally
that
the
rural
towns
have
been
reduced
to
the
deepest
misery
because
the
common
lands
which
they
once
owned
have
gone
to
augment
the
property
of
the
nearest
hacienda
especially
under
the
dictatorship
of
diaz
with
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
state
lost
their
economic
political
and
social
independence
then
passed
from
the
rank
of
citizens
to
that
of
slaves
without
the
government
being
able
to
lift
the
moral
level
through
education
because
the
hacienda
where
they
lived
is
private
property
therefore
the
government
of
the
state
of
durango
declares
it
a
public
necessity
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
and
villages
be
the
owners
of
agricultural
lands
when
the
paymaster
had
painfully
waded
through
all
the
provisions
that
followed
telling
how
the
land
was
to
be
applied
for
there
was
a
silence
that
said
martinez
is
the
mexican
revolucion
it
s
just
what
villa
s
doing
in
chihuahua
i
said
it
s
great
all
you
fellows
can
have
a
farm
now
an
amused
chuckle
ran
around
the
circle
then
a
little
man
with
yellow
stained
whiskers
sat
up
and
spoke
not
us
he
said
not
the
soldiers
after
a
revolucion
is
done
it
wants
no
more
soldiers
it
is
the
who
will
get
the
who
did
not
fight
and
the
next
generation
he
paused
and
spread
his
torn
sleeves
to
the
fire
i
was
a
school
teacher
he
explained
so
i
know
that
revolucions
like
republics
are
ungrateful
i
have
fought
three
years
at
the
end
of
the
first
revolucion
that
great
man
father
madero
invited
his
soldiers
to
the
capital
he
gave
us
clothes
and
food
and
we
returned
to
our
homes
and
found
the
greedy
again
in
power
i
ended
the
war
with
pesos
said
a
man
you
were
lucky
continued
the
schoolmaster
no
it
is
not
the
troopers
the
starved
unfed
common
soldiers
who
profit
by
the
revolucion
officers
they
get
fat
on
the
blood
of
the
patria
but
what
on
earth
are
you
fighting
for
i
cried
i
have
two
little
sons
he
answered
and
will
get
their
land
and
they
will
have
other
little
sons
they
too
will
never
want
for
food
the
little
man
grinned
we
have
a
proverb
in
guadalajara
do
not
wear
a
shirt
of
eleven
yards
for
he
who
wants
to
be
a
redeemer
will
be
i
ve
got
no
little
son
said
gil
tomas
amid
shouts
of
laughter
i
m
fighting
so
i
can
get
a
rifle
from
some
dead
federal
and
a
good
horse
that
belonged
to
a
millionaire
just
for
fun
i
asked
a
trooper
with
a
photo
button
of
madero
pinned
to
his
coat
who
that
was
quien
sabe
señor
he
replied
my
captain
told
me
he
was
a
great
saint
i
fight
because
it
is
not
so
hard
as
to
work
how
often
are
you
fellows
paid
we
were
paid
three
pesos
just
nine
months
ago
tonight
said
the
schoolmaster
and
they
all
nodded
we
are
the
real
volunteers
the
of
villa
are
professionals
then
luis
martinez
got
a
guitar
and
sang
a
beautiful
little
love
song
which
he
said
a
prostitute
had
made
up
one
night
in
a
the
last
thing
i
remember
of
that
memorable
night
was
gino
güereca
lying
near
me
in
the
dark
talking
he
said
i
shall
take
you
to
the
lost
of
the
spaniards
they
are
hidden
in
a
cañon
in
the
western
mountains
only
the
indians
know
of
i
the
indians
go
there
sometimes
with
knives
and
dig
the
raw
gold
out
of
the
ground
we
ll
be
rich
coming
of
the
before
sunrise
next
morning
fernando
silveyra
fully
dressed
came
into
the
room
and
said
calmly
to
get
up
that
the
were
coming
juan
vallejo
laughed
how
many
fernando
about
a
thousand
he
answered
in
a
quiet
voice
rummaging
for
his
bandolier
the
patio
was
unusually
full
of
shouting
men
saddling
horses
i
saw
don
petronilo
half
dressed
at
his
door
his
mistress
buckling
on
his
sword
juan
santillanes
was
pulling
at
his
trousers
with
furious
haste
there
was
a
steady
rattle
of
clicks
as
cartridges
slipped
into
rifles
a
score
of
soldiers
ran
to
and
fro
aimlessly
asking
everyone
where
something
was
i
don
t
think
we
any
of
us
really
believed
it
the
little
square
of
quiet
sky
over
the
patio
gave
promise
of
another
hot
day
roosters
crowed
a
cow
that
was
being
milked
bellowed
i
felt
hungry
how
near
are
they
i
asked
near
but
the
guard
at
the
puerta
asleep
fernando
said
as
he
strapped
on
his
pablo
arriola
clanked
in
crippled
by
his
big
spurs
a
little
bunch
of
twelve
rode
up
our
men
thought
it
was
only
the
daily
reconnaissance
so
after
they
drove
them
back
the
puerta
guard
sat
down
to
breakfast
then
argumedo
himself
and
but
could
hold
that
pass
against
an
army
until
the
rest
got
there
they
re
already
past
the
puerta
said
pablo
shouldering
his
saddle
he
went
out
the
swore
juan
santillanes
spinning
the
chambers
of
his
revolver
wait
till
i
get
at
them
now
meester
s
going
to
see
some
of
those
shots
he
wanted
cried
gil
tomas
how
about
it
meester

scared
somehow
the
whole
business
didn
t
seem
real
i
said
to
myself
you
lucky
devil

re
actually
going
to
see
a
fight
that
will
round
out
the
story
i
loaded
my
camera
and
hurried
out
in
front
of
the
house
there
was
nothing
much
to
see
there
a
blinding
sun
rose
right
in
the
puerta
over
the
leagues
and
leagues
of
dark
desert
to
the
east
nothing
lived
but
the
morning
light
not
a
movement
not
a
sound
yet
somewhere
out
there
a
mere
handful
of
men
were
desperately
trying
to
hold
off
an
army
thin
smoke
floated
up
in
the
breathless
air
from
the
houses
of
the
peons
it
was
so
still
that
the
grinding
of
meal
between
two
stones
was
distinctly
the
slow
minor
song
of
some
woman
at
her
work
way
around
the
casa
grande
sheep
were
maaing
to
be
let
out
of
the
corral
on
the
road
to
santo
domingo
so
far
away
that
they
were
mere
colored
accents
in
the
desert
the
four
peddlers
sauntered
behind
their
burros
little
knots
of
peons
were
gathered
in
front
of
the
hacienda
pointing
and
looking
east
and
around
the
gate
of
the
big
enclosure
where
the
soldiers
were
quartered
a
few
troopers
held
their
horses
by
the
bridle
that
was
all
occasionally
the
door
of
the
casa
grande
vomited
mounted
or
three
at
a
galloped
down
the
puerta
road
with
their
rifles
in
their
hands
i
could
follow
them
as
they
rose
and
fell
over
the
waves
of
the
desert
growing
smaller
all
the
time
until
they
mounted
the
last
the
white
dust
they
kicked
up
caught
the
fierce
light
of
the
sun
and
the
eye
couldn
t
stand
it
they
had
taken
my
horse
and
juan
vallejo
didn
t
have
one
he
stood
beside
me
cocking
and
firing
his
empty
rifle
look
he
shouted
suddenly
the
western
face
of
the
mountains
that
flanked
the
puerta
was
in
shadow
still
along
their
base
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
too
wriggled
little
thin
lines
of
dust
they
lengthened
so
slowly
at
first
there
was
only
one
in
each
direction
then
two
others
began
farther
down
nearer
advancing
relentlessly
like
raveling
in
a
a
crack
in
thin
glass
the
enemy
spreading
wide
around
the
battle
to
take
us
in
the
flank
still
the
little
knots
of
troopers
poured
from
the
casa
grande
and
spurred
away
pablo
arriola
went
and
nicanor
waving
to
me
brightly
as
they
passed
longinos
güereca
rocketed
out
on
his
great
horse
yet
only
half
broken
the
big
gray
put
down
his
head
and
four
times
across
the
square
for
the
mines
yelled
gino
over
his
shoulder
i
m
very
busy
lost
mines
but
he
was
too
far
away
for
me
to
hear
martinez
followed
him
shouting
to
me
with
a
grin
that
he
felt
scared
to
death
then
others
it
made
about
thirty
so
far
i
remember
that
most
of
them
wore
automobile
goggles
don
petronilo
sat
his
horse
with
to
his
eyes
i
looked
again
at
the
lines
of
were
curving
slowly
down
the
sun
glorifying
scimitars
don
tomas
galloped
past
gil
tomas
at
his
heels
but
someone
was
coming
a
little
running
horse
appeared
on
the
rise
headed
our
way
the
rider
outlined
in
a
radiant
dust
he
was
going
at
furious
speed
dipping
and
rising
over
the
rolling
land
and
as
he
spurred
wildly
up
the
little
hill
where
we
stood
we
saw
a
horror
a
cascade
of
blood
poured
from
the
front
of
him
the
lower
part
of
his
mouth
was
quite
shot
away
by
a
bullet
he
reined
up
beside
the
colonel
and
tried
earnestly
terribly
to
tell
him
something
but
nothing
intelligible
issued
from
the
ruin
tears
poured
down
the
poor
fellow
s
cheeks
he
gave
a
hoarse
cry
and
driving
his
spurs
deep
in
his
horse
fled
up
the
santo
domingo
road
others
were
coming
too
on
the
dead
who
had
been
the
puerta
guard
two
or
three
passed
right
through
the
hacienda
without
stopping
the
rest
threw
themselves
upon
don
petronilo
in
a
passion
of
rage
more
ammunition
they
cried
more
cartridges
don
petronilo
looked
away
there
isn
t
any
the
men
went
mad
cursing
and
hurling
their
guns
on
the
ground
more
men
at
the
puerta
shouted
the
colonel
in
a
few
minutes
half
of
the
new
men
galloped
out
of
their
cuartel
and
took
the
eastern
road
the
near
ends
of
the
dust
lines
were
now
lost
to
view
behind
a
swell
of
ground
why
don
t
you
send
them
all
don
petronilo
i
yelled
because
my
young
friend
a
whole
company
of
is
riding
down
that
arroyo
you
can
t
see
them
from
there
but
i
can
he
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
a
rider
whirled
around
the
corner
of
the
house
pointing
back
over
his
shoulder
to
the
south
whence
he
had
come
they
re
coming
that
way
too
he
cried
thousands
through
the
other
pass
redondo
had
only
five
men
on
guard
they
took
them
prisoner
and
got
into
the
valley
before
he
knew
it
dios
muttered
don
petronilo
we
turned
south
above
the
umber
rise
of
desert
loomed
a
mighty
cloud
of
white
dust
shining
in
the
sun
like
the
biblical
pillar
of
smoke
the
rest
of
you
fellows
get
out
there
and
hold
them
off
the
last
leaped
to
their
saddles
and
started
southward
then
suddenly
the
great
gate
of
the
walled
square
belched
men
and
without
rifles
the
disarmed
of
salazar
they
milled
around
as
if
in
a
panic
give
us
our
rifles
they
shouted
where
s
our
ammunition
your
rifles
are
in
the
cuartel
answered
the
colonel
but
your
cartridges
are
out
there
killing
a
great
cry
went
up
they
ve
taken
away
our
arms
they
want
to
murder
us
how
can
we
fight
man
what
can
we
do
without
rifles
screamed
one
man
in
don
petronilo
s
face
come
on
let
s
go
out
and
strangle
em
with
our
hands
yelled
one
five
struck
spurs
into
their
horses
and
sped
furiously
toward
the
arms
without
hope
it
was
magnificent
we
ll
all
get
killed
said
another
come
on
and
the
other
swept
wildly
out
on
the
road
to
santo
domingo
the
recruits
that
had
been
ordered
to
hold
the
southern
side
had
ridden
out
about
half
a
mile
and
there
stopped
seeming
uncertain
what
to
do
now
they
caught
sight
of
the
disarmed
fifty
galloping
for
the
mountains
the
are
fleeing
the
are
fleeing
for
a
moment
there
was
a
sharp
exchange
of
cries
they
looked
at
the
dust
cloud
towering
over
them
they
thought
of
the
mighty
army
of
merciless
devils
who
made
it
they
hesitated
fled
furiously
through
the
chaparral
toward
the
mountains
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
had
been
hearing
shooting
for
some
time
it
sounded
immensely
far
nothing
so
much
as
a
clicking
typewriter
even
while
it
held
our
attention
it
grew
the
little
trivial
pricking
of
rifles
deepened
and
became
serious
out
in
front
now
it
was
practically
the
roll
of
a
don
petronilo
was
a
little
white
he
called
apolinario
and
told
him
to
harness
the
mules
to
the
coach
if
anything
happens
that
we
get
the
worst
of
it
he
said
lightly
to
juan
vallejo
call
my
woman
and
you
and
reed
go
with
her
in
the
coach
come
on
silveyra
and
juan
santillanes
spurred
out
the
three
vanished
toward
the
puerta
we
could
see
them
now
hundreds
of
little
black
figures
riding
everywhere
through
the
chaparral
the
desert
swarmed
with
them
savage
indian
yells
reached
us
a
spent
bullet
droned
overhead
then
another
then
one
unspent
and
then
a
whole
flock
singing
fiercely
thud
went
the
adobe
walls
as
bits
of
clay
flew
peons
and
their
women
rushed
from
house
to
house
distracted
with
fear
a
trooper
his
face
black
with
powder
and
hateful
with
killing
and
terror
galloped
past
shouting
that
all
was
lost
apolinario
hurried
out
the
mules
with
their
harness
on
their
backs
and
began
to
hitch
them
to
the
coach
his
hands
trembled
he
dropped
a
trace
picked
it
up
and
dropped
it
again
he
shook
all
over
all
at
once
he
threw
the
harness
to
the
ground
and
took
to
his
heels
juan
and
i
rushed
forward
just
then
a
stray
bullet
took
the
off
mule
in
the
rump
nervous
already
the
animals
plunged
wildly
the
wagon
tongue
snapped
with
the
report
of
a
rifle
the
mules
raced
madly
north
into
the
desert
and
then
came
the
rout
a
wild
huddle
of
troopers
all
together
lashing
their
terrified
horses
they
passed
us
without
stopping
without
noticing
all
blood
and
sweat
and
blackness
don
tomas
pablo
arriola
and
after
them
little
gil
tomas
his
horse
staggering
and
falling
dead
right
in
front
of
us
bullets
whipped
the
wall
on
all
sides
of
us
come
on
meester
said
juan
let
s
go
we
began
to
run
as
i
panted
up
the
steep
opposite
bank
of
the
arroyo
i
looked
back
gil
tomas
was
right
behind
me
with
a
and
serape
round
his
shoulders
don
petronilo
came
in
sight
shooting
back
over
his
shoulder
with
juan
santillanes
at
his
side
in
front
raced
fernando
silveyra
bending
low
over
his
horse
s
neck
all
around
the
hacienda
was
a
ring
of
galloping
shooting
yelling
men
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
every
rise
of
the
desert
came
more
s
juan
vallejo
was
already
far
ahead
running
doggedly
with
his
rifle
in
one
hand
i
shouted
to
him
to
turn
off
the
high
road
and
he
obeyed
without
looking
back
i
followed
it
was
a
straight
path
through
the
desert
toward
the
mountains
the
desert
was
as
bald
as
a
billiard
table
here
we
could
be
seen
for
miles
my
camera
got
between
my
legs
i
dropped
it
my
overcoat
became
a
terrible
weight
i
shook
it
off
we
could
see
the
fleeing
wildly
up
the
santo
domingo
road
beyond
them
unexpectedly
appeared
a
wave
of
galloping
flanking
party
from
the
south
the
shooting
broke
out
then
pursuers
and
pursued
vanished
around
the
corner
of
a
little
hill
thank
god
the
path
was
diverging
from
the
road
i
ran
and
ran
and
ran
until
i
could
run
no
more
then
i
walked
a
few
steps
and
ran
again
i
was
sobbing
instead
of
breathing
awful
cramps
gripped
my
legs
here
there
was
more
chaparral
more
brush
and
the
foothills
of
the
western
mountains
were
near
but
the
entire
length
of
the
path
was
visible
from
behind
juan
vallejo
had
reached
the
foothills
half
a
mile
ahead
i
saw
him
crawling
up
a
little
rise
suddenly
three
armed
horsemen
swept
in
behind
him
and
raised
a
shout
he
looked
around
threw
his
rifle
far
into
the
brush
and
fled
for
his
life
they
shot
at
him
but
stopped
to
recover
the
rifle
he
disappeared
over
the
crest
and
then
they
did
too
i
ran
i
wondered
what
time
it
was
i
wasn
t
very
frightened
everything
still
was
so
unreal
like
a
page
out
of
richard
harding
davis
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
didn
t
get
away
i
wouldn
t
be
doing
my
job
well
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
well
this
is
certainly
an
experience
i
m
going
to
have
something
to
write
about
then
came
yells
and
hoofs
drumming
in
the
rear
about
a
hundred
yards
behind
ran
little
gil
tomas
the
ends
of
his
gay
serape
flying
out
straight
and
about
a
hundred
yards
behind
him
rode
two
black
men
with
crossed
bandoliers
and
rifles
in
their
hands
they
shot
gil
tomas
raised
a
ghastly
little
indian
face
to
me
and
ran
on
again
they
shot
one
bullet
by
my
head
the
boy
staggered
stopped
wheeled
and
doubled
suddenly
into
the
chaparral
they
turned
after
him
i
saw
the
foremost
horse
s
hoofs
strike
him
the
jerked
their
mounts
to
their
haunches
over
him
shooting
down
again
and
again
i
ran
into
the
chaparral
topped
a
little
hill
tripped
on
a
mesquite
root
fell
rolled
down
a
sandy
incline
and
landed
in
a
little
arroyo
dense
mesquite
covered
the
place
before
i
could
stir
the
came
plunging
down
the
hillside
there
he
goes
they
yelled
and
jumping
their
horses
over
the
arroyo
not
ten
feet
from
where
i
lay
galloped
off
into
the
desert
i
suddenly
fell
asleep
i
couldn
t
have
slept
very
long
for
when
i
woke
the
sun
was
still
in
about
the
same
place
and
a
few
scattered
shots
could
be
heard
way
to
the
west
in
the
direction
of
santo
domingo
i
stared
up
through
the
brush
tangle
into
the
hot
sky
where
one
great
vulture
slowly
circled
over
me
wondering
whether
or
not
i
was
dead
not
twenty
paces
away
a
barefooted
indian
with
a
rifle
crouched
on
his
motionless
horse
he
looked
up
at
the
vulture
and
then
searched
the
face
of
the
desert
i
lay
still
i
couldn
t
tell
whether
he
was
one
of
ours
or
not
after
a
little
time
he
jogged
slowly
north
over
a
hill
and
disappeared
i
waited
about
half
an
hour
before
crawling
out
of
the
arroyo
in
the
direction
of
the
hacienda
they
were
still
sure
of
the
dead
i
afterward
learned
i
couldn
t
see
it
the
little
valley
in
which
i
was
ran
roughly
east
and
west
i
traveled
westward
toward
the
sierra
but
it
was
still
too
near
the
fatal
path
i
stooped
low
and
ran
up
over
the
hill
without
looking
back
beyond
was
another
higher
and
then
another
still
running
over
the
hills
walking
in
the
sheltered
valleys
i
bore
steadily
northwest
toward
the
mountains
soon
there
were
no
more
sounds
the
sun
burned
fiercely
down
and
the
long
ridges
of
desolate
country
wavered
in
the
heat
high
chaparral
tore
my
clothes
and
face
underfoot
were
cactuses
century
plants
and
the
murderous
whose
long
interlaced
spikes
slashed
my
boots
drawing
blood
at
every
step
and
beneath
them
sand
and
jagged
stones
it
was
terrible
going
the
big
still
forms
of
spanish
bayonet
astonishingly
like
men
stood
up
all
around
the
skyline
i
stood
stiffly
for
a
moment
on
the
top
of
a
high
hill
in
a
clump
of
them
looking
back
the
hacienda
was
already
so
far
away
that
it
was
only
a
white
blur
in
the
immeasurable
reaches
of
the
desert
a
thin
line
of
dust
moved
from
it
toward
the
taking
back
their
dead
to
mapimi
then
my
heart
gave
a
jump
a
man
was
coming
silently
up
the
valley
he
had
a
green
serape
over
one
arm
and
nothing
on
his
head
but
a
handkerchief
his
bare
legs
were
covered
with
blood
from
the
he
caught
sight
of
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
stood
still
after
a
pause
he
beckoned
i
went
down
to
where
he
was
he
never
said
a
word
but
led
the
way
back
down
the
valley
about
a
hundred
yards
farther
he
stopped
and
pointed
a
dead
horse
sprawled
in
the
sand
its
stiff
legs
in
the
air
beside
it
lay
a
man
disemboweled
by
a
knife
or
a
a
because
his
was
almost
full
the
man
with
the
green
serape
produced
a
dagger
still
ruddy
with
blood
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
dig
among
the
i
brought
rocks
we
cut
a
branch
of
mesquite
and
made
a
cleft
cross
out
of
it
and
so
we
buried
him
where
are
you
bound
i
asked
for
the
sierra
he
answered
and
you
i
pointed
north
where
i
knew
the
güerecas
ranch
lay
the
pelayo
is
over
that
leagues
what
is
the
pelayo
another
hacienda
there
are
some
of
ours
at
the
pelayo
i
think
we
parted
with
an
for
hours
i
went
on
running
over
the
hilltops
staggering
through
the
cruel
slipping
down
the
steep
sides
of
dried
river
beds
there
was
no
water
i
hadn
t
eaten
or
drunk
it
was
intensely
hot
about
eleven
i
rounded
the
shoulder
of
a
mountain
and
saw
the
small
gray
patch
that
was
bruquilla
here
passed
the
camino
real
and
the
desert
lay
flat
and
open
a
mile
away
a
tiny
horseman
jogged
along
he
seemed
to
see
me
he
pulled
up
short
and
looked
in
my
direction
a
long
time
i
stood
perfectly
motionless
pretty
soon
he
went
on
getting
smaller
and
smaller
until
at
last
there
was
nothing
but
a
little
puff
of
dust
there
was
no
other
sign
of
life
for
miles
and
miles
i
bent
low
and
ran
along
the
side
of
the
road
where
there
was
no
dust
half
a
league
westward
lay
the
güereca
s
house
hidden
in
the
gigantic
row
of
alamo
trees
that
fringed
its
running
brook
a
long
way
off
i
could
see
a
little
red
spot
on
the
top
of
the
low
hill
beside
it
when
i
came
nearer
i
saw
it
was
father
güereca
staring
toward
the
east
he
came
running
down
when
he
saw
me
clenching
his
hands
what
has
passed
what
has
passed
is
it
true
that
the
have
taken
the
cadena
i
told
him
briefly
what
had
happened
and
longinos
he
cried
wrenching
at
my
arm
have

seen
longinos

i
said
the

the
old
man
trembling
let
me
have
some
can
hardly
speak
yes
yes
drink
there
is
the
brook
the
must
not
find
you
here
the
old
man
looked
around
with
anguish
at
the
little
rancho
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
gain
they
would
destroy
us
all
just
then
the
old
mother
appeared
in
the
doorway
come
here
juan
reed
she
cried
where
is
my
boy

t
he

breakfasted
i
haven
t
had
a
drop
of
water
since
last
night
nor
any
food
and
i
came
all
the
way
from
la
cadena
on
foot
poor
little
boy
poor
little
boy
she
wailed
putting
her
arms
around
me
sit
down
now
and
i
will
cook
you
something
old
güereca
bit
his
lip
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
finally
hospitality
won
my
house
is
at
your
orders
he
muttered
but
hurry
hurry
you
must
not
be
seen
here
i
will
go
up
on
the
hill
and
watch
for
dust
i
drank
several
quarts
of
water
and
ate
four
fried
eggs
and
some
cheese
the
old
man
had
returned
and
was
fidgeting
around
i
sent
all
my
children
to
jarral
grande
he
said
we
heard
this
morning
the
whole
valley
is
fleeing
to
the
mountains
are
you
ready
stay
here
invited
the
señora
we
will
hide
you
from
the
until
longinos
comes
home
her
husband
screamed
at
her
are
you
mad
he
mustn
t
be
found
here
are
you
ready
now
come
on
then
i
limped
along
down
through
a
burnt
yellow
cornfield
follow
this
path
said
the
old
man
through
those
two
fields
and
the
chaparral
it
will
take
you
to
the
highroad
to
the
pelayo
may
you
go
well
we
shook
hands
and
a
moment
later
i
saw
him
shuffling
back
up
the
hill
with
flapping
sandals
i
crossed
an
immense
valley
covered
with
mesquite
as
high
as
my
head
twice
horsemen
passed
probably
only
but
i
took
no
chances
beyond
that
valley
lay
another
about
seven
miles
long
now
there
were
bare
mountains
all
around
and
ahead
loomed
a
range
of
fantastic
white
pink
and
yellow
hills
after
about
four
hours
with
stiff
legs
and
bloody
feet
a
backache
and
a
spinning
head
i
rounded
these
and
came
in
sight
of
the
alamo
trees
and
low
adobe
walls
of
the
hacienda
del
pelayo
the
peons
gathered
around
listening
to
my
story
they
murmured
but
it
is
impossible
to
walk
from
la
cadena
in
one
day
you
must
be
tired
come
now
and
eat
and
there
will
be
a
bed
my
house
is
yours
said
don
felipe
the
blacksmith
but
are
you
quite
sure
the
are
not
coming
this
way
the
last
time
they
paid
us
a
visit
he
pointed
to
the
blackened
walls
of
the
casa
grande
they
killed
four
who
refused
to
join
them
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
come
now
and
eat
if
there
were
only
some
place
to
bathe
first
at
this
they
smiled
and
led
me
behind
the
hacienda
along
a
little
stream
overhung
with
willows
whose
banks
were
the
most
vivid
green
the
water
gushed
out
from
under
a
high
wall
and
over
that
wall
reared
the
gnarled
branches
of
a
giant
alamo
we
entered
a
little
door
there
they
left
me
the
ground
inside
sloped
sharply
up
and
the
was
faded
the
contour
of
the
land
sunk
in
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
was
a
pool
of
crystal
water
the
bottom
was
white
sand
at
one
end
of
the
pool
the
water
fountained
up
from
a
hole
in
the
bottom
a
faint
steam
rose
from
the
surface
it
was
hot
water
there
was
a
man
already
standing
up
to
his
neck
in
the
water
a
man
with
a
circle
shaved
on
the
top
of
his
head
señor
he
said
are
you
a
catholic
no
thank
god
he
returned
briefly
we
catholics
are
liable
to
be
intolerant
are
you
a
mexican
no
señor
it
is
well
he
said
smiling
sadly
i
am
a
priest
and
a
spaniard
i
have
been
made
to
understand
that
i
am
not
wanted
in
this
beautiful
land
señor
god
is
good
but
he
is
better
in
spain
than
he
is
in
mexico
i
let
myself
slowly
down
into
the
pellucid
hot
depths
the
pain
and
the
soreness
and
the
weariness
fled
shuddering
up
my
body
i
felt
like
a
disembodied
spirit
floating
there
in
the
warm
embrace
of
that
marvelous
pool
with
the
crooked
gray
branches
of
the
alamo
above
our
heads
we
discussed
philosophy
the
fierce
sky
cooled
slowly
and
the
rich
sunlight
climbed
little
by
little
up
the
pink
wall
don
felipe
insisted
that
i
sleep
in
his
house
in
his
bed
this
bed
consisted
of
an
iron
frame
with
loose
wooden
slats
stretched
across
it
over
these
was
laid
one
tattered
blanket
my
clothing
covered
me
don
felipe
his
wife
his
grown
son
and
daughter
his
two
small
infants
all
of
whom
had
been
accustomed
to
use
the
bed
lay
down
upon
the
soft
floor
there
were
also
two
sick
persons
in
the
very
old
man
covered
with
red
spots
too
far
gone
to
speak
and
a
boy
with
extraordinarily
swollen
tonsils
occasionally
a
centenarian
hag
entered
and
ministered
unto
the
patients
her
method
of
treatment
was
simple
with
the
old
man
she
merely
heated
a
piece
of
iron
at
the
candle
and
touched
the
spots
for
the
boy
s
case
she
made
a
paste
of
and
lard
and
gently
rubbed
his
elbows
with
it
loudly
saying
prayers
this
went
on
at
intervals
all
night
between
treatments
the
babies
would
wake
up
at
intervals
and
insist
upon
being
nursed
the
door
was
shut
early
in
the
evening
and
windows
there
were
none
now
all
this
hospitality
meant
a
real
sacrifice
to
don
felipe
especially
the
meals
at
which
he
unlocked
a
tin
trunk
and
brought
me
with
all
reverence
his
precious
sugar
and
coffee
he
was
like
all
peons
incredibly
poor
and
lavishly
hospitable
the
giving
up
of
his
bed
was
a
mark
of
the
highest
honor
too
but
when
i
tried
to
pay
him
in
the
morning
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
my
house
is
yours
he
repeated
a
stranger
might
be
god
as
we
say
finally
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
him
to
buy
me
some
tobacco
and
he
took
the
money
i
knew
then
that
it
would
go
to
the
right
place
for
a
mexican
can
be
trusted
never
to
carry
out
a
commission
he
is
delightfully
irresponsible
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
set
out
for
santo
domingo
in
a
cart
driven
by
an
old
peon
named
froilan
mendarez
we
avoided
the
main
road
jolting
along
by
a
mere
track
that
led
behind
a
range
of
hills
after
we
d
traveled
for
about
an
hour
i
had
an
unpleasant
thought
what
if
the
fled
beyond
santo
domingo
and
the
are
there
what
indeed
murmured
froilan
chirruping
to
the
mule
but
if
they
are
what
ll
we
do
froilan
thought
a
minute
we
might
say
we
were
cousins
to
president
huerta
he
suggested
without
a
smile
froilan
was
a
barefooted
peon
his
face
and
hands
incredibly
damaged
by
age
and
dirt
i
was
a
ragged
gringo
we
jogged
on
for
several
hours
at
one
place
an
armed
man
started
out
of
the
brush
and
hailed
us
his
lips
were
split
and
leathery
with
thirst
the
had
slashed
his
legs
terribly
he
had
escaped
over
the
sierra
climbing
and
slipping
all
night
we
gave
him
all
the
water
and
food
we
had
and
he
went
on
toward
the
pelayo
long
after
noon
our
cart
topped
the
last
desert
rise
and
we
saw
sleeping
below
us
the
long
hacienda
of
santo
domingo
with
its
clump
of
tall
alamos
like
palm
trees
around
the
spring
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
as
we
drove
down
in
the
big
court
the
peons
were
playing
hand
ball
up
from
the
spring
moved
the
long
line
of
water
carriers
a
fire
sent
up
thin
smoke
among
the
trees
we
came
upon
an
aged
peon
carrying
fagots
no
he
said
there
had
been
no
the
maderistas
yes
they
had
come
last
of
them
all
running
but
at
dawn
they
had
gone
back
to
la
cadena
to
lift
the
fields
bury
the
dead
from
around
the
fire
under
the
alamos
came
a
great
shout
the
meester
here
comes
the
meester
tal
how
did
you
escape
it
was
my
old
friends
the
peddlers
they
crowded
around
eagerly
questioning
shaking
my
hand
throwing
their
arms
around
me
ah
but
that
was
close
but
i
was
lucky
did
i
know
that
longinos
güereca
was
killed
yes
but
he
shot
six
before
they
got
him
and
martinez
also
and
nicanor
and
redondo
i
felt
sick
sick
to
think
of
so
many
useless
deaths
in
such
a
petty
fight
blithe
beautiful
martinez
gino
güereca
whom
i
had
learned
to
love
so
much
redondo
whose
girl
was
even
then
on
her
way
to
chihuahua
to
buy
her
wedding
dress
and
jolly
nicanor
it
seems
that
when
redondo
found
that
his
flank
had
been
turned
his
troop
deserted
him
so
he
galloped
alone
toward
la
cadena
and
was
caught
by
three
hundred
they
literally
shot
him
to
pieces
gino
and
luis
martinez
and
nicanor
with
five
others
held
the
eastward
side
of
the
hacienda
unaided
until
their
cartridges
were
gone
and
they
were
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
shooting
men
then
they
died
the
carried
off
the
colonel
s
woman
but
there
s
a
man
who
s
been
through
it
all
said
one
of
the
peddlers
he
fought
till
his
last
cartridge
was
gone
and
then
cut
his
way
through
the
enemy
with
a
saber
i
looked
around
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
gaping
peons
his
lifted
arm
illustrating
the
great
deed
he
caught
sight
of
me
nodded
coldly
as
to
one
who
has
run
from
the
fight
and
went
on
with
his
recital
all
through
the
long
afternoon
froilan
and
i
played
with
the
peons
it
was
a
drowsy
peaceful
day
a
gentle
wind
rustled
the
high
branches
of
the
great
trees
and
the
late
sun
from
behind
the
hill
that
is
back
of
santo
domingo
warmed
with
color
their
lofty
tops
it
was
a
strange
sunset
the
sky
became
overcast
with
light
cloud
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
first
it
turned
pink
then
scarlet
then
of
a
sudden
the
whole
firmament
became
a
deep
bloody
red
an
immense
drunken
indian
about
seven
feet
out
in
the
open
ground
near
the
court
with
a
violin
in
his
hand
he
tucked
it
under
his
chin
and
sawed
raggedly
on
the
strings
staggering
to
and
fro
as
he
played
then
a
little
dwarf
sprang
out
of
the
crowd
of
peons
and
began
to
dance
a
dense
throng
made
a
circle
around
the
two
roaring
with
mirth
and
just
at
that
moment
there
appeared
against
the
bloody
sky
over
the
eastern
hill
the
broken
defeated
horseback
and
on
foot
wounded
and
whole
weary
sick
disheartened
reeling
and
limping
down
to
santo
domingo
so
against
a
crimson
sky
the
beaten
exhausted
soldiers
came
down
the
hill
some
rode
their
horses
hanging
weary
two
on
a
horse
others
walked
with
bloody
bandages
around
their
foreheads
and
arms
were
empty
rifles
gone
their
hands
and
faces
were
foul
with
sweaty
dirt
and
stained
still
with
powder
beyond
the
hill
across
the
arid
waste
that
lay
between
us
and
la
cadena
they
straggled
there
were
not
more
than
fifty
left
including
the
rest
had
dispersed
in
the
barren
mountains
and
the
folds
of
the
they
stretched
out
for
miles
it
took
hours
for
them
to
arrive
don
petronilo
came
in
front
with
lowered
face
and
folded
arms
the
reins
hanging
loose
upon
the
neck
of
his
swaying
stumbling
horse
right
behind
him
came
juan
santillanes
gaunt
and
white
his
face
years
older
fernando
silveyra
all
rags
dragged
along
at
his
saddle
as
they
waded
the
shallow
stream
they
looked
up
and
saw
me
don
petronilo
weakly
waved
his
hand
fernando
shouted
why
there
s
meester
how
did
you
escape
we
thought
sure
they
had
shot
you
i
ran
a
race
with
the
goats
i
answered
juan
gave
a
laugh
scared
to
death
eh
the
horses
thrust
eager
muzzles
into
the
stream
sucking
fiercely
juan
cruelly
spurred
across
and
we
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
but
don
petronilo
dismounted
in
the
water
dully
as
if
in
a
dream
and
wading
up
to
the
tops
of
his
boots
came
to
where
i
was
he
was
weeping
his
expression
didn
t
change
but
slow
big
tears
fell
silently
down
his
cheeks
the
captured
his
wife
murmured
juan
in
my
ear
i
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
man
it
is
a
terrible
thing
i
said
gently
to
feel
the
responsibility
for
all
these
brave
fellows
who
died
but
it
was
not
your
fault
it
is
not
that
he
replied
slowly
staring
through
tears
at
the
pitiful
company
crawling
down
from
the
desert
i
too
had
many
friends
who
died
in
the
battle
i
went
on
but
they
died
gloriously
fighting
for
their
country
i
do
not
weep
for
them
he
said
twisting
his
hands
together
this
day
i
have
lost
all
that
is
dear
to
me
they
took
my
woman
who
was
mine
and
my
commission
and
all
my
papers
and
all
my
money
but
i
am
wrenched
with
grief
when
i
think
of
my
silver
spurs
inlaid
with
gold
which
i
bought
only
last
year
in
mapimi
he
turned
away
overcome
and
now
the
peons
began
to
come
down
from
their
houses
with
pitying
cries
and
loving
offers
they
threw
their
arms
around
the
soldiers
necks
assisting
the
wounded
patting
them
shyly
on
the
shoulders
and
calling
them
brave
desperately
poor
themselves
they
offered
food
and
beds
and
fodder
for
the
horses
inviting
them
to
stay
at
santo
domingo
until
they
should
become
well
i
already
had
a
place
to
sleep
don
pedro
the
chief
goatherd
had
given
me
his
room
and
his
bed
in
a
gush
of
generosity
and
had
removed
himself
and
his
family
to
the
kitchen
he
did
so
without
hope
of
recompense
for
he
thought
i
had
no
money
and
now
everywhere
men
women
and
children
left
their
houses
to
make
way
for
the
defeated
and
weary
troops
fernando
juan
and
i
went
over
and
begged
some
tobacco
from
the
four
peddlers
camped
under
the
trees
beside
the
spring
they
had
made
no
sales
for
a
week
and
were
almost
starving
but
they
loaded
us
lavishly
with
we
talked
of
the
battle
lying
there
on
our
elbows
watching
the
shattered
remnants
of
the
garrison
top
the
hill
you
have
heard
that
gino
güereca
fell
said
fernando
well
i
saw
him
his
big
gray
horse
that
he
rode
for
the
first
time
was
terrified
by
the
bridle
and
saddle
but
once
he
came
where
the
bullets
were
flying
and
the
guns
roaring
he
steadied
at
once
pure
race
that
horse
his
fathers
must
have
been
all
warriors
around
gino
were
four
or
five
more
heroes
with
almost
all
their
cartridges
gone
they
fought
until
on
the
front
and
on
both
sides
double
galloping
lines
of
closed
in
gino
was
standing
beside
his
a
score
of
shots
hit
the
animal
all
at
once
and
he
sighed
and
fell
over
the
rest
ceased
firing
in
a
sort
of
panic
we
re
lost
they
cried
run
while
there
is
yet
a
chance
gino
shook
his
smoking
rifle
at
them
no
he
shouted
give
the
time
to
get
away
shortly
after
that
they
closed
around
him
and
i
never
saw
him
until
we
buried
his
body
this
morning
it
was
the
devil
s
hell
out
there
the
rifles
were
so
hot
you
couldn
t
touch
the
barrels
and
the
whirling
haze
that
belched
out
when
they
shot
twisted
everything
like
a
mirage
juan
broke
in
we
rode
straight
out
toward
the
puerta
when
the
retreat
began
but
almost
immediately
we
saw
it
was
no
use
the
broke
over
our
little
handfuls
of
men
like
waves
of
the
sea
martinez
was
just
ahead
he
never
had
a
chance
even
to
fire
his
this
was
his
first
battle
too
they
hit
him
as
he
rode
i
thought
how
you
and
martinez
loved
each
other
you
used
to
talk
together
at
night
so
warmly
and
never
wished
to
leave
each
other
to
sleep
now
the
tall
naked
tops
of
the
trees
had
dulled
with
the
passing
of
the
light
and
seemed
to
stand
still
the
swarming
stars
in
the
deep
dome
overhead
the
peddlers
had
kindled
their
tiny
fire
the
low
contented
murmur
of
their
gossip
floated
to
us
open
doors
of
the
peons
huts
shed
wavering
candlelight
up
from
the
river
wound
a
silent
line
of
girls
with
on
their
heads
women
ground
their
with
a
monotonous
stony
scraping
dogs
barked
drumming
hoofs
marked
the
passing
of
the
to
the
river
along
the
ledge
in
front
of
don
pedro
s
house
the
warriors
smoked
and
fought
the
battle
over
again
stamping
around
and
shouting
descriptive
matter
i
took
my
rifle
by
the
barrel
and
smashed
in
his
grinning
face
just
some
one
was
narrating
with
gestures
the
peons
squatted
around
breathlessly
listening
and
still
the
ghastly
procession
of
the
defeated
straggled
down
the
road
and
across
the
river
it
was
not
yet
quite
dark
i
wandered
down
to
the
bank
to
watch
them
in
the
vague
hope
of
finding
some
of
my
who
were
still
reported
missing
and
it
was
there
that
i
first
saw
elizabetta
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
her
i
think
i
noticed
her
chiefly
because
she
was
one
of
the
few
women
in
that
wretched
company
she
was
a
very
indian
girl
about
years
old
with
the
squat
figure
of
her
drudging
race
pleasant
features
hair
hanging
forward
over
her
shoulders
in
two
long
plaits
and
big
shining
teeth
when
she
smiled
i
never
did
find
out
whether
she
had
been
just
a
peon
woman
working
around
la
cadena
when
the
attack
had
come
or
whether
she
was
a
camp
follower
of
the
army
now
she
was
trudging
stolidly
along
in
the
dust
behind
captain
felix
romero
s
had
trudged
so
for
thirty
miles
he
never
spoke
to
her
never
looked
back
but
rode
on
unconcernedly
sometimes
he
would
get
tired
of
carrying
his
rifle
and
hand
it
back
to
her
to
carry
with
a
careless
here
take
this
i
found
out
later
that
when
they
returned
to
la
cadena
after
the
battle
to
bury
the
dead
he
had
found
her
wandering
aimlessly
in
the
hacienda
apparently
out
of
her
mind
and
that
needing
a
woman
he
had
ordered
her
to
follow
him
which
she
did
unquestioningly
after
the
custom
of
her
sex
and
country
captain
felix
let
his
horse
drink
elizabetta
halted
too
knelt
and
plunged
her
face
into
the
water
come
on
ordered
the
captain
she
rose
without
a
word
and
waded
through
the
stream
in
the
same
order
they
climbed
the
near
bank
and
there
the
captain
dismounted
held
out
his
hand
for
the
rifle
she
carried
and
said
get
me
my
supper
then
he
strolled
away
toward
the
houses
where
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
sat
elizabetta
fell
upon
her
knees
and
gathered
twigs
for
her
fire
soon
there
was
a
little
pile
burning
she
called
a
small
boy
in
the
harsh
whining
voice
that
all
mexican
women
have
fetch
me
a
little
water
and
corn
that
i
may
feed
my
man
and
rising
upon
her
knees
above
the
red
glow
of
the
flames
she
shook
down
her
long
straight
black
hair
she
wore
a
sort
of
blouse
of
faded
light
blue
rough
cloth
there
was
dried
blood
on
the
breast
of
it
what
a
battle
señorita
i
said
to
her
her
teeth
flashed
as
she
smiled
and
yet
there
was
a
puzzling
vacancy
about
her
expression
indians
have
faces
under
it
i
could
see
that
she
was
desperately
tired
and
even
a
little
hysterical
but
she
spoke
tranquilly
enough
perfectly
she
said
are
you
the
gringo
who
ran
so
many
miles
with
the
after
you
shooting
and
she
her
breath
in
the
middle
of
it
as
if
it
hurt
the
shambled
up
with
an
earthen
jar
of
water
and
an
armful
of
that
he
tumbled
at
her
feet
elizabetta
unwound
from
her
shawl
the
heavy
little
stone
trough
that
mexican
women
carry
and
began
mechanically
husking
the
corn
into
it
i
do
not
remember
seeing
you
at
la
cadena
i
said
were
you
there
long
too
long
she
answered
simply
without
raising
her
head
and
then
suddenly
oh
but
this
war
is
no
game
for
women
she
cried
don
felix
loomed
up
out
of
the
dark
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
my
dinner
he
growled
is
it
luego
she
answered
he
went
away
again
listen
señor
whoever
you
are
said
elizabetta
swiftly
looking
up
to
me
my
lover
was
killed
yesterday
in
the
battle
this
man
is
my
man
but
by
god
and
all
the
saints
i
can
t
sleep
with
him
this
night
let
me
stay
then
with
you
there
wasn
t
a
trace
of
coquetry
in
her
voice
this
blundering
childish
spirit
had
found
itself
in
a
situation
it
couldn
t
bear
and
had
chosen
the
instinctive
way
out
i
doubt
if
she
even
knew
herself
why
the
thought
of
this
new
man
so
revolted
her
with
her
lover
scarcely
cold
in
the
ground
i
was
nothing
to
her
nor
she
to
me
that
was
all
that
mattered
i
assented
and
together
we
left
the
fire
the
captain
s
neglected
corn
spilling
from
the
stone
trough
and
then
we
met
him
a
few
feet
into
the
darkness
my
dinner
he
said
impatiently
his
voice
changed
where
are
you
going
i
m
going
with
this
señor
elizabetta
answered
nervously
i
m
going
to
stay
with
began
don
felix
gulping
you
are
my
woman
señor
this
is
my
woman
here
yes
i
said
she
is
your
woman
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
but
she
is
very
tired
and
not
well
and
i
have
offered
her
my
bed
for
the
night
this
is
very
bad
señor
exclaimed
the
captain
in
a
tightening
voice
you
are
the
guest
of
this
tropa
and
the
colonel
s
friend
but
this
is
my
woman
and
i
want
oh
elizabetta
cried
out
until
the
next
time
señor
she
caught
my
arm
and
pulled
me
on
we
had
been
living
in
a
nightmare
of
battle
and
of
us
i
think
everybody
was
a
little
dazed
and
excited
i
know
i
was
by
this
time
the
peons
and
soldiers
had
begun
to
gather
around
us
and
as
we
went
on
the
captain
s
voice
rose
as
he
retailed
his
injustice
to
the
crowd
i
shall
appeal
to
the
colonel
he
was
saying
i
shall
tell
the
colonel
he
passed
us
going
toward
the
colonel
s
cuartel
with
averted
mumbling
face
mi
coronel
he
cried
this
gringo
has
taken
away
my
woman
it
is
the
grossest
insult
well
returned
the
colonel
calmly
if
they
both
want
to
go
i
guess
there
isn
t
anything
we
can
do
about
it
eh
the
news
had
traveled
like
light
a
throng
of
small
boys
followed
us
close
behind
shouting
the
joyful
indelicacies
they
shout
behind
rustic
wedding
parties
we
passed
the
ledge
where
the
soldiers
and
the
wounded
sat
grinning
and
making
rough
genial
remarks
as
at
a
marriage
it
was
not
coarse
or
suggestive
their
banter
it
was
frank
and
happy
they
were
honestly
glad
for
us
as
we
approached
don
pedro
s
house
we
were
aware
of
many
candles
within
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
were
busy
with
brooms
sweeping
and
resweeping
the
earthen
floor
and
sprinkling
it
with
water
they
had
put
new
linen
on
the
bed
and
lit
the
rush
candle
before
the
table
altar
of
the
virgin
over
the
doorway
hung
a
festoon
of
paper
blossoms
faded
relics
of
many
a
christmas
eve
it
was
winter
and
there
were
no
real
flowers
don
pedro
was
radiant
with
smiles
it
made
no
difference
who
we
were
or
what
our
relation
was
here
were
a
man
and
a
maid
and
to
him
it
was
a
bridal
may
you
have
a
happy
night
he
said
softly
and
closed
the
door
the
frugal
elizabetta
immediately
made
the
rounds
of
the
room
extinguishing
all
the
candles
but
one
and
then
outside
we
heard
music
beginning
to
tune
up
some
one
had
hired
the
village
orchestra
to
serenade
us
late
into
the
night
they
played
steadily
right
outside
our
door
in
the
next
house
we
heard
them
moving
chairs
and
tables
out
of
the
way
and
just
before
i
went
to
sleep
they
began
to
dance
there
economically
combining
a
serenade
with
a
without
the
least
embarrassment
elizabetta
lay
down
beside
me
on
the
bed
her
hand
reached
for
mine
she
snuggled
against
my
body
for
the
comforting
human
warmth
of
it
murmured
until
morning
and
went
to
sleep
and
calmly
sweetly
sleep
came
to
me
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
she
was
gone
i
opened
my
door
and
looked
out
morning
had
come
dazzlingly
all
blue
and
heaven
of
big
white
clouds
and
windy
sky
and
the
desert
brazen
and
luminous
under
the
ashy
bare
trees
the
peddlers
morning
fire
leaped
horizontal
in
the
wind
the
black
women
with
draperies
crossed
the
open
ground
to
the
river
in
single
file
with
red
on
their
heads
cocks
crew
goats
clamored
for
milking
and
a
hundred
horses
drummed
up
the
dust
as
they
were
driven
to
water
elizabetta
was
squatted
over
a
little
fire
near
the
corner
of
the
house
patting
for
the
captain
s
breakfast
she
smiled
as
i
came
up
and
politely
asked
me
if
i
had
slept
well
she
was
quite
contented
now
you
knew
from
the
way
she
sang
over
her
work
presently
the
captain
came
up
in
a
surly
manner
and
nodded
briefly
to
me
i
hope
it
s
ready
now
he
grunted
taking
the
she
gave
him
you
take
a
long
time
to
cook
a
little
breakfast
why
is
there
no
coffee
he
moved
off
munching
get
ready
he
flung
back
over
his
shoulder
we
go
north
in
an
hour

you
going
i
asked
curiously
elizabetta
looked
at
me
with
eyes
of
course
i
am
going
is
he
not
my
man
she
looked
after
him
admiringly
she
was
no
longer
revolted
he
is
my
man
she
said
he
is
very
handsome
and
very
brave
why
in
the
battle
the
other
elizabetta
had
forgotten
her
lover
accepts
a
it
was
while
villa
was
in
chihuahua
city
two
weeks
before
the
advance
on
torreon
that
the
artillery
corps
of
his
army
decided
to
present
him
with
a
gold
medal
for
personal
heroism
on
the
field
in
the
audience
hall
of
the
governor
s
palace
in
chihuahua
a
place
of
ceremonial
great
luster
chandeliers
heavy
crimson
portières
and
gaudy
american
wallpaper
there
is
a
throne
for
the
governor
it
is
a
gilded
chair
with
lion
s
claws
for
arms
placed
upon
a
dais
under
a
canopy
of
crimson
velvet
surmounted
by
a
heavy
gilded
wooden
cap
which
tapers
up
to
a
crown
the
officers
of
artillery
in
smart
blue
uniforms
faced
with
black
velvet
and
gold
were
solidly
banked
across
one
end
of
the
audience
hall
with
flashing
new
swords
and
their
hats
stiffly
held
under
their
arms
from
the
door
of
that
chamber
around
the
gallery
down
the
state
staircase
across
the
grandiose
inner
court
of
the
palace
and
out
through
the
imposing
gates
to
the
street
stood
a
double
line
of
soldiers
with
their
rifles
at
present
arms
four
regimental
bands
grouped
in
one
wedged
in
the
crowd
the
people
of
the
capital
were
massed
in
solid
thousands
on
the
plaza
de
armas
before
the
palace
viene
here
he
comes
viva
villa
viva
madero
villa
the
friend
of
the
poor
the
roar
began
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
and
swept
like
fire
in
heavy
growing
crescendo
until
it
seemed
to
toss
thousands
of
hats
above
their
heads
the
band
in
the
courtyard
struck
up
the
mexican
national
air
and
villa
came
walking
down
the
street
he
was
dressed
in
an
old
plain
khaki
uniform
with
several
buttons
lacking
he
hadn
t
recently
shaved
wore
no
hat
and
his
hair
had
not
been
brushed
he
walked
a
little
humped
over
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
as
he
entered
the
aisle
between
the
rigid
lines
of
soldiers
he
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
and
grinned
and
nodded
to
a
here
and
there
in
the
ranks
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
governor
chao
and
secretary
of
state
terrazzas
joined
him
in
uniform
the
band
threw
off
all
restraint
and
as
villa
entered
the
audience
chamber
at
a
signal
from
someone
in
the
balcony
of
the
palace
the
great
throng
in
the
plaza
de
armas
uncovered
and
all
the
brilliant
crowd
of
officers
in
the
room
saluted
stiffly
it
was
napoleonic
villa
hesitated
for
a
minute
pulling
his
mustache
and
looking
very
uncomfortable
finally
gravitated
toward
the
throne
which
he
tested
by
shaking
the
arms
and
then
sat
down
with
the
governor
on
his
right
and
the
secretary
of
state
on
his
left
señor
bauche
alcalde
stepped
forward
raised
his
right
hand
to
the
exact
position
which
cicero
took
when
denouncing
catiline
and
pronounced
a
short
discourse
indicting
villa
for
personal
bravery
on
the
field
on
six
counts
which
he
mentioned
in
florid
detail
he
was
followed
by
the
chief
of
artillery
who
said
the
army
adores
you
we
will
follow
you
wherever
you
lead
you
can
be
what
you
desire
in
mexico
then
three
other
officers
spoke
in
the
extravagant
periods
necessary
to
mexican
oratory
they
called
him
the
friend
of
the
poor
the
invincible
general
the
inspirer
of
courage
and
patriotism
the
hope
of
the
indian
republic
and
through
it
all
villa
slouched
on
the
throne
his
mouth
hanging
open
his
little
shrewd
eyes
playing
around
the
room
once
or
twice
he
yawned
but
for
the
most
part
he
seemed
to
be
speculating
with
some
intense
interior
amusement
like
a
small
boy
in
church
what
it
was
all
about
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
and
perhaps
felt
a
slight
vanity
that
all
this
conventional
ceremonial
was
addressed
to
him
but
it
bored
him
just
the
same
finally
with
an
impressive
gesture
colonel
servin
stepped
forward
with
the
small
pasteboard
box
which
held
the
medal
general
chao
nudged
villa
who
stood
up
the
officers
applauded
violently
the
crowd
outside
cheered
the
band
in
the
court
burst
into
a
triumphant
march
villa
put
put
both
hands
eagerly
like
a
child
for
a
new
toy
he
could
hardly
wait
to
open
the
box
and
see
what
was
inside
an
expectant
hush
fell
upon
everyone
even
the
crowd
in
the
square
villa
looked
at
the
medal
scratching
his
head
and
in
a
reverent
silence
said
clearly
this
is
a
hell
of
a
little
thing
to
give
a
man
for
all
that
heroism
you
are
talking
about
and
the
bubble
of
empire
was
pricked
then
and
there
with
a
great
shout
of
laughter
they
waited
for
him
to
make
a
conventional
address
of
acceptance
but
as
he
looked
around
the
room
at
those
brilliant
educated
men
who
said
that
they
would
die
for
villa
the
peon
and
meant
it
and
as
he
caught
sight
through
the
door
of
the
ragged
soldiers
who
had
forgotten
their
rigidity
and
were
crowding
eagerly
into
the
corridor
with
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
the
that
they
loved
he
realized
something
of
what
the
revolution
signified
puckering
up
his
face
as
he
did
always
when
he
concentrated
intensely
he
leaned
across
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
poured
out
in
a
voice
so
low
that
people
could
hardly
hear
there
is
no
word
to
speak
all
i
can
say
is
my
heart
is
all
to
you
then
he
nudged
chao
and
sat
down
spitting
violently
on
the
floor
and
chao
pronounced
the
classic
discourse
rise
of
a
villa
was
an
outlaw
for
years
when
he
was
only
a
boy
of
sixteen
delivering
milk
in
the
streets
of
chihuahua
he
killed
a
government
official
and
had
to
take
to
the
mountains
the
story
is
that
the
official
had
violated
his
sister
but
it
seems
probable
that
villa
killed
him
on
account
of
his
insufferable
insolence
that
in
itself
would
not
have
outlawed
him
long
in
mexico
where
human
life
is
cheap
but
once
a
refugee
he
committed
the
unpardonable
crime
of
stealing
cattle
from
the
rich
and
from
that
time
to
the
outbreak
of
the
madero
revolution
the
mexican
government
had
a
price
on
his
head
villa
was
the
son
of
ignorant
peons
he
had
never
been
to
school
he
hadn
t
the
slightest
conception
of
the
complexity
of
civilization
and
when
he
finally
came
back
to
it
a
mature
man
of
extraordinary
native
shrewdness
he
encountered
the
twentieth
century
with
the
naïve
simplicity
of
a
savage
it
is
almost
impossible
to
procure
accurate
information
about
his
career
as
a
bandit
there
are
accounts
of
outrages
he
committed
in
old
files
of
local
newspapers
and
government
reports
but
those
sources
are
prejudiced
and
his
name
became
so
prominent
as
a
bandit
that
every
train
robbery
and
and
murder
in
northern
mexico
was
attributed
to
villa
but
an
immense
body
of
popular
legend
grew
up
among
the
peons
around
his
name
there
are
many
traditional
songs
and
ballads
celebrating
his
can
hear
the
shepherds
singing
them
around
their
fires
in
the
mountains
at
night
repeating
verses
handed
down
by
their
fathers
or
composing
others
extemporaneously
for
instance
they
tell
the
story
of
how
villa
fired
by
the
story
of
the
misery
of
the
peons
on
the
hacienda
of
los
alamos
gathered
a
small
army
and
descended
upon
the
big
house
which
he
looted
and
distributed
the
spoils
among
the
poor
people
he
drove
off
thousands
of
cattle
from
the
terrazzas
range
and
ran
them
across
the
border
he
would
suddenly
descend
upon
a
prosperous
mine
and
seize
the
bullion
when
he
needed
corn
he
captured
a
granary
belonging
to
some
rich
man
he
recruited
almost
openly
in
the
villages
far
removed
from
the
roads
and
railways
organizing
the
outlaws
of
the
mountains
many
of
the
present
rebel
soldiers
used
to
belong
to
his
band
and
several
of
the
constitutionalist
generals
like
urbina
his
range
was
confined
mostly
to
southern
chihuahua
and
northern
durango
but
it
extended
from
coahuila
right
across
the
republic
to
the
state
of
sinaloa
his
reckless
and
romantic
bravery
is
the
subject
of
countless
poems
they
tell
for
example
how
one
of
his
band
named
reza
was
captured
by
the
and
bribed
to
betray
villa
villa
heard
of
it
and
sent
word
into
the
city
of
chihuahua
that
he
was
coming
for
reza
in
broad
daylight
he
entered
the
city
on
horseback
took
ice
cream
on
the
ballad
is
very
explicit
on
this
rode
up
and
down
the
streets
until
he
found
reza
strolling
with
his
sweetheart
in
the
sunday
crowd
on
the
paseo
bolivar
where
he
shot
him
and
escaped
in
time
of
famine
he
fed
whole
districts
and
took
care
of
entire
villages
evicted
by
the
soldiers
under
porfirio
diaz
s
outrageous
land
law
everywhere
he
was
known
as
the
friend
of
the
poor
he
was
the
mexican
robin
hood
in
all
these
years
he
learned
to
trust
nobody
often
in
his
secret
journeys
across
the
country
with
one
faithful
companion
he
camped
in
some
desolate
spot
and
dismissed
his
guide
then
leaving
a
fire
burning
he
rode
all
night
to
get
away
from
the
faithful
companion
that
is
how
villa
learned
the
art
of
war
and
in
the
field
when
the
army
comes
into
camp
at
night
villa
flings
the
bridle
of
his
horse
to
an
orderly
takes
a
serape
over
his
shoulder
and
sets
out
for
the
hills
alone
he
never
seems
to
sleep
in
the
dead
of
night
he
will
appear
somewhere
along
the
line
of
outposts
to
see
if
the
sentries
are
on
the
job
and
in
the
morning
he
returns
from
a
totally
different
direction
no
one
not
even
the
most
trusted
officer
of
his
staff
knows
the
least
of
his
plans
until
he
is
ready
for
action
when
madero
took
the
field
in
villa
was
still
an
outlaw
perhaps
as
his
enemies
say
he
saw
a
chance
to
whitewash
himself
perhaps
as
seems
probable
he
was
inspired
by
the
revolution
of
the
peons
anyway
about
three
months
after
they
rose
in
arms
villa
suddenly
appeared
in
el
paso
and
put
himself
his
band
his
knowledge
of
the
country
and
all
his
fortune
at
the
command
of
madero
the
vast
wealth
that
people
said
he
must
have
accumulated
during
his
twenty
years
of
robbery
turned
out
to
be
silver
badly
worn
villa
became
a
captain
in
the
maderista
army
and
as
such
went
to
mexico
city
with
madero
and
was
made
honorary
general
of
the
new
he
was
attached
to
huerta
s
army
when
it
was
sent
north
to
put
down
the
orozco
revolution
villa
commanded
the
garrison
of
parral
and
defeated
orozco
with
an
inferior
force
in
the
only
decisive
battle
of
the
war
huerta
put
villa
in
command
of
the
advance
and
let
him
and
the
veterans
of
madero
s
army
do
the
dangerous
and
dirty
work
while
the
old
line
federal
regiments
lay
back
under
the
protection
of
their
artillery
in
jimenez
huerta
suddenly
summoned
villa
before
a
and
charged
him
with
to
have
wired
an
order
to
villa
in
parral
which
order
villa
said
he
never
received
the
lasted
fifteen
minutes
and
huerta
s
most
powerful
future
antagonist
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
alfonso
madero
who
was
on
huerta
s
staff
stayed
the
execution
but
president
madero
forced
to
back
up
the
orders
of
his
commander
in
the
field
imprisoned
villa
in
the
penitentiary
of
the
capital
during
all
this
time
villa
never
wavered
in
his
loyalty
to
thing
in
mexican
history
for
a
long
time
he
had
passionately
wanted
an
education
now
he
wasted
no
time
in
regrets
or
political
intrigue
he
set
himself
with
all
his
force
to
learn
to
read
and
write
villa
hadn
t
the
slightest
foundation
to
work
upon
he
spoke
the
crude
spanish
of
the
very
is
called
he
knew
nothing
of
the
rudiments
or
philosophy
of
language
and
he
started
out
to
learn
those
first
because
he
always
must
know
the
why
of
things
in
nine
months
he
could
write
a
very
fair
hand
and
read
the
newspapers
it
is
interesting
now
to
see
him
read
or
rather
hear
him
for
he
has
to
drone
the
words
aloud
like
a
small
child
finally
the
madero
government
connived
at
his
escape
from
prison
either
to
save
huerta
s
face
because
villa
s
friends
had
demanded
an
investigation
or
because
madero
was
convinced
of
his
innocence
and
didn
t
dare
openly
to
release
him
from
that
time
to
the
outbreak
of
the
last
revolution
villa
lived
in
el
paso
texas
and
it
was
from
there
that
he
set
out
in
april
to
conquer
mexico
with
four
companions
three
led
horses
two
pounds
of
sugar
and
coffee
and
a
pound
of
salt
there
is
a
little
story
connected
with
that
he
hadn
t
money
enough
to
buy
horses
nor
had
any
of
his
companions
but
he
sent
two
of
them
to
a
local
livery
stable
to
rent
riding
horses
every
day
for
a
week
they
always
paid
carefully
at
the
end
of
the
ride
so
when
they
asked
for
eight
horses
the
livery
stable
man
had
no
hesitation
about
trusting
them
with
them
six
months
later
when
villa
came
triumphantly
into
juarez
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
four
thousand
men
the
first
public
act
he
committed
was
to
send
a
man
with
double
the
price
of
the
horses
to
the
owner
of
the
livery
stable
he
recruited
in
the
mountains
near
san
andres
and
so
great
was
his
popularity
that
within
one
month
he
had
raised
an
army
of
three
thousand
men
in
two
months
he
had
driven
the
federal
garrisons
all
over
the
state
of
chihuahua
back
into
chihuahua
city
in
six
months
he
had
taken
torreon
and
in
seven
and
a
half
juarez
had
fallen
to
him
mercado
s
federal
army
had
evacuated
chihuahua
and
northern
mexico
was
almost
free
peon
in
villa
proclaimed
himself
military
governor
of
the
state
of
chihuahua
and
began
the
extraordinary
because
he
knew
nothing
about
creating
a
government
for
people
out
of
his
head
it
has
often
been
said
that
villa
succeeded
because
he
had
educated
advisers
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
almost
alone
what
advisers
he
had
spent
most
of
their
time
answering
his
eager
questions
and
doing
what
he
told
them
i
used
sometimes
to
go
to
the
governor
s
palace
early
in
the
morning
and
wait
for
him
in
the
governor
s
chamber
about
eight
o
clock
sylvestre
terrazzas
the
secretary
of
state
sebastian
vargas
the
state
treasurer
and
manuel
chao
then
interventor
would
arrive
very
bustling
and
busy
with
huge
piles
of
reports
suggestions
and
decrees
which
they
had
drawn
up
villa
himself
came
in
about
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
made
them
read
out
loud
to
him
every
minute
he
would
interject
a
remark
correction
or
suggestion
occasionally
he
waved
his
finger
back
and
forward
and
said
when
they
were
all
through
he
began
rapidly
and
without
a
halt
to
outline
the
policy
of
the
state
of
chihuahua
legislative
financial
judicial
and
even
educational
when
he
came
to
a
place
that
bothered
him
he
said
how
do
they
do
that
and
then
after
it
was
carefully
explained
to
him
why
most
of
the
acts
and
usages
of
government
seemed
to
him
extraordinarily
unnecessary
and
snarled
up
for
example
his
advisers
proposed
to
finance
the
revolution
by
issuing
state
bonds
bearing
or
per
cent
interest
he
said
i
can
understand
why
the
state
should
pay
something
to
people
for
the
rent
of
their
money
but
how
is
it
just
to
pay
the
whole
sum
back
to
them
three
or
four
times
over
he
couldn
t
see
why
rich
men
should
be
granted
huge
tracts
of
land
and
poor
men
should
not
the
whole
complex
structure
of
civilization
was
new
to
him
you
had
to
be
a
philosopher
to
explain
anything
to
villa
and
his
advisers
were
only
practical
men
there
was
the
financial
question
it
came
to
villa
in
this
way
he
noticed
all
of
a
sudden
that
there
was
no
money
in
circulation
the
farmers
who
produced
meat
and
vegetables
refused
to
come
into
the
city
markets
any
more
because
no
one
had
any
money
to
buy
from
them
the
truth
was
that
those
possessing
silver
or
mexican
buried
them
in
the
ground
chihuahua
not
being
a
manufacturing
center
and
the
few
factories
there
having
closed
down
there
was
nothing
which
could
be
exchanged
for
food
so
like
a
blight
the
paralysis
of
the
production
of
food
began
all
at
once
and
actual
starvation
stared
at
the
town
populations
i
remember
hearing
vaguely
of
several
highly
elaborate
plans
for
the
relief
of
this
condition
put
forward
by
villa
s
advisers
he
himself
said
why
if
all
they
need
is
money
let
s
print
some
so
they
inked
up
the
printing
press
in
the
basement
of
the
governor
s
palace
and
ran
off
two
million
pesos
on
strong
paper
stamped
with
the
signatures
of
government
officials
and
with
villa
s
name
printed
across
the
middle
in
large
letters
the
counterfeit
money
which
afterward
flooded
el
paso
was
distinguished
from
the
original
by
the
fact
that
the
names
of
the
officials
were
signed
instead
of
stamped
this
first
issue
of
currency
was
guaranteed
by
absolutely
nothing
but
the
name
of
francisco
villa
it
was
issued
chiefly
to
revive
the
petty
internal
commerce
of
the
state
so
that
the
poor
people
could
get
food
and
yet
almost
immediately
it
was
bought
by
the
banks
of
el
paso
at
to
cents
on
the
dollar
because
villa
guaranteed
it
of
course
he
knew
nothing
of
the
accepted
ways
of
getting
his
money
into
circulation
he
began
to
pay
the
army
with
it
on
christmas
day
he
called
the
poor
people
of
chihuahua
together
and
gave
them
apiece
outright
then
he
issued
a
short
decree
ordering
the
acceptance
of
his
money
at
par
throughout
the
state
the
succeeding
saturday
the
of
chihuahua
and
the
other
nearby
towns
swarmed
with
farmers
and
with
buyers
villa
issued
another
proclamation
fixing
the
price
of
beef
at
seven
cents
a
pound
milk
at
five
cents
a
quart
and
bread
at
four
cents
a
loaf
there
was
no
famine
in
chihuahua
but
the
big
merchants
who
had
timidly
reopened
their
stores
for
the
first
time
since
his
entry
into
chihuahua
placarded
their
goods
with
two
sets
of
price
for
mexican
silver
money
and
and
the
other
for
villa
he
stopped
that
by
another
decree
ordering
sixty
days
imprisonment
for
anybody
who
discriminated
against
his
currency
but
still
the
silver
and
refused
to
come
out
of
the
ground
and
these
villa
needed
to
buy
arms
and
supplies
for
his
army
so
he
simply
proclaimed
to
the
people
that
after
the
tenth
of
february
mexican
silver
and
would
be
regarded
as
counterfeit
and
that
before
that
time
they
could
be
exchanged
for
his
own
money
at
par
in
the
state
treasury
but
the
large
sums
of
the
rich
still
eluded
him
most
of
the
financiers
declared
that
it
was
all
a
bluff
and
held
on
but
lo
on
the
morning
of
february
tenth
a
decree
was
pasted
up
on
the
walls
all
over
chihuahua
city
announcing
that
from
that
time
on
all
mexican
silver
and
were
counterfeit
and
could
not
be
exchanged
for
villa
money
in
the
treasury
and
anyone
attempting
to
pass
them
was
liable
to
sixty
days
in
the
penitentiary
a
great
howl
went
up
not
only
from
the
capitalists
but
from
the
shrewd
misers
of
distant
villages
about
two
weeks
after
the
issue
of
this
decree
i
was
taking
lunch
with
villa
in
the
house
which
he
had
confiscated
from
manuel
gomeros
and
used
as
his
official
residence
a
delegation
of
three
peons
in
sandals
arrived
from
a
village
in
the
tarahumare
to
protest
against
the
counterfeit
decree
but
said
the
spokesman
we
did
not
hear
of
the
decree
until
we
have
been
using
and
silver
in
our
village
we
had
not
seen
your
money
and
we
did
not
know
you
have
a
good
deal
of
money
interrupted
villa
suddenly
yes
three
or
four
or
five
thousand
perhaps
more
than
that
señores
villa
squinted
at
them
ferociously
samples
of
my
money
reached
your
village
within
hours
after
it
was
issued
you
decided
that
my
government
would
not
last
you
dug
holes
under
your
fireplaces
and
put
the
silver
and
there
you
knew
of
my
first
proclamation
a
day
after
it
was
posted
up
in
the
streets
of
chihuahua
and
you
ignored
it
the
counterfeit
decree
you
also
knew
as
soon
as
it
was
issued
you
thought
there
was
always
time
to
change
if
it
became
necessary
and
then
you
got
frightened
and

word
of
mouth
and
wednesday
at
high
noon
one
could
not
pass
the
treasury
door
for
the
eager
mob
gathered
there
villa
s
great
passion
was
schools
he
believed
that
land
for
the
people
and
schools
would
settle
every
question
of
civilization
schools
were
an
obsession
with
him
often
i
have
heard
him
say
when
i
passed
such
and
such
a
street
this
morning
i
saw
a
lot
of
kids
let
s
put
a
school
there
chihuahua
has
a
population
of
under
people
at
different
times
villa
established
over
fifty
schools
there
the
great
dream
of
his
life
has
been
to
send
his
son
to
school
in
the
united
states
but
at
the
opening
of
the
term
in
february
he
had
to
abandon
it
because
he
didn
t
have
money
enough
to
pay
for
a
half
year
s
tuition
no
sooner
had
he
taken
over
the
government
of
chihuahua
than
he
put
his
army
to
work
running
the
electric
light
plant
the
street
railways
the
telephone
the
water
works
and
the
terrazzas
flour
mill
he
delegated
soldiers
to
administer
the
great
haciendas
which
he
had
confiscated
he
manned
the
with
soldiers
and
sold
terrazzas
s
beef
to
the
people
for
the
government
a
thousand
of
them
he
put
in
the
streets
of
the
city
as
civil
police
prohibiting
on
pain
of
death
stealing
or
the
sale
of
liquor
to
the
army
a
soldier
who
got
drunk
was
shot
he
even
tried
to
run
the
brewery
with
soldiers
but
failed
because
he
couldn
t
find
an
expert
maltster
the
only
thing
to
do
with
soldiers
in
time
of
peace
said
villa
is
to
put
them
to
work
an
idle
soldier
is
always
thinking
of
war
in
the
matter
of
the
political
enemies
of
the
revolution
he
was
just
as
simple
just
as
effective
two
hours
after
he
entered
the
governor
s
palace
the
foreign
consuls
came
in
a
body
to
ask
his
protection
for
federal
soldiers
who
had
been
left
as
a
police
force
at
the
request
of
the
foreigners
before
answering
them
villa
said
suddenly
which
is
the
spanish
consul
scobell
the
british
said
i
represent
the
spaniards
all
right
snapped
villa
tell
them
to
begin
to
pack
any
spaniard
caught
within
the
boundaries
of
this
state
after
five
days
will
be
escorted
to
the
nearest
wall
by
a
firing
squad
the
consuls
gave
a
gasp
of
horror
scobell
began
a
violent
protest
but
villa
cut
him
short
this
is
not
a
sudden
determination
on
my
part
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
about
this
since
the
spaniards
must
go
letcher
the
american
consul
said
general
i
don
t
question
your
motives
but
i
think
you
are
making
a
grave
political
mistake
in
expelling
the
spaniards
the
government
at
washington
will
hesitate
a
long
time
before
becoming
friendly
to
a
party
which
makes
use
of
such
barbarous
measures
señor
consul
answered
villa
we
mexicans
have
had
three
hundred
years
of
the
spaniards
they
have
not
changed
in
character
since
the
they
disrupted
the
indian
empire
and
enslaved
the
people
we
did
not
ask
them
to
mingle
their
blood
with
ours
twice
we
drove
them
out
of
mexico
and
allowed
them
to
return
with
the
same
rights
as
mexicans
and
they
used
these
rights
to
steal
away
our
land
to
make
the
people
slaves
and
to
take
up
arms
against
the
cause
of
liberty
they
supported
porfirio
diaz
they
were
perniciously
active
in
politics
it
was
the
spaniards
who
framed
the
plot
that
put
huerta
in
the
palace
when
madero
was
murdered
the
spaniards
in
every
state
in
the
republic
held
banquets
of
rejoicing
they
thrust
on
us
the
greatest
superstition
the
world
has
ever
catholic
church
they
ought
to
be
killed
for
that
alone
i
consider
we
are
being
very
generous
with
them
scobell
insisted
vehemently
that
five
days
was
too
short
a
time
that
he
couldn
t
possibly
reach
all
the
spaniards
in
the
state
by
that
time
so
villa
extended
the
time
to
ten
days
the
rich
mexicans
who
had
oppressed
the
people
and
opposed
the
revolution
he
expelled
promptly
from
the
state
and
confiscated
their
vast
holdings
by
a
simple
stroke
of
the
pen
the
acres
and
innumerable
business
enterprises
of
the
terrazzas
family
became
the
property
of
the
constitutionalist
government
as
well
as
the
great
lands
of
the
creel
family
and
the
magnificent
palaces
which
were
their
town
houses
remembering
however
how
the
terrazzas
exiles
had
once
financed
the
orozco
revolution
he
imprisoned
don
luis
terrazzas
as
a
hostage
in
his
own
house
in
chihuahua
some
particularly
obnoxious
political
enemies
were
promptly
executed
in
the
penitentiary
the
revolution
possesses
a
black
book
in
which
are
set
down
the
names
offenses
and
property
of
those
who
have
oppressed
and
robbed
the
people
the
germans
who
had
been
particularly
active
politically
the
englishmen
and
americans
he
does
not
yet
dare
to
molest
their
pages
in
the
black
book
will
be
opened
when
the
constitutionalist
government
is
established
in
mexico
city
and
there
too
he
will
settle
the
account
of
the
mexican
people
with
the
catholic
church
villa
knew
that
the
reserve
of
the
banco
minero
amounting
to
about
gold
was
hidden
somewhere
in
chihuahua
don
luis
terrazzas
was
a
director
of
that
bank
when
he
refused
to
divulge
the
of
the
money
villa
and
a
squad
of
soldiers
took
him
out
of
his
house
one
night
rode
him
on
a
mule
out
into
the
desert
and
strung
him
up
to
a
tree
by
the
neck
he
was
cut
down
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
and
led
villa
to
an
old
forge
in
the
terrazzas
iron
works
under
which
was
discovered
the
reserve
of
the
banco
minero
terrazzas
went
back
to
prison
badly
shaken
and
villa
sent
word
to
his
father
in
el
paso
that
he
would
release
the
son
upon
payment
of
ransom
human
villa
has
two
wives
one
a
patient
simple
woman
who
was
with
him
during
all
his
years
of
outlawry
who
lives
in
el
paso
and
the
other
a
slender
young
girl
who
is
the
mistress
of
his
house
in
chihuahua
he
is
perfectly
open
about
it
though
lately
the
educated
conventional
mexicans
who
have
been
gathering
about
him
in
numbers
have
tried
to
hush
up
the
fact
among
the
peons
it
is
not
only
not
unusual
but
customary
to
have
more
than
one
mate
one
hears
a
great
many
stories
of
villa
s
violating
women
i
asked
him
if
that
were
true
he
pulled
his
mustache
and
stared
at
me
for
a
minute
with
an
inscrutable
expression
i
never
take
the
trouble
to
deny
such
stories
he
said
they
say
i
am
a
bandit
too
well
you
know
my
history
but
tell
me
have
you
ever
met
a
husband
father
or
brother
of
any
woman
that
i
have
violated
he
paused
or
even
a
witness
it
is
fascinating
to
watch
him
discover
new
ideas
remember
that
he
is
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
troubles
and
confusions
and
readjustments
of
modern
civilization
socialism
he
said
once
when
i
wanted
to
know
what
he
thought
of
it
it
a
thing
i
only
see
it
in
books
and
i
do
not
read
much
once
i
asked
him
if
women
would
vote
in
the
new
republic
he
was
sprawled
out
on
his
bed
with
his
coat
unbuttoned
why
i
don
t
think
so
he
said
startled
suddenly
sitting
up
what
do
you
do
you
mean
elect
a
government
and
make
laws
i
said
i
did
and
that
women
already
were
doing
it
in
the
united
states
well
he
said
scratching
his
head
if
they
do
it
up
there
i
don
t
see
that
they
shouldn
t
do
it
down
here
the
idea
seemed
to
amuse
him
enormously
he
rolled
it
over
and
over
in
his
mind
looking
at
me
and
away
again
it
may
be
as
you
say
he
said
but
i
have
never
thought
about
it
women
seem
to
me
to
be
things
to
protect
to
love
they
have
no
sternness
of
mind
they
can
t
consider
anything
for
its
right
or
wrong
they
are
full
of
pity
and
softness
why
he
said
a
woman
would
not
give
an
order
to
execute
a
traitor
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
i
said
women
can
be
crueller
and
harder
than
men
he
stared
at
me
pulling
his
mustache
and
then
he
began
to
grin
he
looked
slowly
to
where
his
wife
was
setting
the
table
for
lunch
he
said
come
here
listen
last
night
i
caught
three
traitors
crossing
the
river
to
blow
up
the
railroad
what
shall
i
do
with
them
shall
i
shoot
them
or
not
embarrassed
she
seized
his
hand
and
kissed
it
oh
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
she
said
you
know
best
no
said
villa
i
leave
it
entirely
to
you
those
men
were
going
to
try
to
cut
our
communications
between
juarez
and
chihuahua
they
were
what
shall
i
do
shall
i
shoot
them
or
not
oh
well
shoot
them
said
villa
villa
chuckled
delightedly
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
he
remarked
and
for
days
afterward
went
around
asking
the
cook
and
the
chambermaids
whom
they
would
like
to
have
for
president
of
mexico
he
never
missed
a
and
every
afternoon
at
four
o
clock
he
was
to
be
found
at
the
where
he
fought
his
own
birds
with
the
happy
enthusiasm
of
a
small
boy
in
the
evening
he
played
faro
in
some
gambling
hall
sometimes
in
the
late
morning
he
would
send
a
fast
courier
after
luis
leon
the
and
telephone
personally
to
the
asking
if
they
had
any
fierce
bulls
in
the
pen
they
almost
always
did
have
and
we
would
all
get
on
horseback
and
gallop
through
the
streets
about
a
mile
to
the
big
adobe
corrals
twenty
cowboys
cut
the
bull
out
of
the
herd
threw
and
tied
him
and
cut
off
his
sharp
horns
and
then
villa
and
luis
leon
and
anybody
else
who
wanted
to
would
take
the
professional
red
capes
and
go
down
into
the
ring
luis
leon
with
professional
caution
villa
as
stubborn
and
clumsy
as
the
bull
slow
on
his
feet
but
swift
as
an
animal
with
his
body
and
arms
villa
would
walk
right
up
to
the
pawing
infuriated
animal
and
with
his
double
cape
slap
him
insolently
across
the
face
and
for
half
an
hour
would
follow
the
greatest
sport
i
ever
saw
sometimes
the
horns
of
the
bull
would
catch
villa
in
the
seat
of
the
trousers
and
propel
him
violently
across
the
ring
then
he
would
turn
and
grab
the
bull
by
the
head
and
wrestle
with
him
with
the
sweat
streaming
down
his
face
until
five
or
six
seized
the
bull
s
tail
and
hauled
him
plowing
and
bellowing
back
villa
never
drinks
nor
smokes
but
he
will
outdance
the
most
ardent
in
mexico
when
the
order
was
given
for
the
army
to
advance
upon
torreon
villa
stopped
off
at
camargo
to
be
best
man
at
the
wedding
of
one
of
his
old
he
danced
steadily
without
stopping
they
said
all
monday
night
all
tuesday
and
all
tuesday
night
arriving
at
the
front
on
wednesday
morning
with
eyes
and
an
air
of
extreme
lassitude
funeral
of
abram
the
fact
that
villa
hates
useless
pomp
and
ceremony
makes
it
more
impressive
when
he
does
appear
on
a
public
occasion
he
has
the
knack
of
absolutely
expressing
the
strong
feeling
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
in
february
exactly
one
year
after
abram
gonzales
was
murdered
by
the
federals
at
bachimba
cañon
villa
ordered
a
great
funeral
ceremony
to
be
held
in
the
city
of
chihuahua
two
trains
carrying
the
officers
of
the
army
the
consuls
and
representatives
of
the
foreign
colony
left
chihuahua
early
in
the
morning
to
take
up
the
body
of
the
dead
governor
from
its
under
a
rude
wooden
cross
in
the
desert
villa
ordered
major
fierro
his
superintendent
of
railroads
to
get
the
trains
fierro
got
drunk
and
forgot
and
when
villa
and
his
brilliant
staff
arrived
at
the
railway
station
the
next
morning
the
regular
passenger
train
to
juarez
was
just
leaving
and
there
was
no
other
equipment
on
hand
villa
himself
leaped
on
to
the
already
moving
engine
and
compelled
the
engineer
to
back
the
train
up
to
the
station
then
he
walked
through
the
train
ordering
the
passengers
out
and
switched
it
in
the
direction
of
bachimba
they
had
no
sooner
started
than
he
summoned
fierro
before
him
and
discharged
him
from
the
superintendency
of
the
railroads
appointing
calzado
in
his
place
and
ordered
the
latter
to
return
at
once
to
chihuahua
and
be
thoroughly
informed
about
the
railroads
by
the
time
he
returned
at
bachimba
villa
stood
silently
by
the
grave
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
for
gonzales
had
been
his
close
friend
ten
thousand
people
stood
in
the
heat
and
dust
at
chihuahua
railway
station
when
the
funeral
train
arrived
and
poured
weeping
through
the
narrow
streets
behind
the
army
at
the
head
of
which
walked
villa
beside
the
hearse
his
automobile
was
waiting
but
he
angrily
refused
to
ride
stumbling
stubbornly
along
in
the
dirt
of
the
streets
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
that
night
there
was
a
in
the
theater
of
the
heroes
an
immense
auditorium
packed
with
emotional
peons
and
their
women
the
ring
of
boxes
was
brilliant
with
officers
in
their
full
dress
and
wedged
behind
them
up
the
five
high
balconies
were
the
ragged
poor
now
the
is
an
entirely
mexican
institution
first
there
comes
a
speech
then
a
recitation
on
the
piano
then
a
speech
followed
by
a
patriotic
song
rendered
by
a
chorus
of
awkward
little
indian
girls
from
the
public
school
with
squeaky
voices
another
speech
and
a
soprano
solo
from
trovatore
by
the
wife
of
some
government
official
still
another
speech
and
so
on
for
at
least
five
hours
whenever
there
is
a
prominent
funeral
or
a
national
holiday
or
a
president
s
anniversary
or
in
fact
an
occasion
of
the
least
importance
a
must
be
held
it
is
the
conventional
and
respectable
way
of
celebrating
anything
villa
sat
in
the
left
hand
stage
box
and
controlled
the
proceedings
by
tapping
a
little
bell
the
stage
itself
was
brilliantly
hideous
with
black
bunting
huge
masses
of
artificial
flowers
abominable
crayon
portraits
of
madero
piño
suarez
and
the
dead
governor
and
red
white
and
green
electric
lights
at
the
foot
of
all
this
was
a
very
small
plain
black
wooden
box
which
held
the
body
of
abram
gonzales
the
proceeded
in
an
orderly
and
exhausting
manner
for
about
two
hours
local
orators
trembling
with
stage
fright
mouthed
the
customary
castilian
extravagant
phrases
and
little
girls
stepped
on
their
own
feet
and
murdered
tosti
s
villa
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
that
wooden
box
never
moved
nor
spoke
at
the
proper
time
he
mechanically
tapped
the
little
bell
but
after
a
while
he
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
a
large
fleshy
mexican
was
in
the
middle
of
handel
s
largo
on
the
grand
piano
when
villa
stood
erect
he
put
his
foot
on
the
railing
of
the
box
and
leaped
to
the
stage
knelt
and
took
up
the
coffin
in
his
arms
handel
s
largo
petered
out
silent
astonishment
paralyzed
the
audience
holding
the
black
box
tenderly
in
his
arms
as
a
mother
with
her
baby
not
looking
at
anyone
villa
started
down
the
steps
of
the
stage
and
up
the
aisle
instinctively
the
house
rose
and
as
he
passed
out
through
the
swinging
doors
they
followed
on
silently
behind
him
he
strode
down
between
the
lines
of
waiting
soldiers
his
sword
banging
on
the
floor
across
the
dark
square
to
the
governor
s
palace
and
with
his
own
hands
put
the
coffin
on
the
table
waiting
for
it
in
the
audience
hall
it
had
been
arranged
that
four
generals
in
turn
should
stand
the
death
watch
each
for
two
hours
candles
shed
a
dim
light
over
the
table
and
the
surrounding
floor
but
the
rest
of
the
room
was
in
darkness
a
dense
mass
of
silent
breathing
people
packed
the
doorway
villa
unbuckled
his
sword
and
threw
it
clattering
into
a
corner
then
he
took
his
rifle
from
the
table
and
stood
the
first
watch
and
it
seems
incredible
to
those
who
don
t
know
him
that
this
remarkable
figure
who
has
risen
from
obscurity
to
the
most
prominent
position
in
mexico
in
three
years
should
not
covet
the
presidency
of
the
republic
but
that
is
in
entire
accordance
with
the
simplicity
of
his
character
when
asked
about
it
he
answered
as
always
with
perfect
directness
just
in
the
way
that
you
put
it
to
him
he
didn
t
quibble
over
whether
he
could
or
could
not
be
president
of
mexico
he
said
i
am
a
fighter
not
a
statesman
i
am
not
educated
enough
to
be
president
i
only
learned
to
read
and
write
two
years
ago
how
could
i
who
never
went
to
school
hope
to
be
able
to
talk
with
the
foreign
ambassadors
and
the
cultivated
gentlemen
of
the
congress
it
would
be
bad
for
mexico
if
an
uneducated
man
were
to
be
president
there
is
one
thing
that
i
will
not
do
that
is
to
take
a
position
for
which
i
am
not
fitted
there
is
only
one
order
of
my
jefe
carranza
which
i
would
refuse
to
obey
he
would
command
me
to
be
a
president
or
a
governor
on
behalf
of
my
paper
i
had
to
ask
him
this
question
five
or
six
times
finally
he
became
exasperated
i
have
told
you
many
times
he
said
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
my
becoming
president
of
mexico
are
the
newspapers
trying
to
make
trouble
between
me
and
my
jefe
this
is
the
last
time
that
i
will
answer
that
question
the
next
correspondent
that
asks
me
i
will
have
him
spanked
and
sent
to
the
border
for
days
afterward
he
went
around
grumbling
humorously
about
the
who
kept
asking
him
whether
he
wanted
to
be
president
of
mexico
the
idea
seemed
to
amuse
him
whenever
i
went
to
see
him
after
that
he
used
to
say
at
the
end
of
our
talk
well
aren
t
you
going
to
ask
me
whether
i
want
to
be
president
he
never
referred
to
carranza
except
as
my
jefe
and
he
obeyed
implicitly
the
slightest
order
from
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
his
loyalty
to
carranza
was
perfectly
obstinate
he
seemed
to
think
that
in
carranza
were
embodied
the
entire
ideals
of
the
revolution
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
many
of
his
advisers
tried
to
make
him
see
that
carranza
was
essentially
an
aristocrat
and
a
reformer
and
that
the
people
were
fighting
for
more
than
reform
carranza
s
political
program
as
set
forth
in
the
plan
of
guadelupe
carefully
avoids
any
promise
of
settlement
of
the
land
question
except
a
vague
endorsement
of
madero
s
plan
of
san
luis
potosi
and
it
is
evident
that
he
does
not
intend
to
advocate
any
radical
restoration
of
the
land
to
the
people
until
he
becomes
provisional
then
to
proceed
very
cautiously
in
the
meantime
he
seems
to
have
left
it
to
villa
s
judgment
as
well
as
all
other
details
of
the
conduct
of
the
revolution
in
the
north
but
villa
being
a
peon
and
feeling
with
them
rather
than
consciously
reasoning
it
out
that
the
land
question
is
the
real
cause
of
the
revolution
acted
with
characteristic
promptness
and
directness
no
sooner
had
he
settled
the
details
of
government
of
chihuahua
state
and
appointed
chao
his
provisional
governor
than
he
issued
a
proclamation
giving
and
acres
out
of
the
confiscated
lands
to
every
male
citizen
of
the
state
and
declaring
these
lands
inalienable
for
any
cause
for
a
period
of
ten
years
in
the
state
of
durango
the
same
thing
has
happened
and
as
other
states
are
free
of
federal
garrisons
he
will
pursue
the
same
policy
rules
of
on
the
field
too
villa
had
to
invent
an
entirely
original
method
of
warfare
because
he
never
had
a
chance
to
learn
anything
of
accepted
military
strategy
in
that
he
is
without
the
possibility
of
any
doubt
the
greatest
leader
mexico
has
ever
had
his
method
of
fighting
is
astonishingly
like
napoleon
s
secrecy
quickness
of
movement
the
adaptation
of
his
plans
to
the
character
of
the
country
and
of
his
soldiers
value
of
intimate
relations
with
the
rank
and
file
and
of
building
up
a
tradition
among
the
enemy
that
his
army
is
invincible
and
that
he
himself
bears
a
charmed
life
are
his
characteristics
he
knew
nothing
of
accepted
european
standards
of
strategy
or
of
discipline
one
of
the
troubles
of
the
mexican
federal
army
is
that
its
officers
are
thoroughly
saturated
with
conventional
military
theory
the
mexican
soldier
is
still
mentally
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
is
above
all
a
loose
individual
guerrilla
fighter
simply
paralyzes
the
machine
when
villa
s
army
goes
into
battle
he
is
not
hampered
by
salutes
or
rigid
respect
for
officers
or
trigonometrical
calculations
of
the
trajectories
of
projectiles
or
theories
of
the
percentage
of
hits
in
a
thousand
rounds
of
rifle
fire
or
the
function
of
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
in
any
particular
position
or
rigid
obedience
to
the
secret
knowledge
of
its
superiors
it
reminds
one
of
the
ragged
republican
army
that
napoleon
led
into
italy
it
is
probable
that
villa
doesn
t
know
much
about
those
things
himself
but
he
does
know
that
guerrilla
fighters
can
not
be
driven
blindly
in
platoons
around
the
field
in
perfect
step
that
men
fighting
individually
and
of
their
own
free
will
are
braver
than
long
volleying
rows
in
the
trenches
lashed
to
it
by
officers
with
the
flat
of
their
swords
and
where
the
fighting
is
a
ragged
mob
of
fierce
brown
men
with
hand
bombs
and
rifles
rush
the
streets
of
an
ambushed
is
among
them
like
any
common
soldier
up
to
his
day
mexican
armies
had
always
carried
with
them
hundreds
of
the
women
and
children
of
the
soldiers
villa
was
the
first
man
to
think
of
swift
forced
marches
of
bodies
of
cavalry
leaving
their
women
behind
up
to
his
time
no
mexican
army
had
ever
abandoned
its
base
it
had
always
stuck
closely
to
the
railroad
and
the
supply
trains
but
villa
struck
terror
into
the
enemy
by
abandoning
his
trains
and
throwing
his
entire
effective
army
upon
the
field
as
he
did
at
gomez
palacio
he
invented
in
mexico
that
most
demoralizing
form
of
night
attack
when
after
the
fall
of
torreon
last
september
he
withdrew
his
entire
army
in
the
face
of
orozco
s
advance
from
mexico
city
and
for
five
days
unsuccessfully
attacked
chihuahua
it
was
a
terrible
shock
to
the
federal
general
when
he
waked
up
one
morning
and
found
that
villa
had
sneaked
around
the
city
under
cover
of
darkness
captured
a
freight
train
at
terrazzas
and
descended
with
his
entire
army
upon
the
comparatively
undefended
city
of
juarez
it
wasn
t
fair
villa
found
that
he
hadn
t
enough
trains
to
carry
all
his
soldiers
even
when
he
had
ambushed
and
captured
a
federal
troop
train
sent
south
by
general
castro
the
federal
commander
in
juarez
so
he
telegraphed
that
gentleman
as
follows
signing
the
name
of
the
colonel
in
command
of
the
troop
train
engine
broken
down
at
moctezuma
send
another
engine
and
five
cars
the
unsuspecting
castro
immediately
dispatched
a
new
train
villa
then
telegraphed
him
wires
cut
between
here
and
chihuahua
large
force
of
rebels
approaching
from
south
what
shall
i
do
castro
replied
return
at
once
and
villa
obeyed
telegraphing
cheering
messages
at
every
station
along
the
way
the
federal
commander
got
wind
of
his
coming
about
an
hour
before
he
arrived
and
left
without
informing
his
garrison
so
that
outside
of
a
small
massacre
villa
took
juarez
almost
without
a
shot
and
with
the
border
so
near
he
managed
to
smuggle
across
enough
ammunition
to
equip
his
almost
armless
forces
and
a
week
later
sallied
out
and
routed
the
pursuing
federal
forces
with
great
slaughter
at
tierra
blanca
general
hugh
scott
in
command
of
the
american
troops
at
fort
bliss
sent
villa
a
little
pamphlet
containing
the
rules
of
war
adopted
by
the
hague
conference
he
spent
hours
poring
over
it
it
interested
and
amused
him
hugely
he
said
what
is
this
hague
conference
was
there
a
representative
of
mexico
there
was
there
a
representative
of
the
constitutionalists
there
it
seems
to
me
a
funny
thing
to
make
rules
about
war
it
s
not
a
game
what
is
the
difference
between
civilized
war
and
any
other
kind
of
war
if
you
and
i
are
having
a
fight
in
a
cantina
we
are
not
going
to
pull
a
little
book
out
of
our
pockets
and
read
over
the
rules
it
says
here
that
you
must
not
use
lead
bullets
but
i
don
t
see
why
not
they
do
the
work
for
a
long
time
afterward
he
went
around
popping
questions
at
his
officers
like
this
if
an
invading
army
takes
a
city
of
the
enemy
what
must
you
do
with
the
women
and
children
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
rules
of
war
didn
t
make
any
difference
in
villa
s
original
method
of
fighting
the
he
executed
wherever
he
captured
them
because
he
said
they
were
peons
like
the
revolutionists
and
that
no
peon
would
volunteer
against
the
cause
of
liberty
unless
he
were
bad
the
federal
officers
also
he
killed
because
he
explained
they
were
educated
men
and
ought
to
know
better
but
the
federal
common
soldiers
he
set
at
liberty
because
most
of
them
were
conscripts
and
thought
that
they
were
fighting
for
the
patria
there
is
no
case
on
record
where
he
wantonly
killed
a
man
anyone
who
did
so
he
promptly
fierro
fierro
the
man
who
killed
benton
was
known
as
the
butcher
throughout
the
army
he
was
a
great
handsome
animal
the
best
and
cruellest
rider
and
fighter
perhaps
in
all
the
revolutionary
forces
in
his
furious
lust
for
blood
fierro
used
to
shoot
down
a
hundred
prisoners
with
his
own
revolver
only
stopping
long
enough
to
reload
he
killed
for
the
pure
joy
of
it
during
two
weeks
that
i
was
in
chihuahua
fierro
killed
fifteen
inoffensive
citizens
in
cold
blood
but
there
was
always
a
curious
relationship
between
him
and
villa
he
was
villa
s
best
friend
and
villa
loved
him
like
a
son
and
always
pardoned
him
but
villa
although
he
had
never
heard
of
the
rules
of
war
carried
with
his
army
the
only
field
hospital
of
any
effectiveness
that
any
mexican
army
has
ever
carried
it
consisted
of
forty
enameled
inside
fitted
with
operating
tables
and
all
the
latest
appliances
of
surgery
and
manned
by
more
than
sixty
doctors
and
nurses
every
day
during
the
battle
shuttle
trains
full
of
the
desperately
wounded
ran
from
the
front
to
the
base
hospitals
at
parral
jimenez
and
chihuahua
he
took
care
of
the
federal
wounded
just
as
carefully
as
of
his
own
men
ahead
of
his
own
supply
train
went
another
train
carrying
two
thousand
sacks
of
flour
and
also
coffee
corn
sugar
and
cigarettes
to
feed
the
entire
starving
population
of
the
country
around
durango
city
and
torreon
the
common
soldiers
adore
him
for
his
bravery
and
his
coarse
blunt
humor
often
i
have
seen
him
slouched
on
his
cot
in
the
little
red
caboose
in
which
he
always
traveled
cracking
jokes
familiarly
with
twenty
ragged
privates
sprawled
on
the
floor
chairs
and
tables
when
the
army
was
entraining
or
detraining
villa
personally
would
be
on
hand
in
a
dirty
old
suit
without
a
collar
kicking
mules
in
the
stomach
and
pushing
horses
in
and
out
of
the
getting
thirsty
all
of
a
sudden
he
would
grab
some
soldier
s
canteen
and
drain
it
in
spite
of
the
indignant
protests
of
its
owner
and
then
tell
him
to
go
over
to
the
river
and
say
that
pancho
villa
said
that
he
should
fill
it
there
dream
of
pancho
it
might
not
be
uninteresting
to
know
the
passionate
vision
which
animates
this
ignorant
fighter
not
educated
enough
to
be
president
of
mexico
he
told
it
to
me
once
in
these
words
when
the
new
republic
is
established
there
will
never
be
any
more
army
in
mexico
armies
are
the
greatest
support
of
tyranny
there
can
be
no
dictator
without
an
army
we
will
put
the
army
to
work
in
all
parts
of
the
republic
we
will
establish
military
colonies
composed
of
the
veterans
of
the
revolution
the
state
will
give
them
grants
of
agricultural
lands
and
establish
big
industrial
enterprises
to
give
them
work
three
days
a
week
they
will
work
and
work
hard
because
honest
work
is
more
important
than
fighting
and
only
honest
work
makes
good
citizens
and
the
other
three
days
they
will
receive
military
instruction
and
go
out
and
teach
all
the
people
how
to
fight
then
when
the
patria
is
invaded
we
will
just
have
to
telephone
from
the
palace
at
mexico
city
and
in
half
a
day
all
the
mexican
people
will
rise
from
their
fields
and
factories
fully
armed
equipped
and
organized
to
defend
their
children
and
their
homes
my
ambition
is
to
live
my
life
in
one
of
those
military
colonies
among
my
whom
i
love
who
have
suffered
so
long
and
so
deeply
with
me
i
think
i
would
like
the
government
to
establish
a
leather
factory
there
where
we
could
make
good
saddles
and
bridles
because
i
know
how
to
do
that
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
would
like
to
work
on
my
little
farm
raising
cattle
and
corn
it
would
be
fine
i
think
to
help
make
mexico
a
happy
place
and
points
luisa
s
i
went
south
from
chihuahua
on
a
troop
train
bound
for
the
advance
near
escalon
attached
to
the
five
freight
cars
filled
with
horses
and
carrying
soldiers
on
top
was
a
coach
in
which
i
was
allowed
to
ride
with
two
hundred
noisy
male
and
female
it
was
gruesomely
suggestive
car
windows
smashed
mirrors
lamps
and
plush
seats
torn
out
and
bullet
holes
after
the
manner
of
a
frieze
the
time
of
our
departure
was
not
fixed
and
no
one
knew
when
the
train
would
arrive
the
railroad
had
just
been
repaired
in
places
where
there
had
once
been
bridges
we
plunged
into
arroyos
and
snorted
up
the
farther
bank
on
a
rickety
track
that
bent
and
cracked
under
us
all
day
long
the
roadside
was
lined
with
immense
distorted
steel
rails
torn
up
with
a
chain
and
a
backing
engine
by
the
thorough
orozco
last
year
there
was
a
rumor
that
castillo
s
bandits
were
planning
to
blow
us
up
with
dynamite
sometime
during
the
afternoon
peons
with
big
straw
sombreros
and
beautifully
faded
indians
in
blue
working
clothes
and
cowhide
sandals
and
women
with
black
shawls
around
their
heads
and
squalling
babies
the
seats
aisles
and
platforms
singing
eating
spitting
chattering
occasionally
there
staggered
by
a
ragged
man
with
a
cap
labeled
conductor
in
tarnished
gold
letters
very
drunk
embracing
his
friends
and
severely
demanding
the
tickets
and
safe
conducts
of
strangers
i
introduced
myself
to
him
by
a
small
present
of
united
states
currency
he
said
señor
you
may
travel
freely
over
the
republic
henceforth
without
payment
juan
algomero
is
at
your
orders
an
officer
smartly
uniformed
with
a
sword
at
his
side
was
at
the
rear
of
the
car
he
was
bound
for
the
front
he
said
to
lay
down
his
life
for
his
country
his
only
baggage
consisted
of
four
wooden
full
of
meadowlarks
farther
to
the
rear
two
men
sat
across
the
aisle
from
each
other
each
with
a
white
sack
containing
something
that
moved
and
clucked
as
soon
as
the
train
started
these
bags
were
opened
to
disgorge
two
large
roosters
who
wandered
up
and
down
the
aisles
eating
crumbs
and
cigarette
butts
the
two
owners
immediately
raised
their
voices
señores
five
pesos
on
this
valiant
and
handsome
rooster
five
pesos
señores
the
males
at
once
deserted
their
seats
and
rushed
clamoring
toward
the
center
of
the
car
not
one
of
them
appeared
to
lack
the
necessary
five
dollars
in
ten
minutes
the
two
promoters
were
kneeling
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
throwing
their
birds
and
as
we
rattled
along
swaying
from
side
to
side
swooping
down
into
the
gullies
and
laboring
up
the
other
bank
a
whirling
mass
of
feathers
and
flashing
steel
rolled
up
and
down
the
aisle
that
over
a
youth
stood
up
and
played
whistling
rufus
on
a
tin
flute
someone
had
a
leather
bottle
of
of
which
we
all
took
a
swig
from
the
rear
of
the
car
came
shouts
of
a
come
on
and
dance
and
in
a
moment
five
couples
all
men
of
course
were
madly
a
blind
old
peasant
was
assisted
to
climb
upon
his
seat
where
he
quaveringly
recited
a
long
ballad
about
the
heroic
exploits
of
the
great
general
maclovio
herrera
everybody
was
silently
attentive
and
showered
pennies
into
the
old
man
s
sombrero
occasionally
there
floated
back
to
us
the
singing
of
the
soldiers
on
the
in
front
and
the
sound
of
their
shots
as
they
caught
sight
of
a
coyote
galloping
through
the
mesquite
then
everybody
in
our
car
would
make
a
rush
for
the
windows
pulling
at
their
revolvers
and
shoot
fast
and
furiously
all
the
long
afternoon
we
ambled
slowly
south
the
western
rays
of
the
sun
burning
as
they
struck
our
faces
every
hour
or
so
we
stopped
at
some
station
shot
to
pieces
by
one
army
or
the
other
during
the
three
years
of
revolution
there
the
train
would
be
besieged
by
vendors
of
cigarettes
bottles
of
milk
and
rolled
in
old
women
gossiping
descended
from
the
train
built
themselves
a
little
fire
and
boiled
coffee
squatting
there
smoking
their
cigarettes
they
told
one
another
interminable
love
stories
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
we
pulled
into
jimenez
i
shouldered
through
the
entire
population
come
down
to
meet
the
train
passed
between
the
flaring
torches
of
the
little
row
of
candy
booths
and
went
along
the
street
where
drunken
soldiers
alternated
with
painted
girls
walking
arm
in
arm
to
doña
luisa
s
station
hotel
it
was
locked
i
pounded
on
the
door
and
a
little
window
opened
at
the
side
showing
an
incredibly
ancient
woman
s
face
crowned
with
straggly
white
hair
this
being
squinted
at
me
through
a
pair
of
steel
spectacles
and
remarked
well
i
guess
you
re
all
right
then
there
came
a
sound
of
bars
being
taken
down
and
the
door
swung
open
doña
luisa
herself
a
great
bunch
of
keys
at
her
belt
stood
just
inside
she
held
a
large
chinaman
by
the
ear
addressing
him
in
fluent
and
profane
spanish
she
said
what
do
you
mean
by
telling
a
guest
at
this
hotel
that
there
wasn
t
any
more
hot
cakes
why
didn
t
you
make
some
more
now
take
your
dirty
little
bundle
and
get
out
of
here
with
a
final
wrench
she
released
the
squealing
oriental
these
damn
heathen
she
announced
in
english
the
nasty
beggars
i
don
t
take
any
lip
from
a
dirty
chinaman
who
can
live
on
a
nickel
s
worth
of
rice
a
day
then
she
nodded
apologetically
toward
the
door
there
s
so
many
damned
drunken
generals
around
that
i
ve
got
to
keep
the
door
locked
i
don
t
want
the
mexican
in
here
doña
luisa
is
a
small
dumpy
american
woman
more
than
eighty
years
of
benevolent
sort
of
person
for
years
she
has
been
in
mexico
and
thirty
or
more
years
ago
when
her
husband
died
she
began
to
keep
the
station
hotel
war
and
peace
make
no
difference
to
her
the
american
flag
flies
over
the
door
and
in
her
house
she
alone
is
boss
when
pascual
orozco
took
jimenez
his
men
began
a
drunken
reign
of
terror
in
the
town
orozco
the
invincible
the
fierce
who
would
as
soon
kill
a
person
as
drunk
to
the
station
hotel
with
two
of
his
officers
and
several
women
doña
luisa
planted
herself
across
the
shook
her
fist
in
his
face
pascual
orozco
she
cried
take
your
disreputable
friends
and
go
away
from
here
i
m
keeping
a
decent
hotel
and
orozco
went
a
la
i
wandered
up
the
incredibly
dilapidated
street
that
leads
to
the
town
a
streetcar
came
past
drawn
by
one
galloping
mule
and
bulging
with
slightly
intoxicated
soldiers
open
surreys
full
of
officers
with
girls
on
their
laps
rolled
along
under
the
dusty
bare
alamo
trees
each
window
held
its
señorita
with
a
in
attendance
there
were
no
lights
the
night
was
dry
and
cold
and
full
of
a
subtle
exotic
excitement
guitars
twanged
snatches
of
song
and
laughter
and
low
voices
and
shouts
from
distant
streets
filled
the
darkness
occasionally
little
companies
of
soldiers
on
foot
came
along
or
a
troop
of
horsemen
in
high
sombreros
and
serapes
jingled
silently
out
of
the
blackness
and
faded
away
again
bound
probably
for
the
relief
of
guard
in
one
quiet
stretch
of
street
near
the
where
there
are
no
houses
i
noticed
an
automobile
speeding
from
the
town
at
the
same
time
a
galloping
horse
came
from
the
other
direction
and
just
in
front
of
me
the
headlights
of
the
machine
illumined
the
horse
and
his
rider
a
young
officer
in
a
stetson
hat
the
automobile
jarred
to
a
grinding
stop
and
a
voice
from
it
cried
who
speaks
asked
the
horseman
pulling
his
mount
to
its
haunches
i
gusman
and
the
other
leaped
to
the
ground
and
came
into
the
light
a
coarse
fat
mexican
with
a
sword
at
his
belt
como
le
va
mi
capitan
the
officer
flung
himself
from
his
horse
they
embraced
patting
each
other
on
the
back
with
both
hands
very
well
and
you
where
are
you
going
to
see
maria
the
captain
laughed
don
t
do
it
he
said
i
m
going
to
see
maria
myself
and
if
i
see
you
there
i
shall
certainly
kill
you
but
i
am
going
just
the
same
i
am
as
quick
with
my
pistol
as
you
señor
but
you
see
returned
the
other
mildly
we
both
can
not
go
perfectly
said
the
captain
to
his
chauffeur
turn
your
car
so
as
to
throw
the
light
evenly
along
the
sidewalk
and
now
we
will
walk
thirty
paces
apart
and
stand
with
our
backs
turned
until
you
count
three
then
the
man
who
first
puts
a
bullet
through
the
other
man
s
hat
wins
both
men
drew
immense
revolvers
and
stood
a
moment
in
the
light
spinning
the
chambers
ready
cried
the
horseman
hurry
it
said
the
captain
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
balk
love
back
to
back
they
had
already
begun
to
pace
the
distance
one
shouted
the
chauffeur
two
but
quick
as
a
flash
the
fat
man
wheeled
in
the
trembling
uncertain
light
threw
down
his
lifted
arm
and
a
mighty
roar
went
soaring
slowly
into
the
heavy
night
the
stetson
of
the
other
man
whose
back
was
still
turned
took
an
odd
little
leap
ten
feet
beyond
him
he
spun
around
but
the
captain
was
already
climbing
into
his
machine
he
said
cheerfully
i
win
until
then
and
the
automobile
gathered
speed
and
disappeared
down
the
street
the
horseman
slowly
went
to
where
his
hat
lay
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
he
stood
a
moment
meditating
and
then
deliberately
mounted
his
horse
and
he
also
went
away
i
had
already
started
some
time
before
in
the
plaza
the
regimental
band
was
playing
el
pagare
the
song
which
started
orozco
s
revolution
it
was
a
parody
of
the
original
referring
to
madero
s
payment
of
his
family
s
war
claims
as
soon
as
he
became
president
that
spread
like
wildfire
over
the
republic
and
had
to
be
suppressed
with
police
and
soldiers
el
pagare
is
even
now
taboo
in
most
revolutionary
circles
and
i
have
heard
of
men
being
shot
for
singing
it
but
in
jimenez
at
this
time
the
utmost
license
prevailed
moreover
the
mexicans
unlike
the
french
have
absolutely
no
feeling
for
symbols
bitterly
antagonistic
sides
use
the
same
flag
in
the
plaza
of
almost
every
town
still
stand
eulogistic
statues
of
porfirio
diaz
even
at
officers
mess
in
the
field
i
have
drunk
from
glasses
stamped
with
the
likeness
of
the
old
dictator
while
federal
army
uniforms
are
plentiful
in
the
ranks
but
el
pagare
is
a
swinging
glorious
tune
and
under
the
hundreds
of
little
electric
light
globes
strung
on
the
plaza
a
double
procession
marched
gaily
round
and
round
on
the
outside
in
groups
of
four
went
the
men
mostly
soldiers
on
the
inside
in
the
opposite
direction
the
girls
walked
arm
in
arm
as
they
passed
they
threw
handfuls
of
confetti
at
one
another
they
never
talked
to
one
another
never
stopped
but
as
a
girl
caught
a
man
s
fancy
he
slipped
a
lover
s
note
into
her
hand
as
she
went
by
and
she
answered
with
a
smile
if
she
liked
him
thus
they
met
and
later
the
girl
would
manage
to
let
the
know
her
address
this
would
lead
to
long
talks
at
her
window
in
the
darkness
and
then
they
would
be
lovers
it
was
a
delicate
business
this
handing
of
notes
every
man
carried
a
gun
and
every
man
s
girl
was
his
jealously
guarded
property
it
was
a
killing
matter
to
hand
a
note
to
someone
else
s
girl
the
throng
moved
gaily
on
thrilling
to
the
music
beyond
the
plaza
gaped
the
ruins
of
marcos
russek
s
store
which
these
same
men
had
looted
less
than
two
weeks
before
and
at
one
side
the
ancient
pink
cathedral
towered
among
its
fountains
and
great
trees
with
the
iron
and
glass
illuminated
sign
santo
cristo
de
burgos
shining
above
the
door
there
at
the
side
of
the
plaza
i
came
upon
a
little
group
of
five
americans
huddled
upon
a
bench
they
were
ragged
beyond
belief
all
except
a
slender
youth
in
leggings
and
a
federal
officer
s
uniform
who
wore
a
crownless
mexican
hat
feet
protruded
from
their
shoes
none
had
more
than
the
remnants
of
socks
all
were
unshaven
one
mere
boy
wore
his
arm
in
a
sling
made
out
of
a
torn
blanket
they
made
room
for
me
gladly
stood
up
crowded
around
cried
how
good
it
was
to
see
another
american
among
all
these
damned
greasers
what
are
you
fellows
doing
here
i
asked
we
re
soldiers
of
fortune
said
the
boy
with
the
wounded
arm
interrupted
another
soldiers
ye
see
it
s
this
way
began
the
soldierly
looking
youth
we
ve
been
fighting
right
along
in
the
brigada
at
the
battle
of
ojinaga
and
everything
and
now
comes
an
order
from
villa
to
discharge
all
the
americans
in
the
ranks
and
ship
em
back
to
the
border

t
that
a
hell
of
a
note
last
night
they
gave
us
our
honorable
discharges
and
threw
us
out
of
the
cuartel
said
a
man
with
red
hair
and
we
ain
t
had
any
place
to
sleep
and
nothing
to
broke
in
a
little
boy
whom
they
called
the
major

t
try
and
panhandle
the
guy
rebuked
the
soldier
indignantly
ain
t
we
each
going
to
get
fifty
mex
in
the
morning
we
adjourned
for
a
short
time
to
a
nearby
restaurant
and
when
we
returned
i
asked
them
what
they
were
going
to
do
the
old
for
mine
breathed
a
black
irishman
who

spoken
before
i

i

honorable
discharges
from

army
announced
the
soldierly
youth
proudly
served
through
the
spanish
war
i
did
i
m
the
only
soldier
in
this
bunch
the
others
sneered
and
cursed
sullenly
guess
i
ll
reënlist
when
i
get
over
the
border
not
for
mine
said
the
man
i
m
wanted
for
two
murder
didn

do
it
swear
to
god
i
didn
was
a
but
a
poor

when

fake
charge
against

a
i
m
all
right
though
he
went
on
earnestly
i
m
a
man
only
i
can
t
get
no
job
the
major
raised
his
hard
little
face
and
cruel
eyes
i
got
out
of
a
reform
school
in
wisconsin
he
said
and
i
guess
there

some
cops
waiting
for
me
in
el
paso
i
always
wanted
to
kill
somebody
with
a
gun
and
i

and
i
ain
t
got
a
bellyful
yet
they
told
us
we
could
stay
if
we
signed
mex
citizenship
papers
i
guess
i
ll
sign
morning
the
hell
you
will
cried
the
others
that
s
a
rotten
thing
to
do
suppose
we
get
intervention
and
you
have
to
shoot
against
your
own
people
you
won
t
catch
me
signing
myself
away
to
be
a
greaser
that
s
easy
fixed
said
the
major
when
i
go
back
to
the
states
i
leave
my
name
here
i
m
going
to
stay
down
here
till
i
get
enough
of
a
stake
to
go
back
to
georgia
and
start
a
factory
the
other
boy
had
suddenly
burst
into
tears
i
got
my
arm
shot
through
in
ojinaga
he
sobbed
and
now
they
re
turning
me
loose
without
any
money
and
i
can

work
when
i
get
to
el
paso
the
cops

he
explained

i
advised

down
here
if
villa
wants
americans
out
of
the
ranks
being
a
mexican
citizen
won
t
help
you
if
intervention
comes
perhaps
you
re

agreed
the
major
thoughtfully
aw
quit
your
bawling
jack
i
guess
i
ll
beat
it
over
to
galveston
and
get
on
a
south
american
boat
they
say
there
s
a
revolution
started
in
peru
the
soldier
was
about
thirty
the
irishman
and
the
three
others
somewhere
between
sixteen
and
eighteen
what
did
you
fellows
come
down
here
for
i
asked
excitement
answered
the
soldier
and
the
irishman
grinning
the
three
boys
looked
at
me
with
eager
earnest
faces
drawn
with
hunger
and
hardship
loot
they
said
simultaneously
i
cast
an
eye
at
their
dilapidated
garments
at
the
throngs
of
tattered
volunteers
parading
around
the
plaza
who
hadn
t
been
paid
for
three
months
and
restrained
a
violent
impulse
to
shout
with
mirth
soon
i
left
them
hard
cold
misfits
in
a
passionate
country
despising
the
cause
for
which
they
were
fighting
sneering
at
the
gaiety
of
the
irrepressible
mexicans
and
as
i
went
away
i
said
by
the
way
what
company
did
you
fellows
belong
to
what
did
you
call
yourselves
the
youth
answered
the
foreign
legion
he
said
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
i
saw
few
soldiers
of
fortune
except
he
was
a
scientist
studying
the
action
of
high
explosives
in
would
not
have
been
tramps
in
their
own
country
it
was
late
night
when
i
finally
got
back
to
the
hotel
doña
luisa
went
ahead
to
see
to
my
room
and
i
stopped
a
moment
in
the
bar
two
or
three
soldiers
evidently
officers
were
drinking
pretty
far
gone
he
was
a
man
with
a
trace
of
black
mustache
his
eyes
couldn
t
seem
to
focus
but
when
he
saw
me
he
began
to
sing
a
pleasant
little
song
i
thought
it
diplomatic
to
leave
because
you
can
never
tell
what
a
mexican
will
do
when
he
s
drunk
his
temperament
is
much
too
complicated
doña
luisa
was
in
my
room
when
i
got
there
with
a
mysterious
finger
to
her
lips
she
shut
the
door
and
produced
from
beneath
her
skirt
a
last
year
s
copy
of
the
evening
in
an
incredible
state
of
dissolution
i
got
it
out
of
the
safe
for
you
she
said
the
damn
thing
s
worth
more
than
anything
in
the
house
i
ve
been
offered
fifteen
dollars
for
it
by
americans
going
out
to
the
mines
you
see
we
haven
t
had
any
american
magazines
in
a
year
now
by
a
after
that
what
could
i
do
but
read
the
precious
magazine
although
i
had
read
it
before
i
lit
the
lamp
undressed
and
got
into
bed
just
then
came
an
unsteady
step
on
the
gallery
outside
and
my
door
was
flung
violently
open
framed
in
it
stood
the
officer
who
had
been
drinking
in
the
bar
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
big
revolver
for
a
moment
he
stood
blinking
at
me
malevolently
then
stepped
inside
and
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
i
am
lieutenant
antonio
montoya
at
your
orders
he
said
i
heard
there
was
a
gringo
in
this
hotel
and
i
have
come
to
kill
you
sit
down
said
i
politely
i
saw
he
was
drunkenly
in
earnest
he
took
off
his
hat
bowed
politely
and
drew
up
a
chair
then
he
produced
another
revolver
from
beneath
his
coat
and
laid
them
both
on
the
table
they
were
loaded
would
you
like
a
cigarette
i
offered
him
the
package
he
took
one
waved
it
in
thanks
and
lit
it
at
the
lamp
then
he
picked
up
the
guns
and
pointed
them
both
at
me
his
fingers
tightened
slowly
on
the
triggers
but
relaxed
again
i
was
too
far
gone
to
do
anything
but
just
wait
my
only
difficulty
said
he
lowering
his
weapons
is
to
determine
which
revolver
i
shall
use
pardon
me
i
quavered
but
they
both
appear
a
little
obsolete
that
colt
is
certainly
an
model
and
as
for
the
smith
and
wesson
between
ourselves
it
is
only
a
toy
true
he
answered
looking
at
them
a
little
ruefully
if
i
had
only
thought
i
would
have
brought
my
new
automatic
my
apologies
señor
he
sighed
and
again
directed
the
barrels
at
my
chest
with
an
expression
of
calm
happiness
however
since
it
is
so
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
got
ready
to
jump
to
duck
to
scream
suddenly
his
eye
fell
upon
the
table
where
my
was
lying
what
is
that
he
asked
a
watch
eagerly
i
demonstrated
how
to
fasten
it
on
unconsciously
the
pistols
slowly
lowered
with
parted
lips
and
absorbed
attention
he
watched
it
delightedly
as
a
child
watches
the
operation
of
some
new
mechanical
toy
ah
he
breathed
esta
how
pretty
it
is
yours
said
i
unstrapping
it
and
offering
it
to
him
he
looked
at
the
watch
then
at
me
slowly
brightening
and
glowing
with
surprised
joy
into
his
outstretched
hand
i
placed
it
reverently
carefully
he
adjusted
the
thing
to
his
hairy
wrist
then
he
rose
beaming
down
upon
me
the
revolvers
fell
unnoticed
to
the
floor
lieutenant
antonio
montoya
threw
his
arms
around
me
ah
he
cried
emotionally
the
next
day
i
met
him
at
valiente
adiana
s
store
in
the
town
we
sat
amicably
in
the
back
room
drinking
native
while
lieutenant
montoya
my
best
friend
in
the
entire
constitutionalist
army
told
me
of
the
hardships
and
perils
of
the
campaign
for
three
weeks
now
maclovio
herrera
s
brigade
had
lain
at
jimenez
under
arms
waiting
the
emergency
call
for
the
advance
on
torreon
this
morning
said
antonio
the
constitutionalist
spies
intercepted
a
telegram
from
the
federal
commander
in
zacatecas
city
to
general
velasco
in
torreon
he
said
that
upon
mature
judgment
he
had
decided
that
zacatecas
was
an
easier
place
to
attack
than
to
defend
therefore
he
reported
that
his
plan
of
campaign
was
this
upon
the
approach
of
the
constitutionalist
forces
he
intended
to
evacuate
the
city
and
then
take
it
again
antonio
i
said
i
am
going
a
long
journey
across
the
desert
i
am
going
to
drive
to
magistral
i
need
a
i
will
pay
three
dollars
a
week
sta
bueno
cried
lieutenant
montoya
whatever
you
wish
so
that
i
can
go
with
my
but
you
are
on
active
service
said
i
how
can
you
leave
your
regiment
oh
that
s
all
right
answered
antonio
i
won
t
say
anything
about
it
to
my
colonel
they
don
t
need
me
why
they
ve
got
five
thousand
other
men
here
of
in
the
early
dawn
when
yet
the
low
gray
houses
and
the
dusty
trees
were
stiff
with
cold
we
laid
a
on
the
backs
of
our
two
mules
and
rattled
down
the
uneven
streets
of
jimenez
and
out
into
the
open
country
a
few
soldiers
wrapped
to
the
eyes
in
their
serapes
dozed
beside
their
lanterns
there
was
a
drunken
officer
sleeping
in
the
gutter
we
drove
an
ancient
buggy
whose
broken
pole
was
mended
with
wire
the
harness
was
made
of
bits
of
old
iron
rawhide
and
rope
antonio
and
i
sat
side
by
side
upon
the
seat
and
at
our
feet
dozed
a
dark
youth
named
primitivo
aguilar
primitivo
had
been
hired
to
open
and
shut
gates
to
tie
up
the
harness
when
it
broke
and
to
keep
watch
over
wagon
and
mules
at
night
because
bandits
were
reported
to
infest
the
roads
the
country
became
a
vast
fertile
plain
cut
up
by
irrigating
ditches
which
were
overshadowed
by
long
lines
of
great
alamo
trees
leafless
and
gray
as
ashes
like
a
furnace
door
the
sun
blazed
upon
us
and
the
barren
fields
reeked
a
thin
mist
a
cloud
of
white
dust
moved
with
us
and
around
us
by
the
church
of
the
hacienda
san
pedro
we
stopped
and
dickered
with
an
aged
peon
for
a
sack
of
corn
and
straw
for
the
mules
farther
along
was
an
exquisite
low
building
of
pink
plaster
set
back
from
the
road
in
a
grove
of
green
willows
that
said
antonio
oh
that
is
nothing
but
a
flour
mill
we
had
lunch
in
the
long
whitewashed
room
of
a
peon
s
house
at
another
great
hacienda
whose
name
i
forget
but
which
i
know
had
once
belonged
to
luis
terrazzas
and
was
now
the
confiscated
property
of
the
constitutionalist
government
and
that
night
we
made
camp
beside
an
irrigation
ditch
miles
from
any
house
in
the
middle
of
the
bandit
territory
after
a
dinner
of
meat
and
peppers
beans
and
black
coffee
antonio
and
i
gave
primitivo
his
instructions
he
was
to
keep
watch
beside
the
fire
with
antonio
s
revolver
and
if
he
heard
anything
was
to
wake
us
but
on
no
account
was
he
to
go
to
sleep
if
he
did
we
would
kill
him
primitivo
said
very
gravely
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
gripped
the
pistol
antonio
and
i
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
by
the
fire
i
must
have
gone
to
sleep
at
once
because
when
i
was
wakened
by
antonio
s
rising
my
watch
showed
only
half
an
hour
later
from
the
place
where
primitivo
had
been
placed
on
guard
came
a
series
of
hearty
snores
the
lieutenant
walked
over
to
him
primitivo
he
said
no
answer
primitivo
you
fool
our
sentinel
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
turned
over
with
noises
indicative
of
comfort
primitivo
shouted
antonio
violently
kicking
him
he
gave
absolutely
no
response
antonio
drew
back
and
launched
a
kick
at
his
back
that
lifted
him
several
feet
into
the
air
with
a
start
primitivo
woke
he
started
up
alertly
waving
the
revolver
vive
cried
primitivo
the
next
day
took
us
out
of
the
lowlands
we
entered
the
desert
winding
over
a
series
of
rolling
plains
sandy
and
covered
with
black
mesquite
and
here
and
there
an
occasional
cactus
now
we
began
to
see
beside
the
road
those
sinister
little
wooden
crosses
that
the
country
people
erect
on
the
spot
where
some
man
died
a
violent
death
around
the
horizon
barren
purple
mountains
hemmed
us
in
to
the
right
across
a
vast
dry
valley
a
white
and
green
and
gray
hacienda
stood
like
a
city
an
hour
later
we
passed
the
first
of
those
great
fortified
square
ranchos
that
one
comes
across
once
a
day
lost
in
the
folds
of
this
tremendous
country
night
gathered
straight
above
in
the
cloudless
zenith
while
all
the
skyline
still
was
luminous
with
clear
light
and
then
the
day
snuffed
out
and
stars
burst
out
in
the
dome
of
heaven
like
a
rocket
antonio
and
primitivo
in
that
queer
harsh
mexican
harmony
which
sounds
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
fiddle
with
frazzled
strings
sang
as
we
jogged
along
it
grew
cold
for
leagues
and
leagues
around
was
a
blasted
land
a
country
of
death
it
was
hours
since
we
had
passed
a
house
antonio
claimed
to
know
of
a
somewhere
vaguely
ahead
but
toward
midnight
which
was
black
and
without
moon
we
discovered
that
the
road
upon
which
we
were
traveling
suddenly
petered
out
in
a
dense
mesquite
thicket
somewhere
we
had
turned
off
the
it
was
late
and
the
mules
were
worn
out
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
a
dry
camp
for
so
far
as
we
knew
there
was
no
water
anywhere
near
now
we
had
unharnessed
the
mules
and
fed
them
and
were
lighting
our
fire
when
somewhere
in
the
dense
thicket
of
chaparral
stealthy
footsteps
sounded
they
moved
a
space
and
then
were
still
our
little
blaze
of
greasewood
crackled
fiercely
lighting
up
a
leaping
glowing
radius
of
about
ten
feet
beyond
that
all
was
black
primitivo
made
one
backward
leap
into
the
shelter
of
the
wagon
antonio
drew
his
revolver
and
we
froze
beside
the
fire
the
sound
came
again
who
lives
said
antonio
there
was
a
little
shuffling
noise
out
in
the
brush
and
then
a
voice
what
party
are
you
it
asked
hesitantly
maderistas
answered
antonio
pass
it
is
safe
for
queried
the
invisible
one
on
my
word
i
cried
come
out
that
we
may
see
you
at
that
very
moment
two
vague
shapes
materialized
on
the
edge
of
the
firelight
glow
almost
without
a
peons
we
saw
as
soon
as
they
came
close
wrapped
tightly
in
their
torn
blankets
one
was
an
old
wrinkled
bent
man
wearing
homemade
sandals
his
trousers
hanging
in
rags
upon
his
shrunken
legs
the
other
a
very
tall
barefooted
youth
with
a
face
so
pure
and
so
simple
as
to
almost
verge
upon
idiocy
friendly
warm
as
sunlight
eagerly
curious
as
children
they
came
forward
holding
out
their
hands
we
shook
hands
with
each
of
them
in
turn
greeting
them
with
elaborate
mexican
courtesy
good
evening
friend
how
are
you
very
well
and
you
well
and
how
are
all
your
people
well
thanks
and
yours
well
thanks
what
have
you
of
new
here
nada
nothing
and
you
nothing
sit
down
oh
thanks
but
i
am
well
standing
sit
down
sit
down
a
thousand
thanks
excuse
us
for
a
moment
they
smiled
and
faded
away
once
more
into
the
thicket
in
a
minute
they
reappeared
with
great
armfuls
of
dried
mesquite
branches
for
our
fire
we
are
said
the
elder
bowing
we
keep
a
few
goats
and
our
houses
are
at
your
orders
and
our
corrals
for
your
mules
and
our
small
stock
of
corn
our
are
very
near
here
in
the
mesquite
we
are
very
poor
men
but
we
hope
you
will
do
us
the
honor
of
accepting
our
hospitality
it
was
an
occasion
for
tact
a
thousand
times
many
thanks
said
antonio
politely
but
we
are
unfortunately
in
great
haste
and
must
leave
early
we
would
not
like
to
disturb
your
household
at
that
hour
they
protested
that
their
families
and
their
houses
were
entirely
ours
to
be
used
as
we
saw
fit
with
the
greatest
delight
on
their
part
i
do
not
remember
how
we
finally
managed
to
evade
the
invitation
without
wounding
them
but
i
do
recall
that
it
took
half
an
hour
of
courteous
talking
for
we
knew
in
the
first
place
that
we
would
be
unable
to
leave
for
hours
in
the
morning
if
we
accepted
because
mexican
manners
are
that
haste
to
leave
a
house
signifies
dissatisfaction
with
the
entertainment
and
then
too
one
could
not
pay
for
one
s
lodging
but
would
have
to
bestow
a
handsome
present
upon
the
we
could
none
of
us
afford
at
first
they
politely
refused
our
invitation
to
dine
but
after
much
urging
we
finally
persuaded
them
to
accept
a
few
and
it
was
ludicrous
and
pitiful
to
see
how
wretchedly
hungry
they
were
and
how
they
attempted
to
conceal
it
from
us
after
dinner
when
they
had
brought
us
a
bucket
of
water
out
of
sheer
kindly
thoughtfulness
they
stood
for
a
while
by
our
fire
smoking
our
cigarettes
and
holding
out
their
hands
to
the
blaze
i
remember
how
their
serapes
hung
from
their
shoulders
open
in
front
so
the
grateful
warmth
could
reach
their
thin
how
gnarled
and
ancient
were
the
old
man
s
outstretched
hands
and
how
the
ruddy
light
glowed
upon
the
other
s
throat
and
kindled
fires
in
his
big
eyes
around
them
stretched
the
desert
held
off
only
by
our
fire
ready
to
spring
in
upon
us
when
it
should
die
above
the
great
stars
would
not
dim
coyotes
wailed
somewhere
out
beyond
the
firelight
like
demons
in
pain
i
suddenly
conceived
these
two
human
beings
as
symbols
of
loving
patient
poor
so
long
slaves
so
full
of
dreams
so
soon
to
be
free
when
we
saw
your
wagon
coming
here
said
the
old
man
smiling
our
hearts
sank
within
us
we
thought
you
were
soldiers
come
perhaps
to
take
away
our
last
few
goats
so
many
soldiers
have
come
in
the
last
few
many
it
is
mostly
the
maderistas
do
not
come
unless
they
are
hungry
themselves
poor
maderistas
ay
said
the
young
man
my
brother
that
i
loved
very
much
died
in
the
eleven
days
fighting
around
torreon
thousands
have
died
in
mexico
and
still
more
thousands
shall
fall
three
is
long
for
war
in
a
land
too
long
the
old
man
murmured
dios
and
shook
his
head
but
there
shall
come
a
it
is
said
remarked
the
old
man
quaveringly
that
the
united
states
of
the
north
covets
our
gringo
soldiers
will
come
and
take
away
my
goats
in
the
end
that
is
a
lie
exclaimed
the
other
animated
it
is
the
rich
americanos
who
want
to
rob
us
just
as
the
rich
mexicans
want
to
rob
us
it
is
the
rich
all
over
the
world
who
want
to
rob
the
poor
the
old
man
shivered
and
drew
his
wasted
body
nearer
to
the
fire
i
have
often
wondered
said
he
mildly
why
the
rich
having
so
much
want
so
much
the
poor
who
have
nothing
want
so
very
little
just
a
few
goats
his
lifted
his
chin
like
a
noble
smiling
gently
i
have
never
been
out
of
this
little
country
even
to
jimenez
he
said
but
they
tell
me
that
there
are
many
rich
lands
to
the
north
and
south
and
east
but
this
is
my
land
and
i
love
it
for
the
years
of
me
and
my
father
and
my
grandfather
the
rich
men
have
gathered
the
corn
and
held
it
in
their
clenched
fists
before
our
mouths
and
only
blood
will
make
them
open
their
hands
to
their
brothers
the
fire
died
down
at
his
post
slept
the
alert
primitivo
antonio
stared
into
the
embers
a
faint
glorified
smile
upon
his
mouth
his
eyes
shining
like
stars
he
said
suddenly
as
one
who
sees
a
vision
when
we
get
into
mexico
city
what
a
shall
be
held
how
drunk
i
shall
get
people
in
on
to
torreon
at
yermo
there
is
nothing
but
leagues

on

drive
the

across
it
along
the

track
in

of

lay
ten
enormous
trains
pillars
of
fire
by
night
and
of
black
smoke
by
day
stretching
back
northward
farther
than
the
eye
could
reach
around
them
in
the
chaparral
camped
nine
thousand
men
without
shelter
each
man
s
horse
tied
to
the
mesquite
beside
him
where
hung
his
one
serape
and
red
strips
of
drying
meat
from
fifty
cars
horses
and
mules
were
being
unloaded
covered
with
sweat
and
dust
a
ragged
trooper
plunged
into
a
among
the
flying
hoofs
swung
himself
upon
a
horse
s
back
and
jabbed
his
spurs
deep
in
with
a
yell
then
came
a
terrific
drumming
of
frightened
animals
and
suddenly
a
horse
shot
violently
from
the
open
door
usually
backward
and
the
car
belched
flying
masses
of
horses
and
mules
picking
themselves
up
they
fled
in
terror
snorting
through
wide
nostrils
at
the
smell
of
the
open
then
the
wide
watchful
circle
of
troopers
turned
lifted
the
great
coils
of
their
lassoes
through
the
choking
dust
and
the
running
animals
swirled
round
and
round
upon
one
another
in
a
panic
officers
orderlies
generals
with
their
staffs
soldiers
with
halters
hunting
for
their
mounts
galloped
and
ran
past
in
inextricable
confusion
bucking
mules
were
being
harnessed
to
the
caissons
troopers
who
had
arrived
on
the
last
trains
wandered
about
looking
for
their
brigades
way
ahead
some
men
were
shooting
at
a
rabbit
from
the
tops
of
the
and
the
where
they
were
camped
by
hundreds
the
and
their
swarms
of
children
looked
down
screaming
shrill
advice
and
asking
everybody
in
general
if
they
had
happened
to
see
juan
moñeros
or
jesus
hernandez
or
whatever
the
name
of
their
man
happened
to
be
one
man
trailing
a
rifle
wandered
along
shouting
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
two
days
and
he
couldn
t
find
his
woman
who
made
his
for
him
and
he
opined
that
she
had
deserted
him
to
go
with
some
of
another
brigade
the
women
on
the
roofs
of
the
cars
said
dios
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
then
they
dropped
him
down
some
and
asked
him
for
the
love
he
bore
our
lady
of
guadelupe
to
lend
them
a
cigarette
a
clamorous
dirty
throng
stormed
the
engine
of
our
train
screaming
for
water
when
the
engineer
stood
them
off
with
a
revolver
telling
them
there
was
plenty
of
water
in
the
they
broke
away
and
aimlessly
scattered
while
a
fresh
throng
took
their
places
around
the
twelve
immense
a
fighting
mass
of
men
and
animals
struggled
for
a
place
at
the
little
faucets
ceaselessly
pouring
above
the
place
a
mighty
cloud
of
dust
seven
miles
long
and
a
mile
wide
towered
up
into
the
still
hot
air
and
with
the
black
smoke
of
the
engines
struck
wonder
and
terror
into
the
federal
outposts
fifty
miles
away
on
the
mountains
back
of
mapimi
when
villa
left
chihuahua
for
torreon
he
closed
the
telegraph
wires
to
the
north
stopped
train
service
to
juarez
and
forbade
on
pain
of
death
that
anyone
should
carry
or
send
news
of
his
departure
to
the
united
states
his
object
was
to
take
the
federals
by
surprise
and
it
worked
beautifully
no
one
not
even
villa
s
staff
knew
when
he
would
leave
chihuahua
the
army
had
delayed
there
so
long
that
we
all
believed
it
would
delay
another
two
weeks
and
then
saturday
morning
we
woke
to
find
the
telegraph
and
railway
cut
and
three
huge
trains
carrying
the
brigada
already
gone
the
zaragosa
left
the
next
day
and
villa
s
own
troops
the
following
morning
moving
with
the
swiftness
that
always
characterizes
him
villa
had
his
entire
army
concentrated
at
yermo
the
day
afterward
without
the
federals
knowing
that
he
had
left
chihuahua
there
was
a
mob
around
the
portable
field
telegraph
that
had
been
rigged
up
in
the
ruined
station
inside
the
instrument
was
clicking
soldiers
and
officers
indiscriminately
choked
up
the
windows
and
the
door
and
every
once
in
a
while
the
operator
would
shout
something
in
spanish
and
a
perfect
roar
of
laughter
would
go
up
it
seemed
that
the
telegraph
had
accidentally
tapped
a
wire
that
had
not
been
destroyed
by
the
wire
that
connected
with
the
federal
military
wire
from
mapimi
to
torreon
listen
cried
the
operator
colonel
argumedo
in
command
of
the
in
mapimi
is
telegraphing
to
general
velasco
in
torreon
he
says
that
he
sees
smoke
and
a
big
dust
cloud
to
the
north
and
thinks
that
some
rebel
troops
are
moving
south
from
escalon
night
came
with
a
cloudy
sky
and
a
rising
wind
that
began
to
lift
the
dust
along
the
miles
and
miles
of
trains
the
fires
of
the
flared
from
the
tops
of
the
out
into
the
desert
so
far
that
finally
they
were
mere
of
flame
stretched
the
innumerable
of
the
army
half
obscured
by
the
thick
billowing
dust
the
storm
completely
concealed
us
from
federal
watchers
even
god
remarked
major
leyva
even
god
is
on
the
side
of
francisco
villa
we
sat
at
dinner
in
our
converted
with
young
expressionless
general
maximo
garcia
and
his
brother
the
even
huger
benito
garcia
and
little
major
manuel
acosta
with
the
beautiful
manners
of
his
race
garcia
had
long
been
holding
the
advance
at
escalon
he
and
his
of
whom
josé
garcia
the
idol
of
the
army
had
been
killed
in
a
short
four
years
ago
were
wealthy
owners
of
immense
tracts
of
land
they
had
come
out
with
madero
i
remember
that
he
brought
us
a
jug
of
whisky
and
refused
to
discuss
the
revolution
declaring
that
he
was
fighting
for
better
whisky
as
i
write
this
comes
a
report
that
he
is
dead
from
a
bullet
wound
received
in
the
battle
of
sacramento
out
in
the
dust
storm
on
a
immediately
ahead
of
ours
some
soldiers
lay
around
their
fire
with
their
heads
in
their
women
s
laps
singing
the
cockroach
which
tells
in
hundreds
of
satirical
verses
what
the
constitutionalists
would
do
when
they
captured
juarez
and
chihuahua
from
mercado
and
orozco
above
the
wind
one
was
aware
of
the
immense
sullen
murmur
of
the
host
and
occasionally
some
sentry
challenged
in
a
falsetto
howl
vive
and
the
answer
gente
through
the
night
sounded
the
eerie
whistle
of
the
ten
locomotives
at
intervals
as
they
signaled
back
and
forth
to
one
another
army
at
at
dawn
next
morning
general
torribio
ortega
came
to
the
car
for
lean
dark
mexican
who
is
called
the
honorable
and
the
most
brave
by
the
soldiers
he
is
by
far
the
most
and
disinterested
soldier
in
mexico
he
never
kills
his
prisoners
he
has
refused
to
take
a
cent
from
the
revolution
beyond
his
meager
salary
villa
respects
and
trusts
him
perhaps
beyond
all
his
generals
ortega
was
a
poor
man
a
cowboy
he
sat
there
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
forgetting
his
breakfast
his
big
eyes
flashing
smiling
his
gentle
crooked
smile
and
told
us
why
he
was
fighting
i
am
not
an
educated
man
he
said
but
i
know
that
to
fight
is
the
last
thing
for
any
people
only
when
things
get
too
bad
to
stand
eh
and
if
we
are
going
to
kill
our
brothers
something
fine
must
come
out
of
it
eh
you
in
the
united
states
do
not
know
what
we
have
seen
we
mexicans
we
have
looked
on
at
the
robbing
of
our
people
the
simple
poor
people
for
years
eh
we
have
seen
the
and
the
soldiers
of
porfirio
diaz
shoot
down
our
brothers
and
our
fathers
and
justice
denied
to
them
we
have
seen
our
little
fields
taken
away
from
us
and
all
of
us
sold
into
slavery
eh
we
have
longed
for
our
homes
and
for
schools
to
teach
us
and
they
have
laughed
at
us
all
we
have
ever
wanted
was
to
be
let
alone
to
live
and
to
work
and
make
our
country
great
and
we
are
and
sick
of
being
cheated
outside
in
the
dust
that
whirled
along
under
a
sky
of
driving
clouds
long
lines
of
soldiers
on
horseback
stood
in
the
obscurity
while
their
officers
passed
along
in
front
peering
closely
at
and
rifles

a
captain
to
one

strings
of
cavalry
the
first
to
the
front
about
a
thousand
went
in
ten
different
lines
diverging
like
wheel
spokes
the
jingle
of
their
spurs
ringing
their
flags
floating
straight
out
crossed
bandoliers
gleaming
dully
rifles
flopping
across
their
saddles
heavy
high
sombreros
and
blankets
behind
each
company
plodded
ten
or
twelve
women
on
foot
carrying
cooking
utensils
on
their
heads
and
backs
and
perhaps
a
pack
mule
loaded
with
sacks
of
corn
and
as
they
passed
the
cars
they
shouted
back
to
their
friends
on
the
trains

one

and
singing
they
jogged
southwest
became
small
and
finally
faded
into
the
dust
villa

stood
leaning
against
a
car

in
his
pockets
he
wore
an
old
slouch
hat
a
dirty
shirt
without
a
collar
and
a
badly
frayed
and
shiny
brown
suit
all
over
the
dusty
plain
in
front
of
him
men
and
horses
had
sprung
up
like
magic
there
was
an
immense
confusion
of
saddling
and
cracked
blowing
of
tin
bugles
the
brigada
zaragosa
was
getting
ready
to
leave
flanking
column
of
two
thousand
men
who
were
to
ride
southeast
and
attack

and
sacramento

most
beautiful

i
am

it
was
harder
work
than
twenty
battles
then
he
listened
to
the
report
of
some
staff
officer
who
dashed
up
on
horseback
gave
a
concise
order
without
hesitating
and
the
officer
rode
off
he
told
señor

general
manager
of
the
railroad
in
what
order
the
trains
should
proceed
south
he
indicated
to
señor

the
what

be
distributed
from

to

gave

name
of
a
federal
captain
surrounded
by
urbina
s
men
a
week
before
and
killed
with
all
his
men
in
the
hills
near
la
cadena
and
ordered
him
to
tap
the
federal
wire
and
send
a
message
to
general
velasco
in
torreon
purporting
to
be
a
report
from
this
captain
from
conejos
and
asking
for
orders
he
seemed
to
know
and
order
everything
we
had
lunch
with
general
eugenio
aguirre
benavides
the
quiet
little
commander
of
the
zaragosa
brigade
a
member
of
one
of
the
cultivated
mexican
families
that
gathered
around
madero
in
the

of
the
murdered

colonel

perched
high
up
on
an
immense

a
ridiculous
tiny

not
more
than
five
feet
tall
he
was
waving
his
hand
and
shouting
a
greeting
across
to

bareheaded
in
a

thick
sweating

the
five
american
artillery
men
had
squatted
down
in
the
lee
of

smoking
they
hailed

with
a
shout
say
bo
what
in
hell
did
we
ever
get
into
this
mess
for
nothing
to
eat
since
last
twelve
take
our
pictures
will
you
there
passed
by
with
a
friendly
nod
the
little
cockney
soldier
that
had
served
with
kitchener
and
then
the
canadian
captain
treston
bawling
for
his
interpreter
so
that
he
could
give
his
men
some
orders
about
the
machine
guns
and
captain
marinelli
the
fat
italian
soldier
of
fortune
pouring
an
interminable
and
unintelligible
mixture
of
french
spanish
and
italian
into
the
ear
of
a
bored
mexican
officer
fierro
rode
by
cruelly
roweling
his
horse
with
the
bloody
the
handsome
cruel
and
butcher
they
called
him
because
he
killed
defenseless
prisoners
with
his
revolver
and
shot
down
his
own
men
without
provocation
late
in
the
afternoon
the
brigada
zaragosa
rode
away
southeast
over
the
desert
and
another
night
came
down
the
wind
rose
steadily
in
the
darkness
growing
colder
and
colder
looking
up
at
the
sky
which
had
been
ablaze
with
polished
stars
i
saw
that
all
was
dark
with
cloud
through
the
roaring
whirls
of
dust
a
thousand
thin
lines
of
sparks
from
the
fires
streamed
southward
the
coaling
of
the
engines
fire
boxes
made
sudden
glares
along
the
miles
of
trains
at
first
we
thought
we
heard
the
sound
of
big
guns
in
the
distance
but
all
at
once
unexpectedly
the
sky
split
dazzlingly
open
from
horizon
to
horizon
thunder
fell
like
a
blow
and
the
rain
came
level
and
thick
as
a
flood
for
a
moment
the
human
hum
of
the
army
was
silenced
all
the
fires
disappeared
at
once
and
then
came
a
vast
shout
of
anger
and
laughter
and
discomfiture
from
the
soldiers
out
on
the
plain
and
the
most
amazing
wail
of
misery
from
the
women
that
i
have
ever
heard
the
two
sounds
only
lasted
a
minute
the
men
wrapped
themselves
in
their
serapes
and
sank
down
in
the
shelter
of
the
chaparral
and
the
hundreds
of
women
and
children
exposed
to
the
cold
and
the
rain
on
the
and
the
tops
of
the
silently
and
with
indian
stoicism
settled
down
to
wait
for
dawn
in
general
maclovio
herrera
s
car
ahead
was
drunken
laughter
and
singing
to
a
guitar
daybreak
came
with
a
sound
of
all
the
bugles
in
the
world
blowing
and
looking
out
of
the
car
door
i
saw
the
desert
for
miles
boiling
with
armed
men
saddling
and
mounting
a
hot
sun
popped
over
the
western
mountains
burning
in
a
clear
sky
for
a
moment
the
ground
poured
up
billowing
steam
and
then
there
was
dust
again
and
a
thirsty
land
there
might
never
have
been
rain
a
hundred
breakfast
fires
smoked
from
the
and
the
women
stood
turning
their
dresses
slowly
in
the
sun
chattering
and
joking
hundreds
of
little
naked
babies
danced
around
while
their
mothers
lifted
up
their
little
clothes
to
the
heat
a
thousand
joyous
troopers
shouted
to
each
other
that
the
advance
was
beginning
away
off
to
the
left
some
regiment
had
given
away
to
joy
and
was
shooting
into
the
air
six
more
long
trains
had
come
in
during
the
night
and
all
the
engines
were
whistling
signals
i
went
forward
to
get
on
the
first
train
out
and
as
i
passed
the
car
of
trinidad
rodriguez
a
harsh
feminine
voice
cried
hey
kid
come
in
and
get
some
breakfast
leaning
out
of
the
door
were
beatrice
and
carmen
two
noted
juarez
women
that
had
been
brought
to
the
front
by
the
rodriguez
brothers
i
went
in
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
about
twelve
men
several
of
them
doctors
in
the
hospital
train
one
french
artillery
captain
and
an
assortment
of
mexican
officers
and
privates
it
was
an
ordinary
freight
like
all
the
private
cars
with
windows
cut
in
the
walls
partitions
built
to
shut
out
the
chinese
cook
in
the
kitchen
and
bunks
arranged
across
sides
and
end
breakfast
consisted
of
heaping
platters
of
red
meat
with
bowls
of
stacks
of
cold
flour
and
six
bottles
of
monopole
champagne
carmen
s
complexion
was
bad
and
she
was
a
little
stupid
from
the
gastronomic
combination
but
beatrice
s
white
colorless
face
and
red
hair
cut
buster
brown
fashion
fairly
radiated
a
sort
of
malicious
glee
she
was
a
mexican
but
talked
tenderloin
english
without
an
accent
jumping
up
from
the
table
she
danced
around
it
pulling
the
men
s
hair
hello
you
damned
gringo
she
laughed
at
me
what
are
you
doing
here
you
re
going
to
get
a
bullet
in
you
if
you
don
t
get
careful
a
morose
young
mexican
already
a
little
drunk
snapped
at
her
furiously
in
spanish
don
t
you
talk
to
him
do
you
understand
i
ll
tell
trinidad
how
you
asked
the
gringo
in
to
breakfast
and
he
ll
have
you
shot
beatrice
threw
back
her
head
and
roared
did
you
hear
what
he
said
he
thinks
he
owns
me
because
he
once
stayed
with
me
in
juarez
my
god
she
went
on
how
funny
it
seems
to
travel
on
the
railroad
and
not
have
to
buy
a
ticket
look
here
beatrice
i
asked
her
we
may
not
have
such
an
easy
time
of
it
down
there
what
will
you
do
if
we
get
licked
who
me
she
cried
why
i
guess
it
won
t
take
me
long
to
get
friends
in
the
federal
army
i
m
a
good
mixer
what
is
she
saying
what
do
you
say
asked
the
others
in
spanish
with
the
most
perfect
insolence
beatrice
translated
for
them
and
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
that
followed
i
left
the
water
train
pulled
out
first
i
rode
on
the
of
the
engine
which
was
already
occupied
by
the
permanent
home
of
two
women
and
five
children
they
had
built
a
little
fire
of
mesquite
twigs
on
the
narrow
iron
platform
and
were
baking
there
over
their
heads
against
the
windy
roar
of
the
boiler
fluttered
a
little
line
of
wash
it
was
a
brilliant
day
hot
sunshine
alternating
with
big
white
clouds
in
two
thick
columns
one
on
each
side
of
the
train
the
army
was
already
moving
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
a
mighty
double
cloud
of
dust
floated
over
them
and
little
straggling
groups
of
mounted
men
jogged
along
with
every
now
and
then
a
big
mexican
flag
between
slowly
moved
the
trains
the
pillars
of
black
smoke
from
their
engines
at
regular
intervals
growing
smaller
until
over
the
northern
horizon
only
a
dirty
mist
appeared
i
went
down
into
the
caboose
to
get
a
drink
of
water
and
there
i
found
the
conductor
of
the
train
lying
in
his
bunk
reading
the
bible
he
was
so
interested
and
amused
that
he
didn
t
notice
me
for
a
minute
when
he
did
he
cried
delightedly
i
have
found
a
great
story
about
a
chap
called
samson
who
was
good
deal
of
a
his
woman
she
was
a
spaniard
i
guess
from
the
mean
trick
she
played
on
him
he
started
out
being
a
good
revolutionist
a
maderista
and
she
made
him
a
means
literally
cropped
head
and
is
the
slang
term
for
a
federal
soldier
because
the
federal
army
is
largely
recruited
from
the
prisons
our
advance
guard
with
a
telegraph
field
operator
had
gone
on
to
conejos
the
night
before
and
they
met
the
train
in
great
excitement
the
first
blood
of
the
campaign
had
been
spilt
a
few
scouting
northward
from
bermejillo
had
been
surprised
and
killed
just
behind
the
shoulder
of
the
big
mountain
which
lies
to
the
east
the
telegrapher
also
had
news
he
had
again
tapped
the
federal
wire
and
sent
to
the
federal
commander
in
torreon
signing
the
dead
captain
s
name
and
asking
for
orders
since
a
large
force
of
rebels
seemed
to
be
approaching
from
the
north
general
velasco
replied
that
the
captain
should
hold
conejos
and
throw
out
outposts
to
the
north
to
try
and
discover
how
large
the
force
was
at
the
same
time
the
telegrapher
had
heard
a
message
from
argumedo
in
command
at
mapimi
saying
that
the
entire
north
of
mexico
was
coming
down
on
torreon
together
with
the
gringo
army
conejos
was
just
like
yermo
except
that
there
was
no
water
tank
a
thousand
men
with
old
general
rosalio
hernandez
riding
ahead
went
out
almost
at
once
and
the
repair
train
followed
them
a
few
miles
to
a
place
where
the
federals
had
burned
two
railroad
bridges
a
few
months
before
out
beyond
the
last
little
bivouac
of
the
immense
army
spread
around
us
the
desert
slept
silently
in
the
heat
waves
there
was
no
wind
the
men
gathered
with
their
women
on
the
guitars
came
out
and
all
night
hundreds
of
singing
voices
came
from
the
trains
the
next
morning
i
went
to
see
villa
in
his
car
this
was
a
red
caboose
with
chintz
curtains
on
the
windows
the
famous
little
caboose
which
villa
has
used
in
all
his
journeys
since
the
fall
of
juarez
it
was
divided
by
partitions
into
two
kitchen
and
the
general
s
bedroom
this
tiny
room
ten
by
twenty
feet
was
the
heart
of
the
constitutionalist
army
there
were
held
all
the
councils
of
war
and
there
was
scarcely
room
enough
for
the
fifteen
generals
who
met
there
in
these
councils
the
vital
immediate
questions
of
the
campaign
were
discussed
the
generals
decided
what
was
to
be
done
then
villa
gave
his
orders
to
suit
himself
it
was
painted
a
dirty
gray
on
the
walls
were
tacked
photographs
of
showy
ladies
in
theatrical
poses
a
large
picture
of
carranza
one
of
fierro
and
a
picture
of
villa
himself
two
wooden
bunks
folded
up
against
the
wall
in
one
of
which
villa
and
general
angeles
slept
and
in
the
other
josé
rodriguez
and
doctor
raschbaum
villa
s
personal
physician
that
was
all
desea
what
do
you
want
said
villa
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
bunk
in
blue
underclothes
the
troopers
who
lounged
around
the
place
lazily
made
way
for
me
i
want
a
horse
our
friend
here
wants
a
horse
grinned
villa
sarcastically
amid
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
others
why
you
correspondents
will
be
wanting
an
automobile
next
señor
reporter
do
you
know
that
about
a
thousand
men
in
my
army
have
no
horses
here
s
the
train
what
do
you
want
a
horse
for
so
i
can
ride
with
the
advance
no
he
smiled
there
are
too
many
many
bullets
flying
in
the
advance
he
was
hurrying
into
his
clothes
as
he
talked
and
gulping
coffee
from
the
side
of
a
dirty
tin
somebody
handed
him
his
sword
no
he
said
contemptuously
this
is
to
be
a
fight
not
a
parade
give
me
my
rifle
he
stood
at
the
door
of
his
caboose
for
a
moment
thoughtfully
looking
at
the
long
lines
of
mounted
men
picturesque
in
their
crossed
and
varied
equipment
then
he
gave
a
few
quick
orders
and
mounted
his
big
stallion
cried
villa
the
bugles
brayed
and
a
subdued
silver
clicking
ringing
sounded
as
the
companies
wheeled
and
trotted
southward
in
the
dust
and
so
the
army
disappeared
during
the
day
we
thought
we
heard
cannonading
from
the
southwest
where
urbina
was
reported
to
be
coming
down
from
the
mountains
to
attack
mapimi
and
late
in
the
afternoon
news
came
of
the
capture
of
bermejillo
and
a
courier
from
benavides
said
that
he
had
taken
tlahualilo
we
were
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
be
off
about
sundown
señor
calzado
remarked
that
the
repair
train
would
leave
in
an
hour
so
i
grabbed
a
blanket
and
walked
a
mile
up
the
line
of
trains
to
it
the
the
first
car
of
the
repair
train
was
a
upon
which
was
mounted
the
famous
constitutionalist
cannon
el
niño
with
an
open
caisson
full
of
shells
behind
it
behind
that
was
an
armored
car
full
of
soldiers
then
a
car
of
steel
rails
and
four
loaded
with
railroad
ties
the
engine
came
next
the
engineer
and
fireman
hung
with
their
rifles
handy
then
followed
two
or
three
full
of
soldiers
and
their
women
it
was
a
dangerous
business
a
large
force
of
federals
were
known
to
be
in
mapimi
and
the
country
swarmed
with
their
outposts
our
army
was
already
far
ahead
except
for
five
hundred
men
who
guarded
the
trains
at
conejos
if
the
enemy
could
capture
or
wreck
the
repair
train
the
army
would
be
cut
off
without
water
food
or
ammunition
in
the
darkness
we
moved
out
i
sat
upon
the
breech
of
el
niño
chatting
with
captain
diaz
the
commander
of
the
gun
as
he
oiled
the
breech
lock
of
his
beloved
cannon
and
curled
his
vertical
mustachios
in
the
armored
recess
behind
the
gun
where
the
captain
slept
i
heard
a
curious
subdued
rustling
noise
what
s
that
eh
cried
he
nervously
oh
nothing
nothing
just
then
there
emerged
a
young
indian
girl
with
a
bottle
in
her
hand
she
couldn
t
have
been
more
than
seventeen
very
lovely
the
captain
shot
a
glance
at
me
and
suddenly
whirled
around
what
are
you
doing
here
he
cried
furiously
to
her
why
are
you
coming
out
here
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
a
drink
she
began
i
perceived
that
i
was
one
too
many
and
excused
myself
they
hardly
noticed
me
but
as
i
was
climbing
over
the
back
of
the
car
i
couldn
t
help
stopping
and
listening
they
had
gone
back
to
the
recess
and
she
was
weeping
didn
t
i
tell
you
stormed
the
captain
not
to
show
yourself
when
there
are
strangers
here
i
will
not
have
every
man
in
mexico
looking
at
you
i
stood
on
the
roof
of
the
rocking
steel
car
as
we
nosed
slowly
along
lying
on
their
bellies
on
the
extreme
front
platform
two
men
with
lanterns
examined
each
foot
of
the
track
for
wires
that
might
mean
mines
planted
under
us
beneath
my
feet
the
soldiers
and
their
women
were
having
dinner
around
fires
built
on
the
floor
smoke
and
laughter
poured
out
of
the
loopholes
there
were
other
fires
aft
ragged
people
squatting
at
them
on
the
overhead
the
sky
blazed
stars
without
a
cloud
it
was
cold
after
an
hour
of
riding
we
came
to
a
piece
of
broken
track
the
train
stopped
with
a
jar
the
engine
whistled
and
a
score
of
torches
and
lanterns
jerked
past
men
came
running
the
flares
clustered
bobbing
together
as
the
foremen
examined
the
damage
a
fire
sprang
up
in
the
brush
and
then
another
soldiers
of
the
train
guard
straggled
by
dragging
their
rifles
and
formed
impenetrable
walls
around
the
fires
iron
tools
clanged
and
the
of
men
shoving
rails
off
the
a
chinese
dragon
of
workmen
passed
with
a
rail
on
their
shoulders
then
others
with
ties
four
hundred
men
swarmed
upon
the
broken
spot
working
with
extraordinary
energy
and
good
humor
until
the
shouts
of
gangs
setting
rails
and
ties
and
the
rattle
of
sledges
on
spikes
made
a
continuous
roar
it
was
an
old
destruction
probably
a
year
old
made
when
these
same
constitutionalists
were
retreating
north
in
the
face
of
mercado
s
federal
army
and
we
had
it
all
fixed
in
an
hour
then
on
again
sometimes
it
was
a
bridge
burned
out
sometimes
a
hundred
yards
of
track
twisted
into
grape
vines
by
a
chain
and
a
backing
engine
we
advanced
slowly
at
one
big
bridge
that
it
would
take
two
hours
to
prepare
i
built
by
myself
a
little
fire
in
order
to
get
warm
calzado
came
past
and
hailed
me
we
ve
got
a
up
ahead
he
said
and
we
re
going
along
down
and
see
the
dead
men
want
to
come
what
dead
men
why
this
morning
an
outpost
of
eighty
was
sent
scouting
north
from
bermejillo
we
heard
about
it
over
the
wire
and
informed
benavides
on
the
left
he
sent
a
troop
to
take
them
in
the
rear
and
drove
them
north
in
a
running
fight
for
fifteen
miles
until
they
smashed
up
against
our
main
body
and
not
one
got
out
alive
they
re
scattered
along
the
whole
way
just
where
they
fell
in
a
moment
we
were
speeding
south
on
the
at
our
right
hand
and
our
left
rode
two
silent
shadowy
figures
on
guards
with
rifles
ready
under
their
arms
soon
the
flares
and
fires
of
the
train
were
left
behind
and
we
were
enveloped
and
smothered
in
the
vast
silence
of
the
desert
yes
said
calzado
the
are
brave
they
are
are
the
best
fighters
diaz
and
huerta
ever
had
they
never
desert
to
the
revolution
they
always
remain
loyal
to
the
established
government
because
they
are
police
it
was
bitter
cold
none
of
us
talked
much
we
go
ahead
of
the
train
at
night
said
the
soldier
at
my
left
so
that
if
there
are
any
dynamite
bombs
we
could
discover
them
and
dig
them
out
and
put
water
in
them
said
another
sarcastically
the
rest
laughed
i
began
to
think
of
that
and
it
made
me
shiver
the
dead
silence
of
the
desert
seemed
an
expectant
hush
one
couldn
t
see
ten
feet
from
the
track
shouted
one
of
the
horsemen
it
was
just
here
that
one
lay
the
brakes
ground
and
we
tumbled
off
and
down
the
steep
embankment
our
lanterns
jerking
ahead
something
lay
huddled
around
the
foot
of
a
telegraph
infinitely
small
and
shabby
like
a
pile
of
old
clothes
the
was
upon
his
back
twisted
sideways
from
his
hips
he
had
been
stripped
of
everything
of
value
by
the
thrifty
hat
underclothing
they
had
left
him
his
ragged
jacket
with
the
tarnished
silver
braid
because
there
were
seven
bullet
holes
in
it
and
his
trousers
soaked
with
blood
he
had
evidently
been
much
bigger
when
dead
shrink
so
a
wild
red
beard
made
the
pallor
of
his
face
grotesque
until
you
noticed
that
under
it
and
the
dirt
and
the
long
lines
of
sweat
of
his
terrible
fight
and
hard
riding
his
mouth
was
gently
and
serenely
open
as
if
he
slept
his
brains
had
been
blown
out
said
one
guard
there
was
a
shot
for
the
dirty
goat
right
through
the
head
the
others
laughed
why
you
don
t
think
they
shot
him
there
in
the
fight
do
you
cried
his
companion
no
they
go
around
and
make
sure
hurry
up
i
ve
found
the
other
shouted
a
voice
off
in
the
darkness
we
could
reconstruct
this
man
s
last
struggle
he
had
dropped
off
his
horse
there
was
blood
on
the
a
little
dry
arroyo
we
could
even
see
where
his
horse
had
stood
while
he
pumped
shells
into
his
mauser
with
feverish
hands
and
blazed
away
first
to
the
rear
where
the
pursuers
came
running
with
indian
yells
and
then
at
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
bloodthirsty
horsemen
pouring
down
from
the
north
with
the
demon
pancho
villa
at
their
head
he
must
have
fought
a
long
time
perhaps
until
they
ringed
him
round
with
living
we
found
hundreds
of
empty
cartridges
and
then
when
the
last
shot
was
spent
he
made
a
dash
eastward
hit
at
every
step
hid
for
a
moment
under
the
little
railroad
bridge
and
ran
out
upon
the
open
desert
where
he
fell
there
were
twenty
bullet
holes
in
him
they
had
stripped
him
of
all
save
his
underclothes
he
lay
sprawled
in
an
attitude
of
desperate
action
muscles
tense
one
fist
clenched
and
spread
across
the
dust
as
if
he
were
dealing
a
blow
the
fiercest
exultant
grin
on
his
face
strong
savage
until
one
looked
closer
and
saw
the
subtle
touch
of
weakness
that
death
stamps
on
delicate
expression
of
idiocy
over
it
all
they
had
shot
him
through
the
head
three
exasperated
they
must
have
been
crawling
south
through
the
cold
night
once
more
a
few
miles
and
then
a
bridge
dynamited
or
a
strip
of
track
wrecked
the
stop
the
dancing
torches
the
great
bonfires
leaping
up
from
the
desert
and
the
four
hundred
wild
men
pouring
furiously
out
and
falling
upon
their
work
villa
had
given
orders
to
hurry
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
came
upon
two
squatting
around
a
fire
and
asked
them
if
they
could
give
me
and
coffee
one
was
an
old
indian
woman
with
a
perpetual
grin
the
other
a
slight
girl
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
who
was
nursing
a
baby
at
her
breast
they
were
perched
at
the
extreme
tip
of
a
their
fire
built
upon
a
pile
of
sand
as
the
train
jolted
and
swayed
along
around
them
backed
against
them
feet
sticking
out
between
them
was
a
great
inconglomerate
mass
of
sleeping
snoring
humans
the
rest
of
the
train
was
by
this
time
dark
this
was
the
only
patch
of
light
and
warmth
in
the
night
as
i
munched
my
and
the
old
woman
lifted
a
burning
coal
in
her
fingers
to
light
her
cigarette
wondering
where
her
pablo
s
brigade
was
this
night
and
the
girl
nursed
her
child
crooning
to
it
her
twinkling
talked
ah
it
is
a
life
for
us
said
the
girl
but
we
follow
our
men
out
in
the
campaign
and
then
do
not
know
from
hour
to
hour
whether
they
live
or
die
i
remember
well
when
filadelfo
called
to
me
one
morning
in
the
little
morning
before
it
was
lived
in
said
come
we
are
going
out
to
fight
because
the
good
pancho
madero
has
been
murdered
this
day
we
had
only
been
loving
each
other
eight
months
too
and
the
first
baby
was
not
born
we
had
all
believed
that
peace
was
in
mexico
for
good
filadelfo
saddled
the
burro
and
we
rode
out
through
the
streets
just
as
light
was
coming
and
into
the
fields
where
the
farmers
were
not
yet
at
work
and
i
said
why
must
i
come
and
he
answered
shall
i
starve
then
who
shall
make
my
for
me
but
my
woman
it
took
us
three
months
to
get
north
and
i
was
sick
and
the
baby
was
born
in
a
desert
just
like
this
place
and
died
there
because
we
could
not
get
water
that
was
when
villa
was
going
north
after
he
had
taken
torreon
the
old
woman
broke
in
yes
and
all
that
is
true
when
we
go
so
far
and
suffer
so
much
for
our
men
we
are
cruelly
treated
by
the
stupid
animals
of
generals
i
am
from
san
luis
potosi
and
my
man
was
in
the
artillery
of
the
federacion
when
mercado
came
north
all
the
way
to
chihuahua
we
traveled
the
old
fool
of
a
mercado
grumbling
about
transporting
the
and
then
he
ordered
his
army
to
go
north
and
attack
villa
in
juarez
and
he
forbade
the
women
to
go
is
that
the
way
you
are
going
to
do
i
said
to
myself
and
when
he
evacuated
chihuahua
and
ran
away
with
my
man
to
ojinaga
i
just
stayed
right
in
chihuahua
and
got
a
man
in
the
maderista
army
when
it
came
in
a
nice
handsome
young
fellow
too
better
than
juan
i
m
not
a
woman
to
stand
being
put
upon
how
much
are
the
and
coffee
i
asked
they
looked
at
each
other
startled
evidently
they
had
thought
me
one
of
the
penniless
soldiers
crowded
on
the
train
what
you
would
like
said
the
young
woman
faintly
i
gave
them
a
peso
the
old
woman
exploded
in
a
torrent
of
prayer
god
his
sainted
mother
the
blessed
niño
and
our
lady
of
guadelupe
have
sent
this
stranger
to
us
tonight
here
we
had
not
a
centavo
to
buy
coffee
and
flour
with
i
suddenly
noticed
that
the
light
of
our
fire
had
paled
and
looked
up
in
amazement
to
find
it
was
dawn
just
then
a
man
came
running
along
the
train
from
up
front
shouting
something
unintelligible
while
laughter
and
shouts
burst
out
in
his
wake
the
sleepers
raised
their
curious
heads
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
in
a
moment
our
inanimate
car
was
alive
the
man
passed
still
yelling
something
about
his
face
exultant
with
some
tremendous
joke
what
is
it
i
asked
oh
cried
the
old
woman
his
woman
on
the
car
ahead
has
just
had
a
baby
just
in
front
of
us
lay
bermejillo
its
pink
and
blue
and
white
plastered
adobe
houses
as
delicate
and
ethereal
as
a
village
of
porcelain
to
the
east
across
a
still
dustless
desert
a
little
file
of
horsemen
with
a
flag
over
them
were
riding
into
town
the
gates
of
we
had
taken
bermejillo
the
afternoon
before
army
breaking
into
a
furious
gallop
five
kilometers
north
of
the
town
and
pouring
through
it
at
top
speed
driving
the
unprepared
garrison
in
a
rout
southward
running
fight
that
lasted
five
miles
as
far
as
the
hacienda
of
santa
clara
killing
a
hundred
and
six
within
a
few
hours
afterward
urbina
came
in
sight
above
mapimi
and
the
eight
hundred
there
informed
of
the
astonishing
news
that
the
entire
constitutionalist
army
was
flanking
them
on
their
right
evacuated
the
place
and
fled
hotly
to
torreon
all
over
the
country
the
astounded
federals
were
falling
back
in
a
panic
upon
the
city
late
in
the
afternoon
a
dumpy
little
train
came
down
the
track
from
the
direction
of
mapimi
and
from
it
proceeded
the
loud
strains
of
a
string
orchestra
of
ten
pieces
playing
of
durango
which
i
had
so
often
d
with
the
tropa
the
roofs
doors
and
windows
were
packed
with
mexicans
singing
and
beating
time
with
their
heels
as
they
fired
their
rifles
in
a
sort
of
salute
upon
entering
the
town
at
the
station
this
curious
equipage
drew
up
and
from
it
but
patricio
general
urbina
s
fighting
at
whose
side
i
had
so
often
ridden
and
danced
he
threw
his
arms
around
me
yelling
juanito
here
is
juanito
in
a
minute
we
were
asking
and
answering
each
other
a
million
questions
did
i
have
the
photographs
i
took
of
him
was
i
going
to
the
battle
of
torreon
did
he
know
where
don
petronilo
was
and
pablo
seañes
and
raphaelito
and
right
in
the
midst
of
it
somebody
shouted
viva
urbina
and
the
old
general
himself
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
hero
of
durango
he
was
lame
and
leaned
upon
two
soldiers
he
held
a
rifle
in
his
hand
old
discarded
springfield
with
the
sights
filed
down
wore
a
double
around
his
waist
for
a
moment
he
remained
there
absolutely
expressionless
his
small
hard
eyes
boring
into
me
i
thought
he
did
not
recognize
me
when
all
at
once
his
harsh
sudden
voice
shot
out
that
s
not
the
camera
you
had
where
s
the
other
one
i
was
about
to
reply
when
he
interrupted
i
know
you
left
it
behind
you
in
la
cadena
did
you
run
very
fast
yes
and
you
ve
come
down
to
torreon
to
run
again
when
i
began
to
run
from
la
cadena
i
remarked
nettled
don
petronilo
and
the
troops
were
already
a
mile
away
he
didn
t
answer
but
came
haltingly
down
the
steps
of
the
car
while
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
soldiers
coming
up
to
me
he
put
a
hand
over
my
shoulder
and
gave
me
a
little
tap
on
the
back
i
m
glad
to
see
you
he
said
across
the
desert
the
wounded
had
begun
to
straggle
in
from
the
battle
of
tlahualilo
to
the
hospital
train
which
lay
far
up
near
the
front
of
the
line
of
trains
on
the
flat
barren
plain
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
were
only
three
living
things
in
sight
a
limping
hatless
man
with
his
head
tied
up
in
a
bloody
cloth
another
staggering
beside
his
staggering
horse
and
a
mule
mounted
by
two
bandaged
figures
far
behind
them
and
in
the
still
hot
night
we
could
hear
from
our
car
groans
and
screams
late
sunday
morning
we
were
again
on
el
niño
at
the
head
of
the
repair
train
moving
slowly
down
the
track
abreast
of
the
army
el
chavalito
another
cannon
mounted
on
a
was
coupled
behind
then
came
two
armored
cars
and
the
this
time
there
were
no
women
the
army
wore
a
different
air
winding
along
in
two
immense
serpents
each
side
of
was
little
laughter
or
shouting
we
were
close
now
only
eighteen
miles
from
gomez
palacio
and
no
one
knew
what
the
federals
planned
to
do
it
seemed
incredible
that
they
would
let
us
get
so
close
without
making
one
stand
immediately
south
of
bermejillo
we
entered
a
new
land
to
the
desert
succeeded
fields
bordered
with
irrigation
ditches
along
which
grew
immense
green
alamos
towering
pillars
of
freshness
after
the
baked
desolation
we
had
just
passed
through
here
were
the
white
tufts
unpicked
and
rotting
on
their
stalks
with
sparse
green
blades
just
showing
along
the
big
ditches
flowed
swift
deep
water
in
the
shade
birds
sang
and
the
barren
western
mountains
marched
steadily
nearer
as
we
went
south
it
was
moist
summer
such
as
we
have
at
home
a
deserted
lay
on
our
left
hundreds
of
white
bales
tumbled
in
the
sun
and
dazzling
heaps
of
left
just
as
the
workmen
had
piled
it
months
before
at
santa
clara
the
massed
columns
of
the
army
halted
and
began
to
defile
to
left
and
right
thin
lines
of
troops
jogging
out
under
the
checkered
sun
and
shade
of
the
great
trees
until
six
thousand
men
were
spread
in
one
long
single
front
to
the
right
over
fields
and
through
ditches
beyond
the
last
cultivated
field
across
the
desert
to
the
very
base
of
the
mountains
to
the
left
over
the
roll
of
the
flat
world
the
bugles
blared
faintly
and
near
and
the
army
moved
forward
in
a
mighty
line
across
the
whole
country
above
them
lifted
a
golden
flags
flapped
in
the
center
level
with
them
came
the
and
beside
that
villa
rode
with
his
staff
at
the
little
villages
along
the
way
the
stood
in
silent
wonder
watching
this
strange
host
pass
an
old
man
drove
his
goats
homeward
the
foaming
wave
of
troopers
broke
upon
him
yelling
with
pure
mischief
and
all
the
goats
ran
in
different
directions
a
mile
of
army
shouted
with
laughter
dust
rolled
up
from
their
thousand
hoofs
and
they
passed
at
the
village
of
brittingham
the
great
line
halted
while
villa
and
his
staff
galloped
up
to
the
peons
watching
from
their
little
mound
said
villa
have
any
troops
passed
through
here
lately
señor
answered
several
men
at
once
some
of
don
carlo
argumedo
s
went
by
yesterday
pretty
fast
hum
villa
meditated
have
you
seen
that
bandit
pancho
villa
around
here
no
señor
they
chorused
well
he
s
the
fellow
i
m
looking
for
if
i
catch
that
it
will
go
hard
with
him
we
wish
you
all
success
cried
the
politely
you
never
saw
him
did
you
no
god
forbid
they
said
fervently
well
grinned
villa
in
the
future
when
people
ask
if
you
know
him
you
will
have
to
admit
the
shameful
fact
i
am
pancho
villa
and
with
that
he
spurred
away
and
all
the
army
followed
compañeros
such
had
been
the
surprise
of
the
federals
and
they
had
fled
in
such
a
hurry
that
for
many
miles
the
railroad
was
intact
but
toward
afternoon
we
began
to
find
little
bridges
burned
and
still
smoking
and
telegraph
poles
cut
down
with
an
and
hastily
done
bits
of
destruction
that
were
easily
repaired
but
the
army
had
got
far
ahead
and
by
nightfall
about
eight
miles
from
gomez
palacio
we
reached
the
place
where
eight
solid
miles
of
track
began
there
was
no
food
on
our
train
we
had
only
a
blanket
apiece
and
it
was
cold
in
the
flare
of
torches
and
fires
the
repair
gang
fell
upon
their
work
shouts
and
hammering
steel
and
the
thud
of
falling
ties
it
was
a
black
night
with
a
few
dim
stars
we
had
settled
down
around
one
fire
talking
and
drowsing
when
suddenly
a
new
sound
smote
the
sound
heavier
than
hammers
and
deeper
than
the
wind
it
was
still
then
came
a
steady
roll
as
of
distant
drums
and
then
shock
shock
the
hammers
fell
voices
were
silent
we
were
frozen
somewhere
ahead
out
of
sight
in
the
still
it
was
that
the
air
carried
every
and
the
army
had
flung
themselves
upon
gomez
palacio
and
the
battle
had
begun
it
deepened
steadily
and
slowly
until
the
booffs
of
cannon
fell
echoing
upon
each
other
and
the
rifle
fire
rippled
like
steel
rain
screamed
a
hoarse
voice
from
the
roof
of
the
what
are
you
doing
get
at
that
track
pancho
villa
is
waiting
for
the
trains
and
with
a
yell
four
hundred
raging
maniacs
flung
themselves
upon
the
break
i
remember
how
we
besought
the
colonel
in
command
to
let
us
go
to
the
front
he
would
not
orders
were
strict
that
no
one
should
leave
the
trains
we
pled
with
him
offered
him
money
almost
got
on
our
knees
to
him
finally
he
relented
a
little
at
three
o
clock
he
said
i
ll
give
you
the
sign
and
countersign
and
let
you
go
we
curled
miserably
about
a
little
fire
of
our
own
trying
to
sleep
trying
at
least
to
get
warm
around
us
and
ahead
the
flares
and
the
men
danced
along
the
ruined
track
and
every
hour
or
so
the
train
would
creep
forward
a
hundred
feet
and
stop
again
it
was
not
hard
to
rails
were
intact
a
wrecker
had
been
hitched
to
the
rail
and
the
ties
twisted
splintered
torn
from
their
bed
always
the
monotonous
and
disturbing
furious
sound
of
battle
filtered
out
of
the
blackness
ahead
it
was
so
tiresome
so
much
the
that
sound
and
yet
i
could
not
sleep
about
midnight
one
of
our
outposts
galloped
from
the
rear
of
the
trains
to
report
that
a
large
body
of
horsemen
had
been
challenged
coming
from
the
north
who
said
they
were
urbina
s
from
mapimi
the
colonel
didn
t
know
of
any
body
of
troops
that
were
to
pass
at
that
time
of
night
in
a
minute
everything
was
a
fury
of
preparation
armed
and
mounted
men
galloped
like
mad
to
the
rear
with
orders
to
stop
the
newcomers
for
fifteen
minutes
they
were
constitutionalists
by
order
of
the
colonel
if
not
by
holding
them
off
as
long
as
possible
the
workmen
were
hurried
back
to
the
train
and
given
their
rifles
the
fires
were
put
out
the
flares
but
ten
our
guard
of
two
hundred
slipped
silently
into
the
thick
brush
loading
their
rifles
as
they
went
on
either
side
of
the
track
the
colonel
and
five
of
his
men
took
up
their
posts
unarmed
with
torches
held
high
over
their
heads
and
then
out
of
the
thick
blackness
the
head
of
the
column
appeared
it
was
made
up
of
different
men
from
the
soldiers
of
villa
s
army
these
were
ragged
gaunt
people
wrapped
in
faded
tattered
serapes
without
shoes
on
their
feet
crowned
with
the
heavy
picturesque
sombreros
of
the
lasso
ropes
hung
coiled
at
their
saddles
their
mounts
were
the
lean
hard
ponies
of
the
durango
mountains
they
rode
sullenly
contemptuous
of
us
they
neither
knew
the
countersign
nor
cared
to
know
it
and
as
they
rode
whole
files
sang
the
monotonous
extemporaneous
ballads
that
the
peons
compose
and
sing
to
themselves
as
they
guard
the
cattle
at
night
on
the
great
upland
plains
of
the
north
and
suddenly
as
i
stood
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
flares
a
passing
horse
was
jerked
to
his
haunches
and
a
voice
i
knew
cried
hey
meester
the
enfolding
serape
was
cast
high
in
the
air
the
man
fell
from
his
horse
and
in
a
moment
i
was
clasped
in
the
arms
of
isidro
amaya
behind
him
burst
forth
a
chorus
of
shouts
tal
meester
o
juanito
how
glad
we
are
to
see
you
where
have
you
been
they
said
you
were
killed
in
la
cadena
did
you
run
fast
from
the
eh
they
threw
themselves
to
the
ground
clustering
around
fifty
men
reaching
at
once
to
pat
me
on
the
back
all
my
dearest
friends
in
of
la
tropa
and
the
cadena
the
long
file
of
men
blocked
in
the
darkness
raised
a
chorus
of
shouts
move
on
what
s
the
matter
hurry
up
we
can
t
stay
here
all
night
and
the
others
yelled
back
here
s
meester
here
s
the
gringo
we
were
telling
you
about
who
danced
the
in
la
zarca
who
was
in
la
cadena
and
then
the
others
crowded
forward
too
there
were
twelve
hundred
of
them
silently
sullenly
eagerly
sniffing
the
battle
ahead
they
defiled
between
the
double
line
of
torches
and
every
tenth
man
i
had
known
before
as
they
passed
the
colonel
shouted
to
them
what
is
the
countersign
turn
your
hats
up
in
front
do
you
know
the
countersign
hoarsely
exasperatedly
he
bawled
at
them
serenely
and
insolently
they
rode
by
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
him
to
hell
with
the
countersign
they
hooted
laughing
at
him
we
don
t
need
any
countersign
they
ll
know
well
enough
which
side
we
re
on
when
we
begin
to
fight
for
hours
it
seemed
they
jogged
past
fading
into
the
darkness
their
horses
with
nervous
heads
turned
to
catch
the
sound
of
the
guns
the
men
with
glowing
eyes
fixed
on
the
darkness
into
battle
with
their
ancient
springfield
rifles
that
had
seen
service
for
three
years
with
their
meager
ten
rounds
of
ammunition
and
when
they
had
all
gone
the
battle
seemed
to
brighten
and
quicken
with
new
life
bloody
the
steady
noise
of
battle
filled
all
the
night
ahead
torches
danced
rails
clanged
sledges
drummed
on
the
spikes
the
men
of
the
repair
gang
shouted
in
the
frenzy
of
their
toil
it
was
after
twelve
since
the
trains
had
reached
the
beginning
of
the
torn
track
we
had
made
half
a
mile
now
and
then
a
straggler
from
the
main
body
came
down
the
line
of
trains
shuffled
into
the
light
with
his
heavy
mauser
awry
across
his
shoulders
and
faded
into
the
darkness
toward
the
debauch
of
sound
in
the
direction
of
gomez
palacio
the
soldiers
of
our
guard
squatting
about
their
little
fires
in
the
fields
relaxed
their
tense
expectancy
three
of
them
were
singing
a
little
marching
song
which
began
don
t
want
to
be
a
porfirista
don
t
want
to
be
an
orozquista
i
want
to
be
a
volunteer
in
the
army
maderista
curious
and
excited
we
hurried
up
and
down
the
trains
asking
people
what
they
knew
what
they
thought
i
had
never
heard
a
real
before
and
it
made
me
frantic
with
curiosity
and
nervousness
we
were
like
dogs
in
a
yard
when
a
is
going
on
outside
finally
the
spell
snapped
and
i
found
myself
desperately
tired
i
fell
into
a
dead
sleep
on
a
little
ledge
under
the
lip
of
the
cannon
where
the
laborers
tossed
their
wrenches
and
and
crowbars
when
the
train
moved
forward
a
hundred
feet
and
piled
on
themselves
with
shouts
and
horseplay
in
the
coldness
of
before
dawn
i
woke
with
the
colonel
s
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
can
go
now
he
said
the
sign
is
zaragosa
and
the
countersign
our
soldiers
will
be
recognized
by
their
hats
pinned
up
in
front
may
you
go
well
it
was
bitter
cold
we
threw
our
blankets
around
us
serape
fashion
and
trudged
down
past
the
fury
of
the
repair
gang
as
they
hammered
at
it
under
the
leaping
the
five
armed
men
slouching
around
their
fire
on
the
frontier
of
the
dark
are
you
off
to
the
battle
cried
one
of
the
gang
look
out
for
the
bullets
at
that
they
all
laughed
the
sentries
cried
don
t
kill
them
all
leave
a
few
for
us
beyond
the
last
torch
where
the
torn
track
was
wrenched
and
tumbled
about
on
the
uprooted
roadbed
a
shadowy
figure
waited
for
us
together
he
said
peering
at
us
in
the
dark
three
are
an
army
we
stumbled
along
over
the
broken
track
silently
just
able
to
make
him
out
with
our
eyes
he
was
a
little
dumpy
soldier
with
a
rifle
and
a
over
his
breast
he
said
that
he
had
just
brought
a
wounded
man
from
the
front
to
the
hospital
train
and
was
on
his
way
back
feel
this
he
said
holding
out
his
arm
it
was
drenched
we
could
see
nothing
blood
he
continued
unemotionally
his
blood
he
was
my
in
the
brigada
we
went
in
this
night
down
there
and
so
many
so
we
were
cut
in
half
it
was
the
first
we
had
heard
or
thought
of
wounded
men
all
of
a
sudden
we
heard
the
battle
it
had
been
going
on
steadily
all
the
time
but
we
had
sound
was
so
monstrous
so
monotonous
far
rifle
fire
came
like
the
ripping
of
strong
canvas
the
cannon
shocked
like
we
were
only
six
miles
away
now
out
of
the
darkness
loomed
a
little
knot
of
of
something
heavy
and
inert
in
a
blanket
slung
between
our
guide
threw
up
his
rifle
and
challenged
and
his
answer
was
a
retching
groan
from
the
blanket
lisped
one
of
the
bearers
huskily
where
for
the
love
of
the
virgin
is
the
hospital
train
about
a
how
can
we
water
have
you
any
water
they
stood
with
the
blanket
taut
between
them
and
something
fell
from
it
drip
drip
drip
on
the
ties
that
awful
voice
within
screamed
once
to
drink
and
fell
away
to
a
shuddering
moan
we
handed
our
canteens
to
the
silently
bestially
they
drained
them
the
wounded
man
they
forgot
then
sullen
they
pitched
on
others
appeared
singly
or
in
little
groups
they
were
simply
vague
shapes
staggering
in
the
night
like
drunkards
like
men
incredibly
tired
one
dragged
between
two
walkers
his
arms
around
their
shoulders
a
mere
boy
reeled
along
with
the
limp
body
of
his
father
on
his
back
a
horse
passed
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
two
bodies
flopping
sideways
across
the
saddle
and
a
man
walking
behind
and
beating
the
horse
on
the
rump
cursing
shrilly
he
passed
and
we
could
hear
his
falsetto
fading
dissonantly
in
the
distance
some
groaned
with
the
ugly
deadened
groan
of
uttermost
pain
one
man
slouched
in
the
saddle
of
a
mule
screamed
mechanically
every
time
the
mule
took
a
step
under
two
tall
trees
beside
an
irrigation
ditch
a
little
fire
glowed
three
sleepers
with
empty
sprawled
snoring
on
the
uneven
ground
beside
the
fire
sat
a
man
holding
with
both
hands
his
leg
straight
out
to
the
warmth
it
was
a
perfectly
good
leg
as
far
as
the
it
ended
in
a
ragged
oozing
mess
of
trousers
and
shattered
flesh
the
man
simply
sat
looking
at
it
he
didn
t
even
stir
as
we
came
near
and
yet
his
chest
rose
and
fell
with
calm
breathing
and
his
mouth
was
slightly
open
as
if
he
were
by
the
side
of
the
ditch
knelt
another
a
soft
lead
bullet
had
entered
his
hand
between
the
two
middle
fingers
and
then
spread
until
it
hollowed
out
a
bloody
cave
inside
he
had
wrapped
a
rag
around
a
little
piece
of
stick
and
was
unconcernedly
dipping
it
in
the
water
and
gouging
out
the
wound
soon
we
were
near
the
battle
in
the
east
across
the
vast
level
country
a
faint
gray
light
appeared
the
noble
alamo
trees
towering
thickly
in
massy
lines
along
the
ditches
to
the
west
burst
into
showers
of
it
was
getting
warm
and
there
came
the
tranquil
smell
of
earth
and
grass
and
growing
calm
summer
dawn
into
this
the
noise
of
battle
broke
like
something
insane
the
hysterical
chatter
of
rifle
fire
that
seemed
to
carry
a
continuous
undertone
of
when
you
listened
for
it
it
was
gone
the
nervous
deadly
of
the
machine
guns
like
some
gigantic
woodpecker
the
cannon
booming
like
great
bells
and
the
whistle
of
their
shells
and
that
most
terrible
of
all
the
sounds
of
war
shrapnel
exploding
the
great
hot
sun
swam
up
in
the
east
through
a
faint
smoke
from
the
fertile
land
and
over
the
eastern
barrens
the
began
to
wiggle
it
caught
the
startlingly
green
tops
of
the
lofty
alamos
fringing
the
ditch
that
paralleled
the
railroad
on
our
right
the
trees
ended
there
and
beyond
the
whole
rampart
of
bare
mountains
piled
range
on
range
grew
rosy
we
were
now
in
scorched
desert
again
thickly
covered
with
dusty
mesquite
except
for
another
line
of
alamos
straggling
across
from
east
to
west
close
to
the
city
there
were
no
trees
in
all
the
plain
but
two
or
three
scattered
ones
to
the
right
so
close
we
were
barely
two
miles
from
gomez
falacio
that
we
could
look
down
the
torn
track
right
into
the
town
we
could
see
the
black
round
and
back
of
that
the
roundhouse
and
across
the
track
from
them
both
the
low
adobe
walls
of
the
brittingham
corra
the
smokestacks
and
buildings
and
trees
of
la
esperanza
soap
factory
rose
clear
and
still
like
a
little
city
to
the
left
almost
directly
to
the
right
of
the
railroad
track
it
seemed
the
stark
stony
peak
of
the
cerro
de
la
pila
mounted
steeply
to
the
stone
reservoir
that
crowned
it
and
sloped
off
westward
in
a
series
of
smaller
peaks
a
spiny
ridge
a
mile
long
most
of
gomez
lay
behind
the
shoulder
of
the
cerro
and
at
its
western
end
the
villas
and
gardens
of
lerdo
made
a
vivid
patch
of
green
in
the
desert
the
great
brown
mountains
on
the
west
made
a
mighty
sweep
around
behind
the
two
cities
and
then
fell
away
south
again
in
folds
on
folds
of
gaunt
desolation
and
directly
south
from
gomez
stretched
along
the
base
of
this
range
lay
torreon
the
richest
city
of
northern
mexico
the
shooting
never
ceased
but
it
seemed
to
be
subdued
to
a
subordinate
place
in
a
fantastic
and
disordered
world
up
the
track
in
the
hot
morning
light
straggled
a
river
of
wounded
men
shattered
bleeding
bound
up
in
rotting
and
bloody
bandages
inconceivably
weary
they
passed
us
and
one
even
fell
and
lay
motionless
nearby
in
the
we
didn
t
care
soldiers
with
their
cartridges
gone
wandered
aimlessly
out
of
the
chaparral
dragging
their
rifles
and
plunged
into
the
brush
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
railroad
black
with
powder
streaked
with
sweat
their
eyes
vacantly
on
the
ground
the
thin
subtle
dust
rose
in
lazy
clouds
at
every
footstep
and
hung
there
parching
throat
and
eyes
a
little
company
of
horsemen
jogged
out
of
the
thicket
and
drew
up
on
the
track
looking
toward
town
one
man
got
down
from
his
saddle
and
squatted
beside
us
it
was
terrible
he
said
suddenly
we
went
in
there
last
night
on
foot
they
were
inside
the
with
holes
cut
in
the
iron
for
rifles
we
had
to
walk
up
and
poke
our
guns
through
the
holes
and
we
killed
them
death
trap
and
then
the
corral
they
had
two
sets
of
loopholes
one
for
the
men
kneeling
down
and
the
other
for
the
men
standing
up
three
thousand
in
they
had
five
machine
guns
to
sweep
the
road
and
the
roundhouse
with
three
rows
of
trenches
outside
and
subterranean
passages
so
they
could
crawl
under
and
shoot
us
in
the
back
our
bombs
wouldn
t
work
and
what
could
we
do
with
rifles
de
but
we
were
so
took
them
by
surprise
we
captured
the
roundhouse
and
the
and
then
this
morning
thousands
from
their
they
drove
us
back
again
they
walked
up
to
the
and
poked
their
rifles
through
the
holes
and
killed
all
of
sons
of
the
devils
we
could
see
the
place
as
he
spoke
and
hear
the
hellish
roar
and
shriek
and
yet
no
one
moved
and
there
wasn
t
a
sign
of
the
even
smoke
except
when
a
shrapnel
shell
burst
yelling
down
in
the
first
row
of
trees
a
mile
ahead
and
vomited
a
puff
of
white
the
cracking
rip
of
rifle
fire
and
the
staccato
machine
guns
and
even
the
hammering
cannon
didn
t
reveal
themselves
at
all
the
flat
dusty
plain
the
trees
and
chimneys
of
gomez
and
the
stony
hill
lay
quietly
in
the
heat
from
the
alamos
off
to
the
right
came
the
careless
song
of
birds
one
had
the
impression
that
his
senses
were
lying
it
was
an
incredible
dream
through
which
the
grotesque
procession
of
wounded
filtered
like
ghosts
in
the
dust
artillery
comes
over
to
the
right
along
the
base
of
the
line
of
trees
heavy
dust
billowed
up
men
shouted
whips
snapped
and
there
was
a
rumble
and
a
jangling
of
chains
we
plunged
into
a
little
path
that
wound
among
the
chaparral
and
emerged
upon
a
tiny
village
lost
in
the
brush
near
the
ditch
it
was
strikingly
like
a
chinese
or
central
american
village
five
or
six
adobe
huts
thatched
with
mud
and
twigs
it
was
called
san
ramon
and
there
a
little
struggling
knot
of
men
swayed
about
every
door
clamoring
for
coffee
and
and
waving
fiat
money
the
squatted
in
their
tiny
corrals
selling
at
exorbitant
prices
their
women
sweated
over
the
fire
hammering
and
pouring
villainous
black
coffee
all
around
in
the
open
spaces
lay
sleepers
like
the
dead
and
men
with
bloody
arms
and
heads
tossing
and
groaning
presently
an
officer
galloped
up
streaked
with
sweat
and
screamed
get
up
you
fools
wake
up
and
get
back
to
your
companies
we
re
going
to
attack
a
few
stirred
and
stumbled
cursing
to
their
weary
others
still
slept
de
snapped
the
officer
and
spurred
his
horse
upon
them
trampling
kicking
the
ground
boiled
men
scrambling
out
of
the
way
and
yelling
they
yawned
stretched
still
half
asleep
and
sifted
off
slowly
toward
the
front
in
an
aimless
way
the
wounded
only
dragged
themselves
listlessly
to
the
shade
of
the
brush
along
the
side
of
the
ditch
went
a
sort
of
wagon
track
and
up
this
the
constitutionalist
artillery
were
arriving
one
could
see
the
gray
heads
of
the
straining
mules
and
the
big
hats
of
their
drivers
and
the
circling
rest
was
masked
in
dust
slower
than
the
army
they
had
been
marching
all
night
past
us
rumbled
the
carriages
and
caissons
the
long
heavy
guns
yellow
with
dust
the
drivers
and
gunners
were
in
fine
good
humor
one
an
american
whose
features
were
absolutely
indistinguishable
in
the
mud
of
sweat
and
earth
shouted
to
know
if
they
were
in
time
or
if
the
town
had
fallen
i
answered
in
spanish
that
there
were
lots
of
yet
to
kill
and
a
cheer
ran
along
the
line
now
we
ll
show
them
something
cried
a
big
indian
on
a
mule
if
we
could
get
into
their
cursed
town
without
guns
what
can
we
do
with
them
the
alamos
ended
just
beyond
san
ramon
and
under
the
last
trees
villa
general
angeles
and
the
staff
sat
on
horseback
at
the
bank
of
the
ditch
beyond
that
the
ditch
ran
naked
across
the

the
town
where
it
took
water
from
the
river
villa
was
dressed
in
an
old
brown
suit
without
a
collar
and
an
ancient
felt
hat
he
was
covered
with
dirt
and
had
been
riding
up
and
down
the
lines
all
night
but
he
bore
no
trace
of
fatigue
when
he
saw
us
he
called
out
hello
well
how
do
you
like
it
fine
we
were
worn
out
and
very
dirty
the
sight
of
us
amused
him
profoundly
he
never
could
take
the
correspondents
seriously
anyway
and
it
seemed
to
him
very
droll
that
an
american
periodical
would
be
willing
to
spend
so
much
money
just
to
get
the
news
good
he
said
with
a
grin
i
m
glad
you
like
it
because
you
re
going
to
get
all
you
want
the
first
gun
had
now
come
opposite
the
staff
and
unlimbered
the
gunners
ripping
off
the
canvas
covers
and
tilting
up
the
heavy
caisson
the
captain
of
the
battery
screwed
on
the
telescopic
sight
and
the
crank
of
the
spun
the
brass
butts
of
heavy
shells
shone
in
gleaming
rows
two
men
staggered
under
the
weight
of
one
and
rested
it
on
the
ground
while
the
captain
regulated
the
shrapnel
timer
the
crashed
shut
and
we
ran
far
back
a
soaring
whistling
flew
high
after
the
shell
and
then
a
tiny
white
smoke
flowered
at
the
foot
of
the
cerro
de
la
minutes
after
a
far
detonation
about
a
hundred
yards
apart
all
along
in
front
of
the
gun
picturesque
ragged
men
stared
motionless
through
their
they
burst
into
a
chorus
of
yells
too
low
too
far
to
the
right
their
guns
are
all
along
the
ridge
time
it
about
fifteen
seconds
later
down
front
the
rifle
fire
had
frittered
away
to
ragged
sputtering
and
the
machine
guns
were
silent
everybody
was
watching
the
artillery
duel
it
was
about
in
the
morning
and
already
very
hot
in
the
fields
behind
sounded
the
parched
chirp
of
crickets
the
lofty
fresh
tops
of
the
alamos
rustled
in
a
high
languid
breeze
birds
began
to
sing
again
another
gun
wheeled
into
line
and
the
of
the
first
clacked
again
there
came
the
snap
of
the
trigger
but
no
roar
the
gunners
wrenched
open
the
breech
and
hurled
the
smoking
brass
projectile
on
the
grass
bad
shell
i
saw
general
angeles
in
his
faded
brown
sweater
hatless
peering
through
the
sight
and
cranking
up
the
range
villa
was
spurring
his
reluctant
horse
up
to
the
caisson
the
other
gun
this
time
we
saw
the
shell
burst
higher
up
the
stony
hill
this
time
and
then
four
booms
floated
to
us
and
simultaneously
the
enemy
s
shells
which
had
been
exploding
desultorily
over
the
line
of
trees
nearest
the
city
marched
out
into
the
open
desert
and
leaped
toward
us
in
four
tremendous
explosions
each
nearer
more
guns
had
wheeled
into
line
others
filed
off
to
the
right
along
a
diagonal
of
trees
and
a
long
line
of
heavy
trucks
plunging
mules
and
cursing
shouting
men
choked
up
the
dusty
road
to
the
rear
the
unlimbered
mules
jingled
back
and
the
drivers
threw
themselves
exhausted
under
the
nearest
chaparral
the
federal
shrapnel
well
fired
and
excellently
timed
was
bursting
now
only
a
few
hundred
yards
in
front
of
our
line
and
the
minute
boom
of
their
guns
was
almost
incessant
over
our
heads
snapping
viciously
in
the
leafy
trees
sang
the
rain
of
lead
our
guns
replied
spasmodically
the
shells
fashioned
on
converted
mining
machinery
in
chihuahua
were
not
reliable
galloped
past
stout
captain
marinelli
the
italian
soldier
of
fortune
steering
as
near
the
newspapermen
as
possible
with
a
serious
napoleonic
look
on
his
face
he
glanced
once
or
twice
at
the
camera
man
smiling
graciously
but
the
latter
coldly
looked
away
with
a
workmanlike
flourish
he
ordered
the
wheeling
of
his
gun
into
position
and
sighted
it
himself
just
then
a
shell
burst
deafeningly
about
a
hundred
yards
in
front
the
federals
were
getting
the
range
marinelli
bounded
away
from
his
cannon
mounted
his
horse
limbered
up
and
came
galloping
dramatically
back
with
his
gun
rumbling
along
at
a
dead
run
behind
none
of
the
other
guns
had
retreated
puffing
up
his
foaming
charger
in
front
of
the
camera
man
he
flung
himself
to
the
ground
and
took
a
position
now
he
said
you
can
take
my
picture
go
to
hell
said
the
camera
man
and
a
great
shout
of
laughter
went
up
along
the
line
the
high
cracked
note
of
a
bugle
thrilled
through
the
racking
roar
immediately
mules
dragging
their
jangling
limbers
appeared
and
shouting
men
the
caissons
snapped
shut
going
down
front
shouted
colonel
servin
not
hitting
too
far
away
here
and
the
line
snapped
taut
and
wound
out
into
the
open
desert
under
the
bursting
shells
we
returned
along
the
winding
path
through
the
mesquite
crossed
the
track
and
struck
out
across
the
dusty
plain
southeastward
looking
back
along
the
railroad
i
could
see
smoke
and
the
round
front
of
the
first
train
miles
away
and
in
front
of
it
throngs
of
active
little
dots
swarming
on
the
right
of
way
distorted
like
things
seen
in
a
wavy
mirror
we
strode
along
in
a
haze
of
thin
dust
the
giant
mesquite
dwindled
until
it
scarcely
reached
to
our
knees
to
the
right
the
tall
hill
and
the
chimneys
of
the
town
swam
tranquilly
in
the
hot
sun
rifle
fire
had
almost
ceased
for
the
moment
and
only
dazzling
bursts
of
thick
white
smoke
marked
our
occasional
shells
along
the
ridge
we
could
see
our
drab
guns
rocking
down
the
plain
spreading
along
the
first
line
of
alamos
where
the
searching
fingers
of
the
enemy
s
shrapnel
probed
continually
little
bodies
of
horsemen
moved
here
and
there
over
the
desert
and
stragglers
on
foot
trailing
their
rifles
an
old
peon
stooped
with
age
and
dressed
in
rags
crouched
in
the
low
shrub
gathering
mesquite
twigs
say
friend
we
asked
him
is
there
any
way
we
can
get
in
close
to
see
the
fighting
he
straightened
up
and
stared
at
us
if
you
had
been
here
as
long
as
i
have
said
he
you
wouldn
t
care
about
seeing
the
fighting
i
have
seen
them
take
torreon
seven
times
in
three
years
sometimes
they
attack
from
gomez
palacio
and
sometimes
from
the
mountains
but
it
is
always
the
there
is
something
interesting
in
it
for
the
young
but
for
us
old
people
we
are
tired
of
war
he
paused
and
stared
out
over
the
plain
do
you
see
this
dry
ditch
well
if
you
will
get
down
in
it
and
follow
along
it
will
lead
you
into
the
town
and
then
as
an
afterthought
he
added
incuriously
what
party
do
you
belong
to
the
constitutionalists
so
first
it
was
the
maderistas
and
then
the
orozquistas
and
now
did
you
call
them
i
am
very
old
and
i
have
not
long
to
live
but
this
teems
to
me
that
all
it
accomplishes
is
to
let
us
go
hungry
go
with
god
señores
and
he
bent
again
to
his
slow
task
while
we
descended
into
the
arroyo
it
was
a
disused
irrigation
ditch
running
a
little
south
of
west
its
bottom
covered
with
dusty
weeds
and
the
end
of
its
straight
length
hidden
from
us
by
a
sort
of
mirage
that
looked
like
a
glaring
pool
of
water
stooped
a
little
so
as
to
be
hidden
from
the
outside
we
walked
along
it
seemed
for
hours
the
cracked
bottom
and
dusty
sides
of
the
ditch
reflecting
the
fierce
heat
upon
us
until
we
were
faint
with
it
once
horsemen
passed
quite
near
on
our
right
their
big
iron
spurs
ringing
we
crouched
down
until
they
passed
for
we
didn
t
want
to
take
any
chances
down
in
the
ditch
the
artillery
fire
sounded
very
faint
and
far
away
but
once
i
cautiously
lifted
my
head
above
the
bank
and
discovered
that
we
were
very
near
the
first
line
of
trees
shells
were
bursting
along
it
and
i
could
even
see
the
belch
of
furious
haze
hurling
out
from
the
mouths
of
our
cannon
and
feel
the
surf
of
hit
me
like
a
blow
when
they
fired
we
were
a
good
quarter
of
a
mile
in
front
of
our
artillery
and
evidently
making
for
the
on
the
very
edge
of
the
town
as
we
stooped
again
the
shells
passing
overhead
whined
sharply
and
suddenly
across
the
arc
of
sky
and
were
cut
off
abruptly
until
the
sullen
echoless
booff
of
their
explosion
there
ahead
where
the
railroad
trestle
of
the
main
line
crossed
the
arroyo
huddled
a
little
pile
of
left
from
the
first
attack
hardly
one
was
bloody
their
heads
and
hearts
were
pierced
with
the
clean
tiny
holes
of
steel
mauser
bullets
they
lay
limply
with
the
unearthly
calm
lean
faces
of
the
dead
someone
perhaps
their
own
thrifty
had
stripped
them
of
arms
shoes
hats
and
serviceable
clothing
one
sleeping
soldier
squatting
on
the
edge
of
the
heap
with
his
rifle
across
his
knees
snored
deeply
flies
covered
dead
hummed
with
them
but
the
sun
had
not
yet
affected
them
another
soldier
leaned
against
the
townward
bank
of
the
ditch
his
feet
resting
on
a
corpse
banging
methodically
away
at
something
he
saw
under
the
shadow
of
the
trestle
four
men
sat
playing
cards
they
played
listlessly
without
talking
their
eyes
red
with
lack
of
sleep
the
heat
was
frightful
occasionally
a
stray
bullet
came
by
screaming
this
strange
company
took
our
appearance
as
a
matter
of
course
the
sharpshooter
doubled
up
out
of
range
and
carefully
put
another
in
his
rifle
you
haven
t
got
another
drop
of
water
in
that
canteen
have
you
he
asked
we
haven
t
eaten
or
drunk
since
yesterday
he
guzzled
the
water
furtively
watching
the
card
players
lest
they
too
should
be
thirsty
they
say
that
we
are
to
attack
the
and
the
corral
again
when
the
artillery
is
in
position
to
support
us
but
it
was
in
the
night
they
slaughtered
us
in
the
streets
there
he
wiped
his
mouth
on
the
back
of
his
hand
and
began
firing
again
we
lay
beside
him
and
looked
over
we
were
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
deadly
across
the
track
and
the
wide
street
beyond
lay
the
brown
of
the
brittingham
corral
innocent
looking
enough
now
with
only
black
dots
to
show
the
double
line
of
there
are
the
machine
guns
said
our
friend
see
them
those
slim
barrels
peeping
over
the
edge
we
couldn
t
make
them
out
corral
and
town
lay
sleeping
in
the
beat
dust
hovered
still
in
the
air
making
a
thin
haze
about
fifty
yards
in
front
of
us
was
a
shallow
exposed
ditch
evidently
once
a
federal
trench
for
the
dirt
had
been
piled
on
our
side
two
hundred
drab
dusty
soldiers
lay
in
it
now
facing
constitutionalist
infantry
they
were
sprawled
on
the
ground
in
all
attitudes
of
weariness
some
sleeping
on
their
backs
facing
up
to
the
hot
sun
others
wearily
transferring
the
dirt
with
their
scooped
hands
from
rear
to
front
before
them
they
had
piled
up
irregular
heaps
of
rocks
now
infantry
in
the
constitutionalist
army
is
simply
cavalry
without
horses
all
villa
s
soldiers
are
mounted
except
the
artillery
and
those
for
whom
horses
can
not
be
procured
of
a
sudden
the
artillery
in
our
rear
boomed
all
together
and
over
our
heads
a
dozen
shells
screamed
toward
the
cerro
that
is
the
signal
said
the
man
at
our
side
he
clambered
down
into
the
ditch
and
kicked
the
sleeper
come
on
he
yelled
wake
up
we
re
going
to
attack
the
the
snorer
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
slowly
he
yawned
and
picked
up
his
rifle
without
a
word
the
card
players
began
to
squabble
about
their
winnings
a
violent
dispute
broke
out
as
to
who
owned
the
pack
of
cards
grumbling
and
still
arguing
they
stumbled
out
and
followed
the
sharpshooter
up
over
the
edge
of
the
ditch
rifle
fire
rang
along
the
edge
of
the
trench
in
front
the
sleepers
flopped
over
on
their
stomachs
behind
their
little
elbows
worked
vigorously
pumping
the
guns
the
hollow
steel
resounded
to
the
rain
of
thumping
bullets
chips
of
adobe
flew
from
the
wall
of
the
corral
instantly
the
wall
bristled
with
shining
barrels
and
the
two
awoke
crackling
with
hidden
vicious
firing
bullets
roofed
the
heavens
with
whistling
the
smoking
dust
up
until
a
yellow
curtain
of
whirling
cloud
veiled
us
from
the
houses
and
the
tank
we
could
see
our
friend
running
low
along
the
ground
the
sleepy
man
following
standing
erect
still
rubbing
his
eyes
behind
strung
out
the
gamblers
squabbling
yet
somewhere
in
the
rear
a
bugle
blew
the
sharpshooter
running
in
front
stopped
suddenly
swaying
as
if
he
had
run
against
a
solid
wall
his
left
leg
doubled
under
him
and
he
sank
crazily
to
one
knee
in
the
exposed
flat
whipping
up
his
rifle
with
a
yell
the
dirty
monkeys
he
screamed
firing
rapidly
into
the
dust
i
ll
show
the
the
cropped
heads
the
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
like
a
dog
with
a
hurt
ear
blood
drops
flew
from
it
bellowing
with
rage
he
shot
the
rest
of
his
clip
and
then
slumped
to
the
ground
and
thrashed
to
and
fro
for
a
minute
the
others
passed
him
with
scarcely
a
look
now
the
trench
was
boiling
with
men
scrambling
to
their
feet
like
worms
when
you
turn
over
a
log
the
rifle
fire
rattled
shrilly
from
behind
us
came
running
feet
and
men
in
sandals
with
blankets
over
their
shoulders
came
falling
and
slipping
down
the
ditch
and
scrambling
up
the
other
of
them
it
seemed
they
almost
hid
from
us
the
front
but
through
the
dust
and
the
spaces
between
running
logs
we
could
see
the
soldiers
in
the
trench
leap
their
barricade
like
a
breaking
wave
and
then
the
impenetrable
dust
shut
down
and
the
fierce
stabbing
needle
of
the
machine
guns
sewed
the
mighty
jumble
of
sounds
together
a
glimpse
through
a
rift
in
the
cloud
torn
by
a
sudden
hot
gust
of
could
see
the
first
brown
line
of
men
reeling
altogether
like
drunkards
and
the
machine
guns
over
the
wall
spitting
sharp
dull
red
in
the
sunshine
then
a
man
came
running
back
out
of
it
the
sweat
streaming
down
his
face
without
a
gun
he
ran
fast
half
sliding
half
falling
down
into
our
ditch
and
up
the
other
side
other
dim
forms
loomed
up
in
the
dust
ahead
what
is
it
how
is
it
going
i
cried
he
answered
nothing
but
ran
on
suddenly
and
terribly
the
monstrous
crash
and
scream
of
shrapnel
burst
from
the
turmoil
ahead
the
enemy
s
artillery
mechanically
i
listened
for
our
guns
except
for
an
occasional
boom
they
were
silent
our
shells
were
failing
again
two
more
shrapnel
shells
out
of
the
men
came
running
in
pairs
in
groups
a
stampeding
mob
they
fell
over
us
around
us
in
a
human
flood
shouting
to
the
alamos
to
the
trains
the
federation
is
coming
we
struggled
up
among
them
and
ran
too
straight
up
the
railroad
track
behind
us
roared
the
shells
searching
in
the
dust
and
the
tearing
musketry
and
then
we
noticed
that
all
the
wide
roadway
ahead
was
filled
with
galloping
horsemen
yelling
shrill
indian
cries
and
waving
their
main
column
we
stood
to
one
side
as
they
whirled
past
about
five
hundred
of
them
stoop
in
their
saddles
and
begin
to
shoot
the
drumming
of
their
horses
hoofs
was
like
thunder
better
not
go
in
there
it
s
too
hot
cried
one
of
the
infantry
with
a
grin
well
i
ll
bet
i
m
hotter
answered
a
horseman
and
we
all
laughed
we
walked
tranquilly
back
along
the
railroad
track
while
the
firing
behind
wound
up
to
a
continuous
roar
a
group
of
tall
sombreros
blankets
and
white
cotton
blouses
stood
along
here
with
folded
arms
looking
down
the
track
toward
town
look
out
there
friends
joshed
a
soldier
don
t
stand
there
you
ll
get
hit
the
peons
looked
at
each
other
and
grinned
feebly
but
señor
said
one
this
is
where
we
always
stand
when
there
is
a
battle
a
little
farther
along
i
came
upon
an
along
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
i
can
not
ride
him
any
more
he
said
to
me
earnestly
he
is
quite
too
tired
i
am
afraid
he
will
die
if
he
does
not
sleep
the
horse
a
big
chestnut
stallion
stumbled
and
swayed
as
he
walked
enormous
tears
trickled
from
his
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
nose
i
was
dead
tired
reeling
from
lack
of
sleep
and
food
and
the
terrible
heat
of
the
sun
about
half
a
mile
out
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
enemy
s
shrapnel
poking
into
the
line
of
trees
more
frequently
than
ever
they
seemed
to
have
thoroughly
got
the
range
and
just
then
i
saw
the
gray
line
of
guns
limbered
to
their
mules
begin
to
crawl
out
from
the
trees
toward
the
rear
at
four
or
five
different
points
our
artillery
had
been
shelled
out
of
their
positions
i
threw
myself
down
to
rest
in
the
shade
of
a
big
mesquite
bush
almost
immediately
a
change
seemed
to
come
in
the
sound
of
the
rifle
fire
as
if
half
of
it
had
been
suddenly
cut
off
at
the
same
time
twenty
bugles
shrilled
rising
i
noticed
a
line
of
running
horsemen
fleeing
up
the
track
shouting
something
more
followed
galloping
at
the
place
where
the
railroad
passed
beyond
the
trees
on
its
way
into
town
the
cavalry
had
been
repulsed
all
at
once
the
whole
plain
squirmed
with
men
mounted
and
on
foot
all
running
rearward
one
man
threw
away
his
blanket
another
his
rifle
they
thickened
over
the
hot
desert
stamping
up
the
dust
until
the
flat
was
crowded
with
them
right
in
front
of
me
a
horseman
burst
out
of
the
brush
shouting
the
federals
are
coming
to
the
trains
they
are
right
behind
the
entire
constitutionalist
army
was
routed
i
caught
up
my
blanket
and
took
to
my
heels
a
little
way
farther
on
i
came
upon
a
cannon
abandoned
in
the
desert
traces
cut
mules
gone
underfoot
were
guns
and
dozens
of
serapes
it
was
a
rout
coming
to
an
open
space
i
saw
ahead
a
large
crowd
of
fleeing
soldiers
without
rifles
suddenly
three
men
on
horseback
swept
across
in
front
of
them
waving
their
arms
and
yelling
go
back
they
cried
they
aren
t
coming
out
go
back
for
the
love
of
god
two
i
didn
t
recognize
the
other
was
villa
about
a
mile
back
the
flight
was
stopped
i
met
the
soldiers
coming
back
with
the
relieved
expression
of
men
who
have
feared
an
unknown
danger
and
been
suddenly
set
free
from
it
that
was
always
villa
s
could
explain
things
to
the
great
mass
of
ordinary
people
in
a
way
that
they
immediately
understood
the
federals
as
usual
had
failed
to
take
advantage
of
their
opportunity
to
inflict
a
lasting
defeat
upon
the
constitutionalists
perhaps
they
feared
an
ambush
like
the
one
villa
had
arranged
at
mapula
when
the
victorious
federals
sallied
out
to
pursue
villa
s
fleeing
army
after
the
first
attack
on
chihuahua
and
were
repulsed
with
heavy
slaughter
anyway
they
did
not
come
out
the
men
came
straggling
back
hunting
in
the
mesquite
for
their
guns
and
blankets
and
for
other
people
s
guns
and
blankets
you
could
hear
them
shouting
and
joking
all
over
the
plain
where
are
you
going
with
that
rifle
that
s
my
i
dropped
my
serape
right
here
by
this
bush
and
now
it
s
gone
o
juan
cried
one
man
to
another
i
always
told
you
i
could
beat
you
running
but
you
didn
t
i
was
a
hundred
meters
ahead
flying
through
the
air
like
a
cannon
ball
the
truth
was
that
after
riding
twelve
hours
the
day
before
fighting
all
night
and
all
morning
in
the
blazing
sun
under
the
frightful
strain
of
charging
an
intrenched
force
in
the
face
of
artillery
and
machine
guns
without
food
water
or
sleep
the
army
s
nerve
had
suddenly
given
way
but
from
the
time
that
they
returned
after
the
flight
the
ultimate
result
was
never
in
doubt
the
psychological
crisis
was
past
now
the
rifle
fire
had
altogether
ceased
and
even
cannon
shots
from
the
enemy
were
few
and
far
between
at
the
ditch
under
the
first
line
of
trees
our
men
entrenched
themselves
the
artillery
had
withdrawn
to
the
second
line
of
mile
back
and
under
the
grateful
shade
the
men
threw
themselves
heavily
down
and
slept
the
strain
had
snapped
as
the
sun
rose
toward
noon
the
desert
hill
and
town
throbbed
silently
in
the
intense
heat
sometimes
an
exchange
of
shots
far
to
the
right
or
left
told
where
the
outposts
were
exchanging
compliments
but
even
that
soon
stopped
in
the
cotton
and
cornfields
to
the
north
among
the
sprouting
green
things
insects
chirped
the
birds
sang
no
more
because
of
the
heat
it
was
breathless
the
leaves
stirred
in
no
wind
here
and
there
little
fires
smoked
where
the
soldiers
rolled
from
the
scanty
flour
they
had
brought
in
their
those
who
didn
t
have
any
swarmed
around
begging
a
crumb
everybody
simply
and
generously
divided
the
food
i
was
hailed
from
a
dozen
fires
with
hey
have
you
breakfasted
here
is
a
piece
of
my
come
and
eat
rows
of
men
lay
flat
on
their
stomachs
along
the
irrigation
ditch
scooping
up
the
dirty
water
in
their
palms
three
or
four
miles
back
we
could
see
the
and
the
first
two
trains
opposite
the
big
ranch
of
el
verjel
with
the
tireless
repair
gang
hard
at
it
in
the
hot
sun
the
provision
train
had
not
come
up
yet
little
colonel
servin
came
by
perched
on
an
immense
bay
horse
still
dapper
and
fresh
after
the
terrible
work
of
the
night
i
don
t
know
what
we
shall
do
yet
he
said
only
the
general
knows
that
and
he
never
tells
but
we
shall
not
assault
again
until
the
brigada
zaragosa
returns
benavides
has
had
a
hard
battle
over
there
at
hundred
and
fifty
of
ours
killed
they
say
and
the
general
has
sent
for
general
robles
and
general
contreras
who
have
been
attacking
from
the
south
to
bring
up
all
their
men
and
join
him
here
they
say
though
that
we
are
going
to
deliver
a
night
attack
next
so
that
their
artillery
won
t
be
effective
he
galloped
on
about
midday
thin
columns
of
sluggish
dirty
smoke
began
to
rise
from
several
points
in
the
town
and
toward
afternoon
a
slow
hot
wind
brought
to
us
the
faintly
sickening
smell
of
crude
oil
mingled
with
scorched
human
flesh
the
federals
were
burning
piles
of
the
dead
we
walked
back
to
the
trains
and
stormed
general
benavides
private
car
in
the
brigada
zaragosa
train
the
major
in
charge
had
them
cook
us
something
to
eat
in
the
general
s
kitchen
we
ate
ravenously
and
afterward
went
over
along
the
line
of
trees
and
slept
for
hours
late
in
the
afternoon
we
started
once
more
for
the
front
hundreds
of
soldiers
and
peons
of
the
neighborhood
ravenously
hungry
prowled
around
the
trains
hoping
to
pick
up
discarded
food
or
slops
or
anything
at
all
to
eat
they
were
ashamed
of
themselves
however
and
affected
a
sauntering
indolence
when
we
passed
i
remember
that
we
sat
for
a
while
talking
with
some
soldiers
on
the
top
of
a
when
a
boy
with
and
lugging
a
huge
rifle
came
past
beneath
his
eyes
searching
the
ground
a
stale
half
rotting
crunched
into
the
dirt
by
many
passing
feet
caught
his
attention
he
pounced
upon
it
and
bit
a
piece
out
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
us
as
if
i
were
dying
of
hunger
he
said
scornfully
and
tossed
it
away
with
contempt
down
in
the
shade
of
the
alamos
across
the
ditch
from
san
ramon
the
canadian
captain
treston
was
bivouacked
with
his
machine
gun
battery
the
guns
and
their
heavy
tripods
were
unloaded
from
the
mules
and
all
around
lay
the
unlimbered
their
animals
grazing
in
the
rich
green
fields
the
men
squatted
around
their
fires
or
lying
stretched
out
on
the
bank
of
the
ditch
treston
waved
an
ashy
he
was
munching
and
bawled
say
reed
please
come
here
and
interpret
for
me
i
can
t
find
my
interpreters
and
if
we
go
into
action
i
ll
be
in
a
hell
of
a
fix
you
see
i
don
t
know
the
damn
language
and
when
i
came
down
here
villa
hired
two
interpreters
to
go
around
with
me
all
the
time
and
i
can
t
ever
find
the
they
always
go
off
and
leave
me
in
a
hole
i
took
part
of
the
proffered
delicacy
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
there
was
any
chance
of
going
into
action
i
think
we
ll
go
in
as
soon
as
it
s
dark
he
answered
do
you
want
to
go
along
with
the
machine
guns
and
interpret
i
said
i
did
a
ragged
man
near
the
fire
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
rose
and
came
across
smiling
i
thought
when
i
looked
at
you
that
you
seemed
to
be
an
hombre
who
hadn
t
tasted
tobacco
for
a
while
will
you
take
half
my
cigarette
before
i
could
protest
he
produced
a
brown
cigarette
and
tore
it
across
in
two
pieces
the
sun
went
gloriously
down
behind
the
notched
purple
mountains
in
front
of
us
and
for
a
minute
a
clear
fan
of
quivering
light
poured
up
the
high
arc
of
stainless
sky
the
birds
awoke
in
the
trees
leaves
rustled
the
fertile
land
exhaled
a
pearly
mist
a
dozen
ragged
soldiers
lying
close
together
began
to
improvise
the
air
and
words
of
a
song
about
the
battle
of
new
ballad
was
being
born
other
singing
came
to
us
through
the
still
cool
dusk
i
felt
my
whole
feeling
going
out
to
these
gentle
simple
lovable
they
were
it
was
just
after
i
had
been
to
the
ditch
for
a
drink
that
treston
said
casually
by
the
way
one
of
our
men
found
this
floating
in
the
ditch
a
little
while
ago
i
can
t
read
spanish
so
i
didn
t
know
what
the
word
meant
you
see
the
water
from
these
ditches
all
comes
from
the
river
inside
the
town
so
i
thought
it
might
be
a
federal
paper
i
took
it
from
his
hand
it
was
a
little
folded
white
piece
of
wet
paper
like
the
corner
and
front
of
a
package
in
large
black
letters
was
printed
on
the
front
and
in
smaller
type
arsenic
beware
poison
look
here
i
demanded
sitting
up
suddenly
have
there
been
any
sick
people
around
here
this
evening
that
s
funny
you
re
asking
he
said
a
good
many
of
the
men
have
had
bad
cramps
in
the
stomach
and
i
don
t
feel
altogether
well
just
before
you
came
a
mule
suddenly
keeled
over
and
died
in
that
next
field
and
a
horse
across
the
ditch
fatigue
or
sunstroke
probably
fortunately
the
ditch
carried
a
large
body
of
swiftly
running
water
so
the
danger
was
not
great
i
explained
to
him
that
the
federals
had
poisoned
the
ditch
my
god
said
treston
perhaps
that
is
what
they
were
trying
to
tell
me
about
twenty
people
have
come
up
to
me
and
said
something
about
what
does
that
mean
that
s
what
it
means
i
answered
where
can
we
get
about
a
quart
of
strong
coffee
we
found
a
great
can
of
it
at
the
nearest
fire
and
felt
better
o
yes
we
knew
said
the
men
that
is
why
we
watered
the
animals
at
the
other
ditch
we
heard
long
ago
they
say
that
ten
horses
are
dead
down
in
front
and
that
many
men
are
rolling
very
sick
on
the
ground
an
officer
on
horseback
rode
by
shouting
that
we
were
all
to
go
back
to
el
verjel
and
camp
there
beside
the
trains
for
the
night
that
the
general
had
said
that
everyone
but
the
advance
guards
were
to
get
a
good
night
s
sleep
out
of
the
zone
of
fire
and
that
the
commissary
train
had
come
up
and
was
just
behind
the
hospital
train
bugles
sounded
and
the
men
struggled
up
off
the
ground
catching
mules
fastening
their
harness
on
amid
shouting
and
braying
and
jingling
saddling
horses
and
limbering
guns
treston
got
on
his
pony
and
i
walked
along
beside
him
so
there
was
to
be
no
night
attack
then
it
was
now
almost
dark
across
the
ditch
we
fell
in
with
the
shadowy
forms
of
a
company
of
soldiers
trotting
northward
all
muffling
blankets
and
big
hats
and
ringing
spurs
they
hailed
me
hey
where
s
your
horse
i
admitted
i
had
none
jump
up
behind
me
then
chimed
in
five
or
six
altogether
one
pulled
up
right
beside
me
and
i
mounted
with
him
we
jogged
on
through
the
mesquite
and
across
a
dim
lovely
field
someone
began
to
sing
and
two
more
joined
in
a
round
full
moon
bubbled
up
in
the
clear
night
how
do
you
say
in
english
asked
my
horseman
i
told
him
and
for
days
after
entire
strangers
would
stop
me
and
ask
me
with
roars
of
laughter
how
the
americans
said
around
the
ranch
of
el
verjel
the
army
was
encamped
we
rode
into
a
field
dotted
with
fires
where
aimless
soldiers
wandered
around
in
the
dark
shouting
to
know
where
the
brigada
was
or
josé
rodriguez
s
or
the
townward
the
artillery
was
unlimbering
in
a
wide
alert
guns
pointing
south
to
the
east
the
camp
of
benavides
brigada
zaragosa
just
arrived
from
sacramento
made
an
immense
glow
in
the
sky
from
the
direction
of
the
provision
train
a
long
file
of
men
bore
sacks
of
flour
coffee
and
packages
of
cigarettes
a
hundred
different
singing
choruses
swelled
up
into
the
night
it
comes
to
my
mind
with
particular
vividness
how
i
saw
a
poor
poisoned
horse
suddenly
double
up
and
fall
thrashing
how
we
passed
a
man
bent
to
the
ground
in
the
darkness
vomiting
violently
how
after
i
had
rolled
up
on
the
ground
in
my
blankets
terrible
cramps
suddenly
wrenched
me
and
i
crawled
out
a
way
into
the
brush
and
didn
t
have
the
strength
to
crawl
back
in
fact
until
gray
dawn
i
rolled
very
sick
on
the
ground
outpost
in
tuesday
early
in
the
morning
the
army
was
in
motion
again
toward
the
front
straggling
down
the
track
and
across
the
field
four
hundred
raging
demons
sweated
and
hammered
at
the
ruined
track
the
foremost
train
had
made
half
a
mile
in
the
night
horses
were
plenty
that
morning
and
i
bought
one
saddle
and
all
for
fifteen
dollars
in
gold
trotting
down
by
san
ramon
i
fell
in
with
two
horsemen
in
high
sombreros
with
little
printed
pictures
of
our
lady
of
guadelupe
sewed
on
the
crowns
they
said
they
were
going
out
to
an
outpost
upon
the
extreme
right
wing
near
the
mountains
above
lerdo
where
their
company
was
posted
to
hold
a
hill
why
should
i
want
to
come
with
them
who
was
i
anyway
i
showed
them
my
pass
signed
by
francisco
villa
they
were
still
hostile
francisco
villa
is
nothing
to
us
they
said
and
how
do
we
know
whether
this
is
his
name
written
by
him
we
are
of
the
brigada
juarez
calixto
contreras
but
after
a
short
consultation
the
taller
grunted
come
we
left
the
protection
of
the
trees
striking
out
diagonally
across
the
ramparted
due
west
straight
for
a
steep
high
hill
that
already
quivered
in
the
heat
between
us
and
the
suburbs
of
gomez
palacio
stretched
a
barren
flat
plain
covered
with
low
mesquite
and
cut
by
dry
irrigation
ditches
the
cerro
de
la
pila
with
its
murderous
concealed
artillery
lay
perfectly
quiet
except
that
up
one
side
of
it
so
clear
was
the
air
we
could
make
out
a
little
knot
of
figures
dragging
what
looked
like
a
cannon
just
outside
of
the
nearest
houses
some
horsemen
were
riding
around
we
immediately
struck
north
making
a
wide
detour
carefully
on
the
watch
for
this
intermediate
ground
was
overrun
by
pickets
and
scouting
parties
about
a
mile
beyond
almost
along
the
foot
of
the
hill
ran
the
high
road
from
the
north
to
lerdo
we
reconnoitered
this
carefully
from
the
brush
a
peasant
passed
whistling
driving
a
flock
of
goats
on
the
very
edge
of
this
road
under
a
bush
was
an
earthen
jar
full
of
milk
without
the
least
hesitation
the
first
soldier
drew
his
revolver
and
shot
the
jar
split
into
a
hundred
spurting
everywhere
poisoned
he
said
briefly
the
first
company
stationed
over
here
drank
some
of
that
stuff
four
died
we
rode
on
up
on
the
hill
crest
a
few
black
figures
squatted
their
rifles
tilted
against
their
knees
my
companions
waved
to
them
and
we
turned
north
along
the
bank
of
a
little
river
that
unrolled
a
narrow
strip
of
green
grass
in
the
midst
of
desolation
the
outpost
was
camped
on
both
sides
of
the
water
in
a
sort
of
meadow
i
asked
where
the
colonel
was
and
finally
found
him
stretched
out
in
the
shade
of
a
tent
that
he
had
made
by
hanging
his
serape
over
a
bush
get
down
from
your
horse
friend
he
said
i
am
glad
to
welcome
you
here
my
house
pointing
quizzically
to
the
roof
of
his
tent
is
at
your
disposal
here
are
cigarettes
there
is
meat
cooking
on
the
fire
upon
the
meadow
fully
saddled
grazed
the
horses
of
the
troop
about
fifty
of
them
the
men
sprawled
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
the
mesquite
chatting
and
playing
cards
this
was
a
different
breed
of
men
from
the
comparatively
disciplined
troops
of
villa
s
army
they
were
simply
peons
who
had
risen
in
arms
like
my
friends
of
la
tough
happy
race
of
mountaineers
and
cowboys
among
whom
were
many
who
had
been
bandits
in
the
old
days
unpaid
officers
merely
the
bravest
among
only
with
aged
springfields
and
a
handful
of
cartridges
apiece
they
had
fought
almost
continuously
for
three
years
for
four
months
they
and
the
irregular
troops
of
such
guerrilla
chiefs
as
urbina
and
robles
had
held
the
advance
around
torreon
fighting
almost
daily
with
federal
outposts
and
suffering
all
the
hardships
of
the
campaign
while
the
main
army
garrisoned
chihuahua
and
juarez
these
ragged
men
were
the
bravest
soldiers
in
villa
s
army
i
had
lain
there
about
fifteen
minutes
watching
the
beef
sizzle
in
the
flames
and
satisfying
the
eager
curiosity
of
a
crowd
as
to
my
curious
profession
when
there
was
a
sound
of
galloping
and
a
voice
they
re
coming
out
of
lerdo
to
horse
half
a
hundred
men
reluctantly
and
in
a
leisurely
manner
made
for
their
horses
the
colonel
rose
yawning
he
stretched
the
animals
of
federals
he
growled
they
stay
on
our
minds
all
the
time
you
never
have
time
to
think
of
more
pleasant
things
it
s
a
shame
they
won
t
let
us
even
eat
our
dinner
we
were
mounted
soon
trotting
down
the
bank
of
the
stream
far
in
front
sounded
the
rifles
instinctively
without
order
we
broke
into
a
gallop
through
the
streets
of
a
little
village
where
the
stood
on
the
roofs
of
their
houses
looking
off
to
the
south
little
bundles
of
their
belongings
beside
them
so
they
could
flee
if
the
battle
went
against
us
for
the
federals
cruelly
punish
villages
which
have
harbored
the
enemy
beyond
lay
the
stony
little
hill
we
got
off
our
horses
and
throwing
the
reins
over
their
heads
climbed
on
foot
about
a
dozen
men
already
lay
there
shooting
spasmodically
in
the
direction
of
the
green
bank
of
trees
behind
which
lay
lerdo
unseen
scattering
shots
ripped
from
the
blank
desert
between
about
half
a
mile
away
small
brown
figures
dodged
around
in
the
brush
a
thin
showed
where
another
detachment
was
marching
slowly
north
in
their
rear
we
already
got
one
sure
and
another
one
in
the
leg
said
a
soldier
spitting
how
many
do
you
make
them
out
asked
the
colonel
about
two
hundred
the
colonel
stood
bolt
upright
carelessly
looking
out
over
the
sunny
plain
immediately
a
roll
of
shots
swept
along
their
front
a
bullet
chirped
overhead
already
the
men
had
gone
to
work
unordered
each
soldier
picked
out
a
smooth
place
to
lie
and
piled
up
a
little
heap
of
stones
in
front
to
shield
him
they
lay
down
grunting
loosening
their
belts
and
taking
off
their
coats
to
be
perfectly
comfortable
then
they
began
slowly
and
methodically
to
shoot
there
goes
another
announced
the
colonel
yours
pedro
not
pedro
s
at
all
interrupted
another
man
fretfully
i
got
him
o
the
devil
you
did
snapped
pedro
they
quarreled
the
firing
from
the
desert
was
now
pretty
general
and
we
could
see
the
federals
slipping
toward
us
under
the
protection
of
every
bush
and
arroyo
our
men
fired
slowly
and
carefully
aiming
a
long
time
before
they
pulled
the
trigger
for
the
months
with
scanty
ammunition
around
torreon
had
made
them
economical
but
now
every
hill
and
bush
along
our
line
held
a
little
knot
of
sharpshooters
and
looking
back
on
the
wide
flats
and
fields
between
the
hill
and
the
railroad
i
saw
innumerable
single
horsemen
and
squads
of
them
spurring
through
the
brush
in
ten
minutes
we
would
have
five
hundred
men
with
us
the
rifle
fire
along
the
line
swelled
and
deepened
until
there
was
a
solid
mile
of
it
the
federals
had
stopped
now
the
began
slowly
to
move
backward
in
the
direction
of
lerdo
the
fire
from
the
desert
slackened
and
then
from
nowhere
we
suddenly
saw
the
vultures
sailing
serene
and
motionless
in
the
blue
the
colonel
his
men
and
i
democratically
ate
lunch
in
the
shade
of
the
village
houses
our
meat
was
of
course
scorched
so
we
had
to
do
the
best
we
could
with
jerked
beef
and
which
seems
to
be
cinnamon
and
bran
ground
fine
i
never
enjoyed
a
meal
so
and
when
i
left
the
men
made
up
a
double
handful
of
cigarettes
as
a
present
said
the
colonel
i
am
sorry
that
we
had
not
time
for
a
talk
together
there
are
many
things
i
want
to
ask
you
about
your
it
is
true
for
example
that
in
your
cities
men
have
entirely
lost
the
use
of
their
legs
and
don
t
ride
horseback
in
the
streets
but
are
borne
about
in
automobiles
i
had
a
brother
once
who
worked
on
the
railroad
track
near
kansas
city
and
he
told
me
wonderful
things
but
a
man
called
him
greaser
one
day
and
shot
him
without
that
my
brother
did
anything
to
him
why
is
it
your
people
don
t
like
mexicans
i
like
many
americans
i
like
you
here
is
a
gift
for
you
he
unbuckled
one
of
his
huge
iron
spurs
inlaid
with
silver
and
gave
it
to
me
but
we
never
had
any
time
here
for
talk
these
always
annoy
us
and
then
we
have
to
get
up
and
kill
a
few
of
them
before
we
can
have
a
moment
s
peace
under
the
alamo
trees
i
found
one
of
the
photographers
and
a
man
they
were
lying
flat
on
their
backs
near
a
fire
around
which
squatted
twenty
soldiers
gorging
ravenously
flour
meat
and
coffee
one
proudly
displayed
a
silver
that
used
to
be
my
watch
explained
the
photographer
you
see
we
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
two
days
and
when
we
came
past
here
these
boys
called
us
and
gave
us
the
most
magnificent
feed
i
have
ever
tasted
after
that
i
just
couldn
t
help
giving
them
a
present
the
soldiers
had
accepted
the
gift
communally
and
were
agreeing
that
each
should
wear
it
for
two
hours
from
then
on
until
the
end
of
life
men
wednesday
my
friend
the
photographer
and
i
were
wandering
across
a
field
when
villa
came
by
on
his
horse
he
looked
tired
dirty
but
happy
reining
up
in
front
of
us
the
motions
of
his
body
as
easy
and
graceful
as
a
wolf
s
he
grinned
and
said
well
boys
how
is
it
going
now
we
answered
that
we
were
perfectly
contented
i
haven
t
time
to
worry
about
you
so
you
must
be
careful
not
to
go
into
danger
it
is
wounded
hundreds
they
are
brave
those
the
bravest
people
in
the
world
but
he
continued
delightedly
you
must
go
and
see
the
hospital
train
there
is
something
fine
for
you
to
write
your
papers
about
and
truly
it
was
a
magnificent
thing
to
see
the
hospital
train
lay
right
behind
the
work
train
now
forty
enameled
inside
stenciled
on
the
side
with
a
big
blue
cross
and
the
legend
servicio
sanitario
handled
the
wounded
as
they
came
from
the
front
they
were
fitted
inside
with
the
latest
surgical
appliances
and
manned
by
sixty
competent
american
and
mexican
doctors
every
night
shuttle
trains
carried
the
seriously
hurt
back
to
the
base
hospitals
at
chihuahua
and
parral
we
went
down
through
san
ramon
and
beyond
the
end
of
the
line
of
trees
out
across
the
desert
it
was
already
stinging
hot
in
front
a
snake
of
rifle
fire
unfolded
along
the
line
and
then
a
machine
gun
as
we
emerged
into
the
open
a
lone
mauser
began
cracking
down
to
the
right
somewhere
we
paid
no
attention
to
it
at
first
but
pretty
soon
we
noticed
that
there
was
a
little
plumping
sound
on
the
ground
around
of
dust
flew
up
every
few
minutes
by
god
said
the
photographer
some
beggar
s
sniping
at
us
instinctively
we
both
sprinted
the
rifle
shots
came
faster
it
was
a
long
distance
across
the
plain
after
a
little
we
reduced
it
to
a
finally
we
walked
along
with
the
dust
spurting
up
as
before
and
a
feeling
that
after
all
it
wouldn
t
do
any
good
to
run
then
we
forgot
it
half
an
hour
later
we
crept
through
the
brush
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
outskirts
of
gomez
and
came
upon
a
tiny
ranch
of
six
or
eight
adobe
huts
with
a
street
running
between
in
the
lee
of
one
of
the
houses
lounged
and
sprawled
about
sixty
of
contreras
ragged
fighters
they
were
playing
cards
and
talking
lazily
down
the
street
just
around
the
corner
which
pointed
straight
as
a
die
toward
the
federal
positions
a
storm
of
bullets
swept
continually
whipping
up
the
dust
these
men
had
been
on
duty
at
the
front
all
night
the
countersign
had
been
no
hats
and
they
were
in
the
broiling
sun
they
had
had
no
sleep
and
no
food
and
there
wasn
t
any
water
for
half
a
mile
there
is
a
federal
cuartel
up
ahead
there
that
is
firing
explained
a
boy
about
twelve
years
old
we
ve
got
orders
to
attack
when
the
artillery
comes
an
old
man
squatting
against
the
wall
asked
me
where
i
came
from
i
said
new
york
well
he
said
i
don
t
know
anything
about
new
york
but
i
ll
bet
you
don
t
see
such
fine
cattle
going
through
the
streets
as
you
see
in
the
streets
of
jiminez
you
don
t
see
any
cattle
in
the
streets
of
new
york
i
said
he
looked
at
me
incredulously
what
no
cattle
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
they
don
t
drive
cattle
through
the
streets
up
there
or
sheep
i
said
they
didn
t
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
thought
i
was
a
great
liar
then
he
cast
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
thought
deeply
well
he
pronounced
finally
then
i
don
t
want
to
go
there
two
skylarking
boys
started
a
game
of
tag
in
a
minute
twenty
men
were
chasing
each
other
around
in
great
glee
the
card
players
had
one
short
deck
of
torn
cards
and
at
least
eight
people
were
trying
to
play
some
game
and
arguing
about
the
rules
at
the
top
of
their
voices
or
perhaps
there
weren
t
enough
cards
to
go
around
four
or
five
had
crawled
into
the
shade
of
the
house
singing
satirical
love
songs
all
this
time
the
steady
infernal
din
up
ahead
never
relented
and
the
bullets
spattered
in
the
dust
like
rain
drops
occasionally
one
of
the
men
would
slouch
over
poke
his
rifle
around
the
corner
and
fire
we
stayed
there
about
half
an
hour
then
two
gray
cannons
came
rocketing
out
of
the
brush
behind
and
wheeled
into
position
in
a
dry
ditch
yards
away
on
the
left
i
guess
we
re
going
in
a
minute
said
the
boy
at
that
moment
three
men
galloped
up
from
the
rear
evidently
officers
they
were
entirely
exposed
to
rifle
fire
over
the
roofs
of
the
huts
but
jerked
up
their
horses
with
the
shots
yelling
all
around
contemptuous
of
them
the
first
to
speak
was
fierro
the
superb
great
animal
of
a
man
who
had
murdered
benton
he
sneered
down
at
the
ragged
soldiers
from
his
saddle
well
this
is
a
crowd
to
take
a
city
with
he
said
but
we
ve
got
nobody
else
down
here
go
in
when
you
hear
the
bugle
pulling
cruelly
on
the
bit
so
that
his
big
horse
reared
straight
up
and
whirled
on
his
hind
legs
fierro
galloped
off
rearward
saying
as
he
went
useless
those
simple
fools
of
death
to
the
butcher
said
a
man
furiously
that
murderer
killed
my
in
the
streets
of
no
crime
or
insult
my
was
very
drunk
walking
in
front
of
the
theater
he
asked
fierro
what
time
it
was
and
fierro
said
you
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
before
i
speak
to
you
but
the
bugle
was
blowing
and
up
they
got
grabbing
their
guns
the
tag
game
tried
to
stop
but
couldn
t
furious
card
players
were
accusing
each
other
of
stealing
the
deck
fidencio
cried
one
soldier
i
ll
bet
you
my
saddle
i
come
back
and
you
don
t
this
morning
i
won
a
nice
bridle
from
all
right
my
new
pinto
horse
laughing
joking
rollicking
they
swept
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
houses
into
the
rain
of
steel
they
scuttled
awkwardly
up
the
street
like
little
brown
animals
unused
to
running
billowing
dust
veiled
them
and
a
hell
of
noise
night
two
or
three
of
us
had
a
sort
of
camp
beside
the
ditch
far
up
along
the
alamos
our
car
with
its
food
supply
clothes
and
blankets
was
still
twenty
miles
back
most
of
the
time
we
went
without
meals
when
we
could
manage
to
beg
a
few
cans
of
sardines
or
some
flour
from
the
commissary
train
we
were
lucky
wednesday
one
of
the
crowd
had
managed
to
get
hold
of
tinned
salmon
coffee
crackers
and
a
big
package
of
cigarettes
and
as
we
cooked
dinner
mexican
after
mexican
passing
on
his
way
to
the
front
dismounted
and
joined
us
after
the
most
elaborate
exchange
of
courtesies
in
which
we
had
to
persuade
our
guest
to
eat
hugely
of
the
dinner
we
had
painfully
foraged
for
ourselves
and
he
had
to
comply
out
of
politeness
he
would
mount
and
ride
away
without
gratitude
though
full
of
friendliness
we
stretched
out
on
the
bank
in
the
golden
twilight
smoking
the
first
train
headed
by
a
upon
which
was
mounted
the
cannon
el
niño
had
now
reached
a
point
opposite
the
end
of
the
second
line
of
a
mile
from
town
as
far
as
you
could
see
ahead
of
her
the
repair
gang
toiled
on
the
track
all
at
once
there
came
a
terrific
boom
and
a
little
puff
of
smoke
lifted
from
the
front
of
the
train
far
cheering
scattered
among
the
trees
and
fields
el
niño
the
darling
of
the
army
had
got
within
range
at
last
now
the
federals
would
sit
up
and
take
notice
she
was
a
largest
we
had
later
we
found
out
that
an
exploratory
engine
had
sallied
forth
from
the
gomez
roundhouse
and
that
a
shot
from
el
niño
had
hit
her
square
in
the
middle
of
the
boiler
and
blown
her
up
we
were
to
attack
that
night
they
said
and
long
after
dark
i
got
on
my
horse
bucephalus
and
rode
down
front
the
sign
was
herrera
and
the
countersign
chihuahua
number
four
so
as
to
be
sure
of
recognition
as
one
of
ours
the
command
was
to
pin
your
hat
up
behind
everywhere
the
strictest
orders
had
been
sent
out
that
no
fires
should
be
lit
in
the
zone
of
fire
and
that
anyone
striking
a
match
until
the
battle
began
should
be
shot
by
the
sentries
bucephalus
and
i
jogged
slowly
along
in
the
moonless
and
absolutely
silent
night
nowhere
was
there
a
light
or
a
stir
all
over
the
vast
plain
before
gomez
except
the
far
hammering
of
the
tireless
repair
gang
working
on
the
track
in
the
town
itself
the
electric
lights
shone
brightly
and
even
a
street
car
bound
for
lerdo
lost
itself
behind
the
cerro
de
la
fila
then
i
heard
a
tiny
murmuring
of
human
voices
in
the
darkness
near
the
ditch
an
outpost
vive
came
a
shout
and
before
i
had
a
chance
to
answer
bang
he
fired
the
bullet
went
past
my
head
no
no
you
fool
drawled
an
exasperated
voice
don
t
shoot
as
soon
as
you
challenge
wait
until
he
gives
the
wrong
answer
listen
to
me
now
this
time
the
formality
was
satisfactory
to
both
sides
and
the
officer
said
usted
but
i
could
hear
the
original
sentry
growling
well
i
don
t
see
what
difference
it
makes
i
never
hit
anybody
when
i
shoot
feeling
my
way
carefully
through
the
darkness
i
stumbled
into
the
rancho
of
san
ramon
i
knew
that
the
had
all
fled
so
it
surprised
me
to
see
light
shining
around
the
chinks
of
a
door
i
was
thirsty
and
didn
t
care
to
trust
the
ditch
i
called
a
woman
appeared
with
a
little
brood
of
four
babies
clinging
to
her
skirts
she
brought
water
and
all
of
a
sudden
burst
out
with
o
señor
do
you
know
where
the
guns
of
the
brigada
zaragosa
are
my
man
is
there
and
i
haven
t
seen
him
for
seven
days
then
you
are
not
a
truly
i
am
not
she
returned
indignantly
pointing
to
her
children
we
belong
to
the
artillery
down
front
the
army
lay
stretched
along
the
ditch
at
the
foot
of
the
first
line
of
trees
in
absolute
darkness
they
whispered
to
each
other
waiting
until
the
word
of
villa
to
the
advance
guard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
should
precipitate
the
first
rifle
shots
where
are
your
rifles
i
asked
this
brigade
is
to
use
no
rifles
answered
a
voice
over
on
the
left
where
they
are
to
attack
the
intrenchments
there
are
rifles
but
we
must
capture
the
brittingham
corral
and
rifles
are
no
good
we
are
contreras
men
the
brigada
juarez
see
we
have
orders
to
walk
up
to
the
walls
and
throw
these
bombs
inside
he
held
out
the
bomb
it
was
made
of
a
short
stick
of
dynamite
sewed
in
a
strip
of
cowhide
with
a
fuse
stuck
in
one
end
he
went
on
general
robles
are
over
there
on
the
right
they
too
have
but
rifles
also
they
are
going
to
assault
the
cerro
de
la
pila
and
now
down
the
warm
still
night
came
suddenly
the
sound
of
heavy
firing
from
the
direction
of
lerdo
where
maclovio
herrera
was
going
in
with
his
brigade
almost
simultaneously
from
dead
ahead
rifle
fire
awoke
sputtering
a
man
came
down
the
line
with
a
lighted
cigar
glowing
like
a
firefly
in
the
hollow
of
his
hands
light
your
cigarettes
from
this
he
said
and
don
t
set
fire
to
your
fuses
until
you
re
right
up
under
the
wall
captain
it
s
going
to
be
very
very
how
shall
we
know
the
right
time
another
voice
deep
rough
spoke
up
in
the
dark
i
ll
tell
you
just
come
along
with
me
a
whispered
smothered
shout
of
viva
villa
burst
from
them
on
foot
holding
a
lighted
cigar
in
one
he
never
a
bomb
in
the
other
the
general
climbed
the
bank
of
the
ditch
and
plunged
into
the
brush
the
others
pouring
after
him
all
along
the
line
now
the
rifle
fire
roared
though
down
behind
the
trees
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
attack
the
artillery
was
silent
the
troops
being
too
close
together
in
the
dark
to
permit
the
use
of
shrapnel
by
either
side
i
rode
back
and
over
to
the
right
where
i
climbed
my
horse
up
the
steep
ditch
bank
from
there
i
could
see
the
dancing
tiny
fires
of
the
guns
at
lerdo
and
scattered
spurts
like
a
string
of
jewels
all
along
our
front
over
to
the
extreme
left
a
new
and
deeper
noise
told
where
benavides
was
making
a
demonstration
against
torreon
proper
with
guns
i
stood
tensely
awaiting
the
attack
it
came
with
the
force
of
an
explosion
in
the
direction
of
the
brittingham
corral
which
i
could
not
see
the
syncopated
rhythm
of
four
machine
guns
and
a
continuous
inhuman
blast
of
volleying
rifles
made
the
previous
noise
seem
like
the
deepest
silence
a
quick
glare
reddened
the
heaven
above
and
then
the
shocking
detonations
of
dynamite
i
could
imagine
the
yelling
savages
sweeping
up
the
street
against
that
withering
flame
wavering
pausing
struggling
on
again
with
villa
just
in
front
talking
to
them
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
always
did
now
more
furious
firing
over
to
the
right
indicated
that
the
attack
against
the
cerro
de
la
pila
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
all
at
once
on
the
far
end
of
the
ridge
toward
lerdo
there
were
flashes
maclovio
must
have
taken
lerdo
lo
all
at
once
appeared
a
magical
sight
up
the
steep
slope
of
the
cerro
around
three
sides
of
it
slowly
rose
a
ring
of
fierce
light
it
was
the
steady
flame
of
rifle
fire
from
the
attackers
the
summit
too
streamed
fire
which
intensified
as
the
ring
converged
toward
it
raggeder
now
a
bright
glare
burst
from
the
another
a
second
later
arrived
the
dreadful
reports
of
cannon
they
were
opening
upon
the
little
line
of
climbing
men
with
artillery
but
still
they
rose
upon
the
black
hill
the
ring
of
flame
was
broken
now
in
many
places
but
it
never
faltered
so
until
it
seemed
to
merge
with
the
venomous
spitting
blaze
at
the
summit
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
wither
completely
and
little
single
fireflies
kept
dropping
down
the
that
were
left
and
when
i
thought
that
all
was
lost
and
marveled
at
the
useless
heroism
of
these
peons
who
walked
up
a
hill
in
the
face
of
artillery
behold
the
ring
of
flame
was
creeping
slowly
upward
again
that
night
they
attacked
the
cerro
seven
times
on
foot
and
at
every
attack
of
them
were
killed
all
this
time
the
infernal
roaring
and
the
play
of
red
light
over
the
corral
did
not
stop
occasionally
there
seemed
to
come
a
lull
but
it
recommenced
only
more
terribly
they
assaulted
the
corral
eight
times
the
morning
that
i
entered
gomez
although
the
federals
had
been
steadily
burning
bodies
for
three
days
they
were
so
thick
in
the
wide
space
before
the
brittingham
corral
that
i
could
hardly
ride
through
on
horseback
and
around
the
cerro
were
seven
distinct
ridges
of
rebel
dead
the
wounded
began
creeping
through
the
plain
obscurely
in
the
dense
darkness
their
cries
and
groans
could
be
distinctly
heard
though
the
battle
noise
drowned
every
other
could
even
hear
the
rustle
of
the
bushes
as
they
crept
through
and
their
dragging
feet
on
the
sand
a
horseman
passed
along
the
path
below
me
cursing
furiously
that
he
must
leave
the
battle
because
his
arm
was
broken
and
weeping
between
curses
then
came
a
footman
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
my
bank
and
nursed
a
hand
talking
without
cessation
about
all
sorts
of
things
to
keep
from
a
nervous
breakdown
how
brave
we
mexicans
are
he
said
drolly
killing
each
other
like
this
i
soon
went
back
to
camp
sick
with
boredom
a
battle
is
the
most
boring
thing
in
the
world
if
it
lasts
any
length
of
time
it
is
all
the
same
and
in
the
morning
i
went
to
get
the
news
at
headquarters
we
had
captured
lerdo
but
the
cerro
the
corral
and
the
cuartel
were
still
the
enemy
s
all
that
slaughter
for
nothing
fall
of
gomez
el
niño
was
now
within
half
a
mile
of
the
town
and
the
workmen
of
the
repair
gang
labored
on
the
last
stretch
of
track
under
heavy
shrapnel
fire
the
two
cannon
on
the
front
of
the
trains
bore
all
the
brunt
of
their
artillery
and
bravely
did
they
return
the
well
in
fact
that
after
one
federal
shell
had
killed
ten
workmen
el
niño
s
captain
put
two
guns
on
the
cerro
out
of
action
so
the
federals
left
the
trains
alone
and
turned
their
attention
to
shelling
herrera
out
of
lerdo
the
constitutionalist
army
was
terribly
shattered
in
the
four
days
fighting
about
a
thousand
men
had
been
killed
and
almost
two
thousand
more
wounded
even
the
excellent
hospital
train
was
inadequate
to
handle
the
wounded
out
on
the
wide
plain
where
we
were
the
faint
smell
of
dead
bodies
pervaded
everything
in
gomez
it
must
have
been
horrible
thursday
the
smoke
from
twenty
funeral
pyres
stained
the
sky
but
villa
was
more
determined
than
ever
gomez
must
be
taken
and
quickly
he
didn
t
have
ammunition
or
supplies
enough
for
a
siege
and
moreover
his
name
was
a
legend
already
with
the
pancho
villa
appeared
in
battle
they
had
begun
to
believe
it
lost
and
the
effect
on
his
own
troops
was
most
important
too
so
he
scheduled
another
night
attack
the
track
is
all
repaired
reported
calzado
superintendent
of
the
railways
good
said
villa
bring
up
all
the
trains
from
the
rear
because
we
re
going
into
gomez
in
the
morning
night
fell
breathless
silent
night
with
a
sound
of
frogs
along
the
ditches
across
the
front
of
the
town
the
soldiers
lay
waiting
for
the
word
to
attack
wounded
worn
out
nervously
broken
they
straggled
to
the
front
keyed
up
to
the
last
notch
of
desperation
this
night
they
would
not
be
repulsed
they
would
take
the
town
or
die
where
they
stood
and
as
nine
o
clock
approached
the
hour
at
which
the
attack
had
been
set
the
tension
became
dangerous
nine
o
clock
came
and
a
sound
or
movement
for
some
reason
the
order
was
withheld
ten
o
clock
suddenly
off
to
the
right
a
volley
burst
from
the
town
all
along
our
line
awoke
the
answer
but
after
a
few
more
volleys
the
federal
fire
altogether
ceased
from
the
town
came
other
more
mysterious
sounds
the
electric
lights
went
out
and
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
subtle
stir
and
movement
indefinable
at
length
the
order
was
given
to
advance
but
as
our
men
crept
forward
in
the
dark
the
front
rank
suddenly
gave
a
yell
and
the
truth
spread
through
the
ranks
and
out
into
the
country
in
one
triumphant
shout
gomez
palacio
had
been
evacuated
with
a
great
babble
of
voices
the
army
poured
into
the
town
a
few
scattered
shots
sounded
where
our
troops
caught
some
of
the
federals
the
federal
army
had
gutted
the
whole
town
before
it
left
and
then
our
army
began
to
loot
their
shouts
and
drunken
singing
and
the
sounds
of
smashing
doors
reached
us
out
on
the
plain
little
tongues
of
flame
flickered
up
where
the
soldiers
were
burning
some
house
that
had
been
a
fort
of
federals
but
the
looting
of
the
rebels
was
confined
as
it
almost
always
is
to
food
and
drink
and
clothes
to
cover
them
they
disturbed
no
private
house
the
chiefs
of
the
army
winked
at
this
a
specific
order
was
issued
by
villa
stating
that
whatever
any
soldier
picked
up
was
his
and
could
not
be
taken
from
him
by
an
officer
now
up
to
this
time
there
was
not
much
of
stealing
in
the
least
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
but
the
morning
of
the
entry
into
gomez
a
curious
change
had
come
over
the
psychology
of
the
soldiers
i
woke
at
our
camp
beside
the
ditch
to
find
my
horse
gone
bucephalus
had
been
stolen
in
the
night
and
i
never
saw
him
again
during
breakfast
several
troopers
dropped
in
to
share
our
they
had
gone
we
missed
a
knife
and
a
revolver
the
truth
was
that
everybody
was
looting
from
everybody
else
so
i
too
stole
what
i
needed
there
was
a
great
gray
mule
grazing
in
the
field
near
by
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
i
put
my
saddle
on
him
and
rode
down
toward
the
front
he
was
a
noble
at
least
four
times
as
much
as
bucephalus
as
i
soon
discovered
everybody
i
met
coveted
that
mule
one
trooper
marching
along
with
two
rifles
hailed
me
where
did
you
get
that
mule
i
found
him
in
a
field
said
i
unwisely
it
is
just
as
i
thought
he
exclaimed
that
is
my
mule
get
off
and
give
him
to
me
at
once
and
is
this
your
saddle
i
asked
by
the
mother
of
god
it
is
then
you
lie
about
the
mule
for
the
saddle
is
my
own
i
rode
on
leaving
him
yelling
in
the
road
a
short
distance
farther
on
an
old
peon
walking
along
suddenly
ran
up
and
threw
his
arms
around
the
animal
s
neck
ah
at
last
my
beautiful
mule
which
i
lost
my
juanito
i
shook
him
off
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
that
at
least
i
should
pay
him
fifty
pesos
as
compensation
for
his
mule
in
town
a
cavalryman
rode
across
in
front
of
me
demanding
his
mule
at
once
he
was
rather
ugly
and
had
a
revolver
i
got
away
by
saying
that
i
was
a
captain
of
artillery
and
that
the
mule
belonged
to
my
battery
every
few
feet
some
owner
of
that
mule
sprang
up
and
asked
me
how
dared
i
ride
his
own
dear
panchito
or
pedrito
or
tomasito
at
last
one
came
out
of
a
cuartel
with
a
written
order
from
his
colonel
who
had
seen
the
mule
from
his
window
i
showed
them
my
pass
signed
by
francisco
villa
that
was
enough
across
the
wide
desert
where
the
constitutionalists
had
fought
so
long
the
army
was
winding
in
from
every
direction
in
long
columns
dust
hanging
over
them
and
along
the
track
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
came
the
trains
one
after
another
blowing
triumphant
whistles
crowded
with
thousands
of
women
and
soldiers
cheering
within
the
city
dawn
had
brought
absolute
quiet
and
order
with
the
entrance
of
villa
and
his
staff
the
looting
had
absolutely
ceased
and
the
soldiers
again
respected
other
people
s
property
a
thousand
were
hard
at
work
gathering
up
the
bodies
and
carrying
them
to
the
edge
of
the
city
where
they
were
set
on
fire
five
hundred
more
policed
the
town
the
first
order
issued
was
that
any
soldier
caught
drinking
should
be
shot
in
the
third
train
was
our
private
fitted
up
for
the
correspondents
photographers
and
men
at
last
we
had
our
bunks
our
blankets
and
fong
our
beloved
chinese
cook
the
car
was
switched
up
near
in
the
railway
the
very
front
rank
of
trains
and
as
we
gathered
in
its
grateful
interior
hot
dusty
and
worn
out
the
federals
in
torreon
dropped
a
few
shrapnel
shells
right
close
beside
us
i
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
car
at
the
time
and
heard
the
boom
of
cannon
but
paid
no
particular
attention
to
it
suddenly
i
noticed
a
small
object
in
the
air
like
an
exaggerated
beetle
trailing
a
little
spiral
of
black
smoke
behind
it
it
passed
the
door
of
the
car
with
a
zzzzzing
noise
and
about
forty
feet
beyond
burst
with
a
frightful
among
the
trees
of
a
park
where
a
company
of
cavalry
and
their
women
were
camping
a
hundred
men
leaped
for
their
plunging
horses
in
a
panic
and
galloped
frantically
toward
the
rear
the
women
streaming
after
them
two
women
had
been
killed
it
seemed
and
a
horse
blankets
food
were
discarded
in
the
panic
pow
another
burst
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
they
were
very
close
behind
us
on
the
track
twenty
long
trains
laden
with
shrilly
screaming
women
were
trying
to
back
out
of
the
yards
all
at
once
with
a
mighty
hysterical
tooting
of
whistles
two
or
three
more
shells
followed
then
we
could
hear
el
niño
replying
but
the
effect
on
the
correspondents
and
newspaper
men
was
peculiar
no
sooner
had
the
first
shell
exploded
than
someone
produced
the
whisky
jug
entirely
of
his
own
impulse
and
we
passed
it
around
no
one
said
a
word
but
everybody
drank
a
stiff
swig
as
it
came
his
way
every
time
a
shell
would
explode
nearby
we
would
all
wince
and
jump
but
after
a
while
we
did
not
mind
it
then
we
began
to
congratulate
each
other
and
ourselves
for
being
so
brave
as
to
stay
by
the
car
under
artillery
fire
our
courage
increased
as
the
firing
grew
far
between
and
finally
quit
altogether
and
as
the
whisky
grew
low
everybody
forgot
dinner
i
remember
that
in
the
darkness
two
belligerent
stood
at
the
door
of
the
car
challenging
the
soldiers
who
passed
and
abusing
them
in
the
most
discourteous
language
we
fell
out
among
ourselves
too
and
one
man
almost
choked
a
driveling
old
fool
who
was
with
the
outfit
late
that
night
we
were
still
trying
earnestly
to
persuade
two
of
the
boys
not
to
sally
forth
without
the
and
reconnoiter
the
federal
lines
at
torreon
aw
what
s
there
to
be
afraid
of
cried
they
a
mexican
greaser
hasn
t
any
guts
one
american
can
lick
fifty
mexicans
why
did
you
see
how
they
ran
this
afternoon
when
the
shells
hit
that
grove
and
how
stayed
by
the
car
when
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
in
juarez
which
ended
the
revolution
of
francisco
madero
proceeded
south
toward
mexico
city
everywhere
he
spoke
to
enthusiastic
and
triumphant
throngs
of
peons
who
acclaimed
him
the
liberator
in
chihuahua
he
addressed
the
people
from
the
balcony
of
the
governor
s
palace
as
he
told
of
the
hardships
endured
and
the
sacrifices
made
by
the
little
band
of
men
who
had
overthrown
the
dictatorship
of
diaz
forever
he
was
overcome
with
emotion
reaching
inside
the
room
he
pulled
out
a
tall
bearded
man
of
commanding
presence
and
throwing
his
arm
about
his
shoulder
he
said
in
a
voice
choked
with
tears
this
is
a
good
man
love
and
honor
him
always
it
was
venustiano
carranza
a
man
of
upright
life
and
high
ideals
an
aristocrat
descended
from
the
dominant
spanish
race
a
great
as
his
family
had
always
been
great
and
one
of
those
mexican
nobles
who
like
a
few
french
nobles
such
as
lafayette
in
the
french
revolution
threw
themselves
heart
and
soul
into
the
struggle
for
liberty
when
the
madero
revolution
broke
out
carranza
took
the
field
in
truly
medieval
fashion
he
armed
the
peons
who
worked
upon
his
great
estates
and
led
them
to
war
like
any
feudal
overlord
and
when
the
revolution
was
done
madero
made
him
governor
of
coahuila
there
he
was
when
madero
was
murdered
at
the
capital
and
huerta
seizing
the
presidency
sent
a
circular
letter
to
the
governors
of
the
different
states
ordering
them
to
acknowledge
the
new
dictatorship
carranza
refused
even
to
answer
the
letter
declaring
that
he
would
have
no
dealings
with
a
murderer
and
a
usurper
he
issued
a
proclamation
calling
the
mexican
people
to
arms
proclaiming
himself
first
chief
of
the
revolution
and
inviting
the
friends
of
liberty
to
rally
around
him
then
he
marched
out
from
his
capital
and
took
the
field
where
he
assisted
in
the
early
fighting
around
torreon
after
a
short
time
carranza
marched
his
force
from
coahuila
where
things
were
happening
straight
across
the
republic
into
the
state
of
sonora
where
nothing
was
happening
villa
had
begun
heavy
fighting
in
chihuahua
state
urbina
and
herrera
in
durango
blanco
and
others
in
coahuila
and
gonzales
near
tampico
in
times
of
upheaval
like
these
it
is
inevitable
that
there
shall
be
some
preliminary
squabbling
over
the
ultimate
spoils
of
war
among
the
military
leaders
however
there
was
no
such
dissension
villa
having
just
been
unanimously
elected
general
chief
of
the
constitutionalist
army
by
a
remarkable
gathering
of
all
the
independent
guerrilla
leaders
before
torreon
event
in
mexican
history
but
over
in
sonora
maytorena
and
pesquiera
were
already
squabbling
over
who
should
be
governor
of
the
state
and
threatening
revolutions
against
each
other
carranza
s
reported
purpose
in
crossing
to
the
west
with
his
army
was
to
settle
this
dispute
but
that
doesn
t
seem
possible
other
explanations
are
that
he
desired
to
secure
a
seaport
for
the
constitutionalists
on
the
west
that
he
wanted
to
settle
the
yaqui
land
question
and
that
in
the
quiet
of
a
comparatively
peaceful
state
he
could
better
organize
the
provisional
government
of
the
new
republic
he
remained
there
six
months
apparently
doing
nothing
whatever
keeping
a
force
of
more
than
good
fighters
practically
inoperative
attending
banquets
and
establishing
and
celebrating
innumerable
new
national
holidays
and
issuing
proclamations
his
army
twice
or
three
times
as
big
as
the
disheartened
garrisons
of
guaymas
and
mazatlan
kept
up
a
lazy
siege
of
those
places
mazatlan
fell
only
a
short
time
ago
i
think
as
did
guaymas
only
a
few
weeks
ago
maytorena
was
threatening
against
general
alvardo
chief
of
arms
of
sonora
because
he
would
not
guarantee
the
governor
s
safety
and
evidently
proposing
to
upset
the
revolution
because
maytorena
was
uncomfortable
in
the
palace
at
hermosillo
during
all
that
time
not
a
word
was
said
about
any
aspect
of
the
land
question
as
far
as
i
could
learn
the
yaqui
indians
the
expropriation
of
whose
lands
is
the
blackest
spot
in
the
whole
black
history
of
the
diaz
regime
got
nothing
but
a
vague
promise
upon
that
the
whole
tribe
joined
the
revolution
but
a
few
months
later
most
of
them
went
back
to
their
homes
and
began
again
their
hopeless
campaign
against
the
white
man
carranza
hibernated
until
early
in
the
spring
of
this
year
when
the
purpose
of
his
sonora
sojourn
evidently
having
been
accomplished
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
territory
where
the
real
revolution
was
being
fought
within
that
six
months
the
aspect
of
things
had
entirely
changed
except
for
the
northern
part
of
nueva
leon
and
most
of
coahuila
northern
mexico
was
constitutionalist
territory
almost
from
sea
to
sea
and
villa
with
a
force
of
men
was
entering
on
the
torreon
campaign
all
this
was
accomplished
almost
by
villa
carranza
seems
to
have
contributed
nothing
but
congratulations
he
had
indeed
formed
a
provisional
government
an
immense
throng
of
opportunist
politicians
surrounded
the
first
chief
loud
in
their
protestations
of
devotion
to
the
cause
liberal
with
proclamations
and
extremely
jealous
of
each
other
and
of
villa
little
by
little
carranza
s
personality
seemed
to
be
engulfed
in
the
personality
of
his
cabinet
although
his
name
remained
as
prominent
as
ever
it
was
a
curious
situation
correspondents
who
were
with
him
during
these
months
have
told
me
how
secluded
the
first
chief
finally
became
they
almost
never
saw
him
very
rarely
did
they
speak
with
him
various
secretaries
officials
cabinet
members
stood
between
them
and
diplomatic
devious
gentlemen
who
transmitted
their
questions
to
carranza
on
paper
and
brought
them
back
his
answers
written
out
so
that
there
would
be
no
mistake
but
whatever
he
did
carranza
left
villa
strictly
alone
to
undergo
defeats
if
he
must
or
make
mistakes
so
much
so
that
villa
himself
was
forced
to
deal
with
foreign
powers
as
if
he
were
the
head
of
the
government
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
politicians
at
hermosillo
sought
in
every
way
to
make
carranza
jealous
of
villa
s
growing
power
in
the
north
in
february
the
first
chief
began
a
leisurely
journey
northward
accompanied
by
troops
with
the
ostensible
object
of
sending
reinforcements
to
villa
and
of
making
his
provisional
capital
in
juarez
when
villa
left
for
torreon
two
correspondents
however
who
had
been
in
sonora
told
me
that
the
officers
of
this
immense
bodyguard
believed
that
they
were
to
be
sent
against
villa
himself
in
hermosillo
carranza
had
been
remote
from
the
world
s
new
centers
no
one
knew
but
what
he
might
be
accomplishing
great
things
but
when
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
began
to
move
toward
the
american
border
the
attention
of
the
world
was
concentrated
upon
him
and
the
attention
of
the
world
revealed
so
little
to
concentrate
upon
that
rumors
rapidly
spread
of
the
of
carranza
for
example
one
paper
said
that
he
was
insane
and
another
alleged
that
he
had
disappeared
altogether
i
was
in
chihuahua
at
the
time
my
paper
wired
me
these
rumors
and
ordered
me
to
go
and
find
carranza
it
was
at
the
immensely
exciting
time
of
the
benton
murder
all
the
protestations
and
threats
of
the
british
and
american
governments
converged
upon
villa
but
by
the
time
i
had
received
the
message
carranza
and
his
cabinet
had
arrived
at
the
border
and
broken
the
six
months
silence
in
a
startling
way
the
first
chief
s
declaration
to
the
state
department
was
practically
this
you
have
made
a
mistake
in
addressing
representations
in
the
benton
case
to
general
villa
they
should
be
addressed
to
me
as
first
chief
of
the
revolution
and
head
of
the
provisional
constitutionalist
government
moreover
the
united
states
has
no
business
to
address
even
to
me
any
representations
concerning
benton
who
was
a
british
subject
i
have
received
no
envoy
from
the
government
of
great
britain
until
i
do
i
will
make
no
answer
to
the
representations
of
any
other
government
meanwhile
a
thorough
investigation
will
be
made
of
the
circumstances
of
benton
s
death
and
those
responsible
for
it
will
be
judged
strictly
according
to
law
at
the
same
time
villa
received
a
pretty
plain
intimation
that
he
was
to
keep
out
of
international
affairs
and
villa
gratefully
shut
up
that
was
the
situation
when
i
went
to
nogales
nogales
arizona
and
nogales
sonora
mexico
really
form
one
big
straggling
town
the
international
boundary
runs
along
the
middle
of
the
street
and
at
a
small
lounge
a
few
ragged
mexican
sentries
smoking
interminable
cigarettes
and
evidently
interfering
with
nobody
except
to
collect
export
taxes
from
everything
that
passes
to
the
american
side
the
inhabitants
of
the
american
town
go
across
the
line
to
get
good
things
to
eat
to
gamble
to
dance
and
to
feel
free
the
mexicans
cross
to
the
american
side
when
somebody
is
after
them
i
arrived
at
midnight
and
went
at
once
to
a
hotel
in
the
mexican
town
where
the
cabinet
and
most
of
the
political
of
carranza
were
staying
sleeping
four
in
a
room
on
cots
in
the
corridors
on
the
floor
and
even
on
the
stairs
i
was
expected
a
temperamental
constitutionalist
consul
up
the
line
to
whom
i
had
explained
my
errand
evidently
considered
it
of
great
importance
for
he
had
telegraphed
to
nogales
that
the
entire
fate
of
the
mexican
revolution
depended
upon
reed
s
seeing
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
immediately
upon
his
arrival
however
everybody
had
gone
to
sleep
and
the
proprietor
routed
out
of
his
back
office
said
that
he
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
what
the
names
of
any
of
the
gentlemen
were
or
where
they
slept
yes
he
said
he
had
heard
that
carranza
was
in
town
we
went
around
kicking
doors
and
mexicans
until
we
stumbled
upon
an
unshaven
but
courteous
gentleman
who
said
that
he
was
the
collector
of
customs
for
the
whole
of
mexico
under
the
new
government
he
waked
up
in
turn
the
secretary
of
the
navy
who
routed
out
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
finally
flushed
the
secretary
of
hacienda
who
finally
brought
us
to
the
room
of
the
secretary
of
foreign
relations
señor
isidro
fabela
señor
fabela
said
that
the
first
chief
had
retired
and
couldn
t
see
me
but
that
he
himself
would
give
me
immediately
a
statement
of
just
what
carranza
thought
about
the
benton
incident
now
none
of
the
newspapers
had
ever
heard
of
señor
fabela
before
they
were
all
clamoring
to
their
correspondents
wanting
to
know
who
he
was
he
seemed
to
be
such
an
important
member
of
the
provisional
government
and
yet
his
antecedents
were
not
known
at
all
at
different
times
he
apparently
filled
most
of
the
positions
in
the
first
chief
s
cabinet
rather
medium
height
and
suave
courteous
and
evidently
very
well
educated
his
face
was
decidedly
jewish
we
talked
for
a
long
time
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
he
told
me
what
the
first
chief
s
aims
and
ideals
were
but
in
them
i
could
discern
nothing
of
the
first
chief
s
personality
whatever
oh
yes
he
said
of
course
i
could
see
the
first
chief
in
the
morning
of
course
he
would
receive
me
but
when
we
came
right
down
to
cases
señor
fabela
told
me
that
the
first
chief
would
answer
no
questions
outright
they
had
all
to
be
put
in
writing
he
said
and
submitted
to
fabela
first
he
would
then
take
them
to
carranza
and
bring
back
his
answer
accordingly
the
next
morning
i
wrote
out
on
paper
about
questions
and
gave
them
to
fabela
he
read
them
carefully
ah
he
said
there
are
many
questions
here
that
i
know
the
first
chief
will
not
answer
i
advise
you
to
strike
them
out
well
if
he
doesn
t
answer
them
i
said
all
right
but
i
would
like
to
give
him
a
chance
to
see
them
he
could
only
refuse
to
answer
them
no
said
fabela
politely
you
had
better
strike
them
out
now
i
know
exactly
what
he
will
answer
and
what
he
will
not
you
see
some
of
your
questions
might
prejudice
him
against
answering
all
the
rest
and
you
would
not
want
that
to
occur
would
you
señor
fabela
i
said
are
you
sure
that
you
know
just
what
don
venustiano
won
t
answer
i
know
that
he
won
t
answer
these
he
replied
indicating
four
or
five
which
dealt
rather
specifically
with
the
platform
of
the
constitutionalist
government
such
as
land
distribution
direct
elections
and
the
right
of
suffrage
among
the
peons
i
will
bring
back
your
answers
in
hours
he
said
now
i
will
take
you
to
see
the
chief
but
you
must
promise
me
this
that
you
will
not
ask
him
any
questions
you
will
simply
go
into
the
room
shake
hands
with
him
and
say
how
do
you
do
and
leave
again
immediately
i
promised
and
together
with
another
reporter
followed
him
across
the
square
to
the
beautiful
little
yellow
municipal
palace
we
stood
a
while
in
the
patio
the
place
was
thronged
with
mexicans
other
mexicans
who
rushed
from
door
to
door
with
portfolios
and
bundles
of
papers
occasionally
when
the
door
of
the
department
of
the
secretaryship
opened
a
roar
of
typewriters
smote
our
ears
officers
in
uniform
stood
about
the
portico
waiting
for
orders
general
obregon
commander
of
the
army
of
sonora
was
outlining
in
a
loud
voice
the
plans
for
his
march
south
upon
guadalajara
he
started
for
hermosillo
three
days
afterward
and
marched
his
army
four
hundred
miles
through
a
friendly
country
in
three
months
although
obregon
had
shown
no
startling
capacity
for
leadership
carranza
had
made
him
of
the
army
of
the
with
a
rank
equal
to
villa
s
talking
to
him
was
a
stout
mexican
woman
in
a
black
satin
princess
dress
embroidered
with
jet
with
a
sword
at
her
side
she
was
colonel
ramona
flores
to
the
constitutionalist
general
carrasco
who
operates
in
tepic
her
husband
had
been
killed
while
an
officer
in
the
first
revolution
leaving
her
a
with
the
proceeds
of
which
she
had
raised
a
regiment
and
taken
the
field
against
the
wall
lay
two
sacks
of
gold
ingots
which
she
had
brought
north
to
purchase
arms
and
uniforms
for
her
troops
polite
american
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
hat
in
hand
the
arms
and
ammunition
drummers
poured
into
the
ears
of
whoever
would
listen
praises
of
their
guns
and
bullets
four
armed
sentries
stood
at
the
palace
doors
and
others
lounged
around
the
patio
there
were
no
more
in
sight
except
two
who
flanked
a
little
door
down
the
corridor
these
men
seemed
more
intelligent
than
the
others
anybody
who
passed
was
scrutinized
carefully
and
those
who
paused
at
the
door
were
questioned
according
to
some
thorough
formula
every
two
hours
this
guard
was
changed
the
relief
was
in
charge
of
a
general
and
a
long
colloquy
took
place
before
the
change
was
effected
what
room
is
that
i
asked
señor
fabela
that
is
the
office
of
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
he
answered
i
waited
for
perhaps
an
hour
and
during
that
time
i
noticed
that
nobody
entered
the
room
except
señor
fabela
and
those
he
took
with
him
finally
he
came
over
to
me
and
said
all
right
the
first
chief
will
see
you
now
we
followed
him
the
soldiers
on
guard
threw
up
their
rifles
who
are
these
señores
asked
one
it
s
all
right
they
are
friends
answered
fabela
and
opened
the
door
it
was
so
dark
within
that
at
first
we
could
see
nothing
over
the
two
windows
blinds
were
drawn
on
one
side
was
a
bed
still
unmade
and
on
the
other
a
small
table
covered
with
papers
upon
which
stood
a
tray
containing
the
remains
of
breakfast
a
tin
bucket
full
of
ice
with
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
stood
in
a
corner
as
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
we
saw
the
gigantic
figure
of
don
venustiano
carranza
sitting
in
a
big
chair
there
was
something
strange
in
the
way
he
sat
there
with
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
as
if
he
had
been
placed
in
it
and
told
not
to
move
he
did
not
seem
to
be
thinking
nor
to
have
been
working
couldn
t
imagine
him
at
that
table
you
got
the
impression
of
a
vast
inert
statue
he
rose
to
meet
us
a
towering
figure
seven
feet
tall
it
seemed
i
noticed
with
a
kind
of
shock
that
in
that
dark
room
he
wore
smoked
glasses
and
although
ruddy
and
i
felt
that
he
was
not
well
thing
you
feel
about
tuberculous
patients
that
tiny
dark
room
where
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
slept
and
ate
and
worked
and
from
which
he
hardly
ever
emerged
seemed
too
a
cell
fabela
had
entered
with
us
he
introduced
us
one
by
one
to
carranza
who
smiled
a
vacant
expressionless
smile
bowed
slightly
and
shook
our
hands
we
all
sat
down
indicating
the
other
reporter
who
could
not
speak
spanish
fabela
said
these
gentlemen
have
come
to
greet
you
on
behalf
of
the
great
newspapers
which
they
represent
this
gentleman
says
that
he
desires
to
present
his
respectful
wishes
for
your
success
carranza
bowed
again
slightly
and
rose
as
fabela
stood
up
as
if
to
indicate
that
the
interview
was
over
allow
me
to
assure
the
gentlemen
he
said
of
my
grateful
acceptance
of
their
good
wishes
again
we
all
shook
hands
but
as
i
took
his
hand
i
said
in
spanish
señor
don
venustiano
my
paper
is
your
friend
and
the
friend
of
the
constitutionalists
he
stood
there
as
before
a
huge
mask
of
a
man
but
as
i
spoke
he
stopped
smiling
his
expression
remained
as
vacant
as
before
but
suddenly
he
began
to
speak
to
the
united
states
i
say
the
benton
case
is
none
of
your
business
benton
was
a
british
subject
i
will
answer
to
the
delegates
of
great
britain
when
they
come
to
me
with
representations
of
their
government
why
should
they
not
come
to
me
england
now
has
an
ambassador
in
mexico
city
who
accepts
invitations
to
dinner
from
huerta
takes
off
his
hat
to
him
and
shakes
hands
with
him
when
madero
was
murdered
the
foreign
powers
flocked
to
the
spot
like
vultures
to
the
dead
and
fawned
upon
the
murderer
because
they
had
a
few
subjects
in
the
republic
who
were
petty
tradesmen
doing
a
dirty
little
business
the
first
chief
ended
as
abruptly
as
he
had
begun
with
the
same
immobility
of
expression
but
he
clenched
and
unclenched
his
hands
and
gnawed
his
mustaches
fabela
hurriedly
made
a
move
toward
the
door
the
gentlemen
are
very
grateful
to
you
for
having
received
them
he
said
nervously
but
don
venustiano
paid
no
attention
to
him
suddenly
he
began
again
his
voice
pitched
a
little
higher
and
louder
these
cowardly
nations
thought
they
could
secure
advantages
by
standing
in
with
the
government
of
the
usurper
but
the
rapid
advancement
of
the
constitutionalists
showed
them
their
error
and
now
they
find
themselves
in
a
predicament
fabela
was
plainly
nervous
when
does
the
torreon
campaign
begin
he
asked
attempting
to
change
the
subject
the
killing
of
benton
was
due
to
a
vicious
attack
on
villa
by
an
enemy
of
the
revolutionists
roared
the
first
chief
speaking
louder
and
louder
and
more
rapidly
and
england
the
bully
of
the
world
finds
herself
unable
to
deal
with
us
unless
she
humiliates
herself
by
sending
a
representative
to
the
constitutionalists
so
she
tried
to
use
the
united
states
as
a
cat
s
paw
more
shame
to
the
united
states
he
cried
shaking
his
fists
that
she
allowed
herself
to
join
with
these
infamous
powers
the
unhappy
fabela
made
another
attempt
to
dam
the
dangerous
torrent
but
carranza
took
a
step
forward
and
raising
his
arm
shouted
i
tell
you
that
if
the
united
states
intervenes
in
mexico
upon
this
petty
excuse
intervention
will
not
accomplish
what
it
thinks
but
will
provoke
a
war
which
besides
its
own
consequences
will
deepen
a
profound
hatred
between
the
united
states
and
the
whole
of
latin
america
a
hatred
which
will
endanger
the
entire
political
future
of
the
united
states
he
ceased
talking
on
a
rising
note
as
if
something
inside
had
cut
off
his
speech
i
tried
to
think
that
here
was
the
voice
of
aroused
mexico
thundering
at
her
enemies
but
it
seemed
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
slightly
senile
old
man
tired
and
irritated
then
we
were
outside
in
the
sunlight
with
señor
fabela
agitatedly
telling
me
not
to
publish
what
i
had
heard
at
least
to
let
him
see
the
dispatch
i
stayed
at
nogales
a
day
or
two
longer
the
next
day
after
my
interview
the
typewritten
paper
upon
which
my
questions
had
been
printed
was
returned
to
me
the
answers
written
in
five
different
handwritings
newspaper
men
were
in
high
favor
at
nogales
they
were
treated
always
with
the
utmost
courtesy
by
the
members
of
the
provisional
cabinet
but
they
never
seemed
to
reach
the
first
chief
i
tried
often
to
get
from
these
cabinet
members
the
least
expression
of
what
their
plans
were
for
the
settlement
of
the
troubles
which
caused
the
revolution
but
they
seemed
to
have
none
except
a
constitutional
government
during
all
the
times
i
talked
with
them
i
never
detected
one
gleam
of
sympathy
for
or
understanding
of
the
peons
now
and
again
i
surprised
quarrels
about
who
was
going
to
fill
the
high
posts
of
the
new
mexican
government
villa
s
name
was
hardly
ever
mentioned
when
it
was
it
was
in
this
manner
we
have
every
confidence
in
villa
s
loyalty
and
obedience
as
a
fighting
man
villa
has
done
very
well
indeed
but
he
should
not
attempt
to
mingle
in
the
affairs
of
government
because
of
course
you
know
villa
is
only
an
ignorant
peon
he
has
said
many
foolish
things
and
made
many
mistakes
which
we
will
have
to
remedy
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
but
what
carranza
would
give
out
a
statement
from
headquarters
there
is
no
misunderstanding
between
general
villa
and
myself
he
obeys
my
orders
without
question
as
any
common
soldier
it
is
unthinkable
that
he
would
do
anything
else
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
loafing
around
the
municipal
palace
but
i
never
saw
carranza
again
but
once
it
was
toward
sunset
and
most
of
the
generals
drummers
and
politicians
had
gone
to
dinner
i
lounged
on
the
edge
of
the
fountain
in
the
middle
of
the
patio
talking
with
some
soldiers
suddenly
the
door
of
that
little
office
opened
and
carranza
himself
stood
framed
in
it
arms
hanging
loosely
by
his
sides
his
fine
old
head
thrown
back
as
he
stared
blindly
over
our
heads
across
the
wall
to
the
flaming
clouds
in
the
west
we
stood
up
and
bowed
but
he
didn
t
notice
us
walking
with
slow
steps
he
came
out
and
went
along
the
portico
toward
the
door
of
the
palace
the
two
guards
presented
arms
as
he
passed
they
shouldered
their
rifles
and
fell
in
behind
him
at
the
doorway
he
stopped
and
stood
there
a
long
time
looking
out
on
the
street
the
four
sentries
jumped
to
attention
the
two
men
behind
him
grounded
their
arms
and
stopped
the
first
chief
of
the
revolution
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
fingers
working
violently
then
he
turned
and
pacing
between
the
two
guards
went
back
to
the
little
dark
room
el
cosmopolita
is
chihuahua
s
fashionable
gambling
hell
it
used
to
be
owned
by
jacob
la
the
turk
fat
shambling
man
who
came
to
chihuahua
barefooted
with
a
dancing
bear
years
ago
and
became
many
times
a
millionaire
he
owned
an
extravagant
residence
on
the
paseo
bolivar
which
was
never
called
anything
but
the
palace
of
tears
because
it
was
built
with
the
proceeds
of
the
turk
s
gambling
concessions
which
ruined
many
families
but
the
wicked
old
man
slunk
away
with
mercado
s
retreating
federal
army
and
when
villa
came
to
chihuahua
he
gave
the
palace
of
tears
to
general
ortega
as
a
christmas
present
and
confiscated
el
cosmopolita
having
a
few
idle
pesos
from
my
expense
account
we
used
to
frequent
el
cosmopolita
johnny
roberts
and
i
stopped
on
our
way
from
the
hotel
to
take
a
few
hot
at
a
chinese
bar
run
by
a
hoary
mongolian
named
chee
lee
from
there
we
proceeded
to
the
gaming
tables
with
the
leisurely
air
of
russian
grand
dukes
at
monte
carlo
one
entered
first
a
long
low
room
lighted
with
three
smoky
lanterns
where
the
roulette
game
was
above
the
table
was
a
sign
which
read
do
not
get
on
the
roulette
table
with
your
it
was
a
vertical
wheel
not
a
horizontal
one
bristling
with
spikes
which
caught
a
flexible
steel
strip
and
finally
stopped
the
wheel
opposite
a
number
each
way
the
table
extended
twelve
feet
always
crowded
with
at
least
five
rows
of
small
boys
peons
and
and
gesticulating
tossing
a
rain
of
small
bills
on
the
numbers
and
colors
and
arguing
violently
over
the
winnings
those
who
lost
would
set
up
terrible
screams
of
rage
as
the
croupier
raked
their
money
into
the
drawer
and
often
the
wheel
was
quiet
for
of
an
hour
while
some
player
who
had
lost
ten
cents
exhausted
his
vocabulary
upon
the
treasurer
the
owner
of
the
place
and
his
ancestors
and
descendants
ten
generations
each
way
and
upon
god
and
his
family
for
allowing
such
injustice
to
go
unpunished
finally
he
would
take
himself
off
muttering
ominously
we
shall
see
while
the
others
would
sympathetically
make
way
for
him
murmuring
que
mala
suerte
near
where
the
croupier
sat
was
a
worn
place
in
the
cloth
with
a
small
ivory
button
in
the
center
and
when
anyone
was
winning
largely
at
the
wheel
the
croupier
would
press
this
little
button
which
stopped
the
wheel
where
he
wished
until
the
winner
was
discouraged
from
playing
further
this
was
looked
upon
as
perfectly
legitimate
by
all
present
since
there
is
no
sense
in
operating
a
gambling
house
at
a
loss
the
most
amazing
diversity
of
money
was
used
silver
and
copper
had
long
since
been
forced
out
of
circulation
in
chihuahua
because
of
revolutionary
hard
times
but
there
were
still
some
mexican
besides
those
there
was
money
printed
on
ordinary
by
the
constitutionalist
army
and
worth
nothing
scrip
issued
by
the
mining
companies
s
notes
of
hand
mortgages
and
a
hundred
different
of
various
railroads
plantations
and
public
service
corporations
but
the
roulette
table
did
not
long
interest
us
there
was
not
enough
action
for
your
money
so
we
shouldered
our
way
into
a
small
room
blue
with
smoke
where
a
perpetual
poker
game
was
going
at
a
table
at
a
little
recess
at
the
straight
side
of
the
table
sat
the
dealer
chairs
were
distributed
around
the
circumference
where
the
players
sat
one
played
against
the
bank
the
dealer
scraping
into
the
drawer
a
tenth
of
every
house
s
commission
whenever
anyone
began
to
plunge
and
displayed
a
large
wad
the
dealer
would
give
a
shrill
penetrating
whistle
and
two
suave
gentlemen
who
were
employed
by
the
house
would
come
running
and
take
a
hand
there
was
no
limit
as
long
as
you
had
chips
or
if
your
stack
was
underlaid
with
the
gentleman
in
possession
of
the
buck
had
the
say
whether
it
was
to
be
draw
poker
or
stud
stud
was
the
most
fun
because
a
mexican
could
never
realize
that
the
next
card
would
not
give
him
a
magnificent
hand
and
he
bet
increasing
amounts
on
every
card
with
wildly
growing
excitement
the
strict
rules
of
the
american
game
which
so
restrict
freedom
of
action
were
absent
here
johnny
and
i
would
lift
a
corner
of
our
cards
as
soon
as
they
were
dealt
to
show
each
other
and
when
i
seemed
to
be
drawing
ahead
johnny
would
impulsively
push
his
whole
stack
over
to
me
with
the
next
card
johnny
s
hand
would
seem
to
have
more
promise
than
mine
and
i
would
push
both
stacks
back
to
him
by
the
time
the
last
card
was
dealt
all
the
chips
would
be
laying
neutrally
between
us
and
whoever
had
the
best
hand
bet
our
entire
joint
capital
of
course
nobody
objected
to
this
way
of
playing
but
to
offset
it
the
dealer
would
whistle
shrilly
to
the
two
house
players
and
slyly
deal
them
each
a
hand
off
the
bottom
of
the
pack
meanwhile
a
chinaman
would
be
dashing
madly
between
the
table
and
a
across
the
street
bearing
sandwiches
con
and
cups
of
coffee
to
the
players
who
ate
and
drank
loudly
during
the
game
and
spilled
coffee
and
food
into
the
occasionally
some
player
who
had
traveled
extensively
in
foreign
lands
got
up
and
walked
around
his
chair
to
dispel
a
run
of
bad
luck
or
asked
for
a
new
deck
with
an
expensive
air
the
dealer
would
bow
politely
sweep
the
deck
into
his
drawer
and
produce
another
one
he
had
only
two
decks
of
cards
in
the
house
both
were
about
a
year
old
and
largely
decorated
with
the
meals
of
former
players
of
course
the
american
game
was
played
but
there
would
sometimes
enter
a
mexican
who
was
not
intimately
acquainted
with
the
subtleties
of
the
american
deck
in
the
mexican
deck
for
example
the
seven
eight
and
nine
spots
are
omitted
one
such
person
a
pompous
pretentious
mexican
sat
in
one
night
just
as
i
had
called
for
a
hand
of
stud
before
the
dealer
could
whistle
the
stranger
had
produced
a
great
wad
of
sorts
sizes
and
denominations
and
bought
one
hundred
pesos
worth
of
chips
the
game
was
on
i
drew
three
hearts
in
rapid
succession
secured
roberts
pile
and
began
to
play
for
a
flush
the
stranger
gazed
at
his
cards
for
a
long
time
as
if
they
were
new
to
him
then
he
flushed
the
deep
red
of
intense
excitement
and
pushed
in
fifteen
dollars
with
the
succeeding
card
he
turned
quite
pale
and
pushed
in
dollars
and
when
he
looked
at
his
last
card
he
turned
red
again
and
bet
fifty
dollars
by
some
miracle
i
had
filled
a
flush
but
the
man
s
wild
betting
scared
me
i
knew
that
a
flush
was
good
for
almost
anything
in
stud
poker
but
i
couldn
t
keep
up
with
that
pace
so
i
passed
the
bet
to
him
he
rose
at
that
and
protested
violently
how
do
you
mean
pass
the
bet
he
cried
shaking
both
fists
it
was
explained
to
him
and
he
subsided
very
well
then
he
said
since
this
fifteen
dollars
is
all
i
have
and
you
will
not
let
me
buy
any
more
chips
i
will
bet
everything
and
he
pushed
it
into
the
center
i
called
him
what
have
you
got
he
almost
screamed
leaning
trembling
over
the
table
i
spread
out
my
flush
with
an
excited
laugh
he
banged
the
table
a
great
blow
straight
he
turned
up
four
five
six
ten
jack
he
had
already
reached
out
an
arm
to
gather
in
the
money
when
the
entire
table
burst
into
a
clamor
it
is
wrong
it
is
not
a
straight
the
money
belongs
to
the
gringo
he
lay
sprawled
out
on
the
table
with
both
arms
round
the
pot
how
he
cried
sharply
looking
up
it
is
not
a
straight
look
five
six
ten
knave
the
dealer
interposed
but
it
should
have
been
four
five
six
seven
eight
he
said
in
the
american
pack
there
are
seven
eight
and
nine
how
ridiculous
sneered
the
man
i
have
played
cards
all
my
life
and
never
never
have
i
seen
a
seven
eight
or
nine
by
this
time
most
of
the
roulette
table
throng
had
swarmed
in
at
the
door
they
added
their
clamor
to
ours
of
course
it
is
not
a
straight
of
course
it
must
be
is
there
not
four
five
six
ten
knave
but
the
american
pack
is
different
but
this
is
not
the
united
states
this
is
mexico
hey
pancho
shouted
the
dealer
go
at
once
and
notify
the
police
the
situation
remained
the
same
my
opponent
still
lay
upon
the
table
with
the
in
his
arms
a
perfect
pandemonium
of
argument
filled
the
place
in
some
cases
it
had
developed
a
personal
note
and
hands
were
stealing
to
hips
i
unobtrusively
pushed
my
chair
against
the
wall
presently
the
chief
of
police
arrived
with
four
or
five
gendarmes
he
was
a
large
unshaven
man
whose
mustaches
twisted
up
to
his
eyes
dressed
in
a
loose
dirty
uniform
with
red
plush
epaulettes
as
he
came
in
everybody
began
explaining
to
him
at
once
the
dealer
made
a
megaphone
out
of
his
hands
and
shouted
through
the
din
the
man
on
the
table
turned
up
a
livid
face
insisting
shrilly
that
it
was
an
outrage
for
gringo
rules
to
spoil
a
perfectly
good
mexican
game
like
stud
poker
the
chief
listened
curling
his
mustaches
his
chest
swelling
with
the
importance
of
being
the
deciding
factor
in
an
argument
involving
such
large
sums
of
money
he
looked
at
me
i
said
nothing
but
bowed
politely
he
returned
the
bow
then
turning
to
his
policeman
he
pointed
a
dramatic
finger
at
the
man
at
the
table
arrest
this
goat
he
said
it
was
a
fitting
climax
shrieking
and
protesting
the
unfortunate
mexican
was
led
into
a
corner
where
he
stood
facing
the
table
the
money
belongs
to
this
gentleman
continued
the
chief
of
police
as
for
you
you
evidently
do
not
understand
the
rudiments
of
this
game
i
have
a
mind
perhaps
said
roberts
politely
nudging
me
the
señor
captain
would
like
to
show
the
gentleman
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
loan
him
a
few
chips
i
added
raking
in
the
pile
said
the
chief
i
will
be
glad
to
do
so
superlative
thanks
sir
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
out
of
politeness
the
buck
was
given
to
him
he
said
with
the
air
of
an
old
hand
we
played
the
chief
of
police
won
he
rattled
his
chips
like
a
professional
gambler
slapping
the
buck
to
his
neighbor
and
we
played
again
you
see
said
the
chief
of
police
it
is
easy
if
you
observe
the
rules
he
twisted
his
mustache
ruffled
the
cards
and
pushed
in
dollars
he
won
again
after
some
time
one
of
the
policemen
approached
him
respectfully
and
said
i
beg
you
pardon
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
prisoner
oh
said
the
chief
staring
he
waved
his
hand
casually
just
release
him
and
return
to
your
stations
long
after
the
last
wheel
had
been
spun
on
the
roulette
table
the
lamps
blown
out
and
the
most
feverish
gambler
ejected
into
the
street
we
sat
playing
in
the
poker
room
roberts
and
i
were
down
to
about
three
pesos
apiece
we
yawned
and
nodded
with
sleepiness
but
the
chief
of
police
had
his
coat
off
and
was
crouched
like
a
tiger
over
his
cards
now
he
was
losing
steadily
it
happened
to
be
the
day
of
a
fiesta
and
of
course
nobody
worked
in
valle
allegre
the
was
to
take
place
at
high
noon
in
the
open
space
back
of
catarino
cabrera
s
drinking
directly
in
front
of
dionysio
aguirre
s
where
the
long
burro
rest
on
their
mountain
journeys
and
the
muleteers
swap
tales
over
their
at
one
the
sunny
side
of
the
dry
arroyo
that
is
called
a
street
was
lined
with
double
rows
of
squatting
dreamily
sucking
their
cigarettes
as
they
waited
the
bibulously
inclined
drifted
in
and
out
of
catarino
s
whence
came
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
and
a
strong
reek
of
small
boys
played
with
a
large
yellow
sow
and
on
opposite
sides
of
the
arroyo
the
competing
roosters
tethered
by
the
leg
crew
defiantly
one
of
the
owners
an
ingratiating
professional
wearing
sandals
and
one
cerise
sock
stalked
around
with
a
handful
of
dirty
shouting
señores
only
ten
dollars
it
was
strange
nobody
seemed
too
poor
to
bet
ten
dollars
it
came
on
toward
two
o
clock
and
still
no
one
moved
except
to
follow
the
sun
a
few
feet
as
it
swung
the
black
edge
of
the
shadow
eastward
the
shadow
was
very
cold
and
the
sun
white
hot
on
the
edge
of
the
shadow
lay
ignacio
the
violinist
wrapped
in
a
tattered
serape
sleeping
off
a
drunk
he
can
play
one
tune
when
s
when
very
drunk
he
also
remembers
fragments
of
mendelssohn
s
spring
song
in
fact
he
is
the
only
musician
in
the
whole
state
of
durango
and
possesses
a
just
celebrity
ignacio
used
to
be
brilliant
and
sons
and
daughters
are
the
artistic
temperament
was
too
much
for
him
the
color
of
the
street
was
rich
red
the
open
space
where
the
burros
stood
olive
drab
there
were
brown
crumbling
adobe
walls
and
squat
houses
their
roofs
heaped
high
with
yellow
cornstalks
or
hung
with
strings
of
red
peppers
a
gigantic
green
mesquite
tree
with
roots
like
a
chicken
s
foot
thatched
on
every
branch
with
dried
hay
and
corn
below
the
town
fell
steeply
down
the
arroyo
roofs
tumbled
together
like
blocks
with
flowers
and
grass
growing
on
them
blue
feathers
of
smoke
waving
from
the
chimneys
and
occasional
palms
sticking
up
between
they
fell
away
to
the
yellow
plain
where
the
are
run
and
beyond
that
the
barren
mountains
crouched
tawny
as
lions
then
faintly
blue
then
purple
and
wrinkled
notched
and
jagged
across
the
fierce
bright
sky
straight
down
and
away
through
the
arroyo
one
saw
a
great
valley
like
an
elephant
s
hide
where
the
a
lazy
smoke
of
human
noises
floated
up
roosters
crowing
pigs
grunting
burros
giving
great
racking
sobs
the
rustling
crackle
of
dried
being
shaken
out
of
the
mesquite
tree
a
woman
singing
as
she
mashed
her
corn
on
the
stones
the
wailing
of
a
myriad
of
babies
the
sun
fairly
blistered
my
friend
atanacio
sat
upon
the
sidewalk
thinking
of
nothing
his
dirty
feet
were
bare
except
for
sandals
his
mighty
sombrero
was
of
a
faded
dull
brick
color
embroidered
with
tarnished
gold
braid
and
his
serape
was
of
the
pottery
blue
one
sees
in
chinese
rugs
and
decorated
with
yellow
suns
he
rose
when
he
saw
me
we
removed
our
hats
and
embraced
after
the
mexican
fashion
patting
each
other
on
the
back
with
one
hand
while
we
shook
the
other
tardes
amigo
he
murmured
how
do
you
seat
yourself
very
well
much
thanks
and
you
how
have
they
treated
you
delicious
superlative
thanks
i
have
longed
to
see
you
again
and
your
family
how
are
they
it
is
considered
more
delicate
in
mexico
not
to
ask
about
one
s
wife
because
so
few
people
are
married
their
health
is
of
the
best
great
great
thanks
and
your
family
i
saw
your
son
with
the
army
at
jimenez
he
gave
me
many
many
remembrances
of
you
would
you
desire
a
cigarette
thanks
permit
me
a
light

in
valle
allegre
many
days
for
the
fiesta
only
señor
i
hope

visit
is
fortunate
señor
my
house

at
your
orders
thanks
how
is
it
that
i
did
not
see
you
at
the
last
night
señor
you
who
were
always
such
a
sympathetic
dancer
unhappily
juanita
is
gone
to
visit
her
mother
in
el
oro
and
now
therefore
i
am
a
i
grow
too
old
for
the
señoritas
ah
no
señor
a
of
your
age
is
in
the
prime
of
life
but
tell
me
is
it
true
what
i
hear
that
the
maderistas
are
now
at
mapimi
señor
soon
villa
will
take
torreon
they
say
and
then
it
is
only
a
matter
of
a
few
months
before
the
revolution
is
accomplished
i
think
that
yes
but
tell
me
i
have
great
respect
for
your
opinion
which
cock
would
you
advise
me
to
bet
on
we
approached
the
combatants
and
looked
them
over
while
their
owners
clamored
in
our
ears
they
sat
upon
the
curbing
negligently
herding
their
birds
apart
it
was
getting
toward
three
of
the
afternoon
but
will
there
be
a
i
asked
them
sabe
drawled
one
the
other
murmured
that
possibly
it
would
be
it
developed
that
the
steel
spurs
had
been
forgotten
in
el
oro
and
that
a
small
boy
had
gone
after
them
on
a
burro
it
was
six
miles
over
the
mountains
to
el
oro
however
no
one
was
in
any
hurry
so
we
sat
down
also
appeared
then
catarino
cabrera
the
saloon
keeper
and
also
the
constitutionalist
politico
of
valle
allegre
very
drunk
walking
arm
in
arm
with
don
priciliano
saucedes
the
former
under
the
diaz
government
don
priciliano
is
a
old
castilian
who
used
to
lend
money
to
the
peons
at
twenty
per
cent
don
catarino
is
a
former
schoolmaster
an
ardent
lends
money
at
a
slightly
less
rate
of
usury
to
the
same
parties
don
catarino
wears
no
collar
but
he
sports
a
revolver
and
two
don
priciliano
during
the
first
revolution
was
deprived
of
most
of
his
property
by
the
maderistas
of
the
town
and
then
strapped
naked
upon
his
horse
and
beaten
upon
his
bare
back
with
the
flat
of
a
sword
aie
he
says
to
my
question
the
revolution
i
have
most
of
the
revolution
upon
my
back
and
the
two
pass
on
to
don
priciliano
s
house
where
catarino
is
courting
a
beautiful
daughter
then
with
the
thunder
of
hoofs
dashes
up
the
gay
and
gallant
young
jesus
triano
who
was
a
captain
under
orozco
but
valle
allegre
is
a
three
days
ride
from
the
railroad
and
politics
are
not
a
burning
issue
there
so
jesus
rides
his
stolen
horse
with
impunity
around
the
streets
he
is
a
large
young
man
with
shining
teeth
a
rifle
and
bandolier
and
leather
trousers
fastened
up
the
side
with
buttons
as
big
as
spurs
are
twice
as
big
they
say
that
his
dashing
ways
and
the
fact
that
he
shot
emetario
flores
in
the
back
have
won
him
the
hand
of
dolores
youngest
daughter
of
manuel
paredes
the
charcoal
contractor
he
plunges
down
the
arroyo
at
a
gallop
his
horse
tossing
bloody
froth
from
the
cruel
curb
captain
adolfo
melendez
of
the
constitutionalist
army
slouches
around
the
corner
in
a
new
corduroy
uniform
he
wears
a
handsome
gilded
sword
which
once
belonged
to
the
knights
of
pythias
adolfo
came
to
valle
allegre
on
a
two
weeks
leave
which
he
prolonged
indefinitely
in
order
to
take
to
himself
a
daughter
of
a
village
aristocrat
they
say
that
his
wedding
was
magnificent
beyond
belief
two
priests
officiating
and
the
service
lasting
an
hour
more
than
necessary
but
this
may
have
been
good
economy
on
adolfo
s
part
since
he
already
had
one
wife
in
chihuahua
another
in
farral
and
a
third
in
monterey
and
of
course
had
to
placate
the
parents
of
the
bride
he
had
now
been
away
from
his
regiment
three
months
and
told
me
simply
that
he
thought
they
had
forgotten
all
about
him
by
this
time
at
four
a
thunder
of
cheers
announced
the
arrival
of
the
small
boy
with
the
steel
spurs
it
seems
that
he
had
got
into
a
card
game
at
el
oro
and
had
temporarily
forgotten
his
errand
but
of
course
nothing
was
said
about
it
he
had
arrived
which
was
the
important
thing
we
formed
a
wide
ring
in
the
open
space
where
the
burros
stood
and
the
two
owners
began
to
throw
their
birds
but
at
the
first
onslaught
the
fowl
upon
which
we
had
all
bet
our
money
spread
its
wings
and
to
the
astonishment
of
the
assembled
company
soared
screaming
over
the
mesquite
tree
and
disappeared
toward
the
mountains
ten
minutes
later
the
two
owners
unconcernedly
divided
the
proceeds
before
our
eyes
and
we
strolled
home
well
content
fidencio
and
i
dined
at
charlie
chee
s
hotel
throughout
mexico
in
every
little
town
you
will
find
chinamen
monopolizing
the
hotel
and
restaurant
business
charlie
and
his
cousin
foo
were
both
married
to
the
daughters
of
respectable
mexican
villagers
no
one
seemed
to
think
that
strange
mexicans
appear
to
have
no
race
prejudices
whatever
captain
adolfo
in
a
bright
yellow
khaki
uniform
and
another
sword
brought
his
bride
a
faintly
pretty
brown
girl
with
her
hair
in
a
bang
wearing
chandelier
lusters
as
earrings
charlie
banged
down
in
front
of
each
of
us
a
quart
bottle
of
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
flirted
politely
with
señora
melendez
while
foo
served
dinner
enlivened
with
gay
social
chatter
in
pidgin
mexican
it
seemed
that
there
was
to
be
a
at
don
priciliano
s
that
evening
and
charlie
politely
offered
to
teach
adolfo
s
wife
a
new
step
which
he
had
learned
in
el
paso
called
the
turkey
trot
this
he
did
until
adolfo
began
to
look
sullen
and
announced
that
he
didn
t
think
he
would
go
to
don
priciliano
s
since
he
considered
it
a
bad
thing
for
young
wives
to
be
seen
much
in
public
charlie
and
foo
also
tendered
their
regrets
because
several
of
their
countrymen
were
due
in
the
village
that
evening
from
parral
and
said
that
they
would
of
course
want
to
raise
a
little
chinese
hell
together
so
fidencio
and
i
finally
departed
after
solemnly
promising
that
we
would
return
in
time
for
the
chinese
festivities
after
the
dance
outside
strong
moonlight
flooded
all
the
village
the
jumbled
roofs
were
so
many
silvery
planes
and
the
glistened
like
a
frozen
cataract
the
arroyo
fell
away
and
the
great
valley
beyond
lay
drowned
in
rich
soft
mist
the
quickened
in
the
laughter
of
young
girls
a
woman
catching
her
breath
at
a
window
to
the
swift
hot
torrent
of
a
man
s
speech
as
he
leaned
against
the
bars
a
dozen
guitars
syncopating
each
other
a
young
buck
hurrying
to
meet
his
spurs
ringing
clear
it
was
cold
as
we
passed
cabrera
s
door
a
hot
smoky
alcoholic
breath
smote
us
beyond
that
you
crossed
on
the
stream
where
the
women
wash
their
clothes
climbing
the
other
bank
we
saw
the
brilliant
windows
of
don
priciliano
s
house
and
heard
the
far
strains
of
valle
allegre
s
orchestra
open
doors
and
windows
were
choked
with
dark
silent
peons
wrapped
to
the
eyes
in
their
blankets
staring
at
the
dance
with
eager
and
solemn
eyes
a
forest
of
sombreros
now
fidencio
had
just
returned
to
valle
allegre
after
a
long
absence
and
as
we
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
group
a
tall
young
fellow
caught
sight
of
him
and
whirling
his
serape
like
a
wing
he
embraced
my
friend
crying
happy
return
fidencio
we
looked
for
you
many
months
the
crowd
swayed
and
rocked
like
a
windy
wheat
field
blankets
flapped
dark
against
the
night
they
took
up
the
cry
fidencio
fidencio
is
here
your
carmencita
is
inside
fidencio
you
had
better
look
out
for
your
sweetheart
you
can
t
stay
away
as
long
as
that
and
expect
her
to
remain
faithful
to
you
those
inside
caught
the
cry
and
echoed
it
and
the
dance
which
had
just
begun
stopped
suddenly
the
peons
formed
a
lane
through
which
we
passed
patting
us
on
the
back
with
little
words
of
welcome
and
affection
and
at
the
door
a
dozen
friends
crowded
forward
to
hug
us
faces
alight
with
pleasure
carmencita
a
dumpy
small
indian
girl
dressed
in
a
screaming
blue
dress
that
didn
t
fit
stood
over
near
the
corner
by
the
side
of
a
certain
pablito
her
partner
a
youth
about
sixteen
years
old
with
a
bad
complexion
she
affected
to
pay
no
attention
to
fidencio
s
arrival
but
stood
dumbly
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
as
is
proper
for
unmarried
mexican
women
fidencio
swaggered
among
his
in
true
manly
fashion
for
a
few
minutes
interspersing
his
conversation
with
loud
virile
oaths
then
in
a
lordly
manner
he
went
straight
across
the
room
to
carmencita
placed
her
left
hand
within
the
hollow
of
his
right
arm
and
cried
well
now
let
s
dance
and
the
grinning
perspiring
musicians
nodded
and
fell
to
there
were
five
of
violins
a
cornet
a
flute
and
a
harp
they
swung
into
tres
piedras
and
the
couples
fell
in
line
marching
solemnly
round
the
room
after
parading
round
twice
they
fell
to
dancing
hopping
awkwardly
over
the
rough
hard
floor
with
jingling
spurs
when
they
had
danced
around
the
room
two
or
three
times
they
walked
again
then
danced
then
walked
then
danced
so
that
each
number
took
about
an
hour
it
was
a
long
low
room
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
beamed
ceiling
wattled
with
mud
above
and
at
one
end
was
the
inevitable
closed
now
and
converted
into
a
sort
of
an
altar
by
a
tiny
embroidered
cloth
upon
which
burned
a
perpetual
rush
flame
before
a
tawdry
color
print
of
the
virgin
which
hung
on
the
wall
don
priciliano
and
his
wife
who
was
nursing
a
baby
at
her
breast
beamed
from
chairs
at
the
other
end
innumerable
candles
had
been
heated
on
one
side
and
stuck
against
the
wall
all
around
whence
they
trailed
sooty
snakes
above
them
on
the
white
the
men
made
a
prodigious
stamping
and
clinking
as
they
danced
shouting
boisterously
to
one
another
the
women
kept
their
eyes
on
the
floor
and
did
not
speak
i
caught
sight
of
the
pimply
youth
glowering
with
folded
arms
upon
fidencio
from
his
corner
and
as
i
stood
by
the
door
fragments
of
the
peons
conversation
floated
in
to
me
fidencio
should
not
have
stayed
away
so
long
see
the
way
pablito
scowls
there
he
thought
surely
fidencio
was
dead
and
that
carmencita
was
his
own
and
then
a
hopeful
voice
perhaps
there
will
be
trouble
the
dance
finally
ended
and
fidencio
led
his
betrothed
correctly
back
to
her
seat
against
the
wall
the
music
stopped
the
men
poured
out
into
the
night
where
in
the
flare
of
a
torch
the
owner
of
the
losing
rooster
sold
bottles
of
strong
drink
we
toasted
each
other
boisterously
in
the
sharp
dark
the
mountains
around
stood
dazzling
in
the
moon
and
then
for
the
intervals
between
dances
were
very
short
we
heard
the
music
erupt
again
volcanically
and
exuberantly
into
a
waltz
the
center
of
twenty
curious
and
enthusiastic
he
had
strutted
back
into
the
room
he
went
straight
to
carmencita
but
as
he
led
her
out
upon
the
floor
pablito
glided
up
behind
pulling
out
a
large
obsolete
revolver
a
dozen
shouts
rang
fidencio
look
out
he
whirled
to
see
the
revolver
pointed
at
his
stomach
for
a
moment
no
one
moved
fidencio
and
his
rival
looked
at
each
other
with
wrathful
eyes
there
was
a
subdued
clicking
of
automatics
everywhere
as
the
gentlemen
drew
and
cocked
their
weapons
for
some
of
them
were
friends
of
pablito
s
i
heard
low
voices
muttering
porfirio
go
home
and
get
my
shotgun
victoriano
my
new
rifle
it
lies
on
the
bureau
in
mother
s
room
a
shoal
of
small
boys
like
scattered
through
the
moonlight
to
get
firearms
meanwhile
the
was
preserved
the
peons
had
squatted
out
of
the
range
of
fire
so
that
just
their
eyes
showed
above
the
where
they
watched
proceedings
with
joyous
interest
most
of
the
musicians
were
edging
toward
the
nearest
window
the
harpist
however
had
dropped
down
behind
his
instrument
don
priciliano
and
his
wife
still
nursing
the
infant
rose
and
majestically
made
their
way
to
some
interior
part
of
the
house
it
was
none
of
their
business
besides
they
did
not
wish
to
interfere
with
the
young
folks
pleasure
with
one
arm
fidencio
carefully
pushed
carmencita
away
holding
his
other
hand
poised
like
a
claw
in
the
dead
silence
he
said
you
little
goat
don
t
stand
there
pointing
that
thing
at
me
if
you
re
afraid
to
shoot
it
pull
the
trigger
while
i
am
unarmed
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
even
at
the
hand
of
a
weak
little
fool
who
doesn
t
know
when
to
use
a
gun
the
boy
s
face
twisted
hatefully
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
shoot
ah
murmured
the
peons
now
now
is
the
time
but
he
didn
t
after
a
few
minutes
his
hand
wavered
and
with
a
curse
he
jammed
the
pistol
back
into
his
pocket
the
peons
straightened
up
again
and
crowded
disappointedly
around
the
doors
and
windows
the
harpist
got
up
and
began
to
tune
his
harp
there
was
much
thrusting
back
of
revolvers
into
holsters
and
the
sprightly
social
conversation
grew
up
again
by
the
time
the
small
boys
arrived
with
a
perfect
arsenal
of
rifles
and
shotguns
the
dance
had
been
resumed
so
the
guns
were
stacked
in
a
corner
as
long
as
carmencita
claimed
his
amorous
attention
and
there
was
a
prospect
of
friction
fidencio
stayed
he
swaggered
among
the
men
and
basked
in
the
admiration
of
the
ladies
outdancing
them
all
in
speed
abandon
and
noise
but
he
soon
tired
of
that
and
the
excitement
of
meeting
carmencita
palled
upon
him
so
he
went
out
into
the
moonlight
again
and
up
the
arroyo
to
take
part
in
charlie
chee
s
celebration
as
we
approached
the
hotel
we
were
conscious
of
a
curious
low
moaning
sound
which
seemed
akin
to
music
the
had
been
removed
from
the
into
the
street
and
around
the
room
foo
and
another
celestial
a
barrel
of
had
been
set
up
on
a
trestle
in
one
corner
and
beneath
it
sprawled
charlie
himself
in
his
mouth
a
glass
tube
which
syphoned
up
into
the
barrel
a
tremendous
wooden
box
of
mexican
cigarettes
had
been
smashed
open
on
one
side
the
packages
tumbling
out
upon
the
floor
in
other
parts
of
the
room
two
more
chinamen
slept
the
profound
sleep
of
the
very
drunk
wrapped
in
blankets
the
two
who
danced
sang
meanwhile
their
own
version
of
a
once
popular
ragtime
song
called
dreamy
eyes
against
this
marched
magnificently
the
pilgrim
s
chorus
from
tannhäuser
rendered
by
a
phonograph
set
up
in
the
kitchen
charlie
removed
the
glass
tube
from
his
mouth
put
a
thumb
over
it
and
welcomed
us
with
a
hymn
which
he
sang
as
follows
pooll
for
the
shore
sailor
for
the
shore
not
the
lowling
pooll
for
the
shore
he
surveyed
us
with
a
bleary
eye
and
remarked
bledlau
je
calist
is
wid
us
here
toni
after
which
he
returned
the
syphon
to
his
mouth
we
blended
into
these
festivities
fidencio
offered
to
exhibit
the
steps
of
a
new
spanish
the
way
it
was
danced
by
the
damned
grasshoppers
as
mexicans
call
the
spaniards
he
stamped
bellowing
around
the
room
colliding
with
the
chinamen
and
roaring
la
paloma
finally
out
of
breath
he
collapsed
upon
a
nearby
chair
and
began
to
descant
upon
the
many
charms
of
adolfo
s
bride
whom
he
had
seen
for
the
first
time
that
day
he
declared
that
it
was
a
shame
for
so
young
and
blithe
a
spirit
to
be
tied
to
a
man
he
said
that
he
himself
represented
youth
strength
and
gallantry
and
was
a
much
more
fitting
mate
for
her
he
added
that
as
the
evening
advanced
he
found
that
he
desired
her
more
and
more
charlie
chee
with
the
glass
tube
in
his
mouth
nodded
intelligently
at
each
of
these
statements
i
had
a
happy
thought
why
not
send
for
adolfo
and
his
wife
and
invite
them
to
join
our
festivities
the
chinamen
asleep
on
the
floor
were
kicked
awake
and
their
opinion
asked
since
they
could
understand
neither
spanish
nor
english
they
answered
fluently
in
chinese
fidencio
translated
they
say
he
said
that
charlie
ought
to
be
sent
with
the
invitation
we
agreed
to
that
charlie
rose
while
foo
took
his
place
at
the
glass
tube
he
declared
that
he
would
invite
them
in
the
most
irresistible
terms
and
strapping
on
his
revolver
disappeared
ten
minutes
later
we
heard
five
shots
we
discussed
the
matter
at
length
not
understanding
why
there
should
be
any
artillery
at
that
time
of
night
except
that
probably
two
guests
returning
from
the
were
murdering
each
other
before
going
to
bed
charlie
took
a
long
time
in
the
meanwhile
and
we
were
just
considering
the
advisability
of
sending
out
an
expedition
to
find
him
when
he
returned
well
how
about
it
charlie
i
asked
will
they
come
i
don
t
think
so
he
replied
doubtfully
swaying
in
the
doorway
did
you
hear
the
shooting
asked
fidencio
yes
very
close
said
charlie
foo
if
you
will
kindly
get
out
from
under
that
tube
what
was
it
we
asked
well
said
charlie
i
knocked
at
adolfo
s
door
and
said
we
were
having
a
party
down
here
and
wanted
him
to
come
he
shot
at
me
three
times
and
i
shot
at
him
twice
so
saying
charlie
seized
foo
by
the
leg
and
composedly
lay
down
under
the
glass
tube
again
we
must
have
stayed
there
some
hours
after
that
i
remember
that
toward
morning
ignacio
came
in
and
played
us
tosti
s
to
which
all
the
chinamen
danced
solemnly
around
at
about
four
o
clock
atanacio
appeared
he
burst
open
the
door
and
stood
there
very
white
with
a
gun
in
one
hand
friends
he
said
a
most
disagreeable
thing
has
happened
my
wife
juanita
returned
from
her
mother
s
about
midnight
on
an
ass
she
was
stopped
on
the
road
by
a
man
muffled
up
in
a
who
gave
her
an
anonymous
letter
in
which
were
detailed
all
my
little
amusements
when
i
last
went
for
recreation
to
juarez
i
have
seen
the
letter
it
is
astonishingly
accurate
it
tells
how
i
went
to
supper
with
maria
and
then
home
with
her
it
tells
how
i
took
ana
to
the
it
describes
the
hair
complexion
and
disposition
of
all
those
other
ladies
and
how
much
money
i
spent
upon
them
it
is
exact
to
a
cent
when
she
got
home
i
happened
to
be
down
at
catarino
s
taking
a
cup
with
an
old
friend
this
mysterious
stranger
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
with
another
letter
in
which
he
said
i
had
three
more
wives
in
chihuahua
which
god
knows
is
not
true
since
i
only
have
one
it
is
not
that
i
care
amigos
but
these
things
have
upset
juanita
horribly
of
course
i
denied
these
charges
but
women
are
so
unreasonable
i
hired
dionysio
to
watch
my
house
but
he
has
gone
to
the
and
so
arousing
and
dressing
my
small
son
that
he
may
carry
me
word
of
any
further
outrages
i
have
come
down
to
seek
your
help
in
preserving
my
home
from
this
disgrace
we
declared
ourselves
willing
to
do
anything
for
that
is
that
promised
excitement
we
said
that
it
was
horrible
that
the
evil
stranger
ought
to
be
exterminated
who
could
it
be
atanacio
replied
that
it
was
probably
flores
who
had
had
a
baby
by
his
wife
before
he
married
her
but
who
had
never
succeeded
in
quite
capturing
her
affections
we
forced
upon
him
and
he
drank
moodily
charlie
chee
was
pried
loose
from
the
glass
tube
where
foo
took
his
place
and
sent
for
weapons
and
in
ten
minutes
he
returned
with
seven
loaded
revolvers
of
different
makes
almost
immediately
came
a
furious
pounding
on
the
door
and
atanacio
s
young
son
flung
himself
in
papa
he
cried
holding
out
a
paper
here
is
another
one
the
man
knocked
at
the
back
door
and
when
mamma
went
to
find
out
who
it
was
she
could
only
see
a
big
red
blanket
covering
him
entirely
up
to
the
hair
he
gave
her
a
note
and
ran
away
taking
a
loaf
of
bread
off
the
window
with
trembling
hands
atanacio
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
aloud
your
husband
is
the
father
of
small
children
in
the
state
of
coahuila
signed
some
one
who
knows
him
mother
of
god
cried
atanacio
springing
to
his
feet
in
a
transport
of
grief
and
rage
it
is
a
lie
i
have
always
discriminated
forward
my
friends
let
us
protect
our
homes
seizing
our
revolvers
we
rushed
out
into
the
night
we
staggered
panting
up
the
steep
hill
to
atanacio
s
close
together
so
no
one
would
be
mistaken
by
the
others
for
the
mysterious
stranger
atanacio
s
wife
was
lying
on
the
bed
weeping
hysterically
we
scattered
into
the
brush
and
poked
into
the
alleys
around
the
house
but
nothing
stirred
in
a
corner
of
the
corral
lay
dionysio
the
watchman
fast
asleep
his
rifle
by
his
side
we
passed
on
up
the
hill
until
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
town
already
dawn
was
coming
a
chorus
of
roosters
made
the
only
sound
except
the
incredibly
soft
music
from
the
at
don
priciliano
s
which
would
probably
last
all
that
day
and
the
next
night
afar
the
big
valley
was
like
a
great
map
quiet
distinct
immense
every
wall
corner
tree
branch
and
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
were
pricked
out
in
the
wonderful
clear
light
of
in
the
distance
over
the
shoulder
of
the
red
mountain
went
a
man
covered
up
in
a
red
serape
aha
cried
atanacio
there
he
goes
and
with
one
accord
we
opened
up
on
the
red
blanket
there
were
five
of
us
and
we
had
six
shots
apiece
they
echoed
fearfully
among
the
houses
and
clapped
from
mountain
to
mountain
reproduced
each
one
a
hundred
times
of
a
sudden
the
village
belched
men
and
women
and
children
they
evidently
thought
that
a
new
revolution
was
beginning
a
very
ancient
crone
came
out
of
a
small
brown
house
on
the
edge
of
the
village
rubbing
her
eyes
she
shouted
what
are
you
shooting
at
we
are
trying
to
kill
that
accursed
man
in
the
red
blanket
who
is
poisoning
our
homes
and
making
valle
allegre
a
place
unfit
for
a
decent
woman
to
live
in
shouted
atanacio
taking
another
shot
the
old
woman
bent
her
bleary
eyes
upon
our
target
but
she
said
gently
that
is
not
a
bad
man
that
s
only
my
son
going
after
the
goats
meanwhile
the
figure
never
even
looking
back
continued
his
placid
way
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
disappeared
the
romance
of
gold
hangs
over
the
mountains
of
northern
durango
like
an
old
perfume
there
it
is
rumored
was
that
mythical
ophir
whence
the
aztecs
and
their
mysterious
predecessors
drew
the
red
gold
that
cortez
found
in
the
treasury
of
moctezuma
before
the
dawn
of
mexican
history
the
indians
scratched
these
barren
hillsides
with
dull
copper
knives
you
can
still
see
the
traces
of
their
workings
and
after
them
the
spaniards
with
flashing
bright
helmets
and
steel
filled
from
these
mountains
the
lofty
of
the
indies
almost
a
thousand
miles
from
the
capital
over
trackless
deserts
and
fierce
stony
mountains
a
tiny
colorful
fringe
of
the
most
brilliant
civilization
in
europe
flung
itself
among
the
canyons
and
high
peaks
of
this
desolate
land
and
so
far
was
it
from
the
seat
of
change
that
long
after
spanish
rule
had
disappeared
from
mexico
forever
it
persisted
here
the
spaniards
enslaved
the
indians
of
the
region
of
course
and
the
narrow
valleys
are
still
sinister
with
legend
almost
anybody
around
santa
maria
del
oro
can
tell
you
stories
of
the
old
days
when
men
were
flogged
to
death
in
the
mines
and
the
spanish
overseers
lived
like
princes
but
they
were
a
hardy
race
these
mountaineers
they
were
always
rebelling
there
is
a
legend
of
how
the
spaniards
finally
discovering
themselves
alone
two
hundred
leagues
from
the
seacoast
in
the
midst
of
an
overwhelmingly
hostile
native
race
attempted
one
night
to
leave
the
mountains
fires
sprang
up
on
the
high
peaks
and
the
mountain
villages
throbbed
to
the
sound
of
drums
somewhere
in
the
narrow
defiles
the
spaniards
disappeared
forever
and
from
that
time
until
certain
foreigners
secured
mining
concessions
there
the
place
had
an
evil
name
the
authority
of
the
mexican
government
barely
reached
it
there
are
two
villages
which
were
the
capitals
of
the
spaniards
in
this
region
and
where
the
spanish
tradition
is
still
strong
inde
and
santa
maria
del
oro
called
el
oro
inde
the
spaniards
romantically
named
from
their
persistent
dream
that
this
new
world
was
india
santa
maria
del
oro
was
called
so
on
the
same
principle
that
one
sung
a
in
honor
of
bloody
gratefulness
to
heaven
for
the
finding
of
red
gold
our
lady
of
the
gold
in
el
oro
one
can
still
see
the
ruins
of
a
call
it
now
vaguely
the
pathetic
little
arched
roofs
of
a
row
of
monkish
cells
built
of
adobe
and
now
fast
crumbling
under
hot
suns
and
torrential
rains
it
partly
surrounds
what
was
once
the
patio
of
the
cloister
and
a
great
mesquite
tree
towers
there
over
the
forgotten
headstone
of
an
ancient
grave
inscribed
with
the
lordly
name
of
doña
isabella
guzman
of
course
everybody
has
entirely
forgotten
who
doña
isabella
was
or
when
she
died
there
still
stands
in
the
public
square
a
fine
old
spanish
church
with
a
beamed
ceiling
and
over
the
door
of
the
tiny
palacio
municipal
is
the
almost
erased
carving
of
the
arms
of
some
ancient
spanish
house
here
is
romance
for
you
but
the
inhabitants
have
no
respect
for
tradition
and
hardly
any
memory
of
the
ancients
who
left
these
monuments
the
exuberant
indian
civilization
has
entirely
obliterated
all
traces
of
the
el
oro
is
noted
as
the
gayest
town
of
all
the
mountain
region
there
are
almost
every
night
and
far
and
near
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
el
oro
is
the
home
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
durango
in
el
oro
too
they
celebrate
feast
days
with
more
ebullience
than
in
other
localities
all
the
and
and
drivers
and
ranchers
for
miles
around
come
there
on
holidays
that
one
generally
means
two
or
three
without
work
since
there
must
be
one
day
for
celebrating
and
at
least
another
for
coming
and
returning
home
and
what
they
have
in
el
oro
once
a
year
on
the
feast
of
the
santos
reyes
they
perform
los
pastores
all
over
this
part
of
the
country
it
is
an
ancient
miracle
play
of
the
kind
that
used
to
take
place
all
over
europe
in
the
renaissance
kind
that
gave
birth
to
elizabethan
drama
and
is
now
extinct
everywhere
in
the
world
it
is
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
from
mother
to
daughter
from
the
remotest
antiquity
it
is
called
luzbel
the
spanish
for
and
depicts
perverse
man
in
the
midst
of
his
deadly
sin
the
great
antagonist
of
souls
and
the
everlasting
mercy
of
god
made
flesh
in
the
child
jesus
in
most
places
there
is
only
one
performance
of
los
pastores
but
in
el
oro
there
are
three
or
four
on
the
night
of
the
santos
reyes
and
others
at
different
times
of
the
year
as
the
spirit
moves
the
or
village
priest
still
trains
the
actors
the
play
takes
place
no
longer
in
the
church
however
it
is
added
to
from
generation
to
generation
sometimes
being
twisted
to
satirize
persons
in
the
village
it
has
become
too
profane
too
realistic
for
the
church
but
still
it
points
the
great
moral
of
medieval
religion
fidencio
and
i
dined
early
on
the
night
of
the
santos
reyes
afterward
he
took
me
along
the
street
to
a
narrow
between
adobe
walls
which
led
through
a
broken
place
into
a
tiny
corral
behind
a
house
hung
with
red
peppers
under
the
legs
of
two
meditative
burros
scurried
dogs
and
chickens
a
pig
or
so
and
a
swarm
of
little
naked
brown
children
a
wrinkled
old
indian
hag
smoking
a
cigarette
made
of
an
entire
squatted
upon
a
wooden
box
upon
our
appearance
she
arose
muttering
toothless
words
of
greeting
lifted
the
lid
of
the
box
and
produced
an
full
of
the
distillery
was
in
the
kitchen
we
paid
her
a
silver
peso
and
circulated
the
jug
among
the
three
of
us
with
many
polite
wishes
for
health
and
prosperity
over
our
heads
the
sunset
sky
yellowed
and
turned
green
and
a
few
large
mountain
stars
blazed
out
we
heard
laughter
and
guitars
from
the
lower
end
of
the
town
and
the
uproarious
shouts
of
the
finishing
their
holiday
strong
the
old
lady
consumed
much
more
than
her
share
oh
mother
said
fidencio
where
are
they
going
to
give
the
pastores
there
are
many
pastores
she
answered
with
a
leer
what
a
year
it
is
for
pastores
there
is
one
in
the
schoolhouse
and
another
back
of
don
pedro
s
and
another
in
the
of
don
mario
and
still
another
in
the
house
of
perdita
who
was
married
to
thomas
redondo
who
was
killed
last
year
in
the
mines
may
god
have
mercy
on
his
soul
which
will
be
the
best
demanded
fidencio
kicking
a
goat
which
was
trying
to
enter
the
kitchen
sabe
she
shrugged
vaguely
were
my
old
bones
not
so
twisted
i
would
go
to
don
pedro
s
but
i
would
be
disappointed
there
are
no
pastores
nowadays
such
as
the
ones
we
used
to
give
when
i
was
a
girl
we
went
then
to
don
pedro
s
down
a
steep
uneven
street
stopped
every
few
feet
by
boisterous
bankrupts
who
wanted
to
know
where
a
man
could
establish
credit
for
liquor
don
pedro
s
was
a
considerable
house
for
he
was
the
village
rich
man
the
open
square
which
his
buildings
enclosed
would
have
been
a
corral
ordinarily
but
don
pedro
could
afford
a
patio
and
it
was
full
of
fragrant
shrubs
and
barrel
cacti
rude
fountain
pouring
from
an
old
iron
pipe
in
the
center
the
entrance
to
this
was
a
narrow
black
archway
in
which
sat
the
town
orchestra
playing
a
pine
torch
was
stuck
by
its
pitch
against
the
outside
wall
and
under
this
a
man
took
up
pieces
for
the
entrance
fee
we
watched
for
some
time
but
nobody
seemed
to
be
paying
anything
a
clamorous
mob
stood
around
him
pleading
special
they
ought
to
get
in
free
one
was
don
pedro
s
cousin
another
his
gardener
a
third
had
married
the
daughter
of
his
by
his
first
marriage
one
woman
insisted
that
she
was
the
mother
of
a
performer
there
were
other
entrances
at
which
no
guardian
stood
and
through
these
when
they
found
themselves
unable
to
cajole
the
gentleman
at
the
main
door
the
crowd
placidly
sifted
we
paid
our
money
amid
an
awed
silence
and
entered
white
burning
moonlight
flooded
the
place
the
patio
sloped
upward
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
where
there
was
no
wall
to
stop
the
view
of
great
planes
of
shining
upland
tilted
to
meet
the
shallow
jade
sky
to
the
low
roof
of
the
house
a
canopy
of
canvas
drooped
out
over
a
flat
place
supported
by
slanting
poles
like
the
pavilion
of
a
bedouin
king
its
shadow
cut
the
moonlight
blacker
than
night
six
torches
stuck
in
the
ground
around
the
outside
of
the
place
sent
up
thin
lines
of
pitchy
smoke
there
was
no
other
light
under
the
canopy
except
the
restless
gleams
of
innumerable
cigarettes
along
the
wall
of
the
house
stood
women
with
black
mantillas
over
their
heads
the
squatting
at
their
feet
wherever
there
was
space
between
their
knees
were
children
men
and
women
alike
smoked
their
cigarros
handing
them
placidly
down
so
that
the
little
ones
might
take
a
puff
it
was
a
quiet
audience
speaking
little
and
softly
perfectly
content
to
wait
watching
the
moonlight
in
the
patio
and
listening
to
the
music
which
sounded
far
away
in
the
arch
a
nightingale
burst
into
song
somewhere
among
the
shrubs
and
all
of
us
fell
ecstatically
silent
listening
to
it
small
boys
were
dispatched
to
tell
the
band
to
stop
while
the
song
went
on
that
was
very
exciting
during
all
this
time
there
was
no
sign
whatever
of
the
performers
i
don
t
know
how
long
we
sat
there
but
nobody
made
any
comment
on
the
fact
the
audience
was
not
there
primarily
to
see
the
pastores
it
was
there
to
see
and
hear
whatever
took
place
and
everything
interested
it
but
being
a
restless
practical
westerner
alas
i
broke
the
charmed
silence
to
ask
a
woman
next
to
me
when
the
play
would
begin
who
knows
she
answered
tranquilly
a
newcomer
after
turning
my
question
and
the
answer
over
in
his
mind
leaned
across
perhaps
he
said
i
noticed
that
the
band
was
playing
no
longer
it
appears
he
continued
that
there
are
other
pastores
at
doña
perdita
s
house
they
tell
me
that
those
who
were
to
have
performed
here
have
gone
up
there
to
see
them
and
the
musicians
have
also
gone
up
there
for
the
past
i
have
been
considering
seriously
going
up
there
myself
we
left
him
still
considering
seriously
the
rest
of
the
audience
had
settled
down
for
an
evening
of
pleasant
gossip
having
apparently
forgotten
the
pastores
altogether
outside
the
with
our
peso
had
long
since
gathered
his
companions
to
him
and
sought
the
pleasing
hilarity
of
a
cantina
and
so
we
strolled
slowly
up
the
street
toward
the
edge
of
town
where
the
whitewashed
plaster
walls
of
rich
men
s
houses
give
way
to
the
undecorated
adobes
of
the
poor
there
all
pretense
of
streets
ended
and
we
went
along
burro
paths
between
huts
scattered
according
to
their
owners
whims
through
dilapidated
corrals
to
the
house
of
the
widow
of
don
tomas
it
was
built
of
mud
bricks
jutting
part
way
into
the
mountain
itself
and
looked
as
the
stable
of
bethlehem
must
have
looked
as
if
to
carry
out
the
analogy
a
great
cow
lay
in
the
moonlight
just
beneath
the
window
breathing
and
chewing
her
cud
through
the
window
and
the
door
over
a
throng
of
heads
we
could
see
candle
light
playing
on
the
ceiling
and
hear
a
whining
chant
sung
by
girlish
voices
and
the
beat
of
crooks
keeping
time
on
the
floor
with
jingling
bells
it
was
a
low
whitewashed
room
raftered
and
wattled
with
mud
above
like
any
peasant
dwelling
in
italy
or
palestine
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
door
was
a
little
table
heaped
with
paper
flowers
where
two
tall
church
candles
burned
above
it
on
the
wall
hung
a
chromo
of
the
virgin
and
child
and
in
the
middle
of
the
flowers
was
set
a
tiny
wooden
model
of
a
cradle
in
which
lay
a
leaden
doll
to
represent
the
infant
jesus
all
the
rest
of
the
room
except
for
a
small
space
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
was
packed
with
humanity
a
fringe
of
children
sitting
around
the
stage
and
girls
kneeling
and
behind
them
until
they
choked
the
doorway
blanketed
peons
with
their
hats
off
eager
and
curious
by
some
exquisite
chance
a
woman
sat
next
to
the
altar
her
breast
exposed
as
she
nursed
her
baby
other
women
with
their
babies
stood
along
the
wall
on
both
sides
of
her
except
for
a
narrow
curtained
entrance
into
another
room
where
we
could
hear
the
giggling
of
the
performers
has
it
begun
i
asked
a
boy
next
to
me
no
he
answered
they
just
came
out
to
sing
a
song
to
see
if
the
stage
was
big
enough
it
was
a
merry
noisy
crowd
bandying
jokes
and
gossip
across
each
others
heads
many
of
the
men
were
exhilarated
with
singing
snatches
of
ribald
songs
with
their
arms
around
each
other
s
shoulders
and
breaking
out
every
now
and
then
into
fierce
little
quarrels
that
might
have
led
to
they
were
all
armed
and
right
in
the
middle
of
everything
a
voice
said
they
are
going
to
begin
now
the
curtain
was
lifted
and
hurled
from
heaven
because
of
his
invincible
pride
stood
before
us
it
was
a
young
the
performers
are
girls
in
distinction
to
the
miracle
plays
where
the
actors
were
boys
she
wore
a
costume
whose
every
part
had
been
handed
down
from
immeasurable
antiquity
it
was
red
of
conventional
medieval
color
for
devils
but
the
exciting
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
evidently
the
traditional
rendering
of
the
uniform
of
a
roman
legionary
and
the
roman
soldiers
who
crucified
christ
were
considered
a
little
less
than
devils
in
the
middle
ages
she
wore
a
wide
skirted
doublet
of
red
leather
under
which
were
scalloped
trousers
falling
almost
to
the
shoe
tops
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
much
connection
here
until
you
remember
that
the
roman
legionaries
in
britain
and
in
spain
wore
leather
trousers
her
helmet
was
greatly
distorted
because
feathers
and
flowers
had
been
fastened
to
it
but
underneath
you
could
trace
the
resemblance
to
the
roman
helmet
a
cuirass
covered
her
breast
and
back
instead
of
steel
it
was
made
of
small
mirrors
and
a
sword
hung
at
her
side
drawing
the
sword
she
strutted
about
pitching
her
voice
to
imitate
a
man

the
audience
that

shouted
one
irrepressible
revolutionist

behold

and
continued
luzbel
just
then
a
large
dog
came
through
the
curtain
cheerfully
wagging
his
tail
immensely
pleased
with
himself
he
nosed
among
the
children
licking
a
face
here
and
there
one
baby
slapped
him
violently
and
the
dog
hurt
and
astonished
made
a
rush
between
legs
in
the
midst
of
that
sublime
peroration

second
time
fell
and

amid
the
wild
hilarity
of

fifty
of
the
audience
descended
upon
the
dog
and
ejected
him
howling
and
the
play
went
on
married
to
a
shepherd
appeared
singing
at
the
door
of
her
is
to
say
through
the
curtain
how
peacefully
falls
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
this
supremely
beautiful
night
nature
appears
to
be
on
the
point
of
revealing
some
wonderful
secret
the
whole
world
is
at
peace
and
all
hearts
methinks
are
overflowing
with
joy
and
contentment
is
such
pleasing
presence
and
fascinating
figure
prinked
and
strutted
avowing
with
latin
boldness
his
love
for
her
she
replied
that
her
heart
was
but
the
dwelt
upon
her
husband
s
poverty
and
himself
promised
her
riches
towering
palaces
jewels
and
slaves
i
feel
that
i
am
beginning
to
love
thee
said
against
my
can
not
deceive
at
this
point
there
was
smothered
laughter
in
the
audience
antonia
antonia
said
everybody
grinning
and
nudging
that
s
just
the
way
antonia
left
enrique
i
always
thought
the
devil
was
in
it
remarked
one
of
the
women
but
had
pangs
of
conscience
about
poor
insinuated
that
was
secretly
in
love
with
another
and
that
settled
it
so
that
thou
mayst
not
be
troubled
said
calmly
and
so
that
i
may
be
free
from
him
i
shall
even
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
kill
him
this
was
a
shock
even
to
he
suggested
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
feel
the
pangs
of
jealousy
and
in
an
exultant
aside
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
her
feet
are
already
in
the
direct
pathway
to
hell
the
women
apparently
felt
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
at
this
they
nodded
virtuously
to
one
another
but
one
young
girl
leaned
over
to
another
and
sighing
said
ah
but
it
must
be
wonderful
to
love
like
that
returned
to
be
reproached
by
with
his
poverty
he
was
accompanied
by
a
combination
of
and
who
attended
the
dialogue
between
the
shepherd
and
his
wife
with
ironical
asides
by
means
of
the
jeweled
ring
that
had
given
suspicions
were
aroused
and
when
had
left
him
in
haughty
insolence
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
just
when
i
was
happy
in
her
fidelity
she
with
cruel
reproaches
embitters
my
heart
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
look
for
a
new
mate
said
that
being
rejected
gave
the
following
modest
prescription
for
settling
the
difficulty
kill
her
without
delay
this
done
take
her
skin
and
carefully
fold
it
away
shouldst
thou
marry
again
let
the
bride
s
sheet
be
that
skin
and
thus
prevent
another
jilting
to
still
further
strengthen
her
virtue
tell
her
gently
but
firmly
sweetheart
this
thy
sheet
was
once
my
wife
see
that
thou
dost
carry
thyself
circumspectly
lest
thou
too
come
to
the
same
end
remember
that
i
am
a
hard
and
peevish
man
who
does
not
stick
at
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
the
men
began
to
snicker
and
when
it
ended
they
were
guffawing
loudly
an
old
peon
however
turned
furiously
on
them
there
is
a
proper
prescription
he
said
if
that
were
done
more
often
there
would
not
be
so
many
domestic
troubles
but
didn
t
seem
to
see
it
and
recommended
the
philosophic
attitude
stop
thy
complaining
and
leave
to
her
lover
free
thus
from
obligations
thou
wilt
become
rich
and
be
able
to
eat
well
dress
well
and
truly
enjoy
life
the
rest
matters
but
little
seize
therefore
this
opportunity
toward
thine
own
good
fortune
and
do
not
forget
i
beg
thee
once
thy
fortune
is
made
to
regale
this
meager
paunch
of
mine
with
good
cheer
shame
cried
the
women
clucking
how
false
the
a
man
s
voice
piped
up
there
is
some
truth
in
that
señoras
if
it
weren
t
for
the
women
and
children
we
all
might
be
able
to
dress
in
fine
clothes
and
ride
upon
a
horse
a
fierce
argument
grew
up
around
this
point
lost
patience
with
and
the
latter
plaintively
said
if
thou
hast
any
regard
for
poor
let
us
go
to
supper
answered
firmly
not
until
he
had
unburdened
his
heart
unburden
and
welcome
said
until
thou
art
tired
as
for
me
i
shall
put
such
a
knot
in
my
tongue
that
even
shouldst
thou
chatter
like
a
parrot
i
shall
be
mute
he
seated
himself
on
a
large
rock
and
pretended
to
sleep
and
then
for
fifteen
minutes
unburdened
himself
to
the
mountains
and
the
stars
oh
inconstant
ungrateful
and
inhuman
why
hast
thou
caused
me
such
woe
thou
hast
wounded
my
faith
and
my
honor
and
hast
put
my
soul
in
torment
why
dost
thou
mock
my
ardent
love
oh
thou
steep
stills
and
towering
mountains
help
me
to
express
my
woe
and
thou
stern
immovable
cliffs
and
thou
silent
woods
help
me
to
ease
my
heart
of
its
pain
amid
heartfelt
and
sympathetic
silence
the
audience
mourned
with
a
few
women
sobbed
openly
finally
could
stand
it
no
longer
let
us
go
to
supper
he
said
better
it
is
to
suffer
a
little
at
a
time
a
perfect
gale
of
laughter
cut
off
the
end
of
the
sentence
to
thee
only
have
i
confided
my
secret
aside
i
do
not
believe
i
can
keep
it
already
my
mouth
itches
to
tell
it
this
fool
will
learn
that
a
secret
and
a
pledge
to
none
should
be
enter
a
group
of
shepherds
with
their
shepherdesses
singing
they
were
dressed
in
their
feminine
sunday
best
with
flowery
summer
hats
and
carried
enormous
wooden
apostolic
crooks
hung
with
paper
flowers
and
strings
of
bells
beautiful
is
this
night
beyond
compare
and
peaceful
as
never
before
happy
the
mortal
who
beholds
proclaims
that
the
son
of
god
word
divine
made
human
flesh
soon
be
born
in
mankind
s
ransom
be
complete
then
followed
a
dialogue
between
miserly
and
his
sprightly
young
wife
to
which
all
present
contributed
upon
the
subject
of
the
great
virtues
of
women
and
the
great
failings
of
men
the
audience
joined
violently
in
the
discussion
hurling
the
words
of
the
play
back
and
and
women
drawing
together
in
two
solid
hostile
bodies
the
women
were
supported
by
the
words
of
the
play
but
the
men
had
the
conspicuous
example
of
to
draw
from
it
passed
soon
into
an
argument
about
the
virtues
and
failings
of
certain
married
couples
in
el
oro
the
play
suspended
for
some
time
one
of
the
shepherds
stole
wallet
from
between
his
knees
as
he
slept
then
came
gossip
and
backbiting
forced
to
share
with
him
the
contents
of
the
stolen
wallet
which
they
opened
to
find
none
of
the
food
they
expected
in
their
disappointment
both
declared
their
willingness
to
sell
their
souls
to
the
devil
for
a
good
meal
overheard
the
declaration
and
attempted
to
bind
them
to
it
but
after
a
battle
of
wits
between
the
rustics
and
the
audience
solid
to
a
man
against
the
underhanded
tactics
of
was
decided
by
a
throw
of
the
dice
at
which
the
devil
lost
but
he
had
told
them
where
food
could
be
obtained
and
they
went
for
it
cursed
god
for
interfering
in
behalf
of
two
worthless
shepherds
he
marveled
that
a
hand
mightier
than
has
been
stretched
out
to
save
he
wondered
at
the
everlasting
mercy
toward
worthless
man
who
has
been
a
persistent
sinner
down
the
ages
while
he
had
felt
god
s
wrath
so
heavily
sweet
music
was
suddenly
shepherds
singing
behind
the
mused
upon
daniel
s
prophecy
that
the
divine
word
shall
be
made
flesh
the
music
continued
announcing
the
birth
of
christ
among
the
shepherds
enraged
swore
that
he
would
use
all
his
power
to
the
end
that
all
mortals
shall
at
some
time
taste
hell
and
commanded
hell
to
open
and
receive
him
in
its
center
at
the
birth
of
christ
the
spectators
crossed
themselves
the
women
muttering
prayers
impotent
raging
against
god
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
blasphemy
sacrilege
death
to
the
devil
for
insulting
god
and
returned
ill
from
overeating
and
believing
they
were
about
to
die
called
wildly
for
help
then
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
came
in
singing
and
pounding
the
floor
with
their
crooks
as
they
promised
they
would
cure
them
at
the
beginning
of
act
ii
and
fully
restored
to
health
were
discovered
again
plotting
to
steal
and
eat
the
provisions
laid
by
for
a
village
festival
and
as
they
went
out
to
do
so
appeared
singing
of
her
love
for
heavenly
music
was
heard
rebuking
her
for
her
adulterous
thoughts
whereupon
she
renounced
all
desire
for
guilty
love
and
declared
that
she
would
be
content
with
the
women
of
the
audience
rustled
and
nodded
and
smiled
at
these
exemplary
sentiments
sighs
of
relief
were
heard
all
over
the
house
that
the
play
was
coming
out
right
but
just
afterward
the
sound
of
a
falling
roof
was
heard
and
comic
relief
in
the
persons
of
and
entered
carrying
a
basket
of
food
and
a
bottle
of
wine
everybody
brightened
up
at
the
appearance
of
these
beloved
crooks
anticipatory
mirth
went
around
the
room
suggested
that
he
eat
his
half
while
stood
guard
whereupon
ate
share
too
in
the
midst
of
the
quarrel
that
followed
before
they
could
hide
the
traces
of
their
guilt
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
came
back
in
search
of
the
thief
many
and
absurd
were
the
reasons
invented
by
and
to
explain
the
presence
of
the
food
and
drink
which
they
finally
managed
to
convince
the
company
was
of
diabolical
origin
in
order
to
further
cover
their
traces
they
invited
the
others
to
eat
what
is
left
this
scene
the
most
comic
of
the
whole
play
could
hardly
be
heard
for
the
roars
of
laughter
that
interrupted
every
speech
a
young
fellow
reached
over
and
punched
a
do
you
remember
how
we
got
out
of
it
when
they
caught
us
milking
don
pedro
s
cows
returned
and
was
invited
to
join
the
feast
he
incited
them
maliciously
to
continue
discussion
of
the
robbery
and
little
by
little
to
place
the
blame
upon
a
stranger
whom
they
all
agreed
having
seen
of
course
they
meant
but
upon
being
invited
to
describe
him
they
depicted
a
monster
a
thousand
times
more
repulsive
than
the
reality
none
suspected
that
the
apparently
amiable
stranger
seated
in
their
midst
was
how
and
were
at
last
discovered
and
punished
how
and
were
reconciled
how
was
rebuked
for
his
avariciousness
and
saw
the
error
of
his
ways
how
the
infant
jesus
was
shown
lying
in
his
manger
with
the
three
strongly
individualized
kings
out
of
the
east
how
was
finally
discovered
and
cast
back
into
have
not
space
here
to
describe
the
play
lasted
for
three
hours
absorbing
all
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
their
enthusiastic
approbation
they
sympathized
with
suffered
with
and
hated
with
the
hatred
of
gallery
gods
for
the
villain
in
the
melodrama
only
once
was
the
play
interrupted
when
a
hatless
youth
rushed
in
and
shouted
a
man
has
come
from
the
army
who
says
that
urbina
has
taken
mapimi
even
the
performers
stopped
were
pounding
the
floor
with
jingling
crooks
at
the
a
whirlwind
of
questions
beat
upon
the
newcomer
but
in
a
minute
the
interest
passed
and
the
shepherds
took
up
their
song
where
they
had
dropped
it
when
we
left
doña
perdita
s
house
about
midnight
the
moon
had
already
gone
behind
the
western
mountains
and
a
barking
dog
was
all
the
noise
in
the
dark
sharp
night
it
flashed
upon
me
as
fidencio
and
i
went
home
with
our
arms
about
each
others
shoulders
that
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
which
had
preceded
the
golden
age
of
the
theater
in
flowering
of
the
renaissance
it
was
amusing
to
speculate
what
the
mexican
renaissance
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
come
so
late
but
already
around
the
narrow
shores
of
the
mexican
middle
ages
beat
the
great
seas
of
modern
scientific
thought
and
political
theory
mexico
will
have
to
skip
for
a
time
her
golden
age
of
drama
